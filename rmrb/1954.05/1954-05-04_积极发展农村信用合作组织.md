Vigorously Develop Rural Credit Cooperatives
Yang Fangxun

Actively developing rural credit cooperative organizations is an important task in realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its December 1953 Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives: "Agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, rural supply and marketing cooperation, and rural credit cooperation are the three forms of rural cooperation. These three types of cooperation divide labor and are interconnected and mutually promote each other, thereby gradually linking rural economic activities with the country's economic construction plans, and gradually transforming the small-scale peasant economy on the basis of production cooperation."

In the past few years, China's rural credit cooperative organizations have begun to develop. They have played a certain role in accumulating idle rural funds, helping farmers solve difficulties in production and life, combating usurious exploitation in rural areas, and promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, they have been loved and trusted by farmers. However, it must be pointed out that rural credit cooperation is currently the weakest link in our country's rural work, and credit cooperative organizations still lag behind the needs of the state and farmers.

At present, there are three forms of rural credit cooperative organizations: credit cooperatives, credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit mutual aid groups. According to incomplete statistics in 1953: there was an average of one credit cooperative for every twenty-six townships; one credit department of a supply and marketing cooperative for every eighty-nine townships; and one credit mutual aid group for every eighteen townships. Moreover, the development of credit cooperation is very uneven. About 50 percent of the counties in the country have no or very few credit cooperative organizations. And about 30 percent of the existing credit cooperative organizations do not have a very solid foundation. Some credit organizations have unclear business policies, poor management, and have not developed their business. Their shares and deposits are very small, and some rely on large loans from state banks to maintain themselves; some cannot even maintain their expenses and suffer losses; and individual credit cooperative organizations have capitalist business ideas, believing that commercial loans are "short-term, high-interest, and repaid quickly." Therefore, they do not pay attention to helping farmers solve production problems, but lend large amounts of funds to private merchants. Obviously, the slow development and low quality of rural credit cooperation cannot meet the current needs of the widespread development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the greater demand for production funds from the majority of farmers.

Recently, the head office of the People's Bank of China convened a credit cooperation symposium to review the rural credit cooperation work of the past few years, determined the direction for the future development of rural credit cooperation, and preliminarily formulated a plan for developing credit cooperative organizations this year based on the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. It should be seen that there are very good conditions for developing rural credit cooperation at present. After publicizing the state's general task during the transition period and implementing the policy of planned purchase and supply of grain, the socialist consciousness of the masses of farmers has been greatly improved, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement is at a new climax. Farmers have an urgent demand for the development of credit cooperation. Therefore, as long as party and government organs at all levels strengthen their leadership in this area of work, and banks at all levels strengthen their guidance and assistance in business, rural credit cooperation work will develop rapidly and substantially.

To rapidly develop rural credit cooperative organizations, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the principle of "active leadership and steady progress." In the past few years, due to insufficient understanding of the important significance of credit cooperation by party and government leaders and banking departments in some areas, and underestimation of the seriousness of the development of usury in rural areas after the land reform, they neglected active leadership over credit cooperation, causing many areas to remain in the stage of key pilot projects for a long time, making no steady progress. At present, it is necessary to vigorously overcome this laissez-faire attitude of inactive leadership, actively develop and do a good job in rural credit cooperation, and promote the development of agricultural production. In areas with a better foundation for credit cooperation, efforts should be made to basically universalize credit cooperative organizations within two or three years; in areas with a relatively poor foundation, the development time can be appropriately extended; as for areas with no experience in running credit cooperatives, it is necessary to quickly conduct typical pilot projects, gain experience, and then promote them.

The development of rural credit cooperation, like other agricultural cooperation work, must adhere to the principles of "voluntariness" and "mutual benefit." The Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The development of agricultural cooperation must be based on the fundamental principle of farmers' voluntariness, at any time and in any place." In the past, when some areas organized credit cooperatives, they did not do enough publicity to the farmers, and did not proceed from the farmers' level of understanding, but relied solely on subjective wishes, hoping to quickly organize all the farmers. As a result, there was a tendency to force people to buy shares, which should be resolutely overcome in the future. In order to encourage farmers to actively participate in credit cooperative organizations, we must conduct in-depth and extensive publicity to the farmers. Combined with the suffering that farmers have experienced from usurious exploitation, it should be explained that organizing funds is one of the main ways to combat usurious exploitation and avoid bankruptcy due to debt; in addition, it is necessary to address the ideological concerns of some farmers who are "afraid of revealing wealth" and "afraid that deposits cannot be withdrawn upon maturity," and explain the state's policies of supporting agricultural production and lending. And we should also educate farmers, explaining that credit cooperative organizations are mutual aid organizations for the funds of working farmers, and that their business policy is to serve agricultural production, promote rural cooperation, and that it is not aimed at exploiting others and pursuing profits. Therefore, its deposit and loan interest rates should generally be low-interest policies. This is in the interest of the majority of farmers. As long as the above education is carried out to the farmers, more and more farmers can be attracted to participate in the credit cooperative organizations, and the internal unity of the farmers can be strengthened, and the organization of credit cooperation can be consolidated and developed.

Starting from organizing farmers' production is the basic method for carrying out credit cooperation business. The basic task of credit cooperatives is to serve agricultural production and promote the development of rural production mutual aid and cooperation. Today, the basic requirements of the masses of farmers for credit cooperative organizations are to help them overcome difficulties, develop production, and help consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperation. Whether or not these requirements of the masses of farmers can be met is the key to the success or failure of credit cooperative organizations and the basic standard for running credit cooperative organizations well. Therefore, all business activities of credit cooperative organizations must proceed from this basic requirement, and the lending policy must be based on supporting the production of members and supporting the development and consolidation of mutual aid and cooperation. In order to complete this task, credit cooperative organizations should strengthen their combination with mutual aid teams, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives. In recent years, various regions have gained a lot of experience in this regard. Last year, the "deposit and loan contracts" and "three-ring contracts" signed by credit cooperative organizations, supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production mutual aid teams, and agricultural producers' cooperatives in many regions were a better way to strengthen this combination. Last spring, the Zhang Wangqu Village Credit Cooperative in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, signed a triangular contact contract with the supply and marketing cooperative and 183 households, including the village's mutual aid team and some individual farmers, to produce 9,800 reed mats. The supply and marketing cooperative was responsible for the sales of raw materials and finished products, and the credit cooperative was responsible for adjusting funds. This not only solved the food problem of 183 farmers, but also added seven head of draft animals and ten handcarts. Many farmers said: "Production, supply and marketing, and credit are three links, and one is indispensable." This enables the credit cooperative organization to combine with rural production and supply and marketing in a planned way. In order to strengthen the combination of these aspects, credit cooperative cadres must regularly and proactively understand the production and funding situation of production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers, help formulate production plans, find production methods, and provide loan assistance based on actual needs, which can ensure the proper use of loans and repayment on time, and can also attract deposits.

Strengthening democratic management is an important condition for the consolidation and development of credit cooperative organizations. In order to strengthen democratic management, the spirit of democratic management should be fully implemented in business operations and cooperative affairs management to promote the enthusiasm of members. According to the methods of implementing democratic management in various regions, the following experiences can be used for reference: (1) Organize the board of directors and member groups; (2) Strengthen the activities of member groups, and regularly convey the situation of the cooperative to the members through the group leaders and solicit opinions; large loans should be reviewed by the member groups and approved by the board of directors. In this way, on the one hand, the rationality of the loan purpose and object is guaranteed, and on the other hand, the contradiction between the large number of loan applicants and the small amount of credit union funds can be resolved. After the loan was reviewed by the member group, some members said: "If we do this, we have no objection even if we can't get the loan"; (3) Regularly report the business and financial situation to the members' congress or the members' representative congress and publish the accounts. Major issues of the credit union, such as the admission of members and the interest rates for deposits and loans, must be discussed and decided by the members' congress. In short, the credit union must stipulate some simple and easy-to-implement methods so that members can regularly understand and supervise the business of the union and put forward suggestions for improvement.

Establishing good credit is also very important. At present, some farmers are unwilling to deposit their temporarily unused money into credit cooperatives, mainly because they are afraid that it will be "easy to deposit but difficult to withdraw," so establishing good credit is very important. Credit unions must guarantee that deposits can be withdrawn upon maturity, and if farmers have urgent needs, they can withdraw them at any time, even if they have not matured. Only when credit unions can regularly maintain good credit will farmers deposit their temporarily unused money without any worries. The basis for establishing good credit is that loans must be repaid when they are due. At present, a small number of farmers and village cadres have outstanding loans for a long time, causing difficulties in the turnover of credit union funds and affecting the development of business. This phenomenon should be overcome.

China's rural areas are moving along the road of collectivization. Rural credit cooperation must adapt to the needs of the increasingly high tide of development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and vigorously promote the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. At present, we should strive to do the above tasks so that rural credit cooperation work can be developed in a guided, rapid, and healthy manner. This is the glorious task of rural financial workers.

    积极发展农村信用合作组织
    杨方勋
    积极发展农村信用合作组织，是实现农业社会主义改造的一项重要工作。中共中央一九五三年十二月关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中指出：“农业生产互助合作、农村供销合作和农村信用合作是农村合作化的三种形式。这三种合作互相分工而又互相联系和互相促进，从而逐步地把农村的经济活动与国家的经济建设计划联结起来，逐步地在生产合作的基础上，改造小农经济。”
    过去几年，我国农村信用合作组织开始有了发展。对积聚农村闲散资金，帮助农民解决生产、生活方面的困难，打击农村高利贷的剥削活动，促进互助合作运动的发展，已起了一定的作用。因而得到了农民的热爱和信任。但必须指出：农村信用合作工作，是我国目前农村工作中最薄弱的一环，信用合作组织还落后于国家和农民的需要。
    目前农村信用合作组织有三种形式，即信用合作社、供销合作社信用部、信用互助小组。根据一九五三年不完整的统计：信用合作社平均二十六个乡才有一个；供销合作社信用部平均八十九个乡才有一个；信用互助小组平均十八个乡才有一个。并且，信用合作工作发展得很不平衡，全国约有百分之五十的县还没有或很少有信用合作组织。而现有的信用合作组织约有百分之三十左右的基础还不十分巩固。有些信用组织业务方针不明确，经营管理不善，业务未开展起来，股金和存款都很少，有的依赖国家银行大量贷款维持；有的甚至不能维持开支，发生亏损；还有个别的信用合作组织存在着资本主义经营思想，认为商业放款“期限短、利息高、还的快”，因此不注意帮助农民解决生产上的困难，却把大批资金贷给私商。显然，农村信用合作工作这种发展迟缓和质量还不高的情况，是不能适应目前互助合作运动已普遍发展、广大农民对扩大生产资金有了更多要求的需要的。
    最近人民银行总行召开了信用合作座谈会，检查了过去几年农村信用合作工作，确定了今后发展农村信用合作的方针，并且根据农村互助合作运动的发展，初步拟定了今年发展信用合作组织的计划。应该看到：目前发展农村信用合作有着很好的条件。向农民宣传了国家在过渡时期的总任务，粮食计划收购计划供应政策的实施后，农民群众的社会主义觉悟已大大提高，互助合作运动正处在新的高潮，农民对发展信用合作有了迫切的要求。所以，只要各地党政机关加强这方面工作的领导，各级银行在业务上加强指导和帮助，那末，农村信用合作工作是会迅速地大量地发展起来的。
    要使农村信用合作组织迅速发展起来，必须认真执行“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针。过去几年，由于有些地区的党政领导和银行部门对信用合作的重要意义认识不够，对土地改革后农村高利贷发展的严重情况估计不足，因而忽视了对信用合作的积极领导，致使不少地区长期停留在重点试办阶段，稳步不前。目前必须大力克服这种不积极领导的放任自流态度，积极发展和做好农村信用合作工作，促进农业生产的发展。在信用合作基础比较好的地区，应该争取在两三年内基本上做到信用合作组织普遍化；基础比较差的地区，发展时间可适当放长；至于还没有办信用合作社经验的地区，必须迅速进行典型试办，取得经验，再行推广。
    发展农村信用合作和其他各项农业合作工作一样，必须坚持“自愿”与“互利”的原则。党中央指出：“发展农业合作化，无论何时何地，都必须根据农民自愿这一个根本的原则。”过去有些地区组织信用合作社时，对农民宣传不够，不从农民的认识水平出发，单凭主观愿望办事，希望很快把农民都组织起来，因而发生强迫入股的倾向，今后应坚决克服。为了鼓舞农民积极参加信用合作组织的情绪，我们必须对农民进行深入的广泛的宣传。结合农民曾经身受高利贷剥削的苦痛，说明从资金上组织起来是打击高利贷剥削，避免因负债而破产的主要方法之一；另外，还要针对有些农民“怕露富”、
  “怕存款到期不能取”等的思想顾虑，说明国家的扶助农业生产政策和借贷政策。并且还应该教育农民，说明信用合作组织，是劳动农民的资金互助组织，它的业务方针是为农业生产服务，促进农村合作化，它不是以剥削别人追逐利润为目的。所以，它的存放款的利率一般应是低利政策。这是符合于大多数农民的利益的。只要向农民进行了以上的教育，就能吸引愈来愈多的农民参加到信用合作组织里来，并能加强农民内部的团结，巩固和发展信用合作的组织。
    从组织农民生产着手，是开展信用合作业务的基本方法。信用合作社的基本任务是为农业生产服务，促进农村生产互助合作的发展。今天农民群众对信用合作组织的基本要求也就是帮助他们克服困难，发展生产和帮助互助合作的巩固与发展，是否能够满足农民群众这些要求，就是信用合作组织的成败关键和办好信用合作组织的基本标准。所以信用合作组织的一切业务活动都必须从这一基本要求出发，放款政策必须以扶植社员生产，扶助互助合作的发展和巩固为基本目的。为了完成这一任务，信用合作组织应当加强和互助组、农业生产合作社、供销合作社的结合。几年来各地区在这方面都有了不少经验。去年不少地区的信用合作组织和供销社、农业生产互助组、农业生产合作社签订的“存贷合同”和“三连环合同”，就是加强结合的一个较好办法。陕西省长安县张旺渠村信用合作社去年春天和供销合作社以及该村互助组和部分单干农民共一百八十三户订立三角联系合同，生产芦席九千八百张，由供销合作社负责原料和成品推销，信用合作社负责调剂资金，不但解决了一百八十三户农民的口粮问题，并添置了耕畜七头和手推车十辆。许多农民说：“生产、供销、信用是三连环，缺一不可。”这就使信用合作组织与农村的生产、供销有计划地结合起来。为了加强这几方面的结合，信用合作社干部要经常的、主动的去了解生产合作社、互助组和个体农民的生产情况与资金情况，帮助订生产计划，找生产门路并根据实际需要，贷款扶助，这就能够保证贷款用途正当和按期归还，而且可以吸收存款。
    加强民主管理是信用合作组织能否巩固与发展的重要条件。为要加强民主管理，在业务经营上、社务管理上应全面贯彻民主管理精神，以发扬社员的积极性。根据各地实行民主管理的办法，下列经验可供参考：（一）组织理事会与社员小组；（二）加强社员小组的活动，经常把社的情况，通过小组长传达给社员，并征求意见；大额贷款要经过社员小组评议，理事会审查批准。这样，一方面保证贷款用途与对象的合理，另外可以解决要求贷款人多、信用社资金少的矛盾。贷款经过社员小组评议后，有些社员说：“这样作，咱就贷不到款也没意见了”；（三）定期向社员大会或社员代表大会报告业务、财务状况并公布账目，信用社的重大问题，如吸收社员，规定存放款利息等，必须经过社员大会讨论决定。总之信用社要规定一些简单易行的办法，使社员能经常了解与监督社的业务，并提出改进意见。
    建立良好的信用也是十分重要的。目前有些农民不愿把暂时不用的钱存入信用合作社，主要原因是怕“存进容易，取出难”，所以建立良好的信用十分重要。信用社要保证存款到期支取，农民如有急需，虽未到期，随时可取。只有信用社能够经常保持良好的信用，农民才会毫无顾虑地把暂时不用的钱存进去。建立良好信用的基础是贷款到期，必须归还。目前有少数农民和村干部贷款长期不还，造成信用社资金周转困难，影响业务开展，这种现象，应该予以克服。
    我国农村正沿着合作化的道路前进。农村信用合作工作必须适应日益高涨着的农业生产互助合作发展的需要；并大力促进农业生产互助合作的发展。当前就应该努力做到以上各项工作，使农村信用合作工作得到有领导地、迅速地、健康地发展。这是农村金融工作人员的光荣任务。
