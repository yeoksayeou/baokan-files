Experiences in Grain Planned Supply Work in Houtun Township, Jiaoxian County
Chinese Communist Party Shandong Jiaozhou Local Committee

Houtun Township, Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, has 702 households with 3,069 people and 12,504 mu of land. Last year, due to natural disasters, the township's average yield decreased by about 20%. Since last winter, the township has implemented the general line education and production, mutual aid and cooperation, and grain unified purchase and sales work, which has greatly improved the socialist awareness of cadres and the masses, completed the task of purchasing more than 135,000 jin of grain (plus more than 64,000 jin of sweet potato dried slices), and promoted the development of production, mutual aid and cooperation. At the same time, it carried out planned supply to grain-deficient households before the spring plowing. In late February this year, the township closely integrated production and mutual aid and cooperation work and carried out grain planned supply work before the wheat harvest (until the end of June), achieving positive results.

The specific practices of the township are: First, correct the understanding of Party members and cadres on grain supply work, and educate them to consciously and actively lead and do a good job in the unified sales work. At the beginning, township and village cadres lacked a complete understanding of the relationship between unified purchase and unified sales, believing that "unified purchase is a task" and "unified sales is not a task," so they only managed unified purchase and ignored unified sales. They did not fully understand the complexity and arduousness of the unified sales work, thinking that "unified sales is easy, unified purchase is difficult," and "farmers selling grain need education, but buying grain does not need mobilization." Their understanding of the significance, policies, supply targets, and standards of unified sales was vague, and they misunderstood unified sales as "selling to whoever comes to buy, and giving as much as they buy." Some cadres even wanted to buy grain and hoard it.

In response to the above incorrect understanding, Houtun Township convened an enlarged meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's township and village branch committees. At the meeting, everyone realized that unified purchase is for unified sales, and only by doing a good job in unified purchase can the needs of unified sales be met, and only by doing a good job in unified sales can the purpose of unified purchase be achieved. Through reviewing and summarizing the work of the previous stage of unified purchase and sales, the cadres clearly realized the importance of doing a good job in grain unified sales. Some cadres said, "In the past, we only managed unified purchase and did not manage unified sales, which is like walking on one leg." Some said: "If unified sales is not done well, unified purchase is in vain." Therefore, they all consciously examined and criticized various incorrect understandings of unified sales work, and expressed that they would "resolutely do a good job in unified sales work and be a good housekeeper for the entire township." Based on the above ideological improvement, they further studied the unified sales policy and the supply targets and standards, and through studying the situation of grain-deficient households in the township and villages, they realized the complexity, arduousness, and favorable conditions of unified sales and studied specific practices.

Secondly, continue to carry out general line education for farmers and deeply publicize the grain unified purchase and sales policy. Since Houtun Township carried out general line education and winter production work last November, the masses' political awareness has improved. However, due to the lack of comprehensive and complete publicity of the unified purchase and sales policy in the past, some misunderstandings and doubts still exist among the masses: Some were afraid that this year's harvest would be poor and grain would be scarce, so they bought grain even if they were not short, or bought more if they were short; some farmers thought that implementing the grain unified purchase and sales policy was inconvenient; some farmers misunderstood the unified purchase and sales policy as "the state only buys but does not sell"; the policy boundary between banning grain dealers and allowing farmers to make adjustments between themselves was unclear.

In response to the above ideological situation, Houtun Township first used specific examples to make farmers realize the benefits of grain unified purchase and sales for the country and for farmers. 1. Turning dead grain into live grain, investment has expanded production. According to incomplete statistics: After selling grain, the township has bought 50 pigs and 51 head of livestock; and 120 households have bought fertilizer powder, bran, manure and other fertilizers; saved 65 million yuan, and the interest alone in half a year can buy 4,457 jin of fertilizer powder, which can plant 297 mu of millet, which can increase the yield by 50 to 60 jin per mu, and a total of 16,000 to 17,000 jin can be increased. 2. It guaranteed the stability of grain prices and commodity prices. For example, before the implementation of unified purchase and sales, grain merchants disrupted the market, wheat rose to 1,700 yuan per jin, and dried melon slices rose to 950 yuan per jin; since the implementation of unified purchase and sales, grain prices have quickly stabilized. Everyone said, "If unified purchase and sales were not implemented, we would not be able to buy grain to eat even if we had money this spring." 3. It guaranteed the supply of grain to households in need and avoided the exploitation of grain merchants. 4. From the facts such as banning grain speculation, avoiding usury exploitation, and greatly reducing land sales this spring, farmers further realized the relationship between the grain unified purchase and sales policy and the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy. Some farmers said, "Implementing unified purchase and sales has cut off the roots of poverty, blocked the road to poverty, and embarked on the road to prosperity."

Secondly, on the basis of improving the masses' thinking, further comprehensively publicize the unified purchase and sales policy. For the masses with surplus grain, publicize: Selling surplus grain to the state is beneficial to the country and to oneself, and both fame and fortune are achieved; for grain-deficient households, publicize: Implementing unified purchase and sales, you can buy the grain you actually need at a reasonable price, carefully calculate and save grain, which is also a manifestation of patriotism, which is beneficial to the country and to yourself, so you should buy according to actual needs, and should not buy more if you are short or buy even if you are not short. For households that need adjustment, explain: Resolutely ban the speculative activities of grain merchants and grain dealers, but adjustments between the masses are allowed. At the same time, deeply carry out education on increasing production and practicing economy, and through playing a score of increasing production and practicing economy, mobilize households with surplus grain to continue to sell surplus grain; mobilize grain-deficient households to carefully calculate and accumulate funds to invest in production.

Through education, the masses' awareness has been further improved, concerns have been eliminated, and they actively support the unified purchase and sales policy, and a number of activists have emerged. The masses generally reflected: "There is water in the big river, and the small river will not dry up. Only when the state controls the grain can we have a good life." "If planned supply is not implemented, whoever has money will sell to whoever has money. As a result, the grain will be bought by grain merchants, and the farmers will still suffer." Therefore, households with surplus grain continued to sell surplus grain. For example, farmer Zhang Lianzeng had previously sold 1,300 jin of surplus grain. This time, after education and playing the score of increasing production and practicing economy, he sold another 280 jin of surplus grain. Households that are not short of grain or are short of very little grain proposed: In order to support national construction and maintain expanded production, we must practice strict economy and not buy grain. For example, farmer Jin Shijiu originally planned to borrow 150,000 yuan from the bank to buy 200 jin of grain, but now he no longer borrows money to buy grain. He said: "I have no surplus grain to sell to the country. I want to save grain for the country. Every household saves, and if we accumulate little things, socialism can be realized soon." Grain-deficient households also expressed that they would save and spend sparingly and not buy too much grain from the state. Some said: "Socialism is built up brick by brick. Saving one jin of grain will increase the country's construction power by one point."

On the basis of improving the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses, Houtun Township conducted a survey of grain-deficient households. After generally understanding the number of grain-deficient households and the amount of grain, and cultivating typical examples and establishing correct examples, the following specific work was carried out: 1. Convene a meeting of grain-deficient households. At the meeting, further publicize the unified purchase and sales policy, explaining the supply targets, standards, and time. Activists spoke, and then the leadership put forward a supply list, democratically discussed and assessed the supply households, and through playing a score of increasing production and practicing economy, grain-deficient households reported the time of grain shortage and the actual amount needed, and then democratically assessed. 2. Publish the list of supply households to the masses for evaluation and finally pass it. The township adopted two methods: convening villagers' meetings and convening small meetings based on electoral districts, basically achieving correct supply and mass satisfaction. 3. Finally, after leadership approval, grain purchase certificates were issued. 4. At the same time, in conjunction with the unified sales work, relief was provided to 13 long-term households in difficulty, with a total of 470,000 yuan in relief funds distributed, and they were helped to develop scores of production for self-relief. The masses responded well, and some said: "The government not only guarantees the supply of grain to households in real need, but also provides relief to households in difficulty. The people's government is really concerned about the people everywhere."

After the above work, it was finally determined that a total of 92 households (414 people) in the township would be supplied before the wheat harvest, accounting for 13.1% of the total number of households. Among them, 27 households were short of grain for one month, 41 households were short of grain for two months, 20 households were short of grain for three months, and 4 households were short of grain for four months. A total of 13,460 jin of grain and dried melon slices were planned to be supplied, including 4,480 jin of coarse grain and 8,980 jin of dried melon slices (dried melon slices accounted for 66% of the total). The average per household was 146 jin. The masses are very satisfied with this grain supply work. They generally reflected: "Only by correctly implementing planned supply can grain be used where it is really needed. This is the right way to do it." Farmers who have sold surplus grain said: "The method of unified purchase and sales is really good. Households with surplus grain have expanded production after selling grain, and grain-deficient households have bought the grain they actually need, and production has also been guaranteed." Grain-deficient farmers said: "With the unified purchase and sales policy, we will never be exploited by grain merchants and usury lenders again. Let's work hard and focus on production!" Therefore, through the unified sales work, production, mutual aid and cooperation, and unified purchase work have been further promoted. Now, the township has formed a movement of harrowing the land, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations have also been further improved through the development of production and economy plans.

    胶县后屯乡粮食计划供应工作的经验
    中国共产党山东胶州地方委员会
    山东省胶县十区后屯乡共有七百零二户，三千零六十九人，土地一万二千五百零四亩。去年因自然灾害全乡平均减产两成左右。该乡自去冬贯彻总路线教育与生产、互助合作、粮食统购统销工作以来，大大提高了干部、群众的社会主义觉悟，完成了购粮十三万五千余斤的任务（外有地瓜干六万四千余斤），并推动了生产、互助合作工作的开展；同时，对春耕前的缺粮户，进行了计划供应。今年二月下旬，该乡又紧密结合生产、互助合作工作，进行了麦收前（至六月底）的粮食计划供应工作，取得了成绩。
    该乡的具体做法是：首先端正党员、干部对粮食供应工作的认识，教育他们自觉、积极地领导与做好统销工作。开始时，乡、村干部对统购与统销的关系，缺乏完整的了解，认为“统购是任务”，“统销不是任务”，因之只管统购，忽视统销；对统销工作的复杂性、艰巨性认识不足，认为“统销容易，统购难”，“农民卖粮要教育，买粮不用动员”；对统销的意义、政策和供应的对象、标准认识模糊，将统销误解为“谁来买就卖给谁，买多少给多少”；有的干部甚至还想买粮囤存。
    针对上述错误认识，后屯乡召开了中国共产党乡、村支委扩大会议，在会上，大家认识到统购是为了统销，只有做好统购才能满足统销的需要，也只有做好统销才能达到统购的目的。并通过检查和总结前一阶段统购统销的工作，使干部明确认识做好粮食统销工作的重要性，有的干部说：“过去光管统购，不管统销，就像一条腿走路。”有的说：
  “统销搞不好，统购白拉倒。”因之都自觉地检查和批判了对统销工作的各种错误认识，纷纷表示：“坚决做好统销工作，当好全乡的家。”在上述思想提高的基础上，进一步研究了统销政策和供应的对象、标准，并通过研究本乡、本村缺粮户的情况，认识到统销的复杂性、艰巨性和有利条件，研究了具体做法。
    其次，继续对农民进行总路线教育，深入地宣传粮食统购统销政策。该乡自去年十一月进行总路线教育与冬季生产工作以来，群众的政治觉悟有了提高，但由于过去全面完整地宣传统购统销政策不够，群众中还存有一些误解和疑虑：有些怕今年收成不好，粮食缺乏，因之不缺也买，缺少买多；有的农民认为实行粮食统购统销不方便；有的农民误解统购统销政策是“国家光买不卖”；对取缔粮贩和允许农民之间有无调剂的政策界限认识模糊。
    针对上述思想情况，后屯乡首先通过具体实例，使农民认识粮食统购统销对国家和对农民的好处。一、把死粮变活粮，投资扩大了生产。据不完全统计：卖粮后全乡已买入五十头猪、五一头牲口；并有一二○户买了肥田粉、麸皮、大粪等肥料；储蓄六五○○万元，半年内光利息就能买四四五七斤肥田粉，能种二九七亩谷子，每亩可增产五、六十斤，共可增产一万六、七千斤。二、保证了粮价和物价稳定。如实行统购统销前，粮食奸商扰乱市场，小麦涨到一千七百元一斤，瓜干涨到九百五十元一斤；自实行统购统销后，粮价就迅速平稳了。大家说：“如不实行统购统销，今春有钱也买不到粮食吃。”三、保证了缺粮实需户的供应，避免了粮商的剥削。四、从取缔粮食投机，避免高利贷剥削和今春土地买卖大大减少等事实，进一步使农民认识到粮食统购统销政策对小农经济实行社会主义改造的关系。有的农民说：“实行统购统销是刨断了穷根，堵死了穷路，走上了富路。”
    其次，在群众思想提高的基础上，进一步完整地宣传统购统销政策。对有余粮的群众宣传：把余粮卖给国家，功在国家，利在自己，名利双全；对缺粮户宣传：实行统购统销，可以按合理的价格买到实需的粮食，精打细算，节约粮食，同样是爱国主义的表现，对国家对自己都有好处，所以应当按实际需要购买，不应缺少买多或不缺也买。对需要调剂的户讲明：要坚决取缔粮商粮贩的投机活动，但群众之间的有无调剂是允许的。同时深入进行增产节约教育，并通过打增产节约谱，动员余粮户继续出卖余粮；动员缺粮户精打细算，积累资金投资生产。
    通过教育，进一步提高了群众觉悟，消除了顾虑，积极拥护统购统销政策，并涌现出一批积极分子。群众普遍反映：“大河里有水，小河里不干，只有国家掌握了粮食，咱才有好日子过”，“如果不实行计划供应，谁有钱就卖给谁，结果粮食都叫奸商买去了，吃亏的还是农民”。因之，有余粮户继续卖出了余粮。如农民张连增前已卖出余粮一三○○斤，这次经过教育和打增产节约谱后，又卖出余粮二八○斤。不缺粮或缺粮很少的户提出：为了支援国家建设和维持扩大生产，要厉行节约，不买粮食。如农民金世九原计划到银行贷款十五万元买二百斤粮食，现在也不再贷款买粮。他说：“我没有余粮卖给国家，要为国家节约粮食，家家节约，积少成多，社会主义就能早日实现。”缺粮户也纷纷表示：要细水长流省吃俭用，不多买国家的粮食。有的说：“社会主义是一砖一瓦垒起来的，节约一斤粮，国家建设就增加了一分力量。”
    在干部和群众思想觉悟提高的基础上，后屯乡对缺粮户进行了调查工作。在大体了解了缺粮户数、粮数，并培养了典型、树立了正确榜样以后，进行了如下具体工作：一、召开缺粮户会议，会上，进一步宣传统购统销政策，讲明供应的对象、标准和时间。并由积极分子发言，然后由领导方面提出供应名单，民主协商评定供应户，并通过打增产节约谱，由缺粮户自报缺粮时间和实需数量，再民主评定。二、向群众公布供应户名单，进行评议，最后通过。该乡采用了召开村民大会和以选区为单位召开小型会议的两种方式，基本上做到了供应正确，群众满意。三、最后经领导批准，发给购粮证。四、同时，结合统销工作，对十三户长年困难户进行了救济，共发放救济款四十七万元，并帮助他们打出生产自救谱。群众反映良好，有的说：“政府不光保证缺粮实需户的供应，对困难户还进行救济，人民政府真处处关心人民。”
    经上述工作后，最后确定全乡麦收前共供应九二户（四一四人），占总户数的百分之一三点一。其中缺粮一个月的二七户，缺两个月的四一户，缺三个月的二○户，缺四个月的四户。共计划供应粮食和瓜干一三四六○斤，其中粗粮四四八○斤，瓜干八九八○斤（瓜干占总数的百分之六六）。平均每户一四六斤。群众对这次粮食供应工作都很满意。普遍反映：“只有正确地实行计划供应才能把粮食用到真正需要的地方，这样办就对了。”已卖出余粮的农民说：“统购统销的办法真好，有余粮的卖粮后扩大了生产，缺粮户买到实需的粮食，生产也有了保证。”缺粮的农民说：“有了统购统销政策，今后再也不受粮商粮贩和高利贷的剥削了，好好安心生产吧！”因而通过统销工作，进一步推动了生产、互助合作与统购工作。现全乡耙地已形成运动，互助合作组织也通过订增产节约计划有了进一步的提高。
