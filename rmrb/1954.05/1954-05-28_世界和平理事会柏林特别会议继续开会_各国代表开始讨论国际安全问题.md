Xinhua News Agency report: The World Peace Council's Berlin Special Session continued its discussion of Pritt's report at the afternoon session on May 25th. Leopold Infeld served as chairman.

Professor Lota Radaceanu (Romania) spoke. He said that the Romanian people are particularly concerned about the issue of European security, upon which their own security depends. He explained that cooperation between Eastern and Western Europe is not only possible, but also necessary for the people of Europe.

Argentine doctor Camarota said: We doctors have always been interested in eradicating bacteria. Therefore, the great discoveries in the field of bacteriology are themselves a well-deserved glory of bacteriological science. However, in some countries, these scientific achievements have been used for military purposes of aggression in the past few years, rather than for the benefit of mankind. He said: We should tell the people of all countries about the serious dangers of atomic and bacteriological warfare, and call on them to fight for the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction.

Soviet writer Nikolai Tikhonov spoke. He first pointed out that the efforts of millions of peace fighters have led to a certain degree of easing of international tensions. He then emphasized that, despite these achievements, the Vietnam War still has the potential to expand further. This is because the advocates of the so-called "position of strength" policy are unwilling to give up their position and continue to intimidate the people of the world.

Tikhonov said that the hydrogen bomb explosion on Bikini Island was the culmination of years of atomic provocation. He said that voices have been raised from all sides demanding the rapid and complete prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. The scope of this protest movement is very broad, and there has never been such unity on the issue of prohibiting weapons of mass destruction as there is today.

Tikhonov said that the Soviet Union has always insisted on the complete prohibition of atomic, bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet Union demands that atomic energy be used for the peaceful needs of mankind, and advocates the establishment of strict and gradual international supervision, so that it is impossible for one side or another to conceal the production and existing stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said: The international supervision we advocate requires not only that the production facilities and stockpiles of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and raw materials that governments have already declared be investigated, but also that the international supervisory body has the right to investigate if there is suspicion that a country is concealing production facilities and stockpiles.

Tikhonov said that during the Second World War, no government dared to openly use chemical or bacteriological weapons. He said that if signing the Geneva Protocol has yielded positive results, then prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons will certainly achieve the same results.

At the same time, we must unswervingly strive for substantial reductions in all conventional weapons and troops.

Tikhonov finally said that if an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is concluded, and strict international supervision is established to ensure the implementation of the agreement, it would greatly contribute to easing international tensions and consolidating peace among the people of all countries.

Italian Senator Emilio Sereni spoke. He pointed out that the current task is to establish all possible contacts to unite all forces striving for peace, preventing the threat of atomic war, striving for peaceful solutions to international problems, and defending civilization.

French writer Jean-Paul Sartre said in his speech that the unification of Germany must be realized. The sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam must be recognized. The People's Republic of China must be recognized. He said that the people of all countries must unite in the struggle against the atomic bomb and achieve peace.

Also speaking at the afternoon meeting were Ferenc Boros, General Secretary of the International Federation of Chemical and Allied Workers' Unions, and Thomas Kristiansson of Denmark.

Xinhua News Agency report: The World Peace Council's Berlin Special Session continued its discussion of Pritt's report at the morning session on May 26th. Pritt served as chairman of the meeting.

Reverend Bliss (UK) spoke. He said that the British people are prepared to sign petitions calling on the British government to take the initiative in proposing a meeting of the great powers to discuss the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, as well as ways and means to ease international tensions.

Lázaro Peña, General Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, exposed the United States' aggressive policies in Central and South American countries.

The speech by French representative Dastier de la Vigerie introduced the discussion of the second item on the agenda, "International Security Issues." He emphasized the significance of the peace movement and talked about the current international situation. He said that peace must be restored in Korea, and the independence and unification of the Korean people must be restored; the war in Indochina must be stopped, and the sovereignty of the Indochinese countries and the right of the people of these countries to determine their own destiny must be restored; the unification of Germany must be restored, its borders determined, and it must no longer be allowed to become a source of future unrest in Europe.

He emphasized the significance of Molotov's proposal for European collective security made in Berlin in February, and the recent proposals by Zhou Enlai and Nehru for Asian collective security. He said that one of the main tasks of the World Peace Council is to demand that the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference continue to be held, and that the governments concerned resume the interrupted negotiations.

When De la Vigerie spoke about the peace movement's attitude towards the Geneva Conference, he cited the resolution passed by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in March: "The Geneva Conference may and must be an important step towards easing international tensions and disarmament." He said that public opinion should strongly condemn the conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference, and condemn the talks that France and the United States have begun outside the conference, aimed at military intervention in Indochina by the United States.

De la Vigerie finally pointed out that the influence of the World Peace Council has greatly increased, and it has promoted the unity of peace forces among those who are far from this movement.

Next, Josef Hromádka (Czechoslovakia) spoke. He said that fighting for collective security is not only a struggle against the danger of war, but also a struggle against the attempts by those imperialist blocs to put together new aggressive blocs.

Indian writer Pandit Sundarlal spoke, saying that the government of the People's Republic of China should be recognized as the legitimate government of China, and it should obtain its due position in the United Nations.

He supported these demands: the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, giving the Korean people the possibility to determine their own destiny and elect their own government, and the immediate cessation of the war in Indochina.

Sundarlal finally said that India will never fight against China or the Soviet Union; not war, but only peaceful negotiation can solve disputed issues and establish world peace.

Also speaking at the meeting were Canadian journalist Mickleborough and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Chairman of the Polish Peace Defense Committee and writer.

Finally, Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, spoke.

The morning meeting adjourned after Guo Moruo's speech.

    世界和平理事会柏林特别会议继续开会
    各国代表开始讨论国际安全问题
    据新华社讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议五月二十五日的下午会议继续讨论普里特的报告。由利奥波德·英费尔德担任主席。
    洛塔·拉达齐亚努教授（罗马尼亚）发言。他说，罗马尼亚人民特别关心自己的安全所依靠的欧洲安全的问题。他说明了东西欧合作不仅是可能的，而且对于欧洲人民说来是必要的。
    阿根廷医生卡马罗塔说：我们医生一向对于扑灭细菌问题感到兴趣。因此，在细菌方面的各种伟大发现的本身，就是细菌科学当之而无愧的光荣。但在某些国家内，这种科学的成就在过去几年内被用来达到侵略的军事目的，而不是用来为人类谋福利。他说：我们应该告诉各国人民关于原子战与细菌战的严重危险，并号召他们为禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器而斗争。
    苏联作家吉洪诺夫发言。他首先指出，千百万和平战士努力的结果，已使国际紧张局势得到一定程度的缓和。他接着强调指出，虽然有了这些成就，越南战争仍有进一步扩大的可能。因为所谓“实力地位”政策的鼓吹者们，绝不愿意放弃他们的地位，而要继续恫吓全世界的人民。
    吉洪诺夫说，比基尼岛爆炸氢弹是多年来原子挑衅的顶点。他说，各方面发出了要求迅速和完全禁止大规模毁灭性武器的呼声。这一抗议运动包括的范围非常广泛，在禁止大规模毁灭性武器的问题上，从来没有像今天这样的团结一致。
    吉洪诺夫说，苏联一直坚持完全禁止原子、细菌、化学与其他大规模毁灭性的武器，苏联要求使原子能服务于人类的和平需要，主张建立严格的和逐步的国际监督，使得一方或另一方不可能隐瞒原子武器与氢武器的生产情况与现有的原子武器和氢武器的储存量。他说：我们所主张的国际监督是：不仅要求各国政府所已经宣布的生产设备及原子弹、氢弹和原料的储存量受到调查，而且要求，假设有人怀疑某国隐瞒生产设备和储存量，国际监督机构有权对此进行调查。
    吉洪诺夫说，在第二次世界大战过程中，没有一个政府敢于公开使用化学武器或细菌武器。他说，如果说签订日内瓦议定书得到了积极的结果，那末禁止原子武器和氢武器当然也将得到同样的效果。
    同时，必须坚持不渝地争取大量裁减一切常规武器与军队。
    吉洪诺夫最后说，如果缔结了关于禁止原子武器、氢武器与其他大规模毁灭性武器的协定，同时建立严格的国际监督以保证协定的履行，那就会大大地有助于缓和国际紧张局势与巩固各国人民间的和平。
    意大利参议员埃米略·塞伦尼发言。他指出目前的任务是建立各种可能的联系，把一切为争取和平，防止原子战争威胁，争取和平解决国际问题和保卫文明而努力的力量团结起来。
    法国作家让·保罗·萨特在发言中说，德国的统一必须实现。越南民主共和国的主权必须得到承认。中华人民共和国必须得到承认。他说，各国人民必须在反对原子弹的斗争中团结起来并实现和平。
    在下午会议上发言的还有化学及有关工业工人工会国际总书记费伦茨·波若基和丹麦的托马斯·克里斯坦逊。
    据新华社讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议二十六日上午会议继续讨论普里特的报告，会议由普里特担任主席。
    布利斯牧师（英国）发言。他说，英国人民准备在要求英国政府主动提议召开大国会议来讨论禁止大规模毁灭性武器，以及讨论缓和国际紧张局势的途径与方法的请愿书上签名。
    古巴工人联合会总书记拉萨罗·培尼亚揭露了美国在中美、南美国家的侵略政策。
    法国代表达斯迪埃·德拉维热里的发言引入了第二项议程“国际安全问题”的讨论。他着重指出了和平运动的意义，并谈到目前的国际局势。他说，必须恢复朝鲜的和平，恢复朝鲜人民的独立和统一；必须停止印度支那战争，恢复印度支那各国的主权和这些国家的人民自行决定自己命运的权利；必须恢复德国的统一，确定它的国界和不再让它成为未来的欧洲不安的因素。
    他着重指出莫洛托夫二月在柏林提出的欧洲集体安全的建议，最近周恩来和尼赫鲁提出的关于亚洲集体安全的建议的意义。他说，世界和平理事会的主要任务之一，就是要求柏林外长会议继续举行，有关政府恢复中断了的商谈。
    德拉维热里讲到和平运动对日内瓦会议的态度时，援引了世界和平理事会常务委员会三月通过的决议：“日内瓦会议可能是也必须是走向缓和国际紧张局势和裁减军备的一个重要步骤。”他说，舆论应当严厉谴责破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋，谴责法、美两国在会外开始进行的、目的在于使美国对印度支那进行军事干涉的会谈。
    德拉维热里最后指出，世界和平理事会的影响大大地增加了，它促使那些远离这种运动的人们中间的和平力量团结起来。
    接着约瑟夫·赫鲁玛德卡（捷克斯洛伐克）发言。他说，为集体安全而斗争，这不只是反对战争危险的斗争，也是反对那些帝国主义集团企图拼凑新的侵略集团的斗争。
    印度作家潘迪特·森德拉尔发言说，应当承认中华人民共和国政府是中国合法的政府，它应在联合国中获得应有的位置。
    他支持这些要求：撤退朝鲜境内的所有外国军队，给予朝鲜人民以自己决定自己命运和选举自己政府的可能，立即停止印度支那战火。
    森德拉尔最后说，印度绝不对中国或是苏联作战，不是战争，而只有和平协商才能使争论的问题获得解决，才能建立世界和平。
    在会上发言的还有加拿大新闻记者密克尔堡和波兰保卫和平委员会主席、作家雅罗斯瓦夫·伊瓦希凯维奇。
    最后由世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若发言。
    上午会议在郭沫若发言后即告休会。
