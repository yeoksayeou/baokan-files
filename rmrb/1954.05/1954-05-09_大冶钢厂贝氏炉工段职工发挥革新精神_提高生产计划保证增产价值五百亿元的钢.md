(Dispatch from Wuhan, May 8th) The workers of the Bessemer shop at Daye Steel Plant have been implementing the spirit of technical innovation, guaranteeing to overfulfill the original annual state plan by 143% this year, increasing the value of steel production for the country by more than 50 billion yuan.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, the workers of the Bessemer shop have actively explored the enormous potential of production equipment. At the beginning of this year, they carried out five major technical improvements, creating conditions for implementing the Soviet advanced experience of "low-silicon blowing," shortening the blowing time and production downtime per furnace by more than seven minutes. As a result, a pair of small Bessemer furnaces achieved a new record of an average of 103 furnaces per day in April, 35% higher than the highest monthly average in the past (December) of 77 furnaces per day. In May, they continued to propose six technical innovation plans to reduce physical labor, improve high-temperature working conditions, and further realize "low-silicon blowing" to increase production. On the 8th, all the workers in the shop proactively increased the annual state plan by 28%, and at the same time, they set a "striving plan" that was 12% higher than the revised state plan, totaling 43% higher than the original state plan.

The original production equipment of Daye Steel Plant was unbalanced, with a small steelmaking capacity and a large processing capacity. In addition, this year it was necessary to produce a large number of steel ingots to support fraternal steel plants, which further increased the difficulties. There were frequent shutdowns and material shortages in the processing workshops. The increased production in the Bessemer shop has initially solved this difficulty. The steel ingots they produce, when made into steel, are enough to build forty-six five-story buildings with 10,000 square meters each, all reinforced concrete. The increased molten steel they produce can supply electric furnaces with 9,700 tons of high-quality steel.

    大冶钢厂贝氏炉工段职工发挥革新精神
    提高生产计划保证增产价值五百亿元的钢
    【本报武汉八日电】大冶钢厂贝氏炉工段职工贯彻技术革新精神，保证今年超额完成原有全年国家计划百分之一百四十三，为国家增产价值五百多亿元的钢。
    贝氏炉工段职工，从去年第四季起就积极发掘出生产设备的巨大潜力，并在今年年初先后进行了五项重大的技术改进，为实行苏联先进经验“低矽吹炼”创造了条件，使每炉吹炼时间与生产间断时间缩短了七分多钟。一对小型贝氏炉因此在四月份达到平均日炼一百零三炉的新纪录，比去年最高月份（十二月）平均日炼七十七炉，高百分之三十五。他们又在五月份继续提出六项技术革新计划，减轻体力劳动，改善高温作业条件，并进一步实现“低矽吹炼”，提高生产。全段职工在八日主动提高了全年国家计划百分之二十八，同时订出“争取计划”，比修改后的国家计划又提高了百分之十二，总计比原有国家计划提高百分之四十三。
    大冶钢厂原有生产设备不平衡，炼钢能力小，加工能力大，加以今年又要生产大批钢锭支援兄弟钢厂，就更加增加了困难，加工车间时有停工待料现象发生。贝氏炉工段的增产便初步解决了这个困难。他们增产的钢锭在制成钢材后，足够修建全部钢筋混凝土的每栋一万平方公尺的五层大楼四十六栋。他们增产的钢水，可供电炉生产九千七百吨优质钢。
