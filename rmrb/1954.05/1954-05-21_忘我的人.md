    Selfless Person
    ——Remembering Qi Qingquan, a meritorious representative of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps, invited to attend the Third Celebration Conference of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
  　Xing Jitang

    "Oh my! Such a big project, I've never seen anything like it. Look! What the enemy has done to it!" Comrade Qi Qingquan thought as he looked at the Qingchuan River Bridge, which had been destroyed by American planes.
    The Qingchuan River is in North Korea. The steel plates and iron beams of the bridge over the river, some fallen into the water, some bent towards the sky, some twisted into a ball, were truly infuriating to see. The Korean War had been fought for three years, and this bridge had been bombed by American planes for three years. After the Korean armistice, a certain unit of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army undertook the task of repairing the large iron bridge.
    This was a huge project, and Comrade Qi Qingquan had indeed never seen anything like it. He was the leader of a gas welding team, and in the repair project, the gas welders were very important. Many of the destroyed parts had to be cut off with a gas cutting torch, then transported away, and then new bridge beams had to be installed. Although they were called a team, only Qi Qingquan and Zhao Xianyao could actually use the gas cutting torch, and their skills were not very high. Qi Qingquan, for example, had only been studying for less than two months! When accepting the work assignment, Qi Qingquan thought to himself: "Such a big project, can it be completed in three months? I'm not even skilled at working on the ground, how can I work on an iron bridge dozens of meters high?" He was indeed a little embarrassed. But then he thought: "As long as I study diligently and am not afraid of hardship, there will be no problem." He felt that he was a Communist Party member, and a Communist Party member has no difficulties that cannot be overcome.
    The huge repair project began. The higher-ups required the gas welding team to cut off eight pieces a day, but Qi Qingquan worked for a whole day, until nine o'clock in the evening, and only cut off one piece, which made him very uneasy. When he returned to the team in the evening, the soldiers were also very anxious. Everyone surrounded him and asked, "Team leader, what should we do?" In front of his comrades, he had to say, "It's okay, we'll figure out a way together." to encourage the comrades' morale. In fact, he was more anxious than anyone else, and didn't sleep well all night.
    The next day, he got up before dawn and ran to the construction site. He looked at the destroyed iron bridge, and was both angry and anxious. The company commander saw through his worries and comforted him, saying, "Worrying is useless, we'll study it together. Using our brains will find a solution." Sometimes the company commander would personally help him.
      "Using our brains will find a solution." Qi Qingquan knew that it was no use relying on brute force. He worked, watched, and slowly found the trick. He carefully studied where it would be easier to cut off, and started from there. Every time he cut off a piece, he would first study it. As a result, he cut off eight pieces that day, meeting the requirements.
    In the winter of North Korea, snowflakes were constantly falling, and the bridge was often covered with a layer of ice and snow. Working on it was much more difficult than on the ground, and there was no way to wear goggles or gloves. Sometimes he had to drill into the iron plate holes to cut off; sometimes he had to be tied with a rope and cut upside down; sometimes he had to hold onto the iron frame with one hand and hold the cutting torch with the other, using his teeth to open the switch. The gas melted the steel, and sparks flew everywhere, sometimes burning blisters on his hands and feet, and holes in his cotton clothes. But Qi Qingquan didn't care about these things. As long as he could complete the work assignment, he was not afraid of anything. He had only one thought in his mind: "For the sake of peace, the martyrs Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun gave their lives; for the sake of restoring North Korea's construction, what does a little suffering matter?" This was the source of his strength.
    Cutting off was the first step. In many places, the second step could not be carried out without cutting off first. Qi Qingquan contacted each work unit every day, divided the work into urgent and less urgent, and arranged the order. Sometimes he would take advantage of other people's meal times to work; sometimes he would wait for other units to finish work before carrying out the cutting off work. This way, others could start working as soon as they arrived, without being delayed due to untimely cutting off. Many comrades often said, "Without Team Leader Qi's efforts, we would not be able to improve our work efficiency."
    More than ten days after the start of work, the company found that Qi Qingquan was returning very late every day. The company commander asked him what time he came back every day. He said that he came back as soon as he finished work. The company commander immediately asked, "Why do you go to the kitchen to eat cold food every day?" Qi Qingquan had no choice but to tell the truth. The company commander did not criticize him for not being punctual, because the company commander knew that Qi Qingquan had asked several times, saying that there were too few people and hoping not to limit his working hours. However, in order to take care of the comrades' health, the higher-ups could not agree to this. But now Qi Qingquan was actually doing it this way, because if he didn't do this, the entire repair project could not be completed. There was nothing wrong with his selfless work; therefore, the company commander only repeatedly told him to pay attention to protecting his health, and often helped the gas welders.
    "Pay attention to protecting your health," Qi Qingquan understood, but the determination to complete the task made him unable to care about many things. The blisters on his hands and feet, the old ones had just healed and the new ones appeared again. His cotton clothes were so burned that he couldn't wear them anymore, and the higher-ups issued him another set. He wore three sets of cotton clothes in less than two months. Once, a small spark hit his eye, causing a white blister to form on his eyeball. The medic applied medicine to it and covered it with gauze, and he continued to work with one eye. The strong white light stimulated his eyes so much that he couldn't see clearly in the evenings. However, none of these things ever affected his completion of the work. The company commander often said, "Qi Qingquan is an iron man." That's true, as long as he had work, he would forget everything. Once, he had malaria, but he still insisted on working. After work, he and a soldier carried an oxygen tank back. He felt very tired and his whole body ached, as if he couldn't lift it. On the way, he met a comrade who said that a certain place was waiting to be cut off. As soon as he heard that there was work waiting to be done, his spirits immediately lifted, and he felt full of energy, and carried the oxygen tank and ran off.
    From the first day of work, Qi Qingquan was both completing the most difficult work and training the comrades in the team. He knew that relying on one person alone could not accomplish much. He first found three comrades who learned quickly and taught them with emphasis. He used meal and sleep times to explain how to use the cutting torch, how to prevent danger, and what high and low pressure were. He also lectured while working during the day, until the comrades thoroughly understood. Sometimes, when he encountered simple work, he would let the students do it and teach them by hand. In this way, the three comrades quickly mastered the technique. Then he adopted the method of apprentices teaching apprentices, letting the learned comrades teach others. Every night, after receiving the work assignment, he specifically divided the whole team into several groups, designating who should teach whom. During the day, whenever he had time, he would go to each group to check and guide. In this way, in just over a month, the gas welding team grew from one working group to six working groups. All the comrades in the team could complete general work assignments.
    Since the beginning of the repair of the Qingchuan River Bridge, Qi Qingquan has always been completing the most difficult work while leading and training the entire team. The entire project was planned to be completed in three months, but it was completed in only seventy-odd days, fourteen days ahead of schedule. This is inseparable from Qi Qingquan's active study and selfless work.
    On the day of the opening ceremony, the banks of the Qingchuan River were filled with Korean and Chinese troops and Korean people. Qi Qingquan and other meritorious contributors to the repair project boarded the train and steadily passed over the river bridge. Qi Qingquan looked at the cheering people on both sides of the river, at the Qingchuan River, and at the big iron bridge they had repaired with their own hands, and felt indescribably happy.

    忘我的人
    ——记应邀参加中国人民解放军铁道兵第三届庆功大会的志愿军铁道兵功臣代表齐清泉
  　邢纪棠
    “哎呀！这么大的工程，我见都没见过。看！被敌人炸成了什么样子！”齐清泉同志看着被美国飞机炸毁的清川江大铁桥，心里这样想。
    清川江在北朝鲜。江上的大铁桥的钢板铁梁，落到水里的，弯上天空的，扭成一团的，看看真令人气愤。朝鲜战争打了三年，这座桥梁就被美国飞机炸了三年。朝鲜停战了，中国人民志愿军铁道兵某部，担任了修复大铁桥的任务。
    这是一个巨大的工程，齐清泉同志的确没有见过。他是瓦斯工班班长，在修复工程当中，瓦斯工是很重要的。炸毁的许多部分，要先用瓦斯切断器切断，再运走，然后装上新桥梁。说起来他们是一个班，但实际可以使用瓦斯切断器的只有齐清泉和赵显耀两个人，并且技术还不高，就拿齐清泉来说，才学习了不到两个月呢！接受工作任务的时候，齐清泉心里想：“这么大的工程，三个月能完成吗？自己在平地上干的还不熟练，现在要在几十公尺高的铁桥上干，干得了吗！”他心里确实有些为难。但是他又想：“只要虚心研究，不怕吃苦，就没有问题。”他觉得自己是共产党员，共产党员没有克服不了的困难。
    巨大的修复工程开始了。上级要求瓦斯工班每天切下八件，但是齐清泉干了一天，一直干到晚上九点，才切下了一件，这使他心里十分不安。晚上回去以后，班里战士也很着急，大家围着他问：“班长，怎么办？”在同志们面前他只好说：“没关系，我们大家想办法。”来鼓励同志们的情绪。其实他心里比谁都急，一宿也没睡好。
    第二天，天不亮他就起来跑上了工地。他看着炸毁的大铁桥，又生气又着急。连长看透了他的心事，便安慰他说：“着急没有用，我们共同来研究。开动脑筋就有办法。”有时连长亲自动手帮他干。
      “开动脑筋就有办法”。齐清泉知道光靠蛮干是不行的。他干着，看着，慢慢地就找到窍门了。他仔细地研究着在什么地方切断省事，就从什么地方下手。每切断一件，他都首先研究一番。结果，这一天切下八件，达到了要求。
    北朝鲜的冬天，雪花不断地飘着，铁桥架上经常结着一层冰雪。在那上面干活，比平地上要艰难得多，又没法戴镜子和手套。有时要钻到铁板空里去切断；有时要用绳子拴着，头朝下倒着开火；有时要一只手攀着铁架子，只用一只手拿着切断器，用牙齿咬开开关。瓦斯融化了钢铁，火花四溅，有时把手脚烧起了泡，棉衣烧上了窟窿。但是齐清泉并没在乎这些。只要能完成工作任务，他什么也不怕。他心里只有一个想法：“为了和平，黄继光和邱少云烈士，献出了自己的生命；为了恢复朝鲜的建设，吃点苦又算了什么呢？”这就是他的力量的源泉。
    切断是第一步工序。许多地方，不先切断便不能进行第二步工作。齐清泉每天都是和各工作单位联系好，分出缓急，排定次序。有时是在别人吃饭的时候，他瞅空干；有时等别的单位收工了他再进行切断工作。这样别人一上工就可以干活，不致因切断不及时而停了工。许多同志常说：“没有齐班长的努力，我们就提高不了工作效率。”
    开工十几天以后，连里发现齐清泉每天回去都很晚。连长便问他每天回来的时间，他说收工就回来；连长立刻又问道：“为什么你每天到伙房去吃冷饭？”齐清泉只好说了实话。连长没有批评他不遵守时间，因为连长知道，齐清泉要求过几次啦，说人手太少，希望不要限制他的工作时间。可是为了照顾同志们的健康，上级不能答应他们这样做。但是现在齐清泉实际是这样作了，因为不这样干，整个修复工程就不能完成任务，他这样忘我的工作，是没有什么错误的；因此，连长只是再三嘱咐他，要注意爱护自己的身体，并在许多时候，动手帮助瓦斯工干活。
    “注意爱护身体”，齐清泉是懂得的，但完成任务的决心，使他顾不了许多。他手脚上的血泡，旧的刚好新的又起来了。棉衣烧得不能穿了，上级再发一件给他。不到两个月他穿了三套棉衣。有一次小火星崩到眼上，把眼球烧起了一个白泡，卫生员给他上了药，盖上纱布，他用一只眼睛，照样工作。强烈的白光，刺激得眼睛一到晚上便看不清楚。但是，所有这些，从来没影响他完成工作。连长常说：“齐清泉是铁人。”真是这样，只要有了工作他会忘掉一切。有一次他发了疟疾，还坚持工作，收工后他和一个战士抬着氧气桶往回走，他觉得很疲乏，混身发酸，好像抬不动了。半路上遇到一个同志说某地等着切断，他一听说有工作等着干，精神马上来了，浑身都有了劲，抬着氧气桶就跑去了。
    从开工的第一天起，齐清泉便一面干活一面培养班里的同志。他知道，光靠一个人是干不出多少活的。他首先找了学得快的三个同志，有重点地教。他利用吃饭和睡觉的时间，讲解怎样使用切断器，怎样防止危险，什么是高压低压。白天也一边干活一边讲，直到同志们彻底了解为止。有时候遇到简单的活，他就让学的同志动手，并且把着手教。这样那三个同志便很快地掌握了技术。接着他又采取徒弟教徒弟的办法，让学会的同志再教给别人。每天晚上接受了工作任务以后，他具体地把全班划分几个小组，指定谁教给谁。白天一有空，他就到每个小组去检查和指导。就这样一个多月的时间，瓦斯工班从原来一个小组干活发展到六个小组。全班同志都可以完成一般的工作任务了。
    自开始修复清川江大桥以来，齐清泉始终是一面完成着最艰难的工作，一面领导和培养着全班。整个工程计划是三个月完成，结果只用了七十几天，提前了十四天完成任务。这与积极钻研、忘我工作的齐清泉是分不开的。
    举行通车典礼那天，清川江两岸站满了朝中部队和朝鲜人民，齐清泉和其他参加修复工程的功臣，坐上火车，稳稳地通过了江桥。齐清泉看着两岸欢呼的人们，看着清川江水，看着他们亲手修复的大铁桥，心里说不出的高兴。
