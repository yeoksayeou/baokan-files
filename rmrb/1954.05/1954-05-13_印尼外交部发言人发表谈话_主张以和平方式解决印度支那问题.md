    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 12th: The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated to the press on the 11th that the liberation of Dien Bien Phu is a significant event that cannot be ignored. He hopes that people will intensify their efforts to achieve a ceasefire and resolve the Indochina issue peacefully through negotiations.

    He believes that the primary condition for resolving the Indochina issue is the abolition of the colonial system, allowing the Vietnamese people to make their own decisions. He said that as long as France insists on its status as a colonial power in Indochina, this issue cannot be resolved.

    He said that the proposal put forward by Bidault at the Geneva Conference is unacceptable.

    The spokesperson said that if a ceasefire is achieved, it would be best to resolve the Indochina issue without French interference. The people of Indochina themselves have the final say. French colonialists should leave Indochina and transfer sovereignty to the people of Indochina.

    印尼外交部发言人发表谈话
    主张以和平方式解决印度支那问题
    【新华社雅加达十二日电】印度尼西亚外交部发言人十一日向报界发表谈话称，奠边府的解放是一个不可忽视的重大事件。他希望人民加紧努力争取停火，并通过谈判以和平方式解决印度支那问题。
    他认为解决印度支那问题的首要条件是废除殖民制度，让越南人民自己作主。他说，只要法国还坚持它在印度支那的殖民国家的地位，这个问题就不能得到解决。
    他说，皮杜尔在日内瓦会议上提出的建议是不可能被接受的。
    该发言人说，假如停火实现，最好在没有法国干涉的情况下来解决印度支那问题。印度支那人民自己有最后决定权。法国殖民者应离开印度支那，并把主权移交给印度支那人民。
