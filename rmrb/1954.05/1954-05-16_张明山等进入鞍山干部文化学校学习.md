　　Anshan’s well-known labor models Zhang Mingshan, Wang Jinzhong, and 32 others, along with more than 450 factory directors, Party committee secretaries, union chairmen, and section and division-level cadres from some factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, have begun studying at the newly established Anshan Cadre Cultural School. Many of these students have undergone years of revolutionary training and have rich experience in revolutionary struggle and practical production knowledge. After entering the cultural school, they will spend two to three years raising their knowledge of subjects such as Chinese language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry to the level of junior high school graduation or the second year of senior high school, preparing for further studies. They are all in high spirits after entering the school. Zhang Mingshan, who had just returned from Beijing after attending the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technical Innovation Exhibition," rushed to the school as soon as he arrived in Anshan. He said: "I have been troubled by my low level of education at work. This time, I will improve my cultural level." Yan Ming, the director of a small rolling mill, had repeatedly requested to study and was also approved to enter the cadre cultural school this time.

    张明山等进入鞍山干部文化学校学习
    鞍山著名劳动模范张明山、王进忠等三十四人，和鞍山钢铁公司的一部分工厂的厂长、党委书记、工会主席和处、科级干部等四百五十多人，开始在新成立的鞍山市干部文化学校学习。这些学员有许多曾经过多年革命锻炼，有丰富的革命斗争经验和实际生产知识。他们进入文化学校后，将以二年到三年的时间把语文、数学、物理、化学等课程提高到初中毕业或高中二年级程度，准备继续深造。他们入学后，学习情绪都很高，刚从北京参加
  “鞍钢技术革新展览会”归来的张明山，一到鞍山就赶到学校里去。他说：在工作中因为文化低很苦恼，这次要好好把文化提高一步。小型轧钢厂的厂长燕鸣曾多次要求学习，这次也被批准进入了干部文化学校。　　　（新华社）
