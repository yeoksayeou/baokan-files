    Technical Innovation Movement at Factory 401
    Meng Lang
    Three Key Problems
    Factory 401 is a factory that was heavily looted and destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, all employees of the factory worked hard to overcome various difficulties. Although they had successfully resumed work and were able to produce in large quantities, there were still three key problems that had not been resolved.
    These three key problems are: first, the product quality is low, mainly due to the high impurity content of the products; second, the furnace body has a short life, distillation tanks often leak, and stopping the furnace for repairs affects production and causes excessive costs; third, the labor conditions are poor, with many high-temperature, mineral dust, and heavy physical labor processes, which harm workers' health and affect the improvement of labor productivity.
    The experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill in carrying out the mechanization movement pointed out the direction for transforming old factories and mines, and also provided Factory 401 with a valuable key to solving the three key problems. Zhao Qing, the deputy director of production at Factory 401, visited the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill. After returning to the factory, he began to mobilize engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers to engage in the technical innovation movement.
      Removing a Major Worry
    One of the products of Factory 401 is finished primary ore. After the ore comes out of the furnace, it is as hot as 600 degrees Celsius and is discharged into iron carts, which are pushed manually to the ore storage room for screening. It was already dangerous enough to manually push hot ore, but it was even more unbearable to manually shovel it through a sieve. The ore storage room was almost a closed room, with only a few small windows for heat dissipation, because opening large windows would cause the ore to fly away. The roof of the ore storage room was lit by electric lights. When screening hot ore, the room was filled with flying mineral dust, making it impossible to see people across the room, and the electric lights on the roof were also obscured by the mineral dust. Even if the workers wore half-inch-thick masks, they could not prevent the mineral dust from entering their mouths; even if they wore long rubber boots, they could not prevent the hot ore from scorching the hair on their legs. After the workers screened a cart of hot ore, they would feel dizzy and sweaty, and they had to immediately run out and lie on the stone slabs in the yard to recover. Such harsh labor conditions were unbearable for the workers, that's one; the hot ore had to cool for half a month before it could be packaged, and the finished ore was backlogged and could not be loaded onto trucks, resulting in more than 3 billion yuan of capital being tied up each month, that's two; because the finished ore could not be transported out, it affected the production of brother factories, that's three; the backlog of ore caused the ore storage room to be unable to store it, which affected the large-scale production of the roasting furnace, and even threatened to force a shutdown, that's four. These four major harms had not been resolved for many years, and they became a major worry for the factory.
    From December 1952, Comrade Wu Zhenhua, a mechanical technician, had been trying to develop an "electromagnetic vibrating screen" to solve the mechanization problem of hot ore cooling, transportation, and screening. After more than seven months of rework, using 200 million yuan of labor and materials, he still had not succeeded. After the factory launched the technical innovation movement in June 1953, with the help of veteran workers and technicians in the mechanical department, he spent another month and finally succeeded in manufacturing the "automatic cooling ore conveyor." From then on, hot ore no longer had to be pushed or screened manually, and especially, it was no longer backlogged. Through the "automatic cooling ore conveyor," the hot ore discharged from the closed furnace was quickly automatically cooled, screened, and transported to the ore storage hopper via a belt conveyor. After weighing, it could be bagged and transported out. The labor of twenty-four people day and night pushing, screening, and turning the ore (to cool it) was saved, and now only one worker is needed to sit next to the "automatic cooling ore conveyor" to take care of the machine. A major worry of the factory was removed. The workers who pushed, screened, and turned the ore felt that they could live ten more years to participate in national construction.
    The Technical Innovation Movement Fully Begins
    After the successful manufacture of the automatic cooling ore conveyor, brother workshops and brother factories and mines sent people to visit, and the technical innovation movement at Factory 401 was carried out more comprehensively. The workers in the roasting workshop installed light railways from the ore shed to the charging port, using small iron carts to transport ore instead of carrying ore on their shoulders, and the workers happily called it the "direct express"; a small winch was installed on the highest floor of the workshop, replacing the manual labor of carrying mineral dust up the iron ladder, floor by floor; an automatic grinding machine was installed, replacing the manual labor of pushing stone rollers to crush lumpy ore; and flat-mouthed pipes were manufactured, using compressed air to remove the ore sticking to the furnace arms and furnace teeth inside the furnace, replacing the arduous physical labor of opening the furnace door and using flat shovels, iron chisels, and other tools to sweep the furnace. Therefore, the furnace sweeping time was greatly shortened, the furnace temperature was stabilized, and the quality of the products was guaranteed, increasing the efficiency by twelve times compared to manual furnace sweeping in the past. In just two or three months, the technical innovation movement completely changed the face of the roasting workshop. Other workshops have also successively adopted 25 suggestions such as automatic batching, automatic analysis, automatic low-temperature cleaning, and automatic recording. Even on the coal hopper of the gas generator, the material staff also created a small meter for automatic measurement of coal addition. Small apprentices in the repair shop also learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and manufactured a "toothless saw" to replace manual hand sawing of steel pipes and steel rods, increasing efficiency by 45 times. Although the value of each creation cannot be calculated in terms of money, the achievement is considerable, judging from the fact that the labor productivity in the third quarter of 1953 increased by 26.6 percent compared to the second quarter.
    Two More Key Problems Breakthrough
    Although Factory 401 started the technical innovation movement in the second half of 1953, it actually only made a splash in the third quarter, and then became silent in the fourth quarter. This year, in February, production declined sharply, and the plan could not be completed. The factory leaders then relaunched the technical innovation movement. In March, a factory-wide production representative meeting and a meeting of advanced producers and rationalization proposal activists were held. Key tasks were announced, calling on all employees to learn from Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, vigorously propose rationalization suggestions, reverse the current abnormal production situation, and assign important engineering and technical personnel from the production technology section to workshops and go deep into work sections to solve technical problems according to their professional division of labor. The organizational system for rationalization proposals and the promotion of advanced experience throughout the factory was further improved (it was clarified that the main responsibility lies with the heads of each level). Therefore, the innovation movement entered a new climax. In March, a total of 201 rationalization suggestions were made, including nine major technical innovation suggestions. After implementation, the production situation in March greatly improved, not only completely reversing the downward trend in production and overfulfilling the plan, but also making up for the losses in February, ensuring that all products overfulfilled the plan for the first quarter (especially the profit delivered to the state completed 200 percent).
    Among these nine major technical innovations, the most prominent is the innovation in the technical operation of the gas generator. The gas generator is the source of high-temperature heat and the basis for stable production in smelting plants. In the past, the gas volume of one gas generator could only supply four distillation furnaces. After this improvement in operation, the same gas generator can supply the gas for eight distillation furnaces, which is equivalent to adding twice the equipment without spending a penny. The technical innovation of the gas generator not only laid the foundation for other technical innovations, but also provided the prerequisite for the factory to expand production. The second is the success of adding coke to the distillation furnace, hot furnace patching, and beam replacement to support hanging ore, which basically broke through the two key problems of high product impurity and "short furnace body life." From the results of the preliminary trial of adding coke to the distillation furnace in March, on March 31, the products of all furnaces reached the quality standard of 99.9 percent. Furnace No. 3 created a new record of reducing lead content to 0.0098 (generally around 0.05). In March, the average product quality accounting for 23.8 percent of the total output reached the standard of 99.9 percent, and the daily furnace output also increased by an average of 12.8 percent compared to February, and the highest record for daily furnace output was created. Due to the success of hot furnace patching, the time of 14 days for stopping the furnace for cold patching, heating up, and preheating in the past can be shortened to 30 or 40 minutes, so that 108 more furnaces can be opened each year; if the furnace body life can be extended to more than three years as a result, 1.4 to 1.5 billion yuan of major repair costs can be saved for each furnace each year. The third is the success of implementing wet ore smelting (abandoning the pit ore and crushed ore processes) and the intermittent furnace grabbing method by work division (shortening the furnace grabbing time by more than 30 percent), which greatly reduced the unknown loss of ore and the escape of sulfur dioxide. If calculated on the basis of increasing the actual recovery rate by 1 percent each year, 1.2 billion yuan can be saved. Of course, the value is not only reflected in the actual recovery rate. For example, the savings in labor, machinery and electricity, fuel, etc., especially the benefits to improving labor conditions and improving quality and stabilizing furnace temperature, are considerable.
    Striving for New Achievements
    In order to consolidate and enrich the achievements of technical innovation and guide the technical innovation movement to a new climax, the employees of Factory 401 further formulated a plan to increase production and save 15 billion yuan for the country on the basis of completing the 1954 national plan. At the same time, three new key problems for the whole factory were proposed: first, comprehensively improve the metal actual recovery rate and reduce metal loss; second, comprehensively improve product quality; third, on the basis of further improving equipment maintenance, maximize equipment utilization and extend equipment life. Recently, engineering and technical personnel have put forward a new major suggestion that on the basis of completing the 15 billion yuan production increase and saving plan, they can increase production and save 32.8 billion yuan for the motherland. All employees of Factory 401 are rejoicing and encouraged, and are striving to achieve new achievements with full confidence.

    技术革新运动在四○一厂
    孟浪
    三大关键问题
    四○一厂是曾被日本侵略者和蒋匪大肆抢劫破坏过的工厂。解放后，全厂职工在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，努力克服种种困难，虽已胜利复工并能大量生产，但仍存在着三大关键问题没有解决。
    这三大关键问题：一是产品质量低，主要是产品含杂质多；二是炉体寿命短，蒸馏罐常漏，停炉补修影响生产，并造成成本过高；三是劳动条件恶劣，高温、矿尘以及笨重体力劳动的过程较多，妨害工人健康，影响劳动生产率的提高。
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂开展机械化运动的经验，给改造旧厂矿指出了方向，也给四○一厂解决三大关键问题送来了一把珍贵的钥匙。四○一厂生产副厂长赵清到鞍钢小型轧钢厂参观了一番，回厂后就开始发动工程技术人员和老工人搞起技术革新运动来了。
      去掉一块大心病
    四○一厂的产品之一——成品一次矿，该矿出炉后，热达六百多度，即排入铁车内，用人工推到储矿室过筛。本来用人工推热矿就够危险的了，再用人工一锹一锹把它过筛，这更使人难以忍受。储矿室几乎是一个密闭的房间，只有几个小窗户散热，因为开大窗户怕矿石飞跑了。储矿室的屋顶有电灯照明，筛热矿时，满屋矿尘飞扬，对面不见人，屋顶上的电灯也被矿尘遮得昏暗无光。工人即使带上半寸厚的口罩，也遮不住矿尘侵入口内；穿着长统的大胶皮靴，也当不住热矿把腿上的汗毛烤焦。工人筛完一车热矿，就弄得头昏脑胀，汗流满身，必须马上跑出来伏在院中石板上，过了好一会才会清醒过来。劳动条件这样恶劣，工人受不了，这是一；热矿要冷半个月才能包装，成品矿积压着不能装车，每月积压资金在三十亿元以上，这是二；由于成品矿运不出去，影响到兄弟厂的生产，这是三；矿石积压造成储矿室储存不下，影响到焙烧炉不能大量生产，甚至有被迫停工的危险，这是四。这四大害处多年没能解决，就成为工厂里的一块大心病。
    从一九五二年十二月起，机械技术员吴振华同志就在试制“电磁振动筛”来解决热矿冷却运输过筛的机械化问题，七个多月的时间，一再返工，用的人工、材料达两亿元，始终没有成功。一九五三年六月，工厂开展技术革新运动以后，他在机械部门的老工人和技术人员的帮助下，又用了一个多月的时间，终于把“冷却矿自动运输机”制造成功了。从此，热矿再不用人力推车，过筛了，尤其是再也不积压了。通过“冷却矿自动运输机”，迅速地把炉内密闭排出的热矿自动冷却、过筛、经过皮带运输机带到储矿斗，过磅后即可装袋运出。过去日夜二十四个推矿、筛矿、翻矿（使其冷却）的劳动力省掉了，如今只有一个工人坐在“冷却矿自动运输机”旁照看机器就够了。工厂的一大块心病去掉了。推、筛、翻矿的工人们感到自己可以多活十年参加国家建设工作了。
    技术革新运动全面开始了
    冷却矿自动运输机制造成功后，兄弟车间、兄弟厂矿都派人来参观，而四○一厂的技术革新运动更全面地开展起来了。焙烧车间的工人们，由矿舍到加料口安装了轻便的小铁道，用小铁车运矿石代替了过去用肩抬矿石，工人们十分高兴地称它为“直达快车”；在车间最高一层楼上安装了一架小卷扬机，代替了过去用人工经过铁梯、一层楼又一层楼地往上面抬矿尘；安装了一台自动辗磨机，代替了过去用人力推石滚子来压疙瘩矿；更制造了扁嘴管，利用压缩空气，来扫除炉内粘在炉臂、炉齿上的矿石，代替了过去必须大开炉门，工人们用扁铲、铁钎等工具进行扫炉的艰苦的体力劳动，因此大大缩短了扫炉时间，稳定了炉温、保证了产品的质量，较过去人力扫炉提高效率十二倍。在短短的两三个月中，技术革新运动全部改变了焙烧车间的面貌。其他车间也先后采用了自动配料、自动分析、自动清洗低温、自动纪录等二十五项建议。甚至在煤气发生炉的煤斗上，材料员同志也创造了自动计加煤量的小表。修配车间的小徒工也学习了苏联先进经验，制造了“无齿锯”代替了人力用手锯来锯钢管、钢棍，提高效率四十五倍。虽然每件创造的价值不能一一用钱数计算出来，但从一九五三年第三季度的劳动生产率较第二季度提高百分之二十六点六看来，成绩是相当可观的了。
    又突破了两大关键
    四○一厂虽然是由一九五三年下半年就搞起了技术革新运动，实际上只是在第三季度轰了一阵，第四季度便无声无息了。今年二月份，生产节节下降，计划没能完成，厂的领导上才又把技术革新运动继续发动起来了。三月份召开了全厂生产代表会议，和先进生产者、合理化建议积极分子会议，颁布了关键课题，号召全体职工学习王崇伦的革新精神，大力提合理化建议，扭转当前生产不正常局面，并把生产技术科的重要工程技术人员按照专业分工，派往车间、深入工段去解决技术问题，又进一步健全了全厂的合理化建议与推广先进经验的组织制度（明确了主要由各级一长负责），因而革新运动又进入新的高潮。三月份共出现了二百零一项合理化建议，其中有九项重大技术革新的建议，执行后使得三月份的生产情况大大好转，不仅彻底扭转了生产下降的趋势，超额完成了计划，并弥补了二月份的亏空，保证了全部产品超额完成了第一季度的计划（尤其是上缴利润完成了百分之二百）。
    在这九项重大技术革新中最突出的是煤气发生炉的技术操作方面的革新。煤气发生炉是冶炼工厂供应高温热力的来源和稳定生产的基础。以前一座煤气发生炉的煤气量只能供应四座蒸馏炉用，这次改进操作后，同样一座发生炉则可供应八座蒸馏炉的煤气，这就等于不化分文钱又增添了一倍的设备。煤气发生炉的技术革新不仅给其他技术革新打下了基础，也给工厂扩大生产提供了先决条件。其次是往蒸馏炉加焦炭，热补炉和抽梁换柱打悬矿等的成功，基本上突破了产品杂质多和“炉体寿命短”两大关键问题。由三月份初步试行往蒸锅炉内加焦炭的结果看来，在三月三十一日那天全部炉子的产品均达到百分之九九·九的质量标准，在三号炉曾创造了含铅降低到○·○○九八的新纪录（一般在○·○五左右），三月份平均占总产量百分之二十三点八的产品质量达到百分之九十九·九的标准，炉日产量亦较二月份平均提高了百分之十二点八，并曾创炉日产量最高纪录。由于热补炉的成功，可以把我们过去停炉冷补，升温、预热十四天的时间缩短到三、四十分钟，这样一年即可增开一百○八个炉子；如能由此延长炉体寿命到三年以上，则每个炉子每年即可节省大修理费用十四至十五亿元。再次是执行湿矿熔烧（废掉坑矿、碎矿工序）及分工间断抢炉法（缩短抢炉时间百分之三十以上）的成功，大大减少了矿石的无名损失及二氧化硫的逸出，如以每年提高实收率百分之一来计算，即可节省十二亿元，当然价值也并不仅只表现在实收率上，他如人工、机电、燃料等的节约，尤其是对改善劳动条件和提高质量、稳定炉温方面的好处，都是相当大的。
    争取新的成就
    为了巩固并充实技术革新的成果，引导技术革新运动走向新的高潮，四○一厂职工进一步制订了在完成一九五四年国家计划的基础上再为国家增产节约一百五十亿元的计划，同时并提出了全厂新的三大关键问题，一是全面提高金属实收率，减少金属损失；二是全面提高产品质量；三是在进一步作好设备维护的基础上，尽量发挥设备利用率，延长设备寿命。最近工程技术人员们又提出了一项新的重大建议，可以在完成一百五十亿元增产节约计划的基础上，再为祖国增产节约三百二十八亿元。四○一厂全体职工正欢欣鼓舞，信心百倍地为争取新的成就而努力奋斗。
