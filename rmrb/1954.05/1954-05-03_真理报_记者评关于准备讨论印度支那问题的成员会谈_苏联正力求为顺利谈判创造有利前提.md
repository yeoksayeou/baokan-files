(From a "Pravda" Correspondent) TASS, Moscow, 29th: A "Pravda" correspondent in Geneva writes: Besides discussing the Korean issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, preparations are now underway to discuss the Indochina issue. This issue, like the Korean issue, is receiving the closest attention from a wide range of people.

    The correspondent pointed out that the Soviet delegation's report at the press conference on the 28th regarding Molotov and Bidault's talks on the membership of the conference discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina is noteworthy. Journalists attending the press conference pointed out that the Soviet delegation is striving to create favorable conditions for the smooth negotiation of the Indochina issue. However, the enemies of peace are plotting to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina. It is noteworthy that, just before the Geneva Conference is about to discuss the Indochina issue, certain people in the United States and a group of French people colluding with them are repeatedly plotting adventurous conspiracies to further expand the Indochina War.

    Wherever there is a strategic base, a source of valuable raw materials, or a profitable market for selling American goods, the American diplomatic authorities shamelessly claim that there are "vital American interests" in that area, no matter how far it is from the United States. This has become a routine. The American ruling clique is going to Indochina under this banner. From this, it is entirely understandable that American army and navy generals are visiting Indochina with increasing frequency. The veil covering the American diplomatic authorities' behind-the-scenes activities on the Indochina issue is gradually being lifted. It is now known that during the talks in Paris between Dulles, Eden, and Bidault, the US Secretary of State once again attempted to achieve the internationalization of the Indochina War. Precisely to achieve this goal, the American ruling clique is desperately trying to drag some of its allies, especially Britain, into military intervention in the Indochina War before the Geneva Conference.

    However, the American aggressive plan to expand the Indochina War has met with resolute opposition from the French public. The American plan has also caused alarm in Britain. The American ruling clique, based on its declared "policy of strength," is doing its best to create psychological preparation at home for expanding military operations in Asia by various means. However, ordinary Americans know from the painful experience of the Korean War what the consequences of new adventures in Southeast Asia would be.

    The call for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue is growing louder and louder, whether in Asian and European countries or in the United States. Therefore, the conspiracies of the enemies of peace to delay and expand the war in the Southeast Asian region have aroused even greater indignation among the broad masses of society. It is now undeniable that a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue is unimaginable without the participation of representatives from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the Geneva Conference. The fate of the people of Indochina cannot be decided behind their backs, regardless of their hopes and interests.

### “真理报”记者评关于准备讨论印度支那问题的成员会谈  苏联正力求为顺利谈判创造有利前提

    “真理报”记者评关于准备讨论印度支那问题的成员会谈
    苏联正力求为顺利谈判创造有利前提
   【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：“真理报”驻日内瓦记者写道：在外长会议上，除讨论朝鲜问题以外，现在正在进行讨论印度支那问题的准备。这一问题和朝鲜问题同样是广大人士最为密切注意的。
    记者指出，苏联代表团在二十八日的记者招待会上报告了关于莫洛托夫和皮杜尔就讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的会议的成员进行会谈的情况，这是一件值得注意的事。参加记者招待会的记者指出，苏联代表团力求为印度支那问题的顺利谈判创造有利的前提。但是，和平的敌人却在策划阴谋，以图阻挠恢复印度支那的和平。这里值得注意的一件事是：正当日内瓦会议即将讨论印度支那问题的前夕，美国的某些人士以及和他们相勾结的法国一批人接二连三地在策划冒险性的阴谋活动，以图进一步扩大印度支那战争。
    只要哪里有战略基地、贵重原料的产地或是销售美国货的有利可图的市场，美国外交当局就厚颜无耻地说在那个离美国最辽远的地区有着“美国的切身利益”。这已经成为惯例了。美国统治集团正是打着这种招牌向印度支那走去。由此看来，美国的陆、海军将领日益频繁地到印度支那去，也就完全可以理解了。遮掩美国外交当局在印度支那问题上进行幕后活动的那层幕布渐渐揭开了。现在大家知道，杜勒斯、艾登和皮杜尔在巴黎会谈时，美国国务卿又一次图谋达到使印度支那战争国际化的目的。正是为了达到这种目的，美国统治集团在日内瓦会议前夕，拚命想要把它的一些盟国，特别是英国，拖去对印度支那战争进行军事干涉。
    但是，美国扩大印度支那战争的侵略计划，遭到法国公众的坚决反对。美国的打算也引起了英国的惊慌。美国统治集团本着它所宣布的“实力政策”，竭力以种种办法为了在亚洲扩大军事行动而在国内制造心理上的准备。但是，普通的美国人从朝鲜战争的惨痛经验中知道，对东南亚的新的冒险会带来怎样的结果。
    要求和平解决印度支那问题的呼声，无论是在亚洲和欧洲各国，还是在美国，都是越来越响亮了。因此，和平的敌人企图拖延和扩大东南亚地区战争的阴谋，引起了广大社会人士的更大愤慨。如果没有越南民主共和国的代表参加日内瓦会议，要和平解决印度支那问题是不可想像的，这在目前已是无可置辩的了。不能背着印度支那人民，不顾他们的希望和利益，来决定他们的命运。
