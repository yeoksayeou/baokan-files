Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 30th: The Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party continued its sessions on the 28th.

	At the morning session, Imre Nagy, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Working People's Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, delivered a report on the second item on the agenda: the tasks of state organs and local people's councils.

	A large part of Nagy's report discussed the development history of the Hungarian People's Democratic system, and argued for this development from the perspective of Marxist-Leninist theory. He spoke of the existing shortcomings of the People's Independent Front. He suggested that the Congress entrust the soon-to-be-elected Party Central Committee to, with the participation of mass organizations and local people's councils, formulate new provisions for the organizational form and activity goals of the People's Front as soon as possible, so as to unite more middle-class masses, urban petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals and staff members. Nagy pointed out that since the liberation of Hungary, there have never been such favorable conditions for the unity and solidarity of the Party, government and people as there are today. The Congress should make a decision stipulating that the new People's Front hold a national congress this autumn.

	Nagy then talked about the work and shortcomings of local people's councils and state administrative organs, as well as ways to improve their shortcomings and their future tasks. When talking about improving the work of the Council of Ministers itself, he pointed out that the Council of Ministers should deal more with state management issues, establish direct contact with the executive committees of state people's councils, establish effective supervision over the executive committees, and provide effective leadership. In order to fulfill the tasks of the local people's councils in the new stage of socialist construction, it is necessary to give more play to their spirit of independent responsibility in financial, economic and administrative work. The executive committees of the local people's councils should provide more leadership to local industry and try to further develop local industry to improve the material welfare of the working people. An important task of the local people's councils is to develop agriculture. It must pay special attention to the socialist transformation of agriculture, consolidate agricultural production cooperatives organizationally and economically, protect public property, and strengthen labor discipline and state discipline. Party organizations and every Party member should do their best to help improve the work of state administrative organs.

	At the afternoon session, the delegates began to discuss Nagy's report.

    匈牙利劳动人民党代表大会讨论第二项议程
    纳吉报告国家机关和地方人民会议的任务
   【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会在二十八日继续开会。
    在上午会议上，劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员、匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席伊·纳吉，就第二项议程作了国家机关和地方人民会议的任务的报告。
    纳吉的报告有很大一部分是论述匈牙利人民民主制度的发展历史，并根据马克思列宁主义理论的观点来论证这一发展。他谈到了人民独立阵线现存的缺点。他建议代表大会委托即将选出的党中央委员会在群众组织和地方人民会议的参加下，尽快地拟订出人民阵线的组织形式的新条款和活动目标，以便团结更多的中间阶层群众、城市小资产阶级、知识分子和职员。纳吉指出：自匈牙利解放以来，从来没有过像今天这样有利于党、政府和人民的统一和团结的条件。代表大会应作出决定，规定新的人民阵线在今年秋天举行一次全国代表大会。
    纳吉接着谈到地方人民会议和国家管理机关的工作和缺点，以及改进它们的缺点的办法和它们今后的任务。他在谈到改进部长会议本身的工作时指出：部长会议应该更多地处理国家管理的问题，和州人民会议执行委员会建立直接的联系，建立对执行委员会的有效监督，并加以有效的领导。为了完成地方人民会议在社会主义建设新阶段的任务，必须更多地发挥其在财政、经济和行政工作中独立负责的精神。地方人民会议执行委员会应当对地方工业进行更多的领导，设法进一步发展地方工业，以提高劳动人民的物质福利。地方人民会议的重大任务是发展农业。它必须特别注意农业的社会主义改造，从组织上和经济上巩固农业生产合作社，保护公有财产，加强劳动纪律和国家纪律。党组织以及每个党员都应当竭力协助改进国家管理机关的工作。
    在下午会议上，代表们开始讨论纳吉的报告。
