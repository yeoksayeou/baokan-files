    Henan's Yellow River Irrigation Area Expects a Bumper Wheat Harvest
    The People's Victory Canal in Henan Province is diverting water from the Yellow River to irrigate millions of mu of land on the North Henan Plain at a rate of one thousand mu per flow unit per day and night. The 350,000 mu of wheat fields within the irrigation area have already been irrigated three to four times. The gradually yellowing wheat ears sway in the wind, and the fields have turned into a yellow-green ocean. In another half month, a rich harvest will be in hand. The farmers are eagerly anticipating the harvest day and night, intensifying their prevention against fog and wind, and welcoming and protecting this bumper harvest. The cotton seedlings in the 180,000 mu of cotton fields within the irrigation area have emerged two to three inches high, and the farmers are carrying out thinning according to the advanced Soviet close-planting experience.
    This year, the Yellow River Irrigation and Sanitation Management Bureau of Henan Province is striving to increase the irrigation efficiency from an average of 800 mu per flow unit per day and night last year to about 1,500 mu, in order to ensure the realization of the grain and cotton production increase plan in the irrigation area and to further expand the actual benefited area. At present, the farmers in the irrigation area are further repairing canals, reinforcing dangerous works, and reducing breaches and leakage; and according to the slope direction of the land, they are adding ridge ditches below the branch canals to make water diversion smooth. The Yellow River Irrigation and Sanitation Management Bureau is also experimenting with the implementation of the scientific water distribution plan formulated with the help of Soviet expert Rukov, and mobilizing the masses of farmers to implement a day and night rotational irrigation system to shorten the water use time.
    The Yellow River Irrigation Area in Henan Province is a fertile plain rich in wheat and cotton. Since the People's Victory Canal began diverting water from the Yellow River for irrigation in 1952, good news of bumper harvests of grain and cotton has been reported here one after another. In the autumn of 1952, there was a severe drought. The 280,000 mu of cotton and grain crops that received Yellow River water irrigation increased production by more than double compared with those that were not irrigated. In the autumn of 1953, it did not rain for more than three months. More than 300,000 mu of land in the irrigation area received Yellow River water irrigation, and wheat was sown in a timely manner. Last winter and this spring, farmers in the irrigation area also conscientiously repaired nearly 5,900 kilometers of agricultural canals and branch canals throughout the area. Most wheat fields were irrigated one to two more times than last year, and the wheat is growing even better than in previous years. It is estimated that the 50,000 mu of wheat fields in the fourth district of Xinxiang County, which received Yellow River water irrigation, will have a 10% increase in yield this year compared to last year.

### 河南省引黄灌溉区小麦可望丰收

    河南省引黄灌溉区小麦可望丰收
    河南省人民胜利渠正以每个流量一昼夜浇地一千亩的速度，引黄河的水灌溉豫北平原上的千万亩土地。灌溉区内的三十五万亩麦田已经浇过三遍到四遍。逐渐变黄的麦穗迎风摆动，田野变成了一片黄绿色的海洋。再过半月，一个丰盛的收获就到手了。农民们正以日夜翘盼的心情，加紧防范雾、风，迎接和保卫这个丰收。灌溉区内的十八万亩棉田，棉苗已出土两三寸高，农民们正在按照苏联的先进密植经验，进行间苗。
    今年引黄灌溉济卫管理局为了保障灌溉区的粮棉增产计划的实现，正设法把浇地效率从去年每个流量平均一昼夜浇地八百亩提高到一千五百亩左右，以进一步扩大实际的受益面积。目前，灌溉区的农民正进一步整修渠道，加固险工，减少决口和漏水；并根据土地坡度方向，在毛渠以下添修垅沟，使引水顺畅。引黄灌溉济卫管理局并试验执行苏联专家儒可夫帮助制订的科学配水计划，发动农民群众执行日夜轮灌制度，以缩短用水时间。
    河南省引黄灌溉区是一个盛产小麦和棉花的肥沃平原。一九五二年人民胜利渠开始引黄河水灌溉后，这里便接连传出了粮棉丰收的喜讯。一九五二年秋季大旱，得到黄水灌溉的二十八万多亩棉粮作物，比未浇水的增产了一倍以上。一九五三年秋季三个多月没下雨，灌溉区内的三十多万亩土地得到黄水灌溉，小麦适时下种。去冬今春灌溉区农民又认真整修了全区近五千九百多公里长的农渠和毛渠，大部麦田比去年多浇了一遍到两遍水，小麦长的又赛过了往年。新乡县四区得到黄水灌溉的五万多亩麦田，估计今年收成要比去年增产一成。
