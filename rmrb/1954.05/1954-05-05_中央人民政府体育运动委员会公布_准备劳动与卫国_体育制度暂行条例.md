    Central People's Government Sports Commission Announces
    "Prepare for Labor and Defend the Country" Provisional Regulations for the Sports System
    The Central People's Government Sports Commission announced on May 4th the provisional regulations for the "Prepare for Labor and Defend the Country" sports system, provisional project standards, and preliminary-level provisional regulations.
    The "Prepare for Labor and Defend the Country" sports system (referred to as the "Labor and Defense" system) is the basic system for conducting comprehensive physical education for the working people in the People's Republic of China. Its task is to ensure the widespread and regular development of sports activities, continuously improve sports techniques, and enable every participant to become a strong, brave, determined, and optimistic defender of the motherland and builder of socialism through "Labor and Defense" system training.
    Due to the great influence of Chairman Mao's "Three Goods" instruction and the implementation of the "Physical Exercise Standards" over the past two years, a good physical and technical foundation has been laid for the trial implementation of the "Labor and Defense" system. Therefore, the Central People's Government Sports Commission proposed in its 1954 work plan: In secondary schools and above nationwide that are implementing the "Labor and Defense" system preliminary level (i.e., the original "Physical Exercise Standards"), select schools with better conditions to focus on the pilot implementation of the "Labor and Defense" system. All military units across the country, in addition to strengthening physical training, should also gradually implement the "Labor and Defense" system in a planned manner.
    The "Labor and Defense" system provisional regulations announced this time stipulate that, based on physical fitness, technology, and the development of sports in our country, the "Labor and Defense" system is divided into three levels: preliminary, first, and second. It is also divided according to age and gender: Men aged fifteen to seventeen are in the first group, eighteen to twenty-eight in the second group, and twenty-nine and above in the third group; women aged fourteen to fifteen are in the first group, sixteen to twenty-three in the second group, and twenty-four and above in the third group. The training programs include the development of four human body functions: strength, endurance, agility, and speed. The project standards for the preliminary level shall be formulated by each grassroots unit in accordance with the spirit of the "Labor and Defense" system and in light of specific conditions; the project standards for the first and second levels shall be uniformly stipulated by the whole country. Those who pass the
  "Labor and Defense" system Levels 1 and 2 tests will be issued unified certificates and medals by the sports committees at all levels authorized by the Central People's Government Sports Commission. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央人民政府体育运动委员会公布
    “准备劳动与卫国”体育制度暂行条例
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会在五月四日公布“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度的暂行条例、暂行项目标准及预备级暂行条例。
    “准备劳动与卫国”体育制度（简称“劳卫”制）是中华人民共和国向劳动人民进行全面体育教育的基本制度。它的任务在保证体育运动广泛地、经常地开展，运动技术不断地提高，使每一参加者通过“劳卫”制的训练，成为健壮、勇敢、坚毅、乐观的祖国保卫者和社会主义建设者。
    由于毛主席“三好”指示的巨大影响以及两年来“体育锻炼标准”的推行，已为“劳卫”制的试行打下了体能上和技术上的良好基础。因此，中央人民政府体育运动委员会在一九五四年工作计划中提出：在全国推行“劳卫”制预备级（即原“体育锻炼标准”）的中等以上学校中，选择条件较好的学校，重点试行“劳卫”制。全国各部队，除加强体育训练外，亦应有计划地逐步推行“劳卫”制。
    这次公布的“劳卫”制暂行条例中规定：根据体能、技术及我国体育运动的发展情况，“劳卫”制分为预备级、第一级、第二级等三级。又按照年龄、性别分：男子十五岁到十七岁为第一组、十八岁到二十八岁为第二组、二十九岁以上为第三组；女子十四岁到十五岁为第一组、十六岁到二十三岁为第二组、二十四岁以上为第三组。锻炼项目中包括发展体力、耐久力、灵敏和速度四种人体机能的训练。预备级的项目标准由各基层单位根据“劳卫”制的精神、结合具体情况因地制宜制定，第一级和第二级的项目标准由全国统一规定。凡参加
  “劳卫”制一、二级测验及格者，由中央人民政府体育运动委员会授权各级体委发给统一的证书和奖章。（新华社）
