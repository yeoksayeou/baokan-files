    The Central Ministry of Education Directs Local Education Administrative Departments to Select Primary School Teachers and Normal School Graduates to Apply for Higher Normal Schools
    In order to guarantee meeting the enrollment needs of higher normal schools, the Central People's Government Ministry of Education instructed local education administrative departments to select three thousand outstanding primary school teachers and nine thousand normal school graduating students to apply for higher normal schools. The quality of admitted students must meet the standards. The instruction pointed out that this is a necessary measure to solve the problem of secondary school teachers in the future, and the selection of outstanding primary school teachers is also one of the ways to encourage in-service primary school teachers to work hard and study. Education administrative departments in various regions must pay attention to this. In the past, various regions generally adopted a serious attitude towards the selection and sending work. However, individual regions, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of this work, adopted a purely task-oriented view when selecting primary school teachers, adopting assignment methods; or harboring localism, refusing to select teachers with development prospects. As a result, it caused many difficulties for higher normal schools and seriously affected the state's plan for cultivating teachers. When selecting normal school students, individual regions did not conduct publicity and mobilization, but only made decisions by the school leaders, which caused dissatisfaction among students in some schools. Therefore, the instruction requires all regions to first do a good job in publicity, education, and organization when selecting candidates, and to earnestly grasp the principle of careful review and selecting the best. It is also necessary to explain the purpose and significance of the selection in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the selected primary school teachers and normal school graduating students in learning and strengthen their sense of responsibility for serving the people's education. In normal schools, it is also necessary to prevent the erroneous tendency of students only wanting to go to higher education and not wanting to be primary school teachers.

    中央教育部指示各地教育行政部门
    选拔小学教师、师范毕业生报考高等师范
    为了保证满足高等师范学校招生需要，中央人民政府教育部指示各地教育行政部门，选拔三千名优秀的小学教师和九千名师范学校应届毕业生报考高等师范学校。录取生的质量，必须合乎标准。指示中指出：这是解决今后中等学校师资问题的必要措施，而优秀小学教师的选拔，同时也是鼓励在职小学教师努力工作和学习的办法之一，各地教育行政部门必须予以重视。过去，各地区对于选送工作，一般都采取认真的态度。但有个别地区因对这项工作的重要性认识不足，在选送小学教师时，产生单纯任务观点，采取指派办法；或存有本位主义思想，不肯选送有培养前途的教师。结果，给高等师范学校造成很多困难，严重地影响了国家培养师资的计划。在选送师范生时，个别地区不进行宣传动员，只由学校领导方面决定，因而在某些学校中引起同学的不满。因此，指示中要求各地在选送时，首先必须做好宣传教育和组织工作，切实掌握认真审查、择优选送的原则。并要讲清选送的目的和意义，以鼓励被选送的小学教师和师范学校应届毕业生的学习热情，加强他们为人民教育事业服务的责任感。在师范学校也要防止造成学生只愿升学不愿作小学教师的错误倾向。
