    Soviet Advanced Collective Farms
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    The day after the All-Russian Conference of Agricultural Advanced Workers closed, I met with several collective farm chairmen who attended the conference for a discussion. They described the situation of their collective farms from various perspectives, either briefly or in detail.
      (I)
    First to speak was P.A. Prozorov, chairman of the "Red October" Collective Farm in Vozhegalsky District, Kirov Oblast.
    The newspaper has already introduced the situation of the "Red October" Collective Farm: Kirov Oblast is northeast of Moscow Oblast, and the soil and climate conditions are not very good. However, because the "Red October" Collective Farm emphasizes advanced techniques such as deep plowing, fertilization, seed selection, and crop rotation, the yields of grain, vegetables, and potatoes are very high. In the past four years, its grain yield has exceeded 20 quintals (4,000 jin) per hectare (15 mu). In 1953, rye yielded 25 quintals per hectare. One production team harvested 31 quintals of rye per hectare on 100 hectares of land. The collective farm has more than 2,000 square meters of greenhouses and 1,500 hotbeds for growing vegetables. It has seven livestock farms raising cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, poultry, rabbits, and silver foxes, as well as an apiary. In 1953, the collective farm's cash income was 2.6 million rubles, with an average cash income of 2,000 rubles per hectare of cultivated land.
    Like all collective farms in the Soviet Union, the achievements of the "Red October" Collective Farm were only possible after the establishment of the collective farm system. How did the local farmers embark on the road to collectivization? Comrade Prozorov recalled the situation at the time.
    Like all rural areas in Russia before the October Revolution, the farmers in his village were very poor, and many people went to the city to make a living. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, people who returned from the city organized the Poor Peasants' Committee to explain the policies of the Soviet government to the farmers and lead them to distribute land for use according to the population. Six Russian acres of the worst land were reserved for the Poor Peasants' Committee for public use. Members of the Poor Peasants' Committee cultivated the land on Sundays. They adopted new technologies on this land, and the income was not distributed but used as a public fund to buy simple farm implements. At that time, the Poor Peasants' Committee had 22 households; they could not maintain their lives with the land they were allocated, so they often went to the district to find work, accumulated some money, and organized brick production in the village, which accommodated the surplus labor force in the village. In this way, they developed the habit of collective labor.
    Later, in 1924, the Land Cultivation Cooperative was organized on this basis. Members cultivated the land together on collective labor days. The management committee stipulated the work for the next day. Work points were recorded. Income was mainly distributed according to labor. Twelve percent of the total income of the cooperative was used as a public fund. At that time, rich peasants carried out sabotage activities: burning houses, inserting wooden poles into the ground to damage farm implements, spreading rumors, and provoking relations between members. However, all activities to obstruct farmers from taking the road of collectivization failed.
    By 1927, the Agricultural Labor Association (collective farm) was established on the basis of the Cultivation Cooperative, and all means of production were publicly owned. At that time, there were a total of four collective farms in the area. They jointly established repair shops, brick workshops, mills, and oil presses. The relationship between them became closer year by year. By 1929, they merged into one collective farm with a total of 110 households and 520 people. It was not until 1931 that labor, land, and farm implements began to be assigned to fixed production teams.
    When guiding farmers to take the road of collectivization, they paid great attention to using facts for persuasion and education. In the past, only rich peasants had agricultural machinery, and they also used agricultural machinery for exploitation. The Cultivation Cooperative bought agricultural machinery, which had a great impact on the middle peasants who could not afford agricultural machinery. The Cultivation Cooperative also allocated some funds to run nurseries and helped poor individual farmers with plowing cattle, seeds, etc. At the same time, intellectuals in the village were mobilized to do propaganda work. By 1927, Party and League organizations were established in the village, and they played a leading role.
      (II)
    A. Tchaikovsky, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in Shalsky District, Rostov Oblast, spoke about the history and current situation of the farm.
    Before the October Revolution, the Shalsk steppe was sparsely populated, with villages every thirty or forty kilometers. The land between the villages was the landlord's horse farm. The bare land along the Manych River only grew some feather grass. The steppe was very dry, and the crops did not grow well. Farmers could only harvest six or seven poods (about 200 jin per 15 mu) of grain from one hectare of cultivated land, and the poor peasants and poor middle peasants did not have enough income to support their families. Landlords and rich peasants generally did not live there, but only sent their stewards.
    After the October Revolution, the land was nationalized. State farms appeared on the original landlord's horse farms. In 1922, fifty or sixty poor peasant households in the area received thousands of hectares of land from the state for use, and these lands were connected to the state farms. Among these poor peasants, there were only twenty-six horses and twenty plowing cattle. They organized to reclaim wasteland and sow winter wheat. The cultivated land expanded year by year in three years. By 1925, they established the Agricultural Labor Association (collective farm). At this time, there was 50,000 rubles of public funds, and they bought horse-drawn plows, horse-drawn seeders, and horse-drawn harvesters. At this time, there were still fifty or sixty households, but the cultivated land had expanded to 700 hectares.
    Farmers from the surrounding villages, especially middle peasants, often came to visit. They saw that the collective farm had high yields and that the villagers lived well. In the five years from organizing collective labor to establishing the collective farm, the families of collective farmers had added things and began to move from earthen houses to new houses. However, no matter how hard individual farmers worked, their lives did not improve much. The farmers were convinced of the benefits of collectivization, and one after another applied to join the collective farm. The collective farm had 150 households by 1927 and 260 households by 1929. Because many middle peasants joined, the means of production also increased, and the number of horses increased to fifty.
    After the establishment of the collective farm, the strength of the farmers was much stronger. Not only did they develop production on a large scale, but they also built their own bricks to build houses and planted forests to resist drought. In 1930, production teams began to be organized; in addition to field and livestock production teams, there were also construction and afforestation production teams. The brick workshop established in 1929 had developed into a brick factory by 1936. Self-made bricks were used to build public buildings and villagers' houses. There was originally no forest in the local grassland. In 1936, shelterbelts 20 meters wide were planted around and in the middle of this square land. Now the trees in the shelterbelts have grown to 12 meters high, and they protect the crops from drought winds.
    Now the Stalin Collective Farm has 425 members, operating 5,800 hectares of land, including 4,473 hectares of cultivated land, 386 hectares of pastures, 328 hectares of shelterbelts, 60 hectares of orchards, 50 hectares of vineyards, 60 hectares of forests for supplying building materials, and the rest are villagers' private plots and buildings. On nearly 2,000 hectares of land planted with grain, the average grain yield in the last three dry years was no less than 17-18 quintals per hectare, and some reached 28-30 quintals, and corn yielded 35-40 quintals per hectare. The collective farm's livestock farms raise: 1,160 cattle (including 351 dairy cows, producing 700,000 liters of milk); 210 Don breed horses; 1,224 pigs; 3,153 sheep (including 1,000 fine-wool sheep); 8,900 poultry; and 210 boxes of bees.
    Mechanization has become a characteristic of field work and animal husbandry work in the Stalin Collective Farm. Grain is sown, harvested, and threshed by machines. During the harvest season, grain is harvested and produced at the same time; part of the grain is immediately transported to the state purchasing station by truck, and the other part immediately enters the warehouse through the conveyor belt. Livestock farms are equipped with automatic drinkers, electric milkers, cranes for transporting feed, and kitchens for cooking feed.
    Public side occupations are also numerous in the Stalin Collective Farm. It has a power plant with 70 kilowatts of electricity and 86 motors. It has brick factories, woodworking shops, iron factories, flour mills, rice mills, oil presses, wineries, bacon factories, veterinary stations, and artificial insemination stations for cattle and sheep.
    The collective farm now has a public accumulation fund of 7.1 million rubles, of which 5.9 million rubles are for means of production. The collective farm allocates more than 500,000 rubles from its annual cash income of 3 million rubles as a public accumulation fund.
    Compared with the situation thirty years ago, when there were only a few horses and cattle, how far have the farmers of the Shalsk steppe come?
    Based on such production development, the farmers of the Stalin Collective Farm live a good life. In 1953, each member's labor day remuneration was ten kinds of material objects such as grain, vegetables, meat, oil, milk, fruits, wine, and honey, and four rubles in cash, totaling 17 rubles in cash. The collective farm has adopted the method of paying labor day remuneration to the villagers on a monthly basis for the past three years, which has greatly facilitated the villagers. But labor day remuneration alone cannot explain the overall life of the villagers. The collective farm also has many material and cultural welfare facilities, which constitute an important aspect of the villagers' lives.
    The Stalin Collective Farm has its own construction team to build houses for the villagers, and the villagers pay according to the price. There are 350 villagers' houses built of brick and adobe brick. Ten houses have heating and bathtubs. Thirty more houses will be built this year. The collective farm has a bakery, and the villagers can exchange flour for bread. The collective farm has a large public canteen, and a new public canteen will be built this year. The collective farm has kindergartens and nurseries, taking care of 250 children. These facilitate the villagers to concentrate their energy on production.
    Cultural entertainment has become an indispensable part of the life of the members of the Stalin Collective Farm. There are two clubs with 1,000 seats and a library with 6,000 books. There are two film projectors, showing four or five times a week. The villagers watch movies more often than people in the city. There are three bands. There are parks and sports fields. Many people participate in amateur entertainment and sports activities. Radio broadcasts are set up everywhere. Bathhouses are open every day.
    Social security work is highly valued in the Stalin Collective Farm. There are 150,000 rubles in cash and a lot of grain as mutual aid funds. The Mutual Aid Fund Management Committee approves loans of 300 rubles or less for villagers; loans of more than 300 rubles are approved by the General Assembly of Villagers, and the loans are repaid within one year. The expenses of villagers' pensions, medical care, convalescence, and production are all paid from the Mutual Aid Fund. Villagers receive mutual aid funds equal to a certain labor day remuneration when they are sick and for two months before and after childbirth for women. In 1953, 30 villagers received sanatorium vouchers. There are now seven elderly villagers in the collective farm's nursing home. One of them is the 87-year-old former chairman of the collective farm. Sometimes he walks out of the nursing home and sees the prosperity of the farm's production and the happiness of the villagers' lives, and he can't help but shed tears.
    The Stalin Collective Farm will increase grain production to 23 quintals per hectare this year; vegetables - 250 quintals; potatoes - 200 quintals; and will strive to greatly increase livestock products.
    Tchaikovsky concluded: "I hope that Chinese farmers will also live the same life as us in the future: with no worries in their hearts, working hard and resting well."
      (III)
    N.F. Resikin, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in Novoalexandrovsky District, Stavropol Territory, talked about the development of the collective farm since its merger and the efforts made to implement the resolutions of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This collective farm is a model collective farm commended by the All-Russian Conference of Agricultural Advanced Workers.
    Resikin recalled that when the Chinese Farmers' Delegation visited Stavropol Territory in 1952, they visited their collective farm. The Chinese Farmers' Delegation's humble and inquisitive attitude left a deep impression on him. He enthusiastically said: "Please tell the Chinese Farmers' Delegation that our collective farm will fulfill its promise ahead of schedule. At that time, we assured our Chinese friends that our cash income would reach 20 million rubles by 1955. This can be achieved in 1954. I hope that Chinese farmers will advance like us."
    This Stalin Collective Farm has 1,780 households, more than 2,000 laborers, and uses 22,000 hectares of state-owned land, of which 18,000 hectares are cultivated land. It was merged from eight collective farms in August 1950. These eight collective farms were established in 1930, developed before the war, suffered losses during the Great Patriotic War, and had relatively low yields after the war due to insufficient machinery and uncleared fields. After the merger, the strength of the collective farm was greatly strengthened. Thanks to hard work, production has developed rapidly. In three years, the harvest of grain and oil crops has doubled, livestock products have increased a lot, and cash income has increased five or six times. Resikin believes that this is only the beginning of the Stalin Collective Farm's great development of the collective farm economy, and it must give full play to its potential to realize the party's call.
    The first is to develop animal husbandry. The members of the Stalin Collective Farm started by strengthening the feed base. In the past three years, the cultivated area of ​​feed crops has been expanded five times, but it is not enough for the current large-scale development of animal husbandry. Due to the improvement of agricultural technology, many collective farms in the territory can use planted fallow land (planting early-maturing crops that can restore land fertility and eliminate weeds on land that should be completely fallow) and semi-fallow land instead of completely fallow land to make full use of the land. In 1954, due to the use of this potential, the Stalin Collective Farm will add 4,000 hectares of feed crops land, thereby additionally increasing 44,000 quintals of hay, 165,000 quintals of green feed, and 162,000 quintals of juicy feed. Using this potential, the area of ​​"Sudan" pasture will also be expanded to 1,000 hectares, and 15,000 quintals of seeds will be harvested to supply the needs of other collective farms in Stavropol Territory.
    Increasing the planting of melon feed crops has received great attention from the members of the Stalin Collective Farm. Pumpkin is a major feed crop in the territory. Even in dry years, 20-30 tons of pumpkin can be harvested per hectare. 150 hectares were planted in 1953, and 700 hectares will be planted in 1954. Melon crops will be continuously produced to ensure that livestock can eat juicy feed from July to January or February.
    The development of animal husbandry will enable the Stalin Collective Farm to earn 7.34 million rubles in cash from this area alone in 1954, an increase of half compared with 1953. In the future, the cash income of animal husbandry will account for half of the total cash income of the farm.
    Expanding the area of ​​square spot sowing and square cluster sowing of intercropping crops is another potential that the Stalin Collective Farm can exploit. It sowed 3,000 hectares in 1953 using this method, saving 36,000 man-days. Due to saving manpower and seeds, more than 500,000 rubles were saved. In 1954, 4,000 hectares will be sown using this method, in addition to sunflowers, corn, and castor beans, as well as melons, potatoes, and vegetables. Square spot sowing and cluster sowing methods help to increase yields. From 1950 to 1953, the yield of corn increased from 9 quintals per hectare to 24 quintals, and sunflowers increased from 4.7 quintals per hectare to 16.4 quintals. The cash income from melons and vegetables was 1.3 million rubles in 1953, and will increase to nearly 5 million rubles in 1954.
    Crop production is the main economic sector of the Stalin Collective Farm. Winter wheat alone is sown on 6,000 hectares. The main way to increase crop yields is through deep plowing and advanced agricultural technology. The total grain harvest will increase from more than 150,000 quintals in 1953 to 200,000 quintals in 1954.
    Based on the development of diversified economy, from 1953 to 1954, the Stalin Collective Farm's cash income will increase from 12.8 million rubles to 20 million rubles; the public accumulation fund will increase from 7 million rubles to more than 10 million rubles; the remuneration for each labor day will increase from 7 rubles in cash and 3 kilograms of grain and other materials to 11 rubles and 38 kopecks in cash and more than 3 kilograms of grain and other materials. This is a powerful manifestation of the strength of the collective farm system.
    The development of the Stalin Collective Farm is closely related to its labor organization and its cooperation with the tractor station. Its production team has greatly interested the farmers' delegations from various People's Democratic countries such as China, Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Its seven large production teams are comprehensive in nature, combining farming and animal husbandry, managing vast fields of grain, technical crops, and feed crops, and a certain number of livestock farms. Livestock farms do not have separate production teams. Each production team has a tractor team to serve it. The entire collective farm has a local tractor station to serve it, which owns 100 tractors, 50 combine harvesters, and other agricultural machinery. The production team and the tractor team are carrying out close cooperation. Their production tasks are jointly issued by the chairman of the collective farm and the station manager of the tractor station every ten days. This eliminates any inconsistency between the collective farm and the tractor station. It has become a habit: on the 9th, 19th, and 29th of each month, the chairman of the collective farm, the station manager of the tractor station, the production team leader, the tractor team leader, and the agronomist hold a meeting. At the meeting, each team puts forward its ten-day plan that has already been thought out, and everyone collectively considers it, adds to it or modifies it, and then the farm chairman and the station manager sign it and issue it as an instruction. The field rest stations of the production team and the tractor team are unified, and the field canteens are also shared. This organizational form is considered successful. Not only Stavropol Territory, but also the neighboring Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Oblast are promoting it.
                  ×　　×　　×
    The superior collective farm system and the large collective farms after the merger have prepared a strong and solid foundation for the further development of Soviet agriculture. It is on this basis that Soviet collective farmers are responding to the call of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with high labor enthusiasm, producing abundant products for the transition to a communist society.

    苏联先进的集体农庄
    本报记者  李何
    在全俄罗斯农业先进工作者会议闭幕后一天，我曾约会了几位参加会议的集体农庄主席座谈。他们从各个角度或简或详地叙述了自己集体农庄的情形。
      （一）
    基洛夫州沃热加尔区“红十月”集体农庄主席帕·亚·普罗佐罗夫先谈。
    报纸上已经介绍过“红十月”集体农庄的情形：基洛夫州在莫斯科州东北，土壤和气候条件不算好。但是“红十月”集体农庄因为注重深耕、施肥、选种、轮作等等先进技术，谷物、蔬菜、马铃薯的产量都很高。在最近四年中，它的谷物产量每公顷（十五市亩）超过二十公担（四千市斤）。一九五三年黑麦每公顷收了二十五公担。有一个生产队在一百公顷土地上每公顷收了三十一公担黑麦。集体农庄有两千多平方公尺温室和一千五百个温床架，用来种蔬菜。它有牛、马、羊、猪、家禽、家兔、银狐七个养畜场，还有养蜂场。一九五三年集体农庄的现金收入为二百六十万卢布，平均每公顷耕地现金收入二千卢布。
    和苏联所有集体农庄一样，“红十月”集体农庄的这些成就，都是在建立了集体农庄制度之后才有的。已往当地农民是怎样走上了集体化的道路呢？普罗佐罗夫同志回忆了当时的一段情形。
    就像十月革命前的俄国所有农村一样，他那一村农民很穷，许多人跑到城市找生活。苏维埃政权成立以后，从城市回来的人们组织了贫农委员会，向农民解释苏维埃政府的政策，领导农民按人口分土地使用。有六俄亩最坏的土地留给贫农委员会公用。贫农委员会人员在星期天耕作。他们在这块地上采用了新的技术，所得的收获不分配，作为公积金，用来买简单的农具。当时贫农委员会有二十二户；他们靠所分用的土地不够维持生活，常到区里揽工，积蓄了一些钱，在村里组织了造砖生产，容纳了村里多余的劳动力。这样，养成了集体劳动的习惯。
    后来，一九二四年，在这个基础上组织了土地共耕社。社员在集体劳动的日子，共同耕地。由管理委员会规定第二天的工作。画卯记工。主要凭劳动来分配所得。全社收入百分之十二作为公积金。当时富农进行破坏活动：烧毁房屋；在地上插木杆来弄坏农具；散布谣言；挑拨社员间的关系。但是，一切阻挠农民走集体化道路的活动都失败了。
    到一九二七年，在共耕社的基础上成立了农业劳动组合（集体农庄），所有生产资料都公有了。那时当地出现了一共四个集体农庄。它们合股开办修理坊、造砖坊、磨坊、油坊。彼此关系一年比一年密切。到一九二九年，它们合并为一个集体农庄，总共有一百一十户，五百二十人。到一九三一年才开始把劳动力、土地和农具分给固定的生产队负责。
    在引导农民走集体化道路时，他们非常注意用事实进行说服教育。以前只有富农有农业机器，他们也以农业机器进行剥削活动。共耕社买了农业机器，这对于买不起农业机器的中农很有影响。共耕社也拨一些款办托儿所，以耕牛、种籽等等帮助贫苦的单干农民。同时，村里的知识分子都动员起来做宣传工作。到了一九二七年，村里成立了党和团的组织，它们起了领导作用。
      （二）
    罗斯多夫州沙尔斯克区斯大林集体农庄主席亚·柴霍夫斯基谈了农庄的历史和现况。
    沙尔草原在十月革命以前居民稀少，隔三、四十公里才有一个村庄。村庄之间的土地是地主的养马场。马乃茨河沿岸的光秃土地只长一些羽毛草。草原很干燥，庄稼长不好。庄稼户从一公顷耕地只能收六、七普特（即十五市亩收二百市斤左右）谷物，贫农和贫苦的中农，所得不够养活一家。地主和富农一般不住在那里，只派他们的管家去。
    十月革命以后，土地收归国有。在原来地主的养马场上出现了国营农场，一九二二年当地有五六十户贫农，从国家领到了几千公顷土地使用，这些土地和国营农场相连接。这批贫农当中只有二十六匹马和二十头耕牛。他们组织起来开垦生荒地，播种冬麦。三年中耕地年年扩大。到了一九二五年，他们成立了农业劳动组合（集体农庄）。这时已有五万卢布公积金，买了马拉犁、马拉播种机、马拉收割机。这时户数还是五六十户，耕地却扩大到七百公顷。
    周围村子的农民，尤其是中农，常常来参观。他们看到集体农庄产量高，庄员的生活好。从组织起来集体劳动到建立集体农庄的五年中，集体农民的家庭都添置了东西，开始从土房子搬到新房子。但是单干农户不管怎样干活，生活没有改善多少。农民信服了集体化的好处，一个接着一个申请加入集体农庄。集体农庄到一九二七年有一百五十户，到一九二九年有二百六十户。因为许多中农加入，生产资料也增加了，马增加到五十匹。
    建立了集体农庄以后，农民的力量雄厚得多了。不仅大规模地发展生产，而且自己造砖盖屋，自己造林抗旱。一九三○年开始组织生产队；除了田间、养畜生产队以外，还有建筑、造林生产队。一九二九年建立的造砖坊到一九三六年已经发展成造砖厂。用自制的砖盖起了公共建筑物和庄员房屋。当地草原本来没有一点森林。一九三六年在这块方形土地的周围和当中种了宽二十公尺的护田林带，现在护田林带的树已长到十二公尺高，它们保障着庄稼不受旱风的侵袭。
    现在斯大林集体农庄有四百二十五户庄员，经营着五千八百公顷土地，其中四千四百七十三公顷耕地、三百八十六公顷牧场、三百二十八公顷护田林带、六十公顷果园、五十公顷葡萄园、六十公顷供给建筑材料的树林，其他是庄员的宅旁园圃和建筑物。在近两千公顷种谷物的土地上，最近三个干旱年份中，每公顷收获谷物不下十七——十八公担，有的达到二十八——三十公担，玉米每公顷收获三十五——四十公担。集体农庄的养畜场养着：一千一百六十头牛（其中三百五十一头奶牛，产牛奶七十万公升）；二百一十匹顿河名种马；一千二百二十四头猪；三千一百五十三只羊（其中一千只是细毛羊）；八千九百只家禽；二百一十箱蜜蜂。
    机械化成为斯大林集体农庄的田间工作和养畜工作的特点。谷物从播种到收割、打谷，都使用机器。在收割时节，一边收割一边出粮食；一部分粮食立即用卡车运到国家采购站，另一部分立即经过传送带入仓。养畜场都装置自动饮水器、电气挤奶器、运送饲料的吊车、煮饲料的厨房。
    公有的副业在斯大林集体农庄也是很多的。它有七十瓩发电力的发电厂、八十六台马达。它有造砖场、木工场、铁工场、磨面场、碾米场、榨油场、酿酒场、腊肉场、兽医站和牛羊人工授精站。
    这个集体农庄现有公积金七百一十万卢布，其中生产资料占五百九十万卢布。集体农庄每年从三百万卢布的现金收入中，拨五十多万卢布作为公积金。
    这样雄厚的经济，与三十年前只有几匹马和几头牛的情景比较起来，沙尔草原的农民走了多远了呵。
    在这样生产发展的基础之上，斯大林集体农庄农民过着美好的生活。庄员每个劳动日报酬在一九五三年有谷物、蔬菜、肉类、油脂、牛奶、水果、酒、蜜等十一种实物和四卢布现金，全部折合现金十七卢布。这个集体农庄三年来采取了按月预付劳动日报酬给庄员的方法，这给庄员很大便利。但是仅仅劳动日报酬不能说明庄员生活的全面。集体农庄还有许多物质和文化福利的设施，它们构成庄员生活的重要的一面。
    斯大林集体农庄自己有建筑队给庄员盖房子，庄员按价付款。有三百五十幢庄员房子是用砖和土砖盖的。有十幢房子有暖气和澡盆。今年还要盖三十幢房子。集体农庄有面包房，庄员可以拿面粉去换面包。集体农庄有大公共食堂，今年还要盖新的公共食堂。集体农庄有幼儿园和托儿所，照管着二百五十个小孩。这些都便于庄员把自己的精力集中在生产上面。
    文化娱乐成为斯大林集体农庄庄员不可缺少的生活部分。有两所设有一千个座位的俱乐部和一个有六千册存书的图书馆。有两部电影放映机，每周放映四、五次，庄员看电影的次数比城市里人还要多。有三个乐队。有公园和运动场。许多人参加业余文娱和体育活动。到处设着无线电广播。澡堂每天都开放着。
    社会保险工作在斯大林集体农庄很受重视。有十五万卢布现金和许多粮食作为互助金。庄员借款三百卢布以下的，由互助金管理委员会批准；三百卢布以上的，由全体庄员大会批准，借款一年以内归还。庄员的养老、医药、疗养、生产等费用都是由互助金项下开支的。庄员在生病时，和妇女在产前产后两个月，都得到等于一定劳动日报酬的互助金。一九五三年有三十个庄员得到疗养券。现在有七个老庄员在集体农庄的养老院。其中一位是八十七岁高龄的集体农庄前主席。他有时走出养老院，看到农庄生产的繁荣和庄员生活的幸福的情景，不禁感动得流泪。
    斯大林集体农庄在今年将提高谷物产量到每公顷二十三公担；蔬菜——二百五十公担；马铃薯——二百公担；并将为大大提高畜产品而努力。
    柴霍夫斯基最后说：“希望中国农民将来也过着和我们一样的生活：心里无所挂虑，好好劳动和好好休息。”
      （三）
    斯塔甫罗波尔边疆诺沃亚历山得罗夫区斯大林集体农庄主席纳·费·雷西金，谈了这个集体农庄合并以来的发展和为实现苏共中央九月全会决议所作的努力。这个集体农庄是受全俄罗斯农业先进工作者会议表扬的模范集体农庄。
    雷西金谈起，一九五二年中国农民代表参观团访问斯塔甫罗波尔边疆时到过他们的集体农庄。中国农民代表虚心好问的态度留给他深刻的印象。他热情地说：“请转告中国农民代表们，我们集体农庄将提前实现自己的诺言。当时我们向中国朋友保证，到一九五五年现金收入要达到二千万卢布。这在一九五四年就可以达到。希望中国农民和我们一样前进。”
    这个斯大林集体农庄有一千七百八十户，两千多劳动力，使用着二万二千公顷国有土地，其中一万八千公顷是耕地。它是在一九五○年八月由八个集体农庄合并成的。这八个集体农庄建立于一九三○年，在战前已经发展，在卫国战争时期受到损失，在战后因为机器不够和田间没有清理，收获量相当低。合并以后，集体农庄的力量大大加强，由于努力经营，生产飞跃地发展着。三年中谷物和油料作物收获量增加了一倍，畜产品增加了很多，现金收入增加了五、六倍。雷西金认为，这只是斯大林集体农庄大大发展集体农庄经济的开端，它还要发挥潜在能力，以实现党的号召。
    首先是发展养畜业。斯大林集体农庄庄员从加强饲料基地开始。三年来已经扩大饲料作物耕种面积五倍，但还不够现在大规模发展养畜业的需要。由于农业技术水平的提高，边疆的许多集体农庄可以用种有作物的休闲地（在本应完全休闲的土地上种早熟的、能恢复地力和排除杂草的作物）和半休闲地代替完全休闲地，这样来充分利用土地。斯大林集体农庄在一九五四年由于使用这个潜在力，将增添四千公顷饲料作物的土地，从而将额外增加四万四千公担干草，十六万五千公担青饲料，十六万二千公担多汁饲料。使用这个潜在力，同时将扩大“苏丹”牧草的面积到一千公顷，将收获一万五千公担种籽，以供应斯塔甫罗波尔边疆其他集体农庄的需要。
    增种瓜类饲料作物，受到斯大林集体农庄庄员很大注意。南瓜是边疆的一种主要饲料作物。甚至在旱年，每公顷也可以收二、三十吨南瓜。一九五三年种了一百五十公顷，一九五四年将种七百公顷，将连续生产瓜类作物，以保证牲畜从七月到一、二月都能吃到多汁饲料。
    养畜业的发展，使斯大林集体农庄在一九五四年单从这方面将收入现金七百三十四万卢布，比一九五三年增加半倍。将来养畜业的现金收入将占全庄现金收入的一半。
    扩大中耕作物方形点播和方形簇种的面积，是斯大林集体农庄可以发挥的另一个潜在力。它在一九五三年用这个方法播种了三千公顷，节省了三万六千个人工。由于节省人力和种籽，节约了五十多万卢布。一九五四年将用这个方法播种四千公顷，除了向日葵、玉米、蓖麻等外，还有瓜类、马铃薯和蔬菜。方形点播和簇种方法帮助提高收获量。从一九五○年到一九五三年，玉米的收获量从每公顷九公担提高到二十四公担，向日葵从每公顷四点七公担提高到十六点四公担。瓜类和蔬菜的现金收入在一九五三年为一百三十万卢布，一九五四年将增加到近五百万卢布。
    农作物是斯大林集体农庄的主要经济部门。光是冬小麦就播种了六千公顷。主要靠深耕和先进农业技术来提高农作物收获量。谷物的总收获量将从一九五三年的十五万多公担提高到一九五四年的二十万公担。
    在发展多种经济的基础上，从一九五三年到一九五四年的一年之间，斯大林集体农庄的现金收入将从一千二百八十万卢布提高到二千万卢布；公积金将从七百万卢布提高到一千万卢布以上；每个劳动日的报酬将从七卢布现金和三公斤谷物及其他实物，提高到十一卢布三十八哥比现金和三公斤以上谷物及其他实物。这是集体农庄制度的力量强大的表征。
    斯大林集体农庄的发展，是和它的劳动组织，和它与拖拉机站的合作，有密切关系的。它的生产队使中国、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利等各人民民主国家农民代表团感到很大兴趣。它的七个大生产队是综合性质的，种地兼养畜，经管着广大的谷物、技术作物、饲料作物的田地和一定数目的养畜场。养畜场不另设生产队。每个生产队有一个拖拉机队服务。整个集体农庄有当地的一个拖拉机站为它服务，这个拖拉机站拥有一百台拖拉机、五十台联合收割机和其他农业机器。生产队与拖拉机队实行着紧密的合作。它们的生产任务每十天由集体农庄主席与拖拉机站站长共同发出。这样消除了集体农庄与拖拉机站之间任何步调不一致的现象。这已经成为习惯：每月逢九日、十九日、二十九日，由集体农庄主席、拖拉机站站长、生产队队长、拖拉机队队长、农艺师开会。会上各队提出已经想好的十天计划，大家集体考虑，加以补充或修正，然后由农庄主席与站长签名，作为指令发出。生产队与拖拉机队的田间休息站是统一的，田间食堂也是共同的。这种组织形式，被认为是成功的。不仅斯塔甫罗波尔边疆，而且临近的克拉斯诺达尔边疆、罗斯多夫州，都在推广它。

    优越的集体农庄制度，合并后的大集体农庄，为苏联农业的进一步发展准备了强大的、巩固的基础。苏联集体农民正是根据这个条件，以高涨的劳动，响应苏联共产党的号召，为过渡到共产主义社会而生产着丰富的产品。
