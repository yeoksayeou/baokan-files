On the Peking Opera "Hunting the Tiger" and its Performance
Zhang Zhen
Adaptation: Fan Junhong Director: Fan Fang Performed by the China Peking Opera Troupe

"Hunting the Tiger" is one of the better Peking Opera productions adapted from ancient folk stories in recent times. The script is based on the story in the 49th chapter of "Water Margin," depicting how two young hunters, Xie Zhen and Xie Bao, are framed by landlords and bureaucrats; it also depicts how several characters with heroic qualities—the jailer Le He, the innkeepers Sun Xin and Gu Dasao, the leaders of Dengyun Mountain, Zou Yuan and Zou Run, and the Dengzhou military commander Sun Li and others—stand up for justice, break into the prison to rescue Xie Zhen and Xie Bao, and join the Liangshan rebels. This play reflects the class contradictions between the feudal rulers and the people in that era, exposes the ruthlessness and shamelessness of the feudal ruling class, portrays the suffering of good people under cruel oppression, and also depicts in relatively detail the tortuous process of the people's uncompromising struggle against this oppression.

Xie Zhen and Xie Bao were originally honest hunters. They went to Mao Taigong's house only to negotiate the return of a tiger they had painstakingly hunted for days. Unexpectedly, Mao Taigong claimed the tiger for himself, and instead had them tied up and sent to the court, falsely accusing them of robbery, and bribing the prison officials to nearly poison them to death. This series of frame-ups and conspiracies opened their eyes, making them see the extreme ruthlessness and hatred of the rulers towards them, "forcing them to Liangshan," and leading them on the path of revenge and resistance. This is a story generalized from thousands of similar events in the historical environment of that time.

The script prominently displays the spirit of integrity, unyieldingness, and clear distinction between right and wrong of ancient people's heroes, and their intolerance of bad people and bad deeds. These characters all possess a strong sense of justice. Some of them may be jailers or military officers in the yamen (government office), but their emotions and temperament belong to the people. They hate evil as much as they hate the enemy. Seeing people bullying others, they cannot help but feel indignant. This is a political feeling. They have a heartfelt sympathy for the good people who are being oppressed, even if they do not know them. When they saw Xie Zhen and Xie Bao wrongly imprisoned, Le He went to deliver a message, Sun Li went to plead for them, Gu Dasao planned the rescue, and Zou Yuan and Zou Run also came to help. This is precisely the spirit of "drawing a knife to help when you see injustice on the road" that ancient folk writers enthusiastically praised. This "righteousness" demonstrates the deep class love of the ancient working people. It was by relying on this "righteousness" that they united and won the victory in the struggle to break into the prison and rebel.

The playwright also enthusiastically praised heroes such as Gu Dasao and Le He. Gu Dasao is enthusiastic, brave, and bold. She displays strong hatred and contempt for the yamen and the yamen's lackeys, such as Bao Si and Shen Wu; and she demonstrates deep concern and a proactive attitude in rescuing Xie Zhen and Xie Bao's case. Le He is also portrayed as enthusiastic and righteous. He anxiously runs around to deliver messages to Gu Dasao in order to rescue Xie Zhen and Xie Bao. His enthusiasm, which treats other people's affairs as his own, is vividly depicted. The unyielding and awe-inspiring image of Xie Zhen and Xie Bao in the court scene is handled prominently. The play adopts the traditional satirical techniques of opera art to depict some negative characters. For example, the scene where Bao Si and Shen Wu go to Gu Dasao's inn to "set up a case" and are ridiculed by Gu Dasao; the scene where Bao Jiejii and Liu Er prepare to use torture on Xie Zhen and Xie Bao in prison, but are instead disarmed and beaten by the two, and end up in a mess; and the ugly state of the prefect who hears that someone is breaking into the prison, rushes onto the stage holding the official seal, and almost forgets the seal, are all ruthless mockeries of these "outwardly fierce but inwardly weak" reactionary rulers. This satire guides the audience to despise those rulers who ride on the backs of the people and act like overlords, and also demonstrates the working people's fearlessness, wit, and humorous optimism.

In terms of performance, the China Peking Opera Troupe, by strictly implementing the director system, and because the director grasped the basic spirit of the original play and enriched and developed it, has a relatively complete set of designs on the stage, highlighting the characters that should be highlighted and the scenes that should be highlighted, giving the whole play a relatively complete and harmonious artistic atmosphere. This attitude of everyone working together to perform a play well should be affirmed.

Many actors have obviously put in a lot of effort in creating their characters. For example, Yun Yanming's portrayal of Gu Dasao breaks away from the general range of Hua Dan (young female roles) or bold female roles. Her "Gu Dasao" is performed as bold without losing her kindness, witty without losing her boldness, and daring without losing her feminine gentleness. She expresses concern for Xie Zhen and Xie Bao as their cousin, and speaks to Bao Si and Shen Wu with cold words and a very tough attitude. Many small details show that her understanding of the character is meticulous. For example, when Le He first comes to the store to deliver a message, she puts on a stern face when she sees that he is dressed as a yamen runner and says: "There's no one here!" Le He casually says: "I'm looking for the inner shopkeeper." She immediately changes her face, scaring Le He into hiding. When Le He reveals his name, she suddenly says: "Ah, so you are Brother Le He,..." She says these words with a smiling face. This momentary change in expression clearly shows Gu Dasao's distinct love and hate, and her bold and straightforward character. The shortcoming is that she has too much boldness and not enough simplicity. The scene where she forces Sun Li seems too sharp and ruthless, and too aggressive. Zhang Chunhua's portrayal of Le He maintains a full emotional state throughout the performance. His several hurried trips to deliver messages to Gu Dasao, and his several exit gestures, demonstrate the character's eagerness to help his friends. He combines Le He's lively and humorous personality with a sense of justice very well. For example, when he sees Liu Er poisoning Xie Zhen and Xie Bao in prison, he deliberately shouts and makes a scene, pretending to be following Bao Jiejii's orders not to allow private food deliveries to prisoners with a "matter of public duty" face, but it also makes people feel that there is also genuine anger towards Liu Er. He portrays Le He as enthusiastic and righteous, giving people a complete impression of a fearless and resourceful young man. Zhang Yunxi's portrayal of Xie Zhen and Shen Jinqi's portrayal of Xie Bao both grasp the simple and unyielding character of the working people, and successfully portray the two immature (and therefore inexperienced) heroes. However, Zhang Yunxi portrays Xie Zhen's relatively calm and careful character as bordering on timidity (such as in the court scene); Shen Jinqi, in some places, portrays Xie Bao's straightforwardness as somewhat rash, such as when going to Mao Taigong's house to demand the tiger, he shows hostility towards Mao Taigong before even seeing the tiger in the backyard, which is not very appropriate. Overall, the actors all have artistic creativity. The fact that the actors can break away from the outdated idea of "leading roles" and "supporting roles" and engage in collective artistic creation under the unified command of the director is an important factor in the success of this play.

The performance of this play has many relatively systematic reforms, such as eliminating the characters' "announcements," "introductions," and "entrance poems," and using scenery in all but a very few scenes. These reforms are welcome. Some of the scenery is used very well, such as the scenes of "the court," "the prison," and "Mao Taigong's house," all of which create the appropriate stage atmosphere and complement the actors' performance. Of course, the contradiction between the scenery and the inherent performance forms of opera is not resolved well in every scene. For example, in the "Hunting the Tiger" scene, the hunters climb the mountain for a long time, but the scenery remains in the same place, and the hunters do not pull the grass looking for tiger footprints from grassy spot on the stage, but instead from the spot with no grass, which are all minor flaws. These are some of the problems that are bound to be encountered in opera reform, and cannot be solved all at once, but can only be solved gradually in the continuous practice of reform.

Many viewers feel that the first scene, "Birthday Celebration," is like a spoken drama. This is because when acting in front of the scenery, the actors are not daring to use exaggerated movements, thus excessively weakening the dance element (which is one of the basic characteristics of Peking Opera movements), while some other scenes have very strong dance elements, making the overall performance style of the play not very unified. Another point is that the scenes before "claiming the tiger dishonestly" are too long. The conflict in the play starts with Mao Taigong claiming the tiger dishonestly. If the conflict is not developed for a long time at the beginning, the audience will not understand the author's intention, and the continuous scenes of hunters expressing a lack of confidence in hunting the tiger will make the stage mood depressed and monotonous. Generally speaking, hunters should not be against hunting tigers. This is their livelihood on which their food and clothing depends. The prefect's order for the hunters to go up the mountain to hunt the ferocious tiger that often injures people is still in line with the interests of the people (only the "time limit" is an expression of autocratic tyranny). The play portrays the heroic profession of hunter as being afraid of hunger and cold, crestfallen, and even falling and injuring their feet while climbing the mountain, which greatly diminishes the heroism. Describing a person's passive attitude towards life does not constitute a heroic image.

In addition, the description of the act of rebellion in the characters' minds is not serious enough. Many characters talk about this matter with an attitude that seems somewhat relaxed, even close to pleasant (such as in the "planning" scene). In reality, people cannot discuss rebellion with such a mood. At that time, the power of the reactionary rulers was so great that rebellion was by no means a sure thing. A slight miscalculation could lead to decapitation. Sun Li was right when he said: "Breaking into prison and rebelling is no small matter!" Therefore, the act of rebellion should be written as a serious, life-threatening issue for everyone, a serious test. If the seriousness of the act of rebellion is not emphasized, it will be difficult to express the heroes' spirit of "sacrificing oneself for righteousness" (even if no one is actually sacrificed). Many works have the same tendency on this issue: portraying the uprising as too easy, portraying the environment at the time as not very difficult or dangerous, and portraying the reactionary rulers as weak and incompetent. Such writing is not only untrue, but it also fails to highlight the strong will and courageous character that the insurgents needed to resolutely rise up under such difficult circumstances.

This play reflects such a turbulent historical era at the end of the Northern Song Dynasty: the tyranny of the officials, the shamelessness of the landlords, the collusion and dog-like behavior of the clerks, the suffering and resentment of the working people... but before all of this is the generosity, loftiness, and unyielding spirit of several heroes. On the stage, this spirit overshadows all the baseness and shamelessness, and shows the integrity and inviolability of the working people. The development of the events shows that it is precisely these people's unyielding will that makes history submit to them. Such a depiction of history is basically correct and educational. Expressing the face of history from a revolutionary point of view should be the main task of historical (or legendary) opera. There are already too many love stories in our newly compiled and adapted opera works. Opera playwrights should create works with more diverse and educational themes, and should more and better portray the arduous labor and struggle that the ancient people paid to change history, in order to inspire the revolutionary spirit and creative will of the masses.

    谈京剧“猎虎记”及其演出
    张真
    编剧：范钧宏  导演：樊放中国京剧团演出
    “猎虎记”是近来以古代人民生活为题材的改编戏曲中较好的一个京剧剧目。剧本根据“水浒”第四十九回的故事，描写了两个年青的猎人解珍、解宝怎样遭受地主和官僚的陷害；描写了几个具有英雄气质的人物——当狱卒的乐和，开酒店的孙新、顾大嫂夫妇，登云山头领邹渊、邹闰，及登州兵马提辖孙立等人——怎样打抱不平，劫牢救出解珍、解宝，同奔梁山泊聚义的经过。这个戏反映了那个时代封建统治者与人民之间的阶级矛盾，暴露了封建统治阶级的狠毒和无耻，刻划了良善人民在残酷压迫下的痛苦，也比较细致地描写了人民对这种压迫所采取的不妥协的斗争的曲折过程。
    解珍、解宝本来是两个老实猎户，他们到毛太公家，只是为了交涉取回他们辛苦数日所打死的一只老虎，不料毛太公把虎赖去，反把他们捆送公堂，诬为打抢，又贿通狱吏，几乎把他们毒死。这一连串的陷害和阴谋，使他们眼睛明亮，看清了统治者对自己的极端狠毒和仇恨，把他们“逼上梁山”，使他们走上了复仇反抗的路。这是从当时的历史环境中千百个相似的事件中概括出来的一段故事。
    剧本突出地表现了古代人民英雄的正直不屈、是非分明的精神和他们对坏人与坏事不能容忍的精神。这些人物都是具有强烈的正义感的，他们有的虽然在衙门里当狱卒或军官，但他们的感情、气质却是属于人民的，他们嫉恶如仇，看到人欺负人的事，就忍不住义愤填胸。这是一种政治感情。他们对被欺压的良善人民，尽管不相识，却发生由衷的同情。看到解珍、解宝冤枉入狱，乐和就去送信，孙立就去讲情，顾大嫂筹划营救，邹渊、邹闰也来帮忙，这正是古来人民作家所热情歌颂的“路见不平，拔刀相助”的义气。这“义气”表现了古代劳动人民的深厚的阶级友爱，就是靠着这种“义气”，他们才团结一致，赢得了劫牢反狱斗争的胜利。
    剧作者也热情地歌颂了顾大嫂、乐和等几个英雄人物。顾大嫂热情、勇敢、泼辣，对当时的衙门和衙门里的狗腿子如鲍四、沈五之流，表现了强烈的憎恨和鄙视；而对解珍、解宝的案件，却表现了深切的关怀和积极援救的态度。乐和这人物也被表现得热情、仗义，为了营救解珍、解宝，他焦急奔走，那种把别人的事情看做自己事情的热心肠，是刻划得鲜明的。解珍、解宝在公堂一场的不屈服的正气凛然的形象，是处理得突出的。戏中对一些反面人物采取了戏曲艺术中传统的讽刺的手法，例如鲍四、沈五到顾大嫂酒店去“挂桩办案”、被顾大嫂冷嘲热讽的一场；例如在狱中包节级、刘二准备用私刑打解珍、解宝，反被两人夺过棍子打了几下，狼狈下场的一场；以及知府听说有人劫狱、抱着大印慌慌张张地上场又下场、几乎忘了印的丑态，都是对于这些“色厉内荏”的反动统治者的无情的嘲笑。这种讽刺引导观众去鄙视那些骑在人民头上，作威作福的统治者，也表现了劳动人民的大无畏气概和机智、幽默的乐观主义精神。
    中国京剧团在演出上，由于严格地执行了导演制度，由于导演掌握了原剧的基本精神，并从而加以充实和发挥，舞台上有一套比较完整的设计，突出了该突出的人物、该突出的场子，使全剧有一种比较完整、比较谐和一致的艺术气氛。这种全体协同一致演好一个戏的态度，是应该肯定的。
    很多演员在创造人物上，显然也是下了功夫的。例如云燕铭的顾大嫂的形象，就脱出了一般的花旦或泼辣旦的范围。她的“顾大嫂”演得泼辣而不失其善良，机警而不失其豪放，敢作敢为而不失其女性的温柔。她对解珍、解宝表现了表姐的关切，对鲍四、沈五则冷言冷语，十分强硬。许多小地方可看出她体会人物性格是细致的，例如乐和初次到店中送信时，她一见是衙役打扮，就放下脸来说：“店里没人！”乐和信口说：“我找内掌柜的。”她一听登时就要变脸，吓的乐和直躲。等乐和说出自己姓名时，她恍然说：“啊，原来您就是乐和兄弟啊，……”这一段话她说得满面春风。这一刹那间表情的变化，把顾大嫂爱憎分明、豪放爽快的性格，表现得十分明显。缺点是泼辣有余，质朴不足，在逼孙立一场就显得过于尖酸冷酷，咄咄逼人。张春华扮演的乐和，通场都保持着饱满的情绪。几次匆匆来给顾大嫂送信，几个下场姿势，表现了这个人物为朋友奔走迫不及待的热情。他把乐和活泼诙谐的个性与正义感结合得很好，比如在狱中看到刘二下毒要害解珍、解宝时，他故意大呼大叫，闹了一场，虽然装做奉了包节级之命，不准给犯人私下送饭的“公事公办”的面孔，却使人感到同时也有着对刘二的真正的愤怒。他把乐和演得热情、义气，给人一个天不怕地不怕、精明强悍的小伙子的完整印象。张云溪扮演的解珍，沈金启扮演的解宝，都掌握了劳动人民的朴实和倔强的性格，成功地表现了两个未成熟的（因而是无经验的）英雄人物。但是张云溪把解珍的较沉着、细心的性格表现得近于胆怯（如公堂一场）；沈金启在有些地方又把解宝的直爽表现得有些毛躁，如去毛太公家索虎时，还没到后花园看虎，竟先表现出对毛太公的敌意，都是不很妥当的。总起来说，演员们大都有着艺术上的创造。演员们能打破“主角”、“配角”的陈旧的想法，在导演的统一指挥下，进行集体的艺术创造，这是使这个戏演出成功的一个重要因素。
    这个戏的演出有很多比较系统的改革，如取消了角色“报名”、“引子”、“上场诗”等，并除了极少数场面，都采用了布景。这种改革是值得欢迎的。有些布景用得很好，如“公堂”、“监狱”、
  “毛太公家”等几景，都造成应有的舞台气氛，衬托了演员的表演。当然，布景与戏曲固有表演形式之间的矛盾，并不是每场都解决得很好的，如“猎虎”一场，猎户们爬了半天山，景却还在原地，并且猎户们不在有草的地方，偏在没草的地方拨草寻找虎的踪迹，都是小小的破绽。这是一些在戏曲改革中所必然会碰到、而又不可能一下子就解决的问题，只能在改革的不断实践中逐步解决。
    有很多观众觉得第一场“祝寿”像话剧，这是由于在布景前做戏，演员不大敢用夸张的动作，因而过份减弱了舞蹈性（这是京剧动作的基本特征之一），而另外有几场戏舞蹈性又很强，使全剧表演风格不甚统一。另一点是“赖虎”以前的戏太长。剧中的矛盾是从毛太公赖虎起的，开场许久不展开矛盾，就会使观众不明作者意图，并且在接连几场中渲染了猎户对于猎虎没有信心的冷淡态度，也使舞台上情绪低沉、单调。一般说来，猎户应该是不会反对猎虎的，这是他们衣食所系的营生，知府命猎户上山去猎那只时常伤人的猛虎，也还是符合人民利益的（只是“杖限”是专制淫威的表现），戏中把猎户这种带有英雄色彩的职业，描写得怕饿怕冷，垂头丧气，甚至于爬山时掉下来伤了脚，都大大使英雄减色。描写一个人对生活的被动态度，是构成不了英雄形象的。
    此外，造反这一件事在剧中人心理上描写得不够沉重，许多人物谈到这事时，态度表现得有些轻松，甚至近于愉快（如“定计”一场），实际上，人是不能怀着那样心情来谈论造反的。当时反动统治者的力量那么大，造反决不是有把握的事情，一点考虑不周就要掉头的，孙立说的对：“劫牢反狱，非同小可！”因此，造反一举对每个人应该写成是一个严重的、生命所系的问题，一个严重的考验，不强调造反一事的严重性，就难以表现英雄们的“舍身取义”（即便结果没有人牺牲）的慷慨壮烈的精神。有不少作品在这一问题上都有同样的倾向：把起义描写得过分容易，把当时环境描写得不很艰难，不很危险，把反动统治者描写得软弱无能，这样写不但是不真实的，而且也不能突出起义者在那样艰难形势之下决然起义所需要的坚强的意志和勇敢的性格。
    这个戏反映了北宋末年那样一个动乱的历史时代：当时官府的淫威，地主的无赖，吏胥的朋比为奸、狗头狗脑，劳动人民的痛苦和愤懑……但在这一切背景之前的，是若干英雄的慷慨轩昂，不屈不挠的气魄。在舞台上，这气魄盖过了那一切的卑鄙与无耻，显出了劳动人民的正直和不可侮。事件的发展，表明了正是这些人们的不屈的意志，使历史服从了他们。这样的对历史的描写，基本是正确的和具有教育意义的。按照革命的观点去表现历史的面貌，应该是历史题材（或传说题材）戏曲的主要任务。现在我们新编的和改编的戏曲作品中，已经有太多的爱情故事了，戏曲剧作家们应该创作出主题更多样更富于教育性的作品来，应该更多地，并且更好地去表现古代人民为改变历史而付出的艰巨的劳动和斗争，以鼓舞群众的革命精神和创造意志。
