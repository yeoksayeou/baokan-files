Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

After listening to the statements made at this conference regarding our proposal, we believe it is necessary to respond to some of the statements and questions, and to provide supplementary explanations for individual clauses of our proposal, which is of great significance in drafting a resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

I would like to reiterate here the illegality of the United Nations resolution adopted on October 7, 1950.

On April 27, our delegation submitted to this conference a proposal on restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections for this purpose, and submitted it to the conference for discussion. Our proposal advocates that the peaceful settlement of the Korean question should be handled by the Korean people themselves. Holding national elections should be an important step towards realizing Korean unification.

To hold free all-Korean elections, we proposed the establishment of an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea. One of the primary tasks of this committee should be to take steps to ensure truly democratic elections under conditions of complete freedom without any foreign interference. Furthermore, the tasks of this committee should include taking urgent countermeasures in the economic and cultural aspects that are of practical concern to the entire Korean people.

In view of the fact that the presence of foreign troops in Korea will inevitably lead to foreign interference in Korean internal affairs, our proposal suggests that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Korea within six months. Of course, other opinions on the withdrawal deadline can be reconsidered. Representatives of the United States and several other countries, who participated in the armed intervention against our country and turned our country into ruins, opposed the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea in their speeches. They attempt to hinder the peaceful reunification of Korea and use Korea as an imperialist base of aggression against the People's Republic of China, consolidating their position as interventionists. In order to deceive public opinion, they put forward fabricated arguments, saying that the withdrawal of American troops will cause the Korean War to restart. The American representative put forward a strange argument as another reason for refusing to withdraw its troops from Korea, saying that if the American troops were to return to Korea, the distance would be too far. To this we can answer: The Korean people demand that the occupiers leave our country as soon as possible, and even more so do not want them to return. I would like to further point out on the issue of guaranteeing the security of Korea: It is not accidental that the American representative disregards the third clause of the proposal of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The third clause of our proposal suggests that it is necessary for the corresponding countries that are most concerned about peace in the Far East to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and thus it is necessary to create conditions to promote the task of peacefully unifying Korea into a democratic country as soon as possible. Our delegation has no doubt that if all participants in the conference truly wish to help the Korean people to avoid the recurrence of war, then the countries participating in the conference must reach an agreement with each other on various countermeasures to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and prevent the recurrence of military actions. Our delegation believes that great powers can play a particularly important role in this work and should assume the definite obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and non-interference in its internal affairs based on agreements between the great powers.

If the United States, as the U.S. Secretary of State said, truly has no political and economic desires for Korea, then there is no reason for the American troops and the troops of other countries to continue to stay in the Korean region, and even less reason not to assume the obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea.

For three years, the Korean people have endured great sacrifices and difficulties in the forced bloody war. We believe that no Korean people, except those who value the interests and prestige of their foreign masters more than their own country's interests, hope for another war. The starting point of our proposal is to unify our country into a single, independent, and democratic country, and to eliminate the possibility of the recurrence of the Korean War, which is a matter of life and death for the Korean people.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly believes that this position on the Korean issue is the most correct. Because this position is in line with the national interests of the Korean people and helps to consolidate peace in the Far East. We are very pleased with the support of our proposal from the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. It must be pointed out that the American representative and the delegations of several other countries hastily rejected our proposal. The American delegation actually stated that the United States can only settle the Korean issue according to the conditions it demands. Mr. Dulles opposed granting the Korean people the inherent right to manage their own internal affairs. The American representative proposed holding elections only in North Korea, and that the Chinese People's Volunteers should be withdrawn from the North Korean region, and that this election must be held under the supervision of the United Nations and the South Korean government. However, even the Australian representative had to admit the legitimacy of our suggestion to hold elections in both North and South Korea. It is not difficult to understand that the essence of the American proposal is an attempt to extend the anti-people political system established by the United States in South Korea to the North Korean region. What are the arguments against our proposal to hold all-Korean elections without the observation and supervision of foreign committees? The American representative and the South Korean representative, as well as some other representatives, opposed it on the grounds that free elections have already been held in South Korea, and therefore the holding of all-Korean elections would undermine the prestige of the United Nations and the authority of the South Korean government. Obviously, what they are considering is not the interests of the Korean people, but simply fear of reducing the "prestige" of the interventionists and their running dogs. The statement that the South Korean people had the opportunity to freely express their will in 1948 is completely inconsistent with the facts.

In our speech on April 27, we have already quoted a section from the 59th communiqu√© of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, which recognized the anti-democratic nature of the separate elections held in South Korea on May 10, 1948. This election was conducted under conditions of brutal police violence, terror, and blatant suppression against voters. This is a fact known to the world, and the stationing of American troops in South Korea further fueled this situation.

Everyone knows that American warships came to various ports in South Korea before the election. The American occupation authorities mobilized all of the more than 60,000 police during the election, armed many terrorist groups, and mobilized their land and air forces to take combat deployments. On May 9, the eve of the election, South Korea declared a state of war. Every village was guarded by American troops, and machine guns were deployed at central intersections. The separate elections in South Korea in 1948 were held in this environment. Obviously, this election was anti-democratic. This election certainly cannot be considered a free expression of the will of the South Korean residents. Many facts prove the anti-democratic nature of the political system established by the United States in South Korea.

We can cite reports from foreign journalists who can by no means be considered sympathetic to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. For example, the "Chicago Sun-Times" correspondent in Busan wrote on December 30, 1952: "South Korea is a police state, a country shrouded in terror. What the people fear is not hunger, war, and disease, they fear the police and officials and each other. The 64,000 police have unlimited rights to arrest, detain, and torture at will, and they exercise this right wantonly... According to reports from Daejeon and other places, when people made critical speeches of Syngman Rhee at mass rallies, those who applauded were arrested afterwards."

Hayward, a reporter for the American "Christian Science Monitor," reported in June 1952: "The American and British diplomatic representatives who were invited to participate in the conference as observers had to cross the windows and hurriedly ran out of the venue. The police's suppression and the indulgence of terror made it clear to the foreign media representatives attending the conference that South Korea is far from democracy and the constitution."

A Reuters reporter in Busan reported on May 30, 1952: The South Korean Vice President pointed out in his letter of resignation, "It is a shameful thing to see my name on the list of the bureaucratic, dictatorial, and corrupt Syngman Rhee government."

Because there are so many such facts, even the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, which supports the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea and obviously takes an unfair position, cannot deny this fact. The report submitted by the committee to the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations also acknowledged the reports of foreign observers I cited regarding the anti-democratic nature of the Syngman Rhee political system.

The founders of this political system know that they can only maintain their political system with the help of foreign troops. Therefore, the rulers of South Korea are desperately holding on to American bayonets and resolutely opposing the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea.

The United States, South Korea, and some other representatives attempted to shirk the responsibility of the United States and South Korea for the Korean War and the responsibility of the United States for launching armed intervention before the United Nations adopted a resolution. This attempt is unjustified.

On this issue, the discussions in the United Nations General Assembly and the documents of the South Korean government published in the newspapers and presented to the United Nations General Assembly prove that the war was imposed on the Korean people from the outside, and the United States should bear special responsibility for this. The attack on North Korea was being prepared by South Korea under American protection long before the outbreak of the war. I would like to cite a letter from Syngman Rhee to his advisor, American Professor Dr. Oliver, on September 30, 1949. In this letter, Syngman Rhee wrote: "I think now is the most suitable psychological moment to take offensive steps... We want to drive Kim Il-sung's gang into the mountains and let them slowly starve to death there."

The fact that the South Korean army frequently attacked our guard posts along the 38th parallel before the start of the Korean War is also well known throughout the world. These attacks caused large-scale military conflicts. Between January and September 1949 alone, there were as many as 431 incidents of attacks by the South Korean army.

I would like to remind everyone of an important matter. The strategic map in the secret archives of the Syngman Rhee government has been captured by us and is now in the hands of my government and has been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. This map clearly proves that the plan to attack North Korea was prepared long before the start of the war. These many facts truthfully prove that the responsibility for the Korean War, which has continued for more than three years, lies entirely with the United States and the Syngman Rhee regime in South Korea.

As is well known, after the failure of Syngman Rhee's military actions of aggression against North Korea, the Syngman Rhee gang is still clamoring every day to impose its political system on North Korea by force, clamoring to "northward advance" again. But there is no doubt that if the Syngman Rhee gang dares to launch another war, the Korean people will give the aggressors an even more decisive blow. The crazy speech made by the South Korean representative today is not worth refuting. He wants to use it to hide the darkness of South Korea and the anti-democratic nature of the South Korean political system. His speech is of no help to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The Australian representative asked for clarification on several issues related to the composition of the all-Korean committee, especially the issue of the number of representatives from North and South Korea. The composition of the committee takes into account the agreement between the two sides, so the issue of the number of members of the All-Korean Committee cannot become a complicated issue. Procedural issues and other issues should be resolved through agreements between the two sides. The Australian representative expressed great concern that the committee would encounter great difficulties in its work. Of course, we have not failed to estimate that there will be considerable difficulties in our future. But we believe that these difficulties can be overcome. There is no doubt that if the settlement of the Korean issue is handed over to the Koreans themselves and foreign interference in our internal affairs is eliminated, the Koreans will surely overcome all difficulties and exert full strength and determination to establish a unified, independent, and democratic country.
