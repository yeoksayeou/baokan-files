Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

After listening to the statements made at this conference regarding our proposal, we believe it is necessary to respond to some of the statements and questions, and to provide supplementary explanations for individual clauses of our proposal, which is of great significance in drafting a resolution on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

I would like to reiterate here the illegality of the United Nations resolution adopted on October 7, 1950.

On April 27, our delegation submitted to this conference a proposal on restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free all-Korean elections for this purpose, and submitted it to the conference for discussion. Our proposal advocates that the peaceful settlement of the Korean question should be handled by the Korean people themselves. Holding national elections should be an important step towards realizing Korean unification.

To hold free all-Korean elections, we proposed the establishment of an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea. One of the primary tasks of this committee should be to take steps to ensure truly democratic elections under conditions of complete freedom without any foreign interference. Furthermore, the tasks of this committee should include taking urgent countermeasures in the economic and cultural aspects that are of practical concern to the entire Korean people.

In view of the fact that the presence of foreign troops in Korea will inevitably lead to foreign interference in Korean internal affairs, our proposal suggests that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Korea within six months. Of course, other opinions on the withdrawal deadline can be reconsidered. Representatives of the United States and several other countries, who participated in the armed intervention against our country and turned our country into ruins, opposed the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea in their speeches. They attempt to hinder the peaceful reunification of Korea and use Korea as an imperialist base of aggression against the People's Republic of China, consolidating their position as interventionists. In order to deceive public opinion, they put forward fabricated arguments, saying that the withdrawal of American troops will cause the Korean War to restart. The American representative put forward a strange argument as another reason for refusing to withdraw its troops from Korea, saying that if the American troops were to return to Korea, the distance would be too far. To this we can answer: The Korean people demand that the occupiers leave our country as soon as possible, and even more so do not want them to return. I would like to further point out on the issue of guaranteeing the security of Korea: It is not accidental that the American representative disregards the third clause of the proposal of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The third clause of our proposal suggests that it is necessary for the corresponding countries that are most concerned about peace in the Far East to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and thus it is necessary to create conditions to promote the task of peacefully unifying Korea into a democratic country as soon as possible. Our delegation has no doubt that if all participants in the conference truly wish to help the Korean people to avoid the recurrence of war, then the countries participating in the conference must reach an agreement with each other on various countermeasures to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and prevent the recurrence of military actions. Our delegation believes that great powers can play a particularly important role in this work and should assume the definite obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea and non-interference in its internal affairs based on agreements between the great powers.

If the United States, as the U.S. Secretary of State said, truly has no political and economic desires for Korea, then there is no reason for the American troops and the troops of other countries to continue to stay in the Korean region, and even less reason not to assume the obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea.

For three years, the Korean people have endured great sacrifices and difficulties in the forced bloody war. We believe that no Korean people, except those who value the interests and prestige of their foreign masters more than their own country's interests, hope for another war. The starting point of our proposal is to unify our country into a single, independent, and democratic country, and to eliminate the possibility of the recurrence of the Korean War, which is a matter of life and death for the Korean people.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly believes that this position on the Korean issue is the most correct. Because this position is in line with the national interests of the Korean people and helps to consolidate peace in the Far East. We are very pleased with the support of our proposal from the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. It must be pointed out that the American representative and the delegations of several other countries hastily rejected our proposal. The American delegation actually stated that the United States can only settle the Korean issue according to the conditions it demands. Mr. Dulles opposed granting the Korean people the inherent right to manage their own internal affairs. The American representative proposed holding elections only in North Korea, and that the Chinese People's Volunteers should be withdrawn from the North Korean region, and that this election must be held under the supervision of the United Nations and the South Korean government. However, even the Australian representative had to admit the legitimacy of our suggestion to hold elections in both North and South Korea. It is not difficult to understand that the essence of the American proposal is an attempt to extend the anti-people political system established by the United States in South Korea to the North Korean region. What are the arguments against our proposal to hold all-Korean elections without the observation and supervision of foreign committees? The American representative and the South Korean representative, as well as some other representatives, opposed it on the grounds that free elections have already been held in South Korea, and therefore the holding of all-Korean elections would undermine the prestige of the United Nations and the authority of the South Korean government. Obviously, what they are considering is not the interests of the Korean people, but simply fear of reducing the "prestige" of the interventionists and their running dogs. The statement that the South Korean people had the opportunity to freely express their will in 1948 is completely inconsistent with the facts.

In our speech on April 27, we have already quoted a section from the 59th communiqué of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, which recognized the anti-democratic nature of the separate elections held in South Korea on May 10, 1948. This election was conducted under conditions of brutal police violence, terror, and blatant suppression against voters. This is a fact known to the world, and the stationing of American troops in South Korea further fueled this situation.

Everyone knows that American warships came to various ports in South Korea before the election. The American occupation authorities mobilized all of the more than 60,000 police during the election, armed many terrorist groups, and mobilized their land and air forces to take combat deployments. On May 9, the eve of the election, South Korea declared a state of war. Every village was guarded by American troops, and machine guns were deployed at central intersections. The separate elections in South Korea in 1948 were held in this environment. Obviously, this election was anti-democratic. This election certainly cannot be considered a free expression of the will of the South Korean residents. Many facts prove the anti-democratic nature of the political system established by the United States in South Korea.

We can cite reports from foreign journalists who can by no means be considered sympathetic to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. For example, the "Chicago Sun-Times" correspondent in Busan wrote on December 30, 1952: "South Korea is a police state, a country shrouded in terror. What the people fear is not hunger, war, and disease, they fear the police and officials and each other. The 64,000 police have unlimited rights to arrest, detain, and torture at will, and they exercise this right wantonly... According to reports from Daejeon and other places, when people made critical speeches of Syngman Rhee at mass rallies, those who applauded were arrested afterwards."

Hayward, a reporter for the American "Christian Science Monitor," reported in June 1952: "The American and British diplomatic representatives who were invited to participate in the conference as observers had to cross the windows and hurriedly ran out of the venue. The police's suppression and the indulgence of terror made it clear to the foreign media representatives attending the conference that South Korea is far from democracy and the constitution."

A Reuters reporter in Busan reported on May 30, 1952: The South Korean Vice President pointed out in his letter of resignation, "It is a shameful thing to see my name on the list of the bureaucratic, dictatorial, and corrupt Syngman Rhee government."

Because there are so many such facts, even the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, which supports the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea and obviously takes an unfair position, cannot deny this fact. The report submitted by the committee to the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations also acknowledged the reports of foreign observers I cited regarding the anti-democratic nature of the Syngman Rhee political system.

The founders of this political system know that they can only maintain their political system with the help of foreign troops. Therefore, the rulers of South Korea are desperately holding on to American bayonets and resolutely opposing the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea.

The United States, South Korea, and some other representatives attempted to shirk the responsibility of the United States and South Korea for the Korean War and the responsibility of the United States for launching armed intervention before the United Nations adopted a resolution. This attempt is unjustified.

On this issue, the discussions in the United Nations General Assembly and the documents of the South Korean government published in the newspapers and presented to the United Nations General Assembly prove that the war was imposed on the Korean people from the outside, and the United States should bear special responsibility for this. The attack on North Korea was being prepared by South Korea under American protection long before the outbreak of the war. I would like to cite a letter from Syngman Rhee to his advisor, American Professor Dr. Oliver, on September 30, 1949. In this letter, Syngman Rhee wrote: "I think now is the most suitable psychological moment to take offensive steps... We want to drive Kim Il-sung's gang into the mountains and let them slowly starve to death there."

The fact that the South Korean army frequently attacked our guard posts along the 38th parallel before the start of the Korean War is also well known throughout the world. These attacks caused large-scale military conflicts. Between January and September 1949 alone, there were as many as 431 incidents of attacks by the South Korean army.

I would like to remind everyone of an important matter. The strategic map in the secret archives of the Syngman Rhee government has been captured by us and is now in the hands of my government and has been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. This map clearly proves that the plan to attack North Korea was prepared long before the start of the war. These many facts truthfully prove that the responsibility for the Korean War, which has continued for more than three years, lies entirely with the United States and the Syngman Rhee regime in South Korea.

As is well known, after the failure of Syngman Rhee's military actions of aggression against North Korea, the Syngman Rhee gang is still clamoring every day to impose its political system on North Korea by force, clamoring to "northward advance" again. But there is no doubt that if the Syngman Rhee gang dares to launch another war, the Korean people will give the aggressors an even more decisive blow. The crazy speech made by the South Korean representative today is not worth refuting. He wants to use it to hide the darkness of South Korea and the anti-democratic nature of the South Korean political system. His speech is of no help to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The Australian representative asked for clarification on several issues related to the composition of the all-Korean committee, especially the issue of the number of representatives from North and South Korea. The composition of the committee takes into account the agreement between the two sides, so the issue of the number of members of the All-Korean Committee cannot become a complicated issue. Procedural issues and other issues should be resolved through agreements between the two sides. The Australian representative expressed great concern that the committee would encounter great difficulties in its work. Of course, we have not failed to estimate that there will be considerable difficulties in our future. But we believe that these difficulties can be overcome. There is no doubt that if the settlement of the Korean issue is handed over to the Koreans themselves and foreign interference in our internal affairs is eliminated, the Koreans will surely overcome all difficulties and exert full strength and determination to establish a unified, independent, and democratic country.

### 在日内瓦会议五月三日会议上  南日外务相的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议五月三日会议上
    南日外务相的发言主席先生、各位代表：
    我们在听取了就我方方案在本会议上所作的发言后，认为有必要回答一部分发言和问题，并有必要对我们的在草拟关于和平调整朝鲜问题的决议上具有重要意义的方案的个别条款作补充说明。
    我要在这里重申联合国在一九五零年十月七日通过的决议的非法性。
    四月二十七日，本代表团向本会议提出了关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一，并为此目的举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案并提交会议讨论。我们的方案主张应把以和平方式调整朝鲜问题一事交给朝鲜人民自己处理。举行全国选举应成为实现朝鲜统一的重要步骤。
    为举行全朝鲜自由选举，我们提议以南北朝鲜代表组成全朝鲜委员会。该委员会的首要任务之一就是应采取步骤以保证在没有任何外国干涉的完全自由的条件下，举行真正民主的选举。并且，该委员会的任务应包括在全朝鲜人民所切实关心的经济及文化方面采取紧要对策。
    鉴于外国军队驻扎朝鲜必将造成外国对朝鲜内政的干涉，我们的方案提议在六个月内，自朝鲜境内撤出一切外国军队。对于撤退期限如有其他意见，当然可以重新考虑。参加了对我国的武装干涉，使我国成为废墟的美国及其他若干国家的代表们，在自己的发言中反对自朝鲜境内撤出外国军队。他们企图阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并利用朝鲜作为反对中华人民共和国的帝国主义侵略基地，巩固其干涉者的地位。他们为了欺骗社会舆论提出了捏造的论据，说什么美国军队的撤退将引起朝鲜战争的重起。美国代表提出了古怪的论点作为拒绝自朝鲜撤退其军队的另一个理由，说什么如果美军重新回到朝鲜的话，相距太远。对此我们可以回答：朝鲜人民要求强占者尽速离开我国，更不希望他们重新回来。我愿就保证朝鲜的安全问题进一步指出：美国代表漠视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团方案的第三款，并不是偶然的。我们的方案的第三款建议，对远东和平具有最大关心的相应国家，有必要保证朝鲜的和平发展，并从而有必要创造条件，以促使尽速完成以和平方式把朝鲜统一成为民主的国家的任务。本代表团毫无疑问地认为：如果所有参加会议的人，真正愿意帮助朝鲜人民，使之免于战争重起，那么参加会议的各国相互之间，必须对保证朝鲜的和平发展和防止军事行动重起的各种对策取得协议。我们代表团认为：大国在这一工作中能起特别重要的作用，并应负起依据大国相互间的协议，保证朝鲜的和平发展与不干涉其内政的确定的义务。
    如果美国是像美国国务卿所说的那样，对朝鲜真正没有政治及经济的欲望，那么就没有任何理由让美国军队和其他国家军队继续留在朝鲜地区，更没有理由不负起保证朝鲜和平发展的义务。
    三年来，朝鲜人民在被迫的流血战争中，经受了巨大的牺牲和困难。我们认为除了把自己的外国主子的利益和威信比本国利益更加重视的人们而外，没有一个朝鲜人希望再度发生战争。我们方案的出发点就是：统一我国成为一个单一的、独立的民主国家，消除朝鲜战争重起的可能性，而这是攸关朝鲜人民的生死问题。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团坚定地认为对朝鲜问题的这种立场是最正当的。因为这种立场符合于朝鲜人民的民族利益，并有助于巩固远东和平的。中华人民共和国代表团和苏联代表团对我们的方案的支持，使我们很感满意。不得不指出，美国代表和若干其他国家的代表团，对我们的方案加以急躁的拒绝，美国代表团实际上声称：美国只能依据自己所要求的条件，调整朝鲜问题。杜勒斯先生反对赋予朝鲜人民以调整本国内政的固有的权利。美国代表提议只在北朝鲜举行选举，并应从北朝鲜地区撤出中国人民志愿军，并且这个选举必须在联合国和南朝鲜政府监督下举行。但是，连澳大利亚代表也不得不承认，我们建议在南北朝鲜举行选举的正当性。不难了解，美国建议的本质就是企图把美国在南朝鲜树立的符合其利益的反人民的政治制度扩展到北朝鲜地区。对于我们主张在没有外国委员会的观察和监督下举行全朝鲜选举的建议，提出反对的论点是什么呢？美国代表和南朝鲜代表以及某些其他代表借口在南朝鲜已经举行了自由选举，因此全朝鲜选举的举行将有损于联合国的威望和南朝鲜政府的威信而加以反对。很显然，他们所考虑的不是朝鲜人民的利益，而只是怕降低干涉者及其走狗们的“威信”。南朝鲜人民在一九四八年有可能自由地表示其意志的说法，完全不符合事实。
    我们已经在四月二十七日的发言中引证了联合国朝鲜临时委员会的第五十九号公报里的一段，这个公报承认了一九四八年五月十日举行的南朝鲜单独选举的反民主性。这一选举是在对选民施加残暴的警察暴行、恐怖以及公然镇压的条件下进行的。这是世人所周知的事实，美国军队之驻扎南朝鲜更助长了这一情况。
    大家都知道，举行选举之前美国军舰来到了南朝鲜各港口。美国占领当局在选举时动员了所有六万多警察，武装了许多恐怖团体，动员了自己的陆空军采取战斗部署。在五月九日选举前夕，南朝鲜宣布了战争状态，每个村庄都有美国军队警备，中心十字街道上都布置了机关枪。一九四八年南朝鲜单独选举是在这种环境下举行的，很显然，这一选举是反民主的。这一选举当然不能认为是南朝鲜居民意志的自由表现。许多事实证明美国在南朝鲜树立的政治制度的反民主性质。
    我们可以引证绝不能认为对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国持有同情的外国记者的报道。例如：一九五二年十二月三十日“芝加哥太阳时报”驻釜山记者写道：“南朝鲜是警察国家，这是一个恐怖笼罩着的国家。人民所怕的不是饥寒、战争和疾病，他们所怕的是警察和官吏以及他们相互之间。六万四千警察有无限制的权利可以随便逮捕、拘禁并进行拷问，他们肆无忌惮地行使着这一权利……据来自大田及其他地方的报道，在群众集会上对李承晚做批评演说时，鼓掌的人都在事后被捕。”
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”的记者海华德一九五二年六月报道：“以观察员身份被邀参加会议的美国和英国的外交代表们，不得不越过窗户，匆匆地跑出会场。警察的镇压和对于恐怖的放纵，向参加会议的外国言论界代表明白说明南朝鲜远离民主和宪法。”
    一九五二年五月三十日路透社记者自釜山报道：南朝鲜副总统在辞职书上指出，“在官僚的独裁的腐败的李承晚政府名单中看到自己的名字是一件可耻的事情”。
    因为这样的事实太多，所以甚至连支持南朝鲜李承晚匪帮、显然采取不公正立场的联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会也不能否认这一事实。该委员会向联合国第七届大会提出的报告书里也承认了我所引证的外国观察家关于李承晚政治制度的反民主性质的报道。
    这一政治制度的树立者们知道，只有依靠外国军队的帮助才能维持其政治制度，所以南朝鲜的统治者们，拚命拉住美国刺刀，坚决反对外国军队从南朝鲜撤退。
    美国、南朝鲜及其他一部分代表，企图推卸美国和南朝鲜对朝鲜战争应负的责任和美国在联合国采取决议之前发动武装干涉的责任。这种企图是不正当的。
    对这一问题，在联合国大会的讨论和在报刊上所发表并在联合国大会被提出来的南朝鲜政府的文件证明，战争是从外部强加于朝鲜人民身上的，美国对此应负特别的责任。对北朝鲜的进攻，早在战争爆发以前，南朝鲜就在美国庇护之下进行准备了。我愿举出李承晚于一九四九年九月三十日给他的顾问美国教授奥利伏博士的信。李承晚在这封信里写道：“我认为现在正是采取进攻性步骤最适合的心理时机……我们要把金日成派赶到山里去，让他们在那儿慢慢饿死。”
    朝鲜战争开始以前，南朝鲜军队频繁地进攻三八线前沿我方警备队的事实也是举世周知的。这些进攻引起了大规模的军事冲突。仅在一九四九年一月至九月之间，南朝鲜军队进攻事件竟达四三一次之多。
    我愿提醒大家一件重要的事情，李承晚政府的秘密档案里的战略地图已被我们缴获，现在我政府手中，并已提到联合国大会。这张地图明白地证明对北朝鲜的进攻计划早在战争开始以前已经做好。这许多事实如实地证明，继续了三年多的朝鲜战争，其责任完全在于美国和南朝鲜李承晚政权当局。
    如众所周知，李承晚对北朝鲜的侵略的军事行动破产之后，李承晚匪帮还每天在叫嚣着用实力把自己的政治制度强加于北朝鲜，叫嚣要重新“北进”。但是毫无疑问地，如果李承晚匪帮敢于再度发动战争的话，朝鲜人民将给侵略者以更有决定性的打击。南朝鲜代表今天所作的疯狂的发言是不值得一驳的，他想借此隐蔽南朝鲜的黑暗和南朝鲜政治制度的反民主性质。他的发言对于和平解决朝鲜问题是毫无帮助的。
    澳大利亚代表要求对于有关组成全朝鲜委员会的几个问题加以澄清，特别是对于南北朝鲜代表名额的问题。委员会的组成考虑到要经过双方的协议，因此，全朝鲜委员会的名额问题不可能成为复杂的问题。有关组织程序上的问题以及其他问题，应经过双方间的协议而解决。澳大利亚代表表示很大的顾虑说该委员会在工作过程中将遭到巨大的困难。当然我们并不是没估计到我们的前途上有不小的困难。但是我们相信这种困难是可以克服的。毫无疑问，如果把调整朝鲜问题一事交给朝鲜人自己处理，消除外国对我国内政的干涉的话，朝鲜人必将克服一切困难，发挥充分的力量和决断，建立一个统一的、独立的民主国家。
