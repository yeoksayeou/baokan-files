    Colonialism Can End
    By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
    Today—the second day of discussions on restoring peace in Indochina. The speech by Pham Van Dong, chief representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, will be regarded by all righteous, peace-loving people as a very important historical document of the Geneva Conference. It is the language of facts, the language of history, the language of peace, and the language of the power of the people.
    In this speech, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with solemn historical facts, a just position, and a pragmatic attitude of consultation, expressed the determination and sincerity of the Indochinese people to strive for peace, national independence and freedom, and friendly cooperation with the French people. The correct, reasonable, and constructive plan he proposed became the "sensational news" at all press conferences today. Many journalists from the French bourgeois press frankly admitted that this plan was reasonable and logical. Only the representatives of the American delegation appeared at a loss in the face of this plan. For those French authorities who are intoxicated with colonialism under the American "policy of strength," it should be a very timely sobering agent.
    Indeed, saying they are intoxicated is quite polite. Look at how dishonest and lacking in sincerity the French delegation has been, from Bidault's arrival in Geneva to the first meeting on the Indochina issue on the 8th. As soon as Bidault arrived in Geneva, he issued an "appeal" for the evacuation of wounded and sick French soldiers from Dien Bien Phu. The Soviet and Chinese delegations both expressed sympathy for this appeal and suggested that he immediately contact the Democratic Republic of Vietnam directly, and discuss it in Geneva if necessary. However, at that time, Bidault still held a reserved attitude as to whether the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should be invited to participate in the Geneva Conference. Some reactionary American and French publications took the opportunity to spread rumors, slandering the Soviet and Chinese delegations as being "unsympathetic" to the wounded and sick, and "inhumane."
    A few days later, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam arrived in Geneva. In five or six days, the French delegation had no intention of making any contact with it. Instead, on May 3, they released information saying that they had actively consulted with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam through the Chinese delegation, and that the formal discussion of the Indochina issue had been scheduled for May 5, etc. Why create such an atmosphere? The reason was that the French Parliament was to reconvene the next day. All indications showed that the United States was stepping up behind-the-scenes planning on how to undermine the peace talks on the Indochina issue, which greatly shocked the French National Assembly. In order to deceive the French people and the National Assembly, "evacuating the wounded and sick" became a means for the United States and Bidault to employ. Only after the parliament reluctantly passed the "motion of confidence" did Bidault and others seem to breathe a sigh of relief. After the Vietnamese People's Army liberated Dien Bien Phu, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took the initiative to raise the issue of evacuating the wounded and sick, which showed that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam truly valued humanitarianism. Mr. Bidault was not concerned about any wounded or sick soldiers at all; his appeal was "aimed at something else."
    The liberation of Dien Bien Phu by the Vietnamese People's Army demonstrated the complete bankruptcy of the American-made "Navarre Plan" and the failure of the American interventionists. When the French people were preparing to further question who was responsible for this tragedy, and the French Parliament was scheduled to debate the Indochina issue again the next day, American officials and a small group of collaborators in Paris ran out of tricks and trotted out the myth of "Soviet rocket launchers" and "Chinese anti-aircraft guns" in an attempt to evade the people's blame. They even attempted to persecute "Le Monde" reporter Favreaux, who had recently reported honestly, based on his own experience, and refuted this kind of rumor-mongering by the US and France. Bidault and others not only refused to accept the lesson of Dien Bien Phu, but, as "Combat" said, still entered the Geneva conference as a "victor" and "conqueror."
    At the first meeting, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam suggested inviting representatives of the Cambodian and Laotian resistance governments to participate in the meeting, because in the long struggle against French colonialists and American interventionists, the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia fought side by side. Inviting representatives of the resistance governments of these two countries to participate in the meeting would obviously help to quickly and rationally resolve the Indochina issue.
    People remember the French colonialists' cruel exploitation of the Indochinese people, and they also remember their despicable surrender in the face of Japanese imperialist aggression. Even more, they remember how, under American instructions, they tore up the Franco-Vietnamese Preliminary Agreement of March 6 and the Provisional Agreement of September 14, 1946, and launched a full-scale war of aggression against the legitimate Democratic Republic of Vietnam, boastfully claiming to "achieve victory within three months." In the past seven or eight years, the French colonialists have lost hundreds of thousands of troops and have been compressed into a few coastal cities. The Vietnamese People's Army has liberated more than 90 percent of the country's territory. With the development of the anti-aggression movement of the Indochinese people, on April 19, 1950, the Cambodian People's Congress elected the Cambodian Central People's Liberation Committee (i.e., the Central Resistance Government), and on August 13, the Lao Free People's Congress opened, electing the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Free National United Front and forming the Lao Resistance Government. The resistance governments of these two countries led the people of the whole country to persist in the national liberation struggle, liberate vast territories and people, and win the praise of peace-loving people around the world.
    But French representative Bidault and American representative Smith slandered the Lao and Cambodian resistance governments as "ghosts," saying they were "illusory" things. Everyone knows that "ghosts" simply do not exist. Since the Lao and Cambodian resistance governments are "non-existent," why did the French government send troops thousands of miles away to fight with "non-existent" governments, and get beaten bloody and inextricably?
    Like Eisenhower and Dulles, Laniel and Bidault decorate themselves inside and outside the Geneva conference as protectors of "freedom," and call the Indochinese people, who are fighting for national rights and freedom, "rebels." Moreover, in order to use Bao Dai, this nightclub emperor, the spokesmen of the American and French delegations often do not forget to call him "Your Majesty." But, whether the colonialists like it or not, they finally have to sit down around a table with the representatives of the people who have already stood up...
    Honest observers here unanimously believe that the plan put forward by Bidault at the first meeting was very detrimental to the smooth progress of the meeting. Look, Bidault's plan is that all the resistance governments and armed forces of Laos and Cambodia must be dissolved and handed over to France; all guerrilla forces in Vietnam must be disarmed and the regular corps of the People's Army must be concentrated in certain areas, which, according to recent British, American and French newspapers, is to allow the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to give up most of the liberated territories and people... Compared with Laniel's plan of March 5, this can be called "outdoing the teacher," and even Bidault himself does not believe it has any value. "Le Monde" in Paris pointed out: Bidault's plan "in addition to being detrimental to the start of consultations, is also inconsistent with the current military situation." The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also believes it is "unrealistic" and wrote: "If one pretends that France alone or together with its allies can now negotiate on the Indochina issue with strength as a backing, it will not lead to any results."
    So how to explain the actions of the French colonialists? According to the "Chicago Sun-Times," Dulles once said in Washington: "The Indochina issue will be resolved in Washington, not in Geneva." It seems that this is the only explanation. In addition, Dulles delivered an important speech in Washington on the 7th, putting forward a three-point plan: (1) France gives the three federal member states of Indochina "complete independence" (that is, to enable the United States to further control them); (2) greater reliance on and organization of puppet troops; (3) give France and the federal member states "greater assistance." On the right bank of the Atlantic, French Prime Minister Laniel also delivered a speech in parliament, saying, "In the face of this defeat (referring to the liberation of Dien Bien Phu by the Vietnamese People's Army)...France, as a major country, will give its enemies a strong counterattack...Necessary measures have been taken to ensure that the strength of the expeditionary force will not be weakened." What smell do people smell from these two speeches? If we say that a small group of French authorities, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, have no determination to accept the lessons of history and get rid of the American trap of expanding the war, is it not very reasonable?
    Why does the American ruling group not want peace but wants to expand the war? A recent article in the New York "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" once again revealed their true intentions. An "economist" named Benson wrote in this newspaper: "Wall Street estimates that if we engage in a war against China and threaten to use atomic bombs, stock prices will rise."
    But these people should receive the lessons of history. The people of Asia have stood up, and the French people are firmly opposed to the war being waged in Indochina. Colonialism can end!

### 殖民主义可以休矣

    殖民主义可以休矣
    本报记者　吴文焘　李庄
    今天——讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的第二天。越南民主共和国首席代表范文同的发言，将为一切正义的爱好和平的人们看作是日内瓦会议的一个十分重要的历史性文件，它是事实的语言，历史的语言，和平的语言和人民力量的语言。
    在这个发言里，越南民主共和国的代表以严正的史实，正义的立场，实事求是的协商态度，表达了印度支那人民争取和平、民族独立与自由和与法国人民友好合作的决心与诚意；他所提出的正确合理的、充满建设性的方案，成了今天所有记者招待会上的“惊人消息”。不少的法国资产阶级报纸的记者坦率地承认，这个方案入情入理，只有像美国代表团的发言人才在这个方案面前表现了手足无措。对于那些在美国“实力政策”下沉醉于殖民主义的一部分法国当权者，它应当是一服十分及时的清醒剂。
    的确，说他们沉醉那是够客气了。你看从皮杜尔的来日内瓦，到八日关于印度支那问题的第一次会议，法国代表团是怎样地不老实和缺乏协商的诚意啊。皮杜尔一来到日内瓦，就发表了一个撤退奠边府法军伤病员的“呼吁”。苏联和中国代表团都对这个呼吁表示同情，并建议他立即和越南民主共和国直接接触，必要时在日内瓦商谈。但是，当时皮杜尔对于越南民主共和国是否应被邀请参加日内瓦会议还持保留的态度，美法的一些反动刊物就乘机大肆造谣，诬蔑苏联和中国代表团“不同情”伤病员，“不人道”。
    过了几天，越南民主共和国的代表来到日内瓦，在五六天的时间里，法国代表团根本没想和它作任何接触，却在五月三日放出空气说，它已积极经过中国代表团和越南民主共和国代表进行商谈了，印度支那问题的正式讨论已订在五月五日举行等等。为什么要制造这样的空气呢？原因是法国议会第二天就要复会了。种种迹象表明：美国正在幕后加紧策划如何破坏印度支那问题的和谈，使得法国国民议会大为震动。为了蒙蔽法国人民和国民议会，“撤退伤病员”就成了美国和皮杜尔们的一种手段。当议会勉强通过了“信任案”以后，皮杜尔等才似乎松了一口气。越南人民军解放奠边府后，越南民主共和国代表主动提出了撤退伤病员的问题，这说明了越南民主共和国政府是真正重视人道的，而皮杜尔先生原不是关心什么伤病员，他的呼吁本是“醉翁之意不在酒”的。
    越南人民军的解放奠边府，表现着美国出品的
  “纳瓦尔计划”的彻底破产，是美国干涉者的失败。当法国人民准备进一步质问谁负这个悲剧的责任，法国议会定于明日再度辩论印度支那问题时，美国官方和它在巴黎的一小群合作者们，又黔驴技穷，搬出了“苏联火箭炮”和“中国的高射炮”的神话，企图逃避人民的责难。对于像巴黎“世界报”记者法福莱尔不久以前以亲身经历来否认美法方面这种造谣的正直报道，则企图加以人身迫害。皮杜尔们不但不肯接受奠边府的教训，却像“战斗报”所说的仍然以一个“胜利者”“征服者”的姿态进入日内瓦的会场。
    在第一次会议上，越南民主共和国代表建议邀请高棉和寮国抗战政府的代表参加会议，因为在反对法国殖民者和美国干涉者的长期斗争中，越南、寮国、高棉三国人民并肩作战，邀请这两个国家的抗战政府代表参加会议，显然有助于迅速合理地解决印度支那问题。
    人们记得法国殖民者对于印度支那人民的残酷的压榨，也记得他们在日本帝国主义者进攻面前的卑鄙的投降，更记得他们如何在美国的指示下撕毁一九四六年三月六日和九月十四日的法越初步协定和临时协定，发动了侵略合法的越南民主共和国的全面战争，并侈言在“三个月内取得胜利”。七八年来，法国殖民者丧师数十万，被压缩到少数沿海沿线城市中；越南人民军则解放了百分之九十以上的国土。随着印度支那人民反侵略运动的发展，在一九五零年四月十九日，高棉人民代表大会选出高棉中央人民解放委员会（即中央抗战政府），八月十三日自由寮国人民代表大会开幕，选出寮国自由民族统一战线中央执行委员会，并组成寮国抗战政府。这两个国家的抗战政府领导全国人民坚持民族解放斗争，解放了广大的国土和人民，博得了世界爱好和平人民的称赞。
    但法国代表皮杜尔和美国代表史密斯，却诬蔑寮国和高棉抗战政府为“幽灵”，说它们是“虚无飘渺”的东西。谁都知道，“幽灵”是根本不存在的，既然寮国和高棉抗战政府是“不存在的”，法国政府为什么又派遣大兵远涉万里去和“不存在的”政府打仗，而且被对方打的头破血流不可开交呢？
    和艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯们一样，拉尼埃、皮杜尔们，在日内瓦会议内外把自己打扮成“自由”的保护者，而把争取民族权利和自由的印度支那人民称作“叛逆”。而且为了使用保大这位夜总会的皇帝，美国和法国代表团的发言人还经常不忘把他称作“陛下”呢。但是，不管殖民主义者喜欢不喜欢，他们终于不得不和已经站立起来了的人民的代表在
  一张桌子周围坐下来了……。
    这里的正直的观察家们一致认为，皮杜尔在第
  一次会议上所提出的方案，是十分不利于会议的顺利进行的。你看，皮杜尔的方案是所有寮国和高棉的抗战政府和武装部队都要解散，听任法国来接收；越南境内的游击部队全部缴械，把人民军正规兵团集结在一定的地区，而按照近来英美法报纸上所讲的就是让越南民主共和国放弃绝大部分的解放了的国土和人民……。这和拉尼埃三月五日的方案相比较，真可谓“青出于蓝”，连皮杜尔自己也不相信它有什么价值。巴黎“世界报”指出：皮杜尔的方案“除了对于协商的开端不利外，也是与目前的军事情况不相符的”。英国保守党的“每日电讯报”也认为它“不现实”，并写道：“如果假装做法国单独或和它的盟国一起，现在能够就印度支那问题进行以实力为后盾的谈判，这不会有任何结果。”
    那么怎样解释法国殖民主义者的所作所为呢？据“芝加哥太阳报”透露：杜勒斯在华盛顿曾经表示：“印度支那问题将在华盛顿解决，而不在日内瓦”。看来这似乎就是唯一的解释了。另外，杜勒斯七日在华盛顿发表了一个重要演说，提出三点计划：（一）法国给予印度支那三个联邦成员国家“以完全的独立”（也就是说使美国能够进一步控制他们）；（二）更加依靠和组织伪军；（三）给法国和联邦成员国以“更大的援助”。在大西洋右岸，法国总理拉尼埃也在议会发表了一个演说，他说，“在面对这次挫败（指奠边府被越南人民军解放）……的情形之下，法国作为一个大国将给予它的敌人以有力的反击。……已在采取必要的措施以保证远征军的力量将不会被削弱。”人们从这两个演说中嗅到什么气味呢？如果说，法国一小部分当权者不顾人民的死活，没有决心接受历史教训，摆脱美国扩大战争的圈套，不是很有道理么？
    美国统治集团为什么不要和平而想扩大战争呢？最近纽约“商业与金融纪事报”登载的一篇文章再一次透露了它们的真情实意，一个名叫本逊的
  “经济学家”，在这个报上写道：“华尔街估计，如果我们从事反对中国的战争，并且威胁使用原子弹的话，股票价格就会上涨”。
    但是这些人应该领受领受历史教训了。亚洲人民已经站立起来，法国人民是坚决反对在印度支那所进行的战争的。殖民主义可以休矣！
