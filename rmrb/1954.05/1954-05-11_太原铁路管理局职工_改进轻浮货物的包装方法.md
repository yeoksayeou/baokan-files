Taiyuan Railway Bureau Employees
Improve Packaging Methods for Light and Bulky Goods

    Employees of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau are constantly improving the packaging and loading methods for light and bulky goods, thereby increasing railway transport capacity.

    The light and bulky goods transported by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau mainly consist of industrial raw materials such as cotton, wool, and hemp. These goods have large volumes and light weights, occupying a relatively large area of the train cars. This year, the Bureau's transportation task for light and bulky goods increased by 247 percent compared to last year, but the number of vehicles has increased very little. To solve this difficulty, all units under the Bureau launched a technical innovation movement to improve packaging and loading methods, and have now achieved significant results. An important example is the cotton baling machine, which compresses the volume by nearly half and improves the packaging specifications, increasing the cotton loading capacity from 15 tons per train car to 28 tons.

    This April, Wu Runsheng, Zhang Ying, and Wu Zhenshuang from Taiyuan North Station, in collaboration with Liu Guangfu and Wu Derun from the cooperative, changed manual hemp bundling to semi-mechanical hemp bundling. Due to volume compression and improved loading methods, the load increased from 15 tons to 30 tons per train car. To date, new loading records have been set for 27 types of light and bulky goods at the Bureau, including pears, wool, cabbage, medicinal materials, and tobacco. As a result, the Bureau's transport capacity increased by nearly 8,000 train cars in the first quarter.

    太原铁路管理局职工
    改进轻浮货物的包装方法
    太原铁路管理局职工不断改进轻浮货物包装和装载方法，提高了铁路运输能力。
    太原铁路局承运的轻浮货物主要是棉、羊毛、麻等工业原料。这些货物体积大、分量轻，占用车皮面积较大。今年该局轻浮货物运输任务较去年增加百分之二百四十七，但车辆却增加很少。为解决这一困难，该局所属各单位展开了改进包装、装载方法的技术革新运动，现已获得显著成就。其中重要的如棉花打包机，压缩了体积近一半，并改进了包装规格，使棉花的装载量由每车皮十五吨提高到二十八吨。
    今年四月太原北站吴润生、张英、吴振双和合作社刘光甫、吴德润等共同协作下，把人工捆麻改为半机械捆麻，由于体积压缩和装载方法的改善，装载由过去每辆车皮十五吨提高到三十吨。到目前为止，该局已有梨、羊毛、白菜、药材、烟草等二十七种轻浮货物的装载的新纪录出现。因此，使该局第一季度增加了相当近八千辆车皮的运输能力。
