Preliminary Experiences in Conducting Production Collaboration in the Machinery Industry
Wu WanShan

The development of modern industry has led to increasingly detailed production division of labor and a high degree of production specialization within enterprises. Taking the switch factory of the Electrical Engineering Bureau as an example, the factory used to produce a relatively complex range of products, including switches, electric meters, transformers, electric motors, railway signaling equipment, and other major categories. Later, due to the needs of production development, railway signaling equipment was established as a specialized manufacturing factory, and transformers and electric motors were also produced by other factories and discontinued. The electric meter manufacturing section also developed into an independent electric meter factory. Consequently, this switch factory developed into a factory specializing in the production of switches, greatly improving the equipment utilization rate and labor productivity of the enterprise. However, along with the specialized production within the enterprise came extensive production collaboration between enterprises. This relationship is closely linked, mutually influencing, and mutually restraining. Taking the switch factory as an example again, in 1954, it needed to collaborate with other enterprises to produce 26 types of components, totaling over one million pieces. Therefore, the more highly specialized the enterprise, the more extensive collaboration it needs.

The development of mechanical industry production and the increasing complexity of products require more enterprises to collaborate and cooperate to manufacture complete sets of products. For example, the gantry planer could be manufactured by just one factory when it was belt-driven. When it later developed into an electric-driven type, it required collaboration between a machine tool factory and an electric motor factory. Today, when it has developed into the Soviet-style 724 type gantry planer, it requires collaboration from four or more machine factories. As for larger and newer complete sets of equipment, it requires even more enterprises to collaborate and cooperate to complete. The production collaboration formed due to the above reasons is long-term production collaboration. The collaboration relationship between these collaborating factories is relatively fixed and long-term. This type of production collaboration should be organized and led by the ministry or bureau.

The second type of collaboration is short-term production collaboration. There is often an imbalance between the production tasks and production capacity of each enterprise, with some links being weak and others having surplus capacity. Organizing the surplus production capacity of Factory A to supplement the insufficient capacity of Factory B can increase the equipment utilization rate in Factory A and enable Factory B to complete its production tasks smoothly. This type of production collaboration is often temporary, and the collaboration relationship between enterprises is not fixed. For example, the crankshaft forging capacity of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory was insufficient, becoming a weak link in the factory's production, affecting the progress of production. At the same time, the forging workshops of the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard and the Jiangnan Shipyard had surplus capacity. Later, the three factories collaborated and cooperated, enabling the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory to complete its production tasks and, at the same time, enabling the Jiangnan and Hudong Shipyards to fully utilize the capacity of their forging workshops. This type of production collaboration is of particular significance to the mechanical industry at the present stage. The old mechanical industry was mainly based on repair and fitting. In the process of transforming from repair and fitting to manufacturing, the production tasks and production varieties are constantly changing, and the imbalance of production capacity is particularly prominent, which particularly requires balancing through this collaborative approach.

The mechanical industry is particularly well-positioned to organize production collaboration. First, the production processes of mechanical factories, whether in the metalworking workshop, casting workshop, forging workshop, or riveting and welding workshop, are basically the same in terms of equipment and technology. Second, the products of mechanical factories are complex, with many parts and components and many processes, so the possibility of collaboration is greater. In short, in the mechanical industry, production collaboration is necessary and possible, and therefore should be given attention by all enterprises.

Production collaboration is a new task for us, and we lack experience. Although we did some work in 1953, it was still in the trial stage. In organizing production collaboration, we have the following preliminary experiences.

I. A correct understanding of production collaboration is the central link in promoting this work. Regarding the need and possibility of carrying out production collaboration in the mechanical industry, some enterprises have improved their understanding through the practice of the past year, but many comrades still have considerable deviations in their understanding, mainly manifested in two aspects: On the one hand, in accepting collaboration tasks, some enterprises are afraid of affecting their specialization, disrupting their plans, causing trouble, and being lazy and unproductive. They would rather let a large amount of production capacity be idle and wasted than accept collaboration tasks. Even if they accept it, they want drawings and materials, and do not actively try to solve difficult problems. For example, when the Northeast Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building organized the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory to collaborate with the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory in producing explosion-proof switch housings, the factory initially used the excuse of insufficient riveting and welding strength to refuse to accept the collaboration task. When the Northeast Office transferred riveting and welding workers from other factories to the factory, it refused to accept them on the grounds that there were no dormitories for the workers. On the other hand, those who need collaborative cooperation do not pay attention to the collaborative work, and do not regard it as one of the main projects in production organization. Some enterprises ask the higher authorities for investment to add equipment when they find weak links, instead of solving them through collaboration, attempting to not ask for help from others in everything. Still other enterprises propose the need to ask fraternal factories for collaboration on the one hand, and purchase from the market or abroad on the other hand, grabbing everywhere and stepping on several boats. As a result, there are cases where agreements are not signed after organizing collaboration, and requests for returns are made after signing agreements. The above-mentioned departmentalism of only caring about oneself and not caring about others, and the supply system of lacking careful calculation, not actively tapping potential, and not fully utilizing surplus production capacity must be criticized.

II. The relationship between the collaboration plan and the national plan must be clarified. The result of organizing production collaboration is specifically reflected in the collaboration plan. In order to promote collaborative work, the ministry and bureau should do a good job in collaboration planning. In terms of short-term production collaboration, after organizing collaboration, the collaboration projects should be included in the national plan of the enterprise accepting the collaboration tasks, so as not to be squeezed out by other tasks and unable to complete them well. For example, after the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory accepted the task of processing underground pipe fittings for drilling rigs, it was calling for increasing production and saving at that time. Because the output value of pipe fitting processing was small and not included in the national plan, it was not used as an item to assess whether the task was completed. As a result, it only paid attention to increasing the production of mine cars and did not strive to complete the collaboration tasks, affecting the complete supply of drilling rigs.

In terms of long-term production collaboration, a collaboration plan should be formulated before organizing collaboration in order to organize collaboration. Taking the matching of electric motors with machines as an example, in the past, because there was a lack of collaboration plans in this regard, there were machines without electric motors, or both were produced, but they did not match in quantity or time. This is particularly prominent in the trial production of new products and the production of complete sets of power generation equipment (diesel generators, gasoline generators). The reason for the long-term mismatch between machines and electricity lies in the lack of a collaboration plan.

III. In terms of the method of organizing production collaboration, it must be combined with production preparation work. The enterprise prepares various tasks before production based on the production plan approved by the state, calculates the balance between production capacity and tasks, and puts forward the required purchased parts and semi-finished products, as well as the weak links that need to be assisted by brother enterprises to overcome, which are the items requiring collaboration. Therefore, to correctly and timely propose collaboration projects, it must be combined with production preparation work. To be sure of accepting collaboration tasks, you must first understand the capacity balance of the enterprise, that is, it must also be combined with production preparation work. This is the case in enterprises, and it is also the case in departments responsible for organizing collaboration in ministries, bureaus, and offices. Before organizing collaboration, we must first check the production preparation work of each enterprise in order to have a clear idea and work actively.

IV. Long-term production collaboration should establish fixed relationships between enterprises. When the development direction of the enterprise has been determined and the products are relatively finalized, enterprises that can establish fixed collaborative relationships should establish relationships to eliminate the phenomenon of poor collaborative cooperation from the bottom up. The ministry and bureau must also select enterprises with the conditions to promote fixed connections in 1954 and focus on trial implementation to gain experience for future comprehensive promotion.

    在机械工业中开展生产协作的初步体会
    武万善
    近代工业的发展使生产分工日益细密，企业内部生产高度专业化。以电工局的开关厂为例，该厂过去产品相当复杂，有开关、电表、变压器、电动机、铁路讯号设备等几大类。以后由于生产发展的需要，铁路讯号设备成立了专门制造工厂，变压器、电动机也由别厂承制而停造，电表制造部分也发展成为独立的电表工厂，因而，这个开关厂就发展成为专业生产开关的工厂，使企业的设备运用率和劳动生产率都大为提高。但随着企业内部专业生产而来的，是企业与企业间广泛的生产协作，这种关系是密切关联，互相影响，互相约制的，仍以开关厂为例：一九五四年度须由其他企业协作生产的部件就有二十六种，一百余万件。所以愈是高度专业化的企业，就愈需要有广泛的协作。
      机械工业生产的发展，产品日渐复杂，需要有更多的企业互相协作配合，制造成套产品。例如龙门刨床，是皮带传动式的时候，只要一个厂就可以制造。当后来发展为电动式的时候，就要由机床厂和电机厂两个厂协作才能制造。当今天发展为苏式七二四型龙门刨床时，就要由四个以上的机器厂来协作方能制造。至于更大更新型的成套设备，就需要更多企业协作配合，方能完成。由于上述原因而形成的生产协作，为长期的生产协作，这种协作厂与厂之间的协作关系比较固定、长期。这类生产协作宜由部或局来组织和领导。
    协作的第二种类型为短期的生产协作，每个企业的生产任务和生产能力之间常不平衡，有些环节薄弱，另一些环节有余。组织甲厂的剩余生产能力以补乙厂的能力不足，在甲厂可以提高设备运用率，在乙厂可使生产任务顺利完成。这类生产协作常是临时性的，企业与企业之间的协作关系不固定。例如：上海柴油机厂的曲轴锻造能力不足，成为该厂生产中的薄弱环节，影响了生产的进行，但同时上海沪东造船厂及江南造船厂锻工车间能力又有剩余，以后三厂互相协作配合，使上海柴油机厂的生产任务得以完成，同时使江南及沪东造船厂充分发挥了锻工车间的能力。这种类型的生产协作，对现阶段的机械工业更有其重要意义。旧的机械工业是以修配为主的。在从修配为主转为以制造为主的过程中，生产任务生产品种不断变动，生产能力的不平衡性显得特别突出，也就特别需要通过这种协作的方式来取得平衡。
    在机械工业中特别有条件组织生产协作。首先，机械工厂的生产过程，无论在金工车间，铸工车间，锻工车间或铆焊车间，其设备以至技术，基本上是相同的。其次，机械工厂的产品复杂，零件部件多，工序亦多，因此协作的可能性就大。总之，在机械工业中，生产协作是需要的，可能的，因此应引起各企业单位的重视。
    生产协作工作，对我们来说是一件新工作，经验十分缺乏，一九五三年虽然做了一些工作，但还处在试行阶段。在组织生产协作工作中，我们初步的有下列几点体会。
    一、对生产协作的正确认识是推动这一工作的中心环节。对在机械工业中开展生产协作的需要和可能，有些企业通过一年来的工作实践，认识已有所提高，但也有不少同志在认识上还有相当偏差，主要表现在两方面：在接受协作任务的一方面，若干企业怕影响专业，怕打乱计划，怕麻烦，嫌劳而无功。宁愿让大量生产能力闲置浪费，不愿接受协作任务。即使接受了，也要图纸，要材料，不积极设法解决困难问题。例如：中央第一机械工业部东北办事处组织沈阳电工机械厂为沈阳低压开关厂协作生产防爆开关外壳时，该厂开始以铆焊力量不足为借口，不接受协作任务，东北办事处自他厂借调铆焊工人给该厂时，又借口无工人宿舍，拒不接受。在需要协作配合的一方面，则对协作工作不重视，不作为生产组织工作中主要项目之一。有些企业发现了薄弱环节就向上级要投资添设备，而不愿通过协作方式解决，企图一切不求别人。另有一些企业则一手提出需要请兄弟厂协作，一手向市场向国外采购，到处乱抓，脚踏几条船。因而发生组织协作以后不签协议，签了协议要求退货的情况。以上这种只顾自己，不顾别人的本位思想，及缺乏精打细算，不主动挖潜力，充分利用剩余生产能力的供给制思想是必须批判的。
    二、协作计划和国家计划的关系必须明确。组织生产协作的结果具体体现于协作计划。为了推进协作工作，部与局应做好协作计划。在短期生产协作方面，在组织协作以后，应将协作项目列入接受协作任务的企业的国家计划，以免受其他任务的排挤，不能很好完成。例如沈阳矿山机器厂接受钻探机地下管件的加工任务后，当时正号召增产节约，由于管件加工的产值小，且未列入国家计划，不作为考核完成任务与否的项目，结果只注意增产矿车，不努力完成协作任务，影响了钻探机的成套供应。
    在长期生产协作方面，则应在组织协作之前先订协作计划，以便组织协作。以电机配合机器为例：以往因为这方面缺乏协作计划，以致有了机器缺少电机，或两者都生产了，但在数量上、时间上不相配合。特别在新产品试制及成套发电设备生产上（柴油发电机、汽油发电机）最为突出，长期存在着机电不配合，其原因即在于缺少协作计划。
    三、在组织生产协作的方法上，必须和生产准备工作相结合。企业根据国家批准的生产计划作生产前各项准备工作，计算生产能力和任务的平衡情况，提出所需的外购部件及半成品，以及需要兄弟企业协助克服的薄弱环节，即为要求协作的项目。因此要正确及时地提出协作项目，就必须和生产准备工作相结合。要能确实有把握接受协作任务，也必须先了解本企业的能力平衡情况，即也须和生产准备工作相结合。在企业如此，在部、局及办事处负责组织协作的部门也是如此。在组织协作以前，必须先检查各企业的生产准备工作，才能心中有数，工作主动。
    四、长期的生产协作应建立企业与企业间的固定关系。在企业的发展方向已经确定，产品比较定型的时候，应将能建立固定协作关系的企业建立关系，以从下而上地消除协作配合不好的现象。部与局还须在一九五四年度先选择有条件推行固定联系的企业，重点试行，为今后全面推行吸取经验。
