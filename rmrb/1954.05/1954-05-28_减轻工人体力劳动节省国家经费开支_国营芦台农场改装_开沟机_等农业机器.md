Reducing Workers' Physical Labor and Saving National Expenditures
　　State-Run Lutai Farm Modifies "Ditching Machine" and Other Agricultural Machinery
　　Employees of the State-Run Lutai Farm have created a "Rice Paddy Levee Sowing Hand Clutch" for rice sowing operations and have experimentally modified a "ditching machine," greatly reducing workers' physical labor, shortening working hours, and increasing national wealth.
　　The rice planting area of ​​Lutai Farm accounts for approximately 40% of the total cultivated land area, requiring more than 300,000 jin of rice seeds. Every year after sowing, due to the wide and uneven ground and inconsistent water levels, many ditches and levees must be dug in the ground. The area of ​​the ditches and levees is equivalent to 10% of the rice paddy area. In this way, digging ditches and levees requires a large amount of labor; and a lot of rice seeds are lost in the sections where the ditches and levees are dug. The farm's leading cadres called on comrades in the mechanized farming team to find ways to solve this problem. Zhang Ming, the deputy captain of the mechanized farming team, and Zhang Zongyi, the captain of the repair team, worked with comrades such as Zhang Zhongkui, Ma Zhenkui, Miao Fenggang, and Song Ying to conduct joint research. With the support and assistance of the State Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, after many experiments and revisions, they finally created the "Rice Paddy Levee Sowing Hand Clutch" and the "ditching machine." The "Rice Paddy Levee Sowing Hand Clutch" modifies the clutch on the seed-feeding wheel of the original sowing machine, allowing the farm tool operator in charge of the sowing machine to control it. This allows leaving spaces when sowing where ditches and levees will be dug. This alone can save the farm more than 24,000 jin of rice seeds each year.
　　According to the farm's calculations, using the "ditching machine," one tractor can pull it and dig more than 20 ditches, each 75 meters long and 45 centimeters deep, per hour. This is equivalent to the labor of more than 100 agricultural workers. Based on the more than 3,000 ditches the farm will dig this year, it will save more than 10 million yuan compared to using manual labor. It also saves a lot of work hours, allowing for digging and immediate irrigation, enabling the rice seedlings to emerge and mature earlier.

    减轻工人体力劳动节省国家经费开支
    国营芦台农场改装“开沟机”等农业机器
    国营芦台农场职工在水稻播种作业上，创造了“水稻隔埝播种手离合器”并试验改装了“开沟机”，大大减轻工人体力劳动，缩短了工时，并为国家增加了许多财富。
    芦台农场的水稻播种面积约占全部耕地面积的百分之四十，需要稻种三十万斤以上。每年播种后，因地面宽广不平，上水不一致，必须在地上开挖许多沟埝，沟埝的面积相当于水稻田面积的百分之十。这样，挖沟埝时既要投入大批的劳动力；在挖沟埝的地段里又损失了很多稻种。该场领导干部号召机耕队同志想办法解决这一问题。机耕队副队长张铭、修理队队长张宗义便和张忠奎、马振奎、苗凤刚、宋英等同志共同研究，并在中央农业部国营农场管理总局的支持与帮助下，经过多次试验修改，终于创造了“水稻隔埝播种手离合器”和
  “开沟机”。“水稻隔埝播种手离合器”是把原播种机输种轮上的离合器加以改装，由看管播种机的农具手来控制，这样，播种时即可将准备挖沟埝的地方留下，仅该场每年即可节省两万四千多斤稻种。
  “开沟机”的使用，据该场计算，用一部拖拉机牵引，每小时能挖七十五公尺长、四十五公分深的沟二十余条相当于一百多个农工的劳动。以该场今年所挖的三千多条沟计算，比用人工要节约一千多万元。并节省了大量工时，可以随播随挖、提前灌水，使稻谷早日出苗提早成熟。
