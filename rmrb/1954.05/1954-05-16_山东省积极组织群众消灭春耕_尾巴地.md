    Shandong Province Actively Organizes the Masses to Eliminate "Tail-End Land" in Spring Plowing
    In this year's spring plowing and sowing work in Shandong Province, the local CPC committees and people's governments conducted inspections and discovered that many areas still had "tail-end land" remaining from spring plowing. The Linyi Special District's inspection as of April 19th revealed that the entire special district had approximately 400,000 mu of "tail-end land" from spring plowing, accounting for 4.5% of the total spring plowing area of the special district. After inspection, other special districts also had "tail-end land" remaining to varying degrees. This "tail-end land" from spring plowing mostly belonged to widowed, orphaned, and childless households without labor who had not participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, or to households affected by illness and disaster. Some belonged to fishermen in coastal areas, who were busy fishing at sea during the peak fishing season, and therefore were unable to complete spring plowing and sowing. For example, in the 12th District of Yexian County in the Laiyang Special District, after many fishermen went to sea to fish, their families had 300 mu of "tail-end land" left uncultivated. As another example, in the 14th District of Pingdu County, 616 households lacked labor, and some households suffered from illness and disaster, so the spring plowing area only accounted for 40% of the total spring plowing area.
    The CPC committees and people's governments at all levels in Shandong Province attached great importance to this situation. In order to thoroughly complete this year's spring plowing and sowing tasks and strive for an all-around bumper harvest, various localities sent people to inspect and organized the masses to vigorously eliminate the "tail-end land" from spring plowing. By April 30th, the Linyi Special District had eliminated 300,000 mu of "tail-end land" from spring plowing. The Jining Special Commissioner's Office allocated 5.7 billion yuan in relief funds to help farmers in disaster areas complete their spring plowing and sowing tasks. Most areas have taken the following measures to eliminate "tail-end land" from spring plowing: 1. Mobilize mutual aid and cooperation organizations with the conditions and strength to absorb households without labor into groups and cooperatives on a voluntary basis; 2. Help households in difficulty to organize themselves to help each other solve difficulties; 3. Mutual aid groups and agricultural producers' cooperatives provide paid cultivation and sowing on behalf of others; 4. Encourage relatives to help relatives and neighbors to help neighbors.

    山东省积极组织群众消灭春耕“尾巴地”
    山东省在今年春耕春播工作中，各地中共党委和人民政府进行了检查，发现不少地区留有春耕“尾巴地”。临沂专区截至四月十九日的检查，全专区有春耕“尾巴地”四十万亩左右，占全专区总春耕地面积的百分之四点五。其他各专区经过检查，都或多或少留有春耕“尾巴地”。这些春耕“尾巴地”多属于没有参加互助合作组织的鳏、寡、孤、独无劳动力户，或病灾户，有的则属于沿海地区渔民，因正值大海市期间，渔民忙于下海捕鱼，因而未能完成春耕春种。如莱阳专区掖县十二区，许多渔民下海捕鱼后，家中留有三百亩“尾巴地”没人耕种。又如平度县十四区，全区有六百一十六户缺乏劳动力，还有一些户遭受病灾，因而春耕地仅占总春耕地面积的百分之四十。
    中共山东省各级党委和人民政府对这种情况十分重视。为彻底完成今年春耕播种任务，争取全面丰收，各地都派人检查，并组织群众大力消灭春耕
  “尾巴地”。到四月三十日，临沂专区已消灭春耕“尾巴地”三十万亩。济宁专署为帮助灾区农民完成春耕播种任务，曾拨发救济款五十七亿元。大部地区对消灭春耕“尾巴地”采取了以下办法：一、动员有条件有力量的互助合作组织吸收无劳力户在自愿的基础上入组、入社；二、帮助困难户组织起来相互帮助解决困难；三、由互助组、农业生产合作社有代价的代耕代种；四、发动亲帮亲、邻帮邻。
