I Want to Strive to Be Someone Who Always Runs Ahead of Time

　　Li Bingzhong, Model Worker of Chongqing Air Compressor Factory

　　In the spring of 1953, I had been working on the small planer for almost a year. I had grasped some understanding of the performance and production laws of the small planer. The characteristic of the small planer is: generally, the processed objects are small and the time is short, and there is a lot of time spent on loading and unloading objects and changing tools. In April, the factory revised the working hour quota, and my own plan was also set relatively high. However, there were a lot of rabbet jobs, and for every six or seven minutes of planing a piece, I had to change three or four tools and make corrections, which made me feel flustered. I was working for about four hours a day for eight hours, and I was worried that there would be problems completing the plan. One day, I walked past the lathe and saw the square tool post on the lathe (a flat iron disc with four tools installed), and I thought that the square tool post could clamp four tools at the same time, and changing tools was as simple as pulling it. So I thought: How wonderful it would be if I had a square tool holder on my small planer! But how to erect the square tool post and install it on my planer? I also felt that the knowledge of drawing was profound, and I didn't have the courage to experiment. At this time, the vigorous rationalization proposal campaign carried out in the factory encouraged me. At the same time, after participating in the factory's study of Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), I clearly recognized the meaning of "the state plan is the law." Thinking of our team's production plan, it would be impossible to complete it without improving the tools. I mustered up the courage to start drawing, and after nearly half a month, I drew a sketch. With the help and modification of technician Li Junqing, I drew a formal drawing and sent it to the Rationalization Proposal Committee.

　　Soon, my suggestion was adopted, and the tool workshop installed a tool rack. But during the test, the tool was skewed as soon as the machine moved, and the tool would not cut the workpiece, no matter what, and could not be planed at all. Some comrades said, "I said it wouldn't work! See how it is." I felt anxious and ashamed, and I was a little discouraged, but I thought: "I'm improving the tools to increase wealth for the country, there's nothing to be ashamed of, I should persevere and experiment again." At that time, I took off the tool rack and carefully checked it, and found that the holes for installing the tools were too shallow and the tools were too long. Later, I carefully corrected these shortcomings. The next day, when I tried the car again, the tool was really obedient. Each time I changed the tool, I only needed to turn the tool rack a quarter of a turn. The time to change a tool was reduced from the original thirty or forty seconds to about four seconds, significantly shortening the auxiliary time.

　　The small planer processes small objects in a short time. Too much time is wasted on loading and unloading workpieces and changing tools. Every time I loaded and unloaded workpieces, I paid attention to observation and wanted to make a "double mold" fixture to cross-load workpieces and continuously process them, so that the machine would not stop when loading and unloading workpieces. I drew a sketch and sent it to the Rationalization Proposal Committee. However, because I marked the dimensions incorrectly on the drawing, the fixture that was made was not suitable. But the production difficulties at that time were still not resolved, and the task of the carding machine could not be completed. So I went to ask the master worker for advice and discussed it with the comrades. After everyone's research, it was decided to use two vise grips instead and add two angle irons to the side of the planing table to successfully complete the experiment. In this way, the machine time was increased from the original 50% to 90%, greatly shortening the auxiliary time, quickly breaking through the new quota, and over-fulfilling the production task.

　　In order to fully utilize machine efficiency and improve productivity, I also learned from Li Congyan, a fast car hero in our factory, the method of operating with both hands: using the left hand to raise and lower, the right hand to turn on and off the car; one hand to take the raw material, one hand to put the finished product; both hands to hold the wrench to tighten and loosen the screws. When I first learned to operate with both hands, I was very unaccustomed to it. It was as difficult as using my right hand to hold chopsticks and suddenly switching to my left hand. But I was determined to train and resolutely fought against the habitual operating method. Soon, I gradually became proficient and developed a habit. Now, operating with both hands feels very flexible and light, and if I were to do it with one hand again, I would find it very inconvenient.

　　Wang Chonglun's accomplishment of four years' work in one year and the deeds of Wu Yunqiao, the author of the book "Dedication of Everything to the Party," who excellently worked for the Party, moved me very much and increased my courage to overcome difficulties. In particular, the road of innovation and creation they have taken has educated me and made me understand the greatness of collective strength. Any improvement and creation can only achieve greater success by closely relying on the masses and humbly accepting the opinions of the masses. Last December, in improving production work, I paid more attention to the connection with comrades and received a lot of help from everyone, and there were some improvements in production. For example, with the help of Master Zhou Xinan, according to the advanced experience of multi-tool multi-blade cutting in the Soviet Union, the work of planing the motor frame was changed to using double knives, and the efficiency was doubled. Later, with the support of the foreman, a large motor was called in to drive it, so that the two knives became one knife, and the efficiency was doubled again. In improving the planing of 45-degree inclined surfaces to flat surfaces, I also got the help of construction worker Bao Jizhen, who helped me find an old oil tank mold with a 45-degree inclined surface in the scrap iron pile, and only then was the transformation successful. The time to plane this kind of work was reduced from 25 minutes per piece to 8 minutes per piece. In particular, accepting the suggestion of planer Zheng Tingjun to plane copper cloth silk work by "clamping two at a time" doubled the production efficiency. With the help of collective strength, I was able to complete 27 days of production tasks in five days in December last year; complete 48 workdays in fifteen workdays in January this year; complete 52 workdays in seventeen workdays in February; and complete 52 and a half workdays in fifteen workdays in March. According to the situation in the past three months, production efficiency has increased threefold.

　　The reason why I can do this little work for the motherland is mainly due to the Party's continuous cultivation and education. The organization cares about my every tool improvement, not only giving support frequently and giving me a tool rack according to my height, but also sending a working group to summarize my work and develop the advantages in my technical operation. Through this summary, I learned about the shortcomings of my work and had a direction for improvement. At the same time, I also understood the advantages of others in operation, so that I can often absorb the advantages of others and overcome my own shortcomings. I am determined to follow the direction indicated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, along the road of technical innovation, complete the state plan ahead of schedule, strive to be a true socialist builder, and be someone who always runs ahead of time!

    我要争取做一个永远跑在时间前面的人
    重庆市空气压缩机厂劳动模范　李秉中
    一九五三年春天，我在小刨床上工作已快一年了。对于小刨床的性能和生产规律我已摸着了一些。小刨床的特点是：一般加工的物件小、时间短、上下物件、调换刀子的时间很多。四月间，厂里修改了工时定额，自己的计划也订得比较高，可是，止口活又特别多，每刨一件活的六、七分钟里，就要换三、四把刀子，还要校正，搞得我手忙脚乱，一天八小时工作，实际只刨四小时左右，眼看完成计划有问题，心里很苦闷。有一天，我从车床旁边走过，看到车床上的四方刀台（平放并装着四把刀子的铁盘）时，觉得四方刀台能同时夹四把刀子，换刀子只消把它拔一下就行了，于是我就想：要是在我的小刨床上设一个四方刀架那多妙呀！但如何把四方刀台竖起来，装在我的刨床上呢？又感到绘图学问深奥，没有勇气试验。这时，厂里开展的轰轰烈烈的合理化建议运动鼓舞了我，同时，通过参加厂里学习马林科夫同志在联共（布）党第十九次代表大会上的报告后，使我明确认识了“国家计划就是法律”的意义。想到我们小组的生产计划，如果不改进工具那是无法完成的。我就鼓着勇气着手绘图，一直搞了将近半个月，才画成了一张草图，经过技术员黎俊卿同志的帮助和修改，绘成正图，送给合理化建议委员会。
    不久，我的建议被采纳了，并由工具车间装成了刀排。但在试验时，机器一动刀子就歪了，刀子一搭上加工物件，死也不肯吃刀，根本不能刨。有的同志就说：“我说不行吧！看怎么样。”我听了心里又急又羞，真有点泄气，但我又想：“我改进工具是为了给国家多增加财富，没有什么可丢人的，应该坚持下去再试验。”当时我取下刀排又细心作了检查，发现装刀子的眼子太浅了，刀子也太长。后来我用心改正了这些缺点，第二天再试车时，刀子真听话，每换一次刀子只需把刀排扳转四分之一就行了，换一把刀子的时间由原来的三、四十秒钟减少到四秒钟左右，显著地缩短了辅助时间。
    小刨床加工的活小，时间短，上下活、调换刀子浪费的时间太多，我每次上下活都注意观察，想做一个“双模子”的夹具来交叉上活，连续加工，可以上下生活不停车。我画了一个草图送给合理化建议委员会。但由于自己在图样上尺寸标得不对头，做出来的夹具不合用。可是当时生产上的困难仍然没有解决，梳棉机的任务还是不能完成。于是我就去请教老师傅，并且和同志们一道商量，经大家研究的结果，决定用两把老虎钳代替，并在刨台侧面加两块角铁，才试验成功了。这样，机动时间由原来的百分之五十提高到百分之九十，大大缩短了辅助时间，很快突破了新定额，超额完成了生产任务。
    为了充分发挥机器效能，提高生产率，我还向本厂快车英雄李从燕师傅学会了运用左手升降、右手开、关车；一只手取毛胚，一只手放成品；双手同时拿扳手上下螺丝等的双手操作方法。开始学双手操作时也很不习惯，就好像吃饭用惯右手拿筷，突然换成左手一样困难，但我下决心进行训练，坚决和习惯的操作方法作斗争，不久终于逐渐的熟练了，并已养成习惯。现在双手操作倒觉得很灵活轻巧，要让我再一只手搞，倒反觉非常不方便了。
    王崇伦一年完成四年工作量和“把一切献给党”这本书的作者——吴运铎同志出色地为党工作的事迹，使我十分感动，增加了我克服困难的勇气。特别是他们所走过的革新创造的道路，更教育了我，使我明白了集体力量的伟大，任何改进和创造，只有紧紧依靠群众，虚心接受群众的意见，才能得到更大的成就。去年十二月，在改进生产工作中，我更加注意和同志们的联系，得到大家不少帮助，生产上又有了一些改进。如我在周西南师傅的帮助下，根据苏联多刀多刃切削的先进经验，把刨马达架的活改用了双刀，效率提高了一倍，以后又在工段长的支持下，调用了大马达来拖动，使两刀变成一刀走，效率又提高了一倍。在改进刨四十五度斜面活为平面活时，也得到施工员鲍积珍同志帮我在废铁堆里找到了一个四十五度斜面的旧油糟模子，才改造成功了，刨这种活的时间由二十五分钟刨一个降低到八分钟刨一个。特别是接受了刨工郑廷君对刨铜布丝活提出“一次夹两个”的建议，使生产效率提高了一倍。在集体力量的帮助下，使我在去年十二月份里能以五天时间完成了二十七天的生产任务；今年一月以十五个工作日完成了四十八个工作日的任务；二月份以十七个工作日完成了五十二个工作日的任务；三月份又以十五个工作日完成了五十二个半工作日的任务。根据三个月的情况来看，生产效率已提高了三倍。
    我能为祖国做这点点工作，主要是由于党的不断培养和教育，组织上对我每次改进工具都很关心，不仅经常地给以支持，按照我的身高给我工具架，并且派工作组将我的工作作了总结，把我技术操作中的优点加以发挥；通过这次总结，使我知道了自己工作的缺点，有了改进的方向，同时，也明白了别人在操作上的优点，使我能经常吸收别人的优点，克服自己的缺点。我决心遵循着共产党和毛主席所指示的方向，沿着技术革新的道路，提前完成国家计划，争取做一个真正的社会主义建设者，做一个永远跑在时间前面的人！
