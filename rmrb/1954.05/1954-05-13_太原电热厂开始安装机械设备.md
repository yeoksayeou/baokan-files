    Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant Begins Installing Mechanical Equipment
    After six months of intense construction, the framework project of the newly built Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant's main factory building has been completed ahead of schedule. Currently, the large-scale mechanical equipment installation project has been fully launched.
    As early as May, all construction sites had made plans for progress, materials, tools, labor allocation, and technical guidance. Many metal installation workers studied the Soviet Union's advanced installation experience and repeatedly discussed quality standards and operating procedures.
    Currently, installation work has begun at the main factory building, oxygen station, repair shop and other construction sites. In order to accelerate the progress of the installation project, the plant is learning from the Soviet Union's advanced installation experience, installing continuously in three shifts, day and night, and fully implementing mechanical installation.
    At present, more than 1,700 metal installation workers, under the close guidance of Soviet experts, are carrying out labor competitions, striving to generate partial electricity around the time of the October Revolution anniversary this year.

    太原电热厂开始安装机械设备
    新建太原电热厂经过六个月的紧张施工，主厂房的框架工程已提前全部完工，目前大规模的机械设备安装工程已全面展开。
    各工地早在五月以前作好了进度、材料、工具、劳力配备、技术指导等措施计划。许多金属安装工人都学习了苏联的先进安装经验，反复讨论了质量标准和操作规程。
    目前主厂房、氧气站、修配厂等工地均已开始了安装工作。为了加速安装工程进度，该厂学习苏联先进的安装经验，三班连续安装，昼夜不停，并完全实行机械安装。
    现在，一千七百余名金属安装工人，正在苏联专家亲切的指导下，开展劳动竞赛，争取在今年十月革命节前后部分发电。
