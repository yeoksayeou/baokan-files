Guangdong Province Farmers Vigorously Develop Sideline Production
Spring Silkworm White Cocoons and Sand Green Cocoons Generally Achieve a Bumper Harvest

    After the spring plowing, farmers in Guangdong Province, without affecting the current agricultural production, vigorously develop sideline production according to the characteristics of different regions. In the plains, they develop pig farming, chicken raising, duck raising, oil pressing, tofu making, dried bean curd making, and bamboo weaving; in the mountainous areas, they collect rosin, burn lime, and burn charcoal; in the coastal areas, they fish and catch shrimp to increase farmers' income, solve the problem of surplus labor, and provide a large amount of non-staple food for urban people. Some areas facing seasonal spring famine and areas that suffered poor harvests due to disasters last year can also solve some of the production and living difficulties of farmers by organizing sideline production.

    In the past, the sideline income of Guangdong farmers generally accounted for more than 20% to 30% of their total income. This year, thanks to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the rational use of labor, and government loans, more surplus labor has been invested in sideline production. In particular, agricultural production cooperatives, with unified management and collective labor, can carry out sideline production on a larger scale and in a planned manner. After the spring plowing, the Shangzha Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongshan County rationally divided the 31 laborers in the cooperative according to the needs of agricultural affairs. In addition to 9 people responsible for inter-tillage and weeding and 3 people responsible for cattle herding, all other laborers were invested in sideline production such as pig raising and wasteland reclamation to grow sweet potatoes. The Nanqiao, Bafang, Shifang, and Linghou Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Taishan County carry out sideline production such as pig raising, fish farming, and dried bean curd making. It is estimated that the annual sideline income will be at least 10 million yuan. The Taiqian Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingyuan County develops pig and sheep raising as a sideline, and it is estimated that it can accumulate 36,000 jin of pig and sheep manure annually, which is enough for 40 mu of farmland. Fifty of the 63 agricultural production cooperatives established in eastern Guangdong this spring have carried out sideline production according to local characteristics.

    In order to solve the problem of pig feed, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups generally combine pig raising with sideline production such as tofu making, dried bean curd making, and sweet potato flour grinding, so as to use bean dregs and sweet potato dregs as the main feed for pigs.

    Guangdong Province has generally achieved a bumper harvest of spring silkworm white cocoons and sand green cocoons this year. The state's implementation of cocoon pre-purchase and technical assistance has greatly increased the confidence of silkworm farmers in silkworm breeding. The more than 23,000 spring silkworm seeds promoted this spring generally yielded about 30 jin of cocoons per seed card, exceeding the production plan by 10% to 30%. In particular, silkworm farmers who have been organized have received more cocoons than ordinary individual silkworm farmers. For example, in Yangjiao Village, Shunde County, all 22 silkworm farming households organized a young silkworm co-breeding group, selecting experienced old silkworm farmers to specialize in the feeding and management of young silkworms. With the help of the silkworm technology guidance station, they purchased instruments and equipment such as thermometers and hygrometers, so that young silkworms could develop and grow under relatively normal temperature and humidity. This year, the growth rate reached more than 95%.

    The spring silkworm white cocoon production has now ended. According to the cocoon pre-purchase contract signed with the state, silkworm farmers have sold white cocoons to the state one after another. At present, Guangdong Provincial Silk Company has purchased about 5,000 dan of white cocoons, which can supply the local state-owned Shunde Silk Factory with more than seven months of raw material needs. The second crop of sand green cocoons and yellow cocoons is now also on the market in large quantities. It is estimated that the 10,000 spring sand green cocoon seeds promoted this spring can produce 2,000 dan of sand green cocoons, an average increase of about 30% compared with last year. At present, Guangdong Provincial Silk Company can purchase more than 100 dan of sand green cocoons every day. (Wu Erxiang)

    广东省农民大力发展副业生产
    春蚕白茧和沙青茧普遍丰收
    广东省农民在春耕结束后，在不影响当前农事生产的情况下，根据不同地区的特点，大力开展副业生产。在平原地区发展养猪、养鸡、养鸭、榨油、磨豆腐、煮腐竹、编竹器；在山区钩松香、烧石灰、烧木炭；在沿海地区则打鱼、捉虾等，以增加农民收入，解决部分剩余劳动力出路问题，并为城市人民提供大量副食品。有些面临着季节性春荒的地区和去年因灾歉收的地区，通过组织副业生产，也可解决部分农民生产、生活上的困难。
    广东农民副业收入，过去一般都占总收入百分之二、三十以上。今年由于互助合作运动的开展，合理使用劳动力和政府贷款帮助的结果，就有更多的剩余劳动力投入副业生产，特别是农业生产合作社，统一经营、集体劳动，副业生产就可以规模较大并有计划地进行。中山县上栅乡第一农业生产合作社在春耕结束后，根据农事的需要，把社内三十一个劳动力进行合理的分工，除九个人负责中耕除草和三个人专责看牛外，其他劳动力全部投入养猪、开荒种番薯等副业生产。台山县南乔、八坊、十坊、岭后等四个农业生产合作社，进行养猪、养鱼、煮腐竹等副业生产，估计全年副业收入至少也有一千万元以上。清远县台前乡第一农业生产合作社发展养猪、养羊副业，估计全年可积猪粪、羊粪三万六千斤，足供四十亩田肥料的需要。粤东区今春建立的六十三个农业生产合作社，已有五十个社根据当地的特点进行副业生产。
    为了解决喂猪饲料的问题，农业生产合作社和互助组，在养猪中一般都与磨豆腐、煮腐竹、磨薯粉等副业生产结合起来，以便将豆渣、薯渣用作猪的主要饲料。

    广东省今年春蚕白茧和沙青茧普遍丰收。由于国家实行了蚕茧预购工作和技术帮助，大大提高了蚕农养蚕信心。今春推广的二万三千多张白茧蚕种，每单张一般收茧都达到三十斤左右，超过生产计划百分之十到三十。特别是已组织起来的蚕农，比一般单干蚕农收茧更多。如顺德县杨?村全村二十二户蚕农组织一个稚蚕共育小组，挑选技术熟练的老蚕农专做稚蚕饲养料理工作，并在蚕桑技术指导站的帮助下，购置了温度计、干湿计等仪器设备，使稚蚕能够在比较正常的温湿度下发育成长。今年成长率达百分之九十五以上。
    现在春蚕白茧生产已结束。蚕农根据与国家订立的蚕茧预购合同，纷纷把白茧卖给国家。目前广东省丝绸公司已收购到白茧五千担左右，可供地方国营顺德缫丝厂七个多月生产原料的需要。第二造沙青茧和黄茧现在也已大量上市。今春推广的一万张沙青茧蚕种，估计可产二千担沙青茧，平均比去年增产百分之三十左右。目前广东省丝绸公司每天都可以收购到一百多担沙青茧。　（吴尔祥）
