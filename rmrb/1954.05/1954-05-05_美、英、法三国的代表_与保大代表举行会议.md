    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 4th: TASS reports: The head of the American delegation, Smith, Britain's Eden, and France's Bidault met here on the 3rd with Bảo Đại's representative, Nguyễn Quốc Định, the foreign minister of Bảo Đại, who had arrived in Geneva. After the meeting, Nguyễn Quốc Định issued a statement saying that the representatives of the Bảo Đại government "agreed" to participate in the Geneva Conference at the same time as the representatives of Democratic Vietnam, but he opposed in advance the passage of any resolution on the Indochina issue that would undermine Vietnam's "independence, autonomy, and territorial integrity."
    According to the communique issued on the May 3rd meeting, the meeting was held at the headquarters of the French delegation and was chaired by Bidault. The communique specifically pointed out that an agreement was reached at the meeting: Democratic Vietnam's participation in the Geneva Conference does not imply "legal recognition" of it. In addition, it was decided that representatives of the US, UK, France, and the Bảo Đại government delegations should continue to consult with each other during the future proceedings of the Geneva Conference.

    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社日内瓦讯：美国代表团团长史密斯、英国的艾登和法国的皮杜尔与到达日内瓦的保大代表、保大的外交部长阮国定于三日在此间举行会议。会后阮国定发表了声明，声明中说，保大政府的代表“同意”与民主越南代表同时参加日内瓦会议，但是他事先就反对在印度支那问题上通过任何足以破坏越南的“独立、自主和领土完整”的决议。
    据五月三日会议发表的公报说，会议在法国代表团总部举行，由皮杜尔担任主席。公报中特别指出，会上达成了一项协议：民主越南参加日内瓦会议不意味着对它的“法律上的承认”。此外还决定：美国、英国、法国和保大政府代表团的代表在今后日内瓦会议进行过程中仍应互相磋商。
