Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's organ, "People's Daily," published an editorial on the 13th, commenting on the great significance of the victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign.

The editorial said: In three offensives, the Vietnamese People's Army completely annihilated more than 16,000 enemy troops in the strongly fortified Dien Bien Phu group stronghold. Thus, the northwest of Vietnam has been completely liberated, and the historically significant Dien Bien Phu campaign has achieved a glorious victory. This is the greatest military victory achieved by the Vietnamese army and people since the beginning of the war of self-defense.

The editorial said: The enemy air-dropped troops into Dien Bien Phu, intending to occupy the northwest of Vietnam and rebuild the puppet "Autonomous Thai Federation" in order to sow discord among the various ethnic groups in Vietnam; at the same time, they tried desperately to hold onto Upper Laos and reoccupy the vast area where China, Vietnam, and Laos meet. This is part of the "Navarre Plan" planned by the American interventionists and French colonial war-mongers.

The editorial talked about the reasons for the victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign: We achieved a major victory in Dien Bien Phu because: we had the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, as well as the decisive and correct command of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army; after the political and military training movement, the political, military, and technical levels of cadres and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army have been improved, and in the offensive, they were closely united, fought bravely, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and at the same time, the People's Army on other battlefields across the country closely coordinated with the Dien Bien Phu campaign; our people (most of whom are farmers) actively participated in the labor teams to support the front; the solidarity of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and their determination to fight for freedom and independence, and the warm support of the French people and peace-loving people all over the world for our war of self-defense.

The editorial pointed out: Our victory in Dien Bien Phu is also a victory of justice, freedom, and peace. This marks the continuous progress made by our army and people in the long and arduous war of resistance against imperialist aggressors. This is a serious blow to the American interventionists and French colonial war-mongers. Our victory in Dien Bien Phu has brought a heavy defeat to the imperialists' plot to cut off the connection between the people in the plains and mountainous areas of Vietnam. This shows that although the imperialists possess modern weapons, they are bound to fail because they do not have the support of the people. This also shows that there is no force in the world (no matter how powerful it is) that can conquer a nation that is determined to fight for national independence and the right to live a free and peaceful life.

The editorial said: The conspiracy of the American interventionists and French colonial war-mongers is extremely cunning, and they are delaying and expanding the Indochina war. American imperialists are taking advantage of the French Expeditionary Force's disastrous defeat to further intervene in this "dirty war" and further attack the interests of French colonialists.

The editorial concluded: In the future, we will still have to go through many hardships and difficulties. But with the heroic spirit of our army and people, with the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, we will surely achieve independence, unity, democracy, and peace, and make the correct and reasonable proposals put forward by Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Geneva Conference, come true.

    越南“人民报”评奠边府解放的重大意义
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”在十三日发表社论，评论奠边府战役胜利的重大意义。
    社论说：越南人民军在三次攻势中，完全歼灭了强固设防的奠边府集团据点的敌军共计一万六千余人。至此，越南西北部完全解放了，具有历史意义的奠边府战役已经得到光辉的胜利。这是越南军民自卫国战争开始以来所获得的最大的军事胜利。
    社论说：敌人在奠边府空降部队，是打算占领越南西北部，重建傀儡“泰族自治邦”，以便在越南各民族之间撒下不和的种子；同时想拚命守住上寮，以及重新占领中国、越南与寮国交界处的广大地区。这是美国干涉者和法国殖民主义战争贩子们所策划的“纳瓦尔计划”的一部分。
    社论谈到奠边府战役胜利的原因说：我们之所以在奠边府取得重大胜利，是因为：有越南劳动党与胡志明主席的英明领导以及越南人民军总司令部的果断而正确的指挥；越南人民军经过政治和军事训练运动以后，干部和战士的政治、军事与技术水平提高了，而在攻势中，他们紧密团结、英勇作战、克服种种困难，同时在全国其他战场上的人民军，密切地配合了奠边府战役；我们的人民（其中大多数是农民）积极参加民工队支援前线；越南、高棉、寮国三国人民的团结和争取自由与独立的决心，法国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民对我们的卫国战争的热烈支持。
    社论指出：我们在奠边府取得的胜利也是正义、自由与和平的胜利。这标志着我们的军民在对帝国主义侵略者进行的长期艰苦抗战中获得了不断的进展。这是给予美国干涉者和法国殖民主义战争贩子们的严重打击。我们在奠边府取得的胜利，使帝国主义者想割断越南平原地区与山区人民之间的联系的阴谋遭到了惨重的失败。这说明：帝国主义者虽然拥有现代化的武器，但由于没有人民的支持，是必然要失败的。这同时说明：世界上没有任何力量（不论它是多么强大）能够征服一个决心争取民族独立、争取过自由与和平生活的权利的民族。
    社论说：美国干涉者和法国殖民主义战争贩子们的阴谋是极为狡猾的，他们在拖延和扩大印度支那战争。美帝国主义者利用法国远征军所遭到的惨败来更进一步地干涉这场“肮脏的战争”，并进一步向法国殖民者的利益进攻。
    社论最后说：今后，我们还要经历许多艰难困苦。但是靠着我们军队和人民的英勇精神，靠着越南劳动党与胡志明主席的英明领导，靠着全世界爱好和平人民的支持，我们一定会取得独立、统一、民主与和平，并且使得出席日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同所提出的正确与合理的建议得以实现。
