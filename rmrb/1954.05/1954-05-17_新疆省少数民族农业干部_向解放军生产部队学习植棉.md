Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi: The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government organized fifty-eight agricultural cadres from Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Mongolian, Tatar, and other ethnic groups to go to the reclamation area on the banks of the Manas River in the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to learn advanced cotton planting techniques from the agricultural production troops.

Last year, the agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region created a large area of high-yield cotton in the Manas River reclamation area, setting an example for cotton farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Labor models from famous cotton-producing areas such as Turpan and Korla visited the reclamation area to learn new cotton planting techniques. This year, after the agricultural cadres of all ethnic groups have learned advanced cotton planting techniques in the reclamation area, they will further guide farmers of all ethnic groups to improve their cotton planting skills.

    新疆省少数民族农业干部
    向解放军生产部队学习植棉
    据新华社乌鲁木齐讯：新疆省人民政府农林厅组织了五十八名维吾尔、哈萨克、回、蒙、塔塔尔等民族的农业干部，到人民解放军新疆军区玛纳斯河畔垦区，向农业生产部队学习先进植棉技术。
    新疆军区农业生产部队去年在玛纳斯河畔垦区创造的棉花大面积丰产，为新疆各族棉农树立了榜样。曾有著名产棉区吐鲁番、库尔勒等地的劳动模范到垦区参观，学习新的植棉技术。今年各族农业干部在垦区学好先进植棉技术后，将进一步指导各族农民提高植棉技术水平。
