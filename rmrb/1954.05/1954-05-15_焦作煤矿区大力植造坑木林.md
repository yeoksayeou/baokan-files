Jiaozuo Coal Mine Area Vigorously Plants Pit Prop Forests
    This spring, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan Province planted more than 230,000 pit prop trees in Yuanyang and Hui counties, exceeding the plan by more than 80,000 trees. In a few years, it will be able to supply the pit props needed by the coal mine. In addition, a nursery has been established, which can cultivate one million seedlings annually. After the spring afforestation ended, the protection and management of forests and nurseries were strengthened, and in conjunction with various counties, forest land surveys were conducted and plans were formulated in preparation for winter afforestation.

    焦作煤矿区大力植造坑木林
    河南省焦作煤矿今春在原阳与辉县共造坑木林二十三万余株，超过计划八万余株。几年后，就可供应煤矿所需的坑木。此外，还设立了一个苗圃，每年可培育树苗一百万株。春季造林结束以后，又加强了林木与苗圃的保护和经营管理，并与各县结合进行林地调查，制定计划，为今冬的造林做了准备。　（魏泽圃）
