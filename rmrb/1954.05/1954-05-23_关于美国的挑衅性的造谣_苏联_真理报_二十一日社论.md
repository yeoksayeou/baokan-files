    On the Provocative Fabrication of the United States
    -- "Pravda" Editorial on the Twenty-First
    Recently, American newspapers have frequently published fabricated news with the aim of confusing public opinion and diverting people's attention from American aggression. Sometimes, these fabrications are even issued by government agencies. The recent publication of some official "documents" in Washington has reached the pinnacle of this practice, one of which the bourgeois press calls an "intelligence (!) report" and the other a "White Paper." The "intelligence report" was drafted by an unnamed "federal" (i.e., government) agency, while the "White Paper" was compiled by the Pentagon (i.e., the US Department of Defense).

    The first fabricated document has a rather resounding name: "New Colonialism in Asia - Chinese and Soviet Penetration into Indochina." The author of this "intelligence report" solemnly states: "During the French army's attack on Liangshan in July 1953," "six Molotov factory trucks" were discovered. In addition, it is said that 18,000 liters of gasoline were also found (obviously, the author of this report believes that the use of gasoline is conclusive evidence of "Soviet penetration"), eight certain lathes, and some guns, but the fabrication experts of the "federal agency" did not dare to insist that these guns were made in the Soviet Union.

    Presumably, the author of the "intelligence report" also felt the ridiculousness of their provocative argument of so-called "Chinese and Soviet penetration into Indochina," so they tried to find a foothold in the wording. They decided to "scientifically" demonstrate the existence of this "penetration," and for this purpose, they targeted the "Moscow University Gazette," a kind of official publication.

    The Washington fabrication experts took an article about the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution from the September 1951 issue of this ordinary university publication, concocted it, and deliberately portrayed this article as if it contained a plan to invade Indochina. The article talked about the well-known theory that the driving force of the Chinese revolution was the working class, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, led by the working class, and these fabrication experts seized on this point to make a big fuss about it.

    They said: "The Moscow University Gazette" put forward (!) the following program of action: First, awaken the nationalistic sentiments of various resident classes; second, instigate the establishment of a national "united front" in which a "wavering national bourgeoisie" and "petty bourgeoisie and its parties" can participate; third, seize (!) the leadership of the "united front" from these two groups to benefit the working class and the Communist Party; fourth, transform the "united front" into a purely worker-peasant organization; fifth, "establish, based on possibilities, a powerful people's liberation army that can fight the enemy under the leadership of the Communist Party."

    What conclusion can be drawn from this?

    It seems that the conclusion can be found in itself. "Aggression against Indochina is carried out by a regime that... adopts the tactics formulated by world communism for establishing satellite regimes and relies heavily on the Soviet Union and China."

    The students of Moscow University must have been laughing at these unfortunate fabrication experts in Washington. These fabrication experts did not hesitate to resort to the most despicable fabrication methods, distorting a three-year-old article about China in the "Moscow University Gazette," in order to justify American interference in the internal affairs of Indochina, even though the article did not mention Indochina at all. But the figures of the American "federal agency" are not limited to tampering with old articles. They fabricated out of thin air a 3,000-word "handbook" supposedly published by the "Chinese People's Volunteers to Aid Vietnam." As the spokesperson of the Chinese delegation to the Geneva Conference said, this document is a complete fabrication.

    The "federal agency's" fabrication did not even impress those bought-and-paid-for bourgeois newspapers in the United States and countries dependent on the United States. The American propagandists for sale fabricated so clumsily that they did not cause even a little bit of echo.

    A day later, the Pentagon, apparently envious of this "federal agency" for having the honor of receiving such dubious distinction, also wanted to show its skills on the propaganda stage, and all of a sudden, fabricated and published three "documents." Like the first counterfeit, these fabricated documents, according to their fabricators, were compiled based on "investigative materials and analysis and research of multifaceted information." But these "documents" have no materials, no analysis, and no research. This is all complete fabrication, the fantasy of foolish minds.

    The fabricators of these lies insist that: "By the end of May 1953, there were several 'Russian corps' in Korea, with organizations ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 people, including anti-aircraft artillery units, medium-caliber artillery regiments, logistics units, and railway units." But the author cannot produce any facts to confirm this unfounded malicious fabrication.

    What is the purpose of the American ruling clique in manufacturing such a large number of lies? According to an Associated Press reporter, the manufacture of these lies has the following "several purposes: first, to tell the Indochinese people what is happening in another Asian country, ... second, to strengthen the strength of the American position, that is, to try to make Britain interested in the issue of joint aid to Indochina, and to use objective examples to illustrate that it is impossible to deal with Asian Reds as equal members on the diplomatic stage."

    It is very obvious that the American government agencies are resorting to fabrication because of their poor situation. The attempt of the American aggressive group to piece together a group to intervene militarily in Indochina has failed. The purpose of manufacturing these lies is not only to cover up America's arrogant and illegal military intervention in Indochina's affairs but also to try to put pressure on its Western European allies who are worried about America's adventurous policy in Asia.

    Every country has a famous saying: rumors do not go far, lies do not live long. Since blackmail and other political and economic pressures have not brought any gains to the American ruling clique, can fabrication be of any use?

    American diplomats and military officers have been exposed more than once as aggressors, adventurers, and blackmailers. Now, they are spreading their notoriety as manufacturers of provocative lies far and wide in the world.

    关于美国的挑衅性的造谣
    ——苏联“真理报”二十一日社论
    最近美国报纸常常刊载一些捏造的消息，其目的在于混淆社会舆论的视听，转移人们对美国侵略行动的注意。有时，这种捏造甚至是政府机关发出的。在这方面达到登峰造极的地步的是最近华盛顿公布的一些官方“文件”，其中的一个文件资产阶级报纸称为“情报（！）报告”，另一个则是“白皮书”。“情报报告”是某一个不愿露面的“联邦”（即政府）机构草拟的，而“白皮书”则是五角大楼（即美国国防部）编成的。
    第一个捏造文件的名称倒是颇响亮的：“亚洲的新殖民主义——中苏两国渗入印度支那”。这个“情报报告”的作者一本正经地说：“一九五三年七月法军进攻谅山的时候”发现了“六辆莫洛托夫工厂的载重汽车”。此外，据说还发现了一万八千公升汽油（显然，这个报告的作者认为，使用汽油是“苏联渗入”的确凿证据），八台某种车床，还有一些枪炮，但“联邦机构”的造谣专家却还不敢把这些枪炮硬说成是苏联制造的。
    大概“情报报告”的作者也觉得他们的所谓
  “中苏两国渗入印度支那”这种挑衅论断的荒谬可笑，便设法在字眼上找寻立足点。他们决定“科学地”论证这种“渗入”的存在，为了这个目的，他们就在“莫斯科大学公报”这样一个机关报上打主意了。
    华盛顿的造谣专家从这个普通的大学机关报的一九五一年九月号中找出一篇关于论述中国人民革命胜利的文章，加以泡制，故意把这篇文章说成仿佛包含着侵略印度支那的计划。这篇文章谈到人所共知的理论，即中国革命的动力是工人阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级与民族资产阶级，而以工人阶级为领导，这些造谣专家就抓住这一点大做其文章。
    他们说：“莫斯科大学公报”提出了（！）下列的行动纲领：第一，唤醒各个居民阶级的民族主义感，第二，煽动建立一个“动摇的民族资产阶级”和“小资产阶级及其政党”可以参加的全国“统一战线”，第三，从这两个集团夺取（！）对“统一战线”的领导权，以利工人阶级和共产党，第四，把“统一战线”变为纯粹的工农组织，第五，
  “根据可能性建立能够在共产党领导下和敌人进行斗争的强大的人民解放军。”
    由此可以得出什么结论来呢？
    看来结论在它本身就可以找到。“对印度支那实行侵略的是这样的一种政权，这种政权……采用的是世界共产主义为建立卫星国政权而制定的策略，并且在很大程度上仰仗着苏联和中国。”
    莫斯科大学的学生想必笑煞华盛顿这些倒霉的造谣专家。这些造谣专家竟不惜采取最卑鄙的捏造手段，歪曲“莫斯科大学公报”中三年前的一篇论述中国的文章，以为美国干涉印度支那内政辩解。虽然这篇文章中关于印度支那只字未提。但是美国
  “某一联邦机关”的人物们并不只限于篡改旧文章。他们竟无中生有地搬出什么据说是“中国人民援越志愿军”出版的三千言的“手册”。正如出席日内瓦会议的中国代表团发言人所说，这个文件是彻头彻尾的捏造事实。
      “联邦机关”的造谣甚至对美国的与依赖美国的国家的那些被收买的资产阶级报刊也没有产生什么印象。卖身的美国宣传家造谣也造得太笨拙了，连一点点回响也没有引起。
    过了一天，五角大楼显然是见到这一“联邦机关”有幸得到这种值得怀疑的荣誉而眼红了，于是也要在宣传舞台上一显自己的身手，一下子就假造和公布了三个“文件”。像第一回的伪造品一样，这次捏造的文件，据它们的编造者说，是根据“调查的材料和对多方面的情报分析与研究”而编制出来的。但是这些“文件”并没有任何的材料，也没有任何的分析与研究。这全是彻头彻尾的捏造、愚蠢的头脑的狂想。
    这些谎言的编造者硬说：“到一九五三年五月底，在朝鲜有若干从六千人到一万二千人编制的
  ‘俄国兵团’，其中包括高射炮部队、中口径炮炮兵团、后勤部队和铁道部队。”但是作者却拿不出任何事实来证实这种毫无根据的恶意的捏造。
    美国统治集团这样大量制造谎言是为了什么呢？据美联社记者说，制造这些谎言有下面“几个目的：第一，要把亚洲另一国家发生的事情告诉印度支那人，……第二，加强美国这种立场的力量，即设法使英国对共同援助印度支那问题发生兴趣，并用客观的例子来说明没有可能把亚洲赤色分子作为外交舞台上的平等成员跟他们打交道。”
    十分明显，美国政府机关由于处境不好，才乞灵于造谣。美国侵略集团拼凑一个集团以便武装干涉印度支那的企图遭到了失败。他们制造这些谎言的目的不但是为了掩饰美国对于印度支那事务的蛮横非法的军事干涉，而且企图借此对它的那些耽心美国在亚洲的冒险方针的西欧盟国施加压力。
    各国都有这样一句有名的谚语：谣言走不远，谎言活不长。既然讹诈以及其他政治和经济的压力都没有使美国统治集团有所收获，难道造谣还能有什么用场吗？
    美国的外交官和军官已经不止一次地暴露为侵略者、冒险分子和讹诈分子。现在，他们又在世界上远扬他们挑衅性谎言的制造者的臭名了。
