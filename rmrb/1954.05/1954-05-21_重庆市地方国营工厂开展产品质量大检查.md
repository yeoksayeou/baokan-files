Chongqing Municipality's local state-owned factories conduct a major inspection of product quality.

More than forty local state-owned and joint state-private factories under the Chongqing Industrial Bureau have begun a major quality inspection. At present, the phenomena of unstable product quality and low quality are quite serious in various factories. For example, the scrap rate of castings at the Chongqing Iron Factory reaches 50%; one-third of the flannel shirts produced by the Chongqing Cotton Weaving Factory in early May did not meet specifications. The paint from the Chongqing Paint Factory turns yellow from white, and yellow doesn't look yellow. In the customer opinion book of the Chongqing Chemical Raw Materials Company's business department, almost all opinions are of this nature. The reasons for the poor quality, in addition to poor machinery and equipment, technical conditions, and chaotic production management, are mainly that many factories have blindly complacent sentiments, feeling that their products are "the best in the Southwest"; shortcomings "are much better than in the past." Some people understand the commercial sector's requirements for exquisite and beautiful products as "merchant viewpoints" and therefore ignore improving quality. Secondly, some factories have the capitalist profit-seeking management style. For example, when the market needed toothbrushes and pencils last year, the Chongqing Xinmin Toothbrush Factory and the China Pencil Factory took the opportunity to send toothbrushes that had been piled up in the warehouse for a long time and pencils made of broken lead to the commercial sector for sale. The Chongqing Industrial Bureau held a meeting of factory directors on May 18 and decided to launch a quality inspection among employees from now until early June to carefully inspect leadership thinking, operating procedures, and inspection systems; re-inspect products stored in warehouses and delivered to the commercial sector, and require that through inspection, the neglect of quality and capitalist management style be corrected, various regulations be improved, and enterprise management be further improved.

    重庆市地方国营工厂开展产品质量大检查
    重庆市工业局所属四十多个地方国营和公私合营工厂开始质量大检查。目前各厂产品质量不稳定、质量低劣的现象相当严重。如重庆铁工厂铸件报废率达百分之五十；重庆棉织厂五月上旬生产的绒衣有三分之一不合规格。重庆油漆厂的油漆，白色变成黄色，黄色又不黄。在重庆市化工原料公司营业部的顾客意见簿上几乎全是这样的意见。质量低劣原因，除了机器设备、技术条件差以及生产管理混乱外，主要是许多工厂有盲目自满情绪，觉得本厂产品是“西南第一”；有缺点“也总比过去好得多”，有人将商业部门要求产品精致美观理解成为“商人观点”，因而漠视提高质量。其次，部分工厂有资产阶级唯利是图的经营作风，如重庆新民牙刷厂和中国铅笔厂在去年市场需要牙刷和铅笔时，乘机把仓库堆积很久不合标准的牙刷和断铅硬制的铅笔送给商业部门销售。重庆市工业局在五月十八日召开所属厂长会议，决定从现在到六月初发动职工展开质量大检查，认真检查领导思想、操作规程和检验制度；重新检验堆存仓库和送交商业部门的产品，要求通过检查，纠正忽视质量和资产阶级经营作风，健全各种规程，进一步提高企业管理。
