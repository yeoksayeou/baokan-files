    Workers in factories and mines in Northwest China are learning from Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, actively studying their work, and improving their technology, resulting in many new inventions and creations. Liu Yongnian, an electrical measurement engineer at the Petroleum Management Bureau Geology Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, successfully trial-produced the first fully automatic electrical measuring instrument in the country in Northwest China before International Labor Day on May 1st. The successful trial production of the fully automatic electrical measuring instrument will further advance the electrical measurement work of China's petroleum industry towards precision and accuracy. All kinds of parts on the fully automatic electrical measuring instrument (including power supply, measurement circuit control, downhole current control, automatic photographic recording and other main parts, communication equipment, and winch cables, etc.) are made of domestic materials, and the price of each unit is two-thirds cheaper than imported goods. At the same time, a single downhole electrical measurement can yield a variety of analytical research data for finding oil layers, which shortens the logging time and increases work efficiency by 350 percent. The medium-sized corn thresher trial-produced by the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Factory has also been successful. This machine is very convenient to use and is very popular among farmers. It can husk an average of one corn cob per second, while it takes 15 seconds to husk one by hand. The factory has produced five units and plans to continue trial-producing small corn threshers. Lei Ziming, a technician, and Zhang Shusen, a technician, of the factory, created a dual-force dual-purpose chuck, which can replace the work of blacksmiths and fitters, and can clamp 40 kinds of workpieces. The work efficiency is twice that of manual operation, and it creates excellent conditions for the future manufacture of 12-row horse-drawn planters. Workers in various textile factories under the Northwest Textile Administration are also actively carrying out technical innovations in labor competitions to improve labor productivity. Zhao Gangzhan, a worker in the opening and cleaning workshop of the Northwest No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, improved the method of removing broken seeds. Originally, it took five minutes to stop the machine to remove broken seeds once, but now it is possible to remove broken seeds without stopping the machine. After this method was promoted in the whole workshop, it can produce 75 more rolls of cotton per day, which basically solves the difficulty that the factory's opening and cleaning equipment is insufficient and the rolls of cotton cannot fully supply the needs of the carding machine. After learning Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, the work efficiency of basic construction workers in the Xi'an area has been greatly improved. When Zhang Fengshan's plasterer team of the 103 Engineering Team of the Northwest Engineering Company renovated the prefabricated line corner model boards, they actively learned technology and increased from more than 20 pieces per day to more than 70 pieces. Zhao Fuquan's plasterer team of Xi'an Construction Engineering Company promoted the assembly line operation method. When four people plastered terrazzo, they plastered 44 square meters a day, exceeding the quota by 85 percent.
    Due to learning Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, many factories have completed and overfulfilled their April production plans. At present, workers in various factories have launched a "Red May" labor competition upsurge, and in the competition, they are using technical innovation as the direction of the competition, striving to complete the May production tasks ahead of schedule.

    西北各地厂矿开展技术革新运动
    西北各地厂矿职工，学习王崇伦的革新精神，积极研究业务，改进技术，出现了不少新的发明创造。中央燃料工业部石油管理总局地质局电测工程师刘永年，“五一”国际劳动节前夕，在西北试制成功了全国第一部全自动电测仪器。全自动电测仪的试制成功，将使我国石油工业的电测工作，进一步走向精密和准确。全自动电测仪（包括电源供给、测量电路控制、下井电流控制、自动照像记录等主要部分和通讯设备以及绞车电缆等）上的各种机件都是用我国自己材料制成的，每一部的价格要比进口货便宜三分之二。同时，下井电测一次，可以得出多种寻找油层的分析研究的资料，这就缩短了测井时间，使工作效率提高百分之三百五十。西北农业机械制造厂试制的中型玉米脱粒机也已成功。这个机器用起来非常方便，很受农民的欢迎。平均一秒钟可以剥掉一个玉米，而用手剥十五秒钟才能剥掉一个。该厂已制出了五部，并且还计划继续试制小型玉米脱粒机。该厂技术工人雷子明和技术员张树森创造了双力两用卡具，这个工具能代替锻工和钳工干活，并可卡活四十种，工作效率比手工操作提高两倍，并为今后制造马拉十二行播种机创造了优良条件。西北纺织管理局所属各纺织厂职工，在劳动竞赛中，也积极进行技术革新，提高劳动生产效率。国营西北第二棉纺厂清花车间工人赵岗站改进了掏破籽的方法，原来掏一次破籽要停车五分钟，现在不停车就可以掏破籽了。这个方法在全车间推广后，每天可多产七十五件花卷，基本上解决了该厂清花设备不足，花卷不能充分供应梳棉机需要的困难。西安地区的基本建设工人学习了王崇伦的革新精神后，工作效率大大提高。西北工程公司一零三工程队瓦工张凤山小组在整修预制线角模型板时，积极学习技术，由原来每天做二十多块提高到七十多块。西安市建筑工程公司瓦工赵福全小组推广了流水作业法，在粉刷水磨石时四个人一天粉刷四十四平方，超过定额百分之八十五。
    由于学习王崇伦革新精神，许多工厂都完成和超额完成了四月份生产计划。目前，各厂职工都掀起了“红五月”劳动竞赛热潮，在竞赛中都将技术革新作为竞赛的方向，争取提前完成五月份生产任务。
