Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 27th: The labor productivity of workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant is improving rapidly. In the first quarter of this year, the labor productivity of each steelworker at Anshan Iron and Steel increased by an average of 36% compared to each quarter of last year; in April, it increased by an average of 0.8% compared to the first quarter. Compared with 1950, the rate of increase is even more staggering. In March of this year, the labor productivity of each steelworker at Anshan Iron and Steel increased by an average of 183% compared to each month in 1950.

Every percentage point increase in the labor productivity of steelworkers contains significant meaning. The aforementioned figures mean that the value of steel produced by the steelmaking plant in the first quarter of this year increased by 36% compared to the quarterly average of last year; the value of steel produced in March increased by 183% compared to the monthly average of 1950.

The rapid increase in the labor productivity of steelworkers is the result of the staff diligently implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, actively promoting advanced Soviet experience, and giving full play to their high level of labor enthusiasm. After learning advanced Soviet experiences such as "high temperature, fast loading, and layered thorough burning" and "fast ingot casting," and using new-style furnace repair machines and other tools, the time it takes to produce each batch of steel is getting shorter and shorter. In March of this year, the time it took to produce each batch of steel at the steelmaking plant was shortened by 13 minutes compared to December of last year. In 1952, a certain open-hearth furnace produced an average of 6.32 tons of steel per square meter of hearth area per day. In February of this year, this open-hearth furnace set a new record of 7.19 tons. With the help and guidance of Soviet experts, the steelmaking plant staff fundamentally transformed open-hearth furnaces and auxiliary refining furnaces, fully tapped the potential of the equipment, and rapidly exceeded the steel production levels of the puppet Manchurian period. They also implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts on extending the life of the front walls and roofs of open-hearth furnaces, increasing the operating time of the furnaces. Currently, the lifespan of open-hearth furnace roofs made of silica bricks at the steelmaking plant has reached more than 180 steelmaking cycles, more than three times longer than the average number in 1950. A certain open-hearth furnace even set a new record of 256 cycles.

The leadership of the steelmaking plant promoted Soviet socialist enterprise management methods and improved the level of enterprise management, which also played a very important role in improving labor productivity. By improving labor organization and using new-style furnace repair machines, the steelmaking plant also saved a lot of labor. From September of last year to March of this year, the plant was able to transfer more than 500 workers to work in other enterprises or leave to study technology.

    鞍钢炼钢厂积极推行苏联先进经验
    炼钢工人劳动生产率迅速提高
    第一季度劳动生产率比去年各季度平均提高百分之三十六
    【新华社鞍山二十七日电】鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂工人的劳动生产率提高得很快。今年第一季度鞍钢每个炼钢工人的劳动生产率，比去年每季度平均提高了百分之三十六；四月份又比第一季度每月平均提高了百分之零点八。如果和一九五零年比较，提高的速度就更加惊人了。今年三月份鞍钢每个炼钢工人的劳动生产率，比一九五零年每月平均提高了百分之一百八十三。
    炼钢厂工人劳动生产率提高的每个百分数，都包含着重要的意义。上述数字意味着炼钢厂今年第一季度生产的钢的价值，比去年各季度平均提高了百分之三十六；三月份生产的钢的价值，比一九五零年每月平均提高了百分之一百八十三。
    炼钢厂工人劳动生产率的迅速提高，是职工们认真执行苏联专家建议、积极推广苏联先进经验、发挥了高度的劳动积极性的结果。炼钢厂职工学习了“高温、快装、分层烧透”和“快速铸锭”等苏联先进经验，并使用了新式补炉机等工具以后，每炼一炉钢的时间越来越短了。今年三月份炼钢厂每炼一炉钢的时间比去年十二月份缩短了十三分钟。某号平炉在一九五二年时，平均每天每一平方公尺的炉底面积生产出的钢是六点三二吨，今年二月，这个平炉创造了七点一九吨的新纪录。炼钢厂职工曾在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，根本改造了平炉和预备精炼炉，充分挖掘了设备的潜在能力，使钢的产量迅速地超过了伪满时期的水平。他们并实行了苏联专家提出的关于延长平炉前墙和炉顶寿命的建议，增加了平炉的作业时间。现在炼钢厂用矽砖做的平炉炉顶寿命，已达到可以炼钢一百八十次以上，比一九五零年的平均次数延长了三倍多。某号平炉并创造了二百五十六次的新纪录。
    炼钢厂的领导方面推行苏联社会主义企业的管理方法，提高企业的管理水平，对提高劳动生产率也起了很重要的作用。由于改善劳动组织和使用新式补炉机等，炼钢厂并节省了很多劳动力。去年九月到今年三月间，这个厂曾因此能够抽出五百多个工人转到别的企业工作或离职学习技术。
