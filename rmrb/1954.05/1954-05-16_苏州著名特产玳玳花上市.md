    Suzhou's Famous Specialty, Seville Orange Flowers, Hit the Market
    Seville orange flowers, a type of tea flower used to bake fragrant tea, have entered the market in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. "Dried Seville Orange Flowers," baked with fresh Seville orange flowers, can be stored for a long time without losing their fragrance and are easy to carry. The area near the scenic Tiger Hill in the suburbs of Suzhou is rich in various tea flowers. Among them, white orchid flowers have an annual output of more than 2,000 dan (1 dan = 50 kg), and can be picked in all seasons. Seville orange flowers have an annual output of more than 3,000 dan. Jasmine flowers have an annual output of more than 15,000 dan. Now is the season for Seville orange flowers to hit the market. The Tiger Hill Tea Flower Purchasing Station, composed of relevant departments such as the Suzhou Cooperatives and the China Tea Company, is currently purchasing them. This year, the Suzhou Tea Factory of the China Tea Company and the Suzhou Cooperative Tea Processing Factory plan to use the purchased tea flowers to bake more than 70,000 dan of fragrant tea, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year. The baked fragrant tea will be supplied to Beijing, Jinan, and various provinces and cities in North and Northeast China, as well as for export. When purchasing tea flowers, the Tiger Hill Tea Flower Purchasing Station educates flower farmers to pick tea flowers in a timely manner and pay attention to removing wilted flowers that have lost their fragrance, improving the quality of tea flowers so that the baked fragrant tea is more fragrant and mellow.

    苏州著名特产玳玳花上市
    江苏省苏州著名特产玳玳花已经上市。玳玳花是用来焙制香茶的一种茶花，用鲜玳玳花烘制的“玳玳花干”，可以长期保存，香味不衰，而且便于携带。苏州市郊名胜虎丘附近地区盛产各种茶花。其中白兰花年产两千多担，四季都可采摘。玳玳花年产三千多担。茉莉花年产一万五千多担。现在正是玳玳花上市季节。苏州市合作社和中国茶业公司等有关部门组成的虎丘茶花收购站正在收购。中国茶业公司苏州茶厂和苏州市合作社茶叶加工厂今年计划用收购的茶花焙制七万多担香茶，比去年增加百分之四十以上。焙制的香茶将供应北京、济南和华北、东北各省、市以及出口。虎丘茶花收购站在收购茶花时，教育养花农民及时采摘茶花，并注意去掉失去香味的残花，提高茶花质量，使焙制的香茶更加香醇。　　　　（新华社）
