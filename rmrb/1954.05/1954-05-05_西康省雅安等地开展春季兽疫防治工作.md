Spring Veterinary Disease Prevention Work Carried Out in Ya'an and Other Areas of Xikang Province

Livestock epidemic prevention personnel in Ya'an, Yingjing, Tianquan, Luding and other counties and Ya'an City in Xikang Province, under the leadership of the local Party committees and people's governments, actively carried out spring veterinary disease prevention work. The Fourth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Tianquan County held a symposium for veterinarians in the district to study veterinary disease prevention work; and organized them to inspect 190 head of cattle in Qianyang, Xingye, and Xiakou villages. Among the 89 head of cattle in Hanjia Village, 47 had diseases of varying degrees of severity, and they prescribed more than 40 doses of medicine to treat these cattle. Through this work, not only were many cattle cured of their diseases, but farmers were also educated to cherish cattle and pay attention to feeding management. Yingjing County organized veterinarians throughout the county to examine 2,480 cattle in 44 villages in 10 townships, of which 184 sick cattle were treated in a timely manner.

Many counties have studied issues such as preventing swine fever and improving feeding management methods through seminars. For example, the Xinglong Township People's Government of Luding County, on the one hand, contacted the county's animal husbandry and veterinary station to mobilize the masses for prevention and treatment, and on the other hand, separately convened village cadres and mass meetings to explain the principles of scientific epidemic prevention, thereby enhancing everyone's confidence in epidemic prevention.

    西康省雅安等地开展春季兽疫防治工作
    西康省雅安、荥经、天全、泸定等县和雅安市等地畜牧防疫工作人员，在当地党委和人民政府的领导下，积极开展春季兽疫防治工作。中共天全县第四区委员会曾召开了全区兽医工作者座谈会，研究兽疫防治工作；并把他们组织起来，到前阳、兴业、下口三村检查了一百九十条耕牛。韩家村的八十九条耕牛中，有四十七条带有轻重程度不同的病，他们配了四十多副药给这些耕牛治疗。通过这次工作，不但治好了不少耕牛的病，同时也教育了农民，爱护耕牛，注意饲养管理。荥经县组织全县兽医在十个乡四十四个村，看了二千四百八十只牛，其中一百八十四头病牛，都及时得到了医治。
    许多县通过座谈会，研究了防治猪瘟和改进饲养管理方法等问题。如泸定县兴隆乡人民政府一方面和县畜牧兽医工作站取得联系，发动群众进行防治，一方面又分别召开了村干部和群众会，说明科学防疫的道理，提高了大家的防疫信心。
