Hegang Jianjing Company conscientiously implements Soviet expert suggestions
    Since the start of the Hegang mine construction project more than a year ago, Soviet experts have offered more than 500 suggestions. These suggestions cover aspects such as project quality, progress, safety, conservation, transportation, welfare, machinery protection, and geological data.

    The Hegang Jianjing Company's conscientious implementation of Soviet expert suggestions has resulted in accelerated project progress, improved project quality, and savings of many materials. For example, during the sinking of the Xing'antai vertical shaft, due to the implementation of a specific expert suggestion, the progress increased from seven or eight meters per month to thirty meters under difficult conditions with over 100 cubic meters of water inflow per hour. Experts guided the Dongshan vertical shaft civil engineering project using advanced Soviet technology, enabling the early installation of the main and auxiliary shaft winches. In winter construction projects such as the United Welfare Building, the "warm shed method" and "heating method" and other advanced Soviet experiences were adopted, ensuring project quality. When the Dongshan vertical shaft bottom loading station began excavation, some cracks appeared in parts of the project due to encountering soft rock layers and cross-sections, as well as a lack of experience. After the expert provided specific technical guidance, the project quality was guaranteed. The wealth saved due to the implementation of expert suggestions is considerable; for example, the Dongshan vertical shaft pump room project alone saved more than 3,800 kilograms of steel. In one year, experts made as many as 81 key safety suggestions for the Dongshan vertical shaft alone, thus preventing many casualties.

    鹤岗建井公司认真贯彻苏联专家建议
    鹤岗矿井建设工程开工一年多来，苏联专家提出了五百多件建议。建议的内容包括工程质量、进度、安全、节约、运输、福利、机械保护、地质资料等方面。
    鹤岗建井公司认真贯彻苏联专家建议的结果，加快了工程进度，提高了工程质量，节约了许多材料。如兴安台竖井井筒掘进时，由于贯彻了专家某项建议，在一小时涌水一百多立方公尺的艰难条件下，由月进七、八公尺提高到三十公尺。专家指导东山竖井土建工程用苏联先进技术施工，使该井主、副井绞车提早安装。在冬季施工的联合福利大楼等土建工程中，因为采用了“暖棚法”“加热法”等苏联先进经验，保证了工程质量。东山竖井井底车场开始发?时，由于遇到软岩层和断面，以及缺乏经验，部分工程出现了裂缝等现象，后经专家在技术上作了具体指导，便保证了工程质量。由于贯彻专家建议而节约的财富是很大的，其中仅东山竖井水泵房工程就节约了钢筋三千八百多公斤。在一年中，专家仅对东山竖井所提的安全方面的关键性的建议就达八十一件，因而防止了许多伤亡事故的发生。
