To Maintain the Armistice Agreement and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
Li Sang-cho Sends a Letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
Rejecting the So-Called Proposals of the Swedish and Swiss Members to Sabotage the Armistice Agreement

Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on May 20, instructed to provide the Korean-Chinese side's response to the letter sent by the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the Military Armistice Commission on May 7. The full text of Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho's letter is as follows:

Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission:

We have received the letter from the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dated May 7, 1954. We would like to offer the following response to this letter.

I. The Swedish and Swiss members stated in their letter that "The United Nations Command has, from the beginning, taken a broad view of its obligations, allowing the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in its military control area to conduct full supervision." This is completely inconsistent with the facts. According to multiple reports from the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in South Korea, as well as two reports submitted to the Military Armistice Commission by the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on April 15 and April 30, 1954, respectively, the salient fact is that the United Nations Command has, in every way, restricted and obstructed the activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at various ports in South Korea. They failed to provide the teams with advance reports in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements, prohibited the teams from boarding ships for inspection, prohibited the teams from opening containers for inspection, and even openly prohibited the teams from entering ports to perform their duties, and so on. The Swedish and Swiss members have not publicly denied these facts, and even the United Nations Command dares not publicly deny them. This proves that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in South Korea, while carrying out their legitimate activities in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, have failed to conduct so-called "full inspections" due to the consistent and deliberate restrictions and obstructions by the United Nations Command.

II. According to the aforementioned reports, the United Nations Command has freely violated the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement, bringing in various types of reinforcing combat aircraft in excess of the permitted amounts, refusing to report the sub-types of combat aircraft, bringing in military reinforcements through areas other than the designated ports, and refusing to report and refusing inspection of large quantities of imported reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, ammunition parts, disassembled parts, and components, in order to increase military strength and maintain the instability of the Korean armistice. These facts are known to all four members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at the relevant ports in South Korea. While the United Nations Command is attempting to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Swedish and Swiss members, on May 4, 1954, issued a joint statement to the Military Armistice Commission, completely distorting and defending these facts at length based solely on the one-sided claims of the United Nations Command, and claiming that the United Nations Command's illegal actions "should be excused." We cannot but express our regret for this attitude of the Swedish and Swiss members, which is detrimental to the dignity of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

III. It should be pointed out that the Swedish and Swiss members, in their letter of May 7, stated that the Korean-Chinese side's behavior of "strictly reporting combat materials passing through the ports in its military control area" is a position that any party to the armistice should adhere to. However, in their letter, the Swedish and Swiss members referred to the Korean-Chinese side's strict implementation of the Armistice Agreement as being "rigid," saying that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in the northern ports conducted "very few random inspections" other than "appropriately reported combat materials." Does the truth conform to this attack?

Since there should be no large consumption or damage of military materials during the armistice period, the Korean-Chinese side has conducted very little replacement of combat materials and rotation of personnel since the armistice. Any such rotation and replacement has been carried out through designated ports under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, and accurate and detailed reports have been submitted to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in advance in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements. This has been fully proven by the various audits of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the reports of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in the north. When the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in the north did not conduct rotation and replacement, and therefore could not submit reports to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, they also conducted frequent random inspections day and night. When the teams deemed it necessary, they boarded vehicles for inspection and opened carriages and containers that were not carrying combat materials for inspection, without ever being restricted or obstructed. They even inspected inland railway stations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea many times, where it was fundamentally impossible to reflect any rotation or replacement. From August 18, 1953, when the northern teams began working, to May 10, 1954, a total of 932 random inspections were carried out. Therefore, the allegations in the aforementioned letter from the Swedish and Swiss members that it was difficult to conduct random inspections in the north, that very few were conducted, and that "the new methods recently adopted by the United Nations Command...are almost exactly the same as those used by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers from the beginning" are fundamentally inconsistent with the facts. Describing the United Nations Command's so-called "new methods," which aim to completely stop the Neutral Nations Supervisory activities in South Korea, as being "exactly the same" as the Korean-Chinese side's methods can only serve to cover up the United Nations Command's illegal actions, and is therefore inconsistent with the neutral status and impartial position of the neutral nations' members.

IV. The Korean-Chinese side has always believed that the armistice in Korea should lead to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, in the Korean armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side advocated prohibiting the import of any military personnel and combat materials into Korea after the armistice. However, in order to maintain and increase its military strength in South Korea after the armistice, the United Nations Command insisted on using many ports to carry out large-scale so-called rotations and replacements. In order to achieve the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world, the Korean-Chinese side agreed to allow both sides to use five designated ports for limited rotation and replacement after the armistice, under the principle of stopping the entry of reinforcing military forces from outside Korea and under the condition that the replacement was limited to combat materials that had been damaged or consumed during the armistice period. It is clear that in order to maintain the stability of the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the import and export of combat materials into and out of Korea during the armistice period should not be in large quantities, and since it is during the armistice period, there does not seem to be any need to replace every damaged or consumed combat material. Therefore, the Korean-Chinese side only carried out a small amount of rotation and replacement after the armistice. This position and actual action of the Korean-Chinese side reflects our strict adherence to the letter and spirit of Items E and F of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement. This is supported and praised by anyone who cares about the stability of the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and it should also be supported by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, including the Swedish and Swiss members, which is responsible for supervising the armistice. As for which of the five designated ports the Korean-Chinese side uses when carrying out rotation and replacement, since the amount of rotation and replacement is small, that is entirely the Korean-Chinese side's own business and no one else can interfere. In fact, even the United Nations Command, which is carrying out a large amount of rotation and replacement, does not conduct equal rotation and replacement activities at all the designated ports in South Korea. According to the reports of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in South Korea, the activities at the Gangneung port in South Korea are also very few.

V. Due to the exposure of a large number of facts about the United Nations Command's violation of the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement, the United Nations Command is further strengthening its restrictions on the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in South Korea and is actively plotting to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, thereby undermining the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement. This situation is making the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's situation in the South Korean region increasingly worse. On April 15, 1954, the United Nations Command unilaterally announced a "new method" for reporting rotation and replacement at various ports in South Korea, forcing the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to implement the "new method," stipulating that the teams "are only allowed to inspect what has been reported to the teams, and have no right to inspect what has not been reported," "are not allowed to enter the port without the accompaniment of military police and liaison officers," and stipulating that the teams must report the inspection results to the port authorities for review after each inspection. The intent of these regulations is very clear, that is, any combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition that are brought in, as long as the United Nations Command does not report it to the teams, the teams have no right to intervene. Even if the import is reported to the teams, inspection is not allowed without the supervision of the military police; as for the permitted inspection, the inspection results must be reported to the port authorities for review before reporting to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Obviously, the implementation of this so-called "new method" will make the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in South Korea exist only in name, making their supervisory work virtually impossible.

On the same day, General Lacey, Senior Member of the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, slandering, threatening, and attacking the commission, claiming that "the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has been paralyzed to the extent that it cannot perform the obligations it has undertaken as stated in the provisions of the Armistice Agreement," and asserting that it "will never be able to fulfill all of its obligations in the future." General Lacey's unfounded and unreasonable judgment of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as well as the United Nations Command's so-called "new method" regarding rotation and replacement, fully exposes the United Nations Command's sinister intentions to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, thereby undermining the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Under this situation, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should take concerted action to safeguard the integrity of the Armistice Agreement, safeguard the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, solemnly expose the United Nations Command's continued violation of the Armistice Agreement, in order to seek the stability of the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and should not instead demand the revision of the Armistice Agreement, so that the United Nations Command's plot to undermine the provisions of the Armistice Agreement concerning the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is encouraged, and the foundation of the Korean armistice is affected.

VI. Based on the above, in order to safeguard the integrity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to safeguard the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its right to perform its legitimate duties, the Korean-Chinese side cannot accept the Swedish and Swiss members' proposal to revise the Armistice Agreement and change the three ports of Chongjin, Hungnam, and Sinanju on the Korean-Chinese side. Therefore, I am instructed to reject this proposal. We believe that the responsibility of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should resolutely continue, and the United Nations Command's plot to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement should be exposed in a timely and widespread manner by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and resolutely opposed, in order to force the United Nations Command to stop carrying out this plot. Only in this way is the right path to strive for the stability of the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    为维护停战协定和中立国监察委员会
    李相朝致函中立国监察委员会
    拒绝瑞典瑞士委员的破坏停战协定的所谓建议
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将五月二十日致函中立国监察委员会，奉命对中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员五月七日致军事停战委员会的信提出朝中方面的答复，李相朝中将信件的全文如下：中立国监察委员会：
    我们收到了中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员一九五四年五月七日的来信。对于这封来信，我们愿意提出如下的答复。
    一、瑞典委员和瑞士委员在来信中说：“联合国军方面从开始便对其义务采取了广义的看法，让驻在其军事控制地区的中立国视察小组得以进行充分的监察。”这是完全不符合事实的。根据在南朝鲜的中立国视察小组的多次报告，以及中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员在一九五四年四月十五日和四月三十日先后向军事停战委员会提出的两个报告，显著的事实是：联合国军方面百般限制、阻挠中立国视察小组在南朝鲜各口岸的活动，不根据停战协定与双方协议向小组提出事先报告，不准小组上船视察，不准小组开箱视察，甚至公然禁止小组进入港口执行职司等等。对于这些事实，不仅瑞典委员和瑞士委员未曾公开否认，就是联合国军方面也是不敢公开否认的。这就证明，在南朝鲜的中立国视察小组在根据停战协定来进行他们的合法活动时，由于联合国军方面一贯蓄意的限制和阻挠，未能进行所谓的“充分的视察”。
    二、根据上述各种报告，联合国军方面曾放手违反停战协定的有关规定，超额运进多种类型的、增援性的作战飞机，拒绝报告作战飞机的副型，经由指定口岸以外的地区运入军事增援，拒绝报告并拒绝视察大量运入的增援性作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器、弹药的散件、拆散件和零件，以便增加军力，保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态。这些事实是中立国监察委员会四个委员和在南朝鲜有关口岸的中立国视察小组的组员所共知。当联合国军方面正在力图破坏中立国监察委员会之际，瑞典委员和瑞士委员竟于一九五四年五月四日向军事停战委员会提出联合声明，对这些事实，完全根据联合国军方面片面之词加以冗长的曲解和辩护，并认为联合国军方面的违法行为“应当原谅”。对于瑞典委员和瑞士委员的这种有损于中立国监察委员会的尊严的态度，我们不能不表示遗憾。
    三、应该指出，瑞典委员和瑞士委员在其五月七日来信中所称朝中方面“严格报告通过其军事控制地区各口岸的作战物资”的行为，是任何缔约停战的一方所应该坚持的立场。但是，瑞典委员和瑞士委员却在他们的来信中指称，朝中方面这种严格执行停战协定的办法“死板”，说在北方口岸的中立国视察小组除了“恰当地报告了的作战物资以外”，“抽查监察只进行了极少的几次”。究竟事实与这种攻击是否相符呢？
    由于停战期间不应有大量军事物资的消耗毁损，因此自停战以来，朝中方面只进行了很少的作战物资的替换和人员的轮换。任何这种轮换和替换，都经过指定口岸在中立国视察小组的监督下进行，并根据停战协定和双方协议，事先向中立国视察小组提出了准确详细的报告。这是中立国监察委员会的各次审定与在北方的各中立国视察小组的报告所完全证明了的。驻在北方的各中立国视察小组，在朝中方面不进行轮换替换，因而就不能向中立国视察小组提出报告时，也进行经常的白天和夜间的抽查。在小组认为有必要时，他们就上车视察，并打开并非载运作战物资的车厢与并非装有作战物资的容器进行视察，从没有遭受过限制和阻挠。甚至他们曾多次视察过根本不可能反映任何轮换和替换情况的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内地车站。自一九五三年八月十八日北方各小组开始工作起，至一九五四年五月十日，共进行了九百三十二次的抽查。由此可见，瑞典委员和瑞士委员上述来信中所说的在北方要进行抽查很困难，而且只进行了极少的几次，以及“联合国军方面最近采用的新办法……与朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面一开始即使用的办法几乎是完全一样的”这些指控，是根本与事实不符的。将联合国军方面旨在完全停止在南朝鲜的中立国监察活动的所谓“新办法”，说成是和朝中方面的办法“完全一样”的指控，只能起掩护联合国军的违法行为的作用，因而就与中立国委员的中立身份和公正立场不相宜。
    四、朝中方面一贯认为朝鲜的停战应该导致朝鲜问题的和平解决。因此，在朝鲜停战谈判中，朝中方面就曾主张停战后禁止以任何军事人员与作战物资运进朝鲜。而联合国军方面为了保持并增加停战后在南朝鲜的军事力量，则坚持要求使用许多口岸进行大量的所谓轮换、替换的主张。为了争取全世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战的实现，朝中方面在停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事力量的原则下并在将替换限于只是停战期间毁坏、耗损的作战物资的条件下，同意在停战后，双方可以使用五个指定口岸，来进行有限制的轮换和替换。很显然，为了保持朝鲜停战的稳定以利朝鲜问题的和平解决，在停战期间作战物资的进出朝鲜不应该是数量很大的，而且既然是在停战期间，也看不出有任何必要一定要对每一毁坏、耗损的作战物资进行替换。因此，停战后朝中方面只进行少量的轮换和替换。朝中方面的这种主张和实际行动，正是反映了我方对停战协定第十三款寅项、卯项的文字与精神的严格遵守。这是为任何关心朝鲜停战的稳定、关心朝鲜问题和平解决的人们所拥护与赞扬的，这而且是应当为负有监督停战的责任的中立国监察委员会，包括瑞典委员和瑞士委员在内，所支持的。至于朝中方面因为轮换和替换少，在进行轮换和替换时使用五个指定口岸中的那几个口岸，那完全是朝中方面本身的事情，不容别人过问。事实上，就是正进行着大量轮换和替换的联合国军方面，在南朝鲜各指定口岸所进行的轮换和替换活动也不相等。根据在南朝鲜的中立国视察小组的报告，南朝鲜江陵口岸的活动也是非常少的。
    五、由于联合国军方面违反停战协定有关规定的大量事实被揭发，联合国军方面正在更进一步加强他们对于在南朝鲜的中立国视察小组的限制，并积极图谋破坏中立国监察委员会，从而破坏停战协定的有关条款。这种情况，就使中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜地区的遭遇日益恶化。一九五四年四月十五日联合国军在南朝鲜各口岸片面宣布了一个关于报告轮换、替换的“新办法”，强制各中立国视察小组执行“新办法”，规定小组“只准许视察已报告小组的东西，无权视察没有报告的东西”，“没有宪兵与联络官的陪同，不准进入港口”，并规定小组于每次视察后必须将视察结果报告口岸当局。这些规定的意图是十分明显的，就是说任何作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器、弹药的运入，只要联合国军不报告小组，小组就无权过问。就是报告了小组的运入，如无宪兵的监视也不准视察；至于被准许的视察又必须在将视察结果向中立国监察委员会报告之前，先报告口岸当局审定。显然地这种所谓“新办法”的实施，将使住在南朝鲜的各中立国视察小组徒具形式，使他们的监察工作实际上成为不可能。
    与此同一天，联合国军方面军事停战委员会首席委员拉西将军更致函中立国监察委员会，对委员会进行诽谤、威胁和攻击，声称“中立国监察委员会已瘫痪到不能执行停战协定条款中陈述的它所承担的义务的那种程度”，并断言它“今后也决不能履行其所承担的全部义务”。拉西将军对于中立国监察委员会这种毫无根据的蛮横论断，以及联合国军方面的所谓关于轮换和替换的“新办法”，完全暴露了联合国军方面蓄谋破坏中立国监察委员会，从而破坏停战协定有关条款的险恶用心。在这种情况之下，中立国监察委员会应该采取一致行动来维护停战协定的完整，维护中立国监察委员会，严正地揭露联合国军方面继续违反停战协定的行为，以谋朝鲜停战的稳定，并有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决，而不应该反来要求修改停战协定，使联合国军方面破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款、破坏中立国监察委员会的阴谋受到鼓励，使朝鲜停战的基础受到影响。
    六、根据上述，为了维护朝鲜停战协定的完整，为了维护中立国监察委员会的存在及其执行合法职司的权利，对于瑞典委员和瑞士委员关于修改停战协定、改换朝中方面清津、兴南和新安州三个口岸的建议，朝中方面是完全不能接受的。因此，我奉命拒绝这个建议。我们认为中立国监察委员会的责任应当坚决继续下去，联合国军方面破坏中立国监察委员会、破坏停战协定有关条款的阴谋，应该受到中立国监察委员会及时的、广泛的揭露和坚决的反对，来迫使联合国军方面停止进行这种阴谋。只有这样，才是有利于争取朝鲜停战的稳定并有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决的正当道路。
