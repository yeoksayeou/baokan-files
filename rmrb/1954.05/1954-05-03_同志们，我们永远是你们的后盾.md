    Comrades, We Will Always Be Your Backing
    National Railway Labor Model Zhao Lianzhong

    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhao Lianzhong is a bridge worker with 31 years of experience and a member of the Chinese Communist Party. He is currently a foreman in the steel beam workshop of the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory under the Ministry of Railways. After liberation, he created wealth worth hundreds of millions of yuan for the country with his great wisdom and selfless labor. Therefore, since 1950, he has been continuously rated as a labor model in Liaoxi, Northeast, Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, and the whole country. On April 14th of this year, he was invited to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition." The following is a letter he wrote to the Volunteer Army comrades after arriving in Beijing. Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:
    To tell you the truth, this is my third time in Beijing. However, every time I feel that Beijing is different from the past, and this impression is particularly strong this time. Beijing, the heart of the motherland, the place where Chairman Mao lives, is becoming more and more magnificent and lovely. The state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory is installing machinery and will soon be put into production; the newly built three theaters have already started performing programs. The Guangqiao Grand Theater alone can accommodate more than 1,700 people, and after the show, all the audience can leave in three minutes. In addition, more than 60 basic construction sites in the city have also started construction, including the Soviet Exhibition Hall, the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory and the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, as well as the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, the Institute of Geology, and the Medical College...; I heard that there is also a children's hospital built especially for children. On April 24th, we went to the Summer Palace in the western suburbs. As soon as you leave Xizhimen, you can see that the road is twice as wide as before, and there are many more buildings on both sides of the road, including Renmin University and the Central University for Nationalities... Seeing these, and thinking about the "universal tool tire" created by Wang Chonglun and the "anti-surrounding plate" created by Zhang Mingshan that I saw at the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition"...; my heart couldn't help but return to our factory, as if I saw with my own eyes the enthusiasm of the workers working next to the machines, and saw the increased production plan they put forward to welcome "May Day." I really want to run back to the factory immediately, operate the machines, and offer some gifts for our working people's holiday!
    Comrades, why do I love labor and my factory so much! I grew up in a rural area near Shanhaiguan. My father died when I was ten years old, and my mother died when I was eleven. My parents were both forced to death by life. Before my father died, he cried and said to me: "We don't have a family, and there aren't even four households. What should you do after I die!" From the age of eleven, I worked for landlords, and it was not until I was eighteen that I managed to get into the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory. At that time, the factory was managed by a British man. Later, the factory was owned by the Japanese, Americans, and the Kuomintang. However, no matter who owned the factory, we workers always ate chaff and vegetable leaves. My salary of four cents when I joined the factory never increased, it just changed the bills! After liberation, everything changed. The workers became the masters of the factory, and all my enthusiasm for work came. I was thinking day and night about how to tap potential, find tricks, and build more bridges to connect the mountains and rivers of our country. At the end of last year, after studying the Party's general line for the transition period, I could see even further, and I became even more energetic in my work. In January of this year, I participated in the Qinhuangdao City Labor Model Conference. At the conference, I heard that Wang Chonglun from Anshan Iron and Steel Company had completed more than four years of production tasks in one year, creating a lot of wealth for our country. I made up my mind to learn from Wang Chonglun. Coincidentally, in February, we held a National Bridge Manufacturing Industry Product Exhibition here. At the exhibition, I saw the performance of the Fengtai Bridge Factory's tire-type pressure columns. At that time, I remembered the scene of our factory using manual labor to press the columns. Using manual labor to press the columns not only had low work efficiency, but also the quality of the products was not good. For those few days, I couldn't sleep well, thinking about how to transform this tire-type pressure column method, so that it could meet the needs of our factory and further improve work efficiency. I studied it once, and failed; I studied it again, and failed again. On the third day, I carefully checked the reasons for the failure. When I returned home at night, I cut a few more patterns with paper, sewed them together, and compared them. As a result, the experiment was successful. This tire-type pressure column method is to install the tire on a hydraulic press, and use hydraulic power to press the column simply by turning on the button. In the past, using manual labor, an average of only 60 columns could be pressed per day, but now more than 250 columns can be pressed per day, and the work efficiency has increased by more than four times compared to before. Comrades, in March, our factory accepted more than 60 bridge production tasks, and several of them will be sent to you to support the Korean people in restoring their homeland. In the manufacture of these bridges, the tire-type pressure column played a big role. Our task was completed ahead of schedule, and the bridges manufactured for the Korean people will be shipped soon. I think you will see them when you arrive in Korea!
    Comrades, I also want to tell you that our factory began to expand in June last year, and it was fully put into production on February 7th of this year. After the expansion, the annual production of steel beams will be one and a half times more than in the past, and the production has been completely mechanized.
    In the past, we had to use manual labor to transport steel, which was inefficient and dangerous. Now, electric cranes have been installed. The crane walks back and forth on the ceiling beam, and can lift 30 tons of steel at once!
    Dear comrades, after the factory expansion was put into production, the workers' production enthusiasm was even higher. I think it's almost the same as when you first arrived in Korea with only rifles, machine guns, and a few cannons, and then you had airplanes and tanks. With new weapons, you can fight even better; with new machinery and equipment, we must also produce more and better bridges. In the past, we could only manufacture bridges with a span of 30 meters. Now, we can manufacture bridges with huge spans like the Xiangjiang Bridge and the Hanshui Railway Bridge. In addition, we can also manufacture powerful bridge erectors and "Derrick" type cranes. The bridge erector can lift 40 tons of weight at once, and can build a 32-meter bridge in a very short time, which is much more efficient than in the past! The main pole of the "Derrick" type crane is 46 meters high and can also lift tens of tons of steel. We have manufactured these machines with our own hands, which have supported the Xiangjiang Bridge, the Tianlan Railway, the Chengyu Railway..., and now, we are supporting the huge project of the Hanshui Railway Bridge! Comrades, don't worry! If American imperialism and Syngman Rhee really dare to provoke a war again, we guarantee to support you with all our strength. In the past, the enemy did not blow up our steel transportation line, and in the future, they will never be able to! (Written by Wang Ting)

### 同志们，我们永远是你们的后盾

    同志们，我们永远是你们的后盾
    全国铁路劳动模范　赵连仲
    编者按：赵连仲同志是一个三十一年工龄的桥梁工人、中国共产党党员。现在是中央铁道部山海关桥梁工厂钢梁车间的领工员。解放后，他曾以高度智慧和忘我劳动给国家创造了价值数亿元的财富。因此，自一九五○年起，他连续被评为辽西、东北、秦皇岛市、河北和全国的铁路劳动模范。今年四月十四日，他被邀请到北京参加“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的开幕典礼。下面，是他到北京后写给志愿军同志的一封信。亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    说起来，我已经是第三次来北京了。可是，每次都觉着北京和过去不一样了，这一次这种印象就特别深，北京这祖国的心脏，毛主席居住的地方是越来越雄伟可爱了。国营北京第一棉纺织厂正在安装机器，很快就要投入生产；新建的三座影剧院已经开始上演节目，光天桥大剧场就能容下一千七百多人，散场后，观众三分钟就可以全部走完。还有，全市六十多个基本建设工地也都开了工，有苏联展览馆，国营北京第二棉纺织厂和北京制药厂，也有北京航空学院、地质学院、医学院……；听说还有专为孩子们盖的儿童医院呢。四月二十四日，我们到西郊去游颐和园。一出西直门，就可以看到公路比过去宽了一倍，公路两旁的楼房，比过去多得多了，又是人民大学，又是中央民族学院……，看到了这些，再联想到我在“鞍钢技术革新展览会”上看到的王崇伦创造的“万能工具胎”，张明山创造的“反围盘”……；我的心不由得就又回到了我们的工厂，好像又亲眼看到了工友们在机器旁边劳动着的那股劲头，看到了他们为迎接“五一”提出来的增产计划，我真想马上跑回工厂，操纵机器，为咱们劳动人民的节日献一些礼物！
    同志们，我为什么这样热爱劳动，热爱自己的工厂呢！我从小生长在山海关附近的一个农村里，十岁死去了爹，十一岁又死去了妈，爹妈都是硬叫生活逼死的呀。爹临断气前哭着对我说：“咱没有一家，也没有四户，我死了你该怎么办！”十一岁起，我就跟地主家扛活，十八岁才托了个面子走进了山海关桥梁工厂。那时候，工厂是一个英国人在当总管，以后，工厂又归了日本人、美国人和国民党。不过，工厂不管归谁，咱们工人总是吃糠咽菜，我入厂时候的四毛钱薪金，一直没有增加，只不过是变了变票子！解放了，一切都变了，工人成了工厂的主人，我的工作劲头全都来了。白天黑夜都在捉摸着怎样挖潜力、找窍门，多造一些桥梁，把咱们国家的山山水水都联结起来。去年年底，学习了党在过渡时期的总路线以后，眼光就看得越发远了，工作起来也越有精神。今年一月间，我参加了秦皇岛市的劳动模范大会，在会上听说鞍山钢铁公司有个王崇伦，他一年就完成了四年多的生产任务，给咱们国家创造了很多财富。我拿定主意非向王崇伦学习不可。碰巧，二月间我们这里又开了个全国桥梁制造工业产品展览会，在会上我看到了丰台桥梁工厂胎型压立柱的表演。当时我就想起我们厂子里用人力压立柱的情景，用人力压立柱，不光是工作的效率低，产品的质量也不好。那几天，我怎么也睡不好觉，捉摸着怎样把这个胎型压立柱的办法再改造一下，既适合我们厂子里的需要，也能进一步提高工作效率。研究一次，失败了；再研究一次，又失败了。到了第三天，我仔细检查了一下失败的原因，夜间回到家里，又用纸剪了几个样子，缝过来，对过去，结果试验成功了。这一胎型压立柱的办法，是把胎型安装在水压机上，只用开动电钮，就可用水力来压立柱。过去用人力，平均每天只能压六十多根，现在每天就可压二百五十多根，工作效率比先前提高了四倍还要多。同志们，三月份我们厂子里就接受了六十多道桥梁的生产任务，这里面有好几道还要送到你们那里，支援朝鲜人民恢复家园的。在制造这些桥梁中，胎型压立柱起了很大的作用，我们的任务提前完成了，给朝鲜人民制造的桥梁很快就要起运了，到了朝鲜，我想你们也会看到的！
    同志们，还要告诉你们，咱们的工厂从去年六月间开始扩建，到今年二月七日已经完全投入生产了。扩建以后，每年就要比过去增产一倍半的钢梁，生产也全部机械化了。
    过去，咱们搬运钢材得使用人力，工作效率低，也很危险。现在，安装了电力天车，天车在天梁上走过来，走过去，一下子就可以吊起三十吨重的钢材！
    亲爱的同志们，工厂扩建投入生产以后，工人们的生产热情就更高了，我看就和你们才到朝鲜只有步枪机枪和不多的大炮，以后有了飞机、坦克那个心情差不多。你们有了新的武器，仗就打得更漂亮；我们有了新的机器设备，也一定要生产出更多、更好的桥梁。过去我们只能制造三十公尺跨度的桥梁，现在就是像湘江大桥、汉水铁桥那样巨大跨度的桥梁也能制造了。此外，还能制造效力强大的架桥机和“德立克”式的起重机。架桥机一下子可以吊起四十吨重的东西，只要很短的时间就能架成一座三十二公尺的桥梁，比过去的工作效率提高得多了！“德立克”式起重机的主杆就有四十六公尺那么高，也可以吊起几十吨重的钢铁。我们亲手制造出来这些机器，过去曾经支援过湘江大桥、天兰铁路、成渝铁路……，现在，我们又在支援着汉水铁桥的巨大工程！同志们，你们放心吧！美帝国主义和李承晚要是真的敢重新挑起战争，那我们保证全力来支援你们。过去敌人没有把我们的钢铁运输线炸断，今后更永远不能了！（王庭代笔）
    四月二十五日
