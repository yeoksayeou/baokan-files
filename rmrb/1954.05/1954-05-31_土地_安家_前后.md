　　Before and After Land "Settles Down"
　　By Our Correspondent　Ji Xichen
　　I
　　The Miao peasant Li Shizhang's family had been farming for generations, but their mountain land, like that of other Miao farmers living in the Triangle Field Village, had always been without a "home."

　　In the winding and layered Miao Mountains, when spring arrived, in the misty and deep mountain forests, he and groups of three or five Miao men and women could often be seen carrying knives, matches, and seeds, rushing into the dense forests to chop, dig, and set the mountain forests on fire. The soaring flames roared with the wind across the mountains and fields, burning until there was nothing more to burn, or until rain extinguished the fire. People then began to sow seeds on the ash-covered land. Because they lacked cattle and farm tools, after burning these mountain lands, they neither plowed nor harrowed nor applied fertilizer, but simply scattered the seeds on the soil, waiting for the harvest. After planting this way for a year or two, seeing that the land was exhausted, they would abandon this "land" and move to another hillside, burning the mountain again, destroying the forest, cultivating one season, and planting one season. The land was never fixed, and they cultivated the land in the mountains and fields year after year by the method of "slash-and-burn" farming, "chasing the mountain for food."

　　In the spring of 1951, the Leishan County People's Government called on Miao farmers to change their production methods and cultivate the land in a fixed location. Li Shizhang was very happy to hear this, but he didn't believe it. At night, he lay in his "grass bedding," puffing on his pipe, thinking: Yes! What the work team comrades said makes sense, "Plant a mountain slope, only harvest a small pot," and it also causes many fires and floods… But what else can we do if we don't burn the mountain? Where can we buy farm tools in these deep mountains? How can we dig the land with empty hands? The most urgent thing is that sowing is just around the corner, and his family of several people doesn't even have a mattock! Thinking of this, he said to himself in distress:

　　"This has been passed down from generation to generation, it won't be easy to change! Anyway, I'm going to burn the mountain tomorrow."

　　The next day, as soon as the east turned red, Li Shizhang went up the mountain with his knife. He walked into a forest where the branches and leaves were completely intertwined, singing as he "whistled" and felled trees. The sound of the axe and the singing broke the silence of the mountain forest. As he was chopping, he suddenly heard someone shouting from afar: "Who is chopping the mountain there?" He looked up and saw that it was Comrade Li Hao from the work team. Li Shizhang quickly dropped his axe and replied with a question: "Why are you up the mountain too?"

　　"I just came back from the county. Don't run around chopping the mountain anymore. Chairman Mao has sent a large number of iron farm tools to help our Miao people improve production!" Comrade Li Hao walked over and patted him on the arm, excitedly saying: "As soon as I received the letter yesterday, I rushed to the county overnight, and look, haven't I brought the farm tools now?"

　　"Ah! Now there's a way to produce." Li Shizhang was both surprised and happy, and immediately ran out of the mountain forest with Comrade Li as if flying. When he saw more than ten loads of brand-new, shiny iron plows, iron shares, and hoes, he was so excited that he didn't know what to say for a moment. His heart was pounding, and his hands touched this one and then that one, wishing he could use them to turn over the land under his feet right away.

　　The courtyard of the village office was crowded with people looking at the farm tools. Old men wrapped in black headscarves, women wearing purple pleated skirts, and young girls... They were all beaming as if they had come to attend some kind of celebration, and those who couldn't get in stood on the streets on both sides of the entrance, talking and laughing in groups of three or five.

　　Li Shizhang happily squeezed into the crowd, sometimes walking from the courtyard to the street, and sometimes turning back from the street to the courtyard, wanting to talk to someone and share his joy.

　　"Did you see that? Since I can remember, this is the first time I've seen so many!"

　　"Who hasn't! I ask you, how can the Communist Party and Chairman Mao even have this matter on their minds?" An old woman who was deeply moved wiped her moist eyes with her sleeve and said, "He is really worried about us!"

　　"Yes! What difficulties don't they care about!" Li Shizhang counted on his fingers, one by one, loudly as if afraid others wouldn't hear: "Who sent relief grain when we had nothing to eat? It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Who sent winter clothes when we had nothing to wear? It was still the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have sent farm tools, they take care of us even more thoughtfully than our own parents!"

　　"Then, are you still going to chop the mountain in the future?" Li Shichun, standing next to him, asked him.

　　"With farm tools, who would still produce that way?"

　　II

　　In the early morning, when the rising sun awakened the sleeping earth with joyful golden light, people had just started working in the fields, but Li Shizhang had already turned over a large piece of land, still retaining traces of spring snow, in the dark. People passing by the edge of the field, every time they saw that piece of black, oily, and shiny land, showed surprised expressions and said:

　　"Look, Li Shizhang is settling his land!"

　　Li Shizhang is twenty-four years old this year, with thick eyebrows, big eyes, and a medium build. His dark face always wears a kind smile. Because he is honest, capable, and receptive to new things, the masses trust him very much, and he was elected by the villagers as the militia captain and mutual aid group leader. This time, after receiving the iron farm tools, he was the first to change his production method and carry out fixed cultivation, not only turning over the wasteland, removing the tree roots, but also repairing the field edges, building field banks, digging ditches, and setting up fences at the head of the field with branches, tidying up the land until it was smooth and expansive.

　　"How did you learn this method?"

　　"A few days ago, I went to Leishan County to the market," Li Shizhang replied with a chuckle: "Walking to the Danjiang River, I saw several Han farmers planting mountain land like this. At that time, I said: This is too much trouble! They said: 'If you don't plant the land like this, how will the crops grow well!' Yes, the way we used to do it in the past, just scattering seeds without turning the soil, the sparrows were happy, but we had to go hungry!" Then he stuck his hand into the loose soil: "Look, this land is turned over at least six inches deep, not to mention planting millet, it's enough for transplanting rice seedlings!" Immediately, he grabbed a handful of soft soil, crushed it in his fingers, and then threw the soil into the sky: "The looser the soil is dug, the better the crops will grow!"

　　The villagers who didn't believe that there were farmers plowing mountain land, now that they saw Li Shizhang doing it, although some people still shook their heads and said: "This method is good, but it's too much work, we can't do it…" But in fact, they were all convinced. Without the work team going door-to-door to teach them, many families automatically looked at each other and learned the new cultivation method.

　　One morning, Comrade Li Hao from the work team walked through the canyon and jungle, heading towards the mountain. He found that those who had been running around the mountains chopping "fire" not long ago were now cultivating the wasteland in a fixed location, and the place that was originally a wasteland of weeds had now been reclaimed into farmland. In the once-silent high mountain forests, the sounds of herding cattle plowing the land and the sound of stones hitting each other to repair the field banks could be heard everywhere.

　　"How quickly life changes!" He smiled, recalling the scene when he was transferred from the army to the local area in 1950 and assigned to work in the ethnic minority areas by the county party committee. At first, he couldn't understand why the organization would assign a Han cadre to this place, but after more than a year of work, he not only understood the importance of ethnic minority work, but also loved them even more. When he saw them moving towards a new life day by day under the leadership of the Party and the government, he felt sincere joy and pride. "And this is just the beginning! In the future, when agriculture is collectivized and mechanized, this place will become even more prosperous and beautiful." With these thoughts lingering in his mind, he walked past one piece of farmland after another, but upon inspection, he found that although the land had been turned over, none of it had been fertilized!

　　"Manure should be applied, but why doesn't anyone apply manure?"

　　In the evening, when he convened a meeting of village cadres and activists to specifically discuss the issue of fertilization, he didn't expect everyone to suddenly burst into laughter as if they had heard a joke.

　　"Applying manure to mountain land, I've never heard of it…"

　　"Doesn't the crops still grow the same without manure! Why apply manure?"

　　"Applying manure to mountain land is like lighting a lamp for the blind, the people in other villages will laugh at us!"

　　Later, Li Hao used the example of increased rice yields from applying manure in local paddy fields to explain the importance of fertilization, and hoped that everyone would take the lead and encourage the masses to change their habit of not applying fertilizer. Hearing this, a light suddenly flashed in Li Shizhang's mind, and he recalled that one year his piece of land yielded three dou more corn than other lands because he burned wood ash, wasn't that the effect of fertilizer? So he stood up and excitedly told everyone about this matter, and finally he said:

　　"I will send manure to the mountain tomorrow…. During the Kuomintang rule, people didn't even have enough to eat, who would apply fertilizer to the land? But now, we people have turned over, and the land should also turn over."

　　After repeated persuasion and mobilization, the masses finally began to send manure. Men and women, carrying and lifting, working alone and helping each other... The several cadres of the work team also followed everyone to send manure to the fields and sow seeds. In just a few days, more than 300 mu of land were sown. In addition to millet and corn, a lot of flue-cured tobacco was also planted. But what effect would fertilization have? Even after sowing was completed, some elderly people still didn't believe it. But as time went by, the difference between the two types of land became more and more obvious. On the same hillside, the crops that had been fertilized were black and oily, growing strong and lush; the crops that hadn't been fertilized were withered and shriveled, as if they had been frosted.

　　"Look, now you can compare the results." Li Shizhang stood in a green field, pointing to the crops waving in the wind, and said to Li Hao from the work team: "We ethnic minorities are just like this, no matter how good something is, if they don't touch it with their own hands and see it with their own eyes, they won't believe it. By next year, you'll see, there won't be any need to mobilize, everyone will be rushing to apply manure!"

　　As he was saying these words, Comrade Li Hao was bending over in the field pulling weeds – weeds had already spread in the field. The main thing was that it hadn't rained for a long time and the land was dry. He thought: We should mobilize the masses to loosen the soil and weed.

　　"Lao Li, if you want the crops to grow well, you not only have to apply manure, but also weed," he pointed to the weeds mixed in with the crops, and the dry, hard soil under his feet, explaining: "Weeding and loosening the soil can withstand drought, maintain soil moisture, and exert the power of fertilizer. Weeding once more and loosening the soil once more is like applying manure once more and watering once more..., do you think we can do it?"

　　"Weeding? That's much more difficult than applying manure!"

　　"Of course there will be difficulties... But I think this way: as long as our cadres are ideologically aligned, then we will definitely be able to do it." From the previous two experiences, Comrade Li Hao deeply realized the importance of relying on ethnic minority cadres: "This time, we should still start with the cadres as before and set an example for the masses."

　　"Hmm, that's the right thing to do." Li Shizhang listened to every word, smiled thoughtfully, and said: "You believe that we can do it, but I'm still a little worried!"

　　"Now is different from the past, even the masses believe in the benefits of improving production…"

　　At this time, Li Shizhang looked at the white clouds in the sky, his mind churning: Can we do it? Can't we do it? We've never weeded mountain land here, if we don't know how to weed, and we accidentally weed out the crops, won't all the hard work of the year be lost? But when he thought of how every reform of the Communist Party brings greater happiness to the Miao people, he slapped his knee and stood up with a whoosh:

　　"Okay! Let's mobilize for weeding!" In May and June, the fifty-one hardworking Miao families in Triangle Field Village had weeded the mountain land twice and hoeed the rice fields twice. In addition, there was a heavy rain not long ago, and the crops were growing especially fast. In the fields, the large, fleshy tobacco leaves and the heavy rice ears brought hope of a good harvest to the people. Thinking of the upcoming harvest, everyone couldn't help but sing mountain songs:

　　"Golden flowers bloom on the yellow soil slope!
　　It's impossible to dig them up with just hands and feet,
　　We've abandoned the 'wooden cattle frame' that's been around for many years,
　　And replaced it with a brand-new iron plowshare,
　　Chairman Mao in Beijing,
　　You are the great benefactor of the Miao people!"

　　After some time, the autumn harvest began.

　　The ripened rice, like golden brocade, was inlaid on the mountain terraces. Millet, flue-cured tobacco, and tall corn, like neat walls, created many waves when the wind blew. The farmers, waving shiny sickles, were scattered in groups of three or five across the golden mountains and fields.

　　"What good crops!" Li Shizhang said with a smile to mutual aid group member Li Shichun: "It wasn't a waste to weed and apply manure, was it?"

　　"I've long been in favor of this method!"

　　"Hey! Look, this corn stalk has three big corncobs!" Li Maoxian, who was harvesting ahead of others, shouted joyfully, holding up a big corncob in his hand: "In the past, the corn here grew like sparrows, but this year it grows like radishes. The same land, the same weather, but why is it so different?"

　　The harvesting of rice and tobacco was also proceeding smoothly. Some were cutting, some were carrying, some were threshing, and some were repairing tobacco sheds. Men, women, old and young, were all involved in the tense autumn harvest. It looked like it would be finished in a few days, but the weather suddenly changed.

　　One night, Li Shichun was awakened by the sound of thunder. He jumped to the window and saw that dark clouds were covering the southeastern sky as a strong wind blew up, followed by white lightning, and the thunder boomed terribly, shaking the windows. A storm was coming. He immediately ran to the street:

　　"Get up! The rain… is coming! Go up the mountain… to save the crops!"

　　At this time, many families were awakened. Some hadn't even put on their clothes and ran to the street with bare backs. A flurry of frightened voices came from the chaotic crowd: "Oh no, how much of the crops will be ruined!"

　　The mother of military dependent Li Shouneng, holding the threshold, anxiously shouted to the people:

　　"Heavens! I still have more than a dozen loads of rice in the fields! The wind will blow them away…"

　　Hearing this, Li Hao from the work team immediately threw on his clothes and jumped onto the stone embankment, shouting into his hands that he had shaped into a loudspeaker:

　　"Folks! We must first help the military dependents harvest, it is their sons who are defending our happiness! We cannot let the military dependents lose a single stalk of rice or a single grain of millet…"

　　"Let's go!"

　　Men and women carried loads, ropes, sickles, and torches made of pine wood in their hands, and ran together into the dark fields. In the wind and rain and flickering firelight, teams of people saving the crops ran everywhere on the slopes, terraces, and mountain roads, and a heated battle to protect the grain was underway. People quickly recovered all the grain that could have been washed away.

　　After the rain cleared, the squares piled high with grain were filled with the sound of threshing. This year, the entire village generally increased grain production by 13% compared to previous years, and some even reached 35%. Wherever Li Hao went, people surrounded him, happily reporting the good harvest.

　　"The harvest is too good. My two and a half mu of wasteland yielded four hundred jin of flue-cured tobacco and two hundred jin of corn!" Li Shizhang翘着翘着 (unable to translate idiom so kept in CN) his fingers, smiling as he calculated: "Besides that, the paddy fields also yielded thirty-two loads of rice! If I convert the flue-cured tobacco into three thousand jin of millet, I have harvested twenty-five loads of grain more this year than before liberation, which is the first good harvest for my family for generations." Four

　　Two more years have passed. With the change of production methods and the improvement of productivity, the Miao family life in Triangle Field Village has become more prosperous. Li Shizhang, who has forever escaped poverty, now has a horse, a cow, and all kinds of farm tools at home. In the past, he went out barefoot, wearing a raincoat, but now he wears a brand-new blue cotton uniform, and also carries a fountain pen and a flashlight. Besides him, there are many such families in the village. After the general rise in the economy, in three years, the number of cattle in the village increased from fourteen to fifty-five, the number of horses increased from two to twelve, and the number of pigs increased from forty to more than eighty. In 1953 alone, the 220,000 tobacco plants they planted increased their wealth by 44 million yuan. Last winter, eleven families built new houses. When Li Maoxian, a poor peasant who used to live in a tree bark shed, moved into his newly built three-room, three-story wooden building, the whole village celebrated with wine and songs. What they celebrated was not just him, but the happiness of the Miao people, thousands upon thousands of them, living in the big family of the motherland!

    土地“安家”前后
    本报记者　纪希晨
    一
    苗族贫农李世章的几辈都种地，可是他家的山地，像居住在三角田寨的其他苗族农民一样，都是一直没有“家”的。
    在蜿蜒层叠的苗岭山中，当春天到来的时候，在那云雾缭绕的深山野林里，常常可以看到他和三五成群的苗族男女，带着刀子、火柴和种籽，奔到茂密的树林里去，砍着、刨着，放把火把山林烧起。冲腾的烈火随着风势、在山野上空怒吼着，直烧到附近再也没有什么可烧，或下起雨来将火熄灭的时候，人们便在那铺满灰烬的土地上，开始播种了。因为他们缺少耕牛和农具，经过这种“砍火焰”的山地，都不犁、不耙、也不上肥料，只把种籽向地皮上一撒，就等着收获了。这样种过一两年后，看到地没劲了，便将这块“地”丢掉，又转移到别处山坡上，重新烧山、毁林、开一季，种一季，开了新荒，丢掉熟荒，地块一直不固定，年年以“刀耕火种”、“赶山吃饭”的方法耕种着山野的土地。
    一九五一年春天，雷山县人民政府号召苗族农民，改变生产方式，固定耕作土地。李世章听了心中虽然十分欢喜，但却不相信。晚上他躺在“草被”里，嘴里吧?着烟锅，想着：是呀！工作组同志讲的挺在理，“种了一山坡，只收一小锅”，还要引起许多火灾、水灾……，但是不烧山又有什么办法呢？在这深山里到那去买农具？两只空手怎么能挖地？最急人的，是眼看就要播种了，全家几口人还没有一把镢头哩！想到这里，他独自苦恼地说：
      “这是祖祖辈辈世代传下来的，要改变那可不容易！不管怎样，我明天还要烧山去。”
    第二天，东方刚一发红，李世章便带着刀子上山了。他走进一座枝叶完全纠缠成一片的树林里，一面唱着歌，一面“呼呼”地砍伐着。斧声和歌声打破了山林的寂静。正砍着，突然听见远远有人喊：“谁在那砍山呀”，抬起头来一看，原来是工作组李浩同志，李世章连忙丢下斧子，以问代答的说：“你怎么也上山啦啊？”
      “我刚从县上回来。以后不要再满山跑着砍山啦。毛主席为了帮助我们苗家改进生产，现在给送来大批铁制农具了！”李浩同志走过来，拍着肩臂，兴奋地对他说：“昨天我一接到信，就连夜赶到县上去，你看，现在不是把农具领来了吗？”
      “哈呀！这下生产可有办法了。”李世章又惊又喜，立刻跟着李同志飞也似地跑出山林。当他看到十多挑崭新发亮的铁犁、铁铧、铁锄头时，激动得一时不知该说什么，心跳动着，两只手一会摸摸这，一会又摸摸那，恨不得马上用它来翻开脚下的土地。
    村公所的院子里，挤满了看农具的人。裹着黑头巾的老汉，穿着紫色百褶裙的妇女，和年青的姑娘……他们像赶来参加什么庆祝会似的，一个个都喜气洋洋的，那些走不进去的，就站在门口两旁的街道上，三五成群的说笑着。
    李世章快活的挤在人群中，忽而从院里走到街上，忽而又从街上弯回院里，为的是想找人谈谈，分享一下自己的欢喜。
      “看到了吗？自打记得事起，我还是头一次见过这么多哩！”
      “谁不是呀！我问你，怎么共产党、毛主席连这件事都挂在他心上呢？”一个深受感动的老太婆，用袖子沾着湿润的眼睛说：“他老人家可真为我们操心啊！”
      “是呀！咱们什么困难他不关心呢！”李世章扳着手指，一件件数着，生怕别人听不见似的，大声的说：“我们没吃的时候是谁给发来救济粮呢？是共产党、毛主席。没有穿的时候是谁给发来寒衣呢？还是共产党、毛主席。现在共产党、毛主席又给送来农具，真比亲爹娘还照顾得我们周到哩！”
      “那，你以后是不是还要砍山呢？”站在他旁边的李世春，冲着他问。
    “有了农具谁还再那样生产呢？”
    二
    清晨，当朝阳用欢乐的金光，惊醒了睡梦中的大地，人们才刚刚上地的时候，李世章已摸黑翻完了一大片留着春雪残迹的土地。打地边经过的人，每望见那一片黑油油发亮的土地，都露出惊奇的神气说：
    “看，李世章在给地安家哩！”
    李世章今年二十四岁了，浓眉，大眼，中等身材，黑黝黝的脸上总带着和善的微笑。因他为人忠厚，办事精明，容易接受新事物，所以群众对他很信任，他被村人选为民兵队长和互助组长。这次领到铁制农具，他又首先改变生产方式，进行固定耕作，不仅把荒土翻开，树根刨掉，并且修了地边，垒了地畔，挖下了水沟，用树枝在地头上扎起栏栅，把土地修整得光光展展的。
      “你这方法是怎么学会的？”
      “前几天我到雷山县城去赶集，”李世章嘿嘿笑着回答：“走到丹江边上，看到几个汉族农民这样种山地，当时我说：这多麻烦哩！他们说：‘不这样种地，怎么会长好庄稼呢！’是呀，照咱们往年那样，只撒种籽不翻地，麻雀倒欢喜，咱可得饿肚皮！”接着他把手插进松软的泥土里：“你们看，这地翻的足有六寸深，不要说种谷子，就是插稻秧也足够哩！”随即他又抓起一把轻软的泥土，在手指里捏碎，然后把土抛上天空去：“泥土刨的越松，庄稼长的越好呢！”
    村里原来不相信有翻犁山地的农民，现在亲眼看到李世章这么一作，虽然还有人摇着头说：“这办法好倒好，就是太费工，咱可办不到……”可是实际上他们却都信服了，不用工作组挨门去教，许多人家都自动你看我、我看你，学习了新的耕作方法。
    一天上午，工作组李浩同志穿过峡谷、丛林，向山上走去。他发觉不久前还满山跑着砍“火焰”的，现在在荒地上固定耕作了，原来一片荒草的地方，如今开垦成耕地了。一向寂静的高山野林里，现在到处响起赶牛耕地的吆吼声，和整修地畔的石头敲打声了。
    “生活变得多么快啊！”回想到一九五零年刚从部队转业到地方，被县委分配到少数民族地区工作时的情景，他笑了。最初他想不通为什么组织上要把一个汉族干部分配到这地方，可是经过一年多的工作，他不仅懂得了少数民族工作的重要，而且更加热爱他们了，当他看到他们在党和政府领导下，一天天走向新生活时，他感到衷心的欢喜和骄傲。“而这只不过是个开端啊！在将来当农业实行集体化、机械化的时候，这里将会变得更加富裕和美好。”脑海里萦绕着这种思想，他走过一块块耕地，但是一检查，都发现地虽翻了，可是全都没有上肥料！
      “应该上粪，可是为什么都不上粪呀？”
    晚间，当他召开村干部和积极分子会议，专门讨论施肥问题时，想不到大家竟像听见什么笑话似的，突然哈哈大笑起来了。
    “给山地上粪，听都没听过……”
      “不上粪庄稼还不一样的长！为什么要上粪呀？”
      “给山地上粪，好比给瞎子点灯，别村人要笑话我们啦！”
    后来，李浩就用当地稻田上粪增产的例子，说明施肥的重要，并希望大家起带头作用，带动群众改变不施肥的习惯。听到这里，李世章脑子里忽然闪亮了一下，回想起有一年他的一块地因为烧了草木灰，就比别的地多收三斗玉米，那不就是肥料的功效吗？于是他站起来，兴奋地向大家叙述了这件事情，最后他说：
      “我明天就送粪上山去……。国民党统治时候，人都吃不饱，谁还往地里上肥料呀？可是，现在，我们人翻身，地也该翻身了。”
    经过多次说服动员，群众终于开始送粪了。男的女的，担的抬的，单干的，变工互助的……，工作组的几位干部也一同随着大家往地里送粪、撒种，没有几天，三百多亩地全播种上了。除了小米、玉米，还栽了许多烤烟。但是上粪究竟会有什么效果呢？就是在播种完了的时候，一些老年人仍是不相信的。可是随着时间一天天的过去，两种土地之间就愈来愈显现出差别了。同是山坡地，上粪的庄稼黑油油的，长得又壮实又茂密；不上粪的，禾苗枯腌腌的，像霜打过似的。
      “你看，现在可比出高低了。”李世章站在一片绿色的田野里，指着迎风波动的庄稼，向工作组李浩说：“我们少数民族就是这性子，那怕再好的东西，如果他不亲手摸摸，亲眼看看，他是不会相信的。到明年，你看吧，不用动员，谁都要抢着上粪呢！”
    当他说着这些话的时候，李浩同志正弯着腰在地里拔着青草，——杂草已经在地里蔓延起来了。主要的是很久没有下雨，土地干旱了，他想：应该发动群众松土锄草了。
      “老李，要想庄稼长好，不光要上粪，还应该锄草，”他指着混杂在庄稼里的青草，和脚下干硬的泥土，解释说：“锄草松土能耐旱，能保持土地水分，发挥粪土力量，多锄一次草，多松一回土，就等于多上一次粪、浇一次水一样……，你说，我们能办到吗？”
      “锄草？那可比上粪困难多了！”
     “困难当然会有……不过我这样想：只要我们干部思想一通，那就一定能够做到。”李浩同志从前两次的经验里，深切体会到依靠少数民族干部的重要：“这次仍应像以前那样，先从干部开始，给群众做个榜样。”
      “嗯，这样做是对的”。李世章一字一句的听着，沉思的笑了笑：“你相信我们能够做到，可是我还有点担心呢！”
      “现在不同过去了，连群众也相信改进生产的好处了……”
    这时，李世章望着天边的白云，在心里翻腾地想道：能办到吗？办不到吧？我们这里山地向来都不锄草呀，要是不会锄，反把庄稼锄掉，那一年辛苦不全丢了？可是当他想到共产党的每一改革，都是给苗家带来更大的幸福时，他拍着膝盖，呼的站了起来：
      “好吧！咱就动员锄草吧！”三交六月的时候，三角田寨五十一户勤劳的苗家，已把山地锄过两遍草，稻田薅过二道秧了。加以不久前又下了场透雨，庄稼长的特别快。田野里，那宽大肥嫩的烤烟叶，和那沉甸甸的稻穗子，给人们带来丰收的希望，想到即将到来的收获，大家都情不自禁的唱起山歌来：
    “黄土坡上生金花啊！
    单凭手脚无法扒哟，
    丢下那多年的‘木牛架’呵，
    换上崭新的铁犁铧罗，
    北京城啊毛主席，
    你是苗家的大恩人啊！”
    过了一些时候，秋收开始了。
    成熟了的稻子，像一条条金色的锦缎嵌铺在山间梯田上。谷子、烤烟和高大的玉米，好似一堵堵齐整整的墙，风一吹，荡起许多波浪。农民们晃着闪光的镰刀，三三五五地散布在金黄色的山野上。
    “多好的庄稼呀！”李世章笑着，对互助组员李世春说：“没有白白锄草、上粪吧？”
      “我早就赞成这办法呀！”
    “嗨呀！你们看，这棵上结了三个大玉米！”收在别人前面的李茂先，手中高高举起一棵大玉米，欢跳地喊着说：“往年咱们这里玉米长的像麻雀，今年长的都像大萝卜，同样的土地，同样的天气，可是，为什么会这么不同呀？”
    稻子、烤烟的收割也顺利进行着。有的割，有的挑，有的打，有的整修烤烟棚。男女老少全都投入了紧张的秋收。眼看再有几天就完了，可是天忽然变了。
    一天晚上，李世春被雷声惊醒。跳到窗口一看，只见随着刮起的大风，乌云密布了东南方的天空，紧跟着一道道白色的闪电，雷声可怕的爆响着，把窗户震动得直抖。暴雨就要来了。他立刻跑到街上：
    “起来噢！雨……来了！上山……抢庄稼啊！”
    这时许多人家都醒来了，有的衣服还没穿好，就光着脊背跑到街上，乱哄哄的人群里发出一片惊惶的话声：“不得了，这下庄稼该坏多少！”
    军属李守能的母亲，手把着门槛，焦急地向人们喊：
    “天呀！我还有十几挑稻子在田里放着哪！风要刮跑了……”
    听到这话，工作组李浩立即披着衣服跳到石坎上，对着两只手握成的话筒，大叫：
    “老乡们！我们要先帮助军属抢收，是他们的儿子保卫着我们的幸福！不能让军属损失一棵稻、一粒谷……”
      “走啊！”
    男男女女带着担子，绳子、镰刀，手里举着用松木扎的火把，一齐向漆黑的田野里奔跑去。在风雨和闪烁的火光里，坡坎上，梯田里，山道上，到处奔走着抢收的队伍，沸腾地进行着保卫粮食的战斗。人们很快收回了可能被冲的全部谷物。
    雨过天晴后，堆满谷物的广场上，到处一片呯呯啪啪的打谷声。全村这一年粮食普遍比往年增产百分之十三，有的则达百分之三十五。李浩无论走到那里，都有人围住向他快乐地报告着丰收。
      “收成太好了。我的两亩半荒地，收了四百斤烤烟，二百斤玉米！”李世章翘着手指头，微笑地计算着说：“除这，稻田还收了三十二挑稻谷！如果把烤烟折成三千斤谷子，我今年整整比解放前多收二十五挑谷物，是我家祖祖辈辈的第一次丰收。”四
    时间又过了两年。随着生产方式的改变和生产力的提高，三角田寨苗家生活变得更加富裕了。永远摆脱了贫困的李世章，现在家中喂着一匹马、一条牛，农具样样都有。往年他出门赤脚、披蓑衣，如今却穿着崭新的蓝棉制服，还带着水笔、手电筒。除他，全村还有很多这样的人家。在经济普遍上升之后，三年间，全村耕牛由十四头增至五十五头，马由二匹增加到十二匹，猪由四十只增至八十多只。一九五三年单栽种的二十二万株烤烟，就给他们增加了四千四百万元的财富。去年冬天，十一家盖起了新房，原来住在树皮棚子里的贫农李茂先，当他迁入新盖的三间三层高的木楼房时，全村人都持酒唱歌来庆祝。他们庆祝的不只是他，而是千千万万生活在祖国大家庭中的苗家的幸福！
