Guangdong's state-owned Wanzai Shipyard and Shantou Shipyard are actively renovating vessels for fishermen in order to develop fishery production. Since its establishment in January of this year, the state-owned Wanzai Shipyard has renovated a batch of vessels for fishermen. The factory is now installing large shrimp seine boats for fishery production cooperatives. The state-owned Shantou Shipyard is preparing to build a batch of deep-sea fishing vessels before the autumn fishing season this year and lend them to organized fishermen. Deep-sea fishing vessels have higher yields than shallow-sea fishing vessels, and the economic value of the fish caught is also greater. For example, motorized shark fishing boats, which are planned to be lent to fishermen in Pinghai Port, Huiyang, can fish in deep seas of one hundred meters, catching large sharks for food and industrial raw materials.

    广东省湾仔、汕头两船厂
    积极为渔民装修船只
    广东地方国营湾仔造船厂和汕头造船厂，为发展渔业生产，积极为渔民装修船只。地方国营湾仔造船厂自今年一月间成立以来，已替渔民装修了一批船只。现该厂正替渔业生产合作社装大虾罟船。地方国营汕头造船厂准备在今年秋季渔汛前造好一批深海作业渔船，贷给有组织的渔民。深海作业渔船比浅海作业渔船产量高，捕获的鱼经济价值也大。如准备贷给惠阳平海港渔民的机动钓鲨船，可到一百公尺深的深海捕鱼，捕捉可供食用和供作工业原料的大鲨鱼。
