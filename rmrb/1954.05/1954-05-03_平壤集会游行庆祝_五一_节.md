Pyongyang held a rally and parade celebrating May Day
    Twenty thousand laborers in Pyongyang held a rally and parade in the light rain on May Day, warmly celebrating their own festival and receiving the review of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the leaders of the Republic's party and government.
    On May Day, this heroic city, which is being rebuilt, was dressed in festive attire. The newly repaired buildings and the construction frames standing everywhere were adorned with red flags and huge colored banners. At dawn, laborers dressed in bright festive costumes lined up in neat formations from construction sites, newly restored factories, and suburban villages, gathering in the square in front of the City People's Committee Building in the central district of Pyongyang.
    On the wall of the City People's Committee Building were hung the national emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and huge portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Kim Il-sung, Malenkov, Mao Zedong, and leaders of various people's democratic countries. The flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries fluttered on the upper floors.
    Heroes and model workers from the labor front, senior generals and combat heroes of the Korean People's Army, and envoys and embassy staff from various fraternal countries attended the ceremony on the three grandstands on both sides and to the side of the reviewing stand. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units assisting in the reconstruction of Pyongyang, and representatives of Chinese construction workers were also invited to attend.
    At 10:00 a.m., the leaders of the Korean Party, government, and army, led by Marshal Kim Il-sung, ascended the reviewing stand, and the square immediately erupted, with thunderous cheers and applause lasting for a long time. After Jeong Yeon-byeong, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, announced the start of the meeting, the military band played the solemn "Internationale." Vice Premier Kim Il of the Cabinet delivered a speech, extending warm congratulations to all Korean workers, farmers, and intellectuals. Kim Il said: The proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il at the Geneva Conference, which calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the settlement of the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves, reflects the consistent will of the entire Korean people. At this moment, thunderous cheers and applause rang out in the square. Kim Il also called on all the people to advance bravely to successfully complete the Three-Year Plan, to strengthen the democratic base, and to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    After the celebration meeting, 200,000 people began the parade. As the masses passed the reviewing stand, they warmly cheered Marshal Kim Il-sung. At the front of the marching ranks were the Korean working class. They held high portraits of their leaders and charts and models showing the achievements they had made on the restoration and construction front and the targets they were determined to achieve according to the Three-Year Plan. For example, the Pyongyang Textile Factory will increase its production by 60 percent in the fourth quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of this year. The Sanshin Coal Mine in the suburbs of Pyongyang will restore its production this year to 130 percent of its pre-war level in 1949.
    Among the parading ranks were the Chinese construction workers who came to assist the Korean people in restoring construction. They were all wearing neat blue clothes today, and when they passed the reviewing stand, they aroused enthusiastic cheers from the audience.
    Following them were the ranks of farmers, office workers, students, literary and art workers, and citizens. The farmers carried models of plows and various livestock, as well as charts showing agricultural production achievements. A team of farmers dressed in colorful ethnic costumes danced the "Farmers' Dance" as they passed the reviewing stand.
    The students of Kim Il-sung University and Kim Chaek University of Technology carried huge models of books and blast furnaces, expressing their determination to study hard and participate in the construction of the motherland.
    The parading ranks were filled with a victorious confidence in rebuilding the motherland, passing through the thoroughfares of Pyongyang, with thousands of citizens cheering on both sides of the street, and loud shouts of "Long live!" resounded throughout the city.
    The celebration parade ended at about 1:00 p.m. (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang)

    平壤集会游行庆祝“五一”节
    平壤市二十万劳动人民“五一”节在濛濛细雨下举行集会游行，热烈庆祝自己的节日，并接受金日成元帅和共和国党政首长的检阅。
   “五一”这天，这座正在重建中的英雄城披上了节日的盛装，修复了的崭新的大厦，和到处耸立着的建筑架上，都飘扬着红旗，悬挂着巨幅彩色标语。天刚亮，穿着鲜艳的节日服装的劳动人民就排着整齐的队伍，从建筑工地上，从新修复的工厂里，从市郊农村里，向着位于平壤市中心区的市人民委员会大厦前广场集合。
    市人民委员会大厦正面的墙壁上，高悬着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国徽和列宁、斯大林、金日成、马林科夫、毛泽东以及各人民民主国家领袖的巨幅画像。楼上飘扬着朝、苏、中和各人民民主国家的国旗。
    在检阅台两旁和侧面的三个观礼台上参加观礼的有劳动战线上的英雄、模范，朝鲜人民军高级将领及战斗英雄，各兄弟国家驻朝鲜使节和使馆人员。应邀观礼的还有中国人民志愿军代表团、协助重建平壤的中国人民志愿军部队代表和中国建筑工人代表等。
    上午十时，以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜党、政、军首长登上检阅台，广场上立即沸腾起来，雷动的欢呼声和鼓掌声经久不息。平壤市人民委员会委员长郑然彪宣布大会开始后，军乐队奏起庄严的“国际歌”。内阁副首相金一发表演说，他向全朝鲜的工人、农民和知识分子致热烈的祝贺。金一说：南日外务相在日内瓦会议上提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的方案，要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己来解决朝鲜问题，这反映了全朝鲜人民的一贯意志。这时，广场上响起了雷动的欢呼声和鼓掌声。金一又号召全体人民为胜利完成三年计划、为加强民主基地和促进祖国的和平统一而奋勇前进。
    庆祝大会结束后，二十万群众开始游行。群众行列通过检阅台时，向金日成元帅热烈欢呼。游行队伍的最前面走着朝鲜的工人阶级。他们高抬着领袖像和图表、模型，显示他们在恢复建设战线上已经取得的和决心按照三年计划取得的成绩的指标。例如平壤纺织工厂在今年的第四季度将比今年第一季度增产百分之六十。平壤郊区的三神煤矿今年的产量要恢复到战前一九四九年的百分之一百三十。
    游行队伍里有前来协助朝鲜人民恢复建设的中国建筑工人的队伍。他们今天都穿着整齐的蓝色衣服，当他们走过检阅台时，引起全场的热烈欢呼。
    接着通过的是农民、机关工作人员、学生、文艺工作者和市民的行列。农民们抬着耕牛和各种家畜的模型，还有表示农业增产成绩的图表。有一队农民穿着鲜艳的民族服装，跳着“农乐舞”走过检阅台。
    金日成综合大学和金策工业大学学生们的队伍抬着巨大的书本和炼铁炉的模型，表示他们要努力学习参加祖国建设的决心。
    游行队伍洋溢着重建祖国的胜利信心，走过平壤市的通衢大道，成千上万的市民夹道欢呼，宏亮的“万岁”声响彻了全城。
    庆祝游行至下午一时许结束。（新华社平壤讯）
