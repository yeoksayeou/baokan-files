    Longchang County Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Actively Supplies Pig Feed to Farmers
    The suburbs of Longchang County, Sichuan Province, are one of the key pig-producing areas in the county, with more than 80% of farmers raising pigs. In order to help farmers raise more pigs, the Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the county has strengthened the supply of pig feed such as distiller's grains, rice bran, and broken rice since the second half of last year. In order to do a good job in feed supply, the cooperative specifically organized a working group to conduct in-depth investigations in rural areas to understand the farmers' pig-raising situation and their feed needs. The cooperative also organized agricultural production cooperatives that actively requested to increase pig raising to process vermicelli, and used the remaining vermicelli residue as pig feed. This helped the agricultural production cooperatives to raise a large number of pigs. The Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative alone increased its pig raising by sixteen heads, accumulating more than 70,000 catties of fertilizer.
    After the Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Longchang County strengthened the supply of pig feed, the number of pigs raised by farmers has been increasing day by day. The number of pigs raised in Xinwan Village, Loufeng Township, has increased from 105 to 120. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 12,500 pigs in the entire Chengguan District, including more than 1,000 breeding pigs. (Xian Zuhui)

    隆昌县城关区供销合作社
    积极供应农民养猪饲料
    四川省隆昌县城郊是该县毛猪生产重点地区之一，百分之八十以上的农户都喂养毛猪。该县城关区供销合作社为帮助农民多养毛猪，从去年下半年就加强了酒糟、米糠、碎米等喂猪饲料的供应工作。为了作好饲料供应工作，该社曾专门组织工作组，深入农村调查了农民喂养毛猪和需要饲料的情况。该社还组织积极要求增喂毛猪的农业生产合作社加工粉条，将剩下的粉渣等作为喂猪饲料。这样就帮助农业生产合作社增喂了大批毛猪。仅黎明农业生产合作社就增喂十六头毛猪，积肥七万多斤。
    隆昌县城关区供销合作社加强了喂猪饲料的供应工作以后，农民养猪的数量日益增加。楼峰乡新湾村养猪数量已由一百零五头增加到一百二十头。据不完全统计，现在全城关区已有一万二千五百多头猪，其中种猪有一千多头。　（冼祖挥）
