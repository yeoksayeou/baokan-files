Zhu Wenxi's Study Methods
Propaganda Department of the Liaoxi Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Committee of the Communist Party of China

Editor's Note: Zhu Wenxi (Communist Party member), leader of the research group of the Agriculture Department of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, diligently studies political theory and Party policies, and has been selected as a learning model for Liaoxi Province's directly subordinate organs three times. On March 16th of this year, the Propaganda Department of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a circular commending his model learning deeds and called on all cadres in the province to learn from him. Zhu Wenxi's academic achievements show that it is entirely possible for worker and peasant cadres to improve their cultural level and study political theory.

Zhu Wenxi is from Changbei County, Liaoxi Province, and is twenty-four years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family and participated in labor from an early age, working as a short-term laborer for landlords. As a child, he studied intermittently for five and a half years through part-time farming and part-time study. In 1947, Changbei was liberated, and Zhu Wenxi became a clerk for the farmers' association, throwing himself into the vigorous land reform movement. In this acute class struggle, he received profound class education, and his work became more enthusiastic and active.

In order to cultivate this young cadre from a peasant background, the organization sent him to Liaobei College to study in 1949. At the school, he became closer to the Party, constantly receiving Party education, and developed the consciousness to strive for the cause of communism. In the spring of 1950, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. As a Party member, he felt even more deeply the importance of his responsibility. For the sake of the Party's cause, he resolved to study hard and work well.

It was very difficult for someone who had only studied for five and a half years to learn some chemical formulas and agricultural techniques, but the difficulties did not frighten him. Whenever Zhu Wenxi thought of the Party's cause and the Party and the people's ardent expectations of him, he increased his strength to overcome difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of his classmates, and with his own hard work, he finally quickly caught up with the other students and was elected as a learning model at the end of the semester.

After studying for a year, Zhu Wenxi was assigned to work in the Agriculture Department of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government. At the beginning, he was not familiar with the work. He still remembers that once he spent a lot of effort writing a notice to convene a meeting of the Party branch committee, but when the general branch reviewed it, almost all of it was deleted and revised. Similar situations were common at the beginning. Although Zhu Wenxi had studied at school for a year, because of his low cultural level and short working time, his theoretical knowledge and practical struggle experience were still not much, so it was always a bit difficult to study. For example, he wanted to read a newspaper editorial, but sometimes he encountered a few terms that he didn't understand, and it was not easy to persevere.

At that time, the Party organization assigned him to keep Party documents, and Sun Liangcai, the deputy director of the Agriculture Department, often borrowed documents to read. He saw the red and blue marks on the documents that Sun Liangcai returned and greatly admired Sun Liangcai's meticulous and attentive reading. He thought, "Why does Sun Liangcai study so well? There must be a trick." One day, he went to Sun Liangcai with great hope to ask about the trick to studying. However, Sun Liangcai told him, "You can't rely on shortcuts for anything. The size of your achievements is always determined by how hard you work." Later, he introduced to Zhu Wenxi his own experience in gradually developing study habits. Zhu Wenxi was deeply moved, so he resolved to study diligently.

From then on, Zhu Wenxi began to read some short and simple articles, and he insisted on reading every document he picked up to the end. Whenever he encountered difficulties, he would think of Sun Liangcai's words and encourage himself to continue moving forward. If he didn't understand something after reading it once, he would read it twice, and if it still didn't work, he would read it three times. By learning in this way from the shallow to the deep, he slowly realized the benefits of learning, became interested in learning, and developed a habit. Whenever he had free time, he wanted to read books and newspapers. If he didn't study for a day, it was as if he had a major event that he hadn't taken care of. For several years, he had never interrupted his spare-time self-study. He carefully read all kinds of Party documents issued to him, and regularly read "People's Daily," "Northeast Daily," "Liaoxi Daily," "China Youth," "China Agricultural News," and other newspapers and periodicals. After having some foundation, he further used his spare time to study theoretical books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "A Brief Biography of Stalin." This rapidly improved his cultural level, policy and business level. He used to not even be able to write a notice well, but now he is a correspondent for "Northeast Daily" and "Liaoxi Daily." Due to his hard study, he also had a certain foundation in theory. Last year, when the Liaoxi Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs adjusted learning classes, he was already able to participate in the intermediate group's "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." Even when he went to the countryside, he always tried to squeeze out time to study political theory. His spirit of hard study also moved many comrades.

In 1953, the country entered a new period of planned economic construction. The Party Central Committee called on the whole Party to work hard to study the Soviet Union's theory and experience in building socialism to adapt to the needs of China's new period of economic construction. This call was warmly responded to by the vast number of cadres and further improved Zhu Wenxi's enthusiasm for learning. But how to start? Opening "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," he realized that he knew too little. He initially spent a lot of effort studying political terms and so on. But after a few days, he felt that it was not going to work to continue studying in this way. In order to concentrate on studying socialist economic construction issues, he felt that he had to correct this study method and decided to link learning with current tasks. But then the impatient mood of "eagerness for quick success" arose. When he was working in the countryside, he first read Chapter 11 of "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" on the theoretical issues of agricultural collectivization, but because he skipped Chapters 9 and 10, he did not have a deep understanding of the issue of agricultural collectivization, especially the long-term and arduous nature of the transformation of the small-peasant economy and the relationship between agricultural cooperation and socialist industrialization. After the help of the counselor, the Provincial Party Committee's Study Office introduced the key issues of studying Chapter 9 of "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" and explained the significance of studying Chapter 9. Only then did he realize that he had taken a detour, and he made an in-depth study of Chapter 9. From his years of learning, especially in this period of learning, he deeply realized the importance of establishing correct learning viewpoints and mastering correct learning methods. Only by more deeply and meticulously understanding the Party's instructions on the purpose of learning the Soviet socialist economic construction theory, grasping the center firmly, starting from his existing level, and progressing step by step can he learn well.

One of the most prominent characteristics of Zhu Wenxi's study is that, over the years, no matter what he studies, he is always good at using the spirit of the documents to compare and examine himself. If he finds anything wrong with his own thinking or work, he seriously examines and corrects it. He knows that he was born in the old society and inevitably contracted some old viewpoints and old ideas, and that revolutionary theory is a sharp weapon to overcome the influence of these non-working-class ideas. He often says: "The revolution has given us infinite new and wonderful things, but we are afraid of getting used to it and not paying attention. As long as we pay attention, there are things worth learning everywhere. Only by learning more can we better improve our communist moral character."

Because he did not have a clear understanding of the worker-peasant alliance and the relationship between industry and agriculture in the past, when the Party and the state put forward the policy of developing heavy industry first, Zhu Wenxi also developed the idea of neglecting rural work. However, after studying the Soviet socialist economic construction theory, he had a more comprehensive understanding of socialist construction and immediately strictly criticized his past one-sided understanding, completely overcame the idea of wanting to change careers, and became more energetic in his work. After studying Chapter 9 of "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," his understanding of the issue of transforming the small-peasant economy was more profound than in the past, thereby understanding the Party's policy of "actively leading and steadily advancing" the mutual aid and cooperation movement. On this basis, he also realistically examined his past erroneous understanding and some deviations in the implementation of policies. In the study of the general line, he further realized the relationship between developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and improving agricultural productivity, so he compared his past work and examined his one-sided understanding of only focusing on improving agricultural technology and not paying enough attention to the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

Zhu Wenxi not only pays attention to linking his work and thinking in the study of political theory, but also often compares himself with the heroic figures in the book when reading a novel or reading a newsletter. For example, after reading "How the Steel Was Tempered," he often uses the spirit of Paul to encourage himself, and also learns from Paul to check himself every day: "What have I done for the Party today?" Seeing the willpower of the fighting heroes described in the book to overcome difficulties and work hard, and the work style of Ren Guodong, the winner of the National Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal, to work hard and go deep among the masses, he was greatly inspired. He also wrote his心得 as material and gave it to the Party branch as a report on his ideological situation.

Because Zhu Wenxi is able to check and compare his thinking in this way in his study, he is able to gradually and deeply understand the theory and policy learning at the level of understanding that he can achieve, thereby effectively improving his political awareness and level of understanding. Therefore, his policy and ideological level and working ability have improved relatively quickly, and his consciousness and initiative in his work are constantly being strengthened.

    朱文熹是怎样学习的
    中共辽西省直属机关委员会宣传部
    编者按：辽西省人民政府农业厅研究组组长朱文熹（共产党员），刻苦钻研政治理论和党的政策，曾三次被评选为辽西省直属机关学习模范。今年三月十六日，中共辽西省委宣传部曾通报表扬他的学习模范事迹，并号召全省干部向他学习。朱文熹的学习成绩，说明了工农干部提高文化和学习政治理论是完全可能的。
    朱文熹是辽西省昌北县人，今年二十四岁。他出生在一个贫农的家庭里，从小就参加劳动，给地主做过短工。小时候，靠着半耕半读，断断续续地念过五年半书。一九四七年，昌北解放了，朱文熹做了农会的文书，投入了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动。在这次尖锐的阶级斗争中他受到了深刻的阶级教育，工作更加热情积极了。
    为了培养这个年青的农民出身的干部，组织上在一九四九年把他送到辽北学院去学习。在学校里他更加靠近了党，不断地接受党的教育，有了为共产主义事业奋斗的觉悟，于一九五○年春，光荣地参加了中国共产党。做了党员，他就更加感到自己责任的重大，为了党的事业，下定决心努力学习，好好工作。
    一个只念过五年半书的人，要学习一些化学公式和农业技术是很困难的，可是困难并没有吓倒他。朱文熹一想到党的事业，一想到党和人民对他的殷切希望，就增加了克服困难的力量。在党的领导和同学们的帮助下，再加上他自己的苦学，终于很快地赶上了其他的同学，在学期终结时，他当选为学习模范。
    学习一年后，朱文熹被分配到辽西省人民政府农业厅工作。开始时，业务不熟。他还记得：有一次费了很大力气写了一个召集党支部委员开会的通知，结果总支审阅时几乎全都给删改了。类似的情况开始时是很多的。朱文熹虽然到学校学习了一年，可是由于原来文化水平低，参加工作时间短，理论知识和实际斗争经验都还不多，因而学习起来总有些吃力。比如他想读一读报纸社论，可是有时碰到几个名词自己不懂，就不易坚持下去。
    当时党组织分配他保管党内文件，农业厅副厅长孙良才常去借阅文件。他看孙良才还回来的文件上有划的红蓝标志，就非常羡慕孙良才读的精细用心。他想：“孙良才为什么学习这么好呢？一定有窍门。”一天，他抱着很大的希望到孙良才那里去请教学习的窍门。可是，孙良才却告诉他：“什么事情都不能依靠投机取巧，成就的大小总是由努力的情况决定的。”以后又把自己怎样逐步养成学习习惯的经验，向朱文熹作了介绍。朱文熹深受感动，于是下决心刻苦地学习。
    从此以后，朱文熹便开始阅读一些简短浅近的文章，凡是拿起的文件一定坚持读到底，每当遇到困难的时候，就想起孙良才的话，鞭策自己继续前进。读一遍不明白，就读两遍，两遍还不行就读三遍。这样由浅入深地学下去，慢慢地就体会到学习的益处，对学习发生了兴趣，养成了习惯。一有空闲，他就想看看书报，一天不学习，就像有件大事还没办似的。几年来，他一直没间断过业余自修，发给他的各种党的文件都精细地阅读，并且按期读了“人民日报”、“东北日报”、“辽西日报”、“中国青年”、“中国农报”等报刊，有了一些基础之后，他进而利用业余时间自修了“毛泽东选集”、“斯大林传略”等理论书籍。这就使他的文化水平、政策业务水平都迅速的提高，他过去连一个通知都写不好，可是现在他已经是“东北日报”、“辽西日报”的通讯员了。由于刻苦学习，他在理论方面也有了一定的基础，去年辽西省直属机关调整学习班级时，他已经可以参加中级组的“联共（布）党史”学习了。就是下乡的时候，他也总是想法挤出时间来学习政治理论。他的刻苦学习精神也感动了很多同志。
    一九五三年国家进入了有计划的经济建设的新时期，党中央号召全党努力学习苏联建设社会主义的理论和经验，以适应我国经济建设新时期的需要。这一号召得到了广大干部的热烈响应，也进一步提高了朱文熹的学习热情。可是怎样学起呢？翻开“联共（布）党史”一看，发现自己知道的太少。他一开始费了很大的力气去研究政治名词等等。可是过了些天，他就觉得这样学下去不行。为了集中力量学习社会主义经济建设问题，他觉得必须纠正这种学习方法，决定把学习与当前任务联系起来。但是又产生了“急于求成”的急躁情绪。他在乡下工作时先读了“联共（布）党史”第十一章有关农业集体化理论问题，但由于越过了九章、十章，对农业集体化问题体会不深，特别是对于小农经济改造的长期性、艰巨性以及农业合作化与社会主义工业化的关系认识不足。后经辅导员的帮助，省委学习室又介绍了学习“联共（布）党史”九章的重点问题，并讲了学习九章的意义，他才发现自己走了弯路，他对九章又作了深入钻研。他从几年来的学习中，特别是这段学习过程中，深刻地体会到树立正确学习观点和掌握正确学习方法的重要，只有更深入更细致地体会党指示的学习苏联社会主义经济建设理论的目的，紧紧抓住中心，从自己现有水平出发，循序前进才能学好。
    朱文熹在学习中一个最突出的特点，就是几年来无论学什么，他总是善于用文件的精神来对照和检查自己，如果发现自己的思想、工作有什么不对头的地方，就认真进行检查和改正。他知道，自己出身于旧社会，不可避免地沾染了一些旧观点旧思想，而革命理论正是克服这些非工人阶级思想影响的锐利武器。他常说：“革命给了我们无限新的美好的东西，可就怕习以为常不去注意，只要注意了，就处处都有值得学习的东西，只有多学习，才能更好的提高自己的共产主义道德品质。”
    由于过去对工农联盟、对工业与农业的关系认识不够清楚，当党和国家提出了首先发展重工业的方针后，朱文熹也产生了忽视农村工作的思想。可是后来学习了苏联社会主义经济建设理论，对社会主义建设事业有了较全面的理解之后，马上对自己过去的片面认识进行了严格批判，彻底克服了想改行的思想，工作劲头更足了。经过“联共（布）党史”第九章的学习，他对小农经济改造问题的认识比过去深刻了，从而理解了党对互助合作运动“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针。在这个基础上他又实事求是地检查了过去的错误认识和执行政策中的一些偏差。在总路线学习中，他又进一步认识了发展互助合作运动与提高农业生产力的关系，于是又对照自己过去的工作，检查了只从提高农业技术着眼，对互助合作运动注意不够的片面认识。
    朱文熹不仅在政治理论学习中能够注意联系自己的工作和思想，就是平常读一本小说，看一篇通讯，也能经常以书中的英雄人物来对照自己，如看了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”一书后，他就经常以保尔的精神来鼓舞自己，并且也学习保尔那样，每天检查自己：“今天为党又做了些什么事情呢？”看到了书中描写的战斗英雄们克服困难、艰苦卓绝的意志，爱国丰产金星奖章获得者任国栋努力工作和深入群众的工作作风，都使他得到了很大启示。他并且把自己的心得写成材料交给党支部，作为思想情况的汇报。
    由于朱文熹在学习中能够经常这样检查和对照自己的思想，就使他在理论政策的学习中，能够在自己所能达到的认识水平上，逐步深入地去领会，这样就切实地提高了自己的政治觉悟和认识水平，因而他的政策思想水平和工作能力都提高得较快，工作的自觉性和主动性也不断在加强。
