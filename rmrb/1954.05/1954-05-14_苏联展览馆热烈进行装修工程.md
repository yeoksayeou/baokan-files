The construction of the grand and magnificent Soviet Exhibition Hall is now vigorously underway.

The total building volume of the Soviet Exhibition Hall is approximately 313,000 cubic meters, including the central hall, industrial hall, agricultural hall, cultural hall, cinema, restaurant, open-air theater, and entrance hall. Except for the open-air theater, the structural work of the entire exhibition hall has been completed, and the plastering and decoration work is now beginning. On the seventh floor of the central hall, formwork is being made and cement is being poured; some areas have already begun to be plastered. Inside the Industrial Hall, more than 4,900 cubic meters of earth filling has been completed, turning it into a flat grand square. Workers are beginning to lay artificial marble floors in the corridors on both sides. The plastering work inside the Cultural Hall has been completed, and terrazzo flooring has begun in the lounge in front of the Cultural Hall. Workers constructing the Agricultural Hall, Cinema, and Restaurant are plastering the interior walls. The 2,100+ cubic meter concrete foundation of the open-air theater has been completed, and bricklaying began yesterday (the 13th).

The external decoration of the exhibition hall has been fully launched. In front of the central hall are the large arches symbolizing the sixteen Soviet republics, forming a semicircle; in contrast to this is a semicircle of various flowers and trees, forming a large circle. In the middle is a large fountain with a diameter of 44 meters. Now, many trucks, bulldozers, and road rollers are busy filling the earth, and some workers are laying the foundations for the large arches. Some workers are digging pits and planting trees according to the blueprints.

In order to decorate the exhibition hall very beautifully, the exhibition hall construction area has specially hired some plaster carving and floral decoration workers from Shanghai, Bengbu and other places. They all consider it a great honor to participate in this great building that symbolizes the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and they are determined to contribute all their skills to this project. They have already begun to copy, make molds, and cast various plaster floral ornaments. Carpenters are carving hardwood floors, flower fence posts, and inverted mullions.

After the completion of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, it can accommodate 80,000 visitors. Our great friend, the Soviet Union, will hold an exhibition here on its great achievements in economic and cultural construction. This will greatly help our people further understand the great achievements of Soviet socialist construction and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. (Photo attached)

    苏联展览馆热烈进行装修工程
    规模宏大、壮丽雄伟的苏联展览馆工程，现正热烈进行中。
    苏联展览馆全部建筑体积共约三十一万三千多立方公尺，内有中央大厅、工业馆、农业馆、文化馆、电影馆、餐厅、露天剧场、门厅等。现在整个展览馆工程除露天剧场外，已全部完成了结构工程，目前正开始粉刷、装修工程。中央大厅第七层正在制模板，浇灌水泥；有的已开始粉刷了。工业馆内部完成了四千九百多立方公尺的填土工程，已变成一个平坦的大广场。工人们正在两旁走廊里，开始铺饰人造大理石地板。文化馆内部的粉刷工程已经完工了，文化馆前边的休息厅已开始做水磨石地板。修建农业馆、电影馆、餐厅的工人，正在粉刷内部的墙壁。露天剧场二千一百多立方公尺的混凝土基础工程已经完工，昨日（十三日）就开始进行砌砖工程了。
    展览馆外部装修工程已全部展开了。在中央大厅前面是标志苏维埃十六个加盟共和国的大拱门，形成半圆形；和这相对称的是用各种花、树围成的一个半圆形，构成一个大圆圈。中间有一座直径达四十四公尺的大喷池。现在，多少部大卡车、推土机、压路机在忙碌着填土，有的工人在打大拱门的地基。有的工人按照图纸在那里挖坑、种树。
    为了把展览馆装饰得非常美丽，展览馆工区特别从上海、蚌埠等地聘来一些石膏雕刻、花饰工人。他们都以能参加这个标志中苏两大国人民团结的伟大的建筑物为莫大光荣，他们决心把自己的技巧全部贡献给这个工程。他们已经开始翻样、制模、浇注各种各样的石膏花饰。木工们正在雕刻硬木地板、花木栏、倒挂楣等花饰。
    苏联展览馆工程完工后，可容纳八万人参观。我们伟大的朋友——苏联，将在这里举办关于在经济和文化建设上的伟大成就的展览会。这对我国人民进一步了解苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就，学习苏联的先进经验，将会有很大的帮助。（附图片）
