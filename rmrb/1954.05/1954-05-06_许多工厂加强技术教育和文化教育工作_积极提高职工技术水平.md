    [This newspaper dispatch] In order to increase production and support national construction, industrial enterprises in various regions are adopting various methods to improve the technical level of workers.
    State-owned, locally state-owned, and private factories and enterprises in Shenyang have universally established spare-time schools for workers. More than 79,000 workers are currently participating in learning. After a period of study and mastering literacy, many workers have created conditions for further technical learning. Li Chunzhong, a worker at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, was originally illiterate. After learning to read, he was able to understand the blueprints that he had not been able to understand for many years. As a result, he and the workers in the workshop worked together to create a giant hydraulic top feeder, reducing the problem of raw material eccentricity and increasing work efficiency by more than six times.
    Various state-owned factories in Lüda attach importance to conducting technical education for workers and training a large number of skilled workers and cadres. For example, at the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory, more than 1,100 technicians and apprentices were promoted in the past year. More than 150 cadres, including assistant engineers, technicians, technical staff, workshop directors, foremen, and section chiefs, were trained from among the workers. More than 790 skilled workers and more than 30 cadres were transferred to support national construction. In order to further meet the needs of production and construction, many factories have strengthened the planning of technical education. According to the characteristics of production, the Dalian Crane Factory decided this year to open technical training classes to effectively conduct systematic technical education for mechanical and riveting workers.
    The Tianjin factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau organize workers to learn technology through methods such as rotation training. This year, the bureau and its Tianjin factories have successively transferred more than 200 workers to the newly built textile factory in Shijiazhuang. It is estimated that the factories can send more than 2,000 people this year to support newly built textile factories in various regions.
    Shanghai factories are actively carrying out the work of training cadres and skilled workers. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant has opened four spare-time technical training classes in the first quarter of this year, which have already played a role in production. For example, the students in the smelting technology class learned advanced Soviet experience and changed the furnace top to a lattice shape, increasing corrosion resistance and extending the life of the open hearth furnace top, increasing production from about 190 furnaces to more than 240 furnaces. The Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machine Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, is training a group of skilled workers for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and the training plan has been completed ahead of schedule.
    The Southwest Iron and Steel Company actively carries out technical education. Last year, the company trained a total of 3,880 technical cadres and skilled workers. This year, it decided to closely integrate technical education with production, widely carry out technical and professional learning for on-the-job workers, and further strengthen organizational institutions to ensure that technical education is carried out in a planned and orderly manner.
    Since the second quarter of last year, Wuhan No. 1 Yarn Factory has opened a factory-wide spare-time technical training class. This year, it plans to establish a special organizational institution to train and train workers, organize spare-time technical training classes into professional training classes, and run rotation training classes for administrators and group leaders to help grassroots cadres promoted from workers improve their professional and cultural levels.

    许多工厂加强技术教育和文化教育工作
    积极提高职工技术水平
    【本报讯】各地工业企业为提高生产、支援国家建设，正采取各种办法提高职工技术水平。
    沈阳市国营、地方国营及私营工厂企业普遍建立了职工业余学校，现在已有七万九千多名职工参加学习。许多工人经过一个时期的学习掌握了文化以后，为进一步学习技术创造了条件。沈阳第二机床厂工人李春仲原来是文盲，学了文化之后，多少年摆在面前看不懂的图纸已能看明白了，于是他和车间工人共同钻研，创造了巨型水压顶料机，减少了原料偏心的毛病，提高工作效率六倍多。
    旅大各国营工厂重视对职工进行技术教育，培养出大批的技术工人和干部。如大连工矿车辆厂在去年一年中，全厂技工、徒工升级的达一千一百多人，从职工中培养出助理工程师、技师、技术员、车间主任、工长、科长等干部一百五十多人，并调出七百九十多名技术工人和三十多名干部，支援国家建设。为进一步满足生产和建设的需要，不少工厂加强了技术教育的计划性。大连起重机器厂今年根据生产的特点，决定开设技术训练班，有效地对机械和铆焊工人进行系统的技术教育。
    华北纺织管理局所属天津各厂以轮训等方式，组织职工学习技术。今年该局及所属天津各厂，已陆续向石家庄新建纺织厂输送职工二百多人。预计今年各厂可派出两千多人支援各地新建纺织厂。
    上海各工厂培养干部和技术工人的工作正在积极进行中。上海钢铁公司第一厂在今年第一季度先后开办了四个业余技术学习班，已在生产上起了作用。如冶炼技术班学员学了苏联先进经验，把炉顶改为格子形，增加抗蚀强度，使平炉顶寿命延长了，从冶炼一百九十炉左右提高到二百四十多炉，增加了生产。公私合营上海新中动力机厂正为第一汽车制造厂培养一批技术工人，训练计划已提前完成。
    西南钢铁公司积极开展技术教育工作，去年全公司共培养了三千八百八十多名技术干部和技术工人，今年决定把技术教育和生产紧密结合，广泛开展在职职工的技术业务学习，并将进一步加强组织机构，使技术教育工作有计划有秩序地进行。
    武汉第一纱厂从去年第二季度起开办了全厂性的业余技术训练班，今年又准备成立一个培养和训练工人的专门组织机构，把业余技术训练班组成专业训练班，开办管理员和小组长轮训班，帮助从工人中提拔出来的基层干部提高业务和文化水平。
