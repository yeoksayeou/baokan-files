Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: According to Vietnam News Agency reports: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army cabled the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces in Indochina on May 22nd, responding to the counter-proposal made by the French Forces Headquarters on May 17th regarding the release of wounded and captured French soldiers from Dien Bien Phu (this response was also delivered by Colonel Gao Wenqing, representative of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, to Professor Huer, representative of the French Forces Headquarters, on the 23rd). The telegram is as follows:

(1) The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army expresses strong protest against the French Expeditionary Forces Headquarters' act of undermining the preliminary agreement proposed by its own delegation and signed by General Cogny on behalf of General Navarre regarding the evacuation of wounded French soldiers from Dien Bien Phu.

French aircraft recently not only bombed Highway 41 between Xungiao and Shanluo, but also bombed Xinlan on May 18th, which is within the area of the current temporary camp for wounded and captured French soldiers of the French Expeditionary Forces in Dien Bien Phu. This proves that the French forces authorities in Indochina have no consideration for the fate of their wounded soldiers at all and do not abide by their own signatures. It is clear that the purpose of this approach by the French Forces Headquarters is merely to sabotage and delay the evacuation of the wounded soldiers, in order to distort the humanitarian policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and create a tense atmosphere at the Geneva Conference.

(2) The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army hereby reiterates that this is a matter of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam deciding to unilaterally release wounded and captured French soldiers of the French Expeditionary Forces from Dien Bien Phu, based on its humanitarian policy towards the wounded and prisoners of war, and not a matter of exchanging wounded soldiers or prisoners of war by both sides, as propagated by the French Forces Headquarters. Therefore, there is no question of establishing a so-called mixed committee to inspect the wounded soldiers in Dien Bien Phu.

The French Forces Headquarters' suggestion to establish a mixed committee to control Highway 41 is also unacceptable. Highway 41 is entirely within the liberated area of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and no foreign political or military authority can raise the issue of controlling this transportation line.

We also do not need French aircraft to evacuate our wounded soldiers, because we can complete this task with our own strength.

Therefore, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army rejects the above-mentioned proposal of the French Expeditionary Forces Headquarters.

(3) Despite the French Forces Headquarters' violation of the agreement, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, in line with the humanitarian policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards the wounded and prisoners of war, and in accordance with the agreement signed by both sides, has decided:

(A) To continue to allow the French forces to evacuate wounded and captured soldiers from Dien Bien Phu. Following the first two batches evacuating 753 wounded and captured soldiers, the third batch (i.e., the final batch) of 105 wounded and captured soldiers will also be evacuated; therefore, the total number of wounded and captured soldiers evacuated will reach 858.

According to preliminary information, these 858 wounded and captured soldiers include soldiers of 21 nationalities, including French, German, Italian, Moroccan, Algerian, Vietnamese from the Vietnamese puppet army, Senegalese, Arab, Swedish, Dutch, Belgian, Spanish, Portuguese, Sudanese, etc.

(B) To expedite the work of the French forces in evacuating wounded and captured soldiers by having the Vietnam People's Army repair the airport to allow Dakota transport planes used for rescue purposes to land. At the same time, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army continues to permit helicopters and other single-engine aircraft to evacuate the aforementioned wounded and captured soldiers. Because the problem of clearing the mines previously buried around the airport by the French Expeditionary Forces has not yet been resolved, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army requests the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces to send technical personnel to participate in the work of clearing the mines and inspecting the safety of the airport in order to ensure the safety of the landing aircraft.

(4) It is requested that the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Forces cease all aerial activities within a ten-kilometer radius around Dien Bien Phu during the evacuation of wounded and captured soldiers, except for the flight of rescue aircraft.

(5) The manner in which this telegram will be implemented will be decided by the representatives of both sides in Dien Bien Phu.

    越南人民军总司令部致电印度支那法军总部
    斥法军总部就释放法军伤俘所提的反建议
    并信守已签订的协议允许法军继续自奠边府撤运伤俘
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部五月二十二日致电印度支那法国远征军总司令部，答复法军总司令部五月十七日就释放奠边府法军伤俘问题所提出的反建议（这个答复并由越南人民军总司令部代表高文庆上校于二十三日递交给法军总司令部代表胡尔教授）。电文如下：
    （一）越南人民军总司令部对于法国远征军总司令部破坏它自己的代表团所建议并由戈涅将军代表纳瓦尔将军签署的关于撤运奠边府法军伤员的初步协议的行为，表示强硬的抗议。
    法国飞机最近不仅轰炸巡教与山萝之间的第四十一号公路，而且还在五月十八日轰炸了新兰，亦即奠边府法国远征军伤俘目前的临时营地的区域之内。这证明：印度支那法军当局根本没有考虑它的伤员的命运，而且不信守它自己的签字。很明显，法军总司令部这种做法，目的只是为了破坏和延缓伤员的撤运，以便歪曲越南民主共和国政府的人道政策，并在日内瓦会议上造成紧张气氛。
    （二）越南人民军总司令部特再次声明，这是一个越南民主共和国政府本着其对待伤员和战俘的人道政策而决定由一方释放奠边府法国远征军伤俘的问题，而不是像法军总司令部所宣传的什么双方交换伤员或战俘。因此，设立所谓混合委员会以检查奠边府伤员的问题是谈不上的。
    法军总司令部建议成立混合委员会来控制第四十一号公路，也是不能被接受的。第四十一号公路完全在越南民主共和国的解放区内，任何外国的政治或军事当局都不能提出控制这条交通线的问题。
    我们也不需要法国飞机撤运我们的伤员，因为我们能靠我们自己的力量完成这项工作。
    因此，越南人民军总司令部拒绝法国远征军总司令部的上述建议。
    （三）尽管法军总司令部违反协议，越南人民军总司令部本着越南民主共和国政府对伤员和战俘的人道政策，并信守双方所签署的协议，特决定：
    （甲）继续允许法军自奠边府撤运伤俘。继头两批将撤运七百五十三名伤俘之后，第三批（即最后一批）伤俘一百零五名亦将撤运；因此，被撤运的伤俘总数将达八百五十八名。
    据初步消息，这八百五十八名伤俘中包括二十一个国籍的士兵，其中有法国人、德国人、意大利人、摩洛哥人、阿尔及利亚人、越南伪军中的越南人、塞内加尔人、阿拉伯人、瑞典人、荷兰人、比利时人、西班牙人、葡萄牙人、苏丹人等。
    （乙）由越南人民军修复机场而让作救护用的达科他式运输机降落，以使法军撤运伤俘的工作加速进行。同时，越南人民军总司令部继续准许直升飞机和其他单引擎的飞机撤运上述伤俘。因扫除法国远征军以前在机场周围所埋的地雷的问题尚未解决，越南人民军总司令部要求法国远征军总司令部派遣技术人员参加扫除地雷与检查机场安全的情况的工作，以便保证着陆飞机的安全。
    （四）要求法国远征军总司令部在撤运伤俘期间，除救护机的飞行之外，停止对奠边府周围十公里范围以内的一切空中活动。
    （五）关于此电文执行的方式问题，将由双方代表在奠边府决定。
            越南人民军总司令部
                  一九五四年五月二十二日
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社二十三日讯：五月二十一日，由于天气恶劣，法国飞机只能自奠边府运走十七名法国远征军的伤俘。二十二日，法国飞机继续撤运了一百一十五名伤俘。至此，越南人民军总司令部在奠边府释放的法军伤俘已共有二百九十一名。
