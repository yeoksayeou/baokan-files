A Real Man
    Remembering Sun Zhongguo, a member of the Volunteer Army's "May 1st" National Day Observation Delegation and a Special Class Meritorious Air Force Pilot

    I.
    Sun Zhongguo regained consciousness from his coma. He found himself lying in a gully, his parachute scattered beside him, surrounded by silence.
      "What happened?"
    He recalled the battle just now. At dawn, he and his wingman chased after enemy planes desperately fleeing towards the sea. Just as he pressed the cannon button and sent an enemy plane crashing into the sea in a burst of black smoke, the situation suddenly changed. Four enemy planes pounced on him from behind. He deftly made a right-side ascent, seized the high ground, and the enemy planes missed their mark, rushing under his plane with a whoosh. Then, four more enemy planes rushed at his back from afar. He was surrounded and lost contact with his wingman.
    The enemy planes were getting closer and closer. While continuing to fly straight, confusing the enemy, he was thinking about how to subdue the enemy and escape the danger. Closer, even closer, it looked like the enemy's lead plane was about to press the cannon button. In the nick of time, at that critical moment, he suddenly stomped on the rudder and pulled the stick, the plane sharply turned and ascended to the upper right. The attacking enemy plane couldn't control itself and rushed ahead of him. At this moment, he could no longer suppress the anger in his heart, slightly tilted his wings, and fired fiercely at the enemy plane. The enemy plane was hit. At the same time, his own plane shuddered violently, lost its balance, and plunged towards the ground. He immediately jumped out of the cockpit, pulled the parachute, and then lost consciousness.
      Thinking of this, a strong thought flashed in his mind: "I have to go back quickly!" He wanted to jump up, but his whole body seemed to be tied with ropes, unable to move.
      "My legs?..." A feeling of terror ran through his entire body. He struggled to raise his head and saw that his right leg was broken, twisted to one side, and the ground was covered in blood.
      "I still have legs!" he muttered to himself in extreme joy. But the excruciating pain and fatigue made him pass out again.

    II.  Waking up in the middle of the night, Sun Zhongguo found himself lying in a hospital bed in the dressing station. He felt feverish all over, and his leg was in severe pain. He gently touched his injured leg with his hand. He felt a bone protruding above the knee, and then he felt another bone protruding on the calf. After a doctor's diagnosis, his right leg was broken into three pieces.
    "Broken into three pieces, can I still fly?" He thought about it every day in distress.
    Soon, he was transferred to a rear hospital. He asked the doctor the same question: "Broken into three pieces, can I still fly?" To his surprise, a doctor earnestly told him:
    "Young man, don't worry! We will definitely be able to cure you. We are preparing to perform 'traction' on it, which is a complicated operation, but it is very painful."
    "Doctor, it doesn't matter!" Sun Zhongguo said excitedly as if he had escaped from desperation: "It doesn't matter, do whatever it takes to cure it! I am not afraid of pain."
    At this time, two Soviet novels, "A Real Man" and "How the Steel Was Tempered," were sent to him from the unit, along with one hundred and eighty letters of sympathy. He greedily read these books and letters. The Party and comrades' warm concern for him, the heroic images of Meresyev and Pavel, were so touching and inspiring. From then on, such chapters constantly appeared in his diary:
    "X month X day: My leg hurt badly again in the middle of last night. The comrades in the ward were all asleep. I held the edge of the bed tightly with my hands and bit my teeth to avoid groaning. The comrade sleeping next to me quickly got up and said to me: 'Shout it out! Don't break your teeth!' But how could I shout? Why should I add my pain to others - my comrades? This is a blood debt, and this debt must be recorded on the heads of the American devils... I want to fly up again and strike the enemy even harder! I want to fly up! Fly up!..."
    "X month X day: Today I read Ostrovsky's speeches, essays, and collections of letters. The ward is very quiet. I feel that Pavel is sitting beside me, telling me these words... I will never think that I am disabled. As long as the blood is flowing and the pulse is beating, I will never stop fighting!..."
    "...Never relax in training and improving myself, and return to the unit!"
    Nine months passed. The day Sun Zhongguo had been looking forward to day and night finally arrived. The plaster cast on his right leg was removed. He could no longer suppress the desire hidden in his heart day and night: "How wonderful it would be to get out of bed, even if it's just to stand for a while." As soon as the doctor who removed the plaster cast left the ward, he quietly got up. First, he put his left leg on the ground, then slowly put his right leg on the ground, and then tried to stand up. Before he could stand firmly, he felt his legs trembling, and his body swayed, almost falling. He quickly grabbed the edge of the bed. After a pause, he endured the pain and gently moved forward one step, and then stopped again. Then, he continued to move forward one step. Although every step made his heart beat fiercely and his body sweat, he continued until he was completely unable to support himself, then he lay down on the bed to rest for a while. After a while, he struggled to get up and practice again. When moving his feet, it was like a child's posture when first learning to walk, and also revealed the joy of a child taking his first step.
    Afterwards, Sun Zhongguo walked with crutches in the corridors and aisles every day, practicing walking. Gradually, he went from the corridor to the courtyard, from the courtyard to the playground, and even practiced on the parallel bars. However, due to the long-term fixation of the plaster cast, the stiff leg could not be bent. How can he make it bend?
    Once, Sun Zhongguo was walking in the playground when he saw some comrades riding bicycles. The bicycles were running very fast, and the riders' legs were stretching and bending. Watching, watching, Sun Zhongguo seemed to get some inspiration, and immediately ran over to practice riding a bicycle.
    He laboriously straightened his right leg, turned over, and gently put it down, slowly touching the pedal of the bicycle with his foot. However, because he could only use his left leg, he lost his balance as soon as he stepped on the bicycle and fell down. Ride up, fall down, fall down, and then ride up again. He practiced like this again and again, and he finally learned to ride a bicycle, and his legs could bend again.
    One day, Sun Zhongguo was riding a bicycle on the playground when a nurse ran over and shouted happily: "Comrade Sun, the comrades from the physical examination committee are here! This is a good opportunity, go and get checked!" He ran to the examination room in one breath. A doctor looked at his medical record and asked: "How is your leg?" "Very good!" he replied forcefully. "Very good? Move it and let me see, can it bend?" The doctor looked at his leg and said. He kicked his leg back and forth twice, then squatted down and stood up again. The doctor said thoughtfully: "Hmm, it doesn't seem very flexible." "Not very flexible?" He retorted unconvinced, then pulled up his pants and jumped up, first with both legs, and then only with his right leg. His sudden movement stunned everyone in the room. He suddenly stopped and walked up to the doctor and asked: "Where is it not flexible? Where is it not flexible?"
    The doctor laughed happily, nodded repeatedly and said: "Flexible, flexible, completely flexible!" He picked up the stamp, dipped it in the inkpad twice, and with a "dang" sound, four bright red characters: "Qualified for Flight" were stamped on the examination form.
    III.
    Early in the morning, at an airfield in North Korea, pilots were busy preparing for takeoff. The weather was so clear, there was no movement of dust, and the sky was as blue as velvet. When the red signal rose into the air, with the roar of the engine, Sun Zhongguo and his comrades' "Silver Swallows" flew into the sky. He couldn't control his excitement. He looked out from the plane: below were the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea that they were protecting, the brave and hardworking Korean people; ahead, was the place where American air pirates might break in, the vast sky that needed him to guard; and behind, on the other side of the Yalu River, was the great motherland that had nurtured and raised him, and the people of the motherland who supported and encouraged him. Thinking of all this, he felt filled with a new life-like power! The hospital life that had just ended seemed to have passed a long time ago, and the scene of participating in the battle more than a year ago seemed like it happened yesterday. He couldn't describe his excited mood, because the wish of more than a year: "I want to fly up again and strike the enemy even harder!" has been realized today! (Attached pictures)

    真正的人
    记志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团团员、空军特等功臣孙忠国
                                冯月华　张玉林　夏林
    一
    孙忠国从昏迷状态中苏醒了。他发现自己躺在一个山沟里，降落伞散乱地铺在他的身旁，四周是一片寂静。
      “这是怎么回事呀？”
    他回想起刚才的一场战斗。拂晓，他和他的僚机向拼命逃往海上的敌机追去。当他按动炮钮，把一架敌机打得冒着黑烟栽到海里去了的时候，情况突然发生了变化，四架敌机向他背后扑来，他敏捷地作了右侧上升，抢占了高度，敌机扑了个空，刷地一下从他的飞机底下滑过去了，接着，远远又有四架敌机向他的背后冲来，他陷入包围了，和僚机也失掉了联系。
    敌机越来越近了，他一面继续平飞，迷惑敌人，一面在想着如何制伏敌人，脱离险境。近了，更近了，眼看敌人的长机就要按炮钮了。说时迟，那时快，就在这个节骨眼上，他猛然蹬舵拉杆，飞机向右上方急转直升，攻击他的敌机控制不及，一下就冲到了他的前面，这时他再也按不住心头的怒火，轻侧机翼，对准敌机狠狠地发射。敌机被击中了，同时，他自己的飞机也剧烈地颤抖了一下，失去了平衡，向地面冲去。他马上跳出坐舱，拉开降落伞，以后，他就昏迷过去了。
      想到这里，
  一个强烈的念头在他的脑海里一闪：“得赶快回去！”，他本想纵身跳起，但浑身好像被绳子缚住似地，一动也动不了。
      “腿呢？……”一种恐怖的感觉通过他的全身，他吃力地抬起头来一看，原来他的右腿摔坏了，歪在一边，地上是一片鲜血。
      “还有腿呵！”他极度喜悦地自语着。但剧痛和疲乏又使他昏迷了过去。二  半夜醒来，孙忠国发现自己已躺在包扎所的病床上了。他感到浑身火热，腿部剧痛。他轻轻地用手去摸受伤的腿，他摸着膝盖上部突出来一根骨头再往下摸，又发现在小腿上也有一段骨头突出来了。经过医生诊断，他的右腿已断成三截。
    “腿断成三截，还能飞吗？”他每天都在苦恼地想着。
    不久，他就被转到后方医院来了。他又向大夫提出这样的问题：“腿断成三截，还能飞吗？”出乎他意料之外，一位大夫恳切地告诉他：
    “小伙子，尽管放心吧！我们一定能给你治好，我们准备给它施行‘牵引’，这是一种复杂的手术，不过是很痛的。”
    “大夫，不要紧！”孙忠国好像绝处逢生一样兴奋地说道：“不要紧，怎么能治好就怎么做吧！我决不怕痛的。”
    这时，从部队里给他寄来两本苏联小说——“真正的人”和“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，还有一百八十封慰问信。他贪婪地读着这些书和信。党和战友们对他的热情关怀，密里席叶夫和保尔的英雄形象，是那样的感动着和鼓舞着他。从此，在他的日记上，就不断出现了这样一些章页：
    “×月×日：昨天半夜里腿又痛得厉害，病室里的同志都睡着了。我用手紧紧地抓住床沿，咬住牙，免得哼出声来。睡在我旁边的同伴赶忙翻起身来，对我说：‘你喊吧！别把牙给咬坏了！’可是我怎么能叫呢？我为什么要把自己的痛苦拿去加给别人——自己的同志身上呢？这是一笔血债，这笔债是要记到美国鬼子的身上的。……我还要飞上去，加倍地打击敌人！我就要飞上去！飞上去！……”
    “×月×日：今天看奥斯特洛夫斯基的演讲、论文、书信集。病室很静。我觉得，保尔仿佛就坐在我的身边，对我讲着这些话。……我决不认为我是残废，只要血液在流，脉膊在跳，我就决不停止战斗！……”
    “……不放松一刻的锻炼和提高自己，回部队去！”
    九个月过去了。孙忠国日夜盼望的这一天终于来到。右腿上的石膏拆掉了。他再也抑制不住了日日夜夜藏在心里的那个欲望：“能下地是多好啊，那怕只要下地去站一会。”拆除石膏的大夫刚一走出病房，他就悄悄地起来了。先把左腿踏在地上，再把右腿也慢慢地放到地上，然后试着站起来。还没站稳，只觉得两腿直颤，身子一晃，几乎摔倒，他连忙抓住床沿。停了一停，他又忍着痛，轻轻地向前移动了一步，又停了停，他接着又向前移动了一步。虽然每移动一步，心在激烈地跳，身上在冒汗，但他一直继续到完全无力支持的时候，才倒在床上休息一下。过一会儿，他又挣扎着起来练习，移动脚步时，就像小孩初学走路时的那种姿态，也流露出像小孩初迈步时那种喜悦。
    以后，孙忠国每天都拄着拐杖在走廊和过道里，练习走路了。渐渐，他从走廊走到了院子，从院子走到操场，并且在练习翻双杠了。但由于石膏长期的固定，僵直的腿总是弯不过来。怎么才能使他弯过来呢？
    一次，孙忠国在操场上散步，他看到有几个同志在骑脚踏车。车子跑得很快，骑车人的两腿一伸一屈地蹬着，看着，看着，孙忠国好像得到了什么启示，立刻跑过去，要练习着骑车子。
    他吃力地伸直右腿，翻上去，又轻轻地放下去，慢慢地用脚触到车子的踏板。可是因为只能左腿用力，一踏车子就失掉了平衡，摔了下来。骑上去，摔下来，摔下来，再骑上去，他就这样一次一次地练习着，他终于学会了骑自行车，腿也弯得过来了。
    有一天，孙忠国正在操场上骑车子，一个护士跑来高兴地喊道：“孙同志，体格检查委员会的同志来啦！这是个好机会，快去检查吧！”他一气跑到检查室里。一位大夫看了看他的病历表问道：“你的腿怎么样了？”“很好！”他有力地答道。“很好？你动一动我看看，能弯吗？”医生看着他的腿说。他把腿前后踢了两下，然后往下一蹲又站起来。医生若有所思地说：“嗯，好像还不太灵活。”“不太灵活？”他不服气地反问道，接着就提起裤子跳起来，先是两只腿跳，以后就专用右腿跳。他这突如其来的动作，把全屋子的人都楞住了。他忽然停下来，又走到医生面前问道：“哪儿不灵活？哪儿不灵活？”
    医生愉快地大笑起来，连连点头说道：“灵活，灵活，完全灵活！”顺手拿起戳子，在印台里沾了两下，“当”的一声鲜红的四个大字：“飞行合格”盖在了检查表上。
    三
    清晨，在朝鲜某地的飞机场上，飞行员们正在紧张地做着起飞前的准备工作。天气是如此晴朗，风尘不动，天蓝得像一块天鹅绒一样。当红色信号在空中腾起时，随着马达的轰鸣，孙忠国和他的战友们驾驶的“银燕”飞向高空。他无法控制自己的激动。他从飞机上放眼瞭望：下面是他们保卫着的朝鲜的大好河山，是勇敢勤劳的朝鲜人民；前面，则是美国空中强盗可能闯进来的地方，是需要他去警戒的万里长空；而在后面，在鸭绿江的那一边，有生长和教养了自己的伟大的祖国，有支持和鼓舞着自己的祖国人民。想着这一切，他觉得自己充沛着新生一般的力量！刚刚结束的病院生活仿佛已经过去很久，一年多以前参加战斗的情景就像发生在昨天一样。他不能形容自己兴奋的心情，因为一年多的宿愿：“我还要飞上去，加倍地打击敌人！”今天实现了！（附图片）
