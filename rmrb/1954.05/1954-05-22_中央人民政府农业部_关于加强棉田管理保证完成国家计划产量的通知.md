Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
Notice on Strengthening Cotton Field Management to Ensure the Completion of National Planned Production

At present, the national cotton sowing task has been basically completed. In the future, in order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the arduous task of increasing the average yield of ginned cotton by three jin per mu on the basis of 1953, cadres at all levels in cotton-producing areas should immediately mobilize the masses to conduct seedling checks and replanting, and to prevent and control insect pests in a timely manner, strengthen cotton field management, and overcome natural disasters, so as to reduce abandoned cotton fields and ensure the completion of the planned cotton production. To this end, the following notice is hereby issued:

I. Strengthen the cultivation management of cotton fields. At present, we must do a good job in checking seedlings, replanting, and thinning cotton seedlings to ensure full seedlings and obtain neat and strong cotton plants. At the same time, correct thinning and seedling protection work is also a prerequisite for implementing close planting of cotton. However, some areas have not given due attention to this work, so the phenomenon of missing seedlings is generally serious, and the density of cotton plants has not yet reached the required level. For example, according to a typical survey in Hebei Province in 1953, in many areas, about half of the cotton fields had more than 20% missing seedlings; in the northern cotton area, it is still common to have less than 3,000 plants per mu, and in the southern cotton area, it is common to have less than 2,000 plants per mu of upland cotton, and in some areas, there are only about 1,000 plants. At the same time, in a cotton field, the distribution of cotton plants is uneven. These have greatly affected the yield per unit area. Therefore, it is necessary to organize the masses well, implement "early thinning, even seedling retention, and timely setting of seedlings," advocate careful thinning and setting of seedlings by hand to ensure that cotton seedlings are evenly distributed; if missing seedlings are found, they must be transplanted or replanted in time to ensure full seedlings. And according to local conditions, appropriately increase the number of plants on the basis of the original density.

In addition to doing a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, applying top dressing, cultivating and weeding, irrigating and preventing drought, and draining and preventing waterlogging after the seedling stage, cotton field management must also effectively promote pruning technology to prevent cotton plants from growing excessively, reduce flower and boll shedding, and promote early maturity, in order to increase yield and improve quality. Cotton pruning has been proven from scientific research and mass practice to be a valuable agricultural technology measure. Its main feature is that it can guide cotton plants to economically utilize nutrients and reduce unnecessary consumption. At present, although pruning has been generally carried out in the northern cotton area, the removal of "trousers legs" (lower branches) and topping are late, and the removal of boll clusters and axillary buds has not been generally accepted by the masses; in the southern cotton area, pruning technology is only being tested in farm demonstrations and among a few farmers, and has not been widely promoted. Therefore, all localities should, in light of existing problems, do a good job in publicizing and educating about cotton pruning technology, and steadily promote the correct pruning method of removing "trousers legs" when the first fruiting branch appears, topping when a certain number of fruiting branches are retained, removing boll clusters in time, and removing axillary buds at any time.

II. The state has been able to produce large quantities of "666" (BHC), "DDT" and sprayers and other insecticidal drugs and machinery, and the prices have also been reduced, which provides favorable conditions for the prevention and control of cotton pests. We should extensively mobilize the masses to fully use drugs and machinery to control insects, and strive to avoid cotton yield reduction due to insect pests. If some areas do not have sufficient preparations of "666" and "DDT," they should immediately submit a demand plan to the supply and marketing cooperatives, order goods as soon as possible, so as to avoid insufficient temporary supply. The use of "1605" (Parathion) must be strictly controlled, focusing on qualified farms and agricultural production cooperatives, with special personnel responsible for centralized use to strictly prevent poisoning of people and livestock. Accumulated cotton oil soap and tobacco leaves can be considered by various regions to reduce prices as much as possible for sale, or transfer their use. Actively promote or lease new sprayers and organize the repair of old sprayers stored by cotton farmers. In terms of insect control methods, we should strengthen technical guidance on drug and machine insect control, pay attention to prevention and early treatment, and advocate comprehensive prevention and control methods and combined treatment methods. For example, aphids, spider mites, and mirid bugs in the northern cotton area can be controlled with 0.5% "666" powder to eliminate them in the early stage of spot occurrence; during the bud and boll stage, it is recommended to use "666," "DDT," and other combined treatment agents. In addition, attention should be paid to trapping and killing underground pests.

III. This year, the supply of commercial fertilizers was insufficient before cotton sowing. Therefore, it is necessary to combine with relevant departments such as cooperation and trade to accelerate the processing of cake fertilizer, do a good job in regulating and supplying, and vigorously implement the policy of giving priority to farmers' self-accumulated fertilizer and supplementing with commercial fertilizer, increasing the accumulation of farmers' fertilizer, so that cotton fields can be top-dressed in a timely manner. In terms of fertilization technology, we should advocate economic application to maximize the effectiveness of fertilizer. For example, guide the masses to apply fertilizer by trench or hole, overcome late fertilization, and make cotton plants greedy and late-maturing.

IV. From the beginning of cotton sowing to the completion of harvesting, leaders at all levels must grasp the production season according to local characteristics and carry out unremitting struggles. The main concentrated upland cotton area is the focus of leadership work, but at the same time, we must also pay attention to technical guidance in low-yield cotton areas, new cotton areas, coarse cotton areas, and scattered cotton areas. In the use of technical cadre strength, corresponding allocations must be made according to the above principles. Technical cadres for cotton production who were transferred from cotton areas in 1953 should still be appropriately arranged to work in cotton areas. Technical extension stations in cotton areas must earnestly do a good job in cotton technical guidance, and adopt cotton farmer symposiums, short-term training courses, and organize visits and other methods to conduct technical instruction, focusing on farms and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, through their demonstration role, drive the vast number of individual farmers to improve cotton planting techniques, achieve comprehensive production increase, and complete and overfulfill the national planned tasks.

    中央人民政府农业部
    关于加强棉田管理保证完成国家计划产量的通知
    目前全国已基本完成了棉花播种任务，今后为了保证完成和超额完成全国每亩平均产量在一九五三年基础上增产皮棉三斤的艰巨任务，棉区各级干部应即发动群众进行查苗、补苗，并适时防治虫害，加强棉田管理，战胜自然灾害，以减少废弃棉田，并保证完成棉花计划产量。为此，特作如下通知：
    一、加强棉田的栽培管理，当前要做好棉花的查苗、补苗、间苗工作，保证全苗，获得整齐健壮的棉株。同时正确的间苗、保苗工作，也是实行棉花密植的前提条件。但是若干地区对这一工作还没有给予应有的重视，因而缺苗现象普遍严重，棉株仍未达到应有的密度。如一九五三年河北省典型调查，很多地区的棉田缺苗二成以上的达半数左右；北方棉区每亩在三千株以下，南方棉区细绒棉每亩在二千株以下的，仍很普遍，个别地区还仅有一千株左右；同时在一块棉田里，棉株分布稀密不匀。这些都使单位面积产量受到了很大影响。因此必须很好地组织群众，实行“早间苗、匀留苗、适时定苗”，提倡用手进行仔细的间苗、定苗，使棉苗分布均匀；发现缺苗，必须及时移栽或补种，保证全苗。并根据当地条件，在原有密度的基础上酌量增加株数。
    苗期以后的棉田管理，除须做好防治病虫、施追肥、中耕除草、灌溉防旱、排水防涝等工作，给棉花生长发育创造良好条件外，还要切实推行整枝技术，防止棉株徒长，减少落蕾落铃，促进早熟，才能够增加产量，提高品质。棉花整枝，已从科学研究及群众实践中得到证明，是有价值的农业技术措施之一，其主要特点，是能引导棉花植棵经济利用养分，减少不必要的消耗。目前北方棉区虽已普遍进行整枝，但脱裤腿、摘心较晚，摘群尖、去赘芽尚未被群众普遍接受；南方棉区整枝技术仅在农场示范和少数农民中试行，还没有广泛推广。因此，各地应针对存在的问题，做好关于棉花整枝技术的宣传教育，并稳步推行在第一个果枝现蕾时即行脱裤腿，留够一定数目的果枝即摘心，及时摘群尖，随时去赘芽的正确整枝方法。
    二、国家已能大量生产“六六六”、“滴滴涕”以及喷雾器等治虫药械，价格亦已降低，对防治棉虫提供了有利条件，应广泛地发动群众充分应用药械治虫，力争不因虫害而造成棉花减产。有些地区如“六六六”、“滴滴涕”准备不足，应即向供销合作社提出需用计划，及早订货，以免临时供应不及。使用“一六○五”要严格控制，以有条件的农场、农业生产合作社为重点，专人负责，集中使用，严防人畜中毒。积存的棉油皂和烟叶，可由各地区考虑尽量减低价格出售，或转移用途。积极推销或租借新的喷雾器并组织修理棉农旧存的喷雾器。在治虫方法上，应加强对药械治虫的技术指导，重视预防和早治，提倡综合性的防治及兼治的方法。如蚜虫、红蜘蛛、盲椿象等北方棉区可使用千分之五的“六六六”粉防治，务使消灭在点片发生的初期；蕾铃期害虫可提倡使用“六六六”、“滴滴涕”等兼治药剂。另外对地下害虫，应注意诱杀和捕杀。
    三、今年在棉花播种前商品肥料的供应量不足，因此必须结合合作、贸易等有关部门，加速饼肥加工，做好调剂供应工作，并大力贯彻以农家自积肥料为主，商品肥料为辅的方针，增积农家肥料，使棉田能够及时进行追肥。在施肥技术上，应提倡经济施用，以发挥肥料的最大效能。如指导群众沟施、穴施，克服施肥过晚，使棉花贪青晚熟。
    四、自棉花播种开始至收获完了，各级领导必须按照当地的特点，掌握生产季节，进行不懈的斗争。主要的集中细绒棉区是领导工作的重点，但同时也必须注意低产棉区、新棉区、粗绒棉区以及零星分散棉区的技术指导。在技术干部力量的使用上，须根据上述原则作相应的配备，一九五三年调离棉区的棉产技术干部，仍应适当安排在棉区工作。棉区的技术推广站，必须切实做好棉花技术指导工作，针对当地技术上存在的问题，采用棉农座谈会、短期训练班、组织参观等方法，进行技术传授，以农场和农业生产合作社、互助组为重点，通过他们的示范作用，带动广大个体农民改进植棉技术，达到全面增产，完成和超额完成国家计划任务。
                      一九五四年五月二十日
