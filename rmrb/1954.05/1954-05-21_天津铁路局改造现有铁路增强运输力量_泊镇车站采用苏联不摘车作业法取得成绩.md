    Tianjin Railway Bureau Renovation of Existing Railways to Enhance Transport Capacity
    Bozhen Station Achieves Results Using the Soviet Method of Non-Detachment Operation
  Tianjin Railway Bureau has built many new stations, lines, and transportation equipment to enhance the transportation capacity of existing railways. The volume of transportation of the Tianjin Railway Bureau is continuously increasing, and this year's plan for sending goods is 23.3 percent more than last year. The transportation capacity of major stations and lines is already insufficient. The utilization rate of the line capacity in the eastern district of Shijiazhuang Station has reached 110 percent. The throughput capacity of the Jinpu Line and Jinshan (Shanhaiguan) Line is not enough. In order to solve this contradiction between transportation volume and transportation capacity, in addition to maximizing transportation potential, the Tianjin Railway Bureau has begun to strengthen equipment, open stations, expand marshalling yards, and build new locomotive depots. Between Tianjin and Dezhou on the Jinpu Line, five meeting stations have been built: Shuangtang, Wangguantun, Zhaoguantun, Dazhangzhuang, and Changzhuang. The establishment of these five meeting stations has increased the line throughput capacity between Tianjin and Dezhou by 29.5 percent. Between Luanxian and Zhugezhuang on the Jinshan (Shanhaiguan) Line, a double track has been built and the Luan River Bridge has been rebuilt, increasing the throughput capacity by 42.5 percent. This year, four new meeting stations and nine freight lines will be built on the Jinghan Line. The engineering design of the large-scale Nancang marshalling yard is being prepared by the Ministry of Railways. This year, the investment in capital construction of the Tianjin Railway Bureau will be 96 billion yuan more than the actual completion last year. The vast majority of this year's investment will be used to renovate existing railways and enhance the strength of transportation equipment. (Chen Ji)

    Bozhen Station of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau adopts the Soviet advanced experience - the non-detachment operation method, shortening the vehicle dwell time. In the first quarter of this year, each vehicle stayed at the station for an average of only 5.4 hours, which is 2.9 hours shorter than last year. In April this year, the dwell time of each vehicle was shortened by another 1.1 hours compared to the original target. The shortening of vehicle dwell time has enabled the entire Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau to accelerate vehicle turnaround in March and April this year, over fulfilling the vehicle dwell time target.
    In the process of implementing the non-detachment operation method, all employees of Bozhen Station strengthened contact with the dispatching office, clarified the content of the train in advance, and contacted relevant stations and conductors to verify the content of the forecast and prevent errors in the forecast. According to the forecast and the specific situation of the station, a detailed plan for the non-detachment operation method was formulated and communicated to station attendants, reporters, and loading and unloading workers. This ensures the realization of the non-detachment operation method.
    In order to smoothly implement the non-detachment operation method, loading and unloading workers were also organized to hold technical seminars to improve loading and unloading methods and improve efficiency. In the past, it took 50 minutes to unload a vehicle loaded with grain. After the fifth shift of loading and unloading workers proposed a fast operation for unloading grain, it only took 20 minutes to unload a vehicle.
    Currently, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau has notified all stations to learn and promote the experience of Bozhen Station, implement the non-detachment operation method, and shorten vehicle dwell time.

    天津铁路局改造现有铁路增强运输力量
    泊镇车站采用苏联不摘车作业法取得成绩
  天津铁路管理局新建了许多车站、线路和运输设备，增强现有铁路的运输力量。天津铁路管理局运输量不断增加，今年发送货物的计划比去年增多百分之二十三点三。主要的车站和线路的运输能力已经不足。石家庄车站东区的线路能力的利用率，已达百分之一百一十。津浦线、津山（山海关）线的通过能力不够用。为了解决运输量和运输力之间的这种矛盾，天津铁路管理局除了发挥运输潜力而外，已着手增强设备力量，开辟车站，扩大调车场，新建机务段。在津浦线的天津至德州之间，已经修好了双堂、王官屯、赵官屯、大张庄和长庄等五个会让车站。这五个会让车站的建立，使天津至德州的线路通过能力提高了百分之二十九点五。在津山（山海关）线的滦县至朱各庄之间，修好了一条复线，并改建了滦河桥，提高了通过能力百分之四十二点五。今年还要在京汉线上，新建四个会让车站和九条货物线。规模巨大的南仓调车场的工程设计，正由铁道部编制。今年天津铁路管理局基本建设的投资，比去年实际完成的要多九百六十亿元。今年投资的绝大部分，将用来改造现有铁路，增强运输设备的力量。（陈迹）

    天津铁路分局泊镇车站采用苏联先进经验——不摘车作业法，缩短了车辆停留时间。今年第一季度，每辆车平均只在车站停留了五点四小时，比去年缩短二点九小时。今年四月份，每辆车停留时间又比原定指标缩短一点一小时。车辆停留时间缩短，使得整个天津铁路分局在今年三、四月份加快了车辆的周转，超额完成车辆停留时间的指标。
    泊镇车站全体职工在实行不摘车作业法的过程中，加强了和调度所的联系，事先弄清楚列车的内容，并且和有关车站、车长联系，来核对预报的内容，防止预报的错误。根据预报和车站的具体情况，制订周密的不摘车作业法的计划，把计划传达给站务员、报道员和装卸工人。这样就保证了不摘车作业法的实现。
    为了顺利地实行不摘车作业法，还组织装卸工人，召开技术研究会，改进装卸方法，提高效率。过去卸完一辆装有粮食的车辆，需要五十分钟。该站第五班装卸工人提出了卸粮食的快速作业以后，只用二十分钟，就卸完一辆车。
    目前天津铁路分局已通知各车站，学习和推广泊镇车站的经验，实行不摘车作业法，缩短车辆停留时间。
