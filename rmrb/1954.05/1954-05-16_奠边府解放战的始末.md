    The Beginning and End of the Dien Bien Phu Liberation Battle
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Dai Shulin
    Dien Bien Phu is located on the Muong Thanh Plain, the largest of the four plains in Northwest Vietnam. The Muong Thanh Plain is a rich granary in Northwest Vietnam, extending 20 kilometers north to south and 3 to 8 kilometers east to west. A highway and a river run parallel through the plain. Villages are scattered along both banks of the river and at the foot of the mountains surrounding the plain.
    Dien Bien Phu is one of the important strategic strongholds in Northwest Vietnam, located 100 kilometers south of Lai Chau Province and over 100 kilometers southeast of Phong Saly Province in northern Laos. These three important strategic strongholds—Dien Bien Phu, Lai Chau, and Phong Saly—form a strategic triangle. Dien Bien Phu has long been a military stronghold.
    Navarre took a fancy to this place. He attempted to use Dien Bien Phu as a base to aid the isolated stronghold of Lai Chau and to restore colonial rule over the people of Northwest Vietnam. On the morning of November 20th last year, just as the spearhead of the Vietnamese People's Army's offensive was aimed directly at Lai Chau, French troops hastily airdropped about two parachute battalions into Dien Bien Phu, and later continued to drop more paratroopers. Subsequently, the French army developed outward from Muong Thanh as the center. In the center of the plain, northwest of Muong Thanh, they built a nearly two-kilometer-long steel-plated airfield. On many hills east, west, and north of Muong Thanh, they dug trenches, built bunkers, erected barbed wire fences, and laid minefields. A strong fortification was established at Hang Kang, five kilometers from Muong Thanh, and an airfield was constructed. After much painstaking effort, Navarre believed that he had gained a foothold in Dien Bien Phu and had completed the first step in reoccupying Northwest Vietnam. His second step was to extend from Dien Bien Phu northeast through Tuan Giao to Son La, where he would airdrop paratroopers for reinforcement, and at the same time develop southwestward, extending to the Vietnam-Laos border, establishing a line of strongholds about 200 kilometers long from east to west.
    However, the Vietnamese People's Army shattered Navarre's beautiful dream. The People's Army liberated Lai Chau on December 11th last year. By the end of December, the sound of shovels digging earth for fortifications by the People's Army echoed in the green forests surrounding the Muong Thanh Plain. In February of this year, the Lao People's Liberation Army rapidly liberated Phong Saly, further isolating the French troops at Dien Bien Phu.
    The arrogant French commanders, witnessing this situation, still stubbornly claimed that the Vietnamese People's Army could never capture Dien Bien Phu; at the same time, they constantly added to fortifications and airdropped reinforcements. Until the night of May 5th—the eve of the People's Army's general offensive—French troops still risked bad weather to airlift paratroopers from Hanoi to Dien Bien Phu.
    Before the offensive, the Vietnamese People's Army made the necessary arrangements for this victory. The People's Army's engineering corps opened roads in the high mountains and forests, and built a road more than 60 kilometers long around Dien Bien Phu. After that, teams of laborers rushed to Dien Bien Phu day and night, bringing in all the necessary supplies. The People's Army infantry advanced their positions, which were three kilometers away from the French, to only 200 meters from the French strongholds; some trenches even dug into the French barbed wire fences.
    During this period, the French army constantly sent out a battalion or two, supported by tanks, to attack the People's Army positions, but they were all repelled by the People's Army one by one. At this time, General de Castries, the French commander at Dien Bien Phu, realized that he was tightly surrounded.
    At 3:00 PM on March 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive against the French northern defense line at Dien Bien Phu, and within only four days destroyed the defense line composed of the three resistance centers of Him Lam, Doc Lap, and Ban Keo. After several hours of fierce fighting, the People's Army completely captured the Him Lam stronghold that stretched across three hills. This stronghold was one of the most solid positions in the Dien Bien Phu group of fortifications, with five layers of barbed wire extending more than 100 meters deep. The defending enemy was the 3rd Battalion of the Foreign Legion, which was considered skilled in defense. By the morning of the 15th, the People's Army captured the Doc Lap stronghold, three kilometers north of Muong Thanh, completely annihilating the 5th Battalion of the 7th North African Regiment defending it. On the morning of the 17th, two companies of the puppet 3rd Thai Battalion in Ban Keo, the last stronghold of the French northern defense line at Dien Bien Phu, surrendered to the People's Army. At this point, the French northern defense line had completely collapsed.
    After capturing the French northern defense line, the People's Army's artillery units more effectively controlled the French airfield. French aircraft no longer dared to land at the airfield, and the defending troops relied entirely on airdrops.
    At 3:00 PM on March 30th, the People's Army launched the second offensive against the French at Dien Bien Phu. The battle ended on April 2nd, resulting in the annihilation of another battalion and nine companies of the defending troops, the capture of four hilltop strongholds east of Muong Thanh, and the capture of two strongholds northwest and west of Muong Thanh. After launching two offensives and cutting off the connection between Muong Thanh and Hang Kang, the Vietnamese People's Army had compressed the French forces at Dien Bien Phu, which originally controlled an area of approximately 70 square kilometers, into two small circles within Muong Thanh and Hang Kang, each about 7 and 4 square kilometers respectively. Subsequently, the People's Army continuously launched offensives against the defense line near Muong Thanh. By April 22nd, the People's Army had controlled most of the Muong Thanh airfield, making French airdrops even more difficult. By May 1st, the People's Army had captured and controlled four strongholds east and northwest of Muong Thanh, as well as at Hang Kang. Although the French had launched many counterattacks with the support of artillery and tanks, sometimes as many as eight consecutive counterattacks, the People's Army soldiers calmly repelled the French, each time causing the French to suffer a major defeat.
    At this time, the area of the French defense in Muong Thanh had shrunk to only about one square kilometer, and the French positions at Hang Kang were less than one square kilometer.
    For many days, the French had been continuously airlifting reinforcements from Hanoi to this small area, while also airdropping more supplies to support the besieged French troops. On May 4th alone, more than ten French aircraft dropped supplies with 294 parachutes. But this could not save the Dien Bien Phu French troops from their final demise.
    On May 6th, Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap ordered the People's Army to launch a general offensive against the French at Dien Bien Phu. The People's Army first captured four French strongholds in Muong Thanh, including the last two hilltop positions in eastern Muong Thanh. For many days, de Castries, the French commander at Dien Bien Phu, had regarded these two hilltops as his lifeline. After deploying four infantry companies on these small hills, each about 200 meters across, he also dispatched the four companies and headquarters of the 1st Colonial Parachute Battalion, which had been sporadically airdropped over the four nights from the 2nd to the 5th, to these small hills. According to prisoners, this parachute battalion had originally come to relieve the siege. As a result, this battalion and other defending troops were annihilated together.
    After repelling the last few counterattacks by the French, the People's Army immediately infiltrated the French command center—Muong Thanh—in several directions. At this time, the French army had collapsed. They waved white flags from gun emplacements, using anything white—parachute cloth, white paper, white towels—all were used. Finally, the French soldiers walked out of their fortifications with their hands raised. In a solid fortification, de Castries also became a prisoner of the People's Army.
    That evening, most of the defending enemy at Hang Kang also surrendered. One battalion of French troops broke out and fled, but were completely annihilated after only three kilometers.
    By 10:00 PM on May 7th, one-fifth of the French army's mobile forces (infantry and paratroopers) on the Indochina battlefield had been completely annihilated.

    奠边府解放战的始末
    新华社记者　戴澍霖
    奠边府位于越南西北四大平原中最大的一个平原——芒清平原上。芒清平原是越南西北丰富的谷仓，它南北长二十公里，东西宽三至八公里。一条公路和一条河流平行地穿过平原。河流的两岸和平原四周的山脚下散布着村落。
    奠边府是越南西北重要的战略据点之一，它位于莱州省省会以南一百公里和寮国北部封萨里省省会东南一百多公里的地方。这三个重要的战略据点——奠边府、莱州和封萨里形成了犄角之势。很久以来，奠边府就是军事要地。
    纳瓦尔看中了这个地方。他企图以奠边府为根据地援助孤立的据点莱州，并重新恢复对越南西北地区人民的殖民统治。去年十一月二十日早晨，正当越南人民军攻势的锋芒直指莱州之际，法军就先匆匆向奠边府空投下了约两个伞兵营，以后又继续投下伞兵。后来，法军就以芒清为中心向四周发展。在平原的中心——芒清的西北，建立了一个将近两公里长的铺着钢板的飞机场，在芒清东、西、北的许多山头上，挖壕沟、修碉堡，设立铁丝网，布下地雷网。在距离芒清五公里的航岗建立了强固的据点，并修建了飞机场。经过一番苦心经营，纳瓦尔自以为已经在奠边府站住脚了，重新占领越南西北的第一步走完了。他的第二步计划是：由奠边府向东北经巡教到山萝，并在那产空降伞兵接应，又同时向西南发展，伸到越南、寮国的边界，建立一条东西长约二百公里的据点线。
    但是，越南人民军打破了纳瓦尔这场好梦。人民军在去年十二月十一日解放了莱州。至十二月底，芒清平原四面的绿山丛林中，就响起了人民军修建工事的铁锹掘土的响声。今年二月，寮国人民解放军迅速地解放了封萨里，使奠边府的法军更加孤立了。
    妄自尊大的法军指挥官目睹这种情形，一边还硬着嘴说越南人民军怎么也攻不下奠边府；一边却不断地加修工事和空投援兵。直到五月五日夜间——人民军发起总攻的前夜，法军还冒着恶劣的天气从河内空运伞兵投到奠边府。
    越南人民军在进攻之前，就为这次胜利作了必要的安排。人民军的工兵部队在高山野林中开辟了道路，又在奠边府周围修筑了一条六十多公里长的道路。此后，一队队的民工披星戴月地涌向奠边府，运来了一切需用的物资。人民军的步兵把离法军三公里的阵地一直推进到只离法军据点二百公尺的地方，有的壕沟甚至挖进了法军的铁丝网内。
    在这一段时间内，法军曾不断地派出一个营或两个营在坦克配合下向人民军阵地进攻，但都被人民军一一击退了。这时，奠边府法军司令德卡斯特莱才知道已被紧紧地包围住了。
    三月十三日下午，越南人民军发起对奠边府法军北部防线的进攻，只在四天之内就摧毁了由新兰、独立山、板骄三个抵抗中心构成的防线。经过数小时激战，人民军完全攻下了横跨三个山头的据点新兰。这个据点是奠边府集团据点中最坚固的阵地之一，有纵深达一百多公尺的五层铁丝网，守敌是外籍军团第三营，这个营又是被认为善于防御的。至十五日晨，人民军又攻下了芒清以北三公里的据点独立山，全歼守军第七北非团所属的第五营。十七日上午，奠边府法军北部防线的最后一个据点板骄中的伪军第三泰族营的两个连向人民军投降。至此，法军的北部防线已完全崩溃。
    在攻占法军北部防线之后，人民军的炮兵部队更有效地控制了法军的飞机场。法军飞机再也不敢在机场上降落了，守军完全依靠着空投。
    三月三十日下午，人民军向奠边府法军发起第二次进攻，战斗至四月二日结束，再歼守军一个营和九个连，占领芒清以东的四个山头据点，并占领了芒清西北和以西的两个据点。越南人民军在发动两次进攻并切断了芒清至航岗之间的联系以后，已将原来控制了约七十平方公里区域的奠边府法军压缩在约七平方公里和四平方公里的芒清和航岗这两个小圈子内。接着，人民军又不断向芒清附近防线发动进攻，到四月二十二日，人民军已控制了芒清机场的大部分，使法军空投更加困难。到五月一日，人民军又攻下和控制芒清东面和西北以及航岗的四个据点，法军虽然曾在大炮、坦克配合下进行多次反扑，有时接连反扑达八次之多，但是人民军的战士们镇定地迎击了法军，每次都使法军大败而回。
    此时，芒清法军防地的面积已缩小到只有约一平方公里，航岗法军阵地还不到一平方公里。
    多日来，法军不断地从河内运来援兵空投到这个狭小的地区去，同时更多地空投了许多物资接济被围的法军。五月四日一天中，十多架法军飞机就投下二百九十四个降落伞的物资。但这也不能挽救奠边府法军最后覆没的命运。
    五月六日，武元甲总司令命令人民军向奠边府法军发起总攻击。人民军先攻下了芒清法军的四个据点，其中有芒清东部最后的两个山头阵地。多少天来，奠边府法军司令德卡斯特莱一直把这两个山头当作命根子，他在这两个纵横约二百公尺的小山上布置了四个步兵连后，又把在二日至五日的四个夜晚零散空投下来的殖民伞兵第一营的四个连和营部分派到这两个小山上。据俘虏说：这个伞兵营原是来解围的。结果，这个营和其它守军一同被歼灭了。
    人民军在打退了法军最后的几次反扑后，立即分数路插进法军的指挥中心——芒清。这时，法军已经崩溃，他们从枪眼中伸出白旗摇幌着，凡是白色的东西——降落伞布、白纸、白毛巾都被利用了；最后法军一个个举着手走出了工事。在一个坚固的工事里，德卡斯特莱也成了人民军的俘虏。
    当晚，航岗的大部守敌也束手待俘。有一营法军突围逃跑，但只走出三公里，就被全部消灭了。
    五月七日下午十时止，法军在印度支那战场上的五分之一的机动兵力（步兵和伞兵）就这样地全部被歼灭了。
