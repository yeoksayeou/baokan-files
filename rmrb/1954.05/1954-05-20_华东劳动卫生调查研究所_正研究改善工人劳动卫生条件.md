    The "steam injection cooling" equipment designed by the East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute for the Pukou ferry of the Shanghai Railway Administration has now completed preliminary theoretical research. This is one of the eleven special research projects of the institute in 1954. It utilizes the excess steam in the ferry during the summer to lower the high temperature in the engine room. The East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute, together with experts from the Shanghai Railway Administration, collected various Soviet and domestic materials related to steam and cooling, and conducted research for four to five months. Based on this design theory, large-scale factories in heavy industry, textile industry, etc., can install this modern cooling equipment. The research staff of the East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute will also go to Nanjing to collect data on the climate of the Yangtze River surface and the temperature of the river water as a reference for the final design and on-site installation. The "key cooling" (air shower) equipment successfully tested by the East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute last year has been installed and used in the Shanghai Electric Power Company Power Plant, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Factory, Shunfeng Enamel Factory, etc. This year, the institute will conduct further measurement research on the "key cooling" equipment to develop design schemes for different air environments. Recently, the research staff of the East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute also designed a "mobile well water spray cooling" device for the state-owned Shandong Sulfuric Acid Plant, placing the spray and air supply parts on a vehicle that can be moved to the required place in the workshop at any time.
    In terms of occupational diseases and industrial hygiene testing, the research staff has selected important issues urgently needed to be resolved in factories and mines for special research. The East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute has investigated and studied the processing and production process of ore and quartz powder, which are in great demand in basic construction, as well as the occurrence and development of workers' lung diseases in four Shanghai quartz powder dry grinding plants. They also plan to go to Huainan Coal Mine and a certain copper mine to investigate the health of rock drilling workers, and conduct animal silicosis experiments in the laboratory, preparing to make a relatively complete investigation and research report on silicosis. Coal mine and gas plant workers often suffer from "carbon monoxide" poisoning during operation because "carbon monoxide" is colorless and odorless, making it difficult to prevent. Now, the East China Labor Hygiene Investigation Institute has begun to study the rapid determination and microanalysis method of "carbon monoxide," and plans to design a "color alarm" for workshops containing "carbon monoxide." This alarm can automatically display different colors according to the amount of "carbon monoxide" in the workshop air, so workers can take measures to avoid the hazards of "carbon monoxide" based on this alarm.

    华东劳动卫生调查研究所
    正研究改善工人劳动卫生条件
    华东劳动卫生调查研究所为上海铁路管理局浦口号轮渡设计的“蒸汽喷射降温”设备，现在已完成初步的理论研究。这是该所一九五四年十一个专题研究项目之一。它是利用轮渡夏季多余的蒸汽来降低机舱间的高温。华东劳动卫生调查研究所曾和上海铁路管理局的有关专家收集了苏联和国内有关蒸汽和降温方面的各种资料，进行了四、五个月的研究。根据这一设计理论，重工业、纺织工业等较大规模的工厂都可以装建这种现代化的降温设备。华东劳动卫生调查研究所的研究工作人员还将到南京去收集长江江面气候和江水温度等资料，作为最后设计和现场装置的参考。华东劳动卫生调查研究所去年实验成功的“重点降温”（空气淋浴）设备已在上海电力公司发电厂、上海钢铁公司第三厂、顺风搪瓷厂等装建使用，今年该所将对“重点降温”设备作进一步的测定研究，以制定各种空气环境不同的设计方案。最近华东劳动卫生调查研究所的研究工作人员又为国营山东制酸厂设计了一种“流动式井水喷雾降温”设备，把喷雾、送风部分装置在车子上，可以随时移动到车间需要的地方去。
    在职业病、工业卫生化验方面，研究工作人员选择了当前厂矿中急待解决的重要问题进行专题研究。华东劳动卫生调查研究所已在上海四个石英粉干磨厂调查研究了基本建设中大量需用的矿石、石英粉的加工生产过程，以及工人肺病的发生、发展情形。他们还准备到淮南煤矿和某铜矿去调查凿岩工人的健康情况，并在实验室作动物矽肺试验，准备作一比较完整的矽肺病的调查研究报告。煤矿和煤气工厂的工人在操作中常常发生“一氧化碳”中毒，因为“一氧化碳”无色无味，很难预防。现在华东劳动卫生调查研究所已开始研究“一氧化碳”的快速测定和微量分析法，并计划给含有“一氧化碳”空气的车间设计一种“彩色警报”，这种警报可以随着车间空气中“一氧化碳”含量的多少自动显示出不同的颜色，工人就可以根据这种警报设法避免“一氧化碳”的危害。　（新华社）
