    Further Strengthen People's Supervision Work

    The recently held Third National Supervision Work Conference summarized the supervision work of the past year and resolved pressing issues in the supervision work. The conference clearly defined the future tasks of the supervisory organs, which are to further combat illegal and derelict behaviors within government organs and among their staff, prevent and overcome all behaviors that hinder and undermine the general line of the transition period, supervise and inspect the correct implementation of various policies and laws, supervise and inspect the implementation of national construction plans, and accept accusations and complaints from the people against government organs and their staff.

    Through the struggle against corruption and waste in 1952 and the subsequent struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, many of the undesirable phenomena in our state organs and staff, especially corruption and theft, have been greatly overcome. However, these phenomena have not been completely eliminated. In many organs and enterprises, these undesirable phenomena are still quite serious. This is a great obstacle to the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Experience has proven that, in order to implement the leadership and supervision of Party and government organs, it is necessary to have people's supervisory organs dedicated to supervising and inspecting, to conduct daily struggles against these undesirable phenomena, constantly expose them, and seriously deal with them, so that these phenomena can be gradually overcome and even eliminated, to ensure the implementation of national policies and the serious observance and correct realization of national construction plans and various disciplines and systems. Therefore, in the period when our country is transitioning to socialism, the people's supervision work must be continuously strengthened and cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

    The Third National Supervision Work Conference requested that supervision organs and personnel, in their struggle against the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena, should firmly grasp and correctly utilize the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. This is completely correct and necessary. In some of our state organs and staff, especially among some responsible leading cadres, as pointed out by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, an extremely dangerous sense of pride is growing. They become dizzy with success in their work, forget the humble attitude and spirit of self-criticism that a Communist Party member must possess, and can only listen to flattery and praise, not criticism and supervision. In some supervision organs and among some supervision cadres, there is also a weak phenomenon of being ineffective in the struggle against the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena and being unable to adhere to principles. They are concerned about personal gains and losses, afraid of offending people, and afraid of being retaliated against, so they cannot boldly and timely expose various shortcomings and errors, especially afraid of exposing the shortcomings and errors of certain responsible cadres. This situation seriously hinders and delays the correction and overcoming of various undesirable phenomena.

    To change this situation, it is necessary to organize regular criticism and self-criticism in all government organs and among all staff, constantly alerting all personnel, especially responsible cadres, to pay attention to and earnestly overcome all shortcomings and errors, so that they do not spread and expand, causing more serious harm. This requires developing mass self-criticism and supervision from the bottom up, seriously strengthening the handling of people's letters and receiving people, strengthening the activities of people's supervision correspondents, and actively supporting their exposure and accusations of various shortcomings and errors, so that some problems that have not been discovered by the leading organs and supervision organs can be exposed in time under the supervision of the masses. It is also necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism within the supervision organs and among supervision cadres, on the one hand, to correct the phenomena of some supervision personnel being weak and powerless in the struggle against undesirable tendencies and daring not to adhere to principles, and on the other hand, to correct the ideological style of some supervision personnel of being proud and complacent, self-righteous, and subjectively one-sided, improve the political awareness, political sense of responsibility, and ability to judge problems of cadres, so that they can carry out uncompromising struggles on major principled issues in a realistic manner. The people's supervision organs should carry out regular supervision and inspection of the development of criticism and self-criticism in all government organs and the handling of people's letters and receiving people, help overcome shortcomings, and continuously improve their work.

    The Third National Supervision Work Conference stipulated that the focus of supervision and inspection by the people's supervision organs in the future is the country's financial and economic enterprises, with particular emphasis on important state-owned enterprises, that is, the socialist enterprise sector. This is of extremely important significance. Because these departments, on the one hand, need to use a large amount of state funds, and on the other hand, they also need to accumulate a large amount of funds for the country's socialist industrialization. The quality of their work directly affects the speed of socialist accumulation and national industrialization.

    The purpose of supervision and inspection by the supervision organs on financial and economic enterprises is, on the one hand, to effectively and timely prevent and eliminate all corruption, theft, squandering, waste, and other violations of financial discipline, production plans, and state policies and laws; on the other hand, it is to actively promote the improvement of the work of these departments, improve the level of cadres in managing enterprises, and accelerate the speed of capital accumulation.

    In order to meet this requirement, it is necessary to combine it with China's actual situation, actively learn from the advanced experience of Soviet supervision work, and gradually improve the supervision work of various financial and economic enterprises. The experience of the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau's supervision work is the experience learned from the Soviet railway supervision work. The characteristics of this experience are: First, the tasks are clear, and strict supervision is carried out on the income, expenditure, custody, statistics, and management of state assets. Second, there is a complete and effective set of working methods that are adapted to the tasks. It starts with reviewing the production and financial plan; during the implementation of the plan, it conducts daily prior audits of all cash expenditures, the signing of various contracts, and the allocation of materials, supplemented by partial and comprehensive post-event inspections, and promptly puts forward suggestions for correcting shortcomings and improving work. It also reviews and analyzes the quarterly and annual summaries (final accounts) of the production and financial plan, gives appropriate evaluations, exposes its shortcomings and errors, analyzes the reasons, and puts forward improvement opinions. Third, there is a guarantee of an independent and vertical supervision organization system. The Harbin Railway Audit Bureau is directly under the leadership of the central Ministry of Railways and supervises the Harbin Railway Bureau system. This ensures that supervision cadres are not affected by any localism or departmentalism, and it is convenient to resolutely struggle against all shortcomings, errors, and undesirable phenomena of the supervised enterprises or organs.

    The experience of Harbin Railway Audit work is worthy of attention. However, when applying these experiences in various places, it is necessary to combine them with the specific local conditions, and should not copy them mechanically. As long as this advanced supervisory work experience is correctly applied, it will help railway enterprises and Party and government leading organs to discover various phenomena that violate policies and laws in time, so that they can be corrected in time, and effectively plug loopholes in many aspects, prevent the occurrence of various undesirable phenomena, thereby effectively strengthening and consolidating financial discipline and production discipline, and effectively implementing various policies and laws. With the strengthening of supervision work, the unrealistic aspects in the formulation of enterprise production and financial plans will be discovered and corrected in time, so that the plan is both realistic and can promote production. The supervision and inspection of daily work based on the plan will constantly remind enterprise leaders and all employees to pay attention to correctly completing the plan. The establishment and implementation of planned management and economic accounting systems will also be strongly guaranteed.

    In China's railway system, this advanced supervisory work experience is being fully promoted. It will promote the rapid improvement of the work of China's railway enterprises. In other financial and economic enterprise departments, the basic spirit of this advanced experience is also applicable. However, at present, due to the lack of necessary cadre preparation, experience preparation, and other preparations, it is impossible to fully implement it all at once, but only to adopt the method of focusing on pilot projects and gradually promoting it. However, some comrades, under the pretext that China's general enterprises are relatively backward, oppose the promotion of this advanced supervisory work experience. This is wrong. The facts of the Harbin Railway Bureau have proved that it is not necessary to wait until there are no backward phenomena in the management of enterprises before establishing an advanced supervision system, but to use an advanced supervision system to promote the overcoming of backward phenomena. It is more difficult to try out this system in relatively backward enterprises, but this only shows that more arduous efforts need to be made in all aspects, rather than that it is fundamentally impossible or should not be implemented.

    Some comrades say that the implementation of this work experience will give supervisory personnel too much power, affect the exercise of powers by enterprise leaders, and delay work. This is also wrong. The experience of the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau proves that the implementation of this system, in fact, only helps enterprise cadres to be more correct and effective in exercising their powers, and avoid the occurrence and development of errors, and will never hinder them from correctly exercising their powers. In fact, some people who hold this doubt start from a very incorrect motive. They are unwilling to accept supervision and are afraid of losing so-called "freedom," so they put forward various excuses to oppose the implementation of this advanced supervisory work experience. These comrades should be told that many shortcomings and errors in the past occurred precisely because they were too "free"; they spent money and used people at will, without strictly following the state's policies, laws, and the enterprise's plans and systems. In order to avoid serious consequences and for the benefit of the country, their "freedom" must be strictly restrained.

    In departments and units that are not yet piloting this system, on the one hand, the supervisory organs should continue to seize the main erroneous tendencies, concentrate their efforts, conduct in-depth inspections with a focus, vigorously deal with major issues, and conduct education, in order to give full play to the role of supervision work. On the other hand, they should also organize supervisory personnel to study the advanced Soviet supervisory work experience, conduct ideological preparation, and gradually absorb this advanced supervisory system, in order to strengthen and improve China's supervisory work and promote the further improvement and improvement of the entire enterprise work.

    Since the supervision work of the enterprise department is a powerful assistant to the Party committee in supervising the enterprise, and also a powerful assistant to the administration in leading the enterprise, the Party and the administration must vigorously support it and actively lead Party members and all employees to seriously assist it; instead of thinking that supervision work is only the business of the supervision organs and ignoring it. At the same time, supervisory personnel must also realize that their political level is not high, and their work experience and business knowledge are still very lacking, so they must study hard, be humble and prudent, be conscientious and responsible, and prevent subjective one-sidedness and abuse of power. All supervision workers should, under the leadership of the Party and governments at all levels, faithfully and correctly fulfill their responsibilities and complete this arduous and glorious task.

    进一步加强人民监察工作
    最近召开的第三次全国监察工作会议，总结了一年来的监察工作，解决了监察工作中急需解决的问题。会议明确规定了今后监察机关的任务，是进一步向政府机关及其工作人员中的违法失职行为作斗争，防止和克服一切阻碍和破坏过渡时期总路线的行为，监督检查各种政策法令的正确贯彻执行，监督检查国家建设计划的执行，受理人民群众对政府机关及其工作人员的检举控告。
    经过一九五二年反对贪污浪费的斗争和以后进行的反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，我们的许多国家机关和工作人员中的贪污、浪费、官僚主义和违反政策、法令、纪律、制度等不良现象，尤其是贪污盗窃的现象，得到了很大的克服。但是这些现象并没有完全消灭。在不少机关和企业单位中，这些不良现象还相当严重。这对于国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业是一种很大的障碍。经验证明，为要贯彻党政机关的领导和监督，必须有专事监督检查的人民监察机关来和这些不良现象进行日常的斗争，不断地揭发，认真地处理，才有可能逐渐克服以至消灭这些现象，以保证国家政策的贯彻执行，保证国家的建设计划和各种纪律、制度被认真遵守和正确实现。因此，在我们国家向社会主义过渡的时期，人民监察工作必须不断加强，而不能丝毫放松。
    第三次全国监察工作会议要求监察机关和监察人员在与上述各种不良现象作斗争时，要紧紧地掌握和正确地运用批评和自我批评这一武器。这是完全正确的和必要的。在我们的一部分国家机关和工作人员中，尤其是一部分负责的领导干部中，确实是像党的七届四中全会所指出的，正在滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督。在一部分监察机关和监察干部中，也有对上述不良现象斗争不力、不能坚持原则的软弱现象。他们顾虑到个人的得失，怕得罪人，怕受打击报复，就不能大胆地及时揭露各种缺点和错误，尤其是怕揭露某些负责干部的缺点和错误。这种情形，严重地障碍和拖延了各种不良现象的纠正和克服。
    要改变这种状况，就必须在所有政府机关和工作人员中组织经常的批评和自我批评，随时警醒所有人员尤其是负责干部，使他们重视并认真克服所有的缺点和错误，使它不至蔓延和扩大，造成更严重的危害。这就必须发展群众性的自下而上的批评和监督，认真加强处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，加强人民监察通讯员的活动，积极支持他们对各种缺点和错误的揭发和控告，使一些没有被领导机关和监察机关发现的问题，能在群众的监督之下被及时暴露出来。还必须在监察机关和监察干部中开展批评和自我批评，一方面纠正某些监察人员在反对不良倾向的斗争中表现软弱无力、不敢坚持原则的现象，另一方面纠正某些监察人员的骄傲自满、自以为是、主观片面等思想作风，提高干部的政治觉悟、政治责任心和判别问题的能力，使他们能够实事求是地在重大的原则问题上作不妥协的斗争。对于所有政府机关中开展批评和自我批评以及处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，人民监察机关应该实行经常的监督检查，帮助克服缺点，不断改进工作。
    第三次全国监察工作会议规定人民监察机关今后监督检查的重点是国家的财经企业部门，目前特别着重在重要的国营企业，即社会主义企业部门。这是具有极其重要的意义的。因为这些部门一方面要大量使用国家的资金，另一方面也要为国家社会主义工业化大量积累资金。它们工作的好坏，直接影响着社会主义积累和国家工业化的速度。
    监察机关对财经企业部门实行监督检查的目的，一方面是要有效地，及时地防止与消除一切贪污、盗窃、挥霍浪费和其他违犯财政纪律、违反生产计划及违反国家政策法令的不良现象；另一方面则是要积极地促进这些部门工作的改善，提高干部经营管理企业的水平，加快资金积累的速度。
    为了适应这个要求，必须结合我国实际情况，积极学习苏联监察工作的先进经验，逐步提高各财经企业部门的监察工作。哈尔滨铁路稽核局监察工作的经验，就是从苏联铁路监察工作学习来的经验。这种经验的特点是：第一，任务明确，对国家资财的收入、支出、保管、统计以及管理工作，实行严格的监督。第二，有一套完整的、有效的、与任务相适应的工作方法。它从审查生产财务计划入手；在计划执行中，对一切现金开支、签订各种合同及物料调配等活动进行日常的事先稽核，又辅之以部分的和全面的事后检查，及时地提出纠正缺点、改进工作的建议。并对生产财务计划的季度、年度总结（决算）进行审查分析，给予恰当的评价，揭发其缺点错误，分析原因，提出改进意见。第三，有着独立垂直的监察组织系统的保证。哈尔滨铁路稽核局直接受中央铁道部的领导，对哈尔滨铁路局系统进行监督。这就保证监察干部不受任何地方主义和本位主义的影响，便于对被监督的企业或机关的一切缺点、错误和不良现象进行坚决的斗争。
    哈尔滨铁路稽核工作的经验是值得重视的。但是各地运用这些经验的时候，还必须与当地具体情况相结合，而不应该生硬地搬用。只要正确地运用这种先进的监察工作经验，就将会帮助铁道企业单位和党政领导机关，及时地发现各种违犯政策法令的现象，使它得到及时纠正，并且在许多方面有效地堵塞漏洞，防止各种不良现象的发生，从而有效地加强和巩固财政纪律和生产纪律，有效地贯彻各种政策法令。随着监察工作的加强，制订企业生产财务计划中不切合实际的地方，将被及时地发觉和纠正，使计划既切合实际而又能推进生产。依据计划所进行的日常工作的监督检查，将不断地提醒企业领导者和所有职工群众去注意正确地完成计划。计划管理和经济核算制的建立和贯彻，也将得到有力的保证。
    在我国铁路系统，这一先进的监察工作经验正在全面推行。它将促进我国铁路企业工作迅速提高。在其他财经企业部门，这一先进经验的基本精神也是可用的。但目前由于还缺乏必要的干部准备、经验准备和其他准备，因此不可能一下子全面推行，而只能采取重点试行、逐步推广的办法。但是，有些同志借口我国一般企业比较落后，就反对推广这种先进的监察工作经验。这是不对的。哈尔滨铁路局的事实已经证明，不是要等到企业的经营管理上完全没有了落后现象才去建立先进的监察制度，而是要以先进的监察制度来促进落后现象的克服。在比较落后的企业单位中试行这种制度有着比较多的困难，但这只是说明需要在各方面作更艰巨的努力，而不是根本不可能或不应该实行。
    有的同志说，推行这种工作经验，会使监察人员权力太大，影响企业领导干部行使职权，耽误工作。这也是不对的。哈尔滨铁路稽核局的经验证明，这种制度实行起来，事实上只是帮助企业干部在行使职权时作得更正确，更有成效，避免错误的发生和发展，而决不会妨害他们正确地行使职权。实际上，抱着这种疑虑的人，有一些是从一种很不正确的动机出发的。他们不愿意接受监督，害怕失去所谓“自由”，因而提出这样那样的借口来反对实行这种先进的监察工作经验。应该告诉这些同志：过去许多缺点和错误的发生，正是因为他们太“自由”了；他们随意开支，随意用人，而不严格按照国家的政策法令和企业的计划、制度办事。为了避免严重的后果，为了国家的利益，他们的这种“自由”是必须严加约束的。
    在目前还不试行这种制度的部门和单位中，监察机关一方面应该继续抓住主要的错误倾向，集中力量，有重点地深入检查，大张旗鼓地处理重大问题，进行教育，以发挥监察工作的作用。另一方面，也应该组织监察人员学习苏联先进监察工作经验，进行思想上的准备，并逐步地吸取这种先进监察制度，以加强和提高我国监察工作，促进整个企业工作的进一步改善和提高。
    由于企业部门的监察工作是党委监督企业的有力助手，也是行政方面领导企业的有力助手，所以党和行政都必须大力给以支持，积极领导党员和全体职工认真协助；而不应该认为监察工作只是监察机关的事而置之不理。同时，监察人员也必须认识自己的政治水平还不高，工作经验和业务知识还十分缺乏，因此必须努力学习，谦虚谨慎，认真负责，防止主观片面，滥用职权。所有监察工作人员应该在党和各级政府的领导下，忠实地正确地履行自己的职责，完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务。
