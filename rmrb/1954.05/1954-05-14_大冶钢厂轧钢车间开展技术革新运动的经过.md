    On April 1st, the Rolling Mill Workshop of Daye Steel Plant officially put the "anti-guide plate" and "anti-vertical guide plate" into production, saving thirty man-hours per day and increasing output by 15 percent. Including the equipment they had previously improved, they saved a total of more than 180 man-hours per day. Calculated on an annual basis, this could save more than 50,000 man-hours. At the same time, it greatly reduces the labor intensity of other operations that still use manual labor. Their production plans can therefore be consistently overfulfilled.

    Over the past year or so, the comrades in the Rolling Mill Workshop have gained an experience: the more backward the original production equipment, the more seriously we should carry out the technical innovation movement, use machinery to replace heavy manual labor, tap the potential of equipment, and improve labor productivity.

    Backward Production Equipment Must Be Improved
    The production equipment in the Rolling Mill Workshop of Daye Steel Plant is very backward. The motor capacity is very small, and the circuit breaker trips easily if not careful. From the time the steel ingot enters the factory to the time the steel leaves the factory, every production process is inseparable from heavy manual labor. Every day, cold bed workers have to drag hot and heavy steel back and forth. On the small rolling mill, red steel is rolled into steel in eleven passes. Each time, the workers bend over to operate the machine, causing backaches and sore bones. And this red steel, which gets longer and longer as it is rolled, is like a fire snake darting around the workers. If they are not careful, they will burn their arms and scorch their legs. On both sides of the first stand of the blooming mill, 130-kilogram red steel ingots, heated to more than 1,100 degrees, are carried by four workers with iron bars and guided into the rolling groove by one worker with tongs. If the tong operator is even slightly slow, the people carrying the bars feel anxious and their legs tremble, but they have to endure it until the red steel is sent into the rolling groove before they can breathe a sigh of relief, and then the next red steel ingot is urging them on. In such an environment, almost no one has been injured. Workers Li Wenbing and Cheng Yuansheng were burned on the head by red steel and almost lost their lives. In the hot summer, many workers could not stand the high temperature and heavy labor and fainted, resulting in a significant decline in production.

    The current workshop director, Qiu Fangren, was originally an old rolling mill worker. When he came to Daye Steel Plant in 1951 and saw these scenes, his heart tightened: "How can we talk about increasing production when the comrades are so miserable!" He was determined to rely on the masses to find ways to reduce physical labor. Initially, he suggested learning from the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel and using crowbars instead of four people to carry red steel, saving thirty man-hours a day while increasing production by 20 percent. The success of this improvement inspired the workers and educated the technicians. Everyone actively put forward opinions on improving production. In two years, they implemented more than 30 major rationalization proposals, including the steel coiling machine made by transportation worker Shao Wenshan, the mechanical switch for furnace doors jointly developed by heating furnace worker Zhou Hongbin and engineer Tang Renxiao, and the steel grabbing machine made by Qiu Fangren. These saved 64 workers every day and increased the output of various steels by one to three and a half times. They overfulfilled the 1952 national production plan by 35 percent.

    Taking the Road of Technical Innovation
    Most of the above improvements were limited to minor equipment, and everyone believed that there was no room for improvement in the rolling mill, the most important piece of equipment, because the motor capacity was too small. As a result, their production was severely affected by the seasons. In hot weather, many workers got sick, production generally declined, and they were often threatened with production shutdowns. In the summer of 1953, fitter Yu Bingsen, who had worked in rolling mills for four years, tentatively produced a "positive guide plate" with the help of engineer Li Bangxian. The red steel would automatically enter the next stand after coming out of the previous one. However, the workers were unwilling to use it. The reason was that the output after installing the "positive guide plate" was much lower than with manual operation. Everyone would rather suffer a little more than fail to complete the national plan. Everyone affirmed their original view: "Our motor capacity is too small. How can we compare with the factories in Anshan Iron and Steel!" So the suggestion for the "positive guide plate" was shelved.

    When discussing the annual national plan last May, the production quota was increased by 32 percent compared to the previous year, and workers generally had concerns: "It will be difficult to meet this quota in the summer!" At this time, Zhang Mingshan's experience in creating the "anti-guide plate" pointed them in the direction of taking the road of technical innovation. The Party branch and the trade union put forward the slogan "Improve operating conditions and gradually move towards mechanization," and mobilized all employees to put forward rationalization proposals. The Party branch secretary personally talked to Yu Bingsen and mobilized him to continue to study the reasons for the failure of the "positive guide plate." Engineer Li Bangxian also encouraged Yu Bingsen not to give up in the face of difficulties. Yu Bingsen was determined to learn from Zhang Mingshan's spirit of hard work and perseverance in creating the "anti-guide plate" and to find the path to success from failure. Whenever he had free time, he would squat beside the rolling mill to watch the workers operate it. He finally figured out the problem: manual operation meant that a steel bar only went through one rolling groove at a time, so the rolling mill could roll five or six bars simultaneously. However, the "positive guide plate" was too short, and one steel bar would occupy two or even three rolling grooves, reducing the number of steel bars that could be rolled. If one or two more bars were rolled, it would exceed the motor's load, causing the circuit breaker to trip and reducing output. He excitedly told engineer Li Bangxian about this new discovery, and Li Bangxian immediately helped him calculate the rolling speed and appropriately lengthen the body of the guide plate so that one steel bar would only go through one rolling groove, which finally made the "positive guide plate" a success, breaking the old view that the motor capacity was too small and the rolling mill could not be improved. During this period, everyone also put forward more than ten rationalization proposals for replacing manual labor with machinery, and successively installed two automatic roller conveyors, an automatic trolley for feeding red steel, and a mechanical switch for furnace doors. This saved 48 workers every day and greatly reduced the physical labor of the cold bed workers. Last summer, the absenteeism rate in the workshop decreased from a peak of 25 percent to 16 percent, and from a low of 13 percent to 4 percent. Even when the workers were still not skilled in mastering the new technologies, production maintained its original level and the national plan was completed every month.

    After the summer, the workers put forward more than 60 technical innovation proposals and further grasped the laws of the new technologies, gradually increasing output. The output of ordinary steel generally increased by 20 percent, and the output of high-quality steel more than doubled. They also successfully overfulfilled the 1953 national plan by more than 17 billion yuan (total output value).

    Utilizing Collective Wisdom to Manufacture the "Anti-Vertical Guide Plate"
    At the end of last year, the people in the Rolling Mill Workshop of Daye Steel Plant eagerly hoped to get the "anti-guide plate" up and running, but they dragged on for six months without success. Qiu Fangren carefully studied the experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel and Tangshan Steel Plant in the newspaper and further understood that major technical innovations must be supported from top to bottom and be specifically responsible by a professional team. However, they only asked Yu Bingsen to do it alone. Yu Bingsen also made the mistake of empiricism, not following the drawings and making the "anti-guide plate" almost the same as the "positive guide plate." When the experiment failed, he couldn't find the reason. Some technicians knew that the manufacturing was wrong, but they were afraid to interfere. Qiu Fangren made a self-criticism at the Party branch committee meeting and advocated organizing the technical forces of the workshop (including technicians and veteran technical workers) to form a mechanization professional team to utilize collective wisdom. Once the professional team was established, problems related to the improvement of mechanical equipment were discussed and studied in this team. After the team made a decision, it was responsible for its execution according to the division of labor, in order to summarize the reasons for success and failure. In this way, the "anti-guide plate" was successful in the first experiment.

    Immediately afterwards, probationary technician Wu Wuzhang suggested learning from the Soviet "anti-vertical guide plate." This would enable small rolling mills with small motor capacity and few stands to be fully mechanized from the second stand onwards. The "anti-vertical guide plate" is the most difficult of all guide plates to make, and the difficulties were even greater given the technical level of the Rolling Mill Workshop of Daye Steel Plant. There were no precise instruments for drawing, and the manufacturing was entirely manual. In particular, it was difficult to make the "anti-vertical guide plate" in the book suitable for their poorly equipped rolling mill. But they realized the great power of collective wisdom from the manufacturing of the "anti-guide plate" and still tried to make it with confidence.

    In order to ensure the success of the trial production of the "anti-vertical guide plate," the Party branch general meeting of the workshop specially passed a resolution calling on all employees to firmly support it and requiring Party members to take the lead in ensuring the smooth progress of the work. Workshop director Qiu Fangren personally presided over the professional team meetings to study the problems and made specific divisions of labor. Probationary technician Wu Wuzhang was responsible for drawing, engineer Li Bangxian was responsible for solving technical theoretical problems, workers such as Liu Zhenzhong of the mechanical team were responsible for manufacturing, Yu Bingsen was responsible for material supply, and he himself was responsible for all the coordination and cooperation of other parts of the workshop, in addition to comprehensively leading the work. As a result, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher. Wu Wuzhang did not rest for five days during the Spring Festival and came up with many ways to rush out the drawings. The workers in the mechanical team initially couldn't even understand the drawings because they were so complex, but they often discussed with the technicians and came up with many ways to finally make the plate body meet the specifications by hand. Each time, Qiu Fangren and the members of the professional team personally participated in the installation and adjustment of the machine to find problems. Some workers who did not have specific tasks also rushed to help. Whenever a new problem was discovered, everyone discussed it on the spot and solved it in a timely manner. Although the experiment had not been successful after three trials, the leaders of Daye Steel Plant continued to support it and approved their suspension of production for one day to conduct the experiment. They finally successfully trial-produced the "anti-vertical guide plate" on February 27. When the red steel smoothly passed through the "anti-vertical guide plate" and entered the next rolling groove, the Party branch secretary and some veteran workers applauded and cheered, and the young workers were even more excited and jumped up. All the squad leaders went to Qiu Fangren and asked to let their squad be the first to try out these new guide plates.

    Now, they are organizing workers to exchange experiences with each other so that everyone can master the laws of using these guide plates and solve the new problems caused by these new technologies, consolidate the existing achievements. At the same time, they plan to further mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals on this basis and launch a new labor competition centered on technical innovation. The various workshops of Daye Steel Plant have also begun to actively learn from their experience. The forging workshop inspected its past work and established a professional team to specifically study and handle suggestions related to production innovation. The iron smelting workshop is preparing to immediately mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals so that they can use the upcoming furnace overhaul opportunity to change their original fully manual production equipment to semi-mechanized equipment and further improve labor productivity.

    大冶钢厂轧钢车间开展技术革新运动的经过
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    大冶钢厂轧钢车间于四月一日将“反围盘”和“反立围盘”正式投入生产了，每天节省了三十个人工，并提高了产量百分之十五。连他们以前改进的设备在内，每天一共节省了一百八十多个人工，如以一年计算，可以节省五万多个人工，同时使其他现在还用人工操作的劳动强度大大减轻。他们的生产计划也因此能以经常超额完成。
    一年多来，轧钢车间的同志们取得了一条经验：原有的生产设备越落后，就越应该认真开展技术革新运动，用机械代替沉重的人力劳动，发挥设备潜力，提高劳动生产率。
    落后的生产设备必须改进
    大冶钢厂轧钢车间的生产设备很落后。马达能力很小，稍不注意便会超过负荷造成跳开关事故。从钢锭进厂到钢材出厂，每一道生产过程都离不了沉重的人力劳动。冷床工每人每天要拖着又烫又重的钢材来回跑。在小型轧钢机上，由红钢轧成钢材得轧十一次，每次都由工人弯着腰操作，弯得人腰酸骨痛。而这越轧越长的红钢，就像火蛇似地在工人四周窜来窜去，稍不注意，就会被它烙伤胳膊烫坏腿。在开胚机的第一挡两旁，一百三十公斤重、一千一百多度高热的红钢锭，由四个工人用铁杠抬着、一个工人用钳子夹着向轧槽送，掌钳的动作稍微迟缓一点，就烤得抬杠的人心里发毛、两腿直跳，但是还得忍耐着将红钢送进轧槽后才能松口气，而下一根红钢又在催促他们。在这样的环境里，几乎没有一个人没有受过伤，工人李文炳、程元胜还被红钢烙伤了头，差一点丧了生命。在暑热天里，许多工人都受不住高温烘烤与沉重的劳动而晕倒，生产也因此显著下降。
    现在的车间主任邱方任，原是一个老轧钢工人，他一九五一年来到大冶钢厂，一看见这些情形，顿时心都紧了：“同志们这样痛苦，怎么能谈到提高生产呢！”他下定决心要依靠群众想办法减轻体力劳动。最初他建议学习鞍钢的经验，用撬杠代替四人抬红钢的操作，一天节省了三十个人工，而生产还提高了百分之二十。这个改进的成功，启发了工人，也教育了技术人员。大家都积极提出改进生产的意见。两年中，他们实现了重大的合理化建议三十多条，有运输工人邵文山制做的绞钢机，有加热炉工人周洪斌和工程师唐仁孝合作的炉门机械开关，有邱方任制做的捞钢机等等，每天可节省六十四个工人，并且使各种钢材的产量提高了一倍到三倍半。他们以超额百分之三十五完成了一九五二年的国家生产计划。
    走技术革新的道路
    他们上述的这些改进，绝大多数还限制在次要的设备上，而对轧钢机这个最主要的设备，大家总认为马达能力太小，不可能有什么改进。因此他们的生产严重地受到季节的影响，一到热天，工人们病倒的很多，生产便普遍下降，还时常受到停止生产的威胁。一九五三年夏天，干过四年轧钢工作的钳工余炳森，在工程师李邦宪帮助下，初步试制了“正围盘”，红钢从上一挡出来，便自动钻进下一挡去了。但是工人们不肯用。原因是安上“正围盘”后的产量比人工操作还低得多，大家宁肯自己多受点苦，也不能不完成国家计划。大家肯定了原来的看法：“咱们的马达能力太小，怎么能同鞍钢的工厂比！”于是把“正围盘”的建议搁置下来。
    去年五月讨论全年国家计划的时候，生产定额又比前年提高了百分之三十二，工人们普遍都有顾虑：“暑天里很难达到这个定额！”这时候，张明山创造“反围盘”的经验给他们指出了方向：走技术革新的道路。党支部和工会提出“改善操作条件，逐步走向机械化”的口号，发动全体职工提合理化建议。党支部书记亲自找余炳森谈话，动员他继续研究“正围盘”没成功的原因。工程师李邦宪也鼓励余炳森不要在困难面前低头。余炳森决心学习张明山创造“反围盘”的艰苦钻研的精神，从失败中找出成功的道路。他有空就蹲在轧钢机旁看工人操作，终于看出问题来了：人工操作是一根钢条在同一时间内只走一个轧槽，因此轧钢机可以同时轧五、六根，而“正围盘”的盘体太短，一根钢条要占两个甚至三个轧槽，反而使钢条轧的少了，如果多轧一两根，便超过马达负荷，造成跳开关事故，产量下降。他很兴奋地把这个新发现告诉了工程师李邦宪，李邦宪便立即帮助他计算出轧钢的速度，适当地将围盘盘体加长，作到一根钢条正好只走一个轧槽，便使“正围盘”最后成功，打破了原来认为马达能力太小，轧钢机不可能改进的旧看法。在这个时期内，大家还提了十多项用机械代替人力的合理化建议，先后安装了两条自动滚道，上红钢的自动小车，以及炉门机械开关等等。这样每天可节省四十八个人工，而且使冷床工的体力劳动大大减轻。在去年夏季，车间缺勤率由过去最高百分之二十五降低为百分之十六，由最低百分之十三降为百分之四，而且最初在工人们掌握新技术还不熟练的情况下，生产也维持着原有的水平，月月完成国家计划。
    一过了夏季，工人们又提出了六十多个技术革新的建议，并进一步掌握了新技术的规律，逐步提高了产量，普通钢材普遍提高百分之二十，优等钢材提高一倍多。他们又以超额一百七十多亿元（生产总值）胜利完成一九五三年的国家计划。
      发挥集体智慧，制成了
        “反立围盘”
    去年年底，大冶钢厂轧钢车间的人们，殷切地盼望将“反围盘”搞起来，但他们却拖了六个月没作成功。邱方任又从报上仔细学习了鞍钢和唐山钢厂的经验，才进一步了解到人家对于重大的技术革新，必须上下一致支持，由专业小组具体负责；而他们却只叫余炳森一人去搞。余炳森又犯了经验主义，不按图纸制作，把“反围盘”作的跟“正围盘”差不多，试验不成功还找不出原因来。有的技术人员明知道制作的不对，也不好干预。邱方任在党的支委会上作了检讨，并主张把车间技术力量（包括技术人员与老技术工人）组织起来，成立机械化专业小组，发挥集体智慧。专业小组一成立，有关改进机械设备的问题都在这个小组讨论、研究，小组作出决定后，就按决定分工负责执行，以便总结成功和失败的原因。这样一来，“反围盘”在第一次试验中便成功了。
    紧接着，见习技术员吴武彰建议学习苏联的“反立围盘”。这样可以使马达能力小而机架又少的小型轧钢机，从第二挡起全部机械化。“反立围盘”是所有围盘中最难做的一种，就大冶钢厂轧钢车间的技术水平来说，那困难就更大了。绘图没有精确的仪器，制造全凭手工，特别是如何使书上的“反立围盘”适合于他们这个设备简陋的轧钢机，更不好办。但他们从制造“反围盘”中认识到发挥集体智慧的伟大力量，仍然满怀信心地试制。
    为了使“反立围盘”试制成功，车间党的支部大会专门作出决议，号召全体职工坚决支持，并要求党员带头保证这个工作顺利进行。车间主任邱方任每次亲自主持专业小组开会研究问题，并具体分工，由见习技术员吴武彰负责绘图，工程师李邦宪负责解决技术理论问题，由机务组工人刘振忠等负责制作，余炳森负责材料供应，他自己除了全面领导这个工作外，有关车间其他部分的协同配合问题，全部由他负责。这样一来，大家的热情更加高涨。吴武彰春节中五天不休息，想了许多办法将图样赶制出来。机务组工人因为图样复杂，最初连图也看不懂，但他们经常同技术人员商量，想了许多办法，终于用手工将盘体作得合乎规格。每次试验，邱方任和专业小组的人都亲自参加安装和调整机器，寻找问题。一些没有具体任务的工人也都赶来帮忙。一发现新的问题，大家便当场讨论，及时加以解决。经过三次试验虽还没有成功，但大冶钢厂领导方面继续予以支持，批准他们停止一天生产进行试验。他们终于在二月二十七日把“反立围盘”试制成功了，当红钢顺利通过“反立围盘”进入下一个轧槽时，支部书记和一些老工人都鼓掌欢呼，那些青年工人更是兴奋得蹦跳起来。各个班长都找邱方任，要求让他们班上先试用这些新的围盘。
    现在，他们正组织工人互相交流经验，使大家能掌握使用这些围盘的规律，并解决这些新技术所引起的新问题，巩固已有的成绩；同时计划在这个基础上，进一步发动群众提合理化建议，展开以技术革新为内容的新的劳动竞赛。大冶钢厂各车间也开始积极学习他们的经验。锻造车间检查了过去的工作，建立起专业小组专门研究和处理有关生产革新的建议。炼铁车间准备立即发动群众提合理化建议，以便利用即将来到的炉子大修的机会，将他们原来全部人工操作的生产设备改为半机械化的，进一步提高劳动生产率。
