Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 12th: The Geneva Conference held its third meeting on the Indochina issue at 3:00 PM on the 12th, continuing the general debate. The general debate on the Korean issue did not take place on the 12th.

The meeting on the 12th was chaired by British Foreign Secretary Eden.

The representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Tep Phan, first announced that his government had sent an "urgent" telegram, which he did not read aloud. Tep Phan said that, according to this telegram, some people had been killed by "foreign" troops in a certain part of Cambodia.

The representative of the State of Vietnam, Nguyen Quoc Dinh, then spoke. In his speech, Nguyen Quoc Dinh distorted the history of Vietnam after World War II, attempting to defend Bao Dai's treasonous acts. However, even in this distorted account of history, Nguyen Quoc Dinh had to admit that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the truly legitimate government supported by the Vietnamese people. Another feature of Nguyen Quoc Dinh's historical account was that he completely dared not mention the fact that France violated the agreements and launched a war of aggression against the Vietnamese people.

Nguyen Quoc Dinh boasted about the "representativeness" of the Bao Dai regime, but even many newspapers in Western countries admitted that the Bao Dai regime existed only with the bayonets of the French army. Nguyen Quoc Dinh also boasted that Bao Dai had been recognized by many countries; however, in fact, many Asian countries, including India and Burma, have not yet recognized this regime.

Nguyen Quoc Dinh complained that France had not "concentrated its efforts" to intensify the Indochina War, which exposed his desire not for the restoration of peace but for the intensification of the war. He said that the French army was not invading Vietnam, but seemed to be "defending" Vietnam. Nguyen Quoc Dinh also shamelessly defended the United States' interference in Indochina affairs, portraying the United States as a "liberator." However, probably because even he himself knew it was too disgraceful, Nguyen Quoc Dinh did not dare to harp on this point.

Nguyen Quoc Dinh endlessly recited and explained the so-called "Joint Declaration" issued by France and the Bao Dai regime on April 28th. According to him, based on this declaration, Vietnam would obtain "independence," therefore, the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence was "unjustified." However, everyone knows that this "Joint Declaration" was a gesture made by France on the eve of the Geneva Conference to whitewash its colonial rule and pave the way for further American intervention in Indochina.

Nguyen Quoc Dinh finally put forward an absurd and unreasonable proposal. In this proposal, he openly demanded that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam abandon the fruits it had achieved in its eight years of struggle for independence. His slogan was "one government," "one army," and he demanded that Bao Dai's regime be extended to the whole of Vietnam. He also demanded the abolition of the Vietnamese people's armed forces that defended their national rights and the "incorporation" of the Vietnamese People's Army into the Bao Dai army. On the issue of elections, Nguyen Quoc Dinh copied the old trick used by the United States and South Korea to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, demanding that the "elections" in Vietnam be presided over by the United Nations. Nguyen Quoc Dinh put forward this proposal, which he himself knew would not be accepted, clearly had only one purpose, which was to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The Chief Representative of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, then spoke (full text to be published separately).

Zhou Enlai described the history of the Vietnamese people's opposition to colonial rule and the course of the Indochina War, as well as the various activities of the United States in interfering in the Indochina War. Zhou Enlai then pointed out that the Delegation of the People's Republic of China hoped that the conference would consider with the utmost seriousness the proposals put forward by Mr. Pham Van Dong, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This proposal truly reflected the will of the Indochinese people to fight for peace, independence, unity, and democracy, as well as their reasonable demands. In the view of the Chinese Delegation, these proposals have already opened the way for a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

Zhou Enlai finally stated that the Delegation of the People's Republic of China fully supported the statement and proposals of Mr. Pham Van Dong, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and believed that his proposals could serve as the basis for the conference to discuss the cessation of war and the restoration of peace in Indochina and to adopt appropriate resolutions.

After Zhou Enlai's speech, Eden made a brief statement on behalf of the United Kingdom government. Eden said that he did not want to "rewrite history" because, in his view, this would not lead to a consensus. He said: This will not "change our judgment and our friendship." He also said: He only wanted to "clarify the stage that the meeting seems to have reached" and raise some "practical issues." He said: "As I understand it, we have agreed that the first step should be an orderly ceasefire. If so, there are several questions that urgently need to be answered." The questions raised by Eden were: 1. "Have we agreed that all troops on both sides should be concentrated in designated areas?" 2. "Has it been agreed that Laos and Cambodia fall into a special category and that Viet Minh troops should withdraw from these two countries?" 3. "Who should determine the concentration areas in Vietnam? Should this be determined by the commanders-in-chief of both sides, and, I assume, further advice should be sought from this conference?" 4. "Do we agree that when all troops have been concentrated in designated areas, all irregular forces should be disarmed?" 5. "Do we support international supervision? If so, in what form? We (referring to the British government) support supervision by the United Nations. I would like to mention here that the five countries that recently held a meeting of prime ministers in Colombo also expressed their support at the end of their meeting for using the United Nations' good offices and its institutions to promote the goals of the Geneva Conference and to implement its resolutions on the Indochina issue. When we say the United Nations, we are not referring to the belligerent parties or any of us who must be at the conference table. A group of countries can be agreed upon, from which these United Nations member states can be selected." Eden finally hoped that the participants would find these questions "helpful" and express their opinions on them.

After a fifteen-minute break, the US representative, Smith, spoke. He denied, regardless of the facts, that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was the legitimate government of Vietnam. Smith expressed great interest in Nguyen Quoc Dinh's proposal. He said he was prepared to comment on this proposal at a later meeting. Smith emphasized supervising the ceasefire under the auspices of the United Nations. He also welcomed the questions raised by Eden.

The representative of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoung Sananikone, then spoke. He repeated what Smith had said, saying that the Bao Dai government was the only government of Vietnam. He believed that answering the questions raised by Eden would help the work of the conference.

The French representative, Bidault, then spoke. Bidault said that he could not remain indifferent to the matters mentioned in the telegram just mentioned by the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia. According to him, it seemed that this telegram could prove that someone was attempting to conquer Cambodia. He said that the representative of the Bao Dai government had just proposed that the Bao Dai government, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia should be given independence, and that this issue should be resolved immediately. But he also said that the Bao Dai government had already obtained so-called "independence." Although even the representative of the Bao Dai government had just admitted that this was still only written on paper. Bidault opposed reviewing history at the meeting, obviously because all historical facts about the Indochina issue were unfavorable to France. He said that he could not accept the fact mentioned in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech that the French people hoped that the Indochina War could be stopped like the Korean War, although anyone who had read French newspapers knew that this fact could not be overthrown. For example, the French newspaper "Combat" wrote on the same day that the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed: "Washington has negotiated with Kim Il-sung, why shouldn't Paris negotiate with Ho Chi Minh?"

The representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, then spoke (full text to be published separately). He pointed out that the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos were fighting together for national independence. Denying the existence of the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos would not solve the problem.

The representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Tep Phan, then spoke. He expressed support for the speech of the representative of the Bao Dai government, and repeated the old tune, insisting that there was no Cambodian resistance government in Cambodia. He claimed that he had an "unshirkable duty" to defend American colonialism, and he admitted that his government was under the "protection" of the United States.

His answers to the second, fourth, and fifth of the five questions raised by Eden were all "yes."

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then spoke. Molotov said that the meeting had heard many speeches on the development of Indochina. The Soviet delegation would have the opportunity to express its opinions on the views and proposals presented here. He said that the Soviet delegation believed that it would be best to talk about the speech at the beginning of the meeting, when the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia read a telegram. Since someone at the meeting wanted us to pay attention to this speech, the Soviet delegation was willing to say a few words about it.

Molotov said that although some people had seen the telegram, we had not received it, and obviously those who had seen the telegram did not pay particular attention to it. We don't know where this telegram came from, what it said, or who is responsible for the matters mentioned in the telegram. Perhaps this telegram is meaningful. In any case, it mainly indicates that someone has suffered misfortune, due to the lack of an authority trusted by the residents.

Molotov said that we came to the meeting to restore peace in Indochina. The telegram mentioned at the beginning of the meeting did not explain anything, and only indicated that the local authorities were ineffective, which had nothing to do with this meeting. Telegrams of this nature do not help the discussion of the issues.

The French representative, Bidault, then spoke. He said that he did not have the aforementioned telegram there. But he also said that the telegram mentioned so-called disturbances caused by external forces. He hoped that the meeting would confirm that this was a fact.

The representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, then spoke. He said that there were indeed foreign troops in Indochina who were invading Indochinese territory. These were the troops who came from thousands of miles away to our territory. They used the most modern weapons to massacre our people and turn our people into slaves. These were the invading troops.

The representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia took out a telegram and said that he had a telegram.

Molotov said that we have now seen the telegram, but have not read it yet. Molotov said that he had already expressed the Soviet delegation's view on the content of this telegram, and now he only wanted to express our surprise at a certain opinion expressed here. One of the participants in this meeting admitted that he had not seen the telegram, but had already drawn some conclusions from it. He said that the Soviet delegation did not want to draw any conclusions.

Bidault said that this telegram from the Kingdom of Cambodia was not addressed to the French delegation, therefore, according to him, this could prove that it was independent.

Molotov said that he believed that if someone at the meeting took out telegrams from his pocket one after another every day, which may have been fabricated according to special orders, then we may not be able to accomplish anything at this meeting. Molotov said that we should no longer be interested in certain telegrams, but should be interested in establishing peace in the region. He said that the sooner we considered this issue of rebuilding peace, the more lives we could save in this region.

The Chairman said that he was responsible for the issue of the telegram raised by the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia at the meeting. He said that he knew that the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia had a special telegram to announce, so he allowed him to bring it up. He announced that the Korean issue would be discussed on May 13th, therefore the discussion on the Indochina issue would continue on the 14th.

The meeting adjourned at 6:50 PM.

### 日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题

    日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题
    据新华社日内瓦十二日电：日内瓦会议于十二日下午三时举行关于印度支那问题的第三次会议，继续进行一般辩论。关于朝鲜问题的一般辩论十二日没有进行。
    十二日的会议由英国外交大臣艾登担任主席。
    高棉王国代表泰普潘首先宣布它的政府打来了一份“紧急”电报，他没有诵读电文。泰普潘说，根据这个电报，在高棉某地有一些人被“外来的”军队杀死。
    越南国代表阮国定接着发言。阮国定在发言中歪曲二次大战后越南的历史，企图替保大的叛国罪行辩护。然而，即使在这个对历史加以歪曲的叙述里，阮国定也不得不承认越南民主共和国是受到越南人民拥护的真正合法的政府。阮国定叙述历史的另一个特点是：他完全不敢提到法国破坏协定、对越南人民发动侵略战争的事实。
    阮国定吹嘘保大政权的“代表性”，然而连西方国家的许多报纸都承认保大政权是靠了法国军队的刺刀才存在下去的。阮国定又吹嘘保大得到了许多国家的承认，然而，事实上，包括印度、缅甸等国家在内的许多亚洲国家至今还没有承认这个政权。
    阮国定抱怨法国没有“集中力量”来加紧进行印度支那战争，这就暴露了他希望的不是恢复和平而是加紧战争。他说法国军队不是侵犯越南，而好像是“保卫”越南。阮国定还无耻地替美国干涉印度支那事务辩护，把美国说成是“解放者”。然而，大概是由于连他自己也知道太见不得人，阮国定在这方面没有敢喋喋不休。
    阮国定喋喋不休地诵读和解释法国和保大政权在四月二十八日发表的所谓“共同宣言”。据他说，根据这个宣言，越南就能得到“独立”，因此，越南人民争取民族独立的斗争是“没有理由的”。然而，谁都知道，这个“共同宣言”是法国为了在日内瓦会议前夕粉饰自己的殖民统治并为美国的进一步干涉印度支那铺平道路而作的姿态。
    阮国定最后提出了一个荒唐、无理的建议。在这个建议中，他公然要求越南民主共和国放弃自己在八年争取独立的斗争中所取得的果实。他的口号是“一个政府”、“一个军队”，他要求把保大的政权扩展到全越南，他还要求取消越南人民捍卫自己民族权利的武装，把越南人民军“编入”保大军队。在选举的问题上，阮国定抄袭了美国和南朝鲜为了阻挠朝鲜和平统一所使用的故技，要求由联合国来主持越南的“选举”。阮国定提出这个他自己也知道不会被接受的建议，显然只能有一个目的，那就是阻挠日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平的问题上达成协议。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表、外交部部长周恩来接着发言（全文另发）。
    周恩来叙述了越南人民反对殖民统治的历史和印度支那战争发生的经过以及美国干涉印度支那战争的种种活动。周恩来接着指出，中华人民共和国代表团希望会议以最严肃的态度来考虑越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同先生所提出的建议，这个建议真正表现出印度支那人民为和平、独立、统一、民主而斗争的意志和他们的合理要求。这些建议，在中国代表团看来，已经为和平解决印度支那问题开辟了道路。
    周恩来最后表示，中华人民共和国代表团完全支持越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同先生的声明和建议，并认为，他的建议可以成为本会议讨论在印度支那停止战争和恢复和平问题并通过适当决议的基础。
    在周恩来发言之后，艾登代表联合王国政府发表简短声明。艾登说，他不想“改写历史”，因为，据他看来，这样不会得出一致的意见。他说：这是不会“改变我们的判断和我们的友谊”的。他又说：他只想使“会议看起来已经达到的地步得到一些澄清”并提出一些“实际的问题”。他说：“据我了解，我们已经同意，第一步应该是有秩序地停战。如果这样，就有若干问题迫切需要答复。”艾登所提出的问题是：一、“我们是否已同意双方的一切部队均应集中在确定的地区？”二、“是否已经同意寮国和高棉属于特别的范畴，越盟军队应从这两个国家撤出？”三、“谁来规定在越南的集中地区？是否应该由双方的总指挥官来确定，并且，我假定，再向这次会议征询意见？”四、“我们是否同意，当一切军队已被集中在确定地区时，一切非正规部队均应解除武装？”五、“我们是否赞成国际监督？如果是的话，用什么形式？我们（按指英国政府）赞成由联合国来监督。我愿在这里提到，最近在科伦坡举行了总理会议的五个国家也曾在它们的会议结束时，表示赞成利用联合国的斡旋及其机构来促进日内瓦会议的目标和执行它对印度支那问题的决议。当我们说联合国的时候，我们并不是指交战方面或者必须是在会议桌上的我们之中的任何一个国家。可以协议出一批国家，从它们里面挑出这些联合国会员国来。”艾登最后希望与会者会认为这些问题是“有益的”，并对它们表示意见。
    在休息十五分钟以后，美国代表史密斯发言。他不顾事实地否认越南民主共和国政府是越南的合法政府。史密斯表示对阮国定的建议很有兴趣。他说他准备在以后的会议上再对这个建议发表意见。史密斯强调在联合国主持下监督停战。他还表示欢迎艾登所提出的问题。
    寮国王国代表冯·萨纳尼空接着发言。他重复史密斯说过的话，说什么保大政府是越南的唯一政府。他认为答复艾登所提出的问题会有助于会议的工作。
    法国代表皮杜尔接着发言。皮杜尔说，他对于刚才高棉王国代表所提到的电报中的事情不能无动于衷。据他说，好像这个电报就可以证明有人企图征服高棉。他说，刚才保大政府的代表提出应该给保大政府和寮国王国以及高棉王国以独立，这个问题应该立即解决。可是他又说保大政府已经得到所谓“独立”了。虽然连保大政府的代表刚才也承认这还只不过是写在纸上的事情。皮杜尔反对在会议上追述历史，显然因为所有关于印度支那问题的历史事实都对法国不利。他说他不能接受周恩来外长发言中所提到的法国人民希望印度支那战争也能像朝鲜战争一样停止的事实，虽然任何读过法国报纸的人都知道这个事实是推翻不了的。举个例子来说，法国“战斗报”在朝鲜停战协定签订那一天就写道：“华盛顿已与金日成谈判了，巴黎为什么不与胡志明谈判呢？”
    越南民主共和国代表范文同接着发言（全文另发）。他指出：越南、高棉、寮国三国人民共同为民族独立而斗争。否认高棉和寮国抗战政府的存在是不能解决问题的。
    高棉王国代表泰普潘接着发言。他表示支持保大政府代表的发言，并且重弹老调，硬说在高棉没有高棉抗战政府。他声称他要“义不容辞”地为美国殖民主义辩护，他承认他的政府是受到美国的“保护”的。
    他对艾登提出的五个问题中的第二、第四、第五个问题的答复都是“是的”。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接着发言。莫洛托夫说，会议已经听到过关于印度支那发展的许多发言。苏联代表团将有机会来对在这里陈述过的意见和提出过的建议发表自己的意见。他说，苏联代表团认为现在最好谈一谈会议开始时的发言，当时高棉王国的代表读了一个电报。既然会上有人要我们注意这个发言，因此苏联代表团愿意对此说几句话。
    莫洛托夫说，虽然有人见了这个电报，但是我们并没有收到这个电报，显然那些见了这个电报的人并不对这个电报特别重视。我们不知道这个电报是从哪里打来的，里面说些什么，对电报里所提到的事情谁该负责。也许这个电报是有意义的。无论如何，它主要表示有人遭受了不幸，由于没有一个得到居民信任的当局。
    莫洛托夫说，我们来开会是为了要在印度支那恢复和平。会议开始时所提到的电报没有说明任何东西，只能说明当地地方当局没有效力，这对本会议没有任何关系。这种性质的电报对讨论的问题没有任何帮助。
    法国代表皮杜尔接着发言。他说，他那里没有前面提到的那份电报。可是他又说，电报上提到有所谓外力引起的骚扰事件。他希望会议肯定这是事实。
    越南民主共和国代表范文同接着发言。他说，在印度支那的确有侵犯印度支那领土的外国军队。这是那些从几千里路以外来到我们领土上的军队。他们用最现代化的武器来屠杀我们的人民，把我们的人民变成奴隶。这些就是入侵的军队。
    高棉王国的代表拿出一份电报来说，他有一份电报。
    莫洛托夫说，我们现在看到了电报，但是还没有读过它。莫洛托夫说，对于这个电报的内容，他已经说了苏联代表团的看法，现在不过要对在这里发表过的一种意见表示我们的惊讶而已。本会议的与会者之一，自己承认没有看见过电报，但是已经从这份电报里作出了某种结论。他说，苏联代表团不想作任何结论。
    皮杜尔说，高棉王国的这个电报并不是向法国代表团提出的，因此据他说，这就可以证明它是独立的。
    莫洛托夫说，他相信如果有人在会议中每天从口袋里一个接一个地掏出可能是根据特别命令而制造出来的电报来，那末我们在这个会议上可能什么也办不成。莫洛托夫说，不应该再对某些电报有兴趣，而应该对在该地区建立和平有兴趣。他说，我们对这个重建和平的问题越快考虑，那就可以在这个地区救出更多人命。
    主席说，关于高棉王国代表在会上提出电报的问题，要由他负责。他说他知道高棉王国代表有一个特别电报要宣布，他就让他提出来了。他宣布五月十三日将讨论朝鲜问题，因此关于印度支那问题的讨论将于十四日继续举行。
    会议于六时五十分休会。
