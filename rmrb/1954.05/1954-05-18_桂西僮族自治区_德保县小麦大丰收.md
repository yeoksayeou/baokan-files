Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region

    Great Wheat Harvest in Debao County
    In Debao County, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, the average yield of wheat this spring was 105 jin per mu, an increase of more than 70% compared to last year.
    In the past, the Zhuang people did not have the habit of planting wheat. In 1951, only farmers in Ma'an, Ma'ai and other townships near the county seat planted wheat in paddy fields, and the harvest was good. By the winter of 1952, most farmers in the first and second districts had also begun to plant wheat, but because of rough farming and no fertilization, the average wheat yield last year was only 60 jin per mu. Last autumn, driven by mutual aid teams, farmers in most townships of the county planted wheat, with a planting area of more than 49,000 mu, an increase of three times compared to 1952. Farmers are also more careful in planting wheat, generally plowing and harrowing twice, and applying base fertilizer. Therefore, this year's wheat has had a bumper harvest. The wheat field of Zhao Bihao, the head of a mutual aid team, yielded only 40 jin last year, but this year it yielded 120 jin, an increase of two times compared to last year. The wheat fields of ordinary farmers have also increased by more than 70% compared to last year. The county harvested a total of more than 5.17 million jin of wheat, an increase of about seven times compared to last year. Many farmers are now planning to expand the planting area again this winter in order to strive for a greater harvest next year. (Zhu Tingyi Liu Heng)

    桂西僮族自治区
    德保县小麦大丰收
    广西省桂西僮族自治区德保县，今春小麦平均每亩产一百零五斤，比去年增产七成以上。
    过去僮族人民没有种小麦的习惯，一九五一年只有靠近县城的马安、马隘等乡农民用水田种植小麦，收成很好。到一九五二年冬，一、二区的大多数农民也都开始种植小麦，但因耕作粗糙，也不施肥，所以去年小麦每亩平均只收六十斤。去秋，在互助组的带动下，全县大部分乡的农民都种植了小麦，播种面积达四万九千多亩，比一九五二年增加了三倍。农民对小麦的种植也比较细致，一般都做到两犁两耙，并下了基肥，因此，今年的小麦获得了大丰收。互助组长赵必好的一块小麦，去年只收四十斤，今年就收了一百二十斤，比去年增加两倍。一般农民的麦田也都比去年增产七成以上。全县共收小麦五百一十七万多斤，比去年增加了约七倍。现在已有许多农民计划今冬再扩大播种面积，争取明年更大的丰收。　　　　　（朱庭义　刘珩）
