The Northeast Region has basically completed spring wheat sowing, and most areas have begun sowing field crops. This year's spring wheat sowing in the Northeast Region was generally five to ten days earlier than in previous years, and the quality of cultivation has also greatly improved. Rational close planting and seed disinfection have been widely implemented. In the southern regions where sowing was earlier, wheat seedlings have already emerged.

After the wheat sowing was completed, agricultural producers' cooperatives in various parts of the Northeast actively encouraged mutual aid teams and individual farmers to start sowing field crops. In southern Rehe Province, sowing began in late March. According to statistics from six districts in Chengde County, 700+ hectares of millet, corn, and sorghum had been sown by April 9th. In the southern part of Liaodong Province and Suizhong, Xingcheng, Jin County and other places in western Liaoning Province, sowing began in early April, and many agricultural producers' cooperatives and good mutual aid teams had mostly completed sowing millet and sorghum. In Heilongjiang Province, where the season is later, twenty-two counties had begun sowing by April 20th.

In order to better promote spring plowing, the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee recently convened a spring plowing work forum attended by cadres such as the heads of agricultural departments of various provinces and agricultural section chiefs of ten key counties. The meeting examined the main problems existing in the current spring plowing production: some areas have not yet made spring plowing the overriding central task of rural work, technical reform work has not been universally carried out, and many farmers have blindly optimistic ideas and have failed to take active action. The meeting demanded that all localities must take various measures to quickly correct shortcomings, make spring plowing production the current overriding central task of rural areas, and organize farmers to take quick action.

    东北区结束春小麦播种开始播种大田
    东北区春小麦播种基本结束，大部地区开始播种大田。今年东北区的春小麦播种，一般都比往年提前五天到十天，耕作质量也有很大提高，较普遍地实行了合理密植和种子消毒。播种较早的南部地区，麦苗已经出土。
    种麦结束后，东北各地农业生产合作社积极带动互助组和单干农民开始种大田。热河省南部于三月下旬即开始播种，据承德县六个区的统计，到四月九日就种完谷子、玉米、高粱七百多垧。辽东省南部地区和辽西省绥中、兴城、锦县等地于四月上旬开始播种，许多农业生产合作社和好的互助组的谷子、高粱已大部种完。季节较晚的黑龙江省，到四月二十日，已有二十二个县开始播种。
    为了更好地推动春耕，东北行政委员会农业局在日前召开了有各省农业厅和十个重点县的农业科长等干部参加的春耕工作座谈会，检查了当前春耕生产中存在的主要问题：部分地区尚未将春耕作为农村压倒一切的中心工作，技术改革工作尚未普遍开展起来，很多农民存在盲目乐观思想，未能积极行动起来。会议要求各地必须采取各种措施，迅速纠正缺点，把春耕生产作为当前农村压倒一切的中心任务，并组织农民迅速行动起来。
