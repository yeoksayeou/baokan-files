    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Convenes Provincial Rural Work Conference to Deploy This Year's Agricultural Production and Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial rural work conference from April 20th to 24th, focusing on discussing and deploying the tasks of agricultural production in the province for 1954. Leading cadres from the provincial, regional, and county Party committees attended the conference. At the meeting, Liu Kaiji, First Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, conveyed the spirit of the Second National Rural Work Conference of the Central Committee. Afterwards, everyone, based on the spirit of the conference, examined the current rural work in the province, especially the work situation and problems of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After examination and discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that in order to realize the country's socialist industrialization and correspondingly develop agriculture, the conference required that the province's total grain output in 1954 should increase by 7 percent on the basis of 1953, cotton should increase by 26.7 percent, and oil crops should increase by 11 percent. It also required a large increase in livestock breeding and the development of afforestation. At the same time, the conference required all levels of Party committees in the province to conduct an in-depth study of local agricultural production work without exception, earnestly tap potential strength, and formulate production targets.
    At present, there are 10,136 new and old agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shanxi Province, with member households accounting for 9.2 percent of the province's total farm households. In order to promote the substantial development of agricultural production, the conference required that Party committees at all levels generally no longer develop new cooperatives before the autumn harvest, but concentrate their efforts on consolidating existing agricultural producers' cooperatives and current production work. While consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams. Party committees at all levels should formulate plans for the development of mutual aid teams, so that the number of farm households participating in mutual aid teams in the province will increase to 60 percent of the total number of farm households on the existing basis, of which farm households participating in year-round mutual aid teams should account for more than 30 percent of the total number of farm households in the province. The conference required that Party committees at all levels adopt different technical guidance policies according to the different conditions in different regions.
    The conference also proposed that Party committees at all levels should establish and develop supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives based on the needs of the townships, and require the province to develop another 1,800 new credit cooperatives this year.
    Finally, the conference required that Party committees at all levels must strengthen the Party's leadership, improve and establish specialized institutions for the management of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation work, and effectively improve the political and ideological level and professional level of rural work cadres.

    中共山西省委召开全省农村工作会议
    布置今年全省农业生产和互助合作工作
    中共山西省委在四月二十日至二十四日召开了全省农村工作会议，着重讨论和布置一九五四年全省农业生产的任务。参加这次会议的有全省地委、县委主要负责干部。在会上省委农村工作部第一副部长刘开基传达了中央第二次全国农村工作会议精神后，大家即根据会议精神，检查全省当前农村工作，特别是农业生产和互助合作运动的工作情况和问题。经过检查和讨论后，大家一致认为：为实现国家的社会主义工业化和相应发展农业，会议要求全省一九五四年农业生产应在一九五三年的基础上使粮食总产量增产百分之七，棉花增产百分之二十六点七，油料作物增产百分之十一，并要大量繁殖牲畜和发展造林；同时要求全省各级党委必须毫无例外地迅速对当地的农业生产工作进行一次深入的研究，认真挖掘潜在力量，订出生产指标。
    目前，山西全省新老农业生产合作社已达一万零一百三十六个，入社农户占全省农户的百分之九点二。为促进农业生产的大量发展，会议要求各级党委在秋收前一般不再发展新社，要集中力量做好现有农业生产合作社的巩固工作和当前的生产工作。在巩固农业生产合作社的同时，必须加强对互助组的领导，各级党委都要订出发展互助组的计划，使全省参加互助组的农户在现有基础上发展到占全省农户总数的百分之六十，其中参加常年互助组的农户要占全省农户总数的百分之三十以上，对原有互助组要加以整顿。会议要求各级党委要根据不同地区的情况，采取不同的技术指导方针。
    会议又提出：各级党委应根据需要以乡为单位建立和发展供销合作社、信用合作社，要求全省今年再发展一千八百个新的信用合作社。
    最后会议要求各级党委必须加强党的领导，健全和建立专门管理农业生产和互助合作工作的专门机构，有效地提高农村工作干部的政治思想水平和业务水平。　　（鲁生）
