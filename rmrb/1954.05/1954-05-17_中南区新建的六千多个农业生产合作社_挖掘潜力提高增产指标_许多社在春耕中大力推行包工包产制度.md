Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th – The more than six thousand newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the Central South region are further mobilizing members to tap production potential and revise production plans through current agricultural production activities.

After the establishment of these new cooperatives, they generally formulated production plans, but most were relatively rough. The production increase targets set by some cooperatives were either too low or too high, not very realistic. Some did not fully involve members in discussions when formulating plans, causing difficulties in the execution of the plans. Therefore, most agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, in conjunction with current production activities, mobilized all members to tap production potential. Based on the different characteristics of each cooperative, and in accordance with national plans and the needs of the cooperative, they revised crop planting plans and production increase targets, and realistically stipulated specific measures to ensure the realization of the plans. In the discussion and revision of production plans by 335 agricultural production cooperatives in Xinxiang and Anyang Special Districts, Henan Province, the cotton planting area was appropriately expanded – from more than 26,000 mu last year to more than 32,000 mu, in accordance with national plans and the possible conditions of land, labor and technology in the cooperatives. At the same time, under the impetus of the agricultural production cooperatives, more than 600 mutual aid teams around them also revised their cotton planting plans, with an average increase of 13.6% over last year's cotton planting area. According to a survey of 100 agricultural production cooperatives in Ye County, 93 cooperatives have now re-examined production, specifically calculated accounts, and revised their production plans, and formulated financial budget plans. Many new cooperatives in other provinces have also revised their plans. After tapping production potential, the conservative ideas of some members have been broken, and most have appropriately increased their previously low production increase targets, while a few that had set production targets too high to guarantee completion have also been revised. The Xitian Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wenchang County, Hainan District, Guangdong Province, after tapping potential and finding shortcuts, decided to change more than five mu of paddy fields from single-cropping to double-cropping, which can increase production by at least 70 jin of rice per mu. In addition, more than 15 mu of dry land will be planted with a crop of miscellaneous grains, which can increase production by more than 18,000 jin of grain. The Songqiang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huanggang County, Hubei Province, reviewed the implementation of the production plan in the previous period, and through "comparing achievements and calculating detailed accounts," conducted a patriotic and love-the-cooperative education for all members. The members felt that the original plan was not perfect enough. In addition to reviewing and revising the original production measures such as selecting fine seeds, close planting, and improving soil, everyone also found eleven shortcuts to increase production in weeding, water management, and raising pigs and chickens. According to the revised annual plan, the income can be increased by more than 86% compared with the original plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th – The newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the Central South region are vigorously promoting various forms of the system of contracting work and output in spring plowing production. Among the more than 4,700 agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province, according to incomplete statistics, 50 cooperatives have implemented a relatively scientific system of contracting work and output, and more than 900 cooperatives have implemented a system of contracting work. Among the 70 cooperatives in Xishui County, Hubei Province, five cooperatives have implemented a system of contracting work and output, and 61 cooperatives have implemented a system of contracting work by season. Among the four new cooperatives in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, three cooperatives have adopted a method combining "piece-rate work recording" and "flexible evaluation of fixed points," and another cooperative has implemented a system of contracting work and output. Guangxi, Guangdong and other provinces are also vigorously promoting various forms of the system of contracting work from low to high levels. In order to adapt to the new form of labor organization, general cooperatives have divided production groups (or teams) according to production needs, the strength of labor within the cooperative, technical conditions, and the willingness of members, and have divided fixed or temporary cultivation areas.

Because the agricultural production cooperatives have improved and adjusted the labor organization and promoted the system of contracting work and output, most cooperatives have embarked on the track of collective operation, the phenomenon of work stoppages in production has been greatly reduced, the planning and management of production have been improved, and the production enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of members have been further strengthened.

    挖掘潜力提高增产指标
    许多社在春耕中大力推行包工包产制度
    【新华社武汉十六日电】中南区新建的六千多个农业生产合作社，正通过当前的农事生产活动进一步发动社员挖掘生产潜力，修订生产计划。
    这些新建社成立后，一般都订了生产计划，但大部分比较粗糙，有些社订的增产指标有偏低或偏高现象，不大切合实际，有的在订计划时没有发动社员进行充分讨论，造成执行计划中的困难。因此，各地大多数农业生产合作社结合当前的生产活动，发动全体社员挖掘生产潜力，根据每个社的不同特点，按照国家计划和社里需要，修订了作物种植计划和增产指标，并切合实际地规定出保证实现计划的各项具体措施。河南省新乡、安阳两个专区三百三十五个农业生产合作社在讨论修订生产计划中，按照国家计划和社里土地、人力和技术上的可能条件，适当扩大了植棉面积——由去年的两万六千多亩扩大到三万二千多亩。同时在农业生产合作社的带动下，周围六百多个互助组也纷纷修订了植棉计划，平均超过去年的植棉面积百分之十三点六。据邺县一百个农业生产合作社的调查，现在已有九十三个社经过检查生产，具体算账，重新修订了生产计划，并制定了财务预算的计划。其他各省许多新建社也都修订了计划，经过挖掘生产潜力，打破了部分社员的保守思想，大多都把过低的增产指标适当地提高了，少数原来把产量订的偏高无法保证完成的，也都作了修正。广东省海南区文昌县溪田村农业生产合作社经过挖掘潜力、找窍门，决定把五亩多水稻田由一造改为双造，每亩至少可增产七十斤稻谷，又把十五亩多旱地加种一造杂粮，能增产一万八千多斤粮食。湖北省黄冈县宋墙乡农业生产合作社检查了前一段生产计划执行情况，通过
  “比成绩、算细账”，对全体社员普遍进行了一次爱国爱社教育。社员们都感到原订计划不够完善，他们除了把原订选用良种、密植和改良土壤等生产措施进行了审查修订外，大家又在薅草、管理用水以及养猪养鸡等方面找出了十一个增产的窍门。按照修订后的全年计划，可比原订计划增加收入百分之八十六强。
    【新华社武汉十五日电】中南区新建的农业生产合作社，在春耕生产中大力推行各种形式的包工包产制度。河南省四千七百多个农业生产合作社中，据不完全统计，已有五十个社实行了较为科学的包工包产制度，有九百多个社实行了包工制。湖北省浠水县七十个社中，有五个社实行了包工包产制，六十一个社实行了按季包工制。江西省兴国县四个新建社，有三个社采用了“按件记工”和“死分活评”相结合的办法，另有一个社已实行了包工包产制。广西、广东等省也在大力推行由低级到高级等各种形式的包工制度。为了适应新的劳动力组织形式，一般的社都按生产需要、社内劳动力强弱程度、技术条件和社员的自愿，划分了生产组（或队），并划分了固定的、或临时的耕作区。
    由于农业生产合作社改进和调整了劳动组织，推行了包工包产制度，大多数的社已走上了集体经营的轨道，生产中的窝工现象大大减少，生产计划性和经营管理都改进了，社员的生产积极性和责任心也进一步加强。
