Wall Street's Ambitions

According to a March 23rd Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson stated at a press conference that the hope for victory in the Indochina War rests on the rapid training of local puppet troops. After boasting about the so-called "experience" of the U.S. in training the Syngman Rhee puppet army, Wilson lavishly praised General O'Daniel, whom they sent to Indochina as the head of the U.S. military mission, saying that O'Daniel had the "ability" to train troops. Wilson's rambling aim was to seize the right to train Indochinese puppet troops from France and replace them. Because it is known that the U.S. government had long scolded France's training of puppet troops as "simply child's play" and "making no progress," and had expressed that the U.S. "would be happy to do this work (referring to training Indochina puppet troops)."

However, everyone knows what Sima Zhao intends. France also has "experience" in this regard, repeatedly emphasizing that it has "enough fully competent officers" to carry out the training work and refusing to accept U.S. "help."

The U.S. government's scolding of France and Wilson's boasting about the U.S. itself only further expose Wall Street's ambitions!

Still Needs to be "Shocked"

On April 27th, the "Ceylon Times" of Ceylon published an editorial entitled "A New Era for Asia," attacking the U.S., saying: "Even on the eve of the historically significant and months-in-the-making Prime Ministers' Conference of the Colombo Powers (referring to India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan), Washington has taken some measures, attempting to decide the fate of this region without even consulting the independent countries in this area. Therefore, one of the most important goals of the conference opening here tomorrow is to show the West—especially the United States—that Asia will no longer allow other countries to decide."

Recently, U.S. Congressman Bolton expressed his "shock" at the hostile views of people in their "allied" countries towards the U.S. It seems that the reality in Asia can only make Bolton continue to be "shocked."

Under the Guise of "Pan-Americanism"

According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on April 3rd, on the eve of the Tenth Pan-American Conference, the U.S. "New York Times" stated:

"At this time, the United States' neighbors to the south seem not to like the United States." In fact, the fact that the United States' neighbors to the south do not "like" the United States is indeed true, and it has been around for a long time. It is by no means the casual "seem" and "at this time" as the "New York Times" describes. Ray Veek, an editor of the U.S. "Wall Street Journal" who traveled in Latin America last summer and autumn, said: Latin American countries are particularly dissatisfied with the U.S.'s double standards in trade. They believe that the U.S.'s promotion of "free enterprise" is completely hypocritical. According to the Chilean newspaper "El Mundo," the Chilean people prevented their foreign minister from going to Caracas (the capital of Venezuela, the site of the Tenth Pan-American Conference) to "take orders from the United States." Brazil's "Liberation Daily" also said, "Each Pan-American Conference makes us lose a portion of our sovereignty."

"No Right to Restrict Us"

Since Churchill delivered a speech on February 25th advocating expanding East-West trade, the U.S. rulers have felt deeply uneasy. Recently, U.S. President Eisenhower sent Churchill a private letter tactfully rebuking him, saying that Britain's proposal to reduce restrictions on East-West trade had gone too far. Then, U.S. Foreign Operations Administration Director Stassen ran to London to directly threaten: If Britain excessively pursues East-West trade opportunities, Britain will be punished with cuts in dollars (TASS dispatch from London on April 2nd).

However, this time, British public opinion did not show weakness. The "Daily Herald" immediately retorted to Britain's "ally," saying: "The United States has no right to restrict our trade," "Britain has the right to trade with anywhere it pleases."

    美国和它的“朋友”
    华尔街的野心
    据法新社华盛顿三月二十三日电讯报道，美国国防部长威尔逊在一次记者招待会上说：印度支那战争胜利的希望，寄托在迅速训练当地伪军方面。威尔逊在吹了一通美国训练李承晚伪军的所谓“经验”之后，又把他们送到印度支那去做美国军事代表团团长的奥丹尼尔着实地夸奖了一番，并说奥丹尼尔是有训练军队工作“能力”的。威尔逊囉囌了一阵，目的就是想取法国对印度支那伪军的训练权而代之。因为人们知道，美国政府早就责骂法国对伪军的训练工作“简直是儿戏”和“毫无进展了”，而且表示过，美国“将乐于做这件工作（指训练印度支那伪军）”。
    但是，司马昭之心路人皆知，法国在这一点上也是有“经验”的，他一再强调自己有“足够完全能胜任的军官”来进行训练工作，拒绝接受美国的“帮助”。
    美国政府对法国的责骂和威尔逊对美国自己的吹嘘，只是进一步暴露了华尔街的野心吧了！
      还要“震惊”下去
    四月二十七日，锡兰的“锡兰时报”以“亚洲的新纪元”为题，发表社论抨击美国说：“甚至在具有历史意义的、筹备了好几个月的东方五国（指印度、印尼、缅甸、锡兰和巴基斯坦）总理会议的前夕，华盛顿还采取了一些措施，甚至不和这个地区的独立国磋商，就企图决定这个地区的命运。因此，明天在这里开幕的会议的一个最重要目标就是向西方——特别是向美国——表明，亚洲将不再让其他国家来决定了”。
    最近，美国众议员波尔顿曾为他们的“盟国”人士对美国的仇视看法而感到“震惊”。现在看来，亚洲的现实只有使波尔顿继续“震惊”下去了。
      在“泛美主义”幌子下
    据塔斯社莫斯科四月三日电讯报道，在第十届泛美会议召开的前夕，美国“纽约时报”曾说：
  “在这个时候，美国南面的邻国好像都不喜欢美国似的”。其实美国南面的邻国之不“喜欢”美国是确确实实的，而且是由来已久了，决不像“纽约时报”轻描淡写的“好像”和“在这个时候”。去年夏秋间，在拉丁美洲旅行的美国“华尔街日报”编辑雷·维克曾说：拉丁美洲国家对美国在贸易上的口是心非特别不满，它们认为美国对“自由企业”的宣传完全是伪善的。据智利“世界报”的记载，智利群众曾阻止他们的外交部长到加拉加斯（委内瑞拉首都，第十届泛美会议所在地）去“听命美国的指挥”。巴西的“解放报”也说“每一届泛美会议都使我们丧失一部分主权”。
      “没有权利限制我们”
    自从邱吉尔在二月二十五日发表演说，主张扩大东西贸易以后，美国统治者们大感不安。最近，美国总统艾森豪威尔曾给邱吉尔一封私人信委婉地责备说：英国对减少东西方贸易限制的建议，做得太过火了。接着，美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生跑到伦敦直接威胁起来：如果英国过分追求东西贸易机会的话，英国就要受到削减美元的惩罚（塔斯社伦敦四月二日电）。
    可是，这一次，英国舆论却没有示弱，“每日先驱报”马上就回敬了英国的“盟友”说：“美国没有权利限制我们的贸易”，“英国有权任意与任何地方进行贸易。”
