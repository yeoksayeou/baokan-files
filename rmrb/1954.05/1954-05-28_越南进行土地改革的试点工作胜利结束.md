    越南进行土地改革的试点工作胜利结束
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南“救国报”报道：自去年十二月二十一日起，在北越太原省岱慈县的雄山、平顺、新泰、独立、尘富、安美等六个乡进行的土地改革试点工作，已在今年三月二十一日胜利结束，取得了重大的收获。
    在这六个乡的试点工作中，已经完全废除了地主阶级的土地所有制和封建剥削关系。六个乡的农民共分得耕地二千五百二十九亩多，耕牛三百四十三头，各种农具五百六十件，谷子三万六千四百六十六斤，房屋三十二间。分到土地的农民共有一千六百五十五户，共六千一百六十九人。
    经过土地改革后，农民的阶级觉悟有了进一步的提高。各乡的组织也经过整顿，将暗藏在越南劳动党和政府等基层组织中的坏分子驱逐出去；一些坚决斗争的贫雇农被吸收到党和政府的基层组织中。经过土地改革后，在六个乡中共发展了七十名贫雇农为劳动党党员。青年、妇女等群众组织也日益巩固。
