The Central Higher Education Ministry and the Education Ministry issued the "Decision on Changing Leadership Relations of Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools," transferring the educational work of Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools nationwide from the leadership of the Central Higher Education Ministry to the unified leadership of the Central Education Ministry. At the same time, the "Regulations on Leadership Relations of Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools" issued by the Central Higher Education Ministry and the Education Ministry in November 1953 were abolished. This change in leadership relations is mainly due to the nature of Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School education belonging to the scope of general education, and to meet the needs of future development, and to facilitate strengthening teaching leadership and improving teaching quality. The decision pointed out that all construction plans, financial plans, teaching plans, teaching outlines, and other important regulations, instructions, or orders related to Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools nationwide issued by the Central Education Ministry should be implemented by all Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools and institutions of higher learning with attached Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools. If it is necessary to make flexible arrangements, it must be reported to the Central Education Ministry for approval. The education bureaus of the administrative committees of the greater administrative areas and the education departments (bureaus) of the people's governments of each province (city) should inspect, supervise, and guide the work of local Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools, and regularly summarize and report to the Central Education Ministry. Institutions of higher learning with attached Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools should also accept the inspection, supervision, and guidance of the local educational administrative departments, and implement the local systems and regulations related to Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School education formulated by the local educational administrative departments. The decision stipulated that the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools attached to institutions of higher learning in various places should be directly managed by the respective institutions of higher learning and should be regarded as an important measure for institutions of higher learning to increase the proportion of workers and peasants, and must be effectively and responsibly managed. Each institution of higher learning should be responsible for handling the general administrative work and teaching work of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School, and should report to the education department (bureau) of the province (city) where it is located for instructions. Major issues can also be reported to the Greater Administrative Area Higher Education Bureau or the Central Higher Education Ministry for resolution. The decision also stipulated that the faculty required for Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools (including those attached to institutions of higher learning) should be uniformly allocated and resolved by the education bureaus of the greater administrative areas and the education departments (bureaus) of the provinces (cities) from among the graduates of institutions of higher learning and the existing faculty of the secondary schools under their jurisdiction. When allocating secondary school faculty, the education bureaus of the greater administrative areas and the education departments (bureaus) of the provinces (cities) should first meet the needs of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools and ensure their quantity and quality. Institutions of higher learning should also try their best to tap their potential and transfer those within the school who are suitable to be secondary school teachers to the attached Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools to serve as full-time or part-time teachers. The power to transfer faculty for Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools nationwide (excluding those self-allocated by institutions of higher learning) shall be vested in the education bureaus of the greater administrative areas and the education departments (bureaus) of the provinces (cities). The enrollment work of Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools shall be uniformly organized and led by the education bureaus and higher education bureaus of the greater administrative areas or the education departments (bureaus) of the provinces (cities). Relevant enrollment matters shall be reported by the education bureaus of the greater administrative areas to the Central Education Ministry for instructions.

    关于改变工农速成中学领导关系的决定
    中央人民政府高等教育部和教育部颁发了“关于改变工农速成中学领导关系的决定”，将全国工农速成中学教育事业由中央高等教育部改归中央教育部统一领导，同时废止一九五三年十一月中央高等教育部、教育部所颁发的“关于工农速成中学领导关系的规定”。这次领导关系的改变，主要是由于工农速成中学教育的性质属于普通教育的范围，和适应今后发展的需要，并便于加强教学领导，以提高教学质量。决定中指出，凡中央教育部所颁发的有关全国工农速成中学的建设计划、财务计划、教学计划、教学大纲及其他重要法规、指示或命令，全国工农速成中学和附设工农速成中学的高等学校都应执行，如有必要变通办理时，须报告中央教育部批准。各大区行政委员会教育局和各省
  （市）人民政府教育厅（局）应检查、监督和指导当地工农速成中学的工作，并定期总结，报告中央教育部。附设工农速成中学的高等学校，也应接受所在地区教育行政部门的检查、监督和指导，并执行当地教育行政部门所制订的地方性的有关工农速成中学教育的制度和规定。决定中规定，各地高等学校附设的工农速成中学，由各该高等学校直接管理，并应视为高等学校增加工农成分的重要措施，必须切实负责办好。各高等学校应负责处理工农速成中学的一般行政工作和教学工作，并应向所在的省（市）教育厅（局）请示报告，重大问题可同时报请大区高等教育局或中央高等教育部解决。决定中还规定，关于工农速成中学（包括高等学校附设的工农速成中学）所需师资，由学校所在地的大区教育局及省（市）教育厅（局）负责在其所分配到的高等学校毕业生及所属各中等学校现有师资内统一调配解决。各大区教育局和各省（市）教育厅
  （局）在调配中等学校师资时，首先应满足工农速成中学的需要，并保证其数量和质量。各高等学校亦应尽量发掘潜力，将校内适于做中等学校师资者调到附设的工农速成中学担任专职或兼职教师。全国工农速成中学师资（高等学校自行调配的除外）的调动权统归大区教育局和省（市）教育厅（局）。工农速成中学的招生工作，由大区教育局和高等教育局或省（市）教育厅（局）统一组织领导。有关招生事项，由大区教育局向中央教育部请示报告。
