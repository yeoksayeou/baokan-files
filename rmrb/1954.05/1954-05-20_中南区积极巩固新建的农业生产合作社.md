The Central South Region has newly established 6,245 agricultural producers' cooperatives, exceeding the planned establishment target set last winter by 149 percent. More than 115,000 farming households have joined. Including the original old cooperatives, the region now has 7,177 agricultural producers' cooperatives, with more than 135,000 farming households participating, accounting for 0.35 percent of the total farming households in the region. There are thirteen large cooperatives with more than 100 households each, and ninety-five large cooperatives with fifty to one hundred households each.

Throughout the region, the newly established cooperatives are all focusing on improving production as the central link in consolidating the cooperatives. Under the requirement of increasing production, many cooperatives in various regions are actively carrying out basic agricultural construction and reforming production techniques. Since the beginning of spring, the 209 cooperatives in Shangrao Special District, Jiangxi Province, have built 593 dams, dikes, and ponds, benefiting more than 20,000 mu of farmland. More than 1,100 mu of single-season rice fields have been converted to double-season, and 490 mu of "intercropping" have been converted to "continuous cropping." Cooperatives in various regions have also collected and manufactured large quantities of natural fertilizers, thereby increasing the fertility of the fields and reducing investment in agricultural production. According to a survey of twenty cooperatives in Hubei Province: commercial fertilizers have decreased by 36 percent compared to last year, and natural fertilizers have increased by more than 140 percent compared to last year. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have also appropriately carried out deep plowing, close planting, soil improvement, increased fertilizer application, seed selection, and suitable seedbeds. In addition, production plans have been revised, and the contracting system has been implemented. All of these have laid a certain material foundation for this year's increased production. In cooperatives with Party and Youth League organizations, the Party and Youth League branches are strengthening the political and ideological work of the cooperatives to promote the production enthusiasm of the members. In the Xingfu Cooperative in Jingjiang County, Hubei Province, Party and Youth League members are assigned to understand the ideological situation of the members. When they discovered that a middle peasant, Dai Yushu, was afraid of suffering losses and wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, they mobilized his confidant, Li Hanying, to educate him by recalling the past and comparing it to the present, explaining the road to common prosperity. After being educated, he was determined to improve the cooperative's production. The Party branch of the Jianshe Cooperative in Jiangling County discovered that Han Mingqing had concerns about increasing production within the cooperative, and immediately adopted the method of calculating detailed accounts of increased production to dispel his concerns, enabling him to actively participate in production.

Currently, in addition to concentrating efforts on consolidating existing cooperatives, the entire region is preparing to develop and consolidate mutual aid teams after the autumn harvest, and at the same time, it is planning to select good year-round mutual aid teams as targets for conversion to cooperatives; and is stepping up the training of backbone personnel for running cooperatives.

    中南区积极巩固新建的农业生产合作社
    中南区新建立的农业生产合作社已达六千二百四十五个，超过去冬原订建社计划百分之一百四十九，参加农户有十一万五千多户。加上原有的老社，全区已有农业生产合作社七千一百七十七个，参加农户有十三万五千多户，占全区总农户百分之零点三五。全区百户以上的大社有十三个，五十户到一百户的大社有九十五个。
    全区新建社都以搞好生产作为巩固社的中心环节。许多地区的社在提高生产的要求下，积极进行农业生产的基本建设和生产技术改革。江西省上饶专区的二百零九个社，入春以来，修水坝、水堤、水塘等五百九十三座，受益田地二万多亩。水稻一季改双季的有一千一百多亩，“间作”改“连作”的有四百九十亩。各地区的社还大量地收集和制造自然肥料，从而增加田地的肥效，减少农业生产投资。湖北省据二十个社的调查：商品肥料比去年减少了百分之三十六，自然肥料比去年增加了百分之一百四十以上。各地农业社还适当地进行了深耕、密植、改良土壤、增施肥料、选种、合式秧田等。此外，还修订了生产计划，推行了包工制。这些都为今年增产打下一定的物质基础。在有党团组织的社里，党团支部都以加强社的政治思想工作来推动社员生产积极性。湖北省荆江县幸福社，党团员分工包干了解社员思想情况。他们发现中农戴玉书怕吃亏想退社时，就动员他的知心人李汉英给他进行回忆对比的教育，讲清共同富裕的道路。经过教育，他决心把社的生产搞好。江陵县建设社的党支部发现韩明清对社内增产有顾虑，随即采取算增产细账的办法，解除了他的顾虑，使他积极投入生产。
    目前全区除集中力量巩固现有社外，并准备在秋后发展和巩固互助组，同时有计划地挑选好的常年互助组为转社对象；加紧训练办社的骨干。
