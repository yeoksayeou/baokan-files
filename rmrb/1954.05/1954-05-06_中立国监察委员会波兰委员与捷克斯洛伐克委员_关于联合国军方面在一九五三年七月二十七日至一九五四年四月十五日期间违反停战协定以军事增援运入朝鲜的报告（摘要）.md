Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 5th. The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) submitted to the Military Armistice Commission on April 30th a "Report Regarding the UN Command's Introduction of Military Reinforcements into Korea in Violation of the Armistice Agreement Between July 27, 1953, and April 15, 1954." This report systematically describes for the first time the facts of the US side violating the armistice agreement, deceiving and misleading the NNSC in transporting military reinforcements into Korea since the Korean armistice. It has aroused great attention in Kaesong.

The report points out in the first part: The task of the NNSC is to supervise the two parties to the armistice agreement to prevent the introduction of military reinforcements during the armistice, in order to ensure the stability of the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

However, based solely on the materials available to the NNSC, which has been subject to various restrictions and obstructions by the UN Command, "the facts are already very clear that the UN Command is violating the armistice agreement by introducing military reinforcements... On the other hand, the supervision and inspection carried out by the NNSC and its neutral inspection teams show that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have consistently strictly abided by the provisions of the armistice agreement."

The second part of the report cites several relevant reports, materials, and statistics from the NNSC's archives to illustrate the UN Command's violations of the armistice agreement.

The report states: "Since the armistice, the UN Command has not transported combat materials in accordance with the 'one-for-one replacement of the same performance and type' provision." Taking combat aircraft as an example, during the eight-month period from August 1953 to March 1954, the UN Command successively transported fifteen types of combat aircraft into Korea in excess of the provisions of the armistice agreement. These types of aircraft were the main types of combat aircraft used on the Korean battlefield. According to statistics at the end of March 1954, the UN Command had transported a surplus of ninety-seven aircraft of various types.

The UN Command, disregarding the agreement on the definition of combat aircraft reached on the Military Armistice Commission in which it personally participated, "unilaterally claimed that certain types of combat aircraft were not combat aircraft and refused to report their entry into Korea." The number of combat aircraft transported into Korea by the UN Command that it refused to report but were discovered by the neutral inspection teams amounted to 177 as of April 15, 1954.

The report also states: "The neutral inspection teams even discovered that the UN Command had combat aircraft entering Korea outside the designated ports of entry." For example, the neutral inspection team stationed in Daegu discovered after investigation that the UN Command's combat aircraft VB-17, serial number 48-3798, entered Korea outside the designated ports of entry between December 1953 and January 1954, which is a serious violation of the provisions of the armistice agreement.

The report points out: In order to ensure that no reinforcing combat materials are introduced, the NNSC has made a resolution instructing "neutral inspection teams to carry out supervision and inspection of the parts and components of combat materials." However, to date, the UN Command still refuses to allow the NNSC and its neutral inspection teams to conduct supervision and inspection of these parts, components, and disassembled parts. It must be pointed out that on October 12, 1953, when the UN Command accused the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers of allegedly transporting reinforcing combat aircraft in boxes, it stated that transporting combat materials in the form of parts, components, and disassembled parts was a violation of the armistice agreement, and therefore requested an investigation. Although the results of the investigation proved that the accusations were groundless and no violations of the armistice agreement had occurred, this shows that the UN Command considers the parts, components, and disassembled parts of combat materials to be combat materials."

As of the end of February 1954, based solely on the very incomplete materials available to the NNSC, the UN Command had already transported a large number of combat material parts, components, and disassembled parts without the supervision and inspection of the NNSC. These could be assembled into at least: 465 cannons and howitzers of various calibers, 1,365 machine guns of various calibers, 6,400 rocket launchers of various calibers, and 145 mortars of various calibers. The incident in which the neutral inspection team stationed in Busan discovered that the UN Command had transported 106 mortars into Busan port confirmed that the UN Command was actually using this excuse to transport reinforcing combat materials. The UN Command did not report the entry of these weapons to the NNSC and its neutral inspection teams. The neutral inspection team only accidentally and unexpectedly discovered many suspicious boxes in other cargo piles. Upon the insistence of the team members, the boxes were opened, and disassembled parts of brand new mortars were found. Further investigation confirmed that these weapons were 106 complete and brand new 4.2-inch caliber mortars packed in 318 boxes, with each complete mortar packed in three boxes.

The report states: The UN Command uses various methods to transport reinforcing combat materials. In addition to the above-mentioned method of breaking them into smaller parts, it also uses the method of reporting whole numbers as zero when transporting out replaced combat materials. For example, on February 1, 1954, the UN Command notified that 12 4.2-inch caliber mortars, 9 81mm mortars, and 2,700 rifles would be transported out of Korea via Busan for replacement purposes. However, the neutral inspection team's inspection revealed that only some scattered small parts of these weapons were transported out. However, the important components of these weapons were retained in South Korea. But when they transported in replacements for these weapons, they were fully assembled. For example, when the UN Command transported out armored vehicles for replacement, it was often clearly seen that most of the weapons on the armored vehicles had been dismantled and left in Korea, while the armored vehicles that the UN Command transported into Korea for replacement were all fully equipped with weapons. As of March 17, 1954, according to the inspection results of the neutral inspection team members, the UN Command had removed approximately 300 machine guns and 15 mortars from the armored vehicles that were transported out. The UN Command used this method of reporting whole numbers as zero when transporting out replaced materials to transport a large number of military reinforcements into South Korea.

The report states: "What the neutral inspection teams found more frequently was that the UN Command reported less when transporting in and reported more when transporting out." For example, in September 1953, the UN Command reported that 249 combat aircraft had entered Korea, while based solely on the very incomplete supervision and inspection results of the neutral inspection teams under the various restrictions and obstructions of the UN Command, 435 combat aircraft were transported in by the UN Command in that month. That is, in just one month, the UN Command illegally transported 186 combat aircraft. Regarding reporting more when transporting out, the UN Command's transport of armored vehicles in October 1953 can be cited as an example. In October 1953, the UN Command reported to the NNSC that a total of 145 landing vehicles were transported out, while the neutral inspection team found that only 74 landing vehicles were actually transported out, a difference of 71 vehicles. The UN Command's use of this method of reporting more when transporting out combat materials created the possibility of transporting in military reinforcements.

The report also states: In addition, another aspect related to the UN Command's transport of combat materials should also be pointed out here. In the five months from October 1953 to February 1954, the UN Command reported to the NNSC and the Military Armistice Commission that approximately 130 million rounds of ammunition of various calibers and approximately 1.1 million rounds of artillery shells of various calibers were destroyed or consumed. The UN Command could therefore transport in the same quantity of ammunition and artillery shells of the same caliber, and has already transported in a considerable quantity of ammunition and artillery shells accordingly. This quantity of ammunition, if 100 rounds are issued per person, can supply 1.3 million soldiers using small arms. This quantity of artillery shells, if used to supply 1,000 cannons, would allow each cannon to receive an average of more than 1,000 rounds. "It is inconceivable that the quantity of ammunition destroyed or consumed by the UN Command during the armistice would be so enormous."

The report states in the third part: "The situation is even more serious because the UN Command, while violating the armistice agreement by reinforcing its military forces, restricts and obstructs the work of the neutral inspection teams stationed at ports of entry within the areas it controls in various ways. Due to the restrictions and obstructions of the UN Command, the NNSC can only fully perform its duties in the areas controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, while the work of its neutral inspection teams stationed in the areas controlled by the UN Command has been severely obstructed, and it is practically impossible to conduct proper and effective supervision and inspection of the UN Command's rotations and replacements... The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC believe that it is necessary to demand that the UN Command immediately cease its violations of the armistice agreement by introducing military reinforcements and immediately cease its restrictions and obstructions on the NNSC and its neutral inspection teams. The UN Command should take effective measures to enable the NNSC to perform its legitimate duties in accordance with the armistice agreement in the areas controlled by the UN Command, in order to ensure the stability of the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

    关于联合国军方面在一九五三年七月二十七日至一九五四年四月十五日期间违反停战协定以军事增援运入朝鲜的报告（摘要）
    【新华社开城五日电】中立国监察委员会波兰委员与捷克斯洛伐克委员在四月三十日送给军事停战委员会一个“关于联合国军方面在一九五三年七月二十七日至一九五四年四月十五日期间违反停战协定以军事增援运入朝鲜的报告”。这个报告第一次系统地叙述了从朝鲜停战以来美方违反停战协定、蒙蔽和欺骗中立国监察委员会运进军事增援的事实，在开城已引起了极大的注意。
    报告在第一部分中指出：中立国监察委员会的任务，就是要监督停战协定缔约双方在停战期间不运进军事增援，以保证朝鲜停战的稳定，并有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    但是，仅仅根据中立国监察委员会在受到联合国军方面种种限制与阻挠的情况下所掌握的材料看来，“事实已经很清楚，联合国军方面正在违反停战协定运入军事增援……在另一方面，根据中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组所进行的监督与视察显示，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面一贯严守停战协定的规定。”
    报告的第二部分，举出了中立国监察委员会档案中的若干有关报告、材料和统计，说明联合国军方面违反停战协定的行为。
    报告说：“联合国军方面自停战以来，就不按照‘同样性能同样类型的一件换一件’的规定运入作战物资。”以作战飞机为例，自一九五三年八月至一九五四年三月的八个月的期间，联合国军方面先后就有十五种类型的作战飞机违反停战协定的规定超额运进朝鲜。这些类型的飞机都是朝鲜战场上所使用的主要类型的作战飞机。根据一九五四年三月底的统计，联合国军方面超额运进各种类型的作战飞机即达九十七架。
    联合国军方面不顾其本方所亲自参加在军事停战委员会上达成的关于作战飞机定义的协议，“片面声称某些类型的作战飞机不是作战飞机，而拒绝报告其进入朝鲜”。联合国军方面这种拒不报告、而被中立国视察小组发现的运进朝鲜的作战飞机，截至一九五四年四月十五日止，为数达一百七十七架。
    报告又说：“中立国视察小组甚至曾经发现联合国军方面曾有作战飞机在指定的口岸以外进入朝鲜”。例如，驻大邱的中立国视察小组曾在调查后，发现联合国军方面的作战飞机VB—17，编号48—3798，在一九五三年十二月和一九五四年一月间在指定的口岸以外进入朝鲜，这是严重违反停战协定的规定的。
    报告指出：为了确保不运入增援的作战物资，中立国监察委员会曾经作出决议，指示“中立国视察小组就作战物资的散件、零件执行监察和视察。但是截至现在为止，联合国军方面仍然拒绝让中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组对这些散件、拆散件、零件等进行监察和视察。必须指出，一九五三年十月十二日联合国军方面向中立国监察委员会指控朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面据称装箱运进增援的作战飞机时，曾表示以散件、拆散件和零件的方式运进作战物资是违反停战协定的，因此要求进行调查，虽然调查的结果证明那次指控的内容毫无根据，并无违反停战协定的事件发生，但这表明了联合国军方面认为作战物资的散件、拆散件和零件就是作战物资”。
    截至一九五四年二月底止，仅仅根据中立国监察委员会所掌握的很不完全的材料，联合国军方面就已经不受中立国监察委员会的监察和视察运进了大量的作战物资散件、拆散件和零件，它们至少可以装配成：各种口径的炮和榴弹炮四百六十五门，各种口径的机关枪一千三百六十五挺，各种口径的火箭炮六千四百门，各种口径的迫击炮一百四十五门。驻釜山中立国视察小组所发现的联合国军方面运进一百零六门迫击炮进入釜山港口的事件，证实了联合国军方面实际就在利用这个借口运进增援的作战物资。联合国军方面根本未向中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组报告这批武器的运进。中立国视察小组只是偶然地、意外地在其它货物堆里发现了许多可疑的箱子，在小组人员坚持之下打开了箱子，发现是全新的迫击炮拆散件，进一步调查证实这些武器是一百零六门全套和全新的四点二英寸口径的迫击炮分装在三百一十八个箱子里，每一门全套的迫击炮分装在三个箱子里。
    报告说：联合国军方面运进增援的作战物资的方式是多样的，除了上述化整为零的方式，还有在运出被替换作战物资时采用以零报整的方式。例如，一九五四年二月一日，联合国军方面通知将有十二门四点二英寸口径迫击炮、九门八十一公厘迫击炮和二千七百枝步枪为替换目的而经由釜山运出朝鲜，但中立国视察小组视察结果，是这些武器的
  一些零星小件运出。但这些武器的重要机件却被保留在南朝鲜。但他们运进这些武器的替换品时却是装配完全的。又如当联合国军方面为了替换而运出装甲车辆时经常显著地看出装甲车辆上的武器大多数已被拆除下来留在朝鲜，而联合国军方面由于替换而运进朝鲜的装甲车辆却都是武器装备齐全的，截至一九五四年三月十七日止，根据中立国视察小组人员视察的结果，联合国军方面从运出的装甲车辆上，曾经拆下大约三百挺机关枪和十五门迫击炮。联合国军就用这种以零报整运出被替换物资的方法，大量向南朝鲜运进了军事增援。
    报告说：“中立国视察小组所更经常发现的联合国军方面运进增援的作战物资的方式是：运进时以多报少，运出时以少报多。”例如一九五三年九月联合国军方面报告了二百四十九架作战飞机进入朝鲜，而仅仅根据中立国视察小组在联合国军方面的种种限制与阻挠之下的极不完全的监察和视察的结果，在该月份联合国军方面运进的作战飞机就有四百三十五架。即仅仅在一个月内，联合国军方面就非法运进作战飞机达一百八十六架。运出时以少报多，可以举联合国军方面一九五三年十月运出装甲车辆为例。在一九五三年十月联合国军方面向中立国监察委员会报告运出登陆车共一百四十五辆，而中立国视察小组查出实际运出的登陆车仅为七十四辆，相差达七十一辆。联合国军方面所采用的这种在运出作战物资时以少报多的方式，造成了运进军事增援的可能。
    报告又说：此外与联合国军方面运进作战物资有关的另一方面的情况也应该在此指出，自一九五三年十月至一九五四年二月的五个月里，联合国军方面共向中立国监察委员会和军事停战委员会报告了毁坏耗损的各种口径的枪弹约一亿三千万发，各种口径的炮弹约一百一十万发，联合国军将可据此运入同等数量的同口径枪弹和炮弹，并且已经据此运入了相当数量的枪弹和炮弹。这一数量的枪弹，如以每人发给一百发计，可以供给一百三十万个使用轻武器的士兵。这一数量的炮弹，如果用以供给
  一千门炮使用，平均每一门炮可以获得炮弹一千余发。“联合国军方面在停战期间毁坏耗损的弹药的数量会如此巨大是不可思议的”。
    报告在第三部分中说：“由于联合国军方面在违反停战协定进行军事力量的增援的同时，以各种方式限制与阻挠驻在它所控制的区域以内各口岸的中立国视察小组的工作，情况就更为严重。由于联合国军方面的限制和阻挠，中立国监察委员会只能在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军控制下的地区内充分执行其职司，而其驻在联合国军控制地区的中立国视察小组的工作上已受到严重的阻挠，实际上无法进行对于联合国军方面的轮换与替换的正当而有效的监察和视察。……中立国监察委员会波兰委员与捷克斯洛伐克委员认为有必要要求联合国军方面立即停止其进入军事增援的违反停战协定的行为，立即停止对于中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组的限制和阻挠。联合国军方面应采取有效措施，使中立国监察委员会得以在联合国军控制的地区内，根据停战协定来执行其合法职司，以保证朝鲜停战的稳定并有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决。”
