Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army units, following the instructions of the Volunteer Army leadership, are systematically assisting the Korean people in rebuilding their homes.

Thanks to the efforts of the Korean people and the Volunteer Army units, many areas in northern Korea near the battle zone have seen the construction of new villages, transforming the desolate wartime landscape. In the Kimhwa area, Volunteer Army units constructed over 1,400 houses for the local people in just over twenty days. A unit of the Volunteer Army on the central front helped the people of Sutaeri village in Changdo County, who had returned to their homes, build over 300 houses in seven days. Commanders and soldiers of this unit also provided their saved rations to the local people in need of food. A certain Volunteer Army company, which was awarded a collective first-class merit, repaired a two-story building with seven large classrooms and eight faculty dormitories for the Gohara High School. After fifty-five days of intense labor, a Volunteer Army unit stationed in Hoeyang County helped local people build an auditorium that could accommodate over 1,200 people. This auditorium was even larger than the original auditorium in Hoeyang County before the war.

Many Volunteer Army units also helped the Korean people repair water conservancy facilities damaged by the enemy during the war. The Tzamho Reservoir, one of the famous reservoirs on the west coast of Korea, was bombed by American air pirates in May last year, causing severe floods for the nearby people. At that time, Korean and Chinese troops braved enemy bombing and strafing to quickly repair the breach caused by enemy aircraft. In April this year, a Volunteer Army unit also helped local residents reopen a 440-meter-long river channel downstream of the reservoir, and re-excavated and renovated two long dikes and fourteen dams within the reservoir system, totaling more than 45,700 meters in length. In the Kaesong area, a Volunteer Army unit also built ninety river embankments, more than one hundred and twenty dams, and many drainage ditches for the local people. In over twenty days, a Volunteer Army unit on the east front helped the residents of their station build more than 12,000 meters of canals; another unit also helped local residents repair the canals destroyed by the US-Rhee bandit troops, turning 5,000 acres of dry land into paddy fields.

While vigilantly guarding the coast, Volunteer Army coastal defense units on the east and west coasts of Korea also help Korean fishermen repair fishing boats and mend fishing nets. A certain Volunteer Army unit on the east coast specifically established a blacksmith shop to forge more than 1,200 nails for repairing fishing boats for four nearby fishery production cooperatives. They also repaired more than 800 other tools. This unit also upgraded the 6,000-meter-long road near the fishing port into a highway, enabling fishermen to quickly transport the fresh fish they caught by car to the nearby railway station. Under the protection and assistance of the Volunteer Army and the efforts of the fishermen, the fishermen have continuously achieved bumper harvests. A certain fishery production cooperative exceeded its production target for March by 50%. Fishing expert Lu Jingwen, who was awarded the third-class National Flag Medal, led a fishing boat that completed 350% of its production plan in the past three months.

    志愿军各部队努力帮助朝鲜人民重建家园
    【新华社平壤七日电】中国人民志愿军各部队根据志愿军领导机关的指示，正在有计划地帮助朝鲜人民进行重建家园的工作。
    在朝鲜人民和志愿军部队的努力下，朝鲜北部接近战区的许多地方，已经修建起新的村庄，改变了战时的荒凉景象。金城地区的志愿军部队在二十多天的时间内就帮助当地人民修建了一千四百多间房屋。中线志愿军某部在七天内帮助重返家园的昌道郡水泰里人民修建了三百多幢房屋。这支部队的指挥员、战斗员还将他们节约下来的粮食救济了当地缺粮的人民。曾经荣获集体一等功的志愿军某连，为高原中学修好了一座有七间大教室的二层楼房和八间教职员宿舍。驻在淮阳郡的志愿军某部经过五十五天紧张的劳动，帮助当地人民盖起了一座能容一千二百多人的大礼堂。这座礼堂比战前淮阳郡原有的礼堂还大。
    志愿军许多部队还帮助朝鲜人民修复了在战争中被敌人破坏的水利建筑。朝鲜西海岸著名的贮水池之一慈母贮水池，去年五月曾被美国空中强盗炸毁，使附近人民遭受了严重的水灾。当时朝中部队曾冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，迅速修复了被敌机炸开的缺口。今年四月，志愿军某部又帮助当地居民在贮水池下游重新开辟了一条长达四百四十公尺的河道，并重挖和整修了贮水池系统内的两道长堤和十四道水坝，总长共四万五千七百多公尺。开城地区的志愿军某部也为当地人民修建了九十条河堤、一百二十多道水坝和许多排水沟。东线志愿军某部在二十多天内帮助驻地人民修建了一万二千多公尺长的水渠；另一支部队也帮助当地居民修复了被美李匪军破坏的水渠，使五千亩旱田变成了水田。
    在朝鲜东、西海岸上的志愿军海防部队在警惕地守卫着海防的同时，还帮助朝鲜渔民修补渔船、织补渔网。东海岸志愿军某部专门成立了一个铁匠炉，为附近的四个渔业生产合作社打了一千二百多个修补渔船用的钉子。还修理了其他工具八百多件。这支部队还把渔港附近六千公尺长的道路加修成公路，使渔民们捕到的鲜鱼能用汽车迅速运到附近的火车站。在志愿军的保护、帮助和渔民们的努力下，渔民们不断获得丰收。某渔业生产合作社三月份超额百分之五十完成了生产任务。荣获三级国旗勋章的捕鱼能手卢敬文带领的一只渔船，在最近三个月中完成了生产计划的百分之三百五十。
