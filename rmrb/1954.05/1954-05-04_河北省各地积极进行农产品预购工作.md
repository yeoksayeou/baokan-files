Hebei Province Actively Carries Out Pre-Purchase Work of Agricultural Products

The pre-purchase work of agricultural products has been universally launched in various parts of Hebei Province. As of mid-April, according to incomplete statistics from six special districts in the province, 45,310,000 jin of wheat have been pre-purchased, accounting for 16.53% of the province's total pre-purchased wheat; the amount of wheat pre-purchased in Handan Special District has reached 63.62% of the original plan. Shijiazhuang Special District has pre-purchased 4,360,000 jin of cotton and 3,230,000 jin of peanuts.

The Party committees and people's governments in various parts of Hebei generally attach great importance to the pre-purchase work of agricultural products. Supply and marketing cooperatives above the county level have established offices under the leadership of the local people's government's financial and economic committees to uniformly control and lead the pre-purchase work. Many areas have transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to assist grassroots units in carrying out pre-purchase work. The Luan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party uniformly allocated cadres to organize work teams, combining spring plowing and grain supply with the pre-purchase of agricultural products; more than 100 cadres were transferred from various county-level departments to participate in the work teams. Some areas have implemented democratic appraisal methods to reasonably distribute deposits and avoid phenomena such as equal distribution, which have been welcomed by the masses.

At present, a large number of pre-purchase deposits have been issued in various places. According to statistics from Cangxian and Tongxian Special Districts, 6,630 million yuan in cash and 6,340,000 jin of grain have been issued, helping farmers solve some difficulties in production and life, and supporting spring plowing production. For example, Hou Yongqing, a farmer in Mengxinzhuang, Jixian County, bought 40 jin of spring wheat seeds and a batch of fertilizer with the deposit after pre-selling 150 jin of wheat, and promptly planted three mu of spring wheat; an old lady in the village, who was over seventy years old, said with tears in her eyes when pre-selling agricultural products: "Before liberation, one year, during the period of food shortage, we sold three mu of land with green seedlings to others because of financial difficulties; now the government implements pre-purchase, so we don't have to worry about farming and living a little bit difficult."

    河北省各地积极进行农产品预购工作
    河北省各地预购农产品的工作，已普遍展开。截至四月中旬，据全省六个专区不完全的统计，预购的小麦已有四千五百三十一万斤，占全省预购小麦量的百分之十六点五三；邯郸专区预购小麦的数量，已达原计划的百分之六十三点六二。石家庄专区已预购棉花四百三十六万斤，花生三百二十三万斤。
    河北各地党委和人民政府对农产品预购工作一般都很重视。县以上供销合作社在当地人民政府财政经济委员会的领导下，都成立了办公室，统一掌握和领导预购工作。不少地区抽调了大批干部下乡，协助基层单位开展预购工作。中共滦县县委统一调配干部组织工作队，结合春耕、粮食供应工作预购农产品；县级各部门抽调一百多名干部参加了工作队。有些地区为了合理发放定金，避免平均分配等现象，实行了民主评议的办法，受到群众欢迎。
    目前，各地已发放了大批预购定金。据沧县、通县两个专区的统计，现已发出现款六十六亿三千余万元，另有粮食六百三十四万斤，帮助农民解决了生产和生活上的一些困难，支持了春耕生产。如蓟县孟新庄农民侯永庆预售一百五十斤小麦后，将定金买了四十斤春麦种和一批肥料，及时种上了三亩春麦；该村有一个七十多岁的老太太预售农产品时，感激得含着眼泪说：“解放前有一年，在青黄不接的时候，我们因为生活困难，把三亩带青苗的地卖给了别人；现在政府实行预购，咱们种地和生活上有点困难也不用发愁了。”
