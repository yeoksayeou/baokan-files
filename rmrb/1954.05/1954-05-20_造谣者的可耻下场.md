The Despicable End of Rumormongers
By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang

At a time when the Geneva Conference's discussions on the Indochina issue had entered the restricted session stage and were beginning to make some progress, powerful groups on the American and French sides deliberately created various atmospheres unfavorable to negotiation outside the conference, in order to obstruct the smooth progress of the conference. One prominent incident was the French side's sabotage of the agreement on the evacuation of wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu, and the rampant fabrication of rumors in an attempt to shift the responsibility onto the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. As the Paris newspaper "l'Humanité" said: "Bidault's attempt to make a big issue out of the wounded is only part of this whole trick; Bidault is trying his best to poison the atmosphere of the conference at a time when negotiations are likely to progress."

As everyone knows, at the second plenary session discussing the Indochina issue, Chief Representative Pham Van Dong declared that "the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has adhered to a humanitarian policy in this war, especially towards prisoners and wounded soldiers," and took the initiative to propose allowing the French side to evacuate the captured wounded from Dien Bien Phu. This proposal was approved by all parties, and an agreement was reached on the spot. On May 13th, representatives of the French army and the Vietnam People's Army reached a specific agreement in Dien Bien Phu: (1) Severely wounded prisoners of war will be transported in three batches, the first two batches including 753 people, and the number of the third batch will be determined by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army. (2) 80 to 100 people will be transported every day. (3) During the transportation of severely wounded prisoners of war, the French air force will cease operations in a certain area, that is, within 10 kilometers around Dien Bien Phu and on Highway 41 from Dien Bien Phu to Son La. Subsequently, the first batch of eleven wounded soldiers were successfully evacuated from Dien Bien Phu to Hanoi, which means that the proposal put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been realized on the battlefield, and the problem of evacuating the wounded from Dien Bien Phu has been successfully resolved.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has faithfully fulfilled its agreement, making every effort to take care of the wounded and assist them in their evacuation. This is obvious to all. The Swiss "Federal Gazette" put it this way: "In any case, according to recent news from Hanoi, the sincerity expressed by the Viet Minh military authorities is better than Bidault imagined." Agence France-Presse also had to admit: "The first batch of French wounded who arrived in Hanoi told nurses and doctors that they had been well treated and cared for by the Viet Minh," and "The French authorities set up sentries to prevent reporters from talking to the wounded, their excuse being that the wounded were too tired, but it is said that some of them were only injured in the legs and could still answer questions."

The work of evacuating the wounded had only been going on for one day when Bidault suddenly wrote a letter to Molotov on May 14th, in which he said: None of the wounded soldiers that the Vietnamese side was preparing to evacuate were from the Bao Dai puppet army; the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had put forward "new demands," that French planes should not attack Highway 41 during the evacuation of the wounded.

This is clearly making trouble out of nothing and creating side issues. The absurdity of this statement is not worth refuting. Of the first batch of 450 wounded soldiers to be evacuated, apart from the eleven who had arrived in Hanoi, the remaining 439 were still in Dien Bien Phu. How did Bidault know from there that there were no Bao Dai puppet soldiers among them? It was already clearly written in the agreement between the two sides on May 13th that the French air force should not operate over Highway 41 during the evacuation of the wounded. How did it become a "new demand" again? General Cogny, commander of the French invading forces in the northern region, publicly announced on behalf of General Navarre that he agreed to the above points of the agreement. How could Bidault pretend not to know, or turn his back on it just one day later?

Of course, Bidault's unreasonable behavior is supported secretly and openly by some people. Isn't it? Smith also wrote a letter to Molotov on the 15th, repeating the platitudes that Bidault had said, complaining that there were no Bao Dai puppet soldiers among the first batch of 450 wounded soldiers to be evacuated. Strangely enough, Smith has also become "benevolent"; the person who has supplied France with more than 1 billion US dollars worth of armaments to slaughter millions of people and is plotting to expand the Indochina war, preparing to create more deaths, is so "benevolent" at this time, which is naturally with ulterior motives.

Molotov gave a satisfactory reply to Bidault's letter on the 15th. However, after receiving the reply, Bidault refused to negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the one hand, and continued to spread the atmosphere that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was obstructing the evacuation of the wounded on the other. As the situation developed to the 17th, the French military headquarters even put forward six "suggestions" similar to an "ultimatum" to the headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army. These suggestions were so absurd that just two points can illustrate the others. For example, the French actually demanded in the "suggestions" to organize several mixed committees to supervise the traffic on Highway 41 and carry out the task of selecting and evacuating the wounded, etc. Highway 41 is the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and it is a battlefield. What right does France have to "supervise" it? Isn't this as ridiculous as someone suggesting to "supervise" the highway from Hanoi to Haiphong? Of course, the Vietnam People's Army wants to use Highway 41 to evacuate the wounded, and French planes must not attack it during the evacuation of the wounded, but this must never become a reason for "supervision." The Vietnam People's Army allows French planes to go to Dien Bien Phu to evacuate the wounded, and does not attack or supervise them. So what right does France have to turn around and "supervise" Highway 41?

The French military headquarters unilaterally announced the suspension of the evacuation of the wounded on the 15th, and began bombing Highway 41 on the evening of the 17th. The French side explained the "reasons" for taking this illegal measure as follows: (1) Evacuating the wounded by helicopters and small planes is too slow, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not repaired the airport in time; (2) The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has rejected the so-called "supervision" of Highway 41 proposed by the French side, and is using the road to transport troops and weapons; (3) Not a single wounded soldier from the Bao Dai puppet army has been sent back.

Because of the extensive publication of fact-distorting reports and deliberately fabricated rumors and slanders by reactionary newspapers in the United States and France, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a press conference at 2 p.m. on the 18th, and introduced the true facts about the evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu in detail. The spokesman of the delegation especially pointed out that the measures taken by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were in line with the principles of humanitarianism and respected their promises. For example, on the issue of the Bao Dai puppet army prisoners that the French side was clamoring about, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had already proposed not to discriminate, and in fact had never discriminated. However, the Bao Dai puppet army only accounted for one-eighth of the total number of French troops in Dien Bien Phu (not one-fourth as rumored), and most of them had surrendered to the Vietnam People's Army during the battle. There were very few wounded soldiers from the puppet army among the prisoners. Therefore, it was not surprising that there were no puppet soldiers in the first batch of evacuated wounded. Two hours later, the French delegation also held a press conference at the "House of Journalists".

It is worth noting that at the press conference of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the spokesman of the French delegation, Béhiers, and his assistant stenographer were mixed among the reporters, listening intently and taking notes, and sending the notes piece by piece to some place. Although the spokesman of the French delegation and the military expert who accompanied the press conference tried their best to distort the facts, they still could not conceal the contradictions in their statements. For example, when a reporter asked: "Why were there only eleven wounded soldiers evacuated the first time?" The spokesman explained it by reasons such as the bad weather and the small airport, of course, it could not make people believe that the French side was positive about the evacuation of the wounded. He repeatedly fabricated that the Vietnam People's Army was using Highway 41 to transport weapons. Reporters asked him: "Does the French side really know that the Viet Minh is using Highway 41 to transport weapons?" The spokesman said: "Not really know." Upon hearing this, the reporters couldn't help booing. Regarding Béhiers' repeated complaints in his speech that the Vietnam People's Army did not send back wounded soldiers from the Bao Dai puppet army, many reporters asked: "There were no wounded soldiers from Bao Dai among the eleven wounded soldiers evacuated in the first batch. Will there be any in the second batch?" He was forced to answer: "Maybe there are." As a result, it aroused the reporters' counter-question: "Then why do you accuse people of 'discrimination' and 'inhumanity' without waiting to find out?" At this time, the spokesman was speechless, so the reporters' laughter, boos, demands for "answers" and questions of "why not answer" were in a mess. Then, like a string of firecrackers, the reporters raised questions such as whether the French authorities had notified the Viet Minh and the Geneva Conference before the bombing and "what was the result of this bombing," which the spokesman could not give satisfactory answers to, and had to announce the end of the meeting in disgrace. As some reporters from the French bourgeois newspapers reflected, the honest reporters from various countries, especially France, almost reached an impassioned level at this press conference. This is the end of hypocrites and rumormongers.

People still remember that when Bidault first arrived in Geneva in late April, he "appealed" for the evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu "for humanitarian reasons." The Soviet and Chinese sides expressed sympathy and suggested that he negotiate with the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to resolve the issue. But Bidault didn't do it, and his "humanity" quickly ran away. At that time, the general comment was that he issued such an "appeal" just to deal with public opinion and cope with the parliament. This time, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took the initiative to propose the evacuation of the wounded, and although Bidault accepted it, he turned his back on it after only one day. In the entire process of evacuating the wounded, they sent helicopters to evacuate eleven French wounded soldiers, but at the same time sent fighter-bombers to bomb and kill fifteen French prisoners of war. This is the "humanity" of Bidault and his ilk.

Today, fair-minded public opinion here believes that the American warmongers and the French hawks are launching a "psychological war" by taking advantage of the issue of evacuating the wounded. They do not want to evacuate the wounded in real terms, because if they really evacuate them, they will have nothing to write about. Moreover, they are very afraid of evacuating the wounded, fearing that after a long period of war, they will issue calls to stop the Indochina war, fearing that they will tell the truth about the Vietnam People's Army's lenient treatment of prisoners and care for the wounded, and fearing that they will expose the real situation inside the French Expeditionary Force. Of course, in their opinion, it is a win-win situation to not leak these things that give them a headache, and to use them to spread rumors and create trouble, and delay the conference, in order to make the conference a failure, so as to expand the Indochina war.

However, the truth cannot be covered up for a long time. At the Geneva Conference, the fair and reasonable settlement of the Indochina issue is the unanimous demand of the people of the world, especially the French people. The lessons of history are that those who violate the will of the people will eventually find themselves "bleeding and broken" and spurned by the people. May 18

    造谣者的可耻下场
    本报记者　吴文焘　李庄
    在日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论已进入限制性会议阶段，并开始取得一些进展的时候，美法方面有势力的集团却在会外故意制造各种不利于协商的气氛，以阻碍会议的顺利进行。突出的事件之一，就是法国方面破坏了关于撤退奠边府伤员的协议，并大肆制造谣言，妄图把责任推到越南民主共和国身上。正如巴黎“人道报”所说的：“皮杜尔企图在伤员问题上大作文章，这只是这种整个诡计的一部分；皮杜尔千方百计要在谈判正可能进展的时候毒化会议的气氛。”
    大家知道，在讨论印度支那问题的第二次全体会议上，范文同首席代表声明“越南民主共和国政府在此次战争中，向持人道政策，对于俘虏和伤兵尤其是如此”，主动提出允许法国方面撤退在奠边府被俘的伤员，这个建议受到各方面的赞同，当场达成了协议。五月十三日，法军代表和越南人民军代表在奠边府达成具体协议：（一）重伤战俘分三批运送，头两批包括七百五十三名，第三批人数由越南人民军总司令部决定之。（二）每天运送八十人到一百人。（三）在运送重伤战俘期间，法空军在一定地区即奠边府周围十公里内及从奠边府到山萝的第四十一号公路停止活动。此后，第一批伤员十一名即顺利由奠边府撤至河内，这就是说越南民主共和国代表团提出的建议已在战地实现了，撤退奠边府伤员的问题已经顺利解决了。
    越南民主共和国方面忠实地履行了自己的协议，尽一切努力照顾伤员，并协助他们撤退，这是有目共睹的。瑞士“联邦报”就这样说道：“不论怎么样，根据最近从河内获得的消息，越盟军事当局所表示的诚意比皮杜尔所想像的好”。法新社也不得不承认：“第一批运抵河内的法国伤员，曾告诉护士与医生说：他们曾受到越盟很好的对待与照顾”，而“法国当局设了哨兵，禁止记者与伤员谈话，他们的借口是伤员已过度疲劳，但据说有些人只是腿部受伤尚可以回答问题”。
    撤退伤员的工作仅仅进行了一天，五月十四日皮杜尔突然写给莫洛托夫一信，其中说：越南方面准备撤退的伤员中没有一个保大伪军；越南民主共和国方面提出了“新要求”，在撤退伤员期间法国飞机不得袭击四十一号公路。
    这显然是无理取闹，节外生枝，其说法之荒谬是不值一驳的。第一批准备撤退的四百五十名伤员，除十一名已到河内外，其余四百三十九名尚在奠边府，皮杜尔从那里知道里面没有保大伪军？法国空军在撤退伤员期间不得在四十一号公路上空活动，五月十三日双方协议中已经写得明明白白，怎么又变成“新要求”了？法国侵略军北部地区司令戈涅将军代表纳瓦尔将军公开宣布同意上述几点协议，皮杜尔怎么能够装作不知道，或者仅仅过了一天就翻脸不认账了？
    当然皮杜尔这样无理取闹是有人暗中和公开支持的。不是吗？史密斯在十五日也给莫洛托夫写了一封信，重复皮杜尔说过的滥调，埋怨第一批将要撤退的四百五十名伤员中没有保大伪军。奇怪得很，史密斯居然也“仁慈”起来了；已经供给了法国十亿美元以上的军火来屠杀了千千万万人的人而且正在策动扩大印度支那战争，准备制造更多的死亡的人，在这个时候这么“仁慈”，自然是别有用心的。
    对于皮杜尔的来信，莫洛托夫在十五日作了圆满的答复。但皮杜尔接到复信后，一方面拒绝和越南民主共和国协商，一方面更继续散布越南民主共和国阻挠撤退伤员的空气。事情发展到十七日，法军司令部更向越南人民军司令部提出了六点类似
  “最后通牒”的“建议”，这些建议竟是如此荒谬，只要举出两点就可以说明其他了。例如，法国在“建议”中竟要求组织若干混合委员会监督四十一号公路的交通，并执行挑选和撤退伤员之任务等等。四十一号公路是越南民主共和国的领土，是战地，法国有什么权利去“监督”呢？这不是和有人提出“监督”河内到海防的公路一样可笑么？当然，越南人民军要利用四十一号公路撤退伤员，法国飞机在撤退伤员期间不得加以攻击，但这绝不能成为“监督”的理由。越南人民军允许法国飞机到奠边府撤退伤员，也不加以攻击，更不加以监督，那么法国有什么权利反转来“监督”四十一号公路呢？
    法军司令部在十五日片面宣布中止撤退伤员，并在十七日晚开始轰炸四十一号公路。法方解释采取这种非法措施的“理由”说：（一）以直升飞机和小型飞机撤退伤员，速度太慢，越南民主共和国没有及时修好机场；（二）越南民主共和国拒绝法方所提对四十一号公路的所谓“监督”，并以该路运输部队武器；（三）保大伪军伤员一个也没有被送回。
    由于美法等国的反动报纸连篇累牍地登载歪曲事实的报道和有意制造的谣言和诽谤，十八日下午二时，越南民主共和国代表团举行记者招待会，详细地介绍了撤退奠边府伤员问题的事实真相。代表团发言人特别指出：越南民主共和国采取的措施，既合乎人道主义的原则，又尊重自己的诺言。例如，法国方面大吵大叫的保大伪军俘虏的问题，越南民主共和国早已提出不加歧视，实际上从来没有加以歧视。但保大伪军仅占奠边府法军总数的八分之一（并非如外传的四分之一），且在战斗过程中多数已投降越南人民军，俘虏中伪军伤员甚少。因此，第一批撤退的伤员中没有伪军，原无足奇。两小时以后法国代表团也在“记者之家”举行记者招待会。
    值得注意的是，在越南民主共和国的记者招待会上，法国代表团发言人贝延斯和他的助手速记员都混在记者之间，紧张地听和作记录，并将记录稿一段一段地往什么地方送。法国代表团的发言人和陪同主持招待会的军事专家，虽然竭力歪曲事实，但仍不能掩盖前后发言中的矛盾。例如，有记者问：“到底为什么第一次撤出的伤员只有十一人？”发言人以天气不好，机场狭小等理由来说明，当然不能使人相信法方对撤退伤员是积极的。他一再捏造越南人民军利用四十一号公路运送武器，记者们问他：“法国方面是否确实知道越盟利用四十一号公路运送武器？”这位发言人说：“不确实知道”。记者们听了，不禁嘘声四起。对于贝延斯在发言中一再埋怨越南人民军不遣送保大伪军伤员事，不少记者问：“第一批撤退的十一个伤员中没有保大的伤员，第二批有没有呢？”他被迫回答说：“或者是有的”。结果，引起了记者们的反问：“那么为什么不等查清楚就指责人家‘歧视’和‘不人道’呢？”这时这位发言人哑口无言，于是记者们笑声、嘘声、要求“回答”以及“为什么不回答”的质问声，乱成一团。接着，像连珠炮一样地，记者们又提出在轰炸前法国当局是否通知了越盟和日内瓦会议以及“这次轰炸的结果如何”这样的问题，这位发言人都不能给以满意的答复，只有灰溜溜地宣布散会了。正像法国资产阶级报纸一些记者所反映的，这次记者招待会上各国特别是法国的正直记者们，简直达到了激昂的地步。这就是伪君子和造谣者的下场。
    人们都还记得，皮杜尔在四月下旬刚刚到达日内瓦的时候，曾经“为了人道的理由”“呼吁”撤退奠边府的伤员。苏中方面表示同情，并建议他和越南民主共和国代表团协商解决这个问题。但是皮杜尔不干了，他的“人道”很快就跑掉了。当时一般的评论是他发出那样的“呼吁”，不过是为了应付舆论，应付议会而已。这次越南民主共和国代表团主动提出撤退伤员的建议，皮杜尔虽然接受了，但只过了一天又不干了。在整个撤退伤员的过程中，他们派直升飞机撤出了十一个法军伤员，同时却派战斗轰炸机炸死了十五个法军伤俘，这就是皮杜尔们的“人道”。
    今天，这里的公正舆论认为，美国的战争贩子们和法国的主战派是借着撤退伤员的问题，发动了一场“心理战”，他们并不想真正撤退伤员，因为如果真正撤退了，他就没有文章作了。而且，他们十分害怕撤出伤员，怕他们在久经战祸之后发出要求停止印度支那战争的呼吁，怕他们说出越南人民军宽待俘虏、照顾伤员的事，害怕他们揭露法国远征军内部的真实情况。当然，在他们看来，既不泄露这些使他们头痛的东西，又能借以造谣生事，延宕会议，以达到使会议失败，从而扩大印度支那战争，这是一举两得的事。
    但是，真理是不能长期被遮盖的。在日内瓦会议上，公平合理地解决印度支那问题是全世界人民，特别是法国人民的一致要求，历史的殷鉴是，违反人民意志的人们最终将发现自己“头破血流”，为人民所唾弃。　五月十八日
