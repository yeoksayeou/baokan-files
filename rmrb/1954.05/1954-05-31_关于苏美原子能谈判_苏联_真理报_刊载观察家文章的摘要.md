Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th: Today, "Pravda" published an article by "Observer" entitled "On the Soviet-U.S. Atomic Energy Negotiations".

    The article said that recently, many messages regarding the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of atomic energy have been published in American newspapers. The authors of these messages, on the one hand, distorted the Soviet Union's position, and also talked about why the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the atomic issue have not produced the desired results so far.
    American newspapers have also published some messages indicating that the United States is studying a new plan that stipulates the establishment of an “international atomic materials co-storage” without the participation of the Soviet Union. For example, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William K. Foster put forward this plan in a statement to the press on May 18.
    In this regard, it is worth noting President Eisenhower's reply to a reporter's question at a press conference on May 19. The President said that he was working with some of his advisors to study how the United States could make progress on the atomic energy issue "without waiting for anyone." Newspapers interpreted this statement as confirming the news of the breakdown of the U.S.-Soviet atomic issue negotiations.
    The article continued, the U.S. side is attempting to give the public a one-sided, distorted impression of the progress of the negotiations, while the other side's opinion is either not known or distorted.
    What were the starting points for both sides at the beginning of the negotiations? When President Eisenhower proposed holding secret talks with representatives of other "major relevant" countries, he declared that the United States would propose the establishment of an international atomic energy agency so that countries possessing atomic weapons would donate "some of their stockpiled normal uranium and fissionable materials" to this agency for peaceful purposes. The Soviet government emphasized that the Soviet Union has always believed and will continue to believe that the most important and urgent task is the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet Union's new proposal advocated that, in the spirit of easing international tensions, all countries participating in the agreement should undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Of course, this obligation should first be borne by the governments of the five major powers – the United States, Britain, France, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. Everyone also knows that the People's Republic of China has expressed its approval of this Soviet proposal.
    The article said that, however, the situation in the past five months has aroused legitimate suspicion among the people of all countries, who doubt the sincerity of the initiative put forward by the U.S. side last December. They have been seeing that, just as negotiations are being held to seek an "acceptable solution" to the atomic arms race, as Eisenhower said, the United States is taking more and more steps to intensify this race.
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a statement on March 20 about the use of atomic weapons "for strategic purposes and tactical purposes." U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Strauss announced on April 7 that Eisenhower personally ordered an increase in the production of hydrogen bombs in February. Finally, Eisenhower himself pointed out in his message to Congress on January 7 the "effectiveness of this new type of weapon (atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons – Observer's note)". Therefore, it is not surprising that the attempts of American diplomats to turn the solution of the atomic issue into a conspiracy to establish an "international agency" that only uses "certain parts of stockpiled atomic materials" for peaceful purposes will arouse increasing distrust among the broad public everywhere, including the American public. More and more people are gradually realizing that implementing such measures without countries reaching an agreement not to use atomic weapons can only relax the vigilance of people of all countries in the face of the threat of atomic war.
    The article said that, on this point, a sober view published by the American "New Republic Magazine" can be cited. On January 11, this magazine pointed out that Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations on the establishment of an international atomic energy agency "is looking less and less like a statement that we are willing to cooperate with the Russians in the development of atomic energy, and more and more like a roundabout statement, implying that we are no longer prepared to negotiate with them on the issue of controlling atomic weapons."
    This admission convincingly shows that it is by no means accidental that the U.S. plan does not mention the main issue, namely the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass destruction.
    First of all, having countries hand over a small portion of their atomic stockpiles to an international agency for peaceful purposes does not help to achieve the goal Eisenhower talked about on December 8. In fact, according to this proposal, most of the atomic materials will still be used to produce more and more atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.
    Second, even using this small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes is only to give the impression that the amount of "atomic fuel" used to produce bombs will be reduced. Everyone knows that the production of these materials has developed so rapidly in some countries that allocating a small portion of them for peaceful uses simply cannot slow down the arms race.
    It should be pointed out that many well-informed people in the West and the United States hold this view. For example, the well-known Bernard Baruch said in a speech on May 3 regarding Eisenhower's proposal to establish an "international atomic materials co-storage": "No matter how much material is taken into the international co-storage, countries will still possess most of the fissionable material that can be used to develop atomic weapons and other thermonuclear weapons. The threat of atomic attack will not be reduced; the atomic arms race will not slow down."
    It can be seen that the U.S. proposal, which does not mention the main issue, that is, the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, is merely trying to create the illusion of reducing the production of these weapons, thereby allowing people of all countries to relax their vigilance in the face of the growing threat of using weapons of mass destruction of humanity to engage in war.
    The article said that, as mentioned earlier, the American side is currently engaged in a new conspiracy, wanting to establish a so-called "international atomic materials co-storage" without the participation of the Soviet Union. People also cannot ignore a message that has been circulating everywhere recently, namely that the United States is preparing to convene an international atomic conference. It is very obvious that all these measures are for a very clear and definite purpose: the American ruling groups want to gain control over the atomic research work of all capitalist countries, and for this purpose use the efforts of scientists from other countries.
    The article concluded by saying that the people of all countries in the world must clearly recognize that the U.S. proposal to establish a world atomic co-storage cannot save humanity from the horrors of atomic war, nor can it divert the attention of the people of all countries from this danger. The Soviet public, together with the public of other countries, advocates the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, while establishing effective international supervision. Only in this way can humanity be free from the threat of atomic war, and atomic energy can be used to benefit humanity.

    关于苏美原子能谈判
    ——苏联“真理报”刊载观察家文章的摘要
   【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：今天“真理报”刊载了“观察家”的一篇文章，题目是：“关于苏美原子能谈判”。
    文章说，最近美国报纸上刊载了许多关于美国和苏联在原子能问题上的立场的消息。这些消息的作者一方面对苏联的立场加以歪曲，同时也谈到了为什么美苏关于原子问题的谈判迄今没有产生应有的结果的问题。
    美国报纸也刊载了一些消息，表明美国正在研究一个规定建立一个不要苏联参加的“原子物资国际共储”的新计划。例如，前美国国防部副部长威廉·克·福斯特在五月十八日向报界发表的声明中就曾提出这个计划。
    在这一方面值得注意的是美国总统艾森豪威尔五月十九日在记者招待会上对记者的一个问题的答复。总统说，他正在和他的一些顾问们共同研究美国怎样可以“不等待任何人”而在原子能问题上作出进展的问题。报纸对这个声明的解释是，这证实了关于美苏原子问题谈判破裂的消息。
    文章接着说，美方这样做就是企图使舆论对于谈判的进行情况获得一个片面的、歪曲的印象，而同时另一方的意见则不是不被人知道就是被歪曲了。
    双方在谈判开始时的出发点是怎样的呢？艾森豪威尔总统在建议与其他“主要有关”的国家的代表举行秘密谈判时宣称，美国将建议设立一个国际原子能机构，以便拥有原子武器的国家捐献“一些它们储存的常态铀和可分裂物质”给这个机构以用于和平目的。而苏联政府强调指出，苏联过去一向认为而且将来仍然认为，最重要的而且刻不容缓的任务，是无条件地禁止原子武器、氢武器以及所有其他大规模毁灭性的武器。苏联的新建议主张，参与协议的各国，出于缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不再使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。当然，这种义务首先应由五大国——美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国与苏联——政府承担。大家也知道：中华人民共和国已对苏联的这种建议表示赞成。
    文章说，然而过去五个月来的情况已经引起了各国人民正当的怀疑，他们怀疑美方在去年十二月提出的倡议是否具有诚意。他们一直看到，正当举行谈判来求得一个关于原子军备竞赛的如艾森豪威尔所说的“能让人接受的解决办法”的时候，美国却在采取越来越多的步骤来加紧进行这种竞赛。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在三月二十日发表一篇关于可以使用原子武器“于战略目的以及战术目的”的声明。美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯于四月七日宣布，艾森豪威尔于二月间亲自下令增加氢弹的生产。最后，艾森豪威尔本人也在一月七日致国会的咨文里指出“这种新型武器（原子武器与氢武器——观察家注）的效用”。因此，美国外交官们企图把原子问题的解决变为建立一种只把“储存的原子物资的某些部分”用于和平目的的“国际机构”的阴谋，一定会引起各处的广大公众、包括美国公众越来越大的不信任，是不足为奇的。越来越多的人民日渐认识到：假若没有各国达成一种不得使用原子武器的协议就实行这种措施，只能松懈各国人民在面临原子战威胁的时候的警惕性。
    文章说，关于这一点，可以举出美国“新共和杂志”发表的一个清醒的看法。一月十一日，这个杂志指出：艾森豪威尔在联合国发表的关于成立国际原子能机构的演说“越来越不像是表示我们愿意在发展原子能方面与俄国人合作的声明了，它越来越像是转弯抹角的声明，暗示我们再不准备在管制原子武器的问题上与他们谈判”。
    这种承认令人信服地说明了，美国的计划中没有提到主要问题，即禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的问题，决不是偶然的。
    首先，各国拿出它们的原子储存中的一小部分交给一个国际机构以用于和平目的并不能有助于达到艾森豪威尔在十二月八日谈到的目标。事实上根据这个建议，大部分原子物资还是会用于生产越来越多的原子弹和氢弹。
    第二，甚至把这一小部分原子物资用于和平目的也不过是想给人一种仿佛用于生产炸弹的“原子燃料”的数量会减少的印象而已。大家知道，这些物资的生产在某些国家中发展得如此迅速，以致把其中一小部分拨作和平用途根本放慢不了军备竞赛。
    应该指出，西方以及美国的许多消息灵通人士都持有这种看法。例如，人所共知的伯·巴鲁克在五月三日就艾森豪威尔的成立“国际原子物资共储”的建议发表的演说中说：“无论拿到国际共储的物资有多少，各国还是会拥有大部分可分裂的物质可以用来发展原子武器和其他热核子武器。原子进攻的威胁不会减少；原子军备竞赛不会放缓下来。”
    可见，美国的不提主要问题、即不提禁止使用原子武器问题的建议只不过是想造成一种减少这些武器的生产的错觉，从而使得各国人民在日益增长的使用大规模毁灭人类的武器来从事战争的威胁面前松懈警惕而已。
    文章说，如前面所指出的，目前美国方面正在从事一个新的阴谋，想成立一个没有苏联参加的所谓“国际原子物资共储”。人们也不能无视近来到处流传着的一个消息，即美国正在准备召开一个国际原子会议。十分明显，这一切措施都是为了一个十分清楚、明确的目的：美国统治集团想取得对所有资本主义国家的原子研究工作的控制权，并为此目的利用其他国家科学家的努力。
    文章最后说，世界各国人民必须清楚地认识到，美国的成立世界原子共储的建议决不能使人类摆脱原子战争的恐怖，决不能转移各国人民对这种危险的注意。苏联公众与其他国家的公众一起，主张无条件禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，同时建立有效的国际监督。只有这样，人类才能不受原子战争的威胁，原子能才能用来为人类造福。
