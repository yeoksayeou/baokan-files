Launch a Technical Innovation Movement to Improve Production Efficiency

    Electric Heater for Welding and Heating Wheel Rims
    Zhang Longwu, a vehicle electrician technician from the Hengyang Vehicle Section of the Guangzhou Railway Administration, successfully created an "electric heater for welding and heating wheel rims." In the past, railway departments across the country did not have heating equipment for welding wheel rims. When welders were welding wheel rims, they had to use firewood and charcoal to bake them, which made the workshop very hot and filled with black smoke, seriously harming the health of the workers. Moreover, the wheel rims welded in this way cooled and contracted too quickly, often causing the wheel hoops to crack, resulting in traffic accidents and seriously affecting the safety of railway transportation. Last year, there were seventeen traffic accidents caused by cracked wheel hoops on railways across the country; the section also had sixteen pairs of cracked wheel hoops in January this year.
    Using the "electric heater for welding and heating wheel rims" created by Zhang Longwu, the welder only needs to put the wheel into the heater, turn on the switch, and it can reach the specified temperature in about forty-five minutes. In February and the first half of March, the Hengyang Vehicle Section used the "electric heater for welding and heating wheel rims" to weld fifty-two pairs of wheel rims, and none of them cracked after being checked and repaired by an electromagnetic flaw detector. The quality fully meets the standards.
    Now, Zhang Longwu is continuing to work with veteran workers to study four kinds of tools, such as "electric vertical screw remover" and "pneumatic rust hammer," to gradually mechanize manual operations.
    Electric Sieve
    Wang Haide, a model worker from Mudanjiang City and a production innovator at the state-owned No. 1 Rubber Factory, created a special electric sieve for zinc oxide after creating four kinds of machinery (see page 2 of this newspaper on February 13 for the situation of Wang Haide's creation of four kinds of machinery). After two test runs, the situation was good.
    Processing zinc oxide is the only manual labor left in the pharmaceutical material processing workshop where Wang Haide works. The processing volume accounts for more than 70% of the workshop's total processing tasks. After the special electric sieve for zinc oxide was made, the processing efficiency of zinc oxide increased to about 420%, which completely eliminated the manual operation method in the workshop and fully guaranteed the supply of raw materials to the factory's production workshop.
    In the process of creating the special electric sieve for zinc oxide, Wang Haide and his assistant, Nie Qingtang, continued to carry forward the spirit of hard work and innovative creation, and overcame various complex technical difficulties again and again. According to the performance of zinc oxide, the special electric sieve for zinc oxide is required to shake once every two or three minutes during sieving to avoid the medicine from filling the sieve bottom. After painstaking research, Wang Haide and Nie Qingtang created a palm-shaped automatic collision wheel, which solved this difficulty.
    Wind Screening Lime Machine
    Employees of the Mechanized Supply Station of the Construction Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry have created and improved many machines and tools in the technical innovation movement. They have created and modified "aerial ropeway and sliding wire," and "dual-purpose iron tower," which have solved the horizontal and vertical transportation problems in construction, saving labor and expenses, and accelerating the progress of the project. The employees of the station have also created six machines, such as "wind screening lime machine," "automatic concrete batching machine," "automatic sand loading machine," and "tractor," which have brought a new look to the construction. For example, in the past, filtering lime was to dig a large pit, and then manually put the lime in a wooden trough and filter it into the pit little by little. This not only wasted labor, but also affected the health of workers. Now, using the "wind screening lime machine," the lime is placed in a modified mixer. When the iron balls or large pebbles in the machine rotate, the lime is pulverized, and then the lime is blown out by a blower. In this way, 50,000 yuan of processing fee can be saved per ton of lime, and the phenomenon of cracks on the lime wall in the past is completely overcome by using raw lime powder to plaster the wall, and it is very suitable for winter construction.
    Bamboo Curtain Net False Roof Coal Mining Method
    Li Song, a technician from the Nanling Coal Mine in Hunan Province, and workers Ma Lianfei, Wang Le'an, and Hu Jiusan, with the strong support of the Party committee, collectively created the bamboo curtain net false roof coal mining method after many days of experiments. After this new coal mining method was implemented in the mine, the recovery rate has been increased from 68% to 94%, and the output of 26 tons has been increased for every 100 tons of underground resources. This year, it will create a wealth of 9.4 billion yuan for the country. In addition, the implementation of this new coal mining method can also significantly improve the quality of coal, reduce the consumption of pit wood, and create favorable conditions for the safe production of coal mines and the promotion of mechanization. The cost of this coal mining method is very low (only 7,100 yuan per square meter of bamboo curtain net), but it can fully utilize the potential of the mine and create a large amount of wealth. It can be promoted in inclined and steeply inclined medium-thick and thick coal seams, and coal mines with easily falling roofs.
    In the past, the Nanling Coal Mine used the old horizontal layered coal mining method with roof coal left behind. One meter would be wasted for every two meters of thick coal mined, and more than 1,000 tons of coal were lost in the first half of last year. Due to the poor coal mining method, the quality of products was also poor; the safety of workers' operations was not guaranteed, and accidents occurred frequently, which seriously affected the completion of the national plan. Since the mine adopted the bamboo curtain net false roof coal mining method, a new production situation has emerged, and the national plan has been overfulfilled.
    Milling Machine Works Instead of Planer
    The production task of the planer group in the Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Factory in Jiangxi Province was the most heavy in the whole factory. In December last year, working in two shifts was not enough to complete the plan. This year, the task is even greater. Seeing more and more semi-finished products being transported, Bao Shanhua, a young planer, was racking his brains day and night for this matter. One day, he walked to a milling machine and looked at it for a while, and said to himself: "The planer is busy all the time, but this guy is idle all year round. It would be great if it could be used!" From then on, he wanted to change the milling machine to a tool holder to replace the planer. After hard research, he drew the picture. The factory specially held a rationalization proposal committee to discuss Bao Shanhua's picture. After discussion, and after two experiments, the experiment was finally successful. This milling machine can not only do its own work, but also replace the planer to plane the plane and the outer circle, and the efficiency is higher than the planer. In the past, three shifts could not complete the task, but now it has been changed to two shifts, and the workers still complain that there is not enough work. In the past, it took 29 minutes, including auxiliary time, to plane a three-inch tee used on a water pipe with a planer, but now it only takes 5 minutes and 25 seconds with a milling machine.
    Automated Four-Spindle Drill Press
    Yang Yongyu, a technician and Communist Party member of the Kailuan Machinery Repair Factory, transformed an old-fashioned electric single-spindle drill press into a fully automated four-spindle drill press. This automatic four-spindle drill press was officially put into production on April 27.
    This automatic four-spindle drill press is equipped with four drill rods, which can drill four holes at the same time; it can automatically feed the tool; after drilling, the drill press will automatically stop; the chuck turntable can clamp workpieces for two uses at both ends of the rotating shaft. After drilling one end of the workpiece, turning the chuck can continue to drill the other end of the workpiece. It strongly guarantees the balanced production of electric skids (Note: Electric skids are a major mechanical equipment in China's coal mines to gradually realize mechanized coal mining, replacing manual transportation). The production efficiency has been increased by two and a half times, and the physical labor of workers has been reduced. In the research process, Yang Yongyu humbly listened to the opinions of other technicians and received help from the workers.
    Automatic Yarn Breakage Recording Device
    Mao Zixiang, a technician in the weaving workshop of the Qingdao State-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, has achieved initial success in the research of an automatic yarn breakage recording device, which can accurately reflect the yarn breakage situation of the loom and save the labor of workers in self-checking yarn breakage. At the beginning, Mao Zixiang found some old gears in the waste warehouse, and made connecting rods, springs, turntables and other parts himself for trial production. After the first trial production was successful, the recording was not accurate enough. Therefore, he continued to conduct research and solicited the opinions of the workers, and finally overcame the problem of inaccurate counting. It took two weeks to successfully produce the trial product. Worker Hou Qiqing said: "With this device, we don't have to grope around anymore. In the future, we can repair the machines with a clear understanding of the yarn breakage situation."

    开展技术革新运动提高生产效率
    焊烧车轮电热加温器
    广州铁路管理局衡阳车辆段车电技术员张隆武，创造“焊烧车轮电热加温器”成功。过去全国各地铁路部门都没有焊接车轮的加温设备，电焊工人在焊烧车轮时，只好用柴和木炭来烤，弄得车间温度很高，满屋都是黑烟，严重地损害了工人身体健康。而且，这样焊烧出的车轮冷却收缩太快，往往轮箍崩裂，造成行车事故，严重地影响铁路运输的安全。全国铁路去年一年因轮箍崩裂造成的行车事故就有十七件；该段在今年一月份也曾发生十六对轮箍崩裂事故。
    使用张隆武创造的“焊烧车轮电热加温器”，电焊工人只把车轮放进加温器，将电钮扭开，四十五分钟左右就能达到规定的温度。衡阳车辆段在二月和三月上半月，用“焊烧车轮电热加温器”焊烧出的五十二对车轮，经电磁探伤器检查和镟修，没有一对崩裂，质量完全合乎标准。
    现在，张隆武正在继续和老工人一起，研究“电动立柱螺丝裂卸器”、“风力打锈锤”等四种工具，使人力操作逐步机械化。
    电动筛
    牡丹江市劳动模范、国营第一橡胶厂生产革新者王海德，继创造四种机械（王海德创造四种机械的情况，见本报二月十三日第二版）之后，又创造了氧化锌专用电动筛，经过两度试车，情形良好。
    加工氧化锌，是王海德所在车间——药料加工车间仅剩下的一种手工劳动，加工量占车间全部加工任务百分之七十以上。氧化锌专用电动筛制成以后，就使氧化锌加工效率提高到百分之四百二十左右，根本消灭了该车间的手工作业方式，充分地保证了对全厂生产车间原材料的供应。
    在氧化锌专用电动筛的创制过程中，王海德和他的助手聂庆堂，继续发扬了刻苦钻研的革新创造精神，一次又一次地克服了各种复杂的技术上的困难。根据氧化锌这种药料的性能，要求氧化锌专用电动筛在筛动中，必须每隔二、三分钟颠动一次，以免药料弥塞箩底。王海德和聂庆堂经过苦心钻研，创制了掌形的自动撞轮，解决了这一困难。
    风筛白灰机
    中央重工业部建设工程公司机械化供应站职工，在技术革新运动中创制和改进了不少机械和工具。他们已创造和改装了“空中索道和走线滑子”、“两用铁塔”，解决了施工中的水平运输和垂直运输问题，节省了人工、费用，加速了工程进度。该站职工还创造了“风筛白灰机”、“混凝土自动配料机”、“自动装砂机”、“牵引车”等六项机械，在施工中出现了新的面貌。如过去滤白灰是先挖个大坑，然后用人工把灰放在木槽里，一点一点地往坑里滤。这样，不但浪费人工，而且影响工人身体健康，现在使用“风筛白灰机”，把灰放在改装过的搅拌机里，机器里的铁球或大卵石在转动时，就把灰打成粉末，然后用鼓风机把灰吹出去。这样做，每吨白灰可节省五万元的加工费，并由于用生白石灰粉末抹墙面，完全克服了过去白灰墙面裂缝的现象，而且极适合于冬季施工。
    竹帘网假顶采煤法
    湖南南岭煤矿技术员李嵩与工人马连飞、王乐安、胡九三等在党委大力的支持下，经过许多天的试验，集体创造了竹帘网假顶采煤法。这个新采煤法在该矿推行后，已使回采率由百分之六十八提高到百分之九十四，每百吨地下资源中增加了二十六吨采出量，今年将为国家创造九十四亿元的财富。此外，实行这个新采煤法还能显著地提高煤的质量、降低坑木消耗，并且给煤矿的安全生产和推行机械化创造有利的条件。这个采煤方法所费的成本很低（每平方公尺竹帘网只费七千一百元），但能充分发挥矿井的潜力，创造大量的财富，凡倾斜的急倾斜的中厚和厚煤层、顶板易落的煤矿都可以推行。
    过去，南岭煤矿沿用旧的留护顶煤水平分层采煤法，每采两公尺厚煤就要浪费一公尺，去年上半年就损失煤一千多吨。由于采煤方法不良，又使得产品质量低劣；工人作业安全没有保证，事故时常发生，严重影响国家计划的完成。该矿自从采用竹帘网假顶采煤法后，出现了新的生产局面，超额完成了国家计划。
    铣床替刨床干活
    江西萍乡煤矿机厂全厂的生产任务以刨床组最为繁重，去年十二月份分两班工作，还完不成计划。今年，任务就更大了，眼看运来的半成品越堆越多，这时，青年刨工包善华就日夜为这件事动脑筋。一天，他走到一部铣床旁看了一阵，自言自语地说：“刨床忙个不停，这家伙却整年闲着，能利用起来多好啊！”从此，他就想把铣床改个刀架，来代替刨床用。经过艰苦钻研，他把图画好了。厂里为包善华这张图专门召开了一个合理化建议委员会来讨论，讨论后，又经过两次试验，终于试验成功。这部铣床既可干本身的活，又能代替刨床刨平面和外圆，并且效率比刨床还高。以前，开三班，也完不成任务，现在又改成两班，工人还叫活不够。以前，用刨床刨一个水管上用的直径三寸的三通，连辅助时间在内需二十九分钟，现在用铣床，只要五分二十五秒钟。
    自动化四眼钻床
    开滦机械制修厂技术员、共产党员杨永育，把一台旧式电动单眼钻床改造成全部自动化的四眼钻床。这台自动四眼钻床已在四月二十七日正式投入生产。
    这台自动四眼钻床装有四个钻杆，可以同时钻四个孔；可以自动进刀；钻完活，钻床便自动停下来；卡活转盘可以在转轴两端卡上两次用的工作物，钻完一端的工作物，把卡盘一转，便可以继续钻另一端的工作物。有力地保证了制做电溜子的均衡生产（按：电溜子是我国煤矿逐步实现机械化采煤中，代替人力运输的一种主要机械设备）。生产效率提高了两倍半，并减轻了工人的体力劳动。在研究过程中，杨永育虚心地听取了其他技术人员的意见，和得到了工人们的帮助。
    断头自动记录装置
    青岛国营第一棉纺织厂织布车间技师毛滋祥，研究断头自动记录装置已获初步成功，它既能准确地反映布机断头情况，又能节省工人在自查断头时的劳动力。开始，毛滋祥在废品库里找到了一些旧齿轮，并且自己赶制了连杆、弹簧、转盘等零件，进行试制。第一次试制成功后，记录不够准确，于是，他继续进行研究，并征求了工人的意见，终于克服了记数不准确的毛病，前后共花了两个星期试制成功。现在这种装置已安在一部分车上试用。工人侯其清说：“有了这个装置，我们就不用瞎摸索了，以后可以根据断头情况，心中有数地来检修机台了。”
