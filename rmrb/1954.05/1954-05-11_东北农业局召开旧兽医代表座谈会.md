The Northeast Administrative Committee's Agricultural Bureau convened a symposium of old veterinary representatives in April, aiming to fully leverage the role of old veterinarians in preventing and controlling livestock epidemics and promoting the development of animal husbandry. More than 60 people attended the meeting, including veterinary work leaders from various provinces and cities and representatives of old veterinarians. The meeting summarized the work of old veterinarians in recent years. There are more than 6,500 old veterinarians in the region, which is ten times the number of new veterinarians. In recent years, Party committees and governments at all levels in counties and cities have paid attention to the leadership of old veterinarians. In addition to establishing old veterinary associations and joint veterinary hospitals, training courses and seminars have also been held. Old veterinarians participated in learning and continuously improved their political awareness and technical level. Therefore, old veterinarians in various places actively participated in the prevention and control of livestock epidemics and the breeding and improvement of livestock. In Beizhen, Faku, Tieling, and Zhangwu counties in western Liaoning Province alone, 36 old veterinarians treated more than 5,600 head of mange-affected livestock. Old veterinarians in various places also carried medicine to the countryside and treated livestock diseases for the masses day and night. Of the 48 mating stations established in Faku County last year, 16 were established with the direct participation of local old veterinarians. These stations mated more than 1,200 female animals for the masses. Sixty-five old veterinarians in Nehe County specifically helped 46 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to improve livestock feeding and management.
    The meeting clearly pointed out that although old veterinarians have accumulated a lot of experience in technology, they lack scientific summarization and improvement. Therefore, misdiagnosis and indiscriminate treatment often occur in treatment. Many old veterinarians do not have a sufficient understanding of the spirit of "prevention is more important than treatment". They only care about treatment and do not pay attention to guiding the masses to improve feeding management. Some old veterinarians are also affected by old ideas and have ideas such as "competitors are enemies" and "teaching apprentices starves the master", so they are not united and do not impart very good experience. In addition, a complete organizational system for old veterinarians has not yet been established in leadership. Therefore, the meeting emphasized that in the future, ideological education and organizational leadership for old veterinarians must be strengthened to further stimulate their enthusiasm and overcome some of their negative factors. Old veterinarians should continuously improve their political awareness and technical level, learn from each other in technology, promote the style of respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and actively cultivate a large number of old veterinary talents by means of taking apprentices, so as to further help the masses in livestock feeding management, breeding improvement, and epidemic prevention and treatment under the leadership of the Party and the government.

    东北农业局召开旧兽医代表座谈会
    东北行政委员会农业局，为了充分发挥旧兽医对防治牲畜疫病和促进畜牧业发展的作用，于四月间召开了旧兽医代表座谈会。参加会议的有各省市兽医工作负责干部及旧兽医代表共六十余人。会议总结了几年来旧兽医工作。全区有旧兽医六千五百多人，相当于新兽医的十倍。几年来各县市党委和政府都注意了对旧兽医的领导，除建立旧兽医公会和成立兽医联合医院外，并开办训练班、讲习班等。旧兽医参加了学习，不断提高了政治觉悟和技术水平。因此各地旧兽医积极参加了防治牲畜疫病和繁殖改良牲畜工作。仅辽西省北镇、法库、铁岭、彰武四县三十六名旧兽医就医治了五千六百多匹癞畜。各地旧兽医有的还背药下乡，不分昼夜为群众的牲畜治病。法库县去年建立的四十八处配马站，其中有十六处是在当地旧兽医直接参加下搞起来的。这些站，共为群众交配了一千二百多头母畜。讷河县有六十五名旧兽医具体帮助四十六个农业生产合作社和互助组，改善了牲畜的饲养管理。
    会议明确指出：旧兽医在技术上虽然积累了许多经验，但缺乏科学的总结与提高，因此在治疗中时常发生错治、滥治现象；许多旧兽医对“防重于治”的精神体会得还不够，只管治疗，不注意指导群众改善饲养管理；还有些旧兽医受旧思想影响，存在着“同行是冤家”“教会徒弟饿死师傅”等想法，因而闹不团结，有很好的经验也不传授。另外在领导上对旧兽医还没有建立一套完整的组织系统。因此会议强调指出：今后必须加强对旧兽医的思想教育和组织领导，进一步发挥其积极性，克服其某些消极因素。旧兽医应不断提高政治觉悟，提高技术水平，在技术方面要很好地互教互学，发扬尊师爱徒的作风，以带徒弟的办法，积极培养大量的旧兽医人才，以便进一步在党和政府领导下，帮助群众搞好牲畜饲养管理、繁殖改良和防疫治疗工作。
