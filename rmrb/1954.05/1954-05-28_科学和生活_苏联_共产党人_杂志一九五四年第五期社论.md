Editor's Note: This editorial from "Kommunist" magazine elaborates on how the close connection between science and life is a guarantee of scientific prosperity, and that science should serve the practice of communist construction, promptly answering the most pressing demands of modern life. Starting from the needs of Soviet society, the editorial puts forward the tasks of the Soviet scientific community, criticizes some shortcomings in the connection between theory and practice in the scientific community, and makes pertinent comments on issues such as opposing dogmatism and developing criticism and self-criticism in the scientific community. We are publishing this translation for the reference of our country's scientific community.

Science has never been elevated to such a height or played such a prominent role as it has in the socialist country of the Soviet Union. The socialist society established in our country is a living embodiment of advanced revolutionary scientific thought—Marxist-Leninist thought. The development of socialist society, its gradual transformation into communist society, is realized on the basis of understanding the objective laws of nature and society, and on the basis of the people's conscious utilization of these laws under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Party is the leading and guiding force of the Soviet people, and the policies it implements are based on the science of Marxism-Leninism regarding the laws of social development and the laws of socialist and communist construction. The science of socialist society is the foundation for leading economic and cultural construction and for conducting communist education among the working people. Soviet science helps us to utilize the enormous possibilities inherent in the socialist system and the inexhaustible natural resources of our motherland to further vigorously develop the economy and culture and improve the welfare of the working people.

Under capitalism, science and technology are used to strengthen the exploitation of the working people and enrich the exploiters, and to prepare for new wars. In the Soviet Union, science and technology are the property of the working people, and they are used for the cause of peaceful communist construction and for the welfare of the people. Soviet science does not detach itself from the people; it serves the people loyally. Soviet science is truly democratic science. Socialism has opened up broad paths for the working people to move towards culture and scientific knowledge. In our country, it is not surprising that production innovators and prominent scientists together are opening up new, untrodden paths in science, and that scientists, when solving the boldest tasks, are concerned not only with obtaining important scientific results, but also with applying these results to practice. The strength of Soviet science lies in its inseparable connection with the people and their pressing needs. The creative friendship between science and production that has formed in our country enriches science with advanced experience and helps practical workers to complete their tasks more quickly and better. The achievements of science and technology are widely applied to production and have become an integral part of Soviet life. All this inspires Soviet scientists to achieve new accomplishments in their creative work.

The extremely close connection between science and life, and the extremely close connection between science and the people's struggle to build communism, are guarantees of scientific prosperity. Science can only be true science if it helps practice, listens attentively to practice, and uses practice to verify its conclusions. Practice is the highest criterion of the truthfulness of scientific systems and theories. The organic connection between science and practice has acquired special significance under the conditions of the struggle to build a new society. Emphasizing this point, V.I. Lenin wrote: "...Now everything depends on practice... The historical moment has arrived when theory becomes practice, when theory is revitalized by practice, corrected by practice, and verified by practice..."

Soviet science receives all-round care and constant attention from the Party and the government, and from all the people. All the conditions necessary for the effective creative activities of Soviet scientists have been created. In recent years, the strength of the main scientific center of the country—the Soviet Academy of Sciences—has grown significantly. Several thousand scientific workers are working in the various scientific institutions and branches of the Academy of Sciences. There are now twelve Academies of Sciences in the various Union Republics. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has armed Soviet scientists with the only scientific method and the only scientific theory for understanding natural and social phenomena—dialectical materialism and historical materialism. The Party guides Soviet science to solve the urgent problems raised by the practice of communist construction.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, and with the full support of the Soviet government, our scientists are successfully fulfilling the task of occupying a leading position in the world scientific community. The achievements of Soviet science in obtaining atomic energy brilliantly prove this point. By breaking the United States' monopoly in this area, the power of the Soviet state has been enhanced, and the position of the socialist, peace, and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union in the struggle against the instigators of new wars and for world peace has been further consolidated. Soviet scientists are effectively solving the problem of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. In all branches of scientific knowledge, our scientists have made major achievements with great theoretical and practical significance. The Soviet people feel the creative role of science in the entire economic and cultural life of the country.

The tradition of Soviet science has never been complacency with the achievements it has obtained. In the field of science, as in the entire social life of the Soviet Union, an unwavering rule is at work, and that rule is to evaluate work from the needs of the ever-growing Soviet society and from the tasks of our advancement. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are realizing the program of communist construction, developing the productive forces of our country, improving and consolidating the socialist material and technical base, and raising labor productivity. The task of Soviet scientists is to study extremely important problems in the development of the national economy, synthesize the advanced experience of communist builders, and apply scientific discoveries to production. Our motherland is rich in natural resources; identifying these resources and helping to master them as quickly as possible is the duty of Soviet geographers, geologists, and soil scientists. Workers in technology, physics, and mathematics, and all natural scientists, should actively participate in further research on improving technology in the fields of atomic energy, electrification, radio engineering, production automation, and mechanization.

The most pressing national task at this stage is to fully satisfy the growing needs of our residents for consumer goods within the next two or three years on the basis of the strong development of socialist industrialization, and to ensure the supply of raw materials to light industry and the food industry. The decisions of the September Plenum and the February-March Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee stipulated a specific combat program for accelerating the development of all sectors of agriculture, primarily the development of the grain economy. The realization of this program will drastically improve the material welfare of the working people and take a big step forward on the road to communism. The mission of Soviet science is to play an important role in the completion of this program.

The decisions of the September Plenum and the February-March Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee instructed Soviet scientists to deeply study the urgent problems of agricultural production. This refers first of all to scientists who study biology, agrobiology, agricultural technology, and agricultural economics, and to scientists who study the problems of collective farm land law. Actively promoting the upsurge of agriculture is the patriotic duty of the entire Soviet scientific community. The tasks set by the Party should be completed in the shortest possible time. This means that the high quality of scientific work should be combined with the speed that is commensurate with the current development rate of the national economy. Now, it is of unprecedented importance that science promptly answer the most pressing demands of life.

The example of agricultural science shows how quickly the demands of life grow, and how quickly the practical demands of all branches of scientific knowledge grow. Agricultural science faces very important tasks. It should arm the collective farm members, agricultural machinery stations, and state farm workers with new methods of increasing labor productivity and increasing the amount of products. Scientific institutions, which are charged with the mission of promoting the progress of agricultural science, must seriously study the problems of increasing yields and developing animal husbandry, as well as the economic and organizational problems of agriculture, and the mechanization and electrification of production in collective farms and state farms. In addition to increasing yields, the Party has put forward the task of reclaiming tens of millions of hectares of virgin and fallow land in the next two years. Agricultural science should help to study the ways to operate on the new land.

Our vast territory has various different economic conditions and geological climate conditions. Agricultural science can only successfully solve the tasks it faces by accurately estimating these conditions and carefully studying the experience created by local residents. Attempting to rigidly and dogmatically apply scientific principles in all regions of the country without estimating the economic characteristics and geological climate characteristics of the region has nothing in common with true science and will cause serious damage to the cause. The application of the grass-arable crop rotation system in some regions has exactly achieved the above results.

The February-March Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee exposed the serious errors made by the Soviet State Planning Committee, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms in formulating plans that stipulated the rigid application of the grass-arable crop rotation system. The sowing of perennial pasture grass was expanded without reason, and this pasture grass could only bring very low yields in the arid regions of the south and southeast, while the sowing of grain was reduced without reason. All this extremely adversely affected the development of the grain economy and damaged the interests of the country.

The reason why the rash and uneconomical application of the grass-arable rotation system has gained a fairly wide scope is because it was carried out under the guise of the science respected by the Soviet people, and under the guise of the grass-arable crop rotation system created by Williams. Some students of Williams attempted to prove that the grass-arable crop rotation system could guarantee freedom from all disasters and guarantee bumper harvests in all regions, regardless of geological climate conditions. They were unwilling to consider that Williams mainly studied the central zone of the country, and therefore Williams' conclusions could not be mechanically extended to all regions of the Soviet Union. Instead of creatively applying this theory, they began to turn it into a dogma, rigidly and indiscriminately promoting the grass-arable crop rotation system everywhere, without considering the specific characteristics and practical effects of different regions.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenum sharply criticized the manifestations of dogmatism in agricultural science and emphasized in particular the need to creatively solve scientific tasks and develop science in close connection with the practice of agricultural production. The Plenum paid great attention to the role of science in improving agriculture, which is a new manifestation of the Party's concern for making science as close to life as possible. The Party believes that consolidating the unity of theory and practice, constantly enriching theory with the advanced experience of the masses, and boldly applying scientific achievements to practice are guarantees for developing agricultural science and strengthening its influence on production.

These instructions of the Party are directly related to all branches of scientific knowledge. Soviet science is creative science. It is guided by the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism. Soviet science carefully protects all valuable scientific heritage, but it is not limited to this, and boldly promotes the development of scientific thought according to the urgent needs of life. It is not afraid to strike at things that are declining and stale. It needs creative courage, and creative ideas that have been tested by life and enriched by life. It should become the guide of practice.

V.I. Lenin taught us: "The viewpoint of life and practice should be the primary and fundamental viewpoint of epistemology." This means that only when science is inseparably connected with practice can scientific understanding achieve great achievements and fulfill its creative role in social life. However, social practice is always diverse, and its content is very rich. It is constantly developing in the struggle between the new and the old, it requires in-depth understanding, it raises new questions to science, and it waits for scientists to answer these questions. If science deeply and comprehensively analyzes life, analyzes the contradictions of life, and helps to overcome these contradictions, if science is a searchlight illuminating the path for practice, then science can fulfill its tasks.

Scientific workers in the field of social sciences face serious tasks. Guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, Soviet economists, philosophers, historians, and jurists should study the new phenomena of social life, reveal the laws inherent in socialist society, and study and synthesize the great experience of the Communist Party, the socialist state, and the Soviet people in building communism. They should arm our cadres with the knowledge of these laws and the knowledge of this experience, and boldly study theoretical problems in close connection with life and the practice of communist construction. It is the duty of Soviet scientists to deeply study and synthesize the experience of people's democratic countries and the various processes that occur in capitalist countries and colonies of imperialist powers.

Many of our philosophers, economists, and jurists mainly pay attention to the past in their research, and do not pay attention to modern life or urgent problems. Of course, deeply studying the past from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism can help us to successfully complete our current tasks. However, it is not right to think that the thoughts of scientific leading cadres are only focused on the distant ancient times, while modern problems are only "taken care of" by a small number of people. We must drastically turn scientific institutions to pay attention to the practice of communist construction, to synthesize current experience, and to study the new problems raised by life. It is intolerable that our scientists pay so little attention to the fundamental problems of the development of Soviet society.

Practical life requires philosophers to strengthen the study of the problems of historical materialism in connection with the practice of communist construction. In our philosophical books, up to now, there has been no serious special paper to elaborate on the role of the people as creators of history, to elaborate on the role and significance of the worker-peasant alliance in communist construction, to elaborate on the role of the Party as the leading and guiding force of Soviet society, to elaborate on the contradictions in Soviet society and the ways to overcome these contradictions, and to elaborate on the laws of the development of socialist culture. Philosophers who work in the field of dialectical materialism are actually limited to annotating the principles of Marxist-Leninist classic works. Philosophical problems that have not been well studied have always been outside their vision. Lenin's instruction to study dialectics and logic as comprehensively as studying science has been poorly implemented by our philosophical cadres. More attention should be paid to the problems of ethics and aesthetics. The task of philosophers is also to actively study the philosophical problems of natural science and help natural science workers to master the method of dialectical materialism.

Our economists do not connect theory with practice enough, and they study the new problems raised by life poorly. The Party's newspapers and periodicals have more than once made severe accusations against the Economics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. But until now, the situation has not fundamentally improved. In the works of the Economics Institute, the shortcomings of being divorced from actual life have not been overcome, the various processes that occur in the Soviet economy have not been carefully studied, and new problems have not been creatively solved.

Economists as scientists should focus their attention on the fundamental problems of the economic aspects of socialist industry, agriculture, transportation, and Soviet commerce. The scientific research work on the laws of socialist economics and the principles of socialist management can only be effective and beneficial to practice when it focuses on studying the various processes that occur in our reality. The main difficulty experienced by practitioners lies in understanding how general socialist principles work within a given scope of economic activity and how to ensure the thorough implementation of these principles. Problems such as improving labor productivity, reducing product costs, comprehensive mechanization, improving labor organization, wages, and thoroughly implementing the principle of material interests must be scientifically solved. All this helps to discover and utilize the inexhaustible resources of the national economy to serve the people and the country.

Research on the most important problems in the field of agricultural economics should be strengthened. Up to now, our scientists, for example, have not written a decent book that analyzes the economic activities of the merged collective farms, analyzes the coordination of various sectors in these farms, and analyzes the growing guiding role of agricultural machinery stations in collective farm production. In the study of agricultural economic problems, rigid methods are often used, and the characteristics of districts and states are very poorly considered.

Science that develops in close connection with social practice fully exerts its creativity and strongly influences the process of social development. Conversely, theories that are divorced from practice and divorced from the urgent problems of the present age will deplete the creative power of science and dogmatically rigidify scientific ideas. The dogmatic method is that when scientists solve a problem, they do not start from life, but from citations, and they try to force life into the framework of ready-made formulas, without considering whether the old formulas are adapted to the new content of the social development process. The dogmatist clings to "yesterday's theory" because he lags behind life and cannot see the needs of life. Dogmatism is the most terrible manifestation of stagnation and backwardness in science. Therefore, resolutely fighting against dogmatism has become the most important condition for the creative development of science in close connection with the practice of communist construction.

Dogmatism has taken deep roots in our social sciences. Its manifestations are diverse, but the root cause of these manifestations is the violation of the principle of the organic unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice. Strengthening the connection between theory and actual life by all means is the best way to oppose dogmatism.

Many books can be cited, which do not make deep and comprehensive research on problems, do not make theoretical synthesis of practice, but only repeat "old-fashioned" and repeat formulas that are divorced from concrete historical reality. Who needs such books? No one needs them. Lenin pointed out that attempting to find answers to concrete problems in the simple logical development of general truths is to vulgarize Marxism and to mock dialectical materialism.

Marxism-Leninism teaches us that there are no abstract truths that are applicable to all conditions and times, and that truth is always concrete. Every phenomenon can only be correctly understood when it is linked to the concrete conditions of place and time. Therefore, certain Marxist principles should not be examined abstractly, but should be examined in connection with the historical period to which these principles refer. Another attitude, which is to mechanically apply Marxist principles to any historical period, contains serious errors.

When studying the phenomena of social life, scientific workers should follow the important principles of Marxism-Leninism. But these principles must be applied creatively, not dogmatically. Concrete research on problems and concrete scientific arguments cannot be replaced merely by some casually grabbed and poorly understood citations. However, this attitude of solving scientific problems still exists. For example, individual historians attempt to solve the question of whether the bourgeois nations in Central Asia had already formed before the October Revolution, not by analyzing concrete history, but only
 "according to" one or two paragraphs in the works of Marxist-Leninist classic writers that did not specifically study this question. These historians, because they use this kind of method to carry out their work, not only cannot recognize the problem themselves, but also block the road for other scientific workers to concretely study the historical process, and prompt them to establish utopian formulas and refuse to analyze concrete historical facts.

Abstract logical formalism hinders some of our scientists from clearly observing life and deeply understanding the living reality of socialist society. Taking the works of some jurists as an example, it can be seen from them that there are still so many impractical arguments in jurisprudence, and so little real knowledge of life. For example, experts in collective farm law replace the real study of collective farm legal relations with fabricated impractical disputes. The urgent problems of collective farm law—for example, the legal relations between agricultural machinery stations and collective farms, the legal basis for adjusting collective farm labor, the legal problems of encouraging and rewarding advanced producers, and many other problems—are always outside their attention. Experts in labor law have not seriously studied the labor relations in agricultural machinery stations and collective farms, so these problems are not included in the textbooks on labor law (authors En. Ge. Aleksandrov and A. Ye. Bashylstornik) and the textbooks on collective farm law (editors En. De. Kachazov and A. A. Ruskal). In the jurisprudence books, there is completely no elaboration on the problem of labor organization and the problem of legal adjustment of labor in state farms. In the Soviet Civil Law textbook (editors De. Mu. Gainkin and S. En. Bratus), there is completely no research on the legal problems related to the state procurement system, the state purchasing system, and the ordering contract system for agricultural products, as well as the problems related to Soviet trade organizations and even collective farm trade organizations. It is necessary to determine the legal problems related to improving the role of collective farm chairmen, work team leaders, and farm managers. For example, up to now, confusion has occurred in stipulating the administrative and material responsibilities of this kind of staff; in the jurisprudence books, they are sometimes regarded as figures who are materially responsible for everything. Some jurists have been justly criticized in a timely manner for deviating from actual life and conducting impractical speculations when raising the problems of crime and responsibility in Soviet law. The study of this kind of problem should be closely linked with the concrete task of consolidating socialist legal discipline under the current conditions.

Not estimating the specific conditions that have been formed, not estimating the stage of development that socialist relations have reached, and only conducting impractical empty arguments will bring great harm to the cause. For example, in our economic books, some erroneous views have not yet been completely overcome, and it is believed that the personal property of collective farm households now seems to be hindering the development of social production. This kind of view can actually only damage the interests of collective farm members and hinder the upsurge of agriculture. Only those who do not understand the Party's policy believe that the existence of personal property of collective farm households, for example, the existence of livestock supplying products as personal property, is a danger to the socialist system. Of course, here we are referring to personal property within the standard scope stipulated by the regulations of agricultural labor combinations——this point should be emphasized, because some authors "forget" that improving the social production of collective farms was and still is the main way to drastically improve agriculture.

The works of Soviet scientists should solve practical problems theoretically and help the Party, the Soviet government, and our cadres in solving practical problems. And in order to achieve this goal, scientists should study actual life and study actual life deeply and comprehensively from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism.

We cannot only look at superficial phenomena, and not analyze the living reality. Everyone knows that there are many manuscripts sent to our publishing bureau that are just piles of crude, unprocessed factual materials. It is particularly bad that some of these works have been printed. Many degree theses are also written in the same way, and they have received the fate they deserve and are buried forever in the archives. Sometimes works are published, in which the author only cites some figures and facts, but does not analyze them, and is only limited to the most general superficial evaluations and conclusions. For example, this is the case with several articles by A. Mu. Alekseev in the collection of essays "The Problem of the General Crisis of Capitalism," which he edited and published.

To reduce the whole thing to merely citing facts in order to illustrate certain theoretical principles is to understand the connection between theory and practice too simplistically. The task of scientific workers is not to simply register facts, but to improve from simply observing phenomena to understanding their inherent regular connections, and to improve to theoretical synthesis based on a comprehensive and in-depth study of actual life.

To creatively apply and develop theory, one must understand theory, one must firmly stand on the principled position of Marxism-Leninism, understand the essence of Marxism-Leninism, and master the dialectical-materialistic method. Only in this case can the researcher take the correct road and answer the demands of practice. The phenomenon of individual scientific workers attempting to revise certain major principles of Marxism-Leninism under the pretext of fighting dogmatism is an intolerable phenomenon. We must strictly protect the purity of Marxist-Leninist principles and resolutely oppose any attempt to vulgarize and distort Marxist-Leninist theory.

We cannot ignore the fact that the fundamental principles of Marxist theory are being written off in some magazine articles. For example, this phenomenon occurred in the article "The Welfare of the People" (New World Magazine, 1953, Issue 11) written by La. Mstislavsky. The author of this article believes that up to now it is incorrect to regard value as the consumption of social labor in material production. According to him, value is also determined by the utility of things. In this way, the author confuses the question that Marxists have already made clear and without dispute, Marxists believe that the value of a commodity is determined by the social labor consumed in producing the commodity, while the utility of the commodity constitutes the use value of the commodity.

In the struggle against dogmatism, vulgarization, and other malpractices in science, and in the struggle to creatively study scientific problems and consolidate the connection between science and life, the Communist Party attaches great importance to scientific criticism and self-criticism, attaches great importance to the development of free discussion of theoretical problems, and attaches great importance to debate and creative competition. The Party guides and utilizes scientific criticism to expose bourgeois ideology, to overcome old views that have been overturned by life, and to serve the ever-forward development of Soviet science, which is inseparably linked with practice. The mission of scientific criticism is to help check the correctness of theoretical principles with practical materials, to assist in implementing these principles in accordance with new conditions and new demands of social life, and to add necessary refinements to these principles. Criticism can help science to liberate itself from the pressure of pseudoscientific, dogmatic, and vulgarized positions.

The experience of the widespread debates conducted in various branches of knowledge in recent years has proved that the free struggle of various opinions has great significance for the progress of science. These debates helped to consolidate the materialistic principles in science, overcome outdated anti-scientific views, and further strengthen the connection between science and life. They promoted the development of scientific criticism and mobilized scientific cadres and scientists who attempted to establish a monopoly in the scientific community to fight against the warlord system fostered in some scientific institutions.

The work that has begun must continue. The facts show that the attempts of individual scientists to monopolize science have not yet been completely overcome everywhere. The result of monopolizing science is to replace the creative discussion of problems with administrative means, to exclude people with different opinions, and to suppress lively scientific ideas. For example, this situation occurred in the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences. It is necessary to create a truly creative environment for scientific activities, and it is necessary to guarantee the conditions for developing scientific criticism in all links of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and in all scientific institutions in our country.

On the road of developing scientific criticism, scientific administrative personnel are creating various kinds of obstacles. Some people who worship scientific authority are extremely opposed to any criticism from people with different opinions.

An article by I. V. Turpin was published in an issue of "Journal of Botany," in which some views of T. D. Lysenko on the question of species formation were criticized. These views of Lysenko have not undergone a wide discussion, although it is necessary to discuss these views. However, "Achievements of Modern Botany" magazine and "General Botany Magazine" published articles by A. En. Stukitsky and En. I. Ruzhkin, in which they did not discuss the problems raised by Comrade Turpin in a down-to-earth manner, but put the labels of Weismann-Morganist, vulgarizer of Marxism-Leninism, and so on on Turpin. Comrade Turpin sent several letters to the editorial departments of these magazines, in which he replied to these attacks, but these letters were not published. It is difficult to explain this kind of method other than as an attempt to suppress criticism.

Those who suppress criticism in scientific work harm science and should be countered in a timely manner. Those who use any criticism of a book in the press to "review" and slander the author of the book and to
 "deny" that he is a Marxist also hinder scientific work. In some places, things have even come to the point of using administrative penalties for "erroneous" authors. There are still some people in the scientific community who do not study new problems themselves, but only specialize in finding other people's mistakes, and finding the mistakes of those who attempt to independently study new problems on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

Only in an environment of free and down-to-earth discussion, and in an environment of comradely debate and creative competition, can science be promoted forward. Every branch of knowledge has its own problems that have not been solved, are still in dispute, and need to be fully discussed. But if only the supporters of the views of those who occupy administrative positions in scientific institutions are attracted to participate in the debates, while scientists with different views are excluded and cannot participate in the exchange of opinions, then will the discussion of these problems be effective? To correctly organize debates is to attract representatives of various views to participate in the debates, to allow them to freely express their opinions on the problems being discussed, and to also guarantee that the debates are widely clarified in the press.

Wide debates are not the only form of conducting criticism in science. The meetings of the academic committees should also become a forum for scientific criticism. The academic committee is an organ of collective scientific thought. These committees play an important role in consolidating the connection between science and life because they formulate the topics of scientific work, supervise the process of scientific research, and check and evaluate the results of scientific research. The academic committees can only successfully take on these tasks under the conditions of free exchange of opinions and the wide and unhindered development of scientific criticism. Daily critical discussions of current scientific work should also be conducted in the laboratories; the famous Pavlov "Wednesday" is an irrefutable argument for the form that is conducive to this exchange of opinions. The struggle of various opinions and criticism and self-criticism should be deeply embodied in any stage of scientific work.

The Soviet socialist system has created the possibility of organizing scientific work in a planned way nationwide. This is one of the most important superiorities of Soviet science over bourgeois science. Using this possibility allows us to concentrate a large number of scientific forces and funds to solve the extremely large central tasks proposed by the practice of communist construction and the interests of consolidating the strength of our motherland, and allows us to successfully take on these tasks, no matter how complex or difficult they are. In order to consolidate the connection between science and life, it is necessary to constantly improve the planning of scientific work and improve the coordination of the activities of various scientific institutions. In recent years, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has accumulated some experience in coordinating the activities of various scientific institutions of the Academy of Sciences. The committees for coordinating scientific activities of the Academies of Sciences of the various Union Republics have been established, and coordination meetings on the most important scientific problems related to the basic tasks of developing the national economy and culture have been held. However, the coordination work still needs to be further improved. For example, the coordination committees sometimes disperse their attention and strength to too many problems, do not distinguish the main central problems, and do not conduct constant supervision of the implementation of their suggestions.

One of the most important tasks of scientific institutions, ministries, and departments is to organize the rapid application of scientific achievements to the practice of industrial and agricultural production. It is intolerable that scientific achievements are not applied for a long time. For example, the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has researched a very valuable agent for preventing potatoes from rotting during long-term storage, and has researched the methods for using this agent. This invention has great significance. However, the Soviet Ministry of Chemical Industry has not taken the necessary measures to manufacture this agent to the required quantity. Scientific achievements are still rarely applied to agriculture.

It is necessary to improve the plan for adopting scientific achievements, establish strict supervision of the degree of implementation of the plan, and improve the sense of responsibility and interest of scientific and production workers in rapidly promoting the results of scientific research. Now it is necessary to solve the problems related to consolidating and expanding the necessary material and technical bases and correctly organizing the work of checking and adopting scientific achievements in the national economy.

Correctly arranging scientific institutions is of considerable importance for the connection between science and production. Scientific institutions should be close to production. The February-March Plenum of the Party Central Committee cited the fact that agricultural scientific institutions were not correctly arranged. For example, the Beet Operation Scientific Research Institute is located in the suburbs of Moscow, although everyone knows that beets are mainly planted in the southern regions of Ukraine and the Central Black Earth Zone. The Beekeeping Research Institute is also located in the suburbs of Moscow. The Volatile Oil Crop Scientific Research Institute is located in Moscow—hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from the areas where this crop is concentrated. The interests of the work require eliminating this abnormal phenomenon. Agricultural scientific research institutes and agricultural experimental stations should be located where the crops studied by these agricultural scientific research institutes or agricultural experimental stations are planted.

Some scientific workers almost regard the geographical proximity of scientific institutions to large cultural centers as the most important condition for scientific progress. The facts refute this strange prejudice. Many outstanding scientific inventions belong to scientists in places far away from the center. For true scientists, the source of creative inspiration is the connection with practice and the connection with production. Some pseudo-scientists and various scientific lazy people use this prejudice that they cannot develop science if they leave the center to speculate and trade, and they sacrifice the interests of science and the country to satisfy their personal selfish interests.

With the growth of the demands put forward by Soviet society for science, the sense of responsibility of scientific cadres is also increasing, because they should hold high the banner of advanced Soviet science in the struggle to complete the great tasks of communist construction. Scientists are required to deeply understand the importance of these tasks, to recognize the interests of the people and the nation, and to be good at creatively solving scientific problems.

The vast majority of Soviet scientists loyally and selflessly serve the motherland and serve the people. But some people who have nothing to do with science sometimes appear in the friendly big family of Soviet scientists. The example of Comrade Dimitriev, which was cited by the February-March Plenum of the Party Central Committee, is very educational in this regard. When he worked in the Soviet State Planning Committee, he brought a lot of harm to the cause of developing agriculture; he actively advocated the adoption of the crop rotation system in areas where it would only harm the economy. After Comrade Dimitriev failed in his practical work, he entered the doctoral student academy of the Academy of Sciences, attempting to obtain a doctorate in biology, although his relationship with biology was extremely distant.

The liberalism of individual scientists has helped to a considerable extent those who are not useful for scientific work to infiltrate into the scientific community. They forget the interests of science and the country and support those who are not capable of doing scientific work but attempt to obtain degrees. These scientists often excessively praise the degree theses that cannot meet the basic requirements of science when they speak as opponents in discussing degree theses. Sometimes they use every means to "drag" those who are not good at and cannot write degree theses into the scientific community, and help them and write degree theses for them. These facts should be eliminated now.

In the scientific institutions, it is also possible to encounter people who have not provided any scientific products for several years; they cling to science and live off the juices of science like parasites. There is no reason to keep those who are not capable of doing scientific work, are unwilling to work loyally, and do not bring benefits in the scientific institutions. Science cannot be a refuge for idlers.

Soviet science is developing straight ahead and increasing its connection with life, because it is based on the union of older scientists and scientific youth, and constantly replenishes itself with new and vigorous forces. One of the urgent tasks is to improve the work of training scientific cadres. There are many shortcomings in this regard. For example, this can be seen from the example of training agricultural scientific cadres. In the Economics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, from 1952 to 1953, only four of the twenty-four people who took the doctoral degree examination wrote their theses on the socialist agricultural economy. The degree theses prepared by the pre-doctoral and postgraduate students of the Soviet Academy of Sciences that elaborate on the problems related to agriculture are, in terms of their materials, largely inconsistent with the needs of agriculture. The work of the various Union Republics in training agricultural scientific cadres is unsatisfactory.

The existence of many scientific institutions in various places obliges the local party organs to do a lot of work. Supervising the activities of these institutions and giving them assistance—this is an important responsibility of the Party Committee.

It should be pointed out that in recent times, the local Party organs have strengthened their attention to the activities of scientific institutions. The establishment of the Science and Culture Department by the Party Central Committees of the various Union Republics and many Border District Party Committees and State Party Committees has helped to a considerable extent in this regard. But in order to make the local scientific institutions pay attention to solving urgent problems, for example, to make them close to agricultural production, a lot of work still needs to be done. The scientific personnel must be more closely linked with the production of collective farms and state farms, and the creative friendship between scientific workers and advanced agricultural workers must be improved in the study of concrete problems in developing agriculture and animal husbandry. The Party organs cannot, as is sometimes the case, only be limited to the organizational aspects of the activities of scientific institutions. The Party organs should go deep into the essence of this activity.

Strengthening the connection between science and life and improving the level of the entire scientific work are important conditions for victoriously realizing the program formulated by the Communist Party to improve social production and culture, improve the material welfare of the people, and build communism in our country.

    科学和生活
    ——苏联“共产党人”杂志一九五四年第五期社论
    编者按：“共产党人”杂志的这篇社论，阐述了科学和生活的紧密联系是科学繁荣的保证，科学应当为共产主义建设的实践服务，及时回答现代生活中最迫切的要求。社论从苏联社会的需要出发，提出了苏联科学界的任务，批评了科学界在理论和实际联系方面的一些缺点，对反对教条主义和展开科学界的批评与自我批评等问题，作了中肯的评论。现将这篇社论译出发表，以供我国科学界学习的参考。
    科学在任何时候和任何地方都没有像在社会主义国家苏联被提到这样的高度和起着这样卓越的作用。在我国建立的社会主义社会是先进的革命科学思想——马克思列宁主义思想活生生的体现。社会主义社会的发展，它之逐步转变为共产主义社会，是在认识自然和社会客观法则的基础上、在人民群众在共产党领导下自觉地利用这些法则的基础上实现的。党是苏联人民的领导力量和指导力量，它所执行的政策是以马克思列宁主义关于社会发展法则、关于社会主义和共产主义建设法则的科学为基础的。社会主义社会的科学是领导经济建设和文化建设的基础，是向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的基础。苏联科学帮助我们去利用社会主义制度所固有的巨大可能性，利用我们祖国无穷尽的天然宝藏，来进一步强有力地发展经济和文化，提高劳动人民的福利。
    在资本主义条件下，科学和技术被利用来加强对劳动人民的剥削和使剥削者大发横财，被利用来准备新的战争，至于在苏联，科学和技术是劳动人民的财产，它们被用到和平的共产主义建设事业上，用到人民的福利上。苏联的科学是不脱离人民的，是忠心耿耿地为人民服务的。苏联的科学是真正民主的科学。社会主义为劳动人民开辟了走向文化和科学知识的广阔道路。在我国，毫不足怪，生产革新者和著名科学家一起，在科学中开辟着新的没人走过的道路，而科学家在解决最大胆的任务时，他们所关心的不仅是获得重要的科学成果，而且是把这一成果运用到实践中去。苏联科学的力量就在于和人民及其迫切需要有不可分割的联系。在我国形成的科学和生产的创造性的友谊关系，以先进的经验丰富着科学，并帮助实际工作者更快和更好地完成他们所面临的任务。科学和技术的成就广泛地被运用到生产中，而且成为苏联人生活的一个组成部分。所有这一切鼓舞着苏联科学家在创造性的工作中取得新的成就。
    科学与生活极紧密的联系，科学与人民为建成共产主义而斗争的实践极紧密的联系，是科学繁荣的保证。科学只有帮助实践、注意地倾听实践、用实践来检查自己的结论，才能是真正的科学。实践是科学体系和理论的真实性的最高标准。科学和实践的有机联系，在为建成新社会而斗争的条件下获得了特殊的意义。弗·伊·列宁在强调这一点时写道：“……现在一切事情都在于实践。……已经到来了这样的历史时机：理论成为实践，理论被实践振兴，被实践纠正，被实践检查……”
    苏联的科学在各方面都受到党和政府、全体人民的关怀和经常照顾。苏联科学家有成效的创造性的活动所必需的一切条件都已创造好了。最近几年来全国主要的科学中心——苏联科学院的力量有了显著的增长。在科学院各科学机关里和科学院各分院里，有好几千科学工作人员在劳动着。现在各加盟共和国有十二个科学院。苏联共产党以认识自然现象和社会现象的唯一科学的方法和唯一科学的理论——辩证唯物论和历史唯物论——武装了苏联的科学家。党指导苏联科学去解决共产主义建设实践所提出的迫切问题。
    在共产党的领导下，由于苏联政府全力的支持，我们的科学家顺利地完成着这一任务——在世界科学界中占首要的地位。苏联科学在取得原子能方面所达到的成就辉煌地证明了这一点。由于打垮了美国在这方面的垄断，苏联国家的威力增强了，以苏联为首的社会主义、和平、民主阵营在反对新战争挑拨者、争取全世界和平的斗争中的阵地更加巩固了。苏联科学家有成效地解决着把原子能用于和平目的的问题。在科学知识的各个部门中，我们的科学家都取得了具有巨大理论和实践意义的重大成就。苏联人感觉到科学在全国整个经济和文化生活中的创造作用。
    苏联科学的传统从未以获得的成就而自满。在科学领域中，正如在苏联整个社会生活中一样，有一条确定不移的规则在起着作用，这一条规则就是：从日益增长着的苏联社会的需要出发，从我们前进的任务出发，来评价工作。苏联人民在共产党的领导下实现着共产主义建设的纲领，发展我们国家的生产力，改善和巩固社会主义的物质技术基础，提高劳动生产率。苏联科学家的任务是研究发展国民经济的极重要问题，综合共产主义建设者的先进经验，把科学上的发现运用于生产中。我们的祖国富有自然资源；查明这些资源，并帮助最快地掌握这些资源，是苏联地理学家、地质学家和土壤学家的义务。技术、物理和数学的工作者，一切自然科学的工作者，应当积极地参加进一步研究在原子能、电气化、无线电工程、生产自动化和机械化方面改进技术的问题。
    现阶段最迫切的全民任务，就是在社会主义工业化强大发展的基础上在最近两三年内充分满足我国居民对消费品的日益增长的需要，并保证以原料供应轻工业和食品工业。在苏共中央九月全会和二—三月全会的决定中，规定了加速发展农业一切部门、首先是发展谷物经济的具体的战斗纲领。实现这一纲领，就能急剧地提高劳动人民的物质福利，在走向共产主义的道路上向前迈进一大步。苏联科学的使命是在完成这一纲领上起重要的作用。
    苏共中央九月全会和二—三月全会的决定，指示苏联科学家去深刻地研究农业生产的迫切问题。这首先是指研究生物学、农艺生物学、农业技术和农业经济问题的科学家，指研究集体农庄土地法问题的科学家而言的。积极地促进农业的高涨，是苏联整个科学界爱国主义的义务。党所规定的任务，应当在最短期间完成。这就是说，科学工作高度的质量应当同那与国民经济当前发展速度相适应的速度配合起来。现在，空前重要的是科学要及时地回答生活中最迫切的要求。
    在农业科学的例子上，可以看出生活的要求增长得多么快，一切科学知识部门实践的要求增长得多么快。农业科学面临着非常重要的任务。它应当用提高劳动生产率和提高产品量的新方法来武装集体农庄庄员、农业机器站和国营农场的工作人员。必须使负有推动农业科学前进的使命的科学机关严肃地研究提高收获量和发展畜牧业的问题，以及同样地研究农业的经济和组织问题、集体农庄和国营农场的生产机械化和电气化问题。除了提高收获量以外，党提出了在最近两年内开垦若干万公顷生荒地和熟荒地的任务。农业科学应当帮助研究在新土地上进行经营的方式。
    我国辽阔的国土有着各种不同的经济条件和地质气候条件。农业科学只有精确地估计这些条件，仔细地研究当地居民所创造的经验，才能够顺利地解决它所面临的任务。企图死板地、教条式地在国内一切地区运用科学原理，而不估计该地的经济特点和地质气候特点，这和真正的科学没有什么共同之处，并且会给事业带来严重的损害。在某些地区运用草田农作制，正好获得了上述的结果。
    苏共中央二—三月全会揭露了苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部在制定计划中规定死板地运用草田农作制而犯的严重错误。毫无理由地扩大了多年牧草的播种，而这种牧草在南部和东南部干旱地区只能带来很低的收成，同时又毫无理由地缩减了谷物的播种。所有这一切极端不良地影响了谷物经济的发展，给国家的利益带来了损害。
    轻率地、不经济地运用草田轮作制之所以获得了相当广泛的范围，是因为这是在苏联人所尊敬的科学的幌子下，在威廉姆斯所创造的草田农作制的幌子下进行的。威廉姆斯的一些学生企图证明，草田农作制能保证摆脱一切灾难，而且在一切地区，不管地质气候条件如何，都能保证丰收。他们不愿意考虑，威廉姆斯研究的主要是国家的中部地带，因而不可把威廉姆斯的结论机械地推广到苏联的一切地区。不去创造性地运用这个学说，而开始把它变成教条，死板地、不分皂白地在各处推行草田农作制，不考虑不同区域的具体特点和实际效果。
    苏共中央全会对农业科学中教条主义的表现进行了尖锐的批判，特别有力地强调了必须创造性地解决科学任务，必须和农业生产的实践密切联系地来发展科学。全会对科学在提高农业方面的作用给予了巨大的注意，这是党关怀使科学尽量和生活接近的新的表现。党认为巩固理论和实践的统一、经常以群众的先进经验来丰富理论、大胆地把科学成果运用到实践中，是发展农业科学、加强它对生产的影响的保证。
    党的这些指示是和科学知识的一切部门有直接关系的。苏联科学是创造性的科学。它以马克思列宁主义的理论和方法为指南。苏联科学细心地保护着一切有价值的科学遗产，但是它并不只限于此，而且按照生活的迫切需要大胆地推进科学思想的发展。它不怕打击衰亡和陈腐的东西。它需要创造性的勇敢精神，需要经过生活考验并为生活所丰富了的创造性的思想。它应当成为实践的指导者。
    弗·伊·列宁教导我们说：“生活、实践的观点应该是认识论的首先的和基本的观点”。这就是说，只有当科学和实践不可分割地联系着的时候，科学的认识才能大有成就，才能完成自己在社会生活中的创造性的作用。然而社会实践始终是多种多样的，它的内容是很丰富的。它在新与旧的斗争中不断地发展着，它要求深入的认识，它在科学面前提出新问题，等待科学家来回答这些问题。如果科学深刻地和全面地分析生活，分析生活的矛盾，帮助克服这些矛盾，如果科学是为实践照耀道路的探照灯，那末科学就能担负起自己的任务了。
    社会科学方面的科学工作者面临着严重的任务。苏联的经济学家、哲学家、历史学家、法学家以马克思列宁主义理论为指南，应当研究社会生活的新现象，揭示社会主义社会所固有的规律性，研究和综合共产党、社会主义国家和苏联人民建设共产主义的巨大经验。他们应该用这些规律性的知识和这一经验的知识来武装我们的干部，大胆地紧密联系着生活、联系着共产主义建设实践来研究理论问题。苏联科学家的义务是深刻地研究和综合人民民主国家的经验以及资本主义国家和帝国主义列强殖民地所发生的各种过程。
    我们很多的哲学家、经济学家和法学家在自己的研究中主要只注意过去，而不注意现代生活，不注意迫切的问题。当然，从马克思列宁主义的立场深刻地研究过去是能帮助我们顺利地完成当前任务的。但是不可认为科学领导干部的思想只集中于遥远的古代、而现代问题只让一小部分人来“包办”的这种情况是正当的。必须急剧地扭转科学机关，使之注意共产主义建设的实践，使之综合现时的经验，研究生活所提出的新问题。我们的科学家很少注意苏联社会发展的根本问题，这种情况是不能容忍的。
    实际生活要求哲学家加强和共产主义建设实践相联系地来研究历史唯物论问题。在我们的哲学书籍中，一直到现在，还没有严肃的专门论文来阐述人民之作为历史创造者的作用，阐述工农联盟在共产主义建设中的作用和意义，阐述党之作为苏联社会的领导力量和指导力量的作用，阐述苏联社会中的矛盾和克服这些矛盾的途径，阐述社会主义文化发展的规律性。在辩证唯物论方面工作的哲学家，实际上只局限于注释马克思列宁主义经典著作的原理。未经很好研究过的哲学问题，始终是在他们的视野之外。列宁的关于像研究科学一样全面地研究辩证法和逻辑学的指示，被我们的哲学干部执行得很差。应该更多地注意伦理学和美学的问题。哲学家的任务同样是积极地研究自然科学的哲学问题，帮助自然科学工作者掌握辩证唯物论的方法。
    我们的经济学家把理论和实践联系得不够，对生活提出的新问题研究得很差。党的报刊不只一次地向苏联科学院经济研究所提出了严厉的责备。但是直到现在情况根本上没有好转。在经济研究所的著作中，还没有克服脱离实际生活的缺点，没有细心地研究苏联经济中所发生的各个过程，没有创造性地解决新问题。
    作为科学家的经济学家，应当集中注意社会主义工业、农业、运输业、苏联商业的经济方面的根本问题。社会主义经济法则和社会主义经营原则的科学研究工作，只有在集中研究我国现实中所发生的各种过程时，才能是有成效的，对于实践是有益的。实践工作者所经历的主要困难，是在于了解社会主义一般原则如何在既定经济活动范围内起作用，了解如何保证把这些原则彻底实现。必须科学地解决提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本、综合机械化、改善劳动组织、工资、彻底实现物质利益原则等问题。所有这一切都帮助发现和利用国民经济无穷尽的资源来为人民和国家服务。
    应当加强研究农业经济方面最重要的问题。直到现在，我们的科学家，比方说，还没有写出一本像样的著作，分析合并起来的集体农庄的经济活动，分析这些农庄中各个部门的配合以及农业机器站在集体农庄生产方面的日益增长的指导作用。在研究农业经济问题方面，常常使用死板的方法，对区和州的特点考虑得非常不够。
    在和社会实践紧密联系中发展起来的科学，完全发挥着自己的创造力，强有力地影响着社会发展的进程。相反地，脱离实践、脱离当代迫切问题的理论，会耗损科学的创造力量，会把科学思想教条式地僵化起来。教条主义的方法就是：科学家在解决某一问题时，不是从生活出发，而是从引证出发，力图把生活硬塞到现成公式的框子中，毫不考虑旧公式是否适应于社会发展过程的新内容。教条主义者之所以死抓住“昨天的理论”，是因为他落后于生活，看不见生活的需求。教条主义是科学中停滞和落后的最可怕的表现。因此，坚决地和教条主义作斗争，就成为科学在和共产主义建设实践紧密联系中创造性发展的最重要条件。
    教条主义在我们的社会科学中扎下了很深的根子。它的表现是多种多样的，但这些表现的根源是违反马克思列宁主义的理论和实践有机统一的原则。尽一切力量加强理论和实际生活的联系，是反对教条主义最好的方法。
    可以举出不少的书，它们不对问题作深刻和全面的研究，不对实践作理论的综合，只是重复“老生常谈”，重复和具体历史现实脱离的公式。谁需要这样的书呢？谁也不需要。列宁指出道：企图在一般真理的简单的逻辑发展中寻找具体问题的答案，是把马克思主义庸俗化，是对辩证唯物论的嘲笑。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们说，对于一切条件和时间都适用的抽象真理是没有的，真理总是具体的。每个现象只有同地点和时间的具体条件联系起来才可能正确地了解。因此，对于一定的马克思主义原理，不应该抽象地去考察，而应当与这些原理所指的历史时期联系起来去考察。另一种态度，即把马克思主义原理机械地运用于任何历史时期，是包含着严重错误的。
    科学工作者在研究社会生活的现象时，应当遵循马克思列宁主义的重大原理。但是必须创造性地、而不是教条式地运用这些原理。不能仅仅用一些偶尔抓到的和了解得不正确的引证，来代替对问题的具体研究，来代替具体的科学论证。然而这样解决科学问题的态度还是存在的。例如，个别历史学家企图解决十月革命前资产阶级民族在中亚细亚是否已经形成的问题，不去分析具体的历史，而只是
  “根据”马克思列宁主义经典著作家的著作中不是专门研究这个问题的一两段话。这些历史学家，由于使用这类方法进行工作，不仅自己不能认清问题，而且挡住了其他科学工作者具体地研究历史过程的道路，促使他们建立空想的公式和拒绝对具体历史事实进行分析。
    抽象的逻辑的公式主义，阻碍着我国的一些科学家去清楚地观察生活，深刻地理解社会主义社会生动的现实。以某些法律学家的著作做例子，从其中可以看出，在法学中不切合实际的议论还是如此之多，而真正的生活知识却是如此之少。例如，集体农庄法的专家以臆造出来的不切合实际的争论来代替了对集体农庄法律关系的真正研究。集体农庄法律的迫切问题——例如，农业机器站和集体农庄的法律关系，调整集体农庄的劳动的法律基础，鼓励奖赏先进生产者的法律问题以及其他许多问题——始终在他们的注意范围以外。劳动法方面的专家没有严肃地研究农业机器站和集体农庄中的劳动关系，因而在劳动法的教科书（作者恩·格·亚历山大洛夫和阿·耶·巴什尔斯脱尼克）和集体农庄法的教科书（编者恩·德·卡查者夫和阿·阿·鲁斯考尔）中都没有这些问题。在法学书籍中完全没有阐述国营农场中的劳动组织问题和劳动的合法调整问题。在苏联民法教科书（编者德·牟·盖恩金和斯·恩·布拉吐斯）中完全没有研究与农产品的国家征收制、国家采购制和定购合同制有联系的法律问题以及与苏维埃贸易组织乃至集体农庄贸易组织有联系的问题。必须确定与提高集体农庄主席、工作队队长和农场场长的作用有联系的法律问题。例如，到现在为止，在规定这类工作人员的行政和物质责任时，还发生混乱的现象；在法学书籍中有时把他们看成在物质上要对一切负责的人物。某些法律学家由于在提出苏维埃法律中的犯罪和责任问题时脱离实际生活，并进行不切合实际的空论，及时地受到了公正的批判。研究这种问题应该和在当前条件下巩固社会主义法纪的具体任务紧密地联系起来。
    不估计到已形成的具体条件，不估计到社会主义关系已达到的发展阶段，而只进行不切合实际的空泛的议论，这会给事业带来很大的损害。例如，在我们的经济书籍中还没有彻底克服一些错误的观点，认为集体农户的个人财产现在好像已经阻碍了社会生产的发展。这类观点实际上只能损害集体农庄庄员的利益，阻碍农业的高涨。只有不了解党的政策的人才认为，集体农户的个人财产之存在，例如，供应产品的牲畜之作为个人财产而存在，对于社会主义制度是一种危险。当然，这里所指的是农业劳动组合章程所规定的标准范围内的个人财产，——这一点应当着重指出，因为有些作者“忘记了”：提高集体农庄的社会生产过去是而现在仍然是急剧提高农业的主要途径。
    应当使苏联科学家的著作从理论上去解决实际问题，对于党、苏联政府和我们的干部在解决实际问题时有所帮助。而为了达到这个目的，科学家应当研究实际生活，从马克思列宁主义的立场深刻地和全面地研究实际生活。
    不能只看表面现象，而对生动的现实不加分析。大家知道，送到我们出版局来的有不少这样的原稿，它们只是一堆粗糙的未加过工的事实材料。特别不好的是，这样的著作有一些竟刊印了出来。有不少也是用同样方式写成的学位论文，得到了应得的命运，永远埋葬在档案库里。有时出版了这样的作品，作者只引用了一些数字和事实，并没有去分析它们，而只局限于最一般的表面的估价和结论。例如，阿·牟·阿列克赛也夫在论文集“资本主义总危机问题”中的几篇文章就是这样，这本书是他编辑出版的。
    把整个事情归结到仅仅为了例证某些理论原理而才引用事实，这就是把理论与实际的联系了解得太简单化了。科学工作者的任务不是在于简单地登记事实，而是在于从简单地观察现象提高到了解它们的内在的合乎规律的联系，提高到在对实际生活的全面和深刻的研究基础上进行理论的综合。
    要创造性地运用和发展理论，就必须懂得理论，必须坚决地站在马克思列宁主义的原则立场上，理解马克思列宁主义的实质，掌握唯物辩证方法。只有在这种情况下，研究者才能走正确的道路，才能回答实践的要求。个别科学工作者企图在与教条主义斗争的借口下来修改马克思列宁主义的某些重大原理，这是不能容忍的现象。必须严格地保护马克思列宁主义原则的纯洁性，坚决反对把马克思列宁主义理论庸俗化和加以歪曲的任何企图。
    不能忽视某些杂志论文中把马克思主义理论的根本原理加以勾销的事实。例如，在拉·姆斯基斯拉夫斯基所著的“人民的福利”一文（“新世界”杂志，一九五三年，第十一期）中就发生这种现象。该文的作者认为，到现在为止把价值看作物质生产中社会劳动的耗费，是不正确的。据他看来，价值也同样是由事物的效用性来决定。这样一来，作者就使马克思主义者已经清楚的没有争论的问题发生混乱，马克思主义者认为商品的价值是由生产商品时所耗费的社会劳动来决定，而商品的效用性构成商品的使用价值。
    在与科学中的教条主义、庸俗化和其他歪风作斗争中，在为创造性地研究科学问题、为巩固科学和生活的联系而斗争中，共产党非常重视科学的批评和自我批评，非常重视理论问题自由讨论的开展，非常重视辩论以及创造性的竞赛。党指导和利用科学的批评以揭发资产阶级思想，克服已被生活推翻了的旧观点，来服务于与实践不可分割地相联系的苏联科学日益前进的发展。科学的批评的使命是帮助以实践的材料来检查理论原理的正确性，是协助依据新的条件、依据社会生活新的要求把这些原理加以贯彻，并在这些原理中加进必要的精确化。批评能帮助科学从假科学的、教条主义的、庸俗化的立场的重压下解放出来。
    最近几年在各种知识部门中所进行的广泛辩论，其经验证明了各种意见的自由斗争对于科学的进步具有巨大的意义。这些辩论帮助巩固了科学中的唯物主义原则，克服了过时的反科学的观点，进一步加强了科学和生活的联系。它们推动了科学的批评的发展，动员了科学干部和那些企图在科学界中建立一种垄断地位的科学家们在某些科学机关中扶植的军阀制度进行斗争。
    已开始的工作必须继续下去。事实说明了个别科学家想垄断科学的企图还没有在任何地方都已完全克服。垄断科学的结果，就会以行政手段代替创造性地讨论问题，排挤意见不同的人，压制生动的科学思想。例如，在全苏列宁农业科学院中就出现了这种情况。必须为科学活动建立真正创造的环境，必须保证在苏联科学院的一切环节上，在我国一切科学机关内开展科学的批评的条件。
    在开展科学的批评的道路上，科学行政人员制造着各种各样的阻碍。有些崇拜科学权威的人极端反对来自意见不同的人的任何批评。
    在一期“植物学杂志”上刊载了伊·维·杜尔平的一篇文章，在这篇文章中批评了特·德·李森科关于种的形成问题的一些观点。李森科的这些观点没有经过广泛的讨论，虽然讨论这些观点是必要的。然而“现代植物学成就”杂志和“普通植物学杂志”刊载了阿·恩·斯杜基茨基和恩·伊·鲁日金的文章，在这些文章中不是实事求是地讨论杜尔平同志提出的问题，而是给杜尔平戴上了魏斯曼—摩尔根主义者、马克思列宁主义庸俗化者如此等等的帽子。杜尔平同志给这些杂志的编辑部去了几封信，在信中对这些抨击作了答复，但是这些信没有刊载出来。这类方法除了是企图压制批评以外，很难作其他的解释。
    那些在科学工作中压制批评的人，使科学遭受损害，应当受到及时的反击。那些利用报刊上对某本书的任何批评来“审查”和诬蔑该书的作者，来
  “否认”他是马克思主义者的人，也是妨碍科学工作的。有些地方事情甚至于弄到对“犯错误”的作者使用行政的处罚。科学界中还有着这样的一些人，他们自己不研究新问题，而只专门去寻找别人的错误，寻找那些企图在马克思列宁主义基础上独立地研究新问题的人的错误。
    只有在自由的实事求是的讨论的环境里，在同志的辩论、创造性的竞赛的环境里，才能把科学推向前进。每一知识部门都有自己的、没有解决的、还在争论的、需要全面讨论的问题。但是，如果只吸引在科学机关内占有行政职位的人的观点的拥护者来参加辩论，而抱有不同观点的科学家则被排挤，不能参加交换意见，那末，这些问题的讨论是否会有成效呢？正确地组织辩论，就是要吸引各种观点的代表者来参加辩论，让他们能够自由地发表自己对被讨论的问题的意见，而且同样要保证在报刊上对辩论作广泛的阐明。
    广泛的辩论并不是科学中进行批评的唯一形式。应当使学术委员会会议也成为科学批评的讲坛。学术委员会是集体科学思想的机关。这些委员会由于制定科学工作的题目，监督科学研究的过程，检查和评定科学研究的结果，所以在巩固科学和生活的联系方面起着重要的作用。学术委员会只有在自由交换意见的条件下，在广泛地无阻碍地开展科学批评的环境下，才能够顺利地担负起这些任务。应当在实验室内也对当前科学工作进行日常的批评的讨论；有名的巴甫洛夫“星期三”是有利于这种交换意见的形式不可反驳的论据。各种意见的斗争，批评和自我批评，应当深刻体现在任何阶段的科学工作中。
    苏联社会主义制度创造了在全国范围内有计划地组织科学工作的可能性。这就是苏联科学对资产阶级科学的最重要的优越性之一。利用这一可能性，使我们可以集中大批的科学力量和资金来解决共产主义建设的实践和巩固我们祖国实力的利益所提出的极巨大的中心任务，使我们可以顺利地担负起这些任务，不管它们是如何复杂、如何艰巨。为了巩固科学与生活的联系，必须不断地改进科学工作的计划化，改进各科学机关活动的配合。最近几年来苏联科学院在科学院各科学机关活动的配合方面积累了若干经验。成立了各加盟共和国科学院科学活动配合委员会，举行与发展国民经济和文化的基本任务相联系的最重要科学问题的配合会议。然而配合工作还需要进一步的改善。例如，配合委员会有时把注意和力量分散到为数过多的问题上，没有分出主要的中心的问题，没有对自己建议的执行作经常的监督。
    科学的机关、部和署最重要的任务之一，就是组织把科学成就很快地运用到工业和农业生产的实践中去。有时科学成就很久没有被运用，这是不能容忍的现象。例如，苏联科学院植物生理学研究所研究出了一种预防马铃薯在长期储藏时腐坏的很珍贵的药剂，并研究出了使用这种药剂的方法。这一发明具有极大的意义。然而苏联化学工业部却没有采取必要的措施，把这种药剂制造到需要的数量。科学成就还很少应用于农业中。
    必须改善采用科学成就的工作的计划，建立对计划执行程度的严格监督，提高科学和生产的工作人员在极迅速推行科学研究结果方面的责任心和兴趣。现在应当解决那与巩固和扩大必要的物质技术基础以及正确地组织在国民经济中检查和采用科学成就的工作相联系的问题了。
    正确地配置科学机关，对于科学和生产的联系，具有着相当重要的意义。应当使科学机关接近生产。党中央二—三月全会举出了不正确配置农业科学机关的事实。例如，甜菜作业科学研究所位于莫斯科近郊，虽然大家知道甜菜主要种植在乌克兰和中央黑土地带的南部地区。养蜂业研究所也位于莫斯科近郊。挥发油作物科学研究所被安置在莫斯科——离开这种作物集中的地区有几百和几千公里。工作的利益要求消灭这种不正常的现象。农业科学研究所和农业实验场应当位置于种植这些农业科学研究所或农业实验场所研究的作物的地方。
    有些科学工作者几乎把科学机关在地理上接近大文化中心看作科学进步的最重要条件。事实驳斥了这种奇怪的偏见。不少卓越的科学发明是属于远离中心地方的科学家的。对真正的科学家说来，创造的灵感的泉源是与实践的联系，与生产的联系。一些假科学家和各种科学懒汉就利用这个好像离开了中心就不能发展科学的偏见来做投机买卖，他们牺牲科学和国家的利益来满足他们个人的自私的利益。
    随着苏联社会对科学提出的要求的增长，科学干部的责任感也提高着，因为他们应该在争取完成共产主义建设的伟大任务的斗争中高举起先进的苏联科学的旗帜。要求科学家深刻理解这些任务的重要性，认识到全民和全国的利益，善于创造性地解决科学问题。
    苏联科学家绝大多数都是忠诚地和忘我地为祖国服务，为人民服务。但是苏联科学家友爱的大家庭中有时会出现一些和科学完全没有关系的人。苏共中央二—三月全会所举的吉米特里也夫同志的例子，在这方面是很有教育意义的。他在苏联国家计划委员会工作时，给发展农业的事业带来了不少损害；他积极倡导在草田轮作制只会损害经济的那些地区采用这种耕作法。吉米特里也夫同志在实际工作中失败以后，便入科学院的博士生院，企图得到生物学博士的学位，虽然他和生物学的关系是极其疏远的。
    个别科学家的自由主义在不小程度上帮助了那些对科学工作没有用处的人渗入到科学界。他们忘记了科学和国家的利益，支持那些没有能力做科学工作而企图获得学位的人。这些科学家在讨论学位论文时以反对者的身份发言，常常过度夸奖那些不能满足科学起码要求的学位论文。有时用一切办法把那些不善于和不能够写学位论文的人“拖入”科学界，帮助他们，替他们写学位论文。现在应该消灭这样的事实了。
    在科学机关中还可以碰到几年内没有提供任何科学产品的人；他们死咬着科学，像寄生虫一样靠科学的汁液过活。没有任何理由把那些没有能力做科学工作、不愿忠诚地劳动和不带来利益的人留在科学机关里。科学不能是游手好闲者的避难所。
    苏联科学一往直前地发展着，并增加着和生活的联系，因为它是以老年科学家和科学青年的联合为基础，不断地为自己补充新的富有生气的力量。迫切的任务之一是改善训练科学干部的工作。在这方面缺点是不少的。例如，从训练农业科学干部的例子上就看得出这点来。在苏联科学院经济研究所里，从一九五二年到一九五三年，在二十四个受博士学位考试的人中，只有四个人的论文是阐述社会主义农业经济的。苏联科学院的预备考博士学位者与研究生所准备的阐述和农业有关的问题的学位论文，就其取材而论，很多是不合乎农业需要的。各加盟共和国的训练农业科学干部的工作是不能令人满意的。
    各地方很多科学机关的存在，责成地方党机关作许多工作。监督这些机关的活动，给它们以帮助，——这是党委会的重要责任。
    应该指出，在最近时期，地方党机关加强了对科学机关活动的注意。各加盟共和国党中央，许多边疆区党委和州党委之设立科学文化部，在不小程度上是有助于这一点的。但是为了使地方科学机关注意解决迫切的问题，例如使它们接近农业生产，还须要作好多的工作。必须使科学人员同集体农庄和国营农场的生产更紧密地联系起来，搞好科学工作人员和农业先进分子在研究发展农业和牧畜业的具体问题方面的创造性的友谊关系。党的机关不能像有时还发生的情形那样，只局限于科学机关活动的组织方面。党的机关应当深入到这种活动的本质中去。
    加强科学与生活的联系，提高整个科学工作的水平，是胜利地实现共产党所制定的提高社会生产和文化、提高人民的物质福利、在我国建成共产主义的这一纲领的重要条件。
