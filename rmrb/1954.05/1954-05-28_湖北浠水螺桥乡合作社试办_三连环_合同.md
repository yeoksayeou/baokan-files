    Hubei Xishui Luoqiao Township Cooperative Pilots "Three-Ring" Contract
    In order to further expand its business and develop production, the Credit Cooperative of Luoqiao Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, under the leadership of the Party branch, strengthened the economic ties between the three major cooperatives and piloted a "three-ring" business contract with the Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the township.
    The contract was successfully signed in late April. The contract stipulates that the Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative will pre-sell 550 jin of wheat, 1,200 jin of rapeseed, and 5 fat pigs (worth a total of 6.78 million yuan) to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and deposit the funds in the Credit Cooperative, which will pay interest according to regulations. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative will guarantee the supply of 1,000 jin of cottonseed cake, 500 jin of rapeseed cake, 400 jin of superphosphate (chemical fertilizer), 40 jin of gypsum, 200 jin of cooking oil, 300 jin of edible salt, 30 straw hats, 2 bolts of poplin, 1 bolt of mercerized grey cloth, and 3 bolts of white fine cloth (worth a total of 3.9 million yuan) to the Agricultural Production Cooperative according to the needs of the members. When the Agricultural Production Cooperative has insufficient funds, the Credit Cooperative will provide loans to solve the problem.
    After the contract was signed, the Credit Cooperative has absorbed 5.58 million yuan in deposits. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative has begun to supply production and living materials, and the members of the Lighthouse Agricultural Production Cooperative have also formulated production plans, guaranteeing an increase of 15% in total production compared to last year. The members said: "The Supply and Marketing Cooperative handles buying and selling, the Credit Cooperative handles deposits and loans, there is a way out for production, and there is a reliable backing for developing production."
    After the successful signing of the "three-ring" contract in the township, it influenced some mutual aid groups to voluntarily request to sign contracts with the Credit Cooperative and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. (Gao Changren)
