Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 15th: More and more representatives of French people's organizations are arriving in Geneva to express to the delegations of various countries attending the Geneva Conference the sincere desire of the French people to restore peace in Indochina and immediately stop the Indochina War.

    Our delegation received on the 14th representatives from the Ivry district near Paris, the Vitry Peace Committee on the Seine, Dijon, railway workers from Arles and Fourmies-Garenne, the Marseille-Prado railway workers' Committee for the Defense of Peace, the Vitry railway workers' Peace Committee, the French Women's Union of Marseille, and the French Women's Union of the Bouches-du-Rhône department. They presented the Chinese delegation with letters of respect and resolutions from local people's organizations calling for an immediate end to the Indochina War.

    The resolution of the Marseille-Prado Railway Workers' Committee for the Defense of Peace stated that they are authorized to visit the comrades of the Chinese delegation in Geneva and pay their respects to the Chinese representatives and the chief representative of the delegation, Zhou Enlai. The Marseille-Prado railway workers will, together with the entire French nation and the great, glorious Chinese people, strive for the victory of peace and a policy of consultation.

    The Dijon railway workers' resolution stated that the railway workers of Dijon firmly support resolving the issue through consultation instead of force, and support the immediate cessation of the Indochina War. This war, in addition to causing serious damage to the friendship between the French and Vietnamese people, also proves every day that it is the main reason for the severe economic disorder in our lives, and it is creating more and more unemployed. They oppose the attitude taken by the French government, because the French government does not pay attention to the opinions expressed by the majority of people demanding an end to the Vietnam War, but only uses the fresh blood of French youth to support a corrupt regime and the interests of a few speculators who take advantage of this situation to engage in smuggling. Therefore, they demand that the representatives of the French government adopt an attitude that is in line with the opinions of the majority of French people.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 16th: According to TASS, Geneva, May 15th: The Soviet delegation attending the Geneva Conference received on the 14th some delegations from France, including a delegation of family members of French soldiers captured and missing in the Indochina War, as well as representatives of workers from Vitry, residents of Ivry on the Seine, and railway employees from Fourmies-Garenne. These delegations came to Geneva to express the French people's will to strive for the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    The delegation of fifteen people from Vitry included people from all walks of life with different political beliefs: workers, engineers, members of the Socialist Party, members of the Communist Party, and members of the Popular Republican Movement. A member of the delegation, Leon De said: "The French people are deeply disturbed by Bidault's current policy of delaying negotiations." Similar sentiments were expressed in the speeches of other representatives. The Vitry delegation wanted to hand over the statement of the residents of Vitry to the French delegation attending the Geneva Conference, however, the French delegation declined to meet with them on the pretext that members were absent. The delegation left behind the statements and appeals passed by the Vitry Peace Committee, the Vitry Railway Repair Shop Peace Committee, workers of the Deschirons enterprise, and the Vitry French Women's Union, as well as the resolution passed by the Vitry Municipal Workers' Union. All these statements and resolutions given to the delegations of various countries participating in the Geneva Conference, especially the French delegation, demand an immediate end to the Indochina War, and call for the establishment of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and France. The appeal from the Vitry French Women's Union stated: "Pham Van Dong's proposal is in line with the interests of France."

    The delegation of family members of French soldiers captured and missing in the Indochina War gave the Soviet delegation a letter. The delegations of major powers and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also received similar letters. These letters eagerly hope that the representatives of various countries will show sincerity, strive for an immediate ceasefire, and exchange prisoners of war as soon as possible.

    The appeal from the residents of Ivry on the Seine to the chief representative of the French delegation attending the Geneva Conference stated: "We do not desire to escalate the war, nor do we want to expand the war. We desire peace, and we believe that today, peace can still be achieved, peace will end the terrible war, and allow France to maintain its economic and cultural interests in Southeast Asia on the basis of peace. We ask you to listen to our voices and the voices of millions of honest people in France and the world, and we hope that the conference will produce good results."

    The railway employees' delegation left behind a petition signed by 1,300 people. The petition demands that the French government "use the opportunity of the Geneva Conference to immediately achieve a ceasefire in Indochina." The petition states, "Railway employees, like all the French people, demand an end to this war that is bankrupting our country for the benefit of foreign interests."

    法国人民代表访中苏两国代表团
    表示要求恢复印度支那和平的坚决意志
    【新华社日内瓦十五日电】越来越多的法国人民团体的代表来到日内瓦，向出席日内瓦会议的各国代表团表达法国人民要求恢复印度支那和平、立即停止印度支那战争的真诚愿望。
    我国代表团十四日又接见了巴黎近郊伊弗里区、塞纳河上的维特里和平委员会、第戎、阿尔和福里—嘉伦铁路工人、马赛—普拉多铁路工人保卫和平委员会、维特里铁路工人和平委员会、马赛法兰西妇女联盟、罗尼河口省法兰西妇女联盟的代表们。他们向中国代表团递交致敬信及当地人民团体关于立即停止印度支那战争的决议。
    马赛—普拉多铁路工人保卫和平委员会的决议中说，他们受权赴日内瓦访问中国代表团的同志、向中国代表及代表团首席代表周恩来致敬。马赛—普拉多铁路工人将与整个法兰西民族和伟大、光荣的中国人民一起，为和平与协商政策的胜利而奋斗。
    第戎铁路工人的决议说，第戎的铁路工人坚决拥护以协商解决来代替武力解决，赞成立即停止印度支那战争。这个战争除了使法、越两国人民间的友谊遭到严重损害外，而且每天都充分证明它是使我国的生活感受严重经济混乱的主要原因，它还造成了越来越多的失业者。他们反对法国政府采取的态度，因为法国政府毫不重视要求停止越南战争的大多数人民所表示的意见，而只是以法国青年的鲜血来支持一个腐朽政权和几个利用这种局势进行走私的投机者的利益。因此，他们要求法国政府的代表采取符合法国大多数人的意见的态度。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦十五日讯：出席日内瓦会议的苏联代表团于十四日接见了一些来自法国的代表团，其中有在印度支那战争中被俘和失踪的法国军人的家属的代表团以及维特里的职工、塞纳河上伊弗里居民、福里—嘉伦铁路员工代表团。这些代表团来到日内瓦表示法国人民争取恢复印度支那和平的意志。
    从维特里来的十五人代表团，包括有各个阶层、具有不同政治信仰的人：工人、工程师、社会党员、共产党员和人民共和党员。代表团的一个团员李翁德说：“法国人因皮杜尔目前的拖延谈判的政策而深感不安。”其他代表的发言中都有同样的表示。维特里代表团想把维特里居民的声明交给出席日内瓦会议的法国代表团，然而，法国代表团借口团员不在，不接见他们。代表团留下了维特里和平委员会、维特里铁路修配厂和平委员会、德歇隆企业工人和维特里法兰西妇女联盟组织通过的声明和呼吁书以及维特里市政工作者工会通过的决议。所有这些给参加日内瓦会议各国代表团，特别是法国代表团的声明和决议，都要求立即结束印度支那战争，并要求苏联和法国建立友好的关系。维特里法兰西妇女联盟组织的呼吁书说：“范文同的建议是符合于法国的利益的。”
    法国在印度支那战争中被俘和失踪的军人家属的代表团交给苏联代表团一封信。各大国代表团和越南民主共和国代表团也收到了同样的信件。这些信件热烈地希望各国代表表示诚意，争取立即停战和早日交换战俘。
    塞纳河上伊弗里居民给出席日内瓦会议的法国代表团首席代表的呼吁书说：“我们既不渴望加剧战争，也不想扩大战争。我们渴望和平，并且相信：到今天，和平还是能够取得的，和平会结束可怕的战争，使法国能够在和平的基础上维持它在东南亚的经济和文化利益。我们要求你们倾听我们的呼声和法国以及全世界千百万正直人民的呼声，我们希望会议得出良好的结果。”
    铁路员工代表团留下了一份有一千三百人签名的请愿书。请愿书要求法国政府“利用日内瓦会议的机会立即获致印度支那停火。”请愿书说，“铁路员工和全体法国人民一样，要求结束这个为了外国利益而使我们国家破产的战争。”
