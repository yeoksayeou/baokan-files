Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 13th: The Geneva Conference continued its discussion on the Korean issue at 3:00 PM on the 13th.

Prince Wan of Thailand served as chairman of the meeting.

French representative Bidault spoke first. Although the discussion on the Korean issue had already lasted for sixteen days, Bidault decided to join the chorus defending the American aggression against Korea. Bidault said he did not want to repeat history, but then he distorted history, slandering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for starting the war. Since he could not find any factual basis, Bidault even misrepresented the proposal made to the South Korean National Assembly by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the eve of the war launched by the Syngman Rhee clique under American instigation in June 1950, which called for peaceful unification of Korea, as proof that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was preparing for war. Bidault groundlessly insisted that the proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il, which conformed to the basic aspirations of the Korean people, "lacked the minimum guarantees."

Bidault said that he believed the two so-called "basic principles" for the peaceful unification of Korea should be: first, the representation of the Korean people in the "joint institutions to be established" must conform to the "ratio of the number of citizens" in North and South Korea, and this so-called "ratio of the number of citizens" was obviously an excuse to allow the Syngman Rhee clique to control the joint institutions; second, elections should only be considered "valid" when "neutral observers" with "full supervisory powers" confirm that "conditions of freedom of expression" exist. He believed that the United Nations, as one of the belligerents in Korea, was the most "qualified" to appoint these "neutral observers."

Bidault pretended not to understand why people called the United States "imperialist," although interference from across the Atlantic was not unfamiliar to France today. Bidault also attempted to deny the historical trend of Asian peoples striving for national liberation, saying that he did not think it was "outdated" to continue implementing colonial policies in Asia.

British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke next. For many days, Western newspapers had reported that the American delegation was greatly dissatisfied with the silence of the British representatives.

Eden's speech on the 13th began by trying his best to defend the American aggression against Korea. He said that the United States bore the greatest burden in the Korean War and should be "saluted." He particularly opposed the proposal made by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on May 3 regarding the issue of prisoners of war. According to him, this issue had already been resolved as far as the British government was concerned. He described the American forced detention of more than 21,000 captured North Korean and Chinese personnel this January as being in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and the Armistice Agreement. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which included India, a member of the British Commonwealth, pointed out in its "Final Report" that the American release of prisoners of war was illegal. Moreover, Eden deliberately failed to mention the forced detention of more than 27,000 captured North Korean and Chinese personnel by the Syngman Rhee clique with American connivance shortly before the Korean armistice. Regarding this matter, British Prime Minister Churchill had announced in the British House of Commons on June 22, 1953, that the British government had sent a note to the Syngman Rhee government saying, "Her Majesty's Government strongly condemns this... act of betrayal." And General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations Forces," had also promised in his reply to Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai on June 29, 1953: "The United Nations Command is continuing its efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war." The facts were clearly not as Eden said, "already resolved."

Eden defended Britain's policy towards Asia, but the Asian people are well aware of Britain's colonial policies.

Eden stated that he opposed the proposal put forward by North Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il. He groundlessly said that Nam Il's proposal could not lead to the establishment of a single, independent, and democratic government for all of Korea. He acknowledged that there were great differences of opinion at the conference, but he also said that there were many points in common. He said that one should not be disappointed in reaching a solution to the Korean problem.

Then, Eden put forward five principles that he believed must be followed in resolving the Korean issue. These five vague "principles" are: first, the government of all of Korea should be produced by elections; second, the elections should truly reflect the will of the people and take into account the population distribution of North and South Korea; third, the elections should be based on universal adult suffrage and secret ballot, and should be held as quickly as possible under truly free conditions; fourth, the elections should be conducted under the supervision of the United Nations, and the countries participating in the supervision do not necessarily have to be countries that participated in the Korean War, and can be countries agreed upon by this conference; fifth, any plan to resolve the Korean issue must provide conditions for the withdrawal of foreign troops.

Eden advocated holding limited meetings for practical discussions, and reporting to the general assembly as soon as the work is completed.

After Eden finished speaking, no one asked to speak. The chairman announced that the time of the next meeting would be notified separately. The meeting adjourned at 4:10 PM.

### 日内瓦会议十三日继续讨论朝鲜问题

    日内瓦会议十三日继续讨论朝鲜问题
    【新华社日内瓦十三日电】日内瓦会议于十三日下午三时继续进行关于朝鲜问题的讨论。
    泰国代表旺亲王任会议主席。
    法国代表皮杜尔首先发言。虽然关于朝鲜问题的讨论已经过了十六天，皮杜尔还是决定参加替美国侵略朝鲜行为辩护的合唱。皮杜尔说他不愿重复历史，但他接着又歪曲历史，诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动战争。由于实在找不到事实根据，皮杜尔竟把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会在一九五零年六月李承晚集团在美国策动下发动战争的前夕向南朝鲜国会提出的和平统一朝鲜的建议，说成是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国准备战争的证明。皮杜尔毫无理由地硬说南日外务相所提出的符合朝鲜人民基本愿望的建议“缺乏最低限度的保证”。
    皮杜尔说，他认为和平统一朝鲜的两个所谓“基本原则”应该是：一、朝鲜人民在“将予建立的共同机构”里的代表，必须符合南北朝鲜“公民数目的比例”，而这个所谓“公民数目的比例”显然是为了使李承晚集团能控制共同机构的借口；二、必须在“具有充分监督权力”的“中立观察员”确认已具有“表达民意的自由条件”时，选举才被认为“有效”。他认为，作为朝鲜交战一方的联合国竟是最有“资格”指定这些“中立观察员”的。
    皮杜尔假装不懂为什么人们把美国叫做“帝国主义”，虽然来自大西洋彼岸的干预对今日的法国并不是陌生的事情。皮杜尔还企图不承认亚洲人民争取民族解放的历史潮流，他说，他不认为继续在亚洲实行殖民政策是“过时的”。
    英国外交大臣艾登接着发言。许多天以来，西方报纸都报道美国代表团对英国代表的沉默大为不满。
    十三日艾登的发言一开始就竭力为美国侵略朝鲜的行为辩护。他说美国在朝鲜战争中负担最大，应该向美国“致敬”。他对于中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来在五月三日提出的关于战俘问题的建议特别表示反对。据他说，这个问题在英国政府看来是已经解决了的。他把美国在今年一月强迫扣留二万一千多名朝中被俘人员的行为说成是符合于日内瓦公约和停战协定的。但是有大英联邦的一员——印度参加的中立国遣返委员会在其“最后报告”中指出：美方释放战俘是非法的。而且，艾登还故意不提在朝鲜停战前不久李承晚集团在美国纵容下强迫扣留二万七千多名朝中被俘人员的事情。关于这件事情，英国首相邱吉尔曾在一九五三年六月二十二日在英国下议院宣布：英国政府照会李承晚政府说：“女王政府强烈谴责这种……背叛行为。”而“联合国军”总司令克拉克，在其一九五三年六月二十九日给金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的复信中也曾经允诺：“联合国军正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘”。事实显然不像艾登所说的那样“已经解决”了。
    艾登为英国对亚洲的政策辩护，但亚洲人民对英国的殖民政策，是十分了解的。
    艾登表示，他反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日所提出的建议。他毫无理由地说南日的建议不能导致建立全朝鲜的单一、独立和民主的政府。他承认会议中有很大的意见分歧，但是他又说还有许多共同之点。他说不应当对达成朝鲜问题的解决方法感到失望。
    接着，艾登提出了他认为解决朝鲜问题必须遵循的五项原则，这五项含糊的“原则”是：一、应由选举产生全朝鲜政府；二、选举应真正反映人民的意志，并考虑到南北朝鲜的人口分布情况；三、选举应以成年人的普遍投票和秘密投票为基础，并应尽可能迅速地在真正自由的条件下举行；四、选举应在联合国监督之下进行，参加监督的国家不一定是参加朝鲜战争的国家，可以是经本会议同意的国家；五、任何解决朝鲜问题的计划必须提供外国军队可以撤退的条件。
    艾登主张举行有限制的会议来进行实际的讨论，一俟工作完成即向大会提出报告。
    在艾登发言完毕以后，没有人要求发言。主席宣布下次会议何时举行将另行通知。会议于四时十分休会。
