Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 30th: According to newspaper reports, the Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon, at the Colombo conference that opened on the 28th, discussed the first item on the agenda – the Indochina situation.

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking at the meeting, emphasized the significance of the Indochina issue. Nehru said: "The Geneva Conference is considering this issue, or is about to consider it. If any achievement is gained at the Geneva Conference – for example, a ceasefire – then this would be a great gain in the eyes of the whole world and our respective countries. The tense situation will slowly ease."

    During the discussion on the Indochina issue, the five Prime Ministers of South Asia discussed Nehru's proposal for restoring peace in Indochina. According to reports from various news agencies from Colombo, the participants of the conference agreed on the following two points of this proposal: an immediate cessation of hostilities in Indochina; termination of French sovereignty in Indochina.

    Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo pointed out in his speech that the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be recognized. The conference decided to postpone the adoption of this decision. He emphasized that the fact that the People's Republic of China is excluded from the United Nations is a reason for increasing tensions in Southeast Asia. China has a legitimate right to participate in international organizations.

    The Prime Minister of Pakistan suggested including the Kashmir issue on the conference agenda. Indian Prime Minister Nehru suggested discussing this issue together with the issue of US military "aid" to Pakistan.

    The Madras Sunday Times, in an editorial entitled "Hands Off Asia," commented on the Colombo conference and talked about the US conspiracy to piece together a Southeast Asian military bloc. The paper wrote that India, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Indonesia should firmly oppose the conspiracy to drag this region into future conflicts. The Colombo conference should pass a firm and unanimous resolution on this issue, declaring to the United States: the United States had better get out of Southeast Asia.

    The Bombay "Free Press Journal," in an editorial entitled "Provocation to Asia," criticized the United States' conspiracy to establish a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. The paper emphasized that "this is a provocation to the independence and dignity of Asian countries."

    南亚五国总理会议讨论印度支那局势
   【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社德里三十日讯：据报纸报道，印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、印度尼西亚和锡兰的总理在二十八日开幕的科伦坡会议上，讨论了会议的第一项议程——印度支那局势问题。
    印度总理尼赫鲁在会上发言时着重指出了印度支那问题的意义。尼赫鲁说：“日内瓦会议已在考虑这个问题，或即将考虑这个问题，如果在日内瓦会议上获得任何成就——例如说实行停火，那么在全世界和我们各个国家看来，这是极大的收获。紧张局势将慢慢地缓和下来。”
    南亚五国总理在讨论印度支那问题时，讨论了尼赫鲁提出的关于恢复印度支那和平的建议。据各通讯社自科伦坡报道，会议的参加者都同意这一建议的下面两点：立即停止印度支那的战火；终止法国在印度支那的主权。
    印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在发言中指出，必须承认中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。会议决定延期通过这一决定。他强调指出，中华人民共和国被排挤在联合国以外这件事，是增加东南亚紧张局势的一个原因。中国有参加国际机构的合法权利。
    巴基斯坦总理建议把克什米尔问题列入会议议程。印度总理尼赫鲁建议把这个问题和美国给予巴基斯坦以军事“援助”的问题一起讨论。
    马德拉斯星期日“时代周刊”在题为“不准动亚洲”的社论中评论科伦坡会议，并谈到美国拼凑东南亚军事集团的阴谋。该报写道，印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、锡兰和印度尼西亚应当坚决地反对将这一地区卷入未来的冲突的阴谋。科伦坡会议应当就这一问题通过一项坚决一致的决议，向美国宣布：美国最好是滚出东南亚。
    孟买“自由新闻报”在题为“对亚洲的挑衅”的社论中，斥责美国建立东南亚侵略集团的阴谋。该报着重指出，“这是对亚洲各国的独立和尊严的挑衅。”
