    Our Ge Village Agricultural Production Cooperative Has Expanded and Consolidated
    Zhang Changde, Secretary of the Ge Village Branch of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Ge Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shahe County, Hebei Province
    In the winter of 1952, we began to organize an agricultural production cooperative in our village. At that time, there were only nineteen households in the cooperative, of which eleven were Party members, four were branch committee members, thirteen were propagandists, and one was a militia platoon leader; only two people did not hold any positions. Therefore, the masses called our cooperative a "cadre cooperative" and a "Party member cooperative." In the first few months, everyone was united and worked well; the mutual aid team harvested an average of 183 jin of wheat per mu, while the cooperative harvested 264 jin per mu. Wheat requires relatively little labor, and the problems were relatively simple. After harvesting the wheat and planting cotton and millet, more problems arose when hoeing the seedlings, and the enthusiasm of the members waned. Because we were using the old methods of fixed division and fixed records from the mutual aid team, those who worked more and those who worked less were recorded with the same work points; and when it wasn't too busy, working a day earned that many work points, and when it was extremely busy, working a day still earned that many work points. The more cotton and millet required everyone to work together in intense labor, the less willing everyone was to put in effort. Everyone waited for the gong to sound before going to the field, and waited for everyone to gather before starting work; everyone worked shoulder to shoulder, and no one wanted to work more and suffer a loss. The town had a market every ten days, and whenever there was a market, seven or eight people would ask for leave to go to the market or watch a play. The cooperative's land was overgrown with weeds. Shen Qingde outside the cooperative said, "Whose livestock needs grass to eat? Go to the cooperative's land to cut grass!" At that time, Nie Guangzhong, a backbone member of the cooperative, also said, "Our cooperative is like the sun setting in the west!" Some members were clamoring to split up and work individually. It looked like the cooperative was about to fall apart. At that time, we quickly grasped the ideological rectification within the Party branch; the cooperative also rectified its organization, letting three households leave the cooperative; then we solved some specific problems, changing the fixed division and fixed records to flexible evaluation based on fixed division, and changing the work point recording method to different work points based on the busy and idle seasons and the heaviness of the work. The dangerous situation was reversed. Although it was a year of poor harvest, the cooperative's cotton and millet harvest was still dozens of jin higher per mu than the average of the mutual aid teams and individual farmers. We also grasped the accumulation of fertilizer, applying three carts of manure per mu when planting wheat, and the wheat seedlings grew very well everywhere. When the masses saw the cooperative's wheat seedlings, they became enthusiastic about joining the cooperative again.
    It is true that running a cooperative is difficult. Although I didn't give in to the difficulties and was determined to continue, I just didn't want to expand. Whenever anyone mentioned adding households, I felt a headache. Some people asked to join the cooperative, but I closed the door and refused to admit them. I said: This cooperative of a dozen households is enough trouble for me, if you want to join, form a new cooperative!
    Later, the special district organized cooperative directors from various counties to visit the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, and I went from Shahe County. I thought, I lead this cooperative of a dozen households, and I'm already suffering from eye trouble; Geng Changsuo's cooperative has two or three hundred households, how do they manage? When Geng Changsuo gave his report, I squeezed to the front to listen carefully. He talked about methods such as dividing into teams and groups, contracting work, and assigning production quotas. After listening, my thinking became a little active, thinking: If we expand a little, we might be able to do it. We also visited the tractor station plowing the land for Geng Changsuo's cooperative, and the plowing was really fast and deep. I thought again: If we don't do a good job and don't expand the cooperative, we will never be able to use machines. Later, I made a self-criticism to the masses and made up my mind: Use as much strength as you have!
    When Expanding and Building the Cooperative
    Where you've been beaten, you know where it hurts; where you've stumbled, you know where the pit is. Last year, when we first ran the cooperative, we didn't do a good job in production, and almost caused the cooperative to collapse. This year, we were extra careful. From the time the cooperative was established, we never relaxed production. Last year, the cooperative bought a lot of fertilizer, but although the yield was higher than the mutual aid team, the members' income was not much higher. At the beginning of this year, we paid attention to mobilizing the members to accumulate their own fertilizer. In addition to mobilizing them politically and ideologically, we also stipulated specific methods: members who accumulate a cart (about 1,000 jin) of manure and sell it to the cooperative would be paid 20,000 yuan. On the fourth day of the first lunar month, everyone went to the fields to scrape grass to prepare to accumulate fertilizer. The people scraping grass in the wasteland were like attending a fair. In the past, women were unwilling to walk on the streets with baskets on their backs, fearing that people would laugh at them; after mobilization, many women also carried baskets on their backs and went to the fields to scrape grass. Sending manure, plowing, harrowing, hoeing wheat, and other farm work were not delayed at all during the establishment of the cooperative.
    We know that we cannot just look at the masses' temporary enthusiasm. What is the masses' thinking really like? When we decided to expand and build the cooperative, we used the Party and Youth League organizations to get a sense of the situation.
    At that time, out of the 238 households in the village, about 60 or 70 households were the most active. Most of these people were Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists. They had a preliminary understanding of the fact that the socialist road is good, the capitalist road is not good, what a socialist system looks like, and what a semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative looks like. These dozens of households were the first to sign up to join the cooperative. More than 100 households were relatively active and progressive masses in the village, who knew that the countryside must take the socialist road, but didn't understand how the socialist system and agricultural production cooperatives work, and had many doubts; they wanted to join the cooperative, but were afraid of suffering losses. There were also more than 40 households who were relatively backward in their thinking; at that time, they were unwilling to join the cooperative no matter what we said.
    After the branch understood the thinking of the masses, it held several general meetings and small group discussions after preparation. One general meeting talked about what a socialist society looks like, and I also reported on the situation I saw when I visited the Geng Changsuo cooperative. One general meeting mainly introduced the draft of the new cooperative charter revised based on the experience and lessons of the old cooperative last year, explaining the methods of joining the cooperative with land, livestock, and farm tools, the methods of calculating labor, the methods of contracting work and assigning production quotas, and the cooperative's financial system; and also reviewed the shortcomings of the old cooperative, and compared and explained the benefits of the new cooperative charter. After some backward people's thinking was cleared up, they became activists, automatically spreading propaganda everywhere and mobilizing others to join the cooperative. The branch collected the problems reflected in the discussion meetings and studied them again, and then held another general meeting. At this general meeting, twelve typical figures selected from among those who had cleared their minds and resolutely joined the cooperative spoke, including old men, women, and former individual farmers who talked about the difficulties of working alone, and old cooperative members who talked about the comparison between their lives after joining the cooperative and before joining the cooperative. These typical speeches really solved problems and touched the hearts of many people. At this general meeting, those who had signed up in the past also signed up again, stating that those who were not willing could withdraw their names. When people signed up at the general meeting, it was like fighting, with layers inside and outside, vying to have their names written down. A total of 204 households signed up. After the meeting, they were divided into small groups for discussion, and another 20 households signed up in the small group meetings, for a total of 224 households. At this time, the cooperative construction committee reviewed the applicants household by household. During the review, an atmosphere was created in which those who were screened out seemed to have become bad people, which made some people who were not originally willing afraid to say they were not willing. Some people said this: "Everyone else has joined the cooperative, can we be 'foreigners'?" Some of these people joined the cooperative for fear of "being isolated," not because they were truly willing. In order to ensure that those who joined the cooperative were truly willing, we came up with another way to change the atmosphere, explaining to everyone more clearly that joining the cooperative must be truly voluntary. After the review, the final 208 households that remained were those with relatively stable thinking.
    An important reason why our cooperative is so large and has not had any major problems so far is that we did this relatively detailed ideological education work when expanding and building the cooperative, laying a good foundation ideologically. The work of evaluating land yields, evaluating livestock and farm tool prices, etc., was also done relatively carefully and reasonably.
      When Organizing Labor
    After the large cooperative was officially established, the first thing we grasped was team formation. If the teams are not formed well in such a large cooperative, nothing can be done. The teams were formed based on the number of households, the amount of labor, and the distance of residence, based on the old cooperative and the original mutual aid teams. During the team formation, the ideological problems of the members were exposed again. The old cooperative had more backbone members and more experience in running the cooperative, and the old cooperative members knew each other's temperaments and were unwilling to separate. However, other teams had fewer backbone members and needed to be transferred out. Later, it was made clear that it was in everyone's interest to lead each team in the cooperative well, and finally four households were transferred out. This team, based on the old cooperative, was formed into the eighth team; the members of the seventh team, which lived near the eighth team, felt that their team's leadership was weak and had not run a cooperative before, "and didn't know if he could lead well," so they all wanted to jump to the eighth team. After much persuasion and adding a deputy captain to the seventh team, the problem was solved.
    After the teams were formed, we began to divide the cultivation areas for each team. The cultivation areas were divided according to the amount of labor in each team, matching the land suitable for growing various crops, and according to the quality, distance, and distribution of wells. After the land was divided, livestock and farm tools were allocated according to the labor and land of each team. With every step, the members always showed their thoughts of only caring about themselves and departmentalism. After the land was divided, the third team quarreled the most fiercely. They complained that the land they were allocated was poor, saying that this piece was near the road, that piece had thatch, and that piece had graves, "replace any piece that has no problems"; they quarreled as soon as they went to the field to work, and couldn't work well. In fact, it is difficult for the land allocated to each team to be exactly the same, and it can only be roughly balanced by labor. Even if the land of that team is poorer, the output is also set lower, and the team does not suffer. After explaining this principle clearly, they had no objections. Going to each team, no team said their livestock was good, and they all said that the livestock in their team was too poor, and always felt that the livestock in other teams was stronger than their own. Generally speaking, there were not many strong livestock in the cooperative, and it was not enough. However, there were still some strong livestock; if everyone said the livestock was not strong, where did the original strong livestock go? In reality, everyone had departmentalism, only looking at their own team, not looking at the whole cooperative. After educating the members to see the situation of the whole cooperative clearly, explaining that the livestock was not enough as a whole, and that some would be added soon and distributed to each team, and that there would be another thorough adjustment in the future, everyone's opinions were relatively less. Later, everyone was busy with cotton planting, putting their minds on production, and stopped clamoring about the livestock problem.
      When Setting Production Plans
    After spending half a month to form the production teams well and allocate land, farm tools, and livestock, we grasped another important thing in production, which was to set production plans.
    We first made a draft of the production plan and sent it to the district office. Later, the district distributed the production plan figures based on the national plan and the plans sent by various villages. The main cadres of our cooperative first discussed the spirit of the national plan, unified their thinking, and recognized the significance of appropriately expanding the planting area of cotton and oil crops in our region, and also recognized that we should not relax grain production. At the same time, we also made specific discussions according to the land conditions of our cooperative. As a result of the discussion, everyone believed that the yield of peanuts planted on our land was not high, and we wanted to reduce some peanuts and plant more cotton. We told the district about this opinion, and the district agreed.
    After the cooperative's plan was roughly determined, it was sent to each team for discussion. Some members still had ideological problems with expanding the cotton area according to the national plan. I led everyone to recall the past, and those who planted crops according to the state's call in our area have never suffered losses, and have always benefited. In 1947, the people's government called for planting indigo, and all the families who responded to the call benefited greatly. In 1948, the year was not good, and the autumn crops failed, and the people's government called for planting buckwheat, and all those who responded to the call smoothly overcame the difficulties, and the buckwheat harvest was very good, and everyone said it was "passed the second May" (like harvesting a second crop of wheat). One year, the people's government called for expanding wheat fields, and those who planted wheat the following year also had a good time. Furthermore, the state is now calling for planting more cotton precisely because industry needs it; we say we love socialism, but we cannot just shout slogans. The state guarantees that those who plant cotton have grain to eat; this year's guarantee of supply, does that mean there will be no supply next year? We also mobilized propagandists to publicize the reason for planting more cotton, and everyone's thinking was quickly cleared up. Everyone remembered that last year the agricultural production cooperative was closely linked with the supply and marketing cooperative, and it was also more convenient to sell cotton, so they knew even more the benefits of the cooperative producing according to the national plan.
      When Contracting Work and Assigning Production Quotas
    After the planting plan was drawn up, we also set out a plan for the number of labor work points required for various crops based on the requirements of increasing production and achieving high yields, and plans for using fertilizer, adding waterwheels, etc. Then, we mobilized each team to contract work and assign production quotas. According to the land of each team, what crops to plant, how much yield to achieve, how much labor and fertilizer to use, were all set and contracted to each team. The yield exceeding the contracted output belongs entirely to the labor force of each team (20% of which will be extracted to reward some of the best workers in the team). Because we have a lot of irrigated land here, and it is not subject to flooding, the yield is relatively stable, and the implementation of contracting production quotas is a more favorable condition. It is also difficult to run such a large cooperative well without implementing the method of contracting work and assigning production quotas, and everyone agreed to this method. Some people said: "If this method had been used in last year's cooperative, I guarantee there wouldn't be so much grass growing in the fields." However, there were still many difficulties in the initial implementation. When dividing the land, everyone wanted good land; when assigning production quotas, everyone complained that the output quotas set for their land were too high. There were also people who said: "Anyway, it's just these people, just muddle along, why bother contracting work and assigning production quotas?" In reality, he wanted to do less work and fool around inside. At this time, we sent out propaganda forces again to do a good job in ideological education, so that everyone recognized the necessity and benefits of contracting work and assigning production quotas, strengthened the education of cherishing the interests of the entire cooperative, and at the same time adjusted the planned output that was indeed unreasonably set. Everyone accepted the requirements of contracting work and assigning production quotas, and guaranteed that the contracts were fair.
    It is not enough to contract from the cooperative to the teams alone. The teams also need to contract the work suitable for a small group of people or one person to a group or individual according to the method of setting time, setting quality, and setting quantity. At first, each team did not implement this method of small contracting, and there was a situation of wasted labor. Every night, evaluating work and recording points took a long time. We proposed the implementation of the small contracting method, but at that time, each team was unwilling to accept it, and only the eighth team agreed to try it. We helped the eighth team divide into three groups, allocating livestock with different speeds and land with different qualities. Then, the team contracted the farm work to the groups. The work suitable for everyone in the group was done by everyone, and the work points were recorded using the method of flexible evaluation based on fixed division; the work suitable for individuals was contracted to individuals on a piecework basis. For hoeing wheat, hoeing 2.3 mu of small ridge land counts as one labor day, 2.6 mu of large ridge land, and 3 mu of sandy land. Whoever hoes more and meets the quality standards can earn more points. In this way, a lot of time for evaluating points and assigning work is saved, and everyone's enthusiasm for production can be encouraged. Other teams saw that this method was really good and automatically followed suit. Only the fourth team has not yet implemented it, and we are helping them solve this problem. After the implementation of small contracting, another problem occurred: everyone competed to do contracted work, because more work earned more points; no one wanted to do work that was calculated by the day. This problem also needs to be solved quickly.
    After the implementation of the contracting method, special attention should also be paid to checking the quality and time of the work. I went to the field to check the wheat hoeing situation and found that some of the land was hoed well at the beginning, but it was terrible inside. When planting cotton, we checked and found that the sixth team did not implement warm soup soaking and seed dressing with medicine, and planted seven mu with dry seeds; the pits were not dug correctly either. After educating them, they soaked the seeds and changed the pit diggers, and the planting density was also more appropriate. The second team delayed planting cotton more than other teams on the pretext of wind, and did not proceed according to the plan; after inspection and supervision, they began to plant.
      Ideological Education Cannot Be Interrupted For A Single Day
    There was a livestock feeder in the third team named Shen Jinghe. In the first few days when the livestock were first fed together, he only mixed more feed for the cow that originally belonged to him, and also tied the cow's reins particularly long so that it could eat more grass. The captain, Shen Lianzhen, was also only thinking about the livestock that originally belonged to her in the first few days, and brought the water used for washing pots at home to the livestock shed, only for her livestock to drink.
    The original livestock feeder in the first team was very careless, sometimes only cared about sleeping at night and forgot to feed. As a result, a horse was fed badly; it couldn't pull the waterwheel and stood still. The livestock feeder didn't say he was wrong, but only complained that the cooperative gave too little feed. The livestock in the tenth team was not fed well either.
    Problems like this cannot be solved by just the director and captain checking; ideological education is essential at all times.
    To strengthen ideological education, we must start with the branch. We originally held branch meetings twice a month according to regulations, one for learning and one for criticism and self-criticism, and these meetings must be enriched in the future. Recently, the branch is preparing to give Party members political lessons more systematically. Party members are generally very willing to learn regularly in this way, and their mood is very good. We have already divided the Party and Youth League groups according to the production teams, changing the past method of dividing groups by street and area. In this way, the branch can strengthen leadership over each production team.
    We have used some of the following methods to conduct ideological education for the members:
    One method is to hold general meetings of members to summarize the achievements of each stage of farm work, commend the members who are active in labor, and discuss the advantages of the cooperative that have already been manifested in production. Like harrowing, hoeing, and preserving moisture, it was completed in three days after the cooperative was formed; it would not have been possible if it hadn't become a large cooperative. There is more fertilizer, farm work is done early, what the land is suitable for planting is planted, the plots are larger and labor is saved, women, semi-laborers, and the elderly also have work to do, and people can be drawn out to do the side business of weaving mats, which was not possible when the cooperative was not formed. Studying the cooperative charter and mobilizing everyone to produce according to the national plan also held general meetings of members, which played a role in ideological education.
    Another method is to hold a review meeting in the team when something goes wrong in that team. There was a Zhang Bingwu in the sixth team, and the captain asked him to plow the land, but he insisted on sending manure, which made it impossible for the captain to arrange work. The team held a review meeting, and several people spoke, all saying: If everyone wants to do whatever they want, the team's affairs cannot be handled. Zhang Bingwu recognized his mistake, and the other members of the team were also educated about labor discipline. The tenth team also had a problem: the captain accidentally made an unfair work assignment once, and the easy-to-hoe and difficult-to-hoe land were calculated as hoeing three mu as one labor day, and someone raised an objection, and a quarrel broke out over this matter. Later, a review meeting was held, and the captain and the members of the team reviewed their mistakes; I participated in that meeting, and also reviewed to everyone that I did not take good care of this team, and asked everyone to give me their opinions. Everyone criticized me for spending too little time in this team. This opinion is correct, and I accepted it. I introduced to them the experience of small contracting in other teams, and after discussion, they stipulated the methods for improvement in the future, and everyone's emotions improved. In this way, the work was improved, the problems were solved, and everyone was educated, and we cadres were educated.
    Still another method is to give everyone a trial calculation of income. Most members couldn't calculate this account in the first place, couldn't figure out the bottom line, were worried and afraid, and didn't know how much income they could get after working for a year. Recently, we have calculated the minimum income that each labor day and each stone of output can be distributed this year, and we have also tried to calculate for several typical households, households with more land and households with more labor. The results of the trial calculation proved that the income of a household with the most land and the least labor can also increase by 13.7% compared to the income of the past normal years; the income of a household with more income this year can increase by 68.7% compared to the income of the past normal years. If the output exceeds the plan and the contracted output, everyone's income will be even higher. The more labor days someone does, the more income they will get. Some members were very excited when they heard the results of this trial calculation. We are planning to use propagandists to publicize the results of the trial calculation and the method of calculating this account to each household in detail, so that everyone can understand the bottom line and encourage them to produce more actively. And explain that the biggest income in the cooperative is cotton, and the total value of autumn crop income is more than 880 million yuan, of which cotton accounts for more than 540 million yuan, encouraging everyone to increase cotton production well.
    How To Shoulder Such A Heavy Burden
    Last year, when leading a small cooperative of a dozen households, we still felt that the burden was too heavy. This year, when leading this large cooperative, it feels easier to handle than last year. This is not because the large cooperative is easier to handle than the small cooperative. The main reason why the cooperative was not run well last year was that we did not mobilize everyone's strength. At that time, everyone didn't go to the field until the sun was high, and I had to go door to door to call them. This year, we learned from last year's lessons, learned from the experience of the Geng Changsuo cooperative, improved the production teams, mobilized the grassroots forces, and relied on the members to run the cooperative, and things became easier to handle. When we were about to become a large cooperative, I was a little timid, just because I didn't understand this principle and didn't trust the masses. In the past few months, I have gradually learned to rely on everyone to run the cooperative. The important affairs of the cooperative are all handled by the backbone members of the cooperative together.
    To rely on everyone to run the cooperative, one important thing must be done well, which is to pay attention to continuously cultivating backbone members and improving everyone's ability to run the cooperative. I have learned that the most important thing for a cooperative to be run well or not is the captain. One household in the ninth team left the cooperative because they didn't like the captain and didn't get along with the captain. In production, if the captain plans a little short, there will be wasted labor. Some teams divided many people to a piece of land to plant cotton, and it was finished in half a day, and they had to be temporarily arranged again and moved to another place, see how much work this can delay! I often go to each team to help the captain solve specific problems, conduct ideological education, and improve the captain's ability; but I haven't done enough in the past, and I will strengthen it in the future. Some captains' democratic style is still very poor, and there are few methods. My culture is very low, and my ability is not very strong, and I have to study hard myself. We are preparing to ask the comrades of the resident work team to systematically explain the policies and methods of running the cooperative to the backbone members of our entire cooperative. When the cooperative is large and there are many households, a small thing will involve many people and become a big thing. Society is developing very quickly, and if you don't improve yourself, you will not be able to keep up. In the future, our cooperative will inevitably improve step by step, and we will also strive to use tractors as soon as possible, and the burden will become heavier and heavier. It won't work if you don't study hard.
    In order to run the cooperative well, we must also study the good experiences of the cooperatives outside. The cooperatives in several villages near us have formed a cooperative network, and meet on the first, eleventh, and twenty-first days of the lunar month to exchange experiences. We learned the experience of the Xicui Cooperative in feeding livestock, and the members all feel that it is better than the previous method. We also introduced our specific methods of contracting work and assigning production quotas and contracting fertilizer to other cooperatives, and other cooperatives also said it was very good.

    我们葛村农业生产合作社扩大和巩固了
    中共河北省沙河县葛村支部书记葛村农业生产合作社社长  张常的
    一九五二年冬天，我们村里开始组织农业生产合作社。那时候，社里总共十九户，里边就有十一个人是党员，有四个人还是支部委员，有十三个人是宣传员，有一个人是民兵分队长；没有担任什么职务的群众只有两个人。因此，群众把我们这个社叫做“干部社”“党员社”。头几个月，大家齐心，干得还好；互助组的麦子平均每亩收了一百八十三斤，社里每亩收了二百六十四斤。麦子费工比较少，问题比较简单。收了麦子，种上棉花、谷子，锄小苗的时候，问题就多了，社员们的那股劲头也消了。因为用的是过去互助组里的死分死记的办法，干多干少一个样记工；并且不太忙的时候做一天记那么多工，顶忙的时候做一天也还是记那么多工；越是棉花谷子需要大家一齐动手紧张劳动的时候，大家越是不肯拿出力气来。大家都等打锣了才上地，在地头上等齐了才干活；大家都不前不后，并着肩膀干，谁也恐怕多干了活吃亏。镇上十天三集，遇集总有七八个人告假去赶集或是看戏。社里的地，长满了草。社外的申庆德说：“谁家牲口缺草吃，到社的地里去割草吧！”社里的骨干聂光中那时候也说：“咱们的社像日头已经到天西边了！”有些社员吵着要分开干。眼看这个社是要散伙了。那时候，我们赶快抓紧先在党支部里整顿了思想；社里也整顿了组织，让三户出社了；接着又解决了一些具体问题，把死分死记改成了死分活评，把记分的办法改成按季节忙闲和活的轻重记不同的工分。危险的局面是扭过来了。虽然是个歉收年成，社里的棉花、谷子的收成到底还是比互助组和单干户平均每亩都高几十斤。又抓紧了积肥，种麦时候每亩地上了三车土粪，麦苗无论哪一块长得都很好。群众看见社里的麦苗，对入社又热中了。
    说办社困难，可也真是。我虽说没有向困难低头，坚决要干下去；可是，就是不愿意扩大。一提添户，我就觉得头痛。有些人要求入社，我是闭门不纳。我说：这十几户的社就够我作难的了，你们要入社就另外成立新社吧！
    后来，专区组织各县的社长去饶阳县耿长锁农业生产合作社参观，沙河县是我去了。我想，我领导这个十几户的社，还熬得害眼；耿长锁社二三百户，可咋办？耿长锁报告的时候，我就挤到前边去仔细听。他谈了分队分组、包工包产等等办法，我听了，思想有些活动了，想着：扩大一些，许能干。我们又参观了拖拉机站给耿长锁社耕地，犁得真是又快又深。我又想：不好好搞，不扩大社，就永远也使不上机器。后来，我向群众作了检讨，下定决心：有多大劲，使多大劲！
    在扩大建社的时候
    哪里挨过打，知道哪里痛；在哪儿跌过交，知道哪儿是个坑。去年初次办社，在生产上没有干好，把社弄得几乎垮了。今年，我们就格外加了小心。从成立社的时候起，就没有放松过生产。去年社里买肥料不少，虽说产量比互助组高，社员们的收入并不多。今年一开头就注意发动社员自己积肥。除了从政治思想上动员以外，还规定了具体的办法：社员们积一车（大约一千斤）土粪，卖给社里，给两万元的代价。旧历正月初四，大家就都下地刮草准备积肥了。在荒地里刮草的人，像赶会的一样。过去，妇女们不愿背着篓子在街上走，怕人笑话自己；经过发动，许多妇女们也背起篓下地刮草了。送粪、犁地、耙地、锄麦等等农活，在成社当中却
  一点也没耽搁。
    我们知道，不能光看群众一时的一股子热劲。群众的思想到底怎么样呢？决定扩大建社的时候，我们就通过党和团的组织，摸了一下底。
    那时候，在全村二百三十八户里边，大约有六七十户是最积极的。这些人大部分是党员、团员、宣传员，他们对于社会主义道路好、资本主义道路不好、社会主义制度是个什么样子，半社会主义的农业生产合作社是个什么样子，有了初步的认识。这几十户最先报名入社。有一百多户，是村里比较积极的进步群众，知道农村一定要走社会主义道路，可是对于社会主义制度和农业生产合作社是怎么办法都还弄不清楚，有很多怀疑；又想入社，又怕吃亏。另外还有四十多户人家，比较起来思想是更落后的；那时候，说啥也不愿意入社。
    支部了解了群众的思想情况以后，经过准备，召开了几次大会和小组讨论会。一次大会讲社会主义社会是什么样子，我还报告了在耿长锁社参观的情形。一次大会主要是介绍根据去年老社的经验教训修订的新社章草案，把土地、牲口、农具入社的办法，计算劳动的办法，包工包产的办法，社里的财务制度都向大家讲了个明白；还检讨了老社的缺点，对比着说明了新社章的好处。有些落后的人思想通了以后，就变成了积极分子，自动地到处宣传，动员别人入社。支部把讨论会上反映出来的问题又集中起来做了研究，又召开了一次大会。这次大会上，有从已经打通思想坚决入社的人中间挑选出的十二个典型人物发了言，有老头，有妇女，有原来的单干户谈单干的困难，有老社社员谈入社以后的生活和入社以前的对比。这些典型发言真解决问题，把很多人的心都打动了。在这次大会上，要过去报了名的也都重新报名，说明不自愿的可以不再报。大会上报名的时候，人们跟打架的一样，里一层外一层，争着要求把自己的名字写上。总共报了二百零四户。会后再分开小组讨论，在小组会上又有二十户报了名，总共是二百二十四户。这时候，建社委员会对报名的人又挨户进行了审查。审查的时候，无形中造成了一种空气，就好像被审查出去的都成了坏人，这就会使有些本来不自愿的人也不敢说不自愿了。有人就这样说：“别人都入社了，咱能当个‘外国人’？”这样一些人是怕“受孤立”才入社的，并不是真正自愿。为了保证入社的人都是自愿的，我们就又想办法换了一换空气，向大家更清楚地说明了入社一定要真正自愿。经过审查，最后剩下来的二百零八户都是思想比较稳定的。
    我们这么大一个社，到现在还没有出什么大问题，一个重要原因就是在扩大建社的时候做了这些比较细致的思想教育工作，在思想上打好了底子。评土地产量、评牲口农具价格等等工作，做得也比较细致合理。
      在组织劳动力的时候
    大社正式成立起来以后，我们抓紧的头一件事就是编队。这么大个社，不把队编好，就啥也没法干。编队是按户数、劳动力的多少和住的远近，按老社和原来的互助组做底子编的。在编队中间，社员们的思想问题就又暴露出来了。老社里的骨干多，也有办社经验，老社社员们在一块谁也摸熟谁的脾气了，都不愿意分开。可是，别的队骨干少，需要调动出去一些。后来讲清楚了把全社每个队都领导好才合乎大家的利益，最后调动出来四户。以老社做底子的这个队，编成了第八队；和第八队住的地方邻近的第七队的社员们，觉得自己队的领导弱，过去没办过社，“还不知道他能领导好不能哩！”就都想往第八队跳。也是经过多次说服，给第七队又添了个副队长，才算把问题解决了。
    把队编好了，就开始给各队划分耕作区。耕作区是按各队劳力多少，把适合种各种庄稼的地搭配开，按土地好坏远近和水井的分布情形划分的。分了地以后，又按各队劳力、土地的多少配备了牲口、农具。每走一步路，社员们总要表现出来只顾自己和本位主义的思想。分地以后，第三队吵得顶厉害。他们嫌分的地赖，说这块临路，那块有茅草，那块有坟，“那一块没毛病管换”；一到地里做活就吵吵，不能好好干活。其实，各队分的地，很难一模一样，只能按劳动来说大体上取平。就是那个队地赖一些，产量定得也低，队里并不吃亏。把这道理讲清，他们也就没意见了。走到各队去，没有一个队说自己的牲口好，都说自己队里的牲口太赖，总觉着别的队的牲口比自己队里的强。整个说来，社里的牲口确实很强的不多，不大够用。可是，强牲口还是有一些的；大家都说牲口不强，原来的强牲口到哪里去了？实际上是大家都有本位主义思想，只看本队，不看全社。教育社员们看清楚全社的情况，说明牲口整个说来都不够用，最近就要添买一些分给各队，将来要再彻底调整一次，大家的意见才比较少了。后来大家都忙着棉花播种，心思用到生产上去，也就不听嚷嚷牲口问题了。
      在订生产计划的时候
    费了半个多月时间，把生产队编好、土地农具牲口分配好以后，我们就抓紧了生产上的又一件要紧事，就是定生产计划。
    我们先作了一个生产计划草案，送到区公所了。后来区里根据国家计划和各村送去的计划，把生产计划数字分配下来了。我们社里的主要干部先讨论了国家计划的精神，统一了思想，认识了在我们这个地区适当扩大棉花油料作物种植面积的意义，也认识了不应该放松粮食生产。同时，也按照我们社里的土地的情况作了具体的讨论。讨论的结果，大家认为我们的地种花生产量不高，想减少一部分花生，多种一些棉花。我们把这个意见告诉区里，区里也同意了。
    社里的计划大体上确定以后，就发到各个队去讨论。对于按国家计划扩大棉花面积，有些社员思想还是不通。我就引大家回想过去，我们这个地方过去每次按国家的号召种庄稼的人，总没吃过亏，总是得了好处。一九四七年人民政府号召种蓝靛，凡是响应号召的人家都得了很大利益。一九四八年年景不好，秋庄稼瞎了，人民政府号召种荞麦，凡是响应号召的都顺利地度过了困难，荞麦收成很好，大家都说是“过了第二个五月”（好比收了第二次麦子）。有一年人民政府号召扩大麦田，第二年种麦的人也都好过了。再说，现在国家号召多种一些棉花，正是因为工业需要；我们说爱社会主义，不能空喊。国家保证种棉花的人有粮食吃；今年保证供应，明年难道就不供应了吗？我们又发动宣传员宣传了多种棉花的道理，大家的思想很快就弄通了。大家又想起去年农业生产合作社因为和供销合作社联系得紧，卖棉花也比较方便，就更知道社里按国家计划生产的好处了。
      在包工包产的时候
    种植计划订出来以后，我们又根据增产丰产的要求定出了各种庄稼需要用劳动工分数的计划，和使用肥料、增添水车等等计划。然后，就发动各队包工包产。按各队的土地，要种些什么庄稼，产量要达到多少，用多少工、多少肥料，都定出数目来，包给各队。超过了包产的产量，完全归各队的劳动力（要从里边抽出百分之二十奖给队里劳动最好的一些人）。因为我们这里水浇地多，又不会遭水淹，产量比较稳定，实行包产的办法是有比较有利的条件的。成立了这么大一个社，不实行包工包产的办法，也很难办好，社员们大家也都赞成这个办法。有人说：“要是去年的社用了这办法，保险地里不会长那么多草。”可是，初次实行，困难还是很多的。在分地的时候，大家都想要好地；到包产的时候，大家又都嫌分给自己的地的产量定得高。还有的人说：“反正就是这些人，糊里糊涂作吧，何必包工包产？”实际上是他想少做活，在里边鬼混。这时候，我们又出动宣传力量，把思想教育工作做好，使大家都认识到包工包产的必要和好处，加强爱护全社利益的教育，同时又把计划产量定得确实不合理的调整了一下。大家都接受了包工包产的要求，而且保证了包得公平。
    光是由社里包给队里，还是不行。队里还需要把适合一小伙人或者一个人做的活，按定时定质定量的办法包给小组或个人。头上来，各队没有实行这种小包工的办法，就有了窝工的情形。每天晚上评工记分派活要占很长时间。我们提出实行小包工的办法，各个队那时候都不肯接受，只有第八队同意了试着做。我们帮助第八队划分了三个小组，把牲口快慢土地好坏调配开。然后，队里把农活包给小组。适合小组大伙干的活，就大伙干，仍用死分活评的办法记工；适合个人干的活就实行个人按件包工的办法。锄麦子，小垄地锄二亩三算一个劳动日，大垄地锄二亩六，沙地锄三亩。谁锄得多，又合质量标准，就能多挣分。这样一来，就节省了不少评分派活的时间，还能鼓励大家的生产积极性。别的队看到这办法确实好，就自动地跟着学起来了。只有第四队还没有实行，我们正在帮助他们解决这个问题。实行小包工以后，还发生了一个问题：大家都争着要做包工活，因为多干就能多挣分；按天计工的活，谁也不愿干了。这个问题也得赶快解决。
    实行了包工的办法以后，还要特别注意检查做活的质量和时间。我下地检查锄麦子的情形，发现有的地地头上锄得不赖，往里就糟糕了。在点种棉花的时候，我们检查出来第六队没有实行温汤浸种、药剂拌种，用干籽种了七亩；刨坑的刨得也不对头。向他们进行了教育以后，他们就浸了种，也换了刨坑的人，播种的密度也比较合适了。第二队借口有风，点种棉花比别的队迟了，没按计划进行；经过检查督促，他们才开始种了。
      思想教育一天也不能断
    第三队有一个喂牲口的，叫申景和。在牲口刚伙到一块喂的时候，头几天，他光给原来他自己的那个牛多拌料，还把这个牛的缰绳拴得特别长一些，叫它能多吃些草。队长申连珍，头几天也是光想着原来自己的那个牲口，把家里的刷锅水端到牲口棚里，光给他的牲口喝。
    第一队原先喂牲口的人很不操心，有时候黑夜只顾睡觉，忘了喂。这样，就把一匹马喂坏了；套上水车拉不动，站着不走。喂牲口的人不说自己不对，光是埋怨社里给料太少。第十队的牲口，喂得也不好。
    像这样的问题，光是社长队长检查也不行；思想教育什么时候也不可少。
    加强思想教育工作，要先从支部作起。我们原来按规定每月开两次支部大会，一次进行学习，一次进行批评和自我批评，这样的会以后要充实起来。最近支部又准备比较系统地给党员上政治课。党员们一般都很愿意这样经常地学习，情绪很好。我们已经按生产队划分了党和团的小组，改变了过去按街按片分小组的办法。这样支部就可以对各个生产队加强领导了。
    我们用过这样一些办法对社员进行思想教育：
    一个办法是开社员大会，总结每一段农活的成绩，表扬劳动积极的社员，并且讨论社在生产中已经表现出来的优越性。像耙地锄地保墒，成了社以后，三天就完成了；要不是成了大社，就办不到。肥料多，农活做得早，地适合种啥就种啥，地块大了省工，妇女、半劳力、老年人也都有活干，能抽出人出去做编席的副业，都是没成社的时候办不到的。学习社章，动员大家按国家计划生产，也各开了一次社员大会，起了思想教育的作用。
      一个办法是在那个队发生了什么问题的时候，在队里开检讨会。第六队有个张丙午，队长叫他犁地他偏要去送粪，弄得队长没法安排活。队里就开了个检讨会，几个人发言，都说：要是谁想干啥就干啥，队里的事就没法办了。张丙午认识了自己的错误，队里别的社员们也都受到了一次关于劳动纪律的教育。第十队也发生了一个问题：队长偶然有一次分派工作不公平，好锄和难锄的地都按锄三亩算一个劳动日，有人提出了意见，为这事吵起架来。后来开了一个检讨会，队长、队里的社员都检讨了自己的不对；我参加了那次会，也向大家检讨了我对这个队照顾得不到，并且要大家对我提意见。大家批评我到这个队的时间太少。这意见是对的，我接受了。我向他们介绍了别的队小包工的经验，他们讨论以后规定了以后改进的办法，大家的情绪都好转了。这样，改进了工作，解决了问题，也教育了大家，教育了我们干部。
    再一个办法是给大家试算收入。大部分社员原先都算不来这个账，摸不清底，担心害怕，不知道劳动一年，到头能得到多大收入。最近，我们已经把每个劳动日和每一石产量的土地今年最低限度可以分得的收入计算出来了，还试算了几个典型户，有土地较多的户，有劳力较多的户。试算的结果证明，土地最多劳力较少的一户，收入也可以比过去平常年景的收入增加百分之十三点七；今年收入较多的一户，可以比过去平常年景的收入增加百分之六十八点七。如果超过计划和包产产量，大家的收入还会更多。谁做的劳动日越多，收入也会越多。有些社员听到了这个试算结果，都很兴奋。我们正打算通过宣传员把试算结果和算这个账的方法向各户详详细细地宣传，使每个人都摸底，鼓励他们更积极地生产。并且说明社里最大的收入是棉花，总共秋季作物收入值八亿八千多万元，棉花就占五亿四千多万元，鼓励大家好好增产棉花。
    这么沉的担子怎么担起来
    去年领导一个十几户的小社，我们还觉得沉的吃不住劲。今年领导这个大社，倒觉得比去年还好办一些。这并不是因为大社比小社好办。去年社没办好，主要原因是我们没有发动大家的力量。那时候，日头上来多高大家还不下地，还得我挨门去喊。今年接受了去年的教训，学习了耿长锁社的经验，把生产队弄好，把底层力量发动起来了，依靠社员大家办社，事情就好办了。在要成大社的时候，我有些胆怯，就因为不懂得这个道理，不相信群众。这几个月，我渐渐地学会了依靠大家办社。社里的重要事情，都是社里的骨干在一起商量着办的。
    要依靠大家办社，有一件重要事情得做好，就是注意不断地培养骨干，提高大家办社的能力。我体会到，一个社办好办不好，队长最关紧要。第九队有一户出了社，就因为嫌队长不好，和队长不对劲。在生产里边，队长稍一计划不到，就要窝工。有的队分了许多人到一块地去点种棉花，做了半晌就做完了，还得临时再安排，再挪地方，看这能误多少工！我常到各队去，帮助队长解决具体问题，进行思想教育，提高队长的能力；可是过去做得还不够，以后还要加强。有的队长的民主作风还很差，办法也少。我文化很低，能力也不很强，自己也要好好学习。我们准备请驻地工作组的同志们给我们全社的骨干系统地讲解办社的政策和办法。社大了，户多了，出一个小事牵连的人就会很多，就会变成大事。社会向前发展得很快，不提高自己，也会赶不上。将来我们的社必然要一步步提高，还要争取早使拖拉机，担子就越来越重了。不好好学习，可不行。
    为了把社办好，我们还要好好学习外边的社的好经验。我们近处几个村的社成立了一个合作网，逢阴历初一、十一、二十一开会，交流经验。我们学了西崔社喂牲口的经验，社员们都觉得比早先的办法好。我们也向别的社介绍了我们的包工包产和肥料包干的具体办法，别的社也说很好。            （燕凌代笔）（附图片）
