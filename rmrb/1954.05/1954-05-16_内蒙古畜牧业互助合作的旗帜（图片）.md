The banner of mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region—the Huheletai Animal Husbandry Production Mutual Aid Group in Hatanhushuo Baga (Village), Chen Barag Banner, Hulunbuir League, has developed its production due to its organization. With the help of government loans of livestock, the mutual aid group established a settlement, implemented settled nomadism, carried out planned division of labor, and designated special personnel for grazing and herding. They have also carried out many reforms in production, such as using new production tools like horse-drawn mowing machines and raking machines, improving livestock breeds, improving livestock feeding management, and grazing cattle and sheep in separate groups. In the past three years, the mutual aid group's livestock has increased seventeen times, and the whole group now has more than 2,100 livestock, with an annual income of more than 100 million yuan from sideline production. With the development of production, the material and cultural life of the group members has also been continuously improved, fully demonstrating the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry. After studying the country's general task during the transition period, the group members have further raised their political awareness and are now actively striving to transform into an animal husbandry production cooperative.

    All members of the group are assigned tasks according to their respective strengths. This is a member responsible for herding horses, lassoing a horse on the pasture. This is the mutual aid group's new horse-drawn mowing machine and raking machine.

    With the development of production, the material and cultural life of the group members has also improved. This is a picture of group members playing a gramophone and enjoying music during their evening rest time.

    The Huheletai Animal Husbandry Production Mutual Aid Group had only 32 livestock when it was first established, but now it has more than 1,300 sheep.

    内蒙古畜牧业互助合作的旗帜
    内蒙古自治区畜牧业生产互助合作的旗帜——呼伦贝尔盟陈巴尔虎旗哈坦胡硕巴嘎（村）的胡和勒泰畜牧生产互助组，由于组织起来，生产得到了发展。在政府贷给牲畜的帮助下，互助组建立了定居地，实行定居游牧，进行有计划的分工，指定专人放收；在生产方面也进行了许多改革；如使用马拉打草机、搂草机等新式生产工具，改良畜种，改善牲畜的饲养管理，牛羊分群放牧等。三年多来，互助组牲畜增殖了十七倍，现全组有牲畜两千一百多头，副业生产收入年达一亿多元。随着生产的发展，组员们的物质、文化生活，也不断提高，充分说明了畜牧业互助合作的优越性。组员们在学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务后，更提高了政治觉悟，现在积极为转为畜牧业生产合作社而努力。　　　　　新华社记者　张映华摄
    全组组员都按每个人的特长分工。这是负责放马的组员正在牧场上套马。这是互助组的新式马拉打草机和搂草机。
    随着生产的发展，组员们的物质、文化生活也有所提高。这是组员们在晚上休息时间开留声机，欣赏音乐。
    胡和勒泰畜牧生产互助组刚成立时只有三十二头牲畜，现在已有羊一千三百多只。
