    A soil and water conservation experimental zone has been established in Hetian District, Changting County, Fujian Province. This mountain was originally a bald mountain due to years of soil and water erosion. Last year, the people's government led farmers to plant Masson pine seedlings here, and this year they have already sprouted branches and leaves. Xinhua News Agency manuscript, photo by Ye Dakai
