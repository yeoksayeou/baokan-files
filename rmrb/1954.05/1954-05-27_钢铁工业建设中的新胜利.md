    New Victory in Steel Industry Construction
    Yi Feng, Cui Jun
    A new, modern steelmaking plant built by the No. 101 Steel Plant in the Southwest Region has been completed. The No. 2 open-hearth furnace produced its first heat of steel on May 8th, and the No. 1 open-hearth furnace has also been ignited and is being baked, ready to produce steel soon.
    The scale of the steelmaking plant is very large, second only to Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of hearth area. According to the engineering design capacity, the annual steel production is equivalent to the total production capacity of all steelmaking plants in the Southwest. In the past, the steel industry in the Southwest region had a larger steel rolling capacity than smelting capacity. Although the No. 101 Steel Plant had heavy rolling equipment capable of rolling heavy steel rails, angle steel, I-beams, channel steel, and other large steel products, the smelting capacity of the old steelmaking plant was too small. The annual steel production could only meet the rolling equipment's production needs for three months, and a large amount of steel billets had to be transported from Anshan and other places thousands of miles away. Long-distance transportation increased product costs and often delayed production, preventing the potential of the huge rolling equipment from being realized. Now, with the new steelmaking plant put into production, the potential of the No. 101 Steel Plant's huge rolling equipment will be realized, and it will be able to fully supply the needs of the construction industry in the Southwest region.
    The steelmaking plant is designed according to the model of the new Soviet-style open-hearth furnace, and the various equipment in the plant are arranged according to the future development needs of the No. 101 Steel Plant. The entire set of equipment in this new steelmaking plant is mechanized. The entire process, from feeding materials to casting ingots, transporting them to the rolling mill, and rolling them into steel, is all operated by machines. The open-hearth furnace consumes hundreds of tons of scrap steel and pig iron every day. These scrap steel and pig iron can be transported directly by train to the stockyard next to the steelmaking furnace. There is a mobile weighbridge on the railway line next to the stockyard. As long as the train passes the mobile weighbridge, the weight of the scrap steel and pig iron carried by each wagon can be accurately known. There is a magnetic crane in the stockyard that can lift thousands of kilograms of raw materials and send them to the feeding box in front of the steelmaking furnace. When the steelmaking furnace needs to be fed, there is a Soviet-style automatic feeding machine in front of the furnace that sends the raw materials into the furnace one by one. When the molten steel is ready to be tapped, the train first drags the ingot molds into the plant and places them in position, and the crane pours the boiling molten steel into the ingot molds, and then the train drags the poured steel ingots away to the rolling mill. Because of the mechanization of the production process in this new steelmaking plant, although it is several times larger than the old steelmaking plant of the No. 101 Steel Plant, the number of production workers is only half of that of the old plant. Due to the mechanization of the production process, the new steelmaking plant is preparing to receive female steelmaking workers.
    One of the important features of the new steelmaking plant is that it has good labor protection equipment. The open-hearth furnace is surrounded by circulating cooling water pipes. The heat emitted from the furnace wall is absorbed by the cooling water pipes, so that the temperature in the plant is not too high. The steel tapping port and the molten iron trough are also equipped with asbestos boards and blowers and other heat-resistant and cooling equipment. The gas furnace is equipped with anti-toxic and anti-ash equipment to ensure that workers are not harmed by gas and ash during operation, and workers can operate happily. Safety railings are installed in all dangerous places in the steelmaking plant.
    This steelmaking plant was designed by our own engineering and technical personnel under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. The various materials and most of the machinery and equipment used in the construction of the steelmaking plant were also manufactured by our own country.
    In the process of building this steelmaking plant, a large number of technical forces and management cadres for the design and construction of steelmaking plants have been trained for the country. Some of the trained design forces have participated in the construction of China's future steel industry base. More importantly, valuable and rich experience has been gained in the construction of this steelmaking plant, which is of great significance to the construction of China's steel industry.

    钢铁工业建设中的新胜利
    逸峰　崔均
    西南区一零一钢铁厂新建的一座近代化的炼钢场已经竣工，其中二号平炉于五月八日炼出了第一炉钢，一号平炉也已开始点火烘炉即将炼钢。
    炼钢场的规模是很大的，从炉底面积来看仅次于鞍钢。它每年所生产出的钢，按照工程设计能力计算，相当于全西南所有炼钢场生产能力的总和。过去，西南区的钢铁工业，轧钢能力大于冶炼能力。一零一厂虽然有着重型的轧钢设备，能够轧制重钢轨以及角钢、工字钢、槽钢等大型钢材，因为旧有炼钢场冶炼能力太小，一年所炼的钢仅供轧钢设备三个月的生产需要，大量的钢胚不得不从几千里远的鞍钢等地运来。长途运输增高了产品的成本，并经常耽误生产，使巨大的轧钢设备的潜力不能发挥。现在，这座炼钢场投入生产后，使一零一厂巨大的轧钢设备的潜力得到发挥，将能充分供应西南地区建设事业的需要。
    炼钢场是根据苏联新式炼钢炉的式样设计的，场内的各项设备都是按照一零一厂未来发展的需要进行布置的。这座新的炼钢场，全套设备是机械化的，从进料到浇成钢锭、运往轧钢场、轧制成钢材，整个过程全部用机器操作。炼钢平炉每天要吞进数百吨废钢生铁，这些废钢生铁可以由火车一直拉到炼钢炉旁边的堆料场上；堆料场旁边的铁路线上有一个活动地磅，只要火车经过了活动地磅，就可以准确地知道每节车皮所载废钢生铁的重量；堆料场上有一部磁力起重机，就能把数千斤的原料吊起送到炼钢炉前的进料盒中；等到炼钢炉需要进料时，在炉前有一部苏联最新式的自动化进料机，把原料逐次送到炉内；钢水要出炉了，火车先把钢锭模拖进场中摆好，吊车即把沸腾的钢水浇入钢锭模，然后火车再把浇好的钢锭拖走，送到轧钢车间。这座新炼钢场，由于生产过程的机械化，它虽然比一零一厂旧炼钢场大几倍，生产工人却只有旧场的一半。由于生产过程的机械化，新炼钢场正在准备接收女炼钢工人。
    新炼钢场重要的特点之一，是有着良好的劳动保护设备。平炉的四周都装有循环冷却水管，炉壁发射出来的热都被冷却水管所吸收，使场内温度不致太高，炉子的出钢口和铁水槽也都装有石棉板和鼓风机等防热降温设备。煤气炉装置有防毒、防灰的设备，保证工人在操作时不受煤气和煤灰的侵害，工人们可以愉快地操作。在炼钢场中，凡是有危险的地方，都装置了安全栏杆。
    这座炼钢场，是在苏联专家指导、帮助下，由我国工程技术人员自行设计的。建设炼钢场所用的各种器材和大部分的机器设备，也是由我国自己制造的。
    在这座炼钢场的建设过程中，为国家培养出了一大批建设炼钢场的设计、施工的技术力量和管理干部，培养出的设计力量中，有一部分已参加到我国未来钢铁工业基地的建设行列中。更重要的是，在这座炼钢场的建设中，取得了可贵的、丰富的经验，对我国钢铁工业建设有着重要的意义。
