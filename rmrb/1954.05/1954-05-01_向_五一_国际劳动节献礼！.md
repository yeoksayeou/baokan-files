    A Salute to the "May First" International Labour Day!
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 Blast Furnace and Other Units
    Fulfill Conditions for Competition to Greet "May First"
    The No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Steelmaking Workshop of the Tangshan Steel Plant, and the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have all overfulfilled the labor competition conditions to greet the "May First" Festival.
    The No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed the April national plan one day, ten hours, and thirteen minutes ahead of schedule. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 0.796, ensuring product quality, eliminating waste products, overfulfilling the plan to reduce coke ratio, and achieving safe production. The Steelmaking Workshop of the Tangshan Steel Plant completed the April national plan fifty-two hours ahead of schedule. The average daily output increased by 2.75% compared to the previous highest record, increasing production and saving 3.6 billion yuan. The No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant completed the April national plan sixty-three hours ahead of schedule. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 0.789, ensuring product quality, and reducing the coke ratio from 0.927 to 0.895.
    Daye Steel Plant Overfulfills Production Plan
    The staff and workers of the state-owned Central China Iron and Steel Company's Daye Steel Plant celebrated "May First" Labour Day by overfulfilling the April national production plan. The plant completed the plan for nine out of ten types of products, with pig iron reaching 102.8%, steel 102.4%, and steel products 108.7%. On April 28th, the Bessemer converter steelmaking set a new national record for the fourth time. The steelmaking performance on this day reached 128 furnaces. In early April, the Bessemer converter steelmaking workers of the Daye Steel Plant had proposed in their competition conditions: to greet their festival with an achievement of an average daily output of 100 furnaces of steel. Now, according to the statistics from April 1st to 28th, they have fulfilled their promise to the motherland with an excellent achievement of an average daily output of 103 furnaces of steel.
    Anshan Iron and Steel's New Thin Plate Plant to be Completed Ahead of Schedule
    By April 28th, 80% of the mechanical equipment of China's first modern thin plate rolling mill – the second thin plate rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel – had completed partial test runs, and some of the mechanical equipment had already begun to enter technical completion. These mechanical equipment, after inspection by Soviet experts, have all reached the required quality standards. After the start of the partial test runs, a labor competition was launched throughout the construction site to greet "May First" Labour Day. The workers participating in the installation of the finishing mill all demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, bringing the partial test run time forward by a full ten days compared to the original plan, which enabled the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company to overfulfill the April national plan.
    Completion of Iron Tower Project at Soviet Exhibition Center
    On the eve of "May First" Labour Day, a glittering gold-plated iron tower rose above the roof of the central hall of the Soviet Exhibition Center, with a brightly shining red star at the top of the tower.
    At 3:15 PM on April 29th, the crane operators at the Soviet Exhibition Center construction site began to slowly hoist the iron tower and red star, which were more than 40 meters high and weighed nearly 30 tons, from the roof of the central hall using steel cables. At 10:40 PM, the red star appeared in the western suburbs of the capital at a height of 86 meters, radiating dazzling light in all directions.
    In order to complete this arduous task before "May First", the workers created many miracles. Workers Zhou Lin and Gu A'mao experimented with red glass twelve times before they succeeded. The three workers who welded the iron tower stayed at the top of the dark iron tower for more than ten days to complete the welding task.
    After the iron tower was welded, the workers suggested gold-plating the tower to make it radiate gold forever. Five elderly workers around the age of seventy excitedly rushed to Beijing from their hometown overnight to take on the task of gold-plating, and completed it three days ahead of schedule.

    向“五一”国际劳动节献礼！
    石景山钢铁厂一高炉等单位
    完成迎接“五一”的竞赛条件
    北京石景山钢铁厂炼铁部第一高炉、唐山钢厂炼钢车间和太原钢铁厂炼铁部第一高炉三个单位，都超额完成了迎接“五一”节的劳动竞赛条件。
    石景山钢铁厂炼铁部第一高炉，已提前一天又十小时十三分完成了四月份国家计划，高炉利用系数达到零点七九六，保证了产品质量，消灭了废品，超额完成了降低焦比计划，做到了安全生产。唐山钢铁厂炼钢车间提前五十二小时完成了四月份国家计划，日平均生产量较以往最高纪录提高百分之二点七五，增产节约三十六亿元。太原钢铁厂炼铁部第一高炉提前六十三小时完成了四月份国家计划，高炉利用系数达到零点七八九，保证了产品质量，把焦比由零点九二七降低到零点八九五。
    大冶钢厂超额完成生产计划
    国营华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂职工以超额完成四月份国家生产计划庆祝“五一”劳动节。该厂十类产品有九类完成了计划，总计生铁完成百分之一零二点八，钢一零二点四，钢材一零八点七。在四月二十八日贝氏炉炼钢又创造了第四次全国新纪录。这天炼钢成绩达到一百二十八炉。四月初旬，大冶钢厂贝氏炉炼钢工人曾在自己的竞赛条件中提出：要以平均日产一百炉钢的成就，迎接自己的节日。现在根据四月一日到二十八日的统计，他们已经用平均日产一百零三炉钢的优异成绩，实践了自己对祖国提出的诺言。鞍钢新建薄板厂将提前竣工
    我国第一座新式的薄板轧制厂——鞍钢的第二薄板轧制厂，到四月二十八日为止，已有百分之八十的机械设备完成了局部试车，并有部分的机械设备已经开始进入技术竣工。这些机械设备，经苏联专家的检查，都达到了应有的质量标准。在进行局部试车开始后，全工地曾展开了迎接“五一”劳动节的劳动竞赛。参加安装精轧机的工人们，都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，把局部试车的时间，比原订计划提前了整整十天，这就使得机械安装工程公司超额地完成了四月份的国家计划。
    苏联展览馆铁塔工程竣工
    “五一”劳动节的前夕，在苏联展览馆中央大厅的楼顶上，升起了一座金光闪闪的镏金铁塔，铁塔尖上闪耀着一颗光芒灿烂的红星。
    四月二十九日下午三时一刻，苏联展览馆工地的起重工们开始用钢索把四十多公尺高、近三十吨重的铁塔和红星，徐徐地从中央大厅的楼顶上升起来。夜间十点四十分，红星出现在首都西郊八十六公尺的高空，向四面八方放射出夺目的光芒。
    为着在“五一”前完成这项艰巨的任务，工人们创造了许许多多的奇迹。工人周林和顾阿毛试制红玻璃试验了十二次，才告成功。焊接铁塔的三个工人钻在漆黑的铁塔顶端坚持了十几天，完成了铁塔焊接任务。
    铁塔焊接好了以后，工人们为了使这座铁塔永远放射着金光，就建议在铁塔上镏金。五位七十岁左右的老工人从家乡兴奋地连夜赶到北京来担负镏金的任务，并提前三天完成了。
