Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th: Some Indonesian political leaders told an Antara News Agency reporter: "Indonesia opposes all Pacific Pact Organizations and other military pacts." They said that Indonesia opposes the establishment of a military pact planned by the United States, and opposes Pacific pacts or other military agreements in which colonial countries participate. Such agreements are unacceptable to countries, including India and Indonesia, that pursue an independent foreign policy.

They believe that a collective security pact including all Asian countries should be established based on a policy of friendship and mutual non-aggression.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Political figures in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are deeply concerned about the attempts of Western colonial countries to disregard the interests of Asian countries. They emphasized that countries like Indonesia, India, and Burma were not invited to the Geneva Conference due to the opposition of Western countries. Jakarta political figures therefore suggest convening a special Asian conference.

Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo has been discussing the issue of convening a meeting in Jakarta with diplomats from various Asian countries in recent days. All Asian countries will be invited to attend this meeting to discuss the issue of restoring peace and security in Asia.

    印尼政治领袖主张建立亚洲集体安全公约
    反对美国策划的军事公约或殖民国家的其他军事协定
    【新华社雅加达十六日电】印尼一些政治领袖对安塔拉通讯社记者说：“印尼反对一切太平洋公约组织和其它军事公约。”他们说，印尼反对成立美国策划中的军事公约，反对殖民国家参加的太平洋公约或其他军事协定。这种协定是包括印度和印尼在内的奉行独立的外交政策的国家所不能接受的。
    他们认为，应该建立一个以友好和互不侵犯政策为基础的、包括所有亚洲国家的集体安全公约。
    据新华社讯：印尼首都雅加达政界人士对西方殖民国家企图无视亚洲国家的利益甚表忧虑。他们着重指出，由于西方国家的反对，像印度尼西亚、印度和缅甸这些国家都未被邀请出席日内瓦会议。雅加达政界人士因此建议召开一个亚洲特别会议。
    安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约最近几天已在和亚洲各国的外交家商议关于在雅加达召开会议的问题。所有亚洲国家将被邀请出席这个会议，来讨论恢复亚洲的和平和安全的问题。
