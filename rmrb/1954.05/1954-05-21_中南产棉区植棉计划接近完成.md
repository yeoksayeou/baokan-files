The cotton planting area in the Central South region has reached approximately 90% of the planned area. Among them, fifteen counties including Taikang in Henan Province and the Jiaozuo mining area have exceeded the cotton planting plan by an average of 6.2%, Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province has exceeded the plan by 29,000 mu, and Enshi Prefecture (mountain area) has exceeded the plan by 10,000 mu. The remaining areas that have not completed the cotton planting plan are working hard to complete it. Areas that have already finished sowing have launched seedling protection campaigns. Henan Province has launched a "three checks and one guarantee" campaign to check seedling emergence, check soil moisture, check germination, and guarantee full seedling establishment. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a cotton technology symposium on May 10th to specifically address the problem of preventing and controlling cotton pests. During the cotton sowing process, all regions emphasized intensive cultivation, and most regions have improved in terms of fertilization, promotion of improved varieties, seed dressing, seed selection, and close planting compared to previous years.

    中南产棉区植棉计划接近完成
    截至目前为止，中南区的植棉面积已达计划面积的百分之九十左右。其中河南省太康等十五个县及焦作矿区平均超过植棉计划百分之六点二，湖北省襄阳专区超过计划二万九千亩，恩施专区（山区）超过计划一万亩。尚未完成植棉计划的部分地区，正在努力争取完成。目前已经结束播种的地区，开展了保苗运动。河南省已开展了查出苗、查墒情、查发芽和保证全苗的“三查一保”运动。省农林厅五月十日召开了棉花技术座谈会，专门解决防治棉虫问题。各地在棉花播种过程中，都强调了精耕细作，在施肥、推广良种、拌种、选种、密植等方面，大部地区均比往年有所提高。
