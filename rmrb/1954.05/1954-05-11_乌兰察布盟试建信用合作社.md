    Ulanqab League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the People's Bank of China, plans to organize farmers and herdsmen throughout the league to establish forty-three credit cooperatives this year. In February, the branch convened financial cadres from various banners, counties, and districts to study and research the work of establishing credit cooperatives, and at the same time, organized agricultural and pastoral cadres in areas preparing to establish cooperatives to study documents on credit cooperatives. After studying, the local financial cadres went to Urad Front Banner to conduct trial establishment work. By late March, they had established a credit cooperative in Minsheng Township, Fifth District of the banner. After widely publicizing the role of credit cooperatives in conjunction with central tasks such as the general election, and educating farmers with the facts of past usury exploitation in the area, 365 farm households in the township joined the cooperative, accounting for 84 percent of the total households; the total share capital subscribed was more than 600 shares, amounting to over 18.4 million yuan. The financial cadres in various places gained a lot of experience in the trial establishment work. At present, the work of establishing credit cooperatives in the agricultural and pastoral areas of the league is being carried out gradually in a planned manner. (Huo Zhongyi)

    乌兰察布盟试建信用合作社
    中国人民银行内蒙古自治区乌兰察布盟支行今年计划组织全盟农民和牧民建立四十三个信用合作社。二月间，该行召集各旗、县、区金融干部学习、研究了建立信用合作社的工作，同时组织准备建社地区的农牧干部学习了关于信用合作社的文件。各地金融干部学习后，到乌拉特前旗进行了试建工作。三月下旬，他们已在该旗第五区民生乡建立了一个信用合作社。经过结合普选等中心工作广泛宣传了信用合作社的作用，用过去当地的高利贷剥削的事实向农民进行教育以后，全乡有三百六十五户农民入社，占总户数的百分之八十四；入股股金共六百多股，金额为一千八百四十余万元。各地金融干部在试建工作中吸取了不少经验，目前，该盟农业区和牧区建立信用合作社的工作，正在有计划地逐步展开。　　　（霍钟?）
