(By our Wuhan dispatch on the 19th) In order to maximize the effectiveness of national capital construction investment, the Central South First and Fourth Engineering Companies and the Wuhan First and Third Engineering Companies have begun to correct their business ideology and improve business management.

The First and Fourth Engineering Companies, under the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau, recently compiled plans for reducing construction engineering costs this year. The planned reduction in cost accounts for 11.3% to 13.2% of the total project cost. Compared with last year's Central South Region project cost budget quota, it can save the country 60 to 70 billion yuan in construction funds.

The main methods these two engineering companies use to guarantee the realization of the plan are to rely on the promotion of advanced experience and the improvement of business management. For example, in the use of cement, they plan to universally promote Soviet advanced experience, changing high-grade cement to low-grade cement, and changing volumetric ratios to weight ratios (after changing concrete to weight ratios, cement consumption can be reduced by 70 kilograms per cubic meter); using one-time smoothing for concrete plastering, etc. This saves cement and also guarantees quality. Therefore, cement alone can reduce the total cost by 2.24%. In order to improve labor efficiency, these two engineering companies decided to rationally adjust labor organization and make full use of mechanical equipment. In order to save administrative management costs and project costs, they also decided to implement fixed staffing and quotas, and establish pre-budget and final account systems, as well as systems for receiving, issuing, and storing tools.

The First and Third Engineering Companies, under the Wuhan Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, have also begun to improve the estimation and quotation work for construction projects and reduce costs after initially criticizing cadres' capitalist business ideologies such as "generous material calculations," "raising unit prices," and "overestimating freight." For example, in the past, the Wuhan First Engineering Company had a serious phenomenon of generous and excessive calculation of roundwood usage. This year, it has been reduced by 20% compared to the quota. In the material quotation work, the past chaotic phenomenon has been initially overcome, and in the calculation of transportation distance, the past phenomenon of "laying ambushes" has also begun to be eliminated. Due to the initial improvement of the cost estimation work, the project cost has been significantly reduced, and construction funds can be saved accordingly. For example, the cost per square meter of brick and wood structures by Wuhan First Engineering Company is 12% lower than last year, and the cost per square meter of mixed structures is 15% lower. Another example is the dormitory for employees of the Zhenhuan Yarn Factory contracted by the Wuhan Third Engineering Company. Because the estimators carefully calculated and reduced costs, the construction unit saved more than 800 million yuan from the original budget.

### 中南区及武汉市四个建筑工程公司  端正经营思想降低建设成本

    中南区及武汉市四个建筑工程公司
    端正经营思想降低建设成本
    【本报武汉十九日电】为使国家基本建设投资发挥最大效果，中南第一和第四工程公司及武汉市第一和第三工程公司开始端正经营思想，改进经营管理。
    中南建筑工程局所属第一和第四工程公司最近编制了今年降低建筑工程成本的计划，计划造价的降低额占全部工程总造价的百分之十一点三到百分之十三点二，和去年中南区工程成本预算定额比较，可为国家节约建设资金六、七百亿元。
    这两个工程公司保证实现计划的办法主要是依靠推广先进经验和改善经营管理。如在使用水泥方面，准备普遍推行苏联先进经验，把高标号改为低标号，把体积比改为重量比（混凝土改重量比后每立方公尺可减少水泥用量七十公斤）；混凝土抹面采用一次抹光等，这样既节约了水泥，还可保证质量。因此，仅水泥一项，就可降低总造价百分之二点二四。为了提高劳动效率，这两个工程公司决定合理调整劳动组织，尽量利用机械设备。为了节约行政管理费用和工程费用，还决定实行定员定额，建立预决算制度和收发、领用、保管工具的制度。
    武汉市建筑工程局所属第一和第三工程公司在初步批判了干部“宽打工料”、“提高单价”、“重估运费”等资本主义经营思想后，也开始改进建设工程中工料估价和报价工作，降低了造价。如武汉市第一工程公司过去在圆木料用量上宽打多算现象很严重，今年则比定额降低了百分之二十。在材料报价工作中，初步克服了过去的混乱现象，在运输距离计算上，也开始消灭了过去“打埋伏”的现象。由于初步改进了造价工作，工程成本显著降低，建设资金可以相应节省。如武汉市第一工程公司砖木结构每平方造价比去年降低百分之十二，混合结构每平方造价降低百分之十五。又如武汉市第三工程公司承建的震寰纱厂职工宿舍，因为估算人员认真计算，降低造价，使兴建单位从原预算资金中节约了八亿多元。
