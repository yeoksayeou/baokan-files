    Zhejiang Province to Establish Agricultural Technology Extension Stations in Twenty-Two Counties This Year
    In order to strengthen agricultural technical guidance, the agricultural leadership organs of Zhejiang Province plan to establish agricultural technology extension stations in twenty-two counties, including Xiaoshan and Lishui, this year. According to local production needs, silkworm and mulberry technology extension stations will be established in nine counties, including Wuxing, Haining, and Chongde; cotton and hemp technology extension stations will be established in four counties, including Xiaoshan and Yuyao; livestock breeding stations will be established in four counties, including Shengxian and Tiantai; aquatic technology extension stations will be established in five areas, including Shenjiamen and Haimen; and specialty technology extension stations will be established in seven counties, including Haiyan, Xinchang, and Yuhang. In addition, a citrus technology extension station will be established separately in Huangyan County, and a tea industry technology extension station will be established in Shengxian County. In other areas where technology extension stations have not been established, various agricultural and specialized technical extension groups will be set up under the local agricultural and forestry institutions according to work needs.
    At present, in addition to the three counties of Xiaoshan, Lishui, and Chun'an, which have already started construction, the remaining areas preparing to build stations are carrying out preparatory work and will soon be formally established. (Xu Yaozu)
