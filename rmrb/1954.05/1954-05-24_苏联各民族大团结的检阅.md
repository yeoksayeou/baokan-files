    Review of the Great Unity of All Nationalities of the Soviet Union
    By our correspondent Li He
    The people of all nationalities of the sixteen Soviet Union republics joyfully celebrate the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia.

    In these days, people living anywhere in the Soviet Union, speaking any national language, cannot help but feel that they are living in a socialist family of such friendly nationalities, and cannot help but feel that the unity of all nationalities is such a powerful force in building socialism and communism. This great friendship and unity was generated and grew in the common bloody struggle of all nationalities of the Soviet Union against foreign invaders, against Tsarist autocracy, and against the exploitation of landlords and the bourgeoisie; it was tempered and consolidated in their joint battles to defend the Soviet regime and defend the motherland, and in their joint labor to build a new society.

    In this grand festival, in the cities and villages of Ukraine, Russia, and other republics, congratulations to the Russian and Ukrainian nationalities are resounding everywhere, because their three hundred years of unity and friendship are the best example for all nationalities of the Soviet Union. In these days, everything related to the name of Ukraine particularly arouses people's affection and love. People pay special attention to the prosperous situation of the Ukrainian Republic. After the Patriotic War, with the help of Russia and all nationalities of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian people not only restored the republic's national economy, but also greatly exceeded its pre-war level. Ukraine is not only the granary of the Soviet Union but also an industrialized republic. In terms of coal mining, mining, iron production, steel production, tractor manufacturing, and the manufacturing of many machines, Ukraine far exceeds larger capitalist countries such as France and Italy. Ukraine currently has 6.5 million primary and secondary school students and more than 177,000 university students, which is more than any capitalist country in Western Europe. The Ukrainian Republic is the most beautiful part of the prosperous Soviet socialist garden.

    Russians and Ukrainians, and all nationalities of the Soviet Union, greeted this national festival with common labor and cultural exchanges. Machine-building workers in Moscow and Lviv, metallurgical workers in the Urals and Donbas, hardware workers in Leningrad and Dnepropetrovsk, tractor-building workers in Altai and Kharkiv, construction workers at the Angara Hydropower Station and the Kakhovka Irrigation Project, farmers in the Tula and Khmelnytskyi regions, and many enterprises and collectives, sent congratulatory telegrams to each other, sent delegations to each other, and conducted socialist competitions. Close mutual assistance and cooperation were demonstrated in the competition. In Moscow, a "Decade of Ukrainian Literature and Art" was held, and in Kiev, a "Decade of Russian Literature and Art" was held. These Decades of Literature and Art demonstrated the close and firm connection between the two major cultures, with socialism as the content and the nation as the form.

    On the 22nd, a commemorative meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Republic was held in Kiev, with delegations from Russia and other Soviet republics participating. On the 23rd, a military parade was held in Kiev and five other cities in Ukraine. In Moscow, commemorative meetings were held in various district soviets, factories, institutions, universities, and middle schools, and the entire city was dressed in festive attire; grand public entertainment was held in all parks, sports venues, and squares on the 23rd. A military parade will be held in Moscow on the 30th.

    The people of the entire Soviet Union are participating in this review of the great unity of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. This unbreakable unity and friendship of the people of all nationalities under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is one of the reliable guarantees for the smooth construction of a communist society in the Soviet Union.

    苏联各民族大团结的检阅
    本报记者　李何
    苏联十六个加盟共和国各族人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年纪念。
    在这些日子里，住在苏联任何地方，说着任何民族语言的人们，都不能不感觉到自己是生活在一个社会主义各民族多么友好的大家庭里，都不能不感觉到各族人民的团结是建设社会主义和共产主义社会多么强大的力量。这种伟大的友好团结，是苏联各族人民在反对外来侵略者，反对沙皇专制和反对地主阶级和资产阶级剥削的共同流血斗争中产生和成长的；是他们在保卫苏维埃政权、保卫祖国的并肩作战中，在建设新社会的合力劳动中锻炼和巩固的。
    在这盛大的节日中，在乌克兰、俄罗斯和其他共和国的城市和乡村，到处响亮着向俄罗斯和乌克兰两民族致敬的祝辞，因为它们三百年来的团结友好是苏联各民族的最好榜样。在这些日子里，一切与乌克兰名字有关的事物，特别引起人们亲切的喜爱。人们格外注意乌克兰共和国繁荣的情景。在卫国战争以后，在俄罗斯和苏联各族人民的帮助下，乌克兰人民不但恢复了共和国的国民经济，而且使它大大超过战前水平。乌克兰不仅是苏联的谷仓而且是工业化的共和国。从采煤、采矿、产铁、产钢、制造拖拉机和许多机器来说，乌克兰远远超过像法国、意大利这些较大的资本主义国家。乌克兰现有六百五十万中小学生，一十七万七千多大学生，比西欧任何资本主义国家都要多，乌克兰共和国是繁荣的苏联社会主义大花园中最美丽的部分。
    俄罗斯人和乌克兰人，苏联的各族人民，以共同的劳动，以文化的交流，迎接了这全民的节日。莫斯科和罗窝夫的机器制造工人，乌拉尔和顿巴斯的冶金工人，列宁格勒和第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克的五金工人，阿尔泰和哈尔科夫的拖拉机制造工人，安加拉水电站和卡霍夫水利工程的建筑工人，土拉州和赫米尔尼茨基州的农民，许许多多企业的集体，互致贺电、互派代表团和进行了社会主义竞赛。在竞赛中表现了亲密的互助和合作。在莫斯科，举行了“乌克兰文学和艺术旬”，在基辅举行了“俄罗斯文学和艺术旬”、在这文学和艺术旬中表现了以社会主义为内容和以民族为形式的两大文化的紧密牢固的联系。
    在基辅，二十二日召开了乌克兰共和国最高苏维埃纪念会议，俄罗斯和苏联其他共和国都有代表团参加。在基辅和乌克兰的其他五个城市，二十三日举行阅兵。在莫斯科，各个区苏维埃以及工厂、机关、大学、中学都举行了纪念会，全市都穿上了节日衣裳；所有公园、运动场所、广场二十三日举行盛大的大众娱乐。三十日莫斯科将举行阅兵。
    苏联全国人民都参加这次苏联各民族大团结的检阅。这种在苏联共产党领导下的各民族人民的牢不可破的团结友好，是苏联顺利地建设共产主义社会的可靠保证之一。
