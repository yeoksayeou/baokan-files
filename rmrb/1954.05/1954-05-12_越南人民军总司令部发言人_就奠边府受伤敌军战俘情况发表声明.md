Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 11th: The spokesperson of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement at a press conference regarding the condition of wounded enemy prisoners of war at Dien Bien Phu, according to the Vietnam News Agency on May 11th:

    After the Vietnam People's Army completely occupied the French military group stronghold at Dien Bien Phu, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army immediately issued an order to all units of the Vietnam People's Army occupying the central area of Muong Thanh to ensure the safety of wounded enemy prisoners of war and provide them with appropriate care.

    Subsequently, the commander of the Vietnam People's Army at Dien Bien Phu dispatched a representative of the People's Army and a military doctor from the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to visit the underground wounded soldier medical stations in Dien Bien Phu to see the wounded prisoners of war from the French Foreign Legion and North African troops who are currently receiving medical treatment there. The representative of the Vietnam People's Army explained to the prisoners of war the lenient policy of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards prisoners.

    All members of the enemy's medical team, from nurses to the colonel doctor, were allowed to return to the medical stations to care for their wounded.

    At the same time, Vietnamese People's Army medical personnel are doing everything possible to improve the condition of the wounded enemy prisoners of war.

    The humane treatment of wounded enemy prisoners of war by the Vietnam People's Army once again proves the lenient policy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Conversely, the imperialist aggressors inhumanely abuse wounded prisoners of war of the Vietnam People's Army and even barbarically murder unarmed civilians.

    越南人民军总司令部发言人
    就奠边府受伤敌军战俘情况发表声明
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社十一日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人在记者招待会上就奠边府敌军受伤战俘情况发表声明说：
    在越南人民军完全占领了奠边府法军集团据点之后，越南人民军总司令部立即通令占领芒清中央地区的越南人民军各部队，保障受伤敌军战俘的安全，并给予他们适当的照顾。
    接着，奠边府越南人民军司令派遣了一位人民军的代表和越南人民军总司令部的一位军医前往奠边府各地下伤兵医疗所，探望目前正在那里受到医药治疗的法军外籍军团和北非军中的受伤战俘。越南人民军的代表向战俘解释了胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府对俘虏的宽大政策。
    敌军医疗队的全体人员，从护士到上校军医，都被准许回到医疗所去照料他们的伤员。
    同时，越南人民军医务人员正在尽一切办法改善敌军受伤战俘的境况。
    越南人民军对敌军受伤战俘的人道待遇，再一次证明了越南民主共和国政府的宽大政策。相反的，帝国主义侵略者惨无人道地虐待越南人民军的受伤战俘，甚至野蛮地杀害手无寸铁的平民。
