Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 2nd (By our special correspondent Shen Jiantu) The Geneva Conference, discussing solutions to Asian problems, held its first recess on Labor Day after five days of meetings. May 2nd, being a Sunday, also saw no meetings held.

The Geneva Conference, which the world is closely watching, hoping it will resolve the urgent problems of Asia—the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese issues—has had a good start thanks to the first concrete and positive proposal by Foreign Minister Nam Il for the reunification and independence of Korea. Nam Il's proposal was supported by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov, who considered it the basis for resolving the Korean issue, a resolution that would bring peace to Korea.

However, after only five meetings, the US spokesman announced at a press conference on the 30th that the head of the US delegation, Dulles, would leave the city next Monday (May 3rd). This action was taken after the US's attempts to force its "allies" into submission and prevent a possible solution to the Korean and Indochinese problems showed increasing signs of failure. Most journalists here realize that Dulles's heavy-handed tactics have been met with a lukewarm response and will further isolate the United States.

The failure of Washington's usual "fait accompli" strategy before the Geneva Conference clearly did not serve as an education for Dulles himself.

Before the conference, Dulles intended to use a "joint declaration" to bind Britain, France, and other countries participating in the conference. He did not succeed.

His call for "united action" was met with a cold response. The New York Herald Tribune admitted that Britain had put the Eisenhower administration in a state of "near-desperate failure" on the Indochina issue. Dulles's provocative statement upon arrival at the Geneva airport was not welcomed.

At the conference, Dulles's speech on the Korean issue also did not arouse much interest among the countries that participated in the Korean War under the command of the United Nations Command. The South Korean Foreign Minister, Byun Yung-tai, whom Dulles expected to speak for South Korea, gave a rude speech, already familiar to the world from the warmongering Syngman Rhee, opposing free elections throughout Korea and opposing the withdrawal of US troops, making a fool of himself at the meeting. Only Colombia, Thailand, and Turkey echoed the United States, talking about utilizing "the power of the United Nations" to turn Korea into a US colony. Australian Foreign Minister Casey repeated the US arguments but also said that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal "needs careful consideration."

Bidault and Eden have not yet spoken.

Fewer and fewer journalists are attending the press conferences held by the US delegation each day. On the fifth day of the conference, only about forty out of nearly two thousand journalists attended the US press conference. Press conferences held by the Chinese and Soviet delegations attracted the majority of journalists. Even die-hard American journalists found it difficult to propagate Dulles's claim that American troops could not leave Korea because they had traveled five thousand miles to fight in Korea.

The sudden announcement of Dulles's departure from the Geneva Conference may be related to these facts. However, this announcement confirmed what newspaper commentators said—that Dulles is unwilling to reach an agreement to ease tensions in the Far East and the world. His departure may also indicate that Dulles will do everything he can to disrupt the Geneva Conference whenever he pleases.

However, Mr. Dulles has failed to hinder the progress of history. Washington has made painstaking efforts to slander the People's Republic of China and prevent it from participating in international affairs, but it has failed. The People's Republic of China has achieved its due legitimate position among the great powers in Geneva and expressed its views at the first international conference held by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China, and representatives of other countries to ease tensions and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.

At the conference, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai expressed the Asian people's desire for peace and security and supported Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea within six months. He upheld the principle of allowing Asians to solve their own problems without any foreign interference. This firm stance has attracted great attention and widespread response. He expressed regret that India, Indonesia, and Burma were unable to participate in the conference discussing Asian issues.

Public opinion has also noted that Dulles made no mention in his speech of the need for more Asian countries to participate in the conference. Dulles's open refusal to withdraw foreign troops from Korea, thereby allowing the Korean people to hold free elections without foreign interference, clearly shows that the tension and instability in the East are due to the US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries and placing them under US colonial rule. The main obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is the United States' refusal to allow the Korean people to choose their own way of life.

So far, only the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union have put forward positive and concrete proposals at the conference. The United States has only played a negative role. Dulles's only speech at the conference was, in effect, a demand that the Korean people submit to the "United Nations General Assembly resolution of October 7, 1950," which the United States had failed to achieve with the military force of sixteen countries for three years. No wonder Western journalists shrugged their shoulders and walked away as soon as they read Dulles's speech in the press building.

The New York Herald Tribune commented on Dulles's obviously unacceptable proposal and Dulles's situation. Lippmann, in an article titled "The Weakness of the Geneva Conference" in the newspaper, said: "The United States is in a very difficult position at the Geneva Conference because important Republican senators have no other conditions for peace than demanding unconditional surrender from the enemy, and they do not advocate American participation in the war unless collective action is taken, which no one is willing to participate in now." He also said: "Therefore, the Secretary of State had better consider leaving the meeting and letting the United States temporarily step aside."

Dulles's withdrawal from the conference precisely after the discussion of the Korean issue began and before the Indochina issue was discussed clearly indicates that the United States is currently unwilling to see rapid progress and resolution of various urgent issues. As Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out: "The Geneva Conference will only achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue if it proceeds on the principle that Asian people have the full right to solve their own affairs themselves and that this is primarily their own business." The success of the Geneva Conference, which the world expects, depends on the extent to which this principle is respected and implemented at the conference.

### 新华社记者评五天以来的日内瓦会议

    新华社记者评五天以来的日内瓦会议
   【新华社日内瓦二日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：讨论亚洲问题的解决办法的日内瓦会议举行了五天以后，在“五一”节第一次休会，五月二日是星期日也不举行会议。
    全世界都集中注意地希望它能解决亚洲的迫切问题——朝鲜和印度支那问题的和平解决——的日内瓦会议，由于南日外务相提出的恢复朝鲜统一与独立的第一个具体的积极建议，已有了良好的开端。南日的建议得到了周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长的支持，他们认为这是解决朝鲜问题的基础，朝鲜问题的解决将为朝鲜带来和平。
    但是，仅仅在举行了五次会议以后，美国发言人三十日就在记者招待会上宣布，美国代表团团长杜勒斯将在下星期一（五月三日）离开此地。这个行动是在美国使它的“盟国”就范、并防止朝鲜和印度支那问题的可能解决的企图日益显出失败的迹象以后采取的。此间大多数记者都认识到，杜勒斯的高压手段得到了冷淡的反应，而且将促使美国更加孤立。
    在日内瓦会议召开以前，华盛顿所惯用的“既成事实”的策略的失败，对杜勒斯本人显然没有起什么教育作用。
    在会议召开以前，杜勒斯曾打算用“联合宣言”来约束英国、法国和参加会议的其他国家。他没有成功。
    他的“联合行动”的号召得到了冷漠的反应。纽约“先驱论坛报”承认，英国已使艾森豪威尔政府在印度支那问题上陷于“接近于绝望的失败”之中。杜勒斯在到达日内瓦机场时的挑衅的声明没有受到欢迎。
    在会议上，杜勒斯关于朝鲜问题的发言，也没有引起在联合国军司令部指挥下参加朝鲜战争的国家的很大兴趣。杜勒斯指望能代表南朝鲜发言的南朝鲜外务部长官卞荣泰，发表了一篇全世界已经从好战的李承晚口中听惯了的反对举行全朝鲜自由选举和不要美军撤退的粗鲁不堪的演说，在会上出了洋相。只有哥伦比亚、泰国和土耳其附和美国，谈到了利用“联合国的权力”把朝鲜变成美国殖民地。澳大利亚外长凯西重复了美国的论调，但又说外务相南日的建议“需要加以慎重的考虑”。
    皮杜尔和艾登还没有发言。
    参加美国代表团所举行的记者招待会的记者一天比一天少了。会议的第五天，在将近两千个记者中只有四十个左右参加美国的记者招待会。中国和苏联代表团举行的记者招待会吸引了大多数记者。甚至顽固的美国记者也认为难以传布杜勒斯的说法：美国军队不能撤离朝鲜，因为他们是从五千哩以外去到朝鲜作战的。
    美国突然宣布杜勒斯离开日内瓦会议一事或许和这些事实不无关连。但是，这个宣布证实了报纸评论所说的——杜勒斯不愿获致协议来缓和远东和世界紧张局势。他的离开也可说明，杜勒斯什么时候高兴破坏日内瓦会议，他就会不顾一切地破坏它。
    但是，杜勒斯先生未能阻挠历史的前进。华盛顿费尽心机来诽谤中华人民共和国，并阻挠它参加国际事务，但是失败了。中华人民共和国在日内瓦取得了在大国中应有的合法的地位，并在苏联、美国、法国、英国和中华人民共和国五国外长和其他国家代表为缓和紧张局势和巩固远东与世界和平而举行的第一个国际会议上发表了它的意见。
    在会议上，周恩来外长表达了亚洲人民对和平与安全的愿望，并支持南日外务相的所有外国军队在六个月内撤离朝鲜的建议。他维护让亚洲人在没有任何外国的干涉下解决他们自己的问题的原则。这种坚决的立场，引起了极大的注意和广泛的反应。他对印度、印尼和缅甸这些亚洲国家未能参加讨论亚洲问题的会议一事表示遗憾。
    舆论也注意到，杜勒斯在发言中丝毫没有提到更多的亚洲国家参加会议的必要性。杜勒斯公开拒绝外国军队撤离朝鲜从而让朝鲜人民在没有外力干涉的条件下举行自由选举一事，清楚地说明了东方局势之所以紧张和不稳定，是由于美国执行干涉亚洲国家内政和把它们置于美国殖民统治之下的政策。朝鲜问题和平解决的主要障碍，是美国不让朝鲜人民选择他们自己的生活方式。
    到目前为止，只有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联在会议上提出了积极而具体的建议。美国只发生了消极的作用。杜勒斯在会议上唯一的一次发言，实际上是要求朝鲜人民屈从美国在三年来用了十六个国家的武力都没有实现的“一九五○年十月七日联合国大会的决议”。无怪乎西方的记者们在记者大厦里一读到杜勒斯的演说辞时都耸了肩膀走开了。
    纽约“先驱论坛报”上评述了杜勒斯这种显然不能接受的建议以及杜勒斯的处境。李普曼以“日内瓦会议的弱点”为题在该报发表评论说：“美国在日内瓦会议上的处境非常困难，因为共和党的重要的参议员除了要求敌人无条件投降以外没有其他的和平条件，他们又不主张美国参加战争，除非采取现在任何人都不愿意参加的集体行动。”他又说：“因此，国务卿最好考虑离开会议，让美国暂时闪在一边。”
    杜勒斯恰恰在开始讨论朝鲜问题以后和还没有讨论印度支那问题以前退出会议，很明显地表示美国在目前是不愿意各项急迫的问题获得迅速的进展和解决的。诚如苏联外长莫洛托夫所指出的：“如果日内瓦会议本着亚洲人民完全有权利来自己解决自己的事情而且这首先是他们自己的事情的原则”，日内瓦会议才会使朝鲜问题得到和平的解决。全世界所期望的日内瓦会议的成功，取决于这一原则在会议上被尊重和被执行的程度。
