Henan Province has discovered summer locusts, and the Henan Provincial People's Government is actively leading the prevention and control work.

The area in Henan Province where locust eggs have been discovered is approximately 480,000 mu; among which, over 200,900 mu have 3 to 10 egg masses per square zhang, and hatching began in late April. Currently, locust nymphs in Shangshui County have spread to 80,000 mu, with 2,000 to 3,000 locust nymphs per square zhang in 6,000 mu, and generally 500 to 1,000 locust nymphs per square zhang. Eighty percent of the locust nymphs have reached the second instar. In locust areas such as Shangcai, Suiping, Xiping, Changyuan, and Puyang, locust eggs have begun and are about to hatch. It is expected that after mid-May, summer locusts throughout the province may hatch in large numbers.

In order to eliminate summer locusts before the third instar, the Henan Provincial People's Government has actively led the prevention and control work. Currently, a batch of pesticides, machinery, and other prevention and control materials have been allocated to the locust areas, and 4,000 technical cadres have been trained to support locust eradication in various places. In addition, the following prevention and control measures have been proposed: First, counties and districts with locusts should promptly establish locust control headquarters and send cadres to the locust areas to organize and mobilize the masses to eradicate locusts. Second, pay attention to organizing reconnaissance, intensify investigation of locust egg hatching, and report in a timely manner. Third, continue to train locust control personnel and repair machinery. Fourth, if it is found that locust nymphs have reached a later instar, and pesticides and machinery cannot be delivered in time or are insufficient, the masses should be resolutely organized to use manual methods to eliminate them, without waiting for pesticides and machinery.

    河南省人民政府积极领导防治夏蝗的工作
    河南省已发现夏蝗，河南省人民政府正积极领导进行防治工作。
    河南省现已发现有蝗卵地区的面积约为四十八万亩；其中二十万零九千多亩每方丈有卵袋三至十个，四月下旬已开始孵化出土。目前，商水县的蝗蝻已蔓延八万亩，其中六千亩每方丈有蝗蝻二千至三千个，一般的每方丈有五百个至一千个。现有百分之八十的蝗蝻已到二龄。上蔡、遂平、西平、长垣、濮阳等有蝗地区的蝗卵已开始和即将出土。预计五月中旬以后，全省的夏蝗可能大量孵化出土。
    河南省人民政府为了将夏蝗消灭在三龄以前，积极领导进行了防治工作。目前，已调拨到蝗区一批药械等防治物品，并训练技术干部四千人，支援各地灭蝗。此外，还提出了以下的防治措施：第一、有蝗县、区应从速建立治蝗指挥部，并派干部赴蝗区组织和发动群众灭蝗。第二、注意组织侦察，加紧调查蝗卵孵化情况，并及时汇报。第三、继续训练治蝗人员，并检修器械。第四、发现蝗蝻已升龄，而药械不能及时运到或不敷应用时，应坚决组织群众用人工方法扑灭，不要等待药械。
