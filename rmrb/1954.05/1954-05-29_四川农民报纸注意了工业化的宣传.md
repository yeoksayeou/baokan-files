    Sichuan Farmer Newspapers Pay Attention to Industrialization Propaganda
    On April 28th, Sichuan Daily published a newspaper work review titled "Prefectural Newspapers Begin to Strengthen Propaganda to Peasants on Socialist Industrialization," reviewing the propaganda on socialist industrialization in prefectural farmer newspapers such as "Masses News" (Fuling), "Nanchong News," "Chuannan News," and "Wanxian News."
    The review pointed out that since the launch of the general line propaganda, prefectural newspapers in Sichuan Province have begun to pay attention to and strengthen the propaganda and reports on national industrial construction. For example, "Masses News" published a total of eighty-two reports on industrial construction in the first quarter of this year, enabling peasants to regularly learn about the vigorous development of national industrial construction from the newspapers. "Chuannan News" used titles such as "Heavy Industry is the Lifeline, Refining Large Quantities of Steel and Iron," "Machine Industry is Very Important, It Turns Steel and Iron into Machines," "Fuel Industry is the Power, Relying Entirely on it to Turn Machines," "Railways Have Been Built for Over a Thousand Li, Improving Urban and Rural Transportation," and "Textile Industry is Also Developing, Producing More Cloth at Lower Prices," vividly describing the great achievements of China's industrial construction last year. "Wanxian News" also opened small columns such as "Workers Help Peasants Develop Production" and "New Discoveries of Underground Treasures," reflecting the face of national economic construction from various aspects. Farmer newspapers paying attention to industrialization propaganda can more profoundly promote the general line and more effectively guide peasants onto the socialist road.
    Of course, strengthening the propaganda of socialist industrialization does not require farmer newspapers to report on industry every day in lengthy or isolated ways. Regarding this point, Sichuan Daily pointed out in the review that it is important for farmer newspapers to promote the leading role of industry, promote the relationship between developing agriculture and developing industry, and better explain the relationship between the socialist transformation of agriculture and the country's socialist industrialization. The review used the example of "Masses News" for illustration. Since the beginning of this year, "Masses News" has not only paid attention to reporting national industrial construction news, but also paid attention to reporting news such as the power generation of the Shangdong Hydropower Station in Changshou County in the district, the completion of the Duzhou Township Pumping Station, and the establishment of a hydropower station in Longxi River, and explained in detail the benefits of these constructions to the country and to the local peasants. Because these new constructions reported by the newspaper in the region are visible and audible to the local peasants, they can more enable the peasants to recognize the importance of socialist industrialization from their personal life experience. Secondly, "Masses News" also paid attention to connecting the peasants' daily labor with the country's industrial construction in its propaganda. For example, the "Overcoming Drought is a Practical Action to Build Socialism Through Hard Struggle" published in March linked overcoming drought to strive for increased production and the task of increasing the total grain output of Sichuan Province by 6% compared to 1953, with the completion of the construction of the country's 141 key projects, telling the peasants that doing a good job in water conservancy not only relates to their own food and clothing for the year, but also relates to the early realization of socialism. Such drought prevention mobilization is vivid and powerful. In addition, the newspaper also published a picture column of the "New and Old Agricultural Implement Exhibition," vividly comparing the effectiveness of new and old agricultural implements, promoting the principle that the development of agriculture cannot be separated from the leadership and assistance of industry; and used a question-and-answer format to explain the common questions among peasants such as "Can machines be used in mountainous areas in the future?" and "What if we can't use machines?" The review pointed out that because "Masses News" can publicize socialist industrialization in a popular way that is easily accepted by peasants according to the peasants' ideological situation and production activities, this propaganda has been relatively successful.
    The efforts made by farmer newspapers in various prefectures in Sichuan in promoting industrialization are worth encouraging. Sichuan Daily's use of newspaper work reviews to systematically analyze the propaganda situation of various newspapers is a beneficial help to farmer newspapers. (Wan Chun)

    四川农民报纸注意了工业化的宣传
    四川日报在四月二十八日发表了一篇题为“专区报纸开始加强向农民宣传社会主义工业化”的报纸工作述评，评述了“群众报”（涪陵）、“南充报”、“川南报”和“万县报”等专区农民报纸关于社会主义工业化的宣传。
    述评指出，自开展总路线宣传以来，四川省的专区报纸开始重视和加强了对国家工业建设的宣传报道。例如，“群众报”在今年第一季度共发表了八十二篇有关工业建设的报道，使农民能够经常地从报纸上知道国家工业建设蓬勃开展的情况。“川南报”用了“重工业是命根子，炼出大批钢和铁”、
  “机器工业很重要，它把钢铁变机器”、“燃料工业是动力，全靠它来转机器”、“铁路修了千多里，城乡交通好便利”、“纺织工业也发展，出产布多价又廉”等题目，生动地叙述了去年我国工业建设的伟大成就。“万县报”也辟了“工人帮助农民发展生产”、“地下宝藏的新发现”等小专栏，从多方面反映国家经济建设的面貌。农民报纸重视了工业化的宣传，就能更深刻地宣传总路线，更有力地引导农民走社会主义道路。
    当然，加强社会主义工业化的宣传，并不是要求农民报纸天天连篇累牍地或孤立地报道工业。关于这一点，四川日报在述评中指出，重要的是农民报纸要宣传工业的领导作用，宣传发展农业和发展工业的关系，更好地说明农业的社会主义改造与国家的社会主义工业化的关系。述评用“群众报”的例子作了说明。今年以来，“群众报”既注意报道了全国性的工业建设消息，又注意报道了该区长寿县上硐水力发电站发电、渡舟乡抽水机站修建完工、龙溪河建立水力发电站等消息，并详细说明了这些建设对国家和对当地农民的利益。由于报纸报道的本地区的这些新建设，都是当地农民看得见听得到的，因而更能使农民由切身生活的体验中认识社会主义工业化的重要。其次，“群众报”在宣传中还注意把农民的日常劳动和国家的工业建设联系起来。如三月份发表的“战胜干旱，是艰苦奋斗建设社会主义的实际行动”，把战胜天旱争取增产和四川省今年全省粮食总产量较一九五三年增产百分之六的任务，和完成国家一百四十一项重点工程的建设联系起来，告诉农民搞好水利工作不但关系到自己一年吃饭穿衣，而且关系到社会主义的早日实现。这样的防旱动员是生动有力的。此外，该报还刊登了“新旧农具展览会”的图片专栏，形象地对比了新旧农具的功效，宣传了发展农业离不开工业的领导和帮助的道理；并用问答的形式解释了农民中普遍存在的“山地将来能不能用机器”、“我们用不来机器怎么办”等疑问。述评指出，由于“群众报”能够根据农民群众的思想状况和生产活动，用容易为农民接受的方式通俗地宣传了社会主义工业化，因此这一宣传就做得比较有成绩。
    四川各专区农民报纸在宣传工业化方面所作的努力，是值得鼓励的。四川日报采用报纸工作述评的方式来比较系统地分析各报的宣传情况，对于农民报纸是一种有益的帮助。（万春）
