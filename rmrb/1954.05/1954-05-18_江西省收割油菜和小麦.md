Farmers in Jiangxi Province are currently harvesting rapeseed and wheat. The harvesting work in the upper reaches of the Gan River area has been largely completed. In the lower reaches of the Gan River, near Poyang Lake, the wheat is almost ripe and the rapeseed has formed seeds, and harvesting is about to begin.

This year, Jiangxi Province sowed more than 1.9 million mu of wheat and more than 2.7 million mu of rapeseed. The wheat area was expanded by 190,000 mu compared to last year, and the harvest is generally expected to be better than last year. The rapeseed harvest in some areas is also better than last year. The rapeseed sown by the state-owned farms in Yudu and Shicheng counties has increased production by nearly 40% compared to last year. The ten mu of rapeseed sown by the Nankang Farm yielded an average of 85 jin of seeds per mu, exceeding the original plan by 40%. The Gaoxiang Mutual Aid Team in Houyang Township, Shangrao County, has begun harvesting wheat, and it is estimated that the average yield per mu can reach a maximum of 220 jin and a minimum of 150 jin.

    江西省收割油菜和小麦
    江西省农民现正收割油菜和小麦。赣江上游地区收割工作已基本结束。赣江下游鄱阳湖滨地方，小麦已近黄熟，油菜亦已结籽，即将开始收割。
    江西省今年播种了小麦一百九十多万亩，油菜二百七十多万亩。小麦比去年扩大了十九万亩，收成一般将比去年好。油菜收成有些地方亦比去年好。雩都及石城县国营农场播种的油菜，比去年增产近百分之四十。南康农场播种的十亩油菜，每亩平均收籽八十五斤，超过原计划百分之四十。上饶县后洋乡高祥互助组的小麦正开始收割，估计每亩平均产量最高的可达二百二十斤，最差的亦有一百五十斤。
