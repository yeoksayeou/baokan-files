    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions to the entire army on strengthening leadership over the New Democratic Youth League. The instructions first pointed out: During the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Youth League organizations in the Volunteer Army, under the direct leadership of the Party, successfully completed combat, training, and various work and study tasks, and demonstrated courageous and tenacious spirit and a high degree of revolutionary heroism in completing these tasks, fully utilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the youth.
    The instructions then pointed out: In the future, Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over youth work. Party committees should regularly include youth work on the agenda of political work, specifically arrange youth work while deploying central tasks, and promptly inspect and summarize it. They should strengthen the construction of youth work departments and Youth League branches. At the same time, Party committees at all levels must be good at carrying out work by grasping the characteristics of youth, implement Chairman Mao's instructions of "good health, good study, and good work," and organize youth to actively study the country's general task during the transition period, so that they can play the greatest role in the great cause of defending the construction of the motherland and defending world peace.
