Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 19th: The spokesman for the People's Republic of China delegation attending the Geneva Conference issued the following written statement on May 19th:

On May 17, 1954, the United States delegation in Geneva released a letter from the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) in Korea to the Korean Military Armistice Commission, dated May 7th of the same year. According to news reports, the United States emphasized that the Korean NNSC is no longer capable of carrying out the tasks assigned to it by the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The spokesman for the People's Republic of China delegation believes that this assertion is inconsistent with the facts. It has been almost ten months since the Korean armistice. During these ten months, the NNSC has played a significant role in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. In the rear ports of both North and South Korea, as well as other areas outside the demilitarized zone, the NNSC has carried out its supervisory duties in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement. The contribution and achievements of the NNSC in assisting the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement cannot be denied.

Admittedly, the NNSC has not been without difficulties in its work. However, these difficulties have arisen because the United Nations Command has repeatedly failed to comply with the Korean Armistice Agreement. As the whole world knows, the United Nations Command forcibly detained more than 21,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides after the armistice, and has continuously introduced reinforcing combat materials and equipment for Syngman Rhee's troops from outside Korea. This inevitably caused great difficulties for the NNSC. In their reports to the Korean Military Armistice Commission on April 15th and April 30th of this year, the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC cited facts to prove that it was precisely the United Nations Command that restricted and obstructed the activities of the NNSC inspection teams in South Korea. In order to escort the forcibly detained Chinese prisoners of war to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, they even prevented the NNSC inspection team from performing its regular tasks in Incheon port. Since the armistice, according to the materials already found in the aforementioned reports, the United Nations Command has brought in a large number of combat aircraft and artillery from outside Korea. This cannot be denied.

The Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission has repeatedly made detailed replies to the arguments raised in the letter from the Swedish and Swiss members of the NNSC to the Military Armistice Commission on May 7th of this year.

The spokesman believes that at a time when the Geneva Conference is seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean and Indochina issues, spreading the argument that the Korean NNSC is no longer capable of performing its tasks is clearly aimed at undermining the role of the Korean NNSC and attempting to obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference.

Attachment 1: "Report on the United Nations Command's Obstruction and Restriction of the Activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams" by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Korean NNSC on April 15, 1954.

Attachment 2: "Report on Military Reinforcements Introduced into Korea by the United Nations Command in Violation of the Armistice Agreement During the Period from July 27, 1953, to April 15, 1954" by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Korean NNSC on April 30, 1954.

### 我国代表团在日内瓦发表声明  揭穿美国企图抹煞中立国监察委员会作用的恶毒用意

    我国代表团在日内瓦发表声明
    揭穿美国企图抹煞中立国监察委员会作用的恶毒用意
    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人五月十九日发表书面声明如下：
    一九五四年五月十七日美国代表团在日内瓦发表朝鲜中立国监察委员会瑞典、瑞士委员在同年五月七日致朝鲜军事停战委员会的一封函件。根据新闻报道，美国强调朝鲜中立国监察委员会已无力执行朝鲜停战协定所赋予它的任务。
    中华人民共和国代表团发言人认为这种断言是不符合事实的。朝鲜停战以来已将近十个月。在这十个月的期间，中立国监察委员会对于协助朝鲜停战协定的实施起了不少的作用。在南北朝鲜的各后方口岸以及非军事区以外的其他地区，中立国监察委员会按照停战协定的规定，进行了监察的职务。对于协助朝鲜停战协定的实施，中立国监察委员会的贡献和成绩是不容抹煞的。
    诚然，中立国监察委员会在其工作中不是没有困难的。但这种困难是由于联合国军屡次不遵守朝鲜停战协定而产生的。举世皆知，联合国军在停战后强迫扣留了朝中被俘人员二万一千余名，又不断从朝鲜境外进入了增援性的作战物资装备李承晚的军队。这就不可避免地为中立国监察委员会造成极大的困难。中立国监察委员会波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员在今年四月十五日和四月三十日给朝鲜军事停战委员会的报告中列举事实证明，正是联合国军限制和阻挠中立国视察小组在南朝鲜的活动。他们为了把强迫扣留下的中国战俘押送给蒋介石反动集团，甚至不让中立国视察小组在仁川港口执行它的经常任务。停战以来，根据上述报告中已经查出的材料，联合国军从朝鲜境外进入了大批的作战飞机和大炮。这是不能否认的。
    对于中立国监察委员会瑞典、瑞士委员今年五月七日致军事停战委员会的函件中所提出的论点，军事停战委员会朝中方面在过去已多次作了详尽的答复。
    发言人认为，正当日内瓦会议寻求朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的和平解决的时候，散布朝鲜中立国监察委员会已无力执行它的任务的论调，它的目的显然在于破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会的作用，并企图阻挠日内瓦会议的进展。
      附件一，一九五四年四月十五日朝鲜中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员“关于联合国军方面阻挠和限制中立国视察小组活动的报告”。
      附件二，一九五四年四月三十日朝鲜中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员“关于联合国军方面在一九五三年七月二十七日至一九五四年四月十五日期间违反停战协定以军事增援运入朝鲜的报告”。
        （编者按：以上两个附件已经分别刊载在一九五四年四月二十二日和一九五四年五月六日本报四版）
