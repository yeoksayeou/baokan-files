Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th dispatch from TASS: In recent days, British newspapers have continued to comment on Churchill's recent speech at the annual meeting of the Conservative Party organization, the "Primrose League." Churchill's remarks on British-Soviet relations have attracted the attention of newspapers from all factions. He said: "We should establish such a connection with Russia that, despite all the troubles, dangers and contradictions, it will allow the Russian people and the Soviet government to believe that we hope they live in peace, happiness, and growing prosperity in their powerful country; we hope that they will play a proud and outstanding role in leading mankind."

It was precisely this part of Churchill's speech that aroused the most enthusiastic response. Many people believe that this passage reflects the sentiments of the broad sections of British society, who are all worried about the current international tension and eager for the international tension to ease.

In Britain, the movement calling for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons is expanding daily. People are increasingly dissatisfied with the policy of reviving West German militarism, especially with the aggressive bloc across the Atlantic attempting to force Britain to participate in the establishment of a new aggressive bloc against the people of Asian countries. The "Scotsman" wrote with satisfaction when commenting on Churchill's speech: "This is indeed not an American-style attitude."

The "Yorkshire Post" editorial on May 1st wrote: The policy formulated by Churchill is ultimately "the only possible policy towards Russia."

The "Daily Express" commented on Churchill's speech: "This speech proves the Prime Minister's determination to work hard to improve relations between East and West. The new posture he made towards Moscow on the eve of May Day came with his firm refusal to accept the United States' views on Indochina." The London press also pointed out that before delivering his speech at the annual meeting of the "Primrose League," Churchill spoke at the annual banquet of the Royal Academy of Arts, expressing his concerns about the threat of atomic war. He hoped that this greatest discovery in science would not be used to harm mankind, and hoped that due to this growing danger, "war would be declared illegal." Obviously, Churchill's words reflected a widely held view in Britain and other European countries: the atomic bombs that people across the Atlantic use to make threats will, in the event of a conflict, be dropped on these countries first.

It is believed here that the wishes of the British head of government will help improve the international situation.

    英国报纸重视邱吉尔关于英苏关系的演说
    认为英国政府首脑的愿望会有助于国际局势的好转
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社伦敦八日讯：最近几天英国报纸继续评论邱吉尔最近在保守党组织“普林罗斯同盟”的年会上发表的演说。邱吉尔演说中关于英苏关系的一段话引起各派报纸的重视。他说：“我们应该同俄国建立这样一种联系，尽管存在种种烦恼、危险和矛盾，它将可以使俄国人民和苏联政府相信：我们希望他们在他们的强大的国家里安宁、幸福、日益昌盛，过着越来越美好的生活；我们希望他们在领导人类中起可以自豪的出色的作用。”
    引起最热烈反应的正是邱吉尔演说的这一部分。许多人认为这一段话反映了英国广大各界人士的情绪，他们都为现存的国际紧张局势担忧，渴望国际紧张局势缓和。
    在英国，要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的运动日见扩大，大家越来越不满意复活西德军国主义的政策，尤其不满意大西洋彼岸的侵略集团企图强迫英国参与建立一个反对亚洲各国人民的新侵略集团。“苏格兰人报”评邱吉尔演说时满意地写道：“这的确不是美国式的态度了。”
      “约克郡邮报”五月一日的社论写道：邱吉尔制订的政策终究是“对待俄国的唯一可能的政策”。
      “每日快报”评论邱吉尔的演说时写道：“这个发言证明了首相决心努力改善东西方之间的关系。他在五一的前夕向莫斯科所作的新姿态，是随着他坚决拒绝接受美国对印度支那的观点而来的。”伦敦的新闻界还指出：邱吉尔在“普林罗斯同盟”的年会上发表演说以前，曾在皇家艺术学院的每年宴会上发言，对原子战争的威胁表示担心。他希望这个科学上最大的发现不用于危害人类，并希望由于这种日益增长的危险而“宣布战争为非法”。显然，邱吉尔的话反映了英国和其他欧洲国家广泛流行的看法：大西洋彼岸的人们用来进行威胁的原子弹，一旦发生冲突，将首先投在这些国家。
    此间认为，英国政府首脑的愿望会有助于国际局势的好转。
