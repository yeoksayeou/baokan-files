    The Tibetan People and the Tibetan People Embark on a Bright and Happy Road
    Zhang Jingwu
      On May 23, 1951, the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, bringing great epoch-making changes to the history of the Tibetan people and the history of the relationship between the Tibetan people and the motherland. Since then, the Tibetan people have been permanently free from imperialist aggression and bondage, returned to the big family of the People's Republic of China, permanently eliminated the pain of national oppression, and, like other fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, fully enjoyed the rights of national equality. In the great revolutionary cause of jointly building the motherland's big family, in accordance with the spirit of the agreement, the political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of the Tibetan region and the Tibetan people are gradually developing, realizing the consolidation of the unification of the motherland and the unity among all fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland, and enabling the Tibetan people to embark on a bright and happy road.
    In the past three years, many significant achievements have been made in the implementation of the agreement.
    First, the relations between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups and within the Tibetan ethnic group have greatly improved and are continuing to improve. The historical ethnic estrangement is gradually being eliminated, and the unity between the Tibetan people and the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland, especially between the Tibetan and Han peoples, and within the Tibetan ethnic group, is flourishing. As the Tibetan local government successively sent responsible officials, responsible religious figures, business representatives, and youth representatives to form congratulatory delegations, visiting groups, and delegations to Beijing to pay respects to Chairman Mao, expressing their support and trust in the Central People's Government, they further learned about the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao's love and care for the Tibetan people. They visited various aspects of the construction of the great motherland and understood the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic and religious policies from their own practical experience. The central personnel and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, earnestly implemented the agreement and respected the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, and used their own practical model actions to make the Tibetan people more deeply aware of the correctness and greatness of the central ethnic equality and unity policy and recognize that the Tibetan people's religious beliefs and customs were respected and protected. The Chinese Communist Party adheres to the policy of long-term unity, long-term cooperation, and service to the people for patriotic democratic figures and leaders of all ethnic groups and religions. Chairman Mao instructed: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, protecting believers and non-believers, believers of this religion or believers of other religions, respecting their beliefs. Today, we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future." These are all important maxims for our work in Tibet. With these maxims and the joint efforts of the Han and Tibetan peoples, we have achieved such achievements.
    Secondly, with the consolidation and strengthening of national unity, the relationship and trust between the central government and the Tibetan local government have been enhanced. This situation is prominently reflected in foreign affairs. For example, the former Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Tibetan Local Government was merged into the Foreign Affairs Assistant Office of the Central People's Government Representative in 1953, specifically implementing Article 14 of the agreement, "The Central People's Government shall handle all foreign affairs of the Tibetan region in a unified manner and, on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, live in peace with neighboring countries and establish and develop fair trade relations," which further realized the unification of the motherland's foreign affairs. In accordance with the basic spirit of this provision and the central government's peaceful foreign policy, on April 29, 1954, the delegation of our Central People's government and the delegation of the Indian government signed in Beijing the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Transportation between the Tibetan Region of China and India." This agreement was signed on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The privileges arising from the unequal treaties left over from the imperialist aggression against Tibet no longer exist since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. After the signing of this agreement, the relationship between the new Chinese government and the Indian government in the Tibetan region of China and India was re-established through consultation on a new basis. This agreement is the initial achievement of the new relationship between China and India in the Tibetan region. It not only conforms to the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples but also fully conforms to the interests of the motherland and the Tibetan people. This is a major victory for the motherland's peaceful foreign policy, and it is another major achievement in implementing the agreement to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of the Tibetan and Han peoples.
    Thirdly, in the development of Tibet's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, many important achievements have also been made in the past three years. The Tibetan local government organized reform meetings, adopted some good measures to reduce debt and reduce the "Ula" system, and continued to study various reform matters. Responsible monks and secular officials in various regions of Tibet established learning organizations to study the agreement and various central policies, and to study important domestic and international current events. This kind of political progress requirement is an indispensable important factor for Tibet's greater development in the future. Various regions of Tibet have also successively established patriotic friendship associations for youth and women, organizing learning, learning various kinds of knowledge under the banner of anti-imperialist patriotism, unity, and progress. Patriotic concepts and political awareness are increasingly enhanced and progressing. This is an indispensable backbone force for Tibet's greater development in the future.
    In the past three years, central personnel and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have established banks and trading companies in various parts of Tibet. Banks have issued interest-free agricultural loans, low-interest loans for handicrafts and commerce, and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet has reclaimed land for production, helped the Tibetan people build water conservancy projects, set up agricultural and pastoral experiment stations, and used more advanced agricultural tools and farming methods to improve production technology and increase yields, and tested various fine varieties of crops. The above measures have played a certain important role in stabilizing the financial prices in Tibet, developing domestic and foreign trade, supporting the development of Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts, and meeting the needs of the people. In particular, the Kangzang Highway, which is being actively built, has more significant meaning for the gradual development of Tibet's political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings in the future. The Central People's Government helped the Tibetan people establish their own primary schools in Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and other regions, giving thousands of Tibetan children the opportunity to study, and selected many Tibetan youths to study in Beijing and Chengdu, making a good start for developing Tibet's language and writing and educational undertakings, and cultivating ethnic cadres and educating young children to build a new Tibet. People's hospitals and clinics established in Lhasa, Shigatse, and other places in the past three years have provided free treatment and sent medical teams to various places for mobile treatment, allowing the vast number of Tibetan people to be free from the pain of illness. The health of the people has been guaranteed to a certain extent. In 1953 alone, the people's hospitals and clinics in various places provided free treatment to 251,000 Tibetan people. The construction of serum factories and the veterinary disease prevention and control organizations have brought good news of happiness to the health of the Tibetan people's livestock. In short, these preliminary achievements in the above-mentioned work will play a major positive role in further developing Tibet's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, gradually improving the people's lives, and building a new Tibet in the future.
    The attainment of these major achievements is due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the correct implementation of the policy of national equality and mutual assistance in the Tibetan region by applying the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on national issues, and the implementation of the policy of unity, progress, and greater development. It is due to the unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples, the close unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the increasing strengthening and consolidation of unity within the Tibetan people. It is due to the improvement of the political awareness of the Tibetan ethnic leaders and the broad masses of the people, the growth of patriotism, and the faithful implementation of the agreement, active work, and friendly assistance and support of the People's Liberation Army and Han personnel entering Tibet, and the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland.
    However, the above-mentioned achievements are only the beginning of our glorious and arduous cause of building a new Tibet and consolidating the national defense of the motherland. We still need to do more work and make greater efforts in the future.
    We must recognize that from the day the People's Republic of China was founded, our motherland began to enter a new period of gradually transitioning to a bright and happy socialist society. During this transition period, our general task in ethnic work is to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups and jointly build the motherland's big family; within the unified motherland's big family, ensure equality in all aspects of rights for all ethnic groups and implement ethnic regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups, gradually eliminate the de facto inequalities between ethnic groups left over from history, enable backward ethnic groups to join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and gradually transition to socialist society. This general task is in line with the interests and development of the Tibetan people, and it is the beacon for the Tibetan people to embark on a bright and happy road.
    In accordance with the general task of our motherland's new period of transition to socialism in terms of national issues, our specific work in the Tibetan region in the future is to resolutely implement the central government's various policies, gradually and thoroughly implement the seventeen-article agreement in accordance with the specific political and economic conditions in the Tibetan region, and in accordance with the wishes of the patriotic figures and people of Tibet, implement a cautious and steady policy, and on the basis of consolidating the unification of the motherland and national unity, we must also overcome the ideological remnants of great Han chauvinism, prevent the development of local nationalism tendencies among the Tibetan people, continue to consolidate and strengthen national unity, consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist patriotic forces, further carry out propaganda and education work, improve the political awareness of the broad masses of the people, and vigorously cultivate Tibetan ethnic cadres through various practical work and learning and training methods. In accordance with the spirit of the agreement, we will advance the work in the Tibetan region to the stage of implementing ethnic regional autonomy, realize the right of the Tibetan people to be masters of their own affairs, gradually develop the political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of the Tibetan people, and gradually improve the people's material and cultural lives. Under the glorious illumination of the general task of the country's transition period, we will actively work and steadily move forward to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet!
    In order to ensure the completion of the arduous and glorious tasks we are undertaking, we must continue to promote the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation, vigorously overcome obstacles on the road ahead, and earnestly correct shortcomings and mistakes in our work. In particular, we must raise our political vigilance, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, expose all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and reactionaries at any time, prevent any destructive activities of imperialism and reactionaries, and further strengthen the education combining patriotism and internationalism. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, on the basis of the close unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, we will further unite the Tibetan people, and with the friendly assistance of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the Han people, and the unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation of the central personnel and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, we will surely be able to gradually realize the policy of unity, progress, and greater development. In the great cause of building the motherland, building a new Tibet, and consolidating the national defense of the motherland, we will surely achieve greater achievements, thereby steadily guiding the Tibetan people onto a bright and happy road.
    Long live the great family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups - the People's Republic of China! Long live the great unity of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland! Long live the liberation of the Tibetan people! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland!

    西藏民族和西藏人民走上光明和幸福的道路
    张经武
      一九五一年五月二十三日，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，给予西藏民族的历史以及西藏民族与祖国关系的历史，带来了伟大的划时代的变化。从此以后，西藏民族和西藏人民永远脱离了帝国主义的侵略和羁绊，回到了中华人民共和国祖国大家庭，永远解除了民族压迫的痛苦，与祖国其他兄弟民族一样，充分享受民族平等权利，在共同建设祖国大家庭的伟大革命事业中，根据协议的精神，正逐步地发展着西藏地区和西藏民族的政治、经济和文化教育事业，实现了巩固祖国的统一和祖国各兄弟民族间的团结，使西藏民族和西藏人民走上光明幸福的道路。
    三年中，在执行协议方面取得了许多重大的成就。
    首先是汉藏民族间和西藏民族内部的关系得到了很大的改善，而且还在不断改善着。历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂正在日益消除中，西藏民族和祖国各兄弟民族，尤其是藏汉民族之间，以及西藏民族内部的团结，正在蓬勃发展着。由于西藏地方政府前后派遣负责官员、宗教界负责人士、商业代表、青年代表等组织了致敬团、参观团、代表团去北京向毛主席致敬，表示了对中央人民政府的拥护和信任，进一步了解到中央人民政府毛主席对于西藏民族的爱护和关怀，参观了伟大祖国各方面的建设，从亲身的实际体验中了解了中国共产党的民族政策与宗教政策。进藏中央工作人员和人民解放军执行了毛主席的指示，认真地执行协议与尊重西藏民族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，以自己的实际模范行动，使西藏民族和西藏人民更深刻地认识到中央民族平等团结政策的正确和伟大，认识到西藏民族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯受到了尊重与保护。中国共产党对于各民族各教派中爱国民主人士及领袖人物坚持长期团结，长期合作并为人民群众服务的方针，毛主席所指示的：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”这都是我们在西藏工作的重要箴规。有了这些箴规，有了汉、藏民族人民的共同努力，我们才获得了这样的成就。
    其次，随着民族团结的巩固和加强，增强了中央与西藏地方的关系和信任。这种情况突出地表现在外事方面。如过去的西藏地方政府外事局于一九五三年合并于中央人民政府代表外事帮办办公室，具体实现了协议第十四条“中央人民政府统一处理西藏地区的一切涉外事宜，并在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的基础上，与邻邦和平相处，建立和发展公平的通商贸易关系”的规定，就进一步实现了祖国的外事统一。根据这一规定的基本精神和中央和平外交政策，复于一九五四年四月二十九日我中央人民政府代表团与印度政府代表团在北京签订了“中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定”，这个协定是在互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互惠，和平共处的原则基础上签订的，过去帝国主义侵略西藏过程中所遗留下来的不平等条约而产生的特权，自中华人民共和国成立已不再存在了。这一协定签订后，新中国政府与印度政府在中国西藏地方与印度之间的关系，在新的基础上通过协商重新建立起来。这个协定就是中印两国在西藏地方的新关系的初步成就。它不仅符合于中印两国人民的传统友谊，而且是完全符合于祖国和西藏民族的利益的，这是祖国和平外交政策的一大胜利，这是执行协议巩固祖国的统一和藏汉民族团结又一项重大的成就。
    再次，在发展西藏的政治、经济、文化事业方面，三年来同样取得了许多重要成就，西藏地方政府组织了改革会议，关于减轻债务与减轻“乌拉”制度，采取了一些好的措施，并继续研究各项改革事宜，西藏各地区的负责僧俗官员成立了学习组织，学习协议和中央各种政策，学习国内外的重要时事，这种政治上的进步要求，是将来西藏更加发展不可缺少的重要因素。西藏各地区并相继成立了青年、妇女爱国联谊会，组织学习，在反帝爱国团结进步的旗帜下学习各种知识，爱国观念和政治觉悟正在日益增强与进步着，这是西藏将来更加发展不可缺少的骨干力量。
    三年来进藏中央工作人员和人民解放军在西藏各地设立银行与贸易公司，银行放发农业无利贷款，手工业商业低利贷款，以及进藏人民解放军开荒生产，帮助藏族人民兴修水利，开办农牧试验场，采用比较进步的农具及耕作方法改进生产技术提高产量，试种各种优良品种的作物等。上述措施对于稳定西藏地区的金融物价，发展对内对外贸易，扶植西藏农、牧、手工业的发展，解决人民的需要，均起了一定的重要作用。特别是正在积极修筑的康藏公路对于今后逐步发展西藏的政治、经济、文化教育事业上更有重大的意义。中央人民政府帮助藏族人民在拉萨，日喀则、江孜等地区创设西藏民族自己的小学校，使千多个藏族儿童得到求学的机会，并选送许多藏族青年去北京和成都学习，为发展西藏的言语文字和教育事业，培养建设新西藏的民族干部和教育青年儿童，作了良好开端。三年来在拉萨、日喀则等地设立的人民医院以及门诊所，进行免费治疗并派医疗队到各地巡回治疗，使广大藏族人民得以免除疾病的痛苦。人民体质的健康，有了一定的保证。只一九五三年经各地人民医院及门诊所免费治疗疾病的藏族人民有二十五万一千多人次。正在建设的血清厂与兽疫防治工作组织给西藏人民的牲畜健康带来了幸福的喜讯。总之，以上这些工作上的初步成就，对于今后进一步发展西藏的政治、经济和文化事业，逐步改善人民生活，建设新西藏，将起着重大的积极作用。
    以上这些重大成就的取得，是由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导，运用马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的基本原则，在西藏地区正确地实行了民族平等，团结互助政策，贯彻了团结、进步，更加发展的方针。是由于汉藏两个民族的团结，达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼的亲密团结以及西藏民族内部的团结日益加强和巩固。是由于西藏民族领袖人士与广大人民政治觉悟的提高，爱国主义的增长以及进藏人民解放军与汉族工作人员忠实地执行协议，积极工作，和祖国各兄弟民族人民友谊帮助与支援的结果。
    但是上述这些成就仅只是我们建设新西藏和巩固祖国国防这一光荣而艰巨的事业的开端，我们今后还须做更多的工作和作更大的努力。
    我们必须认识，从中华人民共和国成立的一天起，我们的祖国就开始进入了逐步地向光明幸福的社会主义社会过渡的新时期，在这个过渡时期中，我们在民族工作方面的总任务是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利方面的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。这一总任务是符合于西藏民族和西藏人民的利益与发展情况的，也就是西藏民族和西藏人民走向光明幸福的道路的灯塔。
    依照我们祖国向社会主义过渡新时期在民族问题方面的总任务，今后我们在西藏地区的各项具体工作，就是要坚决执行中央的各项政策，依据西藏地区政治、经济各方面的具体情况，根据西藏领袖爱国人士和人民的志愿，逐步彻底实现十七条协议，执行慎重稳进的方针，在巩固祖国的统一和民族团结基础上，我们还须克服大汉族主义的思想残余，防止西藏民族中的地方民族主义倾向的发展，继续巩固和加强民族团结，巩固和扩大反帝爱国的力量，进一步开展宣传教育工作，提高广大人民的政治觉悟，通过各项实际工作及学习训练等方式，大力培养西藏民族干部，根据协议的精神，把西藏地区的工作，推进到实行民族区域自治的阶段，实现西藏民族当家作主的权利，逐步地发展西藏民族的政治、经济和文化教育事业，逐步地改善人民物质生活和文化生活，在国家过渡时期总任务的光辉照耀下，为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏，积极工作，稳步前进！
    为了保证完成我们所担负的艰巨而光荣的任务，我们还须继续发扬团结互助友爱合作的精神，大力克服前进道路上的障碍，认真纠正工作中的缺点和错误，特别是必须提高政治警惕，划清敌我界限，随时揭露帝国主义和反动派的一切阴谋诡计，防止帝国主义和反动派的任何破坏活动，进一步加强爱国主义和国际主义相结合的教育，在中国共产党，中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密团结的基础上，进一步团结西藏民族和西藏人民，在祖国各兄弟民族人民特别是汉族人民的友谊帮助和进藏中央工作人员、人民解放军的团结互助友爱合作下，我们一定能够逐步实现团结进步，更加发展的方针；在建设祖国、建设新西藏、巩固祖国国防的伟大事业中，一定取得更大的成就，从而稳步地引导西藏民族和西藏人民走上光明幸福的道路。
    各民族友爱合作的大家庭——中华人民共和国万岁！祖国各兄弟民族大团结万岁！西藏民族和西藏人民解放万岁！中国共产党万岁！祖国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（新华社）
