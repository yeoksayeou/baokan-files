    Shanghai Turbine Factory Conducts Major Product Quality Inspection

    The state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory, accepting user feedback and combining it with labor competitions, conducted a major product quality inspection and formulated measures to improve product quality.

    Since the fourth quarter of last year, the Shanghai Turbine Factory has carried out labor competitions and initially implemented work plans and promoted advanced Soviet operational experience, resulting in significant changes in production. However, some of the products manufactured by the factory still have many quality problems. For example, at the end of last year, a batch of diesel engines sold by the factory to the Central South Nonferrous Metals Bureau had a major accident when the first unit was installed and the "cylinder liner" broke during the test run. All the springs on more than a dozen "valves" on the diesel engine were also broken, and there were serious problems such as steam leakage and oil mixing with gasoline during refueling.

    In response to the above situation, under the leadership of the factory's Party Committee, a product quality inspection team was formed in mid-April, consisting of the factory director, relevant department heads, administrative management and technical cadres from relevant workshops, and technical personnel invited from the user, the Central South Nonferrous Metals Bureau. The team went deep into various departments, workshops, and work sections to conduct a comprehensive inspection from drawing design, raw material allocation, parts processing to finished product assembly and testing.

    Based on the analysis of the facts found during the inspection, the inspection team believes that the factory's product quality is not high and there are many problems. The reasons for this are inseparable from the complacency of the factory's leaders and their pursuit of quantity while neglecting quality improvement. Since the first diesel engine was produced, the factory developed a sense of complacency, thinking that "what could not be done in the past can now be done." Subsequent products were only subjected to general machine operation tests before being hastily shipped out of the factory. In addition, some technical personnel have a phenomenon of discussing theories divorced from reality. Until this inspection, it was found that all the necessary technical documents, whether in terms of technology or manufacturing, had no clear written regulations. Before manufacturing, some technical personnel modified the original drawings. After the modification, they did not conduct tests to prove whether the changes were correct before putting them into production. During this inspection, it was found that many problems occurred in the places where the drawings were modified.

    In addition, there is a lack of a clear quality inspection system in production, and some inspection personnel do not strictly implement the inspection system. For example, in the factory's processing workshop, "rejected work" amounted to more than 1,000 hours in March alone. In late April, a worker made a mistake in the drawing when machining a "cylinder liner," and continuously machined fifty-four cylinder liners incorrectly. The inspectors also failed to notice this, resulting in the scrapping of all the cylinder liners that could have been used to assemble nine diesel engines. After some diesel engines were assembled, there was still mud, sand, iron filings, and other dirty things inside the engine body that had not been cleaned out. In one case, after a diesel engine was tested, it was discovered that the iron slag splashed on the crankshaft by the worker while welding the engine body had not been scraped off, and the bearing was scratched with grooves more than two centimeters deep during operation.

    Through this inspection, the factory's Party Committee has identified improving quality as one of the most important political tasks at present. It has also formulated an education plan to conduct quality education for all employees in conjunction with labor competitions. Administratively, it is studying how to improve technical management, strengthen inspection work, and has formulated preliminary process regulations, requiring production to be carried out in accordance with the process regulations. It is also taking out a diesel engine for long-term testing in order to identify problems and improve them in a timely manner; for diesel engines that have already been sold and installed and have been found to have quality problems, all will be recalled. Those that have not yet been installed will have special personnel assigned to assist users in inspection.

    The factory's conscientious and responsible inspection and active research to improve products not only provides a guarantee for the factory to improve quality in the future, but also satisfies users. (Wu Yubing)

### 上海汽轮机厂进行产品质量大检查

    上海汽轮机厂进行产品质量大检查
    国营上海汽轮机厂，接受用户意见，结合劳动竞赛，进行产品质量大检查，拟订了提高产品质量措施。
    上海汽轮机厂，从去年第四季度起，开展了劳动竞赛，初步贯彻了作业计划、推广了苏联先进操作经验以后，生产上有了显著变化。但该厂所制造的部分产品，在质量上还存在很多问题。如去年年底，该厂出售给中南有色金属管理局的一批柴油机，按装好第一部，在试车时就发生重要机件“汽缸套”折断事故。在柴油机上十几只“凡而”上的弹簧也全部断掉，并有严重的漏汽和加油时机油和汽油混合进油等不良现象。
    针对上述情形，在该厂党委会领导下，在四月中旬由厂长，各有关职能科长，各有关车间行政管理与技术干部，并邀请用户——中南有色金属管理局技术人员参加，组成产品质量检查组，深入各科室、车间、工段，从图样设计、原材料配用、零件加工到成品装配试验，进行了全面检查。
    根据检查出的事实分析，检查组认为，该厂产品质量不高，并存在许多问题，其原因：与该厂领导人员的自满情绪及追求数量忽视质量的提高分不开的。该厂自第一部柴油机出厂时，滋长了“过去不能做，现在能做了”的自满情绪，以后继续生产的产品仅只做了一般机器运转的试验，即匆匆送出厂去，另外，部分技术人员存在着脱离实际空谈理论的现象，直到这次检查为止，发现一切应该具备的技术文件，无论在技术上制造上，都没有书面的明确规定。在制造以前，部分技术人员，修改了原有图样，修改后没经过试验证明改的是否正确，就投入了生产。在这次检查中发现，图样被改动的地方很多处都发生了问题。
    此外在生产中缺乏明确的质量检查制度，部分担任检验工作人员执行检验制度不严。如该厂加工车间，在三月份一个月的“工废”就有一千多小时，四月下旬有个工人车“汽缸套”时，看错了图样，连续车错了五十四个汽缸套。检验人员也未发现，以致使能供装配九部柴油机的汽缸套，全部报废。有的柴油机装好以后，在机身内部尚存在有泥沙铁屑等污浊东西没被清除。甚至有一部柴油机试车后，发现工人在电焊机身时撒在弯地轴上的铁汁，没有刮掉，运转时把轴承划成两公分多深的口子。
    通过这次检查，该厂党委会已把提高质量问题，确定为当前重要政治任务之一。并拟定了结合劳动竞赛向全体职工进行质量教育的教育计划。行政上正研究健全技术管理，加强检验工作，并已制订出初步工艺规程，要求按工艺规程生产。并抽出一部柴油机进行长期试车，以便从中发现问题，及时改进；对已售出的柴油机，凡是已安装使用并发现质量有问题的，全部收回，尚未安装使用的，则派专人协助用户进行检查。
    该厂这次认真负责的检查和积极研究改进产品，不仅是对该厂今后提高质量有了保证，也使用户感到满意。　　　　（吴于冰）
