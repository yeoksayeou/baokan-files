Another Provocative Act by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek Gang in Intercepting a Polish Merchant Ship

On May 13th, after reconnaissance and cover by American aircraft, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang warships in Taiwan brazenly launched an armed attack on the Polish merchant ship "Gottwald" in international waters, and hijacked the ship, its crew, and cargo. This is another serious provocative incident by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek gang following the interception of the Polish merchant ship "Praca" on October 4, 1953.

On May 15th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Poland lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government regarding this incident, demanding that the U.S. government issue necessary instructions to immediately release the hijacked Polish ship, personnel, and cargo, and punish the perpetrators. The Polish government reserves the right to demand compensation for losses. The Chinese people firmly support the legitimate position taken by the Polish government on this incident and resolutely oppose the piratical actions of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek gang in intercepting Polish merchant ships.

Any country in the world recognizes that ships of all countries have complete freedom to navigate on the high seas, and this right must not be violated in any way. The act of the United States instructing the Chiang Kai-shek gang to intercept Polish merchant ships time and again shows that the U.S. ruling clique, which is accustomed to acting arbitrarily, completely disregards the universally recognized norms of international law, and that the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang it supports has long become a group of lawless pirates.

The United States' attempt to evade its responsibility for this illegal incident is futile. Everyone knows that the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang in Taiwan is nothing more than a political corpse, and the U.S. ruling clique is stepping up its use of it to promote a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and maintain a tense situation. The United States has illegally occupied our territory of Taiwan and has turned Taiwan into a base for U.S. aggression in the Far East. Therefore, the United States cannot deny its direct responsibility for the evil deeds of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. In fact, U.S. armed forces directly participated in the attack operations when the Chiang Kai-shek gang intercepted Polish merchant ships on both occasions, which shows that the United States' use of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek gang to intercept merchant ships is a planned action with despicable motives.

Today, the Geneva Conference is underway, and people all over the world are eager to further ease the tense situation in Asia and the world and improve economic and cultural relations between countries. Under these circumstances, the United States instructs the Chiang Kai-shek gang to repeatedly intercept Polish merchant ships and engage in provocations, obviously in an attempt to deepen the tense situation in the Far East and to maintain its bankrupt U.S. "embargo" policy through such barbaric means. In fact, the United States has instructed the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek gang not only to intercept Polish merchant ships, but also to intercept merchant ships of other countries to intimidate merchant ships of various countries from trading with our country. Therefore, this approach by the United States crudely threatens the safety of navigation in the Far East, threatens trade between countries around the world and the Asian continent, and thus harms the shipping and trade interests of many countries.

During the Geneva Conference, many countries are deeply concerned about improving and expanding trade relations with China. Lei Renmin, advisor to the Chinese delegation to the Geneva Conference, gave a speech to journalists from many countries on May 15, introducing China's economic construction and foreign trade policies, and pointed out: "A large number of manufacturers and entrepreneurs in capitalist countries have realized that 'embargo' and economic discrimination against China will only increase their own economic difficulties, so they generally demand trade with China."
  "If there are no artificial obstacles, trade between Western European countries and China will undoubtedly have further development." There is no doubt that the call for expanding normal international trade is growing stronger day by day. The United States continues to force others to abide by its self-serving embargo, encountering increasing setbacks. It is precisely for this reason that the United States is increasingly trying to threaten countries that demand the expansion of normal international trade by any means necessary.

Therefore, the interception of Polish merchant ships by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek gang at the instigation of the United States cannot be regarded as an isolated incident. All countries and people who hope to ease the tense situation in Asia and the world and hope to improve trade relations between countries must stand up to condemn the United States' actions that seriously violate the norms of international law, demand that the U.S. government order Taiwan to immediately release the Polish merchant ships, personnel, and materials it has intercepted, and guarantee that similar incidents do not occur, in order to ensure the safety of international navigation in the Far East.

### 美、蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船的又一挑衅行为

    美、蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船的又一挑衅行为
    五月十三日，在美国飞机预先侦察以后和掩护之下，台湾蒋介石残余匪帮军舰，竟于公海地区对波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德”号实行武装袭击，并把该船和船上人员及货物劫走。这是美国和蒋匪帮继一九五三年十月四日截扣波兰商船“布拉卡”号之后的又一次严重的挑衅事件。
    五月十五日，波兰人民共和国外交部已就这一事件向美国政府提出了强硬的抗议，并要求美国政府作必要指示立即释放被劫走的波兰船只、人员和货物，并惩办犯罪者。波兰政府保留要求赔偿损失的权利。中国人民坚决支持波兰政府对这一事件所采取的正当立场，而坚决反对美国和蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船的海盗行为。
    世界上任何一个国家都承认，各国的船只在公海上航行是完全自由的，这个权利是不容受到任何侵犯的。美国指使蒋匪帮一次再次地截扣波兰商船的行为，说明了惯于横行霸道的美国统治集团根本无视于世界公认的国际法准则，而它所豢养的蒋介石残余匪帮则早已完全变成一群无法无天的海盗了。
    美国企图逃避它对这一非法事件所应负的责任，这是枉然的。谁都知道，台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮不过是一具政治僵尸，美国统治集团正在加紧利用它来推行敌视中国人民、维持紧张局势的政策。美国非法侵占了我国领土台湾，并已把台湾变成美国在远东进行侵略活动的一个基地，因此美国是绝对无法抵赖它对蒋匪帮为非作恶所负的直接责任的。事实上，蒋匪帮两次截扣波兰商船，都有美国武装力量直接参加袭击行动，这说明美国利用台湾蒋匪帮来拦截商船，完全是一种怀着卑鄙目的的有计划的行动。
    今天，日内瓦会议正在进行，全世界人民都渴望进一步缓和亚洲及世界紧张局势，并改善各国之间的经济与文化关系。在这种情况下，美国指使蒋匪帮一再截扣波兰商船，进行挑衅，显然是企图加深远东的紧张局势，并企图借着这种横暴手段来维持它破了产的美国“禁运”政策。事实上，美国指使台湾蒋匪帮不仅截扣波兰商船，而且曾经截扣过其他国家的商船，来威吓各国的商船不得来我国进行贸易。因此美国的这种做法就粗暴地威胁了远东的航行安全，威胁了世界各国和亚洲大陆之间的贸易往来，从而损害了许多国家的航运利益和贸易利益。
    在日内瓦会议期间，许多国家都深切地关心着改善和扩展对中国的贸易关系的问题。我国出席日内瓦会议代表团顾问雷任民曾在五月十五日向许多国家的记者发表谈话，介绍了我国的经济建设情况及对外贸易政策，并指出：“资本主义国家的大批制造商和企业家已经认识到，‘禁运’和对中国的经济歧视只会增加他们自己的经济困难，因此他们普遍要求与中国进行贸易。”
  “要是没有人为的障碍，西欧国家和中国之间的贸易无疑会有进一步的发展。”毫无疑问，要求扩展国际间正常贸易的呼声正一天天壮大起来。美国继续逼迫别人遵守它的损人利己的禁运令，碰到了越来越大的挫折。正是因为这样，美国就越来越企图不择手段地来威胁要求扩展国际间正常贸易的国家。
    因此，不能把美国指使台湾蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船，看成一个孤立的事件。一切希望缓和亚洲及世界紧张局势，希望改善各国之间的贸易关系的国家和人民，必须起来谴责美国严重违犯国际法准则的行为，要求美国政府指令台湾立即释放它所截扣的波兰商船、人员和物资，并保证不发生类似事件，以保证远东国际航行的安全。
