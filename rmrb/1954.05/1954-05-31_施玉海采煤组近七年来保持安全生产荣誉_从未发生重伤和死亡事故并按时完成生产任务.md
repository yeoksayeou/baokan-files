Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 30th: Shi Yuhai Coal Mining Team of the Xi'an Mining Bureau, a national model for safe coal production, continues to advance while maintaining its honor. For nearly seven years, from June 1947 to the present, this team has never experienced any serious injuries or fatalities. In terms of production, it consistently meets or exceeds its monthly and quarterly production targets. Since June of last year, the team has expanded from over 40 members to over 160.

Coal mining is a mobile operation with complex tasks and significant geological changes. The mines under the Xi'an Mining Bureau in particular face challenges due to old tunnels, brittle coal, and high methane content. These objective conditions present many difficulties for the Shi Yuhai Coal Mining Team. Over the years, they have mastered these difficulties and characteristics, and have insisted on implementing safety production systems such as shift handover systems, inspection systems (inspecting methane, roofs, etc.), and call-out systems. At the same time, they have focused on the most common types of accidents in coal mining, such as methane explosions and roof collapses. Based on the experience and lessons learned in the past, they have developed operating procedures and implemented them conscientiously. The Shi Yuhai Coal Mining Team has also carried out labor competitions centered on safe production around the operation plan, and has implemented daily operation plans through production meetings. The production meeting before entering the pit each day focuses on explaining the production plan for the shift, mobilizing workers to discuss concrete measures, and ensuring that everyone has a clear task and specific methods. The production meeting after leaving the pit summarizes the completion of the shift's tasks and examines the realization of group competition conditions, identifies experiences and lessons, conducts criticism and self-criticism, grasps key points, and derives solutions to problems. As a result of implementing the above measures, the team exceeded its production plans for the entire year of last year and the first quarter of this year. Since April of this year, they have also formulated more than 30 operating procedures in conjunction with the mining area plan, striving to further achieve safe and balanced completion of the state plan.

Over the past few years, the Shi Yuhai Coal Mining Team has also made significant improvements in technology. In terms of coal mining methods, they have changed from the partial caving roof management method, which was heavy labor, inefficient, and costly, to the total caving method. The coal recovery rate has increased from more than 50% in the past to about 70%, and costs have been greatly reduced. At the end of last year, they also implemented a double-cycle and assembly line operation method, which improved work efficiency and coal production. The degree of mechanization in coal mining and transportation is also increasing day by day.

    施玉海采煤组近七年来保持安全生产荣誉
    从未发生重伤和死亡事故并按时完成生产任务
     【新华社沈阳三十日电】全国煤矿安全生产模范——西安矿务局施玉海采煤组一直保持着荣誉在继续前进中。从一九四七年六月到现在将近七年来，这个组从来没有发生过重伤和死亡事故。生产上能经常按月按季完成或超额完成生产任务。去年六月起，这个组已由四十多人扩大到一百六十多人。
    煤矿生产是流动性作业，工种复杂，地质变化很大，特别是西安矿务局所属煤矿，因为坑道古老、煤质酥脆，含瓦斯量又多，这些客观条件，给施玉海采煤组带来许多困难。几年来，他们掌握住这些困难和特点，坚持执行了交接班制、检查制
  （检查瓦斯、顶板等）、喊号制等安全生产制度。同时，抓住煤矿生产中最易发生的事故如瓦斯爆炸，顶板石头塌落等等，根据平时所积累下来的经验和教训，制订出操作规程加以贯彻。施玉海采煤组还围绕作业计划，开展了以安全生产为中心的劳动竞赛，通过生产会议来贯彻日作业计划。每天入坑前的生产会议，着重交代当班生产计划，发动工人讨论出具体措施，使人人任务明确，办法具体。工作完了升坑后的生产会议，是总结当班的完成任务情况和检查小组竞赛条件的实现情况，找出经验教训，开展批评和自我批评，抓住关键，得出解决问题的办法。由于实行以上措施，这个组超额完成了去年全年和今年第一季度的生产计划。今年四月份起他们又结合采区计划，制订出三十多条作业规程，争取进一步做到安全地均衡地完成国家计划。
    几年来，施玉海采煤组在技术上也有了很大的提高。采煤方法上已由笨重劳动、效率低、成本高的部分陷落顶板管理法改为全部陷落法。煤的回采率由过去的百分之五十多提高到百分之七十左右，成本大大降低。去年底，他们又实行了双循环和流水作业法，提高了工作效率和煤的产量。采煤、运输方面的机械化程度也日益提高。
