Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 1st. TASS reported from Delhi on the 1st: Indian public opinion and the entire people are closely watching the progress of the Geneva Conference. The Indian people demand a ceasefire in Indochina, the establishment of peace in Korea, recognition of the People's Republic of China, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Asian countries. The Indian people condemn the military alliances that the United States is plotting in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Far East.

    In Madurai, peace supporters unanimously passed a resolution saying: "We sincerely hope that the Geneva Conference will take the necessary steps to transform the Korean armistice into a lasting peace and stop the war in Indochina. We firmly advocate that India, which played a significant role in promoting the cessation of the Korean War, should be represented at this conference. We demand that this conference unanimously pass a resolution to restore the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations."

    A city-wide conference was held in Madras, passing a resolution calling on major powers to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference on the main issues on the agenda. The resolution stated: "The Madras City Conference protests against the United States' interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries in the form of military alliances and military 'aid'. We call on the Asian people to act in unison to resist those countries that seek to dominate them. The conference believes that the US-Pakistan military treaty, the US-Japan military agreement, and the planned Pacific Pact are actions that endanger peace in Asia and worsen the tense situation in the region."

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: The Indian people warmly welcome the ongoing Geneva Conference. On April 25th, millions of peace-loving people across India held "Asia Day" activities to express their ardent hope for the success of the Geneva Conference.

    Mass rallies were held throughout West Bengal province on "Asia Day." Under the call of the West Bengal Provincial Student Federation, students in Calcutta held a demonstration on the evening of April 24th. The male and female students from universities, specialized schools, and primary and secondary schools participating in the march shouted the slogan "Let the Geneva Conference succeed" and held a demonstration in front of the Calcutta United States Information Service.

    The "Asia Day" rally organized by the St. Clair Peace Committee passed a resolution emphasizing that the convening of the Geneva Conference is a victory for peace-loving people around the world. The resolution supports Prime Minister Nehru's proposal, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Indochina, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations.

    The Delhi State Committee of the Communist Party of India held a mass rally for "Asia Day" in the suburbs of Delhi. Comrade Yo. Sharma, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, welcomed Nehru's proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Indochina and demanded a ban on hydrogen bombs in his speech. He said that this "contributes to the cause of peace."

    Under the chairmanship of S. Na. Kosla, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, a conference of people's representatives was held in Patiala. The conference welcomed the convening of the Geneva Conference, hoped for the success of the conference, and demanded an immediate ceasefire in Indochina.

    A.K. Gopalan, leader of the Communist Party of India parliamentary group, spoke at a mass rally in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, calling on the people to support the forces fighting for peace.

    The Bombay Peace Committee and the Central Provinces Peace Committee both held "Asia Day" rallies and passed resolutions supporting Prime Minister Nehru's statement on the Indochina issue.

    In addition, the people of important cities in Bihar Province, Andhra Pradesh Province, Uttar Pradesh Province, Central India States, and East Punjab Province, as well as farmers in various provinces of South India, also held various rallies, strongly condemning the US aggressive conspiracy in Asia, and expressing their support for the Geneva Conference.

    Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Jakarta: The Geneva Conference has become the focus of attention for Indonesian newspapers.

    An editorial in "Abadi Daily" stated: "We hope that this conference can bring concrete results to help ease international tensions." The newspaper requested that participants in the Geneva Conference pay attention to listening to the voices of the Asian people, because without considering the will of the people, "it is impossible to solve major problems in Asia."

    "Harian Rakjat" pointed out that the Geneva Conference will have to overcome enormous difficulties, especially in resolving the sharp conflict in Indochina. As a result of direct US intervention, the scope of this conflict is growing. This situation hinders the smooth progress of the Geneva Conference.

    "People's Daily" said: "The Geneva Conference faces many difficulties. In order to overcome dangers and difficulties, the people of the world should support the Geneva Conference so that the conference can achieve effective results. At present, the Indonesian people should launch a broader struggle for peace."

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 1st. On April 30th, Indonesian Member of Parliament and Secretary of the Greater Indonesia Party, Soekich, told reporters from this agency: "The Geneva Conference will open a path to resolving the issues of Korea and Indochina." He said: "I very much agree with resolving the war in Indochina through peaceful negotiations. I support all attitudes that help to achieve peace. We also advocate that all people should be granted freedom. The colonial system must be overthrown, and the Vietnamese people should achieve their freedom and independence."

    Soekich expressed his approval of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's statement on resolving the Indochina issue.

    Another Member of Parliament, Chairman of the Indonesian People's League Party, Djapari, said in an interview with reporters from this agency that he considered the Geneva Conference very important. He expressed optimism about the prospect of achieving peace in Asia. He emphasized the importance of the unity of the Asian people, including the Chinese people, for the cause of peace. He said, "It is impossible to exclude the People's Republic of China from the Asian family and international affairs. China is a force for peace, a great country with a high culture, and it cannot be conquered." He said that calling China an aggressor is an American propaganda statement. He pointed out that the United States is the one interfering in other people's affairs everywhere. He said, "The so-called US aid to backward countries is only aimed at expanding US markets and consolidating its strategic position. The Pacific or Southeast Asian alliance proposed by the United States is undoubtedly not for the benefit of Asia, but for the benefit of the United States."

    Djapari said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is an example of the struggle against French aggression and American interference and for freedom. He said: "I believe that the Vietnamese people will win their freedom."

    He also said: "We demand Asia for Asians, not Asians fighting Asians. I believe that establishing good mutual relations between Asian countries will be beneficial to Asia and beneficial to world peace."

    Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Rangoon dispatch: The Burmese Defense of World Peace Committee held a press conference on April 26th to report on the Geneva Conference and the issue of easing international tensions. The press conference was presided over by Wu Ba Yin, Secretary-General of the Burmese Defense of World Peace Committee.

    Wu Ba Yin said that the five major powers have finally convened the Geneva Conference. Based on their desire for peace, the people of Burma warmly welcome and congratulate the Geneva Conference on its success. Wu Ba Yin pointed out that imperialism has always arbitrarily resolved Asian issues without the consent of Asian countries. Today is different from the past. At the Geneva Conference, representatives of the People's Republic of China are already attending and participating in discussions. Therefore, the successful convening of the Geneva Conference is a peaceful achievement for the people of the world and the people of Asia.

    When talking about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, Wu Ba Yin advocated the peaceful unification of Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

    When talking about restoring peace in Indochina, Wu Ba Yin demanded a ceasefire, the termination of US intervention in the Vietnam War, and peaceful consultations between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to resolve the Indochina issue.

    Wu Ba Yin also said that the Geneva Conference should also broadly discuss and resolve issues unfavorable to world peace, such as prohibiting the use of weapons of mass destruction, reducing armaments, and stopping the United States from creating Asian "military alliances" to undermine the peaceful life of the Asian people.

    Wu Ba Yin finally called on the Burmese people to be vigilant, to prevent warmongers from attempting to sabotage the Geneva Conference, and to continue to strive for peace with greater efforts.

    印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸各国人民
    希望日内瓦会议取得有效成果
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社德里一日讯：印度舆论和全体人民密切注视日内瓦会议的进展。印度人民要求在印度支那停火，在朝鲜建立和平，承认中华人民共和国，一切外国军队撤离亚洲国家。印度人民谴责美国正在中东、东南亚和远东策划的军事同盟。
    在马都拉城，和平拥护者一致通过一项决议说：“我们衷心希望日内瓦会议采取必要的步骤把朝鲜停战变成持久的和平，并停止印度支那战争。我们坚决主张曾在促进停止朝鲜战争中起了重大作用的印度应该有代表参加这个会议。我们要求这个会议一致通过决议，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。”
    马德拉斯举行了全市大会，通过一项决议，呼吁大国在日内瓦会议上就议程中的主要问题达成协议。决议说：“马德拉斯市大会抗议美国用军事同盟和军事‘援助’形式干涉亚洲国家的内政。我们号召亚洲人民一致行动起来，抵抗那些力图统治他们的国家。大会认为美巴军事条约、美日军事协定和策划中的太平洋公约都是危害亚洲和平、使这个地区的紧张局势恶化的行动。”
    据新华社新德里讯：印度人民热烈欢迎正在举行的日内瓦会议。在四月二十五日，全印各地千百万爱好和平的人民纷纷举行“亚洲日”的活动，表示热望日内瓦会议成功。
    西孟加拉省各地在“亚洲日”举行了群众集会。在西孟加拉省学生联合会的号召下，加尔各答学生在四月二十四日晚举行了示威游行。参加游行的大学、专科学校和中小学的男女学生们，喊着“让日内瓦会议成功”的口号，并在加尔各答美国新闻处门前举行了示威。
    圣克累尔和平委员会组织的“亚洲日”集会通过一项决议，决议强调指出：日内瓦会议的召开是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。决议支持尼赫鲁总理提出的建议，要求在印度支那立即停火、外国军队撤出朝鲜、禁止原子弹和氢弹、恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位。
    印度共产党德里邦委员会在德里郊区举行了“亚洲日”群众大会，印度共产党中央委员会委员约·夏尔马在发言中欢迎尼赫鲁提出的在印度支那立即停火并要求禁止氢弹的建议。他说，这“有助于和平事业”。
    在巴地阿拉和东旁遮普邦联盟立法会议议员斯·纳·科斯拉主持下，巴地阿拉举行区人民代表会议。代表会议欢迎日内瓦会议的召开，希望会议成功并要求立即在印度支那停火。
    印度国会共产党议员团领袖阿·库·高普兰在拉贾斯坦邦首府斋浦尔的群众集会上发言，号召人民支持为和平而斗争的力量。
    孟买和平委员会和中央省和平委员会都举行了
  “亚洲日”的集会并通过决议支持尼赫鲁总理关于印度支那问题的声明。
    此外，比哈尔省、安得拉省、北方省、中央印度邦和东旁遮普省的重要城市的民众以及南印各省的农民也举行了各种集会，强烈谴责美国在亚洲的侵略阴谋，并表示对日内瓦会议的支持。
    据新华社讯：塔斯社雅加达讯：日内瓦会议已成为印度尼西亚报纸注意的中心。
      “永恒报”的社论说：“我们希望这次会议能带来具体的结果，以有助于缓和国际紧张局势。”该报要求参加日内瓦会议的人注意倾听亚洲人民的呼声，因为不考虑人民的意愿，“就不可能解决亚洲的重大问题”。
    “民族先锋报”指出：日内瓦会议将要克服巨大的困难，特别是在解决印度支那的尖锐冲突方面的困难。由于美国直接干涉的结果，这种冲突的范围是越来越大了。这种情况阻碍着日内瓦会议工作的顺利进行。
    “人民日报”说：“日内瓦会议面前有许多困难。为了克服危险和困难，全世界人民都应当支持日内瓦会议，使会议取得有效的成果。目前，印度尼西亚人民应当更广泛地展开争取和平的斗争。”
    【新华社雅加达一日电】印尼国会议员、大印尼党书记苏基赫四月三十日对本社记者发表谈话说：“日内瓦会议将为解决朝鲜和印度支那问题打开一条道路。”他说：“我十分赞成通过和平谈判来解决印度支那战争问题。我支持一切有助于实现和平的态度。我们也主张所有的人民都应该获得自由。殖民制度必须打倒，越南人民应该取得他们的自由和独立。”
    苏基赫对于印度总理尼赫鲁关于解决印度支那问题的声明表示赞同。
    另一位国会议员、印尼人民联盟党主席迪亚帕里在接见本社记者时说：他认为日内瓦会议十分重要。他对亚洲实现和平的前途表示乐观。他强调亚洲人民、包括中国人民在内，为了和平事业而团结一致的重要意义。他说，“要想排斥中华人民共和国于亚洲大家庭和国际事务之外，是不可能的。中国是一股和平力量，是一个有高度文化的大国，它是征服不了的。”他说，把中国说成侵略者，那是美国宣传的说法。他指出，美国才是到处干涉别人的事情。他说，“所谓美国对落后国家的援助，目的不过在于扩大美国的市场，并巩固它的战略地位。美国所建议的太平洋或东南亚同盟无疑地不是为了亚洲的利益，而是为了美国的利益。”
    迪亚帕里说，越南人民的斗争是反对法国侵略和美国干涉、争取自由的斗争的范例。他说：“我相信，越南人民一定会赢得他们的自由。”
    他又说：“我们要求亚洲人的亚洲，而不是亚洲人打亚洲人。我相信，亚洲各国人民建立良好的相互关系，将会有利于亚洲，有利于世界和平。”
    【新华社一日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会于四月二十六日举行记者招待会，报告关于日内瓦会议和缓和国际紧张局势的问题。招待会由缅甸保卫世界和平委员会秘书长吴巴迎主持。
    吴巴迎说，五大国终于召开了日内瓦会议，缅甸人民本着爱好和平的愿望，热烈欢迎并祝贺日内瓦会议的成功。吴巴迎指出：帝国主义向来是不经过亚洲国家的同意而武断解决亚洲问题的。今天和以前不同，在日内瓦会议上，已经有了中华人民共和国的代表出席参加讨论，因此日内瓦会议的成功召开，是世界人民和亚洲人民的和平成就。
    在谈到和平解决朝鲜问题时，吴巴迎主张和平统一朝鲜，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。
    在谈到恢复印度支那和平问题时，吴巴迎要求停火、美国终止干涉越南战争，法国和越南民主共和国和平协商解决印度支那问题。
    吴巴迎并说：日内瓦会议还应该广泛讨论和解决禁止使用大规模屠杀武器、裁减军备以及制止美国制造亚洲“军事同盟”以破坏亚洲人民和平生活等不利于世界和平的问题。
    吴巴迎最后号召缅甸人民提高警惕，防止好战分子企图使日内瓦会议破裂的阴谋，继续以更大努力去争取和平。
