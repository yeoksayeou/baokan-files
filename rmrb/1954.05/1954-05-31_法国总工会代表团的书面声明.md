    Written Statement of the French General Confederation of Labour Delegation

    At the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a delegation from the French General Confederation of Labour participated in the "May Day" celebrations in Beijing. It left France on the eve of the opening of the Geneva Conference.

    Each member of the delegation recognized the importance of this conference, which was to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the problems in Asia, particularly in resolving the issue of ending the war in Indochina, in addition to the Korean question. Therefore, the delegates paid close attention every day to the news they received, especially news related to the Indochina issue.

    They learned of the eight proposals put forward by Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in Geneva. The delegation of the French General Confederation of Labour in China believes that these moderate and reasonable proposals are a sincere expression of a firm will to seek peace, and form a genuine and serious basis for negotiations to achieve a ceasefire and armistice. This armistice is the strong demand of the people of Indochina and the French people, uniting men and women in Indochina and France, regardless of political views or religious beliefs.

    The visiting delegation of the French General Confederation of Labour met with a delegation of Vietnamese trade unions. The French General Confederation of Labour delegation deeply felt the Vietnamese working people's firm will to fight for peace, as well as their friendship with the French working people. Therefore, the sincerity expressed in the proposals put forward by the representatives of the Ho Chi Minh government in Geneva truly reflects the Vietnamese people's desire for peace.

    The representatives of the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China in Geneva, Molotov and Zhou Enlai, supported the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in their speeches. The increasingly obvious desire for peace shown by the Soviet Union is the same as the love of peace shown by the great People's Republic of China, which our delegation has just visited. Since the liberation of China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, in such a wise spirit of uniting all forces in the country, the economic construction of the new China has made us deeply feel its peaceful nature. The great efforts of the Chinese people to carry out large-scale production for the happiness of all the people are a powerful factor in the cause of peace. The economic transformation and renovation that are turning China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and that are being carried out for the welfare of the more than 500 million men and women of China, are powerful proof of the desire for peace. The Chinese people never miss any opportunity to express this peaceful desire with brotherly enthusiasm to the people of all countries. The admirable Chinese youth are educated to love peace and friendship between the people of all countries. All this completely shatters the lie that the threat of war comes from China, and also explains why the People's Republic of China supports the sincere peace proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Geneva.

    The delegation of the French General Confederation of Labour expresses agreement with and support for the delegations of many French working people and citizens who went to Geneva to see Piduault, as well as the proposals and telegrams sent daily from factories, cities, and villages across France to the French government.

    Despite the attempts of imperialists and colonialists, at the instigation of American imperialism, to sabotage the conference, the Geneva Conference should achieve positive results in realizing peace. It should quickly end the war in Indochina, because the continuation of military action would create a serious danger of a new world war.

    Similarly, the end of the war in Indochina can immediately bring the greatest possible improvement in economic and social conditions to the French and Indochinese people.

    Therefore, it is even more urgent and necessary for the French people, led by the French working people, to continuously strengthen the action of exerting pressure on the French government and its representatives in Geneva on the basis of increasingly broad unity.

    All foreign conspiracies should be crushed. France should re-implement her independent and autonomous policy.

    The delegation of the French General Confederation of Labour is trusted by the French people, and it knows that this appeal will be heard and supported by millions of peace-loving men and women around the world.

    Long live peace in Indochina!

    Long live world peace!

    法国总工会代表团的书面声明
    在中华全国总工会的邀请下，一个法国总工会代表团参加了北京“五一”节观礼，它是在日内瓦会议开幕的前夜离开法国的。
    代表团的每一个团员都认识这一次会议的重要性，它要协商和平解决亚洲的问题，特别是在解决朝鲜问题之外，还要解决结束印度支那战争的问题。因此，代表们每天都非常注视着所获得的消息，尤其是和印度支那问题有关的消息。
    他们获悉了越南民主共和国副总理、代理外交部长范文同在日内瓦提出的八项建议。在中国的法国总工会代表团认为这些温和而合理的建议，是要求和平的坚定意志的真诚表现，并且成了为达到停火和停战而必须进行的谈判的真诚严肃的基础。这种停战是印度支那人民和法国人民的强烈的要求，它已使印度支那和法国的不管政治见解与宗教信仰如何的男女团结一致了。
    访问中国的法国总工会代表团曾与越南工会代表团会晤。法国总工会代表团深深体会到越南劳动人民争取和平的坚决意志，以及他们与法国劳动人民的友谊。因此，胡志明政府的代表在日内瓦所提出的建议中所表现的真心诚意，确实表示出越南人民要求和平的愿望。
    苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府在日内瓦的代表莫洛托夫和周恩来，在他们的发言中，支持了越南民主共和国的建议。苏联所表现的日益明显的和平愿望和我们代表团刚刚访问了的伟大的中华人民共和国对和平的爱好是一样的。自中国解放以来，在毛泽东主席如此英明的团结全国一切力量的精神的领导下的新中国的经济建设，使我们深深地感觉到它的和平性质。中国人民为了全体人民的幸福而进行大规模生产的伟大努力，就是和平事业的一个强有力的因素。使中国从一个落后的农业国变为一个先进的工业国，并为中国五亿以上男女人民的福利而进行的经济改造和革新，就是和平愿望的有力的证明。中国人民从不放过任何机会以兄弟般的热情向世界各国人民一致表示这种和平愿望。令人钦佩的中国青年所受的教育就是热爱和平、和各国人民间的友谊。这一切完全粉碎了战争威胁来自中国的谎言，同时也说明了为什么中华人民共和国在日内瓦支持越南民主共和国的真诚的和平建议。
    法国总工会代表团对于到日内瓦去见皮杜尔的许多法国劳动人民和公民们的代表团以及每天从法国各工厂、城市、乡村给法国政府的提案和电报，表示同意和支持。
    尽管帝国主义者和殖民主义者在美帝国主义指使下企图破坏会议，日内瓦会议应当达到实现和平的积极结果。它应该迅速结束印度支那战争，因为军事行动的继续会造成新的世界战争的严重危险。
    同样，印度支那战争的结束可以立刻给法国人民和印度支那人民带来经济与社会条件最大可能的改善。
    因此，以法国劳动人民为首的法国人民在日益广泛的团结基础上，不断地加强对法国政府和其在日内瓦的代表的压力的行动更为迫切和必要了。
    应该粉碎一切外国的阴谋。法国应该重新执行她独立自主的政策。
    法国总工会代表团受到法国人民的信任，它知道这个呼吁将会得到全世界千百万爱好和平的男女的倾听和支持。
    印度支那和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
