    China Food Company Jiangsu Province Company
    Purchased Large Quantities of Hogs and Eggs
    This year, from January to April, the China Food Company Jiangsu Province Company purchased 66% more hogs than in the same period last year, and more than four times as many fresh eggs. During these four months, 600,000 hogs were transported to Shanghai via transit stations in Xingan, Zhenjiang, Pukou, and other places, and 11.9 million jin of fresh eggs were transported to Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Anshan, and other cities. In addition to meeting the needs of the people in various regions, a portion of these hogs and fresh eggs are supplied to the state for processing and export.
    Jiangsu Province has a large output of hogs and eggs. To meet the farmers' demands for selling hogs, eggs, and other non-staple foods, the Provincial Food Company and supply and marketing cooperatives have increased the number of purchasing points from more than 200 last year to more than 500 this year. Some purchasing points also use the method of pre-purchasing hogs, so that farmers can get the support of the state during the hog-raising period. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国食品公司江苏省公司
    收购了大量毛猪和鸡蛋
    中国食品公司江苏省公司今年一月到四月收购的毛猪比去年同期增加百分之六十六，收购的鲜鸡蛋比去年同期增加四倍以上。在这四个月中，经新港、镇江、浦口等地的转运站运往上海的毛猪达六十万头，运往上海、北京、天津、鞍山等城市的鲜鸡蛋有一千一百九十万斤。这些毛猪和鲜蛋除供应各地人民需要外，并有一部分供给国家加工出口。
    江苏省毛猪和鸡蛋产量很多。为满足农民出售毛猪和鸡蛋等副食品的要求，省食品公司和供销合作社今年已把收购点由去年的两百多个增加到五百多个。有的收购点并采用预购毛猪的方式，使农民在饲养毛猪期间就可得到国家的支持。           （新华社）
