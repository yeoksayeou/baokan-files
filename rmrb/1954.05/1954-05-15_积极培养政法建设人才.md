    Actively Cultivate Talents for Political and Legal Construction
  　The National Conference on Political and Legal Education, which closed on the 8th of this month, has determined the direction, tasks, and training objectives of political and legal education based on the characteristics and needs of political and legal work during the transition period, stipulated the length of schooling for political and legal colleges, and drafted a unified teaching plan. This has an extremely important impact on the improvement and development of political and legal education throughout the country.
    Over the past four years, with the consolidation of our country's people's democratic dictatorship and the progress of political and legal work, political and legal education has also achieved certain results. This is mainly manifested in: training more than 100,000 cadres in public security, justice, procuratorate, civil affairs, and other fields, improving the political and professional level of the original cadres, rectifying the old political and legal departments, establishing new political and legal colleges, criticizing the reactionary Kuomintang Six Codes ideology, establishing the ideological leadership of the working class, and training more than 5,000 young students, supplementing a new force for political and legal work. These achievements, especially the achievements of cadre training, have played a certain role in consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship. However, there are still some urgent problems to be solved in the current political and legal education work. Some political and legal educators do not have a sufficient understanding of the particularity of political and legal education, do not fully understand the training policy of focusing on the in-service training of cadres in the recent two or three years while paying close attention to the training of students in specialized colleges, do not adequately implement the teaching policy of combining theory with practice and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's actual conditions, and do not have a clear understanding of the teaching reform of political and legal colleges, the preparation of teachers and teaching materials, training objects, training objectives, and the length of schooling. All of this has limited the development and improvement of political and legal education.
    The basic task of political and legal work during the transition period is to further improve the people's democratic system, strengthen and apply the people's democratic legal system, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings. According to this task, the direction of political and legal education in the future should be: to adapt to the needs of the development of political and legal work, to cultivate, in a planned and proportional manner, working cadres and legal scholars who are loyal to the cause of socialist construction, love the motherland, are physically fit, have a firm working-class stand and socialist political and legal views, master advanced political and legal science, and are familiar with specialized political and legal business. In order to cultivate talents that meet these requirements, political and legal education must, in the future, further implement the teaching policy of combining theory with practice and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's actual conditions, actively carry out teaching reforms, and improve teaching quality, in accordance with the working policy of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improved quality, and steady progress"; in the recent two or three years, adopt the method of focusing on short-term in-service training of cadres and paying close attention to the training of students in specialized colleges, on the one hand improving in-service cadres, and on the other hand cultivating specialized talents, in order to meet the current needs and future development requirements. Correctly grasping the characteristics of political and legal education and actively further carrying out teaching reforms is the basic guarantee for realizing the above-mentioned policies and tasks.
    The content of political and legal education and legal science has extremely strong class characteristics. The reactionary political and legal education of old China served the reactionary ruling class at that time. The old so-called legal theories were anti-people and anti-scientific, and must be thoroughly criticized. New political and legal education must be established on a new basis. In the early days of liberation, the education leadership departments carried out curriculum reforms in political and legal departments, stopped teaching the Six Codes, and carried out departmental adjustments, established new political and legal departments, and at the same time led political and legal teachers to actively carry out ideological remolding work, all of which were completely necessary. However, the reactionary bourgeois political and legal views must undergo long-term and serious ideological struggle before they can be gradually eliminated. The view that problems can be solved after a short period of political and ideological remolding or after one or two social reform movements is incorrect. Therefore, in the future, we must continue to criticize the old legal theories and thoroughly expose their anti-people essence.
    In the process of reforming political and legal education, a distinction should be made between the old reactionary political and legal education and the original political and legal teachers who were seriously engaged in teaching. The former needs to be thoroughly criticized. As for the original political and legal teachers, as long as they sincerely ask for progress, they can still be transformed into people's political and legal teachers. Some of them have made great progress, and some are working hard to make progress. The leadership should actively help them make continuous progress in teaching, research, further studies, or other work. The Party's policy of winning over, uniting, and transforming intellectuals is equally applicable to them.
    Our country is in a new period of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation, and the class struggle is extremely complex and sharp. In this struggle, political and legal work is different from the political and legal work in the past armed struggles and social reform movements. It not only needs to mobilize the strength of the people, but also needs to further strengthen and apply the people's democratic legal system, and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, so as to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and various socialist transformation undertakings. That is to say, we not only need general judicial and procuratorial cadres, but also specialized talents such as specialized courts and specialized procuratorates in industrial and mining areas, railways, water transportation, etc., as well as legal advisors and notaries in business departments. This is a new problem posed by the new situation to political and legal work. Based on this characteristic of political and legal work, summarizing the experience of current cadre training and further carrying out teaching reforms in political and legal departments has become an urgent task for improving the quality of political and legal teaching. All political and legal educators should recognize that the teaching policy of combining theory with practice and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's actual conditions is equally applicable to all levels and types of political and legal schools. All conservative tendencies that do not seriously study the advanced experience of Soviet political and legal teaching work, are satisfied with the old ways, and stick to the old rules, as well as practices that do not pay attention to contact with business departments and do not earnestly study and summarize the experience of political and legal work, will hinder the improvement of the quality of political and legal teaching.
    After clearly recognizing the above-mentioned characteristics, political and legal educators will naturally know that the training objects of political and legal education must have excellent political quality and appropriate cultural level, will understand the importance of increasing the proportion of worker-peasant students and strengthening political education for young students; will recognize that it is a glorious task for political and legal colleges to simultaneously train cadres, and will not feel that it is a burden.
    In order to improve the theoretical, policy, and professional capabilities of existing cadres, especially the leading backbone of political and legal affairs at the county level, we must adopt the principle of division of labor and cooperation between the central and local governments, and combining short-term training with long-term cultivation, and strive to train the leading backbone of each political and legal department above the county (city) level in a cycle of two or three years; at the same time, during the first five-year plan period, we must train 10,000 undergraduate and specialized students to continuously enrich the political and legal work departments. Short-term in-service training of cadres, long-term cultivation of young students, and continuously increasing the proportion of worker-peasant students are one of the main signs of the correct embodiment of the class line in political and legal education. The key to achieving these tasks lies in the preparation of teachers and teaching materials. The administrative departments of political and legal education should immediately start to formulate specific plans and urge all schools to implement them earnestly. The Law Department of Renmin University of China and the Central School for Political and Legal Cadres should continue to play their role as "working mother machines," and should also train more teachers for various schools, step up the compilation and translation of teaching materials, establish contacts with relevant teaching and research sections of various schools, and introduce advanced experience in a timely manner. Political and legal departments in various schools must also actively unite and improve existing teachers, cultivate new teachers in a planned manner, and train some existing administrative cadres suitable for teaching work to transfer them to teaching work. In short, we must actively create conditions, overcome difficulties, and not rely solely on foreign aid, and relax our own efforts.
    To run political and legal colleges well, we must rely on the leadership and supervision of party and government leading organs at all levels. Political and legal departments and political and legal colleges at all levels should strengthen requests for instructions and reports to party and government leading organs in order to obtain instructions in a timely manner. Political and legal departments at all levels must especially strengthen their assistance and guidance to political and legal colleges on policy, business teaching work, and appropriately assign the necessary number of cadres to enrich the teaching backbone of the schools. Party and government leading organs at all levels should continue to strengthen their leadership over political and legal education, and regularly check and supervise this work.
    Political and legal educators across the country should earnestly and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and advanced Soviet political and legal science, and earnestly study the general line, so as to improve socialist consciousness, and use this as a weapon to regularly criticize reactionary old legal views, further strengthen contacts with business departments, summarize the practical experience of Chinese political and legal work, so as to further develop new political and legal science and cultivate the political and legal construction talents needed by the country.

### 积极培养政法建设人才

    积极培养政法建设人才
  　本月八日闭幕的全国政法教育会议，根据过渡时期政法工作的特点和需要，确定了政法教育的方针、任务和培养目标，规定了政法学院的学制，拟订了统一的教学计划。这对于全国政法教育的提高和发展，有着极其重大的作用。
    四年以来，随着我国人民民主专政的巩固和政法工作的进展，政法教育工作也获得了一定的成绩。这主要表现在：轮训了十万名以上的公安、司法、检察、民政等方面的干部，提高了原有干部的政治和业务水平，整顿了旧有的政法系科，成立了新的政法学院，批判了反动的国民党六法观点，树立了工人阶级的思想领导，并培养了青年学生五千余人，为政法工作补充了一批新的力量。这些成绩，尤其是轮训干部工作的成绩，对于人民民主专政的巩固和发展，起了一定的作用。但目前政法教育工作中还存在着一些急待解决的问题。有些政法教育工作者对政法教育的特殊性认识不足，对在最近二、三年内以轮训在职干部为主，同时切实注意培养专科以上学校学生的培养方针了解不够，对理论联系实际、学习苏联先进经验和中国实际情况相结合的教学方针贯彻不够，对政法学院的教学改革，师资教材的准备，训练对象、培养目标和学制等方面的认识不够明确。凡此一切，都限制了政法教育工作的发展和提高。
    过渡时期政法工作的基本任务是：进一步健全人民民主制度，加强和运用人民民主法制，巩固人民民主专政，以保障国家的社会主义经济建设和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。根据这个任务，今后政法教育的方针应该是：适应政法工作发展的需要，有计划、按比例地培养忠于社会主义建设事业、热爱祖国、体格健全、具有坚定的工人阶级立场和社会主义政法观点、掌握先进政法科学，熟悉专门政法业务的工作干部和法律学家。为了培养合乎这种要求的人才，今后政法教育必须根据“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针，进一步贯彻理论和实际相结合、学习苏联先进经验和中国实际情况相结合的教学方针，积极进行教学改革，提高教学质量；在最近二、三年内采取短期轮训在职干部为主并切实注意培养专科以上学校学生的办法，一方面提高在职干部，一方面培养专门人才，以适应目前的需要和将来的发展要求。而正确地掌握政法教育的特点，积极地进一步进行教学改革，便是实现上述的方针任务的基本保证。
    政法教育和法律科学的内容具有极强烈的阶级性。旧中国的反动的政法教育是为当时反动的统治阶级服务的。旧的所谓法律理论是反人民、反科学的，必须予以彻底批判，新的政法教育必须在新的基础上建立起来。解放初期，教育领导部门即进行了政法院系的课程改革，停止了六法全书的讲授，并进行了院系调整，建立了新的政法院系，同时领导政法教师积极进行了思想改造工作，这都是完全必要的。但是，反动的资产阶级政治法律观点，必须经过长期的、严重的思想斗争，才能逐步清除。那种以为经过短期的政治思想改造或者经过一次两次社会改革运动就可以解决问题的看法，是不对的。因此，今后必须对旧的法律理论继续进行批判，彻底揭发其反人民的本质。
    在政法教育的改革过程中，应该把旧的反动政法教育和原有的认真从事教学的政法教师区别开来，前者是需要彻底批判的，至于原有的政法教师，只要他们真心诚意地要求进步，仍然是可以改造成为人民的政法教师的。其中有些人已有了很大的进步，有些人正在努力求进步，领导方面应积极帮助他们在教学、研究、进修或其他工作当中不断的进步，党的关于争取、团结、改造知识分子的政策对于他们是同样适用的。
    我们的国家正处在社会主义革命即社会主义改造的新时期，阶级斗争是极其复杂和尖锐的。在这个斗争中，政法工作已经和过去的历次武装斗争与社会改革运动中的政法工作有所不同，它不仅需要发动人民群众的力量，而且需要进一步加强和运用人民民主的法制，进一步巩固人民民主专政，以保障社会主义建设和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。这就是说，我们不仅需要一般的司法、检察干部，而且需要工矿区、铁路、水运等等的专门法院和专门检察署以至业务部门的法律顾问、公证人等等的专门人才。这是新的形势向政法工作提出的新的问题。根据政法工作的这一特点，把目前轮训干部的经验加以总结，并在政法院系中进一步进行教学改革，就成为提高政法教学质量的当前急务。全体政法教育工作者都应该认识，理论联系实际，学习苏联先进经验和中国实际情况相结合的教学方针，是同样适用于各级各类政法学校的。一切不认真学习苏联政法教学工作的先进经验，满足于老一套，故步自封的保守偏向以及不重视和业务部门联系，不切实研究总结政法工作经验的做法，都会妨碍政法教学质量的提高。
    在明确地认识了上述特点以后，政法教育工作者自然就会知道政法教育的培养对象必须具有优良的政治质量和适当的文化水平，就会懂得增加工农学生比重及对青年学生加强政治教育的重要性；就会认识政法学院同时轮训干部乃是光荣的任务，而不会感到是一种负担。
    为了提高现有的干部特别是县级政法领导骨干的理论、政策水平和业务能力，必须采取中央和地方分工合作、短期训练和长期培养相结合的原则，争取把县（市）以上各政法部门的领导骨干在二、三年内轮训一遍；同时，在第一个五年计划时期内，要培养一万名本科和专修科的学生，以不断充实政法工作部门。短期轮训在职干部、长期培养青年学生并不断增加工农学生的比重，这是政法教育正确体现阶级路线的主要标志之一。实现这些任务的关键，在于师资和教材的准备。政法教育行政部门应即着手拟定具体计划，并督促各校切实执行。中国人民大学法律系及中央政法干部学校除应继续发挥其“工作母机”的作用外，还应更多地为各校培养师资，加紧编译教材，和各校有关教研室建立联系，将先进经验及时加以介绍。而各政法院系也须积极地团结和提高现有教师，有计划地培养新教师，把现有的一些适于教学工作的行政干部加以训练，使之转到教学工作方面。总之要积极地创造条件，克服困难，而不要专门依赖外援，放松了自己的努力。
    要办好政法院校必须依靠各级党政领导机关的领导和监督。各级政法部门和政法院校应加强向党政领导机关的请示报告，以便及时取得指示。各政法部门尤须切实加强对各政法院校关于政策、业务教学工作的帮助和指导，并酌派必要数量的干部充实学校的教学骨干。各级党政领导机关则应继续加强对政法教育的领导，经常检查和督促这方面的工作。
    全国政法教育工作者应该切实地有系统地学习马克思列宁主义和苏联先进政法科学，认真地学习总路线，以提高社会主义觉悟，并以此为武器，经常地批判反动的旧法观点，进一步加强和业务部门的联系，总结中国政法工作的实际经验，以进一步发展新的政法科学，培养国家所需要的政法建设人才。
