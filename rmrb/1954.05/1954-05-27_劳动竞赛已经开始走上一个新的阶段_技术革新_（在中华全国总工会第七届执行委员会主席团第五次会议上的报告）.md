Labor Competition Has Begun to Enter a New Stage—Technological Innovation
(Report at the Fifth Meeting of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions)
Lai Ruoyu

At the third Presidium meeting in October 1953, a resolution was passed to further advance the labor competition, the basic requirement of which was to gradually guide the labor competition from the mass movement of rationalization proposals and promotion of advanced experience to a direction with technological innovation as the main content. Practice over the past six months has shown that this resolution is in line with objective reality. It seems that it can be said that it was from that time (after the launch of the technological innovation movement in Anshan Iron and Steel) that the national labor competition began to enter a new stage.

According to incomplete statistics, from 1953 to the first quarter of 1954, there were a total of 109 relatively significant technological innovation achievements. Among them, there were 2 in the first quarter of 1953, accounting for 1.83%; 14 in the second quarter, accounting for 12.84%; 20 in the third quarter, accounting for 18.35%; 32 in the fourth quarter, accounting for 29.36%; and 41 in the first quarter of 1954, accounting for 37.62%. These 109 technological innovations are distributed in 20 industrial production units including steel, machinery, clothing, textile, cigarette, rubber, construction, electrical, printing, railway, chemical, municipal, coal mining, paper making, highway transportation, paint, flour, leather, grain processing, and tea production. Among the main figures in the 109 innovation achievements: 73 skilled workers; 17 technicians, engineers, and technical personnel; 18 administrative management personnel such as workshop directors and factory directors; 3 ordinary workers; 3 ordinary staff members; and 1 student still studying at university. These innovative initiatives have not only appeared in larger factories and mining enterprises, but also in smaller enterprises.

Local Party newspapers have reported on technological innovation initiatives in special columns, and published editorials, short commentaries, and reprinted news of major technological innovation movements in various regions. Many regions and enterprises have held mobilization meetings, award ceremonies, training courses, organized exhibitions, set up technological innovation exhibition halls, and some have even made decisions or issued notices calling on and mobilizing employees to learn the creative spirit of technological innovators.

Some places have established models of technological innovation in their regions and units.

The above situation shows that technological innovation has begun to be mobilized throughout the country. This has given the labor competition new content and has begun to enter a new stage.

If the above analysis of the situation is correct, then our current and long-term task in labor competition is to consciously lead this technological innovation movement. Combine the promotion of advanced experience with rationalization proposals to mobilize the masses to improve the technology of our country's industry, tap the potential of enterprises, continuously improve labor productivity, increase new products, improve product quality and project quality, and ensure the comprehensive completion and strive to overfulfill the state's production plan and basic construction plan. The Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition currently being held is precisely for this purpose.

Regarding some basic issues in carrying out technological innovation, the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel, although it has its specific conditions, also has its universal significance and is worthy of reference. These experiences have been introduced in the past, and the Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition introduces them in more detail this time.

Now, several labor models who participated in the opening ceremony of the Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition have held two symposiums. They suggested launching a technological innovation movement nationwide and drafted a proposal for submission to the Presidium for study.

I think we can agree to this suggestion and launch such a movement.

The movement mentioned here refers to the gradual development of technological innovation into a widespread, mass-based scale. Such a movement should not be a sudden, intensive campaign, but a regular one.

Such a movement does not need to conduct national or regional competitions. However, each innovation achievement must be technically appraised, and these advanced experiences should be promoted according to the specific conditions of each enterprise. Of course, labor competitions must be summarized and evaluated. That is based on the conditions of the competition, not the evaluation of the technological innovation itself.

In order to strengthen the leadership of labor competition, it is necessary for the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the national committees of various industrial trade unions, and the provincial and municipal federations of trade unions to establish production departments.

To strengthen the leadership of labor competition, the management and education of labor models should be studied, and a method should be formulated and recommended to the government for promulgation and implementation. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is currently drafting such a method.

The suggestion to the State Council regarding the reward methods for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals is also very necessary.

### 劳动竞赛已经开始走上一个新的阶段——技术革新 （在中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第五次会议上的报告）

    劳动竞赛已经开始走上一个新的阶段——技术革新
    （在中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第五次会议上的报告）
    赖若愚
    一九五三年十月第三次主席团会议的时候，曾通过把劳动竞赛向前推进一步的决议，其基本要求是把劳动竞赛从合理化建议与推广先进经验的群众运动基础上，逐步地引导到以技术革新为主要内容的方向上来。半年来实践说明这个决议是符合于客观情况的。似乎可以说，正是从那个时候（鞍钢技术革新运动展开之后）起，全国的劳动竞赛开始走上一个新的阶段。
    根据不完全的统计：从一九五三年至一九五四年第一季度止，比较重大的技术革新事迹共计一百零九件。其中一九五三年第一季度有二件，占百分之一点八三；第二季度有十四件，占百分之十二点八四；第三季度有二十件，占百分之十八点三五；第四季度有三十二件，占百分之二十九点三六；一九五四年第一季度有四十一件，占百分之三十七点六二。这一百零九件技术革新分布在钢铁、机器、被服、纺织、卷烟、橡胶、建筑、电工、印刷、铁路、化学、市政、煤矿、造纸、公路运输、油漆、面粉、皮革、粮食加工、制茶等二十种工业生产单位中。在一百零九件革新事迹的主要人物当中：技术工人七十三名；技师、工程师、技术员十七名；车间主任、厂长等行政管理人员十八名；普通工人三名；普通职员三名；尚在大学读书的学生一名。这些技术革新的创举不仅出现在较大的厂矿企业中，同时，也出现在较小的企业里。
    各地党报都以专栏报道了技术革新的创举，并发表社论、短评，转载各地重大的技术革新运动的消息。许多地区和企业单位召开了动员大会、奖励大会，举办训练班，组织展览会，设置技术革新陈列馆，有的还作出了决定或发出了通知，号召与动员职工群众学习技术革新者的创造精神。
    有些地方已树立了本地区、本单位的技术革新的榜样。
    以上情况说明，技术革新已开始在全国各地动员起来。这就使劳动竞赛具备了新的内容，开始走上了一个新的阶段。
    如果以上对于情况的分析不错的话，那么，在劳动竞赛方面，我们当前的也是今后一个长时期的任务，就是自觉地领导这个技术革新运动。结合推广先进经验与合理化建议发动群众来提高我国工业的技术，发掘企业潜在力量，不断地提高劳动生产率，增加新产品，提高产品质量和工程质量，保证全面完成并争取超额完成国家生产计划和基本建设计划。目前正在举行的鞍钢技术革新展览会，也正是为了这个目的。
    关于开展技术革新的一些基本问题，鞍钢的经验虽有其特定的条件，但也有其普遍的意义，是值得参考的。这些经验过去已经介绍过，此次鞍钢技术革新展览会更详细地介绍了。
    现在，参加鞍钢技术革新展览会开幕式的几位劳动模范开过两次座谈会，他们建议在全国范围内发起一个技术革新运动，并且草拟了一个建议书，提交主席团研究。
    我想可以同意这个建议，展开这样一个运动。
    这里所说的运动，是指技术革新逐步走向广泛的具有群众性的规模而言，这样的运动，不能是突击式的运动，而是经常性的。
    这样的运动，不必进行全国性或地区性的评比。但是每一件革新的事迹，都必须在经过技术鉴定之后，把这些先进经验根据各个企业的具体情况加以推广。当然，劳动竞赛是要进行总结、评比的，那是根据竞赛条件来总结、评比，而不是技术革新本身的评比。
    为了加强对于劳动竞赛的领导，全国总工会、各产业工会全国委员会、各省市工会联合会有必要把生产部建立起来。
      为了加强劳动竞赛的领导，对于劳动模范的管理和教育问题应该加以研究，拟定一个办法，建议政府颁布施行。这样的办法，全国总工会正在草拟中。
  关于发明、技术改进、合理化建议的奖励办法，已向政务院提出建议，这也是很必要的。
