Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to a report from the Indian News Service on the 21st, Indian public opinion opposes the signing of the US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement."

　　The "Hindustan Standard" commented that this military "aid" agreement "expands the area where war may occur." The newspaper believes that Indian public opinion has already expressed its opposition to the agreement "in unambiguous terms and with emphasis," and expressed dissatisfaction with "no visible changes in American policy."

　　The editorial in "The Times of India" said: "Karachi's actions not only damage the peaceful region cherished by Asia, but also help foreign countries bring the Cold War into Asia." The newspaper believes that, judging from the clauses of the agreement, the statement regarding "not involving the provision of military bases" for use by the United States is "difficult to believe," because "military alliances imply the provision and use of military bases and their accessories."

    印度舆论反对美巴“共同防御援助协定”
    据新华社讯：据印度新闻处二十一日讯：印度舆论反对美巴“共同防御援助协定”的签订。
      “印度斯坦旗报”评论说：这一军事“援助”协定“扩大了可能发生战事的地区”。该报认为印度舆论已经“用毫不含糊的词句和强调的语气”表达了对这一协定的反对，并对“美国的政策没有可以看得见的改变”表示不满。
    “印度时报”的社论说：“喀喇蚩的行动不只是损害了亚洲所珍惜的和平地区。它帮助外国把冷战带进亚洲”。该报认为：从协定条文看，关于
  “不牵涉到提供军事基地”给美国使用的声明，是
  “很难令人信服的”，因为“军事同盟就包含着提供和使用军事基地及其附属品的意思”。
