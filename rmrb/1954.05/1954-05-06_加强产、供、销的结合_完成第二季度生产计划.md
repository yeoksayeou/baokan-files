Strengthen the Integration of Production, Supply, and Sales
Complete the Second Quarter Production Plan

    In the first quarter of 1954, under the encouragement of the general task of the state's transition period, and thanks to the efforts of all employees, state-owned industrial enterprises made relatively sufficient preparations before production and took some necessary and specific measures. Party committees provided strong guarantees and supervision, and trade unions and the Communist Youth League carried out many specific tasks among employees. In addition, enterprises strengthened mutual cooperation, thus fundamentally changing the past phenomenon of slackness at the beginning of the year and poor production in January and February. The national plan was completed and overfulfilled. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the total output value of the six central industrial ministries in the first quarter reached 105.1% of the quarterly plan, an increase of 32.2% compared to the first quarter of 1953, and approximately 23% of the annual plan. The overfulfillment of the state production plan in the first quarter and the good production situation have created favorable conditions for completing the second quarter and the annual state production plan.
    The general requirement of the state for state-owned industrial enterprises in the second quarter of 1954 is: on the basis of the first quarter's production, to further improve enterprise management, and under the premise of ensuring quality, marketability of products, and guaranteed supply of raw materials, except for individual departments, the total output value should generally complete about 25% of the annual plan, and strive to complete about 27%. That is to say, the production in the second quarter plus the production in the first quarter should reach 48% of the annual state plan, striving to reach about 50% of the annual plan. At the same time, it is also necessary to complete the corresponding labor, finance, cost, and technical organization measures plans.
    In order to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the state production plan for the second quarter, it is natural to need to make great efforts, to do many complex and specific tasks, and to overcome many difficulties. Among them, a relatively important issue that must be paid special attention to is the integration of production, supply, and sales. Therefore, paying attention to and solving the integration of production, supply, and sales in the second quarter has become one of the keys for economic departments to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the national plan.
    Regardless of the past and the present, state-owned industrial departments and national economic departments have made great efforts and done many complex tasks in the integration of production, supply, and sales. Therefore, except for individual departments, the balance of production, supply, and sales has been basically maintained, ensuring the needs of national construction and people's production and life, promoting the development of the national economy, and ensuring that state-owned industry advances healthily and at a fairly high rate of development. However, there are still shortcomings in the integration of production, supply, and sales. Some industrial production authorities did not adequately study the supply and sales situation when compiling the production plan for the first quarter; some requesting departments did not submit orders to production departments early enough; some supply departments did not formulate raw material supply plans in accordance with production plans and basic construction plans. As a result, some industrial departments experienced certain imbalances in production, supply, and sales, causing production difficulties and capital turnover difficulties for some industrial production departments. The reasons for this phenomenon are mainly that the various enterprise departments have not studied the economic situation sufficiently, have not grasped the needs of the country and the market and their changes, and the organization is not good. In addition, some departments underestimated the situation in the first quarter of this year when preparing for production in the first quarter of this year in the fourth quarter of last year, and did not put forward different production requirements according to the specific situation of each enterprise based on the situation of production, supply, and sales. In the future, we must earnestly and practically understand, study and analyze the economic situation, strengthen the connection between production, supply, and sales departments, do a good job in production, supply, and sales, and promote the normal development of production.
    Production, supply, and sales are a unified whole. Only by combining these three aspects can the national economy develop normally. Not only state-owned industry but also local industry must pay attention to the integration of production, supply, and sales. All regions should organize regional balance well according to the overall national balance. The key to the integration of production, supply, and sales is to strengthen the planning of production, supply, and sales, and to strengthen mutual assistance and close cooperation between production, supply, and sales departments.
    In the production department, production plans must be compiled according to the needs of national construction and the people, as well as the raw material situation, and the production plans must be sent to the relevant supply departments and sales departments so that they can formulate supply and sales plans accordingly, so that the production plans have a reliable basis. China's industry is based on the domestic market. Without understanding the needs of the country and the people, without understanding the domestic market situation, and without linking production with supply and sales, it is impossible to accurately organize planned production, and it may even lead to adverse results in production, causing waste of national wealth. In order to meet the needs of the entire society, it is necessary to further tap the potential of enterprises and increase production under the conditions of stable production quality and guaranteed supply and sales. Due to the growth of national construction and the needs of the people, certain products can no longer meet the needs in terms of variety and quality. Therefore, our state-owned industrial enterprises must continuously improve their technical level, improve product quality, and plan to produce more new varieties. The task of trial-producing new products in the second quarter is quite arduous for some state-owned industrial departments. They must overcome difficulties and complete the new product trial-production plan bravely, resolutely, and steadily. To this end, it is necessary to quickly establish and enrich product design institutions, allocate and train product design cadres, and strengthen production cooperation between state-owned industrial departments. If there is a certainty in technology, raw materials, and quality after trial production, small-batch production can be organized first, and then mass production can be organized according to needs.
    Due to the development of national construction and production, the work of raw material supply has become increasingly important, and the tasks undertaken by the supply department have become increasingly heavy. In order to enable the supply work to better guarantee the needs of basic construction and production, the supply department must formulate its own supply plan in accordance with the basic construction plan and production plan, and effectively carry out planned management of raw material supply. In order to ensure supply and avoid waste, the supply department should conduct unified procurement according to needs and possibilities. Procurement must meet the requirements of variety, specifications, and quality according to the needs of production and basic construction. In general, attention should be paid to the following when purchasing: those available in the department should not be purchased from other departments; those allocated by the state should not be purchased from the market; those available locally should not be purchased from other places; those available domestically should not be ordered from abroad. A very important issue in the supply of raw materials is the strict implementation of the raw material saving system. Saving is an important source of socialist accumulation, and saving raw materials is of greater economic significance, because raw materials are the main factor constituting the cost of products. Raw materials account for 70% to 80% of the cost of many enterprise departments, and some even account for more than 80%. Saving raw materials will greatly save national resources and greatly reduce production costs, thereby accumulating more funds for the country. The main methods of saving raw materials are to effectively establish the original record of raw material consumption, issue materials in accordance with consumption quotas, and continuously reduce raw material consumption quotas without affecting product quality; while issuing materials within the limit, the material return system should also be resolutely implemented, and all excess materials must be returned. Seriously clearing warehouses and handling stagnant materials is an important method of tapping the potential of raw materials. Each enterprise department should organize forces to effectively carry out this work. In the process of clearing, a warehouse management system should be established and improved, and reasonable reserves should be effectively stipulated. In view of the possible shortage of certain raw materials in the second quarter, the supply department must make every effort to meet production needs and complete the supply plan. For those with insufficient raw materials, they should actively find sources. If substitutes can be used, employees and technicians should be mobilized to actively find substitutes, and a waste recovery system for important materials should be effectively established.
    Sales work plays an important role in planned production and planned distribution. Planned sales are one of the main tools for accelerating production development, because the socialist nature of state-owned industrial production is produced according to needs. If the production unit does not know the needs of the product, it will inevitably form blind production. At present, it is naturally difficult to fully understand the needs, but our sales department must strive to gradually achieve this. The sales department must strive to serve the production department and the requesting department, and make the production and needs well combined. At present, in order to combine production and needs, order meetings should be held well and order contracts should be signed. After the requesting department and the production department sign the order contract, the sales department should strengthen supervision and inspection to ensure that both parties effectively fulfill the contract. The production department must complete the product varieties and specifications on schedule and deliver the goods in a timely manner in accordance with the order contract. The ordering department should pick up the goods and pay in a timely manner. Those who fail to fulfill the contract shall compensate the other party for economic losses. In the first quarter, many sales departments have organized order meetings, which have played a considerable role in the integration of production and sales. In the second quarter, they should urge all departments to earnestly fulfill the contract, strive to achieve balance in production and sales in the second quarter, avoid disconnection between production and sales, and plan to organize orders for the second half of this year. In order to promote the development of China's industry, the sales department should implement planned sales, should understand the production capacity of China's industry, especially state-owned industry, should seriously participate in and review foreign orders, and should strive to place orders domestically for products that domestic industry can produce and supply on time with certainty in production technology and raw material supply.
    In order to strengthen the integration of production, supply, and sales, cadres in all departments must also effectively understand the economic situation, strengthen political study, study their profession, actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and unremittingly improve their political and professional level. Since supply and sales work is relatively weak at present, the competent authorities should appropriately enrich the supply and sales institutions, allocate necessary cadres, and quickly establish supply and sales branches. Production, supply and sales are all important and indispensable. The idea of only valuing production and neglecting supply and sales is wrong.
    In closely integrating production, supply and sales, transportation plays an important role. Production and supply and sales departments must submit transportation plans to the transportation department in a timely manner, so that the transportation department can distinguish between urgency and plan, reasonably and accurately complete the transportation tasks of products and raw materials. Production and supply and sales departments should try their best to obtain materials locally under a unified plan, so as to gradually reduce and avoid the phenomenon of long-distance transportation and opposite transportation.
    The second quarter's production is carried out under summer climate conditions. In order to ensure the normal progress of production and create conditions for the third quarter's production, enterprises should carry out ventilation and cooling work under possible conditions according to the specific situation, pay attention to the maintenance and repair of equipment and the repair of factory buildings and dormitories, do a good job in summer labor protection and environmental sanitation, ensure the health of employees, and take necessary measures to reduce and prevent accidents, so as to achieve safe production.
    The comprehensive completion of the state's second quarter production plan is of great significance for completing and overfulfilling the annual state plan. As long as we further improve the level of management, give full play to the guarantee and supervision role of the Party, rely on the efforts of all employees, closely integrate production, supply, and sales, it is entirely possible to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the state's second quarter production plan and the annual production plan. Let us strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the state's second quarter production plan!

    加强产、供、销的结合
    完成第二季度生产计划
    一九五四年第一季度国营工业企业生产计划，在国家过渡时期总任务的鼓舞下，由于全体职工的努力，生产前作了比较充分的准备和采取了一些必要的具体措施，党委进行了有力的保证和监督，工会和青年团在职工中进行了许多具体工作，加上各企业之间加强了彼此的协作，因而基本上改变了过去年初松，一、二月份生产情况不好的现象，完成并超额完成了国家计划。根据国家统计局统计，中央六个工业部第一季度生产总值完成季度计划的百分之一百零五点一，较一九五三年第一季度增长百分之三十二点二，约完成全年计划的百分之二十三左右。第一季度国家生产计划的超额完成及其生产情况的良好，这就为完成第二季度和全年国家生产计划创造了有利条件。
    一九五四年第二季度国家对国营工业企业总的要求是：在第一季度生产的基础上，进一步提高企业管理水平，在保证质量、产品有销路和原材料供应有保证的情况下，除个别部门外，生产总值一般的应完成全年计划的百分之二十五左右，并争取能完成百分之二十七左右。这就是说，第二季度加上第一季度的生产，应该达到全年国家计划的百分之四十八，争取达到全年计划的百分之五十左右，同时还必须相应地完成劳动、财务、成本、技术组织措施计划。
    为了全面完成和超额完成第二季度国家生产计划，自然需要尽极大的努力，需要做许多复杂的具体工作，需要克服许多困难，而其中一个比较重要必须特别注意的问题，就是产、供、销的结合问题。因此在第二季度注意和解决产、供、销的结合问题，就成为经济部门全面完成和超额完成国家计划的关键之一。
    无论过去和现在，各国营工业部门和各国民经济部门，在产、供、销的结合上是尽了很大努力，作了许多复杂工作的，因而除个别部门外，基本上使产、供、销保持了平衡，保证了国家建设和人民生产、生活的需要，促进了国民经济的发展，保证了国营工业健康地并以相当高的发展速度前进。但是，在产、供、销的结合上并不是没有缺陷的。某些工业生产主管部门在编制第一季度生产计划时没有很好地研究供、销情况；某些需要部门没有及早地向生产部门提出订货；某些供应部门没有按照生产计划和基本建设计划制订原材料供应计划，因而有的工业部门就出现了产、供、销的某些不平衡现象，造成一些工业生产部门的生产困难和资金周转困难。产生这一现象的原因，主要是各企业部门对经济活动的情况研究不够，对国家和市场的需要及其变化掌握不够，组织的不好，以及某些部门在去年第四季度为今年第一季度生产进行准备工作时，对今年第一季度的情况估计不足，没有根据产、供、销的情况，按照各个不同企业的具体情况提出不同的生产要求。今后，必须认真地切实地了解研究分析经济情况，加强生产、供应、销售部门之间的联系，把生产、供应、销售工作做好，推动生产的正常发展。
    产、供、销是一个统一的整体，只有把这三方面结合起来，才能使国民经济正常发展。不仅国营工业就是地方工业也必须注意产、供、销的结合，各地区应该根据国家总的平衡，很好地组织地区平衡。产、供、销结合的关键，是加强产、供、销的计划性，是加强产、供、销部门互相帮助，密切协作。
    在生产部门，必须根据国家建设和人民的需要以及原材料情况编制生产计划，并把生产计划送给有关的供应部门和销售部门，以便它们据以拟定供应、销售计划，使生产计划有可靠的依据。我国的工业是以国内市场为基础的，不了解国家和人民的需要，不了解国内市场情况，不把生产和供、销联系起来，那就不可能准确地去组织有计划的生产，甚至还可能使生产导致不良的结果，造成国家财富的浪费。为了满足整个社会需要，在生产质量稳定和供、销有保证的条件下，必须进一步发掘企业的潜在力量，增加生产。由于国家建设和人民需要的增长，某些产品在品种与质量上已不能满足需要，因此，我们的国营工业企业，必须不断地提高技术水平，提高产品质量，有计划地生产更多的新的品种。某些国营工业部门第二季度的新产品试制任务是相当艰巨的，必须克服困难，勇敢地、坚决而又稳步地去完成新产品试制计划。为此，必须迅速地建立和充实产品设计机构，调配、培养产品设计干部，并加强国营工业部门相互之间的生产协作。凡经过试制，在技术、原材料、质量确实有把握时即可先组织小批生产，再根据需要组织大量生产。
    由于国家建设和生产的发展，原材料供应工作已日益重要，供应部门担负的任务也日益繁重，为了使供应工作更好地保证基本建设和生产的需要，因此供应部门必须按照基本建设计划和生产计划制订自己的供应计划，并切实进行原材料供应的计划管理。为了保证供应，避免浪费，供应部门应根据需要与可能进行统一采购。采购必须根据生产和基本建设的需要，合乎品种、规格、质量要求。在采购时一般的应注意：凡本部门有的，不应向别的部门采购；凡国家调拨的，不应向市场采购；凡本地有的，不应向外地采购；凡国内有的，不应向国外订购。在原材料供应方面一个极重要的问题，就是严格实行原材料的节约制度。节约是社会主义积累的重要泉源，节约原材料在经济上更有重要的意义，因为原材料是构成产品成本的主要因素，许多企业部门原材料占成本的百分之七十到八十，有的甚至占百分之八十以上。节约原材料将大大的节约国家的资源，将大大的降低生产成本，从而为国家积累更多的资金。节约原材料的主要方法是切实建立原材料消耗的原始记录，按照消耗定额限额发料，并在不影响产品质量的情况下不断的降低原材料消耗定额；在限额发料的同时，还应坚决贯彻退料制度，多余的材料必须一律退回。认真地清理仓库和处理呆滞材料，是发掘原材料潜力的重要方法，各企业部门应该组织力量切实进行这一工作。在清理过程中应该建立和健全仓库管理制度并切实规定合理的储备。鉴于第二季度某些原材料可能不足，因此供应部门必须尽最大努力满足生产需要，完成供应计划，凡原材料不足的，应积极寻找来源，能用代用品的应发动职工、技术人员积极寻找代用品，并切实建立重要物资的废料回收制度。
    销售工作在有计划的生产和有计划的分配上起着重要作用。有计划的销售是加速生产发展的主要工具之一，因为社会主义性质的国营工业生产是按照需要而生产的，如果生产单位不知道产品的需要，那就不可避免的形成盲目生产。在目前要完全摸清需要自然是困难的，但我们的销售部门必须努力逐步作到这一点。销售部门必须努力为生产部门和需要部门服务，并使生产和需要很好的结合起来。目前为结合生产和需要应开好订货会议，订立订货合同。需要部门和生产部门签订订货合同以后，销售部门应加强督促检查，使双方切实履行合同，生产部门必须根据订货合同按期完成产品品种规格及时交货，订货部门应及时提货付款，不履行合同者，应赔偿对方的经济损失。第一季度许多销售部门已经组织了订货会议，在产、销结合上起了相当作用，在第二季度应督促各部门认真履行合同，努力使第二季度在产、销上达到平衡，避免产、销脱节，并有计划地组织今年下半年的订货。为了促进我国工业的发展，销售部门应该实行有计划的销售，应该了解我国工业，特别是国营工业的生产能力，应该认真地参加与审查国外订货，凡国内工业在生产技术、原材料供应确实有把握能够生产并能够按时供应的产品，应尽量争取在国内订货。
    为了加强产、供、销的结合，各部门的干部还必须切实了解经济情况，加强政治学习，钻研业务，积极学习苏联先进经验，不懈地提高自己的政治、业务水平。由于供、销工作在目前比较薄弱，因此各主管部门应适当的充实供销机构，调配必要干部，并迅速地建立供、销分支机构。无论生产、供应和销售工作都是重要的，不可缺少的。那种只重视生产而忽视供、销工作的想法是错误的。
    在使产、供、销密切结合中，运输起着重要作用。生产和供销部门必须及时地向运输部门提出运输计划，以便运输部门分别缓急，有计划地合理地准确地完成产品、原材料的输送任务。生产和供销部门应在统一计划下尽量作到就地取材，以逐步减少和避免远途运输和相向运输的现象。
    第二季度生产是在夏季气候条件下进行的，为保证生产的正常进行，并为第三季度生产创造条件，各企业应根据具体情况在可能条件下进行通风、降温工作，注意设备的维护检修与厂房、宿舍的修缮，作好夏季劳动保护和环境卫生，保证职工的健康，并采取必要措施减少并防止事故的发生，作到安全生产。
    全面的完成国家第二季度生产计划对完成和超额完成全年国家计划有重大意义。只要我们进一步提高管理水平，发挥党的保证监督作用，依靠全体职工的努力，密切地使产、供、销结合起来，全面完成和超额完成国家第二季度生产计划和全年生产计划是完全可能的。让我们为全面完成和超额完成国家第二季度生产计划而努力！
