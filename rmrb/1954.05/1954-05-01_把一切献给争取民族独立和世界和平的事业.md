    Dedicate Everything to the Cause of National Independence and World Peace
    Ruan Huang, Worker of the Ordnance Factory in the Fifth Interzone of Vietnam, National Labor Model of Vietnam
    The Indochina War, which was imposed on the Vietnamese people by the French colonialists and has dragged on for seven or eight years, has recently become increasingly fierce due to the blatant intervention of American imperialism. All patriotic Vietnamese workers express immense anger at the American ruling clique's attempts to continue and expand the Indochina War and their deliberate sabotage of the Geneva Conference.
    I am a worker from a poor peasant background, and I deeply understand the value of freedom and happiness. I am determined not to let the aggressors' snouts reach into our happy homeland. I worked for landlords from the age of eight, enduring beatings, hunger, and cold. At sixteen, I fled to the city to work as an apprentice in a machine factory; I worked as a rubber plantation worker for French capitalists; I worked as a factory worker. For fifteen long years, I lived a miserable life of humiliation and damage like a slave. It was not until the victory of the August Revolution in 1945 that Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Party rescued me from the darkness, allowing me to see the light of day, live a life of warmth and sustenance, and become my own master.
    In order to better dedicate all my energy to the arduous cause of defending national independence and world peace, I gloriously joined the Party in the winter of 1945. After that, I worked even more actively and selflessly to repay the Party and the people for their kindness in educating me.
    In 1946, I took on the task of repairing transportation vehicles for the front lines. Initially, only two vehicles were operational. Given the urgent need for military transportation at the front, after working day and night with my fellow workers, we added three more transportation vehicles to carry ammunition and food to support the front lines. Whenever we encountered difficulties in our work or in combat, we would think of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's teachings: "Our resistance war is long-term and arduous, but we will surely achieve final victory." Then we would throw ourselves into battle with confidence in victory.
    In 1948, due to work needs, I was assigned to manage a generator in an ordnance factory. To ensure that ammunition production would not be interrupted, I cherished the machine as if it were my own life. At that time, due to the enemy's blockade, our raw materials and supplies were extremely scarce. Even the smallest machine parts had to be created by racking our brains. On one occasion, when the magneto malfunctioned, I replaced the "bakelite" with buffalo horn and used refined mixed silver to replace the worn-out platinum screws. Repairing and inspecting every small part of the machine during work breaks, Sundays, and working hours to prevent accidents has become my routine work. Therefore, for five whole years, this old, outdated generator never malfunctioned, thereby ensuring the completion of the ammunition production tasks assigned by the higher authorities. In addition, I tirelessly searched for tricks to save an average of three liters of engine oil per month. At the same time, I used my rest time to collect discarded old equipment and repaired two magnetos for the factory. Under the leadership of the Party branch and the trade union, my generator team became a model team in the factory. Because our generator team's work was rationally scheduled and constantly improved technically, we were able to transfer four fellow workers to the front lines to repair guns and military vehicles for the People's Army.
    I was originally illiterate, but since participating in revolutionary work, I have insisted on studying culture and now have a primary school education. In order to further improve my technical level, I also learn from my colleagues. Whenever I have free time at work, I help local compatriots with farming, catching mice, and exterminating insects. In 1949 and 1950, I was elected as a factory model by the workers, brothers, and sisters in the factory. In 1951, I was commended by the Fifth Interzone. In 1952, I was selected as a national industrial labor model at the National Industrial Competition Summary Conference held by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor. The most glorious and happiest thing in my life is that I was awarded a certificate of merit by Chairman Ho Chi Minh. I also received a "Labor Model" banner from the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and a Third-Class Soldier Medal from the headquarters of the People's Army of the Fifth Interzone.
    My small achievements are only a drop in the ocean of the great achievements of the entire Vietnamese working class in building the motherland. For example, in the Wu Jiaqian patriotic competition movement in 1952, many outstanding workers created new records. In 1953, one thousand labor models emerged, creating and inventing ten thousand items. These facts show the efforts made by the Vietnamese working class in defending national independence and world peace. As is well known, the cause of defending national independence is inseparable from maintaining world peace. The Vietnamese people are not only brave in fighting the imperialist aggressors, but also deeply love peace. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's statement in November 1953 in response to questions from a reporter from the Swedish "Expressen" and the Vietnamese people's delegations' participation in various international peace activities over the years fully demonstrate the sincerity and desire of the Vietnamese people for the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    However, the American warmongering clique does not want peace and fears peace. On the eve of the Geneva Conference, it has carried out a series of aggressive actions in the Asia-Pacific region, deliberately obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochina issues, and plotting to sabotage the Geneva Conference. However, these tricks of the war traffickers cannot see the light of day. In the face of the Soviet Union and China, these two great and strong fortresses of peace, and under the powerful force of the world's peace-loving people, the war instigators will surely suffer the consequences of their own actions. The liberation movement of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples will surely succeed, and the cause of world peace will surely triumph. The brilliant achievements that the great Chinese working class has achieved in the process of socialist construction are an advanced banner for the Vietnamese working class. The Vietnamese working class is determined to learn from their example and advance alongside them on the road of peaceful construction. (Attached picture)

    把一切献给争取民族独立和世界和平的事业
    越南第五联区军械厂工人  越南全国劳动模范  阮　黄
    由法国殖民者强加在越南人民身上的、一直拖延了七八年的印度支那战争，最近由于美帝国主义狂妄的干预而愈趋于激烈。所有爱国的越南工人，对美国统治集团企图继续和扩大印度支那战争、蓄意破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋，表示无比愤怒。
    我是个贫农出身的工人，深深体会到自由和幸福的可贵，我坚决不让侵略者的猪嘴伸进我们幸福的家园里来。我从八岁时就给地主做工，备受鞭笞、饥寒的苦楚；十六岁逃亡到城市的机器厂当学徒；做过法国资本家的橡胶园的工人；当过工厂工人。十五年的长时间，我过着奴隶般的被侮辱和被损害的悲惨生活。一直到一九四五年八月革命胜利后，胡志明主席和党把我从黑暗中拯救出来，使我得见天日，过着温饱的日子，做了自己的主人。
    为了更好地把我毕生的全部精力贡献给捍卫民族独立和世界和平的艰巨事业，我于一九四五年冬光荣地入了党。这之后，我就更积极地忘我工作着，借以报答党和人民教养我的恩德。
    一九四六年我担负起给前线修理运输汽车的工作。开始时只有两辆汽车可以行驶，鉴于前线军运的迫切需要，经我和工人兄弟们不分日夜地工作，随后又添了三辆运输汽车可供载运军火、粮食去支援前线。每当我们在工作中或战斗中碰到困难的时候，我们一想起胡志明主席的教导：“我们的抗战是长期的、艰苦的，但一定取得最后胜利”时，我们就会满怀胜利信心地投入战斗。
      一九四八年，由于工作的需要，我被委派在一个军械厂管理发电机。为了保证军火生产不致中断，我像爱护我的生命一样地来爱护机器。那时候由于敌人的封锁，我们的原料和物资都极缺乏，连最小的机器零件都要绞尽脑汁自己创制出来。某次磁电机发生障碍，我就以牛角代替“电木”，并以制炼的混合银代替被耗损的白金螺丝钉。利用工余、星期日和上班时间修理、检验机器中的每个细小部分以预防发生事故，已成为我经常性的工作。因此整整五年时间，这部陈旧的、逾龄的发电机从未发生故障，从而保证完成了上级交下来的军火生产任务。此外我还不倦地寻找窍门，使每月平均可以节省三公升的机油。同时我还利用休息时间搜集被废弃的旧器材，给厂中修好两部磁电机。由于党支部和工会的领导，我的发电机组成为厂中一个竞赛模范组。我们这个发电机组因为工作上调度合理，加以不断地改进技术，因而能抽调出四个工人兄弟去前线给人民军修理枪械和军用车辆。
    我本是一个文盲，自从参加革命工作后，坚持学习文化，现在已有高小的文化程度了。为了进一步提高技术水平，我并向同业们学习。工作一有空闲，我就帮助当地同胞耕种、捕鼠、灭虫。一九四九年和一九五○年度我都被厂中的工人兄弟姊妹们推选为全厂模范。一九五一年荣获第五联区表扬，一九五二年，在越南总工会召开的全国工业竞赛总结会议上被评选为全国工业劳动模范。我一生最光荣和最幸福的事，就是我荣获胡志明主席颁发的奖状。我还获得越南总工会奖给的“劳动模范”锦旗一面和第五联区人民军司令部奖给的第三级战士勋章一枚。
    我的微小的成绩，在整个越南工人阶级建设祖国的伟大业绩中，只不过是大海中的一滴水而已。例如在一九五二年的吴嘉嵌爱国竞赛运动中，就有不少优秀工人创造了新纪录。在一九五三年就涌现出一千名劳动模范，创造和发明达一万件。这些事实说明越南工人阶级在捍卫民族独立和世界和平的事业中所作的努力。如所周知，捍卫民族独立与维护世界和平的事业是不可分割的。越南人民不但勇于打击帝国主义侵略者，而且也是酷爱和平的。一九五三年十一月胡志明主席答瑞典“快报”记者问的声明和历年来越南人民代表团参加各种国际性的和平活动，都充分地表现了越南人民对恢复印度支那和平是寄予多么恳切的诚意和愿望。
    但美国好战集团却不愿和平、害怕和平，在日内瓦会议前夕，竟在亚洲及太平洋区域内进行一系列侵略行动，蓄意阻挠朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的和平解决，阴谋破坏日内瓦会议。可是战争贩子们的这些鬼蜮技俩是见不得阳光的。在苏联、中国这两个伟大的坚强的和平堡垒面前，在世界爱好和平人民强大的威力下，战争挑拨者一定会自食其恶果的。殖民地半殖民地人民的解放运动一定成功，世界和平事业一定胜利。伟大的中国工人阶级在进行社会主义建设过程中已取得的光辉成就，是越南工人阶级的一面先进的旗帜。越南工人阶级决心学习他们的范例，和他们并肩在和平建设的大路上一同迈进。（附图片）
