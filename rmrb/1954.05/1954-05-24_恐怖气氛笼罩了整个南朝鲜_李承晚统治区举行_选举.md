    Terror Pervades South Korea
    "Elections" Held in Syngman Rhee's Reign
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The puppet "National Assembly elections" in South Korea were held on the 20th under so-called United Nations supervision. An Associated Press dispatch from Busan on the 19th stated: "Brutality and accusations of assassination and intimidation marked the eve of the National Assembly elections here in South Korea."
    In recent days, an atmosphere of terror has pervaded the entire southern Korea. The police under Syngman Rhee's control are, as usual, the masters of the "elections." On the 17th, Kim Chang-heung, Syngman Rhee's "Director of Public Security," announced that "special emergency measures" would be implemented throughout South Korea from the 19th to the 21st. Under these measures, a large number of armed military police and violent organizations blockaded all cities and rural areas in South Korea, and light and heavy machine guns were deployed around the "election sites."
    The "election campaign" was conducted under the threat of police batons and bayonets. It goes without saying that voters had no democratic freedom, and "candidates" not affiliated with the Syngman Rhee faction were also subjected to repression everywhere. Many "candidates" have been arrested, including former "National Assembly" Speaker Shin Ik-hee; others were forced to withdraw from the "election" due to police interference, including Cho Bong-am, who ran against Syngman Rhee for president two years ago. Acts of violence and assassination occurred frequently. A person campaigning for former "Acting Prime Minister" Heo Jeong was arrested by the police on the 12th for "violating curfew rules" and died shortly thereafter from a blow to the head.
    After the South Korean "National Assembly elections" directed by the United States, the Associated Press reported that Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party" forcibly seized 109 of the total 203 seats. The Associated Press admitted that the "Liberal Party" achieved this result "amid frequent accusations by opposition parties that the police interfered with and intimidated voters during the campaign."
    The so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," which supervised the "elections," is preparing to compile a report describing the "free atmosphere" of the South Korean "elections." However, facts of terror and fascism continue to emerge. The Associated Press reported that plainclothes police and secret agents appeared at polling places, and the opposition accused them of threatening voters, saying they "must vote for the Liberal Party candidates personally selected by President Syngman Rhee, otherwise, when the ballot boxes are opened, it will be known who voted for whom." On election day, a large number of U.S. military police were also dispatched, and patrol cars carrying U.S. military police and Syngman Rhee's police paraded on major urban thoroughfares as a show of force. This is enough to illustrate what the so-called "free elections" under United Nations supervision, repeatedly touted by the United States, are all about.

### 恐怖气氛笼罩了整个南朝鲜  李承晚统治区举行“选举”

    恐怖气氛笼罩了整个南朝鲜
    李承晚统治区举行“选举”
    据新华社讯：南朝鲜伪“国会选举”二十日在所谓联合国监督下举行。合众社十九日自釜山发出的消息说：“暴行和对暗杀与恐吓的指责成为这里南朝鲜国会选举的前夕的标志。”
    最近几天来，恐怖气氛笼罩了整个南部朝鲜。李承晚控制下的警察照例是“选举”的主宰。十七日，李承晚的“治安局长”金长兴宣布，从十九日到二十一日，南朝鲜各地实施“特别紧急措施”。根据这种措施，大批武装军警和暴力组织封锁着南朝鲜所有的城市和农村，“选举场”周围还配备着轻、重机关枪。
    “竞选运动”是在警棍和刺刀下进行的。不用说选民毫无民主自由之可言，非李承晚派系的“候选人”也到处遭受镇压。不少“候选人”已被逮捕，包括前“国会”议长申翼熙在内；还有一些
  “候选人”在警察的干涉下被迫退出“竞选”，包括曾在两年前和李承晚竞选总统的曹奉岩。暴行和暗杀事件层出不穷。一个替前“代理国务总理”许政进行“竞选”的人，在十二日因“破坏戒严规则”被警察逮捕，不久之后就因头部被击而死。
    美国导演的南朝鲜“国会选举”结束后，据美联社报道，李承晚的“自由党”在全部二百零三个议席中强取了一百零九席。美联社承认，“自由党”是“在反对党派在竞选时经常指责警察对选民进行干涉和恫吓的情况下”取得这个选举结果的。
    监督“选举”的所谓“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”正准备编制报告，说明南朝鲜这次“选举”的“自由气氛”。但是，恐怖和法西斯的事实依然续有传出。合众社报道，便衣警察和特务出现在投票场所，反对派指责说，他们威胁选民“必须投票选举李承晚总统亲自选定的自由党候选人，不然，当打开票箱时，就会知道谁投了谁的票”。在选举那一天，美军宪兵也大批出动，载有美军宪兵和李承晚警察的巡逻车在各城市交通要道排列示威。这就足以说明美国一再鼓吹的所谓联合国监督下的“自由选举”是什么一会事。
