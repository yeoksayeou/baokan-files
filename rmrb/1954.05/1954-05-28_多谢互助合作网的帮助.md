	Why Withdraw from the Cooperative?

	In February 1953, 32 households of the Xiage Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang, Shanxi, requested to withdraw from the cooperative. This cooperative had a total of 60 households and was established after the summer harvest of 1952. It had only been half a year until February 1953, and the harvest had not yet been distributed. No one dared to say definitively whether the agricultural production cooperative had advantages or could increase production and income. Yet, more than half of the members wanted to withdraw. Why was this?

	Xiage Village is only ten li away from Yaoshanggou Village. In 1951, the Yaoshanggou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was successfully piloted and achieved a bumper harvest that year. The members all received a lot of grain and cotton, and every family lived a prosperous life. The farmers of Xiage Village were very envious of this. In the summer of 1952, the Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Wuxiang County organized farmers from Xiage Village to visit Yaoshanggou Village. The farmers of Xiage Village saw the black, oily autumn seedlings and the golden, high-yielding wheat fields being harvested in the agricultural production cooperative. The fact of high yield demonstrated the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative, and they also had the desire to establish a cooperative. After the summer harvest, they established an agricultural production cooperative, mainly based on the best mutual aid team in the village, led by Wei Wenkui. After the establishment of the cooperative, the enthusiasm of the members was very high. However, this enthusiasm only lasted for three months. One day in October, the cooperative management committee simply studied the matter and concentrated 21 privately owned oxen of the members in a large field, selecting six good oxen to be priced and entered into the cooperative. A members' meeting was held in the dark, and Party members "took the lead" in pricing the sheep and entering them into the cooperative, forcing the members to enter all 252 sheep at a very low price. At the same time, financial management was also very chaotic. Instead of setting up accounts by category, they recorded a piece of account for each household, putting the members' investments, labor work points, and the cooperative's dealings with the members all together. If you wanted to ask for a total number, you had to temporarily calculate it household by household. In particular, there was no fixed procedure between the accountant and the custodian; they handled things based on verbal instructions, and there were many errors. Some members' investments were not recorded in the accounts, and some members' labor days were under-recorded. In short, the accounts became a "pot of paste" that could not be distinguished. The chaotic accounts caused ideological concerns among the members, and many suspected the accountant of corruption.

	Land, cattle, sheep, and even people had joined the cooperative, but the thoughts of many members were still outside the cooperative. Most members were actively preparing to leave the cooperative, waiting for an opportunity to withdraw. At this time, the production enthusiasm of the members was generally low.

	What was the root cause of these serious problems? Just as the members reflected: "There is a problem with the leadership!" After the establishment of the cooperative in the summer of 1952, they elected Party Branch Secretary Wu Gengwang as the director of the cooperative and Wei Sanhe as the accountant. After the two of them participated in the training class for cooperative management backbone organized by the county party committee, they learned some cooperative management knowledge and methods, and they became arrogant, thinking that this was enough to run the cooperative well. Therefore, in the construction of the cooperative, they did not contact the surrounding cooperatives, did not absorb the experience of other cooperatives, and blindly acted on their own imagination. As a result, they violated the principle of voluntariness, and financial matters became very chaotic. More and more people asked to withdraw from the cooperative.

	The Director Worried

	In March 1953, under the leadership of the higher party committee, the tendency of blind advancement was corrected. Director Wu Gengwang, on behalf of the cooperative management committee, reviewed the leadership style, returned the sheep that had been forcibly entered into the cooperative to the members, and eliminated the estrangement between the cooperative management cadres and the members. In the process of correcting blind advancement, the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives was also publicized, the members were organized to study the resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on mutual aid and cooperation, the idea of disbanding was examined, and the enthusiasm of the members for running the cooperative and their production enthusiasm were aroused again. At this time, the 32 households that had requested to withdraw from the cooperative also expressed their determination to continue. In order to run the agricultural production cooperative well, everyone put forward a request to the cooperative leaders: quickly clear up the accounts and announce them to the members. Director Wu Gengwang also accepted everyone's request at that time.

	With the ideological concerns of the members resolved, everyone was happily engaged in production. However, the director and the accountant both became worried. The director, who loved to joke, rarely joked with the members at this time. Therefore, the members gossiped behind their backs: "Isn't it because of the correction of deviations? Before, he was a person who had the final say. Correcting the advancement made him review himself, and he lost face." This was not the case. Gengwang and Sanhe had made great progress in correcting blind advancement. They reviewed the impetuous style of trying to reach the sky in one step and improved their political and ideological level. However, the two of them knew that although the members' enthusiasm had risen, if the leadership was not good, everyone's enthusiasm would still decline. The most troublesome thing for them was how to clear up the pot of paste accounts, how to manage them after clearing them, and how to lead. Therefore, they became worried and distressed.

	Found a Solution

	On April 14, they received a notice: "A mutual aid and cooperation network meeting will be held at the Xiabeizhang Central Cooperative tomorrow." Gengwang attended the mutual aid and cooperation network meeting for the first time. At the meeting, the technician of the Xiabeizhang Agricultural Production Cooperative taught cotton planting techniques. After listening to the cotton planting methods of Xiabeizhang, Gengwang compared them with his own cotton planting methods and found that his methods were not good. The meeting also solved many specific problems and reviewed the effectiveness of the previous transmission.

	After the meeting, everyone else left, but Gengwang did not leave. He learned the methods and systems of labor management and financial management from the cadres of the Xiabeizhang Cooperative. Through this meeting, he deeply realized the role of the mutual aid and cooperation network and understood that he had harmed himself by shirking responsibility and refusing to attend the mutual aid and cooperation network meeting in the past, "blinding his own eyes with his own towel." After returning to the cooperative, he immediately convened the cooperative management committee and reported to everyone the gains from attending the mutual aid and cooperation network meeting. The cooperative management committee members were very happy to hear this and said: This time, we have found a solution! As long as we learn from other people's experiences, our cooperative will surely be run well. The next day, Gengwang and Sanhe went to the Xiabeizhang Agricultural Production Cooperative again to learn in detail the financial management system and accounting methods, and they rectified the financial system after returning to the cooperative. They first cleared up the accounts, reconciled them with the members, custodians, and sideline businesses, and corrected the previous errors; then, they re-established a set of systems and methods, setting up five accounts according to the nature of the accounts, which were clearly distinguished; a voucher system was also established between the accountant and the custodian; and it was stipulated that expenditures within 10,000 yuan should be approved by the director, expenditures within 50,000 yuan must be approved by the cooperative management committee, and expenditures above 50,000 yuan must be approved by the members' meeting. From then on, the accounts were gradually cleared daily and settled monthly, and statements were issued quarterly, changing the chaotic situation of unclear accounts, troubled accountants, and suspicious members in the past.

	From the director to every member, they felt that this was thanks to the mutual aid and cooperation network, and they were determined to learn from other people's experiences and run their own cooperative well. From then on, they attended the mutual aid and cooperation network meetings on the 1st and 15th of each month, and visited and consulted old cooperatives when they encountered difficult problems. The mutual aid and cooperation network has become a school for learning experience.

	Consult Old Cooperatives When There Are Problems

	After the spring plowing and sowing ended, a big problem occurred. The entire cooperative had 50 male laborers, and each person only had an average of more than 13 mu of land; even with female laborers, each person had an average of less than 10 mu of land. Therefore, the spring plowing and sowing ended quickly. The members had no work to do and asked the director for work; the team leaders asked the director to arrange livelihood; the director had no place to find work, and he became worried again. At that time, there was work to be done outside the cooperative, and many people were building houses, which required manpower. Everyone knew this, but no one wanted to do it. Because there was a provision in the cooperative: members of the agricultural production cooperative should actively work for the cooperative and are not allowed to engage in other production outside. This provision was passed by everyone, and who would be willing to violate this provision in their own name? Therefore, the members were all asking the cooperative for work, and they did not actively seek livelihood outside. It was not a good way to do it uniformly by the whole cooperative. They had contracted a house repair job once before, but because the work point recording method was not appropriate, many members were idling, resulting in more labor used, but the project was not done well. The homeowner complained that the work was poorly done, and the members also felt that it was not worthwhile and earned less money, which made the cooperative management cadres a little scared. On May 1, at the mutual aid and cooperation network meeting, this problem was raised and solved. Li Jintang, the director of the Xiabeizhang Cooperative, answered this question: "If there are more laborers and less land, you can find more production avenues and engage in some sideline production. If the whole cooperative engages in sideline production uniformly, you can take the contracting method and contract it to the labor team, so they will not idle. If everyone does not agree with the cooperative engaging in it together, it can also be done by team under the condition that it does not affect the production within the cooperative, but the cooperative must lead uniformly." With this solution, a cooperative management committee with members' representatives was convened after returning to the cooperative, allowing everyone to discuss this issue. Everyone felt that the previous provision in the cooperative that members could not engage in other production outside was somewhat wrong and did not conform to the actual situation of the cooperative, and it should be revised quickly. Finally, it was decided that labor teams would contract house repair projects under unified leadership to solve the problem of having no work to do. This decision was supported by the members, and five labor teams contracted seven house repair projects, contracted a total of 300 workdays, and earned more than 2.2 million yuan in wages. Since then, during the slack farming season, oil pressing, contracting house repairs, etc., have generated more than 6 million yuan in income, resolving the contradiction of having more laborers and less land.

	After the spring plowing and sowing ended, a problem also occurred in the calculation of work accounts. The number of workdays for each team was very different. The Wei Wanghai team averaged 67 work points per person, while the Yang Shouxiang team averaged only 45 work points per person. Because the work evaluation standards were different, the teams argued. The Wanghai team said that the Shouxiang team had fewer workdays because they did not work in the fields, and the Shouxiang team said that the Wanghai team had more workdays because they did not tightly control the work tickets. Everyone suspected each other, which affected production. The director also knew that there was a problem with the work recording, but there was no way to solve it. It happened that Wang Jinyun, the director of the Yaoshanggou Cooperative, passed through Xiage Village on his way home from a meeting in Changzhi, and the director invited Wang Jinyun to stay and help solve the problem. With Wang Jinyun's help and guidance, each team cross-checked the quality of the work done in the fields. After the inspection, a life review meeting was held. The Wei Wanghai team reviewed the error of not strictly controlling the work tickets, and the Yang Shouxiang team reviewed the shortcoming of having fewer workdays in the fields. The teams resolved their suspicions and improved the method of issuing work tickets. Later, at the county mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, they also learned the method of the Jianzhang Cooperative and further improved the work recording system.

	After participating in the mutual aid and cooperation network, they learned many advanced experiences. However, some cooperative management cadres therefore developed a dependence mentality and did not actively think of ways to solve their own problems, wanting to completely rely on the mutual aid and cooperation network. This dependence mentality did not change until they hit a snag. In the summer of 1953, a cooperative management committee was convened to study the work evaluation method and the division of wheat land. Everyone knew that the number of workdays that should be used for one mu of wheat land from planting to harvesting could be calculated after careful calculation, but no one wanted to use their brains. They only cared about smoking, and the whole room was filled with smoke that was about to make it impossible to open their eyes, but still no one spoke. Later, Wei Laifa, the vice director who was willing to speak, put forward his opinion: "Go to Xiabeizhang to see how many workdays they use, and we will use the same number. Why bother with this brainpower!" The land of the two cooperatives, whether scattered or integrated, the amount of fertilizer applied was different, so how could the number of workdays be the same? As a result, after visiting the Xiabeizhang Cooperative and knowing their number of workdays, it still could not be used. Finally, after detailed calculations, the number of workdays was determined.

	In the process of learning experience, a problem also occurred: some members had a serious conservative mentality and were not easy to accept new things. For example, some old men did not agree with the promotion of small contracting. They said: "Small contracting is to rush some work. However, it will also delay some work when contracting, and the difference will not be much after offsetting it, and you will have to suffer some trouble." After a typical experiment in the Wei Wanghai team, everyone saw that small contracting was indeed good before it was promoted to the whole cooperative.

	Thanks to the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Network

	"To tell the truth, the success of our cooperative is thanks to the mutual aid and cooperation network." This was a heartfelt remark made by a member at the celebration meeting for the bumper harvest in 1953. Through the mutual aid and cooperation network, they learned 14 kinds of advanced experiences from cooperatives such as Yaoshanggou and Xiabeizhang, including political and ideological leadership, accounting system, cattle feeding, and integration of agriculture and sideline businesses. It was these experiences that enabled this agricultural cooperative to be consolidated and improved step by step, ensuring the bumper harvest of 1953. The entire cooperative had a total of 650 mu of land, and the average yield of grain per mu in the summer and autumn seasons was 252 jin, which was 28 jin more than the mutual aid teams in the village and 16 percent more than the yield per household in the cooperative in 1952. In particular, cotton, after learning the cotton planting technology of the Xiabeizhang Cooperative, the average yield of seed cotton per mu was 110 jin, which was an increase of 120 percent over 1952.

	Now, this agricultural production cooperative has changed from a backward cooperative to an advanced cooperative. The Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Wuxiang County has identified this cooperative as a central cooperative of a mutual aid and cooperation network, leading the new cooperatives in the surrounding four villages, such as Xilao. This spring, this mutual aid and cooperation network has been active three times, transmitting methods such as land entry into the cooperative for evaluation and cattle valuation to the new cooperatives, helping the four new cooperatives to do a good job in the initial construction work of the cooperative, and also teaching cotton planting techniques, eliminating the ideological concerns of the new cooperatives that they lack technology and dare not plant cotton, and responding to the call of the country, expanding the cotton fields by a total of 278 mu.

    为什么要退社？
    一九五三年二月，山西武乡下合村农业生产合作社有三十二户社员提出退社的要求。这个社总共六十户，是一九五二年夏收以后建立的，到一九五三年二月才短短的半年，还没有分配收获物，农业生产合作社有没有优越性，能不能增产增加收入，谁还不敢说句肯定话，却有一半多社员要退社，这是因为什么呢？
    下合村离窑上沟村平平的十里路。一九五一年，窑上沟村农业生产合作社试办成功，当年获得了丰收，社员们都分到了很多的粮食、棉花，家家过着富裕的生活。下合村的农民对这很羡慕。一九五二年夏季，中共武乡县第二区委会又组织下合村农民到窑上沟村参观。下合村农民看到了农业生产合作社里的一块接一块的黑油油的秋苗和正在收获着的金黄色的丰产麦田。丰产的事实说明了农业生产合作社的优越性，他们也有了办社的要求。夏收以后，就以本村最好的魏文魁互助组为主，建立了一个农业生产合作社。建社以后，社员们的热情很高。但是，这种积极性只坚持了三个月。十月的一天，只是由社务干部简单地研究了一下，就把社员的二十一头私有耕牛集中到一个大场上，挑选了六头好牛作价入了社。黑夜又召开了社员大会，由党员“带头”把羊群作价入社，强迫社员们把二百五十二只羊作了很低的价钱全部入了社。同时，财务管理上也十分混乱。他们不是分类立账，而是一户记一片儿账，把社员的投资、劳动工分、社和社员间的往来全部记在一块儿。要问一个总数字，还得临时一户一户合算。尤其是会计和保管间没有一定手续，凭话办事，差错很多。有的社员的投资没记上账，有的社员的劳动日少记了。总之，账目成了什么也分不清的“浆糊盆”。混乱的账目，引起了社员的思想顾虑，很多人怀疑会计有贪污行为。
    土地、牛、羊连上人都入社了，但是许多社员的思想却还是留在社外，大部分社员积极地作着出社的准备，等候机会出社。这时，社员的生产情绪普遍低落了。
    发生这些严重问题的根源在那里呢？正像社员们反映的：“领导有问题！”一九五二年夏季建社以后，选举党支部书记吴更旺做社长，魏三和任会计。他两个人参加了县委举办的办社骨干训练班以后，学习了一些办社知识和方法，就自高自大起来了，以为这就满可以把社办好。因此，他们在建社中再没有和周围的社联系，没有吸取别的社的经验，只凭自己的想像盲目蛮干。结果，就违犯了自愿原则，财务上也弄得十分混乱。要求退社的人就越来越多起来。
      社长发愁了
    一九五三年三月，在上级党委领导下纠正了盲目冒进的偏向。社长吴更旺代表社务委员会检查了领导作风，把强迫入社的羊群退还给了社员，消除了社务干部和社员之间的隔阂。在纠正盲目冒进中，又宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性，组织社员学习了中共中央关于互助合作的决议，检查了散伙思想，又把社员的办社热情和生产积极性发动起来了。三十二户要求出社的社员，这时也表示要坚决办下去。大家为了办好农业生产合作社，给社务领导上提出了一个要求：快清理账目向社员公布。社长吴更旺当时也接受了大家的要求。
    解决了社员的思想顾虑，大家高高兴兴地在进行生产。可是，社长和会计两个人都发愁起来了。爱开玩笑的社长，这时也很少和社员们说笑。因此社员们背后纷纷议论：“还不是因为纠偏；以前人家是说一不二的人，纠正冒进给大家作了检讨，丢人啦。”事实不是这样的。更旺和三和在纠正盲目冒进中有了很大的进步。他们检查了一步登天的急躁作风，提高了政策思想水平。但是，他俩知道：社员们的情绪虽然是起来了，可是如果领导的不好，大家的情绪仍然会低落下去。最使他俩头痛的是一盆浆糊账如何清算，清算以后又怎样管理，怎样领导。因此，就发愁起来，苦恼起来。
      找到了办法
    四月十四日接到通知：“明天在下北漳中心社召开互助合作网会议。”更旺第一次出席了互助合作网的会议。会上由下北漳农业生产合作社的技术员传授了种棉技术。更旺听了下北漳的种棉办法，和自己的种棉办法一对照，发现自己的办法就是不好。会上还解决了不少具体问题，检查了上一次的传授效果。
    会后，别人都走了，更旺没有走。他向下北漳社的干部学习了劳动管理、财务管理的办法和制度。经过这次会议，他深深地体会到了互助合作网的作用，明白了过去借故推托不参加互助合作网会议是自己害了自己，“自己拿上手巾蒙蔽了自己的眼睛”。回社以后，他当即召开了社务委员会，给大家报告了出席互助合作网会议的收获。社务委员们听了都很乐意地说：这一下可给咱找到办法了！只要咱好好学习人家的经验，咱们的社保险能办好。第二天天明，更旺和三和两个人又到下北漳农业生产合作社详细地学习了财务管理的制度和记账办法，回社整顿了财务制度。他们首先清理了账目，和社员、保管、副业三方面进行对账清账，把以前的差错都纠正了；然后，重新建立了一套制度和办法，按性质分类立了五本账，分得一清二白的；会计和保管之间也建立了传票制度；并且规定开支一万元以内由社长批准，开支五万元以内须由社务委员会批准，五万元以上的开支要由社员大会通过。从此，账目逐渐地做到了日清月结，按季出清单，改变了过去账目不清、会计苦恼、社员怀疑的混乱局面。
    从社长到每一个社员都感到这是沾了互助合作网的光，下了决心要好好地学习人家的经验，办好自己的社。自此以后，每月一日和十五日出席互助合作网会议，遇到难解决的问题就到老社访问领教。互助合作网已成了学习经验的学校。
    有问题就向老社请教
    春耕下种结束以后发生了一个很大的问题。全社五十个男劳力，每人只平均有土地十三亩多；连上妇女劳力，每人就平均不到十亩地了。因此，春耕下种很快就结束了。社员们没有了活做，向社长要活干；组长找社长要求给安排营生；社长没处找活，就又发愁起来。那时，社外是有活做的，有许多人家正修房，需要用人，这是谁也知道的，可是没人去做。因为社内有一条规定：农业生产合作社社员要为社积极劳动，不准出外搞其他生产。这规定是大家通过的，谁肯把这个规定破坏到自己名下呢？因此，社员们都是向社要活干，不主动到外找营生。全社统一搞吧，又没有一个好办法。过去包揽过一次修房的活，因为记工办法不合适，社员们磨洋工的很多，结果是用的工多，工程可没有做好，房主嫌营生做得赖，社员也觉得不上算，挣的钱少，弄得社务干部也有些伤胆。到五月一日，互助合作网开会，把这个问题提出来，才解决了。下北漳社社长李金堂解答了这个问题：“劳力多土地少可以多找些生产门路，搞些副业生产。如果全社统一搞副业生产，可以采取包工办法，包给劳动小组，这样他们就不会磨洋工了。如果大家不同意社里大伙搞，在不影响社内生产的条件下按小组搞也可以，但社内要统一领导。”有了这个解决办法，回社召开了有社员代表参加的社务委员会，让大家讨论了这个问题。大家都感到社内以前规定的社员不能出外搞其他生产有些不对，不合乎社内的实际情况，应该很快地修改。最后决定了在统一领导下由小组包揽修房工程，解决没活干的问题。这个决定得到了社员的拥护，五个劳动小组就包揽了七家修房，共包工三百个，得工资二百二十多万元。此后，在农闲时间榨油、包工修房等等，就收入六百多万元，解决了劳力多土地少的矛盾。
    春耕下种结束后，在算工账中还发生了一个问题。算下账来，各组的工数多少相差很远。魏旺孩组每人平均六十七分工，杨守先组每人只平均四十五分工。因为评工标准不一样，各组争吵起来。旺孩组说守先组工少是没下到地里工，守先组说旺孩组工多是掌握工票不紧。大家互相猜疑，影响到生产。社长也知道这是记工上有问题，可是没办法解决。恰巧窑上沟社社长王锦云由长治开会回家路经下合村，社长就请王锦云住下帮助解决问题。在王锦云的帮助指导下，各组互相交叉上地检查了活做得好坏，检查完后召开了生活检讨会，魏旺孩组检查了掌握工票不严的错误，杨守先组检查了地里下工少的缺点，组和组之间解除了猜疑，并且改进了开工票的办法。后来在县互助合作代表会议上又学习了监漳社的办法，进一步改进了记工制度。
    参加了互助合作网以后，学习了很多先进经验。但是，有些社务干部却因此滋长了依赖思想，对本身的问题不去积极想办法解决，想完全依赖互助合作网。这种依赖思想直到碰了钉子才改变了。一九五三年夏季，有一次开社务委员会研究评工办法和分麦地。一亩麦地从种到收割该用几个工，谁都知道经过细算能算出来，可是谁也不想用脑子，只顾吸烟，满屋烟熏的快要睁不开眼了，还是没有一个人说话。后来还是肯说话的副社长魏来法提出了他的意见：“到下北漳看看人家是几个工咱也是几个工就行啦，尽管费这个脑筋干啥哩！”两个社的土地零整、上肥料多少都不同，用工那能一样呢？结果，访问了下北漳社，知道了它们的用工数后，还是不能用。最后还是经过详细计算，才评定了工数。
    在学习经验中还发生过一个问题：有些社员保守思想严重，不容易接受新东西。比如推广小包工，一部分老汉就不赞成。他们说：“小包工是赶些工。可是包的时候还要误些工，相顶下来不差多少，还得受些麻烦。”经过在魏旺孩组内典型实验后，大家看到小包工确实好，才推广到了全社。
    多谢互助合作网
      “说句良心话，咱社办好是沾了互助合作网的光。”这是一个社员在庆祝一九五三年丰产大会上说出来的一句心里话。他们通过互助合作网，学习了窑上沟、下北漳等社的政治思想领导、会计制度、耕牛喂养、农副业结合等十四种先进经验。就是这些经验，使他们这个农业社一步一步巩固和提高了，保证了一九五三年的丰收。全社共六百五十亩土地，夏秋两季每亩平均收粮二百五十二斤，比本村互助组多收了二十八斤，比一九五二年社内各户的产量多百分之十六。特别是棉花，学习了下北漳社的种棉技术，每亩就平均产了籽棉一百一十斤，比一九五二年增产了百分之一百二十。
    现在，这个农业生产合作社已经由落后社变成先进社了。中共武乡县第二区委会已经把这个社确定为一个互助合作网的中心社，带动周围西堖等四个村的新社。今春，这个互助合作网活动了三次，给新社传授了土地入社评产、耕牛作价等办法，帮助四个新社搞好了建社初期的建社工作，还传授了种棉技术，解除了新社缺技术不敢种棉的思想顾虑，响应了国家号召，共扩大棉田二百七十八亩。
