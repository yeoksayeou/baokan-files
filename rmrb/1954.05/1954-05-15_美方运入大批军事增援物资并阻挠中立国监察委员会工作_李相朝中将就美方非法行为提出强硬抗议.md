Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 14th: On April 30, 1954, the Military Armistice Commission received a report from the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission addressed to the Military Armistice Commission regarding US violations of the armistice agreement by bringing military reinforcements into Korea during the period from the armistice’s entry into force to April 15, 1954. Based on the materials that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was able to grasp under the US's repeated restrictions and obstructions, the report fully exposed the fact that the US has continuously violated the armistice agreement and transported military reinforcements in various ways since the armistice. Regarding the aforementioned exposed illegal actions of the US, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged a strong protest with the US side at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on May 13.

Based on the materials revealed in the aforementioned report, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out that since the armistice, the US has failed to comply with the provision of the armistice agreement that the replacement of combat materials can only be carried out on the basis of "one-for-one replacement of the same performance and type." Taking combat aircraft as an example, in the eight months from August 1953 to March 1954, the US successively over-shipped fifteen major types of combat aircraft used on the Korean battlefield. The US, disregarding the clear agreement of the Military Armistice Commission on the definition of combat aircraft, refused to report the entry of various types of combat aircraft that fully met the above definition into Korea. As of April 15, 1954, the number of such combat aircraft that the US secretly shipped into Korea and discovered by the Neutral Nations Inspection Team had reached as many as 177. The Neutral Nations Inspection Team also discovered that the US had entered combat aircraft in places other than designated ports, the number of which the Neutral Nations Inspection Team was unable to calculate. At the same time, the US, disregarding the provisions of the armistice agreement and the resolutions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, refused to report the large number of spare parts, disassembled parts, and components of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition that the US had transported into Korea, and refused the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to supervise and inspect them. As of the end of February 1954, the spare parts, disassembled parts, and components of combat materials shipped in by the US through designated ports and discovered by the Neutral Nations Inspection Team could be assembled into 6,400 rocket launchers, 145 mortars of various calibers, 465 howitzers and other types of guns of various calibers, and 1,365 machine guns of various calibers. On the one hand, the US broke the whole into parts when transporting combat materials, and on the other hand, it reported parts as a whole when transporting combat materials out. For example, when the US transported a mortar barrel, it claimed that it was a part, and therefore refused to be restricted by the armistice agreement. However, when the US transported out a mortar barrel, it falsely reported that it was a mortar, attempting to exchange one mortar barrel for a complete mortar. As for the examples of the US frequently reporting less when transporting combat materials out and reporting more when transporting combat materials in, there are too many to mention. In addition, in the five months from October 1953 to February 1954, the US reported that it had destroyed and consumed 130 million rounds of bullets and 1.1 million rounds of artillery shells. The US will enter the same number of bullets and artillery shells based on this, and has already entered a considerable number of bullets and artillery shells based on this. During the armistice period, it is inconceivable that the US would have destroyed and consumed such a huge amount of ammunition.

After comprehensively and concisely listing the above facts, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out that the US obviously disregarded our repeated protests and the repeated exposure by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and has continuously transported military reinforcements since the armistice. Moreover, these illegal activities are still in progress. It is precisely in order to continue to transport a large number of military reinforcements that the US is increasingly restricting, obstructing, and interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in the South, and continuously slandering and threatening the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in an attempt to undermine its existence. These practices of the US seriously violate the provisions of Article 13, Paragraph 卯, of the armistice agreement regarding the replacement of combat materials, which must be carried out on the basis of one-for-one replacement of the same performance and type, through designated ports, and under the supervision and inspection of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. The US also seriously violated the provisions of Article 13, Paragraph 午, Article 13, Paragraph 酉, Article 17, Article 42, Paragraph 寅, and Article 43 of the armistice agreement regarding both sides providing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams with the freedom, convenience, assistance, and cooperation necessary to properly perform their supervisory and inspection duties. The US also seriously violated the "Methods for Supervising and Reporting Military Personnel and Replacement Items Arriving and Leaving North Korea" agreed by the Military Armistice Commission on September 28, 1953, and the definition of combat aircraft agreed on November 28, 1953.

General Li Xiangchao further pointed out that the US's serious violation of the armistice agreement and the agreements between the two sides of the Military Armistice Commission, continuing to transport a large number of military reinforcements, and repeatedly restricting and obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its teams, and even conspiring to undermine the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, are inseparable from the US's having equipped four new South Korean divisions since the armistice and the US military and political authorities' recent plans to step up the further large-scale expansion of the South Korean army, navy, and air force. Its purpose is clearly to expand military forces, maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, and deliberately create tension in an attempt to undermine the Geneva Conference and obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao finally solemnly pointed out that strict compliance with the armistice agreement is an obligation that neither party can evade. The US must immediately stop transporting any military reinforcements from outside Korea in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement, and stop all illegal activities that interfere with, obstruct, and attempt to undermine the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The US shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from these illegal actions of the US.

    美方运入大批军事增援物资并阻挠中立国监察委员会工作
    李相朝中将就美方非法行为提出强硬抗议
    【新华社开城十四日电】军事停战委员会在一九五四年四月三十日，收到了中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员署名向军事停战委员会提出的关于自停战生效至一九五四年四月十五日期间美方违反停战协定、以军事增援运入朝鲜的报告。该报告以中立国监察委员会在美方百般限制与阻挠之下所仅能掌握的材料，充分揭发了美方自停战以来不断违反停战协定、以各种方式运进军事增援的事实。对于美方上述被揭露的非法行为，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在五月十三日的军事停战委员会会议上向美方提出强硬抗议。
    李相朝中将根据上述报告中所揭发的材料指出：美方自停战以来就不按照停战协定中关于作战物资的替换只能在“同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行”的规定，以作战飞机为例，自一九五三年八月至一九五四年三月的八个月中，美方就先后超额运进了十五种朝鲜战场上所使用的、主要类型的作战飞机，美方又不顾军事停战委员会关于作战飞机定义的明确协议，拒绝报告多种类型的完全符合上述定义的作战飞机进入朝鲜，截至一九五四年四月十五日止，为中立国视察小组所发现的，美方私自运进朝鲜的此等作战飞机的数目已达一百七十七架之多。中立国视察小组并已发现美方在特定口岸以外的地方进入作战飞机，其数目是中立国视察小组无法计算的。与此同时，美方还不顾停战协定的规定和中立国监察委员会的决议，拒绝报告该方运进朝鲜的大量作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的散件、拆散件与零件，拒绝中立国监察委员会对此进行监督与视察。截至一九五四年二月底止，仅仅是美方经由特定口岸运入而为中立国视察小组所发现的作战物资的散件、拆散件与零件就可以装配成火箭炮六千四百门，各种口径的迫击炮一百四十五门，各种口径的榴弹炮及其他类型的炮四百六十五门，以及各种口径的机关枪一千三百六十五挺。而美方一方面在运入作战物资时化整为零，另一方面又在运出作战物资时以零报整。例如：美方在运进一个迫击炮炮筒时就声称这是一个零件，因而拒受停战协定的限制。但当美方运出一个迫击炮炮筒时却又谎报称这是一门迫击炮，企图以运出一个迫击炮炮筒来换进一门完整的迫击炮。至于美方经常在运出作战物资时以少报多，运入作战物资时以多报少的例子则不胜枚举。此外，美方自一九五三年十月至一九五四年二月的五个月中，曾报告称该方毁坏耗损了一亿三千万发枪弹，一百一十万发炮弹，美方将据此进入同等数量的枪弹和炮弹，并且已经据此进入了相当数量的枪弹与炮弹。在停战期间，美方毁坏耗损的弹药数量会如此巨大实在是不可思议的。
    李相朝中将在全面扼要地列举上述种种事实后指出：美方显然是不顾我方的多次抗议与中立国监察委员会的一再揭发，自停战以来不断地运进军事增援。而且此等非法行为仍继续进行中，美方也正就是为了要继续大量运进军事增援，才如此日益加甚地限制阻挠与干涉在南方的中立国视察小组的工作，并接连不断地对中立国监察委员会进行诽谤与威胁，以图破坏其存在。美方这种种做法，严重违反了停战协定第十三款卯项关于作战物资的替换，必须在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上，经由指定的口岸在中立国视察小组的监督与视察下进行的规定。美方也严重违反了停战协定第十三款午项、第十三款酉项、第十七款、第四十二款寅项及第四十三款关于双方应给予中立国监察委员会及其视察小组以适当执行其监督与视察的职司所必需的自由、便利、协助与合作的各项规定。美方还严重违反了军事停战委员会一九五三年九月二十八日所协议的“关于监督与报告到达与离开朝鲜的军事人员与替换物件的办法”及一九五三年十一月二十八日所协议的关于作战飞机的定义。
    李相朝将军进一步指出：美方此种严重违反停战协定以及军事停战委员会双方间的协议，继续运进大量军事增援，百般限制阻挠中立国监察委员会及其小组的工作，乃至阴谋破坏中立国监察委员会的存在，是和美方自停战以来，已装备了四个南朝鲜新师以及美方军政当局最近在加紧筹划的进一步大规模扩充南朝鲜海陆空军的计划分不开的。其目的显然是要扩大军事力量，保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，并蓄意制造紧张局势，企图破坏日内瓦会议，借以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    李相朝中将最后严正指出：严格遵守停战协定是任何一方所不能逃避的义务，美方必须立即按照停战协定的规定，停止自朝鲜境外运入任何军事增援，停止干涉、阻挠并企图破坏中立国监察委员会的存在的一切非法行为。由于美方此等非法行为所产生的一切后果，应由美方完全承担。
