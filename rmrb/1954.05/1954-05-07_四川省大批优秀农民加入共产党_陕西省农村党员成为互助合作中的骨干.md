Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 6th: Since last winter, many labor models and advanced elements among farmers in rural Sichuan Province have applied to join the Chinese Communist Party. From January to the end of March this year, more than 7,500 outstanding farmers throughout the province have been approved to join the Chinese Communist Party. After joining the Party, these outstanding farmers have become "socialist pathfinders" in the countryside, playing a core role in the movements of mutual aid and cooperation and increasing grain and cotton production. Many new Party members have taken up the positions of director and deputy director of agricultural production cooperatives. All five new Party members of the Xiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Chengdu have taken on leadership roles, and they are constantly adopting various methods to consolidate and develop the agricultural production cooperative. Party members are also setting a learning example for the masses in adopting advanced farming techniques to ensure increased production of grain, cotton, and other oil crops. Under the demonstration and promotion of new and old Party members in Huaqiao Township, Xinjin County, 90% of farmers have adopted mud-water seed selection, and new-style seedling plots have reached 90% of the area already sown.

The Communist Party Committees at all levels in Sichuan Province attach great importance to the work of developing new Party members in rural areas. This spring, training classes were held in various places to conduct communist education for more than 69,500 rural activists. At present, Party committees at all levels are continuing to develop new Party members in conjunction with various tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th: Communist Party members in the vast rural areas of Shaanxi Province have become an active backbone force in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. More than 70% of Communist Party members in the province's rural areas have participated in various types of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and 40% of the Party members have become cadres in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Most of the directors and deputy directors of the province's more than 600 agricultural production cooperatives are Communist Party members. Many leaders of mutual aid teams are also Communist Party members. Within the mutual aid and cooperative organizations, they can actively unite the surrounding farmers and steadily develop the mutual aid and cooperative organizations from small to large and from low-level to high-level.

Communist Party members can actively organize and lead farmers to improve farming techniques and strive to increase crop yields on the agricultural front. In recent years, advanced farming techniques such as deep plowing and close planting, rational fertilization, and selection of fine varieties, which have been promoted in agriculture throughout the province, have mostly been implemented first in the mutual aid teams or cooperatives led by Communist Party members. Last year, eight cooperatives in the province, led by Communist Party members, received awards for high yields because they promoted advanced farming techniques. When sowing winter wheat last autumn, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry called on farmers in wheat-producing areas to implement close-row and close-planting. Some farmers were afraid that planting too densely would prevent growth. Communist Party members actively publicized to the farmers to dispel their concerns. In addition to leading their mutual aid team to implement close-planting first, the Party members of Taiyukou Township in Tongguan County, under the leadership of the CPC branch, coordinated with the township's propagandists and Communist Youth League members to promote wheat close-planting to the farmers, and transferred more than 800 catties of fine wheat seeds to solve the difficulty of farmers lacking seeds when implementing close-planting, so that most of the wheat fields in the township were planted closely. In addition to taking the lead in implementing close planting, some Communist Party members in Chang'an County also discussed the overall improvement of farming techniques with the surrounding farmers, carried out deep plowing and fertilization before wheat sowing, and this year the wheat seedlings in Chang'an County are growing very vigorously.

In order to consolidate mutual aid and cooperative organizations, Communist Party members in various places have also universally established strict work point recording and accounting, democratic management, criticism and self-criticism, and learning systems within their own mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative led by Ma Tinghai, a Communist Party member in Dali County, there were phenomena of work stoppages and absenteeism due to unsound systems. He brought this situation to the Party group meeting for research, and in accordance with the Party's instructions, Party members first conducted self-criticism at the members' meeting, and then mobilized everyone to find the reasons and formulated a relatively sound labor system to consolidate the agricultural production cooperative. The mutual aid and cooperative organizations led by Communist Party members also pay attention to uniting and helping farmers outside the cooperative. This spring, when the mutual aid joint group of Wangmang Village in Chang'an County was upgraded to an agricultural production cooperative, several elderly farmers were unwilling to transfer to the cooperative. Communist Party members Pu Zhongzhi and Yi Jidong, based on the principle of voluntarism, helped them organize three mutual aid groups for production, and also helped them solve the difficulties of fertilizers. The farmers were very satisfied.

    四川省大批优秀农民加入共产党
    陕西省农村党员成为互助合作中的骨干
    【新华社成都六日电】去冬以来，四川省农村中许多劳动模范和农民中的先进分子纷纷申请加入中国共产党。今年一月到三月底，全省已有七千五百多个优秀农民被批准加入中国共产党。这批优秀农民入党后，已成为农村中的“社会主义带路人”，他们在互助合作和增产粮食、棉花等运动中正起着核心作用。许多新党员已担任农业生产合作社的正、副社长。成都市郊区西光农业生产合作社的五个新党员全部担任了领导工作，他们正不断地采取各种办法来巩固和发展农业生产合作社。党员在采用先进耕作技术，保证粮食、棉花和其他油料作物增产方面，也为群众树立了学习榜样。新津县花桥乡在新、老党员的示范推广下，百分之九十的农户采用了泥水选种，同时新式秧田也达到已撒秧的秧母田的百分之九十。
    中共四川省各级党委，对在农村发展新党员的工作十分重视。今年春天各地以举办训练班的方式，向六万九千五百多名农村积极分子进行了共产主义的教育。目前，各级党委正结合各项工作继续发展新党员。
    【新华社西安六日电】陕西省广大农村中的共产党员在互助合作运动中成为积极的骨干力量。全省农村中有百分之七十以上的共产党员参加了各种类型的互助合作组织，其中百分之四十的党员成为互助合作组织中的干部。全省六百多个农业生产合作社的主任和副主任，大部分由共产党员担任。很多互助组的领导成员也都是共产党员。他们在互助合作组织内，都能积极团结周围农民，把互助合作组织由小到大、由低级到高级稳步地发展起来。
    共产党员们在农业战线上都能积极组织和领导农民改进耕作技术，为提高农作物的产量而斗争。几年以来，全省在农业上所推行的深耕密植、合理施肥，选育良种等先进耕作技术，大都是在共产党员所领导的互助组或合作社内首先推行。去年全省有八个由共产党员领导的合作社，因为推行了先进耕作技术，受到了丰产的奖励。去年秋季播种冬麦时，陕西省人民政府农林厅号召产麦区农民实行密行密植，有些农民害怕种的稠了长不起来，共产党员们便积极向农民宣传，解除他们的顾虑。潼关县太峪口乡的党员除了带领他们的互助组首先推行密植外，又在中共党支部领导下，协同全乡的宣传员和青年团员向农民进行小麦密植的宣传，并在全乡调剂出优良麦种八百多斤，解决农民在实行密植时缺乏种籽的困难，使全乡大部分麦田施行了密植。长安县有些共产党员除了带头推行密植外，还和周围农民讨论了全面改进耕作技术的问题，在小麦播种前进行了深耕和施肥，今年长安县的麦苗长的就很茁壮。
    为了巩固互助合作组织，各地共产党员还普遍在自己的互助合作组织内建立了严格的记工算账、民主管理、批评和自我批评以及学习制度。大荔县共产党员马廷海领导的农业生产合作社成立后，由于制度不健全，发生窝工、旷工现象。他把这种情形提到党的小组会上研究，并遵照党的指示，首先由党员在社员大会上进行了检讨，然后发动大家找出原因，订出了比较健全的劳动制度，使农业生产合作社巩固起来。共产党员所领导的互助合作组织，还注意团结和帮助社外农民。今年春天长安县王莽村互助联组上升为农业生产合作社时，有几户老年农民不愿转社，共产党员蒲忠智和益冀东便根据自愿原则，帮助他们组织了三个互助组进行生产，同时还帮助他们解决了肥料的困难，农民们非常满意。
