After completing the task of unified grain purchase, Shangzhuang Township, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, promptly focused on meeting the needs of the masses for production and daily life, conscientiously organized the economic life of the masses, actively organized the circulation of social grain reserves, to invigorate the rural economy and promote the development of production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In January alone, the township's supply and marketing cooperative purchased 23,282 jin of grain reserves from the masses, while also supplying 4,256 jin of grain to grain-deficient households and for grain seed adjustment among the masses. It supplied 3,377 jin of raw materials to flour mills, tofu workshops, etc., and organized oil mills to process oil for the masses, solving the local people's supply of non-staple foods.

At the end of the unified grain purchase in the township, due to the incomplete and insufficient implementation of the policy of mutual exchange among the masses, many ideological concerns arose among the masses, and economic life was once stagnated.

In light of this situation, the work team sent to the township by the higher authorities and the Shangzhuang Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, after research, decided to, based on the ideological situation of the masses, on the one hand, continue to publicize the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain to dispel the concerns of the masses, and on the other hand, starting from the production and life requirements of the masses, conscientiously organize the daily economic life of the masses through the supply and marketing cooperative, and carry out the adjustment work between surplus grain households and grain-deficient households, and the adjustment of different grain varieties among farmers. The specific practices are as follows:

I. First of all, comprehensively explain the policy to the masses, focusing on the fact that it is glorious to continue to sell surplus grain to the cooperative and the exchange after the unified purchase, and that mutual exchange among the masses is also allowed. The cooperative held a meeting to educate cadres to treat farmers selling grain warmly and to publicize the policy to the masses at any time. When the masses understood this, the township's grain quickly circulated, and the supply and marketing cooperative could purchase several hundred jin of grain every day, and at most more than one thousand jin a day.

II. Conscientiously organize the economic life of the masses to meet the needs of the masses' lives. In the unified purchase of grain, a total of 1,142,730,000 yuan in currency was put in, and 1,079,810,000 yuan has been recovered, leaving little cash in the hands of the masses. In light of this situation, the cooperative organized two small-scale material exhibitions (small-scale material exchange fairs), through which it purchased surplus grain from the masses and put in a batch of currency. For example, farmer Shi Xiaowa sold 2,000 jin of grain during the unified purchase, and sold another 100 jin of grain at the exhibition to buy floral cloth for his daughter-in-law. Farmer Yao Yuanlin has 800 jin of wheat in stock and 1,000,000 yuan in cash deposited in the township cooperative. The cooperative learned that he was saving grain and money to buy livestock, so it rushed back a head of livestock from the county cooperative union and sold it to him. That night, he sold 370 jin of wheat.

III. Starting from organizing workshop production, solve the problem of supplying edible oil and other non-staple foods to the masses. There is one oil mill, two flour mills, one vinegar mill, and several tofu workshops in the township. The supply and marketing cooperative and various workshops have made specific studies. Except that the two flour mills cannot solve the problem of raw materials on their own, other tofu workshops can solve it on their own. After research, it was explained to the workshops that finished products can be exchanged for grain, and it was stipulated that all non-raw material grains exchanged shall be sold to the cooperative, and the cooperative shall organize its processing when the raw material grain is insufficient. In January alone, one flour mill exchanged back 3,300 jin of grain. The supply and marketing cooperative also organized two flour mills to process 1,400 jin of beans. Chang Yuzhu, who makes tofu, was supplied with 91 jin of beans by the supply and marketing cooperative in January, and he sold 83 jin of miscellaneous grains to the supply and marketing cooperative (non-raw material grain exchanged back). In this way, the vinegar mill saw that there was no problem with the raw materials, and its concerns were relieved. It automatically reported that its grain reserves were still enough for several months and that the government did not need to supply it. The cooperative also supplies a certain amount of white flour to restaurants every day, and the problem of white flour supply in restaurants is also solved. At the same time, the cooperative organized oil mills to process oil for the masses. Every jin of sesame can be exchanged for one or two more oil, and people with oilseeds are very satisfied. In this way, the stagnation of grain transactions after grain purchase in rural areas has been changed, and the rural economy has been invigorated.

    太谷县上庄乡供销合作社组织群众调剂粮食的经验
    中国共产党山西榆次地方委员会
    山西省太谷县上庄乡在完成统购粮食任务之后，又及时地抓住了从满足群众生产、生活要求入手，认真组织群众经济生活，积极组织社会存粮运转，来活跃农村经济，推动生产与互助合作运动的发展。仅一月份该乡供销合作社就收购了群众存粮二万三千二百八十二斤，同时也供应了缺粮户粮食与给群众调剂种粮四千二百五十六斤，供应了粉坊、豆腐坊等原料三千三百七十七斤，并组织了油坊为群众加工榨油，解决了当地群众副食品供应问题。
    该乡在粮食统购结束时，由于对群众中互通有无的政策贯彻不够全面和深入，因此群众中思想顾虑很多，经济生活一度陷于停滞状态。
    根据这种情况，上级派到该乡的工作组和中国共产党上庄乡支部经过研究，决定根据群众思想情况，一方面继续宣传粮食统购统销政策，解除群众顾虑，同时从群众生产和生活要求入手，经过供销合作社认真组织群众日常的经济生活，进行余粮户缺粮户之间的调剂工作，和农民之间的不同粮种的调剂工作。具体做法如下：
    一、首先在群众中全面地讲解政策，着重说明：在统购后继续把余粮卖给合作社和交易所是光荣的，群众中互通有无也是允许的。合作社召开了会议，教育干部对农民卖粮要热情招待，并随时向群众宣传政策。当群众摸清这个底以后，该乡粮食很快周转开了，供销合作社每天可收购粮食几百斤，最高每天能收购一千斤以上。
    二、认真组织群众经济生活，满足群众生活要求。在粮食统购中，共投放货币十一亿四千二百七十三万元，已回笼十亿七千九百八十一万元，留在群众手中的现款不多。根据这种情况，合作社又组织了两次小型物资展览会（小型物资交流会），通过展览会又收购了群众的余粮，投放一批货币。如农民史小娃统购时已卖粮二千斤，展览会上又卖粮一百斤给媳妇买了花布。农民要元林现存八百斤麦子，并在该乡合作社存有现款一百万元，合作社了解他存粮存钱要买牲口，就到县合作社联合社赶回牲口卖给他一头，当晚他就卖出小麦三百七十斤。
    三、从组织作坊生产入手，解决群众食油等副食品供应问题。该乡有油坊一座，粉坊二座，醋坊一座和几家豆腐坊，供销合作社和各个作坊作了具体研究，除两座粉坊不能自行解决原料问题外，其他豆腐坊都可自行解决。经研究后，向作坊说明可以用成品换粮食，规定换下非原料粮食一律卖给合作社，原料粮不够时由合作社组织其加工。仅一个粉坊一月份即换回粮食三千三百斤。供销合作社又组织两家粉坊加工一千四百斤豆子。做豆腐的常玉珠一月份由供销合作社供给他豆子九十一斤，他卖给供销社杂粮八十三斤（换回的非原料粮）。这样，醋坊看见原料不成问题了，顾虑解除了，自动报出他存粮还够好几个月用，不用政府供应。合作社又每天供应饭铺一定数量的白面，饭铺白面供应问题也解决了。同时合作社组织了油坊给群众加工榨油，每斤芝麻可多换油一两，有油料的人都很满意。这样，就改变了农村中购粮后粮食交易的停滞状态，活跃了农村经济。
