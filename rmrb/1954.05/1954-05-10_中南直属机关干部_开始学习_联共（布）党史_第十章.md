    Cadres of Central South Directly Subordinate Organizations
    Begin Studying Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)"
    Cadres in the advanced and intermediate groups of the Central South Directly Subordinate Organizations who are participating in theoretical study, having studied the Party's general line during the transition period and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, began to transition to the study of Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" starting from May 5th.
    On May 5th, Li Fanfu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a mobilization report to the cadres of the Central South Directly Subordinate Organizations participating in this study. In order to make everyone pay attention to this study and prevent complacency in learning, the Party Committee of the Central South Directly Subordinate Organizations pointed out the shortcomings of various organizations in the past theoretical studies, such as failure to complete the study plan on time, and the generalization of leadership methods in the theoretical education of cadres. It requested that all organizations earnestly overcome these shortcomings, and at the same time, gave specific instructions on the methods and organizational leadership of this study. All branch party committees and all branches have made specific arrangements according to the instructions of the party committee. In order to overcome the shortcomings of generalized leadership methods in the theoretical education of cadres, the branch party committee of the Central South Financial and Economic System determined key branches and key groups when arranging the study, so as to summarize the learning experience in a timely manner and provide specific guidance for the study. Before the start of the study, all branch party committees and all branches conducted re-organization of the study organization and hired additional theoretical instructors. At present, the Marxist-Leninist Night School has arranged the courses for lecturing on Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," and invited Yuan Zhen, Deputy Director of the Urban Work Department of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Niu Peicong, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Central South Administrative Committee, and Zhao Cuichu, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, to serve as lecturers. Comrade Yuan Zhen gave the first lesson on April 30.
    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC is currently actively carrying out preparations for leading the study of Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee plans to form a separate Marxist-Leninist Night School for cadres of large factories with a large number of people and a high concentration of people, so that factory cadres can study well even when they are busy with production and have less time to study. At the same time, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee has drafted a study plan and compiled relevant study reference materials. In order to improve the quality of teaching and strengthen tutoring, in addition to organizing professional cadres engaged in theoretical education to study first, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee will also organize lecturers to conduct collective lesson preparation. It is expected that by the end of May, cadres in the advanced and intermediate groups participating in theoretical study in Wuhan will fully transition to the study of Chapter 10 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)."

    中南直属机关干部
    开始学习“联共（布）党史”第十章
    中南直属机关参加理论学习的高级组和中级组的干部，在学习了党在过渡时期的总路线和中共七届四中全会文件的基础上，自五月五日起开始转入
  “联共（布）党史”第十章的学习。
    五月五日，中共中央中南局宣传部李凡夫副部长对中南直属机关参加这一学习的干部作了学习动员报告。为了使大家重视这一学习，并防止学习上的自满情绪，中南直属机关党委指出了各机关过去在理论学习中不能按时完成学习计划，以及干部理论教育工作中领导方法一般化等缺点，要求各机关认真加以克服，同时对这次学习的方法和组织领导等问题作了具体指示。各分党委、各支部都根据党委的指示，作了具体布置。中南财经系统分党委为了克服干部理论教育工作中领导方法一般化的缺点，在布置学习时，确定了重点支部、重点小组，以便及时总结学习经验，具体地指导学习。在学习开始以前，各分党委、各支部都进行了重新整顿学习组织，增聘理论教员等准备工作。目前，马克思列宁主义夜校已经排好了讲授“联共（布）党史”第十章的课程，聘请中共中央中南局城工部副部长袁振、中南行政委员会财政经济委员会副主任牛佩琮、中共中央中南局农村工作部副部长赵翠初等担任讲师。袁振同志已于四月三十日讲授第一课。
    中共武汉市委会目前正在积极进行领导学习“联共（布）党史”第十章的准备工作。市委宣传部准备将人数较多且较集中的大工厂的干部，单独组成一个马克思列宁主义夜校，以便使工厂干部在生产忙、学习时间少的情况下能很好地学习。同时，市委宣传部已拟订了学习计划，编印了有关的学习参考资料。为了提高教学质量和加强辅导工作，市委宣传部除已组织担任理论教育工作的专业干部先行学习以外，并将组织讲师进行集体备课。预计五月下旬，武汉市参加理论学习的高级组和中级组的干部即可全面转入“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习。　　（本报武汉记者站）
