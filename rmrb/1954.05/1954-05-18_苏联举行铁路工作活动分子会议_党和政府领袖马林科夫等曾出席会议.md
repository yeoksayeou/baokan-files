Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: According to TASS, the Soviet Union held a meeting of railway work activists from the 4th to the 11th of May in the Kremlin, Moscow. The meeting was attended by 2,200 advanced workers, scientists, engineers, and trade union cadres from various railway departments.

Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Malenkov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Pervukhin, and Shvernik attended the meeting.

The Minister of Railways of the Soviet Union, B. Beshchev, gave a report at the conference on the railway work of 1953 and measures for the further development of railway transportation. He pointed out that the volume of railway freight in 1940 was 6.3 times that of 1913, and the current volume has increased to more than 12 times that of 1913. Last year's freight plan was completed by 101.3 percent. To ensure the faster transportation of agricultural products, consumer goods, and other urgently needed goods, 627 new stations were established in 1953, and more than 150 express freight trains were added. Speaking of the Soviet state's efforts to improve the material and cultural living standards of railway employees, Beshchev pointed out that the average wage of Soviet railway workers has doubled compared to pre-war levels, and the actual wage has increased even more. In the past three years, houses with a construction area of more than 2 million square meters have been built for railway workers, and railway employees have built more than 30,000 private houses with the help of state loans. The government has also allocated huge sums of money to build clubs, schools, kindergartens, and nurseries. Last year, the allocation for health services increased twofold compared to 1940, and the number of sanatoriums and rest homes also increased. To train railway transportation talents, a specialized college, 15 higher education institutions, more than 100 technical schools, and 39 driver schools have been established.

Beshchev finally talked about the shortcomings in railway transportation, construction organization, and other railway enterprise work, as well as measures to bring railway work to a higher level.

The meeting discussed Beshchev's report. Attendees put forward suggestions for further tapping the potential of railway transportation and criticized the shortcomings in railway work. They also exchanged experiences in increasing production and practicing economy. Socialist Labor Hero and locomotive driver A. Papavin said when talking about his advanced experience that by paying attention to the maintenance of locomotives, he enabled locomotives to travel 1.5 million kilometers without major repairs. The famous transportation innovator and one of the leaders of the Moscow-Lisen railway line, N. Lunin, pointed out that if the load capacity of all railway trains in the country is increased by only 1 percent, the fuel consumption can be reduced by 0.4 percent, and the transportation cost can be reduced by about 90 million rubles. Due to the improvement of the drivers' skills, the average load capacity of freight cars in 1953 increased by 20 percent compared to 1940. G. Shumilov, driver of the Red Bay Station of the Don River Railway, said that in the first 26 days of April, the locomotive team of the Red Bay Station transported 300,000 tons of goods over the plan. Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences I. Nikolaev emphasized that scientific workers must carefully study the experience of advanced drivers. He said that scientific workers should devote themselves to designing new locomotives with high efficiency and low operating costs.

The meeting adopted a letter to all railway workers in the Soviet Union. The letter pointed out that when the Soviet Communist Party's policy on ensuring the rapid increase of agricultural and consumer goods production on the basis of continuous development of heavy industry is being implemented, the task of railway workers is to comprehensively improve transportation work and greatly increase transportation volume. The letter to railway workers called on all railway workers to fully utilize their potential, improve labor productivity, extensively carry out socialist competition, and strive to complete and over fulfill the 1954 national plan.

    苏联举行铁路工作活动分子会议
    党和政府领袖马林科夫等曾出席会议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联铁路工作活动分子会议，已于四日到十一日在莫斯科的克里姆林宫举行。参加会议的有铁路各部门先进工人、科学家、工程师和工会干部二千二百人。
    苏联共产党和政府领袖马林科夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、别尔乌辛和什维尔尼克曾参加会议。
    苏联交通部部长鲍·别什切夫在大会上作了关于一九五三年铁路工作和进一步发展铁路运输的措施的报告。他指出，一九四零年的铁路运货量为一九一三年的六点三倍，而现在的运货量已增为一九一三年的十二倍以上。去年的货运计划完成了百分之一百零一点三。为了保证更迅速地运输农产品、消费品和其他迫切需要的货物，一九五三年已新设了六百二十七个车站，加开了一百五十多列快速货车。别什切夫在谈到苏维埃国家对于提高铁路员工的物质和文化生活水平时指出，苏联铁路工人的平均工资已比战前增加了一倍，实际工资增加得更多。最近三年来，已为铁路工人建筑了建筑面积达二百多万平方公尺的房屋，铁路员工在国家贷款的帮助下共建筑了三万多幢私人住宅。政府还拨了巨款来建筑俱乐部、学校、幼儿园和托儿所。去年卫生事业的拨款比一九四零年增加了两倍，疗养院和休养所的数目也增加了。为了训练铁路运输人才，已设立了一个专门学院、十五个高等学校、一百多个技术学校和三十九个司机学校。
    别什切夫最后还谈到铁路交通、建筑组织和其他铁路企业工作中的缺点，以及把铁路工作提到更高的水平的措施。
    会议就别什切夫的报告进行了讨论。到会者提出了进一步挖掘铁路运输潜力的建议，并对铁路工作中的缺点提出了批评。他们还交流了增产节约的经验。社会主义劳动英雄、机车司机亚·帕帕文在谈到他的先进经验时说，由于注意保养机车，他使机车行走一百五十万公里而不需要大修。著名的运输革新者、莫斯科—利森铁路线的负责人之一尼·卢宁指出：全国所有铁路列车的载重量只要增加百分之一，便可以使燃料的消耗量减少百分之零点四，使行车费用减少约九千万卢布。由于司机们的技术提高，一九五三年货车的平均载重量比一九四零年提高了百分之二十。顿河铁路红湾车站司机格·舒米洛夫说：在四月份的头二十六天中，红湾车站的机车小组超计划运输了三十万吨的货物。苏联科学院通讯院士伊·尼古拉耶夫强调指出科学工作者必须仔细研究先进司机的经验。他说：科学工作者应该致力于设计效率高而行车费用低的新型机车。
    会议通过了告苏联全体铁路工作人员书。书中指出，当苏联共产党关于在重工业不断发展的基础上保证急速提高农产品和消费品生产的政策正在实施的时候，铁路工作人员的任务就是全面改进运输工作，大大提高运输量。告铁路工作人员书号召全体铁路工作人员充分利用潜力，提高劳动生产率，广泛开展社会主义竞赛，争取完成和超额完成一九五四年国家计划。
