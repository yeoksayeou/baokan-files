    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 23rd: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on May 22nd, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side, acting on instructions, issued a statement regarding the May 7th letter from the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) to the Military Armistice Commission, which proposed amending the Armistice Agreement. The statement pointed out that the Swedish and Swiss members' proposal was without any justification and was rejected by the Korean-Chinese side. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho further pointed out that the U.S. delegation attending the Geneva Conference published this letter on May 17th and used it to intensify its deceptive propaganda that the NNSC was unable to fulfill its supervisory duties. This was merely to cover up the fact that the U.S. side was seriously violating the Armistice Agreement by illegally bringing in large amounts of military reinforcements, and by restricting and hindering the work of the NNSC inspection teams in the U.S. controlled areas. This facilitated the U.S. side's further undermining of the existence of the NNSC and coordinated with the U.S. side's activities to obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference.
    
    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out that there is no need for a large rotation of military personnel during the armistice period, and the amount of damaged and consumed war materials should not be large. Moreover, since it is an armistice period, there is no apparent necessity to replace every damaged and consumed item of war material. Therefore, the fact that our side only carries out a small amount of rotation and replacement reflects our strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the Armistice Agreement. As for which of the five designated ports of entry our side uses for rotation, that is entirely our own business and not subject to interference by others. Therefore, the proposal of the Swedish and Swiss members of the NNSC to amend the Armistice Agreement and change the three designated ports of entry in our area is without any justification, and the Korean-Chinese side resolutely rejects this proposal.
    
    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho further pointed out that the Armistice Agreement is a solemn agreement reached between the two sides after more than two years of negotiations. However, the U.S. side has seriously violated many clauses of the Armistice Agreement, forcibly detaining a large number of our captured personnel, abducting and forcibly detaining countless of our civilians, carrying out various provocative acts against our area, shipping large quantities of reinforcing war materials into Korea, and restricting and obstructing the work of the NNSC inspection teams in South Korea in every possible way. In order to safeguard the provisions of the Armistice Agreement relating to the NNSC, and in order to safeguard the NNSC's power to exercise its legitimate functions, the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC, based on the various facts discovered during the inspection process by the NNSC inspection teams stationed in South Korea, justly exposed the illegal acts of the U.S. side in introducing military reinforcements and interfering with and obstructing the NNSC inspection teams. However, the U.S. side not only did not immediately stop these illegal acts, but also slandered the many legitimate efforts made by the Polish and Czechoslovak sides, who impartially performed their legitimate functions at both the northern and southern ports of entry, to supervise the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. This approach by the U.S. side is not only intended to cover up its own exposed illegal acts, but also to further undermine the existence of the NNSC and undermine the various clauses of the Armistice Agreement relating to the NNSC, so as to more freely and illegally introduce large amounts of military reinforcements. Therefore, the important issue at present is not to amend the relevant clauses of the Armistice Agreement, but how to maintain the integrity of the Armistice Agreement and stop the U.S. side's consistent violations of the Armistice Agreement.
    
    At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 22nd, the U.S. side, as usual, made empty slanders against the Korean-Chinese side, but failed to provide any facts, and therefore could not support the Swedish and Swiss members of the NNSC's proposal to amend the Armistice Agreement. Nevertheless, the U.S. side brazenly stated that there should be so-called "reasonable inspection methods" in the North, which shows that the U.S. side is plotting to create new excuses to undermine the NNSC.

### 李相朝中将奉命发表声明  拒绝瑞典瑞士委员修改停战协定的建议

    李相朝中将奉命发表声明
    拒绝瑞典瑞士委员修改停战协定的建议
    【新华社开城二十三日电】在五月二十二日的军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将就中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员五月七日致军事停战委员会建议修改停战协定的信奉命发表声明指出，瑞典委员和瑞士委员的建议是没有任何理由的，朝中方面予以拒绝。李相朝中将并指出：出席日内瓦会议的美国代表团所以在五月十七日发表了这一信件，并利用它来加紧进行所谓中立国监察委员会已无法履行其监察职务的欺骗性宣传，只是为了要掩盖美方严重违反停战协定，非法运进大量军事增援，百般限制，阻挠在美方地区的中立国视察小组的工作的事实，便于美方进一步破坏中立国监察委员会的存在，并配合美方阻挠日内瓦会议进展的活动。
      李相朝中将指出：停战期间不需要大量军事人员的轮换，而毁坏、耗损的作战物资也不应该数量很大，同时既然是在停战期间，也看不出有任何必要一定要对每一毁坏、耗损的作战物资进行替换。因此，停战后我方只进行少量的轮换与替换，这正是反映了我方对停战协定的文字与精神的严格遵守。至于我方在进行轮换时，使用五个特定口岸中的那几个口岸，那完全是我方本身的事情，不容别人过问。因此，中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员主张修改停战协定，改换在我方地区的三个特定口岸的建议是毫无理由的，朝中方面坚决拒绝这一建议。
    李相朝中将并进一步指出：停战协定是双方间经过二年多的谈判所达成的庄严协议，但美方却严重破坏了停战协定中的许多条款，强迫扣留了我方大量被俘人员，掳走并强制扣留了我方无数平民，向我方地区进行种种挑衅行为，运入朝鲜大量增援性作战物资，并百般限制和阻挠在南朝鲜的各中立国视察小组的工作。中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员为了维护停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的规定，为了维护中立国监察委员会行使其合法职司的权力，乃根据驻于南朝鲜的各中立国视察小组在视察过程中所发现的种种事实，公正地揭露了美方进入军事增援，干涉阻挠中立国视察小组的各项非法行为。但美方不但没有立即停止此等非法行为，反而对在北方口岸和南方口岸都公正地执行合法职司的波兰方面和捷克斯洛伐克方面为监督停战协定的实施所作的许多正当的努力进行诬蔑。美方这种做法不但是要掩盖它自己被揭露的那些非法行为，而且还企图进一步破坏中立国监察委员会的存在，破坏停战协定有关中立国监察委员会的各项条款，以便更放手地非法进入大量军事增援。因此，当前的重要问题决不是修改停战协定有关条款，而是如何维护停战协定的完整，停止美方一贯违反停战协定的行为。
    美方在二十二日军事停战委员会会议上照例对朝中方面进行空洞的诬蔑，但却举不出任何事实，因而也无法支持中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员关于修改停战协定的主张。虽然如此，美方却又蛮横表示，在北方应有所谓“合理的视察办法”，这说明美方正在图谋制造新的借口，以破坏中立国监察委员会。
