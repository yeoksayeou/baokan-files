Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The state-owned Central Metrology Factory has been completed and put into production in Beijing. During the trial operation stage before the official start of production, the factory had already produced analytical balances, industrial balances, platform balances, bench scales, platform scales, floor scales, rail scales, and copper weights for verification, which are supplied to industrial, grain, and metrology verification departments. After officially starting production, in addition to continuing to produce these products, it will also trial-produce new products for industrial and agricultural use that previously needed to be imported, such as automatic scales, television balances, and automatic recording scales within this year. The products will gradually adopt new Soviet styles. In the future, this factory will be responsible for supplying standard measuring instruments to metrology verification institutes and other metrology factories across the country.

The Central Metrology Factory is currently the largest metrology factory in the country. The factory has seven workshops, including woodworking, foundry, forging, machining, fitting, painting, and tool repair. Most of the production uses machinery.

The construction of this factory began in 1951. During the construction process, the workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. Now, except for the non-production construction projects such as the factory office building which have not yet been completed, the rest have been completed. During the construction of the factory, this factory also trained a group of workers in metrology factories and machinery factories in Shanghai, Changchun, Dalian, Nanjing, and other places to meet the needs of production.

On May 5th, the Central Metrology Factory held a commencement ceremony. Wang Xinyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, Cao Lu, Deputy Director of the Light Industry Administration, Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Lu Yu, Deputy Director of the Industrial Department of the Municipal Committee, attended the commencement ceremony and visited the factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th: One of China's newly built large-scale cement plants, the Datong Cement Plant, has recently begun partial construction. By the end of April, more than ten projects, including the repair shop, material warehouse, and substation, had been successively started at the factory. The entire construction project of the new Datong Cement Plant is carried out in two steps. In 1954, the reconstruction of the original Datong Cement Plant, which was destroyed before liberation, and the ancillary projects of the new factory are required to be completed. In 1955, the construction of the new factory will begin. The cement plant, which is now being rebuilt, will serve as an independent production workshop of the new cement plant. After this workshop is put into production at the end of this year or early next year, it can partially meet the needs of capital construction in the nearby area, and at the same time prepare sufficient cement for the larger-scale construction project of the new factory.

The new Datong Cement Plant is a factory with new equipment and a high degree of mechanization in the production process. From the entry of raw materials into the factory to the packaging and delivery of products, it is all operated with mechanized equipment. A continuous transportation line consisting of air pumps, slurry pumps, and thick iron pipes will cleverly connect all the workshops of the factory. All raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products will be automatically transported using air pressure, ensuring uninterrupted continuous production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 7th: The state-owned North China Sugar Refinery began construction near Baotou City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on May 1st.

The newly built North China Sugar Refinery will be one of the most technologically advanced and largest beet sugar refineries in China. The degree of mechanization of the production process is very high, and even the transportation, packaging, and stacking of finished products require very little heavy manual labor from workers. After the factory is completed, according to its design capacity, it can process 1,000 tons of beet raw materials per day and produce 22,000 tons of granulated sugar per year.

The area along the railway line from Hohhot to Baotou in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is very suitable for growing sugar beets. According to the results of trial planting in the past two years, the average yield of sugar beets per mu is more than 3,000 jin, and high-yield households can produce 9,000 jin per mu. The sugar content of sugar beets is above 20 percent. The establishment of the North China Sugar Refinery here can obtain raw materials locally, and at the same time greatly increase the income of local farmers.

### 国营中央度量衡工厂正式投入生产  大同水泥厂和华北制糖厂分别动工兴建

    国营中央度量衡工厂正式投入生产
    大同水泥厂和华北制糖厂分别动工兴建
    【新华社七日讯】国营中央度量衡工厂已经在北京建成投入生产。在正式投入生产前的试车阶段，这个工厂就已生产了供给工业、粮食和度量衡器检定部门用的分析天平、工业天平、架盘天平、台秤、案秤、地秤、轨道衡、检定用铜法码等产品。正式投入生产后，除继续生产这些产品外，并将在今年内试制工农业用的过去需要进口的自动秤、电视天平、自动纪录秤等新产品。产品将逐渐采用苏联新式样。今后，这个工厂将担负供给全国各地度量衡检定所和其他度量衡工厂用的标准度量衡器的任务。
    中央度量衡工厂是目前全国最大的度量衡工厂。全厂有木工、铸工、锻工、机工、钳工、油工、工具修理等七个车间，生产大部使用机械。
    这个工厂是在一九五一年开始兴建的。在建设过程中，职工们表现了高度的积极性。现在，除工厂办公大楼等非生产建设工程尚未完工外，其余已全部完成。在建厂过程中，这个工厂还在上海、长春、大连、南京等地各度量衡厂和机械厂培养了一批工人，以适应生产的需要。
    五月五日，中央度量衡工厂举行了开工生产典礼，中央人民政府轻工业部副部长王新元、轻工业管理局副局长曹鲁和中共北京市委副书记刘仁、市委工业部副部长陆禹参加了开工典礼，并参观了工厂。
    据新华社太原七日电：我国新建规模宏大的水泥厂之一——大同水泥厂，已在最近部分动工。到四月底，这个厂陆续施工的工程有修理厂、材料库、变电所等十多项。新建大同水泥厂的整个建厂工程分两步进行。一九五四年要求完成解放前遭到破坏的原大同水泥厂的重建和新建厂的附属工程，一九五五年开始新厂的建设。现在施工重建的水泥厂，将作为新建水泥厂的一个独立生产车间。这个车间在今年底或明年初投入生产后，可以部分满足附近地区基本建设的需要，同时为新建厂更大规模的建设工程准备下足够的水泥。
    新建大同水泥厂是一座新式设备、生产过程高度机械化的工厂。从原料进厂直到产品包装出厂，都是利用机械化设备操作的。一条由空气泵、泥浆泵和粗大铁管组成的连续运输线，将把全厂各个车间巧妙地连结起来。所有原料、半成品和成品，都要利用空气的压力自动运输，保证不间断的连续生产。
    【新华社呼和浩特七日电】国营华北糖厂五月一日在内蒙古自治区包头市附近动工兴建。
    新建的华北糖厂，将是我国技术设备最先进产量最大的甜菜机制糖厂之一。生产过程的机械化程度很高，就连运送、包装和堆积成品也很少有工人繁重的体力劳动。这个厂建成后，按照它的设计能力，每天能处理一千吨的甜菜原料；每年能产白砂糖两万两千吨。
    内蒙古自治区呼和浩特到包头铁路沿线一带很适宜于种植甜菜。根据两年来试种的结果，每亩平均产甜菜三千多斤，丰产户每亩能产九千斤。甜菜含糖量在百分之二十以上。华北糖厂建立在这里，可以就地取得原料，同时可以使当地农民的收入大大提高。
