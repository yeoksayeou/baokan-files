Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 8th: The Parisian newspaper "l'Humanité" published an editorial on the 3rd, calling on the French people to further expand the movement to demand a ceasefire in Indochina. The editorial pointed out that people hope to restore peace in Indochina. Any delay in stopping the conflict and ceasefire would cost France a terrible price. This shows the importance of the achievements already made at the Geneva Conference. We can say without exaggeration that the Geneva Conference has actually made more progress than some people predicted. Some people once predicted that the conference would not last long. However, despite Dulles' departure, the conference continued as usual. What the U.S. Secretary of State is worried about is precisely what hundreds of millions of people hope for. China participated in the Geneva Conference. Bidault and his Bảo Đại had to negotiate with the true representatives of the Vietnamese people – the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The editorial pointed out that the United States is attempting to expand the Indochina War. Only under the pressure of the people can Bidault be forced to fulfill his promise regarding the Geneva Conference and restore peace in Indochina. This demand of the people has been expressed through many actions. Many patriots sent telegrams to Geneva or sent delegations to Geneva to express their opinions.

The editorial called on the French people to further expand a powerful movement to force Bidault to take certain actions in terms of negotiations and peace. The editorial said that the broad unity of all forces in the country is a necessary condition for achieving a ceasefire in Indochina as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: TASS, Paris, May 7th: A nationwide movement to strive for an end to the Indochina War has been launched extensively in France. The General Confederation of Labour of France, the Council of Gard Department, the Autonomous Union of Teachers of Saint-Denis, the Progressive Republican Alliance, and many other organizations advocate establishing peace in Indochina on the basis of negotiations with representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and an immediate cessation of military operations. "l'Humanité" reported that a delegation from the Union of French Women went to Geneva, preparing to deliver to the representatives of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries a letter calling for the restoration of peace in Indochina. Other delegations will also go to Geneva to express to the participants of the conference the will of the French people to end the Vietnam War.

    法国人民广泛要求停止印度支那战争
    纷纷派代表团前往日内瓦表示法国人民的愿望
    【新华社柏林八日电】巴黎“人道报”三日发表社论，号召法国人民进一步展开要求印度支那停火的运动。社论指出，人们希望恢复印度支那和平。任何拖延停止冲突和停火都会使法国付出可怕的代价。由此可见日内瓦会议已经获得的成就的重要性。我们可以毫不夸大地说：实际上，日内瓦会议已比某些人所预言的情况进展得更多了。某些人曾经预言会议不会开很久。然而，尽管杜勒斯走掉了，但是会议仍然照样开着。美国国务卿所忧虑的却正是亿万人民所希望的。中国参加了日内瓦会议。皮杜尔和他的保大要和越南人民的真正代表——越南民主共和国代表谈判了。
    社论指出，美国正在企图扩大印度支那战争。只有在人民的压力下，才可能迫使皮杜尔实践他关于日内瓦会议的诺言，恢复印度支那和平。人民的这种要求已通过许多行动表现出来了。许多爱国者打了许多电报到日内瓦去，或是派了代表团到日内瓦去，表示他们的意见。
    社论号召法国人民进一步展开强大运动，来迫使皮杜尔在谈判及和平方面采取某些行动。社论说，全国的一切力量的广大团结，是尽速获得印度支那停火的必要条件。
   【新华社八日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：法国全国广泛地展开了争取停止印度支那战争的运动。法国总工会、加尔省参议会、圣但尼市教师自治工会、进步共和联盟和其他许多组织，都主张在和越南民主共和国的代表进行谈判和立刻停止军事行动的基础上，在印度支那建立和平。“人道报”报道，法兰西妇女联盟代表团前往日内瓦，准备交给法国、英国、美国、苏联和其他国家的代表一封要求恢复印度支那的和平的呼吁书。其他代表团也将前往日内瓦，向会议的参加者表示法国人民要求结束越南战争的意志。
