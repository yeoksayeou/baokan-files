Henan Province has established four new state-run mechanized farms this year. These farms are mostly built on wasteland along the Huai River and Yellow River basins. For example, the land of the Huaibin Farm was a grassy wasteland along Rabbit Lake and Tong Lake. Waterlogging was eliminated during the Huai River management project, and the farm planted more than 1,000 mu of coarse grains this summer. The 13,500 mu of land at the Banciao Farm was originally a swamp. After the completion of the Banciao Reservoir, the floodwaters were contained, and this swampy land can not only be safely cultivated, but also irrigated using the reservoir's water. The Zhongmu Farm is built on a vast Yellow River滩 (beach/shoal). It will gradually expand as the Yellow River is harnessed. Currently, the farms are building infrastructure and engaging in production with the assistance of local farmers.

The wheat cultivated by the Xihua and Bo'ai agricultural machinery and tractor stations in Henan Province for local agricultural production cooperatives is growing particularly well. The wheat cultivated by the Bo'ai Shazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative using machinery has thick stalks and large ears, reaching four *shi chi* (approx. 4.2 ft), nine *cun* (approx. 9 inches) taller than wheat in non-mechanized areas. The wheat sown by the Xihua Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Station for the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative using the cross-seeding method is expected to yield around 400 *jin* (approx. 440 lbs) per mu, more than twice the local average yield.

Four new agricultural machinery and tractor stations have been built in Henan Province this year, and they are very popular among local farmers. When the station construction personnel arrived in Dimao Township, Xiangcheng County, the farmers greeted them from afar. When the farmers of Guowangdu Township, Anyang County, heard the news of the establishment of the tractor station, they encouraged each other, saying, "We must run the cooperative well! Using machines to farm, socialism will come faster!" The Xihua and Bo'ai agricultural machinery stations have now repaired their machines and signed contracts with cooperatives, and are about to begin harvesting wheat. The newly built agricultural machinery and tractor stations are also working with cooperatives to study this summer's trial farming and other tasks.

    河南省今年新建四个国营机耕农场
    六个农业机器拖拉机站正在准备夏季作业
    河南省新建立了四个国营机耕农场。这些农场大都建立在沿淮河和黄河流域的荒滩上，如淮滨农场的土地，是沿兔子湖和潼湖一片草荒，在治淮中解除了水患，该场今年夏季就播种了一千多亩杂粮。板桥农场的一万三千五百亩土地，原来也是一片水洼，板桥水库建成后，拦蓄了洪水，这片水洼地不仅可以安全耕种，并且还能利用水库的水来灌溉。中牟农场是建立在一片广阔的黄河滩上，它将随着黄河的治理，逐年发展扩大。现在各场正在当地农民的协助下，一边建场一边生产。

    河南省西华博爱两个农业机器拖拉机站给当地农业生产合作社代耕的小麦，长得特别好，博爱莎庄农业生产合作社用机器耕作的小麦，秆粗穗大，高达四市尺，比非机耕区小麦高九寸。西华农业机器拖拉机站给先锋农业社用交叉法播种的小麦，预计每亩能收四百斤左右，超过当地一般产量一倍多。
    河南省今年又新建了四个农业机器拖拉机站，深受当地农民欢迎。建站人员到襄城县堤庙乡时，农民老远就去迎接。安阳县郭王度乡农民，听到建立拖拉机站的消息时，大家互相鼓励说：一定要把合作社办好呀，用机器种地，社会主义来的就更快啦。现在西华、博爱两个农业机器站，已把机器修理停当，并与合作社订好了合同，即将开始收割小麦。各个新建农业机器拖拉机站也正在与合作社共同研究今年夏季的试耕等工作。
