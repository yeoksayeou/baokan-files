In order to lay the foundation for improving enterprise management and technical level, the workers of Daye Steel Plant have launched a craze for cultural learning. The number of workers participating in spare-time middle schools and spare-time study classes in the whole plant has reached 4,000, including responsible cadres of the factory, workshop directors, section chiefs, branch secretaries, and workers of various types of work such as iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, and steel forging.

Among the cadres of Daye Steel Plant, 70% have a cultural level below junior high school, and more than 70% of the workers are illiterate or semi-literate. Thus, they encountered great difficulties in improving enterprise management and technical level. Since the factory shifted to focusing on the production of high-quality steel last year, in order to improve the technical level of workers, it has successively held 32 spare-time technical training classes, explaining the steel production process, Soviet expert suggestions, and technical operating procedures, but the students were not able to easily accept technical theory due to their low level of education. At the same time, since the factory implemented planned management in August last year, many transferred cadres and worker cadres also encountered many difficulties in their work due to the limitations of their cultural level. Therefore, this year the factory has established spare-time middle schools mainly to improve the cultural level of cadres, and has also established 104 cultural study classes; most of the students in the original technical study classes have also started with learning necessary cultural knowledge this semester.

The students are very diligent in their studies. Since the opening of various spare-time schools and study classes in March, the attendance rate has remained above 95%; those who are absent also insist on making up lessons in order to catch up with the learning progress. Many cadres, although very busy with work, can find time to do exercises. Mutual-aid learning groups collectively review lessons to help comrades with lower cultural levels "not fall behind." When Qi Weiji, a worker in the open-hearth furnace workshop, led the learning group to the southwest to help a fraternal factory build furnaces, they brought their textbooks and workbooks with them and insisted on studying.

    为提高企业管理水平和技术水平打下基础
    大冶钢厂职工掀起文化学习热潮
    大冶钢厂职工掀起了学习文化的热潮。全厂参加业余中学和业余学习班学习的职工，已达四千人，其中有工厂的负责干部，有车间主任、科长、支部书记，以及炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、锻钢等各工种的工人。
    大冶钢厂的干部中，有百分之七十不及初中文化水平，工人中有百分之七十以上是文盲和半文盲。这样，他们在提高企业管理水平与技术水平中就遇到了很大的困难。该厂从去年转入以生产优质钢为主以后，为提高职工技术水平，曾先后举办了三十二个业余技术训练班，讲解钢铁生产过程、苏联专家建议与技术操作规程等，但学员因文化程度太低，不易接受技术理论。同时，该厂从去年八月实行计划管理以后，许多转业干部与工人干部也因为文化水平限制，在工作中碰到很多困难。因此，该厂今年举办了以提高干部文化为主的业余中学，又举办了一百零四个文化学习班；原有的技术学习班的学员，在这一学期也多半从学习必要的文化知识入手。
    学员们在学习中非常用功。各种业余学校与学习班从三月份开学以来，上课人数都保持在百分之九十五以上；缺席的也都坚持补课制度，以便赶上学习进度。许多干部虽然工作很忙，都能抽时间作习题。学习互助小组集体温习功课，帮助文化低的同志“不掉队”。平炉车间工人祁维记领导的学习小组调到西南帮助兄弟厂修建炉子时，都带着课本、练习本，坚持学习。　（大冶钢厂教育科）
