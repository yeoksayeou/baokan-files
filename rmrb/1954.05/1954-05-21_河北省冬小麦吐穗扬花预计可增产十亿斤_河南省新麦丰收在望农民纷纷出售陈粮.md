    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th. It is expected that Hebei Province's more than 33 million mu of winter wheat will have a bumper harvest. This year, the winter wheat harvesting area in Hebei Province has expanded by nearly 20% compared to last year. Based on the current growth situation, it is estimated that the average yield per mu will increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year, and the total output will increase by about 1 billion jin compared to last year's total output. At present, winter wheat in various places is sprouting and flowering and will soon be filling; the warmer southern regions can be harvested in early June.
    In order to strive for increased winter wheat production, Party and government leading organs and the peasant masses at all levels in Hebei Province have made a series of efforts. When planting wheat last autumn, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued instructions emphasizing the importance of greatly increasing wheat production. Ma Guorui, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xue Xun, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, led more than 100 technicians and cadres with drainage experience to waterlogged areas to guide farmers in draining water and planting wheat. The province distributed more than 90 billion yuan in wheat seed, fertilizer, and draught animal loans, supplied more than 200 million jin of fine fertilizer and 730,000 jin of pesticides. These measures ensured the completion of the wheat planting task, and reasonable close planting was promoted in many areas. Last winter and this spring, Party and government organs in various places generally attached importance to leading farmers to strengthen field management of winter wheat, carrying out activities such as harrowing, rolling, weeding, topdressing, and watering. Insect pests such as red spiders occurred in some areas, and they were promptly eliminated. The late frost in the mountainous areas of Handan and Xingtai prefectures in southern Hebei on April 20th did not damage the wheat seedlings because of good protection.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th. Henan Province's new wheat harvest is in sight, and farmers are selling more and more old grain. According to statistics from 135 national grain markets in major wheat-producing areas such as Xinyang, Queshan, Huaibin, Suixian, Xihua, Fugou, and Luoyang, the average daily market volume of various grains in early May increased by two times compared to early April. Some of these grains were adjusted by farmers among themselves, and the rest were purchased by state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives. At present, the grain sold by farmers is mostly surplus grain left in their hands after last year's planned grain purchase. Now that a bumper wheat harvest is in sight in various places, farmers are eagerly sending their stored old grain to the primary grain markets for sale.

    河北省冬小麦吐穗扬花预计可增产十亿斤
    河南省新麦丰收在望农民纷纷出售陈粮
    【新华社保定二十日电】河北省三千三百多万亩冬小麦可望丰收。今年河北省冬小麦收获面积比去年扩大近百分之二十，根据目前生长情况估计，平均每亩将比去年增产一成到两成，总产量将比去年全年总产量增加十亿斤左右。现在各地冬小麦正吐穗扬花，将要灌浆；气候较暖的南部地区六月初即可收割。
    为争取冬小麦增产，河北省各级党、政领导机关和农民群众作了一系列的努力。去年秋季种麦时，中共河北省委员会和河北省人民政府曾发出指示，强调大量增产小麦的重要性。中共河北省委员会第二书记马国瑞和河北省人民政府副主席薛迅，带领一百多名技术人员和有排水经验的干部到内涝地区领导农民排水种麦。全省共发放麦种、肥料、耕畜贷款九百多亿元，供应细肥二亿多斤和农药七十三万斤。这些措施保证了种麦任务的完成，不少地区并推行了合理密植。去冬今春，各地党、政机关又普遍重视领导农民加强冬小麦田间管理，进行耙麦、轧麦、锄麦、追肥、浇水等活动。部分地区发生红蜘蛛等虫害，都及时除治。四月二十日南部邯郸、邢台两专区的山区降晚霜，也因为防护较好，麦苗未受冻害。
    【新华社开封二十日电】河南省新麦丰收在望，农民出售陈粮日渐增多。据信阳、确山、淮滨、睢县、西华、扶沟、洛阳等主要小麦产区的一百三十五个国家粮食市场统计，五月上旬每天平均上市的各种粮食，比四月上旬增加了两倍。这些粮食一部分由农民相互进行了调剂，其余一部分为国营粮食部门和供销合作社收购。目前农民出卖的这些粮食，多是去年粮食计划收购后剩在手中的余粮。现在因为各地小麦丰收在望，农民们就纷纷把所存的陈粮送到初级粮食市场上出售。
