The technical innovation movement, mainly focused on improving old equipment, is becoming more widespread and in-depth in factories in Shenyang. In the first quarter of this year, employees of one hundred and twenty-eight factories put forward a total of 11,441 rationalization proposals (of which more than 11,300 were from state-owned and locally state-owned factories), improving production. In the cold working shop of Shenyang Transformer Factory, the proportion of processes using manual methods was reduced from 80% to 40%, and labor productivity increased by about 30%. Employees of Shenyang Wire Factory submitted 420 proposals in the first quarter, ensuring the completion of the production plan and creating more than 8.2 billion yuan of wealth for the country. After the implementation of technical innovations in state-owned factories, the value created per workday in the first quarter increased by an average of 5.9% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, adding more wealth to the country.

    沈阳市各工厂广泛展开技术革新运动
    沈阳市各工厂以改进旧设备为主要内容的技术革新运动，日益广泛和深入。今年第一季度里，有一百二十八个工厂的职工提出了合理化建议共一万一千四百四十一件（其中国营和地方国营工厂占一万一千三百多件），改进了生产。沈阳变压器厂冷作车间用手工方式加工的工序，由百分之八十减少到百分之四十，劳动生产率提高百分之三十左右。沈阳线材厂职工在第一季度提出的建议达四百二十件，保证完成了生产计划，并为国家多创造了八十二亿余元的财富。国营工厂实行技术革新后，第一季度平均每一工作日创造的价值，比去年第四季度增加了百分之五点九，为国家增加了更多的财富。
