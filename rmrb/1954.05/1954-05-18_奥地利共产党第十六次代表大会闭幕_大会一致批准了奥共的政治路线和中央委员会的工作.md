Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 17th: According to TASS, the 16th Congress of the Communist Party of Austria concluded on May 16th.

    Johann Koplenig made a concluding speech, pointing out that the discussion of the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Austria at the congress focused on the issue of uniting all democratic forces in the country to fight for the independence of Austria, and on the issue of establishing joint action by the working class. Koplenig emphasized that the danger of a new German-Austrian merger should be opposed, and the struggle to ensure Austria's independence should be carried out as a political struggle against the government's anti-popular policies and for the realization of the economic demands of the working people.

    He pointed out that this struggle must be closely linked with the struggle of the German democratic forces to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany. Koplenig also pointed out that the 16th Congress attached great importance to the work of the Communist Party among the peasants.

    The Congress unanimously approved the political line of the Communist Party of Austria and the work of the Central Committee.

    Amidst thunderous applause from delegates and guests, the Congress passed a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Subsequently, the Congress passed the Austrian Communist Party's programmatic report "The Road to Achieving and Ensuring Austria's Independence" and the Amendments to the Constitution of the Communist Party of Austria.

    The participants in the congress also passed a congratulatory telegram to the Vietnam Workers' Party.

    Next, the Congress held elections for members of the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission.

    At the conclusion of the Congress, the chairman of the Congress, Hannar, said: We, members of the Communist Party of Austria, with the support of all peace-loving people, guarantee to defend peace with all our strength, and to do everything possible to make Austria worthy of being a member of the great family of peace-loving nations.
