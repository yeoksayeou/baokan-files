Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 16th. Hebei Province's mountainous soil and water conservation projects, with the focus on further governing the Yongding River and protecting the Guanting Reservoir, have fully commenced. This year, Hebei Province plans to build more than 6,600 check dams and 39 revetments, excavate 4 water ponds and 240 meters of contour terraces, and build 3,000 meters of field ridges in the mountainous areas of Wei County, Huaian, Fuping, and six other counties in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, Daqing River, and Ziya River. These projects can be completed before the flood season, and after completion, they can slow down floods and intercept more than 1.38 million cubic meters of sediment. The focus of the projects is on the Sanggan River and Yang River, the two tributaries in the upper reaches of the Yongding River. In addition to building check dams, it is also planned to afforest 15,000 mu of water conservation forests in the Sanggan River basin and nearly 9,000 mu of riverbank protection forests in the Yang River basin.

Approximately one-third of the area of Hebei Province's river basins is in mountainous areas, with steep slopes and concentrated rainfall, resulting in severe soil erosion in the mountains, which not only makes the land increasingly barren, but also affects the safety of river defenses in the middle and lower reaches due to sediment deposition. This situation is particularly serious in the Yongding River. To this end, the Hebei Provincial People's Government began to pilot soil and water conservation projects with a focus in the autumn of 1951. Over the past three years, more than 40,000 check dams have been built in 20 counties in the upper reaches of the Daqing River, Ziya River, Yongding River, and Jiyun River, accumulating sediment on more than 16,000 mu of land. Some of this land has already been planted with crops and trees, maintaining and expanding arable land in mountainous areas, and playing a certain role in reducing sediment accumulation and flooding in the middle and lower reaches of various rivers.

    以治理永定河、保护官厅水库为重点
    河北省今年山区水土保持工程全面动工
    【新华社保定十六日电】河北省以进一步治理永定河、保护官厅水库为重点的山区水土保持工程已全面动工。今年河北省计划在永定河、大清河、子牙河上游的蔚县、怀安、阜平等九个县山区修建谷坊六千六百多座、护岸三十九处，挖水池四个、水平沟二百四十公尺，修田间土埂三千公尺。这些工程可在汛前竣工，完成后可缓洪拦沙一百三十八万多立方公尺。工程重点是在永定河上游的桑乾河、洋河两支流上，除修筑谷坊工程外，并计划在桑乾河流域营造水源林一万五千亩，在洋河流域营造护滩林近九千亩。
    河北省河流的流域，约有三分之一强的面积在山区，坡度大，雨水集中，以致造成山区严重的水土流失，不仅使土地日益瘠薄，并使中下游河道因泥沙淤淀而影响河防安全，这种情况尤以永定河为严重。为此，河北省人民政府早在一九五一年秋季就开始有重点地试办水土保持工程。三年来共在大清河、子牙河、永定河、蓟运河上游山区二十个县份修建谷坊工程四万多座，淤沙面积一万六千多亩，其中已有部分土地种上了庄稼和树木，保持和扩大了山区耕地，对减轻各河道中下游泥沙淤积和洪水泛滥也起了一定作用。
