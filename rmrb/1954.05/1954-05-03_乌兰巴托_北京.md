On April 15th, the snow in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, had not yet melted. At 3:00 PM that day, the "Mongolian People's Republic Ulaanbaatar—Beijing Cycling Expedition Team," composed of thirteen "knights of steel," set off from Sukhbaatar Square on bicycles towards Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China.

These thirteen "knights of steel" were selected from nearly a thousand young and middle-aged people from eighteen provinces across the country who enthusiastically signed up to participate in this long-distance expedition. They include workers, university students, teachers, as well as personnel from the military and government agencies, including air force pilots, tank drivers, and national ski and weightlifting athletes. Carrying the entrustment of the people of the whole country, they were to rush to Beijing before May 1st to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations.

On the second day of the journey, it snowed again, and the "knights" advanced in the snow. On the third day, the snow was even heavier, and the wind blew up snowflakes, filling the sky, sometimes making it impossible to see pedestrians more than ten meters away. Where the snow was deep and they couldn't ride their bikes, they pushed them forward, and in some places where they couldn't even push, they carried their bicycles. On this day, they only traveled sixty kilometers. On the fourth day, the weather was clear, and the road was easier to travel.

Thinking of Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, the "knights" felt an increase in strength, and that day they traveled until 2:00 AM, covering a total of one hundred and eighty kilometers, making up for the distance delayed by the snow.

At 1:00 PM on the 21st, the "knights" entered a certain area of Xilin Gol League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on our country's border as planned. Here, they met comrades from the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations of the Central People's Government who had rushed from Beijing to welcome them. During the rest, they enthusiastically played basketball and volleyball with the soldiers of our border defense army, and the great friendship between China and Mongolia brought them new strength.

After departing from a certain area of Xilin Gol League, they faced a vast prairie with no inhabitants. Strong winds struck the bicycles in gusts, and sometimes they encountered herds of wild animals such as gazelles. When it got dark, they set up tents on the grassland to camp, and the friendship between China and Mongolia made the brave cyclists feel warm even in this desolate area. Batu Oqir, a young worker team member in his twenties, persisted in moving forward despite suffering from a cold due to the sudden change in climate. Day after day, the "knights" relied on their enthusiasm, strength, and the two wheels of their bicycles, crossing two hundred and forty kilometers of grassland.

After passing Wudulamiao, the seat of the Sunite Right Banner government, there were more and more villages along the way, and the "knights" felt that Beijing was approaching. The bicycles accelerated, passed through our country's vast Inner Mongolian grasslands, and reached Zhangjiakou on the 26th, and continued to advance the next day. The residents of towns and villages along the way warmly welcomed the distinguished guests from afar. Young Pioneers presented flowers to the expedition members. Farmers who were cultivating in the fields put down their farm tools and applauded to welcome them. Some farmers also sprinkled water on the road to suppress the dust, so that the "knights" could safely drive to Beijing.

Continue to advance. The Great Wall appeared before the eyes of the expedition members. The team members kept riding their bicycles up the high and steep Badaling, overlooking the beautiful mountains and rivers of People's China. When descending the hill, more than a dozen bicycles flew like the wind, moving forward in the drizzle.

On the morning of the 29th, twenty-six cyclists from Beijing welcomed them to Qinghe Town, twenty-five li outside the city. When the team members, wearing gray sportswear and gold emblems with the words "Ulaanbaatar—Beijing" written in Chinese and Mongolian on their fronts, appeared on the streets of the capital, the crowd cheered along the road. The determined and brave "knights" successfully ended their long journey of more than 1,400 kilometers between "Ulaanbaatar—Beijing."

When the reporter interviewed them at the Peace Hotel, the team members were radiant and showed no signs of fatigue. Danbi, the captain of the cycling expedition, excitedly told the reporter about the fifteen-day journey, saying: We saw the construction of the new China along the way, and everyone was cheered up. We want to spend "May Day" with the Chinese people. I believe that through this visit, the friendship between the people of China and Mongolia will be enhanced. (Attached pictures)

    乌兰巴托—北京
    新华社记者　孙世恺
    四月十五日，蒙古人民共和国的首都乌兰巴托的积雪还没有融化。当天下午三时，由十三名“钢铁的骑士”组成的“蒙古人民共和国乌兰巴托—北京自行车远足队”，从苏赫—巴托尔广场乘自行车向中华人民共和国的首都北京进发。
    这十三名“钢铁的骑士”，是从全国十八个省踊跃报名参加这次长途远足队的近千名青壮年中选拔出来的。里面有工人、大学生、教师以及部队和机关的工作人员，有空军驾驶员、坦克驾驶员，还有国家滑雪选手和举重选手等。他们带着全国人民的嘱托，要在五月一日前赶到北京参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼。
    行程的第二天，天又降雪，“骑士”们冒雪前进。第三天雪更大了，狂风吹起雪花，弥漫了天空，有时在十多公尺外就看不见行人。遇到雪深的地方不能骑车，就推车前进，有的地方推也推不动，他们就扛起自行车前进。这一天只走了六十公里。第四天天气晴朗，路也好走些了，
  “骑士”们想到中国人民的首都北京，全身就增加了力量，这天一直走到下半夜两点，一共走了一百八十公里，赶出了因雪耽误的路程。
    二十一日下午一时，“骑士”们按照计划进入我国边界上的内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟某地。在这里，他们见到了从北京赶去欢迎的中央人民政府体育运动委员会和对外文化联络局的同志。休息时，他们兴致勃勃地和我国边防军的战士们打篮球、排球，中蒙的伟大友谊给他们带来了新的力量。
    从锡林郭勒盟某地出发后，前面是一片杳无人烟的辽阔草原，狂风一阵阵击打着自行车，有时还碰见成群的黄羊等野兽。天黑了，他们就在草地上架起帐棚露宿，中蒙的友谊使勇敢的自行车手们对这荒凉地带也感到温暖。二十多岁的青年工人队员巴图敖其尔，虽因气候的突然变化患了感冒病，也坚持前进。这样，一天又一天，“骑士”们依靠着自己的热情、力量和自行车的双轮，越过了二百四十公里的草原。
    过了苏尼特右旗政府所在地温都尔庙，沿途的村庄越来越多了，“骑士”们觉得北京临近了。自行车加速前进，驶过我国辽阔的内蒙古草原，二十六日到达张家口，次日又继续前进。沿途市镇和村庄的居民热烈地招待远道而来的贵宾。少年先锋队员们把鲜花献给远足队员们。正在田里耕种的农民们，放下农具鼓掌欢迎。有些农家并在路上洒了水，压住尘土，好让“骑士”们安然地驶往北京。
    继续前进。万里长城出现在远足队员们的眼前。队员们一直骑着自行车爬上高峻的八达岭，眺望着人民中国的锦绣山河。下岭时，十多辆自行车像飞一样，冒着小雨前进。
    二十九日上午，北京市的二十六个自行车运动员到城外二十五里的清河镇欢迎他们。当身着灰色运动服、前身披带着红色的用中蒙两国文字写着“乌兰巴托—北京”的金字标志的队员们出现在首都街头时，人群夹道欢呼，坚毅勇敢的“骑士”们胜利地结束了“乌兰巴托—北京”间一千四百多公里的长途行程。
    当记者在和平宾馆访问他们时，队员们精神焕发，脸上看不到疲劳的神色。自行车远足队队长丹毕向记者讲述十五天的行程时，兴奋地说：我们沿途看到新中国建设的情景，大家都欢腾起来了，我们要和中国人民一起度过“五一”节。相信通过这次访问，一定会增进中蒙两国人民之间的友谊。（附图片）
