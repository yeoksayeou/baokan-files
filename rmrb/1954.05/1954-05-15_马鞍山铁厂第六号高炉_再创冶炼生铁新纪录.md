Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 14th: The state-owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant's No. 6 blast furnace set a new national record for small iron smelting furnaces producing foundry pig iron on May 2nd. The effective volume occupied per ton of pig iron smelted by the blast furnace was reduced to 0.619 cubic meters, and the qualification rate of pig iron reached 100%.

　　In the past few months, all the workers of the No. 6 blast furnace, due to the conscientious implementation of advanced Soviet ironmaking experience, successively created two new national ironmaking records on February 4th and March 11th. Later, they summarized the experience of creating the two new records and put forward the slogan of "no pride, no complacency, and strive for greater victories in production." Since April, they have also implemented the advanced Soviet "furnace top regulation method," which better utilizes the thermal energy of the gas, increasing the ore load per ton of coke from 1.7 tons to 1.9 tons, thereby increasing pig iron production and reducing the effective volume of the furnace.

    马鞍山铁厂第六号高炉
    再创冶炼生铁新纪录
    【新华社合肥十四日电】国营马鞍山铁厂第六号高炉在五月二日再创全国小型炼铁炉冶炼翻砂生铁最高新纪录。高炉每炼一吨生铁所占的有效容积降低到零点六一九立方公尺，生铁的合格率达到百分之百。
    过去几个月来，六号高炉的全体工人由于认真推行了苏联先进的炼铁经验，在二月四日和三月十一日先后创造了两次全国炼铁新纪录。后来，他们总结了两次创造新纪录的经验，提出了“不骄傲、不自满、争取生产上更大胜利”的口号。四月份以来，他们又推行了苏联先进的“炉顶调剂法”，更好地利用了煤气的热能，使每吨焦炭负荷的矿石由一点七吨增加到一点九吨，因此，又提高了生铁产量，降低了炉子的有效容积。
