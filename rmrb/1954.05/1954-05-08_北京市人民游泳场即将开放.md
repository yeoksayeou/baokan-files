    Beijing People's Swimming Pool to Open Soon
    Summer is here, and the Beijing People's Swimming Pool is about to open. This year, the swimming pool has undergone significant improvements in environment, hygiene, and facilities. In the past, the changing rooms only had cold water showers, and because there were not many shower heads, swimmers often had to wait a long time before entering the pool. This year, warm water showers (corridor-shaped) have been added at the entrance from the changing rooms to the pool, with warm water spraying from long pipes in an interlaced manner. Swimmers must pass through here before entering the pool, which maintains the cleanliness of the pool water and invigorates the swimmers' bodies. On the northeast side of the sunbathing area, various sports equipment such as single and parallel bars, combined exercisers, stall bars, and ground-level diving platforms (no more than one meter high, for beginners to learn diving) have also been added. To maintain the cleanliness of the pool water, the drain has been re-modified to ensure that the pool water is filtered and circulated daily.
    The area around the swimming pool will be arranged into a beautiful little park. Currently, the sunbathing area, sports ground, and visitor area have all been covered with grass. Pomegranate, oleander, and palm trees have been planted in the flower pots in the sunbathing area, and monthly roses, cannas, and gomphrena have been planted in the flower beds in the visitor area.

    北京市人民游泳场即将开放
    夏季开始了，北京市人民游泳场即将开放。今年，游泳场在环境、卫生和设备方面都有了很大的改进。过去，游泳场的更衣室仅设有冷水淋浴，而且因喷头不多，游泳的人往往要等候很久才能进入池子。今年，在更衣室通往池子的入口处增设了温水淋浴（走廊形的），由长长的管子里交织地喷出温水；游泳的人必须经过这里才能入池，这样就保持了池水的清洁，并使游泳的人增进身体的活力。在日光浴场的东北面，还添设了单双杠、联合器、肋木和地上跳台（它的高度不过一公尺，可供初学跳水的人使用）等各种体育运动器械。为保持池水的清洁，放水口已重新加以改装，使池水每天循环过滤。
    游泳场的四周，将布置成一个幽美的小公园。现在，日光浴场、运动场、参观区都已铺上草皮。日光浴场上的花盆里栽下了石榴、夹竹桃和棕树，参观区的花坛也种下了月季花、美人蕉、十样锦等花。
