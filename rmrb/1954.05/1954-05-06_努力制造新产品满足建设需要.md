Soviet Six H One Two Vertical Milling Machine

The Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Factory is stepping up the trial production of the Soviet Six H One Two vertical milling machine. This machine tool has a maximum speed of 1,500 revolutions per minute, is both precise and has strong cutting performance, and is equipped with an advanced electrical control device. This machine tool is suitable for the manufacturing industry for making heavy or light machinery.

In the trial production of new products, in order to solve major technical problems, the factory held the Wang Chonglun Innovation School, organizing advanced producers and veteran technical workers from the entire factory to study and solve critical problems with the spirit of technical innovation. For example, the spiral bevel gear did not meet the standards. After technicians Tian Jingzhao, Zhang Huizhi, Zhang Songhua, and others studied it, they repaired the old spiral bevel gear milling machine. The technicians, construction workers, and workers who participated in the trial production fully demonstrated their enthusiasm in their work. When processing the vertical milling machine bed, the capacity of the existing boring machine equipment was insufficient, and the fixture plus the bed exceeded the load of the boring machine. After technicians Xu Yujie, construction worker Chen Ziyu, and veteran worker Yang Tingrong studied it, they used a radial drill instead of a boring machine.

With the efforts of all the employees who participated in the trial production of new products, the main parts of the more than two thousand kinds of parts have been put into production one after another, and it is expected that the finished product will be available in mid-May.

High-Temperature and High-Pressure Hot Oil Pump

The state-owned Shanghai Refinery recently successfully trial-produced a high-temperature and high-pressure hot oil pump. The high-temperature and high-pressure hot oil pump is an important machine in the refinery. It is like the human heart. Without this oil pump, the oil will stop in the pipe and cannot flow, and the hot oil cannot be sent into the refining tower to refine various types of oil. This oil pump must be able to withstand high temperatures and high pressures because the temperature of the oil is as high as 350 degrees Celsius, and it must be able to withstand a pressure of 12 kilograms in each square centimeter (the size is about the same as a shirt button). Therefore, its precision is very high, and the difference cannot exceed five ten-thousandths of a thread (a hair is three threads). China has never manufactured such oil pumps in the past. Recently, the state-owned Shanghai Refinery has successfully trial-produced it. The results of the test run in mid-March showed that the suction and operation of the oil pump fully met the standards. This has solved an important key problem for the expansion project of the Shanghai Refinery and the manufacture of future oil refining machinery and equipment.

Belt Continuous Scale

The Shenyang Instrument Factory has successfully manufactured belt continuous scales and has now begun mass production to supply heavy industrial factories and mines.

The belt continuous scale is an automatic scale installed on the conveyor belt. This scale can indicate the quantity of ore or materials passing through the conveyor belt as the conveyor belt continuously runs. For example, to know how much ore a mine can produce in a day, you can simply look at the pointer on the belt scale installed on the conveyor belt.

Last year, the Instrument Factory began trial-producing China's first belt continuous scale. In order to trial-produce this scale, the factory concentrated the main technical forces of the entire factory. First, technicians went to Anshan Iron and Steel to make a sketch according to the standards of the Soviet belt continuous scale, and then designed and manufactured according to the Soviet standards. Two technicians were specifically responsible for guiding the operation. Hundreds of parts of the entire scale were drawn by veteran worker Geng Jingshan. After successful manufacturing, technicians from the factory personally installed it on the conveyor belt at Anshan Iron and Steel. After testing, the accuracy was only 5/1000s off, and the quality was very good.

After the successful manufacture of the belt continuous scale, it has brought great convenience to mining transportation in China. Many coal mines, smelting plants, and some heavy factories in various places have placed orders with the factory. In order to mass-produce this scale, the factory has trained 14 professional workers and two installation workers. A large number of belt continuous scales can be manufactured this year to supply various mines and factories.

Cable Yarn

The state-owned Zhejiang Hemp Textile Factory has recently successfully manufactured high-grade cable yarn using jute fiber according to advanced Soviet technology. The factory has now undertaken a batch of cable yarn orders.

General cable yarn is spun from jute fiber. Its main purpose is to protect the wires inside the cable, prevent corrosion (the yarn is coated with tar), and is an important protective layer in the cable. In the past, China could not manufacture this kind of yarn and used ordinary linen to replace cable yarn. After the cable yarn is successfully manufactured, the cost can be greatly reduced.

Electric Scraper Winch

The Liaoxi Machinery Factory No. 1 has successfully trial-produced an electric scraper winch. The electric scraper winch is a new product that has never been made by state-owned and local state-owned machinery manufacturing departments in Northeast China. The drawings are all designed by the Soviet Union. Its characteristics are: the machine is small in size, the hoisting capacity is high, and a 20-horsepower machine can hoist 1,000 kilograms on a slope of 20 degrees. The machine is also equipped with a special automatic brake device. If the hoisting efficiency of the machine is exceeded during operation, the machine will automatically stop to avoid any accidents.

Now, the factory has sent the first batch of two electric scraper winches to Anshan and other places to support production and construction.

Sulfur-Free Rubber Wires and Cables

The Kunming Wire Factory used to manufacture wires according to British and American standards: that is, using sulfur-containing rubber to wrap copper wires. However, when the copper wire generates heat when current passes through it, it chemically reacts with the sulfur in the rubber to form copper sulfide, which corrodes the copper wire. Therefore, in the past, the copper wires of those wires always had to be plated with a layer of tin or wrapped with a layer of cloth before being wrapped with rubber. Moreover, sulfur-containing rubber cannot withstand high heat and has poor insulation performance, so the rubber wrapping has to be thick, which uses more rubber; more cotton yarn and paraffin wax are used on the outside of the rubber. Now, the factory has learned from advanced Soviet experience and has basically succeeded in trial-producing sulfur-free rubber wires and cables. Sulfur-free rubber can be directly wrapped on copper wires, saving a process and raw materials for tin plating or cloth wrapping. For example, for a 220-volt 1.0 square millimeter wire, half of the rubber, 34% of the cotton yarn, and 18% of the paraffin wax can be saved. Based on the production of a portion of products in the fourth quarter of last year alone, nearly 1 billion yuan of raw materials were saved. Since sulfur-free rubber can withstand high temperatures, the heat in the wire dissipates quickly and the insulation performance is good, so sulfur-free rubber wire has a larger current load than sulfur-containing rubber wire. Taking the 220-volt 1.0 square millimeter wire as an example, the current load can be increased to three times, that is, one wire now is equivalent to three wires in the past, and it is safer than in the past.

Extra-Large Cast Iron Pipes

The tens of thousands of tons of extra-large cast iron pipes that the Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory began producing in the second quarter of this year are being supplied in a steady stream to the needs of major projects such as China's First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Daye Iron and Steel Plant, and urban construction in Beijing and Shanghai. In the past, the Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory could only manufacture relatively large cast iron pipes, but could not manufacture particularly large iron pipes for heavy industry. In order to ensure the needs of key projects, the factory began trial-producing extra-large cast iron pipes with an inner diameter of 900 mm and a weight of 1.8 tons in the first half of last year. Through the efforts of the employees, they finally succeeded in the trial production in the first quarter of this year and began mass production in the second quarter.

Level and Flow Meter

The state-owned Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory plans to manufacture a large number of hydrological and surveying instruments this year to supply water conservancy projects such as the Wuhan Iron Bridge, Meishan Reservoir, the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the Huai River, and basic construction in various places.

A "level" is an indispensable instrument for building factories, bridges, highways, railways, and other projects. It must be used to measure the length and height of the terrain before the design and materials of the project can be planned, otherwise construction will be impossible. Survey teams searching for mineral deposits, geologists studying strata, mining, and the installation of large machines all require the use of this instrument. A "flow meter" is an indispensable instrument for water conservancy projects. It is used to measure water flow speed, water level, and water quantity.

Before liberation, most of these instruments were imported from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Germany. The factory was just a repair factory for hydrological and surveying instruments with simple equipment. After liberation, through the efforts of the employees, nearly 2,000 flow meters and more than 200 levels have been manufactured in the past four years.

Recently, the factory has successfully trial-produced several new products, including self-recording rain gauges that have a great effect on crop planting, and self-recording water level gauges that calculate river water level and ship draft efficiency. These are all more precise instruments.

    努力制造新产品满足建设需要
    苏式六H一二立式铣床
    齐齐哈尔第一机床厂正加紧试制苏式六H一二立式铣床。这种机床最高转速一千五百转，既精密又具有强力切削性能，并带有高级电气操纵装置。这种机床适用于制造重型或轻型机器的机械工业。
    在新产品试制中，为了解决重大技术问题，厂里举办了王崇伦革新学校，将全厂的先进生产者和老技术工人组织在一起，以技术革新精神研究解决关键问题的办法。如螺旋伞齿轮不合乎标准，经技术员田京兆、张慧之、张颂华等研究，修复了破旧的螺旋伞齿轮铣床。参加试制的技术员、施工员和工人，在工作中都充分发挥了积极性。加工立式铣床床身时，现有搪床设备能力不足，卡具加上床身超过了搪床的负荷量，经技术员徐宇杰、施工员陈子裕、老工人杨廷荣研究，利用摇臂钻代替了搪床。
    在参加新产品试制的全体职工努力下，两千多种部件当中的主要部件已先后投入生产，预计五月中旬即可出成品。
    高温高压热油泵
    国营上海炼油厂最近试制高温高压热油泵成功。高温高压热油泵是炼油厂的重要机器，它就像人的心脏一样；炼油厂没有这种油泵，油就停在管子里无法流转，不能把热油送进炼塔提炼出各种油类。这种油泵要经受得起高温度和高压力，因为油的温度就高达摄氏三百五十度，在每个平方公分（大小约等于一粒衬衫钮子）的地方，要能受十二公斤重的压力。因此，它的精密度很高，最多不能相差万分之五丝（一根头发是三丝）。这样的油泵，我国过去是没有造过的。最近国营上海炼油厂已经试制成功。三月中旬试车结果，油泵的吸力和运转情况都完全合乎标准。这为上海炼油厂的扩建工程和今后的炼油机械设备的制造解决了一个重要的关键问题。
      皮带连续秤
    沈阳衡器厂制造皮带连续秤成功，现已开始大量生产，供应重工业厂矿使用。
    皮带连续秤是安在运输带上的一种自动秤。这种秤随着运输带的连续运转就可以标示出经过运输带的矿石或材料的数量。比如一个矿井一天能生产多少矿石，只要看看运输带上安装的皮带秤上的指针就可以知道。
    去年衡器厂开始试制我国第一台皮带连续秤。该厂职工为了试制这种秤，曾集中了全厂的主要技术力量，首先由技术员到鞍钢按照苏联皮带连续秤的标准制成了草图，然后按苏联标准进行设计制造，有两名技术员专责指导操作；全秤几百种部件都是由老工人耿荆山划的线，制造成功后，并由该厂技术员亲自到鞍钢安装在运输皮带上，经过试验，精密度仅差千分之五，质量很好。
    皮带连续秤制造成功以后，给我国矿山运输上带来很大的便利，各地的许多煤矿、冶炼厂以及一些重型工厂纷纷向该厂订货。该厂为了大量生产这种秤，已培养出十四名专业工人及两名安装工人。在今年就可以制造出大量的皮带连续秤，供应各矿山、工厂。
      电缆纱
    国营浙江麻纺织厂，最近根据苏联的先进技术，用黄麻纤维制造高级电缆纱成功。现该厂已承制了一批电缆纱订货。
      一般的电缆纱是用黄麻纤维纺成的，它的用处主要是保护电缆里面的电线，可以防止腐蚀（纱上涂柏油），是电缆里的一种重要的保护层。过去我国不能制造这种纱，都是用普通的麻布来代替电缆纱。电缆纱制造成功以后，就可以大大降低成本。
    电耙子卷扬机
    辽西机械一厂试制电耙子卷扬机成功。电耙子卷扬机是东北各国营和地方国营机器制造部门从来没有做过的新产品，图纸全是苏联设计的。它的特点是：机器体积不大、卷扬能力较高，一台二十马力的机器就能在斜形二十度的地形上卷重一千公斤，机器上并设有自动闸的特殊装置，在操作当中一旦超过机器的卷扬效能，机器就会自动停止，可以避免发生任何事故。
    现在该厂已将制成功的第一批电耙子卷扬机两台，分别发往鞍山等地，支援生产建设。
      无硫橡皮的电线和电缆
    昆明电线厂以前是按照英美标准来制造电线：就是用有硫橡皮来包铜线。但铜线通过电流发热和橡皮中的硫磺起了化学作用成为硫化铜，就会侵蚀铜线。所以，以前那些电线的铜线上，总要在镀上一层锡或是包一层布后，再包橡皮。并且，有硫橡皮经不住高热，绝缘性能差，因此，包的橡皮要厚，用的橡胶就多；橡皮外面用的棉纱和石蜡也就多了。现在，该厂学习苏联先进经验，试制无硫橡皮的电线、电缆已基本成功。无硫橡皮可以直接包在铜线上，省去镀锡或包布的一道工序和原料。例如二二零伏一点零平方公厘导线，可以节约一半橡胶，百分之三十四的棉纱和百分之十八的石蜡。单以去年第四季度生产的一部分产品来算，就节约原料近十亿元。由于无硫橡皮能耐高温，电线中的热就散得快，绝缘性能好，所以无硫橡皮线比有硫橡皮线的电流负荷量大。再以二二零伏一点零平方公厘导线为例，电流负荷可提高到三倍，也就是现在的
  一根电线能抵得上过去三根电线用，还比过去安全。
    特大铸铁管
    鞍钢铸管厂从今年第二季度起开始生产的数万吨特大铸铁管，正源源供应我国第一汽车制造厂、大冶钢铁厂、北京及上海城市建设等巨大工程的需要。过去，鞍钢铸管厂只能制造比较大的铸铁管，而不能制造特别大的重工业用的铁管。为保证重点工程的需要，该厂自去年上半年就开始试制内径九百公厘、重一点八吨的特大铸铁管，经职工们的努力，终于在今年第一季度试制成功，并于第二季度开始大量生产。
      水平仪和流速仪
    国营南京水工仪器厂今年计划要制造大批的水文及测量仪器，供应武汉大铁桥、梅山水库、黄河、长江、淮河等水利工程和各地基本建设使用。
      “水平仪”是建筑厂房、桥梁、公路、铁路等工程不可缺少的仪器，必须用它测得地形的长度、高低，然后才可计划工程的设计和用料，否则就无法施工。勘测队寻找矿藏，地质人员研究地层，采矿以及大机器安装都必需使用这种仪器。“流速仪”是水利工程上不可缺少的仪器，它是用来测量水流速度、水位高低和水量等情况的。
    解放前，这些仪器大部从英国、瑞士、德国进口，该厂只是个设备简陋的水文及测量仪器的修理工厂。解放后经过职工们的努力，四年来已制造了近二千架流速仪和二百多架水平仪。
    最近，该厂又试制成功几种新产品，有对农作物种植有很大作用的自计雨量器，以及计算河流水位高低、船只吃水效能的自计水位计等。这些都是更精密的仪器。
