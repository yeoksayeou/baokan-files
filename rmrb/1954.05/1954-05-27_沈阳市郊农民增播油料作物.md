Farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang are actively increasing the planting area of various oil crops. The area for peanuts has increased by more than one and a half times, sunflowers by 12 percent, and sesame and jute by more than three times. At the beginning of the spring plowing season, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government sent cadres to mobilize farmers to plant more oil crops in conjunction with spring plowing production. The Shenyang Native Produce Company also sent cadres to Heishan and Faku counties in Liaoxi Province to purchase a large number of oil crop seeds. Farmers in urban areas have already signed pre-sale contracts with local supply and marketing cooperatives.

    沈阳市郊农民增播油料作物
    沈阳市郊农民积极增加各种油料作物的播种面积，花生增加到一倍半以上，向日葵增加了百分之十二，芝麻和青麻也增加了三倍多。在春耕开始的时候，沈阳市人民政府曾派出干部结合春耕生产动员农民多种油料作物，沈阳市土产公司也派出干部到辽西省黑山、法库等县采购了大批油料作物籽种。市区农民已和当地的供销合作社订立了预售合同。　　　　　　（阎文超）
