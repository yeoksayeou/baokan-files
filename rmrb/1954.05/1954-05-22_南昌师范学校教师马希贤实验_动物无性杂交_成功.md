Nanchang Normal School Teacher Ma Xixian Successfully Experiments with "Asexual Hybridization of Animals"

Nanchang Normal School biology teacher Ma Xixian, learning from the advanced scientific experience of the Soviet Union, successfully carried out an "asexual hybridization of animals" experiment by replacing chicken egg white with goose egg white. This is a good example of how our country's teachers overcome difficulties to carry out creative teaching.

On December 30th of last year, Ma Xixian hatched seven "hybrid chickens" using goose egg white to replace chicken egg white. These "hybrid chickens" have long necks, wide abdomens, thick legs, and large webs, somewhat resembling geese. These chickens are very vigorous, not afraid of the cold, and gain weight quickly. By May 8th of this year, a comparison of a "hybrid chicken" and an ordinary chicken, both hatched at the same time, showed that the "hybrid chicken" weighed 31.5 taels (approximately 1179 grams), while the ordinary chicken only weighed 24 taels (approximately 899 grams). According to the current growth trend of the "hybrid chicken" and the actual achievements of Soviet scientists, this "hybrid chicken" may reach a weight of 8 jin (approximately 4 kilograms) after another half year of growth. The success of Ma Xixian's experiment allows students to have a vivid and profound understanding of the sections on "hybridization" and "changing embryonic living conditions can cause biological variation" in biology textbooks, and greatly improves students' confidence and interest in learning science.

The success of Ma Xixian's experiment is also a valuable contribution to improving the breed of domestic poultry in our country under existing conditions, and has therefore attracted a lot of attention. He has received many letters from various places, requesting him to introduce his experience in successfully experimenting with "asexual hybridization of animals." The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau's Dairy and Meat Management Office has accepted Ma Xixian's experience and has also successfully experimented with it.

Ma Xixian conducted this experiment based on a brief report of the practical experience of Soviet biologist B. Golubev published in "Biology Bulletin." He encountered many difficulties during the experiment and failed twice, but thanks to a sense of responsibility in teaching and the support of school leaders, he finally succeeded in the third experiment. Before this experiment, Ma Xixian also made and modified several microscopes, solving the difficulty of insufficient teaching equipment, and thereby promoting the enthusiasm of other teachers. In the last semester alone, teachers throughout the school created 201 pieces of visual aids and repaired more than 30 pieces of old instruments.

Due to Ma Xixian's creativity in teaching, he was selected as an Grade B Labor Model in Nanchang City in March of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    南昌师范学校教师马希贤实验“动物无性杂交”成功
    南昌师范学校生物教师马希贤学习苏联先进科学经验，以鹅蛋蛋白替换鸡蛋蛋白进行“动物无性杂交”实验成功，这是我国教师克服困难进行创造性的教学的一个良好的范例。
    马希贤在去年十二月三十日用鹅蛋蛋白替换鸡蛋蛋白孵出了“杂交鸡”七只。这种“杂交鸡”颈长腹宽，脚粗蹼大，有些和鹅相似。这种鸡生活力很强，不怕寒冷，体重增加很快。到今年五月八日，拿同时孵出的一只“杂交鸡”和一只普通鸡比较，“杂交鸡”的体重是三十一两五钱，普通鸡只有二十四两。按“杂交鸡”现在生长的趋势和苏联科学家的实际成就来看，这种“杂交鸡”再生长半年以后，体重可能达到八市斤。马希贤这个实验的成功，使学生对于生物学教材中关于“杂交”和“改变胚胎生活条件可以引起生物变异”等部分有生动深刻的理解，并大大提高了学生学习科学的信心和兴趣。
    马希贤这个实验的成功，对在现有条件下改良我国家禽的品种，也是很有价值的贡献，因之引起了很多方面的注意，他曾先后接到了各地很多来信，要求他介绍实验“动物无性杂交”成功的经验。上海市人民政府卫生局乳肉管理所接受了马希贤的经验，也已经实验成功了。
    马希贤是根据“生物学通报”上刊载的苏联生物学家鲍·郭留勃斯基的实际经验的简短报道进行这个实验的。实验过程中碰到许多困难，并曾两次失败，但由于教学上的责任感和学校领导方面的支持，终于在第三次实验中获得成功。在这次实验以前，马希贤还曾装制和改制成好几架显微镜，解决了教学设备不足的困难，并因此推动了其他教师的积极性。仅在上学期中，全校教师就创制了直观教具二百零一件，修理破旧仪器三十余件。
    由于马希贤在教学上的创造，今年三月被选为南昌市乙等劳动模范。　（新华社）
