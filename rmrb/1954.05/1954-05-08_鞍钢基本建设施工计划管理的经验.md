    Experiences in Construction Planning Management at Ansteel
    Zhao Beike, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    Enterprise Construction Plan
    The enterprise construction plan is the foundation for construction and installation enterprises to implement planned management. The basis for preparing an enterprise construction plan is the national-approved basic construction investment plan, as well as the delivery dates of design data and equipment. The basic construction investment plan determines the project items, workload, and commencement and completion deadlines, which are then used to create the construction plan for the construction and installation enterprise.

    The main difficulties in preparing the basic construction plan (including investment and construction plans) at present are that the basic conditions for preparing the plan are not fully available or accurate, i.e., the delivery dates of design data and equipment cannot be completely confirmed in advance. This makes the current basic construction plan somewhat estimated or unstable, which is the main reason for the blind, aggressive tendencies and waiting, conservative tendencies that have occurred in the past two years when preparing the basic construction plan. Taking Ansteel's basic construction in 1953 as an example, more than 96 percent of the projects were based on preliminary designs or even without preliminary designs when the annual plan was prepared. This is, of course, impossible to be accurate. Because the workload stipulated in the preliminary design, technical design, and construction drawings varies greatly. At the same time, the delivery time of the design is often delayed, which affects the construction period. The situation regarding equipment supply is roughly the same. For example, for foreign equipment orders, except for standard equipment that can be ordered after the technical design is determined (or even after the preliminary design is decided), many non-standard auxiliary equipment must be ordered gradually after the construction drawings are released. This makes the delivery of some auxiliary equipment later, which cannot fully meet the needs of the project progress. As for domestic orders, ordering begins after the construction drawings and manufacturing drawings are made, and it generally takes two months to six or seven months to manufacture the equipment. Thus, when preparing the annual plan, many equipment orders have not yet been placed, and the plan can only be determined based on the estimated delivery time.

    Therefore, the primary task in preparing the basic construction investment plan and the enterprise construction plan is to do a good job in balancing construction prerequisites—design and equipment. This balancing work should absolutely not be done with a passive attitude of "do it if there are conditions, don't do it if there are no conditions." Instead, it should be done through careful and repeated balancing, comprehensively and thoroughly identifying the problems of design, equipment, and national plans that are not compatible, as well as the reasons for these problems, and then taking effective measures to thoroughly solve them to ensure the completion of the construction plan. At the same time, based on needs and possibilities, those secondary projects that truly have no conditions should be resolutely cut off, so as to concentrate efforts on completing the construction of key projects and ensure the country's long-term construction speed.

    When Ansteel started preparing the quarterly enterprise construction plan for 1953, the planning, engineering, design, and equipment departments, as well as the first-level contractor and second-level contractor, concentrated their efforts on balancing the design and equipment. First, the first-level contractor convened the second-level contractor to prepare a comprehensive construction operation plan based on the national plan. According to the requirements of the operation plan, it put forward requirements for design and equipment. Then, the planning department organized the design and equipment departments to balance them. During the design balance, 140 problems were raised, 90 were resolved through agreement, 25 needed to be resolved through contact with foreign countries, and 25 were not agreed upon. For all those agreed upon, the design department guaranteed to deliver the drawings according to the specified date, and the construction department adjusted the construction progress according to the delivery date of the drawings. For those not agreed upon, the design department carried out internal balancing, implemented project queuing, reduced secondary projects, and concentrated efforts on major projects to solve the difficulty of insufficient design strength, so that the design progress of major projects basically met the construction progress. As many as 10,077 problems were raised in the equipment balance. After balancing, 6,592 could be coordinated with the construction, accounting for 66 percent. Most of the remaining 34 percent had already started ordering or organized emergency ordering. Although the dates were slightly later, they could still guarantee the construction requirements. After balancing the above-mentioned construction conditions, the problems existing in the completion of several key projects were clarified. Those that could be solved were solved in a timely manner, and the problems that had not yet been solved also had clear goals, and efforts were concentrated on solving them. In addition, after repeated balancing, it was found that 12 secondary project items truly had no construction conditions, or insufficient conditions. Based on the principle of concentrating efforts on completing key projects, it was cut off with the approval of the higher authorities.

    This balancing work played a major role in strengthening planned management, organizing forces to complete the annual basic construction plan, especially the three major key projects of the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace.

    In addition to preparing the prerequisites for construction—design and equipment balance—it is also necessary to carry out various internal balancing work within the construction and installation enterprise when preparing the enterprise construction plan. That is, labor balance, construction machinery balance, material balance, processing products balance of affiliated enterprises, transportation balance, and construction coordination balance. After the balance of construction conditions and construction forces within each construction and installation enterprise, and then the balance of construction coordination between the first-level contractor and the second-level contractor, all the problems existing in the entire construction plan are clarified and resolved. In this way, the enterprise construction plan is completely built on a reliable basis, and all employees can be mobilized to give full play to their subjective initiative and tap potential strengths to solve existing problems and complete the national plan.

    Balancing is the basic method for preparing the enterprise construction plan and the main method for overcoming subjectivism in the current basic construction planning work. This method should be universally implemented and repeatedly carried out. Not only should the annual plan be balanced, the quarterly plan should be balanced, and the monthly plan should also be balanced. Even the weekly and daily operation plan must be balanced. Only through annual, quarterly, monthly, and even weekly balancing work can we gradually, deeply, and thoroughly discover and solve problems, build the plan on a reliable basis, and give full play to the mobilization and organization functions of the construction plan. This is our basic experience in implementing planned management in the past year.

      Monthly Plan
    The monthly plan is an action plan to guide and organize construction. In the current situation where annual and quarterly plans are not yet very accurate, the preparation and implementation of monthly plans are of great significance for guiding and organizing construction.

    Ansteel established a monthly plan management system in July 1952. At that time, the monthly plan was basically a construction progress operation plan, which specifically stipulated the monthly construction and installation workload tasks, organized the coordination between the first-level contractor and the second-level contractor, arranged the construction operation progress, and prepared a technical supply plan. This was relatively practical under the conditions at the time and played an important role in directly organizing construction and ensuring construction progress. However, the disadvantage was that it was not comprehensive, lacked various economic indicators, and had no cost reduction tasks. Therefore, serious waste phenomena occurred in the construction, where only progress was considered regardless of cost. In the second half of 1953, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, and after the preparation of budget quota unit prices, the monthly plan forms of Soviet construction and installation enterprises were adopted, which greatly improved the monthly plan management work.

    The new monthly plan requires a total of nine tables, which are concise and complete. The first is a comprehensive plan table, the second is a construction and installation project plan table, the third is a physical workload and labor requirement plan table, the fourth is a main material requirement plan table, the fifth is a transportation plan table, the sixth is a mechanization and construction machinery requirement plan table, the seventh is a production plan table of affiliated enterprises, the eighth is a labor requirement plan table for each type of work, and the ninth is a summary table of basic indicators. In addition, there is also a table, which is the project plan table for the site director and foreman. The advantages of the monthly plan table can be described as follows.

    First, this monthly plan is comprehensive and complete. It perfectly reflects the organic connection and cooperative relationship between various construction departments and technical supply departments, and solves the complex requirements of organizing comprehensive construction. After the plan is prepared, in order to assign tasks to the lower levels, there are also project plan tables for the site director and foreman. The site director and foreman can fully understand the monthly project tasks and various technical resource requirements with just this table.

    Second, the monthly plan stipulates complete economic indicators, which promotes the implementation of the economic accounting system. The monthly plan not only stipulates the project workload tasks, but also stipulates the labor quota, construction machinery quota, material quota, processed product quota, and transportation quota. It stipulates that the project workload tasks must be completed within various quotas, correcting the one-sided task view that disregards costs, and establishing a foundation for the implementation of quota management and economic accounting system.

    Third, the implementation of the new monthly plan, when preparing the construction and installation project plan table, takes the construction site as the unit, and the first-level contractor organizes the second-level contractors to carry out the balancing of construction coordination, prepare a comprehensive operation plan (construction instruction chart), and prepare a technical supply operation plan according to various quotas to organize the implementation of the monthly plan. Experience has proven that a plan with only construction operation progress and no economic indicators cannot promote the implementation of the economic accounting system; a plan with only economic indicators and no implementation of operation progress cannot directly organize construction. Only a monthly plan with both economic indicators and implementation progress can play a guiding role in promoting economic accounting and directly organizing construction.

    In order to do a good job in monthly plan management, the following principles should be mastered.

    First, accuracy. The monthly plan must be built on a reliable material basis and must have construction conditions such as design, equipment, materials, labor, construction machinery, and transportation. Project items that do not have conditions should not be included in the monthly plan. However, on the other hand, we must resolutely oppose the conservative thinking of passively waiting. It is also very harmful to not tap potential strengths, not try to overcome weak links, and not actively create construction conditions. Taking this passive attitude will delay the country's construction speed and directly violate the purpose of planned management. In order to ensure the reality of the plan, a comprehensive balancing of construction conditions, construction forces, and construction coordination must be carried out when preparing the monthly plan. In order to ensure the advanced nature of the plan, we must fully tap potential strengths and take measures to overcome imbalances in order to ensure the completion of the national plan. Here, the implementation of the monthly indicator control method is necessary. The monthly indicator is the workload indicator stipulated according to the annual and quarterly plans and construction conditions, especially after studying the potential strengths and the conditions that can be strived for through active efforts. If the monthly plan is not controlled, and the possibility of striving for conditions is not studied, there may be a tendency for the plan to be too conservative. Although the monthly plan can be completed, the quarterly plan and annual plan cannot be completed. The monthly plan must ensure the completion of the quarterly and annual plans, especially the completion of key projects. This is a principle that must be mastered.

    Second, directive. Once the monthly plan is approved, it is a directive that must be completed. All departments, including design, equipment, and construction departments, must work together with a serious attitude from different work positions to strive for the completion of the plan. The backwardness of any department will affect the overall situation and disrupt the plan. In the past, some comrades in the technical supply department believed that the construction plan was a matter for the construction unit and adopted an indifferent attitude, which was wrong. Some comrades in the construction department believed that the design and equipment supply were not timely, which delayed the construction, and it was not the responsibility of the construction department, and they did not take the initiative to contact and actively strive for it, which was also wrong. The various economic quotas stipulated in the plan must play their control role. It is not enough to just prepare the plan. It is necessary to control labor use, machinery use, material consumption, processed product consumption, and transportation volume according to the quota plan, and to check and prevent waste. According to expert suggestions, the "Construction and Installation Cost Analysis Table" should be universally implemented. Each construction site or section should make a comparison table of various quota plans and actual results every month, and should hold economic activity inspection meetings every month to check the implementation of various planned indicators, study the root causes of cost overruns and waste, and find ways to overcome them to reduce costs and save funds.

    Third, mass nature. The process of preparing and implementing the monthly plan is the process of mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of employees to complete the national construction plan. We must resolutely rely on the working class and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The preparation of the plan should be personally grasped by the manager, with the planning department as the main body, organizing and absorbing various functional institutions and construction units to participate together and prepare it collectively, so as to ensure that the plan is advanced and realistic. In order to realize the plan, employee representative meetings or all-employee meetings should be held monthly to report the summary of the implementation of the monthly plan and the construction plan for this month, mobilize employees to check their work, criticize shortcomings, discuss ways to implement the plan, and organize labor competitions to supervise and ensure the implementation of the plan. Secondly, in order to turn the monthly plan into the specific action plan of employees, it is necessary to prepare weekly and daily operation plans (construction instruction charts) according to the monthly plan, and organize balanced construction. Finally, it is also necessary to establish a top-down and bottom-up plan inspection system, establish a "fast daily report" statistical system in the planning department, establish a daily dispatch operation statistical system in the engineering department, and establish a weekly and daily operation meeting system in the construction site, section, and construction team. Only by establishing a complete and systematic mass-based plan inspection system can the implementation of the plan be thoroughly guaranteed.

    Weekly and Daily Operation Plan and Dispatch System
    The annual and quarterly plans can only give employees a general understanding of the annual and quarterly plans, and it is impossible to make an action plan for each employee based on it. The monthly plan is relatively specific and clear, but what to do every week and what to do every day is still not specifically determined. Therefore, with only the monthly plan and no weekly and daily operation plans, there will still be a great degree of blindness and passivity among employees in the construction process. Only by conscientiously implementing the weekly and daily operation plans can this problem be thoroughly solved and the national plan turned into the personal action plan of employees. After we implemented the weekly and daily operation plans, cadres and workers generally reported that they had a clear idea of what to do, their work was more active, they knew what to do tomorrow today, and what to do next week this week, and they no longer worked in a confused way. Therefore, we can strive for initiative and carry out construction in a planned and prepared manner. This is an important gain from the implementation of weekly and daily operation plans.

    In the past, the rush work style of construction was quite common and serious. There was idleness and shutdowns at the beginning of the month, and overtime work at the end of the month. The labor efficiency was not high, and quality accidents and safety accidents often occurred. Since the implementation of weekly and daily operation plans, this extremely abnormal phenomenon has begun to be reversed and is gradually improving. Experience has proven that the implementation of weekly and daily operation plans is the basic method for overcoming the rush nature of construction and strengthening balance.

    In order to establish and implement weekly and daily operation plans, the following work should be done well.

    First, strengthen political education, eliminate ideological obstacles, and establish the concept of weekly and daily plans. The implementation of weekly and daily operation plans is an arduous ideological struggle process. When it was first implemented, various ideological resistances were encountered. Some held a skeptical attitude, believing that although the operation plan was good, the basic construction conditions were complex, and it might not work. Some believed that there were many construction units, the coordination was not good, the technical supply was not timely, and there were many temporary problems, "Only the production department can execute the instruction chart." Some believed: "There are so many units, no one can control anyone, you have made a good plan, but you don't know when a beam will block the road, and you can't pull it away or push it away, and you can only stare blankly." Another group of people is accustomed to rush construction and does not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of the operation plan, believing that it is the same to complete the task with or without the weekly and daily plan, and it does not matter if the weekly and daily plan is not completed, but it is not possible to fail to complete the monthly plan. It does not matter if it is not completed in the first two weeks, just work hard at the end of the month to catch up. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth ideological education among all employees, repeatedly explain the significance and role of weekly and daily operation plans, dispel various unnecessary concerns, and explain that there are many construction units and the coordination is not good, and it is even more necessary to strengthen unified management and strengthen comprehensive operation plans. Only by preparing operation plans week by week and day by day, unifying pace, and cooperating closely can we do a good job in overall construction. The untimely technical supply and many temporary problems are precisely due to the inaccurate, unspecific, and unthorough plans, which can only be overcome by strengthening operation plans. With operation plans, it is possible to more effectively promote the implementation of various responsibility systems and improve construction management. Therefore, any worries and doubts are unfounded. Secondly, it is necessary to publicize the benefits of balanced construction and the harms of rush construction in order to establish a clear concept of weekly and daily plans. Once the weekly and daily operation plans are approved, they are directives that must be completed, not directives that can be completed or not completed. Units that have consistently completed the operation plans and balanced construction should be commended in a timely manner. Units that have consistently failed to complete the operation plans and relied solely on rush work to complete the tasks should be criticized in a timely manner. When starting to implement the operation plans, it should be centrally required to establish the concept of the weekly plan and complete the weekly plan. After the implementation of the weekly plan has had a certain effect and laid a certain foundation, it is necessary to emphasize the establishment of the concept of the daily plan and complete the daily plan. Because the daily plan is the basis of the operation plan, only when the daily plan is completed on time can the weekly and monthly plans be completed in a balanced manner.

    Second, to prepare weekly and daily operation plans, three links must be grasped: First, the weekly and daily operation plan is a part of the monthly operation plan and is to ensure the realization of the monthly plan and balanced construction. Therefore, the weekly plan indicator should not be less than one-quarter of the monthly indicator; otherwise, the weekly plan will be completed week by week, but the monthly plan will not be completed, or although the monthly plan can be completed, the weekly fluctuations will be large, and the purpose of balanced construction has still not been achieved. Second, technical supply is the material guarantee for ensuring the implementation of weekly and daily operation plans. It is necessary to do a good job in the technical supply operation plan, and the technical supply for the next week must be prepared in the previous week to ensure the realization of the operation plan for the next week. Therefore, each engineering company should prepare the technical supply plan for the next week before Thursday of each week and complete the preparation and distribution work. Third, construction coordination is another major link to ensure the implementation of weekly and daily operation plans. The first-level contractor should organize the second-level contractors to carry out the balancing of construction coordination based on the weekly and daily operation plans put forward by each engineering company, solve the construction connection, procedures, and coordination methods, and formulate a comprehensive operation plan for the construction site, taking the construction site as the unit. For this reason, each construction site should hold a weekly operation meeting every Friday to solve the weekly construction coordination problems, approve the operation plan for the next week, and hold daily operation meetings every day to solve the daily coordination problems and revise and approve the operation plan for the next day.

    Third, whether the operation plan can be realized depends on relying on and mobilizing all employees to turn the operation plan into the action plan of each employee. To this end, it is necessary to establish a "plan disclosure" system, that is, to explain the plan in detail to the employees. After the weekly and daily operation plan is approved by the company before Saturday, each engineering company should disclose it to the workers no later than Monday. The daily operation plan should be disclosed in detail before leaving get off work the day before. The content of the disclosure should be comprehensive, including four aspects: fast (project quantity and project progress), good (technical conditions and operating methods), economical (material quota and labor quota), and safe (working environment and safety measures). The method of disclosure can be in a way that is easy for workers to accept, such as using physical objects or demonstrations. At the same time, we must vigorously promote the advanced Soviet management system—the project task list—and disclose the project tasks, labor quotas, and material quotas to the workers in the form of a task list. Finally, the Party organization will lead the trade union and the Communist Youth League to mobilize employees to discuss the operation plan, put forward rationalization proposals, implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, promote advanced experience, and organize labor competitions to ensure the realization of the operation plan.

    Fourth, establish a dispatch system to supervise and ensure the implementation of the operation plan. Without a centralized dispatch organization to check and supervise daily and weekly and solve the problems that occur in the implementation of the operation plan in a timely and effective manner, it is impossible to ensure the daily and weekly completion of the operation plan. In the process of implementing the operation plan, construction coordination and technical supply will always have problems, which requires a sound dispatch organization to use a sensitive dispatch communication network to regularly and systematically check and deal with them. Because time is precious, any small problem that is not solved in time may affect a series of work and disrupt the operation plan.

    The dispatch organization is the manager's capable assistant in construction management. It is responsible for supervising, inspecting, and ensuring the implementation of weekly and daily operation plans, supervising and inspecting the implementation of operation plans, the implementation of technical supply operation plans, and the problems existing in construction coordination. If problems that hinder the implementation of the plan occur, the dispatch organization must direct various functional institutions and construction units to quickly take measures to solve them. The dispatch orders issued by the dispatch organization within its authority should be unconditionally executed within the scope of the company, just like the manager's orders.

    The dispatch work system is an important condition for ensuring the implementation of dispatch authority. A daily and shift dispatch operation statistical report system and a dispatch telephone conference system should be established, and combined with the construction site operation meeting system, a complete and connected operation meeting system, inspection system, and dispatch system should be established to supervise and ensure the implementation of the operation plan.

    In implementing dispatch authority and the dispatch system, two deviations must be prevented: the deviation of the dispatch organization taking over everything and replacing functional institutions, and the deviation of emphasizing that functional institutions each do their own thing, ignoring and canceling centralized dispatch. Leading cadres and functional institutions at all levels should vigorously support the authority of the dispatch organization, cultivate the courage of dispatch cadres, and establish his work prestige. The dispatch organization should promote and give full play to the enthusiasm of various functional institutions when performing its tasks. Only in this way, by combining the centralized dispatch system (supervision, inspection, and dispatch) with the enthusiasm of various functional institutions, can we improve management efficiency and do a good job in planning.

    鞍钢基本建设施工计划管理的经验
    鞍山钢铁公司副经理　赵北克
    企业施工计划
    企业施工计划是建筑安装企业实施计划管理的基础。编制企业施工计划的根据是国家批准的基本建设投资计划，及设计资料交付日期，设备交付日期。基本建设投资计划确定了工程项目、工作量与开工、竣工期限，然后根据它作出建筑安装企业施工计划。
    目前编制基本建设计划（包括投资计划与施工计划）的主要困难，是编制计划的基本条件不完全具备与不完全准确，即设计资料交付日期与设备供应日期不能事先完全肯定。这样就使得目前基本建设计划带有若干程度的估计性或不稳定性，这也正是两年来在编制基本建设计划时发生盲目冒进倾向与等待保守倾向的主要根源。以鞍钢一九五三年基本建设为例，在编制年度计划时，即有百分之九十六以上的工程项目是只根据初步设计甚至是在没有初步设计的情况下编制的。这当然不可能准确。因为初步设计、技术设计和施工图所规定的工作量相差很大。同时，设计交付的时间也往往延迟，以致影响工期。设备供应方面的情况也大体如此。比如国外设备订货，除了标准设备在技术设计确定后（甚至在初步设计决定后）即可订货外，许多非标准的辅助设备，须待施工图出来后才能陆续订货。这样就使某些辅助设备交付较迟，不能完全满足工程进度的需要。至于国内订货，则需施工图与制造图作出后才开始订货，一般的设备需要两个月到六七个月才能制造完。这样在编制年度计划的时候，有许多设备尚未提出订货，也就只能根据估计的交货时间确定计划。
    因此，编制基本建设投资计划和企业施工计划，首要的工作是做好施工的先决条件——设计和设备的平衡工作，这种平衡工作绝对不是抱着“有条件就做，无条件不干”的消极态度，而是应该经过周密的反复的平衡，全面地彻底地发现设计、设备方面和国家计划不相适应的问题，以及这些问题产生的原因，然后采取有效的措施，彻底加以解决，以保证建设计划的完成。同时还应该根据需要与可能，坚决削掉那些确实没有条件的次要工程项目，以便集中力量完成重点工程的建设，以保证国家长期的建设速度。
    鞍钢在着手编制一九五三年季度企业施工计划时，组织计划、工程、设计、设备几个部门和大包公司与二包公司，集中力量进行了设计、设备的平衡工作。首先由大包公司召集二包公司，根据国家计划编制了综合的施工作业计划，根据作业计划的要求，提出对设计、设备的要求，然后由计划部门组织设计、设备部门进行平衡。在设计平衡中，提出了一百四十件问题，取得协议解决了九十件，须向国外联系解决的二十五件，未得协议的二十五件。凡是取得协议的，设计部门保证按照规定日期交付图纸，施工部门根据图纸交付日期调整施工进度。未取得协议的，由设计部门进行了内部平衡，实行工程排队，削减次要工程，集中力量于主要工程，以解决设计力量不足的困难，使主要工程的设计进度基本上符合于施工进度。在设备平衡中提出的问题达一万零七十七件之多，经过平衡，可以配合施工的有六千五百九十二件，占百分之六十六，其余百分之三十四大部已着手订货或组织了紧急订货，虽日期稍迟，也还可以保证施工的要求。经过上述施工条件的平衡后，几个重点工程竣工存在的问题都查清楚了，能解决的及时解决了，尚未解决的问题也明确了目标，集中力量加以解决。此外，经过反复平衡，发现有十二项次要工程项目确实没有施工条件，或条件不足，根据集中力量完成重点工程的原则，经过上级批准，把它削掉了。
    这次平衡工作，对于加强计划管理，组织力量完成全年基本建设计划，特别是完成大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和七号高炉三大重点工程起了重大的作用。
    编制企业施工计划，除了首先要准备好施工的先决条件——设计和设备的平衡外，还需要进行建筑安装企业内部的各种平衡工作。即劳动力平衡、施工机械平衡、材料平衡，附属企业加工品平衡、运输平衡和施工配合的平衡。经过各建筑安装企业内部施工条件与施工力量的平衡，再经过大包公司和二包公司在施工配合方面的平衡，就把全部施工计划中存在的问题都弄清楚并解决了。这样，企业施工计划就完全建筑在可靠的基础上，就可以动员全体职工发挥主观能动性，挖掘潜在力量来解决存在的问题，完成国家计划。
    平衡是编制企业施工计划的基本方法，是克服目前基本建设计划工作中主观主义的主要方法。这种方法应该普遍执行与反复贯彻，不仅编制年度计划要平衡，编制季度计划要平衡，编制月度计划同样也要平衡，就是每周分日作业计划也是要平衡的。只有经过逐年、逐季、逐月、甚至逐周的平衡工作，才能够逐步深入地、彻底地发现问题与解决问题，才能把计划建筑在可靠的基础上，才能发挥施工计划的动员作用与组织作用，这是我们在过去一年中实行计划管理的基本经验。
      月　计　划
    月计划是指导与组织施工的行动计划。在目前年度与季度计划都还不可能十分准确的情况下，月计划的编制与实施，对于指导和组织施工具有十分重要的意义。
    鞍钢在一九五二年七月就建立了月计划管理制度。当时的月计划基本上是施工进度作业计划，具体规定了每月建筑安装工程量任务，组织大包公司和二包公司配合，安排施工作业进度，并编制技术供应计划。这在当时条件下是比较切合实际，并起了直接组织施工、保证施工进度的重要作用。但缺点是不全面，缺少各种经济指标，没有降低成本任务，因而在施工中曾产生只顾进度不惜成本的严重浪费现象。一九五三年下半年，根据苏联专家建议，经过了编制预算定额单价的准备工作，采用了苏联建筑安装企业的月计划表格，使月计划管理工作大大提高了一步。
    新的月计划共需要九张表，简明而完整。一是综合计划表，二是建筑安装工程计划表，三是实物工作量与劳动需要量计划表，四是主要材料需要量计划表，五是运输计划表，六是机械化与施工机械需要量计划表，七是附属企业生产计划表，八是各工种劳动力需要量计划表，九是基本指标汇总表。此外还有一张表，是工地主任和工长的工程计划表。月计划表的优越性可分述如下。
    第一、这个月计划是全面的、完整的，它完满地反映了各施工部门与技术供应部门之间的有机联系与协作关系，解决了组织综合施工的复杂要求。计划编好后，为了向下面分配任务，又有工地主任和工长的工程计划表。工地主任和工长只靠这张表，就可以全面了解当月的工程任务和各种技术资源需要量。
    第二、月计划规定了完整的经济指标，促进了经济核算制的实施。月计划不仅规定了工程量任务，还规定了劳动限额、施工机械限额、材料限额、加工品限额、运输限额。规定要在各种限额内完成工程量任务，纠正了不计成本的片面任务观点，给实施定额管理与经济核算制建立了基础。
    第三、实行新的月计划，在编制建筑安装工程计划表时，以工地为单位，由大包公司组织各二包公司进行施工配合的平衡，编制综合的作业计划（施工指示图表），并根据各种限额作出技术供应作业计划，以组织月计划的实施。经验证明，只有施工作业进度而没有经济指标的计划，是无法促进经济核算制的实施的；只有经济指标而没有实施的作业进度的计划，是不能直接组织施工的。只有既有经济指标又有实施进度的月计划，才能发挥促进经济核算与直接组织施工的指导作用。
    为了做好月计划管理工作，应该掌握下列原则。
    第一、准确性。月计划必须建筑在可靠的物质基础上，必须具备设计、设备、材料、劳动力、施工机械、运输等施工条件，没有条件的工程项目，不应列入月计划。但另一方面也必须坚决反对消极等待的保守思想。不发掘潜在力量，不设法克服薄弱环节，不积极创造施工条件，也是十分有害的。采取这种消极的态度，将延缓国家建设速度，直接违反计划管理的目的。为了保证计划的现实性，编制月计划时就要进行施工条件、施工力量与施工配合的全面平衡工作。为了保证计划的先进性，就要充分发掘潜在力量，采取措施克服不平衡现象，以保证国家计划的完成。在这里，实施月指标控制办法是必要的。月指标是根据年、季计划与施工条件，特别是研究了潜在力量，研究了经过积极努力可能争取的条件而规定的工作量指标。如果对月计划不加控制，不研究争取条件的可能性，就可能产生计划过于保守的偏向，月计划虽能完成，但季计划、年计划却完不成。月计划必须保证季度和年度计划的完成，特别是重点工程的完成，这是必须掌握的原则。
    第二、指令性。月计划批准后，就是必须完成的指令，各个部门，包括设计、设备与施工部门，都须以严肃的态度，从不同的工作岗位上分工协作，共同为完成计划而奋斗。任何一个部门工作落后，都要影响全局，破坏计划。过去某些技术供给部门的同志认为施工计划是施工单位的事，采取漠不关心的态度，是不对的。某些施工部门的同志认为设计、设备供应不及时，耽误施工，不是施工部门的责任，而不采取主动联系积极争取的态度，也是错误的。计划规定的各种经济限额必须发挥其控制作用，不是编完计划就万事大吉。要根据限额计划，对劳动力使用、机械使用、材料消耗、加工品消耗及运输量加以控制，检查与防止浪费。应该根据专家建议，普遍执行“建筑安装费用分析表”。每一个工地或工段应将每个月的各种限额计划与实际结果作出对照表，并应按月召开经济活动检查会议，检查各项计划指标执行情况，研究费用超支与浪费根源，找出克服办法，以降低成本，节约资金。
    第三、群众性。月计划的编制与执行过程，就是发动与组织广大职工群众完成国家建设计划的过程，必须坚决依靠工人阶级、发挥群众的积极性和创造性。编制计划应该由经理亲自掌握，以计划部门为主，组织与吸收各职能机构和各施工单位共同参加，集体编制，才能保证计划是先进的与现实的。为了实现计划，应该按月召开职工代表会议或全体职工会议，报告上月计划执行总结与本月施工计划，发动职工检查工作，批评缺点，讨论执行计划的办法，组织劳动竞赛，以监督与保证计划的执行。其次，为了把月计划变成职工的具体行动计划，需要根据月计划编制每周分日作业计划（施工指示图表），并组织均衡施工。最后，还必须建立自上而下的与自下而上的计划检查制度，在计划部门建立“快速日报”的统计制度，在工程部门建立每日调度作业统计制度，在工地、工段与施工小组建立每周每日作业会议制度。只有建立一套完整的系统的群众性的计划检查制度，才能彻底保证计划的实施。
    每周分日作业计划与调度制度
    年度和季度计划只能使职工对全年和全季计划有个概括的认识，不可能依据它作出每个职工的行动计划。月计划是比较具体与明确了，但每周做什么、每天做什么，仍然不能具体确定。因此，只有月计划而没有每周分日作业计划，职工在施工过程中，仍然会存在很大程度的盲目性与被动性；只有认真地实行了每周分日作业计划，才能彻底地解决这个问题，把国家计划变成职工个人的行动计划。我们在推行每周分日作业计划后，干部和工人普遍反映心中有底了，工作主动了，今天知道明天干什么，这一周知道下一周干什么，再也不糊里糊涂地工作了。因此就能争取主动，有计划有准备地进行施工。这是推行每周分日作业计划的重要收获。
    过去，施工的突击作风是相当普遍与严重的，月初窝工停工，月末加班加点，劳动效率不高，质量事故和安全事故常常发生。自从推行每周分日作业计划以后，这种极不正常的现象已经开始扭转，并在逐步改进着。经验证明，实行每周分日作业计划，是克服施工突击性，加强均衡性的基本方法。
    为了建立与贯彻每周分日作业计划，应该做好下列工作。
    第一、加强政治教育，消除思想障碍，树立周、日计划观念。推行每周分日作业计划是一个艰苦的思想斗争过程。开始推行的时候，曾经遇见各种各样的思想抵抗。有的抱着怀疑态度，认为作业计划虽好但基本建设条件复杂，恐怕行不通。有的认为施工单位多，配合不好，技术供应不及时，临时发生的问题多，“只有生产部门可以执行指示图表。”有的认为：“这么多单位，谁也管不着谁，你做好了计划，不知什么时候就出来个大梁挡住路，拉不开也推不动，还不是干瞪眼。”另一种人习惯于突击施工，对作业计划的重要性认识不足，认为有没有周日计划，一样完成任务，周日计划完不成没有关系，月计划完不成可不行，头两周完不成不要紧，月末加把劲赶出来就行。因此必须在全体职工中深入地进行思想教育，反复说明每周分日作业计划的意义与作用，解除各种不必要的顾虑，说明施工单位多，配合不好，就更需要加强统一管理，加强综合作业计划。只有逐周逐日编制作业计划，统一步调，密切配合，才能搞好总体施工。技术供应不及时，临时问题多，正是由于计划不准确、不具体、不周密，只有加强作业计划才能克服。有了作业计划，才能更有力地推动贯彻各种责任制，才能改善施工管理。因此任何顾虑与怀疑都是没有根据的。其次，要宣传均衡施工的好处与突击施工的害处，以树立明确的周、日计划观念。周、日作业计划一经批准，就是必须完成的指令，而不是可完成可不完成的。对一贯完成作业计划、均衡施工的单位，要及时表扬。对一贯不完成作业计划，专靠突击完成任务的单位，应及时批评。在开始推行作业计划的时候，应该集中地要求树立周计划观念，完成周计划。在执行周计划有了一定的效果，打下一定的基础之后，就要强调树立日计划观念，完成日计划。因为日计划是作业计划的基础，只有日计划按时完成，才能保证每周每月均衡地完成计划。
    第二、编制每周分日作业计划，必须抓住三个环节：一、每周分日作业计划是月作业计划的一部分，是保证月计划实现与均衡施工的。因此周计划指标不应小于月指标的四分之一；否则周计划逐周完成，月计划反完不成，或者月计划虽能完成，而每周波动很大，仍然没有达到均衡施工的目的。二、技术供应是保证每周分日作业计划执行的物质保证，必须做好技术供应作业计划，而且一定要在上周把下周技术供应准备好，才能保证下周作业计划的实现。因此各工程公司应在每周星期四以前即作好下周技术供应计划，并完成准备与分配工作。三、施工配合是保证每周分日作业计划执行的另一主要环节，应该以工地为单位，由大包公司组织二包公司，根据各工程公司所提出来的每周分日作业计划进行施工配合的平衡，解决施工衔接、程序与配合方法，制定工地的综合作业计划。为此，各工地应于每星期五召开周作业会议，解决每周施工配合问题，通过下周作业计划，并且要每日召开作业会议，解决每日配合问题，修正与通过次日的作业计划。
    第三、作业计划能否实现，关键在于依靠与发动全体职工，把作业计划变成每个职工的行动计划。为此，就必须建立“计划交底”制度，即把计划详细地向职工交代。每周分日作业计划于星期六以前经公司批准后，各工程公司应不迟于星期一以前向工人交底。每日作业计划应于前一天下班前详细交底。交底的内容应该是全面的，包括快（工程量与工程进度）、好（技术条件和操作法）、省（材料限额和劳动限额）、安全（作业环境和安全措施）四个方面。交底的方法，可以采取用实物或示范等工人易于接受的方式；同时要大力推行苏联先进的管理制度——工程任务单，将工程任务、劳动限额与材料限额用任务单的形式，向工人交底；最后由党组织领导工会和青年团发动职工讨论作业计划，提合理化建议和贯彻苏联专家建议，推广先进经验，组织劳动竞赛，以保证作业计划的实现。
    第四、建立调度制度，监督保证作业计划的实施。没有集中的调度机构逐日逐周地检查监督，并及时地有效地解决作业计划执行中发生的问题，要想保证每日每周完成作业计划是不可能的。在作业计划执行的过程中，施工配合和技术供应总是会不断发生问题的，这就需要有一个健全的调度机构，利用灵敏的调度通讯网，经常地系统地检查与处理。因为时间是宝贵的，任何一个小问题没有及时解决，都可能影响一连串的工作而打乱作业计划。
    调度机构是经理在施工管理方面的得力助手。它负责监督检查与保证每周分日作业计划的执行，监督检查作业计划执行情况，技术供应作业计划执行情况及施工配合上存在的问题。如发生妨碍计划实施的问题，调度机构即须指挥各职能机构和各施工单位迅速采取措施，加以解决。调度机构在其职权范围内所发下的调度命令，应该像经理的命令一样在公司所属范围内无条件的执行。
    调度工作制度是保证调度职权实施的重要条件，应该建立每日每班调度作业统计报告制度和调度电话会议制度，并与工地作业会议制度相结合，建立一套完整的联系的作业会议制、检查制与调度制，以监督和保证作业计划的实施。
    贯彻调度职权与调度制度，必须防止两种偏向。即调度机构包办一切、代替职能机构的偏向和强调职能机构各尽其责，忽视与取消集中调度的偏向。各级领导干部及职能机构应该大力支持调度机构的职权，培养调度干部的勇气，建立他的工作威信。调度机构在执行任务时，则应通过与发挥各职能机构的积极性。只有这样，使集中的调度制度（监督、检查与调度）和各职能机构的积极性结合起来，才能提高管理效能，做好计划工作。
