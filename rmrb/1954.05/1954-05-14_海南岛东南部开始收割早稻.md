    Early Rice Harvesting Begins in Southeastern Hainan Island
    Early rice harvesting has begun in Qiongshan, Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, Wanning, Lingshui, and Yaxian counties in southeastern Hainan Island, and a bumper harvest is expected in most areas. In the Xitian, Gaolong, and Xinhe agricultural production cooperatives in Wenchang County, in addition to applying fertilizer two to three times to the early rice, they also applied five to ten jin of chemical fertilizer per mu when the rice was budding and developing ears, which resulted in particularly good growth. In Wanning County, many mutual aid teams had rice ears with 180 to over 200 grains, each full and plump. The county estimates that this year's early rice production will increase by 20% compared to last year.
    Before the summer harvest, all parts of Hainan Island are actively preparing for the summer harvest and planting season. Basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives are actively organizing handicraftsmen to rush-produce plows, harrows, waterwheels, grain buckets, bamboo mats, etc., to meet the needs of farmers during the summer harvest and planting season. Many mutual aid teams in Wanning County have formulated summer harvest and planting plans and discussed ways to improve work arrangement and accounting methods. In the past, the Wang Guoxiang mutual aid team in Fengyuan Township had a chaotic work arrangement during busy farming seasons, which affected field work and caused many complaints among the team members. This time, they discussed in advance to harvest rice from distant fields, low-lying fields, and early-maturing fields first to avoid losses from typhoons and waterlogging. The township also assigned Party members and cadres to take charge of leading the summer harvest work in different areas. All 95 mutual aid teams in the township, to ensure that the main labor force is invested in the summer harvest and planting season, organized nurseries and cattle herding teams during the summer harvest and assigned them to people with weak labor power to manage. At the same time, many organized farmers, in order to strive for another bumper harvest of late rice, sowed late rice seeds early and planned to plow, plant, and harvest simultaneously to strive for early planting and early harvesting of late rice to avoid damage from floods.

    海南岛东南部开始收割早稻
    海南岛东南部琼山、文昌、琼东、乐会、万宁、陵水、崖县等县早稻开始收割，大部可获丰收。文昌县溪田村、高隆村、新合村三个农业生产合作社，早稻除了施肥两次至三次外，到打苞胎穗时，每亩又施上五斤至十斤化学肥料，因此生长的特别好。万宁县许多互助组禾穗结谷一百八十粒到二百多粒，粒粒饱满，据该县估计今年早稻可比去年增产两成。
    海南岛各地在夏收前，都积极做好夏收夏种的准备工作。各基层供销合作社都积极组织手工业加工赶制犁、耙、水车、谷桶、竹席等，以供应农民夏收夏种的需要。万宁县许多互助组订出了夏收夏种计划，并讨论改进排工计工等办法。凤园乡王国香互助组过去农忙时排工很乱，田活受影响，组员意见多，这次预先讨论好先割远田、低田和早熟田的稻禾，以免遭受台风、水浸等损失。该乡并由党员、干部分片包干领导夏收工作；全乡九十五个互助组，为保证主要劳动力都投入夏收夏种，在夏收中组织托儿所和牧牛队，分配给劳动力弱的人管理。同时，许多组织起来的农民为了再争取晚稻丰收，都提早播下晚稻种籽，并计划做到边割边犁边种，以争取晚稻早种早收，避免水灾的损害。　（吴尔祥）
