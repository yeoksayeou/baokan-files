Glorious Nebula
Hu Zhao
In his speech, Kim Ung-gi, head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, said: In three years, more than 302,000 soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers have been credited for meritorious service, and more than 350,000 have been awarded medals and decorations by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In three years, they helped Korean farmers cultivate and harvest 357,000 "chongbo" of land, repaired 2,226 river embankments and 7,565 bridges, and rescued more than 3,700 Korean people. More than 300,000 medals for more than 300,000 heroes. If they were lined up on the ground, it would be a dazzling light; if they were studded in the sky, it would be a brilliant nebula. The heroes stood up their chests and defeated the enemy together with the Korean people; the heroes raised their arms and defended peace together with the Korean people; the heroes used their lofty will to win glory for the motherland. Fighting the enemy on one side and working hard on the other; they erected more than 7,000 bridges, bridges of steel, guarantees of victory; they repaired more than 2,000 river embankments, solid embankments, symbols of friendship. One medal—one bright star; more than 300,000 medals—a glorious nebula. The medals hang on the chests of heroes, and the stars shine in the eastern sky. Shine, glorious nebula! Shine, nebula of friendship! Shine, nebula of peace! Illuminate the world, illuminate people's hearts. China's pride, the people's will, make the eastern sky bright day and night.

    光荣的星云

    朝鲜人民访华代表团金应基团长在讲话中说：三年中中国人民志愿军立功者三十万二千多名，获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国勋章和奖章者三十五万多名。三年中他们帮助朝鲜农民耕种收割的土地面积达三十五万七千多町步，抢修了二千二百二十六道河堤、七千五百六十五座桥梁，抢救了三千七百多名朝鲜人民。三十多万颗奖章，给三十多万个英雄。假若把它们排在地上，就是一片耀眼的灯火；假若把它们缀在天空，就是一片灿烂的星云。英雄们挺起胸膛，和朝鲜人民一起战胜了敌人；英雄们举起臂膀，和朝鲜人民一起捍卫了和平；英雄们用崇高的意志，为祖国争取了光荣。一边打击敌人，一边辛勤劳动；他们架起七千多座桥梁，钢铁的桥梁，胜利的保证；他们修好二千多道河堤，坚固的河堤，友谊的象征。一颗奖章——一颗亮星；三十多万颗奖章——一片光荣的星云。奖章挂在英雄的胸前，星星闪耀在东方的天空。闪耀吧，光荣的星云！闪耀吧，友谊的星云！闪耀吧，和平的星云！照亮世界，照亮人心。中国的骄傲，人民的意志，使东方的天空日夜光明。
