Shandong Province Actively Carries Out Seedling Inspection, Replenishment, and Protection Work

Spring plowing and sowing in Shandong Province have basically concluded. Corn seedlings in early-sown areas are already over an inch tall, and farmers in some areas have begun thinning seedlings. According to inspections by local CCP committees and people's governments, the phenomenon of missing seedlings is widespread in spring fields. In the Jiao County Special District, over 300,000 mu of spring fields have missing seedlings ranging from 10% to 80%. The lack of seedlings is particularly serious in Rizhao, Gaomi, and Zhucheng counties. In Qinggen Township, Rizhao's Seventh District, 548 mu out of 633 mu planted with sorghum are missing seedlings. In the Liaocheng Special District, Tangyi County planted 300,000 mu of cotton, of which 210,000 mu are missing 20% of seedlings, 40,000 mu are missing 30% of seedlings, 30,000 mu are missing 50% of seedlings, and 9,000 mu are missing more than 50% of seedlings. In Anqiu County of the Changwei Special District, 81,000 mu out of 350,000 mu planted with sorghum are missing seedlings.

In order to ensure the completeness and vigor of spring seedlings this year, CCP committees and people's governments at all levels in Shandong Province are leading the masses to carry out seedling inspection, replenishment, and protection activities. The Shandong Provincial People's Government issued an instruction on summer agricultural production, calling on governments at all levels to vigorously carry out seedling inspection, replenishment, protection, and strengthening work. The Changwei Prefectural Committee of the CCP and the Changwei Commissioner's Office have made detailed studies of this work and regarded seedling inspection and replenishment as current priority tasks. The Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office have dispatched cadres to various counties to supervise and inspect the work. In the process of inspecting and replenishing seedlings, it was found that farmers had varying degrees of paralysis in their thinking, such as saying, "A little difference doesn't matter," and "Sparse crops grow big ears, and we'll eat good wheat next year." Some village cadres and the masses have the idea of "taking a rest" after spring. When carrying out this work, various localities overcame the farmers' paralysis by conducting specific inspections and calculations. Then, through cultivating model examples, organizing visits, and making comparisons, they helped mutual aid and cooperation organizations formulate seedling protection plans and launched a seedling inspection and replenishment campaign. For example, in Xiaocaiyuan Village, Seventh District of Changle County, cadres first inspected and replenished seedlings in the agricultural production cooperative, using the cooperative's actions to promote replanting in 210 households throughout the township and replanting in 19 households. Cadres in Chagnan, Changyi, Linqu, and other counties adopted the method of "finding solutions in the fields and providing on-the-spot guidance," and combined thinning and transplanting seedlings after rain for replenishment. As of May 7, Tangyi County in the Liaocheng Special District had replanted 10,150 mu of cotton. As of May 10, Linqingzhai Village in Puyang County had replanted 129 mu of cotton and hoed the cotton fields, piled soil around the cotton plants, and stepped around them to prevent underground pests. In the seedling replenishment work, the Jiao County Special District generally adopted the following methods: 1. Replenish and transplant seedlings for areas with slight seedling shortages. Transplant early in the morning with dew; if the soil is dry, water first so that the seedlings have soil around them; to promote seed growth, soak the seeds and let them germinate before replanting. 2. When severely missing seedlings require replanting, plant early-maturing, high-yielding crops such as corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes. 3. In areas with serious insect pests, use sweet potato chips mixed with "666" powder as poisoned bait to kill underground pests, or bury "666" powder underground to kill pests, and apply pesticides during replanting or replenishment to control insects.

Agricultural technology departments at all levels have attached importance to technical guidance in the work of seedling replenishment and protection. (Zhang Rongan)

    山东省积极进行查苗补苗保苗工作
    山东省春耕春播已经基本结束。早种地区的玉米苗已有一寸多高，个别地区农民已开始锄苗。根据各地中共党委和人民政府的检查，春地缺苗现象普遍存在。胶州专区全区缺苗一成到八成的春地有三十多万亩。尤其日照、高密、诸城等三县缺苗更为严重。日照七区青根乡种高粱六百三十三亩，缺苗的就有五百四十八亩。聊城专区堂邑县种棉花三十万亩，其中缺二成苗的有二十一万亩，缺三成苗的四万亩，缺五成苗的三万亩，缺五成苗以上的达九千亩。昌潍专区的安邱县共种高粱三十五万亩，缺苗的就有八万一千多亩。
    山东省中共各级党委和人民政府为保证今年春苗齐全旺盛，正领导群众开展查苗、补苗、保苗活动。山东省人民政府发布了关于夏季农业生产工作指示，号召各级政府大力做好查苗、补苗、保苗、壮苗等工作。中共昌潍地委和昌潍专署对这一工作曾作了详细研究，并把查苗、补苗工作当作当前突击任务；同时地委和专署都派遣干部分别到各县督促检查。各地在查苗、补苗工作中，都发现在农民中有程度不同的麻痹思想，如说：“差一差二不算差”、“谷稀长大穗、来年吃好麦”等。有些村干部和群众有春后“歇一歇”的思想。各地在进行这一工作时，通过具体检查、算账等办法克服了农民的麻痹思想。然后通过培养典型、组织参观、进行对比，帮助互助合作组织订立保苗计划，开展了查苗、补苗运动。如昌乐县七区小菜园村，由干部先在农业生产合作社查苗、补苗，以社的行动推动全乡二百一十户进行了补种，十九户进行了翻种。昌南、昌邑、临朐等县干部，采取“地里想办法，当场指导”，并结合间苗和雨后移苗等进行补苗。聊城专区堂邑县到五月七日止，已补种棉花一万零一百五十亩。濮阳县临清寨村到五月十日止，已补种棉花一百二十九亩。并把棉田普锄了一遍，在棉棵周围拥土，踩一遍，以防止地下虫害。胶州专区在补苗工作中普遍采取了以下办法：一、对缺苗轻的进行补种、移苗。移栽时要趁早晨露水头；如地干可先浇水，使幼苗带土；为促进种子生长，补种时先浸种发芽。二、缺苗严重必须翻种时，要种玉米、花生、地瓜等早熟高产作物。三、虫害严重地区，用地瓜干拌“六六六”粉作毒饵药杀地下害虫，或用“六六六”粉埋在地下药杀害虫，并在翻种或补种时施用农药进行除虫。
    各级农业技术部门都重视了补苗、保苗工作中的技术指导。（张荣安）
