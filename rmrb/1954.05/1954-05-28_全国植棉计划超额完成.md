National Cotton Planting Plan Exceeded

[Report from this newspaper] After the active efforts of cadres at all levels and the vast number of farmers in the cotton-producing areas across the country, this year's cotton sowing task has been successfully completed.

According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the cotton fields sown nationwide have expanded by six million mu compared to last year's cotton sowing area, exceeding the national planned cotton planting area by more than one million mu. The main cotton-producing areas, North China and East China, have both exceeded their cotton planting plans; although Central South China did not complete its cotton planting plan, it still expanded by more than 800,000 mu compared to last year. Among the provinces and cities, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Dalian have all completed or exceeded their cotton planting plans. In order to ensure the completion of the national cotton planting plan, Hebei Province, under the leadership of cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, mobilized more than 15,000 cadres in the province to go deep into the villages to inspect and guide spring plowing and sowing. Economic departments supplied cotton-growing areas with large quantities of flour and rice, and allocated coarse grains to solve the problem of livestock feed, which encouraged farmers to plant cotton. As a result, the province planted 17.4 million mu of cotton fields, exceeding the plan by 1.4 million mu.

This year, cotton-producing areas appropriately advanced the cotton sowing period, creating favorable conditions for early-maturing and high-yielding cotton. In the Guanzhong cotton area of ​​Shaanxi Province, due to good soil moisture and high ground temperature, sowing began as early as the end of March, and 80% was sown by mid-April. In the Xiangyang area of Hubei Province, sowing began before the Qingming Festival and was basically completed by the Guyu Festival. In the Neijiang, Suining, and Mianyang areas of Sichuan Province, rainfall was even after mid-April, and 60% to 70% was sown by the end of April, with sowing work basically completed around May 10. Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and southern Shanxi provinces generally started sowing after rainfall in mid-April, generally advancing the sowing period by five to ten days compared to previous years. In Liaoxi Province, due to timely sowing, cotton seedlings generally emerged four or five days earlier than last year. Along with cotton sowing, various places carried out seedling inspection and replanting work in cotton fields. Many provinces inspected, replanted, and re-examined after the sowing was finished. Henan Province has universally carried out a "three inspections and one guarantee" seedling inspection and replanting campaign to check germination, seedling emergence, and soil moisture to ensure full seedlings. Early-sown cotton seedlings already have two or three true leaves and are undergoing inter-tillage, thinning, and transplanting. By May 25, Hebei Province had completed seedling inspection and replanting work in most areas and had shifted to thinning and transplanting.

In order to ensure that cotton production is not reduced due to insect pests and to strive to overfulfill the production plan, various places have prepared or are preparing sufficient pest control agents and sprayers in order to promptly supply cotton farmers to prevent and control cotton pests.

    全国植棉计划超额完成
    【本报讯】经过全国各产棉区各级干部和广大农民的积极努力，今年棉花播种任务已胜利完成。
    据中央农业部的初步统计，全国已播种的棉田，比去年棉花播种面积扩大了六百万亩，已超过全国计划植棉的面积一百多万亩。主要产棉区华北、华东两区都超额完成了植棉计划；中南区虽然没有完成植棉计划，仍比去年扩大了八十多万亩。在各省、市中，河北、江苏、山西、辽东、辽西、浙江、四川等省和北京、天津、旅大等市都完成或超额完成了植棉计划。为争取完成国家植棉计划，河北省在省、专、县各级领导干部带领下，全省先后共动员了一万五千多名干部，深入乡村检查指导春耕播种；各经济部门对棉区供应了大批面粉、大米，并调拨粗粮解决了牲畜饲料问题，鼓励了农民植棉情绪，因此，全省播种棉田一千七百四十万亩，超过计划一百四十万亩。
    今年各产棉区适当提早了棉花播种期，给棉花早熟丰产创造了有利条件。陕西省关中棉区由于墒情好、地温高，最早的三月底开始播种，四月中旬即播种百分之八十。湖北省襄阳专区清明节前开始播种，谷雨节已基本结束。四川省内江、遂宁、绵阳等专区，四月中旬后雨水调匀，至四月底即播种百分之六十至七十，五月十日左右基本结束播种工作。河南、河北、山东及山西省南部，自四月中旬降雨后即普遍开始播种，一般比往年提早播种期五天至十天。辽西省由于适时播种，一般棉田比去年出苗提早了四、五天。各地随着棉花播种，开展了棉田的查苗补苗工作。许多省都是随播种、随检查、随补种，播种结束后再普查一次。河南省普遍开展了查发芽、查出苗、查墒情、保证全苗的“三查一保”的查苗补苗运动，早播种的棉苗已有二、三个真叶，正在进行中耕、间苗、移苗。河北省至五月二十五日大部地区已完成查苗补种工作，转入了间苗移栽。
    为了保证棉花不致因虫害减产，争取超额完成产量计划，各地都准备了或正在准备足够的治虫药剂和喷雾器，以便及时供应棉农防治棉花害虫。
