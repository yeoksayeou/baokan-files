Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th: TASS, London, May 28th: On May 28th, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Yakov Malik, acting on instructions from the Soviet government, presented a statement to the British Deputy Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd, stating:

    According to reports published in the British "Daily Mail" on April 24th and the "Sunday Times" on April 25th, an organization called the "National Alliance of Russian Solidarists" has been established and is active in Britain. The purpose of this organization is to carry out subversive activities and hostile provocations against the Soviet Union. According to the aforementioned newspapers, this organization is recruiting traitors and war criminals, training them, and sending them into the Soviet Union to carry out espionage, sabotage, and terrorist activities. It is perfectly clear from the above reports that this criminal organization is allowed to operate openly in Britain. Therefore, this organization is being protected by the British authorities, and it is being given every opportunity to engage in criminal activities.

    The aforementioned organization, brought to the attention of the British government, is an organization dedicated to subversion and hostility towards the Soviet Union. The existence and activities of such an organization in Britain cannot be considered compatible with normal relations between the two countries. The actions of the British authorities in this matter can only be considered interference in the internal affairs of another country. I draw the British government's attention to the above facts and trust that the British government will immediately take the necessary measures to stop the activities of the aforementioned subversive organization, which is hostile to the Soviet Union and hinders the normal development of relations between our two countries.

    马立克要求英政府制止英境反苏组织活动
   【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：五月二十八日，苏联驻英国大使雅·马立克奉苏联政府的指示，向英国外交副大臣塞尔温·劳埃德提出一项声明，声明称：
    据四月二十四日英国“每日邮报”和四月二十五日“星期日泰晤士报”所刊载的消息，一个名为“俄国团结者全国协会”的组织已在英国境内建立，并且进行活动。这个组织的目的是对苏联进行阴谋破坏和敌视的挑衅等工作。据上述报纸报道，这个组织正在搜罗叛国犯和战犯，训练他们，并派他们潜入苏联境内，进行间谍破坏和恐怖工作。从上述报道中可以完全明确地看出，这个犯罪分子们的组织在英国可以公开活动。因此，这个组织是受到英国当局的保护的，它并且得到从事罪恶活动的一切机会。
    向英国政府提出的前述组织，是阴谋破坏和敌视苏联的组织。这种组织在英国境内存在和活动，不能认为是和两国正常关系相容的。英国当局在这件事情上的活动也只能是对他国内政的干涉。我提请英国政府注意上述事实，并相信英国政府将会立即采取必要措施，制止上述敌视苏联和妨碍我们两国正常关系发展的阴谋破坏组织的活动。
