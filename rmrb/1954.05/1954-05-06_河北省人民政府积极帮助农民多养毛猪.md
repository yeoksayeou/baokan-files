The broad masses of farmers in Hebei Province are actively raising pigs to supply meat to urban and rural residents and increase fertilizer sources.

Last year, farmers in Hebei Province raised more than 4.4 million pigs, which played a significant role in supplying meat to urban and rural residents and increasing fertilizer sources. This year, the province will increase pig production by one million. People's governments at all levels require that every household in areas with pig-raising traditions and sufficient feed should raise pigs. In disaster areas and areas with feed shortages, breeding sows should be selected and more piglets should be raised, which can save feed and increase pig reproduction.

In order to support the pig-raising industry in various regions, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has allocated 150 million catties of coarse grains to supply flour mills and tofu workshops that are conducive to pig raising. State-owned food companies are also using the method of pre-paying 20% to 30% of the ordering price to support farmers in buying pigs. Preventing swine fever is an important task to ensure that pigs are raised well. Various regions are educating farmers in various ways, combining manure accumulation with environmental sanitation, and advocating frequent cleaning of pigsties, frequent addition of soil bedding, frequent brushing of pigsty walls, and frequent scalding of pig troughs. Eighteen key counties, including Zhengding, Shunyi, and Changli, are carrying out widespread swine fever vaccination. The province will also select 5,000 to 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives as base points for preventing swine fever. It is expected that one million pigs will be vaccinated this year. Shunyi, Changli, Dingxian and other counties have already vaccinated more than 10,000 pigs.

In the past, farmers mostly used grain when raising pigs. This year, feed sources will be widely developed, and soybean cake, oil cake, bran, wild green grass, wild fruit tree leaves, melons, vegetables, buckwheat flowers, buckwheat leaves, sweet potato leaves, etc. will be used as feed.

    河北省人民政府积极帮助农民多养毛猪
    河北省广大农民积极养猪，以供应城乡居民肉食，增加肥料来源。
    去年河北省农民共养了四百四十多万口猪，对供应城乡居民肉食和增加肥料来源起了很大作用。今年全省将增养一百万口猪。各级人民政府要求在有养猪习惯和饲料不缺的地区，做到家家养猪；在灾区和饲料缺乏的地区，要选留母猪，多养小猪，既可节省饲料，又可使猪多繁殖。
    河北省人民政府为扶植各地的养猪事业，已拨出一亿五千万斤粗粮，供应有利养猪的粉坊、豆腐坊。国营食品公司也正用预付百分之二十到三十订购金的办法，扶植农民买猪。预防猪瘟是保证把猪养好的重要工作，各地正以各种方式教育农民，结合积肥做好环境卫生，提倡勤起圈，勤垫土，勤刷猪圈墙，勤烫猪槽。正定、顺义、昌黎等十八个重点县，正普遍进行猪疫预防注射。全省还选择五千到八千个农业生产合作社，做预防猪疫的基点。预计今年要有一百万口猪受到预防注射。顺义、昌黎、定县等县已注射了一万多口猪。
    过去农民养猪，大都搀用粮食。今年将广泛开辟饲料来源，采用豆饼、油饼、糠秕、野生青草、野果树叶、瓜、菜、荞麦花、荞麦叶、红薯叶等做饲料。
