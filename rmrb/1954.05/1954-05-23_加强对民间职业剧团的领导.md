    Strengthen Leadership over Non-governmental Professional Theater Troupes
    The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has issued instructions on strengthening the leadership and management of non-governmental professional theater troupes. This instruction points out the direction of efforts for non-governmental professional theater troupes and emphasizes the leadership responsibility of cultural departments of governments at all levels for non-governmental professional theater troupes, which is of positive significance for developing China's drama cause and enabling it to better serve the overall task of the country's transition period.
    At present, the ranks of non-governmental professional theater troupes are very large, connecting with millions of people every day and influencing the spiritual life of the people. In recent years, due to the implementation of the opera reform policy and the improvement of the social status and political awareness of the vast number of artists, the appearance of non-governmental professional theater troupes in various places has undergone great changes; not only have the repertoire and stage image been innovated, but also the internal relations of the troupes have changed. Artists have already broken away from the exploitative relationship of being employed by owners, and most troupes are now cooperatively managed by the artists themselves. Artists have become the masters of their own troupes, rather than being employees or exploited, and therefore they have shown unprecedented enthusiasm and passion in improving opera art and improving troupe management; they want to improve, and they hope that their artistic labor can suit and meet the needs of the new society. But in front of them, there are many difficulties. They demand to perform new repertoires needed by the times, but lack suitable scripts. They demand to reform and improve their performance art, but lack guidance and have to explore on their own. They still lack experience and methods in managing troupes in new ways, for example, in the implementation of remuneration distribution, on the one hand, there is still the phenomenon of individual main actors having excessively high "shares"; on the other hand, there is also a harmful egalitarian tendency to pull the income of main actors to the same level as ordinary actors or close to it. In the implementation of democratic management, on the one hand, there are still remnants of patriarchal style, on the other hand, there is an ultra-democratic tendency, resulting in lax labor discipline and chaotic work order. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that the development of non-governmental professional theater troupes in various places is extremely uneven. There are still many troupes that are owner-operated or disguised owner-operated, with exploitation and other serious unreasonable phenomena. Troupes should be one of the important tools for educating the people, but in their hands, they have become a means of purely making profits. Therefore, the cultural departments at all levels must strengthen the leadership and management of non-governmental professional theater troupes, and on the basis of inspiring artists to be conscious and voluntary, help them to transform and improve the troupes, so that this large artistic propaganda force can play an active role in the country's transition period and help the people actively participate in the great cause of socialist transformation and construction. The improvement plan proposed in the Ministry of Culture's instructions should become the common goal of struggle for non-governmental professional theater troupes across the country.
    Strengthening the leadership and management of non-governmental professional theater troupes cannot simply rely on administrative measures, but must adopt a policy of uniting and educating opera artists, adhere to the principle of relying on the political enthusiasm and artistic creativity of artists in the work, and resolutely correct any ideas and practices among cadres that underestimate artists. For the old styles and habits that remain in the lives and thoughts of artists, it should be recognized that this is the evil consequence left over by the old society, and it is not appropriate to only look at this aspect or even exaggerate this aspect, but at the same time, we should see their progressive and positive aspects and help them gradually overcome their shortcomings with full enthusiasm. As for artistic reform, it is even more necessary to respect the experience accumulated by artists through long-term labor, and resolutely oppose the practice of cadres taking over everything. Opera art is a collective creation passed down from generation to generation by the people, the crystallization of the labor and wisdom of folk artistic geniuses; artists have rich experience in artistic creation and master skilled performing arts and stage techniques. Only under the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" can opera art be further developed on the basis of its original fine traditions by relying on the wisdom and creativity of the vast number of artists. Therefore, the state's opera reform policy must be made the policy of the vast number of artists themselves, and this policy must be implemented by relying on mobilizing and improving the enthusiasm and creativity of the artists. Only in this way can we do a good job in leading and managing non-governmental professional theater troupes and push the opera reform cause forward.
    Strengthening the leadership and management of non-governmental professional theater troupes is a huge and meticulous work, and it cannot be accomplished overnight. First of all, we should seize the link of improving the repertoires performed. Because, if a troupe does not have excellent repertoires, all reforms will become empty talk and will directly affect the existence and development of the troupe itself. Political and professional education for artists, guidance from state-owned theater troupes to non-governmental professional theater troupes, and helping artists establish reasonable management systems and artistic systems should all be carried out around the central task of improving the repertoire. In recent years, the phenomenon of indiscriminate prohibition and alteration of old repertoires has been corrected, and the work of adapting old repertoires and actively promoting excellent repertoires has also achieved remarkable results. In this work, on the one hand, we must continue to oppose the rude attitude towards the national opera heritage, on the other hand, we must also oppose the conservative tendency of being unwilling and unwilling to reform, which has now become the main obstacle to the further progress of the opera reform cause. It should not be forgotten that although China's opera heritage is unusually rich, it also contains many feudal and backward parts. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between good and bad and make choices. New life requires us to create new scripts and new performing arts. We respect and inherit the heritage not only to simply preserve them, but to carry forward and develop them on the basis of inheriting the fine traditions of national art, so that opera art can adapt to the needs of the new era. The meaning of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new" as instructed by Chairman Mao lies here. Otherwise, we will become unpromising people and people who lag behind on the art front. Therefore, we should encourage innovation and reform, and specifically organize forces and artists to cooperate closely, promote the intelligence and talent of artists, conduct various experiments and attempts, create more new scripts that can truly reflect the past and present lives of the people, and gradually innovate stage art from acting, music to stage settings. State-owned opera troupes should play a demonstrative role in opera reform. Unfortunately, some state-owned troupes have played too small a demonstrative role. Cultural departments of governments at all levels should take various ways to strengthen the ideological and political education and professional guidance of artists, and send staff and art cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner to help troupes carry out reforms. Some places have already created some preliminary experiences, such as sending more capable working groups to the troupes in their respective regions in rotation to carry out guidance work for a certain period of time, organizing state-owned troupes to make observation performances to non-governmental professional troupes in a planned manner, and assigning state-owned troupes to establish regular and fixed guidance relations with certain non-governmental professional theater troupes, which are all methods that can be adopted.
    Cultural departments in various places have carried out a lot of work in the leadership and management of non-governmental professional theater troupes, but there are still many places where there is a chaotic state formed due to no leadership or due to multiple leaderships, which is actually no leadership, and this state must be ended. Government cultural departments must register non-governmental professional theater troupes in a planned and step-by-step manner, provide guidance and assistance to their performance activities, and effectively protect their legitimate rights. Illegal and disciplinary violations by individual cadres infringing on the rights of artists must be seriously and conscientiously corrected and dealt with. This is the duty of government cultural departments to the cause of people's drama and the interests of the vast number of artists. Artists should strengthen the idea of serving the people with art, and strive to improve their political and artistic level, and first of all improve their political awareness, so that themselves and their art will not lose their way. The backward ideas such as sectarianism, personal fame and gain left over in the artists from the old society seriously hinder the development of dramatic art and the progress and unity of the artists, and must be overcome. Mutual assistance and cooperation should be promoted, and the noble virtues of the working people should be carried forward. We must abandon the influence of the selfish and self-interested thoughts of the exploiting class, strengthen class friendship, and cultivate collectivist spirit. The conservative tendency in art is also serious among some artists, so it is necessary to strengthen the study of new things, broaden horizons, strengthen unity and cooperation with new literary and art workers, and improve and develop our national traditional opera art on the basis of learning advanced theories and techniques, and resolutely oppose the ideas of complacency and sticking to conventions.
    Strengthening the leadership and management of non-governmental professional theater troupes and further inspiring the conscious voluntariness of artists, so as to promote the opera reform work on the basis of giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of artists, is one of the important measures to implement the overall task of the transition period on the cultural front, and the cultural departments of governments at all levels should work together with all artists to complete this task.

### 加强对民间职业剧团的领导

    加强对民间职业剧团的领导
    中央人民政府文化部发布了关于加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理的指示。这个指示指出了民间职业剧团的努力方向，强调了各级政府文化主管部门对民间职业剧团的领导责任，这对于发展我国戏剧事业，使之更好地服务国家过渡时期的总任务，是有积极意义的。
    目前，民间职业剧团的队伍非常庞大，每天联系着数以百万计的广大群众，影响着人民的精神生活。几年来，由于戏曲改革政策的推行，广大艺人的社会地位和政治觉悟的提高，各地民间职业剧团的面貌发生了很大的变化；不但上演剧目和舞台形象有了革新，剧团内部关系也有了改变。艺人们已经摆脱了受业主雇佣的剥削关系，大多数剧团已由艺人自己合作经营。艺人已成为自己剧团的主人，而不再是被雇佣者、被剥削者，因而他们在改进戏曲艺术和改善剧团经营上表现了前所未有的积极性和热情；他们想上进，他们希望自己的艺术劳动能够适合和满足新社会的需要。但在他们面前，困难是很多的。他们要求排演为时代所需要的新的剧目，但缺乏适合的剧本。他们要求改革和提高自己的表演艺术，但缺少指导，只好自己摸索。他们对于以新的方式经营剧团还缺少经验和办法，例如在实行酬劳分配上，一方面仍有个别主要演员“劈份”过高的现象；另一方面也发生了把主要演员收入拉到和普通演员一般齐或相差无几的有害的平均主义的倾向。在实行民主管理上，一方面仍有家长制的残余作风，另一方面又发生了极端民主化倾向，致使劳动纪律松弛，工作秩序混乱。同时还应指出，各地民间职业剧团的发展是极不平衡的。还有不少剧团仍然是业主班或变相业主班，存在着剥削和其他严重不合理现象。剧团本应是教育人民的重要工具之一，但在他们手中，却成为了单纯牟利的手段。因此，各级文化主管部门必须加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理，在启发艺人自觉自愿的基础上，帮助其对剧团进行改造和提高工作，使这一支庞大的艺术宣传队伍，能在国家过渡时期发挥积极的作用，帮助人民积极参与社会主义改造和建设的伟大事业。文化部指示中所提出的改进方案，应成为全国各地民间职业剧团一致奋斗的目标。
    加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理的工作，不能简单地依靠行政措施，而必须对戏曲艺人采取团结教育的方针，在工作中坚持依靠艺人的政治积极性和艺术创造性的原则，坚决纠正干部中任何轻视艺人的想法和做法。对于艺人生活和思想中残存的旧的作风和习惯，应该认识这是旧社会遗留的恶果，不宜只看这一面甚至夸大这一面，而同时应看到他们进步的积极的方面，抱着满腔热诚去帮助他们逐渐克服他们身上的缺点。至于在艺术改革上，更要尊重艺人长期劳动积累的经验，坚决反对干部包办代替的作法。戏曲艺术是人民世代相传的集体创作，民间艺术天才们的劳动和智慧的结晶；艺人们有着丰富的艺术创作的经验，掌握着熟练的表演艺术和舞台技术。只有在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针之下，依靠广大艺人的智慧和创造才可能使戏曲艺术在原有的优良传统的基础上获得新的进一步的发展。因此，必须使国家戏曲改革的政策成为广大艺人自己的政策，依靠发动和提高艺人的积极性和创造性去执行这个政策。只有这样，才能做好领导和管理民间职业剧团的工作，把戏曲改革事业向前推进一步。
    加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理工作，是一个巨大和细致的工作，不可能一蹴而成。首先应该抓紧改进上演剧目这一环节。因为，如果一个剧团没有优良的剧目，则一切的改革都将成为空谈，且将直接影响剧团本身的存在和发展。对艺人进行政治和业务教育，国家剧团对民间职业剧团的辅导，帮助艺人建立合理的经营管理制度和艺术制度等工作，都应围绕改进剧目这一中心任务来进行。几年来对旧有剧目滥禁滥改的现象已有纠正，改编旧有剧目和积极推广优良剧目的工作也获得了显著的成绩。在这一工作中，一方面要继续反对对待民族戏曲遗产的粗暴态度，另一方面也要反对不愿和不肯改革的保守倾向，这种保守倾向目前已成为戏曲改革事业再前进一步的主要障碍。不应忘记，我国的戏曲遗产虽然异常丰富，但其中也包含了不少封建的和落后的部分。因此，必须区别好坏加以取舍。新的生活要求我们创造新的剧本和新的表演艺术，我们尊重和继承遗产不只是为了简单地保存它们，而是要在继承民族艺术优良传统的基础上加以发扬光大，使戏曲艺术能适应新的时代的需要。毛主席所指示的“推陈出新”的这一意义，就在这里。否则我们就在艺术战线上成了没有出息的人，落伍的人。因此，我们应当鼓励革新和改革，并且具体地组织力量和艺人密切合作，发扬艺人的聪明才智，进行各种实验和尝试，创作出更多的能真实地反映人民过去和现在生活的新的剧本，并使舞台艺术从演技、音乐到舞台装置逐步革新。国营戏曲剧团应当在戏曲改革工作中起应有的示范的作用。可惜，有些国营剧团，这种示范作用起得太小了。各地政府文化主管部门应采取各种方式来加强对艺人的思想政治教育和业务辅导工作，有计划有步骤地派遣工作人员和艺术干部帮助剧团进行改革。有些地方已经创造了一些初步的经验，如派遣较为得力的工作组轮流到所属地区剧团中进行一定时期的辅导工作，组织国营剧团有计划地向民间职业剧团作观摩演出，责成国营剧团和一定民间职业剧团建立经常、固定的辅导关系等，都是可以采用的办法。
    各地文化主管部门在对民间职业剧团的领导和管理上进行了许多工作，但还有不少地方存在着由于无领导或由于多头领导，实际上仍是无领导而形成的混乱状态，这种状态必须结束。政府文化主管部门，必须有计划有步骤地对民间职业剧团加以登记，对其演出活动予以指导和帮助，并切实保障其合法权利。对个别干部侵犯艺人权利的违法乱纪行为，必须严肃地认真地加以纠正和处理。这是政府文化主管部门为了人民戏剧事业和广大艺人的利益应尽的职责。艺人方面则应加强以艺术为人民服务的思想，努力提高自己的政治和艺术水平，首先提高政治觉悟，使自己和自己的艺术不致于迷失方向。旧社会在艺人身上所遗留的宗派门户、个人名利等落后思想，严重妨碍了戏剧艺术的发展和艺人的进步与团结，必须加以克服。应当提倡互助合作，发扬劳动人民的高尚品德。摒弃剥削阶级的自私自利思想的影响，加强阶级友爱，培养集体主义精神。艺术上的保守倾向在一部分艺人中间也是严重的，这就必须加强对新事物的学习，扩大眼界，加强与新文艺工作者的团结和合作，在学习先进理论和技术的基础上来改进和发展我们民族传统的戏曲艺术，坚决反对骄傲自满、墨守成规的思想。
    加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理，进一步启发艺人的自觉自愿，以便在发挥艺人的积极性和创造性的基础上推进戏曲改革工作，这是文化战线上贯彻过渡时期的总任务的重要措施之一，各级政府文化主管部门应和全体艺人共同努力来完成这一任务。
