Shanghai Industrial Production Exhibition Opens

The "Shanghai 1953 Industrial Production Exhibition," sponsored by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, officially opened on May 16th at the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace.

The Industrial Production Exhibition is divided into three sections: "New Products," "Rationalization Proposals and Promotion of Advanced Experience," and "Hall of Honor." The exhibition introduced Shanghai's new achievements in industrial production to the audience through physical objects, models, pictures, and technical demonstrations. These included more than 20 tools improved by Zhu Shunyu, a model worker in the hardware industry; the lathe cutting method improved by Ren Ruihua, a worker at the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant; the sulfathiazole manufacturing method improved by the Shanghai No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory; and the vertical scouring pot automatic cloth swinging machine successfully designed by the State-owned No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory. There were also the main deeds of Shanghai workers in learning and promoting Soviet advanced experience last year, such as small boiling steel, molding sand improvement, and the Kolesov tool method. There were large, precise machines and motors that China could not manufacture in the past, as well as a large number of high-quality textiles and light industrial products made from domestic raw materials. These products not only met the needs of national construction and people's lives, but also showed that Shanghai's industrial technical level is gradually improving, and Shanghai workers' innovative spirit in production.
