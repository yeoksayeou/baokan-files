Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 2nd: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government held a grand cadre meeting in Hohhot on April 30th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of its establishment. Over 1,000 cadres from the Party, government, military, and various people's organizations attended the meeting. Liu Xiufeng, Vice Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, attended and delivered important instructions.

Ulanhu, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, spoke at the meeting.

Liu Xiufeng pointed out in his speech that after Suiyuan Province was incorporated into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, cadres of all nationalities should continue to implement Chairman Mao's great nationality policy, learn from each other, overcome Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, to jointly build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Finally, the conference read a congratulatory telegram from Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, wishing Inner Mongolia greater achievements in its construction. In the evening, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government held a celebration dance.

    内蒙古自治区人民政府纪念成立七周年
    【新华社呼和浩特二日电】内蒙古自治区人民政府成立七周年纪念干部大会四月三十日在呼和浩特隆重举行。到会的有党、政、军和各人民团体干部一千多人。华北行政委员会副主席刘秀峰到会作了重要指示。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫在会上讲话。他指出：七年来，内蒙古各项工作已获得很大成就。自今年一月间撤销绥远省建制，便由推行区域自治进入了建设自治区的新时期。他号召各民族干部更加团结，努力学习马克思列宁主义和党的各项政策方针，发挥集体主义精神和革命积极性，共同建设繁荣的自治区。
    刘秀峰在讲话中指出：绥远省划归内蒙古自治区后，各族干部要继续贯彻毛主席伟大的民族政策，互相学习，克服大汉族主义和狭隘民族主义思想，更紧密地团结在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的周围，共同建设内蒙古自治区。
    大会最后宣读了华北行政委员会主席刘澜涛预祝内蒙古建设获得更大成绩的贺电。晚上，内蒙古自治区人民政府举行了庆祝舞会。
