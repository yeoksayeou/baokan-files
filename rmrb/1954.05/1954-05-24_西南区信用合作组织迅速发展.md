    Credit cooperative organizations in Southwest China have been developing rapidly. By March, the region had 284 credit cooperatives and 726 credit mutual aid groups, a twofold increase compared to the end of last year.
    These credit cooperative organizations have promptly resolved some of the problems of farmers' production and livelihood, and strongly supported spring plowing production. By mid-April, some credit cooperatives in 29 counties and cities, including Dazhou and Zizhong in Sichuan Province, had issued more than 873 million yuan in spring plowing production loans. In Xikang Province, six credit cooperatives loaned more than 730 million yuan during the spring plowing season. In Shizi Township, Bishan County, Sichuan Province, about 500 people often went to the credit cooperative during market days to handle deposits and loans. Because they effectively organized and adjusted rural funds and solved many difficulties for farmers, they were called "small banks" by the masses. The loans issued by the credit cooperative organizations in Xia Yanglang and Da Ying villages in the third district of Chengjiang County, Yunnan Province, helped members add 11 head of cattle and more than 2,000 jin of seeds and rations. With the help of the credit cooperative, farmers in Yinqitun Village, Dongshan Township, Yuxi County, built water conservancy projects to irrigate more than 500 mu of farmland. The loans from the Panjiang and other four credit cooperatives in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, helped 1,083 farmers overcome the spring famine. The development of credit cooperative organizations has effectively cracked down on usury activities. For example, before the opening of the Hantun Credit Cooperative in Bijie County, Guizhou Province, the local usury interest rate exceeded the principal by more than one time. After the credit cooperative started business, usury activities were greatly reduced. In Yongxing Township in the suburbs of Chengdu, 29 farmers who lacked food had to sell green crops, but they were exempted from high-interest exploitation after obtaining loans from the credit cooperative. Credit cooperative organizations in Yiliang and Mouding in Yunnan Province have also signed contact contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to promote the consolidation and development of agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation.

    西南区信用合作组织迅速发展
    西南区信用合作组织迅速发展，到三月份，全区已有二百八十四个信用合作社，七百二十六个信用互助小组，比去年年底增加了一倍。
    这些信用合作组织及时地解决了农民生产、生活上的一些问题，有力地支持了春耕生产。四川省达县、资中等二十九个县、市的部分信用合作社，到四月中旬已发放出八亿七千三百余万元春耕生产贷款。西康省六个信用合作社在春耕时，就贷出七亿三千余万元。四川省璧山县狮子乡在逢场时到信用合作社办理存款放款的，经常在五百人左右。由于有效地组织和调剂了农村资金，解决了农民不少困难，被群众称为“小银行”。云南省澂江县第三区下秧郎和大营两村，信用合作组织发放的贷款，帮助组员增添了耕牛十一头，种籽、口粮两千多斤，玉溪县东山乡尹旗屯村的农民在信用合作社帮助下，兴修水利灌田五百多亩。贵州省贵定县盘江等四个信用合作社的贷款，帮助一千零八十三户农民渡过了春荒，由于信用合作组织的发展，有力地打击了高利贷的活动，如贵州省毕节县汉屯信用合作社未开业前，当地高利贷利息超过本金一倍以上，信用合作社开展业务以后，高利贷活动大大地减少了。成都市郊区永兴乡二十九户缺口粮要卖青苗的农民，得到信用合作社的贷款后，免受了高利剥削。云南省宜良、牟定等地信用合作组织并与农业生产合作社、互助组订立联系合同，促进了农业互助合作的巩固和发展。　（本报西南记者站）
