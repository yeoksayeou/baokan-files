General Construction Organization Design for Basic Construction

Zhao Beike, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

Construction organization design is an advanced and scientific Soviet experience in organizing construction, and it is a guiding document for carrying out construction preparation work and organizing construction. The construction organization design is compiled according to the engineering design documents. Like the engineering design document compilation process, it is also divided into three stages: 1. According to the preliminary design, compile the construction organization condition design; 2. Compile the general construction organization design according to the technical design; 3. Compile the construction operation design according to the construction drawings.

The basic task of the construction organization design is to organize the construction scientifically and reasonably to achieve the overall requirements of "good, fast, economical, and safe." It should gradually and concretely solve the following aspects in the three stages of compilation: 1. Correctly arrange the construction procedure and construction progress; 2. Rational deployment of the construction site; 3. Selection of advanced construction methods; 4. Calculation of the required amount of all resources (manpower, materials) in the construction to ensure technical supply.

In the first year of the construction of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, under the guidance of Soviet experts, we compiled a general construction organization design (combining the first and second stages of design into one) according to the preliminary design and technical design compiled by the Soviet Union, combined with the on-site construction conditions of Anshan Iron and Steel. And based on it, we carried out complex construction preparation work and organized construction. The general construction organization design includes: a general construction schedule, a general construction plan, a design for mechanized and factory construction methods, and a technical supply design.

The general construction schedule is compiled according to the project start and completion deadlines stipulated in the national construction plan, as well as the construction procedures and construction conditions. It should make a comprehensive and thorough arrangement of the start and completion dates, construction procedures, and coordination methods of all projects, in order to organize overall construction.

With a general construction schedule that conforms to the construction procedures and laws, we can grasp the overall situation, determine the key points of construction according to the characteristics and requirements of each construction period, and organize close cooperation between various construction companies. The previous project creates conditions for the next project, and the close connection between the front and back can gradually expand the working surface, organize staggered parallel operations, and achieve the purpose of rapid construction. On the contrary, if we deviate from the guidance of the general construction schedule, lack a comprehensive grasp, lose the key points of construction in each period, and do not distinguish between priorities and urgency, each acting on its own and rushing to complete its own projects, construction chaos, mutual constraints, and delays in construction periods will occur. Because each construction unit is accustomed to starting from its own construction interests, it is willing to complete its own main projects first, and is unwilling to do the minor projects that cooperate with others first. This practice of taking care of each other will inevitably destroy the construction procedures, disrupt the overall progress plan, and delay the overall project progress. For example, when most of the mechanical equipment has been installed, cleaning and adjustment should be carried out immediately, and the civil engineering department is required to quickly complete the ground engineering, roof engineering, plastering, painting, etc., to ensure that the factory building is clean and create good cleaning and adjustment conditions. However, the civil engineering department often has many important projects with large quantities that have not been completed, and is unwilling to devote a large amount of manpower to quickly complete the above-mentioned sporadic projects. Therefore, the mechanical cleaning and adjustment are often delayed, which affects the entire construction period. This deviation from the overall plan is very easy to occur in the construction process, and it is necessary to grasp the overall construction schedule and strengthen control and restraint to prevent it from causing harm.

Secondly, with the general construction schedule, we can organize coordinated construction in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the normal procedures of overall construction. Organizing construction must abide by the objective laws of construction procedures. Each professional project has its own separate construction procedures, and the overall construction of mutual cooperation between each professional project has its own general construction procedures. Construction that conforms to the construction procedures can achieve the purpose of being both stable and fast. Otherwise, if we ignore the overall construction procedures and blindly pursue local progress, those with conditions will start construction first, and those without conditions will start construction later, which is often counterproductive, resulting in program confusion, rework, and delays in the construction period. For example, after the mechanical installation is completed, cleaning and adjustment should be started when cleaning conditions are available. If cleaning is started before the civil engineering ground project is completed in order to catch up with local progress, the cleaned machine will be stained with dust again, and a second cleaning must be carried out. The electrical installation conditions are equally strict. If the civil engineering department has not completed all the main power room and electromagnetic station projects, the electrical installation will start construction, which will also hinder each other and affect the engineering quality of the electrical installation. In construction, each type of work and each process should follow a certain sequence. Which ones can be cross-parallel operations and which ones cannot be cross-parallel operations have their objective laws. Because we lack construction experience, the phenomenon of inverted or disordered processes often occurs, resulting in rework, waste, and prolongation of the construction period. Therefore, each construction unit must carefully study and grasp the laws of construction procedures, and must not only abide by the construction procedures of its own unit, but also abide by the overall construction procedures. Only in this way can the order of construction be guaranteed and the speed of construction be guaranteed.

The general construction plan determines the rational deployment of the construction site. The general plan should rationally divide the construction site into construction sections to arrange construction forces (including labor and construction machinery), divide supply areas, arrange transportation routes to organize technical supply, and ensure that the construction site is coordinated and consistent in an orderly manner. The general construction plan must specifically stipulate: 1. Division of construction sections; 2. Location of temporary substations, air compressor stations, steam boilers, water supply and drainage, etc. for construction; 3. Appropriate location of each auxiliary processing plant, mechanized supply station, material warehouse; 4. Address of temporary offices, worker rest rooms, canteens, toilets, and bathhouses (old buildings should be used as much as possible to save expenses); 5. Division of material stacking areas, equipment unloading areas, and earthwork stacking areas for each construction unit; 6. Planning of various transportation routes, including railway lines, light railways, motor vehicle roads, and loading and unloading places; 7. Construction site safety facilities.

The compilation of the general construction plan should pay special attention to ensuring the continuous expansion of the construction working surface, the exertion of labor efficiency, and the organization of technical supply and the planning of transportation routes that are adapted to it, in order to ensure continuous and expanding construction. The division of the construction working surface and its construction sequence, and the organization of technical supply and the decision of transportation routes are closely related and must be planned comprehensively. Generally speaking, the order of starting work on the working surface should be from the inside to the outside, first the main plant area, then the secondary plant area, and according to its construction sequence, the technical supply methods and transportation routes for each construction section and each period should be determined separately. This is a very complex and precise calculation and organization work. If the consideration is not thorough and the layout is not reasonable, the construction process will be in a passive position and will be forced to solve a series of temporary problems. For example, the material and equipment stacking area should be close to the construction section according to the needs of each construction unit in order to facilitate the supply of construction. If the pre-arrangement is not thorough and the stacking area is small, and the needs of each construction unit cannot be fully met, a chaotic phenomenon of "grabbing the site" will occur; materials are placed everywhere, increasing small-scale transportation in the site, hindering the placement of transportation equipment in the site, and each unit occupies the construction site of other units for its own convenience, hindering the construction of others. The layout of the transportation system is more complicated. Each construction unit must transport materials and equipment at the same time. If the layout is not thorough, the phenomenon of "grabbing routes" will occur, and the problem of work stoppage waiting for materials and equipment will occur. If a frequently used motor vehicle road is a single line, traffic congestion and road blockage often occur, turning the car into a "bullock cart," and it must be changed to a double line or a circular route. As for whether the location of auxiliary processing plants, warehouses, offices, canteens, rest rooms, and toilets is reasonable or not, it will affect labor efficiency and transportation capacity, and should not be arranged casually without consideration.

The general construction plan must be unified and comprehensive to meet the needs of each construction unit and each construction period. The general plan should be compiled by the general contractor, organizing the second contractor to jointly investigate and study, conduct on-site surveys, and not be compiled independently.

The compilation of the general construction plan must be based on the overall enterprise plan. If the temporary and semi-permanent projects for construction violate the overall enterprise plan, conflicts will occur with the permanent projects for plant construction, causing unnecessary waste. After the general construction plan is approved, a strict general plan management system must be established, and no unit is allowed to violate the general plan. (Such as placing materials and equipment in areas that are not in accordance with the regulations, etc.)

Mechanized and factory construction methods are advanced methods that must be adopted for modern large-scale engineering construction. The design of mechanized and factory construction methods must be included in the general construction organization design for prior planning. In the year before the construction of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, under the guidance of Soviet experts, we carried out the design of mechanized and factory construction methods, and prepared to set up a mechanized supply station, a motor vehicle transportation team, a repair shop, a concrete mixing plant, a steel bar plant, a thin plate plant, a woodworking processing plant, a sand mining field, a quarry, a metal structure manufacturing plant, as well as processing plants for electrical installation, industrial pipelines, and industrial furnace construction, and pre-assembly yards for mechanical installation. These mechanized stations and processing plants have played a major role in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel in the past two years. Without this strong technical and material force, it would be difficult to imagine the rapid completion of the huge-scale engineering construction.

The technical supply design of the general construction organization design should make more accurate calculations of labor, materials, electricity, compressed air, water, transportation capacity, etc., as the basis for construction preparation.

The general construction organization design is a guiding document that must be compiled before carrying out any major or large-scale engineering construction. Without the general construction organization design, it is impossible to carry out thorough construction preparation work, and it is impossible to organize construction scientifically and rationally, which will cause various chaos and waste. Therefore, it should be concluded that without the general construction organization design, construction should not be carried out rashly. Before construction, experienced design and construction personnel must be absorbed to compile a comprehensive, unified, thorough, and carefully calculated general construction organization design. Once the general construction organization design is reviewed and approved, it has legal effect and becomes the standard for organizing construction, and no practice that violates the general construction organization design is allowed.

    基本建设的施工组织总设计
    鞍山钢铁公司副经理　赵北克
    施工组织设计是苏联组织施工的先进的科学经验，是进行施工准备工作和组织施工的指导文件。施工组织设计是根据工程设计书编制的，它和工程设计书的编制过程一样，也分为三个阶段：一、根据初步设计，编制施工组织条件设计；二、根据技术设计编制施工组织总设计；三、根据施工图，编制施工作业设计。
    施工组织设计的基本任务是要科学地合理地组织施工，以达到“好、快、省、安全”的全面要求。它要在三个阶段编制过程中逐步地具体地解决下列几方面的问题：一、正确地安排施工程序与施工进度；二、施工现场合理部署；三、选定先进的施工方法；四、计算施工中一切资源（人力、物力）的需要量，以便保证技术供应。
    大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂建设的头一年，我们即在苏联专家的指导下，根据苏联编制的初步设计与技术设计，结合鞍钢现场施工条件，编制了施工组织总设计（将第一二阶段的设计合并为一）。并依据它进行了复杂的施工准备工作与组织施工。施工组织总设计包括：施工总进度表，施工总平面图，机械化、工厂化施工方法的设计和技术供应设计。
    施工总进度表是根据国家建设计划规定的工程开工和竣工期限以及施工程序与施工条件编制的，它要把全部工程的开工竣工日期、施工程序和配合方法，作全面地、周密地安排，以便组织总体施工。
    有了符合于施工程序与规律的施工总进度表，就可以掌握全局，有计划地根据施工各个时期的特点与要求，确定施工重点，组织各工程公司密切配合，使前一工程为后一工程创造条件，前后密切衔接的施工，就能逐步地扩大工作面，组织交错平行作业，达到快速施工的目的。相反的，如果离开了施工总进度表的指导，缺乏全面掌握，失掉了各个时期的施工重点，不分轻重缓急，各自为政，各赶各的工程，就要发生施工混乱、相互牵制、延误工期的错误。因为各个施工单位都习惯于从本单位的施工利益出发，愿意首先完成自己的主要工程，而不愿意先做配合别人的次要工程。这样各顾各的做法，必将破坏施工程序，打乱总进度计划，而使总体工程进度拖延。例如机械设备大部分安装完毕，就应该立即进行清洗调整，要求土建部门迅速把地面工程、屋面工程、粉刷、油漆等做完，保证厂房整洁，创造好清洗调整条件。但土建部门往往还有很多重要的、数量上又是很大的工程未做完，不愿意拿出大的力量迅速完成上述零星工程。因此往往使机械清洗调整拖后，从而影响整个工期拖后。这种脱离总体计划轨道的偏向，在施工过程中是很容易发生的，必须掌握总施工进度计划，加强控制与约束，使其不得为害。
    其次，有了施工总进度表，就可以按照总体施工的正常程序，有计划、有步骤地组织协同施工。组织施工必须遵守施工程序的客观规律，各个专业工程有其单独的施工程序，各专业工程相互配合的总体施工有其总的施工程序。符合于施工程序的施工，就可以达到既稳且快的目的。否则，如果不顾总的施工程序，盲目地追求局部进度，有条件的就先施工，没有条件的就后施工，往往是得不偿失，造成程序错乱、返工与拖延工期的后果。例如机械安装完了，应该在具备清洗条件时开始清洗调整，假如为了追赶局部进度，在土建地面工程还未完了即开始清洗，结果清洗完了的机器又沾上了灰尘，必将返工进行二次清洗。电气安装条件同样严格，假如土建部门还未把主电室、电磁站工程全部做完，电气安装即开始施工，同样要互相妨碍并影响电气安装的工程质量。在施工中，各个工种、各个工序都应该按照一定的先后顺序。何者能交错平行作业，何者不能交错平行作业，都有其客观规律。由于我们缺乏施工经验，往往发生工序颠倒或工序错乱的现象，结果造成返工浪费并延长了工期。因此各施工单位都须仔细研究与掌握施工程序的规律，不仅要遵守本单位的施工程序，还要遵守总体施工程序。只有这样，才能保证施工的秩序，保证建设的速度。
    施工总平面图决定着施工现场的合理部署，总平面图要在施工现场内合理地划分施工工段，以安排施工力量（包括劳动力和施工机械），划分供应地区，安排运输路线以组织技术供应，保证施工现场有秩序地协同一致地施工。施工总平面图要具体规定：一、施工工段的划分；二、施工用临时变电所、空气压缩机站、蒸汽锅炉、上下水道等位置；三、各附属加工厂、机械化供应站、材料仓库的适当位置；四、临时办公室、工人休息室、食堂、厕所、浴池的地址，（应尽可能利用旧有建筑物以节约开支）；五、划分各施工单位材料堆积地区，设备卸放地区，土方堆置地区等；六、规划各种运输路线，包括铁路线、轻便小铁路、汽车路以及装卸场所；七、工地安全设施。
    施工总平面图的编制，应该特别注意保证施工工作面的不断扩大，劳动效率的发挥，以及与之相适应的技术供应的组织和运输路线的规划，以保证连续的不断扩大的施工。划分施工工作面及其施工先后顺序，和组织技术供应、决定运输路线有密切关系，必须通盘筹划。一般的说，工作面的开工次序，应该是先里后外，先主要厂区，后次要厂区，并按其施工顺序，分别确定各施工工段与各个时期的技术供应方法与运输路线，这是十分复杂的精细的计算与组织工作，如果考虑不周密，布置不合理，在施工过程中，就要陷于被动，就要被迫解决一连串的临时问题。例如，材料和设备堆放地区，应该根据各施工单位的需要，靠近施工工段，以便于供应施工。如果事先布置不周，堆放地区狭小，对各施工单位的需要不能全部满足，就要产生“抢地盘”的混乱现象；材料到处放，增加场内小运搬，妨碍场内运输设备放置，各为自己方便占用别的单位的施工场所，妨碍人家施工。运输系统的布置更为复杂，各个施工单位都要同时运进材料和设备，如果布置不周密，就要发生“抢路线”的现象，发生停工待料与停工待设备的毛病。运输频繁的汽车路，如果采用单线，常常会发生车辆拥挤，道路堵塞，使汽车变成了“牛车”，就必须改用复线或循环路线。至于附属加工厂、仓库、办公室、食堂、休息室、厕所的位置合理与否，都会影响劳动效率，影响运输力量，不应不加考虑，随便安排。
    施工总平面图必须是统一的、全面的，要满足各施工单位和各个施工时期的需要。总平面图应由大包公司为主，组织二包公司共同调查研究，实地勘察，进行编制，不能各自为政，各编各的。
    编制施工总平面图，必须根据企业总平面图。如果违反企业总平面图，施工用的临时工程和半永久性工程，和建厂的永久性工程，就要发生冲突，造成不应有的浪费。施工总平面图批准后，就必须建立严格的总图管理制度，不准许任何单位违反总平面图。（如不按照规定地区放置材料设备等。）
    机械化与工厂化的施工方法，是进行现代化的巨大规模的工程建设所必须采用的先进的方法，施工组织总设计中必须有机械化与工厂化施工方法的设计，以作事先的筹划。我们在大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂施工前一年，即在苏联专家指导下，进行了机械化、工厂化的施工设计，筹设了机械化供应站、汽车运输队、修理厂、混凝土搅拌厂、钢筋厂、薄板厂、木工加工厂、采砂场、采石场、金属结构制造厂、以及电气安装、工业管道、工业筑炉的加工厂和机械安装的预装配场等。这些机械化站和加工厂在两年来鞍钢建设上发挥了重大的作用，没有这支强大的技术物质力量，要想迅速地完成规模巨大的工程建设是很难想像的。
    施工组织总设计的技术供应设计应对劳动力、材料、电力、压缩空气、水、运输力等，作出比较准确的计算，作为施工准备的根据。
    施工组织总设计是进行任何重大或较大工程建设之先所必须编制的指导文件，没有施工组织总设计，就无法进行周密的施工准备工作，就不可能科学地、合理地组织施工，就会造成种种混乱和浪费现象。因此应该得出结论：没有施工组织总设计，不应草率施工，施工前必须吸收有经验的设计与施工人员，编制全面的、统一的、周密的、经过精细计算的施工组织总设计。施工组织总设计一经审查批准，就具有法律的效力，成为组织施工的准绳，不允许任何违反施工组织总设计的做法。
