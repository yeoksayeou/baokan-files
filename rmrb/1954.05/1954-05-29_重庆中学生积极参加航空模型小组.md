Xinhua News Agency report:

    Aeromodelling has become one of the most popular extracurricular activities for middle school students in Chongqing. Currently, twenty-four middle schools in the city have organized aeromodelling groups. More than seven hundred and seventy students participate in and persist in the production and research of aeromodels.

    Aeromodelling is an educational activity that can stimulate young people and teenagers' interest in exploring aviation science. Most members of the aeromodelling groups in Chongqing's middle schools have made catapult model aircraft, primary towline model aircraft, and rubber-powered model aircraft. Some members have also made various advanced fuselage model aircraft and piston engine model aircraft.

    Many school aeromodelling group members have also designed and manufactured various new model aircraft according to the principles of flight. The catapult model aircraft made by Wang Zicheng, a student at Chongqing No. 13 Middle School, has a flight time of six minutes and nineteen seconds. The towline model aircraft manufactured by the Chongqing No. 3 Middle School aeromodelling group created an excellent record of being able to fly for nineteen minutes within sight. Some school aeromodelling group members have also manufactured simple wind vanes for their self-made model aircraft. Some group members use model aircraft to perform "aircraft locust eradication" and "parachuting." The aeromodelling group members of Chongqing No. 1 Normal School are designing a piston engine model aircraft controlled by radio. The "Yakolev" glider group, formed by the Chongqing No. 3 Middle School aeromodelling group, is starting to trial-produce an intermediate glider.

    After the aeromodelling movement was launched in schools, it not only enriched the students' scientific knowledge but also enabled them to acquire some labor skills in using simple tools. In order to design or manufacture a satisfactory model aircraft, they must understand the principles of flight and simple knowledge of aircraft structure, and also learn to use tools, understand the properties of wood, and learn to draw. When manufacturing piston engine model aircraft, they must learn the principles of internal combustion engines; when designing and manufacturing radio-controlled model aircraft, they must also study radio science. Members of the Chongqing No. 3 Middle School aeromodelling group once asked carpenters to teach them the techniques and operation methods of sawing and planing wood. The aeromodelling group members also often educate themselves with books such as "Long Sky Angry Wind" and the examples of Zhang Jiuhui and Zhao Baotong, heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, and Ivan Kozhedub, a hero of the Soviet Air Force. They are all students in school who work hard to study their lessons, exercise their bodies, and love the aviation industry.

    重庆中学生积极参加航空模型小组
    航空模型运动已成为重庆市各中等学校学生最喜爱的课外活动之一。现在全市已有二十四所中等学校组织了航空模型小组。有七百七十多个学生参加并坚持了航空模型的制作、研究工作。
    航空模型运动是一项富有教育意义的活动，能引起青年和少年学生们探索航空科学的兴趣。重庆市中等学校中的大多数航空模型小组的组员都已制成了弹射模型飞机、初级牵引模型飞机和橡筋动力模型飞机，部分组员还制造了各种较高级的舱身模型飞机和活塞式发动机模型飞机。
    许多学校的航空模型小组的组员，还按照飞行原理设计和制造了各式各样的新式模型飞机。重庆市第十三中学学生王自诚制作的弹射模型飞机，飞行时间已达到六分十九秒。重庆市第三中学航空模型组制造的牵引模型飞机，创造了在视线内能飞行十九分钟的优异纪录。有些学校的航空模型小组的组员还为自制的模型飞机制造了简单的风向仪。有的组员用模型飞机表演“飞机灭蝗”和“跳伞”。重庆市第一师范学校的航空模型组组员们，正在设计一架用无线电操纵的活塞式发动机模型飞机。重庆市第三中学航空模型组组成的“雅可福烈夫”滑翔机小组，正在着手试制一架中级滑翔机。
    航空模型运动在学校中开展以后，不仅丰富了学生们的科学知识，并使他们获得了一些使用简单工具的劳动技巧。他们为了设计或制造一架满意的模型飞机，要懂得飞行的原理和飞机结构的简单知识，还要学会使用工具、了解木材的性能和学会绘图等。当制造活塞式发动机模型飞机时，就必须学会内燃机的原理；设计和制作无线电操纵的模型飞机时，也要钻研无线电学。重庆市第三中学航空模型组组员们曾请木工教他们锯、刨木材的技术和操作方法。航空模型小组的组员们还经常以“长空怒风”等书籍以及中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧、赵宝桐和苏联空军英雄伊凡·阔日杜布等的榜样来教育自己。他们在学校中都是努力学习功课、锻炼身体并热爱航空事业的学生。
