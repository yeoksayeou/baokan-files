Good children's literature and art creations are loved by children and easily understood by them, are suitable for children's psychological development, and are ideological and artistic. This kind of children's literature and art has great significance and significant effect on cultivating and educating children. Since the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement, our country's writers and artists have created some children's literary and artistic works. However, in old China, children's literature and art has never received the attention it deserved. Lu Xun, the great mentor of the New Culture Movement, repeatedly called for children's spiritual food and personally translated excellent children's literary works by Soviet writers and other foreign writers. However, under the reactionary rule at that time, these works could only be disseminated in a small scope. On the contrary, a large number of readings harmful to children were popular everywhere. The founding of New China changed this situation. In the past four years, thanks to the care, guidance and encouragement of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, children's literature and art has developed. New children's literary and artistic creations have been welcomed by the majority of children, and have played a role in cultivating children's qualities of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and protecting public property, cultivating children's brave and strong enterprising spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, and the spirit of abiding by discipline, being polite, and unity and mutual assistance. However, it must also be pointed out that the current creation of children's literature and art is not vigorous enough, and it is still far from meeting the growing practical needs of children across the country; in addition, some works have to varying degrees the tendency of being formulaic and conceptual, and even individual works contain incorrect and unhealthy ideological content, which has a negative impact on children. This is what we must overcome in our future efforts, and it will certainly be overcome.

In order to better cultivate and educate the next generation of New China, in order to encourage writers and artists across the country, especially children's literature and art writers, to create more children's literature and art works, and in order to strive for further development and prosperity of children's literature and art, the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children held the National Children's Literature and Art Creation Award for the past four years (October 1, 1949 to December 31, 1953). In mid-May last year, we hired Comrades Ding Ling, Kang Keqing, Ye Shengtao, Fang Yu Yan, Gao Shiqi, Zhang Tianyi, Lü Ji, Guang Weiran, Chen Baichen, Yuan Shuipai, Hua Junwu, Ma Feng, Wei Junyi, Ren Hong, He Yi, Jin Jin, and Li Lilian to form the judging committee, and after formulating the judging criteria and scope and steps, we carried out preliminary and final selections based on the works recommended by all parties, and now the judging committee has finally determined the winning works.

Here, on behalf of tens of millions of children across China, we would like to express our deep respect and gratitude to all literary and art writers who write for children, and sincerely hope that they will continue to create more and better works for children. In addition, there are already eleven kinds of children's newspapers and periodicals in the country, three drama troupes dedicated to children's performances, and the children's departments of the Central and some regional People's Broadcasting Stations are constantly providing children with valuable spiritual food. Some film studios have made excellent films for children. These works have a great educational effect on children. We also express our deep respect and gratitude to them, and sincerely hope that they will serve children more and better in the future.

    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会
    关于四年来全国儿童文艺创作评奖的公告
    好的儿童文艺创作是为儿童所喜爱并为儿童所易于理解的，是适合于儿童心理发展的，是具有思想性和艺术性的。这种儿童文艺作品，对于培养和教育儿童有着重大意义和显著的作用。“五四”新文化运动以后，我国的文学家和艺术家即曾创作了若干儿童文艺作品。但是在旧中国里，儿童文艺始终未曾得到应有的重视，新文化运动的伟大导师鲁迅曾一再地为儿童的精神食粮呼吁过，还亲自翻译了苏联作家及其他外国作家的优秀儿童文学作品。但在当时反动统治下，这类作品只能在不大的范围内传播。相反，却有大量的对儿童有害的读物到处流行。新中国的成立改变了这种情况。四年来，由于中国共产党和人民政府的关怀、指导和鼓励，儿童文艺有了发展，新的儿童文艺创作受到了广大儿童的欢迎，对培养儿童爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的品质，培养儿童勇敢坚强不怕困难的进取心，和守纪律、讲礼貌、团结互助的精神，都起了不少作用。但同时也必须指出：目前儿童文艺的创作还不够旺盛，与全国儿童的日益增长的实际需要相差还很远；另外也有一些作品在不同程度上存在着公式化和概念化的倾向，甚至也有个别作品包含不正确、不健康的思想内容，对儿童起了不良的影响。这是我们在今后努力中必须加以克服的，也是一定会克服的。
    为了更好地培养和教育新中国的下一代，为了鼓励全国的作家和文艺工作者，特别是儿童文艺作家创作更多的儿童文艺作品，为了争取儿童文艺进一步的发展和繁荣，中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会举办了四年来（一九四九年十月一日至一九五三年十二月三十一日）全国儿童文艺创作评奖。在去年五月中，我们聘请了丁玲、康克清、叶圣陶、方与严、高士其、张天翼、吕骥、光未然、陈白尘、袁水拍、华君武、马烽、韦君宜、任虹、贺宜、金近、李丽莲等同志组成了评奖委员会，订出评奖标准和评奖范围及步骤后，根据各方面推荐的作品进行初选、复选，现经评奖委员会最后评定出得奖作品。
    这里，我们谨代表全中国数千万儿童向所有为儿童写作的文艺作家表示深深的敬意和感谢，并恳切地希望他们继续为儿童创作更多更好的作品。此外，全国已有十一种儿童报刊，三个专为儿童演出的剧团，中央及某些地区的人民广播电台的少年儿童部源源不断地供给儿童可贵的精神食粮，有些电影制片厂曾为儿童拍摄过优秀的影片，这些工作，对儿童都有很大的教育作用。我们同样地对他们表示深深的敬意和感谢，恳切地盼望他们今后更多更好地为儿童服务。
