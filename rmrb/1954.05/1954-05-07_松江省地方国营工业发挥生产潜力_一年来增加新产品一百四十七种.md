    State-Owned Industries in Songjiang Province Unleash Production Potential: 147 New Products Added in One Year

    Over the past year, state-owned industries in Songjiang Province have added a total of 147 new products and varieties, 84 of which have been included in this year's production plan and are ready for mass production. The increase in new products will further meet the needs of national construction and people's lives. Six of the seven new products trial-produced by the Songjiang Chemical Plant have completely met international standards in quality and have begun mass production. The superphosphate of lime, a powerful and fast-acting agricultural fertilizer made from animal bones, supplied 2,200 tons to rural areas in the second half of last year alone. The Institute of Physics and Chemistry has successfully trial-produced large-scale high-temperature furnaces and isothermal salt bath furnaces, providing a large number of precision physical and chemical instruments for some key national factories. The canned goods factory has trial-produced various canned meats, vegetables, dairy products, and fruits, which can be supplied to cities as well as some remote areas. Other new products include the "First Five-Year Plan" sewing machine with 285 parts trial-produced by the Experimental Factory, eight kinds of cultural supplies such as pianos, accordions, and violins from the Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory, cigarette paper from the Mudanjiang Paper Mill, sixty-one new varieties of knitwear from the Knitting Factory, more than twenty new drugs (mainly commonly used drugs for rural areas) such as strong Biofermin from the Pharmaceutical Factory, and new Soviet-style wood mortise machines and various specifications of planers and other woodworking machinery from the Mudanjiang Machinery Factory, and particleboard and artificial cement tiles from the Plywood Factory.

    Most of the factories trial-produced and manufactured new products on the basis of existing equipment, with very little state investment. For example, the Songjiang Chemical Plant created more than 10 billion yuan of wealth for the country with an investment of only 700 million yuan for the whole year. At the same time, the factories paid special attention to the use of waste materials, greatly reducing waste and lowering costs. For example, the Plywood Factory and the Match Factory used waste materials to produce particleboard, which not only reduced the waste of raw materials, but also supplied the needs of basic construction projects. The Hulan Match Factory alone produced 6,700 meters of particleboard last year, creating 1.2 billion yuan of wealth for the country. The Knitting Factory used waste materials to make various children's clothing, which not only improved the output rate, but also met the urgent needs of children.

    The Industrial Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government has determined to trial-produce another 96 new products in 1954, including important items such as steel paper for electrical insulation and the textile industry, special printing paper for printing banknotes, tractors, organic fertilizer needed for agricultural production—precipitated calcium carbonate, as well as other commonly used drugs and various daily necessities for rural areas.

    松江省地方国营工业发挥生产潜力
    一年来增加新产品一百四十七种
    松江省地方国营工业一年来共增加了一百四十七种新产品和新品种，其中八十四种已列入今年生产计划，准备大批生产。新产品的增加，将进一步满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。松江化学厂试制的七种新产品，有六种质量完全达到国际标准，并已开始大量生产。用兽骨制成的农业强力速性肥料——过磷酸钙，仅去年下半年即供给农村二千二百吨。理化仪器厂试制成功的大型高温炉、均热盐浴炉等，为一些国家重点工厂提供了大批精密的理化仪器。罐头厂试制的各种肉类、蔬菜、乳品、水果罐头，除供给城市外，还可供应一部分偏僻地区。其他还有实验工厂试制成功的包括二百八十五件部件的“一五”式缝纫机，文教用品厂的钢琴、手风琴、提琴等八种文化用品，牡丹江造纸厂的卷烟纸，针织厂的六十一种新式品种的针织品，制药厂的强力表飞鸣等二十多种新药（主要是农村常用药），牡丹江机械厂的苏联新式木榫机、各种规格的刨床等木工机械，胶合板厂的刨花板、人造水泥瓦等。
    各厂试制和生产新产品，大部分都是在原有设备的基础上进行的，国家投资很少。如松江化学厂全年仅用七亿元的投资，即为国家创造了一百余亿元的财富。同时各厂特别注意利用废材，大大地减少了浪费，降低了成本。如胶合板厂、火柴厂利用废材生产刨花板，不仅减少了原材料的浪费，同时还供应了基本建设工程上的需要，仅呼兰火柴厂去年一年即生产了六千七百公尺刨花板，给国家创造了十二亿元的财富。针织厂利用废料，制成各种儿童服装，不但提高了出品率，而且满足了儿童的迫切需要。
    松江省人民政府工业厅确定在一九五四年内再试制九十六种新产品，其中重要的有：电气绝缘和纺织工业用的钢纸，印制钞票用的特种印刷纸，拖拉牵引机，农业生产上需要的有机肥料——沉淀炭酸钙，以及其他农村常用药、各种日用品等。
