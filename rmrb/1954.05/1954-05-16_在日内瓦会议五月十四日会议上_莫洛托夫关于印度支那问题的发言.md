Comrades, Representatives:

    The Indochina issue is of great international significance. It is precisely for this reason that the issue of restoring peace in Indochina has been brought before the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other relevant countries for discussion.
    Here, some have suggested that we should not touch upon the past history of the issue, avoid discussing political questions, and limit ourselves to studying the military aspects of the Indochina issue, etc. If we follow this path, we may not be able to resolve the tasks before the Geneva Conference at all.
    It is certainly not accidental that the French government took the initiative to submit this issue for discussion at the Geneva Conference. Similarly, it is not accidental that the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States held multiple meetings last year to discuss the Indochina issue without achieving positive results. Because at those meetings, they attempted to avoid the essence of the matter and only wanted to address the Indochina issue with vague words. Clearly, they believed that the remaining issues could be resolved by force. However, the Indochina war has dragged on for an increasingly long time.
    Therefore, the French government only submitted this issue to the Geneva Conference with the participation of the five major powers and other relevant parties because it was in a desperate situation.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Indochina War
    When speaking about Vietnam, Mr. Bidault, the head of the French delegation, said that what is happening in Vietnam is a civil war. But the fact is something else. What is taking place in Vietnam is not a civil war, not a war between two parts of the Vietnamese people, but another type of war.
    Ninety years ago, not only Vietnam, but the entire Indochina fell into French colonial rule. However, since then, much water has flowed under the bridge—the entire world has undergone many important changes, and these changes cannot but affect the situation in Asia, including Indochina.
    Comrade Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, convincingly explained here the course of development in Indochina, which is of great significance to the historical development of the people of Indochina countries and largely determines the actual political situation in Indochina. These events prove that what is taking place in Indochina, especially in Vietnam, is not a civil war. From the French perspective, it is a colonial war; but for the people of Indochina who are fighting to break free from foreign colonial rule and to fight for freedom and independence, it is a national liberation war.
    In 1940, Japanese colonial aggressors replaced the French colonizers in Indochina. The French authorities in Indochina at that time began to collude with the new colonizers, but this situation did not last long. With the victory of the Allied powers against Hitler, defeating German fascism, and then defeating Japanese militarism, the national liberation movement in Indochina unfolded.
    Leading this national liberation movement was the Vietnam Independence League (abbreviated as Viet Minh). In the middle of 1945, the armed forces of the Viet Minh liberated a large part of the country's territory and established a provisional government. On September 2, 1945, the National People's Congress of Vietnam held in Hanoi declared the establishment of the independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by the highly respected Vietnamese people's leader Ho Chi Minh. As a result of the victory of the Vietnamese people in the struggle for their rights and national independence, general elections were held throughout Vietnam in January 1946. Despite various obstacles from external forces, 90 percent of the voters participated in the election. The vast majority of voters who participated in the election voted in favor of the Viet Minh candidates who expressed the will of the Vietnamese people to strive for national independence and freedom.
    In March 1946, the National Assembly was convened and elected the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with Ho Chi Minh elected as the Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The government, which was produced by general election, began to implement some measures to consolidate the national independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and carried out extensive democratic reforms to improve the material welfare of the residents and eliminate the consequences of long-term foreign colonial rule.
    The achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the struggle for its national independence are also manifested in the fact that the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam adopted a truly democratic constitution on November 8, 1946. Among the democratic reforms subsequently implemented throughout the country, a decree on rent reduction and interest rate reduction was promulgated, which is of great significance in the context of Vietnam. These decisions made it possible to raise the living standards of the majority of residents throughout the country, who had been left in poverty and hunger as a result of foreign rule. For the first time in the history of Indochina, laws were passed to protect the rights and interests of the working people. At the same time, a free, universal, and compulsory primary education system was introduced.
    All of this shows that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an emerging country that has embarked on the path of independence and cares about the needs of its own people. This emerging country should and has in fact received the active support of its own people, and the active support of the people of all countries in the world, especially the people of Asian countries who rightly see the victory of the Vietnamese people as their own victory.
    It is useful to revisit some of the things about the Bao Dai government. These things, those who are hostile to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would prefer to leave unmentioned. The fact is that as early as August 25, 1945, just a few days after the transfer of power to the democratic government, Bao Dai, who had collaborated with the Japanese occupiers, abdicated, and in his abdication declaration he said that his twenty years of rule had not brought any benefit to Vietnam. Another fact is that Bao Dai concluded in his abdication declaration that it was necessary to recognize that power had passed to the Democratic Government of Vietnam and called on all sectors of the country to unite and support the democratic government established by the people. These facts are irrefutable. Given the facts, how can it be said that the current Bao Dai government, which is supported by the French occupying authorities, is the legitimate government of Vietnam? These facts prove that the legitimate government of Vietnam is the democratic government established by the National Assembly of Vietnam, which was also recognized by France and has a deep foundation among its people.
    If we want to understand the events that occurred in Indochina after the Second World War, to understand the basis of the lofty prestige and wide influence of the Democratic Government of Vietnam, we cannot forget these facts and similar facts.
    Not long ago, the French government itself recognized this. In 1946, the French government and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed a number of agreements. In these agreements, the new government of Vietnam was recognized as the only legitimate government expressing the will of the Vietnamese people. The Franco-Vietnamese "Preliminary Agreement" of March 6, 1946, can serve as an example. The agreement begins as follows:
        "On one side, the Government of the French Republic, represented by the High Commissioner for France, the Plenipotentiary of the French Republic, Fleet Commander Vice-Admiral Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu, formally entrusted to Mr. de Sainteny as the representative of the High Commissioner;
        "On the other side, the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, represented by Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Minister-Delegate Vu Hong Khanh;
        "The two Contracting Parties agree as follows:
        "(1) The French Government recognizes the Republic of Vietnam as a free state, with its government, parliament, army, and finances, and as a member of the Indochinese Federation and the French Union."
    This agreement also included other clauses regulating Franco-Vietnamese relations.
    In this agreement between the French government and the government of the Republic of Vietnam, there is no mention of "colony" and no mention of the colonial system at all. On the contrary, the first section of this document states that "the French Government recognizes the Republic of Vietnam as a free state."
    Everyone also knows that on September 14, 1946, France and Vietnam jointly declared the "Joint Declaration of the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" on the signing of the Franco-Vietnamese "Temporary Agreement" governing Franco-Vietnamese relations. Marius Moutet, the French Minister of Colonies, signed the above agreement on behalf of the French government, and Ho Chi Minh, the Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government, signed on behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Now it is clear to everyone that the French authorities were not prepared to fulfill these agreements when they signed them with Vietnam. Apparently, these agreements were intended to be used to allow French troops to enter the Indochinese peninsula to restore foreign colonial rule over Indochina.
    If the French government had complied with these agreements between France and Vietnam, there would have been no war between France and Vietnam. However, things did not develop this way. The French government broke these agreements and launched a war against Vietnam, which has led to a colonial war being waged in Indochina for eight years.
    This war is extremely unpopular in France itself, not to mention in other countries. It is known as the "dirty war". This war has brought great misfortune to the French people and has caused the French serious losses in manpower and material resources. Moreover, it is clear that this war will not be won and has no future.
    Expanding the War or Restoring Peace
    The example of the Indochinese people's liberation struggle is of historical significance. It shows that in our time, wherever the masses of people who have suffered colonial oppression have risen to defend their national rights and freedom, it is impossible to force those people to return to their old lives, and it is impossible to suppress national movements with weapons and various violent means.
    It is not accidental that there is no word "colony" in the United Nations Charter, and the colonial system is not recognized. This is a clear difference between the United Nations Charter and the Covenant of the League of Nations. In the Covenant of the League of Nations, which was adopted after the First World War, the use of the words "colony" and "mandated territory" did not seem inappropriate. In the United Nations Charter, the attitude towards this issue is different. This is not to say that the United Nations Charter has declared its advocacy of the abolition of the colonial system, and as everyone knows, this system continues to exist under the indirect support of this international organization. However, the United Nations organization differs from the League of Nations in that it is not responsible for honoring the existence of the colonial system, and this, to a certain extent, reflects the international situation that has formed after the defeat of German fascism and Japanese militarism, the two imperialist aggressive forces.
    After the Second World War, the colonial issue has taken on a different nature than before the war. However, the governments of some countries are unwilling to consider this. But the development of events in Indochina - and not only in Indochina - shows that the national liberation movement in colonies and dependent countries has forced those who stubbornly want to regress to the outdated colonial system and maintain foreign rule over colonies to consider this.
    The representatives of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos attending our meeting have spoken here and tried to convince us that they are satisfied with the kind of independence and rights that the French government has given to their people. But one cannot help but ask, to what extent can their speeches really represent the true will of their own people? In this regard, if the representatives of the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos could express their opinions at our meeting, we would be able to get a more accurate understanding of the situation. It is not too late to invite the representatives of these two countries to express their opinions now.
    The representative of the Bao Dai Vietnamese government has also spoken here. He tried to convince us that the negotiations conducted by their government with the French government are sufficient to guarantee the independence and rights of Vietnam. But none of us know what the basis of these words is. On the other hand, we know that despite the support it receives from the French government, this government only controls a small part of the territory of Vietnam. As for the democratic government of Vietnam, which is supported by the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese democratic organizations, everyone knows how selflessly it has struggled for the democratic rights and national independence of its people.
    We should listen to the words of those who understand the actual situation in Indochina. For example, I might mention Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the Indian Parliament on April 24, in which he expressed the following opinion:
    "The conflict in Indochina, in its origin and fundamental nature, is an anti-colonial revolt and an attempt to deal with this revolt by traditional methods of repression and divide and rule."
    Not long ago, the Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Burma and Ceylon held a meeting in Colombo. In the communiqué of the meeting, it was written that the Prime Ministers of the above five Asian countries "suggested that France should announce at the Geneva Conference that it is steadfastly guaranteed to grant full independence to Indochina".
    Even US Secretary of State Dulles, who has ulterior motives towards Indochina, has had to repeatedly remind the French government publicly to pay attention to its obligations to the independence of Indochina. For example, Dulles said in a broadcast speech on May 7 not long ago, "France should put their intention to give Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia complete independence into practice more." If even US Secretary of State Dulles so clearly hints at the unreality of independence in Indochina now, then it is not difficult to see what practical value there is in what someone is saying here that the issues of the so-called independence and democratic rights of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have been perfectly resolved or are being perfectly resolved by France.
    We have also heard here that the government of Bao Dai Vietnam and the governments of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos represented at this meeting are recognized by thirty-four countries in addition to being recognized by France. In their speeches at this conference, some people have tried their best to emphasize the significance of this foreign - most of which are American countries - recognition. However, it is necessary to carefully study what the true situation of diplomatic recognition of the above three Indochinese authorities is. There is one important fact that, in any case, has not been mentioned. That is, among the countries that have recognized these three governments, it can be said that there are no Asian countries. India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Burma, and even the Philippines are unwilling to recognize these three governments. As for the People's Republic of China, like the Soviet Union and other people's democracies, it has no diplomatic relations with these governments, but has established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is certainly not accidental that Asian countries, which understand the situation in Indochina more clearly than other countries, refuse to deal with the governments of the three Indochinese countries supported by France. In this regard, French Prime Minister Laniel's speech in the French National Assembly on October 27, 1953, is noteworthy. When talking about the political situation in Vietnam, he said, "There is no force within Vietnam that is politically strong enough to compete with Ho Chi Minh's political prestige." It can be clearly seen from these words that even the French government itself does not have a high estimate of those Indochinese regimes that it supports, which were and still are unrelated to the people of Indochina. It can be clearly seen from this how absurd it is to try to portray the achievements of the national liberation movement in Indochina as "external influences", for example, as influences from the People's Republic of China. These absurd and groundless arbitrary statements can only come from the mouths of those who are defending the bankruptcy of the colonial policy that has been clearly revealed, which has not taken into account the growing national consciousness of the people of Indochina.
    Even now, there are still people who advocate continuing the colonial war in Indochina. However, taking into account the current situation, they also see that continuing the war there alone is of no help in solving the Indochina issue. As a result, they are embarking on the dangerous path of plotting to expand the war in Indochina. This plan is a threat to the people of Southeast Asian countries.
    In this regard, one cannot fail to mention the growing danger of the expansion of the Indochina war. The more firmly the people of all countries demand an end to the Indochina war, the more frequently influential groups in the United States talk about the need for the United States to openly armed intervention in the Indochina war. There is currently intensifying search for trumped-up reasons for this intervention. They are particularly careful to avoid the United States being completely isolated in realizing the corresponding new aggressive plans in Asia. We have recently seen that in order to achieve this goal, someone is stubbornly attempting to put together some kind of group with the participation of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and some other countries. Before the Geneva Conference, as the conference approached, this attempt became increasingly obvious. It was none other than the US Secretary of State who clamored to expand the US intervention in the Indochina war on the eve of the Geneva Conference. Now there is talk of establishing another "defense group", although the purpose of doing so is certainly not for the defense of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, or any other country, but to put together a new military group to oppose the national liberation movement of the people of Indochina and Southeast Asia. It is not difficult to see that the establishment of new aggressive groups is also to achieve certain strategic purposes. This means that the United States is establishing new military bases in this region, and this is something that countries whose security is harmed by the plans to establish the above-mentioned military groups and expand the US intervention in Indochina cannot ignore.
    It is said that this newly planned group and the US intervention in Indochina are necessary to protect the people of Southeast Asian countries from some kind of foreign threat. Putting aside the question of where the real threat to the people of these countries and their national independence comes from, it is reasonable to ask whether it is appropriate for someone to claim to be the protector of the people of these countries? Because everyone knows that the people of these countries have not asked the United States to protect them.
    When the people of Southeast Asian countries only want one thing - peace, national independence and freedom - is this act of claiming to be the protector of the people of Southeast Asia not at least too presumptuous?
    As you know, there are behind-the-scenes activities going on now to put together a new aggressive group. The purpose of this group is to unite countries that are interested in maintaining the colonial system and are preparing to expand the war in Asia for this purpose. At the same time as the Geneva Conference is being held, someone is trying to replace the task of restoring peace in Indochina with expanding the war in Southeast Asia. The new aggressive plans currently being drafted by influential groups in the United States are leading to this result, which many people have been talking about recently.
    In recent years, the United States has become increasingly enthusiastic about events in Indochina, trying its best to take a position supporting the colonial regime there. It is only necessary to cite the materials on the economic assistance provided by the United States to France and the Indochinese government related to France in recent years to prove this. The following is the relevant material on this issue in recent years: 314 million US dollars from 1952 to 1953. More than one billion US dollars from 1953 to 1954, which is about four-fifths of the total cost of the Indochina war. In the 1954 to 1955 fiscal year, the total amount of these appropriations reached 1.133 billion US dollars. Originally, everyone knew that the person who pays the piper calls the tune. The United States' ever-increasing appropriations are mainly used to subsidize the colonial war being waged in Indochina. Now it can be said that the United States is directly interfering in the colonial war in Indochina.
    The US intervention in Indochina is now expanding in the form of supplying weapons and military materials, sending military advisors, instructors, experts, etc. This is the main obstacle on the road to restoring peace in Indochina. Moreover, this intervention will lead to the expansion of the scale of military operations in Indochina and all other consequences arising therefrom.
    The above-mentioned intervention also shows that the United States intends to control Indochina in practice. To replace the rule of one country with the colonial rule of another country, the efforts that have been spent are not small.
    In addition, the US intervention in Indochina shows that it intends to cause conflict between the people of Indochina who are fighting for their freedom and independence and the people of other countries in Asia, and use the mutual conflict of the people of Asian countries to achieve its own goals.
    All of this proves that preparations for a new world war are also intensifying in the East. When US Secretary of State explained the significance of these plans of the United States in the Far East on January 13 this year, he said: "From a strategic point of view, the interests of the United States in this region are very closely linked to the so-called coastal island chain. This coastal island chain essentially has two continental bases. In the north, it is continental Korea, and in the south, as we hope, it is Indochina. Between them are islands such as Japan, Ryukyu (including the Okinawa Islands), Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand.
    "The United States has various forms of agreements on guaranteeing the security of each of the above-mentioned regions, and in some cases, it does not appear in the form of a treaty, but it is still a real and true agreement."
    It can be seen from this passage of the US Secretary of State that those who implement the US strategic plans do not care at all about the rights and fate of the people of Indochina or the people of other countries in this region. It can also be seen from another aspect: these US strategic plans, which are preparing to expand the war in this region, are a serious threat to the peaceful development of the people of this entire vast region. It is not clear whether the United States will succeed in putting together a military group with the participation of certain countries to realize its own plans, but these plans clearly contain attempts to support the colonial system in Asia at all costs.
    The Geneva Conference bears a great responsibility in whether it can complete the task of opposing the aggressive plans to expand the war in Southeast Asia. Only by giving a decisive counterattack to this plan will it be in line with the task of the Geneva Conference, the purpose of which in the past and now is to restore peace in Indochina.
    The Road to Restoring Peace in Indochina
    How can it be said to promote the restoration of peace in Indochina? The Geneva Conference cannot understand this task as being able to cleverly arrange an opportunity to turn the cessation of hostilities in Indochina into a respite for one side, so that it can use this opportunity to prepare to expand the war in Indochina. The task of the Geneva Conference should be understood as follows: the Geneva Conference should achieve an early cessation of hostilities in Indochina and at the same time reach an agreement that can satisfy the legitimate demands of the people of Indochina in terms of guaranteeing their national independence and democratic rights.
    The chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward some suggestions here, which provide a basis for solving the Indochina issue and can guarantee the restoration of peace in Indochina. Until now, we have neither heard any well-founded criticisms of these suggestions here, nor have we heard any expressions of acceptance of some of the clauses therein.
    The Soviet delegation believes that, in terms of the most important points of these suggestions, the essence of the suggestions lies in: 1. France should guarantee the recognition of the sovereignty and independence of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. In addition, an agreement should be concluded stipulating that all foreign troops be withdrawn from the territories of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos within a time limit agreed upon by both parties. 2. Free general elections should be held in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, and a unified democratic government should be established in each country based on the results of the general elections. Before the elections, consultation meetings should be held by representatives of both sides of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and freedom of activity should be guaranteed for all patriotic parties and social organizations. 3. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the governments of Cambodia and Laos should express their willingness to study the issue of joining the French Union in accordance with the principle of free will. In addition, the governments of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos should recognize the existing economic and cultural interests of France in these countries and resolve the corresponding issues in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. 4. Before the implementation of the above-mentioned measures and other steps proposed in the draft proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, hostilities should first be stopped in Indochina, and a corresponding agreement should be concluded stipulating that the introduction of new troops, various weapons and ammunition into Indochina from the outside should be completely stopped. In addition to the points I have listed above, agreements must be reached on certain other issues, such as the issue of exchanging prisoners of war and the issue of not prosecuting those who cooperated with the other side during the war. The above four basic points must also appropriately take into account the legitimate wishes of both sides when reaching agreements on political and military issues.
    These goals can be fully achieved if both sides show due desire to establish genuine, solid and lasting peace in Indochina.
    The purpose of the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to reach an agreement with France. These proposals start from the point that it is appropriate to recognize the principle of fairness and honor, according to which it is entirely possible to establish new friendly relations between the people of Indochina and the French people.
    These suggestions may not satisfy those who pursue colonial policies, because they stubbornly cling to outdated and decadent things.
    If they reject this possibility of reaching an agreement on the Indochina issue, then they are not acting in the interests of the nation, but in the interests of those foreign aggressive groups who are keen on expanding the war in Indochina and do not want to restore peace.
    The French delegation presented its proposals for resolving the Indochina issue at our first meeting. During this period, we had the opportunity to carefully study the French plan and the suggestions of other delegations.
    The shortcoming of the French proposal is that it does not touch upon political issues at all. However, everyone knows that to end the protracted Indochina war, at least some of these kinds of issues must be resolved, and the two are inseparable. In the French plan, it can be seen that the national liberation struggles that have unfolded in Laos and Cambodia are underestimated. However, it is not enough to limit the issue of the entire situation in Indochina to the development of the situation in Vietnam.
    In addition, the French proposal also mentions the guarantees for the agreements that will be reached at this meeting. The French proposal says this:
    "The agreements will be guaranteed by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference. In the event of any violation of the agreements, these countries shall immediately consult in order to take appropriate measures individually or collectively."
    The Soviet delegation cannot fully agree with the above suggestion. However, the Soviet delegation believes that the principle of the French suggestion that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should guarantee that the agreements passed at the conference are implemented, and that these countries should consult in the event of any violation of these agreements, is acceptable. The purpose of consultation is to take collective measures to ensure the implementation of these agreements. It is best for others participating in this meeting to also express their attitudes towards this important suggestion of the French delegation.
    It has also been pointed out that the plan put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stipulates that the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement is only supervised by a mixed committee composed of the warring parties in three countries, and it is specifically pointed out that in this way, the plan does not provide for appropriate supervision by certain international organizations.
    Since reaching an agreement on this issue is of great significance, the Soviet delegation suggests that these suggestions be supplemented. We can agree to establish a committee composed of representatives of neutral countries to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement.
    It should be said that there will be no insurmountable difficulties in determining the members of this committee.
    In view of this, the Soviet delegation proposes the following supplement to the above suggestion: "To assist both parties in implementing the terms of the agreement to cease hostilities, the agreement should stipulate the establishment of a neutral country supervisory committee."
    At this Geneva Conference, France is facing a major issue: which path will France choose in Indochina. One path is to continue the Indochina war, thereby expanding the war for foreign aggressive plans, which is of no benefit to the national interests of France. The other path is to consult, first of all with the Vietnamese people, and to continue to work towards this direction to ensure a swift ceasefire and establish peace in Indochina. Taking this path can enable France and the people of Indochina to understand each other and establish friendly relations between them. The Geneva Conference should strive to promote such a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue.
    Of course, the Soviet delegation will express its opinions on all the issues raised by the British representative at the last meeting. However, it can already be said now that it is inappropriate to reduce the matter to only these issues and to let go of some of the military and political issues that have already been raised by the development of the situation in Indochina.
    The Soviet delegation, like the delegation of the People's Republic of China, attaches great importance to the suggestions put forward by the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Soviet delegation expresses its support for these suggestions and hopes that these suggestions will receive due attention. At the same time, the Soviet delegation believes that the Geneva Conference will also study all other suggestions that truly help restore peace in Indochina. The Soviet government believes that resolving the Indochina issue with due consideration to the national interests of the people of Indochina will be an important step not only in the cause of consolidating peace in Asia, but also in the cause of consolidating world peace.

### 在日内瓦会议五月十四日会议上  莫洛托夫关于印度支那问题的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议五月十四日会议上
    莫洛托夫关于印度支那问题的发言代表先生们：
    印度支那问题是具有重大的国际意义的。正因为这样，恢复印度支那和平的问题才被提到日内瓦的法国、英国、美国、中华人民共和国、苏联和其他有关国家的外长会议上来讨论。
    在这里有时有人建议不要触及问题的过去历史，不要讨论政治问题，而仅限于研究印度支那问题的军事方面等等。如果我们顺着这条路走去，我们可能一点也解决不了摆在日内瓦会议面前的任务。
    法国政府主动地把这一问题提交日内瓦会议讨论，当然并不是偶然的。同样，去年法国、英国、美国三国外长曾多次举行会议也讨论印度支那问题而没有取得积极的结果，这种情况也不是偶然的。因为在那些会议上，大家企图避开事情的实质不谈，而只想以泛泛的言词来处理印度支那问题。显然，他们认为，剩下来的事情是可以用武力来解决的。但是印度支那战争却拖得越来越长久了。
    因此，法国政府只是因为处于走头无路的境地才把这个问题提交有五大国代表和其他有关方面参加的日内瓦会议来讨论的。
    越南民主共和国和印度支那战争
    法国代表团团长皮杜尔在谈到越南时说，越南所发生的是内战。但是事实却是另一回事。在越南所进行的不是内战，不是两部分越南人民之间的战争，而是另一种类型的战争。
    九十年前，不仅越南，而是整个印度支那都沦为法国的殖民地。然而，自那时起，很多水从桥下流过去了——整个世界发生了许多重要的变化，这些变化不能不影响到亚洲的情况，其中包括印度支那。
    越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同在这里使人信服地说明了印度支那局势的发展经过，这种经过对印度支那各国人民的历史发展有着非常重要的意义，并大体上确定了印度支那的实际政治情况。这些事件证明：在印度支那，首先是在越南，所进行的不是内战。从法国方面来讲，这是殖民战争，而对于为挣脱外国殖民统治、为争取自由和独立而斗争的印度支那人民来讲，这是民族解放战争。
    一九四零年，日本殖民侵略者代替了在印度支那的法国殖民者。那时的印度支那法国当局开始和新的殖民者勾结，但这种情况没有继续多久。随着反对希特勒的同盟国取得胜利，击溃了德国法西斯主义，并接着打败了日本军国主义，印度支那的民族解放运动展开了。
    领导这一民族解放运动的是越南独立同盟（简称越盟）。一九四五年年中，越盟的武装部队解放了全国很大一部分领土，并建立了临时政府。一九四五年九月二日，在河内举行的越南全国人民代表大会宣告以极孚众望的越南人民领袖胡志明为首的独立的越南民主共和国成立。由于越南人民在为自己的权利和民族独立的斗争中获得了胜利，越南全国于一九四六年一月进行了普选。虽然曾有外力加以种种阻挠，仍有百分之九十的选民参加了这次选举。绝大部分参加选举的选民投票拥护表达了越南人民争取民族独立和自由的意志的越盟候选人。
    一九四六年三月，召开了国民大会，选出了越南民主共和国政府，胡志明当选为越南民主共和国主席。由普选而产生的政府着手实行了一些巩固越南民主共和国的国家独立的措施，并进行广泛的民主改革，以便改进居民的物质福利状况并消灭长期来外国殖民统治的后果。
    越南民主共和国在争取自己的民族独立的斗争中所取得的成就，同时也表现在：越南民主共和国国民大会在一九四六年十一月八日通过了真正民主的宪法。在随后全国实行的民主改革中，颁布了减租减息的法令，这在越南的情况下是有巨大意义的。这些决定使得有可能来提高全国大部分居民的生活水平，外国统治的结果已使他们处于贫困与饥饿的状况。印度支那有史以来第一次通过了保障劳动人民权利和利益的法律。同时，开始实行免费的初等普及义务教育制。
    这一切都说明，越南民主共和国是一个走上独立道路并关心自己人民的需要的新兴国家。这一新兴国家应该会得到而且事实上也已经得到了本国人民的积极支持，得到了世界各国人民、首先是那些把越南人民的胜利正当地看成是自己的胜利的亚洲各国人民的积极支持。
    现在重提一下关于保大政府的一些事情是有益的。这些事情，敌视越南民主共和国的人是宁愿放过不谈的。事实是：早在一九四五年八月二十五日，即政权转到民主政府手中以后没有几天，与日本占领者合作过的保大退位了，他在退位宣告中说，他统治二十年来没有能给越南带来一点好处。另一件事实是：保大在他的退位宣告中得出结论说，必须承认政权已归于越南民主政府，并号召全国各阶层人民均应统一并拥护人民所建立起来的民主政府。这些事实都是不容辩驳的。既然事实如此，那又怎能说法国占领当局所扶植起来的现在的保大政府是合法的越南政府呢？这些事实证明，合法的越南政府是越南国民大会所建立的民主政府，这一政府也曾为法国所承认并在自己的人民中间有深厚的基础。
    如果我们想了解第二次世界大战结束后印度支那所发生的事件，了解越南民主政府崇高的威信和广泛的影响的基础是什么，那就不能忘记这些事实和类似的事实。
    并不很久以前，法国政府自己也承认过这一点。一九四六年间，法国政府和越南民主共和国政府签订了一些协定。在这些协定中，越南新政府被认为是表达越南人民意志的唯一合法政府。一九四六年三月六日的法越“初步协定”就可以作为例证。该协定开头这样说：
      “一方，法兰西共和国政府由法国高级专员，法兰西共和国的全权受有者，舰队司令海军中将乔治·基也利·达尚礼正式委托的高级专员代表圣德尼先生为代表；
    “另一方，越南共和国政府由主席胡志明先生和部长会议特派代表武鸿卿先生为代表；
    “缔约国双方议定如后：
    “（一）法兰西政府承认越南共和国是一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政，并为印度支那联邦和法兰西联邦的一分子。”
    这一协定还包括了其他一些规定法越关系的条款。
    在法国政府和越南的共和国政府之间的这一协定中完全没有“殖民地”的字样，也完全没有提到殖民制度。相反，这个文件的第一节就说，“法兰西政府承认越南共和国是一个自由的国家。”
    大家也都知道，一九四六年九月十四日，法国和越南就签订规定法越关系的法越“临时协定”一事公布了“法兰西共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府共同宣言”。代表法国政府在上述协定上签字的是法国殖民部部长马里尤斯·莫戴，代表越南民主共和国政府签字的是越南民主共和国政府主席胡志明。
    现在大家都很明了，法国当局在和越南签订这些协定的时候是不准备履行的。显然，这些协定是被打算利用来使法国军队开入印度支那半岛境内，以恢复外国对印度支那的殖民统治。
    如果法国政府遵守了法国和越南之间的这些协定，那么，法国和越南之间就不致发生任何战争。然而，事情的发展却不是这样。法国政府破坏了这些协定，发动了对越南的战争，以致八年来一直在印度支那进行着殖民战争。
    这个战争在法国本国就极不得人心，更不用谈在其他国家了。它是以“肮脏战争”著名的。这个战争替法国人民带来了巨大的不幸，使法国人遭到严重的人力和物力的损失。而且，很明显，这个战争是不会得到胜利的，是没有前途的。
    扩大战争还是恢复和平
    印度支那人民解放斗争的范例是具有历史意义的。它表明：在我们这个时代里，无论在什么地方，只要曾经遭受殖民压迫的人民群众已经起来保卫自己的民族权利和自由，那就不可能迫使那里的人民重过旧日的生活，不可能用武器和种种暴力手段来镇压民族运动了。
    联合国宪章中没有“殖民地”字样，没有承认殖民制度，这不是偶然的。这是联合国宪章和国际联盟盟约显然不同之处。在第一次世界大战以后所通过的国际联盟盟约中在使用“殖民地”和“托管领土”这些字眼时，并不感到不合式。在联合国宪章中，对这一问题的态度有所不同。这并不是说，联合国宪章已经宣布主张消灭殖民制度，大家知道，这一制度在这一国际组织的间接支持下还继续存在。但是，联合国组织不同于国际联盟的是：它不负有尊崇殖民制度的存在的责任，因而这在一定程度上就反映了在德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义这两个帝国主义侵略势力被击溃后所形成的国际局势。
    在第二次世界大战以后，殖民地问题已经具有和这次战争以前不同的性质。然而，某些国家的政府还不愿考虑这一点。可是印度支那事件的发展——而且还不仅是印度支那——说明，殖民地与附属国的民族解放运动已经迫使那些固执地想倒退向陈腐的殖民制度和维持殖民地的外国统治的人加以考虑。
    出席我们这一会议的高棉王国和寮国王国的代表在这里发言并企图叫我们相信，他们对法国政府给予他们人民的那种独立和权利表示满意。但是人们不禁要问，他们的发言到底能够在多大程度上代表他们本国人民的真正意志呢？在这方面，如果有高棉和寮国两国人民的抗战政府的代表在我们的会议上表示意见，那我们就能对情况得到比较正确的了解，现在邀请这两国的代表来表示意见还不算太晚。
    越南保大政府的代表也在这里发言了。他企图叫我们相信，他们那个政府和法国政府所进行的谈判足以保障越南的独立和权利。但是我们谁也不知道，这些话的根据是什么。另一方面，我们知道，尽管法国政府给予它以支持，但是这一政府还是仅仅控制了越南的一小部分领土。至于谈到为越南人民和越南民主组织所拥护的越南民主政府，则大家都知道，它是如何忘我地为自己人民的民主权利和民族独立而奋斗的。
    我们应该听听那些了解印度支那实际局势的人的话。例如，我不妨提一下印度总理尼赫鲁四月二十四日在印度国会的发言，他在发言中表示了下述意见：
    “印度支那冲突就其起源和基本性质来说，乃是反殖民主义的反抗运动，以及用传统的镇压及分而治之的方法对付这一反抗的企图。”
    不久以前，印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰五国总理在科伦坡举行会议。在会议公报中写道，上述五个亚洲国家的总理们“建议：法国应在日内瓦会议上宣布，它坚定不移地保证给予印度支那完全独立”。
    甚至于对印度支那别有用心的美国国务卿杜勒斯也不得不一再地公开提醒法国政府，要它注意它对印度支那独立的义务。例如，不久以前，杜勒斯在五月七日的广播演说中说，“法国应该把他们给越南、寮国和高棉以完全独立的意图更多地付诸实现。”假如，连美国国务卿杜勒斯都这样明显地暗示到现在印度支那独立的不真实性，那就不难看出，这里有人所说的什么越南、高棉和寮国的独立和民主权利的问题已经由法国完满地加以解决或者正在圆满地加以解决的说法，到底有什么实际价值了。
    我们在这里也听说，保大越南政府和出席此间会议的高棉王国和寮国王国的代表的政府，除了为法国所承认外，还为三十四个国家所承认。在我们这次会议上，有些人在发言中尽力强调这种外国——其中多数都是一些美洲国家——承认的意义。可是，必须仔细地研究一下，对上述三个印度支那国家当局的外交承认的真正情况究竟怎样。有一件重要的事实，不管怎样至少没有被提到。这就是，在承认了这三个政府的国家中，可以说是没有亚洲国家。印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、缅甸、甚至于菲律宾都不愿意承认这三个政府。至于中华人民共和国，它与苏联和其他人民民主国家一样，与这些政府是没有外交关系的，而是与越南民主共和国建立外交关系的。比其他国家更清楚地了解印度支那的局势的亚洲国家拒绝与法国所支持的三个印度支那国家的政府打交道，这当然并不是偶然的。关于这一方面，法国总理拉尼埃于一九五三年十月二十七日在法国国民议会上的发言是值得注意的。他在谈到越南的政治情况时说，“在越南内部还没有什么力量足以在政治上与胡志明的政治威望相抗衡的。”从这些话中可以清楚地看出，连法国政府本身对它所支持的那些印度支那政权的估价都不高，这些政权过去是、现在仍然是与印度支那人民毫不相干的。由此就可以清楚地看出，企图把印度支那的民族解放运动的成就说成是“外界的影响”，譬如说，说成是中华人民共和国方面的影响，这是多么的荒谬。这些荒唐无稽的武断说法只能出自这样一些人的口里，他们正为已经明显地表露出来的殖民政策的破产辩护，这种政策没有估计到印度支那人民日益增长的民族自觉性。
    即使现在也还有人主张继续进行印度支那的殖民战争。可是，考虑到目前的局势，他们也都看到，仅仅在那里继续进行战争是对解决印度支那问题毫无帮助的。结果他们就走上危险的道路，策划扩大印度支那战争。这种计划对东南亚各国人民是一种威胁。
    在这方面，不能不提到印度支那战争扩大的危险日益增长的事实。各国人民要求结束印度支那战争愈是坚决，美国有势力的集团也就愈加频繁地谈到美国必须公开武装干涉印度支那战争。目前正在加紧为这种干涉寻找莫须有的理由。他们特别小心翼翼地注意避免美国在实现相应的在亚洲的新侵略计划时完全陷于孤立。我们最近已经看到，为了达到这种目的，有人在顽固地企图拼凑有美国、法国、英国以及其他一些国家参加的某种集团。在日内瓦会议前，随着会议的日益逼近，这种企图也就日益明显。在日内瓦会议前夕大嚷要扩大美国对印度支那战争的干涉的不是别人，正是美国的国务卿。现在又在谈建立另一个“防务集团”了，虽然，这样干的目的也当然完全不是为了美国、法国、英国或其他某一别的国家的防务，而是为了拼凑新的军事集团来反对印度支那和东南亚各国人民的民族解放运动。不难看出，建立新的侵略集团也是为了达到某些战略目的。这意味着美国在这一地区建立新的军事基地，而这是那些因建立上述军事集团和扩大美国对印度支那的干涉的计划而安全遭到侵害的国家所不能置之不理的。
    据说，新近策划的这个集团以及美国干涉印度支那之所以成为必要，是为了保护东南亚各国人民反对某种外来的威胁。姑且不谈对这些国家的人民和他们的民族独立的真正威胁是从何而来的罢，合理地试问一句，自命为这些国家人民的保护者是不是合适的呢？因为大家知道，这些国家的人民并没有请美国来保护他们呀。
    当东南亚各国人民只希望一种东西——和平、民族独立和自由的时候，这种自命为东南亚人民的保护者的角色的行为是不是至少可以说是太放肆了呢？
    你们知道，现在正在进行着拼凑一个新侵略集团的幕后活动。这一集团的目的是：联合对维持殖民制度有兴趣的国家，并准备为此而在亚洲扩大战争。就在日内瓦会议举行的同时，有人正企图用在东南亚扩大战争来代替在印度支那恢复和平的任务。美国有势力的集团目前正在拟制的新的侵略计划，就是导向这种（扩大东南亚战争的）结果的，最近时期，许多人都在对这议论纷纷。
    最近几年中，美国日益热中于印度支那事件，竭力采取支持那里的殖民政权的态度。只须引述最近几年来美国给予法国和与法国有关的印度支那政府的经济援助的材料，就可以证明这一点。下面就是最近几年中关于这一问题的有关材料：一九五二年到一九五三年是三亿一千四百万美元。一九五三年到一九五四年是十亿美元以上，这个数目约为印度支那战争全部费用的五分之四。一九五四年到一九五五年财政年度，这些拨款总数达十一亿三千三百万美元。本来，大家都知道，出钱的老爷点什么曲子就唱什么歌。美国的不断增加的拨款，主要是用在资助在印度支那进行的殖民战争的。现在已可以说美国直接干涉印度支那殖民战争了。
    美国对印度支那的干涉，现在还以供给武器和军用物资、派遣军事顾问、教官、专家等的形式而不断扩大。这是恢复印度支那和平的道路上的主要障碍。而且，这种干涉将导致印度支那军事行动规模的扩大以及由此而产生的一切其他后果。
    上述的干涉还表明，美国打算在实际上控制印度支那。为了以另外一个国家的殖民统治来代替一个国家的统治，已经花了的气力是不小的。
    除此之外，美国对印度支那事务的干涉表明，它打算使争取自己自由和独立而斗争的印度支那人民和亚洲其他国家的人民发生冲突，并利用亚洲各国人民的相互冲突来达到自己的目的。
    所有这一切证明，对于新的世界大战的准备也在东方加紧进行着。今年一月十三日美国国务卿在解释美国在远东的这些计划意义时说过：“以战略观点来看，美国在这一地区的利益与所谓沿岸岛屿链锁是非常紧密地联系着的。这个沿岸岛屿链锁实质上有两个大陆基地。在北部为大陆的朝鲜，在南部，如我们所希望的，是印度支那。它们之间有着这样一些岛屿：日本、琉球（包括冲绳群岛）、台湾、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰。
    “美国有着各种形式的关于保证每一上述地区安全的协议，在某些情况下，它并不以条约形式出现，然而仍然是现实的、千真万确的协议。”
    从美国国务卿的这一段话中可看出，执行美国战略计划的那些人是决不关心印度支那人民或是这一地区其他国家人民的权利和命运的。从另一方面也可看出：准备在这一地区扩大战争的这些美国战略计划，对这整个广大地区人民的和平发展是一个严重的威胁。美国为了实现自己的计划而拼凑有某些国家参加的军事集团能否成功还不清楚，但是这些计划显然包含着不择手段地支持亚洲殖民制度的企图。
    日内瓦会议在它是否能完成反对在东南亚扩大战争的侵略计划这一任务上负有重大的责任。只有给这一计划一个决定性的反击才符合日内瓦会议的任务，日内瓦会议的目的过去和现在都是恢复印度支那和平。
    恢复印度支那和平的道路
    怎样才算是促进恢复印度支那和平呢？日内瓦会议不能把这一任务作这样的理解：可以把停止印度支那敌对行动变成了希望给一方的喘息狡猾地按排机会，使它利用这个机会来准备扩大印度支那战争。对于日内瓦会议的任务应当作这样的理解：日内瓦会议应当获得早日停止印度支那的敌对行动，并同时达成一个使印度支那人民在保障他们的民族独立和民主权利方面的合法要求能够得到满足的协议。
    越南民主共和国代表团首席代表在这里提出了一些建议，这些建议为解决印度支那问题提供了基础，并能保证恢复印度支那和平。直到现在，我们在这里既没有听到对这些建议有过什么有根据的批评，也没有听到表示接受其中的某些条款。
    苏联代表团认为，就这些建议的最重要几点来看，建议的实质在于：一、法国应保证承认越南、高棉和寮国的主权与独立。此外，应缔结协定，规定在双方同意的时限内，自越南、高棉与寮国领土上撤退一切外国军队。二、在越南、高棉与寮国举行自由普选，根据普选的结果在各该国内建立一个统一的民主政府。在选举前应由越南、高棉、寮国各国双方代表举行协商会议，并保证各爱国党派与社会团体的活动自由。三、越南民主共和国政府和高棉及寮国政府应表示愿意研究各该国依照自由意志的原则加入法兰西联邦的问题。此外，越南、高棉和寮国政府应承认法国在这些国家内现存的经济与文化上的利益，并根据平等与互利的原则解决相应的问题。四、在执行上述措施以及越南民主共和国建议案中提出的其他步骤以前，应该先在印度支那停止敌对行动，并缔结相应的协定，规定完全停止从外面把新的部队、各种武器和弹药运入印度支那。除了我上面列举的几点以外，必须就某些其他问题达成协议，如：交换战俘问题，不得对在战争期间和另一方合作的人起诉的问题等。上述四个基本点还必须适当照顾双方就政治问题与军事问题达成协议时的合法愿望。
    如果双方对在印度支那建立真正巩固和持久的和平表现出应有的愿望，这些目的是完全可以达到的。
    越南民主共和国的建议的目的在与法国达成协议。这些建议的出发点是：互相承认公平与光荣的原则是合宜的，根据这种原则，印度支那人民和法国人民之间完全可能建立起新的友好关系。
    这些建议可能不会使奉行殖民政策的人感到满意，因为他们死抱住过时腐朽的东西不放。
    如果他们拒绝了这种就印度支那问题达成协议的可能性，那么，他们就不是为了民族的利益，而是为了那些热中于在印度支那扩大战争，不想恢复和平的外国侵略集团的利益。
    法国代表团在我们第一次会议上提出了它的解决印度支那问题的建议。在这一期间，我们有可能仔细地研究了法国的计划以及其他代表团的建议。
    法国建议的缺点是它完全没有触及政治问题。然而每一个人都知道，要停止旷日持久的印度支那战争，就至少要解决某一些这一类的问题，这两者是分不开的。在法国的计划中，可以看得出，对于在寮国和高棉业已展开的民族解放斗争估计不足。但是，把整个印度支那局势的问题仅限于越南情况的发展是不成的。
    此外，在法国的建议中还提到在这次会议上所将达成的协议的保证。在法国建议中这样说：
    “由参加日内瓦会议的国家提供对这些协议的保证。凡有任何违反协议情事，这些国家应立即进行磋商，以便个别地或集体地采取适当的措施。”
    苏联代表团不能完全同意上述建议。但是，苏联代表团认为，法国建议参加日内瓦会议的国家应保证会议上所通过的协定得以履行，这些国家并应在凡有任何违反这些协定的事情发生时，进行磋商，这一原则是可以接受的。进行磋商的目的是采取集体措施以保证这些协定的履行。参加这次会议的其他人对法国代表团的这一重要建议最好也表示自己的态度。
    有人还指出，越南民主共和国所提出的方案规定，停战协定条款的履行仅仅是由三个国家中的交战双方所组成的混合委员会来加以监督，并特别指出，这样，计划没有规定由某些国际组织加以适当的监督。
    由于在这一问题上达成协议具有重大的意义，苏联代表团建议对这些建议加以补充。我们可以协议由中立国代表组成委员会以监督停战协定的履行。
    在确定这个委员会的成员方面应该说是不会碰到不可克服的困难的。
    有鉴于此，苏联代表团对上述建议提出下列补充：“为协助双方履行停止敌对行动的协定的条款，协定中应规定建立中立国监督委员会。”
    在这次日内瓦会议上，法国面临着一项重大问题：法国在印度支那选择什么道路。一条道路是继续进行印度支那战争，从而为了外国的侵略计划而扩大战争，它对法国的民族利益毫无好处。另一条道路是协商，首先是和越南人民协商，并向这一方面继续努力，以保证迅速停战和确立印度支那的和平。走这条道路，就可以使法国和印度支那人民互相谅解并在他们之间确立友好关系。日内瓦会议应该尽力促成印度支那问题得到这样的和平解决。
    当然，苏联代表团是要对英国代表在上次会议上所提出的一切问题表示自己的意见的。但是，现在已经可以说，把事情缩小成为仅仅这样一些问题，而放过印度支那的事态发展所已经提出的一些军事性和政治性的问题，这是不适宜的。
    苏联代表团也和中华人民共和国代表团一样，对越南民主共和国代表所提出的建议寄予重大的重视。苏联代表团对这些建议表示支持，并希望这些建议会得到应有的注意。同时，苏联代表团相信，日内瓦会议也将研究其他一切真正有助于恢复印度支那和平的建议。苏联政府认为，在对印度支那人民的民族利益作应有的考虑下来解决印度支那问题，将不仅在巩固亚洲和平的事业中，而且在巩固世界和平的事业中都是一个重要的步骤。
