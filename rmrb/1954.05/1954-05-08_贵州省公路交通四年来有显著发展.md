Guizhou Province has seen great development in highway transportation. Currently, 79% of the counties and districts in the province are connected to Guiyang City by highways. In the four years since liberation, ten new highways have been built, totaling 1,033 kilometers in length. The original 2,700+ kilometers of highways have been completely repaired, and 1,071 kilometers of highways have been reconstructed. In addition, many post roads and rural roads have also been built.

Guizhou, located in a plateau area, has no railways, and its waterways are also difficult to navigate, making highways the primary mode of transportation. Guizhou Province's production of mercury, manganese, phosphate ore, and local specialties such as tung oil, flue-cured tobacco, medicinal materials, and pig bristles are exported in large quantities every year via highways. Salt, cotton yarn, construction steel, factory and mining machinery, and other materials from other places are also continuously transported to various locations via highways to supply the production and living needs of the people of Guizhou.

The development of highway transportation has promoted the prosperity of the market economy and reduced transportation costs, which has also lowered prices. For example, the price of salt has been reduced more than 30 times in recent years, with the average price per dan (approximately 50 kg) dropping from 650,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan.

Many newly built highways and post roads lead to remote areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, playing an important role in the economic lives of people in those areas. In the past, ethnic minorities living in Yewoping and Shanwangmiao had to transport salt from Bijie County, hundreds of miles away, by human and animal power. Due to the small volume of transportation and high transportation costs, many ethnic minorities could not afford salt. After the completion of the highway from Weining to Shuicheng, the transportation price of salt was reduced by more than 25%. As a result, the local people were able to afford salt. (Wu Jianghang)

    贵州省公路交通四年来有显著发展
    贵州省公路交通有很大发展。现在全省百分之七十九的县、区，都有公路和贵阳市相通。解放四年来，新建的公路有十条，共长一千零三十三公里。原有的两千七百多公里公路已完全修复，改建的公路有一千零七十一公里。另外，还修建了许多驿道和乡村大道。
    高原地带的贵州，没有铁路，河道也艰险难行，运输任务主要靠公路担负。贵州省所产的汞、锰、磷矿和桐油、烤烟、药材、猪鬃等土特产，每年都大量经过公路向外输出。外地的食盐、花纱、基本建设钢材、厂矿机械等物资，也通过公路源源运往各地，供应贵州人民生产和生活资料的需要。
    公路交通的发展，促进了市场经济繁荣，降低了运输成本，因而也减低了物价，如食盐几年来共降低售价三十多次，每担盐平均由六十五万元降低到二十万元。
    不少新建的公路、驿道都通往边远兄弟民族聚居地区，对边远地区人民的经济生活起着重要的作用。过去住在野窝坪和山王庙的兄弟民族，要从数百里外的毕节县城用人背马驮运盐，由于运量少、运费贵，不少兄弟民族人民都吃不上盐。威宁到水城公路修通后，盐的运价就降低了百分之二十五以上。因此当地人民都吃上盐了。　（伍江航）
