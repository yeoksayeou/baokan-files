Farmers of Yi and Han nationalities in Xichang Special District, Xikang Province, and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region are actively increasing insect wax production to support the country's industrial construction.

Since liberation, the insect wax industry in Xichang Special District and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region has greatly developed with the support and assistance of the People's Government. In 1953, Xichang Special District renovated more than 125,000 old insect trees and 173,100 wax trees, and propagated more than 317,000 insect trees and 25,000 wax trees. In recent years, the People's Government has also cultivated more than one million insect tree seedlings, providing favorable conditions for the future development of the wax insect industry. This year, farmers engaged in the insect wax industry have paid more attention to this work. In two villages in Xixi Township, Xichang County alone, more than 32,000 insect trees were planted. Yi farmers in Wupo Insect Garden, Zhuhe District, Zhaojue County, have also begun to pay attention to cultivating insect trees, protecting insect trees, and preventing goats from eating the leaves, which affects the growth of insects. With the help of staff, many farmers engaged in the insect wax industry have also "renovated" old trees that are one or two hundred years old, which has significantly increased insect production. It is estimated that the wax insect production in the two regions this year can increase by more than six times compared to 1952.

Currently, it is the time to harvest wax insects. The Xichang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Finance Committee has twice consulted with relevant departments to study the purchase, sale, harvesting, hanging, loans, and transportation of wax insects, and has made specific regulations. Cooperatives and trade companies are preparing to uniformly manage wax insects and have set reasonable purchase and sale prices for wax insects. In order to further strengthen technical guidance on harvesting and hanging wax insects, experienced farmers have been hired to provide guidance.

At present, relevant departments in various insect-producing areas are carrying out work such as harvesting, hanging, selling, and transporting insects. Yi compatriots in insect-producing areas such as Zhaojue, Xide, and Meigu counties in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region plan to sell more than 4,800 packages (approximately nine taels per package) of wax insects to wax farmers in western Sichuan for hanging wax.

Note: White wax insects are small insects that are named because they secrete white wax from their backs when hung on white wax trees. White wax is a very important raw material in industrial production. Xichang Special District, Xikang Province, is the best place for "insects," and southern and western Sichuan Province are the best places for producing "white wax," but the insects for hanging wax are mostly supplied by the Xichang area.

    西康省西昌专区和凉山彝族自治区
    彝汉农民积极生产虫蜡支援工业生产
    西康省西昌专区和凉山彝族自治区彝、汉农民积极提高虫蜡生产量，支援祖国工业建设。
    解放以来，西昌专区和凉山彝族自治区的虫蜡业，在人民政府扶持与帮助下，有了很大的发展。一九五三年西昌专区就整修了旧有虫树十二万五千多株，蜡树十七万三千一百株，繁殖虫树三十一万七千多株，蜡树二万五千株。几年来人民政府还培育了虫树苗一百万株以上，给今后发展蜡虫业准备了有利条件。今年经营虫、蜡业的农民更加注意了这项工作。仅西昌县西溪乡的两个村子就栽植了虫树三万二千多株。昭觉县竹核区乌坡虫园的彝族农民，也开始重视培植虫树，保护虫树，防止羊子吃树叶影响虫子生长。很多经营虫、蜡业的农民还在工作人员的帮助下，把一两百年的老树进行了“更新”，使虫子产量得到显著的提高。估计今年两区的蜡虫产量可比一九五二年增加到六倍以上。
    目前，正是摘蜡虫的时候。西昌专署财委会已经两次会同有关部门研究了蜡虫的购、销、摘、挂、贷款、调运等问题，并作了具体的规定。合作社、贸易公司，准备统一经营蜡虫。并订出了合理的蜡虫购销价格。为了进一步加强对摘、挂蜡虫的技术指导，已聘请有经验的农民进行指导。
    现在，各产虫区有关部门正在进行摘、挂、销、运虫子等工作。凉山彝族自治区昭觉、喜德、美姑等县产虫区彝胞，计划把四千八百多包（每包约九两）蜡虫卖给川西蜡农挂蜡。
      按：白蜡虫是一种小虫，因为挂在白蜡树上，能从背面分泌出白蜡而得名。白蜡是工业生产上很重要的原料，西康省西昌专区是“虫子”最好的地方，四川省的川南、川西是产“白蜡”最好的地方，但挂蜡的虫子多由西昌地区供应。
