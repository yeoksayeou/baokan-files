Shanxi Province's First High-Altitude Irrigation Canal Releases Water
Tianzhen County's New Valley Reservoir Completed

Shanxi Province's first high-altitude electromechanical irrigation project, the "May 1st" Irrigation Canal, has been completed and put into operation in early May. The canal water flows through a 1,700-meter-long main canal and more than 20 branch canals, irrigating over 1,600 mu of dry land on the north bank of the Zhang River. Many members of agricultural production cooperatives are determined to strive for increased grain production to repay the government and the working-class brothers for their immense support of agricultural production.

The terrain in southeastern Shanxi Province is high and steep, and the waters of the Zhang River have long been unusable for irrigation. In April 1952, at the request of local farmers, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau built a high-altitude mechanical irrigation canal in Hepai Village, Lucheng County, downstream of the Zhang River. They allocated a vertical deep-well propeller pump, a 50-horsepower electric motor, and other electrical equipment, investing over 210 million yuan. During the construction period, local farmers formed nine canal-building brigades, with more than 800 people taking turns to work on the project daily. Workers from the local state-owned Luan Coal Mine Power Plant also actively helped install high-voltage lines and transmission equipment. The construction of all main and branch canals, length slots, retaining walls, water pipelines, and stilling basins was completed on schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

The first valley reservoir newly built in Tianzhen County, Shanxi Province, was completed in mid-May. This reservoir can hold 190,000 cubic meters of water and can irrigate 6,600 mu of farmland. There are many natural streams in Tianzhen County, but for many years, the masses have rarely made use of them. A larger stream located in villages such as San Shi Li Pu, 30 li southwest of the city, has 6,600 mu of farmland on both sides, but the masses only use the stream water to irrigate 2,000 mu of land. More than 4,000 mu of dry land is chronically short of water. In 1953, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau sent technical cadres to the county for detailed surveys. They believed that the county had many conditions suitable for building small valley reservoirs using mountain streams. Therefore, they focused on the streams in the gullies around Liujiazhuang and other villages in San Shi Li Pu to build a pilot small valley reservoir, in order to promote small-scale water conservancy work throughout the county. In late July of last year, this project began under the direct guidance of the local People's Government Water Conservancy Department. After partial construction last autumn, construction of embankments, slope-protection earth dams, highway culverts, and reservoir management houses continued this spring. In early May, the reservoir project was fully completed.

    山西省第一座高地灌溉渠放水
    天镇县新建山谷水库竣工
    山西省第一座高地电力机械灌溉工程——“五一”灌溉渠建成，并已在五月初放水。渠水通过一千七百公尺长的干渠和二十多条支渠渠道。灌溉着漳河北岸一千六百多亩旱田。许多农业生产合作社的社员都决心要努力增产粮食，答谢政府和工人兄弟对农业生产莫大的支援。
    山西省东南部地势高陡，漳河的水流长期不能用来灌溉。一九五二年四月山西省人民政府水利局应当地农民请求，在漳河下游潞城县河湃村建筑高地机械水利灌溉渠，并调配直立式深井螺桨抽水机一部、五十匹马力电动机一部和其他电器设备，先后投资二亿一千多万元。修建期间，当地农民组成九个修渠大队，以每天八百多人轮流赶修。当地国营潞安煤矿发电厂工人也来积极帮助装置高压线和输电设备，干、支渠道、长度槽、挡水墙、输水管和静水地等工程全部按期修建完成。（新华社）

    山西省天镇县新建的第一座山谷水库，已于五月中旬竣工。这座水库可容水十九万立方公尺，可以灌溉六千六百亩农田。天镇县境内有许多自然小溪，但多少年来，群众很少加以利用。位于城西南三十里铺等村的一条较大溪水，两边有六千六百亩农田，但群众利用溪水才浇灌两千亩土地。其他四千多亩旱地常年缺水。一九五三年，省水利局派技术干部到该县详细勘察后，认为该县利用山涧溪水修建小型山谷水库的条件很多，就以三十里铺刘家庄等村一带的沟间溪水为重点，试建小型山谷水库，以推动全县的小型水利工作。去年七月下旬，这个工程在当地人民政府水利部门的直接指导下开始动工。去年秋天部分施工后，今春又继续修建围堤、护坡土坝、公路涵洞和看管水库房等工程。五月上旬，水库工程就全部竣工了。
