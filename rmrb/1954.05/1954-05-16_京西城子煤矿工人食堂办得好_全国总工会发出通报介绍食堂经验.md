The Jingxi Mining Bureau's Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria is run very well, and has played a relatively good role in ensuring workers' health and promoting production.

The Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria established a sideline production team, making its own tofu and pickled vegetables. At the same time, it also raised more than 30 edible pigs and one sow. The sow gives birth twice a year, producing more than 20 piglets. The pigs are mainly fed with tofu dregs and leftover food. Therefore, the pork they eat is two-fifths cheaper than the market price. In terms of vegetables, the cafeteria signed a vegetable contract with the nearby agricultural production cooperative. This not only ensured timely supply and saved procurement and transportation resources, but also the price was lower than buying on the market.

Since the state implemented the grain planned supply system, the Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria has vigorously researched the processing of coarse grains into fine foods and improved cooking methods. Thanks to the cooks' ingenuity, there are more than 120 varieties of food made from coarse grains. Thousand-layer cake, bowl cake, large pancakes, and stuffed double-sided fried cakes are delicious and cheap, and are very popular with workers.

The Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria has also established a cafeteria hygiene system. Medical personnel calculate the nutrition of staple and non-staple foods. A hygiene team leader is selected from the cooks to inspect cooking utensils, supervise washing, disinfection, cleaning, wiping tables, and the cooks' personal hygiene work such as bathing, laundry, nail trimming, and wearing masks. In addition, a division of labor responsibility system, reward system, and rotation system have also been established among the cooks.

The Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria ensures the timely, reasonable, and inexpensive supply of workers' meals, which is welcomed by the workers and plays a role in ensuring workers' health and promoting production. The Chengzishan Coal Mine overfulfilled its production tasks in 1953 and the first quarter of 1954, and the well-run workers' cafeteria is a factor.

The main reason why the Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria is run so well is the emphasis and active support from the mine leadership.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a circular on the work experience of the Chengzishan Coal Mine workers' cafeteria. The circular pointed out that many factories and mines' trade union organizations do not pay enough attention to workers' cafeterias, and some trade union cadres still have a phenomenon of not caring about workers' lives, and even have the erroneous idea that "less welfare means less economicism." The circular pointed out that the central task of the trade union is to do a good job in production, and only on the basis of developing production can workers' lives be gradually improved. However, trade union organizations also have the responsibility to closely monitor workers' lives and ensure workers' health. Trade union organizations at all levels should actively assist the enterprise administration in doing a good job in the cafeteria, and factories and mines with the conditions should develop the production of non-staple foods, so that the cafeteria work can be continuously improved and play its due role in ensuring workers' health and promoting production.

### 京西城子煤矿工人食堂办得好  全国总工会发出通报介绍食堂经验

    京西城子煤矿工人食堂办得好
    全国总工会发出通报介绍食堂经验
    京西矿务局城子煤矿工人食堂办得很好，对于保证工人健康和推动生产起了比较好的作用。
    城子煤矿工人食堂成立了副业生产组，自己磨豆腐和腌菜，同时还饲养了三十多只食用猪和一只母猪。母猪每年生育两次，能产小猪二十多只。猪的饲料主要是豆腐渣和剩菜剩饭。所以他们吃的猪肉，价格要比市场便宜五分之二。在蔬菜方面，食堂和附近的农业生产合作社订立了蔬菜合同。这样，不仅保证了按时供给，节省了采购和运输力量，而且价格比在市场购买要低。
    在国家实行粮食计划供应以来，城子煤矿工人食堂大力研究了粗粮细作，并且改善了烹调方法。由于炊事人员开动了脑筋，各式各样的粗粮细作的食品达一百二十多种。千层糕、碗糕、大张煎饼和带馅两面焦等食品，既好吃，又便宜，很受工人欢迎。
    城子煤矿工人食堂还建立了食堂卫生制度，主食和副食都由医务人员计算营养。炊事员中选出卫生小组长，检查炊事工具，督促洗刷、消毒、打扫、擦桌子和炊事员个人的洗澡、洗衣、剪指甲、戴口罩等卫生工作。此外，在炊事员中还建立了分工负责制、奖励制和轮休制度等。
    城子煤矿工人食堂保证了工人伙食的及时、合理和廉价供应，受到工人群众的欢迎，对保证工人健康和推动生产都起了作用。城子煤矿一九五三年和一九五四年第一季度的生产任务都超额完成，工人食堂办得好是一个因素。
    城子煤矿工人食堂办得好的主要原因，是煤矿领导方面的重视和积极支持。
    中华全国总工会最近把城子煤矿工人食堂的工作经验作了通报。通报指出：有不少厂矿企业的工会组织对工人食堂不够重视，部分工会干部还存在着不关心工人生活的现象，甚至有认为“少办福利就少犯经济主义”的错误思想。通报指出：工会的中心工作是搞好生产，只有在发展生产的基础上，才能逐步地改善工人生活。但工会组织也有责任密切关注工人的生活，保证工人健康。工会各级组织应积极地协助企业行政方面作好食堂工作，有条件的厂矿应发展副食品的生产，使食堂工作不断改进，在保证工人健康和推动生产上发挥应有的作用。　　　　（新华社）
