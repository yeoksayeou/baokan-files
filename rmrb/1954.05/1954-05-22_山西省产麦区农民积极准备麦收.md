Farmers in wheat-producing areas of Shanxi Province are actively preparing for the wheat harvest. In the Yuncheng, Linfen, and Changzhi regions, with the exception of wheat seedlings that suffered more severe frost damage and are now recovering after rescue efforts, most wheat fields have reached the heading stage and are growing well. In Linfen County, the wheat is generally about four feet tall, and the ears of wheat are more than two inches long. In the Li Jingcai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taoli Village, Yongji County, 878 mu of wheat were planted. It is estimated that the six mu of irrigated land will yield an average of over 550 jin per mu, while the dry land will yield over 200 jin per mu. The best 23 mu are expected to yield 700 jin per mu. By the end of May, wheat will be harvested in areas such as Yuncheng and Linfen. Farmers everywhere are actively preparing for the wheat harvest. Farmers in Wenxi County have already purchased over 9,500 pieces of wheat harvesting tools such as sickles, wooden shovels, sickle handles, and mulberry scythes from supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as over 9,300 jin of hemp rope and leather rope. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Yuxiang County have formulated plans for timely harvesting and threshing to increase the yield of wheat fields, striving to complete the summer harvest within ten days. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Yongji County have signed mutual assistance contracts with neighboring cooperatives to jointly use labor and support each other in harvesting in order to prevent wind disasters. Efforts are being made to ensure fast harvesting and thorough collection, avoid wind disasters, and reduce losses. In order to do a good job in the wheat harvest, the Agriculture Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has notified agricultural leadership organs at all levels throughout the province to immediately organize the masses to prepare for the wheat harvest, ensure timely harvesting, and reduce losses from wind and hail. In areas with insufficient labor and animal power, it is necessary to widely mobilize the masses to support each other. Farmers in all areas are also called upon to pay attention to careful harvesting and threshing to reduce losses and increase yields during harvesting. It is also necessary to organize farmers in a planned way to carry out wheat comparison work, focusing on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and widely mobilize and organize the masses to implement field selection, ear selection, and threshing ground ear selection and other seed selection work.

    山西省产麦区农民积极准备麦收
    山西产麦区农民正积极准备麦收。运城、临汾、长治等专区除受冻较重的麦苗经抢救恢复后正在抽穗外，一般麦田均已齐穗，生长良好。临汾县的小麦都有四尺左右高，麦穗有二寸多长。永济县桃李村李敬才农业生产合作社，种小麦八百七十八亩，其中六亩水地麦预计每亩平均可收五百五十斤以上，旱地麦每亩可收二百斤以上，最好的二十三亩每亩可收到七百斤。五月底，运城临汾等地就要收割小麦，各地农民正积极进行麦收前的准备工作，闻喜县的农民已向供销社购买镰刀、木锨、镰把桑?等收麦用具九千五百多件，麻绳、皮绳等九千三百多斤，虞乡县许多农业生产合作社和互助组为了提高麦田的收获量，特订出适时收割及时打场的计划，争取十天时间完成夏收任务。永济县许多农业生产合作社为了预防风灾，都与邻社订出统一使用劳力、互相支援收割的互助合同。做到割的快、收的净，避免风灾，减少损失。山西省人民政府农业厅为了做好麦收工作，通知全省各级农业领导机关，立即组织群众准备麦收，保证适时收割，减少风磨脱粒和雹灾损失。劳畜力不足的地区，要广泛发动群众相互支援，并号召各地农民在收割时要注意细收细打，减少损失，增加收获量；并要有计划地组织农民，开展小麦评比工作，以农业生产合作社和互助组为中心，广泛发动和组织群众实行田间片选、穗选及场上穗选等选种工作。    （鲁生　郭石）
