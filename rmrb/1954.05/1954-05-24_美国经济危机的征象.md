“Prosperity” Example

Recently, amid the general downturn in the United States, debt collection agencies, established solely to collect debts for creditors, have been developing rapidly. According to a report in the "Wall Street Journal," an employee of a Chicago-based debt collection company said, "We have never seen anything like this in our twenty-seven years of operation," "The number of accounts entrusted to us for collection has increased alarmingly in the past thirty to sixty days." In larger cities such as Detroit, Boston, and Pittsburgh, there are increasing instances of debtors being unable to repay their debts, with creditors taking other possessions as collateral. Some cases are so entangled that they end up in court. This year, the St. Louis Circuit Court has handled 259 such debt collection cases, a 40 percent increase compared to the same period last year. Additionally, such lawsuits are continuously increasing in cities like San Francisco, Detroit, and Cleveland.

President Eisenhower promised to use the so-called power of the federal government to maintain American "prosperity," and this "prosperity" is now being realized, with the business of debt collection agencies being one example.

“Boom Month” Not Booming

March is a "boom month" that American industrial and commercial figures look forward to, and some in the American ruling circles placed their hopes for an improvement in the economic situation at this time (United Press International, New York, February 18). However, things did not go as planned. According to estimates from the American Iron and Steel Institute, the operating rate of the steel industry will decline to 66.5 percent in the week ending March 27, a decrease of 36.6 percent compared to the same period last year. Other industries, such as automobile manufacturing, also experienced sluggishness in March. In the two weeks ending March 27, American automobile production decreased by 14 percent compared to the same period last year, while inventory continued to increase day by day. According to statistics from Dun & Bradstreet, due to the decline in retail trade volume in March, the number of store closures continued to increase. In the three weeks from March 4 to 25, the number of American store closures was 223, 229, and 243, an increase of 52 percent compared to the same period last year.

From the above situation, it is clear that the Wall Street bosses who hoped to improve their economic situation with a seasonal rebound have been greatly disappointed.

The Threat of Layoffs

According to an Associated Press dispatch from New York on April 15, advertising space has increased in many American cities compared to a year ago, but the number of customers has decreased. A retailer in Tennessee said that some people "still have money and jobs, they are just more careful (with spending)." In industrial areas, inexpensive clothing sells much faster than expensive clothing. Some people have decent incomes, but they always look for cheaper products. Comparing market purchasing power this year with last year, it can be seen that even relatively wealthy people in the United States are holding onto their money more tightly this year than last year. The American "Business Week," published on March 22, stated that only 6.8 percent of people plan to buy homes this year, compared to 8.8 percent last year; 26.8 percent plan to buy furniture and large household appliances this year, compared to 31.9 percent last year.

How can this phenomenon be explained? The "New York Herald Tribune" said, "Americans are now more panicked by the depression than ever before." Associated Press reporter Breed also admitted that people are afraid of layoffs, so they are afraid to spend money.

“Predictions” and Reality

Ignoring the increasingly severe signs of the American economic crisis, many American economists predicted at the end of last year that 1954 would be the "second most prosperous year in history." However, these economists' "predictions" have been mocked by even American bourgeois newspapers such as the "New York Herald Tribune." The newspaper published a cartoon in which a fisherman shouted, "It looks like we've caught a big fish!" while Uncle Sam (America) on the shore was already waiting with a fork and iron pot to eat the fish. However, this big fish, with "1954" ("Second Most Prosperous Year in History") labeled on its head, didn't care at all, dragging the unfortunate "prophet" to the bottom of the sea. (Image attached)

### 美国经济危机的征象

    美国经济危机的征象
    “繁荣”一例
    近来，在美国百业萧条的情况下，专为债主催账而设的代办营业却在飞速地发展。据美国“华尔街日报”报道，一个芝加哥催账公司的职员说：“在我们二十七年来的营业中，从来也没有见过这种情况”，“在过去三十天到六十天时间内，交给我们催索的账目的数目有可怕的增加”。在底特律、波士顿和匹兹堡这些较大的城市中，债户们因为无力偿还债务而被债权者拿去其他东西作为抵债的现象是越来越多了。有的纠缠不清，便闹到法院里去，今年以来，在圣路易巡回法院受理这种追索欠债的案件已达二百五十九宗，比去年同期增加百分之四十；此外，在旧金山、底特律和克利夫兰等城市，这种诉讼案子也在不断地增多。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔曾保证要用所谓联邦政府的权力来维持美国的“繁荣”，现在这种“繁荣”正在实现着，催债代办所营业的情况就是一个例子。
        “旺月”不旺
    三月份，是美国工商业人士所盼望的一个“旺月”，在美国统治集团中，也有些人把他们对经济情况好转的幻想寄托在这个时候（合众社纽约二月十八日电）。但是，事与愿违，据美国钢铁研究所估计，到三月二十七日为止的一周中，钢铁工业的开工率要下降到百分之六十六点五，和去年同期比较，又下降了百分之三十六点六。其他如汽车制造等行业，在三月份同样存在着不景气的现象，到三月二十七日为止的两周内，美国汽车的生产较去年同期又减少了百分之十四，而存货却仍然在一天一天地增加。据邓—布列德斯特里统计所的统计，由于三月份零售贸易额的下降，商店倒闭的数字也在继续增多，从三月四日到二十五日的三周内，美国商店倒闭的数字是二百二十三、二百二十九和二百四十三家，和去年同期比较，倒闭的数目增加了百分之五十二。
    从上面的情况看来，显然是使那些希望以季节性的回升来改善他们经济情况的华尔街老板们大失所望了。
      解雇的威胁
    据美联社纽约四月十五日电讯消息，在美国很多城市中，广告的篇幅比一年前增加了很多，但是顾客却减少了。田纳西州一个零售商人说，有的人“仍然有钱，有工作，他们（花钱）就是更加小心了”。工业区里，廉价的衣着销售得比华贵的衣着要快得多，有的人收入还不错，可是他们总是找廉价品。若把今年市场上的购买力同去年比较一下，可以看出：在美国，即使比较富裕的人们今年对钱的掌握也比较去年更紧了。三月二十二日出版的美国“商业周刊”说，今年打算购买房屋的人只占百分之六·八，而去年是百分之八·八；今年打算买家具及大件家庭用具的人占百分之二十六·八，去年是百分之三十一·九。
    怎样来解释这种现象呢？“纽约先驱论坛报”说：“美国人现在由于萧条而产生的惊慌比任何时候都厉害。”美联社的记者布里德也承认：人们害怕解雇，所以不敢花钱买东西。
      “预言”与现实
    美国许多经济学家不顾美国经济危机征象不断加剧的事实，在去年年底预言：一九五四年将是
  “第二次最繁荣的历史年代”。可是，这些经济学家的“预言”，已引起甚至像“纽约先驱论坛报”这样的美国资产阶级报纸的嘲笑。这个报纸登了这样一幅漫画，一个渔夫叫喊道：“我们好像钓着了一条大鱼！”而岸上的山姆大叔（美国）早已拿着叉子和铁锅等着吃鱼肉了。可是，这条头上标着“一九五四”的大鱼（“第二次最繁荣的历史年代”）却毫不在乎，它拖着倒霉的“预言家”沉到海底去了。（附图片）
