The Henan Provincial Education Department, in order to prepare for the participation in labor production and enrollment of senior primary and junior middle school graduates throughout the province this year, convened a meeting of directors of cultural and educational bureaus (sections) from various special districts and cities at the beginning of this month. The meeting studied how primary and secondary schools should strengthen the education of students in loving labor and obeying the needs of the country, and establish correct views on participating in production and enrollment. The meeting decided to combine the propaganda and education of the general task of the country's transition period, so that the masses, cadres, especially students' parents, can enthusiastically encourage and welcome the participation of primary and secondary school graduates in production, and form a glorious social opinion on the participation of primary and secondary school graduates in labor production. The meeting also studied how to properly solve the enrollment and other issues of primary and secondary school graduates this year.

In addition: In the middle of this month, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League held a forum for primary and secondary school graduates from all over the province who are participating in industrial and agricultural production. At the meeting, Zhang De'an, an outstanding young planer at the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, and Shi Lianjie, a female graduate of senior primary school from Lushan County last summer and now the vice-chairman of an agricultural production cooperative, introduced their correct views on participating in labor production and their model deeds. Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, attended the meeting and gave a speech and awards. Labor models from various industries and agriculture also sent letters of congratulation. A grand radio rally was also held at the meeting on the participation of primary and secondary school graduates in labor production. Primary and secondary schools throughout the province organized more than 70,000 students, teachers, and students' parents to listen, and the vast number of young students who were educated expressed that they would obey the needs of the country after graduation and actively invest in industrial and agricultural production.
