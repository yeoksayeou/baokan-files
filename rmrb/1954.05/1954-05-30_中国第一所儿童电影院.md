This year on New Year's Day, China's first children's cinema was completed near Stalin Avenue in Changchun. It is a tall, convex-shaped white building. Above the cinema's entrance is the emblem of the Young Pioneers of China, decorated with neon lights, and the large characters "Children's Cinema."

Although this cinema was converted from a general cinema, its internal equipment and layout are completely different. The more than eight hundred seats in the auditorium have been replaced with seats suitable for children's heights, and the young audience members feel particularly comfortable sitting on them. In the lounge and reading room, there are many specially made small red velvet chairs and round small tables, each table adorned with fresh flowers. To protect the children's eyes, the reading room is also equipped with daylight lamps.

On the opening day, the cinema screened the Soviet film "Happy Childhood" and the German fairy tale film "The Magic Lamp." Since then, the cinema has regularly screened films specially loved by children. In the past few months, it has screened children's feature films and fairy tale films such as "Little Navy," "Son of the Regiment," "Blessings for Children," "Cotton Boll," and "The Magic Flute"; it has also screened some general documentaries and feature films that are easy for children to understand, such as "Anshan Steel in Construction," "Stalin Lives Forever in Our Hearts," "People United as One," "People on the Prairie," and "Sever the Devil's Claws."

The Children's Cinema also timely screens relevant films to cooperate with school teaching and ideological education. Students from Changchun No. 5 Middle School, after learning about Michurin's cultivation methods in their botany textbook, are experimenting with growing various plants using Michurin's methods. The cinema screened "Michurin" for them. When schools are conducting discipline education, the cinema screens "First Grade Girl." Many children, after watching the movie, put their hands behind their backs in class, gradually developing the habit of listening attentively.

The cinema also has an attached recreation room where children can play various games. The cinema also has an open space with loudspeakers where children can listen to music and hear special broadcasters report current events in simple and easy-to-understand language. If children want to understand the theme and content of a certain film, they can find a counselor in the cinema who is specifically responsible for this. The cinema staff members care for the young audience members with the patience and kindness of health workers.

This cinema is now immensely loved by all the children in Changchun and valued by the children's parents. Children from both the city and the suburbs like to come here to watch movies, and their parents often bring them here. Although the Children's Cinema, like other cinemas in Changchun, screens three or four shows a day, it has the highest attendance rate among the city's eight cinemas. From New Year's Day to April this year, the Children's Cinema has had more than 129,000 young viewers. Some young viewers often come to the cinema to help with cleaning and maintaining order. They also hold forums with the cinema staff and visit the cinema manager to offer opinions and suggestions to the cinema.

Recently, the cinema has done some work in accordance with the opinions and requests of the young audience members. The reading room will soon add more than 300 new picture albums, children's storybooks, and popular books on economic construction. The recreation room will add various new toys. At the same time, the cinema has begun preparing slides with school life as the theme. The cinema also plans to replace all the seats in the auditorium with soft seats and rebuild a large recreation room that can accommodate two to three hundred children in the next two years.

### 中国第一所儿童电影院

    中国第一所儿童电影院
    新华社记者　邹士芬
    今年元旦，中国的第一所儿童电影院在长春市斯大林大街附近落成了。这是一所高大的凸字形的白色建筑物。影院的大门上有用霓虹灯装饰着的中国少年先锋队的队徽和“儿童电影院”几个大字。
    这所影院虽然是由一所一般的电影院改建的，但它的内部的各种设备和布置已经完全不同了。场内八百多个座位已换成适合儿童身长的座位了，小观众们坐在上面，感到格外的舒适。在休息室和阅览室里有许多特制的红色小绒椅和圆形小桌，每个桌子上都放着鲜花。为了保护儿童的眼睛，阅览室还装上了日光灯。
    影院在开幕的那一天，放映了苏联影片“幸福的儿童时代”和德国神话片“神灯”，以后影院就经常专门放映着为儿童们所喜爱的影片。几个月来已放映的有“小海军”、“团的儿子”、“为孩子们祝福”、“棉桃”、“宝盒仙笛”等儿童故事片、童话片；也放映了一些容易为儿童理解的一般纪录片和故事片，如“鞍钢在建设中”、“斯大林永远活在我们的心里”、“人民心一条”、“草原上的人们”、“斩断魔爪”等。
    儿童电影院还为配合学校教学和思想教育，及时放映有关的影片。长春市第五中学的学生们在学过植物课本里的米丘林栽培方法以后，正在用米丘林的方法试种着各种植物。影院就为他们放映了“米丘林”。当各学校里进行纪律教育时，影院就放映了“一年级女生”。许多儿童在看过电影以后，上课时把手放在背后，渐渐养成了专心听讲的习惯。
    影院另附设有游艺室，儿童们可以在游艺室里做各种游戏。影院还设有广播喇叭的空场，儿童们可以在这里听音乐，听专门的广播员用通俗易懂的话报告时事。如果儿童们要了解某一影片的主题和内容，就可以找电影院里的专门负责这方面问题的辅导员。影院工作人员们都像保健员那样的耐心而又亲切地关心来影院的小观众。
    这所影院现在已经受到长春全市儿童们的无比的喜爱和儿童家长们的重视，无论市内和郊区的儿童都喜欢到这里来看电影，他们的父母也常常带他们到这里来看电影。儿童电影院虽然和长春市别的影院一样，每天放映三场或四场，但它却是全市八所电影院中上座率最高的。从今年元旦到四月止，儿童电影院的小观众已有十二万九千多人次。有些小观众还时常到影院来帮助作清扫工作和维持秩序。他们还和影院的工作人员举行座谈会，访问影院经理，对影院提出意见和要求。
    最近，影院已按照小观众们的意见和要求，作了一些工作。阅览室不久就要增添三百多册各种新的画报、儿童故事书和有关经济建设的通俗书籍。游艺室将要增加各种新的玩具。同时影院已开始准备以学校生活为题材的幻灯片。影院还计划在今后两年内将场内座位全部换成软席，并改建一个可以容纳二、三百个儿童活动的大游艺室。
