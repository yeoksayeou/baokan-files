    The Beginning of Warehouse Mechanization
    By our reporter Shen Wenying
    Walking through the gates of the Eastern Suburbs Grain Warehouse, the clear sound of machines turning can be heard in the distance. Passing neatly arranged newly-built warehouses, on the spacious freight yard stand countless tall and large grain stacks stretching as far as the eye can see. Beside several of these stacks, several machines resembling iron frames, more than four zhang long, lean against them, their belts turning incessantly. At the end of the machine touching the ground, there is something like a wooden box (grain receiving hopper), and workers are nervously pouring grain into it one after another. The grain rises with the rotation of the belt, and when it reaches the top, it pours down like a waterfall, falling into the stack, soon piling up like a small mountain peak.
    Warehouse Director Ji Qingde pointed to the rapidly rotating machine and said:
  "This is called a belt conveyor. It can use a rotating belt to transport things to a higher place. Now, this kind of machine has long been used in the industrial and construction sectors, but we have only been using it to transport grain for the past two months. This is the beginning of warehouse mechanization!"
    Standing next to him, old loading and unloading worker Guan Yonghai, hearing the discussion about machines, wiped the sweat from his forehead, expressing his love for the machines. He had been a loading and unloading worker for more than ten years and had never thought that machines could be used to transport grain. Handling and drying grain, and other tasks, are very heavy physical labor. Open-air grain stacks are often more than one zhang two chi high, and workers carry large bags of grain, step onto sloping planks more than three zhang long, slowly walk to the edge of the stack, and pour the grain into it. Before liberation, those who did this work were so weighed down by the grain bags that they couldn't lift their heads, and they were so exploited by the feudal foremen that they couldn't even eat their fill. Empty stomachs, blurred vision, and a moment of panic at the top of the stack often caused people to fall from the stack with the grain bags, breaking their backs, arms, or legs; many vomited blood from exhaustion; and backaches and leg pains caused by the heavy work were even more common. After liberation, workers were no longer oppressed and their living standards greatly improved. The grain depot paid attention to safety equipment, but the heavy work remained unavoidable. When studying the General Line, everyone thought: Socialist industrialization is good, but it will be a long time before it reaches our loading and unloading workers; how can moving grain be done without human shoulders! However, when the first conveyor was delivered to their warehouse in February this year, everyone saw the machine start, the belt rotate, and the grain followed the belt upwards, flowing into the grain stack with a rush. This made everyone very happy. They all said: "Industrialization is coming to our warehouse, and we can see the benefits of industrialization."
    Comrade Ji Qingde led me further forward, and I saw two kinds of grain stacks in the freight yard, of distinctly different heights: some stacks were very high, and some were so short. He told me that the high grain stacks were piled by machines. Because the machine has great power and is uniform, it can be piled up to one zhang five chi high, and each stack can store 180,000 to 200,000 jin; and it only takes twenty workers to complete it in three hours. The short grain stacks are piled by hand. Because human strength is small and the force is uneven, the maximum height is only one zhang two chi, and the storage capacity is only 110,000 to 120,000 jin; and it still requires fourteen strong workers to work hard all day.
    Next to the belt conveyor, there are also auxiliary equipment tools - various types of sieves. If clean grain is needed, a sieve can be hung at the upper end of the conveyor. When the grain flows through the belt into the sieve, impurities such as dust, chaff, and dead insects are quickly sieved out. Ji Qingde also told me that vacuum cleaners and double-hopper scales and other auxiliary equipment are being designed. Using a belt conveyor to empty the warehouse, flowing from a high place downwards, can dissipate and lower the temperature of the grain, and can also reduce the moisture content of the grain. If a scale is installed at one end of the conveyor, the weight of the grain can also be known. Connecting several belt conveyors with sieves and vacuum cleaners, and then installing a scale, can simultaneously remove impurities, lower the temperature and moisture content of the grain, and know the weight of the grain. The grain can also be transported from the warehouse to the transportation vehicles through the belt conveyor, or unloaded from the transportation vehicles.
    As I was leaving the warehouse, the workers said: "Look, there are many machines in our warehouse: grain cleaning machines, drying machines, grain winnowing machines, and many other machines will come in the future. We must take good care of the country's grain so that the people of the capital can eat good grain." (Attached picture)

### 仓库机械化的开端

    仓库机械化的开端
    本报记者　沈文英
    走进东郊粮食仓库的大门，就听到远处传来清晰的机器转动声。绕过一幢幢新建的整齐的仓房，在宽敞的货场上，屹立着一眼望不到头的无数又高、又大的粮囤。其中有几个粮囤旁，斜倚着好几台约有四丈多长的像铁架子一样的机器，皮带在不停地转动。在机器着地的一端，置着一只像木箱一样的东西（接粮斗），工人们正一个接着一个紧张地把粮食往里倒。粮食随着皮带的转动往上升，一到顶端它就像瀑布一样地向下倾泻，落进囤内，不久就堆得满满的，像小山尖一样。
    仓库主任姬庆德指着正在急速转动的机器说：
  “这就叫皮带输送机。它可以利用转动的皮带，把东西输送到高处。现在，这种机器在工业、建筑部门早已使用了，而咱们使用它来搬运粮食只是最近两个月来的事，这是仓库机械化的开端啊！”
    站在旁边的老装卸工人关永海，听见在谈论机器的事儿，擦了一下额头的汗珠，表示了他对机器的热爱。他干了十多年装卸工人，就没想到过能使机器来搬运粮食。搬运和晾晒粮食等等工作，是很烦重的体力劳动。露天粮囤往往高达一丈二尺以上，工人们扛上大包粮食，踏上三丈多长的坡形的跳板，慢慢地走到囤边，把粮食倒往囤里。解放前，干这活计的，叫粮包压得抬不起头来，又叫封建把头克扣得吃不上饱饭。肚里空，眼睛花，走到囤顶上，心一慌，脚一软，常有人连人带粮包一起从囤上摔下来，不是蹩坏了腰，就是摔坏了胳膊、折断了腿；累得吐血的，也不在少数；因活累而引起腰酸腿痛，更是常事。解放后，工人不再受人压迫，生活也大大提高，粮库里注意安全设备，但工作烦重仍不可免。在学习总路线时，大伙儿还这样想：社会主义工业化好是好，可是要轮到咱装卸工人的头上还早着呢，搬运粮食怎能离得开人的肩膀！可是，今年二月里第一台输送机发给他们仓库时，大伙儿只见机器一响，皮带一转动，粮食便跟着皮带向上转，哗哗地淌进了粮囤。这一下可把大伙乐坏了。都说：“眼看工业化到咱们仓库里来了，可看到工业化的好处了。”
    姬庆德同志带着我再向前走，看到货场上有两种高矮截然不同的粮囤：有的囤很高，有的囤却又那么矮。他告诉我，那些高的粮囤是用机器堆的。因机器力量大，又均匀，可以堆到一丈五尺高，每个囤的堆存量又可达到十八万斤到二十万斤；而且只要二十个工人，就可以在三小时内做完。那些矮的粮囤是用人工堆的。因为人的力量小，使力不均匀，最高只能堆到一丈二尺高，堆存量也仅有十一、二万斤；还需要十四个身强力壮的工人，忙上一整天。
    皮带输送机的旁边，还放着附属装备工具——各式的溜筛。如果需要净粮的时候，可在输送机的上端挂上一个溜筛，粮食经过皮带一流入溜筛，灰尘、糠粉和死虫等杂质很快就筛掉了。姬庆德又告诉我，吸尘器和双斗台秤等各种附属装备正在设计中。用皮带输送机倒仓，从高处往下流，能发散和降低粮食的温度，还可以减低粮食的水份。如果把台秤安在输送机的一端，还可以知道粮食的重量。用溜筛、吸尘器把几台皮带输送机连接起来，再安上台秤，就可以同时除去杂质，降低粮食的温度和水份，知道粮食的重量，还可以通过皮带输送机把粮食从仓库里运上运输工具，或者从运输工具上把粮食卸下来。
    当我离开仓库时，工人们说：“你瞧，咱仓库里还有好多机器：有净粮机，有烘干机，有扬谷机，将来还要来好多别的机器。我们一定要把国家的粮食保管得好好的，好让首都人民吃到好粮食。”（附图片）
