The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government Instructs All Regions to Focus on Trying out Mixed Fertilization Methods

[This newspaper's dispatch] Soviet expert Buyak of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently suggested that China try the Soviet mixed fertilization method to solve China's fertilizer shortage. After research, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has adopted this suggestion and recently instructed all regions to first conduct pilot demonstrations at agricultural science research institutes, agricultural experiment stations, and state-owned farms with suitable conditions.

Mixed fertilization is a scientific fertilization method summarized last year by Academician Lysenko of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the Soviet Union. It can improve fertilizer efficiency and save a large amount of fertilizer. The method of use is extremely simple: within seven days before crop sowing (preferably one or two days), apply 266 to 400 jin of organic fertilizer (manure, compost, or humus) per mu, plus a mixed fertilizer of 40 jin to 66.6 jin of lime and 26.6 jin to 40 jin of phosphate rock powder; then plow it into the soil according to the depth of seed sowing. This fertilization method can create favorable conditions for the normal life activities of beneficial soil microorganisms, promote the vigorous life activities of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil, improve soil fertility, and fully supply plant nutrition. According to Soviet experience, the above-mentioned amount of mixed fertilizer is equivalent to the effect of applying ten times the amount of good manure.

At a fertilizer forum held by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in early May, expert Buyak introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in detail. Soil and fertilizer workers in various regions of China had enthusiastic discussions at the meeting and expressed their willingness to learn and use this method to improve China's agricultural production. The Central Ministry of Agriculture has recently made specific arrangements, requiring key research and experiments to be carried out on various different crops in various different regions.

At present, China is severely lacking in organic fertilizer, and insufficient fertilization of farmland greatly hinders agricultural production increase. According to surveys, phosphate mines have been discovered in Jiangsu, Anhui, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Rehe, and lime is available everywhere. Therefore, we have the conditions to adopt this advanced Soviet fertilization method. If this method proves effective in China, it will have a huge impact on improving China's agricultural production.

    中央人民政府农业部指示各地重点试用混合施肥方法
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部苏联专家布尼亚克，于最近建议我国试用苏联混合施肥方法，以解决我国缺肥的问题。中央农业部经研究后，已采纳这一建议，并于最近指示各地，在农业科学研究所、农业试验场及有条件的国营农场先行试验示范。
    混合施肥，是苏联全苏列宁农业科学院李森科院士于去年总结出的一种科学的施肥方法。它能够提高肥效，大量节省肥料。使用方法极为简易：在作物播种前七天以内（最好是一、两天以内），每市亩施用二百六十六斤至四百斤有机质肥料（厩肥、堆肥或腐植质），加上四十斤至六十六点六斤石灰和二十六点六斤至四十斤磷灰石粉的混合肥料；再按照种子播种的深度，翻入土中。这种施肥的方法，可为有益的土壤微生物正常的生命活动创造有利条件，促进土壤中固氮菌旺盛的生命活动，提高土壤肥力，充分供给植物营养。根据苏联的经验，上述数量的混合肥料，与施用十倍数量的好厩肥效用相等。
    布尼亚克专家五月初在我国中央农业部举行的肥料座谈会上，详细介绍了苏联的这一先进经验。我国各地区土壤肥料工作者在会上进行了热烈讨论，都表示愿意学习和利用这一方法，来提高我国的农业生产。中央农业部已于最近作了具体的布置，要求有重点地在各个不同地区的各种不同作物上进行研究试验。
    我国目前有机质肥料十分缺乏，农田施肥不足，大大妨碍农业增产。而据调查，江苏、安徽、贵州、云南、四川及热河等地都已发现磷矿，石灰则到处都有。所以，我们有条件采用苏联这一先进施肥方法。这一方法如在我国试验有效，将对我国提高农业生产发生巨大影响。
