The public-private partnership Fujian Nan'an Sugar Factory has begun construction.

The Nan'an Sugar Factory is a joint venture between the Fujian Provincial People's Government and patriotic overseas Chinese who love the cause of national construction. All basic construction work is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and it will officially go into production in January next year. The factory is expected to produce about 2,000 tons of high-quality white sugar with a sugar content of 99.75% per year. In addition to fully meeting the needs of the people of Fujian Province, it can also be partially transported and sold to other regions. This will fundamentally change the unreasonable situation in the past where the province exported brown sugar and imported granulated sugar from other provinces.

The Nan'an Sugar Factory is located in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, which is rich in sugarcane. The area within 20 miles of the factory is full of lush sugarcane fields. After the factory is completed, sugarcane farmers will deliver the freshly cut sugarcane on the same day directly to the factory along the Jinjiang River, where it can be quickly squeezed to improve the sugar extraction rate.

### 公私合营福建南安糖厂动工兴建

    公私合营福建南安糖厂动工兴建
    公私合营福建南安糖厂已开始动工兴建。
    南安糖厂是福建省人民政府与热爱祖国建设事业的华侨合资建设的，全部基本建设工程预计在年底完工，明年一月将正式投入生产。该厂预计一年可出产含糖分百分之九十九点七五的上等白砂糖两千吨左右，除了充分供应福建省人民需要外，还可部分运销外地。这样将根本改变过去本省输出土糖、又由省外输入砂糖的不合理状况。
    南安糖厂设在福建省盛产甘蔗的南安县，附近二十里地区全是茂密的蔗林。该厂建成后，蔗农将把当天砍下来的新鲜甘蔗，沿着晋江直接送到厂里，经迅速压榨，可提高出糖率。
