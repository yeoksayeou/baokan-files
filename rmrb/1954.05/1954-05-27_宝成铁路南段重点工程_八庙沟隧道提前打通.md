Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 26th: The longest tunnel on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Eight Mile Gulch Tunnel, was completely excavated three months ahead of schedule on May 22nd.

	The Eight Mile Gulch Tunnel, located in the high mountains of the Daba Mountains, is a key project on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Starting in November 1952, the workers excavating the tunnel battled the formidable Daba Mountains on the cliffs, with ropes tied around their waists. They successively created advanced working methods such as the "lime water quenching drill method," "salt water quenching drill method," and "center blasting method," which greatly improved work efficiency. Technicians also actively adopted advanced tunnel excavation methods introduced by Soviet experts, such as the "funnel scaffolding excavation method" and the "upper and lower heading excavation method," and solved ventilation and transportation problems. In 1953, the tunnel workers overfulfilled the annual plan by 34 percent. This year, a red flag competition to reach the center point first was launched at the north and south entrances, and new records for tunnel excavation continued to emerge. In mid-May, the daily progress of heading excavation at both the south and north entrances of the tunnel simultaneously increased to more than five meters, which is about double the daily progress of more than two meters in the first quarter of this year.

    宝成铁路南段重点工程
    八庙沟隧道提前打通
    据新华社成都二十六日电：宝成铁路南段最长的隧道——八庙沟隧道已提前三个月在五月二十二日全部打通。
    八庙沟隧道在大巴山系的崇山峻岭中，是宝成铁路南段的重点工程。从一九五二年十一月开始，开凿隧道的工人们就在悬岩绝壁上，用绳索系着腰，向顽强的大巴山展开了战斗。他们先后创造了
  “石灰水淬钎法”、“盐水淬钎法”、“中心放炮法”等先进的工作法，使工作效率大大提高。技术人员们也积极采用苏联专家介绍的先进的隧道开挖方法——“漏斗棚架开挖法”和“上下导坑开挖法”等，并解决了通风和运输问题。一九五三年隧道工人们超额百分之三十四完成了年度计划。今年南北口展开了先到中心点的红旗竞赛，开凿隧道的新纪录更是不断出现。五月中，隧道南口和北口的导坑开挖日进尺都同时提高到五公尺以上，比今年第一季度每天开挖两公尺多提高了一倍左右。
