The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened a municipal factory cafeteria work conference on May 10th. More than 780 people attended the meeting, including trade union cadres, administrative personnel, cafeteria managers, cooks, and relevant health personnel from various state-owned, joint state-private, and some private factories.

Li Musheng, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Zhou Bi, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and Duan Jinping, Deputy Director of the Labor Insurance Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, all spoke at the meeting. The meeting considered: Cafeteria work is an important task. The success or failure of cafeteria work directly affects the physical health and lives of employees, and is also related to the factory's production. However, even now, some factory leaders do not pay enough attention to this work, and many cafeteria staff and cooks are not settled in their jobs and do not pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The meeting believed that grassroots factory leaders must strengthen ideological education for cooks to enhance their socialist consciousness; trade union leaders should also organize cooks to carry out labor competitions in a planned way, to enhance their enthusiasm for labor and a high degree of work initiative, and to improve cafeteria work on the existing basis. At the same time, it is necessary to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene, pay attention to nutrition, so that cafeteria work is oriented towards production and the physical health of employees, and serves the completion of national production tasks. Cafeteria work should also save cooking oil, reduce costs, and fully utilize the nutritional value of existing food expenses.

    上海召开工厂食堂工作会议
    上海市人民政府卫生局和上海总工会，在五月十日联合召开了本市工厂食堂工作会议。出席会议的有：各国营、公私合营和部分私营工厂的工会干部、行政人员、食堂管理人员、炊事员和有关卫生人员等七百八十多人。
    上海市卫生局李穆生副局长、上海总工会周璧秘书长、上海总工会劳保部段金平副部长，都在会上讲了话。会议认为：食堂工作是一项重要工作，食堂工作搞得好坏，直接影响职工的身体健康和生活。也关系到工厂的生产。但是直到现在有些厂矿领导对这一工作不重视，有不少食堂工作人员和炊事员不安心于自己的工作，不重视清洁卫生。会议认为基层厂矿领导必须对炊事人员加强思想教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟；工会领导也要有计划地组织炊事人员开展劳动竞赛，以此提高他们劳动热情和高度的工作积极性，把食堂工作在现有基础上办好。同时必须搞好清洁卫生，注意营养，使食堂工作面向生产，面向职工身体健康，为完成国家生产任务而服务。食堂工作并应节约食油，降低成本，充分发挥现有伙食费用的营养价值。
