Guanting Youth
Zi Gang

	In the Guanting Mountain Gorge in March, the wind blows without a hint of spring. People have to wear scarves and hats when they go out. A gust of wind brings a yellow haze of dust, and the yellow sand on the banks of the Yongding River buries ankles.

	My little companion, Yan Chunfu, laughed when he heard that I wanted to take him out for a stroll in this weather. His nimble little eyes smiled, and his wrinkled hands, used to carrying coal and water, pinched the corners of his black cotton-padded jacket, neither agreeing nor refusing.

	The other two comrades from the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau's guesthouse spoke up:
	“Go ahead, we'll do your work for you!”

	Yan Chunfu looked up at me and voiced his concerns:
	“What can I explain to you? You've already heard the director's report and seen enough of the dam and intake tower with the engineers, haven't you?”
	“You can explain better than them,” I laughed. “If you weren’t afraid of the cold, let’s go.” He no longer hesitated, and we stumbled down the hillside.

	This sixteen-year-old young man was very confident. He put his hands in the side pockets of his short cotton jacket and said:
	“You say I'm afraid of the cold? Not at all! I wear this short cotton jacket even in winter. My mom made it, and it's all brand new! I bought a scarf, but I'm not used to wearing it. It's hot and prickly, and it itches, so I gave it to my little sister.”
	“You're a good brother,” I said.

	He narrowed his eyes into slits, puffed out his chest, but muttered as if talking to himself: “I went back home during the Spring Festival. My older sister got married and didn't come home. I felt like a distant guest. My dad inquired about the reservoir project, my mom stewed meat and steamed cakes, my younger brother wanted me to look at his third-grade textbook, and that little sister, she kept calling me 'Brother, Brother' and wouldn't leave my side…”
	“Being a brother is really impressive!”
	“It's not impressive for long.” His feet, clad in large fur-lined shoes, kicked around in the soft yellow sand. “Later, the reservoir workers took two trucks to visit the folks in Guanting Village for the New Year, and I quickly hitched a ride back with them.” He paused, his eyes flashing with doubt, and asked me: “Why is this, I've only been at the engineering bureau for a little over a year, but it feels like I can't leave. I keep thinking: What guests have arrived? Has the stove in the guest room gone out? Is there enough water?…” He perked up his ears to listen to the roaring of the generator on the west bank of the river, and chuckled: “Even when I sleep on the kang in the village at night, it’s too quiet. I can’t hear the roaring, and my ears feel empty!”

	The wind subsided a little. The yellow sand, having danced enough, slowly settled. I said to Yan Chunfu: “In the future, when the Yongding River is harnessed, there won't be so much silt, and there won't be any more floods!”
	“Everything will change,” Yan Chunfu said. Spotting the long, reinforced concrete spillway ahead, he pointed to a spot on the spillway and said:
	“That used to be old Guanting Village, that used to be our home!” His young eyes suddenly looked clearer than ever, radiating light, and his cheeks, already slightly red, became even redder. He seemed to believe that with a point of his finger, I would see the poor mountain village that once existed on this hillside, with two or three small earthen houses that used to be the home of his family. Yes, under his joyful pointing, I seemed to be led into a fairy-tale world, remembering the story of the witch's magic wand that could conjure up anything it pointed at. Yan Chunfu may not have heard such fairy tales, but he saw the even more attractive reality of the socialist construction era.

	From childhood, he had grown accustomed to hearing people talk about water. Water often swallowed people's lives and the fruits of their labor. Before liberation, people often saw empty talkers come to Guanting Mountain Gorge to "inspect," and drilling teams lived in Guanting Village for a while. But the Yongding River's flood disasters remained the same. The folks in Guanting Village had been fooled enough! After liberation, the People's Government kept its word, and the reservoir officially started construction in October 1951. The Guanting Reservoir is an important part of the entire project. Guanting Village is high up and won't be submerged, but the spillway needs to be built here. So, for the benefit of the vast people downstream, and to comply with the government's construction plan, more than fifty families in Guanting Village moved en masse to Dahuangzhuang, more than eighty miles away! In order to store water in the reservoir, more than one hundred villages in Huailai and Yanqing counties, with a population of more than 60,000, who were to be submerged, were also relocated one after another.

	We walked in the empty spillway. Speaking loudly here, there would be an echo. I thought, this child who grew up in this mountain village had discovered the truth: everything will change. The red and yellow badges of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau and the trade union, which he proudly wore on his chest, were also evidence of "change," weren't they?
	“This spillway is twenty meters wide and four hundred and thirty-one meters long! We have to walk a long way.” My little companion earnestly took on his guide duties. He spoke exactly like the engineers, but often added the words “I heard”. “I heard that this spillway is the safety gate of the dam. If the flood is too big, or if there is a problem with the intake tower's gate, the water will be released here and then flow away.” He told me in detail that the height of the dam was four hundred and eighty-five meters, and that the water level of the reservoir after storing water would be about four hundred and eighty-three meters.
	“I heard that these are elevation meters, calculated relative to the Bohai Sea. If calculated from the bottom of the river, the dam is forty-five meters high.”
	“You're really great, you talk just like an engineer.”

	He smiled slightly, a very sincere smile. “Rely on the mountain to eat from the mountain, rely on the water to eat from the water. Director Wang wants each of us correspondents to learn some water conservancy knowledge. If we are to serve the Guanting Reservoir, it would be shameful if we couldn’t explain why the reservoir was built and how it was built later on!” He painted a picture of the labor scene of tens of thousands of workers last year in great detail, "Not counting all kinds of machines, 600 large trucks and 2,000 donkeys were also busy transporting materials."

	He looked up at the top of the concrete wall:
	“Look there, that used to be a Dragon King Temple, and later it became the construction site's canteen. The villages near Guanting Village didn't have much to spare, but they had plenty of Dragon King Temples and Guanyin Temples. Our culture class teacher said: In the old society, the reactionaries couldn't control the water, so they tricked the people into worshiping Bodhisattvas. But we in Guanting Village are an old revolutionary base area, and we stopped believing in that long ago!"

	Yan Chunfu also had the proud demeanor of the people of the old liberated areas, which was a very healthy and natural emotion. Little Yan Chunfu had also participated in the children's corps and fought against the enemy puppets. He hadn't had peaceful days without worry since he was a child. His father participated in the revolution, and he sometimes helped by running errands and delivering letters, and he also had to serve as a labor force, farming the land, pruning fruit trees, and driving a small donkey. "Later, even the little donkey was taken away, and my aunt (father's sister-in-law) was killed by the Kuomintang outside a cave. We didn't dare stay home all day long, and sometimes we slept on the rocks on the hillside even on cold nights. My mother was often carrying a nursing baby." In the year that Yan Chunfu was eleven years old, Huailai County was liberated, and the family was reunited: his father returned to the village from outside, and his mother led a group of children back to the village from their maternal grandparents' home in Sangyuan.
	“Come and visit our Dahuangzhuang New Guanting Village sometime, the government built neat and tidy new houses for us.” We sat down on a hillside to rest, and Yan Chunfu suggested to me. He seemed to dislike talking about his past very much. He said, “Who wants to talk about things from eight hundred lifetimes ago, it's all about starving and suffering, to hell with it.” He grabbed a handful of dead grass, rubbed it to pieces in his hand, and threw it away.
	“My family was allocated fifteen mu of land. Dahuangzhuang has paddy fields for growing rice, which were opened up by the People's Liberation Army. The harvest was not very good in the first year; last year's harvest was too much for every family to eat, so my dad and I discussed it and sold 3,000 jin of surplus grain!”
	“Aren’t there about twenty young people from your Guanting Village working at the engineering bureau? These families are probably the richest families in the village!” I recalled the “blood ties” between their village and this reservoir.

	“Almost! I can also send more than ten yuan home every month.” Yan Chunfu nodded, smiling so beautifully. “Ma Fuyou, Ma Cheng, Fan Zhen, Wang Yongzhu… Some people learned drilling, some people learned electrical work, Fan Zhen learned to be a driver, Wang Yongzhu is the tall correspondent you know…”
	“Isn’t Fan Zhen a model correspondent?” I recalled him being mentioned in the construction site newspaper.

	“He’s a driver now.” The sun made his eyes shine brightly. “Didn't I say that everything will change! Believe it or not, in another year or two, Wang Yongzhu and I might also learn some kind of skill. Didn't you hear Director Wang and Comrade Wang Sen say: Guanting Reservoir is a school, and it has trained about a thousand technical talents in two or three years? Director Wang also said: Building the reservoir transforms nature and transforms people. These are our two major victories.” He slapped his knees and said, “That's so right!”

	I suddenly seemed to understand a bit of his thought process, so I probed:
	“You little guy, you’re a little restless at work, aren’t you? Being a correspondent is also part of the revolutionary work!”

	“Don't accuse me wrongly,” he said anxiously: “When I was crushing coal, adding fire, carrying water, and cleaning the auditorium, I thought that way. I was happy to serve the guests who came to Guanting, even though I haven't added a shovel of material to the dam or poured a bit of concrete into the aqueduct spillway, I feel like the master. I grew up in this place, I'm young, but I've experienced a lot. I can tell you: I herded sheep on which small hillside, and I drove donkeys on which mountain road. I can tell you: we cleaned up the enemies in which mountain areas. There are a lot of dates, apricots, pears, apples, crabapples, grapes, and persimmons in these mountains, and they are all fragrant and sweet varieties. Many folks in Guanting Village couldn't bear to part with the dozens of fruit trees in each family, so it was so difficult to relocate. Well, later the government bought the trees at a discounted price, and now these trees belong to the public. Will you come back in a while? These trees will bloom in a row, always with apricot blossoms leading the way, blooming in patches competing with each other. The engineers said: In the future, trees will be planted around the reservoir, fish will be raised in the water, and people will row boats on the lake, and it will be so beautiful to swim! When people are tired or sick, they can all come to Guanting to stay. Our Guanting is famous, and there are not many houses for recuperation yet, but many people come to visit: not only Chinese people, but also many foreigners, all coming to see how we Chinese are doing water conservancy infrastructure and how we are building socialism!”
	“Look how far you're talking, you're off the topic!”

	We stood up and walked towards the stilling basin, but Yan Chunfu was defending himself:
	“I'm not off the topic, I said I'm willing to be a correspondent here. But the project is about to be completed, so I can't stay here forever. Director Wang said that Wang Yongzhu and I have a poor education, so we were assigned to be correspondents as soon as we came, and we are studying in the culture class. When the project is completed in the future, who knows where we will be assigned and what kind of skill we will learn!” The child simply jumped down the hillside and walked towards the stilling basin. At the edge of this waterfall-like stilling basin, he told me for a while about its function of reducing flow velocity. Then, as if the rushing water triggered his memory:

	“Here, last spring, we were building the stilling basin, and it kept leaking. Later, the news of Stalin's death came, and everyone cried. Some workers from Chahar recalled that Comrade Stalin had sent Soviet experts to treat the plague for them, and swore that they would not stop until it didn't leak. Later, they soaked in the cold water for a day and a night and completed the task - that's how they commemorated Stalin!”
	He went on to say that he often encountered Soviet experts in his work. "When we do something for them, they always say thank you, even if it's just bringing a pot of water! They shake hands with us and also give us commemorative medals - the people sent by Stalin are just different."
	“Didn’t you just write an article about ‘Commemorating the First Anniversary of Stalin’s Death’?”
	He thought for a while before understanding: “You must have seen the topic our teacher wrote on the blackboard!” A trace of sadness suddenly appeared between his eyebrows: “I have so much to say, but I just can't write it, I don't know enough characters, and I can't form sentences! My Chinese grades can't keep up with arithmetic, it makes me angry when I think about it!"

	I couldn't help but laugh in his face. He stared at me, as if he thought I was laughing unnecessarily. I said:
	“Don’t worry, study slowly, and you will definitely be able to write a lot in the future, long articles!”
	“I like pictures, I’ve read enough of the comic books in our library.”
	“You will definitely be able to draw in the future, as long as you practice hard, it's not difficult to find a teacher in the engineering bureau.”

	I thought to myself that such a child will not only be able to write in the future, but will also be able to draw. The mountain gorge he grew up in, the Yongding River, and the many varieties of fruit trees are like being in a painting with extraordinary atmosphere and colors. Now, this painting has erased the poor villages and broken temples and added reservoirs - man-made lakes and power plants. The epic scene should also be embellished with these teenagers from Guanting Village, some of whom are engaged in agricultural labor in the new Guanting Village in Dahuangzhuang, and some of whom have come out, learned different skills, and done different jobs. Society seems to be opening its doors to them, reaching out its arms, and they, like chicks just out of their shells, open their eyes and say:
	“Wow, the world is so broad!”

	On the way back to the guesthouse, Yan Chunfu quickened his pace, he had new plans: he would practice riding his bicycle for a while before dinner, this was a new thing he had to get familiar with in the last few days.
	He also told me that he was carrying out another major task: applying to join the Communist Youth League. In the past two or three years, the League branch of the Engineering Bureau has absorbed about 500 League members. Yan Chunfu has this ambition: after leaving Guanting Reservoir as a member of the Communist Youth League, he will go to other construction sites.

	The wind stopped and the sun set, and the gorges reflected the bright orange-yellow afterglow that painters could hardly mix.

    官厅少年
    子冈
    三月里的官厅山峡，刮起风来，还没有一丝春意。人们出门还得围上围巾、戴上帽子。一阵风吹过来，眼前黄呼呼一片尘雾，永定河边上的黄沙埋过脚踝。
    我的小同伴严春富听说我要在这种天气里拉他出去蹓躂蹓躂，睁着一双灵活的小眼睛尽笑，成天价捶煤提水的两只发绉的手捏着对襟黑棉袄的衣角，不说去，也不说不去。
    倒是官厅水库工程局招待所的另外两位通讯员同志说话了：
      “去嘛，有活我们替你干就是了！”
    严春富抬眼瞅一瞅我，说出了他的思想顾虑：
      “我能给你解释个啥哩？你不是听过了局长的报告，跟着工程师们把大坝、进水塔什么的都看够了么？”
      “你比他们更能说呀，”我笑起来，“若不是怕冷，就走吧。”他不再犹疑，我们便踉踉跄跄地跑下山坡去了。
    这个十六岁的年青人很自负，一边把双手插在短棉袄左右腰兜里，一边说：
      “你说我怕冷？才不哩！过冬也是这件短棉袄，妈给絮的，里面三新！围巾买过一条，可是围不惯，又热、又扎扎虎虎，怪痒痒的，送给我小妹妹了。”
      “真是个好哥哥。”我说。
    他眼睛眯成一条缝，挺一挺胸脯，嘴里却只像说给自己听似的在叨咕着：“过春节时候我回去了。姐姐出嫁了，也没回家。我好像成了远客啦。爹打听水库的工程，妈给炖肉蒸糕，弟弟要我看他的小学三年级课本，那个小妹妹，哥哥长哥哥短围着我转……”
    “做个哥哥可真威风！”
    “没有威风几天哪。”他那双穿着大毛窝的脚在松软的黄沙里踢蹬着玩。“后来水库的职工们坐了两辆卡车给我们官厅村的老乡去贺年，我就赶紧搭他们车回来啦。”他顿了一顿，闪着疑问的眼光问我：“你说这是咋搞的，我也才来工程局一年多些啊，倒像是离不开了似的，心里老想着：又来了什么客人哩，客屋里炉子灭了没有，水还缺不缺。……”他又支楞着耳朵听一听河西发电机的轰隆轰隆的响声，嘿嘿地乐起来：“就说晚上在村子里炕上睡觉，也是安静的不行，听不见轰隆轰隆，耳朵里空得慌！”
    风小了一点，漫天黄沙舞够了，慢慢静止下来。我对严春富说：“往后，修好了永定河，泥沙也不会这么多了，就别提洪水！”
      “什么都会变的。”严春富说。瞥见前面钢筋混凝土浇成的长长的溢洪道了，他手指着溢洪道上的一点说：
    “那上面，就曾经是旧官厅村，就曾经是我们的家！”他的一双年轻的眼睛忽然显得比任何时候都澄澈，在散射出光辉，本来微红的两颊也更红通通的了。他仿佛相信，凭他的手一指，我就会看见往日在这山坡上错落地存在过的穷山村，其中两三间小土房又曾经是他们一家人的安身处。是的，在他这愉快的一指之下，我也仿佛被领进了童话的世界，记起女巫的魔杖指什么出现什么的故事来了。严春富也许没有听过这样的童话故事，他却看到了社会主义建设时代更有吸引力的现实了。
    他从小时候起就听惯了人们谈论水的故事。水往往吞没了人的生命和人的劳动成果。解放以前，人们常常看到空谈家们来官厅山峡“视察”，钻探队也到官厅村来生活过一阵。可是永定河的水患依然如故。官厅村的老乡们被骗够了！解放以后，人民政府说到做到，一九五一年十月水库正式开工。官厅水库是全部工程的重要部分。官厅村地势高，淹不着，但是这里该修溢洪道。于是，为了下游广大人民的利益，为了服从政府的建设计划，官厅村的五十多家人家便一古脑儿搬了家，搬到八十里地以外的大黄庄去了！为了水库蓄水，将要淹没的怀来、延庆两县上百个村子的六万多人口都陆续迁移了。
    我们走在空荡荡的溢洪道里，在这儿高声说话，会有回声。我想，在这个山村里长大的孩子发现了真理：什么都会变的。他带着几分炫耀挂在胸前的官厅水库工程局和工会的两个红黄色证章，不也是“变”的证据么？
      “这个溢洪道，有二十公尺宽、四百三十一公尺长哩！我们得走好大一会子。”我的小同伴认真地执行起他的向导职务来了，他说得和工程师说的一丝不差，不过常常加上“我听说”三个字。“我听说，这个溢洪道是拦河坝的保险门哩，若是洪水太大，或是进水塔的闸门有了毛病，就把水放进这里来，然后流走。”他又絮絮地告诉我那个拦河坝的坝高是四百八十五公尺，以后水库蓄水的水高大约是四百八十三公尺。
    “我听说，这是海拔公尺，和渤海比着算的。要是从河底算，这坝高是四十五公尺。”
      “你真棒啊，说得赛个工程师似的。”
    他微微一笑，笑得挺真诚。“靠山吃山，靠水吃水啊。王局长要我们每个通讯员学点水利常识。给官厅水库来服务，赶后来说也说不清修水库为了啥，咋个修法，看多丢人！”他又不厌其详地为我描画去年几万工人的劳动场面，“各式各样机器不算，大车六百辆、毛驴两千头也忙着给运材料呢。”
    他仰头看看混凝土墙壁的上边：
    “瞧那里，以前是个龙王庙，后来作了工地大伙房。这官厅村附近的几个村子，什么也不敷余，就是敷余龙王庙、观音庙的。我们文化班老师说：在旧社会里，反动派治不了水，就骗老百姓拜菩萨。——我们官厅村可是老区，早不信这个了！”
    严春富也有着老解放区人民的自豪的气派，这是很健康很自然的情绪。小小的严春富，也参加过儿童团，和敌伪斗争过。他自小就没过过太太平平不耽心的日子，爸爸参加了革命，他有时也帮忙跑腿送信，还得顶个劳动力使唤，种点地，修整果树，赶个小毛驴。“后来倒好，小毛驴也被牵走了，我大娘（伯母）被国民党打死在一个窑洞外边。我们成天不敢挨家，有时大冷天晚上也在山坡石头片上睡，我娘还常是带着吃奶的娃娃呢。”在严春富十一岁那年怀来县解放了，一家子才团了圆：爸爸从外面回村，妈妈领着一群孩子从姥姥家住的桑园回村。
      “什么时候你上我们大黄庄新官厅村去看看吧，政府为我们盖的整整齐齐的新房子。”我们在一个山坡上坐下来歇歇脚，严春富向我提议，他似乎顶不喜欢顶不喜欢谈他的过去，他说：“谁高兴说那八百辈子以前的事啊，尽是挨饿受罪的事，去他的吧。”他抓起一把枯草，在手心里揉了个稀烂，扔着玩。
      “我家分了十五亩地，大黄庄有种稻子的水地，是解放军开的渠哩，头一年收成不很好；去年收的家家吃不完，我和爹一商量，我家卖了三千斤余粮！”
    “你们官厅村不是有二十来个年轻人在工程局工作么？恐怕这些人家是村上最富裕的人家了！”我记起他们村上和这个水库的“血缘”来。
      “差不多吧！我一个月也能捎十几万元给家里。”严春富点点头，笑得那么美好。“马富有、马成、范珍、王永珠……有些人学了钻探，有些人学了电工，范珍学了司机，王永珠就是你认识的那个高个子通讯员……”
    “范珍不是个模范通讯员么？”我记起工地报纸上提到过他。
    “人家是个司机啦，”太阳照得他的眼睛明晃晃的。“我不是说过，什么都会变的啊！不信，再过一二年，王永珠和我，说不定也学上什么技术啦。你没听王局长、王森同志说：官厅水库是个学校，二三年里培养了靠一千个技术人才了？王局长还说：修水库改造了自然，也改造了人，这是我们的两大胜利。”他拍了一下双膝说：“太正确啦！”
    我忽然听出了一点他的思想活动似的，就试探他：
    “你这小家伙，有点不安心工作吧？做个通讯员也是革命工作的一部分啊！”
    “你别冤枉人啊，”他急了：“在我捶煤、添火、提水、打扫礼堂的时候都是那样想的，我高兴为到官厅来的客人服务，虽然我没有为拦河坝添过
  一铲料，没有为输水道溢洪道浇灌过一点点混凝土，可是我心里就赛个主人似的。我生长在这个地方，人小，经历的事可不少。我可以告诉你们：我在哪块小山坡上放过羊，我在哪块小山路上赶过毛驴。我可以告诉你们：我们在哪些片山地上收拾过敌人。这山里的枣、杏、梨、苹果、沙果、葡萄、柿子可不少，又都是又香又甜的好种，多少官厅村的老乡都是为了舍不得家家的几十棵果树，所以迁移的时候才那么难受。好了，后来政府折价买了树，现在这些树是公家的了。过些时候你还来不来？这些树会排着队似的开花的，总是杏花打头，一片片赛着开。工程师们说：以后要把水库周围种上树，水里养上鱼，人在湖上划起船来，游得那个美！人累了、病了、全可以上官厅来住住。我们官厅可出了名啦，如今休养的房子还盖得不多，参观人可来得不少：中国人来不算，外国人也来得挺多，都来瞧咱们中国人咋样在搞水利基本建设，咋样在建设社会主义啦！”
    “瞧你说得够多远啊，离了题了！”
    我们站起来向静水池走去，严春富却在辩解：
    “没有离题哪，我说我愿意在这儿当通讯员哩。可是，工程是就要完的，不能赖着不走哇。王局长说王永珠和我文化程度太差，所以一来就分配了当通讯员，一边在文化班学习，将来工程一完，知道会分配到哪，学个什么技术呢！”这孩子简直是蹦跳着下的山坡，向静水池那边走去了。到了这个瀑布一样的静水池边，他又给我讲了一阵它的减低流速的作用。然后，仿佛哗哗的流水触起了他的回忆：
    “在这里，去年春天正修静水池，修来修去总漏水。后来传来了斯大林逝世的消息，大家全哭了，有的察北工人想起斯大林同志派苏联专家给他们治鼠疫的事来，发誓说，一定要修得不漏水才算。后来，他们在冷水里泡了一天一夜，把任务完成了——就这么着纪念了斯大林！”
    他接着说，在他的工作中也常常遇到苏联专家。“为他们作点事，他们总说谢谢哩，那怕是送一壶水！他们和我们握手，还送我们纪念章，——斯大林派来的人，就是有些不同呢。”
      “你们不是刚刚作过‘纪念斯大林逝世一周年’的文章么？”
    他想了一想才明白过来：“你一定是看到我们老师写在黑板上的题目了！”眉宇间忽然显出一点忧愁的神气：“我有多少话要说呀，可就是写不出来，生字不够用，写不成句子！我的语文成绩赶不过算术，想起来叫人生气！”
    我忍不住当了他的面笑起来，他瞠着眼，好像嫌我笑得多余。我说：
    “别急，慢慢学习，以后你一定很会写呢，写长篇长篇的！”
      “我喜欢图画，我们图书馆里的连环图画，被我看够了。”
    “你将来一定也能画，只要用心练习，在工程局找个老师也不难。”
    我暗想，这样的孩子，将来不但能写，一定也会画的。他依傍着生长的这个山峡、这条永定河，这些品种繁多的果树林，就像是在一幅气魄和色调都不平凡的画里一样。现在这幅画上抹去了穷村破庙，添上了水库——人造湖和发电厂。点缀在这张史诗般的画面上的，还应该有官厅村的这些青少年们，他们有的在大黄庄的新官厅村从事着农业劳动，有的就走了出来，学了不同的技术，作了不同的工作，社会好似向他们打开着大门，伸开着两臂，他们呢，像才出蛋壳的小鸡雏一样，睁开眼睛说：
   “咦，世界是这样宽广啊！”
    走回招待所的道上，严春富加快了脚步，他又有了新的打算：乘晚饭前他要练一会儿自行车，这是最近几天他要熟悉的一件新事物。
    他还曾告诉我，他进行着另一件重大的工作：正在申请入团。二三年来工程局团总支吸收了五百名左右团员。严春富有这个雄心：自己要以青年团员的身分在离开官厅水库后，再到别的建设工地去。
    风止日落，山峡间辉映着画师们难以调配的发亮的橘黄霞光。
