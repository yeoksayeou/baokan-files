The Zunhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to lead and assist district cadres and county-level cadres working in rural areas in their study of current events, policies, and theory, adopted the method of a political study report station starting in December 1952. This study method has been maintained for over a year, and the facts prove that this is a successful experience worthy of great attention.

The study report station was established on a trial basis in October 1952. At that time, the entire county was studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Malenkov's report. The third part of Comrade Malenkov's report was closely related to the party rectification work being carried out in the county at that time. In order to help everyone study in depth and overcome the difficulties of cadre dispersion and inconvenient transportation, after several repeated studies, the county party committee decided to establish eight report stations on a trial basis throughout the county. Six members of the county party committee, one theory instructor, and the director of the county cooperative were appointed as reporters, and they went to each station to give reports.

The first report was warmly welcomed by the vast number of cadres, who unanimously requested the county party committee to continue this system. The district committee also reported this experience and urged the Zunhua County Party Committee to continue to improve it so that it could be regularized. In this way, the Zunhua County Party Committee further studied the system of the study report station, revised and supplemented the first decision, and changed the provision of making a report once a week on Thursday to an irregular reporting system (approximately once a month as needed by the work); it was also decided to increase the number of report stations by two, so that each district had one; six more reporters were added, and a reporter group was established, with the secretary of the county party committee serving as the group leader. Later, the county party committee further stipulated that the reports given by the reporters must be closely combined with the inspection and deployment of work, and the reporting time should be as consistent as possible with the time when district cadres are concentrated in the district to report their work. After the report, discussions should be combined to help the district committee deploy the work of the entire district. Since then, the system of the Zunhua County Study Report Station has been formally established.

I. Content, Methods, and Systems of Reports at the Study Report Station

Since the establishment of the station, the content of the reports in Zunhua County has mainly focused on current events and policy education, combined with the current central work. In 1952, during the party rectification, the report station reported on the part of Malenkov's "Report on the Work Summary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress" concerning the international situation and the part concerning rural economy and party work, for a total of three reports. During the "Marriage Law Implementation Month," the report station reported on several issues related to the Marriage Law once. During the spring plowing production, the report station reported on the central government's instructions on spring plowing production. In the work of opposing bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, and rectifying rural mutual aid and cooperation, the report station conveyed Comrade Deng Zihui's report and relevant documents on mutual aid and cooperation and agricultural production. This stage of study lasted the longest and had the most reports. Later, the report station made reports on the Korean armistice, agricultural tax collection, and increasing production and practicing economy. When studying the Party's General Line in the Transition Period of the State, the number of people listening to the report was even greater, and the number of times the county party committee went to the districts to report also increased.

The content of each report is determined by the county party committee. One education cadre from the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee is responsible for collecting relevant ideological problems and work conditions of cadres in various districts and assisting the County Party Committee in drafting report outlines (sometimes with the assistance of theory instructors). Then, the method of collective lesson preparation is adopted, and a meeting of the reporter group is convened to determine the teaching method. Before the report, the reporter first studies the report outline, and after arriving in the district, combines it with the specific situation reported by the district party committee to make the report. After the report, the district party committee collects opinions and questions after listening to the report and reflects them to the reporter in order to improve and answer them. When reporting, relevant policy documents, People's Daily editorials, and articles introducing work experience are also selected as required or reference documents for study. The regular study time is one and a half hours per day, and political study is conducted on three mornings a week, and culture is studied on three mornings. The secretary of the district party committee takes the lead in studying and combines it with the actual study of relevant work problems. The district party committees and work teams working in the countryside study together and help the study of nearby township cadres. When district cadres return to the agency, the district party committee not only checks their work but also checks their study. In addition, a system of special tutoring, testing, and commendation and criticism has been established.

II. Main Gains of the Study

First, it has improved the political and ideological level of cadres. When studying the "Party" part of Malenkov's report, the "down the mountain" (xiashan) thought of the cadres was corrected, the study results after the "Three Antis" were consolidated, criticism and self-criticism were widely carried out, and the unity of the cadres was strengthened. For example, Ai Min, secretary of the Second District Party Committee, said that in the past, he emphasized the shortcomings of others and rarely reviewed his own shortcomings. Therefore, the district committee members were not united enough, and the collective leadership was not sound. When the county party committee went to give a report, they made sharp criticisms to them. After studying Malenkov's report, the district committee members made profound self-criticisms, and a meeting of all district cadres was convened to conduct criticism and self-criticism universally, and everyone was called upon to put forward opinions on the leadership of the district committee. Since then, the District Party Committee has made criticism and self-criticism a system, and after the end of each central task, the District Party Committee members have to conduct a review of each other. Now the unity of the cadres in the Second District is stronger than before, and the work enthusiasm of the cadres is higher than before. In 1952, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was developed, but the cadres were not clear about the direction of agricultural production development, their understanding of the mutual aid and cooperation policy was poor, and they did not have experience in running societies; in addition, the policy thinking of some cadres who rectified production cooperatives was chaotic, and the handling of social problems was inappropriate, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. Based on these circumstances, the county party committee decided to lead cadres to study various documents related to mutual aid and cooperation and organize reporters to make reports on mutual aid and cooperation. The county party committee went to the districts in person to specifically help each district rectify the old societies and establish new societies. Judging from the study of the mutual aid and cooperation policy in the county as a whole, the process of studying the policy is also the process of doing a good job in mutual aid and cooperation to correct deviations, and it is also the process of training cadres. According to statistics, before the spring of 1953, among the more than 400 district cadres and county-level cadres working in rural areas in the county, less than 20 people were able to rectify agricultural production cooperatives. After a year of studying the mutual aid and cooperation policy, more than 100 people have been able to rectify and organize agricultural production cooperatives.

The study of the general line had a wider scope and greater results. A total of 30,000 cadres, party members, league members, and propagandists in the county studied the general line. In addition to the work conference, six reports were made through the report station. County reporters also used the "apprenticeship" method to train 110 cadres who could make reports (reporters for the study of the general line). On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of the cadres, the county successfully completed the task of unified purchase and marketing, and encouraged the enthusiasm of the majority of farmers to organize and develop production. On the basis of more than 100 old societies, more than 300 societies were developed.

Second, it has improved work methods. The study station system has first played a great role in the county party committee's in-depth understanding of reality and overcoming bureaucracy. Because county party committee comrades often go to the districts, they have strengthened the connection between county and district cadres and reduced unnecessary meetings. As Zhao Yongxing, secretary of the Tenth District Party Committee, said, "In the past, the secretary of the district party committee, the district chief, the armed forces minister, the youth league branch secretary, and the women's federation director had to go to the county for several days of meetings every month, and after returning to the district, they had to transmit according to the system, which took a lot of time, and there was little time left for actual work in a month." After the establishment of the station, the county party committee combined reporting with the deployment of work, which not only saved time but also helped the district with its work, and the district cadres were very satisfied. In the past, the phenomenon of the county backlog of letters from the masses was serious. After the establishment of the station, these letters were taken by the county party committee for processing or processed on the spot, and the masses were also very satisfied. There have also been many achievements in helping the district grasp policies and correct deviations. For example, in the early stage of the Marriage Law Implementation Month, a district chief rudely broke up early marriage men and women. The county party committee comrades went to report, and the problem was discovered and corrected in time. In terms of the division of labor of the county party committee members, the past was a district contracting system, but now it has been changed to a unified deployment and division of labor, and the cadres sent to the countryside are uniformly distributed according to the needs of the work, which not only grasps the central work but also takes care of the overall work. The cooperation of various departments in the central work has also been improved compared with the past. Because the cadres of the various economic departments can often hear the reports of the county party committee comrades, their political understanding has been improved, and the past tendency of emphasizing business and neglecting politics has been transformed to varying degrees. The work methods in the districts have also been greatly improved.

Third, the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres for learning is high, and their work enthusiasm has been improved. In the past, some people said, "Learning can't be drilled into," "It's too busy to learn, if you want to learn, you have to go to school," but now no one says that. The contradiction between work and study has been resolved from practical experience, and everyone feels that in order to do a good job, they must study. Cadres in the First District reflected: "The more you learn, the more you want to learn," "If you don't study for three days, you don't know how to open a meeting." Zhao Yongxing, secretary of the Tenth District Party Committee, said: "Work is like cutting vegetables, and learning is like sharpening a knife." All the cadres in the district agreed that "studying the general line makes the eyes brighter."

III. Several Basic Experiences

The problem of learning difficulties for district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside is a problem that has not been solved for a long time. The fact that the Zunhua County Study Report Station has been established for more than a year proves that this problem can be solved.

Zunhua's experience proves that the county party committee's emphasis is the main reason why the report station can persist and gradually consolidate. They have grasped three links: First, the county party committee is the core to form a reporter group, and the secretary of the county party committee serves as the group leader to urge the reporters to prepare the report seriously. Without a fixed reporter group and the lead of the county party committee, the report station may become a formality. Second, before all the reporters make a report, the county party committee should convene a meeting of all reporters to study the content and methods of the report, especially to determine the central topic of the report. Their lesson preparation is serious and solemn. Finally, the reporter's discipline is stipulated, one of which is that absence from class is not allowed without special accidents. In this way, the reporters are prevented from slackening off midway.

Experience has proved that the content of the report must be closely combined with the current work and the main thoughts of the cadres, and theory must be linked to practice. The reporters go to the station to make reports in combination with the inspection of work, and it does not deviate from their own business, so they do not feel any burden. From the perspective of district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside, because the report is combined with work and cadres' thoughts, it is easy to understand and accept. The characteristics of the report are to focus on policies and expound theories, so that cadres can further clarify the policies; at the same time, it also aims at the deviations of cadres in the implementation and understanding of policies, and conducts necessary criticism to prevent and correct errors in the work. Such a report is a work report and also a study report. Generally speaking, it is ideologically strong and has combat effectiveness. This is the main reason why the report is welcomed.

Experience has proved that the report station is suitable for the work characteristics of district cadres and cadres sent to the countryside and their political and cultural level requirements. Because district cadres are scattered in the vast rural areas to carry out work, and some cadres in the county are also sent to the countryside for a long time to engage in central movements, their political and cultural level is low, and it is difficult to study without help. Therefore, some cadres feel distressed about learning and form an ideological burden. They need someone to provide specific help and guidance, and they need to be given regular explanations on major current events, policies, and theories. The establishment of the Zunhua Report Station has met their needs and solved their difficulties in learning and work.

Of course, the reporting time should not be mechanically stipulated, but should be subject to the needs of the current work and also according to the work arrangements of each district. In addition, someone in the propaganda department should be responsible for the work of the report station, collect information in a timely manner, and sort out the report materials.

IV. Existing Shortcomings and Directions of Efforts

The Zunhua Study Station still has some shortcomings. For example, some reporters talk too much about the content when giving reports, and the key points are not prominent; some reporters lack sufficient preparation before giving reports, and the connection with reality is not enough when reporting; and some discussions after reports are not serious enough, which affects the learning effect.

In the future, we should further strengthen the study of reporters in order to improve the ideological and policy level of reporters and the quality of the report. In terms of the content of the report, we should further pay attention to meeting the needs of the work. In addition to reporting on the central work in various periods, we should especially make special reports on the serious problems of a general nature that occur in the work. In terms of reporting methods, in addition to the individual making full preparations for the report and strengthening collective research, the report should also be tried out in a district before going to the station to report, and then the report should be divided into stations, so that the quality of the report can be improved. After each report, we should conscientiously organize discussions to consolidate the learning effect. Therefore, we must strengthen the tutoring work of the district party committee.

The district party committee is preparing to gradually establish study report stations in various counties. In order to summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner, Changli, Qian'an, Leting, and other counties have been identified as key counties. The district party committee also requires each county to gradually establish study report stations in each district, and each county should also establish one or two key districts in order to gain experience and then promote it.

    遵化县政治学习报告站成立一年多来的情况和经验
    中共唐山地委会
    中共河北省遵化县委为领导和帮助区干部和县级下乡干部进行时事、政策和理论学习，自一九五二年十二月起，采取了政治学习报告站的方法。这个学习方法已坚持了一年多，事实证明这是一项成功的经验，值得十分重视。
    学习报告站是在一九五二年十月试建的。当时全县正在学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件和马林科夫同志的报告。马林科夫同志报告的第三部分，与当时该县正在进行的整党工作有密切联系，为了帮助大家深入学习，克服干部分散和交通不便的困难，经过几次反复研究，县委确定在全县试行建立八个报告站，由县委委员六人、理论教员一人和县合作社主任一人担任报告员，分别到各站去作报告。
    第一次报告受到广大干部的热烈欢迎，他们一致要求县委把这种制度坚持下去。地委也通报了这一经验，并督促遵化县委继续改进，使其能够经常化。这样，遵化县委进一步研究学习报告站的制度，修改和补充了第一次的决定，把每星期四作一次报告的规定，改为不定期的报告制度（随着工作的需要，大约每月一次）；又决定增加报告站两处，作到每区一个；增加报告员六名，并成立报告员小组，由县委书记担任组长。以后县委又进一步规定，报告员到站作报告必须与检查、布置工作紧密结合，报告时间尽量与区干部集中来区上汇报工作的时间一致。报告后，还要结合讨论，帮助区委布置全区工作。自此以后，遵化县学习报告站的制度就正式形成了。
    一、学习报告站报告的内容、 方法和制度
    遵化县自建站以来，报告内容均以时事政策教育为主，结合当前中心工作。一九五二年在整党时，报告站报告了马林科夫“在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作总结报告”中的关于国际形势部分与有关农村经济和党的工作部分，共报告了三次。在“贯彻婚姻法运动月”中，报告站报告了有关婚姻法的若干问题一次。春耕生产时，报告站报告了中央关于春耕生产的指示。在反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪和整顿农村互助合作的工作中，报告站传达了邓子恢同志报告及有关互助合作和农业生产的文件。这一阶段的学习时间最长，报告的次数也最多。以后报告站又作了朝鲜停战、农业税收、增产节约等报告。到了学习党在国家过渡时期总路线时，听报告的人数更多，县委到各区去报告的次数也增多了。
    每次报告内容由县委决定。县委宣传部教育干事一人，负责搜集各区有关的干部思想问题和工作情况，协助县委起草报告提纲（有时还要理论教员协助）。然后采用集体备课的办法，召开报告员小组会议，确定讲授方法。报告员在报告前先研究报告提纲，到区后结合区委汇报的具体情况进行报告。报告后，由区委搜集听完报告后的意见和问题，反映给报告员，以便改进和解答。报告时，还选择有关的政策文件、人民日报社论和介绍工作经验的文章，作为学习时必读或参考文件。经常的学习时间每天一小时半，每星期以三个早晨进行政治学习，三个早晨学文化。区委书记带头学习，并结合实际研究有关工作中的问题。分片在乡的区委，和工作组的同志一起学习，并帮助附近乡干部的学习。区干部回机关时，区委不但检查他们的工作情况，同时也检查他们的学习情况。此外，还建立了专人辅导、测验及表扬批评等制度。
    二、学习的主要收获
    第一、提高了干部的政治思想水平。学习马林科夫报告中“党”的部分时，纠正了干部的“下山思想”，巩固了“三反”以后的学习成果，广泛地开展了批评和自我批评，加强了干部的团结。如二区区委书记艾民同志说，过去他强调别人的缺点，对自己的缺点很少检讨，因此，区委委员之间不够团结，集体领导也不健全。县委去做报告时，就对他们提出尖锐的批评，再经过学习马林科夫报告，区委委员相互做了深刻的检讨，又召开全区干部会议，普遍地开展批评和自我批评，并号召大家对区委领导提出意见。此后区委就把批评和自我批评定为一项制度，在每次中心工作结束以后，区委委员相互之间都要作一次检查。现在二区的干部团结比以前加强了，干部的工作积极性比以前提高了。一九五二年，互助合作运动有了发展，而干部对农业生产发展的方向不明确，对互助合作政策的理解差，并且没有办社的经验；加上部分整顿生产合作社的干部政策思想混乱，处理社的问题不恰当，引起群众的不满。县委根据这些情况，就决定领导干部学习有关互助合作的各种文件，和组织报告员作互助合作的报告。县委分头亲自到区里去具体地帮助各区整顿旧社和创建新社。就全县学习互助合作政策的情况来看，学习政策的过程，也是做好互助合作工作纠正偏向的过程，又是培养和训练干部的过程。据统计，一九五三年春季前，全县区干部和县级下乡的工作干部四百余人中，能够整顿农业生产合作社的不足二十余人。经过一年以来的互助合作政策的学习，已有百余人能够整顿和组织农业生产合作社了。
    总路线的学习，规模更广，收效更大。全县有三万干部、党员、团员和宣传员学习了总路线。全县除工作会议外，通过报告站即作过六次报告。县报告员还用“带徒弟”的方式，训练了能作报告的干部一百一十人（总路线学习的报告员）。在干部思想认识提高的基础上，全县胜利完成了统购统销任务，并鼓舞了广大农民组织起来发展生产的热情，在一百多个老社的基础上，又发展了三百多个社。
    第二、改进了工作方法。学习站制度，首先对县委深入实际，克服官僚主义起了很大作用。由于县委同志经常到区，就加强了县、区干部之间的联系，减少了不必要的会议。正如十区区委书记赵永兴说：“过去区委书记、区长、武装部长、青年团支部书记、妇联主任每个月都要到县里去开几天会，回区后又要按系统传达，花了许多时间，而在一个月内实际工作的时间就所剩无几了。”建站后，县委到区结合报告布置工作，既节省时间，又可以帮助区里工作，区干部非常满意。过去县里积压群众来信的现象较严重，建站后这些函件都由县委带去处理或就地处理，群众也很满意。在帮助区里掌握政策纠正偏向方面也有不少成绩，如贯彻婚姻法运动月的初期，某区长曾粗暴地拆散早婚男女，适逢县委同志去作报告，问题得以及时发现和纠正。在县委委员分工方面，过去是分区包干制，现在改为统一布置，分工负责，对下乡干部按工作需要进行统一分配，既抓紧了中心工作又照顾了全盘工作。各部门对中心工作的配合也较前有了改进。各经济部门的干部由于能够经常听到县委同志的报告，提高了政治认识，过去存在的重业务轻政治的偏向都有了不同程度的转变。区里的工作方法也有了很大的改进。
    第三、广大干部学习情绪高涨，工作积极性提高。过去有的说“学习钻不进去”，“工作忙学不起来，要学习就要进学校”，现在已没有人这样说了。工作与学习的矛盾已从实际体验中得到解决，大家感到，为了把工作做好，就必须学习。一区区干部反映：“越学越要学”、“三天不学习，会都不知咋开。”十区区委书记赵永兴说：“工作好比切菜，学习好比磨刀。”全区干部一致认为“学习总路线眼睛明亮了”。
      三、几点基本经验
    区干部和下乡干部学习困难的问题，是很久没有解决的问题，遵化县学习报告站成立一年多的事实证明，这个问题是可以得到解决的。
    遵化的经验证明，县委重视是报告站能够坚持和逐渐巩固的主要原因。他们抓紧了三个环节：首先以县委为核心组成报告员小组，县委书记担任组长，督促报告员认真准备报告。如果没有固定的报告员小组和县委的带头，报告站就可能流于形式。其次，全体报告员在做报告之前，县委要召开全体报告员会议，研究报告内容和方法，特别是确定报告的中心题目。他们的备课是认真严肃的。最后，规定报告员纪律，其中有一条是没有特殊事故不准缺课。这样，防止了报告员中途松懈。
    经验证明，报告内容必须密切结合当前工作和干部主要思想，必须理论联系实际。报告员到站作报告是和检查工作结合进行的，并不脱离他们本身业务，所以他们都不感觉到有什么负担。从区干部和下乡干部来看，因为报告是结合工作和干部思想，所以也容易领会和接受。报告的特点是以政策为主，阐述理论，使干部对政策能进一步明确起来；同时也针对干部在执行政策上和认识上的偏差，进行必要的批判，以防止和纠正在工作中发生错误。这样的报告是工作报告，也是学习报告，一般地讲，思想性较强，有战斗力，这是报告受到欢迎的主要原因。
    经验证明，报告站是适合区干部和下乡干部工作特点和他们的政治、文化水平的要求的。由于区干部分散在广大农村进行工作，县的一部分干部也长期下乡搞中心运动，他们的政治、文化水平较低，没有帮助很难进行学习，因此，有些干部对学习感到苦恼，形成思想负担。他们需要有人具体进行帮助和指导，需要在重大时事、政策、理论方面经常给他们讲解。遵化报告站的成立，正满足了他们的需要，解决了他们学习和工作上的困难。
    自然，报告的时间不应机械规定，要服从当前工作需要，也要根据各区的工作安排。另外，宣传部应有人负责报告站的工作，及时搜集情况，整理报告材料。
    四、存在缺点和努力方向
    遵化学习站目前还有一些缺点，如有的报告员做报告时内容讲的多，重点不突出；有的报告员在报告前缺乏充分准备，报告时联系实际也不够；报告后有的讨论不够认真，这些都影响了学习效果。
    今后应进一步加强报告员的学习，以提高报告员的思想、政策水平和报告的质量。在报告内容上，应进一步注意切合工作需要，除在各个时期围绕中心工作进行报告外，尤其要根据工作中发生的带普遍性的严重问题做专题报告。在报告方法上，除个人要对报告作充分准备和加强集体研究外，还应在去站报告前，集中在一个区试行报告，然后再分工去各站报告，这样可以提高报告质量。每次报告后，应认真组织讨论，以巩固学习效果，因之，必须加强区委的辅导工作。
    地委准备在各县逐步建立学习报告站，为了及时总结交流经验，已确定昌黎、迁安、乐亭等县为重点县。地委并要求各县在各区也要逐步建立学习报告站，各县也均要确立一两个重点区，以便取得经验，然后推广。
