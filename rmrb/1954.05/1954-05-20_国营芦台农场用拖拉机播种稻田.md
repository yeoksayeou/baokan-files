    State-Run Lutai Farm Uses Tractors to Sow Rice Paddies
    The rice paddy sowing at the State-Run Lutai Farm has been completed. The newly sown rice seeds are sprouting after the initial irrigation.

    This farm is located in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, about twenty li from Lutai Town. The Jiyun River flows through the southeast, and the entire farm uses river water for irrigation. The farm is crisscrossed by ditches and canals, and the embankments are adorned with weeping willows, poplars, pear trees, and apple trees. At night, the croaking of frogs can be heard from the rice paddies and the shallows. It feels like being in the fields of Jiangnan.

    This is a large-scale mechanized grain farm that grows rice, wheat, soybeans, and various feed crops every year.

    The farm's rice paddies use the advanced Soviet "dry direct sowing method." The rice paddies are first drained, and then tractors are used to drive seeders for sowing. Then, water is irrigated into the fields to allow the seeds to germinate and grow. This year, more than 16,000 mu of rice paddies were sown in only ten days, breaking away from the ancient farming methods of paddy field sowing and transplanting that Chinese farmers have followed for generations.

    During the spring sowing, the No. 4 Stalin 80 tractor driven by Li Yuqi and others drove for 76 days without any accidents. The No. 2 locomotive driven by Guo Tinglian and others sowed 123 mu per hour, exceeding the standard quota by 25 mu. (Shen Shi)

### 国营芦台农场用拖拉机播种稻田

    国营芦台农场用拖拉机播种稻田
    国营芦台农场稻田播种已经完毕，新播的稻种，初次灌水后，正在发出嫩芽。
    这个农场在河北宁河县，离芦台镇约二十里。蓟运河流经东南，全场利用河水灌溉，场内沟渠纵横，堤岸也点缀着垂柳、白杨、梨树和苹果树。晚上，从稻田、从浅水边，传来了蛙声。在这里，好像到了江南的田野。
    这是个规模较大的机械化谷物农场，每年除种植水稻外，还有小麦、大豆和各种饲料作物。
    农场的稻田采用了苏联先进的“旱直播耕种法”，先将稻田落干，用拖拉机带动播种机播种，然后灌水到田中，让种子发芽成长。今年一万六千多亩稻田，只有十天就播种完毕，摆脱了我国农民沿袭的水田播种、插秧古老的耕作法。
    春耕播种中，李玉琦等驾驶的第四号斯大林八十号拖拉机，行车七十六天，没出过事故。郭廷连等驾驶的第二号机车，每小时播种一百二十三亩，超过标准定额二十五亩。　（沈石）
