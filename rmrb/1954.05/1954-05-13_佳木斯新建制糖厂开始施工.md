    New Sugar Refinery in Jiamusi Begins Construction
    Construction of China's first automated and mechanized sugar refinery—the Jiamusi Sugar Refinery, a local state-owned enterprise—began in mid-April and is expected to go into production in the third quarter of next year.

    This sugar refinery was designed with the assistance of the People's Republic of Poland. The factory is enormous in scale, and all of its technical equipment is state-of-the-art. After sugar beets are placed in the flume to be sent to the production workshop, the entire production process, including washing, slicing, and pressing, is controlled by instruments and indicators, with white, green, and red lights indicating production progress to workers. Many of the equipment items are superior to those in China's existing sugar refineries. This sugar refinery will install scientific indicator instruments to observe the quality of sugar crystal formation, maintain the normal concentration of sugar paste, and improve the quality of sugar production. The lime kiln in the factory is also equipped with new mechanical equipment, making the entire production process fully automated.

    Once this sugar refinery is completed, it will require 1,200 tons of sugar beets daily. Farmers in six counties, including Huachuan, Tangyuan, and Jixian, will grow sugar beets with the highest sugar content to supply the sugar refinery. Each year, this sugar refinery will produce 24,000 tons of high-quality cotton sugar, granulated sugar, and industrial alcohol, as well as fusel oil for the manufacture of penicillin and various fragrances, to meet the needs of urban and rural people and national construction.

    佳木斯新建制糖厂开始施工
    我国第一座自动化、机械化制糖厂——地方国营佳木斯制糖厂，已于四月中旬开工兴建，预计明年第三季度投入生产。
    这座糖厂是波兰人民共和国帮助我国设计的。工厂规模巨大，厂内的各种技术设备都是最先进的。把甜菜放在流送沟送到生产车间里后，经过洗菜、切丝、压榨等全部生产过程，都是用仪表和指示仪器控制，用白的、绿的和红的灯指示工人进行生产。有许多设备都比我国原有糖厂更加优越。这座糖厂将安装科学指示仪器，以观察糖质结晶好坏，保持糖糕的浓度正常，提高制糖的质量。厂里的石灰窑也安装新型的机械设备，整个生产过程全是自动化的。
    这座糖厂建成后，每天将需要一千二百吨甜菜，桦川、汤原、集贤等六个县的广大农民，将种植含甜率最多的甜菜供应糖厂。这个糖厂每年将生产出二万四千吨质量优良的棉糖、沙糖和工业生产用的酒精以及制造青霉素、各种香料用的杂醇油，满足城乡人民和国家建设需要。
