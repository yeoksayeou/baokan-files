    I fully endorse the proposals made to this session by Dr. Le Dinh Tham, the representative of Vietnam.

    The Chinese people, like the peace-loving people of Asia and the world, have boundless sympathy and support for the just struggle of the Indochinese people to maintain peace, resist aggression, and strive for independence. We sincerely hope that the ongoing Geneva Conference can reach an agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, so that the Indochinese people can return to a peaceful life.

    As everyone knows, since the French colonialists invaded Indochina in the mid-19th century, the Indochinese people have lost their independence and freedom, and have been forced to live a very miserable life. However, for ninety years, the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have been waging an indomitable struggle for their national independence.

    In September 1940, the French colonialists succumbed to the demands of the Japanese aggressors and declared that they would sell out the Indochinese people to Japanese imperialism "to facilitate the Japanese army's continued operations against China."

    In contrast to the French colonialists' surrender to Japan, the Indochinese people united broadly and launched a heroic struggle against the new aggressors.

    The Indochinese people reclaimed their country from the hands of the Japanese aggressors with their own blood. After Japan surrendered, the Vietnamese people declared independence, established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held general elections, and formed a government. The French government signed an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 6, 1946, recognizing that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "is a free state with its own government, parliament, army and finances." However, the French colonialists were unwilling to give up their colonial rule in Indochina. They tore up the agreement they had signed and launched a large-scale armed attack on the Indochinese people.

    Here, it must be pointed out that in order to seek a peaceful solution to the problem, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam made ten urgent appeals to the French authorities in succession from December 6, 1946 to January 18 of the following year, proposing that both sides cease hostilities, conduct consultations, and restore peace. However, the French authorities did not respond, and subsequently, relying on American military support, they attacked the Indochinese people even more cruelly. This fact proves how consistently and sincerely the Indochinese people have sought to restore peace in Indochina. The French authorities, on the contrary, rejected every peaceful appeal of the Vietnamese people.

    However, a people determined to strive for national independence and democratic freedom cannot be conquered. The Vietnamese people have continuously strengthened their own forces in the struggle against the French colonialists. The people of Cambodia and Laos, who liberated themselves from the Japanese aggressors and declared independence, also launched heroic resistance against the colonialists who invaded their independence and achieved great victories.

    Those who launched the Indochina war once declared that they would "achieve victory within three months," but the war has continued for eight years. Until now, they have not only failed to win the expected victory, but have also fallen into a disastrous situation. In the eight years of colonial war, the French aggressor army has sacrificed more than 300,000 young people and consumed more than 3,000 billion francs. This huge and heavy burden has greatly damaged the lives of the French people and weakened France's international position. Therefore, it is completely understandable that broad sections of the French people and many far-sighted political figures now demand an end to this "dirty war." Especially after the Korean armistice, the French people have realized that since an armistice can be reached through negotiation in Korea, why can't an armistice be reached through negotiation in Indochina?

    However, the pro-war faction of the French authorities refuses to accept the demands of the French people and prefers to obey the command of the American warmongering group that supports the Indochina war. The American warmongering group is afraid of peace. It has long regarded the Indochina war as an integral part of its "global" aggression plan. It tries to use the Indochina war to maintain and create international tension after the Korean armistice. Therefore, it is doing its utmost to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina, and is painstakingly trying to take over and expand the Indochina war. There is no doubt that the policy pursued by the American warmongering group and the French ruling group's pro-war faction's policy of following the United States are the main obstacles to the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    The United States began to interfere in the Indochina war in 1947. While launching the war of aggression against Korea, it occupied China's territory of Taiwan and announced the acceleration of military aid to the French expeditionary force and the Bao Dai puppet troops. According to the announcement of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, from 1950 to December 1953, the military "aid" materials transported by the United States to France for the war in Indochina exceeded 400,000 tons. According to official American and French materials, in 1951, U.S. "aid" accounted for 30 percent of France's total military expenditure in Indochina, 35.1 percent in 1952, 46.9 percent in 1953, and more than 75 percent in 1954. In terms of ammunition consumption, more than 80 percent of the ammunition required in the "Navarre Military Plan" was supplied by the United States. This February, the U.S. President approved the deployment of 500 "U.S. Air Force technicians" to Indochina. 250 of them have already been directly involved in combat, and the so-called unofficial U.S. Air Force personnel recruited by the warmonger Chennault are not included. In addition, former U.S. Pacific Army Commander O'Daniel has been sent to Indochina as the head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Indochina. These facts show that the American warmongering group is doing everything possible to continue and expand the Indochina war and obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    On the eve of the Geneva Conference, the American warmongering group is even more frantically interfering in and expanding the Indochina war. It creates many excuses and falsely accuses the People's Republic of China of "interfering" in the Indochina war to openly call for "united action" and instigate the organization of a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.

    The American warmongering group's attempt to continue and expand the Indochina war has special ambitions. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett said that the strategic and geographical location of the Indochina region, as well as the important raw materials it supplies, are the reasons why the United States must continue to interfere.

    The American warmongering group knows that the continuation of the Indochina war will inevitably weaken France and thus deepen its dependence on the United States. In this way, the United States can further ask France for the right to supervise military aid to Indochina, the right to train local troops, and the right to control the puppet regime, in order to gradually squeeze France out and turn Indochina into an American colony.

    Indeed, as the French pro-war faction increasingly succumbs to the United States, the American warmongering group's imperialist conspiracy to seize the rich resources of Indochina is gradually being realized. American companies such as "Mobil Oil," "Texaco," and "Bethlehem Steel" have launched active plunder in the French-occupied areas. The recently established resource development companies and investment fund companies in Indochina are jointly owned by the United States and France. Many French companies, such as the Banque de l'Indochine, which has played a huge role in the aggression against Indochina for many years, are also closely connected with American capital.

    We can also see that another purpose of the American warmongering group in keeping France mired in the Indochina war is to weaken its position in Europe in order to force it to approve the "European Defense Community" treaty, agree to rearm West Germany, and threaten peace in Europe.

    We can also see that the American warmongering group wants to expand the Indochina war, clamor for "united action" and instigate the organization of a military group in Southeast Asia. Its purpose is not only to seize Indochina, but also to use Indochina as a springboard, and use the vicious policy of "Asians fighting Asians" to squeeze out other old colonial countries in order to establish its new colonial rule in Asia. But there is no reason to believe that the people of Asian countries, united in striving for national liberation and treasuring their freedom and peace, will willingly act as tools of the American aggressors. The American policy of carrying out military adventures in Asia and organizing a "Southeast Asian military alliance" has universally aroused the anger and opposition of Southeast Asian countries. Public opinion in India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon and other countries has unanimously pointed out that this is a blatant and intolerable new interference by the United States in Asian affairs.

    Opposing the American expansion of the war and restoring peace in Indochina is now not only the common demand of the Indochinese people and the people of Asian countries, but also the common demand of the French people and all peace-loving people in the world.

    The proposals made by Mr. Pham Van Dong, Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and the important goals of these proposals, reflect the peaceful aspirations of the Indochinese people and conform to the will and interests of the French people. Therefore, it is fair, reasonable, practical and feasible, and can pave the way for the restoration of peace in Indochina. We believe that all peace-loving people in the world will give it their heartfelt support and demand that it be used as the basis for consultation to reach an agreement. At the same time, in order to enable the people of Cambodia and Laos to have ample opportunities to express their will and achieve the goal of restoring peace throughout Indochina, we believe that the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos should have representatives attending the Geneva Conference.

    We believe that there is no reason why the Geneva Conference cannot reach an agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. If there is one, it is mainly due to the obstruction and sabotage of the American warmongering group, which is trying its best to expand the Indochina war, and the pro-war faction in the French ruling group that follows it. I propose that this Council meeting should call on the people of the world to oppose the conspiracy of the American warmongering group to sabotage the Geneva Conference; and demand that the French delegation attending the Geneva Conference should sincerely seek a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue based on the principle of conducting negotiations on the basis of equal rights. We would also like to especially appeal to the peace-loving French people and far-sighted people who care about the national interests of France: Now is the time for French public opinion and the French people to rise up to stop a small number of pro-war factions from blindly following the United States at the expense of the national interests of France. These small number of pro-war factions, on the one hand, ignore the current situation and still adhere to their outdated colonialist ideas, pretending to be "conquerors" and "victors," refusing to recognize the national rights of the Indochinese people; on the other hand, they sacrifice the glorious tradition of the French people striving for independence, and succumb to the American warmongering group's policy of expanding the war, not hesitating to sell out the national interests of France.

    We Chinese people have always had a long-standing and deep friendship with the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This friendship is based on mutual respect for each other's independence. The deep friendship between the Chinese people and the Indochinese people cannot be destroyed by any force. Naturally, the Chinese people cannot but be particularly concerned about the restoration of peace in Indochina, which is adjacent to our southern border. We are closely watching the development of the Indochina situation and will never tolerate anyone trying to expand the war there to threaten our security. Anyone who can learn from historical lessons should realize this. If American imperialism and its followers think that our peace efforts are a sign of weakness, they are completely wrong.

    Here I would also like to solemnly warn the American warmongering group: Occupying our Taiwan under the pretext of assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and preparing to include the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the "Southeast Asian military alliance" is absolutely intolerable to us Chinese people. Yesterday, the Polish representative's speech at the meeting mentioned the interception and detention of Polish merchant ships heading to China by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We believe that this is completely an act of piracy supported by American forces. This is also a concrete fact that the American warmongering group is deliberately threatening and undermining peace and security in Asia. We hope that the world's just public opinion will unanimously condemn it.

    We Chinese people are peace-loving. We are now vigorously engaged in socialist peaceful construction. Therefore, like the peace-loving people of the world, we sincerely hope, in order to maintain peace and security in Asia and the world, that the war in Indochina will end as soon as possible, and that the peaceful life of the Indochinese people can be restored as soon as possible. We are willing to work together with all friends who share the same hope to achieve this goal. (Xinhua News Agency, Berlin)

### 为恢复印度支那的和平而努力——马寅初在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议二十七日会议上的发言

    为恢复印度支那的和平而努力
    ——马寅初在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议二十七日会议上的发言
    我完全赞成越南代表黎廷探博士向本届会议提出的建议。
    我们中国人民和亚洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民一样，对于印度支那人民维护和平、抵抗侵略、争取独立的正义斗争是寄以无限的同情和支持的。我们深切地希望正在举行的日内瓦会议能对恢复印度支那和平的问题达成协议，使印度支那人民能重过和平生活。
    如大家所知，自从十九世纪中叶法国殖民者侵入印度支那之后，印度支那人民即失去了独立和自由，被迫过着极悲惨的生活，但是九十年来越南、高棉、寮国的人民始终为他们的民族独立而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    一九四零年九月法国殖民者屈服于日本侵略者的要求，并声言“为便于日本军队继续对中国作战”将印度支那人民出卖给日本帝国主义。
    与法国殖民者对于日本的屈膝投降相反，印度支那人民则广泛地团结起来，为反对新的侵略者而展开英勇的斗争。
    印度支那人民是用自己的鲜血从日本侵略者的手中夺回了他们的国家的。日本投降后，越南人民宣告独立，成立越南民主共和国，举行普选，组织政府。法国政府曾于一九四六年三月六日与越南民主共和国签订协定，承认越南民主共和国“是一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政”。但是，法国殖民者不甘心放弃在印度支那的殖民统治，他们撕毁了自己签订的协定，对印度支那人民发动了大规模的武装进攻。
    在这里，必须指出印度支那人民为了求得问题的和平解决，从一九四六年十二月六日起到次年一月十八日止的四十三天中，越南民主共和国胡志明主席就曾向法国当局接连发出十次的紧急呼吁，提议双方停止敌对行动，进行协商，恢复和平。可是，法国当局没有答复，其后并依仗着有美国的军事支援，更残酷地向印度支那人民进攻。这一事实证明：印度支那人民是如何一贯诚意谋求恢复印度支那的和平。而法国当局恰恰相反，他们拒绝了越南人民每一次的和平呼吁。
    然而，决心争取民族独立和民主自由的人民是无法征服的。越南人民在抵抗法国殖民者的斗争中不断壮大了自己的力量。从日本侵略者手中解放了自己并宣告独立的高棉和寮国人民，也对侵略他们独立的殖民者进行英勇的抵抗并取得了巨大的胜利。
    发动印度支那战争的人虽然曾扬言“三个月内取得胜利”，可是战争一直继续了八年，直到现在他们不仅没有赢得预期的胜利，而且已陷入了惨败的境地。在八年的殖民战争中，法国侵略军已牺牲了三十多万青年，消耗了三万亿以上法郎，这种巨额的沉重负担，大大损害了法国的人民生活和削弱了法国的国际地位。因此，法国广大阶层的人民和许多有远见的政治人物，现在都要求结束这个“肮脏战争”，这是完全可以理解的。尤其是在朝鲜停战之后，法国的人民更认识到既然在朝鲜可以通过协商方式来达成停战，在印度支那为什么不可以同样通过协商达成停战呢？
    但是，法国当权者的主战派，不肯接受法国人民的要求，宁肯服从支持印度支那战争的美国好战集团的指挥。美国好战集团是害怕和平的，它早已把印度支那战争作为它的“全球”侵略计划的一个组成部分，它力图在朝鲜停战后利用印度支那战争来保持和制造国际的紧张局势，因而竭力阻挠印度支那和平的恢复，并处心积虑地要接管和扩大印度支那战争。毫无疑问，美国好战集团所奉行的这一政策以及法国统治集团中主战派的追随美国这一政策，是恢复印度支那和平的主要障碍。
    美国在一九四七年就开始干涉印度支那战争，它在发动侵朝战争的同时，一方面侵占中国的领土台湾；一方面即宣布加速以军事援助供给法国远征军和保大傀儡部队。据美国驻西贡大使馆宣布，从一九五○年到一九五三年十二月止，美国运给法国在印度支那进行战争的军事“援助”物资已超过四十万吨。根据美、法官方的材料计算，在一九五一年，美“援”占法国印度支那军费总支出的百分之三十，一九五二年占百分之三十五点一，一九五三年占百分之四十六点九，一九五四年则占百分之七十五以上。在军火消耗方面，“纳瓦尔军事计划”中规定所需的军火百分之八十以上是由美国供应的。今年二月，美国总统又批准五百名“美国空军技术人员”赴印度支那。其中有二百五十名已经直接投入战斗，而由好战分子陈纳德出名招募的所谓非官方的美国空军人员尚未计算在内。此外，前美国太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔已被派往印度支那担任美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团团长，这些事实说明：美国好战集团是用尽一切办法来继续和扩大印度支那战争，阻挠印度支那和平的恢复。
    在日内瓦会议前夕，美国好战集团更其疯狂地进行干涉和扩大印度支那战争的活动。它制造许多借口，并诬蔑中华人民共和国“干涉”印度支那战争以公开号召采取“联合行动”，策动组织东南亚和西太平洋的军事联盟。
    美国好战集团企图继续和扩大印度支那战争是有着特别的野心的。前美国国防部长罗维特就说过，印度支那这个地区的战略和地理位置，以及它所供应的重要原料是美国必须继续干涉的原因。
    美国好战集团知道印度支那战争的继续，势必使法国日趋衰弱，从而日益加深它对美国的依赖，这样，美国便可以进一步向法国提出对印度支那军事援助的监督权，对地方军队的训练权和对傀儡政权的控制权，以便达到逐步将法国排挤出去，变印度支那为美国的殖民地的目的。
    的确，随着法国主战派的日益屈服于美国，美国好战集团要攫取印度支那的丰富资源的帝国主义阴谋，已在逐步实现。美国的“美孚油公司”“德士古石油公司”“伯利恒钢铁公司”等都已在法国占领区展开了积极的掠夺活动，最近成立的在印度支那的资源开发公司和投资基金公司是美法合股的。许多法国公司：如多年来对印度支那的侵略起了极大作用的法资东方汇理银行，也与美国资本紧密地连接在一起了。
    我们还可以看到美国好战集团要法国继续陷入印度支那战争的另一目的，是要削弱它在欧洲的地位，以便压迫它批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，同意重新武装西德，威胁欧洲的和平。
    我们也可以看到美国好战集团要扩大印度支那战争，叫嚣采取“联合行动”和策动组织东南亚的军事集团，其目的尚不仅在于攫取印度支那；而且还想以印度支那为跳板，以“亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒政策排挤其他旧的殖民国家，以建立它在亚洲的新殖民统治。但是没有任何理由可以相信团结在争取民族解放和珍贵自己的自由与和平的亚洲各国人民，会甘心充当美国侵略者的工具的。美国在亚洲进行军事冒险和组织“东南亚军事联盟”的政策，已经普遍引起东南亚各国的愤怒和反对。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦、锡兰等国的公众舆论都一致指出，这是美国明目张胆地对亚洲事务的不能容忍的新的干涉。
    反对美国扩大战争、恢复印度支那的和平，现在已不仅是印度支那人民和亚洲各国人民的共同要求，而且也是法国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的共同要求了。
    越南民主共和国代理外长范文同先生在日内瓦会议上所提出的关于恢复印度支那和平的建议和这些建议的重要目的，既反映了印度支那人民的和平愿望，也符合于法国人民的意志和利益。因此是公平合理的、实际可行的，能够为恢复印度支那和平开辟道路的。我们相信全世界所有爱好和平的人民都会予以衷心的支持，并要求以此作为协商以达成协议的基础。同时，为了能使高棉、寮国的人民有充分的机会表达他们的意志和达到在印度支那全境恢复和平的目的，我们认为高棉和寮国人民的抗战政府应该有代表出席日内瓦会议。
    我们相信：没有任何理由使日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平的问题上不能达成协议。如果有的话，那就是主要由于竭力企图扩大印度支那战争的美国好战集团和追随它的法国统治集团中主战派的阻挠和破坏。我建议本届理事会会议应号召世界人民反对美国好战集团破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋；并要求法国出席日内瓦会议的代表团应该根据平等权利进行协议的原则，诚心诚意地谋求印度支那问题的和平解决。我们还想特别向爱好和平的法国人民和具有远见的关心法国民族利益的人士呼吁：现在是法国舆论和法国人民起来制止少数主战派不顾法国民族利益而死心追随美国走的时候了。这些少数的主战派，一方面无视目前的实际情况，仍然坚持他们过时的殖民主义观念，俨然以“征服者”“胜利者”自居，拒绝承认印度支那人民的民族权利；另一方面他们则牺牲了争取独立的法国人民的光荣传统，屈从于美国好战集团扩大战争的政策，不惜出卖法国的民族利益。
    我们中国人民与越南、高棉、寮国人民之间一向存在着历史悠久的深厚友谊，这种友谊是建立在互相尊重各自的独立的基础上的。中国人民与印度支那人民的深厚友谊是没有任何的力量能够破坏的。很自然的，中国人民对于与其南部边界毗邻的印度支那的和平的恢复不能不特别关切，我们密切注视印度支那局势的发展，并决不能容忍任何人在那里企图扩大战争以威胁我们的安全。凡是能够接受历史教训的人，都应该认识到这一点。如果美国帝国主义及其追随者以为我们的和平努力乃是示弱，那就大错而特错了。
    在这里我还要郑重地警告美国好战集团：以援助蒋介石匪帮为借口侵占着我们的台湾，并准备把蒋介石匪帮也加入“东南亚军事联盟”，这是我们中国人民绝对不能容忍的。昨天，波兰代表在大会上的发言提到波兰开往中国的商船被蒋介石匪帮拦击扣留一事，我们认为这完全是在美国势力支持下的海盗行为。这也就是美国好战集团存心威胁并破坏亚洲的和平与安全的一个具体的事实。我们希望世界的公正舆论一致加以谴责。
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的，我们现在正大力从事社会主义的和平建设，因此，我们也和世界各国爱好和平的人民一样，为了维护亚洲及世界的和平与安全，极其希望：印度支那的战争早日停止，印度支那人民的和平生活能早日恢复。我们愿意和所有抱有同样希望的朋友们在一起，为实现这个目的而共同努力。　（新华社柏林讯）
