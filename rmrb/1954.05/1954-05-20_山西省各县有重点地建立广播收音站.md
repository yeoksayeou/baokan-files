In order to expand the rural broadcast radio network and make radio propaganda better serve the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to establish 1,400 broadcast radio stations in key agricultural production cooperatives in the province's base-point townships. The tasks of the radio stations are: to organize members of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the village, as well as individual farmers, to listen to the Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station's farmers' programs and the Central People's Broadcasting Station's joint broadcast programs and other programs; to regularly organize Party members, Party propagandists, and Communist Youth League members to listen, and to require them to conduct propaganda to the masses anytime, anywhere, so that the radio stations truly become powerful tools for the Party in rural areas to conduct political and ideological education for the masses, exchange work experience, and invigorate rural cultural life. At present, various counties are actively carrying out the work of establishing rural broadcast radio stations. (Lu Sheng)

    山西省各县有重点地建立广播收音站
    为了扩大农村广播收音网，使广播宣传更好地为农业的社会主义改造服务，中共山西省委宣传部确定在全省各县基点乡的重点农业生产合作社中建立一千四百个广播收音站。收音站的任务是：组织农业生产合作社社员和本村的互助组组员与单干农民收听省人民广播电台的农民节目和中央人民广播电台的联播节目及其它节目；经常组织党员和党的宣传员及青年团员收听，并要求他们能随时随地向群众进行宣传，使收音站确实成为农村党对群众进行政治思想教育、交流工作经验和活跃农村文化生活的有力工具。目前，各县正在积极进行建立农村广播收音站的工作。　（鲁生）
