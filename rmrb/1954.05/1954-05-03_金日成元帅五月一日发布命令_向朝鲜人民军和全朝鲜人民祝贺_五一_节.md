The Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, Marshal Kim Il-sung, issued an order on May 1st, extending May Day greetings to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and all the Korean people.

The order stated: Today, we are engaged in the solemn struggle for the peaceful reunification and independence of our fatherland and for the strengthening of the democratic base of the Republic through the post-war restoration and development of the people's economy. We are welcoming the first International Labor Day of the world's working people—May Day—after the victorious conclusion of the great Fatherland Liberation War.

Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, the Korean people, with high political enthusiasm and selfless labor, are united and striving to rebuild their country. The people of the People's Republic of China and the people of other People's Democratic countries, headed by the great Soviet people, continue to provide the Korean people with enormous material and technical assistance, helping us in our struggle for post-war reconstruction.

The order pointed out: Today, the world's democratic and socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is growing and strengthening day by day; conversely, the imperialist reactionary forces, headed by U.S. imperialism, are further weakening. The imperialist aggressors, fearing the internationalist friendship and unity of the world's working people, are frantically plotting to provoke a new world war in Asia and Europe.

U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique have not abandoned their aggressive intentions towards our country. They are obstructing and hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and are creating a series of provocative actions. Under such circumstances, we must further strengthen our country's defense capabilities and defend the achievements of the people's peaceful labor like a wall of bronze. The order stated: On this May Day, I order:

(1) All members of the People's Army must be armed with high patriotism and proletarian internationalism, constantly strengthen the friendship with the officers and soldiers of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, sharply monitor the enemy's every move with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, constantly be prepared for combat, master their weapons, cherish combat equipment, strictly implement the requirements of military regulations and manuals, and effectively carry out combat and political training.

(2) All officers and generals must continuously study military and political knowledge, improve their ability to educate and train their subordinates, require their subordinates to strictly observe order and military discipline at all times, and make every effort to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the People's Army units.

(3) All members of the People's Army must always strengthen their flesh-and-blood ties with the people with the spirit of cherishing and respecting the people, and assist the people in their struggle for restoration and construction with all sincerity and energy. (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang)

    金日成元帅五月一日发布命令
    向朝鲜人民军和全朝鲜人民祝贺“五一”节
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在五月一日发布命令，向朝鲜人民军全体将士和全朝鲜人民祝贺“五一”国际劳动节。
    命令说：今天，我们在为祖国的和平统一、独立和为加强共和国民主基地而进行战后人民经济恢复发展的庄严斗争里，迎接胜利结束伟大的祖国解放战争后的第一个全世界劳动人民的国际节日——“五一”节。
    朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，正以高度的政治热情和忘我的劳动，一致奋起，进行着重建祖国的事业。以伟大的苏联人民为首，中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民继续给予朝鲜人民以莫大的物资和技术援助，帮助我们进行战后重建的斗争。
    命令指出：今天，以苏联为首的世界民主与社会主义阵营正在日益成长和加强；相反的，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义反动势力正在进一步削弱。帝国主义侵略者害怕世界劳动人民的国际主义友谊团结，正疯狂地策划在亚洲和欧洲挑拨新的世界战争。
    美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮并没有放弃对我们祖国的侵略企图，他们在妨害和阻挠着朝鲜问题的和平解决，并制造着一连串的挑衅行动。在这样的形势下，我们必须进一步加强我们祖国的国防力量，铜墙铁壁般地保卫人民的和平劳动的成果。命令说：值此“五一”节，我命令：
      （一）人民军全体军人要以高度的爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义思想武装起来，不断地加强和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军将士们的友谊，以高度的革命警惕性锐利地监视敌人的一举一动，经常做好战斗准备，精通自己的武器，爱护战斗器材，严格执行军事规定和教范的要求，有效地进行战斗政治训练。
      （二）全体军官和将领们要不断地学习军事政治知识，提高对部下进行教育、培养工作的能力，要求部下时刻严守秩序和军事纪律，全力加强人民军部队的战斗力。
      （三）人民军全体军人们要经常以爱护和尊敬人民的精神，加强和他们的血肉联系，尽一切诚意和精力，协助人民进行恢复建设斗争。（新华社平壤讯）
