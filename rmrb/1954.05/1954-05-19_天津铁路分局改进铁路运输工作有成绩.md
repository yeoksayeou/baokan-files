    Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau Achieves Progress in Improving Railway Transportation Work
    Last year, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau frequently failed to complete its transportation tasks, and serious vehicle congestion occurred at the Tianjin Station. After Vice Minister of Railways Wu Jingtian inspected the work of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau at the end of last year, in the first quarter of this year, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways and the suggestions of Soviet experts, strengthened specific leadership over transportation organization work. In January and February of this year, due to insufficient cargo supply, the loading plan could not be completed. The Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau actively mobilized employees, organized cargo sources, and improved the operating methods of cargo yards to load more goods, thus completing the loading plan in March. In April, it even overfulfilled the loading plan by 114.3 percent.
    In February, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau formed a working group and went deep into Tianjin, Nancang, and other stations to inspect the execution of the plan, and discovered the shortcomings of Tianjin Station in failing to earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. The operation plan of Tianjin Station was inaccurate, and the shift plan and three-hour plan could not be fulfilled. No trains were dispatched during the period from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day, which affected the balanced completion of the plan. Many vehicles could not be turned around in time. The number of vehicles staying in the station for more than 24 hours reached as many as 90. Some vehicles had been parked for more than 20 days and had not yet been dispatched. Based on this situation, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau specifically helped Tianjin Station implement the operation plan, grasp the situation of vehicles staying in the station, and promptly detach and attach and dispatch trains, shorten the vehicle stay time and transfer time, and change the past situation of vehicle congestion. In addition, the work of small stations was strengthened, requiring small stations to promote the advanced Soviet experience—the no-detachment operation method—which also shortened the vehicle stay time. In April, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau shortened the vehicle stay time by 1.5 hours, completing the plan by 113.8 percent, and shortened the transfer time by 0.4 hours. The speed of vehicle turnover was improved. In April, 110.5 percent of the turnover rate plan was completed.
    The Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau also strengthened dispatch work and established a transportation analysis system for ten-day periods, months, and seasons. Based on the analysis, the shortcoming of slow locomotive turnover was discovered. The locomotive's daily mileage plan could not be completed. In March, the connection between locomotive dispatchers and train dispatchers was strengthened to improve the efficiency of locomotive turnover. In April, 103.2 percent of the locomotive's daily car-kilometer plan was completed.
    Because the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau has made achievements in improving transportation work, it received the Red Flag award from the Tianjin Railway Administration in March. (Chen Ji)

    天津铁路分局改进铁路运输工作有成绩
    去年天津铁路分局经常完不成运输任务，天津车站曾经发生车辆堵塞的严重现象。去年年底铁道部武竞天副部长检查天津铁路分局的工作后，今年第一季度，天津铁路分局根据铁道部的指示和苏联专家的建议，加强对于运输组织工作的具体领导。今年一、二月份，由于货源的不足，不能完成装车计划。天津铁路分局积极地发动职工，组织货源，改进货厂的作业方法，多装货物，因而在三月份完成装车计划。四月份，还超额完成装车计划百分之一百一十四点三。
    天津铁路分局在二月份组成工作组，深入天津、南仓等车站，检查计划执行的情况，发现天津车站未认真贯彻苏联专家建议的缺点。天津车站的作业计划不准确，班计划和三小时计划不能兑现。在每天下午六点钟至九点钟的时间内，不发出列车，影响计划均衡的完成。许多车辆不能及时周转。在站内停留二十四小时以上的车辆，达到九十辆之多。有些车辆，停了二十多天，还没开出去。天津铁路分局根据这种情况，具体地帮助天津车站贯彻作业计划，掌握站内车辆停留的情况，及时地甩挂和接发列车，缩短车辆停留时间和中转时间，改变了过去车辆堵塞的情况。此外，还加强了小车站的工作，要求小车站推行苏联先进经验——不摘车作业法，也缩短了车辆停留时间。四月份，天津铁路分局缩短车辆停留时间一点五小时，完成计划百分之一百一十三点八。缩短中转时间零点四小时。车辆周转的速度得到提高。四月份，完成周转率计划的百分之一百一十点五。
    天津铁路分局还加强了调度工作，建立旬、月、季的运输分析制度。根据分析，曾经发现机车周转太慢的缺点。机车每天走行公里的计划，不能完成。三月份，加强机车调度员和行车调度员的联系，提高机车周转的效率。四月份完成机车日车公里的计划百分之一百零三点二。
    天津铁路分局因为改进运输工作有成绩，得到了天津铁路管理局三月份的红旗奖励。（陈迹）
