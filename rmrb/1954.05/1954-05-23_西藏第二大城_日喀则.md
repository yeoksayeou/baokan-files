A town located on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, named after a village (Rikaze) on high ground (Ze). After centuries of hard work by the Tibetan people, it has gradually become the economic and cultural center of western Tibet today. Entering the Shigatse river valley plain along the Nyang Chu River, one can see the Tashilhunpo Monastery with its nine golden roofs and ten thousand rooms; a white stone castle, one hundred meters high, stands tall to the north of the crisscrossing houses of the city. These ancient and magnificent buildings demonstrate the diligence, wisdom, and great creative power of the Tibetan working people. Standing on a building in the urban area of Shigatse, the reporter can clearly see that this border city of the motherland, with a population of nearly 20,000, is closely connected with the vast pastures and vast fertile agricultural areas of western Tibet. Behind the snow-capped mountains to its north is the boundless natural pastureland of Qiangtang, where large quantities of wool, yak butter, lake salt, and valuable animal skins are collected and distributed in Shigatse every year. Tibet's largest river, the Yarlung Tsangpo, is navigated year-round by large fleets of yak-hide boats, transporting grain and local specialties from southern Xinjiang, Ali, and the upper reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River to Shigatse for sale. To the east and west of Shigatse are fertile fields stretching over six hundred li, producing crops such as wheat, highland barley, rapeseed, and buckwheat, and are known as one of Tibet's main granaries. Shigatse is also a famous handicraft city in Tibet, with a total of six hundred and fifty households engaged in twenty-four kinds of handicrafts, producing large quantities of wooden bowls, Tibetan boots, pulu, carpets, and horse gear, which are supplied to farmers and herdsmen. During the period of imperialist aggression in Tibet, Shigatse, like other towns, gradually declined. By the time of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, seventy carpet weaving businesses alone had gone bankrupt in the city. The situation has now greatly changed. With the support of loans from the People's Bank of China, the total output value of only one hundred and ninety handicraft households last year increased by more than 990 million yuan compared to the previous year. Anyone who has been to Shigatse cannot help but be excited by the new atmosphere of this border city. The People's Bank, state-owned trading companies, and telecommunications bureaus, which serve the Tibetan people, have been established, and citizens and merchants can smoothly handle loan applications, order goods, and send telegrams. In the open-air market in the center of the street, white tents are set up in a row, and farmers and herdsmen are everywhere selecting goods. The newly furnished stalls have increased by more than two hundred and fifty compared to before liberation. In addition to the conspicuous colorful silk belts, cushions, and furs of lynx and otters, there are also goods from the interior, including tea, brown sugar, silk, and porcelain from Jiangxi. Shigatse has become increasingly prosperous day by day since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. A person familiar with the market situation told reporters: This is because in addition to the support given to industry and commerce by the People's Bank and the trade departments, the corvée labor of the Tibetan people has been reduced after liberation, the wool in pastoral areas has a market, and farmers receive agricultural loans every year, and these last two years have seen bumper harvests. The purchasing power of the vast number of farmers and herdsmen has begun to increase, which has brought prosperity to Shigatse.

This border city has also undergone new changes in cultural and health undertakings. A new type of people's hospital is under construction. The city's first primary school has been established for a full year. Members of the Shigatse Patriotic Youth Cultural Association have become active members of the city's cultural life. Tibetan youths study and dance together, and sometimes hold garden parties. The newly built club in the city and the square in front of the auditorium are entertainment venues for citizens and People's Liberation Army soldiers to hold get-togethers and conduct friendly sports competitions. Now, citizens often watch movies with the People's Liberation Army. When they see the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, on the screen, they enthusiastically cheer and applaud, thanking him for bringing a happy life to the Tibetan people.

    西藏第二大城——日喀则
    新华社记者  赵奇
    一座位于雅鲁藏布江上游南岸的城镇，以高地（则）的村落（日喀）得名。经过藏族人民几百年的辛勤努力，它已经逐渐成为今天西藏西部的经济和文化中心。沿年楚河进入日喀则河谷平原，便可以望见有九座金顶的札什伦布寺和寺院的万间楼房；高达一百公尺的白色石头城堡，耸立在房屋交错的市区北面。这些古老壮丽的建筑物，显示着西藏劳动人民的勤劳、智慧和伟大的创造力量。记者站在日喀则市区的楼房上展望，可以清楚地知道这座拥有近两万人口的祖国边疆城市，密切地联系着西藏西部辽阔的牧场和广大肥沃的农区。在它北面的雪山背后，是无际的天然牧场——羌塘，每年有大量的羊毛、酥油、湖盐和贵重兽皮等产品在日喀则集散。西藏最大的河流——雅鲁藏布江成年航行着大队的牛皮船，把南疆、阿里和雅鲁藏布江上游沿岸的粮食和土产特产品运到日喀则来销售。在日喀则的东西两面，是连成六百多里的一片肥田沃野，出产小麦、青稞、油菜、荞麦等作物，被称为西藏的主要粮仓之一。日喀则也是西藏有名的手工业城市，全市二十四种手工业共六百五十多户，出产大批的木碗、藏靴、氆氇、毯垫和马具等，供应农牧民。在帝国主义势力侵入西藏时期，日喀则像其他城镇一样逐渐萧条，到西藏和平解放时，全市仅织毯业倒闭的就有七十家。现在情况大大地改变了，在中国人民银行的贷款扶持下，仅一百九十家手工业户去年的生产总值就比前年增加了九亿九千多万元。来过日喀则的人，都不能不为这座边疆古城的新气象感到兴奋。为藏族人民服务的人民银行、国营贸易公司、电信局都已成立，市民和商人们能够顺利地办理贷款、订货和拍发电报的手续了。在大街中央的露天市场上，白色帐篷搭成一片，到处是挑选货物的农牧民，新陈设的货摊比解放前增加了两百五十多个，地摊上除了摆着显目的各色绸腰带、花垫和猞猁、水獭等兽皮外，还有来自内地的货物，其中有茶叶、红糖、绸缎和江西的瓷器。日喀则在西藏和平解放以后一天天地繁荣起来了，一个熟悉市场情况的人告诉记者说：这是因为除了工商业得到人民银行和贸易部门的扶助以外，解放后西藏人民的差役减轻了，牧区的羊毛有了销路，农民每年得到农业贷款，这两年又获得了丰收。广大农牧民购买力开始提高，就给日喀则带来了繁荣。
    这座边疆城市在文化卫生事业方面，也有了新的变化。一个新型的人民医院正在加紧修建中。市内第一所小学已成立了整整一年。日喀则市爱国青年文化联谊会的会员们，已成为市内文化生活中的活跃分子，藏族青年们在一块学习和歌舞，有时还举行游园会。市内新建的俱乐部和大礼堂前的广场，是市民和人民解放军战士们举行联欢会和进行球类友谊赛的娱乐场所。现在，市民们经常和人民解放军在一起看电影，他们在银幕上看到各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的时候，都热烈地欢呼鼓掌，感谢他给西藏人民带来了幸福的生活。
