Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 20th -- More and more outstanding farmers in rural Guangxi Province are joining the Communist Party of China. In 1953, the number of Communist Party members among farmers of all ethnic groups in the province increased by more than 40% compared to 1952; before April this year, more than 13,800 advanced elements were admitted into the Communist Party of China. Among these Communist Party members, the Zhuang, Yao, Dong, and Miao minorities account for about 25%.

In rural Guangxi Province, when a village has a Communist Party member, the peasant masses consider it an honor for all the people in the village; when a township has a Communist Party branch, the mutual aid and cooperation and the production increase movement in that township is carried out particularly well. Many peasants say: whoever wants to join a mutual aid team or an agricultural production cooperative, whoever wants to produce more grain, should go to the Communist Party members, they are the "leaders of socialism." At present, there are 484 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, of which 200 cooperatives have 455 male and female Communist Party members elected by the peasants as chairmen, vice-chairmen, and production team leaders. Many mutual aid team leaders are also Communist Party members. They are taking agricultural production cooperatives as the core, connecting nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers, forming many mutual aid and cooperation networks, and promoting the production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas. The agricultural production cooperative led by Jiang Zaiqiu, a famous labor model in the province, led several villages to overcome the summer drought disaster that had not been seen for decades last year. This spring, it expanded from 14 households to 206 households, becoming the first large cooperative in the province. Among these Communist Party members, there is also Tang Lianxing, a provincial model township cadre and secretary of the CPC Lianghe Township Branch in the county. He is an excellent person who wholeheartedly serves the people. In any work, he has never said the word "difficult" even once. Thanks to his collective leadership with other branch committee members, of the 355 peasant households in Lianghe Township, all but 11 have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. At the Second Guangxi Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference held this spring, more than 80 Party members were selected as provincial labor models.

The CPC organizations at all levels in Guangxi Province attach great importance to the work of developing new Party members in rural areas. In recent years, various places have adopted the form of training classes to conduct communist and Communist Party education for tens of thousands of rural activists. At present, Party committees at all levels have gradually strengthened the ideological leadership of new Party members and are preparing to continue to strengthen the Party's ranks on a consolidated basis.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing -- As of April this year, 201 engineers and technicians in Chongqing factories have joined the Communist Party. Among them, 23 are engineers, and there are also some technicians and skilled workers. These people have been educated and cultivated by the Communist Party over the years, and their political awareness has been continuously improved, and they have the qualifications to be a Communist Party member. Engineer Zou Chengzhu of the 101 Steel Plant, with the help of the Party, closely integrated his technical theory with the labor experience of workers, and humbly studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. He successfully designed and trial-rolled new products such as 43 kg heavy rails and 8 kg light rails. Now he has been approved as a Communist Party member. Li Xianyin, technical director of the steelmaking workshop of the 102 Steel Plant, deeply felt from many personal experiences that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can technology be improved, wisdom be brought into play, and knowledge be fully utilized. He submitted a request to join the Party and was awarded the glorious title of Communist Party member at the end of 1953.

Many newly admitted engineers and technicians, under the continued education of the Party, are playing a more active role as models. Engineer He Yuanhai led the group to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and took the lead in successfully experimenting with the "high-speed cutting method" in the factory. In the trial production of new products, he also created the "rapid drawing recognition method," enabling 75% of the drawing illiterate and semi-drawing illiterate people in the entire workshop to understand simple charts in six hours, shortening the trial production time of new products. His technical team has successively won 15 awards. Du Lijun, director of the workshop of Chongqing 610 Automatic Loom Factory, relied on the leadership of the Party, united technicians and veteran workers, and organized a technical research group, so that the unit output of each loom increased from two yards to four and a half yards, and the rate of substandard cloth decreased from 70% and 80% to below 5%. At the recent city-wide industrial labor model representative conference, he was also named a Class B industrial labor model in the city.

    广西省各族优秀农民加入共产党
    重庆一批技术人员获得共产党员光荣称号
    【新华社南宁二十日电】广西省农村中参加中国共产党的优秀农民越来越多。一九五三年全省各族农民中的共产党员比一九五二年增加百分之四十以上；今年四月前，又有一万三千八百多个先进分子被吸收加入中国共产党。这些共产党员中，僮、瑶、侗、苗等少数民族共占百分之二十五左右。
    在广西省农村中，那一个村里有了共产党员，农民群众就认为是全村人民的光荣；那一个乡里有了共产党支部，那个乡里的互助合作和增产运动就开展得特别出色。许多农民说：谁要参加互助组、农业生产合作社，谁要多打粮食，就去找共产党员，他们是“社会主义的带路人”。目前全省共有四百八十四个农业生产合作社，其中二百个社就有四百五十五名男女共产党员被农民推选为正、副社长和生产队队长。许多互助组的组长也都是共产党员。他们正以农业生产合作社为核心，联系附近互助组和单干农民，组成很多互助合作网，推动着农村里以互助合作为中心的增产运动。全省著名劳动模范蒋在球所领导的农业生产合作社，去年带动几个村战胜了数十年没有过的夏旱灾害，今春就由十四户扩大到二百零六户，成为全省第一个大社。这些共产党员中，还有全省模范乡干部、中共全县两合乡支部书记唐连星，他是一个忠心耿耿为人民服务的优秀人物。在任何工作中他从没有说过一次“难”字。由于他和其他支部委员的集体领导，两合乡三百五十五户农民中，除十一户外都参加了互助合作组织。今年春季举行的广西省第二届农业劳动模范代表会议中，有八十多个党员被评选为省劳动模范。
    中共广西省各级组织十分重视在农村中发展新党员的工作。几年来，各地都采取训练班的形式，向数万名农村积极分子进行了共产主义和共产党的教育。目前，各级党委对新党员的思想领导已逐步加强，准备在巩固的基础上继续壮大党的队伍。
    【新华社重庆讯】到今年四月份止，重庆市各工厂中的工程技术人员已有二百零一人加入共产党。其中有二十三人是工程师，另外还有一些技师和技术员。这些人几年来受到共产党的教育和培养，政治觉悟不断提高，已具备了作为一个共产党员的条件。一零一钢铁厂工程师邹承祖在党的帮助下，使自己的技术理论和工人的劳动经验紧密结合，并虚心学习苏联先进经验，设计和试轧四十三公斤重轨和八公斤轻轨等新产品顺利成功，现在他已被批准作为一个共产党员。一零二钢铁厂炼钢车间技术主任李先银从许多切身体验中，深深地感到只有在共产党的领导下，技术才能提高，智慧才能发挥，知识才能得到充分的运用。他提出了入党的请求，并在一九五三年底获得了共产党员的光荣称号。
    许多刚入党的工程技术人员，在党的继续教育下，更积极地起着模范作用。工程师何源海，带动小组学习苏联先进经验，首先在全厂试验“高速切削法”成功；在新产品的试制中，他又创造了“快速识图法”，使全车间百分之七十五的图盲、半图盲在六小时内能看懂简易图表，缩短了新产品试制时间，他的技术小组已先后获得了十五次奖励。重庆六一零自动布机布厂车间主任杜立俊依靠党的领导，团结技术人员和老工人，组织技术研究组，使每一台布机的单位产量由两码提高到四码五，次布率由百分之七十和八十降低到百分之五以下。在最近举行的全市工业劳动模范代表会议上，他并被评为全市乙等工业劳动模范。
