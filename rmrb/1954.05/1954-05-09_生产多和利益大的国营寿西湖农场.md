    State-owned Shouxi Lake Farm Produces More and Has Greater Profits
    Qiu Dong
    Editor's Note: The state-owned Shouxi Lake Farm was established under extremely difficult conditions. This farm achieved high production and significant profits in its early stages. The experience of Shouxi Lake Farm is worth referencing and learning from for state-owned farms in various regions.
    The state-owned Shouxi Lake Farm was originally a branch of the state-owned Zhengyangguan Farm. It was restructured into an independently operated animal-powered farm in 1952, and then further transformed into a mechanized farm in the autumn of 1953. It is located in the delta where the Huai River and the Dongfei River meet, west of Shou County, Anhui Province. The land is lake depression land reclaimed from the Huai River project. The total area is approximately 50,000 mu, with 9,200 mu of cultivated land by the end of 1953. The main crops are wheat, soybeans, and rice. In 1953, the average yield of grain crops reached 162.7 jin per mu, which was 7.4 percent higher than the local farmers' yield of 151.5 jin per mu, resulting in a total surplus of 360 million yuan for the year.

    Why was Shouxi Lake Farm able to achieve profitable production in its early stages?

    First, meticulous calculation in every aspect, making do with whatever was available, and doing everything to improve production demonstrated the superiority of the socialist state-owned farm. The leading cadres of the farm clearly recognized in the early stages of construction that to run the farm well, they must have a spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship. Comrade Ding Wenshan, the farm director, was a veteran cadre who participated in the First Revolutionary Civil War. He often said to the staff: "We must use the spirit of opening up the red revolutionary base areas to run the farm, starting from scratch and growing from small to large." Once, a new cadre who had just arrived made a plan to install electric lights and telephones requiring 16 million yuan and asked Director Ding to approve it. Director Ding said, "Put it away for now!" The comrade said, "I can't see with kerosene lamps." Director Ding said, "Didn't we still get things done with bean oil lamps in the past?"

    From 1952 to the end of 1953, the farm's total investment was 1.572 billion yuan, of which only 453 million yuan was used for capital construction, accounting for 28.8 percent of the total investment. Eighty-nine percent of this was used to purchase essential draft animals and farm tools for production. The newly built forty workers' dormitories cost an average of 58,600 yuan per square meter. The houses had grass roofs, wooden frames, and walls plastered with sorghum stalks, generally lasting for five years, or seven to eight years with repairs. The new machinery warehouse cost 62,000 yuan per square meter, the quality was the same, but it was taller, allowing combine harvesters to enter and exit freely. The farm only purchased wood and hired a few skilled workers to build these dormitories and machine sheds; the grass, sorghum stalks, and unskilled labor were all provided by the farm itself.

    At the end of 1953, the farm had a total of 185 employees, of whom 93 percent were production personnel and 7 percent were management personnel. There were only thirteen cadres who were detached from production. The captains, deputy captains, and statisticians of the three production teams were all farmers who did not leave production. For example, the second team had 69 people managing 6,200 mu of land, with one captain, one deputy captain, one statistician, two pig farmers, 55 farmworkers, two cooks, and seven feeders (one person feeding seven or eight head of cattle). On average, each person was responsible for nearly 90 mu of cultivated land. In addition to buying vegetables, cooking, managing food accounts, delivering food, and delivering water, the cooks sometimes had to work in the fields. In addition to managing land measurement and accounting, the statistician also served as a storekeeper, handled general affairs, and issued team wages, without leaving production. The farm's accounting office had a total of three people, who also helped with supply and marketing work, buying seeds, selling grain, and also working in the fields during the busy season, spending about ninety days a year in the fields.

    A cow eats twenty jin of rice straw a day, costing seventy yuan per jin. Every year from May, the feeders stop feeding straw and drive the cattle out to pasture. The farm has a total of 99 cattle, which saved 24.948 million yuan in straw costs per year. The farm's cattle are all fed very well. The pigs are also well-fed. The farm raises a total of 263 pigs. The feeders drive the pigs to a place padded with straw to defecate and urinate, and then drive them back to the pigsty. This not only allows the pigs to exercise but also accumulates fertilizer and maintains hygiene. The farm's pigs have never been sick.

    Second, actively learn from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union and the successful experience of local farmers, improve farming techniques, plant according to local conditions, and increase yields to ensure planting and harvest. The cultivated land of Shouxi Lake Farm is all lake depression land, which is prone to summer floods. Therefore, the farm adopted the method of planting according to local conditions to ensure planting and harvest. On high-lying land that is not easily affected by summer floods, they planted two crops of beans and wheat. On land that may be subject to summer floods, they only planted wheat or rice. In sandy loam soils, they planted peanuts, etc. This way, they were not afraid of floods and could ensure harvest. In order to increase yields and increase income, the farm workers also learned the advanced farming techniques of the Soviet Union and implemented deep plowing and close planting. Last spring, wheat in most parts of Anhui suffered frost damage, and yields were reduced. The wheat in Shouxi Lake Farm that was less affected, because it was deep-plowed and densely planted, still had a yield of up to 370 jin per mu. At the same time, deep plowing also reduced flood damage. Director Ding said, "Because we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implemented deep plowing, even with 120 millimeters of rain in one day and night, there was no water accumulation in the fields, while in 1952, there was a lot of water accumulation with more than 90 millimeters." Last autumn, the machine-sown wheat on the farm had a row spacing of 15 centimeters, and the animal-powered sowing was about 20 centimeters, and the growth was much better than that of local farmers. A survey in early March this year showed that the average number of seedlings per square meter was 430.1, the average number of tillers per plant was 2.89, and the number of tillers per square meter was 1,242.9, reaching 20 centimeters in height; the farmers' wheat had not even left the ground. Based on the current wheat growth, the workers have great confidence in exceeding the planned yield. The farm not only combines practical circumstances to learn the advanced farming techniques of the Soviet Union, but also humbly learns from the successful experience of local farmers. The farmers and workers of the second team said: Our farm's land is not afraid of drought or flooding, and it has good water storage and moisture retention, mainly because we have learned from the Soviet Union's experience of deep plowing and dense planting and the local farmers' method of more plowing and more harrowing. Farmers know that more plowing and harrowing lead to more grain.

    Third, rely on the workers, give play to their enthusiasm, and run the farm well. This is mainly manifested in regularly paying attention to political and ideological education and cultural education for workers, caring about the workers' living and working conditions, and truly formulating production plans from the bottom up. In this way, the workers' sense of ownership is naturally established, and their enthusiasm is fully utilized. The farm workers have a correct understanding of running the farm well. They said: The farm is socialist in nature. If the farm is run well, it will lead the farmers to advance towards socialism, and our lives will be no problem. In the spring of 1953, the farm was once prepared to be closed due to financial difficulties, but the workers were unwilling. The workers said: As long as we can hold on to this socialist position in Shouxi Lake to the end, we are willing to carry rice from home to work. At that time, the farm's life was very hard and the wages were low, but the workers were unwavering. They said: There is sweetness after hardship. The workers have a high degree of confidence in running the farm well. These are all the results of regularly paying attention to political and ideological education for the workers.

    Cultural learning is also widespread and in-depth. Some older workers felt that literacy was very difficult. Some said: "I'm too old, I can't do it!" Director Ding found them and said: "When I was a correspondent at the age of thirty-six, I didn't know a single word, but now I can read everything. As long as you are willing to learn, there is nothing you can't do." When they started learning culture, the Communist Youth League branch mobilized all forty-three members to take the lead. According to the specific situation, one member helped one to three people. The entire farm's workers were thus swept into the upsurge of cultural learning. From 1952 to the present, in less than two years, the illiteracy among the farm's workers (accounting for 90 percent of the farm's workers) has been completely eliminated (most of them are literate in more than 1,500 characters). Wu Jiashan, the captain of the third team, used to be illiterate, but now he can write work reports, and recently he also wrote an application for joining the Party.

    When the farm was first established, the workers lived in thatched sheds, the ground was very damp, and there were many mosquitoes in the lake area in the summer, so the workers could not sleep. In order to protect the workers from dampness and ensure their health, the farm first built forty dormitories and made bunk beds; and paid in advance for the farmers to buy mosquito nets, and then deducted the cost in monthly installments, solving the mosquito net problem.

    Due to the implementation of the principle of relying on the workers to run the farm well, the workers of Shouxi Lake Farm have a high degree of enthusiasm for production. Last year, when planting wheat, it was stipulated that each person should accumulate 500 dan of fertilizer, but on average, each person accumulated 800 dan, solving the fertilization problem for more than 3,000 mu of wheat land. The workers go to the fields to work before dawn, and the masses reflect that the farm has three speeds: "Fast to get up, fast to walk, fast to eat." Last year, the farm threshed 1.6 million jin of grain, which was completely placed in the open air in the barren lake, using straw circles. The farm workers automatically organized themselves to take turns guarding these grains all night long. From these living facts, it can be seen that the farm workers have a high degree of enthusiasm for production and love for the farm.

    The current issues that should be paid attention to are: First, Shouxi Lake Farm was originally an animal-powered farm and lacks experience in managing mechanized farms. If it does not make efforts to learn, it is easy to use human and animal-powered farming methods to carry out mechanized farming operations, resulting in losses. Second, the farm is close to the Huainan Mining Area, which needs a large amount of vegetables, meat, and milk. Therefore, Shouxi Lake Farm can consider developing animal husbandry and vegetable cultivation in a planned manner.

    The experience of Shouxi Lake Farm in construction and management is worth learning from. The workers of Shouxi Lake Farm should cherish their achievements, make persistent efforts, continue to work hard, strictly guard against complacency and arrogance, and strive to further run the mechanized farm well and successfully complete the production tasks for 1954.

    生产多和利益大的国营寿西湖农场
    邱东
    编者按：国营寿西湖农场是在极端艰苦的情况下建立起来的。这个农场在建立初期，就做到了生产多、利益大。寿西湖农场的经验值得各地国营农场参考和学习。
    国营寿西湖农场原是国营正阳关农场的一个分场，一九五二年改建为独立经营的畜力农场，一九五三年秋天又改建为机械农场，位于安徽省寿县城西，淮河与东淝河会合的三角洲。土地为治淮退出的湖洼地；总面积约五万亩，耕地面积至一九五三年底为九千二百亩，主要种植小麦、大豆和水稻，一九五三年粮食作物平均每亩产量达一百六十二点七斤，高出当地农民每亩产量一百五十一点五斤的百分之七点四，全年盈余三亿六千万元。
    寿西湖农场为什么在建场初期就能够作到生产有利呢？
    第一、处处精打细算，因陋就简，一切为了搞好生产，发挥了社会主义性质的国营农场的优越性。农场领导干部在建场初期就明确地认识到要办好农场，必须要有不怕艰苦的创业精神。场长丁文山同志是参加过第一次国内革命战争的老干部，他经常对职工们说：“我们要用过去开辟红色革命根据地的精神来办农场，一切要从无到有，由小到大。”曾经有一位新到场的干部，一来就做了一个需用一千六百万元安装电灯、电话的计划，要求丁场长批准，丁场长说：“你暂时收起来吧！”这位同志说：“点煤油灯看不见。”丁场长说：“过去点豆油灯还不是一样干？”
    从一九五二年到一九五三年底农场投资共十五亿七千二百万元，用于基本建设的只有四亿五千三百万元，占总投资的百分之二十八点八，其中百分之八十九是用来购买生产必需的耕畜和农具。新建造的四十间工人宿舍，平均每平方公尺只有五万八千六百元。房子是草顶、木架、用高粱秆涂泥的墙，一般可用五年，如加修补可用七、八年。新建的机具库每平方公尺为六万二千元，质量同前，但较高大，自动康拜因可以自由出入。农场修建这些宿舍和机库，只购买了木料和请了几个技术工人，草、高粱秆和小工都是农场自己的。
    一九五三年底，农场职工共一百八十五人，其中生产人员占百分之九十三，管理人员占百分之七，全场只有脱离生产的干部十三人。三个生产队的队长、副队长、统计员都是不脱离生产的农工。如第二队六十九人，管理六千二百亩地，有队长、副队长各一人，统计员一人，养猪工二人，农工五十五人，炊事员二人，饲养员七人（一个人饲养耕牛七、八头），平均每人负担近九十亩耕地。炊事员除买菜、做饭、管伙食账、送饭、送水等工作外，有时还要下地干活。统计员除管量地算账，还兼保管、事务和领发全队工资，也不脱离生产。场部会计室共三个人，还帮助做供销工作，买种子、卖粮食，农忙时也下地，一年约有九十天在地里干活。
    一头牛一天吃稻草二十斤，一斤七十元，饲养员一到每年五月就停止喂草赶出去放牧，全场共九十九头牛，这样，一年就省了草钱二千四百九十四万八千元。农场的牛都喂得很健壮。猪也喂得很好，农场共养猪二百六十三头，饲养员到时候把猪赶到垫好草的地方去拉粪撒尿，完了赶回猪圈，这样不但可以使猪运动，而且又能积肥又卫生，农场的猪从来没有发过病。
    第二、积极学习苏联先进生产经验和当地农民成功的经验，改进耕作技术，因地种植，提高产量，保种保收。寿西湖农场的耕地都是湖洼地，容易遭受夏涝。因此，农场采用了因地种植，保种保收的办法，在不容易受夏涝的高地种植豆、麦两季作物，在可能遭受夏涝的地上，只种植小麦或水稻；在沙壤土地种植花生等，这样既不怕涝又能保收。为了提高产量，增加收入，农场职工还学习了苏联的先进耕作技术，实行了深耕密植。去年春天，安徽大部地区的小麦都遭受了霜害，产量降低，寿西湖农场受害较轻的小麦，因为实行了深耕密植，每亩产量仍高达三百七十斤。同时因为实行了深耕，也减轻了水涝灾害，丁场长说：“由于我们学习了苏联先进经验，实行了深耕，一天一夜降雨一百二十公厘，地里也没有积水，而一九五二年下了九十多公厘，就积水很多。”去年秋天农场机播的小麦行距十五公分，畜力播的约二十公分，生长情况比当地农民的好得多。今年三月上旬调查，平均每平方公尺出苗为四百三十点一株，分蘖平均每株为二点八九，每平方公尺分蘖为一千二百四十二点九，高达二十公分；农民的则连地皮还没有离开。根据目前小麦生长情况，工人们对超过计划产量，都有很高的信心。农场不但结合实际情况学习苏联的先进耕作技术，而且也虚心地学习了当地农民的成功经验，第二队的农工同志们说：咱们农场的地不怕旱不怕涝，蓄水保墒都很好，主要是因为我们学习了苏联深耕密植的经验和当地农民多耕多耙的办法，农民都知道多耕耙多打粮。
    第三、依靠职工，发挥职工的积极性，办好农场。这主要表现在经常注意对职工进行政治思想教育和文化教育，关心职工的生活和工作条件，真正做到由下而上地制订生产计划。这样就很自然地树立了职工的主人翁思想，和充分地发挥了职工的积极性。农场工人对办好农场有着正确的认识，他们说：农场是社会主义性质的，办好了农场，就能带领农民向社会主义前进，我们生活也就没有问题。一九五三年春天，农场因为经费困难，曾经一度准备停办，但工人们都不愿意，工人们说：只要能够把寿西湖这块社会主义阵地坚持到底，我们回家背米来干也愿意。当时农场生活很苦，工资也低，但工人毫不动摇，他们说：有苦就有甜。工人们对办好农场的信心都很高。这些都是经常注意向工人进行政治思想教育的结果。
    文化学习也普遍深入。有些年纪大的工人感到识字很困难，有的说：“岁数大啦，不行啦！”丁场长把他们找来说：“我三十六岁当通讯员时，一个字也不识，可是我现在什么都能看，只要肯学，没有不行的。”开始学习文化时，青年团支部动员全体四十三个团员带头，根据具体情况，一个团员帮助一到三个人，全场工人就这样卷入了学习文化的热潮。从一九五二年到现在不到二年的时间，农场职工中的文盲（占全场职工百分之九十）已全部消灭（大部识字在一千五百个以上）。第三队队长吴加山，过去一个字不识，现在能写工作报告，最近又写了入党申请书。
    开始建场的时候，工人住在草棚子里，地上非常潮湿，夏天湖地蚊子也很多，工人不能睡觉。为了使工人不受潮湿和身体健康，农场首先建造了四十间宿舍，做了双层床；并先垫出钱给农工买蚊帐，然后分月扣还，解决了蚊帐问题。
    由于贯彻了依靠职工办好农场的原则，寿西湖农场的工人生产积极性都很高。去年种麦时，规定每人积肥五百担，结果平均每人积了八百担，解决了三千多亩小麦地的施肥问题。工人都是天朦朦亮就到地里干活，群众反映农场有三快：“起床快，走路快，吃饭快”。去年农场打的一百六十万斤粮食，完全用席圈露天放在荒湖里，农场工人都自动组织起来，通宵轮流看守这些粮食。从这些活生生的事实中，可以看出农场工人的生产积极性和对农场的爱护。
    目前应该注意的问题是：一、寿西湖农场原是畜力农场，缺乏经营机械化农场的经验，如不努力学习，很容易搬用人畜力耕作办法来进行机耕作业，造成损失。二、农场靠近淮南矿区，矿区需要大量蔬菜、肉类和牛奶，因而寿西湖农场可考虑有计划地发展畜牧和种菜。
    寿西湖农场的建场和经营管理方面的经验，是值得学习的；寿西湖农场的职工应珍贵自己的成绩，再接再厉，继续努力，严防自满和骄傲，为进一步办好机耕农场和胜利完成一九五四年的生产任务而努力。
