    With the help of the Central People's Government, veterinary disease prevention work in the Changdu region of Tibet has been gradually launched, and the health of livestock has begun to be guaranteed. Over the past three years, the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has established more than ten veterinary disease prevention institutions in Lhasa, Xigaze, Changdu, and other places, providing free prevention and treatment of various epidemic diseases for the livestock of Tibetan people. According to incomplete statistics, more than 90,000 heads of sick and injured livestock were treated in 1953 alone, with a cure rate of 90 percent. These veterinary disease prevention institutions regularly send staff to pastoral areas for mobile treatment. They have successively eradicated more than ten major outbreaks of rinderpest in areas such as Heihe and Lhasa, and have established quarantine stations at major transportation routes. Last summer, rinderpest broke out in southern Qinghai. In order to prevent the epidemic from spreading southward, veterinary staff jointly established a quarantine line stretching thousands of miles from Dengke (under the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province) in the east to Heihe in the west, effectively preventing the spread of the disease. The Changdu Veterinary Disease Prevention Brigade has also established seven veterinary disease prevention stations in the thirteen zong of the Changdu area, providing timely scientific treatment for sick livestock, greatly reducing the mortality rate.
    Veterinary personnel entering Tibet also work in remote pastoral areas, crossing mountains and ridges. Local livestock clinics also regularly send doctors to the homes of Tibetans to diagnose and treat seriously ill and injured livestock. Some livestock clinics have also organized treatment teams and mobile epidemic prevention teams to carry out veterinary disease prevention work in nearby rural areas and pastures, and show slideshows to Tibetans to publicize scientific knowledge of livestock management and feeding methods, and prevention of veterinary diseases. In addition, the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army also held a training course for veterinary disease prevention personnel in Lhasa last year, training more than 60 Tibetan veterinary disease prevention personnel; the Changdu Veterinary Disease Prevention Brigade also trained more than 40 Tibetan veterinary personnel.

    西藏昌都地区开展兽疫防治工作
    西藏、昌都地区兽疫防治工作在中央人民政府帮助下已逐步开展，牲畜的健康开始有了保障。三年来，人民解放军西藏军区先后在拉萨、日喀则、昌都等地设立了十多个兽疫防治机构，免费给藏族人民的牲畜防治各种疫病，据不完全统计，仅一九五三年内就防治病伤牲畜九万多头，治愈率达百分之九十。这些兽疫防治机构经常派出工作人员深入牧区巡回治疗，曾先后在黑河、拉萨等地区扑灭了十多次较大的牛瘟，并在各交通要道设立检疫站。去年夏天，青海南部发生牛瘟，为了防止瘟疫向南流传，兽医工作人员曾联合建立了东起邓柯（西康省藏族自治区所属）西至黑河长达数千里的防疫线，有效地制止了疫病的蔓延。昌都兽疫防治大队还在昌都地区的十三个宗内设立了七个兽疫防治站，对患病的牲畜及时进行科学的治疗，使死亡率大大降低。
    进藏兽医人员还翻山越岭深入偏远的牧区工作，各地的家畜门诊所也经常派医生到藏民家里去诊治重病和重伤的牲畜，有些家畜诊疗所还组织了治疗小组和流动防疫组，到附近的农村和牧场进行兽疫防治工作，并放映幻灯向藏民们宣传家畜管理和饲养方法及预防兽疫的科学常识。此外，人民解放军西藏军区去年还在拉萨举办兽疫防治人员训练班，培养了六十多名藏族兽疫防治人员；昌都兽疫防治大队也训练了四十多名藏族兽医人员。
