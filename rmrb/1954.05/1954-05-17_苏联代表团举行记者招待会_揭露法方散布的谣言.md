Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 16th: The Soviet delegation attending the Geneva Conference held a press conference for Soviet and foreign journalists on May 15th. The Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ilyichev, introduced to the journalists the content of French Foreign Minister Bidault's letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding the evacuation of severely wounded personnel from Dien Bien Phu, as well as Molotov's reply.

During the press conference, journalists raised several questions. One asked: "Are you aware of a news item published in the French newspaper 'Libération' on the 15th, reporting on Bidault's report to the French government regarding the progress of the Geneva Conference?" Ilyichev replied: "Yes, I am. This news item in 'Libération' has drawn the attention of the Soviet delegation. According to this report, the press is widely circulating the idea that Mr. Bidault reported to the French government on the progress of the Geneva Conference, stating that the French delegation had supposedly hoped to contact representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to exchange views on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. It is said that the French delegation encountered the stubborn attitude of Ho Chi Minh's representatives, who were unwilling to engage with the French delegation on this matter."

"Reliable sources inform us that neither at the beginning of the Geneva Conference nor afterwards did the French delegation ever hope to contact any representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to exchange views on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. As reported at the Soviet delegation's press conference, representatives of the French delegation had discussed with representatives of the Soviet delegation on April 28th, expressing the hope to 'resolve the issue of evacuating the wounded from the Dien Bien Phu area'. It is well known that the Soviet delegation expressed sympathy for this and hoped that the issue of evacuating the wounded could be resolved immediately, and that representatives of the parties concerned would meet immediately to resolve the aforementioned issue as quickly as possible."

"It is also well known that representatives of the French delegation met with representatives of the People's Republic of China delegation on May 6th, expressing the hope to evacuate the wounded from the Dien Bien Phu area. The representatives of the Chinese delegation expressed sympathy for this wish and expressed the opinion that in order to resolve the issue of evacuating the wounded, the Foreign Ministers' meeting should discuss this issue on May 7th when discussing the Indochina issue."

"The French delegation was not concerned with this wish, and the discussion of the Indochina issue was postponed for a day due to the suggestions of the French, British, and American delegations."

"I hope that my remarks regarding the news published in the French 'Libération' will draw everyone's attention."

    苏联代表团举行记者招待会
    揭露法方散布的谣言
    【新华社日内瓦十六日电】出席日内瓦会议的苏联代表团在五月十五日举行苏联记者及外国记者的招待会。苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫在记者招待会上向记者们介绍了法国外交部部长皮杜尔给苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫关于自奠边府撤退重伤人员的信件的内容，以及莫洛托夫的复信的内容。
    出席招待会的记者提出了一些问题。有人问：法国“解放报”十五日刊登了一则消息，报道皮杜尔给法国政府的关于日内瓦会议进展情况的报告，你知道这条消息吗？伊利切夫回答说：是的，知道。“解放报”上的这条消息已引起了苏联代表团的注意。根据该报的这条消息，新闻界盛传：皮杜尔先生向法国政府报告日内瓦会议的进展情况说，似乎法国代表团曾希望和越南民主共和国代表团的代表接触，以便就恢复印度支那和平问题交换意见。据说，法国代表团碰上了胡志明的代表不愿意就这一问题和法国代表团进行联系的顽固态度。
    从权威人士获悉：无论是日内瓦会议开始时或者以后，法国代表团都不曾希望和越南民主共和国的任何一个代表接触，以便就恢复印度支那和平问题交换意见。苏联代表团的记者招待会上已报道过，法国代表团代表曾在四月二十八日和苏联代表团代表商谈，表示希望“解决从奠边府区撤走伤员的问题”。大家知道，苏联代表团曾对此表示同情，希望撤走伤员的问题能立即解决，并希望有关方面的代表立即会面以尽量快地解决上述问题。
    大家也知道，法国代表团代表于五月六日会见了中华人民共和国代表团的代表，表示希望从奠边府区撤走伤员。中国代表团的代表曾表示同情这一愿望，并表示意见说：为了解决撤走伤员的问题，外长会议五月七日讨论印度支那问题时应该讨论这一问题。
    法国代表团并不关心这一愿望，而且由于法国英国和美国三国代表团的建议，印度支那问题的讨论推迟了一天。
    我希望，我关于法国“解放报”刊载的消息所讲的这些话能引起大家的注意。
