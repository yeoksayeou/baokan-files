    Do a Good Job in Production Preparation for Newly Built and Expanded Factories and Mines
    Li Gongran
    In order to continuously expand our country's industrial production, we must not only be good at leveraging the role of existing enterprises, but also ensure that newly built enterprises are put into production on schedule and in good condition according to plan. Therefore, we must pay great attention to the production preparation work of newly built and expanded enterprises.
    More than a year of experience has proven that newly built and expanded factories and mines that have emphasized production preparation work have been put into production relatively quickly. Neglecting production preparation work will seriously affect the timely commissioning of these enterprises; or even if they can start work, the production situation will not be normal. This will fail to create new wealth for the country on time and in quantity. From the perspective of the trend of national construction and development, the number of newly built enterprises is increasing year by year, the scale is expanding year by year, and the technical complexity is also increasing year by year. This year alone, dozens of newly built and expanded factories and mines across the country will be put into production one after another, including some key projects designed for us by the Soviet Union with sophisticated technology and magnificent engineering, which were rare in old China. After these newly built and expanded factories and mines are completed, if no preparations have been made in advance, and there is a lack of strong organizational leadership, sound organizational structures, scientific management systems, sufficient ideological and political work, as well as engineering and technical personnel and a large number of skilled workers who have a preliminary grasp of advanced technologies, it will be impossible to put them into production smoothly.
    What issues should be paid attention to in the production preparation work of newly built and expanded enterprises?
    First, we should actively equip and train cadres (including administrative cadres and technical cadres) and skilled workers, and organize them to learn new technologies and advanced Soviet experience. This is the key to production preparation work. The current situation is: on the one hand, there is a feeling that technical cadres and skilled workers are insufficient, but on the other hand, some departments and some newly constructed units do not pay enough attention to cadre allocation and training, which to a certain extent affects production. Some factories and mines have been forced to postpone the date of commissioning due to the lack of timely allocation of technical cadres. Some units prepared cadres and technicians for newly built factories and mines, originally scheduled to go abroad for internships in the summer of 1953, but were repeatedly postponed due to insufficient preparation, and the final number of interns sent was still far from the requirements of the plan. Some departments have been perfunctory in the work of training cadres and technicians, and have not combined technical theory with production practice in education. Some units have only done general technical training, but have not paid attention to training a complete set of production management cadres and technical cadres, especially grassroots technical cadres. These facts tell us that we must strengthen planning and organization in this area in the future, otherwise we will be powerless in the face of modern technical equipment. In particular, the engineering projects designed by the Soviet Union for our country are technologically complex, with many comprehensive technologies and high quality requirements. This requires us to carefully organize cadres and workers to learn these new technologies in order to master the performance of many automated machines and equipment; to operate many new types of giant machines; to fully exploit the capacity of new equipment; and to ensure safe production. Therefore, learning and mastering advanced technology is one of the main topics of production preparation work for all newly built and expanded units, and must not be treated lightly.
    It is necessary to allocate a certain number of technical cadres to the enterprise in advance, and transfer a certain number of skilled workers from existing factories and mines as the backbone, organize cadres to study the technical design materials and various process regulations, send them to other similar enterprises for internships, and at the same time organize the main technical personnel and technicians to participate in the installation and adjustment work. This will not only play a role in supervising the quality of the project, but also systematically familiarize them with the performance, structure, use, and maintenance methods of the equipment, so that they can skillfully master the operation of the new equipment when it is put into production. When units run training classes, they must pay attention to the teaching methods that combine technical theory with production experience. In addition, they can also entrust relevant schools or scientific institutions to train a group of specialized technical cadres, and designate old factories to train a group of technicians. These units should treat it as an important task of the department to complete.
    For some important new enterprises designed by foreign countries, excellent technicians, technical cadres, and administrative management cadres must be selected in accordance with national regulations, and complete sets of cadres and workers should be sent abroad for internships in a planned and timely manner, which is of great significance for whether they can start production smoothly in the future.
    For the training of production management personnel such as workshop directors and foremen, each department must not only assign existing enterprises to be responsible for certain tasks, but also organize workshop director and foreman training classes in a planned manner to solve the current difficulty of newly built enterprises seriously lacking grassroots cadres.
    Second, we must strengthen acceptance and test operation work. Some units neglect acceptance and test operation work, and find problems when they are officially operating, forcing them to rework, which will also affect the timely start of work. Therefore, we should be responsible for organizing the acceptance of machines and various equipment, and conduct serious technical inspections. After acceptance, we must properly conduct test operation work, because test operation is an important step that must be taken before officially entering production. Test operation work is a rehearsal before production, which can test the quality of installation projects and prevent or reduce accidents that may occur in production. According to advanced Soviet experience, the test operation should be transferred from local test operation to work section test operation, and then to full-load test operation, which guarantees the safe commissioning of equipment. Some newly built units have adopted this advanced experience, and after the test operation stage, they have officially put it into production, so the start of work has been relatively smooth.
    Third, carefully organizing ordering, and doing a good job in preparing raw materials, tools, and spare parts needed for production is an important condition for ensuring normal production. At present, there are still many problems in this regard: some factories neglect the necessary reserves of certain important spare parts, and when they are officially put into production, they find that some spare parts are insufficient, which may lead to work stoppages and reduced production. Therefore, the tools and spare parts attached to the machine equipment must be thoroughly checked. If tools and spare parts are missing or insufficient, orders should be placed immediately or manufactured by themselves. Damaged parts should be repaired in a timely manner; special maintenance settings must also be taken for precision machines and tools and instruments. At the same time, investigations and studies should be carried out in the ordering process. If domestic manufacturers can manufacture them, orders should be placed in China as much as possible; for certain materials that must be ordered abroad, they should also be submitted as early as possible according to the required time, so as to ensure that they arrive on time for production. Orders for raw materials required after the start of work must be placed in a timely manner. If the required raw materials are not currently produced in China, they should be discussed with relevant departments as soon as possible for trial production, and strive to have these raw materials supplied by domestic sources as much as possible. In the process of carrying out this production preparation work, equipment cards, drawings, spare parts quotas, raw material consumption quotas, and other management systems should be gradually established.
    In order to ensure the timely, quantitative, and qualitative supply of ordering work, various undertaking departments and relevant units serving newly built and expanded factories and mines need to provide strong support and actively cooperate.
    Fourth, we must strengthen organizational construction, which is an important guarantee for newly built enterprises to do a good job in production preparation. In the past, some units' organizational construction could not keep up with the needs of the work, or even if there was an organization, the division of labor was unclear and the responsibilities were unclear, resulting in insufficient production preparation work, or the preparation work was not linked before and after, resulting in confusion, passivity, and no one being responsible for the phenomenon in the work. Therefore, in the process of project implementation, newly built enterprises should establish production preparation organizations in a timely manner, and designate a deputy factory director to lead the preparation work, and equip personnel and institutions as completely as possible before the start of work according to the order in which workshops start work. From the existing experience, the personnel and education department should be set up first to be responsible for formulating labor plans, personnel allocation, and training work; the mechanical and electrical department should be set up to be responsible for understanding, inspecting, and mastering equipment, and timely preparation of production tools and spare parts; and the production technology section should be established to be responsible for formulating technical standards, procedures, and new product trial production. After the product plan is determined, the technical supply section should organize raw material ordering and supply.
    The organization of each workshop and work section should be organized and appointed workshop directors and foremen and other cadres before the start of work according to the principle of production area management system, so that all employees can work in an orderly manner during the test operation.
    Finally, to complete the above-mentioned main preparation work, we must do a good job in ideological and political work. New enterprises often affect production because ideological and political work is not done enough or not well. The workers and cadres of these enterprises are gathered from all directions, they are not familiar with each other, and their lifestyles and requirements are not entirely consistent. In addition, there are some differences in regional wages, so the situation is very complicated. The leaders of newly built enterprises must take the initiative to grasp and analyze various ideological situations, carry out a series of ideological and political work and organizational work in a planned and step-by-step manner, and care about their lives, in order to organize them to do a good job in various production preparation work, so that newly built enterprises can be put into production on time or ahead of schedule.
    The experience of production preparation work of newly built enterprises in various places is still very insufficient. We need to work hard to accumulate experience and pay attention to timely summary, do a good job in production preparation work, so that newly built and expanded enterprises can be put into production as soon as possible, so that our socialist industry can develop rapidly.

    做好新建扩建厂矿的生产准备工作
    李公然
    为了不断地扩大我国工业生产，我们既要善于发挥现有企业的作用，又要使新建企业按照计划及时地很好地投入生产。因此，必须十分重视新建扩建企业的生产准备工作。
    一年多的经验证明，新建扩建厂矿企业凡是重视了生产准备工作的，投入生产的时间就比较快。而忽视了生产准备工作的，就会严重地影响这些企业按时投入生产；或者虽能开工，但生产情况也不正常。这就不能按时按量地为国家创造新的财富。从国家建设发展的趋势来看，新建企业的数量正逐年增加，规模逐年扩大，技术复杂程度也逐年增高。今年全国即有好几十个新建扩建厂矿将要陆续投入生产，其中包括苏联为我们设计的一些技术精湛、工程宏伟的重点工程，这在旧中国是罕见的。这些新建扩建厂矿竣工后，如果事前没有做好准备工作，缺乏坚强的组织领导、健全的组织机构、科学的管理制度、充分的思想政治工作，以及具有初步掌握先进技术的工程技术人员与广大的技术工人，那是不可能顺利投入生产的。
    在新建扩建企业的生产准备工作中，应该注意那些问题呢？
    首先，应该积极配备与培养训练干部（包括行政干部和技术干部）和技术工人，组织他们学习新技术，学习苏联先进经验。这是生产准备工作的关键。目前的情况是：一方面感到技术干部与技术工人不足，但另一方面某些部门和一些新建设的单位对干部配备与培养训练工作还不够重视，因而在一定程度上影响了生产。有的厂矿由于没有及时配备技术干部，以致投入生产的日期被迫推迟。有些单位为新建厂矿准备的干部和技工，原订一九五三年夏季出国实习，因准备不足一再推迟，最后派出的实习生仍距计划的要求很远。有些部门在培养训练干部与技工工作中草率从事，没有把技术理论与生产实践结合起来进行教育。有些单位只做了一般的技术训练，而没有注意培养训练成套的生产管理干部和技术干部，尤其是基层技术干部。这些事实告诉我们，今后在这方面也必须加强计划性与组织性，否则我们将在现代技术装备面前无能为力。特别是苏联为我国所设计的工程项目，其技术是复杂的，综合性的技术多，质量要求高。这就必须要认真地组织干部和工人学习这些新技术，才能掌握许多自动化机器设备性能；才能操纵许多新式的巨型机器；才能充分发挥新式设备能力；才能保证安全生产。因此，学习与掌握先进技术是一切新建扩建单位生产准备工作主要课题之一，绝不能以轻率态度对待。
    必须提前给企业分配一定数量的技术干部，并从现有厂矿抽调一定数量的技术工人为骨干，组织干部对技术设计资料及各种工艺规程进行研究与学习，派他们到其他类似企业实习，同时并组织主要技术人员与技工参加安装、调整工作，这样既能起监督工程质量的作用，又可系统地熟悉设备性能、构造、使用以及维护检修等方法，以便转入生产时，他们能熟练地掌握新设备操作。各单位办训练班时，必须注意技术理论与生产经验相结合的教学方法。此外还可委托有关学校或科学机关培养训练一批专业技术干部，并指定老厂培养训练一批技工，这些单位应当把它当作本部门一项重要的任务来完成。
    国外设计的某些重要的新建企业，必须按照国家的规定选择优秀技工、技术干部和行政管理干部，有计划地及时将成套的干部和工人派出国去实习，这对将来能否顺利开工生产有极重大意义。
    对于车间主任、工长等生产管理人员的培养训练工作，各部门除指定现有企业负责一定任务外，还须有计划地组织车间主任和工长训练班，以解决目前新建企业严重地缺少基层干部的困难。
    第二，必须加强验收与试运转工作。有的单位疏于验收和试车工作，正式运转时发现毛病而被迫返工，这也会影响按时开工。因此应该对机器及各种设备负责组织验收工作，认真地进行技术检查，在验收后并要妥善地进行试车工作，因为试车是正式转入生产前的必经的重要步骤，试车工作是生产前的预演，可以考验安装工程质量，可以防止或减少在生产中可能发生的事故。根据苏联先进经验，应先由局部试车转到工段试车，再全负荷试车，这就保证设备安全地投入生产。有些新建单位就是采用这种先进经验，经过试车阶段再正式投入生产，因而开工就较顺利。
    第三，认真组织订货，做好生产所需要的原材料、工具及备品准备工作，是保证进入正常生产的重要条件。目前这方面还存在着不少问题：有些厂忽视某些重要备品必要的储备，待正式生产时，发现某些备品不足，以致有停工减产的可能。因此必须对机器设备上附属的工具、备品加以彻底清查，缺少工具备品或者不足的，就应立即提出订货或自行组织制造，碰损机件应及时检修；对精密机器及工具仪器还须采取特殊的保养设置。同时在订货中还应进行调查研究，国内能制造者，应尽量在国内订货；对某些材料必须在国外订货者，也应根据需要时间及早提出，以便保证按时到货进行生产。对开工后所需要的原材料更要及时提出订货，如所需原材料目前国内尚未生产，应及早与有关部门协商，以便进行试制，争取这些原材料尽可能由国内供应。在进行此项生产准备工作过程中，应把设备卡片、图纸、备品定额、原材料消耗定额及其他管理制度等逐步建立起来。
    为了订货工作保证定时、定量、定质的供应，就需要各承制部门以及为新建扩建厂矿服务的有关单位大力支援与积极地配合。
    第四，必须加强组织建设，这是新建企业做好生产准备工作的重要保证。过去有的单位组织建设赶不上工作需要，或者有了组织，但分工不明，职责不清，造成了某些生产准备工作不足，或准备工作前后不相衔接，工作中产生混乱被动与无人负责现象。因此新建企业在工程进行的过程中，及时地建立生产准备组织，并指定专责副厂长领导准备工作，根据车间开工先后的情况，将人员及机构尽可能地在开工前基本上配备齐全。就已有经验来看，应当先设置人事、教育科以负责制订劳动计划与人员配备及其培养训练工作；设置机械电动部门，负责了解、检查与掌握设备，及时进行生产工具及备品准备工作；建立生产技术科负责制订技术标准、规程、新产品试制等工作。产品方案确定后，技术供应科应组织原材料订货供应等工作。
    各车间及工段的组织在开工前应根据生产区域管理制原则，进行组织并委派车间主任及工长等干部，以便在试车时使所有职工都能有秩序地进行工作。
    最后，要完成以上各项主要准备工作，必须做好思想政治工作。新企业往往因思想政治工作做得不够或不好而影响生产。这些企业的工人、干部都是从四面八方集合起来的，他们互不熟悉，生活作风与要求都不尽一致，加上地区工资某些差异，情况是很复杂的。新建企业的领导者，必须主动地掌握与分析各种思想情况，有计划有步骤地进行一系列的思想政治工作与组织工作，并关心他们的生活，以便组织他们做好各项生产准备工作，使新建企业能按时或提前投入生产。
    各地新建企业生产准备工作的经验还很不足，需要努力在工作中积累经验，并注意及时总结，把生产准备工作做好，使新建扩建企业早日投入生产，使我们的社会主义工业能够迅速发展。
