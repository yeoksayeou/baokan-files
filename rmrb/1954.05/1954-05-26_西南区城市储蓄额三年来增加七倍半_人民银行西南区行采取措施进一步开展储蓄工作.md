    Urban savings work in various branches of the People's Bank of China in the Southwest region has greatly developed over the past few years. By the end of last year, the amount of urban savings deposits in the region had increased seven and a half times compared to 1950, exceeding the amount of loans granted by the National Bank to state-owned industries in the Southwest region last year.
    With the improvement of the lives of the broad masses of people and the promotion of savings propaganda, urban residents in various parts of the Southwest are increasingly depositing money in the National Bank. Last year, the Chongqing branch of the People's Bank of China had more than 310,000 savings accounts, an increase of 22 times compared to 1950. Many employees have gradually developed the habit of saving money, and every time they receive their wages, they deposit the money they do not need for the time being into the National Bank.
    In order to cooperate with the country's socialist industrialization and further strengthen and improve urban savings work, the Southwest Branch of the People's Bank of China convened the first regional urban savings work forum in late April. The meeting decided that in the future, savings propaganda should be widely carried out to make the broad masses of people understand the significance of saving; the organizational structure should be strengthened, and savings work cadres should be trained and improved; small savings institutions should be gradually increased, savings collection hours should be changed, and, on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, departments, troops, people's organizations, etc., should be entrusted to pilot agency savings business.

    西南区城市储蓄额三年来增加七倍半
    人民银行西南区行采取措施进一步开展储蓄工作
    西南区各地人民银行的城市储蓄工作，几年来有很大发展。到去年年底，全区城市储蓄存款额比一九五零年增加了七倍半，超过了去年国家银行对西南区国营工业的放款额。
    随着广大人民生活的改善和储蓄宣传的开展，西南各地城市居民向国家银行存款的日益增多。去年，中国人民银行重庆分行的储蓄户达三十一万多户，比一九五零年增加了二十二倍。许多职工已逐渐养成节约储蓄的习惯，每到发工资的时候，就把暂时不用的钱存入国家银行。
    为了配合国家社会主义工业化，进一步加强和改进城市储蓄工作，中国人民银行西南区行于四月下旬召开了全区第一次城市储蓄工作座谈会。会上决定，今后要广泛开展储蓄宣传工作，使广大群众了解节约储蓄的意义；加强组织机构，培养和提高储蓄工作干部；逐步增设小型储蓄机构，改变收储时间，并在自愿两利的原则下，委托机关、部队、人民团体等试办代理储蓄业务。
