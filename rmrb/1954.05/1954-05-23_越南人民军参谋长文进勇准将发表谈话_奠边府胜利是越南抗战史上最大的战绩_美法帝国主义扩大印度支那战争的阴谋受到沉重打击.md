Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency on May 20th: General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army, Brigadier General Văn Tiến Dũng, recently spoke at a press conference about the significant meaning of the Điện Biên Phủ victory. He said: The victory of the Vietnam People's Army at Điện Biên Phủ is a heavy blow to the conspiracy of American interventionists and French colonialist war-mongers to expand the war of aggression in Indochina.

Văn Tiến Dũng pointed out: The Điện Biên Phủ victory is the greatest achievement in the history of the Vietnam People's Army's war of resistance and also the biggest defeat in the history of French imperialist colonial wars. In terms of troop strength, the People's Army annihilated twenty-one regular enemy battalions at Điện Biên Phủ, which is equivalent to two-fifths of the mobile forces that the commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in Indochina, Navarre, assembled in North Vietnam at the beginning of the Vietnam People's Army's Autumn-Winter Campaign last year. And these enemy troops were annihilated in the most fortified stronghold defended with modern weapons supplied by American interventionists.

Văn Tiến Dũng continued: On our side, the Vietnam People's Army has made great progress. The Vietnam People's Army has developed from attacking individual strong enemy strongholds and annihilating some scattered enemy battalions, to attacking fortified group strongholds and annihilating twenty-one enemy battalions; the Vietnam People's Army has developed from conducting small-scale attacks on individual strong French strongholds to conducting relatively large-scale attacks using positional warfare.

Văn Tiến Dũng then spoke about the impact of the Điện Biên Phủ victory on the military situation in Indochina. He said: In the winter of last year and the spring of this year, Điện Biên Phủ was the focus of the entire Indochina battlefield.

After suffering defeat in Korea, the American imperialists intensified their intervention in the Indochina War, plotting to prolong and expand the hostilities, attempting to turn the peninsula into an American military base and use it as a springboard for aggression in Southeast Asia. In order to realize this conspiracy, the American imperialists colluded further with the French colonialist war-mongers and their puppets. They formulated the so-called "Navarre Plan" to eliminate most of our regular army controlling a large part of Vietnamese territory, eliminate the People's Liberation Armies of Cambodia and Laos, and control all the territories of these two countries.

Văn Tiến Dũng continued: At the beginning of March this year, Navarre declared that the Vietnam People's Army, the Cambodian People's Liberation Army, and the Laotian People's Liberation Army could no longer launch large-scale offensives, and the situation would change in a few weeks, with the French army launching a counter-offensive. But after Navarre widely dispersed his regular army on various fronts and transferred some regular troops to the Tuy Hòa area in central and southern Vietnam in mid-March, the Vietnam People's Army launched a large-scale offensive against Điện Biên Phủ on March 13; at the same time, the People's Army strengthened its activities in the Red River Delta, cutting off Strategic Highway No. 5. The Cambodian People's Liberation Army also launched an offensive against the enemy in northeastern Cambodia.

Văn Tiến Dũng said: In this situation, Navarre had to rush to transfer his active forces from other fronts to reinforce Điện Biên Phủ. The French and American imperialists also hurriedly gathered military forces, with France sending reinforcements, and the United States sending more bombers, transport planes, and air force personnel to Indochina, and transporting more weapons and ammunition from the Philippines and Japan. The imperialists were determined to hold Điện Biên Phủ. Nevertheless, the Vietnam People's Army completely uprooted the French strongholds at Điện Biên Phủ.

Văn Tiến Dũng emphasized: One year after the implementation of the "Navarre Plan," the military situation in Indochina has undergone tremendous changes, unfavorable to the enemy and favorable to us. The enemy had increased its regular army and expanded its puppet army, but since November 1953, the enemy forces annihilated have reached 80,000; the enemy attempted to gain the initiative in combat, but the only initiative Navarre gained was to disperse his active forces on various fronts and throw his troops into Điện Biên Phủ to be completely annihilated by us. The enemy attempted to occupy most of Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos. However, now our liberated areas are further consolidated: In North Vietnam, guerrilla bases and guerrilla zones occupy two-thirds of the enemy's rear areas; in South Vietnam, our liberated areas and guerrilla zones have expanded; in Liên khu V (central and southern Vietnam), the enemy occupied Tuy Hòa, but we liberated Kon Tum Province. The liberated areas of Cambodia and Laos have also expanded.

    越南人民军参谋长文进勇准将发表谈话
    奠边府胜利是越南抗战史上最大的战绩
    美法帝国主义扩大印度支那战争的阴谋受到沉重打击
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社二十日讯：越南人民军参谋长文进勇准将最近在记者招待会上谈奠边府胜利的重大意义。他说：越南人民军在奠边府的胜利，是对美国干涉者和法国殖民主义战争贩子扩大印度支那侵略战争阴谋的沉重打击。
    文进勇指出：奠边府的胜利是越南人民军抗战史上最大的战绩，也是法帝国主义者殖民战争史上最大的失败。就兵力而论，人民军在奠边府已歼灭了敌军二十一个正规营，即等于驻在印度支那的法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔在去年越南人民军发动的秋冬战役开始时集结在北越的机动部队的五分之二。而这些敌军是在用美国干涉者供应的现代化武器防守的敌军最坚固的集团据点里被歼灭的。
    文进勇继续说：在我们方面，越南人民军有了很大的进展。越南人民军从进攻敌军的个别的强固据点，歼灭分散的敌军的一些营，发展到进攻强固的集团据点，歼灭敌军二十一个营；越南人民军从对法军个别的强固据点进行小规模的进攻，发展到用阵地战方式进行比较大规模的进攻。
    文进勇接着谈到奠边府的胜利对印度支那的军事局势的影响。他说：在去年冬天和今年春天，奠边府是整个印度支那战场上的焦点。
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜遭到失败后，他们就加紧了对印度支那战争的干涉，阴谋拖延并扩大敌对行动，企图把这个半岛变成美国的军事基地，把它用作侵略东南亚的跳板。为了要实现这种阴谋，美帝国主义者与法国殖民主义战争贩子和他们的傀儡进一步勾结。他们拟定了所谓“纳瓦尔计划”，要消灭控制着大部越南领土的我们的正规军的大部分，消灭高棉和寮国的人民解放军，并控制这两个国家的全部领土。
    文进勇接着说：在今年三月初的时候，纳瓦尔宣称，越南人民军、高棉人民解放军和寮国人民解放军再也不可能进行较大规模的进攻，在几个星期内局势将有改变，法军将发动反攻。但是等到纳瓦尔把他的正规军广泛地分散在各个战线，并于三月中旬增调了一些正规军到中越南部的绥和地区以后，越南人民军在三月十三日向奠边府发动了大规模的攻势；同时，人民军加强了在红河三角洲的活动，截断了第五号战略公路。高棉人民解放军也在高棉的东北部向敌人发动了进攻。
    文进勇说：在这种情况下，纳瓦尔不得不匆匆地把他的有生力量从其他战线上调来增援奠边府。法、美帝国主义者也匆忙地集结军事力量，法国派来了援兵，美国派了更多的轰炸机和运输机及空军人员来印度支那，并且从菲律宾和日本运来了更多的武器和弹药。帝国主义者决心要守住奠边府。虽然如此，越南人民军还是完全拔除了奠边府的法军据点。
    文进勇强调指出：在实行“纳瓦尔计划”一年以后，印度支那的军事形势有了巨大的改变，不利于敌人而有利于我们。敌人曾经增加了正规军和扩大了伪军，然而自从一九五三年十一月以后，被歼灭的敌军就达八万名；敌人企图取得作战的主动权，然而纳瓦尔所得的主动权只是把他的有生力量分散在各个战线上并且把他的军队投到奠边府来让我们全部歼灭。敌人企图占领越南的大部分土地和高棉、寮国。但是，现在我们的解放区进一步巩固了：在北越，游击基地和游击区占敌人后方地区的三分之二；在南越，我们的解放区和游击区已经扩大了；在第五联区（中越南部），敌人占领了绥和，但是我们解放了昆嵩省。高棉和寮国的解放区也扩大了。
