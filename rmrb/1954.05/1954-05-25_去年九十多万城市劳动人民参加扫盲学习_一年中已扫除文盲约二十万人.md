Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: In 1953, major cities across the country broadly launched literacy campaigns. In addition to factory and mining enterprise workers, approximately 950,000 urban workers and people participated in literacy classes, and about 200,000 people became literate in one year. Furthermore, around 130,000 people participated in spare-time primary school classes, and approximately 13,000 people graduated.

Graduates from literacy classes generally recognized 1,500 to 2,000 commonly used characters, were able to read popular books and newspapers, knew how to keep accounts, and could write simple notes. Some could even write letters and short articles of two to three hundred characters, thereby improving their work skills and production enthusiasm. Through cultural studies, various localities cultivated many street activists, and many people actively participated in street work and social activities. For example, in the Second District, Seventh Street of Taiyuan City, more than 180 out of over 200 cadres were literacy class students. During the general election campaign, two-thirds of the voter group leaders in the Second District, Third Street of Taiyuan City were graduates of literacy classes; in the Second District, Seventh Street, 85 people participated in voter registration and food supply certificate writing, and over 90 people participated in social and cultural activities such as reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and singing propagation stations. In Harbin, during key tasks such as the general election and support for the army and preferential treatment for families of soldiers, students from the citizens' spare-time schools formed Yangko dance teams and picture commentary groups for publicity. After studying, An Minzhong, a housewife in Beijing, served as a group leader in the general election and could write report outlines. She helped residents study current affairs and organized reading groups, which were very popular among the residents, and she was elected as a street public security committee member and women's committee member by the residents. Many people obtained employment opportunities or were admitted to technical schools after studying culture.

In 1953, various localities rectified the literacy work and implemented the method of "government leadership, mass self-management." Based on the masses' living and production conditions, under the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, the masses were relied upon to use their own manpower and resources to run schools under leadership. For example, in Xi'an City, before the rectification, there were 85 mass self-run classes and groups with more than 1,600 students. After the rectification, they developed into more than 180 classes and groups with more than 6,000 students. In Shijiazhuang City, there were more than 6,200 students in December 1952, but nearly 2,000 dropped out by April 1953. After the rectification, the number of students increased to more than 4,620, in addition to many scattered study groups.

    去年九十多万城市劳动人民参加扫盲学习
    一年中已扫除文盲约二十万人
    【新华社二十四日讯】一九五三年全国各大中城市较普遍地开展了扫除文盲工作，除厂矿企业职工外，参加扫盲学习的城市劳动人民约有九十五万人，一年中约扫除了文盲二十万人。另外参加业余高小班学习的约有十三万人，毕业了约一万三千人。
    扫盲班毕业的学员，一般都认识了一千五百到两千常用字，能阅读通俗书报，会记帐、会写简单的便条，有的并能写二三百字的信件和短文，因而提高了工作能力和生产积极性。通过文化学习，各地培养了不少街道积极分子，许多人积极参加了街道工作和社会活动。如太原市二区七街二百多名干部中，就有一百八十多人是扫盲班的学员。在普选运动中，太原市二区三街选民小组长，有三分之二是扫盲班毕业的学员；二区七街有八十五人曾分别参加选民登记和粮食供应证的缮写工作，九十多人参加读报组、黑板报、歌咏传授站等社会文化活动。哈尔滨市在普选、拥军优属等中心工作中，市民业余学校学员组成秧歌队、图片解说组进行宣传。北京市家庭妇女安敏忠经过学习后，在普选中担任小组长、能写汇报提纲。她帮助居民学习时事，组织读报组，很受居民们的欢迎，被居民推选为街道治安委员和妇女委员。许多人学习文化后获得劳动就业的机会，或考入技术学校学习。
   一九五三年各地对扫盲工作进行了整顿，实行了“政府领导、群众自办”的办法，根据群众生活、生产等条件，在群众自愿的原则下，依靠群众的人力、物力有领导地组织群众自己来办学。如西安市在整顿前有群众自办班、组八十五个，学员一千六百多人，整顿后发展为一百八十多个班、组，学员六千多人。石家庄市一九五二年十二月有学员六千二百多人，到一九五三年四月退学近二千人，经过整顿后学员人数增到四千六百二十多人，另外还有许多分散的学习小组。
