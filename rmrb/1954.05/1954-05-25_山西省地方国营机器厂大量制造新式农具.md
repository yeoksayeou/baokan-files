    Shanxi Provincial State-Owned Machine Factory is massively manufacturing new-style farm implements. This year, the Shanxi Machine Factory will trial-produce thirty sets of horse-drawn farm implements (each set including a rocker-arm harvester, a two-wheeled double-furrow plow, a ten-row seeder, and a disc harrow), and plans to complete the manufacturing of ten thousand two-wheeled double-furrow plows before February next year, so that each of the province's ten thousand agricultural producers' cooperatives can have one. In addition, this year the factory also plans to trial-produce one to two 45-horsepower track-type tractors and "Stalin-Six" combined harvesters.

    Machine factories affiliated to various special districts are producing small-scale new-style farm implements based on the different climates and farming habits of the regions. For example, the director and technical personnel of the Linfen Machinery Repair Factory conducted in-depth investigations in rural areas and, based on the needs of local farmers, decided to produce five types, including a five-row seeder. During the trial production, the factory also invited more than three hundred cooperative chairmen and model workers from nearby agricultural producers' cooperatives to visit and provide guidance. The Yuncheng Machinery Repair Factory, based on the local situation of having many deep wells and water scarcity, is massively manufacturing six-zhang deep well waterwheels, greatly inspiring the production enthusiasm of farmers, with many farmers planning to convert dry land into paddy fields. The Xin County Machinery Repair Factory, to meet the needs of local farmers in mountainous areas, is producing improved plowshares suitable for cultivation in mountainous areas (with a planned production of thirty thousand). In mid-May, the Linfen Machinery Repair Factory had already shipped more than five hundred toothed weeding hoes, one hundred and seventy transplanters, and a large number of carts and waterwheels to the vast rural areas of southern Shanxi, to serve the upcoming hoeing and harvesting.

    山西省地方国营机器厂大量制造新式农具
    山西地方国营机器厂正在大量制造新式农具。山西机器厂今年要试制三十套马拉农具（每套包括摇臂收割机、双轮双铧犁、十行播种机、圆盘耙四种），并计划在明年二月前完成一万个双轮双铧犁的制造任务，以便做到全省一万个农业生产合作社每社都能用上一个。此外，今年该厂还计划试制四十五马力链轨式拖拉机和“斯大林——六式”联合收割机一至二部。
    各专署所属机器厂正根据地区气候、耕作习惯的不同，生产小型新式农具。如临汾机械修造厂厂长、技术人员，曾深入农村调查，根据当地农民需要，确定生产五行播种机等五种。在试制中，该厂还请邻近农业生产合作社社长和劳动模范三百多人到厂参观和指导。运城机械修造厂根据当地深井多、用水困难的情况，正大量制造六丈深井水车，大大鼓舞了农民生产情绪，许多农民都计划把旱田改为水田。忻县机械修造厂为适应当地山区农民需要，正在生产适宜山区耕种的改良犁铧（计划生产三万个）。五月中，临汾机械修造厂已把五百多个齿耘锄、一百七十多部移苗机及大批大车、水车源源运往晋南广大农村，为即将开始的锄苗和收割服务。（赵黛娥　于化龙　马登科）
