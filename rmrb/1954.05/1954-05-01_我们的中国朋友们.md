    Our Chinese Friends
    Kang Keskjin, Engineer of the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant in the Soviet Union, Stalin Prize Winner
    Sometimes, when someone you've lived and worked with for years leaves, your impression of that acquaintance also disappears, and you don't feel regret. But there are also completely opposite situations; often, even a brief acquaintance can make you feel like you've found a close friend, with shared interests and a great cause bringing you together intimately. If you part with your new friend, memories of him will linger in your mind forever, and no matter how far apart or how long it's been, it won't affect your remembrance of him. You'll feel pleasantly and warmly that you have a friend, and wherever he is, you'll feel like he's by your side. This is true, joyful friendship.
    Last year, Chinese young interns Lai Jiang, Chen Defang, Mao Shengnong, Jiang Shengming, and Zhang Huaiying (transliterations) came to our factory – the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant – for an internship of several months. The entire time wasn't long. But during these days, all the staff of our factory established close friendly relations with them. We treated these guests from the People's Republic of China as members of our affectionate worker's family.
    Indeed, how could one not like these hardworking and simple comrades! Their every action made people feel that they were doing their utmost to live up to the trust of their great people, who sent them to the Soviet Union to learn methods of socialist industrialization. These young Chinese comrades studied diligently the entire birth process of complex machines one by one, in order to quickly participate in the construction of their motherland's modern electrical machinery manufacturing industry.
    Starting from the drafting board in the design department to the installation of hydraulic generators in the workshop, they not only observed the manufacturing of the machines everywhere but also went directly to the workshop to learn the production process on the spot with more care.
    We saw with admiration how quickly they mastered the creative working methods of our best advanced producers. Comrade Mao Shengnong worked for a period in the slip ring section of the electric motor workshop's Seleznev advanced group. He quickly completed 140 to 150 percent of the production quota and caught up with his teacher, Comrade Seleznev, one of our key personnel.
    From the first day these young experts came to our factory, each of us regarded it as our duty to help them thoroughly learn the experience we had accumulated in designing and producing giant hydraulic generators.
    Under the participation of the factory's main experts – the chief engineer, chief designer, chief technician, and other personnel – individual internship plans for professional technologies were drawn up. An experienced engineer in the relevant industry was assigned to each intern to provide guidance. In the workshops and sections where the Chinese comrades worked, all the workers, foremen, and engineers were willing to contribute their knowledge and practical production experience.
    The vivid, comradely friendship was not limited to production work. Our friends from China stubbornly mastered technical knowledge and fully inherited the glorious traditions of Soviet experts. They were not only determined to become experts in the technical field but also strove to improve their culture and broaden their socio-political horizons.
    At holiday celebrations and evening parties, we happily entertained these envoys of People's China. They were welcome guests everywhere – at production meetings and at the factory's amateur art performances. Every evening and every Sunday they could be encountered at theaters, cinemas, and libraries, holding new books on technology or literature and art in their hands.
    The six-month internship passed quickly. All the pre-arranged plans were completed. These young comrades with theoretical training had also increased their necessary practical knowledge of the production process. Now they have every possibility of becoming skilled leaders in production.
    When bidding farewell to our new friends, Comrade Bugoslavsky, section chief and engineer of the large generator workshop, said: "May the knowledge and experience we have wholeheartedly dedicated help you build new and huge hydroelectric power stations in your motherland more quickly, so that the endless potential of the great Chinese rivers can serve the Chinese people. May the economy of People's China grow and develop rapidly. I wish the unbreakable friendship between the fraternal Soviet and Chinese people will be consolidated day by day."
    All of our hearts were poured into these words.

    我们的中国朋友们
    苏联乌拉尔电机制造厂工程师  斯大林奖金获得者 康·科斯金
    有时，当一个同你生活和工作在一起长达数年之久的人一旦离开了，你对于这个熟人的印象也会与他一同离去，而并不感到惋惜。但是也有完全相反的情形；往往相识并不太久，倒会使你感到如获至友，共同的利益和伟大的事业使你们亲密地结合起来。如果和你的新朋友别离了，对他的回忆将会永远萦绕在你的脑际，无论相离多远，相隔多久，都不能影响你对他的忆念。你会愉快地、亲切地感到，你有着一个朋友，无论他在那里，你总觉得他就在你的身旁。这是真正的欢乐的友情。
    去年，中国的青年实习生赖江、陈德芳、毛盛农、江盛明和张怀英（译音）等同志到我们的工厂——乌拉尔电机制造厂来实习了几个月。整个时间并不长。但是就在这些日子里，我们工厂的全体职工和他们建立了亲密的友谊关系。我们把来自中华人民共和国的客人当作是我们友爱的工人之家的成员。
    的确，怎样能不喜欢这些勤劳朴实的同志呢！他们的一举一动都使人感到，他们竭尽全力以期不辜负派遣他们到苏联来学习社会主义工业化方法的自己的伟大人民的托付。这些年轻的中国同志是如何奋勉地逐一研究了复杂机器的全部诞生过程，以求迅速地参与自己祖国现代化电机制造业的建设工作。
    从设计科的制图版开始到车间内水力发电机的安装止，他们到处都不仅观察机器的制造，而且更用心地直接到车间去实地学习这个制作过程。
    我们以赞赏的心情看到了他们是如何飞速地精通了我们最优秀的先进生产者的创造性的工作方法。毛盛农同志在电机车间聚电环工段的塞列士涅夫先进小组工作了一个时期。他很快就完成了生产定额的百分之一百四十至一百五十，并且赶上了他的老师，我们的骨干之一，塞列士涅夫同志。
    从这些青年专家到我们工厂来的第一天起，我们中间的每一个人都把帮助他们当作自己的职责，使他们能够彻底地学到我们在设计和生产巨型水力发电机方面所积累起来的经验。
    在工厂的主要的专家们——总工程师、总设计师、总技师及其他人员的参与之下，制订了专业技术的个人实习计划。对于每一个实习生都派有一个各该业的有经验的工程师负责指导。在中国同志工作着的车间和工段里，所有的工人、工长和工程师都愿意将自己的知识和实际生产经验贡献出来。
    生动的、同志般的交谊不仅限于生产工作。来自中国的朋友们顽强地掌握了技术知识，并且全面地继承了苏维埃专家的光荣传统。他们不仅决心要在技术领域内变成专家，而且还努力提高文化和扩大社会政治眼界。
    在节日的庆祝会和晚会上，我们愉快地招待着那些人民中国的使者们。在生产会议上，在工厂的业余艺术表演会上，他们到处都是受欢迎的客人。每天晚上和每个星期日都可能在剧院、电影院和图书馆里遇到他们，看到他们的手里拿着有关技术的或者是文学艺术的新书。
    半年的实习时间很快就过去了。全部预订的计划都完成了。这些具有理论修养的青年同志们，又增加了有关生产过程的许多必需的实际知识。现在他们已有一切可能成为生产上的熟练的领导人了。
    在送别我们的新朋友的时候，大型发电机车间工段长、工程师布果斯拉夫斯基同志说道：“愿我们所全心全意献出来的知识和经验帮助你们更快地在你们的祖国建立起新的巨大的水力发电站来，以使伟大的中国江河的无穷无尽的潜力服务于中国人民。愿人民中国的经济迅速地成长和发展起来。祝兄弟般的苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊日益巩固。”
    我们全体的心意都倾注在这些话语里。
