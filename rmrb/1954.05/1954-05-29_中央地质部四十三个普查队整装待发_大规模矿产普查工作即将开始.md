    [Report from this newspaper] The Central Geological Department, in order to continuously open up new exploration areas and meet the country's current and long-term construction needs, has organized forty-three prospecting teams, preparing to depart in early June for more than eighty regions from Zhejiang and Fujian in the east to Sichuan and Xikang in the west to carry out mineral prospecting work.

    The main tasks of this year's mineral prospecting work are to find new iron ore in the Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions; to systematically carry out prospecting of large coalfields in the Central South, North China and other places, and to expand the prospecting of coal for power to meet the needs of the growing heavy industry and transportation; and to widely carry out prospecting for mineral resources such as copper, lead, zinc, manganese, chromium, and nickel. In addition to some core personnel drawn from the geological departments, the prospecting teams are mainly composed of a large number of new geological forces from graduating students of geological colleges and geology departments of various universities; professors, lecturers, assistants, etc. from relevant colleges and universities will also participate in the joint organization and leadership. Therefore, this large-scale mineral prospecting work will not only continue to change the face of geological work in China, but will also enable teachers and students of geological colleges and universities to more closely integrate theory with practice, which will undoubtedly become a good beginning for close cooperation between geological education departments and production departments.

    In order to successfully complete this year's mineral prospecting tasks, the Central Geological Department held a prospecting work conference, inviting representatives from relevant industrial departments, colleges and universities, and the major regional financial and economic committees to jointly study and determine the specific areas and projects for prospecting. The conference studied the scientific theories and advanced experiences of Soviet prospecting work, clarified the long-term and comprehensive nature of prospecting work; and determined that this year's prospecting work will be carried out in three forms: the first is to expand the prospecting in the peripheral areas of existing exploration teams, which will be directly led by the existing exploration teams to systematically carry out prospecting work; the second is to establish prospecting brigades (prospecting stations) in the most promising areas to carry out long-term and comprehensive prospecting work; the third is to conduct inspection and re-examination work on some known mineral deposits that have not yet determined prospects, and then decide on future deployment based on the prospecting situation.

    中央地质部四十三个普查队整装待发
    大规模矿产普查工作即将开始
   【本报讯】中央地质部为不断开辟新的勘探地区，满足国家当前和长远的建设需要，已组织四十三个普查工作队，准备在六月上旬出发到东起浙闽，西到川康的八十多个地区进行矿产普查工作。
    今年矿产普查工作的主要任务是在中南、西南、西北三个地区寻找新的铁矿；开始有系统地在中南、华北等地进行大煤田的普查和扩大对动力用煤的普查，以满足日益发展的重工业和交通运输业的需要；广泛地开展对铜、铅、锌、锰、铬、镍等矿产资源的普查。普查工作队，除由地质部门抽调部分骨干以外，主要由各地质学院、各大学地质系应届毕业的大批新生的地质力量组成；各有关院校的教授、讲师、助教等也将参加共同组织领导。因此，这次规模巨大的矿产普查工作，不但将继续改变我国地质工作的面貌，同时也将使各地质院校师生把理论与实践更加密切结合起来，无疑将成为地质教育部门和生产部门密切合作的一个良好的开端。
    为了胜利地完成今年的矿产普查任务，中央地质部曾召开了一次普查工作会议，邀请各有关工业部门、院校和大区财政经济委员会的代表，共同研究确定了普查的具体地区与项目。会议学习了苏联普查工作的科学理论和先进经验，明确了普查工作的长期性和综合性；确定了今年普查工作分三种形式：第一种是扩大现有勘探队外围地区的普查，由现有勘探队直接领导，系统地开展普查工作；第二种是在最有远景的地区建立普查大队（普查站），进行长期的综合的普查找矿工作；第三种是就一些已知的但又未能确定远景的矿产地，先做检查复查工作，视普查情况再决定今后部署。
