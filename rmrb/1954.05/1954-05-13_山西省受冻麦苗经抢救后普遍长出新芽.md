    Rescued Wheat Seedlings in Shanxi Province Universally Sprout New Buds
    After processing and rescue efforts, frozen wheat seedlings in Shanxi Province have universally sprouted new buds. After parts of Shanxi Province suffered frost damage to wheat on April 19th and 20th, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government immediately issued urgent instructions, requiring all localities to mobilize the masses to carry out rapid rescue operations. At the same time, comfort groups were organized to visit disaster areas to express sympathy to the affected masses and assist in the rescue. Leadership organs at the special district and county levels also successively dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the disaster areas to mobilize the masses to carry out irrigation, topdressing, weeding and other rescue work. Now most of the affected wheat seedlings have recovered. In Linfen Special District, where the wheat fields suffered lighter frost damage, the original tillers still account for 20% to 30%, and new tillers are also developing. The most severely frozen wheat seedlings, although all the leaves have died, are growing new buds. In soils with stronger fertility, the new wheat seedlings have grown to more than a foot high, and the new buds on soils with weaker fertility have also reached about three inches. Farmers in the frost-stricken areas of Wenxi, Xiaxian, Xinjiang and other places in Yuncheng Special District have actively carried out rescue work. Wheat seedlings that suffered lighter frost damage have returned to normal growth, and those that suffered heavier frost damage have also sprouted new buds after rescue. More than 70,000 mu of irrigated wheat fields in Wenxi County have been watered, and many areas have also been topdressed. In Jincheng, Yangcheng and other seven counties of Changzhi Special District, 100,000 mu of affected wheat seedlings have been hoed once and are growing normally. At present, farmers in various frost-stricken areas are still actively watering, weeding, and applying topdressing to ensure that the affected wheat seedlings do not miss their growth period and to ensure the completion of the wheat production increase task.

    山西省受冻麦苗经抢救后普遍长出新芽
    山西受冻麦苗经加工抢救后，已普遍长出新芽。四月十九、二十两日，山西部分地区小麦遭到霜灾后，中共山西省委、山西省人民政府曾立即发出紧急指示，要求各地动员群众迅速进行抢救，同时组织慰问团，赴灾区慰问受灾群众，并帮助抢救。各专区、和县领导机关，也先后抽出大批干部深入灾区，发动群众进行灌溉、追肥、除草等抢救工作。现在受灾麦苗已大部恢复。临汾专区麦田受冻较轻的，原分蘖仍有百分之二十至三十，新分蘖也正在发展。受冻最重的麦苗，叶部虽全部死掉，但新芽又在生长。地力较强的土壤，新的麦苗已生长一尺多高，地力较弱的土壤上的新芽，也达三寸左右。运城专区闻喜、夏县、新绛等地冻灾区农民经积极抢救后，受冻较轻的麦苗已恢复正常生长，受冻较重的，经抢救后也株株生出新芽。闻喜县七万多亩水地麦田，已浇过百分之七十以上，还有不少地区施了追肥。长治专区晋城、阳城等七县十万亩受灾麦苗，已锄过一遍，生长正常。目前各受冻灾地区的农民，仍在积极浇水、锄草、施追肥，以使受灾麦苗不误生长，保证完成小麦增产任务。
