    Henan Farmers Actively Prepare for Summer Harvest and Planting
    Farmers in Henan Province are actively preparing for the summer harvest and planting. In the warmer southern counties of Huangchuan, Nanyang, and Xichuan, wheat has already begun to be harvested. This year, due to the large number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province leading mutual aid teams and individual farmers, preparations for the summer harvest and planting have been more timely and thorough than in previous years.
    In mid-May, the Fifth District of Xiangcheng County convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders, which prominently resolved difficult issues such as how to arrange farm work according to plan and how to evaluate and record work points during the summer harvest and planting. In order to summarize and exchange experience in high-yield wheat production and to arrange wheat seed selection work, the special districts of Xinxiang, Luoyang, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, and Nanyang successively held meetings in mid-May to conduct visits and comparisons. Supply and marketing departments in various regions also attached great importance to the timely supply of agricultural tools for the summer harvest and planting this year. Farmers in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, seeing the promising wheat harvest, are actively preparing farm tools. At the ten ancient temple fairs and material exchange meetings in the district in mid-May, supply and marketing cooperatives supplied more than 20,800 pieces of agricultural tools such as mulberry forks, sickles, small shovels, and hoe blades. Using the 330 million yuan in advance payments for agricultural products from the state, 74 agricultural producers' cooperatives and 1,911 mutual aid teams in eight counties of Xinxiang Special District, including Yanjin and Xiuwu, bought back various agricultural tools and fertilizers to prepare for the summer harvest and planting. The wheat cultivated and planted by the state agricultural machinery tractor stations for the Ling Heine and Gao Yumei agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Yellow River flooded area and the Shazhuang agricultural producers' cooperative in Bo'ai County is better than ever before. Now the members have organized their labor force and are preparing to use automatic harvesters to harvest. In addition, the wheat in state-run farms across the province is growing very well this year. This year, 60 local state-run farms will use horse-drawn harvesters to harvest wheat. (Lǚ Jianzhong)

    河南省农民积极准备夏收夏种
    河南省农民积极准备夏收夏种。南部气候温暖的潢川、南阳、淅川等县，小麦已开始收割。今年由于全省有了大量的农业生产合作社带动着互助组和单干农民，对夏收夏种的准备工作都比往年做得及时而充分。
    襄城县五区五月中旬召开互助组长代表会，突出地解决了夏收夏种中怎样按照计划安排农活和评工记分等困难问题。为了总结、交流小麦丰产经验和布置小麦选种工作，新乡、洛阳、许昌、郑州、南阳等专区都于五月中旬先后召开了会议，进行参观评比。各地供销部门今年对及时供应农民夏收夏种农具也很重视。郑州市郊区农民看到麦子丰收在望，纷纷准备农具。在五月中旬全区的十个古庙会和物资交流会上，供销社供应了桑杈、镰刀、小铲、锄板等农具两万零八百多件。新乡专区延津、修武等八个县的七十四个农业生产合作社和一千九百一十一个互助组，用国家预购农产品定金三亿三千万元，买回了各种农具和肥料，准备夏收夏种。黄泛区凌黑妮、高玉梅农业生产合作社和博爱县莎庄农业生产合作社，今年由国家农业机器拖拉机站代耕代种的小麦，是从来未有的好麦子。现在社员们已把劳力组织好了，准备自动收割机去收割。此外，今年全省各地农场的小麦都长得非常好，今年有六十个地方国营农场用马拉收割机收割小麦。（吕建中）
