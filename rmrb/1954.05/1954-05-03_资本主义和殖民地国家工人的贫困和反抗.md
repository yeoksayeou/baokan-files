Poverty and Resistance of Workers in Capitalist and Colonial Countries

    American Workers Oppose McCarthy
    According to the U.S. "Worker's Daily" of February 28th: On the eve of wage negotiations between General Electric and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), McCarthy, at the behest of the bosses of General Electric, came to Albany, New York, and suddenly subpoenaed fourteen outstanding union cadres from Local 301 of the General Electric Schenectady plant. This political conspiracy by the monopoly capitalists immediately aroused the anger of hundreds of thousands of workers. Workers from the General Electric Schenectady plant, as well as workers from the General Electric Rome plant 125 miles away, the Ilmira plant 170 miles away, and the New York plant 150 miles away, rushed to the courthouse in Albany to cheer and pay tribute to their own leaders (the fourteen persecuted union cadres), to embrace the witnesses testifying for the fourteen, and to distribute signed petitions reading "McCarthyism is a Betrayal of America," protesting McCarthy's political persecution. They vowed to fight resolutely against McCarthy, the FBI, and General Electric to the very end.

    Great Britain "Facing a Wave of Strikes"
    According to the magazine "World Trade Union Movement," No. 5, 1954: For several months, the struggle of British workers to increase wages has become the top news story in the newspapers. The strike of 30,000 electrical installation workers, in particular, has attracted much attention.
    These 30,000 electrical installation workers are members of the Electrical Trades Union, which has 212,000 members. The Electrical Trades Union announced a "guerrilla war" style strike movement to support their demands in order to take full advantage of their dispersed strength.
    On February 16th, 7,000 electrical workers in the London area once again held a 24-hour strike to protest the unreasonable behavior of the employers in refusing to increase wages. On the same day, 10,000 electrical installation workers held a parade. It is said to be the largest demonstration of British electrical workers since World War II.
    In a commentary on the British strike movement in this year's second issue of "In Defence of Peace," George Gorvie said: The continuous strike movement of British workers has "shaken the entire British nation" and "caused Labor Minister Sir Walter Monckton to shudder." When you talk to a middle-class Briton about the British economic situation, he will shake his head and say to you: "We are facing a wave of strikes..."

    Japanese Workers Demand Wage Increases
    On December 5th of last year, 35,000 members of 50 Japanese trade union units gathered in Tokyo to demand year-end bonuses and wage increases. After the meeting, the workers paraded, holding up large banners with slogans such as "Demand Year-End Bonuses," "Oppose Japanese Rearmament," and "Oppose U.S. 'Aid.'" This photograph shows the scene of the Japanese workers' demonstration at that time.

    American Paupers Commit Suicide
    Recently, in the wave of unemployment in the United States, the phenomenon of suicide has also increased. In a cotton-growing area of ​​Caruthersville, Missouri, "6,000 to 8,000 people have lost any hope of finding work," and they "have not had a piece of bread for two or three days" (TASS New York, February 11). In February, New York newspapers reported three suicide cases in four days: on February 2nd, sailor Stuart committed suicide; on the 4th, a 58-year-old widow, Fecaro, jumped off a building in a Brooklyn slum; and on the 5th, a 60-year-old poor worker, Robinson, committed suicide. The cause of these deaths was poverty; some not only did not have enough to eat but could not even find a place to live.

    "Home" of Unemployed American Workers
    Not long ago, the United Steelworkers of America’s newspaper "Steel Labor" published this photo: On the streets of Detroit, USA,
  an eight-member family of unemployed worker James Craver, James, his wife Elizabeth, and six children ranging in age from two to fifteen, live in a dilapidated coffin car.
    James was originally a grinding worker in a factory in Detroit. He lost his job last September. He had no choice but to take his family to wander the streets and set up "home" in this broken car.
    During the day, James goes out to look for work, and Elizabeth takes care of the children. At night, they let the children sleep on two mattresses spread out in the car compartment, and he and his wife take turns looking after them.

    Poverty of Colombian Workers
    The Colombian magazine "El Tiempo" published an article describing the life of workers in a working-class district of the capital Bogotá, the Claret district: "The houses in this district are simple huts made by the residents themselves from materials such as stones, tin cans, and old wooden boards." "In the Claret district, people can see car after car of water tanks and row after row of people" standing "waiting for a little ration of water. They have to wait a whole day for this little bit of water." There, "many workers do not earn enough money to support their families," "the children are all skinny and sick," and in the area where 12,000 workers live, if someone gets sick, there is nothing they can do but let them live or die because there is "no hospital where patients can get first aid."

    How Algerian Dockworkers Live
    What is the life of dockworkers in Algeria, a French colony? A letter from Lou Chachi, an Algerian youth dockworker, published in the fourth issue of "World Youth" this year, answers this question.
    Chachi's letter says: We often "carry goods weighing up to 200 pounds in one breath to places 40 to 80 yards away, working continuously for six hours a day without any rest." "In winter, we often have to transport dates non-stop all night long. We do not have enough clothes to keep out the cold. After a night, people are frozen stiff; and the bags of goods raise choking dust." Heavy labor and hunger make the number of people suffering from tuberculosis among them shockingly high, and 60 percent of these patients are incurable.
    Accidents often happen on the docks. In his letter, Chachi told such a tragic story: "The ropes used to unload goods from the ship were so worn out because they had been used for too long that they were almost as thin as a thread. One day, the rope suddenly broke, and twelve packages, each weighing 200 pounds, rolled down from a high place and crushed to death a dockworker named Chitar Alakua. He left behind his elderly mother, two younger brothers, and a younger sister who had no one to support them."
    In his letter, Chachi talked about their living conditions: "If you only earn 782 francs a day, and 500 of them have to be spent on buying bread and a few ounces of fish... In addition, you have to spend 150 francs to get a place to stay overnight in a hostel for single men..."
    "Why do we live in poverty?" Chachi asked in his letter, and then said painfully: "There are hundreds of thousands of children in our country starving, but we are forced to transport bags of wheat to ships heading to the United States." "But," Chachi said, "we can learn from the examples of our worker brothers in Algiers and Oran. In 1951, a powerful strike broke out in Oran, where the dockworkers persisted for a whole month. As a result, wages increased by 15 percent. They refused to ship weapons to Vietnam to wage war against the Vietnamese people, our brothers." (Attached image)

    资本主义和殖民地国家工人的贫困和反抗
    美国工人反对麦卡锡
    据二月二十八日美国“工人日报”消息：在通用电气公司和联合电气、无线电及机械工人工会进行工资谈判的前夕，麦卡锡应通用电气公司老板之命来到纽约州的奥尔巴尼市，突然传讯了通用电气公司舒湼塔地厂三○一区工会十四名卓越的工会干部。垄断资本家这一政治阴谋，立即激起成千上万工人们的愤怒。通用电气公司舒湼塔地厂的工人们以及一百二十五哩外的通用电气公司罗马厂的工人、一百七十哩外的伊尔米拉厂的工人和一百五十哩外的纽约厂的工人们，纷纷赶到奥尔巴尼市的法庭上，向他们自己的领袖（被迫害的十四个工会干部）欢呼致敬，拥抱为这十四人作证的证人，并散发上面写着“麦卡锡主义是对美国的叛卖”的签名书，抗议麦卡锡的政治迫害，他们发誓要同麦卡锡、联邦调查局和通用电气公司坚决斗争到底。英国“面临罢工浪潮”
    据一九五四年第五期“世界工会运动”杂志报道：几个月来，英国工人的争取增加工资的斗争已成为各报的头号新闻。斗争激烈的三万名电气安装工人的罢工特别引人注意。
    这三万名电气安装工人是拥有二十一万二千名会员的英国电气工会的会员。电气工会宣布发动一个“游击战”式的罢工运动来支持他们的要求，以便充分利用分散的力量。
    二月十六日，伦敦地区的七千名电气工人再一次举行了二十四小时的罢工，抗议资方不增加工资的无理行为。当天并有一万名电气安装工人举行了游行示威。据说规模是第二次世界大战以后英国电气工人最大的一次示威游行。
    乔治·郭维在今年第二号“保卫和平”杂志上评论英国罢工运动时说：英国工人接连不断的罢工运动，已使“整个英国人心震荡”，“劳工大臣蒙克顿爵士，浑身寒战”，当你和中产阶级的英国人谈到英国经济状况时，他会摇头向你说：“我们正面临罢工浪潮……”。日本工人要求增加工资
    去年十二月五日，五十个日本工会单位的会员三万五千人，为了要求发给年终津贴和增加工资在东京集会，会后工人们高举着“要求发给年终津贴”、“反对日本重新武装”和“反对美国‘援助’”等大字标语游行。这张照片就是当时日本工人们游行示威的情形。
    美国贫民自杀
    近来，在美国的失业浪潮中，自杀的现象也在增加了。在密苏里州卡鲁特斯维尔一个植棉区中，有“六千到八千人失去了任何找到工作的希望”，他们“两三天没有得到一片面包”（塔斯社纽约二月十一日电）。二月份的纽约报纸在四天内接连报道了三宗自杀案件：二月二日海员斯图特自杀，四日在布鲁克林贫民窟里五十八岁的寡妇费卡罗跳楼自杀，五日，六十岁的贫苦工人罗宾逊自杀。这些死者自杀的原因，都是因为贫穷造成的，他们有的不但吃不饱饭，连个栖身的地方都找不到。
      美国失业工人的“家”
    不久前，美国产业工会联合会机关报“产业新闻”上刊登了这样一张照片：在美国底特律市街头
  一辆破旧不堪的装棺材用的汽车里，住着失业工人詹姆斯·克拉佛的八口之家：詹姆斯和他的妻子伊丽莎白以及六个由两岁到十五岁的孩子。
    詹姆斯原是底特律一家工厂中的研磨工人，去年九月里失业了，他只好带着全家人流浪街头，把“家”安在这辆破汽车里。
    白天，詹姆斯出去找工作，伊丽莎白照拂孩子们。晚上，就让孩子们睡在铺在车厢里的两个褥垫上，他两人轮流照拂他们。哥伦比亚工人的贫困哥伦比亚“时代报”杂志刊载了一篇文章，叙述首都波哥大一个工人区——克拉雷特区的工人生活说：“这个区的房子是居民自己用石头、罐头皮、旧木板之类的材料做成的简陋的小屋”，“在克拉雷特区，人们在中央广场可以看到一车一车的水箱和一排一排的人”，许多人站着“在等待一点配给水。就是这一点水，他们得等一整天”。那里“许多工人挣得的钱不够维持他们的家庭”，“孩子们都是骨瘦如柴，病容满面”，在那一万二千个工人生活的区域里，有人生了病，一点办法也没有，只好听其自生自灭，因为那里“没有一个使病人能得到急救的医院。”
      阿尔及利亚码头工人是怎样生活的
    法国的殖民地阿尔及利亚的码头工人是怎样生活的呢？今年第四期“世界青年”杂志上刊登的阿尔及利亚青年码头工人卢·沙西的一封信回答了这个问题。
    沙西的信里说：我们常常“把重达两百斤的货物一口气搬到四十至八十码以外的地方去，一天接连干六小时，一点休息都没有。”“冬季，我们时常要整夜不息地搬运枣子。我们没有足够御寒的衣服，经过一夜，人都冻僵了；而搬运的货袋又扬起一股令人窒息的灰尘。”沉重的劳动和饥寒交迫使他们中间患肺结核病的人多得惊人，而且这些患者中有百分之六十是不能治愈的。
    码头上常常发生事故。沙西在信里讲了这样一个悲惨的故事：“船上起货的绳子因为用得太久，磨损得简直只有一根线那么粗了，有一天绳子突然断了，于是十二包各重两百斤的货物从高处滚下来，压死了一个名叫契塔尔·阿拉库亚的码头工人。他留下年老的母亲、两个小弟弟和一个小妹妹无人供养。”
    沙西在信中谈到他们的生活情况：“如果你每天只挣得七百八十二个法郎，而其中的五百个就得花在买面包和几两鱼上面……此外，你还得花一百五十个法郎到单身汉住的客栈里去弄个地方过夜。……”
      “为什么我们会过着穷困的生活呢？”沙西在信里一面这样问一面又痛心地说：“我们国内有成千上万的儿童在忍饥挨饿，而我们却被迫把麦子一袋一袋地运到开往美国的船上去。”“但是，”沙西说，“我们能够从阿尔及尔和阿兰的工人兄弟们的范例中吸取经验。一九五一年，阿兰爆发了强大的罢工，那里的码头工人坚持了整整一个月。结果工资增加了百分之十五。他们拒绝装运武器到越南去进行反对越南人民——我们的弟兄们的战争”。（附图片）
    伦敦电气安装工人要求增加工资，这是他们游行示威的情形。
