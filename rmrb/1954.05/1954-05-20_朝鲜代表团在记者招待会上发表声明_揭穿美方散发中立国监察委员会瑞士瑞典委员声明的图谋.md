Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 19th: On May 18th, the spokesman of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea delegation issued the following statement at a press conference:

The Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), in their statement to the Military Armistice Commission on May 7th, made unfounded and libelous attacks against our side and raised unfair demands. On May 17th, ten days later, the US delegation distributed this statement to everyone at the "House of Journalists" in Geneva. Before discussing the content of this statement, I want you to know an important fact. On April 20th, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held its 41st meeting.

At this meeting, the US Chief Commissioner, Lacey, as in the past, attempted to create instability in the Korean armistice. In addition, he made shameless slanders and smears against the Czech and Polish members of the NNSC and put forward opinions that threatened the future of the NNSC. The statement you received yesterday was published after Lacey made these remarks.

Without further explanation, this is clearly out of a plan that is detrimental to the Geneva Conference.

As for the statement of the Swiss and Swedish members of the NNSC, I think it is necessary to clarify the rights and wrongs of the matter.

In the first part of the statement, the Swiss and Swedish members attempted to prove that the US side strictly abided by the armistice agreement and fully guaranteed that the neutral inspection teams could carry out all their work without hindrance.

Since the signing of the armistice agreement until today, the United Nations Command (UNC) side has not complied with the provisions of Paragraph 13(c), Paragraph 13(d), and Paragraph 28 of the armistice agreement.

In order to cover up the fact that the UNC side seriously violated the armistice agreement by illegally transporting more and more war materials and military aircraft, the Swiss and Swedish members of the NNSC insisted that the neutral inspection teams could conduct free inspections in the south, but the fact is not at all like that.

The report submitted by the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC to the Military Armistice Commission on April 30th clearly listed some facts. The report fully proved that the UNC side had been violating the armistice agreement for a long time, constantly increasing its armed forces, and that the neutral inspection teams were unable to conduct effective inspections in South Korea due to various restrictions and obstructions from the UNC side.

The NNSC acknowledged that inspection teams must conduct effective inspections and supervisions on ships. Therefore, the Commission issued such instructions to the inspection teams.

However, the UNC side, in its letter of October 6, 1953, prohibited the neutral inspection teams from going to the ships in the ports of its military control areas.

Therefore, the neutral inspection teams cannot effectively carry out the work of inspecting replacements as they were supposed to do.

In Pusan and Inchon, the neutral inspection teams were refused permission to open boxes for inspection.

On January 20, 1954, a serious incident restricting the activities of the inspection teams occurred in Inchon.

The UNC side issued an order to the neutral inspection teams: "On the afternoon of January 20th and the morning of January 21st, the neutral inspection teams shall not conduct inspections in the port."

You may remember what happened in Inchon Port that day. On that day, more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war were illegally abducted from Dongchang-ri in the demilitarized zone and forcibly put on US landing craft and transported to Taiwan.

In order to restrict and obstruct the work of the neutral inspection teams, the UNC side even insulted, intimidated, beat, and kidnapped members of the neutral inspection teams.

The world knows that the open kidnapping of Polish staff member Hadukiewicz took place in Kangnung.

The real intention of the UNC side in publishing the statement of the Swiss and Swedish members of the NNSC is self-evident. On the surface, it seems to be for the inspection teams to freely carry out their work, but in reality, it obstructs the work of the inspection teams.

It is sufficient to illustrate this by citing the following examples. As of the end of March 1954, the UNC side had transported ninety-seven more combat aircraft to Korea than it had transported out. They refused to provide any reports on certain aircraft that the UNC side said were not for combat and aircraft that had been transported out of Korea. Therefore, as of April 15, 1954, 177 aircraft had been illegally transported into Korea. The UNC side illegally transported parts of various weapons into Korea as of the end of February 1954 and refused the inspection teams to inspect them. These parts could be used to assemble at least 465 cannons and mortars, 1,365 machine guns, 6,400 anti-tank guns, and 145 rifles. In addition to the above, there are countless similar examples.

Paragraph 13(e) of the armistice agreement stipulates that both sides shall give full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its inspection teams in the performance of their duties and tasks.

Paragraph 13(f) stipulates that both sides shall guarantee to all members and other personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission the freedom and facilities necessary for the proper performance of their duties.

Paragraph 43 stipulates that the neutral inspection teams stationed in the designated ports shall enjoy full passage facilities in the areas and transportation routes designated in the armistice agreement.

Paragraph 17 stipulates that the commanders on both sides of the hostile parties shall actively cooperate with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to comply with all the provisions of the armistice agreement, both in letter and in spirit.

The various restrictions and obstacles imposed by the UNC side on the work of the neutral inspection teams seriously violated the above-mentioned clauses of the armistice agreement.

No one can find any reason to deny this fact.

The UNC side, in an attempt to divert public opinion and thus cover up their violations of the agreement in South Korea, said that the activities of the neutral inspection teams in North Korea were apparently not adequately guaranteed and that the responsibility lay with the Korean-Chinese side and the Czechoslovak and Polish members who exercised their veto power.

The Swiss and Swedish members of the NNSC wrote in their statement: "...but in the areas under military control of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the inspection teams used their 'veto' power to reduce the control work of the checkpoints to a minimum."

But what is the truth of the matter?

In order to investigate the serious violations of the agreement that occurred in Inchon on January 20th and 21st, a request should have been made to send a mobile neutral inspection team to the site, but the Swiss and Swedish members of the commission, under pressure from the United States, refused to raise this request at the NNSC meeting.

If the activities of the neutral inspection teams in the northern ports are restricted, then why can't they cite any specific examples?

It is precisely in the northern region that they can conduct inspections without any restrictions or obstacles.

They cannot even cite an example that is sufficient to refute these specific facts.

In the last part of their statement, the Swiss and Swedish members of the NNSC suggested that the three ports of Chongjin, Hungnam, and Sinanju, which are clearly stipulated in the armistice agreement, should be transferred to other places, and they groundlessly insisted that there was no legitimate reason to continue to retain these three ports.

Since the armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that we do not intend to use these ports for replacement and rotation.

Although we have firmly stated that since our side does not intend to transport any military supplies, there is no need to designate Chongjin, Hungnam, and Sinanju as ports, the US side still insisted on designating these three places as ports. Therefore, it is quite natural that no replacement and rotation has been carried out through the above-mentioned three ports.

Based on what I have said above, I cannot but draw the following conclusion: the purpose of the US statement is due to the US conspiracy to delay the solution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and to have an adverse impact on the solution of the Indochina issue.

### 朝鲜代表团在记者招待会上发表声明  揭穿美方散发中立国监察委员会瑞士瑞典委员声明的图谋

    朝鲜代表团在记者招待会上发表声明
    揭穿美方散发中立国监察委员会瑞士瑞典委员声明的图谋
    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】五月十八日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团发言人在记者招待会上发表下列声明：
    中立国监察委员会的瑞士委员和瑞典委员在五月七日向军事停战委员会所作的声明中对我方进行了毫无根据的诬蔑性的攻击，并对我方提出了不公正的要求。五月十七日，即经过十天以后，美国代表团在日内瓦“记者之家”向各位散发了这一声明。在谈到这一声明的内容以前，我希望各位知道一个重要的事实。四月二十日，朝鲜军事停战委员会举行了第四十一次会议。
    在这次会上，美方首席委员拉西像以往一样，企图制造朝鲜停战的不稳定状态。此外，他对中立国监察委员会的捷、波两国委员进行了无耻的诽谤和诬蔑，并提出了威胁到中立国监察委员会的前途的意见。你们昨天所得到的声明是在拉西发表了这些意见后公布的。
    不用再加解释，这显然是出于某种使日内瓦会议遭到不利影响的计划。
    至于谈到中立国监察委员会瑞士委员和瑞典委员的声明，我认为有必要澄清事情的是非。
    在该项声明的第一部分中，瑞士委员和瑞典委员企图证明：美方严格遵守了停战协定，并且完全保证了让中立国视察小组无阻挠地进行一切工作。
    自停战协定签订后直到今天，联合国军方面一直没有遵守停战协定第十三款丑项，第十三款卯项和第二十八款的规定。
    为了掩饰联合国军方面严重地破坏停战协定，非法运入越来越多的作战物资和军用飞机这一事实，中立国监察委员会的瑞士委员和瑞典委员硬说，中立国视察小组能够在南部自由进行视察活动，但事实却完全不是这样。
    中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员在四月三十日向军事停战委员会提出的报告清楚地列举了一些事实。报告充分地证明：联合国军方面长期以来一直在破坏停战协定，不断地增加武装部队，并且，由于联合国军方面的各种限制与阻挠，中立国视察小组无法在南朝鲜进行有效的视察。
    中立国监察委员会承认，视察小组必须到船上进行有效的视察和监察。因此，委员会向视察小组发出了这种指示。
    但是，联合国军方面在它一九五三年十月六日的信件中禁止中立国视察小组到它的军事控制地区的港口的船只上去。
    因此，中立国视察小组不能有效地进行它们所担当的视察替换情况的工作。
    在釜山和仁川，中立国视察小组被拒绝开箱检查。
    一九五四年一月二十日，在仁川发生了限制视察小组的活动的严重事件。
    联合国军方面对中立国视察小组发出命令：“在一月二十日下午和一月二十一日上午，中立国视察小组不得在港口进行视察。”
    你们也许记得，那一天在仁川港发生的事情。就在那一天，有一万四千余名中国人民志愿军战俘被非法地由非军事区的东场里劫走，并用武力押上美国的登陆艇运往台湾。
    联合国军方面为了限制和阻挠中立国视察小组进行工作，甚至于侮辱、恫吓、殴打和绑架中立国视察小组的人员。
    全世界都知道，在江陵就发生了公然绑架波兰工作人员哈都克耶维赤的事件。
    联合国军方面公布中立国监察委员会瑞士委员和瑞典委员的声明的真正用意何在，不言自明，表面上似乎是为了视察小组能自由地执行它的工作，而实际上它却以此阻挠视察小组的工作。
    只要举出下列一些例子就足够说明这一点了。截至一九五四年三月底，联合国军方面运往朝鲜的作战飞机就比运出去的多九十七架。关于某些据联合国军方面所说不是作战用的飞机，和曾经运出朝鲜的飞机，他们拒绝提供任何报告。因此，截至一九五四年四月十五日为止，非法运入朝鲜的飞机就达一百七十七架。联合国军方面截至一九五四年二月底非法运入各种武器的零件，并拒绝视察小组进行视察，用这些零件至少能装配大炮与迫击炮四百六十五门、机关枪一千三百六十五挺、反坦克枪六千四百枝、步枪一百四十五枝。除开上面所指出的外，类似的例子是不胜枚举的。
    停战协定第十三款午项规定，双方在中立国监察委员会及其视察小组执行其职司与任务时应给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作。
    同款酉项又规定，双方应保证中立国监察委员会的所有委员及其他人员均享有为适当执行其职司所必需的自由与便利。
    第四十三款规定，设立在指定的口岸的中立国视察小组在停战协定所指定的地区及交通通道上应享有充分的通行便利。
    第十七款规定：敌对双方司令官须与中立国监察委员会积极合作，以求得对本停战协定全部规定的文字与精神的遵守。
    联合国军方面对中立国视察小组的工作所加的各种限制与障碍都严重地破坏了停战协定的上述条款。
    没有人能找出任何理由来否认这一事实。
    联合国军方面企图转移舆论的注意，从而掩饰他们在南朝鲜破坏协议的行为，竟说中立国视察小组在朝鲜北部的活动仿佛没有得到应有的保证，仿佛责任在于朝中方面以及行使否决权的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员似的。
    中立国监察委员会的瑞士委员和瑞典委员在他们的声明中写道：“……但是在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军实行军事管制的地区，视察小组的捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员利用自己的‘否决’权使得检查站的管制工作几乎减少到最低限度。”
    但事实的经过究竟怎样呢？
    为了调查一月二十日和二十一日曾在仁川发生的严重破坏协定的事件，应该要求派遣机动中立国视察小组前往该地，但是委员会的瑞士委员和瑞典委员在美国的压力下拒绝在中立国监察委员会会议上提出这一要求。
    如果中立国视察小组在北部各口岸的活动受到限制的话，那末他们为什么举不出任何具体事例来呢？
    正是在北部地区，他们可以不受任何限制和阻碍地进行视察。
    他们甚至举不出一个足以驳斥这些具体事实的例子来。
    中立国监察委员会的瑞士和瑞典委员在他们的声明的最后一部分，建议把停战协定所明确规定的口岸中的清津、兴南和新安州三个口岸转换到别的地方去，他们毫无根据地硬说没有任何正当的理由继续保留这三个口岸。
    从停战谈判的时候起，朝中方面曾一再指出，我们不打算利用这些口岸来进行替换和轮换。
    尽管我们曾坚决表示，由于我方不准备运入任何军事物资，因此，没有必要将清津、兴南和新安州定为口岸，但是美方仍然坚持要将这三个地方定为口岸。因此，未曾经由上述三个口岸进行过替换和轮换，是十分自然的。
    根据我以上所述，我不能不作出下列结论：美国的声明的目的是由于美国阴谋拖延朝鲜问题在日内瓦外长会议上的解决并对印度支那问题的解决产生不利的影响。
