Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 25th:

At the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, Mátyás Rákosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, delivered a report on the summary of the work of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the tasks of the Hungarian Working People's Party on the 24th.

Rakosi said: It will soon be ten years since the glorious Soviet army entered Hungary and liberated our motherland. It will also soon be ten years since the establishment of the Provisional National Assembly and the Provisional National Government, which enabled the Hungarian state to be revived. Our motherland has been free for ten years.

If we look back at the period since the liberation of Hungary, it can be seen that in our thousand-year history, our people have never experienced such profound economic, social, political, and cultural changes as in these ten years.

Rakosi said that in the entire decade, the economic system of our motherland has undergone fundamental changes, our economic structure has completely changed, and our mode of production and production relations have changed. The socialist mode of production is the only dominant system in industry, transportation, trade, and banking. The class structure of Hungarian society has also fundamentally changed, and the classes themselves and the relations between them have also changed. The landlord and large landowner class has been eliminated. In Hungary, the industrial bourgeoisie no longer exists as a class. Now, in Hungary, there are only remnants of these exploiting classes. The last exploiting class—the rural bourgeoisie, that is, the rich peasant class—has been squeezed into a very small space.

Rakosi pointed out that the number, level of consciousness, cultural level, and organization of the working class, which now holds political power, have greatly increased. The number of workers is 500,000 more than before the war, an increase of almost 50 percent. Within the working class, the state of division of the past decades has been eliminated. The working class has become the leading class of the country, a politically unified and goal-oriented, unified, and organized class.

The working peasants are no longer an oppressed and enslaved class tormented by bankers, landlords, and rich peasants. Most of the peasants have risen to the level of middle peasants.

The intellectuals have become a new and powerful force, and their basic masses are no longer bourgeois intellectuals, because the bourgeoisie on which this important social stratum depends for its livelihood no longer exists.

In the past ten years, the material living conditions of the Hungarian working people have undergone fundamental changes. For example, in the first half of 1954, the actual wages of factory workers averaged 57 percent higher than in 1938. In the first half of this year, the actual income of farmers increased by 50 percent compared with 1938.

The greatest achievement in the past decade has been the realization of the great Lenin's brilliant theory: the establishment of a solid worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the new Hungarian regime.

Rakosi pointed out that new and enormous driving forces of social development such as the worker-peasant alliance, the growing socialist patriotism, and the growing and consolidating spiritual and political unity of the Hungarian working people have emerged in the past decade and are playing an increasingly important role. In addition to these new driving forces, the fact that Hungary belongs to the powerful socialist camp of 800 million people is also playing a role in the development of our society.

Rakosi continued: The Soviet Union not only opened up the road for our development, but also consistently provided us with economic, political, technical, scientific, and other assistance, enabling our people to overcome the difficulties they face. The Soviet Union's assistance and its rich experience have always promoted our construction work. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its wise policies, based on the solid foundation of Marxism-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, are the lighthouse that illuminates all our work.

Rakosi elaborated on the international environment in which Hungary is located and pointed out that the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace camp are unswervingly fighting for peace. He said: Peace is the main guarantee for our forward development, so we should implement a foreign policy that consolidates peace, eases international tensions, and expands international cooperation. The purpose of our foreign policy is to cooperate with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Consolidating friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace camp, and further strengthening cooperation with the Soviet Union and other friendly countries, is the foundation of our foreign policy. The interests of the Hungarian people require first and foremost the prevention of the revival of German militarism and German imperialism. Therefore, the Hungarian people fully sympathize with and support every step taken by the Soviet Union to peacefully and democratically resolve the German and Austrian questions. We fully support the Soviet Union's proposal at the Berlin Conference to conclude an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe, a treaty that would enable the Hungarian People's Republic to actively participate in the cause of establishing international cooperation as an equal member with all European countries, large and small. Finally, the Hungarian people believe that Hungary must be admitted to the United Nations in accordance with the obligations assumed by the Western powers when concluding the peace treaty, so that Hungary can work in the United Nations to safeguard peace, ease international tensions, and ban weapons of mass destruction.

Rakosi then spoke about Hungary's national economic problems, pointing out the rapid development of industrial production, especially the production of means of production. In the three years since the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party (1951-1953), industrial production has increased by 73 percent. During the same period, the production of heavy industry increased by 118.8 percent, light industry production increased by 40.7 percent, and food industry production increased by 63.2 percent. Labor productivity in the industrial sector increased by 27 percent. The total production cost only decreased by 8 percent. Rakosi said that therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the level of cost reduction. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that in the rapid development of industrialization, especially heavy industry, serious errors were caused by not taking into account the domestic reality, resources, and the living needs of the working people. In the past three years, the production of heavy industry and light industry and the food industry has been extremely unbalanced. Due to the excessive pursuit of industrialization, we have not paid due attention to the development of agriculture.

The basis of the first five-year plan was the experience gained in restoring the national economy and the achievements made in the process of implementing the three-year plan. Industrial production had increased by 37.5 percent by the end of the three-year plan compared with 1938; and by the end of the first five-year plan, Hungary's industrial production was to be more than three times that of 1938.

In the process of implementing the five-year plan, several new industrial products have been manufactured: trucks, dump trucks, buses, combine harvesters, and various new machine tools, which can be exported in addition to supplying the domestic market. In the past five years, 65 new industrial enterprises have been built domestically, and 84 enterprises have been expanded and rebuilt.

Due to the many achievements of the first five-year plan to date, Hungary has changed from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial country.

When talking about the great achievements, Rakosi said that everyone should not ignore the serious errors and shortcomings that have occurred in economic construction. The most serious imbalance in the development of our national economy is reflected in the proportion of industrial and agricultural development. Industry has developed rapidly, but agricultural production has hardly increased. The yield per unit area of land has only slightly exceeded the average yield per unit area before the war, and the number of cattle, pigs, and sheep has not exceeded the pre-war level.

When talking about the resolutions passed by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party in June, October, and December last year, Rakosi said: These resolutions put the tasks of eliminating the imbalance in the development of the national economy, first of all vigorously developing agricultural production, and accelerating the development of light industry and the food industry while continuously improving the people's living standards, in the first place.

In the new stage of socialist construction, the political, organizational, and ideological unity of our party, strengthening the ties between the party and the masses, and ensuring the thorough implementation of the unity and collectivity of leadership according to principles throughout the party, especially in the party's leading organs, are of decisive significance.

The characteristics of the new stage of socialist construction in Hungary are as follows:

First, the development of productive forces in the national economy is closely linked to the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working class and all the people. That is to say, the basic law of socialism is playing an increasingly profound and broad role in society.

Second, eliminate the imbalances that have arisen.

Third, the policy of socialist industrialization relies heavily on the economic cooperation of the socialist camp countries, and socialist industrialization is the basic means for building socialism in Hungary and the basic means for the entire socialist economic construction. Especially because the national economic plans of Hungary and the national economic plans of the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union in Europe are mutually adapted, this cooperation is carried out at a higher level.

Fourth, rapidly develop economic, trade, and cultural relations between urban and rural areas at the same time.

Fifth, on this basis, the alliance between the working class and the working peasants will be raised to a higher level, the leadership of the working class in the worker-peasant alliance will also reach a higher level, and the power of the working class allied with the working peasants will be further consolidated.

Rakosi talked about the initial achievements made due to the implementation of the party's resolutions. First of all, the material life of all residents has been significantly improved. The two price reductions in the second half of last year and the price reduction of meat and oil in March this year will save residents 2.1 billion forints each year. This year, housing construction has almost doubled compared with last year. The work of repairing houses has begun on a large scale. Enterprises pay great attention to the development of labor protection, technical safety, and health care. This year, almost half of all employees have already increased their wages, and they will continue to increase. Pensions will also be increased.

Farmers' incomes have also increased. According to the party's resolution, the government has reduced and pre-determined the farmers' obligation sales quotas for several years, and has given agricultural production cooperatives considerable preferential treatment in terms of obligation sales. The government has lifted restrictions on farmers' free sale of surplus products. Due to the party's and the government's policy, farmers' interest in increasing production has been aroused. Trade between cities and villages has become active, and the goods sold to the countryside through state-owned trade and cooperative networks have greatly increased. Although the goods transported to the urban market are not enough, they have also increased.

However, so far, only preliminary prerequisites have actually been created for the development of agricultural production. More enormous, tenacious, and persistent work must be carried out to implement the Party and the Council of Ministers' resolution of December 23, 1953 on the development of agricultural production.

The Hungarian Working People's Party's policy on the peasant question has always unswervingly followed Lenin's famous slogan: "Be able to reach an agreement with the middle peasants, and never give up the struggle against the rich peasants for a minute, but rely firmly on the poor peasants."

Of course, our party and the working class firmly rely on the peasants who have joined the cooperative.

Now, agricultural production cooperatives own 18 percent of the country's cultivated land, and their cultivated area exceeds 1.7 million holds. 200,000 farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and there are more than 250,000 members.

At present, state-owned farms occupy 12.5 percent of the country's cultivated land. But they have not yet utilized the enormous potential in socialist large economies. The most urgent tasks of state-owned farms are to improve management, improve leadership, consolidate discipline, stabilize labor, effectively prevent the waste of state property, and formulate strict systems in all the work of state-owned farms.

Rakosi then talked about the development of state-owned trade and cooperative trade. This year, the retail trade volume will increase by 19 percent compared with last year.

When talking about the tasks of the second five-year plan, Rakosi said that when compiling the second five-year plan and determining its basic tasks and basic indicators, we must pay attention to the characteristics of the new stage of socialist construction in our country, we must ensure the elimination of imbalances in the national economy, we must ensure that we do not repeat the error of too rapid industrialization, and we must ensure that during the second five-year plan, the development of the national economy and the improvement of the people's welfare are always consistently maintained in corresponding proportions. After the completion of the second five-year plan, the currently backward agriculture will catch up with socialist industry. The socialist production system will dominate the entire national economy.

Rakosi then elaborated on the issue of consolidating the people's democratic social system and national system, and elaborated on the tasks of cultural construction.

The last part of Rakosi's report talked about consolidating the Hungarian Working People's Party. He pointed out that our party has been fighting for the freedom of our people and for the victory of the socialist cause for nearly forty years. For twenty-five years, it struggled underground, in the difficult conditions of secrecy, for the vital interests of the working class and the working people, carried out heroic and selfless struggles against the reactionaries, and when it was brutally persecuted, it had already won the support, love, and gratitude of the outstanding children of the people. In just the ten years since the liberation of our country, the Hungarian Working People's Party has become a recognized leading force in the country and confidently leads the country forward. Under the leadership of the working class, the working people have become the masters of the country. The unity of the party has been strengthened and is stronger than ever before, because the unity of the party's leadership has been strengthened. The basis on which the party's leadership is based is strict and principled unity, and the basic requirement for the party's leadership is to lead the party and build a socialist society. To ensure that the party can always serve the people most successfully in any situation and protect the people from the attacks of enemies. One of the most important achievements of the Hungarian Working People's Party in struggle and work is that it convened this congress with unity and a stronger contingent. The reason why the party can gain strength and have influence is because it is the party of the working people, it is united with the working people and strives to realize their aspirations.

He then talked about how to improve the party's work. He said that self-criticism has not been carried out satisfactorily, and higher-level organizations have not given due support to criticism from below. Criticism and self-criticism are one of the most important driving forces for the development of the party, so the party must carry out criticism and self-criticism as much as possible to quickly and thoroughly eliminate shortcomings in work and improve work.

Since the Second Party Congress, the number of grass-roots organizations has greatly increased. As of January 1, 1951, there were a total of 12,933 grass-roots organizations, while as of January 1, 1954, the number had increased to 21,551. There are a total of 864,607 party members, including 810,227 party members and 54,380 alternate party members.

Rakosi talked in detail about the party's ideological work and cadre work.

Rakosi finally said: The general line of our party is to build the foundation of socialism in our country, while continuously improving the material and cultural level of our people, and tirelessly striving to build socialism in a peaceful environment. To realize the party's general line, we must first further expand and strengthen the party's ties with the working people, more closely unite the party's ranks, so that our party is more united than ever before, because the party's main strength, in addition to the party having the correct policies, also lies in the party's ideological, political, and organizational unity, and in the party's unity of action. Therefore, we should cherish the unity of the party like the pupils of our eyes, like cherishing the most precious things.

We should ensure that the enemy not only cannot find cracks in our party, but even cannot find cracks.

In order to successfully realize the party's general line, we must further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and make it an unbreakable alliance. The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our people's country and a guarantee for consolidating our achievements and achieving new victories.

We must expand the foundation on which the party's policies and our people's country are based. We must expand the broad alliance of all patriotic and peace-loving forces in the People's Independence Front.

In order to realize the party's general line, it is required to continuously strengthen our worker-peasant state—the people's democratic state, and require the broad masses to more actively participate in the work of the state and conduct supervision.

In order to guarantee the victory of the party's general line, it is necessary to deepen and strengthen the friendship between our people and the Soviet Union, which is building communism—our liberator, the banner of the struggle to defend peace in the world, and with the people's democratic countries, and make this friendship increasingly close and sincere. We must approach all countries that are fighting against imperialist wars of aggression and for their own independence and peace.

    在匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会上
    拉科西作第一项议程的报告
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记马加斯·拉科西二十四日在匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会上作了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会工作总结和匈牙利劳动人民党的任务的报告。
    拉科西说：自从光荣的苏军开入匈牙利国境、解放我们祖国以来，今年快满十年了。自从成立临时国民议会和成立临时国民政府、因而使匈牙利国家得以复兴以来，今年也快满十年了。我们的祖国获得自由已经有十个年头了。
    如果把匈牙利解放以来这一段时期回顾一下，那么可以看出：在我们一千年的历史中，我们人民从来不曾经历过像这十年中这样深刻的经济、社会、政治和文化的变革。
    拉科西说，在整个十年中，我们祖国的经济制度起了根本的变化，我们的经济结构完全改变了，我国的生产方式改变了，生产关系改变了。社会主义生产方式是工业、运输业、贸易和银行等方面的唯一的占统治地位的制度。匈牙利社会的阶级结构也根本改变了，各个阶级本身和各阶级之间的关系也改变了。地主和大的土地所有者阶级被消灭了。在匈牙利，工业资产阶级作为一个阶级已不存在了。现在，在匈牙利只有这些剥削阶级的残余。最后一个剥削阶级——农村资产阶级，即富农阶级，已被排挤到很小的天地里了。
    拉科西指出，现在掌握政权的工人阶级的数目、觉悟程度、文化水平和组织性都大大地增长了。工人阶级人数比战前多了五十万，即几乎增加百分之五十。在工人阶级内部，数十年来的分裂状态被消灭了。工人阶级已成为国家的领导阶级，成为政治上一致的和目标明确的、统一和有组织的阶级。
    劳动农民已不再是受银行家、地主和富农折磨的、被压迫和被奴役的阶级。大部分的农民都已上升为中农。
    知识分子已成为一支新的强大力量，他们的基本群众已不再是资产阶级知识分子，因为这一重要的社会阶层所赖以为生的资产阶级本身已经不存在了。
    最近十年中，匈牙利劳动人民的物质生活状况起了根本的变化。例如，一九五四年上半年工厂工人的实际工资平均比一九三八年提高了百分之五十七。今年上半年农民的实际收入比一九三八年提高了百分之五十。
    最近十年中所取得的最大的成就便是实现了伟大列宁的天才学说：建立巩固的工农联盟，这一联盟是匈牙利新政权的基础。
    拉科西指出，像工农联盟、增长着的社会主义爱国精神以及日益增长和巩固的匈牙利劳动人民精神上和政治上的团结一致这样一些社会发展的新的巨大动力在最近十年中显示出来了，并越来越起着巨大的作用。除了这些新的动力外，匈牙利属于八亿人口的强大的社会主义阵营这一事实同时也对我国社会的发展起着作用。
    拉科西接着说：苏联不仅是为我们的发展开辟了道路，它并且一贯地给予我们以经济、政治、技术、科学和其他各方面的援助，使我国人民能够克服他们所面临的困难。苏联的援助和它的丰富经验一直促进着我们的建设工作。苏联共产党及它的建立在马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学说的坚实基础上的英明政策是照耀我们一切工作的灯塔。
    拉科西详细地论述了匈牙利所处的国际环境，并指出苏联及和平阵营其他各国正坚持不渝地为和平而斗争。他说：和平是我们向前发展的主要保证，因此我们应该执行巩固和平、缓和国际紧张局势、扩大国际合作的外交政策。我国的外交政策的目的就是在平等与互利的基础上与其他各国合作。巩固与苏联及和平阵营其他各国的友谊，进一步加强与苏联及其他友好国家的合作，这就是我国外交政策的基础。匈牙利人民的利益首先要求防止德国军国主义与德国帝国主义的复活。因此，匈牙利人民完全同情与拥护苏联每一个旨在和平民主地解决德国问题与奥地利问题的步骤。我们全力支持苏联在柏林会议上所提出的缔结一个保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议，这样一个条约将使得匈牙利人民共和国有可能作为平等一员与欧洲各大小国家一起积极参加建立国际合作的事业。最后，匈牙利人民认为，必须根据西方大国在缔结和约时所承担的义务，接纳匈牙利参加联合国，以便匈牙利能在联合国中为保障和平、缓和国际紧张局势和禁止大规模毁灭性武器而努力。
    拉科西继而谈到匈牙利的国民经济问题，他指出了工业生产，特别是生产资料的生产的迅速发展。自匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会以来的三年当中（一九五一年至一九五三年），工业生产已增加百分之七十三。同时期重工业的生产增加百分之一百一十八点八，轻工业生产增加百分之四十点七，食品工业生产增加百分之六十三点二。工业部门的劳动生产率提高百分之二十七。而生产成本总共只减低百分之八。拉科西说道，因此，我们对成本减低了的水平不能感到满意。另一方面应当指出的是，在工业化，特别是重工业的飞速发展过程中，由于没有考虑到国内的实际情况、资源和劳动人民的生活需要而引起了严重错误。在过去三年当中，重工业和轻工业、食品业的生产极不平衡。由于过分追求工业化，我们没有对农业的发展给予应有的注意。
    第一个五年计划依据的基础是恢复全国国民经济中所获得的经验和实现三年计划的过程中所取得的成就。工业生产到三年计划完成的时候已比一九三八年增加了百分之三十七点五；而到第一个五年计划结束的时候，匈牙利的工业生产就要增为一九三八年的三倍以上。
    在实现五年计划的过程中，已可以制造若干种新工业品：载重汽车、自动卸货卡车、公共汽车、联合机、各种新式机床，这些工业品除了供应国内市场外，还可以输出。五年以来，国内建成了六十五个新的工业企业，并扩大和改建了八十四个企业。
    由于第一个五年计划到目前为止已获得很多成就，匈牙利已从农业—工业国变为工业国。
    拉科西在谈到巨大的成就时说，大家也不能忽视经济建设中所产生的严重的错误和缺点。我国国民经济发展的最严重的不平衡现象是表现在工业和农业的发展比例上。工业发展得很快，而农业生产却几乎没有增加。土地单位面积产量只稍稍超过了战前平均单位面积产量，而牛、猪与羊的头数还没有超过战前的水平。
    拉科西在谈到匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会在去年六月、十月和十二月所通过的一些决议时说：这些决议把消除国民经济发展的不平衡现象，首先是大力发展农业生产以及加速轻工业和食品工业的发展同时不断提高人民的生活水平这些任务提到了第一位。
    在社会主义建设的新阶段，我们党在政治上、组织上与思想上的统一，加强党与群众的联系以及在全党，特别是在党的领导机关中，保证根据原则彻底贯彻领导的统一与集体性，就具有决定性的意义了。
    匈牙利社会主义建设的新阶段的特点如下：
    第一、国民经济中生产力的发展是和不断提高工人阶级与全体人民的生活水平紧密联系在一起的。这就是说，社会主义的基本法则已愈来愈深刻而广泛地在社会中起着作用。
    第二、消除已产生的不平衡现象。
    第三、社会主义工业化政策在很大程度上依靠着社会主义阵营国家的经济合作，而社会主义工业化则是在匈牙利建成社会主义的基本手段和整个社会主义经济建设的基本手段。特别是由于匈牙利国民经济计划和欧洲各人民民主国家以及苏联的国民经济计划互相适应，所以这种合作是在更高的水平上进行的。
    第四、同时迅速发展城乡间的经济、贸易和文化关系。
    第五、在这一切基础上，工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟将提到更高的水平，工人阶级在工农联盟中的领导也将要达到更高的水平，和劳动农民结成联盟的工人阶级的政权将更加巩固。
    拉科西谈到由于执行党的决议所获得的初步成就。首先是全体居民物质生活得到了显著的改善。去年下半年的两度减低物价以及今年三月间减低肉类和油类价格，将使居民每年节省二十一亿福林。在今年，住宅建筑差不多增为去年的两倍。修理住宅的工作已开始大规模进行。企业中非常注意劳动保护、技术安全和保健事业的发展。在今年，全体职工将近有一半人已经提高了工资，而且还要提高。养老金也要提高。
    农民的收入也增加了。政府根据党的决议，减少了并预先规定了农民几年的义务交售额，并在义务交售方面给予农业生产合作社相当大的优待。政府取消了对农民自由出卖剩余产品的限制。由于党和政府的这种政策，引起了农民增加生产的兴趣。城市和乡村之间的贸易活跃起来了，通过国营贸易和合作社网，售给乡村的货物大大增加。运输到城市市场上的物品，虽然不够，但是也有了增加。
    然而到现在为止，实际上仅仅为发展农业生产创造了初步先决条件。必须进行更为巨大的、顽强的和坚持不懈的工作，以实现党和部长会议一九五三年十二月二十三日关于发展农业生产的决议。
    匈牙利劳动人民党关于农民问题的政策，始终不渝地遵循着列宁的著名口号：“要善于与中农达到协定，一分钟也不放弃反富农的斗争，而只是稳稳地倚靠着贫农”。
    当然，我们的党和工人阶级稳稳地依靠着参加了合作社的农民。
    现在，农业生产合作社拥有的耕地占全国耕地的百分之十八，它们的耕地面积超过一百七十万霍尔德。有二十万农户参加了农业生产合作社，社员共有二十五万多人。
    目前国营农场的耕地占全国耕地面积的百分之十二点五。但是它们还没有利用社会主义大经济中的巨大潜力。国营农场最迫切的任务是：改善经营，提高领导水平，巩固纪律，固定劳动力，有效地防止浪费国家财产，在国营农场的全部工作中制订严格的制度。
    拉科西接着谈到国营贸易和合作社贸易发展的情况，今年零售贸易额将比去年提高百分之十九。
    拉科西在谈到第二个五年计划的任务时说，在编制第二个五年计划并决定其基本任务和基本指标时，必须注意到我国社会主义建设新阶段的特点，必须保证消除国民经济中不平衡的现象，必须保证不致重复工业化速度太快的错误，必须保证在第二个五年计划期间，国民经济的发展和人民福利的提高始终一贯地保持相应的比例。第二个五年计划完成后，目前落后的农业将赶上社会主义工业。社会主义生产制度在整个国民经济中将占统治地位。
    拉科西接着详细阐述了巩固人民民主的社会制度和国家制度的问题，阐述了文化建设的任务。
    拉科西报告的最后一部分谈到巩固匈牙利劳动人民党的问题。他指出，我们的党为我国人民的自由、为社会主义事业的胜利而奋斗已将近有四十年了。有二十五年它在地下、在秘密状态的艰苦条件下为工人阶级和劳动人民的切身利益而斗争，对反动派进行了英勇的和忘我的斗争，当它处于被残忍地迫害的情况下，就已取得了人民的优秀儿女们的支持、爱戴和感激。仅在我国解放后的十年中，匈牙利劳动人民党就已成为被公认的国家的领导力量，并满怀信心地领导着国家向前发展。在工人阶级领导下，劳动人民变成了国家的主人。党的团结加强了，比过去任何时候更坚强了，这是因为党的领导的团结加强了。党的领导所依据的基础是严格的、原则上的团结一致，对党的领导的基本要求就是要领导党和建设社会主义社会。要使党在任何情况下都能始终如一地最成功地为人民服务，保护人民不受敌人的攻击。匈牙利劳动人民党在斗争中和工作中最重大的成就之一就是：它在团结一致、队伍更为壮大的情况下召开了这次代表大会。党所以能取得力量和有影响是由于它是劳动人民的党，它与劳动人民群众团结一致并为实现他们的愿望而努力。
    他继而谈到如何改进党的工作。他说，自我批评开展得还不能令人满意，上级组织没有对来自下面的批评作应有的支持。批评和自我批评是党的发展的最重要的动力之一，因而党必须尽量开展批评与自我批评以迅速地和彻底地消灭工作中的缺点和改进工作。
    自第二次党代表大会召开以来，基层组织的数量大大地增加了。到一九五一年一月一日为止，共有一万二千九百三十三个基层组织，而截至一九五四年一月一日，已增加到二万一千五百五十一个。党员人数共有八十六万四千六百零七人，其中有八十一万零二百二十七名党员和五万四千三百八十名候补党员。
    拉科西详细地谈了党的思想工作问题和干部工作。
    拉科西最后说：我们党的总路线是：在我国建成社会主义的基础，同时不断地提高我国人民的物质和文化水平，不倦地争取使我们能在和平环境下建设社会主义。要实现党的总路线，必须首先更加扩大和加强党与劳动人民的联系，更紧密地团结党的队伍，以使我们党比过去任何时候更加团结一致，因为党的主要力量，除去党有正确的政策外，还在于党的思想、政治和组织上的团结一致，在于党的行动一致。因此我们应该像爱护眼珠一样，像爱惜最宝贵的东西一样来爱护党的统一。
    应该做到使敌人不只是在我们党内找不到裂口，而且甚至连裂痕都找不到。
    为了胜利地实现党的总路线，必须更加加强工农联盟，使它成为牢不可破的联盟。工农联盟是我们人民国家的基础，是巩固我们所取得的成果与取得新的胜利的保证。
    必须扩大党的政策和我们人民国家所依据的基础。必须扩展人民独立阵线这样一个全国所有爱国力量与爱好和平力量的广泛的联盟。
    为了实现党的总路线，要求不断加强我们的工农国家——人民民主国家，要求有广大的群众更积极地参加国家的工作与进行监督。
    为了保证党的总路线的胜利，必须加深与加强我们人民与建设着共产主义的苏联——我国的解放者、全世界保卫和平斗争的旗手，以及与各人民民主国家的友谊，并使这种友谊日益紧密与真诚。必须与一切为反对帝国主义侵略战争、为争取自己的独立与和平而斗争的国家接近。
