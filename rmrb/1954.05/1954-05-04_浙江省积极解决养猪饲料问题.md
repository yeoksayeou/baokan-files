    Zhejiang Province is actively seeking solutions to the shortage of pig feed, supporting farmers in raising more pigs. In order to meet the people's need for meat and increase fertilizer accumulation, Zhejiang Province plans to raise more than 3.3 million pigs this year, an increase of more than 66,000 from last year. The Grain Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government has allocated a portion of coarse grains to be supplied to various places through supply and marketing cooperatives, so that various places can obtain the necessary concentrated feed before the harvest of feed crops. Yongkang County, based on the local shortage of concentrated feed, has decided to supply more than 83,000 jin of barley, and mobilized farmers to plant potatoes, pumpkins and other crops that can be used as feed in a planned way. In the past, farmers in the county directly used bean cake to fertilize the fields, which was a great waste. Now the county is mobilizing farmers to use bean cake to feed pigs, in order to solve the feed problem and accumulate more manure.
    Recently, Hang County held a pig-raising forum attended by representatives of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and veterinarians. The meeting focused on discussing solutions to the feed problem and arranging feed for the four seasons of the year. The Agricultural and Forestry Section of the Xiangshan County People's Government also invited village cadres with experience in pig raising from various places to a forum during the county-wide cadre meeting to discuss the benefits of raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer and solutions to the feed problem.

    浙江省积极解决养猪饲料问题
    浙江省积极设法解决喂猪饲料不足的问题，支持农民多喂养毛猪。为了满足人民对肉食的需要和增积肥料，浙江省今年计划养猪三百三十多万只，比去年增加六万六千多只。浙江省人民政府粮食厅已拨出一部分杂粮，交供销合作社供应各地，以便使各地在饲料作物收割前得到必需的精饲料。永康县也根据当地精饲料不足的情况，决定供应大麦八万三千多斤，并动员农民有计划地多种马铃薯、南瓜等可以当饲料的作物。该县农民过去都是直接用豆饼肥田，浪费很大，现在该县动员农民用豆饼喂猪，以解决饲料问题，并增积更多的厩肥。
    最近杭县召开了一次有农业生产合作社、互助组代表和兽医代表参加的养猪座谈会，会上着重讨论了解决饲料问题的办法，安排了一年四季的饲料。象山县人民政府农林科在全县干部大会期间，也邀请各地对养猪有经验的村干部开了一个座谈会，讨论了养猪积肥的好处和解决饲料问题的办法。
