    Naadam Festival Held in Ih Ju League, Inner Mongolia
    Total Transaction Volume Exceeded 14 Billion Yuan
    The Ih Ju League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held its league-wide Naadam Festival from April 23rd to 29th. More than 30,000 people of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups from various banners and counties erected tents and yurts on the Igin Horoo grassland, happily participating in various activities of the festival. The festival held an exhibition and cultural activities. The exhibition displayed hay balers, insecticide sprayers, seed treaters, and more than 20 kinds of mineral sands found locally, and distributed propaganda materials about the general task of the country during the transition period to the masses. These activities increased the knowledge of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups. In terms of cultural activities, in addition to wrestling, horse racing, and other sports, the Inner Mongolia National Song and Dance Troupe and the Ih Ju League Art Troupe performed many wonderful programs. The festival also unfolded a large-scale exchange of materials. Participating in the trade activities were the Baotou City trade delegation and trade delegations from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces. State-owned companies and cooperatives from various places used trucks and horse-drawn carts to transport a large number of goods such as cotton fabrics, silks and satins, leather boots, and saddles to supply the farmers and herdsmen attending the festival. Ih Ju League and various places also signed 84 purchase and sales contracts. Ih Ju League supplied Baotou City with more than 50,000 head of beef, sheep, pigs, and other livestock for meat; Baotou City will also supply Ih Ju League with a batch of embossing machines, shearing machines, chaff cutters, and insecticide sprayers. The pastoral areas of various banners also contributed 1,500 head of cattle, horses, and other livestock for use as draft animals in rural areas, and agricultural areas also supplied grain to pastoral areas. The total transaction volume of the festival reached more than 14 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by more than one time. (Xinhua News Agency)
