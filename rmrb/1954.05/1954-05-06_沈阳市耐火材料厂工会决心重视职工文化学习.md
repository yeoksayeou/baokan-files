Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

    Shenyang Refractory Materials Factory Union Resolves to Emphasize Workers' Cultural Learning
    Letter from the Shenyang Refractory Materials Factory Union Committee: Comrade Han Xizheng's criticism in the "Summary of Letters from Readers" column on March 30th is correct. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to workers' cultural learning, simply emphasizing the lack of time and busy production, without realizing that doing a good job in cultural learning to improve workers' political and ideological awareness and technical level is an important task to ensure the completion of production tasks. After seeing the criticism letter in the newspaper, the leaders of our factory's Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League held a special meeting to study the work of carrying out workers' cultural learning and made specific plans. The administrative leaders expressed their willingness to provide human and material support for workers' cultural learning and to guarantee workers' study time. The union's cultural and educational committee member and the full-time teachers of the cultural class also expressed that they must do a good job in cultural learning.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    沈阳市耐火材料厂工会决心重视职工文化学习
    沈阳市耐火材料厂工会委员会来信：三月三十日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊韩希正同志对我们的批评是正确的。过去，我们对职工的文化学习不够重视，单纯强调时间少、生产忙，而没有认识到搞好文化学习，以提高职工政治思想觉悟和技术水平，是保证完成生产任务的一件重要工作。看到报上的批评信后，我厂党组织、行政、工会和青年团的领导同志召开了一个专门会议，研究了开展职工文化学习的工作，并作出了具体计划。行政领导方面表示对职工文化学习要给以人力和物力上的支持，并保证职工的学习时间。工会文教委员和文化班的专职教员也表示一定要把文化学习工作搞好。
