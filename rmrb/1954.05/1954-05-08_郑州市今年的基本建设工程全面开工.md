    Zhengzhou's Basic Construction Projects Fully Underway This Year
    [This newspaper's Kaifeng dispatch, 7th] Basic construction in Zhengzhou has fully commenced. The total workload of Zhengzhou's sixty construction units this year is 55.5 percent greater than last year, and projects that have already started account for over 80 percent of the total annual task. Preparations for various construction projects were thorough, and the start date was moved up two months compared to last year. Currently, rows of construction scaffolding stand tall near the city, and vehicles carrying construction materials shuttle back and forth. At the construction site of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill, one of the four major new cotton textile mills being built this year, large quantities of timber, steel bars, seamless steel pipes, cement, asbestos tiles, and other materials have arrived. Workers from Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, and various parts of Henan Province who have come to support Zhengzhou's basic construction are operating new-style cranes, road rollers, and concrete mixers.
    In addition, six major projects that the state is newly constructing and expanding in Zhengzhou this year, including the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory and the Zhengzhou Oil and Fat Chemical Factory, as well as dozens of units such as the Textile Industry School, banks, and hospitals, have also commenced construction one after another.

    此外，国家今年在郑州新建和扩建的郑州纺织机械厂、郑州油脂化学厂等六项主要工程，以及纺织工业学校、银行、医院等数十个单位也先后动工。
