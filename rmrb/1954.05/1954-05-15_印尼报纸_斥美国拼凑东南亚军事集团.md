Indonesian Newspapers
Condemn US Plot to Form Southeast Asian Military Bloc
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 14th: People and newspapers in Jakarta have been widely discussing the successive failures of American policy from Geneva to Dien Bien Phu over the past week. However, Jakarta newspapers warn that there is no indication that the United States will change its policies; and point out that the United States is continuing to organize military blocs, trying to tie Southeast Asian countries to its war chariot.
	"Dongxing Bao" exposed the United States' efforts to organize the "Southeast Asia League" in an editorial on the 13th. The newspaper emphasized that the war of resistance of the Indochinese people was caused by French colonial measures. All Asian people, as well as the Indonesian people, will condemn any actions aimed at restoring one country's colonial rule over another.
	"Indonesia News" pointed out on the 13th: The failure of the United States has prompted it to impose the so-called collective security plan on Southeast Asian countries, the real purpose of which is to establish more American influence in these countries. The US plan is not to maintain peace, but to wage cold and hot wars against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other countries.
	"Independent News" said on the 12th: The US policy at the Geneva Conference is to make the conference fruitless in order to pave the way for the conclusion of the "Southeast Asia Security Treaty." The newspaper pointed out that if the United States continues to pursue a war policy in Indochina, it will be isolated.

    印尼报纸
    斥美国拼凑东南亚军事集团
    【新华社雅加达十四日电】雅加达人士和报纸在过去一星期中纷纷谈论美国政策从日内瓦一直到奠边府所遭到的接二连三的失败。然而，雅加达报纸警告说，没有迹象表明美国将改变它的政策；并指出，美国正在继续组织军事集团，想把东南亚国家缚在它的战车上。
    “东星报”在十三日社论中揭露美国竭力要组织“东南亚联盟”的阴谋。报纸强调说，印度支那人民的抗战是法国的殖民措施引起的。全亚洲人民以及印度尼西亚人民，将指责任何旨在恢复一国对另一国的殖民统治的行动。
    “印尼新闻报”十三日指出：美国的失败已经促使它要把所谓集体安全的计划强加在东南亚国家的身上，其真正的目的是要在这些国家里建立更多的美国的势力。美国的计划不是为了维护和平，而是为了要对苏联、中华人民共和国与其他国家进行冷战与热战。
    “独立报”十二日说：美国在日内瓦会议上的政策是要使得会议毫无结果，以便为缔结“东南亚安全公约”铺平道路。报纸指出，假若美国继续在印度支那执行战争政策，它就会陷于孤立。
