Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 29th: The state-owned Jixi Mining Machinery Factory has begun formal production this year of the Donbass-1 combined coal mining machine, electric rock loading machine, and pneumatic rock grabbing machine, which were successfully trial-produced in 1952 and 1953. The Donbass-1 combined coal mining machine is the latest Soviet machinery used for coal mining. Operated by only one worker, the machine can cut the coal seam, crush it into coal lumps, and automatically transport it out. It can mine over ten thousand tons of coal per month, far more than the coal mined by hundreds of workers using manual labor in the same period. The electric rock loading machine is an advanced machine for excavating rock roadways in mines. Its skip can load scattered rocks onto mine cars, loading 30 to 45 cubic meters of rock per hour, freeing tunneling workers from heavy manual labor. The pneumatic rock grabbing machine is a special machine for constructing vertical shaft projects. It is as flexible as human hands, able to reach the bottom of the shaft and grab rocks one by one, placing them into hoisting buckets for transport out of the shaft. The rock grabbing machine works faster than manual labor and greatly accelerates the progress of vertical shaft construction.

These three types of mining and excavation machinery were trial-produced based on Soviet design data. They are small in size but powerful, making them suitable for pit work. After the successful trial production of these three types of excavation machinery, they were repeatedly tested in coal mines in Fuxin, Jixi, and other places, and many improvements were made based on the test results before small-scale production began this year. Currently, the factory's workers are working intensely on processing parts for the combined coal mining machine, rock loading machine, and rock grabbing machine. In the casting and machining workshops, rows of long cylinders, skips, and processed parts for the combined coal mining machine can be seen neatly placed next to the machine tools. In the assembly workshop, workers are also excitedly packing the completed three types of machinery into wooden crates, preparing them for exhibition in Beijing and Leipzig, German Democratic Republic.

    鸡西矿山机械厂开始生产三种采掘机械
     【新华社哈尔滨二十九日电】国营鸡西矿山机械厂在一九五二年和一九五三年试制成功的顿巴斯一型联合采煤机、电力装岩机和气力抓岩机，今年开始正式生产。顿巴斯一型联合采煤机是苏联用于矿山采煤的最新机械。只用一个工人操纵机械，就能将煤层割开，破碎成煤块，自动地运输出去，它一个月能挖出上万吨的煤，比数百个工人在一个月内用体力劳动所挖出的煤多得多。电力装岩机是矿山开掘岩石巷道的先进机械，它的翻斗能将散在地上的岩石装到矿车上，一小时能装三十到四十五立方公尺的岩石，可使掘进工人装岩石时，免去繁重的体力劳动。气力抓岩机是建设竖井井筒工程的特殊机械，它像人们的手一样的灵活，能伸到井底把岩石一把一把地抓起来，放到提升罐斗里，运出井外。抓岩机比手工工作得快，对加快竖井建设进度有很大的作用。
    这三种矿山采掘机械都是根据苏联设计资料试制的，它们体积较小而力量大，适宜于坑井工作。这三种采掘机械试制成功后，曾经过阜新、鸡西等地煤矿多次试用，并根据试用结果作了多次改进，才在今年开始小批生产。现在这个工厂的职工正在紧张地加工联合采煤机、装岩机、抓岩机的零件。在铸造、机械等车间里已可以看到一排一排长气缸、翻斗和经过加工的联合采煤机零件整齐地放在机床的旁边。在装配车间里，工人们也正兴奋地把已制成的这三种机械装到木箱里，准备运到北京和德意志民主共和国莱比锡去展览。
