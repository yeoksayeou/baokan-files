    Guarantee to Report Good News with Greater Achievements
    Zhang Zhenguo
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:
    I am a journalist, and I have been reporting at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant for a long time. The workers' high level of labor enthusiasm, the rapid changes in Ma'anshan, and especially your care and support for Ma'anshan, often excite me. I remember about ten months ago, the workers here received a batch of letters from you from the Korean front, and you all expressed a common thought and feeling in different words: hoping that Ma'anshan would be built up quickly. Comrade Sun Yuxian studied and worked here in 1949, overlooking the ships on the Yangtze River from the top of the mountain, and catching crabs in the stream at the foot of the mountain. Therefore, he is very familiar with everything here. In his letter, he wrote: "When I was there, Ma'anshan was still a desolate place, and the iron-smelting furnace that had not been lit for more than eight years was quietly sleeping there. However, I knew that it contained countless underground treasures, and I have always been concerned about its revival and growth."
    Ma'anshan has indeed been revived and has grown up. It is no longer a desolate place, but has become a magnificent iron and steel plant. The reconstruction project of six blast furnaces was completed ahead of schedule in November last year and put into production one after another. The quality of the pig iron produced is good, and the output is four to five times higher than the highest output during the Japanese puppet regime. Moreover, blast furnaces No. 3, 4, 5, and 6 successively created new national records for small blast furnaces smelting foundry iron and steelmaking pig iron in January and March of this year! Especially now—with the arrival of spring, the appearance of Ma'anshan is even more beautiful, and the workers' enthusiasm for production is even greater. The willows on Ma'anshan are already green and shady, and the wheat fields in front and behind the mountain are also covered with lush green colors. A row of chimneys as high as ten stories, dozens of blast furnaces and hot blast stoves like iron towers stand tall in the sky, and the red-hot molten iron roars from the tapping hole into the sand molds, solidifying into thousands of tons of iron ingots.
    Dear comrades, when talking about these achievements, I naturally think of the encouraging effect of your letters on the workers here. In July last year, when the reconstruction project of Ma'anshan was underway, suddenly the small flue pipe of a pile driver was blocked by coal ash, and the flue could not emit smoke, and the fire was about to suffocate. Yang Dianchen, a pile driver, was anxious when he saw this situation. He wanted to go up and clear the flue, but the flue was scorching hot from the fire; if he didn't go up, the fire would go out and work would have to stop, and the task could not be completed on schedule. At this critical moment, he remembered the determination he had expressed to the organization when he came here: In order to industrialize the motherland, he would never bow to difficulties! He also remembered the letter from your Comrade Zhu Huaiyu: "Every high-quality piece of iron you produce is like our weight increasing by an ounce or two... We must defend you with new victories, and for a beautiful future, we will not hesitate to give our precious lives!" Therefore, he endured the severe pain and climbed onto the pile driver to clear the flue. Soon, the flue was cleared, and his ears, mouth, and nostrils were filled with coal smoke. He fainted on the construction site from the heat and smoke, but the pile driving task for the day was overfulfilled! Wang Jiakuan is only nineteen years old and a member of the Communist Youth League. He grew up in the countryside and came here in the second half of the year before last. He was very unfamiliar with the new operating techniques, but he had a spirit of hard work. He and everyone else braved the piercing cold wind, cleaned up the snow on the construction site, and dismantled the old blast furnaces... His hands were blistered, and the axe handle was stained red with blood, his feet were chapped from the cold, and his clothes were covered with ice, but he didn't care and continued to work hard and happily, and encouraged everyone, saying: "We are not afraid of strong winds and heavy snow, the working class is powerful, overcoming difficulties is a hero, and learning from the Volunteer Army strives to be a model!"
    Now, the workers' hard work has blossomed and borne fruit. The pig iron they produce is continuously transported to various parts of East China and Central South China, supporting the industrial construction of our country. In the past, the pig iron used in Shanghai had to be transported from Anshan, Benxi, Taiyuan, and other places, and the transportation time was at least five to ten days. Now, the pig iron from Ma'anshan can be transported to Shanghai in just over ten hours by land and only over thirty hours by water. This not only reduces the freight cost by more than 100,000 yuan per ton of pig iron, overcomes the past situation of untimely supply, but also saves the country thousands of freight cars every year for other transportation work. In thousands of large and small factories, the pig iron transported from here is rolled into various steels and cast into various heavy machines, electrical switches, punch presses, lathes, planers..., and transported to various industrial construction posts in the motherland. In the Bengbu and Suxian iron factories in Anhui and the Shandong farm tool factory, workers used pig iron produced in Ma'anshan to make a large number of new-style walking plows, sweet potato slicers, waterwheels, pumps..., and transported them to the vast rural areas, supporting the agricultural production of our country. In addition, the pig iron produced here has also been turned into concrete mixers, water pipes, road rollers, coal feeders, etc. in more than 400 foundry factories in Shanghai and transported to cities to support municipal construction.
    Comrades, you see, from cities to rural areas, from industry to agriculture, everywhere you can see the fruits of the labor of the Ma'anshan workers. How can they not be excited! Now, they have successfully overfulfilled the national production plan for the first quarter and are confidently engaged in the production competition for the second quarter. The people building Ma'anshan guarantee to report good news to you with greater achievements!

### 保证以更大的成绩向你们报喜

    保证以更大的成绩向你们报喜
    张振国亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    我是一个新闻工作者，在马鞍山铁厂采访已经很长的时间了。工人的高度劳动热情，马鞍山日新月异的变化，特别是你们对马鞍山的关怀和支持，常常在激动着我。记得是十个月以前的时候，这里的工人接到了一批你们从朝鲜前线寄来的信件，你们都用不同的语句倾吐了共同的思想感情：希望马鞍山很快建设起来。孙裕贤同志一九四九年曾在这里学习过，劳动过，在山顶上俯视过长江的船只，在山下的小溪里捉过螃蟹，因此，他对这里的一切都很熟悉。他在来信中写道：“我在那里时，马鞍山还是一片荒凉，八年多没有点过火的炼铁炉还悄悄地睡在那里。但是，我知道那里却蕴藏着数不清的地下宝藏，我始终关怀着它的复活和成长。”
    马鞍山的确是复活了，而且已经成长起来了。这里，再不是一片荒凉，而变成了一座雄伟壮丽的铁工厂。六座炼铁炉的改建工程，在去年十一月份提前完成了，并先后投入了生产。生产出来的生铁的质量良好，产量超过日伪时期最高产量的四倍到五倍，而且，三、四、五、六号炼铁炉，在今年一月和三月连续创造了全国小型炼铁炉冶炼翻砂和炼钢生铁的新纪录！特别是现在——春天到来的时候，马鞍山的面貌显得更美丽，工人的生产劲头也更足了。马鞍山山上的柳树已经碧绿成荫，山前山后的麦田也披上了葱绿的颜色，一排有十层楼那么高的烟囱、数十座像铁塔一样的炼铁炉和热风炉高耸天空，通红的铁水吼叫着从出铁口流进砂模，凝成成千上万吨的铁块。
    亲爱的同志们，谈到这些成绩，我很自然地又联想到你们的来信对这里工人的鼓舞作用。去年七月间，那时马鞍山的改建工程正在进行，突然间一个打桩机上的小烟筒管被煤灰堵住了，烟筒冒不出烟，炉火眼看就要叫窒死了。打桩工人杨殿臣看到这种情景就急了，他想上去通一通烟筒，可是烟筒叫火烤得烫人；不上去吧，火一熄就要停工，任务就不能按期完成。在这紧急的关头，他想起了到这里来时向组织上表示过的决心：为了祖国工业化，决不向困难低头！他也想起了你们那里的祝怀钰同志的来信：“你们生产出一块优质的铁，就好像我们的体重增加了一两斤一样……我们要以新的胜利来保卫你们，为了美丽的未来，不惜宝贵的生命！”因此，他忍受着剧烈的疼痛，爬上了打桩机去打通烟筒。很快，烟筒打通了，他的耳朵里、口腔里、鼻孔里也灌满了煤烟，连烫带薰，下来后他就晕倒在工地上，可是当天的打桩任务却超额完成了！王家宽才十九岁，是一个青年团员。他生长在农村，前年下半年才来到这里。新的操作技术他是很生疏的，可是他有着苦干的精神。他和大家一块，冒着刺骨的寒风，打扫过工地上的积雪，拆除过旧有的炼铁炉……。他的手磨破了，鲜血染红了斧柄，脚冻裂了，衣服上结了冰，但他满不在乎，继续在紧张愉快地劳动着，还鼓励大家说：“大风大雪咱不怕，工人阶级力量大，克服困难是好汉，学习志愿军争取当模范！”
    现在，工人们的辛勤劳动已经开花结果了。他们制造出来的生铁，源源不断地运到华东和中南各地，支援着咱们国家的工业建设。上海过去所用的生铁，都要从鞍山、本溪、太原等地运来，运输时间最少也得五天到十天。现在马鞍山的生铁，陆路只需要十多个小时，水路也只要三十多个小时就可以运到上海。这样不但每吨生铁可减少十多万元的运费，克服了过去供应不及时的情况，每年还能给国家节省数千个车皮来从事别的运输工作。在数以千计的大小工厂中，把从这里运去的生铁轧成了各种钢材，铸成了各种重型机器、电气开关、冲床、车床、刨床……，运到了祖国各个工业建设岗位上去。在安徽的蚌埠、宿县铁工厂和山东农具厂，工人们用马鞍山出产的生铁制成了大批的新式步犁、红芋切片机、水车、抽水机……，运到了辽阔广大的农村，支援着咱们国家的农业生产。此外，这里出产的生铁，还在上海四百多家翻砂工厂里变成了水泥拌和机、自来水管、压路机、加煤机等，运到了城市，支援着市政建设。
    同志们，你们看，从城市到农村，从工业到农业，到处都可以看到马鞍山工人们的劳动成果，他们怎么能不兴奋！现在，他们已经胜利地超额完成了第一季度的国家生产计划，并满怀信心地投入第二季度的生产竞赛。建设马鞍山的人们，保证将以更大的成绩向你们报喜！
