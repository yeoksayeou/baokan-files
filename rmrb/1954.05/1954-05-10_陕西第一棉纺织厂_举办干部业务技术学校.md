    Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill
    Establishes Cadre Business and Technical School
    Of the more than 400 cadres in the Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, with the exception of a small number of engineering and technical personnel, the vast majority of cadres lack scientific knowledge of the textile industry. Although many of the cadres were promoted from among the workers, they only have practical experience and lack or have little theoretical knowledge. As a result, when problems arise in production management, they often cannot be resolved well. Therefore, learning technical and business knowledge has become a relatively common desire among the factory's cadres.
    In view of this situation, the factory's Party committee decided to establish a cadre business and technical school, with the director of the Party committee's Propaganda Department, the administrative secretary, and an engineer serving as president and vice president respectively. A teaching affairs team was established, and engineering and technical personnel were hired as team leaders and technical theory teachers. The personnel department's education section is responsible for learning management, attendance, and performance evaluation. Classes are arranged according to work needs. Workshop cadres are divided into seven classes, such as opening and cleaning, combing and drawing frame, etc., based on different types of work and processes, focusing on learning business and technical knowledge related to the cadres' own work. Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres at the factory level, as well as cadres from various departments, are divided into four classes to study comprehensive textile technical knowledge. The study time is set from 7:00 am to 8:30 am every Tuesday and Wednesday, and it is strictly stipulated that nothing may encroach upon this time to ensure that the learning persists to the end.
    A total of 384 people participated in the study, accounting for 95 percent of the total number of cadres. Since the formal commencement of classes on March 13, good results have been achieved due to the teachers' patient and meticulous explanations and the students' earnest and diligent study. Through learning, cadres have initially understood the performance of machines and other knowledge, and have also understood the specific content of many specialized technical terms. Because the cadres have further mastered business and technical knowledge, their work has begun to change from passive to active, and the management work of various workshops has taken a step forward.

    陕西第一棉纺织厂
    举办干部业务技术学校
    陕西第一棉纺织厂四百多名干部中，除少数工程技术人员外，绝大部分的干部都缺乏纺织工业的科学知识。在干部中虽有不少是从工人中提拔的，但也只有实际经验，而没有或少有理论知识，这样，在生产管理上遇到问题，往往不能很好解决，因此学习技术和业务知识就成为该厂干部比较普遍的愿望。
    根据这种情况，该厂党委决定成立干部业务技术学校，由党委宣传部长、行政秘书和工程师分别担任正、副校长，下设教务组，聘请工程技术人员担任组长和技术理论教员；由人事科教育股负责学习管理、考勤、考绩等事宜。班次是根据工作需要进行编排的，车间干部以工种、工序的不同，分为清花、钢并粗等七个班，重点学习与各个干部本身工作有关的业务、技术知识；厂一级的党、政、工、团及各科室干部则分别编为四个班，进行全面的纺织技术知识的学习。学习时间定为每周二、三早上七时至八时半，严格规定任何事情均不得侵占，以保证学习坚持到底。
    参加学习的共有三百八十四人，占干部总数的百分之九十五。自三月十三日正式上课以来，由于教员们耐心细致的讲解，学员们认真努力的学习，已收到了良好的效果。通过学习使干部初步地懂得了机器的性能等知识，并明白了许多专用技术名词的具体内容。干部们由于进一步掌握了业务和技术知识，工作已开始由被动转为主动，各车间的管理工作向前推进了一步。
