Xinhua News Agency dispatch: With the repeated efforts and multifaceted assistance of the People's Government, the Kazakh people, who had been forced to wander for a long time on the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, have all settled down in the two lush grasslands centered on Haizi in Gansu and Guolimao in Qinghai. They live in harmony with the people of all ethnic groups on the border and are working hard to develop production.

There are fourteen Kazakh tribes, totaling about three thousand people, on the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces. They originally lived in Altay, Barkol, and other places in Xinjiang Province. Before liberation, they successively moved to the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces due to their inability to bear the brutal oppression of the warlord Sheng Shicai. Later, due to the instigation and pursuit of the Ma Bufang bandit gang, Kazakhs and other ethnic groups often engaged in armed conflicts and were forced to wander everywhere, living in poverty for a long time. After the liberation of the Northwest, the People's Governments of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces separately resettled the Kazakh tribes under their jurisdiction. However, due to the rumors, deceptions, and threats of the American imperialist spy Osman Batur and others, they left the People's Government and lived a nomadic life. In the spring of 1951, with the assistance of the people of all ethnic groups, the People's Liberation Army captured the bandit leader Osman Batur and others on the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, and resettled the Kazakh people who had been deceived by Osman Batur, helping them solve the difficulties in production and life. However, due to the deceptive propaganda of bandits and special agents, most people were still afraid to approach the People's Government and continued to live a nomadic life.

In June and July 1952, the People's Government invited their relatives, friends, and representatives of Kazakhs who had been resettled in Xinjiang, as well as activists, to go deep into the pastoral areas and write letters to explain the ethnic policies of the People's Government to them. From August to December of the same year, under the guidance of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and the Hami Commissioner's Office, the Jiuquan Commissioner's Office and the Dunhuang County People's Government of Gansu Province, and the Qinghai Provincial People's Government and the former Dulan Autonomous Region People's Government and other agencies, successively organized working groups or selected cadres to go deep into the areas inhabited by the Kazakhs, and explained the ethnic policies of the People's Government to them through various forms. The cordial care and consideration of the People's Government made them begin to feel the warmth of the motherland's big family. They sent representatives to contact the People's Government, expressing their willingness to accept the leadership of the People's Government. Subsequently, the People's Government invited Kazakh headmen to a forum to solicit their opinions and understand the difficulties of the Kazakh people, and helped them solve their living difficulties; helped them bring more than 100 family members living in Xinjiang to the border area; some of them also visited the production and living conditions of the Kazakhs in Xinjiang. Therefore, they eliminated their worries and all returned to the embrace of the motherland.

In order to further strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups on the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang and properly resettle the Kazakh people, in March 1953, the Northwest Administrative Committee convened a joint conference of Kazakh headmen and an ethnic unity conference on the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang in Lanzhou. The meeting unanimously adopted an agreement on strengthening ethnic unity and resettling the Kazakhs. After the meeting, the local People's Government actively led and assisted the people of all ethnic groups in implementing the agreement. The Northwest Administrative Committee also organized a delegation of various ethnic groups from the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang to go deep into pastoral yurts to publicize the policy of ethnic equality and unity, and helped them establish the preparatory committees for the Aksay and Araltung Quruk Autonomous Regions.

Now, the Kazakh areas on the borders of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces are showing a new atmosphere of unity and friendship everywhere. Under the care and assistance of the People's Government and the people of all ethnic groups, the Kazakh people on the border are beginning to live a stable and happy life, and are working hard to develop animal husbandry production.

From April 20th to 26th, the People's Representative Conference of the Aksay Kazakh Autonomous Region on the border of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang was held in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province. The meeting exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and officially established the People's Government of the Aksay Kazakh Autonomous Region. During the meeting, Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, attended the meeting and gave important instructions. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Gansu Provincial People's Government, the Jiuquan Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Jiuquan Commissioner's Office, and more than 30 other units, including various organs, organizations, and stationed troops, also sent representatives to participate in the meeting or sent gifts to congratulate it. The meeting also adopted resolutions such as the establishment of four township-level political power organizations by the Autonomous Region People's Government, and a letter of salute to Chairman Mao.

    甘青新边境哈萨克族人民得到妥善安置
    阿克塞哈萨克族自治区人民政府已成立
    据新华社讯：被迫长期流散在甘肃、青海、新疆三省边境的哈萨克族人民，在人民政府的反复争取和多方帮助下，已全部在以甘肃海子和青海郭里峁为中心的两个水草丰美的草原上安居下来，和边境各族人民和睦共处，努力发展生产。
    甘、青、新三省边境的哈族共有十四个部落，约三千人。他们原来居住在新疆省阿勒泰、巴里坤等地，解放前由于不堪盛匪世才的残酷压迫，陆续迁到甘、青、新三省边境居住。后来，又因为马匪步芳的挑拨和追杀，使哈族和其他各族经常发生械斗，并被迫到处流窜，长期过着贫困的生活。西北解放后，甘肃、青海、新疆三省人民政府曾分别安置了所辖地区的哈族部落。但由于美帝国主义间谍乌斯满等造谣欺骗和威胁，他们又离开人民政府，过着流浪的生活。一九五一年春，人民解放军在各族人民的协助下，在甘、青、新三省边境生擒了匪首乌斯满等，而对受乌斯满欺骗的哈族人民则分别予以安置，帮助他们解决了生产和生活方面的困难问题。但因受土匪特务的欺骗宣传，大部分人仍不敢接近人民政府，继续过着流浪的生活。
    一九五二年六、七月间，人民政府曾邀请他们在新疆的亲戚、朋友和已安置的哈族中的代表人物及积极分子，深入牧区和写信向他们解释人民政府的民族政策。同年八月到十二月，在中共中央西北局的指示下，新疆省人民政府和哈密专员公署，甘肃省酒泉专员公署和敦煌县人民政府，青海省人民政府和原都兰自治区人民政府等机关，都先后组织工作团或选派干部，深入哈族居住地区，通过各种形式给他们宣传解释人民政府的民族政策。人民政府对他们的亲切关怀和照顾，使他们开始感到祖国大家庭的温暖，他们派代表到人民政府接洽，表示愿意接受人民政府的领导。接着，人民政府邀请哈族头人座谈，征求他们的意见和了解哈族人民的困难，并帮助他们解决生活上的困难问题；帮助他们把住在新疆的一百多家属接到边境上来；他们中有的人还去参观了新疆哈族的生产和生活情况。因此，他们才消除顾虑，全部投回到祖国的怀抱。
    为进一步加强甘、青、新边境各民族的团结和妥善安置哈族人民，一九五三年三月，西北行政委员会在兰州召开了甘、青、新边境哈族头人联谊会及各族团结会。会议一致通过了关于加强民族团结和安置哈族的协议意见。会后，当地人民政府就积极领导和协助各族人民执行协议。西北行政委员会还组织了甘、青、新三省边境各族访问团，深入牧区帐篷，宣传民族平等团结政策，并帮助他们成立了阿克塞和阿尔顿曲克两个自治区筹备委员会。
    现在，甘、青、新三省边境哈族地区，到处都呈现着团结友爱的新气象。在人民政府和各族人民的关怀和帮助下，边境哈族人民开始过着安定愉快的生活，努力发展畜牧业生产。
    四月二十日到二十六日，甘肃、青海、新疆边境阿克塞哈萨克族自治区人民代表会议在甘肃省敦煌县举行。会议代行人民代表大会职权，正式成立了阿克塞哈萨克族自治区人民政府。会议期间，西北行政委员会副主席杨明轩到会作了重要指示。中共甘肃省委员会，甘肃省人民政府，中共酒泉地方委员会，酒泉专员公署及其他各机关、团体、驻军等三十多个单位，也都派代表参加了会议或送礼品祝贺。会议还通过了自治区人民政府建立四个乡的政权组织等项决议和向毛主席的致敬电。
