Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th. Jiangsu Province farmers, following the state plan, are expanding cotton fields while focusing on increasing yield per unit area. Currently, the planting of cotton on over ten million mu of land in the province has basically concluded. Preliminary statistics indicate that cotton fields have been expanded by nearly one million mu compared to last year. The renowned Nantong cotton region planted 2.93 million mu of cotton last year, which has increased to 3.52 million mu this year. Farmers in Dafeng County reclaimed saline-alkali wasteland and converted low-yield grain fields to cotton, expanding cotton fields by a total of 208,000 mu. Farmers in various cotton-producing areas are also actively tapping potential to increase cotton yield per unit area. In Jiading County, Songjiang Special District, which had the lowest cotton yield, most of the more than 250,000 mu of cotton fields have been converted to the superior Dai-character cotton variety, which is expected to increase cotton production by more than 5 million jin this year compared to last year. Cotton farmers in Xuzhou, Huaiyin and other special districts have changed their habit of sparse planting and are implementing appropriately dense planting. Farmers in the coastal areas of Yancheng Special District, to adapt to the salinity in the soil and the slow germination of cotton seeds, generally advanced the cotton planting period by about a week. Currently, the early-planted cotton seedlings in various places have grown four true leaves, and farmers are preparing to carry out thinning, weeding, and earthing up, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th. Farmers in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province have overfulfilled their cotton planting plans. According to recent statistics from twenty-seven counties including Yuncheng, Linfen, Jie County, and Hongdong, more than 2,885,300 mu of cotton fields have been sown, exceeding the plan by 3 percent. Among them, seventeen counties have expanded cotton fields by 8.5 percent compared to last year. Currently, the earlier-sown cotton seedlings have grown to more than one inch tall. In order to promote the good growth of cotton seedlings and strive to increase yield per unit area, farmers in various places are carrying out activities such as soil loosening, seedling inspection, seedling replacement, drought resistance, frost prevention, and pest control to ensure full stands.

Shanxi Province is one of the major cotton-producing areas in the country, and the cotton field area in the southern region accounts for about 72 percent of the total cotton field area in the province. During the cotton planting season since early April, drought conditions gradually appeared in the southern region. Agricultural production cooperatives in various places led and helped mutual aid groups and individual farmers to widely carry out drought-resistant cotton planting campaigns under the slogan of "Increasing cotton production to ensure ample raw materials for the country's industry." The county people's governments dispatched a total of more than 200 technical personnel and administrative cadres to help and promote cotton planting by farmers. State-owned farms and agricultural technology promotion work base stations in various places also convened symposiums for farmers in surrounding villages to impart advanced cotton planting techniques. In addition to shipping in large quantities of grain, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative promptly transferred more than 1,500 waterwheels, more than 2,000 other farm implements, more than 36 million jin of bean cake and various chemical fertilizers, and more than 75,000 jin of pesticides. The local people's governments also helped farmers exchange more than 1.5 million jin of cotton seeds.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 17th. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the cotton-producing areas of Guizhou Province are diligently planting cotton in accordance with the state plan. The planting in more than twenty counties with warmer climates such as Ceheng and Wangmo has basically ended, and the cotton seedlings have begun to emerge.

Before planting, various cotton-producing areas summarized and promoted some advanced cotton planting experiences. In the past, most cotton-producing counties in the Xingyi Special District broadcast seeds and cultivated the land roughly. This year, most cotton fields have been converted to spot sowing and base fertilizer has been applied. The Shibing County Cotton Experiment Farm promoted more than 20,000 jin of the superior cotton variety "Qian Nong 465" to Zhenyuan, Sinan, Tianzhu, Cengong and other counties and the Miao Autonomous Region of Taijiang County. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties have also prepared large quantities of "666" pesticide powder to supply cotton farmers for pest control.

More than fifty counties in Guizhou Province are suitable for cotton cultivation. This year, in accordance with the needs of the state and local conditions, the province expects to expand cotton fields by 11 percent compared to last year and strive to increase cotton production by 16 percent.

    江苏全省一千多万亩棉花播种基本结束
    山西省南部和贵州省产棉区扩大棉田
    【新华社南京十七日电】江苏省农民按照国家计划，在扩大棉田的同时注意提高单位面积产量。目前全省一千多万亩棉花播种已基本结束，据初步统计比去年扩大棉田近一百万亩。著名的南通棉区去年植棉二百九十三万亩，今年增加到三百五十二万亩。大丰县农民开垦盐碱荒地，把低产量粮田改种棉花，共扩大棉田二十万八千亩。各产棉区农民还积极挖掘潜力，提高棉花的单位面积产量。松江专区棉花产量最低的嘉定县，二十五万多亩棉田已大部改种岱字棉良种，预计今年将比去年增产棉花五百多万斤。徐州、淮阴等专区植棉农民纷纷改变稀植的习惯，实行适当密植。盐城专区沿海地区农民为适应土壤中含有盐分，棉种发芽较慢的情况，普遍提早棉花播种期一星期左右。目前各地棉苗早种的已放四个真叶，农民正准备进行间苗、锄草和壅土等。
    【新华社太原十六日电】山西省南部产棉区农民已超额完成植棉计划。据运城、临汾、解县、洪洞等二十七个县最近的统计，已下种的棉田达二百八十八万五千三百多亩，超过计划百分之三。其中有十七个县比去年扩大棉田百分之八点五。目前，下种较早的棉苗已长到一寸多高。为了促进棉苗的良好生长，争取提高单位面积产量，各地农民正进行松土、查苗、补苗、抗旱、防冻、治虫等活动，以保证全苗。
    山西省是全国主要产棉区之一，南部地区的棉田面积约占全省棉田总面积的百分之七十二。四月上旬以来的棉花播种季节里，南部地区逐渐呈现旱象。各地农业生产合作社带动并帮助互助组和个体农民，在“增产棉花保证供应国家工业充足原料”的口号下，普遍开展了抗旱种棉运动。各县人民政府共派出技术人员和行政干部二百多人，帮助和推动农民种棉。各地国营农场和农业技术推广工作基点站也都召集周围村子的农民举行座谈会，传授先进的植棉技术。各地除源源运到大批粮食外，山西省供销合作社并及时调去水车一千五百多部、其他农具二千多件、豆饼和各种化学肥料三千六百多万斤以及农药七万五千多斤。当地人民政府还帮助农民换棉种一百五十多万斤。
    【新华社贵阳十七日电】贵州省产棉区各族农民正按照国家计划，紧张播种棉花。气候较热的册亨、望谟等二十多个县播种已基本结束，棉苗已开始出土。
    播种前，各产棉区都总结和推广了一些先进植棉经验。兴义专区各产棉县过去大多是撒播，耕作也很粗糙，今年大部棉田改为点播，并施了底肥。施秉县棉作试验场向镇远、思南、天柱、岑巩等县和台江县苗族自治区推广了两万多斤“黔农四六五”优良棉种。各县供销合作社还准备了大批“六六六”药粉，供应植棉农民防治虫害。
    贵州省有五十多个县适宜种棉。今年全省按照国家需要和当地可能条件，预计将比去年扩大棉田百分之十一，争取增产棉花百分之十六。
