A Letter from Afar

A few days ago, the Beijing Gardening Department received a small package and a letter sent by military mail. On the bottom of the package and envelope were neatly written the words: "Sent from Weihaiwei, Shandong." The cadres of the Gardening Department opened the package and found that it contained some brown seeds. Upon reading the letter, they learned that the seeds were sent by Zhang Tiancun, a naval soldier stationed in faraway Weihaiwei. In his letter, he enthusiastically said: "This flower grows on the island where we live. Once planted, it doesn't need artificial cultivation and blooms yellow flowers every year. Beijing might not have this kind of flower, please plant more of it along the roadsides and lakesides. The capital is beautiful, we want to make the capital even more beautiful."

The Beijing Gardening Department, which is responsible for greening the capital, often receives letters from all over the country. The letter from naval soldier Zhang Tiancun is just one of them. Some of these letters inquire about the construction of Beijing with concern, some offer enthusiastic suggestions about the capital's construction. Some even send seeds of various exotic flowers and plants. The people living in the capital are equally concerned about the construction of the capital. Not long ago, when the Gardening Department planted saplings in the Temple of Heaven Nursery, soldiers, university students, and Young Pioneers in the capital rushed to help plant them in their spare time. During the tree planting, the Gardening Department gave fewer tools to the Young Pioneers because they were young, and asked them to take turns to rest. Who knew that the "Red Scarves" who didn't get tools were angry because of this? They pouted and ran to the office to question why they weren't given tools. The various departments directly under the Military Commission sent 400 cadres, and in just three days they planted all 143,800 trees that were originally scheduled to be planted in a week. They refused to rest even on rainy days. Some people had blisters on their hands and their shoulders were swollen by the carrying poles, but they still kept working hard. They said: Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are here, Beijing is the beacon of the Eastern people, and a place yearned for by the oppressed working people all over the world, we must build her as beautiful as a garden. The People's Liberation Army soldiers who helped work in the Xijiao Nursery also wrote what was in their hearts on the blackboard:

"We want to build the people's capital - the ancient and magnificent city of Beijing - even more beautiful, so that she is covered in evergreen attire, and that the flowers of peace will bloom forever."

A Beautiful Greened City

Beijing is a famous green city, with green shade covering the streets, and the whole city is shaded in a sea of trees. Beijing is also the city with the most historical sites and parks. In the urban area, there is the Palace Museum, the crystallization of the art of the working people of all generations; the Temple of Heaven, a world-famous ancient building; Beihai Park with its rippling blue waters and towering white pagoda; Zhongshan Park and the Working People's Cultural Palace with ancient cypresses lining the roads and dense shade; in the suburbs, there is the Xijiao Park, which raises various rare and exotic animals; the Summer Palace with its beautiful mountains and rivers; and the elegant scenery of the Western Hills... In order to adapt to the increasing population of the urban area, many new parks have been built in recent years. In particular, many new parks have been built in areas where the working people live. Now, people living in the northern city, if they want to take their children out to play on Sundays, do not have to run a long way as before. They can go to the newly built Children's Park in Shichahai, where there are slides, swings, and wooden horses. Adults can also go boating. The joy of the working people living near Taoranting is even greater. A few years ago, this place was still a wasteland of graves and stagnant water pits. Now, Taoranting has become a garden, with several small hills surrounding a pool of green water. Pink roses, pagoda trees from Jiangnan and white crabapples dot the lakeside and hillside. Here, people can see workers from nearby factories taking their children and loved ones sitting on the green grass or under the flower sheds chatting, young mothers pushing strollers with babies strolling on the newly paved pebble roads. You can also see the active "Red Scarves", holding high the team flag fluttering in the wind, coming here to spend team days. Soon, an open-air dance floor that can accommodate 800 people will be built in the park, and then people can dance lightly on the smooth brick floor. The Longtan next to the Temple of Heaven was originally a stagnant pool, but now it has become living water, the banks are neatly repaired, and the newly planted saplings on the shore have already sprouted tender buds. In the evening, workers living nearby often stroll along the lake. In the Zizhuyuan in the western suburbs, after the bottom of the lake was deepened last year, more than 2,700 flowers and trees such as pine, cypress, peach, apricot, orchid, and iris were planted. Students from the Nationalities Institute often love to sit under the trees by the lake to read. On Sundays, many middle school students from the city come here for holidays. In addition to taking pictures on the small red bridge, people also like to run to the top of the small hill to look at some of the tall new buildings nearby.

Even More Beautiful in the Future

Beijing is becoming more and more beautiful, but these new constructions are just the beginning, and it will be built even more beautifully in the future. The responsible cadre of the Gardening Department pointed to a map of Beijing hanging on the wall and said that in the future, each district will have a large park, and small recreational parks and children's parks will be all over the city. He said that the nursery for Beijing's greening needs has been expanded to 1,600 mu last year, and this year it is planned to expand it to 4,400 mu. The variety of seedlings has also increased from more than 60 to more than 250. In order to collect seeds, the cadres of the Gardening Department have traveled to many places. Precious saplings from Hangzhou, Suzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Nanjing have been collected and planted in the nursery. Currently, there are several cadres in the Northeast busy selecting and collecting cold-resistant saplings.

When the saplings in the nursery grow up, the factories in the suburbs of Beijing will be decorated with these trees like lace, so that the thick smoke from the factory chimneys will rarely be blown to the city center, and the city area will be kept clean and tidy. In the Western Hills, millions of spruces, oil pines, oriental arborvitae, locusts, smoke trees, maple trees, mountain peaches, and mountain apricots will be planted. These trees will stand on the Western Hills like a green Great Wall, blocking the wind and sand blowing from the northwest. On both sides of the Yongding River, two green wind and sand prevention forest belts will also be built with trees. By that time, Beijing's spring will not be as frequently invaded by wind and sand as it is now. After the Guanting Reservoir is built, the moat that runs across the city will become living water after being diverted, and there will be a constant stream of遊船遊船 drifting along with the green waves. After the old waterway between Beijing and Tianjin is restored in the future, it will add a good place for tourists to relax, and the two banks of the river will be decorated with green poplars and weeping willows. If anyone has not seen the sea, they can take a steamer from Beijing to Tianjin and sail to the Bohai Sea. When the weather is hot, if you want to spend a Sunday at the Summer Palace, you don't have to go to Xizhimen to wait for the bus. People can take a yacht from the Sanhai in the city through Zizhuyuan to the Summer Palace. Along the way, you can sit quietly in the boat and watch the scenery along the way. In the future, the road surface of Beijing's roads will be much wider than the current East and West Chang'an Avenue, and the tree-lined roads on both sides will become roadside parks. In spring, the elm leaf plum, peach blossom, Kerria japonica, monthly flowers and lilac flowers on the roadside bloom with bright flowers for people to enjoy. In summer, when people are busy all day, when they walk to the side of the road in the evening, the hibiscus trees, oak trees, pagoda trees from Jiangnan and rose of Sharon bushes on the roadside emit a refreshing fragrance, and a breeze blows away the fatigue of the day. In autumn, the leaves of the Acer truncatum and Chinese pistache on the roadside grow redder and redder, and the branches of persimmons, crabapples and red fruit and Kerria japonica will also be covered with red fruits. In winter, when the snow covers the ground, the pink plum blossoms and yellow wintersweet stand proudly on the steps of the roadside buildings with their shy colors. These long-leaved trees, flowering trees, and fruiting trees alternately complement the neat and magnificent buildings of the capital throughout the year, depicting different magnificent pictures. When people stand on the roof of the office building and look far down, the entire city of Beijing will not only be a green sea of ​​trees, but will be like a brocade with various bright colors.

This solemn and magnificent picture will be presented to the people of the capital, and to the people of the whole country through hard work. Let us move towards this vision! (Attached picture)

    把北京建设得更加壮丽吧
    傅冬
    远方的来信
    前些天，北京园林处收到一个用军邮寄来的小包裹和一封信。包裹和信封的下方都端端正正地写着这样几个字：“山东威海卫寄”。园林处的干部打开包裹一看，原来是些褐色的种子。再一看信，才知道那是守卫在遥远的威海卫的海军战士张天存寄来的花种。他在信上热情地说：“这花生长在我们住的海岛上，种了以后，不需要人工培养，年年开放黄色的花朵。北京可能没有这种花，请多多在公路边和湖畔栽种。首都很美丽，我们要使首都更加美丽。”
    负责绿化首都的北京园林处，经常收到来自全国各地的书信。海军战士张天存的来信只不过是其中的一封。这些书信，有的关切地询问北京的建设情况，有的热情地提出关于首都建设的建议。有的还寄来各种各样的异花奇草的种子。生活在首都的人们，同样关怀着首都的建设。不久前，园林处在天坛苗圃栽植树苗，首都的战士、大学生和少先队员争着抢着在业余时间帮助种植。在植树中，园林处因少先队员年岁小，就少给了一些工具，让他们轮流休息。那知道分不到工具的“红领巾”却因此生气了，他们噘着嘴跑到办公室去质问为什么不给他们工具？军委各直属机关派来四百个干部，只三天就把原订一个星期才能种完的十四万三千八百多株树统统种完了。下雨天，他们都不肯休息，有些人手上打了泡，肩上被扁担压肿了，还是一个劲地干。他们说：北京是中华人民共和国的首都，党中央和毛主席都在这儿，北京是东方人民的灯塔，是全世界被压迫的劳动人民所向往的地方，我们要把她建设得像花园一样的美丽。在西郊苗圃帮助工作的解放军战士，也在黑板上写出了他们心底的话：
  “我们要把人民的首都——古老壮丽的北京城建设得更加美丽，使她披上常年青绿的盛装，使那和平的花朵永开不谢。”
    美丽的绿化城
    北京，是有名的绿化城市，绿荫笼罩着一条条的街道，全城掩映在一片树海里。北京，也是名胜古迹和公园最多的城市，在城区，有历代劳动人民艺术的结晶——故宫博物院，有驰名世界的古代建筑——天坛，有碧波荡漾、白塔耸立的北海公园，有古柏夹道、浓荫蔽日的中山公园和劳动人民文化宫；在郊区，有豢养各种珍奇动物的西郊公园，有山水秀丽的颐和园，有风景幽雅的西山……。为了适应市区人口日益增加的需要，年来又建设了许多新的公园。特别是在劳动人民聚居的地方新建了不少公园。现在住在北城的人，星期天如果想带孩子出来玩，不必像以前一样跑很远的路了，他们可以到什刹海逛新修的儿童公园去，那儿有滑梯、秋千、木马。大人还可以划船。住在陶然亭附近的劳动人民的欢喜劲儿就更不用提了，前几年，这地方还是一片荒坟和死水坑，现在陶然亭已变成了一个花园，几座小山环抱着一池碧绿的湖水，粉红色的玫瑰、江南槐和白色的白玉棠点缀在湖边和山腰。在这里，人们在假日可以看见附近工厂的工人带着孩子和爱人坐在绿茵茵的草地上或花棚下谈天，可以看见年轻的母亲推着载着婴儿的小车在新铺的豆石路上散步。也可以看见活跃的“红领巾”们，举着迎风招展的队旗，来这里过队日。不久，园里还要建造一个能容八百人的露天舞场，那时，人们就可以在那光滑的花砖地上轻快地跳舞。天坛旁边的龙潭原来也是个死水池，现也变成了活水，堤岸修得平平整整，岸上新栽的小树，已经吐出了嫩芽。傍晚，住在附近的工人常沿着湖边漫步。西郊的紫竹院，去年挖深了湖底后，又栽植了松、柏、桃、杏、兰芝等两千七百多株花木。民族学院的学生常爱坐在湖边的树下读书。星期天也有不少城里的中学生来这儿度假日，人们除爱在那红色的小长桥拍照外，还喜欢跑到那小山顶顶上望一望附近新盖的一些高大的楼房。
    将来还要更美丽
    北京是越来越美丽了，但这些新的修建，不过是个开始，将来还要建设得更加美丽。园林处的负责干部指着挂在墙上的一张北京市地图说，将来每个区都有一个大公园，小型的游憩公园和儿童公园将布满全城。他说，供北京绿化需要的苗圃去年已经扩充到一千六百亩，今年计划把它扩展到四千四百亩。苗株的品种也由六十多种增添到二百五十多种。为了采集种子，园林处的干部跑了很多地方。杭州、苏州、青岛、上海、南京的名贵的树苗都已采来种在苗圃里，目前还有几个干部在东北忙着选采耐寒的树苗。
    当苗圃里的树苗长大以后，北京城郊的工厂就一个个都要用这些树像花边似的给镶起来，这样，工厂烟囱里的浓烟，就很少被风吹到市中心，市区将经常保持干净清洁。在西山，将要种上千千万万棵云杉、油松、侧柏、洋槐、黄栌、元宝枫和山桃、山杏，这些树将像一条绿的长城耸立在西山上，挡住从西北刮来的风沙。在永定河的两岸，也用树筑起两道绿色的防风防砂林带，到那个时候，北京市的春天就不会像现在这样经常遭受风沙的侵袭了。横贯全城的护城河在官厅水库修好后，经过引水就变成了活水，河里将不断地有游船随着绿波荡漾。京津之间的旧河道将来恢复后，又给游人增加了一个游憩的好场所，河的两岸，也都要用绿杨树、垂柳装饰起来。假如谁没有见过大海，就可以坐上从北京到天津的汽船，到渤海去航行。天热的时候，如果想到颐和园去过一个星期日，那时就不一定要去西直门等汽车，人们可以从城里的三海坐上游艇经过紫竹院直至颐和园，一路上可以静坐船中观赏沿途的景色。将来北京的马路路面比现在的东西长安街还要宽许多，两旁的林荫道都将变成路边公园，春天，路边的榆叶梅、碧桃、黄刺梅、月季花和丁香开出鲜艳的花朵供人欣赏。夏天，当人们忙了一天，傍晚走到马路边散步时，路旁的蓉花树、栎树、江南槐和木槿树丛中发出一种令人心旷神怡的香味，微风一吹，一天的疲劳都洗刷干净了。秋天，路边的元宝枫、楷树的叶子越长越红，而柿子、海棠和红果、黄刺梅的树梢上，也将挂满红艳艳的果实。冬天，当大雪把地面盖起来的时候，粉红色的梅花和黄色的腊梅却带着羞嫩的颜色兀立路边大楼的阶前。这些长叶的树，开花的树，结果的树，一年四季，轮流地陪衬着首都整齐壮丽的建筑，描成了不同的瑰丽的画面。当人们站在办公室大楼的屋顶上，远远望下去，整个北京城将不仅是一片绿的树海，而将像一片具有各种鲜艳色彩的织锦。
    这幅庄严壮丽的图画，经过辛勤的劳动，将会呈现在首都人民的面前，呈现在全国人民的面前，让我们向着这个远景迈进吧！（附图片）
