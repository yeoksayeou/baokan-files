Mianchi County, Henan Province, Actively Waters and Fertilizes to Rescue Frozen Wheat

Mianchi County, Henan Province, launched a watering and fertilizing campaign, rescuing 250,000 mu of wheat that had suffered from frost damage.

Around April 20th, Mianchi County, Henan Province, suffered relatively severe frost damage, affecting 300,000 mu of wheat fields. After the frost, the Mianchi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately studied the disaster situation and its characteristics, and decided to launch a mass watering and fertilizing campaign to rescue the wheat. Members of the county and district committees went to various villages to help township and village cadres hold various meetings and organize the masses to participate in the wheat rescue movement. By the end of April, the county-wide wheat seedling rescue movement had reached a climax. Farmers in four disaster-stricken townships in the Second District repaired seven canals and dug six earthen wells within three days, watering more than 230 mu of wheat. As of early May, the county had rescued more than 250,000 mu of wheat. It is estimated that the severely affected wheat will not have a major impact on the harvest.

While rescuing the wheat, the county also mobilized the masses to plant early-maturing crops and vegetables. According to statistics from four townships in the Second District, more than 73,000 pumpkin seedlings were planted. According to incomplete statistics from various districts, more than 3,000 mu of other early-maturing crops were planted on vacant land.

    河南省渑池县积极浇水追肥抢救受冻小麦
    河南省渑池县开展浇水、追肥运动，抢救了遭受霜灾小麦二十五万亩。
    四月二十日前后，河南省渑池县遭受较重霜灾，受害麦田达三十万亩。霜后，中共渑池县委立即研究了受灾情况和受灾特点，决定开展群众性的浇水、追肥运动，抢救小麦。县委和区委的委员，都分头深入各乡村帮助乡、村干部召开各种会议，组织群众参加救麦运动。到四月底，全县抢救麦苗运动进入高潮，二区四个受灾乡的农民，在三天内就修渠七道。打土井六眼，浇麦二百三十多亩。到五月上旬止，全县已抢救了二十五万多亩小麦。受灾严重的小麦，估计对收成影响不大。
    在抢救小麦的同时，该县还动员群众种植早熟作物和蔬菜。据二区的四个乡统计，种南瓜七万三千多窝。另据各区不完全统计，还利用空地种了三千多亩其他早熟作物。
