	How I Learn to Conduct Political and Ideological Work Among Technical Personnel
	Ma Xingwang, Secretary of the Class A Branch of the Iron Smelting Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

	I was originally a blast furnace worker. In August 1952, I began serving as a branch committee member and chairman of the trade union in the workshop, and later as the branch secretary.
 
	When I started doing Party and trade union work, I didn't conduct any political and ideological work among the technical personnel at all. At that time, I had many wrong ideas about the technical personnel. The higher Party committee told us that technical personnel were part of the working class and that we should unite with them to improve production. I thought, how can you say they are the working class? Most of these people came from landlord and capitalist families, and what they said and did was nothing like the workers. I especially disliked how clean they were, peeling their steamed buns, and not eating until they washed their hands and faces after work. When I was a worker, I once had half a bowl of water left over after drinking, and a technician wanted to drink water. He picked it up, poured out the water, and even washed the bowl again, as if we workers would make the bowl dirty by drinking from it. Besides, how could I, such a roughneck, conduct political and ideological work among college students? They learn more in a day of reading than we do in a month of study. If I said something wrong to them, and they seized on it and questioned me, it would be so embarrassing.
 
	However, the Party committee of the Iron Smelting Plant was very strict in grasping the work of technical personnel. Not long after I became the chairman of the trade union, the Party wanted us to mobilize the technical personnel to participate in competitions. This stumped me. Every day, I thought about what to say when I went to work, planning to talk to the technical personnel, but as soon as I stepped onto the blast furnace platform and saw the technicians, I would forget what I had planned to say. I couldn't do the work, so I naturally got criticized, which made me worried and helpless.
 
	One day, shift leader Zeng Xinrong talked to me about this issue. Zeng Xinrong was a very progressive technical person. He was a technician when I was a worker in the past. At that time, he patiently taught me techniques, and we had a good relationship. So, I told him all my troubles. He immediately pointed out my mistakes, saying that I underestimated the technical personnel. He told me that although the technical personnel had shortcomings, many of them wanted to make progress and were willing to receive the Party's help. He also expressed his willingness to help me do this work well.
 
	Soon, the No. 1 blast furnace had problems with its operation and produced several batches of substandard iron (iron that did not meet national standards). The technician in charge of this blast furnace was concerned about saving face and refused to admit his mistake to everyone. The workers were very dissatisfied with him. The relationship between the two sides was getting worse and worse, and the technician was feeling emotional and preparing to quit. Zeng Xinrong helped me solve this problem. He first helped me analyze the technical reasons for the substandard iron. Once I had a clear understanding, I went to talk to the technician. At first, he refused to admit his mistake. However, after I patiently pointed out the reasons for the substandard iron and told him how he should deal with mistakes, his attitude changed. Later, the branch secretary and Zeng Xinrong talked to him separately. A few days later, the No. 1 blast furnace produced substandard iron again, and before we could say anything, he took the initiative to apologize to the workers, who were very satisfied. At this time, I realized that the technical personnel really wanted to make progress, so I was no longer so afraid of talking to them.
 
	The Party committee gave us a lot of help and support at the grassroots level. The Party committee often analyzed and criticized our wrong understanding of the technical personnel and our concerns about not daring to conduct political and ideological work among them, and specifically taught us methods. At that time, some technical personnel looked down on us grassroots cadres. When they had problems, they always went directly to the Party committee instead of coming to us. In order to train grassroots cadres and enhance their prestige, the Party committee generally did not directly solve their problems, but asked them to come to the branch. If we didn't do a good job, the Party committee would come to help us. In this way, I slowly dared to take the initiative to conduct political and ideological work among the technical personnel, and I also initially grasped some methods.
 
	I feel that to do a good job in the political and ideological work of the technical personnel, we must rely on the active elements among the technical personnel. A Party cadre cannot rely solely on himself to do any work. But I didn't understand this at the beginning, because I felt that the technical personnel were all backward. Zeng Xinrong played a big role in the transformation of the technician of the No. 1 blast furnace. Later, I gradually paid attention to this point. Now there are already several active technical personnel in our class. When we understand the ideological situation of the technical personnel, especially when we encounter some technical problems, we all consult with the active elements among the technical personnel and assign them tasks. We also absorb the active elements among the technical personnel to attend the enlarged branch committee meetings to discuss the national plan. They can complete the work assigned by the Party seriously and report to the Party in a timely manner. They are very happy when they are assigned work, feeling that this is the Party's trust in them and their glory. These active elements play a big role in the Party's work. Some things are easier for them to explain to other technical personnel than for our Party and trade union cadres. Because the technical personnel are more likely to believe the words of the technical personnel; at the same time, their understanding of the ideological situation of the technical personnel is often more in-depth and specific than ours. Our Party and trade union cadres have low technical levels and need their help very much. If Zeng Xinrong hadn't told me the technical reasons for the substandard iron of the No. 1 blast furnace, it is very likely that the technician would not have admitted his mistake, and it would have been difficult for me to carry out my work. We cannot just use the active elements among the technical personnel, but we must also constantly help them and improve them. In this way, we can meet their demands for progress and better play their role.
 
	We also pay attention to understanding the technical personnel's ideological and work situation from all aspects. For example, if we want to study the ideological and work problems of a shift technician, we need to ask the shift leader, the gas worker, and the active Party members among the furnace workers, etc., people who have a work relationship with him from top to bottom, left and right, to solicit their opinions. It's easy to handle things once you understand the problem clearly. When we implemented the system of the chief engineer's responsibility last winter, we helped the shift leader establish his prestige in this way. The shift leader had to report on his leadership work to everyone, so the branch first convened a meeting of active workers and a meeting of administrative team leaders to let them give opinions on the shift leader, and also separately solicited the opinions and requirements of some active technicians for the shift leader. The branch analyzed and studied these opinions, sorted them out, and handed them over to the shift leader. As a result, the shift leader made a very good examination, and the masses were very satisfied. His prestige was higher than before. The shift leader happily said to me: "Your branch's method is really good. Can it also be promoted in other branches?" In fact, the branches of our several classes are doing the same thing.
 
	We must often give help to the technical personnel, especially when they encounter difficulties and problems in production, we must help them find solutions. Once, the No. 8 blast furnace had continuous accidents, and the workers were dissatisfied with the technicians, and the technicians were criticized by the factory director. The branch decided to help the technicians come up with solutions. When I went to the dormitory to talk to the technicians, the technicians had not yet figured out the reasons for the accidents and the dissatisfaction of the workers. Because the branch had already held two small-scale meetings of active Party members, we had a good grasp of the situation. I patiently helped him conduct an in-depth analysis, so that he realized his mistakes in not listening to the opinions of the masses and having excessive demands and impatient attitudes towards the masses. Our conversation was very harmonious and cordial. The technicians also wanted to make progress. As soon as he found his own problems, he immediately came up with ways to overcome them. He made a very profound self-criticism to the masses. Later, his relationship with the workers became very good, and production also improved. We often do this kind of work.
 
	We must be more approachable to the technical personnel in life. We often go to their dormitories to find them, sometimes to talk about problems, sometimes just to chat. Not long ago, because production was not good, two technicians in our class were criticized at a forum for technical personnel convened by the Party committee. I quickly went to the dormitory to see them, asking them if they had any opinions, if there were any difficulties in their work, and to see if their emotions were fluctuating. Everyone is often close to each other, and the estrangement will slowly disappear. When they feel that we no longer treat them as "outsiders," they can naturally talk to us about their inner thoughts. Some technicians once told me that they used to be willing to talk about their own problems, but they were unwilling to involve others, for fear that others would talk behind their backs if they knew about it; some technicians suggested to us that we should not always treat them like coaxing children, and that if there was anything wrong, we should criticize them strictly. Once we understand their thoughts and requirements, the work will be easier to do.
 
	From more than a year of work, I deeply feel that to do a good job in the political and ideological work of the technical personnel, we must first correct some of our wrong views of the technical personnel. When I slowly realized my past mistakes, I felt that the root cause of why I didn't do a good job in the past lay here. The Party has stipulated policies, requiring us to earnestly unite and transform the technical personnel, but I did not study the Party's policies well, and I did not act in accordance with the Party's policies. I still look at the technical personnel with the eyes of the old society, and I did not distinguish clearly that they are no longer serving the capitalists, but working to improve our socialist enterprises. I even regard the unhygienic habits that workers in the old society developed because of the capitalists' cruel exploitation as very good things. Because others are different from us, we look down on them. As a Party cadre, how narrow-minded is this! The Party has trained and educated me in order for me to unite everyone to improve the production of the blast furnace. But I have shut out the technical personnel who want to make progress and are willing to improve production, and I don't unite them and help them do a good job.
 
	Slowly, I also realized that the idea that "roughnecks cannot do the work of technical personnel" is also unrealistic. From more than a year of work, I feel that the technical personnel do not want us to teach them culture and theory. They can read Marxist-Leninist theoretical books themselves, but they are not good at applying theory to practical work and life. They hope that we can often point out which of their work attitudes and ideological styles are right and which are wrong, and tell them what they should do. As long as we contact the masses more, and get more help from the Party committee, we can help them solve these problems. In the past, I felt that I didn't understand technology, so it was difficult to study problems with them. In fact, the main thing that we need to help the technical personnel solve is not technical problems, but how to treat work. It is difficult not to understand technology, but it does not mean that we cannot work. For example, if the blast furnace is suspended, I cannot find the technical reasons myself, but I can find active and ideologically advanced technical personnel to help me analyze, and I can consult with skilled workers, and then carry out the work.
 
	However, this does not mean that studying theory and technical knowledge is not necessary for our Party and trade union cadres. On the contrary, at present, I feel that it is precisely because my theoretical level is low and my technical knowledge is lacking that my work cannot go further in depth. Some technical personnel have said that our work can no longer meet their needs. Sometimes, when I encounter ideological problems related to technology, I cannot analyze them clearly. Although I can rely on the help of others, I am always subject to some restrictions. Our shift leader once said to me very sincerely: "Lao Ma, you have to learn technology too!" My theoretical level is too low, and when I talk to technical personnel, I can only talk about specific things, and I cannot raise the specific problems to the level of policies and theories for analysis and criticism. In this way, my help to them is not great enough. I am determined to work hard to overcome these shortcomings and further improve the political and ideological work of the technical personnel.

### 我怎样学习在技术人员中进行政治思想工作

    我怎样学习在技术人员中进行政治思想工作
    中共鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂甲班支部书记　马兴旺
    我原来是一个高炉工人。一九五二年八月开始担任车间的支部委员和工会主席，以后又担任支部书记。
      在我开始做党和工会工作时，我根本不对技术人员进行政治思想工作。那时候，我对技术人员有着很多错误的看法。上级党委告诉我们技术人员是工人阶级的一部分，应该团结他们搞好生产。我想，怎么能说他们是工人阶级呢，这些人多半是地主、资产阶级家里出来的，说的干的，那一点和工人也不一样。我还特别看不惯他们那么爱干净，吃馒头剥皮，下了班不洗手、不洗脸就不吃东西。我当工人的时候，有一次喝水剩了半碗，有个技术员要喝水，拿起来把水倒了还不算，还要把碗再洗洗，好像我们工人喝口水把碗都会弄脏了似的。再说，我这么一个大老粗，怎么能对人家大学生进行政治思想工作呢。人家看上一天书，知道的东西就比咱们一个月学的还多。我和人家讲话，要是一句说不对，叫人钻空子给问住了，多不好看。
    但是，炼铁厂党委对于技术人员工作抓得很紧。我当工会主席不久，党就要我们把技术人员发动起来参加竞赛。这可把我难住了。每天上了班把话都想好，打算去找技术人员谈谈，可是一走上高炉台，见了技术员们，就把想好的话都忘了。工作做不了，自然要挨批评，弄得我愁眉苦脸没有办法。
    有一天值班长曾新荣和我谈起这个问题。曾新荣是一个很进步的技术人员，过去我当工人时他当技术员。那时他耐心地教我技术，和我关系很好。这时我就把我的苦闷统统告诉了他。他立即指出我的不对，说我把技术人员估计得太低了，他告诉我技术人员虽有缺点，但很多人是要求进步，愿意得到党的帮助的。他还表示愿意帮助我做好这件工作。
    不久，一号高炉因为操作有毛病，连着出了几炉号外铁（就是不合国家规定标准的铁）。这个高炉的技术员却爱面子，不肯向大家承认错误。工人很不满意他。双方的关系越来越不好，技术员闹情绪准备不干了。曾新荣帮助我解决了这个问题。他先帮助我分析了出号外铁的技术操作上的原因。我心里有了底，就去找这个技术员谈话。先是，他不肯承认错误。但是，当我耐心地指出了出号外铁的原因并和他讲了应该怎样对待错误以后，他的态度就转变了。以后支部书记和曾新荣又分别找他谈话。几天以后，一高炉又出了号外铁，没等我们提出，他就主动地向工人做了检讨，工人很满意。这时候，我才觉得技术人员真是要求进步的，因而也就不那么怕和他们谈话了。
    党委对于我们基层干部给了很多帮助和支持。党委经常分析批判我们对技术人员的错误认识和不敢对技术人员进行政治思想工作的顾虑，并且具体教给我们办法。当时，有些技术人员还瞧不起我们基层干部，有问题，他们总是直接找党委而不找我们。为了锻炼基层干部并提高基层干部的威信，党委一般都不直接解决他们的问题，总是让他们来找支部。我们搞不好，党委再来帮助我们。就这样我慢慢地敢于主动地去向技术人员进行政治思想工作，也初步摸着了一些办法。
    我觉得要做好对技术人员的政治思想工作，必须依靠技术人员中的积极分子。一个党的干部，做任何工作都不能光靠自己。但开始时我并没有懂得这一点，因为我觉得技术人员都是落后的。一高炉技术员的转变，曾新荣起了很大作用。以后，我就逐渐地注意了这一点。现在我们这个班里已经有好几个技术人员积极分子了。在了解技术人员的思想情况，特别是遇到一些技术问题时，我们都找技术人员中的积极分子商量，分配给他们任务。召开扩大支委会，讨论国家计划也吸收技术人员中的积极分子列席。他们对于党分配的工作都能认真完成，及时向党汇报，分配给他们工作时，他们都很高兴，觉得这是党相信他们，是他们的光荣。这些积极分子对党的工作很起作用。有些事情，他们去向别的技术人员讲，就比我们党和工会的干部去讲还容易生效。因为技术人员比较相信技术人员的话；同时，他们了解的技术人员的思想情况常常比我们深入具体。我们党和工会的干部技术水平低，很需要他们帮助。要是曾新荣不告诉我一高炉出号外铁的技术操作上的原因，很可能技术员不承认错误，我的工作就很难进行。对于技术人员中的积极分子，不能只是使用，而同时还要不断地帮助他们、提高他们。这样，才能满足他们进步的要求，才能更好地发挥他们的作用。
    我们还注意了从各方面了解技术人员的思想和工作情况，比如，要研究一个值班技术员的思想和工作问题，我们就要找值班长、瓦斯工人、炉前工人中的党员积极分子等上下左右和他有工作关系的人去征求意见。问题摸清楚了就好办了。去年冬天贯彻一长负责制时，我们就这样帮助值班长树立了威信。值班长要向大家做检查领导工作的报告，支部就先召开了工人积极分子会、行政组长会，让他们对值班长提意见，还分别征求一部分积极的技术员对值班长的意见和要求。支部把这些意见分析研究，整理好交给值班长。结果，值班长检查得很好，群众很满意。他的威信比过去提高了。值班长很高兴地向我讲：“咱们支部的办法真好，是不是也可以在其他支部推广推广。”其实，我们几个班的支部都是这样做的。
    要经常给技术人员帮助，特别是当他们遇到困难，生产上出了毛病时，要帮他们找出解决问题的办法。有一次，八高炉连续出事故，工人不满意技术员，技术员又挨了厂长的批评。支部决定帮助技术员想出解决问题的办法。我去宿舍找技术员谈话时，技术员还没有弄清楚出事故和工人不满意的原因。因为事先支部已经连开了两次小型的党员积极分子会议，掌握了情况，我就耐心地帮助他进行了深入的分析，使他认识到不倾听群众意见和对群众要求过高、态度急躁等错误。我们的谈话很融洽很亲切。技术员也要求进步，一找到自己的毛病，马上就想出了克服的办法。他向群众作了很深刻的检讨。以后和工人的关系搞得很好，生产也好转了。这样的工作，我们经常在做。
    在生活上要多和技术人员接近。我们常上宿舍找他们，有时谈问题，有时闲扯。前不久，因为生产不好，我们班有两个技术员在党委召开的技术人员座谈会上受了批评，我就赶快到宿舍去看他们，问问他们有没有意见，工作中有没有困难，看看他们的情绪有没有波动。大家经常接近了，隔阂就慢慢消除了。当他们觉得我们不再把他们当“外人”看了，就能很自然地向我们讲讲心里话。有的技术员曾经告诉我，他过去肯谈自己的问题，可不愿涉及别人，怕别人知道了要讲闲话；有的技术员向我提出，要我们对他们不要老是像哄小孩子似的，有不对，就严格批评。了解了他们的思想和要求，工作就好做了。
    从这一年多的工作中，我深深地感觉到，要做好对技术人员的政治思想工作，首先得纠正我们对技术人员的一些错误看法。当我慢慢地认识到我过去的错误时，我就觉得过去我没有把工作做好的根源就在这里。党规定了政策，要我们认真地团结改造技术人员，而我却没有好好学习党的政策，没有按照党的政策办事。我仍然用旧社会的眼光来看技术人员，没有分别清楚现在他们已经不是在为资本家服务，而是为搞好我们的社会主义企业工作。我甚至把旧社会里工人因为资本家残酷剥削而养成的不讲卫生的习惯也当成很好的东西。因为人家和我们不一样，就看不起人家。作为一个党的干部，这眼光是多么狭小啊！党培养教育了我，为的是要我团结大家把高炉的生产搞好。我却把要求进步愿意搞好生产的技术人员关在门外，不去团结他们，不去帮助他们搞好工作。
    慢慢地我也认识到“大老粗不能做技术人员工作”的想法也是不切实际的。从这一年多的工作中，我感到技术人员并不是要我们给他们教文化、讲理论。他们自己会读马克思列宁主义理论书籍，但是不善于把理论用到实际的工作和生活中。他们就希望我们能经常指出他们工作态度思想作风中那些是对的，那些是错的，告诉他们应该怎么办。这些问题，只要我们多和群众联系，多取得党委的帮助，是可以帮他们解决的。过去我觉得自己不懂技术，不好和他们研究问题。事实上，需要我们帮技术人员解决的主要的不是技术问题，而是怎样对待工作的问题。不懂技术是有困难，但并不是就不能工作。比如，高炉悬料了，我自己不能找出技术上的原因，但是，我可以找积极的、思想先进的技术人员帮助我分析，可以找熟练工人商量，然后再去进行工作。
    但是，这决不是说，学习理论和技术知识对于我们党和工会的干部是不需要的。恰恰相反，目前，我觉得正是因为自己的理论水平低和技术知识缺乏，我的工作不能进一步深入下去。有些技术人员表示我们的工作已不能满足他们的要求。有时，遇到和技术有关的思想问题，我就不能分析清楚，虽然可以依靠别人的帮助，但总要受到一些限制。我们的值班长就曾经很诚恳地对我说：“老马，你们也得学技术啊！”我的理论水平太低，和技术人员谈话时，就只能讲讲具体的事情，而不能把具体问题提高到政策、理论上来分析批判。这样，对他们的帮助就不够大。我决心努力来克服这些缺点，进一步做好对技术人员的政治思想工作。
