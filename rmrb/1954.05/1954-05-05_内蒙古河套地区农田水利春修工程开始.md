The spring repair project for farmland water conservancy in the Hetao Administrative Region of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has commenced around April 20th. To ensure timely irrigation and prevent floods, irrigation projects will be completed before May 15th, and flood prevention projects will be completed by the end of June.

This spring's total projects number as many as 117, involving the excavation of 1,449,000 cubic meters of earth, requiring more than 387,000 workdays, and a capital investment of over 2.3 billion yuan. Among them, the water diversion and bank protection of the Jiefang Sluice Gate, the water diversion and silt flushing of the Changta Canal, the water diversion and channel straightening of the Yihe Canal, and the water diversion stone gate of the Yuanzi Canal are all relatively large projects.

The planning of this year's spring repair project is based on the principle of preventing drought and combating drought. Special emphasis has been placed on studying the water diversion issues of the major main canals to ensure timely irrigation even under low water levels in the Yellow River.
