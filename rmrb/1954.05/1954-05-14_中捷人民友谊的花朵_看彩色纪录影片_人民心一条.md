    Jointly produced by the Film Studio of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing Film Studio, and the Czechoslovak Army Film Studio
    The color documentary "Hearts as One" stirs the audience's hearts with its great and sincere friendship.
    The theme of this film, just like its name, is so clear and enthusiastically praises the profound friendship between the Chinese and Czech people. Its profound ideological content is not expressed with lifeless, rigid pictures and empty, poor words; it is the result of careful research by Chinese and Czech film artists, who creatively and truthfully filmed the activities of the Czechoslovak Vit Nejedlý Army Art Troupe (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Army Art Troupe) visiting our country in the autumn of 1952. It uses vivid images to show rich and profound ideological content.
    From the beginning of the film, depicting the Czech Army Art Troupe's arrival in our capital, Beijing, to the final farewell performance, the mood is always full. The entire film is filled with beautiful emotions and meaningful scenes. People can see that the authors of the film are by no means recording all the scenes they see with a careless and indifferent attitude, or in a "purely objective" way; every shot and every scene in the film has been carefully selected by the authors and is permeated with their love for the Chinese and Czech people and their profound feelings. They keenly captured many wonderful scenes. This is not easy to do without clear insight and skillful artistic techniques.
    The opening shot of the film is the rotating Earth. Although our country and Czechoslovakia are more than 10,000 kilometers apart, the great Soviet Union connects the peace-loving people of the East and the West. The members of the Czech Army Art Troupe, carrying the enthusiasm and respect of the Czechoslovak people, set foot on our land, and our people greeted their brothers from afar with the same enthusiasm and respect. The film's camera, following the footsteps of the Czech soldiers, records the meetings and gatherings of the two peoples. At Beijing Airport, there were cheers from the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Young Pioneers; on the shore of Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing, the grand gathering turned Xuanwu Lake into an ocean of joyful songs and dances; on the vast sea of the East China Sea, the sea breeze blew on the smiling faces of the Chinese and Czech soldiers; in front of the Liberation Monument in Chongqing, the welcoming crowd, as the narration describes, was "an ocean of people and an ocean of flowers." The scene at the end of the farewell performance was even more moving, with flowers being thrown up and down the stage. This is the flower of great brotherly friendship.
    In the film, we also saw scenes where Czech soldiers visited the germ bomb casings, germ-carrying flies, frogs, and spiders dropped by American imperialists in Korea and Northeast China. The camera showed their angry faces as they wrote words protesting this inhuman crime. At a land reform exhibition, Czech soldiers cast hateful glances at the landlords' gorgeous clothes and furniture; with infinite sympathy, they watched the farmers' dilapidated huts and broken utensils.
    We also saw the moving scene of Czech soldiers meeting Chen Yongkang, a model rice grower in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province. Chen Yongkang, representing the farmers in his village, gave a bundle of ripening rice as a gift to the distinguished guests from afar. The guests raised Chen Yongkang high to show their respect and gratitude to the Chinese farmers. They celebrated like their own harvest, and together with our farmers, they beat gongs and drums and marched joyfully on the small roads of the rice fields.
    In the textile factory in Shanghai and on the grounds of the Fushun coal mine in Northeast China, we saw the meetings between Czech soldiers and Chinese workers. They listened quietly to the workers talking about their production achievements and carefully recorded them in their notebooks; they warmly shook hands with the coal miners and were happy for the great achievements of our workers in production.
    In these descriptions of the fraternal relationship between the Czechoslovak and Chinese people, we can see that the two peoples are so harmonious and close! We are linked together by the common ideal and belief of building a socialist society. We share common joys, and we unanimously express our infinite anger at the enemies of peace.
    The film intimately and movingly depicts the relationship between the Czech soldiers and our new generation. The game of "Blind Man's Bluff" played by Czech soldiers and our Young Pioneers on the lawn of Beihai Park is a very interesting and wonderful scene. The posture of the famous Czech comedian Jedek, who was blindfolded and groping for another blind man in the circle of children, was so interesting and amusing. When he touched the children, he was afraid of hurting them and hurriedly dodged, but unexpectedly fell to the ground. We saw the scene of the Czech soldiers and children laughing.
    At the "August 1st" Elementary School, the children picked flowers and gave them to their dear Czechoslovak uncles and aunts, and performed their own programs for them. The Czech soldiers carried the children down the slide and helped them sit on the small airplanes. The children and soldiers spent a happy time together. The authors of the film selected these moving scenes for us, making us feel that the deep Sino-Czech friendship is manifested in all aspects.
    The film excellently introduces our magnificent mountains and rivers and brilliant cultural relics, and all the introductions are not separated from the theme of the film and introduced in isolation, but are closely combined with the travels of the Czech Army Art Troupe members, with the scenery appearing as part of the emotions of admiration and love of the distant guests. People are the masters of this film, and since their mood is so pleasant, the scenery is particularly beautiful and moving. Many lyrical shots are edited into the film: the visit to the Summer Palace and the singing of Chinese and Czech army art workers on the shore of Kunming Lake are so unique and interesting. The azure distant mountains, the white cottony clouds, and the clear lake water weave a beautiful curtain. The Moravian folk song "Dawn Dew" sung by the Czech Army Art Troupe and the "Song of the Tibetan People Praising the Liberation Army" sung by the Chinese People's Liberation Army art workers are so beautiful here. The Nine-Dragon Wall relief in Beihai and the exquisite architecture of the Temple of Heaven were admired by the guests. Even the white stone railings and steps of the Forbidden City, a corner of the palace, and a path in Beijing, are so rich in the characteristics of oriental architecture in the film's detailed depiction. The scenery of West Lake is even more charming, with small boats swaying on the still lake, carrying our guests and workers who are recuperating in West Lake, watching the blooming lotus flowers and the beautiful scenery of the sunset. When the ship passed through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, the film depicted the scenery of the Three Gorges that the guests saw sitting on the bow of the ship: the rushing river water, the mountains that pierced the clouds, and the villages in the valleys on both sides. These places that our ancient poets have repeatedly praised are once again read as poetry in the film's description. On the journey of the train carrying the guests to southern China, the guests sat in front of the train windows, quietly watching the southern villages, the green rice fields, and the lush banana gardens, large plots of pineapple fields, and the fruitful papaya trees.
    All of these scenery descriptions are so fascinating. These descriptions contain rich emotions. It makes us realize from the images that our motherland is so vast and so beautiful and lovely. Our guests' deep love for it is also well expressed here.
    This film vividly expresses the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Czech people and the idea of ​​struggling for common ideals through images, colors, and sounds. The film is full of deep internationalist and patriotic feelings from beginning to end. People did not hear empty discussions and didactic words, but everyone learned the most vivid lesson from here. This is a beautiful work that has achieved "visualized political commentary." The achievement of this film is the result of the close cooperation of Chinese and Czech filmmakers. It is a flower of friendship between the Chinese and Czech people.

    导演：瞿白音、董小吾、弗依达·亚西尼、查理·嘉西尼亚
    摄影：查理·嘉西尼亚、弗依达·亚西尼、曹进云、田力
    中国人民解放军电影制片厂、北京电影制片厂、捷克斯洛伐克陆军电影制片厂联合摄制
    彩色纪录片“人民心一条”以伟大真挚的友情激动着观众的心。
    这部影片的主题正如它的名字一样，如此鲜明，如此热情地歌颂了中捷人民间的深厚友谊。它的深刻的思想内容不是用那些缺乏生气的呆板画面和空洞贫乏的言词来表现的，它是经过中捷两国电影艺术家们的精心研究，创造性地把一九五二年秋天，访问我国的捷克斯洛伐克维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团（以下简称捷军文工团）的活动，真实地拍摄下来。它用生动的形象，显现出丰富而深刻的思想内容。
    影片从开始描写捷军文工团来我国的首都北京，到最后的告别演出情绪始终是饱满的。整部影片充满了有美好情感和意味深长的画面。人们可以看出：影片的作者们，决不是以漫不经心的冷淡态度，“纯客观”地纪录他们所看到的一切场景；影片的每一个镜头，每一个画面，都经过作者们的精心挑选，都浸透着他们对中捷两国人民的热爱和深刻的感受。他们敏锐地把许多十分美妙的情景摄入镜头。这没有明晰的洞察力和熟练的艺术技巧，是不容易做到的。
    影片开始出现的镜头是旋转的地球。虽然我们的国土和捷克斯洛伐克距离一万多公里之遥，但伟大的苏联，把东方和西方爱好和平的人民连接在一起。捷军文工团员们带着捷克斯洛伐克人民的热情和敬意，踏上了我们的国土，我国人民以同样的热情和敬意迎接来自远方的兄弟。影片的镜头，随着捷军战士的足迹，纪录了两国人民的会见和联欢。在北京飞机场上，响着中国人民解放军战士和少年先锋队员们的欢呼声；在南京玄武湖畔，盛大的联欢使玄武湖变成了欢乐的歌舞海洋；在东海辽阔的海面上，海风吹拂着中捷两国战士们的笑脸；在重庆解放纪念碑前，欢迎的人群正像说明词所描写的是“人的海洋和花的海洋”。临别演出终场时的情景更是动人，台上台下的鲜花掷下来又掷上去，两国战士被高高抛起。这是兄弟般的伟大友谊的花朵。
    我们在影片里还看到这样的场面：捷军战士参观美帝国主义者在朝鲜和我国东北掷下的细菌弹壳、带菌的苍蝇、青蛙和蜘蛛时，镜头里出现了他们的愤怒脸色，他们写下了抗议这种绝灭人性的罪行的言词。在一个土地改革展览会上，捷军战士以憎恶的目光，投射在地主的华丽服装和家具上；以无限的同情，观看着农民居住的简陋不堪的茅屋和残破的食具。
    我们还看见了：捷军战士会见江苏省松江县水稻丰产模范陈永康的动人情景。陈永康，代表他村里的农民，把即将成熟的一束稻子作为礼物，送给远方来的贵客。客人们把陈永康高高抬起，表示他们对中国农民的敬意和感谢。他们像庆祝自己的丰收一样，和我国农民一同打着锣和腰鼓，欢腾地行进在稻田的小路上。
    在上海的纺织厂里，在东北抚顺煤矿的场地上，我们看见了捷军战士和中国工人的会见。他们静听着工人们讲述自己的生产成绩，细心地把它记录在本子上；他们热情地和煤矿工人握手致意，为我国工人在生产上的巨大成就而高兴。
    在这些描写捷克斯洛伐克人民和我国人民的兄弟关系中，我们可以看到，两国人民是如此融洽无间！我们为建设社会主义社会的共同理想和共同信念连结在一起，我们交流着共同的喜悦，我们一致表示对和平敌人的无限愤怒。
    影片亲切动人地描写了捷军战士和我国新生一代的关系。在北海公园的草地上，捷军战士和我国少年先锋队员玩的“摸老瞎”的游戏，是一个极有风趣的精采画面。那个捷克斯洛伐克的著名喜剧演员杰代克，在孩子们围坐的圆圈中，蒙上眼去摸另一个老瞎时的姿势是那么有趣和逗人笑，当他碰到了孩子们，又怕碰坏他们而急忙躲闪，不料却跌倒在地上时，我们看到了捷军战士们和孩子们欢笑的情景。
    在“八一”小学校里，孩子们采摘鲜花，送给他们亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克叔叔和阿姨们，为他们表演了自己的节目。捷军战士们抱着孩子们一道走滑梯，帮助孩子们坐小飞机。孩子们和战士们一起度过了一段快乐的时间。影片作者们，给我们挑选了这些动人的镜头，使我们感到中捷友谊的深厚，是表现在各个方面的。
    影片很出色地介绍了我国的壮丽山河和斑烂的文化古迹，而所有的介绍都不是脱离影片的主题，孤立地介绍的，而是紧紧结合着捷军文工团员的游踪，把景物依附在远客们对它的赞赏和爱恋的情感中出现的。人是这部影片的主人，人的心情是那么愉快，景色也就格外显得美丽动人了。许多抒情意味的镜头被编辑在影片里：颐和园的游览和昆明湖畔中捷军队文艺工作者的演唱，是那么别致有趣。蔚蓝色的远山，白绵绵的云朵，清澈的湖水织成了一张美丽的幕。捷军文工团演唱的摩拉维亚民歌“黎明的露”，中国人民解放军文艺工作者演唱的“藏胞歌唱解放军”，在这里是那么动听。北海的九龙壁浮雕和天坛的精美建筑，使客人们赞赏不已。即使是故宫的白色石栏和台阶，宫殿的一角，北京的一条甬道，在影片的细致描写中，都那么富有东方建筑的特色。西湖的风景更是迷人，静静的湖面上荡漾着小船，载着我们的客人和正在西湖休养的工人，观赏盛开的荷花和落日的美景。轮船经过长江三峡时，影片给我们描绘了客人们坐在船头观赏到的三峡景色：那湍急的江水，插入云霄的山峰，两岸的山谷村庄。这些我们古代的诗人曾再三歌咏的地方，影片的描写，又让我们在这里读到了诗。载着客人们的列车向我国南方飞驰的旅途中，客人们坐在车窗前，静静地观赏着南方的村庄、绿色的稻田和那茂密的香蕉园、大块的菠萝田和结实累累的木瓜树。
    这一切的景物描写，是那么引人入胜。这些描写是包含着丰富的感情的。它使我们从形象里认识到：我们的祖国是这么辽阔广大，这么美丽可爱。我们的客人们对它的深刻的爱，也在这里很好地抒发出来了。
    这部影片通过形象、色彩和声音，把中捷两国人民的友好团结，为共同理想而斗争的思想，很动人地表现了出来。影片从头到尾洋溢着国际主义和爱国主义的深湛情感。人们没有听到空泛的议论和教训口吻的言词，然而人人都从这里上了最生动的一课。这是一部做到了“形象化的政论”的优美作品。这部影片的成就，是中捷电影工作者亲密合作的结果。它是中捷两国人民的友谊之花。
