Huangshi City Party Member Cadres
Study the Fourth Plenary Session Resolution and Inspect Work

    Party member cadres in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, are enthusiastically studying the Fourth Plenary Session Resolution. The Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a twelve-day plenary session from late March to mid-April to examine the work and unity of the Municipal Committee. The Party committees of seven major factories, mines, and engineering units, including the Central China Iron and Steel Company, have also begun or are about to begin inspecting their work. Thousands of cadres throughout the city have listened to one or two transmissions of the documents, studied them diligently, and engaged in discussions in light of their own thinking.

    During this study, the Municipal Committee and factory and mine party member cadres, based on the Fourth Plenary Session Resolution, corrected the liberalism of not speaking out in person about opinions in the past, earnestly unfolded criticism and self-criticism, and focused on examining the work and unity problems of the Municipal Committee. At the plenary session of the Municipal Committee, everyone agreed that the Municipal Committee was basically united, but there were still serious unhealthy phenomena in the unity issue. This was mainly manifested in: the Municipal Committee emphasizing the special circumstances of Huangshi City, disregarding the overall situation, and harboring resentment towards the higher-level Party committee, thus exhibiting phenomena of lack of organization and discipline in the execution of the higher-level Party committee's instructions; there were also mutual complaints among the members of the Municipal Committee. The reasons for these phenomena were, first, the failure to strictly abide by the principles of collective leadership and democratic centralism. The plenary session of the Municipal Committee had only been held once in the past nine months, which damaged the principle of the Party's collective leadership. Second, the Party's organizational life was extremely unsound, and it was impossible to seriously and earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism. Comrades lost mutual assistance and supervision, and some comrades therefore fostered individualism and complacency, comparing themselves with others, calculating fame and status, emphasizing individual roles, and so on.

    Based on the above situation, the plenary session of the Municipal Committee re-clarified the tasks of the Municipal Committee, especially the guarantees and supervision of factories and mines, as well as working methods and several systems. It requires all members of the Municipal Committee to be included in the branches of their respective units to participate in organizational life, accept the supervision of Party members and the masses, and modelly abide by the resolutions of the branches; the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee, and various party committees and party organizations should conduct ideological self-examination every two months, conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, and lead the city's workers and people to strive to realize the general task of the country's transition period.

    黄石市党员干部
    学习四中全会决议并检查工作
    湖北省黄石市的党员干部热烈学习四中全会决议。中共黄石市委会于三月下旬至四月中旬专门举行了十二天的全体会议，检查了市委的工作和团结问题。华中钢铁公司等七个主要厂矿和工程单位的党委也开始或即将开始检查工作。全市数千名干部都听了一次至两次传达，并钻研文件，联系自己的思想，进行了讨论。
    在这次学习中，市委和厂矿的党员干部，都根据四中全会的决议，纠正了过去有意见当面不讲的自由主义，认真展开批评与自我批评，着重检查了市委工作和团结问题。在市委全体会议上，大家一致认为市委基本上是团结的，但团结问题上还存在着严重的不健康现象。这主要表现在：市委有强调黄石市情况特殊，不顾整体，对上级党委有埋怨情绪，因而在执行上级党委指示时有无组织无纪律现象；市委委员之间也有互相埋怨现象，产生这些现象的原因，首先是未严格遵守集体领导与民主集中制的原则。市委全体会议九个月来只开过一次，使党的集体领导的原则受到损害。其次是党的组织生活极不健全，不能严肃认真展开批评和自我批评，同志之间失掉互助和监督，部分同志也因此滋长了个人主义和骄傲自满情绪，与人比论长短，计较名誉地位，强调个人作用等等。
    根据以上的情况，市委全体会议对市委的工作任务，特别是对厂矿企业的保证与监督，以及工作方法与若干制度重新作了明确的规定。要求所有市委委员均应编入所在单位的支部过组织生活，接受党员群众的监督，并模范地遵守支部决议；市委常委、各党委、党组织应每两月进行一次思想检讨，认真开展批评与自我批评，加强团结，领导全市工人、全市人民，为实现国家过渡时期的总任务而奋斗。（曹葆铭）
