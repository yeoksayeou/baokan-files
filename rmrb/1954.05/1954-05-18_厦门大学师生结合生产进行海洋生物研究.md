Xiamen University Teachers and Students Combine with Production to Conduct Marine Biological Research

Teachers and students at Xiamen University are combining with production to conduct marine biological research. Recently, Professor Zheng Chong, director of the Marine Biology Research Office of Xiamen University, and three others classified and identified ten different types of Xiamen sharks, and completed analytical research on shark feed and shark liver oil. Sharks are an important fish product in the coastal areas of Fujian. The meat can be eaten, the skin can be made into leather, the liver oil can be used for medicinal purposes, shark fins are valuable food, and fish bones can be made into fish meal. The results of these studies are helpful for shark fishing operations and processing production.

In addition, the research office also conducted research on plankton, which can discover the migration patterns of fish schools and the patterns of ocean currents, and completed the classification and identification of Xiamen mysid shrimp, long-necked shrimp, and krill. They are now conducting research on shipworms. Shipworms, also known as wood-boring insects, can massively destroy the wood of ships and docks. Therefore, this research work is very relevant to transportation and national defense construction.

The teachers and students of Xiamen University who study marine biology often go to the ocean and fishing grounds and aquaculture farms for internships and collect specimens. In their work, they are all careful to learn from experienced old fishermen. After conducting a survey of fishermen, six students from the Biology Department, combined with their usual research experiments, wrote a graduation thesis entitled "Investigation of Oysters Near Xiamen," which is of great practical value for oyster farming.

    厦门大学师生结合生产进行海洋生物研究
    厦门大学师生结合生产进行海洋生物研究工作。最近，厦门大学海洋生物研究室主任郑重教授等四人分类和鉴定了十种不同的厦门鲨鱼，并完成了鲨鱼食料和鲨鱼肝油的分析研究工作。鲨鱼是福建沿海的重要鱼产，肉可供食用，皮可制革，肝油可供药用，鱼翅是珍贵的食品，鱼骨可制成鱼粉。这些研究的结果，对鲨鱼的捕捞作业和加工生产都有帮助。
    此外，研究室还进行了可以发现鱼群洄游规律和海洋水流规律的浮游生物研究，完成了厦门毛虾、长颈虾和磷虾的分类和鉴定工作，现在正进行对船蛆的研究。船蛆又名凿木虫，能够大量破坏船舶和码头的木料。因此，这一研究工作对交通运输和国防建设都很有关系。
    厦门大学研究海洋生物的师生们经常到海洋上和渔场、养殖场中去实习，并采集标本。他们在工作中都很注意虚心向有丰富生产经验的老渔民学习。生物系的六个学生向渔民进行调查后，结合平时的研究实验，写了一篇“厦门附近牡蛎的调查”的毕业论文，对养殖牡蛎很有实用价值。　　（新华社）
