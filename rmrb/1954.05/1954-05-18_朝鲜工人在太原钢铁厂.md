    Korean Workers in Taiyuan
    Iron and Steel Plant by Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    A group of steel smelting workers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, trained with the assistance of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, have completed their studies and returned home. Among the Korean workers who came to study were demobilized soldiers, farmers, and students. The original plan was to train the Korean workers to become fourth-grade technicians within one year, but over the past year, due to the Korean workers' diligent study and hard work, and the enthusiastic help of the Chinese workers, their learning achievements have been very good. The results of the tests showed that more than 80% exceeded the learning plan, and most Korean workers have been promoted to the fifth, sixth, or seventh-grade level. Two workers have even been promoted to the level of fifth-grade technicians.
    The employees of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant regarded it as a great honor to help Korean workers master technology and strengthen the forces of peaceful construction. When Jiao Xiaolai, a technician from the coking department, was teaching the Korean worker Kim Bong-jong how to perform acetylene welding, because this was a complex operation that affected the quality of steel ingots, he was particularly meticulous and patient, and personally climbed into the steel bucket to demonstrate. He taught tirelessly for sixteen consecutive times until the Korean worker learned it. When Zhang Yusen, an old worker from the gas section, was teaching the Korean worker Kim Ik-gyun how to operate the gas suction machine, in order to help the Korean worker learn faster, he held his hand and explained while demonstrating. With such enthusiastic help, Kim Ik-gyun improved to the technical level of a seventh-grade worker in a very short time. Many workers also went to their dormitories during breaks to explain technical theories and operational methods.
    The Korean workers' spirit of diligently studying technology greatly moved the Chinese workers. Many Korean workers operated in front of the furnace at high temperatures all day long in the hot summer, with sweat pouring down. Chinese workers advised them to rest, but they said, "We can learn more technology if we sweat more." Some workers worked hard all day, reading books late into the night, and even did not rest on Sundays. Comrade Chi Sang-pil also put forward twelve suggestions on the production and equipment of the coking department; Che Ri-hong and others began to independently undertake the kiln firing task of the refractory materials department last year, which greatly helped the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant complete its production tasks.
    Before the departure, the Korean and Chinese workers were reluctant to part, and some were moved to tears. Korean worker Chi Sang-pil said: "It is like being at our own home here, but in order to build our country, we have to leave. Now we have not only learned technology, but also learned the Chinese working class's spirit of selflessly building the country. After returning home, we must use better actions to build the country to thank you."

    朝鲜工人在太原
    钢铁厂本报记者　金雨困
    太原钢铁厂帮助朝鲜民主主义人民共和国培养的一批钢铁冶炼工人，已经学成归国。这次来学习的朝鲜工人中有转业军人、农民和学生。原来的计划是要在一年内把朝鲜工人培养成为四级技工，但一年来，由于朝鲜工人苦学苦练和中国工人热情的帮助，他们学习的成绩很好，测验的结果百分之八十以上都超额完成了学习计划，大部朝鲜工人都提高到了五级、六级或七级的水平，还有两名工人已提高到了五级技术员的水平。
    太原钢铁厂的职工把帮助朝鲜工人掌握技术，增强和平建设力量引为莫大光荣。炼焦部技师焦孝来在教朝鲜工人金凤钟安塞焊时，因为这是一项影响到钢锭质量的复杂操作，他特别细致耐心并亲自爬到钢桶中去做，他这样不厌其烦地连续教了十六次，直到朝鲜工人学会为止。煤气工段老工人张裕森教朝鲜工人金益钧开动煤气吸气机时，为了使朝鲜工人更快学好，他手把着手一边讲一边做，在这样热情帮助下，金益钧在很短时间内提高到了七级工的技术水平。许多工人在休息的时候还到他们宿舍去讲解技术理论和操作方法。
    朝鲜工人坚苦钻研技术的精神使中国工人大为感动。许多朝鲜工人在酷热的夏天整日在炉前高温下操作，汗如水流，中国工人劝他们休息，他们说：“我们多流点汗才能学到更多技术。”有的工人辛勤劳动了一天，晚上看书看到深夜，甚至星期天也不休息。池相弼同志对炼焦部生产和设备还提出了十二条建议；车日弘等去年就开始单独担负了耐火器材部的烧窑任务，对太原钢铁厂完成生产任务有了很多帮助。
    离别前朝鲜工人和中国工人都留恋不舍，有的感动得流泪，朝鲜工人池相弼说：“在这里像在我们自己的家一样，但为了建设祖国，我们不得不离去，现在我们不仅学到了技术，而且也学到了中国工人阶级忘我地建设祖国精神，回国后我们一定要以更好建设祖国的行动，来感谢你们。”
