The New Face of Yan'an, a Revolutionary Holy Site

Since 1936, Yan'an, our country's revolutionary holy site, became the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the center of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement, and a famous democratic holy site at home and abroad. In 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries invaded and occupied Yan'an, causing serious damage to Yan'an. In 1948, the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated the city, allowing the people to rebuild their homes on the ruins. Since 1951, the local people's government has systematically carried out the restoration work of Yan'an. After several years of hard work, Yan'an's economic and cultural undertakings have greatly developed. The Zaoyuan, Yangjialing, and Wangjiaping areas where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao once lived have also been renovated.

These are two stone cave dwellings north of the Taoyuan in Wangjiaping, where Chairman Mao once lived.

This is the Central Auditorium in Yangjialing, Yan'an, which is being rebuilt. The Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held here in April 1945. The Kuomintang reactionaries severely damaged it when they occupied Yan'an. The people's government started the reconstruction project of this building in 1953, and it has now been completed.

Panlong Town in Yan'an experienced fierce battles during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and the streets and houses were destroyed. After several years of construction, it has been restored to a prosperous appearance. This is the lively scene of the market day on Panlong Town Street.

Yan'an's Zaoyuan was originally the location of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Young students sing praises of the great leader Chairman Mao in the fragrant Zaoyuan garden filled with peach and plum blossoms.

    革命圣地——延安的新面貌
    我国革命圣地——延安，自一九三六年起即成为中国共产党中央的所在地，是中国人民革命运动的中心和名闻中外的民主圣地。一九四七年国民党反动派侵占延安，使延安遭受到严重的破坏，一九四八年中国人民解放军光复了这个城市，人民得以在废墟上重建家园。自一九五一年起，当地人民政府有计划地进行了延安的恢复工作，经过几年的努力建设，延安的经济和文化事业都大有发展，党中央和毛主席曾经居住过的枣园、杨家岭和王家坪等地也都整修得焕然一新。

    这是王家坪的桃园北边的两孔石窑，毛主席曾在这里住过。
    这是正在重修中的延安杨家岭中央大礼堂。一九四五年四月中国共产党第七次全国代表大会即在此召开，国民党反动派占领延安时曾对它加以严重的破坏。一九五三年起人民政府开始了这座建筑的重修工程，现已全部完工。
    延安的蟠龙镇在第三次国内革命战争时期曾有过激烈的战斗，街道房屋都遭受到破坏，经过几年的修建，又恢复了繁荣的面貌，这是蟠龙镇大街上赶集时的热闹情形。
    延安枣园原来是中国共产党中央书记处的所在地，青年学生在枣园桃李芬芳的花园里歌颂着伟大的领袖毛主席。
