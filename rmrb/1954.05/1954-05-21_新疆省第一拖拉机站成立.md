      The first tractor station in Xinjiang Province was established on May 16th. This station is built near the Huoxing Collective Farm in the Second District of Urumqi County. It is now cultivating land for the Huoxing Collective Farm and nearby agricultural producers' cooperatives. Many surrounding farmers have come to visit.
      The first tractor station in Xinjiang Province began preparations for establishment in March of this year. The station already has two Soviet DET-54 tractors, one Kote-35 small tractor, and other farm implements. Combine harvesters, threshers, and seventy self-propelled wheat reapers will soon be added. The tractor station currently has eleven male and female tractor drivers from four ethnic groups: Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han. This year, ten young male and female members of the Huoxing Collective Farm will also be trained to become tractor drivers.

    新疆省第一拖拉机站已在五月十六日成立。这个站建立在乌鲁木齐县第二区火星集体农庄的附近，现在正为火星集体农庄和附近的农业生产合作社代耕土地，周围许多农民前来参观。
    新疆省第一拖拉机站是今年三月间开始筹备建立的。站内已有苏联德特五十四型拖拉机两架、可特三十五小型拖拉机一架和其他农具等，不久还将添置联合收割机、脱粒机和七十架自拨割麦机。拖拉机站现有维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉四个民族的男女拖拉机手十一名，今年还要训练火星集体农庄十名男女青年庄员成为拖拉机手。　（新华社）
