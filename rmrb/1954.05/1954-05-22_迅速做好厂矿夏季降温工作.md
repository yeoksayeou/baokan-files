    Quickly Do a Good Job in Summer Cooling Work in Factories and Mines
    Summer has arrived. The period ahead will be the busiest and most intense time of the year for industrial production and capital construction tasks, and a period that is decisive for the completion of the annual tasks. However, changes in climatic conditions also bring many difficulties to production. For example, in textile factories, if the workshop temperature is too high, the moisture content of the yarn and cloth will not be easy to maintain normally, and the yarn breakage rate will easily increase; due to dry air and flying dust, not only will workers' health be affected, but also productivity will be reduced. Furthermore, in high-temperature workshops of smelting plants, if summer cooling work is not done well, workers are prone to various heat radiation sicknesses. To ensure the normal progress of capital construction and production tasks during the summer and autumn, vigorously improving working conditions, especially reducing the temperature of workshops, becomes very necessary.
    This year, many factories and mines have attached great importance to summer cooling work, and preparations have been made relatively early. Some factories and mines have already implemented or are implementing specific cooling measures. However, some enterprises still do not pay enough attention to this work. Also, some cadres in charge of technical safety work rely solely on spending a lot of money to purchase cooling equipment from outside when carrying out this work, without immediately taking action to improve existing ventilation equipment and engaging in other measures that can be taken at present. These ideas and practices are incorrect.
    To improve high-temperature operating environments, further protect workers' safety and health, and improve product output and quality, based on past experience, enterprise leaders should actively guide employees to closely integrate the technical innovation movement within the enterprise with cooling work. Depending on the specific circumstances, adopting methods such as removing heat sources, using water curtains, water tanks, asbestos baffles and other heat barriers, insulation, strengthening natural ventilation and local mechanical ventilation in high-temperature factory buildings, providing high-temperature operating workers with salt drinks, and distributing heat-resistant protective gear, setting up sunshades, etc., are all very good cooling methods. With good cooling equipment, it is also necessary to do a good job in management and organization, and carry out publicity and education work on cooling. In the past, some cooling measures often failed to be consciously implemented by employees and failed to play a cooling role due to insufficient publicity and education work. For example, many workers in enterprises are unwilling to drink salt drinks or use heat-resistant copper wire masks. It is necessary to strengthen publicity and education regarding these.
    Now time is very tight. Enterprises that have not yet started cooling work should start immediately; enterprises that have already started cooling work should also conduct a thorough inspection and quickly do a good job in summer cooling work.

### 迅速做好厂矿夏季降温工作

    迅速做好厂矿夏季降温工作
    夏季已经到了。今后将是全年工业生产和基本建设任务最为繁重最为紧张的时期，也是对全年任务的完成具有决定意义的时期。但是气候条件的变化，也给生产带来了许多困难。比如在纺织厂，如果车间温度太高，纱布的含水率就不易正常，纱的断头率极易增加；由于空气干燥，花尘飞扬，不但影响工人健康，也会使生产率降低。再如在冶炼厂的高温车间里，如果夏季降温工作作得不好，就往往会使工人们发生各种热辐射病。要保证夏秋期间基本建设和生产任务的正常进行，大力改善作业条件，特别是降低车间的温度就成为十分必要了。
    今年许多厂矿对夏季降温工作很重视，准备工作作得比较早，有些厂矿已经进行了或正在进行降温的具体措施。但也有些企业对这件工作还不够重视。也有些负责技术安全工作的干部，他们在进行这一工作时，只是依赖于花许多钱向外添购降温设备，而不立即动手来改善已有的通风设备，和从事目前可以进行的其他措施。这些想法和做法都是不对的。
    要改善高温操作环境，进一步保障工人的安全和健康，提高产品的产量和质量，根据以往经验，企业的领导上应该积极引导职工将企业内开展的技术革新运动与降温工作密切结合起来。根据具体情况，采取移去热源，采用水幕、水箱、石棉挡板等挡热，隔热，加强高温厂房的自然通风及局部机械通风，供给高温操作工人食盐饮料，发放防热护具，设凉棚等等，都是很好的降温办法。有了良好的降温设备，还必须做好管理组织工作，开展对于降温的宣传教育工作。过去有些降温措施由于宣传教育工作不够，常常不能为职工自觉执行，不能发挥降温的作用。如不少企业内工人不愿饮用食盐饮料，不肯使用防热的铜丝面罩等。这些都有必要加强宣传教育。
    现在时间已很紧迫，没有动手做降温工作的企业应立即动手；已着手进行降温工作的企业也应进行一次深入的检查，把夏季降温工作迅速作好。
