    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, May 13th: The Yongding River Guanting Reservoir, the first giant valley reservoir built in China's water conservancy construction, has completed all its projects after the completion of its final project, the intake tower, in early May. From now on, the 47,000 square kilometer basin of the Yongding River will be controlled by the reservoir, permanently eliminating the threat of Yongding River floods to the capital and Tianjin, and reducing disasters for millions of people downstream. According to preliminary estimates, by just preventing floods and thus averting land submersion, increasing agricultural production, and reducing annual maintenance expenses for downstream river embankments, the country can increase its income by at least 100 million catties of millet each year.
    The Guanting Reservoir project started in October 1951, with more than 40,000 workers and farmers participating in this great construction project. Thanks to their joint efforts, coupled with the support of the people of the whole country and the help of Soviet water conservancy experts, the project progressed rapidly. In November 1952 and June 1953, the water diversion tunnel and stilling basin projects were completed respectively. Before National Day in 1953, the two major projects, the dam and the spillway, were completed five or six days ahead of schedule. During the winter construction of the final intake tower project, the people building the reservoir created steam sandblasting and promoted the advanced experience of Soviet winter construction, thus overcoming the severe cold of the northern frontier and ensuring that the project was completed on schedule according to the design standards before the spring flood season. Radically curing the Yongding River's water患 (disaster), something that no ruler managed to accomplish during the six hundred and thirty years from the Yanyou period of the Yuan Dynasty until the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the people have now achieved their first victory in just two and a half years. Now, a 45-meter high and 290-meter long dam stands majestically at the entrance of the Guanting Gorge on the Guanting Reservoir construction site, cutting off the path of the Yongding River's floodwaters. To the west of the dam, a 44-meter high giant intake tower rises. It is connected to a water diversion tunnel with a diameter of eight meters and a length of one *li*, becoming the central hub for controlling the reservoir's planned water storage and diversion. To the east of the dam lies a 431-meter long and 20-meter wide spillway. When the flood threatens the dam or the intake tower's gates malfunction, the flood can be discharged from here. This reservoir can control the once-in-a-thousand-year floods of the Yongding River. The highest flood peak of 8,600 cubic meters per second in the upper reaches of the Yongding River will also be tamed here. When the Guanting Reservoir began to block floods in late August 1953, it stopped the second largest flood in the Yongding River's hydrological record. The losses avoided by preventing this flood alone have already exceeded the cost of the reservoir itself.
    The Guanting Reservoir is a giant valley reservoir with a flood storage capacity of 2.27 billion cubic meters, a man-made lake of 230 square kilometers in the Huailai Basin. In the future, after the reservoir is full of water, it can appropriately regulate the dry and windy continental climate of the northern frontier. The water from the reservoir can also be used for future Beijing-Tianjin navigation, as well as for industrial and domestic water use in the capital. At present, a hydroelectric power station powered by the water storage of the Guanting Reservoir is actively preparing for construction. The Fengsha Railway project, newly built along the west bank of the reservoir, is underway intensely. Soon, passengers on the Beijing-Baotou Railway will be able to take trains along the lake.

### 官厅水库工程全部胜利竣工  从此减免永定河洪水对下游人民的灾害

    官厅水库工程全部胜利竣工
    从此减免永定河洪水对下游人民的灾害
    【新华社保定十三日电】我国水利建设中兴建的第一座巨型山谷水库——永定河官厅水库，五月上旬完成了它的最后一项工程进水塔工程后，全部工程完工了。从此，永定河的四万七千平方公里的流域范围，将受到水库的控制，永远免除永定河洪水对首都和天津一带的威胁，减免下游千百万人民的灾害。据初步估计，只因拦住洪水而免除土地淹没、增加农产和减少下游河堤的岁修开支，每年至少可为国家增加一万万斤小米的收入。
    官厅水库工程是一九五一年十月间开工的，参加这一伟大建设工程的有四万多个职工和农民。由于他们的共同努力，加以全国人民的支援和苏联水利专家的帮助，工程进展很快。一九五二年十一月和一九五三年六月，就分别完成输水隧洞和静水池工程。一九五三年国庆节前夕，拦河坝和溢洪道两大工程都比原计划提前五六天完成。建设水库的人们在最后一项进水塔工程冬季施工中，又创造蒸汽喷沙和推广苏联冬季施工的先进经验，因而战胜了塞外严寒，使工程顺利地在春汛前按照设计标准如期完成。根治永定河水患，从元朝延祐年间起直到国民党反动政府崩溃的六百三十多年中，历代统治者没有办成的事，如今只两年半的时间，人民便取得了第一个胜利。现在官厅水库的工地上一座四十五公尺高、二百九十公尺长的拦河坝，巍然屹立在官厅山峡进口，切断了永定河洪水的去路。大坝的西侧，耸立起一座四十四公尺高的巨型进水塔。它和一条直径八公尺、长一华里的输水隧道相接，成为控制水库有计划蓄水和输水的总枢纽。大坝东边，躺着一条长四百三十一公尺、宽二十公尺的溢洪道，当洪水危及大坝或因进水塔闸门发生故障时，洪水就可从这里排出。这个水库可以控制永定河千年一遇的洪水，永定河上游每秒钟八千六百立方公尺的最高洪水峰，到这里也将被治服。一九五三年八月下旬，官厅水库开始拦洪时，便挡住了永定河有水文记载以来的第二次大水。单是防止这次水灾所避免的损失，就已超过了水库本身的造价。
    官厅水库是一座蓄洪量达二十二亿七千多万公方的巨型山谷水库，是怀来盆地上的一个二百三十平方公里的人造湖。将来水库蓄满水后，可使干燥多风的塞外大陆性气候得到适当的调剂。水库的水还可以供未来京津航运和首都工业用水及生活用水。目前，一座以官厅水库蓄水为动力的水电站正积极准备施工。沿水库西岸新建的丰沙铁路工程正在紧张进行。不久，京包铁路上的旅客就可乘火车沿湖而过。
