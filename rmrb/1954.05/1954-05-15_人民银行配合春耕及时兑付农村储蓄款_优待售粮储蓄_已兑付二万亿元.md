    People's Bank of China Cooperates with Spring Planting to Timely Cash Rural Savings
    "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" of Two Trillion Yuan Have Been Cashed
    [By this newspaper] Various local branches of the People's Bank of China are actively cashing rural savings to support farmers' spring planting production. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of April, approximately 2.3 trillion yuan in rural savings had been cashed nationwide; among them, approximately 2 trillion yuan in "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" were cashed, accounting for about two-thirds of the original savings amount.
    The "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" promoted by the People's Bank of China in various locations last winter mostly began to mature successively from February of this year. To ensure that farmers' matured deposits are promptly invested in production, local branches of the People's Bank of China actively adopted various convenient and easy-to-implement methods to carry out the cashing work. Ningxia Province adopted methods such as fixed-point cashing, organizing mobile teams, and conducting cashing at markets and materials exchange fairs. By the end of March, it had cashed out over 7.3 billion yuan, accounting for 65.3 percent of the rural savings balance at the end of last year; among them, the amount cashed in Lingwu, Huinong, and other counties reached over 90 percent of the savings balance at the end of last year. Jiangxi Province generally entrusted qualified credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to act as agents for cashing services, and also organized mobile teams to go deep into the countryside to carry out cashing. By the end of March, the province had cashed 107.3 billion yuan, accounting for over 50 percent of the total savings. The People's Bank of China in various locations not only ensured the timely cashing of matured deposits, but also simplified the procedures, thereby further enhancing the prestige of the state bank in rural areas and strengthening the relationship between the state bank and farmers. Many farmers in Kunshan, Jiangsu, and other places said: "Putting surplus money in the state bank is indeed better than keeping it at home." After withdrawing their matured deposits, farmers in various locations have promptly invested the vast majority in spring planting production.

    人民银行配合春耕及时兑付农村储蓄款
    “优待售粮储蓄”已兑付二万亿元
    【本报讯】各地人民银行积极兑付农村储蓄款，支持农民进行春耕生产。据不完全统计，到四月底止，全国已兑付的农村储蓄款约有二万三千亿元；其中兑付“优待售粮储蓄”款约二万亿元，占原储蓄额的三分之二左右。
    各地人民银行在去年冬季举办的“优待售粮储蓄”，从今年二月起大部分已陆续到期。为了使农民的到期存款及时投入生产，各地人民银行积极采用各种方便易行的办法，开展兑付工作。宁夏省采取定点兑付、组织流动组以及在集市与物资交流会上进行兑付的办法，到三月底，已兑出七十三亿余元，为去年年底农村储蓄额的百分之六十五点三；其中灵武、惠农等县兑出的款数，达去年年末储蓄额的百分之九十以上。江西省普遍委托有条件的信用合作社和供销合作社代理兑付业务，同时又组织流动小组深入农村进行兑付，到三月底，全省兑付了一千零七十三亿元，占储蓄总数的百分之五十以上。各地人民银行既作到了及时兑付到期存款，手续又很简便，因而进一步提高了国家银行在农村中的威信，密切了国家银行和农民的关系。江苏崑山等地许多农民说：“把余钱存入国家银行，的确赛过放在家中。”各地农民支取到期存款以后，已将绝大部分及时投入春耕生产。
