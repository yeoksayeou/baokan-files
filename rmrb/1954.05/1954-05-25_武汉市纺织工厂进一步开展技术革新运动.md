    Wuhan Textile Factories Further Promote Technological Innovation Movement
    The broad masses of workers in Wuhan's textile factories are further promoting the technological innovation movement.
    Since the launch of the production increase and economy campaign last year, Wuhan's textile factories have paid attention to mobilizing workers to participate in the technological innovation movement and have achieved considerable results. Ye Kuisheng, a Wuhan model worker and engineer at Yuhua Yarn Factory, researched and modified the old spinning frame, increasing production efficiency by 16.21 percent, which can increase the factory's annual cotton yarn production by more than 3,800 pieces. Jiao Hongfa, an engineer at Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, and Pi Gao Yan, a maintenance worker at Shenxin Yarn Factory, also modified the old spinning frames, improving production and reducing the yarn breakage rate. Tang Yuanyin, director of the steel drawing and roving workshop at the South Yarn Factory of the jointly owned First Textile Factory, proposed a rationalization suggestion to change the drawing frame from three sections to two sections, so that the production of the pre-spinning and post-spinning processes reached equilibrium. Before the "May Day" holiday this year, Wan Yuqi and Ye Kuisheng, engineers at Yuhua Yarn Factory, further researched and improved the cotton distributor of the single-process cotton opener, increasing the utilization rate of the cotton opener equipment from 60 percent to about 96 percent. Wang Demao, director of the weaving workshop at Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, worked with technicians to explore the potential of the old machines, which can increase the factory's annual cotton cloth production by more than 25,000 bolts. You Zhide, a worker at the state-owned First Cotton Textile Factory, improved the lathe tool, increasing efficiency by seven times. Hu Guohua, a young worker at Yuhua Yarn Factory, suggested changing to round piles when making the square piles for the fine yarn spindle winder, and using a milling cutter on a drilling machine instead of manual filing, increasing efficiency by eight times.
    At present, the trade union organizations in various factories are actively rectifying the rationalization proposal organizations, formulating reward measures, and further carrying out mass technological innovation movements. (Dai Wenxian)

    武汉市纺织工厂进一步开展技术革新运动
    武汉市各纺织工厂广大职工，进一步开展技术革新运动。
    从去年开展增产节约竞赛以来，武汉市各纺织厂就注意发动职工参加技术革新运动，并取得不少成绩。武汉市劳动模范、裕华纱厂工程师叶奎声，研究改装了老细纱机，使生产效率提高了百分之十六点二一，全厂每年可增产棉纱三千八百余件。震寰纱厂工程师焦洪发、申新纱厂保全工皮高炎等，也改装了老细纱机，提高了生产，降低了断头率。公私合营第一纺织厂南纱工场钢并粗车间主任汤源荫，提出将并条机由三节改成两节的合理化建议，使前纺、后纺生产达到均衡。今年“五一”节前，裕华纱厂工程师万毓琦、叶奎声进一步研究改进了单程式清花机分棉器，使清花机设备利用率由百分之六十提高到百分之九十六左右。震寰纱厂织布车间主任王德茂，和技术人员共同研究，发挥了老机器的潜在力，全厂每年可增产棉布两万五千多匹。国营第一棉纺织厂工人尤志德，改进车刀，使效率提高了七倍。裕华纱厂青年工人胡国华，在做细纱锭子绞练四方桩子时，建议改用圆桩子，用钻床铣刀代替了人工锉，效率提高了八倍。
    目前，各厂工会组织正积极整顿合理化建议机构，制订奖励办法，进一步开展群众性的技术革新运动。  （戴文娴）
