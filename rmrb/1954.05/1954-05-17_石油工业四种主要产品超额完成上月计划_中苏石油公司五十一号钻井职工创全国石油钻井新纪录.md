    【Report from this newspaper】In April, the national petroleum industry exceeded its production targets for all major products except for fuel oil, which was of relatively poor value. Crude oil exceeded the plan by 9 percent, gasoline by 0.5 percent, kerosene by 6.1 percent, and diesel by 7 percent. Several smaller units that had previously struggled to meet their targets also performed well in April. For example, the Yanchang Oil Mine, by focusing on strengthening planning management and technical management, exceeded its targets for crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, and other products by more than 10 percent.
    In April, several new wells in the Yumen Mining Bureau and the Yanchang Oil Mine came into production, some of which have already reached their designed production capacity. The Yumen Mining Bureau also repaired five old wells, significantly increasing their output.
    In April, many factories and mines launched labor competitions focused on technological innovation. With the help of Soviet experts, all employees of the Yumen Mining Bureau's Oil Extraction Department carried out the arduous task of protecting the oilfield and rationally extracting oil, and the oil-gas ratio has been reduced somewhat. Employees of Petroleum Factory No. 1 put forward more than 800 rationalization proposals to improve operations and balance equipment, and more than 160 of these have already been implemented. After completing the April plan for five major products ahead of schedule, the Wang Kuan team at the Yumen Refinery continued to launch a labor competition to ensure that it overfulfilled the gasoline and kerosene plans for May and the second quarter.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 16th] The No. 51 well drilling team of a mining area of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company drilled 204 meters on May 4th, creating a new national petroleum drilling record after the No. 95 well drilling team's daily progress of 200.35 meters in March. On that day, despite the wind, snow, and muddy conditions on the rig, the technicians of the No. 51 well drilling team worked hard under the leadership of Soviet drilling technician Shaplinov. They adopted a new working method that reduced the time for connecting single drill pipes from 320 minutes to 150 minutes. Driller Turdi Hamiti's team drilled 91 meters in seven hours; Niyaz Ussur's team drilled 68 meters in six hours; and Wei Zhenfu's team drilled 45 meters in four hours. The three teams drilled a total of 204 meters in seventeen hours, achieving an average drilling speed of twelve meters per hour.

    石油工业四种主要产品超额完成上月计划
    中苏石油公司五十一号钻井职工创全国石油钻井新纪录
      【本报讯】全国石油工业四月份各项主要产品，除价值较差的燃料油外，其他四项都超额完成了产量任务。其中原油超过计划百分之九，汽油超过百分之○·五，煤油超过百分之六·一，柴油超过百分之七。过去完成任务不够好的几个较小的单位，四月份也都完成得很好。如延长油矿由于注意加强计划管理和技术管理，原油、汽油、煤油等产品都超额完成任务百分之十以上。
    四月份玉门矿务局和延长油矿各有几口新井投入生产，这些新井有的已达到设计生产能力。玉门矿务局还修好了五口旧井，产量提高了很多。
    四月份不少厂矿展开了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛。玉门矿务局采油处全体职工在苏联专家的帮助下，进行了保护油田、合理采油的艰巨工作，油气比已有所降低。石油一厂职工先后提出了改进操作和平衡设备的合理化建议八百多件，并已实现了一百六十多件。玉门炼油厂王宽小组在提前完成四月份五种主要产品计划后，继续展开了劳动竞赛，保证超额完成五月份和第二季度汽油、煤油计划。
    【新华社乌鲁木齐十六日电】中苏石油公司一个矿区的五十一号井钻井队在五月四日钻进了二百零四公尺，创造了继三月份九十五号井钻井队日进二百点三五公尺以后的又一次全国石油钻井新纪录。那天，风雪交加，井台泥泞，但五十一号井钻井队技工仍在苏联钻井技师沙甫林诺夫领导下努力工作。他们采用了一种新的工作方法，使接单根的钻杆时间由三百二十分钟缩减到一百五十分钟。钻井员吐尔地·哈密提班七小时钻进九十一公尺；尼牙孜·乌素尔班六小时钻进六十八公尺；魏振福班四小时钻进四十五公尺。三个班十七小时共钻进了二百零四公尺，达到每小时平均钻进十二公尺的速度。
