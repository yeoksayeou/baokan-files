Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: Vietnam News Agency, May 19th: A spokesperson for the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement on the 18th, exposing the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force in Indochina for sabotaging the preliminary agreement on evacuating wounded and prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu.

The statement said:

After the Vietnam People's Army liberated Dien Bien Phu, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Geneva Conference, in accordance with the humane policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards enemy prisoners of war and the wounded, immediately took the initiative to express its willingness to release seriously wounded French prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu.

Subsequently, before the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force had made any suggestions, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army again took the initiative to notify it, explaining that our side was prepared to release seriously wounded French prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu.

Therefore, this was a matter of unilateral release of the wounded decided by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam based on humanitarian policy, and not a matter of exchanging prisoners of war or the wounded.

On May 13, the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force sent a delegation headed by Professor Hür to discuss the conditions and methods for transporting French wounded and prisoners of war to Hanoi. The delegation of the French General Command, based on the specific conditions of the Dien Bien Phu airfield and their capabilities, made suggestions, requesting the evacuation of the wounded by helicopters and light aircraft. In the same suggestion, the French General Command promised to cease all aerial activity in the area within ten kilometers around Dien Bien Phu and along Route 41 connecting Dien Bien Phu, Tuần Giáo, and Sơn La. Subsequently, the French delegation returned to Dien Bien Phu and notified that General Cogny had approved these conditions on behalf of General Navarre and handed over the official document signed by General Cogny regarding these suggestions to the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army (full text to be issued separately).

Since the delegation of the French General Command arrived in Dien Bien Phu on May 13, the representative of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army in Dien Bien Phu has consistently complied with the conditions of the agreement between the two sides, and on May 14, transported several French wounded and prisoners of war to the Dien Bien Phu airfield so that they could be quickly transported to Hanoi. However, on May 15, French aircraft did not arrive.

On May 16, instead of sending aircraft to evacuate the wounded waiting at the airfield, the French General Command sent a new delegation headed by Major James. This delegation put forward new suggestions, including repairing the airfield for transport aircraft to land and changing the conditions regarding the activity of French aircraft over Route 41.

While the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army was considering the new suggestions from the French army, the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force announced on May 17 the cancellation of the preliminary agreement on evacuating the wounded and prisoners. Six hours after the above statement was broadcast on the French army "Swallow" radio station in Indochina, that is, while the Vietnam People's Army in Dien Bien Phu was taking care of and treating hundreds of French wounded and prisoners, French bombers carried out activities in the Sơn La-Tuần Giáo area on the evening of May 17 and the morning of May 18.

The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army is willing to expose to world opinion the shameless and agreement-violating actions of the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force on the issue of evacuating the wounded from Dien Bien Phu. These actions violating the agreed-upon conditions once again prove that the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force does not care about the fate of the wounded they abandoned on the battlefield. It should be pointed out that the air raid carried out by French aircraft on May 17, six kilometers from Huân Lý, has already killed fifteen wounded from the French Expeditionary Force. The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army is willing to announce that if any wounded from the French Foreign Legion and North Africa die or are injured again due to French aircraft carrying out air raids on Route 41, the General Command of the French Expeditionary Force will bear full responsibility to the French Expeditionary Force and the French people.

The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army reiterates that despite the violation of the agreement by the French authorities, the Vietnam People's Army will continue to pursue the humane policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards the wounded and prisoners of war, and is prepared to study the suggestions of the French General Command in order to quickly evacuate the wounded from Dien Bien Phu. At the same time, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army still allows the French General Command to transport the wounded according to the conditions already agreed upon by both sides, and allows the airdropping of supplies and medical supplies according to the suggestions of the French General Command.

### 越南人民军总司令部发言人发表声明  斥法军破坏撤运伤俘的初步协议

    越南人民军总司令部发言人发表声明
    斥法军破坏撤运伤俘的初步协议
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人十八日发表了一篇声明，揭露印度支那法国远征军总司令部破坏关于撤运奠边府法军伤俘的初步协议。
    声明说：
    在越南人民军解放奠边府之后，出席日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团本着胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府对待敌军战俘和伤员的人道政策，立刻主动地表示愿意释放奠边府法军重伤战俘。
    此后，在法国远征军总司令部还没有提出任何建议之前，越南人民军总司令部又主动地通知它，说明我方准备释放奠边府法军重伤战俘。
    因此，这是一个越南民主共和国政府基于人道政策而决定由一方释放伤员的问题，而不是一个交换战俘或伤员的问题。
    五月十三日，法国远征军总司令部派了一个以胡尔教授为首的代表团来讨论把法军伤俘运到河内去的条件和方式。法军总司令部代表团根据奠边府飞机场的具体情况和它们的能力提出了建议，要求以直升飞机和轻型飞机撤运伤员。在同一建议中，法军总司令部答应在奠边府周围十公里的地带以及连接奠边府、巡教和山萝的第四十一号公路沿线一带停止一切空中活动。接着，法军代表团回到奠边府通知说，戈涅将军已代表纳瓦尔将军批准这些条件并把戈涅将军签署的关于这些建议的正式文件交给越南人民军总司令部代表团（全文另发）。
    自从法军总司令部代表团在五月十三日来到奠边府以后，越南人民军总司令部在奠边府的代表一直遵守双方协议的条件，并在五月十四日把若干法军伤俘运到奠边府飞机场，以便他们可以迅速地被运到河内去。然而，在五月十五日，法军飞机并没有来。
    五月十六日，法军总司令部没有派飞机来撤运在机场上等候的伤员，而派了一个以詹姆斯少校为首的新代表团来。这个代表团提出了新的建议，包括修理飞机场以便运输机降落和改变关于法军飞机在第四十一号公路上空活动的条件。
      在越南人民军总司令部考虑法军的新建议时，法国远征军总司令部于五月十七日宣布取消关于撤运伤俘的初步协议。在印度支那法军燕子军中电台广播了上述声明后六小时，也就是奠边府越南人民军正在照料和医治数百名法军伤俘的时候，法国轰炸机在五月十七日晚上和五月十八日早晨对山萝—巡教一带进行活动。
    越南人民军总司令部愿向世界舆论揭发法国远征军总司令部在撤运奠边府伤员问题上的无耻的、违反协议的举动。这些违反已获协议的条件的举动又一次证明了：法国远征军总司令部并不关心被他们遗弃在战场上的伤员的命运。应该指出，五月十七日法国飞机在离浑理六公里处进行的空袭已经使法国远征军伤员死了十五名。越南人民军总司令部愿意宣布，如果任何法国外籍军团伤员和北非籍伤员由于法国飞机在第四十一号公路上进行空袭而毙命或再度受伤，法国远征军总司令部应对法国远征军和法国人民负全部责任。
    越南人民军总司令部再次声明，尽管法军当局违反协议，越南人民军仍继续奉行胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府对待伤员和战俘的人道政策，并准备研究法军总司令部的建议，以便迅速撤运奠边府伤员。同时，越南人民军总司令部仍然允许法军总司令部按照双方已经协议的条件运走伤员，并允许按照法军总司令部的建议空投供应品和医药用品。
