The Fighting "Rose"
——An Introduction to the Korean National Art Theater
Lin Yuan

On the evening of May 4th, in the open-air Labor Theater of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, the spring breeze, accompanied by the applause of three to four thousand young people, gently lifted the crimson curtain – the "Rose" dance, performed by the Korean People's Delegation Art Troupe's National Art Theater, once again met the audience in the capital.

The theater was as quiet as midnight, and the sky on the stage gradually revealed the white of dawn. With the sound of a rough guqin, the sleeping roses awakened. The sky became brighter and brighter, and the purplish-red rosebuds, supported by green leaves, slowly opened. They wore morning dew, were bathed in the morning sun, welcomed the gentle breeze, and exuded a intoxicating fragrance. Suddenly, a thunderclap sounded, lightning flashed, and a storm came! Look! How brave and unyielding they are, charging against the storm. They are fighting against the storm, and finally – they have overcome the violent wind and rain, and the golden sunlight once again shines on the earth. The roses, who have won victory and peace, appear more delicate, happier, and lovelier in the fresh air after the rain.

This fighting dance embodies the fighting Korean women, the fighting Korean people, and also precisely embodies the fighting Korean National Art Theater that performs this dance.

The Korean National Art Theater has three parts: a dance troupe, an opera troupe, and a symphony orchestra. Before the war, they had a four-story arc-shaped building, and they happily served the Korean people with peaceful and happy art in this building day and night. In June 1950, the storm of war launched by American imperialism suddenly struck, and their building was bombed. However, just like the "Rose" dance they performed, they fought against the storm. In the winter of 1950, when they retreated to the rear, they performed wherever they went. Wherever the National Art Theater left its footprints, it also left their inspiring songs and dance images. Following the counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they also came to the front line, where they performed on the front lines dozens of meters away from the enemy. In the summer of 1953, after giving a consolation performance to the People's Army on Hill 351, a fierce battle immediately unfolded on that hill. Soon they received a letter from the soldiers on Hill 351 saying, "Inspired by your songs, four heroes emerged from our position." And every time on the Chinese National Day and October 25th – the anniversary of the Volunteers' departure to Korea to resist America and aid Korea, their songs would flutter over the positions of the Volunteers.

In these stormy days, their life and work were extremely difficult: they often marched and performed for two consecutive days and nights, and sometimes they didn't even have food to eat. They used enemy parachutes to make dance dresses; they used copper wire from electrical wires to make strings for musical instruments; they made "Gayageum" themselves, and they practiced dancing in forests and grasslands. No matter how difficult the environment was, they continued to improve their artistic cultivation. In the most difficult time – when retreating to Sinuiju, they also rehearsed the large-scale classical opera "Chunhyangjeon". In the winter of 1952, when the enemy frantically bombed Pyongyang, they began performing the large-scale Soviet opera "The Young Guard", which required one hundred actors and one hundred band members, in the underground theater of Moranbong on the anniversary of the October Revolution. They practiced, performed, immersed themselves in life, and created all at the same time. During the entire war, they created a total of one hundred and fifty programs such as "We Have Won"; and performed a total of two thousand two hundred and fifty times. The audience reached more than 1.3 million people.

Therefore, more than one hundred and eighty people from the Korean National Art Theater won military medals; more than forty people won third-class National Flag Medals; seven people won second-class National Flag Medals; and three people won Merit Medals. In Korea, the National Art Theater is the art troupe with the most medals. Flowers of honor are piled up in front of each of them.

After the ceasefire, they practiced and performed while doing restoration work. They guaranteed eight hours of professional study and two hours of voluntary labor every day. They filled in the bomb craters around the theater and cleared the ruins inside and outside the theater. Pianists and violinists did the work of picking and carrying bricks and stones in order to protect the sensitivity of their fingertips. They not only had to ensure that their theater was repaired, but also had to ensure that they played more moving music.

In addition to preparing to restore the original theater, they have planned to build a magnificent opera house capable of accommodating two thousand people at the intersection of Stalin Road and International Road in the future. At the same time, after the ceasefire, they began building a palace-style theater with a revolving stage on Moranbong. They plan to stage the famous Soviet classical opera "Ivan Susanin" in this theater this summer. Now, the theater is under construction, with the roof being built and the doors and windows being installed.

      On the stage of the Labor Theater, the crimson curtain opened and closed, opened and closed, and in a burst of torrential applause, the magnificent and powerful "Song of Construction" was raised:
          Ekiyeon! Ekiyeon! Ekiyeon!
        Look up at that city! It is a heroic city,
        Although it was bombed by the enemy and turned into ruins,
        But the people on this land defended it with their flesh and blood;
          We will rebuild it more beautifully.
      Yes, the magnificent theater is about to be rebuilt. The Korean National Art Theater, just like the fighting "Rose" it performs, has won victory and peace, and is advancing towards a tomorrow of higher artistic achievement!

    战斗的“蔷薇”
    ——朝鲜国立艺术剧场介绍
    林元
    五月四日的晚上，在北京劳动人民文化宫露天的劳动剧场里，春风伴着三四千青年的掌声，轻轻地掀开了绛色的帷幕——朝鲜人民访华代表团艺术团国立艺术剧场演出的“蔷薇”舞，又一度跟首都的观众见面了。
    剧场里像子夜一样恬静，舞台上的天幕渐渐现出鱼肚白的黎明的天色，随着一声粗旷的古琴的声音，酣睡着的蔷薇花苏醒过来。天色越来越亮，一片绿叶扶衬着的紫红色蔷薇的花苞慢慢开放了。她们带着晨露，披着朝阳，迎着轻风，散发出醉人的芬香。突然，一声雷响，电光四射，狂风暴雨来了！看！她们多么勇敢倔强，迎着风暴冲上去了，她们跟风暴战斗着，终于——她们战胜了狂暴的风雨，金色的阳光又普照着大地。赢得了胜利，赢得了和平的蔷薇花，在雨后清新的空气里，显得更娇艳，更幸福，更可爱了。
    这个战斗的舞蹈，体现了战斗的朝鲜妇女，体现了战斗的朝鲜人民，也正恰恰地体现了演出这个舞蹈的战斗的朝鲜国立艺术剧场。
          　×　×　×
    朝鲜国立艺术剧场，有舞蹈团、歌剧团、交响乐团三个部分。在战前，他们有一座四层楼的弧形大厦，他们日夜快乐地在这座大厦里用和平幸福的艺术为朝鲜人民服务。一九五○年六月，美帝国主义掀起的战争风暴突然袭来了，他们的大厦被炸毁了，可是，正像他们演出的“蔷薇”舞一样，他们迎着风暴战斗着。一九五○年冬天，他们向后方撤退时，他们走到那里就演到那里，凡是有国立艺术剧场足迹的地方，也就留下了他们鼓舞人心的歌声和舞蹈形象。随着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的反攻，他们也到前线来了，他们在离敌人几十公尺的前沿阵地上表演。一九五三年夏天，他们在三五一高地给人民军慰问演出后，接着那个高地就展开了激烈的战斗；不久他们接到三五一高地的战士们来信说：“在你们的歌声鼓舞下，我们的阵地出了四位英雄。”而每逢中国人民的国庆节日和十月二十五日——志愿军出国抗美援朝纪念日，志愿军的阵地上就会飘扬起他们的歌声。
    在这些暴风雨的日子里，他们的生活和工作是极端艰苦的：常常接连两昼夜行军和演出，有时还吃不到饭。他们拿敌人的降落伞做舞蹈的衣裙；他们用电线里的铜丝做乐器的弦；他们自己制造“伽倻琴”，他们利用林间和草地练习舞蹈。不管环境多么艰苦，他们仍旧不断地在提高自己的艺术修养。他们在最艰难的时候——撤退到新义州时，还排演了大型的古典歌剧“春香传”。一九五二年冬天，敌人疯狂轰炸平壤时，他们却在十月革命节那天，在牡丹峰地下剧场开始演出需要一百个演员、一百个乐队手的苏联大型歌剧“青年近卫军”。他们一面练习，一面演出，一面深入生活，一面创作。在整个战争时期，他们一共创作了“我们胜利了”等一百五十个节目；共演出了二千二百五十次。观众达一百三十多万人。
    因此，朝鲜国立艺术剧场有一百八十多人荣获了军功章；有四十多人荣获了三级国旗勋章；有七人荣获了二级国旗勋章；有三人荣获了功劳勋章。在朝鲜，国立艺术剧场是一个获得勋章最多的艺术团体，荣誉的鲜花，堆满在他们的每一个人的跟前。
    停战后，他们一边练习和演出，一边做着恢复的工作。他们每天保证八小时的业务学习，和两小时的义务劳动。他们填平了剧场四周的弹坑，清理了剧场内外的废墟。钢琴和提琴手，为了保护指端的敏感，便做着挑、抬砖石的工作。他们不但要保证修理好自己的剧院，还要保证演奏出更动人的乐曲。
    他们除了准备修复原来的剧场外，已计划在将来的斯大林路和国际路交叉的地方，建筑一座能容纳两千人的富丽堂皇的大歌剧院。同时，停战后，他们便已在牡丹峰开始建筑一座有旋转舞台的、宫殿式的剧场。他们打算今年的夏天，在这个剧场里，上演苏联的著名古典歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”。现在，这个剧场正在建筑着楼顶和安装着门窗。
          ×　×　×
      劳动剧场的舞台上，绛色的帷幕，掀开又闭上，掀开又闭上，在一阵骤雨般的掌声里，扬起了雄壮有力的“建设之歌”：
          俄基永！俄基永！俄基永！
        望上那城呀！是英雄的城，
        虽被敌人轰击而成了废墟，
        但是这土地上的人民以血肉保卫了它；
          我们会重新把它建设得更美丽。
      是的，富丽的剧场快要重新建设起来了，朝鲜国立艺术剧场，正像它演出的战斗的“蔷薇”一样，赢得了胜利，赢得了和平，正向着更高的艺术成就的明天前进！
