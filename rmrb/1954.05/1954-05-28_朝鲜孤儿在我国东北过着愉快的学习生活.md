Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 27th: Three thousand four hundred and nine Korean orphans are leading happy and fulfilling learning lives in the six secondary schools established for them in Northeast China. This autumn, five more secondary schools will be completed, enabling all of the more than 22,000 Korean orphans being cared for in China to receive secondary education successively.

In the autumn of 1952, Korean orphans were invited to come to China. In 1953, the Chinese government successively established six secondary schools in the provinces of Jilin, Songjiang, Liaoxi, Liaodong, and Heilongjiang. Over the past year, the students in these secondary schools have made rapid progress in all aspects. Under the slogan of "Striving to learn for the restoration of peaceful life in the motherland," they are studying diligently according to the educational system and textbooks of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Currently, in each secondary school, a total average score of 4 or above is achieved by 60 percent of the students; in some schools, 80 percent of the students achieve this level of performance. These students also enthusiastically participate in local social activities, frequently holding recreational and sports competitions with Chinese students, going on picnics and gatherings together, and carrying out voluntary labor for school construction and tree planting activities.

    朝鲜孤儿在我国东北过着愉快的学习生活
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】在我国东北地区为朝鲜孤儿建立的六所中等学院中，有三千四百零九名朝鲜孤儿正过着幸福愉快的学习生活。今年秋季将有五所中等学院继续建成，可使来我国抚养的两万二千多名朝鲜孤儿都能先后受到中等教育。
    一九五二年秋天，朝鲜孤儿们应邀来到我国。一九五三年，我国政府便在吉林、松江、辽西、辽东、黑龙江等省先后建立了六所中等学院。一年来，这些中等学院的学生在各方面都有了飞跃的进步。他们在“为恢复祖国和平生活而奋勇学习”的口号下，按照朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的教育制度和教材，进行着刻苦的学习。目前，各中等学院中共有百分之六十的学生总平均分数达到四分以上；有的学院有百分之八十的学生达到这种成绩。这些学生还热情地参加当地的社会活动，经常和中国学生举行文娱、体育竞赛，在一起野游和联欢，并开展了建校的义务劳动和植树运动。
