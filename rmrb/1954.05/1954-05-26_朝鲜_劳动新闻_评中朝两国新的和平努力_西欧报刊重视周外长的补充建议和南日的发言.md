Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: The "Labor News" of Korea published an editorial on the 24th, stating that the important speeches made by Foreign Minister Nam Il and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference on May 22nd demonstrate new sincere efforts to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The editorial pointed out: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has long proposed a just plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. All foreign troops must be withdrawn from Korea simultaneously. The presence of foreign troops in Korea is incompatible with the task of holding free all-Korean elections and completing the unified state on a democratic basis. Resolving the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea is one of the urgent tasks of the Geneva Conference. Moreover, free all-Korean elections must be held. This is our firm and unwavering stance. However, representatives of some countries, led by the United States, are attempting to impose the illegally passed United Nations resolutions on us.

The editorial continued: The fact that the United Nations was a belligerent party in the Korean War shows that the United Nations has long lost its ability to act as an impartial international body. The attempt by the American imperialists to have the United Nations supervise the Korean elections in order to extend the anti-people puppet regime they established in South Korea to North Korea is absolutely unworkable.

The editorial stated: At the Geneva Conference on May 22nd, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai put forward a new proposal, suggesting the establishment of a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to supervise the all-Korean elections in order to assist the All-Korean Committee in holding the all-Korean elections. Foreign Minister Nam Il expressed full agreement with this proposal and emphasized that this is international supervision that does not violate the principle of non-interference by foreign countries in Korea's internal affairs.

The editorial concluded: The new efforts made by China and Korea to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will be warmly supported by the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 24th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal at the plenary session on the Korean issue on the 22nd regarding the establishment of a "Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea to supervise the all-Korean elections" and Foreign Minister Nam Il's speech have further provided favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is also reflected in many newspapers here and in Western Europe on the 23rd and 24th. The "Swiss Newspaper" reported on the 23rd that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal "is considered by the sixteen non-communist countries as an important step towards a political solution to the Korean issue." The Geneva "Voice of Labor" said on the 24th that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal on the 22nd was a new and important proposal. The newspaper wrote: Due to the suggestions put forward by the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supplemented by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, "they are obviously reasonable and in line with justice and peace, so that those who reject these suggestions have not put forward any serious arguments against them." The Bern "Solidarity Newspaper" stated on the 24th that Foreign Minister Nam Il's speech and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal "aroused great interest among French officials and were considered worthy of serious consideration; a British speaker was unwilling to completely reject them, while an American speaker was unwilling to take this international supervision as a basis for discussion." The newspaper believed that the speech of the South Korean representative at the same meeting "did not contain much new information." The Paris "Combat" wrote on the 24th: "Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal provides an important factor to ensure the conference moves forward." The Paris "Liberation" stated on the 24th that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal and Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal regarding holding all-Korean elections in proportion to the population "mark the sincerity of their desire to reach an agreement."

The "Humanité" stated on the 24th that thanks to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal, "the road to solving the Korean issue has been opened."

Certain British and American newspapers are attempting to belittle the great significance of this rational new proposal by China and Korea for further discussion of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The American imperialist mouthpiece "New York Herald Tribune" (Paris edition) went so far as to distort the facts, saying: "The Korean phase of the Geneva Conference rapidly moved towards an open breakdown last night, and the Indochina negotiations scheduled to resume tomorrow seem destined for the same fate." This clearly instructed distorted report should arouse the attention of all those who hope for a peaceful solution.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”评中朝两国新的和平努力
    西欧报刊重视周外长的补充建议和南日的发言
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】“劳动新闻”二十四日发表社论说：在日内瓦会议五月二十二日会议上，南日外务相和周恩来外交部长关于朝鲜问题的重要发言，表现了为促进朝鲜问题和平解决而作的新的真诚的努力。
    社论指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团早已提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正当方案。必须从朝鲜同时撤退一切外国军队。外国军队驻在朝鲜境内，是与实行全朝鲜自由选举以及在民主的基础上完成统一国家的任务不能相容的。解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的问题，是日内瓦会议的迫切的任务之一。而且，必须举行全朝鲜的自由选举。这就是我们的坚定不移的立场。但是，以美国为首的一部分国家代表却企图把非法通过的联合国决议强加于我们。
    社论接着说：联合国作为朝鲜战争中的交战一方这一事实说明，联合国早已丧失了作为一个公正的国际机构采取行动的能力。美帝国主义者要使联合国监督朝鲜选举，以把他们在南朝鲜建立的反人民的傀儡制度扩展到北朝鲜，这种企图是绝对行不通的。
    社论说：在五月二十二日的日内瓦会议上，周恩来外交部长提出了新建议，建议为了协助全朝鲜委员会举行全朝鲜选举，成立中立国监察委员会，对全朝鲜选举进行监察。南日外务相对于这一建议表示完全同意，并强调指出，这是不违反外国不得干涉朝鲜内政的原则的国际监察。
    社论最后说：朝中两国为促进和平解决朝鲜问题而作的新的努力，将受到朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。
    【新华社日内瓦二十四日电】周恩来外长在二十二日关于朝鲜问题的全体会议上所提出的在朝鲜
  “成立中立国监察委员会，对全朝鲜选举进行监察”的补充建议和南日外务相的发言，为和平解决朝鲜问题进一步提供了有利的条件。这一点，在二十三日和二十四日此间和西欧的许多报纸中间也有反映。“瑞士报”二十三日报道，周恩来外长的建议“在十六个非共产党国家方面认为是趋向朝鲜问题政治解决的重要的一步。”日内瓦“工人之声报”二十四日说，周恩来外长二十二日的建议是一个新的重要的提案。该报写道：由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表提出的并由中国周恩来外长所补充的建议，“显然是合理的和符合于正义与和平的，以致那些拒绝这些建议的人们也没有提出任何反对这些建议的严重的论据。”伯尔尼“团结报”二十四日称，南日外务相的发言和周恩来外长的补充建议，
  “在法国官方人士中很感兴趣，并认为值得认真考虑，一个英国发言人不愿完全拒绝，而美国发言人不愿意以这种国际监督作为讨论的基础。”该报对于同日会上南朝鲜代表的发言认为“没有多少新的东西”。巴黎“战斗报”二十四日写道：“周恩来外长的补充建议提供了一个保证会议前进一步的重要因素。”巴黎“解放报”二十四日称：周恩来外长的建议和南日外务相关于按人口比例举行全朝鲜选举的建议，“标志着他们想达成协议的愿望的真诚”。
  “人道报”二十四日称：由于周恩来外长的建议，
  “通向解决朝鲜问题的道路已被打开”。
    某些英美报纸企图贬低中朝两国这一合理的新建议对于进一步讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的重大意义。美帝国主义喉舌“纽约先驱论坛报”巴黎版不惜颠倒是非地说：“日内瓦会议的朝鲜阶段昨天晚上迅速走向公开的破裂，而定于明日复会的印度支那的谈判似已注定同样的命运。”这种显系授意的歪曲报道，应该引起一切希望和平解决的人们的注意。
