    The letter said: "The Syrian people see that Syria, like all other Middle Eastern countries, has become the center of activity for American spies and various missions from the United States and its allies. The Syrian people are concerned about their fate, believing that all of this increases the threat of another world war. Therefore, they have always and will continue to resolutely oppose the policy of forming blocs and concluding military pacts. The Syrian people, along with the people of other countries, demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. They believe that the Geneva Conference is a great victory for the determination of the people of all countries to strengthen peace and oppose preparations for another war. They place great hope in this conference."

    叙利亚举行全国各地代表参加的和平集会
    致函日内瓦会议要求结束印度支那战争
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特十日讯：叙利亚各地人民代表数千人参加了在大马士革举行的一次和平集会。参加集会的还有以黎巴嫩和平委员会主席、世界和平理事会常务委员会委员安托瓦·塔伯特为首的黎巴嫩和平拥护者的代表团，以及世界和平理事会理事侯赛尼·赛疆、乔治·汉纳和马托克博士等。这次大会是叙利亚和平运动史上最大的一次集会，会上群众的情绪十分高涨，它给叙利亚和黎巴嫩各阶层人民留下很深的印象。
    会议厅中装饰着“和平——各国人民的希望——万岁！”“各国人民要求禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器”“通过和平协商的办法解决一切国际争端”等标语。
    叙利亚和平委员会委员、工程师伊桑·贾布里在会上强调指出和平运动受到叙利亚各阶层人民的拥护。他说：“叙利亚已有三十万公民在要求禁止原子武器和缔结五大国公约的呼吁书上签名。”
    大马士革和平委员会委员艾哈迈德·阿巴扎斥责帝国主义者的军事联盟和军事协定。他说：叙利亚人民也像阿拉伯各国的人民一样，将为反对帝国主义者的一切阴谋而继续奋斗。
    会上宣读了大马士革回教教主阿施马尔的声明。声明说：“凡是企图发动国际战争或者准备发动这种战争的人，我们都将认为他是敌人。”阿施马尔在声明中也要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器。
    阿勒颇和平拥护者代表、律师艾哈迈德·穆迪·霍德尔强烈抗议帝国主义国家要把叙利亚变成他们的军事基地的企图。他强调说，朝鲜人民的斗争已经向全世界说明亚洲并不是帝国主义者可以轻易攫取的。当他宣布越南人民军已经解放奠边府时，会场上响起了热烈的掌声。
    会上宣读了叙利亚议员阿卜杜拉蒂弗·约尼斯的声明。他向叙利亚和平运动致贺，并严厉抨击了帝国主义、首先是美帝国主义在阿拉伯国家的阴谋。世界和平理事会理事乔治·汉纳代表黎巴嫩和平拥护者向大会致贺。他在发言中指出，和平运动包括了黎巴嫩的各阶层人民。他也谴责了美帝国主义者的罪恶的、侵略性的军事计划。
    工程师阿卜杜勒·贾瓦德·夏金代表叙利亚和平委员会宣读了致日内瓦会议的信。信中要求所有的与会者本着和平解决所有国际争端的精神行事，并要求结束印度支那战争。
    信中说：“叙利亚人民看到叙利亚像所有其它中东国家一样，已经成为美国间谍以及美国及其盟国的各种使团活动的中心。叙利亚人民担忧他们的命运，认为这一切都增加了另一次世界大战的威胁。所以他们一向并仍将坚决反对结成集团和缔结军事公约的政策。叙利亚人民和其它各国人民一道，要求禁止原子武器和氢武器。他们认为日内瓦会议是各国人民要求加强和平和反对准备另一次战争的决心的巨大胜利。他们对这个会议寄予很大的希望。”
