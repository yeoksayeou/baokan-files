Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 29th (TASS dispatch)

Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

It has been decided to discuss two issues at this Geneva Conference: first, the peaceful settlement of the Korean question; second, the restoration of peace in Indochina.

It can be said that the Geneva Conference is a conference on Asian issues. Both the Korean question and the Indochina question are among the most important issues in Asia.

In light of this, we cannot fail to notice the fact that only a few Asian countries are participating in this conference. Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Pakistan are not participating in our conference, although their participation would greatly benefit the progress of our work. We cannot but feel the loss caused by this situation.

At the same time, we should not underestimate the fact that all the major powers—France, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union—are participating in this conference, which is the first time this has happened in recent years. In this regard, it should be particularly emphasized that the People's Republic of China, as a major Asian power, will be able to contribute to the work of our conference on the aforementioned important issues concerning the situation in Asia. This conference has already begun its work on the Korean question in its current composition.

The problem we face is the establishment of a unified and independent Korea through peaceful means. The resolution of this problem is of great importance to the Korean people and will be an important factor in easing international tensions.

Logically speaking, the settlement of the Korean question is primarily a matter for the Korean people themselves. Any solution imposed on the Korean people by other countries cannot satisfy the Korean people and cannot contribute to a lasting solution of the Korean question.

We cannot fail to consider the history of Korea, especially the history of the Korean people's struggle for their independence.

It should be pointed out that at the beginning of this century, Japanese imperialists, with the support of certain other countries, first turned Korea into their protectorate, and then seized the country, completely controlling the Korean peninsula. This policy of imperialist aggression was bound to be met with resistance from the Korean people. The Korean people's struggle for independence and freedom was arduous and required sacrifices. This struggle lasted for many years. However, in our time, such a policy of aggression is bound to be met with the resolute resistance of people determined to defend their independence and freedom. As everyone knows, after occupying Korea, Japanese imperialists turned the Korean peninsula into the main springboard for their piecemeal aggression against China and the Chinese people. They tried to extend their rule to the whole of China and to the whole of Southeast Asia. To achieve this goal, they formed an alliance with Hitler's Germany and concluded the so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact," and under the pretext of "opposing communism," they conspired with German imperialists to divide the world.

Everyone remembers what the result was. In the autumn of 1945, Japanese militarists were defeated and driven back to their lair. Only then was Korea able to break free from the rule of Japanese militarism and begin a new life of freedom and independence.

Shortly after Korea was liberated from Japanese occupation, due to a military situation, Korea was divided into two parts—North Korea and South Korea. Therefore, the Korean people were faced with the problem of restoring the unification of their country and establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state. This problem was not resolved in the years following the end of World War II. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, established in the northern territory of Korea, implemented many significant democratic reforms during these years, including measures to transfer the land of landlords and former Japanese imperialist running dogs to the peasants. Due to the war imposed from the outside and the barbaric military intervention by the United States under the banner of the United Nations for three years, this constructive activity, which was in the interests of the Korean people, was interrupted.

After the Korean Armistice Agreement was concluded in the summer of 1953, the issue of restoring Korea's unification and establishing a unified Korean state on a democratic basis was raised again.

The most important task of the Geneva Conference is to help the Korean people restore the unification of Korea. We must do everything we can to enable the Korean people to find peaceful ways to establish a unified, independent, and democratic state. All countries that hope to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. On the other hand, we cannot fail to note that the United Nations, under pressure from certain countries, has adopted an unjust attitude and has proven itself incapable of resolving the Korean question. Just one example is enough to illustrate the problem: in the past four years, the United Nations has never once listened to the opinions of representatives from North Korea.

As for the fictitious statements about the Korean events that the US representative has repeatedly repeated here, these statements have been repeatedly refuted and exposed as false by the Soviet representative in the United Nations.

When discussing the Korean question, we cannot fail to consider the fundamental changes that have recently taken place in the political situation in Asian countries, especially since the end of World War II.

As everyone knows, for many years, even for hundreds of years in some countries, Asian countries were ruled by other non-Asian countries, and the people of these countries were deprived of the opportunity to decide their own destiny. This situation was the result of certain countries pursuing aggressive imperialist policies. However, this policy has long been discredited. At present, it is increasingly clear that pursuing outdated colonial policies is doomed to failure.

This situation should be remembered when discussing the Korean question and the Indochina question at the Geneva Conference.

The people of Asian countries have achieved great success in their struggle for independence and liberation from foreign rule. This fact can no longer be ignored. The total population of the world is about 2.4 billion. The majority of the world's population lives on the land of Asia. But the vast majority of the Asian people were in a state of colonial, semi-colonial, or dependent status from the beginning of the 20th century.

Since then, fundamental changes have taken place in Asia.

In this regard, the decisive shift occurred after the Russian Socialist Revolution in 1917, after the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and after the Soviet Union abandoned the Tsar's imperialist policies and based its relations with other countries on the principle of recognizing the national freedom and independence of other countries. This new situation could not but inspire those peoples who had been fighting for their national freedom and independence for centuries.

Those who hold outdated views cannot understand the historical changes that have taken place in Asian countries. For example, sometimes they look at these developments from a completely wrong angle. They are often focused on "communist conspiracies" and "agents of the Kremlin," etc. These people attribute all the movements of oppressed peoples to strive for freedom and national independence to communism, thus they, against their own will, enhance the prestige of the communists -- even on issues that have nothing to do with the communists. They have not taken into account that the self-sacrificing struggles of people with different political views and beliefs for national freedom and independence are in fact promoted by their aspiration for liberation from foreign rule and liberation from colonial shackles. As for the views and beliefs of the Soviet people, we also do not conceal our sympathy and warm feelings for the national liberation movements of all peoples—including the Asian peoples.

The highest expression of the fundamental political changes in Asia is first of all in China, with a population of more than 500 million. Now the People's Republic of China has been established, and a solid foundation for a people's democratic system has been laid there. It is absurd to ignore this fact. The social, economic, and political changes in China are visible to everyone, and to fail to take this into account is to disregard events of the greatest historical significance.

Furthermore, who can deny that a country like India, with a population of more than 300 million, has entered the historical stage? Just recently, India was still a colony, but now no one can deny that India's position is becoming increasingly prominent among countries that defend national independence and strive to occupy an important position in international affairs. The importance of countries such as Indonesia and Burma is constantly increasing.

This is not to say that establishing true independence in these countries is a smooth task, and there are no struggles or difficulties in relations with certain countries. But all this proves one fact: Asia has indeed undergone tremendous and historically significant changes. This is a fact that must be considered when considering any issues currently related to Asian countries.

It is necessary to talk about the issue of China, which occupies a special position in international affairs.

The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have established a solid friendly relationship, and I am not revealing any secrets by saying this. Many other countries have also established political and economic relations with the People's Republic of China. As everyone knows, countries like the United Kingdom attach great importance to developing relations with the People's Republic of China. Everyone also knows that there are many other countries that have not established normal relations with the People's Republic of China, the only reason being that external forces are hindering them from doing so.

As for the United States of America, the government of that country has openly adopted an aggressive policy towards the People's Republic of China. This aggressive policy of the United States is simultaneously affecting the entire situation in Asia today.

The People's Republic of China has not taken aggressive action against the United States of America, which is known to everyone. But when it comes to the US policy towards the People's Republic of China, the situation is completely different.

Since the day the Chinese people drove the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek clique—servants of foreign capital who did not care about the needs of the Chinese people—out of their territory and established the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of China has been subjected to one act of aggression after another. In this regard, the US ruling circles should bear the primary responsibility.

They occupied Taiwan, supporting the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique as the masters of Taiwan. They used all impermissible means to prevent the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate position in the United Nations. In addition, they forced the United Nations to pass a resolution on an embargo, prohibiting trade with China. They are planning to rebuild the Japanese army, thus creating a threat to China. They condemned China for aggression in Korea, although it was only due to feelings of completely natural friendship for the Korean people who were fighting for national freedom, especially because foreign aggressive forces approached the Chinese border, that the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the war to aid the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the interests of Chinese security. The US ruling circles are openly planning aggression against the People's Republic of China, constantly maintaining the threat of attacking the Chinese border from Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula, and constantly establishing new military bases on Pacific islands and in areas near the Chinese border such as Pakistan, but the US ruling circles say that China is the aggressor, and the United States is not.

Recently, under the pretext of protecting several puppet regimes in Indochina, a plan to establish a military group in Southeast Asia has been formulated, even though not a single self-respecting Asian country is prepared to participate in this military group. This plan once again exposes the conspiracy of colonial countries to use some Asian countries to oppose other Asian countries.

Some countries in Asia, first of all China, are embarking on a new democratic path of national and social rebirth that is unique to our progressive and democratic era. But at a time when such a significant event is taking place, certain groups in the United States are clinging to the old, attempting to maintain the colonial system and semi-colonial system.

However, those countries that still regard maintaining the reactionary groups and colonial system in Asia as their mission will never be able to continue their old policies because they are unwilling to face up to the developing historical changes of the Asian people. The hostile policy adopted by the United States towards the People's Republic of China is extremely harmful to the resolution of the current problems in Asia. This aggressive policy has no future because it violates the entire historical development process in Asia and everywhere else, and this policy is the main obstacle currently hindering the resolution of the current problems in Asia based on the principles of freedom and national rights of all peoples.

The recent speeches by the US Secretary of State on the situation in Asia show how stubbornly some groups intend to preserve what has already died and continue to pursue outdated imperialist colonial policies.

The American newspaper published Secretary of State Dulles' statement on April 16. In his statement, Dulles described the establishment of the People's Republic of China, which the Chinese people promoted according to their free will, as a "huge disaster" that caused "the loss of the Chinese mainland." The statement also said: "The disaster would be even more serious if we lost the vast economic resources and strategic position of the millions of people in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands."

This statement by the American politician does not mention the interests and rights of the people of China, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands at all. But the statement clearly shows how they are trying every possible means to prevent the great Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries from entering a new free life and entering a democratic system from their past colonial and semi-colonial lives. The statement describes the fundamental changes taking place in China as "loss," although China has never belonged to anyone and has never intended to belong to any foreign country. It is clear that the argument of the so-called "loss of the Chinese mainland" shows that they want to cling to outdated imperialist colonial policies, and this argument has nothing in common with the principle of recognizing the freedom and national rights of all peoples. Yet the US representative still makes superficial arguments here about communism and the principles of freedom.

The Geneva Conference provides an opportunity to comprehensively study these Asian issues—recognized as the most pressing issues at present.

Here, we have the opportunity to listen to various opinions, and after exchanging opinions, we can find solutions to the problems raised here that are in line with the interests of the people of the countries concerned, as well as with the interests of progress and the consolidation of peace. For example, taking such a method on the Korean question can help in many ways to resolve the issue of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korea in a peaceful way, and can achieve the goal of a truly peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

If the Geneva Conference is based on the principle that the Asian people have every right to solve their own affairs themselves, and that this is primarily their own business, then the conference will be able to achieve this goal.

Other countries, including those participating in the Geneva Conference, have a responsibility to help the Asian people in this regard with their friendly efforts.

Understanding the current tasks of the conference in this way is most in line with the interests of the freedom and national movements of the Asian people, and it is also in line with the interests of consolidating peace in Asia and world peace. If the Geneva Conference can achieve positive results, it will also help to solve other problems that are not only related to Asia.

Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, spoke here about hoping that all Asian countries will work together to achieve peace in Asia.

The Soviet delegation fully agrees with this opinion. Whether they are European countries or Asian countries, they should take steps that are conducive to consolidating peace in Europe, Asia, and the whole world.

The conference heard the speech of the South Korean representative, but he did not put forward any positive and concrete suggestions in his clumsy speech.

The opinions of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question have also been put forward here.

The Soviet delegation believes that the proposals put forward by Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, can be used as a basis for adopting appropriate decisions on the Korean question.

These proposals are in line with the national aspirations of the Korean people to restore the unification of their country, and are in line with the interests of consolidating international peace.

### 在日内瓦会议四月二十九日会议上  莫洛托夫关于朝鲜问题的发言

专栏：

    在日内瓦会议四月二十九日会议上
    莫洛托夫关于朝鲜问题的发言主席先生，代表先生们：
    已经决定在这个日内瓦会议上讨论两个问题：第一，朝鲜问题的和平解决；第二，恢复印度支那和平问题。
    可以说日内瓦会议是一个关于亚洲问题的会议。朝鲜问题和印度支那问题都是属于亚洲的最重要问题之列的。
    由此看来，我们不能不注意到只有少数亚洲国家参加这个会议这一事实。像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦等这些亚洲国家都没有参加我们的会议，虽然它们的参加会大大有利于工作的进行。我们不能不感到这种情况所造成的损失。
    同时，我们不应该低估这样一个事实：所有的大国——法国、英国、美利坚合众国、中华人民共和国和苏联——都参加了这个会议，在近年来这还是第一次。在这方面，特别应该强调的是，亚洲的大国——中华人民共和国将能够对我们的会议在上述有关亚洲局势的重要问题方面的工作作出贡献。这个会议已经按目前的组成形式开始了关于朝鲜问题的工作。
    我们面临的问题是通过和平方式建立一个统一、独立的朝鲜的问题。这个问题的解决对朝鲜人民有极大的重要意义，同时将是缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要因素。
    按道理说，朝鲜问题的解决主要是朝鲜人民自己的事情。其他国家强加于朝鲜人民的任何解决办法都不能满足朝鲜人民，也不能有助于朝鲜问题的持久解决。
    我们不能不考虑到朝鲜的历史，特别是朝鲜人民为他们的独立而进行斗争的历史。
    应该指出，在本世纪初，日本帝国主义者在某些其他国家的支持下，始而把朝鲜变成他们的保护国，接着就强占了这个国家，完全控制了朝鲜半岛。这种帝国主义侵略政策必然会遇到朝鲜人民的反抗。朝鲜人民争取独立和自由的斗争是艰苦的并且需要付出牺牲。这个斗争进行了许多年。但是，在我们的时代，这种侵略政策必然会遇到决心保卫自己的独立与自由的人民的坚决反抗。大家知道，日本帝国主义者在强占了朝鲜以后，就把朝鲜半岛变成了对中国、对中国人民进行得寸进尺的侵略的主要跳板。他们竭力想把他们的统治扩大到整个中国、扩大到整个东南亚。为了达到这个目的，他们和希特勒德国结成了同盟，缔结了所谓“反共产国际协定”，并以“反对共产主义”为借口，阴谋和德国帝国主义者瓜分全世界。
    它的结果怎样，大家都还记得。一九四五年秋天，日本军国主义者遭受了失败并被打退到老巢去了。于是朝鲜才能够摆脱日本军国主义的统治并开始过着自由、独立的新生活。
    在朝鲜从日本占领下获得解放后不久，由于一种军事性质的情况，朝鲜被分成了两部分——北朝鲜和南朝鲜，因此，朝鲜人民就面临着恢复他们国家的统一和建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的问题。这个问题在第二次世界大战结束以后的几年中没有得到解决。在北部朝鲜领土上建立的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在这几年中实行了许多意义非常重大的民主改革，其中包括把地主和前日本帝国主义者走狗的土地交给农民的措施。由于外面强加的战争和美国打着联合国旗号进行了三年的野蛮的军事干涉，这种符合朝鲜人民利益的建设性活动中断了。
    一九五三年夏天朝鲜停战协定缔结以后，恢复朝鲜的统一和在民主基础上建立一个统一的朝鲜国家的问题再一次提出了。
    日内瓦会议最重要的任务就是帮助朝鲜人民恢复朝鲜的统一。我们必须尽一切力量来使朝鲜人民找到和平的方法来建立一个统一的、独立的、民主的国家。一切希望缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的国家都关心朝鲜问题的和平解决。另一方面，我们不能不注意到，联合国组织在某些国家的压力下，采取了不公正的态度，并且证明它没有能力解决朝鲜问题。只要举一个例子就足够说明问题了：在过去四年中，联合国一次也没有听取北朝鲜代表的意见。
    至于美国代表在这里一再重复的关于朝鲜事件的虚构的说法，这种说法已一再在联合国中受到苏联代表的驳斥并被揭露了它的虚假性。
    在讨论朝鲜问题的时候，我们不能不考虑到亚洲国家政治形势中最近发生的基本变化，特别是第二次世界大战结束以后的变化。
    大家知道，许多年来，在某些国家甚至是几百年来，亚洲国家受到其他非亚洲国家的统治，这些国家的人民被剥夺了决定他们自己的命运的机会。这种情况是某些国家奉行侵略性的帝国主义政策的结果。然而这种政策早已是声名扫地了。在目前，奉行陈旧的殖民政策要遭到失败这一点，是越来越明显了。
    在日内瓦会议上，在讨论朝鲜问题与印度支那问题的时候应该记住这种情况。
    亚洲各国人民在争取独立与自外国统治下解放的斗争中已经取得了巨大的成就。对于这个事实不能再加忽视。全世界人口共约二十四亿。全世界人口中的大部分住在亚洲土地上。但是亚洲人民中的绝大多数从二十世纪一开头起就处在殖民地、半殖民地或是附属国的地位。
    在此以后，亚洲发生了根本的变化。
    在这方面，决定性的转变是发生在一九一七年俄国社会主义革命以后，发生在苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟成立以后，发生在苏联放弃了沙皇的帝国主义政策并以承认其他国家的民族自由与独立的原则作为它与它们的关系的基础以后。这种新的形势不能不鼓舞那些几世纪以来必须为他们的民族自由与独立而斗争的人民。
    抱着陈旧看法的人是不能理解在亚洲国家中发生的历史性的变化的。譬如说有时候他们从一个完全错误的角度来看这些发展。他们经常在注意着“共产主义阴谋”与“克里姆林的代理人”等等。这些人把一切被压迫人民争取自由与民族独立的运动都归因于共产主义，这样他们就反而违反了他们自己的意志，而提高了共产党人的威信——甚至是在与共产党人毫无关系的问题上。他们没有考虑到：具有不同政治见解与信仰的人民的争取民族自由与独立的自我牺牲的斗争，实际上是由他们要求自外国统治下解放、自殖民桎梏下解放的宿愿来促进的。至于谈到苏联人民的见解与信念，那么我们也并不隐讳我们对于各国人民——包括亚洲人民在内——的民族解放运动的同情与热烈感情。
    亚洲的根本政治变化的最高表现首先是在五亿多人口的中国。现在中华人民共和国已经建立起来，在那里已经奠定了人民民主制度的坚固基础。无视这个事实是荒谬的。中国的社会、经济与政治变化是每一个人都看见的，不考虑到这一点就是无视具有最大历史重要性的事件。
    此外，又有谁能否认像印度这样的人口在三亿以上的国家已经进入了历史舞台呢？就在最近印度还是一个殖民地，不过现在没有人能够否认：在保卫民族独立并力求在国际事务中占居重要地位的国家中，印度的地位越来越显著了。像印度尼西亚、缅甸等这些国家的重要性正在不断增加。
    这并不是说在这些国家中建立真正的独立是一件顺利的工作，在和某些国家的关系上就没有斗争或困难。不过所有这一切都证明了一个事实：亚洲确实已经发生了巨大的、具有历史意义的变化。这是在考虑目前和亚洲国家有关的任何问题时必须考虑到的事实。
    必须谈一谈在国际事务上占着特殊地位的中国的问题。
    苏联和中华人民共和国已经建立了巩固的友好关系，我这样说并不算是透露什么秘密。许多别的国家也已和中华人民共和国建立了政治和经济的关系。大家知道，像英国这样的国家，都非常重视发展和中华人民共和国的关系。大家也知道，还有许多别的国家没有和中华人民共和国建立正常的关系，唯一的原因就是外力阻挠它们这样做。
    至于美利坚合众国，该国政府是对中华人民共和国公开采取侵略政策的。美国的这种侵略政策同时正在影响今天亚洲的整个形势。
    中华人民共和国并没有对美利坚合众国采取侵略行动，这是人人都知道的。但是说到美国对中华人民共和国的政策时，情形就完全不同。
    自从中国人民从自己的领土上赶走了不关心中国人民的需要的外国资本的奴仆——破产了的蒋介石集团，并成立中华人民共和国那天起，中华人民共和国遭到一次又一次的侵略行动。在这方面，美国统治集团应当负主要责任。
    他们占领了台湾，扶助蒋介石集团的残余分子作为台湾的主人。他们用尽一切不可容许的手段来阻止中华人民共和国在联合国组织内取得它的合法地位。除此之外，他们还强迫联合国通过了一项关于禁运的决定，禁止和中国进行贸易。他们正在策划重建日本的军队，因而造成了对中国的威胁。他们谴责中国在朝鲜进行侵略，虽然，只是由于对为争取民族自由而斗争的朝鲜人民的十分自然的友谊感情，尤其是由于外国侵略军队逼近中国国境，为了中国安全的利益，中国人民志愿军才参加战争，援助朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。美国统治集团正在公开策划侵略中华人民共和国，经常保持从台湾和朝鲜半岛进攻中国边境的威胁，不断地在太平洋各岛上、在巴基斯坦等靠近中国边境的地区建立新的军事基地，可是美国统治集团却要说中国是侵略者，而美国不是。
    近来，在保护印度支那几个傀儡政权的借口下，制订了一个建立东南亚军事集团的计划，尽管没有一个自重的亚洲国家准备参加这一军事集团。这一计划又一次暴露了殖民国家企图利用一些亚洲国家去反对另一些亚洲国家的阴谋。
    亚洲的一些国家，首先是中国，正沿着我们这个进步和民主发展的时代所特有的新民主主义的道路开始了民族的和社会的新生，但是在这样一种具有极其重大意义的事件发生的时候，美国某些集团却死抓住旧的东西，企图保持殖民制度和半殖民地制度。
    然而，那些仍然以保持亚洲的反动集团和殖民制度为己任的国家，决不能因为不愿正视亚洲人民的发展中的历史性的变化而继续它们的老政策。美国对中华人民共和国所采取的敌视政策对于解决亚洲当前的问题是极其有害的。这种侵略政策是没有任何前途的，因为它违反亚洲和其他一切地方的整个历史发展过程，这种政策是目前阻碍根据各国人民的自由和民族权利的原则来解决亚洲当前问题的主要障碍。
    美国国务卿近来所发表的关于亚洲局势的演说表明，某些集团是如何顽固地打算保存已经死去了的东西，继续奉行陈腐了的帝国主义殖民政策。
    美国报纸于四月十六日发表了国务卿杜勒斯的声明。杜勒斯在声明中把中国人民按照其自由意志所促成的中华人民共和国的成立，说成是“巨大灾害”，造成“中国大陆的沦丧”。声明又说：“假使再丧失东南亚和太平洋诸岛的千千万万人民巨大的经济富源及战略地位，这种灾祸就会更加严重。”
    这位美国政治家的这个声明根本没有谈到中国、东南亚与太平洋诸岛人民的利益与权利。但是这个声明清楚地表明，他们怎样在千方百计地想要阻止伟大的中国人民和其它亚洲国家的人民从过去的殖民地与半殖民地的生活进入新的自由生活，进入民主制度。声明把在中国发生的根本改变说成“沦丧”，虽然中国从来没有属于谁，并且也从来没有打算要想属于任何外国。很明显，所谓“中国大陆的沦丧”的论调表明，他们想死死抱住过时的帝国主义殖民政策，这种论调是与承认各国人民自由与民族权利的原则毫无共同之处的。然而美国代表竟然还在这里就共产主义和自由原则大肆发表肤浅的议论。
    日内瓦会议为全面地研究这些亚洲问题——被公认为目前最迫切的问题——提供了可能性。
    在这里，我们有机会听取各种意见，并且在交换意见之后，能为这里所提出来的问题找到既符合有关各国人民的利益、又符合进步和巩固和平的利益的解决方法。例如，对朝鲜问题采取这样的方法，可以在许多方面有助于以和平方式来解决建立一个统一、独立的民主朝鲜的问题，并且可以达到真正和平解决朝鲜问题的目的。
    如果日内瓦会议本着亚洲人民完全有权利来自己解决自己的事情而且这首先是他们自己的事情的原则，那么会议将能达到这目的。
    其他国家，包括参加日内瓦会议的国家在内，有责任在这一方面以他们友好的努力来帮助亚洲人民。
    这样来了解目前会议的任务，才是最符合亚洲人民的自由和民族运动的利益，同时也符合巩固亚洲和平和世界和平的利益。日内瓦会议如能获得肯定的结果，也将有助于解决其他不单单和亚洲有关的问题。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来，在这里讲到希望亚洲各国齐心协力以实现亚洲的和平。
    苏联代表团完全同意这种意见。无论是欧洲国家或亚洲国家都应同样地采取有利于巩固欧洲、亚洲和全世界和平的步骤。
    会议听取了南朝鲜代表的发言，但是他在拙劣的发言里并没有提出积极而具体的建议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于和平解决朝鲜问题的意见，也在这里提了出来。
    苏联代表团认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日提出的建议，可以作为对于朝鲜问题采取适当决定的一种基础。
    这些建议符合朝鲜人民关于恢复他们国家统一的民族愿望，并符合巩固国际和平的利益。
