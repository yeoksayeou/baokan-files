The peaceful liberation of Tibet is a brilliant victory for the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and the beginning of a new era in Tibetan history. For the past three years, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel of the Central People's Government have strictly abided by the policy of ethnic equality and unity in the Common Program, faithfully implemented the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," and helped the Tibetan people develop their economy, politics, culture, and health, winning the support and love of the Tibetan compatriots. The Tibetan compatriots, in the warm family of the motherland, have forever been freed from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, and are united with the other ethnic groups of the motherland, advancing towards the road of peace and happiness.
