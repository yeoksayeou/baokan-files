Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 6th: The Kunming Wire Factory's rolling workshop successfully trial-produced automatic groove conversion. With automatic groove conversion, red-hot copper bars are sent to the fine rolling machine and will automatically be rolled into copper wires about the thickness of a thumb through six grooves. Now, in addition to the first six rolling grooves, automatic groove conversion has also been successfully tested for the last seven grooves of the rough rolling machine. This automatic groove conversion is basically the same as the "forward collar" and "reverse collar" of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill. After using this automatic groove conversion, rolling workers are no longer threatened by injury and disability, and production efficiency and product quality have been greatly improved. In the past, it took eighty seconds for a fine rolling machine to roll a copper bar, but now it only takes forty seconds, and the rejection rate has also been reduced from the original three percent to one percent. And the number of workers operating the machine has been reduced by five compared to the past.
	The rolling workshop is the first process in wire production. Its production process is roughly the same as that of a small rolling mill. Copper ingots are transported to this workshop, heated, and then rolled back and forth on rough rolling machines and fine rolling machines, eventually becoming copper wires about the thickness of a little finger. In the past, the rough rolling machines and fine rolling machines in the rolling workshop of the Kunming Wire Factory were all operated manually. This kind of operation was very tense, and if you were slightly careless, the red-hot copper wire would jump onto the worker’s body.
	At the beginning of 1953, when the Kunming Wire Factory launched production reforms, veteran workers Cao Chunshan, Xu Yongchang, Dong Xiang and others first tested automatic groove conversion on the fine rolling machine, which had the most accidents. The first groove conversion (ie, forward collar) was quickly successful, but many technical difficulties were encountered in testing the second groove conversion (ie, reverse collar). The copper wire coming out of the first groove conversion was flat, and it had to stand on its side to enter the second groove. The copper wire was soft and thin, making it extremely difficult to turn around. Cao Chunshan and others repeatedly studied the problem and made groove conversion models, but failed after six consecutive tests. The news that Zhang Mingshan, a worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's small rolling mill, had successfully created a "reverse collar" greatly encouraged the workers in the rolling workshop of the Kunming Wire Factory. Based on the experience of the small rolling mill, the leaders of the Kunming Wire Factory immediately organized party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League cadres, workshop technicians, and veteran skilled workers to form an automation team to specifically lead and study the groove conversion experiment. With the automation team, a series of technical problems such as the length of the groove conversion and the size of the splint were gradually resolved. In mid-July, the second automatic groove conversion was successfully tested.
	On the basis of the successful improvement of the fine rolling machine, the rolling workshop staff started to study and improve the rough rolling machine equipment in August last year. There are thirteen rolling grooves on the rough rolling machine. In mid-March of this year, the last seven groove conversions were also successfully tested. Currently, the workshop staff are designing the renovation of the first six rolling groove equipment of the rough rolling machine, striving to transform the entire production process of the workshop into mechanical operation.

    辗压电线工序的自动转槽试制成功
    昆明电线厂工人免除伤残的威胁，生产效率大为提高
    【新华社昆明六日电】昆明电线厂辗压车间试制自动转槽成功。有了自动转槽，火红的铜条送到精辗机，就会自动地经过六道转槽被辗成小姆指粗细的铜线。现在，粗辗机除前六道辗槽外，后七道的自动转槽也已试验成功。这种自动转槽基本上和鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂的“正围盘”和“反围盘”相同。运用这种自动转槽后，辗压工人不再受伤残的威胁，并且使生产效率和产品质量大为提高。过去精辗机辗压一条铜条要八十秒钟，现在只要四十秒钟，废品也由原来的百分之三降低到百分之一。而操作的工人却比过去节省了五个。
    辗压车间是电线生产上第一道工序的车间。它的生产过程和小型轧钢车间大体相同。铜锭运到这个车间经过加热后，在粗辗机和精辗机往返辗压，最后变成小指粗细的铜线。过去，昆明电线厂辗压车间的粗辗机和精辗机都是用人工操作的。这种操作非常紧张，稍一疏忽，火红的铜线就会窜到工人的身上。
    一九五三年初，昆明电线厂展开生产改革时，车间老工人曹春山、徐永昌、董祥等首先在事故最多的精辗机上试验自动转槽。第一道转槽（即正围盘）很快就成功了，但试验第二道转槽（即反围盘）却遇到很多技术上的困难。第一道转槽出来的铜线是平的，进第二道辗槽必须侧立起来，铜线又软又细，转身极为困难。曹春山等反复研究，并且做了转槽模型，一连试验了六次都没有成功。鞍钢小型轧钢厂工人张明山创造“反围盘”成功的事迹传到昆明电线厂，给辗压车间工人带来了极大鼓舞。根据小型轧钢厂的经验，昆明电线厂领导上立即组织党、政、工、团干部，车间技术人员和老技术工人，成立了自动化小组，专门领导和研究转槽的试验工作。有了自动化小组后，转槽的长短、夹板的大小等一系列的技术问题，终于逐渐获得了解决。七月中旬，第二道自动转槽就试验成功了。
    在精辗机改进成功的基础上，辗压车间职工从去年八月起又着手研究改进粗辗机设备。粗辗机上共有辗槽十三道。今年三月中旬，后七道转槽也已试验成功。目前，车间职工正在设计粗辗机前六道辗槽设备的改造，争取把车间全部生产过程改造为机械操作。
