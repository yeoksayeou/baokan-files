The Loveliest People in Korea

For Pyongyang's Tomorrow

On Moranbong Hill, along the Taedong River, and throughout the entire city of Pyongyang, are construction crowds and flying banners. Within this labor army rebuilding Pyongyang, are the engineering corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They come from the front lines of Kimhwa and the banks of the Imjin River, driving cranes, bulldozers, and carrying other tools and equipment, devoting themselves to intense labor for the happier tomorrow of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's temporary capital. Listen! The slogan "Leave Honor on the Taedong River" still echoes on the Taedong River Bridge, and the brickyard resonates with the song: "In battle, we go to the battlefield shoulder to shoulder, in construction, we sweat together." In the days after the armistice, they helped the Korean people build a pontoon bridge over the Taedong River, completed six repair projects including the Cabinet Building, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Trade, built and restored seven brick and tile kilns, and built eighty-two houses for the citizens.

The soldiers building the Taedong River pontoon bridge worked continuously for twelve days on a crash assignment, aiming to complete the project twenty days ahead of schedule. At this time, a very important part of the pile driver broke, and there was no time to buy a replacement from China. Li Zhenpeng, a soldier of a certain company, pondered and researched for a day and a night, finally manufacturing the part and ensuring the smooth progress of the project. At the construction sites of the Daesong and Gangnam brick factories, new records are constantly being set. Fu Yonglu exceeded his brick-carrying quota by more than double every day, Chen Taidian completed the tasks of four people alone, and every soldier exceeded their daily quota by 120% to 150%. When constructing the No. 4 firing kiln at the Gangnam brick factory, a flood submerged the kiln, and they worked with the Korean people to remove the floodwater, ensuring the task was completed on schedule. The soldiers building the workers' dormitories and civilian houses proposed "racing against the cold winter" to complete the project forty days ahead of schedule, so that workers and citizens could move out of the air-raid shelters sooner.

Now, these engineering soldiers are working with the Korean people to build the large-scale Central Ministries Comprehensive Office Building, the Taedong River Railway Bridge, the automobile repair factory, the Central Equipment Warehouse, and the School for Revolutionary Martyrs' Children, Kim Chaek University of Technology, the Affiliated Hospital of the Medical University, the Educational Book Printing Factory, the Central Broadcasting Station... On these construction sites, labor competitions are underway, the names of new record creators constantly appear on the blackboard newspapers, and news of exceeding quotas is broadcast again and again through the waves of the Korean Central Broadcasting Station.

Their slogan is also their ideal and expectation: "Let Pyongyang be more beautiful tomorrow than before the war!" (Li Qinglian)

Heroically Seizing "Culture Mountain"

After Comrade Zhao Hengzhi returned from participating in the general election, his cultural studies had fallen behind quite a bit. But he was not discouraged at all, and used every available moment on his schedule to catch up on his cultural studies. He also asked the correspondent Tang Fusheng to help him with tutoring, and finally caught up with the lessons he had missed.

Comrade Zhao Hengzhi is the company commander of the 11th Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. In the battle to smash the enemy's "Autumn Offensive," he led a platoon of soldiers, repelling eight frantic attacks by the enemy's entire battalion and entire company, annihilating more than 300 enemies. The entire platoon was awarded a collective merit once, and he himself was awarded a first-class merit and the glorious title of "Second-Class Combat Hero." When the 11th Company began cultural studies, he was the first to say: "Studying culture is one of the prerequisites for regularizing the troops and mastering modern weapons... In order to defend the motherland and defend peace, we must strive to improve our cultural level!"

In his studies, he is a model of discipline, saluting the teachers when class begins and ends, and asking the teachers for leave when he cannot attend class due to official business. He can complete 100% of the assignments given to him by the teachers. He once said to the teacher: "In administration, I am the company commander, but in cultural studies, you are my teacher, and I should listen to your leadership!" One of his important learning methods is to closely integrate learning with work and life. When the higher authorities assign tasks or report work to the higher authorities, he tries his best to use the words he has learned to write simple notes or outlines. When the soldiers are playing ball or dancing, he tries his best to record the details. In February of this year, he went to participate in the anniversary celebration of the founding of the Korean People's Army. On the way back, he used the newly learned words "envy" to make a sentence: "I envy the heroes of the People's Army!"

In this way, Comrade Zhao Hengzhi achieved a grade of A in his cultural studies, and is now able to initially read general newspapers and magazines and take simple notes. However, he does not have the slightest complacency, and continues to diligently study culture while vigilantly guarding the position, striving tirelessly for the modernization of the troops and the socialist construction of the motherland. (He Zhibu, Wu Dongjiang)

Here Will Be a Forest Again

On April 3rd, eighty tree-planting "shock troops" composed of soldiers from the 10th Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army set off. They carried the pickaxes and shovels that had been used to dig tunnels and trenches, drove rubber-wheeled carts loaded with various seedlings, and came to the designated tree-planting area with the joy of loving labor and cheerfully shouting at the livestock.

Here, there used to be a towering, dense pine forest that almost blocked half the sky. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the enemy, like destroying Korean cities and villages, used napalm bombs, cannons, and bombs to cruelly destroy and burn those pine trees that had lived for decades or even hundreds of years. Now, on the bare hillside, all that remains are charred tree stumps. Around many bomb craters, rusty shells and shrapnel can still be found everywhere.

The 10th Company is a meritorious company. Guo Zhengxi, who won the honorary title of "Special-Class Meritorious Person" in the counterattack south of Kimhwa last summer, is in this company. The soldiers of this company have always regarded helping Korea with construction as a glorious task. Everyone is eager to participate in helping the Korean people build houses and plant spring crops. Today, they are turning the soil and planting seedlings on this war-torn land, and put forward the slogan "Plant quickly, plant well, guarantee planting, guarantee survival, and guarantee it will not be harmed by war again."

On this day, the Forestry Department of the Koksan County People's Committee also sent several technical cadres to provide on-site guidance. They were moved and praised repeatedly when they saw the Volunteer Army soldiers planting trees in a tense and happy atmosphere. Li Zhengwen, a director of the Forestry Department, took the hand of Tang Zhengcai, a first-class meritorious person, and said gratefully: "You not only use your blood to help us defeat the enemy, but also use your labor to help us build the country. The Korean people will always remember you." Tang Zhengcai said modestly: "Helping the Korean people with construction is a task assigned to us by the people of the motherland."

Just as the sun was setting in the west, all 11,322 seedlings were planted. The soldiers wiped the sweat from their faces, stretched their sore backs, and looked at this area, which tomorrow will be a towering and dense pine forest again, and smiles of victory appeared on everyone's face.

    最可爱的人在朝鲜
    为了平壤的明天
    在牡丹峰上，在大同江岸，在整个平壤市区，到处是建设的人群，到处是飞扬的旌旗。而在这支重建平壤的劳动大军中，还有中国人民志愿军的工兵部队。他们来自金城前线和临津江畔，他们开着起重机、推土机和带着其他工具器材，为了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的临时首都更幸福的明天投入了紧张的劳动。听吧！大同江桥上“把荣誉留在大同江”的口号声还在随波震荡，砖窑厂里就响起了
  “战斗里我们并肩上战场，建设中我们汗水一块淌”的歌声。在停战后的日子里，他们帮助朝鲜人民架起了大同江的便桥，完成了内阁大楼、外务省和贸易省大楼等六项修缮工程，新建和修复砖瓦烧成炉七座，还为市民们修建房屋八十二幢。
    架设大同江便桥的战士们连续进行了十二天的突击任务，他们要提前二十天竣工。就在这时植桩机坏了一个很重要的零件，回国去买已经来不及了。某连战士李震鹏就苦思钻研了一天一夜，终于制造出来，保证了工程的顺利进行。在大成、江南两窑业工厂的工地上，新纪录在不断出现。傅永禄搬砖每天都超过了定额的一倍，陈太典一个人完成了四个人的任务，每一个战士每天都超额完成了自己任务的百分之一百二十到百分之一百五十。砌江南窑业工厂第四号烧成炉时，洪水淹没了炉身，他们就和朝鲜人民一块排除了洪水，保证了任务按期完成。修建工人宿舍和民房的战士们，提出“要和寒冬赛跑”，争取提前四十天完工，好叫工人和市民早点搬出防空洞。
    现在，这些工兵战士们又和朝鲜人民一道，正在修建规模宏大的中央各省综合办公厅、大同江铁桥、汽车修理工厂、中央器材仓库，和革命烈士子女学校、金策工业大学、医科大学附属医院、教育图书印刷厂、中央广播电台……。在这些工地上，劳动竞赛正在展开，新纪录创造者的名字不断在黑板报上出现，超额完成任务的消息，也一次再次地随着朝鲜中央广播电台的电波传送出来。
    他们的口号也是他们的理想和期望：“让明天的平壤比战前更漂亮！”　　　（李清濂）
    英雄攻夺“文化山”
    赵恒志同志参加普选回来，文化课已经拉下来好多了。可是他一点也不灰心，把时间表上所排列的每一个可以支配的时间，都用来补习文化课。他还请通讯员唐福生帮助他补习，拉下来的课终于补上了。
    赵恒志同志是志愿军某部第十一连的连长，在粉碎敌人“秋季攻势”的战斗中，曾带领一个排的战士，击退了敌人整营整连的八次疯狂进攻，歼敌三百多名，全排立集体功一次，他自己也立了一等功，并荣获“二级战斗英雄”的光荣称号。十一连开始文化学习时，他就首先表示：“学习文化是使部队正规化、掌握现代化武器的先决条件之一。……为了保卫祖国、保卫和平，一定要努力提高文化水平！
    在学习中，他是遵守纪律的模范，上下课时向教员敬礼，因公不能上课时就向教员请假，教员交给他的作业，都能百分之百地完成。他曾对教员说：“在行政上我是连长，在文化学习中你就是我的老师，我应该听从你的领导！”他的重要学习方法之一，就是能紧密地结合工作，结合生活。上级布置工作或向上级汇报工作时，他都尽力用自己学过的字写成简单的笔记或提纲。战士们在打球、跳舞时，他也尽力来记录中间的情节。今年二月间，他去参加了朝鲜人民军建军节的纪念大会，在回来的路上，他就用新学来的词汇“羡慕”两个字练习造句：“我很羡慕人民军的英雄们！”
    就这样，赵恒志同志在文化学习中的成绩得到了甲等，现在已经能初步阅读一般的报纸和杂志，并能做简单的笔记了。可是，他却没有丝毫的自满情绪，仍在一边警惕地守卫着阵地，一边继续努力学习文化，为了部队的现代化，为了祖国的社会主义建设而不懈地奋斗着。　　　　（何智甫、吴东江）
    这里又将是一片树林
    四月三日，志愿军某部第十连战士组成的八十位栽树“突击手”出发了。他们扛起曾经打过坑道、挖过战壕的十字镐和铁锹，赶着满载各种树苗的胶轮大车，怀着热爱劳动的喜悦，愉快地吆喝着牲口，来到了被指定的栽树的地区。
    这里，从前是一片高耸茂密、几乎挡住半个天的松树林。朝鲜战争爆发后，敌人像毁灭朝鲜的城市和乡村一样，用凝固汽油弹、大炮和炸弹，把那些已经活了几十年甚至几百年的松树残忍地炸毁和烧毁了。现在，光秃秃的山头上，剩下来的只是一块块被烧焦了的树桩。在许多弹坑的周围，还可以随处找到生了锈的炮弹壳和弹片。
    十连是个功臣连。去年夏季金城以南反击战中，荣获“特等功臣”光荣称号的郭正喜就在这个连队。这一连的战士们从来就把帮助朝鲜建设看做光荣的任务。在帮助朝鲜人民修建房子和春耕播种中，大家都是争先恐后地参加。今天，他们又在这块被战火烧伤的土地上，翻起了新土，栽上了树苗，并且提出“种得快，种得好，包栽，包活，还包它再不受战争灾害”的口号。
    这天，谷山郡人民委员会山林科还特派了几位技术干部前来现场指导。他们看到志愿军战士们紧张愉快地栽树的情景，激动得连连称赞。山林科的一个所长李政文，拉着一等功臣唐正才的手感激地说：“你们不仅用鲜血来援助我们打败敌人，还用劳动来帮助我们建设国家，朝鲜人民要永远记住你们。”唐正才谦逊地说：“帮助朝鲜人民建设是祖国人民交给我们的任务。”
    太阳刚偏西，一万一千三百二十二棵树苗全栽起来了。战士们揩掉脸上的汗，伸展着弯得发酸的腰，望着这一片明天又将是高耸茂密的松树林，每人的脸上都露出胜利的微笑。　　　（许锦炎）（附图片）
