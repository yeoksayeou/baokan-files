TASS Report from Geneva, May 28th: The position of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, advocating a thorough and simultaneous ceasefire in Indochina as soon as possible, has been warmly approved by the broad public who hope for a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue. Many newspapers point out that the position of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has increased the hope of reaching an agreement.

At the same time, the comments of certain newspapers (the mouthpieces of those who are not interested in a smooth solution to the restoration of peace in Indochina) intend to distort the proposals of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. For example, these newspapers insist that the proposals of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam advocate the division of Indochina territory.

This statement is nothing but a deliberate distortion of the truth. As everyone knows, at this stage, the discussion is limited to the military issues included in the proposals made by the French delegation on May 8th and the proposals made by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 10th. During the discussion, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressed its opinions on issues such as simultaneously implementing a ceasefire throughout Indochina, determining the areas for the concentration of troops from both sides, and stopping the transport of new troops and weapons into Indochina.

As for the political aspects of the Indochina issue, everyone knows that they have not been discussed in the secret meetings so far. Everyone also knows that during the discussion, the delegations of France and several other countries tried to separate the Indochina ceasefire issue from the solution of at least some political issues. The proposals made by the French delegation on May 8th completely avoided talking about political issues. On the other hand, some of the proposals made by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam not only advocated a ceasefire but also sought a lasting and final solution to the entire Indochina issue based on the recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Indochinese people. These proposals advocated that France recognize the sovereignty and independence of Vietnam within its entire territory, as well as the sovereignty and independence of Cambodia and Laos, and hold free general elections in the three countries of Indochina in order to establish unified governments in each country, etc.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam already submitted proposals for the political settlement of Indochina to the conference for consideration on May 10th. Anyone can clearly see that these proposals have nothing in common with the method of dividing Indochina. Naturally, it is also hoped that the other party can put forward its opinions on political issues, and these issues should be discussed by the conference participants as soon as possible. If political issues can be discussed in addition to military issues, a comprehensive understanding of all issues can be achieved, which will help the success of the conference.

    塔斯社报道印度支那问题政治方面的情况
   【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社日内瓦二十八日讯：越南民主共和国代表团主张尽早在印度支那实现彻底的、同时的停火的立场，受到希望和平解决印度支那问题的广大公众的热烈赞同。许多报纸指出，越南民主共和国代表团的立场，已经增加了达成协议的希望。
    同时，某些报纸（那些对顺利解决恢复印度支那和平问题不感兴趣的分子的喉舌）的评论，却打算把越南民主共和国代表团的建议加以歪曲。例如，这些报纸硬说越南民主共和国代表团的建议是主张分割印度支那领土的。
    这种说法无非是故意歪曲事实的真相。大家知道，在目前阶段，讨论只限于法国代表团五月八日提出的建议以及越南民主共和国代表团五月十日提出的建议里所包括的军事问题。在讨论的过程中，越南民主共和国代表团曾经就在印度支那全境同时实现停火、确定交战双方部队集结的地区、停止把新的部队与武器运入印度支那等问题表明了自己的意见。
    至于印度支那问题的政治方面，大家知道，到目前为止还没有在秘密会议上讨论过。大家也都知道，在讨论过程中，法国和若干其他国家的代表团曾力图把印度支那停火问题和至少是若干政治问题的解决分开来讨论。法国代表团在五月八日提出的建议完全避免谈政治问题。另一方面，越南民主共和国代表团所提出的若干建议不仅主张实现停火，而且也主张在承认印度支那人民的合法的民族权利的基础上，谋求整个印度支那问题的持久和最后的解决。这些建议主张法国承认越南在其全部领土内的主权和独立，以及高棉与寮国的主权和独立，在印度支那三个国家内举行自由的普选，以便在每个国家内建立统一的政府等等。
    越南民主共和国代表团在五月十日已经提出关于印度支那的政治解决的建议供会议考虑，谁都可以明白地看出，这种建议和分割印度支那的办法毫无共同之处。自然，也希望对方能够提出它对于政治问题的意见，而且这些问题应该由会议参加者及早讨论。假若除了讨论军事问题以外再能讨论政治问题，就可以对一切问题有一个全面的了解，从而有助于会议工作的成功。
