    Shanghai Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce, etc.
    Organize Private Merchants to Go to the Countryside to Purchase Native and Special Products
    The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Administration of Industry and Commerce recently, in conjunction with relevant departments, organized a group of private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase native and special products, which has played a certain role in further enlivening the urban and rural economy.
    Currently, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce and other units, the industries actively going to the countryside to purchase local and special products include the Haibei Osmanthus, medicinal materials, vegetable and ground products, fruit and ground products, and coal, firewood, and charcoal industries. From mid-March to the end of March, the medicinal materials industry had 50 households sending people to the countryside or using telecommunications to entrust local private merchants to purchase medicinal materials, which increased to 66 households in April. More than 60,000 jin of medicinal materials have now been transported to Shanghai, including more than 100 varieties of fast-selling products such as Sichuan white peony, Magnolia officinalis, Amomum villosum, Chao Tuckahoe, and Ophiopogon japonicus; the purchasing areas cover various large, medium, and small cities, such as Wenzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang, Putian in Fujian, Bo County in Anhui, and Nanning in Guangxi. Since the Haibei Osmanthus industry organized a purchasing group to go to Zou County, Shandong, to purchase goods in late March, the number of households going to the countryside has gradually increased, and has now increased to 66 households, an increase of half compared to early March; the purchasing areas include 21 places such as Liuzhou, Nanzheng, Fuzhou, and Xinxiang; the purchasing varieties include more than 30 kinds such as red dates, lotus seeds, shiitake mushrooms, seaweed, and dried shrimp. The vegetable and ground products industry and cooperatives have organized joint purchasing groups to purchase bamboo shoots and mao bamboo shoots in Deqing, Hang County, Ningbo, and Cixi; from March 26 to April 14, more than 38,500 dan have arrived. Thirty private merchants in the fruit and ground products industry have also gone to the Hang County area to purchase cherries.
