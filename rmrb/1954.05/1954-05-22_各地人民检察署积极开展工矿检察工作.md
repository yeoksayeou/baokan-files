Local People's Procuratorates Actively Carry Out Industrial and Mining Procuratorial Work

With the beginning of the nation's planned economic construction, People's Procuratorates at all levels are focusing on carrying out procuratorial work in factories and mines.

In March of last year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate organized working groups to go to steel plants in Anshan, Beijing Shijingshan, Taiyuan, Chongqing, and other places to understand various situations and problems related to procuratorial work in industry and mining. People's Procuratorates in various industrial cities and People's Procuratorates above the provincial level have successively started industrial and mining procuratorial work by focusing on key experiments and procuratorial cases. In October of last year, the East China Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate held a specialized conference on industrial and mining procuratorial work to summarize and deploy industrial and mining procuratorial work. Up to now, 57 procuratorates across the country have carried out key experimental work and procuratorial case work in 46 major factories and mines. The key experimental targets are mainly the steel industry, machinery manufacturing industry, fuel industry, and national defense industry, as well as the textile industry and paper-making industry in light industry; most of them are state-owned or local state-owned, and some are jointly owned by public and private sectors.

People's Procuratorates in various industrial cities regard carrying out industrial and mining procuratorial work, ensuring the smooth progress of national industrial production and construction, and protecting the legitimate interests of workers as their basic tasks. They started with investigation and research, inspected some cases that harmed production and the interests of workers, and widely carried out legal discipline education and class education, which achieved good results. Recently, when the Anshan City People's Procuratorate inspected three different types of cases in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Technology Department, Transportation Department, and Civil Construction Engineering Company involving violations of laws and disciplines and violations of operating procedures that caused significant losses, it cooperated with the Anshan City People's Court to pilot a relatively complete public prosecution system, which was warmly welcomed by the factory and mine leadership and the masses of employees. These three cases are: (1) Zou Guangwei, a laboratory technician in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Technology Department Inspection Room, illegally altered the test results of dolomite (steelmaking raw material) in order to earn more piece-rate wages. The offender tested a total of 250 pieces of material and illegally altered 115 of them. Testing the components contained in dolomite is a crucial key to determining whether to mine it or not, and it is also an urgent task in the current national economic construction to develop resources. If mining is carried out based on incorrect test results, it will cause immeasurable losses to national economic construction. (2) Xu Shaogeng, the leader of the electrician group of the Plumbing and Electrical Team of the Civil Construction Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in order to attack Cao Hongkui, an activist he was jealous of, sneaked into the shed where the small transformer was located when no one was around and cut off the lighting wire leading to the boiler room of the construction site central area, causing 85 workers to be unable to work and delaying the progress of the project. (3) Sun Yongtai, the leader of the road maintenance team of the Qilingzi Work Zone of the Urban Works Section of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, knowing the technical processing regulations and technical safety regulations, insisted on his erroneous behavior, resulting in a serious derailment accident in which a locomotive carrying about 800 tons was disconnected and the water tank was separated from the body, causing a national loss of more than 55 million yuan. After investigation and verification by the Anshan City People's Procuratorate, the above three cases were prosecuted, and the Anshan City People's Court sentenced the criminals to imprisonment. Employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company reflected one after another: "It gave us a great warning," "We must abide by the operating procedures at all times in the future." In order to expand the effect, the Anshan City People's Procuratorate also seized the opportunities of winter training and other events in the basic construction system of Anshan Iron and Steel Company to focus on organizing employees to discuss the above-mentioned cases. After the handling of these cases, the Anshan City People's Procuratorate also assisted the inspected units in improving the system, which was welcomed by the leadership of the inspected units. The Civil Construction Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company felt that the procuratorate's handling of cases played a great role, and specially sent the director of the company's supervision office to send several illegal cases that had occurred in the past to the procuratorate, requesting them to go to inspect and deal with them. Another example is the case of Li Bingjun, the squad leader of the first team of the Xinzhuangzi Coal Mine of the Huainan Mining Bureau, who knowingly violated the rules and caused an accident in which three people were injured by blasting. After the prosecution was filed and the Huainan City People's Court sentenced him, the effect was also very good. Blaster Zhang Yunjiu said, "People like Li Bingjun who knowingly violate the rules and joke about the lives of workers should be brought to justice." After the mine leaders let the students of the blaster training class study the materials of the case, no similar incidents have occurred so far.

In the key experiments in industry and mining, many industrial cities' People's Procuratorates have been able to assist the factory and mine leadership in completing production tasks, solving key problems hindering production, and closely relying on the Party and government leadership and closely contacting relevant departments, so their work has been rapidly developed. The working group dispatched by the Chongqing City People's Procuratorate to Factory 101 was in the midst of the factory's rectification of labor discipline when they arrived. They concentrated their efforts and determined to focus on the second, third, and fifth workshops to carry out their work. Based on the specific situation and problems of the rectification of labor discipline, they put forward rationalization proposals to the factory's Party committee. Coupled with the coordination of other work in the factory, the phenomenon of lateness and early departure in the factory was greatly reduced, and the absenteeism rate was significantly reduced. Zhang Yishu, deputy secretary of the Party committee of Factory 101, said at a study meeting for the Party branch secretaries of the factory's workshops: "The comrades sent by the higher authorities to help us in our work are to prevent our factory cadres from making mistakes or making fewer mistakes." He also made specific arrangements for how each workshop should assist the working group in understanding the situation. The Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine Working Group, jointly organized by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and other units, learned about the situation from participating in the research and summary of personal injury and death accidents, and put forward rationalization proposals, which promoted the safe production work of the mine, and was also very popular with the Party, government leaders, and employees of the mine. Zhao Weiping, deputy secretary of the Party committee of Kailuan Coal Mine, said: "After the working group came, it helped us improve our work." When the working group dispatched by the Changchun City People's Procuratorate first arrived at the mechanized supply station of a factory, individual leading comrades thought that they were just here to "find fault," so they said to them: "The more people you send, the better, but don't criticize some welfare issues in front of the workers as soon as you see them, which will not only fail to solve our problems but will also add trouble." In response to this thinking, the working group comprehensively explained to the station's leadership what to inspect and how to inspect, and frequently reported the situation to them in their work; finally, they eliminated their concerns. The station leaders took the initiative to convene subordinate units, held symposiums, actively introduced the situation, and also sent four cadres to assist in the work. After the case of Liang Yufen, a grafter in the station, was dealt with, a person in charge of the station said: "Don't leave, help us do it; if you weren't here, we don't know how much trouble it would have taken us!" In order to cooperate with the factory's overall construction tasks in 1954, the Changchun City People's Procuratorate working group will further cooperate closely with relevant departments under the support and leadership of the Party and government leadership of the factory, starting from ensuring the safety and quality of construction and the annual material reserve and supply, to further carry out procuratorial work.

Over the past year, People's Procuratorates in various industrial cities have achieved preliminary results and experience in carrying out industrial and mining procuratorial work in a planned way, and have cultivated some cadres who are familiar with industrial and mining work in the work process. Some regions have also established procuratorial organs in industrial and mining areas. This is the foundation for further carrying out industrial and mining procuratorial work in the future. The Second National Procuratorial Work Conference recently held in Beijing, in addition to exchanging the experiences of industrial and mining procuratorial work across the country, specially studied the tasks and working methods of procuratorial work in ensuring national industrial production and construction, and also studied how to use various procuratorial work systems—the investigation and investigation supervision system, the trial supervision system, and the general supervision system—to serve industrial and mining production and construction.

    各地人民检察署积极开展工矿检察工作
    随着国家有计划的经济建设的开始，各级人民检察署正在重点开展工厂、矿山中的检察工作。
    最高人民检察署于去年三月，曾经连续组织工作组分别到鞍山、北京石景山、太原、重庆等地钢铁厂，了解工矿中有关检察业务的各种情况和问题。各工业城市人民检察署和省级以上人民检察署则先后从重点试验和检察案件入手，开展了工矿检察工作。去年十月，最高人民检察署华东分署曾经召开工矿检察工作专业会议，总结和布置工矿检察工作。到目前止，全国已经有五十七个检察署在四十六个主要工厂和矿山中开展了重点试验工作和检察案件工作。重点试验对象主要是钢铁工业、机器制造工业、燃料工业和国防工业，也有轻工业中的纺织工业和造纸工业等；其中大部分是国营或地方国营，部分是公私合营。
    各工业城市人民检察署都把开展工矿检察工作，保证国家工业生产建设的顺利进行和保护工人的合法利益作为基本任务。他们从调查研究入手，检察了一些危害生产和工人利益的案件，并广泛进行了法纪教育和阶级教育，收到良好效果。鞍山市人民检察署最近在检察鞍山钢铁公司技术处、运输部、土木建筑工程公司中违法乱纪、违反操作规程造成重大损失的三个不同类型的案件时，配合鞍山市人民法院，试行了比较完全的公诉制度，受到厂矿领导方面和职工群众的热烈欢迎。这三个案件是：（一）鞍山钢铁公司技术处检验室化验员邹广维，为了多拿计件工资，竟非法涂改白云石（炼钢原料）化验结果。该犯共化验二百五十件材料，即非法涂改一百十五件。对白云石所含成分进行化验是决定开采与否的重要关键，也是当前国家经济建设中开发资源的紧急任务，如根据不正确的化验结果进行开采，将会给国家经济建设造成无法估量的损失。（二）鞍山钢铁公司土木建筑工程公司水暖电气队电工组组长徐绍庚，为了打击他所嫉妒的积极分子曹洪魁，竟乘人不备，潜入小型变压器所在地的席屋里，把通往工地中心区施工处锅炉房的照明灯线切断，使得八十五个工人不能进行工作，拖延了工程进度。（三）鞍山钢铁公司运输部环市工务段七岭子工区养路小组组长孙永泰，明明知道技术处理规程和技术保安规程，却坚持自己的错误行为，造成一辆载重约八百吨的机车脱节、水柜与机体分离的严重颠覆事故，使国家损失五千五百多万元。以上三案由鞍山市人民检察署调查及鉴定证实，提起公诉后，鞍山市人民法院对犯罪者判处了徒刑。鞍山钢铁公司职工纷纷反映：“给我们好大的警惕”，“我们今后必须时时刻刻遵守操作规程”。鞍山市人民检察署为了扩大效果，又抓住鞍山钢铁公司基本建设系统冬训等机会，重点组织职工对上述案件进行讨论。这些案件处理后，鞍山市人民检察署还协助被检察单位改进了制度，受到被检察单位领导方面的欢迎。鞍山钢铁公司土木建筑工程公司觉得检察署办案作用很大，特派该公司监察室主任把他们过去所发生的几件违法案件送给检察署，要求前往检查处理。又如淮南市人民检察署检察了淮南矿务局新庄孜煤矿第一队小班长李炳俊明知故犯、放炮炸伤三人事故案，经提起公诉，由淮南市人民法院判处后，效果也很好。放炮员张运九说：“像李炳俊这样明知故犯，拿工人生命开玩笑，应该法办。”该矿领导上把该案材料让放炮员训练班学员学习后，到现在再没有发生过类似事件。
    许多工业城市人民检察署在工矿进行重点试验中，由于能协助厂矿领导方面完成生产任务，解决阻碍生产的关键问题，并紧紧依靠党政领导方面，密切联系有关部门，工作因而得到迅速开展。重庆市人民检察署派到一○一厂的工作组，下厂后正值全厂整顿劳动纪律，他们便集中力量，确定以二场、三场、五场为重点，开展工作，根据整顿劳动纪律的具体情况和问题，向该厂党委提出合理化建议，加上该厂其它工作的配合，使该厂迟到早退现象大大减少，缺勤率显著下降。一○一厂党委副书记张逸舒在全厂车间党支部书记学习会上说：“上级派来的同志帮助我们工作，就是要使我们厂内干部不犯错误或少犯错误。”他并对各车间如何协助工作组了解情况，作了具体布置。最高人民检察署等单位联合组织的唐山开滦煤矿工作组，从参加人身伤亡事故的研究、总结等工作中了解情况，提出合理化建议，推动了该矿的安全生产工作，也很受该矿党、政领导方面和职工群众的欢迎。开滦煤矿党委副书记赵维屏说：“工作组来后，帮助我们提高了工作。”长春市人民检察署派到一个工厂的工作组，初到该厂机械化供应站时，个别领导同志以为他们只是来“找岔子”的，就对他们说：“你们来的人愈多愈好，可是不要一看到一些福利方面的问题，就在工人面前乱批评，结果不但没给我们解决问题，反添了麻烦。”工作组针对这种思想，把检察什么、如何检察，向该站领导上作了全面交代，并在工作中经常向他们汇报情况；终于使他们消除了顾虑。供应站领导方面主动召集所属单位，举行座谈会，积极介绍情况，还派了四个干部协助工作。当处理了该站贪污分子梁毓棻案后，该站的一个负责人说：“你们别走了，帮助我们搞吧；要不是你们在这里，我们不知要费多少事呢！”为了配合该厂一九五四年的全面施工任务，长春市人民检察署工作组将进一步在该厂党、政领导方面的支持和领导下，与有关部门密切合作，从保障施工的安全、质量及年度材料储备与供应方面着手，进一步开展检察工作。
    一年来，各地工业城市人民检察署有计划地开展工矿检察工作已取得初步成绩和经验，并在工作过程中培养了一些熟悉工矿工作的干部。有些地区还建立了工矿区的检察机构。这是今后进一步开展工矿检察工作的基础。最近在北京举行的第二届全国检察工作会议，除交流了全国各地工矿检察工作的经验以外，特别研究了检察工作在保证国家工业生产建设中的任务和工作方法，还研究了如何运用各项检察工作制度——侦讯和侦讯监督制度、审判监督制度和一般监督制度为工矿生产建设服务。
