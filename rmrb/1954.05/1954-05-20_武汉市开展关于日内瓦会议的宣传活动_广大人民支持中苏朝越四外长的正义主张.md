    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: The people of Wuhan have expressed their support for the just stand of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and the representatives of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam at the Geneva Conference regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, through their practical actions.
    Since April 26th, thousands of reporters and propagandists in Wuhan have been extensively carrying out propaganda activities regarding the Geneva Conference in factories, enterprises, military units, government offices, organizations, and schools. Many factories used loudspeakers, blackboards, and big-character posters to regularly and promptly publicize the great significance of the Geneva Conference to the workers. Reading groups in many factories and neighborhood residents insisted on studying current affairs every day. Employees of the Wuhan Post Office even stipulated that they would set aside one evening each week for current affairs study. Some factory workers also held forums and discussions on the Geneva Conference. People have expressed their willingness to use practical actions to continue to work hard for the defense of world peace. At the symposium of advanced production workers of the jointly-owned Hankou No. 1 Textile Company, the workers warmly supported the successive speeches of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il, and Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong. Jin Fumei, a worker from the Zhu Zaodi team, said: We must fulfill and overfulfill the national production plan, spin good yarn, weave good cloth, support the construction of heavy industry, consolidate national defense, and increase the strength to defend world peace. Workers in the engine workshop of the Hubei Farm Implement Factory proposed to complete the May production plan to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference.
    Recently, Wuhan's propaganda activities regarding the Geneva Conference have continued to deepen. In order to strengthen the leadership of this propaganda activity, Li Zhi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently gave a report on the Geneva Conference to 3,500 reporters and propagandists. Now, many factories, enterprises, government offices, organizations, schools, and neighborhoods are conveying and studying this report.

    武汉市数以千计的报告员、宣传员，从四月二十六日起，就在工厂、企业、部队、机关、团体、学校中广泛开展了关于日内瓦会议的宣传活动。许多工厂用广播器、黑板报、大字报经常地及时地向职工群众宣传日内瓦会议的重大意义。许多工厂的工人和街道居民的读报组，每天都坚持时事学习。武汉市邮局的职工并规定每星期抽出一个晚上进行时事学习。有的工厂职工还就日内瓦会议问题举行了座谈会和讨论会。人们都表示要用实际行动，继续为保卫世界和平而努力生产和工作。在公私合营汉口第一纺织公司先进生产工作者的座谈会上，工人们热烈拥护和支持周恩来外长、莫洛托夫外长、南日外务相和范文同副总理兼代外长的历次发言。朱早弟小组的工人金福梅说：我们必须完成和超额完成国家生产计划，纺好纱，织好布，支援重工业建设，巩固国防，增加保卫世界和平的力量。湖北省农具厂引擎车间工人提出完成五月份生产计划，来支持周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。
    最近，武汉市关于日内瓦会议的宣传活动仍在继续深入展开。为了加强对这一宣传活动的领导，中共武汉市委员会宣传部副部长黎智日前曾先后向三千五百名报告员、宣传员作了关于日内瓦会议的报告。现在，许多工厂、企业、机关、团体、学校、街道正对这一报告进行传达和学习。
