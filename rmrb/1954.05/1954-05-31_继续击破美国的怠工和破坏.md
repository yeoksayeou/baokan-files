    Continue to Thwart American Sabotage and Delaying Tactics
    By Our Correspondents Wu Wentao and Du Bo
    At the eighth secret meeting on the Indochina issue held on May 29th, the Geneva Conference unanimously adopted the British proposal to achieve a rapid simultaneous ceasefire in Indochina.
    As the conference communique stated, the proposal stipulates that in order to achieve a simultaneous ceasefire in Indochina as soon as possible, the commanders of the warring parties in Indochina should immediately send representatives to Geneva for direct consultations and initiate contact on the ground to study the deployment of both sides' forces after the cessation of hostilities, first studying the issue of troop regrouping areas in Vietnam, and submit reports and recommendations to the Geneva Conference as soon as possible. This is the first resolution passed by the Geneva Conference since it began discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina. Undoubtedly, this is an important step forward in the discussion of restoring peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference.
    Of particular significance is that this resolution was adopted unanimously, and no delegation at the meeting opposed the proposal, although some delegations reserved some opinions.
    In order to seek an early simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina, the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union have made unremitting efforts at the Geneva Conference. When the Indochina issue entered secret discussions on May 17th, the first problem encountered was that the United States and France insisted on discussing only a military ceasefire and not a political settlement. It was only through the efforts of Molotov and other foreign ministers concerned about peace in Indochina that the conference reached an agreement on the procedural issues of discussion. That is, the proposals of Pham Van Dong and Bidault, as well as Molotov's supplementary proposal, were taken as the basis for discussion, with both military and political issues discussed, with military issues taking priority. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Molotov put forward five questions at the meeting on May 21st, summarizing the military aspects of the proposals already put forward at the conference as the basis for discussing the military part of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. This enabled the conference to enter into the substantive discussion of the military ceasefire issue.
    At the sixth secret meeting on May 25th, Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong made an important speech, putting forward a concrete implementation plan for a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina, which further advanced the conference. At the seventh secret meeting on May 27th, China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, based on the results of discussions at previous meetings, proposed a six-point basic principle for the cessation of hostilities in Indochina. This proposal included the common points existing in the views of all parties as a basis for reaching certain agreements so that the conference could further negotiate the remaining differences. The British proposal adopted at the eighth secret meeting basically conforms to the first two points of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's May 27th proposal, and the general spirit of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal is to seek an early simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina and achieve peace.
    These efforts by the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Chinese delegation have powerfully promoted the progress of the conference, demonstrated the sincere will of the peoples of the three countries to seek peace, and have gained a good response from the people and public opinion of all countries. When Foreign Minister Molotov put forward the five questions that enabled the conference to enter the substantive discussion of the military part, public opinion generally believed that it was a major step forward in promoting the discussion of the Indochina issue. After Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong put forward the specific plan for the implementation of the military ceasefire on the 25th, the French newspaper "Franc-Tireur" immediately commented on the 26th: "The mood of the conference is dominated by the Viet Minh's speech. Due to its seriousness and objectivity, it has made an impression on most participants." The French "Combat" even pointed out in large headlines: "It is a crime to arbitrarily reject the Viet Minh's proposal." After Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai put forward the six principles, Agence France-Presse immediately reported that "French figures in Geneva expressed a good impression, and people emphasized that the Chinese minister's speech was of a nature to promote the progress of work." The French "Le Monde" pointed out on May 22nd: "In recent days, the progress of the conference has undoubtedly been driven by the East." The London "Times" said on the 26th: "Mr. Molotov is unwilling to allow the conference to be further delayed." It can be seen that the consistent constructive efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam to promote the Geneva Conference to achieve peace in Indochina are obvious to all.
    However, throughout the entire discussion of the Indochina issue, people can often see the hesitation and three-steps-forward-two-steps-back attitude shown by the French delegation under the coercion of the United States, especially the American delegation, which has been blatantly obstructing and sabotaging the conference since the first day the Indochina issue began to be discussed. It desperately grabs the three puppet governments of Bao Dai and Laos and Cambodia as tools for its sabotage of the conference. When the conference discussed the issue of achieving a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina, the United States instigated the representatives of Laos and Cambodia, these talking machines, to make a big fuss, insisting that there was only so-called "Viet Minh aggression" in Cambodia and Laos, and that the Geneva Conference must handle the Cambodian and Laotian issues separately. The United States' despicable intention to deliberately instigate them to prevent the Geneva Conference from achieving peace in Indochina and ending the Indochina war is well known. When Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's proposal put forward the issue of troop regrouping areas for both sides, that is, the adjustment of areas on both sides, the United States again instigated the representative of the Bao Dai government to clamor that this was a de facto partition, and they demanded unification. The United States apparently attempted to confuse the division of troop regrouping areas after the ceasefire with the so-called partition in order to achieve its goal of sabotaging the conference.
    But these despicable tactics of the United States cannot deceive anyone, because Article 3 of Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's proposal on May 10th stipulates: "Hold free general elections in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Hold consultative conferences of representatives of the governments of both sides in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos respectively, and under the condition of guaranteeing the freedom of action of patriotic parties and social organizations to prepare for and hold free general elections, establish a unified government in each country, and foreign interference is not allowed." In fact, no one has ever denied at the Geneva Conference that the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos should have their own unified government, but some unreasonable demands put forward at the conference are actually hindering the true democratic unification of the three Indochinese countries. The division of military regrouping areas proposed by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in his May 25th proposal is only for the sake of stability and genuine implementation of the ceasefire when discussing the military part, and must not be confused with "partition." The United States' opposition to the zoning of troops on both sides is actually opposition to a ceasefire in Indochina, making it impossible for the Indochina war to truly end and for peace to be achieved. But the trouble is that the US representatives, in order to oppose Pham Van Dong's proposal, that is, to oppose the ceasefire in Indochina, inadvertently revealed their true colors. They insisted a few days ago on discussing only a military ceasefire and not a political settlement, but now they are using the so-called "opposition to partition" to obstruct the discussion of a military ceasefire.
    Even the Western bourgeois newspapers are somewhat impatient with this situation. The British "Daily Herald" pointed out on May 25th: The delay in the Geneva "negotiations so far is mainly due to the chaos in the West"; the French "Le Monde" criticized on May 21st: The Western countries "are ignoring reality... Insisting on separating the Cambodian and Laotian issues from the Vietnamese issue, and discussing the Cambodian and Laotian issues first, is useless, which is wasting time." The Geneva Conference has been held for so long, and only the first agreement has been reached on the Indochina issue. Isn't the responsibility for the delay very clear?
    The British proposal adopted at the May 29th meeting is a step towards achieving a military ceasefire, a definite and positive step. But in order for the Indochina ceasefire to be implemented, representatives of the commanders of both sides must specifically delineate the troop regrouping areas and carry out area adjustments, and it is especially important that the conference continue to discuss the other four points in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's May 27th proposal, namely, at the same time as the cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina, the issue of stopping the entry of reinforcement military materials from outside Indochina, the issue of neutral nation supervision of the ceasefire, the issue of international guarantees of the ceasefire, and the issue of the release of prisoners of war. There are already signs that the United States will continue to carry out sabotage, and in the past secret meetings, it has not expressed any opinion at all on stopping the entry of reinforcement military materials from outside Indochina. On the issue of ceasefire supervision, it has expressed disagreement with supervision by neutral countries, demanding that the United Nations, that is, the United States, carry out supervision. On the issue of international guarantees, it has never expressed its willingness to undertake the obligation of jointly consulting and taking collective measures against acts that violate the agreement. It is not difficult to predict that the United States will continue to cause trouble on these issues. And it will continue to grab the three puppets of Bao Dai Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia, and continue to carry out coercion to obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference and undermine the true realization of a ceasefire in Indochina. This cannot but arouse people's vigilance.
    The task currently facing the world's peaceful and democratic forces is to consolidate the existing achievements, continue to thwart American sabotage and delaying tactics, and further strive to promote the Geneva Conference to accelerate its progress and achieve the restoration of peace in Indochina as soon as possible.　May 30th in Geneva

    继续击破美国的怠工和破坏
    本报记者　吴文焘　杜波
    在五月二十九日举行的关于印度支那问题第八次秘密会议上，日内瓦会议一致通过了英国提出的为了达成在印度支那迅速同时停火的建议。
    正如会议公报所说的，这个建议规定：为了早日在印度支那同时实现停战，印度支那交战双方司令官应立即派遣代表在日内瓦直接协商并在当地开始接触，研究双方在停止敌对行动后双方军队的部署问题，首先研究在越南的军队重新集结地区问题，并向日内瓦会议尽快提出报告和建议。这是日内瓦会议开始讨论恢复印度支那和平问题以来所通过的第一个决议。无疑地，这是日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论中的一个重要的进展。
    具有特别意义的是，这个决议是一致通过的，在会议上没有任何一个国家的代表团反对这个建议，虽然有些代表团保留一些意见。
    为了谋求早日在印度支那全境同时停战，越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联代表团在日内瓦会议上曾经作了不断的努力。在五月十七日印度支那问题进入秘密讨论的时候，首先碰到的一个问题就是美国和法国坚持只谈军事停战不谈政治解决；经过莫洛托夫和其他关心印度支那和平的外长们的努力，才使会议取得了讨论程序问题的协议。这就是以范文同和皮杜尔的两个建议以及莫洛托夫的补充建议作为讨论基础，军事问题与政治问题都谈，军事问题优先讨论。接着莫洛托夫外长在五月二十一日的会议上提出了五个问题，把会议上已提出的建议中有关军事的部分归纳起来，作为讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的军事部分的基础。这样就使会议进入了军事停战的实质问题的讨论。
    在五月二十五日的第六次秘密会议上，范文同代外长作了重要的发言，提出了在印度支那全境同时停战的具体实施方案，又使会议前进了一步。在五月二十七日第七次秘密会议上，我国周恩来外长根据各次会议讨论的结果提出了一个在印度支那停止敌对行动的六点基本原则的建议。这个建议中包括了各方观点中所存在的共同点，以作为获致某些协议的基础，以便会议能够进一步协商尚存的分歧。第八次秘密会议上所通过的英国建议，基本上符合周恩来外长二十七日建议中的头两点，而周恩来外长的建议的总的精神就是，谋求在印度支那全境早日同时停止敌对行动，实现和平。
    苏联、越南民主共和国和中国代表团所作的这些努力，有力地推动了会议的进展，表现了三国人民谋求和平的真诚意志，在各国人民和舆论中获得了良好的反响。当莫洛托夫外长提出使会议进入军事部分的实质讨论的五个问题时，舆论界普遍认为那是使印度支那问题的讨论推进了一大步。范文同代外长在二十五日提出关于军事停战实施的具体方案后，法国“义勇军报”二十六日立即评论道：“掌握会议情绪的是越盟的发言。由于它的认真而客观，对大多数与会者造成了印象。”法国“战斗报”更以大字标题指出：“武断地拒绝越盟的建议是罪恶的。”周恩来外长提出六点原则后，法新社立即报道说，在日内瓦的“法国人士中表示印象良好，人们着重指出中国部长的发言具有促使工作进展的性质”。法国“世界报”五月二十二日指出：“近几天来会议的前进无疑是由东方推动的。”伦敦“泰晤士报”二十六日说：“莫洛托夫先生不愿让会议进一步拖延。”可见中、苏、越三国为推动日内瓦会议获致印度支那和平的一贯的建设性努力是有目共睹的。
    但是在印度支那问题的整个讨论过程中，人们时常可以看到法国代表团在美国的挟制下所表现的犹豫和进三步退两步的态度，特别是美国代表团，它从印度支那问题开始讨论的第一天起，就一直明目张胆地在对会议进行阻挠和破坏，它拼命抓住保大和寮国高棉的三个傀儡政府作为它破坏会议的工具。当会议讨论到在印度支那全境同时实现停战的问题时，美国就指使寮国和高棉代表这些会说话的机器大吵大闹一通，硬说在高棉和寮国只有所谓“越盟侵略”，日内瓦会议必须把高棉、寮国问题单独处理。美国这种故意唆使它们阻止日内瓦会议获致印度支那和平结束印度支那战争的卑鄙用心是路人皆知的。当范文同代外长的建议中提出关于双方军队集结地区，也就是双方地方调整的问题时，美国又嗾使保大政府代表出来叫嚷，说什么这是实际上的分治，他们要求统一。美国显然企图把停战实现后双方军队集结地区的划分和所谓分治混淆起来，以达到它破坏会议的目的。
    可是美国的这些卑劣的手法是骗不过任何人的，因为范文同代外长在他五月十日建议中的第三条规定：“在越南、高棉与寮国举行自由普选。在越南、高棉与寮国国内，分别举行双方政府代表的协商会议，并在保证爱国党派与社会团体有行动自由来筹备并举行自由普选的条件下，在各该国建立
  一个统一的政府，不允许有外来的干涉。”事实上，任何人从来没有在日内瓦会议上否定越南、高棉、寮国人民应有他们自己的统一政府，可是有些人在会议上提出的一些无理主张，实际上是阻碍印度支那三国的真正的民主的统一的。范文同代外长在五月二十五日建议中所提出军事集结地区的划分，只是在讨论军事部分时，为了停战的稳固和真正能够实施，绝不能与“分治”混为一谈。美国反对双方分区集结部队，实际上就是反对在印度支那停战，要使印度支那战争无法真正停止，和平无法实现。可是糟糕的是美国代表为了反对范文同的建议，实即反对在印度支那停战，却不小心露出了马脚，他们在几天以前还坚持只谈军事停战，不谈政治解决，现在自己却又在讨论军事停战时用所谓“反对分治”来进行阻挠。
    对于这种情况，连西方资产阶级的报纸都有些不耐烦了。英国“每日先驱报”五月二十五日指出：日内瓦“谈判至今的拖延，主要是由于西方的混乱”；法国“世界报”五月二十一日批评道：西方国家“由于忽视现实……坚持高棉、寮国问题与越南分开，并首先讨论高棉、寮国问题，这是无用的，这就是消磨时间”。日内瓦会议开了这样久，才在印度支那问题上取得第一个协议，拖延的责任在那里，不是非常清楚的吗？
    五月二十九日会议所通过的英国建议，是导向实现军事停战的一个步骤，一个肯定的积极的步骤。但是为了使印度支那停战得以实施，还必须双方司令官的代表具体划定双方军队的集结地区和进行地区调整，而且特别重要的是会议还要继续商谈周恩来外长五月二十七日建议中的其他四点，即在印度支那全境停止敌对行动的同时，停止自印度支那境外进入增援性军火物资问题，停战的中立国监察问题，国际保证停战问题，关于释放战俘问题。已有迹象表明，美国还是会要继续进行破坏的，并且在过去的各次秘密会议上，它对停止自印度支那境外进入增援性军火物资还完全没有表示意见。在停战监察问题上，它已表示不同意由中立国监察，要求由联合国实即美国来监察。在国际保证问题上，它一直没有表示愿意承担共同协商对破坏协定的行为采取集体措施的义务。不难预料，在这些问题上，美国一定还会要继续捣乱的。并且它还会继续抓住保大越南、寮国王国和高棉王国等三个傀儡，继续进行要挟，以阻挠日内瓦会议的进展，破坏印度支那停战的真正实现，这是不能不引起人们警惕的。
    目前摆在世界和平民主力量面前的任务是巩固已有的成果，继续击破美国的破坏和怠工，进一步努力促使日内瓦会议加速向前进展，早日实现恢复印度支那的和平。　五月三十日于日内瓦
