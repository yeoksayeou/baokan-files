To implement the policy and mission of local state-owned industries to "serve the lives and production of the local people, and serve the local state-owned enterprises," factories under the Beijing Municipal Local Industry Bureau are continuously trial-producing and producing various new products.

In the first quarter of this year, factories successfully trial-produced 107 new products, of which 89 have already been put into production; in the second quarter, factories plan to trial-produce and produce 221 new products. Among the 328 new products, 283 have never been produced before, and 45 are improved specifications and designs. These new products not only support industrial construction and national basic construction, but also appropriately meet the needs of people's lives; some products can also replace imported goods.

Currently, the Beijing People's Electrical Machinery Factory is trial-producing and producing Soviet-style oil switches and distribution panels for new non-ferrous metal factories, and producing fully enclosed low-voltage and high-voltage platform switches suitable for mechanized coal mining operations for the coal mining industry (this type of switch can prevent gas explosions and water intrusion in the mine, ensuring safe mine production), and is manufacturing loom switches and three-position switches for the textile industry, which is a key construction project (these two new products can not only ensure the safe operation of the loom but also enable workers to scientifically master the machine). Ventilation fans and universal switchers for factories and mines (extremely important machines for industry, previously imported from abroad) are currently being trial-produced. The Beijing Reagent Research Institute is mass-producing and producing metallurgical and chemical analysis reagents and catalysts (these products were mostly imported from abroad in the past). The Beijing Timber Factory is using waste materials to trial-produce lightweight wood wool boards (lightweight, suitable for ceilings, wood wool board doors, and partitions; heavyweight, suitable for walls). This type of wood wool board is not only fire-resistant (it only carbonizes and does not burn at a high temperature of 1300 degrees), but also soundproof, sound-absorbing, heat-insulating, and heat-preserving, making it suitable for high-rise buildings. The Beijing Glass Factory is rushing to produce various skylight glass for the Soviet Exhibition Hall (this glass can be inlaid on walls or laid on the ground; it has a great refractive power and is particularly elegant when decorated in the hall).

The Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill, the Beijing Knitting and Dyeing Mill, the People's Knitting Factory, and the People's Garment Factory will add dozens of brightly colored and novelly designed silk and wool and cotton and wool textiles in the second quarter of this year, such as tuxedo wool, ladies' wool, single-sided tweed, as well as various colored fabrics and various new styles of knitted goods. The Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory is preparing to produce more than a dozen new medicines for rural use. The Beijing Ice Factory has begun mass production of cool drinks for citizens' summer use - popsicles and ice cream in the second quarter of this year. The Beijing Musical Instrument Factory is trial-producing various new musical instruments such as pianos, accordions, and Xinjiang drums; folding accordions have begun production, and their form is exquisite and easy to carry.

In the process of trial-producing new products, many factories try their best to use substitutes for production to save raw materials and overcome the difficulties of insufficient imported materials. For example, the Qinghe Woolen Mill uses tussah silk instead of part of the wool to make more than a dozen new silk and wool blended products. Some factories have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improved product design during the trial production process. (Deng Ping)

    北京市地方工业所属各厂
    陆续试制和生产大量新产品
    为贯彻地方国营工业“为当地人民的生活和生产服务、为当地的国营企业服务”的方针和任务，北京市地方工业局所属各厂，正陆续试制和生产各种新产品。
    今年第一季度各厂试制成功的新产品有一百零七种，其中八十九种已投入生产；第二季度各厂计划试制和生产新产品有二百二十一种。在三百二十八种新产品中，有二百八十三种是过去没有生产过的，有四十五种是改进规格花样的。这些新产品不仅支援了工业建设和国家基本建设，而且可适当地满足人民生活需要；某些产品还可代替进口货。
    现在，北京人民电机厂正为新型的有色金属工厂试制和生产苏联式的油开关和配电盘，为煤矿工业生产适于矿井井下机械化采煤用的完全封闭式的低压和高压台型开关（这种开关可用以防止矿井下的瓦斯爆炸和水分侵入，保证矿井安全生产），并为重点建设的纺织工业制造布机开关和三得开关
  （这两种新产品既可以使布机安全运转，又可以使工人科学地掌握机器）。厂矿用的通风机和万能切换器（它是工业极为重要的机器，过去都由国外输入），正在试制中。北京试剂研究所正大量试制和生产冶金和化学分析试剂、触媒剂（这些产品过去多由国外进口）。北京木材厂正利用废料试制了轻质木丝板（轻型的可作天花板、木丝板门、隔墙用；重型的可作墙壁用）。这种木丝板既耐火（在一千三百度的高温中，它只炭化不燃烧），还能隔音、吸音、隔热、保暖，适用于高层建筑物。北京玻璃厂正为苏联展览馆赶制各种采光玻璃（这种玻璃可以镶在墙壁上，也可以铺在地上；它有很大的折光力，在馆内装饰起来，也分外雅致）。
    北京清河制呢厂、北京机织印染厂、人民针织厂、人民被服厂，将在今年第二季度增加数十种色泽鲜艳、式样新颖的丝毛、棉毛纺织品，如礼服呢、女士呢、单面花呢，以及各种色布和各种新式的新花样的针织品。北京制药厂正准备生产十余种供农村用的新药品。北京制冰厂，今年第二季度已开始大量生产供市民夏季用的清凉饮料——冰棍和冰淇凌。北京乐器厂正试制各种钢琴、手风琴、新疆鼓等新乐器；折叠式风琴已开始生产，它的形式玲珑精致，携带方便。
    在试制新产品的过程中，许多工厂都尽量设法使用代用品进行生产，以节省原材料，并克服进口物资不足的困难。如清河制呢厂利用榨蚕丝代替部分羊毛，制成丝毛混纺的十多种新产品。有的工厂在试制过程中，学习了苏联的先进经验，改进产品设计。　　（邓平）
