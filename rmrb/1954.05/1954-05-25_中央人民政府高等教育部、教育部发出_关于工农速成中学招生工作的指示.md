The Central People's Government Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education Issue Instructions Regarding Enrollment Work for Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools

This year, worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools across the country will enroll 30,000 new students (equivalent to the total number of students currently enrolled in worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools nationwide). To this end, the Central People's Government Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Education have issued instructions regarding the enrollment work for worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools in 1954. The instructions pointed out: This is an extremely arduous political and organizational task. To ensure the completion of the enrollment plan and further improve the quality of new students, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over the enrollment work. All major administrative regions must organize enrollment leading bodies, which, under the unified leadership of the Party committee and the People's Government, will lead the enrollment work of the entire region. The main tasks of this body are to determine specific methods for completing the tasks based on the region's enrollment tasks and the enrollment conditions stipulated by the central government, to lead and inspect the enrollment work of the entire region, and to promptly solve problems in the work to ensure the quantity and quality of new students. Education departments (bureaus) of all provinces (cities) should also establish leading bodies for enrollment work, and carry out enrollment work in their respective provinces (cities) under the leadership of the regional enrollment committee (including worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools attached to universities). The enrollment work of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools attached to universities in Beijing and Tianjin will be carried out under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and the North China Education Bureau, with the municipal education bureaus taking specific charge of leadership and arrangements.

Regarding the composition of enrolled students, the instructions emphasized: We must strive to enroll more industrial workers, especially model workers. When recruiting revolutionary soldiers and state employees, priority should be given to admitting worker-peasant cadres with many years of revolutionary experience and bearing certain leadership responsibilities, but outstanding guards and communicators should also be appropriately admitted according to their qualifications. During the review process, all localities should conscientiously grasp the "Regulations on Enrollment Conditions for Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools in 1954" issued by the Central Ministry of Education and enroll those who are of excellent character, good health, have a cultural level equivalent to a senior primary school graduate, and have long-term training potential. Industrial workers should generally be assigned to worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools attached to higher industrial schools or with Category II teaching plans (science and engineering).

    中央人民政府高等教育部、教育部发出
    关于工农速成中学招生工作的指示
    今年，全国各地工农速成中学将招收新生三万名（相等于全国工农速成中学现有在校学生的总数）。为此，中央人民政府高等教育部、教育部发出了关于一九五四年工农速成中学招生工作的指示。指示中指出：这是一项十分艰巨的政治任务和组织任务。为保证完成招生计划，进一步提高新生的质量，必须加强对招生工作的领导。各大行政区须组织招生领导机构，在党委及人民政府统一领导下，领导全区的招生工作。这一机构的主要任务是根据本区招生任务及中央规定的报考条件，确定完成任务的具体办法，领导与检查全区的招生工作，及时解决工作中的问题，以保证新生的数量和质量。各省（市）教育厅（局）亦应成立招生工作的领导机构，在大区招生委员会的领导下进行本省（市）的招生工作（包括高等学校附设工农速成中学）。京津两市高等学校附设的工农速成中学的招生工作，由各该市教育局在当地党委和华北教育局统一领导下，进行具体的领导和安排。
    关于招收学生的成分，指示中强调指出：必须争取多招产业工人，特别是劳动模范。在招收革命军人和国家工作人员时，首先应吸收有多年革命锻炼的，负有一定领导责任的工农干部入学，但优秀的警卫员、通讯员亦应根据条件适当吸收。各地在审查时，应切实掌握中央教育部“关于一九五四年工农速成中学报考条件的规定”，将品质优秀、身体健康，有高小毕业文化程度并具有长期培养条件者录取入学。产业工人录取后，一般应分配在高等工业学校附设的或有第二类教学计划（理工科）的工农速成中学学习。
