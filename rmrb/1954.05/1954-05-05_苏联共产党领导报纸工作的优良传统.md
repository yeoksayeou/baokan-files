The Excellent Tradition of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Leading Newspaper Work
Bai Ruyuan

Today is the Soviet Press Day. The 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), held in 1922, adopted the decision to designate the day of the founding of "Pravda" in 1912 as the National Press Day. The Soviet newspapers, headed by "Pravda," are the most powerful ideological and organizational tool for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state to build a new life. The Soviet newspapers have this role because it is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. For the fifty years since its establishment, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always maintained and developed the excellent tradition of leading newspaper work.

This tradition is concentrated in the great importance attached to newspaper work by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its leaders. Since he began participating in revolutionary activities, Lenin regarded journalism as the most important cause in his life. During his exile in Siberia, he wrote: If I can write more and better things for the workers, that is my greatest wish. When Lenin drafted the plan for building the party in 1899, he made the establishment of a revolutionary Marxist newspaper the first step in building the party, and personally led it after the publication of this newspaper—"Iskra." Shortly after the publication of "Iskra," Stalin founded and led the "Struggle" newspaper in Georgia, which faithfully supported the propositions of "Iskra." "Pravda," which was born in 1912 with the upsurge of the new revolutionary movement and according to the suggestions of the workers in Petrograd, worked under the leadership of Lenin. Lenin pointed out from his practice of leading the revolution that the role of newspapers—"newspapers are not only collective propagandists and collective agitators, but also collective organizers," and stipulated the principles of the party spirit, ideological nature, and mass nature of newspapers. Lenin not only armed the Bolshevik newspapers before and after the October Revolution with the principles he created regarding newspaper work, but also educated newspaper workers and millions of people with his diligent labor in personally participating in newspaper work, becoming the highest example for them to learn from. Before the October Revolution, Lenin published more than fifty papers in "Iskra"; more than forty papers in "Vperyod"; one hundred papers and short articles in "Proletary"; eighty papers in "The Social Democrat"; during the period from April to October 1917, "Pravda" was destroyed by the bourgeois provisional government, and Lenin still wrote nearly two hundred papers for the "Pravda" published underground. In addition to actively participating in newspaper work himself, Lenin also emphasized the use of organizational and collective forces to run newspapers. In "What is to be Done?", he pointed out that local organizations should first care about the all-Russian newspaper and first work for the all-Russian newspaper; in another article, Lenin wrote: "It is a wrong idea that it seems that only writers and only writers can successfully participate in the work of the central newspaper; on the contrary, only when there are five hundred and five thousand non-writing staff members at the same time for every five leading and regular writing writers, will the central newspaper be lively and alive." In 1918, during his treatment in the hospital, Lenin, in addition to considering the issue of national and party construction, also paid special attention to the issue of newspaper work; when his health recovered, the first article he wrote was "On the Nature of Our Newspapers," in which he put forward the tasks of newspapers and periodicals during the transition from capitalism to communism.

After the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union discussed newspaper work at its successive congresses, stipulated the tasks of newspapers according to the tasks of the party in each period, and systematically made resolutions on newspaper work. For example, in the resolution on the party and Soviet press at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919, it was pointed out that: "The congress believes that without a good press, there can be no sound and strong party and Soviet construction." It also pointed out that: the party committee's leadership of the newspaper should be to give the editorial department general political guidelines and instructions, and to supervise the implementation of these guidelines and instructions, but not to interfere in the details of the editorial department's daily work; pointed out that the party's central organ newspaper should pay special attention to the issue of party building; one of the important tasks of the party and Soviet press is to expose the various crimes of responsible persons and various organs, point out the errors and shortcomings in the party and Soviet organs; local newspapers should pay special attention to targeting general mass readers, etc. The Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which was convened in preparation for the transition to the peaceful work of restoring the national economy, pointed out that the party's press should become a powerful tool for arousing labor competition. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union began to establish a nationwide newspaper network after the October Revolution. At that time, in addition to strengthening "Pravda" and establishing other central-level newspapers, it paid special attention to running mass peasant newspapers, trade union newspapers, and publishing newspapers in ethnic minority areas and border areas. In March 1918, the Party Central Committee decided to run the mass-based "Poor Peasants' Newspaper," and also ran peasant newspapers in various ethnic regions, provinces, and counties. In 1921, the Party Central Committee made a resolution on the program of local newspapers. After the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the party systematically made resolutions on strengthening local newspapers and developing the worker-peasant correspondent movement. Therefore, from the period of national economic recovery to the period of the first five-year plan, many factory newspapers, district newspapers, and wall newspapers were founded in various parts of the Soviet Union; many worker-peasant correspondents were united around the central newspapers and local newspapers; these grassroots newspapers and worker-peasant correspondents played a great role in closely linking the party with the masses and implementing the party's general line and the party's tasks in each period. After the end of the Great Patriotic War in 1945, the Party Central Committee made a resolution to improve local newspapers, and proposed the task of the newspapers to publicize the post-war five-year plan and mobilize the masses to launch a competition to strive for the completion and over-completion of the five-year plan. In addition to giving newspapers programmatic instructions in a certain period, the CPSU Central Committee promptly explained the party's instructions and intentions to the newspapers. For example, after the September Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in 1953, it convened a meeting of the editors-in-chief of newspapers in various republics, border regions, and states to discuss the tasks of the newspapers in implementing the policies of the party and the government. At the meeting, Comrade Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, made a report.

In the initial charter of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, there was a provision that the responsible editor of the central party organ newspaper was appointed by the Central Committee. After the October Revolution, after stipulating the work program of the newspapers in various periods, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarded the selection, deployment, and training of cadres as the primary task of the party in leading the newspapers. In view of improving the quality of newspapers, it is necessary to strengthen the leading backbone of the newspaper editorial department. In 1922, the Party Central Committee pointed out that the state committees and provincial committees should appoint members of the party committees who are quite familiar with this business and have authority to be responsible and practical editors of the newspapers; select comrades with strong party spirit to participate in the editorial committee, and must transfer as many registered journalists as possible to work in newspapers. In 1927, in order to improve the party's leadership over the press and strengthen the press with the necessary personnel, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee made the following resolution: the Party Committee should include the issue of the press in its work plan and submit it to the Standing Committee and plenary meetings of the Party Committee for discussion; The Party Committee should give the press timely instructions on conducting the most important campaigns, and give them instructions on the procedures and nature of explaining the party's life and various construction issues; Party committees at all levels must, in addition to the staff of the party organs, also attract party members working in the Soviet organs, various industry organizations, cooperative organs, and scientific organs to participate in the work of the press; Party committees at all levels must convene the staff of the editorial and publishing organs of the press on time in order to instruct them to implement the party's resolutions, and to discuss various issues related to the work of the press and the improvement of the work of the press. During the period of the first five-year plan, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee made a resolution in 1930, pointing out that: in order to transform the newspapers, first of all, it is necessary to explain economic issues, and require the absorption of new activists (worker-peasant correspondents—shock team members, economic workers, experts, etc.) to participate in newspaper work; pointed out that it is now resolutely necessary for the party organizations to pay special attention to cadres in newspaper work, and to ensure the implementation of the Central Committee's resolution on selecting comrades from the Standing Committee of the Party Committee to leave the party affairs work and be the editor-in-chief; worker-peasant correspondents—shock team members are one of the main sources of cadres in newspaper work, and these cadres are widely trained by newspapers at all levels through short-term training classes, groups, etc.; and it was decided that Marxist training classes (editorial department), Communist Journalism College, publishing work departments of various local Communist higher schools, and journalist night universities should respectively train cadres from the central level to the county level, as well as factory newspapers and collective farm newspapers. After the Patriotic War, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee decided that the journalism classes of party schools at all levels and the journalism departments of various universities should train and re-train newspaper staff and reserve personnel. The charter of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved by the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stipulate that party committees at all levels have the power to appoint the editorial departments of party organs that work under their leadership and supervision. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has taken this series of measures to gradually solve the problem of cadres in newspaper work.

After making resolutions and instructions on newspaper work, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union paid great attention to checking the extent to which the newspapers implemented the party's resolutions and instructions, and how the newspaper editorial departments implemented the party's resolutions and instructions on newspaper work. For example, in 1945, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee made a resolution to improve local newspapers. The resolution stipulated that it is necessary to reflect local life more deeply and reflect the work of the party and the Soviet more widely; a month and a half later, the Party Central Committee checked the implementation of this resolution by selecting the national newspapers on Sunday for inspection. Based on the inspection results, a resolution was made; the party committees of the republics, border regions, and states checked the newspaper work and proposed measures to improve the newspaper work according to the Central Committee's resolution. In 1946, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee again checked the implementation of the resolution one year ago, and the Party Central Committee sent a working group to three state newspapers (Rostov "Hammer Newspaper", Kursk "Pravda", and Kubyshev "Volga Commune Newspaper") to check, and after the inspection, a resolution was made on further improving these three state newspapers. The All-Union
(Bolsheviks) Central Committee instructed the above three state committees in the resolution to implement the following methods to strengthen the editorial departments of these state newspapers and improve the leadership of these newspapers: 1. Dispatch a group of skilled workers to strengthen various departments of the editorial department; 2. Equip the correspondent network of newspapers in various districts within one month; 3. The Standing Committee of the State Committee examines the newspaper work plan every month; 4. The Standing Committee of the State Committee listens to the reports of the editor-in-chief of the state newspaper at least twice a year, and implements the system of listening to the reports of the group leaders of the editorial department; 5. Each state newspaper establishes an editorial committee. Other Soviet newspapers also improved their work according to this resolution. In order to carry out daily supervision and management of newspaper work, the propaganda departments from the central to the state of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have working departments that play this functional role—the newspaper office or the press office. In addition, the CPSU Central Committee regards "Pravda" as an ideological tool for leading newspapers. "Pravda" often publishes reviews of newspapers and periodicals, summarizes newspaper experience, and criticizes newspaper shortcomings, playing the role of "newspaper of newspapers."

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet newspapers headed by "Pravda" have become the most powerful ideological and organizational tools for building the party and the Soviet state, building socialism and communism, and connecting and influencing the broadest masses from before the October Revolution to the several five-year plan periods after the victory of the revolution. In the Soviet Union, newspapers, as the mouthpiece of the party, occupy a very important position in social life; the personnel assigned to newspaper work by the party regard engaging in newspaper work as the most noble and honorable work.

The Chinese Communist Party, with Comrade Mao Zedong as its representative, has always attached great importance to the people's newspaper cause. Under the leadership of the party, the newspaper cause of our country, with Marxism-Leninism as its guide and the newspapers led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as its model, has always had revolutionary traditions, so it has played a great role in various periods of the Chinese revolution. At present, our country has entered a period of planned economic construction. Further strengthening the party's leadership over the newspapers, making the newspapers a powerful assistant in implementing the general line and a bridge for the party to closely connect with the masses, is of great significance to the socialist construction cause. The newspapers, standing at the forefront of the struggle, can only better play the role of collective propagandists, collective agitators, and collective organizers under the leadership of the party to further improve and innovate, and become a powerful weapon for the party to lead the people to build a new life.

    苏联共产党领导报纸工作的优良传统
    白汝瑗
    今天是苏联的出版节。一九二二年召开的俄共（布）第十一次代表大会，通过将一九一二年“真理报”创刊的这一天作为全国的出版节的决定。苏联以“真理报”为首的报纸，是苏联共产党和苏维埃国家建设新生活的最有力的思想工具和组织工具。苏联报纸具有这种作用是和苏联共产党的领导分不开的。苏联共产党建立后的五十年来，始终保持着和发扬了领导报纸工作的优良传统。
    这种传统集中地表现在苏联共产党和党的领袖十分重视报纸工作。列宁从开始参加革命活动时起，就把新闻事业当作他生活中最主要的事业。他在西伯利亚的流放期间曾写过：如果我能为工人们写更多更好的东西，那就是我最大的愿望。列宁在一八九九年拟定建党计划时，把创办一个革命的马克思主义的报纸作为建党的首要步骤，并于这个报纸——“火星报”出版后，亲自领导了它。“火星报”出版后不久，斯大林在格鲁吉亚创办了并领导了忠实支持“火星报”主张的“斗争报”。一九一二年随着新的革命运动高涨并根据彼得堡工人的建议而诞生的“真理报”，是在列宁的领导下进行工作的。列宁从他领导革命的实践中，指出报纸的作用——“报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且还是集体的组织者”，规定了报纸的党性、思想性、群众性等原则。列宁不仅以他所创造的关于报纸工作的原理武装了十月革命前后的布尔什维克的报纸，而且还以他亲自参加报纸工作的勤奋的劳动，教育了报纸工作者和千百万人民，成为他们学习的最高榜样。十月革命以前，列宁在“火星报”上发表了五十多篇论文；在“前进报”上发表了四十多篇论文；在“无产者报”上发表了一百篇论文和小文章；在“社会民主党人”上发表了八十多篇论文；在一九一七年四月到十月的期间，“真理报”遭受到资产阶级临时政府的破坏，列宁仍给在地下出版的“真理报”，写了将近二百多篇论文。列宁除了自己积极参加报纸工作外，还强调运用组织力量和集体力量办报。他在“做什么？”一书中，指出地方组织首先应关怀全俄报纸，首先应为全俄报纸工作；在另一篇文章中，列宁写道：“这是一个错误的想法，好像就是作家而且只有作家才能够成功地参加机关报工作；相反的，只有在每有五个领导的和经常写作的作家，就同时有五百个和五千个非作家的工作人员的时候，机关报才会是活泼而有生命的。”一九一八年列宁在医院疗养期间，除了考虑国家和党的建设问题以外，还特别考虑到报纸工作问题；当他的健康恢复后，他写的第一篇文章即“论我们报纸的性质”，在这篇文章中，提出了从资本主义过渡到共产主义时期的报刊任务。
    在苏维埃政权成立以后，苏联共产党在历次的代表大会上都讨论过报纸工作，根据党在每一时期的任务规定了报纸的任务，系统地作出关于报纸工作的决议。例如在一九一九年俄共（布）第八次代表大会关于党与苏维埃的报刊的决议中，就指出：“大会认为没有很好的报刊，就不能有健全的坚强的党和苏维埃建设。”并指出：党委对报纸的领导应是给编辑部以一般的政治方针和指示，并监督这些方针指示的执行，但不干预编辑部日常工作的细节；指出党的中央机关报应特别注意党的建设问题；党和苏维埃的报刊的重要任务之一乃是揭露负责人员及各机关内的各种犯罪行为，指出党和苏维埃机关内的错误和缺点；地方报刊应特别注意以一般群众的读者为对象等问题。在准备过渡到恢复国民经济的和平工作时期召开的俄共（布）第九次代表大会，指出党的报刊应成为激起劳动竞赛的强有力工具。苏联共产党在十月革命后即开始建立全国范围内的报纸网，当时除加强“真理报”和创办其他的中央一级的报纸外，特别注意办群众性的农民报纸、工会报纸和在少数民族地区与边疆出版报纸。在一九一八年三月，党中央即决定办群众性的“贫农报”，并在各民族地区、省、县级也办了农民报纸。一九二一年，党中央作出关于地方报纸的纲领的决议。俄共（布）第十一次代表大会以后，党对于加强地方报纸和开展工农通讯员运动都系统地作出了决议，因此，从国民经济恢复时期到第一个五年计划时期，在苏联各地创办了许多工厂报纸、区报、墙报；在中央报纸和地方报纸的周围团结了许多工农通讯员；这些基层报纸和工农通讯员在密切党与群众的联系，贯彻党的总路线和党在每一时期的任务方面，都起了很大的作用。一九四五年卫国战争结束后，党中央就作出改进地方报纸的决议，并提出报纸宣传战后五年计划和动员群众为争取完成和超额完成五年计划而开展竞赛的任务。苏共中央除在一定期间给予报纸以纲领性的指示外，并及时向报纸交代党的指示和意图。如在一九五三年苏共中央九月全会以后，即召集各共和国、边疆、州报的总编辑会议，讨论在贯彻党和政府的政策中报纸的任务，会上并由苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志作了报告。
    在最初的俄国社会民主工党党章中，就有了党中央机关报的负责编辑由中央委员会中任命的规定。十月革命后，苏联共产党在各个时期规定了报纸的工作纲领之后，就将选拔、调配和培养干部作为党领导报纸的首要工作。鉴于提高报纸的质量，必须加强报纸编辑部的领导骨干，党中央在一九二二年便指出州委会和省委会要任命相当精通本项业务的有权威的党委会的委员，作报纸的负责的并担负实际工作的编辑；选派党性坚强的同志参加编辑委员会，和必须把已经登记的新闻记者尽可能大量地调去作报纸工作。在一九二七年，为了改进党对报刊的领导和以必要的人员加强报刊工作，联共（布）中央作出下列的决议：党委会应把报刊问题列入自己的工作计划中，提交党委会的常委会和全体会议讨论；党委会应按时给报刊以关于进行最重要的运动的指示，并给它们以在说明党的生活和各种建设问题方面的程序和性质的指示；各级党委必须除了党机关工作人员以外，还要吸引在苏维埃机关、各业组织、合作社机关和科学机关中工作的党员来参加报刊的工作；各级党委必须按时召集报刊的编辑和出版机关的工作人员，以便指示他们执行党的决议，并讨论各种有关报刊工作与改善报刊工作的问题。在第一个五年计划时期，联共（布）中央在一九三○年又作出决议，指出：为了改造报纸，首先说明经济问题，要求吸收新的积极分子（工农通讯员——突击队员、经济工作者、专家等）参加报纸工作；指出目前坚决需要使党组织特别注意报纸工作干部，并保证实现中央关于从党委会的常委中选拔同志脱离党务工作而作总编辑的决议；工农通讯员——突击队员是报纸工作干部的主要来源之一，由各级报纸办短期训练班、小组等广泛培养这些干部；并决定由马克思主义训练班（编辑系）、共产主义新闻学院、各地方共产主义高等专门学校的出版工作系及新闻记者夜大学等校分别训练自中央一级至县级以及工厂报纸、集体农庄报纸的干部。在卫国战争以后，联共（布）中央决定由各级党校新闻班及各大学新闻系来培养和再培养报纸在职干部及后备人员。联共（布）党章和联共（布）第十九次代表大会所批准的苏联共产党党章，都规定了各级党委有委任在自己领导和监督之下进行工作的党机关报编辑部的权力。苏联共产党采取了这一系列的措施，便逐步地解决了报纸工作干部的问题。
    苏联共产党对于报纸工作做出决议和指示之后，很注意检查报纸对党的决议指示的执行程度及报纸编辑部如何实现党关于报纸工作的决议和指示。如在一九四五年，联共（布）中央作出改进地方报纸的决议，决议中规定必须更加深入地反映地方生活和更广泛地反映党和苏维埃的工作；一个半月以后，党中央即检查对这一决议的执行情况，方式是选择星期日这一天的全国报纸进行检查，根据检查结果作出决议；各共和国、边疆、州的党委即根据中央的决议，检查了报纸工作并提出改进报纸工作的措施。在一九四六年，联共（布）中央又检查一年前决议的执行状况，由党中央派工作组到三个州报（罗斯托夫“铁锤报”、“库尔斯克真理报”、古比雪夫“伏尔加公社报”）去检查，检查后作出关于进一步改进这三个州报的决议。联共
  （布）中央在决议中责成上述三个州委实施以下办法来加强这些州报编辑部和改善对这些报纸的领导：一、派遣一批熟练的工作人员以加强编辑部的各个部门；二、一个月内把各区报纸的通讯员网配备齐全；三、州委常委会每月考查报纸工作计划；四、州委常委会每年至少听取州报主编的两次报告，并实行听取编辑部各组组长报告的制度；五、各州报成立编辑委员会。苏联其他报纸也根据这个决议改进了自己的工作。为了对报纸工作进行日常的监督和管理，苏联共产党从中央到州的宣传鼓动部都设有起这种职能作用的工作部门——报纸处或报刊处。此外，苏共中央将“真理报”作为领导报纸的思想工具，“真理报”上经常发表报刊述评，总结报纸经验，批评报纸缺点，起着“报纸的报纸”的作用。
    在苏联共产党的领导之下，以“真理报”为首的苏联报纸，从十月革命以前到革命胜利后几个五年计划时期，都成为建设党与苏维埃国家、建设社会主义和共产主义、联系并影响最广大群众的最强有力的思想工具和组织工具。在苏联，作为党的喉舌的报纸，在社会生活中处在很重要的地位；被党分配做报纸工作的人员把从事报纸工作当做最崇高和荣誉的工作。
    中国共产党以毛泽东同志为代表对于人民的报纸事业，从来是十分重视的。我国人民的报纸事业在党的领导下，以马克思列宁主义作为指针，以苏联共产党所领导的报纸作为典范，一向具有革命传统，因此在中国革命的各个不同时期中都发挥了很大的作用。目前我们国家进入了有计划的经济建设时期，进一步加强党对报纸的领导，使报纸成为贯彻总路线的有力助手和党密切联系群众的桥梁，对社会主义的建设事业具有十分重大的意义。站在斗争前哨阵地的报纸，只有在党的领导下进一步改进和革新，才能更好地发挥集体的宣传者集体的鼓动者和集体的组织者的作用，成为党领导人民建设新生活的有力武器。
