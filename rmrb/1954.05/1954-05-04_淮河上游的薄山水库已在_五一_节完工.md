(Our dispatch from Kaifeng, 1st) The Bo Mountain Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Huai River was victoriously completed on "May Day" after two years of arduous construction. Zhao Wenfu, Second Deputy Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jia Xinzhai, Vice Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources, the Central and Southern Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Henan Provincial Huai River Harnessing Headquarters attended the completion ceremony of the reservoir. The Bo Mountain Reservoir is the fourth giant valley reservoir completed on the upper reaches of the Huai River after the Shi Man Tan, Bai Sha, and Banqiao Reservoirs. It has a storage capacity of 284 million cubic meters. It controls a basin area of 575 square kilometers above Bo Mountain on the Zhentou River, accounting for 49 percent of the total basin area. After the completion of this reservoir, benefits can be achieved in three aspects: In terms of flood control, the maximum flood seen on the Zhentou River above Bo Mountain in eighty years can be reduced from a flow rate of 2,720 cubic meters per second to 227 cubic meters per second. This can greatly reduce the burden on the downstream river channel. With the river channel management of the Hong and Ru rivers and the construction of polder storage projects, the Shi Man Tan and Banqiao reservoirs form a flood control line to block and store floodwater. This can basically protect three million mu of farmland along the lower reaches of the Hong and Ru rivers from flooding, and the lower reaches of the Zhentou River can be completely protected from waterlogging. In terms of irrigation, it can provide irrigation for 400,000 mu of wheat fields in the hilly areas downstream of the reservoir throughout the year. In addition, it is also planned to build a hydroelectric power plant to supply power for nearby agricultural product processing and rural lighting. The total annual value of the national wealth increased by flood control, irrigation, and power generation is approximately 55.54 million jin of wheat, and the agricultural bumper harvest on both banks of the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River can be guaranteed.

    淮河上游的薄山水库已在“五一”节完工
    【本报开封一日电】淮河上游的薄山水库，经过两年来的艰苦修建，已在“五一”节胜利完工。中共河南省委第二副书记赵文甫、河南省人民政府副主席贾心斋以及中央水利部、中南水利局、河南省治淮总指挥部的代表都参加了水库落成典礼。薄山水库是淮河上游继石漫滩、白沙和板桥水库之后完成的第四个巨型山谷水库，蓄水量二亿八千四百立方公尺，它控制臻头河薄山以上流域面积五百七十五平方公里，占流域总面积的百分之四十九。这个水库修好后，可以收到三方面的效益：在防洪方面，可使臻头河薄山以上八十年未曾见过的最大洪水，自二千七百二十秒公方流量降低到二百二十七秒公方，这可使下游河道的负担大为减轻，加以洪、汝河河道整理及洼地蓄洪工程的进行，石漫滩和板桥两水库，结成一条拦蓄洪水的防线，可使洪、汝河下游沿岸三百万亩农田基本上免除水患，臻头河下游则可全部免除水涝。在灌溉方面，常年可供给水库下游山坡地区四十万亩麦田灌溉。此外，还计划建筑水力发电厂以供给附近农产品加工和农村照明。全部防洪灌溉发电效益每年约可增加国家财富总值小麦五千五百四十万市斤，并可使淮河中下游两岸的农业丰产获得保证。
