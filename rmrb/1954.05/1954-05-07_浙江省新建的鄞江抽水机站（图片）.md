    The Newly Built Yinjiang Pumping Station in Zhejiang Province

    In the north of Nantang River in Yin County, Zhejiang Province, the state has established a pumping station. The pumping station here replaces the cattle-powered and manual irrigation of more than 7,000 mu north of Nantang, allowing more than 1,000 mu of "sun-parched fields" in the irrigated area to receive sufficient water. The picture above shows people welcoming the release of water. Yinjiang Pumping Station.
    Farmers in the Yinjiang Pumping Station irrigation area have built canals totaling 24 li in length. Workers are installing the pumps.
    Farmers in the irrigation area are engaged in timely spring plowing. With the pumping station, "rain-dependent fields" are no longer dependent on the weather.

    Farmers dug through the rocks at the foot of the mountain and built a "water bridge" - an aqueduct - over the river.

    浙江省新建的鄞江抽水机站
    在浙江省鄞县南塘河北面，国家建立了一个抽水机站。抽水机在这里代替了南塘以北七千余亩的牛力人力灌溉，使灌区一千余亩“哂煞田”得到足量的用水。上图是人们正在欢迎放水。鄞江抽水机站。
    农民在鄞江抽水机站灌区一共修筑了长达二十四华里的渠道。工人们正在安装抽水机。
    灌区的农民，正在及时春耕，有了抽水机站，“靠天田”不再靠天了。

    农民在山脚下挖通了岩石，在河上搭起了过水的“水桥”——渡槽。
