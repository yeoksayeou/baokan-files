Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 21st: State-owned farms in various parts of Southwest China are adopting diverse methods during the spring plowing season to promote advanced farming techniques to farmers. This year, most of the more than 300 state-owned farms across the region have signed technology combination contracts with local agricultural production cooperatives and better mutual aid teams. The combination contracts signed by the 15 state-owned farms in Mianyang Special District, Sichuan Province, and nearby mutual aid and cooperative organizations stipulate that the farms are responsible for technical guidance, supplying improved seeds and chemicals, renting out cattle and new-style farm implements, and guaranteeing "teaching, mastery, and repair." Eleven state-owned farms in Chongqing, Peng County, and other places in Sichuan Province and local mutual aid cooperatives have established technical research groups, which regularly study and improve farming techniques together. State-owned farms in Shuangliu County and Luzhou City hold exhibitions, using real objects and examples to introduce the advantages of new-style farm implements and advanced cultivation techniques to farmers. The state-owned farm in Xishui County, Guizhou Province, invites local old farmers to seminars to summarize the advanced experiences of farmers in production and use them to guide farmers to improve production technology. The state-owned Pixian mechanized farm in Sichuan Province also specifically held new-style farm implement training classes in February and March this year, cultivating more than 60 backbone members for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams under construction in Wenjiang Special District who can use new-style farm implements.
    Farmers in various parts of Southwest China warmly welcome the demonstration work of state-owned farms. Farmers in many areas affectionately call the farms "teachers" and actively learn advanced production techniques. According to statistics from four farms in Shifang and other counties in Wenjiang Special District, Sichuan Province, more than 1,100 mutual aid teams adopted advanced production technologies such as mud-water seed selection and sparse sowing of rice seeds after visiting the farm's technical demonstration.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Several state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province are strengthening continuous demonstration work of advanced production technologies. Each advanced technology in the cultivation process of various crops is interconnected. In response to this situation, many state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in various places are preparing to conduct continuous demonstrations on rice, from seed selection, seedling cultivation, transplanting, fertilization, and mid-season management to harvesting, and to educate farmers to fully accept advanced technologies through joint meetings of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, technical seminars, and other means. According to typical surveys in Wenjiang, Jiangjin, Yibin, Luzhou, Leshan, Nanchong, and other special districts, after demonstration education, 70% to 90% of farmers in the townships or villages are willing to continuously adopt mud-water seed selection, new-style seedling fields, using "666" powder to control rice borers, and appropriate close planting. This will have a significant impact on ensuring increased rice production in the province this year. In many state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives in cotton-producing areas, a series of advanced technology demonstrations will also be carried out from seed selection, hot-water seed treatment, soil pulverization, single-plant close planting, and pruning, and cadres or skilled producers will be dispatched to provide continuous teaching of advanced cotton planting techniques to fixed targets. In Suining Special District, a cotton-producing area, because state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives will promote a series of advanced technologies this year, cotton farmers have increased their confidence, and the cotton planting area in the entire district has expanded by 7% compared to last year.

    西南区国营农场推广先进技术
    大部农场和互助合作组织订立技术合同
    【新华社重庆二十一日电】西南区各地国营农场在春耕中采用多种多样办法，向农民推广先进耕作技术。全区三百多个国营农场今年大部分和当地农业生产合作社、较好的互助组订立了技术结合合同。四川省绵阳专区十五个国营农场和附近互助合作组织所订的结合合同中规定，农场负责指导技术，供应良种、药剂，租给耕牛和新式农具，并保证做到“包教、包会、包修理”。四川省崇庆、彭县等地十一个国营农场和当地互助合作组织成立了技术研究小组，经常在一起研究改进耕作技术；双流县和泸州市国营农场举办展览会，用实物和活人活事向农民介绍新式农具和先进栽培技术的优越性。贵州省鳛水县国营农场邀请当地老农民座谈，总结农民生产中的先进经验，用来指导农民提高生产技术。四川省国营郫县机耕农场今年二到三月份内还特地举办了新式农具训练班，为温江专区各农业生产合作社和正在建社的互助组培养了六十多个能使用新式农具的骨干分子。
    西南区各地农民热烈欢迎国营农场的示范工作。不少地区的农民亲热地把农场称作“老师”，积极学习先进生产技术。据四川省温江专区什邡等县四个农场统计，有一千一百多个互助组在参观农场技术示范后，采用了泥水选种和稀撒谷种等先进生产技术。
    【新华社成都讯】四川省若干国营农场和农业生产合作社正加强先进生产技术的连续示范工作。各种农作物耕作过程中的每项先进技术，都是联系着的，针对这种情况，各地许多国营农场和农业生产合作社准备在水稻方面从选种、育苗、插秧、施肥、中耕到收获，连续作示范，并通过农业生产合作社、互助组联席会议，技术座谈会等教育农民全面地接受先进技术。据温江、江津、宜宾、泸州、乐山、南充等专区典型调查，经过示范教育的乡或村，愿意连续接受泥水选种、新式秧田、以“六六六”药粉防治螟虫和适当密栽的农户达百分之七十到九十，这对保证今年全省水稻增产将有重大作用。在产棉区的许多国营农场和农业生产合作社，也要从选种、烫种、碎土、单株密植、整枝摘心等作一系列的先进技术示范，并派出干部或生产能手，固定对象作连续性的传授种棉先进技术。产棉区遂宁专区因为国营农场和农业生产合作社今年要一系列地推广先进技术，植棉户增强了信心，全区植棉面积比去年扩大百分之七。
