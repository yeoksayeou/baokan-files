    Shaanxi Province cotton farmers are actively carrying out cotton field management work such as checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, weeding, and preventing insect pests in various cotton-producing areas.
    Xingping County in Guanzhong has sown more than 126,600 mu of cotton fields, with generally complete emergence of seedlings and robust growth; some areas have broken rows and missing seedlings. The county leadership has mobilized cotton farmers to universally check and replant seedlings, and quickly formulated a cotton field management work plan. It proposed "early thinning, even spacing, and timely setting of seedlings," correcting the past error of "late setting of seedlings." The county has now carried out a first round of seedling checking and replanting.
    In the process of carrying out cotton field management, most agricultural production cooperatives can drive mutual aid teams to carry out cotton field thinning. The Shi Wang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Jingyang County planted 143 mu of cotton fields this year. Starting from May 7th, it mobilized 36 male and female cooperative members to thin seedlings and pull weeds in the 91 mu of cotton fields where emergence was earlier, replanted seedlings in 20 mu of cotton fields, and composted all the thinned seedlings and pulled weeds into fertilizer. The Third District People's Government organized more than 70 mutual aid team leaders from the entire district to observe the cotton seedling growth situation and the ongoing thinning, weeding, and replanting work of the Shi Wang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. This had a significant educational effect on the mutual aid team leaders who participated in the observation. After Kong Fanju, the leader of the mutual aid joint group in Wuzaifu Village, returned, he immediately convened a discussion with all the group members that evening. The next day, all the male and female group members went to the fields to thin seedlings and pull weeds. Within five days, they had thinned seedlings and pulled weeds in more than 60 mu of cotton fields, and also added seven composting pits. After the Xingju Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Sixth District of Hancheng carried out cotton field thinning work, working group cadres convened a forum with 24 mutual aid team leaders from the surrounding ten villages, introducing the cooperative's experience. After discussion, the idea of some mutual aid team leaders who did not want to replant seedlings or wanted to supplement the missing seedlings in the cotton fields with corn, millet, and other miscellaneous autumn crops was reversed, and they actively carried out replanting.

    陕西省棉农积极进行棉田管理工作
    陕西省各产棉区的农民，正在积极进行查苗、补苗、锄草、防虫等棉田管理工作。
    关中兴平县播种十二万六千六百多亩棉田，普遍出苗齐全，棉苗生长茁壮；部分地区有断条缺苗现象。该县领导方面已发动棉农普遍查苗、补苗，并迅速作出棉田管理工作计划。提出：“早间苗、留匀苗、适时定苗”，纠正过去“晚定苗”的错误作法。现在全县已进行了一次查苗、补苗工作。
    在进行棉田管理工作中，大部农业生产合作社都能带动互助组进行棉田间苗。泾阳县三区史王村农业生产合作社，今年种了一百四十三亩棉田，从五月七日开始，发动了三十六个男女社员在出土较早的九十一亩棉田中进行了间苗和拔草工作，在二十亩棉田中作了补苗工作，并把间下的苗和拔下的草全都沤了粪。三区人民政府组织了全区七十多个互助组组长，观摩了史王村农业生产合作社的棉苗生长情况和正在进行的间苗、拔草、补苗工作，对参加观摩的互助组组长教育作用很大。武寨府村的互助联组组长孔繁巨回去后，当天晚上就召集了全体组员讨论，第二天全组男女组员下地间苗、拔草，在五天内，已把六十多亩棉田间了苗、拔了草，还增加了七个沤粪坑。在韩城六区星聚农业生产合作社进行了棉田间苗工作后，工作组干部召开了周围十个村子中的二十四个互助组长举行座谈，介绍了该社经验。经过讨论，扭转了有些互助组长不想补苗或想在缺苗的棉地中补玉米、糜子等杂秋的想法积极进行补苗。　（本报西北记者站）
