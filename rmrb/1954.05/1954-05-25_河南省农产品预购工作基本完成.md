Henan Province Basically Completes Pre-Purchase of Agricultural Products

Henan Province has basically completed its pre-purchase task for agricultural products. The province has pre-purchased over 120 million jin of ginned cotton, 70 million jin of wheat, and over 150 million jin of peanuts, with a total deposit of 90 billion yuan. During the pre-purchase process, many regions, by helping farmers develop production plans and deposit usage plans, and strengthening the supply of materials, have enabled farmers to invest their deposits into production, powerfully supporting spring production and preparations for the summer harvest and planting. In Anyang Prefecture, cotton farmers in Ye County invested 90% of their advance deposits into production. In Lingbao County, Luoyang Prefecture, material supplies accounted for 85% of the advance deposits during the pre-purchase process in the Second District.

In the pre-purchase work, various localities also developed and consolidated mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For example, in counties such as Shanxian and Lingbao, 541 mutual aid teams were developed in conjunction with the pre-purchase of cotton, 34 mutual aid teams were rectified, and 2 mutual aid teams were transformed into cooperatives, all of which formulated plans to expand reproduction.

    河南省农产品预购工作基本完成
    河南省农产品预购任务已基本完成。全省已预购一亿二千多万斤皮棉、七千万斤小麦和一亿五千多万斤花生，共付出定金九百亿元。在预购中，很多地区通过帮助农民制订生产计划和定金使用计划，和加强物资的供应工作，使农民纷纷将定金投入生产，有力地支持了春季生产和夏收、夏种的准备工作。安阳专区邺县棉农把百分之九十的预付定金投入了生产。洛阳专区灵宝县二区在预购中供应物资占预付定金百分之八十五。
    各地在预购工作中，还发展与巩固了互助合作组织，如陕县、灵宝等县结合预购棉花发展互助组五百四十一个，整顿互助组三十四个，互助组转为合作社二个，并纷纷订了扩大再生产计划。
