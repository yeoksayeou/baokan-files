Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 18th: The spokesman for the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Geneva Conference, Hoang Van Hoan, held a press conference at the "House of Journalists" here at 2 p.m. on the 18th, explaining in detail to nearly 200 journalists from various countries the truth about the evacuation of seriously wounded personnel of the French Expeditionary Force captured in the Dien Bien Phu campaign.

Hoang Van Hoan first pointed out that in recent days, many newspapers in various countries have published information about the evacuation of seriously wounded French prisoners of war from the Dien Bien Phu campaign. However, this information is either not detailed enough or even intentionally distorted. Therefore, it is necessary to further explain and clarify the truth about the handling of the evacuation of seriously wounded French prisoners of war. Hoang Van Hoan said that the permission and preparation to transport the seriously wounded prisoners of war of the French Expeditionary Force in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, regardless of nationality or race, was first proposed by Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the Geneva Conference on May 10th. The French delegation also expressed acceptance of Pham Van Dong's proposal. Thus, based on the proposal of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Geneva Conference suggested that the relevant governments instruct the commands of both sides in Vietnam to hold on-the-spot consultations and implement specific measures to transport seriously wounded prisoners of war.

Hoang Van Hoan then said: At noon on May 13th, Professor Huard, a representative of the French Expeditionary Force, arrived in Dien Bien Phu by helicopter and met with Colonel Cao Van Khanh, a representative of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army. Professor Huard requested permission for the French side to use helicopters and Morane aircraft to transport seriously wounded prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu. The two sides reached the following agreement: (1) The seriously wounded prisoners of war will be transported in three batches, the first two batches including 753 people, and the number of the third batch will be determined by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army. (2) Eighty to one hundred people will be transported each day. (3) During the transportation of seriously wounded prisoners of war, the French Air Force will cease operations in a certain area, namely within 10 kilometers around Dien Bien Phu and on Highway 41 from Dien Bien Phu to Son La. On the evening of the 13th, Professor Huard returned to Dien Bien Phu from the French-occupied area, bringing a letter signed by General Cogny, commander of the French Expeditionary Force in North Vietnam, on behalf of General Navarre, expressing agreement with this agreement. General Cogny also telegraphed the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army on the same evening, expressing agreement with the above agreement.

Thus, the measures for the evacuation of seriously wounded prisoners of war, initiated by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and agreed to by the French delegation, were implemented on May 14th after the commands of both sides had reached an agreement on the specific steps involved. On that day, eleven seriously wounded prisoners of war were transported from Dien Bien Phu. During this period, the command of the Vietnam People's Army sent people to repair the airport to allow French helicopters and Morane aircraft to land. The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army also stated that it would strive to expedite the transportation of seriously wounded prisoners of war. For example, according to the agreement, 80 to 100 people could be transported each day, and the Vietnam People's Army expressed its willingness to strive to increase the number of people transported each day to 150. Not only that, but the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army also allowed the French side to send people to Dien Bien Phu to inspect the airport and visit the wounded, and allowed French medical personnel to go to Dien Bien Phu.

Hoang Van Hoan continued that, just as everything was proceeding smoothly, French Foreign Minister Bidault sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on May 14th, saying that the list of 450 wounded and prisoners of war designated by General Vo Nguyen Giap to be transported in the first batch did not include any Vietnamese personnel. Bidault also opposed the so-called "new demand" put forward by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, which actually referred to the agreement reached between the French Expeditionary Force and the Vietnam People's Army regarding the cessation of air force activities on Highway 41. On May 15th, Molotov stated in his reply to Bidault that the principle that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would not discriminate in terms of race and nationality among the wounded would be observed. All practical issues regarding the evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu should be resolved on the spot through consultations between the commands of both sides. Molotov also said that perhaps the French side believes that establishing direct relations with the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam now in Geneva would help clarify the resolution of the issue of mutually satisfactory procedures for the evacuation of the wounded. On the same day, May 14th, Bidault also sent a letter with the same content as the one he sent to Molotov to British Foreign Secretary Eden. Eden then sent a letter to Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in the name of the chairman of the conference, saying that there seemed to be some misunderstanding regarding Pham Van Dong's statement on May 10th, and therefore hoped that he would make another statement on the transportation of seriously wounded prisoners of war at the next meeting. On the 17th, Pham Van Dong replied to Eden, saying: He had explained the position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in his statement at the meeting on May 10th. Now, as in the past, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it is reasonable for the practical issues that may arise regarding the transportation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu to be resolved on the spot. Such a resolution is also underway.

Simultaneous with these exchanges of letters, the French authorities had begun to sabotage the agreement. On the 15th, they did not come to Dien Bien Phu to transport the wounded and prisoners of war. They still did not appear on the 16th. On the evening of the 17th, the French military authorities began bombing Highway 41, killing 15 wounded French prisoners of war who were being transported on the road. During the day on the 17th, after the second French delegation to Dien Bien Phu returned to Hanoi, the French High Commissioner in Indochina made a decision on his own, putting forward six ridiculous conditions, and saying that if the Vietnam People's Army did not accept these conditions, they would stop transporting the wounded and start bombing Highway 41. Among the six conditions they put forward, there was the so-called Highway 41 should be supervised by both sides, or if necessary by neutral countries, and a mixed committee should be organized by both sides to select the seriously wounded French prisoners of war to be transported.

The above are the facts regarding the transportation of seriously wounded French prisoners of war.

Hoang Van Hoan went on to explain that the statement by the French High Commissioner and the so-called issue of racial discrimination raised in Bidault's letter to Molotov were not actually problems. The Vietnam People's Army has consistently respected its promises and has never discriminated against wounded prisoners of war based on race or nationality. Bidault's claim that there were no Vietnamese wounded is unfounded. To clarify this further, it can be pointed out that in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the French Expeditionary Force deployed its most elite troops to defend its besieged fortress. Therefore, the number of Bao Dai troops in the French forces besieged in Dien Bien Phu was very small, about one-eighth of its total garrison, rather than the one-fourth claimed by the French side. During the battle, most of the Bao Dai puppet troops had already surrendered to the People's Army. In this light, it is not surprising that there were very few Vietnamese among the wounded French prisoners of war after the battle. It is also not surprising that there were no Vietnamese personnel among the first batch of eleven wounded and prisoners of war transported.

Hoang Van Hoan said: In the process of transporting seriously wounded prisoners of war, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army once again demonstrated its humanitarian spirit and faithfully and strictly adhered to its promises.

In contrast, the French side has tried its best to sabotage the agreement between the two sides on the transportation of the wounded and prisoners of war. They said that the weather was bad, or that the airport was not good. Of course, the climate and airport conditions would have some impact on the transportation of the wounded and prisoners of war, but if the French authorities had been sincere, made some efforts, and transported them continuously from the 13th, then a considerable number of wounded and prisoners of war could have been transported, and it would not have been just eleven.

Hoang Van Hoan said: The fact is very clear that the French military authorities are looking for all kinds of excuses to stop carrying out the humanitarian work that they are responsible for and that the Vietnam People's Army has allowed. This shows that the French authorities are not at all concerned about the fate of the seriously wounded prisoners of war who are waiting for planes to transport them. What is the reason for this? Hoang Van Hoan said that this is mainly because the French authorities are afraid of the truth. They are afraid that the wounded and prisoners of war released by the Vietnam People's Army will reveal the truth about the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the actual situation within the French Expeditionary Force. Not only that, but they are particularly afraid that the facts about the humanitarianism and magnanimity of the Vietnam People's Army will be spread. Professor Huard acknowledged and expressed his gratitude for this humanitarian spirit of the Vietnam People's Army after his first meeting with the representatives of the People's Army in Dien Bien Phu on May 13th. General Cogny also thanked the Vietnam People's Army for taking good care of the wounded in his letter and telegram on the same day. Not only that, but the statement by Major Grojean, a French military doctor captured in Dien Bien Phu, also illustrates this point. The wounded and prisoners of war who have arrived in Hanoi have also unanimously expressed their gratitude for the magnanimous treatment of the People's Army. They said: Not a single soldier in the People's Army has ever abused sick or wounded prisoners of war. French medical personnel were also allowed to take care of French sick and wounded personnel. Many captured French medical personnel, including nurse Deglaire, wrote to President Ho Chi Minh, expressing their gratitude for the humanitarianism and magnanimity of the People's Army.

Hoang Van Hoan said that the facts prove that the French ruling clique is completely unconcerned about the suffering of their sick and wounded prisoners of war. They talk about "humanitarianism" in their mouths, but in reality, they use the term "humanitarianism" as capital for political propaganda. Humanitarianism and magnanimity are on the side of the Vietnamese people, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam People's Army. This is the tradition of the Vietnam People's Army, and it has been proven by countless facts since the beginning of the war.

Hoang Van Hoan said that now, because the French authorities have not fulfilled their promises and are not acting in accordance with the agreement, the seriously wounded prisoners of war still have to remain in Dien Bien Phu, and the responsibility lies entirely with the French side.

Finally, Hoang Van Hoan expressed the hope that the French authorities, for the sake of humanitarianism, would fulfill their responsibilities so that the issue of evacuating seriously wounded prisoners of war could be resolved quickly.

### 越南民主共和国代表团举行记者招待会  揭露法国中断自奠边府撤运伤俘工作真相  指出法方破坏协议对伤俘未能尽速撤运应负完全责任

    越南民主共和国代表团举行记者招待会
    揭露法国中断自奠边府撤运伤俘工作真相
    指出法方破坏协议对伤俘未能尽速撤运应负完全责任
    【新华社日内瓦十八日电】越南民主共和国出席日内瓦会议代表团发言人黄文欢于十八日下午二时在此间“记者之家”举行记者招待会，向与会各国记者近二百人详细说明关于撤退在奠边府战役中被俘的法远征军重伤人员的问题的真相。
    黄文欢首先指出，数日来关于奠边府战役中法方重伤战俘的撤退，各国报纸有很多登载，但是这些消息或者不够详尽或者甚至是受意的歪曲报道，因此，关于处理法方重伤战俘的撤退事宜的事实真相，有进一步加以说明和澄清的必要。黄文欢说，允许并准备把奠边府战役中法远征军所属部队的重伤战俘，不分国籍及种族差别地让其运走一举，原是越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同在五月十日的日内瓦会议上首次提出的。范文同的这个建议，法国代表团方面也表示接受。这样，根据越南民主共和国代表团的建议，日内瓦会议建议有关双方政府，指令在越南的双方指挥部就地会商并实现一些具体办法以运送重伤战俘。
    黄文欢接着说：五月十三日中午，法远征军方面代表胡尔教授乘直升飞机抵奠边府与越南人民军总司令部代表高文庆上校会晤。胡尔教授请求允许法方以直升飞机及莫兰式飞机到奠边府运走重伤战俘。双方达成以下协议：（一）重伤战俘分三批运送，头两批包括七百五十三名，第三批人数由越南人民军总司令部决定之。（二）每天运送八十人到一百人。（三）在运送重伤战俘期间，法空军在一定地区即奠边府周围十公里内及从奠边府到山萝的第四十一号公路停止活动。十三日晚，胡尔教授自法军占领地区重回奠边府，带来北越法远征军司令戈涅将军代表纳瓦尔将军签字的信，信中表示同意这一协议。戈涅将军并又于同日晚电告越南人民军总司令部表示同意上述协议。
    这样，由越南民主共和国代表团所创议的并经法国代表团同意的撤退重伤战俘的措施在当地的双方司令部就有关具体步骤取得协议之后即于五月十四日开始实现，当日，有十一名重伤战俘从奠边府运走。在这期间，越南人民军指挥部派人修理机场以便法国直升飞机和莫兰式飞机降落。越南人民军总司令部并曾表示将努力促使重伤战俘尽速运送。例如按照协议每日可运送八十人到一百人，越南人民军方面曾表示愿努力争取将每日运送人数增至一百五十人。不仅如此，越南人民军总司令部并允许法方派人到奠边府看机场和探望伤员，允许法方医务人员到奠边府去。
    黄文欢接着说，正当一切工作顺利进行之际，法外长皮杜尔于五月十四日致函苏联外长莫洛托夫，说武元甲将军所指定的第一批运走伤俘四百五十人名单中未包括一名越南籍人员。皮杜尔在信中并反对所谓越南人民军总司令部“提出了一项新的要求”，实际上是指法远征军方面与越南人民军方面已经获致的关于在第四十一号公路上停止空军活动的协议。五月十五日，莫洛托夫在致皮杜尔的复函中称，越南民主共和国在伤员的种族和民族方面不作任何歧视的原则是将被遵守的。关于自奠边府撤退伤员的一切实际问题，均应由双方司令部就地协商解决。莫洛托夫并说，也许法国方面认为与现在日内瓦的越南民主共和国代表团建立直接关系，有助于澄清双方满意的撤退伤员程序问题的解决。五月十四日同一天，皮杜尔还以与他给莫洛托夫的同样内容的一封信致送英外交大臣艾登。艾登即以会议主席的名义致函越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同，说关于范文同五月十日的声明似乎发生了一些误会，因此希望他在下一次会上就运送重伤战俘事，再作一声明。十七日，范文同函复艾登说：他在五月十日会议上所作的声明中已说明了越南民主共和国的立场。现在和过去一样，越南民主共和国代表团认为关于自奠边府运送伤员一事可能产生的实际问题应就地解决，是合理的。这样的解决也正在进行中。
    与这些信件往返同时，法国当局已在开始破坏协议。十五日，他们没有到奠边府来运走伤俘。十六日仍未见来。十七日晚，法军当局即开始轰炸第四十一号公路，炸死正在路上运送的法方受伤战俘十五名。十七日白天，在法方到奠边府的第二个代表团回到河内以后，法驻印度支那高级专员即单独作出决定，提出六项可笑条件，并说如果越南人民军不接受这些条件，他们即将停止运走伤俘，并开始轰炸第四十一号公路。在他们所提的六项条件中，有所谓第四十一号公路应由双方、必要时由中立国监督，及由双方组织混合委员会选择运送法方重伤战俘等。
    上述各点便是运送法方重伤战俘的事实经过。
    黄文欢接着说明，法高级专员的声明和皮杜尔致莫洛托夫信中所提出的所谓种族歧视问题，实际上并不成为问题。越南人民军方面一贯尊重自己的诺言，从来不对受伤战俘分种族和国籍加以歧视。皮杜尔所谓没有越南伤俘一点是没有事实根据的。为了更清楚地说明起见，可以指出，此次奠边府战役中，法国远征军调派其最精锐部队防守其被围的要塞，因此法方在奠边府被围部队中，保大部队所占的人数极少，约为其全部守军的八分之一，而不是像法方所宣称的四分之一。在战斗过程中，大部分保大伪军业已投诚到人民军方面。这样看来，战役结束后法方受伤战俘中越南籍人数很少，是不足为奇的。最初一批运走的十一名伤俘中没有越南籍人员，也不足为奇。
    黄文欢说：在运送重伤战俘过程中，越南人民军总司令部又一次表现了人道主义的精神，忠实地和严格地遵守了诺言。
    与此相反，法方则竭力破坏双方关于运送伤俘的协议。他们不是说天气不好，就是说机场不好。当然，气候及机场条件会对运送伤俘发生一些影响，但如果法国当局有诚意、作些努力，并从十三日起不间断地运送的话，那末就能运走相当数量的伤俘，决不至于只有十一名。
    黄文欢说：事实很清楚，法军当局是在寻找一切借口以停止执行他们责有所归并经越南人民军方面允准的人道主义的工作。由此可见，法国当局对于正在等着飞机运送的重伤战俘的命运毫不关心。其原因在那里呢？黄文欢说，这主要的是因为法国当局害怕真理，他们害怕为越南人民军所释放的伤俘会泄露奠边府战事的真相，和法国远征军内部的实际情况。不仅如此，他们特别害怕越南人民军的人道主义和宽大精神的事实会因此传布出去。对于越南人民军这种人道主义的精神，胡尔教授于五月十三日在奠边府与人民军代表首次会晤后即已承认并表示感谢。戈涅将军在同日的函电中亦感谢越南人民军积极照顾伤员。不仅如此，在奠边府被俘的法军少校军医格罗温的声明中也说明了这点。已抵河内的伤俘也对人民军的宽大待遇一致表示感谢。他们说：人民军中没有一个战士曾经虐待过病伤战俘。法方医务人员并被允许去照顾法方病伤人员。有许多被俘的法方医务人员，包括德格拉尔女护士在内，都写信给胡志明主席，对于人民军的人道主义和宽大精神表示感谢。
    黄文欢说，事实证明，法国统治集团是完全不关心他们病伤战俘的痛苦的。他们嘴里说“人道主义”，实际上是用“人道主义”这个词句作为政治宣传的资本。人道主义和宽大精神是在越南人民、越南民主共和国政府和越南人民军方面。这是越南人民军的传统，并且是由从战争开始以来的无数事实所证明了的。
    黄文欢说，现在，由于法国当局没有履行自己的诺言，不按照协议行事，重伤战俘还不得不留在奠边府，其责任完全在法国方面。
    最后，黄文欢表示希望法国当局为了人道主义的缘故，履行自己的责任，使撤退重伤战俘的问题获得迅速的解决。
