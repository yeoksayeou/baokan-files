Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th. The remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Wuchiu Island off the coast of Fujian Province, under the continuous blows of our army, have suffered a collapse in morale. At the end of March and the beginning of April, a total of twenty-one bandit soldiers, including squad leader Ye Qingnian, soldiers Wang Zhang, and Liu Deming, crossed the sea and defected to our coastal defense forces. After their return, they were treated leniently by the People's Liberation Army and given appropriate living arrangements.

Most of those who defected, such as Ye Qingnian, were fishermen and peddlers from the coastal areas of Fujian who were abducted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits when they fled the mainland. After being forcibly drafted into the bandit army, they suffered oppression and pain, and yearned for their families. Many had long sought to surrender. Ye Qingnian and others said that due to the continuous blows of our Fujian Navy against the bandits entrenched on the coastal islands, the bandit soldiers on Wuchiu Island were very panicked, and more and more bandit soldiers were deserting. For this reason, the Chiang Kai-shek special agents stationed on Wuchiu Island implemented a brutal rule over the bandit soldiers, locking up some so-called "unstable elements" in "re-education teams," and executing, burying alive, or secretly killing those who had attempted to escape but were caught and returned.

    福建乌丘屿岛残余蒋匪二十一人
    越海向解放军海防部队投诚
    【新华社福州七日电】盘踞在福建省沿海乌丘屿岛上的残余蒋匪军在我军连续打击下，士气败坏，在三月底和四月上旬，先后有匪军分队长叶青年，士兵王璋、刘德明等二十一人越海向我海防部队投诚。他们归来后，受到人民解放军的宽待，并给予适当的生活安置。
    投诚归来的叶青年等大部分都是蒋匪逃离大陆时掳去的福建沿海渔民和小贩，他们被强迫编入匪军后，受尽压迫和痛苦，思家心切，许多人都久已企图投降，叶青年等说，由于我福建海军连续打击盘踞在沿海岛屿上的残匪，乌丘屿岛上的匪军都很恐慌，匪军士兵逃跑的越来越多。为此，蒋匪派驻乌丘屿的特务，对匪军士兵实行了野蛮的统治，把一些所谓“不稳分子”关进“管训队”，对逃跑未成又被抓回去的人就枪毙、活埋或秘密处死。
