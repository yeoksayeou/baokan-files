Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, June 6th: The Vietnam People's Army units on the Dien Bien Phu front have actively launched a sniper campaign. These bullets flying out from the mountains and forests have made the French troops besieged for many days even more restless, because they increase the enemy's casualties every day.

Since the northern and eastern defense lines were broken through, the French troops in Muong Thanh, the center of the Dien Bien Phu stronghold group, were completely exposed to the guns of the People's Army fighters who were perched high. On April 22nd, General Commander Vo Nguyen Giap called on the soldiers on the Dien Bien Phu front to launch a sniper campaign. The soldiers actively responded to this call. They cleverly hid in the mountains and forests around the Muong Thanh basin and in well-disguised fortifications, aiming at the exposed targets behind the French barbed wire. When the French troops cautiously crawled out to retrieve the supplies dropped by parachutes, they often fell down after being shot. Those French troops who flashed and hid like cats in the communication trenches could not escape the bullets of the snipers, and even the French troops in the fortifications were shot dead by bullets flying in from the loopholes.

The number of enemy troops killed by snipers is increasing day by day. One People's Army combat team knocked down five French troops on the first day, seven on the second day, and increased to eighteen on the third day. Four combat teams of a certain unit hit a total of 110 French troops in ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency on the 5th: According to news from the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos, the People's Liberation Armies of Cambodia and Laos killed and wounded a total of 13,856 enemy troops from April 1953 to the end of March 1954.

    奠边府前线越南人民军展开冷枪杀敌运动
    高棉、寮国人民解放军一年歼敌一万三千
    【新华社北越六日电】奠边府前线越南人民军各部队积极展开了冷枪杀敌运动。这些从山林中飞出去的子弹，使被围困多日的法国军队更加坐立不安，因为它们每天使敌人增加不少伤亡。
    自从北部和东部的防线被突破以后，奠边府集团据点中心芒清的法军，全部暴露在踞高临下的人民军战士的枪口之下。四月二十二日，武元甲总司令号召奠边府前线战士展开冷枪杀敌运动。战士们积极响应这个号召。他们巧妙地隐藏在芒清盆地四周的山林中和伪装得很好的工事里，瞄准着法军铁丝网后面暴露的目标。当法军小心翼翼地爬出来取降落伞投下的物资时，常常中弹倒下。那些像猫似地在交通壕里闪闪躲躲的法军，也不能逃脱狙击手的子弹，甚至在工事里的法军也有被从枪眼飞进去的子弹打死的。
    敌军死在冷枪下的人数正在逐日增多，有一个人民军战斗小组第一天打倒五个法军，第二天打倒七个，第三天增加到了十八个。某部队的四个战斗小组，十天内共打中法军达一百一十名。
    【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社五日讯：据从高棉和寮国的抗战政府得到的消息，高棉和寮国的人民解放军从一九五三年四月到一九五四年三月底为止，共毙、伤敌军一万三千八百五十六名。
