The Department of Forestry and the Department of Plant Protection of the East China Institute of Agricultural Sciences are collaborating on research into using parasitic wasps to control pine caterpillars. Focusing on Nanjing and Changshan in Zhejiang, they are investigating and collecting basic information on pine caterpillar parasitic wasps in various provinces of East China. This will facilitate further research on breeding and utilization to eliminate the harm caused by pine caterpillars.

In Zhejiang, staff are currently understanding and collecting pine caterpillar parasitic wasps from Changshan, Jiangshan, Tangxi, Dongyang, Shouchang, and other places, classifying and identifying them, and observing the occurrence of pine caterpillars and their environmental relationships near Changshan. In Nanjing, in addition to collecting pine caterpillar parasitic wasps from counties near Nanjing, communication and investigation collection bases have been established in state-owned forest farms and nurseries in mountainous areas of East China where pine caterpillars are severely harmful. This will allow for the widespread collection of pine caterpillar parasitic wasp materials, followed by identification of their species and parasitism rates. At the same time, a parasitic wasp breeding research laboratory is being planned to carry out breeding research, primarily focusing on egg parasitic wasps. Currently, more than ten kinds of pine caterpillar parasitic wasps have been collected near Nanjing. Among those already identified are Platygaster, which parasitizes pine caterpillar eggs; Ichneumon flies, which parasitize pine caterpillar pupae; and five types that parasitize pine caterpillar larvae: red-headed micromite wasps, broad-stalked Ichneumon flies, and black-chested Ichneumon flies. Their living habits are currently being observed, and necessary specimens are being prepared. Preliminary preparations are also underway to begin breeding research on Platygaster and preparing to breed Telenomus for trial release work.

Note: The pine caterpillar is one of the main forest pests, widely spread in southern forest areas, and also found in some areas of the north. In areas with severe infestations, pine needles are eaten clean, greatly hindering the growth of pine trees. The Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government notified all regions in March to carry out capture and killing, and to cooperate with scientific research departments to study fundamental solutions.

    华东农业科学研究所研究防治松毛虫办法
    华东农业科学研究所森林系和植物保护系，正在合作研究利用寄生蜂防治松毛虫，并以南京和浙江的常山为中心，调查收集华东各省松毛虫寄生蜂的基本情况，以便于进一步研究饲养、利用，以消灭松毛虫的为害。
    浙江方面的工作人员，正在了解采集常山、江山、汤溪、东阳、寿昌等地松毛虫寄生蜂，进行分类鉴定，并观察常山附近松毛虫的发生情况和环境关系。南京方面除采集了南京附近各县松毛虫寄生蜂外，并在华东各省松毛虫为害严重山区的国营林场苗圃，建立通讯调查采集基点，广泛收集松毛虫寄生蜂材料，进而鉴定其种类和寄生率。同时筹建寄生蜂培养研究室，进行以卵寄生蜂为主的饲养研究工作。目前在南京附近已经采到松毛虫寄生蜂十多种，其中已经定名的，有寄生在松毛虫卵内的平腹卵蜂，寄生在松毛虫蛹内的黑瘤姬蜂，寄生在松毛虫幼虫体内的红头小蜜蜂、阔柄姬蜂、及黑胸姬蜂等五种，现正观察其生活习性，制作必要的标本。并开始进行平腹卵蜂和准备进行长腹卵蜂的饲养研究，作试放工作的初步准备。
    按：松毛虫是森林主要害虫之一，南方林区蔓延很广，北方部分地区也有发现。虫害严重的地区，松针被吃得精光，大大妨碍了松树的成长。中央人民政府林业部在三月间已通知各地进行捕杀，并配合科学研究部门研究根治办法。　（吴志曾）
