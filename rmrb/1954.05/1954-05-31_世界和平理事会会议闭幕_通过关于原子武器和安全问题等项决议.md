Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 29th: The World Peace Council's special meeting in Berlin concluded on May 28th.

    Erwin Schärf, Chairman of the Austrian Socialist Workers' Party, spoke at the closing meeting. He said that the remilitarization of West Germany is fraught with particularly serious consequences for Austria, and that West Germany's threat to Austrian independence is a threat to the cause of peace. Schärf emphasized that the Austrian people resolutely oppose plans for a new German-Austrian merger and are fighting for peace and for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

    Dufek Dubi, a member of the Israeli parliament, spoke at the meeting, citing many examples of how American reactionaries are using the antagonism between Arabs and Jews to achieve their aims of preparing for a new war. The United States uses the "threat" of Israel to intimidate Arab countries, trying to get them to accept its military "aid," while at the same time using the "threat" of Arabs to intimidate Israel, attempting to force the Israeli people to accept the same enslaving "aid."

    General Edgar Buchbaum, Chairman of the National Committee Against the U.S.-Brazil Military Agreement, stated in his speech that the United States is adopting the means of openly interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, just as they have already done in Korea and are now doing in Indochina. American monopolists are using the "threat" of Guatemala, a country with a population of three million, as a pretext to prepare for armed intervention in Guatemala's internal affairs, attempting to drag the people of Latin American countries into a fratricidal war.

    Ivor Montagu (UK), a member of the World Peace Council, emphasized the true meaning of the concept of collective security. He said that collective security not only means possible collective punitive measures as a limiting factor, but also includes collective cooperation in the struggle for peace, cooperation among all countries without exception. Collective security means unhindered expansion of trade, striving to consolidate friendship and mutual understanding among peoples of all countries, and developing cultural and sports ties between countries around the world.

    Abdullah Adra, secretary of the Lebanese Entrepreneurs Association, spoke about the need to expand trade relations between countries around the world.

    Also speaking at the closing meeting were: Rao Dud (India), Reiner Poer, leader of the Swiss non-violent resisters, Colonel Alfredo de Amaesti, Chairman of the Chilean Peace Committee, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Professor Orlov of the Soviet Union, and Josef Wirth, former Chancellor of the Weimar Republic.

    After listening to Paul Robeson's congratulatory message, the meeting began discussing proposals.

    The meeting then elected new members of the World Peace Council, its Standing Committee, and its Secretariat.

    The meeting also passed the following three resolutions:

    Resolution on Atomic Weapons

    Weapons of indiscriminate destruction threaten the people of all countries. The conscience of the world is awakening. Parliaments, politicians, and the highest religious and moral authorities are protesting.

    We, representing the peoples of all countries, demand the implementation of extremely urgent measures: the conclusion of an international agreement prohibiting the further testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs and prohibiting the use of these weapons. Such an agreement would prepare and facilitate the formulation of effective measures to ensure the complete prohibition of these weapons. Such an agreement would help to ease international tensions in the shortest possible time, would lead to universal disarmament, and would pave the way for joint cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

    We call upon all organizations and individuals who desire peace, we call upon all political, trade union, religious, and cultural organizations, and men and women of all countries, to work together within their own countries and internationally to enable governments to reach an agreement on the following basis: the prohibition of the production, stockpiling, and use of all weapons of mass destruction under complete, practical, and strict international supervision.

    Berlin, May 28, 1954

    Resolution on Security Issues

    The threat of expanded war due to American military intervention in the Indochina conflict; the pressure exerted to establish the "European Defense Community" which would legitimize the rearmament of West Germany; the division of Europe and Asia caused by the policy of military treaties; the thermonuclear weapons tests conducted for the purpose of intimidation and blackmail - all of these are the reasons why the people of all countries, after the glimmer of hope in negotiations, have once again fallen into anxiety.

    The public opinion movement in various countries, which had achieved the armistice in Korea and the start of negotiations on European and Asian issues, is today capable of achieving the following goals:

    Achieving a successful conclusion to the Geneva Conference, namely a ceasefire in Indochina and a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Korea and Indochina;

    Rejecting the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and resuming negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the German question;

    Governments of all countries reaching an agreement on stopping the testing of atomic weapons and not using atomic weapons.

    Although countries have different political and social systems, the people of all countries have common interests. Conducting atomic blackmail and dividing the world into military blocs cannot safeguard this common interest, nor can it guarantee the security of each individual and the independence of each country. The suppression of national liberation movements and interference in the internal affairs of various countries threaten this common interest.

    One's own security cannot be guaranteed if the security of others is not guaranteed. All relevant countries, regardless of their different social and political systems, must first establish common security in Asia and Europe.

    Berlin, May 28, 1954

    Recommendations of the Cultural Committee

    1.  In recent months, there has been encouraging progress in cultural exchange. The numerous conferences held by intellectuals, the performances of art and films, the mutual visits of delegations from various countries, the commemorations of world cultural figures and outstanding works, and the meetings of teachers, scientists, students, and athletes, etc., all prove that the people of all countries hope to exchange the fruits of their labor, technological advancements, and achievements in science and art.

    2.  At the same time, in order to develop the inherent culture of each country and spread knowledge to the broad masses of the people, various countries have launched extensive movements, and these movements have grown stronger. This movement opposes any attempt to stifle national culture, as such attempts are an infringement on national sovereignty. This movement strives to assist the production of works that can enrich the cultural treasures of each nation and expand international exchange.

    3.  Although exciting achievements have been made in cultural exchange and the development of national cultures, these achievements do not match the actual possibilities. There are still many obstacles that prevent the people of all countries from fully enjoying the fruits of human wisdom. It is inconceivable that administrative or political obstacles would be suitable for freedom of thought, freedom of action, and freedom of circulation of works. Such obstacles should be eradicated. These obstacles can be removed if all those who cherish culture recognize their responsibilities and firmly support any initiative aimed at eliminating these obstacles, further developing national cultural activities, and expanding cultural exchange (regardless of where this initiative comes from).

    The people of all countries hope that culture should serve friendship and peace between the people of all countries.

### 世界和平理事会会议闭幕  通过关于原子武器和安全问题等项决议

    世界和平理事会会议闭幕
    通过关于原子武器和安全问题等项决议
    据新华社三十日讯：据塔斯社柏林二十九日讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议已于五月二十八日闭幕。
    奥地利社会主义工人党主席埃尔文·谢尔夫在闭幕会议上发言。他说，西德重新军国主义化充满了对奥地利特别严重的后果，西德对奥地利独立的威胁就是对和平事业的威胁。谢尔夫着重指出，奥地利人民坚决反对新的德奥合并的计划，他们正在为和平、为禁止大规模毁灭性武器而斗争。
    以色列议会议员杜斐克·杜比在会议上发言，他举出许多例子来说明美国反动集团如何在利用阿拉伯人和犹太人之间的对立来达到准备新战争的目的。美国用以色列的“威胁”来威吓阿拉伯国家，力图使阿拉伯国家接受它的军事“援助”，同时又以阿拉伯的“威胁”来威吓以色列，企图强迫以色列人民接受它同样的奴役性的“援助”。
    巴西反对美国—巴西军事协定全国委员会主席埃德加·布希鲍姆将军在他的发言中指出，美国正在采取公开干涉拉丁美洲国家内政的手段，正如它们已经在朝鲜和现在在印度支那所采取的手段一样。美国垄断资本家正以三百万人口的危地马拉威胁了美国为借口，准备武装干涉危地马拉的内政，企图把拉丁美洲国家人民拉入自相残杀的战争之中。
    世界和平理事会理事艾弗·蒙塔古（英国）着重谈到集体安全的概念的真正的意义。他说集体安全不仅意味着作为限制因素的可能的集体惩罚措施，而且还包括在争取和平斗争中进行集体合作，一切国家毫无例外地进行合作的因素。集体安全意味着不受障碍地扩大贸易，争取巩固各国人民的友谊和互相谅解，发展世界各国间的文化和体育联系。
    黎巴嫩企业家协会书记阿卜杜拉·阿德拉谈到扩大世界各国贸易关系的必要性。
    在闭幕会议上发言的还有：拉奥·杜德（印度），瑞士非战主义者领袖雷纳·波瓦尔，智利和平委员会主席艾尔弗雷多·德·阿迈斯蒂上校，中国作家协会主席茅盾，苏联的奥尔洛夫教授和前魏玛共和国总理约瑟夫·维尔特。
    在听了保罗·罗伯逊的贺词后，会议开始讨论提案。
    接着会议选举了世界和平理事会的新理事，它的常务委员会和书记处。
    会议还通过了三项决议如下：
    关于原子武器的决议
    盲目地毁灭一切的武器在威胁着世界各国人民。世界的良心在觉醒中。议会、政治家、最高的宗教与道德权威人士都在提出抗议。
    我们代表各国人民要求采取极端紧迫的措施：缔结不准再试验原子弹与氢弹并不准使用这些武器的国际协定。这种协定会准备和促进制定有效的措施，保证完全禁止这些武器。这种协定会有助于在最短时期内缓和国际紧张局势，会导致普遍地裁减军备，会为共同合作利用原子能于和平目的铺平道路。
    我们号召愿望和平的一切组织和个人，我们号召一切政治、工会、宗教、文化组织和各国男女，共同来在本国和国际范围内设法使各国政府之间在下述基础上达成协议：在完全切实可行的严格的国际监督下，禁止生产、储存和使用一切大规模毁灭性的武器。
    一九五四年五月二十八日于柏林
    关于安全问题的决议
    可能导致战争扩大的美国军事干涉印度支那冲突的威胁；为了建立会使重新武装西德合法化的“欧洲防务集团”而施用的压力；军事条约政策使欧洲和亚洲陷入的分裂；为了进行威吓讹诈而又进行的热核子武器试验——所有这一切都是在谈判初露端倪之后各国人民又陷于忧惧的原因。
    各国的舆论运动曾经获致了朝鲜的停战和欧洲与亚洲问题谈判的开始，这一运动今天是能够达到下列目的的：
    使日内瓦会议胜利结束，即在印度支那停火与和平解决朝鲜与印度支那的冲突；
    拒绝波恩条约与巴黎条约，恢复和平解决德国问题的谈判；
    各国政府就停止试验原子武器和不使用原子武器达成协议。
    虽然各国的政治制度和社会制度不同，但各国人民具有共同的利益。而进行原子讹诈和把世界分裂成军事集团，是既不能维护这种共同的利益，也不能保障每个人的安全和各国的独立的。对民族解放运动的镇压以及对各国内政的干涉，威胁着这种共同的利益。
    别人的安全得不到保障，自己的安全也就不可能得到保障。一切有关国家，不管它们的社会和政治制度不同，必须首先在亚洲和欧洲建立共同的安全。
    一九五四年五月二十八日于柏林
    文化委员会的建议
    一、最近几个月在文化交流方面有了令人鼓舞的进展。知识分子举行的许多大会，艺术和电影的表演，各国代表团的互相访问，世界文化名人以及优秀作品的纪念会，教师、科学家、学生和运动员等等的会晤都证明，各国人民希望交换自己劳动的成果，技术的进步，科学和艺术的成就。
    二、同时，为了发展每个国家固有的文化，把知识传播给广大的人民群众，各国展开了广泛的运动，并且这个运动已经壮大了。这个运动反对任何扼杀民族文化的企图，因为这类企图是对国家主权的侵犯。这个运动努力协助可以丰富每个民族的文化宝库和扩大国际交流的那些作品的产生。
    三、虽然在文化交流方面和民族文化的发展上获得了令人兴奋的成绩，但是这些成绩并不符合实际的可能性。目前还存在着许多障碍，这些障碍阻挠着各国人民充分享受人类智慧的成果。不能想像行政的或政治的障碍会适合思想的自由、行动的自由和作品流通的自由。这类障碍应当根除。凡是珍视文化的人，如果都认识到自己的责任并坚决支持旨在扫除这种障碍，进一步发展民族文化活动和扩大文化交流的任何倡议（不管这种倡议来自何方），那么，这类障碍是能够被扫除的。
    各国人民希望文化应当为各国人民之间的友好与和平服务。
    一九五四年五月二十八日于柏林
