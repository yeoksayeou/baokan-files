China's publishing industry has seen significant development in recent years. Currently, there are over eighty state-owned, joint state-private, and private publishing houses and institutions that publish a considerable number of books nationwide. This includes thirty-one state-owned and joint state-private publishing houses at the central level and forty-one state-owned and joint state-private publishing houses at the local level. Most of these publishing houses were established after Liberation. In recent years, the number of titles and volumes of books published nationwide has been increasing annually. In 1953, the number of book titles published nationwide was 258.2 percent of that in 1950, and the number of volumes was 272.5 percent of that in 1950. Before Liberation, the average print run for each book was only two to three thousand copies; in 1953, the average print run for each book reached over 41,000 copies.

Most of China's publishing houses are established based on the principle of specialized division of labor. Among the state-owned and joint state-private publishing houses at the central level, there is the People's Publishing House, a specialized publisher of political books; the Life·Reading·New Knowledge Bookstore, which publishes general social science books; the Workers' Publishing House, which publishes books and periodicals for trade union cadres and workers; and the China Youth Publishing House, a specialized publisher of books for young people and children. In order to continuously improve the political and cultural level of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and grassroots cadres, the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House was established in 1953. The specialized textbook publishers include the People's Education Publishing House and the Higher Education Publishing House. There are eleven specialized publishing houses that publish scientific and technological and production management books for industry, agriculture, transportation, and other economic and financial departments, including the Geological Publishing House, the Heavy Industry Publishing House, the Fuel Industry Publishing House, the Textile Industry Publishing House, the People's Railway Publishing House, and the Finance and Economics Publishing House. In order to develop basic scientific research and popularize scientific knowledge, the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Association for Science and Technology also frequently publish books. In the fields of literature and art, in addition to the China Youth Publishing House and the Workers' Publishing House publishing some literary books, there are also specialized publishers such as the People's Literature Publishing House, the Writers' Publishing House, the Art Publishing House, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, and the Morning Flower Fine Arts Publishing House. The Era Publishing House publishes books introducing the Soviet Union's communist construction and Sino-Soviet friendly relations, as well as Russian language learning books; it also publishes some translated Soviet literary works. The Nationalities Publishing House is responsible for publishing books in the languages of various fraternal ethnic groups and books on ethnic issues. The World Knowledge Press specializes in publishing books on international issues. The Foreign Languages Press publishes books and periodicals introducing the construction of new China in various aspects to the people of the world and strengthening international cultural exchange. In addition, there are the People's Health Publishing House and the People's Sports Publishing House. The Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company, which have a long history in China's publishing industry, continue to undertake the task of publishing ancient books, modern academic works, and language learning materials. Local publishing houses in various regions are responsible for publishing intermediate-level political reading materials and local political, economic, and cultural books, some of which are also specialized publishers of ethnic, literary, and art books. Over the past few years, these publishing houses across the country have played a significant role in educating the people with Marxism-Leninism, publicizing and explaining national policies to the people, and providing the people with scientific and cultural knowledge.

The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao occupy the most prominent position in China's publishing industry. From 1949 to 1953, more than 15.4 million copies of the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were printed; during the same period, more than 25.5 million copies of Chairman Mao's works were printed. In addition, the print run of many political books exceeded one million copies. Since 1949, more than 2.47 million copies of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" have been printed; more than 4.24 million copies of Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" have been printed.

With the development of economic construction and education, the number of scientific and technological books and textbooks published has greatly increased. In recent years, the largest increase in the number of book titles has been in natural sciences and production technology books; textbooks for schools at all levels account for the largest proportion of the total number of copies printed. In 1953, the number of textbooks published increased by 1.15 times compared to 1950, with an average print run of more than 480,000 copies per textbook.

The literary works of Chinese writers and translated Soviet literary books have played an important role in educating the people, especially the broad masses of young people, in the spirit of communism. Soviet literary works such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "An Ordinary Soldier," and "Gulia's Path," and Chinese literary works such as "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," "The Hurricane," "Bronze Walls and Iron Bastions," and "Dedication to the Party" have all had a profound educational impact on the people. These books have large print runs. For example, the book "The Story of Zoya and Shura" had a total print run of 1.28 million copies in two years. The Popular Reading Materials Publishing House, which has close ties with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, has published 44 kinds of popular political and cultural books from its establishment in September last year to the end of April this year, including "Publicizing the General Line to Farmers," which has been printed in more than 2 million copies. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Morning Flower Fine Arts Publishing House have published more than 16.6 million picture albums and more than 103 million pictures in recent years. Among them, comic strips such as "Chicken Feather Letter" and "Child Laborer," New Year pictures such as "Chairman Mao Talking with Farmers" and "The Bride Speaks," and political propaganda posters such as "Tell Volunteer Army Uncles Your Study Results" and "We Love Peace" have become popular works among the broad masses. The print runs of "The Bride Speaks" and "We Love Peace" and others have exceeded 1.4 million copies.

    我国出版事业几年来有很大发展
    我国出版事业近几年来有很大发展。目前，国营、公私合营和出版书籍较多的私营出版社和出版机构，全国有八十余家，其中包括中央级的国营和公私合营的出版社三十一家和地方性的国营和公私合营的出版社四十一家。这些出版社大部分是在解放以后建立的。几年来，全国书籍出版的种数和册数，每年都在增加。一九五三年，全国出版书籍的种数，为一九五零年的百分之二百五十八点二，册数为一九五零年的百分之二百七十二点五。解放以前，每种书的印数，平均只有二、三千册；一九五三年，平均每种书的印数达四万一千余册。
    我国出版社大都是按专业分工的原则建设的。在中央级的国营和公私合营出版社中，有专业的政治书籍出版社——人民出版社，有出版一般社会科学书籍的生活·读书·新知三联书店，出版供工会干部和工人群众阅读的书刊的工人出版社，以及专业的青年和少年儿童读物出版社——中国青年出版社。为了不断地提高广大工农兵群众和基层干部的政治水平和文化水平，在一九五三年，成立了通俗读物出版社。专业的教科书出版社，有人民教育出版社和高等教育出版社。出版工业、农业、交通运输和其他财经部门的科学技术和生产管理书籍的专业出版社，有地质出版社、重工业出版社、燃料工业出版社、纺织工业出版社、人民铁道出版社、财政经济出版社等十一个。为了发展基本科学研究工作，普及科学知识，中国科学院编译局和中华科学技术普及协会也经常出版图书。在文艺美术方面，除中国青年出版社、工人出版社都出版一部分文艺书籍外，还有专业的人民文学出版社、作家出版社、艺术出版社、人民美术出版社和朝花美术出版社。出版介绍苏联共产主义建设事业和中苏友好关系及俄文学习书籍的，有时代出版社；它同时也出版一些翻译的苏联文艺著作。负责出版各兄弟民族文字的图书和有关民族问题的书籍的，有民族出版社。专门出版国际问题书籍的，有世界知识社。出版向世界各国人民介绍新中国各方面建设情形，加强国际文化交流的书刊的，有外文出版社。另外、还有人民卫生出版社和人民体育出版社。在我国出版界有悠久历史的商务印书馆和中华书局，仍担负着出版古代书籍、近代学术著作和语文学习等读物的任务。各地的地方性出版社，担负着出版中级政治读物和地方性的政治、经济、文化书籍的任务，其中也有专业的民族、文艺和美术出版社。全国这些出版社，几年来，在用马克思列宁主义教育人民，向人民群众宣传和解释国家政策，供给人民群众以科学和文化知识等方面，都起了很大的作用。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作和毛主席的著作，在我国出版事业中居于最显著的地位。从一九四九年到一九五三年，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的经典著作，共印行了一千五百四十余万册；同一时期，毛主席的著作印行了二千五百五十余万册。此外，还有不少政治书籍的印数超过了百万册。刘少奇同志的“论党”，从一九四九年以来，共印行了二百四十七万余册；胡乔木同志的“中国共产党的三十年”，印行了四百二十四万余册。
    随着经济建设和教育事业的发展，科学技术书籍和教科书的出版数量大为增加。近年来，书籍种数增加最多的是自然科学和生产技术书籍；在印数上占比重最大的是各级学校的教科书，一九五三年教科书出版册数，比一九五零年增加了一点一五倍，平均每种教科书印行四十八万余册。
    中国作家的文艺作品和翻译的苏联文艺书籍，在以共产主义精神教育人民群众，特别是广大青年方面，起了重要的作用。如“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”、“普通一兵”、“古丽雅的道路”等苏联文艺作品，和“太阳照在桑乾河上”、“暴风骤雨”、“铜墙铁壁”、“把一切献给党”等中国文艺作品，都对人民群众起了深刻的教育作用。这些书籍的印数都很大，如“卓娅和舒拉的故事”一书，两年当中共印行了一百二十八万册。和广大工农兵群众有密切关系的通俗读物出版社，从去年九月间成立到今年四月底止，已出版了四十四种通俗政治、文化书籍，其中“向农民宣传总路线”一书，已印行二百多万册。人民美术出版社和朝花美术出版社，几年来出版的画册有一千六百余万册，图片有一亿零三百余万张。其中像连环画“鸡毛信”、“童工”，年画“毛主席和农民谈话”、“新娘子讲话”，政治宣传画“把学习成绩告诉志愿军叔叔”、“我们热爱和平”等，都成了广大群众喜爱的作品。“新娘子讲话”和“我们热爱和平”等，印行数字都在一百四十万份以上。
