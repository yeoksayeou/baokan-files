Several Experiences in Leading Private Professional Opera Troupes
Henan Provincial People's Government Cultural Bureau

Henan Province has 173 private professional opera troupes, encompassing nine types of opera, with approximately 8,700 performers and staff. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, they underwent political study, improved their ideological awareness, and carried out preliminary reforms of the troupe system. However, due to our insufficient study and implementation of the central government's policy on opera reform, there were serious chaotic phenomena in opera reform work, such as indiscriminate banning, indiscriminate modification, indiscriminate adaptation, and indiscriminate management. The National Opera Performance and Observation Meeting spurred us to examine past shortcomings and mistakes, making us realize how to follow the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" policy instructed by Chairman Mao to reform and develop national opera art; we have attached importance to and strengthened the leadership of the vast number of private professional opera troupes.

  I. Propagating and Implementing Opera Reform Policies
	The National Opera Performance and Observation Meeting told us that vigorously promoting and conscientiously implementing the central government's opera reform policy, and entrusting the policy to the masses, is the main key to doing a good job in drama work. Therefore, last year, we first summarized and inspected the province's drama work through the Provincial Cultural Administrative Conference, discussed and clarified the work guidelines and tasks for 1953, and, in conjunction with the rectification study of literary and art workers throughout the province, seriously examined and criticized the erroneous tendencies in the implementation of the opera reform policy. Secondly, we held training classes for opera work cadres and artists: 117 work cadres from various special districts, cities, counties, and key troupes were trained. Many special districts, cities, and key counties also held training classes for opera artists. Through training, the education of opera work cadres and artists on the opera reform policy was strengthened, the policy boundaries were initially clarified, and the shortcomings and errors in the work were exposed and examined. Through the exchange of experience and observation of performances, the ideological and professional levels were improved. In addition, through the handling of typical events, the policy was publicized and implemented: for example, the handling of the incident of Li Zhonggao, the head of the Cultural and Education Section of the former Xihua County, and others persecuting the artist Sang Zhenjun, launched a general discussion and examination, reversed the wrong views on the artists, educated the cadres, and also educated the vast number of artists. When the Party put forward the general task for the transition period, all localities organized artists to study under the leadership of the Party Committee and the cultural administrative departments. The socialist consciousness of the vast number of artists was raised, the future was clarified, the planned management of the troupes was strengthened, and the troupes were consolidated, bringing the work of the troupes onto a normal track.

  II. Introducing and Adapting Scripts
    In the early days of Henan's liberation, the reform of traditional repertoires was very insufficient; coupled with the serious practice of casually banning operas, the vast number of troupes had no operas to perform, which led to the phenomenon of "random adaptation" and "random performance." The masses and artists demanded good operas to perform, but the scripts we adapted and created fell far short of the needs of the masses. In order to solve this problem, we concentrated some drama workers and creative cadres, and invited old artists to participate, introduced the excellent scripts from the National Opera Performance and Observation Meeting, and slightly modified them to make them suitable for the performance of Henan local operas. In 1953, a total of 14 excellent repertoires were introduced, and 78,000 copies were printed and distributed. At the same time, the adaptation of old repertoires was strengthened, and a total of seven historical dramas and modern dramas were adapted, and 83,000 copies were printed and distributed. In the introduction and adaptation work, importance was attached to the scripts reflecting the modern people's lives, and scripts such as "Cannot Take That Road" and "Luo Han Qian" were adapted and printed and distributed. The printing and distribution of these more than 160,000 copies of scripts enabled the new repertoires to be widely staged throughout the province: for example, the Kaifeng Experimental Yu Opera Troupe performed 21 new operas last year, performing a total of 248 performances; the Luoyang May Opera Troupe performed 26 new operas throughout the year, performing a total of 217 performances. The performance of new operas was warmly welcomed by the audience. For example, the "Legend of the White Snake" performed by the Provincial People's Opera Troupe was performed for 48 consecutive days, and the Kaifeng Experimental Yu Opera Troupe's "Little Son-in-Law" was performed for more than 20 consecutive performances. The adapted performance of "Anti-Xuzhou" was even more welcomed by our most beloved people when it was performed to comfort the volunteers. The adaptation and general staging of "Cannot Take That Road" was closely integrated with the central work, and publicized the country's general task in the transition period. Through the rehearsal and performance of new operas, the performing arts of the actors were improved, the actors' enthusiasm for progress was encouraged, and the troupes were consolidated; at the same time, we gained a new understanding of how to inherit and sort out the national drama heritage. This shows that only by strengthening the supply of scripts and performing the operas well can we achieve audience satisfaction, actor improvement, and troupe consolidation.

  III. State-Owned Troupes Conduct Demonstration Performances
    We have strengthened the leadership of the Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, Drama Troupe, and People's Opera Troupe, and required them to strengthen policy and business learning, advocate hard study and hard practice, deeply experience life, and strive for artistic practice, and exert a demonstration role for private professional opera troupes through performances with considerable ideological and artistic qualities. Over the past year, the Provincial Drama Troupe has performed relatively successful operas such as "Dragon Beard Ditch," "In Front of New Things," and "Spring Breeze Blows to Nomin River." The Provincial Song and Dance Troupe and People's Opera Troupe have performed excellent scripts such as "Legend of the White Snake," "Liu Yin Ji," "Luo Han Qian," "Hunting Tigers," and "Volunteer's Fiancee" in constantly clarifying the direction of opera development and implementing the realistic performance methods. And in viewing, seminars, and counseling methods, exerted the demonstration role of state-owned troupes. One kind of observation is to organize opera work cadres and troupe main actors from various places to the province to observe the rehearsal and performance of state-owned troupes. Another way is for state-owned troupes to tour the province. According to incomplete statistics: Last year, more than 4,000 artists and opera work cadres watched the performances of the Provincial Song and Dance Troupe and People's Opera Troupe. During the tour, it was emphasized that "go there, learn there," and "go there, influence there." The cultural and educational departments in various places have also planned to organize observations: for example, Shangqiu has organized more than 200 cadres, main actors, and music staff from 22 troupes in the whole special district, some of whom even traveled more than 800 miles to observe the performance of the People's Opera Troupe. After each observation performance, a symposium was held, at which the main actors and music workers of the state-owned troupes were organized to introduce their experience in performance and music creation; during the tour, the state-owned troupes also sent directors and actors to provide practical and specific guidance and help to the private professional opera troupes, and many private professional opera troupes also sent people to the Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, the People's Opera Troupe, and the actors of the state-owned troupes to practice kung fu and study together; the relatively sound work system, work style, and serious and conscientious performance of the state-owned troupes naturally influenced the private professional opera troupes. A close fraternal friendship and connection has been established between the state-owned troupes and the private professional opera troupes, maintaining regular communication and counseling relationships. Under the influence of the state-owned troupes, the private professional opera troupes in various places have also staged new repertoires: for example, the Kaifeng Experimental Yu Opera Troupe and the Heping Opera Troupe have successively staged "Legend of the White Snake" and modern life-themed "Little Son-in-Law," "Marriage," and "Zhao Xiaolan," etc. The Nanyang Qu Opera Troupe arranged operas such as "Touring Turtle Mountain" and toured in the special district. These new operas were arranged under the cooperation of artists and new literary and art workers. They absorbed the successful experience of state-owned troupes, excavated the national drama heritage, and gradually improved the formalism in past performances with realistic performance methods. The actors have already had creation in understanding the role, such as the Kaifeng Experimental Yu Opera Troupe, when performing operas such as "Zhao Xiaolan," some of the main actors went to the countryside to experience life, so the performance effect was good, and there were improvements in performance, music, stage art and other aspects.

  IV. Establishing a Director Team for Key Counseling
    In order to deeply and specifically strengthen the guidance of private professional opera troupes, the Provincial Cultural Bureau has planned to promote the excellent programs and rehearsal experience of state-owned troupes, and transferred comrades with certain business ability from state-owned troupes to form a director team. After the director team conducted policy and business learning, they went deep into the key private professional opera troupes in groups to provide counseling, help the troupes to perform well, and further study the national heritage and understand the troupe situation through rehearsal work. The director team emphasized relying on artists (especially old artists) in their work, and "simultaneously modifying, simultaneously adapting, simultaneously reviewing, and simultaneously directing" with the artists. Constantly carry out socialist ideological education to the artists, oppose conservative ideas, and explain to the artists that "performing well" is a glorious task to serve national construction. On the basis of ideological education, deeply excavate the national opera heritage, create boldly, help them summarize the experience of artistic creation, and gradually establish a scientific rehearsal system. In the process of rehearsal, pay attention to cultivating backbones, so that they can take root and blossom in this group. In addition, the director team closely contacted the local People's Government wherever they went, obeyed the leadership of the local People's Government, and obtained the attention and guidance of the local leadership. In 1953, the director team helped the key private professional opera troupes rehearse operas such as "Liu Yin Ji," "Legend of the White Snake," "Xiao Er Hei Gets Married," "Zhang Yu Cooks the Sea," "Liu Hai Cuts Firewood," and "Autumn River," and the performance effect was good due to the more meticulous rehearsal. Through the in-depth guidance of the director team, the opera reform policy was specifically implemented, the troupes were helped to perform new operas of higher quality, the actors' performance level was improved, the actors' confidence in "performing well" was encouraged, and the nearby troupes were also influenced; the comrades of the director team also improved their business ability and investigated and understood the troupe situation through practical work. At present, the director team is welcomed everywhere, and various places have requested the province to send the director team. When the comrades of the director team left the troupe, the actors were reluctant to leave, and they had established a close friendship and connection with the artists.

    Many areas in Henan Province have attached importance to the counseling work of the performances of private professional opera troupes. For example, the Kaifeng Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education established an opera reform group to specifically counsel the performances of the troupes and help seven troupes, including the Experimental Yu Opera Troupe, rehearse 78 new operas, performing a total of 966 performances.

  V. Holding Small-Scale Observation Performances and Carrying Out Dramatic Criticism
      Small-scale observation performances, observation seminars, and carrying out drama reviews are effective methods for leading drama activities in a social way. At the end of last year, small-scale observation performances were held in several larger cities such as Kaifeng. In February this year, many counties and cities also held small-scale observation performances in conjunction with the Spring Festival cultural activities. One side is commercial performance, and the other side is observation and award, which is both economical and can play a role in exchanging experience. In March, the Provincial Cultural Bureau transferred the Anyang People's Opera Troupe and the Nanyang Qu Opera Troupe to Kaifeng to conduct small-scale observation performances with the Provincial Song and Dance Troupe and the Kaifeng Experimental Yu Opera Troupe, and organized other drama work cadres and private professional opera troupe artists to come to observe, and a symposium was held after the observation. During the symposium, the advantages of the four troupes' performances were discussed, and many actors said at the meeting that they were willing to learn humbly. Through observation and seminars, the policy was implemented, experience was exchanged, the actors' enthusiasm for progress was encouraged, and unity was strengthened. In addition, various places have also convened observation seminars, convened by the cultural authorities, inviting actors, opera work cadres and propaganda and education department comrades to participate. The content of the symposium mainly focused on encouraging creation, giving appropriate criticism to shortcomings, and putting forward constructive opinions. Through observation seminars, drama review work was carried out. Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other places have organized review committees and organized commentary articles.

    Over the past year, through the above work, the chaotic phenomena in opera work have been basically overcome, and the drama work has been brought into a normal track. But this is just the beginning, and there are still many shortcomings in the work. First of all, the systematic grasp of the situation of the vast number of private professional opera troupes is not enough, and there is a lack of detailed investigation and research; the experience is not summarized in time, and specific guidance is not given. Secondly, the leadership of regular political learning for the vast number of artists is still very poor, especially in how to improve their socialist ideological consciousness, we do not have a deep understanding; in helping actors summarize artistic creation, we have not done enough. Some of the adaptation work of some scripts is not serious and responsible enough, and some scripts are of poor quality and cannot be widely promoted. The review work is not frequent enough. We must continue to work hard, according to the requirements of the general task of the transition period, reform and develop national drama art, strengthen the leadership and management of private professional opera troupes, and better serve the great socialist construction.

    领导民间职业剧团的几点经验
    河南省人民政府文化局
    河南省有民间职业剧团一百七十三个，包括九个剧种，演职员约有八千七百多人。解放后他们在党和政府的正确领导下，进行了政治学习，提高了思想觉悟，对剧团的制度进行了初步改革。但由于我们对中央的戏曲改革方针学习和贯彻不够，因而戏曲改革工作中存在着严重的乱禁、乱改、乱编、乱管等混乱现象。全国戏曲观摩会演，鞭策着我们检查了过去的缺点和错误，使我们认识到应如何遵循毛主席所指示的：“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针来改革和发展民族戏曲艺术；重视并加强了对广大民间职业剧团的领导。
  一、宣传和贯彻戏曲改革政策
      全国戏曲观摩会演告诉我们：大力宣传和认真贯彻中央的戏曲改革政策、把政策交给群众，是做好戏剧工作的主要关键。因此，在去年首先通过省文化行政会议，总结和检查了全省戏剧工作，讨论并明确了一九五三年的工作方针和任务，并结合全省文艺工作者的整风学习，严肃地检查和批判了执行戏曲改革政策上的错误倾向。其次举办了戏曲工作干部与艺人训练班：训练了各专区、市、县及重点剧团工作干部一百十七人，许多专区、市和重点县也都举办了戏曲艺人训练班。通过训练，加强了戏曲工作干部和艺人对于戏曲改革政策的教育，初步划清了政策界限，揭发和检查了工作中的缺点和错误，通过交流经验，观摩演出，提高了思想和业务水平。另外通过典型事件的处理，宣传和贯彻政策：如对前西华县文教科科长李中皋等迫害艺人桑振君事件的处理，开展了普遍的讨论和检查，扭转了对艺人的错误看法，教育了干部，也教育了广大艺人。当党提出过渡时期总任务时，各地在党委和文化行政部门领导下，都组织艺人进行了学习。提高了广大艺人的社会主义觉悟，明确了前途，加强了剧团的计划管理，巩固了剧团。使剧团工作纳入了正常轨道。
  二、介绍和改编剧本
    河南解放初期，对传统剧目的改革作得非常不够；加以严重的随便禁戏的做法，使广大剧团无戏可演，就产生“乱编”、“乱改”和“乱演”的现象。群众和艺人要求有好戏演，而我们改编和创作的剧本远远赶不上群众的要求。为了解决这个问题，我们集中了一些戏剧工作者和创作干部，并邀请了老艺人参加，介绍了全国戏曲会演的优秀剧本，稍加修改，使其适合河南地方戏的演出。一九五三年共介绍优秀剧目十四出，印发七万八千册。同时也加强了对旧有剧目的改编工作，共改编历史剧与现代剧七本，印发八万三千册。并在介绍和改编工作中重视了反映现代人民生活的剧本，改编并印发了“不能走那一条路”和“罗汉钱”等剧本。这十六万余册剧本的印发，使全省各地普遍上演了新的剧目：如开封实验豫剧团去年演出新戏二十一出，共演二百四十八场，洛阳五月剧团全年演出新戏二十六出，共演二百一十七场。新戏的上演，受到了观众的热烈欢迎，如省人民剧团演出的“白蛇传”，连演四十八天，开封实验豫剧团的“小女婿”连演二十余场，经过改编的“反徐州”的演出，在慰问志愿军时，更受到我们最可爱的人的欢迎。“不能走那一条路”的改编与普遍上演，紧密地结合了中心工作，宣传了国家在过渡时期的总任务。通过新戏的排演，提高了演员的表演艺术，鼓舞了演员的上进心，巩固了剧团；同时使我们对如何继承和整理民族戏剧遗产有了新的认识。这都说明只有加强剧本供应，把戏演好才能做到观众满意，演员提高，剧团巩固。
  三、国营剧团进行示范演出
    我们加强了对省歌剧团、话剧团和人民剧团的领导，要求他们加强政策和业务学习，提倡苦学苦练，深入体验生活，努力艺术实践，通过具有相当思想性和艺术性的演出，发挥对民间职业剧团的示范作用。省话剧团一年来演出了“龙须沟”、“在新事物面前”和“春风吹到诺敏河”等较为成功的戏。省歌剧团、人民剧团在不断地明确了歌剧发展方向与贯彻了现实主义的表演方法中，演出了“白蛇传”、“柳荫记”、“罗汉钱”、“猎虎记”、
  “志愿军的未婚妻”等优秀的剧本。并以观摩、座谈和辅导等方法，发挥了国营剧团的示范作用。一种观摩的办法是组织各地戏曲工作干部和剧团主要演员来省观摩国营剧团的排演和演出。另一种办法是国营剧团分头在全省各地巡回演出。据不完全统计：去年曾观摩过省歌剧团和人民剧团演出的艺人和戏曲工作干部达四千多人。在巡回演出中强调
  “走到那里，学到那里”、“走到那里，影响到那里”。各地文教部门也都有计划地组织了观摩：如商邱曾组织全专区二十二个剧团的干部、主要演员和音乐工作人员等共二百余人，其中甚至有往返八百余里来观摩人民剧团的演出的。每次观摩演出后都举行了座谈会，在座谈会上组织国营剧团的主要演员和音乐工作者介绍演出和音乐创造等方面的经验；巡回演出期中，国营剧团并派导演和演员对民间职业剧团作实际、具体的辅导和帮助，不少民间职业剧团也派人到省歌剧团、人民剧团和国营剧团的演员们一同练功、一同学习；国营剧团的比较健全的工作制度，工作作风和严肃认真的表演等等，便自然地影响了民间职业剧团。国营剧团和民间职业剧团间已建立了亲密的兄弟般的友谊和联系，保持着经常的通讯和辅导关系。在国营剧团的影响下，各地民间职业剧团也纷纷上演了新的剧目：如开封实验豫剧团、和平剧团先后上演了“白蛇传”及表现现代生活的“小女婿”、“结婚”和“赵小兰”等。南阳曲剧团排出了“游龟山”等戏，并在专区进行了巡回演出。这些新戏都是在艺人和新文艺工作者的合作下排出的。他们吸收国营剧团成功经验，挖掘民族戏剧遗产，并以现实主义表演方法在逐步改进已往表演中的形式主义部分。演员在体会角色上已经有了创造，如开封实验豫剧团，在演出“赵小兰”等戏时，有些主要演员曾到农村去体验生活，因而使演出效果良好，在表演、音乐、舞台美术等各方面都有改进。四、成立导演组重点辅导
    为了深入、具体地加强对民间职业剧团的辅导，省文化局有计划地推广国营剧团演出的优秀节目和排演经验，抽调了国营剧团有一定业务能力的同志，组成了导演组。导演组在进行了政策和业务学习后，分组深入重点民间职业剧团进行辅导，帮助剧团把戏演好，通过排演工作进一步学习民族遗产和了解剧团情况。导演组在工作中强调依靠艺人（特别是老艺人），与艺人“同改、同编、同审、同导”。不断地向艺人进行社会主义思想教育，反对保守思想，向艺人说明：“把戏演好”是为国家建设服务的光荣任务。在思想教育的基础上深入挖掘民族戏曲遗产，大胆创造，帮助他们总结艺术创造的经验，逐步建立科学的排演制度。在排演过程中，注意培养了骨干，使他们在本团生根开花。另外，导演组每到一地，都和当地人民政府紧密联系，服从当地人民政府领导，取得当地领导上的重视和指导。一九五三年中，导演组帮助重点民间职业剧团排演了“柳荫记”、“白蛇传”、“小二黑结婚”、“张羽煮海”、“刘海砍樵”和“秋江”等戏，由于通过较为细致的排练，演出效果良好。通过导演组的深入辅导，具体地贯彻了戏曲改革政策，帮助剧团演出了质量较高的新戏，提高了演员的表演水平，鼓舞了演员“把戏演好”的信心，也影响了附近的剧团；导演组同志通过实际工作的锻炼，也提高了业务能力，调查了解了剧团情况。目前导演组到处受到欢迎，各地纷纷要求省里派导演组去。当导演组同志离开剧团时，演员们恋恋不舍，他们和艺人间已建立了亲密的友谊和联系。
    河南省许多地区都重视了对民间职业剧团演出的辅导工作，如开封市文教局成立了戏曲改革组，具体辅导剧团的演出，帮助实验豫剧团等七个剧团排演了新戏七十八出，共演九百六十六场。
  五、举行小型观摩演出，开展
        戏剧批评小型观摩演出、观摩座谈会和开展戏剧评介，是以社会方式领导戏剧活动的有效方法。去年年底，开封等几个较大的城市举办了小型观摩演出，今年二月，许多县、市结合春节文艺活动，也举办了小型观摩演出。一面营业演出，一面观摩评奖，既节约，又能起到交流经验的作用。省文化局在三月里调安阳人民剧社和南阳曲剧团到开封来，和省歌剧团、开封实验豫剧团作小型观摩演出，并组织了其他戏剧工作干部和民间职业剧团艺人前来观摩，观摩后进行了座谈。座谈中漫谈了四团演出的优点，许多演员在会上都表示愿意虚心学习。通过观摩、座谈，贯彻了政策，交流了经验，鼓舞了演员的上进心，增强了团结。另外各地也曾召开了观摩座谈会，由文化主管部门召集，邀请演员、戏曲工作干部和宣教部门同志参加，座谈内容以鼓励创作为主，对缺点给予恰当的批评，并提出建设性的意见。通过观摩座谈，开展了戏剧评介工作，开封、郑州等地都曾组织过评介委员会，组织评论文章。
      一年来，通过以上工作，基本上克服了戏曲工作中的混乱现象，使戏剧工作步入正常轨道。但这仅仅是开始，同时工作中也还存在着不少缺点。首先，对广大民间职业剧团的情况系统掌握的不够，缺乏详细的调查研究；没有及时的总结经验，具体进行指导。其次，对广大艺人经常的政治学习的领导还作得很差，特别是在如何提高其社会主义思想觉悟方面，我们体会不深；在帮助演员总结艺术创造上也还做得非常不够。有些剧本的改编工作，还不够严肃认真，有些剧本质量差，不能大量推广。评介工作也不够经常。我们还须继续努力，根据过渡时期总任务的要求，改革和发展民族戏剧艺术，加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理，更好的为伟大的社会主义建设服务。
