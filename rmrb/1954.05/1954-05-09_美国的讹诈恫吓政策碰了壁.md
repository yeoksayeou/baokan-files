America's Policy of Blackmail and Intimidation Runs into a Wall
Hesheng

A month ago, when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles clamored for "united action" to deal with the Indochinese people's struggle for independence, U.S. President Eisenhower immediately expressed "complete agreement"; then, U.S. Vice President Nixon also clamored that the United States would send troops to directly participate in the Indochina War. However, according to a United States Information Service dispatch from Washington on April 29, Eisenhower said: The United States will not participate in the Indochina War and indicated that a practical way of coexisting in Indochina could be found. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on April 28, Nixon also said that the Eisenhower administration's main goal was "not to send American soldiers to fight in Indochina or anywhere else in the world."

What caused Eisenhower to say that a practical way of coexisting in Indochina could be found? Let us look at the reactions after the United States proposed the "united action" plan: "Dulles originally hoped to gain support for his united action plan, but he has been disappointed," "America's European allies appear very silent on this issue" (Agence France-Presse). U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford also "failed to persuade Britain to take action immediately with the United States" (United Press). In France, "whether in parliament, the government, or public opinion, most people do not approve of internationalizing this war (referring to the Indochina War)" (French "Volunteer Daily"). Asian public opinion also believes that the "united action" being planned by the United States is another American "playing with fire" and called for "Asian countries must resist American intimidation and threats" ("Indonesia News"). The American "united action" plan has fallen into a situation of being besieged on all sides. British Member of Parliament Crossman said a few days ago: "'United action' has always been a huge intimidation." Obviously, this policy of blackmail and intimidation has run into a wall, therefore, Eisenhower had to adopt such a statement, attempting to ease the opposition to the U.S.'s "united action" plan.

At the Geneva Conference, the failure of America's blackmail and intimidation policy became even more obvious. An Associated Press dispatch from Geneva on May 1 admitted: America's "strength and firm policy" did not receive support from Britain and France. A United Press dispatch from New York on May 1 also said: "Today at the Geneva Conference, there is no one more isolated than Uncle Sam." An issue of the American "Stone Weekly" published on April 5, commenting on the nature of the American "united action" blackmail and intimidation, pointed out: "Only those who mistake recklessness for strength will think that Dulles has adopted a strong attitude. His attitude actually reflects the Eisenhower administration's weakness." Now, Eisenhower's talk of seeking a "practical way" and the United States' isolation at the Geneva Conference have further exposed this "weakness."

However, anyone who thinks that Eisenhower's talk of seeking a "practical way" means a change in American policy would be wrong. According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on May 4: Eisenhower has guaranteed to France: "America's attitude toward the Indochina issue has not changed," and the talk of the U.S. policy seeking a temporary agreement should not be interpreted as a "concession" from Washington. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on May 4, Eisenhower also guaranteed to Dulles: He fully supports taking "concerted action" to support France's continued war of aggression in Indochina. On May 6, Eisenhower publicly stated at a press conference in Washington that the so-called "collective security" organization in Southeast Asia "is being established." And Dulles, before leaving Geneva to return home, was also clamoring that he "will continue to promote" the so-called "collective security" organization in Southeast Asia. It can be seen that although America's blackmail and intimidation policy has run into a wall, Eisenhower and Dulles and their ilk have not learned a lesson from this. The United States is still attempting to use "united action" to expand the Indochina War. This must be guarded against!

    美国的讹诈恫吓政策碰了壁
    禾生
    一个月以前，当美国国务卿杜勒斯叫嚣要用“联合行动”来对付印度支那人民争取独立的斗争时，美国总统艾森豪威尔立刻表示“完全同意”；接着，美国副总统尼克松也叫嚣美国将派遣军队直接参加印度支那战争。可是，据美国新闻处华盛顿四月二十九日电讯报道，艾森豪威尔说：美国将不参加印度支那战争，并表示可找出在印度支那彼此相处的某种切实可行的办法。另据合众社华盛顿四月二十八日电讯报道，尼克松也说艾森豪威尔政府的主要目标是“不派遣美国兵到印度支那或世界任何其他地方去作战”。
    是什么原因使艾森豪威尔又说可以在印度支那找出一个彼此相处的切实可行的办法呢？且让我们来看看美国提出“联合行动”计划后的反应吧：“杜勒斯原先希望获得对他的联合行动计划的支持，但是他已失望”，“美国的欧洲盟国在这个问题上显得非常沉默”（法新社）。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福也“未能说服英国立刻和美国一起采取行动”（合众社）。在法国，“无论是在议会中，政府中，或者舆论方面，大多数人都不赞成把这个战争（指印度支那战争）国际化”（法国“义勇军报”）。而亚洲的舆论也认为美国策划中的“联合行动”是美国又一次的“玩火”行为，并呼吁“亚洲国家必须反抗美国的恫吓威胁”（“印尼新闻报”）。美国的“联合行动”计划，陷入了四面楚歌的形势中。英国下院议员克罗斯曼前几天说：“‘联合行动’一直是一种巨大的恐吓。”很显然，这种讹诈恫吓的政策碰了壁，因此，艾森豪威尔不得不采取这样一种说法，企图来缓和一下美国的“联合行动”计划所遭到的反对。
    在日内瓦会议上，美国的讹诈恫吓政策的失败更加明显。美联社日内瓦五月一日电讯承认：美国的“实力和坚定的政策”没有获得英国和法国的支持。合众社纽约五月一日电讯也说：“今天在日内瓦会议上再没有比山姆大叔更孤立的人物了。”四月五日出版的一期美国“斯通周刊”在评论美国
  “联合行动”的讹诈恫吓的性质时曾指出：“只有那些把蛮干误认为力量的人，才会认为杜勒斯采取了一个强有力的态度。他的态度实际是反映了艾森豪威尔政府的虚弱。”现在，艾森豪威尔的寻求“切实可行的办法”的说法和美国在日内瓦会议上的孤立，使这种“虚弱”更加暴露了。
    然而，谁要认为艾森豪威尔的寻求“切实可行的办法”的说法是意味着美国政策的改变，那就错了。据合众社巴黎五月四日电讯透露：艾森豪威尔已向法国担保：“美国对印度支那问题的态度始终未变”，美国政策寻求暂时协议的说法，不能解释为华盛顿的“让步”。另据法新社华盛顿五月四日电讯透露：艾森豪威尔也向杜勒斯担保：他完全赞成采取“一致行动”来支持法国继续进行侵略印度支那战争。五月六日，艾森豪威尔在华盛顿记者招待会上公开地说：所谓东南亚的“集体安全”组织“正在建立中”。而杜勒斯在离开日内瓦返国前，也在叫嚣“将继续促进”所谓东南亚的“集体安全”组织。可以看出：美国的讹诈恫吓政策虽然碰了壁，可是艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流并没有从这里得到教训，美国仍然企图用“联合行动”来扩大印度支那战争。这是必须加以警惕的！
