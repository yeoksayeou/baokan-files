(Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 6th) TASS Geneva, May 5th: Participants in the Geneva Conference did not hold a meeting on the 5th, and no plenary session will be held on the 6th. The participants in the meeting are using these two days without meetings to conduct informal contacts in order to bring their views closer together.

    Some Swiss newspapers link the interruption of the meeting with the fact that an agreement has been reached on the issue of the members participating in the discussion on the Indochina issue, namely that in addition to the five major powers and the so-called three members of the Indochina Federation, representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should also be present. The newspapers believe that reaching this agreement is a defeat for Dulles' policy, which aimed to have the Geneva Conference decide the fate of Indochina without the participation of representatives of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The "Swiss Newspaper" pointed out: "Even American observers who are sympathetic to Dulles cannot conceal the isolation of the US Secretary of State," and his isolation is "due to differences between him and Bidault and Eden on how to proceed with the discussion of the Indochina issue."

    Now the newspapers are paying close attention to the situation of the French delegation headed by Bidault. The newspapers point out that this delegation is in a dilemma. On the one hand, Bidault is under increasing pressure from the United States. According to the "Swiss Newspaper", "Lausanne Daily" and other newspapers, the new pressure from the United States on the French delegation is: before leaving Geneva, Dulles gave Bidault a personal letter and sent a copy of Eisenhower's telegram to Dulles to the head of the French delegation. According to the newspapers, the above-mentioned letter and telegram pointed out that the US's "tough" policy on the Indochina issue remains unchanged, and Dulles demanded that Bidault support this policy. The "Lausanne Daily" wrote: "The letter and telegram that Dulles gave to Bidault before leaving Geneva are simply like an ultimatum." This letter shows that the United States' stubborn attitude has not changed, and the United States still wants to interfere in Indochina.

    The newspapers pointed out: On the other hand, Bidault in Geneva cannot ignore the extreme dissatisfaction of the French public with succumbing to the US policy. This dissatisfaction is manifested in the remarks of people from all walks of life in Paris and in the fact that many members of the French Parliament demanded an immediate discussion of the Indochina issue. Local newspapers enthusiastically commented on the news that French government leader Laniel requested an indefinite postponement of the debate on the Indochina issue and proposed a vote of confidence in the government for this purpose. The "Lausanne Daily" wrote that the very existence of the French government has become a problem, and this fact will affect the negotiations in Geneva and Bidault's position.

    The newspapers also talked about the possibility of Bidault immediately returning to Paris. They pointed out that Bidault would decide whether to temporarily return to the country to participate in the National Assembly meeting held on the 6th after his office director, Falaise, returned from Paris to report on the political situation in Paris. However, it was learned here on the 5th that Bidault would not return to the country to participate in the National Assembly meeting held on the 6th. According to existing information, Bidault followed Laniel's advice and stayed in Geneva.

    美国向法国代表团施加压力
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦五日讯：日内瓦会议的参加者在五日没有举行会议，六日也不举行全体会议。会议的参加者利用这两天不开会的时间进行非正式的接触，以使彼此的观点得以接近。
    某些瑞士报纸把会议的中断和下一事实联系在一起，就是参加会议关于印度支那问题的讨论的成员问题已达成协议，参加会议的除五大国和所谓印度支那三个联邦成员国外，还应有越南民主共和国的代表。报纸都认为达成这一协议是杜勒斯的政策的失败，杜勒斯的政策是想使日内瓦会议在没有越南民主共和国政府代表的参加下决定印度支那的命运。“瑞士报”指出：“即使是对杜勒斯有好感的美国观察家，也无法掩盖美国国务卿的孤立”，而他之所以孤立就是“由于在如何着手讨论印度支那问题上，他和皮杜尔及艾登间有分歧。”
    现在各报都很注意以皮杜尔为首的法国代表团的处境。报纸指出，这个代表团是处于左右为难的境地。一方面，皮杜尔正受着美国愈来愈强的压力。据“瑞士报”、“洛桑日报”和其他报纸说，美国对法国代表团的新的压力是：杜勒斯在离开日内瓦前给了皮杜尔一封私人信，并把艾森豪威尔给杜勒斯的电报的副本送交法国代表团团长。据报纸说，上述书信和电报指出：美国在印度支那问题上的“强硬”政策仍然不变，杜勒斯要求皮杜尔支持这一政策。“洛桑日报”写道：“杜勒斯在离开日内瓦前交给皮杜尔的书信和电报，简直就像是最后通牒。”这封信表明美国的顽固态度仍然没有改变，美国仍要干涉印度支那。
    各报指出：另一方面，在日内瓦的皮杜尔又不能忽视法国公众对于屈从美国的政策的极端不满。这种不满表现在巴黎各界人士的言论中，表现在法国议会的许多议员们要求立即讨论印度支那问题这一事实上。各地报纸热烈评论着这个消息：法国政府领袖拉尼埃要求不定期地延期辩论印度支那问题，并为此提出了对政府的信任投票问题。“洛桑日报”写道，法国政府本身的存在成了问题，这一事实将影响日内瓦的协商和皮杜尔的立场。
    各报还谈到皮杜尔立刻回巴黎的可能性，它们指出：皮杜尔等自己的办公厅主任法莱什从巴黎回来把巴黎的政治情况向他报告后，就将决定是否暂时回国参加在六日举行的国民议会会议。但是此间在五日获悉，皮杜尔将不返国参加六日举行的国民议会会议了。据现有的消息说，皮杜尔听从了拉尼埃的劝告留在日内瓦。
