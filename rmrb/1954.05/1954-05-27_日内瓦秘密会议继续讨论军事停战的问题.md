Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 25th: The delegations of the nine countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue held a restricted meeting on the afternoon of the 25th and issued the following communique:

"At the restricted meeting on May 25th, the nine delegations continued to consider the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The next restricted meeting on this issue will be held on May 27th."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 25th: Special correspondent reports: Sources here say that at the secret meeting of the nine delegations on restoring peace in Indochina held on the 25th, various issues related to a military ceasefire were discussed. Pham Van Dong, Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressed his hope that hostilities could be completely, simultaneously, and as quickly as possible halted in Indochina. He believes that in order to ensure the realization and consolidation of the ceasefire, it is essential to delineate the areas of concentration for both sides' forces and to carry out regional adjustments.

British Foreign Secretary Eden proposed at the meeting that, in order to promote a swift cessation of hostilities, it is necessary to stipulate the areas of concentration for both sides' forces. Military representatives from both sides should meet immediately in Geneva, and their first task should be to demarcate concentration areas in Vietnam, and they should report the results and recommendations of their discussions to the conference as soon as possible. In the meantime, the conference procedure should move on to discussing other military matters, first discussing arrangements for international supervision.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out that the main point of the British proposal was to suggest direct contact between the military authorities of both sides. This was the proposition put forward by the Soviet delegation at the previous meeting. Molotov also suggested that the British proposal be amended to say that the cessation of hostilities should not only be "swift" but also "simultaneous"; that the meeting of military representatives of both sides in Geneva should facilitate direct contact between the military authorities of both sides in Indochina; and that the first task of the meeting of military representatives of both sides in Geneva should be to demarcate concentration areas for both sides, first for Vietnam. Molotov also believes that the working procedures of the conference during this period do not need to be included in the proposal.

During the discussion, the representatives of the United States and France did not agree to the simultaneous cessation of hostilities. They advocated the cessation of hostilities first in Cambodia and Laos. The representatives of France and the United States also supported the views of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the representatives of Bao Dai, believing that there was no issue of demarcating the concentration areas of the forces of both sides in Cambodia and Laos. After the cessation of hostilities there, there was only the issue of the so-called "Viet Minh troops withdrawing." They even believed that "military representatives from both sides" only applied to Vietnam, and there were no "two sides" in Cambodia and Laos. The opinions expressed by these representatives show that they are still trying to fundamentally obliterate the resistance forces of Cambodia and Laos. The representatives of the United States and France also insisted on disarming the local forces of the peoples of the three Indochinese countries. Due to the insistence of these representatives on these unreasonable demands, the meeting failed to reach an agreement.

### 日内瓦秘密会议继续讨论军事停战的问题

    日内瓦秘密会议继续讨论军事停战的问题
   【新华社日内瓦二十五日电】参加日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题讨论的九个国家的代表团二十五日下午举行了限制性的会议后发表公报如下：
    “在五月二十五日的限制性会议中，九国代表团继续考虑恢复印度支那和平的问题。下次关于这一问题的限制性会议将在五月二十七日举行。”
    【新华社日内瓦二十五日电】本社特派记者报道：此间获得的消息说，在二十五日举行的关于恢复印度支那和平的九国代表团的秘密会议上，讨论了有关军事停战的各项问题。越南民主共和国代表团范文同代理外长希望能在印度支那完全地、同时地、并尽可能迅速地停止敌对行动，他认为为保证停火的实现和停战的巩固，划定双方军队的集结地区和进行地区调整是十分必要的。
    英国外交大臣艾登在会上提出一项建议，即：为了促进迅速停止敌对行为，有必要规定双方军队集结的地区。双方军方代表即刻在日内瓦会晤，他们的第一个任务是对越南划出集结地区，并应尽速向会议报告讨论的结果和建议。在此期间，会议程序应进入其他军事事项的商讨，首先商讨关于国际监督的安排。
    苏联外长莫洛托夫指出，英国建议的主要点是建议双方军事当局的直接接触。而这是苏联代表团在前次会议中所提出的主张。莫洛托夫并建议对英国的建议加以修改，即：停止敌对行动不仅应“迅速”，而且要“同时”；双方军方代表在日内瓦会晤应促成印度支那当地双方军方的直接接触；双方军方代表在日内瓦会晤的第一个任务应是对双方，首先对越南划出集结地区。莫洛托夫还认为，在此期间会议的工作程序不必列入建议中。
    在讨论过程中，美国和法国的代表不赞成同时停止敌对行动，他们主张首先在高棉和寮国停止敌对行动。法国和美国的代表还支持高棉王国和保大代表的意见，认为在高棉和寮国不发生划定双方军队集结地区的问题，那里在停止敌对行动之后只有所谓“越盟军队撤离”的问题。他们甚至认为“双方军方”只对越南适用，而在高棉和寮国并无“双方”。这些代表们发表的意见表明，他们依然企图根本抹煞高棉和寮国的抗战军队。美国和法国的代表还坚持要解除印度支那三国人民的地方部队的武装。由于这些代表坚持这些无理主张，会议没有达成协议。
