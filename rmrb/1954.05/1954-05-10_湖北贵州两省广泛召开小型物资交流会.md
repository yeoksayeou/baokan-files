    Small-Scale Material Exchange Meetings Widely Held in Hubei and Guizhou Provinces
    Since March, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Hubei Province have been holding small-scale spring material exchange meetings in vast rural primary markets. More than twenty counties in the Huanggang, Xiangfan, and Jingzhou Special Districts have held material exchange meetings, and there are six or seven locations in counties such as Echeng and Xinzhou that have held material exchange meetings, with twelve locations in Xishui County.
    Through small-scale material exchange meetings, various localities have supplied farmers with a large amount of means of production and means of livelihood. At the material exchange meetings held in various market towns in Hanchuan County, sales of means of production increased by more than double compared to normal times. The material exchange meetings in Yangluo, Jiujie, and Zhangdian in Xinzhou County saw transactions worth over 6.5 billion yuan, of which means of production accounted for 72.5 percent, including more than 300 head of draft cattle, more than 100 waterwheels, 200 plows, 4 million catties of oil cake, and a large number of other fertilizers and pesticides. The material exchange meetings also purchased a batch of local and special products from farmers. At the Chengguan material exchange meeting in Daye County, local and special products worth over 222 million yuan were purchased from farmers, accounting for 21.93 percent of the total purchase and sales amount of the meeting. Before the Chengguan Cooperative in Xinzhou County held a material exchange meeting locally, it only purchased an average of 2,000 catties of cottonseed and 300 catties of cotton per day; at the material exchange meeting, it purchased 1,700 catties of cotton and 15,000 catties of cottonseed in two days. The turnover of private industrial and commercial enterprises also increased. At the Duanjiadian material exchange meeting in Echeng County, the turnover of private department stores increased by an average of 78.5 percent compared to normal times, and the turnover of textile businesses increased by 151 percent.

    During the spring plowing production period, small-scale material exchange meetings were widely held in various parts of Guizhou Province. Thirty-four counties, including Chishui, have held 200 such material exchange meetings, with a transaction volume of hundreds of billions of yuan.
    Before holding small-scale material exchange meetings, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives generally cooperated with rural cadres to investigate the needs of farmers and fully prepared materials. Farmers in Yinbao Township, Suiyang County, bought 11 head of draft cattle, 300 plowshares, and a batch of other farm tools and seeds at the exchange meeting, solving the spring plowing difficulties of more than 300 households. Chishui County's Second District is a sugar-producing area. Some time ago, due to insufficient market activity, the cooperative's purchase of sugar was not large, but at the material exchange meeting, more than 13,000 catties of brown sugar were traded in one day.
    In order to mutually regulate materials, the Zunyi Special District also held internal material exchange meetings between state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives, trading more than 10,000 pieces of agricultural implements, more than 10,000 catties of steel, 100 waterwheels, 120 tons of phosphate fertilizer, and a batch of other materials. At the internal material exchange meeting held by state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in the Anshun Special District, the transaction volume reached 9.8 billion yuan. (Wang Wanjun)

    湖北贵州两省广泛召开小型物资交流会
    湖北省国营商业部门和合作社从三月份开始在广大农村初级市场召开了小型春季物资交流会。黄冈、襄樊、荆州等专区已有二十多个县举行了物资交流会，鄂城、新洲等县举行物资交流会的地区都有六、七处，浠水县有十二处。
    各地通过小型物资交流会，供应给农民大批生产资料和生活资料。汉川县各集镇召开的物资交流会上，生产资料销售量比平时增加一倍以上。新洲县阳逻、旧街、张店等地的物资交流会，成交物品值六十五亿余元，其中生产资料占百分之七十二点五，计有耕牛三百多头，水车一百多乘，犁二百具，油饼四百万斤，以及大批其他的肥料和农药等。物资交流会上也收购了农民一批土产和特产品。大冶县城关物资交流会上，收购农民的土特产品值二亿二千余万元，占大会购销总额的百分之二十一点九三。新洲县城关合作社在当地举行物资交流会以前，平均每天只收购棉籽二千斤、棉花三百斤；在物资交流会上，两天就收购棉花一千七百斤、棉籽一万五千斤。私营工商业的营业额也有增加。鄂城县段家店物资交流会上，私营百货业营业额比平时平均上升百分之七十八点五，布匹业上升百分之一百五十一。　（张成信　张声玉）

    在春耕生产期间，贵州省各地广泛举行了小型物资交流会。赤水等三十四个县已举行这种物资交流会二百次，成交额达数百亿元。
    各地在举行小型物资交流会以前，国营商业部门和合作社一般都配合乡村干部调查了农民的需要，充分准备了物资。绥阳县银堡乡农民在交流会上买到十一头耕牛、三百件铧口，以及一批其他的农具和种籽，解决了三百多户农民的春耕困难。赤水县第二区是产糖区，前些日子因为市场不够活跃，合作社收购的糖数量不大，但在物资交流会上，一天就成交红糖一万三千多斤。
    为了互相调剂物资，遵义专区还举行了国营商业和合作社内部的物资交流会，成交农具一万多件、钢铁一万多斤、水车一百部、磷肥一百二十吨，以及一批其他的物资。安顺专区国营商业部门和合作社举行的内部物资交流会上，成交额达九十八亿元。　　（王万钧）
