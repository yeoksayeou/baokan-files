In recent years, due to the implementation of the correct policy of opera reform, the profound influence of various social democratic reform movements, and the raising of the political consciousness of the vast number of performers, significant changes have taken place in private professional theatrical troupes nationwide. The repertoire and stage images have been innovated, and the internal relationships of the troupes have been altered. Apart from a small number of troupes still operated by owners and a portion of mobile troupes with fluctuating membership, most troupes have become "republican-style" troupes managed and operated by the performers themselves. These troupes have transformed from performers being employed by owners to performers cooperating in management, from a fixed salary system to a system of remuneration based on labor. Some troupes have even begun to accumulate public property (such as costume trunks, sets, lighting, etc.). The leadership of the troupes has begun to adopt democratic methods. This change has not only fundamentally eliminated the exploitative relationships within the troupes but also raised the political consciousness and sense of responsibility of the performers, enhancing their work enthusiasm and creativity, which provides favorable conditions for the improvement and enhancement of opera art.

However, at present, the development of these "republican-style" troupes is very uneven across various regions, and the situations are not entirely the same. A small number of troupes have relatively sound organizations, and their political and artistic levels are also relatively high. Most troupes have only initially implemented cooperative management, and their internal structures are not yet sound or stable, with many serious problems and shortcomings. First, the old system has been abolished or is being abolished, but a new system has not been well established for the time being, and some new systems are not entirely reasonable or have become mere formalities. Although performers have made significant progress politically, they still retain many old ideological styles, resulting in patriarchal work styles or tendencies towards extreme democratization. In terms of economic treatment, there are unfair distribution or egalitarianism, resulting in lax labor discipline, a lack of long-term planning, and unwillingness to accumulate public reserve funds or purchase public property. More importantly, business operations have not been improved and enhanced, and therefore cannot meet the needs of the broad masses of the audience. While there are objective, social, and historical reasons for the emergence of the above shortcomings, a crucial reason is the lack of regular leadership and specific assistance from cultural administrative departments at all levels for private professional theatrical troupes.

Private professional theatrical troupes are a vast force for artistic propaganda. To fully exert their positive role, cultural administrative departments at all levels must further strengthen leadership and management, and specific instructions are hereby given as follows:

I. For "republican-style" troupes, concrete and appropriate steps should be taken according to different situations to enlighten the performers' self-awareness and willingness, and actively help and encourage them to strive in the following aspects to gradually improve their political quality and artistic level.

(1) Stage excellent repertoire (including reorganized and adapted original scripts and newly created scripts), and formulate performance plans on a regular basis. Strive for improvement in stage art, continue to eliminate ugly images, and at the same time oppose the commercial tendency of catering to backward tastes with vulgar performances or unilaterally pursuing novel costumes and scenery. Gradually establish a strict rehearsal system.

(2) Establish a sharing or wage system that basically conforms to the principle of remuneration based on labor, gradually reform unreasonable economic systems, and implement economic openness and democratic supervision. Strengthen labor discipline and oppose egalitarianism. On the basis of gradually improving the quality of performances to increase income and improve living conditions, accumulate public reserve funds and purchase public property, and set up bonus and welfare funds.

(3) Establish democratic leadership, improve organizational structures, strengthen close cooperation and unity among actors, and between actors and directors, musicians, and staff, and oppose patriarchal work styles and tendencies towards extreme democratization. For major actors, they should be encouraged to actively participate in leadership work, but they should avoid being burdened with excessive administrative work, which would hinder performance business and the improvement of their acting skills.

(4) Strengthen the political, cultural, and professional learning of troupe members to improve their ideological and artistic levels. Reform the old-fashioned apprentice and adopted daughter system, establish reasonable teacher-student relationships, promote the spirit of respecting teachers and loving students, and pay attention to providing cultural education to apprentices and young actors.

(5) Protect the health of actors and ensure their certain amount of rest and study time. Gradually eliminate unhygienic and unregulated bad habits in daily life.

II. For owner-operated troupes or disguised owner-operated troupes (i.e., formally republican-style troupes but actually controlled by owners) that still have exploitative relationships and other seriously unreasonable phenomena, help them carry out reforms on the basis of raising the awareness of the performers. First, reform repertoire and performances that are harmful to the people, and gradually change various unreasonable systems that seriously hinder the development of the troupe and the interests of the performers. For troupes with greater member mobility, such as those with only a fixed core team temporarily inviting major actors or only major actors temporarily inviting a core team, actively conduct education and, when certain conditions are met, guide and assist them to transition from a fluctuating to a fixed organization, to facilitate the improvement and enhancement of business operations.

III. Cultural administrative departments at all levels should provide specific assistance and guidance to private professional theatrical troupes, especially "republican-style" troupes, in a step-by-step and focused manner, cultivate model examples, accumulate experience in implementing artistic reforms and establishing internal troupe systems, and gradually promote them. They should guide and help troupes appropriately select repertoires to be staged, formulate performance plans, help organize actors to conduct political, cultural, and professional studies, and assist them in cultivating new actors. They should instruct affiliated state-owned troupes to establish certain guiding relationships with these troupes and learn from each other. In addition, cadres or work teams should be dispatched to troupes in a planned and step-by-step manner to provide guidance (during the work period, their supplies shall be the responsibility of the cultural administrative departments, and individuals who remain in the troupe for a longer period of time to undertake fixed work may also be supplied by the troupe). Cadres dispatched to troupes must work closely with performers, jointly devote themselves to opera reform, assist the troupe in consolidating its organization, improving its business operations, establishing an artistic work system, helping performers improve ideologically and professionally, fully exerting the performers' enthusiasm and creativity, and cultivating activists and leading backbone personnel from among them. They must respect the experience and skills of the performers, listen to their opinions, and oppose the bad work style of self-righteousness, arbitrariness, coercion, and paternalism.

IV. For troupes with significant achievements in opera reform, actors with accomplishments in performing arts, and performances of excellent repertoire, honorary or material rewards shall be given in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Ministry's December 1953 instructions on the registration and awarding of private troupes. In order to encourage free competition in art and exchange experiences in opera reform, small-scale performance viewings may be held from time to time.

V. In order to ensure the sound development of troupes, leadership over theaters should be strengthened, the ideological and artistic content of programs staged in theaters should be supervised, the internal management of theaters should be improved, various unreasonable systems and bad habits in theaters should be eliminated, safety and hygiene conditions in theaters should be improved, necessary repairs should be carried out, and the political and cultural level of theater staff should be improved, so that theaters become cultural venues that are truly beneficial to the people. Cities with a large number of theaters should establish theater management committees to unify the leadership and management of each theater.

VI. Cultural administrative departments of each province (city) that have not yet registered private professional theatrical troupes in their region should formulate methods based on the principles stipulated in the aforementioned instructions on the registration and awarding of private troupes, according to the specific situation, and register them.

VII. Cultural administrative departments in various regions must strictly review applications for the establishment of new professional theatrical troupes based on local needs and the conditions of the troupe, and must report to the cultural administrative departments above the provincial (city) level for approval, and report to the Ministry of Culture for record.

VIII. After receiving these instructions, cultural administrative departments in various regions should seriously summarize past work, study the situation of troupes in their regions in detail, distinguish their different situations, formulate specific plans based on the points mentioned in these instructions, according to the principles of key experimentation and gradual promotion, and implement them in a step-by-step and planned manner.

    中央人民政府文化部关于加强对民间职业剧团的领导和管理的指示
    近几年来，由于戏曲改革的正确方针的推行，历次社会的民主改革运动的深刻影响以及广大艺人政治觉悟的提高，全国民间职业剧团已发生了很大的变化。上演剧目和舞台形象有了革新，剧团内部关系有了改变。除小部分仍由业主所经营的剧团及一部分成员聚散无常的流动班社之外，大部分剧团已成为由艺人自己经营和管理的“共和班”式的剧团。这些剧团已由艺人受业主雇佣变为艺人自己合作经营，由包银制变为按劳取酬制；有的剧团并已开始积有公共财产（如戏箱、布景、灯光等）；剧团的领导开始采取了民主的方法。这种变化不仅基本上废除了剧团内部的剥削关系，而且提高了艺人的政治觉悟和对剧团的责任感，提高了他们的工作积极性和创造性，这就为戏曲艺术的改进和提高提供了有利的条件。
    但是目前，各地这种“共和班”式的剧团的发展是很不平衡的，情况也不尽相同。一小部分剧团组织比较健全，政治和艺术水平亦比较高。多数的剧团还只是初步实行合作经营，内部尚不健全和稳固，存在着不少严重的问题和缺点。首先是旧的制度已被革除或正在革除，新的制度一时还未能很好地建立，有的新制度还不尽合理或流于形式；艺人们在政治上虽有了显著的进步，但是还保留不少旧的思想作风，因而在工作上仍残留家长制作风或发生极端民主化倾向；在经济待遇上有分配不公或平均主义思想，因而劳动纪律松弛，缺乏长期打算，不愿积累公积金或购置公共财产；更主要的是业务上得不到改进和提高，因而不能适应广大观众的需要。产生上述各种缺点，虽有其客观的、社会的和历史的原因，但各级文化主管部门对于民间职业剧团缺乏经常领导和具体帮助，却是一个重要原因。
    民间职业剧团是一支庞大的艺术宣传队伍，为了充分发挥其积极作用，各级文化主管部门必须进一步加强领导和管理，兹特作如下指示：
    一、对于“共和班”式的剧团，应分别不同情况，采取具体的妥当的步骤，启发艺人的自觉自愿，积极帮助和鼓励其向以下几个方面努力，以逐步提高其政治质量和艺术水平。
    （一）上演优良剧目（包括经过整理改编的原有剧本和新创作的剧本），定期制订演出计划。在舞台艺术方面力求改进，继续清除丑恶形象；同时反对以庸俗表演迎合落后趣味或片面追求新奇服装布景的商业化倾向。逐渐建立严肃的排演制度。
      （二）建立基本上符合按劳取酬原则的劈份或工薪制度，逐步改革不合理的经济制度，实行经济公开、民主监督的办法。加强劳动纪律，反对平均主义思想。在逐步提高演出质量以增加收入、改善生活的基础上，积累公积金及购置公共财产并设置奖励金、福利金等。
    （三）建立民主领导，健全组织机构；加强演员之间及演员与编导、乐师及职员之间的亲密合作和团结，反对家长制作风和极端民主化倾向。对于主要演员，应吸收其积极参加领导工作，但应避免负担过多的行政事务工作，致妨碍演出业务及演技水平的提高。
      （四）加强剧团成员的政治、文化和业务的学习以提高其思想、艺术水平。改革旧式徒弟、养女制度，建立合理的师徒关系，提倡尊师爱徒的精神，注意给学徒及年青演员以文化教育。
    （五）保护演员健康，保证其一定的休息和学习时间。在日常生活方面逐步革除不合卫生和漫无规律的不良习惯。
    二、对于尚存有剥削关系及其他严重不合理现象的业主班或变相业主班（即形式上为共和班，实则仍由业主操纵的），应在提高艺人觉悟的基础上帮助其进行改革，首先应改革于人民有害的剧目和表演，并逐步改变各种严重妨碍剧团发展与艺人利益的不合理制度。对于成员流动性较大的，如仅有固定班底临时邀集主要演员或仅有主要演员临时邀集班底的剧团应积极进行教育，在具备一定条件时，引导并协助其由聚散无常到固定组织，以利于业务的改进和提高。
    三、各级文化主管部门对于民间职业剧团，首先是对于“共和班”式的剧团，应有步骤、有重点地进行具体帮助和辅导，培养典型，在实行艺术改革和建立剧团内部制度各方面积累经验，逐步推广。应指导和帮助剧团适当选择上演剧目，制订演出计划；帮助组织演员进行政治文化及业务学习并协助其培养新演员；责成所属国营剧团和这些剧团建立一定的辅导关系，互相观摩学习。此外，并应有计划有步骤地派遣干部或工作组到剧团予以辅导（在工作期间，其供给由文化主管部门负责，个别人员较长期留剧团担任固定工作者亦可由剧团供给）。凡派至剧团的干部必须与艺人密切合作，共同致力于戏曲改革，协助剧团整顿组织，改进业务，建立艺术工作制度，帮助艺人在思想上和业务上提高，充分发挥艺人的积极性和创造性，并从中培养积极分子和领导骨干。必须尊重艺人的经验和技术，倾听他们的意见，反对自以为是、独断专行、强迫命令、包办代替的恶劣作风。
    四、对于在戏曲改革上有显著成绩的剧团，在表演艺术上有成就的演员和优秀剧目的演出，应根据本部一九五三年十二月关于私营剧团登记和奖励工作的指示中规定的办法予以荣誉的或物质的奖励。为了鼓励艺术上的自由竞赛、交流戏曲改革经验，可适时举行小规模观摩演出。
    五、为了保证剧团的健全发展，应加强对剧场的领导，监督剧场上演节目的思想艺术内容，改进剧场内部的管理，革除剧场中各种不合理制度和陋规恶习，改善剧场的安全和卫生条件，进行必要的修缮，提高剧场工作人员的政治和文化水平，使剧场成为真正有益于人民的文化场所。剧场较多的城市应建立剧场管理委员会，以统一对各剧场的领导和管理。
    六、各省（市）文化主管部门对本地区民间职业剧团尚未进行登记者，应按照上述关于私营剧团登记和奖励工作的指示所规定的原则，根据具体情况制定办法，予以登记。
    七、各地文化主管部门对新的职业剧团的申请成立，必须根据当地需要和剧团条件加以严格审查，并须报经省（市）以上文化主管部门批准，报中央文化部备案。
    八、各地文化主管部门于接到本指示后，应对过去工作认真加以总结，对本地区剧团情况详细加以研究，区别其不同情况，根据本指示所提各点，按照重点试验、逐步推广的原则，有步骤、有计划地订出具体方案予以执行。
