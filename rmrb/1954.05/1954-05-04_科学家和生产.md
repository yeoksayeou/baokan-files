    Scientists and Production
    Professor I. Budnikov of the Kirov Textile Institute of Leningrad, USSR
    The development of socialist production requires continuous technological advancement in all sectors of the national economy. The Soviet people are seeking new avenues and potentials to accelerate the development of industry, transportation, and agriculture. The creative collaboration between scientific workers and producers has emerged and solidified in the struggle for technological progress. The mutual connection between the staff of industrial enterprises and scientific institutions has produced good results, enriching both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. This connection is an inexhaustible source for the development of technological ideas and the leading force for technological progress.
    Leningrad has first-class enterprises and the largest scientific research laboratories and institutes in the country. Today, there is no large enterprise or scientific institution in Leningrad whose entire staff does not regularly and enthusiastically participate in the creative collaboration between scientific and production workers.
    Scientists at the Kirov Textile Institute of Leningrad constantly assist many enterprises in the city through creative collaboration, including the "Worker" Large Textile Factory, which produces cotton fabrics, and the Telman Fine Wool and Industrial Felt United Factory. The assistance provided by scientists to producers takes various forms and diverse natures. Most scientists help enterprises solve complex technical problems and study new and most modern technological operations. I can cite a few examples.
    The Fine Wool United Factory encountered difficulties in cleaning second-grade wool. The United Factory received a large amount of second-grade wool because the fibers were not strong enough to be processed.
    The staff of the Wool Textile Teaching and Research Office conducted a series of experimental studies. They discovered a practical and effective method for pre-processing wool, which could remove impurities directly from the wool during subsequent carding without special equipment. The scientists introduced this new method to the staff of the Fine Wool United Factory. The method proved to be very good. It is now used in production and ensures the enterprise has great flexibility in using raw materials, enabling the production of high-quality woolen fabrics from even inferior wool.
    A comprehensive working group has been established in this United Factory. Scientists from the institute, the director of the United Factory, textile workers, and equipment adjustment workers all participate in the comprehensive working group. Following the suggestions of the staff of the Teaching and Research Office, the working group studied the most effective methods to reduce yarn unevenness. Through joint efforts, such a method was found. It also expanded the production of superior products.
    As everyone knows, the reduction of product costs is one of the most important indicators for measuring the working level of an enterprise. Generally speaking, the actual cost of a product needs two to three weeks after the product is produced to be determined. The leaders of the enterprise often only know the cost of products produced in February in the middle of March. At the technical committee meeting of the "Worker" Factory, with the participation of scientific workers from the institute, it was decided to try a more effective method for calculating the technical and economic indicators of the enterprise's work.
    To study this issue, many scientists, economists, process technicians, factory foremen, and the most outstanding workers participated in the comprehensive working group. The joint labor yielded results. The method studied by the working group can determine the cost during the product production process and can take some necessary measures in the production process in a timely manner. Because the "Worker" Factory adopted the new method, in the recent eight to nine months, it has not only successfully completed but also overfulfilled the plan to reduce product costs, even though the raw materials the factory received during this period were more expensive than before.
    In the creative collaboration between scientific workers and producers, the role of scientists is not limited to participating in the technical meetings and comprehensive working groups of enterprises. Scientists constantly give reports in enterprises for engineering and technical personnel, foremen, and workers. At the same time, scientists systematically answer questions for workers and engineering and technical personnel of enterprises, review their rationalization proposals, and provide creative assistance to the technical research of the most important proposals.
    The work of creative collaboration benefits scientific workers themselves a lot. The resolution of the most important practical problems in industry leads to the continuous revision, enrichment, and development of theory.
    The successful methods discovered in solving production problems are also applied in teaching work, which makes the teaching work clearer and more vivid, and turns the teaching of specialized subjects from dead dogma to lively practice. The problems that undergraduates and graduate students devote themselves to solving in their independent research work are not problems fabricated out of thin air, but problems that are adapted to the urgent needs of production.
    The resolutions recently adopted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government aimed at drastically increasing the production of daily necessities and raw materials for light industry and the food industry, have put forward new important tasks for scientific workers. In order to successfully complete the resolutions of the Party and the government, the creative collaboration between scientific workers and producers should play an important role. Soviet scientists are constantly developing and consolidating this collaboration, and they will make their own contributions to the cause of communist construction in the Soviet state.

    科学家和生产
    苏联列宁格勒基洛夫纺织专科学院教授  伊·布德尼科夫
    社会主义生产的发展要求国民经济一切部门的技术获得不断的进步，苏联人民正在寻求加速发展工业、运输业和农业的各种新途径和潜力。科学工作者和生产者之间的创造性的合作，在争取技术进步的斗争中产生并确立起来了。工业企业和科学机关工作人员的相互联系产生了良好的效果，丰富了理论知识和实际经验。这种联系是发展技术思想的取之不尽的源泉，是技术进步的主导力量。
    列宁格勒有头等的企业，有国内最大的科学研究实验室和研究所。现在，列宁格勒没有任何一个大企业和科学机关的全体人员不是经常热烈参加科学和生产工作者之间的创造性合作的。
    列宁格勒基洛夫纺织专科学院的科学家在创造性的合作中不断地帮助该城的许多企业，其中有生产棉织品的“工人”大纺织厂和台尔曼细呢与工业用呢联合工厂。科学家们对生产者的帮助，具有各种性质和多样形式。大部分科学家帮助企业解决复杂的技术问题，研究新的最现代化的技术操作法。我可以举出几个例子。
    细呢联合工厂二等品羊毛的清洗工作发生了困难。联合工厂得到了很多二等品的羊毛，因为纤维不够结实，不能加工制造。
    羊毛纺织教研室的工作人员进行了一系列的实验研究。他们发现了一种预先加工羊毛的切实有效方法，这种方法可以在以后的梳毛过程中不要特种装置就能直接从羊毛中除掉杂质。科学家们把这种新方法介绍给细呢联合工厂的工作人员。这种方法果然是很好的。现在它已运用到生产中去，并保证企业在采用原料方面有很大的机动性，它使次等羊毛也能出产质量好的毛布。
    综合工作组已在这个联合工厂里建立起来了。专科学院的科学家、联合工厂的厂长、纺织工人和调整设备的工人都参加了综合工作组。按照教研室的工作人员的建议，工作组研究减少纱的不均匀的最有效方法。在共同的努力下找到了这种方法。它也扩大了优等产品的生产。
    大家知道，产品成本的降低是衡量企业工作水平的最重要的标志之一。一般说来，产品的实际成本需要经过产品出产以后二、三个星期才能确定。企业的领导者往往在三月中旬才能知道二月份出产的产品成本如何。在有专科学院的科学工作者参加的“工人”工厂的技术委员会会议上，决定试创一种计算企业工作的技术经济指标的更有效的方法。
    为了研究这个问题，许多科学家、经济学家、工艺技师、工厂的工长和最优秀的工人都参加了综合工作组。共同的劳动获得了成效。工作组研究出来的方法能在产品生产的过程中确定成本，并能及时地在生产过程当中采取一些必要的措施。由于“工人”工厂采用了新办法，在最近八、九个月以来，不仅胜利完成而且超额完成了降低产品成本的计划，虽然在此期间这个工厂所得到的原料比以前更贵一些。
    在科学工作者和生产者之间的创造性合作中，科学家的作用还不仅限于参加企业的技术会议和综合工作组。科学家们不断地在企业里为工程技术人员、工长和工人做报告。科学家们同时还替企业的工人和工程技术人员有系统地解答疑问，审查他们的合理化建议，对最重要的建议的技术研究，给以创造性的帮助。
    创造性合作的工作，使科学工作者本身也获益很多。工业最重要的实际问题的解决，使理论得到不断地修正，不断地丰富和发展。
    在解决生产问题时发现的成功的方法，也运用在教学工作中，这使得教学工作更加明了和生动，使专门学科的教学从死教条转向生动的实践。大学生和研究生在自己的独立研究工作中所致力于解决的不是凭空臆造出来的问题，而是那种与生产的迫切需要相适应的问题。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府最近通过的旨在急剧增加日用品和轻工业以及食品工业的原料的生产的决议，向科学工作者提出了新的重要任务。为了顺利地完成党和政府的决议，科学工作者和生产者之间的创造性合作，应当起着重要的作用。苏维埃科学家不断发展和巩固着这种合作，他们将在苏维埃国家的共产主义建设事业中作出自己的贡献。
