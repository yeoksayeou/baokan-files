    Accelerate the Training of Apprentices with a New Attitude
    Zhang Jinhuai, Labor Model of the Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering
    I am a young crane operator at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. I would like to talk about the attitude that should be adopted when training apprentices, based on my own experiences.
    Last August, the organization assigned nine comrades (two of whom were women) to our group's three cranes to learn how to operate them. Team Leader Wu instructed us: we must ensure both teaching and learning, and we must not affect production or cause accidents.
    I accepted this task and was willing to do this work, but I still had some incorrect ideas in my mind. I always felt that the skills we had worked so hard to learn over two years were now being taught to others all at once, like selling something bought for 100,000 yuan for only 5,000 yuan; it felt a bit like "not breaking even."
    That day, as I was driving, I was thinking about this matter repeatedly: should I teach quickly, or slowly? If I was to teach quickly, then I would have to put in the effort to guide them hand-in-hand, and if something went wrong, I would be punished along with them; if I taught slowly? The project needed more people, but there were very few crane operators, and the machines were idle, the work couldn't be finished, and sometimes we had to work two shifts a day, and the work was still pressing. I couldn't make up my mind.
    In the evening, when I went to bed, I thought about it further: I am only twenty-two years old, and I only came to Beijing after liberation to learn technology, and I have only been a driver for a little over a month, and my wife and children are already living well with me. It can be said that there is nothing that I disagree with about the country, and I am wholeheartedly looking forward to the country being built faster and better. So, why do I, at such a young age, have this idea of "not breaking even"? Why am I not enthusiastic about teaching apprentices? I looked for the reason, and there was no other reason, mainly because: when we were apprentices, the master craftsmen were unwilling to teach us properly, and we worked hard all day long, and only managed to get some skills from the master craftsmen, and now it seems that teaching them all at once makes them worthless. I thought further: the reason why the master craftsmen treated us like that, apart from the fact that they had suffered under their own masters, was also because they had worked in the old society for a long time, and the painful experiences of the past told them "teach the apprentice, starve the master," and in the new society, the roots of this old habit and old thinking could not be removed all at once, so they used it on us.
    Now there will be no "teach the apprentice, starve the master" situation, on the contrary, if you can't teach the apprentice, the "master will be exhausted." Take the example around me, some cranes in our team have no one to operate them, and a few of us who can operate cranes have to work overtime. This is only the first factory, and in the future there will be a second, a third... The 141 major projects that the Soviet Union is helping us build all require mechanized construction, and if we don't hurry up and train apprentices, where will we find so many drivers? Besides, my master's master treated my master like this, my master treats me like this, and if I treat my apprentices like this, and in the future the apprentices go to teach their apprentices in the same way, layer upon layer, how much loss will this bring to the country. As soon as I thought this through, I made up my mind, I must change tomorrow, and any difficulties must be overcome.
    Teaching apprentices to operate is much more difficult than operating oneself. He sits in the driver's seat to operate, and I have to stand behind him and hold his hand, ready to help him correct him when he uses the wrong force, and to stop him immediately if there is any danger. They take turns learning in groups of three or four every day, while the master has to stand behind them all day long, bending over to help, and the female comrades are timid and dare not move the machine without the master. The masters are so tired after a day that their backs ache and their arms are sore. But as a result, the apprentices progressed very quickly, and after twenty days they were able to "move accurately," "land steadily," and safely. The first carriage used to take seven minutes to lift, now it only takes four minutes. At this time, we also used the time for repairing the car and at noon to disassemble the parts on the car and explain the performance and maintenance methods of the parts to the apprentices. Sometimes, we would ask the apprentices to explain in turn, and the masters would help to correct them, and sometimes we would let the apprentices install the parts, and the masters would give guidance from the side. We also studied and established a learning system outside of work, learning technology on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and learning politics on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, to ensure accelerated training. In this way, in the fifty-eight days of concrete hoisting tasks, all the apprentices mastered the technology of independent operation, and we also completed the production tasks. I was named a labor model, and my team was also named a model team.
    Through the above facts, I have fully realized that only by training apprentices with a new attitude, that is, a socialist labor attitude, can we overcome difficulties and achieve greater results.
    But this is not enough. This year our engineering tasks have increased several times, and according to the needs of the work, I have left the five-ton crane I used to drive and will be driving a fifteen-ton Soviet-made 754-type large crane. This is my first time, and I must not only work hard to master this technology, but also vigorously train my two assistants. The original apprentices have all been scattered to various cranes to work, and two have become formal drivers, but even so, there are still not enough people, so we must continue to work hard in our work and try to train more new people.
    I suggest that all the master craftsmen on the industrial front use a new attitude to vigorously train apprentices; all the apprentices should actively study hard and respect their masters. Accelerate the training of technicians to catch up with the leaping progress of the country's construction.

### 用新的态度加速培养徒工

    用新的态度加速培养徒工
    中央建筑工程部直属工程公司劳动模范　张进怀
    我是建设第一汽车制造厂的一个青年吊车司机。我愿意根据自己的一点体会，谈谈应该用什么态度培养徒工的问题。
    去年八月，组织上把九个同志（有两个是女同志），分配到我们小组的三个吊车上来学开吊车。吴大队长嘱咐说：一定要保教保学，还不能影响生产和发生事故。
    我接受了这个任务，也愿意做这个工作，但思想上却还有点不对劲的看法。我总觉得，我们辛辛苦苦用两年多时间学来的本事，一下都教给别人，就像用十万元买来的东西，只五千元就卖给了别人一样，有点“不够本”。
    我这天一边开车，一边心里翻来复去想这件事：倒底是教快点，还是慢慢来？要快，那我就得费力气来把着手教，一不小心出了事，还得跟着受处分；慢慢来呢？工程需要人多，会开吊车的人很少，机器停着，活赶不完，有时我们得一天上两班，工作还是老逼着人。这个主意拿不定。
    晚上睡觉时我就进一步盘算：我满打满算不过二十二岁，解放后才到北京学技术，实际当司机才一个多月，老婆孩子就都跟着我过好生活。可以说国家与我之间就没有什么合不来的地方，我是满心满意盼望国家建设得又快又好。那么，我年纪轻轻的，为什么有这“不够本”的念头呢？为什么对教徒弟不积极呢？我找来找去，没有别的原因，主要就是：在我们当学徒的时候，老师傅不肯好好教，我们整天辛辛苦苦，才在老师傅们手里掏了点本事来，好像现在一下教出来就不值钱了似的。我再进一步想：老师傅们所以对我们那样，除了他们跟自己的师傅受过苦以外，还因为他们在旧社会工作过很长时间，过去痛苦的经验告诉他们“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”，到了新社会，这种旧习惯、旧思想的根一下去不了，就使用到我们身上来了。
    现在不会有“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”的事，相反的，要教不会徒弟，就得“累死师傅”。就拿我身边的例子来说吧，我们队里有些吊车就没人开，而我们几个会开吊车的人却要加班加点。我们这只是第一个厂子呀，将来还有第二个、第三个……苏联帮我们建设的一百四十一项重大工程，都需要机械化施工，我们不赶快培养徒弟，那里找这么多司机呀。再说，我师傅的师傅对我师傅是这样，我师傅对我又是这样，我对徒弟再是这样，将来徒弟去教徒弟时还要这样，一层一层传下去，这得给国家带来多少损失呀。我这么一想通，主意就拿定了，明天非改过来不行，有困难就得去克服。
    教徒弟操作，比自己操作要费劲的多。他坐在司机座上操作，我要在后边把着他的手，好准备着在他劲用的不对的时候帮他纠正，遇到什么危险的时候，也好马上制止。他们每天是三、四个人轮流着学，而师傅却要整天站在他们背后弯着腰帮忙，女同志又胆小，离开师傅就不敢动机器。师傅们一天下来弄得腰疼胳膊酸的。可是这样一来，徒弟们倒是进步很快，二十天后就能做到“移的准”、“落的稳”和安全了。开始第一车要吊七分钟，现在只要四分钟就行。这时我们又利用修车和中午休息时间，拆开车上机件，给徒工讲解机件性能和保养方法。有时反过来让徒工讲，师傅们帮助纠正，有时让徒工们安装机件，师傅们从旁指点。我们又研究着订立了工作外的学习制度，星期一、三、五学技术，二、四、六学政治，来保证加速培养。这样，在五十八天吊装混凝土任务中，使所有徒工都掌握了独立操作的技术，我们也完成了生产任务，我被评为劳动模范，我这个小组也被评为模范小组。
    通过以上事实，使我充分认识到，只有用新的态度、即社会主义的劳动态度去培养学徒，才能克服困难，收到更大的成绩。
    但这还是不够的。今年我们的工程任务增加了好几倍，我已根据工作的需要，离开过去驾驶的五吨吊车，就要驾驶十五吨的苏联制七五四式大吊车了。这在我说还是第一次，必须一面努力使自己掌握这种技术，又得一面大力培养我的两个助手。原来的那些徒工都已分散到各个吊车上去工作了，有两个还当了正式司机，但就这样人还是不够用，因此，我们必须在工作中继续努力，设法培养出更多的新人手来。
    我建议我们所有在工业战线上的老师傅们，都用新的态度去大力培养学徒；所有的徒工们都积极钻研学习，尊敬师傅。加速培养技工，赶上祖国飞跃前进的建设速度。
