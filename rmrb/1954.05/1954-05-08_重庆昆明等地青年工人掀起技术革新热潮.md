Young workers in factories and mines in Southwest China have launched a movement to learn from Wang Chonglun's spirit of technical innovation.

Many young workers have learned from Wang Chonglun's responsible attitude towards national plans, raising their socialist consciousness. Eighty-five percent of the members of the Air Compressor Factory's Communist Youth League have set advanced personal guarantee conditions. When discussing the April plan, the young workers of Yan Guangqun's advanced group at Factory 610 criticized the conservative idea that "being a little higher than the administrative target is considered advanced," and actively sought key points and tricks, formulating an advanced plan. Many workers have learned from Wang Chonglun's spirit of actively studying technology, recognizing that improving labor productivity requires improving technology, and as a result, the atmosphere of studying technology has greatly increased. Among the young workers in the Fourth Workshop of Factory 101, 36 have voluntarily signed teaching contracts with veteran workers. The riveting spare-time technical study class has increased from 40 people to 80 people, and the mechanics class has increased from 50 people to 120 people.

Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation has greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm and creativity of young workers. For example, after Li Bingzhong, the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory has seen another 110 workers with improvements and creations (including 53 young workers). Yang Guojun, a young reeling worker at Factory 611, created the "fast shearing method," which increased production efficiency by three times and shortened the shut-down time. Luo Zhongyi, a young technician at the Chengdu Machinery Factory, created the "spherical tool holder," which increased production efficiency by more than three times and greatly improved quality. Liu Shujin, a Communist Youth League member at the Yibin 506 Power Plant, used waste materials to create a "triangular iron pressing machine," increasing production efficiency by eight times, and created a machine for rolling iron pipes, increasing production efficiency by one time. Li Shaozhong, a young worker at the Kunming Drilling Machine Repair Factory in Yunnan, improved his operating methods and completed the March task in seven and a half days.

    重庆昆明等地青年工人掀起技术革新热潮
    西南各地厂矿青年工人展开了学习王崇伦技术革新精神的运动。
    许多青年工人学习王崇伦对待国家计划的负责态度，提高了社会主义觉悟。空气压缩机厂有百分之八十五的团员订出了先进的个人保证条件；六一○厂燕光群先进小组的青年工人在讨论四月份计划时，批判了“只要比行政指标高一点就算先进”的保守思想，积极找关键、找窍门，订出了先进计划。许多工人学习王崇伦积极钻研技术的精神，认识到要提高劳动生产率必须提高技术，因而钻研技术的风气大大增长。一零一厂四场青年工人中，有三十六人主动和老工人订立了教学合同；铆工业余技术学习班，由原来四十人增加到八十人，机械班原为五十人，现增加到一百二十人。
    王崇伦的生产革新精神，大大激发了青年工人的生产积极性和创造性。如重庆空气压缩机厂继李秉中之后，又出现了有改进和创造的工人一百一十人（其中青年工人五十三人）；六一一厂青年摇纱工杨国君创造了“快速剪头法”，提高生产效率三倍，并缩短了关车时间；成都机械厂青年技工罗忠毅创造了“圆球刀台”，提高生产效率三倍以上，并大大提高了质量；宜宾五○六电厂团员刘树金，用废料创造了“压制三角铁机”，提高生产效率八倍，并创造了卷制铁管的机器，提高生产效率一倍；云南昆明钻机修造厂青工李绍忠改进操作方法，以七天半时间完成了三月份的任务。
