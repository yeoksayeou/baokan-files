Jiangsu Province is increasing its fresh cocoon production this year by 14% compared to last year, according to the national plan.

Last winter and this spring, the broad masses of silkworm farmers universally replenished and renewed their existing mulberry gardens. In the Suzhou Special District alone, the counties planted more than 10.04 million new mulberry seedlings this year. The masses in the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang and the abandoned Yellow River area of northern Jiangsu also planted more than 3.3 million seedlings. Silkworm farmers paid attention to pruning, cultivating, fertilizing, and pest control of the original mulberry trees, so the mulberry trees generally sprouted well this year.

The silkworm rearing season has already begun. In the mountainous areas of Yizheng and Liuhe, the silkworm egg incubation work in various counties of the Suzhou Special District is being carried out collectively under the guidance of technicians. Disinfection of all 65 incubation rooms, silkworm rearing rooms, and silkworm rearing tools throughout the province, as well as the preparation of insulation and humidification equipment, have been completed in order to hatch strong and healthy silkworms under reasonable temperature and humidity. This year, the number of silkworm breeding technology extension personnel in the province has increased to more than 700, distributed in 44 silkworm rearing counties and cities, to guide farmers in silkworm rearing in an organized manner. More than 180,000 silkworm farmer households will participate in collective silkworm egg rearing. The silkworm eggs raised in collective rearing rooms account for about 45% of the province's silkworm eggs. At present, Wuxi, Zhenze and other places have adopted a method of zonal circulation to train the backbone of collective silkworm rearing. Gaoyou, Yizheng and other counties have also specially convened meetings of silkworm farmer representatives to summarize and exchange silkworm rearing experience. Most of the more than 700 cocoon-cooking stoves in the province have been renovated and will be replaced with the recently successfully tested coal-burning method instead of the past firewood cocoon-drying method, which can not only save the province 2 billion yuan in fuel costs, but also improve the quality of silk.

    江苏省按照国家计划增产鲜茧
    江苏省今年的鲜茧产量比去年增产百分之十四。
    去冬今春，广大蚕农在原有的桑园中普遍补缺更新，仅苏州专区各县今年新栽的桑苗即有一千零四十多万株；镇江山区和苏北废黄河一带群众也栽植了三百三十多万株。蚕农对原有桑树注意整枝培育、施肥治虫，因此今年桑树一般发芽良好。
    现养蚕季节已经开始，仪征六合山区、苏州专区各县的蚕种催青工作，是在技术人员指导下集体进行的。全省六十五个催青室、蚕室和蚕具的消毒工作及保温保湿设备的整理工作都已做好，以便在合理的温度和湿度下，孵育出壮健的幼蚕。今年全省的蚕业技术推广人员增加到七百多人，分布在四十四个养蚕的县市内，有组织地指导农民养蚕。有十八万户以上蚕农将参加蚕种共育，共育室饲养的蚕种占全省蚕种的百分之四十五左右。目前，无锡、震泽等地，都已采取分区循回的办法，训练了共育养蚕的骨干；高邮、仪征等县还专门召开了蚕农代表会议，总结和交流了养蚕经验。全省七百多座茧灶大部分已进行了整修，将改用最近试验成功的烧煤法代替过去的木柴烘茧法，这不仅可使全省节省燃料费二十亿元，还能提高丝绸品质。
