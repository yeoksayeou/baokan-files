All Economic Blockades and Restrictions Should Be Lifted
Tan Rui

In his speech at the Geneva Conference on April 28, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, when discussing the issue of ensuring peace in Asia, pointed out that American aggressive actions in Asia should be stopped, peace in Asia should be guaranteed, the independence and sovereignty of Asian countries should be respected, the national rights and freedoms of Asian people should be protected, interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries should be stopped, foreign military bases in Asian countries should be removed, foreign troops stationed in Asian countries should be withdrawn, the revival of Japanese militarism should be prevented, and believed that all economic blockades and restrictions should be lifted. Obviously, this not only conforms to the desire of the people of Asia and the world to consolidate peace, but also to the interests of all countries in developing normal economies. Because restoring the disrupted traditional international economic ties is an important link in promoting the normalization of international economic relations and easing international tensions.

Promoting peaceful trade among countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis is our country's consistent position. Lei Renmin, advisor to the Chinese delegation attending the Geneva Conference, introduced China's economic development and foreign trade situation at a press conference on May 15, and reiterated China's consistent peaceful trade policy, stating that China is willing to restore and develop business and trade relations with the governments and people of any foreign country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. His speech has received attention from all sides. According to a report by the Kyodo News Agency's London correspondent, Western sources reacted by saying: "It is generally believed that this indicates that the Geneva Conference has touched on a crucial core issue in current East-West relations."

It is well known that maintaining normal economic ties with other countries is necessary for every country to maintain economic development and is also an inviolable right of every country. However, for extremely selfish purposes, the American monopoly groups have brazenly erected artificial barriers in international trade, restricting and prohibiting capitalist countries from conducting normal trade with the countries of the peace and democracy camp, infringing upon the independent sovereignty of these countries.

Facts have proven that the economic blockades and trade restrictions imposed by the United States on various countries are unreasonable. The "blockade" and "embargo" policies not only cannot prevent the countries of the peace and democracy camp from smoothly carrying out peaceful economic construction and continuously achieving success, but have greatly consolidated the mutual assistance and cooperation among the countries in this camp. The rapid recovery and development of China's foreign trade fully demonstrates the complete bankruptcy of the so-called blockade and embargo policy. In the past four years, the total value of China's foreign trade has increased more than fivefold, greatly exceeding the pre-war level; and it has fundamentally changed the dependence of old China's foreign trade on imperialism, and established new foreign trade relations with foreign countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, transforming the situation of import surplus for more than 70 years into a situation of basically balanced imports and exports. Delanny, Deputy Director of the U.S. Foreign Aid Affairs Administration responsible for the implementation of the Battle Act, also helplessly admitted in his testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives recently that the blockade and embargo of the past few years "cannot seriously damage" the economies of the countries in the peace and democracy camp.

Those who are truly harmed by the U.S. embargo policy are those countries that succumb to the United States and implement trade restrictions. As British Labor MP Silverman said, the "only result" of implementing the "embargo" policy is "to blockade ourselves."

Due to the pursuit of the U.S.'s "embargo" policy, the traditional trade between various capitalist countries and China has been severely damaged. For example, in Britain, since following the United States in implementing an "embargo" against China, trade with China has fallen to less than 10 percent of its historical peak. The trade volume between other capitalist countries and China has also plummeted, which inevitably has had an adverse impact on the economies of these countries. The sharp decline in trade between Western European countries and China has further increased their difficulties in raw material shortages and export shrinkage caused by the cessation of trade with Eastern Europe. This not only affects their industrial production but also deepens their economic dependence on the United States, allowing the United States to carry out unrestricted expansion in these countries. Asian and American countries that rely on raw material exports as their main income have had to endure the double plunder of the United States' low-price acquisition of raw materials and large-scale dumping of goods because trade with China and other countries in the peace and democracy camp has been restricted. Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaya have been forced to implement "embargoes" by the United States and have their trade monopolized by the United States. Since then, they have changed from previous trade surpluses to huge trade deficits and fallen into a very difficult economic situation. Taking Indonesia as an example, in the two years and eight months from May 1951 to the end of 1953 alone, the total value of rubber exports decreased by as much as 1 billion US dollars due to the decline in prices and export volume caused by the "embargo." Because rubber prices were suppressed by the United States, Indonesia lost approximately 2 billion guilders in foreign exchange in the first quarter of 1953 alone. Japan, which has long had economic relations with China, has suffered particularly severely from the U.S. "embargo" policy. Just comparing the total trade volume between Japan and China and the Soviet Union in 1950, Japan has done approximately 150 million US dollars less business in the past three years, and the Japanese bourgeois newspapers believe that, due to China's economic development, the trade that can be done between the two countries in recent years will obviously be much larger than in 1950.

Based on the facts cited above, it is not difficult for people to see that the U.S. ruling clique's imposition of the so-called blockade and embargo policy on various countries has another ulterior motive. This purpose is to use this to strengthen its monopoly on the world capitalist market, control the economies of these countries, and carry out economic plunder as it pleases. American monopoly capitalists are now using the involuntary weakness of other capitalist countries in trade to export economic crises, which has already caused unease in these countries. The Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Conference held in Sydney in January this year discussed resisting the impact of the U.S. economic crisis and issued a communique saying:
"We must not ignore any market, and we must develop our export trade to every possible place."

The stakes are so clear that it is unimaginable that the United States' trade manipulation policy will not arouse growing dissatisfaction and opposition from various capitalist countries. The broad masses of people in capitalist countries have firmly opposed this disastrous economic blockade from the beginning, and businessmen and far-sighted politicians in various countries have also increasingly frequently called for the restoration and development of normal trade with China and other countries in the peace and democracy camp. At the International Economic Conference held in Moscow in April 1952, representatives from many countries scrambled to make trade contacts with the Chinese delegation and signed trade agreements worth more than 200 million US dollars. Since then, many countries' governments and trade groups have sent delegations to China to discuss trade. Countries such as Ceylon have disregarded the U.S. "ban" and carried out rubber and rice exchange transactions with our country. The trade volume between many capitalist countries and China has also continued to grow. For example, according to British official statistics, the total value of British exports to China in 1953 increased by 75% compared to 1950, and the total value of imports also returned to the level of 1950. This shows that the vital interests of most capitalist countries do not allow them to sever economic ties with countries in the peace and democracy camp, especially the People's Republic of China.

It is worth noting that not only are calls for trade with the peace and democracy camp rising in Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America, but also more and more people in the U.S. business community are talking about the necessity of restoring East-West trade. The American exporter's publication "The Exporter" conducted a survey of opinions on American trade policy at the beginning of this year. This survey questioned 576 heads of export departments of several companies whose annual export volume is nearly 1.5 billion US dollars. Regarding the question of whether they are willing to conduct more active trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, 228 people gave affirmative answers. Ernest Weir, chairman of National Steel Corporation, also recently stated that he believes that trade "cannot be restricted indefinitely"; Japan and Western Europe both need the Chinese market.

However, a small handful of American monopoly capitalists only hope to strengthen their monopoly on the world capitalist market and pursue bloody profits from expanding armaments and preparing for war. Therefore, they fear that expanding East-West trade will promote further easing of international tensions and affect the dominant position of American capital. According to a report in the French "Tribune des Nations" on March 5, Walter Robertson, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, openly said: "The opening of the Chinese market will prompt Britain and Japan to distance themselves from the United States and will reduce the United States' actual leadership in the free world." Therefore, in the past year, the United States has repeatedly coerced other capitalist countries to strengthen the embargo against China, restrict ships from carrying goods to China, and even intensified its actions by directing the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Taiwan to continuously intercept merchant ships of various countries, threatening countries to sever trade with China in order to save its already bankrupt "embargo" policy. Even during the Geneva Conference, the United States instigated Chiang's bandits to illegally detain another Polish merchant ship. It is obvious that the American aggressors are attempting to continue to use economic blockades and trade restrictions as a step in their aggressive policy to create tensions.

Due to the United States' persistence in implementing a policy of destroying international trade, trade between countries is still in an extremely abnormal state. But everyone can see that the possibility of restoring and developing normal international trade relations is fully available.

Our country and other countries in the peace and democracy camp believe that countries with different political and economic systems can coexist peacefully, exchange goods, and establish and develop normal trade relations. The facts of the past few years have proven that suggestions from all countries willing to develop trade with our country, as long as they are based on the principle of equality and in line with mutual interests, will inevitably be welcomed by our country. By pursuing such a peaceful trade policy, our country has established trade relations with the governments or business communities of more than 50 countries in the past four years, and the governments or industrial and trade circles of more than 20 of these countries have established formal trade ties with our country. Undoubtedly, China's foreign trade has broad prospects.

The convening of the Geneva Conference has brought new hope to those who long for the restoration of normal East-West trade. They all believe that such an international conference should pave the way for promoting the normalization of international trade. Therefore, recently, calls for lifting blockades and embargoes have risen further in capitalist countries. British Prime Minister Churchill also said not long ago that he hoped the Geneva Conference might open the door to expanding trade with China; Indonesian authorities also expressed support for all efforts to abolish the "embargo" against the People's Republic of China. The abolition of all economic blockades and restrictions has become the unanimous demand of all those who are concerned about their own interests and easing international tensions. The group that is hostile to world peace and international cooperation can only isolate themselves if they try to obliterate this strong demand.

    一切经济封锁和限制应该取消
    谭文瑞
    周恩来外长四月二十八日在日内瓦会议上的发言在谈到保证亚洲和平问题的时候，指出美国在亚洲的侵略行动应该被制止，亚洲的和平应该得到保证，亚洲各国的独立和主权应该得到尊重，亚洲人民的民族权利和自由应该得到保障，对亚洲各国的内政的干涉应该停止，在亚洲各国的外国军事基地应该撤除，驻在亚洲各国的外国军队应该撤退，日本军国主义的复活应该防止，并认为一切经济封锁和限制应该取消。显然，这不仅符合于亚洲及世界各国人民巩固和平的愿望，而且也符合于各国发展正常经济的利益。因为，恢复被破坏了的传统的国际经济联系，是促进国际经济关系正常化和缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要环节。
    促进各国间平等互利的和平贸易，是我国的一贯主张。出席日内瓦会议的我国代表团顾问雷任民五月十五日在记者招待会上介绍了我国经济发展和对外贸易的情况，并重申我国所一贯奉行的和平贸易政策，表明我国愿意在平等与互利的基础上恢复和发展与任何外国的政府和人民之间的商务和贸易关系。他的谈话受到了各方面的重视。据日本共同社驻伦敦记者报道西方国家人士的反应说：“一般认为，这表示日内瓦会议触及现在东西方关系上最重要的一个核心。”
    人所共知，与别国维持正常的经济联系是每个国家维持经济发展所必需，也是每个国家不可侵犯的权利。但是，美国垄断集团为了极其自私的目的，竟悍然在国际贸易中强行建立起人为的藩篱，限制和禁止资本主义各国与和平民主阵营国家进行正常的贸易，侵害这些国家的独立主权。
    事实证明，美国强加在各国头上的经济封锁和贸易限制是毫无道理的。“封锁”“禁运”政策不但丝毫不能阻止和平民主阵营各国顺利地进行和平的经济建设并不断地取得成就，而且反而大大地巩固了这个阵营中各国间的互助合作。就以我国对外贸易迅速恢复和发展的情况来看，就充分证明了所谓封锁禁运政策的彻底破产。在过去四年中，我国对外贸易的总值已增加了五倍多，大大超过了战前的水平；而且从根本上改变了旧中国对外贸易对帝国主义的依附性，并根据平等互利的原则与外国建立了新的对外贸易关系，把七十多年来入超的局面转变为进出口基本上平衡的局面。负责执行巴特尔法的美国援外事务管理署副署长德朗尼最近在美国众议院中作证时，也无可奈何地承认：几年来的封锁禁运“并不能严重地损害”和平民主阵营各国的经济。
    真正受到美国禁运政策的损害的，是屈从美国实行贸易限制的那些国家。正如英国工党议员锡尔弗曼所说的，执行“禁运”政策的“唯一结果是把自己封锁起来”。
    由于奉行美国的“禁运”政策，各资本主义与中国的传统贸易受到了严重的损害。例如英国，自从追随美国对中国实行“禁运”以来，对中国的贸易下降到不及历史上最高水平的百分之十。其他资本主义国家和中国的贸易额也是一落千丈，这不可避免地对这些国家的经济产生了不利的影响。西欧各国对华贸易的锐减，更增加了它们由于停止与东欧贸易而造成的原料不足和出口萎缩的困难，这不仅影响到它们的工业生产，而且不能不加深它们在经济上对美国的依赖，使美国得以对这些国家进行无限制的扩张。亚洲和美洲依靠原料输出为主要收入的国家，由于对中国及和平民主阵营其他国家的贸易受到限制，只得忍受美国低价收购原料和大量倾销商品的双重劫掠。像印尼、泰国、马来亚等东南亚国家，自从被美国强迫实行“禁运”并被美国垄断了它们的贸易之后，都从以往的出超变成为巨额的入超，陷于经济情况十分恶劣的困境。以印度尼西亚来说，仅橡胶一项，自一九五一年五月到一九五三年年底的两年零八个月中，由于实行“禁运”而造成价格和出口额的下降，橡胶出口总值减少了十亿美元之多。印尼因为橡胶被美国压价，在一九五三年第一季里就已损失了约合二十亿盾的外汇。长期与中国有经济关系的日本，蒙受美国“禁运”政策的损害尤为严重。仅以一九五○年日本与中、苏的贸易总额来比较，日本这三年来就少做了约值一亿五千万美元的生意，而日本资产阶级报刊都认为，由于中国经济的发展，这几年两国间可做的买卖显然会比一九五○年大得多。
    根据以上所引述的事实，人们就不难看清美国统治集团强迫各国实行所谓封锁禁运政策有另一个不可告人的目的，这个目的就是借此加强对世界资本主义市场的垄断，控制这些国家的经济，进行任所欲为的经济掠夺。美国垄断资本家现在正在利用其他资本主义国家在贸易上不由自主的弱点来输出经济危机，并已经引起了这些国家的不安。今年一月间在悉尼召开的英联邦财长会议，就曾为抵抗美国经济危机的影响而进行了讨论，并发表公报说：
  “我们是决不能忽视任何市场的，我们必须向一切可能的地方发展我们的出口贸易。”
    利害是如此的分明，美国操纵贸易的政策要想不引起各资本主义国家日益增长的不满和反对是不可想像的。资本主义各国广大人民自始就坚决反对这种灾难性的经济封锁，各国工商界人士和有远见的政界人士也愈来愈频繁地发出呼吁，要求恢复和发展与中国及和平民主阵营其他各国的正常贸易。在一九五二年四月在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议上，许多国家的代表就争相与中国代表团进行贸易接触，并签订了价值两亿多美元的贸易协议。从那以后，许多国的政府和贸易团体纷纷派遣了代表团到中国来商谈贸易。锡兰等国家，并不顾美国的“禁令”，与我国进行了交换橡胶、大米的交易。许多资本主义国家与中国的贸易额也不断增长。例如根据英国官方统计数字，英国在一九五三年对华出口总值就比一九五○年增加了百分之七十五，进口总值也恢复到了一九五○年的水平。这说明了大多数资本主义国家的切身利益不容许它们断绝与和平民主阵营各国、特别是中华人民共和国的经济联系。
    值得注意的是，不仅要求与和平民主阵营进行贸易的呼声在西欧、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国日益高涨，而且在美国的工商界中间也有愈来愈多的人在谈论恢复东西方贸易的必要性了。美国出口商的刊物“公报”今年年初举办了一次对于美国贸易政策的意见的调查，这次调查询问了每年出口额差不多达十五亿美元的若干家公司出口部门的五百七十六名负责人。对于他们是否愿意和苏联及人民民主国家进行更活跃的贸易问题，有二百二十八人作了肯定的答复。美国国民钢铁公司董事长威尔最近也表示，他认为贸易是“不能无限期加以限制”的；日本和西欧都很需要中国的市场。
    但是，一小撮美国垄断资本家只希望加强对世界资本主义市场的垄断，从扩军备战中追求血腥的利润，因此害怕扩展东西方贸易会促成国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，并影响美国资本的支配地位。据三月五日法国“民族论坛”报道，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊公然说：“中国市场的打开会促使日英两国与美国疏远，并会减低美国在自由世界实际上的领导作用。”因此，近一年来美国一再胁迫其他资本主义国家加强对中国的禁运，限制各国船只向中国运货，甚至变本加厉地指使台湾蒋介石残余匪帮不断截劫各国商船，威胁各国断绝与中国的贸易，以挽救其业已破产的“禁运”政策。就在日内瓦会议期间，美国就唆使蒋匪帮非法截扣了又一艘波兰商船。显而易见，美国侵略者企图继续利用经济封锁和贸易限制作为它推行侵略政策制造紧张局势的一个步骤。
    由于美国一意孤行地实行破坏国际贸易的政策，各国间的贸易仍然处于极不正常的状态。但是谁都看得见，恢复和发展正常的国际贸易关系的可能性却是完全具备的。
    我国和和平民主阵营其他各国都相信不同政治和经济制度的国家能够和平共处，互通有无，建立和发展正常贸易关系。过去几年的事实已证明，一切国家愿意和我国发展贸易的建议，只要是基于平等的原则，符合互相的利益的，都必然会受到我国的欢迎。由于奉行这样的和平贸易政策，我国在过去四年中已与五十多个国家的政府或工商界人士发生了贸易关系，其中有二十多个国家的政府或工业和贸易界人士已与我国建立了正式的贸易联系。无容置疑的，我国的对外贸易具有广阔的前景。
    日内瓦会议的召开，给渴望恢复东西方正常贸易的人们带来了新的希望。他们都认为这样一个国际会议应当为促使国际贸易正常化开辟道路。因此最近以来在资本主义各国，要求解除封锁禁运的呼声更形高涨。英国首相邱吉尔不久以前也说他希望日内瓦会议可能为扩大和中国贸易打开大门；印尼权威人士并表示赞同为取消对中华人民共和国的“禁运”而进行的一切努力。取消一切经济封锁和限制已成为所有关心切身利益与缓和国际紧张局势的人们的一致要求，敌视世界和平与国际合作的集团要想抹煞这种强烈的要求，只能使它们自己陷于极端孤立的境地。
