This spring, coastal Jiangsu Province has seen a widespread bumper harvest of yellow croaker. The total catch for the entire season reached over 650,000 dan (a unit of weight), exceeding the original planned output of 550,000 dan by 18%, and representing a 54% increase compared to last year's total catch of over 420,000 dan. This is an unprecedented bumper harvest for the province. The total value of the spring catch will reach over 100 billion yuan, and the income of fishermen and fishing workers has generally increased by more than double compared to last year, with their living standards also improving.

This year, 818 fishing boats from twelve counties and cities along the coast of the province, with a total of more than 13,000 fishermen and fishing workers participating in the fishing operations. Before the spring season, they reorganized mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. Fishing boats from all ports went to sea and cast their nets ahead of schedule. According to statistics from Rudong, Haimen, Chongming, and Qidong counties, a total of 87 fishing boats made two trips to sea during the season (going out to sea twice in one fishing season), increasing fish production by more than 27,000 dan. Many moving stories of overcoming difficulties and achieving bumper harvests emerged from the fishermen and fishing workers during their production at sea. Zhang Deyin's fishing boat from Jianggang, Dongtai County, lost its large anchor at sea during the second trip, but the fishing workers continued production by binding bamboo together, and they still achieved a bumper harvest as a result. When a school of fish surged in, Wu Futai's fishing boat from Huagang, Rudong County, had its large net torn, but the fishing workers were still able to risk repairing it, causing the entire school of fish to fall into the net.

During this year's fishing season, state-owned aquatic product companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, under the leadership of local Party and government, did a good job in supplying materials and marketing fish products, enabling fishing boats to go to sea early. After the fish products entered the port, they were able to sell them in a timely manner, allowing the fishing boats to continue to go to sea without delaying the fishing season.

This spring season, the government lent a total of more than 15.4 billion yuan in production loans to fishermen throughout the province. The soldiers of the coastal defense forces protected the fishermen's production at sea and enthusiastically took care of the fishermen in all aspects, which is also one of the reasons for this year's bumper fish harvest.

    江苏省沿海今年春汛黄花鱼空前大丰收
    江苏省沿海春汛黄花鱼今年普遍丰收。全汛共产鱼六十五万余担，超过原订计划产量五十五万担的百分之十八，比去年全汛产量四十二万余担增产百分之五十四。这是该省过去从未有过的大丰收。春汛全省产值将达一千余亿元，渔民和渔工的收入较去年普遍增加一倍以上，生活也得到了改善。
    今年，该省沿海十二个县、市，出海渔船八百一十八只，参加捕捞的渔民、渔工共有一万三千多人。他们在春汛前整理了互助合作组织，生产热情空前高涨，各港渔船都提前出海下网。据如东、海门、崇明、启东四县的统计，打复水（在一个汛期中出海捕捞两次）的渔船共有八十七只，增产鱼二万七千余担。渔民和渔工们在海上生产，出现许多克服困难、获得丰收的动人事例，东台县弶港渔船张德寅二汛中在海上断了大锚，渔工们用毛竹绑结继续生产，结果仍得到了丰收。如东县环港吴福泰渔船在鱼群涌来时，大网被胀破，但渔工们仍能冒险抢修，使鱼群全部落网。
    今年鱼汛中，各地国营水产公司、供销合作社在当地党、政领导下，做好了物资供应和鱼产推销工作，使渔船能提早出海；在鱼产进港以后，又能及时的推销出去，使渔船能够继续出海，不耽误汛期。
    今年春汛中政府贷放给渔民的生产贷款，全省共有一百五十四亿余元。海防部队的战士在海上保护渔民生产，并且从各方面热情的照顾渔民，这也是今年鱼汛丰产的原因之一。
