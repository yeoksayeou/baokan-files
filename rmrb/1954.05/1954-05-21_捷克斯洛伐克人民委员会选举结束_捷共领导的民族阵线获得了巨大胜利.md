Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 19th: The Czechoslovak people nationwide participated in the election of the People's Committees on the 16th with high political enthusiasm. According to the preliminary election results announced by the Central Election Committee, 98.2 percent of voters nationwide participated in the voting, and 93.5 percent of the voters voted for the candidates of the National Front led by the Communist Party.

On the day of the election, Czechoslovakia presented a festive scene throughout the country. National flags fluttered over the polling stations, decorated with colorful flowers. Early in the morning, loudspeakers everywhere broadcast music. Men and women voters everywhere, dressed in festive attire, happily gathered at the polling stations. At exactly 7:00 AM, polling stations across the country opened simultaneously, and voters entered the polling stations in turn to cast their votes. Voters were very enthusiastic in voting. By 2:00 PM, more than 80 percent of the voters nationwide had already cast their votes. All the voters in many electoral districts had completed their voting long before the deadline.

The sentiments expressed by the voters who participated in the voting expressed the people's support for the National Front from various perspectives. Mullernek, a machine tool worker at the "Sckde-Stalingrad" factory in Prague, said: "I went to vote at 9:00 AM as soon as I got off work. The well-equipped and completely modernized large health center built in our Visochany workers' district alone shows how the National Front cares for the workers. Voting for the National Front candidates is voting for socialism and happiness." Dackina, an 80-year-old man from the Dolni Przelnize district, said: "I feel it is my responsibility to elect such good National Front candidates. When I put my ballot into the ballot box, I thought to myself: I am electing socialism and peace." Wiebel, a member of the unified agricultural cooperative in the district, said: "Last year, my wife and I both received very high average monthly incomes from the cooperative. This is all due to the leadership of the People's Committee composed of representatives of the National Front. I hope that the cooperative will continue to develop, so I voted for the National Front candidates." Marsinova, a 70-year-old woman from the Old Town district of Prague, said: "I can now receive a pension every month, and the People's Committee of the National Front takes good care of me. I know these candidates, and I know that when I vote for them, I am voting for the unity of the people across the country, because unity can bring more happiness."

    捷克斯洛伐克人民委员会选举结束
    捷共领导的民族阵线获得了巨大胜利
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】捷克斯洛伐克全国人民十六日以高涨的政治热情进行了人民委员会的选举。据中央选举委员会公布的初步的选举结果，全国百分之九十八点二的选民参加了投票，其中百分之九十三点五的选民投票选举共产党领导的民族阵线的候选人。
    在选举的那一天，捷克斯洛伐克全国呈现一片节日景象。各选举站飘扬着国旗，装饰着各色的鲜花。一清早，各处的扩音器就放送出音乐。各地男女选民们穿着节日的服装，喜气洋洋地向选举站汇集。七时正，全国各地的选举站同时开放，选民们依次进入选举站进行投票。选民们投票十分踊跃。到下午二时，全国百分之八十以上的选民已投完了票。许多选区的全部选民都在投票截止时间以前很久就投完了票。
    参加投票的选民们发表的感想从各个不同角度表达了人民对民族阵线的拥戴。首都布拉格“斯克德—斯大林格勒”工厂的机器制造工人穆勒涅克说：上午九点钟一下班，我就去投了票。单是在我们威索哈尼工人区建立的那所设备齐全、完全现代化的大保健馆，就可以说明我们的民族阵线是怎样关心工人了。我投了民族阵线候选人的票，就是投了社会主义和幸福的票。多尔尼普泽尔尼泽区的八十岁老人达契纳说：我觉得选举这样好的民族阵线候选人是我的责任。我把选票投入选票箱时心里就想着：我选举的是社会主义及和平。该区统一农业合作社社员魏布尔说：去年我们夫妇两人从合作社平均每月都得到了很高的收入。这都是民族阵线的代表组成的人民委员会领导我们获得的。我希望合作社继续发展，所以我投票选举民族阵线候选人。布拉格旧城选区的七十岁老大娘玛尔西诺娃说：我现在每月都可以领到养老金，民族阵线的人民委员会对我照顾得很好。我了解这些候选人，我知道我投了他们的票，也就是投了全国人民团结的票，因为团结能带来更多的幸福。
