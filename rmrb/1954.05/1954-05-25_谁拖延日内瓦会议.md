    Who is Delaying the Geneva Conference
    By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao
    Today, the world-瞩目 Geneva Conference enters its fifth week. In the past four weeks, the Geneva Conference has held eleven plenary discussions and one closed-door meeting on the Korean issue, and four plenary discussions and four closed-door meetings on the Indochina issue. Although it is too early to summarize the work of the conference, the progress of the conference has not been as smooth as world opinion expected. This is a fact that cannot be ignored.
    Who is delaying the Geneva Conference? Peace-loving people have every right to ask such questions. Some American newspapers are trying to instill in their readers the concept that "the Communists are delaying the Geneva Conference."
    Naturally, it is not difficult to fabricate an answer at will, but the facts are not so easily obscured. It is not the peaceful and democratic countries that are delaying and hindering the progress of the Geneva Conference; on the contrary, it is the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam who are working hard to promote the early conclusion of an agreement at the Geneva Conference.
    The peaceful settlement of the Korean question was originally one of the two major tasks of the Geneva Conference. In Korea, the war has stopped, but it is extremely unstable. Foreign troops are still stationed there, and the Syngman Rhee clique is constantly clamoring for armed reunification, and the danger of renewed war still exists. The Korean people's desire to establish an independent, peaceful, and democratic unified state has not yet been realized. Establishing a solid peace in Korea so that the Korean people can handle their own affairs according to their own wishes is obviously a matter of urgency. On the first day of the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean issue, Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a proposal that was considered fair, reasonable and practical by all impartial public opinion. This proposal was fully supported by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov. They repeatedly hoped to use Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal as the basis for discussion and reach a satisfactory agreement through full consultation. However, the delegations of certain countries headed by the United States did not have the same desire. Syngman Rhee's representative, Byun Yung-tai's two speeches were filled with distortions of facts, slander and abuse. US representative Dulles rejected Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal unreasonably in his speech, but he did not put forward any plan for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, but only reiterated the illegal UN resolution of October 7, 1950, which the United States had fought for three years without achieving.
    After this, plenary meetings were held one after another. Representatives of other countries that invaded Korea spoke sporadically at the meeting. Some of them said that they spoke only to avoid the misunderstanding that they did not support American policy, and some of them had to admit that Nam Il's proposal should be seriously considered. Some also hoped that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, but they could not jump out of the circle of illegal UN resolutions delimited by Dulles, and without exception, they could not put forward any solutions. During this period, a seven-nation closed-door meeting was held, which did not help the progress of the conference. Dulles left Geneva a week after the meeting began amidst the "greatest failure of American diplomacy." His replacement, Smith, did not relax his behind-the-scenes activities to obstruct the progress of the conference. As time passed, people also knew that the sixteen-nation conference presided over by the American representative was held intermittently, but they were busy drawing up a plan to deceive world opinion in order to cover up the truth that the United States refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    It was not until twenty-seven days after the discussion of the Korean issue began that Byun Yung-tai put forward a so-called fourteen-point proposal. This "proposal" was so poorly disguised that people could see at a glance that it was only a concretization of the illegal UN resolution, that is, to expand the Syngman Rhee regime to North Korea through so-called "free elections" under the supervision and approval of the so-called United Nations and under the occupation and protection of the US military. The reaction caused by this "proposal" in Geneva was so unfavorable to those who had participated in it that they hurried to deny that it was a sixteen-nation proposal. Spokesmen for the French and British delegations said at a press conference on the 22nd that it was only a proposal from South Korea. Aren't these actions of the Western countries' representatives headed by the United States delaying rather than promoting the progress of the Geneva Conference?
    On the contrary, the peaceful and democratic countries, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, which participated in the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, have repeatedly worked hard to promote the conclusion of an agreement at the conference. Just as the discussion of the Korean issue was at a standstill, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made a supplementary proposal to Foreign Minister Nam Il's April 27 plan at the meeting on the 22nd, namely, to organize a neutral country committee to assist and supervise the holding of all-Korean elections. This supplementary proposal not only respected the principle of the Korean people handling their own affairs, but also took into account the special situation of the long-term confrontation between North and South Korea, which helped to bring the two sides closer to agreement. However, the representatives of the United States and Syngman Rhee could not wait to reject this supplementary proposal again, once again indicating that what they were pursuing was not to make the conference reach an agreement quickly, but to obstruct the settlement of the Korean issue.
    The Korean issue is like this, and so is the Indochina issue. Restoring peace in Indochina is another task of the Geneva Conference. There, the war continues and there is a serious danger of it expanding due to the United States' increasingly intensified intervention. The discussion of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference should have started as soon as possible, but the representatives of the United States and France have successively adopted delaying tactics. Initially, the representatives of the United States and France refused to invite the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate, which delayed the start of the discussion on the Indochina issue. Later, after agreeing to invite the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in the discussion, the conference was originally scheduled to begin on May 6, but the French side unreasonably requested a two-day postponement. In this way, the Indochina issue, which the people of the world urgently demanded to be resolved, began twelve days later than the Korean issue.
    After the meeting began, Bidault finally put forward a solution. However, this plan only talked about military issues, completely ignoring political issues, that is, completely ignoring the national rights of the Indochinese people. Moreover, in this plan on military armistice, France, posing as the victor, put forward one-sided and unreasonable conditions such as disbanding the Lao and Cambodian resistance armies and eliminating the Vietnamese people's irregular armed forces. Naturally, it cannot be said that it truly hoped that the Indochina issue would be resolved quickly.
    In contrast, Pham Van Dong put forward a comprehensive, fair and reasonable proposal. This proposal not only included a military armistice, but also a political settlement; it not only conformed to the national interests of the Indochinese people, but also took into account the economic and cultural interests of France; it not only included the settlement of the Vietnam issue, but also the settlement of the Lao and Cambodian issues. This is a major effort by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to sincerely hope for a peaceful settlement of the issue. However, in the four plenary discussions, the representatives of the United States, France, and other countries stubbornly denied the rationality of Pham Van Dong's proposal and stubbornly insisted on their unreasonable demands, causing the conference to stagnate.
    In order to promote the progress of the conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made two supplements to Pham Van Dong's proposal on May 14, namely:
  (1) To organize a neutral country committee to assist and supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement; (2) The participating countries jointly guarantee the implementation of the armistice agreement. The active efforts of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China created good conditions for the conference to enter the stage of specific consultations.
    The closed-door meeting to discuss the Indochina issue began on May 17. At the first closed-door meeting, the representatives of the United States, France, and other countries repeatedly insisted on their unreasonable demands on the discussion procedure, demanding that Bidault's proposal be used as the basis for discussion, refusing to discuss a political settlement, and only agreed to Molotov's proposal at the end, that is, to combine Pham Van Dong's plan and Bidault's plan for discussion. Not only discuss the military armistice, but also discuss the political settlement; the military armistice is discussed first. However, at the second closed-door meeting, the representatives of the United States and France again raised a side issue, demanding that the Lao and Cambodian issues be handled separately first. Originally, at the beginning of the general debate, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam suggested that the resistance governments of Laos and Cambodia be invited to participate, considering that the conference was discussing the entire Indochina issue, including not only Vietnam but also Laos and Cambodia. However, the representatives of the United States, France, and other countries rejected this outrageously. In order to make the conference progress quickly, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai suggested that the conference should listen to the opinions of the representatives of the resistance governments of Laos and Cambodia, but this was again rejected. Now the representatives of the United States, France, and other countries are unreasonably demanding that the issues of these two countries be handled separately first, that is, demanding the dissolution of the resistance governments and armies of the two countries, which has caused the closed-door meeting to fall into time-consuming and useless arguments. The second, third, and most of the fourth closed-door meetings were spent debating this issue provoked by the representatives of the United States, France, and other countries. It was not until the end that after this unreasonable demand was criticized by the representatives of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union, the representatives of the United States, France, Britain, and other countries had to accept the discussion procedure proposed by Molotov and the five issues related to the military armistice.
    It is not difficult for people to see from here who is delaying the time in the discussion of the Indochina issue.
    Looking back at the work of the Geneva Conference in the past four weeks, people can see more clearly that the policy of the American representatives and their followers is to try their best to obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference. They look for every opportunity to obstruct the conclusion of an agreement. What Dulles and Smith are pursuing is to prove in the Geneva Conference that consultation is impossible, so that the United States can maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, continue and expand the Indochina war, increase the tension in the international situation, and promote its repeatedly thwarted "policy of strength." However, people have also seen that the delaying and obstructing activities of the United States and its followers have been strongly counterattacked by the peaceful and democratic countries and condemned by the broad social opinion of various countries. The Geneva Conference is laboriously but surely moving forward step by step over the roadblocks set up by the Washington authorities.
    Now, the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference has been stalled due to the obstruction of the United States, and the discussion of the Indochina issue has entered the stage of specific consultation due to the efforts of the representatives of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China. Observers here are discussing that the fifth week of work of the Geneva Conference has decisive significance. The task of peace-loving people all over the world is to redouble their efforts to defeat the obstruction and sabotage of the United States and its followers and strive for the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement of great significance to world peace.

    谁拖延日内瓦会议
    本报记者  吴文焘
    今天举世瞩目的日内瓦会议进入它的第五周了。在过去的四个星期中，日内瓦会议已就朝鲜问题举行了十一次大会讨论和一次秘密会议，印度支那问题举行了四次大会讨论和四次秘密会议，虽然现在来对会议的工作加以总结为时尚早，但是会议的进展并不如世界舆论所期待的那样顺利，这是不容忽视的事实。
    谁在拖延日内瓦会议？爱好和平人民完全有权利提出这样的问题。一些美国报纸企图给它们的读者灌输这样的概念：“共产党拖延着日内瓦会议”。
    自然随便虚构一个答案是不难的，但是事实并不那么容易被蒙蔽。拖延和阻挠日内瓦会议工作进展的，并不是和平民主国家；恰恰相反，正是苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及越南民主共和国的外长们努力促使日内瓦会议尽早地达成协议。
    朝鲜问题的和平解决本来是日内瓦会议的两大任务之一。在朝鲜，战争虽已停止下来了，然而是极不稳定的。外国军队依然驻留在那里，李承晚集团不断地叫嚣着要武力统一，战争再起的危险性依然存在着。朝鲜人民要建立一个独立、和平、民主的统一国家的愿望远还没有实现。在朝鲜建立巩固的和平，使朝鲜人民能够根据自己的意愿来处理自己的事务，显然是迫不容缓的。在日内瓦会议开始讨论朝鲜问题的第一天，南日外务相就提出了一个被所有公正舆论认为是公平合理、切实可行的建议，这个建议得到了周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长的完全支持。他们一再希望以南日外务相的建议作为讨论的基础，经过充分的协商达成双方满意的协议。但是以美国为首的某些国家的代表团并没有抱有同样的愿望。李承晚的代表卞荣泰的两次发言，只是堆满了对事实的歪曲，诽谤和谩骂。美国代表杜勒斯在发言中毫无理由地就悍然拒绝了南日外务相的建议，但他并没有提出任何和平解决朝鲜问题的方案，而只是重申了美国打了三年仗也没有能实现的一九五零年十月七日联合国非法决议。
    在这以后，全体大会一次又一次地举行了。其他侵朝国家的代表零零落落地在会上发了言。他们中间有的人表示他之所以发言，只是为了避免人们误解他不支持美国的政策，有的人虽也不能不承认应认真考虑南日外务相的建议，有的虽也希望朝鲜问题应早日和平解决，但都跳不出杜勒斯圈定的联合国非法决议的圈子，毫无例外地提不出任何解决办法来。在这期间，举行了一次七国秘密会议，依然无助于会议的进展。杜勒斯在会议进行了一个星期之后，就在“美国外交的最大失败”声中离开日内瓦，代替他的史密斯并没有放松阻挠会议进展的幕后活动。时间一天天地飞逝，人们也知道在美国代表主持下的十六国会议断断续续地举行，但是他们忙碌的只是要拟订出一个欺骗世界舆论的方案来，以掩饰美国拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题的真面目。
    直至朝鲜问题开始讨论的二十七天之后，才由卞荣泰提出一个所谓十四点建议来。这个“建议”伪装得是这样拙劣，以致人们一望而知它只不过是联合国非法决议的具体化，就是要在所谓联合国的监督和批准之下，在美国军队的占领和保护之下，经过所谓“自由选举”，把李承晚政权扩展到北朝鲜去。这个“建议”在日内瓦所引起的反应，对于那些曾参预其事的人们是如此不利，以致他们赶忙否认这是十六国提案。法国代表团和英国代表团的发言人在二十二日举行记者招待会时，都说它只是南朝鲜的提案。以美国为首的西方国家代表们的这些行径，难道不是拖延而是促进日内瓦会议的进展吗？
    与此相反，参加日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题讨论的和平民主国家，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国以及苏联，在会议过程中一再努力促使会议达成协议。就在朝鲜问题的讨论停滞不前之际，周恩来外长于二十二日的会议上对南日外务相四月二十七日的方案提出一个补充建议，即组织中立国委员会来协助和监察举行全朝鲜选举。这个补充建议既尊重朝鲜人民自己处理自己事务的原则，又照顾了南北朝鲜长期对立的特殊情况，有助于双方意见的接近。但是美国和李承晚的代表又迫不及待地拒绝了这个补充建议，又一次表示他们追求的并不是使会议迅速达成协议，而是阻挠朝鲜问题的解决。
    朝鲜问题是如此，印度支那问题也是如此。恢复印度支那的和平是日内瓦会议的另一任务。在那里，战争仍继续进行，并且有因美国的日益加紧的干涉而扩大的严重危险。日内瓦会议对于印度支那问题的讨论本应尽早开始，但是美国和法国的代表们却接连采取了拖延的策略。最初，美国和法国的代表拒绝邀请越南民主共和国参加，使关于印度支那问题的讨论迟迟不能开始。其后，在同意邀请越南民主共和国参加讨论之后，会议本来定于五月六日开始，但法国方面又毫无理由地要求推迟两天。这样，世界人民迫切要求解决的印度支那问题比朝鲜问题迟了十二天才开始讨论。
    在会议开始后，皮杜尔总算提出了一个解决方案。但是这个方案只谈到了军事问题，完全撇开了政治问题，也就是说完全漠视印度支那人民的民族权利。而且在这个关于军事停战的方案中，法国以战胜者自居，提出了解散寮国和高棉抗战军队，消灭越南人民非正规武装等等片面的无理的条件，这自然不能说它真正希望印度支那问题迅速达成协议。
    与此相反，范文同提出了一个全面的、公平合理的建议。在这个建议中，不仅包括军事停战，而且包括政治解决；不仅符合印度支那人民的民族利益，而且照顾了法国经济文化的利益；不仅包括越南问题的解决，而且包括寮国和高棉问题的解决。这是越南民主共和国真诚希望和平解决问题的重大努力。但是在四次大会讨论过程中，美国、法国等代表一味否认范文同建议的合理性，固执地坚持他们的无理主张，致使会议停滞不前。
    为了促进会议的进展，苏联外长莫洛托夫于五月十四日对范文同的建议提出了两项补充，即：
  （一）组织中立国委员会协助和监督停战协议的实施；（二）与会各国共同保证停战协议的实施。越苏中三国的主动的努力，创造了使会议得以进入具体协商的良好条件。
    从五月十七日起讨论印度支那问题的秘密会议举行了。在第一次秘密会议上，美法等国代表们在讨论程序上，一再固执其无理主张，要求以皮杜尔的建议为讨论基础，拒绝讨论政治解决，只是到最后才同意了莫洛托夫的建议，即将范文同的方案和皮杜尔的方案合并讨论。不仅讨论军事停战，而且讨论政治解决；军事停战优先讨论。但是在第二次秘密会议上，美国和法国代表又节外生枝要求首先单独处理寮国和高棉问题。本来在一般辩论之初，越南民主共和国代表鉴于会议讨论的是整个印度支那问题，不仅包括越南而且包括寮国和高棉，因此曾建议邀请寮国和高棉两国抗战政府参加。但美、法等国代表悍然加以拒绝。周恩来外长为了使会议得以迅速进展，建议会议应听取寮国和高棉两国抗战政府代表的意见，但又遭到拒绝。现在美、法等国代表又无理地要求首先单独处理这两国的问题，即要求解散两国的抗战政府和军队，这就使秘密会议陷入费时无益的争论中。第二、第三两次秘密会议以及第四次秘密会议的大部分时间，就是消耗在由美、法等国代表挑起的这个问题的辩论中。只是到最后在这个无理要求遭到了越中苏三国代表的义正词严的批驳之后，美法英等国代表才不得不接受了莫洛托夫所提出的讨论程序和有关军事停战的五个问题。
    人们从这里不难看出关于印度支那问题的讨论是谁在拖延了时间。
    回顾日内瓦会议过去四个星期的工作，人们更清楚地看到美国代表及其追随者的政策是竭力阻挠日内瓦会议的进展。他们找寻一切机会来阻挠达成协议。杜勒斯和史密斯所追求的是要在日内瓦会议中证明协商不可能，以便于美国保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，继续和扩大印度支那战争，增加国际局势的紧张，推行其一再碰壁的“实力政策”。但是，人们也看到美国及其追随者的拖延和阻挠活动遭到和平民主国家的有力的反击，受到各国广大社会舆论的谴责。日内瓦会议正在艰难地但确实是一步一步地越过华盛顿当局所布置的路障，向前进展。
    现在，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论已因美国的阻挠而处于僵持中，关于印度支那问题的讨论，由于越苏中三国代表的努力已进入具体协商阶段。这里的观察家正纷纷议论，日内瓦会议的第五周工作有着决定性的意义。全世界爱好和平人民的任务就是再接再厉地击败美国及其追随者的阻挠和破坏，争取日内瓦会议达成对世界和平有重大意义的协议。   五月二十四日
