Workers in the forest areas of Northeast China are actively studying technology and have come up with many new creations and inventions. Since the launch of the labor competition, the workers of Langxiang Forest Railway have put forward many rationalization proposals. Zhao Yuzhang of the Shanhetun Forest Railway Machinery Factory created a "casting expansion ring machine," which increased work efficiency by 26 times. Gao Hongsheng and Yang Zhiyuan jointly created the "live-hearted turnout," which can save the country 140 million yuan of wealth a year. Qu Guoxing, a young worker in the machinery department of Tieli Forest Railway, quenched the turning tool with oil, increasing the number of wheelset tiles turned from 70 to 120 per day; then he changed the turning tool to a multi-edged one, increasing it to 250 per day. Qin Fuli, a fitter at Dunhua Central Machinery Factory, created a four-hole iron plate die, using a universal milling machine to process the lower cover of the German-style truck oil pack, which can continuously replace workpieces without stopping, increasing efficiency by 11.17 times compared to a shaper. Chen Yong, a locomotive worker at the 61st Lumber Mill of Tiansheng Lumber Bureau, made a "retarder" to prevent accidents caused by the large pulley running. All the workers of the second shift of the second large saw at the 44th Lumber Mill created a quick saw changing method, saving six minutes for each saw change, and 48 minutes a day.

    东北林区职工积极改进技术
    东北林区职工积极钻研技术，出现不少新的创造和发明。朗乡森林铁路职工从开展劳动竞赛以来，提出了许多合理化建议。山河屯森林铁路机械厂赵玉障创造“铸涨圈机”，提高工作效率二十六倍；高鸿升、杨志元共同创造“活心道岔”；一年可给国家节省一亿四千万元的财富。铁骊森林铁路机械部青工曲国兴将镟刀用油淬火，镟台车瓦由每天七十个提高到一百二十个；接着又把镟刀改成一刀多刃，提高到每天镟二百五十个。敦化中心机械厂钳工秦福利，创造四眼铁板胎，用万能铣床加工德式台车油包下盖，可以不停车循环换装工作物，比牛头刨效率提高十一点一七倍。田升制材局六十一制材厂机车工陈永，制出“缓车器”，防止了大带轮的跑车事故。四十四制材厂乙班二号大锯全体工人，创造快速换锯法，换一次锯就节省了六分钟，一天可节省四十八分钟。　（张庚午）
