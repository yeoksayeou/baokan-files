    The Vietnamese People Love President Ho Chi Minh
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Xiao Guang

    President Ho and the people,
    Like hands and feet,
    Like mortar and pestle,
    Like trunk and leaves.
    This little poem, widely circulated among the Vietnamese people, illustrates the close relationship between President Ho Chi Minh and the people. In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, one can hear the song "Ho Chi Minh Muon Nam (Long Live)" everywhere; and see that almost every household hangs a portrait of President Ho Chi Minh, with brightly colored oil paintings and watercolors, as well as portraits cut from newspapers. This old man with a broad forehead, sparkling eyes, and a kind smile always on his face, is affectionately and respectfully called "Uncle Ho" by the Vietnamese, young and old alike.

    President Ho Chi Minh is simple, humble, and learned. He loves his country and his people. For the liberation of Vietnam, he participated in secret anti-French colonial activities from his youth. For more than forty years afterwards he never ceased revolutionary struggle. He traveled overseas, traversing many countries. Abroad, hunger, poverty, and disease did not defeat him, and long-term detention, police tracking, and death sentences in absentia could not prevent him from continuing the struggle.

    On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at a rally of 500,000 people in Hanoi. That solemn declaration and the voice of justice stirred the hearts of the Vietnamese people.

    After the start of the all-out resistance war, President Ho Chi Minh moved from Hanoi to the deep mountains and forests of North Vietnam. Despite transportation blockades, every year and every month, thousands of letters from home and abroad, from liberated areas and French-occupied areas, crossed the oceans and blockade lines to reach President Ho Chi Minh. These letters spoke of the military exploits of the troops, new production records of workers and farmers, the work achievements of youth shock brigades, and also sent gifts: cloth shoes made by ethnic minorities, silk jackets sewn by Young Pioneers.... Cadres from various places also frequently brought greetings from the people to President Ho Chi Minh.

    Nguyen Huu Chi, an old man over sixty years old from Thai Nguyen province, dedicated all his children to the country: three children joined the army, and one worked in an ordnance factory. He himself joined the civilian labor team and cultivated four acres of land. When he was elected as a labor model of the commune (township) because of his good achievements in increasing production for patriotism, he excitedly wrote to report this to President Ho Chi Minh.

    A woman named Nguyen Thi Tran asked someone to bring two bottles of honey, earnestly requesting President Ho Chi Minh to accept them.

    The People's Army soldiers enthusiastically described everything on the battlefield to President Ho Chi Minh in their letters. In the South, a guerrilla fighter who used to be a painter was wounded. To alleviate the pain, before the medics came to apply medicine, he dipped his finger in blood and drew a portrait of President Ho Chi Minh on his clothes.

    During the Border Campaign, the People's Army soldiers firmly remembered President Ho Chi Minh's instruction to "fight to win" and bravely pursued and annihilated the French invading army, finally achieving a complete victory.

    The wounded and sick People's Army soldiers who remained in the rear for recuperation also did not forget "Uncle Ho's" teachings. They reclaimed wasteland, planted cassava, peanuts, and corn, raised chickens and ducks, and wove baskets and mats. They sent their products to President Ho Chi Minh, saying: We cannot go to the front line for the time being, but we guarantee to recuperate with peace of mind, actively produce, and fulfill the obligations of a citizen in the rear.

    The people in the French-occupied areas lived in dire straits. President Ho Chi Minh and the Lao Dong Party were their hope. Workers in Hanoi wrote in a letter to President Ho Chi Minh: The more we suffer, the more we miss "Uncle"; we believe that only you and the Lao Dong Party can liberate the Vietnamese people. We cannot see or hear your voice and smiling face, but your image is deeply engraved in our hearts. We assure "Uncle": We are always ready to sacrifice for the country.

    A young woman named Lin started working as a secret Party communicator at the age of fourteen. She was arrested seven times and subjected to various tortures. Once, she was electrocuted, her whole body was numb, and half of her hair fell out. But after each arrest, she cleverly escaped. On the anniversary of the birth of the Lao Dong Party, she wrote to tell President Ho Chi Minh: Although the enemy tortured me severely, I said nothing; I knew that saying it would be harmful to the resistance war. When I was tortured too badly, I thought of "Uncle," thought of the Party, and then I no longer felt pain. She said: In the future, I will work harder to be worthy of being a Vietnamese woman, a member of the Lao Dong Party, and a daughter of "Uncle Ho."

    After reading this letter, President Ho was moved and said to the people around him: This is the most precious gift I have received today.

    After the French army occupied the Hong Gai coal mine, they searched extensively for progressive books and materials. A copper coin engraved with President Ho Chi Minh's image was collected by a worker. He had collected it for many years, often taking it out to watch and caress it. The image on the coin was a bit blurry, so he decided to carve another one in the same way. He selected the best piece of coal essence and took it home, burying himself in carving late into the night, forgetting fatigue and danger. After more than half a year, he finally completed it. Later, the workers of the Hong Gai coal mine, in order to congratulate President Ho Chi Minh on his birthday, overcame numerous difficulties and presented the image to President Ho Chi Minh.

    The boundless love for the leader permeates the hearts of children in the same way.

    In the French prison in Saigon, not only adult victims were imprisoned, but also many children, some only seven or eight years old. Once, the guards intentionally put a portrait of President Ho Chi Minh on the ground, deceiving the children that they were being released. However, the first child who walked to the door silently stopped; the second knelt beside the portrait and kept kissing "Uncle Ho's" face; the third ran up and together with the first two children re-erected the fallen portrait. They would rather continue to be imprisoned than step on the portrait of their beloved leader to leave the prison.

    Overseas Chinese also always miss President Ho Chi Minh. They often write letters and send gifts to him; they hang the image of President Ho Chi Minh in the most prominent place in their homes. The Vietnamese people living abroad cannot often receive news from their motherland, and they often hear malicious slanders, but they firmly believe in the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh. A poem expressing this belief is spread among them:

    Although far away from the motherland,
    Our hearts are still in Vietnam,
    No matter how the enemy "propagates",
    It cannot shake our belief in "Uncle Ho".

### 越南人民热爱胡志明主席

    越南人民热爱胡志明主席
    新华社记者　萧光
    胡主席和人民，
    如手和足，
    如臼和杵，
    如树干和枝叶。
    在越南人民中间普遍流传的这首小诗，说明了胡志明主席和人民亲密的关系。在越南民主共和国，到处可以听到“胡志明莫南（万岁）”的歌声；又看到几乎是每户人家都挂着胡志明主席的肖像，有颜色鲜明的油画、水彩画，也有从报纸上剪下来的肖像。这位前额宽阔、眼睛炯炯发光和脸上永远露着慈祥微笑的老人，在越南不分老幼都亲热而尊敬地称呼他为“胡伯伯”。
    胡志明主席朴素、谦逊、博学。他热爱祖国和人民，为了越南的解放，他在少年时候起就参加秘密的反抗法国殖民者的活动，以后四十多年从未间断过革命斗争。他曾飘洋过海，走遍许多国家。在国外，饥饿、贫困和疾病都不曾把他折磨倒，长期的拘禁、警察的追踪以及缺席裁判的死刑判决也阻挠不了他进行斗争。
    一九四五年九月二日，胡志明主席在河内五十万群众的集会上宣告越南民主共和国的成立。那庄严的宣言，正义的声音，激动着越南人民的心。
    全面抗战开始以后，胡志明主席从河内移居到北越的大山林里。尽管交通阻塞，每年每月，国内外、解放区和法占区，成千封信越过海洋、越过封锁线送到胡志明主席的手中。这些信中说到部队的战功、工人和农民生产的新纪录、青年突击队的工作成绩，另外还送来礼物：少数民族做的布鞋、少年先锋队员自己缝制的绸褂子……。由各地来的干部也时常带来人民对胡志明主席的问候。
    太原省一位六十多岁的老人阮友志，他把孩子全都献给祖国了：三个孩子参军，一个在军火工厂工作。他自己参加了民工队，还耕种四亩田。当他因为爱国增产成绩好而被选为社（乡）的劳动模范的时候，他兴奋地把这些写信报告胡志明主席。
    妇女阮氏珍托人捎上两瓶蜂蜜，恳请胡志明主席一定收下。
    人民军战士们热情地在信上向胡志明主席叙述战场上的一切。在南部，一个曾是画家的游击队员负了伤，他为了减轻疼痛，在等卫生员来上药前，他用手指蘸着鲜血在衣服上画了一幅胡志明主席的像。
    边界战役中，人民军战士们牢牢地记住了胡志明主席“要打胜仗”的嘱咐，奋勇追歼法国侵略军，终于取得全胜。
    留在后方休养的人民军伤病员也忘记不了“胡伯伯”的教导。他们开垦荒地，栽种木薯、花生、玉蜀黍，喂养鸡鸭，编织箩筐和席子。他们把自己的产品送给胡志明主席，说：我们暂时不能上前线，但保证安心休养，积极生产，完成一个后方公民的义务。
    法占区的人民生活在水深火热中，胡志明主席和劳动党就是他们的希望。河内的工人在给胡志明主席的信中写道：我们越痛苦就越想念“伯伯”；相信只有您和劳动党才能解放越南人民。看不见和听不到您的音容笑貌，但您的形象已深深刻印在我们的心中。我们向“伯伯”保证：时刻准备为祖国牺牲。
    一个名叫林的女青年，十四岁起就开始担任党的秘密通讯员，她被捕七次，受过种种酷刑。有一回，她受电刑，全身麻木，头发脱掉了一半。但在每一次被捕后，她都巧妙地逃脱出来。在劳动党的诞生纪念日那天，她写信告诉胡志明主席：尽管敌人严刑拷打，我什么也不说；我知道说出来就有害抗战。当被拷打得太厉害的时候，我就想“伯伯”、想党，这样我就不再感到疼痛了。她说：今后我要更加努力，以不愧为一个越南女青年、一个劳动党员、一个“胡伯伯”的女儿。
    念完这封信，胡主席感动地对周围的人说：这是我今天收到的最贵重的礼物。
    法军占领鸿基煤矿以后，大肆搜查进步书报和材料。有一枚刻有胡志明主席像的铜币被一位工人收藏起来了。他收藏了好几年，不时拿出来观看、抚摩。铜币上面的像有些模糊了，他决定依样另刻一个。他选了一块最好的煤精带回家去，每天晚上埋头刻到深夜，忘了疲倦和危险。过了半年多终于完成了。以后，鸿基煤矿的工人为了祝贺胡志明主席的寿辰，克服了重重困难，把这个像献给了胡志明主席。
    对于领袖的无限热爱，同样地浸透着少年儿童的心。
    在西贡的法国监狱里，不仅关禁着成年的受难者，还有许多少年儿童，有的只有七、八岁。有一次，守狱的人有意把一幅胡志明主席的画像放倒在地上，欺骗孩子们说释放他们了。但是，第一个走到门口的孩子默默地站住了；第二个跪倒在画像旁边不断亲吻“胡伯伯”的脸；第三个跑上去和前两个孩子一道把倒下的像重新竖起。他们宁愿继续坐牢，也不肯踏着心爱的领袖像出狱。
    海外的侨民也时刻怀念胡志明主席。他们时常写信和寄礼物给他；把胡志明主席的像挂在家中最显著的地方。侨居国外的越南人民不能经常收到祖国的讯息，又常听到恶意的造谣中伤，但他们坚信胡志明主席的领导。有一首表达他们这种信念的诗在他们中间传布：
    虽然离开祖国很远，
    我们的心呀还在越南，
    任凭敌人怎么“宣传”，
    不能动摇我们对“胡伯伯”的信念。
