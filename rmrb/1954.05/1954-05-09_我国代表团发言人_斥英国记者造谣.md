Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 7th: The British "Manchester Guardian" published a report on May 5th by its journalist, stating that the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, in a private meeting with Mr. Myrdal, Secretary-General of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, hinted that the Chinese delegation was prepared to consider a ceasefire along the 20th parallel in Indochina, provided that this could be part of a broader agreement including expanded trade between China and the West. In response, the spokesperson of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China stated that the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Lei Renmin, had never met with Mr. Myrdal, and therefore the aforementioned report was purely fabricated.

    我国代表团发言人
    斥英国记者造谣
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】英国“曼彻斯特卫报”五月五日刊载该报记者报道，中国对外贸易部副部长在和联合国欧洲经济委员会秘书长密达尔先生私下会谈中，暗示中国代表团准备考虑在印度支那沿着北纬二十度停战，只要这能作为一个包含扩充中国与西方贸易的较为广泛的协议的一部分。对此，中华人民共和国代表团发言人声称：中国对外贸易部副部长雷任民从未会见过密达尔先生，因此上述报道纯属虚构。
