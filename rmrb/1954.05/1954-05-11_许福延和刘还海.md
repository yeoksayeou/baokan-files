Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai

　　In the old society, apprentices waited for their masters to retire, much like daughters-in-law waited for their mothers-in-law to die. If someone were to say that an apprentice has become a level-two artisan in three months, people would surely ask: Did this apprentice work in a factory before? Or is he a graduate of some university? Otherwise, is the master an engineer? None of these are true. The master is just a level-five milling and lathe worker, and the apprentice indeed became a level-two artisan in three months. This pair of master and apprentice both work in the machine shop of the repair department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory. The master's name is Xu Fuyan, and the apprentice's name is Liu Haihai.

　　The First Lesson

　　One day at noon, Liu Haihai bought four meat buns at the canteen, ate two, and took the other two into the workshop. "Master Xu, have two buns." Xu Fuyan looked up and then down again, smiling. He said, "I'm not hungry."

　　After work, the master called the apprentice to his home and said:

　　"When I left home, my mother told me, 'Child, remember your mother's words: rely on your parents at home, rely on friends when you're away from home…'" "Yes, my mother told me the same." "Giving me buns to eat was also your mother's idea, right?" Liu Haihai laughed, and Xu Fuyan continued, "When we were apprentices, we practically had to steal techniques. When the master was around, you couldn't even touch the machine. Back then, the workers and the factory were two separate families, and the master and apprentice weren't of one mind either. Now it's a new society, and you and I are both masters of the factory. The better you are, the more you are the master of the factory. But those who have never been slaves don't know how wonderful it is to be the master. New factories are appearing every day, but there aren't enough skilled people. Machines are getting newer every day, but you can't use them if your skills aren't high enough. For a master to be a good master is to completely share their techniques, which is being responsible to the country. I'm happier than eating meat buns if you quickly master the techniques."

　　5:30 AM

　　Just as dawn broke, the sound of disassembling machines came from the machine shop. Who was coming to work so early? It was Xu Fuyan, who had opened up a machine to explain its structure to Liu Haihai.

　　The Youth League branch called for the signing of master-apprentice contracts, and Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai were the first to respond. After the master-apprentice contract was signed, the Youth League branch secretary said to Xu Fuyan, "Quickly teach your apprentice; this is the League's test for you." Xu Fuyan was very worried: "Can it be done in three months? What method can be used to speed it up?" At this time, he recalled his own apprenticeship: for a year or two, all he did was pour oil and wipe machines. Day after day passed, and he was still himself, and the machine was still the machine. After a long time, he began to see how things worked. When the master went to urinate, he would quickly stand on the machine, pick up the hand crank, and his heart would beat "thump, thump." Just as he was about to start working, the master would come back: "Don't you dare touch it! If you damage a piece, my two catties of red sorghum will be gone!"

　　Xu Fuyan came to a realization: "Now I'll let go and let him be bold."

　　"Letting him be bold" was not easy; to do the work, he had to understand the machine's structure first. One day after work, Xu Fuyan drew a simplified diagram of a milling machine on the ground and said to Liu Haihai, "Look, this is a gear…" Liu Haihai stared with wide eyes and asked, "What is a gear?" Xu Fuyan frowned and paused for a moment, then said, "Come at 5:30 tomorrow morning, and we'll open up the machine and talk about it." The next morning, Xu Fuyan pointed to the machine and explained everything from the motor, belt, and gears to the milling cutter. The master asked the apprentice:

　　"Do you understand?" The apprentice said, "I understand. There are eleven spur gears and two helical gears inside." The master said, "You're really smart. I've been working for several years, and I haven't even remembered how many there are in total. By teaching you, I've also increased my knowledge."

　　"There's a Method"

　　Although Xu Fuyan had made up his mind to "let go," he was still a little worried when the time came. "It's only been twenty-odd days since the master-apprentice contract was signed. Should I dare to give him these twelve shafts to work on?" So he said to the apprentice:

　　"If you can't mill a whole shaft, mill half a shaft. Be careful, and don't ruin the work."

　　Xu Fuyan's body was at the meeting, but his mind was thinking about his apprentice. When he came back in the afternoon, he saw that all twelve shafts had been milled. Xu Fuyan was shocked and hurriedly took the calipers to measure, and they all met the specifications. He was really overjoyed. But he thought: This young man is really clever and bold. Shouldn't he be complacent after doing this work? After work, Xu Fuyan called the apprentice to his home and said to him, "You've got the hang of it. From now on, as long as you're careful, you won't ruin the work."

　　"Just the Beginning"

　　Xu Fuyan's estimation was correct. Liu Haihai developed a "disease."

　　In the two tests after the master-apprentice contract was signed, Liu Haihai got first place. The master saw clearly that the apprentice had changed: he no longer listened attentively, and he didn't carry a notebook in his pocket anymore. The master was the "doctor" and diagnosed that the apprentice's disease was complacency. If this disease couldn't be cured, he wouldn't learn in three months, let alone half a year. "Haihai, let me see your notebook." The apprentice didn't speak and blushed, stammering for a while before saying, "I forgot to bring it." Xu Fuyan said, "Bring your notebook to my house tonight."

　　He did have a notebook, but he hadn't written anything in it for the past two days. When Xu Fuyan saw Liu Haihai's embarrassed look, he knew that the apprentice had already admitted his mistake, so he said to him: "The Party and the League often educate us to study hard. When you stand on the machine, learning techniques is just the beginning. The little bit of knowledge you've learned is less than what the old masters have forgotten! Many labor models have achieved far greater results than us, and they are still working hard to learn. We should study even harder."

　　Find Difficulties, Overcome Difficulties

　　The work section leader gave Xu Fuyan a batch of work milling inclined keyways on small screws. Xu Fuyan assigned the work to Liu Haihai. These were small screws less than two inches long, each of which needed to have a crescent-shaped groove milled on it. It was quite difficult to mount them, and Liu Haihai was covered in sweat but still couldn't hold them securely. He went to Xu Fuyan and said, "Master, I can't do this work." Xu Fuyan said, "Think of another way." Liu Haihai's eyes flickered, and he thought of a crooked idea: "It's almost time to get off work, let the next shift do it." He looked here, touched there, and as soon as the whistle blew, he ran out of the workshop.

　　When he came to work the next day, he saw that the small screws were still in their original places. Xu Fuyan came over and said to Liu Haihai, "Youth League members can't be afraid of difficulties. This batch of work must be finished today." The master's attitude was very firm, so Liu Haihai stood on the machine and worked all the way until it was time to get off work. While eating dinner, Liu Haihai ran to Xu Fuyan's house, jumping and skipping: "Master Xu, the inclined keyways are milled!" The master said, "Nothing is difficult in the world, but you can't be afraid of difficulties. If you run away from difficulties, that difficulty will still be there ten years from now. Learning techniques is about finding difficulties, and overcoming difficulties improves your skills."

　　All Are Masters

　　The master was right, learning techniques requires finding difficulties and overcoming difficulties. But how to overcome them? Rely on yourself? Or rely on everyone?

　　The five items stipulated in the master-apprentice contract had already been more than four-fifths completed. Both master and apprentice were delving deeply. When the two were studying how to grind milling cutters, Xu Fuyan said to Liu Haihai, "I started as a planing machine operator, then learned milling machine operation halfway. I'm an amateur when it comes to grinding knives. Master Shi and Master Liang have good knife-grinding skills. I often ask them for advice. You should go learn from them too!" Some people, upon hearing this, said, "Why is your apprentice learning from others?" Xu Fuyan said, "Taking on apprentices is to improve production, and improving production is everyone's glory. If the masters only care about their own face, the apprentices will learn very slowly."

　　Following his master's instructions, Liu Haihai learned knife grinding from Master Shi and Master Liang, and learned gear conversion from Master Wang. ...

　　New Record

　　Liu Haihai was able to operate the milling machine independently in less than three months after joining the planing machine group in the machine shop and was promoted to a level-two worker. In less than a year, he improved the operating methods and created a new production record.

　　One day, the milling machine group received an urgent task: milling grooves on small bamboo-joint steel rollers (250 grooves on each roller). The group leader assigned this task to Liu Haihai and two others. This kind of work would make even level-four or five artisans frown, let alone a novice like Liu Haihai.

　　Liu Haihai put a lot of thought into solving the problem of the rollers not being secure. He milled the grooves on the first roller and did the math: it took 28 hours and 42 knives. He shook his head and said to himself, "No, it's still too slow!"

　　Starting on the second roller, Liu Haihai sat on a copper tile next to the lathe, his hands on his cheeks, his eyes watching the lathe. The problem was finally discovered: the most time-consuming thing was controlling the depth. Using a 30-millimeter diameter knife to cut a 3.5-millimeter deep groove, it couldn't be too deep or too shallow. After cutting one groove, he would measure it with a template. Sometimes it took three or four cuts to mill one groove, and he had to stop the machine every time he used the template to measure. Liu Haihai found a 27-millimeter diameter nut and pressed it under the knife head. He tried it, and when the knife hit the roller at the nut, it was exactly a 3.5-millimeter deep groove. He was extremely happy and milled all 250 grooves in one go. He measured them, and they all met the specifications. Liu Haihai did the math again: it took 2 minutes and 50 seconds to mill the second roller and only used two knives.

　　"Technology Research Institute"

　　One day, Liu Haihai went to Xu Fuyan. As soon as he entered the door, he said, "Master Xu, the *Shanxi Daily* has published our story, have you seen it?" Xu Fuyan said "Hmm." Liu Haihai saw that things didn't seem right and quickly asked, "Are you unhappy?"

　　"No. I've been thinking about this for the past few days: we've only done such a small thing, and the leaders are praising us and publishing it in the newspaper. We must work even harder in the future. That old habit of yours, I've told you several times and you still can't change it. In the future, you must first see the advantages of others and learn from them. ... I also have many shortcomings. In the past, I didn't discuss problems with other comrades enough, and I always worked alone. I didn't help my apprentices Chai Sheng'en and Wang Shenyi enough. In fact, what kind of contribution is it to teach one apprentice well! Teaching more apprentices well is the most important thing!"

　　Liu Haihai said to his master in a respectful manner, "I guarantee I will change my shortcomings. I will go talk to Chai Sheng'en and them." Looking at his apprentice's adorable appearance, Xu Fuyan smiled.

　　Soon, Xu Fuyan's home practically became a research institute. Every Sunday, all three of his apprentices would come, either to study techniques or to help others realize tricks. Gradually, many level-four and five artisans also came to participate in this research association. They helped Chai Sheng'en realize a trick, increasing the efficiency of milling automatic switches by two and a half times. After Xu Fuyan's two rationalization proposals were researched and implemented by everyone, milling the change keyway on a bent plate increased efficiency two times, and milling copper wire clips was reduced from two hours per piece to twenty minutes per piece. Recently, they have also been researching Xu Fuyan and Liu Haihai's proposal: to try to manufacture a milling machine workbench to solve the problem of equipment imbalance in the entire workshop.

    许福延和刘还海
    贯之  占敖
    旧社会里徒弟熬师傅，好比旧社会的媳妇熬婆婆。如果说现在有个学徒三个月就变成了二级工匠，一定有人要问：这徒弟过去在工厂干过吧？或者他一定是什么高等学校的毕业生？要不然师傅一定是个工程师了？这些都不对，师傅只是一个五级铣车匠，徒弟确是在三个月学成了二级工匠，这一对师徒都在太原钢铁厂修造部机工场工作，师傅叫许福延，徒弟叫刘还海。
    第一课
    一天中午，刘还海在食堂买了四个肉包子，吃了两个，拿着两个进了车间。“许师傅，吃两个包子吧。”许福延抬起头又低下去，笑了。他说道：“我不饿。”
    下班后，师傅把徒弟叫到家里，对徒弟说：
  “我从家出来的时候，妈对我说，孩子，记着娘的话：在家靠父母，出门靠朋友……”“对，我妈也这么说过。”“给我包子吃也是你妈告诉的吧？”刘还海笑了，许福延接着说：“我们学徒的时候，简直是偷技术，师傅在，你休想摸床子。那时工人和工厂是两家人，师傅和徒弟也就不一心。现在是新社会，你和我都是工厂的主人。你有多好，进工厂就是主人。可是没有当过奴隶的人，就不知道当主人的味道有多美。新工厂一天比一天多，可是人材不够用，机器一天比一天新，技术不高就不能使唤。当师傅的作好主人就是把技术全盘端出来，这是对国家负责。你很快掌握了技术，我比吃肉包子还高兴。”
      早晨五点半
    天刚亮，机工场就传出了拆卸机器的声音。谁这么早上班呢？是许福延打开机器在给刘还海讲铣车构造。
    团支部号召签订师徒合同，头一个响应的是许福延和刘还海。订罢了师徒合同，团支部书记对许福延说：“很快地教会徒弟，这是团对你的考验。”许福延很发愁：“三个月能行吗？用啥办法可以快一点呢？”这时他想起了当年学徒时的情形：一两年都是浇油、擦机器，一天一天的过去了，自己是自己，机器还是机器。天长日久看得有了门，师傅去小便，急忙站上床子，拿起摇手把，心里“扑通、扑通”的跳，正想工作，师傅回来了：“不敢动，动坏一件我的二斤红高粱就完了！”
  　许福延想开了：“现在我放开手，让他大胆干。”
      “让他大胆干”，可并不容易，要干就得先懂得机器构造。一天下了班，许福延在地下划了个铣车简图，对刘还海说：“看，这是齿轮，……”刘还海瞪着两眼问道：“啥叫齿轮呀？”许福延眉头一皱，呆了一会说：“你明天早晨五点半来吧，咱们打开机器讲。”第二天早晨，许福延手指着机器，从电动机、皮带、齿轮一直讲到铣刀。师傅问徒弟：
  “明白了吗？”徒弟说：“知道了，里头有十一个正齿轮，两个斜齿轮。”师傅说：“你真聪明，我干了几年也没记清共有几个，教会你我也增长了知识。”
    “有门了”
    虽然许福延已下定决心“放开手”，可是事到临头他又有点不放心。“订师徒合同才二十多天，敢不敢把这十二根轴交给他干呢？”于是对徒弟说：
  “铣不完一根铣半根，多用点心，不要坏了活。”
    许福延身在开会，心在想徒弟。下午回来一看，十二根轴都铣完了，许福延心里一惊，急忙拿着卡具去测量，全部合乎规格。他真是喜出望外。可是他想：小伙子真够机灵，胆子也不小，干出这些活不要自满吧？下班后许福延把徒弟叫到家里，对他说：“你学得有门了，从今后只要操心，就不会干坏活。”
      “刚刚开始”
    许福延估计得不错，刘还海有了“病”。
    师徒合同签订后的两次测验，刘还海都得了第一名。师傅看得很清，徒弟变了：聚精会神听讲的样子没有了，兜儿里也不带笔记本了。师傅是“医生”，诊断出徒弟的病是自满情绪。这病治不好，不用说三个月，就是半年也学不成。“还海，把你的笔记本给我看看。”徒弟没说话就红了脸，吱唔了一阵才说：“忘记拿了。”许福延说：“晚上你拿上笔记本到我家去。”
    笔记本倒是有，就是这两天没记下东西。许福延看见刘还海那股难受劲儿，就知道徒弟已经认错了，就对他说：“党和团常教育我们要好好学习，你站上床子，学技术才是刚刚开始，学下的那点东西还没有老师傅们丢了的多呢！许多劳动模范比我们的成绩大得多，人家还在努力学习，我们更要好好学才是。”
    找困难，战胜困难
    工段长把铣小螺丝上斜键槽的一批活交给了许福延。许福延把活儿分给了刘还海。这是一些不到二寸长的小螺丝，每个上边都要铣一道月牙形的槽。上活挺费劲，刘还海出了一头汗也没把住。他去找许福延说道：“师傅，这活儿我干不了。”许福延说：“再想想办法。”刘还海两只大眼一“忽闪”，想了个歪办法：“快下班了，让下一班干吧。”他看看这，摸摸那，汽笛一响，就跑出了车间。
    第二天上班一看，谁知道小螺丝还在原地方摆着。许福延过来了，就对刘还海说：“青年团员不能怕困难，这批活儿今天一定干完。”师傅的态度很坚决，刘还海就站上床子，一气干到下班。吃晚饭的时候，刘还海连蹦带跳的跑到许福延家里：“许师傅，斜键槽铣完了。”师傅说：“天下无难事，就是不能怕困难；碰到困难你就溜了，再过十年还是那个困难。学技术就是找困难，克服了困难就提高了技术。”
    都是师傅
    师傅说得对，学技术要找困难，要克服困难。可是怎样克服呢？靠自己呢？还是靠大家呢？
    师徒合同内规定的五项内容，已经完成了四项多。师徒二人都在深钻。两个人在研究磨铣刀的时候，许福延对刘还海说：“开头我是个刨车匠，半路学铣车，磨刀的活儿我是外行，石师傅和梁师傅磨刀的手艺好，我常请教他们，你也去找他们学吧！”有些人听了这话，就说道：“你的徒弟为啥跟别人学呢！”许福延说：“带徒弟是为搞好生产，搞好生产是大家的光荣。师傅们只顾自己的面子，徒弟就带得很慢。”
    刘还海按着师傅的吩咐，找石师傅、梁师傅学磨刀，找王师傅学齿轮换算。………
      新纪录
    刘还海到机工场刨车组不到三个月就能上铣床单独操作了，并被提升为二级工人。不到一年，他改进操作方法，创造了生产新纪录。
    有一天铣车组接到一个紧急任务：铣小型竹节钢轧辊上的槽子（每根轧辊二百五十个槽）。组长把这个任务交给刘还海等三个人来干，这种活，别说是让刘还海这个生手来干，就是四、五级的工匠见了它也要皱眉头。
    刘还海费了很多心思，解决了轧辊不牢的问题。他把第一根轧辊的槽子铣完了，算了一下账：用了二十八个钟头，打了四十二把刀。他摇了摇头，自言自语地说：“不行，还是太慢！”
    上起第二根轧辊，刘还海一屁股坐在车床旁边的铜瓦上，两手托着腮，两只眼睛望着车床，问题终于被发现了：最费时间的是掌握深度，直径三十公厘的刀，车三点五公厘深的槽子，深不得，浅不得，车一刀，用样板量一量，有时三、四刀才能铣一个槽，每用样板量一次，就得停一次车。刘还海找了个直径二十七公厘的螺丝帽按在刀头下，试了一下，当车到螺丝帽碰到轧辊时，正好是一个三点五公厘深的槽子。他高兴极了，一股气把二百五十个槽子铣完。量了一下，全部合乎规格。刘还海又算了一下账：铣第二根轧辊用了两点五十分钟，只用了两把刀。
    “技术研究所”
    有一天，刘还海去找许福延。一进门就说：“许师傅，山西日报上登出咱们的事来了，你看过吗？”许福延“嗯”了一声。刘还海看见势头不对，忙追问：“你不高兴吗？”
      “不是。这几天来我就想：咱们只做了那么一小点事情，领导上表扬，又登报。咱们以后更要好好干啦。你那个老毛病，说了几次也改不掉。以后一定要先看到别人的优点，向人家学习。……我也有许多缺点，过去和别的同志研究问题少，老是一个人钻；对徒弟柴盛恩、王慎义帮助不够。其实，教好一个徒弟算什么贡献呢！教好更多的徒弟，那才顶大事呢！”
    刘还海规规矩矩地对师傅说：“我的缺点我保证改掉。我去找柴盛恩他们谈谈。”看着徒弟那种可爱的样子，许福延笑了。
    不久，许福延的家里简直变成了个研究所，每逢星期日，他的三个徒弟就都来了，不是研究技术，就是帮助别人实现窍门。慢慢地，许多四、五级的工匠们也来参加这个研究会了。他们帮助柴盛恩实现了一个窍门，铣自动开关提高效率两倍半；许福延的两条合理化建议经大家研究实现后，一次铣弯板上的改键槽提高效率二倍，又一次铣铜线卡，由两小时铣一件降低到二十分钟铣一件。最近他们又在研究许福延、刘还海的一条建议：试制铣车工作台，解决全车间的设备不平衡问题。
