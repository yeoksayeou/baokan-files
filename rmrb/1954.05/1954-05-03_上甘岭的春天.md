    The Spring of Shangganling
    Liu Fangyang
    Spring has come to the Korean front. The snow on the Shangganling mountains has long melted, and the land overturned by artillery shells has sprouted green grass. New, green buds are emerging from the spring tree stumps covered with bullet marks. Spring is changing the face of the Shangganling position.
    The row of new houses newly built along the north side of Shangganling after the armistice has now been cleaned up, and the board walls or mud walls blackened by burning the kang in winter have been plastered with posters and white newsprint, arranged neatly and beautifully. The wall newspapers made of large oilcloth at the entrance of each class have also been renewed, and all the newspaper titles are written with "Huang Jiguang Direction Report." The fonts of the newspaper titles of each class are different, the sizes vary, and some are painted with various colors, which are fresh and eye-catching. The roads leading to each housing unit are paved with a layer of sand and gravel, wide and flat. The soldiers planted many small pine trees along the road. On the hillside near the club, the soldiers have opened up a new piece of land, ready to grow vegetables. They also plan to open up several flower gardens of different sizes near the barracks. Not far from the northern boundary marker of the Demilitarized Zone, on a grassy hillside, the soldiers embedded the huge characters "Shangganling New Village" with gravel.
    A year ago, this place was still filled with smoke and riddled with shell craters. The soldiers greeted the spring in the tunnels with new victories in combat. Now, as the soldiers create a better position life under the spring sunshine, everyone's face can't help but show a spring smile. After the soldiers studied the General Line, they became particularly concerned about the construction of the motherland, and their position life became richer. As soon as the newspapers arrive, no matter where they are, the soldiers always scramble to read all the good news about the construction of the motherland. When the soldiers from Hubei Province heard the news that the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge had started construction, they were busy writing letters home to inquire whether any acquaintances were participating in this great project. Deputy Platoon Leader Wu Taikuan discovered a thick layer of asbestos in the hard rock layer. He carefully peeled off pieces one by one and collected them together, smiling so wide that he couldn't close his mouth. He said to the soldiers, "Let's send the asbestos to Anshan to show our concern for the construction of our worker brothers!"
    The spring breeze brought more messages from the motherland to Shangganling. These days, the position receives dozens of letters from the motherland every day, including family letters and other letters. Some fathers tell their sons that their families have joined agricultural production cooperatives; some wives report the spring plowing production plans to their husbands. Similarly, more letters have been sent to the motherland these days. Many of the soldiers' assignments received by the cultural instructor are drafts of letters to the motherland. During free time in the afternoon, the sounds of playing ball, singing, and dancing outside are noisy, but Zhong Dehua, a seventeen-year-old soldier from Sichuan, lies on a small stool at the door to do his homework. He wrote in his homework book: "Sister Shuqing, I am very happy that you have studied the General Line and joined the cooperative..." When Zhong Dehua joined the army, his sixteen-year-old fiancée Shuqing personally sent him to the ship. They made a wish to each other: "Never change our hearts." This sentence has taken root in the hearts of this young couple, and each communication gives them a lot of comfort and encouragement. This young soldier, who is not tall but quite sturdy, is full of red light and flashes his dark eyes. He always hums a tune from his hometown when he works. He said: "Those who lead the way are working hard, and good days are waiting for us!" The love for the bright future of the motherland has added glory to the love between the volunteer soldiers and the rural girls.
    Welcoming the spring of peace on this heroic position, the soldiers feel more and more the preciousness of peaceful life. Opposite the mountain is the place where martyr Huang Jiguang sacrificed, and under our feet is the tunnel where we fought bloody battles for forty days and nights. Every inch of land and every stone here is permeated with the blood of the martyrs. Who can forget this? Standing on the high mountain on the northern edge of the Demilitarized Zone, listening to the songs and laughter of labor behind him, thinking about the socialist prospects of the motherland, and looking at the enemy in front of him - on the other side, tanks have been driven into the Demilitarized Zone, and helicopters are buzzing and disappearing in the mountain mist behind the sun - how can we not be more vigilant in guarding the position! Everything around us is telling our soldiers that the spring of peace must be maintained with the power to defend peace! After the snow melted, each sentry post demarcated its new surveillance range, and new azimuth objects were also designated on every road in the Demilitarized Zone. When sleeping at night, the guns are placed next to the heads, and everyone has a pair of light single shoes ready for battle under their bags. In the morning, when the lurking sentries sent out last night return with the joy of victory, the soldiers' backpacks have been packed as neatly as tofu blocks and placed neatly on their kangs. They proudly said: "As long as the enemy dares to tear up the armistice agreement, we can give the enemy a head-on blow at any time!" (Attached picture)

    上甘岭的春天
    刘芳扬
    春天来到了朝鲜前线。上甘岭山头上的积雪早已融化，炮弹打翻了的土地上，已经长出了青草，布满弹痕的春树桩上，也冒出了发绿的新芽。春天在改变着上甘岭阵地的面貌。
    沿上甘岭北山停战后新盖起来的一排新屋，现在已打扫得干干净净，被冬天烧炕熏黑了的板壁或泥墙，都糊上了画报和白报纸，布置得又整齐又美观。各班门口用大油布制成的墙报，现在也换上了新装，所有的报头都同样写着：“黄继光方向报”，各班的报头字体不同，大小不一，有的还涂上了各种颜色，清新夺目。通往各个住房的道路，都铺上了一层砂石，宽阔而又平坦。战士们在路旁种了许多小松树。俱乐部附近的半山坡上，战士已经开出了一片新土，准备种菜。他们还计划在营房的附近开辟几个大小不同的花圃。在距非军事区北缘界牌不远处，青草覆盖的山坡上，战士们用碎石嵌上巨大的“上甘岭新村”字样。
    一年以前，这里还是硝烟弥漫，弹坑累累，战士们在坑道中用新的战斗的胜利来迎接春天。而现在，当战士们在春天阳光的底下创造更美好的阵地生活的时候，每个人的脸上不由地都泛起了春天的笑容。战士们自学了总路线后，由于对祖国的建设特别关心，阵地生活也更加丰富起来了。只要报纸一到，不论在那里，凡是祖国建设的喜讯，战士们总要抢着通通读完。湖北籍的战士听到武汉长江大铁桥开工的消息，就忙着写信回家打听有熟人参加这个大工程没有。副排长吴太宽在坚石层里发现了很厚的石棉，他细心地一块一块剥下来收拾在一起，笑得嘴都合不拢，他向战士们说：“我们把石棉寄到鞍山去，作为我们关心工人老大哥建设的心意！”
    春风给上甘岭带来了祖国更多的讯息。这几天，阵地上每天都要收到数十封来自祖国的家信和其他信件。有的父亲告诉儿子，家中已参加了农业生产合作社；有的妻子向自己的丈夫报告春耕生产的计划。同样，这几天向祖国发出的信件也更多了。文化教员收到的战士作业有许多都是向祖国写信的草稿。下午自由活动的时候，外面打球的、唱歌的、跳舞的嚷成一片，而十七岁的四川籍战士锺德华却爬在门口的小凳子上写作业，他在作业本上写着：“淑清妹妹，你学了总路线，参加了合作社，我非常高兴……”锺德华参军的时候，他的十六岁的未婚妻淑清亲自把他送到轮船上，他俩互相许下了心愿：“永远不变心。”这一句话在这一对年轻人的心里已生下了根，每次通信，都使他们互相得到不少安慰和鼓舞。这位个子不大、却挺结实的青年战士，满面红光，闪着乌黑的眼睛，干起活来老是哼着家乡的小调，他说：“带头的干呵，好日子在等着我们呢！”对祖国美好的将来的热爱，使志愿军战士和农村姑娘的爱情，也增添了光辉。
    在这个英雄阵地上迎接和平的春天，战士们愈加感到和平生活的可贵。对面山上就是黄继光烈士牺牲的地方，脚下就是曾经血战过四十昼夜的坑道，这里的每一寸土地、每一块石头都渗透着先烈们的鲜血，谁能忘记这个呢？站在非军事区北缘高山上的哨兵，听着背后劳动的歌声和笑声，想着祖国社会主义的远景，望着前面的敌人—在那边，坦克一直开到了非军事区，直升飞机嗡嗡地隐没在背着阳光的山雾中，如何能不加倍警惕地守卫阵地呢！周围的一切，都在告诉我们的战士，和平的春天是要用保卫和平的力量来维护的啊！积雪溶化以后，每一个岗哨都划定了自己新的监视范围，在非军事区的每一条通路上，也指定了新的方位物。晚上睡觉的时候，枪枕在头边，每一个人的包袱底下都放了一双准备战斗的轻便单鞋。早晨，当昨夜放出去的潜伏哨，扬着胜利的喜悦回来的时候，战士们的背包已经打得像豆腐块一样，整整齐齐放在自己的炕上。他们骄傲地说：“只要敌人胆敢撕毁停战协定，我们在任何时刻都能给敌人以迎头痛击！”（附图片）
