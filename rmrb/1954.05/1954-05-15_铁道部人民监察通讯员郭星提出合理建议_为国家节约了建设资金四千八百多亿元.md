    Railway Ministry People's Supervision Correspondent Guo Xing Proposes Reasonable Suggestion
    Saving the Nation Over 480 Billion Yuan in Construction Funds

    [By Our Own Correspondent] Guo Xing, a People's Supervision Correspondent from the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, put forward a reasonable suggestion that saved the country more than 480 billion yuan. The Central Railway Ministry originally planned to build a broad-gauge railway in a certain area, with a total length of more than 300 kilometers. To build a broad-gauge railway, the line needs to be widened, and the amount of earthwork, ballast, and sleepers required will increase significantly; in the future, a considerable number of locomotives, vehicles, transshipment stations, and various repair factories will also be required for transportation. In addition, a considerable number of broad-gauge railway management personnel will also be needed. Guo Xing, a People's Supervision Correspondent from the Design Bureau of the Central Railway Ministry, calculated that this would cost 503 billion yuan more than using standard gauge, and in the future, the equipment capacity would not be fully utilized, resulting in waste in transportation. Therefore, Guo Xing reported this situation to the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council through the People's Supervision Office of the Ministry of Railways, suggesting that this railway be rebuilt as standard gauge. After the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council forwarded the matter to relevant leaders for research, it was deemed that Guo Xing's opinion was reasonable and his suggestion was adopted. Construction of the broad-gauge line was immediately stopped. In this way, in addition to the broad-gauge project that has already been completed, future modification to standard gauge will save the country 480 billion yuan in funds.

    铁道部人民监察通讯员郭星提出合理建议
    为国家节约了建设资金四千八百多亿元
    【本报讯】中央人民政府铁道部设计局人民监察通讯员郭星提出一项合理建议，给国家节省四千八百多亿元。中央铁道部原计划在某地区修建宽轨铁路一条，线路全长三百多公里。修建宽轨铁路，线路就要加宽，所需土石方、石碴、枕木等器材用量就要加多加大；并且将来在运输上还要有相当的机车、车辆、换装站以及各种修理工厂。此外，还要有相当数量的宽轨铁路管理人员。中央铁道部设计局人民监察通讯员郭星计算了一下，这样比标准轨要多用五千零三十亿元，将来在运输上还会因设备力量不能充分发挥而造成浪费。于是，郭星将这种情况通过铁道部人民监察室反映给政务院人民监察委员会，建议将这条铁路改建为标准轨。经政务院人民监察委员会转请有关领导方面研究，认为郭星的意见是合理的，采纳了他的意见，立即停止了宽轨线路的施工。这样除了已完竣的宽轨工程外，今后改修标准轨就能给国家节省资金四千八百多亿元。
