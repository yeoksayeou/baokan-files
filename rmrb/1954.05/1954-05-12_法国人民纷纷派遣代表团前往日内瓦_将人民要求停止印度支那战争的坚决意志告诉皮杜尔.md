    Xinhua News Agency, Eleventh Dispatch: TASS, Paris, Tenth Dispatch: "L'Humanité" reported that many democratic organizations and delegations from some industrial enterprises are setting off for Geneva in order to convey to Georges Bidault the firm will of the French people to stop the Indochina War.
    The French representative in Geneva, on May 8, refused to receive the delegation of workers from the Port of Marseille, saying: "It is impossible to receive all the delegations; there are too many delegations."
    The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received many letters and telegrams. For example, the telegram from the Gennevilliers Municipal Council of the Seine Province, composed of Communist Party members, Socialist Party members, "Independents," and Gaullist Party members, said that the residents of Gennevilliers City demanded negotiations on concluding a ceasefire agreement in Indochina.
    Former prisoners of war in Vitry-sur-Seine in the Seine Province also demanded that the French delegation in Geneva conduct negotiations on "immediately stopping the Indochina War and prohibiting atomic weapons."

    法国人民纷纷派遣代表团前往日内瓦
    将人民要求停止印度支那战争的坚决意志告诉皮杜尔
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：“人道报”报道，许多民主组织和一些工业企业的代表团正动身前往日内瓦，以便将法国人民要求停止印度支那战争的坚决意志告诉乔治·皮杜尔。
    日内瓦的法国代表在五月八日拒绝接见马赛港工人代表团时说：“不可能接见所有的代表团；代表团太多了。”
    法国外交部接到许多信件和电报。例如，由共产党员、社会党员、“独立人士”和戴高乐派党员组成的塞纳省日尼维埃市政委员会的电报说，日尼维埃市的居民要求举行关于缔结印度支那停火协定的谈判。
    塞纳省塞纳河上的维特里的前战俘也要求在日内瓦的法国代表团进行“立即停止印度支那战争和禁止原子武器”的谈判。
