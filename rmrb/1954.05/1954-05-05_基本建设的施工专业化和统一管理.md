Basic construction is a specialized, technically complex, comprehensive, and special industrial production based on specialization, and its degree of specialization is very high. For example, the construction of large-scale rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants includes specialized projects such as civil construction, metal structures, industrial pipelines, industrial furnace construction, mechanical installation, electrical installation, and transportation. Each specialized project includes many different types of work.

In 1952, Angang completed its restoration work and entered a period of large-scale construction. In this year, on the basis of the original construction force, a large number of basic construction teams were assembled. According to the principle of specialization, the original comprehensive civil construction company and installation company were gradually reorganized into four major engineering companies: steelmaking, rolling steel, blast furnace, and mining, each responsible for the respective system's projects. In addition, five specialized companies were established for industrial pipelines, mechanical installation, electrical installation, metal structures, and industrial furnace construction, as well as a civil construction company specializing in general housing construction, establishing a series of specialized construction organizations, laying the foundation for specialized construction.

Each construction and installation company also established its own organization according to the principle of specialization. The engineering teams under the engineering company are either basic engineering teams, responsible for the basic engineering construction of each specialized engineering company; or specialized engineering teams, responsible for more specialized engineering construction, which is the so-called major specialization and minor specialization. For example, the basic engineering team of the mechanical installation company is the engineering team responsible for the installation of steelmaking machinery, rolling steel machinery, and chemical machinery. In addition, specialized engineering teams such as lubricating oil equipment installation, rolling bearing installation and adjustment, and crane installation have been gradually cultivated. Although the degree of specialization of other engineering companies is not as significant as these two companies, they also have some specialized engineering teams, and this type of specialized engineering team is still gradually developing.

The grassroots organization of construction and installation engineering companies, that is, the construction team (or group) under the leadership of the section chief, is also organized according to the principle of specialization. One type is a purely specialized team, such as steel bar, wood formwork, and concrete teams. The other type is a mixed construction team mainly composed of specialized types of work, and including a certain amount of auxiliary types of work, such as a foundation masonry team including bricklaying, stonemasonry, scaffolding, and other types of work.

Due to the widespread implementation of specialized construction, good results have been achieved in the past two years.

First of all, technical forces have been rapidly and greatly cultivated and grown, and the technical level has been improved. In the past, a skilled worker had to be proficient in all aspects of his craft, so it was not easy to be proficient in everything; and it took several years or even one or two decades of experience to gradually become proficient and skilled. Now, with a detailed division of labor, it is easy for a person to become proficient in a shorter period of time by focusing on one technology. For example, the cable termination group of the Electrical Installation Company has a total of fifteen workers. In the past, most of them had not done this work. At the beginning of the work, Soviet experts personally guided and demonstrated. After forty-five days of study, they completely learned the advanced Soviet operation methods and mastered this specialized technology. For example, wiring, which could not be done by workers below the first or second grade in the past. Now, the wiring professional group has 20 workers, and over the past two or three months, while working and learning, 16 of the seventh and eighth grade workers have been able to catch up with the first and second grade workers, and the wiring quality has been improved. Like the above-mentioned various specialized engineering teams, such as lubricating oil equipment installation, rolling bearing installation and adjustment, electrical adjustment, instrument installation, and main drive motor installation, etc., we have never done them at all in the past, and some have never even heard of the names. We did not dare to unpack the Soviet equipment by ourselves, but as a result of the specialized construction team concentrating its efforts to learn from Soviet experts and actual operations, it has now become a technical force that has mastered advanced technology and accumulated quite rich experience. If a specialized approach had not been adopted, but a comprehensive construction team form had been adopted, learning and doing everything, it would obviously be impossible to quickly master technology and accumulate experience.

Secondly, specialized construction ensures and improves the quality of the project. For example, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the main drive motor installation team installed the main drive engines and motors in seamless steel pipe plants and large-scale rolling steel plants, and the quality generally reached the most advanced Soviet standards, which experts considered to be excellent. Other professional teams have also received the same results.

Thirdly, specialized construction improves labor organization and increases labor efficiency. In the past, most of them adopted a handicraft-style, all-inclusive construction method. Regardless of the level of technical proficiency, a worker did both technical and non-technical labor, resulting in very low efficiency. After implementing specialization, the rational organization of labor, the adoption of scientific division of labor and labor collaboration, efficiency has generally been improved. For example, to connect cable heads, it used to take six workers to make a 3,300-volt intermediate joint and four workers to make a terminal joint. After specialization, it takes only three workers to connect a 10,000-volt intermediate joint and only two workers to connect a terminal joint, and labor efficiency has more than doubled. For example, a fitter used to take 22 workdays to make a high-voltage distribution box. After specialization, it takes only 11 workdays to make one, and labor efficiency has doubled. Generally speaking, the implementation of specialization, from the handicraft all-inclusive method to the professional division of labor and labor collaboration, coupled with improved tools, can increase labor efficiency by several times.

However, the implementation of specialization is not without difficulties and obstacles. First of all, some workers and technicians will encounter ideological resistance. They worry that "specialization cannot learn comprehensive technology," "failure to pass the skills test will not lead to wage increases" (the skills test requires testing various technologies, which is not suitable for the direction of specialized development), and "not in line with personal interests, no development prospects." Secondly, leaders at all levels also have ideological concerns. They think that specialization is good, but they are afraid of idling when there is less work and not being able to finish it when there is more work. For these many concerns, repeated ideological mobilization is needed to explain the benefits of specialization. In fact, specialization is beneficial to both national construction and personal interests. Specialization is about mastering one skill, but it does not reject learning a second technology. In order to avoid idling, learning a second technology is necessary. If there are unreasonable aspects of the skill assessment standards, they should be modified.

Some comrades also believe that although specialized construction is good, it is too difficult to manage construction. There are six or seven engineering companies working together on a construction site, and they often do not coordinate well and interfere with each other. It is better to organize a site-based comprehensive engineering company with various construction and installation engineering teams under it. In this way, the command is unified, the scheduling is flexible, and the division of labor can be appropriately specialized. In fact, a comprehensive engineering company can only cope with general projects with relatively simple technology and small scale, and it cannot cope with important projects with large scale, complex technology, and strict quality requirements. The problem of unified management of specialized construction must be resolved and can be completely resolved. This has not only been proven by Soviet experience for a long time, but also proven again by the results of our two years of implementation.

In the large-scale rolling steel plant and seamless steel pipe plant construction site, according to Soviet experience, we implemented the responsibility system of the general contracting (i.e., general package) company and the responsibility system of the construction site director to organize the overall construction of several engineering companies. The entire project of the large-scale rolling steel plant and the seamless steel pipe plant is contracted by the steelmaking construction engineering company and the rolling steel engineering company, respectively. In addition to the general contracting company directly managing civil construction projects, other specialized projects are undertaken by five specialized engineering companies: metal structures, industrial pipelines, industrial furnace construction, mechanical installation, and electrical installation, serving as subcontractors. The general contracting company is responsible for organizing the overall construction of various specialized companies. The general contracting company organizes the construction site and assigns a construction site director to be responsible for organizing the overall construction. The construction site director is the organizer and commander of the overall construction of all projects on the entire construction site, and all specialized engineering companies are subject to the unified management of the construction site director. According to the specific situation of Angang, that is, the characteristic of Anshan Iron and Steel Company directly leading various construction and installation engineering companies, the basic responsibilities of the general package and its construction site director are stipulated as follows: First, the construction site director, according to the construction plan approved by the higher authorities, specifically organizes the general package and subcontracting construction units to compile a comprehensive operation plan, including the overall construction operation plan, the monthly operation plan, and the weekly daily operation plan, which is implemented after being approved by Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Second, in order to ensure the implementation of the comprehensive operation plan, the construction site director is responsible for specifically stipulating the method of construction coordination, specifically solving the problem of mutual coordination in construction, ensuring that the general package and subcontractors create construction conditions for each other, rather than interfering with each other. Strictly require each construction unit to abide by the construction procedures stipulated in the comprehensive operation plan, and correct the phenomenon of each going its own way and violating the construction procedures. Third, the construction site director is responsible for convening and presiding over the construction site operation meeting, and checking and supervising the implementation of the comprehensive operation plan week by week and day by day. However, outside the above-mentioned scope of responsibilities, the general package does not interfere with the subcontractors, and the general package construction site director does not interfere with the subcontractor engineering team leaders, and cannot interfere with the subcontractor's organizational management and business activities.

Experience has proven that this form and system of unified management can unify the specialized construction.

The unified management of the general package over the subcontractors is limited to the construction site director level. As for the grassroots organization of the general package—the section chief or foreman—the grassroots organization of the subcontractor—the section chief or foreman—cannot implement unified management at each level. The relationship between them is only a relationship of construction coordination. Based on the unified management of the construction site director and the comprehensive operation plan, construction is carried out under the independent leadership of each construction unit. Some people believe that the general package section chief or foreman should also implement unified management over the same-level subcontractor section chief or foreman, but facts have proven that it is unnecessary and impossible. As for the general package section carrying out a single project construction, which requires the subcontractor construction team to cooperate in the construction; or the subcontractor section carrying out a single project construction, which requires the general package or other subcontractor construction teams to cooperate in the construction; it should be stipulated that regardless of whether it is a general package or subcontractor unit, all teams that cooperate in the construction should unconditionally obey the unified command of the competent section foreman, obey the foreman's management during the cooperative construction period, and be responsible for the project quality to the end.

In order to implement the construction site director responsibility system, in addition to clearly stipulating the scope of responsibilities, it is also necessary to establish a certain system. That is, under the chairmanship of the construction site director and with the participation of the leaders of each subcontractor, establish a construction site operation meeting system. We stipulate a weekly operation meeting to check the implementation of the weekly operation plan and pass the operation plan for the next week; a daily operation meeting (usually one hour before the end of work) to check the implementation of the daily operation plan and stipulate the operation plan for the next day. At the meeting, the construction site director will solve the construction coordination problems between the general package and the subcontractors, and the decisions made should be implemented immediately by each subcontractor.

In addition to implementing it organizationally and systematically, the overall thinking and mutual support education should be carried out among all cadres and workers of the general package and the subcontractors. The general package and the construction site director should establish the idea of taking care of the overall situation and being fully responsible. The general package and the construction site director are prone to have the one-sided view of taking more care of themselves and less care of the subcontractors (such as the general package scheduling is loose, and the subcontractor scheduling is tight, etc.), or think that they cannot manage the subcontractors and relax management. These erroneous ideas need to be criticized. The subcontractors should be educated to obey the overall situation and respect unified management, and oppose local concepts and decentralism. The subcontractors must obey the unified management of the construction site director, obey the comprehensive operation plan, and must not emphasize the vertical system, using the excuse that the general package cannot solve the problem to refuse to implement the decisions of the construction site director.

Finally, the higher-level leading organs should strongly support the responsibilities of the general package and the construction site director. All the work within the scope of the responsibilities of the general package and the construction site director should be handled by them freely, and should not be directly interfered with. This is also a necessary condition for giving full play to the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the construction site director, helping to establish work prestige, and implementing the construction site director responsibility system.

    基本建设的施工专业化和统一管理
    鞍山钢铁公司副经理　赵北克
    基本建设施工是以专业化为基础的、技术复杂的、综合性的、特殊的工业生产，其专业化的程度是很高的。如建设大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，就包括土木建筑、金属结构、工业管道、工业筑炉、机械安装、电气安装、运输等项专业工程，每项专业工程又都包括许多不同的工种工程。
    鞍钢在一九五二年完成恢复工作，进入大规模建设时期。这一年，在原有建设力量的基础上，大量地集结基本建设队伍，根据专业化的原则，把原来的综合性的土木建筑公司和安装公司逐步改组划分为炼钢、轧钢、高炉、矿山等四个主要的工程公司，分别负责各该系统的工程。又成立了工业管道、机械安装、电气安装、金属结构、工业筑炉等五个专业公司及一个专门担负一般房屋建设的土木建筑公司，建立了一系列的专业化施工机构，为专业化施工打下了基础。
    各建筑安装公司也根据专业化的原则建立了自己的组织。工程公司所属的工程队，一种是基本工程队，担负着各专业工程公司的基本工程施工；一种是专业工程队，担负着更专门的工程施工，即所谓大专业与小专业。如机械安装公司的基本工程队是担负炼钢机械、轧钢机械、化工机械安装的工程队，另外又逐渐培养出润滑油设备安装、滚动轴承安装调整、起重机安装等专业工程队。电气安装公司除电气设备安装的基本工程队外，又逐渐培养出电气调整、自动热控制计器安装、主传动电机安装、电缆管道安装、电缆接头等专业工程队。其他工程公司专业化的程度虽不像这两个公司这样显著，但也拥有一些专业的工程队，而且这种专业化的工程队还在逐渐发展中。
    建筑安装工程公司的基层组织，即工段工长领导下的施工小队（或小组），也是按照专业化的原则组织的。一种是纯粹的专业小队，如钢筋、木模、混凝土小队等。一种是以专业工种为主，并包括一定量的辅助工种的混合施工小队，如砌筑地基小队包括砌砖、砌石、架工等工种。
    由于广泛地实施了专业化施工，两年来收到了良好的效果。
    首先是迅速地大量地培养与生长了技术力量，提高了技术水平。过去一个技术工人要对本门工艺技术样样都通，因而就不易样样都精；而且要积累几年甚至一二十年的经验，才能逐渐精通熟练。现在分工细致，一个人只钻研一种技术，就容易在较短的时期内做到精通。例如，电气安装公司接电缆头小组共十五个工人，过去大多数没有做过这一工作，开始工作时都是苏联专家亲自指导示范。经过四十五天的学习，他们完全学会了苏联的先进操作方法，掌握了这一专门技术。再如配线，过去不是一、二级工人是做不了的。现在配线专业小组共有工人二十名，两三个月来一边工作一边学习，其中十六个七、八级工都能赶上一、二级工人了，配线质量并有所提高。像上述各种专业工程队，如润滑油设备安装、滚动轴承安装调整、电气调整、计器安装、主传动电机安装等等，都是过去我们根本没做过的，有的甚至连名词都没听说过，苏联设备来了不敢自行拆箱，但是经过专业施工队集中力量向苏联专家学习与实际操作的结果，现在已成为掌握了先进技术，积累了相当丰富经验的技术力量了。如果不是采取专业化的方针，而是采取综合性的施工队形式，什么都学，什么都做，显然是无法迅速掌握技术与积累经验的。
    其次，专业化施工保证和提高了工程质量。例如在苏联专家指导下，主传动电机安装队在无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂安装的主传动发动机和电动机，质量普遍达到苏联最先进的标准，专家认为十分优良。其他各专业队也都收到了同样的效果。
    第三、专业化施工改善了劳动组织，提高了劳动效率。过去大都是采取手工业式的一揽子的施工方式，不分技术熟练程度，一个工人兼做技术劳作与非技术劳作，效率很低。实行专业化后，合理组织劳动力，采取科学分工与劳动协作，效率普遍提高。如接电缆头，过去作三千三伏特的中间接头，需用六个工，终端接头需要四个工。专业化后，接一万伏特的中间接头只用三个工，终端接头只用两个工，劳动效率提高一倍以上。再如钳工做一台高压配电箱原来要二十二个工日，专业化后，十一个工日即可做一台，劳动效率提高一倍。一般的说，实行专业化，从手工业一揽子方式改为专业分工的劳动协作，再加上改进工具，都能提高劳动效率一倍至数倍。
    但是，实行专业化并不是没有困难与阻碍的。首先，在一部分工人和技术人员中会遇到思想抵抗。他们顾虑“专业化学不到全面技术”，“考工不合格不能涨工资”（考工时要考各种技术，不适合专业化发展方向），“不合个人兴趣，没有发展前途”。其次，各级领导干部也有思想顾虑。他们认为专业化是好，就是怕活少了窝工，活多了干不完。对这许多顾虑，需要进行反复的思想动员，说明专业化的好处。事实上，专业化对国家建设和个人利益都是有好处的。专业化是精一门，但并不拒绝学习第二种技术。为了避免窝工，学习第二种技术是需要的。考工标准有不合理的地方要加以修改。
    还有一些同志，他们认为专业化施工虽好，但管理施工太困难。一个工地有六七个工程公司在一起施工，常常配合不好，相互牵扯，不如以工地为单位组织工地型的综合性工程公司，下设各种建筑安装工程队。这样指挥统一，调度灵活，又可适当分工专业。实际上，综合性的工程公司仅能应付技术比较简单，规模比较小的一般性工程，对规模庞大，技术复杂，质量严格的重要工程是完全不能应付的。而专业化施工的统一管理问题，则是必须解决和完全可以解决的。这不仅早已为苏联的经验所证明，而且我们两年来实行的结果也再一次作了证明。
    我们在大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂工地，根据苏联的经验，实行了总包（即大包）公司的负责制与工地主任责任制组织了几个工程公司的总体施工。大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的全部工程，即由炼钢建筑工程公司和轧钢工程公司两个总包公司分别负责承包。除总包公司直接经营土木建筑工程外，其他专业工程分别由金属结构、工业管道、工业筑炉、机械安装、电气安装五个专业工程公司承建，担任二包。总包公司负责组织各专业公司进行总体施工，由总包公司组织工地，指派工地主任担负组织总体施工的责任。工地主任就是整个工地全部工程总体施工的组织者与指挥者，各专业工程公司均服从工地主任的统一管理。我们根据鞍钢的具体情况，即鞍山钢铁公司直接领导各建筑安装工程公司的特点，规定大包及其工地主任的基本职责如下：第一、工地主任根据上级批准的建设计划，具体组织大包和二包各施工单位，汇总编制综合的作业计划，包括施工总作业计划、月作业计划及每周分日作业计划，经鞍钢公司批准执行。第二、为了保证综合作业计划的执行，工地主任负责具体规定施工的配合方法，具体解决施工中相互配合的问题，保证大包二包间相互创造施工条件，而不是相互牵制。严格要求各施工单位遵守综合作业计划规定的施工程序，纠正各自为政、违反施工程序的现象。第三、工地主任负责召集与主持工地作业会议，逐周逐日检查与监督综合作业计划的执行。但在上述职权范围以外的工作，大包对二包，大包工地主任对二包工程队长，则不加过问，并不能干涉二包组织管理与经营活动。
    经验证明：这种统一管理的形式和制度，是可以把专业化施工统一管理起来的。
    大包对二包实行统一管理，只限于工地主任一级。至于大包的基层组织——工段主任或工长，对二包的基层组织——工段主任或工长，则不能逐级分别实行统一管理。他们之间的关系，只是施工配合的关系。在工地主任统一管理与综合作业计划的基础上，在各个施工单位自行领导下，进行施工。有人认为大包工段主任或工长也要对同级的二包工段主任或工长实行统一管理，事实证明是不需要也是不可能的。至于大包工段进行一个单项工程施工，需要二包施工小组配合施工；或是二包工段进行单项工程施工，需要大包或其他二包施工小组配合施工；则应该规定，不论是大包或二包单位，凡是配合施工的小组，均应该无条件地服从主管工段工长的统一指挥，在配合施工期间，服从工长管理，并对工程质量负责到底。
    为了贯彻工地主任责任制，除了明确规定职责范围外，还必须建立一定的制度。即在工地主任主持、各二包工程队长参加下，建立工地作业会议制度。我们规定每周一次作业会议，检查本周作业计划执行情况，通过下周的作业计划；每日一次作业会议（时间一般在下班前一个钟头），检查当日作业计划执行情况，规定第二天的作业计划。并在会上由工地主任解决大包、二包之间的施工配合问题，所作的决定各二包应即执行。
    除了从组织上制度上贯彻外，在大包二包全体干部和职工中应进行整体思想相互支援的教育。大包和工地主任应该树立照顾全局、全面负责的思想。大包和工地主任容易产生多照顾自己少照顾二包的片面观点（如排进度大包排的松，二包排的紧等），或认为管不了二包，就放松了管理。对这些错误思想需要进行批判。对二包应进行服从全局、尊重统一管理的教育，反对局部观念、分散主义。二包必须服从工地主任的统一管理，服从综合的作业计划，不得强调垂直系统，借口大包不能解决问题而不执行工地主任的决定。
    最后，上级领导机关要大力支持总包与工地主任的职责，凡是总包与工地主任职责范围内的工作，应放手由其处理，不要直接干涉。这也是发挥工地主任责任心和积极性，帮助建立工作威信，贯彻工地主任责任制的必要条件。
