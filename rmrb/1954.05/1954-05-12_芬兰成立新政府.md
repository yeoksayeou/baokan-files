Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, May 10th: The leader of the Swedish People's Party in Finland, Ralf Johan Törngren, has formed a new government. Prior to this, the leaders of the Agrarian League and the Social Democratic Party had failed in their attempts to form a cabinet.

The Swedish People's Party holds thirteen seats in the two hundred-seat parliament. The Agrarian League (with fifty-three seats) and the Social Democratic Party (with fifty-four seats), which had failed to form a government, have both joined the Törngren-led government, each taking six positions in the cabinet. The main opposition party now is the Finnish People's Democratic League, composed of the Finnish Communist Party and the Social Unity Party, which holds forty-three seats in the parliament.
