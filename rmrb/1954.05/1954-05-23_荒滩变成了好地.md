　　Barren Beach Becomes Good Land
　　By Our Reporter Lü Jianzhong
　　This year's spring plowing production campaign in Yuanfang Village, Kaifeng County, Henan Province, is being carried out more enthusiastically than in any previous year. The Zhao Qingbo Agricultural Production Cooperative has long set a patriotic production increase plan of "producing 500,000 jin of grain and economic crops in 1954 and selling 300,000 jin to the state," and has driven the cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the whole village to launch a competition. In order to effectively achieve deep plowing and fine cultivation, preserve moisture, prevent drought, and sow in a timely manner, in addition to reasonably organizing labor, carrying out side manure delivery, side manure spreading, following the plow, and following the harrow, the cooperative has also added more than a dozen large mules and twelve eight-inch walking plows to transform all the barren beaches of the cooperative into fertile soil. They had plowed and harrowed more than 480 mu of spring land in March, and expanded the planting area of oil crops - peanuts according to the state plan. In addition, more than 3,000 peach and apple trees were planted on the sandy land. In three to five years, the cooperative's income from orchards, willow trees, and other sideline productions alone will be 2 billion yuan per year. Now, whenever workers, farmers, and students from nearby Kaifeng come to Yuanfang Village to visit, the cooperative members are always enthusiastically introducing to them how they guarantee to complete the patriotic production increase plan and how they are organized to turn this barren beach into good land.

　　"The Yellow River has nine bends, and every bend has sandy beaches." Yuanfang Village is a large village on the Yellow River beach. Before liberation, on the dozens of miles of sandy land here, whether wheat or peanuts were planted, a gust of wind would lift the roots, scorch the leaves, and even bury them under the sand. Spring crops often had to be replanted three or four times - one year they were replanted eight times. Autumn crops were also often flooded. As a result, the farmers in Yuanfang Village often lived a hard life of fleeing famine, begging for food, and being tenant farmers.

　　After the land reform, the farmers were given land and organized to plant trees and prevent floods, and their lives gradually improved. However, the soil here is very mixed, with more than a dozen types such as barren beach land, drifting sand land, fire sand land, green sand land, and Mengjin land. Some are afraid of drought, and some are afraid of floods. Some places are suitable for planting wheat, while others are suitable for planting peanuts. This requires transforming the natural conditions of the sandy beach - mainly by deep plowing, turning up the fertile black silt soil six or seven inches deep under the sandy soil, and ensuring that the soil is suitable for planting what, in order to fundamentally change the face of this yellow sandy beach and enable everyone to live a more prosperous life.

　　The Zhao Qingbo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuanfang Village solved this problem for the first time.

　　This cooperative was developed from a mutual aid group in the spring of 1952. At that time, the leader of the mutual aid group - Communist Party member Zhao Qingbo, under the education of the Party and in practice, experienced that although the output of the mutual aid group was more than 10% higher than that of the individual farmers in the village, if the method of agricultural production cooperative, land shares, unified management, and expanding public property, using new farm tools, and improving the soil was not adopted, production could not be improved further. Therefore, he educated the group members to recognize the superiority of the cooperative and the bright future of socialism, and upgraded the mutual aid group to an agricultural production cooperative.

　　After the establishment of the cooperative, with the support of the People's Government, more than a dozen seven-inch walking plows and one ten-inch walking plow were bought for deep plowing. The sandy soil was pressed down, and the black oily silt soil was turned up. More fertilizer was applied, and the soil quality became more and more fertile. In addition, the cooperative's land was managed in a unified way, and what crops were suitable for planting on that piece of land were planted, greatly leveraging the potential of the land. During planting, reasonable close planting was also implemented, and the land was managed by the members in assigned plots. The agricultural production cooperative also mobilized the masses in the whole village and surrounding villages to plant a shelterbelt along the Yellow River, so that the crops were protected from wind damage, and the land yield was greatly increased. In the first year of the establishment of the cooperative, the average yield per mu reached 245 jin, an increase of 50% compared with the mutual aid group in 1951. In 1953, the average yield per mu was further increased to 341 jin, exceeding the mutual aid group and individual households in the village by 50% to more than 100%. In particular, the cooperative, based on the principle of close planting of wheat, researched a method of close planting of peanuts, and the high-yield peanuts per mu increased from the general yield of 250 jin to the local record of more than 1,100 jin. Therefore, after last autumn, each member received an average of more than 1,000 jin of grain.

　　However, many farmers in Yuanfang Village in the past did not see this path, thinking that they could also transform nature and improve their lives single-handedly. Wang Benzheng was such a typical example. He planted land for landlords for more than 20 years, breaking his back and shedding tears, but he didn't even have a cup of noodles for the holidays. Now that he has been liberated, he took more than 1,000 jin of surplus grain to lend out, and later used the money from lending to buy eight mu of sandy land. He relied on himself as one of the best farmers in the village, and felt that he would suffer even if he joined the mutual aid group. So he spent 110,000 yuan to buy an old-fashioned plow from Zhang Gongxun, a member of the Zhao Qingbo Agricultural Production Cooperative, and then, according to his wife's plan, raised an old sow, and then withdrew from the mutual aid group to work alone.

　　Wang Benzheng got up early and worked late every day, and indeed did his best. However, an old plow, no matter how deep it is, can only plow three or four inches. Plowing back and forth can only float on the surface of the sandy soil. Sometimes he also secretly observed the land plowed by the cooperative, and the silt soil turned up was black and oily, while his land was still loose yellow sand. In addition, he only had a few mu of land, and no matter what the soil quality, he had to plant a little of everything. Therefore, no crop could compare with the cooperative. Last year, his wheat harvest was 30% less than that of the cooperative; the high-yield peanuts densely planted by the cooperative yielded more than 1,100 jin per mu, while he only yielded 300 jin per mu. Although he also knew the benefits of the new-style walking plow, he couldn't afford it!

　　Since starting to study the general line in November last year, the socialist consciousness of the masses in Yuanfang Village has been greatly improved; at the same time, with the Zhao Qingbo Agricultural Production Cooperative as a living example, everyone clearly realized that only by establishing agricultural production cooperatives and using new-style farm tools can they have the conditions to change the old face of the yellow sandy beach and realize the happy life of socialism as soon as possible. Therefore, "taking the socialist road" has become a hot trend. The Zhao Qingbo Agricultural Production Cooperative has expanded from 18 households to 83 households, and with the four newly established agricultural production cooperatives, it accounts for half of the total number of households in the village. The other farmers have also all participated in the mutual aid groups, and are actively creating conditions to prepare for transferring to the cooperative and adding new-style farm tools. At this time, Wang Benzheng was educated by the facts and regretted that he had taken the wrong path, so he sold his surplus grain to the state and also joined the Zhao Qingbo Agricultural Production Cooperative, and was elected as the production team leader of the second production team.

　　The members are now full of confidence and say: In another three to five years, Yuanfang Village will become a collective farm when the cooperatives and mutual aid groups are merged, and will be able to use tractors.

    荒滩变成了好地
    本报记者  吕建中
    河南开封县袁房村今年的春耕生产运动开展得比以往任何一年都热烈。赵清波农业生产合作社老早就订出了“一九五四年生产粮食和经济作物五十万斤，卖给国家三十万斤”的爱国增产计划，并带动全村的合作社和互助组展开了竞赛，为了切实做到深耕细作，保墒防旱和及时播种，社里除了合理地组织劳力，进行边送粪、边撒粪、随犁、随耙外，又增添了十几头大骡子和十二张八吋步犁，要把全社的荒滩统统改变成肥沃的土壤。他们三月份就把四百八十多亩春地犁耙完毕，并按照国家计划扩大了油料作物——花生的播种面积。另外还在沙地上栽了三千多棵桃树和苹果。三、五年以后，社里光果园和柳棵以及其它副业生产，每年就能收入二十亿元。现在，每逢开封附近的工人、农民和学生来袁房村参观的时候，社员们总是兴致勃勃地向他们介绍自己怎样保证完成爱国增产计划，怎样组织起来把这片荒滩变成好地。
    “万里黄河九道弯，弯弯都有黄沙滩。”袁房村就是黄河滩上的一个大村庄。解放前，这里几十里的沙地上，无论种上小麦或是花生，一阵大风就掀了根，焦了叶，甚至埋到沙底下。春季作物往往要重播三、四次——有一年竟重播了八次。秋庄稼也常常遭受水淹。因此使袁房村的农民经常过着逃荒，要饭，当佃户的苦难日子。
    土地改革后，农民分了土地，又组织起来造林，防汛，生活逐渐好了。但是，这里土质很杂，有荒滩地、飞沙地、火沙地、青沙地、蒙金地等十几种，有的怕旱，有的怕涝，这里适合种小麦，那里又适合种花生，这就必须改造沙滩的自然条件——主要是用深犁的办法，把六、七寸深沙土下面那肥沃的黑淤土翻上来，并做到土质适合种什么就种什么，才能从根本上改变这片黄沙滩的面貌，使大家过着更富裕的生活。
    袁房村的赵清波农业生产合作社就破天荒第一次地解决了这个问题。
    这个合作社是一九五二年春天由互助组发展起来的，当时的互助组长——共产党员赵清波在党的教育下、在实际中，体验到互助组的产量虽比村里的单干农民高一成多，但如果不采用农业生产合作社的办法，土地入股，统一经营，并扩大公共财产，使用新农具，改良土壤，就不能把生产再提高一步。于是他就教育组员们认识合作社的优越性和社会主义的光明远景，把互助组提高成农业生产合作社了。
    合作社成立后，在人民政府的扶持下，买来十几张七吋步犁和一张十吋步犁进行深耕，沙土压下去，黑油油的淤土翻上来，肥料施得多，土质越来越肥壮；加上社里的土地统一经营，那片地适合种什么就种什么，大大地发挥了土地的潜力。在种植时又实行了合理密植，土地由社员分片负责管理。农业生产合作社又发动全村和联合周围村的群众在黄河边栽培起一道防护林，使庄稼免受风害，土地产量大为提高，建社头一年平均每亩产量就达到二百四十五斤，比一九五一年互助组时增产五成。一九五三年每亩平均产量又提高到三百四十一斤。超过村里的互助组和单干户五成到一倍多。尤其社里根据小麦密植的道理研究出密植花生的办法，每亩丰产花生竟由一般产量二百五十斤提高到一千一百多斤的当地最高纪录。因此去年秋后每个社员平均都分到一千多斤粮食。
    然而袁房村不少农民过去却没有看到这条道路，以为单枪匹马也能够改造自然，改善生活。王本正就是这样一个典型，他给地主种了二十多年地，累断了腰筋，流干了眼泪，可是逢年过节要一酒盅面也没有，如今翻身了，他却把一千多斤余粮拿去放账，后来又用放账的钱买了八亩沙土地。他倚仗着自己是村里数一数二的好庄稼手，觉得连参加互助组自己也吃亏，于是便花了十一万元买了赵清波农业生产合作社社员张功勋的一张旧式犁，又按照老婆的打算养一只老母猪，然后就退出互助组单干了。
    王本正天天起早搭晚，的确尽了自己最大的努力。然而一张旧犁再深也不过犁三、四寸，犁来犁去只能在沙土层上面打飘飘，有时他也暗中察看了合作社犁的地，那翻上来的淤土黑油油的，而自己的土地上却仍然是松散的黄沙。加上他只那几亩地，不管什么土质，样样庄稼都得种点。因此没有一样庄稼能比得上合作社，去年小麦比合作社少收三成；合作社实行密植的丰产花生每亩收一千一百多斤，他每亩却只收三百斤。虽然他也知道了新式步犁的好处，但又买不起！
    去年十一月间开始学习总路线，袁房村群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高了；同时有了赵清波农业生产合作社这个活的榜样，大家清楚地认识到只有成立农业生产合作社，使用新式农具，才有条件改变黄沙滩的旧面貌，早日实现社会主义的幸福生活。因此“走社会主义的路”便形成了热潮。赵清波农业生产合作社由十八户扩大到八十三户，加上新成立的四个农业生产合作社就占了全村总户数的一半。其它的农户也全参加了互助组，而且都在积极创造条件准备转社，添制新式农具。这时，王本正在事实面前受到了教育，后悔自己走错了路，便把余粮卖给国家，也加入了赵清波农业生产合作社。并且被选为第二生产队的生产小组长。
    社员们现在都满怀信心地说：袁房村再过三、五年，合作社和互助组一挂、一并，就成了集体农庄，就能用上拖拉机了。
