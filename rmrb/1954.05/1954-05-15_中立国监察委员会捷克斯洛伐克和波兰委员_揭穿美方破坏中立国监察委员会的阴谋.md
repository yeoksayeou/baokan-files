Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 13th: The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) wrote to the U.S. Senior Member of the Military Armistice Commission on May 8th, refuting the libelous and intimidating letter sent by the U.S. Senior Member Rassi to the NNSC on April 15th. The Korean-Chinese side received a copy of the Czechoslovak and Polish members' letter on May 9th.

On April 15th, the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC submitted a "Report on the Obstruction and Restriction of the Activities of Neutral Nations Inspection Teams by the United Nations Command side" to the Military Armistice Commission. On the same day, Rassi sent a libelous and intimidating letter to the NNSC, attempting to cover up the U.S. side's violations of the Armistice Agreement and evade responsibility. In the letter, Rassi wantonly slandered the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC and viciously attacked, saying: "The NNSC has been paralyzed to the point where it cannot fulfill its obligations as stated in the provisions of the Armistice Agreement," asserting that it "will never be able to fulfill all of its obligations in the future."

The Czechoslovak and Polish members pointed out that Rassi's libelous and intimidating letter was an attempt to sabotage the NNSC, so that the U.S. side could freely bring military reinforcements into Korea, thereby more seriously undermining the stability of the armistice and making a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue impossible. The Czechoslovak and Polish members expressed their intention to continue performing their duties and exposing U.S. violations of the Armistice Agreement.

The full text of the letter from Lieutenant General Blahí, the Czechoslovak member of the NNSC, and Major General Krzeminski, the Polish member of the NNSC, is as follows:

"The NNSC has received and considered Major General Rassi's letter of April 15, 1954, which contains libel and intimidation against this Commission. The accusations you have made against certain members of this Commission regarding your requests for special investigations by Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to areas controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as to areas of the United Nations Command, are completely unfounded. The NNSC has always satisfied requests for special investigations if they comply with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, strictly adhering to the letter and spirit of the Armistice Agreement. Consequently, the NNSC, at your request, dispatched a mobile inspection team to the Uiju airport in the area controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The special investigation conducted by the inspection team in Uiju proved that your accusations against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were unfounded. Your remaining requests not only contradicted the provisions of the Armistice Agreement but were also attempts to turn the NNSC into a tool for achieving your political and propaganda aims. For example, on November 29, 1953, you requested the NNSC to conduct a special investigation and interrogate three individuals who were allegedly escaped prisoners of war from North Korea. You first requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to conduct the investigation. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission rejected this request. The NNSC also has no authority to conduct this investigation. Your request for an investigation into the alleged detention of your prisoners of war by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers reached the NNSC after you had disrupted the explanatory work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, prepared to forcibly detain prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and finally detained tens of thousands of people. Obviously, you were then attempting to offset, to some extent, your own serious violations of the Armistice Agreement concerning the issue of prisoners of war by accusing the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and you were attempting to use the NNSC to achieve this purpose. When you did not succeed, your Senior Member of the Military Armistice Commission wrote a letter to the NNSC on February 19, in which he threatened the existence of this Commission.

Major General Rassi's letter of April 15, 1954, also contains strong intimidation against the NNSC. It attempts to conceal the United Nations Command's violations of the Armistice Agreement in order to evade responsibility and consequences. It is no coincidence that Major General Rassi sent that letter precisely when the report of the Polish and Czechoslovak members was sent to the Military Armistice Commission. That report contains many facts about your violation of the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, restricting and obstructing the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at various ports under your control, preventing them from conducting effective supervision and inspection. Despite these restrictions and obstructions, the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams have exposed many serious violations of the Armistice Agreement by your side in bringing combat materials into Korea.

The NNSC has become inconvenient for you because it prevents the free entry of combat materials into Korea as reinforcements. That is why you not only do not cease the restrictions and obstructions imposed on the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at the various ports under your control, and do not create the conditions for effective supervision and inspection as guaranteed by the Armistice Agreement, but instead continue to restrict and obstruct, and strengthen these restrictions and obstructions, thereby effectively paralyzing the activities of the inspection teams at these ports. Under these circumstances, the NNSC can only perform its duties in the areas controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are providing the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams with all possible assistance and cooperation.

The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC reject Major General Rassi's libelous and intimidating letter because they must consider it an attempt to sabotage this Commission, so that your side can freely bring military reinforcements into Korea, thereby undermining the stability of the armistice and making a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue impossible. The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the NNSC are determined to continue performing their duties, even with your restrictions, and even in the future, regardless of your attitude towards the Commission, it will still report every violation of the Armistice Agreement that threatens the stability of the Korean armistice."

    中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员
    揭穿美方破坏中立国监察委员会的阴谋
    【新华社开城十三日电】中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员在五月八日写信给军事停战委员会美方首席委员，驳斥美方首席委员拉西四月十五日致中立国监察委员会的诽谤性和恐吓性的信件。朝中方面在五月九日收到了捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员信件的副本。
    四月十五日，中立国监察委员会波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员曾向军事停战委员会提出了“关于联合国军方面阻挠与限制中立国视察小组活动的报告”，拉西就在同一天发出致中立国监察委员会的诽谤性和恐吓性的信，企图掩盖美方违反停战协定的行为，以逃避责任。拉西在信中大肆诬蔑中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员，并恶毒地攻击说：“中立国监察委员会已瘫痪到不能执行停战协定条款中陈述的它所承担的义务的那种程度”，断言它“今后也决不能履行其所承担的全部义务”。
    捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员指出，拉西的诽谤性和恐吓性的信是企图破坏中立国监察委员会，以便美方能以军事增援自由地运入朝鲜，从而更严重地破坏停战的稳定，并使朝鲜问题的和平解决成为不可能。捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员表示将继续执行职责，揭露美方违反停战协定的事件。
    中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员布莱希中将和波兰委员克谢敏少将的信全文如下：
    “中立国监察委员会收到并考虑了拉西少将一九五四年四月十五日包含着对本委员会的诽谤和威吓的来信。在你方要求由中立国视察小组到朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面控制地区以及联合国军方面地区去进行特别调查这件事上，你方对本委员会某些委员所提出的指控是完全没有根据的。对于进行特别调查的要求，假如它们符合停战协定的规定，严格遵守停战协定的文字和精神，中立国监察委员会总是予以满足的。因之，中立国监察委员会曾经根据你方要求，派出一个机动视察小组到朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面控制地区内的义州机场去。视察小组在义州所进行的特别调查证明，你方对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面的指控是没有根据的。你方其余的要求非但和停战协定的规定相抵触，而且还是把中立国监察委员会变成你方达到政治和宣传目的的工具的企图。例如，在一九五三年十一月二十九日，你方要求中立国监察委员会进行特别调查，讯问三个人，这三个人据称是从北朝鲜逃跑的你方战俘。你方首先要求中立国遣返委员会进行调查。中立国遣返委员会拒绝了这一要求。中立国监察委员会也是无权进行这一调查的。你方对调查所指控的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面扣留你方战俘事件的要求到达中立国监察委员会时，是在你方破坏了中立国遣返委员会的解释工作、准备强迫扣留朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的战俘和最后扣留了好几万人的前后。显然，你方当时是企图以指控朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的办法来在某种程度上抵消自己严重违反有关战俘问题的停战协定，并试图利用中立国监察委员会来达到这一目的。当你方没有成功的时候，军事停战委员会你方的首席委员就在二月十九日给中立国监察委员会写了一封信，在信里他威胁了本委员会的存在。
    拉西少将一九五四年四月十五日的信中也包含着对中立国监察委员会的强烈的威吓。它企图隐瞒联合国军方面违反停战协定的行为，以逃避责任和后果。拉西少将送来那封信恰巧是在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的报告被送到军事停战委员会的时候，这并不是偶然的。该报告载有你方违反了停战协定的规定，限制与阻挠你方控制下地区内的各口岸中立国视察小组，使它们不能进行有效的监督与视察的许多事实。尽管有这些限制与阻挠，中立国视察小组还是揭露了你方以作战物资运入朝鲜的许多严重违反停战协定的事件。
    中立国监察委员会对你们说来已成为不方便的，因为它阻止以增援作战物资自由运入朝鲜。这就是为什么你方不但不终止强加于其控制下各口岸中立国视察小组上的限制与阻挠，不创造如停战协定所保证的进行有效监督与视察的条件，反而在继续限制与阻挠，并加强这些限制与阻挠，从而实际上使在这些口岸的各视察小组的活动陷于瘫痪。在这种情况之下，中立国监察委员会仅能在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面控制下的地区内执行其职责。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面是给予中立国视察小组以一切可能的协助与合作的。
    中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员拒绝拉西少将的诽谤性与恐吓性的来信，因为他们不得不认为该信是企图破坏本委员会，以便你方能以军事增援自由地运入朝鲜，从而破坏停战稳定，并使朝鲜问题的和平解决成为不可能。中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员决心继续执行其职责，就是受到你方的限制也将如此，甚至在将来，不管你方对委员会所采取的态度如何，它还是要报告威胁朝鲜停战稳定的每一桩违反停战协定事件。”
