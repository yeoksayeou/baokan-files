Our country's experiment with towing log rafts at sea has been successful. It saves a large amount of shipping and railway transport capacity.

Our country has successfully tested the method of using tugboats to tow log rafts at sea. The first tugboat used in the trial tow was the Min 330. This tugboat towed a batch of log rafts from Dalian and arrived in Shanghai in April. This has opened up a new avenue for our country's future maritime transport of timber.

In the past, when our country transported timber by sea, the timber was loaded onto ships like other goods. A very large ship would be full after only carrying a small amount of timber, which wasted a lot of shipping space. Last year, Soviet expert Bashevich suggested to the General Bureau of Maritime Transport of the Ministry of Transportation that timber be bundled into rafts with steel cables and floated on the water, towed by tugboats in front. In this way, a large amount of timber could be towed to various coastal ports. The General Bureau of Maritime Transport accepted this suggestion and began preparations in December last year. Under the leadership of the Dalian Port Authority, representatives from the Ministry of Forestry, Dalian Maritime College, Shanghai Maritime Bureau, and other units formed a trial log raft committee. In early April this year, based on advanced Soviet experience, they assembled the first "cigar" shaped log raft in the history of China's maritime transport, and in mid-April, it was safely towed to Shanghai by the Min 330 tugboat of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau.

After towing log rafts at sea, a large amount of shipping and railway transport capacity can be saved. Many ships and trains can be used to transport other goods, instead of being occupied by timber. The cost of towing log rafts at sea will also be greatly reduced compared to the past. In the past, the shipping cost of one cubic meter of timber from Dalian in Northeast China to Shanghai was more than 140,000 yuan. Using the raft towing method, the cost is only 88,000 yuan per cubic meter. If 600,000 cubic meters are transported from Dalian to Shanghai each year, the country can save more than 30 billion yuan. If compared with railway transport, the savings in freight are even greater. Transporting 600,000 cubic meters of timber from Yichun to Dalian by train, and then from Dalian to Shanghai by raft towing, will save more than 100 billion yuan compared to transporting the timber entirely by train from Yichun to Shanghai. Starting in July, the method of towing rafts will be gradually implemented in various coastal areas of our country to transport timber.

    我国海上拖运木排的办法试验成功
    节省了大量轮船和火车的运输力量
    我国在海上用拖轮拖运木排的办法已经试验成功。第一只试拖的拖轮是民三三零号，该拖轮由大连拖运一批木排，已于四月间到达上海。这给我国今后在海上运输木材开辟了新的道路。
    我国过去在海上运输木材，是把木材和其他货物一样，装在轮船里面运输，一艘很大的轮船，只装运重量不大的木材就满了，浪费很多船位。去年，苏联专家巴谢维奇建议中央交通部海运总局，把木材用钢绳扎成木排，浮在水上，由拖轮在前面拖运，这样，大量木材就可被拖运到沿海各个港口。海运总局接受了这一建议，于去年十二月开始准备，由大连区港务局主持，林业部、大连航海学院、上海海运局等派员参加组成试扎木排委员会，在今年四月初根据苏联先进经验，扎成了中国海运有史以来第一个“雪茄”形木排，并于四月中由上海海运局民三三零号拖轮安全拖达上海。
    在海上拖运木排以后，可以节省大量轮船和火车的运输力量，许多轮船和火车，都可以用来运别的货物，而不必被木材占用了。海上拖运木排的费用，也将比过去大大节省。过去从东北大连到上海，船运一立方公尺的木材要十四万多元的运费，而用拖排的办法运输，每立方公尺才八万八千元，每年从大连到上海，如以运六十万立方公尺算，就可给国家节省三百多亿元。如果和火车运输相比，那就节省的运费更大，用火车把六十万立方公尺木材从伊春运到大连，再从大连用拖排的办法运到上海，比从伊春完全用火车把木材运到上海，要节省一千多亿元。从七月份起，我国沿海各地将逐渐推行拖排的办法，运输木材。
