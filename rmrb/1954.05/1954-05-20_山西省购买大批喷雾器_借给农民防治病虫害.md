    Shanxi Province Purchases a Large Number of Sprayers
    To Lend to Farmers for Pest and Disease Control
    In order to help farmers with low purchasing power to prevent and control pests and diseases, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has invested in the purchase of 21,611 sprayers. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has strategically distributed them to farms in various counties throughout the province for responsible management, so that they are available for farmers to borrow. Lending procedures have now been stipulated, which will play a significant role in this year's prevention and control of pest and disease disasters. (Lu Sheng)
