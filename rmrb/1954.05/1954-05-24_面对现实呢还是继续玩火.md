　　Face Reality or Continue Playing with Fire
　　By our reporters Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
　　After the recess on May 20 and frequent individual contacts, the foreign ministers participating in the discussion on the restoration of peace in Indochina returned to the conference hall on the 21st.
　　According to information revealed by Western newspapers and news agencies, at this longest-lasting closed meeting, the foreign ministers have accepted Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal on the discussion procedure made at the first closed meeting. That is, Van Tien Dung’s proposal and Bidault’s proposal will be discussed together, first discussing the military armistice issue, and then discussing the political issues. There are reports that at the closed meeting on the 21st, the representatives of Western countries had to withdraw their persistent demands to impose their proposals on the conference over the past three days. The agreement reached at the meeting was to conduct a general and broad exchange of views on the military armistice part of the Van Tien Dung and Bidault proposals, agree on general principles, and then deal with specific situations based on actual circumstances. This indicates that the meeting is progressing. The unrealistic and unreasonable demands of the Western representatives have been thwarted, although it cannot be said that they have completely abandoned these demands.
　　The detailed situation of the closed meeting is unknown, but Smith's and Bidault's views on this issue are very clear. They have talked about them in the general debate on the Indochina issue. For example, on May 8, Mr. Bidault said in his speech, "The French government has completely and unreservedly recognized the independence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The war has become meaningless, and the French government has long expressed its willingness to obtain a reasonable solution to stop hostilities. This is the primary task of the Geneva Conference. As for political issues, the governments of the three federal member states are qualified to raise these issues, and they will express their opinions and seek solutions after the war ends."
　　What a hypocritical and cunning attitude! From the speeches of Bidault and Smith, people can see that their main argument is that the three Indochina countries are already completely "independent." Today's war in Laos and Cambodia is an "invasion by the Viet Minh," and in Vietnam, it is a "civil war." Therefore, "as long as the Viet Minh withdraws from Laos and Cambodia" and as long as the war in Vietnam stops, everything is "simple" and everything can be completed. That is to say, according to the opinions of the Western representatives, the conference should only talk about military affairs and not politics, first deal with the issues of Laos and Cambodia separately, and the "Viet Minh troops" in Laos and Cambodia should withdraw completely, and the resistance governments and armies of the two countries should be completely eliminated. In the words of the American "Christian Science Monitor" on May 17, "Western representatives are expected to take a common position against any plan that combines the Indochina ceasefire issue with a political solution, and insist that the direct task of the conference is to achieve a cessation of the conflict without any conditions."
　　In commenting on this "strategic plan" of only talking about ceasefire without talking about politics, many upright French newspapers said that it was a delaying tactic by the colonialists. As early as the fourth meeting on the Indochina issue on May 14, Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out that "the Geneva Conference cannot understand this task as turning the cessation of hostilities in Indochina into a cunningly arranged breathing opportunity for one party hoping to use it to prepare for the expansion of the Indochina war."
　　Originally, Foreign Minister Molotov supplemented Delegate Van Tien Dung's proposal with two suggestions: neutral country supervision of the ceasefire and joint guarantee of the implementation of the agreement by the relevant countries, which provided a good start for holding closed meetings to specifically negotiate solutions. Representatives had agreed to Molotov's suggestions regarding the conference procedure at the first closed meeting. However, at the second closed meeting, the representatives of Western countries created complications again, putting forward an unreasonable proposal to deal with the issues of Laos and Cambodia separately first, attempting to force the conference to accept it. Despite their quibbles in the meeting and their intimidation outside the meeting, their plan did not succeed, but delayed the progress of the conference and wasted valuable four days.
　　Judging from the situation of yesterday's meeting revealed by Western journalists, it seems that Western representatives realize that intimidation and fraud alone will not work, and they have had to withdraw their absurd proposal to deal with the issues of Laos and Cambodia separately first, and have to accept Foreign Minister Molotov's suggestion to continue talking. The progress of yesterday's closed meeting vividly illustrates that it is impossible to impose any unrealistic or unreasonable demands on the conference.
　　General public opinion believes that the question now is first of all whether the representatives of Western countries, especially the French representative, are willing to seriously face reality. What is the reality of Indochina today? The Geneva reporter of the Paris "Le Monde," which represents the views of a considerable part of the French bourgeoisie, said, "Mr. Bidault refuses to discuss political issues, but negotiations can only be conducted and agreements can only be reached when the real situation is taken into account. The reality, confirmed by neutral Asian countries and recognized by Britain, is that the Viet Minh is strong primarily because the struggle it is waging represents the will of the nation. Therefore, only when it has received formal assurances from the French side regarding the unification of Vietnam and the freedom of the Vietnamese people to choose their own regime can the Viet Minh lay down its arms and give up its favorable military situation." That is to say, the attitude of facing reality is that we must consider the Indochina people's irresistible will to strive for peace, national independence, and freedom, and that colonialism must stop.
　　Now, when assessing the progress of the Geneva Conference on the discussion of the Indochina issue, people cannot fail to notice the destructive activities of those who fear peace and conspire to expand the Indochina war, both inside and outside the meeting, from Geneva to Washington. Recent experience has proved that whenever the conference has made some progress, these forces are busy placing obstacles on the road ahead. Isn't that so? When an agreement was reached on the issue of evacuating the wounded from Dien Bien Phu, and the people of the world, especially the French people, were celebrating the hope for peace, this agreement was immediately torn up, and large-scale breach of contract bombing by the French colonial army began; when the conference proposed a neutral country supervision and international guarantee plan for the implementation of the Indochina ceasefire program due to Foreign Minister Molotov's efforts, the US authorities panicked again. They immediately used the unjust letters of the Swiss and Swedish members participating in the supervision of the Korean armistice to create an atmosphere that neutral country supervision would not work, in order to poison public opinion. It is conceivable that their conspiracies and sabotage activities will be further strengthened as the conference moves further forward.
　　According to newspaper reports, it was decided at yesterday's closed meeting that the next meeting would continue next Monday. It is expected that the discussion of specific issues will begin at that time. From the contents of the two proposals by Delegate Van Tien Dung and Bidault, as well as Molotov's supplementary proposals, it can be seen that the discussion on military armistice issues will include a comprehensive ceasefire, adjustment of the areas where the two sides' troops are stationed, cessation of the import of reinforcements and military equipment and materials from outside Indochina, and the issue of supervision by neutral country committees at the same time as the mixed committees composed of representatives of the warring parties supervise the implementation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement; the issue of guarantees provided by the participants in the Geneva Conference. The complexity of these issues is obvious. However, as long as the parties concerned have the sincerity to seek a solution, it is not difficult to reach an agreement.
　　However, existing signs indicate that certain powerful people in Western countries have still not abandoned their old ideas. They still disregard the national rights of the Indochina people, still refuse to face reality, still attempt to maintain colonial rule, still try to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching a fair and reasonable agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and are still accelerating preparations aimed at expanding the Indochina war. Just three days ago, news came from Washington that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is being actively organized, and the United States is determined to complete preparations by the end of June... The Paris "Liberation" said: "Now some people want to carry out diplomatic intimidation and threats, trying to get Ho Chi Minh to put forward better conditions." The London "Times" of May 19 also said: "The French side... believes that the intimidation of possible participation of American troops will affect the willingness of the Communists to negotiate in Geneva, but in Washington, people doubt whether Mr. Dulles' intimidation will be taken as seriously in the future as it has been in the past."
　　Of course, threats and intimidation can never shake the will of the Indochina people to strive for national independence. It has been proven in the past few weeks that using such means to manipulate the Geneva Conference has failed, and it cannot be expected to produce results favorable to those who play with fire in the future.
　　Reality is ruthless, but it must be faced. For some French officials who aim to expand the US intervention in the Indochina war and use conspiracies and tricks to delay and undermine the Geneva Conference, continuing to play with fire can only result in burning themselves.

### 面对现实呢还是继续玩火

    面对现实呢还是继续玩火
    本报记者　吴文焘　李庄
    经过五月二十日的休会和频繁的个别接触，参加讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的外长们二十一日又回到会议厅去了。
    根据西方报纸和通讯社所透露的情况看，在这历时最久的秘密会上，外长们已接受了莫洛托夫外长在第一次秘密会议上所提出的关于讨论程序的建议，这就是说将范文同的提案和皮杜尔的提案合并讨论，先讨论军事停战问题接着就讨论政治问题。有消息说在二十一日的秘密会议上西方国家的代表们已不得不收回他们三天来固执地企图强加于会议的主张。会议已达成的协议是就范文同和皮杜尔两个建议中有关军事停战部分进行一般的广泛的交换意见，协议一般原则然后根据实际情况作具体处理。这表示会议在向前进展着。西方代表们的不现实不合理的主张碰壁了，虽然还不能说他们已完全放弃这种主张。
    秘密会议的详细情况不得而知，但在这个问题上史密斯和皮杜尔的主张是很清楚的，他们在印度支那问题一般辩论中已谈到了，例如五月八日皮杜尔先生在发言中曾说“法国政府已经完全地毫无保留地承认了越南、寮国和高棉的独立，战争就成为没有意义的了，同时很久以来法国政府就表示了愿意获得合理的停止敌对行动的解决办法，这就是日内瓦会议的首要任务。至于政治问题，三个联邦成员国的政府才有资格来提这些问题，它们将表现它们的意见，在战争结束之后寻求解决的办法”。
    这是多么虚伪和狡猾的态度啊，从皮杜尔和史密斯的几次发言中人们可以看出他们的主要论点是印度支那三国已经完全“独立”了，今天的战争在寮国和高棉是“越盟的侵略”，在越南是“内战”，因之“只要越盟从寮国和高棉撤退”只要在越南停了战那么一切都是“简单”的，一切都可完事大吉了。这就是说根据西方代表们的意见会议应当只谈军事不谈政治，先把寮国和高棉问题单独处理，寮国和高棉两国的“越盟军队”应完全撤退，两国抗战政府和军队完全消灭。用五月十七日的美国
  “基督教科学箴言报”的话来说“西方国家的代表们被指盼采取共同的立场来反对任何将印度支那停火问题与政治解决相结合的计划，并坚持会议的直接的任务是达到没有任何附带条件的停止冲突”。
    在评论这种光谈停火不谈政治的“战略计划”时，许多正直的法国报纸都说它是殖民主义者的缓兵之计。早在五月十四日讨论印度支那问题的第四次会议上，莫洛托夫外长就指出“日内瓦会议不能把这一任务作这样的理解：把印度支那敌对行动的停止，变成替希望利用它来准备扩大印度支那战争的一方狡猾地安排的喘息机会。”
    本来在莫洛托夫外长以中立国监督停战和有关各国共同保证协议的履行两项建议补充了范文同代外长的提案，从而为举行秘密会议以具体协商解决办法之后，在第一次秘密会议上代表们已同意了莫洛托夫关于会议程序的建议，这给秘密会议提供了一个良好的开端。但是在第二次秘密会议上，西方国家的代表们又横生枝节，提出一个先行单独处理寮国和高棉问题的无理主张，企图强迫会议接受。尽管他们在会内强词夺理，在会外虚声恫吓，但是他们的计划并没有得逞，只是耽误了会议的进展，使宝贵的四天时间白白浪费了。
    从西方记者透露的昨天会议的情况看来，西方的代表们似乎体会到单是恫吓欺诈已不济于事，不得不把他们的先行单独处理寮国和高棉问题的荒谬主张收回去，也不得不接受莫洛托夫外长的建议继续谈下去。昨天秘密会议的进展生动地说明要想把任何不现实的不合理的主张强加于会议是行不通的。
    一般舆论认为现在的问题首先是西方国家的代表们特别是法国代表是否肯认真地面对现实。什么是今天印度支那的现实呢？五月二十一日代表相当一部分法国资产阶级意见的巴黎“世界报”的日内瓦记者这样说“皮杜尔先生拒绝讨论政治问题，但只有考虑到现实的情况一切谈判才能进行，一切协议才能达成。为亚洲中立国家所证实了的为英国所承认了的现实是越盟之所以有力量，首先就是由于它所进行的斗争是代表了民族的意志的，因之只有当它已从法国方面得到关于越南统一和给予越南人民选择他们自己的政权的自由的正式保证后，越盟才能放下武器，并放弃对它有利的军事情况”。这就是说必须考虑印度支那人民的争取和平、民族独立和自由权利的不可扼制的意志以及殖民主义的必须停止，才是面对现实的态度。
    现在在估计日内瓦会议关于讨论印度支那问题的进展时，人们不能不注意到在会场内外从日内瓦到华盛顿害怕和平和阴谋扩大印度支那战争的人们的破坏活动。最近的经验证明：每当会议有了一些进展，这些势力就忙着在前进的路上放置障碍。不是吗，当奠边府的撤退伤员问题达成协议，世界特别是法国人民方庆和平有望时，这个协定就马上被撕毁，开始了法国殖民军的大规模的违约轰炸；当会议由于莫洛托夫外长的努力提出了关于实施印度支那停战方案的中立国监督和国际保证方案时，美国当局又着慌了，他们马上就利用参加监督朝鲜停战的瑞士和瑞典委员的不公正的信件制造中立国监督行不通的空气，以毒化社会舆论。今后在会议进一步向前进展时，他们的阴谋和破坏活动的进一步加强是可以想像的。
    据报纸披露，昨天的秘密会议上，已决定下次会议将在下星期一继续举行，预料届时将进入具体问题的讨论，从范文同代外长和皮杜尔的两个建议以及莫洛托夫的补充建议的内容中可以看出，关于军事停战问题的讨论将包括全面停火、双方军队驻扎地区的调整、停止自印度支那境外运入增援性的兵员以及军事装备和物资、与由交战双方代表所组成的混合委员会监督停战协定条款的执行的同时，由中立国委员会加以监督的问题；日内瓦会议的参加者提供保证的问题。这些问题的复杂性是显而易见的。但是只要有关各方本着谋求解决的诚意也是不难达成协议的。
    但是现有种种迹象说明：某些西方国家的有势力人士仍然没有放弃他们的老主意，他们仍然漠视印度支那人民的民族权利，仍然不肯面对现实，仍然企图保持殖民统治，仍然力图阻挠日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成公正合理的协议，仍然加速旨在扩大印度支那战争的准备，就在三天以前，华盛顿传出消息说：东南亚侵略集团正在积极组织之中，美国决心要在六月底准备完成……。巴黎“解放报”说：“现在有人想进行外交上的虚声恫吓，进行威胁，企图使得胡志明能够提出较好的条件来”。五月十九日的伦敦“泰晤士报”也说：“法国方面……相信美国军队可能参战的恫吓将对共产党人在日内瓦谈判的意愿发生作用，但是在华盛顿，人们怀疑是否杜勒斯先生的恫吓在将来会像在过去那样严重地被考虑”。
    当然威胁恫吓绝不能动摇争取民族独立的印度支那人民的意志，要用这种手段来操纵日内瓦会议，在过去几个星期中已证明失败了，今后也不能期望产生对玩火者有利的结果。
    现实是无情的，但又是必须面对的。对于以美国扩大干涉印度支那战争为目标并用阴谋诡计来拖延和破坏日内瓦会议的一些法国当权者们来说，继续玩火只能得到一个烧毁自己的结果。
                            （五月二十二日）
