CCP Central Propaganda Department Propaganda Outline Regarding Labor Production for Senior Primary and Junior Secondary School Graduates

I. The Purpose and Tasks of Primary and Secondary Education

(I) Currently, a prevalent misconception exists in society: it is believed that all graduates of middle and primary schools should continue their education. If they cannot, engaging in industrial or agricultural production, or other labor, is considered a failure, leading to pessimism, disappointment, and even complaints against the People's Government. This is an extremely unhealthy and erroneous idea. The essence of this idea is the underestimation of physical labor and physical laborers, regarding physical labor as a lowly pursuit. This represents a feudal and bourgeois viewpoint. Over the past four years, our educational leadership organs have failed to recognize the harm of this ideology in middle and primary school education, and have not conducted thorough and systematic criticism of it, which constitutes a principled error.

(II) The educational undertaking of the new China aims to cultivate the younger generation into comprehensively developed members of socialist society, enabling them to strive for the construction of a great socialist country. Lenin once stated: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and primary condition for ensuring the victory of a new social system." The task of education in the new China is to improve the people's labor productivity, which begins with educating the people to have a socialist attitude towards labor, viewing labor as a glorious undertaking, and as the natural duty of those capable of labor. Therefore, our education is absolutely inseparable from labor production. Whether one graduates from primary school, secondary school, or university, they should actively engage in labor production, becoming builders of socialist society with political awareness and cultural cultivation.

(III) Our primary education is compulsory national education. That is to say, in the coming years, we must gradually ensure that every child of school age can receive primary education. The purpose of universal education is to raise the cultural level of the broad masses of working people, so that future workers, peasants, and other laborers will have a certain level of political awareness and cultural education, and can have a better work attitude, and be able to better master technology, becoming skilled workers in industry and agriculture, in the construction of the great socialist cause. Before secondary education becomes universal, only a small proportion of primary school graduates can advance to secondary school. The task of our secondary education at this stage, in addition to supplying some new students for higher education, is also to raise the cultural level of the people and to supply labor with higher political and cultural levels than primary school graduates for national construction. In the Soviet Union, it is very common for secondary school graduates to work as workers. For example, in 1953, 70 percent of the technical workers at the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow were graduates of ten-year secondary schools (equivalent to our high school level); many secondary school graduates also participated in agricultural production. This is not a strange thing.

II. The People's Government Has Actively Developed People's Education Over the Past Four Years

(I) After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Government, in accordance with the cultural and educational policies in the Common Program, actively restored and developed cultural and educational undertakings. Over the past four years, although the state has had major expenditures for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production and transportation, with the restoration and development of production, the state's expenditures on cultural and educational construction have increased significantly year by year. If we take the social and cultural expenditures in 1950 as 100, then it was 177.91 in 1951; 295.70 in 1952; and 460.89 in 1953. In three years, the expenditures on cultural and educational construction increased by more than three and a half times. The number of schools and students has also increased significantly. Speaking only of secondary and primary schools, in 1949, there were more than 346,700 primary schools (including senior and junior primary schools), with more than 24.39 million students. By the end of 1953, there were more than 500,000 schools, with more than 50 million students. The number of schools increased by about 50 percent, and the number of students increased by more than double, more than double the highest number during the Kuomintang rule in 1946. In 1949, there were 5,216 secondary schools, with more than 1.27 million students. By the end of 1953, there were 5,926 schools, with more than 3.62 million students. The number of schools increased by more than 13 percent, and the number of students increased by more than 185 percent, also greatly exceeding the highest number during the Kuomintang rule. From these figures, it can be seen that there are far more students who can attend primary school and secondary school now than in the past.

(II) The People's Government has established the policy of opening education to workers and peasants, and has taken various measures to create favorable conditions for workers and peasants and their children to attend school. For example, schools are established in industrial and mining areas and rural areas to facilitate the enrollment of workers' and peasants' children; people's scholarships are set up in secondary and higher education institutions to first provide financial assistance to workers, peasants, and other working people when they enroll; and worker-peasant rapid middle schools are established to improve the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youth. At the same time, appropriate care is given to the enrollment of children from other classes. After the masses of workers and peasants and their children have obtained more educational opportunities, the composition of students at all levels of schools has also undergone great changes. Now, not only do workers, peasants, and other working people's children account for the vast majority of students in primary schools, but the proportion of workers and peasants in secondary schools and universities is also increasing year by year. According to 1952 statistics, workers' and peasants' children accounted for more than 80 percent of the total number of primary school students, more than 57 percent of the total number of secondary school students, and about 22 percent of the total number of students in national universities in 1953. It can be confidently believed that the proportion of the masses of workers and peasants and other working people's children in schools at all levels will gradually increase in the future. This situation has never happened in history. The days when working people were deprived of the right to education in the reactionary ruling era are gone forever. This situation also shows the importance attached by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government to the cultivation and education of the younger generation.

III. The Improvement of People's Cultural Level Must Be Built on the Basis of Production Development

(I) Of course, the development of education over the past four years is far from meeting the needs of the people. However, it must be understood that without the foundation of production development, the people's education cannot be developed in isolation. The above-mentioned developments over the past four years are mainly due to the Communist Party and the People's Government's vigorous restoration and development of the national economy in the past four years, which has provided the necessary material basis for the development of culture and education. In 1952, the output of major industrial and agricultural products mostly exceeded the highest annual output in China's history. The total output value of industry in 1952 (calculated at constant prices) increased by about 28 percent compared with 1951; in terms of agriculture, taking the total harvest of grain and cotton as 100, the figures for 1952 were 145 for grain and 291 for cotton. Because industrial and agricultural production have been restored and developed, the country's financial and economic situation has improved, and the people's living standards have improved compared to the past, the state has been able to increase certain funds to open more schools, appropriately meet the people's cultural needs, and the people also have greater power to support their children to go to school.

(II) However, the state cannot currently allow all junior and senior primary school graduates to continue their education. The reason is very clear, because how many schools to run and to what extent to improve the people's cultural level cannot be done out of thin air, but must gradually develop with the development of the entire production. Therefore, in order to improve the people's material and cultural living standards, we must first concentrate our main forces on gradually realizing socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Only when the production of industry and agriculture gradually develops can the state have more manpower and material resources to run schools and recruit more students. This means that education and national production must be gradually developed according to a certain plan and a certain proportion. The practical experience of the Soviet Union over the past decades has fully proved this point. After the October Revolution, for a considerable period of time, the Soviet Union saved all expenditures (including savings in education funds) and concentrated its efforts on socialist industrialization first. After 13 years, by 1930, economic construction had made great progress (the total industrial output at the end of 1932 increased to 334 percent compared with the pre-revolution level, and the number of peasant households participating in collective farms reached more than 60 percent of the total number of peasant households in the country.) Only then did they begin to popularize compulsory education. By 1934, the Soviet Union had initially popularized four-year primary compulsory education in rural areas, and initially popularized seven-year compulsory education in cities and industrial and mining areas. After the completion of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, in order to smoothly transition to communism, it was necessary to further improve the national culture. Therefore, in 1939, it was proposed to popularize ten-year education in cities and industrial and mining areas and seven-year education in rural areas. After more than ten years, it was not fully completed by 1953. And what is the current situation in our country? Although industrial and agricultural production in our country has made great progress in recent years, the stage of recovery of the national economy has just passed, and planned economic construction has only entered its second year. Generally speaking, it is still a backward agricultural country in terms of production. In 1952, the output value of modern industry using machines accounted for about 28 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural production, and agricultural production could not universally adopt advanced production technologies in a short period of time. It is still far behind the production level of the Soviet Union from 1932 to 1933. On such a production basis, primary education cannot be quickly popularized throughout the country. At present, it is obviously not commensurate with the development of production to want all senior primary school graduates to enter junior high school and all junior high school graduates to enter senior high school.

(III) The development of cultural and educational undertakings cannot be separated from the original foundation. The foundation left to us by the old China in this aspect is very weak, and there are many limitations in terms of subjective conditions. In the past few years, due to the development of middle and primary schools, the lack of teachers has become an extremely serious problem, especially the lack of teachers in secondary and higher education institutions. In the past few years, in addition to assigning some university graduates to teach in middle schools, the main reliance has been on short-term training of unemployed intellectuals and promoting outstanding primary school teachers to serve as middle school teachers. However, the phenomenon of teacher shortage has not been fundamentally solved. It takes a certain amount of time to train qualified new teachers. Therefore, the development of our middle and primary school education must also proceed steadily from the current cultural and educational foundation. If we blindly increase the number of schools without considering possible subjective conditions, we will inevitably fail to run the schools well, fail to teach the students well, waste the country's and the people's financial resources, and fail to play the due role in national construction. The consequences will be very bad.

IV. Criticism of Several Erroneous Ideas

(I) Some students are unwilling to be workers or peasants, thinking that working and farming are "too dirty," "too tiring," and "too embarrassing." Many students' parents are also unwilling for their children to be workers or peasants, thinking that since they are still "suffering," why bother going to school. Some teachers also think that it is "unpromising" and "a pity" for students to work and farm. This idea of ​​underestimating physical labor and workers and peasants is extremely wrong. In China's feudal era, there was the erroneous theory that "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" and "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior." This theory still influences teachers and parents to a considerable extent, and thus poisons the vast number of young students. This is a reversal of the truth. Physical labor is the basis of mental labor. Without physical labor and physical laborers, there would be no human world, and naturally there would be no intellectual who relies on mental labor. Everyone knows that without workers doing work, there would be no means of production, no houses to live in, no clothes to wear, no trains, no ships, and no weapons to defend the motherland...etc.; Similarly, without farmers farming the land, there would be no grain and industrial raw materials, and people would not be able to live. In the new China, workers, peasants and other working people have become the masters of the country, and labor has become a glorious and noble cause. The Common Program lists "love of labor" as one of the important contents of national morality. The people of the whole country must respect labor, love labor, and work hard to build our country into a great socialist country, and in the future, we will be able to realize a happy and fulfilling socialist and communist society. Consciously and actively engaging in labor is a virtue for people, and we must educate the younger generation to develop this virtue.

(II) Some people say: High school and junior high school graduates will not become cadres or experts if they do not continue their studies in the future, and will have no future. This statement is also groundless. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, established the people's country, and are now gradually building a socialist society where everyone is rich and universally prosperous. High school and junior high school graduates are the new force in national construction, and of course, like the broad masses of working people, they will have a bright future. It is, of course, justified to want to be a cadre or an expert if it is from the perspective of serving the people. However, true cadres and experts in revolution and construction are not made simply by having a certain level of education and a school diploma. In any case, they must have rich practical experience in revolution and production. If you only graduate from school and have no practical experience, you can only be regarded as a semi-intellectual at best, which is far from enough to be a cadre and an expert. In fact, many of our cadres and experts have been trained through revolutionary and productive practice. Anyone who underestimates physical labor and physical laborers cannot truly become cadres and experts.

(III) Some people think this way: it is promising to engage in industrial labor, but it is the most "unpromising" to engage in agriculture. This idea is also wrong. To realize the country's socialist industrialization, agriculture must be developed accordingly. Without the development of agricultural production, there would be no guarantee for grain and industrial raw materials. Therefore, engaging in agricultural production is equally glorious. If we look at the long term, our rural areas have already begun to embark on the road of cooperativization. In the future, many large agricultural production cooperatives will be established, and gradually we will live a happy and prosperous life like the collective farms in the Soviet Union. But all the wonderful prospects cannot be waited for, but must be strived for through our hard work. At present, junior high school and high school graduates who grow up in rural areas and cannot continue their studies should mainly engage in agricultural production, promote the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in production, and gradually train themselves into production experts and backbones in the agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation movement in production labor. Xu Jianchun, an eighteen-year-old high school graduate from Hou Lü Village, Guoxi District, Laiye County, Shandong Province, has become a well-known labor model in the province because of his good work. Zhang Shumei, a female high school graduate from Chaoshui Township, Penglai County, Shandong Province, used chemical fertilizers according to the method of applying chemical fertilizers, and as a result, the millet grew very well. In the past, when planting corn in class 18 land, the densest was only 1,500 plants per mu. Zhang Shumei adopted the method of dense planting on wide ridges, leaving 2,000 plants per mu, and as a result, each mu of corn yielded nearly 100 catties more. She made an important contribution to the improvement of agricultural production. There are more such facts in the Soviet Union. For example, in 1952, the Chinese Farmers Delegation visited the "Red October" collective farm in the Caucasus, Soviet Union, and met a young female labor model, Mirzoyeva. She participated in agricultural labor in 1941 and also served as the production team leader. Her team was the best in the entire farm. In 1949, this team harvested an average of 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu, and she received the Labor Red Banner Medal. In 1950, this team harvested an average of 1,107 catties of seed cotton per mu, and she received the Lenin Medal. Mirzoyeva is just one of thousands of labor models. Such examples are endless.

(IV) Some students worry that after engaging in labor production, they will abandon their studies and will no longer be able to learn culture and technology. We believe that if the attitude towards work and study is correct, then this worry is also unnecessary. When we study in school, the main task is to study, and we can certainly learn many knowledge and skills, but it does not mean that once we leave school and engage in labor production, we can stop learning and not learn anything. On the contrary, after engaging in labor production, we should continue to work hard to learn, and we can also learn many important knowledge and experiences. We can learn knowledge of industrial and agricultural production in our work, and study production technologies and working methods; we can make up for culture in our spare time, participate in various political and cultural activities, and constantly improve our political and cultural level. As long as we work hard, we can also have creativity in our work, contribute to social and cultural activities, and have achievements in our studies. Moreover, after participating in labor, spare-time study is very important for everyone. Many people who have achieved success in their careers and academics in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, have relied on their long-term hard work while working. For example, there are many comrades in our revolutionary ranks who have not received school education in the past or have only received primary and secondary school education. Because they have worked hard to study in the revolutionary struggle for a long time and have constantly improved their knowledge and abilities, they are now working in important positions. For example, in China's industrial and agricultural production, there are many workers and peasants who work hard to study culture and research technology. Some constantly improve their knowledge and skills, gradually master modern science and technology, and become people with specialized knowledge and technology; some have made inventions and creations in production and become innovators in production. Zhao Zhankui, Wang Chonglun, Hao Jianxiu, etc. in industrial production, and Li Shunda, Guo Yuen, Wu Chun'an, etc., who recently received the "Patriotic Abundance Gold Star Medal" in agricultural production, are all well-known labor models in the country. The Soviet Union has produced more industrial and agricultural heroes and models in the construction process over the past decades. Many outstanding workers and peasants have become very accomplished people in production and academia because of the country's training and their own hard work.

V. The Responsibilities of Teachers and Parents

Every teacher and parent hopes that their students and children can be cultivated into useful talents who can contribute to the country and the people. This hope is consistent with the country's hope. But after we understand the above-mentioned principles, how should we educate students and children to take the correct path based on correct views and the actual situation?

(I) We understand the purpose and tasks of middle and primary school education, understand the truth that the development of culture and education must be adapted to the development of production, and understand that the greatest contribution to the country and the people is to strive to realize socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Then, we should strengthen labor education for students. When teachers and parents carry out education on weekdays, they should explain the meaning and value of labor to the children from all aspects, so that the children can realize from the ideological level that labor is a glorious and noble undertaking; labor is the source of all civilized and happy life; guide children to appropriately participate in productive labor that helps intellectual and physical development, so that children can cultivate healthy and hard-working physique, tenacious and unyielding will, a spirit of observing labor discipline, and a habit of loving labor in labor. In order to dedicate themselves to the great cause of building socialism, they must make the children understand that the ultimate goal of learning is to better engage in productive labor, should work hard to study, and prepare to engage in production and construction. After graduation, they should be trained into heroes and models on the labor production front. But it is also necessary to prevent some deviations from arising due to carrying out labor education, such as not daring to talk to children about continuing their studies, making inappropriate criticisms of children's legitimate aspirations and ideals, asking children to engage in labor that they cannot handle, and adopting a movement-like or rigid attitude in carrying out labor education.

(II) Teachers and parents should not unilaterally educate students and children that they must continue their studies, because our national economy has not reached the level where everyone can go to middle school. This requirement cannot be fully realized at present, and they should not think that it is a disgrace to teachers and parents if students fail to pass the middle school entrance examination. In the past, some parents blamed or even beat and scolded their children because their children failed to pass the middle school entrance examination, which caused great stimulation to the children's spirits and made them feel very sad, and they were even more unwilling to engage in labor production. There is no benefit in doing so. The correct approach should be: students should take the entrance examination if they want to continue their studies. If they fail to pass the examination, teachers and parents should comfort them, explain the principles mentioned above, and encourage them to actively engage in productive labor, and work hard to learn technology and improve their culture in the process of productive labor.

(III) Since our planned economic construction has just begun, the industrial production of some cities is not yet developed, and the number of new workers currently needed by factories is not very large. In addition, the high school and junior high school graduates in cities are relatively young. Therefore, it is very likely that some students in cities who cannot continue their studies will not be able to engage in industrial production for the time being. In this case, in addition to the fact that government cultural and educational departments and youth and children's organizations such as the Youth League and the Young Pioneers should take various possible measures to actively help them, it is particularly necessary for parents to recognize this temporary difficulty in the country's victorious progress, take a responsible attitude, consider appropriate work for their children, or guide them to help the family do some work and study at home, to prepare for future work and study. It is absolutely forbidden to adopt a laissez-faire attitude and let the children idle around. This responsible attitude is beneficial to the country and the children, and is extremely necessary.

(IV) Local cadres, especially district and township cadres, are responsible for various responsible tasks in the local area, have close ties with the masses, and have great prestige among the masses. They should first study the various issues mentioned above clearly, combine them with the specific local conditions, carry out propaganda and education for teachers, students, and parents, and help solve the problems of students who cannot continue their studies to engage in production and participate in work, so that they can happily participate in various possible productive labor or other work.

### 中共中央宣传部关于高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产宣传提纲

1954-05-29

专栏：

    中共中央宣传部关于高小和初中毕业生从事劳动生产宣传提纲
    一、中小学教育的目的和任务
    （一）目前社会上流行一种错误的看法：认为现在的中、小学毕业生都应当升学，不能升学而去从事工业农业生产或其他劳动就是失学，因而就悲观失望，甚至抱怨人民政府。这是一种极不健康的错误的思想。这个思想的实质，就是轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者，把体力劳动作为下贱的事业。这是一种封建阶级和资产阶级的观点。四年来，我们教育领导机关在中、小学教育中，没有认识到这种思想的危害性，没有对这种思想进行深刻的系统的批判，是一个原则性的错误。
      （二）新中国的学校教育事业，是要培养青年一代成为社会主义社会全面发展的成员，使他们能为建设伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。列宁曾经说过：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”新中国教育的任务，就是为提高人民的劳动生产率，这首先就是教育人民要具有社会主义的劳动态度，把劳动看成光荣的事业，把劳动看成为有劳动能力的人的天职。因此，我们的教育和劳动生产是绝对不可分离的，不论从小学、中学或大学毕业出来的人，都应该积极从事劳动生产，成为有政治觉悟，有文化教养的社会主义社会的建设者。
    （三）我们的小学教育，是国民义务教育性质。就是说，在今后若干年内，要逐步做到每一个达到入学年龄的儿童都能受到小学教育。普及教育的目的就是为了提高广大劳动人民的文化水平，使今后的工人、农民及其他劳动者，都有一定的政治觉悟和文化教养，在建设伟大的社会主义事业中，能有更好的劳动态度，能够更好地掌握技术，成为工业、农业中的生产能手。在中学成为普及教育以前，小学毕业生升中学当然只能是一小部分人。现阶段我们中学教育的任务，除去为高等学校输送一部分新生以外，同样是为了提高人民的文化水平，为国家各项建设事业供应政治水平、文化程度比小学毕业生为高的劳动力。在苏联，中学毕业生作工人是极普通的事情。例如一九五三年莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂的技术工人有百分之七十是十年制中学毕业生（相当我们的高中程度）；也有很多中学毕业生参加了农业生产。这并不是什么奇怪的事情。
    二、四年来人民政府积极发展了
      人民教育事业
    （一）中华人民共和国成立后，人民政府根据共同纲领中的文化教育政策，积极恢复和发展了文化教育事业。四年来，国家虽然有抗美援朝、恢复和发展工农业生产和交通运输等的重大开支，但随着生产的恢复和发展，国家的文教建设经费还是逐年大量增加，如果以一九五○年开支的社会文教经费为一百，一九五一年就是一百七十七点九一；一九五二年是二百九十五点七○；一九五三年是四百六十点八九。三年当中，文教建设经费增加了三倍半还多。学校和学生的数目都有大量增加，单讲中等学校和小学，在一九四九年，小学校数（包括高小、初小）有三十四万六千七百多所，学生有二千四百三十九万多人，到一九五三年底就有学校五十万多所，学生五千多万人，学校约增加了百分之五十，学生约增加了一倍以上，学生数比一九四六年国民党统治时期最高数增加了一倍多；中等学校在一九四九年有五千二百一十六所，学生有一百二十七万多人，到一九五三年底就有学校五千九百二十六所，学生三百六十二万多人，学校增加了百分之十三以上，学生增加了百分之一百八十五以上，也大大超过了国民党统治时期的最高数量。从这些数字看来，现在能上小学、能升中学的学生比过去多得多了。
      （二）人民政府确定了教育向工农开门的方针，并采取了种种措施为工农及其子女入学创造有利条件。如在工矿区和农村增办学校以便利工农子女入学；在中等以上学校设置人民助学金，首先使工农及其他劳动人民子女入学时得到经济上的帮助；创办工农速成中学，提高工农干部和工农青年的文化水平。同时，对其他阶层的子女入学也有适当的照顾。工农群众及其子女获得了更多受教育的机会以后，各级学校中学生的成分也就发生了很大的变化。现在不仅小学校里工农及其他劳动人民子女占绝大多数，中学、大学学生中的工农成分也是在逐年增加。根据一九五二年统计，工农子女在小学学生总数中约占百分之八十以上，在中等学校学生总数中占百分之五十七以上，一九五三年全国高等学校里工农成分的学生占学生总数的百分之二十二左右。可以肯定相信，今后工农群众及其他劳动人民子女在各级学校中的比例数还会逐步上升。这种情况是历史上从来没有过的，反动统治时代，劳动人民被剥夺受教育权利的日子是永远过去了。这种情况也说明中国共产党和人民政府对培养和教育青年一代的重视。
  三、人民文化水平的提高必须
      建筑在生产发展的基础上
      （一）当然，四年来教育事业的发展还远不能满足人民群众的要求。但是，必须明白，没有生产发展做基础，人民教育事业是不可能孤立地发展的。上述四年来这些发展，主要是由于共产党和人民政府在过去四年中，大力恢复和发展了国民经济，使文化教育的发展获得了必要的物质基础。一九五二年，工农业的主要产品产量绝大部分已超过了我国历史上的最高年产量。工业在一九五二年的总产值（按不变价格计算）就比一九五一年约增长百分之二十八；农业方面单就粮食和棉花来说，如以其总收获量各为一百，一九五二年粮食为一百四十五，棉花为二百九十一。因为工农业生产得到恢复和发展，国家的财政经济情况好转了，人民的生活水平比过去提高了，国家才能增加一定的经费多开办些学校，适当地满足人民的文化要求，人民也才有较大力量供自己的子女上学。
      （二）但是，目前国家还不能使初中和高小毕业生全部升学。道理很清楚，因为要办多少学校，把人民文化水平提高到什么程度，不是凭空就能办得到的，必须随着整个生产的发展而逐步发展。所以，为了提高人民的物质生活与文化生活的水平，必须首先集中主要的力量来逐步实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，只有使工农业的生产逐步发展起来，国家才能有更多的人力、物力来办学校，招收更多的学生。这就是说，教育事业和国家生产事业必须按着一定的计划、一定的比例逐步发展。苏联几十年来的实际经验已经充分证明了这一点。十月革命以后，在相当长的时间内，苏联节省一切开支（包括教育经费的节省），集中力量先搞社会主义工业化。过了十三年，到一九三○年，经济建设有了巨大的发展（一九三二年末的工业总产量比革命前水准增加到了百分之三百三十四，参加集体农庄的农户已达全国农户总数的百分之六十以上。）才着手普及义务教育。到一九三四年，苏联在农村才初步普及了四年制的初等义务教育，在城市和工矿区初步普及了七年制的义务教育。苏联社会主义建设完成以后，为了顺利地向共产主义过渡，必须进一步提高国民文化，因此，一九三九年提出在城市和工矿区普及十年制的教育，在乡村普及七年制教育。经过十几年，到一九五三年还没有完全完成。而我国目前的情况又是怎样呢？我国近几年来虽然工业、农业生产有了很大的进步，但国民经济的恢复阶段刚刚过去，有计划的经济建设方才进入第二年，总起来说，还是一个生产落后的农业国，一九五二年使用机器的现代工业的产值约占工农业生产总值的百分之二十八左右，农业生产短期间还不能普遍采用进步的生产技术。比起苏联一九三二年到一九三三年的生产水平还差得很远。在这样的生产基础上，小学教育还不可能在全国范围内很快地普及，目前要想使全部高小毕业生都升初中和全部初中毕业生都升高中，显然和生产发展情况是不相称的。　
      （三）文化教育事业的发展，也不能离开原有的基础，旧中国遗留给我们的这一方面的基础是十分薄弱的，在主观条件上有很多限制。过去几年来，由于中、小学校的发展，师资缺乏已成为极严重的问题，尤其是中等以上学校师资更为缺乏。几年来，除分配一部分高等学校毕业生到中学当教师外，主要靠短期训练失业知识分子和提拔优秀小学教师任中学教师。但教师的缺乏现象仍未根本解决。培养合格的新教师是需要一定的时间的，所以我们的中、小学教育的发展，也必须从目前文化教育基础出发，稳步前进。如果不顾主观可能条件，盲目增设学校，势必办不好学校，教不好学生，浪费国家与人民的财力，对国家建设起不了应有的作用，其后果是很不好的。
      四、批判几种错误思想
      （一）有些学生不愿当工人、农民，认为做工、种地“太脏”、“太累”、“太丢人”。许多学生的家长，也不愿意自己子弟去当工人或农民，认为既然还是“受苦”，又何必去读书。有些教师也认为学生去作工、种地，是“没出息”，而且也“很可惜”。这种轻视体力劳动、轻视工农的思想，是极端错误的。中国封建时代有所谓“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的错误理论，这种理论还在不小程度上影响着现在的教师和家长，因而也就毒害着广大的青年学生。这是把真理颠倒了过来的说法，体力劳动才是脑力劳动的基础，没有体力劳动，没有体力劳动者，就没有人类世界，自然也不能有脑力劳动的知识分子。大家都知道，如果没有工人做工，就没有生产工具，没有房子住，没有衣服穿，没有火车、轮船，也就没有武器来保卫祖国……等；同样，如果没有农民种地，就没有粮食和工业原料，人们也就无法生活。在新中国，工农及其他劳动人民已经成为国家的主人，劳动成为光荣、崇高的事业。在共同纲领里把“爱劳动”列为国民公德的重要内容之一。全国人民必须尊重劳动，热爱劳动，努力生产建设，才能把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，将来也才能实现幸福美满的社会主义和共产主义社会。自觉地、积极地从事劳动，是人们的一种美德，必须教育青年一代养成这种美德。
      （二）有人说：高小和初中毕业生不升学，将来当不成干部，当不成专家，就没有前途。这话也是毫无根据的。中国人民在共产党、毛主席领导下，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，建立人民的国家，现正逐步在建设大家富裕和普遍繁荣的社会主义社会。高小和初中毕业生都是国家建设的新生力量，当然和广大劳动人民一样都会有光明前途的。想当干部、当专家，如果是从为人民服务的观点出发，当然是正当的。但真正的革命和建设的干部和专家，并不是单单有了文化程度，有了学校毕业证书就成的，无论如何都必须有丰富的革命和生产的实践经验。如果仅仅由学校毕业，没有实践经验，至多只能算半知识分子，远远不够作干部和专家。事实上，我们许多干部和专家是从革命和生产实践中锻炼出来的。任何轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者的人，都不可能真正成为干部和专家。
      （三）有人这样想：从事工业劳动有前途，但搞农业最“没出息”。这种想法也是错误的。实现国家社会主义工业化，一定要相应地发展农业，不发展农业生产，粮食和工业原料就没有保证。所以从事农业生产，同样是光荣的。如果把眼光往远处看，我们的农村已经开始走上合作化的道路，将来成立许多大的农业生产合作社，逐步就要像苏联的集体农庄一样，人人过着美好幸福的生活。但所有美好的前途都不能坐着等待，而要经过我们的艰苦奋斗去努力争取。目前生长在农村不能升学的初中、高小毕业生主要应当从事农业生产，推进生产互助合作运动，使自己在生产劳动中逐步锻炼成为生产能手和农业互助合作运动中的骨干。山东掖县过西区后吕村十八岁的高小毕业生徐建春，因为劳动好，已经成为全省知名的劳动模范了。山东蓬莱县潮水乡高小毕业的女生张淑梅，根据施化学肥料的办法，使用化学肥料，结果谷子长得很好。过去种棒子在十八级地里每亩最密才种一千五百棵，张淑梅采取密植办法，每亩宽垄密植留两千棵，结果每亩棒子多收了近一百斤。她对于改良农业生产作了重要的贡献。在苏联这一类的事实更多，例如一九五二年中国农民代表参观团参观苏联高加索“红十月”集体农庄，遇到一个青年女劳动模范米尔左耶娃，她在一九四一年就参加农业劳动，还当生产组长，她的组是全农庄最好的。在一九四九年，这个组每亩地平均收了一千斤籽棉，她得到劳动红旗奖章，在一九五○年，这个组每亩地平均收了一千一百零七斤籽棉，她得到了列宁勋章。米尔左耶娃不过是千百个劳动模范中的一个。像这样的例子是举不完的。
    （四）有些学生担心从事劳动生产以后，就要荒废学业，再也不能学习文化和技术了。我们认为，如果对工作和学习所持的态度是正确的，那么，这种担心也是不必要的。我们在学校里求学时代，主要的任务是学习，固然可以学到许多知识技能，但并不是说一旦离开学校从事劳动生产就可以不学习，就不能学到什么了。相反地，从事劳动生产以后，还应当继续努力学习，还可以学到许多重要的知识和经验。我们可以在工作中学习工农业生产的知识，研究生产技术和工作方法；可以在业余时间补习文化，参加各种政治、文化活动，不断提高自己的政治、文化水平。只要自己努力，一样可以在劳动中有创造，在社会文化活动中有贡献，在学业上有成就。而且参加劳动以后的业余学习，对于每个人都是非常重要的，古今中外许多在事业上和学术上有成就的人都是靠自己长期一面劳动一面苦学出来的。例如，我们革命队伍里有很多同志，过去没有受过学校教育或仅仅受过小学、中学教育，由于他们在革命斗争中长期努力学习，不断提高自己的知识能力，现在已经在各种岗位上担任重要的工作了。又如，我国工农业生产中，有很多工人农民在工作当中努力学习文化、研究技术，有的不断提高自己的知识技能，逐渐掌握现代科学技术，成为有专门知识和技术的人；有的在生产上有了发明创造，成为生产中的革新者，工业生产中的赵占魁、王崇伦、郝建秀等，农业生产中最近得到“爱国丰产金星奖章”的李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安等都是全国知名的劳动模范。苏联在过去几十年的建设过程中，涌现出更多工业和农业的英雄模范。有很多优秀的工人农民，由于国家的培养和自己努力的学习已经成为在生产上、在学术上很有成就的人了。
      五、教师和家长的责任
    每个教师和家长，都希望自己的学生和自己的孩子能够培养成为有用的人材，对国家对人民有所贡献，这种希望和国家的希望是一致的。但是我们明白了上面所说的道理以后，如何根据正确的观点和现实情况来教育学生和子弟走上正确的道路呢？
      （一）我们明白了中、小学教育的目的和任务，明白了文化教育的发展必须和生产发展相适应的道理，明白了对国家对人民最大的贡献就是努力实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造。那末，就应该对学生加强劳动教育，平日教师和家长在进行教育的时候，就应该从各方面把劳动的意义和价值向孩子们讲清楚，使孩子们从思想上认识到劳动是光荣、崇高的事业；劳动是一切文明幸福生活的来源；指导孩子们适当地参加有助于智力体力发展的生产劳动，使孩子们在劳动中培养锻炼出健康耐劳的体格、坚韧不屈的意志、遵守劳动纪律的精神和爱好劳动的习惯。以便献身于建设社会主义的伟大事业，要使孩子们明白学习的最终目的就是为了更好地从事生产劳动，应当努力学习，准备从事生产建设。毕业以后，在劳动生产战线上锻炼成为英雄、模范。但也要防止因为进行劳动教育而产生一些偏向，如不敢向孩子谈升学问题，对孩子的正当志愿和理想提出不适当的批评，叫孩子从事力不胜任的劳动，在进行劳动教育当中采取搞运动的方式或生硬态度等。
      （二）教师和家长都不能片面教育学生和子女非升学不行，因为我们的国民经济还没有达到人人都能上中学的水平，这个要求目前是不可能完全实现的，更不能认为学生考不取中学，就替教师、家长丢脸。过去有的家长因子女考不取中学而责备孩子甚至打骂孩子，使孩子们的精神上受到很大的刺激，心里非常难过，更加不愿劳动生产。这样做法，是没有什么好处的。正确的作法，应当是：学生要升学就去投考，如果考不取，教师和家长应该安慰他们，向他们讲清上面所讲的道理，鼓励他们积极从事生产劳动，在生产劳动的过程中努力学习技术和提高文化。
      （三）由于我们有计划的经济建设刚刚开始，有些城市工业生产还不发达，工厂里目前所需要增加新工人的数目还不很多，加上城市里高小和初中毕业生的年纪比较幼小，因此，在城市里也就很可能有部分不能升学的学生暂时还不可能从事工业生产。在这种情况下，除掉政府文教部门和青年团、少先队等青年、儿童团体应采取各种可能办法积极加以帮助外，就特别需要家长们认识国家胜利前进中的这一暂时困难，采取负责态度，给孩子考虑适当的工作，或指导他们帮助家庭做一部分工作和在家自修，为今后的工作、学习做好准备，切不可采取自由放任的态度，让孩子们游手好闲。这种负责的态度对于国家对于孩子都是有益的，极端必要的。
    （四）地方干部，特别是区、乡干部，在地方上担负着各种负责工作，和群众有着密切的联系，并且在群众中很有威信。应当首先把上面所谈的各种问题研究清楚，结合当地具体情况，向教师、学生、家长进行宣传教育，并帮助解决不能升学的学生从事生产、参加工作问题，使他们愉快地参加各种可能参加的生产劳动或其他工作。
