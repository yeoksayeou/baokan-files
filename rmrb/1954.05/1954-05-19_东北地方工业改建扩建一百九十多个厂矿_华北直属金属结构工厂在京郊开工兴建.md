    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. This year, over 190 state-owned local industrial factories and mines in the Northeast region will be expanded and reconstructed, and nine new factories and mines will be built.

    Among these factories and mines, some are being expanded to meet the needs of state-owned industrial production, such as manganese mines and coal mines. Others are being newly built, renovated, or expanded to meet the needs of people's lives, such as sugar factories, milk powder factories, textile mills, clothing factories, and wineries. The expanded Liaoxi Wafangzi Manganese Mine will supply Anshan Iron and Steel Company with more products. The New China Sugar Factory and Jiamusi Sugar Factory, which began construction in 1953 and are currently under construction, are expected to be completed in 1955. After these two sugar factories are put into production, they will use locally produced sugar beets to produce more than 5,800 tons of sugar annually to meet people's needs. After the expansion of the Acheng Sugar Factory and Hongguang Sugar Factory is completed, the sugar production in the Northeast region will be greatly increased. Jilin Winery will also be slightly expanded this year and will begin producing a new beverage that has recently been successfully trial-produced – Tengju Wine. Tengju is a wild plant that grows in the Changbai Mountains. The wine brewed from it tastes better than wine and costs 10% less than wine. The Harbin Milk Powder Factory, which will begin construction this year, can produce more than 250 tons of high-quality milk powder annually for children in New China after it is completed. The coastal areas of Dalian are rich in various aquatic products such as fish and shrimp. In order to make full use of aquatic products to increase the production of non-staple foods, the Lüda Aquatic Products Company will build six new fishing boats and repair one fishing boat this year. Using these seven fishing boats to fish, more than 4,000 tons of fish can be caught each year. After the equipment of the Lüda Knitting Factory is supplemented and balanced, it is expected to increase the production of 150,000 dozens of woolen sweaters. After the expansion of the Liaodong Silk Spinning Factory is completed, it can process large quantities of the by-product of the Northeast specialty tussah silk – wan shou. This raw material can be made into plush, yarn, and silk floss.

    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The construction project of the North China Directly Subordinate Metal Structure Factory, designed using the latest Soviet standards, began on May 15 in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. After the factory is completed, it will be the largest metal structure factory in North China in terms of production capacity. Its main products, steel beams, roof trusses, and industrial pipelines, will support the industrial construction of Baotou, Taiyuan, and other places.

    Since the factory began construction preparation work in February this year, 80% of the building materials required for the first phase of the project have been prepared, the construction plan and production instruction charts have been studied and discussed by the workers, and temporary projects such as work sheds, water and electricity, and roads have been built.

    While the factory is being built, it has also begun training skilled workers to prepare for production next year.

    东北地方工业改建扩建一百九十多个厂矿
    华北直属金属结构工厂在京郊开工兴建
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北区地方国营工业今年将要扩建、改建一百九十多个工厂和矿山，新建九个工厂和矿山。
    这些厂矿里面，有些是为了适应国营工业生产需要而扩建的，如锰矿和煤矿等。有些是为了适应人民生活需要而新建、改建或扩建的，如糖厂、乳粉厂、纺织厂、服装厂、酒厂等。扩建后的辽西瓦房子锰矿，将以更多的产品供应鞍山钢铁公司的需要。一九五三年动工，目前正在继续建设的新中国制糖厂和佳木斯制糖厂，预计要在一九五五年完工。这两个糖厂投入生产以后，每年将利用当地出产的甜菜，生产五千八百多吨食糖，供应人民需要。扩建的阿城制糖厂、红光糖厂等完工以后，将大大增加东北区糖的产量。吉林葡萄酒厂，今年也要稍加扩大，开始生产最近试制成功的一种新饮料——藤菊酒。藤菊是生长在长白山一带的野生植物，用它酿出来的酒，味道比葡萄酒还美，成本比葡萄酒低百分之十。今年动工新建的哈尔滨乳粉厂建成以后，每年可以为新中国的儿童生产五十万斤以上质量优良的奶粉。大连沿海一带盛产鱼虾等各种水产，为了充分利用水产增加副食品的生产，旅大水产公司今年要新造六只渔船和修复一只渔船。用这七只渔船捕鱼，每年可以多捕八百多万斤鱼。旅大针织厂的设备经过补充和平衡以后，预计可以增产绒衣十五万打。辽东绢纺工厂扩建完工以后，就可以大量处理东北特产柞蚕丝的副产品——挽手。这种原料可以制成长毛绒、纱和丝棉。
    【新华社十八日讯】采用苏联最新标准设计的华北直属金属结构工厂的建厂工程，已在五月十五日在北京市东郊开工兴建。这个工厂建成后将是华北区生产能力最大的金属结构工厂，它的主要产品钢梁、屋架和工业管道等，将支援包头、太原等地的工业建设。
    这个工厂从今年二月开始施工准备工作以来，第一期工程所需用的建筑材料已备好百分之八十，施工计划和生产指示图表已经过工人们学习讨论，工棚、水电、道路等暂时工程已建筑起来。
    在建厂的同时，这个工厂并开始了训练技术工人的工作，以便为明年投入生产做好准备。
