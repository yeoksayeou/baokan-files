Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Hebei Province Actively Promote the Contract System

In order to overcome the phenomenon of wasted work and to further consolidate and improve agricultural production cooperatives, various regions of Hebei Province are actively promoting the contract system.

Various localities are taking the promotion of the contract system very seriously. Some have specially organized cadres to study so as to guide the promotion in various cooperatives; some have organized cooperative cadres to study and implement it by using mutual aid and cooperation networks as units; some have combined learning from contract work experience through competitions and visits. The promotion is generally carried out step by step from point to area, from simple to complex, and from small tasks to large tasks. Small cooperatives implement small-scale contracting, and large and medium-sized cooperatives with a foundation implement seasonal contracting or contracting output. According to statistics from 400 cooperatives in 9 counties including Shexian, Wuqiao, Ningjin, and Jiaohe, before the promotion, only 5 cooperatives implemented temporary contracting. Now, 122 cooperatives have implemented temporary contracting and seasonal contracting. Originally, 120 cooperatives implemented fixed distribution and fixed recording or no recording of work points, but now they have all been changed to flexible recording based on fixed distribution or recording of work points by the piece. After the Baoding Special District conducted a competition and visit, incomplete statistics from only 5 counties including Mancheng and Anxin showed that more than 240 cooperatives implemented temporary contracting and piecework recording.

After the implementation of the contract system, the cooperatives have greatly reversed the phenomenon of wasted work and absenteeism, further inspired the production enthusiasm of the members, and consolidated the cooperatives. For example, in the Song Fagao Cooperative in Lihe Village, Fengfeng Mining Area, there used to be a lot of wasted work, and even the actively working members gradually slackened. After the implementation of the contract system, the members fully exerted their production enthusiasm, and labor efficiency increased by more than two times compared to the past.

    河北省农业生产合作社积极推行包工制
    河北省各地为了克服窝工现象，进一步巩固、提高农业生产合作社，正在积极推行包工制。
    各地对推行包工制都很认真。有的专门组织干部学习，以便指导各社推广；有的以互助合作网为单位，组织社干部研究进行；有的通过评比参观，结合学习包工经验。推广时一般都采取由点到面、由简到繁、由小活到大活逐步推行的方法，小社实行小包工，有基础的大、中社推行季节包工或包工包产。根据涉县、吴桥、宁津、交河等九县四百个社的统计，推广前只有五个社实行临时包工，现在已有一百二十二个社实行临时包工和季节包工，原来有一百二十个社实行死分死记或不记分，现在都改成死分活记或按件记工。保定专区通过评比参观后，仅满城、安新等五县不完全统计，即有二百四十多个社实行了临时包工和按件记工。
    各社实行包工制以后，大大扭转了窝工、旷工现象，进一步鼓舞了社员的生产热情，巩固了合作社。如峰峰矿区立合村宋法高社，过去窝工很多，劳动积极的社员也渐渐松劲。实行包工制以后，社员们充分发挥生产积极性，劳动效率比过去提高了两倍多。
