District and Township Cadres Should Emphasize Absorbing Higher Primary School Graduates to Participate in Agricultural Production
    Liu Shi

It is gratifying that millions of farmers' children in our country graduate from higher primary schools every year. Most of these young people hope to enter middle school for further study, which is a good aspiration. However, inevitably many higher primary school graduates across the country will not be able to enter middle school. The Party and the People's Government have clearly pointed out that it is necessary to guide rural higher primary school graduates who cannot continue their education to participate in agricultural production. Last year, many regions across the country made great efforts to mobilize and organize higher primary school graduates to engage in agricultural production and achieved results. According to incomplete statistics, in the Northeast region alone, more than 140,000 higher primary school graduates participated in agricultural production, of which over 49,000 were in Liaoxi Province, accounting for more than 45 percent of the province's total number of higher primary school graduates. In Shandong Province, most of the higher primary school graduates participated in agricultural production. Of the 2,750 higher primary school graduates in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, 1,839 participated in agricultural production. The experiences in various places have proven that the path pointed out by the Party and the People's Government is indeed a broad path for rural higher primary school graduates, and it also proves that higher primary school graduates engaging in agricultural production is of great significance and role for the country's construction cause. However, last year, due to the fact that we did not do a good job of publicity and organization for this major event related to the vital interests of the people, did not clearly explain the nature and purpose of primary school education, did not explain in detail the necessity and importance of rural higher primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, and some district and township cadres did not have sufficient understanding of the importance of guiding higher primary school graduates to engage in production work, and did not give them the necessary care and encouragement, as a result, many students who did not enter school in many regions had emotional problems, and parents also had opinions. The summer vacation this year is approaching soon. This year, there will be more higher primary school graduates across the country than in previous years, and there will be more people who cannot continue their education. Therefore, it is hoped that all regions across the country, especially the district and township cadres who specifically carry out this task, will make preparations as soon as possible.

District and township grassroots cadres should clearly recognize the significance and role of higher primary school graduates engaging in agricultural production in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture. Our current rural areas have undergone tremendous changes. In the process of gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, "doing farm work" also requires culture. At present, we are engaged in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, which require people with a certain level of education to serve as accountants, cashiers, recorders, statisticians, propagandists, organizers, etc.; it is even more necessary to have a higher level of education for improving agricultural technology, accepting advanced experience, and summarizing production experience. All of this has been personally experienced by rural cadres. Last year, many higher primary school graduates left in various districts and townships played a certain role in production. Some of them became production experts, labor models, production team leaders, and even directors of production cooperatives in just one year. The peasants reflected that this was the right thing to do, and our village needs such educated people. Indeed, if our agriculture is to implement socialist transformation, these native-born young people with a higher primary school graduation level are a new force. We must attach great importance to them, cultivate them well, and encourage them to actively engage in agricultural production, and work together with adult farmers to jointly complete the great task of socialist transformation of agriculture.

We should see that higher primary school graduates engaging in agricultural labor is not only beneficial to production, but also beneficial to the democratic life of the entire countryside. Now in our villages, the township people's congresses, the township people's governments, and the organizations of the Party and the Communist Youth League often have to discuss national affairs and various affairs of the township, convey and implement the various policies of the People's Government, and deploy various central tasks, all of which require people with cultural knowledge. If more higher primary school graduates stay in the township, they will increase a group of assistants for the township. These young people with a certain level of political and cultural knowledge are easy to accept new ideas and new things. They will gradually become active members in the political life of the countryside and become propagators of the policies of the Party and the People's Government. With them, the work in the countryside will be easier to do. Hasn't the experience of the past year already proven this point? These young people are actively participating in various tasks in the village. They have played a certain role in publicizing the general line, publicizing socialism, in the planned purchase of grain, and in the work of the general election. Many young people have also served as secretaries of the Communist Youth League branch, Party propagandists, and so on.

We should also see that with this group of young people, the cultural life of the countryside will also become more active. The better the production is, the higher the people's requirements for culture will be. This is inevitable. We should think of all possible ways to meet the growing demands of the people for cultural life. And with this group of young people, many tasks can be carried out. Using the strength of higher primary school graduates can make private schools more substantial, consolidate literacy groups, run blackboards better, expand reading groups, strengthen rural political propaganda, and do a better job of promoting health knowledge and marriage law. In addition, singing and small theatrical performances and other entertainment activities can be carried out. In short, these young men will drive the people in the village to make cultural life active. Hasn't the experience of the past year already proven this point?

The summer vacation this year is very close. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out publicity and education work for students and parents in a timely manner, so that this year's higher primary school graduates can happily embark on the production front.

This year's propaganda work should be based on the spirit of the People's Daily editorial on April 19 and the "Instructions on Organizing Higher Primary and Junior High School Graduates Who Cannot Continue Their Education to Participate in or Prepare to Participate in Labor Production" issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League on April 22, combined with the specific conditions of various places, combined with the ideological conditions of students and parents, and using examples of middle and primary school graduates in this district and township engaged in labor production or the experience of other regions, to carry out vivid and lively work with real people and real events.

Propaganda work can take a variety of forms. Based on existing experience, convening a meeting of representatives of higher primary school graduates is a good way. Antong County in Liaodong Province, Yexian County in Shandong Province, and the Dingxian County Committee of the Communist Youth League in Hebei Province have all held meetings of representatives of higher primary school graduates. The general practice is to seize all opportunities for gatherings such as the township holding people's representative meetings and the township people's government holding meetings to deploy work, and the responsible comrades of the local Party organization and the People's Government will conduct publicity. Family visits and individual talks can also be used. In addition, we must actively publicize to mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. Mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives should warmly welcome higher primary school graduates and properly organize them to carry out their work.

In the propaganda, we must focus on criticizing the exploitative class's views of underestimating physical labor, such as "reading books without laboring" and "participating in agricultural production is not glorious and has no future." We must use examples that are easy for the masses to understand to correctly explain the principle that labor is glorious, and explain that physical labor is the basis of mental labor. We must correct the view of some students and parents that not going to school is dropping out of school. We must explain to students and parents the purpose and nature of primary school education. Primary school education is national compulsory education. The people have the right and the obligation to receive national compulsory education. With the development of production, our country will gradually realize the universalization of primary compulsory education. After graduating from primary school, students have completed their compulsory education and should generally go to production posts. It cannot be assumed that not going to school after graduating from primary school is dropping out of school. At the same time, it must also be explained that today the state cannot open more middle schools. First, the money for running schools is used too much, which will affect industrial construction. Second, there are not so many teachers, and so many school buildings cannot be built all at once. These principles must be explained repeatedly and clearly. In the propaganda work, we must also pay close attention to the emotions of students and parents. Young people have their own ideas, and parents have their own ideas. We must patiently and gradually help them to untie the knots in their hearts, prevent impetuous emotions, and never randomly put hats on them and hurt their feelings.

Finally, I would like to talk about the fact that rural cadres must pay attention to cherish and cultivate higher primary school graduates who are engaged in production. In the past few years, especially since last year, a large number of higher primary school graduates have been engaged in agricultural production, and more higher primary school graduates will be engaged in agricultural production in the future. However, it takes a considerable period of education to transform a higher primary school graduate into a new-style farmer. It takes a certain amount of time to stabilize their emotions, and it takes a longer period of production practice for them to master agricultural technology. We have great expectations for this group of young people. We not only require them to train to become production experts now, but also expect them to gradually master new agricultural science and technology and become advanced elements in the countryside in the future and become the backbone of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, rural cadres must pay attention to conducting regular education and assistance to them. The organizations of the Party and the Communist Youth League must always pay attention to conducting political and ideological education to them and continuously improve their socialist consciousness; at the same time, they must also care about their learning after engaging in production, continuously improve their cultural level, solve their after-school learning problems, and urge them to actively learn advanced agricultural technology in conjunction with production practice. In short, we must use a responsible spirit to continuously help, educate, and improve this group of educated youth politically, ideologically, culturally, and technologically, so that they can wholeheartedly work hard to realize the task of socialist transformation of agriculture in our country.

    区、乡干部要重视吸收高小毕业生参加农业生产工作
    柳湜
    我国现在每年有数百万农民子女在高小毕业，这是一件可喜的事。这些青年毕业以后，大都希望升入中学学习。这种愿望是好的。但全国的高小毕业生必然要有许多人不能升入中学。党和人民政府明确指出了：要引导不能升学的农村高小毕业生参加农业生产。去年，全国不少地区在动员和组织高小毕业生从事农业生产方面曾作了很大的努力，也取得了成绩。据不完全的统计，单是东北区就有十四万多名高小毕业生参加了农业生产工作，其中辽西省就有四万九千名，占全省高小毕业生总数的百分之四十五强。山东省大部分高小毕业生都参加了农业生产工作。江苏沭阳县的二千七百五十名高小毕业生，有一千八百三十九名参加了农业生产工作。各地的经验证明了党和人民政府指出的这一条道路，确实是农村高小毕业生的广阔的道路，也证明了高小毕业生从事农业生产对国家建设事业具有重大的意义和作用。但是，去年由于我们对这一件关系人民切身利益的大事事前没有做好宣传和组织工作，没有明确地说明小学教育的性质和目的，没有详细说明农村高小毕业生参加农业生产工作的必要性和重要性，而有些区乡干部对引导高小毕业生从事生产工作的重要性，也认识不足，没有给他们以必要的关怀和鼓励，以致好多地区没有升学的学生曾闹情绪，家长也有意见。今年的暑假不久就要到了。今年全国高小毕业生比以往几年要多得多，其中不能升学的人也会更多，因此，希望全国各地区，特别是具体执行这一任务的区、乡干部，要及早做好准备工作。
    区、乡基层干部应该明确地认识高小毕业生从事农业生产在农业的社会主义改造过程中的意义和作用。我们现在的农村，已经发生了巨大的变化。在逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造的过程中，“干庄稼活”也需要文化。目前我们搞互助组、农业生产合作社，需要有一定文化程度的人来担任会计、出纳、记录、统计、宣传、组织等工作；关于改良农业技术，接受先进经验，总结生产经验，更需要有较高的文化水平的人。这一切，农村干部都是亲自体会到的。去年许多区、乡留下的高小毕业生，都曾在生产上发挥了一定的作用，其中有些在短短的一年中就变成了生产能手、劳动模范、生产队长、互助组长甚至生产合作社主任。农民们反映：这一下搞对了，我们村里就需要这样的读书人。确实是这样，我们的农业要实行社会主义改造，这些土生土长、有高小毕业程度的小伙子，是一支新生的力量。我们要十分看重他们，要好好地培养他们，鼓励他们积极从事农业生产，和成年农民一道，来共同完成农业的社会主义改造的伟大任务。
    我们应该看到，高小毕业生从事农业劳动，不仅对生产有利，同时对整个乡村的民主生活也是有利的。现在我们的乡村里，乡人民代表大会、乡人民政府、党和青年团的组织等，经常要讨论国家大事和本乡的各项事务，要传达和贯彻人民政府的各项政策，要布置各种中心工作，处处需要有文化知识的人。如果本乡高小毕业生留得多些，就为本乡增加了一批助手。这些有一定政治、文化水平的青年人，容易接受新思想和新鲜事物，他们将逐渐成为乡村政治生活中的积极分子，成为党和人民政府的政策的传播者。有了他们，乡村的工作就更好搞了。一年来的经验不是已经证明这点了吗？这些青年人是积极参加村里的各项工作的，他们在宣传总路线、宣传社会主义、在粮食计划收购、普选工作等方面都已起了一定的作用，有许多青年人并且已经担任了青年团支部书记、党的宣传员等等的职务了。
    我们也应该看到，有了这批青年人，乡村文化生活也将更加活跃起来。生产搞得越好，人民对文化的要求也会越高，这是必然的。我们应该想一切可能的办法，来满足不断增长的人民对于文化生活的要求。而有了这批年轻人，许多工作可以搞起来了。运用高小毕业生的力量，可以使民校更充实，使识字组更巩固，把黑板报办得更好，读报组会更加扩大，乡村的政治宣传工作也可以加强，卫生常识和婚姻法宣传等等也都可以搞得更好一些。此外，还可以开展歌咏和小型戏剧等娱乐活动。总之，这些小伙子，会带动村子里的人把文化生活弄得活跃起来。一年来的经验不是也已经证明了这一点吗？
    今年的暑假已很迫近。因此，必须及时地开展对学生、家长的宣传和教育工作，使今年高小毕业生愉快地走上生产战线。
    今年的宣传工作，要根据人民日报四月十九日的社论和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会四月二十二日发布的“关于组织不能升学的高小和初中毕业生参加或准备参加劳动生产的指示”的精神，结合各地具体情况，结合学生和家长的思想情况，并利用本区和本乡中、小学毕业生从事劳动生产的范例或其他地区的经验，用真人真事，生动活泼地来进行。
    宣传工作可以采取多种多样的方式。根据已有的经验，召开高小毕业生代表会议是一种很好的办法，辽东省安东县，山东省掖县，青年团河北省定县委员会都举行过高小毕业生代表会议。一般的作法是抓紧乡里召开人民代表会议、乡人民政府开会布置工作等一切集会的机会，由当地党组织和人民政府的负责同志进行宣传。还可采用家庭访问，个别谈话等方式。此外，我们还要积极向互助组和农业生产合作社进行宣传。互助组和农业生产合作社应当热烈欢迎高小毕业生，妥善地组织他们进行工作。
    在宣传中，要着重批评“读了书就不劳动”，“参加农业生产不光彩，没出息”等等轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级的观点，要用群众易懂的例子正确阐明劳动光荣的道理，要说明体力劳动是脑力劳动的基础。要纠正一部分学生和家长认为不升学就是失学的看法。要向学生和家长讲清楚小学教育的目的和性质。小学教育是国民义务教育，人民有权利，也有义务受国民义务教育。随着生产的发展，我国将逐步实现普及初级义务教育。学生在小学毕业后，便已受完了义务教育，一般都应走上生产岗位。不能认为，小学毕业后不升学就是失学。同时也要说明，今天国家还不可能开办更多的中学，一是办学的钱用得太多，会影响工业建设，一是没有那么多教师，一下子也盖不起那么多校舍。这些道理，要反复交代清楚。在宣传工作中，还要密切注意学生和家长的情绪，年轻人有年轻人的想法，家长有家长的想法，我们要循循善诱地一层一层地替他们解去心中的结，要防止急躁情绪，更不可随便乱戴帽子，伤害感情。
    最后我要谈一下，农村干部必需注意爱护和培养从事生产的高小毕业生。过去几年，特别是从去年起，已有大批的高小毕业生从事农业生产，今后将有更多的高小毕业生从事农业生产。但是，从一个高小毕业生变成一个新式农民，是要经过一个相当时期的教育过程的。安定他们的情绪就需要一定时间，他们要掌握农业技术，更须要有较长时期的生产实践。我们对这批年轻人是寄以很大期望的，我们不仅要求他们现在锻炼成为生产能手，还期望他们逐步掌握新的农业科学技术，成为今后农村的先进分子，成为农业互助合作运动中的骨干。因此，农村干部必须注意对他们进行经常的教育和帮助。党和青年团的组织要经常注意对他们进行政治思想教育，不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟；同时也要关心他们从事生产以后的学习，不断提高他们的文化水平，解决他们的业余学习问题，督促他们结合生产实践积极学习先进农业技术。总之，要以认真负责的精神，从政治上、思想上、文化上和技术上来不断帮助、教育和提高这批知识青年，使他们全心全意地为实现祖国的农业的社会主义改造的任务而努力。
