Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch: Production collaboration among mechanical factories in Southwest China has seen further development this year. Chongqing Air Compressor Factory is currently producing cast steel parts for various machines for units such as Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory and Chongqing Universal Machinery Factory. Chongqing Machine Tool Factory is manufacturing gears for Chongqing Air Compressor Factory and others. These collaborative relationships have been solidified through ordering contracts.

To complete current production tasks, various mechanical factories have also been providing mutual support. Since the beginning of this year, at the monthly production meetings held by the Southwest Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, factories have jointly studied matters such as supporting workers, machines, and commissioned processing. This type of processing is often limited to a specific process or a specific part. For example, if Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory cannot grind peach shafts, Chongqing Machine Tool Factory will grind them instead; if Chongqing Machine Tool Factory does not have an annealing furnace, Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory will help with annealing. In March, when Chongqing Universal Machinery Factory was repairing its foundry, Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory temporarily made the castings needed by this factory during the repair period.

Production collaboration between state-owned and private mechanical factories has also begun. For example, the state-owned Chongqing Air Compressor Factory not only solves the problem of cast steel parts for state-owned factories, but also for private factories. The private Chongqing Cooperative Hardware Machinery Manufacturing Factory relies on state-owned factories to manufacture a precision part on a spinning machine that it cannot produce itself.

Production collaboration has particularly important significance in mechanical factories in Southwest China. The mechanical factories in Southwest China have all grown out of factories with a repair and assembly nature, and are now beginning to produce complete sets of machines. Producing such machines requires the production of thousands of machine parts and going through many processes. If even one part cannot be produced or one process cannot be processed, a complete machine cannot be produced. Therefore, factories must cooperate and collaborate with each other. During the period of the first Five-Year Plan, mechanical factories in Southwest China, on the one hand, undertook the task of trial-manufacturing more complete sets of new machines to support national construction, and on the other hand, had to manufacture various equipment and accessories urgently needed for local production and construction. In order to complete such complex tasks, the Southwest Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government is planning to further strengthen production collaboration between factories.

    通过订货合同形式推进生产协作关系
    西南区各机械工厂开始生产成套的机器
    【新华社重庆电】西南各机械工厂的生产协作今年有了进一步的发展。重庆空气压缩机厂正为贵阳矿山机器厂、重庆通用机器厂等单位生产各种机械上的浇钢零件。重庆机床厂为重庆空气压缩机厂等制造齿轮。这些协作关系都已通过订货合同的形式固定下来。
    各机械厂为完成当前的生产任务，还进行了互相支援。今年以来，中央人民政府第一机械工业部西南办事处每月召开的生产会议上，各厂都彼此研究支援工人、机器和委托加工等事项。这种加工往往只限于某一道工序或某一种零件。如重庆柴油机厂不能磨桃子轴，便由重庆机床厂代磨；重庆机床厂没有退火炉，便由重庆柴油机厂帮着退火。三月份重庆通用机器厂修理翻砂间，修理期间这个工厂需要的铸件便由重庆柴油机厂代做。
    国营和私营机械工厂间的生产协作也已开始。如国营重庆空气压缩机厂不仅为国营厂，也为私营厂解决浇钢零件问题。私营重庆合作五金机器制造厂自己不能制造的一种纺纱机上的精密零件，就依靠国营厂代为制造。
    生产协作在西南各机械工厂有特别重要的意义。西南各机械工厂都是在修配性质的工厂基础上成长起来的，现在才开始生产成套的机器。生产这样的机器要生产千百个机器零件，要经过许多道工序，只要其中有一个零件不能生产，有一道工序不能加工，便生产不出一部完整的机器来。因此各工厂必须相互配合，相互协作。在国家第一个五年计划时期中，西南各机械工厂一方面承担了试制更多成套新式机器支援全国建设的任务，另一方面又必须承制各种为当地生产、建设迫切需要的设备和配件。为了完成这样复杂的任务，中央人民政府第一机械工业部西南办事处正在筹划进一步加强各厂间生产协作的办法。
