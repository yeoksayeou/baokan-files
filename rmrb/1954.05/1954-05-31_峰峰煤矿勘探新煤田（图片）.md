Peak Mine Explores New Coalfield
    In order to meet the needs of national construction, the Peak Coal Mine has conducted geological exploration at several new locations to find coal seams. Exploration results have revealed two new coalfield areas containing rich high-grade coking coal. After construction and mining in the future, it will powerfully supply the needs of steelmaking. This is a scene of geological personnel surveying and mapping. Xinhua News Agency draft, photo by He Shutian
    Local farmers actively assist geological personnel in exploring coal seams. This is a farmer digging a well in a new coalfield area, taking reference coal samples from the well to help geological personnel understand the underground coal deposits.

    峰峰煤矿勘探新煤田
    为适应祖国建设的需要，峰峰煤矿在几个新地点进行了寻找煤层的地质测探工作，经勘探结果发现两个新的煤田区蕴藏着丰富的高级炼焦煤，将来建井开采后，将有力地供应炼钢的需用。这是地质人员在测绘的情形。新华社稿　何书田摄
    当地农民积极协助地质人员勘探煤层。这是农民在一个新煤田区挖井，从井下采上参考煤样，帮助地质人员了解地下煤藏的情况。
