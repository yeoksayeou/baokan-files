    Shenyang Municipal Finance and Economics Committee
    Discusses Non-Staple Food Supply Work
    At the end of April, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee held a meeting specifically to discuss the supply of non-staple foods. The meeting first reviewed the past supply of non-staple foods: although meat, vegetables, aquatic products, etc., increased by 36.2% in 1953 compared with 1951, the supply of non-staple foods still fell short of demand due to the continuous increase in population and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. After detailed discussions, the problems and difficulties existing in the production and supply of non-staple foods were identified: the contradiction between decentralized production and centralized management; the contradiction between seasonal production and year-round supply; backward production technology failing to keep up with the growing needs of consumption; and the lack of a unified leading body for the long-term storage and long-distance transportation of non-staple foods.
    In light of the above, the meeting decided to establish a specialized management agency for non-staple food supply and clarified the division of labor between state-owned commerce and cooperatives in terms of business. In addition, the meeting believed that it is necessary to strengthen the planning of non-staple food production and supply, overcome the phenomenon of out-of-stock and overstocking, and further implement zonal supply and various contract systems in order to gradually resolve the above contradictions. Specific measures to increase production were also proposed. This year, in addition to planning to drill a large number of wells, 10,000 square meters of greenhouses and 500 hotbeds will be built. Regarding pig breeding, in addition to increasing the number of pigs, superior breeds will also be bred in large numbers, striving to turn all the pigs in the suburbs into Berkshire and Yorkshire breeds by 1957. In addition, a state-owned vegetable farm and a feed processing plant will be built. (Our Northeast Reporter Station)

    沈阳市财政经济委员会
    讨论副食品供应工作
    沈阳市人民政府财政经济委员会于四月底开会专门讨论副食品的供应问题。会议首先检查了过去副食品的供应情况：肉类、蔬菜、水产等，一九五三年虽较一九五一年增加了百分之三十六点二，但由于人口不断增加，人民生活水平不断上升，副食品仍然供不应求。经详细讨论后，摸清了副食品生产和供应工作上存在着的问题和困难是：分散生产和集中经营的矛盾；生产季节性和常年供应相矛盾；生产技术落后赶不上消费增长的需要；对副食品的长期保管和长途运输缺乏统一的领导机构。
    根据上述情况，会议决定建立副食品供应的专管机构，明确了国营商业和合作社业务上的分工。此外，会议认为必须加强副食品生产与供应的计划性，克服脱销与积压现象，进一步贯彻分区供应和各种合同制，以便逐渐解决上述矛盾。并提出增加产量的具体措施，今年除计划大量打井外，将修建一万平方公尺的温室和五百个温床。关于猪的饲养，除增加头数外，并大量繁殖优良猪种，争取在一九五七年，把全郊区的猪都变成巴克夏和约克夏猪种。此外并筹建一个国营蔬菜农场，和一个饲料加工厂。　　　（本报东北记者站）
