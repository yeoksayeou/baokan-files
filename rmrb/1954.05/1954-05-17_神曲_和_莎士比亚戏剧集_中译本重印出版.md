"The Divine Comedy" and "The Complete Works of Shakespeare"
Chinese Translations Reprinted and Published

    The Writer's Publishing House has recently reprinted Wang Weike's translation of "The Divine Comedy" and Zhu Shenghao's translation of "The Complete Works of Shakespeare," with some revisions.

    Dante was a great Italian poet of the early fourteenth century. His "Divine Comedy" includes three parts: "Inferno," "Purgatory," and "Paradise." The poet made passionate and sharp satirical comments on the politics, society, and church of the time, and comprehensively reviewed the highest achievements of Western European medieval philosophy and art. Therefore, this work became a precursor to the Renaissance and also the overture to modern literature. The currently reprinted translation is a prose translation by the translator based on the original Italian text.

    Shakespeare is the world's greatest playwright and a great representative of the English Renaissance. His thirty-seven brilliant plays are a valuable literary heritage for all mankind. There have been many scattered translations in China before, and Zhu Shenghao's translation is the most extensive, with a total of thirty-one plays, most of which were published in 1947, but they were not given much attention. Now, the Writer's Publishing House has made some revisions and reprinted them in twelve volumes, of which three volumes have been published: the first volume includes "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "The Merchant of Venice," and "Much Ado About Nothing"; the second volume includes "As You Like It," "Twelfth Night," and "All's Well That Ends Well"; and the third volume includes "Measure for Measure," "The Tempest," and "The Winter's Tale." The other nine volumes will also be published successively around June.

    “神曲”和“莎士比亚戏剧集”
    中译本重印出版
    作家出版社最近已将王维克译的“神曲”和朱生豪译的“莎士比亚戏剧集”作了若干修订，重印出版。
    但丁是十四世纪初意大利的大诗人，他的“神曲”包括“地狱”、“净界”、“天堂”三部。诗人对当时的政治、社会和教会作了热情而尖锐的讽刺，综合地评述了西欧中世纪哲学和艺术的最高成就，因此这部作品成为文艺复兴的前驱，同时也是近代文学的序曲。现在重印出版的译本是译者根据意大利文原文用散文译出的。
    莎士比亚是世界最伟大的戏剧作家，英国文艺复兴的伟大代表者。他的三十七种光辉灿烂的剧作是全人类的宝贵文学遗产。我国早就有过不少零星的译本，而以朱生豪译的为最多，共三十一种，其中大部分已于一九四七年出版过，但未为人所重视。现在作家出版社作了若干修订重印出版，分订十二册，已出版三册：第一册包括“仲夏夜之梦”、“威尼斯商人”、“无事烦恼”；第二册包括“皆大欢喜”、“第十二夜”、“终成眷属”；第三册包括“量罪记”、“暴风雨”、“冬天的故事”。其它九册亦将于六月前后陆续出版。
