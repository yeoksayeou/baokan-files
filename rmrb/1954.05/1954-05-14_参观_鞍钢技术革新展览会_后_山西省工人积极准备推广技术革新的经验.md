After visiting the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition," the members of the Shanxi Province delegation were greatly inspired and encouraged by this study. Many people felt that this visit was even more rewarding than the training class in the first half of the year. Everyone felt that almost every creation and improvement at Anshan Iron and Steel was the result of close collaboration between workers and engineering technicians, giving full play to the spirit of collective creation, and hard work under the guidance of Soviet experts. Many workers and engineering technicians have examined themselves in light of the advanced thinking and deeds of Anshan Iron and Steel's model workers. Cheng Genxiong, the electrical team leader of the coking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, learned from the arduous process of Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "anti-encircling disk" and Wang Chonglun's creation of the "universal tool tire" the reasons why some of his past creations failed, mainly because of working alone and lacking the spirit of painstaking research and overcoming difficulties. Cheng Genxiong said that after the meeting, he would definitely work with technicians to continue to study the "coal-iron separator" to solve the frequent accidents of the coal washing machine. Wang Kaishan, a 61-year-old technician at the Taiyuan Second Power Plant, plans to promote Anshan Iron and Steel's advanced experiences such as the "grinding machine" and "automatic water tank alarm," and continue to study and improve the "anti-ash and sand chimney cover," "tube washing machine swivel," "tube expander," and so on.

The representatives are actively preparing to promote Anshan Iron and Steel's experience in technological innovation. According to preliminary statistics, the representatives of each unit plan to promote 75 kinds of innovations, including the "universal tool tire," "scribing table," and "motor high temperature automatic stop." In addition, there are 11 kinds that can be improved and promoted in light of the specific conditions of their own units.

All the members of the delegation unanimously stated that they must convey the outstanding achievements and experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's technological innovation to the broad masses of workers and staff, extensively carry out the technological innovation movement, improve labor productivity, and overfulfill the state plan.

    参观“鞍钢技术革新展览会”后
    山西省工人积极准备推广技术革新的经验
    参观“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的山西省代表团人员，在这次学习中得到很大的启示和鼓舞，许多人认为这次参观比上半年训练班的收获还要大。大家都感到鞍钢的每一件创造和改进，几乎无一不是工人和工程技术人员紧密结合，发挥集体创造精神，在苏联专家帮助下，艰苦奋斗的结果。许多工人和工程技术人员都结合鞍钢劳动模范的先进思想和先进事迹，检查了自己。太原钢铁厂炼焦部电气组长成根雄，从张明山创造“反围盘”、王崇伦创造“万能工具胎”的艰苦过程中，找到了他过去有些创造不能成功的原因，主要是因为单干并缺乏苦心钻研和克服困难的精神。成根雄表示，会后一定要和技术人员结合，继续研究“煤铁分离器”，以解决洗煤机经常出事故的问题。太原第二发电厂六十一岁的技师王凯山，计划推广鞍钢的“研磨机”、“水箱自动警报器”等先进经验，并继续研究改进“防灰沙烟囱罩”、“洗管器甩头”、“涨管器”等等。
    代表们正积极准备推广鞍钢技术革新的经验。据初步统计：各单位代表计划推广的有“万能工具胎”、“划线台”、“马达高温自动停止器”等七十五种。另外还有十一种可以结合本单位具体情况加以改进推广。
    代表团全体人员一致表示，一定要把鞍钢技术革新的卓越的成就和经验，向广大职工群众传达，广泛开展技术革新运动，提高劳动生产率，超额完成国家计划。
