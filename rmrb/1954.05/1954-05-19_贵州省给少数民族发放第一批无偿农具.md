Guizhou Province has begun distributing its first batch of free agricultural tools for this year in twenty-eight counties where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities or are scattered, including Liping, Rongjiang, Libo, Luodian, Wangmo, Huishui, and Dading. Most counties started distributing the free agricultural tools earlier than last year. By the end of April, three districts in Dading County had completed the distribution, and six districts had almost finished; the county expects to distribute all of the first batch of more than 6,000 free agricultural tools by mid-May. The seventh district of Bijie County solicited opinions from ethnic minority representatives in advance, ensuring that the quality of the agricultural tools was high and the design was suitable.

After the Central People's Government allocated special funds for free agricultural tools at the beginning of this year, the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee seriously studied how to improve the distribution work and better support the development of production among ethnic minorities. Starting in February, the Provincial People's Government's Financial and Economic Committee allocated the first batch of 2 billion yuan in special funds to various counties. Subsequently, the Party committees and people's governments of the aforementioned counties established relevant organizations to specifically lead the production and distribution of agricultural tools.

Because distributing free agricultural tools is a major measure by the Party and the People's Government to increase the productivity of ethnic minorities, gradually change their backward production conditions, and improve their lives, all localities first publicized the Party's guidelines and policies, strengthened investigation and research work, and entrusted state-owned ethnic trade stores and supply and marketing cooperatives to undertake the task of producing free agricultural tools by convening ethnic minority representative meetings or other methods during the distribution process. After accepting the task of producing the tools, the Liping County State-owned Ethnic Trade Store and the County Cooperative Union not only actively organized processing within the county but also sent people to Jinping County and Hongjiang City in Hunan Province to purchase them.

    贵州省给少数民族发放第一批无偿农具
    贵州省今年第一批无偿农具的发放工作，已在少数民族聚居或散居的黎平、榕江、荔波、罗甸、望谟、惠水、大定等二十八个县内相继展开。今年的无偿农具发放工作，多数县都比去年提早。四月底，大定县有三个区已发放完毕，六个区基本结束；全县在五月中旬前，第一批六千多件无偿农具都可发下去。毕节县第七区由于事先征求了少数民族代表的意见，农具的质量既高，式样也合。
    今年年初，中央人民政府拨下无偿农具专款后，中共贵州省委认真的研究了怎样把发放工作作好，更好地扶持少数民族发展生产；二月份起，省人民政府财政经济委员会就把第一批专款二十亿元拨发各县。接着，上述各县的党委和人民政府，就相继成立了有关组织，具体领导农具的打制和发放工作。
    由于发放无偿农具，是党和人民政府提高少数民族人民的生产力，逐步改变其落后的生产面貌，并改善其生活的重大措施，各地在进行发放工作时，首先通过召开少数民族代表会或其他方法，宣传了党的方针政策，加强了调查研究工作，并委托各地国营民族贸易商店和供销合作社，担负起代制无偿农具的任务。黎平县国营民族贸易商店和县联社接受代制任务后，除积极在本县组织加工外，并派人到锦屏县和湖南省的洪江市进行采购。
