Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 29th: Highway construction in the Northwest Region has fully commenced this year, with construction workers engaged in arduous struggles to overcome natural difficulties.

Workers constructing the Qinghai-Tibet Highway are excavating marshy and wet land on the Bayan Har Mountain summit, which stands at an altitude of over 4,000 meters. This year, the focus of construction on the highway from Lanzhou, Gansu, to Aba, Sichuan, will be on bridges such as the Suosoma Bridge, Shuangcheng Bridge, and Toudao River Bridge. Workers building the Toudao River Bridge, braving the cold, jumped into the rapid Da Xia River to dig sand and drive bridge piles, completing the foundation work of the bridge before the flood season. Reinforcement work on the Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge began as early as April, and the reinforcement of the first span and installation of new steel frames have now been completed. In addition, the new line from Kashgar to Torugart in Xinjiang also began construction in early May; the concrete pouring for the Xianyang Wei River Bridge on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway has been completed, with 75 percent of the entire project finished.

In order to accelerate the eastward transportation of crude oil from the Yumen Oilfield and to cooperate with the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Northwest transportation departments have also conducted road condition inspections on the Lanzhou-Xingxingxia Road and the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road. Some bridges along the Daichaigou to Yumen section of the Lanzhou-Xingxingxia Road have been identified for reinforcement; the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road will also undergo necessary roadbed widening and culvert dredging to prevent traffic disruptions during the rainy season.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Shelterbelts are being created along railway lines in the Northwest Region. By the end of last year, 1.8 million poplar, elm, and black locust trees had been planted along the western section of the Longhai Railway. This year, a large number of weeping willows have been transplanted in water-scarce and brackish water areas along the line, and more than 100,000 saplings have been replanted in sparsely wooded sections. On the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, 120 kilometers of shelterbelts have been planted between Lanzhou and Zhongbao. In the future, ailanthus trees, which have significant economic value, will be planted to provide sleeper materials locally.

This year, a comprehensive survey of suitable afforestation areas has been conducted along the western section of the Longhai Railway, and a plan for creating shelterbelts has been formulated. Preliminary design work for afforestation along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has also been completed, and preparations are underway to establish nurseries and mobilize the masses of farmers along the line to maintain the trees.

    西北区今年公路建设全面开始
    陇海铁路西段和兰新铁路沿线营造绿化林带
    据新华社西安二十九日电：西北区今年的公路建设已经全面开始，筑路职工正在为克服自然困难而进行着艰苦的斗争。
    修筑青藏公路的工人，在拔海四千多公尺的巴颜喀喇山顶上，开挖着沮洳地和潮湿地。由甘肃兰州到四川阿坝的公路线，今年要重点修建洒索马桥、双城桥和头道河桥等桥梁。修筑头道河桥的工人在天气还冷的时候，就光着腿跳进湍急的大夏河中去挖掘泥沙和打桥桩，赶在汛期以前完成了这座桥梁的基础工程。兰州黄河铁桥的加固工程早在四月间就开始了，现在已完成了第一孔桥的加固和新钢架的安装工作。此外，新疆喀什到吐尔尕特新线也已在五月初开工；西（安）兰（州）公路上咸阳渭河大桥的灌注混凝土工程已经完毕，全部工程已累计完成百分之七十五。
    为了加速玉门油矿原油的东运和配合宝成铁路的修建，西北交通部门并对兰（州）猩（猩猩峡）路和川陕路进行了路况检查。兰猩路打柴沟到玉门段沿线的一些桥梁已确定要加固；川陕路也要进行必要的路基加宽和桥涵疏浚工作，以防止雨季阻碍通车。
    据新华社兰州讯：西北铁路沿线正在营造绿化林带。陇海铁路西段到去年止曾种植了一百八十万株杨树、榆树和洋槐，今年沿线缺水和苦水地区又移植了大批旱柳，树木稀疏地段补植了十多万株树苗。兰新铁路方面兰州到中堡间也种植了一百二十公里的林椽木，今后还将增植经济价值很大的椿树，以便将来就地取用枕木材料。
    陇海铁路西段今年已经全面进行了宜林地带的调查工作，订出了营造绿化林带的计划。兰新铁路沿线也已初步做好绿化工作的定型设计，正准备建立苗圃，并发动沿线农民群众维护树木。
