    The basic-level election work in Shaanxi Province has been completely concluded. All 6,412 basic-level units in the province have convened their first People's Congresses to discuss current work.

    During the basic-level elections in Shaanxi Province, the voter turnout generally reached about 90% of the total number of voters. In mountainous areas such as Yanchuan, Feng County, Zhashui, and Baihe, the voter turnout reached over 94% of the total number of voters. Many elderly people who rarely leave their homes personally participated in the election meetings this time. In Baixiang Township, Nanzheng County, a 145-year-old woman named Grandma Liao personally participated in the election meeting like the young people. She carefully cast her vote when electing representatives and said: "The representatives elected today are all people who can do things for us."

    During the basic-level elections, many outstanding individuals were elected as people's representatives. Among the more than 18,000 people's representatives elected in ten counties in Shaanxi Province, including Dali, Tongguan, Yongshou, and Luonan, more than 6,000 are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. In the old revolutionary base areas of northern Shaanxi, a large number of veteran cadres were transferred to work throughout the country in the past. Now, a new batch of young and outstanding cadres is continuing to grow here. According to statistics from 29 townships in Yan'an County, among the 464 people's representatives elected this time, 245 are local young cadres. Most of these people are children of revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, and family members of staff members. They have shown infinite loyalty in inheriting the revolutionary cause of their fathers and brothers, and therefore have won the support of the broad masses of the people.

    Currently, the people's representatives in various places are leading the broad masses of the people to actively implement the resolutions of the People's Congress. The people's representatives of various townships in the Fifth District of Tongguan County are separately leading the farmers throughout the district in studying relevant policies on mutual aid and cooperation, focusing on consolidating mutual aid teams, and organizing 154 mutual aid teams to carry out a spring production competition, rapidly completing the hoeing of wheat, transporting manure, and repairing ditches in the Fifth District. More than 1,400 township people's representatives in Xixiang County have led farmers to build more than 1,500 canals and 165 weirs and ponds. After the basic-level elections, eight counties including Mizhi, Chunhua, Zichang, LinYou, and Ansai have also consolidated and developed many mutual aid and cooperative organizations under the leadership of the people's representatives in various townships.

    陕西省基层选举工作全部结束
    陕西省基层选举工作已全部结束。全省六千四百一十二个基层单位都召开了第一次人民代表大会，讨论了当前的工作。
    陕西省在基层选举中，参加选举的选民一般都达到选民总数的百分之九十左右。在延川、凤县、柞水、白河等山区，参加选举的选民达到选民总数的百分之九十四以上。许多经常不出门的老人这次都亲自参加了选举大会。南郑县柏乡有一个一百四十五岁的廖老婆婆，也和年轻人一样亲自参加了选举大会。在选举代表时，她认真地投了票，并说：今天选的代表都是能给咱们办事的人。
    在基层选举中，许多优秀人物被选为人民代表。陕西省大荔、潼关、永寿、雒南等十个县选出的一万八千多名人民代表中，有六千多名是共产党员和青年团员。在陕北革命老根据地，过去曾有大批老干部调出到全国各地工作，现在，这里又继续成长起一批年青的优秀干部。据延安县二十九个乡的统计，这次选出的四百六十四个人民代表中，有二百四十五人是本地的青年干部。这些人多半是革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和工作人员家属的子弟。他们在继承父、兄的革命事业中表现了无限的忠诚，因而获得广大人民的拥护。
    现在，各地的人民代表正领导广大人民积极贯彻人民代表大会的决议。潼关县第五区各乡的人民代表分别领导全区农民学习有关互助合作政策，并重点整顿互助组，组织了一百五十四个互助组开展春季生产竞赛，迅速地完成了第五区的锄麦、送粪和修渠工作。西乡县一千四百多名乡人民代表已领导农民兴修渠道一千五百多条和堰塘一百六十五处。米脂、淳化、子长、麟游、安塞等八县经过基层选举后，在各乡人民代表带动下，也整顿和发展了许多互助合作组织。　　　（新华社）
