Fudan University's Scientific Research Work
Su Buqing, Dean of Studies, Fudan University

Since studying the resolutions of the National Comprehensive University Conference last year, the teachers of Fudan University have further recognized the importance and broad scope of conducting scientific research work, and their enthusiasm for conducting scientific research has greatly increased. In the past semester, some new sprouts have appeared in scientific research work, with 90 topics being researched by teachers across the university and six specialized lecture series being offered. Scientific research work has begun to play a role in leveraging the enthusiasm of teachers and improving the quality of teaching and scientific standards.

In this short semester, although our scientific research work has had a beginning, if we are to be like the Soviet Union and regard scientific research work as the creative labor of teachers, then the research work in our universities at present is still minimal. Even most of the work, such as compiling teaching materials, translating Soviet scientific works, and offering lectures, cannot be regarded as scientific research. Of course, this cannot be demanded of comprehensive universities in China at present. First, the higher education institutions inherited from old China, before the reorganization of departments and faculties, had complex and disproportionate structures. In particular, everyone's understanding of scientific research was very inconsistent. The achievements of the past few scientific workers were not valued, let alone encouraged and commended, so the foundation for carrying out scientific research was very poor. Second, during the ideological remolding of teachers in individual schools, it was proposed that the motivation for past scientific research work came entirely from the pursuit of fame and position, and that guiding young people in research was said to be the main reason for making them transcend politics and class. These specious criticisms also affected the development of scientific research work. Third, after the reorganization of departments and faculties, teachers generally participate in collective teaching. Because everyone still lacks experience in collective teaching, the unity among teachers needs to be strengthened. The teaching hours of teachers have increased compared to the past, so there is inevitably a view of "teaching first, research later." Fourth, there are also some teachers who have not started teaching, although they have plenty of time, but they have views such as "old knowledge is no longer needed, and new knowledge has not been learned well." All of these have hindered the development of scientific research to some extent. Based on the above-mentioned actual situation, the scientific research work of our university is starting under lower requirements. Although we have gained some preliminary experience in the past semester, our experience is still limited. Therefore, here, I would like to put forward some preliminary experiences, together with an analysis of the ideological situation, as well as my personal opinions on the direction of future efforts, for your reference.

First, last year's National Comprehensive University Conference called on us to combine teaching with scientific research and include the compilation of good teaching materials in the scope of research, which pointed out a method for us to conduct research. But this does not mean that compiling teaching materials already meets the standards of scientific research, let alone that this is the entirety of scientific research work. Compiling teaching materials is to introduce existing materials, appropriately adding, supplementing, and deleting to make them suitable for the needs of current teaching. This is to prepare for classes and cannot be called research work. Of course, scientific researchers can write their important achievements on individual issues into teaching materials when compiling them, but this is only an introduction to the results obtained and cannot be regarded as research work. Scientific research is to explore unknown truths, develop and solve new academic problems, and improve the existing academic level, so it cannot be confused with the compilation of teaching materials. So why should research be combined with teaching? I think the reason is that comprehensive universities are mainly teaching institutions, and teaching and research work are mutually beneficial and mutually improving. Therefore, its research work cannot but be different from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, especially at present, when our teaching work still needs to be vigorously reformed, and conditions must be further created for scientific research. We often feel that the teaching level is too low to talk about any research. Precisely because of this, we must vigorously carry out research to enrich teaching content and improve teaching quality, thereby promoting research work. For example, compiling and translating Soviet university teaching materials and recent literature to enrich teaching content; or removing the toxic parts from bourgeois culture and absorbing the useful parts to make it serve teaching; these should all be regarded as the preparatory stage for carrying out research. In a word, to have scientific research, it must be based on the good foundation of combining teaching and doing a good job in teaching, so that research can be gradually carried out. In today's Fudan University, the professional level of teachers varies greatly, and the material conditions of each unit are also good or bad. The amount and scope of scientific research determined by these two aspects can also be very different. Despite the objective facts, in today's extremely heavy teaching work, we must clearly recognize the close relationship between teaching and research in order to eliminate the incorrect view of some teachers that there is a contradiction between the two in terms of time allocation. In fact, places where teaching is done well are definitely able to carry out research work earlier; conversely, teachers who often use being busy as an excuse and are unwilling to conduct research generally cannot do a good job in teaching either. It must be pointed out here that individual old professors have too many classes or heavy administrative work and do not have enough time to engage in research. Young teaching assistants have too much teaching work and cannot find time to receive guidance from old teachers, or they work hard, which affects their health. There are also some teaching assistants who are eager to research and participate in several lectures at the same time, spending a lot of time but with little effect. These problems must be paid attention to and gradually resolved.

Second, as everyone knows, scientific research must be linked to practice. The greatest feature of Soviet science is that it can solve practical problems. Because the Soviet Union is building a communist society, the work in industry, agriculture, economy, and culture is greatly developed on an improved scientific basis, and the new problems encountered are becoming increasingly profound, making science present a rapidly changing situation. In the Soviet Union, the requirements for scientific research work are very strict. Teachers who do not conduct scientific research work cannot be called teachers of higher education institutions. We cannot demand this now, but it is necessary to strive to create conditions. What is our reality? Because we currently need to train a large number of construction cadres and scientific research talents, combining teaching can be said to be combining the reality of national construction, so teaching is the reality we must link with. Not only that, but for the urgent needs of national defense, industry, agriculture, economy, culture and other constructions, China's science and technology circles, medical circles, forestry circles and financial and economic departments are all working all the time. Can we university teachers be indifferent to this development? Of course, we must care about these developments to carry out our work. However, we should not and cannot mechanically view the issue of linking with practice, causing the already small amount of scientific research work to stop because of this. On the contrary, we should link as much as we can, strive for conditions, seize opportunities, not dislike the problems being too small, nor be afraid of the problems being too difficult, be realistic, do things steadily and surely. This can not only solve the current needs, but also use this to "exercise our skills" in advance and build "fortifications" to prepare for the large number of practical work that is about to come. For example, some teachers in our physics department continue to carry out the research on X-ray tubes that they have not yet succeeded in the past, and have achieved preliminary results, and cooperate with relevant departments to solve part of the problems for the country. The chemistry department is planning to study minerals and has already contacted relevant departments. The other party provides materials, and we report the research results to the other party. Professors from the biology department constantly go to South China with personnel from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to study plants. Although these research works are still in the initial stage and the results are not yet great, its direction is correct. On the other hand, the mathematics department has opened special reports on "Function Theory," "Differential Equations," and "Differential Geometry," and the department of foreign languages and literature has set up lectures on "English Poetry Research" and "History of English Literature"; one aspect is to train teachers, and the other is to cultivate a "research atmosphere" in Fudan University, striving for all teachers to be willing to conduct scientific research work in the future, and all feel that scientific research work is an organic part of his life. These practices are undoubtedly correct. However, these works are still relatively preliminary, and some people may doubt whether such content is too far from the actual construction of the country. But despite this, they still have valuable value in the long-term course of the entire scientific development; and without them, scientific research will become a state of emptiness without a starting point. It will be too late to start thinking of solutions by the time of the second five-year plan.

Third, in the work of the past year or so, I have deeply realized that in order to enable scientific research work to be carried out smoothly and achieve certain results, the unity among teachers must be strengthened. This includes the unity between new and old teachers, the unity between old teachers, and even the unity between new teachers. Among the old teachers, there are also those who have been sticking to research positions for decades and have achieved considerable achievements. When they guide research, they often feel that the foundation of young teachers is too poor, and they are not confident about the prospects of training. Some teachers hold an attitude of disdain for research work. They are generally unrealistic and have not properly guided new teachers. There are also some old teachers who have a strong sense of inferiority and cannot hold their heads up in front of new teachers. Individual old teachers feel particularly energetic towards young teachers who have always been guided by themselves, and have a feeling of "incorrigibility" towards "non-direct descendants." Conversely, individual young teachers look down on old teachers and are unwilling to humbly ask them for advice. Between old teachers, especially between old teachers in the same industry, after ideological remolding, the previous "sectarian views" and the idea of "scholars despising each other" have been basically defeated, but it cannot be denied that these ideas still remain more or less and bring many obstacles to the development of scientific research. For example, when the reorganization of departments and faculties was just completed, teachers from various schools were alienated from each other, and everyone kept their "ambitions" for research a secret. Among young teachers, there is still a consciousness of comparing academic knowledge. These phenomena of disunity have been basically corrected under the correct leadership of the school's party organization and administration. It is also on the basis of this victory that we can initially carry out scientific research work. In order to further improve this work and make scientific research serve the country's socialist construction, we must learn from the spirit of Soviet scientists of cooperating with each other, helping each other, and working together; continue to promote the atmosphere of unity between new and old teachers, old teachers helping new teachers, young teachers learning from old teachers, and students respecting teachers. At present, we must first put forward everyone's research plan under the leadership of the teaching and research group and put forward opinions to each other with a sincere and earnest attitude, learn from each other's strengths, make up for our own weaknesses, and appropriately unfold criticism and self-criticism.

Fourth, I would like to put forward the following points of view on our scientific research work in the future: First, the requirements for scientific research work must be appropriately increased. Because everyone emphasized teaching in the past semester, the requirements for research were set very low, the purpose of which was to encourage everyone to embark on the road of research; however, we must never stay in the same place for a lifetime, but must raise our requirements for ourselves in our work. Second, we must achieve "making the best use of people and things." As everyone knows, scientific research is an arduous task, with many failures and slow results. We have no reason to see it as an easy task. If there is no enthusiastic guidance from old teachers and no humble acceptance from new teachers, then it is impossible to do a good job in research work. At the same time, departments and faculties with equipment must make full use of this equipment to maximize its effectiveness; units with poor equipment must rely on the creativity of researchers, so that work can still be carried out in the case of lack of manpower and material resources. Our teachers must accurately allocate their time under heavy teaching tasks and try to spend some time on research work every day. Third, scientific research work must be carried out step by step. Some teachers, especially young teachers, due to their enthusiasm for research, like to do research work in many aspects, and often have a tendency to be eager for quick success, greedy for more, and rashly advancing; the result is just the opposite. Being greedy for more leads to "indigestion," and the foundation is not solid. Rashly advancing is easy to "fall backwards," and sometimes it even causes a situation of "never recovering." In order to prevent this bias, I think: young teachers must first develop the habit of studying specialized works of recent years, fully understand their content, and then further study them, absorb these results, and raise the research work to a creative height. In this way, the foundation can be consolidated, the technology will be skilled, and thus the chances of failure can be reduced and the effectiveness of research can be achieved. Fourth, finally, our teachers, especially the administrative leaders of the school, must eliminate the "booming and lively, empty and hollow" research propaganda style left over from the old society, and truly promote scientific research work. Let us adhere to the scientific attitude in our work to ensure our success in scientific research.

    复旦大学的科学研究工作
    复旦大学教务长　苏步青
    自去年学习了全国综合大学会议的决议以后，复旦大学的教师们进一步认识到进行科学研究工作的重要性和科学研究的广阔范围，进行科学研究的积极性有了很大提高。一学期来，科学研究工作已出现了一些新的萌芽，全校教师正在研究的专题有九十个，开设了六个专门讲座。科学研究工作在发挥教师的积极性与提高教学质量和科学水平上，已初步发生作用。
    在这短短的一学期内，我们的科学研究工作虽然有了开端，但如果要像苏联那样，把科学研究工作当作教师们的创造性的劳动，那末目前我们大学的这些研究工作还是微乎其微的，甚至其中大部分工作如编写教材、翻译苏联的科学著作、开设讲座等都不能算做科学研究了。当然，在中国的综合大学里，现在还不能这样要求。第一，旧中国遗留下来的高等学校，在院系调整之前，机构庞杂，畸形发展，尤其是大家对科学研究的认识很不一致，对过去的少数科学工作者的成就没有予以珍惜，更谈不上什么鼓舞和表扬，所以开展科学研究的基础是很差的。第二，个别学校在教师思想改造的学习中，曾提出以往科学研究工作的动机是完全来自名位思想，而指导年轻人进行研究工作，则说是使他们超政治超阶级的主要原因等等，这些似是而非的批判，也影响了科学研究工作的开展。第三，在院系调整之后，教师们普遍参加集体教学，由于大家还缺乏集体教学的经验，教师间的团结尚有待于加强。教师任课时间比过去都有增加，就不免有“教学第一，研究从缓”的看法。第四，也还有一部分未开课的教师，虽有充分的时间，但他们有“老的学问不要了，新的还没有学好”这一类的看法。这都在某种程度上阻碍了科学研究的开展。根据以上所述的实际情况，我们大学的科学研究工作，是在较低的要求下开始的。一学期来，我们虽然也获得了一些初步的体会，但经验仍不多。所以我在这里，只想把一些初步体会连同思想情况的分析以及个人对于今后努力方向的意见提出来供大家参考。
    第一、去年全国综合大学会议号召我们要结合教学开展科学研究，把编著良好教材这类工作也列入研究的范围之内，给我们指出了一个进行研究的方法。但这决不是说，编写教材已经合于科学研究的标准，更不能说，这就是科学研究工作的全部。编写教材是介绍已有的材料，适当加以增补删纂，使之适合于目前教学的需要，这是为了准备上课，不能称为研究工作。固然，科学研究工作者在编写教材时，尽可以把他在个别问题上的重要成就写到教材里去，可是这不过是介绍已获得的结果，也不能算做研究工作。科学研究是探讨未知的真理，发展和解决学术上的新问题，以提高现有的学术水平的，所以不能把它和编写教材混为一谈。那末为什么要结合教学来开展研究呢？我认为，这原因是在于：综合大学主要是教学机构，教学与研究工作是相互为用、相互提高的。因此它的研究工作就不能不和中国科学院有所区别，尤其是在目前，我们的教学工作尚有待于大力改革，还必须进一步为科学研究创造条件。我们往往感觉到教学程度太低，谈不到什么研究，正因为如此，我们必须大力开展研究，以丰富教学内容和提高教学质量，从而推进研究工作。例如，编译苏联的大学教材和新近的各种文献资料，来充实教学内容；或从资产阶级文化中去掉其有毒的部分而吸收其中尚有用处的部分，使它为教学服务，这些都应当算做开展研究的预备阶段了。一句话，要有科学研究，必须在结合教学和搞好教学的良好基础上，方能逐步开展研究。就今天的复旦大学来说，教师的业务水平颇有参差，各单位的物质条件也有好坏，决定于这两方面的科学研究的分量和范围也可以有很大的差别。尽管客观事实是这样，在教学工作极度繁重的今天，我们是必须明确认识教学和研究之间的密切关系，借以消除一部分教师认为两者在时间支配上有矛盾的这个不正确的看法。事实上，凡是搞好教学的地方，一定能够较早地开展研究工作；相反地，往往以忙乱为借口而不愿进行研究的教师一般也是搞不好教学的。这里必须指出，个别的老教授任课太多，或担任行政工作较重，没有充分时间从事于研究。年轻助教的教学工作过重，抽不出工夫来受老教师的指导，或硬做工作，致影响健康；还有一部分助教急于研究，同时参加好几门的讲座，花时间多而收效少。这些问题都是要予以重视而逐步加以解决的。
    第二、大家知道，科学研究必须联系实际。苏联科学的最大特点就是它能够解决实际问题。由于苏联正在建设共产主义社会，工业、农业、经济、文化等方面的工作都在提高了的科学基础上，大大地发展起来，所碰到的新问题也日益高深，使科学呈现出日新月异的情况。在苏联对科学研究工作的要求是很严格的，不进行科学研究工作的教师，就不能称为高等学校的教师。我们现在还不能这样要求，但努力创造条件是必要的。我们的实际是什么呢？由于我们目前需要培养大批建设干部和科学研究人才，结合教学可以说是结合国家建设的实际，因而教学是我们所必须联系的实际。不仅如此，为国防、工业、农业、经济、文化等建设的迫切需要，我国的科学技术界、医学界、农林界和财经部门等都是时时刻刻在工作着，这方面的发展难道我们大学教师可以漠不关心吗？当然，我们要关心这些发展来进行工作。但是，不应而且也不能机械地看待联系实际的问题，致使因此而停止本来就不多的科学研究工作。相反地，应当能联系多少，就联系多少，争取条件，抓紧机会，不要嫌问题太小，也不要怕问题太难，切切实实，稳做稳走，这不但可以解决目前需要，而且还可以借此先行“锻炼身手”，为解决行将到来的大批实际工作做好应战的“工事”。譬如说，我们物理系的一些教师继续进行以往还没有做成功的爱克斯光管研究，获得了初步成果，并且和有关部门合作，为国家解决了一部分的问题。化学系正在计划研究矿物，已经和有关的部门取得联系，彼方供给材料，我方把研究结果报告彼方。生物系的教授不断地和中国科学院人员前往华南研究植物。这些研究工作虽然还在刚刚开始的阶段，成绩还不大，但它的方向是正确的。另一方面，数学系开了“函数论”、“微分方程”和“微分几何”等专题报告，外国语言文学系设了“英诗研究”、“英国文学史”等讲座；这一方面是为了培养师资，他方面是为复旦大学养成“研究空气”，争取将来各教师都愿意进行科学研究工作，都感到科学研究工作是他的生活中有机的一部分，这些做法也无疑是正确的。但这些工作还是比较初步的，或许有人会怀疑这样的内容是不是离开国家的建设实际太远。但尽管如此，它们在整个科学发展的长远的途程上，仍旧有宝贵的价值；并且如果没有它们，那末科学研究将变成没有起点的凌空状态，等到第二个五年计划的时候再来开始想办法，那就太晚了。
    第三、在最近一年多的工作中，我深刻地体会到要使科学研究工作能够顺利开展起来而收到一定的效果，必须加强教师间的团结。这包括新老教师间的团结，老教师和老教师间的团结，甚至新教师和新教师间的团结。在老教师里面，也有几十年来坚守研究工作岗位而已获得相当成就的，他们指导研究，常感觉到现在年轻教师基础太差，对培养的前途信心不大。有些教师对研究工作抱着不屑为的态度，他们一般眼高手低，对新教师的指导仍未好好进行。还有些老教师自卑感很重，在新教师面前抬不起头来。个别老教师对向来由自己指导的年轻教师特别感到有劲，而对“非谪派”的则颇有“孺子不可教”的感慨。相反地，个别年轻教师看不起老教师，不肯虚心向他们请教。老教师和老教师之间，特别是同行的老教师之间，经过思想改造，基本上已经打垮了以往的“门户之见”和“文人相轻”的思想，但不可否认，这些思想还或多或少残留着，且对科学研究的发展带来不少的阻碍。例如，院系调整刚完了时，来自各校的教师彼此有隔膜，大家对于研究的“抱负”讳莫如深。在年轻教师之间则还存在比一比学问的意识。这些不团结的现象在学校党组织和行政方面的正确领导下，基本上已被纠正过来，也正是在这胜利的基础上，我们才能初步开展科学研究工作。为了更进一步搞好这项工作，使科学研究为国家的社会主义建设服务，我们要学习苏联科学家互相配合，互相帮助，团结合作的精神；继续提倡新老教师团结，老教师帮助新教师，青年教师向老教师学习，学生尊重教师的风气。目前首先要在教研组的领导下提出各人的研究计划并且用诚挚恳切的态度互相提出意见，取人所长，补己所短，适当地展开批评和自我批评。
    第四、对今后我们的科学研究工作提出如下的几点意见：一、对科学研究工作的要求必须相应地予以提高。由于过去一学期大家强调教学，对研究的要求定得很低，目的是为了鼓励大家走向研究的道路；可是，我们决不可一辈子停留在老地方，而必须在工作中提高对自己的要求。二、我们必须做到“人尽其力，物尽其用”。大家知道，科学研究是一件艰巨的劳动，失败多而收效慢，我们决没有理由把它看做一件轻松的工作。如果没有老教师的热心指导和新教师的虚心受教，那便不可能搞好研究工作。同时，有设备的系科，必须充分利用这些设备使其发挥最大效能；设备较差的单位就要依靠研究工作者的创造性，使在人力物力都感缺乏的情况下仍能开展工作。我们的教师在繁重的教学任务下要精确地支配自己的时间，尽可能地做到每天总有一部分时间花在研究工作上。三、科学研究工作必须按步就班地来进行。一部分教师特别是年轻教师，由于研究的热情，喜欢做多方面的研究工作，往往有急于求成、贪多冒进的倾向；其结果恰恰相反，贪多则“消化不良”，打的基础就不坚固，冒进则容易“后跌”，有时还引起“一蹶不振”的情况。为了防止这一偏向，我认为：年轻教师首先要养成研读最近几年来的专门论著的习惯，要完全理解其内容，然后进一步加以钻研，吸收这些成果，把研究工作提到创造性的高度。这样，基础既能巩固，技术又会熟练，因而可以减少失败的机会而收到研究的成效。四、最后，我们教师尤其是学校行政领导人要肃清旧社会遗留下来的“轰轰烈烈，空空洞洞”的研究宣传作风，切切实实地推进科学研究工作。让我们坚持工作中的科学态度，来保证我们在科学研究上的成功吧。
