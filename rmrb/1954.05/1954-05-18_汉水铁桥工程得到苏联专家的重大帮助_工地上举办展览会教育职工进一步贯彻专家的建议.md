Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 17th: A small exhibition on implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts was held at the Han River Railway Bridge construction site. Since its opening on May 8th, the exhibition has been visited daily by hundreds of workers and technicians participating in the construction of the Han River Railway Bridge and has been deeply educational.

The exhibition uses various vivid pictures to introduce the significant assistance provided by Soviet experts to the construction of the Han River Railway Bridge since the project began. People can see from the exhibition how Soviet experts value the quality of the project. In February of this year, after Soviet expert Oniskov arrived at the construction site, he discovered that some staff members had a habitual "rush repair" work style, which seriously affected the quality of the project. He immediately made suggestions to the leadership and repeatedly explained the dangers of disregarding quality with on-site examples at a special meeting convened for this purpose. Under the suggestion of the Soviet expert, a mass quality inspection campaign was launched on the construction site. Units such as the water area universally established a regular quality inspection system, and the carpentry area reinforced substandard wooden caissons. Expert Oniskov also suggested that an impact test be performed after each pipe pile was driven to check whether the bearing capacity of the pipe pile met the design requirements. Expert Shaburi suggested that steel bars be added to the foundation of each bridge pier and abutment, and the steel bars at the top of the pile must be exposed to extend into the foundation to increase the strength of the foundation. The pictures illustrate that the implementation of these suggestions played a decisive role in ensuring the quality of the entire underwater foundation project.

The exhibition also shows that Soviet experts paid great attention to implementing strict economization to reduce project costs. Expert Ruda suggested using reinforced concrete pipe piles instead of steel pipe piles for the foundation, which not only guarantees the same quality but also saves a large amount of steel for the country. Expert Oniskov saw that some machines on the construction site had very low efficiency and suggested reducing the number of machines and giving full play to the effectiveness of each machine. He also realistically suggested that crushed stone could be used without washing without affecting the quality, and the implementation of this suggestion saved 250 million yuan for all the stone works.

Soviet experts also made many efforts to speed up the construction of the Han River Railway Bridge. In order to ensure the on-time start of the Han River Railway Bridge, Expert Ruda personally participated in the preparatory work and formulated a pile driving plan. He suggested using the high-pressure water jet sinking pile method, using water pressure to flush open the sand layer at the bottom of the river so that the pipe piles could sink on their own, which could speed up the progress of the project and save a lot of manpower. He also repeatedly went to the relevant bridge factories to help improve the manufacture of cement pipe piles, ensuring the timely supply of pipe piles. With the help of Expert Shaburi, the pile driving work of the No. 4 pier was also completed five days ahead of schedule.

Whenever the project encountered many complex technical difficulties, Soviet experts used their superb technology to overcome them, allowing the project to proceed smoothly. The examples of this aspect exhibited at the exhibition are the most touching and admirable. In March of this year, when water leakage occurred in the steel sheet pile cofferdam of the No. 4 pier, divers went into the water to block it for several days without solving the problem. Expert Oniskov suggested adding a layer of steel sheet pile cofferdam outside the original cofferdam and filling the space between the two layers of cofferdam with soil, which eliminated the leakage. When the wooden caisson of the No. 5 pier sank, it tilted. This problem was also solved under the suggestion of Expert Oniskov, avoiding a possible major accident.

After visiting the exhibition, the employees were deeply educated and launched discussions, determined to further implement the suggestions of Soviet experts.

    汉水铁桥工程得到苏联专家的重大帮助
    工地上举办展览会教育职工进一步贯彻专家的建议
    【新华社武汉十七日电】汉水铁桥工地举办了一个小型的贯彻苏联专家建议展览会。展览会从五月八日开幕以来，每天都有成百个正在参加修建汉水铁桥的工人和技术人员去参观，并受到深刻的教育。
    这个展览会用各种生动的图片，集中地介绍了从工程开工以来苏联专家对汉水铁桥的建设所作的重大援助。人们从展览会上可以看到苏联专家是如何重视工程质量。今年二月，苏联专家奥尼斯柯夫来到工地后，发现工地上有些工作人员存在着习惯的“抢修”作风，因而严重地影响到工程质量。他立即向领导方面提出建议，并在为此召开的专门会议上用现场实例反复说明不顾质量的危害性。在苏联专家的建议下，工地上展开了群众性质量检查工作，水上工区等单位普遍建立了经常性的质量检查制度，木工工区把不合规格的木沉井重新加固。奥尼斯柯夫专家还建议每根管桩打好后作冲击试验，用以检查管桩的承载力是否合乎设计要求；沙布里专家建议在每个桥台和桥墩的基础内加扎钢筋，桩顶的钢筋必须露出，以便伸入基础内增加基础的强度。图片说明，这些建议的执行对保证整个水下基础工程的质量起了决定的作用。
    展览会还说明了苏联专家十分注意实行严格的节约，以降低工程成本。鲁达专家建议用钢筋混凝土管桩代替钢管桩打基础，不但同样保证质量，而且可以为国家节省大批钢材。奥尼斯柯夫专家看到工地上有些机具使用效率很低，建议减少机具，充分发挥每一机具的效能。他又实事求是地提出碎石可以不洗也不影响质量的建议，这个建议实行后全部石方就节省了二亿五千万元。
    在加快汉水铁桥的建设速度方面，苏联专家们也作了许多努力。鲁达专家为了保证汉水铁桥按期开工，曾亲自参加准备工作，拟订打桩计划。他建议采用高压射水沉桩法，利用水的压力把河底沙层冲开，使管桩自己下沉，这样就可以加速工程进度，大量节省人工。他还三番两次地亲自到有关桥梁工厂帮助改进水泥管桩的制造，保证了管桩的及时供应。在沙布里专家帮助下，四号桥墩的打桩工作也比原计划提前五天完成。
    每当工程遇到许多复杂的技术困难的时候，苏联专家都运用自己精湛的技术加以克服，使工程得以顺利进行。展览会上展览的这方面的事例是最令人感动和钦佩的。今年三月份在四号桥墩钢板围堰内发生漏水现象时，潜水员们下水堵塞了好几天不能解决问题。奥尼斯柯夫专家建议在原来的围堰外面加打一层钢板围堰，在两层围堰中再填上泥土，结果漏水的现象消除了。五号桥墩的木沉井下沉时发生了倾斜的现象，这个问题也在奥尼斯柯夫专家的建议下得到解决，并避免了可能发生的重大事故。
    参观过展览会的职工们受到深刻的教育后，回去都展开了讨论，决心进一步贯彻苏联专家的建议。
