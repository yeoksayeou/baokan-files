Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Although the American policy of obstruction and sabotage has already met with obvious failure in the first stage of the Geneva Conference, signs indicate that the American authorities are continuing this policy, hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and particularly intensifying efforts to prevent the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The American representative attending the Geneva Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, returned to Washington on the 4th. Before leaving Geneva, he hastily held a series of "emergency meetings" with the representatives of America's allies, urging them to quickly join the United States in organizing a Southeast Asian aggressive alliance to expand the flames of war in Indochina. On the same day he returned to the United States, a dispatch from Washington by the United Press quoted Washington officials as saying: "Dulles is determined to push forward with his 'united action' plan to save Southeast Asia, regardless of recent diplomatic setbacks." Dulles' statement upon leaving Geneva, that the principle of so-called "collective security" (actually collective aggressive war) should be applied in Indochina, precisely proves this point.

Under the influence of the American ruling clique's intensified efforts to obstruct peace in Indochina, the French authorities are playing a double game on the eve of the negotiations on the restoration of peace in Indochina. French Prime Minister Laniel's speech in the French National Assembly on the 4th provides an example. Laniel, imitating the tone of American propaganda, slandered China's participation in the Indochina war, falsely claiming that there were so-called "Chinese artillery units" on the Indochina battlefield. This unfounded argument is the same as Dulles' recent fabrication that China was "very close" to joining the Indochina war. The intention is to create an excuse for the United States to directly participate in the "internationalization" of the Indochina war. Laniel also stated that "we are not responsible for any threat of escalating or expanding the war." However, just before the opening of the Geneva Conference, Western news agencies reported that the French representative attending the conference, Bidault, had formally requested the United States to send the U.S. Air Force to directly participate in the Indochina war. American news agencies are trying to make France act in accordance with American intentions. The Associated Press predicted that "France's attitude is becoming increasingly tough" and that "France will not stand idly by," but is prepared to continue fighting hard on the battlefield. The United Press also touted that some American officials want France to "strengthen" its attitude in the negotiations, "which will increase the momentum of Dulles' plan ('united action' plan)." According to a Reuters report on the 5th, Paris is now "generally concerned that Bidault is colluding with the U.S. government to involve the United States in the (Indochina) war." This concern of the French public is entirely understandable.

The people of all countries, including the French people, advocate an immediate end to the Indochina war, but the United States government is deliberately obstructing the realization of peace in Indochina, and the French official's double-dealing is clearly related to the conspiracy of the American ruling clique, and not in line with the wishes of the French people.

### 美国加紧阻挠恢复印度支那的和平  法国当局在印度支那问题上玩弄着两面手法

    美国加紧阻挠恢复印度支那的和平
    法国当局在印度支那问题上玩弄着两面手法
    【新华社六日讯】尽管美国的阻挠和破坏政策已经在日内瓦会议的第一个阶段中遭到了明显的失败，但是迹象显示：美国当局仍在继续这种政策，阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，特别是加紧进行阻止印度支那恢复和平。
    出席日内瓦会议的美国代表、美国国务卿杜勒斯已经在四日回到华盛顿。他在离开日内瓦之前曾经匆匆忙忙地和美国的盟国代表举行一系列的“紧急会议”，鞭策它们赶快和美国一道来组织东南亚侵略联盟，以便扩大印度支那的战火。在他回到美国的同一天，合众社从华盛顿发出的电讯引用华盛顿官员的话说：“杜勒斯决心不顾最近的外交挫折，推行其挽救东南亚的‘联合行动’计划。”杜勒斯在离开日内瓦时所发表的要在印度支那运用所谓“集体安全”（其实是集体侵略战争）原则的声明，正好证明了这一点。
    在美国统治集团加紧布置阻挠印度支那和平的影响下，法国当局在关于恢复印度支那和平问题的谈判就要开始的前夕玩弄着两面手法。法国总理拉尼埃四日在法国国民议会中的讲话提供了一个例证。拉尼埃模仿美国宣传的口吻，诬蔑中国参预印度支那战争，他造谣说印度支那战场上有所谓“中国炮兵部队”。这种毫无根据的论调与不久以前杜勒斯捏造所谓中国已“十分接近”于参加印度支那战争的说法如出一辙。其用意就在于为美国的直接参加使印度支那战争的“国际化”制造借口。拉尼埃还表示对于“使战争趋向激烈或扩大的威胁，我们这方面是没有责任的”。但是，就在日内瓦会议开幕的前夕，西方国家通讯社纷纷传出，参加会议的法国代表皮杜尔已正式要求美国派遣美国空军直接参加印度支那战争。美国通讯社正在力图使法国按照美国心意的方针行事。美联社预告，“法国态度日渐强硬”，“法国将不是缩起双手不干”，而是准备在战场上继续大干一场。合众社也鼓吹，某些美国官员要法国在谈判中的态度“加强”，“其结果就会增加杜勒斯计划（‘联合行动’计划）的推动力”。据路透社五日报道，巴黎方面现在“普遍担心皮杜尔与美国政府串通一气使美国参加（印度支那）战争”。法国公众的这种忧虑是完全可以理解的。
    包括法国人民在内的全世界各国人民主张立即停止印度支那战争，但是美国政府却在处心积虑阻挠印度支那和平的实现，而法国官方的两面做法显然是和美国统治集团的阴谋有关，而不是和法国人民的愿望一致的。
