    International Olympic Committee Passes Resolution
    to Continue Recognizing the Legitimate Status of the Chinese Olympic Committee
   [Report from this newspaper] The 49th session of the International Olympic Committee was held in Athens, Greece from May 10th to 14th. At the meeting, a resolution was passed by a vote of 23 to 21 to continue recognizing the legitimate status of the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) within the organization. Although the International Olympic Committee agreed in 1952 to allow China to send athletes to the 15th Olympic Games, it had delayed resolving the issue of China's legitimate status within the organization until this 49th session.
    [Another report] The International Amateur Wrestling Federation held a representative conference in Tokyo, Japan on May 20th. At the meeting, it was resolved to accept the Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) as a formal member organization of the federation.

    国际奥林匹克委员会通过决议
    继续承认中国奥林匹克委员会的合法地位
   【本报讯】国际奥林匹克委员会第四十九届委员会议于五月十日至十四日在希腊雅典举行。会上以二十三票对二十一票通过决议，继续承认中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）在该会中的合法地位。按国际奥林匹克委员会在一九五二年虽同意我国派运动员参加第十五届奥林匹克运动会，但在第四十九届委员会议以前，对我国在该会中的合法地位一直拖延未予解决。
    【又讯】国际业余摔角联合会于五月二十日在日本东京举行代表大会，会上决议通过中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）为该会正式会员组织。
