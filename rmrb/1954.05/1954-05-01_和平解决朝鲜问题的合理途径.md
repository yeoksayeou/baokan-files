Geneva dispatches

    A Reasonable Path to a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue
    By Our Correspondent Li Zhuang
    On April 27th, the first day of the actual discussion of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference, Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chief Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, presented a "Plan on Restoring the National Unity of Korea and Holding Free All-Korea Elections." This plan immediately attracted widespread attention from the local public opinion. After the adjournment of the meeting, the delegations of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States held press conferences. The interest of most reporters attending these press conferences was clearly focused on the plan proposed by Foreign Minister Nam Il. The best proof is that many reporters inquired in detail about the various details of this plan at various press conferences.
    Foreign Minister Nam Il's speech and his proposed plan pointed out the correct way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. This is: withdrawing foreign troops; holding free national elections with the participation of all the people of North and South Korea under the condition of ensuring that the people enjoy genuine and complete democratic freedom, free from foreign interference and the pressure of local government authorities and terrorist groups on voters, in order to form a unified government of Korea. This plan fully conforms to the interests and actual situation of the Korean people, which is obvious.
    People familiar with the situation in Korea know that in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has proposed peaceful unification of Korea three times; these proposals were rejected by the Syngman Rhee government supported by the United States. The resolution adopted by the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in 1945, which conformed to the fundamental interests of the entire Korean people, was discarded by the United States; under the conditions of suppression by military police, illegal separate elections were held in South Korea, and Korea was thus artificially divided into two worlds by the United States and the Syngman Rhee group.
    While the people of South Korea groaned under the brutal rule of the US-Rhee regime, economic and cultural construction in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea flourished, and everywhere was a new and prosperous scene. People remember that Korea held two very different elections in 1948. On May 10 of that year, the election of the South Korean "National Assembly" presided over by the US occupation forces was held under the coercion and control of the occupation forces and military police and secret agents, and less than 30 percent of South Korean voters participated in the vote. The ugly scandals of the US occupiers and Syngman Rhee in the "election" had spread all over the world. In contrast, on August 25 of that year, a general election including all the people of North and South Korea was held to elect the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. 99.97 percent of voters in North Korea participated in the vote, and 77.52 percent of voters in South Korea risked their lives to participate in secret voting. It is very clear which of these two elections truly expressed the democratic and free will of all the Korean people. The people have the best eyes; they know where to go.
    It was in order to impose the dark and corrupt system, which was rejected by all the Korean people, on the free people of North Korea, and thus use Korea as a springboard for aggression against China, that the US rulers instructed Syngman Rhee to launch a bloody attack on North Korea, plunging the Korean people into blood for three years.
    These are the historical facts.
    When Byun Young-tae, the representative of the South Korean government, spoke on the 27th, he also said that he wanted to provide some "historical facts." But what facts did he provide? It is enough to give just one example. For example, he said that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese planes never bombed Yan'an once; and he also said that the Chinese Communist Party did not lead the Chinese people in the War of Resistance. No wonder some people who have been to Yan'an here read Byun Young-tae's speech on "historical facts" and recalled the scene of the democratic holy land Yan'an being bombed into rubble by Japanese planes at that time. They could not help but sneer at Byun Young-tae's nonsense that obliterated the facts. The fact that the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country to persevere in the War of Resistance Against Japan and fought heroically is well known to the world. Byun Young-tae's slander here is the most obvious.
    Byun Young-tae's irresponsible and slanderous remarks cannot conceal the darkness of the Syngman Rhee group in the slightest. Who doesn't know that there are as many pro-Japanese elements in the Syngman Rhee group as there are hairs on an ox. Syngman Rhee himself was once a servant of the secret imperial council of the Korean king, and he actively cooperated with pro-Japanese elements. During the Korean people's war against Japan, he hid in the United States and lived a licentious and shameless life. Only after the Soviet Red Army liberated northern Korea was he sent back to Korea by the Americans to impose his dictatorial rule on the people of South Korea.
    Byun Young-tae's speech was completely a distortion of facts, reversal of black and white, evasion of guilt, and slander against China and the Soviet Union. Although, as the facts quoted above show, his rumors are very clumsy. Apart from these rumors, even a shadow of a concrete proposal on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue cannot be found in his speech. The representative of the Syngman Rhee group fully exposed his true nature as a running dog here, repeatedly demanding that the US invading army continue to stay in South Korea in order to maintain the US's violent rule over South Korea and be a puppet emperor under the support of the US bayonets. Therefore, Byun Young-tae's speech on the 27th could not help but make people ask: Why did Byun Young-tae come to Geneva? Is it to make the Geneva Conference truly resolve the Korean issue, or to undermine the Geneva Conference?
    If Foreign Minister Nam Il's speech is something that anyone here—including Dulles, who temporarily delayed his speech—cannot but consider, then the general reaction of the local media to Byun Young-tae's speech is nothing more than a contemptuous shrug.
    However, the entire Korean people, the entire Asian people, and the people of the world all hope that the Geneva Conference will truly resolve the Korean issue, because this is in the interests of the Korean people and helps consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

### 和平解决朝鲜问题的合理途径

    和平解决朝鲜问题的合理途径
    本报记者　李　庄
    四月二十七日，日内瓦会议实际讨论朝鲜问题的第一天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团首席代表南日外务相提出了“关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案”。这个方案立即引起了此间舆论广泛的重视。会议休会以后，中华人民共和国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、法国、英国和美国代表团都举行了记者招待会。参加这些招待会的多数记者的兴趣，显然集中在南日外务相提出的方案上面。许多记者在各个招待会上详细地询问这个方案的各个细节，就是最好的证明。
    南日外务相的发言和他提出的方案，指出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正确途径。这就是：撤退外国军队；在保证人民享有真正的完全的民主自由的条件下，举行南北朝鲜全体人民参加的不受外国干涉及地方政权当局和恐怖集团对选民施加压力的全国自由选举，以组成朝鲜的统一政府。这个方案完全符合朝鲜人民的利益和实际状况，是显而易见的。
    熟悉朝鲜情况的人们都晓得，为了和平解决朝鲜问题，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾经三次提出和平统一朝鲜的建议；这些建议都被美国支持的李承晚政府所拒绝了。一九四五年莫斯科三国外长会议所通过的符合全朝鲜人民根本利益的决议，被美国丢到脑后了；在宪兵警察镇压的条件下，南朝鲜曾进行了非法的单独选举，朝鲜就这样被美国和李承晚集团人为地分成两个世界。
    在南朝鲜人民呻吟于水深火热的美李暴力统治下的同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的经济建设和文化建设则蓬勃发展，到处是新生的繁荣的景象。人们记得：朝鲜曾在一九四八年举行过两次截然不同的选举。那年五月十日，美国占领军主持的南朝鲜“国民议会”的选举，是在占领军和宪兵、警察、特务的逼迫和控制之下举行的，参加投票的南朝鲜选民还不足百分之三十。美国占领者和李承晚在“选举”中的丑行秽闻，曾经传遍全世界。与此相反，那年八月二十五日，为选举朝鲜最高人民会议，举行了包括南北朝鲜全体人民的普选。北朝鲜有百分之九十九点九七的选民参加投票，南朝鲜冒着生命危险参加秘密投票的选民也达百分之七十七点五二。在这两次选举中，那一次真正表现了全朝鲜人民的民主和自由的意志，是很清楚的。人民是最有眼力的，他们是知道何去何从的。
    美国统治者就是为了把全朝鲜人民所共弃的黑暗腐化的制度强加于北朝鲜自由人民的头上，并从而将朝鲜作为侵略中国的跳板，才指使李承晚发动了向北朝鲜的血腥进攻，将朝鲜人民投入血泊中达三年之久。
    这就是历史的事实。
    南朝鲜政府的代表卞荣泰在二十七日发言时，也说要提供一些“历史事实”。但他提供的是些什么事实呢？这只要举一个例子就够了。例如，他说，在抗日战争期间，日本飞机一次也没有轰炸过延安；又说，中国共产党根本没有领导中国人民进行抗战。难怪这里一些到过延安的人看了卞荣泰的关于“历史事实”的发言稿，想起民主圣地延安当时被日本飞机炸成一片瓦砾的情景，对于卞荣泰的抹煞事实的胡言乱语都不禁报之以讥笑。中国共产党领导全国人民坚持抗日战争英勇奋斗的事实，乃是举世周知的。卞荣泰含血喷人，在这里表现得最明显不过了。
    卞荣泰的不负责的和诽谤性的发言，丝毫也无法掩盖李承晚集团的一片黑暗。谁不知道，李承晚集团中的亲日分子多如牛毛。李承晚本人就曾经是朝鲜国王秘密御前会议的臣仆，他曾与亲日分子积极合作。在朝鲜人民抗日期间，他躲在美国过着荒淫无耻的生活，只是在苏联红军解放朝鲜北部以后，才被美国人送回朝鲜，把他的独裁统治强加在南朝鲜人民的头上。
    卞荣泰的发言完全是歪曲事实、颠倒黑白、推卸罪责和诬蔑中国与苏联的胡说。虽然正像上面引述的事实那样，他的造谣是很笨拙的。除了这些谣言以外，从他的发言中连一点点关于和平解决朝鲜问题的具体建议的影子也找不到。李承晚集团的代表在这里充分暴露了自己的奴才本相，一再要美国侵略军继续留在南朝鲜，以便保持美国对南朝鲜的暴力统治，在美国的刺刀的支持下，当一个儿皇帝。因此，卞荣泰二十七日的发言，不免使人们发问：卞荣泰到底是为什么到日内瓦来的呢？是为了使日内瓦会议真正解决朝鲜问题，还是来破坏日内瓦会议？
    如果说南日外务相的发言，是这里任何人——包括临时延迟发言的杜勒斯在内——所不能不加以考虑的，那么，卞荣泰的发言在这里舆论界所得到的一般反应，不过是轻蔑的耸肩而已。
    但是，全朝鲜人民，全亚洲人民和全世界人民都希望日内瓦会议真正解决朝鲜问题，因为这是符合于朝鲜人民的利益，并有助于巩固亚洲和世界和平的。
