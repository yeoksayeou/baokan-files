The Guangdong Branch of the China Silk Company, starting in mid-March, worked with the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Sericulture Improvement Institute and other units to conduct silkworm cocoon pre-purchase work in eight counties including Shunde, Zhongshan, Nanhai, and Xinhui. To date, a total of more than 49,000 dan of white and yellow cocoons have been pre-purchased, exceeding the plan. According to preliminary statistics from five districts in Shunde County, four districts in Zhongshan County, and Nanhai and Heshan counties, approximately 58.5% of the total number of silkworm farmers in the area participated in the pre-sale.

Through pre-purchasing, the difficulties in production for silkworm farmers were resolved, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for production. Some silkworm and mulberry farmers in Shunde and Nanhai counties spontaneously requested to organize mutual aid teams to raise silkworms together. The Agricultural Production Cooperative of the Eleventh Cooperative of Datong Nanxiang Village in the Fifth District of Nanhai County used the silkworm cocoon deposit to purchase four additional sheets of white cocoon silkworm eggs, added a large number of silkworm rearing tools, and expanded the silkworm rearing plan. Chen Woting and Hu Liu, silkworm farmers in Baiteng Township, Ninth District of Shunde County, who had not raised silkworms for several years, are also preparing to resume silkworm farming.

During the China Silk Company Guangdong Branch's pre-purchase of silkworm cocoons, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also sent cadres to Gaoyao, Yunan, Deqing and other counties to help farmers improve silkworm rearing techniques, supplied more than 2,800 sheets of the first batch of silkworm eggs, and provided farmers with more than 4.7 million mulberry seedlings free of charge. Some supply and marketing cooperatives expanded the supply of means of production to meet the needs of farmers. This further increased the enthusiasm of silkworm farmers for production.

    广东省完成蚕茧预购计划
    中国丝绸公司广东省分公司从三月中旬开始，会同广东省农林厅蚕桑改进所等单位在顺德、中山、南海、新会等八个县进行蚕茧预购工作，到最近共预购了白茧、黄茧四万九千余担，超额完成了计划。据顺德县五个区、中山县四个区和南海、鹤山两个县的初步统计，参加预售的蚕户约占当地总蚕户数的百分之五十八点五。
    通过预购，使蚕农解决了生产上的困难，大大地提高了生产积极性。顺德、南海两县有些蚕农、桑农，自动要求组织互助组，共同育蚕。南海县第五区大同南乡十一社村农业生产合作社，将蚕茧定金增购了白茧蚕种四张，添置了大批蚕具，扩大了养蚕计划。顺德县第九区白藤乡已经几年没有养蚕的蚕农陈沃廷、胡六也准备恢复养蚕的工作。
    在中国丝绸公司广东省分公司预购蚕茧期间，省农林厅也派出干部到高要、郁南、德庆等县帮助农民改良养蚕技术，供应了第一造蚕种二千八百多张，并向农民免费供应桑苗四百七十多万株。有些供销合作社扩大供应了生产资料，以满足农民的要求。这就进一步提高了蚕农的生产积极性。
