    Longyan Iron Mine Ma Wanshui Tunneling Team
　　Exceeds First Half Production Plan and Achieves Safe Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Longyan Iron Mine's National Model Worker Ma Wanshui Tunneling Team, on May 9th, exceeded its first half production plan by 5.76% and achieved safe production.
    Since studying the Party's General Line for the Transition Period, the workers of the Ma Wanshui Tunneling Team have enhanced their work enthusiasm and actively launched a technical innovation movement in the production increase and economy labor competition, greatly increasing labor productivity. They further consolidated and improved Ma Wanshui's advanced experience, and improved the "sparse hole deep hole operation method," deepening the hole depth from 1.5 meters to 2.2 meters. Based on Ma Wanshui's advanced experience, they also created the advanced operation methods of "one shovel fill," immediately building canopies after blasting, connecting turnouts, and other work methods, reducing the brushing and bottoming processes, accelerating progress, and ensuring specifications. They also, based on Ma Wanshui's advanced experience, flexibly applied operation methods such as "two slot pulls, one blast," "middle slot pull," and "side wedge slot pull," mastering the rock's joints for operation, thus ensuring the completion of tasks in different rock conditions.
    They also tried and promoted new tools such as loading machines, electric scrapers, and frame bellows, greatly reducing physical labor, saving labor, and improving production efficiency. For example, it used to take three people three minutes to load a car of ore, but with a loading machine, it only takes one minute and twenty-five seconds to load a car. Previously, four people would pull ore down a slope of more than 20 degrees, only pulling eleven or twelve cars per shift. With an electric scraper, only two people are needed to operate, and more than thirty cars can be pulled per shift.

　　超额完成上半年生产计划并做到安全生产
    【本报讯】龙烟铁矿全国劳动模范马万水掘进小组，已于五月九日超额百分之五点七六完成上半年生产计划，并做到安全生产。
    马万水掘进小组工人自从学习党在过渡时期的总路线以来，提高了劳动热情，在增产节约劳动竞赛中积极展开技术革新运动，大大提高了劳动生产率。他们进一步巩固与提高了马万水的先进经验，改进了“稀眼深孔作业法”，打眼深度由一点五公尺加深到二点二公尺。在马万水先进经验的基础上，他们又创造了“一杓盛”的先进操作法、爆破后立即进行搭棚子、接道叉等工作方法，减去了刷帮卧底工序，加速了进度，保证了规格。他们又根据马万水的先进经验，灵活地运用了“两次拉槽一次爆破”、“中间拉槽”、“旁楔型拉槽”等操作方法，掌握岩层的节理进行操作，因而在不同的岩石情况下，保证了任务的完成。
    他们还试用与推广了装车机、电筢子、架子风箱等新式工具，大大减轻了体力劳动，节省了人工，提高了生产效率。如过去三个人装一车矿石要三分钟，用装车机装一车只需一分二十五秒。以前四个人由二十多度的坡度上往下扒矿石，一班只扒十一、二车，使用电筢子只要两个人操作，每班就能扒三十多车。
