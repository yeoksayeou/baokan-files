    Striving to Complete the 1954 Mineral Prospecting Plan
    Li Siguang, Minister of Geology of the Central People's Government
    (I)
    In the past four years, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, the arduous efforts of all geological workers, and the warm support of the people of the whole country, the geological work department has found and proven certain minerals and mineral reserves of a certain grade necessary for national construction. However, for the entire cause of national socialist industrialization, resource exploration work is only the first step. How to meet the ever-increasing demand for mineral resources for national construction is still an urgent problem facing geological workers. Advanced Soviet experience tells us that the development of underground resources must go through a certain exploration procedure: exploration work must be done well before the technical design of enterprise construction is compiled; and exploration work must be carried out on the basis of good prospecting work. If we do not follow the exploration procedure, we will not only waste national funds and reduce labor efficiency, but also may delay the progress of national construction.
    In order to continuously open up new bases for exploration work, to find more and better minerals, and to meet the current and long-term construction requirements of the country, the Central Geological Department has decided to carry out large-scale prospecting work starting this year. Doing a good job in prospecting has become a new and very important task for geological workers.
    (II)
    To do a good job in prospecting, we must correctly understand the nature of this work and recognize the main problems to be solved by this work. This correct understanding and recognition is the basis for forming a correct guiding ideology. With a correct guiding ideology, there will be no major deviations in formulating concrete plans and implementing the steps and methods of the plan, and we will not take or take fewer detours.
      First of all, we must clarify the purpose of prospecting work. The main task of this prospecting work is to find mineral reserve areas and continuously open up new areas for future exploration work. In the past, some people believed that prospecting was just for geological research, and took the filling of detailed geological maps as the purpose, paying little or no attention to the discovery and careful study of mineral deposits and ore bodies, especially never attaching importance to the full use of trench exploration, shallow well exploration, sampling, chemical analysis and other methods to expose ore bodies and find out the shape, size, grade and other issues of the ore bodies, so they could not make a correct evaluation of the mining area. This approach is obviously not in line with current needs. Some people also believe that prospecting is "digging and drilling when you see a mine," without the need for geological mapping and research work, and without a basic understanding of the geological conditions and ore body conditions, they deploy a large amount of mountain work. This approach is obviously incorrect. We should combine the investigation and research of general geological phenomena (such as strata, structure, rock, etc.) with the investigation and research of the ore body itself and the corresponding, sufficient light mountain work to achieve the purpose of clarifying the ore conditions, giving the mining area an appropriate evaluation, and providing the necessary information for preliminary exploration design.
    Secondly, it must be clear that prospecting is a long-term job. With the development of national socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the mineral resources and geological data we need will not only increase in quantity, but also increase in variety. In order to ensure the planned and rhythmic progress of national construction, it is necessary to ensure that the supply of mineral raw materials can be balanced in a timely manner. The so-called timely means that not only should the geological department immediately provide the mineral data and other geological data urgently needed for the technical design of all important industrial constructions, but more importantly, the provision of such data should be one step ahead of the formulation of industrial construction plans. The formulation of a rational distribution plan for national industrial zones depends to a large extent on the geological department's discovery of new mining areas. Therefore, such an arduous task cannot be solved by a sudden, short-term job. Prospecting should be a long-term job with a high degree of planning and foresight. In the process of national planned economic development, appropriate arrangements must be made for prospecting work from time to time. From this long-term perspective, all organizations and facilities of prospecting work itself should also be considered for the long term. Moreover, this is not only a requirement of national construction, but also the characteristics of geological work itself require long-term consideration. Because each region has its own special geological conditions and other special circumstances. The more profound the cadres participating in prospecting work understand these conditions and circumstances, the better the work can be done; and the accumulation of experience in this area also takes a considerable amount of time. Therefore, once the prospecting team is organized and the work progresses to a certain stage, it should not be easily disbanded or canceled because it is considered to have come to an end.
    Third, it must be clear that prospecting is a comprehensive job. According to the needs of the country's current and long-term construction for a certain mineral, and according to the specific geological conditions of a certain area, when we carry out prospecting and mineral exploration work in that area, we can focus on finding one or several minerals, which is completely correct. However, we cannot ignore other minerals that may be discovered or have already been encountered in the local area. This is not only because understanding other minerals other than the planned minerals can often help or even deepen our understanding of the distribution law of the main minerals; it is also not only because we can avoid waste of manpower and material resources in the work and give play to the efficiency of each prospecting work; more importantly, it is because understanding multiple minerals in a region can help us correctly evaluate the economic value of the main minerals. For example, in a mining area that is mainly iron ore, copper ore is sometimes associated with iron ore, and this copper ore will obviously affect the economic value of iron ore.
    Not only should the objects of prospecting be comprehensive, but the methods of prospecting should not be limited to direct investigation work such as mapping, chemical analysis, and drilling; but should also take into account theoretical research in aspects such as strata, structure, and rocks. Only by combining research work with field investigation can we better complete the prospecting task. Because the law that various minerals are accompanied by their corresponding geological conditions often plays a guiding role in mineral exploration, we can only continuously grasp these laws from the research of practical problems in order to more scientifically and systematically arrange exploration work.
      (III)
    This year's prospecting work is carried out under the unified leadership of the Central Geological Department and in close combination with schools. The number of students participating in prospecting from schools alone is more than 1,200 this year. Therefore, the purpose of this year's prospecting is not only to complete the production tasks, but also to complete the production internship requirements of the schools. The prospecting work organized in this way will definitely strengthen and consolidate the connection between the production and education departments.
    Some people can't help but worry: universities easily emphasize teaching research and production internships, and geological departments easily emphasize production tasks. Will there be conflicts if the two are organized together? We say that this task is unified and consistent. As long as everyone has a correct and comprehensive understanding of prospecting and continuously improves the methods of leadership and organization, conflicts can be overcome. Moreover, organizing together has many benefits for both. As far as teachers are concerned, participating in prospecting means participating in production practice. They can get many things that are not easy to get within the scope of the school. As far as the staff of the production department are concerned, whether they are engineers or employees, they are usually busy with tasks and work in a remote area, and they rarely have the opportunity to contact the outside world, so their understanding of the problems is limited to a certain extent. Taking advantage of the arrival of the prospecting team organized this time, they can exchange experiences and improve themselves through extensive contact. As for young students, of course, they will gain more sensory knowledge in various aspects from prospecting.
    Some people may also worry: students have not received comprehensive training, and if they are asked to participate in production work, I am afraid that they will not be able to meet the requirements of production work, and it is even more difficult to expect them to have any discoveries. Soviet experience has proven that this idea is conservative. Among the Soviet geological experts who are helping us work in China now, several of them participated in the discovery of huge coalfields such as Donbass and Kuznetsk as students. Young students in the Mao Zedong era can definitely contribute their strength to this work.
      (IV)
    Since the personnel of the prospecting team come from all parties, with different daily work, different experiences, and different living habits, strengthening the unity of personnel from all parties should become the primary issue of each team. Responsible cadres, senior technicians and school teachers of each team must unite on the basis of mutual respect, mutual learning, and everything for the common completion of the prospecting task. Only when the responsible cadres of each team unite into a strong leading core, clearly divide labor, give play to the strength of collective leadership, and give play to democracy within the team, can they unite all team members and make the whole team a strong, conscious, and organized team. And such a team is the most powerful guarantee for us to successfully complete the prospecting task.
    Since prospecting work is to be carried out in a vast area, it is difficult to imagine that the work can be done well without the support of the local Party committee, government and the broad masses of the people. Therefore, each prospecting team should strive for the guidance and help of the local Party committee and government, should strictly abide by the mass discipline, and should do more publicity and explanation work on prospecting to the masses to obtain their help, especially in ethnic minority areas, they should abide by the ethnic policies and respect the living habits of ethnic minorities. Doing a good job in mass relations can not only reduce many difficulties in the work, but also obtain the active and initiative help of the masses. Although the people of our country still lack rich geological and mineral knowledge, they are enthusiastic about mineral exploration. In the past year or so, the Ministry of Geology has received thousands of mineral reporting letters from all over the country, many of which can become clues for our mineral exploration in this prospecting. The Ministry of Geology emphasized in the decision of this prospecting work: each team should visit the original mineral reporters, check the mineral reporting locations, and give the original mineral reporters a reply and encouragement for the past mass mineral reports in their prospecting area. All team staff should strengthen contact with the local masses and obtain the support of the masses in the spirit of being responsible to the masses in the decision. Only in this way can we have a broader and deeper foundation for successfully completing the prospecting task.
    The great and glorious prospecting task falls on our shoulders. Comrades who are all participating in the prospecting work, I hope that you will give play to the spirit of collectivism in your work, overcome difficulties, learn with humility, accumulate experience, and wish you a successful and comprehensive completion of this year's prospecting task!

    为完成一九五四年矿产普查计划而奋斗
    中央人民政府地质部部长　李四光
    （一）
    四年来，由于中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导，苏联专家的热诚帮助，全体地质工作人员的艰苦努力和全国人民的热烈支援，地质工作部门已经为国家找到和探明了某些在建设上必需的矿产和一定等级的矿产储量。但是对整个国家社会主义工业化的事业来说，资源勘探工作，还只走了第一步。如何满足国家建设对矿产资源日益扩大的要求，还是地质工作人员当前所面临的亟待解决的问题，苏联先进经验告诉我们，开发地下资源是要经过一定的勘探程序的：在编制企业建设的技术设计之前，必须做好勘探工作；而勘探工作又必须在普查工作做好的基础上进行。如果我们不按照勘探程序办事，不独将浪费国家的资财、降低劳动效率，而且还可能延缓国家建设事业的进展。
    为了给勘探工作不断开辟新的基地，以找到更多更好的矿产，满足国家当前和长远的建设要求，中央地质部决定从今年起开展大规模的普查工作，做好普查工作，就成为地质工作人员一个新的，十分重要的任务。
    （二）
    要做好普查工作，必须正确地了解这项工作的性质，认清这项工作要解决哪些主要问题。这种正确的了解和认识是形成正确的指导思想的基础。有了正确的指导思想，在拟订具体计划和实现计划的步骤与方法上，才不致发生重大的偏差，才能不走或少走弯路。
      首先，要明确普查工作的目的性。这次普查工作的主要任务是寻找矿产后备地，为今后的勘探工作不断地开辟新的地区。过去有人认为普查只是作地质上的研究，把填制详细的地质图当作目的，不注意或很少注意矿床、矿体的发现和仔细研究，尤其从不重视充分地利用槽探、浅井探、取样、化验等方法，以揭露矿体，查明矿体的形状、大小、品位等等问题，因而对矿区不能作出正确的评价。这种作法显然是不能符合当前需要的。也有的人认为普查是“见到矿就挖、就钻”，不必进行地质填图和研究工作，而在地质情况和矿体情况还未大体了解之前，动辄布置很大的山地工作量，这种作法显然也是不正确的。我们应当把一般地质现象的调查研究（如地层、构造、岩石等等情况）和对矿体本身的调查研究及相应的、足够的轻型山地工作结合起来，以达到查明矿情，给矿区以适当评价，为初步勘探设计提供所需资料的目的。
    其次，要明确普查是一个长期性的工作。随着国家社会主义工业化和农业集体化的发展，我们所需要的矿产资源和地质资料不独在数量方面将日益增加，而且在种类方面也必将日益增多。为了保证国家建设事业有计划、有节奏地进展，就必须保证矿产原料的供应能够及时地达到平衡。所谓及时，不仅是指一切重要工业建设技术设计所急需的矿产资料和其他地质资料应该立即由地质部门提出，而更重要的是这种资料的提供要比工业建设计划的制订还要走前一步。国家工业区合理分布计划的制订，在很大程度上决定于地质部门对新矿区的发现。因此，这样一个繁重的任务，就不是突击性的、短期的工作所能解决的，普查就应该是有高度计划性、预见性的长期工作。在国家计划经济发展过程中必须经常对普查工作作适当的部署，从这种长期性出发，普查工作本身的一切组织和设施，也应作长期打算。而且，这不仅仅是国家建设的要求，地质工作本身的特点也要求着必须作长远的考虑。因为每一个地区都有它特别的地质条件和其他特殊情况。参加普查工作的干部对这些条件和情况了解得越深刻，工作才能做得更好；而这一方面经验的累积也需要相当长的时间。因此，普查队一旦组织就绪，工作进展到一定的阶段，就不能以为告了一个段落而轻易解散，轻易撤销。
    第三，要明确普查是一个综合性的工作。根据国家当前和长远的建设事业对某种矿产的需要，根据某一地区特定的地质条件，我们在该区进行普查找矿工作时，可以把寻找一个矿种或几个矿种作为重点目标，这是完全正确的。但是我们却不能因此而对当地其他可能发现的、或已经遇到的矿种忽略不管。这不仅因为对预定矿种以外其他各项矿种的了解，常能帮助甚至加深我们对主要矿种分布规律的认识；也不仅是因为可以在工作中避免人力物力的浪费，发挥每次普查工作的效率；更重要的是因为对一个地区多项矿种的了解可以帮助我们正确地评定主要矿种的经济价值。例如在一个主要是铁矿的矿区中，有时铜矿和铁矿共生，这种铜矿就显然要影响铁矿的经济价值。
    不仅普查的对象应该是综合性的，就是普查的工作方法也不应该局限于填图、化验、钻探等直接的调查工作；而应该同时照顾到地层、构造、岩石等方面的理论研究。只有将研究工作和实地调查结合起来，我们才能更好地完成普查任务。因为各种矿产与其相应的地质情况互相伴随的规律对找矿常起着指导性的作用，我们只有不断地从实际问题的研究中掌握这些规律，才能更科学地更有系统地布置勘探工作。
      （三）
    今年的普查工作是在中央地质部的统一领导下与学校密切结合来进行的。学校方面参加普查的，单是今年的毕业生即有一千二百余人，因此，今年普查的目的不独要完成生产任务，同时也应该完成学校的生产实习要求。这样组织起来的普查找矿工作一定会增强和巩固生产部门与教育部门的联系。
    有人不免耽心：高等学校容易强调教学研究和生产实习，地质部门容易强调生产任务，两者组织在一起，是不是会闹矛盾。我们说，这个任务是统一一致的，只要大家对普查有正确全面的认识，不断改进领导和组织的方法，矛盾是可以克服的。何况组织在一起对两者都还有许多好处。就教师方面说，参加普查，就是参加生产实践。可以得到许多在学校范围内所不容易得到的东西。就生产部门的工作人员来说，无论工程师或职工，平时忙于任务，在一个荒僻的地区从事工作，很少有机会和外界接触，对问题的认识就受到一定的限制，趁这次组织起来的普查工作队的来到，就可以从广泛接触中，交流经验，得到提高。至于青年学生，当然更会从普查中获得更多的各方面的感性知识。
    可能也有人顾虑：学生还未受到全面的训练，要他们参加生产工作，恐怕达不到生产工作的要求，当然更难期望他们能有什么发现。这种想法，苏联的经验已经证明是保守的。现在在中国帮助我们工作的苏联地质专家中，有好几位在学生时代就参加过发现顿巴斯、库兹涅斯克那样巨大煤田的工作。毛泽东时代的青年学生是完全可以在这项工作中贡献他们的力量的。
      （四）
    由于普查工作队的人员来自各方，平日工作不同，经验不同，生活习惯不同，加强各方面人员的团结，应该成为各队的首要问题。各队负责干部、高级技术人员和学校教师必须在互相尊重、互相学习，在一切为了共同完成普查任务的基础上团结一致。只有各队负责干部团结成为一个有力的领导核心，明确分工，发挥集体领导力量，并发挥队内民主，才能团结全体队员，使全队成为一支有力的、自觉的、有组织的队伍。而这样的队伍才是我们胜利地完成普查任务最有力的保证。
    既然普查工作要在广大地区上进行，就很难想像，如果没有当地党委、政府和广大人民群众的支持，会把工作做得很好。所以，各个普查队应该争取当地党委和政府的指导和帮助，应该严守群众纪律，多向群众作普查的宣传解释工作，取得他们的帮助，特别是在少数民族地区，更应遵守民族政策，尊重少数民族的生活习惯。把群众关系搞好，不仅可减少工作中的许多困难，而且能取得群众积极主动的帮助。我国人民虽然还缺乏丰富的地质矿产知识，但他们对找矿工作是热情的，一年多来，地质部收到各地报矿信几千起，其中许多即可成为我们这次普查中找矿的线索。地质部在这次普查工作的决定中着重提出：各队对自己普查区内过去的群众报矿，应访问原报矿人，对报矿地点加以检查，并给予原报矿人以答复和鼓励。各队工作人员都应本着决定中向群众负责的精神，加强与当地群众的联系，取得群众的支持，只有这样，我们才有胜利地完成普查任务的更广大、更深厚的基础。
    伟大而光荣的普查任务落在我们的肩上。全体参加普查工作的同志们，希望你们在工作中发挥集体主义精神，克服困难，虚心学习，累积经验，预祝你们胜利地、全面地完成今年的普查任务！
