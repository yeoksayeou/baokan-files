    [By Our Correspondent] More than 70,000 New Agricultural Cooperatives Established Nationwide
    At the same time, it promoted the great development of mutual aid groups
    [This newspaper] According to statistics up to the end of March, agricultural producers' cooperatives have developed greatly across the country. More than 76,400 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established across the country, with more than 1,320,000 participating farm households. Together with the old cooperatives from last year, there are more than 91,000 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, with more than 1,660,000 participating farm households, accounting for 1.43 percent of the total number of farm households in the country. The land brought into the cooperatives totals more than 34.8 million mu, accounting for 2.16 percent of the total cultivated land area of the country. North China has developed the fastest, with more than 36,100 cooperatives established in the three months of spring alone. Together with the original cooperatives, there are now more than 41,800, with more than 779,000 participating farm households, accounting for 6.9 percent of the total number of farm households in the region, and the land brought into the cooperatives accounts for 6.28 percent of the cultivated land area in North China. In Northeast China, 4.38 percent of farm households and 5.42 percent of cultivated land have also joined cooperatives.
    This year, the development of the agricultural production cooperative movement in various regions is not only large in quantity, but also has a wide distribution. More than 70 percent of the townships in North China have cooperatives, and 795 administrative villages in the region are basically collectivized. In four counties in Shanxi Province, including Pingshun, more than 40 percent of farm households have joined cooperatives. In Northeast China, 36.4 percent of administrative villages have cooperatives, and 289 villages are basically collectivized. There are no blank counties in East China, more than 90 percent of districts have cooperatives, and 83 townships are basically collectivized. In Central South China, only ten counties in minority areas do not have cooperatives, and nearly half of the districts have cooperatives. One-fifth of the counties in Southwest China do not yet have cooperatives. In Northwest China, except for individual counties and some ethnic autonomous regions in agricultural areas, each county generally has one or two to four or five agricultural cooperatives. In the eastern region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, every district has cooperatives. In the western region, out of 198 districts, except for 49 districts without cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives have been established in all other districts.
    The mass development of agricultural production cooperatives this year has also yielded the following gains: First, it has educated the peasants, enabling the socialist consciousness of the vast number of peasants to take a step forward, and the worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated. Second, a large number of cooperative management cadres have been trained. In the Northwest region alone, more than 5,000 cadres for establishing cooperatives and backbone personnel for agricultural production cooperatives have been trained, including 2,500 working cadres. After training and practical experience in establishing cooperatives, these cadres will be an important force in promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future. Third, it has promoted the great development of mutual aid groups. According to statistics from 31 counties in four special districts of Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Dingxian, and Handan in Hebei Province, more than 40,000 new mutual aid groups have been developed. Although only 0.2 percent of farm households in Southwest China have joined cooperatives, the total number of organized farm households has reached 50 percent of the total number of farm households. In addition, in some areas where multiple ethnic groups live together, there are a considerable number of cooperatives and mutual aid groups jointly formed by two or more ethnic groups. These cooperatives and mutual aid groups, due to the implementation of ethnic policies and the strengthening of education on ethnic unity, have further promoted ethnic unity, eliminated barriers between ethnic groups, and achieved mutual respect, mutual learning, and common development of production on the basis of developing mutual aid and cooperation.

    全国新建农业合作社七万多个
    同时带动了互助组的大发展
    【本报讯】全国各地农业生产合作社已获得巨大发展。根据到三月底为止的统计，全国新建立的农业生产合作社已达七万六千四百多个，参加的农户有一百三十二万多户。加上去年原有的老社，全国共已有农业生产合作社九万一千多个，参加的农户有一百六十六万多户，占全国总农户数的百分之一点四三。入社的土地共有三千四百八十多万市亩，占全国总耕地面积百分之二点一六。其中华北区发展最快，在春季三个月中共建社三万六千一百多个，连原有社共已达四万一千八百多个，参加的农户有七十七万九千多户，占全区总农户数百分之六点九，入社土地占华北耕地面积百分之六点二八。东北区也有百分之四点三八的农户和百分之五点四二的耕地参加了合作社。
    今年各地建立农业生产合作社运动的发展，不仅是数量多，而且分布面广。华北区已有百分之七十以上的乡有社，全区并有七百九十五个行政村基本上合作化，山西省平顺等四个县入社的农户已占全县总农户百分之四十以上。东北区已有百分之三十六点四的行政村有社，基本上合作化的村有二百八十九个。华东区已没有空白县，百分之九十以上的区有社，基本上合作化的乡有八十三个。中南区只有少数民族地区的十个县没有社，近半数的区已有社。西南区还有五分之一的县没有社。西北区农业地区除个别县和某些民族自治区外，一般每县都有农业合作社一、两个到四、五个。内蒙自治区东部区已每区有社，西部地区一百九十八个区中，除四十九个区没有社外，其余各区都建立了农业生产合作社。
    今年大量发展农业生产合作社工作中，还有如下收获：首先教育了农民，使广大农民的社会主义觉悟提高了一步，工农联盟得到了进一步的巩固。其次培养了大批办社干部，仅西北区训练的建社干部和农业生产合作社的骨干就有五千多人，其中工作干部有两千五百人。这些干部经过训练和实际建社工作的锻炼后，将是今后推动互助合作运动的重要力量。再次是带动了互助组的大发展，河北省据天津、张家口、定县、邯郸四个专区三十一个县的统计，新发展的互助组就有四万多个。西南区参加合作社的农户虽然只有百分之零点二，但整个组织起来的农户已达到总农户百分之五十。此外，在一些民族杂居的地区，还有相当数量由两个或两个以上民族联合组成的合作社和互助组。这些合作社和互助组，由于贯彻了民族政策和加强了民族团结的教育，在发展互助合作的基础上，进一步促进了民族团结，消除了民族间的隔阂，达到相互尊重、相互学习和共同发展生产的要求。
