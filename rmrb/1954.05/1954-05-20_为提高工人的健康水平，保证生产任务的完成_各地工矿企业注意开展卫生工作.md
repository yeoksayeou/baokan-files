    Under the correct leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, significant achievements have been made in health work in factories and mines in our country, greatly changing the situation of lack of security for workers' lives, poor working environment, and frequent illnesses and industrial accidents in factories and mines under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.
    With the rapid development of national economic construction, the number of newly built and expanded industrial enterprises is increasing. In order to protect the health of workers, industrial departments have established a number of basic health organizations in industrial enterprises in recent years, and clinics or health centers have been established in many factories, mines, and construction sites. Some factories have also established workshop health stations, first-aid stations, and maternal and child health organizations. According to incomplete statistics from eleven industrial enterprises in 1953, 271 general hospitals have been established, with approximately 28,000 beds; 32 tuberculosis prevention and treatment centers, 1,799 clinics, 292 health stations, 5 health and epidemic prevention stations, 5 maternity hospitals, 177 maternal and child health stations, and 165 sanatoriums, with 13,942 beds. The establishment of these health institutions has played a certain role in improving workers' health, increasing attendance rates, and ensuring the smooth completion of production tasks.
    In order to improve the quality of health work in industrial enterprises, various regions have appropriately equipped themselves with health work cadres. Since 1952, a total of more than 3,100 graduates from higher medical colleges and secondary medical schools have been assigned to work in industrial enterprises (sporadic transfers are not included in this figure).
    Local health departments, in coordination with labor departments, industrial departments, and trade union systems, have also conducted large-scale safety and health inspections, which have promoted the improvement of safety and health equipment and environmental sanitation in factories and mines across the country, and reduced the incidence of industrial accidents and diseases. For example, in the spring 1950 safety and health inspection in Northeast China, according to incomplete statistics from 19 factories and mines including Anshan Iron and Steel, a total of more than 13,300 safety and health equipment items and more than 95,700 protective equipment items were added. Factories and mines in various regions have also paid attention to improving high temperatures, dust, humidity, and harmful gases in workshops and tunnels, and have added ventilation, dust prevention, and protection equipment. Factories, mines, and construction sites have also launched patriotic health campaigns, greatly improving the environmental sanitation of factories and mines, enriching workers' health knowledge, cultivating activists in health work, and directly reducing the incidence of diseases in industrial enterprises.
    In addition, on the basis of production development, general factories and mines have paid attention to workers' welfare facilities, such as building collective dormitories and residences, public canteens, bathrooms, lactation rooms, nurseries, female worker hygiene rooms, clubs, and sports grounds for employees, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the working masses.
    However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in industrial health work. Some health departments do not sufficiently recognize the significant importance of industrial hygiene during the period of national economic construction, resulting in industrial hygiene work lagging behind the development of the objective situation. Overlapping organizations, unclear leadership relationships, and serious phenomena of manpower dispersion and unclear responsibilities still exist. In addition, although common diseases, occupational diseases, and chronic diseases have been greatly reduced compared with the pre-liberation period, effective measures have not yet been taken to prevent and treat them in certain factories and mines in some areas. For example, 26 percent of the workers in the crushing workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Refractory Materials Factory suffer from silicosis. Sixty percent of the workers in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant suffer from loss of appetite and indigestion due to high heat. Benzene poisoning, lead poisoning, and acid poisoning in the chemical industry are generally still relatively serious. In general factories, workers also suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, rheumatic arthritis, hookworm disease, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, gynecological diseases, etc. These should be actively and gradually resolved in the future.

    为提高工人的健康水平，保证生产任务的完成
    各地工矿企业注意开展卫生工作
    在各级党委和各级人民政府的正确领导下，我国工厂、矿山中的卫生工作获得了显著的成绩，大大改变了国民党反动统治时期工矿企业中工人生活无保障、工作环境恶劣、疾病工伤事故多的情况。
    随着国家经济建设的迅速发展，新建扩建工业企业日益增多。为保护工人身体健康，各工业部门几年来在工业企业中，建立了若干卫生基层组织，厂矿工地多设立了门诊部或卫生所。有的工厂还建立了车间保健站、急救站、妇幼保健组织等。据一九五三年十一个工业企业的不完全统计，已经建立综合医院二百七十一所，约有病床两万八千张；结核病防治所三十二所，门诊部一千七百九十九个，保健站二百九十二个，卫生防疫站五个，产科医院五所，妇幼保健站一百七十七个，疗养院一百六十五所，病床一万三千九百四十二张。这些卫生机构的建立，对于提高工人的健康水平、提高出勤率，保证生产任务的顺利完成均起了一定的作用。
    为了提高工业企业中的卫生工作的质量，各地都适当地配备了卫生工作干部。从一九五二年起，分配到工业企业中工作的高等医学院校和中级医学校的毕业生，共有三千一百多人（零星调去的没有计算在内）。
    各地卫生部门，又配合劳动部门、工业部门、工会系统进行了安全卫生大检查，对全国工矿安全卫生设备、环境卫生的改进都起了推动作用，减低了工伤事故和疾病的发生率。例如，东北在一九五○年春季安全卫生大检查中，据鞍钢等十九个厂矿不完全统计，共计增设了安全卫生设备一万三千三百多件，防护设备九万五千七百多件。各地厂矿对车间、坑道的高温、粉尘、潮湿和有害气体也注意加以改进，增设了通风、防尘、防护等装备。各厂矿工地还开展了爱国卫生运动，大大改进了厂矿的环境卫生，丰富了工人的卫生知识，培养了卫生工作的积极分子，并直接减少了工业企业中的疾病发生率。
    此外，在生产发展的基础上，一般厂矿都注意了工人的福利设施，如为职工建筑集体宿舍和住宅、公共食堂、浴室、哺乳室、托儿所、女工卫生室和俱乐部、运动场等，大大鼓舞了工人群众的生产积极性。
    但在工业卫生工作中，目前仍然存在着不少的缺点和问题。某些卫生部门对工业卫生在国家经济建设时期的重大意义认识不足，致工业卫生工作落后于客观形势的发展。组织重叠，领导关系不明确；人力分散和职责不清的现象也还严重存在。此外，多发病、职业病、慢性病，目前虽已比解放前大为减少，但在某些地区的某些厂矿中仍未采取有效措施进行防治。如鞍钢耐火器材厂的粉碎车间还有百分之二十六的工人患矽肺。太原钢铁厂有百分之六十的工人因高热引起食欲不振和消化不良。化学工业中的苯中毒、铅中毒和酸中毒一般还较严重。在一般工厂中，工人肺结核病、风湿性关节炎、钩虫病、呼吸器病、肠胃病、妇科病等也还存在着。这些都应在今后积极地逐步求得解决。
