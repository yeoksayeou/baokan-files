    The Scale for Reasonably Solving Asian Problems
    Our correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
    In recent days, as the delegations of certain Western countries have used the opportunity of secret meetings to spread all kinds of atmosphere aimed at achieving their political purposes, the rumors and distortions surrounding the Geneva Conference, "optimism" and "pessimism," have been as volatile as the weather in Geneva.

    Since both topics of the Geneva Conference are Asian issues, what is the correct measure of the conference's success or failure? It is that the national independence, freedom, and reunification aspirations of the people of Korea and Indochina must be reasonably satisfied, as repeatedly pointed out by the delegations of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Because, as Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in a recent discussion on the Korean question: "The fundamental cause of the Asian problem is the colonialist aggression of imperialist countries in Asia and the Asian people's resistance to such aggression." If we do not fundamentally consider ending the long-unworkable colonialism and satisfying the national aspirations of the people of Korea and Indochina, then these two pressing Asian problems cannot be reasonably solved.

    As we have reported, the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference was stalled precisely because the American imperialists insisted on colonizing the whole of Korea and using it as a base for further launching wars of aggression. Regardless of the criticism of public opinion, the United States is putting pressure on the other fifteen countries participating in the Korean War to end the discussion of the Korean issue in failure. Various signs indicate that at the secret meetings that have substantively entered into the discussion of the Indochina issue according to existing agreements, French Foreign Minister Bidault, with the support of Washington, seems to want to return to the starting point of his adventurous journey at all times. The most prominent is to only talk about military ceasefire and avoid political issues; only talk about Vietnam and avoid Laos and Cambodia.

    Originally, according to the previously reached agreement, the foreign ministers were to discuss the eight-point proposal of Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Bidault's proposal. At the same time, it was agreed that both military and political issues should be discussed, with military issues taking priority. This certainly does not mean that a ceasefire can only be implemented after all political issues are resolved, but political issues must be discussed. Moreover, some political issues must be resolved first, otherwise a ceasefire cannot be implemented in practice. For example, in the course of the discussion, some representatives of Western countries stubbornly used Bao Dai and other three puppets as shields, refused to recognize the rights to national independence of the people of the three Indochinese countries, and in particular refused to recognize that there are national liberation movements, resistance governments, and armies fighting against French aggression in Laos and Cambodia. If these issues are not discussed and resolved, what is the basis for a ceasefire and the guarantee of consolidated peace? Isn't this tantamount to forcing the people of Indochina to give up the fruits of long-term bloodshed and sacrifice? For example, some Western delegations are unwilling to comprehensively, simultaneously, and quickly cease fire in Indochina, do not recognize the local armed forces of the Vietnamese people, and attempt to hand over the areas controlled by these people's armed forces to Bao Dai, and want to disarm the resistance armies of the people of Cambodia and Laos... etc. These are all political issues closely related to military issues, and if they cannot be resolved, there is naturally no way to talk about a ceasefire. The meaning of not wanting to face these realistic problems is none other than clinging to the old colonialism and not wanting to fundamentally consider satisfying the national rights of the people of Indochina.

    It is worth noting that, while the conference is going on, Western, especially some French and American bourgeois newspapers, continue to spread bizarre myths such as "the expansion of Asian communism" and "Communist China advocates an Asian Monroe Doctrine," in an attempt to distort the significance of the national liberation movements of the Asian countries.

    As early as the plenary session on the Korean issue on April 29, Foreign Minister Molotov sharply refuted the so-called myth of "the expansion of communism." Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out: "These people attribute all movements of oppressed peoples to strive for freedom and national independence to communism, and in doing so, they violate their own will and enhance the prestige of the Communists—even in matters that have nothing to do with the Communists. They did not consider that the self-sacrificing struggle of people with different political views and beliefs for national freedom and independence is actually promoted by their desire to liberate themselves from foreign rule and from colonial shackles."

    The so-called People's Republic of China advocates the "Asian Monroe Doctrine" is an even more vicious but superficial lie. It is true that, as Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said: The People's Republic of China is enthusiastically sympathetic and supportive of the national independence movements of the people of Asian countries, and the Chinese people hope that Asian countries will work together to maintain peace and collective security in Asia; "Asian countries should consult with each other and work together to maintain peace and security in Asia by assuming corresponding obligations." If opposing aggression and seeking collective security in Asia is "Monroe Doctrine," then this "Monroe Doctrine" is not only prevalent in Asia, but has long spread all over the world.

    The foreign policy of the People's Republic of China has nothing in common with the so-called "Monroe Doctrine." The People's Republic of China is willing to establish regular diplomatic relations with all countries in the world on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

    For many years, the masters of many Asian countries have been foreigners. Asian people have been deprived of the right to decide the fate of their own countries, and all Asian problems have depended on Western "politicians." This phenomenon was once considered normal by the colonialists, but today it is gone forever. Many Western bourgeois figures have gradually realized the tremendous changes taking place in Asia and have begun to recognize that the will of the Asian people must be respected in solving Asian problems in the future. The West German "Aachen News" wrote: "Without the Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of this new regime expressing his opinion in Geneva, the fate of Asia cannot be decided"; "The voice from the Chinese in Geneva is not the dissemination of communist ideas, but a clear goal representative of a country's ruling policy and security policy, and it is not unworthy as the spokesperson for many Asian countries trampled by European colonialism."

    In fact, the Western colonialists are not unaware of this tremendous and fundamental change taking place in Asia, but they are unwilling to face reality and give up. People remember that after Eisenhower came to power, he determined the policy of "Asians fighting Asians." Since then, American colonialists have desperately pieced together aggressive blocs, planning to provide guns and money, while Asians fight and sell their lives, in order to save the precarious colonial rule in Asia. This policy, on the one hand, shows that the colonialists are as vicious as wolves, and on the other hand, it shows their fragility. Apart from those few who are willing to sell themselves to Li Chengman, Chiang Kai-shek, Bao Dai, and others, how many people can they rely on?

    The people of Asia have awakened. It is doomed to failure to go against the torrent of history, adopt threats and intimidation, and conspire to interfere in the affairs of the people of Indochina and expand the war in the name of the United Nations as in the Korean issue. As the Paris "Liberation" said on the 26th: "France cannot prevent the people of Laos and Cambodia from establishing their own republics under their own volition, just as it cannot use force to rearrange an emperor in Vietnam." Whether on the Korean issue or on the Indochina issue, the correct measure for a reasonable solution is to satisfy the national independence, freedom, and reunification aspirations of the Asian people.

### 合理解决亚洲问题的尺度

    合理解决亚洲问题的尺度
    本报记者　吴文焘　李庄
    这些天里，由于某些西方国家的代表团利用秘密会议的机会来散布种种旨在达到它们的政治目的的空气，以致围绕着日内瓦会议的谣传和曲解，“乐观”和“悲观”，正像日内瓦的天气那样变幻无常。
    既然日内瓦会议的两个主题都是亚洲问题，那么什么是衡量会议成败的正确尺度呢？那就是：中华人民共和国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国代表团所一再指出的，必须合理地满足朝鲜和印度支那人民的民族独立、自由与统一的意愿。因为，正如周恩来外长在最近一次朝鲜问题讨论中所说的：“亚洲问题发生的根本原因，是帝国主义国家在亚洲的殖民主义侵略和亚洲人民对这种侵略的反抗。”如果不从根本上考虑结束早已行不通的殖民主义，而满足朝鲜和印度支那人民的民族愿望，那就不能合理地解决这两个亚洲的迫切问题。
    我们已经报道过，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，正是因为美帝国主义者坚持要将全朝鲜殖民地化并作为进一步发动侵略战争的基地，而被搁浅。不管舆论的非难，美国正向其他十五个参加侵朝的国家施加压力，以便使朝鲜问题的讨论以失败而终止。种种迹象表明，在根据已有的协议进入印度支那问题的实质讨论的秘密会议上，法国外交部长皮杜尔在华盛顿方面的支持下，似乎时时想回到他冒险旅行的出发点去。最突出的就是，只谈军事停火而回避政治问题；只谈越南问题而回避寮国和高棉问题。
    本来，按照前此所达到的协议，外长们要就越南民主共和国首席代表范文同副总理兼代理外长的八点建议和皮杜尔的建议来进行讨论，同时协议军事和政治问题都要讨论，军事问题优先讨论。这当然并不是说，所有的政治问题都解决了才实行停火，但是政治问题是必须要谈的。而且有些政治问题不先解决，实际上是无法实行停火的。例如在讨论过程中，有些西方国家的代表就一意孤行地拿出保大等三个傀儡来作挡箭牌，拒绝承认印度支那三国人民的民族独立的权利，特别是拒绝承认在寮国和高棉同样有民族解放运动，有抵抗法国侵略的抗战政府和军队。如果这些问题不谈，不求得解决，那有什么停火的基础与巩固和平的保证呢？这不是等于强令印度支那人民把长期流血牺牲的果实付诸流水吗？又例如，有些西方国家的代表团不愿全面同时和迅速地在印度支那停火，不承认越南人民的地方武装，妄图将这些人民武装所控制的地区交给保大，要把高棉和寮国人民的抗战军队解除武装……等等，这些都是与军事问题密切有关的政治问题，如果不能得到解决，自然是谈不到停火的。不愿面对这些现实问题的含义不是别的，正是留恋着老的殖民主义，而不愿从根本上考虑满足印度支那人民的民族权利。
    值得注意的是，与会议进行的同时，西方特别是一些美法资产阶级报纸继续散布着“亚洲共产主义的扩张”、“共产党中国主张亚洲门罗主义”等等怪诞不经的神话，妄图歪曲亚洲各国人民民族解放运动的意义。
    早在四月二十九日讨论朝鲜问题的全体会议上，莫洛托夫外长就一针见血地驳斥了所谓“共产主义的扩张”的神话。莫洛托夫外长指出：“这些人把一切被压迫人民争取自由与民族独立的运动都归因于共产主义，这样他们就反而违反了他们自己的意志，而提高了共产党人的威望——甚至是在与共产党人毫无关系的问题上。他们没有考虑到：具有不同政治见解与信仰的人民的争取民族自由与独立的自我牺牲的斗争，实际上是由他们要求自外国统治下解放、自殖民桎梏下解放的宿愿来促进的。”
    所谓中华人民共和国主张“亚洲门罗主义”，更是一种恶毒的但是浅薄的谎话。不错，正如周恩来外长所说的：中华人民共和国对亚洲各国人民的民族独立运动是热烈同情和尽力支持的，中国人民希望亚洲国家共同努力维护亚洲的和平和集体安全；“亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全”。如果说反对侵略、谋求亚洲的集体安全就是
  “门罗主义”，那么这种“门罗主义”就不仅盛行于亚洲，而且早已走遍了全世界。
    中华人民共和国的对外政策与所谓“门罗主义”毫无共同之点。中华人民共和国愿意和世界上所有国家在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则下建立经常的外交关系。
    多少年来亚洲许多国家的主人都是外国人，亚洲人民被剥夺了决定本国命运的权利，亚洲的一切问题都取决于西方的“政治家”。这种现象曾经被殖民主义者们认为是正常的，但在今天它已经一去不复返了。不少西方资产阶级的人士也逐渐认识到亚洲发生的巨大变化，开始承认今后解决亚洲问题时必须尊重亚洲人民的意志。西德“亚琛新闻”报写道：“在日内瓦没有这位新政权的总理兼外长周恩来表示他的意见，就不能决定亚洲的命运”；
  “中国人在日内瓦所发出的声音，不是宣传散布共产主义思想，而是一个国家的当权政策与安全政策的明确目标的代表，作为受欧洲殖民主义践踏的很多亚洲国家的发言人并不是不配称的”。
    其实对于亚洲发生的这种巨大的根本性的变化，西方的殖民主义者也并非没有感觉到，只是他们不愿面对现实地善罢干休。人们记得艾森豪威尔上台以后就确定了“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，此后美国殖民主义者即拚命拼凑侵略集团，打算由它出枪出钱，而由亚洲人打仗卖命，借以挽救在亚洲的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。这种政策，一方面说明了殖民主义者是狼一样的狠毒，另方面也显示出它们的脆弱。除了那些少而又少的甘心卖身投靠的李承晚、蒋介石、保大之流外，他们还有多少人可以依靠呢？
    亚洲人民已经觉醒了。违背历史的巨流，采取威胁恫吓，阴谋像朝鲜问题那样假借联合国的名义来干涉印度支那人民的事务和扩大战争，都是注定要失败的。正如二十六日巴黎“解放报”所说的： “法国的不能阻止寮国和高棉人民在其自愿之下成立自己的共和国，正和它不能用武力在越南重新安排一个皇帝一样。”不论在朝鲜问题或是在印度支那问题上，合理解决的正确尺度，就是满足亚洲人民的民族独立自由和统一的愿望。五月二十七日
