To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

    The article "Guo Xing, People's Inspector Correspondent of the Ministry of Railways, Puts Forward Rational Proposals, Saving the State More Than 480 Billion Yuan in Construction Funds," published on the first page of the People's Daily on May 15th, was reported by us. After publication, we re-checked it and found it to be inconsistent with the facts. Although Comrade Guo Xing made such a suggestion, the leadership had repeatedly studied this issue before Guo Xing made the suggestion, and re-studied it after Guo Xing made the suggestion, believing that changing the original design was unjustified and inappropriate. Therefore, this report is inconsistent with the facts. The reason for the factual error in the report is that the person in charge did not carefully check the facts, and the reviewer did not carefully review it, failing to contact the competent department or consult the leaders of our committee before issuing it. This error was caused by our sloppy and irresponsible work, and is currently under investigation and being dealt with.

    来信更正人民日报编辑部：
    五月十五日人民日报第一版所登“铁道部人民监察通讯员郭星提出合理建议，为国家节约了建设资金四千八百多亿元”一稿，是我们报道的，发表后我们重新作了核对，发现与事实不符。郭星同志虽有这种建议，但领导上在郭星未提建议之前，即曾多次研究此问题，在郭星提出建议之后又重新作了研究，认为改变原设计，理由不充分，是不适当的，因此这一报道，是与事实不符的。报道失实的原因，是由于主办人员没有仔细查对事实，而审稿人未认真审核，既没与主管部门联系，又未请示本委领导人即发出。这个错误是由于我们工作上粗枝大叶不负责任所造成，现正在检查与处理中。
