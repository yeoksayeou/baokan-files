The first National Industrial Hygiene Conference, convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, opened in the capital on the 18th.

This conference was convened in accordance with the spirit of the decision to strengthen industrial hygiene work in the Third National Health Administration Conference resolution. The conference will discuss how health work can serve the overall task of the country during the transition period and the country's socialist industrialization. Concrete steps and methods for carrying out industrial hygiene work will also be discussed and decided upon.

More than 200 people attended the conference, including representatives from relevant departments of the Central People's Government, heads of health bureaus and departments of major administrative regions, provinces and cities, leading cadres in industrial hygiene work, representatives from relevant organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Red Cross Society of China, and the Chinese Medical Association, labor hygiene researchers from the Central Institute of Health and some higher medical colleges, and heads of some major industrial and mining hospitals and industrial and mining health institutions.

He Cheng, Vice Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that the convening of this conference is timely and necessary, and it focuses on discussing industrial hygiene issues, which is a first in our country's history. After briefly explaining the central tasks of this conference, Vice Minister He Cheng called on everyone to hold this conference well in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, to create good conditions for future industrial hygiene work, to bring health to the broad masses of workers, and to bring abundant human resources to the country's economic construction. He said: During the period when the Chinese people are realizing the country's socialist industrialization, increasing labor productivity is of great significance to our country's construction cause, and ensuring the physical health of the masses of workers is one of the indispensable factors for increasing labor productivity and completing the country's socialist industrialization. Health workers' struggle for the health of workers is a struggle to improve labor productivity, which is also a struggle for the country's socialist industrialization. He called on health workers to actively shoulder this glorious and great task and truly become active builders of socialism.

Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health, delivered a report at the conference entitled "Actively Carry Out Industrial Hygiene Work, Enhance Workers' Physical Health, and Serve the Country's Economic Construction." After describing the achievements of industrial hygiene work in the past few years since the founding of New China and the main shortcomings and problems currently existing, he put forward several main tasks in the current industrial hygiene work: gradually implement the industrial hygiene area responsibility system, carry out patriotic health campaigns, actively prevent and control common and occupational diseases, establish industrial hygiene organizations, and gradually carry out national health supervision, etc., and asked the representatives to discuss them. In his report, he also proposed that the conference formulate specific guidelines and tasks for industrial hygiene. Vice Minister Xu Yunbei particularly emphasized the issue of strengthening political and ideological leadership in industrial hygiene work. He said: All health personnel must strive to improve their socialist ideological consciousness and strengthen their political responsibility to serve the overall task of the country during the transition period and to serve the country's economic construction. At the same time, industrial hygiene must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party; it must face production and serve production; it must implement the policy of prevention first, rely on workers, and be carried out on the basis of widely mobilizing workers. He finally pointed out that to carry out industrial hygiene work, we must overcome bureaucracy. Leading cadres should take the lead and start with key tasks and extend them to general tasks. He pointed out that industrial hygiene work is a new work, and everyone must make the greatest determination and the greatest effort to do the work well.

On the afternoon of the 18th, the conference invited Soviet expert Comrade Bauldelev to give a report on the situation and experience of industrial hygiene work in the Soviet Union. On the morning of the 19th, Comrade Liu Zikui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was invited to give a report on labor protection issues. From the afternoon of the 19th, the conference began to hold group discussions on the above reports and conference documents.
