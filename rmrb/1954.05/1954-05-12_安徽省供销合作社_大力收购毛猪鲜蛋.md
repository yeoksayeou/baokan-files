    Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Vigorously Purchases Hogs and Fresh Eggs
    The Anhui Provincial Cooperative General Office signed an agreement with the Anhui Provincial Company of the China Food Company in early March for the agency purchase of hogs and fresh eggs. According to incomplete statistics as of April 21, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province purchased more than 9.8 million catties of fresh eggs and more than 165,000 hogs.

    In the process of purchasing hogs and fresh eggs, the cooperatives in various parts of Anhui correctly implemented the state's price policy, enabling farmers to avoid being exploited by unscrupulous merchants who depress prices. To facilitate farmers' sales of hogs and fresh eggs, some cooperatives have set up additional purchasing points. The Fengyang County Cooperative Union also adopted the method of "exchanging eggs for salt" for purchases, based on the farmers' past custom of "exchanging eggs for salt." Cooperatives in Wuhu, Fuyang, Chuxian and other places, in coordination with the work of purchasing hogs and fresh eggs, supplied farmers with a large amount of feed, solving the difficulty of farmers lacking pig feed.

    安徽省供销合作社
    大力收购毛猪鲜蛋
    安徽省合作总社在三月上旬和中国食品公司安徽省公司签订了毛猪、鲜蛋代购协议。截至四月二十一日止的不完全统计，全省各地供销社共收购鲜蛋九百八十余万斤，收购毛猪十六万五千多头。
    安徽各地合作社在收购毛猪和鲜蛋时，正确地贯彻了国家的价格政策，使农民避免遭受奸商压价收购的剥削。为了便利农民出售毛猪、鲜蛋，有些合作社增设了收购点。凤阳县合作社联合社还根据农民过去“用蛋换盐”的习惯，采取了“鸡蛋换盐”的收购方式。芜湖、阜阳、滁县等地的合作社，配合收购毛猪、鲜蛋工作，供应了农民大批饲料，解决了农民缺乏喂猪饲料的困难。
