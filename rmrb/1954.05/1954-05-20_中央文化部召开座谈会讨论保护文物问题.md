Before the opening of the "Exhibition of Unearthed Cultural Relics in National Basic Construction Projects," the Central Ministry of Culture held a symposium on May 17 to discuss the issue of clearing and protecting historical relics in basic construction. Participants included Wang Shao'ao, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Finance; Li Fanyi, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; and representatives from various industrial construction departments. Also participating were scholars in history, archeology, architecture, and art sculpture, including Jian Bozan, Xiang Da, Liu Danian, Yin Da, Liang Sicheng, and Liu Kaiqu, totaling more than seventy people.

At the symposium, Zheng Zhenduo, Director of the Bureau of Social Culture of the Ministry of Culture, pointed out the achievements in protecting cultural relics in coordination with basic construction in the past three to four years, and emphasized the importance of cooperation between engineering construction departments and cultural departments in protecting cultural relics. For example, on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, cultural relic excavation teams worked together with engineering teams; the organization of cultural relic excavation at the Baisha Reservoir also closely cooperated with the water conservancy department, so that underground buried cultural relics could be excavated and protected from loss. He requested that engineering construction departments further strengthen close cooperation with cultural departments in the future. Historians Jian Bozan, Xiang Da, and others believed that the large number of cultural relics unearthed in basic construction projects greatly helped their historical research work, providing material examples of certain historical facts of ancient times. Architect Liang Sicheng said that when carrying out architectural design, the work of protecting cultural relics should be organized into urban construction plans. Sculptor Liu Kaiqu believed that ancient cultural relics with high artistic value provide sculptors with many valuable materials. Li Fanyi, Deputy Minister of the Fuel Industry, and Deputy Mayor Wu Han both expressed that they would further strengthen contact with cultural departments in the future and educate construction engineering personnel to pay attention to the protection of cultural relics. Speakers also believed that ancient cultural relics are the property of all the people, and archaeological personnel must be organized to conduct serious research, and widely carry out exhibitions and publicity to arouse the attention of the people of the whole country to the protection of cultural relics.

    中央文化部召开座谈会讨论保护文物问题
    在“全国基本建设工程中出土文物展览会”开幕以前，中央文化部于五月十七日召开了座谈会，讨论基本建设中清理保护历史文物的问题。参加座谈会的有中央财政部副部长王绍鏊、中央燃料工业部副部长李范一，北京市副市长吴晗，以及各工业建设部门的代表；参加座谈的还有历史、考古、建筑、美术雕刻方面的学者翦伯赞、向达、刘大年、尹达、梁思成、刘开渠等共七十多人。
    在座谈会上，文化部社会文化事业管理局局长郑振铎指出最近三、四年来配合基本建设保护文物的成绩，并强调指出了工程建筑部门和文化部门合作，在保护文物上的重要性。如在成渝路上和天兰路上，文物发掘队和工程队一起进行工作；在白沙水库文物发掘的组织也和水利部门密切配合，所以都能把地下埋藏的文物发掘出来，使之不受损失。他要求工程建筑部门今后和文化部门更加取得密切配合。历史学家翦伯赞、向达等都认为，在基本建设工程中文物的大量被发掘，对他们的历史研究工作有很大帮助，使古代的某些历史事实得到了物质的例证。建筑学家梁思成说，在进行建筑设计时，应该把保护文物的工作组织到都市建筑计划里来。雕刻家刘开渠认为，具有高度艺术价值的古代文物对雕刻家提供了许多宝贵资料。燃料工业部副部长李范一和吴晗副市长，都表示今后要更进一步和文化部门取得联系，教育建筑工程人员注意保护文物。发言者并都认为，古代文物是全体人民的财产，必须组织考古人员进行认真的研究，并广泛进行展览和宣传，以引起全国人民对于保护文物的重视。
