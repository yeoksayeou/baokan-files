Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 7th – After a two-day recess, the Geneva Conference continued its general debate on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question at 3 PM on the 7th. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov chaired the meeting.

The first to speak was Filipino representative Garcia. Observers here believed before Garcia's speech that he would not go beyond the scope outlined for him by Dulles. As expected, Garcia did not offer anything new, merely repeating what Dulles had said nine days earlier, like a parrot. He opposed the Korean people resolving the Korean question themselves and advocated for the "unification" of Korea by the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties. Garcia opposed Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal. However, he could not offer any "reason" that could be called a reason, other than saying that the proposal did not comply with the illegal resolutions of the United Nations.

Garcia attempted to erase the Asian people's desire for peace and freedom reflected in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech on April 28th. According to him, the Thai representative's speech represented the voice of Asia. However, everyone knows that the "open door, equal opportunity" policy advocated by the Thai representative represents the interests of imperialist countries and has long been rejected by the Asian people.

Garcia praised how the United States bestowed "independence" on the Philippines. However, he completely dared not mention the fact that US military bases are all over the Philippines and have expanded from twenty-three to thirty-five, nor did he dare to mention that the Philippine economy has become a dependency of the United States, and the United States' blatant interference in Philippine internal affairs. Garcia even said that the United States' seizure of the Philippines from Spain in the nineteenth century and its possession of it was the beginning of the "liberation" of the Philippines and Asia. He even described the new colonial empire—the United States' aggressive activities in Asia, which replaced the old colonialists and aimed to enslave the Asian people—as "the United States ended colonialism in Asia."

New Zealand representative Webb spoke next. Webb acknowledged that the final resolution of the Korean question is important and urgent for the Korean people and for the peace of East Asia and the world. He believed that there should be a spirit of compromise and moderation at the conference, and a rigid and uncompromising attitude should not be adopted. However, he avoided talking about the US and South Korean representatives' stubborn refusal to negotiate and instead criticized the factual speeches of the Chinese and Korean representatives. He tried his best to defend the United States' aggressive behavior in Asia, insisting that the United States' aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations was a so-called "police action" taken by the United Nations for "collective security." Although the United Nations, under the coercion of the United States, has become one of the belligerents in Korea, he still believes it is an impartial organization. He admitted that New Zealand had suffered great losses that New Zealand could not bear due to following the United States to interfere in Korea. However, he tried to make it seem as if this was not for the benefit of the United States, although he did not dare to say it was for the benefit of the New Zealand people.

Webb believed that free elections are necessary to resolve the Korean question. The proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should not be rejected immediately, but should be carefully studied. But then he opposed equal representation of North and South Korea in the All-Korean Committee, saying that it would be impossible to hope for an agreement, and therefore it was unrealistic. This so-called "reason" is obviously unfounded. The experience of the Korean armistice negotiations proves that the warring parties in Korea can reach an agreement on an equal footing on the issue of the armistice. Why can't an agreement be reached on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea on the same basis? Webb admitted that all countries that followed the United States to interfere in Korea hoped to withdraw their troops from Korea, but he opposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops in Korea within six months. The questions he raised indicated that he disagreed with withdrawing US troops from Korea before the elections were held. He groundlessly slandered the Korean-Chinese side for violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and, based on this non-existent fabrication, demanded the organization of a group to supervise the withdrawal of troops. This group would be able to freely enter and exit all parts of Korea to conduct so-called "inspections." He insisted that the Korean elections should be supervised by a so-called "impartial international body," and this body would be the "United Nations," one of the belligerent parties.

Webb concluded by saying, "We all recognize China and the Soviet Union's need for security. Korea is an explosive region. Korea's neighbors, like Korea itself, need guarantees." He hoped that the conference could achieve a solution that meets the legitimate demands of all relevant countries, especially the entire Korean people.

Colombian representative Angel spoke next. Angel attempted to restore the United States' morally unfavorable position and put forward a five-point proposal for resolving the Korean question. However, this proposal did not include anything new. According to his proposal, the Korean elections should be held under the auspices of the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties, and the UN forces should only be withdrawn after the elections are held. In this way, Angel once again advocated holding elections under foreign interference and under the occupation of foreign troops, to achieve the goal of extending the Syngman Rhee regime to North Korea.

Angel used lengthy rhetoric to clamor for maintaining the "authority" of the United Nations, and he hypocritically demanded respect for the UN Charter. However, everyone knows that it was precisely because the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations that the UN Charter and authority were severely damaged, and the United Nations was transformed from an organization for maintaining peace and security into a tool to cover up US aggression on the Korean question and related issues. It is precisely because of this that the United Nations has lost its qualifications to fairly handle the Korean question.

In his speech, Angel specifically attacked the provision in Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal that the All-Korean Committee must make decisions by mutual agreement. Angel attempted to use Dulles' "proportional representation" method to enable the Syngman Rhee group to control this committee in order to expand the Syngman Rhee regime to North Korea. Angel also talked about the Pan-American Union controlled by the United States. According to him, because Latin American countries do not have veto power in this alliance, it is an example of "democracy." However, everyone knows that it is precisely this so-called "democracy" of the Pan-American Union that makes Latin American countries submit to the colonial policies of the United States.

After the Colombian representative spoke, no one else signed up to speak. The chairman announced that a meeting to discuss the Indochina issue might be held tomorrow. Therefore, the general debate on the Korean question may not be held. A decision may be made tonight or tomorrow morning.

The meeting adjourned at 5 PM. (Attached image)

### 日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题

    日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】经过两天的休会之后，日内瓦会议于七日下午三时继续进行关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一般辩论。苏联外长莫洛托夫担任会议主席。
    第一个发言的是菲律宾代表加西亚。在加西亚发言之前，这里的观察家就认为他绝不会超出杜勒斯给他划定的范围。果然不出所料，加西亚除了像鹦鹉学舌一样地把杜勒斯在九天前所说过的话重说一遍以外，没有任何新内容。他反对由朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题，主张由交战一方的联合国来“统一”朝鲜。加西亚反对南日外务相的建议。但是他除了说这个建议不合乎联合国的非法决议以外，提不出任何可以称之为理由的“理由”。
    加西亚企图抹煞周恩来外长在四月二十八日的发言中所反映的亚洲人民要求和平与自由的愿望。据他看来，泰国代表的发言倒是代表亚洲的声音，然而，大家知道，泰国代表所主张的“门户开放、机会均等”政策代表着帝国主义国家的利益，并早已遭到亚洲人民的唾弃。
    加西亚赞扬美国如何赐给菲律宾以“独立”，然而他却完全不敢提到美国的军事基地遍布菲律宾各地并已从二十三处扩充到三十五处的事实，也不敢提到菲律宾经济已成为美国的附庸，和美国对菲律宾内政的露骨的干涉。加西亚竟然说，美国在十九世纪把菲律宾从西班牙手中夺过来据为己有，乃是菲律宾和亚洲“解放”的开始。他甚至把新的殖民帝国——美国在亚洲推行的取旧的殖民者而代之的旨在奴役亚洲人民的种种侵略活动，说成是“美国结束了亚洲的殖民主义”。
    新西兰代表韦伯接着发言。韦伯承认朝鲜问题的最后解决对于朝鲜人民和东亚以至世界的和平都是重要而且迫切的。他认为在会议上应该有妥协和温和的精神，不应采取僵硬不妥协的态度。但是他对于美国和南朝鲜代表固执地拒绝协商的态度避而不谈，却反而对中、朝两国代表的合乎事实的发言大加指责。他竭力为美国在亚洲的侵略行为辩护，把美国假联合国之名对朝鲜的侵略，硬说成是联合国为“集体安全”而采取的所谓“警察行动”。虽然联合国在美国挟持之下成了在朝鲜交战的一方，但他仍然认为它是公正的机构。他承认新西兰由于追随美国干涉朝鲜，受到了不是新西兰所能承担的很大的损失，但他却企图把事情说得好像这并不是为了美国的利益，虽然他也不敢说这是为了新西兰人民的利益。
    韦伯认为，自由选举是解决朝鲜问题所必需的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日提出的建议不应该立即加以拒绝，而应加以慎重的研究。但是接着他又反对在全朝鲜委员会中南北朝鲜有同等的代表权，据他说这样就不可能希望达成协议，因而这是不切实际的。这种所谓“理由”显然是没有根据的。朝鲜停战谈判的经验证明：在停战的问题上朝鲜交战双方尚且可以在平等的基础上达成协议，为什么朝鲜和平统一的问题就不能在同样的基础上取得协议？韦伯承认追随美国干涉朝鲜的各国都希望从朝鲜撤退他们的军队，但他又反对在六个月之内撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队。他提出的问题表明他不同意在举行选举以前就从朝鲜撤退美国军队。他毫无根据地诬蔑朝中方面破坏朝鲜停战协定，并且以这种根本不存在的捏造为根据，要求组织一种小组来监督撤军，这种小组并得在全朝鲜各地自由出入进行所谓“视察”。他坚持朝鲜的选举应该由一个所谓“公正的国际团体”来监督，而这个团体就是交战一方的“联合国”。
      韦伯最后说，“我们全都承认中国和苏联对于安全的需要。朝鲜是一个爆炸性的地区。朝鲜的邻国，像朝鲜本身一样，都需要保证。”他希望会议能获致一种符合于一切有关国家的、特别是全朝鲜人民的合法要求的解决办法。
    哥伦比亚代表安赫尔接着发言。安赫尔企图替美国挽回道义上的不利地位，提出了一个解决朝鲜问题的五点主张。然而，这个主张并没有包括什么新的东西。根据他的主张，朝鲜的选举要在交战一方的联合国主持之下举行，联合国军要在选举举行之后才能撤退。这样，安赫尔就再次主张在外力干涉之下及在外国军队占领之下举行选举，以达到把李承晚政权扩展到北朝鲜的目的。
    安赫尔用了冗长的言辞叫嚣维护联合国的“权威”，他伪善地要求尊重联合国宪章。然而，大家知道，正是由于美国利用联合国的名义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，联合国的宪章和权威才受到了严重的破坏，联合国才在朝鲜问题上及与此有关的问题上从一个维护和平与安全的机构变成了一个掩饰美国侵略的工具。也正因为如此，联合国才失去了公平处理朝鲜问题的资格。
    安赫尔在发言中特别攻击南日外务相建议中全朝鲜委员会必须由双方协议作出决定的规定。安赫尔企图用杜勒斯的“比例代表制”的办法来使李承晚集团得以控制这个委员会，以便把李承晚政权扩大到北朝鲜。安赫尔还谈到美国操纵下的泛美联盟。据他说，因为在这个联盟里，拉丁美洲国家没有否决权，因而它是“民主”的范例。然而，谁都知道，正是泛美联盟的这种所谓“民主”，使拉丁美洲各国屈从于美国的殖民政策。
    在哥伦比亚代表发言之后，没有其他人报名发言。主席宣布：明天可能举行讨论印度支那问题的会议。因而，可能不举行关于朝鲜问题的一般辩论。大概今天晚上或明天上午可以作出决定。
    会议于下午五时休会。（附图片）
