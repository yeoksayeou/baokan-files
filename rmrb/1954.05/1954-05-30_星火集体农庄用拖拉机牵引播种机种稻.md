The famous Spark Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, used a tractor-pulled seed drill for the first time this spring to plant rice using the dry direct seeding method (seeding before flooding). The quality of the seeding was very good. One small tractor pulling a twenty-four row seed drill can sow twenty-five hectares in one working day, which is equivalent to the efficiency of one hundred and twenty-five farmers using dibblers, or eight horse-drawn seed drills. As a result, more than fifteen thousand workdays can be saved during this year's spring planting and invested in animal husbandry, land planning, and basic construction of the farm. This farm plans to use agricultural machinery to sow one hundred and fifty hectares (fifteen mu per hectare) of rice this year, accounting for 37.5% of all paddy fields. The remaining arable land will be sown with horse-drawn farm implements. Machine sowing can increase production by about 10% compared to old cultivation methods. Coupled with other yield-increasing measures, this will guarantee the farm's production of 4.22 million jin of rice this year.

Some farmers in the rice-producing areas of Songjiang Province believe that using dibblers and row seeders to sow rice is already a great progress, and that mechanization of paddy field cultivation is not possible. Even some older members of the farm and new members who joined this year believe that tractors are only suitable for sowing dry land crops, and they are not confident in sowing rice. Therefore, many human-pulled seed drills were prepared during sowing in case the tractor broke down. However, under the guidance of the Huachuan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station, the quality of dry direct seeding with tractors was very good. The human-pulled seed drills, one of the main sowing tools last year, can only find some odd jobs on the headlands and field edges this year. After visiting the site, farmers in nearby villages who did not believe that paddy field cultivation could be mechanized also actively requested the Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station to cultivate their land for them.

### 星火集体农庄用拖拉机牵引播种机种稻

    星火集体农庄用拖拉机牵引播种机种稻
    著名的松江省桦川县星火集体农庄，今年春耕播种中第一次用拖拉机牵引播种机采用旱直播（放水前播种）的办法播种水稻，播种的质量很好。一台小型拖拉机牵引二十四行播种机，一个工作日就播种二十五垧，能顶上一百二十五名使用点播机的农民，或八台马拉播种机的效能。因此，在今年春耕播种过程中，能节省出一万五千多个工作日投入畜牧业、土地规划和农庄基本建设上去。这个农庄今年计划用农业机器播种一百五十垧（每垧十五市亩）水稻，占全部水田百分之三十七点五，其余耕地由马拉农具播种。机器播种能比旧耕作法增产百分之十左右，再加上其他增产措施，将保证农庄今年生产四百二十二万斤稻谷。
    松江省水稻产区有些农民认为现在使用点播机和条播机播种水稻就算很进步了，水田耕作不能实行机械化。就连农庄里一些年老庄员和今年新入庄的庄员，也认为拖拉机只适于播种旱田作物，播种水稻没有把握。因此，在播种时还准备了很多台人拉播种机，准备在拖拉机发生故障时使用。但在国营桦川农业机器拖拉机站的指导下，用拖拉机旱直播的播种质量很好。去年播种时主要播种工具之一的人拉播种机，今年只能在地头地边上找些零活做了。附近村庄不相信水田耕作可以机械化的农民，经过实地参观后，也积极要求农业机器拖拉机站给他们耕作。（新华社）
