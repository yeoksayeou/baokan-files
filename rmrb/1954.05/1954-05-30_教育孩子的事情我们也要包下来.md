A message to soldiers from a model educator in Beijing:

    We Must Also Take Responsibility for Educating Children

    Tao Shufan, Model Education Worker of Beijing, Vice Principal of the Second Affiliated Elementary School of the Normal University

Most beloved People's Liberation Army comrades:

Upon returning to school from my visit with you, I was immediately surrounded by children. They enthusiastically shouted, "Principal Tao is back! How are the PLA uncles? Tell us about the PLA uncles! We love to hear about them!" I understand the children's feelings very well. Before I left, they repeatedly asked me to send their regards to you and to copy down all of your mailing addresses. But, for a moment, I really didn't know how to answer them. I suppressed my excitement, nodded, and said briefly, "Good, the PLA uncles are very well!"

Comrades, satisfying the children's requests is indeed not an easy task. However, your heroic deeds inspire me, and the children's enthusiasm motivates me. Finally, I did it. The very next morning after returning to school, I gave a report to the children. I told them how you bravely and resourcefully fought against the enemy in the past, and how you are now using your wisdom and diligent study to master advanced military technology and culture, confidently defending the socialist construction of the motherland. Although the report lasted a long time, the children listened attentively throughout. Some children had grateful smiles on their faces, some had sparkling tears in their eyes, and some held their small fists tightly to their chests, clearly showing their strength!

Most unforgettable was the scene of distributing candy and peanuts to the children. During the visit at your place, many soldiers stuffed my pockets with candy and peanuts, asking me to bring them back and share them with the children. Now I have done as you instructed. There wasn't much, less than ten peanuts and five or six candies for each class, but the children valued them more than anything. The teachers in each class also used these things to give the children a vivid lesson. They all held discussions, where the children suggested ways to distribute them. Some classes advocated giving them to the "little cadres" in the class because they were Young Pioneers, studying well and serving well. Others advocated giving them to non-members to encourage them to strive to join the organization as soon as possible. Song Zhijie, from the combined third and fourth-grade class, was sick and absent from school. The children wrapped up her share and sent it to her home, hoping to make her happy and recover quickly. In Class A of the third grade, a ten-year-old boy named Li Ning carefully wrapped his share of the gift, writing "The hearts of the PLA uncles and aunts" on it, and told the teacher, "I want to wait until the day I join the organization to eat it!" A girl named Guo Yanhong from the combined third and fourth-grade class sadly returned her share to the teacher, lowered her head, and said with tears in her eyes, "Teacher, don't give it to me! My grades are not good, I shouldn't eat the uncles' and aunts' things!" In reality, comrades, this child's grades are not bad, all above four points, but the child is not satisfied with her performance.

Then, the children launched a wave of writing letters to you. The kindergarten children, who couldn't write, also asked to put their drawings in their older brothers' and sisters' envelopes to send to you. Now, many children have received your replies, and their lives have taken on new meaning. Little Li Meiyun, who usually didn't study hard, and whose parents told her things but she didn't pay attention to anything, often lost textbooks or homework books at school. However, she recently received a letter from Comrade Liu Chunqiu from your unit. The letter inquired about her academic performance, expressed the hope that she would join the organization soon, and said that he would definitely come to the school to see her when he came to Beijing. You know, comrades, how sad the child must have been after reading this letter! She resolved to do as the uncle said. She put Comrade Liu Chunqiu's letter very carefully in her schoolbag and made a beautiful bookmark to clip in the letter. On the bookmark, she wrote "Little Mei will work hard from now on!" with a boldly drawn "!" at the end of the sentence. I know this is the child's solemn vow, and she will definitely strive in that direction.

Dear comrades, seeing these innocent and lovely children, how can we teachers not be excited? Especially after studying our Party's general line for the transition period, and seeing and hearing your heroic deeds, we have further realized the importance of our responsibilities and brought us greater confidence and strength in educating children. My dear colleagues all say, "The PLA comrades are defending the cause of socialist construction, we must further study teaching methods to cultivate children into well-rounded new people, so that they will all become outstanding workers building the motherland in the future!" Therefore, recently the teachers have paid special attention to using classroom teaching and extracurricular activities to educate the children to love labor, so that the children can fully understand that learning is to better serve production, and the importance of labor for national construction. In the sixth-grade Chinese textbook, there is an article titled "The Tractor Team Driven by Girls," which describes how the Soviet socialist labor hero Angelina led girls to drive tractors. Connecting with this article, the teacher also told the children about Xu Jianchun, a graduate of a Shandong high school, participating in agricultural production. From there, the children not only learned how they should live in the future, but also further realized the price that farmers pay for producing grain, and they love the working people even more. Our Chinese Paul Korchagin-style hero, Wu Yunduo, you knew about him long ago. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was wounded three times in order to support you. But he still insisted on working, studied hard, and worked with everyone to create many new weapons and establish several ammunition factories. For the sake of victory on the front lines, even in the hospital ward, he insisted on studying and experimenting. The teachers used extracurricular time to tell the children the story of Comrade Wu Yunduo. The children were all immersed in the scene of Comrade Wu Yunduo's strong character and high intelligence. Originally, the children had long learned from the famous Soviet hero Zoya how to use their thinking ability, and now this will is even stronger. In the past, some children often didn't like to think too much when doing arithmetic problems and would ask others for help. Now they propose to use their own brains to eliminate three points, and many children have completed their plans!

Our school is building a new building, and the teachers have taken advantage of various opportunities to mobilize the children to write letters to the worker uncles, visit and have gatherings at the construction site, and invite model workers from the construction site to give reports. From these vivid educations, the children further recognized the glory and greatness of labor, understood the truth that labor creates the world, and therefore loved labor even more. The children have their own role models, and they also have their own lofty ideals. Some want to be soldiers in the army, navy, and air force, some want to be people's teachers, and some want to be like Angelina and Xu Jianchun, and go to the front lines of agricultural production in the motherland. The children love scholars and experts, and they also respect workers and farmers. They have asked the teachers more than once, "How did Uncle Wang Chonglun complete four years of work in one year?" "How did Uncle Zhang Mingshan invent the 'anti-enclosure plate'?"... Originally, many children had joined the extracurricular radio listening group, and some had also visited the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition." They knew as much about Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, and Xu Jianchun as they did about Uncles Huang Jiguang and Zhang Jihui, but they were not satisfied, they wanted to learn more from all the advanced figures!

Now, the "June 1st" International Children's Day is coming, and the children are busy making various preparations, preparing to write congratulatory letters to you and the Volunteer Army uncles, preparing to have a get-together with Soviet children, and preparing to spend their holiday in a more meaningful way. The teachers also plan to use this opportunity to further conduct a patriotic and internationalist education for the children. We have enough confidence to cultivate these flowers of the motherland to be more beautiful and stronger, and to educate the children to become useful talents for building the motherland. Comrades, since you have taken on the defense of the motherland, we must also work with teachers across the country to take on the responsibility of educating children! (Attached picture)

### 教育孩子的事情我们也要包下来

    教育孩子的事情我们也要包下来
    北京市模范教育工作者
    师范大学第二附属小学副校长
    陶淑范最可爱的人民解放军同志们：
    从你们那里慰问回来，一走到学校，就被孩子们包围了起来。他们热情地喊叫着：“陶校长回来了！解放军叔叔好吧？给我们讲解放军叔叔的事情吧！我们爱听！”我很知道孩子们的思想感情，临走时他们曾再三嘱托，叫我代他们向你们问好，叫我把你们的通讯地址全给抄下来；可是，一时我真不知道该怎么样来回答他们。我压抑着自己激动的心情，点着头，简短地说：“好，解放军叔叔很好！”
    同志们，要满足孩子们的要求，那的确不是一件容易的事。可是，你们的英勇事迹鼓舞着我，孩子们的热情激励着我，我终于这样做了。就在我返校的第二天早晨，我向孩子们做了传达报告。我对孩子们说：你们过去怎样英勇机智地和敌人作战，现在又怎样用自己的智慧和勤学苦练的精神，掌握了高度的军事技术和文化，信心百倍地保卫着祖国的社会主义建设。报告的时间虽然很长，孩子们却一直是全神贯注地听着，有的孩子脸上带着感激的微笑，有的眼里闪着晶莹的泪花，有的把握紧的小拳头放在胸前，显然是在表示自己的力量！
    最令人难忘的，是给孩子们分散糖果和花生的情景。在你们那里进行慰问时，好多战士都把糖和花生塞在我的衣袋里，要我把它带回来分给孩子们吃，现在我已经照着你们的嘱托这样做了。东西很少，分到每个班里还不到十个花生和五六块糖，但孩子们把它看得比什么都珍贵，各班的老师也利用这些东西给孩子们上了生动的一课。他们都开了讨论会，由小朋友提出分配的办法。有的班主张分给班里的“小干部”，因为他们是少年先锋队员，学习得好，服务得好；有的班则主张分给非队员吃，好鼓励他们争取早点入队。复式三四年级班的宋志杰病了，没有来上课，孩子们就把她的一份包好，送到她的家里，意思是使她高兴，早些恢复健康。三年级甲班有一个十岁的男孩子李宁，他把自己分到的一份礼物细心地包了起来，在上面写了“解放军叔叔和阿姨们的心”几个字，还对老师说：“我要等入队那天再吃！”复式三四年级班有一个女孩子叫郭延洪，她很难过地把自己分到的一份送还给老师，低下了小头，眼里闪着泪花说：“老师，不要给我吧！我功课不好，不应该吃叔叔阿姨们的东西！”实际上，同志们，这个孩子的功课并不坏，每门都在四分以上，可是孩子不满足自己的成绩呀。
    接着，孩子们就掀起了给你们写信的热潮，幼儿园的小朋友不会写信，也要求把自己的图画放在哥哥和姐姐的信封里寄给你们。现在，好多小朋友已接到你们的回信，他们的生活更具有新的内容了。李眉云小朋友，平时不大用功，家长嘱咐她，但她什么也不注意，在学校里不是丢教科书，就是丢作业簿。可是，她最近接到了你们那里刘春秋同志的来信，信中询问她的学习成绩，希望她早日入队，还说，来北京的时候一定到学校来看她。你知道，同志们，孩子读完这封信以后该是多么难过呀，她决心照着叔叔的话去做。她把刘春秋同志的来信，很珍重地放在书包里，还亲手做了一个漂亮的书签夹在那封信中，书签上写着“小眉以后努力吧”七个字，句末粗粗地描上一个“！”。我知道，这是孩子庄严的誓言，她一定会朝着这个方向去努力的。
    亲爱的同志们，看到这些天真可爱的孩子，我们做老师的心情怎么能不激动呢？特别是我们学习了咱们党在过渡时期的总路线，和看到、听到你们的英勇事迹后，都进一步感觉到自己的责任重大，也给我们带来了教育孩子更大的信心和力量。我的亲爱的同事们都说：“解放军同志保卫着社会主义的建设事业，我们一定要进一步钻研教学方法，把孩子们培养成全面发展的新人，使他们将来都成为出色的建设祖国的劳动者！”因此，近来老师们都特别注意利用课堂教学和课外活动，向孩子们进行热爱劳动的教育，使孩子们全面地了解学习是为了更好地为生产服务，劳动对于国家建设的重要性。在六年级的国语课本里，有一篇题目叫做“女孩子们驾驶的拖拉机队”的文章，内容是描写苏联社会主义劳动英雄安格林娜如何带动女孩子们驾驶拖拉机的故事，联系着这篇文章，老师也给孩子们讲述了山东省高小毕业生徐建春参加农业生产的情景。从那里，孩子不但知道了将来自己应该如何生活，还进一步体会到农民们为生产粮食所付出的代价，他们更热爱劳动人民了。咱们中国的保尔·柯察金式的英雄人物——吴运铎，你们是早就知道的，在抗日战争时期，他为了支援你们，曾三次负伤。可是他仍然坚持工作，刻苦钻研，和大家一块创造了许多新式武器，建立了好几处军火工厂。为了前线的胜利，就是在病房里，他还是坚持学习和实验。老师们就利用课外的时间，向孩子们讲述吴运铎同志的故事。孩子们都沉醉在吴运铎同志那种坚强的性格和高度的智慧的情景里，本来，孩子们很早就从苏联著名英雄卓娅那里学到了如何运用自己的思考能力，现在，这种意志更坚强了。过去，有些孩子在演算术习题时，常常不喜欢过多的思考就去询问别人，现在他们提出：要用自己的脑子来消灭三分，而且很多孩子都完成了自己的计划！
    我们的学校正在建筑新楼房，老师们就利用多种机会，发动孩子们给工人叔叔写信，到工地参观和联欢，请工地的模范工人做报告。孩子们从这些生动的教育中，进一步认识到劳动的光荣和伟大，了解了劳动创造世界的真理，因而更加热爱劳动了。孩子们有了自己的榜样，也就有了自己的崇高理想。他们有的愿做陆、海、空军的战士，有的愿做人民的教师，有的就愿意像安格林娜和徐建春那样，走到祖国的农业生产战线上。孩子们热爱学者和专家，也同样尊重工人和农民。他们不止一次地向老师追问：“您说王崇伦叔叔怎么一年就完成了四年的工作任务？”“您说张明山伯伯怎么就发明了‘反围盘’？”……本来，好多孩子们都参加了课外收听广播小组，有的还参观了“鞍钢技术革新展览会”，他们对张明山、王崇伦、徐建春也像对黄继光、张积慧叔叔一样了解了许多，但他们并不满足，他们想从所有的先进人物中学习到更多的东西！
    现在，“六一”国际儿童节就要来到了，孩子们正在紧张地做着这样或那样的准备，准备着给你们和志愿军叔叔写慰问信，准备着和苏联小朋友联欢，准备着更有意义地度过自己的节日。老师们也都打算利用这一机会，进一步向孩子们进行一次爱国主义和国际主义的教育。我们都有足够的信心：把祖国这些花朵培植得更美丽，更健壮，把孩子们教养成建设祖国的有用人才。同志们，你们既然把祖国的国防包下来了，我们也要和全国教师一起，把教好孩子的事情全包下来！（附图片）
