    Local Industries Actively Support Basic Construction
    Striving to Produce Construction Materials and Undertake the Manufacturing of New Factory Machinery and Equipment
    [Report from this newspaper] Local state-owned industries are giving full play to their initiative in vigorously supporting national basic construction projects. Over a thousand kinds of building materials produced by local state-owned factories in Northeast China are being continuously sent to various basic construction sites. The Shenyang Refractory Materials Factory will supply the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory with 8,000 tons of refractory bricks for repairing open-hearth furnaces this year. The plywood produced by the Songjiang Plywood Factory and the Changchun Plywood Factory is an important material for building construction. Currently, in addition to supplying Northeast China, the products of these two factories are also supplying the needs of many units in Beijing, Tianjin, and Xi'an. Local state-owned factories in Northeast China plan to produce a large number of building materials such as large hardware and small hardware this year. The China Hardware and Machinery Corporation Northeast Region Company alone plans to supply 872 tons of iron nails. Many local state-owned factories are also preparing to add new varieties to meet the needs of basic construction. After conducting surveys in Shenyang, Changchun, and other places, the Liaodong Ceramics Factory is preparing to trial-produce colored and patterned ceramic tiles based on user feedback.
    Local industries in the Northwest region are producing many products this year to support basic construction, including cement, bricks, tiles, lime, slag, refractory bricks, cement pipes, ceramic pipes, and asbestos powder and asbestos work clothes for fire prevention and insulation, as well as spraying machines, etc. In order to complete the production plan, many factories have added new equipment. For example, the Xi'an First Brick and Tile Factory will add two brick-making machines this year, and the Lianhuasi Slag Yard will extend a section of railway this year. Many factory workers are actively engaged in labor competitions to improve production efficiency.
    Seven local state-owned machinery and telecommunications equipment factories in Tianjin will manufacture various machinery and equipment for important basic construction projects in various regions during the second quarter. The first batch of machinery and equipment undertaken by these seven factories totals more than 700 units, including 51 varieties, of which 33 are new products. After being educated on the general task of the state during the transition period, the workers in these factories clearly recognized the important significance of local industries supporting national construction and criticized the past idea of being unwilling to undertake odd jobs. Therefore, although the machinery and equipment undertaken by these factories this time are of various types and specifications, and the order quantity of some products is small, they all regard it as an important task for the entire factory.
    Since the beginning of this year, local state-owned factories in Baotou have strengthened planning management and technical management to support basic construction, and paid attention to exploiting potential strength. Some workers in the Baotou Porcelain Factory criticized the idea of "closing shop" and decided to focus on the production of refractory materials this year. The factory is also preparing to build a large round kiln, increase machinery and equipment, and expand production workshops. Since the first quarter of this year, the Baotou Machinery Factory has manufactured more than 240 new products, including slurry mixers, overhead cranes, hand drills, radiators, and steel house frames. The factory's original production equipment was simple and the technical level was not high, but thanks to the technical innovation movement launched by the workers, many machines and equipment were improved, greatly improving labor efficiency. For example, they used waste iron and waste materials to manufacture a water pipe vertical and horizontal lifting machine, which shortened the mold-setting and pipe-lifting time from 45 minutes to 90 seconds. Now the workers are working hard to improve product quality.
    Many factories in Hubei and Hunan provinces are supplying a large amount of building materials needed for the expansion project of the Daye Steel Plant. The brick, tile, and lime factories under the Huangshi Municipal Industrial Bureau have produced a large amount of building materials for the Daye Steel Plant. The bureau has also built new brick, tile, crushed stone, woodware, and ironwork factories, and some factories have begun production.

    地方工业积极支援基本建设
    努力生产建筑器材和承制新厂机器设备
    【本报讯】地方国营工业发挥积极性，大力支援国家基本建设工程。东北各地地方国营工厂生产的一千多种建筑材料，正源源不断地送往各基本建设工地。沈阳耐火材料厂今年要供应沈阳重型机器厂八千吨修平炉用的耐火砖。松江胶合板厂和长春胶合板厂生产的胶合板，是修建楼房的重要材料，现在，这两厂的产品除供应东北各地外，还供应了北京、天津和西安等地不少单位的需要。东北各地地方国营工厂今年计划生产大量的大五金和小五金等建筑器材。仅由中国五金机械公司东北区公司计划供应的铁钉就有八百七十二吨。还有不少地方国营工厂准备增加新品种，以满足基本建设的需要。辽东陶瓷厂主动到沈阳、长春等地调查后，准备根据用户意见，试制有色和带花的磁砖。
    西北区地方工业今年为支援基本建设而生产的产品很多，主要的有水泥、砖瓦、石灰、石渣、耐火砖、水泥管、陶瓷管和防火、保暖用的石棉粉、石棉工作服以及喷涂机器等。为了完成生产计划，许多工厂增添了新的设备。如西安第一砖瓦厂今年要增添两部制砖机，莲花寺石渣场在今年将增铺一段铁路。许多工厂职工为提高生产效率，正积极展开劳动竞赛。
    天津市有七个地方国营机器、电讯器材工厂，第二季度将为各地重要基本建设工程制造各种机器设备。这七个工厂承制的第一批机器设备共七百多台，包括五十一种品种，其中有三十三种是新产品。这些工厂的职工，在受到国家过渡时期总任务的教育以后，明确地认识了地方工业支援国家建设的重要意义，对过去不愿承揽零活的思想进行了批判。因此，这次这些工厂承制的机器设备虽然种类繁多，规格不一，有的产品的订货量很少，但他们都把它作为全厂的重要任务加以执行。
    包头市地方国营工厂为支援基本建设，今年以来都加强了计划管理和技术管理，注意发挥了潜在力量。包头造瓷厂部分职工批判了“收摊子”的思想，确定今年以生产耐火器材为主。该厂并准备修建一座大圆窑，增加机器设备，扩建生产车间。包头机械厂今年第一季度以来，共制造了泥浆搅拌机、天车、手摇钻、暖气片、钢房架等新产品达二百四十多种。该厂原来的生产设备简陋，技术水平不高，但由于职工们展开了技术革新运动，改进了不少的机器设备，大大提高了劳动效率。如他们用废铁、废料制造了一部水管横竖升降机，放模子、吊管子的时间由过去四十五分钟缩短到九十秒。现在职工们正为提高产品质量而努力。
    湖北、湖南两省许多工厂正大量供应大冶钢厂扩建工程所需要的建筑材料，黄石市工业局所属砖、瓦、石灰等厂，已为大冶钢厂生产了大量的建筑材料。该局还新建了砖瓦、碎石、木器、铁工等工厂，有的工厂已开始生产。
