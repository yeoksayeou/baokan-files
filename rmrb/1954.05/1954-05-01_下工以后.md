    After Work
    Soviet Chelyabinsk Stalin Tractor Factory Worker Xie·Rushnikov
    The satirical drama by Ukrainian writer Mikola was premiered at the Cultural Palace of the Chelyabinsk Stalin Tractor Factory. Our workers' theater troupe performed the drama "Without a Name" for the national festival - the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia.
    In this play, I play the agronomist Vasily Netudykhat. Although I am a fitter who repairs lathes in a workshop in our factory, rather than a professional actor, this is my fifteenth performance. In "Without a Name," like the other plays that our workers' theater troupe has rehearsed, my beloved Yevgenia Vasilyevna also participates, and she works with me at the tractor factory.
    Participating in the workers' theater troupe's performances is our best entertainment and the best entertainment for many comrades who like to go to the Cultural Palace after work.
    Those who often participate in the performances with me include fitter Grigory Stolbushken, who has been with the troupe for sixteen years; as well as engineer Irina Sibanova, accountant Vera Sheina, and other comrades. Young factory workers also participated in the performance of the drama "Without a Name," and these young workers are also studying in the drama class attached to the workers' theater troupe.
    Our participation in performances not only allows us to rest, but also makes the tractor manufacturers very happy. The work of the theater troupe has greatly improved our cultural level.
    Let me talk about myself. I have been working in the factory for fifteen years. I have changed from a fitter apprentice to a highly skilled worker, and now I lead a fitter group that repairs the most complex factory equipment.
    The wide-ranging and varied activities of the Cultural Palace have promoted the improvement of my production skills. Here, all of us tractor manufacturers get rest and gain a lot of useful knowledge to improve our technical and cultural level.
    The Cultural Palace has taken some measures to exchange the experiences of innovators, helping workers improve their technical knowledge in groups and technical research rooms, watch scientific films, and listen to reports and explanations from the most famous experts and production innovators. Participating in amateur art groups—such as workers' theater troupes, choirs, dance troupes, folk bands, Russian folk song choirs, and fine arts studios—enhances our general knowledge and our artistic appreciation.
    The Soviet government allocates a large amount of funds for the work of cultural palaces and cultural homes, workers' clubs, and libraries, where working people can spend their free time.
    My beloved and I read many books to create the images in the workers' theater troupe's dramas. The Cultural Palace has set up a large library for us, with nearly 200,000 books. Many tractor manufacturers and their families—active readers—often come to the library's reading room after work.
    This is how we spend our free time after work every day. My beloved and I, like all the workers in our factory, enjoy the rights conferred by the Soviet Constitution—during our annual vacation, we spend our time in sanatoriums or rest homes. For example, last year our workers' theater troupe collectively spent its holiday in our factory's rest home located in the scenic area at the foot of the Ural Mountains. During this year's vacation, all members of our troupe plan to tour various cities in the Chelyabinsk Oblast. The troupe has won this right with its excellent creative activities.
    This is how we live, work, and rest.
    We should thank our Communist Party and the Soviet government for our happy and prosperous life, which tirelessly cares about the continuous improvement of the material level and happiness of all working people in the victorious socialist country, and cares about our cultural entertainment and rest.

    下工以后
    苏联齐良宾斯克斯大林拖拉机工厂工人　谢·鲁施尼科夫
    在齐良宾斯克斯大林拖拉机工厂的文化宫里，初次上演了乌克兰作家米科的讽刺剧。我们的工人剧团为全民的节日——乌克兰与俄罗斯重新合并三百周年——演出了话剧“不说姓名”。
    在这个剧中，我扮演了农学家华西里·涅图迪哈特。虽然我是我们工厂一个车间修理车床的钳工，而不是职业演员，可是这回已是我的第十五次演出了。在“不说姓名”这个剧中，也像我们工人剧团曾排演的其他剧一样，我的爱人叶菲根尼娅·华西里耶芙娜也参加了，她和我一起在拖拉机工厂工作。
    参加工人剧团演剧是我们最好的娱乐，也是喜欢在下工以后到文化宫去的许多同志的最好娱乐。
    和我一起常参加演剧的有钳工格里哥里·斯托尔布施肯，他参加剧团已有十六年；还有工程师伊丽娜·西巴诺娃、会计员维拉·谢伊娜和其他同志。工厂的青年工人也参加了话剧“不说姓名”的演出，这些青年工人同时在工人剧团附设的戏剧班学习。
    我们参加演剧，不仅可以休息，而且使拖拉机制造者们非常愉快。剧团的工作使我们大大提高了文化水平。
    谈谈我自己吧。我在工厂里已经工作了十五年。我从钳工学徒变成了高度熟练的工人，现在领导修理最复杂的工厂装备的钳工小组。
    文化宫的广泛的和各种各样的活动，促进了我在生产技能上的提高，在这里我们全体拖拉机制造者得到了休息，获得了提高我们的技术和文化水平的许多有益的知识。
    文化宫采取了一些关于交换革新者经验的措施，帮助工人在小组和技术研究室里提高他们的技术知识，看科学影片，听取最著名的专家和生产革新者的报告和解说。参加业余艺术团体——如工人剧团、合唱队、舞蹈团、民间乐队、俄罗斯民歌合唱团和造型艺术工作室，提高我们的一般知识和我们的艺术鉴赏能力。
    苏联政府拨出大量经费用于文化宫和文化之家、工人俱乐部以及图书馆的工作，劳动人民可以在这些地方度过他们的空闲时间。
    我和我的爱人为了创造工人剧团的戏剧中的形象，读了许多书。文化宫为我们设立了一个大型图书馆，拥有近二十万册书。许多拖拉机制造者和他们的家属——积极的读者——在工作以后常常到图书馆的阅览室来。
    我们每天工作以后的空暇时间就是这样度过的。我和我的爱人，像我们工厂的所有的工人一样，享有苏联宪法所赋予的权利——每年休假期间，我们都在疗养院或在休养所里度过。例如去年我们工人剧团就在我们工厂设于乌拉尔山山麓风景区的休养所集体度过了自己的假日。今年休假期间，我们剧团全体人员准备在齐良宾斯克州各城市作巡回演出。剧团以它优良的创作活动取得了这个权利。
    我们就这样生活、工作和休息。
    我们之所以有这样愉快和幸福的生活，应当感谢我们的共产党和苏维埃政府，它们不倦地关心胜利了的社会主义国家全体劳动人民的物质水平和幸福的不断提高，关心我们的文化娱乐和休息。
