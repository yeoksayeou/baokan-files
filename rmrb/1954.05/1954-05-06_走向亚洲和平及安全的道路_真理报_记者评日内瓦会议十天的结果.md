Xinhua News Agency, May 5th. TASS Moscow, May 5th: "Pravda" published an article by its Geneva special correspondents Zhukov, Prischevsky, and Lasakin, entitled "The Road to Peace and Security in Asia."

The article said that the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference has been open for nearly ten days. The results of these days of meetings once again prove that aggressive forces are suffering failures, and the proposition of peacefully resolving international disputes through consultation is gaining new supporters.

A prominent feature of the Geneva Conference is that the voice of the great nation of the People's Republic of China is resonating powerfully and confidently on this international stage. Western European newspapers have given due attention to this very important matter.

The active participation of the People's Republic of China in the work of the Geneva Conference undoubtedly demonstrates that the increased role and importance of the Asian people in all international affairs has been recognized. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, raised fundamental issues in his speech and explained the fundamental interests of the Asian people, who, like the European people, are concerned with strengthening universal peace and security.

The article went on to say that the Asian people's desire for independence and peace is perfectly understandable. For hundreds of years, Asian countries have been in a state of colonies, semi-colonies, and dependencies. The history of recent decades has taught the Asian people great lessons. At the same time, the development of the post-war situation shows that colonial countries are still trying to suppress the national liberation movements of the Eastern people.

The article pointed out that today is not the 19th century, nor the beginning of the 20th century. In our time, the Asian people have firmly grasped their own destiny and are determined to fight for their freedom and independence. It is impossible to ignore this at present.

The article emphasized that the Asian people are increasingly clearly aware that the real road to achieving peace and security in Asia is to unite the strength of Asian countries regardless of their different social systems. The collective efforts of Asian countries, which account for more than half of the world's population, can and will ease tensions in Asia and the world.

The Geneva Conference shows that the importance of Asian issues in international affairs has increased. The People's Republic of China has achieved its due status as a major power in the international arena, and it is contributing to peace. Despite the efforts of those who oppose peace, the proposition of uniting the strength of the Asian people to safeguard Asian security is increasingly supported by the people. The article concluded by saying that if there is a collective effort by the Asian people to strengthen peace and security, coupled with the establishment of a European collective security system, lasting world peace can be guaranteed.

    走向亚洲和平及安全的道路
    ——“真理报”记者评日内瓦会议十天的结果
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：“真理报”发表了该报日内瓦特派记者茹科夫、普利歇夫斯基和拉萨金的一篇文章，题为“走向亚洲和平及安全的道路”。
    文章说，日内瓦外长会议开幕将近十天了。这些天的会议结果再次证明，侵略势力在遭受失败，通过协商方式和平解决国际争端的主张正在得到新的支持者。
    日内瓦会议的突出的景象是，中华人民共和国这个大国的声音有力地、充满信心地在这个国际讲台上震响着。西欧报纸对这件十分重要的事情给予了应有的注意。
    中华人民共和国积极参加日内瓦会议工作一事无疑说明，亚洲人民在一切国际事务中的已经增加了的作用和重要性得到了承认。中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来在他的发言中提出了根本性的问题，并说明了正像欧洲人民一样关怀加强普遍和平与安全的亚洲人民的根本利益。
    文章接着说，亚洲人民争取独立与和平的愿望是完全可以理解的。数百年来，亚洲国家一直处于殖民地、半殖民地和附属国的地位。近几十年的历史给了亚洲人民很大的教训。同时，战后局势的发展又说明，殖民国家还在设法压制东方人民的民族解放运动。
    文章指出，但是今天不是十九世纪，也不是二十世纪初叶了。在我们这个时代，亚洲人民已坚定地掌握着他们自己的命运，并决心为他们的自由与独立而斗争。在目前要无视这一点是不可能的。
    文章强调说，亚洲人民日益清楚地认识到，要实现亚洲的和平与安全，真正的道路就是亚洲各国不分社会制度的不同而把它们的力量联合起来。人口占全人类二分之一以上的亚洲国家的集体努力可以、而且会使亚洲以及世界紧张局势得到缓和。
    日内瓦会议说明，亚洲问题在国际事务中的重要性已经加大了。中华人民共和国已在国际上取得了应有的大国地位，它正在对和平作出贡献。尽管反对和平的人竭力反对，团结亚洲人民的力量来维护亚洲安全的主张日益受到人们的拥护。文章最后说，如果有了亚洲人民为加强和平与安全而作的集体努力，再加上欧洲集体安全体系的建立，就可以保证世界的持久和平。
