    Soviet Newspapers Are the Bugle of Truth
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    May 5th is the National Press Day in the Soviet Union. On this day in 1912, the first issue of "Pravda," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was published. Since then, for forty-two years, "Pravda" has tirelessly promoted Marxist-Leninist theory, uniting and mobilizing workers to fight for the realization of communist ideals. This day has become a traditional Press Day for the Soviet people. This fully demonstrates the importance attached to the press by the entire Soviet society and the love of the Soviet people for newspapers, periodicals, and books, which are sources of truth and knowledge.
    Under the care of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the government, and all the people, the Soviet Union has a huge press network serving the people. The Soviet Union now publishes about 7,800 newspapers, with a circulation of over 44 million copies. The circulation of "Pravda" alone exceeds the circulation of all newspapers in Russia before the revolution in 1913. The Soviet Union now publishes about 1,500 magazines and other periodicals. Among them, "Kommunist," the political and theoretical journal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has a circulation of 720,000 copies, while the first issue thirty years ago had only 12,000 copies. The Soviet Union now has more than 200 publishing houses, which published about 1 billion books in 1953, more than double that of 1940. The abundance of spiritual food is one of the signs of the prosperity of Soviet culture.
    Soviet newspapers are rightly regarded as the bugle of truth. The voice of "Pravda," the most prestigious newspaper in the world, and other Soviet newspapers spreads to every corner of the globe, inspiring progressive humanity to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism. Soviet newspapers are now making significant efforts to ease international tensions.
    Soviet newspapers are a powerful weapon of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in building a communist society. To ensure the completion of the primary task put forward by the Party – greatly increasing the production of agricultural products and daily-use industrial products – Soviet newspapers are conducting unremitting education and struggle. They constantly mobilize the masses to discover potential strengths in various sectors of the national economy. For example, they strongly support and develop the competition to make full use of existing production sites and equipment in industry, increase labor productivity, expand varieties, reduce costs, and improve quality. They strongly support and develop the movement of agricultural technicians going to the countryside and young people participating in the reclamation of new land. They comprehensively explore issues related to further developing agriculture, reclaiming new land, and specifically leading socialist competitions.
    Soviet newspapers have the mission of carrying out communist education for the workers. The Party constantly conducts Marxist-Leninist propaganda through them. This propaganda has greatly improved the communist consciousness of the vast readership. They are now paying particular attention to overcoming the dogmatic shortcomings in propaganda and promoting the creative mastery of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The number of propaganda articles in Soviet newspapers that are currently linked to practical reality has greatly increased, propaganda articles full of quotations are gradually disappearing, and the struggle against dogmatism has achieved significant results.
    One of the greatest characteristics of Soviet newspapers is that they criticize shortcomings in all aspects of society without any consideration for face, in order to promote social progress. Open Soviet newspapers, from editorials, news reports, special articles, readers' letters, to essays, you can see that criticism has not been interrupted for a moment. Since the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially since last year, criticism has been even more widely展开. From the criticism in Soviet newspapers, it can be seen that in the Soviet Union, criticism pays special attention to: 1. Preventing complacency and pride; 2. Giving play to the initiative of the masses from the bottom up; 3. Exposing and overcoming shortcomings that are still in their nascent stages. For example, editorials in Soviet newspapers always criticize shortcomings after talking about achievements. In the past year, the weight of criticism of shortcomings in these editorials has increased, advocating named criticism, and making specific analyses of the causes of shortcomings and methods to overcome them. When a reader's letter criticizes a government department, this department must carefully hold a meeting to study it, quickly accept the criticism in this newspaper, and be responsible for correcting it in action. After the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee made a decision to further develop agriculture last year, Soviet newspapers, in accordance with the Party's instructions, constantly warned people that achievements do not come spontaneously, but are obtained through struggle. Even today, in order to ensure the implementation of the Party's decision, Soviet newspapers continue to criticize certain bureaucratic and red-tape phenomena in the work of the organs. In the view of Soviet newspapers, since criticism is the driving force of social development, it is very natural to dare to criticize and be happy to accept criticism. It would be strange if newspapers representing public opinion did not have or lacked criticism related to social concerns.
    In our daily contact with Soviet newspapers, we realize that it is no accident that Soviet newspapers are able to fulfill the important responsibilities entrusted to them by the Party and the people. First, this is because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at all levels constantly cares about and guides the work of Soviet newspapers. Second, this is because Soviet newspapers have close ties with the people. Third, this is because Soviet newspaper workers recognize the importance of newspaper work and selflessly and conscientiously strive to do a good job as collective propagandists, mobilizers, and organizers. For example, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at all levels often discusses the work of newspapers. The authors of newspapers are not just one or two chief writers, but all editors and reporters; not only all editors and reporters, but also people from all walks of life. Whether scientists or writers, they all regard newspaper work as an honor. Newspaper work is generally heavier than other work, and newspaper workers constantly study and improve their self-cultivation.

### 苏联报刊是真理的号角

    苏联报刊是真理的号角
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李　何
    五月五日，苏联全国纪念报刊节。一九一二年这一天，苏联共产党中央委员会机关报——“真理报”第一期出版。从那时候起，四十二年来“真理报”不倦地宣传马克思列宁主义理论，团结和动员劳动者为实现共产主义的理想而斗争。这一天就成为苏联人民的传统的报刊节。这充分表现了苏联整个社会对报刊的重视，表现了苏联人民对宣传真理和知识源泉的报纸、刊物和书籍的爱护。
    在苏联共产党、政府和全体人民的关怀之下，苏联拥有巨大的为人民服务的报刊网。苏联现在出版着约七千八百种报纸，发行超过四千四百万份，仅“真理报”的份数就超过革命前一九一三年俄国所有报纸的份数。苏联现在出版着约一千五百种杂志和其他期刊，其中苏联共产党中央委员会的政治和理论刊物“共产党人”杂志发行达七十二万份，而三十年前第一期不过一万二千份。苏联现在有二百多个出版社，在一九五三年出版了约十亿种书籍，超过一九四○年一倍多。精神食粮的充足，正是苏维埃文化繁荣的标志之一。
    苏联报刊被公正地认为真理的号角。世界上最有威信的“真理报”和其他苏联报刊的声音，传播到地球各个角落，鼓舞着进步人类为和平、为民主和社会主义而斗争。苏联报刊现在正为缓和国际紧张局势作着重大的努力。
    苏联报刊是苏联共产党在建设共产主义社会中的强大武器。为保证完成党所提出的首要任务——大大提高农产品和日用工业品的生产，苏联报刊进行着不懈的教育与斗争。它们经常动员群众在国民经济各部门发掘潜在力量。例如，极力支持和发展在工业中充分利用现有生产场地和设备的竞赛，提高劳动生产率。扩增品种、减低成本和提高质量的竞赛。极力支持和发展农业技术人员下乡去，青年参加开垦新地的运动。全面地探讨着进一步发展农业，开垦新地，具体领导社会主义竞赛各项问题。
    苏联报刊负有使命对劳动者进行共产主义教育。党经过它们经常进行马克思列宁主义宣传。这种宣传大大提高了广大读者的共产主义觉悟。它们现在特别注意克服宣传中的教条主义缺点，提倡创造性掌握马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说。从苏联报刊目前联系实际的宣传论文大大增多，满纸引证的宣传论文渐渐绝迹了，反对教条主义的斗争已取得显著的成绩。
    苏联报刊最大的特点之一，是不留任何情面地批评社会各个方面的缺点，以推动社会的进步。打开苏联报纸，从社论、通讯、专文、读者来信，到小品文，你可以看到：没有一时一刻间断了批评。从苏联共产党第十九次代表大会以来，特别是从去年以来，批评更是广泛展开。从苏联报刊的批评中可以看到，在苏联批评特别注意：一、防止自满和骄傲；二、自下而上发挥群众积极性；三、揭发和克服还在萌芽状态的缺点。例如苏联报刊的社论说到成绩以后一定批评缺点。最近一年来，这些社论中批评缺点的分量增加了，提倡指名的批评，对缺点的原因和克服的方法都作出具体的分析。读者来信批评某政府部门时，这部门一定慎重开会研究，迅速在这个报纸上接受批评并在行动中负责改正。去年苏共中央九月全会作出进一步发展农业的决议以后，苏联报刊就根据党的指示，不断告诫人们说，成绩不是自流而来的，是经过争取的。一直到今天，苏联报刊为了保证实现党的决定，还不断地批评机关工作中的某些官僚主义和文牍主义现象。在苏联报刊看来，批评既然是社会发展的推动力，那么敢于批评和乐于接受批评，是很自然的事。代表社会舆论的报刊而没有或缺少关系社会痛痒的批评，那才是怪事。
    在我们和苏联报刊的日常接触中，我们体会到苏联报刊之所以能够完成党和人民所付托的重大责任，不是偶然的。第一，这是由于苏联共产党各级组织经常关心和指导着苏联报刊的工作。第二，这是由于苏联报刊与人民群众有密切的联系。第三，这是由于苏联报刊工作者都认识报刊工作的重要性，为做好这集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的工作而忘我地兢兢业业地努力着。例如：苏联共产党各级组织经常讨论报刊的工作。报刊的作者不只是一二主笔，而且有全体编辑和记者；不只是全体编辑和记者，而且有社会各界，不论科学家还是作家都以为报刊工作为荣。报刊工作一般比别的工作重，而报刊工作者还不断地学习和提高自己的修养。
