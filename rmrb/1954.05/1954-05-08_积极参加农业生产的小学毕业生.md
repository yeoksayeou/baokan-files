Primary School Graduates Actively Participating in Agricultural Production

An Excellent and Upstanding Member of the Collective

Last year, when the first collective farm in LÃ¼da City, the Friendship Orchard Collective Farm, was established, Geng Yuxiang, a primary school graduate, and her entire family joined the farm.

After joining the collective farm, Geng Yuxiang was deeply moved by the joyous labor of the farm members. She worked on the farm doing various tasks such as orchard cleaning, tree scraping, applying protective agents, and disinfectants. The work was heavy, but she worked with great enthusiasm and never missed a workday. The farm held a photo exhibition of Soviet collective farms. After seeing it, she greatly admired the happy life of Soviet farmers, but she also realized that this kind of life was not easily obtained. She said, "Although we are far behind the Soviet Union in comparison, as long as we learn from the Soviet Union and work hard, we will have the same happy life as the Soviet people in the future."

Technicians from the county's technical guidance station often came to the farm, and recently professors and students from Beijing Agricultural University also came to the farm to study pests and diseases. She often approached them and learned from them. Her eagerness to learn and her inquisitive spirit earned her praise from everyone. During breaks, while other girls went to play, she squatted on the ground carefully looking for insect cocoons in the soil. She also participated in the "Technical Training Class" organized by the district. She learned about the development process of various insects.

In the spare-time school, she was an excellent student in both character and academics: never absent, with consistently excellent grades; and always willing to help others. With her patient help, Li Guizhi, who was struggling in her studies, quickly improved. In the production team, she was able to obey the leadership's assignments, and in the class, she was very respectful of the teachers, so everyone loved Geng Yuxiang.

"Don't follow the detours I once took!"

When Li Jiachun graduated from primary school last year, there was a drought, and many farmers in the village could not plant wheat. Many people held the idea of "relying on the heavens for food" and waited for rain. But Li Jiachun did not believe in the nonsense of "relying on the heavens for food." He carried water to irrigate the land and planted wheat. People saw Li Jiachun's unusual actions and came to him for advice. He explained the relationship between rainfall and the atmosphere to the masses and mobilized them to carry water to fight the drought. The villagers said, "After all, he is literate and knows more things."

Li Jiachun became a strong assistant to the cadres: helping the township head write summary reports, helping the people's school teacher prepare lessons, and assisting in filling out voter certificates.

When he first came out of school, he was unwilling to live in the countryside. In his opinion, farming was just a rough job that did not require any cultural knowledge. But now his understanding has changed. He realized that farming requires knowledge, and requires knowledge in many areas.

After realizing this, he was determined to dedicate his youth to agricultural production and diligently learn how to use plows and bulldozers. He also often applied the knowledge he had learned from books in the past to production, using scientific methods for seed soaking and preventing pests and diseases.

One day, many students from Pingdu County, Shandong Province, went to visit Li Jiachun and asked him to talk about his feelings after participating in agricultural production. He said, "Students, study hard! Serving the people is glorious, but don't despise agricultural production. Don't follow the detours I once took."

A Good Example for Zhuang Youth in Western Guangxi

Although Li Shanming had studied in junior high school, he seemed like an expert when it came to farming. Last spring, he led the mutual aid team to reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area. In the autumn, when crops were hit by drought and pests, he led the mutual aid team to carry water to fight the drought and eliminate pests. Under his influence, more than two hundred large and small canals were built throughout the township, and more than twenty waterwheels were repaired, ensuring a good harvest.

Li Shanming is an excellent propagandist. He can actively and patiently promote the socialist future of agriculture to farmers. Under his leadership, the first agricultural production cooperative and three perennial mutual aid teams in the county were established. He was supported by the local people of all ethnic groups, and he was elected as a production model in Fengshan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The local people's love for Li Shanming further strengthened his determination to engage in agricultural production. Recently, at his suggestion, the agricultural cooperative ordered books on agricultural production technology in order to learn from the production experience of various regions and scientific knowledge related to production, improve production, and build the mountainous area more beautifully.

"With my single hands, how could I have such a good harvest!"

When Yang Jinquan is mentioned, the farmers in Dongnan Township all praise him, saying: This child did not study in vain. His production and work are all good. He is nineteen years old this year and is from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. After graduating from senior primary school during the summer vacation last year, he stayed at home to participate in agricultural production.

Yang Jinquan's family has seven acres and seven fen of land, of which one acre and three fen is of very poor quality. He broke the township's custom and, last spring, he and his mother carried sixty loads of pond mud to the field and also added pig manure. At the autumn harvest, they harvested two thousand three hundred and sixty jin, exceeding the production of the previous year. His mother happily said to people, "If it weren't for this child at home, with my single hands, how could I have such a good harvest!"

Usually, he can actively respond to the call of the People's Government. For example, last year, rice in the township was infested with rice borers. According to the instructions of the township People's Government, he mobilized the young people in the mutual aid team to use moth traps in the fields to catch rice borers. During the autumn harvest and winter plowing production, he often walked in front of everyone, conducting propaganda and education for the farmers.

Now, Yang Jinquan has become a member of the Communist Youth League.

A Good Accountant for the Agricultural Production Cooperative

Ye Guoliang is the accountant of the Dongta Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in District One, Minhou County, Fujian Province. This year, the number of cooperative members has expanded from seventeen households to twenty-five households, so the work seems more complicated than before. However, Ye Guoliang's accounts are still clear and accurate. On the contract work sheet, it is clearly written: plowing, topdressing, making field ridges, transplanting rice seedlings, harrowing grass, etc. Under each item, the labor hours spent are carefully recorded; what is "receipts" and what is "payments" are also written neatly, making it clear at a glance.

Ye Guoliang is not a graduate of a specialized school, but only studied for a few years in a junior high school. The reason why he does accounting work so well is mainly because he loves the cooperative and loves labor. Usually, in addition to doing accounting work, he also helps everyone learn culture and teaches the members how to use the abacus. He also actively participates in labor and humbly learns the techniques of transplanting rice seedlings from everyone. Now, he can participate in carrying manure and harvesting rice just like adults.

Meng Qingyun Loves Labor

Meng Qingyun was born into a poor peasant family in the suburbs of Benxi City. After liberation, the new life brought her hope, and she finished six years of courses in five years. After graduating from elementary school, life put forward new questions to her: "How should I welcome the new life? Should I continue my studies, or should I stay at home and participate in production?" She often considered this question in her mind, but could not find a solution.

The village Party branch held a meeting calling on young people to participate in agricultural production. After listening to the words of the branch secretary, she decided to stay in the village and engage in production.

However, everything had to be learned from scratch. For example, when sowing seeds, she didn't know how to spread the seeds evenly. She often said to herself: "I have to stand up straight and not let the masses laugh at me." She humbly learned from the old farmers. When others rested, she experimented in the fields. When learning to step on the grid, because her feet were small and she couldn't step well, she put on her father's shoes and stuffed them with grass.

Now, Meng Qingyun has been rated as a production model in Benxi City, and her name is familiar to the young people of the city. Many young people have written to her, expressing their desire to learn her excellent quality of loving labor.

A Capable Female Mutual Aid Team Leader

Liu Jinhua is nineteen years old this year and is from Fangjia Village, District Two, Lushun City. After graduating from elementary school, she joined the mutual aid team. During the autumn harvest, she was good at harvesting, loading, and unloading. When planting autumn wheat, she also learned how to twist seeds and apply manure, and was as good as a young man.

During the Spring Festival this year, the rural areas rectified the mutual aid teams. The team members said, "This year is different from previous years. We must properly rectify the work of the team and re-elect the mutual aid team leader." At that time, everyone felt that Liu Jinhua was capable of both labor and calculation, and unanimously elected her as the mutual aid team leader.

After the Spring Festival, the mutual aid team began to deliver manure. In addition to applying and unloading manure, she also learned to drive a cart.

The village's cultural study class collapsed after the Spring Festival this year due to an unconsolidated foundation. The village cadres entrusted the task of organizing the study class to her and her classmate Zhao Xiuying. After accepting the task, they mobilized the masses to participate in the study, door to door. The study class was restored, but there were no teachers, so the two of them became teachers in the cultural class. Because they carefully prepared their lessons and taught conscientiously, the students had a high learning enthusiasm and maintained a 90% attendance rate.

She does not fall behind in any work. She joined the village drama troupe and performed "A Good Life Depends on Industrialization." She often leads team members to the mountains to plant trees, catch pine tree insects, and so on. She said: "Several months of labor have made me realize that labor is glorious in the new society."
