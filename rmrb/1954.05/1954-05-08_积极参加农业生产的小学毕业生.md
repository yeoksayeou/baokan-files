Primary School Graduates Actively Participating in Agricultural Production

An Excellent and Upstanding Member of the Collective

Last year, when the first collective farm in Lüda City, the Friendship Orchard Collective Farm, was established, Geng Yuxiang, a primary school graduate, and her entire family joined the farm.

After joining the collective farm, Geng Yuxiang was deeply moved by the joyous labor of the farm members. She worked on the farm doing various tasks such as orchard cleaning, tree scraping, applying protective agents, and disinfectants. The work was heavy, but she worked with great enthusiasm and never missed a workday. The farm held a photo exhibition of Soviet collective farms. After seeing it, she greatly admired the happy life of Soviet farmers, but she also realized that this kind of life was not easily obtained. She said, "Although we are far behind the Soviet Union in comparison, as long as we learn from the Soviet Union and work hard, we will have the same happy life as the Soviet people in the future."

Technicians from the county's technical guidance station often came to the farm, and recently professors and students from Beijing Agricultural University also came to the farm to study pests and diseases. She often approached them and learned from them. Her eagerness to learn and her inquisitive spirit earned her praise from everyone. During breaks, while other girls went to play, she squatted on the ground carefully looking for insect cocoons in the soil. She also participated in the "Technical Training Class" organized by the district. She learned about the development process of various insects.

In the spare-time school, she was an excellent student in both character and academics: never absent, with consistently excellent grades; and always willing to help others. With her patient help, Li Guizhi, who was struggling in her studies, quickly improved. In the production team, she was able to obey the leadership's assignments, and in the class, she was very respectful of the teachers, so everyone loved Geng Yuxiang.

"Don't follow the detours I once took!"

When Li Jiachun graduated from primary school last year, there was a drought, and many farmers in the village could not plant wheat. Many people held the idea of "relying on the heavens for food" and waited for rain. But Li Jiachun did not believe in the nonsense of "relying on the heavens for food." He carried water to irrigate the land and planted wheat. People saw Li Jiachun's unusual actions and came to him for advice. He explained the relationship between rainfall and the atmosphere to the masses and mobilized them to carry water to fight the drought. The villagers said, "After all, he is literate and knows more things."

Li Jiachun became a strong assistant to the cadres: helping the township head write summary reports, helping the people's school teacher prepare lessons, and assisting in filling out voter certificates.

When he first came out of school, he was unwilling to live in the countryside. In his opinion, farming was just a rough job that did not require any cultural knowledge. But now his understanding has changed. He realized that farming requires knowledge, and requires knowledge in many areas.

After realizing this, he was determined to dedicate his youth to agricultural production and diligently learn how to use plows and bulldozers. He also often applied the knowledge he had learned from books in the past to production, using scientific methods for seed soaking and preventing pests and diseases.

One day, many students from Pingdu County, Shandong Province, went to visit Li Jiachun and asked him to talk about his feelings after participating in agricultural production. He said, "Students, study hard! Serving the people is glorious, but don't despise agricultural production. Don't follow the detours I once took."

A Good Example for Zhuang Youth in Western Guangxi

Although Li Shanming had studied in junior high school, he seemed like an expert when it came to farming. Last spring, he led the mutual aid team to reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area. In the autumn, when crops were hit by drought and pests, he led the mutual aid team to carry water to fight the drought and eliminate pests. Under his influence, more than two hundred large and small canals were built throughout the township, and more than twenty waterwheels were repaired, ensuring a good harvest.

Li Shanming is an excellent propagandist. He can actively and patiently promote the socialist future of agriculture to farmers. Under his leadership, the first agricultural production cooperative and three perennial mutual aid teams in the county were established. He was supported by the local people of all ethnic groups, and he was elected as a production model in Fengshan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The local people's love for Li Shanming further strengthened his determination to engage in agricultural production. Recently, at his suggestion, the agricultural cooperative ordered books on agricultural production technology in order to learn from the production experience of various regions and scientific knowledge related to production, improve production, and build the mountainous area more beautifully.

"With my single hands, how could I have such a good harvest!"

When Yang Jinquan is mentioned, the farmers in Dongnan Township all praise him, saying: This child did not study in vain. His production and work are all good. He is nineteen years old this year and is from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. After graduating from senior primary school during the summer vacation last year, he stayed at home to participate in agricultural production.

Yang Jinquan's family has seven acres and seven fen of land, of which one acre and three fen is of very poor quality. He broke the township's custom and, last spring, he and his mother carried sixty loads of pond mud to the field and also added pig manure. At the autumn harvest, they harvested two thousand three hundred and sixty jin, exceeding the production of the previous year. His mother happily said to people, "If it weren't for this child at home, with my single hands, how could I have such a good harvest!"

Usually, he can actively respond to the call of the People's Government. For example, last year, rice in the township was infested with rice borers. According to the instructions of the township People's Government, he mobilized the young people in the mutual aid team to use moth traps in the fields to catch rice borers. During the autumn harvest and winter plowing production, he often walked in front of everyone, conducting propaganda and education for the farmers.

Now, Yang Jinquan has become a member of the Communist Youth League.

A Good Accountant for the Agricultural Production Cooperative

Ye Guoliang is the accountant of the Dongta Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in District One, Minhou County, Fujian Province. This year, the number of cooperative members has expanded from seventeen households to twenty-five households, so the work seems more complicated than before. However, Ye Guoliang's accounts are still clear and accurate. On the contract work sheet, it is clearly written: plowing, topdressing, making field ridges, transplanting rice seedlings, harrowing grass, etc. Under each item, the labor hours spent are carefully recorded; what is "receipts" and what is "payments" are also written neatly, making it clear at a glance.

Ye Guoliang is not a graduate of a specialized school, but only studied for a few years in a junior high school. The reason why he does accounting work so well is mainly because he loves the cooperative and loves labor. Usually, in addition to doing accounting work, he also helps everyone learn culture and teaches the members how to use the abacus. He also actively participates in labor and humbly learns the techniques of transplanting rice seedlings from everyone. Now, he can participate in carrying manure and harvesting rice just like adults.

Meng Qingyun Loves Labor

Meng Qingyun was born into a poor peasant family in the suburbs of Benxi City. After liberation, the new life brought her hope, and she finished six years of courses in five years. After graduating from elementary school, life put forward new questions to her: "How should I welcome the new life? Should I continue my studies, or should I stay at home and participate in production?" She often considered this question in her mind, but could not find a solution.

The village Party branch held a meeting calling on young people to participate in agricultural production. After listening to the words of the branch secretary, she decided to stay in the village and engage in production.

However, everything had to be learned from scratch. For example, when sowing seeds, she didn't know how to spread the seeds evenly. She often said to herself: "I have to stand up straight and not let the masses laugh at me." She humbly learned from the old farmers. When others rested, she experimented in the fields. When learning to step on the grid, because her feet were small and she couldn't step well, she put on her father's shoes and stuffed them with grass.

Now, Meng Qingyun has been rated as a production model in Benxi City, and her name is familiar to the young people of the city. Many young people have written to her, expressing their desire to learn her excellent quality of loving labor.

A Capable Female Mutual Aid Team Leader

Liu Jinhua is nineteen years old this year and is from Fangjia Village, District Two, Lushun City. After graduating from elementary school, she joined the mutual aid team. During the autumn harvest, she was good at harvesting, loading, and unloading. When planting autumn wheat, she also learned how to twist seeds and apply manure, and was as good as a young man.

During the Spring Festival this year, the rural areas rectified the mutual aid teams. The team members said, "This year is different from previous years. We must properly rectify the work of the team and re-elect the mutual aid team leader." At that time, everyone felt that Liu Jinhua was capable of both labor and calculation, and unanimously elected her as the mutual aid team leader.

After the Spring Festival, the mutual aid team began to deliver manure. In addition to applying and unloading manure, she also learned to drive a cart.

The village's cultural study class collapsed after the Spring Festival this year due to an unconsolidated foundation. The village cadres entrusted the task of organizing the study class to her and her classmate Zhao Xiuying. After accepting the task, they mobilized the masses to participate in the study, door to door. The study class was restored, but there were no teachers, so the two of them became teachers in the cultural class. Because they carefully prepared their lessons and taught conscientiously, the students had a high learning enthusiasm and maintained a 90% attendance rate.

She does not fall behind in any work. She joined the village drama troupe and performed "A Good Life Depends on Industrialization." She often leads team members to the mountains to plant trees, catch pine tree insects, and so on. She said: "Several months of labor have made me realize that labor is glorious in the new society."

    积极参加农业生产的小学毕业生
    品学兼优的好庄员
    去年，旅大市第一个集体农庄——友谊果园集体农庄成立时，高小毕业生耿玉香和她全家人一起加入了农庄。
    耿玉香加入了农庄以后，看见庄员们愉快的劳动，受到了很大的感动。她在农庄里先后做过果树清扫、刮树皮、刷保护剂和消毒剂等工作。活是很重的，她干得可有劲，从来不误一个工。农庄里举办了苏联集体农庄的照片展览，她看过后，心里很羡慕苏联农民的幸福生活，可是她也想到这种生活并不是轻易得来的。她说：“咱们和苏联相比较虽然还差的远，但是只要咱们向苏联学习，努力劳动，将来也会像苏联人民一样的幸福。”
    县里技术指导站的技术员经常到农庄去，最近还有北京农业大学的教授和学生，来到农庄研究病虫害。她经常接近他们，向他们学习。她的虚心学习和好问的精神，博得了大家的称赞。休息时间，别的女孩子都玩去了，她却蹲在地上仔细地从土中找虫子的土茧。区上举办的“技术训练班”，她也参加了。她懂得了多种虫子的发育过程。
    在业余学校里，她是一个品学兼优的学员：从来不缺席，学习成绩一向是五分；又肯帮助别人。在她耐心帮助下，学习很差的李桂芝很快进步了。在生产队里她能服从领导的分配，在班级里她又非常尊敬老师，因此大家都喜爱耿玉香。
  “不要走我曾经走过的弯路！”
    李嘉存去年在高小毕业的时候，正逢天气干旱，村里许多农户都种不上小麦。很多人存着“靠天吃饭”的思想，等天下雨。可是李嘉存不信什么“靠天吃饭”的鬼话，他挑水浇地，种上了小麦。人们看到李嘉存这种异乎寻常的行动，都来向他讨教；他就向群众说明下雨和大气的关系，动员群众挑水抗旱。村里的人说：“到底是识字的人，懂得事情就多。”
    李嘉存成了干部们的有力助手：帮助乡长写总结报告，帮助民校教师备课，协助填写选民证。
    刚从学校出来的时候，他不愿意过农村生活，在他看来，种庄稼只是一种粗活儿，不需要什么文化知识。可是现在他的认识改变了，他了解到种庄稼需要知识，而且需要多方面的知识。
    认识了这一点以后，他就下决心把自己的青春献给农业生产事业，用心学习使用铧犁，推土车。他还常把过去书本上学习到的知识运用到生产中，用科学的方法进行浸种，防止病虫害。
    有一天，山东省平度县里许多学生去探望李嘉存，请他谈谈自己参加农业生产以后的感想。他说：“同学们，好好学习吧！为人民服务是光荣的，可不要轻视农业生产，不要走我曾经走过的弯路。”
    桂西僮族青年的好榜样
    李善明虽在初级中学读过书，可是干起庄稼活来满像个内行人。去年春天，他领导互助组开垦了荒地，扩大了耕地面积。秋天，庄稼遭到旱灾、虫灾，他又领导互助组挑水抗旱，扑灭虫害。在他的影响下，全乡兴修了大小水渠二百多条，又修置二十多架水车，保证了丰收。
    李善明是一个出色的宣传员。他能积极、耐心地向农民宣传农业的社会主义前途。在他的带领下，成立了全县第一个农业生产合作社和三个常年互助组。他受到了当地各族人民的拥护，他被选为广西省桂西僮族自治区凤山县的生产模范。
    当地人民群众对李善明的爱戴，使他更坚定了从事农业生产的决心。最近，在他的建议下，农业合作社订购了有关农业生产技术的书籍，以便学习各地的生产经验和有关生产的科学知识，提高生产，把山区建设得更美丽。
  “靠我单人双手，那里会有这样好的收成！”
    提起杨锦全，洞南乡的农民都称赞说：这孩子没有白受教育，生产、工作样样都不错。他今年十九岁，广东省新会县人。去年暑期高小毕业后，他就留在家里参加农业生产。
    杨锦全家有七亩七分地，其中一亩三分地土质很不好。他打破了乡里的惯例，去年春天和母亲挑了六十担塘泥上在地里；又加上了猪粪。秋收时，收到两千三百六十斤，超过了前年的产量。他的母亲欢喜地对人说：“不是这孩子在家，靠我单人双手，那里会有这样好的收成！”
    平时，他能积极响应人民政府的号召。例如去年乡里禾稻发生了螟害，他根据乡人民政府的指示，动员互助组里的青年到田里用诱蛾灯捕捉螟蛾。在秋收冬耕生产中，他常常走在大家前面，对农民群众进行宣传教育。
    现在，杨锦全已经成为一个青年团员。
    农业生产合作社的好会计
    叶国良是福建省闽侯县一区东塔村农业生产合作社的会计。今年，合作社的社员由十七户扩大到二十五户，因此工作显得比以前复杂了。可是叶国良的账本依然记得一清二楚的。在包工单上清楚地写着：犁田、追肥、做田塍、插秧、耙草等项，在每项下面又仔细地记着所花去的人工；那是“收方”，那是“付方”，也写得整整齐齐，使人们看起来一目了然。
    叶国良并不是专科学校的毕业生，只在一个初级中学读过几年书，他做会计工作所以做得那样好，主要是由于他热爱合作社、热爱劳动。平时，他除了做会计工作以外，还帮助大家学习文化，教社员们打算盘。他也积极参加劳动，虚心地向大伙学习插秧的技术。现在，他能和成人一样参加挑粪和割稻。
      孟庆云热爱劳动
    孟庆云出身在本溪市郊区的一个贫农家里。解放以后，新的生活给她带来了希望，她以五年的时间读完了六年的课程。小学毕业以后，生活又对她提出了新的问题：“应该怎样来迎接新的生活？升学呢，还是留在家里参加生产？”她脑子里经常考虑这个问题，得不到解决。
    村党支部曾召开了一次会议，号召青年们参加农业生产工作。她听了支部书记的话，决心留在村里从事生产。
    可是，什么事都得从头学起。例如，播种时她不懂得怎样把种籽撒得匀匀的。她常常对自己说：“要挺起腰来，不能让群众笑话”。她虚心向老农学习，当别人休息的时候，他在地里试验。学习踩格子时，因为她脚小踩不好，她就穿上她父亲的鞋子，里面塞上草。
    现在，孟庆云已被评为本溪市的生产模范，她的名字已为全市青年群众所熟悉。许多青年都写信给她，表示要学习她那种热爱劳动的优良品质。
      一个能干的女互助组长
    刘金花今年十九岁，旅顺市第二区方家村人。小学毕业后，她就参加了互助组，在秋收中，收割、装车、卸车干得满好。种秋麦时，她又学会了捻种、下粪，顶个小伙子用。
    今年春节期间，农村整顿互助组。组员们说：“今年跟往年不同了，我们要好好整顿一下组里的工作，改选互助组长。”当时大家都觉得刘金花能劳动又能算，一致推选她当互助组组长。
    春节后，互助组开始送粪了。她除了上粪卸粪之外，还学着赶车。
    村里的文化学习班，由于基础不巩固，今年春节后就垮台了。村干部就把组织学习班的任务交给了她和她的同班毕业生赵秀英。她们接受工作任务以后，便挨门挨户动员群众参加学习。学习班恢复了，但没有教师，她俩就担任了文化班的教师。由于她俩细心准备功课、认真教课，学员学习情绪很高，保持了百分之九十的到课率。
    她在各项工作中都不落后。她参加了村剧团，演出了“好生活依靠工业化”。她经常带领组员到山上去栽树，捉松树虫子等。她说：“几个月的劳动使我体会到，在新社会里劳动是光荣的。”
