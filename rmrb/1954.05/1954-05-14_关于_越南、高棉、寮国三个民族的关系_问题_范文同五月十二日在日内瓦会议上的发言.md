    The task of the Geneva Conference is to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Indochina.

    The three countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos on the Indochinese Peninsula form a unified whole geographically and have mutual relations in all aspects. In their war of aggression against our three countries, the French colonialists exploited this situation, using one country as a base to invade another. From 1862 to 1893, during the first war of aggression by the French colonialists in Indochina, they first occupied southern Vietnam, then used southern Vietnam as a springboard to expand their aggression into Cambodia and southern Indochina, and then advanced northward from there, occupying central and northern Vietnam; Vietnam and Cambodia then became bases for French aggression against Laos.

    The French colonialists took advantage of the close relations between the three countries of Indochina to establish the same rule throughout Indochina, while dividing Indochina into five regions to implement their "divide and rule" policy.

    After World War II, in their war to re-invade the Indochinese Peninsula, the French colonialists still followed this old path: they first occupied southern Vietnam, then sent paratroopers from there to attack southern Cambodia and Laos, and then used the southern Indochina region as a base to launch aggression against the northern Indochina region. For the past seven or eight years, in many battles, they have transferred troops from one country to another, attacking from one country to another, always treating Indochina as a unified battlefield.

    In the struggle against foreign aggressors, the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have united to defend their homelands. When the French colonialists began their aggression against southern Vietnam, Vietnamese and Cambodians who grew up there armed themselves and organized volunteer armies to resist the enemy. At the same time, Vietnamese and Cambodian patriots cooperated closely to fight the common enemy. Since the French colonialists occupied and ruled Indochina, the three nationalities have continuously and mutually responded to each other, launching national liberation movements against the common enemy.

    In the current war of resistance against the French colonialists' re-occupation of Indochina, this unity has become even closer. Everyone knows that in some areas of southern Vietnam, there are more Cambodians than Vietnamese, while in Cambodia there are 300,000 overseas Vietnamese. This explains why in the armed organizations in southern Vietnam, Vietnamese and Cambodians fight side by side, and in the armed organizations in Cambodia, Cambodians and Vietnamese also fight side by side. In Laos, a small number of Vietnamese are distributed everywhere; they participated in the Laotian people's uprisings and have joined the Laotian army since the beginning of the Laotian war of resistance.

    The spirit of solidarity and mutual assistance among the three nationalities is growing day by day.

    On March 11, 1951, the representative conference of the national united fronts of our three countries clearly declared that the three nationalities would fight against imperialist aggressors on the basis of voluntariness, equality, mutual assistance, and mutual respect for sovereignty, striving for the peace, independence, unity, and democracy of the three nationalities.

    The people of Cambodia and Laos, like the people of Vietnam, have united closely and waged heroic struggles against the imperialist aggressors; in the war of resistance, they have achieved great successes in the construction of the People's Liberation Army and the war of resistance government, which governs a vast territory.

    Our conference is to restore peace in Indochina, so when considering and resolving this issue, we must base ourselves on facts and on the real situation.

    Not basing ourselves on facts, not basing ourselves on the real situation, but only imagining that the national liberation movements and war of resistance of the people of Cambodia and Laos are activities of "foreign troops" is a groundless and impractical way to resolve the issue of restoring peace in the three countries of Indochina.

### 关于“越南、高棉、寮国三个民族的关系”问题——范文同五月十二日在日内瓦会议上的发言

    关于“越南、高棉、寮国三个民族的关系”问题
    ——范文同五月十二日在日内瓦会议上的发言
    日内瓦会议的任务是在承认印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上，在印度支那恢复和平。
    印度支那半岛上的越南、高棉、寮国三个国家在地理上是一个统一的整体，在各方面都具有着相互的关系。法国殖民者在侵略我们三个国家的战争中，利用了这一情势，曾以这一个国家为基地去侵略另一个国家。自一八六二年至一八九三年，在法国殖民者第一次侵占印度支那的战争中，他们首先侵占了越南的南部，再以越南南部为跳板向高棉及印度支那南部地区扩大侵略，然后从那里向北推进，侵占越南的中部与北部；越南与高棉又变成了法国侵略寮国的基地。
    法国殖民者利用印度支那三个国家之间的密切关系，在印度支那全境建立了同样的统治，同时把印度支那分成为五个地区，实现其“分而治之”的政策。
    第二次世界大战后，在它再度侵略印度支那半岛的战争中，法国殖民者仍旧是走这一条老路：他们先侵占越南南部，再从那里派伞兵向高棉与寮国南部地区进攻，其后，以印度支那南部地区为基地，向印度支那北部地区发动侵略。七、八年来，在多次战役中，他们从这一个国家把军队转运到另一个国家，从这一个国家向另一个国家进攻，总是把印度支那看做一个统一的战场。
    在反对外来侵略者的斗争中，越南、高棉、寮国人民是团结起来保卫祖国的。当法国殖民者开始向越南南部进行侵略时，越南人与生长在当地的高棉人便武装起来组织成义勇军抗击敌人。同时，越南与高棉的爱国者们密切配合，对共同敌人进行战斗。自从法国殖民者占领并统治了印度支那以后，三个民族便连续不断地、互相呼应地掀起了反对共同敌人的民族解放运动。
    在目前反对法国殖民者再度侵占印度支那的抗战中，这一团结已更加紧密。谁都知道，在越南南部的一些地区，高棉人比越南人还要多，而在高棉却有着三十万越侨。这就说明了为什么在越南南部的武装组织中，有越南人与高棉人并肩作战，而在高棉的武装组织中，也有高棉人与越南人并肩作战。在寮国，到处都分布着一小部分越南人；他们曾参加了寮国人民的起义，而且自寮国抗战之日起，便加入了寮国军队。
    三个民族的团结互助精神正在日益增长。
    一九五一年三月十一日，我们三个国家的民族统一战线代表会议曾明确宣布三个民族在自愿、平等、互助与互相尊重主权的基础上，对帝国主义侵略者进行斗争，争取三个民族的和平、独立、统一与民主。
    高棉、寮国的人民与越南人民一样，已紧密地团结起来，对帝国主义侵略者进行英勇的斗争；他们在抗战中，在人民解放军与抗战政府的建设中均获得了巨大的成就，抗战政府管辖着广大的国土。
    我们的这次会议是要在印度支那恢复和平，因而在考虑与解决这一问题时，我们要依据事实，依据现实情况。
    不依据事实，不依据现实情况，只凭幻想说高棉、寮国人民的民族解放运动与抗战是“外国军队”的活动，这是解决在印度支那三国恢复和平问题中的一种既无基础又不切实际的办法。
