Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Children across the country are writing letters to the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the eve of the "June 1st" Children's Day, expressing their condolences and gratitude to the PLA for loyally defending the motherland and their happy lives.

	Guo Rufa, a student from Class Four of Chuxiong Normal School in Yunnan Province, said in a letter to a certain PLA unit: When we can sit quietly in classrooms with glass windows to study, and when we can lie on soft beds to sleep, we can't help but think of the PLA uncles guarding the motherland's coast. Because the learning environment and happy life we have is inseparable from your heroic and diligent defense of the motherland. He also attached a photo of himself to the letter, with the words "Dedicated to Relatives" written on it.

	Twenty-six Young Pioneers from Gaojiatang Primary School in the Liuyi Township of Benzhong District, Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, sent their most beloved "red scarves" to the PLA, saying in a letter: When the uncles see the "red scarves," they will think of us children, and they will more bravely eliminate the enemies who invade our country and defend us.

	All the children in the fourth grade of Fengcheng Primary School in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, wrote letters to the PLA, reporting their academic achievements to the PLA uncles. Lei Hainan also wrote a special letter to Shen Yashui, the combat hero of Dongshan Island, saying: "Dear Uncle Shen Yashui: How are you? We miss you all the time. In the Battle of Dongshan Island, you shot down an enemy plane and captured fifteen Chiang Kai-shek paratroopers with Uncle Wu Yufu. These heroic deeds quickly spread throughout our school, and everyone was very happy. Uncle Shen Yashui, under your protection, our lives are very happy. We thank you and hope you will take good care of the motherland's ocean. If the enemy dares to invade our lovely motherland, please be sure to wipe them out."

    全国各地儿童纷纷写信慰问解放军叔叔
   【新华社二十八日讯】全国各地儿童在“六一”儿童节前夕纷纷写信给中国人民解放军，对解放军忠诚保卫祖国和他们的幸福生活，表示慰问和感谢。
    云南省楚雄师范学校四班学生郭汝发在写给解放军某部的信上说：当我们能安静地坐在装着玻璃窗子的教室里进行学习的时候，当我们能躺在柔软的床上睡眠的时候，我们就不禁想到了守卫在祖国海防线上的解放军叔叔。因为，我们所以有这样的学习环境和幸福的生活，是和你们英勇、辛勤地保卫祖国分不开的。他还在信里附上一张自己的照片，上面写着“献给亲人”的字样。
    江苏省武进县奔中区六一乡高家塘小学的二十六名少年先锋队员，将自己最心爱的“红领巾”送给解放军，信上说：叔叔们看到了“红领巾”，就会想到我们小朋友，也就会更英勇地消灭侵犯我国的敌人，保卫我们。
    福建省南安县丰城小学四年级的全体小朋友，每人都给解放军写了一封信，向解放军叔叔汇报自己的学习成绩。雷海南小朋友还特地给东山岛战斗英雄沈亚水写了一封信，信上说：“亲爱的沈亚水叔叔：你好吗？我们时时刻刻都在想念你。在东山岛战斗中，你打下了敌机一架，还和吴裕福叔叔俘掳了十五个蒋匪伞兵。这些英雄事迹很快在我们学校里传开了，大家都感到十分高兴。沈亚水叔叔，在你们的保卫下，我们的生活是十分幸福的。我们谢谢你们，希望你们好好地看守着祖国的海洋，假如敌人敢来侵犯我们可爱的祖国，请你们一定把它消灭光。”
