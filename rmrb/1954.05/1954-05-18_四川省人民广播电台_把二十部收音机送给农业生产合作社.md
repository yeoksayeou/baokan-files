    Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station
    Donates Twenty Radios to Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Recently, the Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station manufactured twenty portable, dry-cell powered five-tube radios and distributed them to twenty agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the province. Counties that have already received radios have also sent cadres to the cooperatives to teach installation and maintenance methods, and to help cooperative members establish listening agreements.
    On April 27th, the Zunsheng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Santai County received a radio donated by the broadcasting station. That evening, all the cooperative members gathered in the courtyard of the office to listen to the broadcast, hearing the news, speeches, Sichuan opera, and songs. They listened for more than two hours, and everyone was reluctant to leave. Cooperative member Wang Guili said, "It's not easy to have cultural entertainment in the countryside. I never thought the cooperative would have a big show every day!" Deputy Director Wang Daren said, "The radio gives us political lessons every day, which will make our work much easier."

    四川省人民广播电台
    把二十部收音机送给农业生产合作社
    四川省人民广播电台最近制造了二十部携带方便、用干电池的五灯收音机，分送给全省二十个农业生产合作社。已经收到收音机的各县还派干部到社里去教授安装、保管方法，并帮助社员订立收听公约。
    三台县尊胜农业生产合作社在四月二十七日，收到了广播电台送来的一部收音机。当天晚上，全社社员围在办公室的大院子里收听广播，听了新闻，又听演讲，还听川戏、唱歌。一直听了两个多钟头，大家还恋恋不肯散去。社员王贵立说：“乡坝头来次文化娱乐好不容易，想不到合作社天天有了大戏！”副社长王达仁说：“收音机天天给我们上政治课，工作就会好搞得多。”
