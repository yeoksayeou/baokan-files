Various regions are attaching importance to hog production, and plans to increase hog production are being formulated. As of now, the North China region has proposed a plan to increase hog production by 25% compared to last year, the East China region plans to increase by 17%, the Northeast region plans to add more than 1.7 million hogs, the Central South region plans to increase by 8%, and the Southwest region plans to increase by 7% (of which Sichuan Province alone plans to increase by about 1 million hogs). The eastern region of Inner Mongolia plans to increase by more than 100,000 hogs, all exceeding the requirements originally proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture. The hog increase plans for other regions are also being formulated. The Southwest region requires state-owned farms to raise one pig for every 3 to 5 mu of land, and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams should increase the average number of pigs raised per household by half a pig based on the current level. The Northeast region requires each farmer to raise an average of one to one and a half pigs, each agricultural production cooperative to raise one to two sows, and demonstration farms to be responsible for breeding boars and reproduction tasks. Shanxi requires state-owned farms to raise one pig for every 30 mu of land, and those with the conditions should strive to raise more. Agricultural production cooperatives should raise an average of one pig per household, and collective catering units of agencies, organizations, schools, and enterprises should raise one pig for every 30 people.

While formulating hog increase plans, various regions are taking measures to solve the problem of pig feed: on the one hand, organizing the supply of coarse grains and bran, and on the other hand, supplying oil cakes as feed to various regions to change farmers' habit of directly applying oil cakes as fertilizer. For example, Shandong Province has supplied nearly 400,000 jin of soybean cake and peanut cake to pig-producing areas. In addition, various regions are also paying attention to opening up new feed bases. The East China Regional Finance Committee held a pig and livestock feed conference, proposing to mobilize the masses to find wild feed and advocating the use of idle land to plant feed crops. It is estimated that if each farmer uses one mu of idle land to plant a feed crop once, the region can increase more than 2 billion jin of feed. Various regions have also strengthened the work of hog purchasing and pre-purchasing. Anhui Provincial Food Company purchased a total of 180,000 hogs in the first quarter, and plans to pre-purchase 150,000 hogs in the second quarter with a deposit of 15 billion yuan. China Food Company's Central South Regional Company relies on cooperatives to purchase and pre-purchase hogs from farmers. For hogs weighing more than 70 jin, the company provides pig farmers with loans of 30% to 50% through cooperatives. China Food Company's Shandong Provincial Company entrusted cooperatives to pre-purchase more than 480,000 hogs from farmers from April to the end of November. These measures have encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs.

    各地制订计划积极增殖毛猪
    各地重视毛猪生产，增殖毛猪的计划正在制订中。截至目前为止，华北区已提出比去年增殖毛猪百分之二十五的计划，华东区计划增殖百分之十七，东北区计划增加一百七十余万只，中南区计划增殖百分之八，西南区计划增殖百分之七，（其中只是四川省就计划增殖一百万只左右），内蒙古东部地区计划增殖十余万只，都超过了农业部原来提出的要求。其他各地的增殖计划也正在制订中。西南区要求国营农场每三至五亩地养一只猪，农业生产合作社和互助组要在现有水平上平均每户增养半只猪。东北区要求平均每个农户养成一至一只半，每个农业生产合作社养一至二只母猪，示范农场负责饲养种猪和配种繁殖的任务。山西要求国营农场每三十亩地养一只猪，有条件者力争多养，农业生产合作社平均每户要养一只猪，机关、团体、学校、企业的集体伙食单位平均每三十人养猪一只。
    各地在制订增殖毛猪计划的同时，采取措施解决猪的饲料问题：一方面组织粗粮、糠麸的供应，另一方面向各地供应油饼作饲料，改变农民用油饼直接施肥的习惯。如山东省已供应产猪区豆饼、花生饼近四十万斤。此外，各地并注意开辟新的饲料基地。华东区财委召开的猪畜饲料会议，提出发动群众寻找野生饲料，并提倡利用休闲地种植饲料作物。据估计，如每一农户利用一亩休闲地种一次饲料作物，全区就可增加二十多亿斤饲料。各地对毛猪收购预购工作，也已加强。安徽省食品公司第一季度共收购毛猪十八万只，第二季度计划再以一百五十亿元的定金，预购毛猪十五万只。中国食品公司中南区公司依靠合作社向农民收购、预购毛猪，凡是七十斤重以上的毛猪，公司通过合作社给予养猪户百分之三十至五十的贷款。中国食品公司山东省公司委托合作社向农民预购的毛猪，从四月份到十一月底共达四十八万多只。这些措施鼓舞了农民的养猪情绪。
