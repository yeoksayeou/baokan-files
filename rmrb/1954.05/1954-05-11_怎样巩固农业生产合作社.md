How to Consolidate Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Shao Xing, Deputy Commissioner of Xingtai Special District, Hebei Province

    By the end of March this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Xingtai Special District, Hebei Province, had reached 2,628 (including 258 old cooperatives), with 48,733 participating farm households, accounting for 6.6% of the total number of households in the district. The land entered into the cooperatives amounted to 588,528 mu, accounting for 5.41% of the district's cultivated area. All districts in the special district have established cooperatives, and 81% of the townships have cooperatives; among them, there are two districts that have basically achieved cooperativization and thirty cooperativized townships. There are two agricultural production cooperatives with complete socialist characteristics (Zhangcun in Shahe County and Shuimen in Xingtai County); twenty large cooperatives with more than 100 households; and 120 cooperatives with 50 to 100 households. The number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased more than ninefold compared to the past. The current urgent task is to strengthen the leadership of the existing agricultural production cooperatives and strive to consolidate each of them.
    Generally speaking, the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives in Xingtai Special District this spring has implemented the policy of "active leadership, steady progress." However, some cadres in some counties and districts do not have a deep understanding of the Party's class line and mutual aid and cooperation policies in rural work, and they also lack experience in leading cooperative establishment. Therefore, some problems that hinder the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives have occurred in some places in various counties. From the perspective of the entire special district, the more common problems currently existing in the work of establishing cooperatives are: (1) Lack of political education work, and some cooperatives and cooperative members do not have a clear understanding of the direction of progress. (2) The policy of relying on the poor peasants and the solid alliance of the middle peasants is not implemented enough. In cooperatives with many middle peasants, the middle peasants exclude the poor peasants; in cooperatives with many poor peasants, the middle peasants are unwilling to participate. Some cooperatives did not take good care of the fertility of the land during land valuation, the pricing of farm tools and livestock was unfair, and the labor scoring was inappropriate. (3) The management work was not done well. Some leading cadres of cooperatives lack a democratic style, cannot give play to the enthusiasm of all cooperative members, and there is even a phenomenon of wasted work. Some cooperatives only give male cooperative members "base points," which hinders the development of women's production enthusiasm and violates the principle of mutual benefit. Many cooperatives lack accountants, and the accounts are chaotic. According to statistics, 15% of the cooperatives in the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Shahe still do not have accountants and keep accounts "based on conscience." Some cooperatives, although they have accountants, do not know how to keep accounts. For example, the accountant of a cooperative in Dongjiacun, Shahe, kept accounts by marking the door panels of his house, marking income on the east door panel and expenses on the west door panel; hundreds of thousands and millions of yuan of income and expenses were recorded in this way, and the cooperative members were very worried about making mistakes. Some cooperatives acted beyond their capabilities, depreciating livestock and farm tools too much into the cooperative; some built public houses too early, and the burden on cooperative members was too heavy. If these problems are not seriously resolved, they will not only hinder the current spring plowing and production work, but also have a significant impact on the consolidation of each cooperative.
    In order to consolidate the established agricultural production cooperatives, these problems must be distinguished between major and minor, urgent and less urgent, and active measures must be taken to solve them actively and steadily in combination with production work. How to solve these problems?
    (1) We must strengthen the Party's ideological leadership, strengthen socialist education for cooperative members, and raise the awareness of cooperative members. The problems existing in the cooperatives are extremely complex and diverse; for these problems, we must analyze them fundamentally. At present, the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives are collective economies of a semi-socialist nature established on the basis of private ownership. There is a contradiction between private and public ownership within them, but it must also be recognized that they are a unity of opposites. Judging from the current situation in Xingtai Special District, from a broad perspective, the vast majority of cooperative members in the district are following the Communist Party and striving to realize a common prosperous socialist society. However, specifically speaking, the immediate interests and personal interests of the cooperative members are different; many of the plans made by the cooperative members based on personal interests and immediate interests are inconsistent with the interests of socialism and the interests of the entire agricultural production cooperative. Therefore, to consolidate the existing agricultural production cooperatives, we must strengthen the Party's leadership, continuously carry out political and ideological education, and raise the socialist awareness of cooperative members.
    The cooperative led by Gao Gaizi in Kongcun, Nanhe County, has a total of 24 households. In 1952, these households harvested an average of 135 jin of wheat per mu; after the establishment of the cooperative in 1953, they harvested an average of 207 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of the mutual aid group in the same village in the same year (an average of 180 jin per mu) by 15%, and exceeding the yield of the individual households in the same village in the same year (an average of 90 jin per mu) by 130%. However, due to the lack of serious leadership from the county and district committees, and the village branch did not carry out socialist political and ideological education for the cooperative members, the cooperative members were not clear about the development prospects of the agricultural production cooperative; although production increased, 19 of the 24 households withdrew from the cooperative after last autumn. A newly established cooperative in Putongdian, Shahe, also had many households who were afraid of suffering losses during the establishment of the cooperative because the political and ideological education work was weak and sold the grass for feeding livestock; now, 9 of the 21 households in the cooperative have withdrawn. The branch leaders in Xiaolvzhai, Julu, and Zhangcun, Shahe, are strong and pay special attention to the political education work of the cooperative members. The socialist awareness of the cooperative members has been generally improved, and the agricultural production cooperative has been consolidated.
    (2) We must continue to implement the Party's class line in the countryside—"rely on the solid alliance of the poor peasants and the middle peasants, gradually develop mutual aid and cooperation, and restrict the exploitation of the rich peasants." This is also an important guarantee for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. Now, some cooperative members actually feel that they have suffered losses by joining the cooperative. However, in the atmosphere of "the general trend is that it doesn't matter if you suffer a little loss," some people feel that they have suffered losses but do not say anything, fearing that people will say they are backward. They keep it in their hearts, and after a long time, they cannot bear it, and they will still withdraw from the cooperative. Some people do not actually suffer losses, but they cannot figure out the accounts themselves; this requires helping them to figure out the detailed accounts and strengthening ideological education. Some people do suffer more losses and even have to reduce their income compared to the past, which requires solving some specific problems. We have found that some cooperatives use the method of raising the amount of investment to force poor households to withdraw from the cooperative; some cooperatives use the excuse that some poor peasants are "lazy," "second-rate," and "three-handed" and do not allow them to join the cooperative; many cooperatives depreciate livestock and large farm tools into the cooperative and do not pay any reasonable interest until six or seven years later, which makes the middle peasants with more livestock and farm tools dissatisfied; some cooperatives stipulate that the repayment time is very short and the interest is too high, which makes the burden on poor households too heavy; some cooperatives adopt a show of hands to solve problems in the "four evaluations," which makes the middle peasants suffer in cooperatives with many poor peasants, and the poor peasants suffer in cooperatives with many middle peasants; some cooperatives only see that the original landlords and rich peasants who have just changed their composition and joined the cooperative are honest and active for a while and relax their necessary vigilance against them. These are all detrimental to the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. It is necessary to combine the current production activities, use all available opportunities, and repeatedly educate the key members and masses in the cooperative to enhance the unity of the working people, and solve some specific problems that must be solved (mainly correcting unreasonable phenomena in the "four evaluations"). Facts have proved that the cooperatives that paid attention to the issue of unity between poor and middle peasants in the process of establishing cooperatives and "four evaluations" are now relatively consolidated and the production work is also done better; the cooperatives that did not pay attention to this issue and did not handle it well have unstable emotions among the cooperative members and the production work is not done well. One thing must be noted: when dealing with economic problems within the cooperative, the method of the minority obeying the majority cannot be adopted, and problems should be solved through repeated democratic consultation.
    (3) We must train cadres and key members in the cooperative in a planned way so that they can become experts from laymen, so as to solve the difficulty of the increase in new cooperatives and the lack of leadership. Shahe County trained 1,048 county, district, township, and cooperative cadres in two phases in February and March; they learned for a period of time and then worked for a period of time, which solved some important problems that needed to be solved urgently in the cooperative establishment work at that time. Many other counties have also done this; a total of more than 10,000 cadres in the entire special district have been trained. In addition to leading cooperative establishment cadres and key members in the cooperative to study the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies, the main content of this training class is to concentrate the actual problems of each cooperative, grasp the main ones, and solve them through in-depth discussions under leadership; and then pass them on through trained personnel and specifically solve the problems existing in the cooperative. In this way, we can lead the cooperatives to continuously improve and raise their standards. It is not possible to adapt to the needs of the increase in new cooperatives by directly leading the establishment of cooperatives only by county and district cadres. The main cadres of the townships are more familiar with the situation of the cooperatives, but they lack a systematic understanding of the mutual aid and cooperation policies; they should be trained in a planned way to make them the main force in leading the establishment of cooperatives at the grassroots level. The district head of the Third District of Shahe led four cadres to the cooperative, learning while working, so that all four people became experts in establishing cooperatives from not knowing much. This method is feasible. In order to solve the problem of the lack of key members in establishing cooperatives, we can also establish mutual aid and cooperation networks in pieces, exchange experience in establishing cooperatives, use old cooperatives to drive new cooperatives, or comprehensively integrate the good experience of new cooperatives, disseminate it, and solve the problems existing in the cooperatives in a timely manner.
    (4) We must conduct trials of increasing production and increasing the income of cooperative members based on the established production plan to increase the enthusiasm of cooperative members. Farmers will only actively work in agricultural production cooperatives voluntarily when they really know that they can increase their actual income. The Zhangcun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shahe conducted a trial calculation. If this year's production plan is realized, the total grain income of the entire cooperative will be 570,000 jin converted into wheat, and the income per labor day can be converted into more than 22 jin of millet. After the cooperative members understood this, they all worked more actively to realize the cooperative's production increase plan, and no one was willing to delay their work. After the Li Huihe-led cooperative in Shangxian Village, Shahe, conducted a trial calculation, they immediately launched a patriotic production increase competition and plowed all the land that the cooperative should cultivate in three days and harrowed it three times. Affected by the cooperative, the masses outside the cooperative in this village cultivated more than 1,900 mu of land in three days. Farmer Wang Shide said: "I have lived for forty years, and I have never seen such a great momentum of production as this year. In the past, we did not go to the fields to work until after the second day of the second month (lunar calendar), but this year we have done most of the spring work before the fifteenth day of the first month." Because the cooperative has clearly demonstrated its superiority in production, the masses outside the cooperative have also begun to admire the cooperative, and the thinking of the cooperative members has become more stable. There are still many cooperatives that have not conducted trial calculations, or in the trial calculations, they only calculated the possible increase in income of the cooperative members, but did not calculate why the output can be increased. The cooperative members are still not very convinced of the possibility of increasing income. They doubt: there are still so many people and so much land, why can every household increase income? It is necessary to calculate clearly to the cooperative members what things have been done after the establishment of the production cooperative and what things will be done that could not be done without the cooperative, from which aspects can the output be increased, so that the cooperative members can feel more practical and know from which aspects to continue to work hard to increase production.
    (5) We must enable the labor force to give full play to its role. Last year, the five agricultural production cooperatives in Jiagou Village, Shahe, collapsed because of improper labor allocation and serious waste of work. This year, most of the cooperatives in Xingtai Special District paid attention to the establishment of production organizations and the formulation of production plans and systems during the establishment of the cooperatives; the cooperative members saw that all activities were for the purpose of increasing production as soon as the cooperative was established, and their thinking was relatively stable. The Liu Qingyun-led cooperative in Dukou Village, Shahe, specifically studied the methods of using labor and animal power in the spring. In addition to ensuring sufficient labor for spring plowing and sowing, it drew 24 people to engage in sideline industries to support agriculture and planned to pad 50 mu of river beach. The cooperative members saw that the labor force was used reasonably, the production was well-organized, and the production channels were increased, with great hope of increasing production and increasing income, so their thinking was focused on increasing production and their labor enthusiasm was high. Now, some cooperatives still have the phenomenon of wasted work, mainly because of the lack of necessary long-term (seasonal) production plans, or because they did not pay attention to production reform and infrastructure construction, and there is nothing for the surplus labor force to do. For the consolidation and improvement of the cooperative, these two problems should also be paid attention to.

    怎样巩固农业生产合作社
    河北省邢台专区副专员　邵星
    河北省邢台专区的农业生产合作社，到今年三月底已发展到二千六百二十八个（其中有老社二百五十八个），参加社的农户达四万八千七百三十三户，占全区总户数的百分之六点六。入社土地五十八万八千五百二十八亩，占全区耕地面积的百分之五点四一。全专区百分之百的区已经办了社，有社的乡占百分之八十一；其中还有两个基本上达到合作化的区，三十个合作化的乡。有两个完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（沙河县章村、邢台县水门）；一百户以上的大社二十个；五十户至一百户的社一百二十个。农业生产合作社的数量已经比过去增加了九倍以上，目前一个迫不容缓的任务就是对现有的农业生产合作社加强领导，争取把它们每一个都巩固起来。
    今春邢台专区发展农业生产合作社的工作，一般地说贯彻了“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针。但是，也有一些县区干部对于党在农村工作中的阶级路线和互助合作政策领会得不深刻，也缺乏领导办社经验；因此，各县都有一些地方发生了有碍于农业生产合作社的巩固的一些问题。从全专区来看，目前在办社工作中比较普遍地存在的问题是：（一）缺乏政治教育工作，一部分社及社员对前进方向没有明确的认识。（二）依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟的政策贯彻得不够。中农多的社，中农排斥贫农；贫农多的社，中农不愿参加。有的社在土地评产时没有很好地照顾土地肥瘦，农具牲畜作价不公，劳力评分不当。（三）经营管理工作没有做好。有些社的领导骨干缺乏民主作风，不能发挥全体社员的积极性，甚至有窝工现象。部分社只给男社员评“底分”，阻碍了妇女生产积极性的发挥，并且违反了互利的原则。不少的社缺乏会计，账目混乱。据统计，沙河第四、第五两区至今还有百分之十五的社没会计，“凭良心”记账。有的社虽说有会计，但不会记账。像沙河东九家村的一个社，会计记账的方法是在他的屋子的门扇上划记号，东门扇上记收入，西门扇上记支出；成十万、百万元的收支都是这样记的，社员们十分担心弄错。有些社不量力而行，牲畜、农具折价归社太多；有的过早盖公用的房舍，社员负担太重。对这些问题，如果不认真地加以解决，不但会妨碍当前的春耕生产工作，并且和各个社的巩固都有重大的关系。
    为了巩固已经建立起来的农业生产合作社，对这些问题必须分清主次缓急，采取积极措施，结合生产工作，积极地稳妥地予以解决。怎样解决这些问题呢？
      （一）要加强党的思想领导，对社员加强社会主义教育，提高社员的觉悟。社内存在的问题是极其复杂多样的；对于这些问题，我们必须从根本上加以分析。当前绝大部分农业生产合作社是在私有基础上建立的半社会主义性质的集体经济，它内部存在着私有、公有的矛盾，同时也必须认识到，他是矛盾的统一体。从邢台专区现时的情况来看，从大的方向上来说，全区绝大部分社员在跟着共产党走，为实现共同富裕的社会主义社会而奋斗这一点上，是一致的。但是，具体地说，社员们的眼前利益和个人利益又是各不相同的；许多社员从个人利益、眼前利益出发所做的一切打算，都是和社会主义的利益、整个农业生产合作社的利益不一致的。因此，要把现有的农业生产合作社巩固起来，必须加强党的领导，不断地进行政治思想教育，提高社员们的社会主义觉悟。
    南和县孔村高改子领导的社，共有二十四户。一九五二年，这些户每亩小麦平均收一百三十五斤；一九五三年建社后，每亩平均收到二百零七斤，超过同村的互助组同年的产量（每亩平均一百八十斤）百分之十五，超过同村的单干户同年的产量（每亩平均九十斤）百分之一百三十。但是，由于县委区委没有认真领导，村支部也没有向社员进行社会主义的政治思想教育，社员对农业生产合作社的发展前途认识不清；虽然增加了生产，去年秋后二十四户中仍有十九户退了社。沙河普通店新成立的一个社，也因为政治思想教育工作薄弱，在建社过程中就有许多户怕自己吃亏，把喂牲口的草卖了；现在，全社二十一户已经退出了九户。巨鹿小吕寨和沙河章村等地的支部领导坚强，特别注意对社员的政治教育工作，社员们的社会主义觉悟普遍提高，农业生产合作社就巩固起来了。
    （二）要继续深入贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线——“依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，逐步发展互助合作，限制富农剥削。”这也是巩固农业生产合作社的重要保证。现在有些社员实际上是感到入社吃了亏的。可是，在“大势所趋，吃点亏沾点光都没有啥关系”的空气里，有些人觉得吃亏也不吭，怕人家说他落后。这样闷在心里，别来别去，日子久了，别不住了，他们还是要退社的。有些人实际上并不吃亏，只是自己算不清账；这就要帮助他们算清细账，并且加强思想教育。有些人确实是吃亏较多，甚至要比过去减少收入，这就必须解决一些具体问题。我们已经发现有的社用抬高投资额的办法，逼贫困户出社；有些社借口某些贫农是“懒汉”、“二流子”、“三只手”，不许他们入社；有许多社牲口大农具作价入社，要六、七年才还，也不给一点合理的利息，使牲口农具多的中农不满；也有的社规定还清的时间很短，利息过高，使贫困户的负担过重；有些社在“四评”中采用举手表决的方式解决问题，贫农多的社，就使中农吃亏，中农多的社，就使贫农吃亏；有些社对于刚改变了成分入了社的原地主、富农分子，只看到他们一时还老实、积极，放松了对他们应有的警惕。这些都是不利于农业生产合作社的巩固的。应当结合当前的生产活动，利用一切可以利用的机会，反复地向社内骨干和群众进行增强劳动农民内部团结的教育，并且解决一些必须解决的具体问题（主要是纠正“四评”中的不合理现象）。事实证明，在建社、“四评”过程中注意了贫中农团结问题的社，现在都比较巩固，生产工作做得也比较好；对这个问题没有注意、处理得不好的社，社员们的情绪就不稳定，生产工作也搞不好。有一点是必须注意的：在处理社内的经济问题时，不能采用少数服从多数的方式，应该经过反复的民主协商来解决问题。
    （三）要有计划地训练干部和社内骨干，使他们由外行变成内行，以解决新社增多、领导力量不足的困难。沙河县在二月和三月分两期训练了县、区、乡、社干部一千零四十八名；学一段，做一段，解决了当时办社工作当中急待解决的一些重要问题。别的许多县也这样做了；全专区已经受过训练的干部总共约一万多人。这种训练班，除领导办社干部和社内骨干学习党的互助合作政策以外，主要内容是把各个社的实际问题集中起来，抓住主要的，通过有领导的深入讨论，予以解决；然后就通过受过训练的人去传授，具体地解决社内存在的问题。这样，就能领导各社不断地改进和提高。仅由县、区干部直接领导办社，是不能适应新社增多的形势需要的。乡主要干部对社的情况比较熟悉，但是对于互助合作政策缺乏系统的认识；应当有计划地培养他们，使他们成为在基层领导办社的主力。沙河第三区区长带领四名干部到社里去，边作边学，使这四个人都由不大懂变成办社的内行，这种办法是可行的。为了解决办社骨干缺乏的问题，还可以分片建立互助合作网，交流办社经验，以老社带动新社，或综合新社的好经验，进行传播，及时解决社内存在的问题。
      （四）要根据已定的生产计划，进行增加生产和增加社员收入的试算，提高社员们的劳动热情。农民在确实知道能增加实际收入的时候，才会自愿地在农业生产合作社里积极劳动。沙河章村农业生产合作社进行了试算，如实现了今年的生产计划，全社收入的粮食折麦五十七万斤，每个劳动日的收入可折合谷子二十二斤多。社员摸清了这个底细后，就都更积极地为实现社的增产计划而努力，谁也不肯耽搁工夫了。沙河尚贤村李会和领导的社，在试算后立即开展爱国增产竞赛，三天就犁完了全社应耕的土地，并耙了三遍。这个村的社外群众在社的影响下，三天耕地一千九百多亩。农民王士德说：“我活了四十岁，没见过像今年这样大的生产劲头。往年过了二月二（夏历）才下地做活，今年不到正月十五就把春季的活做了一大半。”因为社在生产上明显地表现出了优越性，社外的群众也都对社羡慕起来，社员们的思想就更加稳定了。现在还有很多社没有进行试算，或者在试算中只算了社员可能增加的收入，却没有算为什么能增加产量，社员们对于增加收入的可能仍然不很相信，他们怀疑：还是这么多人，这么多地，为什么家家户户都能增加收入呢？必须把成立生产合作社以后办了那些事以及将要办的那些事是没有成社的时候办不到的，从那方面可以增加多少产量，也给社员计算清楚，社员们的心里才能更实在，也才知道该从那些方面继续努力增加生产。
    （五）要使劳动力能充分发挥作用。去年沙河贾沟村的五个农业生产合作社，因为劳力调配不当，窝工现象严重，把社搞垮了。今年邢台专区大部分社在建社中就注意建立生产组织，制定生产计划和制度；社员们见到社一建立起来一切活动就都是为着增产，思想就比较稳定。沙河渡口村刘清云领导的社，具体研究了春季劳力和畜力的使用办法，除保证春耕播种的充足劳力外，抽出了二十四人搞支持农业的副业，并计划垫河滩五十亩。社员们见到劳力使用合理，生产有条不紊，生产门路增多，大有增加生产增加收入的希望，思想就都集中在增产上边，劳动热情高涨起来。现在，有些社仍然有窝工现象，主要原因是缺乏必要的较长时期的（季节的）生产计划，或者没有注意生产改革和基本建设，有剩余劳力没事干。为了社的巩固和提高，这两个问题也应当注意解决。
