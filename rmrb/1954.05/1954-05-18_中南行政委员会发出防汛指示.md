    Central-South Administrative Committee Issues Flood Prevention Instructions
    The Central-South Administrative Committee issued instructions on flood prevention work on the 14th, calling on governments at all levels and the broad masses in the Central-South region to work hard to do a good job in this year's flood prevention work, ensure increased agricultural production, and ensure the safety of some cities, industrial and mining areas, and railway transportation. The instructions put forward several specific requirements for this year's flood prevention work: First, flood prevention work must be closely combined with drought and waterlogging prevention work. When deploying flood prevention work, all localities must simultaneously prepare for drought and waterlogging prevention. During the rainy season, existing irrigation projects should fully store water and conserve water, and strengthen the management and maintenance of various projects, and check the rational use of water for storage and conservation to prevent possible drought after the flood season. Larger dams should have special agencies responsible for management, and all preparations should be made before the flood season to prevent operational failures during use. Strive to do a good job in repairing, assembling, and installing water pumps to facilitate drainage and irrigation. In areas prone to waterlogging, existing drainage systems should be used as much as possible to dredge ditches and vigorously drain waterlogging, so as to reduce the area of waterlogging and enable local farmers to quickly resume production. Second, in areas where mountain floods are prone to occur, active preparations should be made to strengthen prevention. Management should be strengthened, especially in areas where reservoirs have been built. Small water conservancy projects that have been damaged by mountain floods should be seized the opportunity to mobilize farmers to repair them as soon as possible to facilitate water storage and drought prevention. Third, in coastal areas with large rivers and lakes, in addition to paying attention to water conditions, wind and tide prevention work should also be done well. In order to take care of the safety of coastal fishermen and salt workers' production and ship navigation, weather forecasts should be further strengthened to reduce damage.
    The instructions require that the following important measures be implemented in various parts of Central-South: First, flood prevention organizations at all levels should be restored and established immediately, and flood prevention meetings should be convened in advance. Second, water conservancy departments at all levels should closely cooperate with relevant departments such as meteorology, grain, transportation, post and telecommunications, agriculture and forestry under the unified leadership of the local party and government, and provide each other with material and technical support, which is a guarantee for jointly overcoming floods and reducing damage. Third, temporary flood diversion, detention, and storage plans should be carefully prepared. Fourth, ideological investigation, organizational investigation, embankment investigation, and ideological mobilization of cadres and farmers should be carried out before the flood season to ensure the implementation of flood prevention work. Fifth, further strengthen weather forecasting work. Command organizations at all levels should strengthen contact with meteorological departments. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南行政委员会发出防汛指示
    中南行政委员会十四日发出防汛工作指示，号召中南地区各级人民政府和广大群众努力做好今年的防汛工作，保障农业增产和部分城市、工矿区和铁路交通安全。指示提出今年防汛工作中几项具体要求：一、防汛工作必须和防旱防涝工作密切结合进行。各地在布置防汛工作时，必须同时做好防旱防涝的准备工作。现有各种灌溉工程在降雨时期应充分蓄水保水，并加强对各种工程的管理养护和蓄水保水合理用水的检查，预防汛后可能发生的旱象。较大闸坝要有专门机构负责管理，做好汛前一切准备措施，谨防使用时操纵失灵。抽水机要争取做好修配安装工作，以利排水和灌溉。在发生渍涝的地区，应尽量利用现有排水系统，疏通沟渠，大力排出渍水，以缩小渍水面积，使当地农民得以迅速恢复生产。二、在山洪容易暴发的地区，应积极准备，加强防范。特别在做了水库的地区，更应加强管理。被山洪冲毁的小型水利工程，应抓紧时机动员农民从速修复，以利蓄水防旱。三、沿海大江大湖地区，除注意水情外，并应做好防风防潮工作。为照顾沿海渔民、盐民生产和船只航行的安全，更应进一步加强气象预报，以减少损害。
    指示要求中南各地须贯彻如下几项重要措施：一、各级防汛组织机构应即恢复成立，提前召开防汛会议。二、各级水利部门应和有关气象、粮食、交通、邮电、农林等部门，在当地党政统一领导下密切配合进行工作，互相予以物资和技术上的支援，这是共同战胜洪水，减少损害的保证。三、要认真做好临时分洪滞洪和蓄洪的计划。四、应在汛期前做好查思想、查组织、查堤防和对干部、农民群众的思想发动工作，以保证防汛工作的贯彻执行。五、进一步加强气象预报工作。各级指挥机构应加强和气象部门的联系。　　　（新华社）
