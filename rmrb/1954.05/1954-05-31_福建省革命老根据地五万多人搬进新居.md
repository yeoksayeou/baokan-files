Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 28th. Recently, in various old revolutionary base areas of Fujian Province, more than 50,000 people have moved into new homes from mountain caves, bamboo sheds, and dilapidated thatched huts. Over the past year, the Fujian Provincial People's Government has allocated more than 30 billion yuan to help the people of 1,676 villages rebuild their homes. These villages were severely devastated by the enemy during the domestic revolutionary war, and some had become ruins. Now, more than 30,000 newly built and renovated houses have appeared in these villages.
    The people of the old revolutionary base areas who moved into new homes posted red couplets on the doors of their new houses, with phrases such as "New Home Completion, Grateful for the Wise Chairman Mao; Revolutionary Victory, Credit to the Chinese Communist Party" and "Carry Forward Revolutionary Tradition, Strive for Greater Glory." After rebuilding their homes, their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. While rebuilding their homes, the people of the old revolutionary base areas in the Longxi Special District have newly built 119 water conservancy projects and accumulated a large amount of fertilizer to strive for a bumper summer harvest.

    福建省革命老根据地五万多人搬进新居
    【新华社福州二十八日电】在福建省各个革命老根据地，最近有五万多人从山洞、竹棚、破茅屋中搬进了新居。一年多来，福建省人民政府曾拨款三百多亿元帮助一千六百七十六个村的人民重建家园，这些村庄在国内革命战争时期，都曾被敌人严重摧残，有些已成为一片废墟。现在，在这些村庄里已出现了三万多间新建和修整一新的房屋。
    搬进新居的革命老根据地人民在新房子的门上，贴了写着“新居落成恩感英明毛主席，革命胜利功归中国共产党”和“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”等字句的红对联。重建家园后，他们的生产热情更加高涨。龙溪专区革命老根据地人民在重建家园的同时，新修了水利一百十九处，积下大批肥料，争取夏季丰收。
