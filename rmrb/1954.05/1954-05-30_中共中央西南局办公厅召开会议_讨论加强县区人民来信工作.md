    Meeting Held by the General Office of the CCP Central Committee Southwest Bureau
    to Discuss Strengthening People's Letters Work in Counties and Districts

    The General Office of the CCP Central Committee Southwest Bureau convened a meeting on people's letters work of various provinces on May 5th to discuss strengthening people's letters work in counties and districts, in order to further strengthen the Party's ties with the masses. The meeting pointed out that since the struggle against bureaucracy at the end of 1953, the number of people's letters in counties and districts has increased significantly. Sichuan Province alone received 300,000 letters from the people last year, which strengthened the Party's ties with the masses. However, due to the lack of unified leadership and in-depth inspection, the phenomena of simply forwarding letters at each level and backlog and procrastination still exist. Some counties have handled letters in a simplistic manner, resulting in problems not being properly resolved. In order to strengthen the people's letters work in counties and districts, the meeting considered it necessary to closely integrate the handling of letters with various movements and daily work, thereby leveraging the critical supervision role of the masses from the bottom up. At the same time, county committees should strengthen unified leadership over this work, organizing the strength of various departments to jointly handle the letters work. Counties and districts should also assign full-time personnel or designate personnel to manage the work concurrently, establishing necessary systems for registration, approval, inspection, filing, etc., to ensure the timely and correct handling of people's letters.

    中共中央西南局办公厅召开会
    议讨论加强县区人民来信工作
    中共中央西南局办公厅为进一步密切党与群众的联系。于五月五日召开各省人民来信工作会议，讨论加强县、区人民来信工作。会议指出，自一九五三年底反对官僚主义的斗争后，县、区人民来信已增加很多，仅四川省去年即收到人民来信三十万件，密切了党和群众的联系。但是由于缺乏统一领导和深入检查，层层照转和积压拖拉现象仍然存在。有的县处理来信因简单从事，致使问题未得正确解决。为加强县、区人民来信工作，会议认为必须把处理来信工作与各项运动及日常工作密切结合起来，从而发挥群众自下而上的批评监督作用。同时应加强县委对这一工作的统一领导，组织各部门力量共同处理来信工作。县、区并应配备专人或指定专人兼管，建立登记、批办、检查、归档等必要制度，保证人民来信及时正确的处理。
