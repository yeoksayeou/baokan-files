Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 19th: The first batch of steel ingots produced by the No. 2 open-hearth furnace of the newly built steelmaking shop at the state-owned Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant was rolled into flat steel by the steel strip shop on May 15th. This batch of flat steel, used to manufacture the rhombic frames on train cars, will support the economic construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　Flat steel is a new product that the steel strip shop of the No. 101 Steel Plant only successfully trial-produced in March. The workers in the steel strip shop felt it was a great honor to roll steel with the first batch of steel ingots produced by the new steelmaking shop and to support the Korean people with these steels. Before rolling, they carefully inspected the rolling mill and various tools and made various preparations. When Zhang Rongsen, the deputy director of the steel strip shop, gave the order to start rolling, the first piece of steel was successfully produced in just sixty seconds.

    重庆一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场
    首批钢锭轧成扁钢
    【新华社重庆十九日电】国营重庆一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场二号平炉生产的第一批钢锭，已在五月十五日由钢条场轧成扁钢。这批用来制造火车车厢上的菱形架的扁钢，将支援朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的经济建设。
    扁钢是一零一钢铁厂钢条场三月份才试制成功的新产品。钢条场工人们感到用新建炼钢场生产的首批钢锭轧制钢材，并把这些钢材支援朝鲜人民是极大的光荣。在轧制前，他们详细检查了轧钢机和各种工具，做好了各种准备工作。当钢条场副场长张荣森下令开轧后，只过了六十秒钟，第一根钢材就顺利地诞生了。
