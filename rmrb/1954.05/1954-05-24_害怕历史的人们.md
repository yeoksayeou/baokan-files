People Who Fear History
    Hesheng

    Recently, at the Geneva Conference, Western diplomats have repeatedly emphasized not looking back at history when discussing issues. When Mr. Smith heard someone talk about the responsibility for the Korean War, he became irritated. Mr. Bidault also did not want to hear about who sabotaged the Franco-Vietnamese Accords and who launched the Indochina War. Why are Western diplomats afraid to talk about history? Because the true historical facts will expose the colonialists' aggressive nature towards the Asian people.

    The American representative is unwilling to talk about history because historical facts prove that the United States has always harbored ambitions to invade Korea. History records that on May 17, 1950, on the eve of the Korean War, Dulles personally went to South Korea to inspect the Li's puppet army positions concentrated near the 38th parallel. This event is evidenced by a photograph that later appeared in British and American newspapers. In this photo, Dulles is seen in the trenches along the 38th parallel, surrounded by a large group of American and Li's bandit army officers, staring at a map with hungry wolf-like eyes, while someone next to him is holding up binoculars to peer north of the 38th parallel. This historical fact alone demonstrates that the United States was the aggressor who launched the Korean War. The representatives of the United States and Syngman Rhee groundlessly opposed free elections throughout Korea and claimed that South Korea had already held elections. However, history records that in the separate "elections" held in South Korea on May 10, 1948, although South Korean police and terrorists used coercive measures to force voters to vote, less than 30 percent of eligible voters participated in this separate "election." As a result of the "election," the "National Assembly" was established in South Korea. Among the 198 members, 84 were landlords, 32 were capitalists, and 23 were pro-Japanese officials. Through such a "National Assembly," the United States finally pushed Syngman Rhee, an old lackey it had been grooming for more than 30 years, onto the seat of "President." This historical fact exposes that this "election" completely violated the will of the people and shows that the Syngman Rhee puppet regime was fostered single-handedly by the United States. Naturally, it is not in the United States' interest to talk about these historical facts.

    Similarly, on the Indochina issue, historical facts are also unfavorable to French colonialists and American interventionists. Historical facts prove that France has been the brutal ruler of the Indochinese people for nearly a century. History records that during the Japanese occupation of Indochina, the French colonial authorities were always enthusiastic collaborators with the Japanese occupying forces. The French newspaper "Marseillaise" at the time said: "While French senior officials docilely acted as Pétainists, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, fought against Japanese fascism with rare courage." History records that on March 6, 1946, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the French government signed a preliminary agreement in Hanoi, which clearly stipulated that France recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "as a free state, with its government, parliament, army, and finances." History also records that on the evening of December 19 of that year, French colonialists completely tore up the Franco-Vietnamese Accords and launched a large-scale war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. History records that on June 14, 1949, under the manipulation of the French colonial authorities, the "Emperor" Bao Dai made his debut in Saigon, the French-occupied area. At the time, even the British bourgeois magazine "New Statesman" admitted that "Bao Dai only exists with the support of French bayonets." Historical facts record the long-term American interference in the Indochina War. Naturally, these historical facts are not pleasing to Mr. Bidault and Mr. Smith.

    Western diplomats are afraid to talk about history partly because they are afraid of bearing the responsibility for launching wars of aggression, and partly because they intend to erase the historical facts of the Korean and Indochinese people's heroic struggles against aggression. In this way, it is easier for them to deceive public opinion and attempt to obliterate the national rights of the Korean and Indochinese people under the pretext of their fabricated history, so that the Korean and Indochinese issues cannot be resolved peacefully, and Korea and Indochina are dragged onto the path of expanded war and colonial enslavement.

    Hiding one's head in the sand is foolish. Historical facts will not cease to exist just because someone wants to distort them or is unwilling to talk about them. People believe that only by considering historical facts can the Korean and Indochinese issues be resolved realistically. Some people's fear of talking about history can only show that they are deliberately obstructing the Geneva Conference from resolving these important international issues.

    害怕历史的人们
    禾生
    最近在日内瓦会议上，西方的外交官们一再强调在讨论问题时不要回溯历史。史密斯一听到别人谈到关于朝鲜战争的责任问题时就恼火，皮杜尔也不愿听别人谈是谁破坏了法越协定、是谁发动了印度支那战争的话。西方的外交官们为什么害怕谈历史呢？因为真正的历史事实，会揭开殖民主义者对亚洲人民侵略本质的。
    美国代表不愿意谈历史，是因为历史事实证明，美国一直怀抱着侵略朝鲜的野心。历史上记载着：朝鲜战争爆发前夕——一九五○年五月十七日，杜勒斯曾亲自跑到南朝鲜，视察了集中在三八线附近的李伪军阵地。这件事并有后来登在英美报纸上的一张照片为证。在这张照片上可以看到：在三八线的战壕里，杜勒斯簇拥在一大群美李匪军军官中间，用饿狼似的眼睛盯着面前的一张地图，旁边还有人高举望远镜向三八线以北窥视。仅仅这件历史事实，也正好说明了美国是发动朝鲜战争的侵略者。美国和李承晚的代表毫无理由地反对在全朝鲜举行自由选举，并且说什么南朝鲜早已举行过选举了。然而，历史上却这样记载着：在一九四八年五月十日南朝鲜举行的单独“选举”中虽然南朝鲜的警察和恐怖分子使用威逼手段强迫选民投票，但参加这次单独“选举”的仍然不到有选举权的选民总数的百分之三十。“选举”的结果在南朝鲜成立了“国民议会”，在一百九十八名议员中，有八十四人是地主、三十二人是资本家、二十三人是亲日官吏。通过这样的“国民议会”，美国终于把它豢养了三十多年的老走狗李承晚推上了“总统”的座位。这件历史事实，正好揭露了这次“选举”完全是违反民意的，说明了李承晚伪政权是美国一手扶植起来的。自然，谈到这些历史事实是对美国不利的。
    同样地，在印度支那问题上，历史事实对法国殖民者和美国干涉者也是不利的。历史事实证明，差不多一百年来法国一直是印度支那人民的暴虐的统治者。历史上记载着：在日本占领印度支那期间，法国殖民当局始终是日本占领军的热心合作者，当时的法国“马赛曲报”就曾说过：“当法国高级官员乖乖地充当贝当分子的时候，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下以罕有的勇气对日本法西斯作战。”历史上记载着：一九四六年三月六日，越南民主共和国政府和法国政府在河内签订了初步协定，协定上明文规定：法国承认越南民主共和国“是一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政”。历史上又记载着：那一年十二月十九日晚上，法国殖民者又完全撕毁了法越协定，对越南人民发动了大规模的侵略战争。历史上记载着：一九四九年六月十四日，在法国殖民当局的摆布下，保大“皇帝”在法国占领区西贡粉墨登场，当时，连英国资产阶级的“新政治家”杂志也承认：“保大仅仅是靠了法军刺刀的支持才得以存在的。”历史事实记载着：美国长期干涉印度支那战争。自然，这些历史事实都是皮杜尔和史密斯所不欢喜听的。
    西方的外交官们害怕谈历史，一方面是因为害怕担负发动侵略战争的责任，一方面是打算把朝鲜人民和印度支那人民反抗侵略的英勇斗争的史实一笔勾销。这样，就更便于他们蒙蔽舆论，企图在他们伪造的历史的借口下，抹煞朝鲜人民和印度支那人民的民族权利，使朝鲜问题和印度支那问题不得和平解决，把朝鲜和印度支那拖到扩大战争和殖民奴役的道路上去。
    掩耳盗铃是愚蠢的。历史事实并不会因为谁想歪曲或不愿去谈就不存在了。人们都认为：只有考虑到历史事实，才能切合实际地解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题；而有些人害怕谈历史，只能说明他们是居心阻挠日内瓦会议去解决这些重要的国际问题而已。
