Freedom from the East
-- Commemorating the Ninth Anniversary of the Liberation of Czechoslovakia
Ji Wo Duoleishi, Editor-in-Chief of "Red Rights," the Central Organ of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia

May 9th, the Czechoslovak Republic celebrates the ninth anniversary of its liberation from the iron heel of the Nazi occupiers. The liberation of the Czechoslovak people and the establishment of an independent people's democratic state are thanks to the heroic Soviet army. The Soviet army defeated the invading Nazi forces and raised the banner of victory over the Nazi German capital. There, the Nazi leader Hitler finally ended his shameful life.

The battles on the European theater of World War II ended in early May 1945. On May 8, Germany signed the instrument of unconditional surrender. However, the fighting within Czechoslovakia had not yet ceased. The Soviet army coming from the east engaged in fierce battles with the enemy, who were desperately struggling in their retreat. Field Marshal Schörner, who commanded the German Army "Center" Group in Czechoslovakia, attempted to rally the remnants of Nazi divisions and, relying on favorable natural conditions, turn Czechoslovakia into a bastion for his last-ditch resistance.

What were they – Field Marshal Schörner and those who followed him – hoping for when they planned to continue fighting like this?

At that time, American troops were stationed in western Czechoslovakia, eighty kilometers from the capital, Prague. They could have marched straight into Czechoslovakia without encountering any German resistance, as the Germans were preparing to surrender to American protection. However, the Americans pushed the entire burden of the fighting onto the Soviet army, which encountered fierce resistance from the Nazi legions in their offensive. At that time, many people did not know that the generals of the Hitlerite army and certain Nazi leaders had colluded with the U.S. military headquarters, which was interested in hindering the Soviet offensive as much as possible and inflicting greater losses on the Soviet army in its battles with the Nazi divisions. People did not yet know that Hitler's divisions had become tools wielded by American imperialists.

Further developments revealed the plans of the American imperialists. They established the West German state of Bonn, which is, in reality, the successor to German militarism. They revived the Nazi Wehrmacht to act as a thug for American imperialism. Even at the end of World War II, the American army had already prepared for all of this.

The large-scale bombing of Czechoslovak territory by the U.S. Air Force at the end of World War II was related to this plan. They did this to wreak havoc on the Czech regions before the Soviet army arrived.

Nazi generals were well aware of these plans. Messengers from the American army headquarters personally arrived at the headquarters of Schörner's army group on May 6 to discuss further joint actions with the Nazi generals. Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, had been enveloped in the flames of the armed uprising of the Czechoslovak people against the Nazi army since May 5. The Communist Party led this national liberation struggle formed by armed uprising actions. The U.S. military headquarters, which was negotiating with the Nazi generals, allowed the Nazi divisions to deal freely with the Czechoslovak people. The American headquarters' plan included an attempt to drown the Czechoslovak people's uprising in blood by using the SS.

In the plans of the American headquarters, Schörner's divisions had other uses. Schörner's twenty well-equipped divisions, plus the remnants that he could rally from the Eastern Front, which had collapsed under the deadly blows of the Soviet army, were a force valued by the American command in its further plans to "reorganize" Europe.

The powerful pressure of the heroic Soviet army, turning from Berlin towards the Krusne Hory Mountains on the Czechoslovak border on May 6, shattered Schörner's divisions and liberated Prague, the capital of the Czechoslovak Republic, on May 9, making all of the American headquarters' plans come to naught. The remnants of the defeated Nazi divisions retreated westward, seeking refuge under the protection of the Americans – and today, the officers of these divisions have become the backbone of the resurrected Wehrmacht in the Bonn state. However, not all of the defeated German army could escape. After defeating Schörner's army, the Soviet army captured 672,000 soldiers and 30 generals of the invading army in Czechoslovakia from May 9 to 13.

The immortal merit of liberating Czechoslovakia, saving the capital Prague, and preserving the lives of millions of people belongs to the heroic Soviet army. The merit of the Soviet army also lies in creating new possibilities for a free life for the Czechs and Slovaks after the Czechoslovak people were liberated from Hitler's occupation. Due to the merit of the Soviet army, the Czechoslovak people were able to decide their own destiny and establish a people's democratic republic, in which the working class and the working peasants united to ensure that the national democratic revolution further transitioned into a socialist revolution.

The People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia has achieved great success on this path. At the end of last year, industrial production – the decisive factor in the Czechoslovak national economy – had increased by 119 percent compared to the production level of capitalist Czechoslovakia in 1937. The land cultivated by the socialist sector in agriculture accounts for 44 percent of all cultivated land. Agricultural production has continued to grow for several years, and the unified agricultural cooperatives continue to consolidate in the countryside.

These achievements are significantly reflected in the improvement of the living standards of the Czechoslovak people. There are no longer any capitalists in the industrial sector of Czechoslovakia who get rich by exploiting the labor of workers, and at the same time, due to socialist construction, the lives of the working people are gradually improving, and their living standards are gradually rising. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, leading the working class in a solid alliance with the working peasant masses, is moving towards greater victories in socialist construction.

The Czechoslovak Republic is closely adjacent to West Germany under American occupation. Our border is well defended. Based on their own experiences, from the repeated attacks on Czechoslovak cities by the American army at the end of World War II and their temporary stay in the western territories of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people have recognized their true face. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people are extremely sympathetic to the heroic Korean people. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people firmly support the Soviet proposal for the establishment of a European collective security system. The Czechoslovak people hope that there will be a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany on the border of the Czechoslovak Republic, which can never again become a threat to its neighbors or an enemy of peace, where there are no more American occupation troops. The Czechoslovak people have drawn such lessons from the American army at a heavy price.

The Czechoslovak Republic is forever and resolutely united with our liberator – the great Soviet Union, with the people's democratic countries, with heroic Korea, and with the People's Republic of China with its 500 million people in the camp of peace and democracy. The People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia is fighting to defend peace, to continue building socialism, and to improve the living standards of the people.

The Czechoslovak people thank the Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet army that brought freedom to Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the slogan of the Czechoslovak people is: "Eternal friendship with the Soviet Union!"

    来自东方的自由
    ——纪念捷克斯洛伐克解放九周年
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央机关报“红色权利”报总编  辑沃·多雷什
    五月九日，捷克斯洛伐克共和国庆祝从纳粹占领者的铁蹄下争得解放的九周年。捷克斯洛伐克人民的获得解放和建立了独立的人民民主国家，要感谢英勇的苏联军队。苏军击溃了侵略的纳粹军队，在纳粹德国的首都升起了胜利的旗帜。在那里，纳粹元首希特勒终于结束了自己的可耻的一生。
    第二次世界大战中欧洲战场的战斗，是在一九四五年五月初结束的。五月八日，德国在无条件投降书上签了字。但是捷克斯洛伐克境内的战斗尚未停止。从东面来的苏军与在节节败退中作垂死挣扎的敌人进行了激烈的战斗。在捷克斯洛伐克境内指挥德国陆军“中央”军团的席尔内元帅，企图纠合纳粹师团的残兵败将，凭借有利的自然条件，把捷克斯洛伐克变成他负隅顽抗的堡垒。
    当他们——席尔内元帅和跟随他的一些人，打算这样继续作战的时候，他们所指望的是什么呢？
    那时，美军驻扎在捷克斯洛伐克西部距首都布拉格八十公里的地方。他们可以长驱直入捷克斯洛伐克而不会遭遇德军的任何抵抗，因为德军正准备投到美国人的保护之下。但是，美国人却把战斗的全部重担推给在进攻中遇到纳粹军团顽强抵抗的苏联军队。那时，很多人还不知道：希特勒军队的将领和某些纳粹头子已与美军总部有了勾结，美军总部所感到兴趣的，是尽可能阻止苏军的进攻，是使苏军在与纳粹师团的战斗中受到更大的损失；人们还不知道：希特勒的师团在那时已经成为美帝国主义者所掌握的工具。
    事件的进一步发展暴露了美帝国主义者的计划。他们建立了西德波恩国家，这个国家实际上是德国军国主义衣钵的继承者；他们使纳粹国防军复活起来，充当美帝国主义的打手。还在第二次世界大战末期，美军就已为这一切作了准备了。
    美国空军在第二次世界大战末期对捷克斯洛伐克领土进行的大规模轰炸，是与这个计划有关的。他们这样做是为了在苏军来到之前对捷克地区大肆破坏。
    纳粹将领对这些计划知道得很清楚。美军的信使于五月六日亲自来到席尔内军团的总司令部，与纳粹将领讨论进一步的联合行动。捷克斯洛伐克的首都布拉格从五月五日起已笼罩在捷克斯洛伐克人民反对纳粹军队的武装起义的火焰中。共产党领导了这个由武装起义行动所形成的民族解放斗争。正在与纳粹将领进行谈判的美军总部，允许纳粹师团自由地对付捷克斯洛伐克人民。在美国总部的计划中含有这样的企图，他们想假手纳粹党卫军把捷克斯洛伐克人民的起义淹没在血泊中。
    在美国总部的计划中，席尔内元帅的师团还有着另外一些用场。席尔内的二十个武器精良的师团，加上他所能纠合的在苏军的致命打击下从东线溃退下来的残兵败将，乃是美国统帅部在其进一步“整顿”欧洲的计划中所重视的力量。
    英勇的苏联军队的强大压力于五月六日由柏林转向捷克斯洛伐克边境的克鲁森山脉，击溃了席尔内元帅的师团，并于五月九日解放了捷克斯洛伐克共和国的首都布拉格，使美国总部的这些计划全都化为泡影。被击溃的纳粹师团的残余向西退却，在美国人的庇护下寻求生路——而在今天，这些师团的军官们成了波恩国家死灰复燃的国防军的骨干。然而，溃败的德军并不能全部逃脱。苏军在击溃席尔内的军队以后，从五月九日到十三日在捷克斯洛伐克境内俘获了侵略军的六十七万二千名士兵和三十名将领。
    解放捷克斯洛伐克、拯救首都布拉格和保全千百万人生命的不朽功绩，是属于英勇的苏联军队的。苏军的功绩还在于，在捷克斯洛伐克人民从希特勒的占领下获得解放以后，给捷克人和斯洛伐克人创造了自由生活的新的可能。由于苏联军队的功绩，捷克斯洛伐克人民能够自己决定自己的命运，并建立了人民民主的共和国，国内工人阶级与劳动农民联合起来，保证民族民主革命进一步转入社会主义革命。
    人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国在这条道路上获得了巨大的成就。去年年底，工业生产——这是捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的决定性因素——已较一九三七年资本主义捷克斯洛伐克时的生产水平增加了百分之一百一十九。农业中社会主义部分所耕种的土地占全部耕地的百分之四十四。几年来农业生产不断增长，统一农业合作社在农村中继续获得巩固。
    这些成就显著地表现在捷克斯洛伐克人民生活水平的提高上。捷克斯洛伐克的工业部门中已经没有靠剥削工人的劳动而发财致富的资本家，同时由于社会主义的建设，劳动人民的生活日渐改善，生活水平日渐提高。捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导着与劳动农民群众结成巩固联盟的工人阶级，在社会主义建设中走向更大的胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国与美军占领下的西德紧密毗连。我国的边境防卫得很好。捷克斯洛伐克人民根据自己的经验，从美军在第二次世界大战末期对捷克斯洛伐克城市的一再袭击和暂时留驻捷克斯洛伐克西部领土时的行为中，已认识了它们的真正面貌。因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民异常同情英勇的朝鲜人民。因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决支持苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。捷克斯洛伐克人民希望在捷克斯洛伐克共和国的边境有一个统一、民主与爱好和平的德国，它在任何时候也不能再成为它的邻国的威胁，不能再成为和平的敌人，在那里，不再有美国占领军。捷克斯洛伐克人民以昂贵的代价从美国军队那里得出了这样的经验。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国永远地和坚决地与我们的解放者——伟大的苏联、与各人民民主国家、与英雄的朝鲜和有五亿人口的中华人民共和国团结在和平民主阵营内。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国正在为保卫和平、为继续建设社会主义和提高人民的生活水平而斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民感谢苏联，感谢给捷克斯洛伐克带来自由的英勇的苏联军队。因此捷克斯洛伐克人民的口号是：“永远与苏联友好！”
