    Postal Van on the Construction Site
  　Fu Dong
    At 6:30 in the morning, the Beijing Post Office's vehicle drove into the construction site of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in Shilipu, East Suburb. As soon as the workers saw the words "Mobile Service Postal Van" on the vehicle, they crowded around and voluntarily formed a long line. At this time, a worker in a neat blue khaki uniform hurried over. As soon as he stood in line, he asked the people around him about the registration time at the South Pool Alley Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital. Although the line wasn't short, it was his turn in no time. He handed the money to the post office clerk, went to two more windows, and left the line happily, taking only five or six minutes in total. As he was about to leave, he was stopped by several people. One said, "Please help me write an envelope." Another said, "Please write a few simple words to my family for me." He looked at his watch and leaned over a temporary table set up in the factory and started writing.
    Speaking of remitting money, he had a tortuous story.
    His name is Li Zhenkun, and he is a bricklayer in the Engineering Company of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Central Textile Industry Department. He used to work for Shandong Construction Company in Qingdao. Last year, when the leaders mobilized him to participate in the construction of the capital, he came to Beijing without hesitation. As soon as Li Zhenkun arrived, he thought of going around and having a look. The first time he got paid, he made an appointment with a fellow villager who was a bricklayer in the West Suburb to have a good time in the city on Sunday. That morning, as soon as it was dawn, he got up, planning to remit money home first, then see a movie and visit a park. When he rushed to the Dongsi Pailou Post Office, he saw that the door of the post office was still tightly closed, but many people were already lining up on the side of the road waiting to remit money. After waiting and waiting, the post office opened at eight o'clock, and he happily thought, "It'll be quick now!" But things seemed to be deliberately difficult. The number of people in front didn't seem to decrease, and it wasn't until after ten o'clock that he entered the door. Once inside, he asked for an application form, filled it out hastily, and paid the money. He thought it was all over and was about to leave when he heard a comrade from the post office say, "Please go to the next window to get the money order." After receiving the money order, he impatiently squeezed to the window to buy stamps, but was reprimanded, "Why aren't you lining up?" Helplessly, he turned around and stood in line again. Who knew that a large group of people were already waiting at the stamp window. He bought the stamps after waiting for his number, and then lined up at the registration office to mail the letter. By the time he squeezed out of the crowd with the receipt for the registered letter, it was already past eleven o'clock. After leaving the post office, he rushed to the meeting place, and his fellow villager had been waiting anxiously. That day, he didn't get to see a movie, and didn't have much fun. He came back after only walking around a few places.
    It was good if he could go to the city to remit money on his day off, but sometimes he wasn't paid the day before Sunday, so he had to ask for leave to go to the city. Last April, the construction site was building a hyperbolic thin-shell brick vault warehouse, which was the most advanced type of warehouse designed by Soviet experts, built entirely of bricks with very few iron bars in the middle. Li Zhenkun's team was responsible for this most important bricklaying work. In order to welcome Red May, the team proposed the slogan of completing the task ahead of schedule. It was at this time that they were paid. Li Zhenkun held the stack of banknotes in his hand, and his mood was really conflicted. Asking for leave to go to the city to remit money would result in a deduction of wages, which was a small matter, but delaying production was a big matter. If he didn't remit the money, his family would go hungry. The last time, because the money was remitted a little late, his family had encountered difficulties in their lives. Li Zhenkun asked the team leader for leave, and a comrade named Yang in the team also asked for leave for the same reason, which made the team leader very embarrassed. There was no way but to temporarily transfer two workers from other teams. Li Zhenkun remitted the money and rushed back to the construction site all the way. When he asked about the impact on the work, it was not small. According to the usual progress, the vault could be completed in three and a half hours, but because of the two inexperienced workers, it took more than an hour, and the quality of the work was not good.
      "Before long, the post office simplified the procedures. In order to make it convenient for workers to remit money, they also sent special vehicles to the construction site on workers' rest days and set up 'mobile postal vans' at the construction site. These things no longer happen." Li Zhenkun said, "The new society considers workers in every way. Even the post office has changed its methods. Everyone's enthusiasm for work is great! If you add up the man-hours saved by workers not having to go to the city to remit money, it's really considerable!" Li Zhenkun paused here and said, "Now everyone can freely arrange their big breaks! Those who want to go to the city to have fun can have a good time, and those who want to rest in the factory can take a comfortable day off. Taking my going to the city for medical treatment today as an example, if it were like in the past, I would have spent a whole morning remitting money today and wouldn't have been able to register. Then I would have had to ask for leave the next day to go to the city, delaying half a day of production. But now, I have remitted the money and talked for so long, and when I get to the hospital, I will still have plenty of time!"

    工地上的邮车
  　傅冬
    早晨六点半，北京邮局的汽车就开进了东郊十里堡第一棉纺织厂的工地。工人一见车上挂的“流动服务邮车”几个字就都拥过来，主动地排成
  一条长长的队伍。这时，有一位穿着整齐的蓝咔叽制服的工人匆匆地赶来，他一站到队里，就向周围的人打听南池子耳鼻喉医院挂号的时间。队伍虽然排得不算短，但没一会功夫就轮到了他，他把钱交给邮局办事员，再走了两个窗口，就高高兴兴离开了队伍，前后也不过费了五六分钟的时间。他刚要走开，就被几个人拉住了，这个说：“请你帮我写个信封。”那个说：“请代我给家里写几句简单的话。”他看了看表，就伏在厂里临时设的一个桌子上写起来了。
    谈起寄钱的事来，他有一段曲折的故事。
    他叫李振崑，是中央纺织工业部基本建设局工程公司的一个瓦工。早先他在青岛山东建筑公司工作，去年领导上动员他参加首都建设，他没有一丝儿犹豫就到了北京。李振崑一来，就想到处去逛一逛。头一次发薪，他就和一位在西郊做瓦工的一位同乡约好，星期天时到城里痛痛快快玩一天。那天早上，天刚曚曚亮，他就起来，计划先给家里汇款，然后看电影，逛公园。当他匆匆赶到东四牌楼邮局，一看邮局的门还闭得紧紧的，但马路边却已有许多人排队在等汇款了。等着等着，邮局到八点钟开了门，他心里高兴地想：“这下就快了！”可是事情好像故意和人为难似的，前面的人老不见少，一直到十点多他才进了门。到了里面，要了申请单，匆匆填写好，把款缴上，他以为没事了，正想走，只听邮局的同志说：“请到隔壁窗口拿汇票。”领了汇票，他性急地挤到窗口去买邮票，却被人申斥了一顿：“为什么不排队？”没奈何又调过头来站队，那知道买邮票的窗口，已经有一大群人在等了，他挨着号买了邮票，又排队到挂号处寄信。等他拿着挂号信的收据从人群中挤出来时，已经十一点多了。从邮局出来，他三步两步赶到约会的地点，他的同乡早已等急了。那天，电影没有看成，玩的也不起劲，没遛几个地方就回来了。
    碰上休息天能进城汇钱还好，有时不是在星期日前一天发薪，那就得告假进城。去年四月工地正在建筑双曲线薄型砖拱顶仓库，这是苏联专家设计的一种最先进的仓库，全部用块砖砌成，中间只用很少的铁条。李振崑那个小组担任的就是这个最重要的砌砖工作，为了迎接红五月，小组提出提前超额完成任务的口号。就在这个时候发薪了，李振崑拿着那一叠钞票，心情真是矛盾得很，请假进城寄钱，扣工资是小事，耽误生产是大事；不寄钱吧，家里要挨饿，前一次就是因为钱寄的稍晚了一点，使家里人生活上发生困难。李振崑去组长面前请假，组里一位姓杨的同志也因同样的理由去请假，把组长搞的很为难。没办法，临时从别组调了两个工人。李振崑寄了钱，一路上紧赶慢赶，赶到工地一问，工作上受的影响可不小，本来按平日进度，拱顶三个半小时就可砌完，因为换了两个生手，结果多用了一个多小时，工作的质量还不好。
      “没多久，邮局就简化了手续，为了工人寄钱方便，在工人休息天还特别派了专车到工地，打‘流动邮车’来到工地，这些事儿，就再也没有了。”李振崑说：“新社会处处为工人打算，连邮局也变了新法儿，大伙干活的劲儿可大啦！如果把工人不进城汇款，节省的工时加起来可真是可观得很呢！”李振崑讲到这里，停了停又说：“现在大休息大伙都可自由支配了！愿意进城玩的可以痛痛快快地玩，想在厂里休息的可以舒舒服服歇一天。拿我今天进城看病打比方，如果像过去，我今天汇一早上钱，就赶不上挂号了，那又得第二天请假进城，耽误半天生产，可是现在，我寄了钱，又说了这么半天话，回头我赶到医院，时间还富富有余呢！”
