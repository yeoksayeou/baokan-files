    The first season of vegetable planting by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing has been completed. In order to fully supply the vegetable needs of the people of the capital, farmers in the suburbs have appropriately expanded the vegetable planting area. In Fengtai District, the Huangtugang Township and Baipenyao Township agricultural producers' cooperatives have increased vegetable acreage by more than 1,000 mu (replanted area). Farmers in Pai Fang and two other townships in Nanwan District have also converted 230 mu of paddy fields into vegetable gardens to increase vegetable production. During the spring plowing, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in addition to supplying a large number of waterwheels, new-style farm implements, and pesticides, also supplied suburban farmers with more than 23 million jin of various commercial fertilizers. The Municipal People's Bank and 179 credit cooperatives in the suburbs issued a total of 7.5 billion yuan in loans during the spring plowing season to support spring plowing production by farmers in the suburbs. In order to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing production, more than 260 cadres from the five districts of the city suburbs regularly resided in the townships to lead production, and responsible cadres from various departments also frequently went to the countryside to deepen the leadership of key production areas.

    北京郊区首季蔬菜播种结束
    北京市郊区农民第一季蔬菜播种工作已经结束。郊区农民为了充分供应首都人民蔬菜的需要，都适当地扩大了蔬菜播种面积。丰台区黄土岗乡、白盆窑乡两个农业生产合作社就增加了一千多亩（复种面积）蔬菜，南苑区牌房等三个乡的农民也把二百三十亩水地改成园田，以增加蔬菜生产。在春耕生产中，北京市供销合作总社除了供应了大批水车、新式农具、农药外，还供给郊区农民各种商品肥料二千三百多万斤。市人民银行和郊区一百七十九个信用合作社在春耕中共发放了七十五亿元贷款，支持郊区农民春耕生产、为了加强春耕生产的领导，市郊五个区经常有二百六十多名干部住在乡里领导生产，各部门负责干部也经常下乡深入重点领导生产。
