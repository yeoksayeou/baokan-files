    Asian Trade Union Friendship Symposium Issues Communiqué
    Suggesting Convening an Asian Trade Union Representatives Conference

   [Xinhua News Agency, May 9th] The Asian Trade Union Friendship Symposium, held in Beijing from May 5th to 8th, has successfully concluded.
    This symposium was held upon repeated proposals by influential trade union organizations and trade union leaders in Asia to strengthen mutual understanding and friendship. The trade union representatives from various Asian countries who came to Beijing unanimously agreed to hold the symposium based on the spirit of equality, friendship, mutual respect, and consultation.
    The following nine countries, with seventeen trade union organizations and fifty-five representatives, participated in this symposium:
  Burma　　 All Burma Trade Union Congress　　 Three representatives
  Ceylon　　 Ceylon Federation of Labour　　 Two representatives
            Ceylon Trade Union Federation　　 Two representatives
  China　　 All-China Federation of Trade Unions　　 Six representatives
  India　　 All India Bank Employees' Association　　 One representative
            All India Sugar Workers' Federation　　 One representative
            All India Trade Union Congress　　 One representative
            National Federation of Indian Railwaymen　　 One representative
            United Trades Union Congress of India　　 Two representatives
  Indonesia　　 Indonesian Trade Union Federation　　 Five representatives
            Indonesian Health Workers' Union　　 One representative
            Indonesian Pawnshop Workers' Union　　 One representative
            Central Organization of All Indonesian Workers　　 Eight representatives
  Korea　　 General Federation of Korean Trade Unions　　 Five representatives
  Mongolia　　 Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions　　 Three representatives
  Soviet Union　　 All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions　　 Eight representatives
  Vietnam　　 Vietnam General Confederation of Labour　　 Five representatives
    Eight trade union representatives from four countries who were invited to participate in the Beijing "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations attended the meeting as observers, including one from the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, three Israeli trade union leaders, two from the French General Confederation of Labor, and two from the Italian General Confederation of Labor.
    Other influential trade unions from other countries were willing to participate in the symposium, but were unable to attend due to difficulties in obtaining passports and other issues.
    At this Friendship Symposium, trade union representatives from various countries unanimously expressed the strong desire of the working class and people of Asian countries to strive for freedom and safeguard peace, independence, and democracy. They condemned the colonial policies pursued by imperialists in Asia. They believed that the times have changed rapidly, the era in which imperialists arbitrarily manipulated the Asian people is gone forever, and the sacred right of the Asian people to be their own masters must not be violated. In their speeches, the representatives strongly opposed the attempts by the US ruling clique to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, expand the war in Indochina, station troops in Asian countries, establish and maintain military bases, plot to establish aggressive military alliances and blocs, militarize Japan, and impose foreign military aid on Asian countries that endangers Asian peace, such as US military aid to Pakistan, and test hydrogen bombs in the Pacific.
    The representatives believed that these threatening activities have increased the suffering of the working class and other strata of people, damaged the national economies of Asian countries, and directly threatened the peace, independence, and security of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia. The representatives strongly opposed and condemned the criminal policy of "Asians fighting Asians."
    The representatives expressed deep concern about the further decline in the living standards of workers in many Asian countries, the increasingly miserable situation of farmers, the continuous closure of large numbers of national industrial and commercial enterprises, and the increasingly serious unemployment problem in recent years. Everyone believed that all these situations were caused by the colonial policies implemented by international monopoly capital in Asian countries, and the aggression and interference in Asian affairs by war instigators.
    The representatives warmly hoped that the Geneva Conference would make practical contributions to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina; and believed that it is necessary to be constantly vigilant against the attempts of war instigators to undermine the Geneva Conference and prevent it from reaching an agreement. They believed that people and public opinion should be mobilized to enable the conference to reach an agreement. They regretfully pointed out that Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon were unable to participate in the Geneva Conference due to the opposition and obstruction of the United States.
    The representatives unanimously hoped that the national independence and democratic freedom of the people of Asian countries should be guaranteed. They expressed the unanimous demand of the people of Asian countries for unity, vowed to defend peace in Asia and the world, develop their national economies, and carry out unrestricted international trade.
    The representatives unanimously believed that international unity and friendship of the working class should be strengthened and expanded so that workers of all countries can help and support each other; the unity of the working class of all countries with their own peasants and all peace-loving, democratic, and freedom-loving patriots should be strengthened and expanded to defend the national interests and democratic freedom of the people of all countries, and to realize the interests of workers and the urgent demands of peasants. The representatives expressed their willingness to do their best to fight for trade union rights, to improve the living standards and wage standards of working people, so that working people can maintain a life of sufficient food and clothing, protect the jobs of employees, implement and improve the social insurance system, improve working conditions, implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, implement full employment, and provide appropriate relief to the unemployed.
    In a warm and friendly atmosphere, the representatives fully and freely exchanged opinions, and unanimously and happily believed that such a symposium would help enhance mutual understanding and friendly unity between the working class and trade unions of Asian countries. The representatives hoped that there would be opportunities to hold such talks that would help mutual understanding in the future, and unanimously suggested to trade union organizations and trade union leaders in Asian countries that an Asian Trade Union Representatives Conference be held on the basis of friendship, unity, mutual respect, consultation, and regardless of political views and religious beliefs, in order to promote the realization of this wish.

    尚有其他国家有影响的工会愿意参加座谈会，但由于不能取得护照和其他困难，未能到会。
    在这次友谊座谈会上，各国工会代表一致表示了亚洲各国工人阶级和人民争取自由与维护和平、独立、民主的强烈愿望。他们谴责帝国主义者在亚洲推行的殖民政策。他们认为，时代已经迅速变化，帝国主义者任意摆布亚洲人民的时代已经一去不复返了，亚洲人民自己作主人的神圣权利绝不容许侵犯。代表们在发言中强烈地反对美国统治集团力图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，扩大印度支那战争，在亚洲国家驻扎军队，建立和保持军事基地，策划建立侵略性军事同盟和集团，使日本军国主义化，加于亚洲各国的、危害亚洲和平的、外来的军事援助，有如美国对巴基斯坦的军事援助，和在太平洋上试验氢弹。
    代表们认为，这些威胁性的活动，增加了工人阶级和其他阶层人民的痛苦，破坏了亚洲各国的国民经济，直接威胁着世界人民特别是亚洲人民的和平、独立与安全。代表们强烈反对并谴责“亚洲人打亚洲人”的罪恶政策。
    代表们深切地关怀着近年来亚洲许多国家工人生活更形下降，农民处境日益悲惨，大批民族工商业不断倒闭，失业问题日趋严重。大家认为：所有这些情况，是由于国际垄断资本对亚洲国家所实行的殖民政策，和战争挑拨者对亚洲事务进行的侵略和干涉所造成的。
    代表们热烈期望日内瓦会议作出实际贡献，以便和平解决朝鲜问题与恢复印度支那和平；并且认为应该时刻警惕战争挑拨者破坏日内瓦会议和力图阻止日内瓦会议达成协议的企图。他们认为应动员人民和社会舆论使该会议能达成协议。他们遗憾地指出：由于美国的反对与阻挠，亚洲国家如印度、印尼、缅甸、巴基斯坦及锡兰等国都未能参加日内瓦会议。
    代表们一致愿望亚洲各国人民的民族独立和民主自由应该得到保障。他们表示亚洲各国人民一致要求团结，誓将保卫亚洲与世界的和平，发展本国的国民经济，开展不受限制的国际贸易。
    代表们一致认为，应该加强与扩大工人阶级的国际团结与友好，以便一切国家的工人能够相互帮助与相互支援；加强与扩大各国工人阶级与本国农民以及一切爱好和平、民主、自由的爱国人士的团结，以保卫各国人民的民族利益和民主自由，实现工人的利益和农民的迫切要求。代表们表示愿意尽力争取工会权利，争取改善劳动人民的生活与工资标准，使劳动人民能够维持足够温饱的生活，保障职工的职业，实施与改进社会保险制度，改善劳动条件，实行男女同工同酬的原则，实行充分就业并对失业者给予适当救济。
    代表们在热烈友好的气氛中，充分自由地交换了意见，一致愉快地认为，这样的座谈会有助于增进亚洲各国工人阶级与工会之间的相互了解与友好团结。代表们希望今后能有机会再举行这样有助于相互了解的会谈，并一致向亚洲各国工会组织和工会领袖建议，在友好的、团结的、相互尊重的、协商的、不分政治见解和宗教信仰的基础上，召开一次亚洲工会代表会议，以促进这一愿望的实现。
