Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at All Levels Should Continue to Strengthen the Supply of Farm Tools
    Feng Yun

    This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have increased their business in various farm tools compared to previous years. According to statistics, the planned supply of new-style farm tools this year is 258,000 pieces, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year. The planned supply of old-style farm tools is over 120 million pieces, an increase of more than 70% compared to last year. However, the current supply of farm tools still cannot meet the needs of farmers. According to a survey of four agricultural production cooperatives in Songlindian, Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, each cooperative needs to add a waterwheel, a threshing machine, and a grain thresher this year, and each person also needs a small farm tool. According to estimates by the Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the province still lacks more than one million pieces of major farm tools such as plows and harrows this year. Therefore, continuing to strengthen the supply of various farm tools is still an important task for supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels.

    To strengthen the supply of farm tools, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should pay attention to the following tasks.

    First, adhering to the business policy of "local sourcing," fully tap local raw materials to solve the problem of farm tool production difficulties. We know that the steel, wood, and other raw materials needed to manufacture farm tools today, in the context of China's underdeveloped heavy industry and forestry, and with the state focusing its main efforts on building heavy industry, it is undoubtedly difficult and inappropriate to ask the state to fully supply steel and wood for manufacturing farm tools. Now, the state has allocated a portion of steel and wood raw materials to supply state-owned factories and local state-owned factories to manufacture new-style farm tools, but we cannot rely entirely on the state to solve the problem. We must mainly rely on supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to purchase scrap steel locally and solve the raw material problem for farm tool production locally. According to a typical survey of three households in Songlindian, Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, a total of 400 catties of scrap steel were stored. After discussion at the representative meeting, the Xiqu Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Chongzuo County, Guangxi Province, estimated that each township could collect more than 600,000 catties. The scrap steel purchased by the Gucheng Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Fourth District of Mingshui County, Heilongjiang Province, in January this year has exceeded the original plan by about 20%. This fully shows that there is a lot of scrap steel stored in the hands of farmers. However, not all supply and marketing cooperatives have paid attention to the work of purchasing scrap steel in rural areas. For example, the Chaoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Guangdong Province originally planned to entrust local handicraft workers to process 10,000 hoes, but because it did not actively purchase scrap steel raw materials, it has now stopped work due to lack of materials, resulting in a serious shortage of hoes and hoe handles in the local area, causing prices to rise. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province need 8,700 tons of old steel this year to manufacture old-style farm tools, but because they have not actively purchased it, they have only solved 300 tons, and the rest is still nowhere to be found. Of course, if individual areas have real difficulties in purchasing raw materials locally, the provincial cooperative federation can be responsible for mutual adjustment, or the local state-owned hardware company can provide appropriate supply or apply to the local government for a solution. However, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should not unilaterally rely on higher-level cooperatives to solve the problem, but should actively purchase from the vast rural areas to solve the raw material problem.

    To do a good job in supplying farm tools, supply and marketing cooperatives must also strengthen investigation and research, earnestly understand the needs of local farmers, and then organize handicraft processing and manufacturing of various farm tools. We know that due to the production habits of the vast number of farmers and the different soil and climate conditions in various places, the specifications, quality, and timing of farm tools needed by farmers in various places are not entirely the same. In some places, the specifications of farm tools needed are different not only within a county, but also within a district or a township. For example, farmers in the Fourth District of Ya'an County, Xikang Province, are accustomed to using forked plowshares, while farmers in the Third District are accustomed to using hat plowshares. This shows that it is very important for supply and marketing cooperatives to do a good job in investigation and research. If they do not proceed from the needs of farmers and engage in blind business, they will not only fail to meet the needs of farmers, but also cause inventory backlog and affect operations. According to local experience, the methods of investigation can be: (1) conducting investigations through local agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and village administrative groups; (2) conducting investigations through typical villages in different areas such as water, dry, sandy, mountainous, or rice, wheat, cotton, and tobacco fields; (3) conducting investigations through typical households of poor, middle, and rich farmers; (4) conducting investigations through old farmers' symposiums, member representative meetings, and administrative group leader meetings; (5) In addition, when the cooperative sells goods, the salesperson should establish a fixed trading relationship with the customer based on the supply of goods and customer requirements, and record the name, quality, quantity, and purchase time of the goods as a plan for operating farm tools. Taking these measures can avoid blindness in operation, thereby solving the problem of inventory backlog and shortages of farm tools, and promoting planned production by handicrafts. To do this, it is necessary to educate the cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives to truly go deep into the farmers and earnestly understand their needs.

    In the supply of new-style farm tools, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and spare parts repair work, and to "spread new-style farm tools to where, and teach technology to where." In the past, many supply and marketing cooperatives did not pay much attention to this. They believed that "we are sales departments, we don't care about teaching technology," and once they sold it, "everything is fine." Obviously, this is an old merchant's style of operation, which is not allowed in our supply and marketing cooperative's operation. Because the supply and marketing cooperative is a socialist commercial enterprise, it is different from general buying and selling. The purpose of supplying farmers with means of production is to improve agricultural production and promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. If the supply and marketing cooperative only cares about sales and does not teach farmers the technology to use it, it will become detached from the masses. For example, the Tangshan Special District in Hebei Province has supplied more than 5,000 various walking plows in recent years. Because some farmers do not know how to use them or because spare parts are not supplied, many new-style walking plows have become "hanging plows." Among the large number of waterwheels sold by supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province, farmers requested repairs for more than 4,000 units, but the cooperatives did not find a way to repair them for the farmers, causing dissatisfaction among the farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should learn from these lessons, truly establish the spirit of serving agricultural production, and do a good job in teaching technology to farmers through supply, so as to "guarantee teaching and guarantee mastery," and ensure the quality of farm tools. To do this, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must closely integrate with local agricultural technology extension stations. At the same time, they can also hold new farm tool exhibitions at temple fairs and towns to teach technology to farmers. In addition, they can also organize handicraft workers to go to the countryside regularly, carrying spare parts to repair farm tools for farmers. To do this, cadres in charge of operating means of production must first learn the technology. Only in this way can we better complete the task of selling farm tools and prepare for the large-scale supply of new-style farm tools and large farm tools to farmers in the future.

    各级供销合作社应继续加强农具供应工作
    冯云
    今年各地供销合作社经营的各种农具较往年增加。据统计：今年计划供应的新式农具有二十五万八千件，较去年增加了百分之二十五以上，计划供应的旧式农具有一亿两千多万件，较去年增加百分之七十以上。但目前的农具供应仍不能满足农民的需要。据河北省涿县松林店四个农业生产合作社的调查，每社今年都要增加水车、打谷机、脱谷机各一件，小农具也每人需要一把。又据安徽省供销合作社的估计，全省今年尚缺犁、耙主要农具达百万多件。所以，继续加强各种农具的供应工作，仍是各级供销合作社当前一项重要的任务。
    为了加强农具供应工作，各级供销合作社应注意如下几项工作。
    首先，本着“就地取材”的经营方针，充分挖掘地方原料，解决农具生产困难问题。我们知道，今天制造农具所需要的钢铁、木材等原料，在我国重工业和林木业还不发达、在国家首先集中主要力量建设重工业的情况下，要求国家充分供应钢铁、木材进行制造农具，无疑地是有困难的，也是不应当的。现在，国家已调拨了一部分钢铁和木材原料，供应国营工厂和地方国营工厂来制造新式农具，但我们不能完全依靠国家来解决，主要仍须依靠各级供销合作社就地收购废钢铁，就地解决农具生产工具的原料问题。根据河北省涿县松林店三户典型调查，共存有废钢铁达四百斤。广西省崇左县西区供销合作社经代表会议讨论后，估计每乡能收购六十多万斤；黑龙江省明水县四区古城村供销合作社今年一月份收购的废钢铁，已超过原订计划百分之二十左右。这充分说明，农民手中存放的废钢铁是很多的。但是，农村废钢铁的收购工作并不是所有的供销合作社都已重视起来了。譬如广东省潮阳县供销合作社原计划委托当地手工业者加工锄头一万把，但因其不积极收购废钢铁原料，现已停工待料，以致当地锄头与锄头柄都发生严重的脱销现象，引起价格上涨。江苏省各地供销合作社今年制造旧式农具需要旧钢铁八千七百吨，因不积极收购，现在只解决了三百吨，其余的至今还无着落。当然，如果个别地区就地收购原料确有困难，可以由省合作总社负责进行互相调剂，或由当地国营五金公司进行适当供应或申请当地政府给以解决。但各级供销合作社不要片面地依靠上级社解决，而应积极地向广大农村进行收购，以解决原料困难问题。
    要作好农具供应工作，供销合作社还必须加强调查研究工作，切实了解当地农民的要求，然后再组织手工业加工和制造各种农具。我们知道，由于广大农民的生产习惯和各地土质气候不同，因此各地农民所需要的农具规格、质量、以及时间都不尽相同。在有些地方，不仅在一个县内所需要的农具规格不同，就是在一个区内或一个乡内也有所不同，如西康省雅安县四区农民习惯用岔铧，而三区农民却习惯用帽子铧。由此可见，供销合作社作好调查研究工作是十分重要的。如果不从农民的需要出发，盲目经营，不但不能满足农民的需要，并且会造成积压，影响经营。调查的方法，根据各地经验，可采取：（一）通过当地农业生产合作社、互助组和村行政小组进行调查；（二）通过水、旱、沙、山地或稻、麦、棉、烟田等不同地区的典型村进行调查；（三）通过几户贫、中、富农的典型户调查；（四）通过老农座谈会、社员代表会、行政小组长会进行调查；（五）另外，合作社在卖货时，由营业员根据货源情况与顾主要求固定买卖关系，把商品的名称、质量、数量、进货时间记录下来，作为经营农具计划。采取这些办法，就能避免经营中的盲目性，从而解决农具的积压和脱销问题，并且促使手工业有计划地生产。而要做好这项工作，必须教育供销合作社干部真正深入到农民中去，切实了解农民的要求。
    在供应新式农具中，必须加强技术指导和零件的修配工作，要作到“新式农具推广到那里，技术传授到那里”。过去很多供销合作社对此是很不重视的，他们认为“咱们是推销部门，不管传授技术”，推销出去就“万事大吉”。很显然，这是一种旧商人的经营作风，在我们供销合作社的经营中是不允许存在的。因为供销合作社是社会主义性质的商业，它不同于一般的买卖，它供应农民生产资料的目的就是为了提高农业生产，促进对农业的社会主义改造。如果供销合作社只管推销，不教给农民使用的技术，那就会脱离群众。如河北省唐山专区几年来已供应各种步犁五千余件，由于有些农民不会使用或因零件供应不上，很多新式步犁成了
  “挂犁”。山东省各级供销合作社在售出的大批水车中，农民要求修理的就达四千余部，但合作社没有设法替农民修理，致引起农民的不满。各级供销合作社应该接受这些教训，确实树立为农业生产服务的精神，通过供应向农民作好传授技术的工作，作到
  “保教、保会”，并且保证农具的质量。要做好这一工作，各级供销合作社就必须和各地农业技术推广站密切结合，同时，还可通过庙会和镇市，举行新农具展览会，向农民传授技术，此外，还可组织手工业工人定期下乡，携带零件为农民修理农具。为了做到这一点，负责经营生产资料的干部必须首先学习技术。只有这样，才能更好地完成推销农具的任务。并为今后大量供应农民新式农具、大型农具准备好条件。
