Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. According to Vietnam News Agency on the 2nd: On the afternoon of April 10th, at 2 PM, French invading forces used American aircraft to indiscriminately bomb Longya, killing 450 residents and wounding 200.

　　Longya is a small village between Mang Qing, the center of the Dien Bien Phu group of strongholds, and Hang Gang, a southern stronghold. The enemy concentrated more than 2,000 residents from twenty-five small villages in this small area. They are often subjected to various persecutions by the enemy.

　　After the enemy's connection between Mang Qing and Hang Gang was cut off by the People's Army, the residents of Longya were also liberated. But before they had time to move to a safe area, a small team of American-made bombers bombed and strafed this small village for nearly an hour. At that time, 300 houses were burned to ashes, and 200 tons of grain were completely destroyed. Most of the victims were the elderly, women, and children, and the able-bodied men of most of the affected families had been captured by the enemy and used as puppet troops in Hang Gang.

　　After the air raid, the People's Army stationed near Longya helped the residents properly bury their relatives and gave them appropriate care.

    法军使用美机进行滥炸
    龙涯村居民死伤六百多人
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社二日讯：四月十日下午二时，法国侵略军使用的美国飞机滥炸龙涯，炸死居民四百五十人，炸伤二百人。
    龙涯是奠边府集团据点中心芒清和南部据点航岗之间的一个小村庄。敌人把二十五个小村庄的两千多居民集中在这一小块地方。他们经常遭受敌人的多方迫害。
    敌军在芒清和航岗间的联系被人民军切断以后，龙涯的居民也获得了解放。但在他们还没有来得及迁到安全地区的时候，一小队美制轰炸机就向这小村庄轰炸和扫射将近一小时之久。当时有三百幢房屋被烧成灰烬，二百吨谷子完全被毁。受害者大多数是老人、妇女和小孩，受难的大多数家庭的青壮年都已被敌人抓到航岗充当伪军。
    在空袭以后，驻在龙涯附近的人民军帮助居民们妥葬了他们的亲属，并给了他们以适当的照顾。
