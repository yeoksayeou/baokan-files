Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 15th: The cotton planting area in East China has exceeded the national plan. According to reports recently received by the East China Administrative Council's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy from the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces, over 25 million mu of cotton fields have been sown or are being sown in the entire region, exceeding the plan by more than 400,000 mu. In areas where cotton sowing has not yet been completely finished in provinces such as Jiangsu, farmers are continuing to sow. In areas where sowing has already been completed, farmers are beginning to check the seedlings and replant to ensure full and strong growth.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 15th: In Turpan County, a well-known cotton-producing area in Xinjiang Province, more than 33,000 mu of cotton fields have been sown in a timely manner. The cotton sowing period this year was 10 to 15 days earlier than in previous years. Many cotton fields have already sprouted, and most are growing sturdily and uniformly. This year, the cotton field area in Turpan County has expanded by 16% compared to last year, and the planned yield per unit area is 15.6% higher than last year.

Before the spring plowing, the People's Government held training classes for mutual aid team leaders at the county and district levels and convened meetings of cotton farmer representatives to teach advanced cotton planting techniques. The People's Government also supplied farmers of all ethnic groups with 728 pieces of various new-style agricultural tools for cotton field cultivation, 175,000 jin of "S-3173" high-quality cotton seeds, 1,241 kilograms of Ceresan powder for seed treatment, and issued 500 million yuan in cotton field fertilizer and water conservancy loans. In order to guide cotton farmers in production, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, in addition to converting the Turpan Horticultural Farm into a cotton crop experiment station, hired Professor Titov of the Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, a Soviet cotton planting expert, to provide technical guidance. Fourteen cotton industry technical cadres were also sent to specifically help farmers improve their techniques.

With the help of the People's Government, farmers of all ethnic groups in Turpan County have gradually changed their extensive farming methods. This year, 57% of the cotton fields in Turpan County were winter-irrigated; the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by three to five cartloads compared to last year, and farmers mostly carried out cotton seed selection, chemical seed treatment, and seed soaking. The vast majority of cotton fields in the county were sown using cotton planters. The area planted in rows increased from 6% last year to about 85%.

In order to ensure irrigation water for the cotton fields, farmers of all ethnic groups began to dredge karez wells from January this year, dredging 309 karez wells in the past five months. This year, Turpan County will also trial furrow irrigation and frequent irrigation on more than 1,000 mu of cotton fields in the cotton crop experiment station, agricultural production cooperatives, and some mutual aid groups in order to gradually improve cotton field irrigation methods.

    华东区植棉面积超过国家计划
    新疆吐鲁番县三万多亩棉田播种完毕
    【新华社上海十五日电】华东区棉花播种面积已超过国家规定的计划。据华东行政委员会农林水利局最近收到各省农林厅的报告，全区已经播种和正在播种的棉田有二千五百多万亩，超过计划四十多万亩。现在江苏等省棉花播种尚未完全结束的地区，农民们还在继续播种。在播种已经结束的地区，农民们正开始查苗补苗，争取苗全苗旺。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐十五日电：新疆省著名棉花产地吐鲁番县三万三千多亩棉田已适时播种完毕。今年棉田播种期比往年提前了十天到半月，现在许多棉田已经出苗，大多茁壮整齐。今年吐鲁番县棉田面积比去年扩大了百分之十六，计划单位面积产量比去年提高百分之十五点六。
    春耕前，人民政府举办县、区互助组长训练班，并召集棉农代表会议，讲授了先进的植棉经验。人民政府还为各族农民供应了用于棉田耕作的各种新式农具七百二十八件，“斯三一七三”优良棉籽十七万五千斤，拌种的赛力散药粉一千二百四十一公斤，并发放棉田肥料和水利贷款五亿元。为了指导棉农生产，新疆省人民政府除将吐鲁番园艺场改为棉作试验场外，聘请新疆八一农学院教授、苏联植棉专家提托夫进行技术指导。并派出十四名棉业技术干部具体帮助农民改进技术。
    吐鲁番县各族农民在人民政府的帮助下，已逐渐改变了粗放的耕作方法。今年吐鲁番县棉田百分之五十七进行了冬灌；施肥量每亩较去年增加了三至五车，农民们大都进行了棉籽粒选，药剂拌种和浸种。全县绝大多数棉田使用了播棉机播种。行种的面积由去年的百分之六增加到百分之八十五左右。
    各族农民为了保证棉田的灌溉用水，从今年一月就开始掏捞坎儿井，五个月来掏捞的坎儿井达三百零九道。今年吐鲁番县还将在棉作试验场、农业生产合作社和部分互助组的一千多亩棉田上试行沟灌、勤灌，以便逐步改进棉田灌溉方法。
