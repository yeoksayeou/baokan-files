Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway's Key Project This Year
    Wushaoling Tunnel Completed

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 25th: The Wushaoling Tunnel of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was successfully completed at 12:00 PM on May 22nd, fifteen days ahead of schedule. This large tunnel is a key project for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway this year, and its early completion provides favorable conditions for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to complete its track-laying task this year.

    The Wushaoling Tunnel is located at the highest peak of Wushaoling. It is two li in length and the project was quite arduous. To complete this tunnel, it was necessary to excavate more than 60,000 cubic meters of earth and rock, including thirty-two different types of soil and stone, and to pour more than 20,000 cubic meters of concrete of varying strengths. The work started on July 1st last year, and most of the construction period was in the windy, snowy, and cold season, with the lowest temperature on the construction site dropping to minus 33 degrees Celsius. However, with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the tunnel workers brought into play their labor enthusiasm and creativity, promoted mechanized construction methods, and finally overcame the difficulties caused by these changeable weather conditions and complex soil conditions.

    兰新铁路今年关键工程
    乌鞘岭大隧道竣工
    【新华社西安二十五日电】兰新铁路乌鞘岭大隧道已在五月二十二日夜十二时比原计划提前十五天胜利竣工。这条大隧道是今年兰新铁路的关键工程，它的提前竣工给兰新铁路完成今年铺轨任务创造了便利条件。
    乌鞘岭大隧道位于乌鞘岭的最高峰。全长两华里，工程相当艰巨。打通这个隧道，要在洞内挖出六万多立方公尺的包括三十二种不同性质的土、石方，浇灌两万多立方公尺的不同强度的混凝土。在去年七月一日开工后的十个多月中，绝大部分的工期又都是在风雪严寒的季节，工地上的最低温度曾降到摄氏零下三十三度。但是隧道工人们在苏联专家的无私帮助下，发挥了劳动积极性和创造性，推行了机械化施工方法，终于克服了这些气候多变、土质复杂等等自然条件所造成的困难。
