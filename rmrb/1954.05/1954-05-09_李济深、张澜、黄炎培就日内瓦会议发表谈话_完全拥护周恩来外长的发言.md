Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a statement on the Geneva Conference on the 8th, saying: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference represents the firm will of over 500 million Chinese people and reflects the sincere wishes of peace-loving people in Asia. On behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, I express my heartfelt endorsement and full support.

Li Jishen said: The speeches of Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il, and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out the correct path to consolidate peace in Asia and ease international tensions. The proposal made by Foreign Minister Nam Il regarding the reunification of Korea and the holding of free elections throughout Korea, as Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said, is entirely fair and reasonable and should serve as the basis for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Regarding the Indochina issue, colonial rule should be ended, foreign interference should cease, and the national independence and freedom of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos should be guaranteed to restore peace in Indochina. As for the more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war forcibly detained by the US-ROK authorities, they must be allowed to return to their homeland; the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in international affairs must be restored; and the Chinese territory of Taiwan must not be occupied by the United States. If the Geneva Conference adheres to the principle that Asian people have the full right to handle their own affairs, Asian problems can be completely resolved.

Li Jishen said: The Chinese people sincerely hope that the Geneva Conference will produce results conducive to peace, but at the same time, they are vigilantly watching the various obstructive and disruptive activities of the United States. We resolutely oppose the United States' instigation to organize aggressive blocs, expand aggressive wars, and endanger peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued a statement on the Geneva Conference on the 8th, fully endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's righteous and stern speech at the Geneva Conference.

Zhang Lan said: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, leading our country's delegation to the Geneva Conference, has made great efforts over the past two weeks to peacefully resolve Asian issues, ease international tensions, and consolidate world peace. We fully endorse this peaceful foreign policy announced by Foreign Minister Zhou on behalf of our country; we fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's support for Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal regarding a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; we fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's three proposals regarding the issue of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war; and at the same time, we fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's efforts to establish peace in Indochina in accordance with the principles of people's freedom and national independence. The propositions put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou at the Geneva Conference are in line with the demands of the entire Chinese people and the interests of the people of the world.

Zhang Lan said: US imperialism is still continuing its conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference, still continuing its policy of hostility and provocation towards the People's Republic of China, completely rejecting the suggestions of the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, refusing to withdraw its troops from South Korea, and still vainly attempting to piece together an aggressive bloc in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, attempting to further interfere in the Indochina war, establish new colonial rule in Asia, and prepare for a new world war. These aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism are doomed to failure under the opposition of the people of the world. But we must not relax our vigilance in the slightest.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference. Huang Yanpei said that the People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. It has made many efforts in the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world in recent years. This time, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, attended the Geneva Conference, in line with our country's consistent peaceful foreign policy, bearing the solemn mission entrusted to us by the Chinese people to consolidate peace in Asia and the world. World opinion unanimously cheered the participation of the People's Republic of China in the conference because people have clearly seen that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no important Asian issue can be resolved.

Huang Yanpei said that in the more than ten days since the opening of the Geneva Conference, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, in two speeches, represented the will of the Chinese people and supported the suggestions of Foreign Minister Nam Il, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, regarding a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Foreign Minister Zhou also suggested that Asian countries should consult with each other and make joint efforts to maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually undertaking corresponding obligations. His righteous and magnificent voice moved all justice-minded Asians and aroused widespread attention among the people of the world, especially the people of Asia.

Huang Yanpei said: We Chinese people and Asian people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe and other parts of the world. Our people fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou's proposition in his speech on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, as well as the proposition to stop arming West Germany through consultations among the major powers and to guarantee European security on the basis of the collective efforts of all European countries. We believe that it is necessary to stop the expansion of armaments, implement universal disarmament, and prohibit the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    李济深、张澜、黄炎培就日内瓦会议发表谈话
    完全拥护周恩来外长的发言
    【新华社八日讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深八日就日内瓦会议发表谈话说：我国外交部部长周恩来在日内瓦会议上的发言，代表了全中国五万万以上人民的坚强意志，也反映着全亚洲爱好和平人民的真诚愿望，我代表中国国民党革命委员会，表示衷心的拥护和全力的支持。
    李济深说：莫洛托夫外长、南日外务相和周恩来外长在会议上的发言，指明了巩固亚洲和平、缓和国际紧张局势的正确道路；南日外务相所提出的关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案，诚如周恩来外长所说，是完全公平合理的，应该成为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础。关于印度支那问题，应该结束殖民统治和停止外来干涉，保障越南、高棉、寮国三国人民的民族独立和自由，以恢复印度支那的和平。至于美韩当局强迫扣留的四万八千余名朝中被俘人员必须得以重返祖国；中华人民共和国在国际事务中的合法权利必须恢复；中国的领土台湾不容美国侵占。如果日内瓦会议本着亚洲人民完全有权利来自己处理自己的事情的原则，亚洲问题是完全可以得到解决的。
    李济深说：中国人民以极大的诚意希望日内瓦会议产生有利于和平的结果；但同时警惕地注意着美国的种种阻挠破坏活动。我们坚决反对美国策动组织侵略集团，扩大侵略战争，危害亚洲及世界的和平。
    【新华社八日讯】中国民主同盟主席张澜八日就日内瓦会议发表谈话，完全拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上义正词严的发言。
    张澜说：周恩来外交部部长率领我国代表团出席日内瓦会议，两周来对于和平解决亚洲问题、缓和国际紧张局势、巩固世界和平作了极大的努力。我们完全拥护周外长代表我们国家所宣布的这种和平外交政策；我们完全拥护周外长支持南日外务相所提的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议；完全拥护周外长对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮强迫扣留朝中战俘问题所作的三项建议；同时完全支持周外长对于在印度支那建立符合于人民自由和民族独立原则的和平的一切努力。周外长在日内瓦会议上所提出的主张，是符合全中国人民的要求的，也是符合全世界人民的利益的。
    张澜说：美帝国主义则仍在继续其破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋活动，仍继续对中华人民共和国的敌视和挑衅政策，完全拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的建议，拒绝从南朝鲜撤出它的军队，并仍妄想拼凑西太平洋和东南亚的侵略集团，企图对印度支那战争进行进一步的干涉，在亚洲建立新的殖民统治并准备新的世界战争。美帝国主义的这些侵略阴谋，在全世界人民的反对下，是注定了会失败的。但我们决不能丝毫放松警惕。
    【新华社八日讯】中国民主建国会总会常务委员会主任委员黄炎培发表谈话，拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。黄炎培说，中华人民共和国一贯地奉行着和平外交政策。它几年来在维护和巩固亚洲及世界和平的事业上，作了很多努力。这次以周恩来外长为首的中华人民共和国代表团，本着我国一贯奉行着的和平外交政策，担负着我国人民所付托的巩固亚洲及世界和平的庄严使命，出席了日内瓦会议。世界舆论一致为中华人民共和国参加会议而欢呼，因为人们一致看清楚，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，任何重要的亚洲问题，都是不可能得到解决的。
    黄炎培说，在日内瓦会议开幕以来的十多天中，我国周恩来外长在两次发言中代表着中国人民的意志，支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表南日外务相关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。周外长并建议亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。他的正气磅礴的声音，感动了所有有正义感的亚洲人，在世界人民，特别是在亚洲人民中间引起了广泛的重视。
    黄炎培说：我们中国人民和亚洲人民不仅关心亚洲的和平，而且也关心欧洲和世界其他地区的和平。我国人民完全拥护周外长在发言中关于和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，以及建议经由大国协商的道路，停止武装西德，并在所有欧洲国家集体努力的基础上保证欧洲的安全的主张。我们认为，必须停止扩张军备，实行普遍裁军，禁止使用原子武器、氢武器、细菌武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器。
