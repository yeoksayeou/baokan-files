Heroes Conquer "Zhua Zhua Rock"

　　"Zhua Zhua Rock" is a necessary passage for Yi people going to and from Leibo County and Shangtianba in southern Sichuan Province.

　　Twenty years ago, there was a small path here for passage, but in order to avoid the plunder of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the Yi people blew up the path. Since then, people had to grab the stone holes on the rock and climb step by step to pass through here. If they were not careful, they would fall into the thirty-foot-deep rock and be buried in the rolling Jinsha River. Therefore, the Yi people called this place "Zhua Zhua Rock." There are also two sentences circulating here: "Tears flow into a river on 'Zhua Zhua Rock,' and the bones under the rock are more numerous than the stones." It can be seen how many Yi compatriots have lost their lives here.

　　On August 2, 1953, the engineering platoon of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army came here. They were to build a road on "Zhua Zhua Rock." The task was very arduous. Not only was it a cliff, but it was also all hard rock. A heavy hammer would only leave a white mark. It was necessary to drill holes, blast away the stubborn rocks, and then build a road. But there was no foothold on the rock, so the soldiers were suspended in mid-air with ropes to operate. In some places, they couldn't even straighten their backs and could only kneel to work. Many people had blisters on their hands and their knees were scraped, but they didn't complain or rest, and continued to work hard. The soldiers said, "If we delay for a day, the Yi compatriots will suffer for another day!" Dong Zhonglai, the squad leader of the second squad, injured one hand with a heavy hammer. The deputy platoon leader asked him to rest, but he said, "Although I can't swing a sledgehammer with one hand, I can still hold a drill." In order to improve work efficiency, the soldiers looked for tricks and thought of ways. After Comrade Yang Zhishu came up with a way to change the line, he saved more than fifty workdays. They also implemented a system of eating in shifts, which allowed them to work three more hours each day. The Yi people were moved by the heroic behavior of the People's Liberation Army and sent firewood, water, wood, and vegetables to support them. By August 21, a road one to two meters wide had appeared on "Zhua Zhua Rock." In order to ensure that the Yi compatriots could pass through here with absolute safety, the soldiers also erected a solid wooden railing on the side of the road. Since then, the Yi compatriots have been able to pass through here freely. Salt, cloth, and daily necessities were also continuously transported to the areas where the Yi people lived, which improved the lives of the Yi people. Whenever they met the People's Liberation Army on this road, they would give a thumbs-up and praise, "Dajun wawawa (The People's Liberation Army is the best)!" (Li Dazhong)

Opened the "Culture Gate" for Fishermen

　　A letter was sent to a certain island. It was from the second younger brother of fisherman Li Wenchuan, written from Korea. Li Wenchuan held the letter and stammered as he read it to his father. His father listened and couldn't help stroking his beard and smiling. This old man never dreamed that his son would be able to recognize so many characters in just over twenty days. He took out an old account book from the box and hurried to Comrade Wang Zhonghuai, the teacher, to ask Wang Zhonghuai to copy the new characters into the account book so he could study them. He said, "I also want to learn culture. Even if I learn one character a day, I can learn more than three hundred characters a year. Over time, I will definitely be able to read the second brother's letter and write to him myself, asking him to perform meritorious service for the people!"

　　Wang Zhonghuai is a naval soldier stationed on the island. Like other soldiers, he only learned to read and write during the cultural great march. He said, "If I have culture, I must make the fishermen not be 'blind' in order to better build the motherland!" Therefore, he and all the soldiers in the squad suggested to the superiors to establish a school here to teach the nearby fishermen to read. The superiors and the local people's government agreed with their opinion and also gave them some chalk and books, with Wang Zhonghuai serving as the teacher.

　　The young people and children of the nearby fishermen all came to school. Without a classroom, the soldiers used their own rooms as classrooms. It was difficult to buy paper on the island, so Wang Zhonghuai mobilized the students to dig stone slabs in the mountains and practice writing on the stone slabs. In teaching, Wang Zhonghuai was very patient, and he would carefully explain the places the students didn't understand. Sometimes he was sick, but he still insisted on teaching. The students were also very enthusiastic about learning. A student named Chunsheng, an eleven-year-old child, lived relatively far from the learning place, but he came very early every day, and never missed a class even when it was windy or rainy. Li Wenchuan was a relatively good student. He carried a single-character book with him when he worked in the field and took it out to read during breaks. Sometimes, he carried firewood on his shoulders and kept chanting, "勹丫八——八路军的八 (bao ya ba - the ba of the Eighth Route Army)". He said, "If I don't learn culture well, I'll be sorry not only to Chairman Mao, but also to the teacher!" In this way, after more than twenty days of learning time, he had already been able to roughly read his second brother's letter. (Gu Min)

As Long as the Child is Alive

　　In the early morning, the sea was very calm, but it seemed deeper and wider than when it was stormy.

　　It was just eight o'clock in the morning, and Comrade Zheng Dongliang was busy checking the shooting equipment. He lowered his head and carefully swept the mud off the target.

　　The coast was also quiet, with only five or six children jumping and playing on the pier. They picked up stones and threw them hard into the sea. The splashes of water caused the children to laugh gleefully. Zheng Dongliang couldn't help but be moved by the joyful laughter. He often looked up at the children, and a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. He said to himself, "How happy and lovely the children are!"

　　Suddenly, the children's desperate screams came over. He quickly put down the target and ran to the pier, only to find out that a little girl had fallen into the sea. Without even taking off his clothes, he jumped into the sea towards the place where the child had fallen.

　　Zheng Dongliang was swimming and groping underwater. One minute, two minutes, he kept sticking his head out of the water, looking for the child's whereabouts. Suddenly, the sea bubbled slightly over there, and two small braids appeared. He swam over like an arrow and reached out to hold up the girl.

　　The child's mother received the news and ran over like a madwoman. Her face was as yellow as wax with fright, and she couldn't speak. She took the child from Zheng Dongliang's arms, looked at the child's frozen purple lips, and looked at the naval comrade in front of her whose military uniform was dripping with water. Her eyes turned red, and hot tears fell drop by drop on the child's face.

　　"Warm the child up quickly. Don't cry, the child is not in danger!" Zheng Dongliang comforted the girl's mother.

　　"Thanks to you, comrade, in this cold weather..." The mother wanted to say something, but she couldn't say it for a moment.

　　"It's okay, as long as the child is alive!" Zheng Dongliang stopped her, "Hurry up! Warm the child up."

　　The mother held the child and stared at the naval comrade for a while, before going home with infinite gratitude.

　　Thus, the story of a naval comrade jumping into the sea to rescue a child quickly spread in this area. (Chunxing)

    热爱和关心人民的解放军
    英雄们征服了“抓抓岩”
      “抓抓岩”是四川省南部雷波县至上田坝一带彝胞来往必经的一个地方。
    二十年前，这里有一条小道可供通行，但彝胞为了避免蒋匪军的掠夺，就把这条小道炸毁了。以后，人们要通过这里，必须用手抓住岩上的石孔一步步地爬过去，稍不小心，就会掉在三十丈深的岩下，葬送在滚滚的金沙江里。因此，彝族人民把这个地方叫做“抓抓岩”。在这里，还流传着这样两句话：“‘抓抓岩’上眼泪流成河，岩下的尸骨比石头多。”可见，这里不知葬送过多少彝族同胞的性命。
    一九五三年的八月二日，人民解放军某部工兵排来到了这里，他们要在“抓抓岩”上开辟一条道路。任务是十分艰巨的。这里不但完全是悬崖绝壁，而且全是坚硬的岩石，重锤打下去，也只留下一个白印子，必须打下炮眼，炸掉顽石，才能修路。但岩上又无立足之地，战士们就用绳子吊着在半空中操作，有些地方连腰都不能直起，只能跪着打。很多人手上打起了泡，膝盖磨破了皮，可是他们不叫苦，不休息，继续紧张劳动。战士们说：“我们迟缓一天，彝胞就要多受一天苦！”二班班长董忠来一只手叫重锤打伤了，副排长要他休息，他说：“我虽然一只手不能抡大锤，但还可以掌炮钎啊。”为了提高工作效率，战士们就找窍门，想办法。杨志书同志想出改线的办法后，节省了五十多个工。他们还实行轮流吃饭的办法，使每天能多做三个多钟头的工作。彝胞被解放军这种英雄行为所感动，也纷纷送柴送水，送木料，送蔬菜支援他们。到八月二十一日，一条宽一公尺到两公尺的道路就在“抓抓岩”上出现了，为了保证彝胞通过这里时绝对安全，战士们还在路边上架起了一道坚固的木栏杆，从此，彝胞就自由自在地通过这里。盐巴、布匹和日用品也源源地运到彝胞居住的地区，使彝胞的生活得到了改善。他们在这条路上一碰到解放军，就伸出大拇指赞不绝口地说：“大军瓦瓦瓦（解放军顶好）！”（李大中）
    给渔民打开了“文化大门”
    一封书信寄到了某海岛上。这是渔民李文传的二弟从朝鲜写来的。李文传手拿着信，给父亲结结巴巴地念着，他父亲听着，不由得捋着胡子笑了起来。这位老大爷做梦也没想到在这短短的二十多天里，他的儿子就能认这么多字。他从箱子里取出一本旧账本，急忙跑到教员王忠槐同志那里，要叫王忠槐把生字给他抄在账本上，回去学习。他说：“我也要学文化，就算一天学一个，一年也能学三百多个，时间长了，一定也能看老二的来信，还要亲手写信给他，叫他为人民立功！”
    王忠槐是驻岛部队的一个海军战士，他和别的战士一样，在文化大进军中才学会了读书写字。他说：“我有了文化，也要叫渔民不当‘睁眼瞎’才能更好地建设祖国！”因此，他就和全班战士一块，建议上级要在这里创办一个学校，教附近几家渔民识字。上级和当地区人民政府同意了他们的意见，并且还发给了他们一些粉笔和书本，由王忠槐担任教员。
    附近几家渔民的青年和儿童都来上学了。没有教室，战士们就把自己的寝室当课堂；岛上买纸困难，王忠槐就发动学员们到山上去挖石板，用石板练习写字。在教学中，王忠槐十分耐心，学员不懂的地方，他就细心给他们讲解。有时他得了病，还坚持教学。学员们的学习热情也很高。一个名叫春生的学员，是个十一岁的孩子，家离学习的地方比较远些，但每天都来得很早，刮风下雨也没缺过课。李文传是一个比较好的学员，他在地里干活，身上也不离单字本，休息时就拿出来念。有时，他扛着柴，嘴里还不停地念着：“勹丫八——八路军的八”。他说：“我要是学不好文化，不要说对不起毛主席，连教员也对不起！”就这样，经过了二十多天的学习时间，他已经能够大体上阅读他二弟的来信了。　（顾敏）
    只要孩子活着
    清晨，海很静，可是它仿佛比兴风作浪的时候，更显得深沉和辽阔。
    刚刚是上午八点钟，郑东梁同志就忙着检查射击器材。他低着头，仔细打扫着靶上的泥巴。
    海岸上也静悄悄的，仅仅码头上有五六个孩子在蹦蹦跳跳地玩耍。他们拣起石子，用力往海里投去，石子溅起来的水花，惹得孩子们格格地发笑。郑东梁不由得被这愉快的笑声所打动，他不时抬起头朝孩子们望望，嘴角上也露出了微笑。他自言自语地说：“孩子们多幸福，多可爱呀！”
    突然，孩子们绝望地尖叫声传了过来，他急忙放下靶，跑上码头，才知道是一个小女孩掉到海里了。他连衣服也没顾得脱，就朝着孩子落水的地方跳进了海里。
    郑东梁在水里潜游着，摸索着，一分钟、两分钟，他不时地把头伸出水面，找寻着孩子的下落。突然，那边海水微微一冒，两条小辫子露出来了。他箭一般地游去，伸手就托起那个女孩来。
    孩子的母亲得到了这个消息，像疯了一样地跑来了。她的脸上吓得像蜡一样黄，话也说不出来。她从郑东梁怀里把孩子接过去，看看孩子冻紫了的嘴唇，看看面前那位军服不住往下淌水的海军同志，她的眼眶红了，热泪一滴滴地掉在孩子的脸上。
   “快叫孩子暖暖吧。不要哭了，孩子没危险了！”郑东梁安慰着女孩的母亲。
  “亏了你，同志，这大冷天气……”母亲还想说什么，但她又一时说不出来。
    “没关系，只要孩子活着啊！”郑东梁拦住她的话，“赶快吧！把孩子暖一暖去。”
    母亲抱着孩子，对着这个海军同志怔怔地望了一会，才怀着无限感激的心情回家去了。
    于是，一个海军同志跳海救出一个小孩的故事就在这一带迅速地传了开来。　（春兴）
