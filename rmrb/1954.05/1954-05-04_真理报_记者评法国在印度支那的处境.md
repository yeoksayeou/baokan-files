Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: *Pravda* published an article by its Geneva correspondent on the 3rd, commenting on news in the bourgeois press regarding the desperate situation of the French expeditionary force in Indochina. The commentary pointed out that many bourgeois newspapers have had to admit, first and foremost, that the people of Indochina have effectively controlled almost the entire territory of Indochina. *Le Monde* published a map of Indochina that clearly shows that the expeditionary force only occupies a small portion of the region, with the rest entirely controlled by the people of Indochina and its army.

	Such acknowledgements by the bourgeois press are of great significance, as they thoroughly refute the pathetic attempts by some to try and portray the Bao Dai puppet government as "legitimate" while branding the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has the support of the vast majority of the people, as "rebels." Any slightly well-informed and objective newspaper cannot but admit that the French expeditionary force has been repeatedly defeated by the Vietnamese People's Army. The colonialist expeditionary force is in a critical state. French and American newspapers heavily publicized the so-called "Navarre Plan." This plan, drafted by a French general and endorsed by Washington, attempted to achieve a "military victory" in the short term. But now, even some French and American commentators believe that the "Navarre Plan" is failing. In response to a series of demonstrative offensives launched under the "Navarre Plan," the command of the Vietnamese People's Army counterattacked, not only encircling Dien Bien Phu, but also threatening other positions of the French expeditionary force in Indochina. Robert Guillain, a *Le Monde* reporter who had visited Indochina, wrote with unease about the serious losses of the French army, especially officers: "The French army can no longer recover. It is gradually collapsing. Just think! Previously, we only lost one graduating class from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in a year, but now, we are losing three classes in two years."

	French newspapers openly admit that relying on the Bao Dai puppet army is clearly a failure. *L'Observateur* wrote: "The Bao Dai army is only a symbol. Less than 50,000 of them are capable of fighting. It is practically impossible to find Vietnamese to serve as infantry cadres, impossible to find those who are willing to fight their own compatriots."

	The *Pravda* correspondent continued that the Vietnamese People's Army is a completely different story, they understand why they are fighting. The French right-wing newspaper *L'Aurore* admitted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "is a first-rate political and military organization." *L'Observateur* added that the combat effectiveness of the Vietnamese People's Army is increasing daily. The paper pointed out the critical situation of the French expeditionary force and condemned the plans of American ruling circles and certain French groups to expand the war in Indochina. *Le Monde* pointed out that American intervention in this war would not bring any good results. The paper wrote: American intervention does not extricate our army, but requires us to undertake heavier obligations and become more deeply involved in this war. *Le Monde* concluded that continuing the war in Indochina would lead our army to ruin. Most newspaper observers link the situation in Indochina with the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and concluded that peace in Indochina can only be restored as soon as possible through consultations with the participation of all relevant countries. French and Swiss newspaper observers, based on the actual situation in Indochina, reached another equally important conclusion: Only with the participation of representatives from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can the issue of restoring peace in Indochina be effectively discussed.

	The *Pravda* correspondent concluded: A peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, under the conditions of guaranteeing the freedom and national rights of the Indochinese people, will be a major victory for the cause of peace.

    “真理报”记者评法国在印度支那的处境
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”三日刊载驻日内瓦记者的文章，评论资产阶级报纸报道关于法国在印度支那的远征军绝望处境的消息。评论中指出，许多资产阶级报纸不得不首先承认，印度支那人民实际上几乎已控制了印度支那的全部地区。“世界报”上刊载了印度支那的一幅地图，由这幅地图可以明显地看出：远征军仅占有一小部分地区，其余的全部地区都已为印度支那人民和它的军队所控制。
    资产阶级报纸这样一些承认有着重大的意义，因为这些承认彻底驳倒了某些人的可怜的企图，他们企图硬把保大傀儡政府说成是“合法的”，而把得到绝大多数人民支持的越南民主共和国说成是
  “叛党”。只要是稍为消息灵通的、客观的报纸都不能不承认：法国远征军接连地为越南人民军所挫败。殖民者的远征军正处于危急状态中。法国和美国的报纸曾大事宣传过所谓“纳瓦尔计划”。这个企图在短期内取得“军事胜利”的计划是法国将军所草拟，而为华盛顿所赞同的。而现在，甚至一些法国和美国的评论员都认为，“纳瓦尔计划”正在破产。越南人民军司令部针对根据“纳瓦尔计划”发动的一系列示威性进攻作了反击，结果不仅包围了奠边府，而且威胁到法国远征军在印度支那的其他阵地。曾访问过印度支那的“世界报”记者罗伯·纪兰不安地写到法军特别是军官的严重损失说：“法军再复兴不起来了。它逐渐垮了。请想一想吧！以前我们在一年中间只损失圣西尔军校的一届毕业生，而现在，二年中间就要损失三批毕业生。”
    法国报纸公开承认，指望保大傀儡军队是显然要落空的。“法兰西观察家”周报写道：“保大军队只是一种象征。其中能作战的不到五万人。实际上不可能找到越南人来充当步兵干部，不可能找到那些准备和自己同胞搏斗的人。”
    “真理报”记者继续说，越南人民军完全是另一种情况，他们了解为什么要作战。法国右翼报纸“震旦报”承认：越南民主共和国“是头等的政治组织和军事组织”。“法兰西观察家”周报补充说：越南人民军部队的战斗力日益加强。该报指出了法国远征军的危急情况，并谴责美国统治集团和法国某些集团策划扩大印度支那战争的计划。“世界报”指出，美国干涉这个战争，不会带来什么好结果。该报写道：美国的干涉并不是使我们的军队脱身，而是要求我们承担更重的义务，更深地卷入这场战争中去。“世界报”最后说，继续进行印度支那的战争，将使我们军队走向毁灭。大多数报纸的观察家把印度支那的局势和日内瓦外长会议联系在一起，得出了这样的结论：只有在一切有关国家参加下进行协商，才能尽速恢复印度支那的和平。法国和瑞士报纸的观察家根据印度支那的实际情况，得出另一个同样重要的结论说：只有越南民主共和国的代表参加会议，才能有效地讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    “真理报”记者最后写道：在保障印度支那人民自由和民族权利的条件下和平解决印度支那问题，将是和平事业的重大胜利。
