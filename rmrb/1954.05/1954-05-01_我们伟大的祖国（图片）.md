Our Great Motherland
　　Benxi is a "city of coal and iron" in our country. It has abundant low-phosphorus coking coal seams and iron ore, and also stores large amounts of limestone, pyrite and more than a dozen other raw materials for smelting pig iron and steel. This is a picture of the skips carrying raw materials for ironmaking, being transported from the mine to the ironmaking plant along the aerial ropeway.
