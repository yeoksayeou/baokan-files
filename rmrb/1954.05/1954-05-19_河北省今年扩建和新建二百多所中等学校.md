    河北省今年扩建和新建二百多所中等学校
    河北省今年将扩建和新建二百六十四所中等学校。目前，唐山、通县、石家庄、邯郸等地区已有五十多处中等学校工程动工，其余工程也将陆续兴工，预定今年年底前完工。这些工程完工后，河北省中等学校的在校学生将由现在的十七万一千人发展到二十一万九千人。
    今年河北省扩建和新建中等学校的投资较一九五二年增加近一倍。去年年底前，河北省人民政府已用巨额资金完成了四十五万平方公尺的中等学校建筑工程，使这个省的中等学校由一九四九年的一百八十九处增到三百五十七处；在校中学生人数也由一九四九年的五万三千多人增加到一九五三年底的十七万一千多人。河北省并特别注意了中等技术学校的发展工作。工业、农业、财经、卫生等中等技术学校由一九四九年的七处增加到现在的十八处，在校学生人数增加了五倍。
    河北省中等学校，四年来，输送了数千名中学毕业生到高等学校学习，还有六万多个初中、师范和中等技术学校的毕业生积极参加了祖国的工业、农业、财经、教育和卫生建设。　（新华社）
