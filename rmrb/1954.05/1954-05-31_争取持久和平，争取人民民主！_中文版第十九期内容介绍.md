    “Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!” Chinese Edition, Issue 19 - Content Introduction
    The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1954, Issue 19, has been published.
    This issue features an editorial titled "Beneficial Historical Lessons" to commemorate Victory over Germany Day. The editorial points out: Nine years have passed since the great victory of defeating Hitler's fascism. As a result of defeating Hitler's fascism and Japanese militarism, the entire international situation has undergone fundamental changes. The forces of socialism and democracy have grown stronger, and the positions of imperialism and reactionaries have been weakened. The people of all countries' desire for peace has become the banner and powerful driving force of our time. However, the American reactionaries are now following Hitler's old path. They disregard the desire for peace of the people of all countries and do not want to accept beneficial historical lessons. Currently, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is discussing the most pressing issues related to consolidating peace in Asia. Powerful groups in the United States are trying their best to prevent the national liberation movements of the Asian people, plotting to put together aggressive blocs, and expanding the war in Indochina. However, no force can stop the historical development of the Asian countries. The editorial emphasizes that whoever does not accept historical lessons will be subject to painful punishment.
    Important articles published in this issue include: "The Great Power of the Unbreakable Friendship of Free Peoples" by T. Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; "French Peasants Fight for Their Vital Interests" by V. Rochet, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party; and "Strive to Ease International Tensions, Strive for Freedom and Social Progress" by L. Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party.
    Rochet's article points out: The struggle of the French peasants reached a huge scale in 1953 and the first few months of 1954. The peasants adopted various forms of struggle that had never been used in France before. The direct reason for the anger of the peasant masses was the sharp reduction in the prices of their products and the decrease in sales. All this is a consequence of the policies of successive governments since 1947 in implementing the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact, which sell out French independence. The working farmers of France have risen up against this policy that makes them poor and bankrupt. They have increasingly clearly recognized the necessity of completely changing the policy, and therefore are uniting with the working class to oppose the reactionary and war-mongering government that puts them in extreme poverty.
    Longo's article points out: Since the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the rulers of the United States and Western European countries, in order to make the international situation develop in the direction they expect, have been accelerating the implementation of their war preparation plans, and trying to force Italy and France to immediately ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty. The Italian "European Defense Community" supporters who listen only to the United States are trying to force the parliament to blindly approve this treaty. Under such circumstances, all members and organizations of the Italian Communist Party must strengthen and expand the movement against the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty, making the movement a unified, large-scale mass movement. Longo said: Preventing the ratification of this treaty not only means that we are working to ease international tensions and consolidate peace, but also means that we are working to defend the people's freedom and defend social progress.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第十九期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十九期已经出版。
    本期以“有益的历史教训”为题发表社论，纪念对德胜利日。社论指出：自从击溃希特勒法西斯主义而取得伟大胜利以来，已经九年了。由于战胜了希特勒法西斯主义和日本军国主义，整个国际形势起了根本的变化。社会主义和民主的力量壮大了，帝国主义和反动派的阵地削弱了。各国人民要求和平的愿望已经成为当代的旗帜和强大的动力。但是，美国反动派现在正走着希特勒的老路。他们无视各国人民要求和平的意愿，不想接受有益的历史教训。目前日内瓦外长会议正在讨论有关巩固亚洲和平的最迫切的问题。美国有势力的集团却在竭力阻遏亚洲人民的民族解放运动，策划拼凑侵略集团和扩大印度支那战争。但是，任何力量都不能阻止亚洲各国人民的历史发展。社论强调说：谁不接受历史教训，谁就得受到痛苦的惩罚。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记托·日夫科夫的“自由人民牢不可破的友谊的伟大力量”，法国共产党政治局委员瓦·罗歇的“法国农民为切身利益而斗争”和意大利共产党副总书记路·隆哥的“争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取自由和社会进步”。
    罗歇的文章指出：法国农民的斗争在一九五三年和一九五四年头几个月达到了巨大的规模。农民采取了在法国从来没有用过的各种斗争方式。引起农民群众愤怒的直接原因是他们的产品的价格急剧降低和销路减少。而这一切都是一九四七年以来历届政府执行马歇尔计划和大西洋公约这种出卖法国独立的政策的后果。法国劳动农民已经起来反对这种使他们贫穷和破产的政策。他们已经日益清楚地认识到彻底改变政策的必要性，因此正在和工人阶级联合起来反对使他们陷入极端贫困的反动和战争的政府。
    隆哥的文章指出：自柏林四国外长会议举行以来，美国和西欧国家的统治者为了使国际局势朝着他们所期望的方向发展，一直在加速推行他们的准备战争的计划，力图强迫意大利和法国立即批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。唯美国之命是听的意大利的“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者们，企图强使议会盲目地批准这个条约。在这样的情况下，意大利共产党的全体党员和党组织必须加强和扩大反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的运动，使运动成为一个统一的、大规模的群众运动。隆哥说：阻止批准这个条约，不仅意味着我们是在为缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平而努力，而且也意味着我们是在为保卫人民的自由和保卫社会进步而努力。　（新华社）
