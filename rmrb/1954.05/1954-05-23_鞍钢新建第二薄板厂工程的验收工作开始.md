Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 22nd: Acceptance work has begun on Anshan Iron and Steel Company's new Second Thin Plate Mill, which is nearing completion.

Under the guidance of Soviet experts, over one hundred technicians and leading cadres are conducting the acceptance work for the Second Thin Plate Mill. They are divided into more than ten specialized acceptance groups based on the nature of the work, such as civil engineering, mechanical installation, etc. The acceptance procedure for this project, like that of the large Rolling Mill and Seamless Steel Tube Plant completed last year, requires extremely precise standards. The results of the acceptance prove that the installation quality of these machines has reached the standards required by the Soviet construction drawings. The word "Excellent" is written in the quality evaluation column of all acceptance sheets.

Currently, the machinery that has completed technical completion is undergoing no-load testing, while the remaining machinery is still undergoing partial testing. Various water, air, oil, gas, and other pipelines, which snake through the air or underground of the entire plant, are undergoing pressure testing and acceptance.

    鞍钢新建第二薄板厂工程的验收工作开始
    【新华社鞍山二十二日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建第二薄板厂快要完工，工程的验收工作已经开始。
    第二薄板厂的验收工作，在苏联专家的指导下，由一百多个技术人员和领导干部，按土木建筑、机械安装等工程性质，组成十多个专业验收小组分别进行。这个工程的验收程序，和去年建设完成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂验收时一样，要求的标准十分精密。验收的结果证明，这些机械的安装质量都达到了苏联作的施工图要求的标准。在所有验收单的质量评定栏内，都写着“优等”两字。
    现在，已作过技术竣工的机械又开始了无负荷试车，其余的机械仍在进行局部试车。盘蜒在全厂空中或地下的各种水、风、油、瓦斯等管道，正在进行试压验收。
