    The Soviet Union is Building New Large Hydropower Stations
    By our correspondent Li He
    The Soviet Union is dedicated to peaceful construction, developing the national economy, and maximizing the satisfaction of the people's material and cultural needs. This is evident in the construction of hydropower stations alone. Almost every year, the construction of large hydropower stations begins, and almost every month, small and medium-sized hydropower stations are completed and generate electricity. The progress of hydropower station construction has become a constantly inspiring piece of good news in the Soviet Union's peaceful construction.
    The construction projects of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station on the Volga River (with a generating capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts), the Stalingrad Hydropower Station (with a generating capacity of 1.7 million kilowatts), and the Kakhovka Hydropower Station on the Dnieper River (with a generating capacity of 250,000 kilowatts) are actively underway.
    Hydropower station construction is bustling in various regions of the Soviet Union. The Shcherbakov Hydropower Station in the Kazakh Republic, the Gyumush Hydropower Station in the Armenian Republic, and the first part of the Mingachevir Hydropower Station in the Azerbaijan Republic were all completed in 1953. In the Georgian Republic, the construction of new hydropower stations such as the Ortochala, Gumat, Rion, Tkibuli, etc., has begun, which will double the power generation capacity and increase the power output by one and a half times. In the Estonian Republic, the Narva Hydropower Station is being built using waterfalls; it will supply Estonia and the Leningrad Oblast with supplementary electricity, and its dam and the 200-square-kilometer Narva Lake will raise the water level of the Narva River to improve waterway transportation. In the Moldavian Republic, the Dubossary Hydropower Station buildings are rising on the left bank of the Dniester River, and turbines are being installed; this hydropower station will increase Moldova's electricity by about two times.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in the Soviet Union stipulates the completion of the Kama River Hydropower Station, the Gorky Hydropower Station, the Mingachevir Hydropower Station, the Shcherbakov Hydropower Station, etc.; these regional large hydropower stations will generate a total of 1,916,000 kilowatts. The Fifth Five-Year Plan also stipulates the beginning of the utilization of the Angara River's water power. Currently, forty regional large hydropower stations are being built on various rivers in the Soviet Union.
    The Kama River Hydropower Station is being actively built near Molotov City in the western Urals. More than 400,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete have been poured during the construction of the spillway dam. The hydropower station will supply the region's metallurgy, machine manufacturing, mining, chemical, logging, food, and other industries and agriculture with millions of kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity. The reservoir of the hydropower station has an area of 200,000 hectares and is more than 250 kilometers long (excluding tributaries). This will help deepen the river and facilitate navigation. The design of this hydropower station is new, and people will not see the hydropower station buildings on the riverbank. The power generating machines are installed directly inside the spillway dam. According to hydraulic engineers, this not only saves building materials and shortens construction time but also increases power generation capacity during floods. The water gate of this hydropower station was opened on May Day, and the first part of the project will generate electricity in the third quarter.
    The Gorky Hydropower Station is being built on the Volga River near Gorky City. The hydropower station will supply the region's chemical, metal processing, leather, logging, paper-making, and other industries, as well as the agriculture of Gorky Oblast and Arzamas Oblast, with more electricity. Due to the construction of the hydropower station, the water level of the upper reaches of the Volga River will be raised by 18 meters, becoming a deep-water navigation line. The hydropower station's project includes reinforced concrete spillway dams, hydropower station buildings, more than 18 kilometers of earth dams, and water gates. A total of 50 million cubic meters of earth must be backfilled for the dams, about 1.5 million cubic meters of reinforced concrete must be poured for the buildings, 100,000 tons of steel frames must be erected, and 23,000 tons of metal structures must be installed. Construction workers are launching competitions. They will block the Volga Riverbed within September without interrupting navigation and put the first turbine into operation in December. Therefore, in the spring and summer of this year, the scale of construction and installation work will be doubled compared to last year. They will excavate and fill 17 million cubic meters of soil for the dams, pour 500,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete for the buildings, and install 14,000 tons of metal structures and hydraulic machinery and equipment.
    The Bukhtarma Hydropower Station has begun construction in the northeastern part of the Kazakh Republic where the Bukhtarma River flows into the Irtysh River. It is very close to the Shcherbakov Hydropower Station built on the Irtysh River. The huge power of the Bukhtarma Hydropower Station will supply many mines in Altai and will fully mechanize the production of hundreds of collective farms and state farms in Altai, eastern Kazakhstan, and western Siberia. The reinforced concrete dam of the hydropower station, which will be built in a few years, is about 100 meters high. It will block the water flow and impound a large reservoir directly reaching Lake Zaysan. Therefore, Lake Zaysan will extend to 550 kilometers, and the water level will rise by 10 meters. In this way, from this inland lake, it will be possible to navigate to the Arctic Ocean via the Irtysh River and the Ob River; Altai can obtain timber from Siberia via waterway and transport grain and livestock products from eastern Kazakhstan; the land in eastern Kazakhstan can also extensively use the Irtysh River water for irrigation.
    The Novosibirsk Hydropower Station has begun construction on the Ob River near Novosibirsk City. The Ob River is one of the largest rivers in Siberia. It and its tributary, the Irtysh River, both contain abundant water power. Many hydropower stations will be built on the Ob River. The Novosibirsk Hydropower Station is considered the first. The powerful electricity of the hydropower station will be used to further develop the national economy of Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai, and will enable large-scale electrification of the Siberian railway trunk line. Due to the construction of the hydropower station, the navigation of the Ob River will be greatly improved. The constructed reservoir has an area of about 1,300 square kilometers and is 200 kilometers long. As of the end of March, more than 10 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. A feature of this hydropower station construction design is that the concrete project is relatively small. Because special drainage holes will be installed inside the hydropower station buildings, the length of the spillway dam can be shortened.
    The Irkutsk Hydropower Station has begun construction on the Angara River near Irkutsk. The Angara River flows out of Lake Baikal. The potential power generation of this river exceeds the sum of the Volga River, the Kama River, the Dnieper River, and the Don River. Because Lake Baikal serves as a natural inland sea reservoir, the water level of the Angara River is very balanced throughout the year. According to surveys, many hydropower stations can be built on this river, generating about 65 billion kilowatt-hours per year (about half of the total power generation of the Soviet Union in 1953). The hydropower station's project includes hydropower station buildings and earth dams. A special feature of this project is that no reinforced concrete spillway dams are built. Excess water will be discharged from special channels installed inside the hydropower station buildings. The earth dams of the hydropower station will not only equalize the water level of the upper reaches of the Angara River with Lake Baikal but also raise the water level of Lake Baikal. After the completion of the Irkutsk Hydropower Station, it will generate twice the amount of electricity as the Dnieper Hydropower Station (one of the largest hydropower stations in the world). Its great significance for the development of the local and surrounding economies is conceivable.
    All these large hydropower stations that are completed or started construction within the Fifth Five-Year Plan are being built with powerful mechanized technical equipment and with the support of the entire Soviet Union. Worker areas, automated concrete factories, steel frame structure factories, mechanical repair shops, lumber yards, and quarries are emerging near each construction site. Giant excavators, dredgers, cranes, and transportation vehicles are active on each site. Hundreds of enterprises continuously supply the construction sites with machines and building materials. Engineers, technicians, and workers have been sent from all over the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet Union's emphasis on hydropower station construction is not accidental. The Soviet Union is a vast and resource-rich country, possessing many rivers with powerful power generation potential. (According to statistics, these rivers can generate a total of 1.7 trillion kilowatt-hours per year). The Soviet Union is an industrialized country, possessing the machines, cadres, funds, and experience necessary to build hydropower stations. The Soviet Union is building a communist society, which needs richer electricity to meet the growing needs of industry, transportation, agriculture, and the people's lives. (In addition, according to Soviet experience, the cost of each kilowatt of electricity generated by hydropower stations is lower than that of thermal power plants because thermal power plants also have to calculate the cost of coal.) Therefore, the Soviet Union's continuous construction of new hydropower stations not only reflects that people can fully enjoy natural resources in a socialist society but also shows that the Soviet Union is moving towards a highly electrified communist society.

    苏联在建筑新的大水电站
    本报记者　李何
    苏联在致力和平建设，以发展国民经济和尽量满足人民的物质和文化的需要。仅仅从建筑水电站这件事上，就可以看得很清楚。几乎每年都有大水电站开始建筑，几乎每月都有中小型水电站完工发电。水电站建筑的进程，成为苏联和平建设中一项经常鼓舞人心的喜讯。
    伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站（将发电二百一十万瓩）、斯大林格勒水电站（将发电一百七十万瓩）和第聂伯河上的卡霍夫卡水电站（将发电二十五万瓩）的建筑工程，在积极进行着。
    在苏联各个区域，沸腾着水电站的建筑工作。在哈萨克共和国的石山口水电站，在亚美尼亚共和国的久木什水电站，在阿塞拜疆共和国的明基卡乌尔水电站的第一部分，都在一九五三年完工。在格鲁吉亚共和国，现在开始建筑奥尔塔察、古马特、拉扎努尔、特其布尔等等新水电站，它们将使格鲁吉亚水电站发电力增加一倍，产电量增加一倍半。在爱沙尼亚共和国，利用瀑布建筑着纳瓦水电站；它将供给爱沙尼亚和列宁格勒州以补充的电力，它的正在构筑的堤坝和二百平方公里的纳瓦湖，将提高纳瓦河的水位，以改善水路运输。在摩尔达维亚共和国，在德聂斯特尔河左岸兴起着杜波萨尔水电站建筑物，同时安装着水轮机；这座水电站将使摩尔达维亚电力增加约两倍。
    苏联发展国民经济的第五个五年计划规定，要建成卡马河水电站、高尔基水电站、明基卡乌尔水电站、石山口水电站等等；这些区域性的大水电站，总共将发电一百九十一万六千瓩。第五个五年计划也规定，要开始利用安加拉河的水力。现在苏联各个河流上，兴建着四十座区域性的大水电站。
    卡马河水电站，在乌拉尔西部莫洛托夫城附近积极建筑着。在构筑溢水坝时浇灌了四十多万立方公尺的钢筋混凝土。水电站将供给这个区域的冶金、机器制造、采矿、化学、伐木、食品等工业和农业以几百万瓩时的便宜的电力。水电站的水库，面积有二十万公顷，长二百五十多公里（不包括支流）。这将帮助加深河水，便利航运。这个水电站的设计是新式的，在河岸上人们将看不见水电站建筑物。发电机器直接安装在溢水坝的里面。据研究水力的人们说，这样不但可以节省建筑材料，缩短建筑时间，而且可以在洪水期间提高发电能力。这个水电站的水闸在五一节开放，第一部分工程将在第三季发电。
    高尔基水电站，在高尔基城附近伏尔加河上建筑着。水电站将供给这个区域的化学、金属加工、皮革、伐木、造纸等等工业以及高尔基州和阿尔扎马州的农业以更多的电力。由于建筑水电站，伏尔加河上游一段水位将提高十八公尺，而成为深水的航运线。水电站的工程包括钢筋混凝土的溢水坝、水电站建筑物、十八公里多长的土坝、水闸。总共要为堤坝掩土填土五千万立方公尺，要为建筑物浇灌约一百五十万立方公尺钢筋混凝土、建立十万吨钢架、装设二万三千吨金属结构。建筑工人们展开竞赛。他们要在九月份内不中断航运地堵住伏尔加河床，在十二月使第一部水轮机开工。所以在今年春夏季，建筑和安装工作的规模要比去年扩大一倍。他们要为堤坝挖填一千七百万立方公尺土，为建筑物浇灌五十万立方公尺钢筋混凝土，安装一万四千吨金属结构和水力机械设备。
    布克塔马水电站，在哈萨克共和国东北部布克塔马山河泻入额尔齐斯河处开始建筑。它离在额尔齐斯河上建成的石山口水电站很近。布克塔马水电站的巨大电力将供给阿尔泰的许多矿山，将使阿尔泰、哈萨克斯坦东部和西伯利亚西部的几百个集体农庄和国营农场的生产完全机械化。几年后筑成的水电站钢筋混凝土堤坝，高约一百公尺，它将堵住水流，拦蓄出直达到查伊桑湖的大水库。因此查伊桑湖将延长到五百五十公里，水位将提高十公尺。这样，从这个内湖可以经过额尔齐斯河、鄂毕河，通航到北冰洋；阿尔泰可以经过水路从西伯利亚得到木材，从东哈萨克斯坦运来粮食和畜产品；东哈萨克斯坦的土地也可以广泛地引用额尔齐斯河水来灌溉。
    新西伯利亚水电站，在新西伯利亚城附近鄂毕河上开始建筑。鄂毕河是西伯利亚最大河流之一。它和它的支流额尔齐斯河都蕴藏着丰富的水力。在鄂毕河上将建筑许多水电站。新西伯利亚水电站算是第一座。水电站的强大电力将用来进一步发展新西伯利亚州和阿尔泰边疆的国民经济，将使西伯利亚铁路干线大规模地电气化。由于建筑水电站，鄂毕河的航运将大大改善。构筑的水库面积约一千三百平方公里，长二百公里。截至三月底，已经完成一千多万立方公尺以上的土工。这个水电站建筑设计有一个特点，就是混凝土工程比较不大。因为在水电站建筑物内部将装置特制的排水孔，所以可以缩短溢水坝的长度。
    伊尔库次克水电站，在伊尔库次克附近安加拉河上开始建筑。安加拉河河水是从贝加尔湖流出的。这条河潜在的发电的水力超过伏尔加河、卡马河、第聂伯河、顿河的总和。因为有贝加尔湖这样天然内海作水库，安加拉河全年水位都很均衡。据勘察，这条河可以盖起许多水电站，每年可以发电约六百五十亿瓩时（约一九五三年全苏联发电量的一半）。水电站的工程包括水电站建筑物和土堤坝。这个工程特别的地方是不筑钢筋混凝土的溢水坝。多余的水将从装置在水电站建筑物里面的特装孔道排出。水电站的土堤坝不仅将使安加拉河上游的水位与贝加尔湖平等，而且将提高贝加尔湖的水位。伊尔库次克水电站完工后，将发出两倍于第聂伯河水电站（世界上最大的水电站之一）的电量。它对于发展当地及其周围的经济的重大意义，可想而知。
    所有这些在第五个五年计划内完工或开始建筑的大水电站，都是用强大的机械化的技术设备，都是在苏联全国支援之下，进行建筑的。各个工地附近出现着工人区、自动化混凝土工厂、钢架结构工厂、机械修理厂、木材厂和采石场。各个工地上活动着巨型的掘土机、吸泥机、起重机和运输工具。几百个企业源源不绝地供给工地以机器和建筑材料。从全苏各地送去了工程师、技师和工人。
    苏联重视水电站的建筑不是偶然的。苏联是地大物博的，它拥有许多蕴藏着强大发电潜力的河流。（据统计，这些河流总共每年可以发电一万七千亿瓩时）。苏联是工业化了的国家，它拥有建筑水电站所必需的机器、干部、资金和经验。苏联在建设共产主义社会，它需要更丰富的电力，以满足工业、运输业、农业以及人民生活上日益增长的需要。（此外，按照苏联经验，水力发电站所发的每瓩电力的成本，低于火力发电厂，因为火力发电厂还要计算煤的成本。）因此，苏联不断建筑新的水电站这件事，不但反映着在社会主义社会里人能够充分享用自然富源，而且显示着苏联在向高度电气化的共产主义社会迈进。（附图片）
