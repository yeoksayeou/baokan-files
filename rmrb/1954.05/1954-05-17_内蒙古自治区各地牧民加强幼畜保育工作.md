Herdsmen in various pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have basically completed lambing and have moved on to the work of rearing young livestock and large livestock calving. The earlier lambing areas of the Yikezhao League and Ulanqab League completed lambing before April 20; the later lambing areas of the Xilin Gol League, Chahar League, and Hulunbuir Grassland are also nearing completion.

After completing the lambing task, herdsmen in various places have now created a variety of methods to rear young livestock. In the Jiergalang area of ​​the Left Wing Rear Banner of Horqin, in order to supervise each other and ensure that all lambs grow up healthy and survive, a patriotic livestock protection competition has been launched between mutual aid teams and between herdsmen. In the Dalate Rear Banner, because ewes are weak and have no milk after giving birth, many herdsmen in the banner feed the ewes with concentrated feed to increase the milk production of the ewes; and they use milk and bean flour mixed into a paste to feed milk-deficient lambs. The herdsmen of the Wujintai Administrative Group of the Mingantai Right United Banner are more careful in raising young livestock. The administrative group, consisting of 38 households, has organized six lambing and rearing mutual aid teams, and has set up separate lamb pens and ewe pens to protect ewes and lambs. Newborn lambs are kept in warm pens for twelve days before being grazed outside. The herdsman Dingseng of the Eastern United Banner of Xilin Gol League, after receiving the feed airdropped by the Central People's Government, was determined to protect all lambs safely in order to repay Chairman Mao's concern. He prepared cold-proof warming equipment for the lambs. During the calving period, he not only herded with the flock, but also kept the ewes that were about to give birth at home every day; every night he put the newborn lambs in willow baskets in time to prevent the lambs from being frozen or crushed to death. As a result, none of the more than 200 lambs born in his family died.

In conjunction with the work of rearing young livestock, in order to further increase the number of large livestock and support national industrial and agricultural production, many pastoral and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas are carrying out the calving work of large livestock very carefully.

    内蒙古自治区各地牧民加强幼畜保育工作
    内蒙古自治区各牧业区和半农半牧区已基本上结束接产羊羔，转入保育幼畜和大牲畜接产工作。接羔季节较早的伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟等地，于四月二十日以前即完成了接羔工作；接羔季节较晚的锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟、呼伦贝尔草地，接羔工作目前也快要结束。
    各地牧民在完成接羔任务之后，现又创造出多种方法来保育幼畜。科尔沁左翼后旗吉尔嘎朗区的牧民为了互相督促，使全部幼羔健壮成活，在互助组与互助组、牧民与牧民之间展开了爱国保畜竞赛。达拉特后旗因母羊瘦弱产后无奶，该旗有不少牧民用精料喂母羊，增加母羊的奶汁；并用牛奶和豆面拌成糊糊喂缺奶的羊羔，明安太右联合旗乌金带行政小组的牧民，对饲养幼畜更加经心。该行政小组共三十八户牧民，组织了六个接羔保育互助组，为了保护母羊、羊羔、单独设立了羊羔圈和母羊圈。新生的幼羔，先放在暖圈里饲养十二天以后再放到外面放牧。锡林郭勒盟东部联合旗牧民顶僧，在得到中央人民政府用飞机空投下的饲料后，为了报答毛主席的关怀，他下决心保护幼羔只只安全。他为幼羔预备了抗御寒冷的保暖设备，接产期间他不仅跟群放牧，并且每天都把将生的母羊留在家里；每天夜里都把新生的幼羔及时放到柳条包里，避免幼羔被冻死或压死。因此，他家新生下的二百多只羊羔，没有一只死亡。
    结合着保育幼畜工作，不少牧业区和半农半牧区的牧民为了更多地增殖大牲畜，支援国家工农业生产，都在十分谨慎地进行着大牲畜的接产工作。
