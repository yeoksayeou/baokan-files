Maintain Close Ties with the Masses
By F. Beletnev, Representative of the Vilnius City Workers' Soviet and Head of the Workshop of the Vieteberg Fur Sewing Factory

The people of Lithuania live freely and happily in the unbreakable brotherly family of the Soviet nationalities. We rejoice in the yearly improvement of the material well-being and cultural level of the working people of the Republic. We are proud of the rapid development and beautification of our cities and villages. Each of us sees how remarkable improvements have been made in our industry, transportation, and agriculture.

In all our outstanding achievements, in completing the new and enormous tasks set by the beloved Communist Party and the Soviet government, the Workers' Soviet—the state power organ of the Soviet state—plays a truly great role. The responsibilities of the Soviet representatives are great and glorious, their scope of activities is broad, and they have endless possibilities to exert their creative initiative.

The Soviets say: "The representative is the servant of the people." This means that the primary duty of us Soviet representatives, the people's elected officials, is to strengthen the vital connection with the voters and meet the demands and wishes of the working people. Learning from the masses, listening to their voices, and consulting with them regularly—this is the sacred duty of every representative. As a representative of the Vilnius City Soviet, I also shoulder the responsibilities of a representative with great enthusiasm in close contact with the masses.

The Vieteberg Fur Sewing Factory elected me as a representative, giving me supreme honor. I have worked at the Vieteberg factory for many years and have risen from an ordinary worker to a workshop director. I will spare no effort to respond to the workers' trust in me. I want to help them in every way, just as they help me. The major task we must accomplish together is to improve production, increase the quantity of products, and improve their quality.

To work better and more efficiently, we have organized extensive production studies in the factory. Male and female workers persistently study theoretical knowledge of production and delve into advanced working methods. To satisfy the wishes of all workers, I and some advanced producers visited enterprises in Moscow. From the capital of the motherland, we brought back many new things to help us further improve labor productivity. For example, in the sewing workshop I lead, we have changed some manual operations to machines, significantly improving technical operations. This has lightened the labor of the female workers, allowing many to increase their production quotas by two to three times per shift.

Once, one of our female workers said to me—that is, to a representative—that she had not received a general education, and she asked, "Help me gain knowledge." So, with the help of the administration, we organized studies in the enterprise according to the teaching syllabus of general education. The teachers we hired—engineers and technicians—are very willing to help male and female workers study. It was impossible for male and female workers to study in the old bourgeois Lithuania. Closely contacting the people and studying their needs can help us, the Soviet representatives, better complete our tasks and promptly raise and solve urgent issues. I would like to cite such an example:

Last year, the Communist Party and the Soviet government formulated measures to further improve the people's welfare and passed resolutions on improving the level of Soviet trade work, which placed a specific task before the Workers' Soviets: to quickly and successfully implement the measures formulated by the Party. The Soviet representatives of the city of Vilnius, including myself, and the members of the City Soviet Standing Committee on Trade, as usual, requested the assistance of their voters, numerous worker activists, staff, and intellectuals. After actively discussing this issue, the city's residents also put forward many valuable suggestions, offered realistic criticisms of shortcomings, and reminded the leaders how to better organize the work of state-owned trade and collective farm trade in the city. Of course, our joint efforts were not in vain. Recently, many new shops, canteens, restaurants, and cafes have been added to the city, and customer service has also improved.

Thanks to the initiative and organizational work of the representatives, our city, like other cities in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, has not only seen significant improvements in trade but also achieved great success in housing and cultural life construction, national education, and health care.

Improving the organizational work of local Soviets and increasing the enthusiasm of Soviet representatives—the people's loyal servants—will enable our republic and our motherland to achieve more outstanding results in all sectors of the national economy and culture and in further improving the welfare of the Soviet people.

    密切联系群众
    苏联维尔纽斯市劳动者代表  苏维埃代表维且别尔格皮毛缝纫工厂车间主任  弗·别列得涅涅
    立陶宛人民自由幸福地生活在苏维埃各民族的牢不可破的兄弟大家庭里。我们为共和国劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的逐年提高而欢欣。我们为我们的城市和农村的这样迅速发展和美化而自豪。我们每个人都看见在我们的工业、运输业和农业方面已有了多么显著的改进。
    在我们的所有的卓越的成就中，在完成亲爱的共产党和苏联政府所制定的新的巨大任务中，劳动者代表苏维埃——苏维埃国家的国家政权机关起着真正巨大的作用。苏维埃代表的责任是伟大的、光荣的，他们的活动范围是广阔的，他们有无穷尽的可能来发挥自己的创造主动性。
    苏联人说：“代表是人民的勤务员”。这就是说，我们苏维埃代表、人民的当选者的首要职责就是巩固和选民们的生动联系，满足劳动人民的要求和愿望。向群众学习，倾听群众的声音，经常地和群众商量。这就是每个代表的神圣职责。我—维尔纽斯市苏维埃代表，也以巨大的热情在密切联系群众的情况下担负起了代表的职责。
    维且别尔格皮毛缝纫工厂选举我为代表，给了我无上的荣誉。我在维且别尔格工厂工作了很多年，并已从一个普通的女工升为车间主任。我将不惜一切力量来回答工人们对我的信托。我要像他们帮助我一样地在一切方面帮助他们。我们所要共同完成的重大任务就是改进生产，增加产品数量，并提高其质量。
    为了更好地和更有效率地工作，我们在工厂里组织了广泛的生产学习。男女工人们坚持地学习生产的理论知识，钻研先进的工作方法。为了满足全体工人的愿望，我和一些先进生产者曾到莫斯科各企业参观。从祖国的首都我们带回了很多新的东西来帮助我们进一步提高劳动生产率。例如，在我领导的缝纫车间，我们已把一些手工操作改为用机器，显著地改善了技术操作过程。这减轻了女工们的劳动，使很多人在每班工作时间中提高生产定额到二至三倍。
    有一次，我们的一个女工向我——也就是向一个代表说她没有受过普通教育，她要求说：“帮助我得到知识吧”。于是在行政的帮助下，我们在企业中组织了按照普通教育的教学提纲进行的学习。我们聘请的教员——工程师和技术人员都很愿意帮助男女工人学习，在旧时的资产阶级立陶宛男女工人们是不可能学习的。密切地和人们联系，研究他们的需要，可以帮助我们，苏维埃的代表们，更好地完成自己的任务，及时地提出和解决迫切的问题。我想举这样一个例子：
    去年，共产党和苏联政府制定了关于进一步提高人民福利的措施，并通过关于改进苏维埃贸易工作水平的决议，这就使劳动者代表苏维埃面临一项具体任务：迅速地和胜利地实现党所制定的措施。包括我在内的维尔纽斯市的苏维埃代表、市苏维埃贸易常设委员会的委员们，像往常一样请求自己的选民、人数众多的工人积极分子、职员和知识分子来协助。城市的居民们在积极地讨论了这一问题后，也提出了许多宝贵的建议，对缺点提出了实事求是的批评，并提醒领导人应该怎样更好地组织市内的国营贸易和集体农庄贸易的工作。当然，我们的共同努力并不是徒劳无益的。最近以来，城市里已增设了不少商店、食堂、饭馆和咖啡店，对顾客的服务也有了改进。
    由于代表们的主动性和组织工作，我们这个城市也和立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国其他城市一样，不仅贸易工作有了显著的改善，而且在住宅和文化生活的建设、国民教育和保健事业等方面也有了很大的成就。
    改进地方苏维埃的组织工作，提高苏维埃代表们——人民忠实的勤务员的积极性，将使我们共和国，我们的祖国在国民经济和文化各部门进一步和提高苏联人民的福利方面获得更卓越的成就。
