    The Struggle of Uchinada Village
    Li Ying
    According to the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace" magazine, No. 2, 1954: On the coast of Japan, there is a small village called Uchinada Village. The US military stationed in Japan chose this place to build an artillery test firing base. This incident aroused great anger among the residents of Uchinada Village, and they united to carry out a heroic struggle.

    Wall Street bosses are determined
    To buy Uchinada Village to train artillery.
    They surrounded it with barbed wire,
    And a firing range was built in the middle.
    American generals began to imagine:
    "My cannons are about to do lovely things..."
    Villagers have lived here for generations,
    Fishing at sea and farming in the fields.
    Who wants to plow burning shrapnel?
    Who wants sails filled with the smoke of gunpowder?
    They will never let anyone bomb their homes,
    No one can rob this land!
    On this day, artillery exercises are about to begin,
    And the angry crowd launches a desperate struggle:—
    Fleets of fishing boats sail into the prohibited sea,
    Farmers cut the barbed wire and continue to farm,
    Women bravely lie on the road,
    Forbidding the artillery vehicles to advance, preventing the exercise from succeeding!
    This struggle is not only for a small piece of land,
    But also for the happiness and peace of all mankind.
    The furthest, smallest window on Earth,
    Wherever there are kind people's eyes,
    Will look here and will praise in unison:
    —Little Uchinada Village resists war!

    内滩村的斗争
    李瑛
    据“保卫和平”杂志中文版一九五四年第二号报道：日本海岸上有一个小小的村庄叫内滩村，驻在日本的美国军队选中了这个地方来建筑炮兵试炮基地。这件事引起内滩村居民的极大愤怒，他们团结起来进行了英勇的斗争。
    华尔街老板下定决心，
    要买下内滩村训练炮兵。
    他们在四周围起铁丝网，
    一个射击场就建筑在当中。
    美国将军开始幻想：
    “我的大炮就要做出可爱的事情……”
    村民们世世代代住在这里，
    在海上捕鱼，在田里耕种。
    谁愿意耕犁燃烧着的弹片？
    谁愿意帆里鼓满硝烟的风？
    他们决不让人炸毁自己的家，
    谁要抢劫这块土地，决不可能！
    这一天，炮兵演习就要开始，
    愤怒的人群掀起决死的斗争：——
    成群的渔船驶向禁区的海面，
    农民们割断铁丝网继续耕种，
    妇女们勇敢地躺在大路上，
    不准炮车前进，不让演习成功！
    这场斗争不仅为了一小片土地，
    也为了全人类的幸福与和平。
    地球上最远、最小的一面窗子，
    只要那里有善良人们的眼睛，
    都会向这里眺望，都会齐声赞颂：
    ——小小的内滩村抗拒了战争！
