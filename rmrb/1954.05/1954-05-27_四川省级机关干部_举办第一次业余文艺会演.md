Sichuan Provincial Government Cadres
Hold First Amateur Arts Performance

In early May, cadres from Sichuan Province's first-level government agencies, under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, held their first amateur arts performance. More than 50 units participated in the performance, with 237 programs rehearsed. Seventy-five programs participated in the selection competition. The results of the selection were announced on the 17th, with 31 programs winning awards.

The programs participating in the performance had the characteristics of being short, concise, and diverse. Many programs were also closely integrated with the business work of their respective departments, with as many as seventeen programs being self-written and self-performed. The clapper talk "The General Line Illuminates the Cooking Class," self-written and performed by the cooks of the Sichuan Provincial Party School of the Communist Party of China, the poetry recitation "Almost" created by the Sichuan People's Publishing House, and the solo "Chairman Mao is Here" performed in minority languages by the National Publishing House, were all warmly welcomed by the audience.

This performance greatly promoted the cultural and recreational activities of the government agencies and cultivated many activists in these activities. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Youth League, and other units are preparing to learn from the experience, promote it, and make the cultural and recreational activities of the government agencies regular and more widely popular in the future.

    四川省级机关干部
    举办第一次业余文艺会演
    五月上旬，四川省一级机关的干部在新民主主义青年团四川省委、四川省文联的领导下，举办第一次业余文艺会演。参加会演的有五十多个单位，预演节目二百三十七个。参加评选比赛的节目有七十五个。十七日公布了评选结果，得奖的有三十一个节目。
    参加会演的节目具备了短小精悍、多种多样的特色，很多节目还跟自己部门的业务工作紧密结合，自编自演的节目就有十七个之多。中共四川省委党校的炊事员自编自演的金钱板“总路线照亮了炊事班”，四川人民出版社创作的诗朗诵“差不多”，以及民族出版社用少数民族语言演出的独唱
  “毛主席来了”等节目，都受到了观众热烈的欢迎。
    这次演出，使机关文娱活动大大推进一步，并培养了很多机关文娱活动积极分子。四川省文联、青年团四川省委等单位准备从中吸收经验，加以推广，好使机关文娱活动今后能走向经常化，并具备更广泛的群众性。
