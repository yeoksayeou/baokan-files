Political and Ideological Work of Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative
    Ge Zhiqing

    In the spring of 1952, Chenjiazhuang in Datong, Shanxi Province, began organizing an agricultural producers' cooperative with 32 households and strengthened its leadership over mutual aid teams. The village achieved a bumper harvest that year, with grain output exceeding the pre-war level by 106.6 percent. The living standards of the masses gradually improved, and every household had enough grain. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative expanded to 145 households (out of a total of 147 households in the village). During the autumn harvest distribution, each work day was allocated 11 jin and 12 liang of raw grain, with an average of about 20 dan of grain distributed to each household. The masses gradually escaped poverty and moved towards prosperity. Cooperative members described their happy lives as "every family has surplus grain, and every household wears new clothes." The villagers deeply recognized that only by taking the socialist road could they achieve a happy life.

    The achievements of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative are inseparable from the Party's strong political and ideological leadership. The branch strengthened political and ideological education both within and outside the Party, ensuring the development and consolidation of the cooperative.

    I. The branch regularly conducts education on the two roads for Party members and cooperative members. At the beginning of the cooperative's establishment (spring of 1952), the ideological situation within and outside the Party was quite complex. Some Party members believed that "the revolution has succeeded, and the world is at peace," and planned to "buy houses, buy land, and hire long-term laborers," burying themselves in production and planning to get rich individually. Zhang Cheng-gui was one of them. The muddled thinking among the masses was even more serious. Some people wanted to take advantage of the cooperative's establishment to gain some benefits. Zhang Fu-chun said, "Running an agricultural cooperative is running a big public household!" Some people only cared about individual wealth and were not interested in running the cooperative; even more people adopted a wait-and-see attitude. After the branch understood these ideological situations, it organized a large-scale propaganda and education campaign. The branch first rectified the thinking of all Party members, using Zhang Cheng-gui's thinking as a typical example to launch a struggle against capitalist tendencies, strictly criticizing the erroneous thinking of Party members who only cared about individual wealth. Many Party members liquidated their bourgeois ideas, recognized the danger of only caring about individual wealth, and clarified that they must lead the peasants to "organize" and take the road of collectivization. Party members who had made mistakes also made self-criticisms. For example, Zhang Cheng-gui confessed, "In the past, I was a long-term laborer. Now that I have land, carts, and mules, I want to hire long-term laborers. I am not committed to work and have become a Party member in name only. No wonder the masses look down on me. It turns out that I have not served the masses well." After the Party's ideology was unified, the branch, with Party members and Youth League members as the core, united the activists among the masses and universally conducted education on the road of collectivization and collectivism. In late autumn, the branch invited Zhao Xiao-wu, a representative of peasants who had visited the Soviet Union, to the village to introduce the happy lives of peasants in Soviet collective farms, which greatly encouraged the peasants' confidence in taking the socialist road. Education on the two roads is ongoing. After the hasty and rash deviations were corrected in the spring of 1953, the cooperative was further consolidated. However, because at that time, the emphasis was simply on correcting deviations without linking it to the fundamental road of rural economic development, serious negative emotions arose after the deviations were corrected. This right-leaning thinking was mainly manifested in the leadership of the cooperative. For example, the head of the cooperative, Dai Yu-zhang, said: "If it was 'left', we'll be a little more right." They stopped promoting socialism and relaxed ideological education for cooperative members. The branch immediately convened a meeting of Party members to make everyone re-recognize the positive significance of correcting deviations, and focused on explaining what would happen if things were allowed to drift. This raised the awareness of cadres and cooperative members, and those who had originally planned to withdraw from the cooperative did not do so. The cooperative was consolidated.

    II. The branch pays attention to educating Party members to consolidate the unity of poor and middle peasants. When developing and expanding the cooperative, some Party members and the masses were always unwilling to admit poor households into the cooperative, fearing that they would take advantage of them. In response to this thinking, the branch educated cooperative members to recognize that everyone used to be in difficulties and had collectively turned themselves around. Today, they should unite to move towards common prosperity, and used concrete accounting methods to explain to cooperative members that the cooperative had more people, more strength, more capital, and more methods. At the same time, it could use labor in a unified and planned way, so that even those with weaker labor power would not be idle. Therefore, the entry of poor households into the cooperative would not harm the cooperative. This enlightened the cooperative members' thinking of unity and friendship, solved the problem of admitting poor households into the cooperative, and consolidated the unity of poor and middle peasants. After the poor households joined the cooperative, the cooperative paid attention to organizing their production, and whenever there was work suitable for poor households to do, they were given priority. Last year, the poor households who joined the cooperative each earned more than four dan of grain. As a result, the 21 poor households in Chenjiazhuang, like other peasants, embarked on the road of common prosperity. The branch also conducted education on the glory of labor for poor households. For example, Dai Zeng, because he had no way to make a living for a long time, lost the habit of labor and wandered around all day long. In order to reform him, the branch suggested that the cooperative assign him to the Party member Dai Yu-gui's group. In daily production, Dai Yu-gui often educated him on the glory of labor, encouraging him to actively engage in labor and production and move towards the road of prosperity together with everyone. In this way, he slowly became aware and became the leader of the labor group. However, also because the thinking of the leading cadres of the cooperative was not clear enough, some erroneous methods were once adopted to organize the production of poor households, such as organizing cooperative members to do petty groceries, etc. This practice violated the provision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives that "running commerce cannot be used as a sideline of agricultural producers' cooperatives," and attention has now begun to be paid to correcting it.

    III. Strengthened education on the worker-peasant alliance. When implementing the unified purchase of grain, many peasants revealed many muddled concepts in the issue of the worker-peasant alliance and the relationship between industry and agriculture, complaining that the living standards of workers were too high. After studying these reflections, the branch, in conjunction with the propaganda of the general line, used the method of calculating the accounts of turning over and calculating the accounts of high yield, inspiring the peasants to recall and compare the production and living conditions before and after liberation, so that the peasants could recognize through concrete examples from their own experience that it would not be possible to achieve continuous increase in production without the economic support of the state and the support of the working class. Therefore, they correctly understood the important significance of the worker-peasant alliance and encouraged the peasants' enthusiasm to take the socialist road. The peasants who used to say that the living standards of workers were high now say: "Workers' labor is more valuable than peasants', and the high living standards of workers are a manifestation of good production, which is beneficial and harmless to peasants, and the living standards of peasants are also gradually improving." Everyone expressed that they must actively produce to support the country's industrial construction. Therefore, the cooperative members enthusiastically sold 200,000 jin of surplus grain collectively to the state, and invested 30 million yuan of grain sales revenue in the cooperative, actively expanding reproduction. However, this issue has not been completely resolved among cooperative members. When the interests of the cooperative conflict with the interests of the state, everyone cannot subordinate small interests to large interests. For example, this year the state called for planting more wheat fields, and the cadres of the cooperative believed that: "The people of Chenjiazhuang do not eat wheat, so there is no need to plant wheat." After the cadres' mobilization and persuasion, the wheat fields have been slightly expanded. This also shows that it is necessary to continuously conduct education on the worker-peasant alliance and patriotic education in conjunction with production.

    IV. Overcoming conservative thinking and conducting scientific and technological education. When the cooperative decided to use new-style walking plows, chemical fertilizers, and advanced cultivation techniques, it was opposed by conservative and backward thinking. For example, when promoting close planting, some people said: "Sparse planting yields every year, while dense planting depends on the year." The branch used the yield comparison of sparse and dense planting methods to illustrate the superiority of Soviet advanced cultivation experience, and initially broke everyone's conservative thinking and implemented close planting. When using new-style walking plows, it also compared the advantages and disadvantages of the new and old plows, so that the cooperative members were all convinced, and organized a research group on the use of new walking plows, so that the cooperative members learned the technology of using new plows, and the new agricultural tools were used throughout the cooperative. The cooperative members now also say: "New-style agricultural tools and new technologies are good. Our village has never heard of a mu of land yielding 600 jin."

    V. Raising revolutionary vigilance and struggling against the remnants of feudal forces. After correcting the hasty and rash deviations in the spring of 1953, the branch relaxed its ideological leadership over the peasants, and also showed麻痹in politics, relaxing its vigilance against reactionary forces. After the landlord Zhang Zhen-shan was admitted to the cooperative, he colluded with unscrupulous merchants to carry out sabotage activities, luring some backward masses to withdraw from the cooperative, and even put rubber-tired carts on the cooperative's land to trample on crops. The sabotage activities of the landlord elements and remnants of counter-revolutionaries caused ideological confusion among the masses. Thirteen cooperative members demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, and some cadres even did not dare to struggle against these bad elements. With the help and instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the branch quickly convened a meeting of Party members, starting with examining work and leading ideology, criticizing the right-leaning thinking of some branch members, pointing out the mistakes of relaxing leadership, and raising the vigilance of Party members. Then, the branch convened a mass meeting, exposing the enemy's conspiracy activities. Through this incident, the class consciousness and political vigilance of Party members and the masses were raised. Deputy director Dai Yu-zhang said: "The enemy is so fierce, we must resolutely struggle against him." The masses also expressed one after another: "Resolutely unite around the branch, consolidate the agricultural producers' cooperative, and take the socialist road." Finally, the entire cooperative unanimously passed the expulsion of Zhang Zhen-shan from the cooperative.

    In addition, the branch consciously conducted education on democratic management, cherishing public property, and labor consciousness within the cooperative, changing the labor attitude of cooperative members; conducted education against feudal and backward ideas and implemented equal pay for equal work for men and women, mobilizing women to participate in production; 48 women participated in regular field labor, and women's work days accounted for 15 percent of the total work days of the cooperative.

    In order to effectively carry out political and ideological work, the Chenjiazhuang branch adopted the following methods: (1) Two branch committee members were specifically responsible for grasping the ideological situation within the Party and the cooperative. Three branch committee members were responsible for the branch's education and propaganda network. The branch divided all cooperative members in the cooperative into four major areas according to their residential streets, and each area was led and educated by one branch committee member. Party groups were also organized separately according to the four major areas. The Party groups also divided the responsibility for understanding the ideological situation of the cooperative members in their area and conducting propaganda and education. With such a division of labor in political and ideological work, the Party's various policies, instructions, and decisions can be quickly transmitted and implemented. And the ideological situation, opinions, and requirements of the cooperative members can also be quickly reflected to the branch. The branch regularly studies the ideological situation of Party members and cooperative members, and then determines the solution to the problem. For example, Deputy Director Dai Yu-zhang (member of the branch committee) was once complacent and arrogant, and his work style was undemocratic, and the cooperative members had many opinions. After studying this situation, the branch first cleared Dai Yu-zhang's thinking, and let him make a self-criticism to all cooperative members at the meeting. After the meeting, it urged him to correct his mistakes. This consolidated the unity within the cooperative and increased the Party's prestige. (2) The cooperative holds members' representative meetings on a regular basis to enable members to participate in the management of the cooperative and supervise the cooperative. Through this concentrated occasion, the branch listens to the opinions and reflections of the members, publicizes the Party's policies, and conducts political and ideological education. (3) In propaganda activities, the Party branch not only regularly promotes Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists to carry out propaganda, but also pays great attention to using the activists that have emerged in the cooperative, and organizes them to carry out propaganda based on their own experiences. (4) In addition to regularly giving Party members, Youth League members, and cooperative members political classes and organizing group studies, the branch also regularly educates cooperative members through various forms of cultural propaganda activities. For example, organizing cooperative members to read newspapers; establishing people's schools and literacy classes; establishing reading rooms. The branch also organized village drama troupes and established blackboards and rooftop broadcasts. The widespread development of propaganda and education work has played a great role in improving the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members.

    陈家庄农业生产合作社的政治思想工作
    葛植青
    山西省大同陈家庄一九五二年春天开始组织了一个三十二户的农业生产合作社，并加强了对互助组的领导，这年全村得到了丰收，粮食产量超过了战前的百分之一百零六点六，群众生活水平逐渐提高，家家粮食自足。秋收后，社扩大到一百四十五户（全村共一百四十七户），秋收分配时，每个劳动日分到十一斤十二两原粮，平均每户分到二十石左右的粮食。群众逐渐摆脱了贫困，走向富裕。社员们形容他们的愉快生活说：“家家有余粮，户户穿新衣。”全村农民深刻地认识到只有走社会主义道路，才能得到幸福的生活。
    陈家庄农业生产合作社获得这些成绩，是和党的坚强的政治思想领导分不开的。支部抓紧了党内外的政治思想教育，保证了社的发展和巩固。
    一、支部经常对党员、社员进行两条道路的教育。建社之初（一九五二年春天）党内外思想情况是相当复杂的。一部分党员认为“革命胜利了，天下太平了”，盘算着“买房、买地、雇长工”，埋头生产，打算个人发财，张成贵就是其中的一个。群众中的糊涂思想则更为严重。有些人想趁建社机会沾点便宜，张富春说：“闹农业社是闹大公家呢！”有些群众只顾个人发家致富，对办社不感兴趣；抱观望态度的则更多。支部了解了这些思想情况，就组织了一次规模较大的宣传教育工作。支部首先整顿全体党员思想，以张成贵思想为典型开展了反对资本主义思想倾向的斗争，严格批判了党员中只顾个人发财的错误思想。许多党员清算了自己的资产阶级思想，认识了只顾个人发财的危险性，明确了必须带领农民“组织起来”走合作化的道路。犯了错误的党员，也都进行了检讨。如张成贵检讨说：“过去当长工，现在有了土地、大车、骡马，就想雇长工，无心工作，成了个挂名党员，怪不得群众看不起我，原来是我没有好好为群众服务。”党内思想一致后，支部以党员、团员为核心，团结群众中的积极分子，普遍地向群众进行了合作化道路和集体主义的教育。秋末，支部邀请了访苏农民代表赵孝武同志到村里介绍了苏联集体农庄农民的幸福生活，这对农民走社会主义道路的信心给了莫大的鼓舞。两条道路的教育是经常的。一九五三年春纠正了急躁冒进偏向以后，社进一步巩固了。但是因为当时单纯强调了纠正偏向，没有和农村经济发展的根本道路联系起来进行教育，因而在纠正偏向之后，产生了严重的消极情绪。这种右倾思想主要表现在社的领导上。如社长戴玉章说：
  “‘左’了，咱再右一点。”他们就不宣传社会主义了，放松了对社员的思想教育。支部当即召开了党员大会，让大家重新认识纠正偏向的积极意义，并着重说明放任自流下去会得什么结果。这就提高了干部、社员的觉悟，原来打算出社的也不出社了。社就得到了巩固。
    二、支部注意教育党员巩固贫农和中农的团结。当发展、扩大社时，一部分党员和群众总不愿意吸收贫困户入社，怕他们沾了自己的光。支部针对这种思想，教育社员认识大家过去都是困难户，共同团结翻了身，今天要团结起来共同走向富裕，并且用具体算账的办法向社员说明社人多、力量大、本钱厚、办法多，同时有计划地统一使用劳动力，劳动力弱的也闲不下来，因此，困难户入社，对社并无害处。这样就启发了社员团结友爱的思想，解决了吸收贫困户入社的问题，巩固了贫农和中农的团结。贫困户入社后，社里注意组织他们生产，凡是适宜于困难户作的活，就尽先让他们去干。去年，入社的困难户每人收入四石多粮食。这样作的结果，陈家庄二十一户困难户，跟其他农民一样，一同走上了共同富裕的道路。支部对贫困户也进行了劳动光荣等教育。如戴增，因为长期无生产门路，失去了劳动习惯，整天东走西串。支部为了改造他，就建议社把他分配到党员戴玉贵小组。在日常生产中，戴玉贵经常对他进行劳动光荣等教育，鼓励他积极劳动生产，和大家一齐走向富裕的道路。这样他慢慢觉悟了，成为劳动小组长。但是，也由于社的领导干部思想还不够明确，曾经采取了一些错误的办法组织贫困户的生产，如组织社员作小杂货铺买卖等，这种作法违背了中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中“经营商业不能够作为农业生产合作社的副业”的规定，现已开始注意纠正。
    三、加强了工农联盟的教育。在实行粮食统购时，不少农民在工农联盟、工业与农业的关系问题上，暴露出许多糊涂观念，埋怨工人生活水平太高。支部研究了这些反映，就结合宣传总路线，用算翻身账、算丰产账的办法，启发农民回忆对比了解放前后的生产、生活情况，使农民通过亲身经历的具体事例，认识到没有国家的经济扶助，没有工人阶级的支援是不可能达到连年增产的。因而正确地理解了工农联盟的重要意义，鼓舞了农民走社会主义道路的劲头。原来说工人生活水平高的农民现在都说：
  “工人劳动价值比农民多，工人生活水平高是生产好的表现，这对农民有利无害，而且农民的生活水平也在逐步提高了。”大家都表示一定要积极生产支援国家工业建设。因此，社员们踊跃地集体出售余粮二十万斤给国家，卖粮款三千万元投资到社内，积极扩大再生产。但是，这个问题在社员中并没有完全解决，当社的利益与国家利益发生矛盾时，大家还不能把小利益服从大利益。如今年国家号召多种麦田，社里的干部认为：“陈家庄群众不吃麦子，就用不着种麦子。”经干部动员说服，麦田已略有扩大。这也说明了必须结合生产不断地进行工农联盟的教育与爱国主义的教育。
    四、克服保守思想，进行科学技术的教育。社内决定使用新式步犁、化学肥料和先进耕作技术的时候，都遭到了保守落后思想的反对。如推广密植时，有人就说：“稀了年年收，稠了碰年头”。支部就用稀密两种种植方法的产量对比说明苏联先进耕作经验的优越性，初步打破了大家的保守思想，实行了密植。使用新式步犁时，也同时用新旧两种犁的好坏作比较，使社员们都心服口服，并组织了使用新步犁的研究小组，使社员们都学会使用新犁的技术，新农具才在全社使用起来。社员们现在也说：“新式农具、新的技术就是好，咱村历来也没听说过一亩地能打六百斤。”
    五、提高革命警惕，向残余的封建势力作斗争。一九五三年春季纠正冒进偏向后，支部放松了对农民的思想领导，而且在政治上也表现了麻痹，放松了对反动势力的警惕。地主张振山被吸收进社后，勾结奸商进行破坏活动，拉拢一些落后群众退社，还套上胶皮大车在社的土地上践踏庄稼。地主分子和反革命残余势力的破坏活动，造成了群众的思想混乱，十三户社员要求退社，有的干部甚至不敢向这些坏分子进行斗争。支部在上级党委的帮助与指示下迅速召开党员大会，先从检查工作和领导思想入手，批评了某些支部委员的右倾思想，指出了放松领导的错误，提高了党员的警惕性。接着，支部又召开群众会议，揭露了敌人的阴谋活动。通过这一事件，提高了党员和群众中的阶级觉悟和政治警惕性。副社长戴玉章说：“敌人这样凶恶，必须和他坚决斗争。”群众也纷纷表示：“坚决团结在支部周围，巩固农业生产合作社，走社会主义道路。”最后全社一致通过把张振山开除出社。
    此外，支部还有意识地在社内进行关于民主管理、爱护公共财物、劳动自觉的教育，转变了社员的劳动态度；进行了反对封建落后思想，贯彻男女同工同酬的教育，发动妇女参加生产；四十八个妇女参加了经常的田间劳动，妇女劳动日占到全社总劳动日的百分之十五。
    陈家庄支部为了切实做好政治思想工作，采取了以下几种办法：（一）以支部委员二人，专门负责掌握党内、社内的思想情况。以支部委员三人负责支部教育和宣传网。支部把全社社员按居住的街道，分为四大片，每一片由一支部委员负责领导教育。党的小组，也按四大片分别编组。党小组并分工负责了解本片社员的思想情况和进行宣传教育，社内的各生产组织（生产组、生产队等），均分配强有力的党员、团员，去充当骨干和负责进行政治思想工作。在政治思想工作上有了这样的分工，党的各项政策和指示、决定，就能够迅速地传达贯彻下去。而社员们的思想情况、意见、要求等，也能很快地反映到支部来。支部定期研究党员、社员的思想情况，从而确定解决问题的办法。如副社长戴玉章（支委），曾一度居功自傲，作风不民主，社员们意见很多。支部研究这一情况后，首先打通了戴玉章的思想，并让他在大会上向全体社员进行检讨，会后，督促他改正了错误。从而巩固了社内的团结，提高了党的威信。（二）社按期举行社员代表会，以便社员参与社的管理工作和对社进行监督。支部通过这一集中的场合，听取社员们的意见和反映，宣传党的政策和进行政治思想教育。（三）党支部在宣传活动上，不仅经常推动党员、团员和宣传员进行宣传，还十分注意使用社内涌现出来的积极分子，组织他们进行现身说法的宣传。（四）支部除定期地给党员、团员、社员们分别上政治课和组织小组学习外，还经常通过各种形式的文化宣传活动教育社员。如组织社员读报；建立民校和扫盲班；建立书报阅览室。支部还组织了村剧团、建立了黑板报、屋顶广播等。宣传教育工作的广泛开展，对于社员们政治觉悟和劳动热情的提高起了很大作用。
