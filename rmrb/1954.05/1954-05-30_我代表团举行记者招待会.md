Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 28th. The spokesman for the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Geneva Conference, Huang Hua, held a press conference after the meeting on the 28th.

Huang Hua briefed reporters on the situation of the meeting on the 28th and commented on the speech made by U.S. Under Secretary of State Smith at the meeting on the 28th. Huang Hua pointed out that Smith's speech, apart from supporting and demanding that the conference accept the Byun Yung-tae proposal, which attempts to impose the Syngman Rhee regime on the entire Korean people, contained no constructive content. Therefore, it is impossible to see that the United States has the sincerity to resolve the Korean issue through consultation.

In response to questions raised by reporters, Huang Hua said, in answer to a question posed by a reporter: It is rumored that the US delegation is preparing to meet with the Chinese delegation on the issue of several Americans who have violated Chinese law and are being detained by the Chinese government. What are the next steps in this matter? Huang Hua replied: A few days ago, the U.S. delegation, through the British delegation, expressed its willingness to contact the Chinese delegation on the issue of a large number of innocent Chinese nationals and students detained in the United States, as well as a small number of Americans detained for violating Chinese law. So far, personnel from the two delegations have not met. Huang Hua reiterated his statement at the press conference on May 26, saying that if the U.S. government is interested in discussing such issues, the Chinese side never refuses to negotiate.

    我代表团举行记者招待会
     【新华社日内瓦二十八日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人黄华在二十八日会后举行记者招待会。
    黄华向记者们介绍了二十八日会议的情况，并评论了美国副国务卿史密斯在二十八日会议上的发言。黄华指出，史密斯除了支持并要求会议接受企图以李承晚政权强加于全体朝鲜人民身上的卞荣泰建议以外，毫无建设性的内容。因此看不出美国有以协商解决朝鲜问题的诚意。
    在黄华回答记者们提出的问题时，有一个记者问道：传说美国代表团方面准备就若干被中国政府拘禁的违法美国人问题与中国代表团方面会晤，此事下一步骤如何？黄华答称：几天以前，美国代表团方面曾通过英国代表团方面，表示愿就大量无辜被扣在美国的中国侨民和学生以及少数因违反中国法律而被拘禁的美国人的问题与中国代表团接触。迄今两国代表团人员尚未会晤。黄华重申他在五月二十六日记者招待会上的发言说，如果美国政府有意商谈这类问题，中国方面从不拒绝进行商谈。
