    【This newspaper Zhengzhou, 3rd dispatch】The state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which started construction last "May Day," has begun production this "May Day."
    After this textile factory goes into operation, the cloth produced by the end of the year will be equivalent to more than 160% of the total cloth production of the entire province last year. Due to the factory's excellent modern machinery and equipment, and high-quality raw materials supplied locally, trial production results show that not only does the quality of the yarn reach first-class, and the cotton cloth fully meets standards, but the cost is also relatively low.
    Henan Province is one of China's major cotton-producing areas, with an annual cotton production of about 300 million jin. The cotton lint length, tensile strength, and color of northern Henan cotton are the best in the country. Zhengzhou is also located at the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai railways, making the supply of raw materials and the output of products very convenient. At the same time, the climate of Henan Province is also very suitable for the temperature and humidity required by the textile industry.
    The machinery and building materials of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are all manufactured by factories across the country. During the installation project, workers put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals, improved more than 20 kinds of tools, and a large number of model figures emerged. Many groups also overfulfilled their tasks every month. In the past year, 46% of the skilled workers on this construction site were upgraded, and 71% of the apprentices became skilled workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 3rd dispatch: The newly built state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has been completed and put into production two months ahead of schedule.
    This textile factory started construction on April 30, 1953, and was fully completed by the end of April this year, taking only one year. The fact that this textile factory was put into production two months ahead of schedule can create more than 60 billion yuan of wealth for the country.
    Before being formally put into production, this textile factory underwent more than 40 days of rigorous test run technical inspections. The results proved that the quality and production efficiency of the complete set of domestically produced machines equipped in this textile factory are very good.
    According to the national plan, this textile factory, calculated on a three-shift basis, can produce about 1.3 million pieces of cloth throughout the year, which can supply more than 7.5 million people with a new set of clothes each. This textile factory can also accumulate funds for the country to build a textile factory of the same scale every three years.

    郑州和石家庄新建的棉纺织厂投入生产
    【本报郑州三日电】去年“五一”动工兴建的国营郑州第一棉纺织厂，今年“五一”已开工生产。
    这个纺织厂开工后，到年底所生产的布匹，将等于全省去年织布总产量的百分之一百六十以上。由于这个厂有优良的现代化机械设备和就地供应的品质优良的原料，试车生产的结果，不仅纱的质量达到甲等，棉布完全符合标准，而且成本也较低。
    河南省是我国主要产棉区之一，年产棉花约三万万斤，豫北棉花的棉绒长度、耐拉力和色泽都是全国最好的；郑州又处于京汉、陇海两条铁路的交叉点，原料的供应和产品的输出都很方便；同时，河南省的气候也很适合纺织工业所需要的温湿度。
    国营郑州第一棉纺织厂的机械和建筑器材，全是我国各地工厂自己制造的。在安装工程中，工人们曾提出了二百多条合理化建议，改进了二十多种工具，涌现出大批模范人物。许多小组还月月超额完成了任务。过去一年中这个工地上就有百分之四十六的技术工人升了级，百分之七十一的学工升成了技术工人。
    据新华社保定三日讯：新建国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂，已比原计划提前两月建成投入生产。
    这座纺织厂在一九五三年四月三十日开始动工，到今年四月底全部建成，仅仅用了一年的时间。这个纺织厂提前两个月投入生产，可以给国家多创造价值六百多亿元的财富。
    这个纺织厂在正式投入生产以前，曾经过四十多天严格的试车技术检验。结果证明这个纺织厂所装备的全套国产机器的质量和生产效能都很好。
    这个纺织厂根据国家计划，如以三班计算，全年能生产约一百三十多万匹布，可以供给七百五十多万人每人各作一套新衣服。这个纺织厂还能每隔三年给国家积累建设一座同样规模的纺织厂的资金。
