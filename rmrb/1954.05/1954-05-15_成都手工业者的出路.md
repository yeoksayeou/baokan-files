The Way Out for Chengdu Handicraft Workers
By Our Reporter Liu Heng

Chengdu is a nationally renowned city of handicrafts. The streets are lined with handicraft shops. The leather industry is concentrated on Pifang Street, the woodworking industry on Luoguo Lane, and almost every major industry has its own concentration.

Handicrafts account for a large proportion of Chengdu's local economy. The city has 14,800 handicraft households, accounting for 98% of the city's industrial households; 40,100 employees, accounting for 74% of the city's total industrial workforce; and an annual output value of more than 400 billion yuan, accounting for 41% of the city's total industrial output value. There are 96 handicraft industries, producing building materials such as bricks and tiles, military supplies such as horse gear and military pots, iron and wooden farm tools, industrial raw materials, various furniture items, cultural and daily necessities, and exquisite handicrafts, totaling more than 9,500 varieties. The leather shoes manufactured by Chengdu's handicraft workers are sold far and wide to major cities in Northeast, North, and Northwest China; their violins are also well-known; and the workers constructing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Kangding-Tibet Highway are using the tools they manufacture to open mountains and pave roads.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, Chengdu's handicrafts have made considerable progress. The industries that have developed the fastest include iron and woodworking, which serve production and construction, and clothing and musical instruments, which serve the material and cultural needs of the people. Handicrafts have already established close ties with the state-owned economy. The amount of processing orders placed by the state-owned economy is increasing year by year, reaching more than 161.6 billion yuan in 1953, an increase of 42.5% over 1952. In this way, handicrafts are gradually adapting to the needs of the state plan and becoming a capable assistant to the state-owned economy in organizing sources of goods and regulating the market. There are eleven handicraft production cooperatives in the city, with 750 members; nine production teams, with 120 members. In addition, there are more than 80 spontaneously organized production teams, with more than 4,800 members.

Like handicrafts elsewhere, Chengdu's handicrafts are characterized by a shortage of capital, crude tools, low labor efficiency, and the need to buy raw materials expensively and sell finished products cheaply, enduring the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. On average, each handicraft laborer's household has less than three production personnel. According to a survey of 1,026 households in the ironworking and leather industries, their average capital is only 500,000 yuan, which is only enough capital for five pairs of leather shoes. With little capital, they cannot buy raw materials in bulk, and buying in small quantities is more expensive. Once the products are made, they have to rush to find a market. If they cannot sell them in three or five days, they will not have raw materials to work with, and they will not have rice to cook. They have to rush to buy raw materials and find buyers. Running around buying and selling, they cannot work for six or seven days a month. The rest of the time, they rush during the day and work late into the night, working twelve or thirteen hours a day, and the money they earn sometimes is not enough to make ends meet. They are busy making a living all year round, let alone improving their techniques and tools.

The most painful thing for handicraft laborers is to endure the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. Except for a small number of people who have their own shops for self-production and self-sale, most people have to rely on merchants to buy their goods. Even these small number of people, because they are located in back streets and alleys, do not have complete goods, new colors, and cannot compete with commercial firms. In the off-season, they also have to sell some of their products to private merchants. They are afraid of selling their goods to the "bottom hall." This "bottom hall" is where private merchants bargain to buy their products. For example, there is a "Yuanda Tea House" on Pifang Street, which is the "bottom hall" for the leather shoe industry. The merchant buying the goods sits there with his legs crossed and a dark face, pretending not to see you when you walk up to him with your leather shoes. You have to call out "Boss" several times before he opens his eyelids and gives you a cold look. He takes the leather shoes in his hand, looks at them left and right, and when he has found enough faults, he gives you a price. If it is worth 100,000 yuan, he will give you at most 70,000 yuan, and says that he did not want to buy it, but this is to take care of you.

Some people are unwilling to sell their goods to the "bottom hall," so they establish a production and sales relationship with large workshops or stores, and "deliver goods," so that their products have a fixed market. In this way, 25% of the profits are earned by commercial capitalists. Large workshops and stores often use the excuse of sales difficulties to pay the suppliers in installments, 100,000 today, 80,000 tomorrow, so that you cannot run away, cannot escape, cannot die, and cannot live well. Some commercial firms also lend some money to small households to buy raw materials, which is equivalent to tying a rope around them and letting them manipulate them.

Some people put their products in the windows of large commercial firms for "consignment sales," and the large commercial firms take 20% of the selling price as a handling fee. The goods for "consignment sales" must be of colors and sizes that the large commercial firms do not have, so as not to steal the business of the large commercial firms. You only get the money when the goods are sold. If the goods are old or damaged, the loss is the owner's. Many people are in a hurry to use money, so they have to go to the "bottom hall."

How can we relieve the suffering of Chengdu's handicraft laborers? The only way is to take the road of cooperation. The city's eleven production cooperatives have already set an example for everyone. Take the Chengdu Cloth Shoe Production Cooperative as an example. After it was established at the end of 1951, with concentrated funds, it could buy raw materials in large quantities; collective labor could rationally divide labor and improve work efficiency; and the products made were of good quality, low cost, and easy to sell. Once organized, they are not subject to the intermediate exploitation of merchants, and it is also easy to undertake processing orders from state-owned commercial departments. In just over two years, the cooperative's funds have increased from the initial 1.1 million yuan to 270 million yuan; the number of public tools has increased from two pairs of lasts to more than 100 pairs; in addition, six sewing machines and two electric sanding machines have been purchased. The cooperative has also built new workshops with basketball courts, radios, and medical, library and other facilities, which looks like a small factory. The lives of the members have naturally been significantly improved. For example, Li Shangkang was once evicted by his landlord and forced to hang himself, and two of his three children were dragged to death. After joining the cooperative in 1952, the situation changed dramatically. In the past, he worked in a small room, worrying about funds, raw materials, sales, and life, worrying about everything he saw. Now, he and everyone else are happily engaged in production in a bright workshop, and there is nothing to worry about anymore. In the past, he worked alone in silence, and he was exhausted after sewing two shoe soles a day. Now, he sews five a day, and he still has time to talk and laugh. In the past, his family wore clothes with patches on top of patches, and covered themselves with a pile of dirty, black rotten cotton wadding. Now, the whole family has changed into new clothes and flowered quilts, and even his son is going to school.

However, guiding the individual handicraft laborers who have been scattered for many years to the road of cooperatives is still an arduous and complex process. The Chengdu Federation of Cooperatives has decided to conscientiously implement the Party Central Committee's instructions of "actively leading, steadily advancing," training cadres, conducting general line education for handicraft laborers, starting with carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, doing a good job in processing and production, and supporting national economic construction, implementing the principle of voluntariness, and planning to establish nine new cooperatives and organize 42 new production teams this year.

    成都手工业者的出路
    本报记者　刘衡
    成都是全国有名的手工业城市。一条条街道上满是手工业的铺子，制革业集中在皮房街，木器业集中在锣锅巷，差不多每个较大的行业，都有自己集中的地方。
    成都市的手工业在地方经济中占的比重很大。全市手工业有一万四千八百多户，占全市工业户的百分之九十八；从业人员有四万零一百多人，占全市工业总人数百分之七十四；全年生产总值四千多亿元，占全市工业总产值百分之四十一。手工业有九十六个行业，产品有砖、瓦等建筑器材，马具、军锅等军用品，铁、木农具，工业原料，各种家具，文化、生活用品以及精巧的手工艺品等，总共有九千五百多种。成都市手工业者制造的皮鞋，远销到东北、华北以及西北各大城市；他们制造的提琴，也很有名；修筑宝成铁路和康藏公路的工人，正在用着他们制造的工具开山、铺路。
    解放以来，在党和人民政府领导下，成都市的手工业有了不小的发展。其中发展得最快的有服务于生产建设的铁作、木作等行业，有服务于人民物质和文化生活需要的衣着、乐器等行业。手工业跟国营经济已经有了密切的联系。国营经济的加工订货投放额一年比一年增加，像一九五三年就有一千六百一十六亿多元，比一九五二年增加百分之四十二点五。这样，手工业开始一步一步适应国家计划的需要，成为国营经济组织货源、调剂市场的得力助手。全市组织起来的手工业生产合作社有十一个，社员七百五十人；生产小组九个，组员一百二十人。另外，还有自发组织起来的生产小组八十多个，组员四千八百多人。
    成都市手工业和别的地方的手工业一样，都有着资金少，工具简陋，劳动效率低，还要贵买原料，贱卖成品，忍受私商的中间剥削等特点。全市手工业劳动者，平均每户的生产人员，还不到三个人。他们的资金，据铁作、皮革业等一千零二十六户的调查，平均每户只有五十万元，只够五双皮鞋的本钱。本钱少，就不能成批买原料，零碎买就要贵些。产品做出来，又得赶快找销路。放下三、五天卖不脱，手下就没原料做活了，吃饭也没米下锅了。既要忙着买原料，又要忙着找买主，跑买跑卖，一个月就有六、七天做不成活。其余的时间，就白天赶，黑夜熬，一天工作十二、三小时，赚的钱有时还餬不住嘴。他们一年四季在忙生活，更谈不上去改良技术和工具了。
    手工业劳动者最痛苦的一件事就是要忍受私商的中间剥削。他们除了小部分人有个自产自销的铺面外，大部分人要依靠商人来买货。就是这小部分人，因多处在背街小巷，货不齐全，花色不新，竞争不过商号，一到淡季，也要把部分产品卖给私商。他们怕把货卖到“底堂”。这“底堂”就是私商杀价收买他们产品的地方。像皮房街有家“远大茶馆”，就是皮鞋业的“底堂”。那买货的商人坐在那里，腿翘起，脸黑起，你拿着皮鞋走到他跟前，他还装着没看见。你连喊几声“老板”，他才翻起眼皮，冷冷看你一眼。他把皮鞋接到手里，左看，右看，等他把毛病挑够了，才说出个价钱。该值十万，顶多给你七万，还说他本不想买，这是为了照顾你。
    有的人不愿意把货卖到“底堂”，就和大作坊或商店建立产销关系，做“送货”，使产品有个固定销路。这样，百分之二十五的利润被商业资本家赚去。大作坊、商店往往借口销售困难，对货主零星付款，今天十万，明天八万，使你跑不了，逃不脱，死不了，也活不好。也有的商号，先拿些钱贷给小户买原料，这就等于把根绳子拴在他身上，任其摆弄了。
    有的人把产品放在大商号的橱窗内做“寄卖”，由大商号抽取百分之二十的卖价作手续费。这“寄卖”的货，要挑大商号没有的花色、尺码，以免抢去了大商号的生意。卖了货，才拿得到钱。货放旧了，放坏了，损失就是货主的。许多人急着用钱，就只好上“底堂”了。
    怎样解除成都市手工业劳动者的痛苦呢？唯一的办法就是走合作化的道路。全市十一个生产合作社已经给大家做出了一个榜样。拿成都市布鞋生产合作社来说吧，它在一九五一年底成立后，资金集中，就可以大批买原料了；集体劳动，可以合理的分工，提高工作效率；做出的东西，质量好，成本低，销路就好办了。组织起来了，不受商人中间剥削，还容易承揽国营商业部门的加工货。不过两年多工夫，社里的资金已由最初的一百一十万元增加到二亿七千万元；公有工具由两对楦头增加到一百多对，另外，还添买了六部缝纫机、两部电力砂边机。合作社还盖了新场房，有篮球场、收音机和医药、图书等设备，看来像个小工厂了。社员们的生活自然也跟着都有了显著的改善。如李尚康曾经被房东赶出过，被逼得上过吊，三个娃娃被拖死了两个。一九五二年入社后，情形就大变了。以前他在小屋里干活，愁资金，愁原料，愁销路，愁生活，望到什么愁什么。现在，他跟大伙儿在亮堂堂的工房里，欢欢喜喜地搞生产，再没什么要发愁了。以前，他一个人闷声闷气地干活，一天纳两只鞋底，就累的不行，现在一天纳五只，还有说有笑。以前，他一家人穿的衣服是补钉上面加补钉，盖的是一堆污黑的烂棉絮，现在全家换上新衣、花被子，连儿子也上学了。
    可是，要把多年分散的个体手工业劳动者引导到合作社的道路，还是一个艰苦、复杂的过程。合作社成都市联社已经决定认真贯彻党中央指示的“积极领导，稳步前进”方针，训练干部，向手工业劳动者进行总路线教育，从开展增产节约运动，搞好加工生产，支援国家经济建设入手，贯彻自愿原则，计划在今年建立新社九个，组织新的生产小组四十二个。
