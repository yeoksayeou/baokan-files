Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 7th: Huang Hua, spokesperson for the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Geneva Conference, held a press conference after the meeting on the 7th.

Huang Hua briefed reporters on the situation of the meeting on the 7th. Subsequently, Huang Hua introduced to the reporters the statement of Sam Sary, Chairman of the Khmer Resistance Government, on May 3rd, and the statement of Prince Souphanouvong, Prime Minister of the Lao Resistance Government, on May 5th. In their respective statements, Chairman Sam Sary and Prime Minister Souphanouvong proposed that in order to ensure that the Geneva Conference can achieve the goal of peacefully resolving the Indochina issue, the Khmer Resistance Government and the Lao Resistance Government should send representatives to participate in the Geneva Conference.

Huang Hua continued: The Indochina issue is about to be discussed. According to the initial agreement, the discussion on the Indochina issue will initially be attended by nine countries. These are: China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the three member states of the French Union in Indochina. Huang Hua added: We believe that since the Indochina issue is to be resolved through consultations between the warring parties in Indochina, the Khmer Resistance Government and the Lao Resistance Government have the right to send their representatives to participate in the Geneva Conference. Therefore, the demands put forward by the Khmer Resistance Government and the Lao Resistance Government in this regard are reasonable and should be given attention.

Huang Hua then refuted a piece of news spread by some Western newspapers based on sources from the French side. This news said that the French side's request to evacuate the wounded from Dien Bien Phu had been rejected by the Chinese delegation. Huang Hua cited facts to point out that this was a completely untrue and deliberately distorted report.

    我国代表团发言人向记者发表谈话
    支持高棉和寮国抗战政府的声明
    指出两国有权利派遣代表参加日内瓦会议
    【新华社日内瓦七日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人黄华在七日会后举行记者招待会。
    黄华向记者们介绍了七日会议的情况。接着，黄华向记者们介绍了高棉抗战政府山玉明主席五月三日的声明和寮国抗战政府苏发努冯总理五月五日的声明。山玉明主席和苏发努冯总理在各自的声明中提出，为了保证日内瓦会议能达到和平解决印度支那问题的目的，高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府应该派遣代表参加日内瓦会议。
    黄华接着说：印度支那问题即将开始讨论。按照初步的协议，关于印度支那问题的讨论，开始将由九个国家参加。这就是：中国、苏联、英国、法国、美国、越南民主共和国和法兰西联邦的印度支那三个成员国。黄华又说：我们认为，既然印度支那问题要由印度支那交战双方各国进行协商谋求解决，那么高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府就有权利派遣自己的代表参加日内瓦会议。因此，高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府关于此事所提出的要求是合理的，是应该受到人们的重视的。
    黄华接着驳斥了某些西方报纸根据法国方面的消息来源所散布的一项消息。这项消息说，法国方面关于从奠边府撤退伤兵的请求已遭到中国代表团的拒绝。黄华列举事实指出：这是完全不符合事实并且故意歪曲的报道。
