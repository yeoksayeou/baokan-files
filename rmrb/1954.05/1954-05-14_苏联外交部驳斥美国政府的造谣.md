The US government's claim in the aforementioned note that American prisoners of war who participated in the Korean War have supposedly been sent to the Soviet Union and are currently under Soviet guard is completely unfounded and is clearly fabricated, as no such personnel have ever existed in the Soviet Union."

    苏联外交部驳斥美国政府的造谣
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联外交部于一九五四年五月五日接到美国大使馆的照会一件，照会说，美国政府据说已经获得情报：曾参加朝鲜战争的美国战俘已被送到苏联。
    五月十二日，苏联外交部把下面的复照交给美国大使馆。
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部谨就一九五四年五月五日收到的美利坚合众国大使馆交来的第九百四十七号照会答复如下：
    美国政府在上述照会里所谓曾参加朝鲜战争的美国战俘据说已被送到苏联、目前正受苏联看管的说法是没有任何根据的，这显然是捏造的，因为在苏联从来没有过这种人员。”
