Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 8th: According to TASS, the World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a letter to all European trade union organizations and working people regarding the upcoming All-European Trade Union Conference to be held in Berlin from June 20th to 22nd.

The statement said: In order to promote the realization of European peace and security and the unity of the working people in this struggle, the World Federation of Trade Unions invites all trade union organizations and all workers in Europe, whether or not they are members of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to send representatives to the All-European Trade Union Conference to be held in Berlin from June 20th to June 22nd. The conference will discuss the following important issues: "The role and tasks of trade unions in the struggle to establish peaceful relations between European countries, to obtain real guarantees of security, and to improve the living standards of the working people."

The World Federation of Trade Unions is willing to consider any suggestions from trade union organizations participating in the conference for inclusion on the agenda.

The statement said, the "European Defense Community" is completely contrary to European security and the interests of the working people. It will make it impossible for trade unions to contact each other and for workers to exchange experiences. It will hinder trade relations between European countries. This will provoke a frenzied attack by monopoly capital on the trade union rights and social interests of workers, causing wage cuts, deterioration of living conditions and poverty, and an increase in the number of unemployed. At the same time, the "European Defense Community" is also an obstacle to the unity of the international working class.

The statement said: The working people of Europe, despite the differences in the economic and social systems of their countries, have common concerns. They are concerned about the reduction of war budgets, they are concerned about expanding trade and cultural exchanges to promote the easing of tensions, the improvement of living standards and working conditions of the working people, and they are concerned about the spirit of consultation prevailing over the policy of strength. For these common concerns, all trade union organizations and all workers must unite and take concerted action.

The statement concludes by saying that the World Federation of Trade Unions asks you to accept the invitation and reiterates its unwavering determination: to do everything possible to fight for the defense of peace, the improvement of living standards, and the strengthening of international friendship.

    就即将在柏林举行的全欧工会会议
    世界工联发表告欧洲各工会和劳动人民书
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社维也纳八日讯：世界工会联合会就将于六月二十日至二十二日在柏林举行的全欧工会会议发表告欧洲各工会组织与所有劳动人民书。
    文告说：为促进欧洲和平与安全的实现以及劳动人民在这个斗争中的团结，世界工会联合会邀请所有工会组织与欧洲所有工人，不论是否参加了世界工联，都派遣代表参加将于六月二十日到六月二十二日在柏林举行的全欧工会会议。在会议上将讨论下面的重要问题：“工会在争取欧洲各国之间建立和平关系、争取安全的真正保证与争取劳动人民生活水平提高的斗争中的作用与任务。”
    世界工联愿意考虑参加会议的工会组织提出的要求列入议程的任何建议。
    文告说，“欧洲防务集团”是与欧洲安全以及劳动人民的利益完全背道而驰的。它将使工会与工会之间，工人与工人之间无法发生联系并交流经验。它将阻挠欧洲各国之间的贸易关系。这将引起垄断资本对工人的工会权利与社会利益的疯狂进攻，引起他们工资的削减，生活条件的恶化以及贫困，引起失业人数的增加。同时，“欧洲防务集团”也是国际工人阶级团结的障碍。
    文告说：欧洲的劳动人民，尽管他们国家的经济与社会制度有所不同，但是有共同的关怀。他们关心着战争预算的削减，他们关心着扩大贸易与文化交流，借以促进紧张局势的缓和，劳动人民的生活水平与劳动条件的改善，他们关心着协商精神战胜实力政策。为了这些共同的关怀，一切工会组织与所有工人必须团结起来采取一致行动。
    文告最后说，世界工联要求你们接受邀请，它重申它的不可动摇的决心：要尽一切力量，为保卫和平、提高生活水平与加强国际友谊而斗争。
