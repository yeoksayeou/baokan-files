    People's Mediation Work Actively Carried Out in Central and South China. According to incomplete statistics from 419 counties and cities in the region, there are already 8,751 People's Mediation Committees. In Huangpi County, Hubei Province, Gaoan County, Jiangxi Province, and other counties, more than 70% of the townships have established mediation organizations. In the work of consolidating and establishing People's Mediation Organizations, all localities have established and promoted mediation work and trained People's Mediation Committee members through circuit courts. Liuzhou, Hengyang, Gaoan, Jiujiang and other counties and cities have also trained mediation committee members, organizing them to study policies and laws in order to improve their professional level.

    Areas where People's Mediation Organizations have been established have closely integrated mediation work with production. Many mediation committees in rural areas, based on the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, pay special attention to mediating disputes between team members and between members of the cooperatives, thus greatly promoting internal unity among the people and boosting production. In Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, farmers Ni Caiping and Zhan Zhengfa used to quarrel frequently over water use, which affected production. After mediation by the mediation committee, Ni Caiping and Zhan Zhengfa greatly increased their enthusiasm for production, and they also took care of and helped each other during production. Because the grassroots mediation organizations in various places have promptly resolved the disputes of the broad masses of the people, they have been generally welcomed. Many long-standing disputes that could not be resolved have also been resolved smoothly. In Linxiang County, Hunan Province, Huayuan Township and Junwang Village were not united due to the issue of firewood mountains. After mediation by the mediation committee, the production mood of the broad masses of the people was stabilized. They said with satisfaction: If it weren't for the mediation committee, everyone would be fighting, who could concentrate on production! Many disharmonious families have also become harmonious and united families after mediation by the mediation committee.

    As mediation work in various places has been strengthened, the number of cases accepted by the people's courts has decreased accordingly. This allows the people's courts to concentrate their efforts on handling major cases that seriously violate national policies and laws and undermine economic construction. In Guangzhou Central District, after the establishment of mediation organizations, the number of cases received by the people's court decreased to only one-half of what it was before the establishment of the mediation organizations.

### 中南各地积极开展人民调解工作

    中南各地积极开展人民调解工作
    中南各地积极开展人民调解工作。据全区四百一十九个县、市不完全统计，已有人民调解委员会八千七百五十一个。湖北省黄陂、江西省高安等县有百分之七十以上的乡建立了调解组织。各地在整顿和建立人民调解组织的工作中，都通过巡回法庭建立和推动调解工作及培养人民调解委员。柳州、衡阳、高安、九江等县市还集训了调解委员，组织他们学习政策和法令，以提高业务水平。
    已经建立人民调解组织的地区，都密切结合生产进行调解工作。农村中许多调解委员会根据互助合作运动发展的情况，特别注意调解组员之间和社员之间的纠纷，因而大大地促进了人民内部的团结，推动了生产。江西省余江县农民倪财平和詹正发过去经常为用水问题发生争执，影响生产。经调解委员会调解后，倪财平和詹正发的生产积极性大大提高，在生产时还互相照顾和帮助。由于各地基层调解组织及时地解决了广大人民的纠纷，因而普遍受到欢迎。有些长期不能解决的纠纷，也都得到了顺利的解决。湖南省临湘县花园乡和君王村为柴山问题，互不团结，经调解委员会调解后，安定了广大人民的生产情绪。他们满意地说：不是调解委员会，大家都去打架了，谁还能安心生产呢！许多不和睦的家庭，经过调解委员会的调解，也都变为和睦团结的家庭。
    由于各地调解工作日益加强，使人民法院受理的案件相应减少。这样就可使人民法院集中力量处理严重违犯国家政策法令和破坏经济建设的重大案件。广州市中区自建立调解组织后，人民法院收到的案件曾减少到只有在调解组织建立前的二分之一。
