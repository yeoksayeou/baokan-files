    The Weinan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shaanxi Province Actively Supplies Agricultural Tools for the Summer Harvest
    The supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties of the Weinan Special District, Shaanxi Province, are actively carrying out the supply of agricultural tools for the summer harvest. As of May 10th, the summer harvest agricultural tools supplied to farmers by the supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the special district include more than 203,000 brooms, more than 72,000 wooden forks, more than 5,700 wooden shovels, more than 99,000 sickles, more than 4,000 chaff cutters, and a large number of other agricultural tools, with a total value of 2.77 billion yuan.
    This year, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Weinan Special District have generally made relatively adequate preparations for the supply of summer harvest agricultural tools. However, some agricultural tools, such as brooms and wooden forks, have experienced a situation where supply falls short of demand in some areas. After discovering this situation, the Weinan Special District Office of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Cooperatives promptly instructed the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties to continue to vigorously purchase summer harvest agricultural tools, and dispatched cadres to various counties to assist in carrying out the work. At present, the Huayin County Federation of Cooperatives is organizing farmers through the local people's government to purchase brooms in the mountains. The cooperatives in Weinan and Dali counties have newly purchased 12,000 brooms in Mei County and Chang'an. The Weinan County Federation of Cooperatives also organized lower-level cooperatives to adjust agricultural tools such as wooden forks among themselves. Many areas have strengthened the work of organizing handicraft workers for processing.

    陕西渭南专区供销合作社积极供应夏收农具
    陕西省渭南专区各县供销合作社积极展开夏收农具的供应工作。截至五月十日止，全专区供销合作社已供应到农民手中的夏收农具，有扫帚二十万零三千多把、木杈七万二千多把、木掀五千七百多把、镰刀九万九千多把、铡刀四千多条，以及大批其他的农具，共值二十七亿七千余万元。
    今年渭南专区各地供销合作社，一般都对夏收农具供应工作作了比较充分的准备，但有的农具，如扫帚、木杈等，已在部分地区发生供不应求的现象。陕西省合作社联合社渭南专区办事处发现这一情况后，及时指示各县供销合作社继续大力采购夏收农具，并派出干部分赴各县协助开展工作。目前，华阴县合作社联合社正通过当地人民政府组织农民到山里采购扫帚；渭南、大荔两县的合作社已在郿县、长安新采购扫帚一万二千把。渭南县合作社联合社还组织下级社互相调剂木杈等农具。许多地区都加强了组织手工业者加工的工作。
