Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The American authorities are recklessly intensifying their efforts to organize a Southeast Asian aggressive alliance, paving the way for expanding the war in Indochina. According to Western news agencies, US President Eisenhower stressed at a press conference in Washington on the 19th that establishing a Southeast Asian alliance is the "foundation of American policy." Eisenhower also stated that if Britain does not participate, the United States will disregard Britain and directly bring together two Commonwealth countries, Australia and New Zealand, and establish this Eastern aggressive bloc "with the participation of Asian countries." The so-called participation of Asian countries is said to be the preparation to include Thailand, the Philippines, and the three puppet regimes of Indochina in order to conceal the Western colonial nature of this aggressive bloc.

Eisenhower's remarks confirm that Washington is taking advantage of the obstacles created by the US delegation at the Geneva Conference to accelerate the implementation of its plan to establish a new military bloc in the Pacific region. As early as when Dulles fled back to Washington after suffering a diplomatic defeat in the first week in Geneva, there were reports suggesting that Washington was determined to establish this aggressive bloc during the Geneva Conference. According to this plan, the US delegation repeatedly created new obstacles to resolving the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference, first on the issue of evacuating French wounded and prisoners of war from Dien Bien Phu, and now on the substantive issue of restoring peace throughout Indochina. Simultaneously with the US delegation's activities in Geneva to create a tense atmosphere, the United States launched intense diplomatic activities. In addition to starting talks with France on the issue of the United States expanding its intervention in the Indochina war, it is also holding a series of talks with several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. From Western news agency reports, it can be seen that these talks revolve around one purpose, which is to accelerate the assembly of the Southeast Asian aggressive alliance while the Geneva Conference is still in progress. Washington officials have even unequivocally made it known that the United States is determined to complete the treaty procedures for establishing the Southeast Asian alliance around June 30, so that the US Congress has time to approve the treaty before the recess.

Currently, the restricted meeting on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference is underway. All kinds of facts show that the United States is not at all interested in reaching a reasonable agreement through consultation at the conference, but still stubbornly adheres to the "position of strength" policy that has already been thwarted, attempting to dominate the negotiations in Geneva with intimidation and blackmail tactics. Agence France-Presse reporter Elly pointed out on the 19th that the United States is holding a series of military talks to plan the Southeast Asian alliance, with the aim of "influencing the Communists negotiating in Geneva." He said that the United States is also planning to come up with a threatening so-called "declaration of intent" "joint statement." Elly pointed out that Eisenhower's emphasis at this time that Southeast Asian "collective security" (i.e., organizing an aggressive alliance) is the foundation of American policy is for the same purpose.

US newspapers pointed out in their reports that Eisenhower's remarks, especially his expression that the United States intends to establish its own military alliance in the Southeast Asian region, which is related to British interests, regardless of Britain, are putting pressure on its "ally." Based on more realistic considerations, British Prime Minister Churchill has repeatedly announced in the British House of Commons that Britain is not prepared to participate in the US plan to organize a Southeast Asian military group during the Geneva Conference, in order to avoid undermining the opportunity for the conference to reach some kind of agreement. The fact that Britain actually expressed its own views made Washington very annoyed, which is why the US President personally came out to wave the whip at it. Washington's policy remains: to drag Britain into the water. As long as one considers the Republican government's diplomatic policy principle of using others as cat's-paws, one can see what dangers the group plan currently being arranged by the United States contains for the countries that will partner with it. Reuters pointed out in a Washington dispatch on the 19th that the US activities to assemble the Southeast Asian alliance "will clear the way diplomatically and in (the US) Congress so that the United States can use some armed forces for intervention (in Indochina) as soon as possible." This means involving the United States and some countries that follow the United States in forming the Southeast Asian group in another Korean War, the only difference being that this time the cannon fodder of these followers will be mainly used through the so-called Southeast Asian alliance.

### 美国加紧进行拼凑东南亚侵略集团的活动

    美国加紧进行拼凑东南亚侵略集团的活动
    【新华社二十日讯】美国当局正在不顾一切地加紧组织东南亚侵略联盟，为扩大印度支那战争铺平道路。据西方通讯社报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔十九日在华盛顿记者招待会上着重表示：建立东南亚联盟是“美国政策的基础”。艾森豪威尔并且表示，如果英国不参加，美国将不顾英国，而迳自纠合两个英联邦国家澳大利亚、新西兰并在“亚洲国家参加下”建立这个东方的侵略集团。所谓亚洲国家参加，据说就是准备把泰国、菲律宾和印度支那的三个傀儡政权搜罗在内，以便掩饰这个侵略集团的西方殖民主义性质。
    艾森豪威尔的谈话证实，华盛顿正在利用美国代表团在日内瓦会议上制造的障碍，加紧推行它的成立太平洋方面新的军事集团的计划。早在杜勒斯因为在日内瓦的第一周遭到外交上的失败而跑回华盛顿去的时候，就有消息暗示，华盛顿决心要在日内瓦会议期间把这个侵略集团建立起来。按照这个计划，美国代表团就在日内瓦会议上一再制造解决印度支那问题的新的障碍，先是在撤运奠边府法军伤俘问题上，现在又在关于恢复整个印度支那和平的实质问题上。与美国代表团在日内瓦的这种制造紧张气氛的活动同时，美国展开了紧张的外交活动。除了已开始和法国会谈美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的问题外，还在和东南亚及太平洋若干国家举行一系列会谈。从西方通讯社的报道中可以看出，这些会谈都围绕着一个目的，就是要在日内瓦会议还在进行的时候，把东南亚侵略联盟加速度地拼凑起来。华盛顿官方人士甚至已毫不含糊地要人了解，美国确定要在六月三十日左右完成建立东南亚联盟的条约手续，以便美国国会在休会前有时间批准这个条约。
    目前，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的限制性会议正在进行。种种事实说明，美国对于通过会议中的协商来达到合理的协议是丝毫不感兴趣的，而仍然死死抱住已经碰壁的“实力地位”政策，企图用恫吓、讹诈伎俩来支配正在日内瓦进行的谈判。法新社记者艾勒里十九日就指出，美国举行一系列的策划东南亚联盟的军事会谈，目的是要“影响在日内瓦进行谈判的共产党”。他说，美国还正在策划要搞出一个威胁性的所谓“说明意图的”“联合声明”。艾勒里指出，艾森豪威尔在这个时候出来强调东南亚“集体安全”（按即组织侵略联盟）是美国政策的基础，正是为了同样的目的。
    美国报纸在报道中指出，艾森豪威尔的谈话中特别表示美国打算不顾英国而自行在和英国利益攸关的东南亚地区成立自己的军事联盟，是对它的这个“盟国”施加压力。根据较为现实的考虑，英国首相邱吉尔曾在英国下院一再宣布英国不准备在日内瓦会议进行期间来参加美国的组织东南亚军事集团的计划，以免破坏会议取得某种协议的机会。英国竟然表示自己的主张这个事实，使华盛顿感到十分恼怒，这就是美国总统亲自出来向它挥动鞭子的原因。华盛顿的政策仍然是：把英国拖下水。只要考虑到共和党政府的利用别人火中取栗的外交政策原则，就可以看到美国目前正在安排的集团计划对于将和它合伙的国家包含着什么危险。路透社在十九日华盛顿消息中指出，美国拼凑东南亚联盟的活动，“将在外交上和（美国）国会中扫清道路，使美国能及早使用某种武装部队进行（对印度支那的）干涉”。这就是说把美国及一些追随美国搞东南亚集团的国家卷入另外一个朝鲜战争，区别只在于这次将通过所谓东南亚联盟主要使用这些追随者的炮灰。
