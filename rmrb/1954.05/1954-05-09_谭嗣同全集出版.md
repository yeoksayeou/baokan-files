In the reformist political activities of the 1890s in China, Tan Sitong represented the more progressive wing. To some extent, his works demonstrated a tendency towards materialism and showed the courage to challenge the old feudal system and culture. His writings had a certain progressive significance under the historical conditions of the time. Now, Sanlian Bookstore has organized and published his complete works, which provides useful material for those who study modern Chinese political history and intellectual history. The complete book is divided into four volumes. The first volume is essays, the second volume is narrative prose, the third volume is letters, and the fourth volume is poetry and other rhyming prose. The appendix contains biographical materials about Tan Sitong written by Liang Qichao and Ouyang Yuqian.

    谭嗣同全集出版
    在我国十九世纪九十年代改良派的政治活动中，谭嗣同代表比较进步的一翼。在他的著作中，在某种程度内表现了唯物论的倾向，表现了和封建的旧制度、旧文化挑战的勇气。他的著作在当时的历史条件下具有一定的进步意义。现在，三联书店把他的全集整理出版，这对于研究我国近代政治史、思想史的人们提供了有益的资料。全书共分四卷，第一卷是论文，第二卷是记叙性的散文，第三卷是书信，第四卷是诗及其他韵文。附录中收集了梁启超、欧阳予倩所写的有关谭嗣同的传记材料。
