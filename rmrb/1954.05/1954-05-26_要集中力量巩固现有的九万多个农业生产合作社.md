The agricultural producers' cooperatives across the country have developed from more than 14,000 last year to more than 95,000 by this spring. This is a major victory in the implementation of the general task of the state during the transition period in rural areas. The cultivated land area of these more than 90,000 cooperatives accounts for only a little over 2% of the total cultivated land in the country, and its direct contribution to the development of agricultural economy is still very small; but in terms of its impact on the rural cooperative movement, it is of great significance. With these more than 90,000 cooperatives, we can use living facts to persuade more farmers, so that they realize that socialist cooperative production is the only way to eliminate rural poverty, and believe that taking this road is foolproof. Relying on these more than 90,000 cooperatives, we can also cultivate and train tens of thousands of advanced elements and leading backbones in managing the cooperative economy in practice, and expand the Party's leadership in the socialist cause. That is to say, the preparation of mass ideology and the preparation of leading talents needed for the development of the rural socialist revolution movement in the future will be undertaken by these more than 90,000 cooperatives. Running these more than 90,000 cooperatives well not only represents the wishes of the Party and the wishes of the more than 1.7 million peasant households that have joined the cooperatives, but also represents the wishes of millions of farmers who have not yet joined the cooperatives. They hope to learn a lot of knowledge and experience in the process of growth of this batch of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and prove that cooperatives are indeed beneficial to them. When their wishes are fulfilled, it will be the time when the situation of the cooperative movement will further surge.

According to recent materials, the vast majority of comrades in various regions can conscientiously and wholeheartedly lead the work of this batch of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Most of these cooperatives also have the conditions to be run well. However, some working comrades, after the work of building cooperatives has just been completed, have developed a blind optimism and relaxed their leadership over agricultural producers' cooperatives. This tendency may create new dangers in the work, and may cause the organization of some cooperatives to disintegrate and collapse. Sufficient vigilance must be aroused. Although according to the original plan, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives to be developed from last winter to this spring was more than 35,000, and the result was more than 95,000, the work was very smooth, which cannot be denied; however, not all cooperatives are smooth in all aspects, nor can all cooperatives continue to move forward without encountering any difficulties. The foundations of more than 90,000 cooperatives vary; some of them were hastily established in the absence of preparation or insufficient preparation. This will inevitably lead to an unsolidified state within the cooperatives; and some class alien elements will take the opportunity to infiltrate and destroy the cooperative cause by using the form of cooperatives. Even in those cooperatives with a relatively good foundation and good conditions in all aspects, some difficulties that were not expected may often be encountered after the establishment of the cooperative, and the most common is the phenomenon of chaos in production.

Originally, in the case of individual management, every farmer knew how to actively arrange production according to their respective needs; now that it has become collective management, everyone is expecting and waiting for the person in charge to arrange it uniformly. If the person in charge of the cooperative is also lacking in organizational experience, the selfish and undisciplined habits of the small peasant producers will immediately erupt. Phenomena such as idling, waste, internal mutual complaints, and lack of unity will increase. If these situations are allowed to develop, they will shake everyone's confidence in running the cooperative well, and may even cause some members to think about withdrawing from the cooperative. At these difficult junctures, if the leaders understand the situation, have foresight, and can take a firm attitude and effective measures to help and support them, then the work can be improved and the atmosphere of disintegration will be dispelled; if the leaders themselves have a blind optimism, have no understanding of these difficulties, and are even less prepared to overcome them, then they may also be shaken, let go of the work, and allow the organization of the cooperative to disintegrate or even collapse. The latter situation once appeared in some areas last year. This lesson reminds us: we must be good at winning victories, but also be better at consolidating victories; blind optimism and the mood of tightening up first and then loosening up are not desirable.

The central link in consolidating more than 90,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives is to quickly establish and improve production order, and overcome the phenomenon of production chaos that is very likely to occur in the transformation of production relations. Since the most direct demand of farmers participating in cooperatives is to produce more grain and earn more income. And more grain and more income depend on whether current production can be carried out in an orderly manner, then the quality of production work has naturally become the main issue of common concern. If production can be carried out from the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative based on the principle of making the best use of talent, land, and materials, then people who join the cooperative can believe that there is hope for increasing production, that participating in the cooperative will be beneficial, and that active labor will get the reward it deserves without suffering losses. In this way, the internal unity of the cooperative will be strengthened, the advanced elements will be more active, the wavering people will gradually become firm, and the saboteurs will have no skills to use and will be isolated. Conversely, if we are satisfied with the victory that the cooperative has been established, and only recite the superiority of the cooperative to the members in vain, and relax the leadership of production work, it will not help the actual situation.

We must help each agricultural producers' cooperative, after arranging the current agricultural operations and agreeing on a few extremely important systems, promptly formulate practical annual production plans or seasonal production plans with general programs based on their own conditions. Without a plan, it is impossible to do a good job in collective production. This plan must be placed on a reliable basis and give full play to the role of labor and financial resources within the cooperative. This plan should sufficiently estimate the possibility of greatly improving labor efficiency after collectivization, estimate the convenient conditions for the unified use of land and major production tools, and in terms of land processing and construction, in terms of improving technical operations such as deep plowing and moisture retention, rational close planting, seedling protection and pest prevention, especially in increasing fertilizer, universally cultivating land fertility, and changing the state of uneven harvests in the original individual management period, make practical and specific requirements. More importantly, when formulating the plan, do not only base it on the imagination of the person in charge of the cooperative, but go from top to bottom and from bottom to top, through all members of the cooperative to participate in discussions, make suggestions, and think of ways. This plan can generate a force to mobilize the masses and become a program of struggle that all members actively support and endorse. With a general plan, we must also arrange the work of various departments and sections, and first make a plan for sowing, cultivating, and topdressing operations in the first quarter. For cooperatives with more serious chaos, this operating plan can also be formulated earlier than the formulation of the overall production plan, so as to stabilize the mood of the masses as soon as possible and bring all members of the cooperative into the orbit of collective production. While formulating the plan, we should immediately establish a labor organization, stipulate labor divisions (such as grouping teams, contracting farming and contracting production, etc.), labor remuneration and labor reward and punishment systems that are suitable for the current specific situation and the level of the masses, so that the production plan can be transformed into practical action on the basis of the responsibility system (even if it is simple and low-level).

The process of arranging production is inseparable from organizing the masses and educating the masses. We must pay attention to mobilizing rural branches and Party members to assume full responsibility for leading the masses; mobilizing organized masses such as the Communist Youth League and women's federations to stand at the forefront of the production front and actively lead the masses. We must rely on the solid unity of poor and middle peasants, tap the potential in production, and fight against exploiting elements and saboteurs who have infiltrated the community to carry out destructive activities. Through this struggle, we will gradually eliminate the influence of capitalism on the thinking of farmers and raise their socialist awareness. For members who have wavering emotions, we must explain to them in simple and easy-to-understand ways with cited examples: joining the cooperative will not suffer losses; some of the difficulties that arise in the initial establishment of the cooperative are by no means because the cooperative system is not good, but because everyone has not really cooperated well; as long as everyone's sense of responsibility for the common cause is improved, we work together to produce, abide by labor discipline, overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and bring the collective strength into play, these difficulties can be quickly overcome. After repeated explanations, if there are still a few members who insist on requesting to withdraw from the cooperative, they should be allowed to withdraw in accordance with the procedures of the cooperative constitution. In short, for the wavering mentality of some members, we should only help them correct it with a sympathetic and caring attitude; we cannot pre-emptively affirm that their attitude is unchangeable, simply announce that they will be allowed to withdraw voluntarily, let alone think that these farmers had previously expressed their willingness to join the cooperative, and now they have shown wavering is "making trouble," and thus mistakenly attack them. If we treat farmers with crude methods instead of patient ideological education, it can only destroy the development of the cooperative cause in objective terms.

The consolidation and improvement of agricultural producers' cooperatives is a long and arduous task, and it is impossible to do everything well in a short period of time. Every job in every community, such as improving management, improving production technology, and consolidating internal unity, requires great effort to gradually achieve. In the past few years, cooperatives will develop at a rate of several times per year, and every year we have to consolidate the old and build new ones, and the Party's leadership tasks are becoming more and more arduous. We must improve the leadership level of Party organizations and workers at all levels to meet the needs of the objective situation. This requires resolutely implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, shifting the focus of rural work to mutual assistance and cooperation, and shifting to the production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation; we must systematically and uniformly deploy tasks within the Party and mobilize all comrades who manage rural work to come to this new revolutionary struggle and learn to master the art of this struggle; we must resolutely change the practice of only sending a few experts to lead mutual assistance and cooperation, while using most of the strength in the general leadership of production.

On the premise of strengthening the Party's guiding role, we must also fully rely on the strength of the masses. Therefore, we must overcome the style of doing everything for the masses, rely on the masses to run agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and pay attention to systematically using representative meetings of mutual assistance and cooperation and other appropriate forms
(such as mutual assistance and cooperation networks, etc.) to organize the masses to exchange experiences and learn from each other. The people in charge of the Party's leadership of rural work should also participate in this learning at the same time, in order to summarize and use advanced experience from the masses to guide more masses. We must also pay attention to systematically cultivating activists and model figures who have emerged successively in the movement, and constantly strengthen and expand the reserve team for the Party's leadership of the cooperative movement. In this way, we can lead the later ones through the advanced, rely on the old to help the new, and form a cooperative movement that is led and mass-based.

### 要集中力量巩固现有的九万多个农业生产合作社

    要集中力量巩固现有的九万多个农业生产合作社
    全国各地的农业生产合作社，到今年春季为止，已从去年的一万四千多个发展到九万五千多个。这是国家过渡时期总任务在农村执行中的一项重大胜利。这九万多个社的耕地面积，仅占全国耕地总数百分之二强，它对发展农业经济的直接贡献还是很微小的；但就它对农村合作化运动的影响来说，是具有十分重大的作用。有了这九万多个社，就可以用活的事实去说服更多的农民，使他们认识到社会主义的合作生产是消灭乡村贫困的唯一道路，相信走这条路是万无一失的。依靠这九万多个社，还可以在实践中培养和训练出几万、几十万个经营合作经济的先进分子和领导骨干，扩大党在社会主义事业中的领导力量。这就是说，今后农村社会主义革命运动的发展所需要的群众思想的准备和领导人材的准备，都要由这九万多个社担当起来。办好这九万多个社，不只是代表着党的愿望，代表着已经入社的一百七十多万农户的愿望，而且也代表着千百万还没有入社的农民的愿望。他们希望在这一批农业生产合作社成长的过程中，学到许多知识和经验，证实合作社确实对他们有好处。当他们的这种愿望一经达到的时候，也就是合作化运动进一步高涨形势到来的时候。
    根据最近的材料，各地区绝大部分同志都能兢兢业业地全力领导这一批农业生产合作社的工作。这些社绝大部分也都有办好的条件。但是，有一部分工作同志，当建社工作刚刚完成之后，就发生了一种盲目乐观的情绪，放松了对农业生产合作社的领导。这种倾向可能造成工作中新的危险，可能使一部分合作社的组织涣散和瓦解。必须引起足够的警惕。虽然按照原定的计划，去冬今春农业生产合作社要发展到三万五千多个，而结果发展到九万五千多个，工作很顺利，这是不容否认的；但是，并不是所有的社在一切方面都是顺利的，也不是所有的社都可以一直前进不遇到任何困难的。九万多个社基础的好坏不同；其中有一些社是在无准备或准备不足的状况之下，一声号召仓促建立的。这就不免会形成社内的不巩固状态；也会有些阶级异己分子乘机混入，借用合作社的形式来破坏合作事业。就是在那些基础较好、各方面条件都算不坏的社，建社以后也往往会遇到原来意料不到的一些困难，而最常见的就是生产上的混乱现象。
    原来在个体经营的时候，每个农民都懂得按他们各自的需要积极安排生产；现在变成集体经营，大家就都在指望和等待着负责人来统一安排了。如果合作社的负责人同样是缺乏组织经验的，农民小生产者自私散漫的习气就会马上发作出来。窝工浪费、内部互相埋怨、互不团结等现象就会增多起来。这些情形如果让它发展下去，就会动摇大家对办好合作社的信心，甚至会引起一部分社员的退社思想。在这些困难关头上，如果领导者对情况是了解的，有预见的，并能采取坚定态度和有效措施去帮助和支持他们，那么，工作就能有所改进，涣散的空气就会打消；如果领导者本身就有盲目乐观的情绪，对这些困难毫无认识，更无克服困难的准备，那么，自己也就可能随着发生动摇，对工作放任自流，使合作社的组织涣散以至于瓦解。后一种情形去年在部分地区就曾一度出现过。这种教训提醒我们：要善于取得胜利，还要更善于巩固胜利；盲目乐观、前紧后松的情绪是要不得的。
    巩固九万多个农业生产合作社的中心环节，是迅速地建立和改善生产秩序，克服生产关系变革中极容易发生的生产上的混乱现象。既然农民参加合作社的最直接的要求是多打粮多收入。而多打粮多收入又要取决于现时的生产能否有秩序地进行，那么，生产工作做得好坏，就自然地成为大家共同关心的主要问题。如果从建社开始就能本着人尽其才、地尽其力、物尽其用的原则进行生产，那就可以使入社的人们相信增加生产是有希望的，参加合作社是会得到好处的，积极劳动是会得到应得的代价而不会吃亏的。这样，合作社内部就会更加团结，先进分子就会更加积极，动摇的人就会逐渐坚定，破坏分子就会无技可施而陷于孤立。相反的，如果满足于合作社业已建成的胜利，只向社员们空洞地背诵合作社的优越性，放松生产领导工作，那是无补于实际的。
    我们必须帮助每个农业生产合作社，在安排了当前农事作业、商定好极关紧要的几项制度之后，及时根据他们自身的条件，制订切实可行的具有大体节目的年度生产计划或季节生产计划。没有计划，要搞好集体的生产是不可能的。这种计划必须放在可靠的基础上，充分地发挥社内的劳力、财力的作用。这种计划应该足够地估计到集体化以后劳动效率大大提高的可能性，估计到土地和主要生产工具统一使用的便利条件，在土地加工建设方面，在深耕保墒、合理密植、保苗防害等改进技术操作方面，特别在增加肥料、普遍培养地力，改变原来个体经营时期收成丰歉悬殊状态方面，订出切实而具体的要求。更重要的是制订计划的时候不要只根据社的负责人的想像，而是要自上而下，自下而上地经过全体社员参加讨论、出主意、想办法，这种计划才能发生一种动员群众的力量，才能变成全体成员积极赞助和拥护的斗争纲领。有了总计划，还要安排好各部门各段落的工作，首先要作好第一季度内的播种、中耕、追肥等作业计划。对于混乱现象较为严重的社，这种作业计划，还可以在总的生产计划制订前提早制订，以便早日安定群众情绪，将全体社员纳入集体生产的轨道。在订定计划的同时，应即建立劳动组织，规定适合于当前具体情况的和群众水平的劳动分工（如分组分队，包耕包产等）、劳动报酬和劳动奖惩制度，使生产计划能够在责任制（那怕是简单的低级的也好）的基础上变为实际的行动。
    安排生产的过程，是和组织群众和教育群众密切不可分的。必须注意动员乡村支部和党员担负领导群众的全部责任；动员青年团、妇女会等有组织的群众，站在生产战线的前列，积极带动群众。必须依靠贫农和中农的巩固团结，发掘生产中的潜力，并和混入社内进行破坏活动的剥削分子、破坏分子做斗争。通过这种斗争逐步清除农民思想中所受资本主义的影响，提高他们的社会主义觉悟。对于部分发生动摇情绪的社员，要用浅近易懂、引证实例的方式，向他们解释：加入合作社是不会吃亏的；初办的合作社出现的一些困难，决不是因为合作社制度不好，而是由于大家没有真正合作好；只要大家对共同事业的责任心提高，齐心努力生产，遵守劳动纪律，克服无人负责现象，把集体力量发挥出来，这些困难就能很快地克服。经过反复地解释之后，如果仍然有少数社员坚持要求退社，应允许他们按照社章的手续退出。总之，对于部分社员的摇摆心理，只应该本着同情爱护的态度帮助他们纠正；既不可预先肯定他们的这种态度是不可改变的，简单宣布任其自愿退出了事，更不可认为这部分农民原先曾表示过自愿入社，现在表现了动摇就是“捣乱”，因而错误地去打击他们。对待农民如果以粗暴手段代替耐心的思想教育，在客观上只能是破坏合作事业的发展。
    农业生产合作社的巩固和提高是一个长期艰苦的任务，不可能在短时期内把一切都做好。每一个社的每一项工作，如经营管理的改善，生产技术的改进，内部团结的巩固等，都需要费很大气力才可能逐步实现。最近几年内，合作社将会以每年增加几倍的速度向前发展，每年要巩固旧的，又要建立新的，党的领导任务越来越繁重了。必须提高各级党组织和工作人员的领导水平，以适应客观形势的需要。这就要求坚决地执行党中央和毛主席的指示，把农村工作的重心转移到互助合作方面来，转到以互助合作为中心的增产运动方面来；要在党内有系统地统一地布置任务，调动所有管理农村工作的同志都到这个新的革命斗争中来，学习掌握这种斗争的艺术；要坚决地改变只派几个专家领导互助合作，而将大部分力量用在一般化的领导生产的作法。
    在加强党的指导作用的前提下，还要充分地依靠群众的力量。因此，要克服包办代替的作风，要依靠群众来办农业生产合作社和互助组，要注意有系统地运用互助合作代表会议和其他适宜的形式
  （如互助合作网等等），组织群众交流经验，互相学习。党的领导农村工作的人员也要同时参加这种学习，以便总结和运用来自群众的先进经验，去指导更多的群众。还要注意有计划地培养在运动中陆续涌现出的积极分子和模范人物，不断增强和扩大党领导合作化运动的后备队。这样，就可以通过先进带动后起，依靠老的帮助新的，形成一个有领导的、群众性的合作化运动。
