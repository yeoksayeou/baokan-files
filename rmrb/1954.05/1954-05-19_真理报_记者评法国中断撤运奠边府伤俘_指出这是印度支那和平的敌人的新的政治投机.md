Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th: The "Pravda" published an article by its special correspondents in Geneva, Zhukov and Prishevsky.

The reporters said in the article: On May 17th, just as the foreign ministers were holding their first restricted meeting to discuss the Indochina issue, the enemies of peace in Indochina launched a new political speculation surrounding the issue of the wounded and captured officers and soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force in Dien Bien Phu who surrendered to the Vietnamese People's Army on May 7th. Newspapers published news with banner headlines saying that the evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu, which had just begun on May 14th, had been interrupted.

The reporters emphasized the deliberate and obviously provocative obstruction of the wounded evacuation work by the French military headquarters, and recalled what had happened in the week after May 10th, when Pham Van Dong, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, representing his government, expressed at the Geneva Conference his willingness to allow the evacuation of seriously wounded personnel of the French Expeditionary Force. The authors wrote that, as can be seen from the facts cited above, the interruption of the wounded evacuation work should be the responsibility of the French military headquarters, which was acting on the orders of Paris to overturn the agreement already reached on the evacuation of the wounded. Their purpose in obstructing the evacuation of the wounded was to mislead French public opinion, which had expressed deep satisfaction with the humanitarian decision taken by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The reactionary French newspapers created a smokescreen with lies and slanders. These newspapers were filled with vile and slanderous attacks on the Vietnamese People's Army, attempting to shift the responsibility for interrupting the evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu to the other side.

It is said that when the Dien Bien Phu fortress fell on May 7th, the condition of the wounded French soldiers was so bad that the French authorities feared the French public would learn about the situation. Therefore, they decided to obstruct the evacuation of the wounded, because the returning wounded might tell the truth that the French authorities feared.

The enemies of peace in Indochina, by playing deceptive tricks on such an important issue as the fate of the wounded in Dien Bien Phu, are attempting to aggravate the tense atmosphere of the Geneva Conference and create difficulties for the foreign ministers who are now holding restricted meetings to discuss issues of great importance to the people of France and Indochina, as well as to the people of other countries. This kind of deception will naturally arouse the rightful indignation of all honest men and women.

### “真理报”记者评法国中断撤运奠边府伤俘  指出这是印度支那和平的敌人的新的政治投机

    “真理报”记者评法国中断撤运奠边府伤俘
    指出这是印度支那和平的敌人的新的政治投机
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”刊载了该报驻日内瓦特派记者茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基的一篇文章。
    记者在文章中说：五月十七日，正当外长们举行第一次限制性会议讨论印度支那问题的时候，印度支那和平的敌人围绕着在五月七日向越南人民军投降的奠边府法国远征军受伤官兵的问题，开始了一次新的政治投机。各报以通栏标题刊载消息说：五月十四日刚开始的撤运奠边府伤员的工作已经中断。
    记者着重指出了法军总司令部对于伤员撤运工作所加的蓄意的、显然是挑拨性的阻挠，并回顾了五月十日以后，即在越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同代表他的政府在日内瓦会议上表示愿意允许撤运法国远征军的重伤人员以后一个星期内所发生的事情。作者写道，从上面所引的事实可以看出，伤员撤运工作的中断，应当由法军总司令部负责，而法军总司令部又是奉巴黎的命令来推翻在撤运伤员问题上已经达成的协议的。他们阻挠伤员撤运工作的目的是要迷惑对越南民主共和国政府所采取的人道决定表示深刻满意的法国舆论。
    法国反动报纸用谎言和诽谤造成了一道烟幕。这些报纸充斥着对越南人民军的卑鄙的诽谤性的攻击，企图把中断撤运奠边府伤员工作的责任推到他方身上。
    据说，在五月七日奠边府堡垒失守的时候，法军伤员的处境是如此恶劣，以致法国当局唯恐法国公众知道这种情况。因此，他们决定阻挠撤运伤员的工作，因为撤回的伤员可能说出法国当局所害怕的真实情况。
    印度支那和平的敌人在有关奠边府伤员命运的这样一个重要问题上玩弄欺骗手段，是企图加剧日内瓦会议的紧张空气，给现在正在举行限制性会议来讨论对法国和印度支那人民以及对其他国家人民都非常重要的问题的外长们制造困难。这种欺骗手段自然只会引起一切正直的男女的正当的愤慨。
