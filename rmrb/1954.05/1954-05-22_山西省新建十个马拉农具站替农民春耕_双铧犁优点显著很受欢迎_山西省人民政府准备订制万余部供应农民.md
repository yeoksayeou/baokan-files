    [Our Newspaper] Shanxi Province has newly established ten animal-drawn farm implement stations, which have used double-wheel, double-share plows to plow approximately 5,500 mu of land for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams during this year's spring plowing season, achieving great results. The double-share plows have demonstrated significant effectiveness in actual use and have been warmly welcomed by the farmers.
    The double-share plow is equipped with two plow bottoms, equivalent to the work of two plows. It can plow a width of one chi and two cun at a time, resulting in high plowing efficiency and saving labor. When the Nanguanzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hongdong County used a double-share plow, with two oxen and one worker, they plowed ten mu of land per day. The Changshuanzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinzhuang, Changzi County, using three donkeys and one worker, plowed twelve mu of land per day. During an on-site trial of the double-share plow in Dazhai Township, Yushe County, using two mules and one worker, plowed one and a half mu of land per hour, or twelve mu of land per day. This is more than double the efficiency of the old plow pulled by two oxen, which could only plow four mu of land per day with one person. The double-share plow has demonstrated its strong soil-turning capability in various locations. In Jincheng County and Changzi County, where new-style walking plows could not turn the soil in the past, the double-share plow could turn the soil this year, and the plowing was deep and even, generally reaching a depth of about seven cun, which is more than three cun deeper than the old plow and one and a half cun deeper than the new-style walking plow. Furthermore, because the bottom of the double-share plow is flat, the plowing leaves the land surface level. The farmers also felt that the double-share plow was light and easy to use. In the past, they had to use great effort to hold the old plow when plowing, but now the double-share plow is particularly stable and does not require holding, reducing fatigue.
    When the animal-drawn farm implement stations plowed land for mutual aid and cooperative organizations, they widely mobilized farmers to visit and promote the double-share plow on-site, while also conducting socialist ideological education for the farmers. The CCP Yushe County Committee and the County People's Government, taking advantage of the establishment of the animal-drawn farm implement station in the county, organized county and district cadres, township cadres from forty-eight townships, agricultural production cooperative chairmen, mutual aid team leaders, labor models, activists on the agricultural production front, as well as middle school, high school students and faculty, a total of 10,000 people, to hold a celebration meeting in Dazhai Township on April 21st and 22nd. The double-share plow was demonstrated on-site, and Zhang Zhiquan, an agricultural labor model, introduced the process and achievements of the farmers in Dazhai Township taking the path of collectivization. The Yushe County Cultural Center, Health Center, Farm, Xinhua Bookstore and other units formed a propaganda team, using radios, pictures, physical models, cartoons, comic strips, etc., combined with the content of the meeting, to conduct a profound socialist education for the attendees. At this meeting, the visiting farmers not only saw the benefits of the double-share plow, but also realized that only by organizing and improving technology can they use the double-share plow. The head of the Xia Chiyu mutual aid team said, "No matter how good the machine is, it cannot be used without organization. Small plots of land prevent the machine from turning around. When we go back, we must run the mutual aid team well and strive to establish a cooperative to use animal-drawn mechanized farming." On the day the double-share plow was tested in Xiliang Township, Yicheng County, where Wu Chun'an, the winner of the Gold Star Medal, was located, almost all the farmers from Xiliang Village participated, and people from neighboring villages also came to visit. Many farmers scrambled to try plowing, and women also plowed smoothly. After the news of the successful experiment spread, within ten days, according to Wu Chun'an's statistics, about 3,000 people visited the double-share plow. Many people underwent significant ideological changes after visiting the double-share plow. For example, Li Guoqing, a member of the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative, was not very much in favor of the fixed rent system for land in the past, but now he said, "Why shouldn't I be in favor? Can these two pieces of land alone produce more grain?" Li Guoxiang, a high school graduate, was very uneasy when he first became the cooperative's accountant, but seeing the current double-share plow and thinking of the future tractors, he strengthened his determination to be a good accountant.
    The actual use of the double-share plow in various parts of Shanxi Province has made farmers see that the double-share plow plows quickly, deeply, saves labor, and is also light and convenient. It can be pulled by both horses and oxen, and is therefore warmly welcomed by the farmers. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have requested to purchase and use double-share plows. According to statistics from only four animal-drawn farm implement stations in Shicun, Hongdong County, Xiaoguo, Changzi County, Sunjiazhai, Taiyuan City, and Shidian, Jincheng County, 145 agricultural production cooperatives and nine mutual aid teams have requested to sign usage contracts with the animal-drawn farm implement stations. Yang Guangxing, the chairman of the Nanguanzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hongdong County, requested three times that the double-share plow come to plow their land.
    In order to meet the needs of the masses of farmers, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has decided to invest a large amount of funds from the state to order and purchase more than 10,000 double-share plows from the Shanxi Machine Factory and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, to supply the needs of farmers in large quantities during the summer and autumn plowing seasons.

    山西省新建十个马拉农具站替农民春耕
    双铧犁优点显著很受欢迎
    山西省人民政府准备订制万余部供应农民
    【本报讯】山西省新建立的十个马拉农具站，在今年春耕生产中，用双轮双铧犁代农业生产合作社和互助组耕地约五千五百多亩，成绩很好。双铧犁在实地使用中表现出很大的效力，受到农民的热烈欢迎。
    双铧犁装着两个犁底，能顶两个犁用，一次能耕地一尺二寸宽，耕地效率很高，而且能节省人工。洪洞县南官庄农业生产合作社在用双铧犁耕地时，用两头牛、一个人工，每天耕地十亩；长子县辛庄常拴柱农业生产合作社用三头驴、一个人工，每天耕地十二亩；双铧犁在榆社县大寨乡实地试验时，用两头骡子、一个人工，每小时耕地一亩半，一天耕地十二亩。这就比用两头牛拉的旧犁，一个人每天只能耕四亩地的效率，提高一倍多。双铧犁在各地使用时，表现了翻土能力很强的特长。晋城县和长子县等地，过去用新式步犁翻不转的地，今年用双铧犁就能翻土了，而且犁的深、犁的平，一般耕地的深度达七寸左右，比旧犁深三寸多，比新式步犁深一寸半。又因为双铧犁的底是平的，耕过后的土地上下也都平整。农民们在使用双铧犁时，还感到轻便好用。他们过去用旧犁耕地，要用很大的力气扶犁，现在双铧犁特别稳当，耕地不用扶，减轻了劳累。
    当马拉农具站代互助合作组织耕地时，各地广泛动员农民前往参观，实地推广双铧犁，同时向农民进行社会主义的思想教育。中共榆社县委和县人民政府，趁着该县成立马拉农具站的机会，在四月二十一、二十二两天，组织了县、区干部与四十八个乡的乡干部、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长、劳动模范、农业生产战线上的积极分子，以及中学、高小的学生和教职员等共一万人，在大寨乡召开了庆祝大会。双铧犁当场进行实地试验，同时由农业劳动模范张志全介绍大寨乡农民走合作化道路的经过与成就。榆社县文化馆、卫生院、农场、新华书店等单位组成宣传队伍，利用收音机、图片、实物模型、漫画、连环画等，结合会议内容，向到会的人进行了一次深刻的社会主义教育。在这个会上，参观的农民不仅看到双铧犁的好处，而且认识到只有组织起来改进技术，才能使用双铧犁。下赤峪互助组组长说：“机器再好，不组织起来也不能用，小块地机器不能转身。回去要把互助组办好，争取办社使用马拉机耕地。”双铧犁在金星奖章获得者吴春安所在的翼城县西梁乡试验的那天，除了西梁村的农民几乎全部参加外，邻近各村的人也赶来参观。许多农民抢着试犁，妇女们也犁得很顺利。试验成功的消息传开后，十多天内，据吴春安的统计，参观双铧犁的人就有三千人左右。许多人在参观双铧犁后，思想上起了很大的变化。例如吴春安农业生产合作社社员李国庆，过去对土地实行死租制还不大赞成，现在他说：“为啥不赞成呢，难道光有这两块地就能多打出粮食吗？”高小毕业生李国祥刚当社内会计时很不安心，但他看到现在的双铧犁，想到未来的拖拉机，坚定了当好会计的决心。
    双铧犁在山西省各地的实地使用，使农民不仅看到双铧犁耕地快、耕地深、省人工、又轻便，而且用马和牛都可以拉，因此受到农民的热烈欢迎。不少农业生产合作社和互助组都提出购买和使用双铧犁的要求。仅据洪洞县师村、长子县小郭、太原市孙家寨、晋城县石店四个马拉农具站统计，就有一百四十五个农业生产合作社和九个互助组，要求和马拉农具站订立使用合同。洪洞县南官庄农业生产合作社社长杨广兴曾三次要求双铧犁去给他们耕地。
    为了适应农民群众的要求，山西省人民政府决定由国家投资大批款项，向山西机器厂和华北农业机械总厂订制和订购一万多部双铧犁，在夏耕和秋耕中大量供应农民的需要。
