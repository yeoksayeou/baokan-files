More than 3,000 members of the Forest Survey Team of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government entered the Greater Khingan Mountains in Northeast China and the Bailong River Forest Area in Northwest China in April. The first and second detachments will complete the forest management and survey work of all the forests on the southern slope of the Greater Khingan Mountains within this year, and the third detachment will cooperate with the Northwest team to complete the survey task of the Bailong River Forest Area.

In order to create good conditions for this year's forest survey work, the team members worked hard to prepare during the winter of last year. The second detachment, with more than 300 people, entered the primeval forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains in October last year with more than 300 camels and horses and four cars, and carried out transportation, boundary survey and test line laying work on a line of more than 1,000 kilometers in the Gen River and Yituli River areas. By March of this year, more than 20 warehouses have been established on this transportation line, and more than one million catties of grain have been transported; the boundaries of this year's survey area have been surveyed and the main survey lines have been laid out. The grain, transportation tools, etc. needed for the survey in the Bailong River Forest Area were also fully prepared before the survey.

    森林调查队三千多人进入东北和西北林区
    中央人民政府林业部森林调查队三千多人，已在四月间先后进入东北的大兴安岭和西北的白龙江林区。第一、二大队将在年内完成大兴安岭南坡全部森林的经理调查工作，第三大队配合西北队将完成白龙江林区的调查任务。
    为了给今年森林调查工作创造良好的条件，队员们曾在去年冬季紧张地进行了准备工作。第二大队有三百多人，曾在去年十月间带着骆驼、马三百多匹和汽车四辆进入大兴安岭原始林区，在根河、伊图里河地区长达一千多公里的线路上展开了运输、摸境界和打测线等工作。到今年三月为止，已在这条运输线上建立了二十多个仓库，运去了一百多万斤粮食；摸清了今年调查地区的境界并打出主要测线。白龙江林区调查中所需的粮食、运输工具等，也在调查前准备齐全。
