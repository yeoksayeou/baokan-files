    Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, May 16th (TASS): The election campaign for the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic is being launched ever more widely. The election of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia will be held on June 13th.
    Herdsmen, workers, and intellectuals are enthusiastically nominating the most outstanding people as candidates for people's representatives at their gatherings. Among the candidates are leaders of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, as well as innovators in industry and agriculture. A characteristic of this nomination is that the majority of the candidates were not representatives of the Great People's Hural in the past, but are people who have shown initiative in the past three years.
    The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has formed an election alliance with non-party members to participate in the election of the Great People's Hural. Newspapers have published the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's letter to all voters. In the letter to all voters, the Central Committee called on voters to actively participate in the election and elect candidates of the Party and non-Party election alliance, and called on voters to greet the election day with new achievements in developing various sectors of the national economy and culture.

    蒙古广泛展开大人民呼拉尔的选举运动
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社乌兰巴托十六日讯：蒙古人民共和国日益广泛地展开蒙古大人民呼拉尔的选举运动。蒙古大人民呼拉尔的选举将在六月十三日举行。
    牧民、工人和知识分子在他们的集会上热情地把最优秀的人们提名为人民代表的候选人。候选人中有蒙古人民革命党和政府的领导人及工业和农业的革新者。这次提名的特点是：在候选人中，大多数在过去并不是蒙古大人民呼拉尔代表，而是在最近三年中表现积极的人们。
    蒙古人民革命党与非党人士结成选举联盟，参加蒙古大人民呼拉尔的选举。各报登载了蒙古人民革命党中央委员会告全体选民书。在告全体选民书中，中央委员会号召选民积极参加选举和选举党与非党选举联盟的候选人，并号召选民以发展国民经济和文化各部门的新成就来迎接选举日。
