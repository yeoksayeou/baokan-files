    Many state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in Inner Mongolia have launched a technical innovation movement and achieved results.

    Many processes at the Hohhot Woolen Mill were originally done manually. In January of this year, the factory leadership adopted rationalization proposals put forward by workers Wang Fuhong, Jiang Kunshan, and others. Starting in February, they began three technical reforms: using electric belts to knit sweaters, using machines to dye yarn, and using discarded machines to modify twisting machines. Now, the factory's main processes are all done by machines instead of manual labor. After the technical innovation, the revised production plans for the second, third, and fourth quarters of the year were greatly increased compared to the original plan, with output increasing by 83.2 percent, output value increasing by 76.5 percent, and costs decreasing by 8.37 percent.

    Workers at the Baotou Machinery Factory carried out technical innovations during the labor emulation drive, ensuring that the old production equipment could adapt to the manufacturing of new products. Radiators were the first new product trial-produced by the factory to support basic construction. At the beginning of the trial production, the efficiency was very low due to the lack of special equipment. Technician Sun Min designed a radiator processing machine and special fixtures. Li Baorong, the director of the machinist workshop, added a three-blade tool holder to an old drilling machine to ensure normal production. The workers also converted most of the belt lathes into semi-automatic lathes, increasing the speed from 280 revolutions to 560 revolutions. In the foundry workshop, electric grinding was also used instead of manual grinding. The mold-making materials that ten people could not finish in the past can now be done by two people. Due to the achievements in technical innovation, the factory manufactured 247 kinds of new products in the first quarter of this year.

    In the past, the ash soaking group of the Inner Mongolia Leather Factory in Hailar had poor operating methods, which affected the production of other processes and prevented the factory's machine efficiency from being fully utilized, resulting in the low production efficiency. Cao Fengjiu, the leader of the ash soaking group, studied and adopted the sodium sulfide brushing method for hair removal. On average, 0.9 kilograms of hair can be saved per hide, which can save more than 130 million yuan a year, and the quality has also been significantly improved. At the same time, the production cycle was shortened by two days. Each ash pond holds twenty more hides than before, and the average daily output of ten ponds reaches one hundred and forty hides. If calculated based on an increase of sixty hides per day, the increased output value from April to the end of the year will reach more than 10 billion yuan, thereby solving the factory's weak link—the imbalance of processes—and creating conditions for increasing production by maximizing machine efficiency.

    In addition, the workers in the Hohhot area of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, the Pingdiquan Repair Factory, the Tongliao Automobile Repair Factory, and the Tongliao Power Plant have also launched a technical innovation movement and have achieved certain results. (Dongsheng)

    内蒙古许多国营工厂革新技术获得成绩
    内蒙古许多国营和地方国营企业的职工，开展技术革新运动，获得了成绩。
    呼和浩特毛织厂原来许多工序都是用手工操作。今年一月，该厂领导上采纳了王富宏、降昆山等工人提出的合理化建议，从二月开始进行电带织毛衣、用机器染线和用废机器改制合股机等三项技术改革，现在该厂主要工序都用机器代替手工操作了。在技术革新以后，该厂修改后的第二、三、四季度生产计划比原计划大大提高，产量提高百分之八十三点二；产值提高百分之七十六点五；成本降低百分之八点三七。
    包头机械厂职工在劳动竞赛中进行技术革新，保证了陈旧的生产设备适应新产品的制造工作。暖气片是该厂为支援基本建设而试制的第一种新产品，开始试制时，由于没有专门设备，效率很低，技师孙敏便设计了暖气片加工机和专用卡具；机工车间主任李宝荣又在旧钻床上加了一把三刀刀杆，保证了正常生产。职工们还将大部分皮带车床改为半自动化车床，转速由二百八十转提高到五百六十转。在铸工车间，也用电碾代替了人力碾，过去十个人碾不完的制模子材料，现在两个人就能做完。由于在技术革新方面获得成就，使该厂在今年第一季度就制造了各种新产品二百四十七种。
    海拉尔市内蒙古制革厂浸灰组过去操作方法不好，影响了其他工序的生产，使全厂的机器效能不能发挥，生产效率不能提高。浸灰组组长曹凤久研究采用了硫化碱刷里脱毛法。每张皮平均可节省一斤八两毛，一年就能节约一亿三千多万元，质量也显著提高。同时也缩短了生产周期两天。每个灰池比过去多容纳二十张皮，十个池子平均日产量达到一百四十张皮，如按每天增产六十张皮计算，从四月起到年末的九个月中，增产的产值将达一百余亿元，从而也解决了该厂薄弱环节——工序不平衡问题，为发挥机器效能增加生产创造了条件。
    此外，京包铁路呼和浩特地区职工、平地泉修配厂、通辽市汽车修理厂、通辽发电厂的职工也都掀起了技术革新的运动，并已取得了一定的成绩。（东胜）
