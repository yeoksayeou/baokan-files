Newspaper Review

    Short and Vivid News
    Since May, a fresh and eye-catching column, "Across Fujian," has appeared in the Fujian Daily.
    This column uses short news items to convey various aspects of the Fujian people's struggle, along with the people of the whole country, to build a new life. Opening the May 1st newspaper, one can see the following eight news items in this column: "Shenyang - Fujian," "New Record for Minjiang Tug-Barge Transportation," "Groundbreaking for the First Workers' Club Today," "The Glory of High School Graduates Participating in Labor," "Fujian Scenery to be Brought to the Silver Screen," "Chemical Plant Workers' Gift to 'May Day'," "Busy Tea Picking by Girls in Northeastern Fujian," "Comprehensive Improvement of Jiangshan - Jian'ou Highway." These news items constitute a vivid picture of the people of Fujian actively participating in the construction of the motherland in different positions, and the eight news items together total less than two thousand words. The column appearing after May 1st also has the characteristics of short news items, diverse themes, and wide geographical coverage.
    The news published in the column has been carefully selected, neither a simple list of phenomena nor an accumulation of events. Here, people are attracted and moved by the facts themselves extracted from life. For example, "Shenyang - Fujian" published on May 1st, writes:
      A 7,000-kilowatt water turbine needed by a hydroelectric power plant in our province has recently been successfully trial-manufactured at the state-owned Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory.
      This water turbine weighs about forty tons. The electricity generated by it driving a water turbine generator of the same capacity can supply the electricity needed by ten machine manufacturing factories with three thousand workers, or it can supply lighting electricity for a city like Fuzhou with a population of 500,000. "Large Batch of Sleepers Support Beijing-Shanghai Railway" published on May 4th writes:
      The railway from Shanghai to Beijing, more than a thousand kilometers long, will be renovated to be stronger and flatter this year. The sleepers produced in Fujian bear the glorious task of maintaining this line.
      In the first quarter, approximately 110,000 sleepers from our province have been allocated by the Hankou base factory of the Central Ministry of Railways to the Shanghai Railway Bureau for replacing old railway sleepers along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Pukou-Tianjin lines. In the second quarter, our province will continue to transport 72,000 sleepers for the maintenance of the Jinpu and Beijing-Tianjin railways.
      The work of logging, processing, and transporting these sleepers is proceeding intensely in the forest area upstream of the Minjiang River. When people read these news items, they cannot help but be encouraged by the specific facts of the heroic labor of the working people in various parts of our great motherland.
    The pictures published in conjunction with these short and vivid news items strengthen the effect of publicity. Next to the news item "Handicraft Products Participating in the Leipzig International Fair" on May 5th, is a carefully crafted work - a woodcut depicting the Summer Palace in Beijing - carved in twenty days by Huang Kun, a famous wood painting craftsman in Fuzhou. Next to the news item "On the Land Plowed by Tractors" on May 8th, are two pictures depicting the Changshan Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Yunxiao using tractors to cultivate the vast land, and the farm members engaging in recreational activities happily in their spare time.
    News is first and foremost agitation, and it uses the logic of facts to agitate. The "Across Fujian" column opened by the Fujian Daily once again proves this point. In addition to the Fujian Daily, many other regional newspapers are also working hard to improve news reporting. For example, the New Hunan Daily is working to solve the problem of strengthening the timeliness of news reporting. It can be expected that these efforts will improve the level of news reporting in our newspapers a step further. (Shixin)

    短小生动的新闻
    从五月份以来，在福建日报上出现了一个面目清新、引人注意的专栏：“在福建各地”。
    这个专栏用短小的消息传达着福建人民和全国人民一道为建设新生活而斗争的各个方面。翻开五月一日的报纸，人们可以在这一栏中看到以下的八条消息：“沈阳——福建”、“闽江拖驳运输的新纪录”、“第一工人俱乐部今日兴工”、“参加劳动的高小毕业生的光荣”、“福建风光将搬上银幕”、“化工厂工人们给‘五一’的献礼”、“闽东北姑娘采茶忙”、“江山——建瓯公路进行全面改善”。这些消息构成了一幅福建各地人民在不同的岗位上积极参加祖国建设的生动图景，而八条消息加起来还不到两千字。在五月一日以后出现的专栏，同样具有消息短小和题材多样、地区广泛的特点。
    发表在专栏中的消息，是经过一番选择的，既不是现象罗列，也不是事件的堆砌。在这里，人们被从生活中提炼出来的事实本身吸引着，并受到感动。例如，五月一日发表的“沈阳——福建”，这样写道：
      本省某水力发电厂需要的一台七千瓩的水轮机，最近已在国营沈阳高压开关厂试制成功。
      这台水轮机体重约四十吨，用它带动同样容量的水轮发电机所发出的电力，可以供给十个拥有三千工人的机器制造厂所需电力，也可以供给像福州这样五十万人口的城市照明用电。五月四日发表的“大批枕木支援京沪铁路”写道：
      从上海到北京去的一千多公里铁路，今年将要修整得更加结实平坦。福建出产的枕木担负了维修这条线路的光荣任务。
      在第一季度，约有十一万根本省枕木已由中央铁道部汉口基地厂拨交上海铁路局，作为替换上海到南京、浦口到天津沿线铁路旧枕木用。第二季度，本省将继续输送出七万二千根枕木给津浦和京津铁路维修用。
      这项枕木的采伐、加工和运输工作，正在闽江流域上游林区紧张进行中。当人们读着这些消息的时候，不能不从我们伟大祖国各地劳动人民英勇劳动的具体事实中得到鼓舞。
    配合着这些短小生动的消息刊出的图片，加强了宣传的效果。在五月五日“参加来比锡国际博览会的手工产品”的消息旁边，是福州有名的木画手工艺人黄琨在二十天中赶刻出来的精心作品——一幅描摹北京颐和园的木刻画。在五月八日“在拖拉机翻犁过的土地上”的消息旁边，有着两张描写云霄常山华侨集体农场用拖拉机在广阔的土地上耕种，以及庄员们在工作之余愉快地进行文娱活动的照片。
    新闻首先是鼓动，是用事实的逻辑来进行鼓动。福建日报所辟的“在福建各地”的专栏，又一次证明了这个道理。除福建日报之外，还有不少地区的报纸也在努力改进新闻报道。例如，新湖南报正在着手解决加强新闻报道的时间性的问题。可以预期，这些努力将使我们报纸的新闻报道的水平提高一步。　（湜辛）
