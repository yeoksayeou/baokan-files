    The Soviet Union Emphasizes the Training of Newspaper Workers
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    The Soviet Union highly values the training of newspaper cadres because the cadre issue is of decisive significance for newspaper work. "Pravda," in its May 5th editorial, "The Militant Tasks of the Soviet Press," emphasized the high demands placed on newspaper workers. The editorial stated: "The profession of a newspaper worker is glorious and respected in our society. Only such a newspaper worker is worthy of this noble title, one who enthusiastically fulfills their mission as a newspaper worker according to the Party's requirements, one who loves the newspaper and the newspaper's readers. Newspaper workers must engage with the most diverse issues of economic and cultural development. In order to report on these issues profoundly and expertly, newspaper workers must know to constantly expand their political and general knowledge and enrich their specialized knowledge. To be proficient in what one writes and to understand it well – this is the most important condition for further improving the level of our newspapers."
    There are now thirteen universities across the Soviet Union training newspaper work cadres. Moscow University and Kyiv University have journalism departments. The language departments of universities in Leningrad, the Urals, Rostov, Belarus, Tbilisi, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia all have journalism classes. Last year, more than five hundred students graduated from various universities, and the same number of new students were enrolled. Currently, there are more than three thousand students studying in the universities. In addition, more than seven hundred newspaper workers are participating in correspondence courses without leaving their jobs. The Journalism Department of Moscow University is the largest, with two classes in newspaper and publishing editing, training about one thousand two hundred students. In addition, its correspondence course has more than three hundred students. Last year, graduates from various universities were assigned to work in newspaper editorial offices and publishing houses in provinces and border regions. This year, the Journalism Department of Moscow University alone will have one hundred and fifty-four graduates. Some graduates from the newspaper class of the department will be assigned to work in district newspapers. May 5th

    苏联重视培养报刊工作者
    本报记者　李何
    苏联非常重视报刊工作干部的培养工作。因为干部问题对于报刊工作是有决定意义的。“真理报”在五日社论“苏联报刊的战斗任务”中，着重指出对报刊工作者的高度要求。社论说：“报刊工作者的职业在我们的社会里是光荣的和受尊敬的。只有这样的报刊工作者配得起这个高尚的称号，就是他热情地按照党的要求完成自己的报刊工作者的使命，就是他爱报纸，爱报纸的读者。报刊工作者要接触经济和文化发展的最多样问题。为了深刻地内行地报道这些问题，报刊工作者必须知道，不停地扩大自己政治和一般应有的眼界，充实自己的专门知识。对自己写的东西很内行，很好了解它，——这是进一步提高我们报刊水平的一个最重要条件。”
    苏联全国现在有十三个大学培养着报刊工作干部。莫斯科大学和基辅大学有新闻系。列宁格勒、乌拉尔、罗窝夫、白俄罗斯、第比利斯、哈萨克、中亚细亚等大学的语文系都有新闻班。去年从各大学毕业了五百多个学生，同时也招收了同样数目的新生。现在各大学总共有三千多学生在学习。此外，七百多个报刊工作者不脱离工作地参加函授学习。莫斯科大学的新闻系是最大的，那里有报纸和出版社编辑两个班，培养着约一千二百个学生。此外，它的函授班有三百多学生。去年各大学毕业的学生被派到州、边疆的报纸编辑部和出版社工作。今年仅莫斯科大学新闻系将有一百五十四个学生毕业。该系报纸班的部分毕业生将被派到区报工作。  五月五日
