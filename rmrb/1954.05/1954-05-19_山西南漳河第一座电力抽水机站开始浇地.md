The first electric pumping station newly built on the Zhanghe River in Southern Shanxi began pumping water for irrigation on May 1st.  Located forty li (approximately 20 kilometers) northwest of Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, the right bank of the South Zhanghe River has more than 3,500 mu (approximately 233 hectares) of mountain land that has never been irrigated. The farmers living on the bank watched the river water flow away in vain, unable to divert water for irrigation even in times of drought.  To help farmers escape the threat of drought, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau began construction of the pumping station two years ago, and it was fully completed in April this year. To build this pumping station, the state sent technical personnel and successively invested 184.2 million yuan in loans. Workers from the state-owned Luan Coal Mine Power Plant helped farmers install electric motors, water pumps, and high-voltage lines. They also built a 160-meter-long main canal, a 40-meter-long aqueduct, and more than 20 branch canals.  It can pump 15 tons of water per hour, irrigating 7.5 mu (approximately 0.5 hectares).  So far, 1,600 mu (approximately 107 hectares) have been irrigated.  When people saw the water pump drawing river water to the farmland, they all said, "Agriculture will never be able to overcome natural disasters without the support of industry." The local farmers said even more happily, "If it weren't for the help of our worker elder brothers, we would never have dreamed of using the Zhanghe River's water to irrigate our land."

    山西南漳河第一座电力抽水机站开始浇地
    山西南漳河新建的第一座电力抽水机站已于五月一日开始抽水浇地。距山西省潞城县西北四十里地的南漳河右岸有三千五百多亩山地，从来不能用水浇，住在岸上的农民，眼看着河水白白流过，就是遇有旱灾的时候都无法引水灌田。为了帮助农民摆脱旱灾威胁，山西省人民政府水利局早在两年前就开始了抽水机站的兴建工作，今年四月全部竣工。为了建筑这座抽水机站，国家派来技术人员，并先后贷款投资一亿八千四百二十万元。国营潞安煤矿发电厂的工人，帮助农民安装了电动机、抽水机和高压线。还修了一条长达一百六十公尺的干渠，四十公尺长的渡漕和二十多条分渠。每小时可抽水十五吨，浇地七亩半。至今已经浇地一千六百亩。当人们看到抽水机把河水引向农田的时候，都说：“农业要没有工业来支援，永远不能战胜自然灾害。”当地农民更高兴地说：“要不是工人老大哥帮助，做梦也想不到会用漳河的水浇地。”
