　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 30th: According to TASS, since the opening of the Geneva Conference, the movement of the French public to strive for an immediate end to the Vietnam War has further expanded. According to "L'Humanité," the Standing Committee of the Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Vietnam War passed a special resolution and sent it to French Foreign Minister Bidault. The resolution said: "The Geneva Conference should demand that the warring parties cease military operations in Indochina. If the French delegation acts in accordance with the interests of France, the Geneva Conference can facilitate a ceasefire in Indochina." The resolution hoped that the French representatives and representatives of the Ho Chi Minh government would establish contact for negotiations. The resolution called on all French people to hold rallies, send appeals, write letters, or send delegations to members of parliament, the government, and the French representatives in Geneva, demanding that the war not be internationalized and that military operations in Indochina cease.

　　Many parties, trade unions, and social organizations oppose the conspiracy to expand the Indochina conflict and advocate negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to peacefully resolve the Indochina War, including: the Seine Federation Committee of the Socialist Party, the participants of the Congress of the Former Prisoners of War Alliance of Seine-et-Marne, the Rhône Provincial Committee for the Defense of Peace, the Vaucluse Provincial Teachers' Congress, and other organizations.

　　The position of the French delegation attending the Geneva Conference has caused extreme unease among parliamentary figures. Daniel Mayer, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, said that he intends to go to Geneva to meet with Bidault. Mayer said: "The importance of the issues raised requires the National Assembly to fully understand the actual situation of this conference on Asian issues, other negotiations related to the situation in Indochina, and the prospects for peace resulting from these two activities. I am going to meet with the head of the French delegation in order to inform my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee." The Socialist Party Parliamentary Group of the National Assembly decided on April 28th to demand that a debate be launched immediately after the end of the National Assembly holiday on its interpellation regarding the situation in Indochina. Charles Lussy, Chairman of the Socialist Party Parliamentary Group, said that in this interpellation, the Socialist Party inquired of the government about "the nature of the instructions given to the Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding participation in the Geneva Conference, particularly in relation to the settlement of Asian issues and the cessation of hostilities in Indochina."

    法国公众要求停止越南战争的运动高涨
   【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎四月二十九日讯：日内瓦会议开幕后，法国公众争取立即停止越南战争的运动的规模更加扩大了。据“人道报”报道，争取和平解决越南战争委员会常务委员会通过了特别决议，并把这个决议送交法国外交部长皮杜尔。决议说：“日内瓦会议应该要求交战双方停止印度支那的军事行动。如果法国代表团按照法国的利益而行动，日内瓦会议就能促成印度支那的停战。”决议希望法国代表和胡志明政府的代表建立接触，以进行谈判。决议号召所有的法国人举行集会，向议员、政府和在日内瓦的法国代表发出呼吁书，写信或派代表团，要求防止使这个战争国际化，要求停止印度支那的军事行动。
    反对扩大印度支那冲突的阴谋并主张与越南民主共和国政府进行谈判以和平解决印度支那战争的有许多党派、工会和社会组织，其中有：社会党塞纳省委员会、塞纳与瓦斯省前战俘联盟代表大会的参加者、罗尼省保卫和平委员会、瓦克卢斯省教师大会及其他组织。
    出席日内瓦会议的法国代表团的立场引起了议会人士的极度不安。国民议会外交委员会主席丹尼埃·麦耶说，他打算去日内瓦会晤皮杜尔。麦耶说：“所提出的问题的重要性，要求国民议会充分了解关于亚洲问题的这个会议的实际情况，和有关印度支那局势的其他谈判以及由于这两个活动而产生的和平前途。我去会晤法国代表团团长，就是为了使外交委员会的同事们了解情况。”法国社会党国民议会党团四月二十八日决定要求：在国民议会假期结束以后立即就它所提关于印度支那局势的质询展开辩论。社会党议会党团主席夏尔·卢西说，在这个质询中，社会党询问政府关于“给外交部部长有关参加日内瓦会议的指示的性质，特别是在有关解决亚洲问题和停止印度支那战火这方面的。”
