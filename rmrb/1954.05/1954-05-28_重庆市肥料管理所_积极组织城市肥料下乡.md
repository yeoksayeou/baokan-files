Actively Organizes Urban Fertilizer to Go to the Countryside

The Chongqing Municipal Fertilizer Management Office actively organizes urban fertilizer to go to the countryside to support farmers' spring plowing and production. The office has now supplied 552,000-plus loads of human and animal waste and over 155,000 tons of miscellaneous fertilizer to the suburbs of Chongqing and to Ba County, Fuling, Changshou, and Jiangbei Counties in Sichuan Province. In addition to vigorously organizing the dispatch of manure from cities such as Chongqing to the countryside, the office also sends people to Rongchang, Longchang, and other county towns to purchase miscellaneous fertilizers such as chicken feathers, duck feathers, and plant ash. When supplying fertilizer, the office adopts the method of directly transporting the fertilizer to the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties and districts, and then the cooperatives uniformly supply it. This saves farmers the time and expense of going to the city to buy fertilizer, and also solves the problem that some farmers do not have long-distance manure transportation tools.

    重庆市肥料管理所
    积极组织城市肥料下乡
    重庆市肥料管理所积极组织城市肥料下乡，支持农民春耕生产。该所现已供应给重庆市郊区和四川省巴县、涪陵、长寿、江北等县人粪尿五十五万二千余挑，杂肥十五万五千多吨。该所除在重庆等市大力组织粪便下乡外，还派人到荣昌、隆昌等地县城采购鸡毛、鸭毛、草木灰等杂肥。在供应肥料时，该所采取了把肥料直接运到各县、区供销合作社，由合作社统一进行供应的办法，节省了农民进城购买肥料的时间和费用，同时解决了一部分农民没有长距离运粪工具的困难。（重庆市肥料管理所）
