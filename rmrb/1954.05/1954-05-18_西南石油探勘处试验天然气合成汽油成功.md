    Southwest Petroleum Exploration Bureau Successfully Experiments with Natural Gas to Synthesize Gasoline
    The Southwest Petroleum Exploration Bureau's experiment in synthesizing gasoline from natural gas was successful. At midnight on March 1st, the first tube of gasoline was obtained, yielding 60 to 70 cubic centimeters of liquid gasoline per cubic meter of natural gas. Synthesizing gasoline from natural gas involves complex processes such as desulfurization, cracking, and synthesis, but thanks to the support of the Party and the efforts of the workers, the experiment was finally successful. This is of great significance for utilizing Sichuan's abundant natural gas to develop transportation in the Southwest.

    西南石油探勘处试验天然气合成汽油成功
    西南石油探勘处天然气合成汽油试验成功。三月一日午夜，获得了第一管汽油，每立方公尺的天然气得液体汽油六十至七十公分。用天然气合成汽油，要经过脱硫、裂化、合成等复杂过程，但由于党的支持和职工们的努力，终于试验成功。这对利用四川丰富的天然气来发展西南交通具有重大作用。
