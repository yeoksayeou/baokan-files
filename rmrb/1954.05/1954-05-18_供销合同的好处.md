    The Benefits of Supply and Marketing Contracts

    After the Zunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the 14th District of Santai County, Sichuan Province expanded, it signed a supply and marketing contract with the district's supply and marketing cooperative in February of this year. Not only could plows, shares, hoes, harrows and other production tools be fully supplied on time, but the cooperative members, especially the female members, felt most deeply that they didn't even have to worry too much about daily necessities like oil and salt!

    Originally, a farmer's income for the year depended on two seasons of crops, and it was difficult to produce cash every month to buy oil and salt. When women had money, they would hold onto it tightly, saving it to buy oil and salt; when they didn't have money, they would sell grain by the liter or eggs by the five or ten. Often, the family would only have salt to eat every three to five days, and oil every ten or eight days. After the supply and marketing contract was signed, each month the cooperative only had to send a member to the supply and marketing cooperative to record an account, and they would bring back all the oil and salt needed by the entire cooperative. Each household could take as much as they needed, and the cooperative only had to keep a record of the account, and when the summer or autumn harvest season came, the debts would be deducted and paid off uniformly. Now, no cooperative member worries about these trivial matters of oil and salt anymore.

    供销合同的好处
    四川省三台县十四区尊胜农业生产合作社扩大以后，在今年二月跟区上的供销合作社订了供销合同，不光犁、铧、锄、耙等生产工具能够按时得到充分供应，社员们，特别是女社员们，体会最深的是：连油盐等生活用品也不用多操心了！
    原来农家的收入一年是靠两季庄稼，要月月拿出现钱称油买盐，比较为难。妇女们有了钱，就把钱抓得紧紧的，留着买油盐；没有钱，就要一升两升地卖粮食，五个十个地卖鸡蛋。常常弄得一家人三天五天吃回盐，十天八天吃回油。供销合同订立后，每个月只要由社里派社员到供销合作社记个账，就把全社需要的油盐挑回来了。哪家要吃多少就去领多少，全社只消记下账，等到夏收或是秋收时节，把欠债统一扣清还尽。现在，没有哪个社员还在为这些油盐琐事操心了。
