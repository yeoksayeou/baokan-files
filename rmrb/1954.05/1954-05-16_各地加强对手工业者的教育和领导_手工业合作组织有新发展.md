Various Localities Strengthen Education and Leadership for Handicraft Workers
Handicraft Cooperative Organizations See New Development

[By this Newspaper] Following the principle of “active leadership, steady progress,” various localities across the country are conscientiously carrying out the work of organizing handicraft workers. According to incomplete statistics from ten provinces, cities, and towns, including Hebei, Shanxi, Qinghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi'an, Dalian, and Linqing, 719 new handicraft production cooperatives, 58 supply and marketing production cooperatives, and 530 production teams were established in the first quarter of this year.

After the announcement of the general task for the country's transition period, 24 regions across major areas and provinces and cities nationwide convened handicraft work conferences to study the guidelines and specific measures for implementing socialist transformation of handicrafts in various localities. Many special districts and counties and cities summoned handicraft workers to meetings, publicizing the country's general task for the transition period, and conducting education on the path of cooperativization using practical examples. Some even carried out processing and ordering work at the meetings. More than 75% of counties and cities in Shanxi Province convened handicraft representative forums, with each county in the Yuncheng Special District generally holding two to three such meetings. In order to better implement the socialist transformation of handicrafts, Sichuan, Liaoxi, Jilin, Beijing, Chongqing, Changchun, and other provinces and cities began investigating the situation of handicraft industries, households, capital, production, and sales in the first quarter. To strengthen leadership over handicrafts, preparatory committees for joint federations of handicraft production cooperatives have been newly established in Anhui, Henan, Tianjin, Xi'an, Changchun, Yinchuan, and Xingtai, Handan, and Xuanhua in Hebei Province; the People's Governments of Hubei, Henan, and other provinces have established handicraft management organizations. Many regions have begun training handicraft cadres. The Southwest District plans to train 360 handicraft cadres, with 80 already trained in the first quarter. The Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a training class for handicraft activists within the municipal party school, with 66 students including Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members from among handicraft workers. The Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province and the Xuchang Special District in Henan Province have both held training classes for handicraft cadres.

After learning about the country's general task for the transition period, the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of handicraft workers have been greatly enhanced, and they have requested to organize and take the path of cooperativization. Statistics from Shanxi Province up to the end of March show that approximately 16,400 new handicraft workers have joined handicraft production cooperatives and production teams; the total number of organized handicraft workers in the province now accounts for more than 23% of the total handicraft labor force. In Linqing Town, Shandong Province, the number of organized handicraft workers has reached 51.5% of the total number of handicraft practitioners in the town. Many existing handicraft production cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production teams have also appropriately expanded their organizations. The ironworker and farm implement handicraft production cooperatives in Xining City, Qinghai Province, have added 24 new members.

Many handicraft production cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production teams have shown new characteristics such as increased production efficiency and improved product quality shortly after their establishment. For example, after organizing a production team this spring, the handicraft saddle makers in Zhangjiawan Village, Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, have doubled their production efficiency and significantly reduced product costs due to division of labor and technical improvements. After the establishment of the Xin County farm implement production cooperative in Shanxi Province, the quality of its products has increased by 20%, and the produced farm implements have enjoyed broad sales.

    各地加强对手工业者的教育和领导
    手工业合作组织有新发展
    【本报讯】全国各地根据“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，认真进行组织手工业者的工作。据河北、山西、青海、北京、天津、上海、重庆、西安、旅大、临清等十个省、市、镇的不完全统计，在今年第一季度，已新建立手工业生产合作社七百一十九个、供销生产社五十八个、生产小组五百三十个。
    在国家过渡时期的总任务公布以后，全国各大区及省、市已有二十四个地区召开了手工业工作会议，研究了各地对手工业实行社会主义改造的方针和具体措施。许多专区和县、市都召集手工业者开会，宣传了国家在过渡时期的总任务，用实际事例进行了走合作化道路的教育，有的并在会议上进行了组织加工、订货的工作。山西省百分之七十五以上的县、市都召开了手工业代表座谈会，运城专区各县一般都召开了两次到三次。为了更好地对手工业者实行社会主义改造，四川、辽西、吉林、北京、重庆、长春等省、市，在第一季度中着手调查了手工业行业、户数、资金、产销等情况。为了加强对手工业的领导，安徽、河南、天津、西安、长春、银川和河北省的邢台、邯郸、宣化等地，都新成立了手工业生产合作社联合社筹备委员会；湖北、河南等省人民政府成立了手工业管理机构。许多地区已着手训练手工业干部。西南区计划训练手工业干部三百六十人，第一季度已训练了八十人。中共福州市委会在市委党校内举办了手工业积极分子训练班，学员中有手工业工人中的共产党员、青年团员等，共六十六人。山西省长治专区、河南省许昌专区都举办了手工业干部训练班。
    广大手工业者了解了国家在过渡时期的总任务以后，政治觉悟和生产积极性大为提高，纷纷要求组织起来走合作化的道路。山西省到三月底的统计，新参加手工业生产合作社和生产小组的手工业者，共约有一万六千四百人；全省组织起来的手工业者，已占手工业劳动者总数的百分之二十三强。山东省临清镇组织起来的手工业者，已达全镇手工业从业人员的百分之五十一点五。许多原有的手工业生产合作社、供销生产社和生产小组也适当地扩大了组织。青海省西宁市铁工和农具两个手工业生产合作社，即增加了二十四名新社员。
    许多手工业生产合作社、供销生产社、生产小组成立不久，就出现了生产效率提高、产品质量改进等新气象。如甘肃省广通回族自治区张家湾村的手工制鞍工人，在今春组织生产小组以后，由于分工合作和改进技术，生产效率提高了一倍，产品成本也降低不少。山西省忻县农具生产合作社成立以后，产品的质量已提高了百分之二十，生产出来的农具有了广阔的销路。
