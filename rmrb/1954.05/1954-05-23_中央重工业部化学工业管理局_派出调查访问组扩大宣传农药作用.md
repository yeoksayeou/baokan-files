    Central Heavy Industry Department Chemical Industry Administration
    Sends Investigation and Visitation Groups to Expand Promotion of Pesticide Effects
    In order to support farmers in developing production, the Chemical Industry Administration of the Central Heavy Industry Department has produced large quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in recent years. Taking 1949 as 100, the output of chemical fertilizers in 1953 reached 753, and pesticides reached 1313. Now, chemical fertilizers have been adopted by the majority of farmers, but many farmers are not accustomed to using pesticides. In order to help farmers effectively use pesticides, the bureau sent two investigation and visitation groups in late February this year, carrying ten tons each of wettable and powder "666", as well as instructions, publicity materials, etc., and 1,100 letters written in the name of all employees of the bureau, to North China, East China, and Central South China to visit state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and agricultural labor models. According to the size and pest situation of each unit, they gave away 50 to 250 catties of pesticides respectively.
    The investigation and visitation groups of the bureau were warmly welcomed by the farmers when they arrived in each region. Recently, the bureau has received more than 60 letters from agricultural production cooperatives and other units in various regions, reflecting the good effects of using "666" pesticides, and requesting the bureau to produce more chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order to increase agricultural production and support national economic construction. The Liu Wanzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaoliudian received the pesticides donated by the Chemical Industry Administration just as red spiders and wheat leaf bees were harming wheat seedlings, and the members felt infinitely excited. They swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to guarantee hard work in production and strive for a good harvest. Labor model Zhang Qinglan said: "The worker brothers personally delivered the pesticides, we are very happy; I guarantee to lead the second team to do a good job in checking seedlings and replanting, not leaving an inch of land idle, and strive for a bumper cotton harvest." The Li Shunda Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, a winner of the Gold Star Medal, also presented the Chemical Industry Administration with a banner, which read: "Under the illumination of the general task of the state during the transition period, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance."

    中央重工业部化学工业管理局
    派出调查访问组扩大宣传农药作用
    中央重工业部化学工业管理局为支援农民发展生产，近几年来大量生产了化学肥料和农药。如以一九四九年为一百，一九五三年化学肥料的产量已达到七百五十三，农药达一千三百一十三。现在，化学肥料已为广大农民采用，但许多农民还不习惯使用农药。为了帮助农民有效地使用农药，该局在今年二月下旬派出两个调查访问小组，携带可湿性和粉剂“六六六”各十吨，以及说明书、宣传品等，还有以全局职工名义写的一千一百封信，分赴华北、华东、中南各地，访问国营农场、农业生产合作社以及农业劳动模范，并根据各单位的大小和虫害情况，分别赠给农药五十斤到二百五十斤。
    该局调查访问组到达每一地区，都受到了农民的热烈欢迎。最近该局收到了各地农业生产合作社等的来信六十多封，信上反映了使用“六六六”农药的良好效果，并要求该局多多生产化学肥料、农药，以便增产农产品支援国家经济建设。小柳店刘万桢农业生产合作社，正当红蜘蛛、麦叶蜂等危害小麦幼苗时，接到了化学工业管理局赠送给该社的农药，社员们感到无限兴奋。他们在毛主席像前宣誓，保证努力生产，争取丰收。劳动模范张庆兰说：“工人老大哥亲手把农药送来，我们高兴极了；我保证带动第二队做好查苗补苗工作，不闲一寸地，争取棉花丰收。”金星奖章获得者李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社还赠给化学工业管理局锦旗一面，上边写着：“在国家过渡时期总任务照耀下，进一步巩固工农联盟”。
