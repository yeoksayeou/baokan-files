Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 5th: According to TASS, the French cabinet held a meeting on the 3rd to discuss issues regarding the parliamentary session scheduled to open on the 4th. Because the secretariat of the National Assembly had received numerous inquiries from deputies of various parties regarding the situation in Indochina, the chairman of the Socialist parliamentary group, Lucet, said that he was prepared to again ask the National Assembly to discuss this issue.

From newspaper reports, it can be seen that the cabinet meeting discussed how the government should deal with these inquiries. Reports say that the government passed a resolution requesting an indefinite postponement of replying to the above inquiries, using the excuse that it was impossible to discuss the Indochina issue during the Geneva Conference, which is equivalent to rejecting these inquiries.

"L'Humanité" wrote: "The government wants to evade debate... but the mood of the deputies is increasingly high, and most of them may demand an immediate discussion of these inquiries." Indicative of the unease of most deputies is that the chairman of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, Mayer, has already gone to Geneva to meet with the head of the French delegation, Bidault. Mayer is to report on the results of his talks with Bidault at a meeting of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee on the 6th.

Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: Paris dispatch: Many deputies from various French parties immediately questioned the French government's attitude on the Indochina issue at the resumed French National Assembly on May 4th, and demanded negotiations to quickly achieve a ceasefire. As the French National Assembly resumed its session on the 4th, the political atmosphere in Paris, as described by Reuters reporter Harold King, was one of "widespread concern that Bidault (French Foreign Minister) is colluding with the U.S. government to involve the United States in the war." According to Agence France-Presse, the deputies who returned to Paris from various constituencies were also in a tense mood due to the anxiety of their constituents about the development of the situation. In the five weeks of the National Assembly recess, nine inquiries concerning the Indochina situation had already been raised. A meeting of party leaders agreed to recommend immediately setting a date for debating these inquiries. However, French Prime Minister Laniel insisted on postponing the debate until after the Geneva Conference and determining the date of the debate by the French government.

At the meeting on the 4th, Champetier de Ribes, a deputy of the Progressive Republican Union, first raised the inquiry. He warned against American intervention in the Indochina war, pointing out that some members of the French government were still hoping for American intervention. He said that France should not let the opportunity provided by the Geneva Conference pass in vain. He demanded a ceasefire and the conclusion of peace in Indochina.

Socialist Deputy Lucet then spoke, demanding that ceasefire negotiations be held without unacceptable preconditions. He criticized the government's suggestion to postpone the debate until after the Geneva Conference, because these inquiries were related to the instructions and powers given to the French representatives attending the Geneva Conference. He said that if the government could not resolve the differences of opinion within the cabinet itself on the Indochina situation, then the National Assembly should hold a debate as soon as possible.

Denis, a former member of the Popular Republican Party and now an independent deputy, demanded an immediate debate. He demanded full knowledge of all the demands Bidault had made to Dulles. He wanted to know the government's intentions: whether its policy was to internationalize the war or to negotiate.

Vallon, a former Gaullist and now an independent deputy, condemned the French government, especially Foreign Minister Bidault, for demanding American armed intervention in Indochina. Vallon demanded a ceasefire.

Communist Deputy Gasanova condemned the French government's attitude towards the Geneva Conference and demanded an immediate cessation of fighting. He pointed out: "The policy of relying on force and using force for blackmail is failing."

Independent Farmer Party Deputy Badouin said that the start of peace negotiations implied a ceasefire. He expressed incomprehension as to why the French government had not requested a study of the ceasefire issue at the beginning of the Geneva Conference.

Radical Socialist and former Prime Minister Daladier also insisted in his speech that a ceasefire should be reached in a timely manner.

Although subjected to universal criticism from deputies of various parties, Laniel did not change the obstructive attitude he had adopted during the National Assembly debate on the Indochina issue in March. He insisted on postponing the discussion of the Indochina issue and pushing the debate date to a later time to be determined. He even threatened the National Assembly with a vote of confidence on the postponement of the debate. He used the excuse that he did not want to "affect the Geneva Conference and delay the armistice," but French figures believe that this was actually to avoid the National Assembly questioning the French government's attitude of following the United States.

    法国各党派议员要求在印度支那实现停火
    拉尼埃采取阻挠态度坚持延期讨论印度支那问题
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国内阁在三日举行会议，讨论关于订于四日开幕的议会会议问题。因为国民议会秘书处收到了各党派议员关于印度支那局势的许多质询，社会党议会党团主席卢西说，他准备再要求国民议会讨论这个问题。
    从报纸消息中可以看出，内阁会议曾经讨论了政府应如何对付这些质询的问题。各报说，政府通过了决议，要求不定期地延期答复上述质询，借口在日内瓦会议期间不可能讨论印度支那问题，这就等于拒绝了这些质询。
      “义勇军报”写道：“政府想逃避辩论……而议员们情绪日益高昂，大多数人可能会要求立即讨论这些质询。”足以表明大部分议员的不安情绪的是：国民议会外交委员会主席麦耶已经去日内瓦会见法国代表团团长皮杜尔。麦耶要在六日在国民议会外交委员会会议上报告和皮杜尔会谈的结果。
      【新华社六日讯】巴黎消息：法国各党派的许多议员在五月四日复会的法国国民议会上，立即对法国政府在印度支那问题上的态度提出质询，并要求进行谈判，迅速实现停火。在法国国民议会复会时，巴黎的政治气氛如路透社记者哈罗德·金所说，是“普遍担心皮杜尔（法国外交部长）与美国政府串通一气使美国参加战争”。据法新社说，从各地选区回到巴黎的议员们由于他们的选民对于局势的发展感到不安，情绪也很紧张。在国民议会休假的五个星期中，就已经有九项关于印度支那局势的质询案提出。各政党领袖会议同意建议立即规定对这些质询案进行辩论的日期。但是，法国政府总理拉尼埃却主张，把辩论推延到日内瓦会议结束后举行，并由法国政府确定辩论日期。
    在四日会议上，进步共和联盟议员德香布兰首先提出质询。他警告不要让美国干涉印度支那战争，他指出，法国政府某些阁员仍然盼望美国的干涉。他说，法国不应该让日内瓦会议提供的机会白白过去。他要求在印度支那实现停火和缔结和平。
    社会党议员卢西接着发言，他要求在没有不能接受的先决条件下举行停战谈判。他指责政府建议把辩论延到日内瓦会议结束后举行的主张，因为这些质询案与给予法国出席日内瓦会议的代表们的指示及权力有关。他说，如果政府不能解决内阁本身对印度支那局势的意见分歧，那么国民议会就应该尽速举行辩论。
    前属人民共和党议员，现在没有党派关系的议员德尼要求立即举行辩论。他要求充分知道皮杜尔向杜勒斯提出的要求的全部内容。他希望知道政府的意图如何，它的政策是使战争国际化呢，还是进行谈判。
    前属戴高乐派、现为无党派人士的议员伐隆斥责法国政府，特别是外交部长皮杜尔，因为他们要求美国武装干涉印度支那。伐隆要求实行停火。
    共产党议员加桑诺瓦谴责法国政府对日内瓦会议的态度，并要求立即停止战斗。他指出：“依靠武力和通过武力来进行讹诈的政策正在失败。”
    独立农民党议员巴杜说，和平谈判的展开隐含着实行停火的意思。他表示不懂法国政府为什么没有在日内瓦会议一开始的时候要求研究一下停火问题。
    激进社会党人、前总理达拉第在发言中也坚持应及时达成停火。
    虽然受到各党派议员们的普遍抨击，拉尼埃仍旧没有改变他在三月份国民议会辩论印度支那问题时就采取的阻挠态度。他坚持主张延期讨论印度支那问题，把辩论日期推到以后再确定。他并且提出对延期辩论一事举行信任投票来要挟国民议会。他借口这是因为不希望“影响日内瓦会议与推迟停战”，然而，法国人士认为，实际上这是为了要躲避国民议会去过问法国政府追随美国的态度。
