Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 20th: Since the Geneva Conference began discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina, the living room of the Chinese delegation has frequently been filled with representatives of people's organizations or residents from various parts of France. They represent a wide range of French people and express to the Chinese delegation their sincere desire to stop the Indochina War and restore peace in Indochina.

From May 11th to 19th, the Chinese delegation continued to meet with 32 delegations. They came from all over France, including representatives of national organizations, local organizations, and some representatives elected by residents at temporary gatherings. Among the representatives were workers from various industries such as steel, metallurgy, gas, electricity, mining, textiles, railways, and transportation, as well as university professors, engineers, doctors, pharmacists, journal editors, trade union workers, social activists, industrialists, provincial and municipal councilors, administrative officials, athletes, women, youth, students, Catholics, and families of the French Expeditionary Force. They represented the opinions of French people from different strata, different professions, different beliefs, and different parties. On the Indochina issue, they demanded an immediate end to the "dirty war" that had impoverished the people and drained the country for the past eight years.

Each delegation brought resolutions or statements of opinion from local people's organizations or residents. These resolutions or statements of opinion unanimously demanded that the Indochina War be stopped and peace in Indochina be restored through negotiation. The resolution of the residents of the Valdonne mining area stated: "When the embers of the last World War have not yet been extinguished, the Indochina War threatens to trigger a third World War, and this war is only sacrificing the happiness of the vast majority of people for the benefit of a few." The resolution of the Marseille electrical and coal workers stated that the continuation of the Indochina War "sees no good prospects other than the loss of life and economic losses." The opinion of the residents of Ivry, a suburb of Paris, stated: "The Indochina War has cost our district the lives of eighteen citizens, and the tragedy of Dien Bien Phu has further highlighted this situation." The petition of the railway workers of Saint-Georges-de-Neuvelles stated: "We are deeply aware that our vital interests are linked to the cessation of the Indochina War and the reduction of military spending. When this war stops, the military budget can be reduced by hundreds of billions each year."

These resolutions or statements of opinion also criticized the French government's policies. The letter from the representatives of Carcassonne in the Aude department to Bidault stated: "French soldiers are unwilling to be mercenaries for foreigners." The letter from the Vitry Peace Committee on the Seine to the Geneva Conference stated: "The French delegation attending the Geneva Conference does not truly represent France, but only represents Mr. Bidault's policies."

Many resolutions or statements of opinion supported the proposals of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The letter from the French Women's Union in Marseille stated: "The women of Marseille already know about Mr. Pham Van Dong's proposals. These proposals in themselves contain the hope of a ceasefire and the possibility of negotiations with respect for the interests of France and peace. The women of Marseille must make all women aware of these proposals. We will work with our parliamentarians and the government so that France firmly embarks on the path of consultation to seek the greatest welfare of the two peoples."

The delegations expressed respect for the Chinese people's peaceful construction, their efforts to defend world peace, and China's contribution to international affairs. They were excited about the Chinese delegation's sympathy and support for the French people's desire for peace. (Attached picture)

    我国代表团继续接见法国各地人民代表
    【新华社日内瓦二十日电】自从日内瓦会议开始讨论恢复印度支那和平问题以来，中国代表团的客厅里经常坐满来自法国各地的人民团体或居民代表。他们代表广泛阶层的法国人民，向中国代表团申述他们迫切要求停止印度支那战争和恢复印度支那和平的真诚愿望。
    从五月十一日到十九日的九天中，中国代表团继续接见了三十二批代表团。他们来自法国各地，其中有全国性组织的代表，也有地方组织的代表，还有一些是居民在临时集会上推选出来的代表。代表中有钢铁、冶金、煤气、电业、矿山、纺织、铁路、搬运等各业工人，有大学教授、工程师、医师、药剂师、期刊编辑，有工会工作者、社会活动家，有工业家、省市议员及行政官吏，有运动员，有妇女、青年、学生，有天主教徒，还有法国远征军的家属等。他们代表着不同阶层、不同职业、不同信仰、不同党派的法国人民的意见。他们在印度支那问题上要求立即停止八年来弄得民穷财尽的“肮脏战争”。
    每一个代表团都带有当地人民团体或居民们的决议或意见书。这些决议或意见书中一致要求通过协商办法停止印度支那战争和恢复印度支那和平。瓦尔多纳矿区居民的决议书中说：“当最近一次世界大战的废墟余烬未熄时，印度支那战争又有使第三次世界大战爆发的危险，而这个战争仅仅是为了少数人的利益而牺牲广大人民的幸福。”马赛电气和煤业工人的决议书中说，印度支那战争继续下去，“除去生命和经济的损失外看不见任何好的前途”。巴黎近郊伊弗里区居民的意见书中说：“印度支那战争使我们一个区就牺牲了十八个公民，奠边府的悲剧更加显示这种情况。”圣乔治新村铁路工人的请愿书中说：“我们深知我们的切身利益和停止印度支那战争及减低军费预算相联系。这一战争停止了，军费预算每年将可减少几千亿。”
    这些决议或意见书中也指责了法国政府的政策。奥德省卡卡松市代表给皮杜尔的信中说：“法国军队不愿做外国人的雇佣兵。”塞纳河上的维特里和平委员会致日内瓦会议的信中说：“出席日内瓦会议的法国代表团并不能真正代表法国，而只是代表皮杜尔先生的政策。”
    许多决议或意见书支持越南民主共和国代表团的建议。马赛法兰西妇女联盟的信中说：“马赛妇女已经知道范文同先生的建议。这些建议本身就包含着停火的希望和在尊重法国及和平的利益的情况下进行谈判的可能性。马赛妇女一定要使得所有妇女都知道这些建议。我们将向我们的议员和政府进行工作，以便法国坚决地走上协商的道路，求得两国人民的最大福利。”
    各代表团对于中国人民的和平建设、为保卫世界和平的努力以及中国在国际事务中的贡献，都表示敬意。他们对中国代表团同情和支持法国人民的和平愿望，感到兴奋。（附图片）
