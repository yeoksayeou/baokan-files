    We Have Great Prospects
    Ma. Nabotova, Tenth Grade Student of the "Aini" Tenth Girls' Middle School in Stalinabad, Soviet Union, Member of the Lenin Communist Youth League, Excellent Student.
    I often hear elderly Tajiks talk about their past lives, how they were oppressed, begging for a living, and constantly living in fear. The tyranny of the local emperors and big landlords was lawless.
    Indeed, our people here were not living then, but eking out a miserable existence, destined only to die. The situation of Tajik women was even more tragic. They were complete slaves, with no rights whatsoever.
    If you compare the present life of the Tajiks with the past, it is as different as day and night. The dark days of the Tajiks are gone forever. Now, we live freely and happily, without poverty, and women and men enjoy the same broad rights. As for culture, it is truly a tremendous leap from darkness to light. The fact is that before the Great October Revolution, there was not a single school for the people in Tajikistan, and people lived in terrible ignorance. At that time, only one in two hundred people here could read, and that person was either a priest, a landlord, or an official. But now, almost every village in Tajikistan has a school. We study in our own language, with our own textbooks, and read masterpieces of Russian and world literature published in our own language.
    Before the revolution, not a single Tajik had received higher education, but now there are thousands of people with higher education, and Tajik universities train hundreds of specialists of various kinds every year. The number of scientists, writers, agronomists, educators, and doctors is constantly increasing.
    A broad road of life unfolds before the young men and women of our Tajikistan. If you want to study there, you can choose any school and any major. This is not a dream, but a true fact. In three months, we tenth-grade girls will take the national examination and receive our graduation certificates. We have no students with poor grades, and we will all graduate. We also want to continue our studies. There are thirty-three girls in our school who will complete the tenth-grade course this year, and everyone plans to go to university.
    What will we do in the future? Needless to say, all professions in our country are good and glorious. But everyone has their favorite profession, the one they plan to dedicate their life to. We have each chosen a major for ourselves in advance. My good friends, Sainab Hashanova and Matlab Umarova, and myself have decided to continue our studies at Tajik State University. We love exact sciences, so we have chosen the Department of Mathematics and Physics, and plan to become mathematics teachers in the future. Raisa Hamidova and Taskila Nabiulina plan to become biologists. Hosiyat Karimova and Asya Davydova want to be surgeons. Ainiso Akramova has always hoped to be an engineer.
    The future will be like this. I believe our hopes will be realized. Life itself convinces me of this every day.
    Raisa Mirzokandova, a female student trained by our school, has successfully graduated from Tajik University and become a biologist, which is exactly what she expected when she was in school. Now she teaches biology and leads the teaching and research department at Kulyab Normal College. Shairigul Nazarova, a graduate of our school, has graduated from university and is working in the research institute. As she wished, she has become a scientific worker.
    Bashira Shakhopova aspired to attend Moscow Lomonosov University, and now she is studying there. Sayora Isayeva wants to be an architect and is now a student at the Leningrad Institute of Architecture.
    The Tajiks are free and fully entitled citizens of the great Soviet country, and a broad road to wisdom and light is unfolding before them—how can we not be proud of this! The Party, the government, and the great Russian people have freed us from days full of misfortune and tears and led us onto the sunny road of freedom and happiness—how can we not be grateful to them!
    The Soviet motherland cares for and nurtures us young people like a mother, teaching us with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, with the spirit of humanism and respect for all the people of the world. It has cultivated us into lively, cheerful, vigorous people who are full of confidence in the future and love life and labor. In our country, people are the most precious, and the state is always concerned about the fate of people.
    My life is a good example. I grew up in Karakgin, a mountainous area of the Tovili-Dauling district. At the age of six, I lost both my parents, leaving me and my little brother, who was only one year old, with no other relatives. In any capitalist country, such an experience would only lead to death, but the Soviet motherland took great care of us: we entered kindergarten, and everything was provided by the state. Now I am eighteen years old, and I will go to university after graduating from middle school. My brother is studying in the fifth grade of a boarding school.
    Such examples are not unique. Dozens of orphans live and study in our school, and the state guarantees their lives.
    For our great life prospects, for our wonderful present and happy tomorrow, for all this, we love our motherland so much, love our dear motherland, and sincerely thank the Party and the government. When each of us leaves school and embarks on the road of labor life, we will repay the motherland, the Party, and the people with our work, because they are so good to us.

    我们有远大的前程
    苏联斯大林纳巴德“爱尼娅”第十女子中学十年级学生  列宁共产主义青年团团员、优等生  玛·纳波托娃
    常听到塔吉克的老年人谈起他们过去的生活，说他们是如何受人欺压，乞讨度日，经常提心吊胆。土皇帝和大地主的专横暴虐是无法无天的。
    的确，我们这里的老百姓那时不是在生活，而是苟延残喘，注定只有死路一条。塔吉克妇女的境遇更加悲惨。她们是十足的奴婢，毫无权利可言。
    如果拿塔吉克人现在的生活和过去相比，就像白天和黑夜一样的迥然不同。塔吉克人从前黯无天日的时光已一去不返。现在，我们生活得自由、欢乐，没有贫困，妇女和男子同样享有广泛的权利。至于文化，真是从黑暗到光明的巨大飞跃。事实是，在伟大十月革命以前，塔吉克斯坦境内还没有一所为人民设立的学校，人们生活在可怕的愚昧里。那时我们这里两百个人中只有一个人识字，而这个识字的不是神甫、就是地主或官吏。然而现在，塔吉克斯坦几乎每个村庄都有学校。我们用本民族的语言、本国的课本学习，读着用本民族语言出版的俄国和世界文学名著。
    革命以前，没有一个塔吉克人受过高等教育，而现在受过高等教育的人是数以千计的，每年塔吉克的高等学校都培养出数百名各种专家。科学家、作家、农艺学家、教育家、医师的人数不断增加。
    在我们塔吉克斯坦男女青年的面前展开了广阔的生活的道路。你愿意到那儿学习，你就可以选择任何一个学校，选择任何一种专业。这不是梦想，而是真情实事。再过三个月，我们十年级的女学生就要通过国家考试得到毕业证书。我们没有成绩不良的学生，我们全都会毕业。我们还想继续求学。我们学校里有三十三个女孩子将在今年修完十年级课程，大家都打算进大学。
    我们将来要做什么呢？不消说，我国所有的职业都是好的、光荣的。但每人有她最喜爱的、打算为它献出自己的一生的一种职业。我们每个人都已为自己预先选定了一种专业。我的好朋友赛纳布·哈莎诺娃和玛特拉布·乌玛罗娃以及我自己都决定进塔吉克国立大学继续求学。我们爱好精确科学，因此我们选择了数理系，将来准备当数学教员。拉伊莎·哈米多娃和塔斯基拉·纳比乌丽娜打算当生物学家。荷西雅特·卡里莫娃和阿丝雅·达维多娃要作外科医生。阿伊尼索·阿克拉莫娃一直希望做个工程师。
    将来会是这样的。我相信我们的希望都会实现。生活本身每天都使我确信这一点。
    我们学校培养出来的女学生拉伊莎·米尔佐坎多娃已经顺利地读完了塔吉克大学，成了生物学家，这正是她在学校时所期望的。现在她在库里雅布师范学院讲授生物学并领导教研室。从我们学校毕业的莎伊里古尔·纳萨罗娃已经大学毕业在研究院工作，她如愿以偿，成了科学工作者。
    巴希拉·沙霍波娃曾立志上莫斯科罗蒙诺索夫大学，现在她就在那儿学习。赛约拉·伊莎耶娃要当建筑师，现在她是列宁格勒建筑学院的学生。
    塔吉克人是伟大苏维埃国家的自由的、享有充分权利的公民，他们面前展开着走向智慧和光明的广阔道路——我们怎能不为此而自豪呢！党、政府和伟大的俄罗斯人民使我们摆脱了充满不幸和眼泪的日子，走上了阳光普照的自由幸福的大道——我们怎能不为此而感激他们呢！
    苏维埃祖国像母亲一样地关心和抚育我们青年人，用无产阶级的国际主义精神，用人道主义和尊重世界全体人民的精神教导我们。它把我们培养成活泼愉快的、朝气蓬勃的、对明天充满信心、热爱生活和劳动的人。在我们的国家里，人是最宝贵的，国家时刻关心着人的命运。
    我的生活就是很好的例子。我生长在多山的托维里——道陵区的卡拉克金。在六岁时我失去了双亲，留下我和仅有一岁的小弟弟，此外没有一个亲人。像我们这样的遭遇，要是在任何一个资本主义国家里，那就只能是死路一条，然而，苏维埃祖国对我们照顾得很周到：我们进了幼儿园，一切全由国家供给。现在我已经十八岁，中学毕业后我还要上大学。我的弟弟在寄宿学校五年级学习。
    这样的例子并不是唯一的。有几十个孤儿在我们学校寄宿和学习，国家保证他们的生活。
    为了我们有远大的生活前程，为了我们有美好的今天和欢乐的明天，为了这一切，我们是这样热爱祖国，热爱亲爱的祖国，衷心感谢党和政府。当我们每个人走出学校踏上劳动生活的道路时，我们要用工作来报答祖国、党和人民，因为它们对我们是那样好。
