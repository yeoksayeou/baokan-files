    Utilizing Barren Hills and Empty Land to Plant Grains, Fruits, and Vegetables

    Turning Barren Islands into Fertile Fields
    In Zengjia Village, Caifeng Township, Yongan County, Jiangxi Province, there was a barren island covered in thorns and grass over three feet tall, which had never been cultivated. This spring, Huang Rido, the mutual aid team leader, returned from attending the county's Third Labor Model Conference. He shared what he had learned at the meeting, urging everyone to find ways to increase grain production. The team members suggested reclaiming the barren island and turning it into fertile fields.
    Huang Rido agreed with their idea and led twenty-five team members to start reclaiming the land at dawn. After three days of hard work, they finally transformed the barren island into fertile fields, estimated to yield over 1,200 jin of grain annually.
      Sweet Potatoes "Go Up the Mountain"
    Shangyou Village is a small mountain village in Minhou County, Fujian Province. As the saying goes, "Rely on the mountain for food and nurture the mountain." However, a good hillside behind the village had been left barren.
    The villagers had long wanted to go up the mountain to cultivate and plant sweet potatoes, but they were afraid of wild boars stealing their crops. In February of this year, an agricultural production cooperative was established in the village. Chen Yiming, the Party branch secretary, also joined the cooperative. He thought:
  "With more people and greater strength in the agricultural cooperative, we can go up the mountain to reclaim land and plant large areas of sweet potatoes, increasing our grain production. Furthermore, with more people in the cooperative, we can build a shed on the mountain and assign someone to guard it, so we won't have to worry about wild boars anymore." He proposed the idea of going up the mountain to reclaim land and plant sweet potatoes at the cooperative. This was exactly what the members had been hoping for, and everyone unanimously agreed.
      One day, under a drizzling, overcast sky, the cooperative members happily went up the mountain to reclaim land. Using thirty-five workdays, they created a sweet potato garden large enough to plant 7,000 sweet potato seedlings. They were confident that in the near future, all the sweet potatoes could be planted on the mountain, allowing them to convert all the good fields to rice cultivation.
      Dry Slope Land Turns into a Vegetable Garden
    In Xijia Gully, Zhenyuan County, Gansu Province, there was an uneven dry slope land that was often eroded by mountain streams. Last year, farmer Zhang Tingkui built a wall over four feet high along the lower edge of the slope and created many raised beds based on the original terrain. He then built small dams in the ditches to raise the water level and dug small channels to bring the water to the land. This land was steeper than ordinary vegetable gardens, so to prevent the rapid flow from damaging the beds, he also dug a small storage pond at the entrance of the garden, first letting the water into the pond and then channeling it into the ground. This not only slowed the water flow but also allowed for water storage. On the mountainside adjacent to the vegetable garden, he built earthen embankments over two feet high, which not only blocked mountain floods but also conserved soil and water. Last year, the income from planting vegetables on these two mu of land more than doubled compared to the past. To strive for a bumper harvest, Zhang Tingkui is further transforming the slope land to turn it into flat paddy fields.
      Planting Melons and Vegetables Along Roadsides and Pondsides
    The Third Production Team of the Xiaoying Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tuanjie Township, Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, cultivated the soil along fields, roadsides, pondsides, and gravesides, planting a total of 145 gourds, 550 cucumbers, 710 corn plants, and 700 sunflowers. Last year, cooperative member Lu Xiaogang planted fourteen gourds along the field and harvested 112 gourds, saving a considerable amount of grain. This year, he decided to plant twenty gourds. Everyone calculated that if all thirteen households in the team cultivated the melons, vegetables, and other crops well, they could save 960 jin of rice.
      Transforming Barren Mountains and Gullies into Orchards
    Beizhen County, Liaoxi Province, is a mountainous area. In the spring and autumn of last year, the county planted a total of over 122,000 apple trees. This spring, they plan to plant another 55,000 apple trees and 500 grapevines. When this news spread to the villages, the farmers raised the slogan "We must turn barren mountains and gullies into orchards!" The fruit tree production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are all competing to plant more. One village, Xiaochangtun in the First District, plans to plant 5,200 trees. Many cadres have been dispatched to the countryside to help farmers solve technical problems related to planting. Planting has been widely underway since April 10th.
      Planting Oil Tea on Barren Mountains
    People in Yixing, Dantu, Lishui, Jurong, Liyang, and other counties in Jiangsu Province are utilizing barren mountain land to expand the cultivation of oil crops – oil tea. The oil tea tree is a perennial evergreen shrub that begins to flower and bear fruit about seven or eight years after planting, with each mu of tea seeds producing 90 jin of pure oil annually. Therefore, the oil tea tree is not only a good oil crop, but it can also conserve soil and water and prevent mountain floods. This spring, the Zhenjiang State-owned Siyi Farm planted over 500 mu using the gaps between tung oil trees and pine forests. The Yixing County Forest Farm conducted direct planting trials on the barren slopes of Hao Mountain. The Wang Qianhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiupin Township, Dantu County, and the Wei Daxi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingshan Township, Shangdang District, expanded their planting of oil tea trees on 45 mu of mountain land. It is estimated that this spring, the mountainous areas of the Zhenjiang Special District will plant 1,000 mu of oil tea trees. This autumn, the Zhenjiang and Suzhou Special Districts will mobilize the masses in mountainous areas to expand the planting of oil tea, and the Xuzhou Special District and mountainous areas such as Guanyun County will systematically expand the planting of walnut oil trees.
      Plant More Sesame, Produce More Oil
    Deng Fuben, the head of the Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dengfan Township, Dawu County, Hubei Province, was discussing with the cooperative members how to increase the production of oil crops one day. A member suggested that if they reclaimed the barren land across the river and planted sesame, it would not only increase oil crop production but also increase the income of the members. Everyone thought this was a great idea. Early the next morning, Deng Fuben led all the cooperative members to reclaim the land, and in three days, they had reclaimed all sixteen mu of land. The cooperative then revised its plan, deciding to plant all sixteen mu with sesame, expanding the area of oil crops by four times compared to last year.
    Seeing the cooperative reclaiming land to plant sesame, the Deng Anyi Mutual Aid Team in the same township also plans to reclaim three mu of barren land and expand the planting of sesame by two mu.
      Transforming Barren Wasteland into a Beautiful Mulberry Garden
    When the Gujiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, was established, Shen Wenjun, the director of the preparatory committee, suggested: "Let's reclaim the twenty mu of barren wasteland at the entrance of the village and plant lake mulberry trees. In three to five years, we can raise silkworms, wouldn't that be great!"
    This suggestion was quickly approved by everyone, and over a hundred people were organized to engage in collective labor. Young women swung their mattocks, turning over the wasteland covered with weeds, picking up the roots of the grass and stuffing them into the baskets next to them. The old men with gray hair also seemed younger, spitting on their palms, rubbing them together, and raising their mattocks, saying, "Young men, come on! See if this old man can do it!" Before the sun had set, they had loosened the soil on twenty mu of land and cleared the weeds completely.
      A barren field has already been transformed into fertile land, and in a few years, it will become a beautiful mulberry garden.
      Turning Bad Land into Good Land, Increasing Grain Production by Twenty Shi
    The Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangshufang Village, Eleventh District, Xinjin County, Liaodong Province, has over twenty mu of land that consists of sandy mounds, low-lying areas, and stony ground. The cotton fields on the northern mountain are unevenly sown every year due to being covered in rocks, so all the rocks must be picked out. The ridges of several plots in the eastern wasteland are too short to turn around at the end of the rows, so the ditches must be filled in and connected to create long rows in order to expand the cultivated area. Sixteen mu of waterlogged low-lying land need to be filled with 2,500 piles of mud. After these land improvements, grain production can be increased by at least twenty shi. In addition, four mu of the eight mu of vegetable garden are sandy mounds, which are not drought-resistant, so the sand needs to be dug out and replaced with good soil.
    In order to increase production, the cooperative called on everyone to organize the surplus labor force and turn bad land into good land. The enthusiasm of the members increased, and Li Hengchang, a cooperative member in his sixties, said: "There is great strength in organization. Things that couldn't be done in the past can now be done. I'm not afraid of getting tired, give me hard work to do!" They then divided into groups and put forward the slogan "We must turn sandy and low-lying land into fertile fields!"

    利用荒山空地种植粮食果蔬
    把荒洲变为良田
    江西省永新县一区才丰乡曾家村，有一块荒洲，遍地生着荆棘，草长有三尺多高，从来没有开垦过。今春，互助组长黄日朵出席县第三届劳动模范大会回来，向组员们传达了在县里开会的情形，要大家多想办法，增产粮食。组员们便提出要把那块荒洲开出来，改为良田。
    黄日朵同意大家的意见，领着二十五个组员趁天一亮就去开荒，经过组员们三天的努力，终于把这块荒洲变成了良田，估计每年可收谷子一千二百多斤。
      蕃薯“上山”
    上尤村是福建省闽侯县的一个小山村，俗话说：“靠山吃山养山。”但村后一片好山坡却一直荒着。
    村里的农民虽然早就想上山开荒种蕃薯，但因为山上有山猪，都不愿意上山垦植，怕长出的粮食被山猪偷吃。今年二月间，村里成立了农业生产合作社。党支部书记陈依明也参加了这个社。他想：
  “农业社人多力量大，可以上山去开荒种上大片的蕃薯，粮食就会增加了。再说，农业社人多，可以在山上搭个草棚，派人看守，就再也不怕山猪了。”他就在社里提出上山开荒种蕃薯的事来。这正是社员们长久以来希望实现的心愿，大家一致表示赞成。
      一天，天色灰濛濛的，下着细雨，社员们喜洋洋地一道上山开荒去了。他们用三十五个工，开出了可种七千株蕃薯的蕃薯园。他们很有信心地认为：不久的将来，蕃薯就可以全部种在山上，好田上全部改种水稻。
      旱坡地变成了菜园
    甘肃省镇原县席家沟有块高低不平的旱坡地，常被山水冲刷。去年农民张廷奎在下坡边沿上打了四尺多高的围墙，就原来地势作了许多畦。然后在沟渠里压了小坝，把水位提高，开了小渠，将沟水引到地里。这块地较一般菜园地陡，为了防止急流冲坏地畦，又在菜园进口处挖了个小涝池，先把水放入池内，然后再引入地中，这样不仅使水流缓和，而且还可蓄水；在与菜园相接的山地上打起二尺多高的土堰，这样不但可以挡住山洪，还可以保持了山地的水土。去年这二亩地种菜收入比以往增加了一倍多。为争取丰收，张廷奎还在更多地改造坡地，使它变成平整的水田。
      利用路边塘边种瓜菜
    江苏省靖江县团结乡小营村农业生产合作社第三生产队，在场边、路边、水塘边和坟边进行翻耕活土，共种北瓜一百四十五棵、黄瓜五百五十棵、玉米七百一十棵，还种了七百棵向日葵。社员陆小纲去年在场边种了十四棵北瓜，结了一百十二个瓜，节省了不少的粮食。今年他决定种二十棵北瓜。大家计算了一下，要是全队十三户把瓜菜等都培植好，就能节省九百六十斤米。
      变荒山荒沟为果园
    辽西省北镇县是个山区。去年春、秋两季，全县共栽苹果树十二万二千多棵；今年春季计划再栽五万五千棵苹果树和五百棵葡萄。当这个消息传到村里的时候，农民提出了“一定要把荒山荒沟都变成果园”的口号，果树生产合作社和互助组都争着多栽。一区小常屯一个屯就计划栽五千二百棵。各区抽调许多干部下乡，帮助农民解决有关栽植方面的技术问题。从四月十日起，各地已普遍开始栽植。
      在荒山上种油茶
    江苏省宜兴、丹徒、溧水、句容、溧阳等县人民，利用山区荒地，扩植油料树——油茶。油茶树是多年生的常绿小乔木，种植后约七、八年即开始开花结实，每亩茶籽可年产纯油九十斤。因此，油茶树不仅是良好的油料作物，而且它可以保持水土，防止山洪暴发。镇江国营四益农场今年春天利用油桐与松林隙地种植了五百余亩；宜兴县林场在蒿山乔荒地进行了直播试植；丹徒县九品乡王钱华农业生产合作社与上党区青山乡韦大喜农业生产合作社，利用山地扩植了油茶树四十五亩。估计镇江专区山区今春种植的油茶树可达到一千亩。秋后镇江、苏州两专区将发动山区群众扩植油茶，徐州专区及灌云县等山区将有计划地扩植胡桃油料树。
      多种芝麻，多打油
    湖北省大悟县邓畈乡联盟农业生产合作社社长邓富本，有一天同社员们一起研究怎样使油料作物增产。有个社员提出：如果把河对岸的荒地开出来种芝麻，既能增加油料作物生产，又能使社员增加收入。这个意见大家认为很好。第二天一早，社长邓富本便带领全社社员去开荒，三天时间就把十六亩地全开出来了。社里又修订了计划，决定将这十六亩地全种上芝麻，比去年油料作物面积扩大了四倍。
    该乡邓安义互助组看到合作社开荒种芝麻，也打算开出三亩荒地，扩种二亩地的芝麻。
      荒荡改成美丽的桑园
    江苏如皋县顾家庄农业生产合作社建社时，筹备委员会主任沈文俊建议：“把庄门口的二十亩荒荡开垦了，种上湖桑，三、五年后就可以养蚕，那多好！”
    这个建议很快就被大家通过了，一百多个人组织起来，进行集体劳动。年轻的姑娘们挥着钉钯，翻着长满茅草的荒地，拾起草根，一把把塞进身边的篮子里，头发斑白的老爹爹，也显得年轻了，吐些唾沫在手掌上一搓，举起钉钯说道：“小伙子，来吧！看看我老头子可行！”当太阳还没下山的时候，就把二十亩地的土翻松，茅草也清除得干干净净。
      一片荒田已经变成肥美的土地，几年以后这里就会变成美丽的桑园。
      坏地变好地，增产二十石粮
    辽东省新金县十一区杨树房村五星农业生产合作社，有二十多亩地是沙包地、洼地和石头多的地。北山棉花地叫石头压的年年出不齐，必须把石头都拣出来；东荒格子好几块地的地垄很短，不够撩地头的，必须把地沟垫平，连接起来，改成长垄，才能扩大耕地面积；十六亩涝洼地需要往里拉泥二千五百堆。这些土地改良之后，至少能增产二十石粮。另外，八亩菜地中有四亩是沙包地，不抗旱，需要把沙子挖出去，垫上好土。
    为了提高产量，社里号召大家把剩余劳动力组织起来，变坏地为好地。社员情绪提高了，六十多岁的社员李恒昌说：“组织起来力量大，过去办不到的事，现在可以办到，我不怕累，给我硬活干！”他们便划分了小组，提出“一定要把沙地洼地变成良田！”
