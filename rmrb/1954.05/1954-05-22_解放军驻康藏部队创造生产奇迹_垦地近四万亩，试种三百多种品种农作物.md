Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 21st: On the Kangzang Plateau, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army has created an astonishing miracle in agricultural production. In 1951, after completing a arduous march of thousands of miles, the PLA troops entering Tibet devoted themselves to agricultural production with selfless labor. Over the past three years, the soldiers have been reclaiming land in the wilderness stretching thousands of miles, turning many thorny and rocky wastelands into fertile fields. The soldiers have reclaimed nearly 40,000 mu of wasteland, planted more than 300 varieties of crops and more than 20 varieties of fruit trees and forest trees; and built more than 110 water conservancy and irrigation projects, with a total length of more than 200 li of canals. Thanks to the hard work of the soldiers, there have been successive years of good harvests, and vegetables can now be completely self-sufficient. In a certain area in the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, about 4,000 meters above sea level, the climate is extremely harsh, with frequent hail and sandstorms. Here, the soldiers overcame various natural disasters and turned a barren beach into a black, oily land in just over a month, planting highland barley, wheat, and more than ten kinds of vegetables. Last autumn, a bumper harvest was reaped, with an average yield of more than 100 jin of grain per mu, and more than 5,000 jin of vegetables per mu. In Jiali Zong, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level and surrounded by snow-capped mountains all year round, crops are difficult to grow. The highland barley planted by the local Tibetans does not produce seeds, and can only be cut down as feed for livestock during the harvest season. It is difficult to eat fresh vegetables all year round. Last year, the soldiers reclaimed land for production here, planting highland barley and vegetables. They selected cold-resistant and short-growing varieties, and braved wind and snow to plant and harvest as quickly as possible. As a result, all the highland barley produced seeds, and the vegetables also yielded about 5,000 jin per mu. This year, many Tibetans in Jiali Zong are confidently planting crops according to the methods of the People's Liberation Army.

Last spring, the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army established agricultural experimental farms in Lhasa, Xigaze, Changdu and other places, cultivating 162 kinds of crops selected locally and introduced from other places, 159 kinds of vegetables, and 19 kinds of fruit trees and forest trees. The test results showed that more than 90% of them can grow, and the yield is very high. The yield of Ukrainian winter wheat and other crops is about 700 to 1,000 jin per mu, and the yield of cabbage and radishes has approached 10,000 jin per mu. The growth of melons, beans, tobacco and other crops is also very good. Officials of the Tibetan local government and nearby farmers often come to the experimental farms to visit and learn cultivation methods. These experimental farms have been equipped with hotbeds and greenhouses, and various new agricultural tools have been added. In order to further develop agricultural production in the Tibet region, the Tibet Military Region also opened an agricultural technology cadre training class in Lhasa in January last year to train a group of junior agricultural technology cadres.

    解放军驻康藏部队创造生产奇迹
    垦地近四万亩，试种三百多种品种农作物
    【新华社拉萨二十一日电】在康藏高原上，英勇的中国人民解放军在农业生产中创造了惊人的奇迹。一九五一年，人民解放军进藏部队在结束数千里的艰苦行军以后，就以忘我的劳动精神投入了农业生产。三年来，战士们在纵横数千里的原野上开垦着，将许多荆棘丛生、乱石累累的荒地变成了良田。战士们共开垦了近四万亩荒地，栽种了三百多种品种的农作物以及二十多种果木、林木；兴修了一百一十多座水利灌溉工程，干渠总长二百多里。由于战士们的辛勤劳动，连年丰收，蔬菜已能全部自给。在拔海约四千公尺的雅鲁藏布江上游某地，气候异常恶劣，经常有冰雹和大风沙的袭击，战士们在这里战胜了各种自然灾害，在一个多月内就把荒滩变成一片黑油油的土地，种上了青稞、小麦和十多种蔬菜，去年秋天获得丰收，每亩地平均打了一百多斤粮食，蔬菜每亩收获量达到五千斤以上。在拔海四千多公尺终年被雪山所环抱的嘉黎宗，农作物很难生长，当地藏民所种的青稞都不结籽，到秋收时候只能割下来作为喂牲畜的饲料，一年四季很难吃到新鲜的蔬菜。去年，战士们在这里开荒生产，栽种了青稞和蔬菜，他们选择耐寒和生长期较短的品种，冒着风雪进行抢种抢收，结果青稞全部结籽，蔬菜也得到每亩五千斤左右的收成。今年，嘉黎宗许多藏民都依照人民解放军的方法满怀信心地种上了庄稼。
    去年春季，人民解放军西藏军区在拉萨、日喀则、昌都等地开办了农业试验场，栽培了在当地选择的和外地引种的作物一百六十二种，蔬菜一百五十九种，果树、林木十九种，试验结果，其中百分之九十以上都可以生长，产量很高。乌克兰冬小麦等每亩产量在七百斤到一千斤左右，甘蓝、大萝卜每亩产量已接近一万斤，瓜类、豆类、烟叶等作物生长情况也很良好。西藏地方政府官员和附近农民经常到试验场来参观，学习栽培方法。这些试验场里已设有温床、温室，并添置了各种新式农具。为进一步发展西藏地区的农业生产，去年一月西藏军区还在拉萨开办了农业技术干部训练班，培养了一批初级农业技术干部。
