Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 9th: A five-member delegation of workers from the port of Marseilles, France, arrived in Geneva and, on the evening of the 8th, delivered a letter of appeal demanding the restoration of peace in Indochina and further relaxation of international tensions to the delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Geneva Conference. They also delivered the same appeal to the delegations of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

    The workers of the port of Marseilles, like all workers in France, are closely watching the work of the Geneva Conference.
    With the convening of this conference, the actions of peace-loving people of all countries have generated great hope.
    In particular, the workers of the port of Marseilles, dockworkers, employees of various transportation companies, and truck drivers have taken concrete action since 1949 to strive for the cessation of the war in Indochina.
    In 1950, six thousand workers of the port of Marseilles, with close unity and powerful action, took concrete action in the form of a forty-day strike to fight for peace in Indochina. They waged a patriotic struggle against reactionary and bellicose forces.
    The workers of the port of Marseilles long for peace for their own special reasons, because they know that only in an atmosphere of relaxed international tensions and normal trade with all countries can they avoid unemployment and family poverty.
    Today, the workers of the port of Marseilles stand together with the vast majority of the French people who demand the realization of peace in Indochina, fighting for their special reasons, hoping that the Geneva Conference can achieve an immediate ceasefire that the French people desire, and hoping that Bidault, representing the French government, will respect this strongly expressed wish.
    The workers of the port of Marseilles have sent a delegation to contact the delegations of various countries participating in the Geneva Conference, in order to express their firm determination to see the negotiations for a ceasefire in Indochina—the prelude to peace and the relaxation of international tensions—succeed.

Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: According to Vietnam News Agency: A special correspondent of Vietnam News Agency reported from Geneva on the 10th: A delegation of the French Women's Union visited the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participating in the Geneva Conference on May 6th. The delegation of the French Women's Union requested the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to convey to President Ho Chi Minh the thanks of French women for his unwavering efforts to achieve peace through negotiations. The delegation of the French Women's Union also issued an open letter through the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, requesting the delegates of all countries participating in the Geneva Conference to promote negotiations in order to achieve a ceasefire in Indochina.

    Many family members of French prisoners of war wrote letters to the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam or visited the delegation to inquire about the news of their families and expressed their gratitude for the policy of leniency towards prisoners of war adopted by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    马赛港工人代表团到日内瓦向各国代表团呼吁
    要求恢复印度支那和平缓和国际紧张局势
    法兰西妇女联盟代表团访问越南民主共和国代表团
    【新华社日内瓦九日电】由五人组成的法国马赛港工人代表团到达日内瓦，并在八日晚间把要求恢复印度支那和平及进一步缓和国际紧张局势的呼吁书一份送交出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团，他们并把相同的呼吁书送交苏联、英国、法国、美国和越南民主共和国的代表团。呼吁书全文如下：
    马赛港工人和法国所有的工人一样，正密切注意着日内瓦会议的工作。
    随着这个会议的召开，热爱和平的各国人民的行动已产生了巨大的希望。
    特别是马赛港工人、码头工人、各运输企业职工和汽车司机，自从一九四九年以来，就为争取停止印度支那战争而采取了具体的行动。
    在一九五零年，马赛港六千名工人曾以紧密团结和强大有力的行动，以罢工四十天的具体行动，来争取印度支那的和平。他们进行了一次反对反动和好战势力的爱国斗争。
    马赛港工人们渴望和平，是有他们自己的特殊理由的，因为他们知道，只有在国际局势缓和以及与所有国家进行正常贸易的气氛中，他们才能免于失业和家庭贫困。
    今天，马赛港工人和要求实现印度支那和平的绝大多数法国人民在一起，为了他们的特殊理由而进行斗争，希望日内瓦会议能达成法国人民所希望的立即停火，并希望代表法国政府的皮杜尔尊重这个强烈表示出来的愿望。
    马赛港工人选派了一个代表团来和参加日内瓦会议的各国代表接触，以便表示他们希望看到印度支那停火——和平与缓和国际局势的序幕——的谈判得到成功的坚定决心。
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南通讯社特派记者十日自日内瓦报道：法兰西妇女联盟代表团在五月六日访问了参加日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团。法兰西妇女联盟代表团要求越南民主共和国代表团为法国妇女向胡志明主席致谢，感谢他作了坚持不渝的努力，争取以谈判方式实现和平。法兰西妇女联盟代表团还通过越南民主共和国代表团发表了一封公开信，要求参加日内瓦会议的各国代表们促进谈判，以便实现印度支那的停火。
    许多法军战俘的家属写信给越南民主共和国代表团或访问代表团，探询他们家属的消息，并对于越南民主共和国政府宽待战俘的政策表示感谢。
