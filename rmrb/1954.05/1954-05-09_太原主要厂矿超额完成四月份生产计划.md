[From Our Newspaper in Taiyuan, 7th] Most factories and mines in Taiyuan City exceeded the state production plan for April. According to statistics from twenty-six major factories and mines, twenty-one of them exceeded the plan; twenty-two of the twenty-seven major products exceeded the plan.

During April, workers in various factories and mines launched a labor emulation drive to welcome "May Day," and many new records emerged. On April 19th, the No. 2 blast furnace of the Iron Smelting Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created the highest daily output record, with a furnace utilization coefficient of 0.818, an increase of 20% over the original plan. A certain electric furnace in the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department set a new record of smelting 125 times with furnace wall, more than double the new record of the first quarter. Zhang Laichun, a worker at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, improved the tool for sawing large timbers, increasing efficiency by fifteen times. Yao Guangming, a worker at the Shanxi Machine Factory, improved two sets of tools for manufacturing settling tubes for drilling rigs, completing the entire month's task in three days. These have played a significant role in completing the production plan. Currently, the factories and mines in Taiyuan City are striving to complete 53% of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

    太原主要厂矿超额完成四月份生产计划
    【本报太原七日电】太原市大部厂矿超额完成了四月份国家生产计划。根据二十六个主要厂矿的统计，有二十一个厂矿超额完成了计划；二十七种主要产品有二十二种超额完成了计划。
    四月间，各厂矿职工展开了迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛，出现了不少新纪录。太原钢铁厂炼铁部第二高炉在四月十九日创造了日产量最高纪录，高炉利用系数达零点八一八，比原计划提高了百分之二十；电炉炼钢部某号电炉再创炉墙冶炼一百二十五次的新纪录，比第一季度的新纪录又提高了一倍以上。太原重型机器厂工人张来春改进锯大元木工具，提高效率十五倍。山西机器厂工人姚光明，改进制造钻探机沉淀管的两套工具，三天便完成了全月的任务。这些都对完成生产计划起了很大作用。现在太原市各厂矿正为争取在上半年完成全年计划的百分之五十三而奋斗。
