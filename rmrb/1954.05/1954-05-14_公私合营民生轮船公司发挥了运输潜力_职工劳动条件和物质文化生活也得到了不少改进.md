The creative labor of thousands of employees at the joint public-private 民生 Shipping Company has changed the old pattern of operating losses during the Yangtze River's dry season. Last year, during the dry season, the employees put forward the slogan "Strive for a balanced income and expenditure in the dry season" and launched a campaign for fully loaded, expedited voyages, creating a precedent for the 民生 Shipping Company to break even during the dry season. The volume of goods transported this dry season is approximately double that of the same period last year. In the first four months of this year, the average monthly cargo volume increased threefold compared to before the joint public-private venture.

Dry season navigation, barge towing, and moonlit navigation, once unimaginable on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, have all been successfully trialed by the crew members of the 民生 Shipping Company. Last year, during the dry season, fast cargo ships navigated the shoal-ridden and shallow Sichuan River for the first time. This dry season, fast cargo ships navigating the Sichuan River can tow and push barges. When the river is wide and the current strong, the crew of the "生黎" (Sheng Li) vessel even towed nine barges, and the "生灵" (Sheng Ling) vessel pushed nine barges. Ordinary passenger and cargo ships can also tow two or three barges. These efforts by the crew members have more than doubled the cargo carrying capacity per horsepower. Adhering to the principle of safe navigation, the drivers used moonlight and starlight to open up night navigation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River; they carefully selected slow currents when sailing upstream; and the crew members also established cargo loading and unloading contracts with some ports along the river, thus shortening the travel time between Shanghai and Yichang, Hankou and Yichang, Hankou and Chongqing, and Yichang and Chongqing by one-third to one-half compared to before the joint public-private venture.

The crew members have also come up with many ways to increase the cargo carrying capacity of the ships. They cleared long-accumulated useless, stagnant materials, scrap materials, mud and water from the bottom of the ships, and heavy iron plates that had been specially installed before liberation to prevent gunfire from the Kuomintang bandit troops, freeing up cabins to load cargo. The "民主" (Democracy) and "民万" (Min Wan) passenger and cargo ships alone could load an additional 170 tons of cargo using this method. In the past, ships such as the "荆门" (Jingmen), "乌江" (Wujiang), and "民和" (Minhe) carried fresh water for the voyage from the shore. Later, the crew members installed water filtration equipment on the ships, allowing the cabins that originally held dozens of tons of fresh water to be used to transport cargo.

The gradual formation of a thrift-oriented atmosphere among the vast number of employees of the 民生 Shipping Company has also reduced the company's operating expenses. Taking the saving of ship repair costs as an example, in the past, when ships entered the shipyard, the crew members would go ashore for sightseeing. Now, the crew members try to repair the ships themselves as much as possible and strive to leave the shipyard as soon as possible. The "民康" (Min Kang) passenger and cargo ship alone saved 300 million yuan in repair costs by being repaired by the crew members themselves at the end of last year. In addition, many of the company's crew members use old ropes from the ships to make necessary fenders and pay attention to the maintenance of the ships, which has greatly reduced transportation costs on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

After the establishment of the joint public-private 民生 Shipping Company, the working conditions and material and cultural life of the employees have gradually improved with the development and improvement of the business. In previous years, the temperature in the furnace rooms and engine rooms on the ships would reach as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, and the workers would sweat all day long. Last summer, some ships were equipped with equipment to reduce the high temperature in the engine rooms. Before the arrival of this hot summer, six ships, including the "民权" (Min Quan) and "民康" (Min Kang), will also be equipped with wind blowers to reduce the high temperature in the engine rooms to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit in hot weather. After the establishment of the joint public-private 民生 Shipping Company, hoisting tools and dockside rain shelters have also been added successively in ports such as Chongqing, Yichang, and Hankou to gradually improve the working conditions of the stevedores. Last year, the 民生 Shipping Company also conducted a major safety inspection, and after the inspection, more than 3,600 safety devices were added on the ships and on shore.

The material and cultural life of the employees has improved considerably compared to before the establishment of the joint public-private company. The first batch of employee dormitories newly built in Hankou, Yichang, and other places has been completed, and many employees have moved into new homes. The construction of eight new employee dormitories in Chongqing has also been completed, and the interior is now being painted and equipment is being installed. The second batch of employee dormitories planned to be built in Hankou this year will also begin construction soon. Over the past year, the 民生 Shipping Company has also built employee hospitals and employee sanatoriums, and larger ships have been equipped with health workers. Crew members can receive timely medical treatment and recuperation when they are ill. Cultural and recreational activities have also become active for crew members sailing on the Yangtze River. The cultural and after-school education held on the ships has enabled more than 200 illiterate people to read newspapers or write letters last year. Mobile book boxes have been set up on the ships, and many ships also have basketballs and badminton rackets. (Xinhua News Agency)

    公私合营民生轮船公司发挥了运输潜力
    职工劳动条件和物质文化生活也得到了不少改进
    公私合营民生轮船公司数千职工创造性的劳动，改变了历年长江枯水季节航运营业亏损的旧规律。去年枯水季节，职工们提出“争取枯水季节收支平衡”的口号，展开满载赶航运动，创造了民生轮船公司枯水季节收支平衡的先例。今年枯水季节运输的货物，约比去年同期增加一倍。在今年头四个月里，每月平均的货运量比合营前增加了三倍。
    长江上游过去不能设想的枯水航行、拖带驳船和月夜航行，都被民生轮船公司的船员们试航成功了。去年枯水季节，快速货船第一次走通了礁多水浅的川江。今年枯水季节快速货船行驶川江时，就能够拖带和顶推驳船了。当江水阔旺时，“生黎”轮的船员们甚至拖带了九只驳船，“生灵”轮顶推了九只驳船，一般客货轮也能拖带两三只驳船了。船员们的这些努力，使原来每匹马力拖运货物的能力提高了两倍以上。驾驶人员在安全航行的原则下，利用月亮星光开辟了长江上游的夜航；溯江上驶时细心地选择缓流；船员们并和沿江有些港口订立装卸货物的联系合同，因此使上海和宜昌、汉口和宜昌、汉口和重庆、宜昌和重庆间的航行时间比合营前缩短了三分之一到二分之一。
    船员们还想出许多办法增加船舶装载货物的能力。他们从船舱里清除了常年堆积无用的呆滞材料、废旧材料、船底的泥水和解放前为防避国民党匪军枪击特别装上去的笨重的铁板，让出舱房装载货物。仅“民主”、“民万”客货轮用这个办法就可多装载一百七十多吨货物。“荆门”、“乌江”、“民和”等轮过去在航程中所用的清水，都是从岸上带去的，后来船员们在船上装设了滤水设备，使原来每只船可容数十吨清水的船舱也用来装运货物。
    民生轮船公司的广大职工节约风气的逐渐形成，也减少了公司的营业支出。以节省修船费用为例，往日船舶进了修船厂，船员们就上岸游逛去了。现在，船员们尽量自己修理，并争取早日出厂。仅“民康”客货轮去年年底由船员们自己修理，就节省了三亿元的修理费。另外，公司的很多船员们利用船上的废旧棕绳做成船舶必需的靠把，注意船舶的保养等，都大大降低了在长江上游的运输成本。

    民生轮船公司公私合营后，职工的劳动条件和物质、文化生活，随着营业的发展和改进逐步得到改善。往年一到夏季，船上炉舱、机舱的温度高达华氏一百二十度左右，工人们整日汗流不止。去年夏季，有的船上装设了降低机舱高温的设备。今年炎夏到来之前，“民权”、“民康”等六只船也将装上打风机，在炎热天把机舱间的高温降低到华氏一百度左右。民生轮船公司公私合营后，还在重庆、宜昌、汉口等港口陆续添设了起重工具和栈道雨篷，逐步改善装卸工人的劳动条件。去年，民生轮船公司还举行过一次安全大检查，检查后在船上、岸上添设了三千六百多件安全设备。
    职工的物质、文化生活和公司公私合营前比较，有了不少改进。在汉口、宜昌等地新建的第一批职工宿舍已经落成，已有许多职工迁进新居。在重庆新建的八栋职工宿舍，也已完成土木建筑工程，现在正在粉刷内部和安装设备。今年计划在汉口兴建的第二批职工宿舍不久也要动工了。一年多以来，民生轮船公司还建设了职工医院和职工疗养院，较大的船上都配备了保健员。船员们患病能及时得到医治和疗养。在长江上航行的船员们，文化娱乐活动也活跃起来了。船上举办的文化业余教育，去年已使二百多个文盲能读报或写信。船上普遍设立了流动图书箱，很多船上还备有篮球和羽毛球。　（新华社）
