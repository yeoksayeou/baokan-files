    Vegetable Sowing Area Expanded in the Suburbs of Shenyang This Year
    This year, the vegetable sowing area in the suburbs of Shenyang has reached more than 13,100 hectares, with a planned annual production of 262,800 tons of fresh vegetables, supplying 197,100 tons to the city, an increase of 36% compared to last year. The area of irrigated land has also been expanded. It is planned to build 250 new wells, and more than 140 wells have already been dug and equipped with water wheels. It is also planned to drill two electric wells in May to grow more delicate vegetables, extend the production season, and ensure a balanced supply to meet the city's needs.
    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in vegetable production has also developed greatly. Last year, there were only eleven vegetable production cooperatives, but this year the number has increased to thirty-nine. The vast majority of cooperatives have played a leading and exemplary role. The "May 3rd" Vegetable Production Cooperative in Shenhe District and the Yushutai Vegetable Production Cooperative in Baitapu District have developed a method of covering cucumbers with oiled paper to supply vegetables to the market earlier. This involves inserting bamboo sticks next to the seedlings when they are moved from the seedbed to the ground, covering them with oiled paper to protect them from wind, cold, and frost damage, and promoting early cucumber maturity. The First Joint Group in Tiexi District successfully replaced manual ditch digging with new-style walking plows, saving labor and having a positive impact on surrounding vegetable farmers.
    In order to improve technology and exchange experiences, the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry organized technical cadres and technical team leaders from vegetable production cooperatives to study in Beijing, Dalian, and Anshan. After returning, they held several experience exchange meetings. Vegetable farmers generally recognized that reforming technology is a crucial key to increasing yields. Currently, most vegetable farmers are using hotbeds for seedling cultivation and have prepared various medicines and equipment. (Zhao Xueru)

    沈阳市郊今年蔬菜播种面积扩大
    今年沈阳市郊蔬菜播种面积已达一万三千一百余垧，计划全年生产新鲜蔬菜二十六万二千八百吨，供应市内十九万七千一百吨，比去年增加百分之三十六。水浇地面积更有所扩大，计划新建水井二百五十眼，现在已挖完并且安装上水车的就有一百四十多眼。还计划在五月份内打两眼电力井，以便多种细菜，延长生产季节，均衡地供应城市需要。
    蔬菜生产的互助合作运动也有很大发展，去年只有十一个蔬菜生产合作社，今年就发展到三十九个。极大多数的合作社都起了带头示范作用。沈河区“五三”蔬菜生产合作社与白塔铺区榆树台蔬菜生产合作社，为了提早供应市场蔬菜，研究出用油纸扣黄瓜的办法，就是由苗床移到地上时，在苗旁插上竹签，上覆油纸，可防风寒和霜害，并能促进黄瓜提早成熟。铁西区第一联组试用新式步犁翻地代替人力刨池子获得成功，节省了劳动力，并对周围菜农起了良好的影响。
    为了提高技术、交流经验，市农林局曾组织技术干部与蔬菜生产合作社的技术组长等到北京、旅大、鞍山等地学习，回来以后又召集了数次经验交流会，菜农普遍地认识到改革技术是提高产量的重要关键。目前大部菜农都采用温床育苗的办法，并准备了各种药品和器材。　（赵学儒）
