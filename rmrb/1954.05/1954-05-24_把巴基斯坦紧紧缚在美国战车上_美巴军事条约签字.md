Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: After a long period of planning by the United States, the so-called US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," which intensifies the enslavement of Pakistan and ties it tightly to the American war chariot, was signed in Karachi on the 19th. This aggressive deployment by the United States increases the threat to peace and security in Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East.

The signing of the US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" fully demonstrates that the purpose of American military "aid" to Pakistan is to make Pakistan a pawn in the US's actively planned Middle East aggressive bloc. According to foreign news agencies, the agreement stipulates that the United States will provide Pakistan with military equipment, materials, services, and other "assistance" to "help Pakistan build its army into a modern and highly efficient combat force." According to a United Press International report from Washington, the United States plans to give Pakistan military "aid" worth approximately $75 million in the next twelve months. At the same time, the agreement itself indicates that it is concluded under the notorious US "Mutual Defense Assistance Act" and "Mutual Security Act." Therefore, Pakistan must not only provide "full contributions" to "develop and maintain" its own armed forces, but also "provide full contributions to the defense strength of the free world." This means that Pakistan must accept American orders and use Asians to fight Asians for the United States.

According to the agreement, the United States will establish a "Military Advisory Group" in Pakistan, which will have "full facilities and authority to inspect and use assistance" and enjoy the privileges of diplomatic personnel. In this way, the United States can directly interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs. In addition, the US and Pakistani "governments will negotiate appropriate arrangements for the exchange of patent rights and technical information on defense matters." In this way, Pakistan's national defense and armed forces will be completely under the supervision and control of the United States. Not only that, the agreement stipulates that the Pakistani government needs to provide the US government with rupees as administrative and operating expenses needed by the US government to implement the agreement.

The US-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" is not only a military alliance, but also a chain of economic enslavement. The agreement stipulates that Pakistan agrees to "cooperate" with the United States in its "embargo" measures. At the same time, Pakistan will also provide raw materials and semi-processed materials to the United States under "certain conditions."

### 把巴基斯坦紧紧缚在美国战车上  美巴军事条约签字

    把巴基斯坦紧紧缚在美国战车上
    美巴军事条约签字
    据新华社讯：经过美国的长期策划，美国加紧奴役巴基斯坦并把它紧紧缚在战车上的所谓美巴“共同防御援助协定”，已于十九日在喀喇蚩签字。美国这一侵略部署增加了对东南亚和中近东地区的和平与安全的威胁。
    美巴“共同防御援助协定”的签订充分说明：美国军事“援助”巴基斯坦的目的在于使巴基斯坦成为美国积极策划的中东侵略集团的走卒。据外国通讯社报道，协定规定，美国将给予巴基斯坦以军事装备、物资、劳务及其他“援助”，以“帮助巴基斯坦把它的军队建成一支现代化的、有高度效率的作战部队”。据合众社华盛顿消息透露，美国计划在今后十二个月中给巴基斯坦约值七千五百万美元的军事“援助”。同时，协定本身表明：协定是根据臭名远扬的美国“共同防御援助法”和“共同安全法”缔结的。因此，巴基斯坦不仅要对“发展和维持”它本身的武装力量提供“充分的贡献”，并且要“对自由世界的防务实力提供充分的贡献”。这就是说要巴基斯坦接受美国命令，替美国用亚洲人打亚洲人。
    根据协定，美国要在巴基斯坦设立一个“军事顾问团”，这个顾问团“有完全的便利和权力来视察和使用援助”，并且享有外交人员的特权。这样，美国就可以直接干涉巴基斯坦的内政。另外，美巴“两国政府还将谈判交换关于防务方面的专利权和技术情报的适当的安排”。这样，巴基斯坦的国防与武装力量就完全处于美国的监督和控制之下。不但如此，协定规定，巴基斯坦政府需要供给美国政府以卢比，作为美国政府为执行这个协定而需要的行政与工作费用。
    美巴“共同防御援助协定”不仅是个军事性的同盟，并且也是一条经济奴役的锁链。协定规定，巴基斯坦同意在美国的“禁运”措施方面和美国“合作”。同时，巴基斯坦还将在“某种条件”下向美国提供原料和半加工物资。
