　　Change All Manual Operations to Mechanization
　　Huang Rongchang, Special-Class Labor Model of Chongqing 101 Factory

　　I entered the Civil Engineering Section of Chongqing 101 Factory in 1950. The carpentry workshop where I worked was responsible for repairing the dormitories of several thousand employees and dozens of factory buildings throughout the factory, as well as manufacturing furniture for these many people. Even with more than 120 carpenters working from dawn till dusk, we still couldn't complete the tasks, and some carpentry work had to be contracted out. At that time, the factory frequently held production competitions; today someone creates a new record here, tomorrow someone creates an even higher record there, one surpassing the other. But the carpentry workshop remained stagnant, and everyone couldn't muster any enthusiasm. Some carpenters requested to be transferred to other main workshops, and I was very anxious.

　　One day, I passed by the steel bar workshop and glanced inside. I saw a long, red-hot steel bar rushing past me like lightning, startling me. Then I saw the steel bar being divided into two sections by a machine with a "snap." A thought suddenly struck me: "If such a heavy and thick steel bar can be cut into two sections by a machine in an instant, why can't wood be cut instantly?" I also thought, "In movies, I've seen Soviet farmers using machines to cultivate the land. I've heard that everything in the Soviet Union is done by machines, so wood must be cut by machines. Why don't I try to make a wood-sawing machine?" But then I thought there were too many difficulties. I hadn't even seen a machine before, how could I build one? But another thought immediately took over: "Machines are made by workers, and I am a worker too. If others can make machines, why can't I?"

　　After that, every day when I passed the steel bar workshop, I would stand and watch carefully for a while. I noticed that the steel saw was like a saw, only the shape was round. I thought of imitating it. I told others what I was thinking, but as soon as I spoke, the conservative old technical carpenters shook their heads. They said, "Grandpa Lu Ban passed down the tradition of pushing, planing, pulling, and sawing. You are just a small carpenter who wants to invent a machine as soon as you enter the factory? We have been doing this for decades and haven't come up with a machine. Don't daydream!" The foreman of our section (later discovered to be a embezzler during the "Three-Anti" campaign) not only didn't support me but also stopped me, saying, "Building a machine requires design and drawing. You don't understand anything. You are not allowed to mess around." I disregarded all obstacles, thinking, "If you don't support me, I can still consult the factory director, the Party committee, and the trade union!"

　　In May, the delegation of returning volunteers from Korea came to 101 Factory to give a report. They said that the volunteers at the front lines, in order to ensure the smooth completion of transportation tasks, under difficult conditions with no materials and no technical guidance, used their brains, used discarded shells to make bellows, used discarded shrapnel to make parts, and transformed discarded gasoline barrels and artillery tubes into various tools, repaired cars, and even established a complete car repair factory. This further strengthened my confidence. I thought that there were many piles of scrap iron and steel near the steel plant, and everything was available. Why not make use of them? After that, whenever I had time, I would run to the scrap iron pile. I picked up usable gears, axle wheel discs, and rollers. Having only materials was not enough without tools. After the trade union chairman, Liu Guangdao, found out, he found me a set of fitter's tools. At night, I stayed in the workshop and filed the center column plate one stroke at a time with a file. When I was tired, I would lie on the shavings for a while. Like grinding an embroidery needle, I finally ground out an axle center, and I also managed to fix the flywheel. But there was no belt. So I tried to weave one with palm rope. Everything was ready, but how to install it? The steel cutting machine used a motor. Where could I get a motor? I remembered that in the countryside, where there was river water, people often used water to turn the millstone. Could a circular saw be turned by water? I pondered and found a water pipe, but the water pressure was too low. When poured on, the machine wouldn't even move. I thought, if the water pipe doesn't work, what about installing a handle and using hand power? When done this way, the machine moved, but it took a long time to saw a piece of wood. I pondered for a long time and finally discovered that the flywheel was placed on the center of the circular saw. If the flywheel and the circular saw were farther apart, there would be no problem. After making this change, it was indeed much more flexible, and the efficiency was twice as fast as manual labor. After the hand-cranked circular saw was made, everyone in the carpentry workshop was overjoyed. But after only two days of joy, the machine was suddenly sabotaged. I wanted to make another one, and someone said, "Wouldn't it be better if the hand-cranked one was changed to a foot-pedaled one?" This sentence inspired me, and I also remembered what the Party Committee's organization secretary, Song Jitian, and the trade union chairman had said to me: "The Party and the trade union will always support you!" I was determined to repair the circular saw. For several nights in a row, I kept exploring and researching. My comrades and I in the group changed the hand-cranked circular saw into a foot-pedaled circular saw. After making this change, the work efficiency increased fourfold. But the machine was sabotaged again the day after it was made; this time the damage was even more severe, with the flywheel, rocker, and saw blade all broken! I thought there must be hidden spies in the factory. After investigation and research, it was proven that there was indeed a special agent in our class, and the government arrested him.

　　After the success of these two machines, my confidence was even more strengthened. I realized that as long as you have the determination, are willing to use your brain, and rely on the Party and the masses, all difficulties can be overcome. One day, I saw the axle disc of a train wheel pushing the body forward. I suddenly thought: "If many saw blades are connected together and mounted on the wheel, and the saw blades are driven by a motor, surely it would be possible to saw a dozen wooden boards at once. How great would that be!" But a pile of problems were in front of me, and I wasn't familiar with the performance of the machines. Later, I found an old technical worker with more than twenty years of experience, Xu Zhanrong, who was a Communist Party member. I told him my wishes in detail and showed him the sketches of the machine. He was very happy after reading it. He said: "Add a ground axis and an eccentric, and use a 20-horsepower motor to drive it." Xu Zhanrong also told me how to install it, calculate the speed, and taught me simple common sense about alternating current and direct current. Later, whenever I encountered difficulties during the installation, I would go to Teacher Xu Zhanrong. One day, the factory held an entertainment party to welcome new workers. I went, and they were singing Sichuan opera. I was considering the installation method of a certain wheel disc and had no intention of watching the show. I stared blankly at the person playing the gong. Suddenly, I was inspired by the posture of the gong player and found a way to install the machine at once. I didn't bother to listen to the play and ran back to the carpentry workshop. I started to install the machine, but installing the machine required digging a large pit in the ground that was five meters long, two meters wide, and three meters deep. At night, I started working. Without digging tools, I used a steel shovel instead of a hoe, made a dustpan out of scrap iron, and tied it with a rope to pull it out and dump it. The rope was rough and rubbed the skin on my back. I thought of the volunteers in Korea bravely fighting the enemy and sacrificing their blood. What was a little bit of skin abrasion to me? When our foreman saw me working so desperately at night, he was very angry. He sent me to carry wood two miles away to the riverbank. He thought that if I carried wood uphill and downhill all day, I would not have the energy to work on the machine at night. The Party Committee's organization secretary learned about this and criticized the workshop leader and transferred me back. The day of the test run arrived. The carpentry workshop was full of people. I was so nervous, afraid that something would go wrong. As soon as I pressed the switch, I saw the motor pulling the flywheel and spinning with a roar. It was spinning so fast! Nine hundred revolutions per minute, even the ground was shaking. Many people were so scared that they ran outside, and my face turned green with fright. I quickly turned off the switch. I went to Xu Zhanrong and asked him what to do. He said that it was simple, just reduce the size of the pulley wheel to make the machine turn three hundred revolutions per minute. After making this change twice, the machine was running normally. As long as the wood was placed on the machine, in the blink of an eye, the boards came out neatly. People in the factory calculated that this machine was 75 times faster than manual operation, and the quality reached 98%. On July 1, 1952, this circular saw machine and a gang saw machine driven by a motor officially participated in production.

　　After the machine was built, I thought that the power of a few people was limited, and all the workers in the group should be mobilized to work together. In order to learn from advanced experiences, my coworkers and I went to 701 Factory to visit. On the way back, we decided to manufacture a cutoff machine, a drilling machine, and a tenon machine as gifts for National Day. Because we had appropriate divisions of labor, we completed the task ahead of schedule before National Day. During the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month in 1952, I successfully made a chamfering machine, and later I created a double-row circular saw, a slotting machine, etc., which greatly improved production. From August 1951 to February 10, 1953, our carpentry workshop built a total of twelve machines. At the factory's labor competition awarding ceremony on February 4, 1953, the Party Secretary announced the official approval of me as a glorious Communist Party member. The administration also promoted me from a fourth-grade worker to a third-grade technician and named me the factory's special-class labor model. Now eight people in our group have initially learned the techniques of machining and fitting, and twenty-four people can master machine operation. After the increase production and conserve campaign started last September, our group made a guarantee to the Party to fully mechanize the carpentry workshop. Through everyone's efforts, by the end of February this year, our carpentry workshop has installed 33 machines, including small circular saw machines, mortising machines, single-sided planers, grinding wheel machines, slotting machines, wood lathes, cutoff machines, large gang saw lathes, and automatic double band saws, and all have been put into operation. The highest of these 33 machines can improve labor efficiency to 78 times, and the lowest is 8 times. In 1953 alone, we saved the country more than 1.42 billion yuan in wages. If all these machines participate in production, they can create more than 5.25 billion yuan of wealth for the country every year. Now there is no phenomenon of a large pile of wood piled up in our carpentry workshop waiting for someone to do it. Our machines only need to be turned on for two hours a day to complete the task. Therefore, we freed up dozens of workers to specialize in research work. When discussing the production plan in the second quarter of this year, we proposed to install a cleaning machine and a large automatic double band machine in addition to manufacturing a mixing machine and a stone grinding machine for the masonry class, helping the kiln worker class install a mixing machine and a stone grinding machine, and manufacturing a brick pressing machine and a tile machine, so that masonry and tile work would also be gradually converted to mechanized operation. Before I came to Beijing to visit the Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition, we had already successfully built the mixing machine and the stone grinding machine. The mixing machine is now officially in production. The process of manufacturing these machines has made me realize that the potential of workers is inexhaustible. In the future, I will definitely work hard with the workers in our carpentry workshop to study technology and create more machines.

    把手工操作全部改成机械化
    重庆一零一厂特等劳动模范　黄荣昌
    我在一九五零年考进重庆一零一厂土木科。我工作的木工房，要负责修理全厂几千户职工的宿舍和数十幢厂房，又要制造这许多人用的家具。虽然一百二十几个木工起早摸黑地干，还是完不成任务，有些木工活不得不包给厂外去做。那时工厂经常开展生产竞赛，今天这里创新纪录啦，明天那里创更高的纪录啦，一个赛过一个。可是木工房却没有动静，大伙都提不起劲儿来。有些木工要求调到别的主要车间去工作，我心里也很着急。
    有一天我经过钢条车间，偶然朝里面望了望，只见一条很长的火红的钢条飞也似的从我眼前冲过去，把我吓了一跳，但又见那个钢条经过一个机器“卡”的一声就分成了两截。我心里突地动了一下：“那么重，那么粗的钢条，都能一下子被机器切成两截，木头为什么不能一下子切断呢？”我又想，在电影里看见苏联的农民都用机器种地，听说在苏联样样都用机器，那么木头一定是用机器切了，自己为什么不试做一个锯木头的机器呢？”再一想，又觉得困难太多，自己连机器都没见过，还能造？但另一种思想立刻又支配了我：“机器是工人造的，我也是个工人，别人能造机器，我为什么不能？”
    以后我每天走过钢条车间，都要站着仔细看一会儿，我发现那个钢锯和锯一样，只是形状是圆的，我想仿着作一个。我把我心里想的告诉了别人，可是话才出口，那些思想保守的老年技术木工就摇头，他们说：“鲁班爷爷传下来都是这样一推一刨一拉一锯的，你一个小木工，刚进厂就想发明机器？我们做了几十年都没搞出机器来，你不要胡思乱想吧！”我们科的领工（后来在“三反”运动中发现他是个贪污犯）不但不支持我，还阻止我说：“造机器要设计，要绘图，你什么也不懂，不准你胡乱搞。”我不顾一切阻挡，心想：“你不支持我，还有厂长、党委和工会可商量呢！”
    五月里，志愿军归国代表团来一零一厂作报告。他们说志愿军在前线，为了保证顺利完成运输任务，在没有物资、没有技术指导的困难条件下，动脑筋，利用废弹壳做风箱，利用废弹片做零件，把废汽油桶、废炮筒改做各种工具，修好了汽车，还建立起很完备的汽车修理厂，这更坚定了我的信心，我想炼钢厂附近的废铁废钢，堆得很多，样样都有。为什么不去利用一下呢？以后一有空，我就往废铁堆里跑，我把可用的牙轮、轴心轮盘、滚轴都拣回来。光有材料，没有工具还是不行。工会主席刘光道知道以后，就给找一套钳工用具。夜里，我留在车间用锉刀一刀一刀地锉柱心板，累了，就躺在刨花上歇一会，像磨绣花针一样，最后总算磨成了个轴心，飞轮也设法收拾好了，但没有皮带。于是我就想法用棕绳编，一切都弄停当了，怎么装呢？切钢机用的是马达，我从那里弄马达呢？我想起乡下有河水的地方，常用水推磨，圆锯可不可以用水打着它转呢？我琢磨着，并找了根水管，可是那水的力量很小，浇上去，机器连动都不动，我又想，水管不行，安个手把，用手摇行不行呢？这样作，机器是动了，但是摇半天才能锯下根木头来，我寻思了好久，才发现原来飞轮放在圆锯的心子上了，如果飞轮和圆锯离得远些，就没有这个问题了。这样改了以后，果然灵活多了，效率比人工快两倍。手摇圆锯机造成以后，木工房的人都乐开了，但乐了没两天，机器忽然叫人给破坏了。我想再做一个，有人就说：“如果把手摇的改成脚踏的，不是更好一点吗？”这句话启示了我，我又想起党委组织干事宋计田和工会主席对我说的话：“党和工会是永远支持你的！”我下决心要把圆锯修复好。一连好多个晚上，我一再摸索和钻研，我和我们小组同志把手摇圆锯机改成了脚踏圆锯机。这样一改，工作效率提高了四倍。可是机器在造好的第二天，又被人破坏了；这次破坏得更厉害，飞轮、摇手、锯片全都坏了！我想厂里一定有暗藏的特务，经过调查研究，证明我们班上真有一个特务分子，政府就把他逮捕了。
    这两部机器创造成功以后，我的信心更坚定了，我认识到：只要有决心，肯动脑筋，依靠党、依靠群众，一切困难都可以克服。一天，我看到火车轮的轴盘推动着车身前进，我忽然想到：如果把许多锯刀连在一起装上车轮，用马达带动锯片，一定能一下子锯十几块木板。那该多好呀！但是在我面前摆着一大堆问题，我不熟悉机器的性能。后来，我找到了一个有二十多年工龄的老技术工人，他叫徐占荣，是个共产党员。我把我的愿望一五一十都告诉了他，并且把机器的草图画给他看。他看了很高兴，他说：“把机器加上一个地轴，一个偏心，用一个二十匹马力的马达就带动了。”徐占荣还告诉我如何安装、算速度，又教给我简单的交流电、直流电的常识。以后我在安装中，碰到困难的地方就去找徐占荣老师傅。有一天厂里开欢迎新工人的娱乐晚会，我去了，唱的是川剧。我正在考虑某一个轮盘的安装法，没心思看戏，我呆呆地望着打锣的人，突然，从打锣人的姿态上得到了启发，一下子把安装机器的办法找出来了，我戏也顾不得听，提起腿就往木工房跑。我开始要安装机器了，但安装机器必须在地下挖一个五公尺长、二公尺宽、三公尺深的大坑，一到夜里，我就动手工作。没有挖土的工具，我就用钢锹代替锄头，废铁皮做簸箕，用绳子系着拉出去倒掉。绳子粗，把背上的皮都擦破了，我想起在朝鲜的志愿军英勇杀敌流血牺牲，自己擦破点皮算得了什么？我们的领工见我晚上这样没命地干，心里很气，他派我到二里外的江边去搬木料，他想我上坡下坡抬一天，晚上就没精神弄机器了。这件事叫党委组织干事知道了，批评了车间领班同志，把我调了回来。试车的那天来了，木工房站满了人，我心里好紧张，生怕出事，我一按电门，只见马达拉着飞轮，轰隆隆地转了起来，转得真快呀！一分钟转九百转，连地都动起来，吓得许多人直往外跑，我的脸也吓青了，急忙把电门关了。我去找徐占荣问他怎么办？他说，这很简单，只要把皮带轮改小，使机器一分钟转三百转就成了。这样改了两次，机器转动得正常了。只要把木料往机器上一放，一转眼，出来的就是整整齐齐的板子。厂里的人给计算了一下，这个机器比人工操作要快七十五倍，质量达到百分之九十八。一九五二年七月一日，这一部圆锯机一部排锯机用马达带动着正式参加了生产。
    机器造好后，我又想少数几个人的力量是有限的，应该发动全小组的工人一起来干才好。为了学习先进经验，我和我们木工房的工人一同到七零一厂去参观，回来的路上，我们就决定制造一部断料机、一部钻眼机和一部梭梢机，作为向国庆节的献礼。因为我们分工适当，不到国庆，我们就提前完成了任务。一九五二年中苏友好月，我又作成功一部落尖机，以后又创造了双行车圆锯、拉槽机等，大大提高了生产。从一九五一年八月到一九五三年二月十日，我们木工房一共造了十二部机器。一九五三年二月四日全厂总结劳动竞赛给奖大会上，党委书记宣布正式批准我为光荣的共产党员。行政方面还把我由四级工人提升为三级技术员，并评为全厂特等劳动模范。现在我们小组有八个人初步学会了车工、钳工的技术，有二十四个人能掌握机器操作。去年九月，增产节约竞赛开始后，我们小组向党提出了保证，要把木工房全面机械化。经过大家的努力，到今年二月末，我们木工房已经装好了小圆锯机、打眼机、单面刨床、砂轮机、拉槽机、木车床、断料机、大排锯车床、自动双带锯等三十三部机器，并且都已动起来了。这三十三部机器中最高能提高劳动效率到七十八倍，最低是八倍，光一九五三年就替国家节约工资十四亿二千余万元。如果这些机器全部参加生产，每年可替国家多创造五十二亿五千多万元的财富。现在我们木工房再没有一大堆木料堆着等人去做的现象了，我们的机器一天只要开两小时就把任务完成了。因此，我们腾出几十个工人专门做研究工作，今年第二季度讨论生产计划时，我们提出除安装清料机，大型自动双带机，还要替泥工班制造一部合灰机和磨石机，帮助窑工班装好一部合灰机和磨石机，制造一部压砖机和洋瓦机，使泥工、瓦工也逐渐改为机械化操作。这次我来北京参观鞍钢技术革新展览会以前，我们已经造成功了合灰机和磨石机，合灰机现已正式参加了生产。从制造这些机器的过程中，使我认识到工人中的潜力是挖不完的。今后我一定和我们木工房的工人好好研究技术，创造更多的机器。
