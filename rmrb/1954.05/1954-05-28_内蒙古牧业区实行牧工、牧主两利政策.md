Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 27th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government is implementing a policy of "no struggle, no division, no class designation" and mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdowners in pastoral areas, promoting the rapid development of animal husbandry production. This policy was formulated by the People's Government based on the actual conditions of pastoral areas and the characteristics of the animal husbandry economy. It protects the interests of herdsmen while also protecting the private property rights of herdowners, gradually bringing prosperity to the pastoral areas' social economy.

In implementing the policy of mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdowners in Inner Mongolia, emphasis has been placed on resolving the wage issue. Each league has formulated wage standards according to local production conditions. In the past, in the Hulunbuir League pastoral area, each herdsman's monthly wage was only one sheep, making it difficult even to maintain personal life. Since the announcement of wage standards, the minimum wage for each herdsman has increased to two sheep. Now, the income of general herdsmen, in addition to their own expenses, can support one to one and a half people, and some herdsmen even have their own livestock. Herdsman Tubuxin of Chen Barag Banner was a herdsman for more than ten years before liberation and was still so poor that he did not even own a single sheep. Because of the increased wages and assistance from the People's Government, he now has more than 300 sheep and 30 cattle and horses, and has also acquired nine carts and a new felt Mongolian yurt. After the improvement of herdsmen's lives, their enthusiasm for production has generally increased, and the livestock they raise has also increased rapidly. Herdowner Da Xidelegeer of Chen Barag Banner had a very slow rate of livestock increase in the past. Thanks to the reasonable resolution of the wage issue, the number of his various livestock has increased more than nine times compared to five years ago.

Each pastoral area has also carried out the work of reforming the old "Surug" system
(Surug is a Mongolian word, which means that the herdowner entrusts the herd to the herdsman for grazing and pays a certain remuneration). In the past, the herdowner's remuneration to the Surug households was only permission to shear wool and milk, without wages, so the Surug households were unwilling to graze well, and the livestock breeding rate and survival rate were very low. In order to change this situation, each league, after discussion by the People's Representative Conference, or through negotiation between the herdowner and the Surug household, stipulated that in addition to wool and dairy products, the Surug household should also receive a portion of the young livestock each year. This change of the old "Surug" system in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit has enabled livestock to breed very quickly. The livestock of herdowner Maolama of New Barag Left Banner had already doubled in 1952 compared to when it was just liberated in 1945. He entrusted 320 Surug sheep to the Huhele Tai Animal Husbandry Production Mutual Aid Team, stipulating that he would receive 160 lambs each year, and after four years he could net 640 sheep, and the mutual aid team could also get more than 400 sheep.

### 内蒙古牧业区实行牧工、牧主两利政策

    内蒙古牧业区实行牧工、牧主两利政策
    【新华社呼和浩特二十七日电】内蒙古自治区人民政府在牧业区实行“不斗不分，不划阶级”和牧工、牧主两利的政策，促进了畜牧业生产的迅速发展。这项政策是人民政府根据牧区实际情况和畜牧业经济特点制订的，它保障了牧工的利益，又保护牧主私有权，使牧区社会经济逐渐繁荣起来。
    内蒙古在实行牧工、牧主两利政策中，着重解决了工资问题，各盟都按照当地生产情况订出了工资标准。原呼纳盟牧区过去每个牧工每月工资只有一只羊，连个人生活也很难维持。自公布工资标准后，每个牧工的最低工资增加到两只羊。现在，一般牧工的工资收入除本身费用外，能养活一个人到一个半人，有些牧工还有了自己的牲畜。陈巴尔虎旗牧工图布信，解放前当了十多年牧工，仍穷得连一只羊也没有。因为提高了工资和得到人民政府的扶助，现在他已有三百多只羊和三十头牛、马，还添置了九辆大车、一个新毡蒙古包。牧工们生活改善后，生产积极性普遍提高，牧养的牲畜也迅速增多。陈巴尔虎旗的牧主达西德勒格尔，过去牲畜增殖很慢，由于合理地解决了工资问题，现在各种牲畜比五年前增加了九倍多。
    各牧区并进行了改造旧“苏鲁克”制度的工作
  （苏鲁克是蒙语，就是牧主把畜群交给牧民放牧，付出一定报酬）。过去牧主给苏鲁克户的报酬，只是允许剪羊毛和挤奶，没有工资，所以苏鲁克户不愿好好牧养，牲畜繁殖率和成活率很低。为了改变这种情况，各盟经过人民代表会议讨论，或者由牧主和苏鲁克户双方协商，规定苏鲁克户除了羊毛、奶食品以外，每年并分得一部分仔畜。这样按照自愿和两利的原则改变旧“苏鲁克”制度，使牲畜繁殖得很快。新巴尔虎左翼旗牧主毛拉玛的牲畜，在一九五二年就已比一九四五年刚解放时增加了整整两倍。他放给胡和勒泰畜牧业生产互助组苏鲁克羊三百二十只，规定每年分得一百六十只羊羔，四年后可净得六百四十只羊，互助组也可得羊四百多只。
