Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Shanxi Provinces
Actively Establish Primary Grain Markets

[Our Newspaper] Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces have already established 642 state-run grain markets, including: Shaanxi 477, Gansu 125, Ningxia 28, and Qinghai 12.

After the establishment of state-run grain markets in various regions, grain transactions have gradually become active. For example, in Ningxia, from January to April 25th of this year, farmers exchanged approximately 7 million jin of grain amongst themselves. This has primarily helped farmers in various regions who have surplus grain after state unified purchase to turn dead grain into liquid capital, expand production investment, and create conditions for a bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops this year. Secondly, farmers can exchange goods and adjust varieties in the grain market, partially solving the difficulties of food rations or livestock feed on their own, playing an auxiliary role in the country's grain supply work.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 18th: While Shanxi Province is carrying out planned grain purchases and actively supplying grain to grain-deficient households in rural areas, it is also establishing rural primary grain markets to facilitate farmers' adjustments of surpluses and deficiencies and exchange of grain seeds, in order to invigorate the rural economy. From February to mid-April, the province established a total of 603 rural primary grain markets directly led by the state and entrusted to supply and marketing cooperatives, without the participation of private merchants. At the Yuwu Township grain market in Tunliu County, farmers exchanged and the state purchased a total of more than 46,000 jin of grain over five market days. Transactions of other means of production in the market were very active. Farmers purchased 120 head of livestock, 57 pigs, and hundreds of pieces of farm equipment on one market day. The turnover of the Yuwu Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in March increased by 58% compared with February. After the establishment of many rural primary grain markets in Shanxi Province, the cooked food and non-staple food industries in various regions purchased the raw materials they needed from the grain market, and their business increased compared to before. In addition to some grain being exchanged among farmers in the rural primary grain markets, some farmers also request the state to purchase the grain they sell. In 75 rural primary grain markets in 8 counties including Wuxiang and Tunliu, supply and marketing cooperatives purchased more than 99,000 jin of grain on behalf of the state from mid-March to early April. In three market days in the Duihou Township of Xia County and the Daning Township of Yangcheng County grain markets, the state also purchased more than 2,700 jin of oilseeds and 1,050 jin of cotton.

    陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、山西五省
    积极建立初级粮食市场
   【本报讯】陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏四省已经建立了国家粮食市场六百四十二处，计：陕西四百七十七处、甘肃一百二十五处、宁夏二十八处、青海十二处。
    各地国家粮食市场建立以后，粮食交易逐渐活跃。如宁夏各县粮食市场从今年一月到四月二十五日，农民即互相调剂粮食约七百万斤。这就首先帮助各地粮食统购后还有余粮的农民把死粮变成活钱，扩大了生产投资，给今年夏秋作物的丰收创造了条件。其次，农民在粮食市场上可以互通有无并进行品种调剂，部分地自行解决了口粮或牲畜饲料的困难，对国家的粮食供应工作起了辅助作用。
   【新华社太原十八日电】山西省在粮食计划收购和对农村缺粮户积极进行粮食供应的同时，建立农村初级粮食市场，便于农民调剂有无和进行粮种互换，以活跃农村经济。从二月份开始到四月中旬，全省共建立由国家直接领导和委托供销合作社代办的、没有私商参加的农村初级粮食市场六百零三个。屯留县余吾乡粮食市场在五个集日上，农民互相调剂以及国家收购粮食共达四万六千多斤，市场上其他生产资料的交易很活跃，农民在一个集日上购买的牲口有一百二十头、猪五十七口和数百件农具。余吾乡供销合作社三月份营业额较二月份增加了百分之五十八。山西省许多农村初级粮食市场建立后，各地熟食业、副食业从粮食市场上买到了所需的原料，营业较前增多。在农村初级粮食市场上除部分粮食由农民互相调剂外，还有一部分农民出售的粮食要求国家收购。武乡、屯留等八县七十五个农村初级粮食市场上，从三月中旬到四月上旬，供销合作社就代国家收购粮食九万九千多斤。夏县堆后乡、阳城县大宁乡两个粮食市场的三个集日，国家还收购油籽二千七百多斤，棉花一千零五十斤。
