    Anshan and Shenyang traffic police are actively improving traffic management
    The Anshan Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, adapting to the needs of urban construction, has actively improved traffic management, which has played a significant role in ensuring traffic order and facilitating transportation.
    With the rapid development of industrial construction in Anshan, transportation tasks are becoming increasingly heavy. The annual transportation volume in 1953 increased nearly five times compared to 1950. In addition to motor vehicles, a large number of mule-drawn carts and human-powered carts are also undertaking transportation tasks. The city's population, especially workers, also increased nearly doubled in 1953 compared to 1950. Due to the improvement of people's living standards, more and more farmers are entering the city, and more people are riding bicycles within the city. This has led to a rapid increase in urban traffic flow. Moreover, vehicles and pedestrians are mostly concentrated on the main lines around Anshan Iron and Steel Company. During the rush hours for workers going to and from work and during the spring construction season, the number of vehicles and pedestrians suddenly increases dramatically. However, the city's roads are few and narrow, without pedestrian sidewalks, and there are many railway crossings, which are very inconvenient for driving.
    In order to solve this problem, the Anshan Municipal Public Security Bureau took the initiative to plan and adjust traffic times and disperse traffic flow. They sent people to the Urban Construction Committee, the transportation departments under Anshan Iron and Steel, and the transportation departments under the construction companies to understand the scale of the city's planned construction projects, the distribution areas, the amount of transportation and its sources, construction time, types and number of transportation vehicles, and the necessary routes. Then, in accordance with the principle of maximizing transportation turnover, the city's roads were appropriately adjusted, and transportation lines were planned to become two-way or one-way streets, thereby eliminating and avoiding the concentration and stagnation of traffic flow and ensuring smooth transportation and traffic safety.
    After adjusting traffic routes and dispersing traffic flow, the Anshan Municipal Public Security Bureau also appropriately allocated traffic police forces based on the sudden increase in traffic flow during daily rush hours and annual construction seasons. First, traffic command posts were set up inside Anshan Iron and Steel Company to directly serve the production and transportation of Anshan Iron and Steel; "time posts" were set up on the main traffic lines used by workers going to and from work, and "seasonal posts" were set up on the particularly busy traffic lines during the construction season, specializing in maintaining traffic order during rush hours and the construction season. These traffic police officers completely adjust their work and rest times according to the time when workers go to and from work. This accurately and effectively ensures transportation traffic order and the safety of workers.
    Anshan traffic police also pay attention to conducting traffic safety publicity and education to the masses and drivers at any time and place, using actual examples to tell them the harm of violating traffic rules to themselves and the country, as well as common knowledge of observing traffic rules, and cultivating the habit of the masses to observe traffic rules. For general violations of traffic rules by drivers and pedestrians, they are released immediately after appropriate explanation and education, allowing them to continue their tasks, and the specific details of the violations are notified to their respective units for further criticism and education; those who repeatedly violate traffic rules, whose circumstances are serious, and who refuse to be educated are given appropriate punishment to sternly enforce traffic rules and educate the broad masses.
    The Sanwei Road traffic post in Shenyang is the transportation hub of the city. On average, about 2,400 vehicles of various types pass through every hour, but the streets here are very narrow. The north-south branch lines are only six meters wide, and the east-west main lines are only twelve meters wide. This situation adds a lot of difficulties to traffic management. If, purely for the safety of vehicles and pedestrians, the speed of vehicles is restricted too slowly, and vehicles are mechanically released one by one, or branch lines are released before main lines, it will cause a large amount of stagnation and waiting for vehicles and pedestrians, which will reduce transportation efficiency and cause incalculable losses to the fuel and parts of motor vehicles. In order to solve this contradiction of both facilitating transportation and ensuring traffic safety, all traffic police officers at Sanwei Road have painstakingly researched and created the experience of "fast vehicles do not stop, slow vehicles do not pile up, and pedestrians do not wait," so that motor vehicles, animal-drawn vehicles, human-powered vehicles, and pedestrians can pass continuously; vehicles and pedestrians on branch lines and main lines can pass at the same time, overcoming the phenomenon of "fast vehicles slow down, slow vehicles pile up, and pedestrians wait," effectively improving the transportation efficiency of vehicles. In the eleven months since May 1953, no accidents have occurred, which has won praise from more than seventy agencies, factories, and the general public in Shenyang.
    The reason why the Sanwei Road traffic post can achieve "fast vehicles do not stop, slow vehicles do not pile up, and pedestrians do not wait" is that they have taken the initiative to understand the transportation tasks of the production and transportation departments, avoided the blindness and passivity in traffic command, and have a clear understanding of the situation. They often go to relevant agencies, factories, construction sites, and transportation departments to understand the number of trips to be made, the time, and the direction of travel, and then direct the release of vehicles according to the importance and urgency of the vehicle transportation tasks. For a small number of transportation vehicles that have not been contacted in advance and are temporarily discovered on the road, especially transportation vehicles from other places that are not familiar with the local street environment, they promptly find drivers to understand their transportation plans. For example, once they found a batch of unfamiliar large trucks loaded with steel bars, which were to be driven to a nearby construction site. The police officer serving as deputy quickly stepped forward to understand their dispatch situation, told them about the local street topography and matters that should be paid attention to, which not only facilitated the command, but also gave the drivers great help.
    They are able to achieve "fast vehicles do not stop, slow vehicles do not pile up, and pedestrians do not wait" because they have also carefully investigated the performance of various vehicles and flexibly direct traffic according to their performance. For example, they have figured out: motorcycles are fast and easy to fall over when braking suddenly, and it is difficult to start the engine; transportation trucks are prone to damage parts when braking suddenly, waste gasoline, and start slowly. In addition, during emergency braking, loaded vehicles are slower than lightly loaded vehicles, large vehicles are slower than small vehicles, Japanese-made vehicles are slower than Soviet-made vehicles, trolleybuses are slower than cars, and horse-drawn carriages are slower than motor vehicles. When directing traffic, they take care of the characteristics of the above-mentioned vehicles and direct them flexibly. For example, when large trucks and motorcycles pass through the platform at the same time, motorcycles are released first, and then trucks are released, which not only does not delay the passage of trucks, but also avoids the danger of motorcycles falling over during emergency stops.
    They also thought of many methods in traffic command. In order for vehicles and pedestrians on main lines and branch lines to pass at the same time, the main post and the deputy post cooperate closely and direct the release separately when the vehicle driving directions on the two lines do not conflict and safety is ensured. In addition, they generally do not use traffic light command methods much, because although this method is relatively simple, it cannot release vehicles in all directions at the same time. When traffic conditions tend to be tense during daily rush hours for workers and students going to and from work, they use megaphones to assist in commanding traffic, helping the elderly and young, and helping heavily loaded handcarts to cross the streets. Every time after it rains or snows, they use their rest time to repair roads to avoid accidents caused by muddy roads and easy slippage.
    The Sanwei Road traffic post also pays attention to educating and mobilizing the masses to consciously maintain and abide by traffic order. They often conduct traffic safety publicity and education to the masses, explaining the close relationship between traffic safety and the vital interests of the masses and the country's economic construction. They organize the tricycles and handcarts in the vicinity, set up fixed parking lots, and often introduce traffic conditions and traffic management knowledge to them. This not only overcomes the phenomenon of tricycle workers wandering around and obstructing traffic, but also cultivates them to become voluntary propagandists for traffic safety education to the broad masses and becomes a powerful assistant in actively assisting the traffic police to maintain order. In addition, the traffic police also established close relationships with nearby agencies, factories, and schools, and through the administrative leadership of these departments, conducted traffic safety education for cadres, workers, and students, overcoming the phenomenon of people running around and obstructing traffic when going to and from work and school.

    鞍山、沈阳交通民警积极改进交通管理工作
    鞍山市人民政府公安局适应城市建设的需要，积极改进交通管理工作，对保证交通秩序、便利交通运输起了很大作用。
    鞍山市随着工业建设的飞速发展，交通运输任务也一天天繁重起来。一九五三年的全年运输量比一九五○年增加将近五倍，担负运输任务的除机动车外，还有大量的骡马大车、人力货车。市内人口特别是职工，一九五三年比一九五○年也增加将近一倍。由于人民生活水平的提高，农民进城和市内骑自行车的人也越来越多。这就使得城市的交通流动量迅速加大。而且，车辆和行人大都集中在鞍山钢铁公司周围的几条主要线路上，每天职工上下班和每年春季基本建设施工季节，车辆和行人就骤然大量增加。可是，市内道路却又少又狭窄，没有行人便道，铁路卡口很多，很不便利行驶。
    鞍山市公安局为解决这一问题，主动地规划和调整了行车时间，疏散了交通流量。他们派人到城市建设委员会、鞍钢所属运输部门、工程建筑公司所属运输部门，了解了全市计划建设工程的规模、分布地区、运输数量及来源、施工时间、运输车辆种类及数量、必经的路线等，然后按照尽量提高运输周转率的原则，将市内的道路加以适当的调整，有计划地划运输线成为双行线或单行线，从而消除和避免了交通流量的集中和停滞现象，保证了运输畅通和交通安全。
    在调整行车线路、疏散交通流量后，鞍山市公安局又根据职工每天上下班和每年施工季节交通流量突然增加的情况，适当地配置了交通民警力量。首先在鞍山钢铁公司内部设置了交通指挥岗，直接为鞍钢的生产和运输服务；在职工上下班经过的主要交通线路上，设立“时间岗”，在施工季节特别繁忙的交通路线上设立“季节岗”，专门维持上下班和施工季节的交通秩序。这些交通民警完全是随着职工上下班的时间来规定自己的作息时间。这样就准确有效地保障了运输交通秩序和职工的安全。
    鞍山市交通民警还注意了随时随地对群众和驾驶人员进行交通安全的宣传教育工作，用实际事例告诉他们违犯交通规则对自己和对国家的害处，以及遵守交通规则的普通知识，培养群众遵守交通规则的习惯。他们对驾驶人员和行人的一般性违犯交通规则的行为，则在进行适当的解释和教育后，立即放行，使其继续执行任务，事后将违犯规则的具体情况通知其所在单位，进一步给以批评教育；对那些多次违犯交通规则，情节严重、屡教不改者则给予适当的处分，以严肃交通规则，教育广大群众。
    沈阳市三纬路交通岗，是全市交通运输的枢纽，平均每小时约通过各种车辆二千四百辆，但这里街道却很窄，南北支线只有六公尺宽，东西干线也只有十二公尺宽。这种情况给交通管理工作增加了很多困难。如果单纯为了车辆和行人的安全，而把行车速度限制得太慢，机械地逐辆放行或放行了支线再放行干线，就会造成车辆、行人的大量停滞和等待，既降低了运输效率，又使机动车的燃料和机件受到难以计算的损耗。为了解决这个既要便利交通运输又要保证交通安全的矛盾，三纬路全体交通民警经过苦心钻研，创造出“快车不停、慢车不堆、行人不等”的经验，使机动车、畜力车、人力车和行人不间断地通行；使支线干线的车辆行人同时通行，克服了“快车慢、慢车堆、行人等”的现象，有效地提高了车辆的运输效率。从一九五三年五月以来的十一个月中未发生任何事故，博得了沈阳市七十多个机关工厂和广大市民的称赞。
    三纬路交通岗能够做到“快车不停、慢车不堆、行人不等”，是因为他们主动地了解了生产运输部门的运输任务，避免了交通指挥中的盲目、被动状态，做到了心中有数。他们经常到有关机关、工厂、建筑工地、运输部门，去了解准备出车的次数、时间和往来方向，然后按照车辆运输任务的轻重缓急，分别指挥放行。对于少数事先未取得联系、在路上临时发现的运输车辆，尤其是不熟悉本地街道环境、由外地来的运输车辆，他们就随时找驾驶人员了解他们的运输计划。如有一次他们发现了一批满载钢筋的生疏的大卡车，要开往附近的一个工地，担任副岗的民警就很快上前了解了他们的出车情况，告诉他们本地的街道地形和应注意的事项，不但便利了指挥，也给了驾驶人员们很大的帮助。
    他们能够做到“快车不停、慢车不堆、行人不等”，还因为细致地调查研究了各种车辆的性能，并根据它们的性能，灵活地指挥通行。如他们摸清了：摩托车速度快，紧急停车容易倒，“踩火”起车费劲；运输载重卡车在紧急停车时机件容易损坏，浪费汽油，起车慢。另外，在紧急停车时，载重车慢于载轻车，大型车慢于小型车，原日本产车慢于苏联产车，无轨电车慢于汽车，马车慢于机动车。在指挥时就照顾上述各种车辆的特点，灵活指挥。例如大卡车和摩托车同时通过岗台时，就先放行摩托车，然后放行卡车，这样不但不耽误卡车的通行，又避免了摩托车急停时倒车的危险。
    在交通指挥方法上，他们也想了很多办法。为了干线和支线的车辆行人同时通行，在两线车辆行驶方向不发生矛盾、确保安全的情况下，正岗和副岗之间密切配合，分别指挥放行。此外，他们一般不多采用红绿灯指挥法，因为这种办法虽然比较省事，但却不能同时放行各方面的车辆。在每天职工上下班、学生上下学交通情况趋于紧张时，他们就用喊话筒配合指挥，扶老携幼，帮助载量较重的手推车通过街道。每逢下雨、降雪后，他们就利用休息时间修理道路，以避免因道路泥泞、容易滑倒而发生事故的现象。
    三纬路交通岗还注意了教育和发动群众，自觉地维持和遵守交通秩序。他们经常向群众进行交通安全的宣传教育，说明交通安全与群众的切身利害、与国家的经济建设的密切关系。他们把附近的三轮车和手推车都组织起来，设置了固定的停车场，并经常向他们介绍交通情况和交通管理知识，这样不但克服了三轮工人到处游荡、妨碍交通的现象，还培养他们成为向广大群众进行交通安全教育的义务宣传员，成了积极协助交通民警维持秩序的有力助手。此外，交通民警还建立了与附近机关、工厂、学校的密切关系，通过这些部门的行政领导方面，向干部、职工、学生进行交通安全的教育，克服了人们上下班、上下学时乱走乱跑，妨碍交通的现象。
