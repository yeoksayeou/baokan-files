(Our Wuhan Dispatch, May 14th) Sixty state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in the Central South region exceeded April's national production plan by 104.3 percent. Twenty-three major products, including electricity, raw coal, pig iron, steel, steel ingots, rolled steel products, internal combustion engines, electric motors, metal cutting machine tools, cement, sugar, and cotton yarn, also exceeded their production plans. Among them, several products that hold an important position in the country's output, such as sugar, reached 104.22 percent of the plan, and cement reached 102.21 percent. The factories and mines were able to exceed their production plans mainly because the factory and mine workers launched a production increase and conservation labor emulation drive, continuously improved production tools, and increased labor productivity. For example, Huang Qingyan, a fitter at the state-owned Wuhan Power Machine Factory, used waste materials to make a spring grinding machine, replacing the previous manual operation and increasing production efficiency by 72 times. The factory originally needed one hour and twenty minutes to machine one steel ball for a turntable part, but after improving the tools, it could machine twenty pieces in seven hours. Other factories and mines, such as Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, State-owned Zini Sugar Factory, and State-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, also continuously improved production tools, increased labor efficiency, and exceeded the national plan. Secondly, strengthening planning management was also one of the reasons for the factories and mines to exceed the plan.
    (Our Shanghai Dispatch, May 13th) Most state-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai exceeded April's national plan. According to statistics from seventy-seven state-owned and joint state-private factories in the iron and steel, machinery, electrical machinery, shipbuilding, textile, and chemical industries, seventy-one factories exceeded April's output value plan. Among them, the twenty factories in Shanghai under the East China Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building averaged 107.2 percent of April's output value plan; the thirty-four factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau averaged 107.68 percent of April's output value plan; and the eight factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company averaged 110.36 percent of April's output value plan. All eighty-four major products of twenty-six hardware, chemical and other factories were completed according to plan. All factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau, except for individual silk factories, exceeded April's production plan. The percentage of first-grade cloth in each textile factory increased by an average of 0.19 percent compared with the first quarter, and the average amount of cotton used per yarn and thread was reduced by 1.18 kilograms compared with March.
    In April, workers in Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private factories enthusiastically launched a competition to welcome the "May 1st" Labor Day, and many new records emerged. Sheng Li, a labor model at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, improved the diamond knife edge, so that the turning tool can turn the plane, and can turn the outer circle, and can turn the groove, which greatly improved the cutting efficiency. For example, the "gearbox" work, which originally took eighteen hours to complete, can be completed in seven hours. The turners Zhang Zhixiang and Mi A'gen adopted high-speed cutting and changed from using two knives to using four knives for cutting. They completed the production task equivalent to two months on April 23. Under the leadership of labor model Jin Shanjia, the C shift in the converter workshop of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Factory adopted the method of close cooperation among the four parts of "crane, iron making, steel casting, and in front of the furnace," creating a new record of increasing the number of steel output furnaces per shift from 35 to 38. Ye Zhengchang, a fitter at the Shanghai Shipyard, improved the tools, increasing the original daily output of eight pipe screws to more than two hundred per day. Yi Shijuan, a famous labor model at the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, and her team have reduced the doffing stop time in April from about 40 seconds to 35 seconds each time, which can increase the country's production of 182.78 pounds of fine yarn per month. These have played a certain role in completing the April plan.
    Now, the workers in Shanghai factories are further launching labor emulation drives to strive to complete the second quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 13th) The major state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have exceeded April's output value plan by an average of 2.94 percent. Thirty-six factories and mines have completed or exceeded the plan. The workers in the factories in Baotou City launched a heated inter-factory competition in April, and the city's factories have exceeded the national plan by an average of 8.84 percent for the whole month. The best-performing products are building materials such as refractory bricks, low-voltage electrical porcelain, lime, cement tiles, cement ridge tiles, and cast iron pipes, which are now being continuously supplied to various construction sites and nearby exploration areas. The eleven factories in Hohhot were also able to complete the plan evenly on a ten-day basis in April.

    中南区和上海市许多国营及公私合营厂矿
    超额完成四月份国家生产计划
    内蒙古主要厂矿上月平将超额完成计划百分之二点九四
    【本报武汉十四日电】中南区国营及公私合营的六十个厂矿以百分之一百零四点三超额完成了四月份国家生产计划。电力、原煤、生铁、钢、钢锭、钢压延品、内燃机、电动机、金属切削机床、水泥、糖、棉纱等二十三种主要产品也都超额完成了生产计划。其中产量占全国重要地位的几种产品如糖完成计划百分之一百零四点二二，水泥完成百分之一百零二点二一。各厂矿能超额完成生产计划，主要是因为厂矿职工展开了增产节约劳动竞赛，不断改良生产工具，提高了劳动生产率。如国营武汉动力机厂配钳工黄庆炎利用废料制成磨簧机，代替了过去的手工操作，使生产效率提高七十二倍。该厂原来车一粒转盘零件钢珠需一小时二十分钟，改良工具后七小时就能车二十粒。其他如广州通用机器厂、国营紫泥糖厂、国营武汉第一棉纺织厂等厂矿，都在不断改良生产工具之下，提高了劳动效率，超额完成了国家计划。其次各厂矿加强了计划管理，也是超额完成计划的原因之一。
    【本报上海十三日电】上海大部分国营和公私合营工厂超额完成四月份国家计划。据钢铁、机械、电机、船舶、纺织、化工等七十七个国营和公私合营工厂的统计，有七十一个工厂超额完成了四月份产值计划。其中中央第一机械工业部华东办事处所属上海二十个工厂，平均完成四月份产值计划百分之一零七点二；华东纺织管理局所属三十四个工厂平均完成四月份产值计划百分之一零七点六八；华东钢铁公司所属八个厂平均完成四月份产值计划百分之一一零点三六。五金、化工等二十六个工厂的八十四种主要产品，全部按计划完成。华东纺织管理局各厂除个别绢丝厂外，全部超额完成了四月份产量计划。各纺织厂的正布率较第一季度平均提高百分之零点一九，每件纱、线用棉量平均较三月份降低一点一八公斤。
    四月份，上海国营、公私合营各厂的工人热烈展开了迎接“五一”劳动节的竞赛，出现了不少新纪录。上海机床厂劳动模范盛利改进了金钢刀刀口，使车刀既能车平面，又能车外圆，并可以车槽子，大大提高了切削效率。如原来需要十八个小时才能完成的“齿轮箱”工作，在七个小时内就可完成。车工章致祥、米阿根两人采用高速切削和由使用两把刀改用四把刀切削，他们在四月二十三日即完成了相等于两个月的生产任务。上海钢铁公司第一厂转炉车间丙班工人在劳动模范金善嘉的带动下，采用“行车、化铁、铸钢、炉前”四部分工人密切合作的办法，创造了该厂每班出钢炉数由三十五炉增加到三十八炉的新纪录。上海船厂钳工叶正昌，由于改进了工具，使原来每天做八根管子螺丝提高到每天二百多根。国营上海第二棉纺织厂著名的劳动模范裔式娟和她的小组，四月份落纱停台时间已做到由每次四十秒钟左右降低到三十五秒钟，这样每月可为国家增产一百八十二点七八磅细纱。这些对完成四月份计划都起了一定的作用。
    现在，上海各厂工人正进一步展开劳动竞赛，争取提前完成第二季度生产任务。
    【新华社呼和浩特十三日电】内蒙古自治区国营和地方国营主要厂矿已平均超额百分之二点九四完成了四月份产值计划。完成或超额完成计划的有三十六个厂矿。包头市各厂职工四月份展开了火热的厂际竞赛，全月平均超额百分之八点八四完成了国家计划。完成最好的产品是耐火砖、低压电瓷、石灰、水泥片瓦、水泥脊瓦、铸铁管等建筑器材，这些产品现在正源源不断地供应各个建筑工地和附近的勘探地区。呼和浩特的十一个工厂，四月份也已能逐旬均衡地完成计划。
