Hubei Province's high-level and mid-level cadres participating in theoretical study began to study Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in early May. The entire chapter is divided into three topics for study: the first topic is "Focusing on the Development of Heavy Industry and Solving the Problem of Industrialization Funds"; the second topic is "The Guiding Principles of Agricultural Collectivization"; and the third topic is "The Adoption of the First Five-Year Plan and Socialist Labor Emulation." In addition to studying the prescribed documents, the intermediate-level groups will also study the following documents: "On the Economic Situation in the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy," "On the Grain Front," "Lenin and the Question of Alliance with Middle Peasants," and "The Year of the Great Turn."

The Propaganda Departments of the various local Party committees in Hubei Province have made specific arrangements one after another based on the notice from the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department. The Propaganda Department of the Jingzhou Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while summarizing the achievements of the general line study and commending learning models, also arranged for the study of Chapter Ten of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). The provincial directly affiliated organs decided that Qiu Jingshan, Director of the Provincial People's Government's Industry Department, Zhang Ruogu, Deputy Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department, and Zhuang Guo, Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Government's Finance Committee, and other comrades would lecture the intermediate-level group on separate topics. Shashi City and the directly affiliated organs of Jingzhou Prefecture are preparing to provide comprehensive explanations and topic-based lectures to cadres, making it easier for intermediate-level cadres to understand the central content of the entire chapter during study and discussion.

    湖北省参加理论学习的高级组和中级组的干部，五月初已陆续开始学习“联共（布）党史”第十章。全章划分三个题目进行学习：第一题为“着重发展重工业和解决工业化的资金问题”；第二题为“农业集体化底方针问题”；第三题为“第一个五年计划的采取和社会主义劳动竞赛”。中级组除学习规定的文件外，还要学习下列几个文件：“论苏联经济状况和党底政策”、“在粮食战线上”、“列宁与联合中农问题”和“大转变的一年”。
    湖北省各地党委宣传部根据省委宣传部通知先后作了具体布置。中共荆州地委宣传部在总结总路线学习的成果、表扬学习模范的同时，结合布置了联共（布）党史第十章的学习。省直属机关决定由省人民政府工业厅厅长邱静山、省委农村工作部副部长张若谷、省人民政府财委副主任庄果等同志分题给中级组讲授。沙市市和荆州专区直属机关准备向干部作全面讲解和按题讲授，使中级组干部在学习讨论时更易于了解整个章节的中心内容。
