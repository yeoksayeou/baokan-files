Xinhua News Agency:

Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee’s officials, both monastic and secular, are earnestly studying the ethnic policies section of the Common Program and the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, enhancing their patriotic thinking and strengthening unity within the ethnic group. Officials from the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee who had visited Beijing and the inland areas often used their personal experiences and the happy lives of fraternal ethnic groups in various autonomous regions to illustrate the greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies during study and discussion sessions. During the discussions, officials said: Our Tibetan ethnic group should unite, like small streams converging into the great waters of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, so that we can navigate boats and irrigate the land, and with the help of the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, build a happy life. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni sent telegrams to each other, expressing that they would constantly encourage their subordinate officials to study diligently so that, with the help of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, they could thoroughly implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet as soon as possible and play a greater role in the great cause of building a new Tibet and consolidating national defense.

    学习共同纲领中的民族政策
    据新华社讯：西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的各级僧俗官员，认真学习共同纲领中的民族政策部分和关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，提高了爱国主义思想，加强了民族内部的团结。班禅堪布会议厅委员会中曾经到北京和内地参观过的官员，在学习讨论会上经常用亲身体会和亲眼看见的各民族自治区兄弟民族的幸福生活，来说明毛主席民族政策的伟大。在讨论会上，官员们说：我们西藏民族应该团结起来，像小溪一样汇合成雅鲁藏布江的大水，然后才能行船和灌溉，才能在祖国各兄弟民族人民和进藏人民解放军的帮助下，建设幸福的生活。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼互相致电表示：要经常勉励所属官员努力学习，以便在进藏人民解放军的帮助下，早日彻底实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，在建设新西藏和巩固祖国国防的伟大事业中，发挥更大的力量。
