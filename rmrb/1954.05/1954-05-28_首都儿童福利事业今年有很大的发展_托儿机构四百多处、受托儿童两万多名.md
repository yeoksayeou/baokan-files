Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: Beijing now has 435 childcare institutions, including nurseries, childcare stations, and infant rooms, an increase of 132 over last year. More than 20,300 children are being cared for, an increase of more than 4,600 over last year. The development of childcare institutions in government agencies, factories, and enterprises is particularly rapid, with 90 facilities developed in industrial and mining enterprises alone. The People's Government is concerned about the health of children. The number of maternal and child health stations in Beijing has increased by four compared to last year, and the equipment is more complete than before. In the western suburbs of the capital, a children's hospital with 600 beds is under construction and will open within the year. Due to the widespread promotion of modern midwifery and the strengthening of infant care, the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. According to first-quarter statistics, the mortality rate from tetanus neonatorum has been reduced to 0.48 per thousand. In order to prevent children from getting sick and to raise them well, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau and the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation held a measles prevention exhibition this year and printed a large number of pamphlets on measles prevention and treatment, conducting extensive publicity among mothers.

    With the development of various childcare organizations, the ranks of childcare workers have also grown stronger than before. There are now more than 9,800 childcare workers in the city. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has been running nursery training classes regularly since 1951. It has run nine sessions to date, training more than 1,000 nursery workers. This year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau also started a nursery training class, with more than 200 students currently studying. To make children's diets more nutritionally sound, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau and various districts have also trained a large number of nutritionists and cooks in various childcare organizations this year.

    Children's playgrounds have been universally established in the capital's parks, and the equipment in the playgrounds is constantly being increased. The area of the children's playground in Beihai Park has been expanded by a quarter this year. Last autumn, a new children's playground was built next to Taoranting. A small children's park has also been built in Houhai, with flowers and trees planted everywhere, and various sports equipment is also available. A newly opened children's playground in the Temple of Heaven is being actively built. Workers are rushing to make wave logs, slides, rocking horses and other sports equipment, preparing to open it before "June 1st" [International Children's Day].

    首都儿童福利事业今年有很大的发展
    托儿机构四百多处、受托儿童两万多名
    【新华社二十七日讯】北京市现在已有托儿所、托儿站、乳儿室等各种托儿机构四百三十五处，比去年增加一百三十二处；受托儿童有两万零三百多名，比去年增加了四千六百多名。其中机关、工厂、企业托儿机构的发展尤其迅速，仅工矿企业中就发展到九十处。人民政府关心儿童的健康，北京市的妇幼保健站比去年增加了四处，设备也比以前完备了。在首都西郊，一座设有六百张床位的儿童医院正在加紧施工，年内即可开幕。由于新法接生的普遍推广和对婴儿护理工作的加强，婴儿死亡率已有很大降低。据第一季度统计，新生婴儿破伤风死亡率已降低到千分之零点四八。为了防止孩子们生病，把孩子养好，北京市人民政府公共卫生局和北京市民主妇女联合会，今年曾举办了预防麻疹展览会，并印制了大量防治麻疹的小册子，向母亲们进行了广泛宣传。
    随着各种托儿组织的发展，保育工作者的队伍也比以前壮大了。现在全市共有保育工作人员九千八百多人。北京市人民政府民政局从一九五一年起就定期开办了保育员训练班，到现在已开办了九期，训练出一千多名保育员。今年北京市人民政府劳动局也开办了保育员训练班，有二百多名学员正在学习。为了使儿童的饮食更加合乎营养标准，今年北京市人民政府公共卫生局和各区还大批训练了各托儿组织内的营养员和炊事员。
    首都各公园内普遍设立了儿童运动场，场内设备不断增加。北海公园的儿童运动场场地今年扩大了四分之一。去年秋天，陶然亭边又修建了一处新的儿童运动场。后海也修建了一个小型儿童公园，里面遍栽花木，还设有各种运动器械。天坛新辟的一处儿童运动场正积极修建，工人们正在赶制浪木、滑梯、摇马等运动器械，准备在“六一”前开放。
