Xuzhou Vegetable Oil Factory Improves Soybean Oil Yield
Annual Output of Soybean Oil Can Increase by More Than 510,000 Jin
The local state-owned Xuzhou Vegetable Oil Factory has studied the advanced soybean oil extraction experience of Li Chuanjiang from the Lüda Oil and Grease General Factory, and the soybean oil yield has been significantly improved. Last year, the factory's oil yield was 11.13 percent. Currently, after initially promoting Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction experience, the average oil yield of soybeans with an oil content of 16.91 percent reaches 13.54 percent after being pressed by water-powered circular presses, creating the factory's highest record in history. If calculated based on the factory's production capacity, after the oil yield increases from 11.13 percent to 13.54 percent, the annual output of soybean oil can increase by 516,222 jin, worth 2.58 billion yuan; at the same time, 1,645 tons of soybeans can be saved annually.

    徐州植物油厂提高了大豆出油率
    全年可增产豆油五十一万多斤
    地方国营徐州植物油厂学习旅大油脂总厂李川江榨油先进经验，大豆的出油率已有了显著提高。去年该厂的出油率为百分之十一点一三，目前，经过初步推行李川江榨油经验后，含油百分之十六点九一的大豆，经水压式圆车的压榨，平均出油率达百分之十三点五四，创造了该厂历史上的最高纪录。如按该厂生产能力计算，出油率从百分之十一点一三提高到十三点五四后，全年可增产豆油五十一万六千二百二十二斤，价值二十五亿八千多万元；同时，全年又可节约大豆一千六百四十五吨。
