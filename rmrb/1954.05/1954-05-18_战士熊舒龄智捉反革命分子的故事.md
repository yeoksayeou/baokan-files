The story of how warrior Xiong Shuling wisely captured counter-revolutionary elements.

Xiong Shuling, a student and member of the Communist Youth League at a certain school of the People's Liberation Army, had his vacation come to an end. He was about to return to school from his hometown – Tianzhen County, Shanxi. On this day, the young people in the village, about the same age as Xiong Shuling, all came to his house to talk with him. They talked about battle stories, agricultural production cooperatives, and the just-concluded general election. Xiong Shuling's cousin, Xiong Yanling, said, "This general election was really great. Good people were elected, and bad people were voted down. Everyone felt as happy as if two doors had been opened in their hearts." He suddenly asked Xiong Shuling, "Brother, have you heard anything about Pang Rubing's whereabouts?" Xiong Shuling couldn't remember for a moment, and said somewhat vaguely, "Pang Rubing?" Xiong Yanling said, "Yes! That counter-revolutionary, that troublemaker, how could you forget him so quickly?"

Xiong Shuling remembered. He had seen Pang Rubing eight years ago. He was of medium height, with a round face and narrow eyes like slits. However, at that time, the villagers called Pang Rubing the grain assistant. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries occupied Zhangjiakou and attacked the Shanxi Liberated Area, and Tianzhen County was occupied by the Chiang bandits. The next time Xiong Shuling saw Pang Rubing, Pang Rubing was wearing the uniform of a Chiang bandit security team officer, strutting down the street. After that, Xiong Shuling joined the People's Liberation Army, and he knew nothing more about Pang Rubing.

Xiong Shuling asked, "What bad things did Pang Rubing actually do?" Everyone answered noisily, "He made the people in our area suffer terribly! How come he hasn't been caught yet?" Xiong Yanling said, "Since the Chiang bandit army occupied Zhangjiakou, Pang Rubing has been a loyal lackey of the Chiang bandits. He led the enemy to seize twelve large guns, one light machine gun, two boxes of grenades, and twelve barrels of gasoline that the local people's government had hidden in the walls; he led the enemy to arrest Gao Kede, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Gujiawan Village at the time, and after severely beating Gao Kede, he imprisoned him until our army liberated Tianzhen County, when Gao Kede was released. He also led the enemy to arrest Jia Ying, the district chief of the Third District at the time... Because Pang Rubing had rendered meritorious service to the Chiang bandits, he was promoted from clerk to lieutenant officer in less than a year, becoming a thorn in the side of the local people." Xiong Yanling paused and said, "During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, everyone looked for Pang Rubing. During this general election, the villagers mentioned this 'counter-revolutionary' again. It's just that this guy is nowhere to be found. Some people say that he died when the People's Liberation Army attacked Tianzhen."

Someone said angrily, "It's too cheap for him. It would be good if we could capture him alive and hold a public trial!"

Xiong Shuling said, "It doesn't matter. As long as he's still alive, he won't be able to escape. The people are a dragnet. Sooner or later, he will be brought to justice."

The next morning, Xiong Shuling set out on his journey back. The train broke through the bitter cold and sped towards the northeast. The carriage was hot and stuffy. Xiong Shuling sat for a day and a night, and only when the train passed through Shenyang did he buy a sleeper berth. He leaned against the wall of the carriage and chatted with the deputy platoon leader who was also returning to the team, recounting the many new things he had seen along the way. At this time, four people came in, one of whom, speaking with a Shanxi accent, laughed loudly and said, "We're almost there, why are we still sitting in the sleeper?" Another said, "It's more spacious here than in the front!" Xiong Shuling looked over at the sound of the voice and saw that the first person to speak was wearing a blue uniform and a blue woolen cap, with a chubby round face and narrow eyes. Xiong Shuling's heart skipped a beat, and he thought: He looks familiar, where have I seen him before? Coincidentally, the four people chose to sit diagonally opposite Xiong Shuling. Xiong Shuling saw that the round-faced man seemed to have a short gun hidden in his arms. Xiong Shuling did not let this fleeting thought pass. He secretly glanced at him a few more times, carefully scrutinized him, and then suddenly realized: Isn't this Pang Rubing, who has been missing for many years? Afraid that he was mistaken, he took the opportunity to ask the round-faced man, "Judging from your accent, you're from Shanxi. We're fellow villagers. What's your name?" The guy sized up Xiong Shuling slightly, and then frankly replied, "My name is Pang!" After saying that, he turned his head and talked to his companions about other things.

Xiong Shuling was considering how to further confirm this guy's current identity. The rumbling of the speeding train reminded him of what the guy had just said, "We're almost there." Did they mean they were getting off at the next stop – Siping? This was a rare opportunity. If they got off the train, it would not be easy to find clues. He decided to go to the police officers on the train to discuss the matter together.

The carriage was crowded with people. Xiong Shuling had just passed through two carriages when, coincidentally, another person traveling with the round-faced man also came over. Xiong Shuling quietly took that person aside and asked, "Comrade, what unit are you from?"

That person looked at Xiong Shuling strangely and asked, "What do you want?"

Xiong Shuling said, "It's important!"

That person said, "I'm a police officer."

Xiong Shuling asked, "What about that round-faced man from Shanxi?"
"He's a cadre from a certain municipal people's government."
"What's his name?"
"I heard it's Pang Zhiyun."

Xiong Shuling thought to himself, "This guy has even changed his name." That person said, "Comrade, tell me, what's the matter?" Xiong Shuling frowned, stared at that person's face, and didn't answer for a moment. That person understood what Xiong Shuling meant and said, "Comrade, don't worry, I'm a Communist Party member. I can take responsibility for anything." Only then did Xiong Shuling briefly tell him about Pang Rubing's past counter-revolutionary crimes. That person listened with slight surprise and doubt and said, "Is this true?" Xiong Shuling said, "Absolutely true!" That person said, "I'm from a certain county public security bureau. Pang Zhiyun and the other two people are from a certain municipal people's government. We're working on a case together. If it's really as you say, I can help you with this matter."

Xiong Shuling said, "This is not something to be taken lightly. I'm a witness!" They discussed it briefly and decided that Xiong Shuling would go to the police officers on the train, and that police officer would go back and keep an eye on Pang Rubing.

Xiong Shuling found the train police officer. He told him in detail about Pang Rubing's past crimes and said, "I am a revolutionary soldier, and I am responsible to the people. This counter-revolutionary element has infiltrated our people's government. He must be arrested immediately." Although the train police officer did not doubt the information provided by Xiong Shuling, he had to be very cautious about arresting a counter-revolutionary criminal. The train police officer solemnly asked him, "Comrade Xiong, are you sure you're not mistaken? If we arrest the wrong person, it will be very bad!" Xiong Shuling said, "No, I'm sure I recognize him. He looks exactly the same as before, just a little fatter. When I went home this time, the local people were all asking about his whereabouts. If we miss this opportunity, I'm afraid he will escape! If we arrest the wrong person, I will bear all the responsibility." In this way, they quickly reported to the Siping Railway Security Department; with the approval of the Railway Security Department, they decided to immediately arrest this counter-revolutionary criminal.

Xiong Shuling calmly returned to the sleeping car. At this time, Pang Rubing was talking to Xiong Shuling's deputy platoon leader, casually asking, "Which county in Shanxi is the comrade who went out to eat just now from?" Xiong Shuling stepped in, afraid that the deputy platoon leader would let something slip, and quickly replied, "He's from Gulou Street in Datong City. Comrade, what about you?" Pang Rubing didn't expect Xiong Shuling to come back at this time. He hesitated slightly and said unnaturally, "I'm also from Datong. I even went to middle school on Gulou Street for a year!" After saying that, he turned around again and kept looking at his watch. Xiong Shuling sat on his seat as if nothing had happened, and glanced sideways. Pang Rubing's face was pale, and the tip of his nose was sweating a little. Xiong Shuling was even more certain.

The train was about to enter Siping, and suddenly two train police officers came into the carriage. Then, two Mauser pistols were pointed at Pang Rubing. The train police officer shouted, "Don't move, put your hands up!" Pang Rubing pretended to be very calm at this time and said loudly, "What are you doing? Put the guns away, I'm a cadre of the people's government." The two people traveling with Pang Rubing were about to come over and question them because they didn't understand the situation. Xiong Shuling said, "No one is allowed to move! We want to arrest the counter-revolutionary criminal who goes by the name of Pang Zhiyun."

Pang Rubing's face turned white all of a sudden, his face was covered in sweat, and he slowly raised his hands. Xiong Shuling went up and disarmed Pang Rubing's pistol and tied him up. A weight was lifted from Xiong Shuling's heart. He took off his mask and said to Pang Rubing, "Do you still recognize me? Isn't Pang Rubing your real name?"

Pang Rubing stared blankly, lowered his head, and weakly uttered the word "Yes." At this time, the train was "wooing" its whistle and slowly stopped at Siping Station, and the passengers were crowding and clamoring to get off the train.

That night, after contacting a certain municipal people's government, Xiong Shuling accompanied the two train police officers back to a certain city, escorting Pang Rubing; the other three went to carry out their tasks. After arriving in a certain city, Xiong Shuling gave a detailed report to a section chief surnamed Zhao. They conducted a new and careful investigation, confirming that Pang Rubing was indeed a counter-revolutionary element who had been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for a long time. He concealed his history, and even joined the Communist Party, and was recently elected as a member of the Party branch committee. Recently, Pang Rubing had just been promoted, and two counter-revolutionary criminals under his supervision had escaped.

The cadres of the local people's government expressed their gratitude to Xiong Shuling. Xiong Shuling said, "This is my duty. The higher-ups have taught us: We must always maintain the high vigilance of a revolutionary soldier. The credit is not mine."

    战士熊舒龄智捉反革命分子的故事
    谢树
    人民解放军某学校学员、青年团员熊舒龄的假期满了。他就要从家乡——山西天镇县回到学校去。这天，村上和熊舒龄年岁相仿的青年们都到他家来和他交谈。他们从战斗故事谈到农业生产合作社，也谈到刚进行完的普选。熊舒龄的堂兄弟熊延龄说：“这回普选真带劲，好人选上了，坏人都被选了下去，大家心里都痛快得像开了两扇门。”他忽然问熊舒龄：“哥哥，你没打听到庞汝弼的下落吗？”熊舒龄一时想不起来，有些模糊地说：“庞汝弼？”熊延龄说：“是呀！那个反革命，害人精，你怎么一下子就忘了。”
    熊舒龄想了起来。他还是在八年前见过庞汝弼，中等身材、圆脸，两眼细细的像条线。不过，那时村里人都管庞汝弼叫财粮助理员。以后，国民党反动派侵占了张家口，又进攻山西解放区，天镇县被蒋匪军占领了。熊舒龄再见到庞汝弼时，庞汝弼已换上蒋匪保安队的军官服，神气十足地从街上走过去。再以后，熊舒龄参加了解放军，对庞汝弼就什么也不知道了。
    熊舒龄问：“庞汝弼到底作了什么坏事？”大伙七吵八嚷地回答：“把咱们这一带老百姓都害苦啦！怎么就没抓住他呢！”熊延龄说：“庞汝弼自从蒋匪军侵占了张家口之后，就作了蒋匪的忠实走狗。他领着敌人起走了当地人民政府藏在墙壁里的十二枝大枪、一挺轻机枪、两箱手榴弹和十二桶汽油；领着敌人抓住了当时顾家湾村共产党支部书记高克德，在给高克德一顿毒打之后，又把他关进了监牢，直到我军解放天镇县，高克德才被放出来。他还领着敌人抓过当时的三区区长贾英……。庞汝弼因为对蒋匪有功，不到一年就从文书上士提升为中尉军官，成了当地人民的眼中钉。”熊延龄停了一下又说：“‘镇反’的时候，大家找过庞汝弼。这次普选，村里人又提到过这个‘反革命’。只是这家伙无影无踪，有人说，解放军打天镇的时候，他已经死了。”
    不知谁愤愤地说：“真便宜他了，我们要活抓住他来公审就好了！”
    熊舒龄说：“不要紧，只要他还活着，就跑不了。人民就是天罗地网，早晚叫他归案法办。”
    次日清早，熊舒龄奔上归程。火车冲破严寒，向东北疾进。车厢里热呼呼的，非常闷人。熊舒龄坐了一天一夜，当火车经过沈阳时，才买到一个卧铺席位。他斜靠在车壁上和同时归队的副排长闲谈，述说着一路上看到的许多新气象。这时，有四个人走了进来，里面有一个山西口音的人高声笑着说：“快到地方啦，还坐啥睡铺。”另一个说：“这儿比前边宽敞啊！”熊舒龄顺着话音看去，只见先头说话的那个人身着蓝色制服，戴一顶蓝呢便帽，胖胖的圆脸，细眼睛。熊舒龄心里一动，暗想：好面熟，哪里见过。可巧，那四个人就选坐在熊舒龄的斜对面，熊舒龄看见那圆脸人的怀里隐隐地好像有短枪。熊舒龄没有放过这一刹那的念头，偷偷地又瞥了几眼，仔细端详，然后恍然大悟：这不就是多年抓不到的庞汝弼吗？他怕不确实，寻了个机会，就兜搭着问那个圆脸说：“听口音您是山西人，咱们是同乡啊，您贵姓？”那个家伙略略打量了熊舒龄一眼，随后就坦然地回答：“姓庞！”说完，就扭过头去，和他的同伴谈别的去了。
    熊舒龄正盘算着用什么方法去进一步确定这家伙现在的身份。列车疾进的轰隆声，使他猛想起刚才那家伙说的“快到地方了”，难道他们到下站——四平就要下车？这是个难遇的机会，如果他们下了车，就不大容易找到线索了。他决定去找列车上的公安人员共同研究。
    车厢里挤满了人。熊舒龄刚走过两节车厢，凑巧和那圆脸同行的另一个人也跟了过来。熊舒龄把那个人悄悄带到一边问他说：“同志，你是那部分的？”
    那个人奇怪地打量了熊舒龄一眼，反问：“干什么？”
    熊舒龄说：“有要紧事！”
    那个人说：“我是公安人员。”
    熊舒龄又问：“那个圆脸山西人呢？”
      “是某市人民政府的干部。”
      “他叫什么名字？”
      “听说叫庞支云。”
    熊舒龄暗暗想：“这家伙连名字都改了。”那个人说：“同志，你讲吧，有什么事？”熊舒龄锁住眉头，盯视着那个人的脸，一时并没回答。那个人体会到了熊舒龄的意思，说道：“同志，你放心讲吧，我是共产党员，有什么事我能负责。”熊舒龄这才把庞汝弼过去的反革命罪行扼要地讲了一遍。那个人听了略带惊疑地说：“这确实吗？”熊舒龄说：“千真万确！”那个人又说：“我是某县公安局的，庞支云和另外那两个人是某市人民政府的，我们是一同去办案的，如果真像你说的，我能协助你办这件事。”
    熊舒龄说：“这事还能当儿戏，我就是人证！”他们略略商量了一下，决定由熊舒龄去找列车上的公安人员，那个公安人员回去看住庞汝弼。
    熊舒龄找到了列车上的乘警，他把庞汝弼过去的罪行详细说了一遍，并且说：“我是一个革命军人，我对人民负责。这个反革命分子竟钻到我们人民政府里来了，必须立即逮捕他。”乘警对熊舒龄提供的材料虽然没有怀疑，但是要逮捕一个反革命罪犯也不能不十分慎重。乘警郑重地问他：“熊同志，你不会认错人吗？如果逮捕错了，很不好啊！”熊舒龄说：“不会，我认得准，他和过去一模一样，只是胖了些。这次我回家去，当地群众都在打听他的下落。如果错过这个机会，就怕要漏网！万一逮捕错了，一切责任都由我来担负。”就这样，他们迅速报告四平铁路保卫处；经铁路保卫处批准，决定了立即扣捕这个反革命罪犯的措施。
    熊舒龄从容回到寝车。这时，庞汝弼正在和熊舒龄的副排长谈话，搭讪着问：“刚才出去吃饭的那个同志是山西那一县的？”熊舒龄一脚迈进来，怕副排长说漏了，忙回答说：“大同市鼓楼街的，同志，你呢？”庞汝弼没料到熊舒龄在这时回来，略略迟疑了一下，不自然地说：“我也是大同的。我还在鼓楼街上过一年中学呢！”说完，就又扭过身去，连连看表。熊舒龄若无其事地坐在自己席位上，斜眼扫去，庞汝弼脸色发白，鼻尖有点冒汗。熊舒龄心里更有底了。
    车快进四平，车厢里突然进来了两个乘警，接着，两支驳壳枪就堵在庞汝弼面前。乘警喊道：“不许动，举起手来！”庞汝弼这时反倒装得很沉着，大声说：“这是干什么，把枪收起来，我是人民政府的干部。”和庞汝弼同行的两个人因为不明了情况，像要过来诘问。熊舒龄说：“谁也不许动！我们要逮捕的是化名叫庞支云的反革命罪犯。”
    庞汝弼的脸色一下子就变白了，满脸冒汗，慢慢把手举起来。熊舒龄上去下了庞汝弼的手枪，上了绑绳。熊舒龄心里的一块石头落了地。他摘下口罩，对庞汝弼说：“还认识我吧，庞汝弼不是你的本名吗？”
    庞汝弼两目瞠视，低下头来，有气无力地吐出了个“是”字。这时，火车正“呜呜”地鸣起汽笛，缓缓地停在四平站，乘客们都挤挤嚷嚷地下车了。
    当夜，在和某市人民政府取得联系后，熊舒龄又随同两位乘警押着庞汝弼返回某市；另外的三个人自去执行任务了。抵达某市后，熊舒龄向一位姓赵的科长详详细细地作了汇报。他们又重新认真地作了调查，证实庞汝弼的确是长期隐藏在革命队伍内部的反革命分子。他隐瞒了自己的历史，而且混进了共产党，最近还被选为党的支部委员。最近庞汝弼刚被提拔起来，在他看管下的两名反革命罪犯就跑了。
    当地人民政府的干部向熊舒龄表示感谢。熊舒龄说：“这是我应尽的责任。上级教育我们：要时刻保持革命军人的高度警惕，这功劳不在我身上。”
