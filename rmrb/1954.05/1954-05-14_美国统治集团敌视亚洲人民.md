The U.S. Ruling Clique Is Hostile to the People of Asia
Wu Quan

Recently, more and more evidence proves that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles shifted the focus of his diplomatic activities from Geneva to Washington in order to obstruct and sabotage the Geneva Conference, organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and achieve his goal of expanding the war in Indochina.

Dulles openly stated when he left Geneva on May 3 that he would step up the establishment of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to suffocate the peace in Indochina within the "framework" of this aggressive bloc. A series of activities he carried out after returning home were related to this conspiracy. On May 6, U.S. President Eisenhower also issued a statement saying, "Plans for implementing security arrangements in Southeast Asia are underway," and declared that the establishment of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc "may have a significant impact on what happens in Geneva during the part of the conference that discusses the Indochina issue."

That is why, while the Geneva Conference began to discuss the Indochina issue, Dulles was even more impatient to promote the plan of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. According to a report by the United States International News Service on May 9, Dulles "hopes to arrange a multinational conference in Washington soon to quickly reach an agreement on immediately concluding a collective security agreement." The Associated Press revealed on May 7 that he even wanted to produce a "temporary agreement" within a week, because even such an agreement "would provide the Eisenhower government with a united front to rely on in the event of an emergency that urgently requires some new military action."

Therefore, both Dulles' and Eisenhower's statements thoroughly exposed the purpose of their planning of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. However, Eisenhower still insisted that the "main purpose" of the United States organizing this aggressive bloc "is not to launch a war." But if the United States is not very interested in continuing the Indochina war, then why did Dulles leave Geneva in a hurry, instead of sitting down for serious negotiations, and instead set his sights on building a military bloc? Why did Eisenhower use the establishment of a military bloc to "influence" the Geneva Conference, instead of putting forward constructive proposals to seek peace in Indochina? It is clear that this is not only a base blackmail tactic based on "strength," but in fact, it is to go into the water with its accomplices and use war to replace the steps of negotiation.

In his speech on May 7, Dulles bluntly stated that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc would "provide an appropriate basis for the United States to participate with armed forces"; at the same time, he once again asked the countries participating in this aggressive bloc to "fully assume significant obligations." What exactly are these "significant obligations"? Dulles publicly answered this question at a press conference on May 11, saying that just as the North Atlantic Treaty includes the obligation to fight, the Southeast Asia alliance also stipulates this obligation. He also shouted in a tone full of gunpowder: "We must prepare to fight." During the Geneva Conference, the U.S. aggressive bloc, fearing that the conference would reach any agreement on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, tried its best to clamor in an attempt to threaten and obstruct the conference in order to make the conference a failure. They believed that this would be conducive to the rapid organization of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, expansion of the war, and maintenance and strengthening of imperialist colonial rule over Asia.

It is difficult for the U.S. ruling clique and their allied accomplices to make people not see their conspiracy. On the contrary, people are soberly watching this conspiracy closely. The attitudes expressed by some important figures in Britain and France recently cannot but attract people's attention. British Deputy Foreign Secretary Lloyd admitted in response to a question from a Labour Party member of the House of Commons on May 10: "Exploratory negotiations on the issue of Southeast Asia defense are now underway." French Commander-in-Chief of the invading Vietnamese army, Navarre, even openly demanded that the Indochina war be "internationalized." He reflected the hysterical mood of the French war faction who did not want to accept the lessons of the Dien Bien Phu campaign, and said: "I don't see any other solution besides internationalization."

However, for Britain and France, especially France, if they still want to seek a solution to the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference, then what good will it do to follow the United States in engaging in aggressive blocs and "united fronts" at the same time?

The people and public opinion of Britain and France cannot but feel anxious and uneasy about this. Many insightful people have already seen very clearly that those groups who want to gain something by relying on the United States' "policy of strength" will only further reduce their international status and be firmly trapped in the shackles of the United States. French newspapers have long exposed that the purpose of the United States is to "attract Indochina into the sphere of influence of the United States" ("Combat") and to make "Indochina a battlefield under the jurisdiction of the Pacific Convention Organization presided over by the Americans" ("Liberation"). Recently, French parliamentarians and the public generally expressed dissatisfaction with the French delegation's practices at the Geneva Conference, especially Pidu's bluffing attitude on the Indochina issue, which is completely understandable.

The Southeast Asia aggressive bloc plan that the United States is stepping up to promote is obviously seriously endangering the peace, security, and sovereignty of Asian countries. The Asian people soberly see that the spearhead of this U.S. aggressive plan is not only directed at the people of Indochina and the People's Republic of China, but also at all other Asian countries that love peace, demand an end to colonialism, and defend their independence and sovereignty. For example, countries like India, Indonesia, and Burma are the first to suffer direct threats. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in a statement issued on April 24: "There are already signs that there is a danger of direct intervention in Indochina, the internationalization of the war, and its expansion and intensification." "They imply a harm to the independence of Asian countries that has recently been won and is cherished by them." This concern is shared by the Asian people. Indonesia's "National Vanguard" published a commentary on May 7 saying: "The Southeast Asia Defense Alliance will be regarded as an activity aimed at maintaining colonialism. This activity is clearly in conflict with the principle of basic human rights and threatens world peace. We believe that the five countries participating in the Colombo Conference, which have just condemned colonialism, will never participate in this alliance." Burma's "Rangoon Daily" also pointed out that the current actions of the United States in Southeast Asia have seriously threatened Burma.

Isn't the situation clear enough? The Asian people want peace, but the U.S. ruling clique wants war; the Asian people want independence and freedom, but the U.S. ruling clique wants to maintain colonial rule over Asia; the Asian people want security, but the U.S. ruling clique wants to use aggressive blocs to threaten their security. The U.S. ruling clique's conspiracy to be hostile to the interests of the Asian people and to continue riding on the heads of the Asian people is already as clear as fire. However, another fact is equally clear. That is: the Asian people are already victoriously winning on the road to peace, independence, freedom, and security, and this road cannot be blocked by anyone.

    美国统治集团敌视亚洲人民
    吴全
    最近越来越多的情况证明，美国国务卿杜勒斯所以把他的外交活动的重心从日内瓦移到华盛顿，是因为这样可以更便于阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议，组织东南亚侵略集团，并实现其扩大印度支那战争的目的。
    杜勒斯在五月三日离开日内瓦时就曾公开表示，他要加紧建立东南亚侵略集团，把印度支那的和平窒息在这个侵略集团的“框子里面去”。他回国后所进行的一系列活动，都是和这个阴谋相联系的。五月六日，美国总统艾森豪威尔也发表声明说：“关于实现东南亚的安全安排的计划正在进行中”，并声言东南亚侵略集团的建立，“可能对在举行讨论印度支那问题的那一部分会议期间在日内瓦发生的情况具有重大影响。”
    就是因为这样，正当日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题的时候，杜勒斯对于推行东南亚侵略集团的计划，是更加急不可耐了。据美国国际新闻社五月九日电报道，杜勒斯“希望很快就在华盛顿安排一个多国会议来赶快对立即订立一项集体安全协定达成协议”。美联社五月七日并透露，他甚至想在一周内就要先产生一个“临时协定”，因为即使这样一个协定，“也会给艾森豪威尔政府在紧急情况之下认为十分迫切须要采取某种新的军事行动所能指靠的一种联合阵线”。
    因此，无论是杜勒斯或是艾森豪威尔的声明，都把他们策划东南亚侵略集团的目的，彻底地揭露出来了。但是，艾森豪威尔却还强辩说：美国组织这种侵略集团的“主要的目的并不是为了发动战争”。可是，如果美国对继续印度支那战争没有多大的兴趣，那末，为什么杜勒斯要匆匆离开日内瓦，不坐下来认真谈判，而却志在搞军事集团？为什么艾森豪威尔要拿建立军事集团来“影响”日内瓦会议，而不是拿出建设性的建议来谋求印度支那的和平？很清楚，这不仅仅是一种从“实力出发”的卑劣的讹诈手段，而且实际上就是要和它的同谋者们一起下水，用战争来代替谈判的步骤。
    杜勒斯在五月七日的演说中，就露骨地说：东南亚侵略集团将“为美国以武装部队参加进去提供一个适当的基础”；同时，他再度要求参加这一侵略集团的国家“全体承担重大的义务”。究竟是什么“重大的义务”呢？杜勒斯在五月十一日的记者招待会上公开回答这个问题说，正如北大西洋公约中包括着作战的义务一样，东南亚联盟也规定这种义务。他并以充满火药气息的口吻叫喊着：“我们就要准备战斗。”在日内瓦会议进行期间，美国侵略集团唯恐会议会就恢复印度支那和平问题达成任何协议，因此努力叫嚣，企图对会议进行威胁和阻挠，以求会议失败。他们认为这样，才能有利于迅速组织东南亚侵略集团，扩大战争，保持并加强帝国主义对亚洲的殖民统治。
    美国统治集团和他们的盟国同伙想使人们看不见它们的这个阴谋活动，是很困难的。相反地，人们正在清醒地密切注视着这个阴谋活动，最近英国和法国某些重要人物所表示的态度，就不能不引起人们的注视。英国外交副大臣劳埃德在五月十日答复下院工党议员的质询时承认：“关于东南亚防御问题的探讨性的谈判现在正在进行中”。法国侵越军总司令纳瓦尔更是公开要求把印度支那战争“国际化”。他反映了法国主战派想不接受奠边府战役的教训的歇斯底里情绪，居然说：“除了国际化之外，我看不出还有任何其他解决办法。”
    但是，对于英国和法国，特别是法国来说，如果还想在日内瓦会议上求得印度支那问题的解决，那末，同时又跟着美国搞侵略集团，搞“联合阵线”，难道会有什么好结果吗？
    英国和法国的人民和舆论都不能不对此感到焦虑和不安。许多有见解的人士已经看得很清楚，那些想依靠美国的“实力政策”来取得一些什么的集团，除了使自己的国际地位更加降低，被牢牢地套在美国的绳索中以外，是决不会有什么出息的。法国报纸早就揭露了美国的目的，是企图把印度支那“吸引到美国的势力范围”内（“战斗报”），并使“印度支那成为在美国人所主持的太平洋公约组织管辖下的一个战场”（“解放报”）。最近法国议员们和社会公众对法国代表团在日内瓦会议上的做法，特别是对皮杜尔在印度支那问题上所采取的虚张声势的态度，普遍表示不满，这是完全可以理解的。
    美国加紧推行的东南亚侵略集团计划，显然是严重危害亚洲各国的和平、安全与主权的。亚洲人民清醒地看到，美国这个侵略计划的矛头，不仅指向印度支那人民和中华人民共和国，而且是指向所有爱好和平、要求结束殖民主义和捍卫自己的独立主权的亚洲其他国家。例如，像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸等国就首当其冲地遭受到直接的威胁。印度总理尼赫鲁在四月二十四日发表的声明中曾指出：“已经有着迹象，在印度支那有发生直接干涉，发生战争的国际化及其扩大和加剧的危险。”“它们隐含着对于亚洲各国新近赢得并为他们所珍贵的独立的危害”。这种关切是亚洲人民人同此心的。印尼“民族先锋报”在五月七日发表评论说：“东南亚防御联盟将会被认为是一种旨在保持殖民主义的活动。这种活动显然是和基本人权原则相抵触的，并威胁着世界和平的。我们相信刚谴责过殖民主义的参加科伦坡会议的五个国家决不会参加这个联盟。”缅甸“仰光日报”也指出，目前美国在东南亚的行动，已使缅甸受到严重威胁。
    情形难道还不清楚吗？亚洲人民要和平，美国统治集团却要战争；亚洲人民要独立自由，美国统治集团却要保持对亚洲的殖民统治；亚洲人民要安全，美国统治集团却要用侵略集团来威胁他们的安全。美国统治集团敌视亚洲人民的利益，想继续骑在亚洲人民头上的阴谋，已经是明若观火了。但是，另外一个事实也是同样清楚的。那就是：亚洲人民已经在胜利地赢得和平、独立、自由和安全的道路上，这条道路是谁也阻塞不住的。
