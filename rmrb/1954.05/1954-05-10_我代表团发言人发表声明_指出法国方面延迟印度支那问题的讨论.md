Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 8th. The spokesperson for the Delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Geneva Conference issued the following statement on May 8th:

    The press officer of the French delegation to the Geneva Conference, at a press conference on May 7th, read out an account of the alleged contact and consultation between the French delegation and the Chinese delegation regarding the evacuation of wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu, stating that the Chinese delegation said this issue fell within the scope of seeking peace in Indochina. He then continued, "The start of the conference was mainly delayed due to procedural issues raised by the Viet Minh's partners."

    The spokesperson for the Delegation of the People's Republic of China declared: The above statement is inconsistent with the facts.

    The facts are: In the early stages of the Geneva Conference, until the afternoon of May 5th, there was no contact between the French delegation and the Chinese delegation. On the afternoon of May 5th, an official from the French delegation visited an official from the Chinese delegation to discuss the issue of evacuating wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu. Reportedly, the French side found it inconvenient to contact the Vietnamese delegation and requested the Chinese delegation to act as an intermediary. On the morning of May 6th, personnel from the Chinese delegation replied to the French side, stating that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had arrived in Geneva, and discussions on the Indochina issue could begin; the French issue regarding the evacuation of wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu would be discussed at the conference, and both sides could then make contact.

    At that time, it had already been agreed that a meeting to discuss the Indochina issue would be held on May 7th. However, on the evening of May 6th, for undisclosed reasons, the French side cancelled the preliminary agreement to discuss the Indochina issue on the 7th; the plenary session on the 7th was temporarily changed back to continuing the discussion of the Korean issue. Therefore, the responsibility for delaying the meeting to discuss the Indochina issue and resolving the issue of evacuating wounded soldiers rests with the French side.

    In the early stages of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union had proposed inviting the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to arrive so that the Indochina issue could be discussed as soon as possible, but the French delegation only finally agreed on May 3rd. On May 4th, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam arrived in Geneva. However, on the evening of the 6th, due to the opinion of the French side, the discussion of the Indochina issue originally scheduled for the 7th was delayed.

    From the above facts, it is not difficult to see what the real intention of the French side is regarding the issue of evacuating wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu.

Xinhua News Agency, May 8th. News from Geneva indicates that the American authorities, who are painstakingly delaying and obstructing the peace negotiations in Indochina, are "fully supporting" a faction within the French government to use the French army's defeat at Dien Bien Phu to shift the responsibility for delaying the negotiations onto the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. French Prime Minister Laniel stated in a statement on the 7th: "The enemy wants to capture Dien Bien Phu before the Geneva Conference begins discussing the Indochina issue." On the same day, Pignon, the press officer for the French representative to the Geneva Conference, also issued a statement saying:
  "The communist side is waiting for the outcome of the battle of Dien Bien Phu before allowing the conference to proceed."

    However, everyone knows that it is the Washington authorities who have stubbornly opposed a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue through consultation from the beginning, and emphasized that France should continue fighting. The United States has openly planned to take so-called "joint action" to expand the Indochina war. After the opening of the Geneva Conference, the United States was unwilling to quickly begin negotiations on the Indochina issue. The United States opposed the participation of representatives from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the discussions and instructed the Bao Dai regime to obstruct them, causing undue delays in the issue of members participating in the Indochina issue negotiations. After an agreement was reached on the issue of members and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam quickly arrived in Geneva, discussions on the Indochina issue should have begun immediately, but the date for holding such discussions, although scheduled, was cancelled by France when the time came. From this, it can be seen that Laniel's attempt to shift the responsibility for delaying the negotiations onto Vietnam is not in accordance with the facts.

    Now, the American authorities are attempting to use the end of the Dien Bien Phu campaign to incite war hysteria and promote Dulles' "joint action" plan, which aims to expand the war. According to a Reuters report on the 7th, Washington officials are "more optimistic than at some times in the past" because "the failure at Dien Bien Phu" has "justified" Dulles's claims. The American authorities also hope to use this to create a so-called "joint declaration of intent" to threaten the Geneva Conference, in order to achieve the goal of obstructing negotiations on the Indochina issue.

### 我代表团发言人发表声明  指出法国方面延迟印度支那问题的讨论

    我代表团发言人发表声明
    指出法国方面延迟印度支那问题的讨论
    【新华社日内瓦八日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人于五月八日发表声明如下：
    法国出席日内瓦会议代表团新闻发布官五月七日在记者招待会上宣读了据称法国代表团与中国代表团接触商谈有关奠边府伤兵撤退的经过，并说中国代表团称这个问题属于谋求印度支那和平问题的范围。他又接着说，“会议的开始，主要是由于越盟的伙伴们所提出的程序问题而受到了延搁。”
    中华人民共和国代表团发言人声明：上述声明与事实不符。
    事实是：在日内瓦会议初期，直到五月五日下午以前，法国代表团与中国代表团并无任何接触。五月五日下午，法国代表团一官员来访中国代表团一官员，商谈奠边府撤退伤兵的问题。据称，法国方面，不便与越南代表团接洽，要求中国代表团作中间人。五月六日上午中国代表团的人员即回答了法国方面，说明越南民主共和国代表团已抵日内瓦，关于印度支那问题的讨论即可开始；法国关于撤退奠边府伤兵的问题，当会在会议中谈到，双方即可进行接触。
    当时，已经商定在五月七日召开讨论印度支那问题会议。但是在五月六日的晚上，法国方面由于不可告人的理由，取消了七日讨论印度支那问题的初步协议；七日的大会，临时仍改回继续讨论朝鲜问题。因此，拖延讨论印度支那问题的会议和解决撤退伤兵问题的责任，在于法国方面。
    在日内瓦会议初期，苏联即曾提出邀请越南民主共和国代表团到来，以便早日讨论印度支那问题，而法国代表团却延到五月三日才最后同意。五月四日，越南民主共和国代表团就来到了日内瓦。但是到了六日晚上，由于法国的意见，原定于七日举行的印度支那问题的讨论却被延迟了。
    从上述的事实中，不难看出，法国方面在撤退奠边府伤兵问题上真正的意图是什么。
    【新华社八日讯】来自日内瓦的消息表明：处心积虑拖延和阻挠印度支那的和平谈判的美国当局，正在“全力支持”法国政府中一部分人利用法国军队在奠边府的失败，把拖延谈判的责任推到越南民主共和国身上。法国总理拉尼埃在七日发表的声明中表示：“敌人要在日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题之前攻陷奠边府。”同一天，参加日内瓦会议的法国代表皮杜尔的新闻官员也发表声明说：
  “共方是在等待奠边府战斗有了结果后再使会议开始进行。”
    但是，谁都知道，是华盛顿当局，一开始就顽固地反对通过协商来和平解决印度支那问题，而强调要法国继续打下去，美国并公开策划采取所谓
  “联合行动”来扩大印度支那战争。日内瓦会议开幕以后，美国又不肯迅速开始关于印度支那问题的谈判。美国反对越南民主共和国代表参加讨论并指使保大政权来进行阻挠，使关于参加印度支那问题谈判的成员问题遭到不应有的拖延。在成员问题达成协议、越南民主共和国代表团迅速到达日内瓦以后，关于印度支那问题的讨论本来应该立即开始，但是，举行这种讨论的日期虽然已经规定，到期却被法国取消。由此可见，拉尼埃想把拖延谈判的责任推到越南身上是不合乎事实的。
    现在，美国当局正企图利用奠边府战役的结束来煽动战争歇斯底里，推行杜勒斯的以扩大战争为目的的“联合行动”计划。据路透社七日报道，华盛顿官员“比以往一些时候更为乐观”，因为“奠边府的失败”使杜勒斯的主张“有了根据”。美国当局并希望借此搞出一个所谓“联合意图声明”来威胁日内瓦会议，以便达到阻挠印度支那问题的谈判的目的。
