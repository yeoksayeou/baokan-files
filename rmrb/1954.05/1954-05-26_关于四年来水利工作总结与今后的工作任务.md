    Regarding the Summary of Water Conservancy Work in the Past Four Years and Future Work Tasks
    Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government
    (I)
    In the past four years, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, great progress has been made in national water conservancy work. With the support of government investment and loans, and the efforts of cadres at all levels and the broad masses, as of October 1953, according to incomplete statistics, including projects undertaken by the masses themselves, a total of over 2,688 million cubic meters of earthwork, over 17 million cubic meters of stonework, and 630,000 cubic meters of concrete work have been completed. Through such large-scale projects and mass-based flood and drought prevention work, the following gains have been achieved:
    First, the threat of floods from the Huai River, Yellow River, Yangtze River, and general rivers and lakes has been reduced to varying degrees, and a foundation has been laid for water conservancy development in some areas.
    The treatment of the Huai River in recent years has focused on preventing flooding from the main stream and major tributaries, and reducing waterlogging. A total of three reservoirs have been completed, three reservoirs are under construction, 16 lake and depression flood storage projects have been completed, 104 control sluices and culverts have been completed, 1,562 kilometers of dikes have been repaired and reinforced, and 77 rivers and channels have been dredged and newly opened, with a total length of 2,969 kilometers, completing a total of over 400 million cubic meters of earthwork. (Excluding mass-organized ditch and furrow projects)
    Through these projects, the floods of the Huai River have been initially controlled: in the downstream Jiangsu area, after the completion of the Sanhe Sluice and the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, the threat of the Huai River floods can be basically eliminated even under the 1921 flood (the longest and largest flood in hydrological records), and a foundation has been laid for the development of irrigation and navigation in the vast areas of Subei. A part of the sluice and ship lock projects for irrigation and navigation have also been completed. In the middle reaches of the Anhui area, under the regulation and control of the Runheji Diversion Sluice and its related lake and depression flood storage projects, the Huai River main embankment may not collapse in the 1950 flood (the highest water level above Bengbu in hydrological records). In the upstream Henan area, the Hong and Ru Rivers have the regulation of the Shimantan and Banqiao Reservoirs and the depression flood storage projects, and the flood prevention situation has been improved with the coordination of local river regulation. The flood threat in the upper reaches of the Ying River has also been reduced after the construction of the Baisha Reservoir.
    In terms of reducing waterlogging disasters, the diversion project of the Huai River main stream below Wuhe and the Chong and Tong Rivers is about to be completed, and the regulation projects of the North Fei River, Sui River and other river basins have been started. Many other heavily affected rivers have also been preliminarily dredged. With the coordination of mass-based ditch and furrow projects, the waterlogging situation has been initially improved.
    In addition, the reservoir projects that have been completed and are under construction have irrigation and hydropower generation designs or construction in addition to flood control.
    The 1,789-kilometer dikes of the lower Yellow River have been reinforced with nearly 100 million cubic meters of earthwork since liberation, and the top height of the dikes generally exceeds the 1933 flood level by 1.5 to 3 meters. Since the implementation of dike body cone penetration work, more than 45 million boreholes have been drilled, and more than 70,000 hidden dangers in the dikes have been discovered and repaired. Due to the consolidation and strengthening of the dikes and the efforts of the people along the river to prevent floods, the main dikes have not breached after several major floods in the past four years. According to the existing dike strength, coupled with planned flood storage, detention, and diversion, it is possible to strive to defend against the same flood as in 1933 (the largest flood in hydrological records). About 300 kilometers of new dikes have been built in the Inner Mongolia area of the upper reaches, and key pilot projects for soil and water conservation have been started on the Northwest Loess Plateau. In order to reduce the threat of ice flood breaches in the lower reaches, a ice reduction and overflow project has been built in Lijin, Shandong.
    The threat of floods from the Yangtze River is most serious in the middle reaches. In addition to strengthening the dikes, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been built, which basically eliminates the danger of the Jingjiang Dike breaching and plays an important role in protecting the safety of the Jianghan Plain. The South Dongting Lake Regulation Project has been carried out, which has increased the guarantee for the lakeside area. The Han River has a wide upper reaches and narrow lower reaches, and the threat of floods is serious. However, due to the continuous strengthening of the dikes and the vigorous flood prevention by the masses in recent years, the flood situation has also been alleviated. The 1953 flood exceeded the highest water level in previous years and was safely passed through rescue.
    In the Yishui and Shu River basins of Shandong and Jiangsu, Shandong and Jiangsu separately formulated plans at the beginning of liberation, and carried out construction in stages over the past four years, opening up the Xinshu River and the Xinyi River, which initially solved the problem of flood discharge, and local waterlogging has also been improved.
    In the various rivers of North China, the Guanting Reservoir has been built in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, which can control all the floods above Guanting, reduce the disasters in the lower reaches, and lay the foundation for hydropower generation and other water conservancy development in the lower reaches. A new river channel has been opened up in the Chaobai River, which basically eliminates the threat of frequent floods. A flood reduction river flowing into the sea independently has been opened up in the lower reaches of the Daqing River, which alleviates the threat of floods to Tianjin and the lower reaches of the Daqing River.
    In the Pearl River Delta region, many dike jointing and sluice construction projects have been carried out in the past four years, which have played a considerable role in flood prevention, drainage, and ensuring agricultural production; in order to facilitate navigation, the Chencun Waterway has been improved. The coastal dikes in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian have been consolidated and strengthened in recent years, and have also played a great role in resisting typhoons and sea tides.
    In the Liao River basin in Northeast China, where floods often occur, treatment has begun. First, the Dahuofang Reservoir is being built on the tributary Hun River, and construction began in 1953. New dikes have been built on the Taoer River and Raoyang River, and soil and water conservation projects have been carried out in the upper reaches of the Raoyang River.
    In addition, the dikes have been strengthened and the river channels have been dredged in the medium and small rivers in various places under the leadership of local party and government departments, and the flood prevention and drainage situation has generally improved.
    Second, extensive farmland water conservancy projects have been built, irrigation management has been improved, the irrigated area has been expanded year by year, and the drought prevention capacity has been gradually improved.
    In the past four years, great development has been made in farmland water conservancy across the country. A total of more than 6 million small reservoirs, dams, and channels have been built and renovated, more than 800,000 wells have been drilled, more than 500,000 waterwheels have been loaned out, 30,000 horsepower of pumping machines have been added, and more than 250 large-scale irrigation projects and more than 30 drainage projects have been restored and built. In addition, with the improvement of irrigation management, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 56 million mu. It has played an important role in increasing agricultural production in recent years.
    Mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects are cost-effective, efficient, and quick to produce results. Among the aforementioned newly added irrigated areas, the irrigated area expanded by small-scale water conservancy accounts for more than 45 million mu. These projects are widely distributed throughout the country and have begun to penetrate into the border areas inhabited by ethnic minority brothers. Among them, mechanical irrigation and drainage projects and small reservoir projects have also made preliminary development.
    Among the large-scale irrigation projects, the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Henan Province has created experience for large-scale diversion of the Yellow River water for irrigation in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The Hongyanchi and "August 1st" reservoir and canal projects built in Xinjiang, the Tanglai Canal renovated in Ningxia, the Dongyuan Canal and Beichuan Canal newly built in Qinghai, and the Luohui Canal newly built in Shaanxi have turned more than 1.6 million mu of dry land in the Northwest into water land. The Dujiangyan irrigation project in Sichuan is a great labor achievement of the ancient Chinese people. After renovation and expansion after liberation, the irrigated area has reached 3.1 million mu. The Panshan, Lishu, Chahayang, and Guoqianqi irrigation areas renovated in the Northeast region have restored and expanded the irrigated area by more than 400,000 mu. Other large-scale projects with a newly added irrigation area of more than 50,000 mu, such as the Hutuo River irrigation canal in Shanxi Province, the Shijin Canal in Hebei Province, the Lutai, Qinghe, and Hangu electric pumping irrigation projects along the Bohai Sea, the Tonggong Dam in Anhui Province, the Lianbinggang in Fujian Province, and the Erling electric pumping irrigation project in Jiangsu Province, are also newly built. The above projects have played a certain role in solving the problem of large-scale drought and promoted the development of state-owned farms.
    Democratic reforms have been carried out in the management of various irrigation channels, and management systems have been established, and irrigation efficiency has been gradually improved. In recent years, under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, the leadership ideology in various places has begun to pay attention to water use management, and key organizations have carried out irrigation experiments to study soil improvement methods to prevent land salinization.
    Third, the technical and business level has been improved in practical work, and a group of engineering and technical personnel and huge construction forces have been trained.
    In recent years, with the help of Soviet experts, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, combined with China's actual situation, some old technical ideas have been changed, and mistakes and shortcomings have been continuously corrected, and the direction of water conservancy construction and the water management strategies of some river basins have been gradually explored. Especially in the treatment of the Huai River and other river basins, we have clarified the importance of water storage, clarified that water is a valuable resource of the country, and should be stored as much as possible under possible conditions, including large-scale water storage using reservoirs and lakes, and decentralized water storage using ditches, furrows, ponds, dams, and soil and water conservation, which can not only reduce flood disasters, but also prevent drought disasters, and some can also create conditions for navigation, hydropower generation, and urban water supply.
    In the past four years, many highly technical projects have been done throughout the country, such as the south and north sluices of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Guanting Reservoir, the Foziling Reservoir, the Sanhe Sluice, and the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project. In the practice of work, China's water conservancy technology has gradually improved. At the same time, the construction teams of vast numbers of farmers, workers, and demobilized soldiers have been trained, and a group of technical personnel and grass-roots cadres for construction management have been trained. All these have laid a certain foundation for long-term water conservancy construction in the future.
    The reason why water conservancy work can achieve these achievements is mainly due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the enthusiasm of the laboring farmers to develop production after the victorious completion of the land reform, the support of the working class for agricultural production, the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, the close cooperation of various business departments, and the active efforts of leaders and cadres in various regions, and in general, it is the concrete manifestation of the superiority of China's people's democratic system.
    However, we have also made many mistakes and shortcomings in our work.
    China is a large country spanning several different natural areas. The conditions are different in different places, and the possible flood and drought disasters are also different. These disasters have both special and frequent differences, and there should be different countermeasures in prevention and control. At the same time, China is currently in a transition period, and the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture have just begun. In rural areas, the small-scale peasant economy still dominates. These natural and social conditions determine the long-term, extensive, and complex nature of water conservancy construction. However, in the past, we lacked specific analysis of these objective conditions, and our understanding was one-sided. The severity of disasters in various places and the order of priority of treatment were not completely in line with the actual needs of agricultural production in various places.
    In carrying out the project, there was a certain degree of impetuous and rash advance mentality, resulting in insufficient research on basic data for some large-scale projects, incomplete planning and design, causing some unnecessary waste and losses. Insufficient research has also been done on the organizational leadership of the construction. The leadership is carried out in a handicraft manner, and we are satisfied with general arrangements and inspections. We have not yet summarized a set of more mature experiences on issues such as construction organization design, site layout, labor organization, responsibility system, technical quotas, equipment utilization, financial management, and safety and sanitation in construction. As for the management and maintenance of the completed reservoirs, sluices, dams, embankments, and river channels, sufficient attention has not yet been paid to them in general. Although management agencies have been established for some projects, there is still a lack of sound systems for operation, use, observation, and maintenance.
    In terms of irrigation projects, the idea of ​​emphasizing project construction but not paying enough attention to irrigation management has not been completely corrected. The phenomenon of improper water use is widespread, which affects the full play of irrigation benefits.
    Insufficient attention has been paid to the leadership of mass-based farmland water conservancy, and there is subjectivism in the leadership methods. There is insufficient research on specific situations, and plans are approved blindly. Emphasis is placed on general calls, and there is a lack of specific guidance, and the policy boundaries and working methods have not been clearly explained, which has led to coercive and commanding phenomena in rural areas on issues such as well drilling and loans.
    In the issues of construction land occupation and relocation compensation, there have been some areas where the resolution has not been perfect.
    In the issue of mobilizing migrant workers, there have been wasteful phenomena, and there have also been phenomena of high and low wage standards.
    The above shortcomings are mainly due to our insufficient ideological and political leadership of cadres, especially the subjectivism and bureaucracy in our leadership. Under the correct leadership of the central government, most of these shortcomings have been corrected, but some still need to be continuously addressed and corrected.
      (II)
    In the future, water conservancy construction should be based on the overall task of the country in the transition period, under the unified leadership of party and government at all levels, according to the specific conditions of various places, specific requirements and feasible steps should be formulated, so that water conservancy construction can serve the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, serve the increase of agricultural production, especially the increase of grain and cotton production, and gradually overcome water and drought disasters, and strive to reduce them year by year.
    Water conservancy construction must serve the overall task, and prevent the simple engineering viewpoint that deviates from the overall task. When formulating river basin plans and designing various large-scale projects, we should take into account the current and expected future needs of national industrial and agricultural development and the possible conditions, take care of the overall situation, and consider it as a whole, so as to prevent one-sided ideas that deviate from reality. Farmland water conservancy work must be linked to the overall task of transforming the small-scale peasant economy. It is entirely possible to promote mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production through small-scale water conservancy. Experience has shown that many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have become more consolidated because they have drilled wells, opened canals, set up waterwheels, increased production, and increased income. On the other hand, a small number of mutual aid and cooperation organizations have caused difficulties and affected the consolidation of the organizations due to blindly drilling wells and opening canals regardless of the conditions. In the future, all localities should eliminate blindness, eliminate subjectivism and commandism, actively promote farmland water conservancy work based on needs and possible conditions, and consciously use farmland water conservancy work to promote mutual assistance and cooperation. More attention should be paid to this when issuing farmland water conservancy loans. In addition to meeting the needs of state-owned farms, the water conservancy of large-scale irrigation areas and flood storage reclamation areas should also pay attention to promoting the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    In our work, we must strengthen the investigation and research of actual situations, improve planning, and prevent blindness. Large-scale water conservancy projects must adopt a steady approach, oppose greed and impatience, adhere to the basic construction procedures, strengthen planning and design and basic work, and practice thrift, oppose waste, and ensure project quality. In both design and construction, responsibility systems should be gradually established to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible. The management and application of completed projects is an important key to ensuring that each project fully exerts its due benefits and extends its service life, and all localities should pay more attention to it. When carrying out mass-based water conservancy projects, we must adapt to local conditions, based on the needs and possibilities of the masses, and implement the principle of voluntary participation of the masses. At the same time, we must effectively rectify existing water conservancy facilities and give full play to their due benefits. Guidance for various mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects should be given the same importance as the management of large rivers.
    Correctly implementing policies is an important key to mobilizing the masses to extensively build water conservancy. In the future, when mobilizing migrant workers to build water conservancy, we must consider it together with agricultural production, and do our best not to violate farming seasons. The wages of migrant workers should be determined by the construction unit and the local party and government organs that send out labor, based on the specific situation, and implemented after approval by a certain leading agency. The issues of water conservancy construction land occupation and the relocation and compensation of water reservoir flood storage areas should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Government Administration Council's "Measures for National Construction Requisition of Land." The outstanding issues in water conservancy loans in the past should be cleared up in accordance with the spirit of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Cleaning up Some Issues in Agricultural Loans." In the future, the use of water conservancy investment loans should first pay attention to the needs of grain and cotton producing areas to build water conservancy, and should also appropriately take care of disaster areas, poor mountain areas, old revolutionary base areas, and ethnic minority areas.
    In order to adapt to the needs of water conservancy construction, it is necessary to actively and systematically train cadres and strengthen professional engineering teams. All water conservancy cadres should establish the determination to work and study for a long time, earnestly study and gradually master their business. In order to enhance the technical strength of water conservancy construction, on the one hand, we must continuously train new technical talents in schools and construction sites, and pay special attention to training and promoting worker-peasant cadres, which is the main thing and requires long-term continuous efforts; on the other hand, we must strengthen the unity and education of existing technical personnel, so that they establish the view of wholeheartedly serving the people, go deep into the masses, study their business, combine science and technology with the practical experience of the masses, and rapidly improve their ideological and business level, so that they can undertake more work and adapt to the urgent needs of current work.
    According to the above-mentioned policies, the main specific tasks of water conservancy construction can be summarized as follows:
      (1) Treatment of the Yellow River.
    In order to prevent abnormal floods from attacking, causing serious breaches or changes in course, causing major disasters, and affecting the country's construction deployment, we must continue to strengthen the annual maintenance and flood prevention work of the dikes on the one hand, and actively and step by step carry out soil and water conservation work in the loess plateau area of the upper reaches, and build small reservoirs in the tributaries to prevent soil erosion and reduce sediment discharge; on the other hand, we must actively study the fundamental treatment of the Yellow River, formulate a river basin plan for the Yellow River, and gradually implement it according to human resources, material resources, financial resources, and technical conditions, in order to eliminate the threat of Yellow River floods and develop water conservancy.
      (2) Treatment of the Yangtze River.
    The fundamental treatment of the Yangtze River will take longer. At present, we should strengthen the dikes, ensure that the Jingjiang Dike does not breach, and buy time to seek fundamental treatment. The Han River Reservoir continues to be compared and studied, fully prepared, and in the next few years, we will first study and take appropriate measures to reduce the flood burden of the Han River. Study the flood storage reclamation plan for Dongting Lake and the lakes in the middle and lower reaches, and strive to hold a part within five years. The collection and research of data from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and its important tributaries is very important for formulating the river basin plan of the Yangtze River, and should be actively carried out.
      (3) Continue to vigorously treat the Huai River to reduce the harm of this disaster-prone river.
    According to the experience of treating the Huai River, the fundamental treatment of the Huai River must be carried out in two steps. The first step focuses on eliminating floods and waterlogging disasters under normal rainstorm conditions, and strives to prevent the main and tributary embankments from breaching and flooding in the event of the same floods as in 1921. The second step is to eliminate extraordinary floods and comprehensively develop water conservancy. Yi, Shu, Wen, and Si have been included in the scope of Huai River treatment, and their treatment steps will be studied and decided with reference to the Huai River treatment steps.
      (4) Continue the treatment of the Yongding River and start the treatment of the Liao River. In order to reduce the Liao River flood disaster, first build the Dahuofang Reservoir on the tributary Hun River, which is required to be completed in the first five-year plan, and collect data and formulate river basin plans for the remaining tributaries, and choose to hold them when they are mature. Other severely affected rivers, such as the Nanyun River in Hebei and the Tuohai and Majia Rivers in Shandong, should also be properly treated to reduce flood and waterlogging disasters under normal rainstorm conditions. For general rivers in various places, it is also required that the dikes do not break under the current guaranteed water level.
      (5) Local water conservancy work should focus on consolidating and consolidating existing projects, developing medium and small-scale farmland water conservancy, cultivating the people's ability to resist disasters, and serving agricultural production. Special attention should be paid to combining small-scale farmland water conservancy work with the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production.
    We should fully estimate the important role played by mass-based small-scale water conservancy in increasing grain production. Under the conditions of the increasing development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the masses' demands for water conservancy construction will inevitably be further increased. Therefore, the water conservancy bureaus of all provinces should focus on strengthening the leadership of mass-based small-scale water conservancy under the leadership of the local party and government. In areas with favorable conditions, medium-sized irrigation and drainage projects can also be appropriately developed. According to past experience, strengthening the leadership of the county is an important key to carrying out mass-based small-scale water conservancy work. To this end, technical cadres should be gradually transferred to enrich the construction departments of the county, and administrative cadres specializing in water conservancy work should be assigned. The source of technical cadres should be partly solved by graduates from local secondary technical schools and some higher schools, but more importantly, a large number of activists, technical talents, and rural cadres among the masses should be cultivated and promoted in actual work. The provincial water conservancy bureaus should strengthen the guidance of mass-based water conservancy policies and technologies. Set up appropriate training courses, train grass-roots technical cadres, summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner, and pay special attention to summarizing typical experiences.
    For large-scale irrigation projects, we should focus on strengthening the management of existing projects, overcoming the bureaucratic phenomena of being divorced from reality and the masses, exploring potential forces, and improving irrigation efficiency. We should take a cautious attitude towards newly built projects, make full preparations, move forward steadily, and choose to hold them.
    The water conservancy bureaus of all provinces should have a main responsible cadre in charge of mass-based water conservancy work. In provinces with more irrigation, there should also be a main responsible cadre in charge of irrigation management work. Strengthen water use management to avoid water waste, prevent land salinization, and expand the irrigated area. In areas with severe soil erosion, water conservancy agencies should closely cooperate with agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and scientific research and other relevant departments to systematically promote soil and water conservation work.
      (6) Resolve the outstanding issues of completed projects.
      (7) For the water conservancy issues that need to be resolved in industrial construction, water conservancy agencies at all levels should be technically responsible for assistance. State-owned farms are a lever to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. Water conservancy departments should actively cooperate with agricultural departments and do their best to solve the needs of farm water conservancy construction. Pumping stations are one of the tools for agricultural collectivization and mechanization. There is a need for them in various places, especially in the rice areas of southern China, which should be given more attention. Pilot projects should be conducted in a planned and focused manner, and then gradually promoted.
    In order to do the above-mentioned work well and complete the task of water conservancy construction, we must strengthen ideological and political leadership in water conservancy agencies at all levels, earnestly study the national overall task, grasp the spirit and essence of the overall task, and implement it in all aspects of the work, strengthen the overall view, strengthen the mass concept, and serve agricultural production, especially grain and cotton production, and serve the country's socialist construction on the basis of opposing subjectivism and bureaucracy.

    关于四年来水利工作总结与今后的工作任务
    中央人民政府水利部部长  傅作义
    （一）
    四年来，在中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，全国水利工作有很大开展。在政府投资与贷款的扶助及各级干部与广大群众的努力下，截至一九五三年十月，据不完全的统计，连同群众自办的工程，共完成土工二十六亿八千余万立方公尺，石工一千七百余万立方公尺，混凝土工六十三万立方公尺。通过这样大规模的工程及群众性的防汛、防旱工作，得到以下的收获：
    第一、在不同程度上，减轻了淮河、黄河、长江及一般河流湖泊的水患，并为某些地区的水利开发建立了基础。
    几年来淮河的治理，是从防止干流及主要支流的洪水泛滥和减轻内涝两方面着手。计已完成水库三处，正在修筑水库三处，完成湖泊洼地蓄洪工程十六处，控制性水闸及涵洞一○四处，修复与加培堤防一千五百六十二公里，疏浚和新开河道七十七条，总长二千九百六十九公里，共完成土方工程达四亿余立方公尺。（群众自办沟洫工程在外）
    通过这些工程，淮河的洪水已得到初步控制：下游江苏地区，在三河闸与苏北灌溉总渠完成以后，在一九二一年洪水（有水文纪录以来历时最长、总量最大的洪水）情况下已可基本消除淮河洪水的威胁，并为苏北广大地区灌溉、航运事业的发展建立了基础。配合灌溉和航运的一部分水闸和船闸工程亦已修建完成。中游安徽地区，在润河集分水闸及其相关的湖泊洼地蓄洪工程的调节控制下，在一九五○年洪水（有水文纪录以来蚌埠以上水位最高的洪水）情况下淮河干堤也可不致溃决。上游河南地区，洪、汝河有石漫滩、板桥水库及洼地蓄洪工程的调节，配合局部河道整理，防洪情况已有改善。颍河上游在修筑白沙水库后，洪水威胁亦有所减轻。
    在减除内涝灾害方面，中游五河以下淮河干流与漴、潼河的分流工程即将完成，并已开始进行北淝河、濉河等河流域的整治工程，其他为患严重的河道也多进行了初步疏浚，配合群众性的沟洫工程，内涝情况已有初步改善。
    此外已经完成和正在修筑的水库工程，除防洪以外有的并已进行着灌溉、水力发电等设计或施工。
    黄河下游一千七百八十九公里的堤防，自解放以来，加培土方近一亿立方公尺，堤顶高度一般超出一九三三年洪水位一点五至三公尺。自推行堤身锥探工作以后，共打钻四千五百余万眼，发见并修补堤防隐患七万余处。由于堤防的巩固加强及沿河群众的努力防汛，四年来经过几次较大洪水袭击，干堤均未发生决口。根据现有堤防强度，加上有计划的蓄洪、滞洪、分洪，可争取防御与一九三三年同样的洪水（有水文纪录以来的最大洪水）。上游内蒙地区修筑新堤约三百公里，西北黄土高原已开始重点试办水土保持。为了减轻下游凌汛决口的威胁，并在山东利津修筑了减凌溢水工程。
    长江洪水的威胁，以中游地区为最严重，四年来除加强堤防以外，修筑了荆江分洪工程，基本上解除了荆江大堤决口的危险，对保护江汉平原的安全有着重要的作用。进行了南洞庭湖整理工程，对滨湖地区增加了保障。汉水的河道上宽下窄，洪水威胁严重存在，但由于几年来堤防不断加强，群众大力防汛，水灾情况亦有减轻，一九五三年洪水超过历年最高水位，经抢救安全渡过。
    山东、江苏的沂河、沭河流域，在解放初期即由山东、江苏分别制订计划，四年来分期施工，开辟新沭河与新沂河，初步解决了排洪的问题，局部内涝亦有改善。
    华北各河，永定河在上游修筑官厅水库以后，已可控制官厅以上的全部洪水，减轻了下游灾害，并为水力发电及下游其他水利开发奠立了基础。潮白河开辟了新河道，基本上解除了经常性洪水的威胁。大清河下游开辟了独流入海减河，减轻了天津及大清河下游地区所受水灾的威胁。
    珠江流域的三角洲地区，四年来进行了很多联围筑闸的工程，对防洪排涝保障农产起了相当的作用；为了便利航运，改善了陈村水道。江苏、浙江、福建沿海的海塘，年来巩固加强，对抗御台风与海潮的侵袭也发挥了很大作用。
    东北区经常发生水灾的辽河流域，已开始治理，首先在支流浑河上修筑大伙房水库，一九五三年已开始动工。洮儿河、绕阳河修筑了新堤，并在绕阳河上游进行了水土保持工程。
    此外，各地中、小河流，在各地党政领导下加强堤防，疏浚河道，防洪排涝情况一般都有改善。
    第二、广泛地兴修了农田水利工程，改进了灌溉管理工作，灌溉面积逐年扩大，防旱能力逐步提高。
    四年来，全国农田水利有很大发展。共兴修与整修小型塘坝渠道等工程六百余万处，凿井八十余万眼，贷放水车五十余万辆，添置抽水机三万余匹马力，恢复与修建较大灌溉工程二百五十余处，排水工程三十余处，加上改进灌溉管理，共扩大灌溉面积五千六百余万亩。对几年来农业增产起了重要作用。
    群众性的小型水利，费省效宏，见效快，在前述新增灌溉面积中，小型水利扩大的灌溉面积即占四千五百多万亩。这些工程广泛分布全国各地，并开始深入边疆兄弟民族地区。其中机械排灌工程与小型水库工程也有初步发展。
    在大型灌溉工程中，河南省引黄灌溉济卫工程，为黄河下游大规模引黄河水灌溉创造了经验。新疆修建的红雁池、“八一”等水库渠道工程，宁夏整修的唐徕渠，青海新建的东原渠、北川渠及陕西新建的洛惠渠等灌溉工程，将西北一百六十余万亩的旱地变成了水地。四川都江堰灌溉工程，是我国古代人民伟大的劳动业绩，解放后经过整修扩建，灌溉面积已达到三百一十万亩。东北区整修的盘山、梨树、查哈阳、郭前旗四大灌区，恢复与扩大灌溉面积四十多万亩。其他如山西省滹沱河灌渠、河北省石津渠、渤海沿岸芦台、清河、汉沽电力抽水灌溉工程、安徽省佟公坝、福建省莲柄港、江苏省珥陵电力抽水灌溉工程等，也都是新建的灌溉五万亩以上的大型工程。以上工程对解决大面积的干旱问题起了一定的作用，并推动了国营农场的发展。
    各灌溉渠道进行了管理上的民主改革，建立了管理制度，灌溉效率逐步提高。几年来在苏联先进经验指导下，各地领导思想上开始注意了用水管理，并重点组织了灌水的试验，研究土壤改良办法防止土地碱化。
    第三、在实际工作中，提高了技术与业务水平，并培养了一批工程技术人员与巨大的施工力量。
    几年来在苏联专家帮助下，学习苏联的先进经验，结合我国的实际情况，改变了某些旧的技术思想，并不断改正错误缺点，逐渐摸索到水利建设的方针与某些流域的治水方略。特别是在治淮及其他流域的治理中，使我们明确了蓄水的重要性，明确了水是国家的宝贵资源，应当在可能的条件下，尽量将水蓄起来，包括利用水库、湖泊进行大规模的蓄水，和利用沟洫、畦田、塘坝及水土保持等进行分散性的蓄水，既可减少洪水灾害，又可防御旱灾，有的还可为航运、水力发电及供应城市用水创设条件。
    四年来全国各地做了许多技术性较高的工程，如荆江分洪工程的南、北闸，官厅水库、佛子岭水库、三河闸及引黄灌溉济卫工程等，在工作的实践中，使我国的水利技术逐步提高。同时，锻炼了广大农民、工人和转业军人的施工队伍，并培养了一批技术人员和施工管理的基层干部。这些都为今后长远的水利建设奠下了一定的基础。
    水利工作所以能获得这些成绩，主要是由于以毛主席为首的中国共产党与中央人民政府英明的领导，劳动农民在胜利地完成土地改革后发展生产的积极性，工人阶级对于农业生产的支援，苏联先进经验的指导，各业务部门的密切配合，以及各个地区领导与干部的积极努力，而总起来说，则是我国的人民民主制度的优越性的具体表现。
    但是，我们在工作中也曾发生不少的错误和缺点。
    我国是个地跨几种不同自然区域的大国，各地条件不同，可能发生的水旱灾害也是情况不同的，这些灾害又有特殊性与经常性的不同，在防治上应有不同的对策。同时，目前我国处在过渡时期，国家的社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造都刚在开始，在农村中，小农经济还占优势。这些自然条件和社会条件都决定了水利建设的长期性、广泛性和复杂性。但是过去我们对这些客观情况，缺乏具体的分析，认识上带有片面性，在掌握各地灾情的轻重与治理的先后缓急上，不完全符合各地农业生产的实际需要。
    在进行工程上，带有一定程度的急躁冒进情绪，致对某些大型工程，基本资料研究不足，规划设计不周，造成一些不应有的浪费损失。在施工组织领导方面也钻研不够，多是以手工业的方式进行领导，满足于一般化的布置检查，对施工中的施工组织设计、工场布置、劳动组织、责任制度、技术定额、设备利用、财务管理及安全卫生等问题，还没有总结出一套较成熟的经验。至于已经完成的水库、闸、坝及堤防、河道等工程的管理养护，则一般尚未引起足够的重视，有的工程虽已设立管理机构，但对操作、使用、观测、养护，也都还缺乏健全的制度。
    在灌溉工程上，偏重兴修工程而对灌溉管理注意不够的思想仍未彻底纠正。用水不当的现象普遍存在，影响灌溉效益的充分发挥。
    对群众性农田水利的领导重视不够，并在领导方法上存在着主观主义，研究具体情况不够，盲目地批准计划，偏重于一般号召，缺乏具体指导，也没有交代清楚政策界限与工作方法，致使农村中在打井、贷款等问题上曾产生过强迫命令现象。
    在施工占地及迁移补偿等问题上，个别地区曾有解决不够完善的地方。
    在动员民工问题上，曾有浪费现象，工资标准也有偏高偏低的现象。
    以上这些缺点，主要是由于我们对干部的思想政治领导不够，特别是我们在领导上存在着主观主义和官僚主义所造成的。在中央的正确领导下，这些缺点虽然多数已得到纠正，但是有的仍须继续注意加以改正。
      （二）
    今后水利建设，应根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，在各级党政统一领导下，按照各地具体情况，定出具体的要求和可行的步骤，使水利建设为国家的社会主义工业化与农业的社会主义改造服务，为农业增产，特别是粮食和棉花的增产服务，逐步地战胜水旱灾害，争取逐年有所减轻。
    水利建设必须为总任务服务，防止离开总任务的单纯工程观点。在制订各河的流域规划及各种大型工程的设计时，都应根据当前并预计到将来国家工农业发展的需要与可能条件，照顾全局，统盘考虑，防止脱离实际的片面思想。农田水利工作必须与改造小农经济这个总任务联系起来。通过小型水利来促进农业生产的互助合作，是完全有条件可以办到的。经验证明，有不少农业生产合作社和互助组，由于打了井、开了渠、置了水车，增加了生产，也增加了收入，而更加巩固起来。另一方面也有少数互助合作组织，由于不顾条件盲目地打井开渠，而造成困难，影响了组织的巩固。今后各地应该去掉盲目性，去掉主观主义和命令主义，依据需要和可能的条件，积极地推进农田水利工作，并且有意识地用农田水利工作来促进互助合作。农田水利贷款的发放，更须注意及此。大型灌区及蓄洪垦殖区的水利，除满足国营农场的需要外，并应注意推动农村互助合作运动。
    在工作中，必须加强对实际情况的调查研究，提高计划性，防止盲目性。对于大型水利工程必须采取稳步前进的作法，反对贪多性急，坚持贯彻基本建设程序，加强规划设计及基本工作，并应厉行节约，反对浪费，保证工程质量。在设计与施工中，都应逐步建立责任制度以消除无人负责现象。已完工程的管理运用，是保证每个工程充分发挥应有效益及延长使用年限的重要关键，各地都应加强注意。在开展群众性的水利工程时，必须因地制宜，根据群众需要与可能，并贯彻群众自愿的原则。同时切实整顿现有水利设施，发挥其应有效益。对于群众性的各种小型水利的指导，应与大江大河的治理同样重视。
    正确贯彻政策是动员群众广泛兴修水利的重要关键。今后动员民工兴修水利，必须与农业生产统筹考虑，做到尽量不违农时。民工工资，应根据具体情况由施工单位与出工的当地党政机关订定，经一定领导机关批准后执行。水利施工占地及水库蓄洪区的迁移和补偿等问题，均应遵照政务院“关于国家建设征用土地办法”的规定办理。过去水利贷款中的遗留问题，各地应根据政务院“关于清理农业贷款中若干问题的指示”的精神进行清理。今后水利投资贷款的使用，除大、中型工程应由国家举办并使用投资外，群众性的小型水利应提倡群众自办，如有困难时，可由政府以贷款扶持或以投资补助。投资与贷款的使用应首先注意粮棉产区兴修水利的需要，同时也应适当照顾灾区、贫苦山区、革命老根据地及少数民族区。
    为适应水利建设的需要，必须积极地、有计划地培养干部和加强专业的工程队。全体水利干部应确立长期工作长期学习的决心，认真钻研，逐步地精通业务。为增强水利建设的技术力量，一方面要在学校和工地不断地培养新的技术人才，特别注意培养与提拔工农干部，这是主要的，需要较长时间不断的努力；另一方面必须加强团结与教育现有的技术人员，使之确立诚心诚意为人民服务的观点，深入群众，钻研业务，把科学技术与群众实践经验结合起来，迅速提高思想与业务水平，以便能担负更多的工作，适应当前工作的迫切需要。
    根据上述方针，水利建设的主要具体任务可综合为下列各项：
      （一）黄河的治理。
    为防止异常洪水的袭击，发生严重的决口或改道，造成大的灾害，影响国家的建设部署，必须一方面继续加强堤防岁修与防汛工作，并在上游黄土高原地区积极地有步骤地大力开展水土保持工作，在支流修筑小型水库，以防止土壤冲刷，减少泥沙下泄；一方面积极研究黄河的治本工作，制订黄河的流域规划，根据人力、物力、财力和技术等条件，逐步推行，以期达到消除黄河洪水的威胁，并开发水利。
      （二）长江的治理。
    长江根治更需较长时间，目前应以加强堤防，保障荆江大堤不决口，争取时间再图治本。汉江水库继续比较研究，充分准备，最近几年内先研究采取适当措施，以减轻汉江的洪水负担。研究洞庭湖及中下游湖泊的蓄洪垦殖计划，争取五年内举办一部。长江上游及各重要支流的资料搜集与研究，对于制定长江的流域规划关系甚大，应积极进行。
      （三）继续大力治淮，以减轻这条多灾河流的危害。
    根据治淮的经验，淮河的根治须分两个步骤进行。第一个步骤，着重消除普通暴雨情况下的洪水与内涝灾害，并争取干支堤在遇一九二一年同样的洪水时不致决口泛滥。第二个步骤，消灭非常洪水并统筹开发水利。沂、沭、汶、泗已列入治淮的范围内，其治理步骤参照治淮步骤研究决定。
      （四）继续永定河的治理，开始辽河的治理。为了减轻辽河洪水灾害，首先在支流浑河上举办大伙房水库，要求在第一个五年计划内完成，其余各支流则先搜集资料，制订流域规划，成熟后择要举办。其他为患严重的河道如河北的南运河、山东的徒骇、马颊河等亦应适当整治，求得在普通暴雨情况下减轻洪水与内涝灾害。对各地一般河流，也要求在目前保证水位下不溃堤。
      （五）地方水利工作应以整理与巩固现有工程，开展中小型农田水利为重点，培养人民的抗灾能力，为农业增产服务。特别注意使小型农田水利工作与农业生产互助合作运动结合起来。
    应该充分估计群众性小型水利对增产粮食所起的重要作用。在互助合作运动日益发展的条件下，群众对兴修水利的要求必将更加提高，因此各省水利厅、局应在当地党政领导下着重加强对群众性小型水利的领导。在有条件的地区，亦可适当发展中型灌溉、排水工程。根据过去经验，加强县的领导是开展群众性小型水利工作的重要关键。为此，今后应逐步输送技术干部充实县的建设部门，并配置专做水利工作的行政干部。技术干部的来源，一方面由各地中等技术学校与部分高级学校的毕业生中解决一部，但更重要的还是在实际工作中大量培养提拔群众中的积极分子、技术人才和农村干部。省水利厅、局对群众性水利应加强方针政策及技术的指导。开办适当的训练班，培养基层技术干部，及时总结交流经验，并特别注意总结典型经验。
    对于大型灌溉工程，应着重加强现有工程的管理，克服脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义现象，发掘潜在力量，提高灌溉效益。对新办工程应采取慎重态度，充分准备，稳步前进，择要举办。
    各省水利厅、局应有一个主要负责干部专管群众性水利工作。在灌溉较多的省份，也应有一个主要负责干部分工领导灌溉管理工作。加强用水管理，以避免用水浪费，防止土地碱化，并扩大灌溉面积。在水土流失严重地区，水利机构应密切配合农林牧及科学研究等有关部门有步骤地推行水土保持工作。
      （六）解决已完工程的遗留问题。
      （七）对于工业建设中需要解决的有关水利的问题，各级水利机关应在技术上负责协助。国营农场是推动农业的社会主义改造的杠杆，水利部门应与农业部门积极配合，尽力解决农场水利建设的需要。抽水机站是农业合作化、机械化的工具之一，各地都有需要，尤其在江南水稻地区更应加以重视，要有计划地重点试办，然后逐步推广。
    为了做好以上各项工作，完成水利建设的任务，必须在各级水利机构中加强思想与政治领导，认真学习国家总任务，掌握总任务的精神与实质，并把它贯彻到工作的各个方面中去，加强全局观点，加强群众观念，在反对主观主义与官僚主义的基础上，为农业增产，特别是粮食与棉花的增产服务，为国家社会主义建设服务。（新华社）
