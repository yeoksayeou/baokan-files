Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th: A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is vigorously assisting the Korean people in rebuilding Sariwon City, Hwanghae Province.

　　Sariwon City is located between Pyongyang and Kaesong. Before the war, it was a beautiful city with factories producing textiles, flour, rice, and matches, as well as large, medium, and primary schools, state-run stores, hospitals, and cinemas. During the war, the U.S. invading air force indiscriminately bombed the city, completely destroying 94% of the buildings and killing more than 1,400 citizens.

　　After the armistice, the people of Sariwon City immediately began to rebuild their city. A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which had established meritorious service during the war, also participated in this reconstruction project in early May this year. More than 1,800 of them work with the Korean people every day. The soldiers participating in the construction of a brick and tile factory worked in two shifts, day and night, from the second day of construction, and now the factory is nearing completion. The soldiers participating in the construction of the pasture ran to the mountains hundreds of meters away to carry stones. Xu Jinchun, a sniper and Communist Party member who killed a hundred enemies in the cold gun war, exceeded the quota by more than double the amount of mud he dug on the first day.

　　During the days of intense labor, the Volunteer Army soldiers and the Korean people were closely united, encouraging and learning from each other. The Volunteer Army soldiers humbly learned various construction techniques from the Korean workers, and the Korean workers also educated and encouraged themselves with the Volunteer Army's lofty spirit of internationalism. Oh In-suk, a Korean woman who was originally a textile worker, became a bricklayer when the work required it and completed the task excellently.

　　Now, Sariwon City is increasingly showing a new look. Thousands of bomb craters have been filled, and more than 2,000 houses have been built. The office building of the Hwanghae Provincial People's Committee is under construction, and a conference hall that can accommodate more than 700 people has been renovated. The school buildings of many schools and 364 workers' dormitories are also under construction. According to the basic plan for rebuilding Sariwon City made by the relevant authorities in Hwanghae Province, after long-term construction, the area of ​​Sariwon City will be more than double its original size, and it will become a new city with a population of 100,000, focusing on agricultural product processing.

　　志愿军某部协助朝鲜人民重建沙里院市
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】中国人民志愿军某部正大力帮助朝鲜人民重建黄海道沙里院市。
    沙里院市在平壤和开城之间，战前是一座美丽的城市，有纺织、面粉、碾米和火柴等工厂，有大、中、小学校和国营商店、医院、电影院等。战争期间，美国侵朝空军向这座城市滥施轰炸，把全市百分之九十四的建筑物彻底摧毁，被炸死的市民有一千四百多人。
    停战后，沙里院市的人民便立即着手重建自己的城市。曾在战争中建立功勋的中国人民志愿军某部也在今年五月上旬参加了这一重建工程。他们每天都有一千八百多人和朝鲜人民一起劳动。参加修筑一座砖瓦厂的战士们，从开工的第二天起就分成日夜两班工作，现在这座工厂已接近完工了。参加建设牧场的战士们跑到几百公尺以外的山上去抬石头。在冷枪战中杀敌百名的狙击手、共产党员徐进春，第一天挖的泥土就超过定额一倍多。
    在紧张劳动的日子里，志愿军战士和朝鲜人民亲密团结，互相鼓舞和学习。志愿军战士向朝鲜工人虚心地学习各种建筑技术，朝鲜工人们也以志愿军崇高的国际主义精神教育和鼓舞自己。原来是纺织女工的朝鲜妇女吴仁淑，在工作需要时便当了泥水匠，并且出色地完成了任务。
    现在，沙里院市正日益呈现出新的面貌。数千个弹坑填平了，两千多幢房屋已经建筑起来。黄海道人民委员会的办公大楼正在施工，可以容纳七百多人的会议厅已修整一新。许多学校的校舍和三百六十四幢工人宿舍也在修建中。根据黄海道有关机关所作的重建沙里院市的基本计划，沙里院市经过长期建设后，它的面积将比原来扩大一倍以上，将成为一座拥有十万人口的以农产物加工业为主的新城市。
