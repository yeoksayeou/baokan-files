Column: Summary of Readers' Letters

    The serious crimes of certain postal workers, exposed in the "Summary of Readers' Letters" column on April 8th, involving embezzlement of remittances from revolutionary soldiers and withholding letters to revolutionary soldiers' families, have aroused the indignation of the broad masses of readers. Readers from Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaodong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guizhou, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have successively written letters expressing their opinions, demanding that postal and telecommunications departments in various regions eliminate corruption and theft and prevent similar situations from continuing to occur.

    Readers Jiang Weiping, Luan Fawen, Shen Xiangcheng, Xiang Youcheng, Huo Shengshan, Jingguan, Shen Yi, and others wrote: The Chinese People's Volunteers fought heroically on the Korean front, defeated the American imperialist aggression, defended the security of the motherland, and made great contributions to safeguarding world peace. The Chinese People's Liberation Army vigilantly guards the borders, coastal defenses, and air defenses of the motherland, strictly preventing enemy sabotage and protecting the safe construction of a socialist society in the motherland. The people of the whole country express their gratitude and love for their great and noble virtues, and show the utmost respect and concern for their families. Some soldiers save on food and clothing to accumulate allowances and consolation money to send back to help their families solve difficulties in production and life. Such revolutionary morality is even more moving! However, Zhao Guangfu, Zhu Junzhi, Quan Bangqing, and others have embezzled the remittances of our most beloved people, making it impossible to solve the difficulties in production and life of revolutionary soldiers' families in a timely manner; they even withheld letters from revolutionary soldiers, obstructing the contact between revolutionary soldiers and their families. Such serious illegal acts cannot but make people feel extremely hateful.

    Readers Li Xiaolin, Zheng Bangzhi, Zeng Bingchao, Zhang Yong, and others said in their letters: People's postal workers travel over mountains and rivers, braving wind and rain, tirelessly enabling people to receive letters from their relatives in a timely manner, and to receive the newspapers and periodicals they need for learning in a timely manner. Some postal workers, in order to find the recipients of letters with unclear names and addresses, enable some relatives who have been separated for many years and do not know each other's whereabouts to re-establish contact. These postal workers who wholeheartedly serve the people are supported by the people. However, the crimes of lawless elements like Zhao Guangfu, Zhu Junzhi, and Quan Bangqing not only harm the interests of the people, but also damage the reputation of the people's postal service. Wang Qi, an employee of the Guiyang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, and Han Fenglin, a staff member of the Inner Mongolia Postal Bureau, stated in their letters that postal and telecommunications workers cannot tolerate such bad behavior and are determined to remove these bad elements to ensure the purity and reliability of the people's postal team. Although such lawless elements are a minority among postal workers, they are not isolated cases. Reader Zhu Yuancheng reflected in his letter that the Hubei Daily recently published a report on the serious crime of He Dianqing, a postal worker in Macheng County, who withheld 158 letters and embezzled more than 11.3 million yuan in remittances, and was punished accordingly. After the "Three-Anti" movement, such illegal acts of embezzling remittances must not be allowed to continue. Postal organs in various regions must strengthen the education of their staff in serving the people, and after discovering illegal acts of embezzling remittances, they should promptly and seriously handle them. The broad masses of postal workers should also assist the leadership in eliminating corruption and theft and resolutely fight against corruption.

### 邮电部门应该肃清贪污盗窃

专栏：读者来信摘要

    邮电部门应该肃清贪污盗窃
    四月八日“读者来信摘要”栏中揭发的某些邮政人员贪污革命军人汇款、扣留革命军人家信的严重罪恶行为，激起了广大读者的愤慨。北京、河北、山西、辽东、河南、湖北、江苏、山东、贵州和内蒙古自治区等地不少读者先后来信提出他们的意见，要求各地邮电部门肃清贪污盗窃，杜绝类似情况继续发生。
    读者姜维平、栾法文、申相成、向有成、霍省三、锦官、沈沂等来信说：中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇战斗，打败了美帝国主义的侵略，保卫了祖国安全，对保卫世界和平也有很大贡献；中国人民解放军警惕地守卫着祖国的边疆、海防和空防，严防着敌人的破坏行动，保卫祖国安全地建设社会主义社会。全国人民对于他们的伟大崇高的德行，无不表示感激和爱戴，并对他们的家属表示无上的尊敬和关怀。有些战士省吃俭用地把津贴费和慰问金积储起来，寄回去帮助家庭解决生产和生活中的困难，这种革命道德更是多么令人感动！而赵广福、朱俊志、全邦清等人竟然把我们最可爱的人的汇款盗用了，使革命军人家属生产和生活的困难不能及时解决；甚至还扣留革命军人的家信，阻隔革命军人和他们家属之间的联系。这种严重违法行为不能不使人感到极度的痛恨。
    读者李孝麟、郑邦治、曾柄超、张勇等在来信中说：人民邮政工作人员跋山涉水、冒风沐雨，不辞辛劳地使人们能够及时得到亲人寄来的书信，及时收到他们学习需要的报刊；有些邮政人员为了把收件人姓名、地址书写不明的信件也能找到收件人，使某些离别多年互相不知下落的亲人们又能建立联系。这些热心为人民服务的邮政人员都受到人民的拥护。但是，像赵广福、朱俊志、全邦清这类不法分子的罪恶行为，不但危害了人民的利益，而且也有损人民邮政事业的信誉。贵阳邮电局职工王棨、内蒙古邮政局工作人员韩凤林在来信中表示：邮电工作人员不能容忍这种恶劣行为，决心把这些坏分子清除出去，以保证人民邮电队伍的纯洁可靠。这种不法分子在邮政人员中虽然是少数，但还不是个别的。读者朱元成在来信中就反映：湖北日报最近曾发表了麻城县邮政人员何殿卿扣压信件一百五十八封、盗窃汇款一千一百三十多万元的严重罪行受到制裁的情况。在“三反”运动以后，这种贪污汇款的违法行为是决不能容许继续存在了。各地邮政机关必须对所属工作人员加强为人民服务的教育，发现不法分子贪污汇款的行为后，应该及时加以严肃处理，广大邮政工作人员也应该协助领导方面肃清贪污盗窃，坚决和贪污行为作斗争。
