The entire staff of the rolling mill workshop of Daye Steel Plant successfully created the "anti-upright collar" after Zhang Mingshan created the "anti-collar". After being put into production, it improved the high-temperature working conditions of the rolling mill workshop and increased productivity. Xinhua News Agency reporter Ke Shanwen photo

Anshan Iron and Steel Company's special-class labor model and famous production innovator Wang Chonglun (right), under the education of the Party, created the "universal tool tire" through collective strength. Originally, the quota for making a card actuator on a slotting machine was three and a half hours. Wang Chonglun used the "universal tool tire" to produce it on a planer, shortening the time to forty-five minutes. Later, he learned from Wei Yuxi's advanced experience in saving auxiliary time and reduced it to nineteen minutes and two seconds. The quality is all first-class. This is him helping others find tricks.

Anshan Iron and Steel Company's special-class labor model and deputy director of the Anshan Small Rolling Mill Zhang Mingshan, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, created the "anti-collar", which not only improved the harsh working conditions and eliminated occupational diseases, but also improved the quantity and quality of products. Soviet experts commented on Zhang Mingshan's creation: The creation of the anti-collar has a world status and should be valued by people all over the world. *Northeast Daily* Na Yi photo

Zhuang Minggeng, a worker at Qishuyan Locomotive Factory, improved his operating methods, improved tools, and strengthened production planning. In 1953, he completed twenty-five months and ten days of tasks in one year, with good quality and no accidents for a long time.

Anshan Iron and Steel Company's labor model and assistant engineer of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Power Plant, Liu Zuwei (left), has made thirteen relatively significant creations and rationalization proposals in recent years, which have played a significant role in ensuring the power supply of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and reducing power outages. This is him inspecting the automatic generator adjustment device he created. *Northeast Daily* Na Yi photo

Comrades Tang Liyan, Cheng Yuanqin, and Deng Yongchun, under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, changed the original method of forging anchor chains and successfully cast anchor chains, which made a significant contribution to my country's shipbuilding industry. *Luda People's Daily* Manuscript Liu Peiteng photo

Li Bingzhong, a young planer at Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, actively studied Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation and created a relatively complete set of "small planer work methods", shortening production auxiliary time and giving full play to machine efficiency. In April, he completed the equivalent of fifty-one working days in twenty-one working days. *Xinhua Daily* Manuscript Li Rongqing photo

Fu Jingwen, a special-class labor model of Wuhan City and deputy section chief of the production scheduling section of Factory 201, learned from advanced Soviet experience and created a "assembly line operation method" for clothing production, which increased the factory's output by 25%, and the product quality was also significantly improved. More importantly, it transformed clothing production from manual production to mass production. *Changjiang Daily* Manuscript Chen Qi photo

Zhu Shunyu (right), a planer at the state-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, has improved 24 tools in the past two years, increasing production efficiency by one to eighteen times, without any defective products or work-related injuries. This is him and his apprentice Wang Fengxiu studying production drawings. *Labor Daily* Wang Chaozhen photo

Chen Hongzhi, a young female worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, under the leadership of the Party and the specific guidance of master worker Yang Weizong, improved the tooling of the planer. It originally took sixteen hours to plane an eight-character gear, but now it only takes two hours and fifty minutes. With reasonable arrangement of working hours, work efficiency has increased by more than four and a half times. Wang Yibo photo

Huang Baomei, a national textile industry model and young spinning worker at the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory, has achieved remarkable results in learning the Hao Jianxiu work method. She watches eight hundred spindles, spins 21.5 counts of yarn, and the roller flower rate is 0.259%. *Labor Daily* Wang Chaozhen photo

Cao Chunshan, an old worker at the rolling mill workshop of Kunming Wire Factory, and technicians cooperated to mechanize the main equipment of the workshop, improve working conditions, and improve the quantity and quality of products. *Yunnan Daily* Manuscript

    开展技术革命运动，加速社会主义工业化的进程
    大冶钢厂轧钢车间全体职工继张明山创造“反围盘”后创造了“反立围盘”获得成功。投入生产后改善了轧钢车间的高温作业条件，提高了生产率。新华社记者　柯善文摄
    鞍山市特等劳动模范、著名的生产革新者王崇伦（右）在党的教育下通过集体力量创造了“万能工具胎”。原来在插床上做一个卡动器的定额是三点半钟，王崇伦使用“万能工具胎”，在刨床上生产，缩短为四十五分钟。后来他学习了韦玉玺节省辅助时间的先进经验，又减到十九分零两秒钟。质量都是一级品。这是他在帮助别人找窍门。
    鞍山市特等劳动模范、鞍钢小型轧钢厂副厂长张明山在党的领导和苏联专家帮助下所创造的“反围盘”，不仅改善了恶劣的劳动条件，消灭了职业病，而且提高了产品的数量和质量。苏联专家对张明山的创举的评价是：反围盘的创造是有世界地位的，应受到世界人民的重视。　东北日报　纳一摄
    戚墅堰机车厂工人庄铭耕改进操作方法，改良工具，加强生产计划性，在一九五三年一年中完成了二十五个月零十天的任务，质量好而且长期没有事故。
    鞍山市劳动模范、鞍钢发电厂助理工程师刘祖威（左），几年来有十三件比较重大的创造和合理化建议，对保证鞍钢供电、减少停电事故，起了重大作用。这是他在检查他所创造的发电量自动调整器。东北日报　纳一摄
    唐立言、程远钦、邓永春等同志在苏联专家具体指导下，改变原有的锻造锚链的方法，铸造锚链成功，对我国造船工业有着重大贡献。旅大人民日报稿　刘培腾摄
    重庆空气压缩机厂青年刨工李秉中积极学习王崇伦生产革新精神，创造了一套比较完整的“小刨工作法”，缩短了生产辅助时间，充分发挥了机器效能。在四月份他以二十一个工作日完成了相当于五十一个工作日的任务。　新华日报稿　李荣卿摄
    武汉市特等劳动模范、二○一厂生产调度科副科长傅景文学习苏联先进经验，创造被服生产“流水作业法”，提高了全厂产量百分之二十五，产品质量也显著提高。更重要的是使被服生产由手工生产变成了大生产。长江日报稿　陈七摄
    国营上海汽轮机厂刨工朱顺馀（右），两年来改进工具达二十四件，提高生产效率一倍到十八倍，没有出废品和工伤事故。这是他和徒工王凤秀在研究生产图样。劳动报　王朝祯摄
    石景山钢铁厂青年女工陈鸿芝在党的领导下，在老师傅杨维宗的具体指导下，改进了刨床的刀具。原先刨一个八字齿轮需要十六小时，现在只用两小时五十分，加上合理地安排工作时间，工作效率提高了四倍半以上。　王一波摄
    全国纺织工业模范、国营上海第十七棉纺织厂青年挡车工黄宝妹，学习郝建秀工作法获得显著成绩。她看八百个纱锭，纺二十一点五支纱，皮辊花率为百分之零点二五九。
