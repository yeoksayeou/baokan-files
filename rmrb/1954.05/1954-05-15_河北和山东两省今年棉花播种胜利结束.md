Hebei and Shandong Provinces Successfully Complete Cotton Planting This Year

[Reported by this newspaper] The cotton planting in Hebei Province has been successfully completed. According to preliminary statistics as of May 11, the cotton planting area in the province has reached more than 16,140,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by more than 140,000 mu, and expanding by more than 2,340,000 mu compared with last year. The five special districts of Handan, Xingtai, Baoding, Cangxian, and Tongxian have all exceeded their original plans for cotton planting.

This year's cotton planting in Hebei Province was completed after in-depth ideological mobilization, strengthening the supply of materials, and overcoming the difficulties of drought. The main obstacle encountered in the planting work was the contradiction between farmers' self-sufficiency ideology and the state planned economy. In addition, the lack of rain contributed to the farmers' idea of reducing cotton fields. To this end, various parts of Hebei Province have successively adopted effective measures. Before the spring plowing and sowing, various localities, in conjunction with guiding farmers to prepare for sowing, generally helped farmers formulate and revise cotton planting plans, and expanded the cotton planting area. All localities gave full play to the exemplary leading role of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, first helping them revise their cotton planting plans, and then using them to help and lead farmers to revise their cotton planting plans. For example, in Jianguo County, after persuasion and education at the conference of chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives, 644 cooperatives expanded from the original plan of planting more than 5,500 mu of cotton to more than 10,900 mu. Major cotton-producing areas have successively transferred a large number of cadres, led by the main responsible cadres, to strengthen specific leadership in the countryside. According to incomplete statistics, the province, special district, and county levels dispatched a total of more than 15,000 cadres to the countryside during the spring plowing and sowing period. When the cotton planting season arrived in mid-April, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ma Guorui, Second Secretary, and Ruan Boisheng, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, also went to the countryside to supervise and inspect, which greatly promoted the cotton planting work.

(Xinhua News Agency) Shandong Province has basically completed the planting of more than 10 million mu of cotton. In the western region, where sowing started earlier, cotton has grown tender leaves, and farmers are about to thin and weed.

This year, farmers in the four major cotton-producing special districts of Liaocheng, Dezhou, Huimin, and Heze in Shandong Province have appropriately expanded their cotton fields according to the needs of the state and local conditions. Jiaozhou, Tai'an, Changwei and other special districts have also maintained last year's cotton planting area. In order to make the cotton mature earlier, farmers in Liaocheng, Huimin, Heze and other special districts have advanced the sowing time by more than ten days compared with previous years. More than 80% of the more than 10 million mu of cotton that has been planted in the province are high-quality cotton varieties such as "Si Zi Wu Ai" and "Si Zi Er Bi". Most agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in Liaocheng, Dezhou, Jiaozhou, Heze and other special districts also carried out seed selection and seed dressing with pesticides before sowing. In Bin County, Guangrao, Wudi and other coastal counties in the north of Huimin Special District, farmers actively adopted methods such as scraping alkali and increasing the amount of sowing to ensure the completeness and vigor of cotton seedlings in alkali land.

### 河北和山东两省今年棉花播种胜利结束

    河北和山东两省今年棉花播种胜利结束
    【本报讯】河北省的棉田播种，已经胜利完成。到五月十一日的初步统计，全省棉田播种面积已达一千六百一十四万多亩，超过原计划十四万多亩，比去年扩大二百三十四万多亩。邯郸、邢台、保定、沧县、通县等五个专区已经播种的棉田，都超过了原计划。
    今年河北省的棉田播种，是在经过深入的思想发动、加强物资供应工作和克服天旱困难的情况下完成的。在播种工作中，遇到的主要障碍是农民的自给自足思想与国家计划经济的矛盾，加以雨水缺少，助长了农民缩小棉田的思想。为此，河北省各地先后采取了有效的措施。在春耕播种以前，各地结合领导农民进行播种准备工作，普遍帮助农民制订和修订了种棉计划，扩大了棉田面积。各地充分发挥了互助合作组织的模范带头作用，先帮助他们修订种棉计划，然后再通过他们去帮助和带动农民修订种棉计划。如建国县在农业生产合作社社长会议上，经过说服教育，六百四十四个社由原计划种棉五千五百多亩扩大到一万零九百多亩。各产棉区先后抽调了大批干部，由主要负责干部率领下乡加强具体领导。据不完全统计，省、专区、县三级在春耕播种期中，抽调下乡的干部共达一万五千多名。当四月中旬棉田播种季节来到以后，中共河北省委书记林铁、第二书记马国瑞和河北省人民政府副主席阮泊生等主要负责同志也下乡督促和检查，对植棉工作起了很大的推动作用。
    据新华社讯：山东省一千多万亩棉花播种已基本结束。下种较早的西部地区，棉花已长出嫩叶，农民即将间苗和锄草。
    今年，山东省主要产棉区聊城、德州、惠民和菏泽四个专区的农民，都根据国家的需要和当地可能条件，适当扩大了棉田。胶州、泰安、昌潍等专区也保持了去年的植棉面积。为使棉花提前成熟，聊城、惠民、菏泽等专区的农民都把播种时间比往年提前了十多天。全省已播种的一千多万亩棉花，百分之八十以上是“斯字五爱”和“斯字二比”等优良棉种。聊城、德州、胶州、菏泽等专区的大部分农业生产合作社和互助组，在播种前还进行了粒选棉种和药剂拌种。惠民专区北部沿海的滨县、广饶、无棣等县，农民们都积极采用刮碱和增加播种量等办法，保证碱地棉苗齐全旺盛。
