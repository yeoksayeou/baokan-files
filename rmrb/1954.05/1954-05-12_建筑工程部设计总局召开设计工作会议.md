The Design Bureau of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering recently held a design work conference. Participants included responsible cadres such as deans of design institutes, managers of design companies, and heads of design departments. The conference summarized the design work of 1953, clearly put forward the basic tasks for 1954: conscientiously complete existing general building design tasks, actively complete the design of factory pre-construction areas and welfare areas for major national projects, and gradually learn architectural design of factory buildings with the help of Soviet experts. All design units must, on the basis of continuing to improve the political consciousness of technical personnel, vigorously promote and strengthen planned management, establish technical management, improve design quality, correspondingly establish and improve organizational structures, systematically cultivate industrial design forces, balance trades, strengthen standard design and establish design budgets, and strive to comprehensively complete the tasks of 1954.

The conference also exchanged experiences in planned management and political and ideological leadership. Attendees further recognized the great significance of promoting planned management and establishing socialist design thinking.

The conference also studied technical measures to reduce construction costs, pointing out the direction for future efforts to increase production and practice economy in design work.

    中央建筑工程部设计总局最近举行了一次设计工作会议。参加的有设计院院长、设计公司经理和设计处处长等负责干部。会议总结了一九五三年的设计工作，明确提出了一九五四年的基本任务：认真做好现有一般建筑设计任务，积极完成国家重大工程厂前区、福利区的设计，并在苏联专家的帮助下逐步学会工厂厂房的建筑设计。各设计单位必须在继续提高技术人员政治觉悟的基础上，大力推行与加强计划管理，建立技术管理，提高设计质量，相应地建立与健全组织机构，有计划地培养工业设计力量，平衡工种，加强标准设计与建立设计预算工作，为全面完成一九五四年的任务而努力。
    会议并交流了计划管理和政治思想领导方面的经验。到会人员进一步认识到推行计划管理，建立社会主义设计思想的重大意义。
    会议并对降低建筑造价的技术措施作了研究，给今后在设计工作中开展增产节约指出了方向。
