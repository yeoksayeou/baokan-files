    The Third National Supervisory Work Conference
    Determined the Guiding Principles and Tasks for Future Supervisory Work
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council held the Third National Supervisory Work Conference from April 5th to 20th to adapt the supervision work to the needs of the national transition period. Based on the general task of the national transition period and summarizing the work of 1953, the conference determined the guiding principles and tasks for future supervisory work. The conference was attended by 142 people, including the directors, deputy directors, secretaries-generals, and supervisory commissioners of the supervision committees of the major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and various provinces and cities, as well as the directors and deputy directors of the supervision offices of the various ministries of the Central People's Government.
    Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council, delivered a report on the summary of the People's Supervision work in 1953 and the tasks for the future, while Deputy Directors Wang Han and Pan Zhenya respectively delivered reports on the work of the supervision offices of the financial and economic departments and the handling of people's letters and reception of people. At the meeting, Zhang Muyao, Director of the General Office of the People's Supervision Committee of the Administrative Council, also gave an introduction on the experience of supervision work at the Harbin Qiulin Company, and Ye Keming, Chief Auditor of the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau, gave an introduction on the experience of supervision work at the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau.
    According to the summary report of Deputy Director Liu Jingfan and the materials provided in the discussions, the people's supervision organs at all levels have achieved significant results in organizational construction and work development over the past year. Combining the central tasks such as national economic construction, they have cooperated with relevant departments to conduct more than 6,000 key inspections on basic construction, production management, material allocation and storage, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, flood prevention and disaster relief, forest protection and fire prevention, financial system, tax policy, grain purchase, sales, storage and transportation, safe production, maintaining state secrets, implementing the election law, culture, education and health, and other aspects of work. They have exposed and corrected many shortcomings and errors in government agencies and enterprise departments, analyzed the root causes of the problems, and helped to improve the work. They have also conducted serious struggles and necessary punishments for illegal and dereliction of duty by state organs and their staff, and handled a large number of reports and accusations, thereby effectively combating bad people and bad deeds, supporting good people and good deeds, safeguarding state discipline, removing many obstacles in the work, and preventing and reducing accidents, waste and losses in production, thus playing a certain guaranteeing role in the implementation of national policies and laws and the completion of economic construction plans. In the past year, the supervision organs have received approximately twice as many letters and visits from the people as in 1952, further strengthening the ties between the government and the people.
    The conference also seriously examined the shortcomings that still exist in the work. The main shortcomings are insufficient work in combining with the central tasks, grasping the main trends, and concentrating efforts in a planned and organized manner for supervision and inspection; insufficient initiative in understanding the situation, discovering problems, and organizing inspections in the supervision and inspection of economic construction; some supervisory organs even completely ignored the supervision and inspection of economic construction, and were only busy handling general cases; in handling people's reports and accusations, some supervisory organs had backlogs, delays, and perfunctory handling; in the work of punishment, there was also a lack of good summary of experience and determination of some principles of punishment, resulting in excessive or too many punishments for lower-level cadres in certain regions and departments, or phenomena where punishments should have been given but were not given; some supervisory personnel failed to adhere to principles well in inspection work, or were subjective and one-sided, complacent, disrespectful to local party and government leaders, and unwilling to listen to the opinions of the inspected organs and personnel.
    Based on the general task of the national transition period, the conference determined the specific tasks of supervision work in the future: First, to supervise and inspect the implementation of various policies and laws of the state during the transition period, with particular emphasis on supervising and inspecting the implementation of the policy of realizing socialist industrialization, the policy of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the policy of developing cooperative economy, transforming agriculture and handicrafts, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, as well as policies on unified purchase and sale of grain, finance and taxation, commercial trade, etc. Second, to supervise and inspect the implementation of the state construction plan, and in light of the actual situation and specific conditions, gradually implement regular and comprehensive pre- and post-supervision and inspection of the management of financial and economic enterprises, production, economic and financial plans (including engineering construction plans), receipt, expenditure, safekeeping and use of assets, and the establishment and implementation of economic accounting systems. Third, to conscientiously accept and handle the people's reports and accusations against illegal and derelict acts of state organs and their staff, and to supervise the people's governments at all levels and government departments to implement the system of receiving the people and handling people's letters.
    The conference stipulated the priorities for supervision and inspection by people's supervision organs at all levels: the central and major administrative region supervision organs should focus on supervising and inspecting the central and regional financial and economic organs and state-owned enterprise departments; the provincial (municipal) and province-administered municipal people's supervision organs should focus on supervising and inspecting the provincial (municipal) and province-administered municipal financial and economic organs and local state-owned departments; the prefectural and county people's supervision organs should focus on supervising and inspecting the implementation of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation policies and the purchase and storage of grain, cotton, and other materials.
    In addition, the conference also focused on discussing the issue of gradually promoting the experience of supervision work of the Harbin Railway Audit Bureau. The conference decided to adopt the principle of active leadership, steady progress, key preparation, and key pilot implementation, first select key pilot implementation within 1954, and gradually promote it after gaining experience. Departments that have not yet conducted pilot implementation should actively prepare in terms of cadre allocation and absorption of experience, and in the promotion, they should oppose both conservative thinking and rash advancement.
    During the conference, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the Administrative Council of the Central People's Government, gave important instructions on the supervision work. He particularly emphasized that the experience of supervision work should be summarized little by little in the future to become systematic experience; and called on supervision staff to conscientiously study the general line and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee, so that their thinking style and work requirements are adapted to each other; and asked the supervisory work cadres to be vigilant against the ideology of authority and complacency.
    The conference was finally summarized by Deputy Director Liu Jingfan. In addition to pointing out the gains and shortcomings of the conference and further elaborating on the guiding principles, tasks and working methods of future supervision work, the summary particularly pointed out: the supervision organs at all levels should combine the transmission of this conference with the spirit of the instructions of the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, and conscientiously examine the thinking style of the supervisory personnel. Director Liu Jingfan emphasized: Because the supervision organs are supervising others, they must be particularly strict with themselves, always maintain a cautious and serious attitude and a selfless and realistic style, and must strictly criticize the style of self-righteousness, complacency and imperial envoys.

    第三次全国监察工作会议
    确定今后监察工作的方针和任务
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会为使监察工作适应国家过渡时期的需要，四月五日到二十日举行了第三次全国监察工作会议。会议根据国家过渡时期的总任务，总结了一九五三年的工作，确定了今后监察工作的方针和任务。出席会议的有各大行政区、内蒙古自治区、各省、市监察委员会的主任、副主任、秘书长、监察专员，和中央人民政府各部监察室主任、副主任等一百四十二人。
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会刘景范副主任在会上作了关于一九五三年人民监察工作总结及今后工作任务的报告，王翰、潘震亚副主任分别作了关于财经部门监察室工作、处理人民来信和接见人民工作的报告。会上还有政务院人民监察委员会张慕尧厅长关于哈尔滨秋林公司监察工作经验的介绍，和哈尔滨铁路稽核局总稽核叶克明关于哈尔滨铁路稽核局监察工作经验的介绍。
    根据刘景范副主任的总结报告和讨论中提供的材料，各级人民监察机关一年来在组织建设和工作开展方面，都获得了显著的成绩。它们结合国家经济建设等各项中心工作，协同有关部门，对基本建设、生产管理、物资调运保管、农业生产互助合作、防汛救灾、护林防火、财政制度、税收政策、粮食购销储运、安全生产、保守国家机密、贯彻选举法、文教卫生等各方面工作，进行了六千多次重点检查，揭发和纠正了许多政府机关、企业部门的缺点和错误，分析了问题产生的根源，并帮助改进了工作。对于国家机关及其工作人员中的违法失职行为，也进行了严肃的斗争和必要的惩戒，处理了大批检举控告案件，从而有力地打击了坏人坏事，支持了好人好事，维护了国家纪律，扫除了许多工作上的障碍，防止和减少了生产中的事故、浪费和损失，因而对国家政策法令的贯彻和经济建设计划的完成，起了一定的保证作用。一年来监察机关受理了比一九五二年增加约一倍以上的人民来信和来访，进一步密切了政府和人民的联系。
    会议也认真检查了工作中还存在的缺点。这主要是在结合中心工作、抓住主要倾向、有计划有组织地集中力量进行监督检查方面作得不够；在经济建设的监督检查上，主动地了解情况、发现问题和组织检查也作得不够，有的监察机关甚至根本忽视了对经济建设的监督检查，而只是忙于处理一般案件；在处理人民检举控告工作上，有些监察机关有积压拖延和处理草率现象；在惩戒工作上，也还没有很好地总结经验，确定一些惩戒的原则，以致某些地区和部门对下层干部处分偏重、偏多，或有应该处分而未予处分的现象；有些监察人员在检查工作中未能很好地坚持原则，或者主观片面，骄傲自满，不尊重地方党政领导，不虚心听取被检查机关及人员的意见等。
    会议根据国家过渡时期的总任务，确定今后监察工作的具体任务是：一、监督检查国家在过渡时期的各种政策法令的贯彻执行，特别着重对实行社会主义工业化的政策，改造资本主义工商业的政策，发展合作经济，改造农业、手工业和巩固工农联盟的政策，以及粮食统购统销、财政税收、商业贸易等政策的执行情况进行监督检查。二、监督检查国家建设计划的执行，结合实际情况，根据具体条件，逐步地实行对财经企业部门的经营管理，生产经济财务计划（包括工程建设计划），资财收支、保管、使用以及经济核算制的建立和执行等情况的经常全面的事先与事后的监督检查。三、认真接受与处理人民群众对国家机关和工作人员违法失职行为的检举控告，并监督各级人民政府和政府各部门贯彻接见人民和处理人民来信的制度。
    会议规定了各级人民监察机关实行监督检查的重点：中央和大行政区监察机关，以监督检查中央和大区财经机关和国营企业部门为主；省（市）和省辖市人民监察机关，以监督检查省（市）和省辖市财经机关和地方国营部门为主；专署和县人民监察机关，应着重监督检查农业生产互助合作政策的贯彻执行以及粮食、棉花等物资的收购、保管等工作。
    此外，会议还着重讨论了逐步推行哈尔滨铁路稽核局监察工作经验的问题。会议确定采取积极领导、稳步前进、重点准备、重点试行的方针，在一九五四年内先选择重点试行，取得经验后再逐步推广。没有试办的部门应在干部配备和吸取经验方面积极进行准备，在推广中既要反对保守思想，也要反对急躁冒进情绪。
    会议期间，中央人民政府政务院习仲勋秘书长到会对监察工作作了重要指示。他特别强调今后应把监察工作的经验一滴一点地总结起来，成为系统的经验；并号召监察工作人员认真学习总路线和党的四中全会文件，使自己的思想作风和工作的要求相适应；要求监察工作干部警惕权威思想和骄傲自满情绪。
    会议最后由刘景范副主任作总结。总结除指出会议的收获和缺点、进一步阐述了今后监察工作的方针任务和工作方法等问题以外，特别指出：各级监察机关应结合这次会议的传达，根据中共七届四中全会文件指示的精神，认真检查监察人员的思想作风。刘景范主任强调说：因为监察机关是监察别人的，所以对自己就必须特别严格，经常保持谨慎严肃的态度和大公无私、实事求是的作风，必须严格批判那种自以为是、骄傲自满和钦差大臣的作风。
