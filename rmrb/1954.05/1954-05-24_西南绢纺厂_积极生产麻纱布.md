    Southwest Silk Weaving Factory
    Actively Produces Linen Cloth
    The workers of the Southwest Silk Weaving Factory, in order to enable the people of the Southwest to wear soft, beautiful, and refreshing linen clothes this summer, have launched a labor competition. They were originally silk weaving workers, and the machines they use are all converted from silk weaving machines, which is inconvenient in operation. However, the workers came up with solutions and overcame the difficulties. In April, they had already woven a batch of linen cloth, which was soft and white after bleaching.
    In order to expand the production of linen yarn and linen cloth and further meet the needs of the people's livelihood, the expansion project of the spinning workshop plant was completed in mid-April, and new spinning machines are now being installed. It is estimated that the output of linen yarn in June will double the current output. (Attached photo)

    西南绢纺厂
    积极生产麻纱布
    西南绢纺厂织麻纱布的工人们，为了使西南人民在今年夏天穿上柔软、美观、爽身的麻纱衣服，开展了劳动竞赛。他们原来都是织绸缎的工人，所使用的机器又都是过去织绸缎的机器改装的，在操作上有许多不便。但工人们想出办法，克服了困难。四月份，他们已织出了一批麻纱布，经漂炼后，质地柔软洁白。
    该厂为了扩大麻纱和麻纱布的产量，进一步满足人民生活上的需要，纺麻车间厂房扩建工程已于四月中旬完成，现正安装新式纺机，预计六月份麻纱产量将比目前增加一倍。（附图片）
