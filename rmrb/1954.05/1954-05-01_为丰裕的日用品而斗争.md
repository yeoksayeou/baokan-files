    Struggle for Abundant Daily Necessities
    Ye. Tsvyetkova, Foreman of the Carding Workshop, Ivanovo Milanki Textile Factory, USSR

    I feel happy every day when I walk into the carding workshop of the Ivanovo Milanki Textile Factory. This is where I work. Since I was a teenager, I have worked in this largest textile factory in our country, which was established during the First Five-Year Plan. I grew up here, found my beloved job and happiness here. In 1939, I left the countryside and entered the apprentice school of the Milanki Textile Factory. At that time, I was a sixteen-year-old girl. After graduation, I worked as a second roving worker in the roving workshop for two years, then as a maintenance worker, and later as the deputy foreman of the carding department. Since 1948, I have been the foreman of the workshop. I successfully lead the work of the whole team, which has a total of fifty-eight carding workers, spool changers, oilers, grinding workers and maintenance workers, managing three hundred complex carding machines.

    How did I, an ordinary textile worker, become a leader and expert? First of all, it is due to the patient help of the old comrades and the constant support of the Party and Youth League organizations in the workshop. They encouraged and supported my desire to master production technology and improve my knowledge; they helped me complete the technical training class and the Stakhanovite work experience school, and graduated from the textile secondary technical night school attached to the Milanki Textile Factory. In the Soviet Union, every worker can receive secondary and even higher education without leaving production. In order to repay this great care, everyone is willing to work better in order to produce more daily necessities.

    The Ivanovo Milanki Textile Factory produces hundreds of thousands of meters of high-quality clothing fabrics every day. Our factory's production performance is very good, and the output of fabrics exceeds the plan every day. We improve labor productivity by taking good care of machines and being good at using them, by saving raw materials, fuel and electricity. At the same time, we are constantly reducing costs and producing more fabrics than planned. This year, all the staff of our factory participated in the socialist competition, and we guaranteed to produce 330,000 meters of fabrics more than planned for the country. What is said must be done; the promise of the Ivanovo textile workers is unwavering.

    In order to gloriously fulfill this promise, my team completes 105% of the production task every day, and constantly supplies cotton slivers to the roving workshop. In order to obtain better results, we are improving the production skills of all the workers in the team. My deputy foreman, Maria Anisimova, and I lead specialized technical seminars and Stakhanovite work experience schools, and we teach textile workers advanced labor methods and Stakhanovite work methods. The major tasks put forward by the Communist Party and the Soviet government to the textile industry sector require all our employees to have high labor skills.

    Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Soviet people quickly healed the serious wounds of the war, and raised the heavy industry, which is the foundation of our country's strength, to more than twice the pre-war level. Relying on this great power, the Soviet people are jubilantly realizing the resolutions of the Party and the government on fully developing the daily necessities industry and creating an abundance of various supplies for the working people in the country.

    We textile workers are proud that we are not in an insignificant position in this noble task. The Soviet government has given more care to the textile industry, and the textile industry is actually receiving the latest domestically produced equipment, not every day, but every hour.

    Taking the Ivanovo region, this ancient textile industry area, as an example, it has grown and changed beyond recognition in the Soviet era. The textile enterprises in this state produced 543 million meters more textiles in 1953 than in 1940 before the war. In the last four years alone, 1,659 machines and linkages, 771 spinning machines and 1,749 looms, including 570 automatic looms, have been installed in various production departments of textile enterprises. This year, 2,480 automatic looms, 747 spinning machines and other machines will be installed. More than 75% of the cotton selection and cleaning machines have been replaced.

    I think these figures are more convincing than the most eloquent words.

    There are also some other figures that clearly show our country's kind and fatherly care for textile workers. Before the establishment of the Soviet regime, Ivanovo was considered to be the Russian city with the worst municipal facilities, the least cultural and the most unsanitary. But in just the last few years, more than 200,000 square meters of workers' housing have been built in the city. Now Ivanovo has wide, green streets lined with multi-story palace-like residences, and its squares and parks are also beautiful. Ivanovo currently has sixty-one ordinary schools, twenty-one schools for young workers, six institutions of higher learning (with a total of 19,000 college students), 140 kindergartens and nurseries, seventeen clubs, fifty-four public libraries, three theaters, four cinemas and a circus. There are 900 doctors and 2,500 intermediate medical personnel working in medical institutions in this city.

    Our motherland never hesitates to use its strength and funds in order to make the people of the Soviet country live a happy and joyful life. The textile experts in Ivanovo deeply realize this and are fighting with redoubled efforts to produce abundant daily necessities.

    In 1953, all the employees of textile enterprises in Ivanovo region over-fulfilled the plan and produced 27,000,600 meters more textiles for the country. The textiles produced by using saved raw materials exceeded the socialist competition task by 17 million meters. This year's fabric production will increase by more than 70 million meters. In the great cause of communist construction that the Soviet people are victoriously realizing, let us make this our modest contribution.

    为丰裕的日用品而斗争
    苏联伊凡诺佛米兰基纺织工厂梳棉车间领班　耶·茨维特科娃
    每天当我走进伊凡诺佛米兰基纺织工厂的梳棉车间时，我都怀着愉快的心情。这里是我工作的地方。从少年的时候起，我就在这所第一个五年计划期间建立起来的我国规模最大的纺织工厂里工作。我在这里长大，在这里找到了自己所爱好的工作和幸福。一九三九年，我离开农村进入米兰基纺织工厂的艺徒学校学习，当时我还是一个十六岁的女孩子。毕业后，我在粗纱车间当了两年的二道粗纱女工，以后又当保全女工，后来任梳棉部门的副领班。从一九四八年起，当了车间的领班。我顺利地领导着全班的工作，我们班里共有五十八个梳棉女工、换筒女工、上油工、车磨工和保全工，管理着三百台复杂的梳棉机器。
    我是怎样从一个普通的纺织女工变成了领导者和专家的呢？这首先是由于老同志们耐心的帮助以及车间党和青年团组织的经常支持。他们鼓励和支持我掌握生产技术和提高知识的热望；他们帮助我完成了技术训练班和斯达哈诺夫式工作经验学校的学习，并在米兰基纺织工厂附设的纺织中等技术专科夜校毕了业。在苏维埃国家中，每一个工人都可以不脱离生产地受到中等甚至高等教育。为了回答这种伟大的关怀，每个人都愿意更好地劳动，以便生产更多的日用品。
    伊凡诺佛米兰基纺织工厂每天生产数十万公尺的上等衣料织品。我们工厂的生产成绩很好，织品的产量逐日都超过计划。我们由于十分爱护机器和善于使用机器，由于节约原料、燃料和电力而提高着劳动生产率，同时，我们不断降低成本，并超计划地生产着更多的织品。今年，我们工厂的全体人员参加了社会主义竞赛，我们保证超计划地为国家多生产三十三万公尺织品。说了就要做到；伊凡诺佛纺织工人的诺言是坚定不移的。
    为了要光荣地实现这个诺言，我这一班每天都完成百分之一百零五的生产任务，不断地为粗纱车间供应棉条。为了获得更好的成绩，我们正在提高全班工人的生产技能。我和副领班马丽亚·安尼西莫娃领导着专门技术讲习班和斯达哈诺夫式工作经验学校，我们把先进的劳动方法和斯达哈诺夫式工作法教给纺织工人们。共产党和苏联政府给纺织工业部门提出的重大任务，要求我们全体员工有高度的劳动技巧。
    在党和政府的领导下，苏联人民迅速地医治好了战争的严重创伤，把作为我国的威力的基础的重工业提高到战前水平的两倍以上。依靠这一巨大力量，苏联人民正欢欣鼓舞地实现党和政府关于全力发展日用品工业和在国内为劳动人民创造丰裕的各种用品的决议。
    我们纺织工人引以自豪的是：在这一崇高的任务中，我们并不是处于无足轻重的地位。苏联政府对纺织工业已更加关怀，纺织工业，实际上已经不是在每一天内，而是在每一小时内都在获得最新式的本国制造的装备。
    以伊凡诺佛州，这个古老的纺织工业区来说，它在苏维埃政权年代里已经成长和改变得无法辨认了。这个州的各纺织企业一九五三年的纺织品生产量比战前一九四○年增加了五亿四千三百万公尺。仅在最近四年内，在纺织企业的各个生产部门内就安装了一千六百五十九台机器和联动机，七百七十一台纺纱机和一千七百四十九台织布机，其中包括五百七十台自动织布机。今年还要安装二千四百八十台自动织布机，七百四十七台纺纱机和其他机器。百分之七十五以上的选棉和清花机都已重新更换了。
    我认为这些数字比最雄辩的话语都更具有说服力。
    另外还有一些数字，它们清楚地说明了我们国家对纺织工人的亲切的、父亲般的关怀。在苏维埃政权建立以前，伊凡诺佛被认为是一个市政设备最坏、最没有文化和最不讲卫生的俄国城市。但仅仅在最近数年内，市内就建筑了二十多万平方公尺的工人住宅。现在伊凡诺佛有宽阔的绿化了的街道，两旁散布着多层的宫殿般的住宅，它的广场和公园也是美丽的。伊凡诺佛市目前有六十一所普通学校，二十一所青年工人学校，六所高等学校（共有一万九千名大学生），一百四十所幼儿园和托儿所，十七个俱乐部，五十四个大众图书馆，三个剧院，四个电影院和一个杂技团。在这个城内医疗机关工作的有九百名医生，二千五百名中级医务人员。
    为了使苏维埃国家的人民过愉快幸福的生活，我们祖国从不吝惜自己的力量和资金。伊凡诺佛的纺织能手们深刻地认识到这点，正以加倍的劳动来为生产丰裕的日用品而斗争。
   一九五三年伊凡诺佛州各纺织企业的全体员工超计划地为国家多生产了二千七百万零六百公尺的纺织品。利用节省的原料生产的纺织品超出社会主义竞赛任务一千七百万公尺。今年的织品生产量将增加七千多万公尺。在苏联人民胜利实现的共产主义建设的伟大事业中，让我们把这作为自己的一点微薄的贡献吧。
