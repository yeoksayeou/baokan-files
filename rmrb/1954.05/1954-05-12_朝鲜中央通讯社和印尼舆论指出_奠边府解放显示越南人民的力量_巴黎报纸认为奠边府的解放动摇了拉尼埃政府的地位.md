Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th. The Korean Central News Agency commented on the liberation of Dien Bien Phu on the 10th, saying: The Vietnamese People's Army has liberated Dien Bien Phu, the fortress that the French invaders boasted was "unconquerable." All righteous people in the world are excited about this great victory achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle for freedom and national independence.

The commentary said that the liberation of Dien Bien Phu caused the French and American imperialists to lose their last stronghold in northwestern Vietnam. It signifies the failure of the notorious "Navarre Plan," which attempted to use this area as a springboard to expand aggression.

The commentary pointed out that the liberation of Dien Bien Phu caused confusion among the invaders. The panic and anxiety in Paris and Washington over this event are not difficult to imagine.

The commentary also pointed out that the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in Dien Bien Phu will be forever recorded in the history of the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle; it shows the invincible strength of the Vietnamese people in defending national independence and freedom and resisting colonial rule.

The commentary concluded that all peace-loving people in the world are fervently hoping that the Geneva Conference can restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the national independence and freedom of the Vietnamese, Khmer, and Lao peoples.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 11th. Indonesian public opinion attaches great importance to the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in liberating Dien Bien Phu.

The "Indonesia Raya" newspaper commented that the liberation of Dien Bien Phu proves that the Asian people "are able to end the history of colonialists attempting to realize their greedy desires by armed force." The commentary said that the French claim that the People's Republic of China is supporting the Vietnamese people "is actually just an excuse for France to seek help from the United States and its allies." The commentary pointed out that it is well known that the United States bears 80 percent of the cost of France's colonial war in Vietnam; in addition, the United States also supplies many planes and pilots.

The "Great Indonesia" newspaper said that American dollars, military aid, and airlift could not save the French army in Dien Bien Phu, which will make France realize that continuing the colonial war in Indochina would be tantamount to "suicide." The newspaper expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference can smoothly resolve the Indochina issue and achieve peace.

The "Eastern Star" editorial said that the victory of the Vietnamese people in Dien Bien Phu "not only shocked France, but also its allies, especially the United States." The newspaper also believes that France's proposal at the Geneva Conference to "disarm personnel who do not belong to the army or maintain security forces" is unacceptable to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam because: "We know that the armed forces of the Viet Minh (referring to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) are the entire people, and they are willing to participate in the struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th. TASS reported from Paris on the 10th: Newspapers stated in various ways that the loss of the Dien Bien Phu fortress has seriously shaken the position of the Laniel government. Because parliamentarians, especially Delonay of the Republican Union for Social Action, submitted questions to the Secretariat of the National Assembly, newspapers are predicting that the National Assembly will inevitably debate the Indochina issue.

"Combat" wrote that "the loss of Dien Bien Phu has seriously shaken the already shaky position of the Laniel government," and "new questions will create a government crisis in the National Assembly tomorrow." The newspaper believes that the hostility of the Republican Union for Social Action parliamentary group and many Radical Socialist Party members towards the government has recently intensified.

According to the newspaper's view, there are only two paths in front of the French ruling group: either continue the costly and wasteful war, or conduct peace negotiations. From this point of view, once a government crisis occurs, there can only be two decisions: "either the decision of the government majority faction that supports the internationalization of the Indochina War, or the decision of the majority faction that supports peace." The statement of General Navarre, commander-in-chief of the French army in Indochina, typically illustrates the mood of some figures in the French ruling group. In his speech at a press conference in Saigon, Navarre admitted that his notorious "offensive plan" did not fully recognize the strength of "the enemy." He said that if he had known "the true strength of the Viet Minh," then he "might not have defended Dien Bien Phu." Navarre pointed out that the Indochina War has since undergone a "completely new transformation," and that failure of the Geneva Conference will inevitably "internationalize this war."

"Combat" wrote, referring to Navarre's statement:
"This French general openly said what Paris was whispering about."

    朝鲜中央通讯社和印尼舆论指出
    奠边府解放显示越南人民的力量
    巴黎报纸认为奠边府的解放动摇了拉尼埃政府的地位
    【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜中央通讯社十日评论奠边府的解放说：越南人民军解放了法国侵略者所吹嘘为“攻不克”的堡垒——奠边府。全世界一切正义人士都为越南人民在争取自由和民族独立的斗争中所取得的这个伟大的胜利而兴奋。
    评论说，奠边府的解放，使法、美帝国主义者丧失了在越南西北地区的最后据点。它意味着企图把这个地区作为跳板来扩大侵略的臭名远扬的“纳瓦尔计划”的失败。
    评论指出，奠边府的解放引起了侵略者的混乱。巴黎和华盛顿对这个事件的惊慌和焦急是不难想像的。
    评论又指出，越南人民军在奠边府的胜利将被永远记录在越南人民的民族解放斗争史上；它显示了越南人民在保卫民族独立和自由、反抗殖民统治的斗争中的不可战胜的力量。
    评论最后说，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都在热烈地希望日内瓦会议能在尊重越南、高棉和寮国人民的民族独立和自由的基础上，恢复印度支那的和平。
    【新华社雅加达十一日电】印尼舆论对越南人民军解放奠边府的胜利非常重视。
      “印尼新闻报”的评论说：奠边府的解放，证明亚洲人民“能够结束殖民主义者企图以武装力量实现他们的贪婪欲望的历史”。评论说：法国所说的中华人民共和国正在支援越南人民这一点，“实际上只是法国求助于美国和它的盟国”的借口。评论指出：人们都知道，美国负担了法国在越南进行殖民战争的费用的百分之八十；此外，美国还供应许多飞机和飞行员。
      “大印度尼西亚报”说，美国人的美元、军事援助和空运都救不了奠边府法军，这将使法国认识到继续在印度支那进行殖民战争将等于“自杀”。该报表示希望日内瓦会议能顺利地解决印度支那问题，并实现和平。
    “东星报”的社论说：越南人民在奠边府的胜利“不只使法国震惊，也使它的盟国特别是美国震惊”。该报并认为：法国在日内瓦会议建议“解除既不属于军队、也不属于维持治安的部队的人员的武装”，是越南民主共和国所不能接受的，因为：“我们知道，越盟（指越南民主共和国）的武装力量是全体人民，他们愿意参加斗争。”
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：各报以各种不同的方式说明，奠边府要塞的失守严重地动摇了拉尼埃政府的地位。由于议员们，特别是社会行动共和联盟的议员德隆纳向国民议会秘书处提出质问，各报都预测国民议会已免不了要对印度支那问题进行辩论。
    “战斗报”写道，“奠边府的失守严重地动摇了本来就已摇摇欲坠的拉尼埃政府的地位”，而“新的质问将于明天在国民议会中造成政府危机”。该报认为，最近社会行动共和联盟议会党团和许多激进社会党议员对政府的敌意已经加强了。
    据该报的看法，现在法国统治集团的面前只有两条路：或是继续进行劳民伤财的战争，或是进行和平谈判。由此看来，一旦发生政府危机，只能有两种决定：“或者是赞成印度支那战争国际化的政府多数派的决定，或者是赞成和平的多数派的决定”。印度支那法军总司令纳瓦尔将军的声明典型地说明了法国统治集团一些人物的心情。纳瓦尔在西贡的记者招待会上的讲话中就承认，他的臭名昭彰的“进攻计划”中没有充分认识到“敌人”的力量。他说，如果他知道“越盟的真正力量”，那末他“也许不会去守奠边府”。纳瓦尔指出，印度支那战争从此有了“完全新的转变”，一旦日内瓦会议失败必将“使这一战争国际化”。
      “战斗报”在提到纳瓦尔的这项声明时写道：
  “这位法国将军公开说出了巴黎方面窃窃私语着的事情。”
