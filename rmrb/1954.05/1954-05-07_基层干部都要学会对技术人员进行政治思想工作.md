    In the country's planned economic construction, the Party requires technical personnel to study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union more conscientiously and to integrate more closely with workers, so as to give full play to their technical guidance role in production and construction. After several years of education by the Party, the majority of technical personnel are willing to learn from the Soviet Union and integrate with the workers. However, it must also be seen that learning from the Soviet Union and integrating with workers is also an arduous ideological struggle for technical personnel. They must constantly fight against erroneous views such as technical conservatism, detachment from reality, and belittling labor, as well as irresponsible and subjective work styles. This requires the Party organization to provide them with more frequent and specific assistance and education. In particular, grassroots Party cadres need to provide frequent and specific assistance and education. Most of the problems encountered by technical personnel in learning from the Soviet Union, especially in integrating with workers, are manifested in the production site. Grassroots Party cadres are often the first to encounter these problems. At the same time, most grassroots cadres maintain close ties with the masses of workers and understand the workers' demands and opinions on technical personnel. Grassroots Party cadres can play a greater role in solving the problems encountered in the integration of technical personnel and workers.

    It is difficult for grassroots Party cadres to do political and ideological work on technical personnel. The difficulties come from two aspects:

    First, many technical personnel look down on grassroots Party cadres. They believe that grassroots cadres have low cultural and theoretical levels and do not understand technical theories, so it is difficult for them to be helpful. Therefore, they are unwilling to actively seek help from grassroots cadres when problems arise, but instead directly seek help from factory directors and Party committee secretaries. This idea and practice are wrong. Technical personnel should realize that although grassroots Party cadres do not have high cultural and theoretical levels, and especially lack technical theoretical knowledge, most of these comrades have been promoted from among the workers, or are veteran cadres who have been tested by the revolution. They have close ties with the masses, have a very clear and firm view of serving the people, and have rich operational experience and practical work experience. These are precisely what technical personnel lack. Isn't the fact very obvious? Although Ma Xingwang was a branch secretary from an ordinary worker background, he knew how to deal with mistakes. However, the technician of No. 1 blast furnace did not understand this. Only after he received Ma Xingwang's help and boldly admitted his mistake did he improve his relationship with the workers and improve his production work. Therefore, technical personnel must change their view of looking down on grassroots Party cadres, and at the same time actively seek their help, in order to improve themselves faster.

    The other difficulty is that grassroots Party cadres still have wrong perceptions of technical personnel. Although the Party has long clearly pointed out that technical personnel are part of the working class and should be united to do a good job in production, many grassroots Party cadres are not good at distinguishing between the family background and ideological style shortcomings of technical personnel and their own class composition. They only see that most technical personnel come from landlord or bourgeois families, only see that they are still infected with more bourgeois ideological styles, and do not see that they are mental workers, do not see that they have made great progress in the years since liberation, and generally believe that technical personnel are "backward" and "unreliable." Some people even emphasize the differences in living habits and are unwilling to approach technical personnel. The reason why these wrong perceptions have not been resolved for a long time is that, on the one hand, the theoretical and ideological level of grassroots Party cadres is not high enough, and they lack the ability to specifically analyze things. On the other hand, the antagonistic emotions between workers and technical personnel in the old society have not completely changed, so they always "do not fit in" with technical personnel. This requires the Party committees of factories and mines to constantly help grassroots cadres to criticize these erroneous ideas. The Party committee should not only clearly explain to grassroots cadres why technical personnel are part of the working class and the important role of technical personnel in national construction, but also specifically analyze and criticize some of their erroneous perceptions. Otherwise, they will verbally acknowledge that technical personnel are the working class, but in reality treat them as the bourgeoisie without uniting and educating them.

    The Party committee must also dispel the idea that grassroots cadres are afraid of doing political and ideological work on technical personnel. Grassroots cadres are often afraid to do political and ideological work on technical personnel because of their low cultural and theoretical level. In fact, it can be clearly seen from Ma Xingwang's work process that what technical personnel require from the Party organization, especially grassroots Party cadres, is not lecturing on theory or culture, but solving the problems of how to treat technology, how to treat work, and how to treat workers. Naturally, discovering and analyzing these problems often requires going through complex technical issues, and it is difficult to do so without understanding technology. However, as long as you are good at relying on activists among technical personnel and skilled veteran technical workers, this difficulty can be overcome to a certain extent. The Party committee should increase their confidence, so that they dare to move forward, and then help them to continuously improve their theoretical level and learn technical and business knowledge, so as to constantly overcome the difficulties in their work.

    基层干部都要学会对技术人员进行政治思想工作
    正怀
    在国家的有计划经济建设中，党要求技术人员更加认真地学习苏联的先进科学技术，更密切地和工人结合起来，以便充分发挥对生产和建设的技术指导作用。经过党的几年的教育，大多数技术人员是愿意学习苏联，愿意和工人结合的。但是，也必须看到，学习苏联和与工人结合，对于技术人员来说，也是一个艰苦的思想斗争过程，必须时时刻刻向技术上的保守思想、脱离实际、轻视劳动等错误观点以及工作中的不负责任和主观主义的作风进行斗争。这就需要党组织更加经常地对他们进行具体的帮助和教育。特别需要党的基层干部经常具体的帮助和教育。技术人员在学习苏联特别是和工人结合中发生的问题大多表现在生产现场中。党的基层干部常常首先接触到这方面的问题。同时，大多数的基层干部同工人群众保持有密切的联系，懂得工人对技术人员的要求和意见，在解决技术人员和工人结合中所遇到的问题时，党的基层干部能够发挥更大的作用。
    党的基层干部对技术人员做政治思想工作是有困难的。困难来自两方面：
    首先，不少技术人员轻视党的基层干部。他们认为基层干部文化和理论水平低，不懂技术理论，很难对自己有所帮助，因而，有了问题都不肯主动地去找基层干部，而是直接找厂长和党委书记帮助解决。这种想法和做法是不对的。技术人员们应该认识到，党的基层干部虽然文化和理论水平都不够高，特别缺少技术理论知识，但是，这些同志大多是从工人中提拔出来的，或者是久经革命考验的老干部。他们和群众有密切联系，为人民服务的观点十分明确和坚定，有丰富的操作经验和实际工作经验。而这些，恰恰是技术人员所缺乏的。事实不是很明显吗？马兴旺虽然是一个普通工人出身的支部书记，但是他懂得应该怎样对待错误；而一高炉的技术员却不懂得这一点，只有当他得到了马兴旺的帮助，大胆地承认了自己的错误后，才搞好了和工人的关系，改进了生产工作。所以，技术人员必须改变轻视党的基层干部的看法，同时主动地取得他们的帮助，才能够更快地提高自己。
    困难的另一方面是党的基层干部对技术人员还有着错误的认识。虽然，党早已明确地指出技术人员是工人阶级中的一部分，应该团结他们搞好生产。但是，还有许多党的基层干部不善于把技术人员的家庭出身以及思想作风上的缺点和本人的阶级成分区别开来。只看到技术人员大多出身于地主或资产阶级家庭，只看到他们还沾染有较多的资产阶级的思想作风，而看不到他们是脑力劳动者，看不到他们解放后几年来有了很大的进步，笼统地认为技术人员“落后”、“不可靠”。有些人甚至强调生活习惯的不同，不愿接近技术人员。这些错误认识所以长期不能解决，一方面是因为党的基层干部理论和思想水平还不够高，缺少具体分析事物的能力，一方面也还因为旧社会中工人和技术人员的对立情绪还没有完全改变，因此总和技术人员“格格不入”。这就要求工矿党委经常地帮助基层干部来批判这些错误思想。党委不仅要向基层干部讲清楚为什么技术人员是工人阶级的一部分，以及技术人员在国家建设中的重大作用，同时还必须具体分析和批判他们的一些错误认识，否则，他们就会口头上承认技术人员是工人阶级，实际上把他们当资产阶级看待而不去团结教育他们。
    党委还必须打破基层干部怕对技术人员进行政治思想工作的想法。基层干部常常因为自己的文化和理论水平不高，因而不敢去对技术人员进行政治思想工作。实际上，从马兴旺的工作过程中可以很清楚地看到，技术人员所要求于党组织特别是党的基层干部的，并不是讲理论、讲文化、而是解决如何对待技术、如何对待工作、如何对待工人的问题。自然发现和分析这些问题，常常得透过复杂的技术问题，不懂技术是有困难的。但是，只要善于依靠技术人员中的积极分子以及熟练的老技术工人，这个困难在一定程度上是可以克服的。党委应该提高他们的信心，使他们敢于举步前进，然后，再帮助他们努力提高理论水平、学习技术业务知识，以便不断克服工作中的困难。
