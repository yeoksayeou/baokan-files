    Rural Communist Party Members Faced with New Tasks
    Ge·Bakhmov, Secretary of the Bilozerka District Committee, Kherson Oblast, Ukraine

    The Bilozerka District is located in southern Ukraine, between the Dnieper and Southern Bug rivers. Fertile soil, a warm climate, a high degree of technical equipment, and the adoption of advanced agronomic methods—all of these enable our collective farms and state farms to expand the harvest of various crops, increase livestock production, and smoothly develop various public undertakings year by year.

    The historic resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union set out a grand program for further greatly increasing socialist agriculture. In order to ensure that residents can obtain abundant food and guarantee the necessary raw materials for the food and light industries, it is necessary to expand the production of grain, vegetables, meat, milk, and other products. The Communist Party members in the countryside are mobilizing collective farmers, machine tractor station, and state farm workers to form an army of tens of millions to complete these tasks.

    The success of the cause depends on people, depends on cadres. After the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party Oblast Committee carried out the work of cadre allocation and cadre education more deeply. A large number of politically mature Communist Party members with the necessary agricultural knowledge were sent from the district center to work in collective farms. In the previously more backward collective farms, comrades Hartoha, Makogonchuk, Gorbalenko, Shaniko, and others, who are Communist Party members, were elected to serve as chairmen and vice-chairmen. Communist Party members Kudryavchenko, Klyantov, Ponomarenko, and Sudarik lead livestock farms. Thirty-four skilled agronomists and livestock experts dispatched to the farms have become the organizers and leaders of all production processes. Special attention has been given to the consolidation of machine tractor stations, because machine tractor stations are the foundation of industrial production in the countryside. The Bilozerka, Kiselevsky, and Stanislavsky machine tractor stations have all been supplemented with agricultural experts and engineering technicians. Comrades Tolochinoi and Luchenko, who previously worked in the Party District Committee organs, were elected as secretaries of the Party branches of the machine tractor stations. Party work personnel groups led by the District Committee secretaries were established in the machine tractor stations. In order to help Party activists master agricultural knowledge, the Standing Committee of the District Committee holds seminars every month, gives speeches on agricultural technology issues, and discusses Party work and the completion of current agricultural tasks.

    Strengthening cadre work has achieved good results, enhanced the organizational and educational role of the district's thirty-two rural Party organizations, and increased their fighting power. This can be illustrated by the increased labor enthusiasm of grain growers, vegetable growers, livestock breeders, and machine operators. A vigorous competition to tap and fully utilize the production potential of collective farms and state farms has been launched in the countryside.

    Based on the proposals of many Party organizations, two-year plans for the comprehensive development of agriculture have been formulated in the collective farms. The plans clearly stipulate the specific measures and tasks for each work team and each collective farm to strive to increase the harvest of various crops and the output of livestock products. For example, if the Budyonny collective farm implements these measures, it can obtain more than six million rubles of income in 1955, and can extensively expand the construction of collective farm public facilities, cultural facilities, and housing, and can electrify and fully mechanize livestock farms. Grain, especially winter wheat, is the most important crop in our district's agriculture. Thanks to the application of advanced agricultural technology, it is common for collective farms to harvest 120 poods of wheat per hectare. The total grain harvest is constantly increasing. This year, we plan to hand over more than 1.5 million poods of grain to the state. In order to expand grain production, it is planned to cultivate another 900 hectares of land, which can yield about 100,000 more poods of grain. The foundation for a bumper harvest in the future has been laid in the spring. The district sowed early-maturing grains at the highest level in three workdays. Topdressing has been applied to autumn crops, autumn fallow land is being rectified, and urgent measures are being taken in agricultural technology.

    Vegetable growing accounts for a considerable proportion of the district's agriculture. The collective farms and state farms that grow various vegetables are the raw material suppliers for the country's largest Kherson Stalin Cannery. In the past year alone, 8,675 tons of vegetables were sold to the state. The Party organization called on collective farmers to expand vegetable planting so that the total vegetable output and sales volume can be doubled this year. 17,000 hotbed frames have been built in collective farms and state farms, more than one million peat humus containers have been prepared, and vegetable gardens are being universally fertilized. Most of the vegetables will be planted on irrigated land to ensure a bumper harvest.

    The task of cotton planting is also very important. This year, we will expand cotton planting here. Advanced cotton planting teams have proposed to harvest 10 to 12 quintals of cotton per hectare. On average, the district can also harvest no less than 7 quintals of this valuable technical crop per hectare. There is no doubt that we will complete these glorious tasks well, because the Party organization has cultivated many cotton planting experts. Two hundred and forty collective farmers have been rewarded by the government for consistently obtaining high yields in cotton planting in recent years. Yevtokiya Spak, a female member of the collective farm, was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

    In our district, the prospects for continuously expanding the production of grain, vegetables, cotton, melons, and other crops are extremely bright. According to the decision of the Soviet government, all personnel of the "Ukraine Water Conservancy Construction Bureau" are carrying out the construction of a huge irrigation system in the Mingurets lowlands. The water diverted by this irrigation system can irrigate more than 10,000 hectares of arid land in our district. The first part of the irrigation network will begin to divert water early next year. Our task is to use various most effective methods to use irrigation to increase the harvest of various crops.

    The party members in the countryside have initially improved public product livestock industry. They pay great attention to the breeding of livestock. Advanced and rational feeding methods have been adopted in the livestock farms. In all collective farms, feed has been processed and boiled. Two months ago, the cattle farm adopted a new and advanced work system. All these situations are enough to illustrate the development of our livestock industry. This year, the milk yield per cow has increased compared to last year, reaching 186 kilograms. The plan to increase the total number of various livestock is about to be completed. Collective farms already have 16 cattle, 16 pigs, and 24 sheep per 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and subsidiary land. However, the potential and various possibilities for improving the livestock industry have not yet been fully utilized. The Party organization and all workers in the district have much work to do in this regard.

    The struggle for further improving socialist agriculture is a truly nationwide cause. Every day, many first-class machines, improved tools, equipment, and various materials are transported here from all corners of the country. Enterprises and construction bureaus in the cities have given great assistance to collective farms and machine tractor stations. Many highly skilled cadres have come from the cities to work in machine tractor stations.

    The selfless labor of collective farmers, machine tractor station and state farm workers under the leadership of the Party organization, as well as the help of the whole people, is the foundation for achieving new achievements in all economic sectors. Communist Party members in the countryside are doing their best to enable the workers of the Bilozerka District to win in the competition with the collective farmers of the Batumi District of Georgia for completing the historic resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    农村共产党员在新任务面前
    乌克兰赫尔松州别洛捷尔斯克区党委书记　格·巴赫莫夫
    别洛捷尔斯克区位于乌克兰南部第聂伯河和南布加河之间。肥沃的土壤，温暖的气候，高度的技术设备、先进农艺方法的采用——所有这些使我们的集体农庄和国营农场能逐年扩大各种作物的收成，提高畜牧业的产量，顺利地发展各种公共事业。
    苏共中央委员会历史性的决议，订出了进一步大力提高社会主义农业的宏伟纲领，为了使居民能得到丰裕的食品和保证食品工业及轻工业有必需的原料，就要扩大谷物、蔬菜、肉类、乳类以及其它产品的生产。农村中的共产党员正动员集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，使他们结成一支数千万人的大军来完成这些任务。
    事业的成就决定于人，决定于干部。苏共中央一九五三年九月全会以后，党州委会更深入地进行了干部配备和干部教育工作。大批政治上成熟而又具有必要的农业知识的共产党员从区中心被派到集体农庄工作。在以前比较落后的集体农庄里，选出了共产党员哈尔托哈依、马科冈楚克、郭尔巴金科、沙尼科等同志担任主席和副主席。共产党员库德梁甫琴科、克良托夫、波诺马连科、苏德里克同志领导饲畜场。派到农庄去的三十四位熟练的农学家和饲畜专家，已经成了一切生产过程的组织者和领导者。机器拖拉机站的巩固工作受到特殊的关怀，因为机器拖拉机站是工业生产在农村中的基础。别洛捷尔斯基、基谢列夫斯基和斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基机器拖拉机站都补充了农业专家和工程技术人员。前此在党区委会机关中工作的托洛奇诺依和鲁琴科同志被选为机器拖拉机站的党支部书记。在机器拖拉机站建立了区委书记领导的党的工作人员小组。为了帮助党的积极分子掌握农业知识，区委会常委会每月举办讲习班，做有关农业技术问题的演说，讨论党的工作和当前农业任务的完成情况。
    加强干部工作已经取得了良好的效果，提高了本区三十二个农村党组织的组织作用和教育作用，提高了它们的战斗力。谷物种植者、蔬菜种植者、牲畜饲养者和机器操使者的劳动积极性的提高就可以说明这一点。在农村中大力开展了挖掘和充分利用集体农庄、国营农场生产潜力的竞赛。
    根据许多党组织的提议，在集体农庄中制订了全面发展农业的两年计划。计划中明确规定了每个工作队、每个集体农庄为提高各种作物的收成和畜产品产量而斗争的具体措施和任务。例如布琼尼集体农庄如果实现了这些措施，那么它在一九五五年便可以得到六百多万卢布的收入，可以广泛扩大集体农庄公用设备、文化生活设施和住房的建设，可以使饲畜场实现电气化和全部机械化。谷物，特别是冬麦，是我们这区农业中最主要的作物。由于运用了先进的农业技术，每公顷土地收获一百二十普特小麦的事在集体农庄是很平常的。谷物的总收获量在不断增加。今年我们计划缴纳给国家一百五十多万普特谷物。为了扩大谷物生产，预定再耕种九百公顷土地，还可以多收十万普特左右的谷物。在春季就给未来的丰收打下了基础。全区以最高水平用三个劳动日播种了早熟谷物。对秋季作物，施了一次追肥，正在整顿秋耕休闲地，在农业技术上采取了紧急的措施。
    种菜业在本区农业中占有不小的比重。种植各种蔬菜的集体农庄和国营农场，是本国最大的赫尔松斯大林罐头工厂的原料供应者。仅在去年一年，就售给国家八千六百七十五吨蔬菜。党组织号召集体农民扩大蔬菜的种植，使今年蔬菜总产量和销售量能增加一倍。在集体农庄和国营农场里已经造了一万七千个温床架，准备了一百多万个泥炭腐植容器，菜园正在普遍施肥。大部分蔬菜都要种到水浇地上，以保证蔬菜能得到丰收。
    植棉方面的任务也是很大的。今年我们这里要扩大棉花的种植。先进的植棉小组提出要使一公顷土地收获十到十二公担棉花。全区平均计算，每公顷土地也可以收到这种贵重技术作物不少于七公担。毫无疑问，我们是会很好地完成这些光荣任务的，因为党组织培养了很多植棉能手。有二百四十个集体农民近几年来在植棉方面一直得到了很高的收成，因而受到政府的奖赏。集体农庄女庄员耶夫托基雅·斯巴克荣获了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
    在我们区里，不断扩大谷物、蔬菜、棉花、瓜类及其它作物的生产，其前景是极其美好的。根据苏联政府的决定，“乌克兰水利建筑工程处”全体人员正在明古列茨低地进行巨大灌溉系统的建设。这个灌溉系统的引水能使我们这区一万多公顷的干旱土地得到灌溉。明年初，灌溉网的第一部分将开始引水。我们的任务就是以各种最有效的方法利用灌溉来提高各种作物的收获量。
    农村中的党员，已经初步提高了公共产品饲畜业。他们对牲畜的饲养给予了极大的注意。在饲畜场中采用了先进的合理的饲养方法。在所有的集体农庄中都对饲料进行了加工和煮沸。两个月以前，养牛场采取了新的先进的工作制度。所有这些情况都足以说明我们的饲畜业的发展。今年每头牛的挤乳量较去年有增加，达到一百八十六公斤。增加各种牲畜的总头数的计划即将完成。在每一百公顷耕地、草地、附属地上，集体农庄已有牛十六头、猪十六头、羊二十四头。但是，提高饲畜业的潜力和各种可能还远远没有充分利用。党组织和本区全体劳动者在这方面是有许多工作可做的。
      为进一步提高社会主义农业而斗争，是真正全民的事业。每天从国家各个角落运到这里许多头等机器，改善了的工具、装备和各种器材。城市中的企业和建设局对集体农庄和机器拖拉机站给予了极大的帮助。许多技术精湛的干部从城市里来到机器拖拉机站工作。
      在党组织领导下的集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作人员的忘我劳动，以及全民的帮助，乃是在一切经济部门中获得新成就的基础。农村中的共产党员正竭尽全力，使别洛捷尔斯克区的劳动者在为完成苏共中央历史性决议而同格鲁吉亚巴土姆区集体农民开展的竞赛运动中获得胜利。
