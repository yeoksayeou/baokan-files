    Circuit Court of the Wangjiang County People's Court, Anhui Province
    Judicial Administration Division of the East China Branch of the Supreme People's Court
    I.
    Wangjiang County, Anhui Province, has eight districts and two towns, with a population of approximately 270,000. In order to serve production and central work more effectively, and to facilitate litigation for the people, the Wangjiang County People's Court established three circuit courts successively from August to October 1953. Each court has jurisdiction over two or three districts; each court is staffed with two to three cadres, with the stronger cadre designated as the team leader to lead and be responsible for the court's work. The courts have established various work systems, such as regular trials, regular meetings, juror participation, and study. It is determined that trials will be held three times a month on fixed dates in the lunar calendar. The working methods are: mediation for cases of different natures separately, and centralized mediation for the same type of cases; trials at designated stations for parties from different regions, and on-the-spot trials for parties from the same region, or for complex cases involving a wide range of issues, such as mountain forests and water conservancy disputes; general civil and minor criminal cases are mediated by mediation organizations or grassroots cadres, and if mediation fails, the court will hear and adjudicate. When hearing cases, relevant departments are invited to send personnel to serve as jurors and the public to attend the hearing in order to clarify the facts and expand legal education. Major cases also solicit the opinions of local Party and government leaders and cooperate with relevant departments in handling them.
    II.
    The three circuit courts in the county have enhanced their prestige, gained the support of the Party and government, and the support of the masses in their practical work, achieving good results.
    1.  Guaranteeing and promoting the smooth progress of agricultural production and rural central work. The courts conduct judicial activities centered on production and local central work. For any case that hinders the smooth progress of production and central work, the courts can actively and promptly handle it. Within five months after the establishment of the three circuit courts, they have handled 17 mass mountain forest and water conservancy disputes, which promoted unity among farmers and guaranteed and promoted agricultural production. For example, the mountain forest dispute involving more than 140 households in the Liu, Xie, and Sheng families in Fenghuang Township, Liangquan District, had not been resolved for many years, which seriously affected the unity and production of farmers. After learning about this situation, the First Circuit Court took the initiative to cooperate with district and township cadres to convene representatives from both sides for mediation, and finally reached an agreement and concluded a covenant for the joint management and benefit of the mountain forest, which restored good relations among the three families. In this unified purchase and sale of grain, under the unified leadership of the county, the circuit courts closely cooperated with public security, civil affairs, procuratorate and other departments, grasped the social dynamics of the districts and townships where they were located, and through trials, cracked down on a small number of unscrupulous merchants and educated general merchants, thus guaranteeing and promoting the central work. For example, the unscrupulous merchant Xu Shuhua openly resisted the government in the unified purchase and sale. After reporting to the leading organs for examination and approval, the Second Circuit Court arrested him and publicly tried him. All the private merchants present received a profound legal education.
    2.  Through judicial activities, carry out legal education to prevent disputes and crimes. The circuit courts in the county use methods such as handling typical cases, public trials, circuit hearings, and posting large-character verdicts to conduct extensive and in-depth legal education among the masses. For example, gambling was rampant in the county after the autumn harvest in 1953, which not only caused a waste of manpower and financial resources, but also affected production and social order. Wang Jinrong of Mingnan Township, Changling District, stole cattle from the masses because he lost money gambling, and Yu Qingyun of Huahua Township sold his land because he lost money gambling, causing discord between husband and wife. In response to this situation, the First Circuit Court sentenced Yun Shikai, a gambling criminal who had served as a military police officer under Chiang Kai-shek, to imprisonment; and printed and distributed hundreds of copies of the verdict, distributing them throughout the county for posting, helping district and township cadres to promptly quell the gambling wind and stabilize social order. Another example is the case of five divorced women in Jiang'ou Village, Laolin Township, Xinba District, who were not allowed by their former husbands to take away the property they were entitled to. After unsuccessful mediation by the district and township for a long time, the First Circuit Court selected the case of Jiang Peigen and Wu Yinzhu in the village as a typical case, and publicly handled it on the spot, ruling that Jiang Peigen hand over the property that Wu Yinzhu should take away, and publicized the Marriage Law to the audience, explaining the legal provisions for property division upon divorce. The remaining four divorce property cases were automatically reconciled. According to the statistics of 198 civil cases concluded by the First and Second Circuit Courts in August, September, and October last year, 54 cases were automatically withdrawn by the parties through legal education, and 75 cases were accepted for mediation. In addition, there were also many cases that were originally intended to be filed in court but were automatically resolved through legal education. According to the statistics of the Wangjiang County People's Court, after the judicial reform movement in 1952, the number of cases received per month was often around 90. Since the establishment of the three circuit courts last year, after vigorously carrying out legal publicity and education through judicial activities, the county people's court and the three circuit courts received only 56 cases in December, a decrease of nearly 40% compared with the original monthly number of cases received, which fundamentally solved the problem of backlog of cases.
    3.  Further close the relationship between the court and the grassroots government and the people. The circuit court is the best form to implement the mass line in organization. The circuit court is located in the district and township, and the cadres often patrol in the countryside, so they have a close relationship with the district and township cadres and the vast number of farmers; and because the circuit court cadres have solved many problems for the people, they have a high prestige and are trusted by the masses. For example, the district and township cadres in Changling District said: After the establishment of the circuit court, it not only helped the work of our district and township, but also helped us improve our policy level. Another example is that after the First Circuit Court mediated the mountain forest dispute among the Liu, Xie, and Sheng families in Fenghuang Township, it consolidated the unity of the farmers, and the three families reflected that the circuit court "handles affairs fairly and the method is correct." After the Second Circuit Court mediated the family dispute of military属Yun Songsheng, Yun's wife not only expressed her gratitude to the circuit court cadres on the spot, but also asked someone to write a letter to her son on the front line in Korea, encouraging him to kill the enemy and make meritorious service to thank the people's government. After the Third Circuit Court mediated the family dispute of Ni Ziyong, Ni said gratefully afterwards: "In the era of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, to fight a lawsuit, one had to spend money, travel, and entertain guests, and suffer all kinds of grievances. Now that my family is not in harmony, the court takes the initiative to come to the door to mediate. In contrast, the people's court has countless benefits."
    4.  Strengthening the leadership of mediation organizations and starting to establish a first-instance jury system. In the judicial reform and democratic nation-building movement in the county the year before last, mediation organizations were mostly established, but due to lack of leadership, they did not play a big role, and some were even dispersed. After the establishment of the three circuit courts last year, according to the principle of focusing on rectification and gradually improving, the mediation organizations of two townships were rectified in October, and in November, twelve township mediation committee meetings were held to check and arrange the mediation work, and help them formulate work plans, stipulate meeting systems and case registration systems, issue typical judgments for mediation committee members to study, and absorb mediation committee members to participate in judicial activities, and specifically strengthen the business leadership of mediation organizations. Therefore, these more than ten mediation organizations have become active again, and most mediation committee members reflect: "There is a head to do things!" Work efficiency has been significantly improved, and generally several mass disputes can be resolved every month. Played the role of assistant to the court. The First Circuit Court began to establish a jury system in Changhe Township in November last year in conjunction with the general election, which was extremely supported by the masses. Now the three courts are further creating and absorbing the experience of the first-instance jury system and gradually promoting it.
    III.
    The establishment and implementation of a new system will inevitably encounter obstacles from some conservative ideas. The people's court of the county also encountered great ideological obstacles in the early stage of establishing the circuit court.
    The first ideological obstacle was waiting for cadres. The county court believed that they had only eleven cadres, including the president, and that the manpower was insufficient, and that there was no condition to establish a circuit court, so they wanted to wait for cadres to be supplemented, or to establish a circuit court on the basis of the cadres of the people's court of the general election after the end of the general election. Later, because the Anqing Branch of the Anhui Provincial People's Court designated the county as a pilot county in the whole area, it drew out three cadres in early August last year and established the first circuit court in the range of three districts. After a period of practice, they saw the great role played by the circuit court in its work, and gradually realized that the idea of passive waiting was wrong.
    The second ideological obstacle is to be satisfied with the low-level organizational form of the circuit patrol team, believing that "the purpose of the circuit court and the circuit patrol team is to implement the mass line, and the method is to conduct circuit trials, only the name is different." The county people's court had established two circuit patrol teams after the judicial reform the year before last, so it held a "dispensable" attitude towards the establishment of a circuit court, and was not enthusiastic. Later, through the comparison of the work of the First Circuit Court and the original two circuit patrol teams, it was proved that there was a big difference between the two. The circuit court is a long-term dispatch court of the court, with fixed personnel, fixed activity areas, fixed circuit trial time and trial stations; the circuit patrol team is an organization temporarily dispatched by the court due to the needs of trial work, and is not fixed in terms of personnel, activity areas, circuit trial time and location. Because the circuit court has fixed personnel who are active in fixed areas, it is easy to be familiar with people, places, and situations, to combine with the center to handle cases, to carry out legal publicity and education, to lead mediation organizations, and to establish a first-instance jury system. Due to the temporary and unstable nature of the circuit patrol team, its role in these aspects is not great. At the same time, because the circuit court has a fixed trial location and circuit trial time, the parties can go to the station on time to file a lawsuit, ask questions, and urge execution, which is more convenient for the masses. Due to the high mobility of the circuit patrol team, the circuit trial location and time are not fixed, and the parties often have to go to the county to file a lawsuit, ask questions, and urge execution, which the masses reflect is inconvenient. Moreover, the circuit court is a dispatch court of the court, with certain powers. General civil and criminal cases can be investigated and handled on the spot. From filing a lawsuit, judgment to execution, the three can be closely connected, so the efficiency of handling cases is high, and the problem can be solved quickly and thoroughly. The circuit patrol team is generally limited to investigating and understanding the case, and the judgment must still be studied and decided by the court, and the verdict and execution must be sent to the township or entrusted to the district and township to handle, so the efficiency of handling cases is low, and the problem is not solved in time. Through the practice of work, all the cadres of the court realized that the circuit court has more advantages than the circuit patrol team, so they broke the original ideological obstacles and drew out four more cadres in September and October last year, and established the second and third circuit courts in the four districts on the basis of the original two circuit patrol teams.
    The third ideological obstacle is to be afraid of increasing the number of cases received by the court and hindering the clearing of backlog of cases, believing that after the establishment of the circuit court, the affairs of the district and township will pour into the court, and the result is "burning oneself", so they are not confident and dare not act. Facts show that this view and idea is unfounded. The establishment of the circuit court is precisely to reduce the number of cases received by the grassroots court, not to increase the number of cases. The situation of backlog of cases in the county court was very serious. After the judicial reform the year before last, the backlog of cases often had 70 or 80 cases. During the campaign to publicize and implement the Marriage Law last year, the backlog of cases once rose to more than 150 cases, and 20 or 30 parties were waiting for the court every day, and the court's work was very passive. After the establishment of the three circuit courts, the number of backlog cases gradually decreased through a series of measures such as on-site investigation, on-site handling, the use of mediation organizations, and the carrying out of legal publicity and education. According to the statistics of the court and the three circuit courts in December last year, there were only more than 30 newly received and unsettled cases, which got rid of the passive situation of long-term backlog of cases in the court and created conditions for actively serving the central task and production in the future. Moreover, the circuit court not only has high efficiency in handling cases, but also has good quality in handling cases. According to the statistics of the three circuit courts, among the 412 cases that have been concluded, only 4 cases appealed to the second-instance court due to dissatisfaction with the original judgment, and among these 4 cases, the original judgment was upheld in 3 cases, and only 1 case was partially modified. This further shows that the establishment of the circuit court not only reduces the number of cases received by the grassroots court and even the second-instance court, but also grasps policies more accurately.

    安徽望江县人民法院的巡回法庭
    最高人民法院华东分院司法行政处
    一
    安徽省望江县共八区二镇，约有二十七万人口。望江县人民法院为了更有效地为生产服务，为中心工作服务，和便利人民群众诉讼，于一九五三年八月至十月，先后成立了三个巡回法庭。各法庭管辖范围是两个区或三个区；每个法庭配备干部两人至三人，并指定其中较强的干部为组长，领导与负责法庭工作。法庭订有定期审判、定期会议、陪审及学习等各项工作制度。确定每月夏历逢一定期审判三次。工作方法是：不同性质的案件分别调解，同一类型案件集中调解；不同地区当事人在站审判，同一地区当事人，或案情复杂、牵涉面广的如山林水利等纠纷，则就地审判；一般民事与轻微刑事案件，运用调解组织或基层干部进行调解，调解不成由法庭审理判决。在审理案件时，为弄清案情，扩大法纪教育，邀请有关部门派员陪审，群众旁听。重大案件并征求当地党政领导意见，配合有关部门处理。
    二
    该县三个巡回法庭，在实际工作中提高了威信，取得党政支持与群众拥护，获得良好成绩。
    一、保障与推动了农业生产和农村中心工作的顺利进行。法庭是围绕生产与当地中心工作进行司法活动的，凡属阻碍生产与中心工作顺利进行的案件，法庭均能主动及时处理。三个巡回法庭成立后的五个月内，已处理群众性的山林水利纠纷十七件，促进了农民内部的团结，保障与推动了农业生产。如凉泉区凤凰乡刘、谢、盛三姓涉及一百四十余户的山林纠纷，历年未获解决，严重影响农民的团结和生产。第一巡回法庭了解这一情况，即主动配合区乡干部，召集双方代表进行调处，终于达成协议，订立了共同保管收益山林的公约，使三姓群众重归于好。在这次粮食统购统销中，各巡回法庭在县的统一领导下，紧密配合公安、民政、检察等部门，掌握所在区乡社会动态，通过审判，打击少数奸商，教育一般商人，保障与推动了中心工作。如奸商徐树华在统购统销中公然与政府对抗，第二巡回法庭经呈报领导机关审查批准，即予逮捕公开审判，全体到会私商都受到一次深刻的法纪教育。
    二、通过审判活动，展开法纪教育，预防了纠纷和犯罪。该县的巡回法庭用处理典型案件、公开审判、巡回就审、张贴大字判决等办法，广泛深入地对群众进行法纪教育。如该县在一九五三年秋收后赌风甚盛，不仅造成人力财力的浪费，且影响到生产与社会治安。长岭区茗南乡的王金荣因输钱盗窃群众耕牛，花河乡余清云因输钱卖田，夫妻失和。第一巡回法庭针对这一情况，即将曾当过蒋匪宪兵的赌犯耘石开判处徒刑；并印发判决书数百份，散发全县张贴，帮助区乡干部及时平息了赌风，稳定了社会秩序。又如新坝区老林乡江鸥村有男方不准许已离婚的女方带走其应带的财产案五起，久经区乡调解无效，第一巡回法庭即选定该村江培根与吴银珠一案为典型，就地公开处理，判决江培根交出吴银珠应带走的财产，并向旁听群众宣传婚姻法，说明离婚带产的法律规定，其余四起离婚带产案，即自动和解。根据第一第二两个巡回法庭去年八、九、十三个月已结一百九十八件民事案件的统计，通过法纪教育，当事人自动销案者即有五十四件，接受调解者有七十五件。此外，本来要到法庭起诉，通过法纪教育而自动解决的也不在少数。据该县人民法院统计，一九五二年司法改革运动后，每月收案经常在九十件左右，自去年三个巡回法庭相继成立，通过审判活动，大力开展法纪宣传教育后，十二月份内县人民法院与三个巡回法庭共收案件仅五十六件，较原每月收案经常数字减少近百分之四十，这就从根本上解决了积案问题。
    三、进一步密切了法院与基层政权和人民群众的关系。巡回法庭是从组织上贯彻群众路线的最好形式。巡回法庭设在区乡，干部经常在乡村巡回，因而与区乡干部和广大农民群众关系密切；又由于巡回法庭干部替人民解决了不少问题，因而威信很高，得到群众信任。如该县长岭区区乡干部说：巡回法庭建立后，不仅帮助了我们区乡的工作，而且还帮助我们提高了政策水平。又如第一巡回法庭调处好凤凰乡刘、谢、盛三姓山林纠纷后，巩固了农民内部团结，三姓群众都反映巡回法庭“办事公道，作法对头”。第二巡回法庭调处好军属耘松生家庭纠纷后，耘的妻子除当场向巡回法庭干部表示感谢外，并托人写信告知在朝鲜前线的儿子，鼓励他杀敌立功，答谢人民政府。第三巡回法庭调处好倪子雍家庭纠纷后，倪事后感激地说：“在国民党反动统治时代，打场官司，一要花钱，二要跑路，三要请客送礼，还要受尽委屈。如今我家不和，法庭主动上门调解，对比起来，人民法院真有说不尽的好处。”
    四、加强了对调解组织的领导，开始建立一审陪审制。该县在前年司法改革与民主建政运动中，调解组织大都建立起来，但由于缺乏领导，作用不大，有的且已涣散。去年三个巡回法庭相继建立后，根据重点整顿、逐步健全的方针，十月份整顿了两个乡的调解组织，十一月份又分点召开十二个乡镇的调解委员会议，检查布置了调解工作，并帮助其订立工作计划，规定会议制度与收结案件登记制度，发典型判决供调解委员学习，吸收调解委员参加审判活动，具体地加强了对调解组织的业务领导。因此这十余个调解组织又重新活跃起来，多数调解委员反映：“做事有头了！”工作效率显著提高，一般每月都能解决群众纠纷数起。发挥了法庭的助手作用。第一巡回法庭去年十一月份结合普选，在长河乡已开始建立陪审制，群众极为拥护。现在三个法庭正在进一步创造和吸取一审陪审制经验，逐步推广。
    三
    一个新制度的建立和推行，必然会遇到一些保守思想的阻碍，该县人民法院在建立巡回法庭初期，思想障碍同样是很大的。
    第一个思想障碍是等待干部。县法院认为他们连院长在内仅十一个干部，人力不足，无条件成立巡回法庭，因而想等干部补充后，或普选结束后在普选人民法庭的干部基础上，再建立巡回法庭。后因安徽省人民法院安庆分院指定该县为全专区试点县，这才于去年八月初，抽出三个干部，在三个区的范围内，建立了第一个巡回法庭。经过一个时期的实践，他们看到巡回法庭在工作中所起的巨大作用，才逐渐体会到消极等待思想是错误的。
    第二个思想障碍是满足于巡回小组的低级组织形式，认为“巡回法庭与巡回小组，目的都是贯彻群众路线，作法都是巡回就审，仅是名词上的不同”。县人民法院在前年司法改革后，已建立两个巡回小组，因而对建立巡回法庭就抱“可有可无”态度，劲头不大。以后通过第一巡回法庭与原有的两个巡回小组的工作的对比，证明两者是有很大区别的。巡回法庭是法院长期的派出庭，有固定人员，固定活动地区，固定巡回审判时间与审判站；巡回小组是法院因审判工作的需要，临时派出的组织，在人员、活动地区、巡回审判时间与地点等方面，都是不固定的。由于巡回法庭有固定的人员在固定的地区活动，因此人熟、地熟、情况熟，便于结合中心处理案件，开展法纪宣传教育，领导调解组织，建立一审陪审制。巡回小组由于临时性和不稳定性，在这些方面的作用不大。同时，由于巡回法庭有固定的审判地点与巡回审判时间，当事人起诉、问事、催执行等都可按时到站，更便利了群众。巡回小组由于流动性大，巡回审判地点与时间都不固定，当事人起诉、问事、催执行往往还需到县里去，群众反映不便。而且，巡回法庭是法院的派出庭，有一定职权，一般民刑案件，可以就地调查，就地处理，从起诉、判决到执行，三者可紧密衔接，因此办案效率大，解决问题既快又彻底。巡回小组一般多限于调查了解案情，判决仍必须到法院研究决定，而宣判执行又需派人下乡或委托区乡代办，因此办案效率低，解决问题不及时。通过工作的实践，该院全体干部认识到巡回法庭比巡回小组具有更多的优越性，这才打破原有的思想障碍，在去年九、十两月又相继抽出四个干部，在原有两个巡回小组基础上，划定四个区，建立了第二、第三两个巡回法庭。
    第三个思想障碍是怕增加法院收案而妨碍清理积案，认为建立巡回法庭后，区乡事务都涌到法庭，其结果是“惹火烧身”，因而信心不高，迟迟不敢动手。事实说明，这种看法和想法是没有根据的。建立巡回法庭，正是为了减轻基层法院的收案而不是增加收案。该县法院积案情况原甚严重，前年司法改革后，积案也经常有七八十件，去年宣传贯彻婚姻法运动月中，积案曾一度上升至一百五十余件，每天都有当事人二三十人坐候法院，法院工作十分被动。三个巡回法庭成立后，通过就地调查，就地处理，运用调解组织，开展法纪宣传教育等一系列措施，积案数字逐渐下降。据去年十二月该院与三个巡回法庭统计，仅有新收未结案的案件三十余件，摆脱了该院长期积案的被动局面，给今后主动为中心任务、为生产服务创造了条件。而且，巡回法庭不仅办案效率高，办案质量也好，据该院三个巡回法庭的统计，在已结案四百一十二件中，不服原判上诉二审法院的仅四件，而这四件中维持原判的有三件，部分改判的仅一件。这就进一步说明巡回法庭的建立，不仅减少了基层法院收案以至二审法院的收案，而且掌握政策也较准确。
