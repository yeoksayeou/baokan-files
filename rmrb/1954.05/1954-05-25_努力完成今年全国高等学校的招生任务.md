    The "Regulations on the 1954 Summer Enrollment of New Students in National Colleges and Universities" issued by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has been announced. In mid-July, examinations will be held simultaneously in seventy-seven examination areas across the country under the unified plan of the Central Government to select qualified new students for national colleges and universities. The national college enrollment work is an extremely arduous and meticulous organizational task. Doing this work well is the primary step to ensuring that national colleges and universities train various construction talents correspondingly during the national transition period. Therefore, relevant departments at the central and local levels must carefully plan and closely cooperate in accordance with the regulations on college enrollment to make all preparations.
    Since the implementation of unified enrollment nationwide in 1952, the national college enrollment plan has been basically and comprehensively completed. In 1953, the previous experiences and lessons were conscientiously summarized, and the policy of unified enrollment was clearly pointed out: under the principle of unified enrollment, attention should be paid to the requirements and characteristics of different schools and departments, attention should be paid to the quality of applicants, the work of graduates from workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools and revolutionary cadres entering colleges and universities should be well done, and ideological education for college entrance guidance should be strengthened. As a result, the enrollment rate of new students has increased significantly, and the quality of students has also improved significantly compared with previous years. However, as far as the enrollment work in 1953 is concerned, due to insufficient understanding of the complexity of the enrollment work by the leadership and excessive concentration of specific affairs in the National College Enrollment Committee, the strength of relevant departments in various regions and various colleges and universities and senior high schools was not fully organized and utilized; in addition, the examination period was late, the time was tight, and the plan was not thorough enough, resulting in many shortcomings in the enrollment work. First, the ideological education for college entrance guidance before the examination was not timely, universal, or in-depth, failing to enable students to choose schools and departments based on the overall needs of national construction and their own actual conditions, resulting in excessive concentration of applicants for certain departments and certain schools, expanding the number of people allocated in the plan. Second, in terms of planned allocation, it was not adapted enough to the characteristics of each school and department, and it was not combined enough with the students' academic performance and aspirations, which affected the learning enthusiasm of some new students.
    In order to effectively ensure that colleges and universities can enroll qualified new students this year, based on the experience of previous enrollment work and the current development status of colleges and senior high schools in our country, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and the Ministry of Education of the Central Government have carefully formulated the "Regulations on the 1954 Summer Enrollment of New Students in National Colleges and Universities," and determined that national colleges and universities will continue to implement unified enrollment under the leadership of the central unified plan this year. This measure is completely necessary. This is because there are three fundamental problems in the current college enrollment work in our country, and these problems must be solved step by step by adopting the method of unified enrollment. First, there is an insufficient source of students. Senior high school graduates are the main source of new students, but the number of senior high school graduates in 1952 was only 65% of the enrollment task, 76% in 1953, and 77% this year. Second, the number of senior high school graduates in major administrative regions and the college enrollment tasks in each region are unbalanced. For example, in some regions, the enrollment task is large but the source of students is small, while in some regions, the enrollment task is small but the source of students is large. Third, there is a large gap between students' aspirations and the enrollment plan that meets the overall needs of the country. Students' aspirations are mostly concentrated in a few schools and a few departments, and the enrollment requirements of many departments and schools cannot be realized. These situations show that before the number of senior high school graduates reaches the number commensurate with the college enrollment requirements, only by adopting the method of unified enrollment under the leadership of the central unified plan can all applicants be comprehensively enrolled and allocated based on their political quality, examination results, and health conditions, with reference to their aspirations, and in accordance with the national enrollment plan, to ensure the completion of the national college enrollment plan. The regulations for the enrollment of new students this year also clearly propose that under the unified plan of the Central Government, the higher education bureaus and education bureaus of major administrative regions, together with the colleges and universities in each region, should organize enrollment committees to be responsible for handling the registration, examination, enrollment allocation, and organization of registration in each region, and be responsible for handling some specific issues after enrollment. This can correct the past tendency of excessive concentration in dealing with problems and further give play to the strength and enthusiasm of major administrative regions and various colleges and universities, so as to achieve enrollment according to talent, reasonable allocation, and timely resolution of problems. These measures will greatly help the smooth progress of enrollment work.
    On the other hand, in order to effectively overcome the shortcomings of past enrollment work, it is also necessary to do a good job in ideological education in terms of college entrance guidance, which is to educate students to obey the overall needs of national construction and correctly put forward learning aspirations, so as to successfully complete the enrollment plan. In the past, although this work has also achieved some results, it has not achieved the due effect and must be effectively improved. The reason why too many candidates were concentrated in a few schools and a few departments in the past was mainly because many students lacked a comprehensive understanding of the national construction cause and lacked a correct understanding of the meaning of key undertakings and non-key undertakings. It is necessary to make them truly understand that all work needed by the country and the people is equally valued by the Party and the People's Government; as long as you have the spirit of diligently serving the people, you can give full play to your creative wisdom and creative talents in any work and make outstanding achievements. And the difference between key undertakings and non-key undertakings is only the difference in the order of priority in a certain period. Various regions and relevant departments, especially local secondary schools, should refer to the college entrance guidance manuals compiled and printed by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, combined with the students' ideological situation and specific conditions, and obtain the close cooperation of the school Party and Youth League organizations, to conduct centralized and comprehensive ideological education on college entrance guidance to students, so that students can understand the overall needs of national construction, understand the professional settings of national colleges and universities, and fill in learning aspirations realistically based on their own specific conditions. At the same time, national senior high school teachers should, before the examination, assist students as much as possible to carefully prepare lessons according to the examination syllabus of various subjects issued by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, so as to consolidate the achievements of various subjects. Education departments in various provinces and cities should, from now until the enrollment of new college students, regularly inspect and supervise various secondary schools and exchange experiences in a timely manner, so that all senior high school graduates in the country can receive sufficient and correct ideological education on college entrance.
    Our country is currently in urgent need of a large number of high-level construction talents in various construction undertakings. The college enrollment plan is formulated according to the national construction plan, and whether the enrollment plan can be completed will directly affect the implementation of the national construction plan. This year's enrollment work is very arduous. Various regions and relevant departments should actively carry out preparatory work in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and the Ministry of Education of the Central Government, and strive to successfully complete this major task.

### 努力完成今年全国高等学校的招生任务

    努力完成今年全国高等学校的招生任务
    中央人民政府高等教育部、中央人民政府教育部“关于全国高等学校一九五四年暑期招考新生的规定”公布了。七月中旬将在中央统一计划下在全国七十七个考区同时举行考试，为全国高等学校录取合格的新生。全国高等学校招生工作，是极为繁重细致的组织工作。做好这个工作，是保证全国高等学校在国家过渡时期相应地培养各项建设人才的首要步骤。因此，中央及各地的有关部门，必须根据高等学校招考新生的规定，周密计划，密切配合，做好一切准备工作。
    自一九五二年实行全国范围的统一招生以来，基本上全面地完成了全国高等学校招生计划。一九五三年认真地总结了以往的经验教训，明确地指出了统一招生的方针是在统一招生的原则下，照顾不同学校不同系科的要求和特点，注意报考学生的质量，作好工农速成中学毕业生及革命干部升入高等学校的工作，加强升学指导的思想教育，结果新生入学报到率显著提高，学生质量也比往年有显著提高。但就一九五三年的招生工作来说，由于领导方面对招生工作的复杂性认识不足，过多地把具体事务集中在全国高等学校招生委员会，没有充分组织和发挥各地区有关部门及各高等学校和各高级中学的力量；加以考期较迟，时间紧迫，计划不够周密，致使招生工作仍有不少缺点。首先是考试前升学指导教育不及时、不普遍、不深入，未能使学生根据国家建设的全面需要和自己的实际条件来选择学校和系科专业，以致报考某些系科和某些学校者过分集中，扩大了计划分配的人数。其次是在计划分配上，适应各校、各系科的特点不够，结合学生的在校成绩和志愿不够，影响了一部分新生的学习积极性。
    为了有效地保证高等学校今年能够录取合格的新生，根据往年的招生工作经验和当前我国高等学校和高级中学的发展状况，中央高等教育部、中央教育部审慎地制定了“关于全国高等学校一九五四年暑期招考新生的规定”，确定今年全国高等学校仍实行在中央统一计划领导下的统一招生。这种措施是完全必要的。这是因为目前我国高等学校招生工作中存在着三个根本问题，而这些问题，必须采取统一招生的办法，有步骤地加以解决。第一，是学生来源不足。高中毕业生是新生的主要来源，而一九五二年高中毕业生仅相当于招生任务的百分之六十五，一九五三年为百分之七十六，今年为百分之七十七。第二，各大行政区高级中学毕业生的数量和各该区高等学校招生任务不平衡。如有些地区，招生任务大而学生来源少，有些地区，则招生任务小而学生来源多。第三，学生志愿和适应国家全面需要的招生计划有很大距离。学生志愿多半集中在少数学校和少数系科，很多系科和学校的招生要求无法实现。这些情况说明，在高中毕业生尚未达到与高等学校招生要求相适应的数目以前，只有采取在中央统一计划领导下的统一招生的办法，才能对所有的报考学生，根据其政治质量、考试成绩和健康条件，参照其志愿，并按照国家招生计划全面地进行录取分配，以保证全国高等学校招生计划的完成。今年招考新生的规定中又明确地提出了在中央统一计划下，由各大行政区高等教育局、教育局会同各该区高等学校组织招生委员会，负责办理各该区报名、考试、录取分配和组织报到等工作，并负责处理录取后的一些具体问题。这就可以纠正往年在处理问题上过分集中的偏向，进一步发挥各大行政区及各高等学校的力量和积极性，以便做到因材录取，合理调配，及时解决问题。这些措施，都将大大有助于招生工作的顺利进行。
    而在另一方面，为了有效地克服过去招生工作的缺点，还必须在升学指导方面做好思想教育工作，这是教育学生服从祖国建设的全面需要，正确提出学习志愿，以便胜利完成招生计划。往年，这一工作虽也取得一些成绩，但还没有取得应有的效果，必须切实加以改进。过去所以产生过多考生集中在少数学校和少数系科的现象，主要因为不少学生对国家建设事业缺乏全面的了解，对重点事业和非重点事业的含义缺乏正确的认识。要使他们真正懂得：凡是国家和人民所需要的工作，同样受到党和人民政府的重视；只要你有勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的精神，在任何工作中都能够发挥自己的创造智慧和创造才能，做出卓越的成绩来。而重点事业和非重点事业的区别，仅仅是在一定时期的先后缓急的区别。各地区、各有关部门特别是各地中等学校，应当参照中央高等教育部编印的升学指导手册，结合学生的思想情况和具体条件，并取得学校党、团组织的密切配合，集中地全面地向学生进行升学指导的思想教育，使学生认识国家建设的全面需要，了解全国各高等学校的专业设置情况，根据自己的具体条件，实事求是地填写学习志愿。同时全国高级中学教师们应该在考试前尽可能辅导学生根据中央高等教育部发布的各种学科考试大纲认真备课，以巩固各种学科的成绩。各省、市教育部门，则应从现在起直到高等学校新生入学止，对各中学经常检查督促，及时交流经验，使全国高中毕业学生都能受到充分的、正确的关于升学的思想教育。
    我们国家目前在各种建设事业上都迫切需要大量的高级建设人才。高等学校的招生计划是根据国家建设计划制定的，招生计划的能否完成，将直接影响国家建设计划的实施。今年招生工作是十分艰巨的，各地区、各有关部门，应该根据中央高等教育部、中央教育部的规定，积极进行准备工作，为胜利完成这一重大任务而努力。
