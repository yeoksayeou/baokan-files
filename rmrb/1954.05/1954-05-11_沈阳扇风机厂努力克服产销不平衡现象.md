The Shenyang Fan Factory has increased the production of new varieties and strengthened its marketing efforts, exceeding its sales plan for April by 20.4 percent.

In the first quarter of this year, the factory only completed about 75 percent of its sales plan. The reason was that the factory was blind in the production of varieties, with some products in oversupply. On the other hand, dozens of products had few or no orders due to their old designs and low efficiency. In addition, some sales personnel in the factory were not familiar with the types, specifications, and performance of fans, making it difficult to explain the uses and characteristics of the products to users. Some cadres had the mistaken idea that "if they want it, they can have it; if they don't want it, forget it; selling one less is nothing to me."

In order to change this situation, the factory first criticized various erroneous ideas about not actively and responsibly promoting products, and from late March, organized relevant sales personnel to study general knowledge about fans. Personnel from the Planning Section and Supply and Marketing Section went to fraternal factories and mines in Anshan and other places to actively promote and solicit various tasks. A factory in Shanxi needed a type of fan. After Wang Zhongxian of the Business Section of the Supply and Marketing Department of the Fan Factory patiently explained and helped select samples, they ordered twenty-four units. When promoting products, sales personnel paid special attention to the fan requirements of various departments and their opinions, in order to increase varieties as soon as possible according to the actual needs of each unit, thus avoiding the blindness of production and the passive situation of marketing work. Since April, the factory's transportation department has been handling balance procedures and consignment procedures for customers, establishing close contact with users.

The factory has also systematically increased new products in response to user requests. For example, the Shenyang Wire Factory needed high-temperature resistant fans, and the Fan Factory overcame many difficulties to trial-produce this specification of product, which will be completed in September this year. Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Fushun Mining Bureau, Harbin Instrument Factory and other units, hearing that the Fan Factory could make this product, also signed orders. The factory is also trial-producing high-pressure turbine fans for use in various factories and mines. In addition, small fans and automatic coal feeding machines will also be completed in June this year.

### 沈阳扇风机厂努力克服产销不平衡现象

    沈阳扇风机厂努力克服产销不平衡现象
    沈阳扇风机厂增产新品种，加强推销工作，四月份超额百分之二十点四完成了销售计划。
    今年第一季度，该厂只完成销售计划的百分之七十五左右。原因是该厂在生产的品种上存在着盲目性，有些产品供过于求；另一方面，有数十种产品，因样子老、效率不高，订货户很少，甚至于没有订货的。加上该厂某些推销人员对扇风机的品种、规格、性能不熟悉，很难向用户解释产品的用处和特点；部分干部存在着“愿要就要、不要拉倒、少卖一台与我无关”的错误思想。
    为了改变这种情况，该厂首先批判了不积极负责地推销产品的各种错误思想，并自三月下旬开始组织有关推销人员学习有关扇风机的一般知识。计划科、供销科人员分赴鞍山等地各兄弟厂矿主动推销和揽杂活。山西某厂需要一种扇风机，经扇风机厂供销科业务股王仲贤的耐心讲解和帮助选样，订了二十四台。推销人员在推销产品时，特别注意了各部门需要扇风机的情形和他们的意见，以便及早根据各单位实际需要，增加品种，这样就避免了生产的盲目性和推销工作的被动情况。该厂运输部门自四月份开始为订户代办平衡手续和托运手续，与用户建立紧密的联系。
    该厂针对用户的要求，也有计划地增加了新产品。例如沈阳电线厂需要耐温送风机，扇风机厂克服了很多困难来试制这种规格的产品，今年九月就可出成品。鞍山钢铁公司、抚顺矿务局、哈尔滨仪表厂等单位，听到扇风机厂能做这种产品，也都签订了订货合同。该厂又试制着高压透平送风机，以便供应各厂矿使用。另外，小型送风机和自动送风打煤机也将在今年六月试制完成。
