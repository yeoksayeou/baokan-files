Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 29th — The Geneva Conference continued on the afternoon of the 29th. Prince Wan Waithayakon (i.e., Prince Naradhip), the representative of Thailand, presided over the meeting.

    The first speaker at the meeting on the 29th was Casey, the representative of Australia. In his speech, Casey supported Dulles' unreasonable demands on the Korean issue. Although he had to admit that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal was "worthy of careful consideration," he believed that the Korean elections should be "supervised" by the United Nations, and repeated Dulles's rhetoric to defend American aggression and the long-term stationing of American troops in Korea.

    The next speaker was Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov first expressed regret that Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Pakistan were not participating in this conference to solve urgent Asian problems. But he then stated that this conference was the first time in many years that all major powers—France, Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union—had participated together, and the participation of the major Asian power, the People's Republic of China, was extremely beneficial to the conference. He pointed out that the United Nations had proven incapable of resolving the Korean issue due to American manipulation. Therefore, the Geneva Conference should do its best to enable the Korean people to establish an independent, unified, and democratic country through peaceful means. Foreign Minister Molotov elaborated in detail on the tremendous changes that had taken place in Asia since the October Revolution, especially after World War II, and particularly the victory of China, which meant that any solution to Asian problems must be in line with the interests of the Asian people. However, the United States ignored the new situation in Asia and continued to adopt old-fashioned imperialist colonial policies, especially the hostile and aggressive policies it adopted towards the new China. This was the main obstacle to the peaceful resolution of Asian problems. But he said that due to the awakening of the Asian people, any colonialist policy was bound to fail. Finally, Molotov expressed his support for Foreign Minister Zhou's opinion that the Asian people should unite to defend peace in Asia, and believed that Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal should be the basis for discussing and resolving the Korean issue.

    After Foreign Minister Molotov's speech, since no one else had registered to speak, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting until the 30th.
    TASS, Geneva, 30th — The Foreign Ministers' meeting on April 29th was chaired by Prince Naradhip (Thailand), and the discussion on the Korean issue continued.

    The discussion process clearly demonstrated that the Korean issue is linked to some general Asian problems that are of great significance to guaranteeing universal peace and security. Broad public opinion believes that the participation of the People's Republic of China, along with France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, in the Geneva Conference has greatly increased the possibility of achieving a peaceful and fair resolution of the issues on the agenda.

    The speeches by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai yesterday once again demonstrated that there are two completely different attitudes, not only in resolving the Korean issue but also in resolving other urgent Asian problems. The characteristic of the American attitude towards these problems is to disregard the legitimate interests of the people of Asian countries and insist on refusing to recognize the fundamental changes of decisive significance that have taken place in Asia since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This is also acknowledged by many bourgeois newspapers. For example, the Parisian "Le Monde" emphasized the contradiction between "the Western policy directed by the United States and the true interests of the people of Asian countries." The newspaper said that the unique feature of this "Western policy" is that it ignores the economic, social, and psychological characteristics of the current situation in Asia.

    Dulles's speech on the 28th completely confirmed this. Some political commentators in Geneva pointed out, based on Dulles's speech, that the U.S. Secretary of State had not made the slightest effort to seek a solution to the major problems facing the Geneva Conference.

    These commentators believe that, unlike Dulles's speech, the speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China was a major contribution to this conference, which was convened to peacefully and fairly resolve the most pressing Asian problems. Zhou Enlai's speech was a fervent and forceful proof that neither the Korean issue nor other issues closely related to strengthening peace can be resolved if the United States does not abandon its current policies towards the People's Republic of China and the people of other Asian countries, and if it does not abandon policies that run counter to the wishes of the people of Asian countries. Zhou Enlai pointed out that Dulles's attitude on this issue is completely inconsistent with the interests of the Asian people, and only when these interests are recognized can peace and global security be guaranteed.

    The speech by the head of the Soviet delegation, Foreign Minister Molotov, at the meeting on the 29th, became the focus of everyone's attention. This speech aroused great interest in everyone. Molotov's speech once again fully proved that the Soviet Union's foreign policy has no other purpose than to consolidate world peace, and that this policy continues to play a major role in easing tensions in the Far East and around the world and in safeguarding the legitimate rights of the people of all countries.

    Molotov analyzed the Korean issue in detail, saying that, in the opinion of the Soviet delegation, the proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea could serve as the basis for the adoption of an appropriate resolution on the Korean issue. Molotov also stated that the Soviet delegation fully agreed with Zhou Enlai's opinion that Asian countries should work together to ensure peace in Asia. At the meeting on the 29th to discuss the Korean issue, Australian Foreign Minister Casey also spoke. Like Dulles, he attempted to portray the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, which were passed by the American majority in the United Nations and aimed at maintaining American control over Korea, as a method of resolving the Korean issue. However, Casey also apparently felt that this position was difficult to defend, and therefore said that he believed that the proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, "although insufficient in some important respects, are still worthy of careful discussion." Casey raised some questions about individual points in Nam Il's proposal, attempting to obscure the obvious implications of these points. Casey opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, thus exposing his true intentions.

    The next meeting of the Foreign Ministers is scheduled to be held on April 30th.

### 日内瓦会议二十九日下午继续举行  莫洛托夫就朝鲜问题发言  支持周外长的意见和南日外务相的建议

    日内瓦会议二十九日下午继续举行
    莫洛托夫就朝鲜问题发言
    支持周外长的意见和南日外务相的建议
    【新华社日内瓦二十九日电】日内瓦会议二十九日下午继续举行。泰国代表旺·威泰耶康亲王（即：那拉底亲王）担任主席。
    在二十九日会议上首先发言的是澳大利亚代表凯西。凯西在其发言中支持杜勒斯对朝鲜问题的无理主张。他虽不得不承认南日外务相所提建议“值得仔细考虑”，但却认为朝鲜选举应由联合国“监督”，并重复杜勒斯的论调，为美国的侵略及美军长期留驻朝鲜作辩护。
    接着发言的是苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫。莫洛托夫首先对这一解决亚洲迫切问题的会议没有印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦等亚洲国家参加表示遗憾。但他接着称，这次会议是一切大国——法、英、美、中、苏多年来第一次共同参加的一个会议，特别是亚洲的大国——中华人民共和国的参加，对会议极有贡献。他指出，联合国由于美国的操纵对解决朝鲜问题已表现无能，因此，日内瓦会议应该尽力，以使朝鲜人民能用和平的方法建立一个独立、统一、民主的国家。莫洛托夫外长详细阐述了十月革命后，尤其在第二次世界大战后亚洲所发生的巨大变化，特别是中国的胜利，使对任何亚洲问题的解决，都必须符合亚洲人民的利益。但美国却无视亚洲的新形势，而继续采用陈旧的帝国主义的殖民政策，特别是对新中国所采取的敌视和侵略的政策。这是和平解决亚洲问题的主要障碍。但他说，由于亚洲人民的觉醒，任何殖民主义政策都是一定要失败的。最后，莫洛托夫表示支持我周外长关于亚洲人民团结起来保卫亚洲和平的意见，并认为南日外务相的建议应成为讨论与解决朝鲜问题的基础。
    莫洛托夫外长发言后，由于没人报名发言，主席即宣告休会，至三十日再继续举行。
     【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社日内瓦三十日讯：外长会议四月二十九日的会议由那拉底亲王（泰国）担任主席，会上继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    讨论过程特别清楚地表明：朝鲜问题与对保障普遍的和平与安全有重大意义的一些亚洲普遍问题有着联系。广大的舆论认为，中华人民共和国与法国、英国、美国、苏联一道出席日内瓦会议，就大大增加了会议议程上的问题获得和平和公平解决的可能性。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯和中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来昨日的发言又一次表明：不仅是在解决朝鲜问题上，就是在解决其他一些急迫的亚洲问题上，都存在着两种截然不同的态度。美国对这些问题的态度的特点就是：无视亚洲各国人民的合法利益，坚持不愿承认中华人民共和国成立之后在亚洲所发生的有决定性意义的根本变化。这一点是许多资产阶级报纸也都承认的。如巴黎的“世界报”就着重指出，“为美国所指使的西方政策与亚洲各国人民的真正的利益之间”存在着矛盾。该报说，这一“西方政策”的独特之处是：它忽视目前亚洲局势中的经济、社会和心理方面的特征。
    杜勒斯二十八日的发言就完全证实了这一点。日内瓦的一些政治评论员根据杜勒斯的发言指出，美国国务卿根本没有尽一点努力来谋求解决日内瓦会议所面临的重大问题。
    这些评论员认为，中华人民共和国外交部部长的发言就和杜勒斯的发言不同，他的发言，是对这个为了和平而公正地解决最迫切的亚洲问题而召开的会议的一个重大贡献。周恩来的发言就是一个热烈而有力的证据，证明如果美国不放弃它目前对中华人民共和国和亚洲其他各国人民的政策，如果它不放弃这种与亚洲各国人民的愿望背道而驰的政策，无论是朝鲜问题或其他与加强和平有密切关系的问题都是不能解决的。周恩来指出，杜勒斯在这个问题上所表明的态度，完全不符合亚洲人民的利益，只有这些利益得到承认，和平和全世界的安全才能得到保证。
    苏联代表团首席代表、外交部长莫洛托夫在二十九日会议上的发言，成为大家注意的中心。这篇发言引起大家极大的兴趣。莫洛托夫的发言又一次充分地证明苏联的外交政策除了巩固世界和平以外没有任何其他的目的，证明这种政策在缓和远东和全世界的紧张局势和维护世界各国人民的合法权利方面继续不断地起着主要作用。
    莫洛托夫详尽地分析了朝鲜问题，他说：照苏联代表团的意见，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日提出的建议是可以作为通过关于朝鲜问题的适当决议的基础的。莫洛托夫还表示，苏联代表团完全同意周恩来提出的关于亚洲各国齐心协力保障亚洲和平的意见。在二十九日会议讨论朝鲜问题时，发言的还有澳大利亚外交部部长凯西。他像杜勒斯一样，企图把在联合国中美国多数所通过的、旨在保持美国对朝鲜的统治的联合国大会的决议，说成是解决朝鲜问题的方法。可是，凯西也显然感到这种立场的难以站得住脚，因而说道：他认为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出的建议“虽然在某些重要的地方不够充分，但仍然值得加以仔细的讨论”。凯西对南日的建议中的个别几点提出了一些问题，企图就此含糊这几点的明显的含意。凯西反对从朝鲜撤出美国军队，因而就暴露了他的真正意图。
    外长会议下次会议定于四月三十日举行。
