    Shanghai Public Security Organs Actively Improve Traffic Management

    After the Red Flag competition, Shanghai's traffic management has greatly improved.

    Shanghai has a large population and a network of streets. On the city's more than 1,400 roads, pedestrians are constantly flowing, and tens of thousands of vehicles travel back and forth. Before liberation, traffic accidents, deaths, and injuries occurred every minute on Shanghai's roads. After liberation, the People's Government Public Security Organs rectified and reformed traffic management, establishing a new traffic order in the city. Since October of last year, a Red Flag competition has been launched among traffic police, continuing to implement a district-by-district, section-by-section responsibility system throughout the city, organizing 272 working groups to manage traffic safety in each section. At the same time, traffic police frequently conduct in-depth traffic safety publicity and education work among drivers and citizens. In the past six months, traffic accidents in the city have gradually decreased. From January to April this year, the number of traffic accidents in the city decreased by 44.9% compared with the same period last year.

    Shanghai's traffic police actively study their work and have created many methods for managing traffic order. They have adopted methods such as "fast traffic light adjustment" and flow rate organization to accelerate vehicle turnover, not only making vehicle travel safe and fast, but also enabling many Shanghai buses to create a record of "arriving on time, with no difference in seconds." In the Putuo District, where factories are concentrated, the Yichang Road Bridge and Caojiadu five-way intersection, which used to experience traffic congestion, now have traffic police safety working groups, basically eliminating traffic accidents. Many traffic police officers actively help the elderly and young children cross the road. Under their guidance, car drivers and rickshaw workers have been able to consciously abide by traffic regulations, and thousands of rickshaws drive sequentially in the slow lanes or park in an orderly manner in parking lots waiting for passengers. People can now cross the road calmly without any fear. Due to the efforts of these traffic police in the people's traffic work, 268 of them have been commended and rewarded by the People's Government. Luo Qixiang, a policeman at Post No. 1 in Luwan District, commanded flexibly and adjusted traffic lights accurately, and no traffic accident occurred in nine months, receiving two awards. Xu Da, a policeman at Post No. 18 in Laozha District, directs more than 5,000 vehicles every hour, and is safe and sound every day, receiving praise from many citizens. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海市公安机关积极改进交通管理工作
    上海市交通管理工作经过红旗竞赛后，有了很大改进。
    上海市人口众多，街道纵横，在全市一千四百多条马路上，每天行人络绎不断，数以万计的车辆在穿梭通行。解放前，上海市的马路上每分钟都要发生撞车和死伤等事故。解放后，人民政府公安机关对交通管理工作进行了整顿和改革，在全市建立了新的交通秩序。从去年十月份起，又在交通民警中展开了红旗竞赛，继续在全市实行分区分段包干负责制，组织了二百七十二个工作小组，管理每一地段的交通安全工作。同时，交通民警还经常向驾驶员和市民深入进行交通安全的宣传教育工作。半年多来，全市交通事故逐渐减少。今年一月到四月全市发生的交通事故比去年同一时期减少了百分之四十四点九。
    上海市的交通民警在工作中积极钻研业务，创造了许多管理交通秩序的办法。他们采用了“快速调灯法”和流速整理等方法，加速了车辆的流转，不仅使车辆行驶又安全又迅速，并使上海市的许多公共汽车创造了“准点到站，差秒不差分”的纪录。在工厂比较集中的普陀区，过去常常发生交通拥挤现象的宜昌路桥和曹家渡五叉路，现在有了交通民警安全工作组，基本上消灭了交通事故。许多交通民警都主动帮助老年人和幼儿过路。在他们指导下，汽车驾驶员和三轮车工人已能自觉地遵守交通秩序，成千上万的三轮车依次行驶在慢车道上或井然有序地停在停车场等待乘客。人们已经可以不怀着任何恐怖心理而从容不迫地穿过马路。由于这些交通民警对人民交通工作的努力，他们之中已有二百六十八人受到人民政府的表扬和奖励。卢湾区一号岗民警罗其祥指挥灵活，调灯准确，九个月中未发生一件交通事故，得到两次奖励。老闸区十八号岗民警许达每小时指挥着五千多辆车子，天天安全无事，受到许多市民的好评。　（新华社）
