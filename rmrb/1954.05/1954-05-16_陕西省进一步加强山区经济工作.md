The total amount of loans issued by the Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China to farmers in mountainous areas this year will increase by about 15% compared with last year, and nearly 20 billion yuan of loans have now been issued. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Shaanxi Province are continuously transporting a large number of means of production such as farm tools, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery and medicines, as well as daily necessities such as fabrics and general merchandise to mountainous areas.

    陕西省进一步加强山区经济工作
    陕西省人民政府今年进一步加强山区的经济工作。一千多名农业、水利技术干部正深入山区，帮助农民兴修农田水利和进行农业技术改革工作，并根据各个山区的具体情况，有区别地发展农业、林业、畜牧业以及各种副业。中国人民银行陕西省分行今年向山区农民贷款总数将比去年增加百分之十五左右，现在发放的贷款已近两百亿元。陕西省国营商业部门和供销合作社正源源把许多农具、肥料、农业药械等生产资料和布匹、百货等日用品运往山区。今年陕西省山区的国营商业机构已由去年的一百二十六个增加到一百四十七个。国营商业部门今年已在山区收购的土产特产以及野畜皮等都比去年增加。截至三月底止，据陕西省贸易公司在山区的二十多个机构统计，今年收购的药材、五棓子、漆油等较去年同期增加百分之七十四。中国畜产公司西北区公司在陕西省安康、榆林等五个地区收购的野猪、竹鼠、九江狸子等野畜皮价值达四亿二千多万元，收购的品种较去年增加了十种。绥德专区各县所产的白瓜子，过去一向无人经营，今年由于供销合作社收购，使农民增加收益达一亿二千多万元。今年山区各地供销合作社除供应农民一部分新式农具、药械外，并着重组织当地手工业者制造各种铁、木、竹器农具，以适应山区农民的需要。今年第一季度，国营商业机构和供销合作社供应山区农民生活资料的总值，较去年同期增加两倍以上。这些生活资料的价格较去年十二月份的价格便宜了百分之零点四到三点八。此外，供销合作社在山区也得到很大发展，仅商雒、榆林两专区供销合作社的门市部和货摊子就较去年增加一倍。陕西省人民政府交通厅今年还拨款十四亿元整修山区的偏僻小路，便利农民生产和物资交流。
    陕西省山区主要分布在南部的安康、商雒和北部的榆林、绥德等六个专区，耕地面积占全省总耕地面积百分之五十四以上，人口占全省总人口百分之四十八以上。几年来，由于各地党政领导机关的重视，山区经济已有了发展。今年山区各地人民政府又制订了继续加强山区经济工作的全面计划，以进一步改变山区的经济面貌。　　　　　（新华社）
