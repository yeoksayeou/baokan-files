Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 25th: The World Peace Council's Berlin Special Session continued its meetings on the afternoon of the 24th. The attending representatives continued to speak.

    Heitaro Hirano, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out in his speech that the United States' explosion of a hydrogen bomb violated the universally recognized principles of international law regarding freedom of navigation on the high seas. He expressed his belief that the pressure of the peace movement could lead to the prohibition of such inhumane weapons. Hirano said: We have already started collecting signatures to ban atomic weapons and oppose the testing of atomic weapons. The movement to ban thermonuclear weapons is not only part of the peace movement but also the most important part. On behalf of the Japanese people, he suggested that the World Peace Council appeal to the five major powers and other countries to ban atomic weapons and establish an international organization to supervise the implementation of the ban.

    After speeches by Professor Leopold Infeld (Poland), Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, and General Sahib Singh Sokhey, recipient of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations," Max Cosyns, Chairman of the National Committee of the Belgian Peace Union and a scientist, spoke. He pointed out that all the uranium mined in the Congo was being used by the United States for military purposes. He said that most of the world's uranium is currently used in the war industry and must be used for peaceful purposes.

    Chandra, Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council, read out a congratulatory letter from Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, at the meeting.

    In his congratulatory letter, Kitchlew considered the convening of the Geneva Conference a great victory for the forces of peace. He quoted Nehru's speech on May 15: "...For us, the newly liberated Asian countries, peace is not only a devout hope but also an urgent necessity. In a sense, the fate of Asia largely depends on what happens in Indochina or Korea."

    The congratulatory letter said that the danger of war is particularly evident to India, and the US-Pakistan military treaty has brought this danger directly to our country's borders. This is a step detrimental to peace in Asia and the world.

    Kitchlew put forward the demands of Indian peace fighters in his congratulatory letter:

    First, the People's Republic of China should be granted its legitimate status in the United Nations.

    Second, fully support the proposals made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru regarding the Indochina issue, as well as the Indian government's stance on prohibiting the transportation of foreign troops through Indian territory. Demand an immediate ceasefire in Indochina and guarantee the full freedom of the people of the three Indochinese countries, as well as guarantee that foreign countries do not interfere.

    Third, demand urgent measures to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War, and guarantee the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea so that the Korean people can freely determine their own destiny.

    Fourth, demand that the major powers currently represented at the Geneva Conference guarantee the people of Asian countries the right to self-determination and full independence as a foundation for establishing peace in Asia.

    Fifth, oppose any military actions and alliances aimed at depriving Asian countries of freedom and independence, and demand that the World Peace Council announce a more resolute protest against the policies of colonialism and racial discrimination practiced in Africa and elsewhere.

    Kitchlew concluded his congratulatory letter by emphasizing the recently signed agreement between China and India on trade and transportation between the Tibet region of China and India. He said that the most important principles of this agreement are: mutual respect for territorial integrity, guaranteeing non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. He hoped to conclude similar agreements with all neighboring countries and all countries.

    The meeting adjourned after the congratulatory letter from Dr. Kitchlew was read.

    Xinhua News Agency: The World Peace Council's Berlin Special Session on the morning of May 25 was chaired by Eugénie Cotton and continued to discuss Pritt's report.

    The first to speak was Professor Petros Kokkalis (Greece). He cited many facts to show that after the United States turned Greece into its own military base, it now wants to turn it into a base for preparing for atomic war.

    Academician Lyudmil Stoyanov (Bulgaria) drew the meeting's attention to the various military plans of the aggressor forces in the Balkan Peninsula.

    Subsequently, Professor Friedrich, Chairman of the German Peace Committee, spoke, describing the achievements and tasks of the German movement for peace.

    Next, Dr. Kenjiro Yanagida (Japan) spoke, mentioning that a large-scale movement to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons was underway throughout Japan. Kenjiro Yanagida emphasized that this meeting of the World Peace Council should initiate a movement to ban atomic weapons among the solemn scientists and physicians from various countries.

    Then George Hanna spoke. He said that the people of the East are unwilling to tolerate the situation of slaves any longer. The people of Lebanon are unwilling to follow the policy of the United States, which seeks to enslave the people of Asia and other countries by new methods.

    Finnish representative Professor Felix Iversen spoke, suggesting that the World Peace Council meeting universally launch a propaganda campaign to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons and to ban the continued testing of such weapons.

    The participants listened with great attention to the speech of Austrian international law professor Brandweiner. Professor Brandweiner pointed out that the United States' explosion of a hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean has violated several basic principles of modern international law: it has violated the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas; violated the obligations it undertook to the residents of the Marshall Islands under its trusteeship, and endangered international security.

    Subsequently, Pelikan, Secretary-General of the International Student Union, spoke. He pointed out that the majority of students hope for peace and are willing to dedicate their entire lives to the creative activities of peace.

    The next speaker was Mustafa Amin (Syria), who introduced the efforts of the Syrian people to strive for national independence and to oppose dragging Syria into the various aggressive plans of reactionary forces.

    After Amin's speech, a letter from Erwes (West Germany), Chairman of the German League for Unity, Peace, and Freedom, who could not attend the World Peace Council's Berlin Special Session, was read.

    世界和平理事会柏林特别会议继续开会
    各国代表讨论普里特的报告
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十五日讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议二十四日下午会议上，到会代表们继续发言。
    日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎在发言中指出，美国爆炸氢弹的行为是违反普遍承认的关于公海航行自由的国际法原则的。他表示，日本人民相信和平运动的压力可以使得这种非人道的武器被禁止。平野义太郎说：我们已经开始为禁止原子武器和反对试验原子武器征集签名。争取禁止热核子武器的运动不仅是和平运动的一部分，而且是最重要的一部分。他代表日本人民建议世界和平理事会向五大国和其他国家呼吁禁止原子武器，并成立国际组织来监督禁令的实施。
    在世界和平理事会副主席利奥波德·英费尔德教授（波兰）和“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人萨希布·辛格·索克将军发言后，比利时和平联盟全国委员会主席、科学家马克斯·考森发言。他指出，在刚果开采的所有的铀都被美国用作军事用途了。他说，目前世界上的铀大部分都用于战争工业，必须把它们用在和平用途上。
    全印和平理事会秘书长钱德拉在会议上宣读了全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁博士的贺信。
    克其鲁在他的贺信中认为日内瓦会议的召开是和平力量的一个巨大胜利。他援引了尼赫鲁五月十五日的演说：“……对我们新近获得自由的亚洲国家来说，和平不仅是虔诚的希望，而且是紧急的必要。就某种意义来说，亚洲的命运在很大程度上决定于在印度支那或在朝鲜所发生的事情。”
    贺信说，战争的危险对于印度特别明显，美巴军事条约已把这种危险直接带到我们国家的边疆上来了。这是对亚洲和对世界和平不利的一个步骤。
    克其鲁在贺信中提出了印度和平战士的要求：
    首先要求应给予中华人民共和国以在联合国中的合法地位。
    其次、充分支持印度总理尼赫鲁所提出的关于印度支那问题的建议，以及印度政府所采取的禁止通过印度领土运输外国军队的立场。要求在印度支那立刻停火，并要求保证印度支那三个国家人民的充分自由以及保证外国不得干涉。
    第三、要求采取紧急措施来防止朝鲜战争再起，以及保证一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，以便朝鲜人民能自由地决定他们自己的命运。
    第四、要求目前派有代表在日内瓦出席会议的大国，保证亚洲各国人民能有自决和充分独立的权利，以作为在亚洲建立和平的基础。
    第五、反对任何目的在于剥夺亚洲各国的自由与独立的军事行为和联盟，并要求世界和平理事会宣布更坚决地抗议在非洲与其他地方实行的殖民主义与种族歧视的政策。
    克其鲁在贺信中最后着重谈到最近签订的中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定。他说，这一协定最重要的原则是：互相尊重领土完整，保证互不侵犯，互不干涉对方内政，平等互惠，和平共处。他希望和所有的邻国以及所有国家缔结类似的协定。
    会议在宣读完克其鲁博士的贺信后即告休会。
    据新华社讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议五月二十五日上午会议由欧仁妮·戈登担任主席，继续讨论普里特的报告。
    首先发言的为彼得罗斯·科卡利斯教授（希腊）。他引证了许多事实，说明美国在把希腊变为自己军事基地后，现在又想将它变为准备原子战争的基地。
    卢德米尔·斯托扬诺夫院士（保加利亚）提起会议注意侵略势力在巴尔干半岛的各种军事计划。
    随后发言的是德国和平委员会主席腓特烈教授，他叙述了德国争取和平运动的成就及其任务。
    接着柳田谦十郎博士（日本）发言，他谈到日本全国展开了一个争取禁止原子武器和氢武器的规模巨大的运动。柳田谦十郎着重指出，世界和平理事会这次会议应当在各国代表严正的科学的科学家和医师中，发起一个争取禁止原子武器的运动。
    接着乔治·汉纳发言。他说东方人民不愿再容忍奴隶的处境。黎巴嫩人民不愿追随美国那种寻求奴役亚洲和其他国家的人民的新方法的政策。
    芬兰代表费利克斯·伊维尔逊教授发言，他建议世界和平理事会会议普遍展开关于禁止使用原子武器和氢武器，禁止继续实验这种武器的宣传运动。
    参加会议者极其注意地倾听了奥地利国际法教授布兰德魏纳的发言。布兰德魏纳教授指出，美国在太平洋比基尼岛爆炸氢弹，因而破坏了现代国际法的若干基本原则：它破坏了公海的自由航行的原则；破坏了对在它托管下的马绍尔群岛居民所承担的义务，并使国际安全遭到威胁。
    随后，国际学生联合会总书记贝利康发言。他指出：大多数学生都希望和平，并愿意把自己整个生命贡献给和平的创造性的活动。
    接着发言的是穆斯塔法·阿明（叙利亚），他介绍了叙利亚人民努力争取民族独立和反对把叙利亚拖入反动势力的各种侵略计划之中的情形。
    阿明的发言后，宣读了不能到来参加世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟主席艾尔费斯（西德）的来信。
