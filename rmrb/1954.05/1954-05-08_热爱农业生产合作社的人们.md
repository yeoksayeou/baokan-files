	People Who Love Agricultural Production Cooperatives

	"I will always stay in the cooperative!"

	Wang Shulan is a female member of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heiyupao Village, Andong County, Liaodong Province. She and her fiancé, Zhang Zhiguo, agreed to get married in the autumn. After the news spread, the cooperative members stopped asking her to work and said to her: "We'll take care of the cooperative's affairs. You take care of your wedding preparations and do some work at home!"

	One day, when she picked up her needle, thread, and scissors to make new clothes, her mind wandered back to the cooperative's work. She thought about the carefree days she spent working with her sisters and the beautiful prospects of the cooperative: nurseries, libraries, and clubs would be established; she herself would be a tractor driver in the cooperative. Now that she was getting married, she would have to leave the cooperative and go to another village. Thinking of this, she couldn't calm down.

	She told the cooperative chairman her thoughts and asked him to consider letting her and her fiancé both join the cooperative. She said, "I will always stay in the cooperative!"

	The cooperative chairman did not agree to her request, saying, "Good girl, you are a person who loves the cooperative. When you go to another village, I hope you and Zhang Zhiguo will also mobilize the masses to organize agricultural production cooperatives."

	Works Harder Than Young Men

	In the Zhang Canting Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, Shandong Province, there is an old man named Deng Xuezeng who works harder than young men. When people mention him, the cooperative members give him a thumbs up and say, "Don't look at his age, he's a whiz when it comes to labor."

	Deng Xuezeng is responsible for the threshing ground and orchard in the cooperative. He often works with several assistants, threshing during the day and guarding the crops at night, protecting the newly harvested grain. Seeing the mountains of golden corn, soybeans, and millet, he thought: "We must not waste any of these delightful riches." When turning and drying the crops, he would sweep up any scattered grains on the edge of the threshing ground, and winnow them clean with a dustpan. During the harvest days, he often kept watch at the threshing ground. He said to people, "Looking at these piles of crops and thinking about these happy days, I don't want to sleep."

	"My work must be accelerated!"

	Chang Fengmin is the breeder of the Bizecun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District of Jiaohe County, Hebei Province. He is usually responsible for raising livestock and pigs. Since 1952, none of the fourteen animals he has raised have suffered from disease; and they have all grown fat and strong.

	He often says, "Livestock are like our own hands. Without them, we cannot cultivate the land. Raising livestock well is contributing to socialism." Over the years, he has taken great care of them, day and night. At night, as soon as he heard any noise in the livestock pen, he would jump up and go out to check.

	He also pays attention to improving breeding methods: feeding them regularly and quantitatively, and keeping the pigsty clean every day. When it's hot, he puts up cloth sheds outside the pigsty. When someone praises him, he always replies with a smile, "My work is far from perfect, and I must work harder!"

	"The death of a sheep is a loss for everyone!"

	Zhang Wenyu, the chairman of the Songshugou Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Sixth District of Yanqing County, Hebei Province, is fifty-eight years old this year. People respect him because he loves his cooperative so much.

	One day, when he was leading the cooperative members to weed the fields, the weather suddenly changed, and it started to rain. The cooperative members hurried to the "mountain shed" to take shelter from the rain, but he felt happy from the bottom of his heart and stayed in the field alone. He thought, "This is really good rain, it can fill out the corn seedlings in the field; now if I transplant one, it will surely live." He braved the rain and transplanted two hundred and thirty corn seedlings.

	Zhang Wenyu returned home from the field, not even having time to take off his wet clothes, when the shepherd ran over to report: "The cooperative's flock of sheep is being drenched to death in the Dabei Ravine!" At this time, he remembered that the cooperative's forty-three sheep had just been sheared three days ago, and if they were not well protected, they would be in danger of freezing to death. He quickly ran to the Dabei Ravine with the shepherd and saw three lambs already lying on the ground. They picked up the lambs, took them to Dalian Village, and covered them with heated burlap sacks. After they woke up, he breathed a sigh of relief and said, "The death of a sheep is a loss for everyone!"

	Improving the Technical Level of the Cooperative

	Hu Xuerong is the deputy director of the Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shehong County, Sichuan Province. Last winter, the county's labor model conference presented him with a new-style walking plow, but he didn't know how to use it, and the plow became a "hanging plow."

	In March of this year, the county transferred him to a training class to learn how to use the new-style walking plow. This made him very happy. As soon as he received the notice, he thought day and night: "I must study hard, and if I learn the skills well, I can improve the technical level of the entire cooperative."

	In his studies, he encountered many difficulties. For example, when listening to reports, he understood them in his heart, but he couldn't remember them; when it came to the technical parts, he sometimes couldn't fully understand them either. When encountering these situations, he suppressed his impatience and said to himself: "I can't be discouraged, my learning is not only for myself, but also for the entire cooperative to produce more grain and support national construction." After class and back in the dormitory, he often asked others for advice. At the end of the study, he proficiently mastered the use and installation techniques of new-style farm implements such as the new-style walking plow, the double-wheel single-share plow, and the double-wheel double-share plow.

	Now, the cooperative's new-style walking plow has already been put into the fields.

	Du Youyun Takes Good Care of the Livestock

	Du Youyun is the breeder of the Du Youzhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangqiu Prefecture, Henan Province. The livestock he raises have taut bellies and grow shiny and smooth.

	In the cold weather of the tenth and twelfth lunar months, the nights can be terribly cold. He often gets up from his warm bed to mix grass for the livestock, sometimes shivering from the cold. Someone asked him why he did this? He replied: "As the saying goes: horses don't get fat without eating night grass. If you seek personal comfort and don't feed them diligently at night, the livestock will become thin, which will not only cause losses to the cooperative, but also to the members."

	Once in the middle of the night, he saw a yellow horse choking, its tail swinging back and forth, refusing to eat grass. He knew something was wrong with the livestock. He remembered what the villagers had said: when livestock choke, you have to take them outside to walk them around. But at this time, snowflakes were flying outside, and the northwest wind was blowing. Regardless of the biting cold wind, he took the livestock out of the village for a stroll.

	He made a comb and regularly combs the livestock clean, not letting them grow a single louse.

### 热爱农业生产合作社的人们

    热爱农业生产合作社的人们
    “我永远要留在社里！”
    王淑兰是辽东省安东县黑鱼泡村前进农业生产合作社的女社员。她和她未婚夫张志国约好在秋后结婚。消息传出后，社员们都不叫她工作了，对她说：社里的事情我们来做，你办出门的事吧，在家干些活儿！
    有一天，她拿起针线、剪刀做新衣服时，心又转到社里活儿上去了。她又想到和姐妹们成天无忧无虑地劳动的情形，以及合作社的美丽远景：托儿所、图书馆、俱乐部成立起来了；她自己是社里的一个拖拉机手。现在，她要结婚了，就是说要离开合作社到外庄去了。想到这里，她的心再也安不下来了。
    她把自己的心思告诉了社长，请他核计一下，让她和她的未婚夫都到社里来。她说：“我永远要留在社里！”
    社长没有答应她的请求，对她说：“好姑娘，你是一个热爱合作社的人，到了外庄，希望你和张志国也发动群众，组织农业生产合作社。”
      干起活来赛过青年小伙子
    山东省泰安县上高乡张灿亭农业生产合作社里，有一个名叫邓学曾的老大爷，干起活来赛过青年小伙子。提起他，社员们都翘起大拇指说：“别看他年纪大，劳动起来可是顶呱呱。”
    邓学曾在社里负责场园的工作。他时常和几个助手白天打场、夜里看场，卫护着新收的粮食。他看到堆积如山的黄澄澄的玉米、大豆、谷子，心想：这些喜人的财富，决不让它有一点浪费。翻晒庄稼时，他见到场园边上有抛撒的谷粒，就用扫帚扫到一起，用簸箕扬干净。在收获的日子里，他经常在场园边看守着。他对人说：“瞧了这一垛垛的庄稼，想想这幸福的日子，不想睡觉了。”
    “我的工作还要加紧往前赶！”
    常凤敏是河北省交河县第五区毕泽村农业生产合作社的饲养员。他平时能负责地饲养牲口和猪子，从一九五二年以来，在他饲养的十四头牲口中没有发生过病瘟；并且都长得肥胖结实。
    他常常说：“牲口好比自己的一只手，没有它，就种不了地。养好牲口就是为社会主义出了一分力。”几年来，他常常不分白天黑夜，精心饲养它们。夜里，一听到牲口圈中有什么响声，他就一骨碌地爬起来，出去看看。
    他也注意改进饲养的方法：定时定量地喂，每天把猪圈打扫得干干净净的；逢到热天，在猪圈外边搭上布棚。有人夸奖时，他总是带着笑容回答：“我的工作差得远哩，还得加紧赶！”
    “死了羊是大伙的损失啊！”
    河北省延庆县六区松树沟农业生产合作社社长张文友，今年已五十八岁了。人们尊敬他，因为他那么热爱自己的合作社。
    有一天，他带着社员锄草时，天色突变，下起大雨来。社员们赶紧到“山窝棚”去避雨，而他却打心眼里感到高兴，独自留在地里。他想：“这真是好雨，地里的玉米苗可补齐了；现在移一棵，准能活一棵。”他冒着大雨，补种了二百三十棵玉米苗。
    张文友从地里收工回家，还没来得及脱去湿衣，看羊人跑来报告：“社里的羊群在大北沟快叫雨淋死啦！”这时，他想起社里的四十三只羊前三天才剪了毛，要是不能很好地保护它们，就有冻死的危险。他赶紧和看羊人跑到大北沟，瞧见三只羊羔已经躺倒在地上了。他们抱起小羊羔，把它们送到大梁西村，用烤热了的麻袋盖在羊羔身上；等它们苏醒过来以后，才松了一口气，说：“死了羊是大伙的损失啊！”
      提高合作社的技术水平
    胡学荣是四川省射洪县兴隆农业生产合作社的副社长。去年冬天，县劳动模范大会赠给他一架新式步犁，但他不懂得怎样使用，步犁就成了“挂犁”。
    今年三月间，县里调他到训练班，学习新式步犁的使用方法。这可把他乐坏了。他一得到通知，日夜想着：“我一定要努力学习，学好了本领就能使全社的技术水平提高一步。”
    在学习中，他碰到很多的困难。例如，听报告时，他心里挺明白，可是记不下来；讲到技术部分，有时也不能完全摸懂。碰到这些情况，他就按下自己的性子，对自己说：怎么也不能灰心，我学习不仅是为了自己，也为了全社多打粮食，支援国家建设。下课回宿舍以后，他常常向别人请教。学习结束时，他熟练地掌握了新式步犁、双轮一铧犁、双轮双铧犁等新式农具的使用法以及安装技术。
    现在，合作社的新式步犁已经下田了。
      杜有云的牲口照料得好
    杜有云是河南省商邱专区杜有忠农业生产合作社的饲养员。他喂养的牲口，肚皮绷得紧紧的，长得又光又滑。
    十冬腊月天气，晚上可真冷得要命。他常从暖烘烘的热被窝里爬起来，给牲口拌草，有时给冻得直打抖。有人问他为什么要这样作呢？他回答：“俗话说：马不吃夜草长不肥。若图个人舒服，夜里不给勤喂草，牲口就会瘦下来，这不仅会使合作社吃亏，社员也要受到损失。”
    有一次在半夜里他看到一匹黄马给噎住了，它尾巴摆过来摆过去，怎么也不肯吃草。他知道牲口出毛病了。他想起乡亲们的话：牲口吃噎了，就得把它拉到外面遛遛。可是这时外边正飘着雪花，刮着西北风。他不顾刺骨的寒风，拉着牲口到庄外去蹓躂。
    他做了个梳子，经常给牲口梳得干干净净的，不让长一个虱子。
