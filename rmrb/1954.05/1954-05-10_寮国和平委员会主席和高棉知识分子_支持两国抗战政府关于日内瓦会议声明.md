Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, Laos, May 8th: Mr. Sinkapo, Chairman of the Lao Committee for the Defense of World Peace, issued a statement supporting the May 5th statement of the Lao Resistance Government regarding the Geneva Conference. The statement said that for more than eight years, the Lao people, under the leadership of the Lao Resistance Government, have stood up and have been engaged in a heroic struggle against colonialist aggressors for independence, unification, peace, and democracy. During this period, the Lao people have established solid base areas in a long, arduous, but surely victorious struggle. Relying on the strong fortress of the alliance of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao peoples, and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Lao people have grown stronger and stronger, and they have liberated half of Lao territory and more than one million people. The Lao self-sufficient economy has developed and can guarantee a fairly adequate supply for the needs of the resistance. The Lao people are increasingly closely united around the Lao National United Front and the Lao Resistance Government led by Prime Minister Souphanouvong—a government that has withstood many tests in the patriotic struggle and enjoys the trust, support, and love of all the people.

Conversely, the puppet "government" headed by Sisavang Vong was initially a tool of the French colonialists, then became a pawn of the Japanese fascists from March 9, 1945, and then a tool of the French colonialist aggressors from August 1945. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the puppet government of Sisavang Vong cannot represent the Lao people's desire for genuine independence and peace.

Therefore, I believe that the Geneva Conference, in discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina, particularly in Laos, and any issues related to the Lao people, must have the participation of the true representatives of the Lao people, namely, the representatives of the Lao Resistance Government headed by Prime Minister Souphanouvong.

Therefore, I fully support the May 5th statement of the Lao Resistance Government regarding the Geneva Conference, because this statement not only conforms to the wishes of the Lao people, but also conforms to the wishes of peace-loving people in Asia and the world.
Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, May 8th: Khmer intellectuals warmly support the statement issued by the Khmer Resistance Government on May 3 regarding the Geneva Conference. Chas Mei, representing the intellectuals in the Khmer resistance forces, said: On behalf of the Khmer intellectuals in the resistance forces, I warmly welcome and support the May 3rd statement of the Khmer Resistance Government regarding the need for representatives of the Khmer Resistance Government to participate in the Geneva Conference in order to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.

Khmer intellectuals, together with other people, under the leadership of the Khmer Resistance Government and Chairman Son Ngoc Minh, have consistently and heroically resisted foreign aggression in the past few years, and have enabled the Khmer people to obtain various practical democratic rights. This explains why the Khmer Resistance Government has gained the trust of the people and is regarded by the masses as the only legitimate government.

At the same time, the puppet clique headed by Sihanouk has been acting as a running dog of the French and American imperialist aggressors, helping them to massacre the Khmer people. On the other hand, they are staging a farce of "independence" in an attempt to deceive the Khmer people. However, the Khmer people, who have seen through their conspiracy, have strengthened their unity, and they are more closely united around the Khmer Resistance Government than ever before, and are determined to fight for genuine independence, unification, peace, and democracy.

Khmer intellectuals, like other people, believe that the Sihanouk puppet clique cannot represent the Khmer people. Therefore, we believe that the Khmer Resistance Government's statement on the need to send an official delegation to participate in the Geneva Conference is reasonable. Only in this way can peace in Cambodia and Indochina be truly restored.

    寮国和平委员会主席和高棉知识分子
    支持两国抗战政府关于日内瓦会议声明
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社寮国八日讯：寮国保卫世界和平委员会主席辛卡波发表声明，支持寮国抗战政府五月五日发表的关于日内瓦会议的声明。声明说，八年多以来，寮国人民在寮国抗战政府的领导下站起来了，并一直在为了争取独立、统一、和平与民主，而与殖民主义侵略者进行着英勇的战斗。在这个时期内，寮国人民在长期的、艰苦的、但一定会获得胜利的战斗中，建立了巩固的根据地。寮国人民依靠着越南、高棉、寮国人民的联盟这样一个坚强的堡垒，并在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，力量日益壮大，他们已经解放了寮国国土的一半和约一百万以上的人口。寮国的自给自足经济有了发展，可以保证相当充分地供应抗战的需要。寮国人民日益紧密地团结在寮国自由民族统一战线和苏发努冯总理领导下的寮国抗战政府——在爱国斗争中经受了许多考验，得到全体人民的信任、支持和爱戴的政府——的周围。
    与此相反，以西萨望·汪为首的傀儡“政府”起初是法国殖民者的工具，从一九四五年三月九日起变做日本法西斯的走狗，从一九四五年八月起又成为法国殖民主义侵略者的走狗。因此，十分明显，西萨望·汪的傀儡政府不能代表寮国人民的要求真正独立与和平的愿望。
    因此，我认为，日内瓦会议在讨论恢复印度支那、特别是寮国的和平问题以及有关寮国人民的任何问题时，必须有寮国人民的真正代表、即以苏发努冯总理为首的寮国抗战政府的代表参加。
    因此，我完全支持寮国抗战政府五月五日发表的关于日内瓦会议的声明，因为这个声明不仅符合于寮国人民的愿望，而且符合于亚洲和世界各国爱好和平的人民的愿望。
   【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社高棉八日讯：高棉知识分子热烈拥护高棉抗战政府在五月三日发表的关于日内瓦会议的声明。查斯麦代表高棉抗战队伍中的知识分子发表谈话说：我代表抗战队伍中的高棉知识分子热烈欢迎并支持高棉抗战政府五月三日发表的关于应该有高棉抗战政府代表参加日内瓦会议、以在承认高棉、寮国和越南三国人民的民族权益的基础上讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的声明。
    高棉知识分子和其他人民一起，在高棉抗战政府和山玉明主席的领导下，在过去几年中，始终在英勇地抵抗外国侵略，并已使高棉人民获得了各项实际的民主权利。这说明了为什么高棉抗战政府获得了人民的信任。并被群众认为是唯一合法的政府。
    同时，以西哈努克为首的傀儡集团一直在充当法美帝国主义侵略者的走狗，帮助他们屠杀高棉人民。另一方面，他们扮演“独立”的丑剧，企图欺骗高棉人民。但是已经看穿了他们的阴谋的高棉人民加强了团结，他们比以往任何时候都更加紧密地团结在高棉抗战政府的周围，并决心为真正的独立、统一、和平和民主而斗争。
    高棉知识分子和其他人民一样，认为西哈努克傀儡集团不能代表高棉人民。因此，我们认为，高棉抗战政府关于必须派遣正式代表团参加日内瓦会议的声明是合理的。只有这样，才能真正地恢复高棉以及印度支那的和平。
