    State-owned Coal Mines Exceed April Plan
    Iron and Steel Industry Administration Exceeds Major Product Plan
   [This newspaper dispatch] National state-owned coal mines exceeded the April state production plan by 103.79 percent. The average daily output increased by 7.99 percent compared to the average daily output of the first quarter. Compared with the same period last year, the monthly output increased by 35.28 percent.
    Many units held technical conferences in April to specifically solve various related issues in production technology. In particular, the weakest link in coal mine production – production geological surveying – has begun to receive attention, providing a guarantee for doing a good job in tunneling. Employees in many units launched a technical innovation movement during labor competitions and achieved many results. For example, employees of the Datong Coal Mine put forward more than 30 important technical innovation proposals related to inventions of new tools and more than 100 rationalization proposals related to improving existing equipment and labor organization. After adjusting the labor organization and improving existing equipment, the No. 3 mine saved more than 80 laborers, who were transferred to coal mining areas lacking manpower, which increased coal production. In particular, the Ping'an No. 1 pit of the Fuxin Mining Bureau continued to achieve greater success in promoting regular cyclic operations in a one-meter coal seam. By April 29, the pit's output had exceeded the operation plan by 30 percent, the direct cost was reduced by 22 percent compared to the plan, and the equilibrium rate reached 99 percent. The success and consolidation of this pilot work shows that it is possible to achieve safe and regular cyclic operations under unfavorable objective conditions, and it also powerfully illustrates the superiority of Soviet advanced experience.
    [This newspaper dispatch] Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central Heavy Industry Department exceeded the production plan for five major products in April: iron ore at 102.5, metallurgical coke at 104.1, pig iron at 106, steel at 102.8, and steel products at 106.7.
    In April, enterprises under the administration continued to promote advanced experience and further exploited the potential of enterprises through improvements in equipment and technical operations, creating many new records. After implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts (furnace top regulation and ore grading into the furnace), the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant basically stabilized the furnace conditions, and the average daily output in April increased by 11.2 percent compared to March. After the converter workshop of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant improved and expanded equipment and strengthened the coordination of overhead cranes, the number of daily furnaces has increased from the past 89 furnaces (highest number) to 104 furnaces. The Daye Steel Plant further consolidated and improved the rapid steelmaking method of "low-silicon blowing," and production continued to rise, setting new daily smelting records, with a maximum of 128 furnaces, an increase of 18 furnaces compared to the highest daily smelting furnaces in March. The small rolling mill workshop of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant repeatedly set two new daily production records in rolling 12 mm round steel, an increase of 19.7 percent compared to the highest daily output in the past.

    国营煤矿超额完成四月份计划
    钢铁工业管理局主要产品计划超额完成
   【本报讯】全国国营煤矿以百分之一百零三点七九超额完成了四月份国家生产计划。平均日产量比第一季度平均日产量提高了百分之七点九九。与去年同期比较，全月产量提高百分之三十五点二八。
    不少单位在四月内召开了技术会议，具体解决了生产技术方面的各项有关问题。特别对煤矿生产中最薄弱的环节——生产地质测量问题，已初步重视起来，给做好掘进工作提供了保证。许多单位职工在劳动竞赛中掀起了技术革新运动，取得了不少成绩。如大同煤矿职工提出了三十多件有关创造发明新工具的重要技术革新建议和一百多条有关改进现有设备和劳动组织的合理化建议。三矿经过调整劳动组织和改进现有设备，就节省下劳力八十多人，调给缺人的采煤区，使煤产量增加。特别是阜新矿务局平安一坑在一公尺煤层中推行正规循环作业，继续取得更大的成绩。到四月二十九日，该坑产量已超过作业计划百分之三十，直接成本比计划降低了百分之二十二，均衡率达到百分之九十九。这一试点工作的成功与巩固，说明在客观条件不好的情况下，要做到安全、正规循环作业是可能的，同时也有力地说明苏联先进经验的优越性。
    【本报讯】中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业四月份超额完成了五种主要产品的生产计划：铁矿石为一○二·五，冶金焦一○四·一，生铁一○六，钢一○二·八，钢材一○六·七。
    该局所属企业，在四月份内继续推广了先进经验，并通过设备和技术操作上的改进，进一步发挥了企业的潜在力量，创造了不少新纪录。石景山钢铁厂贯彻苏联专家建议（炉顶调剂和矿石分级入炉）以后，使炉况基本稳定，四月份平均日产量比三月份提高了百分之一十一点二。上海钢铁公司第一厂转炉车间改进和扩充设备并加强天车的配合后，日炼炉数已由过去的八十九炉（最高数）提高到一百零四炉。大冶钢厂转炉进一步巩固和提高
  “低矽吹炼”的快速炼钢法，生产不断上升，连创日炼新纪录，最高达一百二十八炉，比三月份最高日炼炉数提高十八炉。太原钢铁厂小型轧钢车间在轧制十二公厘圆钢中连创两次日产新纪录，较过去最高日产量提高了百分之一十九点七。
