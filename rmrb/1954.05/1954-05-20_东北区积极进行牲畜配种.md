The Northeast region is currently in the peak season for livestock breeding. In most areas, farmers, under the promotion of agricultural producers' cooperatives, are actively carrying out breeding work in conjunction with field sowing. By mid-April, according to surveys in Changtu and Lishu counties, Liaoxi Province, 120 breeding stallions had already serviced 1,237 mares and 346 female donkeys. In Qingshan Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, the number of mares bred accounted for 30 percent of the total. Two districts in Changling County, Jilin Province, and Kaiyuan County, Liaoxi Province, also bred more than 230 mares. In some agricultural producers' cooperatives, all the mares have been bred. In Daxing Village, Changtu County, 75 out of 83 mares are confirmed pregnant, and all 100 cows have been successfully bred on the first attempt. (Northeast Agricultural Bureau)
