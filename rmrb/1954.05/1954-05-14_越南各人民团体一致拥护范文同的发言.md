Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, May 13th: Leaders of various mass organizations in Vietnam have issued statements, unanimously supporting the speech of Pham Van Dong, head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister, at the Geneva Conference, and supporting the just stance of the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China at the conference.

　　Vietnam General Confederation of Labor Chairman Hoang Quoc Viet issued a statement saying: "The head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, issued a statement at the Geneva Conference, stating that our government is actively striving to make the conference a success in order to restore peace in Indochina. In order to completely resolve the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong also suggested inviting representatives of the Cambodian and Lao Resistance Governments to attend the Geneva Conference. On behalf of all manual and intellectual workers in Vietnam, I warmly support Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's statement, because these words accurately reflect the common aspirations of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos." Hoang Quoc Viet said that at present, people all over the world regard the presence of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference as an important and favorable factor for restoring peace in Indochina. Anyone who respects facts and has peaceful sincerity cannot but admit that the fact that representatives of the Cambodian and Lao Resistance Governments have not been able to participate in the conference is a disadvantage for the restoration of peace in Indochina. The reason is simple: today, any discussion of issues related to the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos must inevitably encounter difficulties without the participation of the true people's representatives of the three countries. Hoang Quoc Viet then exposed the conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and French imperialist warmongers to continue and expand the Indochina War. Finally, he said: The people of Indochina, like all peace-loving people in the world, believe that the just stance upheld by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and for further easing international tensions, will surely defeat all the conspiracies of the war aggressors.

　　Tran Duc Thinh, Secretary General of the National Farmers' Liaison Committee of Vietnam, said in a statement: "Vietnamese farmers fully support the speech of the head of our delegation, Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, at the Geneva Conference, because this speech speaks the words in our hearts." Tran Duc Thinh said: "The Cambodian and Lao Resistance Governments, which have led the people of Cambodia and Laos to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people for eight years of heroic resistance, have no reason not to be able to send representatives to participate in the conference discussing the Indochina issue today."

　　Le Thi Xuyen, Chairman of the Vietnam Women's Union, indignantly accused the French invading army and American war-mongers of the disasters they have inflicted on the women of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. She said, "We warmly support the position of our representative Pham Van Dong, and we warmly support the statements of the representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. We demand that the Indochina War be stopped in a peaceful manner, based on the principles of respecting national freedom, independence, unity, and democracy. We believe that the representatives of the resisting peoples of Cambodia and Laos must participate in the conference to jointly discuss the fate of the mothers, wives, and their children and husbands in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos."

　　Nguyen Tuan, Secretary General of the Vietnam Federation of Literary and Art Associations, said in a statement: We warmly welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the cessation of the French and American imperialist aggression against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. We celebrate another important victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, and we celebrate the participation of the representatives of the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference. Today, everyone has to admit the fact that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, any international issue, especially Asian issues, can absolutely not be resolved. Nguyen Tuan talked about the fact that the representatives of the Cambodian and Lao Resistance Governments have not yet been able to participate in the Geneva Conference, pointing out that it is unreasonable to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina without the participation of the representatives of the Cambodian and Lao Resistance Governments.

    越南各人民团体一致拥护范文同的发言
    【新华社北越十三日电】越南各群众团体负责人纷纷发表声明，一致拥护越南民主共和国代表团首席代表、副总理兼代理外交部长范文同在日内瓦会议上的发言，并拥护苏联和中华人民共和国代表团在会议上的严正立场。
    越南总工会主席黄国越发表声明说：“越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同副总理在日内瓦会议上发表声明，表示我国政府正积极努力促使会议有所成就，以便恢复印度支那的和平。为了完满解决恢复印度支那和平问题，范文同副总理并建议邀请高棉、寮国抗战政府代表出席日内瓦会议。我谨代表越南全体体力和脑力劳动者热烈拥护范文同副总理的声明，因为这些话正确地反映了越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的共同愿望。”黄国越说，目前，全世界人民都把越南民主共和国代表团出席日内瓦会议，看成是恢复印度支那和平的重要有利因素。任何尊重事实并具有和平诚意的人都不能不承认：高棉和寮国抗战政府的代表没有能够参与会议，对于恢复印度支那的和平是一件不利的事情。理由很简单：今天讨论任何与越南、高棉和寮国三国人民有关的问题，如果没有三个国家的真正的人民代表参加，那么这些问题的讨论就必然要遭到困难。黄国越接着揭露了美帝国主义和法帝国主义好战分子企图继续并扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。最后他说：印度支那人民和全世界爱好和平人民一样，相信苏联和中华人民共和国为和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平、进一步缓和国际紧张局势所坚持的严正立场，必将战胜战争侵略者的一切阴谋。
    越南全国农民联络委员会总书记陈德盛在声明中说：“越南农民完全拥护我国代表团首席代表范文同副总理在日内瓦会议上的发言，因为这个发言说出了我们心里的话。”陈德盛说：“领导着高棉和寮国人民与越南人民在一起并肩进行了八年英勇抗战的高棉和寮国抗战政府，今天不能够派代表参加讨论印度支那问题的会议，是没有理由的。”
    越南妇女联合会主席黎氏钏愤慨地控诉法国侵略军和美国战争贩子所加于越南、高棉和寮国妇女们身上的灾害，她说：“我们热烈拥护我们的代表范文同的立场，我们热烈拥护苏联和中华人民共和国代表的声明。我们要求以和平的方式，在尊重民族自由、独立、统一和民主的原则上停止印度支那战争。我们认为抗战的高棉、寮国人民的代表必须参加会议，来共同商讨越南、高棉和寮国的母亲、妻子以及她们的子弟、丈夫们的命运问题。”
    越南文学艺术联合会总书记阮遵在声明中说：我们热烈欢迎讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和停止法美帝国主义侵略越南、高棉和寮国的战争的日内瓦会议的召开。我们庆祝苏联和平政策又一次重要的胜利，我们庆祝中华人民共和国代表参加日内瓦会议。今天任何人都不得不承认这样的一个事实：如果没有中华人民共和国参加，任何国际问题尤其是亚洲问题是绝对不可能解决的。阮遵谈到高棉和寮国抗战政府代表至今还未能参加日内瓦会议，指出要讨论恢复印度支那和平问题，而没有高棉和寮国抗战政府的代表参加，是不合情理的。
