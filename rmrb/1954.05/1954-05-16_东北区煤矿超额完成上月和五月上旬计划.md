Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 15th: State-owned coal mines in Northeast China completed the state coal production plan for April, producing an additional 200,000 tons of coal. The cumulative overproduction of coal from January to April has reached nearly 600,000 tons. In early May, the output of state-owned coal mines exceeded the ten-day plan by 3.3 percent. In particular, the overfulfillment of the coking coal production plan ensured the iron smelting needs of state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and others. The total footage of tunneling in April also exceeded the plan by 10.1 percent.

The active introduction of rationalization proposals and the promotion of advanced experience by coal mine workers in labor competitions are important guarantees for overfulfilling state plans. Workers at the Xinqiu Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau proposed 203 rationalization proposals in the competition, such as setting up temporary sedimentation chambers in the pits, which enabled the mine to overfulfill its April plan by 23.6 percent. The Xingshan, Dongshan, and Nanshan mines of the Hegang Mining Bureau promoted advanced coal mining and tunneling experience in the competition, enabling the bureau to complete its April plan three days ahead of schedule. In the labor competitions, various coal mines also strengthened technical management and implemented operating procedures. The Fuxin Mining Bureau combined the labor competition with the conscientious implementation of operating procedures and the promotion of the experience of the Ping'an Mine's No. 1 pit one-meter layer pilot site, enabling the bureau's 24 coal mining faces to achieve an actual cycle of 351 in April, thereby ensuring that the bureau's underground coal production exceeded the plan by 21 percent. The Fuguo No. 2 pit of the Xi'an Mining Bureau strictly implemented the operating procedures for different types of work and different areas in April, and the raw coal output completed the April plan nine days ahead of schedule, producing an additional 609 tons of coal for the state.

    东北区煤矿超额完成上月和五月上旬计划
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北区各国营煤矿四月份完成了国家产煤计划，又多生产了煤炭二十万吨。从一月到四月超额生产的煤炭累计已近六十万吨。五月上旬各国营煤矿的产量又超过旬计划百分之三点三。特别是炼焦煤产量计划的超额完成，保证了国营鞍山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司等的炼铁的需用。四月份掘进总公尺数也超过计划百分之一十点一。
    各煤矿职工在劳动竞赛中积极提出合理化建议和推广先进经验，是超额完成国家计划的重要保证。阜新矿务局新邱矿职工，在竞赛中提出在坑内设临时沉淀仓等二百零三件合理化建议，因而使全矿四月份的计划超额完成百分之二十三点六。鹤岗矿务局兴山、东山和南山三个矿，在竞赛中推广了先进的采煤经验和掘进经验，使全局提前三天完成了四月份计划。各煤矿在劳动竞赛中，并加强技术管理，贯彻了作业规程。阜新矿务局结合劳动竞赛，认真贯彻了作业规程和推广了平安矿一坑一公尺层试点场子的经验，使全局二十四个采煤场子在四月份的实际循环达到三百五十一个，因而保证了全局坑下产煤超过计划百分之二十一。西安矿务局富国二坑，四月份严格执行了分工种分区域的作业规程后，原煤产量就提前九天完成了四月份计划，还多为国家生产了六百零九吨煤炭。
