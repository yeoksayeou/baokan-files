Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 28th: The Northwest Administrative Committee's Commercial Bureau held a Northwest Region National Trade Work Conference from May 5th to 20th. Trade work cadres from eight ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Uzbek, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Han, attended the conference. Representatives from the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government and relevant units in the Northwest Region also participated.

    The conference summarized the national trade work in the Northwest Region in 1953 and, based on the general task of the country's transition period and the economic characteristics of the ethnic minority areas in the Northwest, determined that in 1954, the ethnic minority areas in the Northwest should continue to consolidate and steadily develop the state-owned commercial front and further promote material exchange. All trade organizations must adopt various effective measures according to the state's economic plan to reasonably organize the supply of goods needed by the people of ethnic minorities, and supply various special items as much as possible according to the characteristics of each ethnic group, especially to strengthen the supply of means of production to help farmers and herdsmen develop production; in key areas, specialized trade organizations should be developed, and mobile trade groups should continue to be organized to go deep into pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas to carry out trade work.

    The conference believed that with the development of national economic construction and agricultural and animal husbandry production in ethnic minority areas, the national trade work in the Northwest Region in 1953 has made great progress. There are a total of 417 state-owned trade organizations in these areas. State-owned trade companies in various places have also organized 421 mobile trade groups to go deep into grasslands and remote mountainous areas to carry out trade work. Last year, state-owned trade departments in various places not only supplied a large amount of means of production and means of livelihood to the people of various ethnic minorities, but also vigorously purchased agricultural and animal husbandry products and local and special products. For example, the Linxia Trade Branch Company of Gansu Province operated 127 kinds of local and special products last year, an increase of 45 percent compared with 1952. The total purchase and sales value of state-owned trade in various ethnic minority areas has also increased greatly. For example, in Xinjiang Province last year, the total value of the supply of means of production and means of livelihood increased by 109.68 percent compared with 1952, and the total purchase value increased by 73.99 percent compared with 1952. At the same time, state-owned trade organizations in various places also supported the development of production by handicraftsmen in ethnic minority areas and held many small-scale material exchange fairs, which enlivened the material exchange in ethnic minority areas.

    西北区召开民族贸易工作会议
    确定继续稳步发展国营商业促进物资交流
   【新华社西安二十八日电】西北行政委员会商业局五月五日到二十日召开了西北区民族贸易工作会议。出席会议的有维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔、乌兹别克、蒙古、藏、回、汉等八个民族的贸易工作干部。中央人民政府商业部和西北区有关单位也派代表参加了会议。
    会议总结了一九五三年西北区民族贸易工作，并根据国家过渡时期的总任务和西北民族地区的经济特点，确定一九五四年内，西北各民族地区要继续巩固和稳步发展国营商业阵地，进一步促进物资交流。各贸易机构必须对少数民族人民需要的用品，按国家的经济计划采取各种有效办法合理地组织供应，并尽可能地依照各民族的特点，供应各种特殊用品，特别要加强生产资料的供应，帮助农牧民发展生产；在重点地区，应发展专业贸易机构，继续组织流动贸易组深入牧区、半农半牧区开展贸易工作。
    会议认为：随着国家经济建设和民族地区农牧业生产的发展，一九五三年西北地区的民族贸易工作有了很大的开展。这些地区的国营贸易机构共有四百一十七个。各地国营贸易公司并组织了四百二十一个流动贸易组，深入草原和边远山区开展贸易工作。去年各地国营贸易部门除供应给各少数民族人民大量的生产资料和生活资料外，还大力收购农牧业产品和土产特产产品。如甘肃省临夏贸易支公司去年经营的土、特产品就有一百二十七种，较一九五二年增加了百分之四十五。各民族地区国营贸易的购销总值也大大增加。如新疆省去年供应生产资料和生活资料的总值比一九五二年增加百分之一百零九点六八，收购总值较一九五二年增加百分之七十三点九九。同时，各地国营贸易机构还扶助少数民族地区手工业者发展生产，并举办了许多小型物资交流会，活跃了民族地区的物资交流。
