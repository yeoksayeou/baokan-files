    [By our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch of the 16th] The flood drainage projects on the Xiangyu River and Wuma River in Shanxi Province have been largely completed. Two thousand mu of alkaline wasteland and forty thousand mu of soil that has begun to alkalize along the river can be improved, and the drainage problem of two hundred and fifty thousand mu of land can be completely solved. This directly guarantees the increase in agricultural production in the area along the river this year. The Xiangyu and Wuma Rivers run through Yuci, Taigu and other counties in the Yuci Special District. For many years, these two rivers have breached their banks and burst their dikes during the rainy season, flooding roads and crops, resulting in reduced harvests year after year. In particular, the overflow of floodwaters raised the groundwater level in the Fenhe Minsheng and other irrigation areas, causing the farmland in this area to become alkaline year by year. By the autumn of 1953, the land that was completely alkalized had reached 20,000 mu, and the land that had begun to alkalize had reached 40,000 mu. In particular, the long-term inability to drain floodwaters after the dikes breached has caused the annual reduction in production of 250,000 mu of fertile land in the Fenhe Minsheng and other irrigation areas. Therefore, the lives of hundreds of thousands of farmers in the area have been seriously affected.
    In order to ensure the bumper harvest of crops in the Xiangyu and Wuma River basins and to ensure the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, the staff of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Yuci Special Office began to conduct surveys, measurements and design projects last winter. This spring, the Provincial People's Government allocated more than 4 billion yuan to purchase equipment, and organized the Xiangyu River and Wuma River Management Committee, composed of workers and cadres. In addition to planned guidance in various projects, the local Party and government organs were organized to mobilize more than 12,000 laborers from Yuci, Taigu and other counties to participate in earthwork projects. According to the entire repair project, in addition to the construction of 69 large and small projects such as drop structures, bridges, flood discharge slopes, culverts and sluice gates, the earthwork alone reached 634,582.5 cubic meters. Since construction started on March 29, more than 12,000 laborers along the river have actively participated in the labor under the condition of ensuring both river management and production. By April 15, all four flood discharge canals with a total length of about 116 li had been completed. All earthwork projects have been completed. Since April 15, all projects have been turned to the construction of drop structures, bridges, flood discharge slopes, culverts, sluice gates and other projects. It is expected that all projects will be completed by the end of May or early June.

    山西省象峪河和乌马河退水工程大部竣工
    【本报太原十六日电】山西省象峪河、乌马河的退水工程已大部竣工。沿河两万亩碱荒和四万亩已开始碱化的土壤可以得到改良，并可彻底解决二十五万亩土地的排水问题。这对沿河一带地区今年的农业增产，直接起了保证作用。象峪、乌马二河贯穿在榆次专区的榆次、太谷等县。多年来，每当雨季，这两条河即溃堤决口，淹没道路和庄稼，使农作物年年减收，尤其是洪水外溢漫流的结果，抬高了汾河民生等灌溉区的地下水位，就使这一带农田逐年碱化起来。到一九五三年秋后，完全碱化的土地已达两万亩，开始碱化的土地即达四万亩。特别是溃堤后洪水长时期无法排出，使汾河民生等灌溉区的二十五万亩良田常年减产。因此，当地数十万农民群众的生活受到严重的影响。
    为保障象峪、乌马两河流域的农作物丰收，保障数十万人民的生活，山西省人民政府水利局和榆次专署水利局的工作人员，在去年冬季即开始进行勘查测量设计工程。今春省人民政府又拨款四十余亿元采购器材，并组织由工人、干部参加组成的象峪河、乌马河治理委员会。除有计划地指导进行各项工程外，并通过地方党政机关有组织地发动榆次、太谷等县一万二千多民工参加做土方工程。按整个修治工程，除修筑跌水桥梁、退水坡、涵洞斗门等六十九件大小工程外，单土方工程即达六十三万四千五百八十二点五公方。从三月二十九日开工，沿河群众在治河生产两不误的条件下有一万二千多名民工积极地参加了劳动，到四月十五日止，即将四条长约一百一十六华里的退水渠全部完成。土方工程全部竣工。从四月十五日起全部工程即转向修筑跌水桥梁、退水坡、涵洞、斗门等工程。预计五月底六月初全部工程即可竣工。
