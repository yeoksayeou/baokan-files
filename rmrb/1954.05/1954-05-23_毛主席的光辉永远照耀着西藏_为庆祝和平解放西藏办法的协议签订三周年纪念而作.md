    Mao Zedong's radiance will forever illuminate Tibet
    -- Written in celebration of the third Anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for Peaceful Liberation of Tibet
    Dalai Lama

    Today is the third anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. With joyful and excited feelings, I, on behalf of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, warmly celebrate this day of great historical significance.

    In the three years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet has correctly implemented the ethnic policies and freedom of religious belief policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, faithfully implemented the agreement, and united with the vast number of Tibetan monks and laypeople to work hard to consolidate national defense. Under the shining of Chairman Mao’s policies, the patriotic forces of the Tibetan people have been continuously growing, and the unity with the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland has been gradually strengthened, first of all, the unity between the Han and Tibetan brothers, which has been strengthened and consolidated day by day in the past three years. Similarly, the Tibetan ethnic group has also united internally. Panchen Erdeni has already returned to Tibet. Some internal problems left over for many years have been basically resolved step by step through consultation. The situation of division and disunity caused by imperialism and reactionary governments of the past no longer exists. In the future, we must strengthen our efforts and work together to develop the cause of Tibetan construction.

    In order to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, the great leader of our various ethnic groups, and to learn from and observe the great construction of various parts of the motherland, since 1952, the local government of Tibet has successively sent tribute delegations, youth and Buddhist visiting groups, and National Day observation delegations to pay tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao and visit various parts of the motherland. It also established an office in Beijing, sent students to the mainland to study, and sent representatives to attend various meetings such as the membership representative conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Through these activities, the relationship with the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland has become closer, and at the same time, the close relationship between the central government and the local government of Tibet has been strengthened.

    The People's Liberation Army entering Tibet has helped the Tibetan people in doing many things beneficial to the Tibetan people under possible conditions. The Tibetan people love their own army of the people of all ethnic groups and have actively carried out the work of supporting the People's Liberation Army. At present, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet is actively building the Kangzang Highway. Tibetan monks and laypeople in 58 Zong and Xika near the highway have organized many laborers to participate in the road construction and dispatched a large number of livestock to support transportation. In order to better consolidate national defense and gradually improve the economic and cultural life of the Tibetan people, the Tibetan monks and laypeople are doing everything they can to support and cooperate, and strive to complete the Kangzang Highway, which is closely related to the future development of Tibetan construction, as soon as possible.

    With the rapid development of the motherland's economic construction, it has brought the Tibetan people the desire to build a happy life. We will, on the basis of the existing unity and various achievements, under the leadership and help of the Central People's Government, steadily develop the construction cause of Tibet.

    China and India signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India" on April 29, and exchanged notes at the same time. This is in line with the common interests and traditional friendship of the people of China and India, and also in line with the actual life needs of the Tibetan people. Here, it proves once again the correctness of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The local government of Tibet and the Tibetan people sincerely support this agreement and will work together with the people of the whole country to implement this agreement.

    Mao Zedong's radiance will forever illuminate Tibet. The Tibetan people have a firm confidence in creating their own happy future. We will advance together with the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland, gradually and thoroughly implement the agreement, develop the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Tibetan people, and strive together for the economic construction of the great motherland.

    Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in China!

    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups!

    毛主席的光辉永远照耀着西藏
    ——为庆祝和平解放西藏办法的协议签订三周年纪念而作
    达赖喇嘛
    今天是和平解放西藏办法的协议签订的三周年纪念日。我以愉快兴奋的心情并代表西藏僧俗人民热烈地庆贺这个具有伟大历史意义的日子。
    西藏和平解放三年以来，入藏人民解放军正确地执行了中国共产党、毛主席的民族政策、信教自由政策，忠实地执行协议，并和西藏广大僧俗人民团结在一起，为巩固祖国国防而努力。在毛主席政策的光辉照耀下，西藏人民的爱国主义力量不断增长，逐渐地加强了和祖国各兄弟民族的团结，首先是汉、藏兄弟民族的团结，三年来是一天比一天地更加加强和巩固。同样，西藏民族内部也团结起来了，班禅额尔德尼已经回到了西藏。多少年来遗留下来的一些内部问题，通过协商基本上已逐步得到解决，过去帝国主义和历代反动政府所造成的分裂和不团结的情况已不再存在了，今后要更加加强努力，共同为发展西藏建设的事业而奋斗。
    为了向我们各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席致敬，为了向祖国各兄弟民族学习和观摩祖国各地的伟大建设，从一九五二年以来，西藏地方先后派遣了致敬团、青年和佛教参观团、国庆节观礼团向伟大领袖毛主席致敬和到祖国各地参观，并成立了驻京办事处，派遣学员到内地学习和派遣代表出席中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会等各种会议。通过这些活动，和祖国各兄弟民族的关系日趋密切，同时也加强了中央和西藏地方的密切关系。
    进藏人民解放军在可能的条件下，帮助西藏人民作了很多有益于西藏人民的事情。西藏人民热爱各族人民自己的军队，积极地进行了支援人民解放军的工作。目前，进藏人民解放军正在积极修筑康藏公路，西藏僧俗人民在邻近公路沿线的五十八个宗和溪卡组织了许多民工参加了修路工作，出动了大批的牲畜来支援运输。为了更好地巩固祖国国防和逐步提高西藏人民的经济、文化生活，西藏僧俗人民正尽一切力量支援和配合，争取早日修通这条和未来发展西藏建设事业息息相关的康藏公路。
    随着祖国经济建设的飞跃发展，给西藏人民带来了建设幸福生活的热望，我们将在现有的团结和各种成就的基础上，在中央人民政府的领导和帮助下，稳步地发展西藏的建设事业。
    中、印两国于四月二十九日签订了“中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定”，同时互换了照会。这是符合中、印两国人民共同利益和传统友谊的，也是符合于西藏民族的实际生活需要的。在这里并再一次的证明了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的正确性。西藏地方政府和西藏人民热诚地拥护这一协定，并将和全国人民一道共同努力于此项协定的执行。
    毛主席的光辉永远照耀着西藏，西藏人民对创造自己幸福的前途具有坚强的信心，我们要和祖国各兄弟民族一道，共同迈进，逐步地彻底实现协议，发展西藏民族的政治、经济和文化，为伟大祖国的经济建设事业共同奋斗。
    中国各民族人民大团结万岁！
    各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
