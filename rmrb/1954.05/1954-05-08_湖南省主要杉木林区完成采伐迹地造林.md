The afforestation work in the felled areas of major fir timber regions in Hunan Province has been fully completed. Farmers in the five fir timber regions of Huitong, Yuanling, Jianghua, Ningyuan, and Dongkou have replanted fir trees on more than 56,000 mu of felled mountains. Twenty-five years later, these newly planted fir seedlings will become a large amount of construction timber.

In order to do a good job in this afforestation of felled areas, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau and relevant special districts and counties organized six forest area work teams in December of last year to go to various forest areas to help prepare for the afforestation of felled areas. Under the leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Government, the Jianghua Forest Area Work Team, combined with the central work, conducted a survey of the felled areas, formulated an afforestation plan, carried out various typical experiments, and then led the forest farmers to clear the land and reclaim the mountains before afforestation.

The characteristic of this year's afforestation work is that many forest farmers have been organized to manage forestry. Seventy-five percent of the masses involved in afforestation in the Yuanling Forest Area have been organized. Due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the forest area, the efficiency and quality of this year's afforestation have been improved. In Yanzhai Township, Huitong Forest Area, individual farmers could only plant nine trees per work day (including land clearing and mountain reclamation), while the local Tang Dingguo mutual aid group could plant fifteen trees per work day under the same circumstances. Liang Yuanjing, a farmer in the Huitong Forest Area, had a piece of forest land that had been felled for six years and had not been planted with trees until he joined the mutual aid group.

During this year's afforestation, the forest farmers in Ningyuan Forest Area summarized the local afforestation experience and implemented the "Fir Cutting Afforestation Method." After the promotion of this method, 80% of the local mountain land implemented cutting afforestation. The Yao ethnic forest farmers in Jianghua Forest Area changed the past habit of afforestation two or three years after felling, and implemented immediate afforestation on the newly felled land, so as to cultivate more and better timber for the country more quickly.

### 湖南省主要杉木林区完成采伐迹地造林

    湖南省主要杉木林区完成采伐迹地造林
    湖南省主要杉木林区的采伐迹地造林工作，已经全部完成。会同、沅陵、江华、宁远、洞口五个杉木林区的农民们在五万六千多亩已经采伐过的山上又栽上了杉树。二十五年之后，这些新种上的杉树幼苗就会变成大量建设用材。
    为了做好这一次迹地造林工作，湖南省林业局和有关的专区和县就曾在去年十二月间组织了六个林区工作队，分头到各个林区去帮助进行采伐迹地造林的准备工作。江华林区工作队在当地党委和人民政府的领导下，结合中心工作，进行了采伐迹地的调查，订出了造林计划，做了各种典型试验，然后领导林农清理迹地、垦山，再进行造林。
    今年迹地造林工作的特点是许多林农都已组织起来经营林业。沅陵林区造林的群众中有百分之七十五已经组织起来。由于林区发展了互助合作运动，提高了今年迹地造林的效率和质量。会同林区岩寨乡的单干农民，每个工只能栽植九株（包括清理迹地和垦山等项工夫），而当地的唐定国互助组，在同样情形下，每个工可以栽十五株。会同林区农民梁源镜有一块采伐了六年的林地，一直没有种上树，参加互助组以后才把树栽上。
    今年迹地造林时，宁远林区的林农们总结了当地造林的经验，实行“杉木插条造林法”。这个方法推广以后，当地百分之八十的山地都实行了插条造林。江华林区的瑶族林农改变了过去采伐以后两三年才造林的习惯，实行在刚采伐过的新土上马上造林，较快地为国家培育出更多更好的木材。
