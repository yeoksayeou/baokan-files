    The Vietnamese Working Class Struggles for National Independence and World Peace
    Pei Hongming, Member of the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor
    The heroic resistance war waged by the Vietnamese people against aggression and for independence and peace has been going on for eight years.
    On battlefields across the country, the Vietnam People's Army has continuously launched large-scale battles and achieved significant victories. At the same time, the land reform movement has begun throughout Vietnam and has achieved great success. The peasants who have been allocated land are restoring and developing agricultural production with high labor enthusiasm.
    In order to meet the urgent needs of the front lines and rural areas, the tasks undertaken by the Vietnamese working class are becoming increasingly arduous.
    Eighty years of oppression and bondage by colonialists and feudal forces have made Vietnam's industrial and agricultural production extremely backward and the people's lives extremely painful. However, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese working class, united with the patriotic people of all strata, has displayed tremendous initiative and combativeness on the two fronts against imperialism and feudalism, constantly strengthening and consolidating the people's democratic regime, restoring the national economy, and pushing the resistance war towards victory.
    In factories, on highways, in laboratories, and in government offices, Vietnamese workers have launched a vigorous competition movement, displaying a selfless work ethic to ensure the completion of production plans that fully supply the front lines and meet the needs of the people.
    In the past year, workers in the national defense production sector have achieved many accomplishments. The entire working masses have been involved in the vigorous movement of "guaranteeing quality, increasing productivity, and supporting the front lines in a timely manner."
    Factory guard model Fan Wencao, under the frantic bombing and strafing of enemy planes, bravely stayed at his post, not leaving the engine. He thought, "If I run away, the steam in the boiler will increase and explode, exposing the factory's target, and if the boiler breaks, production cannot be guaranteed." Therefore, he stayed around the boiler, adding water and trying to prevent the smoke from rising. When the enemy planes bombed and broke the chimney's cable, he climbed up the chimney to cover it. When enemy planes strafed, he hid, and when they flew away, he came out to work. In this way, when the workers returned after the enemy planes left, the machines immediately started running again, ensuring uninterrupted production.
    In the Fifth Interzone in Central and Southern Vietnam, the output of the ordnance department workers in the first half of 1953 was equal to the production volume of the entire year of 1952. The total number of weapons produced in the two months at the end of 1952 was equal to the total production volume of the first half of 1952, and the quality of the products was guaranteed.
    With the ever-increasing needs of the front lines, the work of supplying the front is very important. However, enemy planes are intensifying the destruction of highways and strafing transportation vehicles day by day. The more intense the fighting of the Vietnam People's Army on the front lines, the more bravely the transportation workers fight on the highway and bridge front. They overcame all difficulties, eliminated the obstacles created by the enemy, and completed the task of supplying the front lines in a timely manner.
    The enemy used various weapons such as heavy bombs, napalm bombs, parachute bombs, time bombs, airburst bombs, etc., in an attempt to cut off or destroy the supply lines to the front. But the enemy can never weaken the bravery and determination of the bridge workers, nor can it stop the tens of thousands of civilian workers who protect and repair the roads. Huang Tingzhuo, a hero youth league member who checked time bombs, disregarded the danger during enemy bombing, mobilized his comrades to cover themselves with mud so that enemy planes could not detect them, and then rushed to the highway to dig out two of the enemy's time bombs. After research, he finally created a method to destroy the enemy's bomb function. In this way, our heroic road maintenance workers not only protected the safety of the transportation lines, but also used the gunpowder from the enemy's bombs to break stones and build roads.
    The transport workers have achieved brilliant results. A motorcade of a transportation company increased its transport volume by 5 percent and saved 9 percent of the gasoline consumption quota. Despite the enemy's non-stop strafing day and night, they were still able to ensure the completion of the task. The motorcade was honored to receive President Ho Chi Minh's flag. The spirit of struggle of the broad masses of the people, who are not afraid of hardship and overcome difficulties, and their great efforts, have ensured the timely and adequate supply to the front-line troops.
    Meeting the growing needs of the front lines is an important task for workers in all production sectors. At the same time, increasing production to meet the people's needs for necessities is also very urgent. In particular, after mobilizing the peasant masses to thoroughly implement rent reduction and land reform, the peasants' need for material and cultural goods has greatly increased compared to before. Therefore, the workers actively improve technology, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs to meet the needs of the expanding market, and fully create the strength to conduct economic struggles against the enemy. The "increase products, reduce costs" movement launched by state-owned enterprises has achieved many results. Due to improved quality and reduced costs, enterprises have accumulated a large amount of funds for the state in the past year.
    The national paper industry is developing rapidly. In the Fourth Interzone alone, the output in 1953 increased by 16 percent compared to 1952, and the cost was reduced by an average of 20 to 30 percent. The Huang Wenshu Factory's annual output exceeded the plan by 9.8 percent, the reject rate dropped from 7 percent to 1.7 percent, and the cost was reduced by 18 percent; the price of paper was reduced twice, and the quality of the products was better than before. Other production sectors such as textiles, sugar, and soap have also developed. Particularly noteworthy is the agricultural tool production sector, which has supplied sufficient agricultural tools to the mobilized peasant masses and the peasants in the newly liberated areas. Last year, workers in the agricultural tool sector made many creations in order to produce better agricultural tools for the peasants, and the cost was reduced by an average of 15 to 30 percent. The workers also formed many groups to go to the countryside to repair waterwheels, and to teach the methods of manufacturing and using various waterwheels, and to study and implement water absorption irrigation work together with the peasants. The Vietnamese worker-peasant alliance is becoming increasingly consolidated.
    In the eight years of struggle against the French aggressors and American interventionists, the Vietnamese working class has continuously promoted the spirit of self-reliance, overcoming various difficulties, and contributing great strength to the great national resistance war, in accordance with President Ho Chi Minh's teachings.
    The Vietnamese working class ardently hopes to achieve peace in its own land so as to devote itself to building a happy life like that of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries.
    The active support of the working class and people all over the world in the movement to demand the cessation of the war of aggression against Vietnam and the restoration of peace in Indochina has further inspired the Vietnamese working class and people to strengthen their confidence in victory.
    The Vietnamese working class warmly welcomes the Geneva Conference, which is being held to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina in order to ease international tensions. The Vietnamese working class, together with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, strengthens its unity with the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthens the unity of the people of all strata in the country, especially the close alliance of workers and peasants, strives to develop production, strengthens combat, and smashes the conspiracies of the American and French warmongers to continue and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    越南工人阶级为民族独立与世界和平而斗争
    越南总工会中央执行委员会委员　裴洪明
    越南人民为反对侵略、争取独立与和平而进行的英勇抗战，已经八年了。
    在全国各个战场上，越南人民军不断展开了大规模的战斗，并取得了重大的胜利。同时，越南全国的土地改革运动已经开始，并已取得很大成就，分到土地的农民正在以高度的劳动热忱恢复和发展农业生产。
    为了满足前线和农村的迫切需要，越南工人阶级担负的任务越来越繁重了。
    八十年来殖民者和封建势力的压迫和束缚，使得越南工农业生产极为落后，人民生活极为痛苦。但是越南工人阶级在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的领导下，团结各阶层爱国人民，在反对帝国主义和封建主义的两条战线上，发挥了巨大的积极性和战斗性，不断加强和巩固人民民主政权，恢复国民经济，将抗战推向胜利。
    在工厂中、在公路上，在实验室里和在机关里，越南工人展开了如火如荼的竞赛运动，发挥了忘我的工作精神，以保证完成充分供给前线和满足人民的需要的生产计划。
    在过去的一年中，国防生产部门的工人，已经取得了许多成就。全体工人群众都卷入了轰轰烈烈的“保证质量，提高生产率，及时支援前线”的运动。
    护厂模范范文操，在敌机的疯狂轰炸和扫射下，仍勇敢地不离开发动机，他想：“如果跑开，锅炉的蒸汽多了就要爆炸，暴露了工厂的目标，并且锅炉坏了就不能保证生产。”所以，他坚守在锅炉的周围，给锅炉加水，并想办法使煤烟不至上升。烟囱的拉索被敌机炸断了，他就爬上烟囱，把它盖住。当敌机扫射时，他就隐藏起来，敌机飞过他就出来工作。这样，当敌机走后，工人们回来，机器立即又开始转动，保证了不间断的生产。
    在中越南部第五联区，军械部门工人所完成的一九五三年上半年计划，等于一九五二年全年的生产量。一九五二年年底的两个月中所生产的武器总数等于一九五二年上半年的生产总数，并保证了产品的质量。
    随着前线的日益增长的需要，供应前方的工作，非常重要。但是敌机一天天加紧破坏公路，扫射运输工具。越南人民军在前线的战斗越激烈，交通运输工人在公路桥梁战线上也就更加英勇地进行战斗。他们克服一切困难，排除敌人所造成的阻碍，完成了及时地供应前线的任务。
    敌人利用各种武器如重型炸弹、凝固汽油弹、降落伞炸弹、定时炸弹、空中爆炸弹等，企图切断或破坏供应前线的交通线。但是敌人绝不能削弱桥梁工人的勇敢和决心，也不能阻挡成万的民工来保卫和修理道路。检定时炸弹的英雄青年团员黄廷卓，在敌机轰炸时，不顾危险，动员弟兄们把泥土涂在身上，使敌机不能发现，然后冲到公路上去，挖掉了敌人的两颗定时炸弹，并且经过研究，他终于创造了破坏敌人炸弹的作用的办法。这样，我们英勇的护路工人不但保卫了交通线的安全，而且还利用敌人炸弹里的火药，来炸碎石头修筑道路。
    运输工人获得了辉煌的成绩。运输公司某车队，增加了运输量百分之五，节约了汽油消耗定额的百分之九。尽管敌人日夜不停地扫射，仍能保证完成任务。该车队荣誉地获得了胡志明主席的奖旗。广大人民群众不畏艰险和克服困难的斗争精神以及他们的巨大努力，保证了对前线部队的及时和充分的供应。
    满足前线日益增长的需要是现在各生产部门工人的重要任务。同时，增加生产以满足人民对生活必需品的需求也十分迫切。特别是经过发动农民群众彻底实行减租和实行土地改革后，农民对物质和文化的需要比以前大大地提高了。因此，工人们积极地改进技术、增加生产、提高质量、降低成本来供应日益扩大的市场的需要，并充分创造对敌进行经济斗争的力量。国营企业所展开的“增加产品，降低成本”运动，已经取得许多成绩。由于提高质量，降低成本，各企业在去年一年中就为国家积累了大量的资金。
    全国造纸业迅速地发展着，仅第四联区，一九五三年的产额就比一九五二年增加了百分之十六，成本平均降低了百分之二十到三十。黄文树工厂全年产额超过了计划的百分之九点八，废品率从百分之七降到百分之一点七，成本降低了百分之十八；先后两次降低了纸张的价格，而产品的质量却比以前更好。其他生产部门如：布业、糖业、肥皂业等也都有所发展。特别值得注意的是农具生产部门，给发动起来的农民群众和新解放区农民，供应了充分的农具。去年农具部门工人，为了生产更好的农具供给农民，曾有很多创造，成本平均降低百分之十五到三十。工人还组成许多小组，到农村去修理水车，并传授制造和使用各种水车的方法，和农民一起研究和实行吸水灌溉工作。越南工农联盟日益巩固起来。
    在八年抗击法国侵略者和美国干涉者的斗争中，越南工人阶级不断地按照胡志明主席的教导，提倡自力更生的精神，克服各种困难，为伟大的民族抗战事业贡献出巨大的力量。
    越南工人阶级热烈希望在自己国土上实现和平，以便全力建设像苏联、中国和各人民民主国家一样的幸福生活。
    全世界工人阶级和人民在要求停止侵略越南的战争和恢复印度支那和平运动中的积极支援，使越南工人阶级和人民更加振奋地加强了胜利的信心。
    越南工人阶级热烈欢迎正在举行的为和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平，以缓和国际紧张局势的日内瓦会议。越南工人阶级和全国人民一道，在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的英明领导下，加强与以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的团结，加强国内各阶层人民的团结，特别是工农劳动人民的紧密联盟，努力发展生产，加强战斗，以粉碎美、法好战分子继续和扩大侵越战争的阴谋。
