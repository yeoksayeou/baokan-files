Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently concluded the work of transferring five hundred members of local committees, or equivalent to this level or higher, to participate in industrial construction. Of these, one hundred entered factories and mines in January, and the remaining four hundred are awaiting assignment. In addition, the North China Bureau has decided to transfer another one thousand one hundred county committee members, or equivalent to the county committee member level, this year to enrich and strengthen the grassroots leadership backbone in newly built factories and mines. This task has already been arranged at a meeting, and local Party committees are currently selecting and reviewing candidates.

In order to successfully complete China's First Five-Year Plan, the North China Bureau's decision to transfer a large number of cadres to work in newly built factories and mines, as well as other expanded and renovated factories and mines, has received enthusiastic support from Party organizations at all levels. When selecting these cadres, all localities prioritized the selection of outstanding cadres and completed the tasks on schedule and in full numbers. Among the cadres transferred, more than one hundred and thirty are currently leading cadres at the level of prefectural committee secretary, commissioner, department head, or bureau chief and above. This group of cadres has undergone long-term revolutionary struggle training, and many of them are veteran cadres who have been tested since the Second Revolutionary Civil War. This group of cadres has relatively rich work experience and high political awareness, and their educational level is above secondary school.

In recent years, the North China Party organization has always paid attention to the training of cadres for industrial construction. From the time they entered the cities in 1949 to the end of 1953, more than 22,400 cadres were transferred from rural areas to industrial departments. Many of these people have now been trained to become competent leading backbones in industrial construction and have assumed important positions in factories and mines.

    华北选拔优秀干部参加工业建设
    【新华社二十四日讯】中共中央华北局选拔五百个地方委员会委员或相当于这一级以上的干部转入工业建设的工作已在最近结束。其中除一百个已在一月间进入厂矿外，其余四百个正待命分配。另外，华北局并决定在今年内再抽调一千一百个县委员会委员或相当于县委委员一级的干部充实和加强新建厂矿中基层领导骨干。这项任务已经召开会议布置下去，各地党委正在遴选审查中。
    为了胜利完成我国第一个五年建设计划，华北局抽调大批干部转入新建厂矿及其它扩建、改建厂矿去工作的决定，得到了各级党组织的热烈拥护和支持。各地在选拔这批干部时，都是尽先选优秀的干部，并且按期如数完成。这批调出的干部中，现任地委书记、专员、厅长、局长以上的主要负责干部就有一百三十余人。这批干部经过了长期的革命斗争锻炼，其中有不少是第二次国内革命战争时期久经考验的老干部，这批干部有较丰富的工作经验和较高的政治觉悟，文化水平都在中学程度以上。
    华北党组织在这几年来，时刻注意对工业建设干部的培养。自一九四九年入城以来至一九五三年年底，从农村调转工业部门的干部就有二万二千四百余个。其中有许多人今天已经锻炼成为工业建设方面胜任的领导骨干，担任了厂矿中的重要职务。
