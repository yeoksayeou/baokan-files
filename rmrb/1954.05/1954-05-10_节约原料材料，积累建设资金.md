	Launch a Competition to Save Steel Materials
	The workers of No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel Works have formulated a conservation plan. They guarantee to save the country 273 tons of steel materials in the second quarter while increasing production, improving quality, and producing steel according to specifications.
	Since last year, the workers of No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace have comprehensively fulfilled the state production plan every month. They have also gradually reduced product costs while increasing production and improving quality. From March to December last year, they saved the state steel materials worth 473.5 million yuan. The state's steel material consumption quota for the first quarter of this year was reduced by 1.61% compared to last year, but the consumption of steel materials per ton by the furnace workers in the first quarter of this year was even lower than the state quota. The total value of steel materials saved for the state during the entire quarter was 384 million yuan. The steel materials they saved in one year, from March last year to March this year, can be used to refine nearly 700 tons of steel. Now, they have launched a competition to accumulate funds for socialist construction in order to complete the conservation plan for the second quarter.
	Creating Advanced Board Cutting Methods
	In the past, workers in the box-making workshop of the Second Glass Factory of the Dalian Construction Engineering Bureau would cut whatever materials were available. Any remaining wooden boards about a foot long would be taken to burn in boilers and cook food. In this way, an average of more than 10,000 kilograms of wood, worth more than 16 million yuan, was wasted each month. During the increase production and conservation movement, they made a detailed accounting and realized that saving wood was a major issue. Therefore, the cutting team leader, Lü Huilan, created an advanced board cutting method that eliminated small wooden boards of about a foot long. After this cutting method was promoted, it gradually improved the technical level of the workers. Now, when workers cut materials, they must calculate what kind of wood is suitable for cutting boxes of what specifications before they start, greatly reducing the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes. In the first quarter of this year, the workers in this workshop saved more than 170 cubic meters of wood, worth more than 178.8 million yuan. This wood can be used to make more than 1,600 desks.
	Saving Raw Materials Worth Over 100 Million Yuan in Half a Year
	Li Hongxing, a worker at the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company's shipyard, cherishes state property and often pays attention to saving raw materials. One day, a worker had just received 15.6 meters of brand-new red copper pipe from the warehouse and was about to cut it into 70-millimeter pieces. After seeing this, he said with heartache: "Oh, it's such a pity to cut such a long copper pipe into small pieces. It's not only labor-intensive but also wasteful. Don't cut it, I have some over there." This suggestion saved the state 15 meters of red copper pipe.
	Li Hongxing gathers up any leftover materials he sees, whether from work or found on the road, and keeps them for use. Once, he modified 120 meters of seamless steel pipe removed from old ships and used them all on new trailers. In this way, he saved the state more than 100.3 million yuan in wealth in six months.
	Improving the Air Vent of the Iron Melting Furnace Can Save 8,000 Tons of Coke a Year
	The iron melting furnace in the first workshop of the Anshan Cast Pipe Factory originally had two rows of air vents, while the iron melting furnace in the nearby second workshop used three rows of air vents to melt iron, which saved more coke than the first workshop. The workers in the first workshop then proposed to the technicians to improve the air vents. Later, the technicians modified the original two rows of air vents in the workshop to three rows according to the Soviet method, and the experiment was successful. The daily production of the two iron melting furnaces in the workshop originally required 14 kilograms of coke to melt 100 kilograms of iron, but after the improvement, it only required 11 kilograms, which can save the state at least about 8,000 tons of coke per year, reduce costs by 0.5%, and increase the temperature of the iron melting furnace by 5 to 10 degrees Celsius.
	Replacing Rubber Rings with Paper Rings
	An oil depot of the China Petroleum Company's Shanghai branch had to fill many oil drums with oil every day. When filling, each barrel mouth had to be padded with a rubber ring to prevent moisture from entering the barrel and avoid oil deterioration. The deputy director of the oil depot, Pan Juqian, and Meng Yichu, thought that most of the rubber was currently imported, so if the rubber ring could be replaced with a substitute, it would save rubber. They saw in a Soviet publication that Soviet oil drums were not padded with rubber rings but with paper rings. They immediately absorbed this advanced experience and tried to make paper rings that could prevent oil and water erosion. At first, they tried to make them with cardboard, but they failed. Later, they used a kind of hemp board paper, and the paper rings made were not afraid of oil and water erosion and could completely replace rubber rings, and the price was 30% cheaper than rubber rings. In this way, this oil depot alone can save hundreds of kilograms of rubber raw materials every year.
	Recovering Parts Worth Over 120 Million Yuan from a Scrap Iron Pile
	Wang Dongjiang is a worker who repairs rock drills in the Western Mining Department of the Longyan Iron Mine. One afternoon in January of this year, he was carrying a bamboo basket to go down the mountain to buy household sundries and was passing by the storage yard when he saw a large pile of scrap iron thrown there. He looked carefully and saw that there were many parts from rock drills that could be used in the scrap iron pile. A few days ago, he had heard that this pile of scrap iron had been sold to a steel factory for 50 yuan per kilogram. So he hurriedly went to find the person in charge. After he got permission, he rummaged through the scrap iron pile and picked out a lot of parts. He didn't finish picking them until it was dark, so he went home with an empty basket.
	The next day, he told the workers in his group about this matter, and the whole group used their spare time to pick them up. The parts picked back were assembled, and the preliminary test results were very good. They could replace ten new rock drills, saving the state 120 million yuan in wealth.
	Promoting Experience in Saving Cotton to Conserve Raw Cotton
	In March, the East China Textile Administration paid attention to summarizing the experience of several cotton textile factories under its jurisdiction in saving cotton, and later successively introduced various measures taken by the Tianjin and Qingdao textile factories to save cotton. One of the important measures taken by various places to save raw cotton is to make full use of chop-cut flowers (i.e., waste flowers from the carding machine). At present, state-owned Shanghai No. 1, 2, 5, 6, and 11 cotton textile factories have installed fiber impurity separators, and the effect is good. It is estimated that using seven jin of chop-cut flowers per yarn can reduce costs by more than 20,000 yuan. According to the experience of the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 cotton textile factory, improving the finished product rate in each process, reducing defective products, and reducing waste are also effective ways to save cotton. At present, the East China Textile Administration is promoting this experience. If this work is done well, the state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai can save the state 800,000 jin of raw cotton this year. This cotton is equivalent to the yield of more than 26,000 mu of cotton fields. If used for spinning yarn and weaving cloth, it can spin more than 2,000 pieces of yarn and weave more than 70,000 bolts of cloth, which can provide 560,000 people with a new uniform each.

    节约原料材料，积累建设资金
    为节约钢铁料展开竞赛
    鞍钢炼钢厂八号平炉职工，已制订出节约计划，他们保证在提高产量、质量、按钢种出钢的条件下，在第二季度给国家节省二百七十三吨钢铁料。
    八号平炉职工从去年到现在，每个月都全面完成国家生产计划，并在提高产量、质量的条件下，使产品成本逐步降低。他们从去年三月到十二月，共给国家节省价值四亿七千三百五十万元的钢铁料。今年第一季度国家的钢铁料消耗定额要比去年降低百分之一点六一，但该炉职工今年第一季度每吨钢铁料消耗量又比国家定额低了。全季共给国家节省价值三亿八千四百万元的钢铁料。他们从去年三月到今年三月一年中所节省的钢铁料，共可炼出将近七百吨钢。现在他们为完成第二季度节约计划，已展开了积累社会主义建设资金的竞赛。
    创造先进裁板法
    旅大市建筑工程局第二玻璃厂制箱车间的工人，过去什么材料凑手就割什么，剩下一尺左右的木板就被拿去烧锅炉、做饭了。这样，平均每月要浪费木材一万多公斤，价值一千六百多万元。在增产节约运动中，他们算了一个细账，才觉得节约木材是个大问题。于是裁锯组长吕惠兰就创造了先进裁板法，可以不出一尺左右的小木板了。这个裁板法经推广后，逐渐提高了工人技术水平。现在工人下料时都要核算一下，看什么样的木材割什么规格的箱子合适，然后再动手，大大减少了大材小用的现象。今年第一季度，这个车间工人共节省了一百七十多立方公尺木材，价值一亿七千八百多万元。用这些木材，可以制成一千六百多张办公桌子。
    半年节省原材料值一亿多万元
    中苏造船公司造船厂工人李洪兴爱护国家财产，经常注意节省原材料。有一天，一个工人刚从仓库领来十五点六公尺崭新的红铜管子，要截成七十公厘一块的。他看后心痛地说：“哎呀，这样长的铜管子，割成小块多可惜，不但费工，而且浪费材料。不用割了，我那里有。”这一建议给国家节省了十五公尺长的红铜管子。
    李洪兴不管看见干活剩下的料，或是走道碰见的料，都把它集中起来，留着使用。有一次他把从旧船上卸下来的一百二十公尺无缝钢管，修改了一下，都用到新造托车上去了。这样，他在六个月中，就给国家节省了一亿零三百多万元的财富。
    改进熔铁炉风眼一年能节省八千吨焦炭
    鞍钢铸管厂第一车间的熔铁炉，原是两排风眼的，而附近第二车间的熔铁炉，却用三排风眼熔铁，烧的焦炭比第一车间省。第一车间的工人便向技术员提出改进风眼的建议。后来，技术人员按照苏联的方法将该车间原两排风眼，改为三排，结果试验成功。该车间每日两个熔铁炉生产，原来熔一百公斤铁需十四公斤焦炭，改进后仅用十一公斤，每年至少能给国家节省约八千吨焦炭，降低成本百分之零点五，并提高了熔铁炉的温度摄氏五度至十度。
      用纸圈代替橡胶圈
    中国石油公司上海分公司一个油库，每天要把很多油料灌装到油桶里去。在灌装时，每个桶口要垫上一块橡皮圈，防止水分进到桶里，避免油料变质。油库副主任潘菊潜和孟一初想到：目前橡胶还大部分是进口货，如果能把橡皮圈改用代用品，就能节省橡胶。他们看见苏联出版的书上，讲到苏联灌装油桶时，桶口不垫橡皮圈，而是垫一种纸做的圈。他们马上吸取这个先进经验，试制能够防止油水浸蚀的纸圈。开始时，他们用马粪纸试做，没有成功；后来又用一种麻板纸，做出来的纸圈不怕油、水浸蚀，完全可以代替橡皮圈，价格比橡皮圈便宜百分之三十。这样，单是这个油库，每年可以节省好几百斤橡胶原料。
      从废铁堆里拣出了价值一亿二千多万元的零件
    王东江是龙烟铁矿西部采矿部修理钻岩机的工人。今年一月里的一天下午，他拿着竹篮子到山下去买家用的零碎东西，正路过存料场子，看见有一大堆废铁乱扔在那里。他仔细一看，废铁堆里面还有很多钻岩机上能用的零件。前些天他曾听说这堆废铁已按五十元一公斤卖给某钢厂了。于是就急忙去找负责人。他得到允许后，就把废铁堆拨弄开了，拣了不少零件，直挑到天黑还没挑完，他就提着空篮子回家了。
    第二天，他把这事向组里的工人说了，全组工人就利用业余时间去拣。拣回的零件经过装配，初步试验结果很好，能顶十部新的钻岩机使用，给国家节约了一亿二千万元的财富。
    推广节约用棉经验，节省原棉
    华东纺织管理局在三月份就注意总结所属的几个棉纺织厂节约用棉的经验，以后又相继介绍了天津、青岛纺织厂节约用棉的各种措施。各地节约原棉的重要措施之一是充分利用抄斩花（即梳棉机的下脚花）。目前，国营上海第一、二、五、六、十一等棉纺织厂已装设了纤维杂质分离机，效果还好，估计每件纱羼用七斤抄斩花，可以降低成本二万多元。根据国营上海第十六棉纺织厂的经验，提高各工序中的制成率，减少废品，减少浪费也是节约用棉的有效办法。目前华东纺织管理局正在推广这一经验。这些工作做好了，今年上海国营棉纺织厂就可以为国家节省原棉八十万斤。这些棉花相当于二万六千多亩棉田的产量，如果用来纺纱织布，可以纺二千多件纱，织七万多匹布，可供五十六万多人每人做一套新制服。
