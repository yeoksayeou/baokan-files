Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 18th: The Polish News Agency reports that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Polish People's Republic, S. Skrzeszewski, sent telegrams to the President of the Eighth UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General on May 17 regarding the illegal seizure of the Polish merchant ships "Praca" and "Gottwald" by the Kuomintang bandits.

The telegram to the President of the Eighth UN General Assembly stated: On May 13, Chiang Kai-shek's pirates, with the active participation of American aircraft, carried out an armed attack on the Polish merchant ship "Gottwald," located 450 nautical miles east of Taiwan, and illegally detained the ship and its personnel.

As you know, about half a year ago, the Polish merchant ship "Praca" was attacked and forcibly seized under similar circumstances, and the crew members are still being detained in Taiwan. In both of these incidents, the responsibility for violating the norms of international law should be borne by the United States. The armed forces of the United States government control the sea surface in the area and have turned the island of Taiwan into a base for their aggression. The United States government is using the Kuomintang bandits as a tool to carry out provocations and use violence to undermine international relations. The Government of the Polish People's Republic requests you to take necessary measures to immediately return the two seized Polish ships and release their personnel. The Polish government believes that the United Nations will take due position on this matter in the spirit of respecting the basic principles of international law and freedom of navigation, safeguarding the security of Asian countries, and promoting their relations with Europe and other countries in the world.

In a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski pointed out that the United Nations, despite Poland's repeated efforts in the United Nations, has taken a passive stance on the piratical seizure of the merchant ship "Praca," which has encouraged Chiang Kai-shek's American masters to carry out new provocations.

    波兰外长致电联大主席和秘书长
    要求就立即归还被劫波兰商船事采取措施
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社华沙十八日讯：波兰通讯社报道，波兰人民共和国外交部部长斯·斯克热歇夫斯基，十七日就国民党匪帮非法劫走波兰商船“布拉卡”号和“哥特瓦尔德”号事，致电联合国第八届大会主席和联合国秘书长。
    致联合国第八届大会主席的电文中说：五月十三日，蒋介石的海盗们在美国飞机的积极参与下，对离台湾以东四百五十浬的波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德”号实行了武装袭击，并非法扣留了船只和人员。
    如您所知道的，约在半年以前，波兰商船“布拉卡”号曾在类似的情况下受到进攻并被强力劫走，该商船的人员至今还被扣留在台湾。在这两次事件中，破坏国际法准则的责任应由美国担负。美国政府的武装部队控制了该地区的海面，并把台湾岛变成了自己的出袭的基地，美国政府利用国民党匪帮作为实行挑衅和使用暴力以破坏国际关系的工具。波兰人民共和国政府请您就立即归还两艘被劫走的波兰船只和释放其人员一事采取必要的措施。波兰政府相信，联合国在这个问题上将本着尊重国际法的基本原则和航行自由、保障亚洲国家安全和促进它们跟欧洲及世界其他国家的关系的精神，采取应有的立场。
    斯克热歇夫斯基外长在致联合国秘书长的电文中指出：联合国不顾波兰在联合国中的多次的努力，竟对海盗式地劫走“布拉卡”号商船一事采取消极的立场，这样就鼓舞了蒋介石的美国主子进行新的挑衅。
