Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 10th: TASS, Moscow, May 10th: "Pravda" reporters Zhukov and Prischevsky report from Geneva: When the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded its second week of work on May 8th, it began to discuss the second item on the agenda, namely the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The foreign ministers discussed the issue of inviting delegations from the Khmer and Lao resistance governments to participate in the conference, because the people of Khmer and Laos, who are defending freedom and independence, have liberated a large part of their territory and established democratic governments.

The reporters pointed out: This issue immediately became the center of public attention. When referring to the Western countries' representatives rejecting the suggestion of inviting representatives from Khmer and Laos, many observers pointed out that those who opposed this suggestion wanted to obstruct the discussion of the Indochina issue by all possible means.

When speaking at the meeting on May 8th, Bidault referred to the governments of Laos and Cambodia as "phantom" governments. To this, the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, solemnly replied that in the past, the country he represented had also been subjected to the same slander. The Soviet representative to the United Nations had once rightly questioned: Then why haven’t the numerous fully armed occupying forces been victorious in a war against a "phantom" government after many years? After that, the occupying forces suffered even greater defeats. Now the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is sitting together with France and other representatives participating in the conference to jointly discuss how to establish peace in Indochina.

The "Pravda" reporters asked: Isn't it obvious that the attempt to ignore the actual existence of Khmer and Laos is doomed to failure in the end?

Zhukov and Prischevsky concluded by writing: It is of great significance to the cause of peace that all five major powers and other relevant countries can participate in the discussion of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. The public in all countries who are concerned about easing international tensions are closely following the progress of the conference. They severely condemn the conspiracies of those who try to obstruct the work of the conference and to complicate the international situation by expanding the war.

    “真理报”记者评邀请高棉和寮国抗战政府参加会议问题
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：“真理报”记者茹科夫与普利歇夫斯基自日内瓦报道：日内瓦外长会议于五月八日结束第二周工作的时候，开始讨论议程的第二项，即恢复印度支那的和平问题。
    外长们讨论到邀请高棉和寮国抗战政府的代表团参加会议的问题，因为保卫着自由和独立的高棉与寮国人民，已经解放了很大一部分国土，而且建立了民主政府。
    记者指出：这个问题立刻成为公众注意的中心。在讲到西方国家的代表们拒绝关于邀请高棉与寮国代表的建议时，许多观察家指出：反对这个建议的人们是要用一切可能的办法来阻挠讨论印度支那问题。
    皮杜尔在五月八日的会议上发言时，把寮国与高棉的政府称为“幽灵”政府。对于这一点，越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同庄严地回答说：在过去，他所代表的国家也曾遭到同样的诬蔑，苏联出席联合国的代表曾经很正当地质问：那么为什么许多全副武装的占领军对于一个“幽灵”政府进行了许多年的战争还没有胜利呢？在这之后，占领军还遭受了更大的惨败。现在越南民主共和国的代表团已经和法国以及其他参加会议的代表们坐在一起，共同讨论如何建立印度支那和平的问题了。
    “真理报”的记者问道：想要无视实际上存在的高棉与寮国这两个国家的企图，最后也是注定要失败的。这不是很明显的吗？
    茹科夫与普利歇夫斯基最后写道：在日内瓦会议上讨论印度支那问题时能有所有五大国与其他有关国家参加，这对于和平事业有非常重要的意义。世界各国关心缓和国际紧张局势的公众，都在密切地注意着会议的进展。他们严厉地斥责那些设法阻挠会议的工作以及用扩大战争的办法来使国际形势更加复杂的人们的阴谋。
