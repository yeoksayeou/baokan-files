Fujian Provincial Agricultural Implement Experiment Factory, based on the characteristics of the province having many mountains, streams, and rapid water flow, has created a hydraulic pumping machine – a water turbine pump. The water turbine pump does not use fuel, nor does it require specialized technical workers to manage. Wherever there is a rapid current or a place where the tidal bore is significant, a dam can be built to install and use it. According to the factory's water pumping experiment in Xujia Village, Seventh District, Minhou on May 3rd, with a water level difference of one meter, a single water turbine pump can pump 32 *dan* of water per minute to a height of four meters. One water turbine pump can irrigate approximately 350 *mu* of farmland. As the water level difference increases, the water output, pumping height, and irrigated acreage of the water turbine pump also increase. With a 4.5-meter water level difference, a single water turbine pump can pump 66 *dan* of water per minute to a height of 18 meters, irrigating up to 700 *mu* of farmland. If the pump part of the water turbine pump is removed and a long main shaft is attached, it can drive a rice milling machine or a generator. With a water level difference of 1.5 meters, the small rice milling machine driven by the water turbine pump can mill more than eight *dan* of rice per hour. The electricity generated by the small generator it drives can supply the needs of 200 fifteen-watt light bulbs.

The successful trial production of the water turbine pump will play a certain role in promoting the mechanization of agricultural production in mountainous areas and improving agricultural productivity.

    福建省农具试验厂创制水轮泵成功
    福建省农业厅农具试验厂根据该省山多溪多、水流湍急的特点，创造了一种水力抽水机——水轮泵。水轮泵不用燃料，也不需要专门技术工人管理，凡是有急流的地方或海潮顶淡较大的地方，堵起水坝就可安装使用。根据该厂五月三日在闽侯七区徐家村试验抽水，在水位差达一公尺的情况下，一架水轮泵每分钟能把三十二担水抽到四公尺高的地方，一架水轮泵就可灌溉农田三百五十亩左右。随着水位差的提高，水轮泵的出水量、抽水高度和灌溉亩数也能随着增加。在四点五公尺水位差的情况下，一架水轮泵每分钟能把六十六担水抽到十八公尺高的地方，灌溉农田可达七百亩左右。水轮泵拆去水泵部分，配上长主轴，就可以拖动碾米机或发电机。水位差一公尺半高时，水轮泵带动的小型碾米机每小时可碾米八担以上，带动的小型发电机所发的电，能供给二百盏十五支光电灯的需要。
    水轮泵的试制成功，对促进山区农业生产机械化、提高农业生产力将起一定作用。
