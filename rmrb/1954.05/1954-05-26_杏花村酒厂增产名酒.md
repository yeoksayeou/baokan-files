    Xinghua Village Distillery Increases Production of Famous Liquor

    This year, the Xinghua Village Distillery in Shanxi will produce more Fenjiu and Zhuyeqing to supply all parts of the country. Xinghua Village's liquor is a world-renowned famous liquor, which participated in the Panama World Expo and won the first prize. It is said that Xinghua Village has accumulated more than a thousand years of winemaking experience. The brewing process is very meticulous and clean, and the fermentation time is as long as forty days (generally about ten days).
    Xinghua Village is located thirty miles east of Fenyang County in Shanxi Province and is an ancient village with more than a thousand households. The villagers have been engaged in winemaking as a sideline for generations. According to ancient village inscriptions, Fenjiu has a history of 1,400 years. As early as the Northern and Southern Dynasties, winemaking had already begun in the village. The site of the Xinghua Village Distillery is said to be the site of the "Baoquan No. 1" winery of the Tang Dynasty. The Xinghua Village Distillery was founded in the late Qing Dynasty and has now been in existence for more than fifty years. After being taken over by the state in 1949, it was expanded and mechanical equipment such as diesel engines and crushers were added, increasing output more than four times. Due to improvements in brewing technology, the amount of sorghum required to produce one jin of Fenjiu has been reduced from three jin to two and a half jin. To further meet the needs, the factory will increase production of rose wine and Yinchen wine this year, and is planning to build a new factory with an annual output of 800,000 jin of wine.

    杏花村酒厂增产名酒
    山西杏花村酒厂今年将生产更多的汾酒和竹叶青，供应全国各地。杏花村的酒，是誉满世界的名酒，曾参加巴拿马万国博览会，获得一等优胜奖。相传杏花村已经积累千多年的酿酒经验，酿造过程非常细致清洁，发酵时间长达四十天（一般约十天左右）。
    杏花村在山西省汾阳县城东三十里处，是一个有一千多户人家的古村。村人世代以酿酒为副业。据村中古碑记载，汾酒有一千四百年历史，远在南北朝时，村里就已开始酿酒。杏花村酒厂所在处，传说是唐“宝泉一”酒家的遗址。杏花村酒厂自清末创办，到现在，有了五十多年历史。一九四九年改由国家专营后，曾进行扩建，并增加柴油引擎和粉碎机等机械设备，使产量增加四倍以上。由于酿造技术的改进，由过去三斤高粱制造一斤汾酒，降低到二斤半高粱制造一斤汾酒。为进一步满足需要，今年该厂将增产玫瑰酒和茵陈酒，并筹建一座每年产酒八十万斤的新厂。（金雨困）
