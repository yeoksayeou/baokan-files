    Strengthen Party Leadership and Consolidate Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations
    The Poor and Middle Peasants are More United
    The Zhao Desheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongwa Village, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, when conducting education on consolidating the alliance between poor and middle peasants among its members, mobilized them to examine their own thinking. Everyone found that a few cadres and some members, during the expansion of the cooperative, actively mobilized middle peasants to join, but adopted a "take it or leave it" attitude towards poor peasants. Some leading cadres even fundamentally opposed absorbing poor peasants. After the cooperative absorbed five or six poor peasant households, he became passive in his work. The middle peasants who had joined the cooperative felt that if there were too many poor peasants in the cooperative, they would suffer losses and their income would decrease. In addition to educating these cadres and members about the need for poor and middle peasants to unite and improve production, the Party and cooperative leadership also gave everyone an account: Zhou Ruifu, a middle peasant, had an annual income of 1,144 jin of grain in 1952 before joining the cooperative; last year, after joining the cooperative, his annual income was 2,905.5 jin of grain, more than 1,700 jin more than before joining. Then, Zhou Ruifu was compared with Zhao Jiangcheng, another middle peasant: Zhao Jiangcheng's grain production decreased because he withdrew from the cooperative and worked independently, his income decreased, his good livestock were replaced by poor livestock, and his life was not as good as when he was in the agricultural production cooperative. At this time, Sun Zhaowu, a middle peasant member, said: "Chairman Mao's path is absolutely correct. There is only benefit and no harm for poor and middle peasants to participate in agricultural production cooperatives." After this review, the poor and middle peasants in the cooperative became more united. During the discussion on investment, everyone unanimously proposed that investment should be based on the strength of the members themselves and not be required to be the same. When a few members had difficulties, everyone agreed that the cooperative would temporarily lend them some grain, which could be deducted from the dividends in the autumn.
                            (Yang Qian, Lu Yonghua)
      Cooperatives and Groups Must Unite
    When our township established agricultural production cooperatives, a problem arose. The peasants who were approved to join the cooperative were very happy and said, "It is a great honor to participate in the agricultural production cooperative!" The peasants who were not approved to join the cooperative pouted when they saw the members and said nothing. After the branch knew about this, it held a branch meeting to discuss the issue. At first, some comrades did not recognize this as a problem of unity between cooperatives and groups, so they said, "We only need to run the agricultural production cooperative well." The branch believed that to run the cooperative well, attention should be paid to the unity of cooperatives and groups. Therefore, the branch led everyone to study the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on the development of agricultural production cooperatives, helping everyone to realize that to develop agricultural production cooperatives, the work of mutual aid groups should also be valued. If the mutual aid groups are not doing well, the entire township's production will not be good, and the agricultural production cooperatives cannot be further developed. After every Party member and every cadre understood this principle, the branch assisted the agricultural production cooperative in holding a members' meeting, persuading the members to actively establish close contact with the mutual aid groups, and correcting various ideas of belittling the mutual aid groups. At the same time, it organized Communist Party members to go deep into the villages and areas to publicize the conditions that must be met for establishing a cooperative.
    A few days later, the Party branch held a joint meeting of agricultural production cooperative directors and mutual aid group leaders in Xiaozhaigou, the village where the agricultural production cooperative was located, inviting the mutual aid group leaders to talk about their opinions on the branch and the agricultural production cooperative, and the current difficulties in the mutual aid groups. They talked about two points: First, they were dissatisfied with the agricultural production cooperative members' belittling and ridiculing them; second, after some mutual aid groups were disbanded, they lacked farm tools, had no livestock, and had great difficulties in production. The director of the agricultural production cooperative, on behalf of all the members, sincerely reviewed the past mistakes of belittling the mutual aid groups; and expressed that in the future, under the principle of not affecting their own production, they would try their best to help the mutual aid groups solve various difficulties. The branch stated that it would definitely help everyone reorganize and restore the disbanded mutual aid groups. After this meeting, most of the problems were resolved. Mutual aid group leader LÃ¼ Zongxin said: "Today's meeting was really good, and what the branch secretary said really hit home. As the saying goes, 'Wood won't penetrate if you don't drill, and words won't be clear if you don't speak.' This time, I really understand." He also said, "Don't worry, everyone. I will definitely be responsible for untying the 'knots' between the groups and the cooperatives, and take the lead in improving my group and creating conditions for transferring to the cooperative next year." Subsequently, the branch held a meeting to discuss ways to reorganize and restore the mutual aid groups. The result of the discussion was to appropriately merge the disbanded mutual aid groups according to the specific situation and the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Now, not only have all the disbanded mutual aid groups in our township been reorganized, but also many peasants have organized six more mutual aid groups. In order to strengthen the leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement, our township has also formed a mutual aid and cooperation committee, which studies the mutual aid and cooperation problems of the entire township every ten days under the unified leadership of the Party branch, and holds a symposium of cooperatives and groups every month to exchange experiences and do a good job.
        (Wang Shaobin, Secretary of the Baozhang Township Branch of the Communist Party of China in Mengjin County)
      Collective Strength is Great
    During the expansion of the Qinggang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bishan County, Sichuan last winter, it was planned to build a weir to divert the spring water from the mountains near the agricultural production cooperative to irrigate the fields. This was a relatively large project, with the weir more than six li long, and a 59-zhang-long aqueduct to be erected between two small hills. Most of the members wanted to build the weir quickly, but some people were unwilling to build it. Some people did not believe that the weir could be built, and even the Party member Sun Kexiang said, "Can such a big project be built so easily?" Some people were afraid that the burden would be too heavy if it was built. Jiang Mingzhong said, "After joining the agricultural production cooperative, we have to contribute money and labor, and there is nothing left but pot scrapings." Some people were unwilling to work on the weir because their land had good water conservancy conditions. According to this situation, the Party branch carried out political and ideological work among the members, first enabling the members to recognize that water conservancy construction is the primary key to ensuring increased production, and using methods such as detailed accounting to explain the benefits of building the weir. If this weir could be completed according to plan, it could guarantee the timely transplanting of seedlings on 600 mu of land in the whole cooperative, and 400 mu of paddy fields could be converted into two-season fields, and another season of wheat could be planted after autumn. If calculated at 250 jin of wheat per mu, the whole cooperative could increase its income by 100,000 jin of wheat a year, while the construction cost would only be more than 30,000 yuan and 2.5 cubic meters of earthwork on average per shi of "water-receiving field." Secondly, everyone should be educated to believe that the strength of organization is great, and with the government's loans and the dispatch of technical cadres to help, it will definitely be completed on schedule. After repeated and patient education, the weir construction project started. Communist Party members Liu Yuanju, Long Shuhui, and others influenced everyone with their exemplary actions on the construction site. For example, some members were late and left early, while Liu Yuanju and Long Shuhui did not even go home for lunch, but had their families bring it to the construction site. This exemplary action promoted everyone to work actively and overcome slack emotions. Soon, the project was officially completed, and the spring water flowed into the fields through the six-li-long weir. Yin Zerong, a member who originally did not believe that it could be built, looked at the flowing spring water and said, "What is flowing here is not water, but grain!" More importantly, through this specific event, everyone realized the greatness of collective strength.
(Luo Qimeng, Xiao Qilu)
