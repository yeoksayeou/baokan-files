    Strengthen Party Leadership and Consolidate Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations
    The Poor and Middle Peasants are More United
    The Zhao Desheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongwa Village, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, when conducting education on consolidating the alliance between poor and middle peasants among its members, mobilized them to examine their own thinking. Everyone found that a few cadres and some members, during the expansion of the cooperative, actively mobilized middle peasants to join, but adopted a "take it or leave it" attitude towards poor peasants. Some leading cadres even fundamentally opposed absorbing poor peasants. After the cooperative absorbed five or six poor peasant households, he became passive in his work. The middle peasants who had joined the cooperative felt that if there were too many poor peasants in the cooperative, they would suffer losses and their income would decrease. In addition to educating these cadres and members about the need for poor and middle peasants to unite and improve production, the Party and cooperative leadership also gave everyone an account: Zhou Ruifu, a middle peasant, had an annual income of 1,144 jin of grain in 1952 before joining the cooperative; last year, after joining the cooperative, his annual income was 2,905.5 jin of grain, more than 1,700 jin more than before joining. Then, Zhou Ruifu was compared with Zhao Jiangcheng, another middle peasant: Zhao Jiangcheng's grain production decreased because he withdrew from the cooperative and worked independently, his income decreased, his good livestock were replaced by poor livestock, and his life was not as good as when he was in the agricultural production cooperative. At this time, Sun Zhaowu, a middle peasant member, said: "Chairman Mao's path is absolutely correct. There is only benefit and no harm for poor and middle peasants to participate in agricultural production cooperatives." After this review, the poor and middle peasants in the cooperative became more united. During the discussion on investment, everyone unanimously proposed that investment should be based on the strength of the members themselves and not be required to be the same. When a few members had difficulties, everyone agreed that the cooperative would temporarily lend them some grain, which could be deducted from the dividends in the autumn.

      Cooperatives and Groups Must Unite
    When our township established agricultural production cooperatives, a problem arose. The peasants who were approved to join the cooperative were very happy and said, "It is a great honor to participate in the agricultural production cooperative!" The peasants who were not approved to join the cooperative pouted when they saw the members and said nothing. After the branch knew about this, it held a branch meeting to discuss the issue. At first, some comrades did not recognize this as a problem of unity between cooperatives and groups, so they said, "We only need to run the agricultural production cooperative well." The branch believed that to run the cooperative well, attention should be paid to the unity of cooperatives and groups. Therefore, the branch led everyone to study the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on the development of agricultural production cooperatives, helping everyone to realize that to develop agricultural production cooperatives, the work of mutual aid groups should also be valued. If the mutual aid groups are not doing well, the entire township's production will not be good, and the agricultural production cooperatives cannot be further developed. After every Party member and every cadre understood this principle, the branch assisted the agricultural production cooperative in holding a members' meeting, persuading the members to actively establish close contact with the mutual aid groups, and correcting various ideas of belittling the mutual aid groups. At the same time, it organized Communist Party members to go deep into the villages and areas to publicize the conditions that must be met for establishing a cooperative.
    A few days later, the Party branch held a joint meeting of agricultural production cooperative directors and mutual aid group leaders in Xiaozhaigou, the village where the agricultural production cooperative was located, inviting the mutual aid group leaders to talk about their opinions on the branch and the agricultural production cooperative, and the current difficulties in the mutual aid groups. They talked about two points: First, they were dissatisfied with the agricultural production cooperative members' belittling and ridiculing them; second, after some mutual aid groups were disbanded, they lacked farm tools, had no livestock, and had great difficulties in production. The director of the agricultural production cooperative, on behalf of all the members, sincerely reviewed the past mistakes of belittling the mutual aid groups; and expressed that in the future, under the principle of not affecting their own production, they would try their best to help the mutual aid groups solve various difficulties. The branch stated that it would definitely help everyone reorganize and restore the disbanded mutual aid groups. After this meeting, most of the problems were resolved. Mutual aid group leader Lü Zongxin said: "Today's meeting was really good, and what the branch secretary said really hit home. As the saying goes, 'Wood won't penetrate if you don't drill, and words won't be clear if you don't speak.' This time, I really understand." He also said, "Don't worry, everyone. I will definitely be responsible for untying the 'knots' between the groups and the cooperatives, and take the lead in improving my group and creating conditions for transferring to the cooperative next year." Subsequently, the branch held a meeting to discuss ways to reorganize and restore the mutual aid groups. The result of the discussion was to appropriately merge the disbanded mutual aid groups according to the specific situation and the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Now, not only have all the disbanded mutual aid groups in our township been reorganized, but also many peasants have organized six more mutual aid groups. In order to strengthen the leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement, our township has also formed a mutual aid and cooperation committee, which studies the mutual aid and cooperation problems of the entire township every ten days under the unified leadership of the Party branch, and holds a symposium of cooperatives and groups every month to exchange experiences and do a good job.

      Collective Strength is Great
    During the expansion of the Qinggang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bishan County, Sichuan last winter, it was planned to build a weir to divert the spring water from the mountains near the agricultural production cooperative to irrigate the fields. This was a relatively large project, with the weir more than six li long, and a 59-zhang-long aqueduct to be erected between two small hills. Most of the members wanted to build the weir quickly, but some people were unwilling to build it. Some people did not believe that the weir could be built, and even the Party member Sun Kexiang said, "Can such a big project be built so easily?" Some people were afraid that the burden would be too heavy if it was built. Jiang Mingzhong said, "After joining the agricultural production cooperative, we have to contribute money and labor, and there is nothing left but pot scrapings." Some people were unwilling to work on the weir because their land had good water conservancy conditions. According to this situation, the Party branch carried out political and ideological work among the members, first enabling the members to recognize that water conservancy construction is the primary key to ensuring increased production, and using methods such as detailed accounting to explain the benefits of building the weir. If this weir could be completed according to plan, it could guarantee the timely transplanting of seedlings on 600 mu of land in the whole cooperative, and 400 mu of paddy fields could be converted into two-season fields, and another season of wheat could be planted after autumn. If calculated at 250 jin of wheat per mu, the whole cooperative could increase its income by 100,000 jin of wheat a year, while the construction cost would only be more than 30,000 yuan and 2.5 cubic meters of earthwork on average per shi of "water-receiving field." Secondly, everyone should be educated to believe that the strength of organization is great, and with the government's loans and the dispatch of technical cadres to help, it will definitely be completed on schedule. After repeated and patient education, the weir construction project started. Communist Party members Liu Yuanju, Long Shuhui, and others influenced everyone with their exemplary actions on the construction site. For example, some members were late and left early, while Liu Yuanju and Long Shuhui did not even go home for lunch, but had their families bring it to the construction site. This exemplary action promoted everyone to work actively and overcome slack emotions. Soon, the project was officially completed, and the spring water flowed into the fields through the six-li-long weir. Yin Zerong, a member who originally did not believe that it could be built, looked at the flowing spring water and said, "What is flowing here is not water, but grain!" More importantly, through this specific event, everyone realized the greatness of collective strength.

    加强党的领导，巩固互助合作组织
    贫农中农更加团结了
    山西省屯留县东洼村赵德胜农业生产合作社，在向社员进行巩固贫农中农联盟教育时，发动社员联系检查自己的思想。大家检查出来有少数干部和部分社员在扩社时，对中农积极动员其入社，但对贫农则采取“愿者就来，不愿则罢”的态度，甚至还有个别领导干部根本反对吸收贫农入社，在社里吸收了五、六户贫农以后，他就消极怠工。已入社的中农则认为社里贫农多了，他们就会吃亏，就会减少收入。党和社的领导方面除对这些干部、社员进行了贫农中农团结起来搞好生产的教育外，还给大家算了一笔账：中农周瑞甫，一九五二年未入社时，全年收入粮食一千一百四十四斤；去年入了社，全年共收入了粮食两千九百零五斤半，比入社前多收入一千七百多斤。接着，又把周瑞甫和中农赵江成比了一下：赵江成因为中途退社单干，粮食减收，收入减少，好牲口换成了赖牲口，生活也不如在农业生产合作社时好了。这时，中农社员孙兆武就说：“毛主席指出的路就没差错，贫农、中农参加农业生产合作社后只有利没有害。”经过这次检查，社里贫农和中农更加团结了。在讨论投资时，大家一致提出要按照社员本身的力量来投资，不能一样要求。少数社员有困难时，大家同意社里暂借给他们一部分粮食，借的粮食可在秋后分红时扣除。

      社和组要团结起来
    俺乡成立农业生产合作社时，发生了一个问题，被批准入社的农民非常高兴地说：“参加农业生产合作社真光荣！”没被批准入社的农民见了社员就噘着嘴，一句话也不说。支部知道后，便召开支部大会，讨论这个问题。起初有些同志不认识这是社和组的团结问题，所以他们说：“咱们只要把农业生产合作社办好了就行。”支部认为要办好合作社，就要注意社和组的团结。因此支部领导大家学习了中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，帮助大家认识到要发展农业生产合作社，也要重视互助组的工作，互助组搞不好，全乡的生产就搞不好，农业生产合作社也就不能进一步发展。在每个党员和每个干部都懂得这个道理后，支部协助农业生产合作社召开社员大会，说服社员主动和互助组取得密切联系，纠正各种轻视互助组的思想。同时又组织共产党员分工深入到各村各片向农民宣传建社必须具备那些条件。
    过了几天，党支部在农业生产合作社的所在村小寨沟又召开了农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长联席会议，请互助组组长谈谈他们对支部对农业生产合作社的意见和目前互助组中的困难。他们谈了两点：一、不满意农业生产合作社社员轻视他们讥笑他们；二、个别互助组被拆散后，缺农具，没牲口，生产中的困难很大。农业生产合作社社长就代表全体社员向大家虚心检讨了过去轻视互助组的错误；并表示今后在不影响自己生产的原则下，尽量帮助互助组解决各种困难。对已散伙了的互助组，支部表示一定帮助大家整顿恢复起来。经过这次会议，问题解决了一大半。互助组长吕宗心说：“今天这个会开得真好，支部书记说的真入我的耳。俗话说：‘木不钻不透，话不说不明’，这回我心里真亮堂了。”他还说：“大家放心吧，我一定负责把组、社的‘疙瘩’解开，并带头把俺的组搞好，创造来年转社条件。”随后支部开会讨论整顿恢复互助组的办法。讨论的结果是根据具体情况和自愿互利的原则，把散伙的互助组适当合并起来。现在俺乡散伙的互助组不但都重新组织起来了，而且又有不少农民组织了六个互助组。为了加强对互助合作运动的领导，俺乡又组成了互助合作委员会，在党支部的统一领导下，每十天研究一次全乡的互助合作问题，每月召开一次社、组座谈会，交流经验，搞好工作。

      集体力量大
    四川璧山县青杠农业生产合作社在去年冬天扩社过程中，就酝酿要修一条堰沟，把农业生产合作社附近山上的泉水引下灌田。这是一项比较大的工程，堰沟有六里多长，还要在两个小山坡之间架起五十九丈长的渡槽。大多数社员要求把堰沟很快修起来，但是也有部分人不愿意修这条堰沟。有的人是不相信堰沟能修得起来，连党员孙可相也说：“这样大的工程，轻易就能修起来吗？”有的人是怕修起来负担太重，蒋明中就说：“入了农业生产合作社，又出钱又出工，除了锅巴没有饭了。”有的人因为自己田地水利条件好，就不愿出工修堰。党支部根据这种情况向社员进行了政治思想工作，首先使社员认清兴修水利是保证增产的首要关键，并采用算细账等办法说明修堰沟的好处。这条堰沟能够按计划完成的话，就能保证全社六百亩田按时插秧，并可把四百亩水田改为两季田，秋后就可多种一季小麦。如以每亩收小麦二百五十斤计算，全社一年就可增加十万斤小麦的收入，而修建费每石“受水田”平均只负担三万多元和二方半土工。其次教育大家应当相信组织起来力量大的道理，在人民政府贷款和派技术干部帮助之下，一定能按期修成的。经过反复耐心的教育以后，修堰工程开工了。共产党员刘元菊、龙树辉等在工地上以模范行动影响大家。比如有些社员迟到早退，而刘元菊、龙树辉连午饭都不回家吃，叫家里送到工地上来吃。这种模范行动就推动大家积极劳动，克服了松懈情绪。不久，工程正式完成了，泉水经过六里多长的堰沟流到田里。原来不相信能修成的社员尹泽荣，望着流来的泉水说：“这流来的不是水，是谷子呀！”更重要的是通过这一具体事情，使大家认识到集体力量的伟大。　　　　　　　（罗启蒙、萧启禄）
