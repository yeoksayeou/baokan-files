    Shenyang's Patriotic Health Campaign Enters a Regular Phase
    The spring patriotic health campaign in Shenyang has entered a regular phase. Since the beginning of spring, all districts have convened People's Congresses one after another, mobilizing the masses and launching extensive health campaigns. Tiexi District first focused on the Shenyang Transformer Factory, and after a thorough cleaning without affecting production, it organized representatives from various factories in the district to visit, reversing the erroneous perception of some leading cadres who pitted completing production tasks against doing a good job in sanitation. After the visit, employees of factories such as the Fan Factory and Agricultural Implement Factory actively participated in voluntary labor, not only removing accumulated dust but also cleaning up a large number of usable mechanical parts from waste materials. Women in the streets of Shenhe District and Dadong District focused on watching children so that they could free up time to dig up fly pupae. Under the slogan of "Dig Clean, Dig Completely," Beishi District dug up more than 23,000 jin of fly pupae by the end of April. Residents of Nanshi District filled in the stinking ditch, three li long, on Nanyi Jing Road.
    Currently, factories, government offices, schools, and street residents in Huanggu, Nanshi, Shenhe, and Dadong districts have begun to revise patriotic health covenants. Residents of Bajing Road and Yunji Street in Nanshi District have proposed specific measures to improve environmental sanitation, making the health campaign a regular occurrence.

    沈阳市爱国卫生运动转入经常化
    沈阳市春季爱国卫生运动转入经常化。入春以来，各区都先后召开人民代表大会，发动群众，掀起广泛的卫生运动。铁西区先以沈阳变压器厂做重点，在不影响生产情况下，经过彻底清扫，然后组织该区各厂代表参观，扭转了一部分领导干部把完成生产任务和做好卫生工作对立起来的错误认识。参观之后，扇风机、农具等厂职工积极参加义务劳动，不仅清除了积尘，而且从废料中清理出大量能用的机械零件。沈河区、大东区的街道妇女，集中看孩子，以便抽出身来挖蝇蛹。北市区在“挖净、挖绝”的口号下，到四月末全区挖出蝇蛹两万三千多斤。南市区居民填平了南一经路街长达三里的臭水沟。
    目前，皇姑、南市、沈河、大东等区的工厂、机关、学校和街道居民都已着手修订爱国卫生公约。南市区的八经路、云集街的居民，提出搞好环境卫生的具体措施，使卫生运动经常化。
