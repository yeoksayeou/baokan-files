    Anshan Iron and Steel Plants and Mines Formulate Technical Measures Plans to Strive for the Comprehensive Completion of the 1954 National Plan
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production units convened technical representative meetings to formulate technical measures plans for the comprehensive completion of the 1954 national plan. By the end of April, most of the factories and workshops in the rolling steel system had completed these meetings, while other units were either holding meetings or actively preparing for them.
    According to the requirements of the national plan, Anshan Iron and Steel's total production value this year will increase significantly compared to last year, with both the iron smelting system and the chemical system increasing by more than 30% compared to last year. The rolling steel system, excluding the primary rolling mill, is required to focus on improving product quality and saving raw materials. The technical representative meetings convened by each unit, based on these indicators and requirements of the national plan, combined with the actual situation of the unit, grasped key issues, and proposed and formulated technical measures plans. For example, the primary rolling mill, which is the "throat" of Anshan Iron and Steel's entire production system, needs to roll the steel ingots produced by the steelmaking plant into steel billets, and most of the steel billets needed by various rolling steel plants need to be supplied by it. Therefore, the national plan requires the primary rolling mill to greatly increase output. The technical representative meeting convened by the primary rolling mill, based on the national requirements and the plant's backward equipment and numerous shortcomings in technical operation, proposed more than 50 technical measures, including the transformation of the 24-stand rolling mill, the improvement and repair of the soaking pit, and the strengthening of equipment maintenance. By enacting the measures, it will increase production by more than 10%, and it will exceed the annual national plan by more than 4%. In order to ensure the effective implementation of the technical measures, each unit of Anshan Iron and Steel, which has already formulated a technical measures plan, has further formulated specific quarterly and monthly plans for the implementation of the technical measures, specifically stipulating the person in charge, the responsible department, and the start and completion dates for each technical measure.
    The technical representative meetings that have already been convened by various units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are all conducted under the unified leadership of the Party Committee or Party General Branch Committee and the administrative side. Before the meetings, each unit first mobilized the staff in the functional departments, especially the technical personnel and the main responsible persons of the workshops or teams, to summarize last year's production work, fully study the past rationalization proposals and the implementation of Soviet expert recommendations, and put forward preliminary draft technical measures. Subsequently, the preliminary draft technical measures were submitted to all employees for discussion, and all employees were mobilized to put forward rationalization proposals for completing the national plan. In this way, the content of the technical measures became richer and more complete. Finally, the leadership summarized and sorted out a relatively complete draft technical measures, which was submitted to the technical representative meeting for study and decision. After the meeting, the representatives who attended the meeting went to the workers in each team and group to convey the information, and at the same time, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League and other leading parties also carried out mobilization and organization separately in order to effectively implement the technical measures plan.
    Many units that have already convened technical representative meetings, the workers have reflected that this year's task is very clear, and they know how to do it. Party workers believe that the Party's political work and economic work can be more closely integrated. In previous years, when accepting the national plan, cadres and workers were very enthusiastic, but there was a lack of systematic and comprehensive methods to ensure the completion of the plan. Administrative cadres reflected that the situation is different this year. Leading cadres and workers have a good idea in mind, and they have practical and feasible technical measures to ensure the completion of the national plan, and everything is easier to handle. Recently, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is also actively preparing to convene a company-wide technical representative meeting. At this meeting, the technical measures for the entire company to ensure the completion of the 1954 national plan will be resolved, especially the mutual coordination, mutual support, and mutual creation of conditions for technical measures between various production units.

    为争取一九五四年国家计划的全面完成
    鞍钢各厂矿制订技术措施计划
    鞍山钢铁公司各生产单位召开技术代表会议，为全面完成一九五四年国家计划制订技术措施计划。到四月底为止，轧钢系统的大部分工厂、车间已开完这一会议，其他单位有的正在召开，有的积极为召开会议作好准备。
    根据国家计划的要求，鞍钢今年的生产总值比去年大大增加，炼铁系统和化工系统都比去年增加百分之三十多；轧钢系统除初轧外，要求着重提高产品质量和节约原材料。各单位召开的技术代表会议，就是根据国家计划的这些指标和要求，结合本单位的实际情况，抓住关键性问题，提出并制订技术措施计划的。如初轧厂，它是鞍钢整个生产系统的咽喉，炼钢厂生产的钢锭需要它来轧成钢胚，各轧钢厂需要的钢胚绝大部分又需要它来供应，所以国家计划要求初轧厂大力提高产量。初轧厂召开的技术代表会议，根据国家的要求和本厂设备落后、技术操作缺点较多的情况，提出了改造二十四连轧、改进和检修均热炉、加强设备维护工作等方面的技术措施共五十多项目，制订出技术措施计划。初轧厂只要能实现这一计划，就可以提高产量百分之十以上，并将超额完成今年国家计划百分之四以上。为了保证技术措施的切实实行，鞍钢已经制订出技术措施计划的各单位并进一步制订实现技术措施的每季和每月的具体计划，具体规定了每一项技术措施的负责人、负责部门以及开始和完工的日期等。
    鞍钢各单位已经召开的技术代表会议，都是由党委会或党总支委员会和行政方面统一领导进行的。在开会之前，各单位都首先发动职能机构中的工作人员，特别是技术人员、车间或班的主要负责人员，总结去年生产工作，充分研究过去已有的合理化建议和贯彻苏联专家建议的情形，提出初步技术措施草案。随后，把初步技术措施草案交到全体职工中去讨论，并发动全体职工提出完成国家计划的合理化建议。这样，技术措施的内容就更加丰富和完整。最后，由领导方面汇总和整理出一个比较完整的技术措施草案，交给技术代表会议研究并作出决议。在会议以后，参加会议的代表就分头向各班、组工人传达，同时党、行政、工会、青年团等领导方面，也分别进行动员和组织，以便有效地贯彻技术措施计划。
    许多已经召开技术代表会议的单位，职工们都反映今年任务很明确，知道了怎样干法。党的工作者认为党的政治工作和经济工作可以更加紧密地结合起来了。往年接受国家计划时，干部和工人虽然热情很高，但是缺乏有系统的、全面的保证完成计划的办法。行政干部反映，今年情况不同了，领导干部和工人心中都有了数，对保证完成国家计划有了切实可行的技术措施，什么事也好办了。最近，鞍山钢铁公司并在积极准备召开全公司的技术代表会议。在这个会上，将解决全公司为保证完成一九五四年国家计划的技术措施问题，特别是各个生产单位之间技术措施的互相配合、互相支援、互相创造条件的问题。　（新华社）
