    Peking University warmly celebrated its 56th anniversary on the 35th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The faculty and students of Peking University warmly welcomed guests and alumni who came to attend the anniversary celebration, as well as more than four thousand senior high school students from various middle schools in Beijing.

    The arrival of the Soviet Youth Delegation was warmly welcomed by all faculty and students. The Soviet Youth Delegation presented gifts such as photos of life at Moscow University to the students of Peking University.

    Among the guests were responsible persons from relevant departments of the Central People's Government and many scientists, scholars, and professors.

    The school held an exhibition introducing Peking University. Hundreds of pictures recorded the past and present of this long-established institution of learning. People saw from these pictures that Peking University once nurtured the seeds of the democratic revolution and experienced the historical years of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Today, it has entered a new historical era along with the motherland.

    The well-stocked Peking University Library displays many revolutionary documents. It also treasures rare books from the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting in color on display here is a woodcut five-color overprint painting from our country more than two hundred years ago.

    All twelve departments and other specialized courses in the school opened their exhibition rooms and laboratories. The Russian Language and Literature Department's exhibition room introduced the department's growth process. The Russian Department, founded thirty-four years ago by Li Dazhao and Cai Yuanpei, was soon abolished by the reactionary government. It was only restored after the founding of New China. The exhibition of the Chinese Language Training Class for foreign students at Peking University attracted the most visitors. Romanian student Dong Luo and Bulgarian student An Qi worked as receptionists in the exhibition room, explaining all the exhibits in fluent Beijing dialect. Their assignments were also on display in the exhibition room. Guests most liked to see the thoughts of the foreign students after coming to China to study.

    People also toured the campus. These days, Yellow roses and violets are in full bloom on campus, and the elms are newly green by the side of the Weiming Lake. The loudspeakers broadcast beautiful music. In front of the lawn of Beige, students from the Department of Mathematics and students from Beijing No. 3 Middle School and the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University held a get-together. China's famous mathematician Hua Luogeng talked with Peking University students and visiting high school students about the importance of mathematics and mechanics. Professor Feng Zhi of the Department of Western Languages introduced the major to the students; students of the Meteorology Specialization Course showed a film of meteorological reconnaissance soldiers and entertained students from Beijing No. 4 Middle School and the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University. Thousands of graduating high school graduates left the campus of Peking University happily, filled with confidence in their future studies. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京大学热烈庆祝五十六周年校庆
    北京大学在“五四”运动三十五周年纪念日，隆重地庆祝五十六周年校庆。北京大学的师生们热情地招待了前来参加校庆的来宾和校友，以及北京各中学的四千多个高中三年级学生。
    苏联青年代表团的来到，受到全校师生热烈的欢迎。苏联青年代表团把莫斯科大学的生活照片等礼物送给了北京大学的学生们。
    来宾中还有中央人民政府有关部门的负责人和许多科学家、学者、教授们。
    学校举办了“北京大学介绍”展览。数百幅图片记载了这座历史悠久的学府的过去和现状。人们从这些图片中看到：北京大学曾经孕育了民主主义革命的种子，经历了中国人民反帝、反封建的历史年代，今天她又随着祖国步入了一个新的历史时代。
    藏书丰富的北京大学图书馆，陈列着许多革命文献。这里还珍藏着从唐、宋到明、清以来的善本书籍。这里所陈列的一本彩色的十竹斋画谱，是我国在二百多年前的木刻五彩套印画。
    全校十二个系和其他专修科的展览室和实验室全部开放。俄罗斯语言文学系展览室介绍了这个系的成长过程。三十四年前由李大钊和蔡元培创办的俄文系，不久就被反动政府取消了。新中国成立后才恢复起来。吸引观众最多的是北京大学外国留学生中国语文专修班的展览。罗马尼亚留学生董洛和保加利亚留学生安奇在展览室里作招待员，他们用熟练的北京话讲解着全部展览品。展览室还展出了他们的作业。客人最喜欢看的是留学生写的来到中国学习后的感想。
   人们还游览了校园。这几天，校园内黄刺玫和紫罗兰盛开，未名湖畔，榆树新绿。扩音器放送着优美的乐曲。在北阁的草坪前，数学系的学生和北京市第三中学、北京师范大学附属中学的学生们举行联欢。我国著名数学家华罗庚在和北京大学学生及参观的高中学生们谈数学和力学的重要性。西语系冯至教授向学生们介绍了专业；气象专修科的学生放映了气象侦察兵的影片，招待北京市第四中学和北京师范大学附属中学的学生们。数千即将毕业的高中毕业生们怀着对未来学习专业的信心，愉快地离开了北京大学校园。　（新华社）
