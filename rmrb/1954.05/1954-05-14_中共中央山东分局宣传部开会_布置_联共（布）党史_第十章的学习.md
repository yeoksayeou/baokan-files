    The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Shandong Branch convened a meeting of the Shandong Provincial-level Organs “History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union” Lecturers Group on the morning of May 11th to study and arrange the lecturing and studying of Chapter 10 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" by cadres of Shandong provincial-level organs. The meeting first explained that the current study of Chapter 10 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" is being conducted on the basis of all cadres having studied the Party's general task during the transition period of the country, the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the CCP Central Committee, and related documents. Precisely because the above study has universally improved the political and policy levels of cadres, the lecturing level of the lecturers group also needs to be raised accordingly to meet the new requirements of cadre study. The meeting discussed and decided that the content of the lectures should mainly be based on the study outline "Economic Construction Problems in the Soviet Union's Struggle to Realize the Country's Socialist Industrialization" published in the "Study" magazine. Lecturers should be fully prepared, first study Chapter 10 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" well, and refer to other relevant documents, and put forward the main points of the lectures on the basis of thorough understanding. In terms of learning methods, the focus should be on studying theory, appropriately linking it with practical work, opposing both empty learning of theory without linking it with practice, and turning study discussion sessions into casual talks about practical work. At the same time, it is necessary to grasp the key points of learning so as to avoid generalized and superficial learning. In order to ensure sufficient study time, the original plan to complete the study of Chapter 10 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" in five weeks has been changed to eight weeks. The original plan to have ten lecturers lecture on Chapter 10 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" has been increased to fifteen. The study will begin in mid-June. Everyone is required to study intensively, oppose procrastination, and ensure that Chapter 12 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" is completed by the end of the year in accordance with the instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the East China Bureau.

    中共中央山东分局宣传部开会
    布置“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习
    中共中央山东分局宣传部于五月十一日上午召开山东省级机关“联共（布）党史”讲师团会议，研究和布置山东省级机关干部学习“联共（布）党史”第十章的讲授和学习问题。会议首先说明了目前学习“联共（布）党史”第十章，是在全体干部学习了党在国家过渡时期的总任务和中共中央四中全会决议及有关文件的基础上进行的。正因为上项学习使干部的政治水平和政策水平都普遍提高了，所以讲师团的讲授水平也需要相应地提高一步，以满足干部学习的新的要求。会议讨论并决定讲授的内容以“学习”杂志上所发表的“苏联为实现国家的社会主义工业化而斗争时的经济建设问题”学习提纲为主，讲师应充分准备，首先把“联共（布）党史”第十章学好，并参考其它有关文件，在融会贯通的基础上，提出讲授要点。在学习方法上要以学习理论为主，适当地联系实际工作，既反对不联系实际空学理论，也反对把学习讨论会变成实际工作漫谈会，同时要抓住学习重点，以免一般化泛泛地学习。为保证充分的学习时间，把原来计划五个星期内学完“联共（布）党史”第十章改为八个星期学完。把原来计划十名讲师讲授“联共（布）党史”第十章增加为十五名。学习将在六月中旬开始。要求大家紧张学习，反对拖沓现象，保证按照中共中央和华东局的指示，到年底学完“联共（布）党史”第十二章。
