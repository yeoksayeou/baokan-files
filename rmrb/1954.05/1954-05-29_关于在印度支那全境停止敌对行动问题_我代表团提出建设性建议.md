Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 27th: The nine-nation delegation continued to hold a restricted meeting on the 27th to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 27th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: According to sources here, at the meeting of the nine-nation delegation discussing the Indochina issue on May 27th, the delegation of the People's Republic of China made significant and constructive efforts to seek an agreement on military armistice. It is understood that the Chinese delegation believes that there are many common points and many differences in the statements made by the delegations in the past few days of discussions. The Chinese delegation suggested that the meeting reach an agreement based on the common points, in order to serve as a basis for further negotiations. At the same time, methods should also be found to resolve those differences.

To this end, the Chinese delegation put forward the following proposals at the May 27th meeting:

	"The countries participating in the Geneva Conference agree on the following basic principles for the cessation of hostilities in Indochina:
	(1) A complete ceasefire shall be implemented simultaneously throughout Indochina by all armed forces of the belligerent parties—army, navy, and air force.
	(2) The two sides shall begin negotiations on appropriate adjustments to the areas occupied by both sides and on the transfer of troops by both sides during the adjustments, as well as on other relevant issues that may arise.
	(3) Simultaneously with the cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina, the entry of various new troops and military personnel, as well as various weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina shall cease.
	(4) A mixed commission composed of representatives of the two sides' commands shall supervise the implementation of the various provisions of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities.
		The implementation of the above agreement shall also be subject to international supervision by a neutral nations commission.
		The issue of the membership of the neutral nations commission shall be considered separately.
	(5) The countries participating in the Geneva Conference shall be responsible for guaranteeing the implementation of the agreement.
		The nature of the obligations undertaken by the countries concerned shall be considered separately.
	(6) Mutual release of prisoners of war and detained civilians."

The Chinese delegation elaborated on its views point by point at the meeting. Regarding the issue of simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina, the Chinese delegation advocated that, at present, in Indochina, no matter which country, and regardless of regular or irregular forces, there must be a simultaneous ceasefire without exception. The Chinese delegation pointed out that it cannot be conceived that when Vietnam ceases fire, Cambodia and Laos cannot cease fire at the same time; nor can it be conceived that when Cambodia and Laos cease fire, Vietnam cannot cease fire at the same time. The dispersion of the war zones in Indochina is only a technical issue and does not hinder the principle of simultaneous ceasefire.

Regarding the issue of the areas where the troops of both sides are concentrated, that is, the adjustment of the areas of both sides, the Chinese delegation believes that the situations in the three countries of Indochina—Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—are not entirely the same. Therefore, after the principle of adjusting the areas of both sides is determined, it should be implemented according to the specific circumstances of the three countries, and thus the solutions will also be different. However, this does not prevent the meeting from reaching an agreement on the need to stipulate that both sides implement regional adjustments. The Chinese delegation agreed that the commands of the belligerent parties should not only establish contact locally but also send representatives to meet in Geneva immediately to begin negotiations on appropriate adjustments to the areas occupied by both sides and on the transfer of troops by both sides during the adjustments, as well as on other relevant issues that may arise. In this way, the meeting can entrust the issue of regional adjustments to the representatives of the two sides' commands for consultation and listen to their conclusions and suggestions. The Chinese delegation also believes that the issue of establishing demilitarized zones, proposed by the French delegation, can be discussed when the two sides negotiate the issue of regional adjustments.

Regarding the issue of stopping the entry of various new troops and military personnel, as well as various weapons and ammunition, from outside Indochina, the Chinese delegation believes that this principle should be implemented simultaneously with the cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina. The scope of implementation must include stopping the United States from transporting military personnel, weapons, and ammunition to all of Indochina. This is the most important condition for stopping foreign intervention. Specific issues such as the scope and method of implementation, as well as how to supervise the implementation of these provisions, can be resolved through negotiation.

Regarding the issue of ceasefire supervision, the Chinese delegation pointed out that two types of supervisory organizations have been proposed at the meeting to supervise the implementation of the various provisions of the ceasefire agreement. One is the mixed commission proposed by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is a ceasefire commission composed of representatives of the belligerent parties; the other is the neutral nations supervisory commission proposed by the Soviet delegation, which should be composed of neutral countries invited by agreement of this conference. The Chinese delegation believes that the scope of authority of these two organizations and their interrelationship can be stipulated with reference to the experience of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Chinese delegation pointed out that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has played an active role in ensuring the realization of the Korean armistice, and it has been basically successful in completing the tasks assigned to it by the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Regarding the issue of international guarantees, the Chinese delegation believes that it is necessary for all countries participating in the Geneva Conference to participate in this guarantee, and this principle should be established. Actions that violate the agreement should be subject to consultation and collective but not individual measures should be taken. This point should continue to be discussed to determine the nature of the obligations to be undertaken by the countries concerned.

Regarding the issue of the release of prisoners of war and detained civilians, the Chinese delegation believes that since both sides believe it is not difficult to resolve, it should also be established.

### 关于在印度支那全境停止敌对行动问题  我代表团提出建设性建议

    关于在印度支那全境停止敌对行动问题
    我代表团提出建设性建议
    【新华社日内瓦二十七日电】九国代表团二十七日继续举行限制性会议，讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    【新华社日内瓦二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：据此间的消息说，在五月二十七日讨论印度支那问题的九国代表团的会议上，中华人民共和国代表团为谋求在军事停战方面达成协议，作了建设性的重大努力。据悉，中国代表团认为，各国代表团在过去几天的讨论中的发言，有许多共同之点，也还有许多差异之点。中国代表团建议会议根据共同点达成协议，以便作为进一步商谈的基础。同时，对于那些差异之点也找寻方法加以解决。
    为此，中国代表团在二十七日会议上提出了如下的建议：
      “日内瓦会议与会各国对于在印度支那停止敌对行动的基本原则协议如下：
    （一）交战双方的一切武装力量——陆军、海军和空军——在印度支那全境同时实现完全的停火。
    （二）双方就有关双方占领区的地区的适当调整和在进行调整时双方军队的转移，以及可能发生的其他有关问题，开始谈判。
        （三）在印度支那全境停止敌对行动的同时，停止自印度支那境外进入各种新部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药。
    （四）由双方司令部代表组成的混合委员会，对停止敌对行动协定各项条款的履行，进行监督。
    对上述协定的履行，并应由中立国委员会进行国际监督。
    关于中立国委员会的成员问题，须另行考虑。
    （五）日内瓦会议与会各国负责保证协定的履行。
    关于有关各国所承担的义务的性质问题，须另行考虑。
      （六）互相释放战俘和被拘的平民。”
    中国代表团在会议上逐点申述了自己的意见。关于在印度支那全境同时停止敌对行动问题，中国代表团主张，目前在印度支那应该不分那一个国家，不分正规军和非正规军，都必须同时停火而没有例外。中国代表团指出：不能设想，当越南停火的时候，高棉和寮国却不能同时停火；也不能设想，当高棉和寮国停火的时候，越南却不能同时停火。印度支那作战地区的分散，只是一个技术问题，并不妨碍同时停火的原则。
    关于双方军队集结地区，也就是双方地区调整的问题，中国代表团认为，印度支那三个国家——越南、高棉、寮国的情况不完全相同，因而在双方地区调整的原则确定之后，还要根据三国的具体情况加以实施，因而解决办法也会有所不同。但这并不妨碍会议达成有必要规定双方实行地区调整的协议。中国代表团同意交战双方司令部除应在当地建立接触外，并应各派代表立即在日内瓦会面，就有关双方占领区的地区的适当调整和在进行调整时双方军队的转移，以及可能发生的其他有关问题，开始谈判。这样，会议就可将地区调整问题交给双方司令部代表协商，并听取他们的结论和建议。中国代表团还认为，关于法国代表团提出的建立非军事化地带的问题，可以在双方协商地区调整问题时加以讨论。
    关于停止自印度支那境外运入各种新的部队和军事人员以及各种武器和弹药的问题，中国代表团认为，这一原则应在印度支那全境停止敌对行动的同时实施。实施的范围一定要包括停止美国运送军事人员、武器和弹药到印度支那全境在内。这是停止外国干涉的最重要条件。关于实施的范围和方法以及如何监督这些规定的实施等具体问题，可以协商解决。
    关于停战监督问题，中国代表团指出，会议上已提出了两种监督组织，以监督停战协定各条款的实施。一种是越南民主共和国代表团提议的混合委员会，也就是由交战双方代表组成的停战委员会；另一种是苏联代表团提议的中立国监督委员会，这个委员会应由本会议协议邀请的中立国家来组成。中国代表团认为，这两种组织的职权范围和它们的相互关系，可以参照朝鲜停战协定的经验加以规定。中国代表团指出：中立国监察委员会在保证朝鲜停战的实现上起了积极的作用，它在完成朝鲜停战协定所赋予它的任务方面，基本上是成功的。
    关于国际保证问题，中国代表团认为，所有参与日内瓦会议的各国参加这一保证是必要的，应该把这一原则确定下来。对于破坏协定的行为应该进行协商，采取集体的但非个别的措施。这一点仍应继续讨论，以确定有关各国所应承担的义务的性质。
    关于释放战俘和被拘的平民的问题，中国代表团认为，既然双方都认为不难解决，也应该确定下来。
