Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. “Pravda” published an article by its special correspondents in Geneva, Zhukov and Pulishevsky, entitled: “The Responsibility of Participants in the Geneva Conference.”

	Zhukov and Pulishevsky pointed out that the new proposal put forward by the head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, at the meeting on May 14th aroused enthusiastic discussion among reporters covering the conference.

	They all unanimously believed that this proposal opened up a practical path to reaching an agreement on a major issue—stopping hostilities in Indochina—and supervising the implementation of the agreement. Everyone believed that the Soviet delegation’s proposal was new evidence proving the Soviet Union’s desire to achieve peace in Indochina as soon as possible.

	When Zhukov and Pulishevsky talked about how Western countries would respond to the Soviet government's new proposal, they wrote: So far, they have not expressed their willingness to discuss the value of the Soviet proposal, nor have they even expressed their willingness to let their own people know about this proposal.

	Readers of the bourgeois press are still kept in the dark, knowing nothing about the practical proposals put forward by representatives of democratic countries. At the same time, the bourgeois press is stepping up the creation of an atmosphere of war hysteria, frightening their readers, and inciting them against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	Zhukov and Pulishevsky wrote that in recent days, we had the opportunity to meet a British political leader who came to Geneva to "take the pulse of the negotiations"—in his own words. He did not hide his anxiety about the fact that while meetings of foreign ministers were being held to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese issues, talks aimed at expanding the war were also being held in Geneva. These talks are chaired by American diplomats. Their primary goal at this stage is to find a "legal basis" for direct intervention in the Indochina War.

	Zhukov and Pulishevsky pointed out that the advocates of the American "position of strength" policy have begun to clamor loudly to blackmail their British and French allies, while the Laniel government is preparing to expand the Indochina War.

	According to news reports, the U.S. military command intends to gain firm control over all important management levers in Indochina, leaving the French authorities (not to mention the Bao Dai puppet government) with only one task—to ensure the supply of cannon fodder.

	However, it must be pointed out that in France, there are growing calls against the short-sighted policies of certain leaders. The recent debates in the French National Assembly clearly reflected that the overwhelming majority of the French people hope to stop the adventurous policy in Indochina and hope that the Geneva Conference will be successful.

	However, the delegations of Western countries attending the Geneva Conference are still clinging to old things, unwilling to consider the actual situation, and attempting to restore and maintain the stale and outdated colonial order in Asia.

	Zhukov and Pulishevsky emphasized that in contrast to the plan to establish a new military bloc composed of countries attempting to maintain the colonial system, the head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, put forward the proposal at the Geneva Conference that Asian countries should work together to safeguard peace. Millions of men and women hope that the Geneva Conference will make a significant contribution to consolidating universal peace. Now, the participants of the Geneva Conference are faced with concrete proposals on two agendas.

	Zhukov and Pulishevsky finally wrote that the wheel of history cannot be turned back. In our era, it is impossible to ignore the will of the people who demand freedom and national independence. This means that when discussing the Korean and Indochinese issues, the participants of the conference must take into account the sacred principles for which the people of the colonies and dependent countries are fighting. This undeniable truth should serve as a pointer for the participants of the Geneva Conference, because they bear an extremely important responsibility to the people of the world, and the people of the world are expecting a resolution that can extinguish the flames of war in Asia.

    日内瓦会议参加者的责任
    ——“真理报”记者文章的摘要
      【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：“真理报”刊载了该报驻日内瓦特派记者茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基的一篇文章，题目是：“日内瓦会议参加者的责任”。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基指出，苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫在五月十四日会议上提出的新建议在采访会议消息的记者们中间引起了热烈的讨论。
    他们都一致认为，这个建议开辟了在一个重大问题——在印度支那停止敌对行动——上获致协议并监督协议的实施的实际道路。大家都认为苏联代表团的建议是一个新的证据，它证明了苏联的协助尽早实现印度支那和平的愿望。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基谈到西方国家将如何答复苏联政府的新建议时写道：到目前为止，它们还没有表示它们愿意讨论苏联建议的价值，甚至也没有表示愿意让它们国内的人民知道这个建议。
    资产阶级报纸的读者还蒙在鼓里，一点也不知道民主国家的代表们提出的切实可行的建议。同时，资产阶级报纸正在加紧制造战争歇斯底里的气氛，吓唬它们的读者，并鼓动他们来反对苏联、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基写道，这些天来，我们有机会遇见一个到日内瓦来“摸一摸谈判的脉搏”——这是他自己的说法——的英国政界领袖。他并不掩饰他对于下面这个事实的不安情绪，就是：与外交部长们举行讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的会议同时，日内瓦还在举行着目的在于扩大战争的会谈。这种会谈是由美国外交官主持的。他们在现阶段的首要目的就是为直接干涉印度支那战争寻找“法律根据”。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基指出，美国的“实力地位”政策的鼓吹者已开始大声叫嚷，来讹诈他们的英法盟友，而拉尼埃政府正在准备扩大印度支那战争。
    从报纸消息可以看出，美军司令部打算取得对印度支那一切重要管理杠杆的牢靠控制，只给法国当局（更不用谈保大傀儡政府了）留下一个任务——保证炮灰的供应。
    然而必须指出，在法国，反对法国某些首脑人物的短视政策的呼声愈来愈高了。法国国民议会最近举行的辩论明显地反映出，占压倒多数的法国人民希望停止在印度支那的冒险政策，希望日内瓦会议得到成功。
    但是，出席日内瓦会议的西方国家的代表团至今仍然死死抱住旧东西不放，不愿意考虑实际情况，企图在亚洲恢复和保持陈腐的过了时的殖民秩序。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基着重指出，与建立由企图保持殖民制度的国家组成的新军事集团的计划相对的，是中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来在日内瓦会议上提出的主张亚洲各国人民共同努力保障和平的建议。千百万男女希望日内瓦会议对于巩固普遍和平作出重大的贡献。现在，日内瓦会议的参加者面前摆着两项议程的具体建议。
    茹科夫和普利歇夫斯基最后写道，历史的车轮是不能扭转的。在我们这个时代，要想忽视要求自由和民族独立的人民的意志，是办不到的。这就是说，会议的参加者在讨论朝鲜和印度支那问题时，必须考虑到殖民地和附属国人民正在为之而斗争的这样一些神圣的原则。这个无可辩驳的道理应当作为日内瓦会议参加者的指针，因为他们对全世界人民担负着极其重大的责任，而世界人民正在期待着能够扑灭亚洲的战火的决议。
