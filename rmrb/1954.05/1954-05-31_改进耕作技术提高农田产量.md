Improve Farming Techniques to Increase Farmland Yield

“The vernalized wheat is really good!”

In the 8th Village of the 7th District of Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, there is a wheat field that is particularly eye-catching this year. While the wheat seedlings in other fields have just emerged, it is already more than two inches high and covered in green ridges. People passing by, after inquiring about the reason, cannot help but say enviously, "The vernalized wheat is really good!"

The story is as follows: When planting wheat, cadres from the agricultural technology extension station in the 8th Village came to the Wang Zhaoqing Agricultural Production Cooperative to help them implement vernalization treatment of wheat seeds (pre-sprouting the seeds before sowing), but it was opposed by the cooperative members. Bu Xianhai said, "Won't the sprouts freeze to death if planted in the ground like that?" Although the cadres of the extension station explained the principles of vernalization treatment in detail again and again, many people still did not believe it. Finally, the board of directors decided to use the vernalization method to plant one hectare of land as a trial.

Since the implementation of vernalization treatment and sowing on March 29, the cooperative members have been concerned about it. Some people went to the field to check every other day, and some were very worried, fearing that the seeds would be wasted if they did not sprout. "Vernalized wheat has emerged!" Upon hearing this news, people rushed to see it. Compared with the neighboring land, the vernalized wheat emerged six or seven days earlier and had taken root more than two inches deep in less than half a month. People's doubts were dispelled, and cooperative member Kan Xichun said happily, "Vernalized wheat emerges early and can avoid drought, how can it not yield more?" Some people said, "It's too late this year, we must all implement vernalization treatment when planting wheat next year!"

Mutual Teaching and Learning Promotes Mud-Water Seed Selection

When Nongchang Township in Shimian County, Xikang Province, began to promote the benefits of mud-water seed selection, many farmers did not believe that mud-water seed selection could remove chaff, half-filled grains, and seeds with insect pests. After understanding this situation, the work team and technicians went deep into the villages to first mobilize one or two farmers to take the lead in implementing mud-water seed selection, and invited nearby farmers to visit. Li Sancai, who originally did not believe in mud-water seed selection, put his four liters of grain seeds, which had been selected four times with clear water, into mud water, and immediately about half a liter of grain with insect pests and half-filled grains floated to the surface. As a result, many farmers learned about the benefits of mud-water seed selection and also learned how to do it. Township cadres and the work team organized the masses to teach and learn from each other, and promoted the advanced method of mud-water seed selection throughout the township. After learning how to do mud-water seed selection, farmer Huang Guangcai helped seven nearby farmers to also implement mud-water seed selection; the members of the Guangyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guangyuan Village of the township also actively taught the mud-water seed selection method to farmers outside the cooperative. As a result, 52 out of 55 farmers in the village implemented mud-water seed selection.

Deep Plowing, Fine Harrowing, Irrigation, and Spot Sowing

Farmers in the Tangwang Korean Autonomous Region of Tangyuan County, Songjiang Province, in order to complete this year's plan to increase rice production to 9,000 catties per hectare, implemented irrigation and spot sowing on more than 90% of the land, and launched a production increase competition. Driven by the competition, the quality of tillage operations has been greatly improved. Last year, the general plowing depth was only about three inches, and only more than 500 hectares reached four inches. This year, most of the land has reached four or five inches deep. The entire region has basically eliminated the rough phenomena of missed plowing, unevenness, and roughness. The land near the pond dikes that could not be cultivated in the past few years has also been cultivated. The better agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various villages have implemented dry harrowing this year, harrowing very finely, especially the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams that are preparing to use mechanical dry sowing, the quality of harrowing is even better.

Finding Increase-Production Tricks at High-Yielding Households

Although the farmers in Dongfang Village, Baishan Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, had an increase-production requirement this year, they could not find a way to increase production for a while. Communist Party member Huang Chaotong recalled that last year's yields were high and low. As long as he summarized experience among the masses, he could always find a way to increase production. He first led the Lai Jinlong mutual aid team to study and found that Lai Jinlong had harvested 260 catties of early rice from five fen of land last year, which was 20% more than the average field. The reason was that he used more soil fertilizer and dipped the soil fertilizer on the roots of the seedlings when transplanting. Another team member, Lai Wanlai, harvested 400 catties from eight fen of loam, also using this method.

After finding this method, Huang Chaotong actively went to study it with other mutual aid team leaders and farmers, and everyone was willing to study and try it out in their teams. In order to explain the specific practices clearly, Huang Chaotong also invited Lai Jinlong to introduce the benefits and practices of dipping seedling roots at a mass meeting. After everyone listened, their confidence increased, and they hurried to accumulate more soil fertilizer and prepare for dipping seedling roots. When transplanting began, Lai Jinlong gave a demonstration first; each mutual aid team sent people to learn. Everyone saw that this kind of transplanting was not difficult but could increase production, and they were willing to adopt this method. 95% of the 150 mu of early rice in the village adopted the method of dipping seedling roots.

Changed Unreasonable Old Habits

Farmers in Gongshu Township, Yulin County, Guangxi Province, have never had the habit of weeding and topdressing. Some farmers believe that the rice seedlings will turn yellow when the fields are weeded, and they do not believe that the advanced experience of weeding and topdressing can increase production. In response to this situation, the Chinese Communist Party branch and the work team of the township first held a Party branch meeting to study how to carry out the weeding and fertilizing campaign and strive for a bumper harvest of early rice. After full discussion, everyone unified their understanding and specifically studied and determined the methods for carrying out the weeding and fertilizing campaign. The next evening, a meeting of mutual aid and cooperation representatives of the township was held, and farmers who had gained increased production in the past by weeding and topdressing introduced their experience, which powerfully persuaded the farmers. After the meeting, the Li Jingwen mutual aid team immediately allocated eight laborers to weed the fields and exchanged 300 loads of nitrate mud for fertilizer. The Zhong Kenheng mutual aid team also organized fifteen team members to carry the pond mud back to dry and crush it, and then sprinkled it with human urine to prepare for topdressing when weeding. The Li Renliang mutual aid team has already dug 400 loads of nitrate mud. The weeding and fertilizing work throughout the township has now been launched.

Close Planting by Grading According to Soil Quality

The corn planting techniques of farmers in Fengle Township, Wuchuan County, Guizhou Province, are very backward, with little fertilizer applied and sparse planting holes, with plant spacing of about three or four feet, resulting in "extensive planting and meager harvest" every year. Last year, under the leadership of the People's Government, the Zeng Qinghao mutual aid team initially improved farming techniques, applied more fertilizer, and adopted the advanced experience of "single-plant close planting." As a result, production increased by 52% compared to 1952. This year, the Zeng Qinghao mutual aid team has developed into the Fengle Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative members have more confidence in accepting advanced experience, so all the corn adopted the new methods of warm water seed soaking and tung oil and ash mixing. They also planted closely by grading the quality of the soil. At present, all 108 loads of land in the cooperative have adopted the single-plant close planting method, and the plant spacing of the remaining stone cellars and slopes has been shortened compared to previous years.

"260" Changed to "450"

In the past, farmers in Guanshan Township, Chuxian County, Anhui Province, transplanted seedlings carelessly, and the yield was not high year after year. Even in bumper years, the average yield of rice per mu was only about 300 catties. This year, in order to ensure a bumper harvest of rice, the Wang Zao Fang mutual aid team repaired several ponds and accumulated a large amount of fertilizer. Mutual aid team leaders Yang Shijie and Wang Zhonghan thought that if they could improve the old method of transplanting seedlings, they would be more confident of increasing production this year. Therefore, they convened a meeting of team members and proposed the idea of implementing "small-plant close planting," but the team members believed that planting densely or sparsely was the same anyway; some also disliked close planting as troublesome. At this time, the team leaders guided everyone to calculate the accounts of increasing production through close planting. After a specific calculation, everyone realized that planting seedlings seven inches apart on each side would allow at least 12,000 plants to be planted per mu. In that case, one mu of land could yield about 450 catties. Therefore, they decided to implement appropriate close planting on all the paddy fields in the team this year. The "260 catties" increase production target in the team's original rice increase production plan has now been changed to "450 catties."

    改进耕作技术提高农田产量
    “春化的小麦真好！”
    黑龙江省绥化县七区第八村今年有一块麦田特别惹人注目，别的地里麦苗刚出土，它已二寸多高，绿油油地罩垅了。路过的人打听到缘由后，不禁羡慕地说：“春化的小麦真好！”
    故事是这样的，种小麦时，第八村农业技术推广站的干部到王兆青农业生产合作社来帮助他们实行麦种春化处理（在播种前先使种籽发芽），却遭到社员反对。卜宪海说：“那样种到地里不把芽冻死吗？”虽说推广站的干部一次又一次地详细解释春化处理的道理，可是仍有很多人不信。最后经理事会核计，决定用春化处理方法种一垧地试试看。
    自三月二十九日实行春化处理播种后，社员都惦记着，有的人隔一天就到地里去看看，有的人很担心，生怕不出苗把种子白费了。“春化小麦出土了！”听到这个消息人们都争着去看。与邻地一比春化的小麦早出六七天，还不到半月已扎根二寸多深。人们的怀疑打消了，社员阚喜春高兴地说：“春化小麦出得早，能躲过?期，哪能不多收？”有的人说：“今年晚了，明年再种小麦一定都实行春化处理！”
    互教互学推广了泥水选种
    西康省石棉县农场乡在开始宣传泥水选种的好处时，许多农民都不相信泥水选种能清除秕谷、半米和有虫害的种籽。工作组、技术员了解了这个情况后，就深入各村先动员一、两户农民带头实行泥水选种，并邀请附近的农民参观。原来不相信泥水选种的李三才，把自己用清水选了四次的四升谷种，放在泥水里，立刻浮出了约有半升有虫害和半米的谷子。这样一来，许多农民知道了泥水选种的好处，同时也学会了做法。乡干部和工作组就组织群众互教互学，在全乡内推广了泥水选种先进办法。农民黄光才学会了做泥水选种以后，就帮助附近七户农民也实行了泥水选种；该乡广元村广元农业生产合作社的社员，也积极向社外农民传授泥水选种法，结果全村五十五户农民就有五十二户实行了泥水选种。
    深耕细耙灌水点播
    松江省汤原县汤旺朝鲜族自治区农民，为了完成今年每垧水稻产九千斤的增产计划，在百分之九十以上的土地上实行了灌水点播，并且开展了增产竞赛运动。由于竞赛的推动，大大提高了耕地作业质量，去年一般的耠地都在三寸左右深，达到四寸的仅有五百多垧，今年绝大部分达到四、五寸深。全区基本消灭了漏耕、不整齐不平坦的粗糙现象，几年来池埂子附近耕不着的地也都耕起来了。各村较好的农业生产合作社和互助组今年都实行了干耙地，耙得很细，特别是准备采用机械干播的农业生产合作社和互助组耙地质量更好。
      到增产人家找增产窍门
    福建省晋江县柏山乡东方村农民今年虽有增产要求，但是一时找不到增产门路。共产党员黄朝通想起去年产量有高有低，只要到群众中总结经验，总可以找到增产门路的。他便首先领导赖金龙互助组来研究，发现赖金龙去年有五分田早稻收到谷子二百六十斤，比一般田多收两成。原因是多用土粪，并在插秧时，把土粪蘸在秧根上插下去。另一个组员赖挽来有八分壤田收了四百斤，也是用了这个办法。
    黄朝通找到了这个办法，就积极地去和其他互助组长、农民再加研究，大家都愿意在组内研究试用。为了把具体做法交代清楚，黄朝通又请赖金龙在群众会上介绍蘸秧根的好处和做法。大家听过以后，信心都高了，赶紧多积土粪，作好蘸秧根的准备。插秧开始时，赖金龙又先作了示范；各互助组都派人去学习。大家看到这样插并不困难，却能增产，都愿意采用这个办法。全村一百五十亩早稻，采用蘸秧根办法的有百分之九十五。
      改变了不合理的旧习惯
    广西省郁林县龚蜀乡农民向来没有耘田追肥习惯，有些农民认为耘的田禾苗会变黄，不相信耘田追肥能增产的先进经验。该乡中共支部和工作组即根据这个情况，首先召开党支部会议，研究怎样开展耘田施肥运动，争取早稻丰收。经过充分讨论后，大家统一了认识，并具体研究和确定了开展耘田追肥运动的办法。第二天晚上即召开乡互助合作代表会，由过去耘田追肥获得增产的农民介绍经验，这样有力地说服了农民。会后，李敬文互助组即调配了八个劳动力去耘田，还换了三百担硝泥作肥料。锺恳胜互助组也组织十五个组员，把塘泥担回来晒干打碎，用人尿淋过，准备耘田时作追肥。李仁良互助组已挖得硝泥四百担。现在全乡范围的耘田施肥工作，已经开展起来。
      按土质好坏分等密植
    贵州省婺川县丰乐乡农民种苞谷的技术非常落后，肥料放得少，窝窝打得稀，株行距约隔三四尺，年年都是“广种薄收”。去年曾庆豪互助组在人民政府领导下，初步改进了耕作技术，多施了肥料，并采用“单株密植”的先进经验，因此比一九五二年增产百分之五十二。今年曾庆豪互助组发展为丰乐农业生产合作社，社员对接受先进经验更有了信心，于是全部苞谷都采用温汤浸种和桐油、草木灰拌种的新办法。种的时候还分等密植。目前，全社有一百零八挑地都实行了单株密植法，其余的石窖和坡坡土都比往年缩短了株行距。“二百六十”改成了“四百五十”
    安徽省滁县官山乡的农民，过去栽秧马虎，产量年年不高，就是丰收年成，每亩水稻平均也只能收三百来斤。今年，王糟坊互助组为了保证水稻丰收，修好了几口塘，还积了大批肥料。互助组长杨士杰、王忠汉想如果再把旧的栽秧方法改进一下，今年增产就更有把握了。于是就召开组员会议，提出实行“小株密植”的意见，但是组员们认为栽稠和栽稀反正是一样；也有的嫌密植麻烦。这时组长就引导大家算密植增产账，大家具体一算，才明白按照七寸对方栽秧，一亩田至少可栽一万二千棵，那么一亩田就能收四百五十斤左右，因此，就决定今年全组水田都实行适当密植。该组原来水稻增产计划上的“二百六十斤”的增产指标，现在也改为“四百五十斤”了。
