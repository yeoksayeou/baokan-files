    Shenyang Railway Bureau and Fushun Coal Mine Sign Liaison Contract
    Vehicle Handover Situation Greatly Improves
    Fushun is one of China's major coal-producing areas. With the rapid development of the national construction cause, the connection between railways and mines needs to be further strengthened to ensure rhythmic production and balanced transportation. To this end, the Shenyang Railway Bureau and the Fushun Mining Bureau held a railway-mine technical collaboration conference at the Fushun Mining Bureau on April 26. At the meeting, responsible cadres from both sides reviewed the shortcomings in their past work. Wang Shu'en, Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, said: "In the past, the railway had many shortcomings in supplying empty cars to the coal mine on time, which affected the coal mine's production tasks. In the future, we will definitely improve the vehicle handover work and deliver empty cars on time." Li Xikui, National Railway Labor Model and Deputy Station Master of Shenyang South Station, said: "In order to supply coal mines with cars, Shenyang Station will further implement the rapid unloading method and promptly send the unloaded vehicles to Fushun." At the end of the meeting, representatives of both parties signed a technical collaboration contract (i.e., a liaison contract). The Railway Bureau guaranteed to send empty cars to the coal mine at the prescribed time every day, and the coal mine guaranteed to hand over the cars on time as stipulated by the Railway Bureau.
    In the month since the contract was signed, the vehicle handover situation has greatly improved, and the freight car dwell time in early May was 103 percent of the planned target. In order to consolidate this achievement, the Shenyang Railway Bureau began to produce a fixed schedule of eight train dispatches to the coal mine on May 20. This will further promote the better completion of coal mining and transportation tasks. (Li Wenguo)

    沈阳铁路分局和抚顺煤矿签订联系合同
    车辆接交情况大有好转
    抚顺是我国主要产煤地区之一。随着国家建设事业的飞跃发展，铁路与矿山的联系需要进一步加强，以保证有节奏地进行生产和均衡运输。为此，沈阳铁路分局和抚顺矿务局于四月二十六日在抚顺矿务局举行了铁路与矿山技术协作大会。会上，双方负责干部都检查了过去工作中的缺点。沈阳铁路分局局长王树恩说：“过去铁路对按时供给煤矿空车上存在很多缺点，影响了煤矿的生产任务，今后我们一定改善车辆接交工作，按时送达空车”。全国铁路劳动模范、沈阳南站副站长李锡奎表示：
  “为了供应煤矿装车，沈阳站将进一步贯彻快速卸车法，把卸下来的车辆及时送到抚顺”。会议最后由双方代表签订了技术协作合同（即联系合同），铁路分局保证每天按规定时间把空车送入煤矿，煤矿保证按铁路分局规定时间把车及时交出。
    合同签订后一个月来车辆接交情况已大有好转，五月上旬货车停留时间按计划完成百分之一百零三。沈阳铁路分局为了巩固这一成绩，于五月二十日开始做出固定的八次向煤矿送车顺序图，这样，对于更好地完成采煤与运输任务将起进一步的推动作用。（李文国）
