    Tianjin Railway Bureau Affiliated Units
    Exchange Advanced Experiences in Appraising Labor Models
    The Tianjin Railway Bureau's affiliated units have already appraised the 1953 Labor Models and Advanced Workers. After discussion and supplementation by the broad masses, the advanced experiences of thirty-nine Labor Models, nineteen Model Units, and three hundred seventy-seven Advanced Workers have been summarized. Preparations are currently underway to convene a bureau-wide representative conference of Advanced Workers to deeply promote these advanced experiences, in order to guarantee the completion of railway transportation tasks.

    These model figures have played a significant role in improving railway work and increasing transportation capacity. The No. 2 Shunting Team of the C Shift at Tianjin Station created a set of experiences in implementing the Li Xikui shunting method, and in more than 400 days, not a single accident occurred, and efficiency was also improved. The Xu Xingwang locomotive team of the Guye Locomotive Depot implemented the Soviet Lunin maintenance method, ensuring the quality of locomotives, eliminating locomotive delays, and safely travelling more than 400,000 kilometers. Shang Xianxin, a telegrapher at the Shijiazhuang Telegraph Section, created a record of 940,000 words without error.

    During this appraisal work, each unit held production meetings for the same type of work to discuss and learn from the experiences of the model figures. In the nine units of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau and the Guye Railway Sub-bureau, one hundred sixty-four production meetings for the same type of work were held, discussing the advanced experiences of eighty-nine types of work, further studying and promoting these experiences.

    天津铁路管理局所属各单位
    评选劳动模范交流先进经验
    天津铁路管理局所属各单位已经评选出一九五三年的劳动模范和先进工作者。经过广大群众的讨论和补充，三十九个劳动模范、十九个模范单位和三百七十七个先进工作者的先进经验，已经总结出来。目前正准备召开全局的先进工作者代表大会，深入推广这些先进经验，以保证铁路运输任务的完成。
    这些模范人物，对于改进铁路工作、提高运输能力，都起了很大的作用。天津车站的丙班第二调车组创造了一套执行李锡奎调车法的经验，在四百多天中，未发生一件事故，还提高了效率。古冶机务段徐兴旺包车组实行苏联的鲁宁保养法，保证机车质量，消除机车晚点的现象，安全地走行了四十多万公里。石家庄电务段电报员尚先鑫创造了九十四万个词无差错的纪录。
    在这次评选工作中，各单位都召开了同一个工种的生产会议，讨论和学习了模范人物的经验。在天津铁路分局和古冶铁路分局的九个单位中，召开了一百六十四次同一个工种的生产会议，讨论了八十九个工种的先进经验，进一步学习和推广这些经验。　　　　（陈迹）
