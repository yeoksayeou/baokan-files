    Attempting to Form Southeast Asia Aggression Bloc
    US, UK, France, and Three Other Countries to Hold Military Conference

[Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch] The US State Department announced on the 28th that the military representatives of the Chiefs of Staff of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and New Zealand will hold a meeting in Washington starting on June 3rd.

Washington has repeatedly and undisguisedly stated that the US government intends to lay the foundation for the establishment of a Southeast Asia aggression bloc at this meeting. The statement issued by the State Department said that the five-nation meeting would "supplement" the talks the United States is conducting with other countries. The statement also listed the talks that the United States is conducting with other countries to cobble together a Southeast Asia group: US Secretary of Defense Wilson's talks with the Philippine government in Manila, the US government's talks with the Thai military attache to the United States in Washington, and the US representatives' talks with the representatives of the three Bao Dai regimes of Indochina in Geneva. It is well known that the US's planned Southeast Asia aggression bloc includes exactly these members.

    企图成立东南亚侵略集团
    美英法等五国将开军事会议
   【新华社三十日讯】美国国务院二十八日发表声明宣布，美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰五国参谋总长的军事代表将于六月三日开始在华盛顿举行会议。
    华盛顿方面毫不掩饰地一再表示过，美国政府的意图是要在这次会议上为成立东南亚侵略集团奠定基础。国务院发表的声明中说，这次五国会议将“补充”美国与其他国家进行的会谈。声明中并列举了美国正在与其他国家进行的拼凑东南亚集团的会谈：美国国防部部长威尔逊在马尼拉与菲律宾政府进行的会谈，美国政府在华盛顿与泰国驻美国大使馆武官进行的会谈，美国代表在日内瓦与印度支那保大等三政权代表进行的会谈。大家知道，美国计划中的东南亚侵略集团正是包括这样一些成员的。
