On May 25th, 151 wounded and captured French soldiers were evacuated from Dien Bien Phu. On May 26th, another 149 wounded and captured French soldiers were evacuated from Dien Bien Phu.

The number of wounded and captured French soldiers evacuated from Dien Bien Phu in recent days has been particularly high. This is the result of the efforts of Vietnamese doctors, nurses, and civilian workers, who worked day and night to transport the wounded and captured French soldiers from the various field hospitals in Muong Thanh and Hong Cong to the airfield.

(Xinhua News Agency, May 24th) According to the Vietnam News Agency: On May 23rd, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army permitted French light aircraft to come to Dien Bien Phu to transport 130 wounded and captured French soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force.
