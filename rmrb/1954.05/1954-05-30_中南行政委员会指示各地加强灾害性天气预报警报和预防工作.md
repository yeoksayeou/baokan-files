Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 29th: The Central-South Administrative Committee has directed all localities to strengthen disaster weather forecasting, warnings, and prevention work. The directive pointed out: In recent years, due to the great development of the people's meteorological undertaking, coupled with the attention paid to meteorological work by Party and government organs in various places, effective measures have been taken in a timely manner to organize prevention and rescue efforts, which have prevented and reduced many losses in industry, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, salt industry, and other fields. Last year, on October 31, Hainan Island experienced a major wind disaster unseen in over a decade. Preparations were made in advance based on the gale forecast issued by the meteorological observatory, significantly reducing the damage caused by the disaster. The directive also pointed out: Meteorological work is still a young science. Our technical conditions and equipment cannot yet meet the growing demands of all sectors, and experience in organizing prevention is lacking. Therefore, the reduction of disaster losses has not been as great as it should be. To this end, the following is required of all localities: 1. Strengthen the forecasting and warning work for disastrous weather. Issue forecasts and warnings of large-scale disastrous weather as early as possible, and provide materials in advance so that relevant units can take preventive measures. 2. Do a good job in the transmission of weather forecasts and warnings, and in disaster prevention and rescue work. Local wind and flood prevention agencies should promptly check the transmission of disastrous weather forecasts and warnings and their effectiveness. For unified transmission, gale warning stations along rivers, coasts, and lakes should be uniformly established by shipping or aquatic product departments, and meteorological agencies at all levels should provide assistance. Gale warning stations and communication equipment should be added to shipping routes and ports as needed. People's broadcasting stations in various provinces should broadcast disastrous weather forecasts issued by meteorological observatories on a regular basis, and increase the number of temporary broadcasts when necessary. Radio receiving stations in various places should conscientiously organize listening and relay the information to nearby areas. 3. People's governments at all levels and relevant departments should list the prevention of natural disasters as an important task of economic construction, and combine the reception, transmission, prevention, and rescue work of disastrous weather forecasts with the movement to increase production and practice thrift. This work should be arranged at certain meetings.

    中南行政委员会指示各地加强灾害性天气预报警报和预防工作
    【新华社武汉二十九日电】中南行政委员会指示各地加强灾害性天气预报、警报和预防工作。指示指出：几年来由于人民气象事业有很大发展，加之各地党政机关对气象工作的重视，及时采取有效措施，组织防御和抢救，在工业、农业、林业、渔盐业等各方面防止和减少了许多损失。去年十月三十一日海南岛地区发生十多年来未有的大风灾，事先根据气象台发布的大风预报做了准备，使灾害损失得到显著减轻。指示又指出：气象工作还是一门年轻的科学，我们的技术条件和设备，还不能满足各方面日益增长的要求，组织预防还缺乏经验，因而灾害损失还没有做到应有的减轻。为此，要求各地：一、加强灾害性的天气预报、警报发布工作。对大范围的灾害性天气预报、警报尽可能的提早发布，预先供给材料，以便有关单位作预防措施。二、做好天气预报、警报的传递和对灾害的防御、抢救工作。各地防风防汛等机构应及时检查灾害性天气预报、警报的传递情况和使用效果。为传递统一，沿江、沿海及沿湖暴风警报站，统一由航运或水产等有关部门建立，各级气象机构予以协助。在航线和港埠，应根据需要增添暴风警报站和通讯设备。各省人民广播电台对于气象台发布的灾害性天气应定时广播，必要时得增加临时广播次数。各地广播收音站应认真组织收听，并向临近地区进行传达。三、各级人民政府和有关部门应把防御自然灾害列为经济建设的重要工作之一，把灾害性天气预报的收听、传递和防御、抢救工作和增产节约运动结合起来，在一定的会议上布置这一工作。
