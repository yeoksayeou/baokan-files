    A Young Pioneer Squadron

    Wang Kekun solemnly swears under the flag of the Young Pioneers: Be ready, to struggle for the cause of building the motherland and for the realization of Chairman Mao's great ideals!
    They are in the reading room of the Beijing "Children's Home."
    They received a letter from a squadron of the Soviet Young Pioneers, the Sixth Grade Class B of School No. 367 on Rilodunskaya Street in Leningrad, stating that the activity content of one of their Young Pioneer Day events was "China and the Soviet Union will always be brothers," and they requested a reply. They replied by introducing their happy learning life.
    Members who love painting participate in art groups and often go outside to paint beautiful scenery. Members of the dance group are intensifying their dance practice, preparing to participate in the activities of their holiday - "June 1st" International Children's Day.
    They are in self-study class.
    When they visited the state-owned Shuangqiao Farm, they saw that even planting potatoes used machines. Some members said: In the future, all agricultural production in our motherland will use machines, how wonderful that would be!
    Cai Yuanyuan was invited to be an actor in the movie "Chicken Feather Letter," which delayed some of his studies. The classmates helped him make up the lessons.
    They are visiting the state-owned Beijing First Cotton Textile Factory, which is about to officially start production. Wang Huijin said happily: "The factory is really good, when I grow up, I will come here to work."
    We must exercise our bodies well to prepare to serve the motherland in the future.
    Plant flowers and vegetables, and build a fence to protect them.

    一个少年先锋队的中队
    中国少年先锋队北京市东四区第一中心小学第一中队，全队共有四十二名队员。他们遵照毛主席“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，过着愉快的学习生活。摄影：本报　张力
    王克昆在庄严的队旗下宣誓：准备着，为建设祖国的事业，为实现毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗！
    他们在北京市“少年之家”的阅览室里。
    他们收到苏联少年先锋队，列宁格勒里洛敦斯卡雅街第三六七学校六年级乙班的一个中队的来信，说有一次过队日的活动内容是“中苏永久是弟兄”，并要求他们回信。他们就回信介绍了幸福的学习生活。
    爱好绘画的队员，参加美术小组，经常到校外去画美丽的风景。舞蹈小组的队员在加紧练习舞蹈，准备参加自己的节日——“六一”国际儿童节的活动。
    他们在自习课上。
    他们在参观国营双桥农场的时候，看到种土豆也用机器。有的队员说：将来咱们祖国的农业生产样样都用机器，那多么好呀！
    蔡元元被请去做电影“鸡毛信”的演员，耽误了一些功课，同学们帮助他补习。
    他们参观就要正式开工生产的国营北京第一棉纺织厂。王慧金高兴地说：“工厂里真好，等我长大了也到这里来工作。”
    要把身体锻炼好，准备将来为祖国服务。
    种花又种菜，编个篱笆来保护它。
