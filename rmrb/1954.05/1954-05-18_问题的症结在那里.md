The Crux of the Matter
By our correspondents Li Zhuang and Du Bo
Beginning today (the 17th), the discussion of the Indochina issue has moved into closed sessions; the open debate on the Korean issue also appears to be coming to an end. In the three weeks of the Geneva Conference, the true face of the forces, represented by the United States, that are maintaining tension in Asia and the world and expanding the war has been exposed. They have been condemned by world opinion and suffered unexpected setbacks. At the meeting on the 14th to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina, Foreign Minister Molotov made new efforts, suggesting a ceasefire in Indochina under the supervision of a neutral nations commission, and that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference to discuss Indochina jointly guarantee the implementation of the agreement. This moved the conference a step further towards success and dealt a heavy blow to the American imperialists who were sabotaging the conference and spreading pessimism.

So, what major obstacles remain to be overcome in the decision-making stage of the Geneva Conference? What is the crux of the Korean and Indochina issues?

The "red light" currently facing the Korean issue is still Dulles' absurd assertion that the United Nations forces (i.e., the US military) cannot withdraw and that the Korean elections must be supervised by the United Nations (i.e., the United States). Everyone knows that only the withdrawal of foreign troops, allowing elections to be held in Korea without any external coercion, can lead to truly free elections and achieve genuine unification. The Western bourgeois press does not deny that the reason the United States will not withdraw its troops is that it knows that without the bayonets of the US military, Syngman Rhee would not be able to tyrannize the South Korean people. Since the United Nations organization has been defiled by the United States and become a belligerent party, the so-called United Nations supervision of elections has long been synonymous with "American supervision."

Many European and American newspapers have revealed that the United States intends not only to use the method of United Nations supervision of "elections" to hinder the resolution of the Korean issue, but also to use this method to delay the negotiations on the Indochina issue. According to the "New York Herald Tribune": "The United States and its Western allies have long estimated that Ho Chi Minh is far more popular than Bao Dai in Vietnam, and therefore Ho Chi Minh will certainly win in the elections." The French "News" more frankly stated: "Obviously, the government hopes that this election will not be held in a timely manner, because under the most perfect legal conditions, the danger of the Viet Minh's victory due to its political and psychological strength is enormous."

Speaking of the Indochina issue, observers here have noted that, due to the growing pressure from the French people, Bidault's tone in his speech on the 14th had changed somewhat. For example, he vaguely indicated that he could consider the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In his speech, he not only talked about a military ceasefire, but also touched upon some political issues. However, in Bidault's three speeches, he consistently repeated the platitudes that the Vietnam War is a "civil war," that the Bao Dai regime is the "only legitimate government" of Vietnam, and that Laos and Cambodia are already "independent" members of the French Union, and that the war there is the result of "Viet Minh aggression." The obvious conspiracy here is that he still does not want to face the interests and aspirations of the Indochinese people for national independence, and is unwilling to reach an agreement on the basis of equality, reason, and reality. Look, Bidault said that Vietnam's "independence" could be given to Bao Dai soon, and the problems of Cambodia and Laos were even "simpler," that there were no people and governments resisting, and that the problem would be solved as soon as the "Viet Minh" withdrew its troops.... In this way, he self-deceivingly dismissed such a major issue as the restoration of peace in Indochina with a light stroke. In addition, regarding free elections, Bidault, as revealed in the newspapers, is most afraid that genuine free elections will lead to the collapse of the unpopular Bao Dai government.

Bidault said in the first sentence of his third speech:
"The French delegation has studied Mr. Pham Van Dong's proposals with great attention." He should also study Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the 14th with great attention, which stated: "At this Geneva Conference, France faces a major issue: which path will France choose in Indochina? One path is to continue the Indochina war, thereby expanding the war for the sake of foreign aggression plans, which is of no benefit to France's national interests. The other path is to negotiate, first with the Vietnamese people, and to continue efforts in this direction to ensure a rapid ceasefire and the establishment of peace in Indochina. Taking this path can lead to mutual understanding between France and the Indochinese people and establish friendly relations between them. The Geneva Conference should do its best to promote such a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue."

Whether it is the Korean issue or the Indochina issue, the key at present is that the Western reactionary forces headed by the United States are doing everything possible to sabotage the Geneva Conference. The countercurrent is still surging.

Regarding the negotiations on the Korean issue, there are reports that "the US delegation is considering telling the communists that unless they agree to the United Nations supervising the Korean elections, it is unlikely that further Korean meetings will be held" (Reuters). On the Indochina issue, in the words of the Paris "Liberation": the race between ceasefire and expanding the war is in full swing. The Paris authorities have been meeting for days to "study the possibility of reinforcing the Indochina Expeditionary Force," and at the same time have asked the United States for the second time to directly intervene in Indochina to "internationalize" this "dirty war." In Washington, Paris, and Geneva, US and French officials have been in frequent contact for behind-the-scenes negotiations. On the one hand, the United States is trying its best to win over Britain and France to form a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc; on the other hand, it is releasing the air that even if Britain and France refuse to "cooperate," as long as the three puppet states of Indochina make a request, it will directly intervene. That is to say, the United States is actively carrying out a "dual-pronged" conspiracy to suppress the people of Southeast Asia and seize control of Indochina from France. However, in any case, the active steps taken by Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union have paved the way for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue and have received unanimous support from public opinion. The peace-loving people of all countries, especially the French people, urgently demand the early restoration of peace in Indochina. This force cannot be ignored. The current serious task of the peace-loving people of all countries is to continue to combat the US sabotage conspiracy in order to ensure that the Geneva Conference reaches an agreement that meets the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries.

### 问题的症结在那里

    问题的症结在那里
    本报记者　李庄　杜波
    从今天（十七日）起，印度支那问题的讨论转入了秘密会议；朝鲜问题的公开辩论似乎也将结束了。在三个星期的日内瓦会议上，以美国为代表的保持亚洲和世界紧张局势、扩大战争的势力的原形被暴露了，在世界舆论面前受到了谴责并遭到了没有料到的挫折。在十四日讨论恢复印度支那和平的会议上，莫洛托夫外长作了新的努力，建议在中立国委员会监督下实现印度支那的停战，并由参加日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的各国共同保证协议的实施，使会议又向成功的路上前进了一步，给了破坏会议和散布悲观空气的美帝国主义者一个沉重的打击。
    那么，在今后的日内瓦会议决定阶段上还有那些重大的障碍要克服呢？朝鲜和印度支那问题的症结在那里呢？
    今天朝鲜问题所面对的“红灯”还是杜勒斯的联合国军（即美军）不能撤退，朝鲜选举必须由联合国（即美国）监督进行的荒谬主张。谁都知道，只有外国军队撤退，使朝鲜不受任何外力压迫之下进行选举，才是真正的自由选举，才能达到真正的统一。西方资产阶级的报纸并不否认，美国所以不撤兵，在于它知道没有美军的刺刀，李承晚根本就不可能坐在南朝鲜人民的头上行凶。由于联合国这个组织受到美国的奸污而成了交战国的一方，所谓联合国的监督选举，谁都知道早已成了“美国监督”的代名词。
    不少欧美报纸透露：美国不仅要用联合国监督“选举”的方法来阻碍朝鲜问题的解决，而且还准备用这种方法拖延印度支那问题的谈判。据“纽约先驱论坛报”透露：“美国和西方盟邦早经估计到，在越南，胡志明是远比保大得人心的，因而在选举中胡志明一定获胜。”法国“新闻报”更率直地说：“显然，政府希望这种选举不必及时举行，因为在最完善的合法条件下，由于越盟的政治力量和它的心理力量，越盟取得胜利的危险性是巨大的。”
    说到印度支那问题，这里的观察家们注意到，皮杜尔由于法国人民日益增长的压力，在十四日的发言口气已有某些改变。例如，他含糊地表示可以考虑越南民主共和国的建议。他在发言中不只谈到军事停战，多少地谈到了一些政治问题。但是在皮杜尔三次发言中，还始终贯串着越南战争是“内战”，保大政权是越南“唯一合法的政府”，寮国和高棉是早已“独立”了的法兰西联邦成员，那里的战争是“越盟侵略”的结果等滥调。这里的显而易见的阴谋，就是还不想正视印度支那人民的利益和争取民族独立的愿望，还不愿在平等、合理和现实的原则下，达成协议。你看，皮杜尔说越南的“独立”很快就可以给保大了，高棉和寮国的问题更“简单”，那里根本没有什么抗战的人民和政府，只要“越盟”撤了兵就解决了……。这样他就自欺欺人地把有关恢复印度支那和平的这样重大的问题，轻轻一笔勾销了。另外，关于自由选举，皮杜尔正如报纸上所透露的，也最害怕真正的自由选举会使不得人心的保大政府垮台。
    皮杜尔在他第三次发言中的第一句话就说：
  “法国代表团已经以十分的注意研究过范文同的建议”。他似乎还应该以十分注意来研究一下莫洛托夫外长十四日的讲话，其中说：“在这次日内瓦会议上，法国面临着一项重大问题：法国在印度支那选择什么道路。一条道路是继续进行印度支那战争，从而为了外国的侵略计划而扩大战争，它对法国的民族利益毫无好处。另一条道路是协商，首先是和越南人民协商，并向这一方面继续努力，以保证迅速停战和确立印度支那的和平。走这条道路，就可以使法国和印度支那人民互相谅解并在他们之间建立友好关系。日内瓦会议应该尽力促成印度支那问题得到这样的和平解决。”
    不论是朝鲜问题或印度支那问题，目前的关键是以美国为首的西方反动势力正在千方百计地破坏日内瓦会议。逆流还在激荡着。
    关于朝鲜问题的谈判，有消息说：“美国代表团正在考虑告诉共方，除非它们同意联合国监督朝鲜选举这个意见，继续举行朝鲜会议没有多大可能”（路透社）。在印度支那问题上，用巴黎“解放报”的话说：就是停战和扩大战争的竞赛正在激烈进行中。巴黎当局连日开会“研究增援印度支那远征军的可能性”，同时第二次要求美国直接干涉印度支那，把这场“肮脏战争”“国际化”。在华盛顿、巴黎、日内瓦，美法官方人士连日频繁接触，进行幕后谈判。美国一方面尽力拉拢英、法两国筹组东南亚侵略集团，一方面放出空气说，即使英法拒绝“合作”，只要印度支那三个傀儡国家提出要求，它也要直接干涉。这就是说，美国正在积极进行镇压东南亚人民，并从法国手中夺取印度支那控制权的“一箭双雕”的阴谋计划。但是，无论如何，越、中、苏所采取的积极步骤，已为和平解决印度支那问题铺平了道路，并得到公众舆论的一致支持。各国爱好和平的人民，特别是法国人民，迫切要求早日恢复印度支那的和平，这种力量是不能忽视的。各国爱好和平人民当前的严重任务，就是继续打击美国的破坏阴谋活动，以保证日内瓦会议取得符合各国人民和平愿望的协议。
