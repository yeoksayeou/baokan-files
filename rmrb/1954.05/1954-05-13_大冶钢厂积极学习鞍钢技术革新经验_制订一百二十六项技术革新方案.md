   Daye Steel Plant Actively Learns from Anshan Iron and Steel's Technical Innovation Experience
    Formulates 126 Technical Innovation Plans
    Daye Steel Plant is actively learning from Anshan Iron and Steel's technical innovation experience. Each workshop has formulated 126 technical innovation plans and is conducting in-depth mobilization among all employees. At a plant-wide mobilization meeting on the 11th, the plant also rewarded nine units, including the Bessemer furnace section, and thirteen employees who had made achievements in technical innovation in the past, and announced specific measures for promoting technical innovation. The plant also held a technical innovation exhibition.
    The original equipment of Daye Steel Plant was very backward, resulting in three long-term situations in production: low labor productivity, hardship for workers, and high costs. The innovation plans this time were all proposed by the employees in response to the key production issues in their respective units. The open hearth workshop plans to increase the furnace charge and add several auxiliary equipment, which can increase production by 25% to 30% and reduce costs by 10%. The iron smelting workshop plans to change all existing manual charging to semi-mechanized, which can save 42 workers per day and eliminate the risk of gas poisoning for raw material workers. The heat treatment workshop plans to experiment with using sandblasting machines to replace sulfuric acid in removing iron oxide scale from steel, so that pickling workers will no longer be harmed by sulfuric acid. The rolling mill workshop, which has achieved success in learning from Anshan Iron and Steel's technical innovation experience, plans to apply the pass design to roll various types of steel, and further learn from Anshan Iron and Steel's automatic steel turner, steel tapping machine, and a total of thirteen items, which can save 69 workers per day and make the workshop's production "basically fully mechanized."
    After studying the general line, the employees of Daye Steel Plant are very enthusiastic about production innovation. Since the beginning of this year, the rolling mill workshop first successfully trial-produced the reverse pass and reverse vertical pass, setting an example of technical innovation in the plant. Following closely, a pair of small furnaces in the Bessemer furnace section increased the average daily smelting from 77 heats in December last year to an average of 103 heats in April, guaranteeing a 43% increase in production compared to the original annual state plan. The repair workshop promoted the advanced experience of "surface hardening," which extended the service life of various gears by more than three times and saved 2.5 billion yuan annually. However, because the leading cadres of Daye Steel Plant and some workshops did not sufficiently recognize the great significance of mass technical innovation in our country's construction, they adopted a cold attitude towards the masses' suggestions for improving production, failing to process, respond to, or negatively denying them for a long time. This hindered the development of technical innovation in the plant. In this study of Anshan Iron and Steel's experience, the plant leadership criticized these erroneous attitudes, convened various forums with advanced producers, technical personnel, veteran technicians, and young workers to solicit opinions, conducted self-criticism, and educated everyone to learn from the innovation spirit of Zhang Mingshan and Wang Chonglun in order to carry out the technical innovation movement in an organized and planned manner. The plant administration also made specific provisions on the trial time, expenses, and resolution of personnel reductions caused by new technologies in promoting technical innovation. As a result, the employees expressed their eagerness to participate in the innovation movement and put forward many technical suggestions that they had been researching for a long time.
    The above-mentioned 126 technical innovation plans of Daye Steel Plant will mostly be implemented by professional teams before August, and some have already begun to be implemented. The rolling mill workshop has used the reverse pass to roll 16mm and 19mm steel bars, increasing production by 10%. The heat treatment workshop has completed the sandblasting machine and will conduct trials soon. (Reported by our Central and Southern China reporter station)

    大冶钢厂积极学习鞍钢技术革新经验
    制订一百二十六项技术革新方案
    大冶钢厂积极学习鞍钢技术革新经验，已由各车间制订出一百二十六项技术革新方案，并向全体职工进行深入动员。在十一日的全厂动员大会上，该厂还奖励了过去革新技术有成绩的贝氏炉工段等九个单位与十三名职工，公布了推行技术革新的具体办法。该厂还同时举办了技术革新展览会。
    大冶钢厂原有的设备很落后，使生产上长期存在三个情况：劳动生产率低、工人苦、成本高。这次的革新方案都是职工们针对本单位的生产关键提出来的。平炉车间准备提高装炉量，并增加若干附属设备，可以使生产提高百分之二十五至三十，成本降低百分之十，炼铁车间准备将现有的全部人工上料改为半机械化的，每天可以节省人工四十二名，并使原料工人免除煤气中毒的危险。热处理车间准备试验用喷砂机代替硫酸清除钢材的氧化铁皮，使酸洗工人再不受硫酸的伤害。学习鞍钢技术革新经验有成绩的轧钢车间，准备将围盘应用来轧制各种钢材，并进一步学习鞍钢的自动翻钢机、出钢机等一共十三项，每天可节省六十九个人工，并使车间的生产作到“基本上全部机械化”。
    大冶钢厂职工在学习总路线后，对革新生产是非常热情的。今年开年以来，轧钢车间首先试制反围盘与反立围盘成功，在本厂树立了技术革新的榜样。紧跟着贝氏炉工段的一对小炉子由去年十二月平均日炼七十七炉提高到四月份平均日炼一百零三炉，保证比原有全年国家计划增产百分之四十三。修造车间推广“表面淬火”先进经验，使各种牙轮的使用期限延长三倍以上，每年可节省二十五亿元。但是由于大冶钢厂与某些车间领导干部对群众性的技术革新在我国建设中的重大意义认识不够，对群众改进生产的建议采取冷淡态度，长期不处理、答复或消极地加以否定。这就阻碍了该厂技术革新的开展。在这次学习鞍钢的经验中，该厂领导上批判了这些错误态度，分头召集先进生产者、技术人员、老技工与青工等举行各种座谈会，征求意见，作了自我检讨，并教育大家学习张明山、王崇伦的革新精神，以求有组织、有计划地展开技术革新运动。该厂行政上也同时对推行技术革新的试验时间、费用与解决因新技术而引起的人员缩减等具体问题作了规定。这样一来，职工们都纷纷表示出要热烈参加革新运动的热切愿望，并提出许多自己研究了很久的技术建议。
    上述大冶钢厂的一百二十六项技术革新方案，绝大多数都将在八月以前由专业小组负责加以实现，有的现已开始施行。轧钢车间已将反围盘用来轧制十六公厘与十九公厘的钢条，提高了产量百分之十。热处理车间已将喷砂机作好了，最近就要进行试验。（本报中南记者站）
