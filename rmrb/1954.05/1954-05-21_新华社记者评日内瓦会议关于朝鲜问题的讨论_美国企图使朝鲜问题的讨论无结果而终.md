Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on Geneva Conference Discussion on the Korean Issue
The United States Attempts to Make the Discussion on the Korean Issue End Without Result

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 19th (By our special correspondent Chen Shi-wu) The discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference has been stalled for nearly a week, and it is still unknown when discussions can resume. Western press reports reveal that at the secret meeting on the Indochina issue on the 18th, Molotov suggested discussing the Korean issue on the 19th, but US representative Smith took the lead in disagreeing.

It is no secret in Geneva that the US delegation is now particularly unenthusiastic about discussing the Korean issue and hopes to end the discussion on the Korean issue as soon as possible. American journalists have also asserted that since the method of holding so-called "free elections" in Korea under the supervision of the United Nations has been rejected, the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference will soon end without any result. The US side neither wants to talk about withdrawing foreign troops from Korea nor avoids touching on the issue of all countries jointly guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea, although Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov have already stated that China and the Soviet Union are willing to undertake this international guarantee obligation.

As early as the beginning of the Geneva Conference, Dulles quickly and unequivocally rejected Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal. It is said that some of the United States' allies, however, considered the complete rejection of Nam Il's proposal to be "stupid" and "dangerous," and they were "concerned that the only detailed proposal on the unification of Korea to date came from a communist." If one does not discuss Nam Il's proposal and cannot come up with any concrete proposals of one's own, it is tantamount to admitting that one does not want to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Therefore, in the past week or so, representatives of the invading countries have been engaged in intense activities outside the meeting room in order to formulate a proposal to counter Nam Il's proposal. An Associated Press reporter reported on the 18th that some of the United States' allies are "still trying to devise a plan to hold all-Korean elections under UN supervision. They don't think there is much hope that the Communists will accept this plan. But some participating countries believe that, from a propaganda point of view, it is best to put forward a plan that looks completely fair to the public."

The meeting of the sixteen countries that invaded Korea and the smaller meeting of the seven countries have been held many times, and it seems that there are no definite results. Some representatives complained that drafting such a plan, which is purely to deceive world public opinion, is becoming an increasingly thankless task. First of all, this plan is not up to the United States's expectations. "New York Times" reporter Hamilton reported that one of the main dissatisfactions of the United States with some of its allies is because they suggested holding all-Korean elections under the supervision of the United Nations. The United States lacks so much confidence in the Syngman Rhee regime that it feels that all-Korean elections under UN supervision are too much of a risk. Under the instructions of the United States, Syngman Rhee is making one absurd demand after another as a prerequisite for all-Korean elections. It seems that this plan cannot be drafted until representatives of some Western countries can convince Smith that this is strategically necessary.

The journalists of the Western bourgeois newspapers here also suspect that even if such a plan is finally made, its "propaganda" value will be completely lost due to the recent "election" in South Korea. Syngman Rhee is showing the world what a so-called "free election" under the supervision of the United Nations is all about.

It is reported that on May 20, the third so-called "National Assembly" election since 1948 will be held in South Korea. According to a report by Agence France-Presse on the 14th, representatives of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" declared that they would "observe" this election and submit a report to the United Nations General Assembly. Agence France-Presse said that this election would be the kind of "election under UN supervision" proposed at the Geneva Conference. It can be predicted that, like the previous two times, this committee will declare in its report to the United Nations this time that the election is "truly free." But in fact, like the previous two times, this election is also being conducted under the terror and persecution of the Syngman Rhee clique. A few examples are enough. Reuters reported on the 11th that the police under Syngman Rhee were putting pressure on voters to support only the candidates of Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party." A Western diplomat in Seoul also admitted that the authorities were sending police, especially in rural areas, to obstruct the campaign activities of opposition candidates. A person could be sentenced to death simply for accusing the Syngman Rhee government of corruption. The Associated Press reported on May 12 that Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party" purged 100 so-called "rebels" because "they disobeyed orders and ran for the position of South Korean Member of Parliament. These purged people were preparing to oppose candidates supported by Lee (Syngman Rhee) in the May 20 election." Reuters reported that a South Korean who had campaigned for candidates of parties opposed to Syngman Rhee was beaten to death in a police station in Busan. A candidate in Busan "accused a group of ruffians of seriously injuring many of his campaign promoters and destroying his loudspeakers." "People from the opposition to Syngman Rhee often accuse the police of interfering in their campaign activities."

These reports are not news to those who are familiar with the situation of the 1948 and 1950 South Korean "National Assembly" elections. They are just another proof that in elections held under the supervision or "observation" of the United Nations, the only ones who are truly free are the Syngman Rhee clique and the secret agents, police, and terrorists it hires. In the face of such facts, it is clearly impossible to try to convince people that only under the supervision of the United Nations can there be truly free elections.

Observers here have also noticed the news that US Secretary of Defense Wilson and former commander of the US Eighth Army in Korea, Van Fleet, are busy in Korea. Wilson openly declared in Seoul that any statement about the Americans withdrawing from Korea "is pure fantasy." According to a broadcast from Tokyo Radio, Wilson admitted that he was trying to find ways and means to make Korea a part of the US so-called "defense plan." An American economist, Benson, has unequivocally stated that maintaining tensions in Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, etc., and using Asians to fight Asians, "can drive up commodity prices, increase employment, and enable the Republican Party to win the congressional elections." All of this casts a deep shadow on the discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference.

Naturally, progressive public opinion has not lost confidence in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The broad masses of people around the world, especially the people of Asia, eagerly hope that the Korean armistice will be stabilized and that the Korean people's desire for peace, independence, unification, and democracy will be fulfilled. The delegations of the peaceful and democratic countries participating in the Geneva Conference are still relentlessly pursuing their efforts to reach an agreement on issues of urgent importance in the Korean situation. The rigid policies of Dulles-Smith are causing increasingly widespread dissatisfaction. The course of the situation cannot be determined by a few people in Washington.

    新华社记者评日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    美国企图使朝鲜问题的讨论无结果而终
    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】本社特派记者陈适五报道：日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，已经被搁置了将近一个星期，现在还不知道什么时候能恢复讨论。西方报界透露的消息说，在十八日关于印度支那问题的秘密会议上，莫洛托夫曾经建议在十九日讨论朝鲜问题，但是美国代表史密斯带头表示不同意。
    在日内瓦这已不是秘密：美国代表团现在对于讨论朝鲜问题特别不热心，并且希望尽快结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论。美国的记者们也扬言，由于在联合国监督之下在朝鲜举行所谓“自由选举”的办法被拒绝，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论不久将以毫无结果而告终。美国方面既不想谈从朝鲜撤退外国军队，也避免触及有关各国共同保证朝鲜的和平发展的问题，虽然周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长早已先后表示中苏两国愿意承担这种国际保证的义务。
    还在日内瓦会议开始之初，杜勒斯就迅速地不留余地地拒绝了南日外务相的建议。据说，美国的某些盟国却认为完全拒绝南日的建议是“愚蠢的”、“危险的”，他们“由于至今为止关于统一朝鲜的唯一详细的建议案是来自一个共产党人而感到忧虑”。如果不讨论南日建议而自己又提不出任何具体建议，那就等于承认自己不想和平解决朝鲜问题。因此，在过去一个多星期中，侵朝国家的代表们在会议室外进行了紧张的活动，以便拟订出一个与南日建议相抗衡的建议来。美联社记者在十八日报道说：美国的一些盟国还“正在设法拟出一个在联合国监督之下举行全朝鲜选举的计划。他们认为要共产党接受这个计划是没有多大希望的。但一些参与国认为，从宣传的观点出发，最好还是提出一个在公众看来是完全公平的计划。”
    侵略朝鲜的十六国会议和更小范围的七国会议，已开过好多次了，看来似乎还没有什么确定的结果。有些代表们抱怨：拟订这样一个纯粹是为了欺骗世界舆论的计划，正在越来越成为一件吃力不讨好的工作。首先，这个计划还不如美国的意。“纽约时报”记者汉密尔顿报道说，美国对其某些盟国的主要不满之一，就是因为它们建议在联合国监督之下举行全朝鲜选举。美国对于李承晚政权是如此缺乏信心，以至于觉得联合国监督下的全朝鲜选举都未免是一种太大的冒险。在美国的授意之下，李承晚正在提出一个又一个荒唐的要求，来作为全朝鲜选举的先决条件。看样子在某些西方国家的代表团能够说服史密斯相信这是策略上有必要以前，这个计划是拟订不出来的。
    这里的西方国家资产阶级报纸的记者们也怀疑，即使这样的一个计划终于作了出来，它的“宣传”价值也将因为最近南朝鲜的“竞选”而完全丧失。李承晚正在表演给全世界看，所谓在联合国监督之下举行的“自由选举”究竟是怎么回事。
    据报道，五月二十日将要在南朝鲜举行从一九四八年以来的第三次所谓“国会”的选举。据法新社在十四日报道，“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的代表宣称，他们将对这次选举进行“观察”，并向联合国大会提出报告。法新社说，这种选举将就是在日内瓦会议上提出的那种“联合国监督下的选举”。可以预料，像前两次一样，这个委员会这次也将在它给联合国的报告里宣称，选举是“真正自由”的。但是事实上，像前两次一样，这次选举也是在李承晚集团的恐怖和迫害下进行的。举几个例子就够了。路透社在十一日报道说，李承晚指挥下的警察对选民施用压力，要他们只支持李承晚的“自由党”的候选人。在汉城的一名西方外交人士也承认，当局正派出警察，尤其在乡间地区，去阻挠反对党候选人的竞选活动。有一个人仅仅因为指责李承晚政府腐败，就可能被处死刑。美联社在五月十二日报道说，李承晚的“自由党”清洗了所谓“反叛分子”一百人，因为“他们不服从命令而竞选南朝鲜议员职位。这些被清洗的人是准备在五月二十日选举中反对李（承晚）所支持的候选人的。”路透社报道说，曾经为反对李承晚的政党的候选人竞选的一名南朝鲜人，被毒打后死在釜山的警察局里。在釜山的一名竞选人“指责一批无赖曾严重地打伤他的许多竞选宣传员并破坏他的播音器”。“反对李承晚派的人员经常控告警察干涉他们的竞选活动”。
    这些报道对于熟悉一九四八年和一九五零年南朝鲜“国会”选举情形的人来说，已经不是什么新闻。它们只是又一次证明了：在联合国监督或“观察”下举行的选举中真正有自由的只是李承晚集团和它所雇佣的特务、警察和恐怖分子。在这样的事实面前，企图使人相信只有在联合国监督之下才有真正的自由选举，显然是办不到的事情。
    这里的观察家也注意到这样的消息：美国国防部长威尔逊和侵略朝鲜美军第八军前军长范佛里特正在朝鲜忙得不亦乐乎。威尔逊在汉城公开宣称，任何关于美国人将从朝鲜撤退的说法，“都是纯粹的空想”。据东京电台广播说，威尔逊承认他正试图觅取途径与方法，来使朝鲜成为美国的所谓“防御计划”的一部分。美国的一个经济学家本逊已经毫不含糊地说，在台湾、朝鲜、菲律宾等地保持紧张局势和用亚洲人打亚洲人，“就可以使商品价格高涨，增加就业，并且可以使共和党在国会选举中获胜。”所有这些，都为日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论投下深深的阴影。
    自然，进步舆论并没有对朝鲜问题的和平解决失去信心。广大的世界人民，特别是亚洲人民热切地希望朝鲜停战得到稳定，朝鲜人民的和平、独立、统一和民主的愿望得到满足。参加日内瓦会议的和平民主国家的代表团，仍毫不松弛其努力，以期就朝鲜局势中具有迫切重要性的问题达成协议。杜勒斯—史密斯的僵硬政策正引起愈来愈广泛的不满。时局的进程并不是华盛顿的少数人所能决定的。
