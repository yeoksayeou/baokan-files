Learning from the Soviet Union's Experience in Compiling the First Five-Year Plan
Li Yuheng

Socialist society must carry out construction in a planned way. Our country's first Five-Year Plan is a decisive key to carrying out socialist construction. In order to compile and realize our country's first Five-Year Plan, we should learn from the Soviet Union's experience in compiling various Five-Year Plans, especially the experience of the Soviet Union in compiling the first Five-Year Plan, and fully consider our country's specific conditions, so as to effectively apply the Soviet Union's experience to our country's practice of building socialism.

The Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan was changed ten times in the process of compilation and lasted four years (1925-1929). At that time, because there was no experience and a lack of complete statistical data, some class enemies tried their best to play a destructive role in practical work with their bourgeois views and methods. It was not until the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued instructions on formulating the Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development in December 1927 that the problem was solved. In this instruction, the development speed and proportional relationship of the national economic plan were correctly stipulated. According to this instruction, the State Planning Commission formulated instructions on compilation methods for the planning organs of various People's Commissariats and localities, and re-determined the compilation procedures for the Five-Year Plan. At the same time, the Supreme Council of National Economy of the Soviet Union further formulated the outline of the plan for the most important departments of capital construction and transformation of the national economy, formulated the outline figures for increasing material production and investment changes, stipulated the basic policies on labor, finance and other aspects, and issued instructions on regional economic development. Among these series of instructions, the instructions on compiling industrial, agricultural and capital construction plans are of particular significance.

In the instructions on compiling the industrial plan, a comprehensive indicator system was stipulated, the classification of various industrial sectors producing means of production and producing consumer goods was adjusted, the catalog of major industrial products was determined, and the unified planning unit related to production volume and production scale in constant prices, current prices and physical terms was stipulated. In this instruction, the clear goal of the comprehensive development of the metallurgical industry and the specific tasks of each department within the industry were particularly pointed out. Detailed analysis was made of the machine manufacturing industry, the development of new factories, the organization of labor and the rationalization of production, and the specialization and collaboration of various enterprises. The instructions were issued by region, which particularly improved the realism of the instructions. The instructions on the power industry included the calculation and investigation of power resources, the calculation of the capacity and output of various power stations, the study of the content of power consumption and the cost of power generation, and stipulated that the stages of compilation of the plan should be: (1) Accurately calculate the actual power consumption of various departments of the national economy in five years; (2) Correctly allocate power resources by region; (3) Determine the methods and specific forms of supplying electricity for general consumption; (4) Determine the methods of rationally allocating regional unified power grids and the progress plan for completing such power grids.

In the instructions on compiling the agricultural plan, many measures were stipulated to prepare for the large-scale transition to collective agriculture, that is, to establish a large number of agricultural production cooperative organizations, increase the amount of agricultural product orders, increase the supply of machines and fertilizers, and the preferential conditions for state loans to collective agriculture, etc.; Secondly, while proposing various agricultural technical organization measures, the sowing area of various crops and regions, the crop ratio at the end of the planning period, the total output and unit area yield of various crops, the quota of livestock products, and the content of the grain feed balance sheet were stipulated.

In the instructions on compiling the capital construction plan, planners were required to consider the comprehensive problems in the five-year construction. These comprehensive problems are: accurately calculating the scope of capital construction, considering the interests of the national economy and national defense, allocating investment by department and region, considering the balance between the investment plan and the material and technical supply plan, cadre training, investment effectiveness, and the organization of construction work. The instructions also required that specific plans for each department and construction object should have a scientific technical and economic basis, and that the latest scientific and technological achievements should be used as the basis for design.

The above-mentioned instructions laid the theoretical and methodological foundation for the scientific compilation of long-term plans. According to these instructions, the national planning agency made a rough calculation of all resources at the beginning of the planning period, made a scientific analysis of the labor productivity and possible growth rate of production volume in the main departments of the national economy, analyzed the scale of accumulation and its sources, and formulated a brief chart of the distribution and redistribution of national income. Analyzing the socio-economic situation at the beginning of the planning period is one of the most important preparatory work for compiling long-term plans. Stalin taught us: If we do not conduct serious and in-depth research on the existing level of national economic development, the interrelationship between various economic components and classes in the country, do not calculate the material prerequisites, labor reserves and natural resources necessary for construction, do not discover new potentials, and do not analyze the balance and fragile links in the national economy, it is impossible to formulate a scientific long-term plan.

After basically clarifying material resources, labor resources and financial resources, the Soviet State Planning Commission restarted the compilation work of the plan. One of the problems that needed to be solved at that time was from which link should the compilation of the plan begin?

According to the Marxist-Leninist principle of the priority growth of the means of production, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stipulated that the central link of the Five-Year Plan was the development of heavy industry. According to this principle, the compilation of the plan should start from heavy industry, with it as the core, to determine a series of other related indicators. When compiling the heavy industry plan, the machine manufacturing industry was taken as the core, and the production volume of the iron and steel sector was determined according to the needs of the machine manufacturing industry and other sectors. Both the machine manufacturing industry and the iron and steel industry need a large amount of power, so after the production volume of these two sectors is determined, the development scale of the power industry can be roughly determined. The power development problem is related to the fuel mining problem, so the determination of the power industry development scale will inevitably become an important basis for compiling the fuel mining plan. The expansion of the production of machinery, iron and steel, electricity, and fuel sectors, in addition to relying on the excavation of the potential of existing enterprises, must also carry out capital construction. The determination of the amount of capital construction in the above-mentioned major sectors can roughly stipulate the production volume of the building materials sector. In this way, starting from the production plan of the core of heavy industry - the machine manufacturing industry, one link after another can gradually determine the plan within the heavy industry sector.

While developing heavy industry, light industry should be developed accordingly. After determining the heavy industry plan, the Soviet State Planning Commission at that time determined the light industry production plan from the proportional relationship between light and heavy industry, from the equipment capacity of light industry, from the interrelationship between various departments of light industry, from the development speed of various departments of light industry, from the possibility of supplying light industry with raw materials, and from the increase in residents' purchasing power.

The Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan stipulated that the average annual growth rate of the entire industry was 22 percent, the average annual growth rate of heavy industry was 27 percent, and light industry was 18 percent. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the proportion of industry in the total output value of the national economy increased from 48 percent at the beginning of the planning period to 70.7 percent.

Closely related to industrial production is agricultural production. The rapid increase in the industrial population and the scale of production of industrial consumer goods requires a corresponding increase in the grain and technical crops of the agricultural sector. At the beginning of the drafting of the Five-Year Plan, an analysis was made of the original development level of agriculture. This analysis pointed out that although the raw material crops had a great increase during the recovery period, they were still insufficient to supply the ever-increasing needs of industrial production. Another serious problem was the insufficient grain production. The analysis also pointed out that the rational solution to this problem must start from two aspects. One aspect is to improve farming methods (such as winter plowing, crop rotation, increasing draught animals, increasing machinery, etc.), and the other aspect is to strengthen the socialization part in agriculture. The plan stipulates that the cultivated area of the socialization part should be expanded by 13 percent. By the end of the planning period, the products of the entire socialization agricultural part accounted for 19.8 percent of the national agricultural products and 43 percent of the commodity grain.

The determination of the production volume plan of industry and agriculture laid the foundation for compiling the freight volume plan of the transportation sector. According to the production volume of various industrial and agricultural products and their transportation coefficient (the ratio of production volume to transportation volume, the production volume minus the local consumption volume is the transportation volume), the total transportation volume can be roughly determined. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that more than 10,000 kilometers of railways will be built.

On the basis of the industrial, agricultural, and transportation capacities that have been determined, a commodity circulation plan has been compiled. In order to alleviate the "commodity shortage" during the planning period, when compiling the plan, all factors that determine economic policy, such as prices, the growth rate of national income, taxation, loans, etc., were considered in relation to the balance of the market. According to the production capacity of consumer goods, the Five-Year Plan stipulates that the turnover of several major consumer goods should be increased by about one time. The composition of commodity supply has changed, and the proportion of large industrial products has increased from 70.5 percent to 75.9 percent. According to this change in the supply composition, plan the proportional relationship between the "organized" market and the "free" market, and stipulate that the former should be increased from 49.1 percent to 52.1 percent.

According to the development speed of industry, agriculture, and commerce, according to the growth speed of labor productivity, and according to the balance relationship between the wage fund and the commodity market fund, the residents' income growth plan can be finally determined. The Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan stipulated that the workers' monetary wages should increase by 47 percent during the five years, the actual wages should increase by 70.5 percent, and the total personal income should increase by 75 percent.

To carry out such a huge production construction, certain labor resources and financial resources must be available. The labor plan and the financial plan are formulated according to the production volume and the capital construction volume plan.

The determination of the number of workers is based on the growth rate of production volume on the one hand and the increase rate of labor productivity on the other hand. The number of engineering and technical personnel is determined according to the quota of engineering and technical personnel per thousand workers. At that time, it was stipulated that this quota was 120 in the heavy industry sector and 40 in the light industry sector. At that time, the Soviet Union also lacked engineering and technical personnel very much. The plan stipulated two measures to solve this problem. One aspect was to change the original training system of technical specialized talents in higher education, shorten the training period, and increase the number of graduates by 12 percent. The other aspect was to establish a large-scale worker technical training system to improve the technical proficiency of 1.3 million workers, so as to train a group of technical personnel from them.

One of the basic problems in compiling the financial plan is to correctly stipulate the proportional relationship between the various items of financial income and expenditure. At that time, the determination of various financial indicators was reflected through five aspects: comprehensive financial plan, national budget, departmental financial plan, credit plan, and cash revenue and expenditure plan of the National Bank. The comprehensive financial plan is compiled as a balancing document, and the national budget is a part of the comprehensive financial plan. The departmental financial plan is compiled on the basis of the national budget. The sources of all funds in the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan are as follows: the national budget accounted for 52 percent, the funds accumulated by state-owned enterprises accounted for 22 percent, the social insurance fund accounted for 10.7 percent, the accumulation of the banking system accounted for 7.7 percent, and the own funds accounted for 7.6 percent.

After the plans of the above-mentioned departments are completed, a general balance can be carried out. Through the adaptation of the relevant items of the material balance sheet, the labor balance sheet, and the financial balance sheet, the harmonious unity of the development of various departments of the national economy is guaranteed, so that a new proportional relationship is formed between the various processes of social expanded reproduction - production, distribution, circulation, consumption, and accumulation.

The above-mentioned planning procedure is determined by the objective internal connections of various departments of the national economy. In the actual process of social economy, this connection is multi-faceted and very complicated. In the initial stage of compiling the plan, only the leading connections can be grasped, and then gradually supplemented and revised.

The most basic problem in compiling the national economic plan is to correctly stipulate the development speed and proportional relationship. The former reflects the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, and the latter reflects the requirements of the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. According to the instructions of the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on formulating the Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan correctly solved this problem.

When formulating the most basic proportional relationship in the national economy - the proportional relationship between production and consumption, the planning staff considered the relative contradiction and unity of this proportional relationship, and stipulated the increase in the proportion of accumulation according to the basic tasks of the Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan. The proportion of accumulation in the national income increased from 19 percent to 33 percent, thus preparing material prerequisites for expanding production, and the expansion of production created conditions for expanding consumption in the future.

When formulating the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, the Soviet State Planning Commission specially studied the imbalance problem between industry and agriculture. This imbalance is manifested in: the imbalance between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products (that is, the "scissors difference" in the market), the imbalance between the needs and supply of technical crops and grain, and the imbalance between the existing number of rural labor force and the number that can be actually utilized economically. The Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan formulated a series of measures to eliminate the above-mentioned imbalances. These measures are: reducing the prices of industrial products on the basis of reducing the cost of industrial products, developing the production of grain and technical crops, realizing the cooperation of agriculture and improving the technical level, and trying to absorb small savings through the credit system.

When formulating the proportional relationship between light and heavy industry, the planning staff considered the priority growth of heavy industry, concentrated investment to develop heavy industry on the one hand, and also noted the danger of over-accumulating state funds in large constructions that must be used after many years. At the same time, in order to meet the increasing needs of residents, it was decided to develop light industry accordingly while focusing on the development of heavy industry. The Soviet Union's first Five-Year Plan decided that the proportional relationship between light and heavy industry was 53 (heavy industry) to 47 (light industry).

When compiling the capital construction plan, the Soviet State Planning Commission paid special attention to the relationship between the number of newly built industrial units and their completion time, as well as the proportional relationship between investment and utilization (that is, the utilization coefficient), and decided to invest the annual basic investment in a relatively limited number of new factories and selected existing enterprises to be rebuilt as much as possible.

On the issue of development speed, the Soviet State Planning Commission analyzed the growth of the four factors that determine the development speed during the planning period - labor consumption, labor productivity level, material consumption savings, and fixed asset and current asset storage - and decided not to require the accumulation of funds to reach the highest speed in a short period of time, but to ensure the fastest development speed in the long term on the basis of maintaining a certain proportional relationship between various parts of the national economy. This method of dealing with the relationship between the development speed and the planned relationship dialectically unified the two basic problems in compiling the national economic proportion.

    学习苏联编制第一个五年计划的经验
    李聿恒
    社会主义社会必须有计划地进行建设。我国第一个五年计划是进行社会主义建设的一个决定性的关键。为编制和实现我国第一个五年计划，我们应当学习苏联编制各个五年计划的经验，特别是学习苏联编制第一个五年计划的经验，并充分考虑到我国的具体情况，以便把苏联的经验有效地运用到我国建设社会主义的实践中去。
    苏联第一个五年计划在编制过程中曾改变了十次，历时四年（一九二五—一九二九年）。当时因为没有经验、缺乏完整的统计资料，而一些阶级异己分子，则极力以他们的资产阶级观点和方法在实际工作中起着破坏的作用。直到一九二七年十二月联共（布）第十五次代表大会发出了关于拟定国民经济五年计划的指示之后，才把问题解决了。在这个指令中，正确地规定了国民经济计划的发展速度和比例关系。根据这个指令，国家计划委员会，为各人民委员部及地方的计划机关，制订了编制方法的指示，重新确定了五年计划的编制程序。与此同时，苏联最高国民经济会议更制订了有关基本建设与改造国民经济最重要部门的计划纲要，制订了关于提高物质生产以及投资变动的轮廓数字，规定了关于劳动、财政以及其他方面的基本政策，发出了有关地区经济发展的指示。在这些一系列的指令中，关于编制工业、农业及基本建设计划方面的指令有特别重大的意义。
    在关于编制工业计划的指令中，规定了全面的指标体系，调整了生产生产资料部门与生产消费资料部门的各工业部门的分类，确定了工业主要产品的目录，规定了以不变价格、现行价格以及实物表现的有关生产量与生产规模的统一计划单位。在这个指令中，特别指出了金属工业全面发展的明确目标与该工业内部各部门的具体任务，对于机器制造业，对于新工厂的发展，对于劳动组织与生产合理化，对于各企业的专门化与协作化等问题，都作了详尽的分析。指令是按地区发出的，这就特别提高了指令的现实性。在关于电力工业的指示中，包含动力资源的计算和调查，计算各种电站的能力及产量，研究电力的消费内容及发电成本，并规定编制计划的阶段为：（一）精确计算国民经济各部门在五年内的电力实际消费量；（二）将电力资源按地区加以正确分配；（三）确定供应一般消费用电的方法和具体形式；（四）确定合理配置地区统一电力网的方法与完成这种电力网的进度计划。
    在关于编制农业计划的指示中，规定了准备大批向集体农业过渡的许多措施，即大量建立农业生产合作组织，增加农产品定购量，增加机器供应和肥料供应以及国家对集体农业贷款的优越条件等等；其次，在提出各种农业技术组织措施的同时，规定了各种作物和地区的播种面积，计划期末的作物比例，各种作物的总产量和单位面积产量，畜产品的定额以及谷物饲料平衡表的内容等等。
    在关于编制基本建设计划的指示中，要求计划工作者考虑五年建设中的综合性问题。这些综合性问题就是：精确计算基本建设范围，考虑国民经济和国防利益，按部门和地区的投资分配，考虑投资计划和物资技术供应计划的平衡关系，干部培养、投资效果以及建设工作的组织问题。指示并要求在编制各个部门及建设对象的具体计划时，要有科学的技术经济根据，要以最新的科学技术成就作为设计的基础。
    上述这些指令为科学的编制长期计划奠定了理论的和方法的基础。根据这些指令，国家计划机构对计划期初的全部资源进行了概略的计算，对国民经济主要部门的劳动生产率及生产量可能增长的速度作了科学分析，分析了积累的规模及其来源，并且制定了国民收入分配与再分配的简略图表。分析计划期初的社会经济情况，是编制长期计划的最重要的准备工作之一。斯大林教导我们：如果对于国民经济发展的现有水平，国内各种经济成分与各阶级的相互关系，不做认真的深入研究，不去计算为了建设所必需的物质前提、劳动后备力量与天然资源，不去发现新的潜力，对于国民经济中的平衡关系与脆弱环节不进行分析，那就不可能制订出科学的长期计划来。
    在基本搞清了物质资源、劳动资源和财政资源以后，苏联国家计划委员会重新开始了计划的编制工作。摆在当时需要解决的一个问题就是编制计划应从那一个环节开始？
    根据马克思列宁主义关于生产资料优先增长的原理，联共（布）中央规定五年计划的中心环节是发展重工业。根据这一原则，编制计划应从重工业开始，以它为核心，来确定其他一系列与之联系的指标。在编制重工业计划时，又以机器制造业为其核心，根据机器制造业以及其他部门的需要量，确定钢铁部门的生产量。无论机器制造业或钢铁工业，都需要有大量的动力，因此在这二个部门的生产量确定以后，就可大致规定电力工业的发展规模。电力发展问题与燃料采掘问题是相互联系的，因此电力工业发展规模的确定又必然成为编制燃料采掘计划的重要根据。机械、钢铁、电力、燃料部门生产的扩大，除了依靠现有企业潜力的发掘外，还必须进行基本建设。进行基本建设需要建筑材料。上述几个主要部门基本建设量的确定，就可大致规定建筑材料部门的生产量。这样，从重工业的核心——机器制造业的生产计划出发，一环接着一环，就可逐渐确定重工业部门内部的计划了。
    与发展重工业同时，要相应地发展轻工业。在确定了重工业计划以后，当时的苏联国家计划委员会，就从轻重工业的比例关系方面，从轻工业的设备能力方面，从轻工业各个部门间的相互关系方面，从轻工业各个部门的发展速度方面，从供给轻工业以原料的可能性方面，从居民购买力的增长方面，确定了轻工业生产计划。
    苏联第一个五年计划规定：全部工业的增长速度平均每年为百分之二十二，重工业的平均每年增长速度为百分之二十七，轻工业为百分之十八，在五年计划完成时，工业在国民经济总产值中的比重，由计划期初的百分之四十八上升到百分之七十点七。
    与工业生产紧密联系的是农业生产。工业人口与工业消费品生产规模的急遽增长，需要农业部门的粮食及技术作物有相应的增长。在编制五年计划草案之初，曾对农业的原有发展水平作了分析，这个分析指出：原料作物在恢复时期内虽有很大的增加，但仍不足供应工业生产的日益增长的需要，另一严重的问题是谷物生产十分不足。这一分析同时指出：这个问题的合理解决必须从两方面着手，一方面是改良耕种方法（如冬耕、作物轮种、增加耕畜、增加机械等），另一方面是加强农业中的社会化部分。计划规定社会化部分的耕种面积扩大百分之十三，到计划期末，整个社会化农业部分的产品占全国农产品的百分之十九点八，占商品谷物的百分之四十三。
    工农业生产量计划的确定，就为编制运输部门的货运量计划奠定了基础。根据各种工农业产品的生产量及其运输系数（生产量与运输量之比，生产量除去本地消费量即为运输量）即可大致确定运输总量。五年计划规定建成铁路线一万余公里。
    在工业、农业以及运输能力业已确定的基础上，编制了商品流转计划。为了减轻计划期内的“商品荒”，在编制计划时，对于决定经济政策的一切因素，如价格、国民收入的增长率、税收、贷款等，都考虑到其与市场平衡的关系。根据消费品的生产能力，五年计划规定几种主要消费品的流转额增加一倍左右。商品的供应构成有了变化，大工业产品的比重自百分之七十点五增加到百分之七十五点九。根据这种供应构成的变化，来计划“有组织的”市场与“自由”市场的比例关系，规定前者由百分之四十九点一提高到百分之五十二点一。
    根据工、农、商业各部门的发展速度，根据劳动生产率的增长速度，根据工资基金与商品市场基金之间的平衡关系，就可最终确定居民收入的增长计划。苏联第一个五年计划规定，工人的货币工资在五年期间增加百分之四十七，实际工资增加百分之七十点五，个人的总收入增加百分之七十五。
    要进行这样巨大的生产建设，必须具备一定的劳动资源与财政资源，劳动计划与财政计划就是根据生产量与基本建设量计划来制订的。
    工人数量的确定，一方面根据生产量的增长速度，另一方面根据劳动生产率的提高速度。工程技术人员的数量，则是根据每一千个工人的工程技术人员定额来确定的，当时规定这个定额在重工业部门为一百二十人，在轻工业部门为四十人。当时苏联的工程技术人员也十分缺乏，计划规定两方面的措施来解决这一问题，一方面是改变原有高等教育中技术专门人材的训练制度，缩短训练期限，使毕业生数目增加百分之十二。另一方面是大规模地建立工人技术训练系统，提高一百三十万工人的技术熟练水平，以便从其中培养出一批技术人员来。
    在编制财政计划方面的一个基本问题是正确规定财政收入与支出各项目间的比例关系。当时各种财政指标的确定是通过综合财政计划、国家预算、部门财政计划、信贷计划以及国家银行现金收支计划等五个方面反映出来的。综合财政计划是作为一种平衡性的文件而编制的，国家预算是综合财政计划的一部分，在国家预算的基础上编制部门财政计划。苏联第一个五年计划中全部资金的来源如下：国家预算占百分之五十二，国家企业积累的资金占百分之二十二，社会保险基金占百分之十点七，银行系统的积累占百分之七点七，自有资金占百分之七点六。
    在上述各部门的计划编制完了以后，就可以进行总的平衡。通过物资平衡表、劳动平衡表以及财政平衡表各有关项目的适应，保证国民经济各部门发展的和谐一致，使社会扩大再生产诸过程——生产、分配、流通、消费、积累之间形成一种新的比例关系。
    上述这一种计划程序，是由国民经济各部门客观的内在联系所决定的。在社会经济的实际过程中，这种联系是多方面的和十分复杂的，在编制计划的初始阶段，只能掌握其主导的联系，以后再加以逐步的补充与修正。
    编制国民经济计划时最基本的问题是正确规定发展速度和比例关系，前者反映社会主义基本经济法则的要求，后者反映国民经济有计划按比例发展法则的要求。依据联共（布）第十五次代表大会关于拟定国民经济五年计划的指示，苏联第一个五年计划正确地解决了这一问题。
    在制订国民经济中最基本的比例关系——生产和消费的比例关系时，计划工作人员考虑到这一比例关系的相对矛盾及其统一，根据苏联第一个五年计划的基本任务，规定了积累比重的提高。积累在国民收入中的比重从百分之十九提高为百分之三十三，这样就为扩大生产准备了物质前提，而生产的扩大又为来日的扩大消费创造条件。
    在制订工农业之间的比例关系时，苏联国家计划委员会特别研究了工农业之间的不平衡问题，这种不平衡表现为：工业品与农业品价格间的不平衡（即市场上的“剪刀差”），技术作物及粮食的需要与供给间的不平衡，农村劳动力现有数量及经济上可能实际利用的数量间的不平衡。苏联第一个五年计划制订了一系列的措施来消灭上述的各种不平衡，这些措施就是：在减低工业品成本的基础上减低工业品价格，发展粮食和技术作物的生产，实现农业的合作化和提高技术水平，通过信用系统尽力吸收小额储蓄。
    在制订轻重工业的比例关系时，计划工作人员
  一方面考虑到重工业的优先增长，集中投资来发展重工业，另一方面也注意到将国家资金过多地积压在必须经过多年才能动用的大建设上的危险性，同时为了满足居民需要量的日益增长，决定在重点发展重工业的同时，相应地发展轻工业，苏联第一个五年计划决定轻重工业的比例关系为五十三（重工业）比四十七（轻工业）。
    在编制基本建设计划时，苏联国家计划委员会特别注意到新建工业单位数量及其竣工时间的关系，以及投资与动用之间的比例关系（即动用系数），决定将每年基本投资尽量投入比较有限数量的新工厂和选定改建的现有企业中。
    在发展速度问题上，苏联国家计划委员会分析了计划期内决定发展速度的四个因素——劳动消耗量、劳动生产率水平、物资消耗节约、固定资产与流动资产储存——的增长情况，决定不要求于短时期内使资金积累达到最高速度，而是要求在国民经济各个部分间保持一定比例关系的基础上，保证长期的最快的发展速度。这种把发展速度与计划关系联系起来的处理方法，就把编制国民经济比例时的两个基本问题辩证地统一起来了。
