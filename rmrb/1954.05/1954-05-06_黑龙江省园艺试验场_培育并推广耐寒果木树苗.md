Heilongjiang Provincial Horticultural Experiment Station

Cultivates and Promotes Cold-Resistant Fruit Tree Saplings

The first batch of cold-resistant fruit tree saplings successfully cultivated by the Heilongjiang Provincial Horticultural Experiment Station has been promoted to all parts of the province. The first batch of cold-resistant fruit tree saplings cultivated by the Suileng Horticultural Experiment Station in the province totals 35,000 trees, including five varieties: small apple, Daqiuguo (large autumn fruit), yellow crabapple, bell fruit, and Huang Taiping (yellow peace), which can be planted on 130 hectares. The fruit tree saplings have now been transported to various places. In order to ensure the successful promotion and good results of this batch of fruit tree saplings, it has been decided that most of them will first be promoted in local state-owned farms and demonstration farms, and then gradually promoted to the vast rural areas after experience has been gained. This batch of fruit tree saplings can be completely planted by early May.

The Suileng Horticultural Experiment Station and the Qiqihar Horticultural Experiment Station are mass-cultivating fruit tree saplings. Next year, the two stations can successfully cultivate 400,000 trees, which will be successively promoted to farmers, enough to plant 1,000 hectares of land.

    黑龙江省园艺试验场
    培育并推广耐寒果木树苗
    黑龙江省园艺试验场培育成功的第一批耐寒果木树苗，已经推广到全省各地。该省绥棱园艺试验场培育的第一批耐寒果木树苗共有三万五千棵，其中有小苹果、大秋果、黄海棠、铃铛果、黄太平等五种品种，能种植一百三十垧，果木树苗现已运到各地。为了使这一批果木树苗推广成功，得到良好效果，决定大部分先在地方国营农场、示范农场推广，逐渐取得经验以后再推广到广大农村。这批果木树苗，到五月上旬就可全部种完。
    绥棱园艺试验场和齐齐哈尔园艺试验场正在大量培育果木树苗，明年两场可培育成功四十万棵，陆续推广给农民，能种一千垧地。
