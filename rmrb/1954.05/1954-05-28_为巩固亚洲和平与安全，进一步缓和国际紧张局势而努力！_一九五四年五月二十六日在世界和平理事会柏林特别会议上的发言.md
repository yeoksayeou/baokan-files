As the last session of the World Peace Council convened in Vienna in November last year, people around the world welcomed the Korean armistice with jubilation. The World Peace Council's continuous appeals for more than three years finally came to fruition, and the Korean War, which had seriously threatened world peace for more than three years, finally came to an end, thereby beginning to ease the tense international situation somewhat.

At the beginning of this year, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France held a meeting in Berlin to extensively exchange views on European security, the German and Austrian issues, and disarmament. Although no agreement was reached, the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting had important gains. That is: it was decided to convene a meeting in Geneva on April 26, including the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries, to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

After the cessation of the Korean War, which lasted for three years, the largest existing war is the Indochina War. This war has been going on for eight years, and some people are trying to internationalize it. Kind people all over the world are calling for the restoration of peace in Indochina with the same enthusiasm they have shown for more than three years in calling for a ceasefire in Korea.

Therefore, people all over the world are eagerly looking forward to the Geneva Conference achieving complete success.

At the Geneva Conference, the representatives of the Soviet Union, China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other relevant countries sat together to review and resolve the most pressing Asian issues. This event itself has major historical significance. The five-power consultation called for by the World Peace Council for five years has been initially realized at the Geneva Conference. This means an increase in the possibility of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, and it also means that the solution of all major Asian and international issues must have the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China.

We, the Chinese people, deeply realize that we bear a major responsibility for maintaining Asian peace and world peace. Our delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, is attending the conference representing the will of our 500 million people. Their major mission is to promote the success of the conference with unlimited sincerity and patience and in a spirit of consultation - that is to say, to promote the reaching of an agreement at the conference so that Indochina can restore peace and the unstable Korean armistice can achieve a genuine peaceful settlement.

The Geneva Conference has been open for a full month, but the progress of the conference cannot but make us feel growing anxiety. The agenda items discussed are quite complex and important, which we can understand. If the representatives of all participating countries conduct discussions with sincerity and enthusiasm, then we don't need to worry, but the fact is not like that!

I would like to ask the council members and friends present to recall the process since the opening of the Geneva Conference. We remember that on the second day of the Geneva Conference - April 27 - the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mr. Nam Il, put forward a concrete plan for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, while the Foreign Minister of South Korea, Mr. Pyun Yung-tai, did not propose a plan with any new content until May 22, when the conference had been going on for almost four weeks.

The same is true regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina. Acting Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Mr. Pham Van Dong, arrived in Geneva on May 4. Similarly, on the second day of the discussion of the Indochina issue - May 10 - he had already put forward an eight-point proposal to comprehensively resolve the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. On May 14, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made additional suggestions: implementing a ceasefire under the supervision of a neutral nations supervisory commission, but the other party has been reluctant to engage in substantive discussions until now.

From these specific facts, we can clearly see that someone is deliberately delaying and obstructing the Geneva Conference to prevent it from reaching an agreement, but who should bear this responsibility?

If we calmly examine the content of the plans proposed by both sides, it will be even clearer who bears the responsibility.

The suggestions made by Foreign Minister Nam Il to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War and peacefully resolve the Korean issue include the following: all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea within six months; free elections should be held with the participation of all the people of North and South Korea to establish a national democratic unified government. To discuss specific steps to prepare for and conduct democratic elections, a joint conference of North and South Korean representatives should be convened to form an all-Korean committee. This committee should take measures to promote economic and cultural ties between North and South Korea. However, this proposal was opposed and rejected by US Secretary of State Dulles. Mr. Dulles created a ridiculous logic at the conference. He said that American troops should not withdraw from Korea because America is too far from Korea and it would not be easy for American troops to return after withdrawal. Isn't this ridiculous! The intention of the United States government represented by Mr. Dulles, to put it bluntly, is to occupy South Korea indefinitely. Moreover, he has not forgotten to continue to annex Korea under the guise of the United Nations, and re-proposed the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on October 7, 1950, under the manipulation of the United States, considering it a "practical and feasible plan" to unify Korea. That plan is nothing more than maintaining the Syngman Rhee regime alone in North Korea under the interference of the American occupation forces to hold so-called "supervised" undemocratic elections. The plan put forward by Mr. Pyun Yung-tai on May 22 is nothing more than a Korean translation of the will of the United States.

I ask: Which of these two proposals on the Korean issue is fairer and more reasonable, and which is more practical and feasible? Which one truly reflects the will of the Korean people and conforms to the interests of the Korean people?

Regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina, the suggestions put forward by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong include the following: recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the three Indochinese countries; withdrawal of foreign troops; holding free and universal elections without foreign interference to establish unified governments in each country. The three countries recognize the existing economic and cultural interests of France, which will be adjusted according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit after the unified governments of the three countries are established. The governments of the three countries are also willing to consider issuing statements on the issue of joining the French Union under the principle of free will. However, French Foreign Minister Bidault still poses as a colonial ruler, appearing as a victor, and put forward similar conditions to those put forward by French Prime Minister Laniel in the French National Assembly on March 5 this year. He mainly demanded that the Indochinese people's armed forces - which he called "rebels" - either be disarmed or concentrated under surveillance, which French public opinion once called conditions for Indochina to surrender.

I ask: Which of these two proposals on the Indochina issue is fairer and more reasonable, and which is more practical and feasible, and which one truly reflects the will of the Indochinese people and conforms to the interests of the Indochinese people?

The fact is very clear: someone is deliberately delaying and obstructing the Geneva Conference and attempting to sabotage it, and the initiator is the powerful ruling group in the United States. The fundamental policy of the United States government is to deliberately create international tensions. Five-star General Marshall, Secretary of State during the Truman administration, once openly stated that the United States would have to create at least ten years of international tension. Although the Democratic government has been replaced by a Republican government, under the leadership of a soldier president, the United States' war policy has not changed. Under the pressure of world opinion and serious military losses, although it was forced to stop the Korean War, the American president did not forget the war. Why? Because American monopoly capitalists can get excess war profits from here. This is the basic secret of the United States' world policy and all its actions.

Therefore, the US government is fundamentally unwilling to ease international tensions. However, under the pressure of world opinion, it is not easy to openly oppose it, so it has no choice but to destroy the negotiations with feigned "consultations" and destroy peace with verbal "peace". The so-called "preventing the threat of communism" and the so-called "defending the free world" are nothing more than substitutes for "creating international tensions". Arbitrarily violating the sovereignty and independence of other countries, arbitrarily establishing military bases in other countries, arbitrarily implementing blockades and embargoes, monopolizing military materials, and using the name of "aid" to carry out plunder, and using the name of "common defense" to carry out encroachment. The American ruling group itself may think that it is very clever with this trick, but it is nothing more than a Chinese saying, "covering one's ears while stealing a bell."

We remember very clearly that the achievement of the Korean armistice agreement was something that the United States government was unwilling to do; the convening of the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting was something that the United States government was unwilling to do; and the convening of the Geneva Conference was especially so. Many facts are in front of us and cannot be concealed in any way. On the eve of the Geneva Conference, the American ruling group and its propaganda machine constantly spread a pessimistic and disappointed atmosphere, predicting that the conference would inevitably be fruitless. In particular, Mr. Dulles, who is accustomed to "attacking from both sides," if the conference is over, that's good, he will also participate in the conference, but he will only participate in "six days" of discussions. As for the restoration of peace in Indochina, that's good, he will also come to discuss it, but what he is pursuing is a "Southeast Asian military alliance." In order to realize this "Southeast Asian military alliance," on the eve of attending the meeting, he flew to Britain and France to force Britain and France to take "joint action." He flew to Europe, then to Asia, and then back to America! What did he do when he flew back to the United States? One of them he has made clear to everyone: that is still the promotion of the "Southeast Asian military alliance."

Dear friends, what exactly is the intention of the "Southeast Asian military alliance" that the American ruling group is eager to organize? It is nothing more than squeezing its old rivals Britain and France out of Asia, so as to fulfill its ambition to turn the Pacific Ocean into an American lake. Take a look at the members of the so-called "alliance": that is, in addition to Australia and New Zealand, plus Thailand, the Philippines, and the three corrupt old regimes in Indochina. Moreover, the most absurd thing is to include the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Everyone knows that Taiwan is Chinese territory. Under the pretext of assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the US government is encroaching on our Taiwan and actively arranging to turn Taiwan into a base for it to carry out sabotage activities and further aggression against the People's Republic of China, which the Chinese people absolutely refuse to allow.

Friends, isn't this clear enough? The United States is participating in the Geneva Conference to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, and on the other hand, it is more enthusiastically and almost impatiently organizing a "Southeast Asian military alliance" in an attempt to expand the Indochina War. Who can think that the United States is participating in the Geneva Conference with sincerity? Who can deny that it is not the powerful ruling group in the United States that is delaying and obstructing and attempting to sabotage the Geneva Conference?

The authorities in France are also using two-faced tactics. These followers of the American warmongering group, on the one hand, under the pressure of peace from the French people and world opinion, pretend to want peace talks, while on the other hand, they ask the US government for military assistance. The secret deal between Bidault and Smith in Geneva is underway. Although the French people have long cursed this war as a "dirty war," the war hawks in the French authorities still want to fight. They would rather mortgage Indochina to the United States to fight.

We recently heard that the authorities in France are spreading an atmosphere in Paris that the Geneva Conference is being obstructed, and that the obstructors are the representatives of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union, and that the representatives of these countries are trying to prevent the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement in order to continue to expand the war. It is very interesting that even in broad daylight, some people are playing the magic of reversing black and white. We believe that this is not the French people speaking, but American money speaking. Although I am not French, I respect the glorious tradition of the French people. When I was young, I read the works of Descartes, Voltaire, Rousseau, Molière, Hugo, and other masters through translation. Among French scientists, writers, and social activists, there are also many friends that I respect. I like France, and I firmly believe that the French people have the strength and determination to maintain their glorious tradition. I firmly believe this. We Chinese people have always loved peace and opposed war. We Chinese people are doing our best to carry out peaceful labor. Our goal is to build our motherland into a socialist country so that everyone can live a happy and peaceful life. Our government is a people's government that faithfully pursues a policy of peace, which was, is, and always will be the case. We deeply realize that we bear a major responsibility for maintaining Asian peace and world peace. Therefore, I want to say again: Our delegation, headed by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, is attending the Geneva Conference completely representing the will of the Chinese people, with great sincerity and confidence, and is prepared to promote the conference to reach an agreement in a spirit of peaceful consultation. We Chinese people have high expectations for the Geneva Conference.

Before we came to Berlin to attend this session of the Council, on May 12, we also held a people's rally in Beijing to support the Geneva Conference. Our call is: as long as the American and French representatives are willing to sit down and talk, we will definitely conduct consultations with them with the greatest sincerity and the greatest patience so that the Asian issue can be resolved in a way that is conducive to peace.

Not only the Chinese people eagerly hope for the success of the Geneva Conference, but the vast majority of the Asian people and the governments of Asian countries have the same fervent expectations. Please allow me to cite two prominent facts to remind everyone!

On the eve of the Geneva Conference, on April 24, Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in a statement in the People's House that "the Indochina conflict, in its origin and fundamental nature, is an anti-colonialist resistance movement." Therefore, he opposed the expansion of the Indochina War and advocated the restoration of peace in Indochina based on respect for the independence of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This is a wise view.

At the beginning of the Geneva Conference, from April 28 to 30, the Prime Ministers of India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan issued a communique at the Colombo Conference held in Ceylon, calling for the restoration of peace in Indochina on the basis of non-interference from the outside and respect for the national rights of the Indochinese people; advocating that the People's Republic of China should obtain its due position in the United Nations, and denouncing the existence of colonialism as "a violation of the basic rights of mankind and a threat to world peace."

These are powerful voices from Asian countries that cannot be blocked.

The history of Asia has undergone fundamental changes. The era in which colonialists arbitrarily manipulated the fate of the people of Asian countries and did not allow the people of Asian countries to intervene in Asian issues is gone forever. Recently, social opinion and public leaders' opinions in Western Europe and other regions have mostly adopted more realistic and reasonable views on Asian issues, which we feel gratified about. However, there are also alarming situations. That is, a small number of stubborn colonialists, especially the ruling group in the United States, are deliberately closing their eyes and refusing to face reality.

I believe that the Asian issue is the same as the European issue. Collective security in Europe is the key to peace in Europe and the development of the people of European countries. Similarly, collective security in Asia is the key to peace in Asia and the development of the people of Asian countries. For the long-term peaceful interests of the Asian nations and countries, it is necessary not only to resolve the urgent Korean and Indochinese issues, but also to seek common collective security including every country in Asia, which can ensure peace and national independence in Asia. What is this prerequisite? Its prerequisite is to be free from the interference of colonialists. Under this prerequisite, we "Asian countries should respect each other's independence and sovereignty and not interfere in each other's internal affairs; should resolve disputes between countries through peaceful consultations, without using force or threats; should establish and develop normal economic and cultural relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, without allowing discrimination and restrictions." These are the principles for establishing collective security in Asia put forward by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his speech at the Geneva Conference on May 12.

Although Asian countries were economically backward during the old colonial period, each country has its own long history of culture, history, hardworking people, abundant resources, and good natural conditions, and they are capable of developing. In the future development of Asian countries, as long as we can adhere to the above principles and work together by mutually undertaking corresponding obligations, we can live in peace, maintain peace and security in Asia, and contribute to collective security throughout the world.

We Chinese people respect our own independence and sovereignty, and therefore we also respect the independence and sovereignty of our neighbors. We Chinese people respect our own peaceful construction, and therefore we also respect the peaceful construction of our neighbors. We Chinese people respect our own cultural creation, and therefore we also respect the cultural creation of our neighbors.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our basic foreign policy has been like this. We have established diplomatic relations with many countries based on these principles, and we have signed trade agreements with the business community in Japan and the governments of Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Mongolia, and North Korea. Recently, we have signed a new agreement with India, establishing trade and traffic relations between India and China's Tibet on the principle of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. China and India have had more than two thousand years of exchanges in history, and we have always lived in peace and have never engaged in war. We believe that this should serve as a historical proof that countries can live in peace with each other. At the same time, we have also exchanged cultural and artistic envoys with India, Burma, Mongolia, and North Korea to enhance national friendship and understanding.

We are carrying out the first five-year plan of peaceful construction. We want to improve the people's material and cultural living standards through socialist industrialization. The construction achievements of the Chinese people in the four years since the founding of our country and their desire to live in peace with the people of all countries can be witnessed by fair-minded people from many countries in Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Australia who have visited our country. Our ancestors left a good lesson more than three thousand years ago: "All within the four seas are brothers." We are willing to abide by this lesson. We will never invade others, but we can never tolerate being invaded by others. History proves to us that even if we are invaded by foreign nations, even if we go through two or three hundred years of long struggle, we must restore our freedom, independence, and peace.

Dear friends! Discussing the collective security of all countries in the world is the primary agenda of this session of the Council, so I have focused on the situation in Asia.

Collective security is indivisible. Collective security in Asia is undoubtedly a component of world collective security. We Chinese people maintain collective security in Asia and also maintain collective security in Europe. Collective security is indivisible. We fully support the prohibition of the use of hydrogen bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, because the formation and consolidation of collective security are more conducive to ensuring the prohibition of the use of hydrogen bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. In a positive aspect, it is more conducive to the control and peaceful use of atomic energy.

Dear friends! Regarding these important issues that we are currently focusing on, we believe that after earnest collective research, the necessary practical resolutions will be produced. We Chinese people will fully support and implement any favorable peaceful resolutions produced by collective wisdom.

Finally, regarding the Geneva Conference, which is related to the current international situation, I would like to remind everyone again: the Geneva Conference must reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and it should be able to reach an agreement. However, just as the convening of the Geneva Conference was realized because the peace-loving people of the world strengthened public opinion pressure on those who feared peace and created war, in order to promote the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement that is conducive to peace, it is still necessary for the peace-loving people of all countries to be vigilant, to always guard against the sabotage conspiracies of the American warmongering group and its followers, and to continue to vigorously promote just public opinion that demands the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement, to warmly support plans to defend peace and maintain independent sovereignty, and only then can peace be victorious.

Peace must be victorious, and the struggle of oppressed nations for national independence and defense of territorial sovereignty must also be victorious.

Colonialism has ended in China, is about to end in Asia, and will inevitably end throughout the world. We hope that the days when people all over the world live in peace with each other like brothers under the united cooperation of collective security will be able to arrive within a not-too-distant period.

    为巩固亚洲和平与安全，进一步缓和国际紧张局势而努力！
    ——一九五四年五月二十六日在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上的发言
    中国代表团团长　郭沫若
    当去年十一月在维也纳召开上一届世界和平理事会会议时，世界广大人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接了朝鲜停战。世界和平理事会三年多来不断的呼吁终于实现了，三年多严重地威胁着世界和平的朝鲜战争终于停止了下来，从而使紧张的国际局势开始有了些缓和。
    今年初，在柏林举行了苏、美、英、法四国外长会议，就欧洲安全、德奥问题及裁减军备问题广泛交换了意见。虽然没有达成协议，但是，柏林四国外长会议是有重要的收获的。那就是：决定在四月二十六日在日内瓦召开包括苏联、美国、法国、英国和中华人民共和国及其他有关国家的会议，来讨论恢复印度支那的和平与朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    在继续了三年的朝鲜战争停止了以后，现存最大规模的战争就是印度支那战争了。这个战争已经进行了八年，而且正有人企图加以国际化，全世界善良的人民，正以三年多来呼吁朝鲜停战的同样热情，呼吁印度支那和平的恢复。
    因而，全世界人民热烈期待着日内瓦会议能够获得圆满的成就。
    在日内瓦会议上，苏联、中国、法国、英国、美国和其他有关国家的代表们坐在一起，来审查和解决最迫切的亚洲问题这一事件本身就具有重大的历史意义。五年来，世界和平理事会号召的五大国协商在日内瓦会议得到了初步的实现，这意味着经过和平协商以解决国际争端的可能性的增长，也意味着所有重大的亚洲问题和国际问题的解决，都得有中华人民共和国的代表参加。
    我们中国人民，深切地体会到对于维护亚洲和平与世界和平负有着重大的责任，我们的以周恩来外长为首的代表团是代表着我们五万万人民的意志去参加会议的。他们的重大的使命就是抱着无限的诚恳和耐心，以协商精神促进会议的成功——这就是说，要促成会议达成协议，使印度支那能够恢复和平，使不稳定的朝鲜停战状态能够达到真正的和平解决。
    日内瓦会议开幕以来已经整整一个月了，会议进行的情况却使我们不能不感受着日益增长的忧虑，所讨论的议程都相当复杂和都有重要性，我们是能够理解的。假使所有与会国家的代表都怀抱诚意和热心进行讨论，那我们也用不着担心，然而事实却不是那样！
    我要请到会的理事和朋友们回忆一下日内瓦会议开会以来的经过，我们记得在日内瓦会议开幕的第二天——四月二十七日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的外务相南日先生就提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的具体方案，而南朝鲜的外务部长官卞荣泰先生却一直到五月二十二日，会议已经进行快四个星期，才提出了一个毫无新的内容的方案。
    关于印度支那恢复和平的问题也有同样的情形，越南民主共和国代理外长范文同先生是五月四日到达日内瓦的，同样在开始讨论印度支那问题的第二天——五月十日就已经提出了八点建议来全面解决恢复印度支那和平的问题。五月十四日，苏联外长莫洛托夫先生又有了补充建议：在中立国监督委员会监督之下实行停战，然而对方却一直到现在都迟迟不肯进行实质的讨论。
    从这些具体事实我们可以明白地看出，日内瓦会议是有人存心在拖延阻挠而使它不能达成协议，但这责任是应该由谁来负呢？
    假使我们平心静气地检查一下双方所提的方案的内容，那责任谁负的问题就更容易明了了。
    南日外务相所提的防止朝鲜战争的再起与和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，包含着这样的内容：一切外国军队在六个月以内撤出朝鲜；举行南北朝鲜全体人民参加的自由选举，以成立全国性的民主统一政府。为了讨论筹备和进行民主选举的具体步骤，召开南北朝鲜代表联席会议组成全朝鲜委员会。由这个委员会采取措施以促进南北朝鲜经济和文化的联系，然而这个建议却遭受了美国国务卿杜勒斯的反对和拒绝，杜勒斯先生在会议上创造了一个可笑的逻辑。他说，美国军队不应该从朝鲜撤退，因为美国距离朝鲜太远，美国军队撤退后回来不容易。这不是很滑稽的吗！杜勒斯先生所代表的美国政府的意图，直截了当地说就是要无限期地占领南朝鲜。而且他也没有忘记依然要假借联合国的名义吞并朝鲜，并重新提出一九五零年十月七日联合国大会在美国操纵下所通过的决议，认为是统一朝鲜的“切实可行的方案”。那个方案不外是在美国占领军的干涉下，维持着李承晚政权单独在北朝鲜举行所谓“有监督的”不民主的选举而已。卞荣泰先生在五月二十二日所提出的方案，不外是美国意志的朝鲜文的翻版。
    请问：这关于朝鲜问题的双方建议，到底那一方更公平合理，那一方更切实可行？那一方是真正地体现着朝鲜人民的意志，并符合朝鲜人民的利益呢？
    关于恢复印度支那和平的问题，范文同代理外长所提出的建议，包含着这样的内容：承认印度支那三国的独立主权；撤退外国军队；举行不受外来干涉的自由普选以建立各国的统一政府。三国承认法国现有的经济与文化上的利益，等将来三国的统
  一政府成立之后，根据平等互利的原则进行调整，三国政府并愿意考虑在自由意志的原则下，就研究加入法兰西联邦的问题发表声明。然而法国外长皮杜尔先生却依然以殖民地统治者自居，以战胜者的姿态出现，提出了在今年三月五日法国的拉尼埃总理在法国国民议会所提出过的相类似的条件。他主要要求印度支那的人民武力——他是称之为“叛军”的——或者解除武装或者集中看管，那在法国舆论是曾经称之为要印度支那投降的条件。
    请问：这关于印度支那问题的双方建议，到底那一方更公平合理、更切实可行，那一方是真正体现着印度支那人民的意志，并符合印度支那人民的利益呢？
    事实是非常明显的：日内瓦会议是有人存心拖延阻挠并企图加以破坏，那主动者就是美国有势力的统治集团。美国政府的根本方针，就是存心制造国际紧张局势。杜鲁门政府时代的国务卿马歇尔五星元帅就曾经公开说过，美国起码要制造十年的国际紧张局势。民主党政府虽然改换成了共和党政府，但在军人总统领导下，美国的战争政策是并没有改变的。受着世界舆论的压力和军事上的严重损失，虽然被迫把朝鲜战争停止了下来，而美国总统并没有忘记战争。为什么？因为美国的垄断资本家可以从这里得到超额的战争利润，这就是美国的世界政策和一切行动的基本秘密。
    因此，要缓和国际紧张局势，美国政府根本是不愿意的。但在世界舆论的压力面前，又不好公开反对，故只好以假意的“协商”而破坏协商；以口头的“和平”而破坏和平；所谓“防止共产主义的威胁”、所谓“保卫自由世界”，那些都不外是
  “制造国际紧张局势”的代用语而已。任意干犯别国的主权、独立，任意在别国境内建立军事基地，任意执行封锁、禁运，垄断军事物资，假“援助”之名，而进行掠取，假“共同防御”之名，而实行侵占。这一套伎俩，美国统治集团自己可能自以为十分聪明，然而这不外我们中国老百姓的一句俗话“掩耳盗铃”而已。
    我们还记得很清楚，朝鲜停战谈判的达成协议，是美国政府所不愿意的；柏林四国外长会议的召开，是美国政府所不愿意的；日内瓦会议的召开尤其是这样。许多事实摆在我们的面前，怎么也无法掩饰。在日内瓦会议的前夕，美国统治集团和它的宣传机关，就经常不断地散布出悲观失望的空气，预言会议必然毫无结果，特别是杜勒斯先生，他惯会“两面开弓”，会议罢，好的，他也来参加会议，但他只“参加六天”讨论，印度支那的和平的恢复罢，好的，他也来讨论，但他所进行的是
  “东南亚军事联盟”。为了实现这个“东南亚军事联盟”，他去开会前夕，便曾经飞到英国和法国，想强迫英国和法国采取“联合行动”，他一下子飞到欧洲，一下子飞到亚洲，一下子又飞回美洲，他飞到日内瓦参加会议之后，仅仅一个礼拜又飞回美国去了！飞回美国去做什么呢？其中有一项他已经明白地向大家说出了：那依然是“东南亚军事联盟”的策动。
    各位亲爱的朋友，美国统治集团所急于要组织的“东南亚军事联盟”的用意究竟是什么呢？那不外是把他的老对手英国和法国从亚洲排挤出去，以遂其将太平洋变为美国内湖的野心而已。请看那所谓“联盟”的成员吧：那就是澳大利亚、新西兰之外，再加上泰国、菲律宾和印度支那的三个腐朽的旧政权。而且，最荒谬的是还要包含蒋介石匪帮，大家知道，台湾是中国的领土，美国政府在援助蒋介石匪帮的借口之下，侵占着我们的台湾，并积极布置把台湾变成它对中华人民共和国进行破坏活动和进一步侵略的据点，这是中国人民所绝对不肯容许的。
    各位朋友，这还不够明显吗？美国一面参加日内瓦会议，讨论印度支那恢复和平的问题，而在另一面，却更热心地几乎迫不及待地在组织“东南亚军事联盟”，企图扩大印度支那战争，谁能够认为美国的参加日内瓦会议是有诚意的呢？谁能够否认拖延阻挠并企图破坏日内瓦会议的不就是美国有势力的统治集团呢？
    法国的当权者们也在使用两面手法，这些美国好战集团的追随者们，一方面在法国人民与世界舆论的和平压力下，装着要和平谈判，而另一方面，却向美国政府要求军事援助。在日内瓦的皮杜尔先生与史密斯之间正进行着不敢公开的买卖，尽管法国人民早就诅咒这场战争是“肮脏战争”，然而，法国当局中的主战派还是要打。宁肯把印度支那抵押给美国也要打。
    我们最近听说法国的当权者在巴黎散布着一种空气说，日内瓦会议是受着阻挠，而阻挠者是越南、中国和苏联的代表，是这些国家的代表企图使日内瓦会议不能达成协议，以便继续扩大战争。有趣得很，在这样光天化日之下，竟还有人玩弄着颠倒黑白的魔术，我们认为这并不是法国的人在说话，而是美国的钱在说话。我虽然不是法国人，但我是尊重法兰西人民的光荣的传统的。我在年青的时候通过翻译阅读过笛卡尔、伏尔泰、卢骚、莫里哀、雨果等诸位大师的著作，在法国的科学家、文学家和社会活动家中也有不少我所尊敬的友人，我喜欢法兰西，我是坚决地相信法兰西人民是有力量和决心保持着他们的光荣的传统的。我是坚决地这样相信。我们中国人民向来是热爱和平、反对战争的。我们中国人民在用尽全力来进行和平劳动，我们的目的就是要把我们的祖国建设成为一个社会主义国家，使每一个人都能够过幸福的和平生活。我们的政府是人民的政府，它忠实地奉行着和平政策，过去是现在是今后也永远是这样。我们深切地体会到对于维护亚洲和平与世界和平是负有重大的责任的。因而我要重说一遍：以我们的周恩来外长为首的代表团是完全代表中国人民的意志去参加日内瓦会议的。抱着极大的诚意和信心，准备以和平协商的精神促进会议达成协议的。我们中国人民对日内瓦会议怀抱着热烈的期待。
    在我们到柏林来参加本届理事会议之前，五月十二日我们在北京还举行了一次支持日内瓦会议的人民集会，我们的号召是：只要美国代表、法国代表愿意坐下来谈，我们就一定用最大的诚意和最大的耐心和他们进行协商，使亚洲问题得到有利于和平的解决。
    不仅中国人民热烈地期望日内瓦会议的成功，绝大多数的亚洲人民和亚洲各国的政府都有同样热烈的期望。请让我举出两个显著的事实来引起各位的回忆吧！
    当日内瓦会议的前夕，四月二十四日印度总理尼赫鲁先生在人民院发表的声明中指出：“印度支那冲突就其起源和基本性质来说，乃是反殖民主义的反抗运动。”因此，他反对扩大印度支那战争，主张在尊重越南、高棉、寮国三国人民独立的基础之上恢复印度支那和平。这是明智的见解。
    在日内瓦会议开始的时候，四月二十八日至三十日印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦五国总理在锡兰举行的科伦坡会议发表公报，呼吁在不受外来干涉和尊重印度支那人民民族权利的基础之上，恢复印度支那和平；主张中华人民共和国应在联合国取得应有的地位，并痛斥殖民主义的存在是“违反人类的基本权利的，对于世界和平是一种威胁。”
    这些都是封锁不了的亚洲各国的有力的呼声。
    亚洲的历史已经发生了根本的变化了，殖民主义者任意摆布亚洲各国人民的命运，不让亚洲各国人民过问亚洲问题的时代，已经一去不复返了。最近，西欧和其他地区的社会舆论和公众领袖的意见，对于亚洲问题多已经采取了更现实的合理的看法，我们是感觉着欣慰的。然而，也有可惊叹的事态存在，那就是少数顽固的殖民主义者，特别是美国的统治集团，他们却存心闭着眼睛不肯正视现实。
    我以为亚洲问题也和欧洲问题一样，欧洲的集体安全是欧洲和平与欧洲各国人民的发展的锁钥，亚洲的集体安全同样是亚洲和平与亚洲各国人民的发展锁钥。为了亚洲各民族和各个国家的长远的和平利益，不仅要解决急待解决的朝鲜问题与印度支那问题，而且要谋求共同的包括亚洲每个国家都在内的集体安全，这才能确保亚洲的和平和民族独立。这个先决条件是什么呢？它的先决条件就是要不受殖民主义者的干涉。在这个先决条件之下，我们“亚洲国家应该互相尊重各国的独立和主权，而不互相干涉内政；应该以和平协商方法解决各国之间的争端，而不使用武力和威胁；应该在平等互利的基础上建立和发展各国之间的正常的经济和文化关系，而不容许歧视和限制。”这是我国周恩来外长五月十二日在日内瓦会议的发言中所提出的建立亚洲集体安全的几点原则。
    亚洲国家虽然在旧殖民主义时期是经济落后的，但每个国家都有它悠久的文化、历史，都有它勤劳的人民，都有它丰富的资源与良好的自然条件，它们是能够发展的。在亚洲各个国家的未来发展中，只要我们能坚守上述的原则，以互相承担相应的义务的方法共同努力，我们是能够和平共处、维护亚洲的和平和安全，并对于全世界的集体安全有所贡献的。
    我们中国人民尊重自己的独立主权，因而也同样尊重邻人的独立主权，我们中国人民尊重自己的和平建设，因而也同样尊重邻人的和平建设，我们中国人民尊重自己的文化创造，因而也同样尊重邻人的文化创造。
    自从中华人民共和国建立以来，我们所奉行的基本上的外交政策便是如此，我们根据这些原则和许多国家建立了外交关系，和日本的贸易界及印尼、缅甸、锡兰、蒙古、朝鲜等国家的政府签订了贸易协定，最近更和印度签订了一个新的协定，在互相尊重领土主权等原则上，确定了印度和中国西藏地方之间的通商和交通的关系。中国和印度在历史上有了两千多年的来往，我们一直是和平相处，从来不曾进行过战争，我们认为这应该可以作为国与国之间可以和平共处的一个历史的证明。同时，我们还和印度、缅甸、蒙古、朝鲜等国进行了文化和艺术使节的交换，增进了民族间的友好和谅解。
  我们正进行着和平建设的第一个五年计划，我们要通过社会主义工业化，来提高人民的物质生活与文化生活的水平，我国建国四年多来，中国人民的建设成就和它要求与各国人民和平共处的意愿，凡是曾经到过我国参观过的亚洲、欧洲、美洲、非洲、澳洲的许多国家的公正人士都可以作为我们的见证。我们的祖先在三千多年前就留下了一个很好的教训“四海之内皆兄弟也”。我们是愿意遵守这个教训的。我们决不侵略别人，但也决不能忍受别人的侵略。历史替我们证明：即使我们受到外来民族的侵略，即使经历两、三百年的长期的奋斗，我们也要恢复我们的自由、独立与和平的。
    亲爱的朋友们！讨论世界各国的集体安全是本届理事会的首要议程，因此，我着重地说到了亚洲的情况。
    集体安全是不能分割的。亚洲的集体安全，毫无疑问，是世界集体安全的一个组成部分。我们中国人民在维护亚洲集体安全上同样也维护欧洲集体安全，集体安全是不能分割的。我们完全支持禁止氢弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器的使用，因为集体安全的形成和巩固，却更有利于保证禁止使用氢弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器。在积极方面，更有利于原子能的控制和和平利用。
    亲爱的朋友们！关于目前我们集中讨论的这些重要问题，我们相信在经过热诚的集体研究后，一定会产生出应有的切实可行的决议的。凡是由集体的智慧所产生的有利的和平的决议，我们中国人民决以全力来支持和奉行。
    最后，对于和当前国际局势有关的日内瓦会议，我愿意重新提请大家的注意：日内瓦会议对朝鲜问题的和平解决与恢复印度支那的和平一定要达成协议，也应该能够达成协议。但是，正如日内瓦会议的召开，是由于世界爱好和平的人民对畏惧和平制造战争的人们加强了舆论压力才得实现一样，为促进日内瓦会议能达成有利于和平的协议，还需要各国爱好和平的人民提高警惕，随时警戒着美国好战集团及其追随者们的破坏阴谋，并继续大力推动要求日内瓦会议达成协议的公正舆论，热烈支持保卫和平与维护独立主权的方案，和平才能得以胜利。
    和平是必须胜利的，被压迫民族为民族独立与保卫领土主权的战斗，也是必须胜利的。
    殖民主义在中国是结束了，在亚洲也是将要结束了，在全世界也必然会结束。全世界人民在集体安全的团结合作之下，像兄弟一样和平共处的日子，我们希望在不很长远的年限内便能够到来。
