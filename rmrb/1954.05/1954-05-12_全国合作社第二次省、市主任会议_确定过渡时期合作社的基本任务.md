Second National Provincial and Municipal Cooperative Directors Conference
Determines Basic Tasks of Cooperatives During the Transition Period

[Xinhua News Agency, 11th] The All-China Federation of Cooperatives held the Second National Provincial and Municipal Cooperative Directors Conference from March 18th to April 22nd. This conference, based on the spirit of the general task of the transition period and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, used criticism and self-criticism to review the work of supply and marketing cooperatives over the past four years and determined the basic tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives during the transition period. The conference also discussed the organizational construction of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels and urban consumer cooperatives. Finally, Cheng Zihua, acting director of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, gave a summary.

During the conference discussions, the delegates reviewed the work of the cooperatives over the past four years and believed that under the leadership of the people's democratic government, the achievements of the cooperatives were enormous, and they had basically completed the tasks that cooperatives should have undertaken during the period of national economic recovery and the beginning of the period of planned construction. Supply and marketing cooperatives have become huge trade organizations belonging to the working people, spread all over the country; they have played a powerful role in promoting the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production, and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agriculture and handicrafts; they have become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, expanded the leading force of the socialist economy in rural areas, reduced the intermediate exploitation of private merchants, narrowed the position of capitalist commerce, and began to form new forms of urban-rural integration. In his summary report, Cheng Zihua said that while estimating the great achievements in our work, we must clearly see our shortcomings. He criticized the fact that the supply and marketing cooperatives' policy of serving agricultural production was not specific and clear enough, and therefore there was blindness in management, and the management could not keep up with the needs of agricultural production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. He said that this was the most important shortcoming. He also cited many facts to illustrate that in the business operations of cooperatives in different regions and periods, there were varying degrees of capitalist business thinking and purely commercial viewpoints, as well as tendencies to ignore politics.

After detailed discussions, the conference put forward three basic tasks for supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period, which are:

    I. Through supply and marketing business, serve agricultural production, develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, support national industrialization, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    II. According to national plans and price policies, gradually guide individual farmers and handicraftsmen's economy into the orbit of national plans through various contract systems and planned supply and marketing business, so as to promote their socialist transformation.

    III. Under the leadership of the state-owned commercial leading organs, expand the organized market, strengthen the leadership of the rural market, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of rural private merchants, so as to gradually replace the position of capitalist commerce in rural areas and cut off the connection between peasants and urban capitalism.

In order to implement these three basic tasks, the conference studied in detail the business work and organizational forms of supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as political work. The conference believes that planned procurement and planned supply work should be placed first in the current cooperative business. In the supply of means of production, attention should be paid to the situation in economic crop areas and general crop areas, plains and mountainous areas, and the degree of development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, so as to grasp the changing laws of rural needs for means of production and make the supply as suitable as possible to the needs of farmers. At present, it is necessary to see that due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the amount of funds raised by agricultural producers' cooperatives to purchase improved agricultural tools, new agricultural tools, large draft animals, and commercial fertilizers is increasing day by day. It is necessary to actively carry out livestock transfer, supply more commercial fertilizers to economic crop areas and organized farmers, and vigorously promote farmers' automatic accumulation of natural fertilizers to promote agricultural production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The conference attached great importance to the promotion of pre-purchase contracts and combined contracts, believing that this contract system, coupled with the national price policy, can gradually bring small-scale agricultural production into the national plan. Only bulk agricultural products are purchased through the contract system. Therefore, it is still necessary to do a good job in the procurement of general agricultural and sideline products. The conference also studied the leading role of supply and marketing cooperatives in the primary market, the transformation of handicraftsmen and private merchants, and the need for supply and marketing cooperatives to learn to master price policies. The organizational form of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives was one of the main issues discussed at the conference. In order to facilitate the leadership of the Party committee and government departments, facilitate the promotion of the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and facilitate the democratic supervision of members, the conference determined the principle of building cooperatives based on administrative divisions and taking into account economic divisions.

The conference also discussed the political work of the supply and marketing cooperative system and the policies and tasks of urban consumer cooperatives. The conference believes that the work of consumer cooperatives has also made great achievements in the past four years: it has assisted state-owned commerce in basically guaranteeing the labor income of the working class and the working people; it has powerfully cooperated with state-owned commerce to stabilize prices; it has expanded the socialist retail position; and through the supply activities of consumer cooperatives, it has brought part of the scattered consumption needs into the orbit of the national plan. The conference determined four basic tasks for consumer cooperatives: I. Do a good job in supplying urban workers and working people and reduce intermediate exploitation. II. Assist the state in doing a good job in planned supply. III. Cooperate with state-owned commerce to realize the socialist transformation of private merchants. IV. Promote the development of handicraft production and socialist transformation.

    全国合作社第二次省、市主任会议
    确定过渡时期合作社的基本任务
    【新华社十一日讯】中华全国合作社联合总社从三月十八日到四月二十二日召开了全国合作社第二次省、市主任会议。这次会议，根据过渡时期总任务和中共中央四中全会决议的精神，用批评和自我批评方式，检查了供销合作社四年来的工作，并确定了供销合作社和消费合作社在过渡时期的基本任务。会议也讨论了各级供销合作社和城市消费合作社的组织建设问题。最后，由全国合作社联合总社代主任程子华作了总结。
    在会议讨论中，代表们回顾了过去四年来的合作社工作，认为合作社在人民民主政权领导下成绩是巨大的，基本上完成了在国民经济恢复时期和开始进入有计划建设时期合作社应担负的任务。供销合作社已成为遍布全国的巨大的劳动人民群众自己的贸易组织；对工农业生产特别是农业生产的恢复和发展，对农业、手工业互助合作运动的发展起了有力的促进作用；在城乡物资交流中成为国营商业的有力助手，在农村扩大了社会主义经济的领导力量，减少了私商的中间剥削，缩小了资本主义商业的阵地，开始形成了城乡结合的新形式。程子华在他的总结报告中说，在估计到我们工作中的巨大成绩时，不能不清醒地看到我们的缺点。他批判了由于供销合作社为农业生产服务的方针不够具体不够明确，因而在经营上存在着盲目性，经营赶不上农业生产和互助合作运动发展的需要。他说这是最主要的缺点。他并举出许多事实说明在不同地区、不同时期合作社的业务经营中存在着不同程度的资本主义经营思想和单纯商业观点以及不问政治的倾向等。
    会议经过详细讨论，提出了供销合作社在过渡时期的三个基本任务，这就是：
    一、通过供销业务，为农业生产服务，发展城乡物资交流，支援国家工业化，巩固工农联盟。
    二、根据国家计划和价格政策，通过各种合同制度和有计划的供销业务，逐步引导个体农民和手工业经济纳入国家计划轨道，以促进其社会主义改造。
    三、在国营商业领导机关领导下，扩大有组织的市场，加强对于农村市场的领导，逐步实现对农村私商的社会主义改造，以逐步代替资本主义商业在农村的阵地，切断农民和城市资本主义的联系。
    为了贯彻这三条基本任务，会议详细研究了供销合作社的业务工作和组织形式以及政治工作。会议认为，要把计划收购和计划供应工作摆在当前合作社业务中的第一位。在生产资料供应中，要注意经济作物区和一般作物区、平原和山区以及互助合作运动的发展程度等情况，掌握农村需要生产资料的变化规律，使供应尽可能切合农民的需要。目前，要看到由于互助合作运动的发展，农业生产合作社集资购买改良农具、新式农具、大耕畜以及商品肥料的数量日益增加的趋势，积极进行牲畜调剂，把商品肥料更多地供应到经济作物区和组织起来的农民中，并大力提倡农民自动积压自然肥料，以促进农业生产和互助合作运动的发展。会议很重视推广预购合同和结合合同，认为这种合同制再加以国家的价格政策，可以逐步使小农生产纳入国家的计划。通过合同制采购的只是大宗农产品，因此，仍要做好一般农副业产品的采购工作。会议还研究了供销合作社在初级市场的领导作用和对手工业、私商的改造问题以及供销合作社必须学会掌握价格政策问题。基层供销合作社的组织形式是这次会议讨论的主要问题之一，为便于党委和政府部门领导，便于促进农业互助合作的发展，便于社员民主监督，会议确定了根据行政区划兼顾经济区划为建社的原则。
    会议还讨论了供销合作社系统的政治工作问题和城市消费合作社的方针任务。会议认为：四年来消费合作社的工作也取得了巨大的成绩：它协助国营商业基本上保证了工人阶级和劳动人民的劳动所得；有力地配合国营商业稳定了物价；扩大了社会主义零售阵地；通过消费合作社的供应活动，已将部分分散的消费需要纳入国家计划轨道。会议确定了消费合作社的四个基本任务：一、作好对城市工人和劳动人民的供应工作，减除中间剥削。二、协助国家作好计划供应工作。三、配合国营商业实现对私商的社会主义改造。四、促进手工业的生产发展和社会主义改造。
