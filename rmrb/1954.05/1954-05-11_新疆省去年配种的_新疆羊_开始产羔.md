The native ewes bred with "Xinjiang Sheep" rams in Xinjiang Province last year using artificial insemination and natural mating have now begun to lamb. This year, the province will have about 150,000 "Xinjiang Sheep" breed lambs.

"Xinjiang Sheep" is a fine-wool breed of sheep raised by the Gongnaisi Sheep Farm in Xinjiang Province with the help of Soviet expert Comrade Troitsky. After careful identification, it has been determined to be a high-quality fine-wool breed of sheep in our country that combines both wool and meat production. In 1952, Xinjiang Province focused on promoting "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding rams in the three special districts of Urumqi, Yili, and Tacheng. Last year, it expanded the promotion to the two special districts of Altay and Yanqi. Due to some experience gained in the promotion and improvement work in 1952, the influence of "Xinjiang Sheep" among the masses was expanded. More adequate preparations were made last year, artificial insemination technology was improved, and specific guidance and in-depth publicity were strengthened. Therefore, from the end of October to the middle of December last year, not only was the breeding work of improving 150,000 local sheep completed, but the original plan was also exceeded by more than 7,000 sheep. The improved ewes were all carefully selected by the herdsmen to be local ewes with white fur, strong development, and suitable age. Before breeding, attention was generally paid to feeding management, and some were fed additional fodder, so there were very few cases of empty pregnancies. After breeding, centralized management was generally adopted for pregnant ewes. For example, in Muleihe County, more than 3,400 ewes participated in the improvement last year. Under the guidance of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station, the herdsmen divided these ewes into ten groups according to the pasture conditions and the residence of the ewe owners, and organized four grazing teams to be specifically responsible for grazing and management. The cadres of the station also strengthened the education of the herders, so the ewes were generally very healthy. Now the ewes have begun to lamb. Animal husbandry and veterinary stations throughout Xinjiang have selected technical cadres and organized 30 lambing work groups, carrying medicines, to go deep into the pastures to provide specific guidance and help to the herdsmen in lambing. Many herdsmen have also prepared felt tents or built sheds specifically for the newborn "Xinjiang Sheep" breed lambs.

### 新疆省去年配种的“新疆羊”开始产羔

    新疆省去年配种的“新疆羊”开始产羔
    去年新疆省以“新疆羊”种公羊用人工授精法和自然配种法配种的土种母羊，现已开始产羔。今年全省出生的“新疆羊”种的羊羔将有十五万只左右。
      “新疆羊”是新疆省巩乃斯羊场在苏联专家托罗依茨基同志的帮助下育成的细毛种羊，经过仔细鉴定，已确定是我国优良的毛肉兼用细毛种羊品种。一九五二年新疆省曾在乌鲁木齐、伊犁、塔城三个专区重点推广“新疆羊”种羊，去年又扩大推广到阿勒泰、焉耆两个专区。由于在一九五二年推广改进工作中，取得了一些经验，扩大了“新疆羊”在群众中的影响，去年又做了较充分的准备，改进了人工授精技术，加强了具体指导和深入的宣传，所以从去年十月底至十二月中旬，不仅完成了改进十五万只土种绵羊的配种工作，而且还超过了原计划七千多只。改进的母羊，都是牧民们认真挑选出来的毛色洁白、发育健壮适龄的土种母羊，配种前一般都注意了饲养管理，有的并加喂了草料，所以空胎现象很少。配种后对怀胎母羊一般都采取了集中管理。如木垒河县去年参加改进的母羊有三千四百多只，牧民们在畜牧兽医工作站的指导下，根据牧场情况与母羊主居住的情况，将这些母羊分编为十群，组织了四个牧放小组，专门负责牧放和管理，该站的干部并加强了对牧工的教育，所以一般母羊都很健壮。现在母羊已开始产羔。全疆各地畜牧兽医工作站已抽调出技术干部，组织了三十个接羔工作组，携带药品，深入牧场具体指导与帮助牧民们接羔。有很多牧民也专门为新生的“新疆羊”种的羊羔准备了毡房或修盖了棚圈。
