Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 26th: Huang Hua, the spokesperson of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Geneva Conference, made a statement to reporters from news agencies such as Xinhua News Agency, TASS, Reuters, Associated Press, United Press, Agence France-Presse, and International News Service on the afternoon of the 26th regarding the U.S. government's unreasonable detention of Chinese nationals and students studying in the United States. The statement is as follows:

"Since its establishment, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently protected foreign nationals residing in China, including American nationals, as long as they abide by the laws and decrees of the Chinese government. They can live and work in peace and contentment. If they want to leave China, for whatever reason, they can apply to the people's governments at all levels in accordance with legal procedures. As long as they have no outstanding civil or criminal cases, they can be granted permission. In fact, due to the U.S. government's hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China and its implementation of a blockade and embargo against China, many foreign nationals (including American nationals) have lost their usual occupations and have had no choice but to leave China. We sympathize with these foreign nationals (including American nationals) who have been harmed by the U.S. government's various policies of hostility towards the Chinese people. The Chinese People's Government has not prevented them from leaving China. As far as I know, since 1950, approximately 1,500 American nationals have left China by the end of 1953. Only about 80 people remain in China now. This fact is enough to prove that the claim by certain parties in the United States that the Chinese government is preventing American nationals from leaving the country is purely malicious slander. As for the small number of Americans who have violated the law, the Chinese government has arrested and dealt with them in accordance with the law, which is the responsibility of any sovereign state. We have sufficient evidence for these people who have been arrested for violating the law. Among these Americans detained for violating the law are American nationals residing in China, as well as those who have descended from the sky or drilled in from the sea.

"However, despite this, we are still willing to help the families of the few people who have been detained for violating the law if they have letters for them.

"However, since 1950, the U.S. government has exerted pressure on Chinese nationals in the United States, especially the more than 5,000 Chinese students studying in the United States, and forcibly detained them. Many students and overseas Chinese, when they applied to leave the United States and return to their country, received notices from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service stating: 'Regardless of whether you already have a departure permit, you are ordered not to leave or attempt to leave the United States until you receive notification rescinding this order.' The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service also threatened them that if they violated this order, 'they will be fined no more than $5,000 or imprisoned for no more than five years, or both.' Many of them have been subjected to abuse, arrest, and imprisonment for demanding to return to their country. Since 1951, the U.S. government has even confiscated all passports of Chinese students, making it impossible for them to leave the U.S. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has received many letters from Chinese students studying in the United States, complaining that the U.S. government is forcibly detaining them without any reason. Many family members of Chinese students studying in the U.S. have also requested the Central People's Government to help their children, who have been forcibly detained by the U.S. government, return to their country. Chinese students studying in the U.S. have not committed any crimes, but the U.S. government has deprived them of their freedom to leave the United States, deprived them of their freedom to return to their motherland, and deprived them of their right to return to their hometown and reunite with their families. This not only violates the principles of international law, but is also completely inconsistent with humanitarianism.

"If the U.S. government respects the principles of international law and humanitarianism, it should immediately stop forcibly detaining and mistreating Chinese students and overseas Chinese, and restore their inalienable right to leave the United States, return to their country, and reunite with their families."

Finally, Huang Hua also answered questions raised by the reporters.

    我国代表团发言人在日内瓦发表谈话
    指斥美国政府强迫扣留和虐待留美的中国学生和侨民
    【新华社日内瓦二十六日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人黄华在二十六日下午向新华社、塔斯社、路透社、美联社、合众社、法新社、国际新闻社等通讯社的记者发表关于美国政府无理扣留我侨民和留学生的谈话如下：
    “中华人民共和国中央人民政府自成立以来，对于居留中国境内的外侨，包括美国侨民在内，只要他们遵守着中国政府的法令，一贯给予保护。他们可以安居乐业。如果他们要离开中国，不论为着任何理由，都可以按照法定手续向各级人民政府申请，只要他（或她）没有什么未了的民、刑案件，都可以获得准许。在事实上，由于美国政府对中华人民共和国采取仇视的态度，对中国实行封锁禁运，以致有许多外国侨民（包括美国侨民在内）丧失了他们一向从事的职业，乃不得不离开中国。我们对于这些被美国政府仇视中国人民的各种政策所损害的外侨（包括美侨在内）是同情的。中国人民政府并没有阻挡他们离开中国。据我所知，自一九五零年以来，美国侨民离开中国的，截至一九五三年年底，已有一千五百人左右。现在尚留在中国者仅八十余人。这一事实足以证明美国某些方面说中国政府阻止美侨离境纯系恶意造谣。至于有少数美国人犯了法，中国政府依法予以逮捕处理，这是任何主权国家的职责。对于这些犯法被捕的人我们都掌握有充分的证据。这些因犯法而被拘留的美国人中有居留中国的美国侨民，还有从天上降落下来或从海上钻进来的。
      “但是，尽管如此，我们对于这少数因违法而被拘押的人，如果他们的家属有信件给他们的话，我们仍愿予以帮助。
    “可是，美国政府对于在美国境内的中国侨民、尤其是对于五千余中国留学生，自一九五零年以来，横加压迫，强迫扣留。有许多留学生和侨民，当他们申请离美返国时，他们接到了美国移民局的通知说：‘无论你是否已有离境证，命令你不得离开或企图离开美国，直到你接到通知取消此项命令为止。’美国移民局并威吓他们说，如果他们违犯这一命令，‘将被判处五千美元以下的罚金或五年以下的徒刑，或同时予以两种处分。’他们有不少人竟因要求返国而遭受虐待、逮捕、监禁。自一九五一年以后，美国政府甚至将中国留学生的护照全都收去，使他们无法离开美国。中华人民共和国中央人民政府收到许多中国留美学生的来信，诉说美国政府毫无理由地强迫扣留他们。有许多留美学生的家属也向中央人民政府请求援助他们的被美国政府强迫扣留的子弟回国。中国留美学生并没有犯什么罪，美国政府却剥夺了他们的离开美国的自由，剥夺了他们的返回祖国的自由，剥夺了他们返回家乡与家人团聚的权利。这不仅是违背了国际法原则，而且完全不符合人道主义。
      “美国政府如果尊重国际法原则和人道主义，就应该立即停止强迫扣留和虐待中国的留学生和侨民，恢复他们离美返回祖国与家人团聚的不可被剥夺的权利。”
    最后，黄华并回答了记者们提出的问题。
