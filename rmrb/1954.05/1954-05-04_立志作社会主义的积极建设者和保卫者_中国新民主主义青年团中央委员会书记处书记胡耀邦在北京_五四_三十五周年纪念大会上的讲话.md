Dear comrades:
Today, the youth of our entire nation are greeting the glorious combat "May Fourth" Youth Day with boundless excitement and joy, celebrating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, which inherits the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement and is forever loyal to the cause of the Party and the people.
Starting from the "May Fourth" Movement, for the past thirty-five years, our predecessors, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have fought heroically and endured countless hardships, transforming the old China into a new China and opening up an infinitely bright path for us. The youth of New China are now living in an era of unprecedented greatness and happiness. On this joyous festival, we pay tribute to the great and glorious Chinese Communist Party, to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, to the revolutionary elders, and to our most beloved leader and mentor, Chairman Mao.
Comrades, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has already achieved tremendous accomplishments. We are advancing towards socialism with giant strides, striving to build our country into a great and splendid socialist nation. This historical task has already been placed before the people of the entire nation. We, the youth, are inspired by this great cause and have put forward the slogan "Everything for Socialism." This is a sacred slogan. It expresses the youth's love for socialism, represents the youth's determination to fight for the realization of socialism, and at the same time, centrally reflects the supreme interests of the people of our country.
As everyone knows, to realize socialism, we must have a strong industry and advanced agriculture. But a strong industry and advanced agriculture cannot fall from the sky; they must be built by us with diligent hands and clever minds. That is to say: labor is the foundation for building socialism. "Everything for Socialism" means to labor heroically for the motherland.
We, the youth, are a mighty labor force. In our country, there are already millions of young people working in factories and mines, nearly a million young people participating in capital construction, tens of thousands of young people working in the national transportation sector, tens of thousands of young people prospecting for national resources, nearly two million young people teaching in schools at all levels, more than a million young people serving in state-owned businesses and cooperatives, more than two million young people working in various state organs, and nearly a hundred million young people working in rural areas. All of this labor, all of this work, is indispensable for building the motherland. All comrades who love their work, labor diligently and conscientiously, and all comrades who consciously link their daily labor with the great socialist goal are beneficial and contribute to the people.
Comrades, in New China, labor has become a heroic and grand undertaking. In labor, we can fully display our wisdom and exert our talents to realize our grand aspirations. Tens of thousands of ambitious ordinary young people, young children who were looked down upon in the old society, have now become experts in building socialism. For example: among the more than 260,000 young employees on the railways, more than 48,000 young people have become labor models and advanced workers. In the rural areas of Shanxi Province, according to statistics at the end of last year, more than 2,000 young people served as chairmen and vice-chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives. In the labor competitions of factories and mining enterprises, many young people have boldly displayed their innovative spirit, such as Comrade Wang Chonglun, who improved tools eight times, creating the "universal tool tire," completing four years' worth of work in one year; Comrade Li Bingzhong, who continuously improved and learned 17 kinds of jigs and fixtures and 24 kinds of cutters, completing three years' worth of work in one year; Comrade Huang Rongchang, who transformed woodworking manual operation into fully mechanized operation, creating 5 billion in wealth for the country each year; Comrade Liu Zuwei, a young assistant engineer, who continuously improved machine equipment, increasing production by more than 800 million yuan for the country each year; Comrades Han Guihua and Xu Xingdi, who could watch 1,400 spindles each, setting the national record; and Comrade Li Shaoqiang, the driver, who created the coal-saving operation method. Chen Hongzhi, an 18-year-old female worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in our capital, is bravely catching up with Wang Chonglun, increasing work efficiency by 4.6 times. In the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, our young agricultural production cooperative chairmen Chen Yike and Jiang Zaiqiu, and vice-chairman Shen Jilan, have always maintained their model honor. A large number of graduates from senior primary schools and some junior high school students who have entered agricultural production have played an important role in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in just one or two years, and some have even become chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives, such as Comrade Lü Genze from Jilin Province, Comrade Xu Jianchun from Shandong Province, Comrade Lü Yibao from Liaoxi Province, and Comrade Guo Tongxu from Shaanxi Province, all of whom are outstanding representatives. Among elementary school teachers, model teachers like Liu Fengxia have emerged. Among Young Pioneer instructors, model instructors like Liu Yuanzhang have emerged. Among typists, Comrade Shen Yunfen, who created the record of typing 3,337 characters per hour, has emerged. In addition, many advanced youth groups and advanced classes have emerged collectively. The youth of the Soviet Exhibition Hall construction site in our capital, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the construction site and the help of the trade union, and under the guidance of Soviet experts, established ten youth shock brigades. These shock brigades often over-fulfilled their tasks, and some increased their work efficiency by seven times. All these examples represent the excellent socialist qualities of the youth of New China, proving that they are energetic, patriotic, love labor, and are full of creativity.
Our motherland needs such youth. The youth of the whole country hope to learn from the advanced figures mentioned above. Comrades, we are capable of doing the things we undertake even better because the youth of New China have the infinite care of the Party and the People's Government, the patient guidance of the elders, and the entire society has an atmosphere of caring for the younger generation. As long as we can strive to improve, study diligently, constantly and humbly ask those around us for advice, and have the courage to overcome the difficulties in our progress, then we will definitely be able to achieve great results for the country.
In our country, there are now more than 55 million primary school students and more than 3.8 million university and secondary school students studying in schools. This is indeed a remarkable figure. Our New China's students are a powerful labor reserve force for building the motherland. All these students should earnestly master various scientific knowledge. When the motherland needs it, they should consciously devote themselves to the posts assigned by the motherland. This year, nearly five million senior primary and junior high school students will graduate across the country, and the motherland urgently needs a large part of them to directly participate in labor production, especially agricultural production. Because modernized industry and the socialist transformation of agriculture both require young people with certain cultural, scientific, and political awareness to learn technology and master technology. I believe that these graduating students will bravely shoulder this glorious responsibility.
Comrades, the cause of building socialism is so magnificent, so splendid, and this cause is so closely related to the interests of the people all over the world that it has been applauded and welcomed by the people of the world. One of the important reasons why our cause will surely be victorious is precisely because we have the support of the people of the world, especially the generous and selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union. But we must never forget that our cause has just begun, and there are still many difficulties and obstacles on our road forward. Imperialism still exists in the world, and the resolute counter-revolutionaries among the classes in our country who have been eliminated and will be eliminated will inevitably collude with imperialism and try their best to sabotage us. We must follow the teachings of the Party, strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country, and raise our political vigilance. We, the youth of New China, must not only be active builders of socialism, but also heroic defenders of our great motherland and world peace. Here, we especially want to mention the youth in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who, together with all the soldiers, defend the security of the country and the peace of the world, so that we can carry out construction with peace of mind. They are the models for Chinese youth and the example for us to learn from. We must support them with the greatest enthusiasm and congratulate them on their new achievements in their efforts to learn modern military technology and strive to build the best modern revolutionary army.
Our young Chinese New Democratic Youth League now has 470,000 grassroots organizations and 12 million members, who are distributed on all fronts of national construction, contributing their strength. Our Youth League members in factories and mines often appear in key positions, completing tasks with heroic labor. Seventy-five percent of our Youth League members in rural areas have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and they are also active organizers and participants in rural spare-time learning. Since the founding of the Youth League, it has sent more than 40,000 full-time cadres and more than 1 million grassroots cadres to the country; more than 620,000 of our Youth League members have gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. The Youth League has gained the trust of the people of the motherland and the broad masses of youth with its multifaceted work achievements, adding glory to the banner of the Youth League. But our work is not yet done well enough, and all our Youth League members should work better, study better, strictly abide by discipline, and accurately and exemplarily complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the country. Let others all say that there are absolutely no Youth League members who do not work well, do not have good discipline, or do not study well. Let young people feel that Youth League members are indeed people who are ahead of life, friends who can be trusted and can help themselves to embark on the right path. We must strive to ensure that wherever there are Youth League members, the youth there are active, there is a fiery passion for labor, there are warriors who overcome difficulties, there are united and friendly collectives, and there is definitely a high degree of patriotic and internationalist ideological sentiment. Our cadres must all study hard, go deep into reality, and do their work better. Under the leadership of the Party, let us all unite and work together to raise the glorious banner of the Youth League even higher.
Dear comrades, the Party and the people have high hopes for us, asking us to shoulder the glorious task of building socialism. We should have the same courage and skills as our predecessors to inherit and develop the great cause that they started. On this glorious festival, let us all make such a grand wish and hold such great ambitions: in our generation, we must build the motherland into a prosperous, strong, and great socialist country.
Long live our beloved motherland! Long live the great and glorious Chinese Communist Party! Long live our most beloved leader and mentor, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    立志作社会主义的积极建设者和保卫者
    ——中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦在北京“五四”三十五周年纪念大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    今天，我们全国的青年，都怀着无限兴奋和愉快的心情，来迎接中国青年光荣的战斗的“五四”青年节，来庆祝继承“五四”革命传统的、永远忠实于党和人民事业的中国新民主主义青年团成立的第五周年。
    从“五四”开始，三十五年来，我们的前辈，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，英勇奋斗，历尽千辛万苦，把旧中国变成了新中国，为我们打开了一条无限光明的道路。新中国的青年，现在是生活在空前伟大和幸福的时代里。在这个欢乐的节日，我们向伟大的光荣的中国共产党致敬，向英雄的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军致敬，向革命的长辈致敬，向我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席致敬。
    同志们，我们的祖国在共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经取得了巨大的成就，我们正大踏步地向社会主义前进，要把我国建设成为一个伟大的、光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。这个历史任务，已经摆在全国人民的面前。我们青年为这个伟大的事业所鼓舞，提出了“一切为着社会主义”的口号。这是一个神圣的口号，它表达了青年热爱社会主义的感情，代表了青年为实现社会主义而斗争的决心，同时，集中地反映了我国人民至高无上的利益。
    大家知道，要实现社会主义，就要有强大的工业和先进的农业，而强大的工业和先进的农业，不能从天上掉下来，是要靠我们用勤劳的双手和聪明的头脑去建设。这就是说：劳动是建设社会主义的基础。“一切为着社会主义”，就是要为祖国英勇地劳动。
    我们青年是一支劳动大军。在我们的国家里，现在已经有几百万个青年在工厂和矿山中做工，有近百万个青年参加了基本建设，有几十万个青年在国家的交通运输部门做事，有几万个青年正在为国家勘察富源，有近两百万个青年在各级学校中当教员，有一百多万个青年在国营商业和合作社中服务，有两百多万个青年在国家的各种机关中工作，有将近一万万个青年在农村里劳动生产。所有这些劳动，这些工作，都是建设祖国不可缺少的。所有热爱自己的工作、勤勤恳恳地、踏踏实实地劳动的同志，所有自觉地把日常的劳动和伟大的社会主义目标联结起来的同志，都是对人民有益处、有贡献的人。
      同志们，在新中国，劳动变成了一种英雄的豪迈的事业。在劳动中，我们能够充分地发挥自己的智慧，施展自己的才能，去实现我们宏大的志愿。成千成万个有志气的普通青年，在旧社会被瞧不起的年轻娃娃，现在已经成了建设社会主义的能手。例如：在铁道上的二十六万多个青年员工中，就有四万八千多个青年，成了劳动模范和先进工作者。在山西省农村中，根据去年年底的统计，就有两千多个青年当了农业生产合作社的社长和副社长。在厂矿企业劳动竞赛中，许多青年，大胆地发挥了革新精神，像王崇伦同志八次改进工具，创造“万能工具胎”，一年完成了四年的工作量；像李秉中同志，一连改进和学会了别人的工夹具十七种，刀具二十四种，一年可以完成三年工作量；像黄荣昌同志，把木工手工操作，改为全面机械化操作，每年可为国家创造五十亿财富；像青年助理工程师刘祖威同志，连续改进机器装置，一年可为国家增产八亿多元；像韩桂花和许杏娣同志，一人能看一千四百个纱锭，创造了全国最高纪录；像司机长李绍强同志，创造了省煤操纵法。我们首都石景山钢铁厂的十八岁女工陈鸿芝同志，正在勇猛地追赶王崇伦，把工作效率提高了四点六倍。在农业互助合作运动中间，我们年轻的农业生产合作社社长陈翊科、蒋在球同志，和副社长申纪兰同志，他们一直保持着模范的荣誉。投入农业生产的大批高小毕业生和一些初中学生，有许多仅仅在一两年内，就在农业生产合作社和互助组中，起到了重要的作用，有的还当了农业生产合作社的社长，像吉林省的吕根泽同志，山东省的徐建春同志，辽西省的吕宜宝同志，陕西省的郭统绪同志，都是出色的代表。在小学教员中，出现了像刘凤霞这样的模范教师。在少年先锋队辅导员中，出现了像刘元璋这样的模范辅导员。在打字员中，出现了创造一小时打三千三百三十七个字的沈蕴芬同志。此外，还涌现了许多集体的青年先进组、先进班。我们首都的苏联展览馆工地的青年，在工地党委的领导和工会的帮助下，在苏联专家的指导下，建立了十个青年突击队，这些突击队经常超额完成任务，有的把工作效率提高到七倍。所有这些事例，代表着新中国青年优秀的社会主义的品质，证明了他们是生气勃勃，热爱祖国，热爱劳动，富有创造精神的人。
    我们的祖国就是需要这样的青年。全国的青年都希望向上面所讲的那些先进人物学习。同志们，我们是能够把自己所承担的事情做得更好的，因为新中国青年有着党和人民政府无限的关怀，有着长辈们的耐心指导，整个社会有着关心年轻一代的风气。只要我们能够发奋上进，刻苦学习，不断地虚心向周围的人请教，有勇气打倒前进中的困难，那就一定能够为国家做出漂亮的成绩。
    在我们的国家里，现在有五千五百多万个小学生，有三百八十多万个大、中学生在学校中学习。这确实是一个了不起的数字。我们新中国的学生，是建设祖国的一支强大的劳动后备军。所有这些同学都应该认真地掌握各种科学知识。当祖国需要的时候，就要自觉地投到祖国分配的岗位上去。今年，全国将近有五百万个高小和初中同学要毕业，祖国迫切地需要他们中间的一大部分人，去直接参加劳动生产，特别是农业生产。因为近代化工业，和农业社会主义的改造，都要求具有一定文化科学知识和政治觉悟的青年，去学习技术，掌握技术。我相信，这些毕业同学，一定会勇敢地担当起这个光荣的责任。
    同志们，建设社会主义的事业是这样的雄伟，是这样的壮丽，这个事业，和全世界人民的利益，是这样地息息相关，这就得到了全世界人民的鼓掌欢迎。我们的事业之所以一定能够胜利，其重要原因之一，也正是因为有着全世界人民的支持，特别是有我们伟大的盟邦——苏联慷慨无私的援助。但是我们决不要忘记，我们的事业刚刚开始，在我们前进的道路上，还有重重的困难和障碍。世界上还有帝国主义存在，我们国内已被消灭和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，他们必然要和帝国主义相勾结，千方百计地来破坏我们。我们必须遵照党的教导，加强全国人民的团结，提高自己的政治警惕性。我们新中国的青年，不仅要做一个社会主义的积极建设者，而且要做一个伟大祖国和世界和平的英勇保卫者。在这里，我们特别要提出中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军中的青年，他们和全体战士一起，捍卫着国家的安全和世界的和平，使我们能够放手进行建设。他们是中国青年的模范和我们学习的榜样。我们要用最大的热情来支持他们，祝贺他们在努力学习现代化的军事技术上，得到新的成就，为建设一支最优良的现代化的革命军队而奋斗。
    我们年轻的中国新民主主义青年团，现在已经有四十七万个基层组织，有一千二百万个团员，他们分布在国家建设事业的各个战线，贡献着自己的力量。我们厂矿企业中的团员，经常出现在紧要的岗位上，用英勇的劳动去完成任务。我们农村中的团员，百分之七十五都参加了互助合作的组织，他们又是农村业余学习的积极组织者和参加者。青年团建团以来，已经向国家输送了四万多个专职干部，一百多万个基层干部；我们已有六十二万多个团员光荣地参加了中国共产党。青年团用自己多方面的工作成绩，得到了祖国人民和广大青年的信任，在青年团的旗帜上增加了光彩。但是我们的工作还做得不够，我们全体团员都应该更好地劳动，更好地学习，切实遵守纪律，准确地模范地去完成党和国家所交给的任务。让别人都会这样说，青年团员中，决没有劳动不好，纪律不好，学习不好的人。让青年人都这样感觉：青年团员的确是走在生活前面的人，是可以信赖、可以帮助自己走上正确道路的朋友。我们要努力做到：那里有青年团员，那里的青年就活跃，就有火一样的劳动热情，就有克服困难的勇士，就有团结友爱的集体，那里也就一定充满着崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的思想感情。我们的干部，都要努力学习，深入实际，把自己的工作做得更好。让我们全团在党的领导下，同心同德，一致努力，把青年团这面光荣的旗帜举得更高吧。
    亲爱的同志们，党和人民对我们怀着殷切的希望，要我们担负起建设社会主义的光荣任务，我们应该有前辈人同样的勇气和本领，来继承和发展从他们开始的伟大事业。在这个光荣的节日里，我们大家都来许下这样的宏愿和抱定这样的雄心：在我们这一代手里，一定要把祖国建设成一个繁荣、富强、伟大的社会主义国家。
    我们亲爱的祖国万岁！伟大的光荣的中国共产党万岁！我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛泽东同志万岁！
