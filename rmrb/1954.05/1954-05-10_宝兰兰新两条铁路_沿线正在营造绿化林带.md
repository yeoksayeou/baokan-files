Green belts are being created along the Baoji-Lanzhou and Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railways in the Northwest. In order to eliminate roadbed damage and supply wood for railway use, the railway management department has specially decided to create green belts along the Baoji-Lanzhou and Lanzhou-Xinjiang railways, under the principle of not hindering driving visibility and communication signal equipment. Currently, the task of planting trees in ten sections along the Baoji-Lanzhou line and 190 kilometers along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line has been completed. A total of more than 221,000 black locusts, white elms and other fast-growing and adaptable trees have been planted.

    宝兰兰新两条铁路
    沿线正在营造绿化林带
    西北的宝兰和兰新两条铁路沿线正在营造绿化林带。为了消除路基病害，供应铁路用木，在不妨碍行车了望及通讯信号设备的原则下，铁道管理部门特决定在宝兰、兰新两条铁路沿线营造绿化林带。现在已完成在宝兰线上十个间区及兰新线一百九十公里长的林木栽植任务。共栽种了二十二万一千多株生长迅速、适应性较强的洋槐、白榆等。
