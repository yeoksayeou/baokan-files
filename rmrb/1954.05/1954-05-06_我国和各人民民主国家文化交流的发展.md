The cultural exchange between our country and the people's democratic countries is developing rapidly. From the founding of the People's Republic of China to March 1954, our country has translated and published 203 books from Korea, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Mongolia and other countries, with a total print run of over 4.4 million copies. Among these publications, German books ranked first, including 33 classic works by Marx and Engels, with a total print run of more than 2 million copies.
