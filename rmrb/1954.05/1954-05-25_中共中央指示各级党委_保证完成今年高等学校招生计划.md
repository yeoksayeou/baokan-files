Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The CPC Central Committee issued a "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National College Enrollment Plan" to party committees at all levels on May 20th. The decision pointed out: This year's colleges and universities plan to enroll more than 90,000 students, but there are only more than 70,000 graduating senior high school students and students from workers and peasants' accelerated secondary schools nationwide. Considering that most of the new students enrolled this year will graduate in 1958, right at the end of the first Five-Year Plan and the beginning of the second Five-Year Plan, according to the current enrollment plan, the number of graduates at that time will be far from meeting the needs of construction, not to mention the quality. Therefore, this year's enrollment task must be fully completed and not reduced. Attention must also be paid to appropriately improving the quality of new students, and it cannot be lowered. In order to fully guarantee the completion of this year's college enrollment plan and appropriately improve the political, health, and cultural levels of new students, it is necessary to expand the sources of new students for colleges and universities from all aspects, ensuring that the number of applicants is not less than 110,000, so that colleges and universities can have some room for selection when admitting new students.

The decision pointed out: To achieve this requirement, the following measures must be taken: (1) Party committees at all levels should mobilize all graduating senior high school students and students from workers and peasants' accelerated secondary schools this year to apply for colleges and universities. Except for those who fail the entrance examination, none should be retained for other purposes. (2) Select 20,900 outstanding graduates from secondary vocational schools and employed professional cadres to enter colleges and universities of the same type. This number has been included in the quota for new students in each category and department this year, and relevant departments must guarantee its completion on schedule. When conditions permit, various departments should select employed cadres to replace the quota of the above-mentioned secondary vocational school graduates as much as possible. (3) Select 5,000 young cadres from party, government, and people's organizations at all levels above the county level nationwide to apply for various types of colleges and universities according to the regulations. (4) Select 300 demobilized soldiers to apply for various types of colleges and universities. Since the above selection of outstanding secondary vocational school graduates, employed professional cadres, and employed cadres from organs and organizations at all levels above the county level represents the actual number of students enrolled by colleges and universities, when selecting applicants, each region should generally select one-fifth more applicants.

The decision pointed out: Guaranteeing the completion of this year's college enrollment plan is not only necessary for cultivating and improving young cadres, but also an important link in guaranteeing the number and quality of future cadres to realize the national construction plan. All departments should focus on the overall interests of the country, overcome temporary difficulties, complete the assigned tasks, and ensure quality. The decision stipulates: Enrollment of employed cadres should be based on voluntary application. Leaders at all levels should select good employed young cadres to apply for the examination in a planned way. Those who are approved should be given time to review their lessons. Those who are admitted and meet the regulations will enjoy the treatment of transfer cadre subsidies. Those who fail the examination will still return to their original units, and the original sending unit shall not refuse to take care of them. The decision requires party committees at all levels to urge enrollment institutions at all levels to appropriately relax the admission standards for veteran cadres, especially worker-peasant cadres, according to the different nature of the schools they are applying for.

    中共中央指示各级党委
    保证完成今年高等学校招生计划
    【新华社二十四日讯】中共中央在五月二十日向各级党委发出“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”。决定指出：今年高等学校计划招生九万多人，但今年全国仅有高中毕业生和工农速成中学毕业生七万多人。鉴于今年所招新生多半在一九五八年毕业，正当第一个五年计划末期及第二个五年计划初期，按当前招生计划，届时毕业的学生不仅在质量上即在数量上也远不足以适应建设需要。因此，今年招生任务必须全部完成，不得减少。并须注意新生质量的适当提高，不能降低。为着全部保证完成今年高等学校招生计划并适当地提高新生的政治、健康及文化水平，必须从各方面扩大高等学校的新生来源，保证投考人数不得少于十一万人，使高等学校在录取新生时能略有选择的余地。
    决定指出：为达到这个要求，必须采取下列措施：（一）各级党委应动员今年高中和工农速成中学毕业学生全部报考高等学校，除经考试未被录取者外，一概不得留作他用。（二）选拔优秀的中等专业学校毕业生和在职的专业干部二万零九百人升入同类性质的高等学校，此项人数已计入各该类科系今年新生名额，有关部门必须保证如期完成。在条件许可时，各部门应尽可能选拔在职干部来代替上述中等专业学校毕业生的名额。（三）从全国县以上各级党、政、人民团体等各机关青年干部中按规定条件选送五千人报考各类高等学校。（四）从转业军人中选派三百人投考各类高等学校。由于以上选拔优秀的中等专业学校毕业生、在职的专业干部和县以上各级机关团体在职干部人数是高等学校实际录取人数，各地在选送报考人数时，一般应多选送五分之一的人数报考。
    决定指出：保证今年高等学校招生计划的完成，不仅是培养提高青年干部所必需，也是保证未来干部数量与质量实现国家建设计划的重要环节。各部门应从国家整体利益着眼，克服一时困难，完成所分配的任务，并要保证质量。决定规定：在职干部升学以自愿报考为原则，各级领导应有计划地选送好的在职青年干部投考，经批准者，应给予复习功课的时间。考取入学后，合乎规定者享受调干助学金待遇。其未考取者仍回原机关工作，原选送机关不得拒绝不管。决定要求各级党委督促各级招生机构对在职老干部特别是工农干部的录取标准应按报考学校的不同性质予以适当放宽。
