Various regions throughout the country have prioritized and promoted soil and water conservation work, achieving some initial successes. According to incomplete statistics from the Northwest and Northeast Administrative Regions, and Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, and other provinces, over 220,000 valley-stopping projects (including silt-retaining dams and gated gullies) have been completed. These projects can control a watershed area of 10,000 square kilometers, retain more than 30 million cubic meters of sediment, and create over 19,000 mu of silted land. Water storage and conservation projects in fields (such as reinforcing field ridges, digging contour ditches, and building terraces) have been completed over an area of more than 9,000 square kilometers. More than six million trees have been planted, 140,000+ mu of forests cultivated (excluding afforestation by forestry departments), 10,000 mu of grass planted, and more than 500 mu of seedlings cultivated. In addition, some areas have organized gully systems, which have slowed down flood discharge and protected houses and fields on both sides of the gullies and downstream, benefiting over one million mu of farmland. The key pilot projects in soil and water conservation in various regions have enabled farmers to initially understand the importance of transforming nature through labor and the relationship between soil and water conservation and agricultural production, and have played a certain role in promoting mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production.

Based on the existing achievements and experience, key pilot projects will continue to be carried out this year in selected areas within the Yellow River, Yongding River, and Yi-Shu River basins, as well as in Hebei, Shanxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other regions. The aim is to gradually gain comprehensive experience for full-scale implementation.

Currently, experimental research work in northern Shaanxi and eastern Gansu in the Yellow River basin is being actively prepared. In the Yongding River basin, a soil and water conservation construction institute has been established in Huai'an and has already begun work. The gully-stopping project in the Yaqian soil and water conservation experimental area in Yuexi County, Anhui, was basically completed at the end of March.

    各地水土保持工作获得初步成绩
    今年将继续在黄河永定河等流域重点试办
    全国已有不少地区重点推行了水土保持工作，获得了一些成绩。据西北、东北两大行政区和山东、河北、湖南等省不完全统计，属于谷坊一类的工程（包括留淤土坝、闸山沟等）完成了二十二万多座，可控制流域面积一万平方公里，拦沙三千多万立方公尺，淤地一万九千多亩。完成了田间蓄水保水工程（如培田埂、挖等高沟、修梯田等）九千余平方公里。植树六百余万株、造林十四万余亩（不包括林业部门的造林数字），种草一万亩、育苗五百多亩。加以部分地区对沟壑系统的整理，已减缓了洪水的下泄，保护了沟壑两岸及其下游的房屋田地，计受益农田达一百余万亩。各地水土保持工作的重点试办，使农民初步懂得了劳动改造自然的重要，水土保持工作与农业生产的关系，并对农业生产的互助合作，起了一定的促进作用。
    在已有成绩和经验的基础上，今年将在黄河、永定河、沂沭河等流域，以及河北、山西、湖南、广东、福建、安徽、四川、贵州等地区选择重点，继续进行试办，以求逐步取得全面开展的综合经验。
    目前，黄河流域陕北、陇东的试验研究工作正在积极筹备，永定河流域已在怀安成立水土保持施工所，并已开始工作。安徽岳西县衙前水土保持试验区的谷坊工程已于三月底基本完成。
