    The Birth of the Tianjiawan First Vegetable Production Cooperative
    Our Correspondent Bai Huai
    The first vegetable production cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an was established this spring. Now, on the wide, fertile land beside the Chan River, amidst the chest-high wheat fields, are scattered many rectangular patches of verdant vegetable plots. These are the newly planted vegetable seedlings of the cooperative this year. Garlic sprouts are already mature, and people are bundling them and loading them onto carts to take home. Tomato, cucumber, winter melon, celery, zucchini... all kinds of vegetable seedlings have grown up, shining green in the sun. The members are diligently digging vegetable ditches in the fields, transplanting the seedlings one by one into the ground.
    The Tianjiawan First Vegetable Production Cooperative has more than 200 mu of land, of which more than one-third is paddy field. Therefore, in past years, the people here, in addition to growing grain, also cultivated various vegetables, making it one of the vegetable-producing areas in the suburbs of Xi'an. However, in the past, on these 75 mu of paddy fields, the most that could actually be used for growing vegetables was only about 20 mu. The remaining 50 mu of fertile land was used as dry land. What was the reason for this? Just as Feng Tingxuan, the deputy director of the cooperative, said, growing vegetables is much more meticulous and complicated than growing other crops. In the past, individual farmers often couldn't manage it. Although they knew that using paddy fields as dry land wasted the soil's fertility and reduced income, they were truly "willing in spirit but lacking in strength." They always couldn't find a way to grow a few more mu of vegetables. Growing vegetables requires a lot of fertilizer and constant watering. Individual farmers couldn't prepare enough fertilizer, and even if they had fertilizer, they couldn't manage to water the fields every day. When the vegetables matured, the time spent in the fields became even greater. Individual farmers had to pick vegetables at least twice a day and carry them to the city to sell, which inevitably meant neglecting the plowing, weeding, and pest control of other grain crops. Take Wang Songnian, for example. He had 10 mu of paddy fields, but only one labor force. For many years, the vegetable fields he cultivated never exceeded two mu; the rest of the paddy fields were planted with wheat. One mu of paddy wheat could yield a maximum of 500 jin, while one mu of paddy vegetables could be worth 1,500 jin of grain. After deducting the processing and investment in the vegetable fields, one mu of paddy vegetables could yield at least 400 jin more grain than one mu of paddy wheat. He lost more than 3,000 jin of grain income every year. Even so, he was busy all year round and couldn't manage both ends. Therefore, although Tianjiawan Village had the natural conditions to develop vegetable production, the contradiction between labor and land, as mentioned above, couldn't be resolved reasonably before the organization of mutual aid and cooperation. As a result, the area of vegetable fields could not be expanded for many years.
    Last winter, the publicity of the general task of the national transition period blew like a spring breeze into Tianjiawan Village. People's eyes became brighter than before. From the many facts since liberation, they saw the rapid progress of national construction and the help and support of workers for their farmer brothers. Taking waterwheels as an example, in the past, among the more than 200 households in the whole village, only a dozen had waterwheels. Now, in the fourth natural village of Tianjiawan, with 84 households, every household's well has a waterwheel. The farmers also saw the socialist future of the countryside. In order to make more and better use of the paddy fields, increase income, and provide more vegetables to the worker brothers and cadres, many people were willing to organize and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation.
    However, when deciding to establish a vegetable production cooperative, many problems arose. The reason was that the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation in Tianjiawan Village was relatively weak in the past. At the same time, it was the first time to establish a vegetable production cooperative, and everyone had no experience. No one knew what it would be like after it was established. Therefore, not only did some people with more land have concerns, but some people with less land also had concerns. Those with less land worried that after joining the cooperative, they would have less land and receive less dividends in the future, which would affect their lives. After joining the cooperative, they couldn't immediately receive dividends and couldn't go out to do odd jobs to earn some pocket money. Those with more land were afraid that they would have more land and less labor, and they would suffer losses after deductions during the dividend distribution.
    At that time, the members made detailed calculations based on these concerns and the specific situation of Tianjiawan Village, explaining that neither those with more land nor those with less land would suffer losses after joining the vegetable production cooperative. Because the unified management of land and the concentrated use of labor first solved the difficulty of insufficient labor during decentralized management in the past. Those with more land could increase their income by more than double for every additional mu of paddy field by distributing according to the "land four labor six" system (note: because vegetable production cooperatives require more labor, the "land four labor six" distribution system may still have a slightly higher proportion for land). For example, Wang Songnian's 10 mu of paddy fields could only be cultivated for 2 mu each year in the past. Now, all 10 mu of paddy fields are planted with vegetables. Assuming that the average output value of one mu of vegetable land is 1,500 jin of grain, he can earn 4,800 jin more grain by planting 8 mu more of vegetable land, distributed according to the "land four labor six" system. Those with less land, if they join the vegetable production cooperative, it is equivalent to having their own land as long as they have labor. After careful calculations, the concerns of a few members began to be eliminated, which enabled the vegetable production cooperative to carry out production smoothly.
    During February and March this year, it was the busy farming season, and Tianjiawan Village was even more tense. People had to weed wheat, plant vegetable seedlings, weed vegetable fields, haul manure, and plow land. Many jobs were concentrated in this one period of time. The First Vegetable Production Cooperative showed its superiority for the first time at this time. This was particularly evident in the organization of labor. The women in the cooperative formed two groups, specializing in weeding onion seedlings. The technical group was responsible for planting various summer vegetable seedlings. The sideline group concentrated its efforts on transportation, sending hammered stones to the city and bringing back fertilizer from the city. In addition, two production groups were organized to specialize in weeding wheat and plowing land. This division of labor prevented the situation of neglecting one thing while attending to another, as in the past. More than 130 mu of wheat, which was originally planned to be weeded in ten days, was weeded in nine days, and it was weeded particularly clean. The vegetable cultivation was also more meticulous than in the past. Before plowing, all the vegetable fields were sprayed with "666" powder once, and after the vegetable seedlings were planted, they were sprayed again, which greatly reduced pest damage.
    The vegetable production cooperative has also signed a drug supply contract with the supply and marketing cooperative. If any pest damage occurs in the vegetable fields in the future, the supply and marketing cooperative will supply drugs in a timely manner. The Xi'an Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has also sent technical cadres to live in the cooperative for a long time, specializing in guidance, which provides a necessary guarantee for this year's vegetable production increase.
    Last year, an incident of throwing away winter melons occurred in Tianjiawan Village. The winter melons grew very well that year. When they were first harvested, everyone was reluctant to sell them immediately, wanting to store them for a few more days and wait for a good price. However, the harvest of winter melons was good that year, and there were many in the vegetable market, so the price never rose. Waiting and waiting, the originally white and large winter melons gradually became black and small, and even more unsalable. As a result, many families threw away their winter melons for nothing. This year, after the establishment of the cooperative, the issue of vegetable sales was studied, and a contract was signed with the district supply and marketing cooperative: after the vegetables are harvested, except for what the members eat themselves, the rest will be purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative at 70% (winter melons at 80%). The supply and marketing cooperative has also signed supply contracts with nearby factories, government agencies, and schools. Through the supply and marketing cooperative, not only is the sales of the vegetable production cooperative's products guaranteed, but also factories, government agencies, and schools are guaranteed to eat fresh vegetables in a timely manner.
    The Tianjiawan First Vegetable Production Cooperative has only been established for a short time, and there are still some problems in the organization of labor, evaluation of work and scorekeeping, and the proportion of land and labor. However, the labor enthusiasm of the members is very high. Not only are they confident in gradually solving these problems in production, but they also plan to plant all the paddy fields with vegetables next year, and some dry land that can be converted into paddy fields is also being prepared for conversion, to supply factories and cities with more and better vegetables year after year.

    田家湾第一蔬菜生产合作社的诞生
    本报记者  白槐
    西安市近郊第一蔬菜生产合作社，是在今年春天成立起来的。现在，在浐河岸傍的宽阔的肥沃的土地上，在齐胸深的麦地当中，到处镶嵌着很多块长方形的葱翠的菜地。这就是这个合作社今年新种的菜苗。蒜苗已经成熟了，人们正把它一捆一捆地装在车上运回家去。西红柿、黄瓜、冬瓜、芹菜、西葫芦……种种蔬菜的幼苗，都已成长起来，绿油油地在太阳底下闪光。社员们辛勤地在菜地上挖着菜沟，将幼苗一株一株地移植到地里。
    田家湾第一蔬菜生产合作社共有土地二百多亩，其中水地就在三分之一以上。因此，历年来这里的群众除种植谷物外，还经营着各种蔬菜，为西安市近郊产菜区之一。但是，过去在这七十五亩多水地上，每年真正能够用来种菜的，最多不过二十亩左右，其余的五十多亩肥沃的土地，都当旱地用了。这是什么原因呢？正像合作社副主任冯庭轩所说的一样，种菜比种其它庄稼细致复杂得多。过去，个体农民常常照顾不过来，虽然明明知道把水地当作旱地用，浪费了地力，减少了收入，但确实是“心有余而力不足”，想多种几亩菜总是没办法。种菜需要很多肥料，而且要随时浇，个体农民就不能准备充足的肥料，即使有了肥料，要每天往地里浇，怎么也照顾不过来。到蔬菜成熟了的时候，需要花在菜地里的时间就更多了，个体农民每天最少要到菜地里摘两次菜，还得挑到城里去卖，对其它粮食作物的整地、锄草、治虫等工作就必然要放松了。拿王松年来说，他有十亩水地，只有他一个劳动力，多少年来，他种的菜地都没超过两亩，其余的水地都种了小麦。一亩水地的小麦最多能收到五百斤，而一亩水地的菜能值一千五百斤粮食。除去在菜地上的加工和投资外，一亩水地的菜最少也比一亩水地的小麦能多收四百多斤粮食。他每年就要减少三千多斤粮食的收入。但就是这样，一年到头还把他忙得两头顾不上。因此，田家湾村虽然具备了发展蔬菜生产的自然条件，但是由于前面所说的劳力和土地的矛盾，在没有组织互助合作以前得不到比较合理的解决，因此，多年来菜地面积总不能扩大。
    去年冬天，国家过渡时期总任务的宣传，像春风一样吹到了田家湾村，人们的眼睛比过去更加明亮起来，他们从解放以后许多事实中，看到了国家建设事业的突飞猛进，看到了工人对农民兄弟的帮助和支援。就拿水车一项来说，过去安水车的在全村二百多户人家中，只有十几辆；现在，田家湾村第四自然村八十四户，每户的水井上都安上了水车。农民也看到了农村社会主义的前途，为了能更多更好地利用水地，增加收入，为了更多地供给工人弟兄和机关干部菜蔬，好多人都愿意组织起来，走互助合作的道路。
    但是，在决定办蔬菜生产合作社的时候，却发生了许多问题。原因是过去田家湾村互助合作基础比较薄弱，同时，又是第一次办蔬菜生产合作社，大家没有经验，究竟成立起来是个啥样，谁也不知道，因此，不仅一些地多的人有顾虑，就是一些地少的人也有顾虑。地少的耽心入社后，自己地少，将来分的红少，影响生活；入社后又不能马上分红，又不能出去打短工，挣点零用钱花；地多的怕自己地多、劳力少，将来分红时，三扣两扣自己吃亏。
  当时，社员们就根据这些顾虑和田家湾村的具体情况，算了一次细账，说明不论地多的和地少的参加了蔬菜生产合作社后都不会吃亏。因为土地统一经营、劳力集中使用，首先就解决了过去分散经营时劳力不足的困难，地多的按“地四劳六”的分配（按：蔬菜生产合作社因需要的劳力较多，地四劳六的分配制，可能土地占的比例还有些偏高），多一亩水地就能增加一倍以上的收入。如王松年的十亩水地，过去每年只能种二亩，现在十亩水地都种蔬菜，以一亩菜地平均产值一千五百斤粮食计算，他多种八亩菜地，按“地四劳六”分配，就可以多收入四千八百斤粮食。地少的加入蔬菜生产合作社，只要有劳力，也等于自己有土地一样。经过算细账后，少数社员的顾虑开始消除了，这样，就使蔬菜生产合作社顺利地进行生产。
    今年二、三月间，正是农忙季节，田家湾村更是十分紧张。人们一面要锄麦，一面又要下菜秧、薅菜地，还要拉粪、整地，好多活路都集中在这一个时间里。第一蔬菜生产合作社就在这时候第一次显示出来了它的优越性。这在组织劳力上表现得格外明显。社里的妇女们编了两个小组，专门薅葱秧，技术小组负责下各种夏菜秧，副业小组集中力量搞运输，把锤过的石子送到城里，再在城里运回肥料，另外还组织了两个生产小组，专门锄麦和整地，这样一分工，就不像往年那样顾了这头，顾不了那头了。原来计划十天锄完的一百三十多亩小麦，九天就锄完了，而且还锄得特别干净。在蔬菜的作务上也比过去细致，在开始犁地前，全部菜地里就洒了一次“六六六”药粉，菜秧栽上后，又普遍洒了一次，这就大大减低了虫害。
    蔬菜生产合作社还和供销合作社订立了药剂供应合同，如果将来菜地里发生什么虫害时，供销合作社就及时供应药剂。中共西安市委也派有技术干部长期住社，专门指导，使今年蔬菜增产有了必要的保障。
    去年，田家湾村曾发生一件扔冬瓜的事情。这年冬瓜长得十分好，刚收下的时候，大家都舍不得马上卖掉，想多放几天，等个好价钱再卖。可是这年冬瓜收成好，菜市上也多，价钱总没涨，就这样一等再等，原来又白又大的冬瓜也渐渐变得又黑又小了，更卖不出去。结果好多人家的冬瓜都白白地扔掉了。今年，合作社成立后，就研究了蔬菜销路问题，和区供销合作社订了合同：蔬菜下来后，除社员自己吃的以外，其余都按百分之七十（冬瓜按百分之八十）由供销合作社收购。供销合作社又和附近的工厂、机关、学校订立供应合同。经过供销合作社，不仅保证了蔬菜生产合作社的产品有销路，同时也保证了工厂、机关、学校能及时吃到新鲜蔬菜。
    田家湾第一蔬菜生产合作社刚成立不久，在组织劳力、评工记分、土地劳力占的比例等等方面，还存在着一些问题。但是，社员们的劳动热情都很高，他们不但有信心在生产中逐渐解决这些问题，而且，他们还计划明年把所有的水地都种上蔬菜，有些能变为水地的旱地也准备改造成水地，要一年比一年多地供给工厂、城市更多更好的蔬菜。（附图片）
