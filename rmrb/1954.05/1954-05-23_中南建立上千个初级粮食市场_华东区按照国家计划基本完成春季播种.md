    (Dispatch from Wuhan, May 22nd) The Central South Region is actively establishing primary grain markets managed by the state. Since late March, 1,510 grain markets have been established throughout the region. Active establishment is still underway.

    The establishment of grain markets in various regions has shown the following results: First, grain transactions have gradually become more active, further regulating the supply and demand of grain in rural areas. In Liqiaoji, Fifth District, Fugou County, Henan, a grain market was established on April 9th. On that day, 691 jin of grain were listed, of which 228 jin were mutually adjusted by the masses, and 463 jin were purchased by the state. On the 13th, 1,422 jin of grain were listed, an increase of 105 percent compared to the 9th, of which 424 jin were mutually adjusted by the masses, and 998 jin were purchased by the state. Due to the increase in the amount of grain listed, other agricultural products such as cotton, feed, and sweet potatoes have been stimulated to be listed in large quantities. Second, the state's grain supply burden has been reduced. For example, in Wolong District, Xiaogan County, Hubei, since the establishment of the grain market, the state's rice supply has decreased from an average of 3,379 jin per day in early April to 489 jin in late April through mutual adjustment by farmers. Third, farmers' production investment has been expanded. For example, farmers in Fengmiao Township, Zhengyang County, Henan, purchased 12 carts, 18 head of livestock, 2 seeders, and 20 plows after selling surplus grain in the market, actively investing in production.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 22nd) The spring sowing of crops in the East China Region has basically been completed in accordance with the national plan. The sown area of rice and other grain crops can reach the planned target. The sown area of cotton has exceeded the plan by more than 695,000 mu. The area of oil crops, peanuts, that has been sown and is ready to be sown is also close to the plan. Jute and kenaf have been sown, and flue-cured tobacco is being transplanted. The sown area of these two industrial raw material crops has been considerably expanded compared to last year.

    During the spring plowing and sowing season this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the East China Region has increased from 3,301 last winter to more than 26,000. There has also been a great development in year-round mutual aid teams and temporary mutual aid teams. Most of the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have formulated production plans according to local conditions in accordance with national requirements, and have also driven individual farmers to carry out spring plowing and sowing in accordance with national needs. In the Yangtze River Delta, which is suitable for rice cultivation, local farmers have expanded the rice planting area. North of the Huai River in Anhui Province, due to the construction of a large number of water conservancy projects in recent years, new rice-growing areas have also emerged this spring. In some areas of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces and areas with better water conservancy conditions on both sides of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, many farmers have changed from single-season rice to double-season rice. In the areas suitable for cotton planting, such as the banks of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, northern Jiangsu Province, and parts of Anhui Province, cotton fields have been expanded in a planned manner this year. The peanut sowing area of 210 agricultural production cooperatives in Wendeng and Laiyang Special Districts of Shandong Province has generally increased by more than 30 percent compared to last year.

    中南建立上千个初级粮食市场
    华东区按照国家计划基本完成春季播种
    【本报武汉二十二日电】中南区各地正积极建立由国家管理的初级粮食市场。全区自三月下旬到目前为止，已建立一千五百一十个粮食市场。现仍在积极建立中。
    各地建立粮食市场后，已显示如下成绩：第一，粮食交易逐渐活跃，进一步调剂了农村粮食供求。河南扶沟县五区李桥集四月九日建立粮食市场，当天上市粮食六百九十一斤，其中群众互相调剂的二百二十八斤，国家收购的四百六十三斤；十三日上市粮食一千四百二十二斤，比九日增加百分之一百零五，其中群众互相调剂的四百二十四斤，国家收购的九百九十八斤。由于粮食上市量增加，刺激了其他农产品如棉花、饲料、红薯等大量上市。第二，减轻了国家的粮食供应负担。如湖北孝感县卧龙区自建立粮食市场以来，经过农民互相调剂，国家的大米供应量由四月上旬每天平均供应三千三百七十九斤，降低为四月下旬的四百八十九斤。第三，扩大了农民的生产投资。如河南正阳县冯庙乡农民在市场出卖余粮后，购买大车十二辆、牲口十八头、耧二张、耕犁二十把，积极投入生产。
    【新华社上海二十二日电】华东区春季播种的农作物，已基本上按照国家计划完成。水稻及其他粮食作物的播种面积都可以达到预定计划。棉花的播种面积已经超过计划六十九万五千多亩。油料作物花生已经播种和准备播种的面积也接近计划。黄麻和洋麻已经播种完毕，烤烟正在移苗，这两种工业原料作物的播种面积都比去年有相当的扩大。
    今年春耕播种期间，华东区农业生产合作社已经由去冬的三千三百零一个增加到二万六千多个，常年互助组和临时互助组也有很大的发展。农业生产合作社和互助组大部分都根据国家的要求，因地制宜订出了生产计划，并带动单干农民也按照国家需要进行春耕播种。长江三角洲上适宜种植水稻，当地农民便扩大了水稻的种植面积。安徽省淮河以北地区，由于几年来大量水利工程的兴修，今春也出现了新的水稻地区。浙江、福建两省的部分地区和安徽省长江两岸水利条件较好的地区，很多农民把单季稻改为双季稻。在适宜植棉的山东省黄河两岸、江苏省北部和安徽省的一部分地区，今年都有计划地扩大了棉田。山东省文登、莱阳两个专区二百一十个农业生产合作社的花生播种面积，一般都比去年增加百分之三十以上。
