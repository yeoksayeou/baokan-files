    Letter from the Swedish and Swiss Members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the Military Armistice Commission on May 7th
    The Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission addressed a letter to the Military Armistice Commission on May 7, 1954. The full text is as follows:

    Military Armistice Commission:

    As the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission undertakes its duties of supervision, observation, inspection, and investigation, the United Nations Command side and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army side have made their own decisions on how to implement the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the rotation of personnel and the replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition. These two tasks are the most important responsibilities of this Commission. Later, as stipulated in paragraphs 13c and 13d of the Armistice Agreement, both sides reached an agreement on fulfilling their obligations to report such (personnel and material) movements to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. As for other methods, especially those used for each port, they are left to the two sides themselves.

    From the beginning, the United Nations Command side has taken a broad view of its obligations, allowing Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in its military control areas to conduct full supervision. Partly on its own initiative and partly upon request, that side has submitted all documents concerning the entry and exit of combat and non-combat materials, such as manifests and outward clearance certificates, for use by the Inspection Teams. Therefore, the Inspection Teams can inspect and report on any materials in which they are interested. They are thus free to inspect many items, such as trainer aircraft parts, explosives, and various other objects that the United Nations Command itself does not consider to be within the scope of the Armistice Agreement. No restrictions have been placed on the Inspection Teams' supervisory activities. On the contrary, they have been given full access and the right to examine any documents they want to consult. The Inspection Teams have also fully utilized these privileges.

    On the other hand, the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army side has adopted a rigid method of strictly reporting combat materials passing through ports in its military control areas. Apart from prior notifications, it has never submitted any other documents for inspection. Besides inspecting properly reported combat materials, the Inspection Teams cannot effectively supervise other movements. This is due to the position taken by the Czechoslovak and Polish members. According to the opinions of the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the task of this Commission is, in principle, limited to inspecting combat materials reported by both sides. However, they have also acknowledged the method of spot-check inspections. But in the areas under the military control of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Inspection Teams have used their "veto" power, resulting in very few spot-check inspections being conducted. All efforts made by the Swedish and Swiss members of the Inspection Teams to increase the scope and frequency of spot-check inspections have been consistently and resolutely thwarted. Because of the way it is conducted, spot-check inspection has become a face-saving measure lacking any real significance. Therefore, the Inspection Teams in the North have never been able to conduct as in-depth inspections of material movements as the Inspection Teams in the South.

    It must also be noted that among the areas under the military control of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, only two ports, namely Sinuiju and Manpo, have been reported to have military personnel rotations and combat material replacements. The other three ports designated in the Armistice Agreement, namely Chongjin, Hungnam, and Sinanju, have remained inactive, even though they are connected by rail to areas outside the northern border of Korea. The Czechoslovak and Polish members have, in principle, refused to agree to regular spot-check inspections at those railway stations, claiming that all movements there should be considered inland transportation.

    From the beginning, the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have argued that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams should be given the broadest possible scope to supervise the movement of all outbound and inbound materials at each port. Since their opinions have not prevailed over the opinions of Czechoslovakia and Poland, they have insisted that supervisory activities on both sides of the Demilitarized Zone be treated at least equally. The new methods recently adopted by the United Nations Command side make this possible. This method is almost exactly the same as the method used from the beginning by the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army side.

    However, one aspect of the situation remains unsatisfactory. The spot-check inspections in the areas controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are not only completely nominal but are also only conducted at railway stations in two ports. There is still no supervision at the stations in the other three ports. This situation cannot be considered in accordance with the task given to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    Since it has been further claimed that no materials are shipped out of or into Korea through these ports, and thus it seems that there is no sufficient reason to retain them, the Swedish and Swiss members recommend that the commanders of the opposing sides consider replacing the three ports of Chongjin, Hungnam, and Sinanju with other locations that actually have railway lines crossing the northern border of Korea. Only through such adjustments can the situation in the North be made comparable to the current situation in the South in terms of the number of locations where spot-checks can be conducted.

### 中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员五月七日给军事停战委员会的信

    中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员五月七日给军事停战委员会的信
    中立国监察委员会瑞典委员和瑞士委员在一九五四年五月七日致函军事停战委员会，全文如下：军事停战委员会：
    在中立国监察委员会承担其监督、观察、视察和调查的职司之际，联合国军方面与朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面对如何实施停战协定中关于人员的轮换以及作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器、弹药的替换的条款作出了自己的决定，而该两项工作就是本委员会最主要的责任，以后如停战协定第十三款寅项和第十三款卯项所规定的，双方对于执行它们的有关向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会报告此等（人员与物资）移动的一些义务达成了协议，至于其他办法尤其是那些用于各口岸的则听由双方自己。
    联合国军方面从开始便对其义务采取了广义的看法，让驻在其军事控制地区的中立国视察小组得以进行充分的监察。该方部分出于它自己的主动，部分是经过要求，已把所有关于进出的作战与非作战物资的文件，如船货单和出港证等提出供视察小组使用。所以视察小组就能视察，并报告他们对之发生兴趣的任何物资，他们因而得以自由地检查，诸如教练机零件、炸药以及其他各种联合国军自己并不认为系属于停战协定范围之内的许多物件，对各视察小组的监察活动并未加以限制，反之倒曾给予他们以充分接触，和他们要查阅任何文件之权，各视察小组也充分利用了这些特权。
    在另一方面，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面则采取了严格报告通过其军事控制地区各口岸的作战物资的死板办法，它除了事先通知以外从来没有提交过任何其他文件供视察，除了视察恰当地报告了的作战物资以外，视察小组不能有效地监察其他的移动，而这是由于捷克斯洛伐克组员和波兰组员所采取的立场，依照中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员的意见，本委员会的任务在原则上是只限于视察双方所报告了的作战物资，然而他们也承认了抽查监察的办法，但是在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军实行军事控制的地区，各视察小组的捷克斯洛伐克组员和波兰组员利用自己的“否决”权，使得抽查监察只进行了极少的几次。各视察小组的瑞典组员和瑞士组员为了增加抽查监察范围和次数所作的一切努力经常地和坚决地被挫败了，由于进行的方式使得抽查监察只成为一种保存体面的办法而缺乏任何真正的意义，因此在北方的各视察小组从来就没有能像在南方的各视察小组那样地可以深入查看物资的移动。
    还须注意的是在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军军事控制下地区的报告过有军事人员轮换与作战物资替换的只有两个口岸即新义州和满浦，停战协定中所指定的其他三个口岸即清津、兴南和新安州则一直没有活动，虽然它们和朝鲜北面国境以外的地区是有铁路相联的，而捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员则在原则上拒绝同意在那些火车站进行经常的抽查监察，他们声称那里的一切移动都应被认为是内陆交通。
    中立国监察委员会的瑞典委员和瑞士委员从一开始即主张应给予各中立国视察小组以最宽的范围来监察各口岸一切出境与入境物资的移动，由于他们的意见未能胜过捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的意见，他们就坚持了至少要平等对待在非军事区两边的监察活动，联合国军方面最近采用的新办法使这一点成为可能，这种办法与朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面一开始即使用的办法几乎是完全一样的。
    然而有一方面的情况还是不令人满意的，在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面控制下地区内的抽查监察不仅是完全有名无实，而且是只在两个口岸的火车站上进行着，对其他三个口岸的车站仍然没有监察，这种情况是不能认为符合于给予中立国监察委员会的任务的。
    既然又进一步地声称过没有物资经由这些口岸运出和运入朝鲜，从而也就好像没有什么充足理由来保留它们，瑞典委员和瑞士委员建议敌对双方司令官考虑将清津、兴南和新安州三个口岸换到别的实际上有铁路线跨过朝鲜北方国境的地点去，只有通过这样的调整才能在可以进行抽查该地点的数目上使北方的情况能以和南方现行的情况相比。
