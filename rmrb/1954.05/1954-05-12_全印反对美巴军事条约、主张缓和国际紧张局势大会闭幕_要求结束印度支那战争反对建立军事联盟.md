Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th - The All-India Conference Against the US-Pakistan Military Treaty and Advocating for the Relaxation of International Tensions, which opened in New Delhi on the 7th, closed on the afternoon of the 9th after three days of meetings. The conference unanimously passed eight resolutions.

    The resolution regarding the "US-Pakistan Military Treaty" stated: The conference firmly opposes the US-Pakistan military "aid" treaty because this treaty threatens the security of Asian countries and world peace, and exacerbates international tensions. After pointing out the harm of this treaty to the people of Pakistan and India, the resolution stated that this treaty "also makes it more difficult than before to peacefully resolve Indo-Pakistani disputes through direct consultation." The resolution expressed support for Prime Minister Nehru's refusal to accept Eisenhower's suggestion of military "aid" and supported the Indian government's request to withdraw the American observers in Kashmir.

    The resolution on "Asian Issues" passed by the conference stated: The success of the Geneva Conference is of great significance to world peace. The resolution stated: "The conference expresses its regret that many Asian countries deeply concerned with Asian issues could not participate in the Geneva Conference. The conference welcomes the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference. The conference firmly believes that the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations Organization must be recognized. If China's 500 million people cannot express their opinions in the world organization, peace cannot be guaranteed."

    When discussing the issue of Indo-China, the resolution expressed support for Prime Minister Nehru's suggestions on the Indo-China issue and the Indian government's position of not allowing planes carrying foreign troops to fly over Indian territory. The resolution stated: "The conference demands an immediate end to the Indo-China War, demands complete freedom for Indo-China, and guarantees that it will not be subject to foreign interference. The conference believes that only direct negotiations between the belligerent countries after a ceasefire can promote the formation of a peaceful atmosphere."

    The resolution then expressed deep sympathy for the long-term suffering experienced by the Korean people during the war. The resolution believes that "steps should be taken immediately to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War and to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, so that the Korean people can freely determine their own destiny." The resolution also "calls on the countries concerned to fulfill the international obligations made to the heroic Korean people regarding making their country independent and unified."

    The resolution stated: "The conference calls on the major powers now meeting in Geneva to respect the rights of self-determination and complete independence of the Asian people as the basis for establishing peace in Asia."

    The resolution continued: "The conference condemns all military actions and alliances aimed at endangering the freedom of Asian countries, because they are an attack on the increasingly strengthened unity of the peoples of Asian countries." The resolution stated: "Asian issues cannot be permanently resolved without the full and legitimate participation and cooperation of Asian countries. The awakened Asia can no longer be ignored when considering world affairs."

    Another resolution of the conference condemned hydrogen bomb tests and demanded the prohibition of hydrogen bombs and all weapons of mass destruction.

    The resolution on "Economic Relations as a Means of Easing International Tensions" pointed out that obstructing normal trade between countries hinders peaceful relations and cooperation between countries, and deteriorates people's living standards and reduces employment. The resolution on "Cultural Relations" demanded the removal of all obstacles hindering the development of cultural relations between peoples of all countries. The conference also passed resolutions on "Colonialism and Racism" and on "Foreign Territories within India."

    The final resolution of the conference pointed out the achievements of the conference's work and believed that rallies should be held in various provinces of India to publicize the resolutions to the people.

    全印反对美巴军事条约、主张缓和国际紧张局势大会闭幕
    要求结束印度支那战争反对建立军事联盟
    【新华社新德里十一日电】全印反对美巴军事条约、主张缓和国际紧张局势大会自七日在新德里开幕后，经过三天的会议，已于九日下午闭幕。大会一致通过了八项决议。
    关于“美巴军事条约”的决议说：大会坚决反对美巴军事“援助”条约，因为这个条约威胁亚洲各国的安全和世界和平，并加剧国际紧张局势。决议在指出这个条约对巴基斯坦和印度人民的危害以后说，这个条约“还使得通过直接协商来和平解决印巴纠纷比以前更困难了”。决议表示支持尼赫鲁总理拒绝接受艾森豪威尔给予军事“援助”的建议，并拥护印度政府提出的撤退在克什米尔的美国观察员的要求。
    大会通过的关于“亚洲问题”的决议中说：日内瓦会议的成功对世界和平有着重大的意义。决议说：“大会对于许多深切关怀亚洲问题的决定的亚洲国家不能参加日内瓦会议表示遗憾。大会欢迎中华人民共和国代表参加日内瓦会议。大会坚决认为中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的合法地位一定要得到承认。如果中国的五亿人民不能在世界组织中发表意见，和平是得不到保证的。”
    在谈到印度支那问题时，决议表示支持尼赫鲁总理关于印度支那问题的建议和印度政府采取的不许载运外国军队的飞机飞越印度国境的立场。决议说：“大会要求立刻结束印度支那战争，要求给印度支那以完全的自由，并保证它不受到外国的干涉。大会认为只有在停火以后由交战国之间举行直接谈判才可以促进和平气氛的形成。”
    决议接着对朝鲜人民在战时所经历的长期的痛苦表示深切的同情。决议认为应“立刻采取步骤来防止朝鲜战争的再起，并保证所有外国军队从朝鲜撤退，以使朝鲜人民能够自由决定他们自己的命运。”决议并“要求有关国家应履行对英勇的朝鲜人民所作的关于使他们的国家获得独立与统一的国际义务。”
    决议说：“大会要求现在在日内瓦开会的各大国尊重亚洲人民的自决与完全独立的权利，作为建立亚洲和平的基础。”
    决议继续说：“大会斥责所有以危害亚洲国家自由为目的的军事行动和联盟，因为它们是对亚洲各国人民日益加强的团结的进攻。”决议表示：“没有亚洲国家充分地与合法地参加和合作，有关亚洲的问题是不可能获得永久的解决的。在考虑世界事务时，再也不能忽视觉醒了的亚洲了。”
    大会的另外一项决议斥责氢弹试验，并要求禁止氢弹及一切大规模毁灭性的武器。
    关于“经济关系是缓和国际紧张形势的手段”的决议指出：阻碍国际间的正常贸易，就是妨碍国际间的和平关系与合作，并且使得人民的生活水平恶化、就业人数减少。关于“文化关系”的决议要求打破阻碍各国人民间文化关系发展的一切障碍。大会还通过了关于“殖民主义与种族主义”和关于“印度境内国外属地”的决议。
    大会最后的决议指出了大会的工作成就，并认为应在印度各省举行集会向人民宣传各项决议。
