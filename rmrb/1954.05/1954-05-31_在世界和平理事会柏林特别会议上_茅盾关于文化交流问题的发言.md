(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin) World Peace Council member and Chinese writer Mao Dun delivered a speech on cultural exchange at the afternoon session of the World Peace Council Special Session in Berlin on the 28th. The full text is as follows:
Dear friends,

The World Peace Council has continuously called for extensive development of cultural exchanges between countries, which is very necessary to enhance mutual understanding and respect between peoples of all countries, and thereby promote friendship between them. At the same time, the development of cultural exchanges between countries will play a significant role in further easing international tensions. The World Peace Council has repeatedly suggested and called on the people of all countries to adopt various methods to effectively achieve the exchange of science, literature, and art.

In recent years, the people of all countries have made great efforts for the cause of cultural exchange. Although we have encountered many obstacles and there are still many difficulties in front of us, it should be said that the cause of cultural exchange between countries has made considerable progress and achieved remarkable results. The question is that we must continue our efforts to move further forward on the existing foundation.

Here, please allow me to talk about some of the main facts of cultural exchanges between the Chinese people and other countries in the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. These facts clearly prove that the call of the World Peace Council and the resolutions passed at its previous sessions are not only correct and very necessary, but also show that with the continuous efforts of cultural organizations and individuals in various countries, it is entirely possible to carry out international cultural exchanges in order to help further ease international tensions.

First, I would like to mention the exchanges of cultural groups and individuals, which is an important symbol of friendly relations between peoples and one of the main ways of cultural exchange.

In recent years, mutual visits between our people and the people of various countries have been continuous and increasing year by year. Hundreds of delegations from our country's science, literature, art, sports, women, youth, students, and trade unions have visited countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. These delegations were not only warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people in the Soviet Union and people's democracies, but also warmly welcomed by cultural groups and people from all walks of life in many other countries, leaving a deep impression among them. On the other hand, in the past few years, representatives from more than fifty countries have visited our country more than three hundred times. Among these distinguished guests, many are social leaders, famous cultural figures, and international peace fighters from various countries. Among them are Indian writers and poets, Indonesian composers and journalists, Japanese actors and painters, Burmese historians, Pakistani and Ceylonese religious leaders, Australian and African social activists, as well as famous American writers, scientists, and doctors, British religious and scientific authorities and economic figures, famous German and French writers, Italian philosophy professors, scientists and film directors, and famous scientists and social activists from Northern European countries, etc. In our capital Beijing, in major cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, at the Huai River construction site, at the Yangtze River construction site, in various cultural, educational, and artistic institutions, and in rural nurseries, they saw everything they wanted to see and were warmly welcomed by our people.

Here, it is worth mentioning that our country and neighboring countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia have exchanges of delegations of various natures. In terms of cultural nature alone, our country and India have exchanged two fairly large cultural delegations in two or three years, and both cultural delegations have visited and toured the other's vast territory, contacting tens of thousands of people.

Mutual visits by art and dance troupes have had a tremendous effect on enhancing friendship and cultural exchange between peoples of all countries. For example, in 1952, the Chinese People's Acrobatic Troupe toured 67 cities in Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. The Chinese Youth Art Troupe performed in theaters and squares in Budapest, Berlin, and Vienna, allowing hundreds of thousands of European audiences to appreciate the people's art from the new China for the first time. In 1953, the Indian Art Delegation visited China and gave public performances in many cities in our country, which were greatly welcomed. The broad masses of Chinese audiences appreciated the classical dances and music in Indian national forms with joy and excitement. Just as they warmly welcomed Ulanova's outstanding art, welcomed the Soviet Army Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble, the Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, and the beautiful performances in national forms by song and dance ensembles from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Mongolia, and other countries.

In addition to mutual visits by delegations, we have also done other forms of cultural exchange work.

In the past few years, we have organized more than 220 exhibitions of various natures and exhibited them around the world. At the same time, our cultural groups have also assisted the people of various countries in holding more than 50 different types of exhibitions in our country. Soviet films and films from people's democracies have become the daily spiritual food of Chinese audiences, and Chaplin's excellent and outstanding works enjoy a high reputation among the broad masses of audiences in our country. Films from Italy and Japan have also recently met with the Chinese people. At the same time, films reflecting the struggle and new life of our people have been shown in sixty countries. The National Beijing Library and other cultural and educational institutions in our country have established regular exchanges of books and various cultural materials with cultural and scientific institutions in eighteen countries, including the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, India, and Sweden.

In terms of translating and publishing progressive scientific and literary works from various countries, our country has also made its greatest efforts in recent years. People can see translations of modern scientific masterpieces and literary masterpieces from the Soviet Union and people's democracies, as well as other countries, in bookstores and public libraries throughout our country; they can see newly revised translations from the original text of Dante's "Divine Comedy," Aristophanes' comedies, the complete works of Shakespeare's plays, and other European classical literature; they can also see recently translated and published works by outstanding peace fighters. This includes the long or short works of poets and novelists who have won the International Peace Prize from previous sessions of the World Peace Council.

The Chinese people warmly responded to the World Peace Council's call to commemorate world cultural figures. Since 1952, grand commemorative meetings have been held, exhibitions have been held, commemorative essays have been published in newspapers and periodicals, and cultural representatives from relevant countries have been invited to participate in our capital Beijing and other cities. Just a few days ago, on May 24th, a conference commemorating the great Czech composer Dvořák was held in our capital, and his works were played.

In order to meet the needs of the cause of international cultural exchange, the "Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries" was announced in our capital Beijing some time ago. Many famous figures in the Chinese science, literature, and art circles are members of the association. Through it, our cultural relations with various countries in the world will surely be able to achieve greater development in the future.

The Chinese people respect and love the cultural traditions of their own country, and at the same time treat the cultural traditions of other countries with the same respect and love, as well as the spiritual wealth created by the great ancestors of all peoples, which is shared and owned by all mankind. The Chinese people, with a sincere attitude and warm expectations, are willing to strengthen cultural exchanges with the people of all countries in the world. The Chinese people extend a friendly hand to friends who love peace and respect their own and others' national cultures, and welcome them to take a look at our people's peaceful construction in industry and agriculture over the past four years; to take a look at our national dramas and folk songs and dances that are "letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new"; to take a look at the Great Wall, one of the wonders of the world; to take a look at the magnificent Yungang Grottoes from thousands of years ago, as well as the more than 3,000 pieces of bronzes, pottery, porcelain, gold ornaments, sculptures, and other precious cultural relics (which came with our large-scale basic construction projects) excavated recently from the Shang and Zhou dynasties to the Ming Dynasty; to take a look at the southern scenery where spring is all year round and the picturesque West Lake.

Dear friends, a Chinese ancient philosopher once said this sentence: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." The other side of this sentence is to respect oneself and also respect others. We Chinese people follow this sentence. We respect and cherish our own national culture, and precisely because we respect and cherish our own national culture, we believe that the national cultures of all other countries must also be respected and cherished. In the past century, the Chinese people have suffered not only political and economic aggression, but also cultural aggression. Our ancient cultural relics have been plundered and destroyed, and our children have been poisoned. Precisely because we have had such experience, we firmly support the World Peace Council's call to defend national culture. We believe that defending national culture and cultural exchange are not opposed to each other, but are mutually reinforcing, mutually beneficial, and mutually beneficial. Cultural exchange can make world culture a cultural park where all flowers bloom and are evergreen.

Dear friends, peace, friendship, culture—these beautiful and solemn things—like sunshine and air, are indispensable elements for the normal life of mankind, and therefore cannot be rejected or blocked. Who can reject the genius creations and inventions of the working people and advanced scholars of various countries for thousands of years? Who can block the calls for peace and defense of culture that are resounding all over the world today? The power of the people has been creating, protecting, disseminating, exchanging, and developing brilliant human culture; at the same time, it is also resolutely combating those ugly pig snouts that have stretched into the cultural orchard and those shameful clamoring that instigate war. In this noble cause, the people of New China are inheriting the spirit of our great ancestors and are making unremitting efforts together with the people of all countries. Friends, let us remember the following words from the World Peace Council's resolution on cultural exchange at the previous Vienna meeting: "If every organization and individual that cherishes its own culture and world culture is determined to establish contact and work to establish fruitful international exchanges on the basis of mutual exchange, then the future is unlimited."

Let us move forward along the road of the great cultural traditions of all mankind and the friendship of the people! In order to make the sunshine and air of human culture warmly shine and bathe the earth, and in order to make the hearts of the people of all countries grow with unfading, beautiful springs and brilliant hope, and in order to further ease international tensions and quickly realize collective security, let us all redouble our efforts!

    在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上
    茅盾关于文化交流问题的发言
    【新华社柏林讯】世界和平理事会理事、中国作家茅盾在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议二十八日下午会议上作了关于文化交流问题的发言。全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    世界和平理事会曾经不断地号召：为了增进各国人民之间的互相了解与互相尊重、并从而促进各国人民之间的友谊广泛地发展，各国间的文化交流是非常必要的。同时各国的文化交流的发展，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势必将起着重大的作用。世界和平理事会曾屡次建议和号召各国人民采取各种各样的方法，以期有效地达成科学、文学和艺术的交流。
    近年以来，各国人民对于文化交流事业都曾作了巨大的努力。尽管我们曾遇到许多障碍并且横在我们面前还有不少的困难，但应该说，现在各国间的文化交流事业，已经有了相当大的发展并获得了显著的成就。问题是在我们必须继续努力在已有的基础上更前进一步。
    在这里请容许我谈一谈中国人民在中华人民共和国成立以来的四年间和世界各国所进行的文化交流的一些主要事实。这些事实清楚地证明，世界和平理事会的号召和它的历届会议所通过的各项决议不仅是正确的和非常必要的，而且说明了在各国的文化组织及个人的不断努力之下，开展国际文化交流以期有助于国际紧张局势之进一步缓和是完全可能的。
    首先，我愿提到作为各国人民间友好关系的重要标志和文化交流的主要方式之一的——文化界团体和个人的来往。
    这几年来，我国人民和各国人民的相互访问是络绎不绝的。而且一年年在增进着。数以百计的我国的科学、文学、艺术、体育、妇女、青年、学生以及工会的代表团，曾到亚洲、欧洲和美洲各国访问。这些代表团不仅在苏联和人民民主国家受到广大人民的热烈欢迎，而且在其他许多国家的文化团体及各阶层人民群众中也受到热烈的欢迎。在他们中间留下深刻的印象。另一方面，在过去的几年中有五十多个国家的代表们来我国作了三百多次的访问，这些贵宾中颇有不少是各国的社会领袖、文化界著名人士和国际和平战士。他们中间有印度的作家和诗人，有印尼的作曲家和记者，有日本的演员和画家，有缅甸的历史学家，有巴基斯坦和锡兰的宗教界领袖，有澳洲和非洲的社会活动家，也有美洲的著名作家、科学家和医生，有英国的宗教界、科学界的权威人士和经济界人士，有德国和法国的著名作家，有意大利的哲学教授、科学家和电影导演，有北欧各国的著名科学家和社会活动家等等。他们在我们首都北京，在上海、武汉、杭州、广州等各大城市，在淮河工地，在长江工地，在各种文化、教育、艺术机构，在农村托儿所，他们看到了他们所愿意看的一切，受到了我国人民热情的欢迎。
    在这里，值得特别提一提的是，我国和印度、缅甸、印尼等邻国都有各种性质的代表团来往。单就文化性质的来说，我国和印度在二、三年间就交换过两次规模相当大的文化代表团，双方的文化代表团都曾在对方的广大国土上参观、访问，接触了成千成万的群众。
    艺术和歌舞团的互相访问，在增进各国人民之间的友谊和文化交流方面，曾收到了巨大的效果。例如：在一九五二年，中国人民杂技团曾在芬兰、丹麦、瑞典三个国家的六十七个城市内巡回演出。中国青年文艺工作团曾在布达佩斯、柏林与维也纳的剧院和广场演出，使得数十万的欧洲观众第一次欣赏了来自新中国的人民艺术。一九五三年，印度艺术代表团访问中国，在我国许多城市公演，受到了很大的欢迎，中国广大观众以喜悦和兴奋的心情，欣赏了印度的民族形式的古典舞蹈和音乐。正如他们热烈地欢迎乌兰诺娃的卓越艺术、欢迎苏联的苏军红旗歌舞团、波兰的玛佐夫舍歌舞团以及匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜、蒙古等国家的歌舞团的民族形式的优美演出一样。
    除了代表团的互相访问，我们还做了其他方式的文化交流工作。
    在过去几年中，我们组织二百二十多个各种性质的展览会，在世界各地展出。同时，我国各文化团体也协助各国人民在我国举办了五十多个不同种类的展览会。苏联电影和人民民主国家的电影，已经成为中国观众每日的精神食粮，卓别麟的优秀出众的作品，在我国广大观众中享有崇高的声誉。意大利和日本的影片，最近也和中国人民见面了。同时，反映我国人民的斗争和新生活的影片也已在六十个国家放映。我国的国立北京图书馆及其他文化教育机构，已和苏联、德意志民主共和国、印度、瑞典等十八个国家的文化科学机构，建立了经常的图书和各种文化资料的交换关系。
    在翻译和出版世界各国进步的科学和文学作品方面，我国近年来也尽了最大的努力。人们在我国各地的书店和公共图书馆里，可以看到苏联和人民民主国家以及其他国家的现代科学名著和文学杰作的译本；可以看到重新校订的从原文翻译的但丁的“神曲”、阿里斯多芬的喜剧、莎士比亚戏剧全集以及其他的欧洲古典文学的译本；也可以看到最近翻译出版的杰出的和平战士们的著作。这中间包括了获得世界和平理事会历届国际和平奖金的诗人和小说家们的长篇或短篇著作。
    中国人民热烈地响应了世界和平理事会纪念世界文化名人的号召。从一九五二年以来，在我国首都北京和其他城市都举行了隆重的纪念大会、举办了展览会、报刊上发表了纪念论文，并请有关国家的文化代表参加。就在前几天，五月二十四日，在我国首都刚刚举办了纪念捷克斯洛伐克大作曲家德沃夏克的大会，并演奏了他的作品。
    为了适应国际文化交流事业的需要，前些日子在我国首都北京宣告成立了“中国人民对外文化协会”，中国科学、文学、艺术界的许多著名人士，都是这个协会的理事，通过它，今后我国与世界各个国家的文化关系一定能够获得更大的发展。
    中国人民尊重并热爱自己祖国的文化传统，同时也以同样的尊重和热爱的心情，对待其他国家的文化传统以及作为全体人类所共享共有的各国人民的伟大祖先所创造的精神财富。中国人民抱着诚恳的态度和热烈的期望，愿与世界各国人民加强彼此之间的文化交流，中国人民向爱好和平的、尊重自己与别人的民族文化的朋友们伸出友谊的手，欢迎他们去看一看我国人民四年来在工业和农业方面的和平建设；看一看我们的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的民族戏剧和民间歌舞；看一看世界奇迹之一的万里长城；看一看千年前的奇伟的云岗石窟以及最近出土的三千多件（这是随同我国的大规模基本建设工程而来的）从商、周代直到明代的青铜器、陶器、瓷器、金饰、雕刻和其他珍贵的文物；看一看四时皆春的南国风光和明媚如画的西子湖。
    亲爱的朋友们：中国古代的哲人曾说过这样一句话：“己所不欲，勿施于人。”这句话的另一面的意义也就是尊重自己，同样也尊重别人。我们中国人民服膺这句话，我们尊重并珍视自己的民族文化，而正因为我们尊重并珍视自己的民族文化，所以我们认为一切其他国家的民族文化也必须受到尊重和珍视。在过去的一世纪中，中国人民在遭受到政治、经济的侵略之外，也遭受到文化的侵略，我们的古代文物受到掠夺和摧残，我们的儿童受着毒化。正因为我们有过这样的经验，所以我们坚决地拥护世界和平理事会的保卫民族文化的号召。我们认为保卫民族文化和文化交流不是对立的，而是相因相成的、互利互惠的。文化交流正可以使世界文化成为一个万花齐放、万年长春的文化公园。
    亲爱的朋友们：和平、友好、文化——这些美丽而庄严的事物——正如阳光和空气一样，是人类正常生活所不能缺少的要素，因而也是不能被拒绝、不能被封锁的。谁能拒绝千百年来各国劳动人民和先进的学者们的天才的创造和发明呢？谁能封锁住今天响遍了全世界的争取和平和保卫文化的呼声？人民的力量一直在创造着、保护着、传播交流并发展着辉煌的人类文化；同时也在坚决地打击着那些伸进文化果园来的丑恶的猪嘴，那些煽动战争的可耻叫嚣。在这一崇高事业中，新中国人民正在继承我们伟大祖先的精神，和各国人民一道作着不倦的努力。朋友们，让我们记住：世界和平理事会上一届维也纳会议关于文化交流的决议案的下列的几句话：“如果每一个珍视本国文化和世界文化的组织和个人，都决心建立联系，并为在互相交换的基础上建立有成果的国际交流而工作，那末前途是无限的。”
    让我们沿着全人类的伟大文化传统与人民友谊的道路前进吧！为使人类文化的阳光和空气能够温暖地普照着和沐浴着大地，在各国人民的心中长着不凋的、美丽的春天和光辉的希望，为使国际紧张局势得以进一步缓和，集体安全得以迅速实现，让我们大家加倍努力吧。
