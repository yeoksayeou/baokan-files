Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 12th: TASS reported from Jakarta on May 12th that Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo stated in a declaration issued on May 12th that the Indonesian government's foreign policy is based on the principle of an active and independent policy aimed at safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. He declared that Indonesia refuses to accept the "military alliance" plan of Southeast Asian countries proposed by the U.S. ruling clique.

Sunarjo fiercely attacked the "Netherlands-Indonesia Union," and pointed out that this union always reminded Indonesia of the colonial regime. He said, "Therefore, now is the time to abolish this union." It is known that this union was imposed on Indonesia by the colonial countries headed by the United States in 1949. He said that for the sake of security and the elimination of colonialism, Indonesia demands that the Netherlands immediately withdraw from West Irian.

    印尼外交部长发表声明
    拒绝接受美国组织东南亚军事联盟的计划
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社雅加达十二日讯：印尼外交部长苏纳约在五月十二日发表的声明中说，印尼政府在外交政策方面所根据的原则是一种以保障亚洲和世界和平为目的的积极、独立的政策。他宣称，印尼拒绝接受美国统治集团的关于建立东南亚国家的“军事联盟”的计划。
    苏纳约激烈地抨击“荷印（尼）联邦”，并指出这个联邦老是使印尼想起殖民政权。他说，“因此，现在已是废除这个联邦的时候了。”大家知道，这个联邦是以美国为首的殖民国家在一九四九年强加在印尼身上的。他说，为了安全和废除殖民主义，印尼要求荷兰立刻退出西伊里安。
