    Introduction to Local Fertilizer Source Development Experiences in Various Regions
    Liu Ziqi
    Currently, there are many problems in fertilizer supply work. On the one hand, due to the increased production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers, the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland has increased year by year, especially the demand for commercial fertilizers (chemical fertilizers, cake fertilizers) has increased even more; on the other hand, China's current production of commercial fertilizers is still greatly limited, and relying solely on the supply of commercial fertilizers is far from meeting the needs of farmers. Under such circumstances, in addition to controlling and focusing the supply of commercial fertilizers to grain and cotton producing areas, the more important thing is to vigorously implement the policy of "mainly relying on farm natural fertilizers and supplementing with commercial fertilizers," and fully tap local fertilizer sources to make up for the shortage of commercial fertilizers. Now, I will introduce the methods of regions with better development of local fertilizer sources for reference.
    I. Organize the transportation of urban manure and garbage to the countryside. The methods adopted by supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province this year to organize the transportation of urban manure and garbage to the countryside are: (1) contact relevant departments such as urban sanitation to contract all the manure from public toilets and factories, institutions, schools, and organizations; (2) convene small-scale symposiums through residents' committees to mobilize the masses to sell manure to the cooperatives; (3) adopt the method of guaranteed purchase for small vendors in cities who manage manure. As for urban garbage, the supply and marketing cooperatives organize farmers to purchase it themselves. Through the above methods, about 90 million catties of manure and more than 10,000 tons of garbage are organized to be transported from cities such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Wujin, and Changzhou every month, which not only meets the needs of farmers but is also welcomed by the masses of farmers due to the cheap price.
    II. Go deep into factories and workshops to collect "scraps" and "waste products" and other miscellaneous items to replace fertilizers. The Tianjin Municipal Cooperative Headquarters first collected various industrial waste products and miscellaneous items, tested them, and listed various items, output, prices, and nitrogen content that can be used for fertilizing, and sent them to relevant units for reference. The Municipal Finance and Economic Committee and the Industrial and Commercial Administration Department separately instructed various state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private factories and enterprises, and private industries to hand over all kinds of waste materials containing nitrogen that can be used as fertilizer produced by them, such as wool soil, wheat soil, cottonseed soil, cottonseed skins, various grain husks and bran residues, etc., more than one hundred kinds in total, to the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters for unified purchase, and organized to supply farmers as fertilizer. From January to mid-March this year, the cooperative system of the city has already purchased and ordered more than 10 million catties of waste products that can be used as fertilizer, equivalent to about 3 million catties of soybean cake.
    III. Organize and purchase miscellaneous fertilizers such as pig and cattle bones, fish scales, shrimp bran, and shell ash. From November last year to mid-March this year, the county and district supply and marketing cooperatives of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, purchased 4,357 dan of pig and cattle bones (3,961 dan of bone meal have now been made), 28,540 dan of oyster shell ash, 6,720 dan of white clams (small river insects), 20,160 dan of tea bran, 266 dan of fish scales and shrimp bran, 1,900 dan of tobacco bones and tobacco leaves, and more than 10,000 dan of other miscellaneous fertilizers such as pig hair, pig offal, rice straw ash, fermented soybean dregs, peanut bran, sesame bran, and miscellaneous cakes, totaling nineteen kinds of local miscellaneous fertilizers, more than 170,000 dan, which can replace more than 67,000 dan of oil cake, basically solving the problem of insufficient commercial fertilizer during spring plowing in the county, and the farmers responded well.
    IV. Use various methods to strengthen the purchase of local miscellaneous cake raw materials. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province have adopted the following three methods in organizing local fertilizer sources: (1) Carry out storage and advance ordering to achieve the "three combinations" of paying money for oil materials stored by farmers, giving cake for cake, and giving oil for oil; (2) Sign combination contracts with agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid groups to exchange cake for materials. For example, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Echeng County, Hubei Province, have signed a total of 71 combination contracts with mutual aid groups and purchased 1.84 million catties of oil materials; (3) Sign agency purchase contracts with ginneries. For example, the Fengkou District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Zhijiang County, Hubei Province, signed agency purchase contracts with 12 ginneries, and received 640,000 catties of cottonseeds in less than two months.
    V. Help farmers expand the planting area of green manure. Planting grass seeds and turning over green manure reduces the difficulty of delivering manure, saves labor and time, and is very suitable for farmers' economic conditions. This year, Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized farmers to plant a total of 320,000 mu of green manure (Jianghua grass), which is equivalent to 100 catties of soybean cake per mu, totaling 32 million catties of cake fertilizer effect.
    VI. Mobilize farmers to raise pigs for manure accumulation, and use oil cake and powder residue to feed pigs to produce manure. According to a survey of 450 farmer households in Sunzhuang, Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, a total of 450 fattened pigs and 1,350 piglets were raised last year; this year, the number of fattened pigs increased to 674, and the number of piglets to 1,800. Their method of raising pigs is to mix oil cake with weeds, wild vegetables, melons and vegetables to feed pigs, changing the past habit of directly applying oil cake to the land, and ensuring that there are pigs and pens. This practice not only solves the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer and feed but also produces a large amount of meat to supply the needs of the people.
    VII. Mobilize farmers to accumulate fertilizer and dig up soil fertilizer. The work group of Hengshan Township, Guilong Seventh District, Guangxi Province, held a meeting of mutual aid group leaders to study and exchange experience in accumulating fertilizer, and found several fertilizer sources: (1) using turf to burn ash and composting miscellaneous items and blue silk grass in the river can obtain a large amount of fertilizer; (2) digging ditch, river, and pond mud; (3) digging manure pit soil, cattle pen soil, and ash house soil as fertilizer; (4) using rural garbage and miscellaneous items; (5) burning small kiln lime. After this mass mobilization to accumulate fertilizer, Hengshan Township accumulated more than 10,570 dan of various miscellaneous fertilizers in three days.
    VIII. Organize lime production to neutralize farmland soil. For example, there are more than 200 private lime kilns in Liling County, Hunan Province, of which 153 were preparing not to burn due to insufficient funds. After learning about this situation, the local supply and marketing cooperative immediately held a symposium for lime kiln owners, explaining the importance of lime production and fertilizer, and further mobilized mutual aid groups to pre-purchase from kiln factories, which not only solved the financial difficulties of kiln factories but also met the needs of farmers to use lime as fertilizer.
    It can be seen from the above situation that as long as the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels attach importance to the organization of local miscellaneous fertilizers, it can, to a certain extent, make up for the current shortage of commercial fertilizers in our country. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should combine with the actual local conditions, learn and promote the above experience, and strive to organize more fertilizer supply to farmers and ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production increase plan.

    各地开辟地方肥源的经验介绍
    刘子奇
    在目前肥料供应工作中，存在不少问题。一方面由于广大农民生产积极性的提高，农民对农田的施肥量逐年增多，特别对商品肥料（化学肥料、饼肥）的需要量增加更多；另一方面，我国目前商品肥料的生产还有极大限制，仅仅依靠商品肥料的供应远远不能满足农民的需要。在这种情况下，除有控制地、有重点地把商品肥料供应给粮棉产区外，更重要的是应该大力贯彻“以农家自然肥料为主，以商品肥料为辅”的方针，充分挖掘地方肥源，以弥补商品肥料的不足。现在特把开辟地方肥源较好地区的办法介绍出来，以供各地参考。
    一、组织城市大粪、垃圾下乡。江苏省各地供销合作社今年组织城市大粪、垃圾下乡的方法是：（1）与城市卫生等有关部门联系，把公共厕所及工厂、机关、学校、团体的大粪全部包下来；（2）通过居民委员会召开小型座谈会，动员群众将大粪卖给合作社；（3）对城市经营大粪的小商贩采取了包购的办法。至于对城市的垃圾则由供销合作社组织农民自己采购。通过上述办法，从上海、苏州、南京、无锡、武进、常州等城市每月组织下乡的大粪约九千余万斤，垃圾一万多吨，不仅供应了农民的需要，并且因为价格便宜，很受农民群众欢迎。
    二、深入工厂作坊搜集“下脚”“废品”等杂物代替肥料。天津市合作总社事先搜集了各种工业废品和杂物，经过化验，将能用于肥田的各种品名、产量、价格、含氮率等列表送各有关单位参考，并由市财政经济委员会与工商行政部门分别指示各国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂企业和私营行业，要求将其所产含有氮素的各种可利用作肥料的废料，如毛土、麦子土、棉籽土、棉籽皮、各种粮糠及皮子渣等一百多种，全部交由市合作总社统一收购，组织下乡供应农民作肥料。该市合作社系统从今年一月至三月中旬，已经现购和订购可以利用作肥料的废品，计有一千多万斤，约顶豆饼三百万斤。
    三、组织与收购猪牛骨、鱼鳞、虾糠、壳灰等杂肥。广东省新会县县、区供销合作社从去年十一月开始到今年三月中旬止，分别在广州、江门、会城等城市收购了猪、牛骨四千三百五十七担（现已制成骨粉三千九百六十一担），蚝壳灰二万八千五百四十担，白蚬仔（河内小虫）六千七百二十担，茶麸二万零一百六十多担，鱼鳞及虾糠二百六十六担，烟骨、烟叶一千九百多担，其他猪毛、猪杂、禾草灰、豆豉渣、花生麸、芝麻麸、杂饼等杂肥一万多担，总共收购了土杂肥十九种，十七万多担，能代替六万七千多担油饼，基本上解决了该县春耕期间商品肥料不足的困难，农民反映良好。
    四、用各种方法加强地方杂饼原料的收购。湖北省各地供销合作社在组织当地肥源中采取了以下三种办法：（1）开展存实预订，做到农民存油料后要钱给钱、要饼给饼、要油给油的“三结合”；
  （2）与农业生产合作社或互助组签订结合合同，以饼换料，如湖北省鄂城县各地供销合作社总共与七十一个互助组订立了结合合同，收购了一百八十四万斤油料；（3）与轧花户订立代购合同。如湖北省枝江县冯口区供销合作社与十二家轧花户订立了代购合同，不到两个月就收到棉籽六十四万斤。
    五、帮助农民扩大绿肥种植面积。种草籽翻绿肥，减少送粪困难，既省人力又省时间，很符合农民经济条件。江苏奉贤县今年动员农民种植绿肥（江花草）共三十二万亩，以每亩折合一百斤豆饼计算，共顶三千二百万斤饼肥效用。
    六、动员农民养猪积肥，利用油饼、粉渣喂猪造粪。据河北涿县孙庄四百五十户农民调查，去年共养肥猪四百五十只，小猪一千三百五十只；今年养肥猪增到六百七十四只，小猪一千八百只。他们养猪的方法，系用油饼掺杂野草、野菜、瓜菜喂猪，改变了过去用油饼直接上地的习惯，并做到有猪有圈。这种作法，不但解决了肥料和饲料不足的困难，还可生产大量食肉供应人民的需要。
    七、动员农民积肥和挖掘土肥。广西省桂临七区横山乡工作组召开互助组长会议研究和交流积肥的经验，发现几种肥源：（1）利用草皮烧灰和杂物、河里蓝丝草堆肥，可获得大宗肥料；（2）挖沟、河、塘泥；（3）挖粪坑土、牛栏土、灰房土作肥料；（4）利用农村的垃圾杂物；（5）烧小窑石灰。经过这次发动群众大量积肥后，在三天内，横山全乡就已积起各种杂肥一万零五百七十多担。
    八、组织石灰生产，中和农田土壤。如湖南醴陵县共有二百多个私人石灰窑，其中有一百五十三个因资金不足，准备不烧，当地供销合作社了解这一情况后，即召开石灰窑主座谈会，说明石灰生产与肥料的重要性，并进一步动员互助组向窑厂预购，这不仅解决了窑厂资金的困难，也满足了农民以石灰作肥料的要求。
    从上述情况可以看出，只要各级供销合作社重视地方杂肥的组织工作，是可以在一定程度上弥补目前我国商品肥料不足的缺陷的。各级供销合作社应结合当地实际情况，学习和推广上述经验，为争取组织更多的肥料供应给农民、保证完成今年的农业增产计划而努力。
