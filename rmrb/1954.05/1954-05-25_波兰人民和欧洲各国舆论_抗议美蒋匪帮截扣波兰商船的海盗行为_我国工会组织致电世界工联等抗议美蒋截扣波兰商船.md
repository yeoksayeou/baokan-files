Xinhua News Agency dispatch: People in various parts of Poland continue to protest the illegal interception of Polish merchant ships again by the Chiang Kai-shek gang, which is sheltered and assisted by the United States. Fourteen factories in Krakow held protest rallies on the 18th. Various departments of the Lenin Metallurgical Combine held protest rallies on the 21st. Those present pointed out indignantly that the United States, by instigating the Chiang Kai-shek gang to create this provocative incident, aimed to intensify international tensions. They firmly demanded the immediate return of the hijacked merchant ships "Praca" and "Gottwald." In Silesia, workers in various industries expressed their indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek gang's interception of Polish merchant ships. The workers of the "Gottwald" mine, who had friendly contact with the people on the "Gottwald" merchant ship, also held a protest rally. They strongly demanded the immediate return of the Polish merchant ships and their personnel.

Polish sailors sailing on the high seas were very angry after hearing about the piratical act of the Chiang Kai-shek gang intercepting Polish merchant ships again. Personnel from twenty fishing boats sailing in the northern seas held protest rallies and passed resolutions demanding the return of the ships and crew.

The Polish Seamen's Trade Union also cabled the International Transport, Port and Fishery Workers' Trade Union, protesting the piratical act of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, under the instigation of the United States, in illegally intercepting Polish merchant ships.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Newspapers in various European countries have published news and commentaries about the Chiang Kai-shek gang, under the shelter of the United States, illegally intercepting Polish merchant ships again.

Soviet newspapers prominently published the Polish government's note of protest to the U.S. government. The newspapers emphasized that the piratical attacks on the high seas and the hijacking of Polish ships grossly violated the freedom of navigation and the principles of international law. The United States not only instigated this attack, but its armed forces also actively participated in it.

The Berlin "Daily Review" pointed out: This attack is a political provocation aimed at undermining efforts to ease international tensions.

Newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania all published news about the American puppet in Taiwan hijacking Polish merchant ships once again.

In Britain, the "Daily Worker" pointed out: The responsibility for this act of aggression should be borne by those who use the bankrupt Kuomintang gang to prevent peaceful navigation and worsen the situation in the Far East. The "Manchester Guardian" and "Daily Telegraph" published summaries of the Polish note. The "Daily Telegraph" emphasized that a U.S. aircraft tracked and reconnoitered the "Gottwald" before Chiang Kai-shek's warships attacked the "Gottwald." This shows that the U.S. armed forces actively participated in this attack.

The Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung," "Solidarity," "Workers' Voice," and other newspapers also published news about the hijacking of the "Gottwald" and the Polish government's note of protest.

[Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions cabled Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, protesting the piratical act of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, under the instigation of the United States, in intercepting Polish merchant ships twice. The text of the cable is as follows: Comrade Louis Saillant of the World Federation of Trade Unions:

Under the instigation of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan has twice intercepted Polish merchant ships on the high seas, on October 4th of last year and May 13th of this year. This piratical act of repeatedly violating the norms of international law has aroused extreme indignation among the entire Chinese people. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country resolutely oppose the piratical acts of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and firmly support the struggle of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions demanding the immediate release of the detained Polish merchant ships and their personnel.

At a time when the Geneva Conference is being held, and people all over the world are eager to further ease tensions in Asia and the world, and many countries are concerned about improving and expanding trade relations with China, the United States has instigated the Chiang Kai-shek gang to repeatedly intercept Polish merchant ships, carrying out provocations, obviously attempting to deepen tensions in the Far East and thereby maintain its bankrupt "embargo" policy.

All countries and people who hope to ease tensions in Asia and the world and hope to improve trade relations between countries should rise up to condemn the United States' serious violation of international law and demand that the U.S. government instruct the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan to immediately release the intercepted Polish merchant ships, personnel, and materials, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. We request the World Federation of Trade Unions to take the necessary measures to strive for the release of the detained Polish merchant ships and their personnel. All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　May 21, 1954

Also, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Trade Union cabled Fresinay, Secretary-General of the International Transport, Port and Fishery Workers' Trade Union, protesting the piratical act of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, under the instigation of the United States, in intercepting Polish merchant ships twice.

    我国工会组织致电世界工联等抗议美蒋截扣波兰商船
    据新华社讯：波兰各地人民继续抗议美国庇护并帮助蒋介石匪帮再次非法截扣波兰商船。克拉科夫有十四个工厂在十八日举行了抗议大会。列宁冶金联合企业的各个部门在二十一日都举行了抗议大会。到会的人愤慨地指出：美国指使蒋介石匪帮制造这一挑衅事件的目的是为了加剧国际紧张局势。他们坚决要求立即归还被劫走的“布拉卡”号和“哥特瓦尔德”号商船。在西里西亚，各业工人对蒋介石匪帮截扣波兰商船的行为表示愤慨。和“哥特瓦尔德”号商船的人曾有着友好接触的“哥特瓦尔德”矿场的工人们，也举行了抗议集会。他们强烈要求立即归还波兰商船及其人员。
    正在公海上航行的波兰海员们在听到蒋介石匪帮再次截扣波兰商船的海盗行为后，感到十分愤怒。航行在北部海洋的二十只渔船的人员举行了抗议集会，并通过了要求归还船只和船员的决议。
    波兰航运工人工会也致电运输、港口与渔业工人工会国际，抗议蒋介石匪帮在美国指使下非法截扣波兰商船的海盗行为。
    据新华社讯：欧洲各国报纸纷纷刊载蒋介石匪帮在美国庇护下再次非法截扣波兰商船的消息，并发表评论。
    苏联报纸以显著地位刊载了波兰政府致美国政府的抗议照会。各报强调指出，在公海上进行海盗式的袭击和劫走波兰船只的行为，粗暴地破坏了航海自由和国际法原则。美国不仅策动了这次袭击，并且它的武装部队还积极参加了这次袭击。
    柏林“每日评论报”指出：这种袭击是一种政治挑衅，它的目的在于破坏为缓和国际紧张局势所进行的努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚的报纸都刊载了关于美国的台湾傀儡又一次劫走波兰商船的消息。
    在英国，“工人日报”指出：这种侵略行动的责任，应该由那些利用破产了的国民党匪帮来阻止和平航行和使远东局势恶化的人承担。“曼彻斯特卫报”和“每日电讯报”刊载了波兰照会的摘要。“每日电讯报”强调指出：在蒋介石军舰没有向
  “哥特瓦尔德”号进行袭击以前，曾有一架美国飞机跟踪侦察“哥特瓦尔德”号。这说明美国武装部队积极参加了这次袭击。
    瑞士“新苏黎世报”、“团结报”、“工人之声报”和其他报纸也刊载了关于“哥特瓦尔德”号被劫的消息和波兰政府的抗议照会。
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国总工会致电世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，抗议蒋介石匪帮在美国指使下两次截扣波兰商船的海盗行为。电文如下：世界工会联合会路易·赛扬同志：
    台湾蒋介石匪帮在美国指使下，于去年十月四日和今年五月十三日先后在公海上两次截扣波兰商船，这种一再破坏国际法准则的海盗行为，激起了全中国人民的极端愤慨。中国工人阶级和全国人民坚决反对美国和蒋匪帮的海盗行为，并坚决支持波兰工会中央理事会要求立即释放被扣的波兰商船及其人员的斗争。
    正当日内瓦会议期间，全世界人民都渴望进一步缓和亚洲及世界紧张局势，许多国家都关心着改善和扩展对中国的贸易关系。而美国却指使蒋匪帮一再截扣波兰商船，进行挑衅，显然是企图加深远东的紧张局势，并借此维持其已破产的“禁运”政策。
    一切希望缓和亚洲和世界紧张局势、希望改善各国间的贸易关系的国家和人民，应该起来谴责美国严重违犯国际法准则的行为，要求美国政府指令台湾蒋匪帮立即释放所截扣的波兰商船、人员和物资，并保证不再发生类似事件。我们请求世界工会联合会为争取释放被扣波兰商船及其人员采取必要的措施。中华全国总工会
                  一九五四年五月二十一日
    又讯：中国海员工会筹备委员会也致电运输、港口与渔业工人工会国际总书记弗雷西奈，抗议蒋介石匪帮在美国指使下两次截扣波兰商船的海盗行为。
