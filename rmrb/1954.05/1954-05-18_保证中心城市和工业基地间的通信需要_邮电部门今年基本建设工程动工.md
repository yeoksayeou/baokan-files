Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: China's postal and telecommunications construction will continue to develop accordingly. This year, the postal and telecommunications capital construction will primarily ensure communication needs between political and economic central cities and industrial bases, while also focusing on addressing local communication requirements. Of the postal and telecommunications capital construction projects planned for this year, 190 have already commenced, with active preparations underway for the remaining projects, which will be initiated successively.

	In terms of long-distance telecommunications, there are 37 major new and expanded line projects this year. The new lines, calculated as double lines, will be over 11,000 kilometers long. Major lines from Beijing to Wuhan, Shenyang, Chengde, Tianjin to Shanghai, Wuhan to Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Zhengzhou to Xi'an will be strengthened; some will also be equipped with new multi-channel carrier equipment, enabling multiple channels of communication on a single pair of lines simultaneously. In Yan'an, Suide, Yulin, Boshan, Liaocheng, Fancheng, and many other places where communication needs are relatively urgent, lines will also be added or carrier equipment installed. The number of multi-channel carrier equipment planned to be newly installed nationwide this year will be 6% of the existing equipment, and single-channel carrier equipment will be 7%. Single-channel carrier equipment can add one communication channel to a pair of copper wires.

	To strengthen communication between the interior and remote provinces, various types of radio stations will also be newly built and expanded this year. Important cities such as Urumqi, Xichang, Altay, Hotan, Shache, Aksu, Ya'an, Kangding, and Garzê all have medium-sized radio station expansion and construction projects underway, to gradually form communication networks in various remote areas. In addition, the number of newly built small radio stations will increase by 16% compared to those newly built in 1953.

	This year, the new urban telephone exchange equipment installed in cities across the country will be 32% more than the number newly installed last year, of which 60% will be automatic telephones. Beijing, Shenyang, Chongqing, Tianjin, and other places will all have automatic telephone construction this year. By the end of this year, the number of newly built automatic telephones in Beijing will be 50% of the original equipment. Urumqi, Shijiazhuang, Hohhot, and other cities will also begin building new urban telephone systems this year. This year, survey and design work will also be carried out for the construction of automatic telephone systems in some large and emerging industrial cities.

	This year, the total length of postal routes will increase by 4% compared to last year, with railway postal routes increasing by 3.8%, self-operated motor vehicle postal routes increasing by 24%, and air postal routes increasing by 7.4%.

    保证中心城市和工业基地间的通信需要
    邮电部门今年基本建设工程动工
    【新华社十七日讯】我国邮电建设事业将继续得到相应的发展。今年邮电基本建设主要是保证政治经济中心城市和工业基地相互间的通信需要，并重点地解决地方上的通信要求。今年计划中的邮电基本建设工程已有一百九十项先后开工，其余项目正积极准备，将陆续开工。
    在长途电信方面，今年新建和扩建的主要线路工程有三十七项，新建线路以双线计算长一万一千多公里。北京到武汉、沈阳、承德，天津到上海，武汉到广州、重庆，郑州到西安等干线都将加强；有的还要加装新式的多路载波机，使一对线路同时可以多路通信。在延安、绥德、榆林、博山、聊城、樊城以及其他许多通信需要比较迫切的地方，也都要增建线路或加装载波机。今年全国计划新装的多路载波机为原有设备的百分之六，单路载波机为百分之七。单路载波机可以使一对铜线增加一路通信。
    为了加强内地和边远各省区的通信，今年还要新建和扩建各种类型的无线电台，如乌鲁木齐、西昌、阿勒泰、和阗、莎车、阿克苏、雅安、康定、甘孜等重要城市都有扩建和新建中型电台的工程，以逐步构成各边远地区的通信网。此外，新建的小型无线电台要比一九五三年新建的数目增加百分之十六。
    今年在全国各城市新装的市内电话交换机设备，要比去年新装数多百分之三十二，其中有百分之六十是自动电话。北京、沈阳、重庆、天津等地，今年都有自动电话的建设。北京到今年年底止，新建自动电话的数量将为原设备的百分之五十。乌鲁木齐、石家庄、呼和浩特等城市，今年也要开始新建市内电话。今年还将为某些大城市和新兴工业城市的自动电话建设作好勘查设计工作。
    今年邮路的总长度将比去年增加百分之四，其中铁路邮路增加百分之三点八，自办汽车邮路增加百分之二十四，航空邮路增加百分之七点四。
