    Guangzhou City's workers in many state-owned and local state-owned factories are actively learning and striving to improve their technical theoretical knowledge and technical level.
    The sand casting technology lecture series, jointly organized by the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, the preparatory committee of the Guangdong Science and Technology Popularization Association, and the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace, began in mid-March this year.  Workers from factories such as the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory and the joint state-private Xiehe Machinery Factory, as well as workers from many small machinery factories in various districts of the city, participated in the technology lecture series. Teachers Zeng Wenzhong from South China Institute of Technology and Huang Jinfu, the director of the institute's internship factory, were responsible for lecturing. The participating workers gained a lot after listening to the teachers' accessible lectures. In the past, the workers in the iron casting workshop of the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory found that the quality of the cast iron flywheels for stone crushers was loose and not strong. After learning, they were able to analyze the reasons. Xia Yongxiang, a furnace worker from the private Dasheng Foundry in the Central District of Guangzhou, returned to the factory after listening to the lecture on the "Cupola Operation Method" and repaired the furnace according to the method taught by the teacher and improved the operating techniques. The quality of the iron melted has improved and the time has been shortened. In the past, only ten dans of iron were melted per hour, but now seventeen dans can be melted.
    The state-owned Guangzhou Xicun Cement Factory held a mechanical technology training class in September last year. Most of the forty participants were workers with a junior high school education or above. The results of the first examination held at the beginning of this year were generally very good. This year, the factory also held a cement industry training class and an advanced experience training class, with more than 200 managers and technicians with a junior high school education or above participating. The advanced experience training class played a major role in the factory's recent promotion of the Soviet advanced experience "fast rotary kiln method" and "shell water cooling method."
    The local state-owned Guangzhou Water Company also started a water distribution network technology training class in February this year. Veteran technician Liang Guokai, who is over seventy years old, and veteran worker Li Lin and others actively participated in the study. In the past, Li Lin could not understand the water pipe distribution map. After learning, he not only could read the map, but also learned to draw the map. During practice, he drew a water pipe layout map for the pipe installation project he was responsible for.

    广州市的工人努力学习技术
    广州市不少国营、地方国营工厂工人积极学习，努力提高技术理论知识与技术水平。
    广州市工会联合会与广东科学技术普及协会筹备会、岭南文物宫等单位联合举办的翻砂技术讲座，于今年三月中旬开课。参加技术讲座学习的有国营广州通用机器厂及公私合营协同和机器厂等工厂的翻砂工人，尚有全市各区许多小机器厂的工人。由华南工学院教师曾文中及该学院实习工厂厂长黄进福负责讲授。参加学习的工人们听过教师的通俗讲授后，收获很大。广州通用机器厂铸铁车间工人过去铸造轧石机的飞轮铁质很松，不坚实，经过学习后，已能分析出原因。广州市中区私营大生铸造厂炉工夏永祥听过“冲天炉操作法”的讲授后，回到工厂就按照教师讲的方法，把熔炉修补好，并改进了操作技术，熔出的铁的质量已有提高，时间也缩短了，过去一小时只熔十担铁，现在可熔十七担。
    国营广州西村水泥厂于去年九月间举办了机械技术学习班，参加学习的四十人，绝大部分为具有初中以上文化程度的工人。今年初举行第一次考试的结果，一般成绩都很好。该厂今年还举办了水泥工业学习班及先进经验学习班，参加学习者为具有初中以上文化程度的管理人员及技术人员共二百多人。先进经验学习班对于该厂最近推行苏联先进经验“快速转窑法”及“胴体水冷却法”起了很大的作用。
    地方国营广州市自来水公司自今年二月份起也举办了配水网技术学习班。七十多岁的老技师梁国开及老工人李林等积极参加学习。李林过去看不懂水管分布图，学习后不仅能看图，并且已学会绘图；在练习时，他绘了一张自己负责施工的装管工程的水管布置图。
