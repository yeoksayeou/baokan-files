    Jiangsu Provincial Food Company
    Actively Purchases Fresh Eggs
    The Jiangsu Provincial Company of the China Food Company actively purchases fresh eggs. The company signed a contract with the provincial cooperative to purchase eggs on its behalf. There are nearly five hundred cooperatives throughout the province acting as purchasing agents. The amount purchased has increased two and a half times compared to last year. The company also regularly sends cadres to grassroots cooperatives to provide technical guidance, helping to improve business levels and increase the qualification rate for exports. The purchasing task for the first quarter has already been overfulfilled. This has not only provided farmers with an income of nearly 30 billion yuan, but also supported the egg product processing industry in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, and supplied the needs of people in this province as well as in Beijing, Shenyang, Fushun, and other cities for egg products. Currently, the company is continuing to purchase in order to meet the needs of people's consumption and export.

    江苏省食品公司
    积极收购鲜鸡蛋
    中国食品公司江苏省公司，积极收购鲜鸡蛋。该公司和省合作社签订了代购鸡蛋合同，全省现有近五百个合作社代为收购。收购的数量比去年增加了两倍半。该公司还经常派干部到基层社进行技术指导，帮助提高业务水平，增加出口的合格率。现第一季度的收购任务已超额完成。这不但使农民获得了近三百亿元的收入，而且支援了上海、天津等地的蛋制品加工业，供应了本省以及北京、沈阳、抚顺等城市人民蛋品的需要。目前，该公司正继续进行收购，以满足人民消费和出口的需要。
