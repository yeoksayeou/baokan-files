Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 5th (by our special correspondent Shen Jiantu) – On the afternoon of the 4th, the Geneva Conference continued its sixth day of general discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. Meanwhile, with the arrival of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, preparations for discussing the Indochina issue also began.

After Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a positive proposal advocating the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces and the holding of free all-Korean elections without any foreign pressure, the US delegation has still not put forward any constructive proposals.

Since the opening of the Geneva Conference, Britain and France have maintained a cautious silence regarding Dulles's speeches. Even Dulles's Western "allies" feel it is inconvenient to publicly support him, which shows how unpopular his demands on the Korean issue are. Therefore, Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister was ordered to engage in despicable activities. Even some American journalists consider Byun Yung-tai's long-winded rant on the 3rd to be "nonsense," and they consider Byun Yung-tai a "laughing stock." European observers believe that it is regrettable that the Geneva Conference, where the world's hope lies, is being used by Byun Yung-tai for "destructive work."

Before leaving Geneva, Dulles issued a statement to reporters. The statement made no mention of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, which is an indispensable step for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. During the Korean armistice negotiations, the US side refused to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops, arguing at the time that this was a "political issue." Since the Geneva Conference is discussing this "political issue," Dulles had to publicly express his opposition to the withdrawal of foreign troops. It is very clear at the Geneva Conference that Dulles's real reason for opposing the withdrawal of foreign troops is that Washington is implementing a policy of allowing US troops to remain in Korea indefinitely. Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister was eager to defend this US policy, even saying at the meeting on the 3rd that the United States had interfered too little in Korea and hoped for more. Because, as Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out, the Syngman Rhee regime cannot exist without American bayonets.

Dulles's demand to hold elections only in North Korea under the supervision of the United Nations is so unreasonable that even Australian Foreign Minister Casey had to consider the reaction of public opinion and had to say that elections should be held in both North and South Korea.

To all those who have paid attention to the development of the Korean War, it is very clear that Dulles's re-proposal at the Geneva Conference of the demand for UN supervision of Korean elections is a demand to obtain what the sixteen-nation army, fighting under the banner of the United Nations, failed to obtain in Korea for three years. During the Korean armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese delegation, headed by Nam Il, refused the US demand to ban the construction of airfields, because this was interference in internal affairs. The United States had to abandon this demand due to public pressure and heavy casualties on the battlefield. Now Dulles is using the guise of "UN supervision of Korean elections" to demand interference in Korea's internal affairs at the Geneva Conference.

Before leaving Geneva, Dulles raised the issue of the "principle of proportionally elected representatives," attempting to obstruct the establishment of an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea to preside over free elections. As Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out in his speech, this issue will not arise because the composition of the committee will be bilateral in nature, and the committee's decisions must be passed through mutual agreement.

The US side said that the withdrawal of US troops from Korea might cause the war to restart. This excuse has been refuted by the third clause of Nam Il's proposal. However, US spokespersons and newspapers have so far been trying to prevent the public from knowing about this proposal of Nam Il. Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal is that, in order to guarantee peace in Korea, the corresponding countries that have the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East should assume the obligation of not interfering in Korea's internal affairs and guaranteeing Korea's peaceful development.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said that the People's Republic of China fully agrees with this proposal and is willing to work with other relevant countries to guarantee the fulfillment of this obligation. The question now is: Is the United States equally sincere in fulfilling this obligation?

### 新华社记者评日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题  指出美国反对撤离外国军队旨在使美军长驻朝鲜进行干涉

    新华社记者评日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
    指出美国反对撤离外国军队旨在使美军长驻朝鲜进行干涉
    【新华社日内瓦五日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：四日下午，日内瓦会议继续进行关于和平解决朝鲜问题的第六天的一般性讨论，同时，随着越南民主共和国代表团的到达，讨论印度支那问题的准备工作也开始了。
    在南日外务相提出积极的建议，主张撤退一切外国武装部队、举行不受任何外国压力的全朝鲜自由选举以后，美国代表团仍然一直没有提出建设性的建议来。
    自从日内瓦会议开幕以来，英国和法国到现在为止，一直对杜勒斯的发言保持谨慎的沉默。连杜勒斯的西方“盟友”都认为不便公开出面支持他，由此可见他在朝鲜问题上的要求之不得人心了。因此，李承晚的外务部长官奉命从事卑鄙的勾当，甚至连某些美国记者都认为卞荣泰三日发表的长篇谩骂是“废话”，他们认为卞荣泰是“笑柄”。欧洲观察家认为，世界希望所在的日内瓦会议竟然被卞荣泰用来进行“破坏性的工作”，这是一件令人遗憾的事情。
    杜勒斯在离开日内瓦前向记者发表了一篇声明。声明中丝毫也没有提到外国军队撤离朝鲜，而这正是和平解决朝鲜问题的必不可少的步骤。在朝鲜停战谈判中，美方代表曾经拒绝讨论外国军队撤退的问题，他们当时所持的理由是，这是一个“政治问题”。由于日内瓦会议正在讨论这个“政治问题”，杜勒斯只好公开表示反对外国军队撤退了。在日内瓦会议上看得十分清楚，杜勒斯反对外国军队撤退的真正原因，是华盛顿执行着使美国军队无限期留驻朝鲜的政策。李承晚的外务部长官急于要为美国的这种政策辩护，在三日的会议上居然说美国对朝鲜的干涉太少，希望更多一些。因为，正如南日外务相所指出的，没有美国的刺刀，李承晚政权就不能存在。
    杜勒斯要求在联合国的监督下只在北朝鲜举行选举，这个要求之不合理到了这样的地步，以致连澳大利亚外长凯西也不能不顾及舆论的反应，他不得不说，选举应该在朝鲜南北两部分举行。
    在所有曾经注意朝鲜战争发展情况的人们看来，十分清楚，杜勒斯在日内瓦会议上重新提出联合国监督朝鲜选举的要求，就是要求得到十六国军队打着联合国的旗帜在朝鲜打了三年仗都未能得到的东西。在朝鲜进行停战谈判期间，以南日为首的朝中代表团曾经拒绝美国所提出的禁止建筑机场的要求，因为这是对于内政的干涉。美国由于受到公众的压力和在战场上遭受了重大伤亡，才不得不放弃这种要求。现在杜勒斯又打着“联合国监督朝鲜选举”的幌子在日内瓦会议上要求干涉朝鲜的内政了。
    杜勒斯在离开日内瓦以前，提出了“按比例选出代表的原则”的问题，企图借此来阻挠由北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表组成的、主持自由选举的全朝鲜委员会的成立。诚如南日外务相在发言中指出的，这个问题是不会发生的，因为委员会的组成将为双边的性质，委员会的决定要经过双方的协议才能通过。
    美国方面说，美国军队撤出朝鲜可能引起战争再起。这种借口已被南日建议的第三款驳倒了。而美国的发言人和报纸到目前为止，一直企图不让公众知道南日的这项建议。南日外务相的这项建议是，为了保证朝鲜的和平，对维护远东和平具有最大关心的相应国家应负起不干涉朝鲜的内政以及保证朝鲜的和平发展的义务。
    周恩来外长说，中华人民共和国完全赞成这个建议，并愿意同其他有关各国一道来保证这一义务的履行。目前的问题是：美国是否也同样有诚意来履行这一义务呢？
