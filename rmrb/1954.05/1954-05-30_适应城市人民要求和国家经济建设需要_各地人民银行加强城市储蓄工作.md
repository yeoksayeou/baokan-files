To meet the requirements of urban residents and the needs of national economic construction, People's Banks in various regions are strengthening urban savings work.

[This News Report] In recent years, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, urban savings deposits have gradually increased in various regions. As of early May this year, the total urban savings deposits nationwide were approximately ten times that of the end of 1950. After the publicity campaign on the general task of the state's transition period was launched last year, the broad masses of workers and urban residents deeply recognized the significance of saving and thrift for supporting national economic construction. Moreover, over the past few years, many people have experienced the benefits of saving in their actual lives, so they are even more eager to participate in saving. Many workers have written letters requesting banks to strengthen savings work; the People's Representatives Conferences in Changchun and other cities have also passed resolutions requesting banks to expand urban savings business. As of early May this year, the amount of money deposited in banks by urban people nationwide increased by 41.9 percent compared with the same period last year; the Northwest region increased by 1.4 times.

The Head Office of the People's Bank of China convened a symposium on urban savings work from the end of March to the beginning of April, and decided to further develop urban savings work in order to meet the new demands of urban people for saving and to accumulate funds for national socialist industrialization. The symposium required banks at all levels to actively develop regular savings work focusing on workers and taking into account people of other strata. The symposium put forward specific methods for strengthening publicity and facilitating depositors' deposits and withdrawals. After the meeting, People's Banks in major regions, provinces, and cities convened meetings to make arrangements; many regions have already begun to strengthen savings work. The Shenyang Branch of the People's Bank of China has begun to reorganize the savings agencies in the city, and will launch prize-winning fixed-amount savings with convenient deposit and withdrawal procedures starting in May. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has adjusted the business hours of savings institutions throughout the city, so that workers and cadres can also deposit and withdraw money after work; the bank also plans to add 31 small savings institutions in the second quarter in order to gradually establish a city-wide savings network. The newly added small savings institutions have been welcomed by citizens. For example, the Xiheyan Savings Office has accepted deposits of more than 400 million yuan in more than 30 days of operation. At present, People's Banks in major and medium-sized cities have strengthened publicity on savings.

    适应城市人民要求和国家经济建设需要
    各地人民银行加强城市储蓄工作
    【本报讯】各地人民银行正积极加强城市储蓄工作。
    几年来，由于人民生活不断改善，各地城市储蓄存款逐渐增加。截至今年五月上旬，全国城市储蓄存款约为一九五零年年底的十倍。去年各地展开国家过渡时期总任务的宣传以后，广大职工和城市居民深刻认识了节约储蓄对支援国家经济建设的意义，加以几年来，许多人已从实际生活中体会到储蓄的好处，所以更加迫切地要求参加储蓄。许多职工写信要求银行加强储蓄工作；长春市等地的人民代表会议还作出决议，要求银行扩大城市储蓄业务。截至今年五月上旬，全国城市人民在银行存款的数量，即比去年同期增加了百分之四十一点九；西北区增加了一点四倍。
    中国人民银行总行在三月底到四月初召开了城市储蓄工作座谈会，决定进一步开展城市储蓄工作，以适应城市人民对储蓄的新要求，并为国家社会主义工业化积累资金。座谈会要求各级银行积极开展以职工为主兼顾其他阶层人民的经常的储蓄工作。座谈会对加强宣传、便利储户存款取款等工作提出了具体办法。会后，各大区、省、市人民银行先后召开会议，进行布置；许多地区已经着手加强储蓄工作。中国人民银行沈阳分行已开始整理市内的储蓄代理机构，并于五月份起增办存取手续方便的零存整取有奖储蓄。中国人民银行北京分行已调整了全市储蓄机构的对外营业时间，使工人、干部在下班以后也能存款和取款；该行还计划在第二季度增设三十一处小型储蓄机构，以便逐步建立全市的储蓄网。现已增设的小型储蓄机构，受到了市民的欢迎。如西河沿储蓄所对外营业三十多天，即吸收存款四亿余元。目前，各大、中城市的人民银行都加强了关于储蓄的宣传。
