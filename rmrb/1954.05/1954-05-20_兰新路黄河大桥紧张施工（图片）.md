The Yellow River Bridge is one of the key projects of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. Most of its foundation work has to be carried out in the turbulent Yellow River, which is several dozen feet deep, making the project extremely difficult. Thanks to the selfless labor of the workers and the enthusiastic support of the farmers, the project is progressing rapidly. A corner of the Yellow River Bridge construction site.

In the construction of the Yellow River Bridge, local farmers provided a lot of help. The picture shows farmers using sheepskin rafts to transport sand and gravel from the Yellow River upstream, more than 20 miles away, to support the road construction workers.
