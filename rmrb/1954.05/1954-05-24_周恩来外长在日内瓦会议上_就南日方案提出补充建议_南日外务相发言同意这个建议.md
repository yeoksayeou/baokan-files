Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 22nd: The Geneva Conference held its eleventh plenary session on the Korean question at 3 p.m. on the 22nd. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presided.

At the meeting on the 22nd, the speeches of Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, and Nam Il, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, formed a stark contrast with the speech of Byun Young-tae, representative of the Syngman Rhee clique, most clearly demonstrating: who hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, to establish an independent, unified, and democratic Korea; and who opposes a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and wants to turn Korea into an American colony under the police rule controlled by American troops.

At the meeting on the 22nd, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made another significant effort to promote an agreement at the Geneva Conference on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai proposed a supplementary suggestion to Foreign Minister Nam Il's suggestion of April 27th, namely: In order to assist the All-Korea Commission in holding All-Korea elections under free conditions without foreign interference, according to the All-Korea election law, a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be established to supervise the All-Korea elections. This supplementary suggestion was agreed to by Foreign Minister Nam Il, attracting great attention both inside and outside the meeting. General opinion believes that this once again demonstrated the consistent sincerity of the Chinese and Korean sides in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

In contrast, Byun Young-tae, representative of the Syngman Rhee clique, at the instigation of the United States, once again refused to peacefully resolve the Korean question at the meeting on the 22nd. Byun Young-tae put forward so-called fourteen points of suggestion. As pointed out in previous reports, this suggestion was painstakingly pieced together by the fifteen countries invading Korea and the Syngman Rhee clique under the auspices of the United States, the original purpose of which was to deceive world opinion. However, the essence of this suggestion is so obvious that it can be summarized in one sentence: that is, to establish a so-called unified Korea under the supervision and approval of the so-called United Nations, as a belligerent party in Korea, under the occupation and protection of American troops, with Syngman Rhee as president, Syngman Rhee's constitution as the only constitution, and Syngman Rhee's army as the only army. This suggestion, put forward nearly a month after the Geneva Conference was held, can only illustrate one issue, that the American side has no intention of peacefully resolving the Korean question at all.

At the meeting on the 22nd, the first to speak was Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China (full text of the speech will be published separately).

Nam Il, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, spoke next.

Nam Il first pointed out that the American representative and the representatives who followed him, in discussing the Korean question, attempted to portray the American armed intervention against the Korean people as justified, and to impose the anti-popular political system of South Korea on North Korea. Many of these representatives opposed the plan of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and attempted to make us recognize the United Nations resolutions on the Korean question. Nam Il said that the Korean people have never recognized in the past, and will not recognize in the future, the legitimacy of unreasonable United Nations resolutions that disregard their national interests and intend to establish the rule of the Syngman Rhee clique and the United States in our country. Nam Il pointed out that the United Nations, under American pressure, adopted a one-sided stance on the Korean question from the very beginning, and became a belligerent party. Therefore, the United Nations cannot take an impartial stance on the Korean question, and cannot demand that we recognize the legitimacy of the United Nations resolutions on the Korean question.

Nam Il said that in order to resolve the Korean question, other possibilities and avenues should be sought, taking into account first and foremost the national interests of the Korean people and the reality of the situation in North and South Korea. To this end, consultations and agreements should be held at this conference, maintaining the democratic achievements already made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while also considering the particularities of the situation created in South Korea.

Nam Il pointed out that some representatives agree that the question of establishing a unified and democratic Korean state by peaceful means should be decided by the Korean people themselves, but at the same time they firmly advocate the continued occupation of South Korea by American troops. Obviously, this position is contradictory. How can one seriously talk about the Korean people freely expressing their will under the conditions where the occupation system is maintained in South Korea? In order for the Korean people to fully exercise their sovereignty and handle their internal affairs according to their own will, all foreign troops must first be withdrawn from Korean territory. This is an urgent task that the Geneva Conference must complete. Some representatives say that the withdrawal of foreign troops will inevitably lead to armed conflict. We cannot support this pessimistic view. If countries with the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East undertake certain obligations, the peaceful development of Korea can be guaranteed.

Nam Il pointed out that the representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have already stated their willingness to jointly undertake the corresponding obligations with other countries to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France have remained silent on this.

Nam Il then spoke about the issue of prisoners of war. He hopes that this conference will give due attention to the plan put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China, which can properly resolve the issue of prisoners of war.

After refuting the absurd and slanderous statements made by Byun Young-tae in the past, Nam Il pointed out that the South Korean representative stubbornly demanded that elections be held in North Korea according to the South Korean election method. It is not difficult to understand that this attitude of the South Korean ruling clique can be explained by the fact that their subservience to the United States puts them in opposition to the people, fearing to give the people the possibility of freely expressing their will.

Nam Il then listed a large number of ugly facts reported by the foreign press regarding the so-called elections held in South Korea on May 20th, powerfully proving that police brutality and terror are rampant in South Korea, and the people are deprived of the most basic democratic rights and freedoms. Nam Il said that we can understand that the Korean people cannot recognize this type of "election" and that it is justified to have the possibility of expressing their will through genuinely free elections.

Nam Il then pointed out that some representatives, in discussing the plan he proposed, confused two different issues. That is, the issue of the representativeness of the All-Korea National Assembly resulting from the All-Korea elections, and the issue of the temporary All-Korea bilateral institutions formed to prepare for and hold the All-Korea elections. Nam Il explained that the All-Korea Committee can be widely attended by representatives of social organizations with different political orientations from both North and South Korea. Nam Il pointed out that some representatives advocate forming an All-Korea Committee in which members are elected by each side in proportion to the population and decisions are made by majority vote. This means that South Korea can have a decisive voice in the committee and impose its will on North Korea. This view does not take into account the actual situation in Korea and therefore cannot be agreed to. Nam Il pointed out that at present, North and South Korea have different social, economic, and political situations, so the task of establishing a unified Korean state can only be accomplished under the conditions of reaching mutually acceptable agreements. All decisions of the committee should be passed on the basis of agreement between the two sides.

Nam Il pointed out that when holding democratic All-Korea elections to produce the All-Korea National Assembly, electoral districts determined according to equal population will be established throughout the All-Korea region, and the same number of representatives elected from each electoral district will attend the future National Assembly. Therefore, the representativeness of this organ will be guaranteed. Therefore, it is unfounded for some representatives to say that the plan he proposed disregards the principle that the All-Korea National Assembly elections should be conducted according to proportional representation.

Nam Il said that regarding the issue of international supervision of All-Korea elections, we should first emphasize that we should not ignore the special conditions of the Korean people caused by the three years of bloody war between the North and South. Of course, the war has sharpened the relationship between North and South Korea and increased the difficulties in the issue of people's rapprochement and unification. The armistice agreement has been signed, but much more needs to be done to move towards peace and completely eliminate the wounds of war.

Nam Il said that we should not let go of any possibility that can overcome the difficulties that the All-Korea Committee may encounter in carrying out the practical work related to elections. In view of this, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses its agreement with the suggestion put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to supervise the All-Korea elections in order to assist the All-Korea Committee in carrying out the election work. Nam Il said that we believe that the establishment of this international supervision will not violate the basic principle of our plan - that foreign interference in the Korean people's own solution to Korean internal affairs is not allowed.

Nam Il finally expressed his confidence that this conference will adopt an objective attitude towards the plan he put forward and discuss it, and seek ways to ensure a peaceful resolution of the Korean question for the benefit of the Korean people.

After a fifteen-minute break, Byun Young-tae, the South Korean representative, spoke. Byun Young-tae refused the suggestion made by Foreign Minister Nam Il on April 27th without offering any reason other than slander and defamation. He recited the terms manufactured by American "psychological warfare" experts, and even slandered the All-Korea Committee as a "brainwashing organization." Byun Young-tae refused to accept the international guarantees necessary to ensure the peaceful development of Korea, and groundlessly described such guarantees as imposing "trusteeship" on Korea. However, everyone knows that it was the United States that insisted on imposing trusteeship on Korea at the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference. Byun Young-tae's refusal of major powers to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea further proves that the Syngman Rhee clique still intends to unify Korea by force with the support of the United States.

Byun Young-tae also put forward a so-called fourteen-point suggestion. As everyone knows, this suggestion is something that the invading countries cobbled together with great difficulty under the auspices of the United States after holding many meetings. This American-style "suggestion," which is old wine in new bottles, still stipulates that the United Nations, as a belligerent party, should supervise the elections, and it also stipulates that United Nations personnel manipulated by the United States can arbitrarily interfere in all Korean internal affairs. This suggestion stipulates that the elections should be held under the occupation and interference of foreign troops. According to this suggestion, the United Nations forces, which committed the crime of invading Korea, should withdraw only after the elections and the completion of the Syngman Rhee-style unification, while the Chinese People's Volunteers, who resisted this aggression, should withdraw before the elections.

If there is anything "new" in this suggestion with the American trademark, it is that this time it also stipulates that elections should be held throughout Korea, not just in North Korea. However, this "suggestion" immediately stipulates that this election should be held in accordance with South Korea's "constitutional procedures." The "suggestion" also specifically stipulates three reservations, namely: whether the South Korean president is re-elected, whether the "constitution" is amended, and whether the army is changed, will be decided by the parliament created by the United States in the future. In a word, this "suggestion" is to hold an "election" that is pre-determined to impose the South Korean government, army, and Syngman Rhee together on the North Korean people.

Byun Young-tae attempted to deny the inside story of the recent South Korean "elections" revealed by Foreign Minister Nam Il. His only "reason" was that Foreign Minister Nam Il did not personally "observe" the South Korean elections. However, the materials cited by Nam Il are completely reports personally observed by American journalists.

After Byun Young-tae spoke, no one else asked to speak. The chairman announced that the time for the next meeting will be notified separately.

The meeting adjourned at 6:15 p.m.

### 周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上  就南日方案提出补充建议  南日外务相发言同意这个建议

    周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上
    就南日方案提出补充建议
    南日外务相发言同意这个建议
    【新华社日内瓦二十二日电】日内瓦会议在二十二日下午三时举行关于朝鲜问题的第十一次全体会议。苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫担任主席。
    在二十二日的会议上，中华人民共和国周恩来外长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相的发言，和李承晚集团代表卞荣泰的发言形成了强烈的对照，最清楚不过地表明：是谁希望和平解决朝鲜问题，建立一个独立、统一、民主的朝鲜；是谁反对和平解决朝鲜问题，要把朝鲜变成为美国军队控制下的警察统治的美国殖民地。
    周恩来外长在二十二日的会议上又作了一次有重大意义的努力，以促进日内瓦会议就朝鲜问题的和平解决达成协议。周恩来外长对南日外务相四月二十七日的建议提出了一个补充建议，即：为了协助全朝鲜委员会根据全朝鲜选举法在排除外国干涉的自由条件下举行全朝鲜选举，成立中立国监察委员会，对全朝鲜选举进行监察。这个补充建议得到了南日外务相的同意，在会场内外引起了巨大的注意。一般舆论认为，这又一次表现了中、朝方面一贯真诚谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的主动。
    与此相反，李承晚集团代表卞荣泰，在美国的唆使下，在二十二日的会议上又一次拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题。卞荣泰提出了所谓十四点建议。如以前的报道所指出的，这个建议是十五个侵朝国家和李承晚集团在美国主持之下煞费心思拼凑出来的，原来的目的是欺骗世界舆论。但是，这个建议的实质是如此明显，以致人们可以用一句话来加以概括，这就是：要在作为朝鲜交战一方的所谓联合国的监督和批准之下，在美国军队的占领和保护之下，建立一个以李承晚为总统，以李承晚的宪法为唯一的宪法，以李承晚的军队为唯一的军队的所谓统一的朝鲜。这个在日内瓦会议举行了近一个月才提出来的建议，只能说明一个问题，这就是美国方面根本不想和平解决朝鲜问题。
    在二十二日会议上首先发言的是中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来（发言全文另发）。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日接着发言。
    南日首先指出，美国代表及追随他的代表们在讨论朝鲜问题时企图把反对朝鲜人民的美国武装干涉说成是正当的，将南朝鲜的反人民的政治制度强加于北朝鲜。其中许多代表反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的方案，企图使我们承认联合国关于朝鲜问题的决议。南日说，朝鲜人民过去未曾承认，将来也不会承认漠视他们的民族利益并打算在我国建立李承晚集团和美国的统治权的不合理的联合国决议的合法性。南日指出，联合国在美国压力下一开始就在朝鲜问题上采取了片面的立场，并且成为交战的一方。因此联合国对朝鲜问题不能采取公正的立场，并且不能要求我们承认联合国关于朝鲜问题的决议的合法性。
    南日说，为了解决朝鲜问题，应寻求首先考虑到朝鲜人民的民族利益和南北朝鲜现实情况的其他可能性和途径。为此，应在这次会议磋商和协议，保持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所已取得的民主成就，同时应考虑南朝鲜所造成的局势的特殊性。
    南日指出，有些代表赞成以和平方式建立统一的民主的朝鲜国家的问题应由朝鲜人民自己决定，但他们同时坚决主张美国军队继续占领南朝鲜。显然这种立场是矛盾的。在南朝鲜保存着占领制度的条件下，如何能够认真谈到朝鲜人民自由地表示其意志呢？为使朝鲜人民能够充分行使其主权，依据自己的意志处理本国内政，首先必须从朝鲜领土上撤出一切外国军队。这是日内瓦会议必须完成的迫切任务。有些代表说，外国军队的撤退不可避免地导致武装冲突。我们不能支持这种悲观的看法。如果对维护远东和平具有最大关心的国家承担一定的义务的话，朝鲜的和平发展是能够有保证的。
    南日指出，苏联和中华人民共和国的代表已经声称愿和其他国家共同担负保证朝鲜和平发展的相应的义务。但是美、英、法的代表却对此仍保持沉默。
    南日接着谈到战俘问题。他希望本会议对能够正当地解决战俘问题的中华人民共和国代表团提出的方案予以应有的注意。
    南日在驳斥了卞荣泰过去所作的荒谬的诽谤性的发言以后指出，南朝鲜代表固执地要求按照南朝鲜选举的方式来举行北朝鲜的选举。不难理解，南朝鲜统治集团的这种态度是可以由这个事实来解释的：他们向美国献媚，这就使他们自己和人民对立起来，怕给人民以自由表示其意志的可能性。
    南日接着列举了外国报界报道的有关五月二十日在南朝鲜举行的所谓选举的大量丑恶的事实，有力地证明在南朝鲜横行着警察的暴行和恐怖，人民被剥夺了最起码的民主权利和自由。南日说，我们可以了解：朝鲜人民不能承认这一类的“选举”，并且要获得通过真正的自由选举表达自己的意志的可能，这是正当的。
    南日接着指出，有些代表在讨论他所提出的方案时把两个不同的问题混为一谈。那就是由举行全朝鲜选举的结果而产生的全朝鲜国会的代表性问题和为筹备与举行全朝鲜选举而组成临时性的全朝鲜双方机构的问题。南日说明，全朝鲜委员会可由南北朝鲜的具有不同的政治倾向的社会团体代表广泛参加。南日指出，有些代表主张组成一个各方按人口比例选出委员、依多数表决的全朝鲜委员会。这意味着南朝鲜可在该委员会具有决定权，并把自己的意志强加于北朝鲜。这种观点是没有考虑到朝鲜的实际形势的，因此是不能予以同意的。南日指出，目前南北朝鲜存在着不同的社会、经济及政治形势，因此只有在取得互相可接受的协议的条件下，才能完成建立一个统一的朝鲜国家的任务。委员会的一切决议应在双方协议的基础上通过。
    南日指出，在举行全朝鲜的民主选举以产生全朝鲜国会时，在全朝鲜地区内将设立依据同等人口而确定的选举区，自各选区选出的数目相同的代表将出席未来的国会。因而这一机关的代表性将得到保证。因此，有些代表说他所提出的方案不顾全朝鲜国会选举之应按照比例代表制的原则进行，是毫无根据的。
    南日说，关于国际监察全朝鲜选举的问题，我们应该首先强调我们不应忽视由于三年来南北之间流血战争的结果而引起的朝鲜人民所处的特殊条件。当然，战争使朝鲜南北之间的关系更加尖锐，并在人民接近和统一的问题上增加了困难。停战协定业已签订，但要走向和平彻底消除战争创伤，还要做很多事情。
    南日说，我们不应放过任何可以克服全朝鲜委员会在进行有关选举的实际工作中可能遇到的困难的一切可能性。有鉴于此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团对中华人民共和国代表团所提出的为协助全朝鲜委员会进行选举工作组成中立国监察委员会监察全朝鲜选举的建议，表示同意。南日说，我们认为，建立这一国际监察将不违背我们方案的基本原则——不容外国干涉朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜内政的原则。
    南日最后表示确信本会议将对他所提出的方案采取客观态度予以讨论，为了朝鲜人民的利益，寻求保证朝鲜问题的和平解决的途径。
    在休息十五分钟以后，南朝鲜代表卞荣泰发言。卞荣泰除了诬蔑和诽谤以外提不出任何理由就拒绝南日外务相在四月二十七日提出的建议。他背诵美国“心理战”专家所制造的名辞，居然把全朝鲜委员会诬蔑为“洗脑筋组织”。卞荣泰拒绝接受为保证朝鲜和平发展所必需的国际保证，他毫无根据地把这种保证说成是要对朝鲜实行“托管”。然而，谁都知道，在一九四五年莫斯科三外长会议上坚持对朝鲜实行托管的正是美国。卞荣泰拒绝有关大国保证朝鲜的和平发展，进一步证明了李承晚集团仍打算在美国支持下武力统一朝鲜。
    卞荣泰还提出了一个所谓十四点建议。大家知道，这个建议就是侵朝国家在美国主持下开了许多次会议才勉强拼凑出来的东西。这个换汤不换药的美国式的“建议”仍然规定由作为交战一方的联合国监督选举，而且还规定在美国操纵下的联合国人员可以随意干涉朝鲜一切内政。这个建议规定选举要在外国军队占领和干涉之下举行。根据这个建议，犯了侵略朝鲜罪行的联合国军队要在选举和完成了李承晚式的统一之后才撤退，而反抗这种侵略的中国人民志愿军却要在选举之前撤退。
    如果说这个贴着美国商标的建议中有什么“新”的东西的话，那就是这次也规定要在全朝鲜举行选举而不是单单在北朝鲜举行选举。但是，这个“建议”中紧接着又规定，这个选举要按南朝鲜的“宪法程序”来举行。“建议”中还特别规定了三点保留，即：南朝鲜的总统是否重选，“宪法”是否修改，军队是否变动，要待将来由美国一手制造出来的议会决定。一句话，这个“建议”就是要举行一个事先就预定把南朝鲜的政府、军队，连同李承晚一起强加到北朝鲜人民身上的“选举”。
    卞荣泰企图否认南日外务相所揭发的最近南朝鲜“选举”的黑幕。他的唯一的“理由”就是南日外务相没有亲自“观察”南朝鲜的选举。但是，南日引证的材料完全是美国的记者亲自观察的报道。
    卞荣泰发言后，没有其他人要求发言。主席宣布：下次会议在何时举行，另行通知。
    会议在六时十五分休会。
