    Introduction to Dien Bien Phu

    The heroic Vietnamese People's Army finally eliminated the important stronghold of the French invading forces in the Northwest region of Vietnam, Dien Bien Phu, on the 7th. The fierce battle of Dien Bien Phu, which began on March 13, ended here, and the Vietnamese People's Army achieved another brilliant victory.

    Dien Bien Phu is a county in Lai Châu Province in North Vietnam, adjacent to the Laotian border, and occupies a strategic position. Dien Bien Phu is a plain, centered on Mường Thanh, three to eight kilometers wide from east to west, and twenty kilometers long from north to south. It is the largest of the four major plains in Northwest Vietnam. The Yom River, which originates in Lai Châu Province, flows from north to south through the center of the Mường Thanh Plain, flowing into the Nam Ou River in Laos. This river irrigates the fields on both sides and is the center of life for the more than 20,000 Tai, Xa, and Miao people living in Dien Bien Phu.

    On November 20 last year, Naval, the commander-in-chief of the French invading forces, who was determined to seize the military initiative, dispatched about four battalions of troops to airdrop into Dien Bien Phu at the risk of "blocking" the Vietnamese People's Army's offensive against the French troops besieged in the provincial capital of Lai Châu, and re-invade the Northwest Liberation Zone of Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive more than half a month later, quickly annihilating and defeating all the defending enemies in Lai Châu, and advancing towards Dien Bien Phu. At this time, Naval transferred nine more battalions of elite troops from other battlefields and airdropped them into Dien Bien Phu, which was surrounded on all sides. These thirteen battalions accounted for one-third of the French army's mobile forces in North Vietnam and one-fifth of the mobile forces in Indochina.

    With the support of the United States, the French army established a so-called group stronghold with many bunkers in Dien Bien Phu. Every day, about 130 American aircraft transported and dropped 300 to 400 tons of American weapons. The center of the group stronghold was Mường Thanh, where the French army headquarters was located. The Associated Press revealed that "this stronghold is the most heavily defended place among all French positions. The only path to this underground headquarters is a narrow path one yard wide through minefields and heavy barbed wire. The headquarters is guarded by bunkers, machine gun nets, and deep trenches." With tens of thousands of French troops stationed and hundreds of tons of American weapons equipped, Dien Bien Phu was once boasted as an "aircraft carrier in the mountains."

    However, none of these could stop the advance of the heroic and resourceful Vietnamese People's Army. On March 13, the People's Army launched an offensive and destroyed the French army's strong northern defense line in just four days, and gradually narrowed the encirclement. The offensive of the Vietnamese People's Army greatly alarmed the French and American warmongers. U.S. President Eisenhower even repeatedly cheered for the French army in Dien Bien Phu, urging them to fight for their lives, and dispatched U.S. Air Force personnel and increased aircraft to participate in the battle. The French colonists repeatedly airdropped reinforcements, making a desperate struggle. As late as April 21, Cogniet, the commander of the French invading forces in North Vietnam, was still boasting that the battle of Dien Bien Phu might "last for a long time." By May 6, the French General Command was still making "the greatest efforts" and using a large part of its aircraft in Indochina to carry out large-scale airdrops to Dien Bien Phu. But all this struggle finally could not save the fate of the French army in Dien Bien Phu from being annihilated.

    The demise of the French army in Dien Bien Phu was a serious blow to the American and French colonialists. The Associated Press said: "This is France's most惨 defeat since 1940," and "it is expected that a sense of defeatism will be prevalent in the French forces in Indochina." (Xinhua News Agency)

    奠边府介绍
    英雄的越南人民军已在七日最后拔除了法国侵略军在越南西北地区的重要据点奠边府。从三月十三日开始的剧烈的奠边府战斗到此结束，越南人民军又取得了一次辉煌的胜利。
    奠边府是北越莱州省的一个县，邻近寮国边境，位居要冲。奠边府是一个平原，以芒清为中心，东西宽三到八公里，南北长二十公里，是越南西北四大平原中最大的一个。发源在莱州省的约姆河自北而南从芒清平原的中心穿过，流往寮国的南乌江。这条河流灌溉着两岸田地，是居住在奠边府的两万多泰族、舍族和苗族人民的生活中心。
    在去年十一月二十日，一心想夺取军事主动权的法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔，抽调了四个营左右的兵力冒险空降到奠边府，企图“挡住”越南人民军对被围困在莱州省会的法军的进攻，并重新侵犯越南西北解放区。但是，越南人民军在半个多月之后就展开攻势，迅速歼灭和击溃了莱州的全部守敌，进逼奠边府。这时纳瓦尔又从其他战场抽调九个营的精锐部队空投到四面被围的奠边府。这十三个营的兵力，占法军在北越的机动部队的三分之一，在印度支那的机动部队的五分之一。
    在美国的支援下，法军在奠边府建立起碉堡林立的所谓集团据点。每天曾有一百三十架左右的美国飞机运投三四百吨的美国武器。集团据点的中心是芒清，法军的司令部就设在这里，合众社曾透露，“这个据点是所有法军阵地中防御得最牢固的一个地方。通到这个地下司令部的只有一条穿过布雷区和重重铁丝网的一码宽的小径。司令部有地堡、机枪网和深壕沟拱卫着”。在上万名的法军据守和成百吨的美国武器配备下，奠边府曾被吹嘘为“山林中的航空母舰”。
    但是，这些都不能阻挡英勇机智的越南人民军的前进。三月十三日，人民军开始发动攻势，仅在四天之内就摧毁了法军的强固的北部防线，并日益缩小包围圈。越南人民军的攻势使法美好战分子十分惊慌。美国总统艾森豪威尔甚至一再为奠边府法军打气，要他们卖命，并派遣美国空军人员和增派飞机参与战斗。法国殖民者一再空投援兵，进行垂死挣扎。直至四月二十一日，侵越法军北越司令戈涅还在吹嘘，奠边府之战可能“持久”。到五月六日，法军总司令部还在作“最大的努力”，把它在印度支那的一大部分飞机用来向奠边府进行大规模的空投。但是，这一切的挣扎终于不能挽救奠边府法军覆没的命运。
    奠边府法军的覆灭使美法殖民者受到严重打击。合众社说：“这是法国自一九四零年以来最惨的失败”，“预料失败主义的情绪将普遍于印度支那法国部队”。（新华社）
