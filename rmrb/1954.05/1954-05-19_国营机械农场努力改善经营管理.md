State-Owned Mechanized Farms Strive to Improve Business Management
[This newspaper report] (By this newspaper) Various state-owned mechanized farms are actively improving their business management during spring plowing and production, striving to increase yields and reduce costs.

In the Northeast and North China regions, the farms have summarized past experiences and, based on local natural conditions, generally advanced the sowing of spring crops by about ten days to half a month. When sowing wheat, due to strengthened planned management and the implementation of the technical responsibility system, the sowing time was generally shortened by three days to more than ten days compared to the past.

All farms are paying great attention to seed treatment and increased fertilizer application during spring sowing. According to incomplete statistics from ten directly affiliated farms in Northeast China, detailed variety identification of wheat seeds, coupled with selection, disinfection, and methods to improve seed germination rates, can save approximately 400,000 catties of wheat seeds. In the past, farms in Northeast China rarely applied fertilizer. However, after key experiments last year, it was proven that appropriate fertilization can increase yields by about 20%. Therefore, this year, farms are expanding the area of fertilizer application more widely based on soil conditions. The wheat fertilization area of ten directly affiliated farms in Northeast China totals more than 10,700 hectares, accounting for 45% of the wheat sowing area; the soybean fertilization area is planned to be more than 2,500 hectares, accounting for about 24% of the sowing area. The Northwest Caotan Farm applied more than 370,000 catties of oil cake fertilizer to more than 2,000 mu of cotton fields during spring harrowing. The employees of the Huadong Lianhu Farm worked hard to accumulate natural fertilizer, providing all the base fertilizer needed for paddy fields.

This year, all farms have generally streamlined their organizations and reduced personnel based on production needs. The nine farms in East China plan to reduce more than 600 employees this year (approximately 35% of the original number) and transfer them to work on new farms. Farms in Northeast China are also generally implementing the principle of combining capital construction with production, reducing the number of capital construction workers from more than 3,000 last year to more than 300. Capital construction work on each farm is done by agricultural workers concurrently, engaging in production during the busy farming season and construction during the slack season, in order to fully organize and utilize labor and reduce costs. Due to the trial implementation of planned production and planned expenditure at the Dongxin Farm in Jiangsu Province, with each production unit working according to the operation plan, output increased by more than 78 million yuan in the first quarter. The "May 3rd" Farm in the Central South region improved technical measures and enhanced the quality of mechanized farming operations, estimating that it can save about 700 million yuan this year.

    国营机械农场努力改善经营管理
   【本报讯】各地国营机械农场在春耕生产中，积极改进经营管理，努力争取提高产量和降低成本。
    东北、华北各场总结往年经验，根据当地自然条件，春播作物普遍适当提前十天到半月左右播种。播种小麦时，由于加强了计划管理，贯彻了技术责任制，播种时间一般都比过去缩短了三天到十多天。
    各场在春播中对种籽处理和增施肥料都很重视。据东北直属十个场的不完全统计，由于对小麦种籽进行了详细的品种鉴定，并全部经过选种、消毒以及施行提高种籽发芽率等方法，约可节省麦种四十多万斤。东北各场往年很少施肥，经过去年重点试验，证明适当施肥可以提高产量百分之二十左右，因此，今年各场根据土壤情况，较普遍地扩大了施肥面积。东北直属十个场的小麦施肥面积共一万零七百多垧，占小麦播种面积百分之四十五；大豆施肥面积计划二千五百多垧，占播种面积百分之二十四左右。西北草滩农场春耙时就在二千多亩棉田中施用了三十七万多斤油渣。华东练湖农场职工努力增积自然肥料，供给了全部水田所需基肥。
    今年各场普遍根据生产需要，紧缩机构，精减人员。华东九场今年计划减少职工六百余人（约占原人数百分之三十五），调往新场工作。东北各场并普遍实行基本建设与生产相结合的原则，把基本建设的职工从去年三千多人缩减到三百多人。各场基本建设工作由农工兼做，农忙生产，农闲建设，以达到充分组织利用劳动力、降低成本的目的，江苏省东辛农场由于试行了计划生产、计划支出，各生产单位按作业计划进行工作，因此，第一季度就增产了七千八百多万元。中南区“五三”农场改进技术措施，提高机耕作业质量，估计今年可节约七亿元左右。
