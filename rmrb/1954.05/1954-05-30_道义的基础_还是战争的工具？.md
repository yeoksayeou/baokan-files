	“Moral Foundation” or Tool of War?
	By Our Correspondent Wu Wentao
	In addition to the US-French negotiations and the Southeast Asia war bloc negotiations, another conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the Geneva Conference is being manufactured by war provocateurs in the US State Department.

	The incident occurred when the Geneva Conference's discussions on the Indochina issue were making progress in secret sessions, and when the proposal by Pham Van Dong, head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, aroused enthusiastic reactions in European (including French) public opinion.

	On May 25th, a representative of the Thai delegation to the Geneva Conference, Koman, the Deputy Permanent Representative of Thailand to the United Nations, suddenly left Geneva and flew to New York.

	Prince Wang Waiyakon, head of the Thai delegation, announced to Agence France-Presse the next day that "the Thai government commissioned" Koman to go to New York to "appeal" to the United Nations Security Council, requesting the United Nations to send peace observers to Thailand to observe. According to Prince Wang, after the Vietnam People's Army liberated Dien Bien Phu, "Thailand believes that there is a situation endangering peace."

	French newspapers frankly stated who the real director of this ridiculous play was. The "Combat" newspaper on May 26th said: "According to reliable sources, it is certain that the Bangkok government's initiative was proposed entirely at the behest of the US State Department."

	Observers in Geneva have been paying attention to a series of activities by American politicians for several days, which foreshadow that if Smith cannot prevent the Geneva Conference from making progress, the State Department will inevitably resort to another new trick.

	As early as May 23rd, Agence France-Presse sent a message from Washington saying: "The Geneva Conference is about to enter a 'decisive week.' At this time, in Washington's view, a new factor has emerged in the Indochina issue. According to reliable sources, the idea of appealing to the United Nations has developed considerably."

	News from across the Atlantic made no secret of the fact that a whole set of conspiracies had been arranged behind this so-called "appeal." The "Washington Star" on the same day published a report from its "diplomatic sources" saying that the United States was ready to have Thailand, or the puppet regimes of Cambodia and Laos, request the United Nations to send a peace observation group to Indochina. Then these countries could report so-called "communist aggression," and then the United States could manipulate the United Nations to approve its armed intervention.

	The US State Department has meticulously calculated that June will be the month when the US representative takes over the presidency of the Security Council on a rotating basis, which provides convenience for handling this "appeal." Moreover, even the prospect that this approach will inevitably be vetoed by the Soviet Union in the Security Council has been considered. Therefore, the United States has planned to disregard the provisions of the UN Charter and raise this issue to the General Assembly of the United Nations, which it controls. According to a Washington dispatch in the London "Times" on May 22nd, the procedure predetermined by the US State Department is: "First persuade countries constituting a simple majority to support the convening of a special meeting to consider it, and then gather a two-thirds majority in the United Nations General Assembly to support this proposal."

	Everyone can see how strikingly similar this plan is to the process by which the United States launched the Korean War. The same methods, the same steps, serving the same purpose.

	Everyone can see that the final result of implementing this plan is to expand the Indochina war, which has now shown hope of stopping, into a Korean-style internationalized large-scale tragedy.

	It is clear that everything has been arranged by the United States, and then it will only take the hand of the United Nations to put a stamp on it, but in the eyes of the United States, this is necessary. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington believes that "this will become the 'moral foundation' that the Eisenhower administration believes is indispensable for US military intervention in Southeast Asia."

	What a "moral foundation." Relying on such a "moral foundation," you can send troops, dispatch planes and warships, travel across the ocean to Asia to kill, set fires, and act like a tyrant; relying on such a "moral foundation," you can add the most beautiful words to all the ugliest behaviors in the world; on this "moral foundation," death, plague, gasoline bombs... can all become "freedom," "justice," "collective security"...

	People have already learned from the Korean War that the "moral foundation" touted by the State Department's diplomats is nothing more than a tool used by the Pentagon's generals to conduct war.

	However, the influential groups in the United States still want to pick up this fig leaf, which has long been worn out in the Korean War, because in their view, their "moral foundation" is so pitiful that they can't find anything else to rely on. When advocating the plan for UN intervention, American newspapers unscrupulously talked about how the "pressure" of the "UN majority" could make many countries "unite."

	There are some people who have no good feelings about American military intervention, or about the so-called Southeast Asia Group or Pacific Alliance that conceals this intervention, but they have illusions about the so-called "mediation" of the United Nations. If the Korean War under the banner of the United Nations has not taught these people anything, then now people can see that the United Nations "mediating" in Indochina under the manipulation of the United States is just providing a signboard for the United States to expand the Indochina war.

	Any suggestion that hopes for UN "mediation" will hit the US's intention. No matter what the motive of this proposal, the United States will link it with its own plan and turn the United Nations "mediation" into American intervention. The United States will welcome this suggestion, which in its view can become the "moral foundation" for supporting its war.

	One of the main means by which the United States promotes its "policy of strength" is to manipulate the United Nations to engage in activities that are completely contrary to the purpose of "maintaining international peace and security" stipulated in the UN Charter. The daily facts eloquently prove the accurate judgment made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, head of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, on the United Nations. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out at the Geneva Conference on May 3rd: "The United Nations has lost its moral strength to deal with the Korean issue and other Asian issues."

	Regarding the plan to use the United Nations, it is said that US Secretary of State Dulles is still considering only the question of "what strategy" to use and "when" to formally propose it. According to the "New York Herald Tribune": The United States is not yet sure, "I don't know how much support there is for this proposal. It is believed that the State Department is testing the opinions of other countries."

	What can be seen now is that Koman was entertained by a banquet hosted by the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, as soon as he arrived in New York. Representatives of the sixteen countries that participated in the Korean War under the banner of the United Nations attended the banquet. It is expected that more frequent diplomatic activities will be carried out under the auspices of Lodge within the United Nations.

	Another anti-peace conspiracy has begun. All peace-loving people in the world have a responsibility to thwart this sinister conspiracy.

	In this struggle, the people of Asia and the people of all colonies have a major role to play. Under the manipulation of Western imperialism, the United Nations has not relieved the people of Asia and the colonial people of any disasters, if not bringing greater disasters. On the issue of mediating the Kashmir dispute, on the issue of demanding condemnation of colonial rule in Morocco and Tunisia, on the issue of demanding a stop to racial discrimination in South Africa, when the people of Asia and colonial countries hoped to receive "moral" support from the United Nations, they received only a flat refusal. However, when the people of Asia demand freedom and independence, the banner of the United Nations is used to cover up the most brutal intervention, as the Korean War has proven. Now such a danger is foreshadowed on the issue of Indochina. The Asian people must not forget that whether the UN intervention is in Korea or Indochina, blood is flowing on Asian soil.

	All Asian countries with self-respect refused to support the US's intervention war in Korea under the banner of the United Nations. This fact, to a considerable extent, helped the effort to achieve peace in Korea. The current situation requires the people of all Asia to unite as one to oppose the new threat of war; we should be fully vigilant about any conspiracy that may be contained in any involvement of the United Nations in the Indochina issue. The concerted efforts of the Asian people and peace-loving people around the world can defeat any such conspiracy.　　　　May 28th

### “道义的基础”还是战争的工具？

    “道义的基础”还是战争的工具？
    本报记者　吴文焘
    在美法谈判与东南亚战争集团的谈判而外，又一个以破坏日内瓦会议为目的的阴谋，正由美国国务院的战争挑拨者在制造中。
    事情发生在日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论正在秘密会议中开始取得进展的时候，发生在越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同的建议在欧洲（包括法国在内）舆论界引起热烈的反应的时候。
    五月二十五日，出席日内瓦会议的泰国代表团的一位代表，泰国驻联合国的常任副代表科曼突然离开日内瓦飞赴纽约。
    据泰国代表团团长旺·威泰耶康亲王第二天向法新社记者宣布：“泰国政府委派”科曼到纽约去的目的，是要向联合国安全理事会“呼吁”，要求联合国派遣和平观察员到泰国去观察。据这位旺亲王说：在越南人民军解放奠边府以后，“泰国认为存在着一种危及和平的局势。”
    法国报纸坦白地说出了在这种可笑的说法后面，谁是这出戏的真正导演人。五月二十六日的
  “战斗报”说：“据可靠消息，可以肯定曼谷政府的这个创议完全是在美国国务院授意之后提出的。”
    日内瓦的观察家，几天以来就注意到了美国政界的一系列活动，这些活动预示如果史密斯不能阻止日内瓦会议取得进展，国务院就必然要祭起另一件新的法宝来。
    早在五月二十三日，法新社就从华盛顿发出了一则消息说：“日内瓦会议就要进入‘决定性的一周’了。这时，在华盛顿看来，印度支那问题上出现了一个新的因素，据可靠方面消息，向联合国呼吁的这种主张已有相当的发展了。”
    来自大西洋彼岸的消息，毫不讳言在这个所谓
  “呼吁”后面已经布置好了一整套的阴谋。同一天的“华盛顿明星报”发表该报“从外交方面得到的消息”说，美国已准备好了要泰国，或高棉和寮国的傀儡政权，向联合国提出派遣和平观察组到印度支那去，然后这些国家就可以报告有所谓“共产党的侵略”，然后美国就可以操纵联合国批准其武装干涉。
    美国国务院精密地盘算好了，六月份是美国代表轮值安理会主席，这给受理这个“呼吁”提供了便利。而且，甚至这种做法必然会在安全理事会内受到苏联否决的前景，也考虑过了。因此，美国已计划好不顾联合国宪章的规定，再把这个问题提到在它操纵下的联合国大会去。据伦敦“泰晤士报”五月二十二日的华盛顿专讯透露，美国国务院预定的程序是：“先劝说好能构成简单多数的各国，支持召开一个特别会议来考虑，然后再在联合国大会纠集三分之二的多数，来支持这个建议”。
    每一个人都看得出，这个计划与美国发动朝鲜战争的过程之间是如何惊人地酷似。同样的手法，同样的步骤，服务于同样的目的。
    每一个人都看得出，执行这个计划的最后结果，就是要把目前已经出现了有停止的希望的印度支那战争，扩大成为一场朝鲜式的国际化的大规模惨剧。
    分明是一切都由美国布置好了，然后不过再由它拿住联合国的手指头来按一个印，然而在美国看来这却是必需的。据法新社说，华盛顿人士认为：“这将成为艾森豪威尔政府所认为对于美国军事干涉东南亚所不可或缺的‘道义的基础’”。
    好一个“道义的基础”。靠了这样一个“道义的基础”，就可以派遣军队，出动飞机、兵舰，远涉重洋到亚洲来杀人放火，称王称霸；靠了这样一个“道义的基础”，就可以把人世间一切最丑恶的行为都加上最美丽的字样；在这一个“道义的基础”上，死亡瘟疫、汽油弹……就都可以变成“自由”、“正义”、“集体安全”……。
    人们已经在朝鲜事件中，领教过了国务院的外交家用来吹嘘的“道义的基础”，不过是五角大楼的将军们用来进行战争的工具而已。
    然而，美国的有势力集团所以还要捡起这块在朝鲜战争中早已用烂了的遮羞布，是因为在他们看来，他们的“道义的基础”是如此可怜，以致除此以外，再也找不到什么可以凭借的了。美国报纸在鼓吹联合国干涉的计划时，肆无忌惮地谈到“联合国多数”的“压力”可以使许多国家“一致”起来。
    有这样一些人，他们对于美国的军事干涉，对于掩饰这种干涉的所谓东南亚集团或者太平洋联盟，并没有什么好感，但是却对联合国的所谓“斡旋”寄予幻想。如果在联合国旗帜下的朝鲜事件，还没有使这些人们得到什么教益的话，那么，现在人们可以看到由美国操纵下的联合国来“斡旋”印度支那，只不过是为美国扩大印度支那战争提供一个招牌而已。
    任何一种寄希望于联合国的“斡旋”的建议，都将正中美国的心意。不论这种建议出于什么动机，美国都将把它和自己的计划联系起来，把联合国的“斡旋”变成美国的干涉。美国将欢迎这种建议，在它看来这就可以成为支持它进行战争的“道义的基础”。
    美国推行其“实力政策”的主要手段之一，就是操纵联合国进行与联合国宪章所规定的“维护国际和平与安全”的宗旨完全相反的勾当。每天发生的事实，雄辩地证明了中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来外长对于联合国所作的确切评断。周恩来外长在五月三日的日内瓦会议上指出：“联合国丧失了处理朝鲜问题和其他亚洲问题的道义力量”。
    关于利用联合国的计划，据说美国国务卿杜勒斯还在盘算的只是“用什么战略”，以及“在什么时候”正式提出的问题了。据“纽约先驱论坛报”透露：美国现在还没有把握，“不知道对这一建议究竟有多少赞助的意见。据信，国务院正在试探其他国家的意见。”
    现在可以看到的是，科曼一到纽约就受到美国驻联合国常任代表洛奇设宴招待。出席宴会的，有在联合国旗帜之下参加了朝鲜战争的十六个国家驻联合国的代表。预料在联合国内，更频繁的外交活动就要在洛奇主持下进行。
    又一个反对和平的阴谋开始了。全世界一切爱好和平的人们都有责任来挫败这一罪恶的阴谋。
    在这个斗争中，亚洲人民和各殖民地的人民有着重大的作用。在西方帝国主义的操纵之下，联合国没有为亚洲人民和殖民地人民解除什么灾难，如果不是带来更大的灾难的话。在调解克什米尔争端的问题上，在要求谴责在摩洛哥与突尼斯的殖民统治的问题上，在要求制止南非种族歧视的问题上，当亚洲与殖民地国家人民希望从联合国得到“道义”的声援的时候，他们得到的只是断然的拒绝。然而当亚洲人民要求自由与独立的时候，联合国的旗帜就被用来掩盖最残酷的干涉，朝鲜事件已经证明了这一点。现在在印度支那问题上又预示着这样的危险。亚洲人民不能忘记，不论联合国的干涉是在朝鲜还是在印度支那，血都是流在亚洲的土地上。
    一切有自尊心的亚洲国家，都拒绝支持美国打着联合国旗帜在朝鲜的干涉战争。这个事实，在相当的程度上帮助了在朝鲜实现和平的努力。目前的形势，要求全亚洲的人民一致团结起来，反对新的战争威胁；应该充分地警惕到，联合国在印度支那问题上任何介入所可能包藏的阴谋。亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致努力，是可以击破任何这类阴谋的。　　　　五月二十八日
