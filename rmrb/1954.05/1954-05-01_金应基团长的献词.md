    Dedicatory Message from Kim Ung-ki, Head of the Delegation

    Respected Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong:

    The Korean People's Delegation to China feels infinitely honored to be able to present to you today, revered Chairman, a gift of sincerity from the Korean people.

    Respected Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong!

    The great Chinese people have given all the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army enormous material and spiritual assistance, which has infinitely inspired us. Today, we pay the highest honor and sincere gratitude to the great Chinese people and their wise leader—you.

    During the Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War, the material and spiritual assistance given by the great Chinese people under the sacred banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea," and especially the collective heroism displayed by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army commanders and fighters on the Korean front, were a tremendous force for our victory in the war. Today, in the post-war period, the fraternal Chinese people, together with the people of the people's democratic countries headed by the great Soviet Union, are giving us great assistance, which is a powerful guarantee for our victory in the struggle to restore and develop the post-war people's economy.

    Respected Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong!

    The great victories and achievements made by the Korean people in the just Fatherland Liberation War for freedom and independence, and in the struggle to restore and build the post-war people's economy, are closely linked with the consistent, sincere, and internationalist assistance given to us by the fraternal Chinese people under your respected leadership.

    Therefore, today all the Korean people are filled with boundless love and respect for the great Chinese people, and are dedicating all their strength to consolidating and developing the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, forged in blood.

    Today, workers, farmers, youths, women, and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Army in every corner of our country have entrusted our delegation to present to you, esteemed Chairman, gifts made by their own hands.

    Respected Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong!

    The Korean People's Delegation to China respectfully requests that you, revered Chairman, accept this sincere gift from the Korean people. In order to further strengthen the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, for the prosperity and strength of the fraternal People's Republic of China, and for lasting peace in Asia and the world, we wish you—revered Chairman Mao—a long life, long life, long life!

    金应基团长的献词敬爱的毛泽东主席同志：
    朝鲜人民访华代表团今天能够向敬爱的您赠送朝鲜人民至诚的礼物，感到无限的光荣。
    尊敬的毛泽东主席同志！
    伟大的中国人民曾给予了全体朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军将士们以巨大的物质上和精神上的援助，这种巨大的援助无限地鼓舞了我们。今天，我们敬向伟大的中国人民及其英明的领袖——您，致以最崇高的荣誉和诚挚的感谢。
    在朝鲜人民正义的祖国解放战争时期，伟大的中国人民在“抗美援朝”的神圣的旗帜下，所给予的物质上和精神上的援助，特别是英雄的中国人民志愿军指战员们在朝鲜前线发挥的集体英雄主义，曾经是我们取得战争胜利的巨大力量。今天，在战后时期，兄弟般的中国人民和以伟大的苏联为首的各人民民主国家人民一道又给予我们巨大的援助，这种援助乃是我们在恢复和发展战后人民经济的斗争中，取得胜利的有力的保证之一。
    尊敬的毛泽东主席同志！
    朝鲜人民在为争取自由和独立的正义的祖国解放战争时期，以及在恢复和建设战后人民经济的斗争中，所取得的伟大的胜利和成就，是与在尊敬的您领导下的兄弟般的中国人民所给予我们的始终如一的、真诚的、国际主义的援助紧密连结在一起的。
    因此，今天全朝鲜人民对伟大的中国人民满怀着无限热爱和尊敬，并正在为巩固和发展朝中两国人民以鲜血凝结成的友谊团结而献出自己所有的力量。
    今天，我国各个角落里的工人、农民、青年、妇女及人民军全体指战员们委托我们代表团将他们亲手制成的礼物转赠给尊敬的您。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席同志！
    朝鲜人民访华代表团谨请敬爱的您，接受朝鲜人民的这项至诚的礼物。为了进一步加强朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结，为了兄弟般的中华人民共和国的繁荣富强，为了亚洲和世界持久和平，我们谨祝您——敬爱的毛主席——万寿无疆。
