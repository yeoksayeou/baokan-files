Korean Workers Struggle to Rebuild the Fatherland

Reconstruction Work at the Glass Factory Proceeds Day and Night

The warm sunlight shines on the glass windows of the newly built workshop of this glass factory, and the ice flowers that froze on the windows at night begin to melt. The heat emanating from the dissolving furnace, heating furnace, and cooling furnace makes all the workshops warm. The workers are working hard. Through the glass window, you can clearly see the red horizontal banner in the yard:

"Respond to the leader's call, make full preparations, and strive to produce glass before May Day!"

Last August, Marshal Kim Il-sung personally inspected this factory and encouraged the workers to make all preparations to produce glass before this year's May Day. The leader's words immediately turned into a driving force to encourage the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

Restoration work is proceeding day and night, and production innovators are constantly emerging. Quan Wanran, a chemical glass manufacturer, modified the internal device of the dissolving furnace, overcame the difficulty of lacking foreign lump coal, and saved the country more than 130,000 won (Korean currency) per month. Bottle maker Kim Tae-yeon and forging worker Kim In-hwa both exceeded their monthly production quotas by more than double. All the workers at the furnace construction site collected 300,000 bricks and tens of thousands of refractory bricks, making a great contribution to the factory's construction.

Machines from the Soviet Union and China are constantly being transported to the construction site. Chinese bricklayers are also participating in the furnace building work at this factory. Thirty workers who returned from internships in China have also devoted themselves to the intense labor of rebuilding their own factory.

Metallurgical Workers

A tall chimney stands on the coast of Yonghung Bay. In the morning, the sea breeze blows puffs of black smoke into the sky. By noon, the black smoke gradually thins out, and the steelmaking time is approaching. At 12:20, the warm sunlight shines on the "Minqing" blast furnace. The workers are working nervously by the furnace, making preparations for the ten minutes before steelmaking. At 12:30, a red flag is planted next to the blast furnace, the furnace door slowly opens, and the molten furnace water gushes out. The smelting workers are all sweating profusely, but their faces show victorious smiles. Then, they replaced the red flag with a blue flag, the smelting work began again, and the chimney emitted black smoke again...

This is the metallurgical factory led by Director Wen Bimo, who was born as a worker. During the war, the enemy dropped more than 80,000 large and small mines and more than 30,000 incendiary bombs on this factory, and fired more than 30,000 shells. However, less than three months after the cessation of hostilities, a metallurgical factory reappeared, and the repaired "Minqing" blast furnace was further mechanized than before. The three machines invented by worker Park Wen-zhong have created great wealth for the country. He has completely mechanized the handling equipment. He also transformed the battery car, which had been regarded as waste for more than ten years, into an electric locomotive, using it to replace more than 500 manual handling of steel slag flowing out of the blast furnace, saving three-quarters of the labor in the handling work.

Overfulfilling Alcohol Production Plan

An alcohol factory in a certain area of Korea is stepping up reconstruction.

At the time of the armistice, this was a ruin. The restoration task before all employees was so urgent: the crushing workshop, saccharification workshop, and fermentation workshop had to be repaired before the end of the year, and one million kilograms of alcohol had to be produced.

However, they are brave and hardworking Korean workers. They overcame all difficulties and not only completed but also exceeded the tasks of restoration and production. Engineer Kim Hyung-oh repaired the fermentation tank and created excellent special bacteria. Installation worker Jiang Shunji repaired more than 1,600 meters of pneumatic conveying pipes and more than 800 meters of raw material conveying pipes. Female pipe worker Li Shunzi completed the construction of the saccharification tank, which usually takes a week, in four days.

On December 10 last year, the workers installed boilers in the ice and snow, providing a large amount of heat and steam to the saccharification workshop. On December 17, they finally overfulfilled the planned production plan, producing 1,246,000 kilograms of various alcohols.

The small brewery, which was scheduled to be completed before the end of January this year, was also completed on January 28 and began producing beer. A magnificent and splendid workers' club has also been built.

"Women's Factory"

Eight months ago, the Pyongyang bulb factory was still a scorched earth and rubble. Now, no trace of the war can be found here. Various trees planted around the factory last autumn have begun to sprout green, and the two flower beds on both sides of the factory gate have been built. The magnificent new factory buildings of the bulb assembly workshop, gas workshop, and glass workshop have also stood tall. The tall chimney is spewing thick smoke day and night.

People call this factory the "Women's Factory" because the main force of this factory is the female workers. They guarded this factory with blood and restored and rebuilt it with labor. On November 5 last year, the first whistle to start production sounded here. On the second day of operation, they launched a production increase competition. Individual competitions, class competitions, and workshop competitions were launched enthusiastically. Soon after, new machines from the Chinese people to support the construction of Korea were transported here, further boosting the workers' enthusiasm for labor. In the first ten days of starting to work with the new machines, they increased the production volume to 106%, and in the second ten days they increased it to 113%, and improved the quality.

    为重建祖国而斗争的朝鲜工人们
    玻璃工厂重建工作昼夜进行
    和煦的阳光照在这个玻璃工厂新建车间的玻璃窗上，窗上夜间冻上的冰花开始融化了；从溶解炉、加热炉和冷却炉里发散出来的热气，把所有车间都变得暖烘烘的，工人们正在紧张地劳动着，从玻璃窗看出去，可以清楚地看到院子里张起的红色横联：
    “响应领袖号召，做好充分准备，争取‘五一’节前生产玻璃！”
    去年八月，金日成元帅曾亲自视察了这个工厂，鼓励职工们做好一切准备，在今年“五一”节前生产玻璃。领袖的话立即变成鼓舞职工劳动热情的动力。
    恢复工作昼夜进行，生产革新者不断涌现。化学玻璃制造工全万然改造了溶解炉的内部装置，克服了缺乏外国块炭的困难，每月给国家节省了十三万元（朝鲜币）以上的财富。制瓶工金泰连、锻造工金仁化都把每月的生产定额超额完成一倍以上。筑炉工地的全体工人收集了三十万块砖和几万块耐火砖，在工厂修建工作中作了很大的贡献。
    建筑工地上不断运到来自苏联和中国的机器。中国的砌砖工人也参加了这个工厂的砌炉工作。从中国实习归来的三十名工人，也投入重建自己工厂的紧张劳动中了。化炼金属的人们
      一座高大的烟囱在永兴湾海岸上矗立起来了。早晨，海风把一团团黑烟吹向天边。到了中午，黑烟渐渐稀少起来，出钢时间快要到了。十二点二十分，温暖的阳光照在“民青号”熔矿炉上。工人们在炉边紧张地进行着出钢前十分钟的准备工作。十二时三十分，一面红旗插在熔矿炉边，炉门徐徐开启，通红的炉水喷涌出来，熔解工人们都满头大汗，但脸上却露出胜利的微笑。接着，他们又用蓝旗代替了红旗，熔解工作又开始了，烟囱又冒出了黑烟……。
    这里就是工人出身的文弼模厂长领导的化炼工厂。战争期间，敌人向这座工厂投下了八万多颗大小地雷弹和三万多颗燃烧弹，并发射了三万多颗炮弹，但是炮火停息不到三个月一座化炼工厂又出现了，修复后的“民青号”熔矿炉比以前进一步机械化了。工人朴文中发明的三种机器，给国家创造了很大的财富，他把搬运设备完全机械化了。他还把十多年来当作废物的电瓶车改造成电气机车，用它代替了五百多个人力搬运从熔矿炉流出的钢渣，节省了搬运工作中四分之三的劳动力。超额完成酒精生产计划
    朝鲜某地的酒精工厂正在加紧重建中。
    停战时，这里是一片废墟，摆在全体职工面前的恢复任务，是如此紧迫：年底以前要修复粉碎车间、糖化车间和发酵车间，还要生产一百万公斤的酒精。
    但是，他们是勇敢勤劳的朝鲜工人，他们克服了一切困难，不但完成而且超过了恢复和生产的任务。工程师金亨五修好了发酵槽并且创造了优良的特殊菌。装置工姜顺吉修复了全长一千六百多公尺的气压运送管和八百多公尺的原料运送管，制管女工李顺子四天完成一星期的糖化槽修建工作。
    去年十二月十日，工人们在冰天雪地中安装了锅炉，给糖化车间供应了大量的热力和蒸气。十二月十七日，他们终于超额完成了预定的生产计划，生产各种酒精一百二十四万六千公斤。
    预定在今年一月底以前完成的小啤酒工厂也在一月二十八日完工，开始生产啤酒了。宏大而华丽的工人俱乐部也建筑起来了。“妇女工厂”
    八个月以前，平壤灯泡工厂还是一片焦土和瓦砾。现在，在这里已经找不到战争的痕迹了。去年秋天工厂周围种植的各种树木，已开始吐青，工厂正门两旁的两个花坛已经筑成。灯泡装配车间、瓦斯车间和玻璃车间雄伟的新厂房也已巍然地耸立起来。高大的烟囱正不分昼夜地喷吐着浓烟。
    人们把这个工厂叫做“妇女工厂”，因为这个工厂的主力军是女工们，她们用鲜血守卫了这个工厂，又用劳动恢复和重建了它。去年十一月五日这里就响起了开始生产的第一声汽笛。开工的第二天，她们就展开了增产竞赛运动。个人竞赛、班竞赛和车间竞赛都热烈地展开。不久以后，中国人民支援朝鲜建设的新机器运到了这里，更加鼓舞了工人们的劳动热情。在开始用新机器工作的头十天里，她们就把生产量提高到百分之一百零六，在第二个十天中又提高到百分之一百一十三，并且提高了质量。
