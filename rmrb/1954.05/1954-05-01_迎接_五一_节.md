Welcoming the "May Day" Festival
Kim Jik-hyun, Member of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Labor Hero of Korea

I am welcoming this year's "May Day" festival amidst the affection of my Chinese friends. As I welcome this great festival of the international working class, I recall the times I spent celebrating "May Day" at the Aoji Coal Mine in Korea in the past.

I can vividly recall the workers' strike in 1932 against the Japanese invaders' reduction of daily wages from 4.5 jiao to 1.5 jiao, and the incident in the summer of 1939 when 43 coal miners drowned due to rainwater entering the pit, along with the angry protests and demonstrations of the workers.

But all these days of abuse, oppression, and suffering are now in the past.

After the liberation on August 15, 1945, our mine restored the tunnels destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and the average monthly coal production exceeded the quota by 158 percent. As the masters of production, we welcomed the first "May Day" after liberation with tremendous production achievements.

The "May Day" festivals we celebrated amidst the flames of the anti-aggression war and those hard yet glorious days of struggle are even more unforgettable.

In September 1952, more than 40 American planes bombed our mine, destroying the dormitories and comfortable rest rooms that the Party and the government had newly built for us after liberation. Due to the barbaric bombing of the American aggressors, the large factories, mines, and even small ironworks that our workers had rebuilt with their blood and sweat after liberation were severely damaged. However, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, the workers overcame all difficulties in underground factories, in damp, dark, and suffocating tunnels with constant power outages, and persisted in their work to ensure wartime production.

Today, our motherland is embarking on a great reconstruction effort on the ruins of war. Our workers are responding to the call of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, "Everything for the recovery and development of the national economy after the war!" and are standing at the forefront of all awakened people, striving to rebuild our motherland. The chimneys of many factories are smoking again. In many waterlogged tunnels of our mine, drainage work immediately began, and black coal was extracted again.

Although we now feel inadequate in terms of materials, machinery, and technology, the workers of our country, who have undergone severe trials in the flames of war, have the firm determination and strength to overcome all difficulties.

The enormous assistance and support from the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries has further strengthened our confidence. The Chinese People's Volunteers not only assisted us during the war but also did their best to help us during the recovery and construction period. The Korean people regard them as their dearest friends.

After our visit to many cities and factories in China this time, we learned from tens of thousands of Chinese worker brothers that they will work even harder to support Korea's post-war reconstruction. At the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, we saw the slogan "Support the Korean People with Practical Actions" posted on the wall, and we witnessed the workers' production efforts with our own eyes. During our visit to the Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Manufacturing Factory, Technician Chang Qing told me: "I was very happy when I heard the news that you were coming here. To welcome your arrival, I completed the work for March in 26 days." There were many such instances during our visit. From these facts, it can be seen how diligently the Chinese workers are striving to gain time in the struggle to build a socialist society. They are working selflessly to overfulfill their tasks and improve the quality of their products.

I met many labor models in various factories and also saw the products they created with their own hands. They are all learning advanced Soviet technology and displaying patriotic creative spirit, transforming old factories and old machinery.

After this visit, I have realized even more profoundly that Chinese workers have truly become the masters of their own country. They cherish machines as they cherish their own bodies, and they always try their best to improve their work in order to produce more and better machines and goods to meet the needs of the people.

Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese workers have combined their wisdom, strength, and activities with the realization of the general task of the country during the transition period. For example, Comrade Wang Fuchen of the Tianjin No. 2 State Cotton Mill said: "The general line is our lighthouse and our hope. This lamp was lit by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Not only workers, but also farmers, women, and youth across the country recognize this. After we return to our motherland, we must convey all our observations about great China to the people.

Korean workers and Chinese workers have established internationalist friendship and solidarity in the fierce struggle against the enemy. This friendship and solidarity is even stronger today, in the struggle for the socialist construction of the Chinese people and the post-war recovery and construction of the Korean people. No imperialist aggression can defeat the power generated by this friendship and solidarity.

### 迎接“五一”节

    迎接“五一”节
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员  朝鲜劳动英雄  金直铉
    我在中国朋友们的热爱中迎接着今年“五一”节。在迎接这个国际工人阶级的伟大节日的时候，我就回想起过去在朝鲜阿吾地煤矿迎接“五一”节的情形。
    一九三二年，我们工人反对日寇将每天四角五分的工资降为一角五分的罢工运动，一九三九年夏天由于坑里进入雨水而溺死四十三名采煤工人的事件，和愤怒的工人们抗议示威的景象，都一件件地重新浮现在我的眼前。
    但是，这一切虐待、压迫和痛苦的日子，都已经成为过去了。
    一九四五年八月十五日解放以后，我们的矿山恢复了被日寇所破坏的坑道，采煤的每月平均量超过了定额的百分之一百五十八。成为生产主人的我们，用巨大的生产成就来迎接了解放以后的第一个“五一”节。
    我们在反侵略战争的火焰中迎接的“五一”节和那些艰苦而又光荣的斗争的日子，更是令人难忘。
    一九五二年九月，四十多架美国飞机轰炸了我们的矿山，把解放后党和政府为我们新修起来的宿舍和舒适的休息室都炸毁了。由于美国侵略者的野蛮轰炸，我们工人在解放后用血汗重新修建起来的大工厂、矿山以至小型的铁工场都遭到了严重的破坏。但是，在朝鲜劳动党和我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，工人们在地下工厂中，在潮湿、阴暗、呼吸困难、不断停电的坑道里克服一切困难而坚持着工作，保证了战时生产。
    今天，我们的祖国在战争的废墟上正展开着伟大的重建工作。我们工人响应着敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的“一切为了战后人民经济的恢复和发展！”的号召，站在觉悟了的全体人民的最前列，为重建祖国而努力奋斗。许多工厂的烟囱重新冒出了黑烟。在积满污水的我们矿山的许多坑道里，立刻展开了排水的工作，重新采掘出黑的煤块。
    虽然现在我们无论在资材、器械和技术等各方面都感到不足，但是在战火中经历过严重考验的我国工人，有着克服一切困难的坚定决心和力量。
    苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家给我们的巨大援助和支持，更加加强了我们的信心。中国人民志愿军不仅在战争中援助了我们，而且在恢复建设时期也尽力地帮助我们。朝鲜人民都把他们作为自己最亲爱的朋友。
    这次我们访问了中国的许多城市和工厂以后，从成千成万个中国工人兄弟那儿知道，他们为了援助朝鲜的战后建设，将要更努力地工作。我们在太原钢铁厂看到了贴在墙上的“以实际行动来援助朝鲜人民”的口号，并且亲眼看到了工人们进行生产的情形。在参观张家口矿山机械制造工厂时，技工常清同志对我这样说：“我听到你们要到我们这里来的消息以后，感到很高兴，为了迎接你们的到来，我把三月份的工作在二十六天内就完成了。”这样的事实在我们的访问参观中是很多的。从这些事实中可以看出，中国工人们在建设社会主义社会的斗争中，是如何努力地在争取时间。他们为了超额完成自己的任务和提高产品的质量而忘我劳动着。
    我在各工厂中会见了许多劳动模范，也看见了他们亲手创造出来的产品。他们都在学习苏联的先进技术，并发挥着爱国主义的创造精神，改造了旧的工厂和旧的机械。
    在这次访问参观以后，我更加深刻地认识到，中国工人已真正成为自己国家的主人了。他们像爱护自己的身体一样爱护着机器，他们总是尽力改进工作，以便生产更多更好的机器和商品来满足人民的需要。
    在光荣的中国共产党和中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，中国工人已把自己的智慧、力量和活动都和争取国家过渡时期总任务的实现相结合起来了。例如，天津第二国棉厂的王富臣同志就这样说过：“总路线是我们的灯塔，也是我们的希望。这盏灯是共产党和毛主席点亮的。”不仅是工人，而且全国的农民、妇女和青年也都是这样认识的。我们回到祖国以后，一定要向人民传达我们对伟大中国的这一切见闻。
    朝鲜工人和中国工人在和敌人的激烈斗争中建立了国际主义的友谊团结。这种友谊和团结在今天，在为了中国人民的社会主义建设和朝鲜人民的战后恢复建设的斗争中更加坚强了。任何帝国主义的侵略势力都不能战胜这种友谊团结所产生的力量。（附图片）
