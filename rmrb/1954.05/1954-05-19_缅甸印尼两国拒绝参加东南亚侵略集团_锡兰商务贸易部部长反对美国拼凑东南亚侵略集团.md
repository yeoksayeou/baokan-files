    缅甸印尼两国拒绝参加东南亚侵略集团
    锡兰商务贸易部部长反对美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团
    【新华社十八日讯】据路透社消息，缅甸政府发言人十五日说，缅甸已告诉美国，它对任何拟议中的东南亚攻势联盟都不感兴趣。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社雅加达十七日讯：印尼报纸十七日刊载了情报部部长杜斌的一篇声明。他宣称，印尼希望尽可能迅速地解决印度支那的冲突，并建立亚洲的持久和平。杜斌正式证实，印尼拒绝接受美国所策划的关于在东南亚建立军事集团的计划。
    【新华社新德里十八日电】锡兰商务贸易部部长鲁·格·斯·沈纳那亚克十六日在科伦坡发表声明，反对美国策划中的东南亚侵略集团。他并指出，美国正在以美元“援助”对亚洲国家施加压力，以使这些国家受它的摆布。
    沈纳那亚克说：“大家都知道，美国现在不顾日内瓦会议最后可能作出的决议，不顾东南亚总理会议的公报，甚至不顾（英国）联邦一致的舆论，建议研究东南亚防务计划。
      “如果必要的话，它并将直接和这个地区的个别国家打交道。目前，它正在为了这个目的，在援外法案名义下，动用十一亿三千三百万美元。”
    他并指出，自从美国副总统尼克松不久以前到东南亚地区活动以后，锡兰就曾经多次接到邀请和别人愿对它提供“援助”的表示，这些邀请和表示的目的都是想使锡兰受到约束。
