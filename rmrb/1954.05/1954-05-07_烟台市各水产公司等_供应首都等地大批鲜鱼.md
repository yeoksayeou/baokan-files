    Currently, it is the peak season for fresh fish production in the Yantai fishing grounds of Shandong Province. Workers from the Yantai City Aquatic Product Companies and nearby fishermen are chasing after schools of fish day and night on the sea, catching fresh fish. Recently, the amount of fresh fish entering the market in Yantai City has been increasing daily. On April 17th alone, over 1,090,000 catties of fresh fish were transported into the city. The Yantai City Aquatic Product Companies and the Changshan Island Fishery Cooperative United Society, among other relevant departments, are purchasing large quantities of fresh fish, processing and icing them, and then quickly transporting them to the capital and other cities and industrial and mining areas throughout the country. Shipments of fresh fish to Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, Jinan, Dezhou, Tai'an, and other places have already begun. In order to allow people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, Xikang, and other provinces to also enjoy seafood, Yantai's relevant departments have processed a large quantity of shrimp meat, which is now being transported to the aforementioned areas.
