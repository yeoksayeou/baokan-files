Anhui Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Actively Supply Pig Feed to Farmers

Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Anhui Province are actively supplying pig feed to help farmers develop pig-raising as a sideline. According to statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives of five cities in the province and the supply and wholesale stations affiliated with the Provincial Cooperative Federation, more than 26 million jin of rice bran and wheat bran were supplied to farmers in the first quarter. If each pig eats 1.5 jin of rice bran and wheat bran per day, these feeds can feed more than 580,000 pigs for a month.

After the supply and marketing cooperatives strengthened the supply of feed, the activities of illegal private merchants speculating in rice bran and wheat bran were hit. For example, the state-owned grain company in Hefei City sold rice bran for 50,000 yuan per 100 jin. In the past, private merchants bought it from the grain company and sold it to farmers for 65,000 yuan per 100 jin. Now this phenomenon has been reduced. Farmers are very satisfied with the large supply of feed from the cooperative. Yu Chenghong, a farmer from Zhangwa Township in the suburbs of Hefei City, said: "The cooperative is really thoughtful. It tries to solve any difficulties we have."

    安徽省各地供销合作社
    积极供应农民养猪饲料
    安徽省各地供销合作社积极供应喂猪饲料，帮助农民发展养猪副业。据该省五个市的供销合作社和省合作总社所属的供应批发站的统计，第一季度供应给农民米糠、麸皮二千六百多万斤。如以每头猪一天食用一斤半米糠和麸皮计算，这些饲料可供五十八万多头猪吃一个月。
    供销合作社加强了饲料供应工作以后，不法私商进行米糠、麸皮投机的活动受到了打击。如合肥市国营粮食公司卖出的米糠每百斤五万元，过去私商从粮食公司买出来，转手卖给农民，每百斤就要卖六万五千元；现在这种现象已经减少。农民对合作社大量供应饲料非常满意。合肥市郊区张洼乡农民余成宏说：“合作社想的真周到，我们有什么困难，它都想法给我们解决。”
