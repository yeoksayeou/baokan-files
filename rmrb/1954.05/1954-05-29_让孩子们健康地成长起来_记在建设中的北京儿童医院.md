Letting Children Grow Up Healthy
　　——A Record of the Beijing Children's Hospital Under Construction
　　By our reporter Chen Weiren

    Going west from Tiananmen along West Chang'an Street, past Fuxingmen, a wide asphalt road leads to the new urban area. Not far from the city, on the north side of the road, stands a tall water tower. This is the Beijing Children's Hospital under construction.

    Here, tall buildings have risen from the ground. On the construction site of the Children's Hospital, more than a thousand construction workers are working enthusiastically. Most of the hospital wards have been completed; the external construction of the outpatient building, medical administration department, and isolation wards has also been basically completed. It is expected to officially open this autumn.

    This is currently the largest children's hospital in our country, with a total of six hundred beds, which is more than six times the total number of beds in the current Beijing First and Second Children's Hospitals. The entire hospital covers an area of approximately 75,000 square meters, with a total construction area of more than 31,000 square meters. The state's investment in the construction of this hospital amounts to 70 billion yuan; the cost of medical equipment will also be nearly 10 billion yuan. It fully embodies the Party and the People's Government's care for the next generation of the motherland.

    The main buildings of the hospital are a five-story outpatient building (including the basement) and two four-story ward buildings. The auxiliary buildings include a water tower, dormitory, morgue, etc. The main building's outpatient building, which can accommodate 1,000 visits per day, is divided into pediatric internal medicine, pediatric surgery, otolaryngology, and stomatology departments. The wards are divided into general wards and isolation wards. The medical supply section, in addition to the laboratory, operating room, and X-ray department, also has a pharmacy. Its scale is very large, with a general pharmaceutical room, tableting room, distillation room, high-pressure sterilization room (divided into sterile and non-sterile sterilization sections), washing room, cold storage, heating room, injection solution room, oxygen storage, and central pharmacy station.

    In the hospital's construction and layout, both the patients and the convenience of work have been taken into consideration. Therefore, the architectural design of the main building adopts a more dispersed hybrid style. The medical supply department is located between the outpatient building and the general ward, serving as the central part of the entire hospital. The isolation ward for infectious diseases is located on the north side, while the general ward is on the south side. This avoids the interference caused by the excessive concentration of wards and medical supply departments. At the same time, the connection between various departments is extremely convenient, and general patients and infectious disease patients will not infect each other. Whether it is the admission office, the outpatient department, or the wards, there are pre-diagnosis facilities. As soon as a patient enters, they must undergo an initial diagnosis. If an infectious disease is discovered, the patient can be sent directly to the infectious disease ward. Observation wards are also set up in the infectious disease ward and the general ward. Children with signs of infectious diseases temporarily stay there and are sent to the isolation ward or the general ward after a confirmed diagnosis. For the convenience of treatment and care, the general ward is divided into an infant section, a toddler section, and a children's section according to the children's age (the infant section has two premature infant rooms with special equipment, where the temperature, humidity, light, and air circulation will be adjusted by machines). The specifications of the wards in each section are generally the same. The colors of the walls, doors, and windows vary according to the age of the children: the infant section adopts a deeper sky blue, which gives people a quiet feeling; the toddler section and the children's section are light yellow, giving people a light and cheerful feeling. Artists are now designing beautiful murals for the children's section wards. The children's section and the toddler section also have spacious game rooms where children with minor illnesses can do appropriate games every day. The hospital's medical equipment is very complete. Currently, most of the important equipment has been purchased, including the latest physiotherapy equipment, as well as an iron lung for emergency treatment of polio patients.

    The wards also have a children's nutrition department: a milk preparation room and a meal preparation room (both with refrigeration and disinfection equipment).

    The hospital has a special "mother's room." If the hospital deems it necessary for some breastfeeding mothers to stay and take care of their children, they can stay there. There is a bedroom, bathroom, toilet, reading room, and specially assigned personnel to guide and care for the mothers. In addition, there is also a spacious lounge in the hospital for parents to rest. Mothers can see all the activities of their children through the specially made glass windows of the ward while standing on the corridor of the ward, but the children cannot see their mothers standing outside. In this way, the children will not cry due to emotional agitation, which affects their health.

    Whether it is a general ward or an isolation ward, they are organized into complete units, each unit having 30 beds. The general ward is divided into fifteen units, and the isolation ward is divided into five units, mostly facing south, with plenty of sunlight and air, and bright light. Each unit consists of four large rooms (each with about six beds) and three small rooms (each with two beds), forming a "concave" shape, separated from each other by glass windows. In the morning, soft sunlight shines through the glass, making the children lying in bed feel warm and comfortable. The head nurse's desk is conveniently placed in the middle of the "concave" shape, where she can see the movements of all the patients in the unit and provide timely care.

    On the south side of the general ward (i.e., the southernmost end of the hospital), a wide open space has been set aside as a green area. Here, flower beds and lawns will be arranged, and fruit trees will be planted. Currently, some peach trees have already been transplanted here.

    The front of the hospital is close to the moat. In the future, after the water of the Yongding River is diverted here, children can see a magnificent ancient city with a sparkling moat and sailing boats coming and going in the river from the windows of the ward.

    This modern hospital is not only a medical institution but also a school for training pediatricians. The hospital is equipped with some necessary teaching facilities for medical students to practice. On the third floor of the hospital's central building, there is a classroom that can accommodate 300 students; each ward also has a demonstration classroom, which can also be used for student practice. In the near future, a children's health research institution will also be established nearby.

    The children of New China are happy. Under the care of the Party and the People's Government, they will grow up healthily. (Attached picture)

    让孩子们健康地成长起来
    ——记在建设中的北京儿童医院
  　本报记者　陈维仁
    从天安门沿着西长安街西行出复兴门，一条宽敞的柏油马路通向新市区。在离城不远的路北，矗立着一座高高的水塔。这里便是在建设中的北京市儿童医院。
    在这儿，一幢幢高大的楼房已从平地升起，在儿童医院的工地上，一千多个建筑工人正在热情地劳动。医院的大部分病房已经完工；门诊大楼、医疗行政部门和隔离病房的外部工程，也基本上完成了。预计今年秋天可以正式开幕。
         这是目前我国规模最大的儿童医院，共有六百张病床，相当于目前北京市第一、第二儿童医院病床数总和的六倍以上。全院共占地约七万五千平方公尺，总建筑面积为三万一千多平方公尺。国家为修建这所医院的投资达七百亿元；医疗设备的费用，也将近一百亿元。它充分体现了党和人民政府对祖国下一代的关怀。
    医院的主要建筑是五层大楼的门诊楼一幢（连地下室）、四层的病房楼两幢，附属建筑有水塔、宿舍、太平间等。主楼中每日能容一千人次的门诊大楼，分设小儿内科、小儿外科、五官科和口腔科；病房分普通病房和隔离病房两部分；医疗供应部分，除化验部、手术部、爱克斯光部之外，还有药局，它的规模很大，里边有普通制药室、压片室、蒸馏室、高压消毒室（内分有菌和无菌消毒两部分）、洗涤室、冷藏室、加热室、注射液室、氧气库及中心药站等。
    在医院的建筑和布置等方面，既考虑到病人，又照顾到工作的便利。因此，主楼的建筑设计采用较分散的混合式。医疗供应部门位于门诊大楼和普通病房之间，为全院的中心部分；传染病的隔离病房横在北面，而普通病房则靠南。这样就可以避免由于病房和医疗供应部门的过分集中而引起的干扰；同时，各部门在工作的联系上也极为方便；普通病患者与传染病患者也不致互相传染。无论是入院处、门诊部和病房，都有预诊设施，病人一进门就必须经过初诊，如发现有传染性疾病，就可把病人直接送往传染病房。在传染病房和普通病房中还设有观察病房，有传染病征候的病儿都暂时住在里面，经诊断确定后再分别送入隔离病房或普通病房。为了治疗和护理上的方便，普通病房按孩子的年龄分成婴儿部、幼儿部和儿童部（婴儿部设有两间早产婴病室，里面有着特殊的装置，屋内的温度、湿度、光线、空气流通将利用机器来调节）。各部病房的规格大体上是一致的，墙壁门窗的颜色，根据儿童的年龄而有所不同：婴儿部采取浓度较深的天蓝色，它给予人以一种恬静的感觉；幼儿部和儿童部为浅黄色，给人以轻快之感。现在，艺术家们正在为儿童部病房设计美丽的壁画。儿童部和幼儿部还设有宽敞的游戏室，轻病的儿童每天可以在这儿做适当的游戏。医院的医疗设备是很完善的。现在，大部分重要器材都已购置齐备，其中除有最新式的理疗设备外，还有铁肺一具，供小儿麻痹症患者急救之用。
    病房中还有儿童营养部：配奶室、配餐室（都有冷藏消毒设备）。
    医院特设有“母亲室”。有些哺乳的母亲，医院方面如果认为有必要留下来照顾孩子，可以住在里面。这里有卧室、沐浴室、卫生间、阅览室，还有专人负责指导和照顾母亲们。此外，院内还有宽敞的休息室，专供家长休息；母亲们只要站在病房的走廊上，透过病房特制的玻璃窗，就可以看到自己孩子的全部活动，而孩子却看不到站在外边的母亲。这样，孩子就不致因情绪激动而啼哭，影响健康。
    无论是普通病房或隔离病房，都组织成为完整的单元，每个单元有病床三十张。普通病房共分十五个单元，隔离病房分为五个单元，多是坐北朝南，室内的阳光、空气都极为充足，光线明朗。每单元的四个大房间（每间约有六张床）三个小房间（每间有二张床）组成一个“凹”字形，彼此用玻璃窗间隔起来，一到早晨，柔和的阳光透过玻璃射进来，使躺在病床上的孩子们感到温暖和舒适。护士长的办公桌恰好置于“凹”字当中，在这里她就可以环视本单元全部病儿的动静，并及时进行护理。
    在普通病房的南面（即医院的最南端），辟出了一片宽阔的空地，作为绿化区。这里将布置上花坛、草地，种上果树。现在，一部分桃树已经移植进来了。
    医院的正面紧临着护城河，将来永定河的水引到这里以后，孩子们可以从病室的窗口里看到壮丽的古城下一道碧波荡漾的护城河，以及河中往来的船帆。
    这所现代化的医院，不仅是一个医疗机关，而且是一所培养儿科大夫的学校。医院内附有一些必要的教学设备，可以供医学院校学生实习之用。在医院中心大楼的三层楼上，有一间可供三百人上课的教室；在每个病房内还有示教室，也可供学生实习之用。在不久的将来，附近还要建立起儿童保健研究机构。
    新中国的儿童是幸福的，他们将在党和人民政府的爱护下，健康地成长起来。（附图片）
