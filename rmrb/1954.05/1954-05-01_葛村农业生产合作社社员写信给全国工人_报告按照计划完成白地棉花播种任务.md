Ge Village Agricultural Production Cooperative Members Write to National Workers
Reporting Completion of White Land Cotton Sowing Task According to Plan

To the Worker Comrades of the Whole Country:

    The May Day holiday has arrived again, our working people's holiday has arrived. We report to you that we have completed this year's white land cotton sowing task according to the planned area and time. Before sowing, we formulated our planting plan in accordance with the spirit of the national plan to comprehensively increase the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops. Currently, we have more than 1,250 mu of land with wheat growing in our cooperative. Since the beginning of spring, we have watered it once and weeded it three times. We are now watering it for the second time to ensure an average yield of 224 jin of wheat per mu, which is 21 jin higher than the average yield per mu in the whole village last year. There are more than 1,400 mu of white land that did not have crops growing on it before spring sowing. According to the plan, we will appropriately expand the cotton fields and plant more than 770 mu of cotton on the white land; we didn’t grow peanuts here in the past, but this year we plan to plant more than 50 mu; we will also plant 100 mu of sesame; and the remaining more than 400 mu will be planted with millet. After the white land is planted, we also plan to plant more than 400 mu of wheat stubble cotton, more than 200 mu of wheat stubble millet, 100 mu of wheat stubble sweet potatoes, and more than 300 mu of wheat stubble beans. The average yield per mu of white land and wheat stubble cotton will be increased to more than 162 jin, which is more than 47 jin more than the average yield per mu in the whole village last year. The unit area yield of millet will also be greatly increased. This year, we will produce more than 280,000 jin of wheat, more than 261,000 jin of millet, more than 193,000 jin of cotton, more than 16,000 jin of peanuts, and more than 6,000 jin of sesame. In addition to our own consumption and seed retention, the remainder will be sold to the state to support industrial construction.

    This year, our cotton sowing area has been expanded, and we completed the white land sowing work 20 days earlier than last year, shortening it by 10 days compared to last year. The most important reason why we can smoothly adapt to the needs of the country to expand cotton fields this year and quickly complete sowing according to the plan is that we have established a relatively large agricultural production cooperative under the leadership of the Communist Party. Out of the 238 households in our village, 208 have joined the cooperative. With everyone joining the cooperative, the land is used uniformly, and we plant whatever is suitable, which has many benefits. The land in the southeast and southwest of our village is suitable for growing cotton; but in the past, each household planted a lot of millet because they needed to eat it; now, planting more cotton here can increase the yield. When the cotton fields are connected into large areas, it naturally saves labor. For drought-resistant planting of cotton, it is necessary to draw water, carry water, irrigate the land, dig pits, sow seeds, and rake it flat, which requires many people to work together; in the past, not to mention when working individually, even in mutual aid groups, it was felt that labor could not be allocated, and we couldn't take care of accumulating fertilizer when taking care of weeding wheat, and we couldn't take care of irrigating wheat when taking care of planting flowers. This year, with the establishment of the cooperative, labor and waterwheels can be uniformly allocated, and each team competes to move forward; in the past, we were too busy to eat, but this year there is not enough work to do, and it was planted in ten days; and advanced technologies such as seed soaking, seed mixing, and close planting were adopted to ensure full seedlings.

    We can smoothly do the sowing work because of your help. There are now ninety-six waterwheels in our cooperative, all of which you manufactured. Without waterwheels, it would be impossible to plant more than seven qing of cotton in ten days. Without the pesticides you made, it would take a lot of effort to protect the seedlings. We can rest assured to grow cotton because the food supply is guaranteed. Our village is near the railway, and we see trains going south and north every day. A section of the train is loaded with grain, which requires a lot of mules and manual handling. Rice is transported from Sichuan, sorghum is transported from Northeast China, and corn is transported from Shanxi; grain from thousands of miles away can be adjusted, all thanks to you for building railways and making trains.

    This year during the Spring Festival, railway workers came to have a get-together with us. After we established the big cooperative, many workers from various places wrote to us, and we have not replied yet, which is very wrong. In the future, we will have more contact with worker comrades. We thought about it again and again for this letter for the "May Day" holiday, and we didn't know who to write to. We thank the workers who make trains, drive trains, and make waterwheels, but trains and waterwheels cannot be separated from steel, and we also thank the comrades who make steel; making iron and steel, and driving trains cannot be separated from coal, and we also thank the workers in the coal mines. We also thank those comrades who work hard to find minerals in the mountains. Now we are here holding a meeting to discuss writing a letter to you, using kerosene lamps with glass covers; now every household in our family uses kerosene lamps, and many families have glass embedded in their windows, which is convenient, economical, and bright; this must also thank the comrades in the oil mines and glass factories. There are too many worker comrades to thank, and we can't finish saying them. We have to write a letter to the worker comrades of the whole country.

    Our cooperative members are actively producing according to the plan! There is a mound in the north of our village, which everyone used to call the "feng shui" of the village. They said there was a "fairy cave" on it and they didn't dare to move it. It was full of rotten grass; this year we have broken this superstitious saying and scraped the grass; the grass on this mound alone has been used to compost more than sixty carts of fertilizer. We know that the country has difficulty in supplying fine fertilizer, and we must accumulate more fertilizer. Each mu of paddy field used to have two carts of manure last year, but this year it can have three to four carts. There are nine wells that do not have waterwheels yet, and we are going to set up waterwheels. It is not enough to plant cotton, but also to complete the production increase plan. Female cooperative members will take on the work of thinning seedlings, pruning, and picking flowers to ensure that they do well. Production teams and production teams, cooperative members and cooperative members, must carry out competitions to see who does well! We must also ensure that the cooperative is consolidated and learn your collectivity and move step by step towards complete collectivization. We love socialism, not just empty talk, but we must work harder to support industrial construction. We have already signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to pre-sell more than 6,000 jin of wheat; the contract for selling cotton has also been signed. We plan to plant 100 mu of sweet potatoes this year, just to save more fine grains to support you. We have already raised more than 100 pigs, and we plan to add another six or seventy according to the plan; on the one hand, for accumulating fertilizer, and on the other hand, for supplying you with meat. Cooperative members know that pig bristles can be exchanged for tractors, and the enthusiasm for raising pigs is even greater. We know that if a little bit of the plan is not realized, it will hinder the construction of socialism. We also hope that you will complete the national plan well. Steel workers, make more steel, we are eager to use tractors! Textile workers, rest assured to increase production, we will definitely produce more raw materials for you. But you must also know that growing cotton is not easy, and we hope you will find more ways to save raw materials and weave more, better, and cheaper fabrics.

    You and we are already connected, and we will be more connected in the future. Let's communicate more in the future!

    葛村农业生产合作社社员写信给全国工人
    报告按照计划完成白地棉花播种任务全国的工人同志们：
      “五一”节又到来了，咱们劳动人民的节日到来了。我们向你们报告，我们已经按计划规定的面积和时间，完成了今年的白地棉花播种任务。在播种以前，我们按照国家计划全面增产粮食、棉花、油料的精神，订出了我们的种植计划。现在我们社里还长着麦子的地是一千二百五十多亩，开春以来我们已经浇了一水，锄了三遍，现在正在浇第二水，要保证每亩平均产小麦二百二十四斤，比去年全村每亩平均产量提高二十一斤。春季播种以前没有长着庄稼的白地是一千四百多亩。按照计划，适当扩大棉田，要在白地上种七百七十多亩棉花；过去我们这里不种花生，今年计划种五十多亩；还要种一百亩芝麻；余下的四百多亩种谷子。白地种完以后，我们还计划种麦茬棉花四百多亩，麦茬谷子二百多亩，麦茬红薯一百亩，麦茬豆子三百多亩。白地和麦茬棉花的平均产量，每亩要提高到一百六十二斤多，比去年全村的平均每亩产量多四十七斤多。谷子的单位面积产量也要大大提高。今年全年，我们要生产出二十八万多斤麦子，二十六万一千多斤谷子，十九万三千多斤棉花，一万六千多斤花生，六千多斤芝麻来；除了我们自己吃用和留种以外，余下的要全部卖给国家，支援工业建设。
    今年我们的棉花播种面积扩大了，也比去年提早二十来天做完了白地播种工作，比去年缩短了十来天。今年我们能够顺利地适应国家的需要扩大棉田，能够很快地按照计划的规定完成播种，最重要的原因就是我们在共产党的领导下成立了一个比较大的农业生产合作社。我们全村二百三十八户，已经有二百零八户入社了。大家入了社，土地统一使用，适合种啥就种啥，这样的好处很多。我们村东南和西南的地适合种棉花；可是过去各户因为需要吃小米，种了不少谷子；现在在这里多种棉花，就能提高产量了。棉花地连成了大片，种起来也自然就省工了。抗旱点种棉花，要汲水，要挑水，要浇地，要刨坑，要撒籽，要耙平，需要很多人一齐干；往年，不要说单干的时候了，就是在互助组里，也觉得劳力调配不过来，顾积肥顾不了锄麦，顾浇麦顾不了种花。今年成立了社，劳力和水车都能统一调配了，各个队都比赛着往前干；往年忙得吃不住，今年有活不够做，十来天就种好了；并且都采用了浸种、拌种、密植的先进技术，保证全苗。
    我们能顺利地做好播种工作，也是因为有你们的帮助。我们社里现在有九十六辆水车，这都是你们制造的。要是没有水车，这七顷多棉花要在十天种好，真是连想也不敢想。要是没有你们造出来的治虫药，要想保苗，也就要费大劲了。我们能安心种棉花，也因为粮食供应有了保证。我们村子就靠着铁路，我们每天看见火车往南往北开，一节车装的粮食，就得用很多骡子和人工搬运，从四川运来了大米，东北运来了高粱，山西运来了玉米；几千几百里开外的粮食都能调剂，全靠你们修了铁路和造了火车。
    今年春节，有铁路工人来和我们联欢。我们成立大社以后，有很多地方的工人给我们来信，我们都还没有回信，这很不对。以后我们要和工人同志们多多联系。“五一”节这封信，我们想来想去，不知道写给谁好。我们感谢造火车、开火车、造水车的工人同志们，可是火车、水车又都离不开钢铁，我们也感谢炼钢炼铁的同志们，炼铁炼钢开火车都离不开煤，我们也感谢煤矿上的工人们。我们也感谢那些辛辛苦苦地在山里找矿的同志们。现在我们在这里开会商量给你们写信，用着玻璃罩子的煤油灯；现在我们家家户户都用煤油灯了，很多家窗子上都嵌着玻璃，又方便又省钱又亮堂；这又得感谢油矿和玻璃厂的同志们，要感谢的工人同志太多了，说也说不完。我们只好写信给全国的工人同志们。
    我们社员们按计划生产，都积极着哩！我们村北有个土岗，过去大家说是村里的“风水”。说上边有“神仙洞”，不敢动，上面满是烂草；今年我们已经打破了这种迷信说法，把草刮了；光这一个土岗上的草，就沤成了六十多车肥料。我们知道国家供应细肥困难，我们要多多积肥。每亩水地，去年上两车粪，今年可以上三车到四车。有九个井还没水车，我们要置起水车来。棉花光种上还不行，还要完成增产计划。女社员们要把间苗、整枝打杈、摘花的活包下来，保证做好。生产队和生产队，社员和社员，都要开展竞赛，看谁干得好！我们还要保证把社巩固好，学习你们的集体性，一步步走向完全集体化。我们热爱社会主义，不光说空话，要下更大劲来支援工业建设。我们已经和供销合作社订了合同，预售了六千多斤小麦；卖棉花的合同也订好了。我们今年要种一百亩红薯，就是打算更多节省下细粮来支援你们。我们已经养了一百多只猪，按计划还要再添六七十只；一方面为了积肥，一方面也为了供给你们吃肉。社员们知道猪鬃能换拖拉机，养猪的劲头更大了。我们知道，计划有一点实现不了，都会妨碍建设社会主义。我们也希望你们好好完成国家计划。钢铁工人们多多造出钢铁来吧，我们急着使拖拉机哩！纺织工人们，放心增产吧，我们一定好好地给你们增产原料。你们可也要知道，种棉花也不容易哩，希望你们多想办法节省原料，织出更多更好更便宜的布匹来。
    你们和我们已经连成一气了，今后还要更连气。我们以后多通信吧！
