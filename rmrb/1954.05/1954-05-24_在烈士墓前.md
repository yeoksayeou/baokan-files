    At the Martyrs' Cemetery
    Qian Qu

    On the morning of May 4th, the mountains of Shuocang-ri, Seongcheon County, Korea, were shrouded in morning mist, and the cemetery of martyr Luo Shengjiao was still silent. At this time, the railways, highways, and footpaths leading to Shuocang-ri from all directions were already bustling. Young soldiers from the Chinese People's Volunteers rushed to the cemetery of martyr Luo Shengjiao to spend their historically significant holiday here. Among these young people, the representatives of the unit where Luo Shengjiao served before his death were particularly noteworthy. Cherishing the memory of their close comrade-in-arms, they came from the coastal defense front hundreds of miles away to visit the tomb. Everywhere, one could hear their songs of remembrance and praise:

    You were born on the banks of the Zishui River in the motherland,
    And rest in peace by the nameless river in Korea.
    To save the Korean brother who fell into the icy river,
    You generously gave your precious life.
    Dear comrade-in-arms Luo Shengjiao,
    You will always live in our hearts.

    A grand memorial meeting began, and the father and mother of Choi ?, who were working in the fields, also participated in the memorial ceremony. They walked along the cobblestone path to the monument and offered the wreaths they had made by hand and the bouquets of flowers they had picked from afar to their respected martyr. In an instant, the area around the monument was piled with lilac and camellia flowers, emitting a fragrant aroma. What they offered was not just wreaths and bouquets, nor just respect and mourning, but also the achievements they had gained from studying the spirit of the martyr, and the determination to inherit and carry forward the martyr's legacy.

    Look at the unit where martyr Luo Shengjiao served before his death! This is not only a heroic unit that annihilated more than 43,000 enemies in famous battles such as Tiande Mountain and "Baldy Mountain," but also an internationalist army that loves the Korean people as much as it loves its own people. Since entering Korea, they have helped the Korean people cultivate 20,000 mu of land, transplant rice seedlings on 60,000 mu, harvest more than 2 million mu in the autumn, transport more than 2.6 million dan of manure, build more than 400 houses and school buildings, and build 16 large and small dams, including the famous "China-Korea Friendship Dam" and "Combat Friendship Dam." They also repaired the "Jianlong Reservoir," the largest irrigation facility in northern Korea that was destroyed by American imperialism, repaired more than 400 kilometers of large and small roads, and saved 350,000 jin of grain to relieve Korean disaster victims. Now, they are preparing to build several giant dams for the Korean people. Last September, Xie Peiyan and Guo Fangyin, young members of the Communist Youth League, and 12 other heroes bravely rescued a drowning Korean woman in the Anrong River estuary despite the turbulent sea. They are still praised by the local people as "living Luo Shengjiaos." Luo Shengjiao's heroic image also inspires the Korean people. Since the beginning of spring, people from all over have been coming to pay their respects to martyr Luo Shengjiao. The people of Shuocang-ri have recently planted flowers on "Luo Shengjiao Mountain," wanting to make this originally flowerless mountain forever bloom with the flowers of internationalism. The Luo Shengjiao Production Brigade is working actively, helping the families of soldiers with manure and planting, and has been playing a pioneering role in production, making Shuocang-ri's spring plowing production the third best in the whole county. The students of the Luo Shengjiao class have recently been receiving letters from Choi ?, who is visiting China, and from young Chinese friends. Their academic performance has also improved significantly, and the students have all expressed that they "will definitely learn the internationalist spirit of Brother Shengjiao, study hard, and prepare to become the most loyal soldiers in defending the motherland and peace in the future."

    After Xiao Yuxin, Luo Shengjiao's close comrade-in-arms, spoke, Choi ?'s father also excitedly walked to the monument. With tears of excitement and gratitude, he said: "The Korean people will never forget the kindness of Luo Shengjiao and the Chinese people. Although I am old now, I become young, strong, and powerful whenever I think of Luo Shengjiao. I will work hard in production and educate Choi ? to become a person who is useful to the country and to peace, to repay Luo Shengjiao, to repay the heroic People's Volunteers, and to repay the great Chinese people."

    When the afterglow of the setting sun gilded the Luo Shengjiao Martyr's Monument and Memorial Pavilion with a golden hue, the soldiers, who had spent a memorable day in this memorable place, left the martyr's cemetery with reluctance.

    在烈士墓前
    前驱
    五月四日的清晨，朝雾笼罩着朝鲜成川郡朔仓里的群山，罗盛教烈士的墓地还是一片寂静。这时，从四面八方通往朔仓里的铁路、公路和人行小道上，已经喧闹起来。志愿军中的青年战士们纷纷赶到罗盛教烈士的墓地来了，他们要到这里来度过富有历史意义的自己的节日。在这些青年当中，特别引人注意的是罗盛教烈士生前所在部队的代表，他们怀念着自己的亲密战友，从百里外的海防前线赶来谒墓。随处都可以听到他们怀念与颂扬的歌声：
    你生长在祖国的资水江畔，
    安息在朝鲜的无名河边。
    为了救活掉进冰河的朝鲜兄弟，
    你把宝贵的生命慷慨捐献。
    亲密的战友罗盛教，
    你永远活在我们心间。
    一个盛大的纪念会开始了，正在地里劳动的崔?的父亲和母亲也参加了纪念仪式。他们沿着鹅卵石铺砌的小道，走到纪念碑前，将亲手扎制的花圈，将远方采来的花束，献给自己敬爱的烈士。霎时间，纪念碑的四周被紫丁香花和山茶花堆满了，散发着阵阵的清香。他们献上的决不仅仅是花圈和花束，也决不仅仅是崇敬和悼念，他们同时也献上了学习烈士精神获得的成就，献上了继承和发扬烈士遗志的决心。
    看看罗盛教烈士生前所在的部队吧！这既是一支曾在天德山、“老秃山”等著名战斗中歼敌四万三千多人的英雄部队，又是一支像热爱祖国人民一样地热爱朝鲜人民的国际主义军队。入朝以来，他们曾帮助朝鲜人民耕地两万亩，插秧六万亩，秋收二百余万亩，送粪二百六十余万担，修建房屋和校舍四百余所，修建著名的“中朝友谊坝”、“战斗友谊坝”等大小水坝十六座，修复了被美帝国主义破坏的朝鲜北部最大的灌溉设施“见龙贮水池”，修补了大小公路长达四百余公里，并节约了三十五万斤粮食，救济了朝鲜灾民。现在，他们又正在准备为朝鲜人民修建几个巨型水坝。去年九月，在安戎江口冒着汹涌澎湃的海潮，奋勇救出溺水的朝鲜妇女的青年团员谢培彦、郭芳银等十四勇士，至今仍被当地人民传颂为“活的罗盛教”。罗盛教的英雄形象也同样鼓舞着朝鲜人民。入春以来，就不断有人从远近各地前来凭吊罗盛教烈士。朔仓里的人民新近又在“罗盛教山”上栽了花，他们要使这座原来无花的山永远吐放着国际主义的花朵。罗盛教生产突击队，正在积极劳动，帮助军属送粪播种，在生产上一直起着先锋作用，使朔仓里的春耕生产成为全郡第三。罗盛教班的同学们最近不断收到访问中国的崔?同学的来信，还有中国青年朋友们的来信，他们的学习成绩也有显著提高，同学们都表示“一定学习盛教哥哥的国际主义精神，努力学习，准备将来当一个保卫祖国与和平的最忠实的战士。”
    在罗盛教的亲密战友肖玉新讲话以后，崔?的父亲也激动地走到纪念碑前，他含着兴奋和感激的眼泪说：“我们朝鲜人民永远也忘不了罗盛教和中国人民的恩情，现在我虽然老了，但一想到罗盛教我就变得年轻健壮而有力量，我一定要努力生产，并将崔?教育成对祖国对和平有用的人，来报答罗盛教，报答英雄的志愿军和伟大的中国人民。”
    当夕阳的余辉给罗盛教烈士纪念碑和纪念亭镀上一片金黄色的时候，在这个值得纪念的地方度过了值得纪念的一天的战士们，才怀着恋恋不舍的心情离开了烈士的墓地。
