    Commemorating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Publication of Lenin's "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back"
    "Pravda" Publishes Article "The Victory of Lenin's Organizational Principles"
    Soviet newspapers commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Lenin's "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back." Pravda published an article by Gidarenko on the 20th entitled "The Victory of Lenin's Organizational Principles."

    The article states: Lenin laid the organizational foundation of a revolutionary Marxist party in this work. Lenin developed Marx's and Engels' basic arguments about the proletarian party, and for the first time in the history of Marxism, established the theory of the party, that the party is the leading organization of the proletariat, the basic weapon in the hands of the proletariat, without which it is impossible to achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is impossible to build socialism and communism. The great Lenin taught that the party is the advanced, conscious contingent of the working class, armed with revolutionary theory. The party is an organized contingent, the highest form of class organization of the proletariat. It has the mission of leading the activities of all other organizations of the working class ideologically and organizationally. The party is a united organization, a whole, with a unified will, and unites various ideas into a unified torrent of practical action in its work. Lenin demanded that the title and role of party members be continuously improved, and that a true fighting alliance of communist idealists be established.

    The article states: Lenin formulated various standards for party life and various principles for party leadership in "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," party discipline that all party members must strictly abide by in order to maintain party unity; it emphasized that democratic centralism must be thoroughly implemented, the enthusiasm of party members and the masses must be vigorously developed, party life issues must be collectively discussed, and criticism of shortcomings and mistakes in party work must be boldly carried out. The article states: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has grown into an invincible force because the party has always unswervingly taken Lenin's organizational principles as its guide, always cherished the purity of its ranks, consolidated the unity of its ranks, and ruthlessly crushed opportunists, splitters, and organizational saboteurs. The article states: Lenin profoundly summarized the new experiences of the proletarian revolutionary struggle and continuously developed and enriched his theory about the party. Lenin paid particular attention to further consolidating the party when it became the ruling and leading force in the system of the dictatorship of the working class. The resolution on party unity made by the Tenth Party Congress based on Lenin's report pointed out that not allowing factional activities and maintaining party unity are the basic conditions for the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The article states: Now that building a communist society has become the actual task of the Soviet people, the party attaches great importance to further improving organizational work, and improving the role and responsibility of every communist party member and every party organization. The party constitution adopted by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the embodiment of Lenin's organizational principles and Lenin's standards of party life. The article also expounded Lenin's organizational principles of selecting cadres according to political and professional qualities, developing inner-party democracy, implementing collective leadership and opposing personality cults, etc. (Our correspondent in Moscow, Li He)

    纪念列宁著作“进一步，退两步”发表五十周年
    “真理报”发表论文“列宁组织原则的胜利”
    苏联各报纪念列宁著作“进一步，退两步”发表五十周年。真理报在二十日发表吉达伦科的论文“列宁组织原则的胜利”。
    论文说：列宁在这个著作中奠定了革命的马克思主义政党的组织基础。列宁发展了马克思、恩格斯关于无产阶级政党的基本论点，在马克思主义史上首次确立了关于党的学说，关于党是无产阶级的领导组织、是无产阶级手中的基本武器，没有它就不可能取得无产阶级专政，就不可能建设社会主义和共产主义。伟大的列宁教导说：党是工人阶级的先进的、觉悟的、以革命理论武装起来的队伍。党是有组织的队伍，是无产阶级最高形式的阶级组织。它负有使命在思想和组织上领导工人阶级其他一切组织的活动，党是团结一致的组织，是一个整体，具有统一的意志，在自己工作中把各种意念联合在实际行动的统一潮流中。列宁要求不断提高党员的称号和作用，建立共产主义共同理想者的真正战斗的联盟。
    论文说：列宁在“进一步，退两步”中制订了党的生活的各项标准，党的领导的各项原则，所有党员要严格遵守的为保持党的统一所必需的党的纪律；它强调民主集中制要彻底实行，党员群众积极性要极力发展，党的生活问题要集体讨论，对党的工作中缺点和错误的批评要勇敢地展开。论文说：苏联共产党成长为不可战胜的力量，因为党始终不变地以列宁的组织原则为领导，向来爱护自己队伍的纯洁和巩固自己队伍的统一，无情地粉碎机会主义分子、分裂分子和破坏组织分子。论文说：列宁深刻地总结无产阶级革命斗争的新经验，不断发展和丰富了自己关于党的学说。列宁特别多地注意当党成为在工人阶级专政的制度中的执政的、领导的力量的时候进一步巩固党的问题。党第十次代表大会在根据列宁的报告所作的关于党内统一的决议中指出：不允许派别活动和保持党的统一，是无产阶级专政胜利的基本条件。论文说：现在当建设共产主义社会成为苏联人民的实际任务的时候，党非常重视进一步改善组织工作，提高每个共产党员、每个党组织的作用和责任。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所通过的党章，就是列宁的组织原则，列宁的党的生活标准的体现。论文中并阐述了按照政治和业务品质选择干部、发展党内民主，实行集体领导反对个人崇拜等等列宁的组织原则。（本报驻莫斯科记者  李何）
