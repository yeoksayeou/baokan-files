Shaanxi Province Achieves Success in Preventing Rice Bug Damage
Gansu and Ningxia Provinces Deploy Prevention Work

    The wheat rice bug infestation in over forty counties (cities) of Shaanxi Province has been brought under control thanks to the attention of Party and government at all levels, early deployment, and the active prevention efforts of the masses. Most wheat fields have not been damaged, and only a small portion of wheat fields where prevention was delayed have suffered minor damage. A bumper wheat harvest is expected across the province. This year, after the widespread dissemination of the General Line, the enthusiasm for production among the broad masses of farmers has generally increased. Cadres at all levels have also paid attention to wheat field management. Following the eradication of wheat spider damage, a large-scale campaign to prevent rice bug infestations has been launched. According to statistics from Baoji Prefecture's eleven counties alone, more than 3,500 cadres at all levels participated in the prevention work. According to statistics from nineteen counties (cities), over 100,000 people participated in the prevention efforts, using more than 8,500 pieces of insect control equipment. The masses also combined chemical and mechanical prevention with artificial net-pulling methods, and created various insect control devices such as "airplane-style" dusting machines. After eradicating the rice bug infestation, many areas held seminars or on-site observation meetings to study the achievements and experiences in overcoming the pest damage.

    During this year's farmer's rice bug prevention campaign, they received strong support from the workers. Factories supplied farmers with over 1,300 tons of "666" insecticide powder and 3,000 bolts of gauze. The amount of insecticide powder increased by more than thirteen times compared to last year, and the price of the insecticide was reduced by half compared to last year. Most of this insecticide and equipment were distributed to farmers through supply and marketing cooperatives before or just as the rice bugs emerged from the soil. As a result, many farmers personally wrote letters to the workers of the Shaanxi Provincial Pesticide Factory, thanking the worker comrades for their support.

    Following Shaanxi Province's launch of a campaign to prevent wheat rice bug infestation, the Gansu and Ningxia Provincial Departments of Agriculture and Forestry also promptly deployed prevention work, calling on leaders at all levels in winter wheat areas and relevant departments such as agricultural technology extension stations to carry out mass prevention work through mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

    陕西省防治吸浆虫工作得到成绩
    甘肃宁夏两省布置防治虫害工作
      陕西省四十余县（市）的小麦吸浆虫害，由于各级党、政重视，及早布置和广大群众积极防治，截至五月中旬，已被扑灭。大部分麦田没有受到损害，小部分防治较晚的麦田也仅受到轻微损害，全省小麦丰收有望。今年广大农民经过总路线宣传后，生产积极性普遍提高，各级干部也重视了麦田管理，继扑灭麦蜘蛛危害之后，又掀起了大规模的防治吸浆虫运动，仅据宝鸡专区十一个县统计，参加防治工作的各级干部达三千五百多人，据十九个县（市）统计，参加防治的群众达十万余人，使用防虫工具八千五百多件。群众还结合药械防治，发挥了人工拉网防治的作用，创造了“飞机式”撒粉器等各式防虫器械；在扑灭吸浆虫害后，许多地区的农民并举行了座谈会或观摩会，研究了战胜虫害的成果和经验。
    今年农民防治吸浆虫害运动中，得到了工人的大力支援，工厂供给各地农民的“六六六”药粉达一千三百余吨，纱布三千匹。药粉比去年增加十三倍多，药价比去年降低一半。这批药械大部分在吸浆虫出土前或刚出土时，就通过各地供销社供应到农民手里。因此，有许多农民亲自给陕西省农药厂工人写信，感谢工人老大哥对他们的支援。

    继陕西省展开防治小麦吸浆虫害运动后，甘肃、宁夏两省农林厅亦先后及早布置防治小麦虫害工作，号召冬麦地区各级领导及农业技术推广站等有关部门，通过互助合作组织，展开群众性的防治工作。
