According to incomplete statistics, the four sub-groups in the First General Sub-Group alone held more than 1,100 comfort meetings, symposiums, report meetings, and visits during the two months of the comfort activities, directly meeting with more than one million People's Liberation Army troops and local people. In his report, Yan Qingti also focused on the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army in safeguarding the motherland and building the motherland over the past few years, as well as the new atmosphere of socialist construction in the great motherland. He said: This comfort activity has not only deepened the profound friendship between the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army, these two brotherly forces, but also enabled us to further understand the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland over the past few years. The achievements and contributions of the People's Liberation Army have given us great encouragement and education. In the future, the Volunteer Army will redouble its efforts to continue to humbly learn from the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army in hard work, heroic sacrifice, and unity with the masses, learn from the experience of the People's Liberation Army in regularization and modernization, and at the same time continue to deeply study the general line and conscientiously implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, so as to repay the support and concern of the people of the motherland and the People's Liberation Army with practical actions to defend the motherland and defend peace.
