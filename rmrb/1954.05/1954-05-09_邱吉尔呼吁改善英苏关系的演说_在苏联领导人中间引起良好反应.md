Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 8th: TASS reports from Moscow that Soviet newspapers have published news of British Prime Minister Churchill's speech at the annual meeting of the Conservative Party organization "Primrose League." In his speech, Prime Minister Churchill called for improving relations between Britain and the Soviet Union and establishing contact in a spirit of sincerity.

TASS has learned that the British Prime Minister's speech has evoked a positive response among Soviet leaders. In this regard, attention is drawn to the fact that the Soviet government has consistently striven to improve relations and cooperate with all countries, provided that these countries also have this desire. Soviet leaders believe that the improvement of relations and the development of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union are not only beneficial to both countries but also to all other countries concerned with maintaining and consolidating international peace, especially European countries.

More and more political figures in the majority of countries around the world are recognizing the need to expand cooperation and mutually beneficial economic relations between countries and are expressing their support, even if these countries belong to different social systems. Only the ruling groups of individual countries disagree with this approach in international affairs and treat it with hostility because they are pursuing aggressive goals and putting selfish interests above the interests of peace and human prosperity.

    邱吉尔呼吁改善英苏关系的演说
    在苏联领导人中间引起良好反应
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：苏联各报刊载了英国首相邱吉尔先生在保守党组织“普林罗斯同盟”的年会上发表演说的消息，邱吉尔首相在年会上呼吁改善英国和苏联的关系，并以诚恳的精神建立联系。
    塔斯社获悉，英国首相的演说在苏联领导人中间引起良好的反应。在这方面大家注意的是，苏联政府始终不渝地争取改善和所有国家的关系并和它们进行合作，只要这些国家也有这种愿望。苏联领导人相信，英国和苏联两国之间关系的改善和合作的发展，不仅有利于两国，而且有利于关心维护和巩固国际和平的一切其他国家、首先是欧洲国家。
    世界大多数国家的政界人士，愈来愈多地认识到必须扩大各国之间的合作和互利的经济关系并表示支持，即使这些国家属于不同的社会制度。只有个别国家的统治集团不赞同在国际事务中采取这种方针，并用敌意的态度来对待它，因为他们追逐的是侵略目的，并把自私自利的利益放在和平和人类繁荣的利益之上。
