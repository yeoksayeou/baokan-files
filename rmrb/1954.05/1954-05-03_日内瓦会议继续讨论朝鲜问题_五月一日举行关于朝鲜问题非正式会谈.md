Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 30th. The Geneva Conference continued at 3:00 PM this afternoon, chaired by the head of the Soviet delegation and Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov.

Speaking at today's meeting were Turkish representative Asikalim and Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon. Their speeches (including translation time) lasted a total of 30 minutes and contained nothing new. Asikalim completely repeated Dulles's views, falsely accusing the Korean people's self-defense war against the Lee Seung-man clique and the American aggressors as "aggression." He described the Turkish government's dispatch of troops to distant Korea to serve as cannon fodder for the United States as being for the cause of so-called "collective security." He opposed the reasonable suggestions put forward by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. He advocated that, according to the illegal resolution on the Korean question passed by the United Nations on October 7, 1950, the "United Nations," one of the belligerent parties in Korea, should continue to complete the tasks that it had failed to accomplish with military force.

Like the Turkish representative, the speech of the Thai representative, Prince Wan Waithayakon, contained nothing new. He merely repeated the hackneyed tune of so-called "communist aggression," attempting to shift the responsibility for the aggression against Korea onto the United States. Prince Wan Waithayakon boasted that Thailand's "independence" was due to its adherence to the "open door" policy and granting "equal opportunities" to all powers. Everyone knows that the so-called "open door" and "equal opportunities" are precisely the slogans used by the United States to invade Asia for nearly a century. Prince Wan Waithayakon also echoed the views of the United States, advocating that, according to the illegal United Nations resolution of October 1950, the South Korean regime should be expanded to North Korea under the guise of the United Nations.

After the Thai representative finished speaking, no one requested to speak today. The Philippine representative, who had originally registered to speak, withdrew his request. Chairman Molotov announced that, according to the agreement, the meeting would be adjourned until May 3. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 1st. From 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM today, a general informal meeting on the Korean question was held here at the League of Nations Building. The foreign ministers and their assistants from the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of China, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, the United States, the Republic of Korea, and France participated in the meeting.

    日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
    五月一日举行关于朝鲜问题非正式会谈
    【新华社日内瓦三十日电】日内瓦会议于三十日下午三时继续举行，由苏联代表团首席代表、苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫担任主席。
    在今天会议上发言的有土耳其代表阿西卡林和泰国代表旺亲王，前后发言时间（连同翻译时间在内）共三十分钟，都没有什么新的内容。阿西卡林完全重复杜勒斯的意见，把朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团和美国进犯者的自卫战争诬蔑为“侵略”。他把土耳其政府派遣军队到遥远的朝鲜去为美国充当炮灰，说成是为了什么“集体安全”的事业。他反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议。他主张根据联合国在一九五零年十月七日通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案，让朝鲜交战一方的“联合国”去继续完成它没有能够用军事力量完成的任务。
    和土耳其代表一样，泰国代表旺亲王的发言没有什么新的东西。他只是重复所谓“共产党侵略”的滥调，企图替美国转嫁侵略朝鲜的责任。旺亲王吹嘘泰国的“独立”是由于奉行向一切列强“开放门户”和给予“均等机会”的结果。大家知道，所谓“门户开放”和“机会均等”正是近百年来美国用来侵略亚洲的口号。旺亲王还附和美国的意见，主张依据一九五零年十月联合国的非法决议，在联合国名义的掩饰下把南朝鲜政权扩大到北朝鲜。
    在泰国代表发言完毕以后，没有人要求在今天发言。原来报名要求发言的菲律宾代表撤回了他的要求。主席莫洛托夫宣布，根据协议，会议休会到五月三日举行。会议于下午三时三十分休会。
    【新华社日内瓦一日电】今天下午三时三十分至六时，在此间国联大厦举行了一个关于朝鲜问题的一般的非正式的会谈。参加会谈的有英国、苏联、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、美国、大韩民国、法国等国家的外交部长及其助理人员。
