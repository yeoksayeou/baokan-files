Saving Materials is the Main Way to Reduce Engineering Costs
Ruan Huanzhong, Director of the Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel

    Material costs account for a very large proportion of the basic construction building and installation costs. In the past two years, the material costs in Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction accounted for about 65% of the total building and installation investment. Therefore, correctly organizing material supply and using materials economically are the main measures to reduce engineering costs. In order to achieve the state's task of reducing construction and installation costs this year, the materials department bears a particularly important responsibility.
    Based on our experience in organizing technical supply over the past two years, saving materials can be approached from the following aspects:
    I. Master quotas, supervise material usage, and reduce material consumption: The current quota material requisition card implemented in basic construction is an effective method to supervise material consumption, prevent waste, and reduce losses. With quotas, construction departments can clearly save raw materials. Workers have a clear understanding during construction, knowing that exceeding the quota is waste and reducing the quota is saving. Therefore, they actively tap potential and reduce consumption. The finance and supply departments can also easily supervise and inspect based on this. From past construction experience, waste is significant. For example, some work areas actually consumed 55% more cement than the quota, which is completely avoidable. Another example is that the loss rate of steel is stipulated to be 5%, while the actual rate is 10%. If this can be reduced by 1%, more than 1 billion yuan can be saved. Conversely, the Electrical Installation Engineering Company laid cables, shortened distances as much as possible, measured the length in advance, and calculated accurately, reducing short ends and saving 60,000 meters of cable, worth more than 5 billion yuan.
    II. Rationally and effectively use materials: On the premise of not affecting the quality of the project, try to replace expensive materials with cheaper materials, and use substandard materials for secondary or temporary projects as much as possible. This is of great significance for reducing costs. For example, in civil engineering projects, vigorously promote the use of various grades of mixed cement. Under possible conditions, replace high-grade cement with low-grade cement. On average, each ton can reduce costs by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. If civil engineering bricklaying and plastering projects do not use cement but use white ash and sand, a large amount of cement can be saved and costs can be reduced. In water supply projects, use cement adhesive instead of lead at pipe joints. Saving one kilogram of lead can save 20,000 yuan. The example of the civil engineering company using 400-grade cement instead of lead in 1953, saving 30 tons of lead, is a case in point. If fully implemented in 1954, a lot can be saved. Another example is wood. This year, the total value of wood planned to be used by Anshan Iron and Steel accounts for about 16.3% of the total material cost, and there has been significant waste in wood in the past. This year, we must follow the instructions of the State Council, adhere to the principle of thrift, and strive for economic rationality. Grasp the nature of the project and try to replace superior materials with inferior materials. For example, the value of hardwood and Korean pine differs by 300,000 yuan per cubic meter. If 10,000 cubic meters of Korean pine can be replaced with hardwood throughout the year, 3 billion yuan can be saved. Hardwood, after drying, can be used not only for floor joists, formwork, and supports, but also for floors and doors and windows. The idea of fearing trouble and not wanting to use it must be overcome. Another example is the uprights of the wood transport vehicles. If they are handled carefully during unloading to avoid damage and then distributed to various units for use, they are worth more than 200 million yuan.
    III. Recycle and revitalize waste and old equipment: Anshan Iron and Steel has many reconstruction and expansion projects, and the amount of dismantled old equipment is extremely large. In 1953, the amount of dismantled old steel reached 19,000 tons. After testing, some of these steels can be used in formal projects with slight repairs, or even without processing. Many old tools and residual materials can be recycled and revitalized, or even used without repair. In 1953, the old product department of the Materials Department issued more than 19,000 pieces of plumbing and heating materials. Another example is that the lubricating oil used for cleaning machines can be revitalized and reused after filtration and sedimentation. In 1953, Comrade He Yongde of Work Area 5 of the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company created an oil filter, which saved the country 11,100 kilograms of cleaning oil in two and a half months. Fully using the residual edges and short ends of various materials is also a way to reduce costs. For example, the short ends cut from round steel for making steel bars can be recycled and used to process rivets and hacksaws. In 1953, the short-end loss rate in Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction decreased from 4% to 1.6%, but the short ends were not utilized. If 100 tons can be recovered in 1954, 600 million yuan can be saved. Another example is the gaskets for pipes. In 1953, 200 tons were cut from whole steel plates. If the edges of the steel plates can be utilized, 60% of the steel plate can be saved. The parts, formwork, scattered wood, and small boards dismantled by various construction departments can be used to make small layered dish racks, rice boxes, and wall cabinets without having to cut long materials short again. The Civil Engineering Construction Company used 3,000 cubic meters of scattered short materials in this way in 1953, saving 3 billion yuan. If 90% of cement bags can be recycled in 1954, 1 billion yuan can also be saved. Other materials such as asbestos ash bags and wire wrapping cloth for insulation wrapping, and old wire for weaving baskets can all achieve the purpose of saving.
    IV. Increase the turnover rate of tools: Construction scaffolds, planks, and formwork account for 37% of the total amount of wood required. If the turnover rate can be increased and losses reduced, the savings will be significant. If the advanced Soviet experience of using scaffolds can be adopted, the turnover rate can be increased to 30 times, which can reduce losses, save a lot, and make installation convenient, disassembly flexible, and ensure safety. It is stipulated that external scaffolds should only be turned over ten times. It is stipulated that the formwork should be turned over nine times. If oil is applied to the inside of the formwork and the design is meticulous, one more turnover can save 3.6 billion yuan. For other temporary construction materials such as wires and various metal tools, the date and turnover rate should be specified to ensure savings.
    V. Save material transportation costs: In 1953, material transportation costs accounted for 10.8% of the material cost, and small on-site handling was not included. In 1953, the overspending on transportation costs was significant. For example, bulk materials were sent to the construction site, but far from the construction site, some were even placed on the foundation, and multiple handling during construction not only increased material consumption but also increased material costs. Some four-ton trucks were loaded with less than two tons. The ways to reduce transportation costs are as follows: First, shorten the transportation distance, understand in advance, grasp the source of goods, and buy from nearby places instead of going to distant places, overcoming opposite transportation and material travel. Second, the trucks are fully loaded and do not run empty. Material requisition must be contacted in advance, and the tonnage of materials must be determined according to the truck's carrying capacity to improve transportation efficiency and increase the number of trips. Third, minimize small handling as much as possible. Bulk materials are generally sent directly to the construction site. Before sending directly to the construction site, the material stacking site must be determined according to the construction plan, and the establishment of supply stations by region should be promoted to facilitate one-time transportation. Fourth, send whole vehicles if possible, and do not send less-than-truckload shipments. Do not use trucks if less-than-truckload shipments can be sent.
    VI. Improve warehouse management and reduce material losses: In the past, due to poor warehouse management, the amount of inventory shortage and surplus was very large; the lack of technical measures for storage caused serious deterioration losses. In 1953, 7,000 kilograms of lead oil alone was left in the open air due to unsealed or unused barrels. According to incomplete statistics, 600 rolls of asphalt felt paper were melted and deteriorated due to being placed flat and subjected to pressure. This year, we should implement the advanced Soviet material balance accounting method, conduct regular inventory, regular inspection, and quantitative distribution, overcome inventory surplus and shortage, and strengthen technical storage and technical quality inspection to prevent deterioration due to poor storage. A sound receipt and dispatch system should be established in the warehouse. The date of delivery and arrival time, and storage period should be noted on the card for each material, and the system of first come, first served should be followed.
    VII. Strengthen the leadership of procurement work, strictly review the contracts for processing and ordering, especially the contracts of private merchants. Before ordering, we must grasp the market price, accurately calculate the cost, and attach technical quality certificates for acceptance to ensure the quality of materials.
    VIII. Establish close contact with the design company in a timely manner, and provide information on inventory materials and cheap materials when determining the design, so as to make economic designs.
    In saving materials and reducing costs, we must never relax the guarantee of supply because of saving materials, nor can we affect the quality of the project because of saving and utilizing waste materials. Reducing costs must be completed on the premise of guaranteeing supply, especially guaranteeing the supply of key projects, and guaranteeing quality. But we should never use the excuse of affecting the quality of the project to ignore saving materials. Because saving materials and reducing costs is a huge and complex task, there must be a practical and feasible plan. Each unit should start by analyzing the waste that existed in the past and the possibility of saving, and formulate indicators for saving materials and reducing costs. This indicator should be promptly and specifically explained to the masses, so as to mobilize the masses to discuss and rely on the masses to discuss specific measures to complete this task, so that the cost reduction indicators are more in line with the actual situation, and ensure the realization of the cost reduction plan.

    节约材料是降低工程成本的主要方法
    鞍钢基本建设材料处处长　阮唤中
    材料费用在基本建设建筑安装费用中占极大的比重，过去两年来鞍钢基本建设中的材料费用占了建筑安装投资总数的百分之六十五左右。因此，正确地组织材料供应，节约地使用材料是降低工程成本的主要措施。为了实现今年国家规定的降低建筑安装成本的任务，材料部门肩负着特别重要的责任。
    根据两年来我们组织技术供应的体会，节约材料可以从下列各方面着手。
    一、掌握定额，监督材料使用，降低材料消耗：目前基本建设所推行之限额领料卡片是监督材料耗用，防止浪费，减少损耗的有效方法。有了限额，即可使施工部门明确地节省原材料，工人们在施工时，心中有了底，知道超过定额即浪费，降低定额即节约，因而积极挖掘潜力，降低消耗；财务与供应部门也便于据此监督检查。从过去施工情况看来，浪费是很大的。如有的工区使用水泥实耗较定额超过百分之五十五，这是完全可以节约的。又如钢材的损耗率按规定为百分之五，而实际则为百分之十，如降低百分之一，即可节约十余亿元。相反的如电气安装工程公司敷设之电缆，由于尽量缩短距离，事先量好长度精确计算，减少了短头，节约电缆达六万公尺，值五十余亿元。
    二、合理地有效地使用材料：在不影响工程质量的前提下，尽量以贱价材料代替高价材料，次要或临时工程尽量利用次料，这对于降低成本具有极大意义。例如在土建工程中，大力推广多种多标号混合水泥，在可能的条件下，以低标号水泥代替高标号水泥，每吨平均就可降低五万元到十万元。土建砌砖抹灰工程如不用水泥而采取白灰沙子，就可节约大量水泥而降低成本。上水道工程管道接头处，以水泥胶合物代铅，节约一公斤铅就可以节约二万元。一九五三年土建公司以四百号水泥代铅，节约了三十吨铅，就是例证。一九五四年如全部推行，可节约很多。再如木材，今年鞍钢计划用木材之总值为整个材料费的百分之十六点三左右，而过去在木材方面浪费是很大的。今年必须根据政务院的指示，本节约原则，力求经济合理的精神，掌握工程性质，尽量以次等材代替优等材，如硬杂木与红松每立方公尺价值相差三十万元。全年如能以硬杂木代替一万立方公尺的红松则可节约三十亿元。硬杂木经过干燥，不但可用在地楞子、盒子板支柱上，同样可用在地板和门窗上，那些怕麻烦不愿使用的思想必须克服。又如运木材之车立柱，如在卸车时仔细一些，不使损坏，然后发给各单位使用，即值二亿余元。
    三、回收，复活利用废旧器材：鞍钢改建、扩建工程很多，折除的旧器材，数量极为庞大。一九五三年拆除的旧钢材即达一万九千吨，这些钢材经过化验，有些稍加修理，甚至不加工即可用在正式工程上。许多旧工具、残料回收后经过加工复活甚至不加修理也还可以使用，一九五三年材料处旧品科回收科发出之水暖材料即达一万九千余件。再如清洗机械用润滑油经过过滤沉淀即可复活利用，一九五三年机械安装工程公司五工区何永德同志创造了滤油器，二个半月即为国家节约一万一千一百公斤洗油。充分使用各种材料的残边短头也是降低成本的途径，例如制作铁筋的元钢所切下的短头，如能回收利用，则可加工铆钉、扒锯子。一九五三年鞍钢基本建设中的短头耗损率虽由百分之四降低到百分之一点六，但短头并未利用，一九五四年如能回收一百吨，即可节约六亿元。又如管道用的垫板，一九五三年有二百吨，都是用整张钢板剪的，如能利用钢板边子，就可节省钢板百分之六十。各施工部门拆下之零件、盒子板、零星木头、小板可制作小层料碗架、米箱、壁橱，而不需另外再把长材截短。土木建筑工程公司一九五三年就这样使用了三千立方公尺零星短材，节省三十亿元。水泥袋一九五四年如能回收百分之九十，也可节省十亿元。其它如石棉灰袋子，电线包布做保温包布，旧铁丝编筐，都可以达到节约目的。
    四、提高工具使用的周转次数：施工用交手杆、跳板、模型板占需用木材总量的百分之三十七，如果能提高使用周转次数，减少损失，节约价值也很大。如能采用苏联先进经验里交手，周转次数可提高到三十次且可减少损耗，节约很多，且安装方便，拆卸灵活，同时可保障安全。使用外交手规定只周转十次。模板规定周转九次，如将模板内部涂油，周密设计，多周转一次，可节约三十六亿元。其它如临时工程用的电线、各种金属工具均应规定日期与周转次数来保证节约。
    五、节省材料运杂费：一九五三年材料运杂费占材料费百分之十点八，工地小搬运还没有计算在内。一九五三年在运杂费上超支是很大的，如大宗材料送往工地，但远离施工现场，有的甚至放在基础上，施工时多次搬运，不但增加材料耗损，而且提高材料成本。还有的四吨汽车其装载量不满两吨。降低运杂费的办法有以下几个方面：第一、缩短运输距离，事先了解，掌握货源，近地有的就不到远地去购，克服相向运输，材料旅行。第二、汽车满载，不空跑，领料必须事先联系好，根据汽车的载重量确定材料的吨位，提高运输效率，增加运输次数。第三、尽可能减少小搬运，大宗材料普遍采取直送工地，在直送工地之前必须根据施工平面图，确定材料堆积场所，推广按区域设立供应站，以便一次运输。第四、能发整车不发零担，能发零担不用汽车。
    六、改进仓库管理，降低材料耗损：过去因仓库管理不善，盘亏盘盈甚大；保管缺乏技术措施，造成严重变质损失，一九五三年仅铅油一项由于开桶未用或未用完而放置露天的即达七千公斤，据不完全统计，油毡纸平放受压，溶化变质达六百卷。今年应该执行苏联先进的材料余额核算办法，经常盘点，定期检查，定量发放，克服盘盈盘亏，加强技术保管与技术质量检查，使之不因保管不良而变质。在仓库内应健全收发制度，每种材料在卡片上注明出厂、到货时间，保管期限，掌握先来先发的制度。
    七、加强采购工作的领导，严格审核加工订货的合同，特别是私商的合同，在订货之前必须掌握市场价格，精确计算成本，验收时一律要附技术质量证明，保证材料质量。
    八、及时与设计公司取得密切联系，在确定设计时，提供库存材料与廉价材料的资料，以便作出经济的设计。
    在节约材料，降低成本中决不能因为要节约材料而放松了保证供应，也决不能因为节约利用废料而影响工程质量。降低成本必须在保证供应，特别是保证重点工程供应，保证质量的前提下来完成。但也决不应借口影响工程质量而忽视节约材料。由于节约材料降低成本是一项巨大与复杂的任务，必须要有切实可行的计划，各单位应从分析过去与目前存在的浪费与节约的可能性着手，制订节约材料，降低成本的指标。这个指标要及时地具体地向群众交底，从而发动群众来讨论，依靠群众讨论出完成这一任务的具体措施，使降低成本指标，更符合实际情况，保证降低成本计划的实现。
