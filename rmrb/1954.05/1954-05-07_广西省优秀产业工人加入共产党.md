Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th — Many excellent industrial workers in factories and mines in Guangxi Province have been admitted to the Chinese Communist Party. In 1953, the number of Communist Party members among industrial workers in various factories and mines increased more than threefold compared to June 1952. This year, on average, there is one Communist Party member for every eighteen industrial workers in the province.

Among these Communist Party members is Chen Zhaoyi, a veteran technician with twenty-seven years of experience at the Guoying Pinggui Mining Bureau Power Plant, well-known to the masses of workers in the province. He modified two boilers that had long been considered impossible to improve. After the modification, the power generated by the boilers increased by more than 4.92 million kilowatt-hours annually, saving 930 tons of coal, for a total annual increase in wealth for the state of 2.86 billion yuan. In the second half of last year, the power plant's No. 3 boiler was taken out of service due to severe corrosion of the boiler tubes. Chen Zhaoyi climbed into the boiler to carefully inspect the extent of the corrosion and, using simple electric welding, repaired the boiler, ensuring the successful completion of the bureau's 1953 production tasks. Recently, Chen Zhaoyi has been researching and creating an automatic coal crusher and a double-layer air supply method for the boiler, determined to dedicate all his wisdom to the country. Lu Da, a veteran technician at the Liuzhou Machinery Factory who recently joined the Party, during the trial production of gasoline engines at the machinery factory, some people, fearing difficulties, planned to send the complex carburetor to Shanghai for processing. However, Lu Da made a guarantee to the Party, volunteering to undertake the task of making the carburetor. Lu Da worked tirelessly, racking his brains for more than twenty days, and finally made the carburetor, completing the production task of trial-producing dozens of gasoline engines. Qi Jingqiu, a smelting technician at the Pinggui Mining Bureau, famous for improving working conditions and practicing thrift, researched the use of the "furnace hole water discharge method" to replace the arduous work of smelting workers under temperatures of over 1000 degrees for many years, increasing work efficiency by twenty-nine times and directly increasing the recovery rate of products, adding 3.4 billion yuan of wealth to the state in 1953 alone. Among these Communist Party members is also Tan Qing, a young matchbox-filling female worker, who has won the special-class competition red flag sixty-six times, becoming a respected figure among the workers at the Wuzhou Match Factory. Due to the exemplary actions of the worker Party members, forty-two advanced worker Party members in the province have been selected as provincial-level labor models, including Chen Zhaoyi and Lu Da, who were selected as special-class labor models in the province.

At present, the number of industrial workers in Guangxi Province has doubled compared to before liberation. With the development of the country's socialist industrialization, workers' awareness has further increased, and the number of advanced workers applying to join the Party is constantly increasing. The Party committees of various factories and mines attach great importance to strengthening the communist ideological education of Party members and the work of Party building, in order to strengthen the Party's ranks.

    广西省优秀产业工人加入共产党
    【新华社南宁六日电】广西省各工矿企业中很多优秀产业工人被吸收加入中国共产党。一九五三年各厂矿产业工人中的共产党员比一九五二年六月份增加三倍以上。今年全省平均每十八个产业工人中就有共产党员一人。
    在这些共产党员中，有为全省工人群众所熟悉的有二十七年工龄的国营平桂矿务局发电厂老技工陈兆毅，他曾改装两座长期被认为无法改进的锅炉。改装后，使锅炉发电量每年增加四百九十二万多度，节约用煤九百三十吨，总计每一年能给国家增产二十八亿六千多万元财富。去年下半年，电厂第三号锅炉因炉管腐蚀严重停止使用，陈兆毅就爬到锅炉里详细检查炉管腐蚀程度，结果用简单的电焊法便修好了这个锅炉，保证了全局一九五三年生产任务的胜利完成。最近陈兆毅又在研究创造自动碎煤机和锅炉双层送风法，决心把自己的全部智慧献给国家。新近入党的柳州机械厂老技工卢达，在机械厂试制汽油机中，有些人因怕困难，打算把机件复杂的化油机送往上海加工，但卢达却向党提出保证，自愿承担制作化油机的任务。卢达废寝忘食地苦思钻研了二十多天，终于制成了化油机，完成了试制几十台汽油机的生产任务。平桂矿务局里以改善劳动条件和勤俭节约著名的冶炼技工齐敬秋，曾研究用“炉孔放水法”代替了多年来冶炼工人在一千多度高温下的辛苦操作，使工作效率提高了二十九倍，并直接增加了产品的收回率，仅一九五三年就为国家增产了三十四亿元的财富。在这些共产党员中，还有年青的火柴装盒女工谭卿，她曾六十六次获得特等竞赛红旗，成为梧州火柴厂工人们敬爱的人物。由于工人党员的模范行动，全省有四十二名党员先进工作者被评选为省级劳动模范，其中陈兆毅、卢达两人被评选为全省特等劳动模范。
    目前，广西省产业工人已比解放前增加两倍。随着国家的社会主义工业化事业的发展，工人觉悟进一步提高，申请入党的先进工人不断增加。中共各厂矿党委都很重视加强党员的共产主义思想教育和建党工作，以壮大党的队伍。
