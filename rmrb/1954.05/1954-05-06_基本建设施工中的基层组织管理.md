Basic-level organizations in capital construction should first implement the one-leader system based on the principle of production area management. The leader of the basic-level organization – the foreman – should be the sole and fully empowered leader of the work section's construction. All construction instructions from the site director for the work section must be executed through the foreman. The foreman is fully responsible for all work in the work section and for the execution of orders from the site director. This principle of socialist enterprise management seems very clear; however, we still cannot correctly implement it in practice.

Before the first half of 1953, we had two different situations in the management of basic-level organizations. One was that under the leadership of the construction site engineering team leader, several work sections were established, and the work section director (i.e., the foreman) directly guided the workers in construction, being the sole and fully empowered leader of the work section's construction. This organization conformed to the organizational principle of the one-leader system. The other situation was that under the leadership of the site director, there were two parallel organizations managing construction separately. One was the work section director (i.e., the foreman), who was the direct organizer of basic-level construction and was directly responsible for construction progress, quality, conservation, and safety, as stipulated. However, the work section director only had engineering technicians and leading workers responsible for technical guidance, but no workers. It was a case of "officials without soldiers" and "having authority without power." Under the direct leadership of the site director, there were also several specialized engineering teams (such as earthwork engineering teams, concrete engineering teams, and steel bar formwork teams), responsible for managing and allocating workers for construction. However, these engineering teams had no fixed work sections, nor did they have engineering technicians to guide construction. Workers were transferred here and there according to the requirements of the work sections. The result was that the two parallel organizations could not manage each other. The work section director could not command the workers, and the engineering team leader had workers but did not manage the organization of construction. Administration and technology were separated, worker mobility was high, labor discipline was poor, and labor efficiency was very low. The fundamental reason was that the one-leader system was not implemented in the basic-level organization, but rather a "two-leader system" or "multi-headed system," which was actually a "no-one responsible system." In the responsibility system establishment campaign last June, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, this unreasonable organizational structure was changed, and the engineering teams were merged into the work section director's organization, and the worker teams were directly under the command of the work section director, combining administration and technology, and establishing the foundation for the one-leader system in the basic-level organization.

Secondly, the basic-level organization must implement the principle of worker stabilization and overcome worker mobility. The characteristic of capital construction is the frequent change of construction objects and construction areas. As each work section is completed, each individual project is completed, and even each work process is completed, workers must move to new work sections, new individual projects, and new work processes. This characteristic of frequent change easily leads to worker mobility, creating a phenomenon of no one being responsible. Therefore, correctly resolving the issue of worker stabilization in the basic-level organization is the foundation for establishing a basic-level administrative responsibility system. Achieving only a single leadership without implementing worker stabilization still makes it impossible to implement the one-leader system.

Experience over the past year has proven that, according to the nature of the construction section and the basic construction objects, basic workers should be fixed in the work section and become the foreman's fixed construction team, with workers always following the foreman. The so-called basic workers refer to the workers of all types of work needed for all construction processes in the basic project undertaken by the foreman. Those auxiliary workers who are frequently needed in the work section should also be fixed to the foreman and become members of his basic team; only those auxiliary workers who are temporarily needed to cooperate with construction should not be fixed to the foreman to avoid idling. They should be formed into a separate auxiliary foreman team, directly under the leadership of the construction site engineering team leader, and flexibly allocated according to the needs of each work section's project. When these workers come to the work section to cooperate with construction, they must absolutely obey the foreman's command. In addition, some special professional engineering teams, such as electrical adjustment teams and meter installation teams, should be directly under the leadership of the engineering company and assigned to the construction site according to project needs. During the construction period, they should be under the unified management of the person in charge of the construction site (the construction site engineering team leader) of this engineering company.

Under the leadership of the foreman, worker organizations can take two forms. One is a completely specialized construction organization; the other is a mixed construction organization based on basic types of work and including auxiliary types of work. There can also be two or one levels. In the two-level system, the foreman is above the team, and the team is above the worker group. Generally, the foreman directly leads the group.

Due to the variability of capital construction, worker transfers are still unavoidable with changes in construction objects, project scale, and technical conditions. However, worker transfers should be carried out according to the established structure, preferably according to the foreman's established structure, or the entire team or group should be transferred, and they should be returned to the original foreman's structure after the work is completed. In the past, we often disrupted the original structure when transferring workers, transferring them piecemeal, which encouraged worker mobility, which was very inappropriate.

The effect of implementing worker stabilization is obvious. First of all, it overcomes worker mobility, overcomes the problem of workers being transferred here and there, not listening to commands, lax labor discipline, and low labor efficiency. Secondly, it enhances workers' sense of responsibility and consolidates the responsibility system. With workers fixed, a "consistent responsibility system" is implemented (i.e., from the start of construction to completion and acceptance, the foreman and all the workers under his command are fully responsible), and the quality of the project is guaranteed. Furthermore, after workers are fixed, it is easier to mobilize workers to discuss plans, ensuring the organizational guarantee for the implementation of the policy of relying on the working class. Furthermore, after workers are fixed, the foreman is familiar with the workers, and the workers are familiar with each other, making it easier for the foreman to correctly assign workers' work, and the labor coordination between workers is also better, and construction experience can be accumulated.

The third main principle of basic-level organization management is the unification of administrative and technical leadership. Because the basic level is the unit that directly organizes construction, the foreman must directly organize and guide construction, and the unification of administrative and technical leadership is necessary to exert efficiency. It is impossible to manage administration and technology separately. For example, in the past, the foreman and the responsible technician had different responsibilities: the foreman was in charge of administration, and the technician was in charge of technology. As a result, neither of them managed well. After we established the foreman responsibility system last year, we implemented the principle of unified administrative and technical leadership, promoted old workers and young technicians to serve as foremen or assistants to the foreman – deputy foremen – and combined old workers and technicians. Doing so clarifies responsibilities, unifies authority, and combines labor and technology, which is very necessary for strengthening basic-level management work and cultivating cadres.

Work sections that implement a shift system should set up a deputy foreman or a technician on duty as an assistant to the foreman, but not as a separate level.

The fourth issue in basic-level organization management is the work section division method and the basic responsibilities of the foreman.

The division of work sections should be based on the principle of production area management, according to the characteristics of construction and the distribution of areas, dividing work sections for management. A work section includes a certain number of individual projects, all of which are uniformly managed and organized for construction by the foreman. Some people advocate dividing work sections according to the type of work, organizing many types of work foremen, such as masonry foremen and concrete foremen. The reason is that "workers can be absolutely fixed to the foreman" and "workers can follow the foreman." In reality, this type of foreman is just changing the name of the construction team leader or group leader. It is very obvious that a type of work foreman cannot assume the organizational and leadership responsibility for the construction of the entire project of a work section; he can only assume part of the work process and cannot assume the overall work. Organizing coordinated construction between various processes and types of work is not something he can assume. It is still necessary to have a work section foreman responsible for uniformly organizing and directing construction.

Our basic responsibilities of the foreman are stipulated as follows:

(1) Prepare the foreman's weekly and daily work plan, issue engineering task orders, explain construction tasks to the subordinate construction teams or groups, and mobilize workers to discuss the plan to ensure that the work plan is completed on time and evenly.

(2) Study design drawings and construction operation design drawings, explain construction drawings, operation drawings, technical conditions, operating methods, and expert suggestions to construction teams or groups, and ensure their strict implementation.

(3) Regularly guide construction on site and inspect the quality of the project. After the construction of the sub-projects is completed, check that the quality meets the design standards, sign the engineering task order, and handle the project handover acceptance.

(4) Obtain and issue materials according to the material quota, and supervise and ensure reasonable use to avoid waste.

(5) Regularly conduct safety technical education, implement safety technical regulations, and ensure the implementation of safety measures to ensure safe construction.

(6) Improve labor organization, promote advanced experience, implement the piece-rate wage system and the time-based bonus system, assess workers' work performance, and propose handling opinions on workers' wage grades and rewards and punishments to continuously consolidate labor discipline and improve labor productivity.

(7) Cooperate with the trade union to launch and organize labor competitions to ensure the timely and early completion of the construction plan.

    基本建设施工中的基层组织管理
    鞍山钢铁公司副经理　赵北克
    基本建设施工中的基层组织，首先应该根据生产区域管理制的原则，实行一长制。基层组织的领导人——工长，应是工段施工的唯一的、全权的领导者。工地主任对于工段内一切施工指示，都须通过工长来执行。工长对本工段的全部工作，对工地主任命令的执行，负完全责任。这一条社会主义企业的管理原则，看来是十分明确的；但我们在具体实践中仍然不能正确的执行。
    一九五三年上半年以前，我们在基层组织管理上，存在着两种不同的情况。一种是在工地工程队长领导下，设立几个工段，工段主任（即工长）直接指导工人施工，是工段施工的唯一的全权领导者，这种组织是符合于一长制的组织原则的。另外一种情形是在工地主任领导下，有两个平行的组织，分别管理施工。一个是工段主任（即工长），是基层施工的直接组织者，按规定他对施工进度、质量、节约、安全均负直接责任；但工段主任只有工程技术人员与领工员负责指导技术，此外没有一个工人。即“有官无兵”、“有职无权”。在工地主任直接领导下，还有几个专业工程队（如土方工程队、混凝土工程队、钢筋木模队等），负责管理与调配工人施工。但这些工程队没有固定的工段，也没有指导施工的工程技术人员。工人是根据工段的要求，调来调去，到处流动。执行的结果是：两个平行的组织，谁也管不了谁。工段主任指挥不动工人，工程队长有工人又不管组织施工。行政和技术脱节，工人流动性很大，劳动纪律不好，劳动效率很低。其根本原因就是在基层组织没有实行一长制，而是实行了“两长制”、或“多头制”，实际是“无人负责制”。去年六月建立责任制运动中，根据苏联专家建议，改变了这种不合理的组织机构，把工程队分别合并于工段主任，工人小队直接归工段主任指挥，行政与技术合一，建立了基层组织一长制的基础。
    其次，基层组织要实行工人固定化的原则，克服工人的流动性。基本建设施工的特点，就是施工对象，施工地区的经常变动。随着每一个工段施工完了，每一个单项工程施工完了，甚至每一个工序施工完了，工人都要随着转移到新的工段、新的单项工程与新的工序施工。这种经常变动的特点，极易产生工人的流动性，造成无人负责现象。因此，在基层组织中正确地解决工人固定化的问题，是建立基层行政责任制的基础。只做到单一领导，而未实行工人固定化，仍然是无法贯彻一长制的。
    一年来的经验证明，应该根据施工段的性质与基本施工对象，把基本工人固定于工段，成为工长的固定的施工队伍，工人始终跟着工长走。所谓基本工人是指工长所担负的基本工程中，全部施工工序所需要的工种的工人。凡工段经常需要的部分辅助工人，也应该固定于工长，成为其基本队伍的成员；只是临时需要配合施工的辅助工人，则不应固定于工长，以免窝工，而应单独成立辅助工长，归工地工程队长直接领导，根据各工段工程需要，灵活调配。这些工人到工段配合施工时，要绝对服从工长的指挥。除此以外，有些特殊的专业工程队，如电气调整队、计器安装队，则应归工程公司直接领导，根据工程需要分配到工地施工，在施工期间，归本工程公司的工地负责人（工地工程队长）统一管理。
    在工长领导下，工人组织可以有两种形式。一种是完全专业的施工组织；一种是以基本工种为主的、包括辅助工种的混合施工组织。其层次也可以有两级的或一级的。两级的，工长之下为小队，小队下为工人小组。一般的由工长直接领导小组。
    由于基本建设施工的变动性，随着施工对象、工程规模、技术条件的变化，工人调动还是不可避免的。但调动工人应该按建制，最好是按工长的建制调动，或整队整组调动，并在工作完成后，仍归还原工长建制。过去我们调动工人常常打乱原来建制，零星调动，助长了工人的流动性，这是很不妥当的。
    实行工人固定化，其效果很明显。首先是克服了工人的流动性，克服了工人调来调去，不听指挥，劳动纪律松懈，劳动效率不高的毛病。其次，提高了工人的责任感，巩固了责任制。工人固定了，实行了“一贯到底负责制”（即从开始施工到竣工验收，全部由工长及所属各组工人负责），工程质量得到了保证。再次，工人固定后便于发动工人讨论计划，使依靠工人阶级的方针的贯彻得到了组织上的保证。再次，工人固定后，工长熟悉工人，工人熟悉工人，工长就便于正确分配工人工作，工人之间劳动配合也好，并可以积累施工经验。
    基层组织管理的第三个主要原则就是行政领导与技术领导合一。因为基层是直接组织施工的单位，工长要直接组织与指导施工，必须行政领导与技术领导合一，才能发挥效能。把行政与技术分开来管是不可能的。如过去工长和主管技术员分工，工长管行政，技术员管技术，结果谁也管不好。我们在去年建立工长责任制后，即贯彻行政与技术统一的领导原则，提拔老工人和青年技术员担任工长或担任工长的助手——副工长，并把老工人与技术员配合起来。这样做，职责明确，事权统一，劳动与技术结合，对加强基层管理工作与培养干部都是非常必要的。
    实行轮班制的工段，应该设立值班的副工长或值班技术员作为工长的助手，但不是一级。
    基层组织管理的第四个问题，是工段划分方法与工长基本职责问题。
    工段的划分应该根据生产区域管理制的原则，按照施工的特征，根据区域的分布，划分工段进行管理。一个工段，包括一定数量的单项工程，全部由工长统一管理组织施工。有人主张按工种划分工段，组织许多工种工长，如瓦工工长、混凝土工长等。理由是“工人可以绝对固定归工长”“工人可以跟工长走”，实际上这种工长只不过是把施工小队长或组长变换名称而已。很明显的，工种工长是无法担负一个工段全部工程施工的组织与领导责任的，他只能担负一部分工序工作，并不能担负全盘工作。各个工序与工种之间组织协同施工，不是他所能担负的，仍然需要有工段工长负责统一组织与指挥施工。
    工长的基本职责我们规定如下：
    （1）编制工长逐周分日作业计划，签发工程任务单，向所属施工小队或组交代施工任务，并发动工人讨论计划，以保证作业计划按时地均衡地完成。
      （2）学习设计图纸与施工作业设计图，向施工小队或组讲解施工图、作业图、技术条件、操作法以及专家建议，并保证其严格执行。
      （3）经常在现场指导施工，检查工程质量。分部工程施工完毕，检查质量合乎设计标准后，在工程任务单上签字，办理工程交工验收。
      （4）根据材料限额领、发材料，并监督保证合理的使用，避免浪费。
    （5）经常进行安全技术教育，贯彻安全技术规程，保证安全措施的执行，以保证安全施工。
    （6）改善劳动组织，推广先进经验，推行记件工资制与计时奖励制，考核工人工作成绩，对工人工资等级及奖惩提出处理意见，以不断巩固劳动纪律，提高劳动生产率。
    （7）配合工会发动与组织劳动竞赛，保证按时与提前完成施工计划。
