Major Cities Across the Country
    New Children's Films to be Screened for "June 1st"

    Several new children's films will be screened in major cities across the country for "June 1st" International Children's Day, which is the best gift for children. These films are: the feature film "Letter with Chicken Feathers," the stage documentary "Little White Rabbit," the documentaries "Happy Children" and "Southern Fujian Puppet Show," and the Soviet color documentary "Happy Childhood"; the Soviet color animated films "The Princess and the Seven Heroes," "Forest Travelers," and "The Story of the Yellow Crane," which were screened last year, will be screened more widely in various places this year.
    The film "Letter with Chicken Feathers" depicts the story of a child in an anti-Japanese base area behind enemy lines during the Anti-Japanese War who cleverly and bravely overcame all difficulties to deliver an urgent letter with chicken feathers to the Eighth Route Army. Cai Yuanyuan, who plays the main character Haiwa, is only twelve years old this year and very realistically portrays the image of a young hero in the Anti-Japanese War.
    The performers of "Little White Rabbit" are from the Attached Children's Troupe of the China Youth Art Theater. The main content of the film is about a little white rabbit who becomes arrogant and complacent after getting a hunter's gun. He separates himself from the group, acts alone, and is almost eaten by a fox and a wolf. Later, with the help of the group and the hunter, he escapes danger and kills the fox and the wolf. The children who play the little white rabbit, little female rabbit, and little black rabbit all perform very well. Especially the image of the little black rabbit, is even more loved by the audience.
    "Southern Fujian Puppet Show" records two puppet shows, "Lu'anzhou" and "Havoc in Heaven". The hand puppet show "Havoc in Heaven" performs the story of Sun Wukong's havoc in Heaven extremely wonderfully. The film also records the work behind the scenes, which can help children understand the creation and performance process of puppet shows.
    "Happy Children" and "Happy Childhood" record the happy lives of children in China and the Soviet Union. Many moving shots illustrate that our children are enjoying all kinds of happiness, and at the same time, they will also be laborers and fighters who create happiness and defend happiness.
    The three Soviet color animated films unfold an extremely beautiful and moving world in front of the audience. The films awaken children's rich imaginations, and children will be educated in intimate and moving stories.
    In Beijing, from June 1st, cinemas throughout the city will also screen feature films suitable for children to watch, such as "Blessing for Children," "First Grade Girl," "Young Pioneers," "Son of the League," "Strange Seeds," and the documentary short film "Summer Life of the Young Pioneers," etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国各大城市
    “六一”将放映新的儿童影片
      “六一”国际儿童节，全国各主要城市将放映好几部新的儿童影片，这是给孩子们的最好的礼物。这些影片是：故事片“鸡毛信”，舞台纪录片“小白兔”，纪录片“幸福儿童”、“闽南傀儡戏”和苏联的彩色纪录片“幸福的儿童时代”；去年放映过的苏联彩色动画片“公主和七勇士”、“森林旅行者”、“黄鹤的故事”，今年将更广泛地在各地放映。
    “鸡毛信”这个影片是描写抗日战争时期敌后抗日根据地的一个儿童，机智勇敢地克服了一切困难，给八路军送去一封紧急的鸡毛信的故事。扮演主要角色海娃的蔡元元，今年才十二岁，很朴实地表现出抗日战争中小英雄的形象。
    “小白兔”的演出者是中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团。影片的主要内容是描写一个小白兔因为得到了猎人的枪，就自高自大得意忘形起来。他脱离集体，独往独来，险些被狐狸和狼吃掉。后来，还是在集体和猎人的帮助下，才脱了险，并打死了狐狸和狼。扮演小白兔、小雌兔、小黑兔的小朋友，演得都很好。特别是小黑兔这个形象，更为观众们所喜爱。
      “闽南傀儡戏”纪录了“潞安州”、“闹天宫”两个傀儡戏。掌上木偶戏“闹天宫”，把孙悟空大闹天宫这段故事表演得极为精彩。影片还纪录了后台的工作情况，可以帮助儿童们了解傀儡戏的创造和表演过程。
      “幸福儿童”和“幸福的儿童时代”纪录了中国和苏联儿童的幸福生活。许多动人的镜头说明：我们的儿童正享受着各种幸福，同时，他们也将是创造幸福和保卫幸福的劳动者和战士。
    苏联的三部彩色动画片，在观众面前展开了极其美丽动人的天地，影片唤起儿童丰富的想像，儿童们将在亲切和动人的故事里得到教育。
    在北京，全市影院六月一日起还将放映适合儿童看的故事片“为孩子们祝福”、“一年级女生”、
  “红领巾”、“团的儿子”、“奇异的种子”以及纪录短片“少先队的夏季生活”等。（新华社）
