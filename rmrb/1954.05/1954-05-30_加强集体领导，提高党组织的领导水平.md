Strengthen Collective Leadership and Improve the Leadership Level of Party Organizations
Chen Yunpeng, Deputy Secretary of the Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs

Collective leadership is the highest principle of our Party's leadership. This is because only collective leadership can eliminate individual leadership, ensure the correctness of the formulation and implementation of the Party's decisions, directives, and plans, and avoid one-sidedness or errors in the formulation and implementation of Party resolutions. Only collective leadership can ensure the consistency of ideological understanding within the Party committee and promptly expose and eliminate shortcomings or errors in the ideology, work style, and policy implementation of the Party organization's leading members. Only collective leadership can resist localism and decentralism. Only collective leadership can strengthen Party unity and improve the combat effectiveness of Party organizations. At the same time, collective leadership is also an effective way to train and familiarize cadres. Because collective study and handling of problems can train the thinking methods of each leader, enrich their leadership experience, and enable Party organizations to become familiar with and understand the policy thinking level, business capabilities, and organizational concepts of each leader.

How to implement the system of collective leadership? Based on our situation, the following issues must be resolved:

First, we must correct various erroneous understandings of the system of collective leadership. The erroneous understandings of Party organizations and members regarding collective leadership are mainly reflected in the following aspects:

Some Party members believe that the provincial direct organs are the leading organs of the entire province, and the leading cadres have high levels and rich experience in struggle. Therefore, not implementing collective leadership will not lead to major errors, while implementing collective leadership requires a lot of preparation and increases a lot of trouble. This understanding is one-sided and therefore incorrect. A high level of leadership and rich experience in struggle are favorable conditions for achieving correct leadership, but it is still necessary to strictly adhere to the principle of collective leadership to ensure that the decisions made are completely correct. Stalin once pointed out: "Individual decisions are always or almost always one-sided." ("Conversation with the German writer Ludwig") No matter how high the level of the leader or how rich the experience in struggle, there are still limitations, and therefore individual decisions are difficult to be completely correct. The reason why these comrades cannot understand this issue in this way is precisely because they emphasize the role of individual leaders and neglect the role of collective leadership. The claim that collective leadership is troublesome is also clearly incorrect. Because they only see the trouble of preparation work and do not see the important role of collective leadership, nor do they think that if they are greedy for simplicity and convenience, it will cause many losses to the cause of the Party and the people. As far as preparation work is concerned, is it too troublesome? Actually not. Preparation work is nothing more than ideological and organizational preparation, that is, notifying the participants of the issues to be discussed and studied before the meeting so that they can consider these issues in advance in order to prepare their own opinions. Before discussing all major issues, the Party organization must also instruct relevant personnel to draft written materials and distribute them to relevant personnel for more thorough deliberation and preparation. This preparation work should be done and must be done. If this preparation work is regarded as troublesome, then the so-called convenience can only be based on a certain leader's personal handling of problems and decision-making, which will inevitably bring huge losses to the work. These statements essentially reflect that some leaders of Party organizations are still accustomed to making personal decisions on major issues and are unwilling to abandon the habit of individual leadership. Therefore, this incorrect thinking must be criticized so that they realize that only by implementing the system of collective leadership can the wisdom and experience of all leading members be invested in the collective cause, making the Party's leadership more powerful, correct, and perfect.

Some people say that realizing collective leadership will hinder the initiative of Party organizations' leadership. This statement is without any basis. Because the initiative of any Party organization's leadership must be based on the predictability of leadership, and this predictability is clearly not something that a few people can achieve. Because individual intelligence is always limited, only by giving play to collective wisdom and absorbing collective experience can the initiative of Party organizations' leadership be strengthened. Therefore, realizing collective leadership will not only not hinder the initiative of Party organizations' leadership, but will instead strengthen the initiative of Party organizations.

Some people say that realizing collective leadership will hinder Party unity. The reason is: collective research and discussion will lead to various different opinions, which will lead to disagreements and disunity. This understanding is clearly wrong. Since there are differences of opinion within the Party, it is necessary to criticize erroneous opinions and affirm correct opinions on the basis of extensively carrying out criticism and debate in order to achieve ideological unity within the Party, because Party unity is built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology and on the basis of correct political principles and correct organizational principles. The reason why these comrades are afraid that collective leadership will hinder unity is because they understand Party unity as everyone being harmonious, living in peace, and ignoring shortcomings and errors without criticizing or correcting them. This understanding of Party unity is clearly wrong. This so-called unity of harmony is fundamentally incompatible with the principles of Marxist-Leninist unity.

Some people say that realizing collective leadership will reduce individual responsibility. The reason is: collective leadership relies on everyone to come up with ideas and methods, and if something goes wrong, everyone is responsible. Isn't this reducing individual responsibility? This understanding is clearly wrong. This idea reflects that some comrades still lack the idea of being fully responsible to the Party, and they still do not understand the responsibilities that individual members of the Party organization's leadership should bear in the Party organization. The principle of collective leadership requires each leading member to use their brains, carefully study the Party's policies, and deeply understand the problems in the work, and to boldly and responsibly put forward their own opinions when collectively studying and deciding on problems. After the Party organization concentrates everyone's opinions and makes decisions and instructions, the responsibility of each leading member is to independently and responsibly strive to implement the Party's resolutions and instructions in accordance with their own division of labor. At the same time, they should examine the correctness of the resolutions, instructions, and plans through the implementation situation, promptly report to the Party organization in a responsible manner, and actively put forward suggestions for improvement. It is very clear that realizing collective leadership not only does not reduce individual responsibility, but increases the individual responsibility of leading members. In fact, in the case of an unsound system of collective leadership, within the Party organization, people are accustomed to making personal decisions, and many Party committee members do not care about the Party's overall work at all, and push many major issues to the secretary to handle alone. This truly weakens the sense of responsibility of the Party's leading members.

In order to implement the Party's system of collective leadership, we must overcome the above-mentioned various erroneous understandings, so that every Party member recognizes that any phenomenon that violates the principles of the Party's collective leadership will affect the Party's unity and the smooth realization of the Party's general line, thereby fighting against all phenomena that violate the principles of the Party's collective leadership.

Second, to implement the principles of the Party's collective leadership, we must improve the Party committee system. The Party committee system is the basic system for implementing the principles of the Party's collective leadership. If the Party committee system is sound, all major issues will be collectively studied and decided by all members at the Party committee meeting, which can avoid individual decision-making and ensure the correctness of leadership. To improve the Party committee system, the following issues must be resolved:

Some Party members believe that improving the Party committee system is a matter for the Party's leading organs above the county level, and Party grassroots organizations do not need to emphasize the Party committee system. This understanding is wrong. Improving the Party committee system is a matter for Party organizations at all levels. Therefore, it is also necessary to strengthen the collective leadership role of the branch committee. Some general branches and branches have an unclear understanding of the committee system, and therefore do not pay attention to the use and play of the role of the committee system. Some general branches and branches rarely hold meetings to study more important work, and use the method of circulation and soliciting opinions to replace collective discussion. In some general branches or branches, branch committee members often handle some major issues alone. For example, the study of all Party members is handled by only one propaganda committee member, and the branch committee does not ask about it. Party grassroots organizations shoulder important tasks in implementing the Party's policies and connecting with the masses. Therefore, these erroneous views and practices must be corrected, and the collective leadership role of these organizations must be earnestly brought into play in order to correctly implement the Party's various policies.

Party committee members must often care about and study the Party organization's overall work. Only in this way can Party committee members put forward more correct and comprehensive opinions at the Party committee meeting. However, this is not easy to do. Some part-time committee members often do not care about the work of the Party organization at all, while full-time committee members do not care about the Party organization's overall work or central work, but only care about the work of their respective management departments in isolation. Some secretaries of the Party committee often only care about the overall work or central work, but do not pay much attention to the work of the departments. These are all wrong. Because Party committee members are all members of the Party committee, and the Party committee is responsible for leading the entire work of the area or unit under its jurisdiction. If Party committee members do not care about the work of the Party committee or the overall work of the Party committee, they have not undertaken the entrustment of the Party members. And if the committee members in charge of the Party's departmental work do not ask about the Party organization's overall work, then the departmental work will not be done well, because departmental work must not be separated from the whole and carried out in isolation. The secretaries of Party committees at all levels, while caring about the overall work or central work, must also care about the work of the departments, and properly arrange the departmental work so that it serves the realization of the overall work or central work. Only in this way can Party committee members correctly implement the division of labor and responsibility under the unified leadership of the Party committee.

There must be full preparation for convening a Party committee meeting. When the Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Party Committee convenes a plenary meeting, it is generally able to write the issues to be discussed into written materials two or three days before the meeting and distribute them to the participants. At the meeting, the Party committee also designated Party committee members to first make reports on relevant issues, and then launch a discussion. In this way, the committee members attending the meeting can actively put forward more mature opinions, and the meeting time is short, and the meeting's resolutions are generally correct and feasible. However, some general branches and branches often do not pay attention to the preparation work for the meeting, so that the committee members speak based on temporary feelings and imagination at the meeting, and the issues raised are scattered, unsystematic, and cannot grasp the key points, thinking of where to speak, and even discuss but not decide, decide but not act.

Party committee meetings at all levels must discuss and study the problems in the work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The Party committee system requires the use of mutual criticism to correct each other's errors and supplement experience in order to formulate correct resolutions. In the practice of the past year, it has been felt that when studying and discussing problems at the meeting, if criticism and self-criticism can be launched, everyone will put forward many different viewpoints, and after discussion, a unified understanding will be reached. This unified understanding truly reflects collective will and collective wisdom. On the contrary, if everyone at the meeting cannot carry out criticism and self-criticism, is afraid of differences, and does not criticize or debate erroneous opinions, in this case, although the resolution is also passed, this resolution cannot represent the collective will and wisdom, and actually violates the principle of collective leadership.

Improving the meeting record system is a necessary measure for improving the Party committee system, and it is also a manifestation of the Party committee's responsibility for its own resolutions. Because through the meeting record, the Party committee's leadership thinking can be reflected, helping the Party committee to check at any time whether its resolutions are correct, and improving the sense of responsibility of Party committee members for their opinions and for the Party committee meeting. At the same time, it can also help the Party committee to concentrate the opinions of the majority and retain the opinions of the minority. However, some of our Party organizations do not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity of improving the meeting record system. Some general branches and branch meeting record systems are extremely unsound, the content is intermittent and incomplete, the handwriting is scribbled, and it is impossible to see the central issues discussed and resolved at the meeting. Some general branches and branches do not even have meeting records at all. After a long time, everyone forgets the meeting decisions. When the higher Party committee checks the issues they have decided, one committee member says one thing, especially when encountering wrong decisions, everyone wants to shirk responsibility. Therefore, when Party committees at all levels hold meetings, they should designate comrades with high policy and cultural levels to be responsible for recording. The records should clearly record what kind of meeting is held, what topics are discussed, the time, location, the number of people present and absent, who presided over the meeting, who made the conclusion, what disputes there were, what the content of the resolution was, etc.

Third, Party organizations should convene Party representative assemblies, representative meetings, and branch Party member meetings on schedule to report work to Party members and re-elect Party committees at all levels. This is an important method for realizing collective leadership. Convening these meetings on schedule can not only enable Party members to supervise and inspect the Party committee and Party leaders, but also give play to Party members' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for the work of Party organizations, thereby improving and enhancing the work of Party organizations. The activities of Party organizations are subject to the regular supervision of Party members, which can avoid or prevent certain leaders from becoming complacent because of some minor achievements. The Songjiang Provincial Direct Organs Party Organizations (mainly general branches and branches) do not have a very clear understanding of this issue. Although most general branches and branches can regularly convene branch Party member meetings to conduct re-elections or report work to all Party members, and some units have also achieved good results, formalistic practices still exist. For example, some general branches and branches simply believe that the term of office of the committee members has expired and it is time to change them, so they do not seriously consider the list of candidates for the next committee. Some Party members also lack understanding of this issue, so that some Party members with unhealthy ideological consciousness, who do not pay attention to the work of the Party, and who do not have high prestige among the masses are elected as committee members. Because of this understanding, these Party organizations do not seriously summarize and check the past work. They believe that it is not appropriate to re-elect without explaining the past work to the Party members, so they just perfunctorily do it. In these summary reports, they often only list some facts, lacking analysis and criticism of the past work, failing to affirm achievements, failing to expose and criticize shortcomings and errors, and failing to put forward issues that need attention in the future. This approach is clearly not able to achieve the purpose of implementing collective leadership and promoting inner-Party democracy. For this reason, Party organizations and Party members at all levels must recognize the important significance of convening Party representative assemblies, representative meetings, or branch Party member meetings, and earnestly and conscientiously implement this system.

    加强集体领导，提高党组织的领导水平
    中共松江省直属机关委员会副书记　陈云鹏
    集体领导是我们党的领导的最高原则。这是因为，只有集体领导，才能排除个人领导，保证党的各项决定、指示、计划制订和执行的正确性，避免在制订和执行党的决议时发生片面性的缺点或错误；只有集体领导，才能保证党委思想认识上的一致，并及时揭发和消除党组织领导成员在思想作风上以及执行政策上的缺点或错误；只有集体领导，才能抵制本位主义和分散主义的偏向；只有集体领导，才能增强党的团结，提高党组织的战斗力。同时集体领导也是培养和熟悉干部的一种有效的方法。因为集体研究和处理问题，能够锻炼每个领导者的思想方法，丰富他们的领导经验，并使党的组织能够熟悉和了解每个领导者的政策思想水平、业务能力以及组织观念。
    如何贯彻集体领导制呢？从我们这里的情况看，必须解决以下几个问题：
    第一，必须纠正对集体领导制的各种错误认识。党组织和党员们对集体领导的错误认识，主要表现在以下几个方面：
    有一部分党员认为省直属机关是全省的首脑机关，领导干部水平较高，有丰富的斗争经验，因而不实行集体领导也不会出大的差错，而实行集体领导，则需要进行很多准备工作，增加许多麻烦。这种认识是片面的，因而是不对的。领导水平较高，斗争经验丰富，是实现正确领导的一个有利条件，但还必须严格遵守集体领导原则，才能保证所决定的问题完全正确。斯大林曾指出：“个人的决定总是或几乎总是片面的。”（“与德国作家路德维希的谈话”）不管领导者个人的水平多么高，斗争经验多么丰富，但仍有它的局限性，因而个人决定问题，也就难以完全正确。这些同志所以不能这样去认识这一问题，正是因为他们强调了领导者个人的作用，而忽视了集体领导的作用。那种认为集体领导麻烦的说法显然也是不正确的。因为他们只看到准备工作的费事，而没有看到集体领导的重要作用，没有想到如果贪图简单和省事，将会给党和人民的事业造成许多损失。就从准备工作来说，是否太费事呢？其实不然。准备工作不外乎思想上和组织上的准备，即在会前把要讨论和研究的问题通知与会人员，使他们能够事先考虑这方面的问题，以便准备自己的意见。在讨论一切重大问题之先，党的组织还必须责成有关人员起草书面材料，发给有关人员，以便大家进行更充分的酝酿准备工作。这些准备工作都是应该做而且必须做的。如果把这些准备工作看成是费事，那么，所谓省事，就只能是凭某个领导者个人处理问题和决定问题，这样必然会给工作带来巨大的损失。这些说法实质上反映了某些党组织的领导者，还是习惯于个人决定重大问题，而不愿意抛弃个人领导的习气。因此必须批判这种不正确的思想，使他们认识到只有贯彻集体领导制才能把全体领导成员的智慧和经验投入集体事业中去，使党的领导更加有力、正确和完善。
    有些人说，实现集体领导会妨碍党组织领导的主动性。这种说法是没有任何根据的。因为任何党组织领导的主动性，都必须以领导的预见性做基础，而这种预见性，显然不是靠少数人所能做到的。因为个人的聪明才智总是带有局限性的，只有发挥集体智慧，吸取集体经验，才能加强党组织领导的主动性。因此，实现集体领导不但不会妨碍党组织领导的主动性，相反的将会加强党组织的主动性。
    有些人说，实现集体领导会妨碍党的团结。理由是：集体研究讨论就会有各种不同的见解，就会产生分歧意见，就会闹不团结。这种认识显然是错误的。党内既然有分歧意见，就需要在广泛的开展批评开展争论的基础上，来批判错误的意见，肯定正确的意见，求得党内思想的统一，因为党的团结是建筑在马克思列宁主义思想基础之上的团结，是建筑在正确的政治原则和正确的组织原则基础之上的团结。这些同志所以害怕集体领导会妨碍团结，是因为他们把党的团结理解做大家一团和气、和平共处，见到缺点和错误听之任之，也不去批评不去纠正。这样的来理解党的团结显然是错误的。这种一团和气的所谓团结，是与马克思列宁主义的团结的原则根本不相符合的。
      有些人说，实现集体领导，就会减轻个人的责任。理由是：集体领导靠大家出主意想办法，错了由大家负责，这还不是减轻了个人的责任吗？这种认识显然也是错误的。这种想法反映了有些同志还缺乏对党全面负责的思想，而且也还不了解党组织的领导成员个人在党组织中应负的责任。集体领导的原则要求每个领导成员开动脑筋，认真钻研党的政策和深入地了解工作中的问题，在集体研究和决定问题时，大胆负责地提出自己的意见。当党组织把大家的意见集中起来，做出决定、指示后，每个领导成员的责任就是按照自己的分工，独立负责地去努力执行党的决议、指示，同时，通过执行情况考察决议、指示、计划的正确性，及时向党组织作负责的汇报，积极地提出改进的意见。很明显的，实现集体领导，不但没有减轻了个人的责任，而是加重了领导成员个人的责任；事实上，在集体领导制不健全的情况下，党组织内，习惯于个人决定问题，很多党委委员根本不关心党的全面工作，把很多重大问题都推给书记去包办，这才真正削弱了党的领导成员的责任心。
    为了贯彻党的集体领导制，必须克服以上各种错误认识，使每个党员都认识到任何违犯党的集体领导的原则的现象，都会影响党的团结，影响党的总路线的顺利实现，从而和一切违反党的集体领导原则的现象进行斗争。
    第二，贯彻党的集体领导的原则，必须健全党委制。党委制是贯彻党的集体领导原则的基本制度。党委制健全了，一切重大问题都在党委会上由全体委员集体研究决定，就可以避免个人决定问题，保证领导的正确性。健全党委制必须解决以下几个问题：
    有些党员认为健全党委制是县以上党的领导机关的事，党的基层组织则不必强调党委制。这种认识是不对的。健全党委制是党的各级组织的事。因此，也必须加强支部委员会的集体领导作用。有的总支、支部由于对委员制的认识不明确，因而不注意运用与发挥委员制的作用；有的总支、支部很少开会研究比较重要的工作，而用传阅、征询意见的方法，代替集体讨论；有的总支或支部中，支部委员常常单独处理一些重大问题，比如有关全体党员的学习问题，只有宣传委员一人处理，支部委员会就不过问。党的基层组织在贯彻党的政策和联系群众方面担负着重大的任务。因此必须纠正这些错误的看法和做法，认真发挥这些组织的集体领导作用，才能正确地贯彻党的各种政策。
    党组织的委员必须经常关心和研究党组织的全盘工作。只有如此，党委委员们才能够在党的委员会上提出比较正确和全面的意见。但是，这一点并不容易做到。有些兼职的委员往往根本不过问党组织的工作，而专职的委员则不关心党组织的全盘工作或中心工作，只是孤立地关心他们各自管理的部门工作。党的委员会的书记，有的常常只关心全盘工作或中心工作，而不太关心部门的工作。这都是不对的。因为党组织的委员，都是党的委员会的一员，而党的委员会是负责领导所属地方或单位的整个工作的。如果党委委员不关心党委的工作或党委的全盘工作，就是没有承担起党员的委托。而负责党的部门工作的委员如果不过问党组织的全盘工作，则部门工作也是做不好的，因为部门工作，决不能脱离整体而孤立地去进行。党的各级委员会的书记，在关心全盘工作或中心工作的同时，也要关心各部门的工作，妥善地安排部门工作，使之为实现全盘工作或中心工作服务。也只有这样，党委委员才能在党委会统一领导下，正确地执行分工负责制。
    召开党委会，必须有充分的准备。松江省直属机关党委召开全体会议时，一般的都能在开会前两三天将要讨论的问题写成书面材料发给与会的人员。在会议上，党委并指定党委委员先做有关问题的报告，然后展开讨论。这样，到会的委员都能积极地提出比较成熟的意见，而且会议的时间短，会议的决议一般也都是正确的、可行的。但有的总支、支部往往不注意会议的准备工作，以致委员在会议上凭临时感觉和想像发言，提出的问题零乱、不系统，抓不住要害，想到哪说到哪，甚至议而不决，决而不行。
    党的各级委员会议，必须以批评和自我批评的精神去讨论与研究工作中的问题。党委制要求用互相批评的办法来彼此纠正错误和补充经验，以便制订正确的决议。一年来在实践中体会到在会议上研究与讨论问题时，如果能够展开批评和自我批评，大家就会提出许多不同的观点，经过争论，就取得了一致的认识。这种统一的认识是真正体现集体意志集体智慧的。相反的，如果会议上大家不能开展批评和自我批评，害怕分歧，对错误的意见不批评不争论，在这种情况下，虽然决议也通过了，但这种决议并不能代表集体的意志和智慧，实际上是违反集体领导原则的。
    健全会议记录制度，是健全党委制的一项必要措施，也是党委对自己决议负责的一种表现。因为通过会议记录，可以反映党委的领导思想，帮助党委随时来检查自己的决议是否正确，以及提高党委委员对自己所发表的意见和对党委会议的责任感。同时，它也能帮助党委集中多数人的意见，而又保留少数人的意见。但我们有些党的组织对健全会议记录制度的必要性认识不足。有些总支、支部会议记录制度极不健全，内容间断不全，字迹潦草，看不出会议讨论和解决的中心问题。有的总支、支部甚至根本没有会议记录。时间长了，大家对会议决定也就忘了。当上级党委检查他们所决定的问题时，一个委员说一样，特别是遇到错误的决定，大家就都想推诿责任。因此，党的各级委员会开会时，应该指定政策、文化水平较高的同志负责记录。记录应该把开什么会、什么议题、时间、地点、出席和缺席的人数、谁主持、谁做结论、有那些争论、决议的内容是什么等，都记得清清楚楚。
    第三、党组织应按期召开党员代表大会、代表会议以及支部党员大会，来向党员报告工作并改选各级党的委员会。这是实现集体领导的重要方法。按期召开这些会议，不但能使党员对党的委员会及党的领导者进行监督和检查，而且能够发挥党员的积极性和对党组织工作的责任心，从而改进和提高党组织的工作。党组织的活动受到了党员的经常的监督，就可以避免或防止某些领导者因一些微小的成绩而骄傲自满的情绪。松江省直属机关党组织（主要是总支、支部）对这个问题的认识并不十分明确。虽然多数总支、支部都能定期召开支部党员大会进行改选或向全体党员报告工作，有些单位也获得了很好的效果，但形式主义的做法还是存在的。如有的总支、支部在进行改选时，只是单纯地认为委员的任期已满，该换换了，因而不认真地考虑下届委员会的候选人名单。有些党员对此问题也缺乏认识，因而使一些思想意识不健康、不重视党的工作，在群众中威信不高的党员被选为委员。因为有了这种认识，这些党组织也就不认真总结和检查过去的工作，他们认为改选不向党员交代一下过去的工作也说不过去，于是就应付了事。在这些总结报告中，常常只是罗列一些事实，对过去的工作缺少分析批判，成绩不能肯定，缺点和错误得不到揭露和批判，今后需注意的问题提不出来。这种做法显然是不能达到贯彻集体领导和发扬党内民主的目的。为此，党的各级组织及党员必须要认识召开党的代表大会、代表会议或支部党员大会的重要意义，并认真地、切实地执行这一制度。
