The Second National Procuratorial Work Conference, held from March 17th to April 10th, passed a resolution on the guiding principles and tasks of the people's procuratorial work in the future. The resolution first pointed out that the people's procuratorial work has achieved preliminary successes in the past four years. People's Procuratorates have been established in more than one-third of the administrative units at or above the county level across the country. These People's Procuratorates have cooperated with various social reform movements such as the "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries," the "Three-Anti," and the "Five-Anti" movements from the perspective of people's procuratorial work, and have combined with the central work of the state in various periods to investigate and prosecute many illegal and criminal cases that endanger the interests of the state and the people. This has played a considerable role in safeguarding national economic construction, protecting the people's democratic rights, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship; at the same time, some preliminary work experience has been accumulated, and cadres have been trained and improved, laying the foundation for the further development of people's procuratorial work in the future. However, there are still many shortcomings in the current people's procuratorial work. The most important of these is the lack of planned and systematic focus on key pilot projects, which has resulted in the absence of a systematic, practical, and feasible procuratorial business system. This has prevented the people's procuratorial work from fully playing its due role in the fight against illegal and criminal phenomena, and has also made it difficult to universally carry out people's procuratorial work across the country today.

The resolution then pointed out that, based on the overall tasks of the state during the transition period, the guiding principles and tasks of procuratorial work in the future should be: in accordance with the principle of necessity and possibility, during the period of the state's first five-year construction plan, to systematically and fundamentally establish and improve the organization and work of people's procuratorates at all levels across the country in a planned and step-by-step manner; to use the people's democratic legal system to safeguard the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce from the procuratorial work perspective; to fight against all counter-revolutionary elements and various illegal and criminal elements who endanger economic construction, socialist transformation, and national order; to prosecute illegal and criminal cases involving all citizens, including state personnel; and to file public prosecutions with the people's courts on behalf of the state. According to this overall guiding principle and task, in terms of safeguarding the country's socialist industrialization, the people's procuratorial organs should fight against counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage the country's economic construction, fight against illegal and criminal elements who embezzle, steal, and damage state property, and prosecute other criminal cases involving major accidents caused by passive怠工, dereliction of duty, inspect illegal acts that violate labor laws and infringe on the legitimate interests of workers, in order to ensure the victorious completion of various economic construction tasks, especially industrial construction tasks. In safeguarding the state's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, we should fight against illegal and criminal elements who embezzle, steal, and damage the property of agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives, fight against acts of seeking personal gain and engaging in malpractice among the staff of various cooperatives and state-owned farms, and fight against all other illegal and criminal elements who sabotage agricultural production, sabotage the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and sabotage the handicraft cooperation. We should also regard safeguarding the implementation of the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and safeguarding the storage and transportation of grain as a regular aspect of our future work, and fight against speculative merchants who undermine the grain policy, as well as other illegal and criminal elements who collude with profiteers to engage in malpractice for personal gain, steal public grain, and undermine the state's grain policy. In safeguarding the state's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we should continue to fight against the "five poisons" crimes of unscrupulous capitalists and illegal and criminal acts that infringe upon the legitimate interests of the working class. While carrying out the above work, we must fight against counter-revolutionary elements, bandits, and other criminals who steal state secrets and endanger social stability, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. In order to provide fuller protection to the people's democratic rights under the people's democratic legal system that will be gradually improved in the future, the resolution stipulates that the people's procuratorial organs should pay attention to supervising whether government organs and state personnel strictly abide by state laws, act in accordance with state laws, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people; in particular, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the phenomena of wrong arrests, wrong detentions, and wrong judgments, as well as the illegal acts of certain state personnel.

In order to accomplish the above tasks, the people's procuratorial organs must actively, planfully, and step-by-step strengthen business construction, organizational construction, and ideological construction. In terms of business construction, a system for investigating and interrogating major criminal cases and for supervising investigations and interrogations should be established, a system for supervising trials should be established, a system for supervising prisons should be established, and a general supervision system should be gradually established. When establishing the above-mentioned procuratorial business systems, we must adopt the policy of proceeding from reality and advancing steadily, preventing both the idea of only being accustomed to engaging in movement-style work and lacking sufficient understanding of the establishment of a regular revolutionary legal system, and also preventing the impetuous mood of rushing to pursue a complete form of legal system regardless of specific conditions. To this end, we should earnestly summarize the experience of past procuratorial work, study the laws of illegal and criminal cases, summarize case studies in accordance with various procuratorial businesses, and combine with China's actual situation to learn and apply the advanced experience of Soviet procuratorial work, especially to earnestly conduct key pilot projects in procuratorial work, and cultivate a large number of local people's procuratorates with basic demonstration effects. People's Procuratorates at or above the provincial (municipal) level should all do a good job in key pilot projects in the procuratorial work of a city, an industrial and mining area, or a county in 1954, gain experience, and promote overall work. At present, we should especially focus on exploring and creating experience in how to use various procuratorial business systems to ensure the smooth progress of industrial and mining production, transportation, and basic construction, as well as experience in ensuring the state's implementation of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.

In strengthening the ideological leadership of people's procuratorial work and establishing a correct work style, the resolution emphasizes the idea of procuratorial work serving the central work through the exercise of procuratorial functions, and the working method of proceeding from reality, seeking truth from facts, and relying on the masses to conduct investigations and research, and emphatically points out that after the promulgation of the state's first constitution, the tasks of procuratorial work are very arduous, requiring all procuratorial personnel to be conscientious and diligent, modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, actively study business, and especially seize the key pilot projects at present, strive to obtain a relatively systematic set of experience in a relatively short period of time, and establish a backbone force that is relatively strong politically and professionally, in order to meet the needs of the development of procuratorial work in the future. At the same time, it must be recognized that the basic function of the procuratorial organs is to cooperate and coordinate with relevant organs, in accordance with state laws, to effectively suppress counter-revolutionaries and punish crimes. Therefore, when the procuratorate carries out its work, it should distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, the boundaries between right and wrong, and the priorities, distinguishing between the side that should be attacked and the side that should be protected. In the work, we must not only adhere to principles, fight against all illegal and criminal phenomena with impartiality and selflessness, but also strictly prevent and correct any ideas of privilege, and establish a spirit of collectivism in which the procuratorial organs unite and cooperate with relevant departments. The resolution stipulates that propaganda on people's procuratorial work should be strengthened in the future to educate cadres and the masses to better abide by state laws. The resolution finally requires cadres at all levels of the procuratorate to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and the overall tasks of the state during the transition period, learn from the advanced experience of Soviet procuratorial work, and constantly improve their political and ideological level and business ability. Draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and promptly correct shortcomings and mistakes. Earnestly promote the spirit of collective leadership, strengthen the organization and discipline of procuratorial personnel, conscientiously implement the system of asking for instructions and reporting to the party and government leading organs at all levels, and invite the party and government leading organs at all levels to strengthen their leadership over procuratorial work.

      第二届全国检察工作会议决议
      规定了今后检察工作的方针任务
      【本报讯】三月十七日到四月十日举行的第二届全国检察工作会议通过了关于今后人民检察工作方针任务的决议。决议首先指出：四年来，人民检察工作已经获得了初步的成就。全国已有三分之一以上的县级以上的行政单位建立了人民检察署。这些人民检察署都从人民检察工作方面配合了“镇反”、“三反”、“五反”等各项社会改革运动和司法改革运动，并结合国家各个时期的中心工作，检察了不少危害国家和人民利益的违法犯罪案件，对保障国家经济建设，保护人民民主权利，巩固人民民主专政起了相当的作用；同时也积累了一些初步的工作经验，锻炼和提高了干部，为今后人民检察工作的进一步开展奠定了基础。但是，目前人民检察工作还存在着不少的缺点。其中最主要的是没有有计划有系统地切实抓住重点试验的工作，因而直到现在还缺乏一套系统的切实可行的检察业务制度。这就使人民检察工作未能充分发挥它在与违法犯罪现象作斗争中应有的作用，也使得今天在全国普遍开展人民检察工作遇到了困难。
    决议接着指出：根据国家在过渡时期的总任务，今后检察工作的方针任务应是：根据需要和可能的原则，在国家第一个五年建设计划的时期内，有计划有步骤地把全国各级人民检察署的组织和工作系统地基本上建立和健全起来，运用人民民主的法制，从检察工作方面保障国家社会主义工业化和国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，向一切反革命分子及各种危害经济建设、危害社会主义改造、危害国家秩序的违法犯罪分子进行斗争，检察所有国民包括国家工作人员在内的违法犯罪案件，并代表国家向人民法院提起公诉。根据这一总的方针任务，在保障国家社会主义工业化方面，人民检察机关应向破坏国家经济建设的反革命分子进行斗争，向贪污、盗窃和破坏国家财产的违法犯罪分子进行斗争，并检察其他因消极怠工、玩忽职守而造成重大责任事故的刑事案件，检察违犯劳动法规和侵害工人合法利益的违法行为，以保障各项经济建设任务首先是工业建设任务的胜利完成。在保障国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面，应该向贪污、盗窃和破坏农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社和手工业合作社财产的违法犯罪分子进行斗争，向各种合作社和国营农场工作人员中的营私舞弊行为进行斗争，向其他一切破坏农业生产、破坏农业互助合作运动及手工业合作化的违法犯罪分子进行斗争。并应把保障国家粮食统购统销政策的实现以及保障粮食的储运工作作为今后经常工作的一个方面，向破坏粮食政策的投机奸商以及其他勾结奸商营私舞弊、盗窃公粮、破坏国家粮食政策的违法犯罪分子进行斗争。在保障国家对资本主义工商业的改造方面，应向不法资本家的“五毒”罪行以及侵害工人阶级合法利益的违法犯罪行为继续进行斗争。在进行上述工作的同时，必须向盗窃国家机密、危害社会安宁的反革命分子、盗匪及其他犯罪分子进行斗争，以巩固人民民主专政。为了在今后逐步完备起来的人民民主法制之下，对于人民的民主权利予以更为充分的保护，决议规定：人民检察机关应注意监督政府机关和国家工作人员是否严守国家的法律、按照国家法律办事和保护人民的合法权益；特别是要防止和克服错捕、错押、错判现象及某些国家工作人员的违法行为。
    为了完成上述任务，人民检察机关必须积极地有计划有步骤地加强业务建设、组织建设和思想建设。在业务建设方面，应建立起重要刑事案件的侦讯及侦讯监督制度，应建立起审判监督制度，应建立监所监督制度，应逐步建立一般监督制度。在建立上述检察业务制度时，必须采取从实际出发、稳步前进的方针，既要防止只习惯于搞运动的工作方式，而对于建立正规的革命法制认识不足的思想，也要防止不顾具体条件急于追求完备的法制形式的急躁情绪。为此，应认真地总结过去检察工作的经验，研究违法犯罪案件的规律，按照各项检察业务总结案例，并结合我国实际情况学习和运用苏联检察工作的先进经验，特别是要认真进行检察工作的重点试验，培养出一大批具有基点示范作用的地方人民检察署。省（市）以上人民检察署均应在一九五四年内，做好一个城市、一个工矿区或一个县检察工作的重点试验，取得经验，推动全面。在目前尤应着重摸索和创造如何运用各项检察业务制度以保障工矿生产、交通运输和基本建设顺利进行的经验，以及保障国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的经验。
    在加强人民检察工作的思想领导和树立正确的工作作风方面，决议强调检察工作通过检察职能的行使为中心工作服务的思想和从实际出发，实事求是，依靠群众调查研究的工作方法，并着重指出：在国家的第一个宪法颁布后，检察工作的任务是很繁重的，要求全体检察工作人员兢兢业业，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，积极钻研业务，在目前特别抓紧重点试验，争取在较短期内，取得一套比较系统的经验，建立一支在政治上业务上比较坚强的骨干队伍，以适应今后检察工作发展的需要。同时必须认识检察机关的基本职能是协同和配合有关机关，依照国家法律，有效地镇压反革命和惩治犯罪。因此检察署在进行工作时，应分清敌我界限和是非轻重的界限，分清应该打击的一面和应该保护的一面。在工作中既要坚持原则，铁面无私地和一切违法犯罪现象作斗争，又要严格防止和纠正任何特权思想，树立检察机关与有关部门团结合作的集体主义的精神。决议规定今后应加强对人民检察工作的宣传，教育干部和群众更好地遵守国家的法律。决议最后要求各级检察干部应认真学习马克思列宁主义和国家过渡时期的总任务，学习苏联检察工作的先进经验，不断地提高自己的政治思想水平和业务能力。划清工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的界限、开展批评和自我批评，及时纠正缺点和错误。切实发扬集体领导精神，加强检察人员的组织性和纪律性，认真执行对各级党政领导机关的请示报告制度，并请各级党政领导机关加强对检察工作的领导。
