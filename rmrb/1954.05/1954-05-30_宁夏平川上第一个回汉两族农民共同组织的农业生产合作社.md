    The First Agricultural Production Cooperative Jointly Organized by Hui and Han Farmers on the Pingchuan Plain of Ningxia
    By Our Reporter Bai Huai
    In the spring of 1952, the Luo Zhankui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luojiazhuang, a western suburb of Yinchuan, was established. This was the first cooperative jointly organized by Hui and Han farmers on the Pingchuan Plain of Ningxia. During more than two years of collective production, the members of this agricultural production cooperative not only improved their living standards but also eliminated the ethnic estrangement that had been left over for many years and established new ethnic feelings, laying the foundation for further improving production.
    Luojiazhuang is a village where the Hui and Han nationalities live together. Before liberation, the Hui and Han farmers here lived a life of blood and tears under the oppression of Ma Hongkui's bandit gang, the "local emperor" of Ningxia. Heavy taxes weighed on the people's heads, and many young people were dragged into the army. The common people did not even dare to go home all day in order to escape military service. The Ningxia Plain, which was originally a "watered field that could be planted and harvested every year," became barren.
    Although the Hui and Han farmers in Luojiazhuang suffered equally from the cruel exploitation and persecution of Ma Hongkui's bandit gang, there was still estrangement and resulting disputes between the two ethnic groups. Before liberation, the contradictions and disputes between the Hui and Han peoples in production were very acute. The distribution of land in Luojiazhuang was the same as the residential situation of the Hui and Han peoples in Luojiazhuang. The land of a Hui household was close to the land of several Han households, and the land of a Han household was also close to the land of several Hui households. Sometimes they would fight over the order of irrigating the fields, or over whether this family wanted to plant wheat and that family wanted to plant rice. This kind of contradiction in production further deepened the mutual hatred and antagonism between the Hui and Han farmers.
    In September 1949, Ningxia was liberated. The broad masses of Hui and Han people began to break free from the shackles that had been around their necks for many years. On the one hand, the Party and the People's Government implemented the ethnic policy of equality, unity, and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. On the other hand, they helped the Hui and Han people in the newly liberated land to restore production and establish their homes. Many young people who had been dragged into the army by Ma Hongkui's bandit gang returned to the countryside one after another. The labor force increased, but due to the years of rule and exploitation by Ma Hongkui's bandit gang, production in the rural areas had not yet recovered at that time, and there was a great shortage of draught animals, farm tools, and seeds, and the lives of the peasants were also very hard, and there were still great difficulties in developing production. At this time, the Party launched mutual aid and mutual assistance among the Hui and Han farmers, and pointed out to everyone the road of organizing and taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Some people still had some concerns about mutual aid and cooperation: some people were afraid that they would suffer losses if they worked together, and some people were afraid that they would inevitably quarrel and fight again if they were together. Most people believed in the Party's words. In the short days after liberation, they personally experienced unprecedented freedom and warmth and were willing to follow the path pointed out by the Communist Party. In the process of production practice, it has also been proved that organizing not only did not increase disputes, but also reduced them compared to before organizing. In 1951, the number of mutual aid teams increased from three in 1950, when they were first organized, to sixteen.
    In 1951, two major events encouraged the Hui and Han farmers in Luojiazhuang. The first was that the mutual aid team's wheat harvest this year was awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and was rated as a model wheat high-yield team. Luo Zhankui and Ma Wangyu (both Hui people), the leader and deputy leader of the mutual aid team, participated in the Ningxia Provincial and Northwest District Labor Model Conferences, which was an unprecedented event in Luojiazhuang. For so many years, the farmers who had been beaten and abused and followed the cow's ass were now praised by the government and respected by everyone. This event not only increased everyone's labor enthusiasm but also made everyone realize that this honor was due to organizing, producing together, and overcoming difficulties together. The second major event was the land reform that was carried out in the winter of that year. The Hui and Han farmers in Luojiazhuang united to overthrow the landlord class. In the land reform movement, the class consciousness of the Hui and Han farmers was greatly improved, they recognized the real enemies, eliminated some of the estrangement between each other, and enhanced unity. After the land reform, many Hui and Han farmers were allocated land, livestock, and some means of production, and everyone had higher demands for developing production. They experienced the superiority of being organized from their own production achievements, and many people were willing to take the mutual aid team to the next level. Therefore, in the spring of 1952, the mutual aid team was transformed into an agricultural production cooperative, and Luo Zhankui was elected as the director of the agricultural production cooperative.
    Luojiazhuang's land is close to lakes on three sides, and the terrain is very low; the soil is saline-alkali sandy soil, which is not only prone to floods, but also affected by the excessive alkalinity in the land every year. In 1950 and 1951, more than 40 mu of wasteland were opened in the village, but no grain was harvested. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, Luo Zhankui planned to use the lake mud from the surrounding lakes to fertilize the land. This would not only dredge the lakes and reduce floods, but also reduce the alkalinity and increase fertilizer after the lake mud was applied to the fields, turning low-lying land into high-lying land. At first, everyone did not believe that doing so could really produce more grain. Digging lake mud required standing in the frozen lake mud and digging one hoe after another; carrying it to the ground in a backpack, one mu of land required carrying more than 20,000 jin of lake mud. Many members could not stand it. In the first two days, some members had swollen backs, and some members had torn clothes, and everyone was discouraged. It was only after repeated explanations that they persevered. In 1952, 25 mu of land were covered with lake mud.
    When the rice seedlings grew to three or four inches high, they were lush green, and there was no longer the phenomenon of being uneven and yellow and green. The members then had confidence in improving the soil with lake mud. By the time of the autumn harvest, the rice in the 25 mu of rice fields that had been covered with lake mud had grown to be half a person tall, and the average yield per mu was more than three shi and seven dou of rice, which was two shi more than the land that had not been covered with lake mud.
    Since the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, Luojiazhuang has not only improved its grain output year after year, but also completely changed the past mutual discrimination and hatred in the relationship between the Hui and Han nationalities, and a new atmosphere of unity and harmony has emerged. Disputes in production between Hui and Han farmers have gradually disappeared. The main reason is that the cooperative has adopted the unified management method of land "planting according to local conditions," giving full play to the potential of the land. The labor force is also uniformly allocated by the whole society, and the "division of labor and specialization" method is used to give play to individual strengths. In this way, everyone has established a collective ideology, and the contradictions in production have been greatly reduced. Another reason is that after the establishment of the cooperative, livestock and farm tools were all converted into shares at a discounted price, reducing the difficulties of Hui farmers in production. Before the establishment of the cooperative, the Han people had more land, livestock, and farm tools than the Hui people. At that time, among the 31 Hui households, there were only two draught cattle, three donkeys, and three two-ox plows, and other major farm tools were very lacking. Therefore, in any aspect, the difficulties for Hui people to develop production after liberation were greater than those of Han people. In the unified management of the cooperative, these difficulties of the Hui farmers have been appropriately resolved.
    In the first year of the establishment of the Luojiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, there were 13 households, 5 Hui households, and 8 Han households. This year, four households have been added. In addition to being awarded the model wheat high-yield team by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in 1951, they have also continuously won the high-yield awards for rice and wheat from the Ningxia Provincial People's Government in 1952 and 1953. In particular, in 1952, under the circumstances of disaster, it created a high yield record of 940 jin of rice per mu. The livestock and farm tools of the cooperative have also increased greatly. The living standards of the members have also improved accordingly. Last year, the cooperative's dividends were also much higher than the previous year. Luo Zhankui's family earned 4,850 work points in a year. The net income was equivalent to more than 4,761 jin of wheat, an increase of 107.1% compared to the previous year's income. Xie Chengzhu, a member, only had more than three mu of land. As a result of his active labor in the cooperative, he received more than 2,100 jin of wheat last year. He happily told people, "If you work alone, you will suffer to death. You can't grow 2,000 jin of grain with more than three mu of land."
    This year, the Luojiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to increase wheat production by 36 jin per mu and rice production by 50 jin per mu on the basis of last year. Both male and female members have full confidence to complete this higher task.

    宁夏平川上第一个回汉两族农民共同组织的农业生产合作社
    本报记者　白槐
    一九五二年的春天，银川市西郊罗家庄罗占魁农业生产合作社成立了。这是宁夏平川上第一个由回、汉两族农民共同组织起来的合作社。在两年多的集体生产过程中，这个农业生产合作社的社员们，不仅在生活上都提高了，而且也消除了多年遗留下来的民族隔阂，建立了新的民族感情，给进一步提高生产打下了基础。
    罗家庄是一个回族和汉族杂居的村庄。解放前，这里的回、汉族农民在宁夏的“土皇帝”马鸿逵匪帮的压迫下，过着血泪斑斑的生活。苛捐杂税压在人们的头上，好多青年人都被拉去当兵了。老百姓整天为着逃避兵役，连家也不敢回。本来是
  “年种年收水浇田”的宁夏川，弄得土地荒芜。
    罗家庄的回族和汉族农民虽然同样受着马鸿逵匪帮的残酷剥削和迫害，可是，两族人民之间依然存在着隔阂和因此而产生的纠纷。解放前，回、汉两族人民在生产上的矛盾和纠纷十分尖锐。罗家庄的土地分布情形也和罗家庄的回、汉两族居住情形一样，一户回民的土地靠近几户汉民的土地，一户汉民的土地也靠近几户回民的土地。有时为了往田里灌水的先后，有时为了这家要种麦，那家要种稻也会争吵得打起架来。这种生产上的矛盾，更加深了回汉两族农民的相互仇视和对立。
    一九四九年九月，宁夏解放了。广大回、汉族人民开始摆脱了多年来套在脖子上的枷锁。党和人民政府一方面根据共同纲领上的规定，执行了各民族平等、团结、互助的民族政策，另一方面又在刚解放的土地上帮助回、汉人民恢复生产、安家立业。许多过去被马鸿逵匪帮拉去当兵的青年都纷纷回到农村。劳动力增加了，但是由于马鸿逵匪帮多年统治压榨的结果，当时农村里的生产还未恢复，耕畜、农具、籽种都很缺乏，农民的生活也很苦，发展生产还有很大的困难。这时，党在回、汉族农民中发动了互助互济，给大家指出了组织起来、走互助合作的道路。有些人对互助合作还有些顾虑：有人怕组织起来一块干活自己吃亏；有人怕在一起又免不了吵嘴、打架。大多数人都相信党的话，他们从解放后短短的日子里，亲身体会了从来没有过的自由和温暖，愿意向着共产党所指的道路上走。在生产实践过程中，也证明了组织起来不但没有增加纠纷，而且反而比组织起来以前减少了。一九五
  一年互助组由一九五○年刚组织起来的三户增加到十六户。
      一九五一年有两件大事鼓舞了罗家庄回、汉族农民。第一件是这年互助组的小麦丰产，得到了中央人民政府农业部的奖励，被评为小麦丰产模范组。互助组正副组长罗占魁和马王玉（都是回民）分头参加了宁夏省和西北区的生产劳动模范会议，这在罗家庄是空前的盛事，多少年来挨打受气，跟着牛屁股转的庄稼汉，如今得到了政府的表扬，人人尊敬。这件事不仅提高了大家的劳动热情，同时也使大家认识到了这种光荣是由于组织起来、共同生产、共同克服困难得来的。第二件大事是在这年冬天，进行了土地改革，罗家庄回、汉两族农民团结起来，斗倒了地主阶级。在土地改革运动中，回、汉两族农民的阶级觉悟大大提高，认识了真正的敌人，消除了彼此之间的一些隔阂，增进了团结。土地改革后，许多回、汉族农民都分到了土地、牲畜和部分生产资料，大家对发展生产的要求更高了。他们从自己的生产成就上体验到了组织起来的优越性，好多人都愿意把互助组再提高一步，因此，一九五二年春天，互助组就转成了农业生产合作社，罗占魁被选为农业生产合作社的主任。
    罗家庄的土地三面靠近湖泊，地势很低；土质是盐碱性的沙质土壤，不仅容易遭受水灾，而且由于地里的碱性过重，每年庄稼收成也受影响。一九五○年和一九五一年庄里开了四十多亩荒地，都没有收下粮食。农业生产合作社成立以后，罗占魁就计划用周围湖里的湖泥来上地，这样不仅可以疏浚湖泊，减少水灾，同时，湖泥上到田里以后，也可以减少碱气，增加肥料，把低地变成高地。起初大家都不相信这样做能真正多打粮食。挖湖泥要站在冰冻的湖泥里一镢头一镢头地挖；用人一背斗一背斗地背到地里，一亩田要背两万多斤湖泥。好些社员都受不了，刚开始头两天，有的社员就压肿了脊背，有的社员擦破了衣服，大家都泄气了。经过反复地解释才坚持下来。一九五二年，上了二十五亩地的湖泥。
    稻秧长到三四寸高时，绿油油的一片，再没有七高八低黄一块、绿一块的现象。社员们这时才对上湖泥改良土壤有了信心。到了秋收的时候，二十五亩上过湖泥的稻田，稻子都长得有半人高，每亩平均收了三石七斗多稻子，比没上湖泥的地多收了两石。
    罗家庄自从成立了农业生产合作社以后，不仅在粮食产量上年年都有提高，回、汉民族的关系上也完全改变了过去的互相歧视和仇恨，出现了新的团结和睦气象。回、汉族农民生产上的纠纷渐渐绝迹了。主要原因是合作社采取了“因地种植”的土地统一经营办法，充分发挥了土地的潜在力量。劳力也由全社统一调配，用“分工分业”的办法，发挥了个人的特长。这样，就使大家都建立了集体思想，生产上的矛盾就大大减少。再一个原因就是合作社成立以后，牲畜、农具都折价入社，减少了回族农民在生产上的困难。成立合作社以前，无论在土地、牲畜、农具等方面，汉民都比回民多。当时在三十一户回民中，只有两条耕牛、三个毛驴和三个二牛抬杠犁，其他主要农具都很缺乏。因此，解放后回民发展生产的困难不论在哪方面说来都比汉民多。在合作社的统一经营中，回族农民的这些困难得到适当解决了。
    罗家庄农业生产合作社刚成立那一年，有十三户人家，五户回民，八户汉民。今年增加了四户。他们除了在一九五一年得到中央人民政府农业部的小麦丰产模范组的奖励外，一九五二年和一九五三年都连续得到宁夏省人民政府的水稻、小麦丰产奖。特别是一九五二年在有灾情的情况下，创造了每亩水稻产九百四十斤的高额增产纪录。合作社的牲畜、农具也大大增加。社员的生活也随之提高。去年合作社分红又比前年增加了很多，罗占魁全家一年得了四千八百五十个工分。纯收益折合小麦四千七百六十一斤多，比前年收入增加百分之一百零七点一。社员解成柱只有三亩多土地，他在合作社里积极劳动的结果，去年分了两千一百多斤小麦，他高兴地对人说：“要是单干的话，你就苦死，三亩多地也打不下两千斤粮食。”
    今年，罗家庄农业生产合作社计划在去年的基础上，每亩小麦增产三十六斤，水稻增产五十斤。男女社员都有着充分的信心，来完成这个更高的任务。
