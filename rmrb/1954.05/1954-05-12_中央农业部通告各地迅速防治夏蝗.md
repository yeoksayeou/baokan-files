The Central Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on May 10, requiring all regions to quickly prevent and control summer locusts. The notice stated: Summer locusts in Sihong County, Anhui Province, Shangshui County, Henan Province, and Pei County, Jiangsu Province, have already hatched; in locust areas of Tangshan and Handan in Hebei Province, most of the locust eggs have swollen and are about to hatch. It is estimated that in general locust areas, summer locusts may hatch in large numbers in mid- to late May. Due to the varying rainfall and climate in locust areas this spring, some locust areas are relatively dry, while others still have standing water that has not receded, so the hatching period may be extremely uneven. There is a possibility that summer and autumn locusts may hatch at the same time, further increasing the difficulty of prevention and control. To this end, agricultural cadres in locust-affected areas should establish a long-term locust control mindset and quickly make all preparations for locust control: prepare pesticides and equipment, wheat bran, organize the training of cadres and laborers (including powder sprayers and equipment operators), survey and construct airports, etc. Also, pesticides and equipment should be quickly transported to the areas where they will be used. If there is a shortage of pesticides and equipment, the province can adjust, purchase more, or organize the masses to capture and kill locusts manually. Also, assign full-time cadres to conduct reconnaissance, keep abreast of the locust situation at all times, and eliminate summer locusts before the third instar.

    中央农业部通告各地迅速防治夏蝗
    中央人民政府农业部于五月十日发出通告，要求各地迅速防治夏蝗。通告说：安徽省泗洪县、河南省商水县、江苏省沛县等地的夏蝗已孵化出土，有的已到二龄；河北省唐山、邯郸等地蝗区的蝗卵已大部膨涨，即将孵化出土。估计一般蝗区在五月中、下旬，夏蝗可能大量孵化出土。由于今春蝗区雨量气候不一，有些蝗区比较干旱，有的地方积水至今未退，孵化期也会极不整齐，夏蝗、秋蝗有连在一起的可能，更增加了防治上的困难。为此，蝗区各地农业干部应树立长期治蝗思想，迅速做好一切治蝗准备工作：准备药械、麦麸，组织训练干部、民工（包括喷粉手和药械手），勘察、修建机场等等。并将药械迅速运达使用地区，如药械不足，可由省调剂、增购，或组织群众用人工捕打。并指定专职干部进行侦查，随时掌握蝗情，将夏蝗消灭在三龄以前。
