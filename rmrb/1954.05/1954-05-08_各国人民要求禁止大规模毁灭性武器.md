(Xinhua News Agency, 6th) According to TASS: A movement demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction is widely underway in various parts of the world.

    In Germany, industrial workers from both East and West Germany, prominent German cultural figures, scientists, religious figures, and representatives of public organizations have joined the movement to ban weapons of mass destruction. At a meeting held in Halle on May 3rd, the chemical industry workers of all of Germany passed a resolution demanding that all German chemical industry workers unite to fight against the use of weapons of mass destruction. At a "May Day" rally attended by 100,000 employees in Munich, Ludwig Linsert, second chairman of the Bavarian branch of the West German Trade Union Federation, said in a speech: The use of weapons of mass destruction would endanger the survival of the German people. He also said: "Therefore, on this May Day in 1954, we demand a ban on atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. We demand that all weapons of mass destruction be declared illegal." When the famous German writer Thomas Mann met with a reporter from the Italian newspaper "Unità," he spoke about the worldwide movement to ban weapons of mass destruction. He pointed out that the struggle of the people of all countries against the use of atomic bombs "is a very good cause, and everyone must strive for the success of this cause."
    In Italy, the Rome City Council and the Florence City Council passed a resolution demanding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. This resolution was put forward by members of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Monarchist Party. City councils in Turin, Reggio, Ragusa, and other places have also passed resolutions demanding the prohibition of thermonuclear weapons.
    In Britain, two peace organizations—the "Association of Scientific Workers for Peace" and the "Medical Association for the Prevention of War"—organized a rally in London demanding a ban on hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs. The main speakers were Cecil Powell, professor of physics at the University of Bristol, and the famous pacifist Dr. Alex Comfort. Dr. Duncan Reiss, chairman of the "Medical Association for the Prevention of War," said that Britain should refuse to allow its territory to be used as a base for launching atomic bomb attacks.
    The Vaud State Council in Switzerland unanimously passed a resolution calling on the governments of major powers to reach an agreement on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and to establish universal and effective controls so that atomic energy can be used for peaceful purposes.
    The Brazilian Press Association also issued a statement calling on the United Nations to find ways for major countries to sign an agreement on the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons.

    各国人民要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社讯：世界各地广泛展开要求禁止原子弹、氢弹及其他大规模毁灭性武器的运动。
    在德国，东西德的产业工人、著名的德国文化工作者、科学家、宗教界人士和公众组织的代表都加入了争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器的运动。全德化学工业工人于五月三日在哈雷举行的会议上通过决议，要求德国所有的化学工业工人一致为反对使用大规模毁灭性武器而斗争。西德工会联合会巴伐利亚分会第二主席卢德韦希·林塞特在慕尼黑举行的有十万职工参加的“五一”节大会上演讲时说：使用大规模毁灭性武器将危害德国人民的生存。他又说：“因此，我们在一九五四年‘五一’的这一天，要求禁止原子弹和氢弹。我们要求宣布所有大规模毁灭性武器为非法。”著名的德国作家托马斯·曼在接见意大利“团结报”记者时，谈到世界性的争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器的运动。他指出：各国人民为反对使用原子弹而进行的斗争，“是一种很好的事业，每个人必须为这种事业的成功而努力。”
    在意大利，罗马市政委员会和佛罗伦萨市政委员会通过了一项要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决议案，这个决议案是由共产党、社会党、天主教民主党和保皇党党员提出的。都灵、勒佐、拉古萨等地的市政委员会也都通过了要求禁止热核子武器的决议。
    在英国，两个和平组织——“科学界争取和平协会”和“医学界防止战争协会”在伦敦组织的一次集会要求禁止氢弹与原子弹。主要发言者是布利斯托尔大学物理学教授塞西尔·鲍威尔和著名的非战主义者亚历克斯·康福特博士。“医学界防止战争协会”主席邓肯·雷斯博士说，英国应该拒绝让它的领土被利用来作为发动原子弹攻击的基地。
    瑞士沃州州议会一致通过决议，呼吁各大国政府就禁止大规模毁灭性武器达成协议，并建立普遍有效的管制，以使原子能用于和平的目的。
    巴西记者协会也发表声明，呼吁联合国组织设法使大国间签订关于禁止使用原子武器的协定。
