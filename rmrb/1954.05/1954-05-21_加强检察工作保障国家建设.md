    The Second National Procuratorial Work Conference, based on the Party and the country's general tasks during the transition period, reviewed and summarized past work and stipulated the guiding principles for future procuratorial work. This means that during the period of the country's First Five-Year Plan, the organization and work of people's procuratorates at all levels across the country should be systematically established and improved in a planned and step-by-step manner, according to needs and possibilities. Using the people's democratic legal system, we will ensure from the perspective of procuratorial work the realization of the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. We will fight against all counter-revolutionaries and various illegal and criminal elements who endanger economic construction, socialist transformation, and national order. We will investigate all illegal and criminal cases involving all citizens, including state employees, and file public prosecutions with the people's courts on behalf of the state. This conference will greatly advance the national procuratorial work.
    People's procuratorial work is an important component of national work. The people's procuratorial organs are an important weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, and their task is to conduct procuratorial oversight of the illegal acts of government agencies, public officials, and the nation's citizens. In the past few years, because we were still in the early stages of nation-building, revolutionary military operations had not completely ended in the mainland for a time, and remnants of counter-revolutionary forces still existed in large numbers and were still very rampant, and land reform in the vast newly liberated areas had not yet been completed. Therefore, we had to rely on military and direct mass action, and adopt the form of military courts and people's courts to rapidly suppress and eliminate the remaining forces of the three major enemies, consolidate the people's democratic regime, and guarantee the restoration and transformation of our country's economy. In this historical stage, it was impossible and should not have been to establish a set of "meticulous and complete" legal system detached from reality to restrain the masses; the organization and work of the People's Procuratorate as the state's legal supervision organ was also not fully and systematically established, but adopted a policy of gradual establishment with a focus, which was completely correct and in line with the actual situation of the country at that time and the needs of the people. Some people do not understand this and have some misconceptions, thinking that procuratorial work is not important, which is wrong. Now that the various social reform movements to eliminate the remnants of the three major enemies have been basically completed, large-scale planned economic construction has begun, and China's first constitution is about to be promulgated, it is both necessary and possible, and therefore completely correct, for the Second National Procuratorial Work Conference to stipulate the universal establishment and improvement of the organization and work of procuratorial organs in a planned and step-by-step manner during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, and this stipulation must be implemented.
    In the past four years, procuratorial work has achieved certain results: procuratorial organs have been established in more than one-third of the administrative units at and above the county level across the country, a group of cadres have been trained, and wherever procuratorial organs have been established, they have cooperated with successive large-scale social reform movements from the perspective of procuratorial work, and combined with the central work of the state in various periods, they have cracked down on various illegal and criminal elements, playing a certain role in guaranteeing national economic construction, protecting the people's democratic rights, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. However, it should also be admitted that the current organizational and operational status of the procuratorial organs is far from meeting the needs of the development of the country's various construction undertakings, especially economic construction. China's socialist revolution, namely socialist transformation, is a more profound and extensive revolution than the new democratic revolution, containing extremely complex and acute struggles. In this struggle, enemies at home and abroad will never sit idly by, and will never be reconciled to their own demise, and will inevitably collude with each other and do everything possible to sabotage our cause. We must continue to use the revolutionary legal system to impose severe suppression on these sabotage activities. In the country's economic construction, it is also necessary to strengthen the protection of state property, protect the legitimate interests of the working class and people of all strata, protect the people's democratic rights, and protect national order, and use the revolutionary legal system to fight against illegal and criminal elements who engage in speculation and profiteering and embezzle and steal state property, fight against illegal and criminal elements who disrupt social order, fight against illegal and criminal elements who violate labor regulations and infringe upon the legitimate interests of the working class, as well as passive怠工, dereliction of duty and other illegal渎职 elements in state organs and production enterprises, and strengthen the supervision of the law-abiding behavior of state organs, state employees and all citizens, and strengthen the awareness of law-abiding behavior of cadres and the masses, in order to guarantee the smooth progress of economic construction. All of these are serious tasks facing procuratorial work, requiring us to further strengthen the construction of procuratorial work in order to cooperate with and supervise public security organs and judicial organs to shoulder these tasks.
    Some people think that since there are supervisory organs, public security organs and courts, there is no need for procuratorial organs anymore. This is because they do not understand the functions of the procuratorial organs. Supervisory organs are administrative supervision organs, and their task is to supervise the implementation of government resolutions by state organs and their staff, as well as illegal acts, dereliction of duty, and violations of administrative discipline in their work. They have no supervisory responsibility for non-state employees, and the sanctions they carry out are administrative sanctions; for those who must be given legal sanctions, they are transferred to the procuratorial organs for procuratorial responsibility. Procuratorial organs and supervisory organs should cooperate closely in their work, but their responsibilities are different. Although procuratorial organs and public security organs and courts have the common task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and punishing crimes , their work is mutually coordinated and mutually constrained. Criminal cases are generally prosecuted first by the procuratorial organs for interrogation, and only if they are found to constitute a crime, they are prosecuted to the court. If the court considers that the evidence in the prosecuted case is insufficient or does not constitute a crime, it may send it back to the procuratorial organ for re-interrogation or declare it not guilty; if the procuratorial organ considers that the court's ruling or judgment is inappropriate, it may also lodge a protest. The working relationship between the public security organs and the procuratorial organs is also the same. When cases investigated and solved by the public security organs need to be prosecuted, they shall be transferred to the procuratorial organs for inspection to decide whether to prosecute or not; if the public security organs disagree with the disposal of the procuratorial organs, they shall raise an objection to the superior procuratorial organs. This judicial system of mutual cooperation and mutual constraint can enable us to avoid subjectivity and one-sidedness in our work, ensure that crimes are punished correctly and effectively, and prevent wrongful arrests and wrongful judgments, and protect the people's democratic rights.
    At present, more than half of the administrative units at and above the county level across the country have not established procuratorial organs, and the system in the field of procuratorial business is very unsound, and experience is still very insufficient. In order to adapt to the needs of the construction of the state's legal system after the promulgation of the Constitution, and in order to complete the tasks of procuratorial work in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational construction and business construction of procuratorial work. In terms of organizational construction, we should first enrich and improve the procuratorial organs above the provincial (municipal) level, and strengthen the people's procuratorates in cities, industrial and mining areas, and focus on establishing specialized people's procuratorates along railways and waterways, so that procuratorial work can penetrate into industrial and mining enterprises and other aspects. In provinces with a good foundation for work, the procuratorial organs of the counties should be generally established and improved as quickly as possible; in provinces with a weak foundation for work, a number of county procuratorial organs should first be established and enriched as the base points for carrying out rural procuratorial work. The qualifications of procuratorial cadres should be that they are politically reliable and have certain work experience and cultural level. In terms of the construction of the procuratorial business system, we must conscientiously sum up past work experience, learn from the advanced experience of Soviet procuratorial work, and in particular, we must vigorously carry out key experiments in procuratorial work, strive to obtain a systematic set of procuratorial work experience within a certain period of time, and establish a backbone team of procuratorial work that is strong in politics and business, in order to prepare conditions for the universal establishment and improvement of procuratorial work. In the past few years, because the People's Procuratorates in many places have not fully recognized the importance of key experiments and have not conscientiously implemented them, they have not yet cultivated a group of local People's Procuratorates that can truly play a base point role, nor have they explored a relatively complete People's Procuratorial work system that is in line with China's actual situation. This situation must be changed quickly.
    While carrying out the above-mentioned organizational construction and business construction, the People's Procuratorates at all levels must also strengthen the political and ideological education of cadres, and continuously improve the ideological awareness, policy level and work ability of cadres. This first requires the procuratorial cadres to establish a clear understanding of serving the overall task of the country and safeguarding the dignity of the state's laws and regulations, so that they understand that the People's Procuratorate can only closely combine with the central work of the time and place, and use the weapon of the People's Procuratorial work, and make achievements in work through the inspection of major cases, in order to gain the trust and support of the people, and create favorable conditions for the further development of the People's Procuratorial work. When the People's Procuratorial organs examine and handle cases and carry out other work, they must distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish between right and wrong, distinguish between the side that should be attacked and the side that should be protected, and prevent the phenomenon of handling cases in isolation without proceeding from policies and the overall situation. On the one hand, we must fight relentlessly against all illegal and criminal phenomena, and on the other hand, we must prevent and correct any privileged ideas of being a "supervisor". We should adopt a working attitude of unity and cooperation with relevant departments, humility and prudence, prevent high-mindedness and detachment from the masses and reality, establish a working method of proceeding from reality, seeking truth from facts, relying on the masses, and conducting investigation and research. Only in this way can we accurately and correctly crack down on various illegal and criminal acts, educate the people of the whole country and state organs and personnel to earnestly abide by the state's laws, decrees, and various policies, so that the People's Procuratorate can truly become a powerful assistant to the party and government leading organs in the struggle against illegal and undisciplined behavior and a guardian of the state's laws and disciplines.

### 加强检察工作保障国家建设

    加强检察工作保障国家建设
    第二届全国检察工作会议，根据党和国家在过渡时期的总任务，检查总结了过去的工作，规定了今后检察工作的方针。这就是在国家第一个五年建设计划的时期内，根据需要和可能，有计划有步骤地把全国各级人民检察署的组织和工作系统地建立和健全起来，运用人民民主法制，从检察工作方面保障国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、对手工业、对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的实现，向一切反革命分子及各种危害经济建设、危害社会主义改造、危害国家秩序的违法犯罪分子进行斗争，检察所有国民包括国家工作人员在内的违法犯罪案件，并代表国家向人民法院提起公诉。这次会议将把全国检察工作大大地向前推进一步。
    人民检察工作是国家工作中的一个重要组成部分。人民检察机关是人民民主专政的重要武器，它的任务是对政府机关、公务人员和全国国民的违法行为实行检察。过去几年来，由于我们尚处在建国的初期，有一时期革命军事行动在大陆上还没有完全结束，反革命残余势力还大量地存在着，并且还很猖狂，广大新解放区的土地改革尚未完成，所以必须依靠军事和群众的直接行动，并采取军事法庭、人民法庭的形式来迅速镇压和消灭三大敌人的残余势力，巩固人民民主政权，保障我国经济的恢复和改造工作。在这一历史阶段中，不可能也不应该建立一套脱离实际的“细密完备”的法制，以束缚群众的手足；作为国家法律监督机关的人民检察署的组织和工作，也就没有全面地系统地建立起来，而采取了有重点地逐步建立的方针，这是完全正确的，符合于当时国家的实际情况和人民群众的需要的。有的人不了解这一点，产生了一些错觉，认为检察工作不重要，这是错误的。现在，肃清三大敌人残余势力的各项社会改革运动已经基本完成，大规模的有计划的经济建设已经开始，我国第一个宪法即将颁布，在这样的情况下，第二届全国检察工作会议规定在第一个五年建设计划的时期内有计划有步骤地普遍建立和健全检察机关的组织与工作，是既必要而又可能的，因而也是完全正确的，这一规定必须加以贯彻实现。
    四年来，检察工作已经取得了一定的成绩：在全国三分之一以上的县级以上的行政单位中建立了检察机构，培养了一部分干部，凡是检察机关已经建立了的地方，都从检察工作方面配合了历次大规模的社会改革运动，并结合国家在各时期的中心工作打击了各种违法和犯罪的分子，在保障国家经济建设、保护人民民主权利、巩固人民民主专政上起了一定的作用。但是也应该承认，目前检察机关的组织与工作状况，还远不能适应国家各项建设工作特别是经济建设工作发展的需要。我国的社会主义革命即社会主义改造，是一个比新民主主义革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。在这场斗争中，国内外敌人决不会袖手旁观，决不会甘心于自己的死亡，必然要相互勾结起来，千方百计破坏我们的事业。对于这些破坏活动，我们必须运用革命法制继续施以严厉的镇压。在国家的经济建设中，还必须加强保护国家财产，保护工人阶级及各阶层人民的合法利益，保护人民的民主权利，保护国家秩序，运用革命法制向投机倒把和贪污盗窃国家财产的违法犯罪分子进行斗争，向破坏社会秩序的违法犯罪分子进行斗争，向违反劳动法规、侵害工人阶级合法利益的违法犯罪分子以及在国家机关和生产事业中的消极怠工，玩忽职守的违法渎职分子进行斗争，要加强对国家机关、国家工作人员和全体国民守法的监督，加强干部和群众的守法观念，才能保障经济建设的顺利进行。所有这些，都是摆在检察工作面前的严重任务，要求我们进一步加强检察工作的建设，以便配合和监督公安机关和审判机关，担负起这些任务。
    有些人认为既然有了监察机关、公安机关和法院，就可以不必再要检察机关了。这是由于不了解检察机关的性能的缘故。监察机关是行政监督机关，其任务是监督国家机关和工作人员对政府决议执行情况及工作中的违法失职与违犯行政纪律的行为，它对非国家工作人员没有监督责任，它所执行的处分是行政处分；对于必须给予法律处分的则移交检察机关负责检察。检察机关和监察机关在工作中要密切配合，但其职责是不相同的。检察机关和公安机关、法院虽负有共同的镇压反革命、惩治犯罪的任务，但它们的工作是互相配合而又互相制约的。刑事案件的起诉一般是先由检察机关进行侦讯，认为构成犯罪的才向法院起诉。法院认为起诉的案件证据不足或未构成犯罪时，可发还检察机关重新侦讯或宣告无罪；检察机关认为法院的裁定或判决不当时，还可以提出抗告。公安机关和检察机关的工作关系也是如此。公安机关侦察破获的案件需要起诉时，要移送检察机关检查，决定起诉或不起诉；公安机关对于检察机关的处置不同意时，则向上级检察机关提出异议。这种互相配合而又互相制约的司法制度，可以使我们避免工作中的主观性和片面性，保证正确地有效地惩罚犯罪，并防止错押、错判现象，保护人民的民主权利。
    目前全国还有过半数的县级以上的行政单位没有建立起检察机构，在检察业务方面的制度还很不健全，经验还很不足。为了适应在宪法颁布后国家法制建设的需要，为了完成今后检察工作的任务，必须加强检察工作的组织建设与业务建设。在组织建设方面，目前应首先充实与健全省（市）以上的检察机构，并加强城市、工矿区人民检察署和有重点地建立铁路水运沿线的专门人民检察署，使检察工作深入到工矿企业等方面中去。在工作基础较好的省，应尽可能地以较快的速度普遍建立和健全县的检察机构；在工作基础较弱的省，应首先建立和充实若干县的检察机构，作为开展农村检察工作的基点。检察干部的条件，应该选择政治上可靠、有一定工作经验和文化水平的干部充任。在检察业务制度的建设方面，要认真总结过去的工作经验，学习苏联检察工作的先进经验，特别是要大力进行检察工作的重点试验，争取在一定时期内，取得一套系统的检察工作经验，建立一支在政治上业务上坚强的检察工作的骨干队伍，为检察工作的普遍建立和健全准备条件。过去几年中，由于许多地方的人民检察署没有充分认识重点试验的重要性，没有认真地贯彻执行，因而直到现在尚未培植出一批真正能起基点作用的地方人民检察署，也没有摸索出一套比较完整的切合我国实际情况的人民检察工作制度。这种情况必须迅速改变。
    各级人民检察署在进行上述组织建设和业务建设的同时，还必须加强对干部的政治思想教育，不断地提高干部的思想觉悟、政策水平和工作能力。这首先是要求在检察干部中树立起为国家总任务服务和维护国家法纪尊严的明确的思想，使他们懂得人民检察署只有紧密地结合当时当地的中心工作，运用人民检察工作的武器，通过对重大的案件的检察，在工作上做出成绩来，才能获得人民群众的信任和拥护，为人民检察工作的进一步开展创造有利条件。人民检察机关在检察处理案件和进行其他工作时，必须分清敌我界限，分清是非轻重，分清应该打击的一面和应该保护的一面，防止不从政策和全面情况出发、孤立地就案办案的现象。一方面要无情地与一切违法犯罪现象作斗争，另方面也要防止和纠正任何以“监督者”自居的特权思想。应该采取与有关部门团结合作，谦虚谨慎的工作态度，防止好高鹜远、脱离群众、脱离实际的主观主义，树立从实际出发，实事求是，依靠群众，调查研究的工作方法。只有这样，才能准确无误地打击各种违法犯罪行为，教育全国人民和国家机关人员切实遵守国家的法律、法令和各种政策，使人民检察署真正成为党政领导机关反对违法乱纪斗争的有力助手和国家法纪的保卫者。
