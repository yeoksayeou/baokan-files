Primary School Graduates in Southwest China Actively Participate in Agricultural Production

Primary school graduates in Southwest China are enthusiastically participating in agricultural production labor, and they are playing a very good role in rural work. Last year, 177 primary school graduates in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, participated in agricultural production labor; 18 primary school graduates in Tuanjie Village, Beibei, participated in agricultural production. Among the eleven primary school graduates from Sifang Village, Xinglong Township, Fuling County, Sichuan Province, in the past two years, two were admitted to junior high school, and the remaining nine participated in agricultural labor. Many of them have become "experts" in agricultural production. Whether it is plowing, harrowing, sowing, transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting grain, or threshing, they can do it all. Some have been selected as leaders and deputy leaders of mutual aid teams, accountants of cooperatives, winter school teachers, and production team leaders of agricultural production cooperatives. Farmers say: With literate people, there is no need to worry about learning advanced production technology.

Many primary school graduates have played a significant role in their labor and work. Yang Jinming, the leader of the 13th Mutual Aid Team in Tuanjie Village, Beibei, not only actively leads all team members in farming but also leads them in political and cultural studies. The mutual aid team led by Yang Mingjun has become the best mutual aid team in the village. Tan Changmei is the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Tuanjie Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. The League organization she leads has played a role in various political movements. Jiang Chengchun, a primary school graduate from Anshun County, Guizhou Province, actively mobilized his father to sell 1,700 jin of surplus grain to the state when the People's Government purchased surplus grain.

    西南各地高小毕业生积极参加农业生产
    西南各地的高小毕业生，踊跃参加农业生产劳动，他们在农村工作中发挥了很好的作用。云南宜良县去年有一百七十七个高小毕业生参加了农业生产劳动；北碚团结村参加农业生产的高小毕业生有十八个。四川涪陵县兴隆乡四方村前年和去年的高小毕业生共十一人，其中有二人升入了初级中学，其余九人都参加了农业劳动。他们中有不少已成为农业生产的“内行”人，无论犁田、耙田、播种、插秧、割谷或打场，样样都能作；有的已被选为互助组的组长、副组长，合作社的会计，冬学教师，农业生产合作社的生产队长。农民们反映：有了识字的人，要学习先进生产技术就不愁了。
    许多高小毕业生在劳动和工作中发挥了很大作用。北碚团结村十三互助组组长杨进明，除积极领导全体组员耕作外，还领导他们进行政治、文化学习；杨明俊领导的互助组，已成为全村最好的一个互助组；谭昌美是团结村农业生产合作社的团支部书记，在各项政治运动中，她所领导的团组织都起了作用。贵州安顺县小学毕业生蒋成纯，在人民政府收购余粮时，积极动员父亲把一千七百斤余粮卖给了国家。 （甘泉）
