    Mountain Road Construction Completed in the Yao Autonomous Region of Liannan, Northern Guangdong

    The mountain road in the Yao Autonomous Region of Liannan, Northern Guangdong, was completed in early February this year. This road was built with funds allocated by the Central People's Government. The entire project commenced in September of last year. During the construction, Han farmers actively assisted the road construction workers, completing the entire project in just over five months and saving 600 million yuan in construction costs.

    In the past, due to inconvenient transportation in the mountainous area of Liannan, the Yao people often had to carry goods over mountains; transporting fir trees was even more difficult. For example, to transport fir trees from the First District to Zhaigang Market, they had to be pushed down the steep Mei'ao mountain. The mountainous area's abundant local products, such as gambier, tung oil, tea oil, tea leaves, maize, and cotton, often became waste because they could not be transported out. Light industrial products from other areas also could not be easily transported into the mountainous area; the Yao people had to exchange one catty of ginger for one tael of salt. Now, this situation has fundamentally changed. Local products can be transported by ox cart along the mountain road to Sanjiang Market (the location of the People's Government of the Yao Autonomous Region of Liannan) or Zhaigang Market, and sold to the local product purchasing stations of the Guangdong Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company. Moreover, the journey has been shortened. After the completion of the mountain road, the Liannan Cooperative General Society has established nineteen distribution stations in sixteen townships; the Guangdong Branch of Xinhua Bookstore is preparing to establish a branch in Sanjiang Market to supply cultural nourishment to the Yao people.

    粤北连南瑶族自治区
    山区大道修筑完工
    粤北连南瑶族自治区山区大道已于今年二月上旬筑成。这条道路是由中央人民政府拨款修建的。全部工程于去年九月动工。在修建中，汉族农民积极协助筑路工人，以五个多月的时间完成了全部工程，并节省了六亿元工程费。
    过去，连南山区由于交通不便，瑶族人民常常背着货物爬山越岭；运送杉木更是困难重重。如由第一区把杉木运往寨岗墟，就得把它们由峻陡的梅坳沿山推下。山区盛产的土特产如薯莨、桐油、茶油、茶叶、包粟及棉花等，因运不出去有不少成了废物。外地的轻工业品也不能很好地运进山区，瑶族人民必须用一斤姜才能换得一两盐。现在，这样的情况已根本改变了。土特产可由山区大道用牛车运往三江墟（连南瑶族自治区人民政府所在地）或寨岗墟，出售给中国土产公司广东省公司的土产收购站。而且路程也缩短了。山区大道建成后，连南合作总社已在十六个乡设立了十九个分销站；新华书店广东分店正在三江墟筹设支店，以便将文化食粮供应给瑶族人民。
