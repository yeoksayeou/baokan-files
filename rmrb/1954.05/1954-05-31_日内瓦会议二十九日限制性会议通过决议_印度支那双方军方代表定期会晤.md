Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 29th: After the publication of the communique on the first agreement reached at the Geneva Conference's secret meeting on the afternoon of the 29th regarding measures to promote an early and simultaneous cessation of the war in Indochina, the atmosphere here is extremely excited. In front of the notice board at the "Press House," reporters from various countries covering the conference news crowded together, vying to see the conference communique. Many reporters were also transcribing it verbatim. At dusk, radio stations throughout Europe broadcast the news that the conference had reached its first agreement.

At 8 p.m., the spokesman for the Soviet delegation held a press conference at the "Press House." The conference room was packed with journalists, and the atmosphere was exceptionally enthusiastic.

Observers here believe that the reaching of this agreement has a positive and active significance for the discussion of restoring peace in Indochina; at the same time, this agreement is also another setback for the forces opposing peaceful negotiation and obstructing the conference's progress.

    日内瓦会议二十九日限制性会议通过决议
    印度支那双方军方代表定期会晤
    【新华社日内瓦二十九日电】参加日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题讨论的九个国家的代表团二十九日下午举行了限制性的会议后发表公报如下：九国代表团在五月二十九日举行限制性会议，继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。会议通过了英国代表团所提出的建议。该决议全文如下：
    为了促使敌对行动的早日和同时终止，兹建议：
    甲、双方司令部的代表应即在日内瓦会晤，在当地亦应开始接触。
    乙、他们应研究在停止敌对行动后军队的部署问题，此项研究应从在越南的重新集结地区问题开始。
    丙、他们应尽快地向会议提出报告和建议。
    双方司令部代表的会晤日期将在六月一日以前确定。
    下次限制性会议将于五月三十一日举行。
   【新华社日内瓦二十九日电】日内瓦会议二十九日下午秘密会议上关于促进早日和同时停止印度支那战争的措施的首次协议的公报发表后，此间人心极为兴奋。在“记者之家”公告栏前，来自各国采访会议新闻的记者们拥挤在一起，争看会议公报。有许多记者并在逐字抄录。黄昏时分，欧洲各地电台都广播了会议取得了第一个协议的消息。
    下午八时，苏联代表团发言人在“记者之家”举行了记者招待会。会议室内挤满了新闻记者，情绪异常热烈。
    此间观察家认为：这一协议的达成对于恢复印度支那和平的讨论有着肯定的积极意义；同时，这一协议也是反对和平协商、阻挠会议进行的势力的又一个挫折。
