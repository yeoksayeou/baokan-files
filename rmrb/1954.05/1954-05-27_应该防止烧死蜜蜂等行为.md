    Actions Like Burning Bees Should Be Prevented
    A letter from the General Agricultural Production Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture: It has been learned that since 1951, in areas with more beekeeping in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces, farmers or district and township (village) cadres have frequently obstructed beekeeping and even burned bees. After our research, the reasons for the above situation are: some district and township cadres and farmers lack a correct understanding of the relationship between bees and crops, and think that bees will damage crops; some farmers are afraid that there are too many bees, and people and animals will be stung by bees when they go to the fields to cultivate. In addition, some beekeepers have a bad attitude when they go to the countryside to keep bees, which aroused farmers' dissatisfaction. This situation has affected the development of beekeeping.
    Bees are not pests that harm crops, but beneficial insects that are good for both industrial and agricultural production. When bees collect honey, they can spread pollen. For most fruit trees and cross-pollinated crops such as cotton, buckwheat, sunflowers, and melons, they are not only harmless, but also can play a certain role in increasing production. According to Soviet experiments, pollination with trained bees can increase cucumber production by more than double; a group of ordinary bees is equivalent to the pollination work of fifty-two people. According to the experience of Shanxi Province, many pear trees that had not produced fruit for many years due to lack of pollination bore fruit due to the pollination of bees. In addition, honey contains a large amount of glucose and fructose. In addition to being directly consumed, it can also be used to make pastries, cosmetics, and medicinal materials; beeswax can also be used as an industrial raw material. China has a vast area, a mild climate, and extremely rich honey source plants. If beekeeping is used as a rural sideline, it will be beneficial to increase the unit area yield of crops and the income of honey and wax. Therefore, rural work cadres in various places should correctly understand the role of beekeeping, and publicize the relationship between bees and crop production to the farmers; in areas with more beekeepers, appropriate arrangements should be made for beekeeping to avoid excessive concentration, which affects the field operations of farmers. When beekeepers go to the countryside to keep bees, they should patiently publicize the benefits of bees to the farmers, and contact the local district and township (village) government in advance to avoid misunderstandings and disputes.

### 应该防止烧死蜜蜂等行为

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该防止烧死蜜蜂等行为
    中央农业部农业生产总局来信：据了解，从一九五一年起，江苏、浙江、河北、河南、湖北等省养蜂较多的地区经常发生农民或区、乡（村）干部阻挠放蜂甚至烧蜂的事件。经我们研究，发生以上情况的原因是：部分区、乡干部及农民对于蜜蜂与农作物的关系缺乏正确的认识，以为蜜蜂会咬坏农作物；有些农民怕蜜蜂过多，人畜下田耕作会被蜜蜂刺伤。此外，还有一些养蜂者下乡放蜂时态度不好，引起农民不满。这种情况影响了养蜂事业的发展。
    蜜蜂并不是有害农作物的虫类，而是对工、农业生产都有好处的益虫。蜜蜂在采蜜的时候可以传播花粉，对于大多数果树和棉花、荞麦、向日葵、瓜类等异花授粉作物不但没有害处，还能起一定的增产作用。根据苏联试验，用训练过的蜜蜂授粉，可使黄瓜增产一倍以上；一群普通蜜蜂相当于五十二人的授粉工作。根据山西省经验，很多因未配植授粉而多年不结果的梨树，由于蜜蜂的授粉作用而结了果。此外，蜂蜜含有多量的葡萄糖及果糖，除供直接食用外，并可用来制糕点、化装品及药料；蜂蜡还可作工业原料。我国地区辽阔，气候温和，蜜源植物极为丰富，如果把养蜂作为农村副业，对于增加农作物的单位面积产量及蜜、蜡的收入是有利的。因此，各地农村工作干部应该正确认识养蜂业的作用，并向农民群众宣传蜜蜂对于农作物增产的关系；在养蜂者较多的地区，对放蜂应作适当的安排，避免过分集中，影响农民的田间操作。养蜂者下乡放蜂时，应耐心地向农民宣传蜜蜂的好处，并在事先和当地区、乡（村）政府取得联系，以免发生误会，引起纠纷。
