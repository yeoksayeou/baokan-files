Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: Vietnam News Agency, May 22nd: "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast an article exposing the French conspiracy in evacuating the wounded and captured of the French Expeditionary Force from Dien Bien Phu. The article said:

	After the complete elimination of the French army at Dien Bien Phu by the People's Army, in order to implement the humanitarian policy of President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army decided to release the wounded and captured French soldiers at Dien Bien Phu, and notified the French General Command that it could send representatives to accept the conditions and methods for evacuating the wounded and captured.

	Therefore, the evacuation of the wounded and captured French soldiers from Dien Bien Phu is a release of the wounded and captured by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, not an exchange of wounded and captured between the two sides. The method of evacuation is subject to the conditions stipulated by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army. The French General Command is not qualified to forcibly propose this or that condition to the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army.

	However, the French General Command painstakingly resorted to tricks in an attempt to cover up its behavior of violating the agreements reached by both sides. It suggested using aircraft to help the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army evacuate the wounded soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army, and requested the establishment of a mixed committee to supervise the process on Highway 41 connecting Dien Bien Phu and Son La.

	It is truly absurd and ridiculous that just as hundreds of wounded and captured soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force were anxiously waiting for evacuation in Dien Bien Phu, the French General Command suggested helping to transport the wounded soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army.

	In fact, the Vietnam People's Army does not lack transportation to transport its wounded soldiers. Moreover, Highway 41 is located in the liberated area and is controlled by the Vietnam People's Army. Therefore, the Vietnam People's Army has the right to transport its wounded soldiers and escort prisoners of war on this highway on its own. The French General Command has no right to demand supervision of this highway, especially after the French forces in Lai Chau and Dien Bien Phu were completely annihilated by the Vietnam People's Army.

	Currently, hundreds of wounded and captured soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force in Dien Bien Phu are carefully cared for by the Vietnam People's Army, and their food and medicine are mainly supplied by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The medical personnel of the Vietnam People's Army are making their best efforts to treat and assist the wounded and captured. However, the French General Command violated the agreements reached by both sides and dispatched aircraft to bomb and strafe Highway 41, on which thousands of wounded and captured soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force are now being escorted to prisoner-of-war camps.

	In the face of world public opinion, and in the face of the opinion of the French people, the French General Command can absolutely not cover up its behavior of violating the agreement. As the spokesperson of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attending the Geneva Conference pointed out at a press conference in Geneva on May 18, the French General Command is trying every means to delay the evacuation of the wounded and captured soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force, because they fear that once the wounded and captured French soldiers return, they will reveal the truth about the lenient policy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the disastrous defeat of the French army at Dien Bien Phu.

### “越南之声”电台  揭露法国在撤运奠边府伤俘工作上的阴谋

    揭露法国在撤运奠边府伤俘工作上的阴谋
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社二十二日讯：“越南之声”电台广播了一篇文章，揭露法国在撤运奠边府法国远征军伤俘工作上的阴谋。文章说：
    在奠边府被人民军完全拔除以后，为了执行胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的人道政策，越南人民军总司令部决定释放奠边府法军伤俘，并通知法军总司令部说，它可以派遣代表前来接受关于撤运伤俘的条件和方式。
    因此，撤运奠边府的法军伤俘是越南人民军总司令部释放伤俘，而不是双方交换伤俘。关于撤运的方式，是越南人民军总司令部规定的条件。法军总司令部没有资格向越南人民军总司令部强行提出这个或那个条件。
    然而，法军总司令部处心积虑地玩弄手段，企图掩饰它的违反双方所达成的协议的行径。它建议用飞机帮助越南人民军总司令部撤运越南人民军的伤员，并要求建立混合委员会在连接奠边府和山萝的第四十一号公路上进行监督。
    正当数以百计的法国远征军伤俘在奠边府焦急地等候撤运的时候，法军总司令部却建议帮助运输越南人民军的伤员，这真是荒谬可笑的事。
    实际上，越南人民军并不缺少运输它的伤员的运输工具。而且第四十一号公路是在解放区内并为越南人民军所控制。因此，越南人民军有权力在这条公路上自行运输它的伤员和护送战俘。法军总司令部没有权力要求对这条公路进行监督，尤其是在莱州和奠边府的法军被越南人民军完全歼灭以后。
    目前，奠边府法国远征军数以百计的伤俘都由越南人民军仔细地加以看护，他们的粮食和医药主要都是由越南民主共和国政府供给的。越南人民军的医务人员正在尽最大的努力来治疗和援助伤俘。但是法军总司令部却违反了双方所达成的协议，派遣飞机轰炸和扫射第四十一号公路，那条公路上现在正有法国远征军成千的伤俘被护送到伤俘营地去。
    在世界舆论的面前，在法国人民的舆论面前，法军总司令部绝对掩饰不了它的违反协议的行径。诚如越南民主共和国出席日内瓦会议代表团发言人五月十八日在日内瓦举行记者招待会时指出的，法军总司令部在想尽一切方法拖延法国远征军的伤俘的撤运工作，因为他们害怕法军伤俘一旦回去以后，就会透露关于越南民主共和国政府的宽大政策以及法军在奠边府惨败的真相。
