Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 3rd: The Geneva Conference continued its discussion on the Korean issue on the afternoon of the 3rd, with British representative Eden serving as chairman.

After announcing the start of the meeting, Eden declared that he had received a telegram from the Chairman of the Southeast Asian Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference—the Prime Minister of Ceylon—which extracted the part of the Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference communiqué regarding the Indochina issue and requested that the telegram be distributed to the delegations of all countries participating in the Geneva Conference. Eden announced that he would distribute the telegram to the delegations of all countries after the meeting.

The first to speak was South Korea's Pyun Yung-tai. In his speech, Pyun Yung-tai dared not touch upon the substantive issue of peaceful reunification of Korea, but only spread despicable slanders that were not worth refuting. He once again opposed the suggestions of DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il, insisting on expanding the South Korean regime to the entire Korean peninsula. Pyun Yung-tai attempted to defend the illegal elections held by the "United Nations" in South Korea, but he had to admit that the elections in South Korea were held under police suppression. He futilely attempted to sow discord in the unbreakable fraternal friendship between Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and repeated the discredited American rhetoric, vehemently slandering the peaceful foreign policy of China and the Soviet Union.

Pyun Yung-tai blatantly exposed himself as a traitor to the Korean nation. He was so shameless as to say that what he needed and liked was American intervention, that he needed America to feed him when he was hungry and clothe him when he was cold. He said his only dissatisfaction was that American intervention in Korea was not enough, and he hoped for more American intervention.

DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il then spoke (full text to be published separately). Nam Il further explained the suggestions he had put forward regarding the restoration of Korea's national unification and the holding of free all-Korean elections. He also pointed out that Pyun Yung-tai's crazy speech today was not worth refuting. He said: Pyun Yung-tai's speech is of no help to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

After a fifteen-minute break, Greek representative Stefan Stephanopoulos spoke. He merely repeated Dulles' rhetoric without any new content.

Chief representative of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai then spoke (full text to be published separately). Zhou Enlai expressed his support for Foreign Minister Nam Il's speech and once again pointed out that Nam Il's suggestions should serve as the basis for the conference to reach an agreement.

Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech: The Geneva Conference cannot avoid the issue of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice that has not yet been resolved. He said: The act of the United States and the Republic of Korea authorities in forcibly detaining more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war is a serious violation of the Geneva Convention and the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to resolve this issue through reasonable channels, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, with the consent of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, hereby suggests:

　　1. Measures must be taken to ensure that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained and incorporated into the army in June 1953 and January 1954 can return to their motherland.

　　2. A committee composed of representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea shall be formed to assist in the implementation of the measures stipulated in the preceding paragraph for the repatriation of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

　　3. Before the issue of prisoners of war is dealt with by the aforementioned committee, a joint group composed of representatives of the Red Cross societies of the countries concerned on both sides of the Korean armistice shall go to the current location of the prisoners of war to conduct inspections.

After Zhou Enlai finished speaking, the meeting adjourned at 6:25 pm and will continue tomorrow afternoon.

    日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
    周外长就战俘问题提出建议
    南日对朝鲜问题的建议作了进一步说明
    据新华社日内瓦三日电：日内瓦会议三日下午继续讨论朝鲜问题，由英国代表艾登担任主席。
    艾登在宣布开会以后，宣称他收到了东南亚五国——印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、缅甸、锡兰——总理会议主席锡兰总理给他的一份电报，这份电报摘引了五国总理会议公报中关于印度支那问题的部分，并要求将这份电报散发给参加日内瓦会议的各国代表团。艾登宣布他将在会后把这份电报散发给各国代表团。
    第一个发言的是南朝鲜的卞荣泰。卞荣泰在发言中丝毫不敢涉及朝鲜和平统一的实质问题，只是一味散播不值一驳的卑鄙诽谤。他再次反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日的建议，坚持把南朝鲜的政权扩大到全朝鲜。卞荣泰企图为“联合国”在南朝鲜举行的非法选举辩护，可是他又不得不承认南朝鲜的选举是在警察镇压之下举行的。他徒劳无功地企图挑拨朝、中、苏三国之间的牢不可破的兄弟般的友好关系，并且重复早被驳倒了的美国论调，大肆诬蔑中、苏两国的和平外交政策。
    卞荣泰赤裸裸地暴露他是朝鲜民族的叛徒，他不知羞耻到如此田地，竟然说他需要和喜欢的正是美国的干涉，需要美国在他饿的时候给他吃，在他冷的时候给他穿。他说他唯一不满的是美国干涉朝鲜还不够，希望美国更多的干涉。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日接着发言（全文另发）。南日对他所提出的关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜的自由选举的建议作了进一步的说明。他并且指出卞荣泰今天的疯狂的发言是不值一驳的。他说：卞荣泰的发言对于和平解决朝鲜问题是毫无帮助的。
    在休息十五分钟之后，希腊代表斯特凡·斯特凡诺普洛斯发言。他只是重复杜勒斯的论调，毫无新的内容。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来接着发言（全文另发）。周恩来表示支持南日外务相的发言，再一次指出，南日的建议应该作为会议达成协议的基础。
    周恩来的发言中指出：日内瓦会议不能避开朝鲜停战中至今尚未了结的战俘问题。他说：美国和大韩民国当局强迫扣留四万八千余名朝中被俘人员的行为，是严重违反日内瓦公约和朝鲜停战协定的。为经由合理途径解决这一问题，中华人民共和国代表团在商得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的同意后，兹特建议：
    一、必须采取措施：保证一九五三年六月和一九五四年一月被强迫扣留并编入军队的朝中被俘人员得以重返祖国。
    二、由美国、联合王国、法国、中华人民共和国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的代表组成委员会，以协助实现前项所规定的遣返朝中被俘人员的措施。
    三、在战俘问题未经上述委员会处理前，由朝鲜停战缔约双方有关国家的红十字会代表组成联合小组，前往战俘现在所在地点，进行视察。
    在周恩来发言完毕以后，会议于下午六时二十五分宣告休会，将于四日下午继续举行。
