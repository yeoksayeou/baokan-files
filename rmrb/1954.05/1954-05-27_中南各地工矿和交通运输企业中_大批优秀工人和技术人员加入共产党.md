In industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in Central and Southern China, a large number of excellent workers have joined the Communist Party in the past year. According to statistics from the end of 1953, the number of worker Party members in the entire region increased fourfold compared to June 1952. On average, one out of every fifteen industrial workers is a Communist Party member.

In the first quarter of this year, among the 1,321 new Party members developed in Wuhan, 856 were workers, including 481 skilled workers. Skilled workers accounted for 36.4% of the total number of Party members admitted in the city in the first quarter.
