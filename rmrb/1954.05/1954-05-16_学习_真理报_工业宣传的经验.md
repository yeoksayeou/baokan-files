Learning from “Pravda’s” Experience in Industrial Propaganda
　　Zhang Pei
　　The Task of Industrial Propaganda

　　Starting with the First Five-Year Plan, a large-scale socialist construction was launched throughout the Soviet Union, particularly the construction of heavy industry. During this period, the main focus of "Pravda's" industrial propaganda was: to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of millions of people to overfulfill the state's plans. This was the political aim and political task of the newspaper's industrial propaganda.

　　During our visit to "Pravda," we gained the following insights into "Pravda's" economic propaganda, especially its industrial propaganda. First, economic propaganda should particularly emphasize propaganda through human activities, especially the importance of publicizing advanced producers. This is because people are the main productive force of society, and it is people who are using the tools of production to realize material production; and the improvement of technological level, the improvement of production organization, and the application of science, all depend on people's production experience and labor ability. However, while "Pravda" attaches importance to publicizing the ideas, creative spirit, and other human activities of advanced innovators, it also pays special attention to publicizing the role of the Party and the decisive role of the masses, and avoids prolonged entanglement with a few advanced producers in the propaganda, and prevents the tendency to exaggerate individual roles. Second, the propaganda should clarify that the fundamental purpose of economic construction is to improve the material and cultural life of the workers, not economic propaganda for the sake of economic propaganda. Third, economic propaganda must touch on many practical issues in economic work, such as the invention and creation of new technologies and methods, design, and materials. Newspapers cannot avoid these issues, because they are raised in life. However, newspapers should not talk about the details of specialized technologies and business methods, but should combine the political tasks of industrialization to make the most important practical issues of production technology and economic business as easy to understand as possible. "Pravda's" required standard is that not only ordinary workers, but also collective farmers should be able to understand it. Fourth, economic propaganda must have a focus. During the first and second five-year plans in the Soviet Union, "Pravda's" economic propaganda accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the entire layout, and it used special pages and special columns to achieve concentration, prominence, and continuity, so that "the most important current issues could never leave the pages of the newspaper." At the same time, there was also a focus on regions. During the first five-year plan, "Pravda" had resident editorial departments in key construction projects such as the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the tractor factories in Stalingrad and Kharkov, the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant, the Turkestan-Siberia Railway, and the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Plant.

　　From the above situation, it can be seen that "Pravda's" industrial propaganda is closely combined with industrial issues, but it is not just conducting industrial propaganda on industrial issues. Rather, it has clear political aims and political tasks.

　　Main Contents of Industrial Propaganda

　　The main contents of "Pravda's" industrial propaganda can be divided into three aspects:

　　First, mobilizing the internal potential of enterprises. This is a very important part of newspaper industrial propaganda.

　　"Pravda" has always emphasized this guiding ideology in its industrial propaganda: it is wrong to think that increasing production can only be achieved by increasing the number of workers. At the same time, it is also wrong to think that increasing the intensity of physical labor can increase production. A factory should have the necessary number of workers and technicians, but this does not mean that the number of workers can be more than actually needed, or that workers can exhaust their physical strength. The great Russian military scientist Suvorov said: Defeat the enemy not with numbers, but with skill. Labor should also rely on skill rather than quantity. Therefore, production should be organized in such a way that fewer people, consuming less physical strength and materials, can produce more and better products. This is the highly efficient and highly intelligent socialist labor. "Pravda" calls on people to engage in this kind of intelligent labor, and calls on people to make good use of the internal potential of enterprises.

　　How does "Pravda" fight to utilize the internal potential of enterprises? The main thing is to study, summarize, and promote the experiences of advanced producers. The first thing to note is to let production innovators speak for themselves in the newspaper. In 1953 alone, "Pravda" published 68 articles written by advanced producers themselves, most of which were accompanied by their own photos and published on the first page. In addition, "Pravda" also invited some writers to write features to introduce advanced producers. It also invited some experts, scholars, factory directors, and Party committee secretaries to write special articles with analysis and criticism based on the characteristics of different departments, in order to systematize and rationalize these many advanced experiences. Secondly, it uses the form of special pages to focus on and highlight the experience of advanced producers. Special page propaganda is an important method for promoting advanced experience, and it can have various contents. Taking the special pages published by "Pravda" in 1953 as an example, there are special pages for publicizing and promoting the improvement of labor productivity. Under the general title of "Improving Labor Productivity on the Basis of High Technology is the Main Guarantee of Our Achievements," articles were published by steelworkers, Estonian textile workers, excavator operators on the Ural Canal construction site, factory directors in Moscow, coal mining drivers in the Donbass, and heads of farming groups in a collective farm, as well as an essay by Goroshikin, secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, on "Socialist Competition." In addition, an editorial "Resolutely Increase Labor Productivity" was published on the first page, comprehensively analyzing and summarizing the various advanced experiences in the special pages. There are special pages on reducing production costs, such as the introduction of the experience of reducing production costs at the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City under the general title of "Reducing Costs is the Way to Vigorously Improve the Lives of Workers." The special page published articles by the Party committee secretary, chief engineer, chief accountant, and foreman, published charts illustrating the cost reduction situation, and also published an editorial. There are special pages focusing on technical issues such as mechanization and automation, but these technical special pages do not discuss technical details that most people cannot understand. There are special pages on the competition to "Better Utilize Production Sites." This was a new competition movement that emerged in the Soviet Union last winter. Using this method to tap potential can increase production without building new factories, so as to avoid building too many factories in large cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, which would affect the health of residents; and it can also save a lot of building materials, manpower, and funds, which can be used to build houses. Under the general title of "Produce More Products on Every Square Meter of Land!" "Pravda" introduced the advanced experience of the Moscow Bulb Factory and also published an editorial.

　　Two issues need to be noted here. One is that in measuring the effectiveness and practical value of an advanced experience, the economic effects should be specifically considered. If it is a steelworker's suggestion, it should be seen how much steel he actually produced, and how much more than other workers produced in the same time; if it is an advanced experience of a construction worker, it should be seen how fast his construction speed is, etc. In making this evaluation, the relevant Party organizations, industrial authorities, and trade unions should be relied on, and their opinions should be listened to. The other is that it is impossible for the newspaper to publish all advanced experiences. "Pravda's" approach is not to publish specific, individual, or suggestions related only to a certain production department in a few places. These can be published in factory wall newspapers, local newspapers, or newspapers in the relevant areas. However, for suggestions that are about individual departments but can be applied to other departments, such as the suggestion of female textile worker Chutkikh on improving quality, Kovalev's work method, etc., support and promotion are given.

　　Second, publicizing and promoting socialist competition. "Pravda's" guiding ideology for publicizing socialist competition is this: In publicizing socialist competition, the purpose of socialism and communism should be combined with people's daily labor. Socialism is built on the basis of labor. The newspaper should mobilize the enthusiasm of workers and technical experts, encourage the masses to work selflessly, and strive to create a better material foundation for socialism, and publicize this idea to the most backward people. At the same time, socialist competition is also a means of conducting communist education for the masses. The newspaper should use vivid and clear examples of the masses creatively participating in socialist construction, that is, use the masses' own experience to educate the masses, and strive to support the growth of new ideas and new attitudes of the masses towards labor and public wealth. During the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, workers and farmers thought this way: Socialism is great, but only geniuses can build socialism, not the workers and farmers themselves. When the workers and farmers personally participate in socialist competition, they can experience in their daily work that they are building socialism with their own strength. The newspaper's propaganda of socialist competition is to make workers and farmers realize that socialist construction is their own business and to turn socialist construction into concrete daily actions of the masses. The newspaper also mobilizes the masses to carry out socialist competition to help the Soviet Party and government overcome difficulties in construction.

　　But how does "Pravda" carry out this propaganda?

　　What is "Pravda's" role in this?

　　On January 20, 1929, "Pravda" published Lenin's article "How to Organize Competition" for the first time; on March 25, it published a letter from the Red Viborg Factory in Leningrad initiating a competition. The former was the ideological foundation and banner for the development of socialist competition that year, and the latter became the de facto starting point for socialist competition. Subsequently, "Pravda" opened columns to publish various suggestions, guarantees, and letters of criticism, such as "Workers' Mutual Response," "Under Mass Supervision," and "General Inspection of Production Meetings," etc.

　　The role of this kind of propaganda is very large, and it has been valued and supported by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out in its decision on socialist competition on May 9, 1929: The socialist competition initiated and developed by "Pravda," the mutual response of workers at the Red Viborg Factory and the Kamenetsk Paper Factory, and the general inspection movement of production meetings, as well as the socialist competition launched by trade union newspapers and other newspapers, must be carried out as mass competition in factories, mines, and transportation enterprises, attracting a wider range of workers to the competition.

　　During the first and second five-year plans, "Pravda" publicized the mass movement of extensive socialist competition, such as the Stakhanov movement, the activities of shock brigades and shock workers, etc. "Pravda" also used the form of red lists or honor rolls to commend the collectives of advanced people in socialist competition; in light of the characteristics of construction projects and construction workers, it paid attention to carrying out socialist competition among construction workers; it criticized engineering leaders and trade union organizations who did not care about the competition or took a wait-and-see attitude towards the competition; and it paid attention to supporting various initiatives of the masses. These have powerfully promoted the development of socialist competition in the Soviet Union at that time.

　　According to "Pravda's" experience, in publicizing labor competition, the newspaper should pay attention not to replace the Party and the trade union in guiding the competition. The newspaper can only be a forum for guiding the competition. At the same time, all initiatives are mostly proposed by the masses themselves. The newspaper can awaken them and prompt them to put forward their own initiatives, but the newspaper can in no way subjectively organize the competition. In addition, the newspaper should report as much as possible on the vivid experience of the masses in the competition and report on things related to human activities; and it should report less on the meetings, plans, etc. of the economic leadership organs.

　　Third, criticize various shortcomings and errors in economic work. The criticism in "Pravda's" industrial propaganda is roughly divided into the following three categories: (1) Criticism of leaders suppressing or delaying rationalization proposals and other bureaucratic styles; (2) Criticism of the phenomenon of a few workers violating discipline; (3) Criticism of shortcomings in production. Since the first five-year plan, "Pravda" has launched criticism of various shortcomings and errors in industrial construction. Not long ago, "Pravda" criticized the leaders of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Building Materials Industry for suppressing workers' suggestions, criticized the minister of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Coal Industry for not paying attention to workers' suggestions, and criticized the Soviet Union's Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Petroleum Trade Union for not promoting advanced experiences well. After being criticized, the leaders of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry held a meeting of the Ministry Affairs Committee to discuss the matter, and invited advanced workers to participate in the meeting. The meeting decided to dismiss the deputy director of the technical management office who had neglected his duties, and to give warnings to other relevant personnel. The various departments of the Ministry held Party meetings and carried out strict criticism. This critical article also caused a reaction in other industrial departments. From here, it can be seen that "Pravda" does not ask about the target or care about face when conducting criticism, and it is constantly engaged in an increasingly sharp struggle against all conservative, decadent, and stagnant phenomena. This should be a prominent feature of "Pravda" and all Soviet newspapers.

　　Policy Ideology and Technicality in Industrial Propaganda

　　"Pravda" constantly pays attention to publicizing specific methods, experiences, and technical issues in practical work, but "Pravda" has never published manuscripts on very specialized technical issues. Because "Pravda" is a political newspaper that combines with the broad masses, not a newspaper that specializes in reporting on production technology, reporting on specialized technical issues is inconsistent with "Pravda's" tasks and roles. "Pravda's" principle for handling this type of report is: any propaganda of advanced experience should start from political tasks and introduce the newly emerging advanced experience in plain language so that it can be accepted by the majority of readers. Technology must be publicized deeply and in many ways to avoid overly narrow technical issues, but it does not mean throwing manuscripts on technical issues into the wastebasket. Manuscripts on the most important technical issues should be revised until everyone can understand them before they are published; manuscripts on secondary technical issues should be forwarded to the relevant departments for reference.

　　In the newspaper, how should technology, business, methods, experience, and policy ideology, and political mobilization be combined for propaganda?

　　"Pravda's" propaganda on basic construction in the first five-year plan is the best illustration. At that time, the political task and purpose of "Pravda's" basic construction propaganda was to convey the grand ideas of the first five-year plan to every Soviet, arouse the masses' new labor enthusiasm, and strive to achieve the five-year plan. "Pravda" published the resolutions of the previous Party congresses and the resolutions of the government, as well as many editorials, such as "Take the Five-Year Plan to the Masses," etc. These documents and editorials explained the significance and tasks of industrialization to the readers. "Pravda" strived to make the published manuscripts have a high level of political and ideological level and to be as easy to understand as possible; when publicizing new construction projects, it not only simply introduced the project itself, but also explained the tasks and situation of the project. For example, on October 1, 1929, a special page was published with Lenin's words in the headline: "Only when the country is electrified, when the industry, agriculture, and transportation have the technical foundation of modern large-scale industry, can we finally triumph!" The special page was composed of manuscripts reflecting the faces, situations, and achievements of the construction of five key projects. In December 1930, on the tenth anniversary of Lenin's All-Russian Electrification Plan, "Pravda" organized two special pages, stating that the hydroelectric power stations built in 1931 would be equivalent to the power generation of twenty-five Volkhov hydroelectric power stations (the earliest hydroelectric power station built on Lenin's suggestion). The special page also published a chart comparing the power generation of seven countries, introducing the rapid growth of the production and power generation of Soviet power generation equipment, and also showing the degree of progress of Soviet electrification. The special page of "Pravda" on December 19, 1932 was even more significant and mobilizing. The headline of the special page was: "The Soviet Union farms with its own tractors and travels with its own cars!"

　　We can also use more recent examples to illustrate this problem. The article "Continuously Reduce Product Costs" written by an engineer from the Urals published in "Pravda" on August 13 last year only talks about how to use mass methods to mobilize the masses to actively put forward initiatives, and how the masses participate in the work of reducing product costs, but does not talk about the various technical methods of reducing costs. This article also talks about the issue of high-speed cutting, but it only focuses on how the masses use this advanced method, and does not talk about specialized technology. The articles introducing advanced experience written by advanced producers themselves published by "Pravda," such as the article "Reducing the Cost of the Construction Industry" written by the captain of a power excavator driver, only talks about what methods are used to reduce costs, how to rationally organize labor, and protect machinery, and does not even have a technical term. "Pravda" believes that if anyone wants to understand the details of specialized technical issues, he can write a letter to ask the advanced producer himself.

　　So, does "Pravda's" industrial propaganda not touch on issues in practical work? No! "Pravda" publicized many issues in practical work, but it did not have narrow technicality and business nature, but raised specific economic issues to the political and ideological level for explanation. For example, "Pravda" has proposed the issues of rationalization of construction work, standardization of materials, and lightweight structure in order to eliminate waste and save construction funds; at the same time, it also proposed to oppose conservatism and the pursuit of luxury in construction. "Pravda" called for cherishing materials and reducing construction costs. In November 1928, Kuibyshev wrote in "Pravda" that if we cannot reduce construction costs by 15%, we cannot complete the construction program. On October 18, 1930, "Pravda" published an article reporting on the results of a meeting of the leaders of 30 large projects in the country, introducing their experience in preparing for construction. At that time, some people engaged in construction work did not pay attention to the preparation of construction work, and started to build the main parts of the project without considering the roads, housing, canteens, auxiliary buildings, etc. necessary for construction, resulting in chaos in construction and delaying the speed of the project, making it impossible for the national construction plan to be completed at the planned speed. "Pravda" criticized the construction of a mine in the Urals, which was scheduled to be completed in 16 months, but it took 32 months to complete because the above-mentioned preparatory work was not done well. On April 3, 1930, "Pravda" criticized in an editorial: "The project started without a design!" The newspaper reported that a chemical factory and a factory in the Urals had started construction, but had not yet received the design drawings. Then, on April 6 of the same year, it published an editorial: "The most important thing is the design issue." In addition, "Pravda" also used special pages, columns, editorials, and special articles to publicize various issues in industrial construction such as distribution principles, centralized use of funds, supply of materials and equipment, saving metal, mechanized construction, and ordering of new construction equipment, and criticized the shortcomings in the work.

　　From this, it can be seen that while "Pravda" pays attention to publicizing the scale and scene of construction to inspire people, it also pays attention to putting forward many practical issues in industrial construction to guide the work; and in this propaganda, it strives to avoid introducing specialized technical and working method details so that the majority of readers can understand.

　　On the Issue of Publicizing the Improvement of Life and Overcoming Difficulties

　　In the early days of industrialization, the lives of the Soviet people were not very affluent, and some welfare issues were temporarily difficult for the state to solve. "Pravda's" experience in publicizing this issue is: every improvement in the lives of the people should be greatly publicized; instead of talking emptily about how to work hard, it should use concrete examples to educate the masses to overcome difficulties.

　　When the Soviet Union began large-scale industrial construction, the masses believed that since the state spent so much money to build large-scale industries, it would not spend much money to build houses to improve people's lives. But facts proved that large-scale industrial construction itself can improve people's lives. For example, after the start of large-scale construction, many people had jobs to do, and in 1930, the serious social problem of unemployment was solved throughout the Soviet Union. The poor peasants and hired farm laborers whose living conditions were very bad originally participated in factories and collective farms as soon as the large-scale construction started, and their living conditions began to change. When building large factories, it is inevitable to build some houses, schools, hospitals, and bathhouses, which are welfare facilities that were never seen before. In this process, "Pravda" constantly reported the news of the opening of new enterprises and workers going to work, such as the news of "Another 500 people went to work in Moscow today!" Using the facts to tell people that with the development of industrial construction, the phenomenon of unemployment will inevitably be eliminated. "Pravda" also introduced the construction of the area of ​​Zimenovka in the southeast corner of Moscow in a special page. In the past, the workers here slept in wooden sheds, and slept very crowded; and in just four years, many new houses, asphalt roads, and gardens were built here, renamed Lenin District. "Pravda" vigorously publicized these practical examples of improving life, educating the workers to understand that they were engaged in construction for themselves, which could improve the socialist consciousness of the workers and promote the workers to actively work and overcome difficulties.

　　"Pravda" attaches great importance to the propaganda of food issues. The food problem was very serious around the time of the first five-year plan. "Pravda" carried out propaganda based on the principles formulated by Lenin of "supervising food, eliminating speculation, saving food, and collecting food," reported on the positive grain delivery of middle peasants, poor peasants, and collective farms, and the collection of grain from rich peasants, and also exposed the facts of resisting grain collection, and commended and criticized the advanced and backward phenomena respectively. "Pravda" also reported on the food supply situation, and carried out a serious struggle with food speculators; it extensively reported on the issue of implementing rationing of food and daily necessities in order to ensure the most rational use of the then not abundant food and daily necessities, which played a very important role in implementing the rationing system. "Pravda" also frequently reported on the work of the worker life supply department set up in the factory at that time, and reported on the movement to develop worker vegetable gardens in worker residential areas. In this propaganda, "Pravda" reflected the various struggles of people to overcome life difficulties from many aspects and implemented the idea that economic construction is for improving people's material and cultural life. Therefore, these propaganda greatly encouraged the masses and mobilized people to participate in the Soviet Union's great socialist construction regardless of their own safety.

    学习“真理报”工业宣传的经验
    张沛
    工业宣传的任务
    从第一个五年计划开始，在全苏联展开了规模巨大的社会主义建设，特别是重工业建设。在这个期间，“真理报”的工业宣传的主要着眼点是：动员千百万群众的积极性和创造性，超额完成国家的计划。这也就是报纸工业宣传的政治目的和政治任务。
    我们这次访问“真理报”时，对“真理报”的经济宣传特别是工业宣传有如下几点体会。首先，在经济宣传中要特别强调通过人的活动来进行宣传，尤其要重视宣传先进生产者。这是因为，人是社会的主要生产力量，是人在运用着生产工具，实现着物质生产；而技术水平的提高，生产组织的改进，以及科学的应用，也都要依靠人的生产经验和劳动能力。但是，“真理报”在重视宣传先进革新者的思想、创造精神以及其他种种人的活动时，又特别注意宣传党的作用和群众的决定作用，并避免在宣传中长期纠缠在少数先进生产者身上，而且防止夸大个人作用的偏向。第二，在宣传中要阐明经济建设的根本目的是改善劳动者的物质与文化生活，不是为经济宣传而经济宣传。第三，经济宣传一定要接触到经济工作中的许多实际问题，如新技术、新方法的发明创造、设计、材料问题，等等。报纸不能回避这些问题，因为这是生活中所提出的。但是报纸又不应讲专门技术和业务方法的细节，而是要结合工业化的政治任务，把最重要的生产技术、经济业务等实际问题，尽量宣传得通俗易懂。“真理报”所要求的标准是，不仅要使普通工人，而且要使集体农民都能读得懂。第四，经济宣传必须要有重点。在苏联第一和第二个五年计划时期，“真理报”的经济宣传占全部版面的百分之五十到六十，并且运用专页、专栏的形式，作到集中、突出和连续，使“当前最主要的问题，经常不能离开报面”。同时在地区上也有重点。在第一个五年计划中，“真理报”在第聂伯水电站、斯大林格勒与哈尔科夫的拖拉机工厂、乌拉尔的重型机器厂、库兹涅斯克的钢铁厂、土西大铁路、罗斯多夫的农业机器厂等基本建设重点工程中，都派有驻外编辑部。
    从以上这些情况可以看出，“真理报”的工业宣传是和工业问题紧密结合的，但又不是仅就工业问题来进行工业宣传，而是有明确的政治目的和政治任务的。
      工业宣传的主要内容
      “真理报”工业宣传的主要内容，可分为三个方面：
    第一，动员企业内部的潜在力，这是报纸工业宣传中一项很重要的内容。
      “真理报”在工业宣传中一直很强调这种指导思想：认为只有大量增加工人才能提高产量是错误的，同时，认为增强体力劳动的强度就能提高生产也是错误的。一个工厂应当有必要数量的工人和技术人员，但这并不是说工人的数量可以比实际需要多，可以让工人耗尽体力。俄国伟大的军事学家苏沃洛夫说过：不是以数量，而是以本领去战胜敌人。劳动也不能靠数量而要靠本领。因此就应当这样来组织生产：以比较少的人，消耗比较少的体力和材料，而能生产更多更好的产品。这就是有高度效率和高度智慧的社会主义的劳动。“真理报”号召人们去进行这种智慧的劳动，号召人们很好地利用企业的潜在力量。
      “真理报”如何为利用企业内部的潜在力而斗争呢？主要的就是研究、总结和推广先进生产者的经验。这当中首先是注意让生产革新者自己在报纸上发言。一九五三年一年中“真理报”发表了六十八篇先进生产者自己写的文章，大多配合有本人的照片，登在第一版上。另外，“真理报”也请一些作家写特写来介绍先进生产者。还约请一些专家、学者、厂长、党委书记根据不同部门的特点，写出有分析有批判的专文，以便把这许多先进经验条理化、系统化。其次，是运用专页的形式，集中突出地宣传先进生产者的经验。专页宣传是推广先进经验的一个重要方法，它可以有各种不同的内容。以
  “真理报”一九五三年所发表的专页为例，其中有宣传和推广提高劳动生产率的专页。如在“在高度技术的基础上提高劳动生产力是我们成绩的主要保证”的总题下，发表了炼钢工人、爱沙尼亚的纺织女工、乌拉尔运河工地的掘土机的机长、莫斯科的一个工厂的厂长、顿巴斯的一个采煤司机、一个集体农庄的耕种组组长等十几个人的文章，和全苏工会书记戈罗希金写的“论社会主义竞赛”的论文，另外还在一版发表了全面地分析概括专页中各种先进经验的社论“坚决地提高劳动生产率”。有关于降低生产成本的专页，如在“降低成本是大力提高与改进劳动者生活的道路”的总题下，介绍了高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车厂降低生产成本的经验。专页中发表了党委书记、总工程师、总会计师、工长的文章，刊出了说明成本降低情况的图表，另外也发表了社论。有专门谈机械化、自动化的以技术性问题为主题的专页，不过这种技术性的专页不谈多数人看不懂的技术细节。有关于“更好地利用生产场地”的竞赛的专页。这是去年冬季在苏联出现的一个新的竞赛运动，运用这种办法发掘潜在力，可以不建筑新厂房而提高生产，以免在莫斯科、列宁格勒等大城市建设的工厂过多，影响居民的健康；又可以节省许多建筑材料、人力和资金，拿去建筑住宅。“真理报”在专页“在每一平方公尺的场地上生产更多的产品！”的总题下，介绍了莫斯科灯泡工厂的先进经验，也发了社论。
    这里需要注意两个问题，一个是在测定一项先进经验的有效性和它的实际价值时，应该具体考虑经济上的效果。假如是炼钢工人的建议，就应该看他究竟炼出了多少钢，比别的工人在同一时间炼出的要多多少；假如是一个建筑工人的先进经验，就应该看他建筑的速度有多大等等。而在作这种估价时，应依靠有关的党的组织、工业主管机关和工会，听取他们的意见。另一个是报纸决不可能全部登出所有的先进经验。“真理报”所采取的办法，是不登具体的、个别的或只与少数地方的某种生产部门有关的建议，这些由工厂墙报、地方报纸或有关地区的报纸刊载即可。而对于虽是关于个别部门的建议，但可以运用到其他部门去的，如女纺织工邱特基赫提出的关于提高质量的运动的建议、郭瓦廖夫工作法等等，则加以支持和推广。
    第二，宣传和推动社会主义竞赛。“真理报”宣传社会主义竞赛的指导思想是这样的：在进行社会主义竞赛的宣传中，要把社会主义、共产主义的目的和人们的日常劳动结合起来。社会主义是在劳动的基础上建设起来的，报纸要动员工人和技术专家们的积极性，要鼓舞群众忘我地劳动，为更好地创造社会主义的物质基础而斗争，并把这种思想宣传到最落后的人身上去。同时，社会主义竞赛又是对群众进行共产主义教育的手段，报纸要用群众创造性地参加社会主义建设的生动而鲜明的实例，也即用群众自己的经验来教育群众，并努力支持群众对于劳动和公共财富的新思想新态度的生长。在苏联第一个五年计划时，曾有工人和农民这样想：社会主义是伟大的，但是只有天才才能建设社会主义，而不是工人、农民自己。当工农群众亲自参加社会主义竞赛时，他们就可能在每天的劳动中，体会到正在用自己的力量亲手建设社会主义。报纸宣传社会主义竞赛，就是要使工人、农民劳动者认识到社会主义建设是他们自己的事情，把社会主义建设变为群众具体的日常行动。报纸并且要动员群众开展社会主义竞赛，帮助苏联的党和政府克服建设中的困难。
    但是，“真理报”是怎样进行这一宣传的呢？
  “真理报”在这方面的作用又是怎样呢？
    一九二九年一月二十日，“真理报”第一次发表了列宁的“怎样组织比赛”一文；三月二十五日，又发表了列宁格勒红色威博尔士工厂发起竞赛的一封信。前者是那一年社会主义竞赛开展起来的思想基础和旗帜，后者则成了社会主义竞赛事实上的起点。接着，“真理报”辟了刊载各种建议、保证、批评来信的专栏，如“工人们的相互响应”、
  “在群众的监督下”、“生产会议大检查”，等等。
    这类宣传的作用是很大的，并且得到了联共
  （布）中央的重视和支持。“真理报”所发起的生产会议大检查，在一个月中就收到从六个城市寄来的二十万件改进生产的建议。联共（布）中央在一九二九年五月九日关于社会主义竞赛的决定中就这样指出：由“真理报”所发起和开展起来的社会主义竞赛，由红色威博尔士工厂和卡门茨克造纸工厂的工人们的相互响应及生产会议大检查运动，以及由工会报纸和其他报纸所开展的社会主义竞赛，必须作为工厂、矿山和交通企业的群众竞赛而加以开展，把更广泛的工人群众吸引到竞赛中来。
    在第一、第二个五年计划当中，“真理报”宣传了广泛的社会主义竞赛的群众运动，如斯达哈诺夫运动，突击队和突击队员的活动，等等。“真理报”还用红榜或光荣榜的形式，表扬社会主义竞赛中的先进者的集体；针对建筑工程和建筑工人的特点，注意在建筑工人中开展社会主义竞赛；对不关心竞赛或对竞赛抱袖手旁观态度的工程领导人和工会组织，进行了批评；以及注意支持群众的各种创议。这些，都有力地推动了当时苏联的社会主义竞赛的开展。
    根据“真理报”的经验，在宣传劳动竞赛中，报纸应注意不要代替党和工会去指导竞赛，报纸只能是指导竞赛进行的讲坛。同时，一切创议在大多数情况下都是群众自己提出的，报纸可以唤醒他们，提示他们提出自己的创议，但是报纸无论如何不能主观地去组织竞赛。另外，报纸应尽量多报道群众在竞赛中的生动经验，报道和人的活动有关的东西；而对于经济领导机关的会议、计划等等，则应该少报道些。
    第三，对经济工作中各种缺点和错误要展开批评。“真理报”在工业宣传中的批评，大致有以下三类：（一）对领导人压制或拖延合理化建议及其他官僚主义作风的批评；（二）对少数工人破坏纪律的现象的批评；（三）对生产中的缺点的批评。从第一个五年计划开始，“真理报”就向工业建设中的各种缺点和错误展开了批评。在不久以前，“真理报”批评了压制工人建议的苏联建筑材料工业部的领导人，批评了不重视工人建议的苏联煤矿工业部的部长，批评了先进经验推广得不好的苏联石油工业部和石油工会。建筑材料工业部的领导人受到批评后，由部务委员会开会进行了讨论，并请先进工作者参加了这个会。会议决定将失职的技术管理处副处长撤职，给其他有关人员以警告。部的各主管部门都召开了党的会议，进行了严格的批评。这篇批评文章在其他各个工业部门也都引起了反应。从这里可以看出，“真理报”在进行批评时，是不问对象不顾情面的，而且是经常与一切保守的、腐朽的、停滞不前的现象，作越来越尖锐的斗争。这应该是“真理报”和所有苏联报纸的一个突出的特点。
      工业宣传中的政策思想性和技术性
    “真理报”不断地注意宣传实际工作中的具体方法、经验和技术问题，但是“真理报”从来没有刊载过关于非常专门性的技术问题的稿件。因为“真理报”是与广大群众相结合的政治报纸，不是专门报道生产技术的报纸，报道专门性的技术问题是与“真理报”的任务与作用不相符的。“真理报”处理这一类报道的原则是：对任何先进经验的宣传，都要从政治任务出发，要用通俗的语言介绍新出现的先进经验，使它能够为广大读者所接受。必须深刻地多方面地宣传技术，避免过分狭窄的技术问题，但是又并不是将技术问题的稿件扔到字纸篓里。关于最重要的技术问题的稿件，应将它修改到大家都能看懂时才予以发表；关于次要的技术问题的稿件，则转到有关部门作参考。
    在报纸上究竟如何将技术、业务、方法、经验与政策思想、政治鼓动相结合来进行宣传呢？
  “真理报”在第一个五年计划中关于基本建设的宣传是一个最好的说明。当时“真理报”基本建设宣传的政治任务和目的，是使第一个五年计划的雄伟思想，传达给每一个苏联人，唤起群众新的劳动热情，为实现五年计划而奋斗。“真理报”发表了历次党代表会的决议和政府的决议，又发表了许多社论，如“把五年计划拿到群众中去”等，这些文献和社论向读者说明了工业化的意义和任务。“真理报”努力做到使发表的稿件有高度的政治思想水平，并要尽量作到通俗易懂；宣传新建工程时不只是简单介绍一下工程本身，而且要阐明工程的任务和情况。例如，一九二九年十月一日发表了一个专页，刊头是用列宁的话：“只有当国家已电气化的时候，当工农业运输业已有了现代大工业的技术基础的时候，我们才能最后胜利！”专页用反映五个重点工程建设的面貌、情况和成就的稿件组成。一九三○年十二月纪念列宁全苏俄电气化计划十周年时，“真理报”组织了两个专页，表明在一九三一年建设的水电站将等于二十五个伏尔霍夫斯克水电站的发电量（根据列宁建议最早建设起来的水电站）。专页上还登着一个图表，以七个国家的发电量作比较，介绍苏联发电设备的生产和发电量生长的迅速，也表示了苏联电气化进展的程度。一九三二年十二月十九日“真理报”的专页更是具有重大意义和鼓动性的，专页的刊头是：“苏联用自己的拖拉机种地，用自己的汽车走路！”
    我们也可以用比较近的例子来说明这个问题。去年八月十三日“真理报”发表的乌拉尔的一个工程师写的“不断减低产品成本”一文，只讲如何采用群众性的办法发动群众积极地提出创议，群众如何参加减低产品成本的工作，而不是讲减低成本的技术上的各种作法。这篇文章也谈到高速切削的问题，但也只着重讲群众如何运用这种先进方法，而不讲专门技术。“真理报”登载的先进生产者自己写的介绍先进经验的文章，如一个电力掘土机司机队长写的“降低建筑工业的成本”一文，就只讲用什么办法降低成本，如何合理地组织劳动、保护机器，连一个技术性的术语也没有。“真理报”认为：谁如果要了解专门技术问题的细节，他可以写信问先进生产者本人。
    那么，“真理报”的工业宣传是否不接触实际工作中的问题呢？不是的！“真理报”宣传了许多实际工作中的问题，但没有狭隘的技术性和业务性，而是把具体的经济问题提高到政治、思想上加以阐明。例如，“真理报”提出过建筑工作的合理化、材料的标准化、结构的轻便化的问题，以消除浪费现象，节约建设资金；同时还提出要反对建筑上的保守主义和追求豪华的现象。“真理报”号召要爱护材料和降低建筑成本。一九二八年十一月古比雪夫在“真理报”上撰文说：假如我们不能把建筑成本降低百分之十五的话，我们就不能完成建筑的纲领。一九三○年十月十八日“真理报”发表了一篇文章，报道国内三十个大工程领导人开会的结果，介绍他们关于建设中准备工作的经验。当时有一些从事建设工作的人，不重视施工准备工作，一开始就去建设工程的主要部分，不考虑建设施工所必需的道路、住宅、食堂、辅助建筑等，结果造成施工中的混乱现象，使工程速度反而推迟下来，使国家建设计划不能按照预定的速度完成。“真理报”批评了乌拉尔一个矿山的建设，这个矿预定十六个月完成，就因为没有做好上述的准备工作，结果三十二个月才完工。一九三○年四月三日“真理报”曾在社论中批评：“工程没有设计就开工了！”报纸反映了一个化学工厂和乌拉尔的一个工厂，工程开工的时候到了，但还没有拿到设计图纸。接着在同年四月六日又发表了社论：“最主要的是设计问题”。此外，“真理报”还对分布原则、集中使用资金、材料设备供应、节约金属、机械化施工、新建工程设备的订货等工业建设中的各种问题，分别运用专页、辟栏和社论、专文等形式作了宣传，并对工作中的缺点进行了批评。
    由此可以看出，“真理报”在注意宣传建设的规模和景象以鼓舞人心的同时，也很注意提出工业建设中的许多实际问题以指导工作；而在这项宣传中，又力求避免介绍专门技术和工作方法的细节，使广大读者都能看懂。
    关于宣传生活改善和克服困难的问题
    在实行工业化的初期，苏联人民的生活还不很富裕，而有些生活福利问题，国家又暂时难以解决。“真理报”宣传这个问题的经验是：对人民生活的每一点改善都要大加宣传；不空洞地讲如何艰苦奋斗，而要用具体事例，教育群众克服困难。
    苏联开始大工业建设时，群众认为：既然国家花了这样多的钱去建设大工业，就不会再用很多钱去建筑住宅改善人民的生活。但是事实证明，大工业建设本身就可以改善人民的生活。例如，大建设开始后，许多人就有了工作做，一九三○年又在全苏联解决了失业这个严重的社会问题。原来生活状况很坏的贫农雇农，大建设一开始就参加了工厂和集体农庄，生活状况开始有了变化。在建设大工厂时，又必然要建筑一些住宅、学校、医院、洗澡堂，这些都是从前所没有过的生活福利上的设施。在这当中，“真理报”就不断地报道新企业开工、工人上工的消息，如“莫斯科今天又有五百人上工了！”的消息，用事实告诉人们：随着工业建设的开展，失业现象将必然地被消灭。“真理报”又用专页介绍了莫斯科的东南角齐美诺夫卡这个地区的建设。从前这里的工人睡在木板棚里，睡得很挤；而在短短的四年中间，这里建设了许多新的住宅、柏油马路、花园，改名为列宁区。“真理报”大力宣传这些生活改善的实际事例，教育工人懂得他们是为了自己在从事建设，这样就能提高工人群众的社会主义意识，推动工人积极劳动克服困难。
      “真理报”是很重视粮食问题的宣传的。粮食问题在第一个五年计划前后很严重，“真理报”根据列宁制订的“监督粮食、消灭投机、节约粮食、征集粮食”的原则进行了宣传，报道了中农、贫农、集体农场积极交粮的事例，和向富农征集粮食的情况，也揭露了反抗征集粮食的事实，对先进和落后的现象分别进行了表扬和批评。“真理报”又报道了粮食供应情况，与粮食投机者进行了严重的斗争；大量报道了对粮食和日用品实行配给制的问题，以保证最合理地使用当时并不充裕的粮食和日用品物资，这在贯彻配给制方面，起了很重要的作用。“真理报”还经常报道那时工厂中所设的工人生活供应部的工作，报道了在工人住宅区开展工人菜园的运动。“真理报”在这一宣传中，从多方面反映人们克服生活困难的各种斗争，并贯彻着经济建设是为了提高人民物质与文化生活的思想，因此这些宣传就大大地鼓舞了群众，动员人们奋不顾身地参加苏联的伟大的社会主义建设。
