Tractor Driver Pan Deshan
By Our Correspondent Fang Qing

	In late September 1949, in the northwestern corner of the motherland, a People's Liberation Army force was fiercely suppressing the remnants of the Ma Hongkui bandit gang.

	The mobilization meeting for the advance on Yumen was held in Lanzhou.

	"Our mission—to swiftly liberate Yumen!" The resolute and definite call, when it reached the ears of armored vehicle driver Pan Deshan, he immediately began all preparations for the advance. After carefully checking and adjusting all the components, he sat in the driver's seat, ready to depart at any time.

	On the road, Pan Deshan often thought of his difficult childhood—a hired farmhand's child who started herding pigs for the landlord at twelve and became an apprentice heating worker at fourteen... Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, all of China was liberated, and the people's own country was established, only then did he truly become a master of the country. Thinking of this, it seemed that the circulation of blood throughout his body became faster, and his energy became more abundant.

	Two days later, the troops arrived in Zhangye. Before he had time to rest, Pan Deshan received a new order: "Must reach Yumen within twenty-four hours!" Because the enemy was plotting to blow up all the equipment of this industrial city.

	Although it was only six hundred li from Zhangye to Yumen, at that time it wasn't just one vehicle rushing ahead, but forty-five armored vehicles full of combat troops, arranged in a combat formation, and they had to maintain close contact with each other, so the speed of travel was naturally restricted. Pan Deshan fully estimated the arduousness of the task, unable to think of anything else, only to fight for time! Time is everything!

	In the past, drivers and assistants took turns driving, but now, Pan Deshan did not leave the steering wheel for even a moment.

	As a result, they ran ahead of schedule, arriving in Yumen three hours early. Three days later, in the square of the Yumen Oil Mine, Pan Deshan stood next to the armored vehicle, shoulder to shoulder with the oil mine workers, and held a meeting to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, and at the same time to celebrate the liberation of Yumen.

	For the victory of this march, his comrades awarded Pan Deshan a first-class merit, and from then on, he wore the "People's Hero" medal on his chest.

	While Pan Deshan was thinking about how to contribute more to the country, the doctor proved that his stomach illness was very serious and not suitable for work in the army, and the superiors also mobilized him to go home. He returned to his hometown—Hailong County, Liaodong Province, and worked in the local state-owned farm, and the following year he was transferred to the Hailong Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station, where he has been driving large tractors—"Stalin Eighty."

	When he first arrived at the farm, Pan Deshan felt very unaccustomed. For example, in the army, whether it was the driver, the assistant, the superior, or the subordinate, they were all comrades, but as soon as he got home, many people called him "Master Pan," which he found very unpleasant. In the army, he only took care of the armored vehicle; now, he also had to take care of the plowshares behind the tractor. From these concrete problems, he increasingly missed the army, missed his comrades…

	But this emotion quickly cleared up in his mind. He thought: one cannot do two things at the same time. If he wanted to, he would simply return to the army, which was not possible at the time. If he wanted to, he would work steadfastly and do a good job. Not only should he arrange himself this way, but more importantly, the work needed him to do so. After thinking about it repeatedly, he finally settled down.

	In the autumn of 1953, when Pan Deshan accepted the task of autumn plowing, he clearly estimated the difficulties at the time: after autumn, it was rainy, the ground was wet, and it was easy to get stuck when plowing; and the temperature dropped sharply, and the land would soon freeze. However, Pan Deshan did not mention anything at the time, just like receiving a combat order in the army. Because he firmly believed that strong perseverance would overcome all objective difficulties.

	After accepting the task, the first thing he considered was how to maximize mechanical efficiency. According to the maximum traction of the Stalin Eighty tractor, it could pull ten large plows; however, this was not something that a worn-out old machine could handle. Therefore, it was necessary to do a thorough and serious job of maintenance, so that an old tractor could function like a brand-new machine. When repairing the locomotive, he inspected every part meticulously, just like inspecting a tank before going into battle. As a result, the tractor did not have a single malfunction during plowing. He spared no effort, like eliminating the enemy on the battlefield, and under adverse conditions, he increased the amount of plowing to an average of nine hectares and one mu per day, exceeding the prescribed task by one hectare and six mu; while the consumption of fuel was saved by an average of 1.1 kilograms per hectare. Therefore, he was selected as the labor model of the entire station.

	In winter, after studying the general task of the country during the transition period, Pan Deshan further realized ideologically how important and glorious his job was, and strengthened his sense of enterprise a hundredfold.

	Before the spring plowing this year, Pan Deshan was sent to a branch station to cultivate more than thirty hectares of land for an agricultural production cooperative with a small tractor. He treated it as if he were planting land for his own family, not only undertaking the machine cultivation part, but also being responsible for guiding the entire year's production process, and even personally helping the masses with weeding and thinning seedlings. When signing the cultivation contract, he learned about local farming habits through seminars and social gatherings, and asked the farmers for advice; at the same time, he also taught the farmers new agricultural techniques. The farmers suggested that the tractor left a ditch behind when plowing, which was inconvenient for planting, so Pan Deshan installed two wooden boards behind the plowshare to scrape the soil flat. The farmers suggested that the "Hot Te" tractor was not suitable for harrowing because the ditches pressed by its two large rubber wheels were uneven, so Pan Deshan installed a duck-foot-shaped small plow behind each of the wheels, so that the front wheels would press over, and the small plow behind would loosen the soil. In short, whenever possible, he would try his best to meet the farmers' requirements, help the farmers well, and increase grain production. (Attached picture)

    拖拉机手潘德山
    本报记者　方青
    一九四九年九月下旬，祖国的西北角，正有一支人民解放军痛剿马匪鸿逵残部。
    向玉门进军的动员大会，是在兰州开的。
    “我们的任务——迅速解放玉门。”坚决、肯定的号召，传到装甲车驾驶员潘德山耳朵里的时候，他立刻着手进军的一切准备工作。把各部机件仔细检查、调整之后，便坐在司机室里，随时准备出发。
    在路上，潘德山常常想起自己苦难的童年——一个雇农的孩子，十二岁就给地主放猪，十四岁当了暖汽工学徒……多亏共产党的领导，解放了全中国，成立了人民自己的国家，这才真正成为国家的主人。想到这里，好像周身的血液循环的更快，精力越发充沛。
    两天以后，部队到了张掖。还没有来得及休息，潘德山就接到一个新的命令：“必须在二十四小时内进至玉门！”因为敌人正阴谋炸毁这个工业城市的一切设备。
    从张掖到玉门，虽然只有六百里路；但，那时不是一部车子横冲直撞，而是四十五辆满载作战部队的装甲车，排成战斗队形，彼此必须保持密切联系，当然行进速度会受到一定限制的。潘德山充分估计到任务的繁重，旁的什么也顾不得想，只有争取时间！时间就是一切！
    以往，驾驶员和助手轮流开车，现在，潘德山一会儿也没有离开方向盘。
    结果，他们跑到了时间的前面，提前三小时进到玉门。三天以后，在玉门油矿的广场上，潘德山站在装甲车的旁边，和油矿工人并着肩膀，举行了庆祝中华人民共和国成立的大会，同时庆祝玉门的解放。
    为了这次进军的胜利，战友们评了潘德山一大功，从此，他胸前佩上了“人民功臣”的奖章。
    潘德山正在想怎样对国家贡献更多些的时候，医生证明他的胃病已十分严重，不适合部队工作，上级也动员他回家。他回到家乡——辽东省海龙县，在地方国营农场工作，第二年又调到海龙农业机器拖拉机站，一直就开大型拖拉机——“斯大林八十号”。
    乍一到农场，潘德山感到很不习惯，比方，在部队里不论是驾驶员、助手，上级、下级，都是同志，但是一到家，好多人都叫他“潘师傅”，他觉得很不顺耳。在部队里，只管装甲车；现在，还要照顾拖拉机后面的犁铧。从这些具体问题，引起他越发怀念部队，怀念他的战友们……
    但是，这种情绪很快在他思想上澄清了。他这样想：一心不能二用。要?，就干脆回到部队去，这在当时是没有可能的。要?，就踏踏实实地工作，把工作做好。不仅应当这样安排自己，而且，更重要的是工作需要自己这样做。经过这样反复思考之后，他才算是安下心来。
      一九五三年秋，潘德山接受秋翻地的任务时，他分明估计到当时的困难：入秋以后，阴雨连绵，地湿，翻地时容易陷车；而且气温急剧下降，土地将很快结冻。但是，潘德山当时什么也没有提，像在部队上接受作战命令一样。因为他坚信，坚强的毅力，会战胜一切客观困难的。
    接受任务以后，他首先是考虑如何发挥机械效能。按斯大林八十号拖拉机最大牵引力，可以拉十个大铧子；但是，这不是一台磨损相当严重的旧机器所能胜任的。因此就要靠检修工作做得确实、认真，让一台旧的拖拉机和全新的机器那样起作用。在检修机车时，他就像投入战斗之前检修坦克那样，每一个零件都经过了缜密的检查。结果拖拉机在翻地时没有发生过一点故障。他像在战场上消灭敌人那样不遗余力，在恶劣条件下，把翻地数量平均每天提高到九垧一亩，超过规定任务一垧六亩；而油料的消耗，却每垧地平均节省一点一公斤。因此，他被选为全站的劳动模范。
    冬季，潘德山学习了国家过渡时期的总任务以后，进一步从思想上认识到自己的工作岗位是何等重要，何等光荣，百倍地坚定了自己的事业心。
    今年春耕以前，潘德山被派到一个分站，用一台小型拖拉机，代耕农业生产合作社的三十多垧地。他就像给自己家里种地一样，不光是担任机器耕作部分，全年的生产过程他都要负责指导，甚至亲自动手，帮助群众锄草、间苗。在订立代耕合同的时候，他通过座谈会、联欢会，了解当地耕作习惯，向农民请教；同时，也把新的农业技术教给农民。农民提出拖拉机翻地，后面留一道沟，不便播种，潘德山就在铧子后面安上两块木板，把土刮平。农民提出“热特”拖拉机不适合于耙地，因为它的两个大胶皮轮子轧的沟耙不平，潘德山又在轮子的后面各安一个鸭掌形的小铧，前边轮子轧过去，后面小铧就把土松开。总之，只要有可能，他就尽量满足农民要求，好好帮助农民，提高粮食产量。（附图片）
