Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 4th. The Geneva Conference continued its discussion of the Korean question on the afternoon of the 4th, with Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon serving as chairman.

Canadian representative Pearson spoke first. He began by saying that he was only speaking because he feared his silence would be misunderstood as a lack of firm support from Canada for the American policy of aggression in Korea, and indifference to the criticism of the United States at the conference. From this starting point, his entire speech was nothing more than defending and applauding the American policy of aggression. He vainly attempted to obliterate the accusations of American aggression made by Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. He said that because Canada participated in the war of intervention in Korea conducted by the United States under the guise of the United Nations, Canada could not support any proposal that differed from the United Nations' position on the Korean issue. He stated that he fully accepted the significance of events occurring in Asia and acknowledged that this development could not and should not be reversed. He hypocritically sympathized with the Asian people's movement for national liberation, yet he slanderously attacked the Chinese people for shaking off the shackles of imperialism. To prove that the United States was not an aggressor, he greatly exaggerated the "friendship" between the United States and Canada, urging people not to fear the United States. But everyone knows that American power has deeply penetrated Canada. Canada's position as a neighbor of the United States is not enviable. Pearson also absurdly compared the joint use by China and the Soviet Union of the Lüshun military base to prevent the resurgence of a re-armed Japanese militarism, with the military bases established by the United States in Asia for the purpose of aggression. Pearson opposed discussing the issue of prisoners of war at the Geneva Conference. He said that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had "given all prisoners of war the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to return to communism," although everyone knew that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in its "interim report" and "final report," pointed out that captured personnel from the DPRK and China did not have the freedom to request repatriation due to the threat of force and intimidation from American special agents. Pearson opposed the proposals put forward by DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il. His arguments showed that he feared that organizing an all-Korean commission and holding nationwide elections in Korea would prevent the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee clique from continuing. He avoided mentioning the proposals in Nam Il's suggestion regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the joint guarantee by relevant countries for the peaceful development of Korea. Although Pearson said that the success of the Geneva Conference would greatly benefit peaceful development, his entire speech did not include any suggestions that would help peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

Dutch representative Luns spoke next. Luns believed that the unification of Korea should be based on the will of the Korean people expressed through secret ballot, but he repeated Dulles's so-called "proportional representation" argument, opposing Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal to hold nationwide elections in Korea without any foreign interference. Luns vainly attempted to use resolutions passed by the United Nations under American manipulation to prove that the Syngman Rhee government, created single-handedly by the United States under the name of the "United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea," was the so-called "sole legitimate government" of Korea, although he had to admit that at the time there was "much debate over the method of conducting elections in Korea." Luns one-sidedly distorted the history of the outbreak of the Korean War, citing a large number of illegal resolutions passed by the United Nations under American manipulation, but he completely omitted the criminal acts of the United States occupying China's Taiwan and bombing and strafing Chinese territory with large numbers of aircraft, nor did he mention that China and the Soviet Union had repeatedly advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue since the beginning of the Korean War. Everyone knows that the Chinese people only volunteered to resist American aggression and aid Korea after the UN forces, disregarding repeated warnings from the Chinese side, crossed the 38th parallel and approached the Chinese border, but Luns ignored the facts. He not only defended the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on October 7, 1950, but also slandered China for "invading" Korea, although he had to admit the importance of Korea to China's security. He deliberately distorted the efforts made by the Korean and Chinese sides to resolve the Korean issue, openly defended the so-called "no forced repatriation" principle used by the United States to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and shirking the US responsibility for delaying the truce negotiations. Luns finally requested that all factors related to the Korean dispute be discussed and resolved one by one in order to minimize differences of opinion.

The next speaker was Abyssinian representative Zawde Gabre-Heywot. Heywot expressed the hope that this conference could bring "lasting peace" to Korea, but he described the American war of aggression against Korea under the name of the United Nations as being for "collective security." Heywot said that he advocated the peaceful unification of Korea and hoped for the early withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, however, he avoided mentioning that Korea could only achieve true peaceful unification after the withdrawal of foreign troops. Heywot finally called for a spirit of compromise at the conference in order to reach a solution.

The chairman then announced that no one else had registered to speak at today's meeting, and no one had registered to speak at the meetings on the 5th and 6th. Therefore, he suggested that informal discussions be held on the 5th and 6th so that different views could be clarified and brought closer together. No one objected to the chairman's proposal, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The next meeting will be held on the 7th.

    日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
    定五月五日和六日两天举行非正式讨论
   【新华社日内瓦四日电】日内瓦会议于四日下午继续讨论朝鲜问题，由泰国代表旺亲王担任主席。
    加拿大代表皮尔逊首先发言。他一开始就说，他之所以发言只是因为害怕他的缄默被人误解为加拿大对美国在朝鲜的侵略政策缺乏坚决的支持，和对于会议上对美国的谴责漠不关心。从这一点出发，他的整个发言就不过是为美国的侵略政策辩护和捧场。他徒然地企图抹煞莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长对美国侵略政策的指责。他说，由于加拿大参加了美国假联合国之名进行的干涉朝鲜的战争，因此加拿大不能支持任何与联合国在朝鲜问题上的地位不同的建议。他说他完全接受在亚洲发生的事件的意义，并且承认这种发展是不能并且不应加以逆转的。他伪善地同情亚洲人民争取民族自由的运动，可是他却对中国人民摆脱帝国主义的羁绊肆行诬蔑。他为了证明美国不是侵略者，大事吹嘘美国和加拿大的“友谊”，叫人不要害怕美国。可是谁都知道，美国势力已经深深渗入了加拿大。加拿大作为美国邻国的地位并不是令人羡慕的。皮尔逊还荒谬地把中、苏两个为防止被美国重新武装的日本军国主义的再起而共同使用的旅顺军事基地，与美国为进行侵略而在亚洲建立的军事基地相提并论。皮尔逊反对在日内瓦会议上讨论战俘问题。他说，中立国遣返委员会已经“给予一切战俘以自行决定是否回到共产主义去的机会”，虽然大家知道，中立国遣返委员会在其“临时报告”和“最后报告”中都指出朝中被俘人员由于受到美方特务的武力威胁和恐吓，并没有自由要求遣返的机会。皮尔逊反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日提出的建议。他所提出的论点表明他害怕组织全朝鲜委员会、在朝鲜进行全国普选会使李承晚集团的反动统治不能继续下去。他对于南日建议中关于撤退在朝鲜的外国军队和有关各国共同保证朝鲜和平发展的主张避而不谈。皮尔逊虽然说日内瓦会议的成功对和平发展会有很大的裨益，可是他的整个发言没有包括任何有助于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    荷兰代表伦斯接着发言。伦斯认为，朝鲜的统
  一应该根据朝鲜人民以秘密投票方式表示的意志，可是他却重复杜勒斯的所谓“比例代表”的论调，反对南日外务相提出的在朝鲜举行没有任何外国干涉的全国选举的建议。伦斯徒然地企图以联合国在美国操纵下通过的决议，来证明美国假“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”之名一手制造的李承晚政府是朝鲜的所谓“唯一合法的政府”，虽然他又不得不承认当时“对在朝鲜进行选举的方法曾啧有烦言”。伦斯片面地歪曲朝鲜战争爆发以来的历史，引述了一大堆联合国在美国操纵之下通过的非法决议，可是他却完全不提美国侵占中国的台湾、以大批飞机轰炸扫射中国领土的罪恶行为，也不提中国和苏联在朝鲜战争开始后即一再倡议和平解决朝鲜问题。大家知道，中国人民只是在联合国军不顾中国方面的多次警告越过三八线迫近中国边境之后才志愿抗美援朝，但伦斯不顾事实，他不但为一九五零年十月七日联合国大会通过的决议辩护，而且诬蔑中国
  “侵入”朝鲜，虽然他不得不承认朝鲜对中国安全的重要性。他故意歪曲朝中方面为解决朝鲜问题而作的努力，为美国借以强迫扣留战俘的所谓“不强迫遣返”的原则公开辩护，并且为美国推卸拖延停战谈判的责任。伦斯最后要求一一讨论与解决朝鲜争论有关的因素，以便尽量缩小相互之间的意见分歧。
    下一个发言的是阿比西尼亚代表藻德·加布莱·赫沃特。赫沃特表示希望这个会议能使朝鲜获得“永久的和平”，但是，他却把美国在联合国名义下侵略朝鲜的战争说成是为了“集体安全”。赫沃特说，他主张和平统一朝鲜，希望早日从朝鲜撤退外国军队，然而，他又避免提到：只有在外国军队撤退之后，朝鲜才能达到真正的和平统一。赫沃特最后呼吁在会议上采取妥协精神，以便得出解决办法。
    主席接着宣布，没有其他的人报名在今天会议上发言，同时也没有人报名在五日和六日会议上发言，因此建议在五日和六日举行非正式讨论，使不同的观点得以澄清和接近。没有人对主席的建议表示反对，会议即于下午五时休会。下次会议将于七日举行。
