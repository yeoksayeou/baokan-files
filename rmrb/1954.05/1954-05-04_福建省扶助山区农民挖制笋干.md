Fujian Province Supports Mountain Farmers in Digging and Producing Dried Bamboo Shoots
    Spring bamboo shoots in the mountainous areas of Fujian Province have already emerged from the ground, and farmers are flocking to the mountains to dig and produce dried bamboo shoots.

    This year, Fujian Province's dried bamboo shoot production will reach approximately 130,000 dan, more than double last year's total output of 60,000 dan.

    In order to support farmers' production and expand market supply, the Yong'an and Jian'ou central branches of the People's Bank of China have issued loans totaling 1.7 billion yuan in the dried bamboo shoot producing areas. The state-owned China Food Company Fujian Provincial Company has also allocated 1.5 billion yuan to pre-purchase dried bamboo shoots from mountain farmers. This year, the state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives will significantly increase their purchases of dried bamboo shoots compared to last year, and the purchasing work is expected to begin around late May.

    Dried bamboo shoots are one of Fujian Province's main special products, with the main producing areas being Jianyang, Nanping, and Yong'an. In recent years, with the gradual improvement of the people's living standards domestically, the sales of dried bamboo shoots have been very brisk. Last year alone, the income of farmers in the northern Fujian mountainous area from producing dried bamboo shoots reached 18 billion yuan. With the increase in production this year, the people in the mountainous areas will obtain more income to expand production investment and improve their own lives. Bamboo shoot farmers are excitedly welcoming the bamboo shoot harvest.

    福建省扶助山区农民挖制笋干
    福建省山区春笋早已出土，农民已纷纷上山挖笋制笋干。
    今年福建省笋干产量将达十三万担左右，比去年总产量六万担增加一倍以上。
    为了扶助农民生产，扩大市场供应，省人民银行永安、建瓯中心支行，已在笋干产区发放贷款十七亿元；国营中国食品公司福建省公司也同时拨款十五亿元，向山区农民预购笋干。今年国营商业部门和合作社对笋干的收购量将比去年大大增加，收购工作约在五月下旬即可开始。
    笋干是福建省主要特产之一，主要产地为建阳、南平、永安三专区。几年来随着国内人民生活水平逐步提高，笋干销路十分畅旺，去年一年闽北山区农民产制笋干的收入便达一百八十亿元。今年随着产量增加，山区人民将获得更多的收入，来扩大生产投资和改善自己生活。笋农们正兴奋地迎接竹笋丰收。
