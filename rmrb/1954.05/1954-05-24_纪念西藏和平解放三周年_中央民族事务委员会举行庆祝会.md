Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The State Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government held a celebration in Beijing on the 23rd to commemorate the third anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Li Weihan, Chairman of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, Vice Chairmen Liu Geping, Wang Feng, Zhang Zhiyi, and all members in Beijing attended the celebration. All representatives from various regions who came to Beijing to attend the Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission also attended the celebration.

Also participating in the celebration were Rampa Nangji Wangdui, Director of the Dalai Lama's Office in Beijing, Lian Huizhu, Deputy Director of the Panchen's Office in Beijing, Ngawang Jimpa, Deputy Head of the Tibetan National Day Observation Group, and members of the delegation staying in Beijing.

Responsible persons from relevant departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Commerce, and Tibetan students from the Central Institute for Nationalities also attended the celebration.

Vice Chairman Liu Geping delivered a speech at the meeting. He expressed warm congratulations for the third anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the bright future of the Tibetan people. He said that since liberation, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and with the help of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Tibet has made some progress in politics, economy, and culture. The unity between the Han and Tibetan peoples has been strengthened day by day, and the unity between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni within Tibet has also been further consolidated. Recently, China and India signed the "Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India," and Tibetan monks, officials, and people, like the people of the whole country, expressed their heartfelt satisfaction and support. He went on to point out that the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, in accordance with the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, have been helping the Tibetan people to develop agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce, build roads, establish banks and trading companies, issue interest-free agricultural and animal husbandry loans and low-interest handicraft and commercial loans, purchase wool and other local products and specialties, supply daily necessities, and establish schools and hospitals. This has brought the relationship between the Tibetan people and the interior unprecedentedly close, and has powerfully guaranteed the progress and development of Tibet. He said that the Kangzang Highway is now being built simultaneously from the east and west, and the distance between them is not far. He believes that after the highway is open to traffic, the central government's assistance to Tibet will gradually increase, and the connection between the interior and Tibet will become closer.

Xiraojiacuo, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Northwest Administrative Committee and Acting President of the Buddhist Association of China, and Sangye Yeshe, Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government of Xikang Province and Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government of Sichuan Province, spoke at the meeting successively. They unanimously congratulated the third anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, believing that today three years ago was a great day of joy for the Tibetan people. Xiraojiacuo said that the People's Government cherishes the people of minority nationalities, and the Communist Party respects the freedom of religious belief of all nationalities. Based on my profound personal experience, this is beyond doubt. We must unite better, be vigilant against the destructive conspiracies of imperialism, and build a great motherland. Sangye Yeshe introduced the situation in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province after the implementation of regional autonomy. These two autonomous regions have realized the right of the Tibetan people to manage their own affairs, and both autonomous regions have achieved remarkable achievements in politics, economy, and culture, and the people's lives have also been initially improved. Rampa Nangji Wangdui, Director of the Dalai Lama's Office in Beijing, and Ngawang Jimpa, Deputy Head of the Tibetan National Day Observation Group, also spoke at the meeting. Rampa Nangji Wangdui talked about the achievements made in all aspects of Tibet in the three years since the peaceful liberation. He said that today the people of all towns and cities in Tibet will celebrate this glorious day with joy and excitement. He expressed his gratitude and respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. Ngawang Jimpa said that we were entertained by the Central People's Government and participated in the National Day celebrations in the capital last year, and visited various parts of the motherland. We saw various great construction projects, which made us deeply feel the prosperity and strength of the great motherland. In the future, our Tibetan people must thoroughly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet under the leadership of the Central People's Government, work hard to produce, and build a new Tibet. The celebration ended in a warm and joyful atmosphere. A dinner was held after the meeting. A joint celebration party was held in the evening.
