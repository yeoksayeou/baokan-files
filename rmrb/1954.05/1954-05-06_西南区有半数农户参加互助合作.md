Chongqing Dispatch: Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Southwest China have been further consolidated and developed during the spring plowing season. The number of farming households organized throughout the region has increased from 39 percent last winter to over 50 percent. In Guizhou Province, it has reached 66 percent of the total number of households. In Rongchang, Jiangbei, and Qijiang counties of Sichuan Province, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid groups has more than doubled compared to last year. In the Yuxi area of Yunnan Province, the number of organized farmers has reached more than 167,000 households, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of farming households.

The quality of mutual aid groups in various regions has generally improved during the spring plowing production. In Shehong County, Sichuan Province, the proportion of year-round mutual aid groups has also increased from 28 percent of the total number of groups to 36 percent. Many mutual aid groups have automatically accumulated public property. In Guanxian County, Sichuan Province, 309 mutual aid groups have public-owned cattle, farm tools, mills, and public accumulation funds. Fengdu, Jiangjin, and other counties have generally implemented a work evaluation and point recording system in mutual aid groups. Some have adopted a piece-rate system in addition to adopting joint group mutual assistance, which has improved management and production.

In order to strengthen leadership over mutual aid groups, many places have established mutual aid and cooperation networks and regularly hold joint group meetings to exchange experiences. At the same time, mutual aid and cooperation backbones are being widely trained. In Suining and Yibin areas of Sichuan Province alone, the number of people trained has reached 140,000.

The development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations has powerfully promoted the patriotic production increase movement. In Qujing County, Yunnan Province, driven by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, new ponds and dikes were built to conserve water, saving more than 27,000 mu of spring crops. In Luxian, Fushun, and Longchang counties of Sichuan Province, farmers are organized to observe and learn from each other, promoting advanced techniques. This year, more than 80 percent have adopted mud and water seed selection and new-style seedling fields. In Qijiang County, 9,000 mutual aid groups have accumulated 280 million catties of fertilizer, generally increasing the amount of fertilizer applied, and the seedlings are growing very vigorously.

    西南区有半数农户参加互助合作
    【本报重庆四日电】西南区互助合作组织，在春耕中进一步得到巩固和发展。全区组织起来的农户已由去冬的百分之三十九增至百分之五十以上。贵州省达总户数的百分之六十六。四川省荣昌、江北、綦江三县参加互助组的农户都较去年增加一倍多。云南省玉溪专区组织起来的农户已达十六万七千多户，达总农户数的百分之七十三。
    在春耕生产中，各地互助组的质量普遍有了提高。四川省射洪县常年互助组的比重也有提高，由占总组数的百分之二十八增至百分之三十六。不少互助组都自动积累了公共财产。四川省灌县三百零九个互助组都有了公有的耕牛、农具、碾磨和公积金。酆都、江津等县互助组普遍实行评工记分制度，有的除采用按件记工办法以外，还实行联组互助，改进了管理和生产。
    为了加强对互助组的领导，许多地方建立了互助合作网，定期举行联组会议，交流经验。同时并普遍训练互助合作骨干，仅四川省遂宁、宜宾两专区受训人数即达十四万人。
    互助合作组织的发展，有力地推动了爱国增产运动。云南省曲靖县在农业生产合作社和互助组带动下，新修塘堰积水，抢救小春作物两万七千多亩。四川省泸县、富顺、隆昌三县组织农民相互观摩，推广先进技术，今年采用泥水选种和新式秧田的达百分之八十以上。綦江县九千个互助组积肥二亿八千万斤，普遍增加了施肥量，秧子长得很旺。
