    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 9th: TASS reported from Paris on May 8th: "L'Humanité" published a statement from the Politburo of the French Communist Party regarding the necessity of ensuring a peaceful resolution of the issues discussed at the Geneva Conference.

    The statement mentioned some easing of the conspicuous international tension at the Geneva Conference, and the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement pointed out that these facts were of positive significance.

    The statement continued: "The efforts of the United States to prolong and expand the war, and the French government's requests for direct American intervention in Indochina, have now failed. But the danger has not been eliminated, because the enemies of peace have not abandoned their plans of aggression, and Bidault has not abandoned his attempts to obstruct the Geneva Conference. However, the hope of millions of people in France and Vietnam who demand an end to the war, especially after the bloody battle of Dien Bien Phu, can become an immediate reality."

    The Politburo called on all Communist Party members to actively participate in the struggle of the broad masses to demand an immediate end to the Vietnam War.

    号召党员参加要求停止越南战争的斗争
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社巴黎八日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党政治局的一篇声明，谈到保证日内瓦会议所讨论的问题获得和平解决的必要性。
    声明谈到日内瓦会议上引人注目的国际紧张局势的某些缓和及中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国的代表参加会议，声明指出这些事实都是有积极意义的。
    声明接着说：“美国方面竭力延续并扩大战争和法国政府要求美国直接干涉印度支那的行动，目前已告失败。但是危险还没有消除，因为和平的敌人还没有放弃他们的侵略计划，皮杜尔还没有放弃阻挠日内瓦会议的企图。但是，法国和越南的千千万万人民要求停止战争的希望，特别是在奠边府血战之后，是可以成为眼前的事实的。”
    政治局号召全体共产党员积极参加广大群众要求立刻停止越南战争的斗争。
