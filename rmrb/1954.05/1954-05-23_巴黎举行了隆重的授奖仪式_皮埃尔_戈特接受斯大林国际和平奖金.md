Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 19th: According to TASS, a grand award ceremony was held in Paris on the 18th for Pierre Cot, the outstanding peace fighter and famous French public and political leader, to receive the Stalin International Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples. Those attending the ceremony included: V.I. Yerofeyev, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in France; heads of diplomatic missions in France from People's Democratic countries; leaders of the French Communist Party headed by Jacques Duclos; members of the National Assembly and the Senate of the Republic; representatives of the French General Confederation of Labor, the French National Peace Council, the France-USSR Association, and the French Women's Union; and renowned French scientists, writers, artists, and journalists.

The famous French writer and Vice-Chairman of the Stalin International Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples Committee, Louis Aragon, delivered the opening speech. He spoke of Pierre Cot's outstanding contributions to the international peace movement. He emphasized that it was no accident that the Stalin International Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples was awarded to the fourth representative of the French people, as France occupies an important position on the world map.

Next, Pierre Meunier read a congratulatory telegram from Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the National Assembly, who was unable to attend the ceremony from Lyon. Former French Prime Minister Paul Boncour spoke, stating that Pierre Cot had received the world's most prestigious award—the Stalin International Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples. He said, "I have not forgotten, and will never forget, that great nation whose soldiers' fierce battles on the Eastern Front made the Normandy landings and the liberation of France possible."

The renowned British public figure, Pritt, delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of British peace advocates. The renowned French scientist Joliot-Curie and National Assembly member Delavigerie also spoke, congratulating Pierre Cot.

The Soviet writer Ehrenburg then spoke, saying: "Pierre Cot has always defended the cause of peace, the true meaning of France and humanity, and international friendship." He congratulated Pierre Cot on behalf of the Soviet Peace Committee and paid tribute to the French people.

Ehrenburg said: "We live in different parts of our common home—Europe—and we are equally concerned with protecting this home from fire. I understand and love your country. I know that people like you, like President Herriot, who has made great efforts to strengthen relations between our two peoples and spread the idea of European collective security, and like the great scientists Joliot-Curie and Aragon, maintain France's prestige and honor in the world. You can believe me, when we see the actions and hear the words of those who try to undermine the friendship between our two peoples, we will never believe that these actions and words represent the will of the French people, because they are not in line with your country's traditions of loving freedom and hospitality."

In his reply, Pierre Cot said: "When I learned that I had been awarded the Stalin International Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples, I felt very proud. Because the honor brought by this prize is the highest honor that a person with my views and beliefs could hope for. I have the right to believe that awarding me the Stalin International Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples is first and foremost a reward for our magazine 'Defend Peace', secondly a reward for the work of the entire French peace movement, and finally a reward for all the honest people in our country who firmly believe in the harmonious coexistence of all nations and the future of mankind, and who regard this belief as the banner of our stormy era."

Pierre Cot continued: "The first thought that we should never forget is that the most important issue of our time is the peaceful coexistence of different social and political systems. Under conditions of peaceful coexistence, a certain degree of international trust will at least give rise to the seeds of international cooperation. The second thought that should serve as our guide is that the balance of international forces is constantly changing. From now on, when measuring all international issues, it is absolutely necessary to properly consider the national consciousness and the movement for national survival of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas."

Pierre Cot pointed out that adapting to changes in the international situation requires constant consultation and the continuous reaching of new agreements. He concluded by saying that all the clever maneuvers of diplomats and all the experience of politicians are not enough to consolidate peace. Both should be based on the will of the people. It is this will of the people that our World Peace Council is trying to express and emphasize, and ultimately ensure its victory.

    巴黎举行了隆重的授奖仪式
    皮埃尔·戈特接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十九日讯：杰出的和平战士、法国著名的公众和政治领袖皮埃尔·戈特十八日在巴黎接受“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金。参加授奖仪式的有：苏联驻法国大使馆临时代办维·伊·叶罗菲耶夫，人民民主国家驻法国外交使团首长，以雅克·杜克洛为首的法国共产党的领袖们，国民议会议员和共和国参议院议员，法国总工会、法国全国和平理事会、法苏协会和法兰西妇女联盟的代表，法国著名的科学家、作家和艺术家以及记者。
    法国著名作家、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会副主席路易·阿拉贡致开会词。他谈到了皮埃尔·戈特对国际和平运动所作的杰出贡献。他着重指出，把“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予法国人民的第四个代表不是偶然的，因为法国在世界地图上占有一个重要的地位。
    接着，皮埃尔·麦尼埃宣读了没有能从里昂来参加授奖仪式的国民议会荣誉议长爱德华·赫里欧的贺电。法国前总理保罗·邦古讲话。他说皮埃尔·戈特得到了世界上最崇高的奖励——“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金。他说，我没有忘记，将来也永远不会忘记这个伟大的国家，它的战士们在东线上的激烈战斗，使得诺曼底的登陆以及法国的解放成为可能。
    著名的英国公众领袖普里特代表英国和平拥护者致贺辞，著名的法国科学家约里奥—居里和国民议会议员德拉维热里也致词向皮埃尔·戈特祝贺。
    苏联作家爱伦堡接着发言。他说：皮埃尔·戈特一向保卫着和平事业、法国与人类的真义，保卫着国际的友谊。他代表苏联拥护和平委员会向皮埃尔·戈特祝贺，并向法国人民致敬。
    爱伦堡说：我们生活在我们的共同家庭——欧洲——的不同的地方，我们都同样地关心着保护这个家庭，使它不遭到火灾。我了解并且爱你的国家。我知道像你这样的人，像为争取加强我们两国人民之间的关系和传播欧洲集体安全主张而作了很大努力的赫里欧议长这样的人，像伟大的科学家约里奥—居里和阿拉贡这样的人，都保持了法国在世界上的威望与荣誉。你可以相信我，当我们看到那些企图破坏我们两国人民的友谊的人们的行为，听到他们的言论的时候，我们决不会认为这种行为与言论是代表法国人民的意志，因为它们是与你的国家热爱自由与好客的传统不相符合的。
    皮埃尔·戈特致答辞说：当我知道我被授予“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的时候，我感到非常骄傲。因为这一奖金带来的光荣，是具有我这样的观点和信仰的人所能希望的最高的光荣。我有权利认为，把“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授给我，首先是对于我们的“保卫和平”杂志的奖励，其次是对于法国整个和平运动的工作的奖励，最后是对于我国所有正直的人民的奖励，他们坚决相信各国人民的和睦相处与人类的未来，他们把这种信念当作是我们这个暴风雨时代的旗帜。
    皮埃尔·戈特接着说：我们应当一刻不忘地记在心中的第一个思想就是：我们这个时代最重大的问题就是各种不同的社会和政治制度和平共处的问题。在和平共处的情况下，某种程度上的国际信任至少会产生国际合作的萌芽。应当作为我们的指针的第二个思想是：国际力量的对比随时在发生变化。从现在起，衡量一切国际问题时，无论如何必须适当地考虑到非洲、亚洲和美洲各国人民的民族觉悟和求民族生存的运动。
    皮埃尔·戈特指出，通过不断的协商和不断地达成新的协议，才能适应国际形势的变化。他最后说，外交家的一切巧妙手腕和政治家的一切经验都不足以巩固和平。这两者都应该以人民的意志为基础。我们世界和平理事会正在想表达并着重指出的就是这种人民的意志，最后要保证它取得胜利。
