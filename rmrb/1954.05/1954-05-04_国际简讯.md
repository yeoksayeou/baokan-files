    French Workers Hold 24-Hour General Strike
    French workers began a 24-hour general strike on April 28, demanding a guaranteed minimum monthly wage of 25,166 francs, as well as general increases in wages, allowances, and pensions.
    The strike was called by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), and the Catholic Confederation of Labour also participated. Other trade union federations, including the "Workers' Force" controlled by the right-wing Socialist Party, refused to call on their members to take joint action with the CGT to fight for the satisfaction of the workers' main demands.
    According to "L'Humanité," the strike began at midnight at train stations in Paris, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Poitiers, Marseille, and other cities, as well as at post offices and Air France and many other enterprises.
      Syngman Rhee Plans to Massively Expand Army
    Syngman Rhee's generals are hurrying to draw up plans to expand the South Korean army. Their haste is due to the imminent visit of U.S. General Van Fleet to South Korea, where he will inspect the effectiveness of the U.S. government's military aid to the Syngman Rhee clique. The plan to be submitted for Van Fleet's approval is scheduled to expand the South Korean army to three field armies, each composed of nine to twelve divisions (the Syngman Rhee army currently has twenty divisions). At the same time, plans are being made to establish a trained reserve force of one million men within the next two to three years.
      Yoshida Government Forcibly Approves U.S.-Japan Military Agreement in Diet
    After manipulating the House of Representatives to pass the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" and three other related agreements on March 31, the Yoshida government forcibly approved them in the Senate on April 28. Thus, these new agreements by which the United States intensifies its rearmament of Japan and enslavement of Japan have completed legislative procedures and are ready to take effect from May 1.
    In coordination with the U.S. conspiracy to intensify the arming of Japan, the Yoshida government is openly clamoring for expanded armaments and war preparations. Kimura Tokutaro, Director-General of the camouflaged military department "National Safety Agency," said on the 28th: "The Japanese Constitution, which prohibits engaging in war, may have to be revised in the near future so that full-scale rearmament can be carried out." He also admitted that the so-called "Self-Defense Forces" expanded in accordance with the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" are regular troops that the Constitution stipulates shall not be maintained.
      United States Establishes Military Base in Gilgit
    According to a recent report in the Indian Urdu newspaper "Naya Jug," citing the American-published "Middle East Journal," U.S. military experts have completed the construction of air force bases and other military bases in Gilgit and Chitral, which border Kashmir and the Soviet Union. It is said that a vast network of U.S. military bases is being built from Gilgit to Rawalpindi.
      Indian Newspaper Condemns U.S. Espionage Activities in India
    Indian public opinion demands that resolute measures be taken against U.S. espionage activities in India, which threaten India's independence and security.
    The "People's Daily," an influential bourgeois newspaper published in Lucknow, called for "a thorough investigation into the activities of foreign missionaries in India." The newspaper called on the Indian people to be vigilant, pointing out that the activities of American "missionaries" are not only "an internal problem of India but also an international problem."
