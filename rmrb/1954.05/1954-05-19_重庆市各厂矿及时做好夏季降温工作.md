Chongqing is the hottest city in Southwest China during the summer. Every summer, steel rolling and steel pouring workers operating in front of temperatures of one thousand degrees are drenched in sweat, and textile factory workshops usually have temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Last year, due to insufficient attention to reducing workshop temperatures, factories experienced shutdowns, reduced production, and even worker fainting. To protect worker health and complete state plans on schedule, this year, factories and mines have learned from last year's lessons and made cooling preparations early. Textile factories, in addition to repairing and adding ceiling fans, sprayers, and roof water spraying equipment last winter, the state-owned No. 610 Textile Factory installed a Soviet-style cold air room, and Shashi, Yuhua, and Yuxin factories also followed suit. The state-owned No. 611 Cotton Mill has added thirty-two sets of small air coolers, roof water sprays, and sprayers this year. Steel factories began cooling work this spring. The No. 102 Factory has more than fifty cooling projects this year, the largest of which number ten. The project to promptly transport slag and steel billets to dissipate heat sources in the steelmaking plant has been completed. Xu Baosheng, deputy director of the No. 104 Factory, designed an "air shower," with plans to make thirty-eight units, and more than twenty have already been completed. Factories and mines have paid attention to the design, construction, and material supply of cooling projects, preventing procrastination and shirking responsibilities, so the project is progressing faster and will be completed by the end of May. At the same time, based on last year's experience, factories and mines have also considered adjusting labor organization and working hours in the summer, such as construction workers starting work earlier and finishing later, and silk factories changing to early and late shifts, extending the noon break. Summer extracurricular activities such as studying and meetings should be reduced or stopped as much as possible; meals should be well prepared, a sufficient supply of cool drinks should be provided, and special attention should be paid to the nutrition of workers operating in high temperatures. It is a necessary measure to ensure that workers eat well, sleep well, and rest well. Workers with heart disease, high blood pressure, and malignant anemia who operate in high temperatures should find ways to change their jobs. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued cooling instructions to factories and mines, requiring early preparations. In February this year, the Southwest and Chongqing Municipal Labor Bureaus, Health Bureaus, the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized a cooling work group to inspect various factories and mines. Chongqing Transportation and Electrical Equipment Company has fully supplied cooling equipment, all of which are favorable conditions for this year's cooling work.

    重庆市各厂矿及时做好夏季降温工作
    重庆是西南区夏季最炎热的城市。每年夏季，在一千度高温前操作的轧钢和浇钢工人汗流浃背，纺织厂车间温度通常在华氏一百度以上。去年各厂因对降低车间温度工作重视不够，曾发生停车、减产甚至晕倒工人的现象。为保障工人健康和按期完成国家计划，今年各厂矿吸取去年教训，很早做了降温准备，纺织工厂去年冬天除动手修理和添置吊风扇、喷雾器以及屋顶喷水的设备外，国营六一零纺织厂装置了苏联式的冷风室，沙市、裕华、渝新各厂也仿照安置。国营六一一纱厂今年添置了三十二套小型冷风机，屋顶喷水和喷雾器。钢铁各厂降温工作是今春开始的，一零二厂今年降温工程有五十多项，最大的有十项，炼钢场修建的及时运走炉渣、钢胚以疏散热源的工程已经竣工。一零四厂副厂长徐宝升设计一种“空气淋浴”，计划作三十八部，已做好二十多部。各厂矿注意了降温工程的设计、施工和材料供应，防止了拖拉、推诿的毛病，工程进行较快，五月底将全部完工。同时，各厂矿根据去年经验，还考虑到在夏季调整劳动组织和工作时间的问题，如建筑工人早上班，晚下班，各丝厂改为早、晚两班，延长中午休息时间。夏季业余活动如学习、开会等应尽量减少和停止；办好伙食，充分供应清凉饮料，特别注意高温操作工人的营养，这都是使工人吃好、睡好、休息好的必要措施。有心脏病、高血压和恶性贫血的高温操作工人，应设法调换他们的工作。中共重庆市委向厂矿企业发出降温指示，要求及早做好准备。今年二月，西南和重庆市劳动局、卫生局、全国总工会西南办事处、市工会联合会共同组织降温工作小组到各厂矿作了检查。重庆市交通电工器材公司充分供应了降温器材，都是今年降温工作有利的条件。
