Northeast fruit-producing area farmers are making various efforts to strive for increased production. In the major producing areas, fruit trees are growing well; apple blossoms are in full bloom, and pear trees have finished flowering and are setting fruit.

This year's planned fruit output for the Northeast region is higher than last year, with planned apple production increasing by more than ten percent. Apples are mainly produced in southern Liaodong Province and Dalian; pears are mainly produced in western Liaoning and Rehe provinces. To complete this year's production increase plan, all fruit-producing areas have actively consolidated and developed mutual aid and cooperation organizations for fruit tree production. The number of fruit production cooperatives in the entire region has increased from twenty last year to one hundred and thirty this year. Fruit-producing areas have also held training classes on fruit tree planting and management techniques and pest and disease control. In Gaiping County, Liaodong Province alone, fifteen hundred peasant technicians were trained. To change the face of mountainous areas and improve the living standards of mountain farmers, most of the 1.56 million newly planted fruit trees in the region this year are on the mountains.

    东北水果产区努力争取增产
    东北区水果产区农民正作各种努力，争取增产。主要产区果树生长良好，苹果花正在盛开，梨树已落花著果。
    今年东北区水果计划产量比去年增加，其中苹果计划比去年增产一成多。苹果主要出产在辽东省南部和旅大市；梨主要出产在辽西、热河两省。为了完成今年的增产计划，各水果产区都积极整顿和发展了果树生产互助合作组织。全区果树生产合作社已由去年的二十个增加到今年的一百三十个。各水果产区还举办果树种植管理技术和防治病虫害的训练班，仅辽东省盖平县就训练了一千五百名农民技术员。为了改变山区的面貌和提高山区农民的生活水平，今年全区新栽的一百五六十万株果树，大部是在山上。　（据新华社讯）
