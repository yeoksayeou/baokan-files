On the occasion of "May Day" International Labor Day—a festival of solidarity for working people worldwide—I hereby extend, on behalf of the Chinese working class, fraternal congratulations to you, and through you to the heroic Korean working class and all working people.

The unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Korea, cemented with blood, defeated the armed aggression of American imperialism and defended the independence and freedom of Korea.

While striving to build our motherland, we, the Chinese working class, will do our best to support the peaceful reconstruction work of the Korean people. May the working classes of our two countries unite closely and strive together to strengthen the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union, to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, to further ease international tensions, and to defend peace in Asia and the world!
