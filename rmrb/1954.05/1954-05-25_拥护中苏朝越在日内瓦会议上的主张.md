Shanghai People of All Circles

The people of all circles in Shanghai warmly support the speeches made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, North Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il, and Vietnamese Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong at the Geneva Conference. Workers in many factories have held seminars and mass rallies in recent days. Labor models Wang Linfu, Liu Cuilian, Ren Ruihua, and others have pointed out that these speeches and suggestions are the fairest and most reasonable proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and also conform to the interests of peace-loving people all over the world. They also earnestly hope for the success of the Geneva Conference. National textile industry labor model Yi Shijuan and textile worker Yang Lanhua, who attended the World People's Peace Congress, said at a seminar at the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill: We understand that accelerating the socialist industrialization of the motherland is the most reliable force for defending peace. They pledged to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's just stance with practical actions to improve quality and reduce costs.

Teachers and students of primary, secondary, and higher education institutions in Shanghai have held various gatherings to express their full support for our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's position at the Geneva Conference. The graduating "Zoya Class" students of Shidong Middle School proposed to support Foreign Minister Zhou's just stance with concrete actions to ensure obedience to the country's assignments.

On the 18th, the China Peace Committee, East China Branch and Shanghai Branch, convened a seminar attended by more than 100 representatives from all walks of life. More than 20 people spoke at the meeting. Xia Yan, vice chairman of the China Peace Committee Shanghai Branch, pointed out at the meeting: The proposals of the Chinese, Soviet, North Korean, and Vietnamese delegations at the Geneva Conference expressed the desire of the Korean and Vietnamese people to strive for independence and peace. The US imperialist attempt to undermine the Geneva Conference will inevitably meet with a shameful defeat. The people of Shanghai fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's speech and will work with the people of the whole country and the people of the world to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference. Wu Yaozong, a member of the World Peace Council and a religious figure, said: The fair proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina powerfully expressed the wishes of our country and the people of Asia. Writer Xiong Foxi said: Writers and actors should use their artistic weapons to promote peace and oppose wars of aggression, which is the best practical action to support Foreign Minister Zhou's speech.

We fully support and fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's speech. Now US imperialism is still continuing to carry out sabotage activities against the Geneva Conference, and conspiring to expand the war of aggression. We must be a hundred times more vigilant and resolutely oppose all the conspiracies and sabotage activities of the warmongers.

In the statements, people from all walks of life proposed to support the just propositions of our Foreign Minister Zhou and the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam at the Geneva Conference with practical actions. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions stated in its statement: "The entire working class of Wuhan will strengthen planning management with the spirit of unity, bravery, diligence, and hard work, implement the three-level-one-chief responsibility system, and deeply carry out labor competitions with technological innovation as the main content, and strive to comprehensively and balancedly complete and over fulfill the national plan, accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, and strengthen the strength of the peace and democracy camp, in order to support the just propositions of Foreign Minister Zhou and the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam, strive for the success of the Geneva Conference, and defend peace in Asia and the world." The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Suburban Farmers Association also guaranteed in its statement to actively and steadily develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and continuously improve the production of vegetables and non-staple foods, and support the speeches of Foreign Minister Zhou and the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam with these practical actions.

Industrial labor model Quan Shude said: We are very concerned about the progress of the Geneva Conference and earnestly hope that the conference will be successful. Foreign Minister Zhou's speech at the conference is fair and reasonable. If US imperialism dares to undermine peace, it will only fail. The recent victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in liberating Dien Bien Phu is clear proof of the unparalleled power of peace.

At the Sixth Session of the Third People's Representatives Conference of Xi'an held from the 17th to the 19th, the representatives generally expressed concern about the Geneva Conference in their speeches.

Acting President of the Buddhist Association of China
Xirao Jiacuo

Xirao Jiacuo, acting president of the Buddhist Association of China, issued a written statement, supporting the solemn propositions put forward by the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam at the Geneva Conference.

Xirao Jiacuo said: The Geneva Conference, which was convened for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, is in session. The delegations of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam have all put forward fair and reasonable propositions for solving the above-mentioned issues based on the spirit of sincere consultation and the desire for peace. However, the US imperialists, who are unwilling to admit defeat, refuse to learn from their war of aggression against Korea, and are still doing everything possible to obstruct the Geneva Conference both inside and outside the conference, making it impossible for the conference to proceed smoothly. It is wholeheartedly attempting to expand the Indochina War, create international tensions, and disrupt the peaceful life of the Asian people. It also insidiously vainly attempts to defile Buddhism and organize some kind of "Buddhist National League." Chinese Buddhists of all ethnic groups, like the people of all China and the people of all Asia, love peace. We deeply know that peace is the foundation of all happiness; therefore, we will never allow the conspiracy of the US imperialists, who are enemies of peace, to succeed.

Xirao Jiacuo said: We—Chinese Buddhists of all ethnic groups—express our firm support for the sincere efforts made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and the delegations of the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam at the Geneva Conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina; and will resolutely and unremittingly fight together with the people of the whole country to promote our country's peaceful construction and defend peace in Asia and the world!

Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association
Da Pongsheng

Da Pongsheng, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, issued a statement supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference.

Da Pongsheng said: People all over the world attach great importance to the Geneva Conference, and the people of Asia are especially concerned about this conference, hoping that it can peacefully resolve the Korean issue, restore peace in Indochina, and ensure the complete independence of Indochina, thereby consolidating world peace and security. The people of China who believe in Islam, like the people of the whole country, are extremely concerned about the progress of this conference. We fully support and firmly support the righteous and forceful speeches made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and fully support the speeches of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il, and Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong; and are very indignant at the conspiratorial activities of the US imperialist warmongers to undermine the Geneva Conference. US imperialism's attempt to continue pursuing colonialism in Asia and expand the war in Asia will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the peace-loving and kind people of the world, especially the people of Asia, and will eventually meet with a shameful defeat. We Chinese Muslims will unite closely with the people of all ethnic groups in the country and the people of the world, and strive to promote the success of the Geneva Conference and defend peace in the world and Asia.
