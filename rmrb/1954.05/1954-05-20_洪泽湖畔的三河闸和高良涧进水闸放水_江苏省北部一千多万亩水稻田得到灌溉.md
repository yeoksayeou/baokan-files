Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th. On May 15th, the Sanhe Sluice and Gaoliangjian Intake Sluice on the shore of Hongze Lake were opened, and the water from Hongze Lake flowed into the Lixiahe area of ​​northern Jiangsu Province through a huge irrigation network. More than 10 million mu of rice fields in more than ten counties were irrigated. This is the first time in the history of the Lixiahe area that water has been released for irrigation according to the needs of farmland. This time, the Gaoliangjian Intake Sluice released 200 cubic meters per second of water into the main irrigation canal and the West Main Canal (Li Canal), and the Sanhe Sluice released 700 cubic meters per second of water into Baoying Lake, Gaoyou Lake, and Shaobo Lake, and then into the South Main Canal (Tongyang Canal) and the southern section of the West Main Canal. Dozens of large and small culvert gates along all the main canals were opened around the 15th. The torrents passing through the sluice holes stirred up a cloud of white spray, and then flowed along thousands of diversion rivers to the green fields. Now, the local farmers are busy preparing for rice transplanting. In Gaoyou County, the single-cropping paddy fields have been cultivated once, and 30% of the paddy fields have been cultivated twice. Farmers in Baoying, Yancheng, Xinghua and other counties have prepared 80% of the base fertilizer for paddy fields. In the past, local farmers planted short-growing and low-yielding rice varieties because they feared droughts and floods. This year, various places have widely promoted improved rice varieties such as "Nante No." and "Shengli Xian."

In the past, the Lixiahe area of ​​northern Jiangsu Province lacked water for irrigation during the rice transplanting season, and the canal was interrupted; during the autumn harvest season, the Huai River overflowed again, and the crops that were about to ripen were submerged by floods. After liberation, the people of northern Jiangsu Province enthusiastically participated in the great Huai River harnessing project and local water conservancy projects, successively renovated the Hongze Lake Dam and the Grand Canal Dam, and excavated the main irrigation canal running across northern Jiangsu Province, and connected the main irrigation canal with the West Main Canal and the South Main Canal end to end. At the same time, water level regulating structures such as the Sanhe Sluice, Gaoliangjian Intake Sluice, Yundong Diversion Sluice, and Huaian Control Sluice were built. This has initially formed a huge farmland irrigation network, making the Lixiahe area of ​​northern Jiangsu Province truly a rich granary.

Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 19th. The 15 irrigation diversion rivers newly opened along the south bank of the Subei Main Irrigation Canal in the lower reaches of the Huai River have been completed. These 15 diversion rivers connect the Subei Main Irrigation Canal and many original large and small rivers on the south bank of the main irrigation canal, initially forming an irrigation system. According to statistics from Huaian, Huaiyin, Funing, and Sheyang counties in northern Jiangsu Province, the irrigated area has expanded by approximately more than 1 million mu. In the past, many paddy fields on the south bank of the main irrigation canal often could not be transplanted due to lack of water, and sometimes the newly transplanted seedlings would die from drought. After the irrigation diversion rivers were excavated, the water from the main irrigation canal flowed continuously into the paddy fields. The farmers happily called these newly opened diversion rivers "bumper harvest rivers." Now many farmers are busy installing waterwheels to prepare for rice transplanting. This year, the area planted with rice on the south bank of the Subei Main Irrigation Canal will be greatly increased compared with previous years. In Guo Shu District of Funing County alone, about 400 mu of rice has been restored and replanted.

    洪泽湖畔的三河闸和高良涧进水闸放水
    江苏省北部一千多万亩水稻田得到灌溉
    【新华社南京十九日电】五月十五日，洪泽湖畔的三河闸和高良涧进水闸开放，洪泽湖的水循着一个巨大的灌溉网流进江苏省北部里下河地区。十多个县的一千多万亩水稻田得到灌溉。这在里下河地区的历史上，是第一次按照农田需要放水灌溉。这次高良涧进水闸放出二百个秒公方流量的水进入灌溉总渠和西干渠（里运河），三河闸放出七百个秒公方流量的水进入宝应湖、高邮湖、邵伯湖，再进入南干渠（通扬运河）和西干渠的南段。所有干渠沿岸的几十座大小涵闸都在十五日前后开放，穿过闸孔的急流，激起一团白色浪花以后，便沿着千百条引河流向绿色的田野。现在，当地农民都忙着准备插秧。高邮县一熟水田已耕完一遍，百分之三十的水田已耕完两遍。宝应、盐城、兴化等县农民已准备好百分之八十的稻田基肥。过去当地农民因怕旱涝灾害，都栽种生长时间短产量低的水稻。今年各地普遍推广了“南特号”、“胜利籼”等良种水稻。
    江苏省北部里下河地区过去在插秧季节缺水灌溉，运河断航；秋收季节淮水又泛滥成灾，眼看成熟的庄稼被大水浸没。解放后江苏省北部地区人民热情地参加了伟大的治淮工程和当地的水利工程，先后修整了洪泽湖大堤、运河大堤，开挖了横贯江苏省北部的灌溉总渠，并使灌溉总渠和西干渠、南干渠首尾相连，同时建筑了三河闸、高良涧进水闸、运东分水闸、淮安节制闸等调节水位。这就初步形成一个巨大的农田灌溉网，使江苏省北部里下河地区真正成为富饶的粮仓。
    【新华社蚌埠十九日电】淮河下游沿着苏北灌溉总渠南岸新开的十五条灌溉引河已经完工。这十五条引河把苏北灌溉总渠和灌溉总渠南岸许多原有的大小河道连接起来，初步形成了一个灌溉系统。据江苏省北部淮安、淮阴、阜宁、射阳四个县统计，灌溉面积扩大了约一百多万亩。过去灌溉总渠南岸的许多稻田由于缺乏水源，经常无法插秧，有时新插的秧苗也活活干死。灌溉引河开挖后，灌溉总渠的水源源流进稻田，农民欢欣地叫这些新开的引河为“丰产河”。现在很多农民正忙着安装水车，准备插秧。今年苏北灌溉总渠南岸种植水稻的面积将比往年大大增加，仅阜宁县郭墅区就恢复和改种水稻约四百亩。
