Southwest China News Station: Various localities in the Southwest region are emphasizing leadership in manure accumulation. This spring, the amount of manure accumulated in most areas has increased by 20% compared to the same period last year, with some areas exceeding a 100% increase. In early March, the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee in Sichuan Province held an enlarged cadre meeting to summarize and exchange experiences in leading manure accumulation in various places, making the movement more extensive and in-depth. In Shuangliu County of the district, most villages convened meetings of mutual aid team leaders to develop more than 20 methods for accumulating manure, mobilizing the masses to open up sources of fertilizer. Each village in the county accumulated 500,000 to 600,000 jin of fertilizer, with some accumulating as much as 1 million jin. Taiping Township in Huayang County launched a manure accumulation competition based on mutual aid teams. In less than a month, the entire township accumulated 950,000 dan of manure, averaging 32 dan of compost per mu of land, doubling the amount from last year. In the Jiangjin and Daxian special districts, leaders of Party and government at all levels helped farmers solve the problem of pig feed, increasing the number of pigs raised. In Donglin Village, Linshui County, the 161 households originally raised only 462 pigs, but now the number has increased to 566, which will enable them to accumulate more than 1 million jin of fertilizer before transplanting rice seedlings. A survey in Sansui County, Guizhou Province, showed that the three administrative groups in Liangshang Village accumulated 2,760 jin of fertilizer per mu of land, and even the least, Ningshan Village, accumulated 585 jin per mu. The 24 mutual aid teams in Dianzi Township, Langdai County, increased fertilizer accumulation by 60% compared to the same period last year. Yunnan Province conducted thorough inspections during spring plowing, promoting manure accumulation work in various places. The Yiliang, Yuxi, Dali, Qujing, and Chuxiong special districts all saw an increase in manure accumulation of 20% compared to the same period last year.

    西南区各地重视领导积肥工作
    西南各地重视积肥工作的领导，今春大部地区积肥量比去年同期增加百分之二十，少数地区超过一倍以上。中共四川省温江地委会在三月上旬地委扩大干部会议上，总结交流各地领导积肥的经验，使运动更加广泛和深入。该区双流县多数村曾召开互助组长会议，研究出二十多种积肥办法，发动群众开辟肥源，全县每村都积肥五、六十万斤，有的多达一百多万斤。华阳县太平乡以互助组为基础展开积肥竞赛，不到一月全乡积肥九十五万挑，平均每亩田可施堆肥三十二挑，比去年增加一倍。江津、达县两专区，由于各级党政领导机关帮助农民解决猪食问题，增加了养猪数量，邻水县城乡东林村一百六十一户原只养猪四百六十二只，现已增至五百六十六只，在插秧前可增积百多万斤肥料。贵州三穗县调查，梁上村三个行政组每亩田积肥二千七百六十斤，最少的狞山村每亩积肥也达五百八十五斤。郎岱县店子乡二十四个互助组较去年同期增加肥料百分之六十。云南省春耕中深入检查，推动了各地积肥工作，宜良、玉溪、大理、曲靖、楚雄等专区均比去年同期积肥量增加百分之二十。
