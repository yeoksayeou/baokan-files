    Recollections

    Before liberation, I don't know how many times I ran to the factory, but I couldn't get in because my family didn't have money to give the manager as a bribe. In November 1949, I finally saw the light of day, and I entered the factory.

    After I arrived at the factory, I often thought to myself: I must work hard. When I was learning to be an apprentice worker, I remembered clearly every move the technical teacher made when he taught us how to mend broken ends and tie knots, but when I did it myself, it wasn't as skillful. At that time, I anxiously thought:
   "When will I have the teacher's skilled technique, and when will I be able to watch over the machines myself?" During breaks, I didn't rest, but ran to the machines and practiced the techniques the teacher had taught. During these three months, the teacher often tested our learned skills to understand the learning situation of each apprentice worker, seeing who was more skilled, so that we could be assigned work after our apprenticeship period expired. After each test, I had tied the most knots and mastered the machine parts relatively skillfully.

    Three months later, we were officially assigned work. The teacher told me to watch three hundred spindles. At that time, I was very afraid, because even the old workers only watched four hundred spindles. I had only studied for three months, and they were letting me watch so many, I was really worried. But then I thought, being afraid is useless, I am determined to keep watching. When working the day shift, watching so many spindles wasn't very tiring, and my confidence slowly increased. However, the first time I worked the night shift, the machine created a lot of waste, and I was severely criticized by the technicians. At that time, I was very sad—it was my unhappiest day. At that time, because I was young (fourteen years old), I only knew how to play during the day and didn't go to sleep. Therefore, as soon as I went to work, I couldn't do it, my upper and lower eyelids wouldn't stay apart, and I couldn't tie the knots, the more I couldn't tie them, the more waste was created (many broken ends, unable to spin into thread). After the technician criticized me, I drew a question mark in my mind: Why is this happening? How much wealth have I wasted for the country? I also recalled the situation of not being able to get into the factory in the past. Now that I've entered my own factory, I'm starting like this, can this be allowed? The technician's criticism was right. That morning, I went home and lay down without even eating. I wondered what method I could use to keep the machine from creating waste? After thinking for a long time, I finally came up with a few methods: get enough sleep, keep my eyes wide open when working, never doze off, and watch the broken ends carefully.

    When I arrived at the factory that evening, I became nervous when I saw my machine, my eyes felt particularly bright, and I saw a broken end on the machine and immediately ran over to tie it. After a period of study, my speed of tying knots increased, and I mastered the machine skillfully. I often took the time to observe the old workers, seeing that they tied knots much faster than I did. I was very puzzled: Why are they so fast? From that moment on, I began to observe carefully and finally found the secret: the thread should be pulled short when tying knots. After finding this trick, I practiced it frequently, and my technique improved greatly. At the same time, I continued to observe the technical operations of each old worker and learn from their strengths. While watching the machine, I also constantly observed every part, large and small, on the machine. If it was broken, I immediately looked for the maintenance worker (technician) to repair it; at the same time, I stood next to him and watched carefully, learning simple repair methods, so that if it broke again, I could fix it myself, so as to reduce idle spindles and spin more thread.

    Next, I learned other actions, such as tying knots, changing rovings, sweeping the floor, wiping the clearer boards, pushing the bobbin boxes, and doing cleaning work on and under the machine. In the past, to complete an action, we had to go around the machine, which was tiring, wasted time, and didn't improve the efficiency of watching the spindles. In order to reduce the flying lint in the workshop and reduce broken ends, the factory required everyone to do a good job of cleaning on and under the machines (checked once every day at 2 pm). However, some old workers didn't value this matter, saying, "We've been workers for ten or twenty years, and there's never been any cleaning work!" Therefore, when it came time for inspection, they hurriedly dealt with it, and they didn't care if the machine had broken ends, causing great waste. While watching the machine, I paid attention to studying and improving working methods. Once, I unconsciously combined the two actions of tying knots and wiping the clearer boards. Another time, when it was almost doffing time, because time was short, I didn't have time to do a lot of preparatory work, so I combined the three actions of sweeping the floor, pushing the bobbin boxes, and tying knots. After doing it, I thought to myself, this method is very good; it saves time compared to running three times. So I continued to study it, trying to combine tying knots, wiping the clearer boards, pushing the bobbin boxes, sweeping the floor, and other actions to do together. I was very happy that this working method saved me a lot of time, and it also increased the number of spindles I watched (from watching three hundred spindles to watching six hundred spindles, and the amount of waste produced was also relatively small).

    In my work, I also encountered many other difficulties. For example, I was often hit in the foot by the bobbin boxes or burned by the machine, but strangely enough, I didn't feel any pain at the time. I always thought that when doing any unfamiliar work, this kind of phenomenon is unavoidable. Gradually, I became more and more familiar with the work, and I had a lot of spare time in my work, so I allocated the time according to my personal work situation: I put the cleaning work in each row of yarn, and patrolled the machine rows regularly, combining several actions as much as possible during the patrol, and paying attention to checking the machine for problems in time. After mastering these rules, I worked much easier, and the work efficiency continued to improve, and the amount of waste produced was many times less than that of ordinary machine operators.

    This caused dissatisfaction among everyone. Every time after weighing the waste and writing each person's score on the machine, some young workers or old workers would run to me to look, and after looking, they would pout at me, squint their eyes, and grumble in their mouths. Once, when I was working in the machine row, an old worker loudly said, "This little girl must be playing tricks!" He also said to others, "She must have thrown the waste into the toilet, otherwise she could never produce so little. I've been working for twenty years, and I've never produced so little waste." From then on, several times a lot of waste was found on top of my machine, in my machine box, and under my machine. I didn't know who threw it there. As soon as I saw it, I picked it up without saying a word and counted it as my own waste. Once, someone came to me with some waste and said, "Who told you to throw away the waste? This is the country's property!" I was shocked and silently took the waste without saying anything. I was greatly stimulated at the time. I thought we were all producing for the country, why would they do this?

    Just when my thoughts were conflicting, the party and youth league branch secretaries in the workshop kept talking to me, educating me, and enlightening me: "Now, our working class is in charge. The factory is our own, and we must manage it well; we must create more wealth for the country to build our motherland." They also said that many people want to make new clothes and hope that we will weave more cloth for them. Therefore, it is not enough to rely on one person, we must unite everyone to work together. From then on, my thinking changed, and I was determined to unite everyone.

    After the reason why I produced less waste was publicly announced, several times, comrades didn't eat with me; some people sarcastically said to me when they saw me, "You're competing to be a model." At that time, I didn't understand the meaning of the two words "model" and felt very strange. They didn't walk home with me after work either. I thought about it all the time when I went home to sleep: What method can I use to get together with everyone? After that, every time I ate, I ran to places where there were many people, but I couldn't speak, I didn't know what to say that everyone would like to hear, I could only help everyone do something. For example, if I saw that someone didn't have water in their bowl, I would quickly bring it to them. Several times, old workers left their machines and went to the nursery, without asking someone else to watch them, so there were many broken ends and more waste was produced; they had to be busy for a while when they came back. Every time I saw them leave, I quickly ran to their machine row to watch it for them; when I saw them coming back, I went back to my machine row. When they came back and saw it, they were surprised, the machine was very clean and there were no broken ends. They didn't know who was watching it for them. Later, they found out that I was watching it for them, and they took the initiative to ask me, "How do you watch the machine? Why do you produce so little waste?" I answered them one by one; if they didn't know something, I would study it with them; at the same time, I asked them to teach me techniques, and they smiled and said, "Okay." After hearing this "okay," I felt relieved. After I watched the machine well, I ran to their machine rows to learn when I had time. They also taught me carefully, so that I quickly mastered the method of tying knots quickly. An old worker next to me dozed off while working the night shift. After he tied the knots, he ran outside to sit and sleep. When I saw that there were broken ends on his machine, I would first go to his machine to tie the knots before calling him back. Another time, it rained when work ended, and an elderly worker couldn't go home because he didn't have a raincoat, so I gave him my raincoat to wear, and my whole body got wet. He was very moved and treated me as his own younger sister, and he told me his technical experience of more than twenty years. Therefore, my technique improved, from watching three hundred spindles to watching six hundred spindles. From this, I realized that the power of everyone is infinite.

    I deeply realize that I have been able to achieve such results because of the cultivation and education of the Party and the Youth League, and the help of everyone. In the future, I must complete the learning tasks assigned to me by the Party and the motherland and improve my political and cultural level.

    回忆
    郝建秀
    解放以前，我这腿不知跑了多少趟工厂，就是进不去，因为我家里没有钱给经理送礼。一九四九年十一月我终于见到了天，我进了工厂。
    我到厂以后，经常这样想：我一定要好好干。我在学养成工的时候，技术老师教我们怎样弄断头和接头时，他的一举一动我都记得清清楚楚，可是自己做起来却不是那样熟练。当时我着急地想：
  “什么时候能有老师那样熟练的技术，自己什么时候才能看起机器来呢？”休息时我也不休息，跑到机器跟前，练习老师所教的技术。在这三个月当中，老师经常考我们所学的技术，了解每一个养成工的学习情形，看谁比较熟练，到我们养成期满后好分配工作。每一次考完后，我接的头最多，掌握机器的零件也比较熟练。
    三个月后，我们就正式的分配工作了。老师叫我看三百个锭子。当时我是很害怕的，因为老工人也才看四百个锭子。我才学习了三个月就让我看这么多，实在耽心。但是我又想，害怕是没有用处的，决心要看下去。在值白班时，看这样多锭子还不很累，我的信心也就慢慢加强起来了。但是，头一次上夜班时，车子上放了大花，受到技术人员的严厉批评，当时我很难过——是我最不高兴的一天。那时我因年纪小（十四岁）白天光知道玩，不去睡觉。因此，一到上班就不行了，上眼皮和下眼皮就分不开家了，接头也接不上，越接不上越放花（断头很多，纺不成线）。技术员批评后，我就在思想上画了一个问号：为什么会这样呢？给国家浪费了多少财富？我还回想到过去捞不到进厂的情景，现在进了自己的工厂，一开始就这样，这还行吗？技术人员的批评是应该的。那天早上我回家饭也没有吃就躺下了。我心想用什么办法能叫车子不放花呢？想了半天，终于想了几个办法：睡好觉，上班时把眼睁得大些，永远也不打盹，好好看着断头。
    晚上我一到厂，看见我那机器就紧张起来，我的眼睛感到特别的亮，车上断一个头马上就看见了，就快跑过去接起来。经过一个时期的学习，我接头的速度快了，掌握车子也熟练了。我常常抽空看看老工人，见他们接头比我快得多。我很纳闷：为什么这样快呢？从这时开始，我就经常细致地观察，终于找到了秘密：接头时要拉线短。找到这个窍门后，我经常地练习，把我的技术向前提高了一大步。同时我继续观察每一个老工人的技术操作，学习他们的长处。我在看车中，还不断地观察车子上每一个大小的零件，要是它坏了，我马上找保全工（技术工）来修理；同时，我站在旁边仔细地看着，学会简便的修理方法，如果再坏时，我自己来动手修理，这样就可以减少空锭子，多纺线。
    接着，我又学习其他的动作，如接头，换粗纱，扫地，打擦板，推木管盒子，以及做车上和车下的清洁工作。过去，我们完成一个动作，必须围着车转一圈，既累人又浪费时间，还提不高看锭的效率。为了减少车间的飞花，减少断头，工厂方面要求大家做好车上和车下的清洁工作（每天下午二时检查一次）。但是，有的老工人不看重这件事，说：“我们当了一二十年的工人，都没有什么清洁工作！”因此他们到检查时，就急急忙忙应付一下，车上断了头也不管，造成了大的浪费。我在看车中注意研究改进工作方法。有一次，我不知不觉地把接头和打擦板两个动作结合起来了。又有一次在快要落纱的时候，因为时间仓促，我来不及做好许多准备工作，就把扫地、推木管盒子、接头三个动作结合到一块作。做完后，我想了想，这个办法是很好的；比跑三趟省时间。于是我就继续钻研下去，试着把接头、打擦板、推木管盒子、扫地等动作结合一起来干。我真高兴，这个工作方法给我节省了很多的时间，同时也增加了看锭子的数量（由看三百个锭子提高到看六百个锭子，出的白花也比较少）。
    在工作中我也碰到不少其他的困难。例如，经常被木管盒子砸着脚或者被机器烫了，但是说来也怪，当时一点也不感觉痛。我总想，做任何不熟的工作，乍开始这种现象是免不了的。慢慢地我对工作越来越熟悉了，在工作中有了很多空余时间，我就按着我个人的工作情况，把时间分配了一下：将清洁工作放在每一排纱间进行，有规律地巡回车档，在巡回中尽可能地将几个动作结合在一起进行，并注意及时检查车子的毛病。掌握了这些规律以后，我干起活来可轻松多了，工作效率也不断地提高，出的白花比一般看车工少了好多倍。
    这样就引起了大家对我的不满。每到过完磅，把每一个人的成绩写在车头上时，有的青工或老年工人都跑到我这里来看，看完就向我噘嘴、斜眼，口里咕噜着。有一回，我在车档工作时，有一个老工人大声地说：“你这小嫚一定是耍鬼！”他还对别人说：“她一定把白花丢到厕所去了，要不决不能出那样少。我干二十多年了，没有出那样少的花”。从此以后，我的车顶上和车箱子里，车底下曾有几次发现好多白花，我也不知道谁给我扔的，我一看见就把它拿起来，也不啃声，算我自己出的白花。有一次，有一个人拿着一些白花来找我，说：“谁叫你把白花扔了，这是国家的资财啊！”我吃了一惊，也没有说默默地把白花接过来了。当时我是受了很大刺激，我想我们都是给国家生产，为什么要这样做呢？
    正当我的思想发生矛盾的时候，车间党和团支部书记不断地和我谈话，教育我，启发我：“现在，我们工人阶级当家做了主。厂子是我们自己的，我们要很好地管理它；要多给国家创造财富，来建设我们的祖国。”还说，有不少人都要做新衣裳，希望着我们给他们织出更多的布，因此光靠一个人干是不行的，必须团结大家一起来干。从这以后，我的思想就转变过来了，决心要团结大家。
    我出白花少的原因公开宣布以后，有几次，同志们都不和我在一块吃饭；有人见了我就讽刺地说：“争大模范了。”当时我不明白“模范”这两个字的意义，感到很奇怪。下班时他们也不和我一块走。我回家睡觉时光想：用什么办法和大家合到一起呢？以后每次吃饭时，我跑到人多的地方去，但我不会说话，不知道说什么话大家愿意听，只能帮大家做点事。例如，看见那一个人碗里没有水，我就赶快给他去端来。有几次，老工人把车子扔下到托儿所去了，没有找别人给他看，因此断头很多，出的白花更多；回来他还得忙上一会。每次看到他走了，我赶快跑到他车档去给他看着；见他来了，我就回到我车档去了。他回来一看，很惊奇，车子很干净，也不断头，他不知道谁给他看的，后来他们发现是我给他们看的，他们就主动找我问：“你是怎样看的车？为什么出的白花那样少？我就一一回答了他们；有不知道的，就和他们在一块研究；同时，我要求他们教我技术，他们笑着说：“好”。我听了这个“好”以后，感到轻松了。我把车子看好后，有时间就跑到他们车档里去学。他们也很仔细地教我，使我很快地就掌握了接头快的方法。和我挨着的一个老工人，打夜班时光打盹，他接好了头就跑到外边坐着睡。我看见他车上断头后就先到他车子上把头接好，再去叫回他来。又有一次下班时天落了雨，一个老年工人因没有雨衣不能回家，我就把我的雨衣给他穿着，我的全身都淋湿了。他非常感动，把我当作他的亲妹妹，同时把他二十多年的技术经验告诉了我。因此，我的技术提高了，从看三百个锭子增加到看六百个锭子。从这里我认识到大家的力量是无穷的。
    我深深体会到，我能够得到这样的成绩，都是由于党和青年团的培养和教育，和大家的帮助。今后，我一定要完成党和祖国交给我的学习任务，提高自己的政治文化水平。
