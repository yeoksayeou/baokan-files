The grassroots elections in the Central South Region were victoriously completed in 98 percent of the region's population and grassroots units by May 16th. Only a small number of grassroots units in Guangdong Province are still continuing, and it is expected that all will be completed by May 25th. During this election, thanks to the importance attached to it by the Party and government leaders at all levels and the correct implementation of policies, the broad masses of male and female voters earnestly and solemnly exercised their civil rights and enthusiastically participated in the election. According to preliminary statistics, the number of people participating in the election generally reached 85 percent of the total number of voters, and some even reached over 90 percent. Shaoshan Township in Hunan, the hometown of Chairman Mao, even reached 100 percent.

In this election, many industrial labor models and advanced figures in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement were unanimously supported and trusted by the voters and were honorably elected as people's representatives. Peng Yangqin, Zhu Jiu, Ma Kefang, Fu Jingwen, and Zhu Zaodi, all special-grade industrial labor models in Wuhan City, Zhang Jiying, a national typesetting expert from Henan Province, and the chairmen of the original 41 agricultural production cooperatives in Chenggao County, Henan Province, were all elected as people's representatives. A considerable number of women were also elected as representatives. For example, women representatives accounted for 28 percent of the people's representatives in Guangzhou's urban districts. In minority areas, all ethnic groups elected representatives commensurate with their status. For example, among the 67 representatives elected in the Duan Yao Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province, there were 37 Yao people, 17 Zhuang people, and 13 Han people, including 19 women. In the hometowns of overseas Chinese, an appropriate number of representatives of overseas Chinese families were elected. According to statistics from nine townships in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, where there are many overseas Chinese, 39 overseas Chinese family members were elected as representatives and 13 were elected as members of the township people's government. Through the election, many grassroots regimes have been consolidated, strengthened, and improved. Simultaneously with the grassroots elections, the region successfully completed the population census.

    中南区基层选举工作基本完成
    中南区的基层选举，至五月十六日止，已在全区百分之九十八的人口和基层单位中胜利完成。目前仅有广东省很少一部分基层单位，还正在继续进行，预计在五月二十五日以前，可以全部结束。在这次选举中，由于各级党、政领导的重视，正确地贯彻了政策，广大男女选民都认真严肃地行使了自己的公民权利，热烈地参加了选举。据初步统计，各地参加选举的人数一般都达到了选民总数的百分之八十五，有的还达到百分之九十以上，毛主席的故乡湖南韶山乡更达到了百分之百。
    在这次选举中，许多工业劳动模范和农业互助合作运动中的先进人物，都受到了选民的一致拥护和信任，光荣地当选为人民代表。武汉市工业特等劳动模范彭仰钦、朱玖、马可芳、傅景文、朱早弟，河南省的全国排字能手张继英以及原河南省成皋县四十一个农业生产合作社的社长等，都当选了人民代表。妇女当选为代表的也有相当数量。如广州市区人民代表中，妇女代表占百分之二十八。在少数民族地区，各民族都选出了与其地位相适应的代表。如广西省都安县七百?瑶族自治区选出的六十七名代表中，有瑶族三十七人，僮族十七人，汉族十三人，其中有妇女十九人。在华侨的家乡，则选出了适当名额的侨属代表。据华侨较多的广东省台山县九个乡的统计，侨属当选代表的有三十九人，当选乡人民政府委员的十三人。通过选举，很多基层政权得到整顿、巩固和提高。与基层选举同时，全区胜利地完成了人口调查工作。
