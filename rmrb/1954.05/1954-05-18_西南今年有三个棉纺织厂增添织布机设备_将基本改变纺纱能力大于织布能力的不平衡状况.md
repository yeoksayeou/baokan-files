Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 17th: This year, two joint state-private and one local state-owned cotton textile factories in Southwest China are undergoing expansion, adding weaving machine equipment. The joint state-private Chongqing 610 Cotton Textile Factory's automatic loom factory, which was completed and put into production last year, will add another 528 looms this year. The Chongqing Joint State-Private Yuhua Textile Factory will also add more than 500 looms. In order to supply the ethnic minorities in the Yunnan border region with the cloth they need, the local state-owned Yunnan Textile Factory is also preparing to expand a 500-loom factory. After these projects are completed, the annual production of cloth, calculated at two zhang per person per year, can supply more than six million people.

	The expansion projects of these textile factories are all carried out according to the principle of low investment and quick results. For example, the 610 loom factory, which is currently being expanded, only needs half of the original investment to add the same number of looms, using the original factory buildings and auxiliary workshops and other equipment. The funds used for the expansion of the Yuhua Textile Factory are also only about three-quarters of the construction cost of the 610 loom factory last year, and the time can also be shortened by one-third. Moreover, the expanded factory buildings will all be reinforced concrete structures with better ventilation, cooling, spraying and other equipment. These newly installed machines are also new-style automatic looms with good performance manufactured by our own textile machinery manufacturing plants.

	In the past few years, through renovation and expansion, the textile industry in Southwest China has brought its potential into play, and the production of cotton yarn has increased a lot. However, in the past, there was no modern textile factory in the entire region, and the equipment for spinning and weaving was unbalanced. Therefore, most of the cotton yarn had to be transported to Shanghai and other places to be woven into cloth and then transported back to Southwest China. Last year, the first automatic loom factory in Southwest China—the automatic loom factory of Chongqing 610 Cotton Textile Factory—was put into production, initially changing this unreasonable phenomenon. After these expanded cloth factories are put into production this year, the imbalance of spinning capacity exceeding weaving capacity in Southwest China will be fundamentally changed, so that the people of Southwest China can obtain more cloth locally. These expansion projects of the textile industry in Southwest China continue to receive support from the Shanghai textile industry department. At present, the first batch of more than 1,000 new-style automatic looms have arrived in Chongqing.

### 西南今年有三个棉纺织厂增添织布机设备  将基本改变纺纱能力大于织布能力的不平衡状况

    西南今年有三个棉纺织厂增添织布机设备
    将基本改变纺纱能力大于织布能力的不平衡状况
    【新华社重庆十七日电】西南区今年有两个公私合营和一个地方国营的棉纺织厂进行扩建，增添织布机设备。已经在去年建成投入生产的公私合营重庆六一零棉纺织厂的自动织布机厂，今年将再增加五百二十八台布机。重庆公私合营裕华纺织厂也将增加五百多台织布机。为了供应云南边疆各民族人民需要的布匹，今年地方国营云南纺织厂也正在准备扩建五百台布机的布厂一座。这些工程完工后，每年生产的布匹如果按每人每年两丈计算，可供六百多万人穿用。
    这些纺织厂的扩建工程都是根据投资少、效果快的原则进行的。如正在扩建的六一零织布机厂，在利用原有厂房和辅助车间等设备的条件下，只用原来投资数目的一半，就添设了同样台数的布机。扩建的裕华纺织厂所用资金也只有去年六一零织布机厂建设费用的四分之三左右，在时间上也可以缩短三分之一。并且这些扩建的厂房将全部是钢筋混凝土结构，有着较好的通风、降温、喷雾等设备。这些新置的机器，也都是我国纺织机器制造厂自己制造的性能良好的新式自动布机。
    几年来，西南纺织工业经过改建、扩建，发挥了潜在能力，棉纱的生产量增加了很多。但过去全区没有一个现代化的纺织工厂，纺纱和织布的设备不平衡，因此要把大部分棉纱运到上海等地织成布后再运回西南。去年西南第一座自动布机布厂——重庆六一零棉纺织厂的自动织布机厂投入生产，初步改变了这种不合理现象。今年这些扩建的布厂投入生产后，将基本改变西南纺纱能力大于织布能力的不平衡状况，使西南人民能从当地得到更多的布匹。西南纺织工业的这些扩建工程继续得到上海纺织工业部门的支援。现在，首批一千多台新式自动布机已经运抵重庆。
