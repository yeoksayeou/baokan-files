Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: "Izvestia" published dispatches from its reporters Mikhailov and Polyanov in Geneva, under the title "Behind-the-Scenes Activities of Bourgeois Diplomacy."

The reporters wrote: The era of unbridled behavior by diplomats from imperialist countries is over. Precisely because of this, enemies of international cooperation, in order to achieve their goals and prevent the easing of international tensions, spare no effort—from behind-the-scenes conspiracies to fabrications, from intimidating their junior partners to deceiving public opinion.

The headquarters of bourgeois diplomats in Geneva is the Hotel Rhone, where the U.S. delegation resides. Here, secret press conferences are held almost every morning to instruct American journalists on how to most skillfully deceive the public. It is also here that representatives of the sixteen countries participating in the aggression against the Korean people often hold secret meetings.

The reporters then exposed the rumors spread by American diplomats and their accomplices, especially the fabricated lies about "Chinese and Soviet infiltration into Indochina."

The reporters wrote: At the conference table in the Palais des Nations, Western diplomats—primarily American and French diplomats—repeatedly said that they hoped to restore peace in Indochina. However, outside the walls of this building, they were frantically working to pave the way for continuing the Indochina war, expanding American intervention in the war, and establishing an aggressive bloc of colonial countries against the Asian people.

Behind-the-scenes meetings of bourgeois diplomats were held one after another. At the request of Washington, the United States and France began separate negotiations. Subsequently, the "member states of the Federation"—Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia—were also drawn into this vortex of negotiations. It is reported that Thai Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon and certain other diplomats also participated in these separate negotiations.

What is the purpose of these behind-the-scenes negotiations? According to Western newspaper commentaries, the enemies of peace intend to use these negotiations to resist the Geneva Conference and thereby obstruct its work. They also want to use threats of strengthening the connection between Washington and Bao Dai as a means of coercion to force France to join the planned Pacific bloc, which the United States intends to control single-handedly. Their idea is that the members of this bloc should initially include at least the United States, France, the "member states of the Federation," and Thailand, in order to use it to exert pressure on Britain and the various countries within the British Empire.

These are some characteristics of the despicable double-dealing played by those who are hostile to easing international tensions, who are trying their best to prevent the Geneva Conference from completing the important tasks of resolving the Korean issue and restoring peace in Indochina.

The reporters concluded by saying that, however, the instigators of these tricks were mistaken on one point: they originally thought that they could conceal their true intentions from the public and keep their imperialist dealings secret. But now times have completely changed. The unwavering struggle of democratic countries for peace has exposed the true faces of the imperialist diplomatic conspirators.

    资产阶级外交的幕后活动
    ——“消息报”发表的日内瓦通讯的摘要
     【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：“消息报”刊载了记者米哈伊洛夫和波利扬诺夫的日内瓦来电，题目是“资产阶级外交的幕后活动”。
    记者写道：帝国主义国家的外交家们横行无忌的时代已经过去了。正是因为这样，国际合作的敌人为了达到他们的目的，为了阻止缓和国际紧张局势，不惜使用一切手段——从幕后的阴谋活动到虚构捏造，从恐吓他们的小伙伴到欺骗舆论。
    资产阶级外交家在日内瓦的大本营是美国代表团所住的罗尼饭店。在这里，几乎每天早晨都举行秘密的记者招待会，向美国记者布置如何最巧妙地欺骗公众。也就是在这里，参加对朝鲜人民的侵略的十六个国家的代表们常常举行秘密会议。
    记者接着揭发了美国外交家和他们的同伙们的造谣，特别是无中生有的关于“中国和苏联渗入印度支那”的谎话。
    记者写道：在国联大厦的会议桌上，西方外交家——首先是美国和法国外交家——一再重复说，他们希望恢复印度支那的和平。但是，在这个大厦的墙壁外面，他们却在疯狂地活动，企图为继续印度支那战争、扩大美国对这个战争的干涉以及建立反对亚洲人民的殖民国家的侵略集团铺平道路。
    资产阶级外交家的幕后会议一个接着一个地举行。由于华盛顿的要求，美国和法国开始了单独的谈判。接着，“联邦成员国”——越南、寮国和高棉——也被卷入了这个谈判的漩涡。据悉，泰国外交部长威泰耶康以及其他某些外交家也参加了这个单独的谈判。
    这些幕后谈判的目的何在呢？根据西方报纸的评论，和平的敌人打算利用这些谈判来抵制日内瓦会议，并借此阻碍它的工作。他们也想用扬言加强华盛顿和保大的联系作为恐吓手段，来胁迫法国加入策划中的太平洋集团，这个集团是美国打算一手控制的。他们的主意是：这个集团的成员起初至少应该包括美国、法国、各“联邦成员国”和泰国，以便用它来对英国和英帝国中的各个国家行使压力。
    这就是敌视缓和国际紧张局势的人所玩弄的、卑鄙的两面手法的某些特点，他们正在尽力阻止日内瓦会议完成解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的重大任务。
    记者最后说，然而，这些把戏的主使人在一点上却弄错了：他们原来以为，他们可以向公众隐瞒他们的真正意图，把他们的帝国主义勾当秘密起来。不过现在时代是完全变了。民主国家为争取和平而进行的坚持不渝的斗争，揭破了帝国主义外交阴谋家的嘴脸。
