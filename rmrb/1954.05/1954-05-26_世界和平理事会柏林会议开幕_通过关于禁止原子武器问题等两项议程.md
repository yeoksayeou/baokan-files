Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 24th: According to TASS, the World Peace Council Special Session in Berlin opened here on May 24th. The hall was decorated with doves of peace and the flags of the countries of the peace movement representatives attending the meeting.

Participating in the meeting were delegations from many countries, including the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Italy, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.

The opening session was chaired by Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council. Guo Moruo delivered the opening address to the conference.

After his opening remarks, Guo Moruo informed the delegates that the President of the World Peace Council, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, was unfortunately unable to attend the meeting due to ill health. Guo Moruo suggested sending a telegram to Professor Joliot-Curie to express condolences.

Friedrich Ebert, the Mayor of Greater Berlin, welcomed the delegates on behalf of the citizens of Berlin. He said, "I assure you that this meeting of the World Peace Council will receive the great attention of the citizens of Berlin. My words express the thoughts and opinions of all the citizens of Berlin."

The meeting unanimously adopted the agenda proposed by Jean Laffitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, based on the instructions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council:

	(1) The question of the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.
	(2) The question of international security.

The Chairman then invited Mr. Pritt, President of the British Peace Committee, to speak.

In his speech, Pritt pointed out the various problems facing peace fighters and elaborated on the following four issues: the issue of disarmament, the issue of German and European security, the issue of Far Eastern and Asian security, and the importance of expanding cultural exchanges and trade to improve international relations.

Pritt said that, worldwide, the so-called defense spending of each country is much greater than at any time before the Second World War or in the two years after the war. Although some countries have reduced this spending, on the whole, this spending is increasing year by year. The expansion of armaments is increasingly impoverishing the people, making life increasingly difficult, harming the health of residents, and causing increasingly serious damage to culture. However, unless public opinion rises to force governments to abandon the expansion of armaments, the expansion of armaments will continue. Universal, consistent, supervised, and simultaneous disarmament is undoubtedly the best way to stop the expansion of armaments. Pritt said that we should not be discouraged by seeing that some countries and some powerful groups are obstructing the adoption of a series of proposals and demands aimed at reducing armaments. To achieve victory, there must be pressure from public opinion and a mass movement of people on a large scale. This movement is now constantly rising. Our peace movement is helping it grow and develop.

Pritt then spoke about the issues of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. He said: "The use of such weapons is a violation of international law and constitutes a war crime and a crime against humanity."

Pritt pointed out the importance of international law. He said that international law is still meaningful at present. After the Nuremberg trials, the role and prestige of international law have been particularly enhanced. The Charter of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal supplemented international law. It contains one of the most important principles of international law. This is: the purpose of military action is to defeat the enemy's forces, not to cause losses to all citizens of the belligerent countries. Any injury or damage to life and property that goes beyond this purpose is illegal. In particular, causing harm or suffering to non-combatants is illegal. He said that the Charter of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal did not touch the main principles and subjects of international law established before, but made some important supplements and additions. The first article stipulates that "the massacre of civilians...the destruction of cities or villages and other destruction not justified by military necessity" are war crimes, and the second article stipulates that "the large-scale massacre of any civilians" is a crime against humanity.

Pritt said that what needs to be done now is to find the best way in practice to guide the opinion of the awakened masses to force the governments concerned to implement the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. The 1950 Stockholm Declaration was a good start to launch such public opinion. The movement sparked by the Stockholm Declaration stopped the use of atomic bombs in Korea. However, we are far from achieving full security in this regard.

Speaking on the German issue, Pritt said that the policy that Western countries are currently trying to implement is to perpetuate the division of Germany, deepen anxiety, and increase the danger of war, and is therefore a violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter. Pritt continued: "The main excuse for implementing this policy ultimately boils down to the fact that the Soviet armed forces are said to be in danger of occupying Western Europe. Therefore, Germany and other Western European countries must be rearmed to resist this 'aggression.'" But no one believes this anymore, because there is no indication that the Soviet Union has any aggressive intentions. In fact, preparing for war against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies is the only goal pursued by the policy of remilitarizing West Germany.

Pritt then spoke about the issue of the Far East and the security of Asia as a whole. He emphasized that in Korea and Indochina, it can be clearly seen what consequences have resulted from the colonial policies that have been pursued for decades. Pritt said: "It is difficult to imagine how severe the oppression suffered by the people of these countries is, how much suffering they have endured, and how many sacrifices they have made. However, the people of these countries have also proved that they have great potential to embark on the road to prosperity. Our task is to help them in this regard."

Pritt then spoke about the need to strive for the recognition of the government of the People's Republic of China and to obtain its position in the United Nations.

When talking about the tasks of the peace movement, Pritt believed that it is necessary to: strive for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and a large reduction of various armaments; strive to first solve the most important issues - the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, and the German reunification issue; eliminate the obstacles for countries to establish contacts and cooperation in trade, science, literature, sports, etc.

Pritt concluded by saying that the vast majority of people in countries around the world are fighting with us. Therefore, the happy future we are striving for must belong to us.

After Pritt's speech, the discussion began. Those who spoke in the discussion included: Professor Heino Yoshitaro, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, Professor Leopold Infeld of Poland, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, and General Sahib Singh Sokhey of India, winner of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace."

    世界和平理事会柏林会议开幕
    通过关于禁止原子武器问题等两项议程
    据新华社二十五日讯：据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议于五月二十四日在此间开幕。大厅里装饰着和平鸽，以及参加这次会议的和平运动代表所属国家的国旗。
    参加这次会议的有许多国家的代表团，其中包括苏联、中华人民共和国、法国、英国、印度、意大利、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克。
    开幕会议由世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若担任主席，郭沫若向大会致了开幕词。
    郭沫若在致开幕词后告诉代表们说，世界和平理事会主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里不幸因为健康情况不佳而不能参加会议。郭沫若建议致电约里奥—居里教授表示慰问。
    大柏林市长弗雷德里希·艾柏特代表柏林市民向代表们表示欢迎。他说，我要向你们保证世界和平理事会的这次会议将得到柏林市民的极大注意，我的话表达了全柏林市民的想法与意见。
    会议一致通过世界和平理事会总书记让·拉斐德根据世界和平理事会常务委员会的指示而提出的议程：
    （一）禁止原子与热核子武器问题。
      （二）国际安全问题。
    主席接着请英国和平委员会会长普里特发言。
    普里特在发言中指出和平战士们面前的各种问题，并详细论述了以下四个问题：裁军问题，德国与欧洲安全问题，远东与亚洲安全问题，扩大文化交流与贸易以改进国际关系的重要性。
    普里特说，从整个世界来说，每个国家的所谓防御开支，比第二次世界大战以前任何时候或大战后二年中都要大得多。虽然有一些国家减少了这种开支，但整个说来，这种开支在逐年增加。扩充军备使人民日益破产，生活日益贫困，居民的健康日益遭到损害，文化遭到日益严重的损失。但是，除非舆论起来强迫政府放弃扩充军备，否则扩充军备将继续下去。普遍的、一致的、有监督的、同时的裁军，无疑是停止扩充军备的最好的办法。普里特说，我们不应该由于看到某些国家和某些有势力的集团阻碍采纳一系列的旨在裁减军备的建议与要求而灰心丧气。为了取得胜利，必须要有社会舆论的压力，要有规模巨大的人民群众运动。这种运动现在正不断高涨中。我们的和平运动正在帮助它壮大与发展。
    普里特接着谈到原子武器与氢武器的问题。他说：采用这种武器就是破坏国际法，就是犯了战争罪与反人道的罪行。
    普里特指出了国际法的重要性。他说，国际法目前仍是有意义的，经过纽伦堡审判后，国际法的作用和威信特别提高了。纽伦堡国际军事法庭宪章使国际法得到了补充。其中包含着最重要的国际法原则之一。这就是：军事行动的目的在于击溃敌人的力量，而不是使交战国的全体公民都蒙受损失。凡是超出这个目的的范围而对人命和财产有所杀伤和破坏者，均属非法。而使非战斗人员遭受损害或折磨，尤属非法。他说，纽伦堡国际军事法庭宪章没有触动以前所确立的国际法的主要原则和主体，只是作了一些重要的补充和增添。其中第一条规定
  “屠杀平民……毁灭城市或乡村及其他非军事需要的破坏”为战争罪犯，第二条规定“大规模屠杀任何平民”为违反人道罪。
    普里特说，现在所需要做的就是在实际中找到最好的办法，以引导觉醒了的群众的舆论来迫使有关政府实现禁止大规模毁灭性的武器。一九五零年斯德哥尔摩宣言就是展开这样的舆论的一个很好的开端，斯德哥尔摩宣言掀起的运动制止了在朝鲜使用原子弹。但是，我们在这方面远没有获得充分的安全。
    普里特讲到德国问题时说，目前西方国家企图执行的政策是要使德国的分裂永久化，加深不安与加强战争危险，因而是违反联合国宪章的基本原则的。普里特继续说：实行这种政策的主要借口追根到底是：据说苏联武装部队有占领西欧的危险，因此就必须重新武装德国及其他西欧国家，以抵抗这一“侵略”。但是现在谁也不信这一套了，因为没有丝毫的迹象能说明苏联有侵略企图。实际上，准备反对苏联和各人民民主国家的战争，就是使西德重新军国主义化的政策所追求的唯一目标。
  普里特接着谈到远东问题和整个亚洲的安全问题，他着重指出，在朝鲜和印度支那可以很明显地看出，推行了数十年之久的殖民主义政策导致了什么后果。普里特说道：很难想像，这些国家的人民所受的压迫究竟多么严重，他们究竟受了多少的苦难，遭到了多少的牺牲。然而这些国家的人民同时也证明了，他们是有巨大的可能走上繁荣的道路的。我们的任务就是要在这方面帮助他们。
    普里特接着谈到必须争取实现这样的要求：使中华人民共和国政府得到承认，并使其在联合国中获得自己的位置。
    普里特谈到和平运动的任务时，认为必须：争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器和大量裁减各种军备；争取首先解决最重大的问题——朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，德国统一问题；消除各国在贸易、科学、文艺、体育等方面建立联系和合作的障碍。
    普里特最后说，世界各国绝大多数的人民都与我们一起在战斗。因此，我们所争取的幸福的将来一定是属于我们的。
    在普里特发言后，讨论开始。在讨论中发言的有：日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎教授，世界和平理事会副主席波兰的利奥波德·英费尔德教授，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人印度的萨希布·辛格·索克将军。
