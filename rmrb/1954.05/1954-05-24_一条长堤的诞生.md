Standing on the Loving Mother Embankment, my heart is stirred by the fruits of the soldiers' labor. A brand-new embankment stretches into the distance. The river water, which was flowing everywhere just a few days ago, is now obediently flowing along the embankment.

Six days ago, this place was still a vast expanse of water: countless river channels overflowed their banks, flowing through rice paddies and mulberry gardens. The scars left by the American aerial bandits' bombing of the Loving Mother Reservoir last year still remained on this low-lying land.

On March 11th, heavy snow fell, and the earth was frozen. A volunteer army unit arrived. They were going to subdue these river channels, to let the rice paddies grow rice seedlings again, and to let the mulberry gardens be planted with mulberry trees again.

The next day, early in the morning, the massive project began.

	This unit was a multi-ethnic force, with Han soldiers as well as Miao and Yi soldiers. They had spent thirteen months fighting in front of Yuyin Mountain, and had also destroyed the puppet "Capital Division" south of Jin City. The soldiers deeply understood the value of peace and the significance of helping the Korean people rebuild their homes. Regardless of the freezing weather, they quickly took off their gloves, picked up steel picks, and threw themselves into the new battle. The pickaxe hit the ground, making their hands ache, and gravel splashed on their faces, leaving marks of labor. It took several strikes to dig a palm-sized piece of land. Yi soldier Huang Xingfu's palm was blistered, and his back of hand was cracked, with blood oozing from the cracks, but he still dug vigorously. When he first arrived here yesterday, he felt that this depression was very similar to his hometown. His hometown was also a depression, also a rice paddy, but narrower than here. When the rice ears in his hometown were emitting fragrance and rippling with the wind, it was so beautiful! But that good field had often been hit by mountain floods in the past. In May of the year before last, just as the green rice seedlings were about to bloom, a sudden heavy rain washed away all the rice seedlings. His family's fifty *shi* of fields only yielded twenty-six *shi*. Last year, when he joined the army, the people in his hometown had already started to build a dam under the leadership of the People's Government. He estimated that the dam must have been completed by now. At this time, he looked up at the countless river channels and thought: Like my hometown, this place needs a river dam so much! He dug hard, the wind blowing on the cracks on the back of his hand, the blood blisters sticking to the pickaxe handle, and sweat flowing from his wide forehead. In the distance, came the mountain song of the Miao soldiers:

	Not afraid of the March north wind,
	Not afraid of hard soil and firm stones,
	Not afraid of blisters on the palms,
	Not afraid of aching waist and sore legs,
	Steel picks and iron shovels clanging,
	Carrying soil and moving soil, it's a lively scene.
	Building Korea, like building our own home.

But the soldiers were distressed by the slow efficiency.

That night, a solution was devised. The next day, the soldiers first opened the frozen layer, dug out the unfrozen soil from inside, and then knocked down the suspended frozen layer, and adopted a segmented and phased operation method, which quickly improved efficiency.

The soldiers' internationalist spirit deeply moved the local Korean farmers. Young girls came in groups to send boiled water to the construction site, and old women secretly took clothes from the soldiers' backpacks to wash. The chairman and vice-chairman of the *dao* also came to express their sympathy. This meticulous care from the Korean people further encouraged the soldiers.

The Chinese Communist Party branch of the unit put forward the battle slogan: "Where it is hard, where it is frozen, where there is ice, Communist Party members go there!" "Strive to complete the project ahead of schedule!" In the morning, the ground was as hard as a rock, and at noon on a sunny day, the ground turned into mud. Communist Party members led Youth League members and the broad masses of soldiers, in the wind and snow, in the mud, digging and transporting soil, talking and laughing. The Miao soldiers sang with their beautiful mountain melodies:

	Volunteer Army loves peace,
	Resisting America and aiding Korea with determination,
	Defeating the American and Li gangs is not enough,
	We must also help the Korean people build their homes.

A tense labor competition was launched on the construction site. Soldier Luo Yongzhao's feet were swollen, but when blocking the river mouth, he was the first to jump into the water. He said, "I am a Youth League member!" Miao soldier Pan Chengliang was only seventeen years old. A few days ago, during the unit's general election, he was not even qualified to vote. However, now he is working and competing with everyone. Ordinary comrades carried four hundred baskets of soil a day, but he and another soldier could carry four hundred and fifty baskets. He said to me: "We must build Korea like we build our motherland!"

In just six days, the project that was originally scheduled to take twenty days was completed. A long embankment, two thousand five hundred meters long, four point eight meters wide, and one point two meters high, was built.

One morning after the completion, the soldiers came here again, looking at the embankment they had built with their own hands, and the soldiers sang again:

	Twenty-day task of repairing the river dam,
	Completed fourteen days ahead of schedule,
	What force is so great?
	Chinese and Korean people are of one heart.
	Flood control dam is long and long,
	The water in the Longchi River is vast,
	The fierce river water has been tamed,
	People's grain is piled up in warehouses.

At this time, the water in the Loving Mother Reservoir had thawed, and the green water was rippling with small waves. In the distance, the staff of the Longchi River Farm were sorting out more than one million mulberry seedlings, preparing to plant them in the mulberry garden. The soldiers stood on the embankment, talking and gesturing, as if they had already seen the vast and undulating rice waves and the mulberry gardens shaded by green trees. A soldier from Sichuan said to me: "Korea is such a good place, we must help the Korean people build it into a garden!"

### 一条长堤的诞生

    一条长堤的诞生
    马华
    伫立在慈母堤上，我的心被战士们的劳动成果激动着。一条崭新的长堤向远方伸去，几天以前还在到处奔流的河水，现在服服贴贴地沿着长堤流着。
    六天前，这里还是一片汪洋：无数条河道的河水泛滥似地流过了稻田，穿过了桑园。美国空中强盗去年轰炸慈母贮水池的伤痕，还残留在这块洼地上。
    三月十一日，天降大雪，大地封冻着。一支志愿军部队开来了。他们要制服这些河道，要让那稻田再长出稻苗，要让那桑园再植上桑树。
    第二天一清早，巨大的工程就开始了。
      这支部队是一个多民族的部队，有汉族的战士，也有苗族和彝族的战士。他们曾在鱼隐山前度过十三个月的战斗生活，也曾在金城以南捣毁过伪
  “首都师”。战士们深深懂得和平的可贵，帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的意义。他们顾不得天寒地冻，迅速脱下了手套，举起了钢镐，投入了新的战斗。镐刨到地上，把手震得发痛，碎石飞溅在脸上，也留下了劳动的伤痕。几下，才能刨巴掌大的一块土地。彝族战士黄兴福的手掌打了泡，手背也裂了缝，从裂缝渗出了鲜血，但他仍奋力地刨着。他昨天一来到这里，就觉得这块洼地很像他的家乡。他的家乡也是一块洼地，也是一片稻田，只不过比这里狭些。当家乡的稻穗吐着清香随风鼓浪的时候，那是多么美丽啊！可是那大好田园过去也经常受到山洪的冲击。前年五月，眼看那绿油油的稻苗快要吐穗了，突然一场大雨，稻苗全被那无情的山洪吞噬了。他家中的五十石田只留下了二十六石。去年他参军时，家乡群众在人民政府的领导下已经开始修堤了。他估计目前堤一定修成了。这时，他抬头望着那无数的河道，心想：和我的家乡一样，这里多么需要一条河堤啊！他奋力地刨着，风吹着他手背上的裂缝，血泡和镐柄黏在一起，汗水从他那宽大的额上流下来。远处，传来了苗族战士的山歌：
    不怕三月北风寒，
    不怕土硬石头坚，
    不怕手掌磨血泡，
    不怕腰疼腿又酸，
    钢镐铁锹叮噹响，
    挑土担土闹翻了天。
    建设朝鲜，像建设自己的家园。
    但战士们为这缓慢的效率苦恼着。
    这天晚上，办法想出来了。第二天，战士们先把冻层刨开口，从里面掏出没有结冻的土，然后再捣下悬空的冻层，并采用分段分次作业法，效率迅速提高了。
    战士们的国际主义精神，深深感动了当地的朝鲜农民，年青姑娘们成群结伙地往工地上送开水，年老的大娘们偷偷从战士背包里取出衣服去洗，道的正、副委员长也前来慰问他们。朝鲜人民这种无微不至的关怀，更加鼓舞了战士们。
    部队的中国共产党支部提出了“那里硬，那里冻，那里有冰，共产党员到那里去！”“争取提前完工！”的战斗口号。早晨，地冻得像石头一般硬，晴天的中午地面上又化成泥浆。共产党员带领着青年团员和广大战士，在风雪里，在泥浆里，刨着，运着土，说笑着，苗族战士们用那美妙的山歌曲调唱着：
    志愿军啊爱和平，
    抗美援朝有决心，
    打败了美李匪帮还不算，
    又要帮朝鲜人民把家兴。
    紧张的劳动竞赛在工地上开展起来了。战士罗永照的脚肿了，堵河口时，他还是第一个跳下水去。他说：“我是青年团员！”苗族战士潘成良才十七岁，前些日子部队普选时，他还不够选民资格哩，可是，现在他和大家一块劳动着，竞赛着。一般的同志每天抬四百筐土，他和另一个战士却能抬四百五十筐；他对我说：“我们要像建设咱们祖国一样地来建设朝鲜！”
    仅仅六天，就完成了原定二十天才能完成的工程。一条长达两千五百公尺、宽四点八公尺、高一点二公尺的长堤修成了。
    竣工后的一天早晨，战士们又来到这里，眺望着他们双手堆起来的长堤，战士们又唱起来了：
    二十天任务修河堤，
    提前十四天就完成，
    什么力量这样大？
    中朝人民一条心。
    防洪堤来长又长，
    龙池河中水汪洋，
    凶猛的河水已驯服，
    人民的粮食堆满仓。
      这时，慈母贮水池里的水已经解冻，绿色的池水荡漾着微波，远处龙池里农场的工作人员，在整理着百余万株桑苗，准备往桑园里栽种。战士们立在堤上，说着，比划着，好像他们已经看见了那广阔无垠起伏着的稻浪和绿树成荫的桑园一样。一个四川籍的战士对我说：“朝鲜这地方多好啊，我们一定帮助朝鲜人民把它建设成一个花园！”（附图片）
