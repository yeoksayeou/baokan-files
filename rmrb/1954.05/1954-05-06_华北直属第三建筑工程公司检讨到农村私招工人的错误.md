    The North China Directly Subordinate Third Construction Engineering Company Conducts Self-Criticism for the Error of Privately Recruiting Workers in Rural Areas
    Editor's Note: Comrades Liu Ruoshan and Han Chunhai of the Cang County People's Government in Hebei Province wrote a letter criticizing the First Engineering Division of the North China Directly Subordinate Third Construction Engineering Company for privately recruiting construction workers from rural areas. This newspaper has forwarded the letter to the company for investigation and handling. The company's self-criticism is published below:
    Letter from the North China Directly Subordinate Third Construction Engineering Company: After receiving the People's Daily's forwarded letter from Comrade Liu Ruoshan and others criticizing our company for privately recruiting workers from rural areas, we sent people to investigate. The results of the investigation show that there were shortcomings in the First Engineering Division's work of pre-arranging workers. Last year, a large number of strong laborers were transferred from Cang County by the First Engineering Division, and they performed very well in their work. The administrative side of the engineering division decided to select 756 of them as pre-arranged workers. However, because the engineering tasks were not determined at that time, the pre-arrangement certificates were not issued in a timely manner. In February of this year, after the tasks of the First Engineering Division were determined, they contacted these workers directly by letter without contacting the Cang County People's Government. This practice not only violates the government's regulations on planned and organized allocation of labor, but also may make some farmers uneasy about agricultural production, encourage farmers to blindly go out to find work, and make it more difficult for the local People's Government to lead agricultural production. The reasons for this situation are: the First Engineering Division only considered how to complete its own tasks and ignored the impact of doing so on agricultural production; they also mistakenly believed that these workers had worked for the company last year and could be contacted directly, without considering that these workers were recruited from disaster areas last year, and the situation is different this year. Our company's leading cadres usually only pay attention to production, and do not pay enough attention to educating cadres on labor policies. We should also be responsible for the occurrence of this matter. In addition to strictly criticizing the personnel involved, we are determined to learn from this lesson and strengthen the education of our staff to prevent similar situations from happening again.

### 华北直属第三建筑工程公司检讨到农村私招工人的错误

    华北直属第三建筑工程公司检讨到农村私招工人的错误
    编者按：河北沧县人民政府刘若山、韩春海二同志来信，批评华北直属第三建筑工程公司第一工区私自去农村招收建筑工人。本报已转请该公司检查处理，现将该公司的检讨发表于下：
    华北直属第三建筑工程公司来信：我们接到人民日报转来刘若山等同志的对我公司私自去农村招收建筑工人的批评信后，就派人进行了检查。检查结果说明，我公司第一工区预约工人的工作是有缺点的。第一工区去年由沧县调配的大批壮工，在工作中表现很好；工区行政方面就决定从中选择七百五十六人做为预约对象，但因当时工程任务没有确定，未能及时发给预约证。今年二月，第一工区任务确定后，没有和沧县人民政府联系，就直接给这些工人去信预约。这种做法，不但和政府有计划、有组织地调配劳动力的规定有所违背，而且也可能使某些农民不安心于农业生产，助长了农民盲目出外找工作的行动，使当地人民政府领导农业生产时增加了困难。造成这种情况的原因是：第一工区单纯考虑怎样完成本身任务，忽视了这样做会影响农业生产；他们并错误地以为这些工人去年就在公司工作，可以直接联系，而没有考虑到这些工人去年是由灾区招来，而今年情况不同了。我公司领导干部平日只注意生产，而对干部进行劳动政策的教育注意不够，对这件事情的发生也应该负责。我们除已对有关人员进行严格的批评外，并决心接受教训，加强对所属人员的教育，以杜绝类似情况再次发生。
