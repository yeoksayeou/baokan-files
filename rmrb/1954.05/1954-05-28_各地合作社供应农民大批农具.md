Cooperatives in Various Regions Supply Farmers with Large Quantities of Farm Tools

To support spring plowing, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have supplied farmers with large quantities of new and old farm tools. In the first quarter of this year alone, twelve provinces and cities, including Hebei, Liaoxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Beijing, supplied farmers with over 6,234,000 pieces of old-style farm tools. The four provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and Rehe supplied over 16,000 pieces of new-style farm tools. The provinces of Yunnan, Shanxi, and Shandong, along with Beijing, supplied over 12,400 waterwheels. The number of farm tools supplied this year in various regions generally increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The amount of farm tools supplied by Jiangsu Province in the first quarter of this year exceeded more than twice the amount supplied in the first quarter of last year. Yunnan Province increased the supply of iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools by 120% compared to the same period last year, with iron farm tools increasing by two times.

In the operation of small farm tools, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions generally conscientiously implemented the principle of "local materials, local manufacturing, and local supply," and attached importance to entrusting local artisans with processing and ordering. According to statistics from eighty-five counties in Yunnan Province, supply and marketing cooperatives have organized over 11,600 blacksmith furnaces and over 9,400 carpenters and bamboo workers around them. In general areas of the province, 50% of the handicraft products are produced for cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the Minhou and Fu'an special districts of Fujian Province have signed processing and ordering contracts with 258 blacksmith furnaces and over 200 ironware production groups, 49 woodenware production groups, 88 bamboo ware production groups, and 44 palm-fiber raincoat production groups. To facilitate farmers' purchase of farm tools, many grassroots cooperatives have established specialized farm tool outlets. Many cooperatives set up stalls to supply goods when farmers went to markets or temple fairs. Some cooperatives also organized mobile delivery teams to go to the countryside and held small-scale material exhibitions or small-scale material exchange meetings. Grassroots cooperatives in the Tai'an special district of Shandong Province established a total of 106 small farm tool outlets and set up 132 stalls at markets. In addition, according to statistics from eight counties in the special district, there were 25 mobile delivery teams. The fifth district supply and marketing cooperative in Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, supplied over 1,000 pieces of farm tools such as waterwheels and hoes through material exchange meetings, worth over 61 million yuan.

Due to the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the number of new-style farm tools supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions has increased even more this year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong Province have supplied over 8,900 new-style walking plows and over 1,200 waterwheels, most of which were purchased by mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The Yuncheng special district supply and marketing cooperative in Shanxi Province has supplied over 220 new-style walking plows, waterwheels, etc., to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams through combined contracts. When supplying new-style farm tools, supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions, together with agricultural departments, carried out technical training. The Jie County supply and marketing cooperative in Shanxi Province cooperated with agricultural departments to organize three technical teams to go to the countryside to inspect and repair new-style farm tools for farmers. At the same time, it also newly supplied over 80 new-style walking plows and over 500 jin of pesticides. This spring, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments in the Wendeng, Liaocheng, Heze, and Jining special districts of Shandong Province conducted a general inspection and repair of new-style farm tools that had already been supplied to farmers. Each county in the Liaocheng special district also universally established farm tool repair stations. Sixteen such stations have been established in Qingping County alone. Due to the vigorous technical training by supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments, approximately 110,000 people in the Heze special district of Shandong Province have initially mastered the use of new-style farm tools.

    各地合作社供应农民大批农具
    各地供销合作社配合春耕生产，已将大批新式和旧式农具供应到农民手中。今年第一季度，仅河北、辽西、江苏、云南、北京等十二个省、市，即供应给农民旧式农具六百二十三万四千多件；山东、山西、新疆、热河四省供应的新式农具，有一万六千多部；云南、山西、山东三省和北京市供应的水车，有一万二千四百多架。今年各地供应农具的数量，一般比去年同期都增加不少。江苏省今年第一季度供应农具的数额超过去年第一季度两倍多；云南省供应的铁、木、竹农具比去年同期增加百分之一百二十，其中铁质农具增加二倍。
    各地供销合作社在经营小农具的工作中，一般都认真贯彻了“就地取材，就地制造，就地供应”的原则，重视了向当地手工业者委托加工和订货。云南省据八十五个县的统计，供销合作社已将铁匠炉一万一千六百多盘，木工、竹工九千四百多户组织在自己的周围；该省一般地区的手工业产品，百分之五十都是为合作社生产的。福建省闽侯、福安两个专区的供销合作社，即和二百五十八个铁匠炉及二百多个铁业生产小组、四十九个木器生产小组、八十八个竹器生产小组、四十四个棕衣生产小组订立了加工、订货合同。为了便利农民购买农具，不少基层合作社建立了农具专业门市部，许多合作社在农民赶集、赶庙会的时候摆摊供应，有些合作社还组织了流动下乡送货小组，召开了小型物资展览会或小型物资交流会。山东省泰安专区的基层合作社共设立小农具门市部一百零六个，在集市摆设货摊一百三十二个；另外，据该专区八个县的统计，下乡送货小组即有二十五个。云南省玉溪县第五区供销合作社，通过物资交流会供应的水车、锄头等农具有一千多件，价值六千一百多万元。
    由于农业生产互助合作运动的开展，今年各地供销合作社供应新式农具的数量更加增多。山东省各地供销合作社已供应新式步犁八千九百多部、水车一千二百多部；其中大部分是互助合作组织购买的。山西省运城专区供销合作社通过结合合同，供应给农业生产合作社和互助组的新式步犁、水车等，已有二百二十多部。许多地区的供销合作社在供应新式农具的时候，和农业部门一起进行了传授技术的工作。山西省解县供销合作社配合农业部门组织了三个技术小组，下乡为农民检修新式农具，同时还新供应了八十多部新式步犁及五百多斤农药。山东省文登、聊城、菏泽、济宁等专区的供销合作社和农业部门，今春对已经供应到农民手中的新式农具普遍进行了一次检查和修理；聊城专区各县还普遍建立了农具修配站，只清平县目前就已建立了十六处。由于供销合作社和农业部门大力传授技术，仅山东省菏泽专区即有大约十一万人初步掌握了新式农具的使用方法。（昭济）
