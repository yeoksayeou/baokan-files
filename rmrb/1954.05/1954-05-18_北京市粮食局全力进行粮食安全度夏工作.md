The Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau is vigorously carrying out work to ensure grain safety during the summer, and the grain drying work has basically been completed.

This year, the quantity of grain stored in Beijing is large and the moisture content is high, making the storage work very heavy. As early as the beginning of January, all warehouses under the Municipal Grain Bureau conducted a comprehensive inspection and systematically carried out airing, drying, and ventilation work based on the moisture content of the grain. Up to now, the airing, drying, and ventilation work for grain with a moisture content of more than 15% has been basically completed. In terms of pest control, all warehouses have done a lot of work under the policy of "prevention is more important than cure." As of the end of April, the warehouse keepers had swept, brushed, picked, scraped, and disinfected the walls of 32 warehouses with lime water. Most of the open-air warehouse cargo spaces were cleaned and sprayed with 666 powder. Most of the mats, straw mats, sleepers, and sacks used for storing grain were fumigated and disinfected to eliminate pests.

Since May, the warehouses of the Municipal Grain Bureau have launched a grain protection work competition to ensure that the grain can safely survive the summer. Currently, the keepers are adding straw mats to the cargo spaces where grain is stored in the open air or replacing them with new mats to prevent rainwater from entering; dredging and repairing the ditches beside the cargo spaces to drain rainwater. The grain that has been aired and dried is being "cold-stored and sealed" (sealing the grain in piles) so that the grain is not affected by the external temperature. Ventilation and sorting are being carried out for some rice and flour. In addition, impurities are removed from the grain to ensure normal grain temperature; frequent and periodic tests are carried out on grain that is prone to heat and grain that has been stored for a long time to promptly understand the moisture and temperature of the stored grain in order to facilitate treatment. In pest control work, the main focus is on disinfection of empty warehouses before grain is put into storage, strengthening cleaning and sanitation work, and frequent inspection and timely treatment to eliminate overwintering grain insects.

    北京市粮食局全力进行粮食安全度夏工作
    北京市人民政府粮食局正大力开展粮食安全度夏工作，现晒粮工作已基本结束。
    今年北京市储存粮食的数量多、水份大，保管工作很繁重。早在一月初，市粮食局所属各仓库就普遍进行了检查，根据粮食水份的大小，有步骤地进行了晾、晒和出风工作。到目前为止，对水份在百分之十五以上的粮食，已基本上完成晾、晒和出风工作。在防虫工作方面，各仓库在贯彻“防重于治”的方针下，做了不少工作。到四月底为止，各仓库保管人员已把三十二幢仓房的墙壁进行扫、刷、掏、刮和用石灰水消毒。大部分露天仓的货位底下进行了打扫，并喷射了六六六药粉。把大部分保管粮食用的席子、茓子、枕木、麻袋等进行薰蒸、消毒，以消除虫害。
    五月份以来，市粮食局各仓库展开了护粮工作竞赛运动，使粮食能够安全度夏。现保管人员对露天存放的粮食在货位上加苫席子或改用新席苫盖，以防雨水侵入；疏通和整修货位旁的水沟，以排除雨水。对已晾、晒过的粮食进行“冷存密封”（把粮食作囤密封），使粮食不至因外温而受到影响。对部分大米、面粉进行出风、整理。此外，还去除粮食中的杂质，以保证粮温正常；对容易发热的和长期保管的粮食，作经常和周期性的化验工作，及时了解存粮的水份和温度，以便于处理。在防虫工作上，主要是注意入仓前进行空仓消毒，加强清洁卫生工作，经常检查及时处理，消灭越冬仓虫。
