    Some Suggestions for Improving Bookbinding Design Work
    Reader Chen Yue writes: I have several opinions on the current bookbinding design work, and I am now putting them forward for the reference of publishing houses.
    1.  The thickness of the paper used for book covers should be determined according to the number of pages, the target audience, or the specific purpose. For example, the purchasers of comic books are generally libraries, cultural centers, or book rental stalls; very few are individual purchases. However, the cover paper of many comic books is currently thin and brittle. After the purchasing units buy them, they have to add kraft paper covers to the new books. This not only makes it inconvenient for the purchasers but also weakens the due effect of the cover painting.
    2.  Many publishing houses like to use white paper as the cover and then add full-page colors, text, and pictures to the cover, even the back cover. This adds an extra process of plate making and printing costs, and the effect is not necessarily good. Efforts should be made to improve this in the future.
    3.  The artistic design of the covers and title pages of many books is too simple, and the font used is always the Song typeface in art fonts. Someone once suggested that the font used on book covers should be clean, generous, not archaic, not cursive, and not strange, and that the remains of ancient Chinese calligraphers should be appropriately used. This is worth considering and adopting by publishing houses. Translated books should use the original cover art design as much as possible. This maintains the original style and saves trouble.
    4.  Currently, it seems that only hardcover books use thread stitching. Generally, paperback books always use wire staples, three-hole staples, sewing staples, and other binding methods. For example, the 25-open paperback editions of “Selected Works of Mao Zedong” and “Collected Works of Stalin” are all bound with three-hole staples. This binding method is not right from the perspective of serving readers or saving paper. Although the binding cost of thread stitching is higher than that of paperback staples, it can expand the page area, improve paper utilization, and reduce book costs. If publishing houses adopt the method of thread stitching, they will definitely be welcomed by readers.
    5.  Currently, the covers of general paperback books rarely use folding edges, but some publishing houses cut off the extra paper edges of the cover paper and sell them by the kilogram as waste. Using folding edges for book covers can thicken the cover and avoid and reduce curling and cornering. This does not have a big impact on the cost of the book, and the paper edges folded inside the book can also be used to print content summaries or introduce relevant reference books.

### 对改进书籍装帧设计工作的几点建议

专栏：读者来信摘要

    对改进书籍装帧设计工作的几点建议
    读者陈越来信：我对目前书籍的装帧设计工作有几点意见，现在提出来供出版机关参考。
    一、书籍封面用纸的厚度，应该按页数多少或读者对象、专门用途来决定。如连环画的购买者一般都是图书馆、文化馆或租书摊；个人购买的很少。但是目前不少连环画的封面用纸既薄且脆，对方买回去后，要在新书上加添牛皮纸的封面，这样不但使购买者感到不方便，而且也使封面画削弱了应有的作用。
      二、不少出版社喜欢用白纸作封面，然后再在封面上、甚至连封底在内，再加印上满版颜色以及文字、图画。这样既多一重制版、印刷费用，效果也不见得好。今后应当设法改进。
      三、不少书籍的封面、扉页的美术设计太简陋了，用字老是宋体的美术字。曾经有人建议书籍封面所用字体以干净大方、不古僻、不草、不怪为标准，适当地采用我国古代书法家的遗墨，这值得出版机关考虑采纳。翻译书籍可以尽量采用原著的封面美术设计，这样既保持原著风格，又省事。
    四、目前似乎只有精装书才用穿线钉，一般平装书老是用铁丝钉、三眼钉、缝纫钉等装订法，如
  “毛泽东选集”、“斯大林全集”二十五开平装本都是用三眼钉装订的。这种装订法，从服务读者或节约纸张等角度看，都不对头。穿线钉虽然装订费用比平装钉高，但是可以扩大版口面积，提高纸张利用率，降低书籍成本。出版机关如果采用穿线钉的办法，是一定会受到读者欢迎的。
    五、目前一般平装书的封面很少用折边方式的，而某些出版社却把封面纸多余的纸边裁下来当废料论斤出售。书籍封面采用折边的方式，可以使封面加厚，避免和减少卷边和卷角的现象。这样做对书籍成本的影响并不大，而折在书内的纸边还可以利用来印内容提要或介绍有关的参考书。
