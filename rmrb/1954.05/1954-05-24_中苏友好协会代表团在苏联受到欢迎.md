    The Delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Welcomed in the Soviet Union
   [Moscow Dispatch] Reporter Li He reports: Every day of the delegation from the General Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's visit to the Soviet Union is lived in an atmosphere of the warmest friendship.

    After participating in the May Day parade in Moscow and making preliminary visits, the delegation left Moscow on the 4th for the Azerbaijan Republic. They visited Baku for five days, then passed through Rostov, took the Lenin Volga-Don Canal to the hero city of Stalingrad, and then returned to Moscow.

    On the journey and in the cities where they stayed, the delegation received a warm welcome from the Soviet people. From Rostov to Stalingrad, almost every stop was crowded with people waiting for the arrival of the Chinese people's representatives, and they presented countless blooming lilacs and lilies of the valley to the representatives. Collective farm members from the Don River area of the Nikolayev district drove trucks to the dock dozens of miles away to welcome them, embracing the representatives for a long time. After the ship set sail, they followed the ship in trucks, hosts and guests cheering and waving to each other, reluctant to part until they were more than ten miles away.

      The delegation made extensive and close contact with workers, scientists, cultural and educational workers, students, and other citizens in Baku, Rostov, Stalingrad, and other cities. Offshore oil workers in Baku, construction workers in Rostov, and workers at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory all earnestly asked the delegation to send their greetings to the Chinese people. The famous Azerbaijani poet Urgun, the famous singer Bebtov who had visited China, and other famous social activists and cultural and educational workers accompanied the Chinese delegation to participate in many Sino-Soviet friendship activities in Baku.

    According to the original plan, the delegation successively introduced the construction of new China in politics, economy, culture, and education to the Soviet people. They gave four reports in Baku and also participated in the Soviet-Chinese art evening hosted by the Azerbaijan Republic's Foreign Cultural Association, where singers and actors from the delegation performed. In Rostov, the delegation also introduced the situation of young people and women in New China to local workers. The Soviet people everywhere expressed great concern about this. In particular, when the combat hero Wei Xiaotang introduced his heroic deeds, the Soviet people and the Soviet army expressed their greatest friendship for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Army with extraordinary enthusiasm. Comrade Wei Xiaotang was repeatedly lifted up and cheered by excited people.

    After returning to Moscow, the delegation will continue to visit and give more than ten reports on the construction of New China in various fields. Singers and actors from the delegation will also participate in performances.

    中苏友好协会代表团在苏联受到欢迎
   【本报莫斯科专电】记者李何报道：中苏友好协会总会赴苏代表团在苏联的每一天，都生活在最热烈的友好气氛中。
    代表团在莫斯科参加了“五一”节观礼并作初步参观、访问后，于四日离开莫斯科前往阿塞拜疆共和国。他们在巴库访问了五天，然后经过罗斯多夫，取道列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河，到斯大林格勒英雄城，再回到莫斯科。
    在旅途上和勾留的城市中，代表团都受到苏联人民的热烈欢迎。从罗斯多夫到斯大林格勒，几乎每一个停船站都拥塞着人群，等候中国人民代表的到来，他们把数不清的盛开的丁香花和铃兰花献给代表们。尼古拉也夫区顿河沿岸的集体农庄庄员们乘着卡车到数十里外的码头上来欢迎，他们和代表们久久拥抱。轮船启碇以后，他们又乘着卡车跟着轮船前进，主人和客人们相互欢呼招手，直到十数里外才恋恋不舍地离别。
      代表团广泛地和巴库、罗斯多夫、斯大林格勒等城市的工人、科学家、文教工作者、学生及其他市民作了热烈亲密的接触。巴库的海上采油工人、罗斯多夫城的建筑工人和斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂的工人们，都殷勤嘱托代表团向中国人民问好。阿塞拜疆著名诗人乌尔贡，曾来中国的著名歌唱家贝布托夫以及其他著名社会活动家与文教工作者，陪同中国代表团参加了巴库的许多中苏友谊活动。
    代表团根据原订计划，陆续向苏联人民介绍了新中国政治、经济、文化、教育各方面建设的情况。他们在巴库作了四次报告，还参加了阿塞拜疆共和国对外文化协会主办的苏中文艺晚会，代表团中的歌唱家和演员们在晚会上作了表演。在罗斯多夫，代表团也向当地工人介绍了新中国青年和妇女的情况。各地苏联人民都对这表示十分关切。特别是战斗英雄卫小堂同志介绍自己的英雄事迹时，苏联人民和苏联军队都异常热烈地表示了他们对于中国人民和中国人民军队的最伟大的友谊。卫小堂同志无数次被激动的人们抱了起来欢呼。
    代表团回到莫斯科后，除继续参观、访问外，将作十数次关于新中国各项建设情况的报告，代表团中的歌唱家与演员并将参加表演。
