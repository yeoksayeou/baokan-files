Implement "Three Checks and One Guarantee"

    After Anyang County, Henan Province, basically completed its cotton field sowing task this year, some cotton fields experienced seedling shortages. In response to this situation, the county leadership convened a meeting of district chiefs and district party secretaries, criticized complacency and paralysis, and deployed "Three Checks and One Guarantee" work focusing on checking seedling emergence, checking soil moisture, checking germination, and ensuring full seedling stands. Through the mobilization of various meetings at the district and township levels, the complacent and paralyzed mood began to change, and a mass upsurge of seedling inspection and replanting was initiated. Guo Zhaoxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wanzhang Village, Second District, had some members who feared that replanting would take too much work time and reduce grain distribution in the fall. After concrete accounting, the members generally realized that more work would result in more grain, and put forward the slogan "Check and replant as you go, leave no gaps, replant more where there are more gaps, replant less where there are fewer gaps, and ensure full seedling stands." On May 3rd, they replanted 20 mu in one day,带动 (motivating) two mutual aid groups to replant 10 mu in one day. The entire village completed the replanting task within four days. After inspection, Xigou Village in the Fifth District, the next day seven mutual aid groups took action to carry out replanting. Currently, this work is being carried out throughout the county.

Lü Hongbin Cooperative Leads the Whole Township in Seedling Replenishment

    Based on past experience in increasing production, Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, listed ensuring full and strong seedlings as one of the important keys to increasing production when formulating its annual production increase plan. When corn and sorghum emerged, the cooperative organized specialists to go to the fields to conduct inspections. The inspection results showed that there was a general shortage of corn seedlings. They introduced the inspection situation at the members' meeting and calculated the loss of production due to seedling shortage, making everyone realize the importance of full and strong seedlings. At the same time, they also specifically studied the methods of seedling inspection and replanting. After the meeting, the members took active action. Within two days, all 9,900 missing seedlings in the cooperative's 249 mu of corn were replenished.

    Under the leadership of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative, all six agricultural production cooperatives, 45 mutual aid groups, and six individual farmers in the township also successively invested in seedling inspection and replanting. Within a few days, the township replanted 550 mu of corn seedlings, with more than 20,900 seedlings replanted.

Guarantee Every Household Has Enough Seedlings

    Due to the heavy rains in the past half month, 48 households in Wulian Township, Pingjiang, Hunan Province, had rotten seedlings, with a total loss of about 700 jin of rice seeds. These households with rotten seedlings were mostly individual farmers with low skills and poor management of seedling fields. The 35 mutual aid groups in the township, on the other hand, had established seedling protection groups and selected special personnel to take care of the seedlings, achieving shallow irrigation and frequent drainage, and timely topdressing. The seedlings not only did not rot, but grew green and strong. In order to ensure that the households with rotten seedlings could replenish their seedlings in time, the township cadres convened a meeting of mutual aid group leaders and old farmers to study ways to solve the shortage of seedlings. The study resulted in the adjustment through mutual aid groups, solving the seedling problem for more than 54 mu of land; and finding relatives and friends to help solve the seedling problem for 34 mu of land. At the same time, the rotten seedling households were educated to process fertilizer themselves to cultivate seedlings. Now the whole township has solved the seedling shortage difficulty for 102 mu of land. Each rotten seedling household is now actively preparing for rice transplanting to ensure that every household has enough seedlings.

Changed the View That "It's Always Been Like This"

    Taiping Township, Yishan County, Guangxi Province, has more than 22,000 mu of land, which is generally planted with corn. Now the corn seedlings are generally three or four inches high. However, due to the lack of strict seed selection and the damage caused by birds and insects, the phenomenon of seedling shortage is very serious. Huang Xianhui, a member of the mutual aid group, had 247 missing seedlings on his 1.2 mu of corn. However, the masses believe that this large-scale seedling shortage is "always like this" and do not care about it. In order to break this idea of the masses, the work team stationed in the township, with the Huangma Agricultural Production Cooperative as the core, convened meetings of representatives of each village and mutual aid groups to explain the benefits of seedling protection and replanting to the masses. Only then did the masses realize that if they did not replant seedlings, a group would harvest 900 jin less, and the whole township would reduce production by tens of thousands of jin. Therefore, the next day at dawn, the Mao Shiming Mutual Aid Group had eight members go to the fields and transplanted 2,800 corn seedlings on 12 mu in one day, which can guarantee the production of 390 jin of corn. In the evening, the work team broadcast this news to the masses of each village. On the third day, Su Yuyou, Wei Ruie and other mutual aid groups also went out. Taiping Township set off a mass upsurge of replanting seedlings, protecting seedlings, fighting disasters, and increasing production. According to the statistics of ten mutual aid groups and four individual households in five villages in the first two days, a total of 52 people were dispatched, transplanting 3,879 seedlings and replanting 45 jin of seeds. The transplanted and replanted corn happened to catch up with two days of overcast rain, and now they are growing very well.

Help Potatoes Germinate in Time

    After leading the masses to plant more than 70 mu of potatoes, the People's Government of Jilunzhai Township, Woyang County, Anhui Province, launched a comprehensive movement to check planting, check growth, and check pests throughout the township in units of mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. The growth of potatoes is generally good, but some, due to lack of planting experience, were planted too shallow, dried up by wind and sun, and failed to germinate. A few fields also suffered from insect pests.

    In response to this situation, the township leadership promptly mobilized the masses to check while urging germination, replanting seedlings, transplanting seedlings, hilling up soil, and catching insects. All 14 agricultural production cooperatives and six mutual aid groups in the township invested in this work. In order to do a good job in field management, the township also established six technical training stations, each station organizing inspection teams of three to four people to conduct roving inspections. After the rain, the Ji Laozhuang inspection team found that 3.5 mu of potatoes were compacted by the rain, and the potato buds were stuck in the soil and could not emerge. The director of the Ji Laozhuang cooperative immediately mobilized seven people to go to the field to remove the "soil tiles" so that the potato seedlings could emerge in time.

Extinguish Peanut Pests

    Houda Township, Hui'an County, Fujian Province, planted more than 1,700 mu of peanuts this year. Due to the drought and severe insect pests this spring, the peanuts were generally damaged after sowing. More than 20% of the peanut seeds in the whole township did not germinate, and some were even more severely damaged; Chen Haitang, a member of the mutual aid group, planted 3.5 li of peanuts and used 6 jin of seeds, of which 5 jin were eaten by insects and did not germinate. The inability of peanuts to achieve a full stand has become a serious obstacle to increasing peanut production in the whole township. After discovering these situations, the township party branch immediately conducted research and mobilized the masses to do a good job in protecting peanut seedlings and ensuring a full stand. Within three days, the insect pests were basically extinguished, and more than 6,690 jin of peanut seeds were replanted in the whole township, ensuring a full stand. Replanting these seeds is equivalent to planting 340 mu of peanuts. If the yield per mu is calculated at 150 jin, 51,000 jin of peanuts can be harvested more.

Full and Strong Seedlings Are Key to Increasing Production

    The 24 mu of sorghum planted by the Yixin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Maguantun Village, Liaocheng County, Shandong Province, were short of about 500 to 600 seedlings per mu due to dry land. After the cooperative's management committee discovered this situation, it immediately convened a meeting of all production team members to discuss the issue of seedling protection. At the meeting, everyone calculated an account: if a sorghum ear yields 1.3 liang of grain, 545 seedlings missing per mu would result in a yield reduction of 44 jin, and 24 mu of sorghum in the whole cooperative would result in a yield reduction of more than 1,000 jin. After this calculation, everyone realized that ensuring full and strong seedlings is an important key to striving for a bumper harvest. Therefore, the members soaked sorghum seeds that night, and the next day they organized 14 male and female members to replant. They completed the replanting of 24 mu of sorghum in one and a half days. And also prepared for the seedling inspection and replanting of millet and cotton.

Replant When Seedlings Are Missing, Don't Wait and See

    Wang Baozhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shicun, Renqiu County, Hebei planted 75 mu of cotton this year. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, Wang Baozhang, the director of the cooperative, and several members went to the field to inspect it every two or three days. After the seedlings emerged, they found that 45 mu of cotton fields were seriously short of seedlings, so they immediately convened a meeting of members to mobilize everyone to replant seedlings. However, after hearing about the seedling shortage, some members wanted to destroy the cotton fields and replant them. Some advocated changing to plant millet and sorghum. After repeated mobilization by Wang Baozhang and Ding Jinyuan, explaining the importance of planting cotton according to the national plan, the members realized that they should replant seedlings, so they actively selected good cotton seeds for replanting. More than 60 male and female laborers in the whole cooperative replenished the 45 mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings within two days. They also replanted 9 mu of missing yams. And promoted the Xinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative to replenish 30 mu of cotton fields. Under the influence of the agricultural cooperative, the masses in the whole village actively carried out seedling inspection and replanting to ensure a bumper harvest.

    抓紧查苗补苗保证农业增产
    实行“三查一保”
    河南省安阳县今年棉田播种任务基本完成后，有些棉田发生缺苗现象。根据这种情况，该县领导上，召开了区长和区委书记会议，批判了松懈麻痹思想，布置开展以查出苗、查墒情、查发芽，保证全苗为内容的“三查一保”工作。经过区乡间各种会议的动员，开始扭转了麻痹松懈情绪，掀起了群众性的查苗补种热潮。二区湾漳村郭兆祥农业生产合作社有的社员怕补种误工太多，秋后分粮少，经过具体算账，社员普遍认识到多用工多得粮，提出了“随查随补，一块不留，缺多补多，缺少补少，保证全苗”的口号，五月三日一天就补种了二十亩，带动两个互助组一天补种十亩，全村在四天内就完成了补种任务。五区西沟村检查后，第二天即有七个互助组行动起来，进行补种。目前，这一工作正在全县范围内展开。
    吕鸿宾社带动全乡补苗
    山东省莒县吕鸿宾农业生产合作社根据以往增产经验，在订全年增产计划时，就把保证苗全苗旺列为增产的重要关键之一。玉米、高粱出土的时候，社内便组织专人分头到地里进行检查。检查结果，发现玉米普遍缺苗。他们将检查情况在社员大会上作了介绍，并算了缺苗减产账，使大家认识到苗全苗旺的重要。同时又具体研究了查苗补苗的办法。会后，社员们便积极行动起来。在两天之内，全社二百四十九亩玉米所缺的九千九百多棵苗全部补齐。
    在吕鸿宾农业生产合作社的带动下，全乡六个农业生产合作社，四十五个互助组和六户单干农户，也先后投入查苗补苗。几天之内，全乡就补种玉米苗五百五十亩，补苗达两万零九百多棵。
    保证户户秧苗齐全
    湖南省平江武莲乡因为最近半月来下雨很多，全乡有四十八户烂了秧，共烂掉谷种七百斤左右。这些烂秧户大都是单干农民，技术不高，秧田管理不好。全乡三十五个互助组则因为建立了保苗小组，选出了专人看管秧苗，做到了浅灌勤排，及时追肥，秧苗不但没有发烂，反而长得又青又壮。为了保证烂秧户能及时补齐秧苗，该乡乡干部召集了全乡的互助组组长及老农会议，研究解决缺秧的办法。研究结果，通过互助组进行调剂，解决了五十四亩多田的秧苗；找亲友帮助解决了三十四亩田的秧苗。同时教育烂秧户，自己加工施肥来培育秧苗。现在全乡已解决了一百零二亩田的缺秧困难。各烂秧户现正积极准备插秧，保证做到户户秧苗齐全。
    改变了“历来如此”的看法
    广西省宜山县太平乡有土地两万二千多亩，普遍种植玉米。现在玉米苗一般都有三、四寸高。可是，由于选种不严格和遭受鸟害虫害，缺苗现象很严重，互助组组员黄现辉的一亩二分玉米就缺苗二百四十七株。而群众对这种大量缺苗的现象，认为
  “历来如此”，满不在乎。驻该乡工作组为了打破群众这种思想，以黄麻农业生产合作社为核心，通过召开各屯代表会和互助组会，向群众算细账、讲明保苗补苗的好处后，群众才认识到如不补苗，一个组少收九百斤，全乡就要减产好几万斤。因此，第二天天一亮，毛世明互助组即有八个组员下地，
  一天移补了十二亩共二千八百株玉米苗，可保产玉米三百九十斤。晚上工作组把这个消息向各屯群众广播后，第三天苏雨由、韦瑞娥等互助组也都出动了，太平乡掀起了群众性的补苗保苗抗灾增产热潮。据五个屯十个互助组和四个单干户头两天的统计，一共出动了五十二人，移苗三千八百七十九株，补种了种籽四十五斤。移植和补种的玉米，刚巧赶上了两天阴雨，现在都生长得很好。
    帮助马铃薯及时生芽
    安徽省涡阳县纪伦砦乡人民政府，在领导群众种植了七十多亩马铃薯以后，就在全乡以互助组、农业生产合作社为单位，全面开展了查种植、查生长、查虫害的运动。马铃薯的生长情况一般都很好，但也有的因缺乏种植经验，栽种过浅，经风吹日晒，干了墒土，没能生芽，还有少数田发生虫害。
    根据这个情况，乡领导上就及时发动群众，一边检查，一边催芽补苗、移苗、培土、捕虫。全乡十四个农业生产合作社和六个互助组全部投入这一工作。为了把田间管理工作做好，乡里并建立了六个技术传授站，每站组织三个至四个人的检查组巡回检查。纪老庄检查组，在雨后检查，发现有三亩半马铃薯，被暴雨把地打板了，薯芽窝在土里顶不出来，纪老庄社主任就立即动员七个人下地揭去了
  “土瓦”，使薯苗及时长了出来。
    扑灭花生害虫
    福建省惠安县厚埭乡今年种植花生一千七百多亩。由于今春天旱和虫害严重等等，花生播种后普遍受害，全乡没出芽的花生种子达二成以上，个别的受害更严重；互助组员陈海堂种了三分五厘花生，下了六斤种，被虫吃掉、没有出芽的就有五斤。花生不能全苗，已成为全乡花生增产的严重阻碍。该乡党支部发现这些情况后，立即进行研究，发动群众做好花生的保苗全苗工作，在三天内就基本扑灭了虫害，全乡补种了花生种子六千六百九十多斤，保证了全苗。补种这些种子，等于种植了三百四十亩花生，每亩产量如以一百五十斤计算，即可多收花生五万一千斤。
    苗全苗旺是增产关键
    山东省聊城县马官屯村一心农业生产合作社种的二十四亩高粱，因土地干旱，每亩约缺五、六百棵苗。该社社务委员会发现了这个情况后，立即召开了全社生产队员会议，讨论了保苗问题。会上大家算了一笔账：一个高粱穗以收一两三钱粮食计算，每亩缺苗五百四十五棵，就要减收四十四斤，全社二十四亩高粱，就要减收一千多斤。经这样一计算，大家认识到保证苗全苗旺是争取丰收的重要关键。于是当天晚上社员们就浸好了高粱种子，第二天就组织了十四个男女社员进行补种，一天半的时间就将二十四亩高粱补种完了。并且还做好谷子、棉花的查苗补苗的准备工作。
    缺苗就补不要观望
    河北任邱县史村王宝章农业生产合作社，今年种了七十五亩棉花。为了保证获得丰收，该社社长王宝章和几个社员，每隔两三天即到地里检查一次。出苗后，他们发现有四十五亩棉田缺苗很严重，便立即召开社员会议，动员大家补苗，但是有些社员听了缺苗的情况后，就想把棉田毁掉，重新另种；有的主张改种谷子、高粱。经过社长王宝章、丁进元反复动员，说明按国家计划种棉的重要后，社员们才认识到应当补苗，于是便积极地选择优良棉种补种。全社六十多个男女劳动力在两天之内就把缺苗的四十五亩棉田补齐了。还把九亩缺苗的山药也栽补齐了。并带动了新兴农业生产合作社也补齐了三十亩棉田。在农业社的影响下，全村群众都积极进行查苗补苗，保证丰收。
