In accordance with the general tasks of the nation during the transition period, the fundamental task of higher education institutions is to cultivate, in a planned and proportional manner, all types of specialized construction talents who serve socialist construction, are physically fit, love the motherland, possess a certain level of Marxist-Leninist ideological understanding, and master advanced science and technology. The college entrance examination for new students is the primary step in ensuring the execution of this task. This year, due to the significant imbalance between the enrollment tasks of colleges and universities in various administrative regions and the student sources in those regions, a unified national enrollment system under the unified planning and leadership of the central government will still be implemented to ensure the comprehensive completion of the enrollment plan. To further overcome the shortcomings in the unified enrollment work and enable colleges and universities to admit qualified new students, it is necessary to implement the organizational policy of unified central planning, regional organization and execution, and direct responsibility of each school for reviewing and admitting applicants to that school, to further utilize and leverage the strength and initiative of the regions and schools. At the same time, we must vigorously strengthen educational guidance for college entrance, establishing the idea that candidates should pursue higher education for the needs of the country's socialist construction. For this purpose, the following regulations are made:

    I. All national colleges and universities, except for individual schools approved by the Central Higher Education Ministry and the Central Education Ministry, must participate in the unified national enrollment system and are not allowed to enroll students independently.

    II. The national college and university enrollment plan for this year is tentatively set at 90,505 students, of which 33,865 are in engineering, accounting for 37.42 percent of the total enrollment; 24,975 are in teacher training, accounting for 27.6 percent; 9,200 are in medicine, accounting for 10.17 percent; 5,740 are in science, accounting for 6.34 percent; 3,300 are in agriculture, accounting for 3.64 percent; 960 are in forestry, accounting for 1.06 percent; 7,110 are in liberal arts, accounting for 7.86 percent; 1,970 are in finance and economics, accounting for 2.17 percent; 2,000 are in political science and law, accounting for 2.21 percent; 1,000 are in physical education, accounting for 1.1 percent; and 385 are in arts, accounting for 0.43 percent.

    III. Each major administrative region should establish a college enrollment committee, which will be led by the higher education bureau and education bureau of the respective administrative region and composed of the presidents and relevant departments of the colleges and universities in that region. The committee will be responsible for handling registration, examination, admission, distribution, and organization of arrival procedures in the region. Each college and university should include enrollment work as one of its important tasks. In addition to actively participating in the work of enrollment agencies at all levels, each college and university should, under the unified leadership of the major administrative region, directly be responsible for examining and admitting the new students applying to that school.

    Provinces and cities with examination districts should, under the leadership of the provincial and municipal education departments (bureaus), organize the colleges and universities and related departments in the province or city to establish a branch of the college enrollment committee, and under the leadership of the major administrative region's college enrollment committee, handle the enrollment work of the examination district in the province or city.

    When a college enrollment committee or a college sends personnel to other regions to participate in enrollment work, they must accept the leadership of the local enrollment committee.

    IV. The unified national college entrance examination will be held from July 15 to 18 (the application registration date will be separately stipulated by the major administrative region's enrollment committee). Examination districts will be set up in the following locations:

      North China Region (7 districts)
    Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang

      Northeast Region (10 districts)
    Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Liaoyang, Jinzhou, Qiqihar, Yanji, Siping, Dalian, Mudanjiang

      East China Region (18 districts)
    Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinan, Qingdao, Taizhou, Jinhua, Hefei, Wuhu, Anqing, Bengbu, Fuzhou, Zhangzhou

      Central South Region (26 districts)
    Wuhan, Xiangyang, Yichang, Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Changde, Yuanling, Guangzhou, Haikou, Meixian, Shantou, Zhanjiang, Guilin, Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Yulin, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Xinyang, Nanyang, Nanchang, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Shangrao

      Southwest Region (10 districts)
    Chongqing, Wanxian, Nanchong, Chengdu, Luzhou, Ya'an, Guiyang, Kunming, Dali, Neijiang

      Northwest Region (4 districts)
    Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Nanzheng

      Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (2 districts)
    Ulanhot, Hohhot

    V. Any individual who meets one of the following conditions may apply for the examination:

    (1) Current year graduates of senior high schools (including students in spring semester classes who have completed five semesters and are permitted to graduate early) and current year graduates of worker-peasant accelerated middle schools who hold graduation certificates.

    (2) Current year graduates of secondary vocational schools who have been approved for further studies by their original schools according to the quotas allocated by the Central Higher Education Ministry, the Central Education Ministry, and relevant departments, and who hold graduation certificates and letters of introduction from their schools.

    (3) Staff members of government agencies, enterprises, schools, organizations, etc., who have been approved for further studies, and personnel in the military who are permitted to transfer to civilian work, who have a senior high school education level and hold a letter of consent from their original work unit.

    (4) Returned overseas Chinese students who have a senior high school education level and hold a certificate from a domestic overseas Chinese affairs agency.

    (5) Hong Kong and Macao students who have a senior high school education level and hold a certificate from the Guangzhou "Guiding Committee for Hong Kong and Macao High School Graduates Returning to Guangzhou for Further Studies."

    (6) Non-employed and non-student social youth who have graduated from senior high school or have a confirmed self-taught senior high school education level, are under 27 years of age, and hold a senior high school graduation certificate (referring to those who have actually graduated from senior high school) and a letter of introduction from the people's government at or above the district level in their locality.

    In addition to submitting the various certificates listed above when applying for registration, all types of applicants must uniformly submit a "Candidate Registration Form," an "Application Form," and a "Health Examination Record Form."

    VI. Applicants should, during the prescribed period and in accordance with the "Health Examination Measures for National College Enrollment" issued by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Central Higher Education Ministry, and the Central Education Ministry, undergo a health examination at a designated hospital. The health examination should be an important condition for admitting new students.

    Current year graduates of senior high schools (including students in spring semester classes who have completed five semesters and are permitted to graduate early), graduates of worker-peasant accelerated middle schools, and graduates of secondary vocational schools who have been approved for further studies should, with their original schools as the unit, and under the leadership of the local health and education departments (bureaus), undergo health examinations at designated medical institutions in their locality or nearby areas during the last semester of graduation.

    Applicants of the types described in Article V (3), (4), (5), and (6) should register for a health examination with the local enrollment agency before the application registration date (the start and end dates of registration will be determined by the enrollment committee of each region), and then the local enrollment agency will arrange the order and conduct the examinations in batches. The health examination record forms will be compiled by the medical institutions and submitted to the local enrollment agency.

    VII. After newly admitted students have registered for enrollment, colleges and universities may conduct a health re-examination based on the actual situation; if the re-examination is not qualified, their admission qualifications will be revoked, and their student status will not be retained.

    VIII. To facilitate the enrollment work, applicants should apply for the examination only in the examination district located in their locality (i.e., the location of their graduating school, work unit, or permanent residence registration); applicants in localities without an examination district should apply in a nearby examination district. Hong Kong and Macao students should apply in Guangzhou.

    Current year graduates of senior high schools, worker-peasant accelerated middle schools, and secondary vocational schools who have been approved for further studies should adopt a collective application registration method, that is, the graduating schools should uniformly, within the dates stipulated by the major administrative region's enrollment committee, collect various forms from the local or nearby enrollment agency, guide the students to fill them out, and then submit them to the enrollment agency together with the health examination record forms and the required certificates. Other types of candidates should still adopt an individual application registration method.

    IX. Due to the imbalance between the enrollment plans of colleges and universities in various major regions and the sources of students, appropriate adjustments must be made between the regions. Applicants should follow the following principles when filling in their regional preferences.

    (1) The North China, Northeast, and Northwest regions have fewer student sources and are insufficient to meet the enrollment needs of the region. Except for the permission to apply for a few designated schools in other regions, students in the above regions should generally apply for schools in their own region.

    (2) The East China, Central South, and Southwest regions have more student sources, exceeding the enrollment plans of the region. Students in the above regions can apply for schools in the North China, Northeast, and Northwest regions.

    (3) Applicants in the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions generally cannot be transferred to each other, except for individual special circumstances and with the approval of the examination district where they are located.

    X. Application preferences should be based on departments, disciplines, and specialties, and applicants should select departments, disciplines, specialties, and schools realistically based on the needs of the country's comprehensive construction and in combination with their personal circumstances. The college enrollment committee of each region should conduct admission distribution according to national needs and with reference to the applicant's stated preferences to ensure the comprehensive completion of the enrollment task.

    XI. To meet the different requirements of each department and specialty for the academic performance of candidates, the examination subjects are divided into two major categories this year:

    (1) The examination subjects for science, engineering, health sciences, agriculture, forestry, and other related specialties are: Chinese Language, Political Knowledge, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Foreign Language.

    (2) The examination subjects for liberal arts, political science and law, finance and economics, physical education, arts, and other related specialties are: Chinese Language, Political Knowledge, History, Geography, and Foreign Language.

    Departments of music, fine arts, and drama should add a professional subject examination in addition to the above subjects.

    Note: (1) Applicants for higher normal schools should take the examination according to the examination subjects of liberal arts, science, physical education, and arts depending on the department they are applying for.

    (2) Applicants for the geography department in science should take the (1) category subjects and also take an additional geography examination.

    (3) Applicants for finance and economics specialties should take the (2) category subjects and also take an additional mathematics examination.

    XII. To enable applicants to systematically review and prepare for the examination in order to improve quality, the Central Higher Education Ministry and the Central Education Ministry will issue examination outlines for each subject for use.

    XIII. Graduates of worker-peasant accelerated middle schools, secondary vocational schools, and applicants who meet the conditions of Article V (3) are exempt from the foreign language examination.

    XIV. Current year graduates of worker-peasant accelerated middle schools and those who meet one of the following conditions should be given priority for admission when their examination scores reach the admission standard for the department and specialty they are applying for.

    (1) Industrial workers in factories, mines, farms, and other industrial sectors.

    (2) Cadres from worker-peasant families or who are themselves of worker-peasant origin.

    (3) Ethnic minority students and overseas Chinese students.

    Applicants who meet the above (1) and (2) conditions should submit a certificate from their original work unit regarding the above conditions. Ethnic minority students and overseas Chinese students should submit letters of introduction from relevant agencies and organizations.

    XV. Applicants must not forge any documents or falsely report their academic qualifications, experience, or engage in any acts of deception or concealment. Otherwise, once discovered, the applicant will be immediately disqualified from the examination, and students who have already been admitted will be expelled from their student status.

    XVI. After the results are announced, admitted new students should register at the school within the prescribed period, otherwise their admission qualification will be revoked. Candidates who are not admitted should solve their employment or learning problems on their own, and the enrollment agencies at all levels will not handle them.

    XVII. Specific measures for the unified enrollment will be formulated separately by the National College Enrollment Committee and the enrollment committees of the major administrative regions.
