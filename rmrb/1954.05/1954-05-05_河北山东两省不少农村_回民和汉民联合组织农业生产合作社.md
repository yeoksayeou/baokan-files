In Many Rural Areas of Hebei and Shandong Provinces
Hui and Han Peoples Jointly Organize Agricultural Production Cooperatives
In Hebei and Shandong provinces, there are approximately 600,000 Hui people scattered across the countryside. The majority of those living in rural areas reside in the same townships or villages as the Han people, fostering unity and mutual assistance to jointly develop production. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei Province, there are more than ten agricultural production cooperatives jointly organized by Han and Hui farmers. The Shi Chaozong Han-Hui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinbei Village, Jintan Town, Daming County, with its ninety-two households, is a model cooperative for the entire county. Since its establishment in 1952, the Party branch has consistently educated members on ethnic unity and mutual respect for customs and habits, fostering strong solidarity among the members. When Hui members had weaker farming skills, Han members patiently helped them learn various cultivation techniques. The three production teams are led by Han team leaders and Hui deputy team leaders. The cooperative has also established three oil presses based on the Hui members' expertise, with Hui members serving as managers. All members are closely united and actively engaged in production. Last year, the yields of various crops exceeded those of ordinary mutual aid teams and individual farmers. For example, cotton yields per mu exceeded those of individual farmers by 39 jin, peanut yields per mu exceeded those of individual farmers by 98 jin, and millet yields per mu exceeded those of individual farmers by 174 jin. Income from sideline production reached 172.2 million yuan. The increase in production has increased the actual income of the members. For example, Shi Hongling, a 62-year-old member who lives alone and was sick for two months, earned over one hundred workdays throughout the year and received 1,100 jin of grain, enough to eat and wear well, unlike in the past when he lacked food and clothing. Another example is the production team leader Zhang Yi, whose family of three laborers earned 11,775 jin of grain equivalent. This has greatly encouraged the members' confidence in developing agricultural production and changed the Hui members' old habit of not paying attention to agricultural production.

This year, many agricultural production cooperatives jointly organized by Han and Hui peoples have also emerged in Shandong Province. The Wang Desheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pozi Village, Yidu County, is an outstanding model cooperative in the county. It has fifteen member households, including four Han households and eleven Hui households. The cooperative's director, Wang Desheng, is Han, and the deputy director, Yang Rubiao, is Hui. Before liberation, all fifteen households were tenants of landlords, and fourteen of them owned no land at all. During the land reform, the fifteen households were allocated a total of 198 mu of land. To overcome production difficulties, they organized mutual aid teams in 1951 and established an agricultural production cooperative on this basis in 1952. Even in the mutual aid team stage, everyone paid great attention to ethnic unity, mutual assistance, and mutual respect for customs and habits, and they helped each other in weddings, funerals, and other important events. Hui member Zhao Yuming helped Han member Jiao Huayu with plowing using his livestock and farm tools; when Hui member Ma Zhongji had financial difficulties, Han members Wang Desheng and Liu Zenglin lent him money and grain. After the establishment of the cooperative, all members regularly engaged in criticism and self-criticism at member meetings and production group meetings, further strengthening the unity between the Han and Hui peoples. In 1953, they achieved a bumper harvest, with an average wheat yield of 530 jin per mu, an average spring corn yield of 1,428 jin per mu, an average cotton yield of 500 jin per mu, and an average flue-cured tobacco yield of 800 jin per mu. The entire cooperative, with 77 people, received an average of 956 jin of grain per person, and the income from flue-cured tobacco and cotton, converted into money, averaged 910,000 yuan per person. The increase in income has greatly improved the members' lives; everyone made new clothes for the New Year. All male members of the cooperative attended winter school, all female members attended people's schools, and all school-age children attended primary school. Six young female members were able to recognize two to three thousand characters. Wang Desheng and Yang Rubiao, who had never attended school before, are now able to read letters and newspapers. This year, the cooperative also bought two mules, one cow, one horse, seven waterwheels, one Polish plow, one new-style weeder, and one sprayer.

    河北山东两省不少农村
    回民和汉民联合组织农业生产合作社
    河北、山东两省散居的回民约有六十多万人，居住在农村的回民大部分是和汉民杂居在一个乡或一个村内，他们和汉民团结互助、共同发展生产。据河北省不完全的统计，就有十几个汉、回两族农民共同组织的农业生产合作社。大名县金滩镇金北村九十二户的石朝宗汉、回民农业生产合作社，是全县的模范社。该社自一九五二年成立以来，党支部即经常注意对社员进行民族团结、互相尊重风俗习惯的教育，社员们都很团结。回民社员耕作技术差，汉民社员就耐心帮助他们学会各种耕作技术。三个生产队由汉民担任队长，回民担任副队长。社内并根据回民社员的专长，开办了三个榨油坊，经理都由回民社员担任。全体社员亲密团结，积极生产，去年各种作物产量都超过一般的互助组和单干户。如棉花每亩产量超过单干户三十九斤，花生每亩产量超过单干户九十八斤，谷每亩产量超过单干户一百七十四斤。副业生产收入一亿七千二百多万元。生产量的提高，增加了社员的实际收入。如社员石洪岭，六十二岁，独自一人，病了两个月，全年做了一百多个劳动日，分到粮食一千一百斤，过去缺吃少穿，今年吃穿都有余了。又如生产队长张仪，全家有三个劳动力入社，分粮折谷一万一千七百七十五斤。因此大大地鼓舞了社员发展农业生产的信心，改变了回民社员不重视农业生产的旧习惯。
    山东省今年也出现了不少的汉、回民联合组织的农业生产合作社，益都县坡子村王德声农业生产合作社是个全县出色的模范社，社员十五户，其中汉民四户，回民十一户，社主任王德声是汉民，副主任杨汝标是回民。十五户社员解放前都给地主当佃户，其中十四户寸土皆无。土地改革时十五户共分得土地一百九十八亩。为了克服生产上的困难，从一九五一年就组织了互助组，一九五二年又在这个基础上成立了农业生产合作社。还在互助组时，大家就很注意民族团结，互相帮助，互相尊重风俗习惯，遇有婚、丧大事，也都互相帮助。回民赵玉明有牲口农具，就帮助汉民焦化玉耕种；回民马中记生活有困难，汉民王德声、刘增林就借钱借粮给他。成立合作社后，全社社员在社员大会和生产小组会上经常进行批评和自我批评，汉、回民之间的团结更加密切。一九五三年获得大丰收，小麦每亩平均产量五百三十斤，春玉米每亩平均产量一千四百二十八斤，棉花每亩平均产量五百斤，黄烟每亩平均产量八百斤。全社共有七十七口人，每人平均得粮食九百五十六斤，黄烟、棉花收入折钱每人平均得九十一万元。收入增加，使社员的生活得到了很大的改善；过年时人人都做了新衣服。全社男社员都上了冬学，女社员都上了民校，学龄儿童都上了小学，六个青年女社员都能识到二千至三千个字，王德声、杨汝标过去一天书没念过，现在也能看书信和报纸了。该社今年并买了骡两匹，牛、马各一头，水车七部，波兰排犁一部、新式耘锄一部，喷雾器一部。
