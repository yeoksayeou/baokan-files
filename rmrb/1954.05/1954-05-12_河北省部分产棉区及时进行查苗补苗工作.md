Some cotton-producing areas in Hebei Province, due to strong winds and little rain during the sowing season, insufficient technical guidance, and rough cultivation, have experienced incomplete emergence of seedlings in many cotton fields. Currently, various localities are leading farmers to promptly check and replenish seedlings. Party and government leading organs in Handan and Shijiazhuang prefectures, as well as in Cheng'an, Shahe, and other areas, have successively issued urgent instructions, organizing cadres to go to the countryside for inspection. For example, after Shahe County basically completed its cotton planting plan in late April, the Deputy Secretary of the CCP Shahe County Committee and five County Committee members went to various districts to inspect the seedling emergence situation. After discovering poor emergence, they immediately convened meetings of township and village cadres to launch a seedling check-up and replenishment competition. In addition to sending people to the countryside for in-depth inspections, Cheng'an County promptly allocated 800,000 jin of cotton seeds from the county's reserves to support farmers in replanting. The Liu Wanzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanhe County found that cotton seeds were easily dried by the wind and difficult to sprout after sowing. They first scraped off a layer of topsoil, then watered, and after the water seeped in, covered it with a layer of dry soil, and then hoed it over in one or two days, so that the cotton quickly sprouted. Farmers in the fifth district of Lixian County initially had very low morale. After in-depth mobilization, a competition to replenish and protect seedlings was launched. In five days, the entire district has replanted and re-sown 11,895 mu.

    河北省部分产棉区及时进行查苗补苗工作
    河北省部分产棉地区，由于播种季节风多雨少，技术指导不够，耕作粗放，以致不少棉田出苗不全，目前各地正领导农民及时进行查苗补苗。邯郸、石家庄专区和成安、沙河等不少地区的党政领导机关，都已先后发出紧急指示，组织干部下乡检查。如沙河县在四月下旬全县植棉计划基本完成后，中共沙河县委副书记和五个县委委员，分赴各区检查了棉田出苗情况，发现出苗不好以后，立即分片召开乡、村干部会议，开展查苗补苗竞赛。成安县除派人下乡深入检查外，还及时把县里存的八十万斤棉籽调拨下去，支持农民补种。三河县刘万珍农业生产合作社，播种后棉籽被风吹干不易出苗，他们就先把表土扒开一层，然后浇水，水渗下去后盖上一层干土，过一、两天再用锄推一遍，使棉花很快出苗。蠡县五区农民起初情绪很低落，经过深入发动，开展起补苗保苗竞赛，在五天时间，全区已补种和重种一万一千八百九十五亩。
