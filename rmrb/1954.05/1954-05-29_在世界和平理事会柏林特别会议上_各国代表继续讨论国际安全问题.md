Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 28th: According to TASS Berlin: The World Peace Council Special Session in Berlin continued its discussion of the second item on the agenda on the morning of the 27th: International Security Issues.

    Thakin Lun, President of the All Burma Trade Union Congress, spoke. He said that the era when the oppressed people of Asia meekly endured the rule of their enslavers has passed. The united front of the Asian people fighting for their national freedom and world peace is growing stronger day by day. In this struggle, they are inspired by the example of the hundreds of millions of Chinese people who have already made great progress politically and economically.

    Thakin Lun said that the purpose of the warmongers in establishing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is to attempt to undermine peace in Asia and enslave the Asian people. Under these circumstances, Asian countries must work together and, on the basis of common agreements among them, seek ways to safeguard peace and security in Asia. Thakin Lun concluded by saying, "We hope and demand a complete ban on all weapons of mass destruction. We hope and demand that China be given its legitimate status in the United Nations. We demand an immediate cessation of the war in Indochina and measures to prevent the recurrence of military operations in Korea."

    Sven Hector, a representative of religious circles in Sweden, said that the Swedish people have long been deceived by the illusion that peace can be established automatically, but this situation has changed greatly. Representatives of various Swedish parties, official spokesmen, and prominent Swedish leaders are rising one after another to demand a ban on all weapons of mass destruction and to demand the maintenance of peace.

    Han Sorya, Chairman of the National Committee for the Defense of Peace of Korea and Chairman of the Korean Writers' Union, spoke. He emphasized that the people of Asian countries, including the people of Korea, who have defeated the American aggressors and achieved great victory, are fully determined to fight for their freedom and independence until final victory. Speaking on the issue of Korean reunification, Han Sorya said that the national reunification of Korea, which has been artificially divided, can only be restored by holding all-Korean elections and establishing a unified, democratic, all-Korean central government. However, the American aggressors have tried every possible means in the past to obstruct free elections in Korea. Today, they have put forward a proposal for so-called "free elections" under the supervision of the United Nations, attempting to obstruct the holding of genuinely free elections.

    Han Sorya concluded by saying, "We demand that the conspiracies of the traitor Syngman Rhee and their abettors to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean question be exposed and condemned. We demand a ban on weapons of mass destruction and the establishment of international institutions to supervise them. Therefore, we propose that this special session of the World Peace Council adopt corresponding letters to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, and at the same time launch a worldwide movement to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean question."

    Woillez-Allard (France) supported the proposals made by previous speakers on banning weapons of mass destruction in his speech.

    Gordon Schaffer, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, spoke about the struggle of the peace-loving forces in Britain and other countries against the conspiracy of the American rulers to incite another large-scale war in Asia. He said that our task is to strengthen the demands of the people of all countries for a policy of peace and friendship, and to isolate those who are preparing for war, making them powerless.

    Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Buddhist Association, emphasized in his speech that the proposals put forward by the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference reflected the peace policy of the Vietnamese people and government, were in line with the wishes of the people of Cambodia and Laos, and were in line with the interests of the French people and the principles of the world peace movement. He said, "We resolutely demand an immediate ceasefire throughout Indochina to create conditions conducive to negotiations. We propose that the World Peace Council call on all countries to oppose the schemes to undermine the Geneva Conference."

    Jorge Zalamea (Colombia), Secretary of the International Peace Prize and Gold Medal Judging Committee, announced at the meeting that the Judging Committee had awarded the 1953 International Peace Prize to British film artist Charlie Chaplin and Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich.

    Soviet poet Alexei Surkov said that the Soviet delegation believes that the World Peace Council will demand that the governments of the four major powers resume negotiations with the participation of representatives from East and West Germany in order to resolve the German issue by establishing an all-German government, withdrawing all occupation forces from Germany, and holding free all-German elections. He said that the Soviet delegation believes that this meeting of the World Peace Council will demand that the collective security of the world's major regions, especially Europe and Asia, be guaranteed, and that collective security organizations be established in accordance with the United Nations Charter in which all countries in these regions—regardless of their national and social systems—can participate.

    Also speaking at the meeting were: Krishnadeva Sethi, Member of the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir, Asad Simon, representative of Bolivia, Shuddhananda, Indian poet and religious leader, Professor J. C. Kumarappa of India, Bozorg Alavi, Iranian writer, Professor Göran von Bonsdorff of Finland, and Ahmed Muhammad Ali, member of the Iraqi Peace Committee.

    The morning session adjourned after a speech by Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University in China.

    在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上
    各国代表继续讨论国际安全问题
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界和平理事会柏林特别会议二十七日上午会议继续讨论第二项议程：国际安全问题。
    全缅工会大会主席德钦伦发言。他说，亚洲被压迫的人民温顺地忍受他们的奴役者的统治的时代已经过去了。为争取他们的民族自由和全世界和平而斗争的亚洲人民的统一阵线正在日益壮大。在这个斗争中，他们受到了已经在政治上和经济上有了巨大进展的数亿中国人民的范例的鼓舞。
    德钦伦说，战争贩子建立东南亚侵略集团的目的，是企图破坏亚洲的和平、奴役亚洲人民。在这种情况下，亚洲国家必须共同努力并在它们之间达成共同协议的基础上，谋求维护亚洲和平与安全的途径。德钦伦最后说，我们希望并要求完全禁止各种大规模毁灭性武器。我们希望并要求给予中国在联合国中的合法地位。我们要求立即停止印度支那战争，并采取措施防止朝鲜军事行动再起。
    瑞典宗教界代表斯温·赫克托发言说，瑞典人民长期来受到一种幻想的欺骗，认为和平能够自动地建立起来，然而目前这种情况已大大改变了。瑞典各党派代表、官方发言人和瑞典著名领袖正在纷纷起来要求禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器并要求维护和平。
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长、朝鲜作家同盟委员长韩雪野发言。他着重指出，亚洲各国人民，包括已打败美国侵略者，取得伟大胜利的朝鲜人民在内，有充分的决心为争取他们的自由和独立而斗争，直到取得最后胜利为止。韩雪野谈到朝鲜统一的问题时说，被人为地分开的朝鲜的国家统一，只有举行全朝鲜选举，成立一个统一、民主的全朝鲜中央政府才能恢复。但是美国侵略分子过去千方百计地阻挠在朝鲜举行自由选举。今天他们又提出了一个关于在联合国监督下举行所谓“自由选举”的建议，企图阻挠真正自由选举的举行。
    韩雪野最后说，我们要求揭露和斥责李承晚卖国贼和他们的教唆者企图阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的阴谋。我们要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器并建立国际机构来加以监督。因此，我们建议这次世界和平理事会特别会议通过相应的致日内瓦会议参加国的信件，同时发动一个世界范围的争取和平解决朝鲜问题的运动。
    渥伊勒—阿勒（法国）在发言中支持以前的发言者就禁止大规模毁灭性武器所提出的建议。
    英国和平委员会主席戈登·夏菲尔谈到了英国与其他国家的爱好和平力量，反对美国统治者想在亚洲煽动另一次大规模战争的阴谋的斗争。他说，我们的任务便是要加强各国人民对于和平与友谊政策的要求，是要孤立那些准备战争的人，使得他们无能为力。
    越南佛教协会会长黎廷探在发言中着重指出，越南民主共和国代表在日内瓦会议上提出的建议，反映了越南人民和政府的和平政策，是符合于高棉和寮国人民的愿望，符合于法国人民的利益和世界和平运动的原则的。他说，我们坚决要求在印度支那全境立即停火，以创造有利于谈判的条件。我们建议世界和平理事会号召一切国家反对破坏日内瓦会议的勾当。
    国际和平奖金与金质奖章评议委员会书记豪尔赫·萨拉麦亚（哥伦比亚）在会上宣布，评议委员会已把一九五三年的国际和平奖金授予英国的电影艺术家卓别麟和苏联的作曲家萧斯塔科维奇。
    苏联诗人阿列克谢·苏尔科克说，苏联代表团相信世界和平理事会将要求四大国政府恢复有东德和西德代表参加的谈判，以便通过建立一个全德政府、一切占领军自德国撤退和举行全德自由选举的办法来解决德国问题。他说，苏联代表团相信，这次世界和平理事会会议将要求世界上主要地区，首先是欧、亚两洲的集体安全得到保障，办法是根据联合国宪章建立这些地区的所有国家——不论其国家和社会制度——都能参加的集体安全组织。
    在会上发言的还有：克什米尔制宪议会议员克里希纳德夫·塞蒂、玻利维亚代表阿萨德·西蒙、印度诗人和宗教领袖舒德哈南达、印度傅·克·库马拉帕教授、伊朗作家博佐克·阿拉维、芬兰戈兰·邦斯多夫教授和伊拉克和平委员会委员艾哈德·穆罕默德·阿里。
    上午会议在中国北京大学校长马寅初发言后即告休会。
