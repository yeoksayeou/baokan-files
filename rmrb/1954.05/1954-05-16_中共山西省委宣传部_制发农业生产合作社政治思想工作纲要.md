The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
Issues Outline for Political and Ideological Work in Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    In order to establish a regular political and ideological work system for agricultural production cooperatives, the Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued the "Outline for Political and Ideological Work in Agricultural Production Cooperatives." The outline first points out that 73 percent of the province's townships have established 10,136 agricultural production cooperatives. The most important guarantee for consolidating and running these agricultural production cooperatives well is to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership over them. To achieve this task, Party committees at all levels and rural work cadres must, in connection with the actual work within agricultural production cooperatives and the actual thinking of the members in various regions, regularly conduct education on the Party's general line during the transition period, and on the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," as well as education on the cooperative's charter. In propaganda, typical examples should be used to educate the members. The focus should be on summarizing and commending advanced thinking, appropriately criticizing backward thinking, and using methods such as comparing good and bad to enlighten members' socialist consciousness. The members' congress, production team and production group meetings, and family meetings should be used as good forms for conducting political and ideological education for members. Political and ideological education should be conducted through irregular methods such as centralized classes, group discussions, and individual education. At the same time, each cooperative should be mobilized to widely establish reading groups and set up blackboard newspapers to fully utilize the role of key agricultural production cooperative radio stations. Villages with larger agricultural production cooperatives can promote "Patriotic Production Clubs" according to conditions, to meet the cultural needs of the masses and invigorate rural cultural and recreational life. Party branches in all townships throughout the province should exercise unified leadership and use all propaganda workers and propaganda tools in a unified manner. In propaganda, all localities should unify the leadership of internal and external propaganda, and prevent the phenomenon of disjunction between internal and external propaganda. Special attention should be paid to the political and ideological education of female members, and the tendency to neglect the education of female members should be constantly prevented.

    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the political and ideological work of agricultural production cooperatives, the outline finally stipulates: First, Party branches in villages that have established agricultural production cooperatives should first focus on doing a good job in the political and ideological work of agricultural production cooperatives to strengthen the political and ideological work of the entire village. Party branches in villages that have not yet established agricultural production cooperatives must concentrate their efforts on strengthening the political and ideological work of mutual aid teams, and promote the advancement of individual farmers by doing a good job in the political and ideological work of mutual aid teams; second, village branches should appropriately distribute Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists to various production teams and production groups of agricultural production cooperatives according to the size of the agricultural production cooperatives and the number of Party and Youth League members in various localities, but should avoid concentrating all Party and Youth League members in agricultural production cooperatives and relaxing leadership over mutual aid teams; third, Party committees at all levels must strengthen the education of Party branches, strictly enforce Party organizational life, and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, which is an important guarantee for doing a good job in agricultural production cooperatives and the entire political and ideological education work; fourth, propaganda departments of county and city Party committees should study the political and ideological situation of agricultural production cooperatives quarterly, and stipulate the specific content of political and ideological work of agricultural production cooperatives each quarter. The propaganda departments of the prefectural and provincial Party committees should hold two meetings on the political and ideological work of agricultural production cooperatives every year to summarize and exchange the experience of the political and ideological work of agricultural production cooperatives, in order to strengthen specific guidance on the political and ideological work of agricultural production cooperatives.

    中共山西省委宣传部
    制发农业生产合作社政治思想工作纲要
    为了建立农业生产合作社经常的政治思想工作制度，中共山西省委宣传部制发了“农业生产合作社政治思想工作纲要”。纲要首先指出全省百分之七十三的乡已建立起来一万零一百三十六个农业生产合作社。要巩固和办好这些农业生产合作社，最重要的保证是加强党对农业生产合作社的政治思想领导。为了实现这一任务，各级党委和农村工作干部必须联系各地农业生产合作社内的实际工作和社员的实际思想，经常进行党在国家过渡时期总路线的教育，和“中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议”和“中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”以及社章的教育。在宣传中要用典型事例教育社员。要以总结和表扬先进思想为主，适当地批评落后思想，和用好坏对比等方法，启发社员社会主义觉悟。要把社员大会、生产队和生产组会、家庭会作为对社员进行政治思想教育的好的形式。不定期地采用集中上课、分组讨论、个别教育的方法，进行政治思想教育。同时要发动各个社广泛建立读报组、设立黑板报充分发挥重点农业生产合作社收音站的作用。有较大农业生产合作社的村庄，可根据条件推行“爱国生产俱乐部”，以满足群众的文化需要和活跃农村文化娱乐生活。全省各乡党的支部要对全乡的宣传员和一切宣传工具统一领导和统一使用。各地在宣传时，要把社内宣传和社外宣传统一领导起来，防止社内宣传和社外宣传互相脱节的现象。特别要注意对妇女社员的政治思想教育，经常防止忽视对妇女社员进行教育的偏向。
    为了加强党对农业生产合作社政治思想工作的领导，纲要最后规定：一，凡是已建立了农业生产合作社的乡村党支部，首先应以做好农业生产合作社的政治思想工作为主，来加强整个乡村的政治思想工作。凡尚未建立农业生产合作社的乡村党支部，必须集中力量加强对互助组的政治思想工作，并通过做好互助组的政治思想工作，带动单干农民前进；二，乡村支部应按农业生产合作社的大小，和各地党、团员的数量适当地把党、团员和宣传员分布到农业生产合作社的各个生产队和生产组中去，但要避免把所有党、团员都集中到农业生产合作社，而放松对互助组的领导；三，各级党委都必须加强党支部的教育工作，严格党的组织生活，经常开展批评和自我批评，这是做好农业生产合作社和整个政治思想教育工作的重要保证；四，各县委、市委宣传部应按季研究农业生产合作社的政治思想情况，规定每季农业生产合作社政治思想工作的具体内容。地委、省委宣传部每年应召开两次有关农业生产合作社政治思想工作的会议，总结并交流农业生产合作社政治思想工作的经验，以加强对农业生产合作社政治思想工作的具体指导。　（鲁生）
