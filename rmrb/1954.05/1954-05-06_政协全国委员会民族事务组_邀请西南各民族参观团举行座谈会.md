Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: The Ethnic Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference invited Zhang Dengxiang (Han nationality), head of the Southwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation, deputy heads Jiang Daolun (Yi nationality), Peng Fatang (Tibetan nationality), and all members of the delegation to a symposium on May 4th.

At the meeting, Zhu Zaoguan, head of the Ethnic Affairs Group, spoke about the general tasks of the state on ethnic issues during the transition period and the steps for economic construction in minority areas. He pointed out that at present, minority areas should still focus on developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, and for the minority areas in the southwest, special emphasis should be placed on developing agricultural production. The Party and the People's Government will further help farmers of all ethnic groups improve their production tools, improve agricultural production technology, and build water conservancy projects to increase yields and improve the lives of farmers of all ethnic groups. As for the industrial construction of minority areas, it should be considered from the perspective of the overall construction of the country, relying on the strength of the state and unified plans and steps, as well as the distribution of resources and transportation in minority areas and other practical conditions, to carry it out step by step with emphasis. Finally, he hoped that after returning to their ethnic areas, the representatives would exert their strength, influence and drive the masses to develop production and construction with their exemplary actions, in order to improve the material and cultural life of all ethnic groups.

At the meeting, Jiang Daolun, deputy head of the visiting delegation and representative of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, Wang Shangxian, representative of the Buyi nationality of Guizhou Province, Dao Mingliang, representative of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, Yang Zhankui, representative of the Yi nationality of Leibo County, Sichuan Province, and Zaiwa Rangbu, representative of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, all spoke. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously expressed their gratitude to the People's Government for helping minority nationalities establish ethnic regional autonomous regimes, improve production methods, and develop mutual aid and cooperation movements, resulting in good results. Wang Shangxian, representative of the Buyi nationality of Guizhou Province, said in his speech: After liberation, we were allocated land and merged the small plots of land we were allocated into large plots, organized mutual aid teams, and developed from mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives. Our grain output in 1953 increased by 46 percent compared to 1952. Dao Mingliang, representative of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, said: Before liberation, half of the 36 households in our Longsa Village lacked food every year, but now only 3 households lack food; before liberation, there were only 7 horses in the whole village, but now there are 59 horses. This shows that under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the lives and production of our ethnic minorities are constantly improving. The representatives also expressed their intention to learn from the advanced experiences of the Han areas in developing production during this visit, and with the help of the Han people, actively develop the production and construction of ethnic areas, and transition to a socialist society together with all fraternal ethnic groups.

The Southwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation has a total of 43 members and accompanying staff, including Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Dai, Dong, Nong, Buyi, Hani (Aini), Lahu, Wa, Lisu, and Han nationalities. They arrived in Beijing on April 27, attended the "May 1st" celebrations in Beijing, and will visit various places.

    政协全国委员会民族事务组
    邀请西南各民族参观团举行座谈会
    【新华社四日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会民族事务组，在五月四日邀请西南各民族参观团团长张登祥（汉族）、副团长蒋道伦（彝族）、彭发堂（藏族）和全体团员举行座谈会。
    会上，民族事务组组长朱早观讲述了过渡时期国家在民族问题方面的总任务和少数民族地区经济建设的步骤。他指出：目前少数民族地区仍应着重发展农业和畜牧业生产，对于西南的少数民族地区来说，应该特别着重发展农业生产。党和人民政府将进一步帮助各族农民改进生产工具，提高农业生产技术，兴修水利，以提高产量。改善各族农民的生活。至于少数民族地区的工业建设，要从整个国家的建设着眼，依靠国家的力量和统一的计划、步骤，以及少数民族地区的资源分布、交通运输等各种实际情况，有重点地逐步进行。最后，他希望代表们回到民族地区以后，发挥力量，以自己的模范行动影响并带动广大群众发展生产建设，以求得各民族的物质生活和文化生活的提高。
    会上，参观团副团长、西康省凉山彝族自治区代表蒋道伦、贵州省布依族代表王尚贤、云南省西双版纳傣族自治区代表刀明亮、四川省雷波县彝族代表杨占奎、西康省藏族自治区代表载瓦让布等都讲了话。各位代表在讲话中一致感激人民政府帮助少数民族建立民族区域自治政权、改进生产方法、发展互助合作运动后所得到的良好效果。贵州省布依族代表王尚贤在讲话中说：解放后我们分到了土地，并把分到的小块田合并为大块田，组织了互助组，又由互助组发展到农业生产合作社，我们的粮食产量一九五三年比一九五二年提高了百分之四十六。云南省西双版纳傣族自治区代表刀明亮说：解放前我们泷洒村的三十六户人家中，有二分之一的人家每年都缺粮，现在只有三户人家缺粮；解放前全村只有七匹马，现在已有五十九匹马。这说明我们少数民族在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，我们的生活和生产正在不断改善和提高。各位代表并表示在这次参观中要努力学习汉族地区发展生产的先进经验，在汉族人民的帮助下，积极发展民族地区的生产建设事业，和各兄弟民族一道过渡到社会主义社会。
    西南区各民族参观团共有团员和随团工作人员四十三人，包括藏、彝、苗、傣、侗、侬、布依、哈尼（爱尼）、拉祜、?颇、傈僳和汉等民族。他们在四月二十七日到达北京，在京参加了“五一”节观礼，并将到各地参观。
