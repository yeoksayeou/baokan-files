Xinhua News Agency, 12th: More than 6,000 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the afternoon of the 12th, warmly endorsing and supporting the position and propositions of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference.

    The conference was hosted by the China Peace Committee.

    Those present at the conference included Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman, and Standing Committee members Shao Lizi, Xu Deheng, and Luo Longji.

    World Peace Council members Ma Yinchu, Mao Dun, Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, Xiao San, Liu Guanyi, and Jin Zhonghua also attended the conference.

    Also present at the conference were Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Chen Kangbai, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, Nie Zhen, Chairman of the North China Branch of the China Peace Committee, Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the China Peace Committee, writer Lao She, and Wang Zizhong from the religious community.

    The conference hall was solemn and simple. A huge peace dove hung in the center of the rostrum, and flowers and plants were spread in front of the stage. Two large banners hung on both sides of the rostrum, reading: "Strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean question!" and "Strive for the restoration of peace in Indochina!"

    The conference began at 3:00 p.m. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, made an important report at the meeting. He said: Today, we, the people of all walks of life in the capital, are gathering here with excitement and good wishes to express our expectations for the Geneva Conference and hope that the Geneva Conference will achieve complete success.

    Guo Moruo said: This is the first time that the delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, has sat together with representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other relevant countries at this Geneva Conference to review and resolve the most pressing Asian issues. This fact means that the resolution of all major Asian and international issues must have the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China. The delegation of the People's Republic of China understands its important mission and participates in the Geneva Conference with sincerity and a spirit of consultation to promote the success of the conference. The Chinese people express their full support and endorsement for all the efforts made by our delegation and for the speeches made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai.

    Guo Moruo said: The Geneva Conference has been open for more than half a month. The conference has initially discussed the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and has begun to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina. Agreements have been reached on procedural matters for discussing the Korean question, and agreements have also been reached on procedural matters for discussing the Indochina question. These two agreements are a definite victory for the forces of peace in the early stages of the Geneva Conference.

    Guo Moruo said: On the first day of the meeting to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward positive proposals to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War and to completely and peacefully adjust the Korean question. At the meeting that began to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proposed inviting representatives of the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos to participate in the work of the conference. Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong also put forward eight important proposals on stopping hostile actions in Indochina and restoring peace in Indochina. The proposals of Foreign Minister Nam Il and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong fully express the will of the people of Korea and Vietnam, and also fully conform to the interests of the people of the world who demand peace. The Chinese people express their full support and full support for these two proposals.

    Guo Moruo said: However, the policy of the United States is taking a completely different path from that of people who love peace. People hope for a peaceful solution to the Korean question and hope for lasting peace in Korea, but the United States wants to maintain an unstable armistice in Korea, is unwilling to withdraw its troops, and is unwilling to see a peaceful and unified Korea. People hope to restore peace in Indochina so that the people of Indochina can enjoy their national rights, but the United States wants to maintain and expand its war of aggression here, enslaving and oppressing the people here. People hope for a new Asia and want Asians to handle their own affairs, but the United States is interfering and wants to establish a new colonial empire here. The people hope to hold a successful Geneva Conference to further ease international tensions, but the United States is doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Conference, and it wants to maintain and deepen international tensions. The U.S. policy of aggression and war must be stopped! The U.S. policy of obstructing and undermining the Geneva Conference must be stopped!

    Guo Moruo said: Our government delegation went to Geneva with a peaceful policy and with sincere peaceful wishes, and our people are determined to do everything in their power to support all the propositions of our delegation. These propositions not only fully conform to the interests of our people, but also fully conform to the interests of the people of all countries and world peace.

    Guo Moruo concluded: The Chinese people have ardent expectations for the Geneva Conference. We, together with the people of Asia and the people of the world, must strive for the success of the Geneva Conference.

    World Peace Council member Ma Yinchu then spoke. He said: The Chinese people are closely watching the progress of the Geneva Conference with full confidence and determination to defend world peace. The speeches made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference fully explained our country's peaceful foreign policy and our just propositions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and the restoration of peace in Indochina. These righteous, fair, and reasonable remarks have been fully supported by the people of the whole country and warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.

    World Peace Council member Mao Dun spoke. He said: We warmly endorse the speeches made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference. We also believe that the proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free elections throughout Korea should become the basis for a peaceful solution to the Korean question; on the Indochina question, the motion put forward by Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on inviting the Cambodian and Laotian resistance governments to participate in the Geneva Conference should be adopted, and national rights should be realized and peace restored through consultation. Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has already put forward eight proposals on the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference on the 10th, which provides a fair and reasonable basis for rebuilding peace in Indochina.

    Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, also spoke. She said: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech fully and correctly expressed the wishes of the people of the whole country and all women to safeguard peace in Asia and the world and to protect the safety and happiness of women and children. On behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and all Chinese women, I express my firm support and full support.

    Also speaking at the conference were Zhu Xuefan, Qian Sanqiang, Tian Demin, Chen Kangbai, Liang Xi, Lao She, Nie Zhen, Wu Han, and others. They unanimously expressed their warm endorsement and support for the just and reasonable propositions of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference. They also expressed their commitment to strive with practical actions to achieve good results at the Geneva Conference and to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    The meeting ended in warm applause.

    首都各界人民六千多人举行盛大集会
    支持中苏朝越四外长正义主张
    要求制止美国破坏日内瓦会议的政策
    【新华社十二日讯】首都各界人民六千多人十二日下午在中山公园音乐堂举行盛大集会，热烈拥护和支持我外长周恩来、苏联外长莫洛托夫、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日、越南民主共和国副总理兼代理外长范文同在日内瓦会议上的立场和主张。
    大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主持。
    出席大会的，有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席陈叔通，常务委员邵力子、许德珩、罗隆基。
    世界和平理事会理事马寅初、茅盾、章伯钧、蔡廷锴、萧三、刘贯一、金仲华等也出席了大会。
    出席大会的，还有中华全国总工会副主席朱学范，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全，中华全国民主青年联合会副主席钱三强，中华全国学生联合会主席田德民，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会副主席陈康白，中华全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会华北总分会主席聂真，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会北京市分会副主席吴晗，作家老舍和宗教界王梓仲等。
    大会会场庄严朴素。主席台中央高悬着巨幅和平鸽，台前布满花草。主席台两边悬挂的两幅大标语上写着：“为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗！”“为恢复印度支那和平而奋斗！”
    大会在下午三时开始。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在会上作了重要报告。他说：今天，我们首都各界人民，怀着兴奋的心情和善良的愿望在这里集会，来表示我们对日内瓦会议的期待，希望日内瓦会议获得圆满的成就。
    郭沫若说：在这次日内瓦会议上，以周恩来外长为首的中华人民共和国代表团，和苏联、美国、英国、法国及其他有关国家的代表们坐在一起，来审查和解决最迫切的亚洲问题，这还是第一次。这个事实意味着，所有重大的亚洲问题和国际问题的解决，必须有中华人民共和国的代表参加。中华人民共和国代表团理解到自己的重大使命，并抱着诚意和协商精神参加日内瓦会议，以促使会议得到成功。中国人民对于我国代表团所作的一切努力，对于周恩来外长的历次发言，都表示完全的支持和拥护。
    郭沫若说：日内瓦会议开幕以来已经有半个多月了。会议已经初步讨论了和平解决朝鲜问题，并已开始讨论恢复印度支那的和平问题。会议关于讨论朝鲜问题的程序事项获得了协议，关于讨论印度支那问题的程序事项，也达成了协议。这两个协议，是和平力量在日内瓦会议初期的肯定的胜利。
    郭沫若说：在讨论和平解决朝鲜问题会议的第一天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日，提出了防止朝鲜战争的重起和完全的和平调整朝鲜问题的积极建议。在开始讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的会上，越南民主共和国副总理兼代理外长范文同提出了邀请高棉和寮国抗战政府的代表参加会议工作的建议。范文同代理外长又在会上提出了停止印度支那敌对行动及恢复印度支那和平问题的八项重要建议。南日外务相和范文同代理外长的建议，完全表达了朝鲜和越南两国人民的意志，也完全符合世界人民要求和平的利益。中国人民对这两个建议表示完全拥护和全力支持。
    郭沫若说：但是，美国的政策却和爱好和平的人们走着完全不同的道路。人们希望和平解决朝鲜问题，希望在朝鲜得到持久的和平，但美国要在朝鲜保持不稳定的停战状态，不愿意撤退军队，不愿意看到和平和统一的朝鲜。人们希望恢复印度支那的和平，使印度支那人民享有自己的民族权利，但美国要在这里保持和扩大侵略战争，奴役和压迫这里的人民。人们希望一个新的亚洲，并让亚洲人自己处理自己的事务，但美国却来横加干涉，要在这里建立新的殖民帝国。人民希望开好日内瓦会议，使国际紧张局势得到进一步的缓和，但美国却千方百计地阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议，它要保持和加深国际紧张局势。必须制止美国的侵略政策和战争政策！必须制止美国阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的政策！
    郭沫若说：我国政府代表团是本着和平政策并带着真诚的和平愿望前往日内瓦的，我国人民决尽全力支持我国代表团的一切主张。这些主张不仅完全符合我国人民的利益，而且也完全符合各国人民和世界和平的利益。
    郭沫若最后说：中国人民对日内瓦会议抱着热烈的期望。我们和亚洲人民、世界人民一道，要力争日内瓦会议得到成功。
    世界和平理事会理事马寅初接着讲话。他说：中国人民满怀着保卫世界和平的信心和决心密切注视日内瓦会议的进展。我国周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的历次发言，充分地阐明了我国的和平外交政策，及对和平解决朝鲜问题与恢复印度支那和平问题的正义主张。这些义正词严、公平合理的言论已经得到全国人民的完全支持，得到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。
    世界和平理事会理事茅盾讲话。他说：我们热烈拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的历次发言。我们也认为：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相提出的关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的方案，应该成为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础；在印度支那问题上，应该通过越南民主共和国范文同副总理兼代理外长提出的关于邀请高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府参加日内瓦会议的动议，用协商方式实现民族权利、恢复和平。越南民主共和国范文同副总理兼代理外长十日在日内瓦会议上已经提出关于恢复印度支那和平问题的八点建议，这给重建印度支那和平问题提供了公正合理的基础。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全也讲了话。她说：周恩来外长的发言，完全正确地表达了全国人民和全体妇女对维护亚洲和世界和平、保卫妇女和儿童的安全与幸福的意愿。我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会和全中国妇女，表示坚决拥护和全力支持。
    在大会上讲话的，还有朱学范、钱三强、田德民、陈康白、梁希、老舍、聂真、吴晗等人。他们一致表示热烈拥护和支持我国周恩来外长、苏联莫洛托夫外长、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相、越南民主共和国范文同代理外长在日内瓦会议上的正义和合理的主张。并表示将以实际行动为争取日内瓦会议获得良好结果，为保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗。
    会议在热烈的掌声中结束。
