    Southwest Music Association Drafts This Year's Work Plan

The Southwest Musicians Association held an enlarged committee meeting last month. Du Xinyuan, member of the Culture and Education Committee of the Southwest Administrative Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the meeting, calling on musicians to deeply study the Party's general line during the transition period, strengthen creative practice, and use socialist realism creative methods to reflect the great and rich reality of the struggle.

The meeting summarized the previous music work in the Southwest region, believing that a lot of achievements had been made in the past work. In terms of creation, excellent works such as "Singing of Erlang Mountain" were produced; more than 20 collections of materials related to national and folk music were sorted out and published; mass music activities were promoted through the publication of various song selections and the holding of short-term music training courses. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work, such as the small output of works, which cannot keep up with the needs of the masses, and there are also tendencies towards formalism and conceptualization; mass music activities are also limited to campaign-style situations and cannot be carried out regularly, and so on.

According to the spirit of this meeting, the Executive Committee of the Southwest Musicians Association recently formulated the work plan for 1954.

The plan first proposed that the Southwest region's musicians should actively engage in creation in accordance with the spirit of the general line. The specific methods are: to find out the creative forces in various places in the region; to require local member groups to recommend excellent musical works to the association on a quarterly basis; to cultivate songwriting talents among workers, peasants and soldiers through agency publications; to organize criticism activities through various social activities; to create conditions to prepare for the annual selection of outstanding musical works at the end of the year.

The Southwest Musicians Association also plans to organize its members to engage in music performances in a planned way this year; assist the music working groups of various provinces and cities in carrying out mass music activities. It is planned to regularly hold internal and public auditions, rehearsals, concerts, and recitals; and organize a small touring observation performance. The plan also requires the discovery and training of outstanding folk singers and instrumentalists through various activities of members in various places. At the same time, it is planned to organize members to systematically collect, sort out, study, etc., national and folk music and opera and folk art music.

In addition, members will be organized to discover problems from the practice of creation and performance, conduct forums and discussions, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Run the agency publication "Southwest Music" well. (Ao Xueqi)

    西南音协拟订今年工作计划
    西南音乐工作者协会上月召开了委员会扩大会议。西南行政委员会文教委员会委员、中共四川省委宣传部部长杜心源在会上作了报告，号召音乐工作者深入学习党在过渡时期总路线，加强创作实践，以社会主义现实主义的创作方法来体现伟大而丰富的现实斗争。
    会议总结了西南区以往的音乐工作，认为过去的工作是取得不少成绩的，创作方面产生了“歌唱二郎山”等优秀作品；整理和出版了二十多册有关民族、民间音乐资料的集子；通过出版的各种歌选及举办短期音乐训练班等，推动了群众音乐活动。但工作中也还存在着不少缺点，如作品产量少，赶不上群众需要，还有着公式化、概念化的倾向；群众音乐活动也还限于运动式的情况，不能经常进行等等。
    根据这次会议精神，西南区音乐工作者协会执行委员会最近拟订了一九五四年的工作计划。
    计划中首先提出将组织西南地区音乐工作者根据总路线的精神，积极从事创作。具体做法是：摸清全区各地的创作力量；要求各地会员小组按季向协会推荐优秀的音乐作品；通过机关刊物培养工农兵群众中的作曲人材；以各种社会活动方式组织批评活动；创造条件，准备在年终举办本年度优秀音乐作品评奖。
    西南区音乐工作者协会今年也准备有计划地组织会员从事音乐表演；协助各省、市音乐工作组开展群众音乐活动。计划经常举办内部的和公开的试唱、试奏会及演唱、演奏会；并组织一次小型的巡回观摩演出。计划中还要求通过各地会员的各种活动，发现和培养优秀的民间歌唱家和演奏家。同时有计划地组织会员进行民族、民间音乐及戏曲、曲艺音乐的收集、整理、研究等工作。
    此外，将组织会员从创作及表演的实践中发现问题，进行座谈讨论，开展批评和自我批评。办好机关刊物“西南音乐”。（敖学祺）
