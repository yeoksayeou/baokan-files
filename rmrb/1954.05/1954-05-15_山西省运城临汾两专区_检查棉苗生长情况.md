    Yuncheng and Linfen Special Districts, Shanxi Province
    Inspect Cotton Seedling Growth

    The cotton sowing in the Yuncheng and Linfen Special Districts in southern Shanxi Province has been completed. Currently, work is being actively carried out to check seedlings, transplant seedlings, replant, and prevent and control diseases and pests. According to preliminary statistics from Yuncheng Special District, more than 1,820,000 mu of cotton have been sown in the entire district, an increase of more than 144,000 mu compared with last year, exceeding this year's plan by more than 44,000 mu. Among them, six counties including Linjin and Ronghe planned to plant 718,000 mu of cotton, but actually planted 748,190 mu, exceeding the plan by more than 30,000 mu and an increase of 54,900 mu compared with last year. Linfen Special District can also complete the sowing task of 1,100,600 mu of cotton fields. According to incomplete statistics from twelve counties including Yicheng, Fencheng, and Quwo (out of a total of eighteen counties in the special district), more than 1,033,000 mu have been sown, exceeding the planned requirement by 11,288 mu.

    At present, the above two special districts are actively mobilizing farmers to check the emerged cotton seedlings, replant wherever there are gaps, eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges, ensure that the seedlings are complete and strong, and pay attention to topdressing, irrigation, and weeding. For example, Yuncheng Special District has allocated 200,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder to various places; farmers in Xie County and other places are actively purchasing powder sprayers. Farmers in Linfen Special District are also actively carrying out cotton seedling transplantation and replanting. (Guo Shi)

    山西省运城临汾两专区
    检查棉苗生长情况
    山西省南部运城、临汾二专区的棉花已播种完毕，目前正积极进行查苗、移苗、补种及防治病虫等工作。据运城专区的初步统计，全区已播种棉花一百八十二万多亩，比去年扩大十四万四千多亩，超过今年计划四万四千多亩。其中临晋、荣河等六县计划植棉七十一万八千亩，实播七十四万八千一百九十亩，超过计划三万多亩，比去年扩大五万四千九百亩。临汾专区亦能完成一百一十万零六千亩的棉田播种任务，据翼城、汾城、曲沃等十二个县
  （全专区共十八个县）的不完全统计，已播种一百零三万三千多亩，超过计划要求一万一千二百八十八亩。
    目前，上述两个专区正积极动员农民检查已出土的棉苗，随缺随补、消灭缺苗断垅等现象，保证苗全苗壮，并注意追肥、灌溉、锄苗，如运城专区已向各地调拨“六六六”药粉二十万斤；解县等地农民正积极购买喷粉器。临汾专区农民亦在积极进行棉花的移苗、补种工作。　（郭石）
