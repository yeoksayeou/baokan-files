    新建二号平炉开始出钢
   【新华社重庆九日电】重庆一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场二号平炉，已在五月八日下午六时零四分流出了第一炉钢水。当钢水散发着万道金光，从出钢口流进了巨大的盛钢桶时，新厂房里立刻爆发出掌声、鞭炮声和欢呼声，人们流露出了无限兴奋的喜悦。一零一钢铁厂厂长张振东立刻在广播器前向全厂职工宣布：“新建炼钢场从今天起，正式为祖国的社会主义工业化生产了。”
    新建炼钢场二号平炉在四月十七日点火，在五月八日早晨九点零三分开始进料。这一天，工人们把新建炼钢场雄伟的新厂房打扫得格外干净、敞亮。一零一厂厂长兼总指挥一再召集工程师和工长们研究和指挥操作。当日下午五点三刻，命令出钢的钟声响了。人们从炉前拥向炉后，屏息注视着出钢口，到六时零四分，平炉就吐出了红色的钢液。这一炉钢是垫板钢，经化验证明，质量很好。
