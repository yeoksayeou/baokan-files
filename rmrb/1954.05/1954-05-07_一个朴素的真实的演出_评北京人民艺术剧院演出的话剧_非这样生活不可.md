    A Simple and Authentic Performance
    ——Review of the Beijing People's Art Theatre's Play "One Must Live Like This"
    Wu Tian
    The new play "One Must Live Like This" by Soviet playwright Anatoly Surov, performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre in the capital, has been widely welcomed and praised by audiences. It truthfully and specifically reflects the lives of the working people of Democratic Germany; reflects their heroic struggle to build a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany; and reflects how they united the broad masses of people in the struggle, thereby crushing the enemy's slander and sabotage. Therefore, this play has a great inspiring and educational effect on the people of our country who are engaged in peaceful construction.

      "One Must Live Like This," like Anatoly Surov's other plays, unfolds its theme in stark conflict, with moving plots and strong drama. The story of the play describes how Karl, a worker in a steel plant in the German Democratic Republic, and his eldest son, Rudy, are preparing to use the Soviet quick steelmaking method to trial-smelt a new steel invented by Professor Leberke. But engineer Gruber opposes Karl's approach and refuses to cooperate with him. Some workers also adopt a wait-and-see attitude. West German warmongers take the opportunity to send special agent Hutter and Karl's third son, Franz, to sabotage. During the trial smelting process, the special agent blows up the furnace, and the trial work suffers a setback, but Karl persists. Engineer Gruber and old technician Scholz, who had adopted a wait-and-see attitude, finally wake up in the face of bloody lessons and study the trial smelting of new steel with Karl. In the end, the enemy's conspiracy is exposed, the special agent is arrested, and the trial smelting of new steel is finally successful.
    This play portrays complex contradictions: Karl and Franz are father and son, but also revolutionaries and traitors; Gruber and Leberke are friends for many years, but also opponents of quick steelmaking; Hutter attempts to exploit the young woman Elisa, while her fiancé is a member of the security staff of Democratic Germany. The events are complex and tortuous, but the plot development is very clear, and the contradictions are also very sharp. When dealing with these complex contradictions, the director can tightly grasp the main contradictions and conflicts in the script and highlight them, thus strongly displaying the theme, infecting the audience, and making people feel clean and clear after watching it.
    Another feature of this play is its rich atmosphere of life. The author lived in Germany after the war, and director Ouyang Shanzun also had the opportunity to observe life in Germany. All the actors also contacted German comrades and searched for rich life materials in literary works and other documents for this performance. However, acting is an art of experience, and it is impossible to create vivid character images by relying solely on a little observation or the collection of life materials. In the process of artistic creation, the directors and all the actors of the Beijing People's Art Theatre conscientiously followed the creative principle of "starting from life" and went deep into Chinese steel plants, laboratories, and nurseries to find the inherent common ideas and feelings between the Chinese and German peoples, that is: love of peace and opposition to war; love of life and love of labor; love of active creation of new life; hatred of the enemy and warmongers; and opposition to those who are selfish and indifferent to life. By going deep into life, they became familiar with the psychological state of the characters in the play, so that this performance basically overcame the shortcomings of simply imitating the external form in the past when performing foreign plays, and initially achieved a deep exploration of the inner world of the characters, correctly grasped the thoughts and feelings of the characters, and thus was able to make the audience feel close and breathe together with the characters in the play. In the handling of the entire play, it can also be seen that the director did not use more techniques to render the tight plot of the play. He simply and rigorously expressed life: the peaceful life of a worker's family; the tense life of workers and cadres in the factory during production; the life of professors; and the optimistic and cheerful life of young people. The entire stage is filled with the happy, joyful, and tense life of ordinary German working people, just like our familiar neighbors, who one day open the window and let us see their daily activities. Although special agent Hutter and Franz added a layer of shadow to this peaceful life, it can never be covered up. This vigorous spirit is especially manifested in the young group. The singing and dancing of Krall and Fritzl before and after announcing their marriage is a memorable scene.

    From the scene scheduling to the mastery of rhythm, although it is not smooth enough, it is basically based on the prescribed situation as the keynote and moves forward according to the reality of life.
    Among all the character images, Karl is the most prominent. This is a typical old worker in Democratic Germany, the backbone of the working class. Actor Diao Guangqin appropriately performed such a worker: he is as strong as steel in life, and has a deep passion for the people, the motherland, and his relatives. In him, there is an invincible and abundant perseverance, and this strength is precisely the noble quality of the German working class. This abundant vitality is enough to ignite the torch of construction and encourage people to move forward. When talking about his creative process of this role, Diao Guangqin said: "Saying that he (Karl) loves life is not as good as saying that he loves the main body of life even more - people, those who are building a new life with him and creating a beautiful future, as well as the masters of the beautiful life in the future, dear children. In the tense process of preparing for steelmaking, he took the time to go to the kindergarten to see his beloved little granddaughter. It is conceivable: when this gray-haired old man, after a tense day of work, gently knocks on the door of the kindergarten, eager to hug his little granddaughter, eager to let her grab his beard with her little hands and call him grandpa, what is his mood like? What does this mean? I know he is thinking: 'Everything is for you, my beloved children, the masters of the future!' Whenever I think of him narrating the lines about going to the kindergarten, I always seem to hear his inner voice, feel his caress, and I also deeply realize why he can have such a strong vitality and live and work tirelessly." (See Diao Guangqin: "A Model Worth Learning," "Guangming Daily," April 3, 1954) It can be seen from this that the actor entered the experience from imagination, and the actor did not perform emotions but used his own thoughts and feelings to experience the role, creating the actor's self-feeling. This is exactly what Stanislavsky requires of actors to "start from the self."
      "One must start from the self, not from that preconceived image: one must place oneself in the position of the image... one must remove the harmful (unnecessary for the image) things possessed by oneself (the actor), rather than add what I do not have." (See Zahava's "Vakhtangov and His Institute" quoted in "The Biography of Shchukin") Diao Guangqin's ability to achieve certain achievements is mainly due to mastering this principle. But another basic reason lies in the thoughts and feelings rooted in life experience that make him have conditions close to the role of Karl. Without this, he would not be able to complete the task. This is closely related to our requirements for the improvement of the ideological understanding of art workers.
    Due to experience, Diao Guangqin's performance is basically through inner activity, and then expressed in physical movements. When he agrees to let Franz stay, his inner contradictions about whether Franz can be reformed can be seen from his eyes and gestures. When he sternly says to engineer Gruber: "Please consider, there are gains and losses in life at any time, and this also includes losing trust!" It is less that he is angry than that he suffers after losing an object of love and respect. This shows his excellent and pure qualities. When he hears Scholz say that he is standing aside, from being insulted to suddenly waking up, and then sternly questioning Franz, asking him to think about what exactly was going on to pull him away when the furnace exploded, his seriousness is the concrete and concentrated expression of his sense of responsibility. Afterwards, when he knows that the murderer is his son, his pain and finally telling his wife, advising her to calm down while suppressing the discomfort in his heart: he regrets why he gave birth to such a son and introduced him into the factory, causing such a major loss to the people. Diao Guangqin even more expressed the indomitable spirit of this character. As for the amiable, humorous, and awe-inspiring character traits that have always run through the entire play, all of this has shaped a worker's typical image with flesh and blood, strong will, and rich emotions.
    When Diao Guangqin was handling the role of Karl, although he raised the identity of the role higher, his excellent acting skills broke through the common formulaic and conceptual performance of generally performing positive characters (Party committee secretary, government chief). It is worth everyone's attention.
    Tian Chong's old Professor Leberke showed his strong mental outlook and his loyalty in his sickness. In the scene where he argued with engineer Gruber in his home, although he was confined to a chair, this did not hinder his vitality and his desire for work. The actor basically focused on inner acting throughout the performance, so it was only the body that was sick, which is exactly the characteristic that the professor should have.
    What is significantly different from their performances is Zhao Yunru (playing Karl's wife Marta), who has skilled acting skills. Every process, every detail, she does so meticulously and realistically. When she speaks, works, or does some odd jobs while speaking, she never seems excessive, but only feels natural. However, there is a lack of depth of action in this, so she only embodies a general mother, but fails to take a step further to embody a mother of the German people who has experienced many hardships and has grown into a more noble and stronger person. At the same time, the growth of this increasingly clear emotion of the mother of the people cannot be seen from the entire performance. When she learns that Franz is a traitor and questions him head-on, she lacks complex inner activities (pain, hatred, and restraint not to let the other party see), and the final firm decision. Therefore, the action of asking Franz to face her becomes empty and weak. (People will even worry: will the special agent be discovered and run away? This is an extremely important key!) Due to the above reasons, when she finally denounced her son's treasonous behavior: "You have no mother, no motherland... you are an outsider... a running dog of American imperialism" (this is the most important and most difficult action), she had to become a general slogan.
    Engineer Gruber and Scholz belong to another aspect of the contradiction. Although they both belong to the characters to be won over, they have significant differences, and Gruber is the representative of them. Since this contradiction is a contradiction within the people, it finally ends with the transformation of the contradiction, that is, the change of the characters, to end this conflict. The biggest shortcoming of this role is the lack of a strong basis for transformation. Gruber's opposition to rapid steelmaking is because the factory and workers did not listen to his opinions, and his original intention was still to be afraid of damaging the furnace and wanted to persuade others to work according to his ideas. Although he was angry and refused to cooperate, he was an upright person and an honest person. He just insisted on his own opinion and was angered by the fact that his opinion was not adopted. However, the role played by Lan Tianye is so arrogant that he is unreasonable. He raises his face, puts his hands in his pockets, does not look at people directly, and does not see any enthusiasm for people and careers. Even when the professor's heart disease relapses suddenly due to arguing with him, he is indifferent (later performances have been slightly corrected, but basically the same). In this way, Gruber's later transformation said: "I am guilty," "One must live like this!" (No matter how he increases his tone) it doesn't feel natural no matter how you look at it. The current handling will make people wonder: after the rapid steelmaking happened unfortunately, why didn't he rejoice in the misfortune and insist on his wrong opinion even more? Only by providing the basic characteristics of the role of Gruber and handling the scene of arguing with the professor as a powerful beginning of inner transformation, that is, after Gruber's intense inner conflict, he broke through his previous understanding, can the expected effect be achieved. But we cannot see Gruber's inner struggle and some new things gradually awakening in him, and finally occupying a dominant position.
    Similarly, Scholz, played by Geng Zhen, also has a similar situation. What is the internal cause of his transformation? How do the criticisms of his children and the objective trend affect him? Why did Scholz come to Karl's house? The audience is in the dark after watching it. No wonder he only brings the audience an interesting image. Geng Zhen portrayed the humorous side of this character. He is stubborn, humorous, self-righteous, and likes to take petty advantages. This is indeed a ridiculous image common in life. But the actor did not emphasize the excellent essence of this character, and his enthusiasm for observing and understanding the situation when he came to Karl's house was covered by laughter. People forgot that he also has a desire to improve, and also has a thought to follow Karl and the others. In the performance, the actor is immersed in the pleasure caused by his own sense of humor, often leading the actor out of the core of the role, which causes the interruption of creation.
    This kind of "self-appreciation" is more obvious in Fang Guande's performance. Fang Guande's Dr. Hoffmann puts too much emphasis on pursuing the external slapstick that can make the audience laugh in some places, while he lacks a strong portrayal of Dr. Hoffmann's serious and responsible attitude towards the factory's safety and health work, and his patient care and cordial care for patients as a people's medical worker. Therefore, the impression that this character leaves on the audience is only that he is interesting, not that he is lovable.
    Among the negative characters, Hu Hao's (playing Franz) performance is worth mentioning. He is completely unlike the common actors who replace acting with external formulas when performing negative characters. First of all, starting from the character's mental outlook and psychological state, he meticulously expressed the character's unease, tension, constantly spying on people, probing people, and preparing to act; when being threatened with enticement, his inner activities can be seen through his eyes; and when being questioned, he showed a high degree of confusion. This is indeed the mental state of a small special agent. He wants to do it but is also worried. Hu Hao's excellent acting skills are fully revealed here. But the feeling that this role gives to the audience on the stage is that the reason why he became a special agent seems to be more due to coercion than due to willingness, which cannot but be said to be a shortcoming. If the actor can expose the psychological state and living habits naturally formed by him in a decadent life for a long time in some specific places, turning from being unable to restrain himself to being unscrupulous, instead of relying on some "theoretical basis" that does not fit the identity (Hu Hao said when talking about the creative process of this role that he decided that Franz was a person with firm belief in fascist theory and action, without involving his decadent life), this can arouse deeper hatred from the audience and receive further educational effects. (On this point, the script has certain restrictions on him.)
    Although the performance of "One Must Live Like This" still has some shortcomings, the whole thing is successful. It is carried out in a serious and earnest atmosphere, and it is carried out on the basis of being loyal to life, pursuing truth, and unifying them in artistic creation. Therefore, the whole thing appears simple, kind, and relatively complete. In terms of acting art, it has taken a step forward on the road to realistic acting. This is one of the excellent performances in recent years.
    Our realistic experiential art has already sprouted and is growing. The audience has further expectations for this precious sprout and its development.

    一个朴素的真实的演出
    ——评北京人民艺术剧院演出的话剧“非这样生活不可”
    吴天
    北京人民艺术剧院在首都演出的苏联剧作家安那托利·索夫洛诺夫的新作“非这样生活不可”话剧，受到了观众的普遍欢迎和称赞。它真实地、具体地反映了民主德国劳动人民的生活；反映了他们为建设和平、民主、统一的德国所进行的英勇斗争；反映了他们在斗争中团结了广大人民，从而摧毁了敌人的造谣中伤和暗算。因此，这个戏对正在进行和平建设的我国人民，有着极大的鼓舞力量和教育作用。
      “非这样生活不可”像安那托利·索夫洛诺夫的其他剧作一样，是在鲜明的冲突中展开主题，有着动人的情节，富于强烈的戏剧性。剧本的故事是描写德意志民主共和国某炼钢厂的工人卡尔和他的大儿子卢狄一道，准备用苏联的快速炼钢法来试炼莱别尔克教授发明的新钢。但工程师格鲁伯反对卡尔的做法，并拒绝和他合作。有些工人也采取观望态度。西德战争贩子们更乘机派遣特务休特尔和卡尔的三儿子佛兰茨进行破坏。试炼过程中，特务爆炸了炉子，试炼工作受到了挫折，但卡尔始终坚持，工程师格鲁伯和采取观望态度的老技术工人萧尔茨终于在血的教训中醒悟过来，与卡尔一道研究试炼新钢。最后，敌人的阴谋被揭露，特务被逮捕，试炼新钢工作终于成功。
    这个戏里刻划了复杂的矛盾：卡尔和佛兰茨之间是父和子，又是革命者和叛逆；格鲁伯和莱别尔克是多年的朋友，又是对待快速炼钢上的对立者；休特尔企图利用少女爱丽莎，而她的未婚夫却是民主德国的保卫工作人员。事件复杂曲折，但剧情的发展线索却很清楚，矛盾的开展也很尖锐。导演在处理这些复杂的矛盾时，能紧紧地掌握着剧本中的主要矛盾和冲突，并突出地表现了它，因此，强烈地显示了主题，感染了观众，使人看了觉得干净而明朗。
    这个戏演出的另一个特点是生活气息的浓郁。作者曾在战后的德国生活过，导演欧阳山尊也有过在德国观察生活的机会，所有演员也曾为了这次演出接触过德国同志并在文艺作品和其他文件中寻找丰富的生活资料。但是，演剧是体验的艺术，仅靠一点观察或生活资料的搜集是不可能创造生动的人物形象的。北京人民艺术剧院的导演和全体演员同志在艺术创造过程中，认真地按照“从生活出发”的创作原则，深入中国的炼钢厂、化验室、托儿所，在生活中寻找中德两国人民内在的共通思想感情，那就是：热爱和平，反对战争；热爱生活，热爱劳动；热爱新生活的积极创造；痛恨敌人，痛恨战争挑拨者；反对那些自私自利对生活冷眼旁观的人们。在深入生活中，熟悉剧中人物的心理状态，使这次演出基本上克服了过去演外国戏时单纯从外形摹拟的缺点，初步做到深入探索人物的内心世界，正确地掌握人物的思想感情，因而能使观众感到亲切，能与剧中人物共同呼吸。在整个戏的处理上，也可以看出导演并没有用更多的技巧来渲染这一剧本紧凑的情节，他只是严谨地、朴素地表现了生活：工人家庭的恬静生活；工厂中工人、干部生产时紧张的生活；教授的生活；青年人的乐观愉快生活。整个舞台上洋溢着普通德国劳动人民的幸福、愉快紧张的生活，就好像我们熟悉的街坊邻舍，有一天打开窗子，让我们看到了他们的日常活动一样。虽然特务休特尔和弗兰茨给这个恬静的生活上加上了一层阴影，可是绝不能掩盖住它。这种蓬勃的朝气，特别表现在年青的一群中。克拉勒与弗利特利许宣布结婚前后的唱歌和跳舞是足够回味的场面。
    从场面调度到节奏的掌握，虽然还不够流畅，但基本上都是以规定的情景做基调，按着生活的真实向前推进的。
    在所有的人物形象中，卡尔是最为突出的一个。这是一个典型的民主德国的老工人，工人阶级队伍中的骨干。演员刁光覃适如其分地表演了这样一个工人：他在生活中锻炼得像钢铁，对人民、对祖国以及对自己亲人有着深邃的热情。在他的身上有一股不可战胜的充沛的毅力，这种力量正是德国工人阶级的高贵品质。这一充沛的活力，足以点燃建设的火炬，鼓舞着人们前进。刁光覃在谈他创作这个角色的经过时说：“说他（卡尔）热爱生活，不如说他更爱生活的主体——人，那些与他一道建设着新生活的创造美好未来的人们，以及未来的美好生活的主人，亲爱的孩子们。在紧张的炼钢的准备过程中，他曾抽暇到幼儿园去，看过他心爱的小孙女。可以想见：当这个白发苍苍的老人，在一天紧张的劳动之后，轻扣着幼儿园的门扉，渴望着抱抱他的小孙女，渴望着让她用小手抓着胡子叫他声爷爷时的心情是怎么样的？这意味着什么？我知道他在想：‘一切都为了你们啊，我爱得心疼的孩子们，未来的主人们！’每当我想起他叙说自己到幼儿园去的台词时，我总似乎是听到了他的心声，感受到他的爱抚，也就更深刻地体会到他之所以能够有那样旺盛的生命力，不疲倦的生活着工作着的原因。”（见刁光覃：“值得学习的榜样”，一九五四年四月三日“光明日报”）从这里可以看出，从想像进入了体验，演员不是表演感情而是用自己的思想感情体验了角色，创造了演员的自我感觉。这正是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基所要求演员的“从自我出发”。
      “必须从自我出发，而不是从那预先想好的形象出发：必须把自己本人置身于形象的地位中……必须去掉自己（演员）所具有的有妨害的（为形象所不需要的）东西，而不是去增加我所没有的东西。”（见“史楚金传”中所引扎哈瓦：“瓦赫坦戈夫及其研究所”）刁光覃所以能获得一定的成就，主要就在于掌握了这一原则。但另一个基本原因却在于生根于生活经历的思想感情使他具有了与卡尔这一角色接近的条件，没有这个，他将无法完成任务。这就与我们要求艺术工作者思想认识的提高紧密地联系着。
    由于体验，刁光覃的表演基本上是通过内在的活动，然后表现在形体动作上。当他答应佛兰茨留下时，从他的眼神和手势中可以看出他对佛兰茨是否可以改造的这一问题的内心矛盾。当他正言厉色地对工程师格鲁伯说：“请你考虑考虑，人生中随时有得失的，这也包括失掉信任！”与其说他愤怒，不如说他失掉了爱戴和尊敬的对象以后所遭受的痛苦。这显现了他品质的优良和淳厚。当他听见萧尔茨说他站在一边时，从受污辱到蓦然惊醒，然后严词质问佛兰茨，要他想想究竟有什么事要在炉子爆炸时把他拉开，他的认真正是他的责任感的具体集中的表现。其后当他知道凶手就是他儿子时的痛苦以及最后告诉他妻子，一面劝告她镇定一面压抑不住自己内心的难受：他悔恨自己为什么生这末一个儿子，并把他引进厂内，使得人民遭受如此重大的损失。刁光覃更表现了这一人物顽强的打击不倒的精神面貌。至于和蔼可亲、风趣而又凛然不可侵犯的性格特征一直贯串了全剧，这一切塑造了一个有血有肉、意志坚强而具有丰富感情的工人典型。
    刁光覃在处理卡尔这一人物时，虽然把角色的身分提得较高，但他的优秀的演技却突破了一般表演正面人物（党委书记，政府首长）所常见的公式化、概念化的表演。值得大家的重视。
    田冲扮演的老教授莱别尔克在病态中表现了他的坚强的精神面貌，表现了他的忠心耿耿。在他家里与工程师格鲁伯展开争论的一场戏中，他虽被限制在椅子里，可是这并没有妨碍了他的活力和对工作的渴望。演员在整个演出中基本上着重了内心的演技，因而病的只是躯体，这正是教授这一人物所应具有的特点。
    和他们的表演有较显著不同的是赵韫如（饰卡尔妻玛尔塔），她有熟练的演技。每一过程，每一细节，她都做得那末细致、逼真。当她说话时、工作时，或是一面说话一面干零星活时，从不显得过火，只觉得自然。可是，这里面缺少了动作的深度，因此，她只体现了一般的母亲，而未能跨进一步，体现一个饱经忧患，已经成长为一个更崇高、更坚强的德国人民的母亲的形象。同时，从整个表演中未能看到这种越来越明确的人民大众母亲的感情的增长。在她得悉佛兰茨是个叛徒，正面追问他时，缺少内心的复杂的活动（痛苦、憎恨以及不让对方看出的克制）和最后坚强的决定。因而要佛兰茨面对着她的那一动作就成为空泛无力的了。（人们甚至会担心：会不会让特务发现，因而逃跑，这是一个极为重要的关键！）由于上述的原因，当她最后指斥儿子的叛国行为：“你没有妈妈，也没有祖国……你是个外人……美帝国主义的走狗”（这是最重要也是最难的动作）的时候，就不得不成为一般的口号。
    格鲁伯工程师与萧尔茨同属矛盾的另一个方面。他们虽同属被争取的人物，但却有显著的区别，而格鲁伯是其中的代表。由于这一矛盾是人民内部的矛盾，所以最后就以矛盾的转化，也就是人物的转变来结束了这一冲突。这个角色最大的缺点是缺少转变的有力的根据。格鲁伯反对快速炼钢是为了厂方和工人不听从他的主张，其本意还是为了怕损坏炉子，想说服别人按他的想法去工作，他尽管愤怒，尽管拒绝合作，可是他是一个正派人，一个老实人。他只是坚持自己的意见，为自己的意见不被采纳而激怒。可是蓝天野扮演的这一个角色却倨傲到不近人情，他仰着?子，插着双手，不用正眼看人，对人对事业没有看出他丝毫的热情。甚至在教授的心脏病为了与他争辩猝然复发时，也无动于衷（后来的演出略有改正，但基本上一样）。这样，格鲁伯后来转变说：“我有罪，”“非这样生活不可！”（不管他如何在语势上加重）就怎末看也觉得不够自然。现在的处理将使人怀疑：在快速炼钢发生不幸以后，为什么他不幸灾乐祸，更坚持他的错误的意见呢？只有提供了格鲁伯这一角色的基本特征，并把与教授争论的一场戏处理为内心转变的有力的开始，也就是格鲁伯在内心的激烈冲突后，突破了以往的认识，才能达到预期的效果。可是我们看不见格鲁伯的内心斗争以及某种新的事物在他身上逐渐的觉醒，最后占有统治的地位。
    同样，耿震扮演的萧尔茨也有类似的情形。什么是他转变的内因呢？儿女的批评和客观的趋势怎样在他身上起影响的呢？萧尔茨来到卡尔家里究竟为什么？观众看了不摸底。无怪他给观众只带来一个仅止于有趣的形象。耿震刻划了这个人物幽默的一面，他固执、风趣、自以为是，好占小便宜，这确是一个生活中常见的可笑的形象。但是对于这个人物的优良的本质的一面，演员却并未予以强调，他到卡尔家里观察了解情况的热情被哄笑遮盖了。人们忘了他也有一个要求上进的心，也有一个想跟随卡尔他们走的想念。在表演中，演员浸沉于自己的幽默感所造成的愉快，常引离演员脱出角色的核心，这便造成创作的中断。
    这种“自我欣赏”，在方琯德的表演上表现得较为明显，方琯德扮演的郝富曼大夫在某些地方太着重于追求那些可以引起观众发笑的外形上的滑稽，而对于郝富曼大夫严肃认真地对工厂的安全卫生工作负责，对病人耐心照顾，亲切关怀的人民医务工作者的品质方面缺少有力的刻划。因此，这个人物给观众留下的印象只是觉得他有趣，并不觉得他可爱。
    在反面人物中，胡浩（饰佛兰茨）的表演是值得提出的。他完全不像常见的演员那样表演反面人物时以外形的公式代替了表演。首先从角色的精神面貌与心理状态出发，他细致地表达了角色的不安、紧张、随时在窥伺人、试探人并准备行动；在被威胁利诱时，通过眼神可以看出他一系列的内心活动；在被质问时表现了高度的惶惑。这确是一个小特务的精神状态。他想干又有所顾忌。胡浩的优秀演技在这里有着充分的表露。但是这角色在舞台上给观众的感觉，似乎他之所以当特务，由于威迫的原因远超过由于心甘情愿，这不能不说是一个缺点。如果演员能在某些特定的地方暴露了他长期在糜烂生活中所自然形成的心理状态和生活习惯，从不克自拔转入肆无忌惮，而不是依靠一些不合身分的“理论根据”，（胡浩在谈到创作这一角色的经过时说，他把佛兰茨决定为具有坚决信仰法西斯理论与行动的人物，而未涉及其糜烂的生活。）这就可以使观众激起更深切的仇恨，收到进一步的教育效果。（关于这一点，剧本对他有一定的限制。）
    “非这样生活不可”的演出虽然还存在某些缺点，但整个看来是成功的，是在严肃、认真的空气之中进行的，是在忠于生活，追求真实，并使它们在艺术创造上获得统一的基础之上进行的。因此整个显出朴素、亲切，也比较完整。在演剧艺术上，在走向现实主义演剧的道路上跨进了一步。这是一次近年来优秀的演出之一。
    我们现实主义的体验艺术已经在萌芽，在成长。这个可贵的萌芽及其发展，观众对它是有进一步的期待的。
