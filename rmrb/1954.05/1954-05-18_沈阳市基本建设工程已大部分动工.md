    【This article was transmitted from Shenyang on the 17th of this month】Major basic construction projects in Shenyang have mostly started. Preliminary statistics from early May show that the area under construction for civil engineering projects has reached over 72% of the total planned for the first phase, essentially achieving the planned start. These projects already underway include station buildings, transformer substations, warehouses, schools, dormitories, and clubs. The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, a key national machine industry construction project, has seen over ten projects commencing since April, including a newly built automated foundry workshop and a renovated forging workshop. The Shenyang Wire Factory has begun demolishing old factory buildings. The rubber, paper, and chemical plants have also started construction on factory buildings, warehouses, and other projects. In the education sector, projects underway include the soil analysis laboratory building for the Northeast Academy of Sciences, three new middle schools being built by the Shenyang Municipal Education Bureau, and the Shenyang Forestry School. Before the start of construction, most construction units prepared construction organization designs, organized workers to discuss and formulate work plans, and studied operating procedures and quality standards. The construction sites now present a scene of intense activity. Workers at construction site 116 have submitted over 40 rationalization proposals within a month of starting work, of which 23 have been adopted and implemented. Workers at construction sites 332 and 219 have promoted the use of North China lime to replace cement in order to save cement for the state. The bricklaying project at construction site 219 alone is expected to save over 950 tons of cement annually.
