    英国内阁会议
    拒绝在东南亚承担新义务
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日讯：据报纸消息，英国外交大臣艾登二十四日在英国内阁会议上做了报告，谈到英国代表团在今后日内瓦会议上对远东问题所要采取的立场。据路透社说，一些外交人士表示，艾登已“征得内阁的同意，继续在日内瓦会议上谋求建立印度支那的和平，而使英国不承担先决的军事义务和政治义务。虽然英国已遭到美国和法国方面的尖锐指责，英国直到现在还是要在日内瓦会议结果分晓以前，在东南亚拒绝承担任何新的义务。”
    内阁会议还讨论了关于五国（美国、法国、英国、澳大利亚和新西兰）参谋长会议的一些问题，这一会议订于六月一日在华盛顿开始举行。
