    The complete mechanization installation project of the small rolling mill workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant started full-scale construction on May 3, was completed and test-run on May 14, and was officially put into production on May 15.
    During the installation process, workers of all trades generally carried out labor competitions, giving full play to the high level of enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, overcoming all difficulties, ensuring the quality of the project, and completing the entire installation plan two days ahead of schedule. Veteran technical workers such as Zeng Guanming, Wang Quan, and Xin Kejian worked tirelessly and insisted on checking the progress of the project at any time. All the staff of the electrical repair team and riveter Zhang Renxiu, etc., found more than 300 jin of waste wire, six old electric hammers, and channel steel, etc. in the waste pile, and used waste oil switches, after processing, to replace the contactors, and repaired two old 20-horsepower motors for use. This not only saved raw materials for the country, but also enabled the completion of five electrical projects such as the cutting roller table electrical equipment and the rough rolling cutting head machine motor two days ahead of schedule. For example, the lathe team created a new record of machining three sets of five-piece bronze bushings for the rough rolling mill in one shift, which increased work efficiency by two times.
    The early completion and commissioning of the complete mechanization installation project of the small rolling mill workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has changed the situation in the past eleven years where workers could only rely on manual labor, and also greatly saved labor, improved labor productivity, accelerated the speed of steel production, and improved the output and quality of products, which will increase a large amount of wealth for the country. For example, the heating furnace used to require eighteen people per shift to operate, but after mechanization, only one person is needed. From loading, exiting the furnace to the roughing mill, as long as one person flips the switch, the pusher will automatically send the steel billet into the furnace. After heating, the ejector will push the steel billet out, and then the automatic roller table will send it to the roughing mill. After the steel is roughly rolled, it enters the finishing mill through the automatic chute. In the past, the first pass of the finishing mill required three people to operate, lifting the red-hot iron and then sending it into the pass, which wasted manpower and prolonged the rolling time. Now one person is enough. In particular, the installation of the "anti-circumferential disk" has greatly improved the output and quality of steel. The installation of the finished product conveying ground roller has saved a large amount of labor. In the past, people had to manually take the steel to the trolley, hold the trolley and push it away, and then transfer it to the stockyard. Now, the steel is directly sent to the stockyard after being sawed.
    The small rolling mill workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is now a fully mechanized production workshop. Now the workers are stepping up their learning of new technical operations in order to complete the national production plan ahead of schedule.

    太原钢铁厂小型轧钢全部机械化
    太原钢铁厂小型轧钢车间全部机械化安装工程，从五月三日开始全面施工，到五月十四日完工并进行试车，五月十五日正式投入生产。
    在安装过程中，各工种工人普遍开展了劳动竞赛，发挥了工人阶级高度的积极性与创造性，战胜了一切困难，保证了工程的质量，提前两天完成了全部安装计划。老技术工人曾官明、王全、辛克俭等不辞辛苦，坚持随时检查工程的进度。电修班全体职工和铆工张仁秀等，在废料堆里找回三百多斤废电线、六个旧电鎯头及槽铁等，并利用废油开关，经过加工，代替了接触器，又把两个二十马力的旧马达修理好用上了。不但给国家节省了原料，而且使切料辊道电气设备、粗轧切头机电机等五项电气工程提前两天完工。又如元车组在车粗轧机三层牙轮五金瓦时，创造了一个班车三付的新纪录，工作效率提高了两倍。
    太原钢铁厂小型轧钢车间全部机械化安装工程提前完工并投入生产，改变了过去十一年来工人只能依靠体力操作的情况，而且大大节省了劳动力，提高了劳动生产率，加快了生产钢材的速度，提高了产品的产量和质量，将给国家增产大量财富。如加热炉以前每班要十八个人操作，机械化以后只需一个人了。从装料、出炉到初轧机，只要由一个人将电门开关一扳，推钢机便自动将钢胚送进炉内，经过加热，由顶钢机将钢胚顶出，再由自动辊道送到初轧机。钢材经过粗轧后，即经自动跑槽进入细轧机。以前细轧机第一架孔型，需要三个人操作，将红铁抬起来再送入孔型，这样既浪费人力，又延长了轧制时间。现在用一个人就够了。特别是“反围盘”的安装，使钢材的产量和质量大大提高。成品输送地辊的安装，更节省了大批劳动力。过去是用人力将钢材拿到小车上，用手扶着车子推去，再拨到料场，现在钢材经过锯断以后直接就到了料场。
    太原钢铁厂小型轧钢车间已经是一个完全机械化生产的车间了。现在工人们正在加紧学习新的技术操作，为提前完成国家生产计划而奋斗。
