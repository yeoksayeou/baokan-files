    How We Lead Bookstore Work
    Shi Lei, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Ningjin County Party Committee, CCP
    Since its establishment in 1947, the Xinhua Bookstore Ningjin Branch in Hebei has made great progress in its work under the leadership of the Party Committee. The Party Committee attaches great importance to the work of the bookstore and has regarded the publication and distribution of books and periodicals as an important component of propaganda work. The Party Committee includes the leadership of distribution work as an item in its work plans and summaries. The central work plans, programs, and propaganda and education work plans issued by the Party Committee are also given to the bookstore. This enables the distribution work to closely cooperate with the Party's central work in each period.

    Strengthening the Party Committee's political and ideological leadership over the bookstore is the key to doing a good job in distribution work. The Party Committee organizes the Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in the bookstore together with the Party members and members of the Communist Youth League of the County Committee to participate in organizational activities so as to understand the work and ideological situation of the bookstore staff at any time and carry out political and ideological work. The political and theoretical study of the bookstore staff is also conducted under the unified leadership of the Propaganda Department. When important meetings are held within the bookstore, the Propaganda Department sends people to participate and provides many suggestions before the meeting. In the past, when some staff members went out to promote books, some people said: "The bookstore is really good at exploiting opportunities. Whenever there is a meeting, they come to sell books," and "The work of the bookstore is doing small business." The Party Committee promptly pointed out that this view was wrong. This enabled the bookstore staff to feel at ease in their work. In August 1953, the bookstore received more than 100 sacks of textbooks, which were transported to the warehouse for storage overnight. Later, when it encountered heavy rain, the house leaked and collapsed, but the textbooks were not damaged under the protection of the bookstore comrades. In particular, the comrades who do mobile supply work can overcome wind and rain and heat and cold to timely supply books and periodicals to the masses in various villages.

    The Party Committee also pays attention to grasping the guidelines and policies and conducts specific leadership over distribution work. The Party Committee often instructs the bookstore to carry out distribution work around the central work. For example, when propaganda for the Party's general line during the transition period in the country began last winter, the Party Committee told the bookstore to cooperate in carrying out the work. At the county, district, and township three-level cadre conferences, the Party Committee also introduced relevant reading materials to everyone. During the conference, the bookstore promptly supplied about 1,000 copies of relevant reading materials promoting the Party's general line. In October 1953, in order to do a good job in the general election propaganda work, the Propaganda Department convened a meeting of propaganda and education departments to specifically study the work of book and periodical distribution. The meeting decided to distribute 1,800 copies of the "General Election Propaganda Manual" through the County Committee, the County Federation of Trade Unions, the Culture and Education Bureau, and other systems. At the beginning of the general election work, the bookstore sold more than 2,400 copies of relevant general election documents, most of which were planned for distribution. This enabled the bookstore to clearly recognize its responsibilities in various movements and realize the political significance of the bookstore work. The Party Committee helps the bookstore review plans, study the notices and instructions of higher-level bookstores, and help the bookstore grasp the quantity of purchases and sales. When publicizing the Party's general line during the transition period in the country, the Party Committee reviewed and approved the bookstore's key distribution plan. The number of key books proposed by the bookstore was too low, and the Party Committee immediately instructed them to increase it as appropriate. The Party Committee also provides the bookstore with reliable basis for the quantity of purchases and sales at any time. In 1952, the Ningjin Branch had a great deal of blindness in its purchasing work, and a lot of books were overstocked. Beginning in 1953, the Party Committee helped the bookstore gradually reverse this tendency. For example, when studying "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union," the Party Committee told the bookstore the number of needs investigated, and the bookstore promptly purchased goods, met the needs of learning, and did not cause overstocking. While correcting the bookstore's blind purchasing, the Party Committee also emphasized that it should not therefore produce a tendency to be constrained. Coupled with the bookstore's leading cadres' emphasis on mastering the business, the supply and demand of books has been initially improved.

    The Party Committee also pays attention to explaining the significance of the bookstore's work to cadres and the masses at various meetings and correcting the erroneous ideas of underestimating the bookstore's work. The Propaganda Department of the Party Committee compiled and printed the "Propaganda Broadcasting Blackboard Newspaper Materials," and often introduced books to the people of the county in this publication; the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee also issued a notice instructing the district committees to assist the bookstore's staff working in the countryside in carrying out propaganda.

    Due to the Party Committee's strengthened leadership and the efforts of the bookstore staff, the bookstore's work has been greatly improved. The bookstore's contact with readers has been closer. The masses reflected: "The bookstore comrades have a really good service spirit. Whatever books we need, they send them to us!" When the bookstore comrades went to the countryside to sell books, the masses reflected: "Regardless of the wind and rain, the bookstore comrades are not afraid of hardships to bring the books, we must take good care of them." Readers also feel very kind when they come to the bookstore. The bookstore's distribution business has also been greatly developed. For example, when publicizing the general line, the bookstore sold thousands of books related to the general line to farmers, which played a great role in raising the socialist consciousness of farmers, and at the same time laid a good foundation for future rural distribution work.

    我们是怎样领导书店工作的
    中共宁津县委宣传部部长　石磊
    新华书店河北宁津支店自一九四七年成立以来，在党委的领导下，工作有了很大的进展。党委对书店工作的领导是重视的，已把书刊发行工作当做宣传工作的重要组成部分。党委宣传部计划和总结工作时都把对发行工作的领导问题列为一项。党委印发的中心工作计划、方案和宣传教育工作计划等也都给书店一份。这样使发行工作紧密地配合了党在每个时期的中心工作。
    加强党委对书店的政治思想领导，是搞好发行工作的关键。党委把书店中的党员、团员和县委会的党员、团员编在一起过组织生活，以便随时了解书店工作人员的工作和思想情况，进行政治思想工作。书店工作人员的政治理论学习，也在宣传部统一领导下进行。书店内部召开重要会议时，宣传部派人参加，会前也提供许多意见。过去有些工作人员出去推销书籍时，有些人说：“书店真会钻空子，遇到开会，他们就来卖书”，“书店工作是做小买卖”。党委就及时指出这种观点是错误的。这样就使书店工作人员安心做好自己的工作。一九五三年八月书店收到一百多麻袋的课本，连夜运到库房存放，后来遇到大雨，房屋漏了，塌了，但在书店同志的保护下课本并未受到损失。尤其是做流动供应工作的同志，能够不避风雨和寒暑，及时供应各村群众书刊。
    党委还注意掌握方针政策，对发行工作进行具体领导。党委经常指示书店围绕中心工作进行发行工作。比如，去冬开始宣传党在国家过渡时期的总路线时，党委就告诉书店配合进行工作。在县、区、乡三级干部大会上，党委还向大家介绍了有关的读物。在大会中书店就及时供应了有关宣传党的总路线的读物一千册左右。一九五三年十月份，宣传部为了做好普选宣传工作，曾召开宣传教育部门会议专门研究书刊发行工作，会上决定通过县委会、县工会、文教科等系统发行“普选宣传手册”一千八百册。在普选工作开始时，书店就售出有关普选文件二千四百余册，其中大部分是计划发行的。这就使书店在各种运动中明确认识了自己的责任，体会了书店工作的政治意义。党委帮助书店审查计划，研究上级书店的通知和指示，帮助书店掌握进销数量。在宣传党在国家过渡时期的总路线时，党委就审订了书店的重点发行计划。书店提出的重点书进货数字偏低了，党委立即指示他们酌量增加。党委并随时给书店的进销数量提供可靠的根据。一九五二年宁津支店进货工作的盲目性很大，书籍积压很多。一九五三年开始，党委帮助书店逐步扭转了这种偏向。如学习
  “联共（布）党史”时，党委把调查的需要数量告诉书店，书店及时进货，满足了学习需要，并未造成积压。党委在纠正书店盲目进货的同时，也着重指出不要因此而产生束手束脚的偏向。加上书店领导干部重视掌握业务，使书籍的供需情况得到初步改善。
    党委还注意在各种会议上向干部、群众说明书店工作的意义，纠正轻视书店工作的错误思想。党委宣传部编印了“宣传广播黑板报资料”，经常在该刊上向全县人民介绍书籍；党委宣传部还发出通知，指示各区委协助书店下乡工作人员进行宣传。
    由于党委加强了领导和书店工作人员们的努力，书店的工作有了很大改进。书店与读者的联系密切了。群众反映：“书店同志服务精神真好。我们需要什么书，他们就送什么书来！”当书店同志下乡流动售书时，群众反映：“不管刮风下雨，书店同志都不怕艰苦把书带来，我们要好好地照顾他们。”读者到书店里也感到很亲切。书店的发行业务也有了很大的开展。比如，在宣传总路线时，书店就向农民卖出了数千册有关总路线的读物，对于提高农民的社会主义觉悟起了很大作用，同时为今后的农村发行工作打下了很好的基础。
