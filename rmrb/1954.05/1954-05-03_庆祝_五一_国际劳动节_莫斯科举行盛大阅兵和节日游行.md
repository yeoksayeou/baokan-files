    Celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day
    Moscow Holds Grand Military Parade and Festive Parade
    On May 1st, a grand military parade and a festive parade of the working people took place on Red Square in Moscow.
    On this day, Moscow was decorated more beautifully than usual. The bright sunshine shone on the streets and squares of Moscow. From early morning, millions of working people, carrying flowers and flags, headed towards the various streets of the capital and Red Square. The joyful festive music and songs echoed everywhere. On Red Square, the buildings opposite the Kremlin were hung with huge portraits of V.I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, and J.V. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, the national emblems and flags of the sixteen republics, the slogans of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party celebrating "May Day," and green garlands. The national emblems and flags of the Russian Federation and Ukraine stood out particularly brightly on the building of the Historical Museum not far from Red Square.
    Several thousand workers, scientists, artists, collective farmers from the Moscow region, and Soviet military officers filled the stands near the Kremlin Palace wall. Also on the reviewing stands on Red Square were dozens of foreign delegations and members of foreign diplomatic missions and military attachés to the Soviet Union.
    A few minutes before the parade, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government ascended the reviewing stand. They were warmly welcomed by the people on Red Square.
    The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, inspected the troops. After inspecting the troops and extending festive greetings to them, he ascended the reviewing stand and delivered a speech. He called on all the Soviet people to achieve new successes in the work of developing the economy and culture, improving the people's living standards, and continuously advancing the Soviet motherland. He pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to further increase labor productivity, more resolutely improve quality and reduce production costs, more widely launch socialist competition to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan, more rapidly eliminate shortcomings in the work of various economic sectors, and improve the work of state organs. The personnel of the Soviet armed forces must continue to steadfastly enrich their military and political knowledge and strive for perfection in improving combat technology.
    After Marshal Bulganin's speech, a majestic "Hurrah" resounded from the orderly ranks of the Soviet army. At this time, the Soviet national anthem and festive salutes intertwined.
    Then, the parade began. Leading the way was the mixed contingent of students from military academies, rightly called the melting pot of Soviet military officer cadres. Under the command of graduates of this academy, the Soviet army had achieved many immortal feats, and is now striving for perfection in improving combat technology.
    A blue and white silk flag appeared, reminding the people on Red Square of the vast ocean. The flag was held by a vigorous young man, followed by naval soldiers marching with firm steps. Next, students from the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Infantry School, border guards, and students from the Suvorov Military School and the Nakhimov Naval School marched across Red Square. Trucks carrying paratroopers drove past Red Square.
    The Taman Rifle Division (Guards Division) entered Red Square with its glorious battle flag. Rows of large armored personnel carriers drove across Red Square, followed by many cars towing artillery and mortars. At this time, jet bombers and fighters appeared in the sky. They swept over Red Square at an amazing speed.
    After the military parade, the festive parade of the working people of Moscow immediately began. An endless stream of people—workers, farmers, scientists, writers, artists, and students—cheered and sang as they marched mightily across Red Square.
    Above the parade was an ocean of red flags. The marchers held high portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, Malenkov, Molotov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Saburov, and Pervukhin. They also held placards and banners bearing the slogans of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party celebrating "May Day."
    Workers from Moscow factories carried charts showing new labor achievements to participate in the parade. Under the initiative of Moscow workers, socialist competition has been widely launched in Soviet industrial enterprises to strive for further increases in labor productivity and to strive for better utilization of modern technical equipment. The working people of Moscow have already overproduced many machine tools, machines, metals, tools, and other products this year. Currently, they, together with the people of the whole country, are victoriously carrying out the great task of rapidly increasing the production of consumer goods.
    Staff members of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, which will soon open in Moscow, teachers and students of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, and staff members of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of State Farms, walked across Red Square carrying flowers, green branches, and apple tree branches. From the production charts held by the marchers, one can see the enormous help Moscow enterprises and scientific institutions are providing to agriculture.
    Songs praising the happy life of the Soviet people and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union resounded on Red Square. People carried huge models of the national emblems of the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian Republic. The two national emblem models were connected by a long strip of silk with the words "Forever Together" written on it, which was particularly eye-catching.
    Muscovites marched forward holding hundreds of large flags with slogans calling for defending world peace and strengthening the friendship of the peoples of all countries. The marchers warmly cheered the foreign guests standing on the reviewing stand.
    The marchers held portraits of the leaders of the Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and governments of the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The marchers also held portraits of the leaders of the Communist Parties of France, Italy, the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, India, and Brazil.
    The parade of students from Moscow University came. There are young men and women of fifty-nine nationalities studying there now, including young people from the People's Republic of China, Korea, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Albania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Next came the ranks of scientists, engineers, writers, construction workers, teachers, etc. They are engaged in constructive labor for peace and progress.
    The festive parade of the working people of Moscow lasted for five hours. This parade clearly demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the Soviet people, the Communist Party, and the Soviet government, as well as the unwavering will of the Soviet people to defend and consolidate peace, further ease international tensions, and strengthen international cooperation.

    庆祝“五一”国际劳动节
    莫斯科举行盛大阅兵和节日游行
    五月一日，莫斯科的红场上举行了盛大的阅兵和劳动人民的节日游行。
    这一天，莫斯科打扮得比平日更加美丽了。明媚的阳光照耀着莫斯科的街道和广场。从清晨起，千千万万的劳动人民拿着鲜花和旗帜走向首都的各个街道和红场。到处回响着欢乐的节日乐声和歌声。在红场上，克里姆林宫对面的建筑物上挂着苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的缔造者乌·伊·列宁和列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林的巨幅画像、十六个加盟共和国的国徽和国旗、苏联共产党中央委员会庆祝“五一”节的口号和绿色的花环。离红场不远的历史博物馆的建筑物上，俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰的国徽和国旗显得分外耀目。
    几千个工人、科学家、艺术家、莫斯科州集体农民和苏联军官站满了克里姆林宫宫墙附近的观礼台。在红场观礼台上的还有几十个外国代表团和各国驻苏联外交使团的人员及武官。
    在阅兵前几分钟，苏联共产党和政府的领袖们登上了检阅台。他们受到了红场上的人民的热烈欢迎。
    苏联国防部部长、苏联元帅尼·亚·布尔加宁检阅部队。在检阅了部队并向他们致节日的祝贺以后，他登上了检阅台，并发表了演说。他号召全体苏联人民在发展经济和文化、提高人民生活水平并使苏维埃祖国不断进步的工作中取得新的成就。他指出：为了达到这个目的，必须进一步提高劳动生产率，更坚毅地改进质量和减低生产成本，更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛来完成和超额完成国民经济计划，更迅速地消灭经济各部门工作中的缺点，改进国家机关的工作。苏联武装部队的人员必须继续坚持不渝地丰富他们的军事和政治知识，精益求精地改进战斗技术。
    布尔加宁元帅演说毕，整齐的苏军队伍中响起了雄壮的“乌拉”声。这时，苏联国歌声和节日的礼炮声交织在一起。
    接着，阅兵式开始。走在前面的是被人们正确地称为苏军军官干部的熔炉的军事学院的学员混合大队。在这个学院的毕业生的指挥下，苏联军队曾取得了许多不朽的战绩，现在正在精益求精地提高着战斗技术。
    一面蓝白色的丝旗出现了，使红场上的人们想起了广阔的海洋。拿着旗帜的是一个矫健活泼的青年，在他后面的是走着坚定步伐的海军士兵。接着，俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃步兵学校的学生、边防军和苏沃罗夫军事学校及纳希莫夫军校的学生走过红场。卡车载着伞兵驶过红场。
    塔曼来福枪师（近卫师）带着光荣的战旗进入红场。成排的大装甲运兵车在红场上开过，后面是许多汽车拖着的大炮和迫击炮。这时，喷气轰炸机和战斗机在天空出现了。它们以惊人的速度掠过红场上空。
    阅兵式结束后，莫斯科劳动人民的节日游行立即开始。无穷无尽的人——工人、农民、科学家、作家、艺术家、学生们欢呼着、歌唱着，浩浩荡荡地走过红场。
    在游行队伍的上面的是海洋般的红旗。游行者高举着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林以及苏联共产党和政府的领袖马林科夫、莫洛托夫、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、萨布罗夫和别尔乌辛的画像。他们还举着上面写有苏联共产党中央委员会庆祝“五一”节口号的标语牌和横旗。
    莫斯科各工厂的工人拿着注明新的劳动成就的图表牌来参加游行。在莫斯科工人的发起下，苏联各工业企业广泛地展开了社会主义竞赛，争取进一步提高劳动生产率，争取更好地利用现代技术设备。莫斯科的劳动人民今年已经超额出产了许多工作母机、机器、金属、工具和其他产品。目前，他们和全国人民一起胜利地执行着急速增加消费品生产的伟大任务。
    即将在莫斯科开幕的苏联农业展览会的工作人员、季米里雅泽夫农业科学院的教师和学生、农业部和国营农场部的工作人员，拿着花朵、绿枝、苹果树花枝走过红场。从游行者拿着的生产图表牌中可以看出莫斯科各企业和科学机关对农业的巨大帮助。
    红场上响起了歌颂苏联人民的幸福生活及苏联各族人民的友谊的歌声。人们抬着俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰共和国的巨大的国徽模型，两个国徽模型用一条长幅绸子联结在一起，绸子上写着“永远在一起”几个大字，分外引人注目。
    莫斯科人高举着数百面大旗前进，旗帜上面写着号召保卫世界和平和加强各国人民友谊的口号。游行者热烈地向站在观礼台上的外国来宾欢呼。
    游行者举着中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、越南民主共和国的共产党、工人党和政府领袖们的画像。游行者还举着法国、意大利、美国、西班牙、英国、印度、巴西各国共产党领袖的画像。
    莫斯科大学学生的游行队伍走来了。现在在那里学习的有五十九个民族的青年男女，其中有中华人民共和国、朝鲜、保加利亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的青年。往下就是科学家、工程师、作家、建筑工作者、教师等的队伍。他们正在为和平和进步而从事建设性的劳动。
    莫斯科劳动人民的节日游行持续了五小时。这次游行明显地表现出苏联人民、共产党和苏联政府的牢不可破的团结，以及苏联人民对保卫和巩固和平、进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际合作的不可动摇的意志。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
