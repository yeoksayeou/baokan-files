Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 10th: The Geneva Conference continued its discussion on the Indochina issue at 3:00 PM on the 10th. The general debate on the Korean issue did not take place on the 10th. The meeting on the 10th was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.

    Pham Van Dong, chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, first read a statement announcing that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was prepared to allow the transport of seriously wounded personnel of the French Expeditionary Force captured at Dien Bien Phu. If the French government is willing to transport them, representatives of the two commands will take practical measures on the spot to this effect.

    Bao Dai Vietnam representative Nguyen Quoc Dinh then spoke. He said he had a letter for the chairman suggesting that the conference consider the immediate withdrawal of wounded personnel from Dien Bien Phu.

    Chairman Molotov replied that the letter had just been received and was being translated. He only knew the contents of the letter from the representative's speech. Molotov expressed satisfaction with the statement just made by the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that this humanitarian action for the seriously wounded French soldiers would undoubtedly improve their situation and was in accordance with our common wishes. He believed that the relevant authorities would take appropriate measures for this.

    French Foreign Minister Bidault then spoke. He expressed his willingness to accept the proposal of the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, agreeing that the two commands should take necessary measures on the spot in order to implement the task of transporting the seriously wounded personnel of the French Expeditionary Force from Dien Bien Phu.

    Pham Van Dong, chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, then made a general statement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and the restoration of peace in Indochina (full text to be published separately), and put forward concrete suggestions for resolving the Indochina issue.

    Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, put forward the following proposals for the restoration of peace in Indochina:

    (1) France recognizes Vietnam's sovereignty and independence throughout the entire territory of Vietnam, and recognizes the sovereignty and independence of Cambodia and Laos.

    (2) Conclude an agreement stipulating the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territories of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos within a timeframe agreed upon by the warring parties. Before the withdrawal of troops, an agreement should be reached on the concentration points of French troops in Vietnam, paying particular attention to limiting their concentration points to a minimum. It should also be stipulated that French troops shall not interfere in the affairs of the local government in their concentration areas.

    (3) Hold free general elections in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Consultative conferences of representatives of both governments should be held separately in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and a unified government should be established in each of these countries, on the condition of guaranteeing freedom of action for patriotic parties and social organizations to prepare for and hold free general elections, without external interference. Establish local committees to supervise the preparation and conduct of elections.
    
    Before the establishment of the unified governments in the aforementioned countries, the two governments shall exercise their administrative functions separately in those areas under their jurisdiction in accordance with the solutions implemented after the cessation of hostilities agreements.
    
    (4) The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will issue a statement on the willingness of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to study the issue of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam joining the French Union in accordance with the principles of free will and the conditions for joining. The governments of Cambodia and Laos should also issue corresponding statements.
    
    (5) The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as Cambodia and Laos, recognize France's existing economic and cultural interests in these countries.
    
    After the establishment of unified governments in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the economic and cultural relations between these countries and France should be resolved based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Before the establishment of the unified governments in these three countries, the economic and cultural relations between Indochina and France shall temporarily remain unchanged. However, in areas where transportation and trade links have been interrupted, such links may be re-established on the basis of mutual understanding.
    
    Citizens of both sides will enjoy preferential treatment in terms of residence, movement, and business activities in the territory of the other side, which will be determined later.
    
    (6) The warring parties guarantee not to prosecute those who cooperated with the other side during the war.
    
    (7) Implement mutual exchange of prisoners of war.
    
    (8) Before implementing the measures stipulated in items (1) to (7), hostilities in Indochina should first be ceased, and France and each of the three countries should conclude appropriate agreements for this purpose, which should stipulate:
    
    A. All armed forces of the warring parties—ground forces, naval forces, and air forces—shall simultaneously implement a complete ceasefire throughout the entire territory of Indochina. The two sides in the three countries of Indochina should make necessary determinations of the territory and areas they occupy in order to consolidate the ceasefire, and it should be stipulated that neither side shall take obstructive measures when the other side's troops pass through the other's occupied territory for the aforementioned purpose.
    
    B. Completely cease the external transport of new ground forces, naval forces, and air forces or personnel, or any type of weapons and ammunition into Indochina.
    
    C. Establish supervision to supervise the implementation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement, and establish mixed committees composed of representatives of the warring parties in the three countries for this purpose.
    
    Pham Van Dong expressed his belief that the above suggestions would receive the support of the resistance governments and people of Cambodia and Laos.
    
    After Pham Van Dong finished speaking, the chairman announced a fifteen-minute recess. After the resumption of the meeting, Thai Phanh, the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and Phoung Sananikone, the representative of the Kingdom of Laos, then spoke one after another. They closed their eyes and refused to recognize the existence of the Cambodian and Lao resistance governments, which control vast areas and are supported by the people. They completely copied Bidault's rhetoric, slandering the Cambodian and Lao people's movements for national independence as "foreign aggression." They demanded the withdrawal of the non-existent troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from Cambodian and Lao territory, but they completely failed to mention the withdrawal of French troops.
    
    British representative Eden then spoke. Eden acknowledged that Pham Van Dong's speech represented the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people, but he attempted to defend the United States, denying Pham Van Dong's accusations of American interference in the Indochina war. He portrayed the United States as if it were a country that "has never enslaved anyone in the world."
    
    Eden said he did not want to discuss who was right and who was wrong in the past. He believed that the purpose of the meeting was to seek a solution. Eden believed that Bidault's proposal was "realistic," and he requested that Bidault's proposal be used as the basis for discussion. He believed that this proposal was only an outline, and all details could be resolved through negotiations. Eden said: Everyone must face the reality of Indochina, where there is no clear and readily available front line, so a simple ceasefire is quite impractical. Eden advocated making arrangements to separate the opposing forces and withdraw them to clearly defined areas. At the same time, measures agreed upon by both parties must be taken to ensure the stability of the ceasefire and to prevent misunderstandings regarding the above provisions. Eden requested immediate concrete discussion of the above proposals in order to formulate a concrete plan within this week.
    
    American representative Smith then spoke. He could not produce concrete facts and arguments to refute Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's accusations of American interference in Indochina, nor did he express his opinion on the suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He portrayed the well-known American policy of prolonging and expanding the Indochina war as the United States' hope to establish lasting peace in Indochina. He portrayed the United States' attempt to replace France and turn Indochina into its own colony as if the United States wanted the people of Indochina to obtain "independence." Smith believed that a ceasefire agreement must be reached before any agreement can be reached. He demanded that this ceasefire should have effective and sufficient guarantees, especially effective international supervision. He expressed his support for the French representative's proposal. He believed that in addition to this proposal, there should be a political solution. He was unwilling to express his opinion on the section of the French proposal stating that the agreement reached should be guaranteed by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference. However, he suggested that the French proposal be used as the basis for discussion.
    
    Bao Dai Vietnam representative Nguyen Quoc Dinh requested that the withdrawal of wounded personnel among the captured Dien Bien Phu garrison should include wounded personnel of the Bao Dai army. Bidault also stated that this was his understanding when he accepted the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this issue. Chairman Molotov said, I believe that the representatives participating in the meeting have all taken note of the above opinions.
    
    At 6:50 PM, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting.

    日内瓦会议继续讨论印度支那问题
    范文同提出八点具体建议
    据新华社日内瓦十日电：日内瓦会议于十日下午三时继续讨论印度支那问题。关于朝鲜问题的一般辩论十日没有进行。十日的会议由苏联外交部长莫洛托夫担任主席。
    越南民主共和国代表团首席代表、副总理兼代理外交部长范文同首先宣读了一项声明，宣布越南民主共和国政府准备允许运走在奠边府俘获的法国远征军重伤人员。如果法国政府愿意运走他们，双方司令部的代表将对此事就地采取切实的措施。
    保大越南国代表阮国定接着发言。他说他有一封信给主席，信里建议会议考虑不延迟地从奠边府撤退伤员的问题。
    主席莫洛托夫回答说，这封信是刚刚收到的，现在正在翻译。他只是从这位代表的发言中才知道这封信的内容。莫洛托夫对越南民主共和国代表团首席代表刚才的声明表示满意。他说，这种对于法军重伤人员的人道主义的行动，无疑将改善他们的处境，而且是符合于我们的共同愿望的。他相信有关当局会为此采取适当的措施。
    法国外交部长皮杜尔接着发言。他表示愿意接受越南民主共和国代表的建议。同意由双方司令部就地采取必要措施，以便执行从奠边府运走法国远征军重伤人员的任务。
    越南民主共和国代表团首席代表范文同接着就停止印度支那敌对行动及恢复印度支那和平问题作一般性发言（全文另发），并提出了解决印度支那问题的具体建议。
    范文同代表越南民主共和国政府提出关于恢复印度支那和平的建议如下：
    （一）法国承认越南在越南整个领土上的主权与独立，并承认高棉与寮国的主权与独立。
    （二）缔结协定，规定在交战双方同意的时限内，自越南、高棉与寮国领土上撤退一切外国军队。在军队撤退以前，就法国军队在越南的集中地点达成协议，特别注意把他们的集中地点限制到最小限度，还应该规定法国军队不得干涉他们集中地区的当地政府的事务。
    （三）在越南、高棉与寮国举行自由普选。在越南、高棉与寮国国内，分别举行双方政府代表的协商会议，并在保证爱国党派与社会团体有行动自由来筹备并举行自由普选的条件下，在各该国建立一个统一的政府，不允许有外来的干涉。成立地方性的委员会来监督选举的筹备与进行。
    在上述各国的统一政府没有建立以前，双方政府在那些根据停止敌对行动的协定实行了解决办法以后应归其管辖的地区内，分别行使其行政上的职权。
      （四）由越南民主共和国代表团就越南民主共和国政府愿意研究越南民主共和国依照自由意志的原则与加入的条件而加入法兰西联邦的问题发表声明。高棉与寮国政府也应该发表相应的声明。
      （五）越南民主共和国以及高棉与寮国承认法国在这些国家内现存的经济与文化上的利益。
    在越南、高棉与寮国各自的统一政府建立以后，这些国家与法国之间的经济和文化关系，应该根据平等互利的原则解决。在这三个国家的统一政府还没有建立以前，印度支那和法国之间的经济和文化关系暂时维持现状而不加以改变。不过在那些交通与贸易联系已告中断的地区内，得在双方谅解的基础上重新建立这种联系。
    双方公民将享受在另一方领土上居留、移动和事务活动方面的特惠地位，这种地位将在以后决定。
      （六）交战双方保证不对在战争时期和另一方合作的人起诉。
      （七）实行互相交换战俘。
    （八）在执行（一）项至（七）项所规定的措施之前，应该先在印度支那停止敌对行动，并由法国和三国中的各国为这个目的缔结适当的协定，其中应该规定：
    甲、交战双方的一切武装部队——地面部队、海军和空军——在整个印度支那领土上同时实行彻底的停火。印度支那三国中的双方为了巩固停战，应对领土和他们所占领的地区作必要的确定，并且应该规定：双方都不得在另一方军队为了上述目的而通过对方占领的领土时采取阻挠措施。
    乙、完全停止从外面把新的地面部队、海军和空军部队或人员或任何类型的武器和弹药运入印度支那。
    丙、建立监督，以监督停止敌对行动协定条款的执行，并为此目的在三国设立由交战双方代表所组成的混合委员会。
    范文同表示相信上述建议会得到高棉与寮国抗战政府和人民的支持。
      范文同发言完毕，主席宣布休息十五分钟。复会后高棉王国的代表泰普潘和寮国王国的代表冯·萨纳尼空接着相继发言。他们闭上眼睛不承认拥有广大地区和为人民拥护的高棉和寮国抗战政府的存在。他们完全抄袭皮杜尔的论调，把高棉和寮国人民争取民族独立的运动诬蔑成“外国侵略”。他们要求从高棉和寮国境内撤退事实上并不存在的越南民主共和国的军队，然而他们却完全不提撤退法国军队。
    英国代表艾登接着发言。艾登承认范文同的发言是代表了越南人民的民族愿望，但是他却企图替美国辩护，否认范文同对于美国干涉印度支那战争的指责。他把美国说成似乎是一个“从来没有奴役过世界上任何人”的国家。
    艾登说，他不想讨论过去谁是谁非。他认为会议的目的是寻求解决办法。艾登认为皮杜尔的建议是“现实的”，他要求以皮杜尔的建议作为讨论的基础。他认为这个提案只是一个大纲，一切细节可由谈判解决。艾登说：大家必须面对印度支那的现实，在那里并没有一条清楚的现成的战线，因此简单的停火是颇不实际的。艾登主张要有所安排，以隔离敌对双方的部队，并使之撤退到明确划定的地区内。同时必须采取双方协议的措施，以保证停战之稳定并对上项规定不致引起误解。艾登要求立即进入上项建议的具体讨论，以期在本星期内能拟定一项具体计划。
    美国代表史密斯接着发言。他拿不出具体事实和论据来答复范文同代理外长对美国干涉印度支那的指责，他也没有对越南民主共和国的建议表示意见。他把众所周知的美国的旨在延续和扩大印度支那战争的政策，说成是美国希望在印度支那建立持久和平。他把美国力图取法国而代之，把印度支那变为自己的殖民地，说成好像是美国希望印度支那人民获得“独立”。史密斯认为，在达成任何协议之前，必须首先达成一个停战协定。他要求这一停战应有有效和充分的保证，特别是要有有效的国际监督。他表示支持法国代表的提案。他认为除了这个提案之外应有一个政治解决方案。他对于法国建议中提到达成的协议应由参加日内瓦会议的各国予以保证一节，不愿表示意见。但他又建议以法国的提案作为讨论的基础。
    保大越南代表阮国定要求撤退被俘的奠边府守军伤员中应包括保大军队的伤员。皮杜尔也表示他在接受越南民主共和国关于这个问题的建议时也是这样理解的。主席莫洛托夫说，我相信参加会议的代表们都注意到了上述的意见。
    下午六时五十分，主席宣布休会。
