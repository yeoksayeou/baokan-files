Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 11th. The Indonesian newspaper "National Pioneer" published a commentary on the 7th, condemning the US's conspiracy to form a Southeast Asian military bloc. The newspaper pointed out that the primary purpose of the United States in organizing a Southeast Asian military alliance is to protect the huge interests of imperialist countries in Southeast Asia. The newspaper said: "The security of a region that has been reduced to a Western colony and provides its rulers with profits worth billions of pesos (currency name) is now considered threatened." For this "security," Western countries are attempting to establish a "common defense organization."

The newspaper pointed out: "The Southeast Asian Defense Alliance will be regarded as an activity aimed at maintaining the colonial system. This activity is clearly contrary to basic human rights and threatens world peace."

    斥美国拼凑东南亚军事集团
    【新华社雅加达十一日电】印度尼西亚“民族先锋报”七日发表评论，谴责美国拼凑东南亚军事集团的阴谋。该报指出，美国组织东南亚军事联盟的首要目的是保护帝国主义国家在东南亚的巨大利益。该报说：“已沦为西方的殖民地并为其统治者提供价值亿万披阿士特（币名）利润的地区的安全，现在被认为受到了威胁。”为了这种“安全”，西方国家企图建立“共同防御组织”。
    该报指出：“东南亚防御联盟将被认为是一种旨在保持殖民制度的活动。这种活动显然是和基本人权相抵触的，并威胁着世界和平。”
