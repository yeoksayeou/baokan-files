    The Fuxin Mining Bureau's Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine is continuing capital construction at an accelerated pace. This year, the state's investment in capital construction for the open-pit mine greatly exceeds that of last year. The main projects include four machinery repair factories used to maintain and repair the mine's electric locomotives, vehicles, and machinery; a substation serving as the mine's total power source; a coal storage bin known as the throat of the open-pit mine; eighteen bridges and culverts; and the laying of railways, erection of high-voltage power lines, and erection of iron towers. Upon completion of these projects, the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine will reach its designed production capacity. The coal produced in one year, if supplied to power plants, can generate enough electricity to smelt 36.75 million tons of steel.
    After the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine went into production on July 1, last year, it was originally planned to reach its designed production capacity by 1956. In order to supply a large amount of coal for national economic construction, the workers decided to accelerate construction and strive to reach the designed production capacity next year. Since the start of various projects in January, 27.08 percent of the annual plan has been completed by early May. At present, 25 kilometers of new lines have been added to the intricate railway trunk lines within the mining area, and rows of silver-white iron towers have been erected on both sides of some lines. Several soil discharge lines on the periphery of the mining area are extending in different directions. On the substation construction site, more than a dozen types of workers are working simultaneously, and the factory buildings have already been built.

    The installation of machinery at the Northwest Third State-Owned Cotton Mill has basically been completed. The quality of the project is higher than the installation standards of the previous newly built cotton mills in the Northwest.
    Since May 10th, the installed machines have been put into trial production one after another. The machines run smoothly and flexibly, and the product quality is good. Raw cotton is turned into uniformly thick cotton rolls by the opener and scutcher, and then spun into very even 23-count yarn by the drawing frame, roving frame, and spinning frame. After testing, the yarn's tensile strength reaches about 85 pounds. Under natural temperature and humidity, the end breakage rate of the spinning frame is only about 85 ends per thousand spindles per hour. The quality of the cloth produced by the weaving workshop, among other things, has exceeded the trial production level of newly built cotton mills in the Northwest region in the past.
    During the installation process, each workshop established a quality inspection team to inspect the installation according to the prescribed quality standards. The installation workers worked very carefully. The bending degree of the rollers, an important component of the spinning frame, is specified not to exceed three thousandths of an inch. The workers repeatedly measured it with precise micrometers. If they found a slight difference, they immediately corrected it until the pointer on the micrometer stabilized.
    At present, the factory is stepping up preparations for officially putting into production. More than two thousand apprentice workers who have been learning in six cotton mills in Xi'an, Xianyang, and Baoji are returning to the factory one after another to participate in production.

### 阜新海州露天煤矿加速进行基本建设  国营西北第三棉纺织厂开始试车生产

    阜新海州露天煤矿加速进行基本建设
    国营西北第三棉纺织厂开始试车生产
    阜新矿务局海州露天煤矿正在继续进行基本建设。今年国家给露天矿的基本建设投资超过去年很多，主要工程有用以维护和修配全矿电机车、车辆、机械的四个机械修配厂，作为全矿总电源的变电所，被称为露天矿咽喉的贮煤仓，十八座桥梁、涵洞和铺设铁道、架设高压电线、竖立铁塔等。这些工程建成后，海州露天煤矿生产将达到设计产量。一年产的煤，如供给发电厂，可发出足够炼三千六百七十五万吨钢所需的电力。
    海州露天煤矿在去年七月一日投入生产后，原计划到一九五六年达到设计产量。职工们为供应国家经济建设大量煤炭，决定加速进行建设，争取在明年达到设计产量。各项工程从一月份先后开工以来，到五月上旬已完成全年计划的百分之二十七点零八。目前，在矿区错综往来的铁路干线中，又增设了二十五公里新线路，有的线路两旁已经竖立起一排排银白色的铁塔，矿区外围几条排土线路正在分头向前伸延。变电所工地上，十多个工种正在同时施工，厂房也已经盖好。

    国营西北第三棉纺织厂的机器安装工程已基本结束。工程质量比西北过去几个新建棉纺织厂的安装标准都高。
    自五月十日起，已经安装好的机器就陆续试车生产。机器运转轻便灵活，产品质量良好。原棉经过清花机，变成了厚薄均匀的棉花卷，再经过并条机、粗纱机、细纱机，就纺出了很均匀的二十三支纱。经过试验，纱的拉力达到八十五磅左右。在天然温湿度下的细纱断头，每千锭每小时只有八十五根左右。连布场生产布匹的质量在内，都超过了西北区从前新建棉纺织厂的试车生产水平。
    在安装过程中，每个车间都成立了质量检查小组，依据规定的质量标准随装随检查。安装工人们都十分细心地工作。细纱机上的重要部件罗拉，颈弯程度规定不能超过千分之三吋，工人们拿着精密准确的千分表反复地测定，发现有一丝之差，就马上进行矫正，直到千分表上的指针稳定了为止。
    目前这个厂正在加紧进行正式投入生产的各种准备工作。在西安、咸阳、宝鸡等地的六个棉纺织厂中学习的两千多个养成工，正陆续回到本厂来参加生产。　（新华社）
