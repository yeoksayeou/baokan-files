The first People's Congress of the Ningxia Mongolian Autonomous Region was held in Bayanhot from April 19th to 23rd. Seventy-two representatives of Mongolian, Han, and Hui nationalities attended the congress. Sun Diancai, Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, and others went to offer congratulations. The congress elected Dali Zaya (Mongolian) as Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, Yun Xiangsheng (Mongolian), Chen Aierdeni Batu (Mongolian), and Yang Lisheng (Han) as Vice Chairmen, and Duan Batu (Mongolian), Liu Sixiao (Han), Ma Weirong (Hui), and twenty-one others as members, formally establishing the People's Government of the Ningxia Mongolian Autonomous Region.

The congress discussed and approved the summary of the preparatory work of the Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee over the past five months, the report on the guiding principles and tasks for the Autonomous Region's future work, and the report on the Autonomous Region's 1954 fiscal budget. The congress decided that the main tasks of the Autonomous Region in the future are: under the guidance of the general task of the country during the transition period, to cooperate with the country's industrialization construction, vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production on the basis of consolidating national unity, continue to strengthen trade, culture, education, medical care, health and other work, and gradually improve people's lives. The congress believes that to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production in the autonomous region, it is necessary to continue to implement the policies of "no division, no struggle, no class division" and "mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdowners" in pastoral areas; in agricultural areas, mutual aid and cooperation organizations should be vigorously developed to increase grain production. While developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, attention must be paid to organizing mutual support between industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. In the Alxa Banner within the Autonomous Region, the focus should be on developing animal husbandry production; in Dengkou County, the focus should be on developing agricultural production; in areas suitable for both agricultural and animal husbandry development, the area of farmland and pasture should be fixed, and agricultural and animal husbandry production should be developed separately.

In order to develop various construction undertakings in the Autonomous Region, the congress resolved that national unity should be further strengthened, and people and cadres of all ethnic groups should be educated to respect and learn from each other, and to strengthen the education of patriotism and internationalism among the people of all ethnic groups. Major and minor issues existing between or within ethnic groups should be handled through democratic consultation in the spirit of national equality and unity, based on the principle of benefiting unity and production. People of all ethnic groups should be vigilant at all times to expose and combat the conspiracies and activities of counter-revolutionaries to undermine national unity.

The congress also adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency: The Ningxia Mongolian Autonomous Region is an autonomous region equivalent to a special district level, including the pastoral area of Alxa Banner (formerly the Alxa Banner Mongolian Autonomous Region) and the agricultural area of Dengkou County. The total area of the region is 120,000 square kilometers, and it is inhabited by more than 60,000 people of Mongolian, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups, of which the Mongolian population accounts for 30%. The Alxa Banner has vast grasslands suitable for large-scale development of livestock. In the four years since liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the superior people's government, the number of livestock in Alxa Banner has increased to 610,000, nearly doubling the number at the time of initial liberation. Due to the vigorous construction of sand prevention and bank protection forests and the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Dengkou County, the average yield per mu of the county's 172,000 mu of cultivated land has increased from more than 90 jin at the time of liberation to the current 148 jin. The unity among and within the various ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region has also been strengthened day by day.

    宁夏省蒙古自治区人民政府成立
    宁夏省蒙古自治区首届人民代表大会四月十九日到二十三日在巴音浩特举行。出席大会的有蒙、汉、回等族代表七十二人。前往祝贺的有宁夏省人民政府副主席孙殿才等。大会选出达理札雅（蒙族）为自治区人民政府主席，云祥生（蒙族）、陈爱尔德尼巴图（蒙族）、杨力生（汉族）为副主席，段巴图（蒙族）、刘思孝（汉族）、马维荣（回族）等二十三人为委员，正式成立了宁夏省蒙古自治区人民政府。
    大会讨论并通过了自治区筹备委员会五个月来的筹备工作总结和自治区今后工作方针任务的报告，以及关于自治区一九五四年财政预算的报告。大会决定自治区今后的主要任务是：在国家过渡时期总任务的照耀下，配合国家工业化的建设，在巩固民族团结的基础上，大力发展农牧业生产，继续加强贸易、文教、医疗、卫生等工作，并逐步改善人民生活。大会认为要发展自治区的农牧业生产，必须在牧业区继续贯彻“不分不斗，不划阶级”和
  “牧工、牧主两利”政策；在农业区应大力发展互助合作组织，增产粮食。在发展农牧业生产同时，必须注意组织工、农、牧业的相互支援。在自治区内的阿拉善旗应以发展畜牧业生产为主；在磴口县应以发展农业生产为主；在发展农牧业生产都适宜的地区，应固定农田、牧场面积，分别发展农业和畜牧业生产。
    为了发展自治区各项建设事业，大会决议应进一步加强民族团结，教育各族人民和干部互相尊重，互相学习，并加强对各族人民的爱国主义与国际主义思想的教育。对于民族之间或民族内部存在的大小问题，应本民族平等团结精神，在有利于团结生产的原则下，民主协商处理。各族人民应随时提高警惕，揭露和打击反革命分子破坏民族团结的阴谋和活动。
    大会并通过了给毛主席的致敬电文。
    宁夏省蒙古自治区是相当于专区级的自治区，包括牧业区阿拉善旗（即原阿拉善旗蒙族自治区）和农业区磴口县。全区面积十二万平方公里，居住着蒙、回、汉等族人民六万多人，其中蒙族人口占百分之三十。阿拉善旗草原辽阔，适宜大量发展牧畜。解放四年来，在中国共产党和上级人民政府的领导和帮助下，阿拉善旗的各种牲畜已发展到六十一万头，比初解放时增加近一倍。磴口县由于大力营造防沙护岸林和发展农业互助合作组织，全县十七万二千亩耕地已从解放时每亩平均产量九十多斤提高到现在的一百四十八斤。自治区内各民族间和民族内部的团结也日益加强。　（新华社）
