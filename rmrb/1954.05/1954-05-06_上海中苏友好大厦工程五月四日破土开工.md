    Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building Project Breaks Ground on May 4th
    [This newspaper Shanghai 5th dispatch] The grand Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building construction project held its groundbreaking ceremony on May 4th. Shanghai Deputy Mayor Pan Hannian and Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Shitley, and more than 1,400 others attended the ceremony.
    The Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building is being built in the center of Shanghai, between Yan'an Middle Road and Nanjing West Road, within the former "Hardoon Garden." It covers an area of over 95,000 square meters, with the building itself having a base area of over 17,000 square meters and a volume of over 240,000 cubic meters. This building was designed in the Soviet national style by the famous Soviet architect and Stalin Prize winner Andreyev, engineer and Stalin Prize winner Kokhman, and architect Gisnova. Entering from the main entrance of the building, there is a wide cement floor and a huge fountain. There are two long corridors on both sides of the cement floor, with beautiful gardens on both sides of the corridors. Passing through the cement floor is the central building, with a golden spire on top, reaching a height of 102 meters from the ground. It will be the highest point of all buildings in Shanghai, and the spire will be decorated with a huge, radiant red star. Once the entire project is completed, the Soviet Union will hold an exhibition here on the great achievements of the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction. This will be of great significance to our country in further learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and to enhancing the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.
    After the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building project broke ground, more than 300 outstanding Youth League members in Shanghai participated in voluntary labor. Ding Shengya, a representative of the workers participating in the construction of this project, said: We will resolutely implement the spirit of "a project of the century, quality first," and strive to achieve "good, fast, economical, and safe" in our work, and ensure the completion of the task on schedule.

    上海中苏友好大厦工程五月四日破土开工
    【本报上海五日电】规模宏大的上海中苏友好大厦建筑工程，已在五月四日举行开工典礼。上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年和苏联驻上海总领事施捷利等一千四百多人参加了典礼。
    上海中苏友好大厦是建筑在上海市中心地带延安中路与南京西路之间，原“哈同花园”内，它的面积有九万五千多平方公尺，建筑物本身基地面积是一万七千多平方公尺，体积是二十四万多立方公尺。这座大厦是由苏联著名的建筑师、斯大林奖金获得者安德烈耶夫，工程师、斯大林奖金获得者郭赫曼和建筑师吉斯诺娃等按苏联民族形式设计的。这座大厦，从正门进入，是一块宽大的水泥地坪和巨大的喷水池，水泥地坪两旁有两个长廊，长廊两边有美丽的庭园，经过水泥地坪就是中央大楼，中央大楼上是金色的尖塔，塔顶离地高达一百零二公尺，它将是全上海建筑物的最高点，塔尖将装饰一颗光芒四射的巨大的红星。全部工程完成后，苏联将在这里举办关于苏联在经济和文化建设上的伟大成就的展览会。这对于我国进一步学习苏联先进经验，对于增强中苏两国人民的友谊，都将会有着很大的意义。
    上海中苏友好大厦工程破土开工后，上海市三百多名优秀的青年团员参加义务劳动。参加这一工程建设的工人代表丁盛雅表示：坚决贯彻“百年大计，质量第一”的精神，在工作中做到“好、快、省、安全”，并保证按期完成任务。
