    Educate Drivers and the Public to Value Traffic Safety
    Wuhan Sentences a Batch of Traffic Violation Cases
    In order to educate drivers and the public to truly value traffic safety and avoid and reduce traffic accidents, the Qiaokou and Jianghan District People's Courts of Wuhan City recently sentenced a batch of cases involving serious traffic accidents caused by violations of traffic rules.
    Since the beginning of spring this year, Wuhan City has experienced a series of major traffic accidents. According to statistics from the city's Public Security Bureau, a total of 294 traffic accidents occurred from January to March, resulting in 13 deaths and 192 injuries. March was the most serious month, with 30 traffic accidents of varying degrees occurring from March 1st to March 25th, resulting in 15 serious injuries and 8 deaths (7 of whom were children aged three to nine). The reasons for the above traffic accidents are twofold: first, relevant agencies, organizations, and enterprises neglect traffic safety and lack management and education of drivers and inspection of vehicles on weekdays, resulting in drivers frequently violating traffic rules, speeding, or having mechanical failures at critical moments that prevent them from controlling the vehicle; second, parents do not strictly supervise their children, allowing them to play on the streets or failing to take care when crossing the road. The head of the No. 1 Private Automobile Station in the city has consistently failed to value traffic safety, not only lacking education for drivers on weekdays but also failing to promptly stop drivers from violating traffic rules even when they knew about it. For example, the station's driver Zhang Dewen had caused multiple accidents because he liked to show off by driving fast, but this did not attract the attention of the station's负责人 [responsible person]. On March 12th, Zhang Dewen was driving an empty car speeding along Zhongshan Avenue. When the car reached the upper end of Guanyinge, a public bus going downhill was stopping on the left to pick up and drop off passengers, and there were four flatbed carts going downhill on the outside of the public bus. The car driven by Zhang Dewen was coming from the opposite direction and did not slow down. It was only when it approached the flatbed carts that he braked suddenly, but because the car's brakes were unbalanced and the steering wheel was not flexible enough, it continued to slide forward after braking, killing flatbed cart worker Xiong Zhengxi on the spot and seriously injuring worker Zhou Chonghua and slightly injuring Liu Wenbo. After this unfortunate incident, the person in charge of the No. 1 Private Automobile Station did not seriously learn a lesson from it, so six days later, another major accident occurred due to the station's drivers violating regulations, resulting in a death. The route from Qiaokou Road to Aijiazui in Wuhan is a one-way street, the road surface is narrow, and it has been in disrepair for many years, and the city's Public Security Bureau has long prohibited driving on it. However, the person in charge of the No. 1 Private Automobile Station, proceeding from a one-sided profit-making perspective, completely disregarded the city's Public Security Bureau's ban and, on March 18th, assigned the station's driver Gao Xiaowen and his assistant Li Mingyi to drive from Qiaokou to Aijiazui to load goods. During the driving, due to the assistant's incorrect instructions, the three-year-old child Chen Bajin was grazed and killed.
    In order to further improve the city's traffic management work, ensure people's traffic safety, and facilitate urban transportation, the Wuhan City Public Security Bureau, in addition to taking measures to strengthen traffic safety publicity for cadres, the masses, and drivers, and continue to remove obstacles affecting traffic, has requested the city's People's Court to give appropriate punishment to those responsible for causing major accidents in violation of traffic rules. The Qiaokou and Jianghan District People's Courts of Wuhan City, after verifying the true facts, have recently sentenced a batch of traffic accident cases. Among them, driver Zhang Dewen was sentenced to three years in prison, and Li Mingyi was sentenced to six months in prison with a one-year reprieve. In addition, the No. 1 Private Automobile Station was ordered to pay for the funeral expenses, medical expenses, and living expenses for the deceased and injured. In addition, in order to urge various agencies, organizations, and enterprises to strengthen the management and education of drivers and the inspection of vehicles, the Qiaokou District Court also decided to give the person in charge of the No. 1 Private Automobile Station a warning.

    教育驾驶人员和群众重视交通安全
    武汉市判决一批违反交通规则案件
    为了教育驾驶人员和人民群众切实重视交通安全，避免和减少交通事故，武汉市礄口、江汉两区人民法院于最近判决了一批违反交通规则造成严重交通事故的案件。
    今年入春以来，武汉市连续发生重大交通事故。据该市公安局统计，一月到三月共发生交通事故二百九十四起，死十三人，伤一百九十二人，其中以三月份最为严重，在三月一日到二十五日便发生了大小交通事故三十起，重伤十五人，死八人（内有七人是三岁到九岁的小孩）。造成上述交通事故的原因，一个是有关机关、团体和企业部门忽视交通安全，平日缺乏对驾驶人员的管理教育和对车辆的检查，因而驾驶人员经常违反交通规则，超速行驶，或在紧急关头机件失灵，不能控制；另一个是家长对儿童的管教不严，听任小孩在马路上玩耍，或在横穿马路时缺乏照管。该市民营汽车第一站的负责人一贯不重视行车安全，不仅平日对司机缺乏教育，而且明知司机有违反交通规则的行为也不及时制止。如该站司机张德文就曾因开车时喜爱开快车来出风头而多次肇事，但并未引起该站负责人的注意。三月十二日，张德文驾驶一辆空车顺中山大道超速行驶。车到观音阁上首时，左侧有下行的公用汽车正靠站上下乘客，公用汽车的外侧有四辆板车下行，张德文所驾驶的汽车从对面开来，并未降低速度，直到接近板车时才紧急刹车，但因该汽车的制动机不平衡，方向盘不够灵活，在刹车后仍继续前滑，因而当场将板车工人熊正喜轧死，工人周重华受重伤，刘文波受轻伤。这一不幸事件发生后，民营汽车第一站的负责人并未认真地从中吸取教训，因而在六天以后又发生了该站的司机人员违反规定造成人身死亡的重大事故。从武汉市的礄口路到艾家咀是单行线路，路面狭窄，年久失修，早为该市公安局明令禁止行车。但民营汽车第一站的负责人却从片面营利观点出发，毫不重视市公安局的禁令，在三月十八日指派该站司机高筱文及其助手李明义从礄口开车到艾家咀装货。在行车时，因助手的指挥错误，将道旁的三岁小孩陈八斤擦伤致死。
    为了进一步改善城市的交通管理工作，以保障人民的交通安全，便利城市的交通运输，武汉市公安局除已采取措施，加强对于干部、群众和司机人员的交通安全的宣传，继续清除影响交通的障碍物等外，已提请该市人民法院给予违反交通规则造成重大事故的肇事人员以适当处分。武汉市礄口、江汉两区人民法院在查明事实真象后，已在日前分别判决了一批交通事故案件。其中如司机张德文被判处三年徒刑，李明义被判处徒刑半年缓期一年执行外，并责成民营汽车第一站付给死者、伤者安葬费、医药费及抚养费。此外礄口区法院为了督促各机关、团体、企业部门等加强对驾驶人员的管理教育和对车辆的检验，还决定给予民营汽车第一站负责人以警告处分。
