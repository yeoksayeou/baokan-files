Central National Defense Sports Club Holds Weekend Camping

In order to carry out summer national defense sports activities and promote people's health, the Central National Defense Sports Club began holding weekend camping on the 23rd in the scenic area near the capital - the Ming Tombs. Thousands of young men and women, workers, young cadres, advanced producers, and model workers will come here to spend the weekend.

The activities of the weekend camping include collective mountain climbing, live ammunition shooting with small-bore sporting rifles, visiting the Ming Tombs, picnics, and evening parties.

The camp is located near the Tailing Tomb in the Ming Tombs. It is surrounded by green mountains, and a clear stream flows from the valley. Near the Jishui Spring in the west of the tomb, there is a lush forest of evergreen pines and cypresses and dense orchards. More than seventy different styles of campsites are neatly arranged in the forest. Here, about five hundred people can camp each time.

Those participating in the first, second, third, and fourth phases of weekend camping are working cadres from various units directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Now, they are using their spare time to practice collective dance and singing and other entertainment programs.

    中央国防体育俱乐部举办周末野营
    为开展夏季国防体育活动，增进人民的健康，中央国防体育俱乐部自二十三日开始在首都附近的风景区——明十三陵举办周末野营。成千的男女青年、工人、青年干部、先进生产者和工作模范，将到这里来度过周末。
    周末野营的活动内容有集体爬山、小口径运动枪实弹射击、游览明十三陵、野餐和晚会等。
    营地设在明十三陵中的泰陵附近。这里青山环抱，一股清澈见底的小溪从溪谷中流出。陵西的汲水泉附近，是一片苍松翠柏和茂密的果林，林间整齐地排列着七十多座不同式样的营幕。这里，每次可以容纳五百人左右宿营。
