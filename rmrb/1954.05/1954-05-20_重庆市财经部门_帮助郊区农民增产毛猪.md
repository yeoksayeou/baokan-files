    Chongqing Municipal Finance Department
    Helps Suburban Farmers Increase Hog Production
    Chongqing's financial and economic departments are actively taking effective measures to support suburban farmers in increasing hog production.
    With the improvement of people's living standards, the sales volume of pork in Chongqing has been continuously increasing. The pork sales volume in 1953 increased by 210 percent compared to 1951. At the same time, since most of the hogs consumed in Chongqing are transported from rural areas of nearby counties, sometimes there is a shortage of supply during the busy farming season. In order to meet the needs of citizens and increase the sideline income of suburban farmers, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the financial and economic departments to actively help suburban farmers increase hog production, requiring a one-third increase in production this year compared to last year, and to maintain a consistent stock of 200,000 hogs. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government has decided to allocate 30 million jin of miscellaneous grains as pig feed, and 4 million jin have already been allocated. The agricultural and forestry departments are mobilizing farmers to use vacant land to plant pig grass and collect wild plants to feed pigs. The Chongqing Food Company of the China Food Company is placing orders for hogs with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the suburbs and will provide farmers with a portion of miscellaneous grains to help solve the difficulty of insufficient feed.
    At present, state-owned farms, orchards, and forest farms in Chongqing have included hog raising in their production plans. Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and the vast number of farmers in the suburbs have also begun to increase hog raising.

    重庆市财经部门
    帮助郊区农民增产毛猪
    重庆市财经部门积极采取有效措施，支持郊区农民增产毛猪。
    随着人民生活水平的提高，重庆市猪肉销售量不断增加。一九五三年猪肉销售量，比一九五一年增加百分之二百一十。同时，由于重庆市食用的毛猪大部分是由附近各县农村运来，农忙季节，有时便发生供应不足的现象。为了满足市民需要和增加郊区农民的副业收入，中共重庆市委会指示财经部门积极帮助郊区农民增产毛猪，要求今年比去年增产三分之一，并经常保持有二十万头猪。重庆市人民政府财政经济委员会决定调拨三千万斤杂粮，作为养猪饲料，现在已调拨四百万斤。农林部门正动员农民利用空地种植猪草，采集野生植物喂猪。中国食品公司重庆市食品公司正在向郊区各农业生产合作社、互助组订购毛猪，并将供给农民一部分杂粮，帮助解决饲料不足的困难。
    目前，重庆市国营农场、果园、林场已将饲养毛猪列入生产计划。郊区农业生产合作社、互助组和广大农民也开始增养毛猪。
