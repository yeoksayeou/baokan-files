Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. In the first half of May, the US side continued to violate the Armistice Agreement by constantly dispatching armed personnel to invade the Korean-Chinese side area to carry out hostile activities.
    On May 6th, our army stationed on the Yan'an Peninsula captured Bai Guangxuan, an armed agent sent by the US side to spy on military intelligence. According to Bai Guangxuan's confession, he was a member of the Pae-yon Island First Detachment of the US Air Force Intelligence Agency. At around 17:00 on May 4th, Jin Ji, the adjutant of the detachment, ordered him to sneak into the Korean-Chinese side area to collect military intelligence. Bai Guangxuan set off from Pae-yon Island by sailboat at around 14:00 on May 5th, and was captured by our army after sneaking into our area on May 6th. Bai Guangxuan was carrying four instructions issued by the US side for carrying out hostile activities in our area, a carbine, sixty rounds of ammunition, and a grenade.
    On May 13th, our army captured Jin Mingzhe, an armed agent sent by the US side, northwest of Goseong on the east coast. On the same day, an armed agent, Jin Shanhao, was shot dead west of Goseong. At 16:30 on the 14th, Qian Yunxue (alias Li Zhongtian), another armed agent, was captured west of Goseong. According to Jin Mingzhe and Qian Yunxue, they and the killed agent Jin Shanhao belonged to the MIAK unit of the US intelligence agency. The three of them received the task on the 6th to come to the Korean-Chinese side area to spy on military intelligence. On the same day, they landed on the coast north of Goseong and sneaked into our area. On the 7th, they scattered and fled when they were discovered and pursued by our army, and were later captured or killed by our army on the 13th and 14th. These three agents carried three US-made pistols, a radio, a compass, and various forged documents.
    There were also five other incidents of US armed agents invading our area to carry out hostile activities: On May 3rd, our army captured He Jishun, a female agent sent by the US intelligence agency on Gyodong Island to spy on military intelligence, near Maxiangdong on the Yan'an Peninsula. On May 4th, our army captured Jin Shida and Jin Xinkui, agents sent by the Baicun Detachment of the Rhee army's 207th Intelligence Unit, northwest of Goseong on the east coast. On May 5th, our army captured Li Hachun, an agent sent by the HID of the Rhee army's intelligence unit, southeast of Yan'an. On May 6th, civilian police in our demilitarized zone on the east coast captured Jin Xiangshe, An Chenggui, and Jin Zhouyu, three agents sent by the US side, near Jiuxian Peak. According to the three agents, they were all members of the "US Army Communist Suppression Death Squad" (XIU unit) of the US intelligence agency. They set off from Sokcho-ri by boat on May 5th, landed southeast of Goseong, and sneaked into our area to spy on military intelligence. On May 11th, our army captured Zhang Qianzhen, an agent sent by the 8097 unit of the Far East US Military Command Intelligence Office, on Yiqu Island southeast of Yan'an.
