    Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau Develops Hydrological Survey and Research Work
    In coordination with national construction, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau is actively carrying out hydrological survey and research work.
    In 1953, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau established a hydrological data room dedicated to serving national construction factories and mines. It conducts construction work related to hydrological data such as surface water, river flooding, hydrogeology, meteorology, groundwater, and topographic maps. By mid-May of this year, it had provided hydrological construction data for twenty large factory sites, including the chemical factory under construction in Taiyuan, as well as the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, Shanxi Heavy Machinery Plant, and the expanded and renovated Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and Cement Plant. It also supplied a portion of hydrological data to basic construction units in industry, transportation, and railways, playing a certain role in ensuring the safety and water supply of new factory and mine sites. Currently, in order to further prepare more hydrological construction data for national industry, agriculture, transportation, and water conservancy, the bureau has appropriately relocated the originally established station positions and added new hydrological stations based on the original hydrological stations, water level stations, and rainfall stations from 1953. Now, the province has 27 hydrological stations, 10 water level stations, and 160 technical cadres working in the largest Fen River, Hutuo River, and Sanggan River regions. In addition, there are 105 rainfall stations commissioned to relevant farms, organizations, schools, etc. on behalf of the bureau. Basically, there is a station in every county.

    山西省水利局发展水文调查研究工作
    山西省水利局配合国家建设，积极开展水文调查研究工作。
    山西省水利局在一九五三年成立了一个水文资料室，专为国家建设厂矿服务，进行地面水、河流泛滥、水文地质、气象、地下水、地形图表等有关水文资料的建设工作，到今年五月中旬，已供给了太原市正在筹建的化学工厂以及经纬纺织机械制造厂、山西重型机器厂，扩建和改建的太原钢铁厂，水泥厂等二十座大型厂址的水文建设资料，并给工业交通铁路等基本建设单位供给了一部分水文资料，对保证新建厂矿地址的安全和供水方面起了一定的作用。目前为了进一步给国家准备更多的工业、农业、交通、水利的水文建设资料，又在一九五三年原有水文站、水位站、雨量站的基础上，适当地迁移了原设站位置，并增建了水文站。现在全省已有水文站二十七处，水位站十处，技术干部一百六十人，在全省最大的汾河、滹沱河、桑乾河各地工作。此外委托给各有关农场、机关、学校等代办的雨量站，还有一百零五处。基本上做到了每县有一个站。
