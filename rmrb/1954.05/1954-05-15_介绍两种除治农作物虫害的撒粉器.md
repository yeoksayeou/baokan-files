    In order to meet the needs of rural areas in controlling crop pests, especially wheat midges, the Preparatory Office of the Northwest Institute of Agricultural Sciences and the Wugong Technical Guidance Station improved the sedan-type powder duster (also called the airplane-type powder duster), originally created by farmer Li Zuoxian and others in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, into single-person and double-person powder dusters this spring. After testing, the results are very good. These two types of powder dusters are more labor-saving, have a larger powder output, and cover a larger area than the original sedan-type powder duster. In particular, the single-person powder duster can be used by one person and is extremely convenient to operate in the field. In the situation where mechanically manufactured powder sprayers cannot be supplied in large quantities, such powder dusters play a significant role in the fight against pests in the vast rural areas. The manufacturing and usage methods of the two types of powder dusters are as follows:

    I. The single-person powder duster is made by sewing four cloth bags, each one foot long and eight to nine inches wide. The bag openings have drawstrings that can be pulled from both sides, and each of the two bottom corners of the bag are folded and sewn with a thin rope. Use two bamboo poles, one as the main pole and the other as the auxiliary pole. Tie the four medicine bags to both sides of the main pole, with a distance of two and a half feet between the two middle bags, and a distance of one and a half feet between the two side bags and the middle bags. First, tightly tie half of the bag opening drawstring to the main pole, leaving the other half to be pulled to open the bag opening for filling with powder. Tie the two bottom ropes of the bag tightly to the auxiliary pole to stretch the bag. Finally, tie a rope loop in the middle of the main pole. When using, fill each bag with one jin of "666" powder, tie the bag opening tightly, hang the rope loop in the middle of the main pole around the person's neck, then place both arms on the main pole in front of the chest, pick up the auxiliary pole with both hands and shake it up and down, and the powder will be evenly spread. With this powder duster, one person can spread powder over two to three mu of land per hour.

    II. The double-person powder duster uses six single-person powder dusters. Tie them evenly (at a distance of one and a half feet) in the middle of two nine-foot-long bamboo poles. Additionally, tie two six-foot-long bamboo poles to the middle of the main poles as lifting poles, and tie two rope loops to each end of the lifting poles, so that the auxiliary pole is tilted forward and suspended above the lifting poles. Then, tie two four-foot-long bamboo poles to the auxiliary poles as operating rods. When using, the front and rear people lift up the powder duster, and the person in the back holds the operating rod and shakes it back and forth, and the powder will be evenly spread. To adapt to crops of different heights, the rope loop can be shortened or lengthened, and it can be lifted on the shoulders or suspended around the waist, so as to adjust the height of the powder duster at will. This powder duster can spread powder over three to four mu of land per hour. (Attached pictures)

    介绍两种除治农作物虫害的撒粉器
    西北农业科学研究所筹备处
    西北农业科学研究所筹备处和武功技术指导站，为了适应农村除治农作物虫害，特别是小麦吸浆虫的需要，在今年春季把原来陕西省长安县农民李作贤等创制的轿式撒粉器（也叫飞机式撒粉器），改进为单人撒粉器和双人撒粉器；经过试验，效果很好。这两种撒粉器比原轿式撒粉器省力、出粉量大、撒粉面积大。特别是单人撒粉器，一个人就能使用，在田间行走操作极为方便。在机器制造的喷粉器还不能大量供应的情况下，这样的撒粉器对于广大农村与虫害作斗争有很大的作用。两种撒粉器的制造、使用方法如下：
    一、单人撒粉器是用布缝制成长一尺宽八寸到九寸的药袋四只，袋口穿着可以两边抽动的绳索，袋底两角摺叠各缝入细绳一根。用竹竿两根，一根作主杆，另一根作副杆。把四只药袋分别系在主杆的两边，中间两袋相距二尺五寸，两边两袋各距中间袋为一尺五寸。先把袋口绳索的一半紧绑在主杆上，另一半留作拉动用，以便把袋口撑开，装入药粉。袋底两绳把袋伸展分别绑紧在副杆上。最后在主杆中间系一绳套。使用时每袋装入“六六六”药粉一斤，把袋口束牢，再把主杆中间的绳套挂在人的脖子上，然后双臂放在胸前的主杆上，两手拿起副杆上下振动，药粉即可均匀撒出。用这个撒粉器，一人一小时可撒布二、三亩地。
    二、双人撒粉器是用单人撒粉器六只。把它均等地（距离一尺五寸）系在两根九尺长的竹杆中间。另外把两根六尺长的竹竿绑在主杆中间为抬杆，抬杆两端分别系上两根绳套，使副杆向前倾斜悬吊在抬杆上边，再把两根四尺长的竹竿绑系在副杆上作为操纵杆。使用时，前后两人把撒粉器架起，后边的人持操纵杆前后摇动，药粉即可均匀撒出。为适应不同高度的作物，可把套绳缩短或加长，可以抬在肩上或悬垂腰间，随意调节撒粉器的高度。这个撒粉器每小时可撒布三、四亩地。（附图片）
