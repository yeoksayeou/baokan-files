Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 20th (Dispatch from our Special Correspondent Shen Jiantu): Regarding the secret meeting on Indochina at the Geneva Conference on the 19th, Western news agencies and newspaper reporters continue to obtain information about the meeting from their sources, even though, according to the agreement, this information should not be disclosed. Journalists from some Southeast Asian countries who are unable to obtain inside information about the meeting complain that certain Western delegations have not complied with the agreement on the confidentiality of the meeting. They cite the example of French delegation members coming out every so often during the meeting to tell French journalists what they considered necessary to disclose. Immediately after the meeting, French delegation members held similar conversations with journalists.

According to reports, the meeting on the 19th discussed whether the issues of Cambodia and Laos should be dealt with separately from the issue of Vietnam.

Some Western news agencies and newspapers portray the two-day debate on this issue as being caused by the "Communist side." Obviously, this statement is not in accordance with the facts. An Associated Press (AP) news item on the 20th also acknowledged that the responsibility for provoking this debate lay with France and other Western countries. The news item stated: "According to conference sources, Molotov expressed the hope that the delegates would soon begin studying actual proposals, especially regarding the military aspects of the proposed ceasefire... However, Bidault demanded the immediate withdrawal of Communist forces from Laos and Cambodia, resulting in a debate on the issues of Laos and Cambodia."

Some Western news agencies and newspapers also spread the notion that this issue was a "simple" "procedural matter," yet it was debated for so long, and that Western delegation members even expressed "surprise" at this. This statement is also not in accordance with the facts.

A "Manchester Guardian" reporter reported on the 19th: "If it is agreed to treat the issues of Laos and Cambodia as separate from Vietnam, it probably means that these issues will be resolved in different ways." This shows that this reporter also believes that it is not a question of how to discuss it, but how to resolve the issue.

An AP report on the 18th further admitted that this issue was by no means "simple," stating that the French proposal under discussion "demands the Viet Minh withdrawal from Laos and Cambodia as a condition of any ceasefire agreement." "A condition" of "any ceasefire agreement" - this shows that the conference is debating not a procedural issue, or a question of the method of discussion, but a substantive issue, namely how to restore peace in Indochina.

It can be seen from Western newspapers that the representatives of France and other Western countries are still repeating arguments they have made many times before. They continue to close their eyes to the existence of the resistance governments and armies of Cambodia and Laos and portray the national liberation movements in the two countries as "foreign." They still propose eliminating the resistance governments and armies of Laos and Cambodia, demanding the withdrawal of the Vietnamese People's Army, which does not exist in the two countries. They believe that this will solve the problems in Laos and Cambodia.

However, in fact, the national liberation movements in these two countries have existed for a long time. In Cambodia, there was the Bakunbo movement against French occupation as early as 1863; in Laos, there was the Phu Mi Bun movement as early as 1901. Members of the royal family, peasants, Buddhists, and ethnic minorities participated in the national liberation movements in these two countries.

In Cambodia, after French troops re-invaded in September 1945, the Cambodian people immediately took up arms and organized the Cambodian Independence Committee. In 1948, the Cambodian people's armed forces began to establish liberated areas. In April 1950, the Cambodian People's Representative Congress established the Cambodian Central People's Liberation Committee and produced a resistance government headed by Son Ngoc Minh. In June of the same year, the Cambodian Central People's Liberation Committee officially announced the independence of Cambodia.

In Laos, the people launched an uprising in August 1945. In October of the same year, the Provisional Resistance Government was established. In November of the same year, King Sisavang Vong abdicated and recognized the new government as the truly legitimate Lao government. In 1946, French troops reoccupied many cities in Laos, and the Lao Provisional Resistance Government moved to the countryside and established liberation committees in many places. In August 1950, the Lao People's Congress elected a resistance government headed by Souphanouvong in Free Laos. Half of the country's land and one million people have now been liberated.

As for the Lao and Cambodian puppet governments supported by France, they once served the French colonialists, then the Japanese imperialists, and now the American and French imperialists. Their armies are under the direct control of the French expeditionary force. They cannot represent the will of the Cambodian and Lao people.

Facts prove that any statement that portrays the national liberation movements of Cambodia and Laos as "foreign" is a distortion of the facts and a slander of the free aspirations and struggles of the people of the two countries. The sympathy and support of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are of course on the side of the national liberation movements of Cambodia and Laos. However, this sympathy and support are two different things from the national liberation struggles of the people of the two countries themselves and cannot be confused.

Therefore, to truly restore peace in Indochina, there must be a ceasefire throughout Indochina, in Vietnam, and also in Laos and Cambodia. The ceasefire should not be carried out separately, nor should it be carried out in sequence.

In fact, as mentioned earlier, the people of Cambodia and Laos, like the people of Vietnam, have the problem of being invaded by France, the problem of restoring peace, and the problem of restoring national rights. These issues cannot be casually "simply" ignored, but need to be seriously addressed in the same way as the issue of restoring peace in Vietnam.

France and other Western countries put forward such unreasonable demands and forced the conference to conduct time-consuming debates, while deliberately spreading many distorted statements. Obviously, their purpose is not to speed up the conference, but to delay the conference; not to make the problem easy to solve, but to make the problem difficult to solve.

In this regard, the propaganda carried out by certain American and French newspapers can provide clues to understanding this issue. They are propagandizing that the result of the Geneva Conference should prove that France must continue the Indochina war with American support.

An AP report on the 20th stated that the United States is waiting for "France to determine when further negotiations are useless."

An Agence France-Presse (AFP) report on the 19th stated that it may be announced within a few days what the United States' attitude will be when it cannot achieve an honorable ceasefire in Indochina in Geneva. Those more sober-minded French newspapers have already seen the danger of France following the United States in pursuing this policy, and they demand that the French delegation adopt a serious and consultative attitude at future meetings.

The French "Ouest-France" on the 18th said, "An agreement must be reached in the coming weeks. It is of no use for us to show intransigence. We should understand that peace will not come unless we make some concessions."

    新华社记者评西方记者对日内瓦秘密会议的歪曲报道
    【新华社日内瓦二十日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：对于十九日举行的日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的秘密会议，西方通讯社和报纸的记者们继续从他们的消息来源获知会内的情况，而按照协议，这些情况应该是不许向外透露的。得不到会议内情的东南亚一些国家的记者们抱怨说，西方国家的某些代表团并没有遵守会议秘密性的协议。他们举出一个例子：法国代表团的人员在会议进行的期间，每隔一会儿就出来一次，把他们认为需要透露的东西告诉法国的一些记者，会议刚刚结束，法国代表团的人员马上又和记者们作同样性质的交谈。
    根据报道，十九日会议讨论的是：是否应把高棉、寮国问题和越南问题分别来处理。
    有些西方的通讯社和报纸把进行了两天的对于这个问题的争论，说成是“共产党方面”引起的。显然，这种说法不合乎事实。美联社在二十日发出的一条新闻里也承认挑起这场争论的责任在于法国方面和其他西方国家。这条新闻说：“据会议人士说，莫洛托夫表示希望代表们很快就从事研究实际的议案，特别是关于建议中的停战的军事方面……。然而皮杜尔却要求共产党军队立即退出寮国和高棉，结果挑起了关于寮国和高棉问题的争论。”
    有些西方的通讯社和报纸还散布这样的说法，似乎这个问题是一个“简单”的“程序问题”，然而却争论了这样久，他们说西方国家代表团的人士对此甚至表示“惊讶”。这种说法自然也是不合乎事实的。
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”记者在十九日报道说：“如果同意把寮国、高棉的问题当作一个和越南分开的问题，这大概就意味着要以不同的方式来解决这些问题。”由此可见，这个记者也认为这不是用什么方式来讨论、而是用什么方式来解决的问题。
    美联社在十八日的报道里更承认了这个问题绝不“简单”，它说，会议讨论的法国建议“要求在寮国和高棉的越盟撤退，作为任何停火协议的一个条件”。“任何停火协议”的“条件”——这就说明：会议辩论的不是一个程序问题，或讨论的方式问题，而是一个实质问题，即如何恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    从西方报纸上可以看出：法国及其他西方国家的代表们在会议上仍然是重复他们已讲过多次的论调。他们依旧闭上眼睛不承认高棉和寮国抗战政府和军队的存在，并把两个国家的民族解放运动说成是“外来的”东西。他们仍然提出消灭寮国和高棉抗战政府和军队的主张，要求撤退在两国并不存在的越南人民军。他们认为这样就解决了在寮国和高棉的问题。
    然而事实上，这两个国家的民族解放运动已经存在很久很久了。在高棉，早在一八六三年就有了反抗法国占领的巴昆波运动；在寮国，早在一九零一年就有了弗米奔运动。在这两个国家里参加民族解放运动的有王族的人员、农民、佛教徒和少数民族。
    在高棉，在法国军队于一九四五年九月重新侵入之后，高棉人民立即拿起武器并组织了高棉独立委员会。一九四八年，高棉人民武装开始建立了解放区。一九五零年四月，高棉人民代表大会成立了高棉中央人民解放委员会，并产生了以山玉明为首的抗战政府。同年六月，高棉中央人民解放委员会正式宣布了高棉的独立。
    在寮国，人民在一九四五年八月就举行了起义。同年十月，临时抗战政府成立。同年十一月，寮国国王西萨望·汪退位，并承认新政府为真正合法的寮国政府。一九四六年，法国军队重新占领了寮国许多城市，寮国临时抗战政府迁到乡村，在许多地方成立了解放委员会。一九五零年八月，在自由寮国人民代表大会上选出了以苏发努冯为首的抗战政府。现在全国一半土地以及百万人民均已解放。
    至于为法国所支持的寮国和高棉傀儡政府，他们曾经为法国殖民者服务，继之为日本帝国主义者服务，现在又为美法帝国主义者服务。他们的军队是在法国远征军直接管辖之下。他们才是不能代表高棉和寮国人民意志的。
    事实证明，任何把高棉、寮国的民族解放运动说成“外来的”那种说法，都是歪曲事实的，都是对于两国人民的自由愿望和斗争的诽谤。越南民主共和国的同情和支持当然是在高棉和寮国民族解放运动方面。但是，这种同情和支持是和两国人民自己的民族解放斗争是两件事，是不能混为一谈的。
    因此要真正恢复印度支那和平，就必须在印度支那全境，在越南、也同时在寮国和高棉停火。停火是不应该分别进行，也不应该先后进行的。
    事实上，如前所述，高棉和寮国人民和越南人民一样，有着受法国侵略的问题，有着恢复和平的问题，有着恢复民族权利的问题。这些问题是不能随便加以“简单”抹煞的，而是和恢复越南和平问题同样需要认真处理的。
    法国和其他西方国家提出那种无理的主张来，并强迫会议进行了费时的争论，同时又故意散播许多歪曲的说法。显然其目的不是加速会议的进行，而是延迟会议的进行；不是使问题容易解决，而是使问题难以解决。
    在这方面，美国和法国某些报纸所进行的宣传可以提供了解这个问题的线索。他们正在宣传着日内瓦会议的结果应该是证明法国必须在美国支持下继续印度支那战争。
    美联社二十日的报道说，美国正在等待“法国判定了进一步谈判是没有用处的时候”。
    法新社十九日的报道说，几天之内可能就要宣布美国在日内瓦不能获致印度支那光荣停战时的态度。那些比较清醒的法国报纸已经看出了法国追随美国奉行这种政策的危险性，他们要求法国代表团在今后的会议上采取认真协商的态度。
    十八日的法国“西部邮报”说，“必须在最近几周内取得协议。我们表现不妥协是一点用处也没有的。我们应当了解我们不作些让步，和平是不会到来的。”
