Supporting the Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Commerce between the Tibet Region of China and India
Dalai Lama's Telegram to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

In accordance with the spirit of your great policies of national equality, freedom of religious belief, and peaceful diplomacy, the Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Commerce between the Tibet Region of China and India was signed in Beijing, along with an exchange of notes. This allows Sino-Indian relations in the Tibet Region of China to be re-established on a new foundation through consultation. It not only conforms to the common interests and traditional friendship of the peoples of China and India, but also completely conforms to the interests of the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people. I fully support this agreement and believe that it will enhance the unity of the peoples of China and India, and is of great significance for consolidating peace in Asia and the world. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and highest respect to you and the Central People's Government!

Dalai Lama, May 20, 1954

Panchen Erdeni's Telegram to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

The delegation of our Central People's Government and the delegation of the Government of the Republic of India, on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, have signed the Agreement on Trade and Commerce between the Tibet Region of China and India, and exchanged notes. The news has greatly excited the Tibetan people. On behalf of the monks and laypeople under my jurisdiction, I firmly support the provisions of this agreement and the notes. Under your leadership, New China is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, enabling the two great Asian nations of China and India to open a new page in the history of relations in the Tibet Region of China, and laying a good foundation for the friendship between the peoples of our country and India. This agreement not only conforms to the interests of the peoples of our country and India, but especially the Tibetan people realize that this agreement will surely bring much happiness to the peoples of both countries, which would not have been easy to achieve in the past historical periods. Therefore, I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, the leader of our great motherland!

Panchen Erdeni, May 17, 1954

Telegram from the Kashag of the Local Government of Tibet to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government

Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

Under your wise leadership, the Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Commerce between the Tibet Region of China and India has been signed, along with an exchange of notes. It was signed on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This agreement fully conforms to the interests of the Tibetan nationality and the Tibetan people, conforms to the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and India, and lays a new foundation for Sino-Indian relations in the Tibet Region of China, providing favorable conditions for further development of trade and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and India. However, we deeply realize that during the Sino-Indian negotiations, the imperialists spread rumors in an attempt to provoke the friendship between the peoples of China and India, provoke the relationship between the central government and the local government of Tibet, and undermine the Sino-Indian negotiations. Even after the agreement is signed, the imperialists will continue to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities. Therefore, we assure you that we will be a hundred times more vigilant, and under the close unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, we will wholeheartedly support and conscientiously implement the agreement, firmly adhere to the Central People's Government's diplomatic policy and national equality policy, promote the spirit of patriotism, and work together with the central government personnel and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet to continue to strive to gradually realize the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, as well as the unity within the Tibetan nationality, and strive for the peaceful construction of the great motherland, for building a prosperous and happy new Tibet, for consolidating national defense and defending peace in Asia and the world! We extend our warm congratulations and heartfelt thanks to you and the Central People's Government, and offer our highest respect. We wish you a long life!

Respectfully presented by the Kashag of the Local Government of Tibet, May 20, 1954
The 18th day of the 3rd month of the Wood Horse Year in the Tibetan calendar.

    西藏地方政府噶厦致毛主席电中央人民政府毛主席：
    在您的英明领导下，签订了中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，并互换了照会。它是根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠及和平共处的原则而签订的。这个协定是完全符合于西藏民族和西藏人民利益的，符合于中印两国人民之间传统友谊的，并为中印两国在中国西藏地方的关系奠定了新的基础，为进一步发展中印两国人民之间的通商贸易与文化交流，提供了有利的条件。但是我们深刻地认识到，在中印谈判期间，帝国主义者曾经散布谣言，企图挑拨中印两国人民的友谊，挑拨中央与西藏地方的关系，破坏中印谈判。就在协定签订之后，帝国主义者还会继续进行各种阴谋破坏活动的。因此，谨向您保证：我们将百倍地提高警惕，并在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的亲密团结下，衷心拥护和认真执行协定，坚决本着中央人民政府的外交政策、民族平等政策，发扬爱国主义精神，与进藏中央工作人员和进藏人民解放军一道，继续努力，逐步实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，巩固祖国的统一和各民族间的团结，以及西藏民族内部的团结，为伟大祖国的和平建设事业、为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏、为巩固祖国国防与保卫亚洲及世界和平而努力奋斗！谨向您和中央人民政府致以热忱的祝贺和衷心的感谢，并致崇高的敬礼。敬祝您万寿无疆！
