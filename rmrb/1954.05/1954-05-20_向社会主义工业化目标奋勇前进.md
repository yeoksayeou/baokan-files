    Striving Forward Towards the Goal of Socialist Industrialization
    New Automated Cracking Plant Built by Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company
    Under the leadership of Soviet experts, the various ethnic groups of workers at the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company's refinery and construction and renovation departments overcame many material and technical difficulties and successfully completed the construction of a highly automated cracking plant. By early May, they had begun inspecting various pieces of equipment in preparation for officially commencing production.
    The entire project of this factory was designed by Soviet experts. Some of the designs were based on Soviet experiences that had only recently been summarized. The machinery and equipment were also new-style products from the Soviet Union. The Soviet factory that produced the centrifugal pumps even specially dispatched an expert to help with the installation.
    When erecting a large chimney about forty meters high, Soviet comrades in charge of the project forbade workers from approaching the chimney being erected to avoid danger. Boliakov was suffering from arthritis, but he often climbed up to the high boom to check the condition of the wire ropes and pulleys. When installing the trays in the fractionation tower, the weather was very hot, and it was very difficult to perform electric welding in the oil tower. Comrade Rimaev asked the workers to bring a pipe and constantly pour cold water on his head, but he still insisted on working. When installing the heating furnace, the weather was already very cold, and it was snowing heavily. Hands would stick when touching the iron furnace tubes and frames. Comrades Aliotov and Ramashkin led the installation workers, sometimes working for more than ten hours, even working on their days off. Comrade Guotlov was ill, and the leadership repeatedly asked him to return to his country for recuperation, but he said, "The cracking plant is under construction, I will return after it is completed." This great spirit of internationalism greatly encouraged our workers and ensured the successful completion of the cracking plant.
    Hegang Coal Mine's Dalu Inclined Shaft Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The newly built Dalu inclined shaft of Hegang Coal Mine has been completed two months ahead of schedule and was handed over for production on May 1st.
    The inclined shaft project is a new type of inclined shaft designed by our country. All roadway specifications, lifting capacity, and in-shaft transportation and ventilation are constructed according to mechanization requirements. It will support national construction with hundreds of thousands of tons of raw coal every year.
    In the process of shaft construction, the workers overcame many difficulties. For example, when working on a piece of upward working face in the main shaft, the specifications were small, the slope was large, and the shaft inclination once reached more than eighty degrees. The workers pulled ropes to climb up to work; when transporting the shaft timber, the workers used ropes to pull it up section by section. Under such difficult conditions, there was not a single accident, and work efficiency was continuously improved. The completion volume in the first quarter of this year increased by 22 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year.
    Shuangyashan Lingxi Vertical Shaft Under Tense Construction
    The mining, civil engineering, and electromechanical installation projects of the Shuangyashan Lingxi vertical shaft are currently entering the most tense construction phase.
    This pair of modern vertical shaft projects was designed by our country itself, and it is expected to be completed and handed over for production in the fourth quarter of this year. The raw coal produced by the shaft can not only supply the needs of coking, but also be used to manufacture dozens of industrial raw materials such as artificial fibers, artificial rubber, engine oil, medicines, spices, dyes, and lubricating oil.
    The total workload of this vertical shaft this year has increased by 60 percent compared with last year. In order to ensure that this new type of vertical shaft is put into production on schedule, workers of all trades have launched a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content, and have successively promoted 22 decisive advanced experiences in various trades, thus greatly accelerating the progress of the project and ensuring the quality of the project. The installation project started in October last year and is still in full swing. The auxiliary shaft headframe has been installed, and the main shaft headframe started construction on May 3rd and is expected to be completed by the end of May.
    New Local State-Owned Shantou Power Plant Begins Generating Electricity
    The newly built local state-owned Shantou Power Plant started generating electricity in early April this year.
    The power generation capacity of this plant exceeds the power generation capacity of the original Kaiming Power Plant in Shantou City by nearly one time. It can fully supply the lighting and industrial electricity for the city's population of 200,000. In the process of capital construction, in order to reduce the cost of power generation, the design of the boiler was specially changed so that the new boiler can use the nearby coal mine's white coal and increase the evaporation of the boiler; in order to take care of future production development and urban hygiene, the new plant site was selected in the suburbs. At the same time, the equipment of the original power plant was used as much as possible so that when the new plant is shut down for maintenance, the equipment of the old plant can be used to replace the power supply.
    Fujian Nanping Cement Plant to Commence Construction Soon
    The Fujian Provincial Department of Industry will build a fairly large mechanized cement plant in Nanping.
    The Nanping Cement Plant will use the local high-quality limestone and Jian'ou Lishan coal as the main raw materials and fuel. Except for manual mining of limestone, all processes are mechanized or semi-mechanized. Light rail tracks are also set up between the plant buildings and the mining area to quickly transport the limestone to the plant. After the plant starts production, the cement needed by Fujian Province can basically be supplied by the plant in a timely manner.
    All the machinery and equipment of the Nanping Cement Plant will be made in our country. Shanghai's machinery manufacturing plants will manufacture huge crushers, ball mills and other machinery and equipment for the plant. Engineers from the East China Chemical Bureau and Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Plant have provided great assistance to the design work of the Nanping Cement Plant; Jiangnan Cement Plant will also send excellent technical personnel to help the Nanping Cement Plant carry out production. Shanghai Longhua Cement Plant is also preparing to train a large number of skilled workers for the plant. Fujian Province's local state-owned Fujian Machinery Plant, Fuzhou Construction Engineering Company, and local farmers will also provide great assistance to the plant.
    After several months of effort, the preliminary design of the plant has been successfully completed, and the technical design will also be completed soon. It is expected that the construction of plant buildings and other projects will start in June this year, and it will be officially put into production in the first quarter of next year.
    Underwater Sealing and Water Pumping of Pier No. 5 of the Hanshui Railway Bridge Completed
    The underwater concrete sealing and water pumping work of Pier No. 5 of the Hanshui Railway Bridge was completed on May 15th with good quality.
      On May 5th, the deputy director, director of the political department, and deputy chief engineer of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau braved the strong wind and rain to go to the site to guide the sealing work. The sealing work officially started at eleven o'clock. Huge raindrops hit everyone, but people did not flinch and insisted on working. Some workers felt that it was inconvenient to work in raincoats and rubber shoes, so they took them off to work. An Mingyang and Sun Guibin were afraid that the rain would wet the cement and damage the quality of the cement, so they took the lead in covering the cement with raincoats. For a time, many comrades also took off their raincoats and covered the cement, so that the cement was not affected by moisture and the quality was guaranteed. The workers in the material transportation team ate steamed buns while carrying sand and stones, and the workers in the chute team were sweating profusely and refused to rest for a moment. Bi Yunzhi, a loading and unloading worker, had prepared for the work the night before until more than five o'clock in the morning of the 5th before going to sleep, but at eleven o'clock he sneaked to the construction site to master the guide pipe. The workers of Wang Lizhong, Bi Yunzhi, Xu Zonglu, and Sun Zhigui's team took the initiative to help the workers of other teams after completing their own work. Engineer Zou Yizhang insisted on directing until the completion of the sealing work, insisting on working for more than 30 consecutive hours from the day before the sealing. Thanks to the selfless work of all the staff, after more than ten hours of intense work, the entire sealing work of Pier No. 5 was successfully completed at 9:50 pm that day.
      Pier No. 5 started pumping water on the 11th. After the water was pumped out on the 15th, the inspection proved that the quality of the sealing was very good, and the concrete foundation project started in the afternoon.
    Lower Structure of the Weihe Bridge Completed
    The workers who built the Weihe Bridge on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway successfully completed the lower structure project of the Weihe Bridge on May 6th.
    The lower structure project includes all the foundation projects from the bridge piers to the caissons at the bottom of the river below the steel beams. These projects must be completed before the flood season. According to the water level records of previous years, the Weihe River began to rise in early May. In order to rush all the foundation projects out of the water before the arrival of the flood, the Party Committee of the Bridge Engineering Team took emergency measures on April 21st to strengthen the organizational leadership of the construction work. The team leaders and main engineering and technical personnel went to the site to personally guide the construction. After continuous efforts, all the caissons were finally sunk to the specified depth on April 27th, and at the same time, leveling, sealing, and pier body pouring were carried out. By the afternoon of May 6th, the last pier body pouring had been completed. So far, the most arduous and complex lower foundation project of the Weihe Bridge has been spared the threat of floods and has achieved great success.
    During the most intense period of the project, Soviet bridge expert Comrade Luda visited the construction site and helped solve many technical difficulties. For example, a certain caisson had difficulty in correcting the deviation during sinking. After the expert suggested using increased pressure and high-pressure water jetting, it was quickly corrected.
    The beam erection project of the Weihe Bridge will start in early June and is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

    向社会主义工业化目标奋勇前进
    中苏石油公司新建一座自动化裂化厂
    中苏石油公司炼油厂、建筑装修处的各族职工们，在苏联专家的领导下，克服了物质和技术上的许多困难，胜利完成了高度自动化的裂化厂的建厂工作，到五月初已开始检查各项设备，准备正式开工生产。
    这座工厂的全部工程都是苏联专家设计出来的。有的设计是苏联最近才总结出来的经验。机器设备也是苏联的新式出品。生产离心泵的苏联工厂还专门派来了一位专家帮助安装。
    在竖立一个高约四十公尺的大烟囱时，为了避免危险，负责这项工程的苏联同志不准工人们走近这正在竖立起来的烟囱。波列可夫正患关节炎，但还时常爬到很高的吊杆上去检查钢丝绳和滑轮的情况。在安装分馏塔里的塔盘时，天气很热，在油塔里进行电焊是非常艰苦的，日马也夫同志叫工人拿了一根管子，不断地往他头上浇冷水，仍然坚持工作。在安装加热炉时，天气已很寒冷，下着大雪，手碰上铁的炉管、炉架就沾手。阿廖托夫、拉马希金两同志领导着安装工人们，有时坚持十几小时的工作，甚至休假也工作。果特洛夫同志患病，领导上几次要他回国休养，他说：“裂化厂正在修建，等完工后再回国。”这种伟大的国际主义精神，大大地鼓舞了我国的职工，保证了裂化厂的胜利完工。
    鹤岗煤矿大陆斜井提前竣工
    鹤岗煤矿新建的大陆斜井已提前两个月完工，在五月一日移交生产。
    该斜井工程是我国设计的新型斜井，所有井道规格，提升能力以及井内运输、通风等，都是按照机械化要求建设的。它每年将以数十万吨的原煤支援国家建设。
    在建井过程中，工人们曾克服了很多困难。如在做主井一片上山工作面的时候，规格小，坡度大，井斜曾经达到八十多度，工人们就拉着绳子爬上去工作；运搬井木的时候，工人们用绳子一段一段地往上拉。在这样困难条件下，没出过一次事故，而且不断地提高了工作效率，今年第一季度完成量比去年第四季度增加了百分之二十二。
    双鸭山岭西竖井紧张施工
    双鸭山岭西竖井矿务、土木和机电安装工程，目前正进入最紧张施工阶段。
    这一对近代化竖井工程是我国自己设计的，今年第四季度即可完工移交生产。该井所产的原煤，不仅可以供应炼焦需用，而且可以制造人造纤维、人造橡胶、发动机用油、药剂、香料、染料、润滑油等数十种工业原料。
    该竖井今年总工程量比去年增加了百分之六十。为了保证这座新型竖井按期投入生产，各工种工人开展了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，先后在各工种中推广了二十二种决定性的先进经验，因此大大加速了工程进度，保证了工程质量。安装工程从去年十月已开始，现仍在紧张进行。副井井架已安装完毕，主井井架从五月三日开始施工，预计五月底竣工。
    新建地方国营汕头电厂开始发电
    新建的地方国营汕头电厂已于今年四月初开始发电。
    该厂发电设备能力，超过汕头市原有的开明电厂发电能力将近一倍。可充分供应全市二十万人口的照明用电与工业用电。该厂在基本建设过程中，为了减轻发电成本，特别改变了锅炉的设计，使新建的锅炉能采用附近煤矿的白煤，并将锅炉的蒸发量提高；为了照顾将来生产发展及城市卫生，新厂地址选定在市郊外。同时，尽量利用原有电厂的设备，以便新厂检修停电时，可由旧厂的设备代替供电。
    福建南平水泥厂即将动工兴建
    福建省工业厅将在南平兴建一个规模相当大的机制水泥厂。
    南平水泥厂将利用当地质量优良的石灰石、建瓯黎山的煤作主要原材料和燃料，整个生产过程除开采石灰石用人工外，各个工序都是机械化、半机械化的。厂房和矿区间并设有轻便铁轨，以便把石灰石迅速运到厂内。该厂开始生产后，福建省所需水泥基本上可由该厂及时供应。
    南平水泥厂的全部机器设备都将由我国自制。上海各机器制造厂将为该厂制造巨大的粗碎机、球磨机等机器设备。华东化工局和南京江南水泥厂的工程师，对南平水泥厂的设计工作方面，曾经给予巨大的帮助；江南水泥厂并将派遣优秀的技术人员帮助南平水泥厂进行生产。上海龙华水泥厂也准备替该厂培养大批熟练工人。福建省地方国营福建机器厂、福州建筑工程公司以及当地农民也将给该厂很大的帮助。
    经过几个月的努力，目前该厂的初步设计已经胜利完成，技术设计也将在最近结束。预计今年六月，厂房等工程就要开始动工，明年第一季度即能正式投入生产。
    汉水铁桥五号桥墩已完成水下封底及抽水工作
    汉水铁桥五号桥墩水下混凝土封底及抽水工作，已于五月十五日完成，质量良好。
      五月五日，武汉大桥工程局副局长、政治部主任、副总工程师，都冒着狂风暴雨赶到现场指导封底工作。十一点钟封底工作正式开始。巨大的雨点打在每个人身上，但人们却毫不畏缩，坚持工作，有的工人嫌穿雨衣胶鞋工作起来不方便，便脱了来干。安明阳、孙贵宾怕雨淋湿了水泥，损害了水泥的质量，便带头把雨衣盖在水泥上面，一时许多同志也都把雨衣脱掉盖上，使水泥没有受到潮湿，保证了质量。运料组的工人拿着馒头边啃边抬砂、石，滑槽组的工人累得满头大汗，一刻也不肯休息。装吊工人毕云芝，头一天夜晚作准备工作到五日的清晨五点多钟才睡，但到十一点钟又溜到工地来掌握导管。王立中、毕云芝、徐宗鲁、孙芝桂小组的工人在自己的工作完成后，又主动帮助其他小组的工人干活，工程师邹义章从封底先一天起，连续坚持了三十多小时的工作还不肯休息，一直坚持指挥到封底工作完成。由于全体职工奋不顾身地工作，经过十多小时的紧张劳动，五号桥墩全部封底工作，在当天晚上九时五十分胜利完成。
      五号桥墩十一日开始抽水，十五日抽水完成后，检验证明封底的质量很好，下午便开始了混凝土基础工程的浇灌工作。
    渭河大桥下部工程完成
    修建宝成路渭河大桥的职工们，于五月六日胜利完成渭河大桥下部工程。
    下部工程包括钢梁以下从桥墩到河底沉井的全部基础工程。这些工程必须在洪水期以前全部完成。根据往年水位记载，五月上旬渭河即开始涨水。为了在洪水来临前把全部基础工程抢出水面，桥梁工程队的党委会于四月二十一日采取了紧急措施，加强了施工组织领导工作，队的领导同志和主要工程技术人员都下到现场亲自指导施工，经过不断努力，终于在四月二十七日使全部沉井下沉到规定深度，同时并进行整平、封填和墩身灌注工作，至五月六日下午，最后一个墩身灌注已经完毕。至此，渭河大桥最艰巨复杂的下部基础工程，已免去了洪水的威胁，取得了很大胜利。
    在工程最紧张时期，苏联桥梁专家鲁达同志曾往工地视察，帮助解决了很多技术上的困难，如某号沉井在下沉中发生了偏斜校正的困难，经专家建议用加重压力和高压射水等办法后，便很快校正过来。
    渭河大桥架梁工程将于六月初旬开始，预计月底可全部完成。
