    State-owned Commercial Departments in the Southwest Region Procure Various Summer Supplies
    State-owned commercial departments in the Southwest Region are preparing summer goods in advance and have increased the variety and quantity of summer goods. The second quarter planned sales of summer goods by the Southwest Region's Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company have increased by more than two times compared to the actual sales volume in the same period last year; more than 90% of the goods are now ready. The number of undershirts and vests prepared by the department store system in the whole region has increased by 1.8 times compared to last year. At the supply conference recently held by the Chongqing Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station, the number of undershirts and vests purchased by department stores and cooperatives in various counties increased by 70% to 80% compared to last year, and the variety of colors increased by more than 200.
    This year, when preparing summer goods, state-owned commercial departments in the Southwest Region generally paid attention to organizing sources of goods and allocating goods according to the different needs of urban and rural people in various places. Cotton yarn and fabric companies in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces have prepared a large number of light-colored cloth, light-colored shirting, Yuanfu silk and other commodities suitable for the needs of local farmers; the quantity of these commodities accounts for more than 60% of the total source of goods. This year, state-owned pharmaceutical companies have expanded the proportion of household medicines and actively transferred heatstroke prevention medicines such as Qingliang Dan, Rendan, painkillers, and Ten Drops Water to rural areas. At the same time, state-owned companies have also prepared a large number of new and high-quality commodities for large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas; the shortcomings of not distinguishing between urban and rural areas in operation have been initially overcome. In the past, department stores did not pay attention to the operation of commodities needed by women and children. This year, the undershirts prepared by the Chongqing Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station for women and children account for 40% of the total number of undershirts. State-owned companies have also purchased a large number of silk waistbands, soft satin, wool silk, Banling, Beijing felt nests and other commodities from Beijing, Chengdu and other places, which will be supplied to ethnic minorities in Xikang and other places.
    The transportation conditions in the Southwest Region are poor. In the past, difficulties in transportation often prevented prepared commodities from being transported to sales locations in time. This year, due to the early organization of sources of goods, allocation of goods, and strengthening of the work of transshipment links such as Yichang and Chongqing, this phenomenon has been avoided.

    西南区国营商业部门采办各种夏季用品
    西南区国营商业部门提前准备夏季货物，并增加了夏令货的品种和数量。西南全区花纱布公司第二季度计划销售的夏令货，比去年同期实际销售量增加两倍多；现在百分之九十以上的货物已经准备就绪。全区百货系统准备的汗衫、背心，比去年增加了一点八倍。最近重庆百货采购供应站召开的供应会议上，各地县百货商店、县合作社等购买的汗衫、背心数量比去年增加了百分之七十到八十，花色增加了二百多种。
    今年西南区国营商业部门准备夏季商品时，一般都注意根据各地城乡人民的不同需要，进行组织货源和调拨货物等工作。四川、云南、贵州等省的花纱布公司准备了大量的浅花布、浅士林、元府绸等适合当地农民需要的商品；这些商品的数量，占货源总量的百分之六十以上。国营医药公司今年扩大了家用成药的经营比重，并积极将农村需要的清凉丹、仁丹、止痛片、十滴水等暑期成药调往农村。同时，各国营公司也为大、中城市及工矿区准备了大量花色新颖、质量较高的商品；经营中城乡不分的缺点，已经有了初步克服。过去百货公司对于妇女和儿童需要的商品没有注意经营，今年重庆百货采购供应站为妇女和儿童准备的汗衫，占汗衫总数的百分之四十。各国营公司还从北京、成都等地采购了大批丝腰带、软缎、毛绸、板绫、京毡窝等商品，将供应西康等地的少数民族人民。
    西南区交通条件较差，过去常常因为运输中的困难，使已经准备好的商品不能及时运到销货地点。今年由于提前组织货源，调拨货物，并加强了宜昌、重庆等转运环节的工作，避免了这种现象。
