Geneva Dispatch

    The Inviolable Common Will of the People of Indochina
    Our Correspondents Wu Wentao and Du Bo

    Western newspapers and news agencies have recently been constantly revealing the content of the discussions on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. Reuters' Geneva correspondent said in his report on the 19th: "The West insists that there are no political issues to be resolved in Laos and Cambodia because they are independent countries and are only suffering from external threats." Many reports also said that representatives of Western countries are trying to deal with Laos and Cambodia separately from the Vietnam issue, saying that the issues in Laos and Cambodia are simple and can be resolved as long as the Vietnamese People's Army withdraws from there.

    There is a reason why the Western press is now emphasizing this issue. As everyone knows, as early as the general discussion on the Indochina issue, French Foreign Minister Bidault, in his three speeches, tirelessly said that the resistance governments of Laos and Cambodia were "phantoms," that there was "Viet Minh aggression," and that "the Lao and Cambodian issues are simple and can be completed as long as the Viet Minh aggressors withdraw their troops," trying to dismember the Lao and Cambodian issues from the entire Indochina issue, in order to achieve the colonialist goal of strangling the national independence of the two countries.

    Was there no people's anti-French war in Laos and Cambodia? Were there no resistance governments and armies of the two countries? Anyone who is not blindly speaking nonsense cannot deny the ironclad facts. The London "Times" of May 15th said: "Since the Geneva Conference began to discuss the Indochina issue, the resistance movements in Laos and Cambodia, which have been reported in the news, have complex histories. Like the Viet Minh, they started as national movements and seized power by seizing the opportunity of the Japanese 'coup' in March 1945."

    Who are the aggressors in Laos and Cambodia? Is it the Democratic Republic of Vietnam? Or is it the French colonialists? Anyone with a little reason can make a factual answer. Many political leaders in Asia do not believe that it is the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that is invading Indochina, but France. Recent speeches by Indian Prime Minister Nehru and the Colombo Conference communiqué of the Prime Ministers of the five Southeast Asian countries stated that the war in Indochina was a French colonial war. To describe the anti-French war of the people of Laos and Cambodia as "aggression" by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is as absurd as describing the French resistance movement against German fascism in World War II as "aggression" by France. As for describing the Vietnamese people's anti-French war as a "civil war," that is even more absurd. Is Vietnam France? Is it a civil war for French troops to travel across the ocean to Vietnam?

    Some say the issues in Laos and Cambodia are simple. Naturally, the entire Indochina issue is also very simple. The simplest solution is for the United States to stop interfering, for French troops to withdraw completely, and for the people of Indochina to solve their own problems. This is the simplest solution. However, the ruling groups in the United States and the war faction in France are adamantly opposed to such a simple solution.

    It is very simple and effortless for Smith and Bidault to say a word; but how can they obliterate a glorious history of people fighting for independence and liberation? There is no need to look back too far. Who does not remember that in March 1945, the French colonialists fled in panic in front of the Japanese fascist army, and the feudal puppets of Laos and Cambodia became collaborators of the Japanese fascists. In the people of the two countries and the Vietnamese people rising up to resist, Japanese fascism was severely hit. When the French colonialists returned after Japan surrendered and wanted to forcibly impose the old colonial rule on the people of the three countries, the people of the three countries carried out a heroic war of resistance for independence and freedom. The anti-French forces of the Lao and Cambodian people have continued to grow and strengthen in the common struggle. In 1950, representatives of the Lao and Cambodian people held people's congresses and established resistance governments, electing Souphanouvong and Son Ngoc Minh as the government leaders of Laos and Cambodia. These two people's regimes, which have liberated vast territories and are supported by the people, formally established the Three-Country Joint National United Front with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in March 1951, to fight against the common enemy of the people of the three countries—the French colonialists and their puppets supported by American imperialism—and strive for the true independence and unification of their motherlands.

    For many years, because the French colonialists not only invaded Vietnam, but also invaded Laos and Cambodia at the same time, the people of the three countries have been sharing life and death and are closely related. The Vietnamese living in Laos and the Vietnamese living in Cambodia also joined their Lao and Cambodian brothers in resisting the French colonialists and their puppets. The common goal of the people of the three countries is to liberate their motherlands from the enslavement of the French colonial rulers. The common issue of the three countries of Indochina is to end French colonial rule, end the war, and restore peace. This is the truth of history and the current reality. Smith and Bidault deliberately distorting the facts by not talking about history is intentional and cannot solve the problem.

    It is obvious that there is a significant consistency in the issues of the three countries of Indochina. Any attempt to separate the issues of Laos and Cambodia from the issue of Vietnam not only does not conform to the existing facts in the three countries of Indochina, but also violates the common interests and wishes of the people of the three countries. In fact, the communiqué of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference did not say that the Indochina issue should be resolved separately, but that one of the main tasks of the Geneva Conference was to restore peace in Indochina. This agreement was agreed to by the foreign ministers of France, the United States, and Britain at the time. The conference of the Prime Ministers of the five Southeast Asian countries held in Colombo also proposed to stop the war in Indochina, and similarly did not say that the wars in the three countries of Indochina should be handled separately. Even the official spokespersons of France and the United States and Western newspapers have raised the Indochina issue as a complete issue. Smith, Bidault, and the like deliberately distort the facts and insist that the Vietnam is a civil war, and that Laos and Cambodia are already independent and autonomous countries. This proves that they are still trying to obliterate the desire for national independence of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and conceal the undeniable fact that France is carrying out a colonial war in Indochina. Laos and Cambodia are not truly independent as Bidault and others claim. It is enough to cite a ridiculous fact that happened in Geneva to illustrate this. At a French press conference, a reporter asked the French spokesperson: "How much land and population do Laos and Cambodia have?" The spokesperson, who claimed to represent the interests of the people of Laos and Cambodia, was not only dumbfounded and unable to answer, but also said: "Even if you ask the representatives of the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia, they may not be able to answer." This fully shows that the regimes in Phnom Penh and Vientiane cannot represent the people of Laos and Cambodia at all, and are merely puppets of the French colonialists. Only the resistance governments and liberation armies of Laos and Cambodia truly represent the people of Laos and Cambodia. Isn't this a very clear fact?

    Bidault refused to allow the resistance governments of Laos and Cambodia to send representatives to attend the Geneva Conference to present their own propositions, and at the same time self-deceivingly said that there is no national liberation movement of the people of Laos and Cambodia, and no resistance government of the people of Laos and Cambodia, indicating that he dare not face reality. This method of obliterating facts cannot solve any problems at all. If we follow the propositions of Bidault and others, the Geneva Conference will only talk about the ceasefire in Vietnam, and will not talk about the anti-war movements of the people of Laos and Cambodia striving for national independence, and the war in Indochina will still not be able to stop.

    The French colonialists have carried out years of aggressive war, and have neither conquered the Vietnamese people nor the people of Laos and Cambodia. Now they still want to obtain at the Geneva Conference what they could not obtain on the battlefield, and want to eliminate the resistance forces of Laos and Cambodia. This is simply wishful thinking. If the Geneva Conference is to achieve something and truly restore peace in Indochina, it must dare to face the facts and at the same time meet the common demands of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia for freedom and independence.

### 日内瓦通讯印度支那人民的共同意志不可侮

    印度支那人民的共同意志不可侮
    本报记者　吴文焘　杜波
    日来西方报纸和通讯社不断透露日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题讨论的内容。路透社驻日内瓦记者在他十九日的报道中说：“西方坚持在寮国和高棉没有政治问题要解决，因为它们是独立的国家，所遭受到的只是外来的威胁”。许多消息还说，西方国家的代表们力图把寮国和高棉与越南问题分别处理，说寮国和高棉的问题很简单，只要越南人民军从那里撤退就解决了。
    西方新闻界现在强调这个问题不是没有原因的。大家知道，早在印度支那问题的一般讨论时，法国外长皮杜尔在三次发言中，都不惮其烦地说什么寮国和高棉的抗战政府是“幽灵”、“越盟侵略”、“寮国高棉问题很简单，只要越盟侵略者撤了兵就可完事大吉”，想把寮国、高棉的问题从整个印度支那问题中肢解出来，达到绞杀两国人民的民族独立的殖民主义的目的。
    寮国和高棉没有人民的抗法战争、没有两国人民的抗战政府和军队吗？只要不是闭着眼睛瞎说的人，都不能否认铁的事实。五月十五日的伦敦“泰晤士报”就这样说：“从日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题以来，列入新闻的寮国和高棉的抵抗运动，都有复杂的历史，正像越盟一样，是由民族运动开始，并抓住一九四五年三月日本的‘政变’，而赢取政权的。”
    谁是在寮国和高棉的侵略者呢？是越南民主共和国呢？还是法国殖民主义者呢？只要是稍有理性的人，都能作出合乎事实的答案。亚洲许多国家的政治领袖，并不认为侵略印度支那的是越南民主共和国而不是法国。最近印度总理尼赫鲁的演说和东南亚五国总理的科伦坡会议的公报，都说印度支那的战争是法国的殖民主义战争。把寮国和高棉人民的抗法战争说成是越南民主共和国的“侵略”，正如把第二次大战中法国的反对德国法西斯的抵抗运动说成是法国的“侵略”那样荒唐。至于把越南人民的抗法战争说成是“内战”，那更是荒唐得没有边了。难道越南就是法国，法国军队远涉重洋到越南来是打内战吗？
    有人说寮国和高棉的问题很简单。自然，整个印度支那问题本来也很简单。最简单的解决办法就是美国停止干涉，法国军队完全撤离，让印度支那人民自己解决自己的问题。这是最简单不过的办法了。但是，美国的统治集团和法国的主战派却偏偏反对这样的简单的解决办法。
    史密斯和皮杜尔说一句话是很简单和不费吹灰之力的；但他们怎能把一部人民为求独立解放而斗争的辉煌历史予以抹煞呢？远者不用追述了。谁不记得一九四五年三月，在日本法西斯军队面前法国殖民者仓惶逃遁、寮国和高棉的封建傀儡们成了日本法西斯的合作者。在两国人民和越南人民奋起抵抗中，日本法西斯遭到了严重的打击。而当法国殖民者在日本投降后卷土重来、并用武力要将老的殖民统治重加于三国人民头上时，三国人民为了独立和自由，进行了英勇的抗战。寮国和高棉人民的抗战力量，在共同斗争中不断成长和壮大。就在一九五零年，寮国和高棉人民的代表分别举行了人民代表大会并成立了抗战政府，选出苏发努冯和山玉明为寮国和高棉的政府领袖。这两个解放了广大国土、并为人民所拥护的人民政权于一九五一年三月与越南民主共和国共同正式成立三国联合民族统一战线，为击败三国人民的共同敌人——在美国帝国主义支持下的法国殖民者及其傀儡，获得祖国的真正独立和统一而奋斗。
    多少年来，由于法国殖民主义者不仅侵略了越南，而且同时也侵略寮国和高棉，三国的人民生死与共，休戚相关，原来居住在寮国的越南人和居住在高棉的越南人，也和他们的寮国和高棉的兄弟们一道反抗法国殖民者和它的傀儡们。三国人民的共同的奋斗目标，就是把自己的祖国从法国殖民统治者的奴役下解放出来。印度支那三国的共同问题，就是结束法国的殖民统治，结束战争，恢复和平。这是历史的真相和目前的实际。史密斯、皮杜尔口口声声不谈历史是别有用心，而且也是不能解决问题的。
    很明显，印度支那三国的问题存在着重大的一致性，任何想把寮国及高棉问题与越南问题分割开来解决，这不但与印度支那三国现存的事实不相符，而且是违背了三国人民的共同利益和愿望的。事实上，柏林四国外长会议的公报中，也并没有说把印度支那问题分开来解决，而是说日内瓦会议的主要任务之一，就是恢复印度支那和平问题。这个协议是当时法国、美国以及英国的外长都同意的。在科伦坡举行的东南亚五国总理会议，也提出要停止印度支那战争，同样没有说要把在印度支那三国的战争分别处理。甚至法国、美国的官方发言人以及西方的报纸，也把印度支那问题作为一个完整的问题提了出来。史密斯、皮杜尔之流故意歪曲事实，硬说越南是内战，寮国和高棉是已经独立自主的国家，这证明他们到现在仍然在企图抹煞越南、寮国和高棉人民的民族独立的愿望，掩饰法国在印度支那进行殖民战争的无可否认的事实。寮国和高棉并不是如皮杜尔们所说的真正独立了。只要举在日内瓦发生的一件可笑的事实来说明就够了。在某次法国举行的记者招待会上，有记者问法国的发言人：“寮国和高棉有多少土地和人口？”这个自称代表寮国和高棉人民利益的发言人不仅瞠目不知所对，根本回答不出来，并且说：“你即使问寮国和高棉王国的代表，也不见得能回答得出。”这就完全说明，现在金边和万象的政权，根本不能代表寮国和高棉人民，只是法国殖民者的傀儡。只有寮国和高棉的抗战政府和解放军，才是真正代表寮国和高棉人民的，这难道不是非常清楚的事实吗？
    皮杜尔既拒绝寮国和高棉抗战政府派遣代表出席日内瓦会议，提出两国人民自己的主张，又自欺欺人地说那里没有寮国和高棉人民的民族解放运动，没有寮国和高棉人民自己的抗战政府，表明他不敢面对现实。这种抹煞事实的办法，是根本解决不了任何问题的。如果按照皮杜尔们的主张，日内瓦会议只谈越南停战，不谈寮国和高棉人民争取民族独立的抗战运动，印度支那的战争还是不能停止的。
    法国殖民者进行了多年的侵略战争，既没有征服越南人民，也没有征服寮国和高棉人民。现在他们还居然要在日内瓦会议上取得他们在战场上得不到的东西，想把寮国和高棉的抗战力量消灭，简直是妄想。日内瓦会议要有所成就，真正恢复印度支那的和平，就必须敢于面对事实，同时满足越南、寮国和高棉人民的共同的自由独立的要求。
