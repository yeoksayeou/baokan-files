Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 9th: The state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory is promoting the advanced Soviet textile industry experience of increasing the size of finished and semi-finished product packages, thereby improving production efficiency. It is estimated that, under existing equipment conditions, it can increase production and save nearly 10 billion yuan in wealth for the country annually.

The advanced experience of increasing package size involves enlarging the weight, length, and volume of processed goods in each process from cotton cleaning and spinning to weaving. This reduces the downtime caused by doffing, joining, and shuttle changes, thereby increasing labor productivity.

In the factory's second and third weaving workshops, ordinary shuttles were previously used, with each shuttle winding only 17.6 inches of weft yarn. After switching to large shuttles, each shuttle's weft yarn can weave 25 inches. Each loom can produce an additional 0.6 yards of cloth in eight hours, resulting in an annual increase of more than 26,700 bolts of cloth. The fine spinning workshop has increased the weft yarn package size, reducing downtime and enabling the spinning of more than 89,500 pounds of cotton yarn per year. After increasing the length of laps and slivers on the cotton cleaners and steel wire machines, multiple tests have shown that the quality of both laps and slivers has improved, reducing yarn breakage during spinning and improving the quality of the cotton yarn. The promotion of the advanced experience of increasing package size has also enabled the weaving machine operators to reduce shuttle changes by 198 times in eight hours, allowing them more time to strengthen patrol and inspection of the fabric surface, increasing their capacity from the previous nine machines to twelve machines. In the fine spinning workshop, due to the reduction in doffing frequency, more than 30 doffing workers have been freed up. Some skilled workers have also been freed up from the pre-spinning departments. This technical workforce will be able to support newly built cotton textile factories. Currently, the factory is continuing to promote this advanced experience in order to further improve labor productivity.

    天津第二棉纺织厂推行苏联加大成型经验
    一年可为国家增产节约近一百亿元的财富
    【新华社天津九日电】国营天津第二棉纺织厂推广苏联纺织工业加大成品和半成品成型的先进经验，提高了生产效率。据估计，在现有设备的条件下，一年约可为国家增产节约近一百亿元的财富。
    加大成型的先进经验，就是把从清花、纺纱到织布的每一道工序中的加工品的重量、长度、容量加大，这样就能减少生产过程中因落纱、接头和换梭而间断的时间，使劳动生产率得以提高。
    这个工厂的第二、第三布场，过去用普通梭子织布，每只梭子上所缠的纬纱只能织十七吋六分布，改用大梭子以后，每只梭子的纬纱能织二十五吋，每台布机在八小时内就可以增产零点六码布，一年就能多织二万六千七百多匹布。细纱车间加大了纬纱成型，使停台时间减少，一年能多纺八万九千五百多磅棉纱。清花机、钢丝机上的花卷和棉条增加长度以后，根据多次测定，花卷和棉条的品质都有提高，使棉条在纺成棉纱时断头减少，改善了棉纱的品质。加大成型先进经验的推广，还使得布机挡车工在八小时内可以少换一百九十八次梭子，因而有更多时间加强巡回和检查布面的工作，看台能力由过去的九台增加到十二台。细纱车间中因为落纱次数减少，省出了三十多个落纱工。前纺部门也省出了一些熟练工人。这批技术力量将可以支援新建的棉纺织厂。现在，这个厂正在继续推行这一先进经验，以便进一步提高劳动生产率。
