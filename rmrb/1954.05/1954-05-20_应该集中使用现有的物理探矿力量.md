    Existing Physical Prospecting Forces Should Be Used Concentratedly
    Physical prospecting is an important method in geological exploration. It uses scientific instruments to detect underground treasures based on differences in the physical properties of ore bodies. When combined with surface surveys and drilling in geological work, it can economically and accurately determine the existence of ore bodies below the surface. China's geological work has a weak foundation, and physical prospecting is an emerging undertaking. Large-scale work in this area has only begun in the past two or three years. Therefore, rationally using existing physical prospecting forces, allowing them to fully play their role and rapidly improve their technical level to meet the needs of national construction, is a noteworthy issue.
    Two letters from readers published in this newspaper today reflect the situation where the manpower and equipment of the physical prospecting teams under the Ministry of Heavy Industry are not being used rationally. According to our understanding, these situations are indeed true. Since its establishment in 1950, the physical prospecting team under the Ministry of Heavy Industry has been scattered among units such as the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Iron and Steel Industry Administration, Chemical Industry Administration, and Building Materials Industry Administration. This decentralized state is detrimental to the full utilization of existing manpower and material resources, and the future development of physical prospecting technology. Because physical prospecting technology is relatively complex, working methods and experience are not yet mature, and the research of various methods and theories, instruments and data must be carried out by more manpower division of labor and cooperation, which is impossible in a decentralized state. For example, the physical prospecting work of Anshan Iron and Steel Company currently needs to solve some structural problems, and it is necessary to use gravity, magnetic and electrical methods for comprehensive exploration, but they only have three technicians, so they are powerless. Physical prospecting must be effective only when the ore deposit has certain physical and geological conditions. Therefore, the physical prospecting tasks of various production departments are not necessarily regular. In a decentralized state, technical forces and instruments cannot be uniformly allocated, which inevitably wastes manpower and material resources. The serious idleness of the physical prospecting team of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration is an example of manpower waste. There are similar situations in the use of instruments. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration has a gravimeter, which has not had the opportunity to be used for a long time; if the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration wants to use it, it has to purchase another one. Anshan Iron and Steel Company also has to purchase a resistivity meter for only a few months of resistivity work this year. The value of instruments accumulated by the bureaus of the Ministry of Heavy Industry last year because they did not have the strength to use them was 5.7 billion yuan.
    The key to solving this problem lies in concentrating the existing manpower and equipment and actively strengthening leadership. In the Soviet Union, there are only two general physical prospecting leading agencies in the country—the Ministry of Geology and the Petroleum Bureau. Since the Central Geological Department of our country fully learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, it concentrated the physical prospecting teams originally scattered among various exploration teams and established a physical prospecting management office. This makes it possible to have a stronger indoor research force to cooperate with field work. Their technical level has also generally improved faster. For example, indoors, they have increased the number of experiments on new physical prospecting instrument methods and the improvement of old instrument methods from two or three to more than ten; they have also achieved good results in carrying out some experiments in the field to make the ore body more obvious, and the Daye Iron Mine was explored in this way; in terms of theoretical learning, they have collected, sorted out and translated a large number of Soviet materials, and prepared and determined experimental topics, which have timely and effectively guided field work. In addition, they have also initially established regular exploration procedures. Exploration must first carry out technical design, and after review, the task is finally determined, so the results are more significant.
    It is understood that the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, based on the experience of other departments and the suggestions of the masses, had planned to unify the physical prospecting teams of its subordinate units under the management of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration, but it has not been realized due to the disagreement between the Iron and Steel Industry Administration and the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration is worried that "if it is concentrated elsewhere, it will be inconvenient to deploy when the bureau needs it in the future." The Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration is worried that "if all the tasks of various units are put on us, the burden will be too heavy, and the work will be passive." It is not difficult to see that these "reasons" are all put forward from the standpoint of departmentalism, and therefore they are all wrong.
    The general task of the country's transition period requires that any department, any staff member, and even all machines and materials should fully play their role and maximize their potential in the cause of building a socialist motherland. Vice Premier Chen Yun once gave such instructions on the rational use of geological personnel: "We must unify dispatch within the scope of the whole country and rationally allocate according to the needs of the country." It is recommended that the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry promptly take effective measures to implement the plan to concentrate physical prospecting forces, educate relevant personnel under its jurisdiction to correct the departmentalism that only considers the convenience of their own units and disregards the overall interests of the country, so as to better play the role of physical prospecting personnel.
    Of course, there are concrete difficulties in unifying and concentrating physical prospecting forces. For example, where to concentrate? How to prevent the "inflexibility" of coordination with the work of various units after concentration? These all need further research. But as long as the units overcome departmentalism and strengthen the perspective of starting from the overall interests of the country, these problems can be solved.

    应该集中使用现有的物理探矿力量
    物理探矿是地质勘探工作中的一个重要方法。它根据矿体物理性质的差异，用科学的仪器探测地下的宝藏，和地质工作中的地表调查、钻探等配合起来，可以较经济地、较精确地确定地表以下矿体存在的情况。我国地质工作基础薄弱，而物理探矿则更是新兴的事业，较大规模地进行这一工作，只是近两三年来才开始的。因此，合理地使用现有的物理探矿力量，使其充分发挥作用并迅速提高技术水平，以适应国家建设事业的需要，是一个值得注意的问题。
    今天本报发表的两封读者来信，反映了重工业部所属物理探矿队的人力和设备没有被合理使用的情况。根据我们了解，这些情况是确实的。重工业部所属的物理探矿队从一九五零年成立以来，一直分散在有色金属工业管理局、鞍山钢铁公司、钢铁工业管理局、化学工业管理局和建筑材料工业管理局等单位。这种分散状态，对于充分发挥现有的人力物力和物理探矿技术的发展前途都是不利的。因为物理探矿技术比较复杂，工作方法和经验均未成熟，各种方法和理论、仪器和资料的研究，必须有较多的人力分工合作，在分散的状态下就没有条件进行。例如，目前鞍山钢铁公司的物理探矿工作要解决一些构造问题，就一定要用重力法、磁法和电法进行综合探测，但他们只有三个技术员，因而是无能为力的。物理探矿必须在矿床具有一定的物理和地质条件下，才能有效地起作用，因此各生产部门物理探矿任务并不一定是经常的。在分散的状态下，技术力量和仪器不能统一调拨，这样就难免浪费人力和物力。钢铁工业管理局物理探矿队的严重窝工就是人力浪费方面的一个例子。在仪器使用方面也有类似情形。钢铁工业管理局有一台重力仪，长久以来没有机会使用；有色金属工业管理局要用，又得另行购置。鞍山钢铁公司今年只有几个月的电阻法任务也要购买一台电阻仪。重工业部各局去年因为没有力量使用而积压的仪器价值五十七亿元。
    要解决这个问题，关键在于把现有的人力和设备集中使用，并积极加强领导。在苏联，全国只有两个总的物理探矿领导机构——地质部和石油局。我国中央地质部自从全面学习苏联的先进经验以后，把原来分散属于各个勘探队的物理探矿队集中起来，成立物理探矿管理处。这样就可能有较强的室内研究力量来配合野外工作。他们的技术水平一般地说也提高得较快。例如在室内，他们对于新的物理探矿仪器方法的试验和旧的仪器方法的改进，已由两三种增加到十多种；在野外进行了一些使矿体更明显表示的试验，也取得良好的成效，大冶铁矿就是这样探出来的；在理论学习方面，他们大量收集、整理和翻译了苏联的材料，准备和确定了试验题目，这些都及时而有力地指导了野外工作。此外，他们还初步建立正规的勘探程序，勘探必须先进行技术设计，经过审查，最后才确定任务，因而成绩也较显著。
    据了解，重工业部领导方面曾经根据其它部门的经验及群众建议，计划把所属各单位的物理探矿队统一由有色金属工业管理局代管起来，但是由于钢铁工业管理局和有色金属工业管理局不同意而迟迟未能实现。钢铁工业管理局是顾虑“集中到别处，今后本局工作需要时调配不方便”。有色金属工业管理局则担心“把各单位的任务都压给我们，担子太重，工作要被动”。不难看出，这些“理由”都是从本位主义思想出发而提出的，因而也都是不对的。
    国家过渡时期的总任务，要求任何一个部门、任何一个工作人员乃至一切机器物资，都应该在建设社会主义祖国的事业中充分地起作用和最大限度地发挥潜力。陈云副总理关于合理使用地质人员曾经作过这样的指示：“要在全国范围内统一调度，按国家的需要合理分配。”建议重工业部领导方面迅速采取有效措施，贯彻实施集中物理探矿力量的计划，教育所属有关人员纠正只顾本单位方便、不顾国家整体利益的本位主义思想，以便更好地发挥物理探矿人员的作用。
    当然，把物理探矿力量统一集中起来不是没有具体困难的。例如集中到哪里？怎样防止集中后对于各个单位的工作配合“不灵活”？这些都有待于进一步的研究。但只要各单位克服本位主义思想，加强为国家整体利益出发的观点，这些问题都是可以解决的。
