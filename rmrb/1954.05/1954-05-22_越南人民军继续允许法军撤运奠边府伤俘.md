    越南人民军继续允许法军撤运奠边府伤俘
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十一日讯：五月十九日，越南人民军总司令部允许法军直升飞机和海獭式飞机在奠边府机场降落，以把法国远征军的受伤战俘撤运到河内。在这一天，法军出动海獭式飞机十二架次、直升飞机六架次，运走八十一名伤俘。
      五月二十日晨，越南人民军总司令部允许法方前来再撤运了四十八名伤俘。虽然法军总司令部违反了双方的协议，对奠边府至山萝的第四十一号公路进行空袭，在距奠边府三公里的地区进行轰炸；但越南人民军总司令部在两天之内已允许法方一共撤运一百二十九名法国远征军的伤俘。
    被释放的法军伤俘在离开奠边府时，对越南人民军总司令部表示感谢，并对越南人民军的医务人员对他们的照料表示异常感激。
