Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: According to a dispatch from the Vietnam News Agency on the 29th: The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique on the achievements of the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces in eliminating more than 35,000 enemies in the Red River Delta from last December to early May, saying:

    During this winter-spring campaign, a large part of the enemy's regular army was either tied down in Dien Bien Phu or dispersed in Tuy Hoa in central and southern Vietnam and Laos. The Vietnamese People's Armed Forces in the Red River Delta took advantage of this opportunity to strengthen their activities.

    The Vietnamese People's Army has penetrated into the important strategic areas of the French army, and attacked the enemy's Gia Lam and Cat Bi airports. On Highway 5, the main artery of the French army in the Red River Delta, the Vietnamese People's Army removed or forced the enemy to abandon more than 20 strongholds, destroyed 16 trains loaded with troops and American-supplied weapons, turned many enemy-occupied areas next to this route into guerrilla areas, and constantly damaged many sections of Highway 5, hindering the enemy's transportation. The Vietnamese People's Army also sank or burned about 50 gunboats and motorboats, and destroyed nearly 1,000 various vehicles. In addition, the militia and guerrillas also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy.

    In the five months from December 1, 1953, to early May 1954, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces eliminated more than 35,000 enemy troops in the Red River Delta, accounting for nearly half of the French army's casualties on the Vietnamese battlefield during this period. In addition, the Vietnamese People's Army removed 140 French army strongholds, expanded the area of guerrilla zones and guerrilla bases by 860 square kilometers, and opened a 25-kilometer-long gap in the Day River defense system. Many guerrilla bases and guerrilla zones that were isolated before the winter-spring campaign are now connected with each other; there is contact between the right bank of the Red River and the left bank of the Red River, and between these two regions and the middle reaches of the Red River.
   
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: According to a dispatch from the Vietnam News Agency on the 29th: On May 17, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces used landmines to destroy a train fully loaded with American-supplied munitions and weapons for the French colonialists on the railway line from Haiphong to Hanoi, 11 kilometers northeast of Hai Duong, the capital of Hai Duong province.

    On the 25th, the Vietnamese People's Army intercepted a French army transport convoy on Highway 6, 21 kilometers southwest of Ha Dong, the capital of Ha Dong province, and destroyed all the vehicles in the convoy (17 automobiles).

    从去年十二月到今年五月初的五个月中
    越南人民武装在红河三角洲歼敌三万五千
    五月十七日炸毁满载美国军火的法军火车一列
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社二十九日讯：越南人民军总司令部发表越南人民武装自去年十二月到今年五月初在红河三角洲歼敌三万五千多名的战绩公报说：
    在这次冬春战役中，敌军一大部分正规军不是被牵制在奠边府，便是分散在中越南部绥和以及寮国。红河三角洲的越南人民武装利用这个机会加强了活动。
    越南人民军已经深入法军的重要战略地区，袭击了敌军的嘉林和吉碑机场。在红河三角洲法军主要的动脉第五号公路上，越南人民军拔除了或迫使敌人放弃了二十多个据点，炸毁了装载着军队和美国供应的武器的火车十六列，把这条路线旁边的许多敌占区变成了游击区，并不断地破坏了第五号公路的许多地段，使敌人交通受到了阻碍。越南人民军还击沉了或烧毁了约五十艘炮艇和汽艇，并且击毁了各种车辆将近一千辆。此外，民兵和游击队也使敌军受到重大伤亡。
    从一九五三年十二月一日到一九五四年五月初的五个月中，越南人民武装在红河三角洲歼灭了敌军三万五千多名，即将近这个时期中法军在越南战场上伤亡人数的一半。此外，越南人民军拔除了一百四十个法军据点，把游击区和游击基地的面积扩大了八百六十平方公里，并在带河防御体系中打开了二十五公里长的缺口。许多在冬春战役以前是孤立的游击基地和游击区，现在彼此有了联系；红河右岸和红河左岸之间、这两个地区和红河中游地区之间都有了联系。
   【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社二十九日讯：五月十七日，越南人民武装在海阳省省会海阳东北十一公里的从海防到河内的铁路线上，用地雷炸毁了满载美国供给法国殖民者的军火武器的火车一列。
    二十五日，越南人民军在河东省省会河东西南二十一公里的第六号公路上，截击一个法军运输队，摧毁了该队全部车辆（汽车十七辆）。
