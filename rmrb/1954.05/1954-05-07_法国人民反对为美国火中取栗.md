    French People Oppose Pulling Chestnuts out of the Fire for the United States
    By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Li Zhuang
    Judging from various signs, the discussion on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference will begin this weekend or early next week. The members attending the first meeting have been determined. The technical arrangements for the meeting are being actively carried out. The issue of restoring peace in Indochina is increasingly becoming the center of discussion in Geneva's public opinion circles and also occupies a large amount of space in Western European—especially French—newspapers.
    The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, invited by the Soviet Union and China, arrived in Geneva on the 4th. The head of the delegation, Pham Van Dong, in a statement at the airport, expressed the sincerity of the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina, stating: "The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to do everything possible to help achieve a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue." The statement also emphasized that "a particularly important task of the Geneva Conference is the issue of restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Vietnamese, Khmer, and Laotian people. This is the unanimous desire of the Indochinese people, the Southeast Asian people, and the people of the world."
    The statement of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again clarified the Republic's consistent position on restoring peace in Indochina, attracting great attention from public opinion circles here and in Western Europe. Many French newspapers published the full text of this statement.
    People all over the world hope that peace in Indochina can be restored quickly, putting an end to the world's only large-scale war currently taking place. The French people, in order to save the lives of their husbands and sons, are even more eager to end this unjust war immediately. This legitimate desire of the French people has gradually been reflected in the French parliament. According to French newspapers, the majority of French parliamentarians, "from left to right," oppose the continuation of the Indochina colonial war.
    However, when people here talk about restoring peace in Indochina, they never forget that one of Dulles's purposes in coming to Geneva is to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, expand the war there, and thereby replace France in Indochina. This new colonialist policy of Dulles has aroused the anger of French public opinion. The Paris newspaper "Combat" described Dulles as the embodiment of a "scorched earth" policy, denouncing him for coming to Geneva with a Bible in one hand and an atomic bomb in the other, "with a fantastic plan to expand the war in Asia"; after the start of the conference, he immediately "pulled out his plan to organize the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the purpose of which is to cover up American intervention in Indochina."
    Everyone knows that this Dulles, who insists on "scorching everything," has been condemned by world, especially Asian, just public opinion. However, when he left Geneva, he also stated that "Southeast Asia, where Indochina is located, is such a region where the principle of collective security should be applied, just as it has been applied with success in other regions of the world (especially Western Europe). I will continue to try to facilitate such a result." That is to say, he will never give up his conspiracy to expand the war in Indochina. According to "Lausanne Gazette," before leaving Geneva, Dulles gave Bidault an "ultimatum," stating that "the United States' attitude is firm and unchanged," and "the plans predetermined by the Western countries before the meeting are still valid." Western reporters here spread the news that Dulles will actively start establishing a Southeast Asian "collective security organization" after returning to the United States. Eisenhower, who had previously expressed hope for a so-called "temporary practical arrangement" in Indochina, publicly announced at a press conference on the 6th that a "Southeast Asian security organization" "is being established," and this fact "may have a significant impact on what will happen in Geneva when the Indochina stage is entered."
    That is to say, what the Washington authorities are currently concerned about is not ending the Indochina war, but continuing this war, using the method of organizing a "Southeast Asian security organization" to "internationalize"—expand—this war. This is the trap that the American ruling group is digging for the Geneva Conference.
    Of course, not everyone sees the danger of American policy clearly. Until now, some French figures in power have not made up their minds to break free from American control. Not long ago, they still hoped to obtain air and naval assistance from the United States and Britain to continue this war. Now, on the one hand, they want to continue this war, but they are afraid of the opposition of the French people; on the other hand, they want to seek a so-called "solution" on terms favorable to French colonialists, but they are afraid of being reprimanded by Washington. The Laniel government's attitude has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among those from all parties in the French parliament who oppose the continuation of the Indochina war. They demand that the government's policy toward Indochina be debated as soon as possible. It is said that Radical Socialist leader Mayer, who came to Geneva a few days ago for a long talk with Bidault, has taken the lead in launching this movement. News has it that French officials in power do not dare to rashly reject ceasefire proposals at present, but they will propose unacceptable ceasefire conditions, the purpose of which is to allow the war to continue.
    People remember that Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, gave an interview to the editor-in-chief of the Swedish newspaper "Expressen," Nygren, on November 26 last year, reiterating the Republic's willingness to end the Indochina war through peaceful negotiations. President Ho Chi Minh's remarks immediately received a warm welcome from people all over the world, especially the French people. More than three months after President Ho Chi Minh put forward the peace proposal, on March 5 of this year, French Prime Minister Laniel delivered a speech in parliament. While talking lavishly about peace negotiations, he put forward three "conditions" that were equivalent to asking the Vietnamese people to surrender. Laniel's "conditions" did not attract people's serious attention. French public opinion at the time pointed out that the reason he put forward these conditions, which he himself knew were impossible to achieve, was merely to respond to public opinion calling for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue.
    Today, on the eve of the official discussion of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, conspiracies against peace continue to intensify. The Paris newspaper "Libération" on May 4 revealed that those who have continued the Indochina war for seven years, bankrupted France, but benefited their own careers, are conspiring to take various destructive methods at the Geneva Conference, such as: 1. Using Bao Dai to obstruct and delay discussions; 2. Proposing conditions that are difficult for the other party to accept in order to obstruct negotiations; 3. Refusing an immediate ceasefire and delaying the process like the Korean armistice talks; 4. Waiting for an opportunity for the United States to further intervene in Indochina, etc.
    It was under such circumstances that the Laniel cabinet in France faced a crisis today. In the National Assembly, which reconvened on the 4th, the majority of parliamentarians criticized some people in power for succumbing to American pressure and lacking sincerity in peacefully resolving the Indochina issue. The mood in parliament was so intense that Laniel had to consider asking parliamentarians to hold a vote of confidence in order to get through this difficult situation. The demands of the French people could not be clearer here.
    The American rulers can say that they have supplied the French colonial army with the vast majority of its munitions and materials, and they have the "qualifications" to speak on this issue. The French people want to say that for this unjust and evil war, they have lost tens of thousands of husbands, brothers, and sons, their living difficulties are becoming increasingly serious, and France's position as a major power is increasingly declining. More and more people, including people from various strata, have realized that in this dirty war, France's role is merely to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for the American imperialists.

### 法国人民反对为美国火中取栗

    法国人民反对为美国火中取栗
    本报记者　吴文焘、李庄
    从各种迹象看来，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论，将在本周末或下周初开始。参加首次会议的成员已经确定了。会议的技术安排正在积极进行中。恢复印度支那和平的问题日益成为日内瓦舆论界谈论的中心，也占据了西欧——特别是法国报纸的很大篇幅。
    由苏联、中国邀请的越南民主共和国代表团在四日到达日内瓦。代表团团长范文同在飞机场上发表的声明，表达了越南人民和越南民主共和国政府关于恢复印度支那和平的诚意，声明说：“越南民主共和国代表团准备尽一切力量帮助实现印度支那问题的和平解决”。这个声明并着重指出：“日内瓦会议的一项特别重要的任务是在承认越南、高棉和寮国人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那和平的问题。这是印度支那人民、东南亚人民和全世界人民的一致愿望。”
    越南民主共和国代表团的声明，再一次说明了共和国关于恢复印度支那和平的一贯的立场，引起此间和西欧舆论界极大的注意。法国许多报纸都登载了这一声明的全文。
    全世界人民希望印度支那的和平能够迅速恢复，把目前世界上唯一的大规模的战争停止下来。法国人民为了挽救自己的丈夫和儿子的生命，更热望立即结束这一场不义的战争。法国人民的这种正当愿望已逐渐反映到法国的议会中。据法国报纸报道，法国的多数议员，“从左到右”，都是反对继续印度支那殖民战争的。
    但是，这里的人们在谈论恢复印度支那和平问题的时候，绝没有忘记杜勒斯到日内瓦的目的之一，是阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决，扩大那里的战争，从而在印度支那取法国而代之。杜勒斯这种新的殖民主义的政策，引起法国舆论界的愤怒。巴黎“战斗报”把杜勒斯描写成“辗平一切”的政策的化身，斥责他一手拿着圣经，一手拿着原子弹，
  “带着扩大亚洲战争的奇妙的计划”来到日内瓦；他在会议开始以后，立即“掏出他的计划，要组织东南亚公约，其目的在于掩盖美国的干涉印度支那。”
    大家知道这位坚持“辗平一切”的杜勒斯是受到了世界，特别是亚洲正义舆论的斥责的。可是，当他在离开日内瓦的时候，他还声明“印度支那所在地东南亚是这样的一个地区，在那里应该适用集体安全的原则，正如在世界上其他地区（特别是西欧）已经适用而有成就一样。我将继续设法以促成这样的结果。”这就是说，他绝不放弃扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。据“洛桑日报”透露，杜勒斯离日内瓦前，曾经交给皮杜尔一份“最后通牒”，说明“美国态度坚定不变”，“西方国家会前预定的计划仍然有效”。此间的西方记者们传出的消息说，杜勒斯返美后将积极着手建立东南亚“集体安全组织”。几天前曾经表示希望在印度支那寻求一个所谓“暂时的实际安排”的艾森豪威尔，在六日的记者招待会上就公开宣布：一个“东南亚安全组织”“正在建立中”，这一事实“可能对在日内瓦进入印度支那阶段时所将发生的事情起重大影响”。
    这就是说，华盛顿当局目前关心的并不是结束印度支那战争，而是要继续这个战争，用组织“东南亚安全组织”的办法把这个战争“国际化”——扩大化。这就是美国统治集团正为日内瓦会议挖掘的陷阱。
    当然，并不是所有的人都看清了美国政策的危险性。直到现在，某些法国的当权人物还没有摆脱美国控制的决心。他们在不久前还指望获得美国加上英国的空海军援助来继续这个战争，现在，他们一方面想继续这个战争，但又害怕法国人民的反对；另一方面又想在对法国殖民者有利的条件下寻求一个什么“解决办法”，但又害怕受到华盛顿方面的申斥。拉尼埃政府这种态度，引起了法国议会中那些反对继续印度支那战争的各党派人物的普遍不满。他们要求尽早开始辩论政府对印度支那的政策。据说，那位在几天前到日内瓦来和皮杜尔作了一次长谈的激进社会党领袖麦耶，就带头发动这个运动。有消息说，法国的当权人士目前不敢贸然拒绝停战的建议，但他们将提出不可接受的停战条件，其目的是使战争仍然继续下去。
    人们记得，越南民主共和国胡志明主席曾在去年十一月二十六日对瑞典“快报”主编尼哥发表谈话，重申共和国愿意经过和平谈判以结束印度支那战争的愿望。胡志明主席的谈话，立即获得全世界人民，特别是法国人民的热烈欢迎。在胡志明主席提出和平建议三个多月以后，即今年三月五日，法国总理拉尼埃在议会发表了一个演说，他一面奢谈和平谈判，一面提出三个等于要越南人民投降的“条件”。拉尼埃的“条件”并没有引起人们认真的注意，当时法国舆论就曾指出，他所以提出这些连自己都知道根本不能实现的条件，只不过是为了应付要求和平解决印度支那问题的舆论而已。
    今天，在日内瓦会议正式讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的前夕，反对和平的阴谋还继续加紧进行着。五月四日的巴黎的“解放报”揭露：那些把印度支那战争继续了七年之久、使法国破了产，却使他们自己的事业获得利益的人们，阴谋在日内瓦会议上采取种种破坏方法，例如：一、利用保大阻挠和拖延讨论；二、提出使对方难以接受的条件以阻碍谈判；三、拒绝立即停火，像朝鲜停战谈判一样地拖延时日；四、等待时机，使美国进一步干涉印度支那等等。
    就在这种情势下，今天的拉尼埃内阁发生了危机，在四日复会的国民议会中，多数议员斥责一些当权者屈从美国的压力，没有诚意和平解决印度支那问题。议会的情绪是这样的激烈，以致拉尼埃不得不考虑要求议员举行信任投票，以渡过这个难关。法国人民的要求，在这里表现得再清楚不过了。
    美国统治者可以说，他们供给了法国殖民军队以绝大部分的军火与物资，他们有在这个问题上发言的“资格”。法国人民却要说，为了这场不义的罪恶战争，他们已经失掉了成千上万的丈夫、兄弟和儿子，生活困难日益严重，法国作为一个大国的地位日益暮落。越来越多的包括各个不同阶层的人士已认识到：在这场肮脏的战争中，法国所起的作用，不过是为美帝国主义者“火中取栗”而已。
