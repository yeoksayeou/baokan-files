Farmers in Turpan County, Xinjiang Province, who cultivate grapes, have now completed the fertilization and vine uncovering work. All the grape vines on more than 7,690 mu of land in the county have been unearthed.

The seedless grapes produced in Turpan are favored by people of all ethnic groups. In recent years, thanks to the government's assistance to farmers in developing grape production, the county's grape output has increased year by year. The famous "Turpan White Raisins" have been selling well throughout the country. Last year, 150 tons of white raisins were exported to Czechoslovakia.

This year, in order to further increase grape production, the county government decided to cultivate grapes in Shahezi and Grape Valley (the main grape-producing areas of the county), striving to increase the yield by 24 jin per mu on the basis of last year's 236 jin per mu. Grape production in other districts and townships is required to increase by 5 percent on the basis of last year. In addition, efforts will be made to cultivate 200 mu of seedlings.

In order to complete the grape production increase task, the county party and government organs will dispatch special personnel to cooperate with the technical cadres of the Horticultural Farm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry to provide specific guidance on a series of technical improvement work for grapes in Grape Valley and Shahezi this year. Other districts and townships that mainly produce grapes are also required to cultivate high-yield models, summarize experience, and gradually promote and improve the management methods of grape production, so as to increase production.

In order to solve the difficulties in farmers' production and prevent private merchants from taking advantage of the spring famine to buy unripe grapes at low prices and engage in usury exploitation of farmers, the Turpan branch of the People's Bank of China has issued 200 million yuan in loans in grape-producing areas to help farmers solve the difficulties in production. The county supply and marketing cooperative has also advanced 100 million yuan to farmers, which not only prepares for the purchase of grapes after the autumn harvest but also solves some of the current production difficulties for farmers.

    新疆省吐鲁番农民努力争取葡萄丰收
    新疆省吐鲁番县经营葡萄的农民，目前已完成了葡萄的施肥和挖藤工作，全县七千六百九十多亩地的葡萄藤已全部出土。
    吐鲁番出产的无核葡萄，素为各族人民所喜爱。几年来，由于人民政府帮助农民发展葡萄生产，该县葡萄产量逐年提高。著名的“吐鲁番白葡萄干”已畅销全国各地。去年并有一百五十吨白葡萄干远销到捷克斯洛伐克。
    今年，该县人民政府为了进一步提高葡萄产量，决定在砂河子、葡萄沟两地（全县葡萄的主要产区）培植葡萄，争取在去年每亩二百三十六斤的基础上，提高产量二十四斤，其它区乡葡萄产量，要求在去年的基础上提高百分之五。另外争取育苗二百亩。
    为了完成葡萄增产任务，该县党政机关将抽调专人配合农林厅园艺场技术干部，分别在葡萄沟、砂河子两地对今年葡萄一系列的技术改进工作进行具体指导；对其它以产葡萄为主的区乡，也要求分别培养丰产典型，总结经验，逐渐推广，改进葡萄生产的经营管理办法，争取提高产量。
    为了解决农民生产中的困难，防止私商利用春荒以低价买青和对农民进行高利贷剥削，中国人民银行吐鲁番支行已在产葡萄地区，发放了两亿元贷款，帮助农民解决生产中的困难。县供销合作社也以一亿元资金预支给农民，不但给秋后收购葡萄工作做了准备，而且也解决了农民当前生产上的部分困难。
