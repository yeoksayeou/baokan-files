Geneva Correspondence

    Let the Korean People Solve Their Own Problems
    By our correspondents Li Zhuang and Du Bo
    It has been nearly a month since the Geneva Conference began discussing the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. However, due to the rigid attitude of the United States in refusing to negotiate, the conference has not made much progress. From the first day the conference entered into discussion, Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a practical and feasible rational proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, in nearly four weeks of discussions, the representatives of the United States, Syngman Rhee, and other countries that sent troops to participate in the Korean War simply and unreasonably opposed Nam Il's proposal without putting forward any proposals for discussion, which brought the conference into a time-consuming and argumentative stalemate. In order to expedite the resolution of the Korean issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made new and constructive efforts at the eleventh meeting of the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue on May 22. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made a supplementary proposal to Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal of April 27, namely, when holding all-Korea elections under free conditions excluding foreign interference, a neutral nations supervisory committee should be established to assist the all-Korea committee in conducting all-Korea elections in accordance with the all-Korea election law and to supervise the all-Korea elections. Foreign Minister Nam Il stated that he fully agreed. Because this new supplementary proposal conforms to the solemn principles of the Korean people freely expressing their will and non-interference in Korean internal affairs, and takes into account the existing special circumstances in North and South Korea, inviting neutral countries to assist in the all-Korea elections creates new conditions for a reasonable solution to the Korean issue.
    The spirit of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's entire speech and proposal, like his previous two speeches on the Korean issue, firmly advocates that the unification of Korea should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and that no foreign forces should interfere in Korean internal affairs. The rationality of this proposition is undeniable. Therefore, the regular withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea before the all-Korea elections is a prerequisite to ensure that the Korean people freely express their will during the elections.
    As everyone knows, the U.S. military, the so-called United Nations forces, came from thousands of miles away to fight in the Korean War and were the invading foreign army, while the Chinese People's Volunteers were helping the Korean people resist American aggression in order to defend the peace and security of their own country. In principle, the U.S. military should withdraw from Korea unconditionally first, but in order to expedite the resolution of the Korean issue, the Korean and Chinese sides fairly and reasonably advocated the simultaneous withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the U.S. military. The United States even opposes such a reasonable proposition to this day, fully demonstrating that it has no sincerity in resolving the Korean issue and is determined to prevent Korea from being unified on the basis of independence, peace, and democracy.
    Taking into account the actual differences between North and South Korea in terms of political, economic, and social systems, and the exacerbation of North-South Korean relations caused by the war, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai supports Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal of April 27 that the major political parties and social organizations of North and South Korea send representatives to form an all-Korea committee on the principle of equality between the two sides, and formulate an all-Korea election law based on the principle of unanimous consultation to ensure the democratic nature of the all-Korea elections. Due to the current actual situation in North and South Korea, problems can only be solved on the basis of equal consultations and unanimous agreement between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the South Korean regime. Otherwise, one side's will will be imposed on the other, and the result will be unworkable. The three-year Korean War has shown that the United States has joined forces with the armies of a dozen countries, used all modern equipment, and spent tens of billions of dollars, but still has not realized the plan to impose the Syngman Rhee regime on North Korea. The composition of the All-Korea Committee has nothing to do with the population ratio; representatives are only generated according to the population in the election vote. The United States and the Syngman Rhee government deliberately confuse the two in order to cover up their fear of conducting truly free elections in all of Korea.
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's supplementary proposal to establish a neutral nations supervisory committee to assist the All-Korea Committee responsible for implementing all-Korea elections is also to ensure that the Korean people enjoy full democratic and free rights during the elections, and to protect them from the threats of foreign forces and local regimes and terrorist groups. This supplementary proposal removes the last excuse for those who believe that the antagonism between North and South Korea makes it difficult to reach an agreement and to conduct elections. It also makes the opinions against organizing an all-Korea committee to preside over matters related to national elections completely untenable, the opinions advocating UN supervision of elections completely untenable, and there is no reason for foreign troops to stay in Korea.
    In order to enable Korea to achieve national unification on the basis of independence, peace, and democracy, it is very important for countries most concerned about peace in the Far East to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. With this guarantee, the recurrence of the Korean War can be avoided after all foreign troops withdraw from Korea. Because the Korean people do not want war, and without foreign intervention and support, the Syngman Rhee group would never dare to launch a war again. The Korean armistice is currently unstable, and Syngman Rhee recently shouted under the direction of the United States that he would "advance north regardless of the Geneva Conference." It can be seen that the Korean armistice still has the danger of being broken. Only by reaching an agreement on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference and jointly guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea by major powers can the armistice be consolidated. The Soviet and Chinese delegations have already declared at the Geneva Conference that they are willing to undertake this solemn task, but the United States, Britain, and France have remained silent on this issue. On the 22nd, the South Korean representative openly declared at the meeting that his government was fundamentally opposed to the guarantee of the peaceful development of Korea by major powers, and could only accept the guarantee of the United Nations, that is, the United States, the belligerent party. This means that the Syngman Rhee group wants the United States to guarantee its reunification of Korea by force. The so-called U.S.-ROK mutual defense treaty signed after the Korean armistice is such a guarantee.
    People remember that in the eleven discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, the countries that invaded Korea, headed by the United States, never put forward a proposal that could be called a plan. Recently, the United States held many
  "Sixteen-Nation Secret Meetings" and repeatedly promoted that it had forced Syngman Rhee to
  "compromise." Now this so-called "compromise" has been revealed to the world. This is the so-called fourteen-point proposal put forward by Pyun Yung-tae at today's conference. This "proposal" shows that it is not a "compromise" at all, but a concrete embodiment of the absurd claim that the United States has always insisted on imposing the Syngman Rhee regime on North Korea.
    As a mouthpiece for the United States, Pyun Yung-tae routinely made a boring slander at the meeting on the 22nd. If you compare the fourteen "proposals" put forward by Pyun Yung-tae with Pyun Yung-tae's past "speeches," you will find that there is nothing new in them. Although there are so many articles, there is only one plan, that is: to continue to extend the Syngman Rhee regime to North Korea, to continue to refuse the withdrawal of the American invading army from Korea, to continue to require the "United Nations" to supervise the elections, and to continue to oppose the guarantee of the peaceful development of Korea by relevant countries, especially major powers.
  In a word, it is to turn Korea into an American colony and war base, and to oppose the Korean people from establishing an independent, peaceful, unified, and democratic country according to their own will.
    Everyone knows that the United Nations has long been discredited on the Korean issue. Who doesn't know that the Korean War was launched by the United States in the name of the United Nations? Who doesn't know that the United States has exhausted all means of threats and inducements, including not giving "aid" and even the ugly things of "embargoing cotton and sulfur" in manipulating the UN voting machine to pass illegal resolutions on the Korean issue? Who doesn't know that all actions of the American generals who invaded Korea under the banner of the United Nations are only responsible to the American authorities, and the United Nations only has "stamping and retroactive approval"? Shortly after the United Nations organization was raped and illegally recognized the United States' interference in the Korean War and its occupation of Taiwan, Dean Rusk, then Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, said: "There is no great organization at Success Lake. When we (meaning the United States) refer to the United Nations, we mean ourselves."
    It is very clear that the reason why the United States is eager to use the United Nations as a talisman to obtain the right to supervise the Korean elections is to do whatever it wants in Korea unscrupulously. In 1948, it "supervised" the election of Syngman Rhee, turning South Korea into a colony. Now it wants to expand Syngman Rhee's puppet rule to North Korea in the name of elections, so as to encompass the entire Korea. Although the United States' conspiracy is vicious, it is a pity that it cannot deceive anyone.
    If you expose this conspiracy of the United States, it is not difficult to understand why the United States stubbornly refuses to withdraw the occupying forces. Because without the support of American bayonets, the Syngman Rhee group would not be able to stand for a day. According to Pyun Yung-tae himself, they would have no clothes to wear and no food to eat. The United States and the Syngman Rhee group are so afraid of withdrawing the occupying forces and so afraid of a truly free election without UN supervision because they know that if the people are given a truly free election without foreign interference, the likes of Syngman Rhee are destined to be spurned by the people. Even reporters from Western bourgeois newspapers have said this many times.
    It is precisely for this reason that the representatives of the United States and Syngman Rhee have constantly opposed Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal on the establishment of an all-Korea committee based on equal consultation in the past, and when Foreign Minister Zhou put forward the reasonable proposal of the neutral nations supervisory committee at the meeting on the 22nd, they hurriedly and rudely rejected it. At the press conference held today, the spokesman of the US delegation showed an unusually rigid attitude. When reporters asked him whether the United States thought it could consider Zhou Enlai's proposal, his answer was "no."
    The four-week Geneva Conference fully exposed the United States' old idea of refusing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. They are determined not to let the Korean people solve their own problems. However, the people of the world, the people of Asia, and especially the Korean people will resolutely continue to work hard to promote the Geneva Conference to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 让朝鲜人民解决自己的问题

    让朝鲜人民解决自己的问题
    本报记者　李庄　杜波
    从日内瓦会议开始关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，到现在将近一个月了。可是，在美国方面拒绝协商的僵硬态度下，会议一直没有能够获得多大的进展。从会议进入讨论的第一天起，南日外务相就提出了一个和平解决朝鲜问题的切实可行的合理建议，但是在将近四个星期的讨论中，美国、李承晚代表以及其他出兵参加侵略朝鲜战争的国家的代表只是一味毫无理由地反对南日的建议，而又没有提出任何可供讨论的建议来，这就使会议陷入费时的争论的僵局中。为使朝鲜问题迅速解决，我国周恩来外长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相，在五月二十二日日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的第十一次会议上作了新的建设性的努力。周恩来外长对南日外务相四月二十七日的建议提出一个补充建议，即在排除外国干涉的自由条件下举行全朝鲜选举时，成立一个中立国监察委员会，协助全朝鲜委员会根据全朝鲜选举法进行全朝鲜选举，并对全朝鲜选举进行监察。南日外务相发言时，表示完全同意。由于这个新的补充建议既符合于朝鲜人民自由表达其意志和外力不干涉朝鲜内政的庄严原则，又照顾了南北朝鲜现存的特殊情况，邀请中立国家来协助进行全朝鲜的选举，这就对朝鲜问题的合理解决创造了新的条件。
    周恩来外长的整个发言和建议的精神，和他前两次关于朝鲜问题的发言一样，坚决主张朝鲜的统一问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决，任何外力不得干涉朝鲜的内政。这个主张的合理性是不可否认的。因此，在全朝鲜进行选举之前，定期从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，是保证朝鲜人民在选举时自由表达意志的先决条件。
    大家知道，美国军队即所谓联合国军，在朝鲜战争中是不远千里而来的交战的一方，是侵略朝鲜的外国军队，而中国人民志愿军是为了保卫自己祖国的和平安全，援助朝鲜人民抵抗美国的侵略的。按理来说，美国军队应首先无条件地退出朝鲜，但是为了使朝鲜问题的迅速解决，朝中方面公平合理地主张中国人民志愿军与美国军队同时撤退。美国至今连这样合理的主张也反对，充分说明了它没有诚意使朝鲜问题得到解决，决心要使朝鲜不能在独立、和平与民主的基础上统一起来。
    照顾到南北朝鲜在政治上、经济上和社会制度方面存在着实际的差异，和由于战争所引起的南北朝鲜关系的尖锐化的实际情况，周恩来外长支持南日外务相四月二十七日的建议，由南北朝鲜的各大政党和社会团体按双方平等的原则，派出代表组织一个全朝鲜委员会，根据一致协商的原则，制定全朝鲜选举法，以保证全朝鲜选举的民主性。由于目前南北朝鲜的实际状况，只有在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜政权平等协商一致同意的基础上，才能解决问题，否则即是将一方的意志强加于他方，其结果是行不通的。三年的朝鲜战争，已表明美国纠合十几个国家的军队，使用了所有现代化的装备，消耗了以百亿计的美元，仍然没有实现将李承晚的政权强加于北朝鲜的计划。全朝鲜委员会的组成与人口比例问题无关，只有在选举投票中才是按人口产生代表。美国和李承晚政府故意把两者混淆起来，为的是掩盖他们害怕在全朝鲜进行真正的自由选举。
    周恩来外长补充建议设立中立国监察委员会，对负责实行全朝鲜选举的全朝鲜委员会加以协助，也是为了保证朝鲜人民在选举时得到充分的民主自由权利，使之免受外力和地方政权和恐怖集团的威胁。这个补充建议解除了那些认为南北朝鲜的对立使协议难于达成和选举难于进行的人们的最后一个借口，这样也使那些反对组织全朝鲜委员会主持有关全国选举事宜的意见完全站不住脚了，那些主张联合国监督选举的意见也完全站不住脚了，外国军队驻留朝鲜更没有任何理由了。
    为使朝鲜能够在独立、和平与民主的基础上实现全国的统一，由最关心远东和平的国家保障朝鲜的和平发展是十分重要的。有了这种保证，在一切外国军队撤出朝鲜以后，就可以避免朝鲜战争的再起了。因为朝鲜人民是不愿意战争的，没有外国的干预和支持，李承晚集团决不敢重新发动战争。现在朝鲜停战是不稳定的，李承晚最近还在美国指使下叫喊他将“完全不顾日内瓦会议而北进”。可见朝鲜停战仍然有被破坏的危险，只有在日内瓦会议上取得解决朝鲜问题的协议，并由各大国共同保证朝鲜的和平发展，才能巩固停战。苏联和中国代表团已经在日内瓦会议上声明愿意承担这个庄严任务，可是美英法方面对这个问题至今保持沉默。而二十二日南朝鲜代表在会上公开宣称：他的政府根本反对各大国保障朝鲜和平发展，只能接受联合国即交战一方美国的保证。这就是说，李承晚集团要的是美国保证它武力统一朝鲜。在朝鲜停战后签订的所谓美韩共同防御条约，就是这样的保证。
    人们记得，在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的十一次讨论中，以美国为首的侵朝国家始终提不出一个称得上是方案的建议来，最近美国召开了许多次
  “十六国秘密会议”，并一再宣扬已迫使李承晚
  “妥协”，现在这种所谓“妥协”已大白于世，这就是它在今天大会上通过卞荣泰提出的所谓十四点建议。这个“建议”表明，它并不是什么“妥协”，而是把美国一贯坚持的要把李承晚政权强加于北朝鲜的荒谬主张具体化了。
    作为美国的传声筒，卞荣泰在二十二日的会议上照例进行一通无聊的诽谤。如果把卞荣泰所提出的十四点“建议”和卞荣泰过去的“发言”比较一下，人们就会发现这里面没有任何新的东西。条数尽管那样多，但其中只有一个打算，那就是：继续要把李承晚政权推广到北朝鲜，继续拒绝美国侵略军从朝鲜撤退，继续要“联合国”监督选举，继续反对有关国家特别是大国保证朝鲜的和平发展。
  一句话，就是要把朝鲜变为美国殖民地和战争基地，反对朝鲜人民按自己的意志建立一个独立、和平、统一、民主的国家。
    谁都知道，在朝鲜问题上联合国早已弄得声名狼藉了。谁不知道朝鲜战争是美国盗用联合国的名义发动的；谁不知道在操纵联合国的表决机器通过有关朝鲜问题的非法决议上美国是用尽了威胁利诱，包括不给“援助”，甚至“禁运棉花和硫磺”的丑事；谁不知道打着联合国旗子侵略朝鲜的美国将军们的一切行动只对美国当局负责，而联合国只有“盖章追认”呢？就在联合国组织被奸污，而非法承认美国干涉朝鲜战争并强占我国台湾以后不久，美国当时的助理国务卿第安·鲁斯克就说：“在成功湖并没有什么伟大的组织，当我们（按即美国）指联合国时，我们就指的我们自己”。
    十分显然，美国所以急图利用联合国这个护身符取得监督朝鲜选举的权利，就是为了在朝鲜肆无忌惮地为所欲为。一九四八年它“监督”选出李承晚，把南朝鲜变成殖民地，现在更想假选举之名，把李承晚的傀儡统治扩大到北朝鲜，从而囊括朝鲜全部。美国的阴谋虽然狠毒，但是非常可惜，它是骗不过任何人的。
    戳穿美国这个阴谋，就不难理解美国为什么这样顽固地拒绝撤退占领军了。因为没有美国刺刀的支持，李承晚集团一天都站不住脚。照卞荣泰自己所说，他们也就没有衣服穿，就没有饭吃。美国和李承晚集团这样害怕撤退占领军，这样害怕没有联合国监督的真正的自由选举，是因为他们知道给了人民以真正没有外力干涉的自由选举，李承晚之流是注定要被人民所唾弃的。这点连西方资产阶级报纸的记者们都已不知说过多少次了。
    仅仅因为这个缘故，所以美国和李承晚的代表在过去就不断反对南日外务相关于成立以平等协商为基础的全朝鲜委员会的建议，而当周外长在二十二日的会议上提出的中立国监察委员会的合理建议时，就迫不及待地悍然加以拒绝。在今天举行的记者招待会上，美国代表团发言人更表现了与众不同的僵硬态度。当记者们追问他，美国是否认为可以考虑周恩来的建议时，他的回答是“不”。
    四个星期的日内瓦会议，充分暴露了美国拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题的老主意，他们坚决不让朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题。但是，全世界人民、亚洲人民特别是朝鲜人民将坚决地继续努力，力促日内瓦会议能对朝鲜问题的和平解决有所贡献。
