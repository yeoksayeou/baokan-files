    The lives of the working people in the capitalist world are deteriorating as international monopoly capital increasingly intensifies its efforts to guarantee maximum capitalist profits by exploiting and bankrupting the majority of its own residents, by enslaving and continuously plundering the people of other countries, especially backward countries, and by engaging in war and the militarization of the national economy.

    The continuing arms race in capitalist countries has accelerated the impoverishment of the working people in these countries. The direct military expenditures of the fourteen member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reached as high as 63 billion US dollars in the fiscal year 1952-53, an increase of two and a half times compared to the 18 billion US dollars in 1950, and continues to increase. In the fiscal year 1953-54, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the total budget expenditure in the United States, 42 percent in the United Kingdom, and 33 percent in France. Eisenhower's budget proposal to the US Congress for the fiscal year 1954-55 allocates 85 percent to military expenditures; the United Kingdom's direct military expenditure for the fiscal year 1954-55 also accounts for 36.3 percent of the new total budget expenditure. Italy's military expenditure in the fiscal year 1953-54 reached 600 billion lire, accounting for 27.7 percent of the national budget. In Asia, countries that follow the US war policy, such as Japan, spent 70 percent of the total budget on military-related expenditures in 1953. Thailand's national budget in 1953 allocated more than half of the total national income to maintaining the military, police, and constructing military bases, and repeatedly added military appropriations.

    The enormous military expenditure is mainly squeezed from the working people. The tax burden on the people of capitalist countries is becoming increasingly heavy. According to US press reports, 25 to 50 percent of the income of most families in the United States today is taken away by taxes, and the average tax payment per person has increased from 69 US dollars in 1939 to 550 US dollars in 1953. Eisenhower's so-called tax reduction measures actually shift part of the tax burden of monopoly capitalists onto the working people. At the beginning of 1953, the taxes borne by the British people were already twice as high as before World War II, with taxes accounting for 42 percent of the people's income. Due to the continued hopeless war in Indochina, France's total tax revenue accounted for 43 percent of the entire national income. The sharp increase in taxes in other Western European countries is also quite astonishing, with Belgium's taxes equivalent to 8.9 times those before the war. In Japan, tax revenue in 1952 also accounted for 29.5 percent of the total national income.

    The frantic arms race and the continuous shrinking of civilian industries have worsened the economic situation in capitalist countries, and unemployment is becoming increasingly serious. In the United States, the economic crisis is deepening, and the number of fully and partially unemployed people has reached 15 million. In recent months, the total number of unemployed in the United States has continued to rise. According to the US government's obviously greatly reduced figures, the number of unemployed in February increased sharply by 1,026,000, creating a new high in three years. In twelve major Western European countries, according to official figures, the number of fully unemployed people was 2,959,000 in 1948; by April 1953, this number had reached 4,300,000.

    In Latin America, due to the serious exploitation and control by US monopoly capital, the economies of many countries are deteriorating. Cuba, with a population of nearly six million, has more than 800,000 unemployed, and 500,000 to 700,000 sugarcane plantation workers are actually in a state of semi-unemployment year-round, able to work only three to five months a year. In Paraguay, out of more than 1.4 million residents, 350,000 have to go abroad to make a living because they cannot find work in the country.

    In Asia, unemployment is particularly serious in many countries. Due to the Yoshida government's pursuit of the US-formulated rearmament policy and the implementation of so-called "enterprise rationalization" measures, enterprises have been laying off workers in large numbers. Since last autumn, the number of unemployed in Japan has continued to surge, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed has reached 13 million. In the Philippines, out of a population of 22 million, 8.5 million are unemployed; in Ceylon, the current number of unemployed has reached over 300,000; even in Lebanon, with a population of only one million, there are 65,000 unemployed.

    The living conditions of the "lucky ones" who have work in capitalist countries are also deteriorating. As the economic crisis deepens, the cost of living in various capitalist countries is generally rising, and the real income of the working people is decreasing. From September 1947 to September 1953, the cost of living in the United States rose by 20 percent. According to US official statistics in 1950, a quarter of families in the United States had an annual income of less than 2,080 US dollars, and one-ninth of families had an annual income of less than 1,000 US dollars, which are only one-half and one-quarter of the official standard of minimum living expenses; 80 percent of families in the United States had insufficient income to maintain a minimum standard of living. In the United Kingdom, the prices of ten major foods increased by an average of 60 percent from October 1951 to January 1954, and the real wages of workers have decreased by 20 percent compared to before World War II. Many working-class families cannot even afford the rationed food. In France, the cost of living index in Paris alone has increased by about 36 times since 1938, and workers' real wages are only 30 to 40 percent of what they were before the war. In Italy, the cost of living index in May 1953 was equivalent to 57 times that of 1938. In Japan, the cost of living index rose by 26.7 percent in 1953 alone, while the wage index decreased by 4.3 percent. The rule of the United States and the Rhee Syngman government has brought extreme poverty to the people of South Korea. Prices in South Korea today have increased to 8,030 percent compared to 1947, and the worker wage index has decreased to 27 percent of that in 1947.

    In order to pursue insatiable high profits, monopoly capitalists are constantly using various hypocritical excuses and high-pressure tactics to strengthen the labor intensity of the working people and carry out cruel exploitation. In the ten major industries in the United States, due to the implementation of the so-called "speed-up system," output per hour has increased by 30 percent since 1946. Workers' working hours are also constantly being extended. According to statistics from the US Department of Commerce, 4.5 million Americans work an average of 10 to 12 hours a day; 2,072,000 people have to work 12 to 15 hours a day; and 300,000 people have to work more than 15 hours a day. In colonies and dependencies, most working people toil in rubber plantations, tea plantations, rice paddies, and mines for 14 to 18 hours a day. As a result of this cruel exploitation, coupled with the deterioration of working conditions, labor accidents have increased dramatically. In 1952, in the United States, 74 workers died or were injured for every million tons of steel produced; in the United Kingdom, there were 56,400 accidents and 848,500 cases of occupational disease in April of last year alone; in France, one worker dies every hour, four workers are disabled, and 1,000 workers are injured; in Italy, about 600,000 people lose their ability to work each year due to serious injuries at work; in Japan, an average of two people die every hour due to accidents, and four people are disabled every minute due to injuries.

    The governments of capitalist countries, which serve monopoly capital, completely disregard the living conditions of the working people. Of the 72.1 billion US dollar budget expenditure in the United States in the fiscal year 1953-54, only more than 300 million US dollars were used for social welfare programs such as unemployment relief; France spends less than one-tenth of its war expenses in Vietnam on public health in one year; in Turkey, expenditures on public health and social welfare programs are less than 6 percent of military expenditures. Therefore, the housing and health conditions of the vast working people in capitalist countries are extremely poor. In the United States, more than 20 percent of the residents' housing in major cities is slums, and these slums house 33 percent of the population of these cities. In France, 7 million people live in substandard housing. According to French newspapers, there are 170,000 slum dwellings in Paris alone, and another 140,000 that are absolutely uninhabitable. In Italy, there is a shortage of 6 million homes, and more than 3 million people have to live in cellars and caves. In West Germany, the housing problem for 5 million people remains unresolved. In colonies and dependencies, the health conditions of the working people are even more tragic. In the Union of South Africa, 60 percent of the children of colored farmers and workers' families do not live to the age of 18. The mortality rate of children in Kenya and Algeria has reached the terrible levels of 50 percent and 67 percent.

    The increasingly frenzied attacks by monopoly capitalists on the living standards and political rights of the working people will inevitably be met with increasingly fierce resistance from the working class and all working people. Since the beginning of this year, the strike struggles of the working people in capitalist countries have continued to flourish. Dockworkers in New York, USA, persisted in a three-week strike in March, bringing work in the Port of New York to a near standstill; workers in France held a 24-hour general strike on April 28, demanding increased wages, relief, and annuities; hundreds of thousands of people in West Germany demanded higher wages and improved living conditions; the Japan Government and Public Workers' Union Council, with 1.8 million members, decided to launch a struggle movement from spring to summer to defend the economic and political rights of employees. All these facts show that the workers' movement in capitalist countries is rising. Their struggle to improve their lives and defend their union rights has become a powerful force in the movement to defend peace.

    资本主义世界劳动人民的日益贫穷化
    朱伦璋
    由于国际垄断资本愈来愈加紧地用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民，特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用进行战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证他们最大限度的资本主义利润，资本主义世界的劳动人民的生活正日益恶化。
    资本主义各国继续进行扩军运动加速了这些国家劳动人民的贫穷化。北大西洋公约集团十四个成员国一九五二—五三年度的直接军事费用高达六百三十亿美元，比一九五○年的一百八十亿美元增加了两倍半，而且继续有增无减。在一九五三—五四年度，美国的军事支出占整个预算支出的百分之七十三，英国占百分之四十二，法国占百分之三十三。艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出的一九五四—五五年度的预算，军事费用占到百分之八十五；英国一九五四—五五年度的直接军费也占了新预算总支出的百分之三十六点三。意大利一九五三—五四年度的军费高达六千亿里拉，占国家预算百分之二十七点七。在亚洲，追随美国战争政策的国家，如日本一九五三年度有关军事性的开支占了总预算的百分之七十。泰国一九五三年的国家预算，用在维持军队、警察和修筑军事基地的费用占了全部国家收入的半数以上，而且还一再追加军事拨款。
    庞大的军事开支，主要是从劳动人民身上搜刮而来的。资本主义各国人民的捐税负担愈益加重。据美国报刊报道，美国今天大多数家庭的收入有百分之二十五到百分之五十被捐税刮去，平均每个人的纳税额已从一九三九年的六十九美元增加到一九五三年的五百五十美元。艾森豪威尔的所谓减税措施实际上是把垄断资本家的一部分捐税负担转到劳动人民的身上。一九五三年初，英国人民负担的捐税已为第二次世界大战前的两倍，赋税占去了人民百分之四十二的收入。由于继续进行无望的印度支那战争，法国的赋税总额占到整个国民收入的百分之四十三。其他西欧国家赋税激增的情况也是十分惊人的，像比利时的捐税就已相当于战前的八点九倍。在日本，一九五二年的税收，也占了全部国民收入的百分之二十九点五。
    疯狂的扩军备战，民用工业的不断萎缩，使资本主义国家的经济情况恶化，失业现象日益严重。在美国，经济危机正在日益发展，全失业和半失业的人数已达一千五百万人。最近几个月来，美国失业总数接连上升，据美国政府宣布的显然大大缩小了的数字，二月份失业者骤增了一百零二万六千人，造成三年来新的最高数目。在西欧十二个主要国家里，根据官方的数字，一九四八年完全失业的人数为二百九十五万九千人；到一九五三年四月，这数目已达到四百三十万。
    在拉丁美洲，由于受到美国垄断资本的严重剥削和控制，许多国家的经济日益恶化。近六百万人口的古巴就有八十多万失业者，而且有五十万到七十万的甘蔗种植园工人实际上也是长年处于半失业状态，他们每年只能做三个月到五个月的工作。在巴拉圭，一百四十多万居民中，就有三十五万人因为在国内无法找到工作而不得不到国外去谋生。
    在亚洲，许多国家的失业现象尤其严重。由于吉田政府奉行美国制订的重新武装的政策，实行所谓“企业合理化”措施，各企业大批解雇工人，日本自去年秋天以来失业人数继续激增，失业者与半失业者的数目已达一千三百万人。菲律宾二千二百万人口中，失业的就占八百五十万人；锡兰目前的失业人数已达三十万以上；连人口仅有一百万的黎巴嫩，也有六万五千人失业。
    在资本主义国家中有工可做的“幸运儿”，生活情况也是愈来愈恶化。由于经济危机的加深，各资本主义国家的生活费用普遍地节节上涨，劳动人民实际收入愈来愈减少。从一九四七年九月到一九五三年九月，美国生活费用就上涨了百分之二十。根据美国官方一九五○年的统计，美国就有四分之一的家庭每年收入不到二千零八十美元，有九分之一的家庭每年收入不到一千美元，这些数字仅及官方所定标准的最低生活费用的二分之一和四分之一；美国有百分之八十的家庭收入不足以维持最低的生活。在英国，十种主要食品的价格从一九五一年十月到一九五四年一月平均上涨了百分之六十，工人的实际工资已比第二次世界大战前减少了百分之二十。许多劳动人民家庭连配给的食品都买不起。在法国，仅巴黎一地的生活指数自一九三八年以来已增高了约三十六倍，工人实际工资只合战前的百分之三十到四十。在意大利，一九五三年五月的生活指数已等于一九三八年的五十七倍。在日本，一九五三年一年中，生活费指数就上涨了百分之二十六点七，而工资指数却下降了百分之四点三。美国和李承晚政府的统治给南朝鲜人民带来了极度的贫困，南朝鲜今天的物价比起一九四七年来上涨到百分之八千零三十，工人工资指数降低到一九四七年的百分之二十七。
    垄断资本家为了追求贪得无厌的高额利润，不断以各种虚伪的借口和高压的手段来加强劳动人民的劳动强度，进行残酷的剥削。在美国十个主要工业中，由于实行所谓“赶快制度”，自一九四六年以来每小时产量增加了百分之三十。工人的工作时间也不断被延长。据美国商务部的统计，有四百五十万美国人民平均每天工作十小时到十二小时；有二百零七万二千人每天要工作十二小时到十五小时；有三十万人每天要工作十五小时以上。在殖民地和附属国里，劳动人民大部分每天在橡胶园、茶园、稻田、矿山作苦工都要作十四至十八小时。这种残酷剥削的结果，加以劳动条件的恶化，劳动事故惊人地增加。在一九五二年，美国每生产一百万吨钢就有七十四个工人死亡或受伤；在英国去年四月一个月中就发生了五万六千四百起事故和八十四万八千五百桩职业病；在法国每小时就有一个工人死亡，四个工人残废，一千个工人受伤；在意大利每年因在工作中受重伤而失去工作能力的大约六十万人；在日本每小时平均有两个人因事故而丧命，每分钟有四个人因受伤而残废。
    资本主义各国替垄断资本服务的政府，对于劳动人民的生活条件是完全置之不顾的。美国一九五三—五四年度七百二十一亿美元的预算支出中，只有三亿多美元用于失业救济等社会福利事业上面；法国一年内用于公共卫生方面的经费还不到用于侵越战费的十分之一；在土耳其，公共卫生和社会福利事业方面的支出还不到军费支出的百分之六。因此，资本主义各国广大劳动人民的居住情况和健康情况都极端恶劣。在美国，各大城市的居民住屋中有百分之二十以上是贫民窟，而这些贫民窟却住着这些城市的百分之三十三的人口。在法国，有七百万人所住的房屋不合标准，据法国报纸透露，仅巴黎一地即有贫民窟住所十七万所，另有十四万所已绝对不合人们居住。在意大利，缺少六百万幢住宅，有三百多万人不得不住在地窖和山洞里。在西德，有五百万人的住宅得不到解决。在殖民地和附属国里，劳动人民的健康情况则更加悲惨。南非联邦的有色人种的农民和工人家庭的孩子活不到十八岁的占百分之六十。怯尼亚和阿尔及利亚儿童的死亡率已达到百分之五十和百分之六十七的可怕的程度。
    垄断资本家对劳动人民生活水平和政治权利的日益疯狂的进攻，必然地遭到工人阶级和全体劳动人民愈来愈猛烈的反抗。今年以来，资本主义各国劳动人民的罢工斗争继续蓬勃地展开。美国纽约的码头工人在三月里坚持了三星期的罢工，使纽约港的工作几乎完全陷于停顿；法国的工人在四月二十八日举行了一次二十四小时的大罢工，要求增加工资、救济金和年金；西德有数十万人要求提高工资改善生活；日本拥有一百八十万会员的日本官公厅工会协议会决定展开一个从春季到夏季的斗争运动来捍卫职工的经济和政治权利。这一切事实都说明了资本主义国家的工人运动正在日益高涨。他们为争取改善生活和保卫工会权利而进行的斗争，已成为保卫和平运动的一支强大力量。
