    Guangdong's coastal areas have seen widespread bumper harvests during this year's spring fishing season. According to preliminary statistics, from January to April this year, the coastal areas of the entire province caught approximately 1.2 million dan of various marine fish, generally an increase of 15% to 20% compared to the same period last year. The first quarter fishery production in the central Guangdong region nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. In the western Guangdong region, the Naozhou Port only caught 3,909 dan of fish during the spring and summer seasons last year, while this year, in January and February alone, it has already caught 4,481 dan.

    Fishery production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions, due to collective labor involving more trips to sea, more nets cast, and improved techniques, have generally achieved even greater production increases compared to individual fishermen. For example, the Second Fishery Production Cooperative of Zhabo Port in Yangjiang County caught more than 250 dan of fish within twenty days in April, setting the highest production record for Zhabo Port this April. The Qiangcao Mutual Aid Team in Nanmenwai Township, Huilai County, caught a total of 270,000 jin of fish in the first quarter of this year, approximately four times the output of the same period last year. The Liang Li Mutual Aid Team of Chixi Yongkou in Taishan County was not yet organized at this time last year. Because everyone worked independently, they ended up competing for fish schools, scattering them. Each boat caught a maximum of only 23 dan of fish. This spring, due to organization, they overcame the "grabbing" phenomenon, and each boat caught an average of 43 dan of fish, an increase of 87% compared to last year.

    Now that the off-season for fishery production has arrived, coastal fishermen are actively preparing for off-season production, striving to make the off-season not so lean.

    广东省沿海大春海渔汛普遍丰收
    广东省沿海今年大春海渔汛普遍丰收。据初步统计，今年一月到四月全省沿海共捕到各种海水鱼约达一百二十万担左右，一般都比去年同期增产百分之十五至二十。粤中区今年第一季渔产约比去年同期增加了一倍；粤西区的硇洲港去年春夏两季只捕鱼三千九百零九担，今年仅一、二两个月就已捕到四千四百八十一担。
    各地渔业生产合作社和互助组，由于集体劳动多出海、多下网和改进技术，普遍比个体渔民增产更多。如阳江县闸波港第二渔业生产合作社于四月份二十天内，捕鱼二百五十多担，创造了闸波港今年四月份生产的最高纪录。惠来县南门外乡?艚互助组，今年第一季共捕鱼二十七万斤，约等于去年同期产量的四倍。台山县赤溪涌口梁立互助组，去年这个时候还没有组织起来，由于各干各的，结果发现了鱼群就你抢我夺，赶散了鱼群，每船最多只捕到二十三担鱼，而今春由于组织起来，克服了“抢捕”的现象，每船平均捕鱼四十三担，比去年增加百分之八十七。
    现在渔业生产的淡季已经到来，沿海渔民正积极准备淡季生产，争取淡季不淡。
