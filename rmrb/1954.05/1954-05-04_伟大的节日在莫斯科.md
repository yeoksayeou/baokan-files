    Great Holiday in Moscow
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
  The Soviet people spent the May Day holiday with joyful hearts. On this day, the Soviet people reviewed their strength in creating a communist society and safeguarding world peace under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    This was the best day in Moscow's weather since the beginning of spring. Sunshine shone on the capital, dressed in festive attire – Soviet national flags, the May Day slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Soviet party and government leaders were hung all over the walls of the buildings. From ten in the morning to four in the afternoon, people's hearts were drawn to Red Square, and people gathered in Red Square. Here, in front of the leaders of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, a grand review of the power of the people was held.
    The parade lasted about an hour. People saw the powerful strength of the Soviet people in defending their country and safeguarding peace. When various arms of the military marched in neat steps across Red Square, when large eagle-like and swallow-like jet planes flew in groups over Red Square, people watched excitedly and applauded enthusiastically.
    The mass parade lasted nearly five hours, forming a giant stream of people. Many children also participated in the parade on their parents' shoulders. People marching read the slogan "Forward to the Victory of Communism!" under the kind Lenin and Stalin portraits on the walls of the State Department Store. The flags in their hands formed a red forest, and they waved bouquets towards the party and government leaders on the reviewing stand. They carried huge bundles of grain, Youth League membership cards for those going to reclaim new land, fabrics, and flower baskets, demonstrating their determination to greatly increase agricultural products, daily necessities, and build a better life.
    The marchers held up banners saying "Salute to the fraternal Chinese people," "Salute to the People's Republic of China," and portraits of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and other communist parties of various countries, shouting the slogan "Long live the great Chinese people," overflowing with the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
    After hundreds of thousands of people held the May Day review, tens of thousands of people gathered at the "Dynamo" Stadium to watch sports performances, and tens of thousands of others participated in mass entertainment in various parks.
    In the evening, when night fell, Moscow put on a pearl shirt made of countless electric lights, and people seemed to have entered a beautiful fairy tale world. The Moscow University on Lenin Hills and the city's various buildings were brightly lit, looking like crystal palaces from afar. In the square in front of the Grand Theatre, people could see the words "Give Peace to the World" written in lights on the wall of the Central Department Store. Millions of residents seemed to have poured into the streets. Red Square was crowded with people.
    I followed the people and waited for the most beautiful moment: ten o'clock sharp. Dozens of searchlights shone into the sky. The strong light sometimes looked like giant pillars supporting the sky, and sometimes like white rainbows rotating like a revolving lantern. While the searchlights illuminated the sky, red, green, and various colored lights were set off everywhere. They rose into the air like strings of grapes and fell down like pots of orchids. At the same time, above the red star of the Kremlin, a portrait of Lenin and Stalin appeared in mid-air, also illuminated by searchlights.
    The crowd carried me to Gorky Street. The globe at the entrance of the General Post and Telecommunications Bureau was rotating, and Lenin and Stalin flags woven with lights were fluttering on the globe. The lights on the roof of the General Bureau sometimes wove into words:
  "Long Live May Day," "The Soviet Union is a Fortress of Peace," "We Fight for World Peace"; sometimes forming other words:
  "Glory to the Soviet Motherland," "Implement the Resolutions of the 19th Party Congress," "Forward to the Victory of Communism." The slogans "Glory to the Soviet People" shone on both sides of Pushkin Square, and the slogans on the roof of the Izvestia newspaper building were constantly changing, all woven with lights. People strolled on Gorky Street. Children followed their parents, reading the light slogans reflecting the Soviet people's efforts. Young people sang cheerful songs in unison. Small groups of men and women talked and laughed freely. For a full hour or two, vehicles could not pass on Gorky Street, and it became a temporary park road.
    Until late at night, people who were creating and building a new society with their own labor were still in joy.

### 伟大的节日在莫斯科

    伟大的节日在莫斯科
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李　何
  苏联人民以欢乐的心情度过“五一”节。这一天，苏联人民检阅了自己在苏联共产党领导之下创造共产主义社会、卫护世界和平的力量。
    这是入春以来莫斯科天气最好的一天。阳光普照着穿着节日盛装的首都——各建筑物墙上遍挂苏联国旗、苏联共产党中央“五一”节口号、列宁、斯大林和苏联党政领导者的画像。从上午十点到下午四点，人们的心向往着红场，人们汇集在红场。在这里，在苏联共产党和政府领导者的面前，举行了巨大的人民的力量的检阅。
    阅兵式进行了约一个钟头。人们看到了苏联人民保卫国家、捍卫和平的强大力量。当各式兵种以整齐的步伐走过红场时，当大鹰似的、飞燕似的喷气式大小飞机成群结队掠过红场上空时，人们兴奋地注视着，并热烈地鼓掌。
    群众游行进行了将近五个钟头，形成人的巨流。许多儿童也坐在父母的肩膀上参加游行。游行的人们在国营百货公司墙上慈霭的列宁、斯大林画像下面读着“向共产主义的胜利前进！”的口号。他们手中的旗帜构成红色的森林，并向检阅台上党政领导者挥着花束。他们抬着巨大的禾束、到新地开荒去的青年团团证、布匹、花篮，表现了要大大提高农产品、日用品和把生活建设得更加美好的决心。
    游行的人们举着“向兄弟的中国人民致敬”，“向中华人民共和国致敬”的标语，举着中国共产党以及其他各国共产党领袖的画像，喊着“伟大的中国人民万岁”的口号，洋溢着无产阶级国际主义的精神。
    几十万群众举行了“五一”检阅以后，成千成万的人聚集在“狄纳莫”运动场观看体育表演，另有成千成万人在各个公园参加群众娱乐。
    晚间，当夜幕下垂，莫斯科换上用无数盏电灯组成的珍珠衫的时候，人们好像进入了美丽的童话世界。列宁山上的莫斯科大学和全市各个大厦灯火辉煌，远望宛如水晶宫一样。在大戏剧院前面的广场上，人们可以看到中央百货商店墙上用灯光写的“给世界以和平”的大字。几百万居民好像都涌到街上来了。红场上人挨着人，挤得水泄不通。
    我随着人们在等待最美丽的时刻：十点钟正。几十道探照灯射向天空。强烈的灯光时而像撑托苍穹的巨柱，时而像走马灯式旋转的白虹。在探照灯照亮天空的时候，四处放起红的绿的各色灯花。它们像一串串葡萄升上半空，又像一盆盆兰花落下去。和这同时，在克里姆林宫红星的上面，在半空中出现一幅列宁、斯大林像，也是用探照灯照亮的。
    人流把我带到高尔基街。邮电总局门端的地球仪在转动着，地球上飘扬着灯光织成的列宁、斯大林旗帜。总局墙顶的灯光一会儿织成字样：
  “‘五一’万岁”、“苏联是和平堡垒”、“我们为世界和平而斗争”；一会儿组成另外字样：
  “苏维埃祖国光荣”、“执行党第十九次代表大会决议”、“向共产主义的胜利前进”。普式庚广场两旁照耀着“苏联人民光荣”的标语，消息报报馆屋顶上标语不断更换着，也都是用灯光织成的。人们在高尔基大街漫步着。儿童跟着父母念着反映苏联人民努力方向的灯光标语。年青的人们合唱着愉快的歌曲。三五成群的男男女女自由自在地谈笑着。整整一两个钟头，高尔基大街上车辆通行不得，它变成一条临时的公园内马路。
    直到夜深，用自己的劳动创造和建设着新社会的人们还在欢乐中。
