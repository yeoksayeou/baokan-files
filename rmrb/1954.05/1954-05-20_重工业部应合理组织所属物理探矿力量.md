The Physical Prospecting Team of the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau:
Work is Unsupervised and Technical Progress is Very Slow

Letters from Gu Zhenjin, Ouyang Zongqi, Wang Jilun and other technicians of the Physical Prospecting Team of the Geological Exploration Company of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: The physical prospecting organization of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has been established for three and a half years, but technical progress is very slow. Prospecting work has not been able to effectively play its due role, and it is far from meeting the requirements of national construction. The reason for this is that the Ministry of Heavy Industry disperses the small number of technical personnel and equipment among its subordinate bureaus and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and each unit has to develop its own system. Therefore, our team's technical force has been busy with on-site operations and on-site production management for several years. A few people go out in the spring and return in the winter, and there is no possibility of exploration design and comprehensive research. Little has been done in terms of inference of physical prospecting results, research on the structural principles of instruments, and summarization and improvement of working methods. In this way, the technical level will naturally not improve. In the past three years, we have only done magnetic and natural current methods, and we have no ability to research and master other more effective methods. Due to the decentralized organizational structure, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has provided almost no technical leadership to us in the past few years. The direction of technical development and the solution of technical problems all depend on our own exploration. Even the prospecting tasks are actively requested from the geological personnel by ourselves. There is no physical prospecting design in the geological design of the entire bureau, and no one cares about the specific methods. For example, this year the bureau chief said: A certain mine is a key national investment, and physical prospecting must be included. As for how to include it, everyone is clueless. In this way, work often cannot be carried out according to the characteristics, methods, and procedures of physical prospecting, resulting in blind spending of money with little effect. And our work results reports are not taken seriously.

Administratively, we are also often in a state of being unmanaged. For example, in 1950, the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration sent physical prospecting personnel to other units to study, and later these people were affiliated to a mining office that was completely different in nature from physical prospecting. Last year, the physical prospecting team was merged into the Geological Exploration Company of the bureau. In name, it was under the leadership of the company's geological section, but in reality, the geological section did not care, and the physical prospecting team had to develop its own system. Because the Central Geological Exploration Company is a management department, the physical prospecting team and the company's administrative units are inconsistent in terms of administrative management and financial expenditure. Therefore, the company's leadership, starting solely from the company's own situation and without considering the characteristics of the physical prospecting team that it should not be dispersed, decided this year to disperse the prospecting team to various administrative regions.

Physical prospecting is an emerging cause that needs careful support, and the current decentralized environment is not conducive to it. The effective way to give full play to the existing manpower and material resources is to concentrate the personnel and instruments scattered in various units, and manage, research and use them in a unified manner. The Central Geological Department has already made good achievements in this regard. We sincerely hope that the leading comrades will consider our opinions again from the perspective of the overall and long-term interests.

The Physical Prospecting Team of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration:
Personnel are Long-Term Idle and a Large Number of Equipment is Backlogged

A letter from Yang Erxu, a technician of the Physical Prospecting Team of the Resource Exploration Headquarters of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: At a time when the country is starting large-scale economic construction, and when geological work is far behind the requirements of construction, a strange phenomenon is occurring here - geological workers are idle for a long time, and a large number of instruments and equipment are backlogged. What is particularly surprising is that the relevant leading cadres turn a blind eye to this. Instead of trying to end or reduce these unreasonable phenomena as soon as possible, they allow them to continue for a long time.

Our physical prospecting team has seven technicians, ten trainee technicians, and one trainee. There are also a lot of instruments, including: two torsion balances, one gravimeter, sixteen magnetic balances, one resistivity meter, and several natural current method instruments. However, since 1952, we have had little work to do. Last year, we completed our prospecting task with about one-twelfth of our strength. Because everyone was idle, we had to send more than a dozen comrades to other units to study. Two technicians have already "changed careers." Despite this, there are still too many people, so the technicians have to set up tripods. Throughout the year, we only used two magnetic balances, one resistivity meter, and natural current method instruments; two torsion balances, one gravimeter, and fourteen magnetic balances were not used.

Why is this happening? Mainly because the central task of our Resource Exploration Headquarters last year was to investigate refractory clay; and the physical prospecting team is currently unable to do anything about refractory clay.

What about this year? This year, our task is still very small, only enough for two months of work for the entire team. So, we had to include a "standby fee" in the plan. We have repeatedly raised objections to the higher authorities about this matter. But regrettably! The bureau chief's answer to us was: "The phenomenon of being idle is inevitable during the period of large-scale national economic construction," and he told us to "understand our thinking."

Is it "inevitable" that the physical prospecting team is currently idle? No, from the national situation, it is definitely not the case. The physical prospecting teams of the Central Geological Department and the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry have more work than they can do, and as a result, they have to reduce part of their tasks. Obviously, the key to solving this problem is not to "understand" our "thinking," but to understand the departmentalism of certain leading comrades in the Iron and Steel Industry Administration.

### 重工业部应合理组织所属物理探矿力量

    重工业部应合理组织所属物理探矿力量
    有色金属管理局物理探矿队
    工作无人领导技术进展很慢
    重工业部有色金属工业管理局地质勘探公司物理探矿队技术员顾振津、欧阳宗圻、王继伦等来信：重工业部有色金属工业管理局的物理探矿机构成立已经三年半，但技术进展很慢，探矿工作还不能有效地发挥应有的作用，还远远不能满足国家建设的要求。究其原因，主要是重工业部把为数不多的技术人员和仪器设备分散在所属各局和鞍山钢铁公司，各个单位都要自搞一套。因此，我队的技术力量几年来忙于现场操作和现场生产管理等方面，少数几个人春天出去，冬天回来，根本谈不上勘探设计和综合研究，对于物理探矿结果的推断、仪器构造原理的研究、工作方法的总结和提高等也做得很少。这样，技术水平自然提不高。过去三年来我们只做过磁法和自然电流法，对其他更有效的方法还无力去研究和掌握。由于组织机构分散，几年来，重工业部对我们几乎没有技术领导。技术发展的方向和技术问题的解决，全靠自己摸索。甚至连探矿任务也由我们主动地向地质人员要，整个局的地质设计中就没有物理探矿设计，具体作法就没有人过问。例如今年局长说：某矿山是国家投资重点，物理探矿一定要摆进去。至于怎样摆进去，大家都心中无数。这样往往就不能按物理探矿的特性和方法、程序进行工作，形成盲目花钱，效果不大。而我们工作的成果报告，也不被重视。
    在行政上，我们也经常处于无人管理状态。例如一九五零年有色金属工业管理局把物理探矿人员送到别的单位学习，后来又把这些人隶属于一个性质和物理探矿完全不相同的矿业处。去年，又把物理探矿队合并于局里的地质勘探公司，名义上属于公司的地质科领导，但实际上地质科不管，物理探矿队只好自搞一套。因为中央地质勘探公司是个管理部门，物理探矿队和公司各行政单位无论在行政管理和财务开支等方面都不一致。因此，公司的领导方面单纯从公司本身的情况出发，而不根据物理探矿队不宜分散使用的特点，决定今年把探矿队分散到各个行政区去。
    物理探矿工作是一个新兴的事业，它需要加意的扶植，而目前分散的环境对它是不利的。有效地发挥现有的人力、物力的方法，是把分散在各单位的人员和仪器集中起来，统一管理、研究和使用。中央地质部在这方面已经做出了很好的成绩。我们恳切地希望领导同志从整体和长远的利益出发，虚心严肃地再一次考虑我们的意见。
    钢铁工业管理局物理探矿队
    人员长期窝工设备大批积压
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局资源勘探总队物理探矿队技术员杨尔煦来信：在国家开始大规模经济建设时期，在地质工作远远落后于建设要求的情况下，我们这里却出现着一种怪现象——地质工作人员长期窝工，仪器设备大批积压。尤其令人惊异的是，有关领导干部对此熟视无睹，他们不是想方法尽快地结束或减少这些不合理现象，相反地却听任其长此下去。
    我们这个物理探矿队共有七个技术员，十个见习技术员和一个练习生。仪器也不少，计有：扭秤二台，重力仪一台，磁秤十六台，电阻仪一台，自然电流法仪器数台。可是自从一九五二年以来，我们一直没有什么工作可做。去年全年的探矿任务，我们约用十二分之一的力量就完成了。因为大家呆着无事可做，只好派十几个同志到其他单位学习。有两个技术员已经“改行”了。尽管这样，人员还是太多，于是技术员也只好去摆三角架。整整一年，我们只动用过二台磁秤，一台电阻仪和自然电流法仪器；有二台扭秤、一台重力仪和十四台磁秤均未经使用过。
    为什么会这样呢？主要因为我们资源勘探总队去年的中心工作是调查耐火黏土；而对于耐火黏土，物理探矿队目前是无能为力的。
    那么今年呢？今年我们的任务仍然很少，只够全队两个月的工作量。于是只好在计划中列入一笔“窝工费”。为了这件事，我们屡次向上级提意见。可是遗憾得很！局长给我们的回答是：“窝工现象在国家大规模经济建设时期是不可避免的”，要我们“打通思想”。
    是不是物理探矿队目前的窝工是“不可避免的”呢？不是的，从全国的情况来看决不是这样。中央地质部和重工业部有色金属工业管理局的物理探矿队工作多得做不完，结果只好减削一部分任务。显然，解决这个问题的关键不在于“打通”我们的“思想”，而是要打通钢铁工业管理局某些领导同志的本位主义思想。
