Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 17th (Shen Jiantu, Special Correspondent) reports: After the active proposals of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet delegation accelerated progress towards the restoration of peace in Indochina, the restricted conference on the Indochina issue began on the 17th. At the same time, news from the United States and France said that the French diplomatic note requested "direct high-level negotiations" between Washington and Paris on the issue of U.S. intervention. This news inevitably makes people doubt whether the Laniel government is sincere in seeking rapid progress at the conference.

    The Paris "Liberation" pointed out: "In two weeks, the French government has asked the United States for the second time to consider intervention in the Indochina war. Moreover, the French government has even requested negotiations to discuss this intervention without waiting for the Geneva Conference to reach a conclusion." French public opinion anxiously recognizes that holding such negotiations on U.S. intervention while the restricted conference is working hard to find a solution will seriously hinder the progress of the conference.

    The proceedings of the restricted conference will not be published, but it is expected that comments will be made on Eden's five questions. Foreign Minister Molotov said at the last meeting that the Soviet delegation would certainly express its attitude. But he pointed out, "It is inappropriate to narrow things down to just these questions and to let go of the military and political issues that have already been raised by the development of the situation in Indochina."

    French newspapers have vehemently criticized Bidault's attempt to limit his proposals to military issues and exclude political aspects. Some French newspapers believe that this indicates an unwillingness to seek a solution, and even if Bidault has to agree to a ceasefire due to public pressure, it will only be to gain a respite. "L'Humanité" pointed out that Bidault "continues to seek not peace but a respite. He hopes that the stringent measures formulated by Laniel will take effect during this respite, especially during this period Dulles can prepare public opinion in the United States for direct intervention and lay the foundation for the U.S. aggression system in Southeast Asia."

    Another important issue to be discussed at the restricted conference is the issue of international supervision of the implementation of the armistice agreement. Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's eight-point proposal has made it possible for both sides to obtain a glorious armistice. The implementation of the agreement to cease hostilities can be guaranteed by the neutral country supervision committee proposed by Foreign Minister Molotov. The experience of the Korean armistice has shown that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is an appropriate body to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement, despite U.S. attempts to eliminate the role of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    Other countries must also express their attitude towards this Soviet proposal and the Soviet Union's acceptance in principle of France's next proposal. The Soviet Union's acceptance in principle of the French proposal is that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference provide guarantees for the agreements reached, but if there is any violation of the agreement, these countries should consult with each other in order to take collective measures.

    "The New York Herald Tribune" has shown that the United States is interested in the fact that any country providing guarantees proposed by France can take "appropriate measures" to punish actions that violate the agreement. Observers here pointed out that this is nothing more than opening the door for any country providing guarantees (like the United States) to continue and expand the war under the pretext of "violating the agreement."

    The recent U.S. attempt to intervene in the Indochina war through the so-called U.S.-French talks shows that Dulles has not learned a lesson from his recent "diplomatic failure" before the opening of the Geneva Conference. He is一心只想拼凑东南亚侵略集团借 the name of "collective security." But Asian observers here have seen that the U.S. plan is actually to exclude those Asian countries that are unwilling to be ruled by the U.S. and is directed against them. The direct purpose of his aggressive bloc is to expand the war in Indochina.

    The attention of people all over the world is now focused on the restricted conference, which will determine whether to achieve peace in Indochina or continue the war. Obviously, the restricted conference can only make progress if both parties have the sincerity to seek a solution. The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China have all expressed their willingness to seek a solution and have taken a series of positive steps in this regard. Now it depends on whether the French delegation can resist the pressure from the United States, which is intensifying its intervention, and realize the desire of the French people to stop the hostilities and restore peace in Indochina.

    新华社记者评印度支那问题限制性会议
    【新华社日内瓦十七日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：在越南民主共和国代表团和苏联代表团的积极的建议加速了向着恢复印度支那和平的方向的进展以后，讨论印度支那问题的限制性会议在十七日开始了。与此同时，美国和法国的消息说，法国的外交照会要求华盛顿和巴黎之间就美国实行干涉的问题举行“直接的高级谈判”，这个消息使人们不免要怀疑拉尼埃政府是否有诚意在会议上谋求迅速进展。
    巴黎“解放报”指出：“在两个星期内，法国政府已经是第二次要求美国考虑干涉印度支那战争了。而且，法国政府甚至已经要求不等日内瓦会议得出结果来就举行谈判，讨论这种干涉。”法国舆论焦虑地认识到：在限制性会议正努力谋求解决的时候，举行这种关于美国干涉的谈判会严重地阻碍会议的进展。
    限制性会议的经过情形将不公开发表，不过预料将就艾登的五个问题发表评论。莫洛托夫外长在上次会议上说，苏联代表团当然是要表示它的态度的。但是他指出，“把事情缩小成为仅仅这样一些问题，而放过印度支那的事态发展所已经提出的一些军事性和政治性的问题，这是不适宜的。”
    法国各报猛烈抨击皮杜尔想使他的建议只限于军事问题而排除政治方面的企图。某些法国报纸认为这表示不愿意谋求解决，即使皮杜尔由于公众的压力而不得不同意停火，那也只会是为了获得一个喘息的机会。“人道报”指出，皮杜尔“继续谋求的不是和平而是喘息的机会，他希望在这个喘息时期内拉尼埃所制定的严峻措施能够发生作用，尤其是在这个时期内杜勒斯能够在美国为直接干涉准备舆论，并为美国在东南亚的侵略体系奠定基础。”
    限制性会议所要讨论的另一个重要问题，是对停战协定的履行实行国际监督的问题。范文同代理外长的八点建议，已使得双方都有可能获得光荣的停战。停止敌对行动的协定的履行，可以由莫洛托夫外长建议成立的中立国监督委员会来保证。朝鲜停战的经验已经说明，中立国监察委员会是监督停战协定的履行的适当机构，尽管美国企图取消中立国监察委员会的作用。
    其他国家对于苏联的这个建议以及苏联在原则上接受法国下一建议这一点，还必须表明态度。苏联在原则上接受法国的建议，就是：由参加日内瓦会议的国家对于取得的协议提供保证，但如有任何违反协议情事，应由这些国家进行磋商，以便采取集体的措施。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”已经显示，美国对于法国所提的任何提供保证的国家都可以采取“适当的措施”来惩罚违反协议的行动这一点感到兴趣。这里的观察家指出：这无非是替任何提供保证的国家
  （像美国）打开方便之门，以便以“违反协议”为借口继续和扩大战争。
    最近美国企图通过所谓美法会谈来干涉印度支那战争，这说明杜勒斯还没有从他最近在日内瓦会议快要开幕以前所遭受的“外交失败”中得到教训，他一心只想借“集体安全”的名义拼凑东南亚侵略集团。但是这里的亚洲观察家们都已看出：美国的这种计划实际上是要把那些不愿意受美国统治的亚洲国家排斥在外，并且是针对着它们的。他的侵略集团的直接目的是要扩大印度支那的战争。
    全世界人们的注意现在都集中在限制性会议上，这种限制性会议将决定在印度支那是实现和平还是继续战争。很明显，只有双方都有谋求解决的诚意，限制性会议才可能有进展。越南民主共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国的代表团都已表示愿意谋求解决，并已在这一方面采取了一系列的积极步骤。现在就要看法国代表团是否在要加紧进行干涉的美国压力之下不屈服而实现法国人民要求在印度支那停止敌对行动和恢复和平的愿望了。
