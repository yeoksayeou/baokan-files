    The Duty of Honor
    Mu Abidova, Teacher at Pushkin Middle School, Turmin Village, Ordzhonikidze District, Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR
    The elderly often tell us young people about the lives of the Uzbek people before the revolution. Poverty, lack of rights, ignorance, and disease were the fate of the working people in our border regions before the Great October Revolution.

    In that terrible period, there was no school, no hospital, and not a single literate person in Turmin Village. The poor died of hunger. All the farmers had to work for four landlords, and all the land belonged to these bloodsuckers. The poor rented a small piece of land to cultivate, and then had to give three-quarters of the harvest to those fat rich men. The people's lives were hard. And the plight of Uzbek women was even more tragic: they were slaves of the landlords and slaves in their own families.

    We recall these things more than once in the school classroom when we study the past and present of our country. Now all the students are watching how our village is getting better and better.

    Every collective farm member has a good house, and every family has solid furniture, "Ilyich" lamps, radios, bicycles, and sewing machines. Many workers have cars or motorcycles. Now all the children in the village are studying without exception. We have five schools: one middle school, three seven-year schools, and one primary school. Our village's agricultural labor cooperative "Kyzyl-Uzbekistan" has built a clubhouse with a theater that can accommodate nine hundred people; it has built its own radio station, sanatorium, and cinema. There is a library, clinic, maternity hospital, pharmacy, five kindergartens, and several nurseries for collective farm members. Now all the farmers in our village are literate. We have our own intellectuals—more than a hundred teachers, two doctors, a midwife, and many other medical workers, two agronomists, a breeder, and a veterinarian. Most of them are from our village, and more than half of them are women.

    In the fraternal family of the various free republics of our vast multi-ethnic country, our sunny Soviet Uzbekistan is growing and prospering year by year. We are building new factories, hydroelectric power stations, and canals, beautiful houses and cultural palaces, sanatoriums and sports fields every year. The land of the collective farms is cultivated with the latest machines, which our dear government has given us and are increasing day by day. Life is becoming richer and happier.

    How happy you feel when you see all this! You want to work better, more stubbornly fulfill your honorable duty, and dedicate all your strength and knowledge to the noble cause of educating the growing generation—the future builders of communist society.
　　Could Uzbek women before the October Revolution have really dreamed of these great rights that have been given to us now? My parents are ordinary farmers who have now become knowledgeable people, which is only possible under the Soviet regime. I entered school at the age of seven, received a ten-year education, and then graduated from the Tashkent Normal College. Now I have been a teacher at Pushkin Middle School in Turmin for three years. I teach the Uzbek language and literature of my own people, and at the same time continue to improve my knowledge. This year, I will complete my studies in the correspondence course of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Tashkent Normal University.

    I love my profession as a teacher and the courses I teach in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades very much. When I was still in middle school, I liked literature and linguistics. At that time, I decided that I would definitely teach this course in the future and dedicate my life to this cause.

    I am very pleased to hear the comments of other teachers, the principal, and the academic director of our school, who say that I have mastered the complex teaching skills of being a teacher not badly. Watching my students grow, they are becoming more and more fascinated by reading Russian and Uzbek writers, such as Pushkin, Tolstoy, Gorky, Alisher Navoi, Hamza Hakimzade, and other classical writers. Girls and boys are also enthusiastically reading writers from other Soviet republics, great Chinese writers and writers from other people's democratic republics, as well as Western classical writers.

    Several literary groups in our school are doing well and are successful. We often organize parties and book clubs. How enthusiastically our students prepare for them! For example, a grand party commemorating Pushkin's works was held on the eve of the New Year. Umule Kurbanova, an eighth-grade girl, made an excellent opening speech. Many other girls and boys recited poems and excerpts from novels and novellas by this great Russian poet in Uzbek and Russian. A book club about the Uzbek writer Rakhmat Faizi's novel "Spring Comes to the Prairie" was held not long ago. This novel depicts the selfless struggle of young people to reclaim the vast land of the "Hungry Steppe" and build new prosperous oases on these deserts.

    Currently, our school, like other schools in the country, is preparing for exams, which is a particularly busy period. All our teachers are working together to help lagging students catch up and to enable students to acquire the most complete knowledge. We organize collective and individual tutoring for students, review the courses we have taught, and widely use examples and teaching materials for this purpose.

    Among our young villagers, fifty-five are studying at universities in Moscow, Leningrad, Tashkent, Samarkand, and other cities in the country. The day is fast approaching when many young men and women from our Turmin Village will graduate from our middle school and go to various places to continue their studies, so as to receive higher education and become agronomists, engineers, doctors, teachers—experts in various departments of the national economy and culture.

    In the happy Soviet country, the work of a teacher is pleasant and honorable!

    荣誉的职责
    苏联乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国  奥尔忠尼启则区土尔明村普希金中学教员  穆·阿比多娃
    老年人常向我们青年人讲一些关于革命前乌兹别克人民的生活情况。贫困、无权利、愚昧、疾病这就是伟大的十月革命以前我们边区劳动人民的命运。
    在那个可怕的时期，在土尔明村没有一所学校，没有医院，也没有一个识字的人。穷人们在饥饿中死去。所有的农民都要为四个地主做工，全部土地都是这些吸血鬼的。穷人们租来一小块土地耕种，然后就要把收获的四分之三交给那些养得肥肥的富翁。人民的生活是艰苦的。而乌兹别克妇女的遭遇更是悲惨：她们是地主的奴婢，也是自己家庭里的奴婢。
    我们在学校的课堂上，当我们研究我国过去和现在的情况的时候，不只一次地回忆起这些事。现在全体学生眼看着我们的村庄是怎样地变好了。
    每一个集体农庄庄员都有一所很好的住房，每一个家庭都有着牢固的家具、“伊里奇”灯、收音机、自行车和缝纫机。许多劳动者有了小汽车或摩托车。现在村里的所有的孩子都毫无例外地在学习。我们有五所学校：中学一所、七年制学校三所和小学一所。我们村的农业劳动组合“克兹尔—乌兹别克斯坦”建筑了一所俱乐部，其中有能容九百人的剧场；建筑了自己的无线电分站、休养所和有声电影院。为集体农庄庄员们设有图书馆、诊疗所、产院、药房、五所幼儿园和好几处托儿所。现在我们村的全体农民都是识字的。我们有自己的知识分子——一百多位教师、两位医生、一位助产士和许多其他医务工作人员、两位农学家、一位饲养员、一位兽医士。他们大部分都是我们同村的人，其中一半以上是妇女。
    在我们辽阔的多民族国家的各自由共和国的兄弟般的家庭里，我们的阳光普照的苏维埃乌兹别克斯坦逐年地成长与繁荣。我们每年都在建设一些新的工厂、水电站和运河，美丽的住宅和文化宫，疗养院和运动场。集体农庄的土地是用最新的机器耕种，它们是亲爱的政府送给我们的，而且日益增多。生活变得越来越富裕，越来越快乐了。
    当你看到这一切的时候，心里是多么快乐啊！愿意更好地工作，更顽强地完成自己荣誉的职责，把自己的全部力量和知识献给教育正在成长的一代——共产主义社会未来的建设者——这一崇高事业。　
　难道十月革命前乌兹别克妇女真的能够幻想到现在所赋予我们的这些伟大权利吗？我的父母是普通的农民，现在已经成为有知识的人了，这只有在苏维埃政权下才有可能。我从七岁开始就进入了学校，受到了十年制学校的教育，然后又由塔什干师范专科学校毕业，现在在土尔明的普希金中学已作了三年教师。我教授本族的乌兹别克语言和文学，同时也继续提高自己的知识，在今年就要完成塔什干师范大学语文系函授班的学习。
    我非常喜爱我作教师的职业和在六、七、八年级里所担任的课程。当自己还在中学学习的时候，我就喜欢文学和语言学。那时候我就决定将来一定讲授这门课程，并把毕生精力都献给这一事业。
    我非常愉快地听我们学校的其他教师、校长、教务主任对我的评论，他们说，我对于作教师的复杂的教学技巧掌握的还不坏。眼看着我的学生们在成长着，他们愈来愈醉心于阅读俄罗斯和乌兹别克作家们，如普希金、托尔斯泰、高尔基、阿里什拉、那沃依、哈姆兹·哈基姆——扎杰和其他古典作家们的作品。女孩子和男孩子们也是兴致勃勃地阅读其他苏维埃共和国的作家、伟大的中国作家和其他各人民民主共和国的作家们以及西方的古典作家们的作品。
    我们学校的几个文学小组的工作都作得很好，而且是有成绩的。我们经常组织晚会和读书会。我们的学生是以多么大的兴味来准备它们啊！譬如说，在新年的前夕举行了一次纪念普希金的创作的盛大晚会。八年级女学生乌木烈·库尔巴诺娃作了一个极好的开幕词。其他许多女孩子和男孩子们用乌兹别克语言和俄罗斯语言朗诵了这位伟大俄罗斯诗人的诗和长篇小说以及中篇小说的片断。关于乌兹别克作家拉赫马塔·法兹的长篇小说“春天来到了草原”的读书会，刚刚举行过不久。在这部小说里，描写了青年们为开垦“饥饿”草原的广阔土地、为在这些荒漠上建立起新的繁荣的绿洲而进行的忘我斗争。
    目前在我们的学校里，就像在国内其他各个学校一样正在进行考试的准备工作，这是一个特别忙碌的时期。我们全体教师都在一致努力使落后的学生赶上去，使学生获得各种最完备的知识。我们为学生组织了集体辅导和个别辅导，复习讲过的课程，为此并广泛地使用实例教材。
    我们年青的同村人中，已有五十五名在莫斯科、列宁格勒、塔什干、撒马尔汗以及国内其他各城市里的大学学习。我们土尔明村的许多男女青年从我们中学毕业的日子又快到来了，他们要到各地去继续学习，以便受到高等教育，从而成为农学家、工程师、医生、教师——国民经济和文化各部门的专家。
    在幸福的苏维埃国家里，教师的劳动是愉快的和荣誉的！
