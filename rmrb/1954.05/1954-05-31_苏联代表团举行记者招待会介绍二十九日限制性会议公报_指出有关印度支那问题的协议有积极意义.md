    苏联代表团举行记者招待会介绍二十九日限制性会议公报
    指出有关印度支那问题的协议有积极意义
     【新华社日内瓦三十日电】二十九日，在九国代表团开过讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的会议之后，苏联代表团新闻处举行了一个记者招待会，报告日内瓦会议情况。
    苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫在记者招待会上宣读了二十九日会议上一致通过的公报，引起了记者们的很大兴趣。
    苏联代表团发言人在回答记者们所提出来的许多问题时特别指出，公报中所谈到的会议参加者在一些有关印度支那问题的问题上达成的协议，对于今后会议的工作具有积极的意义。
    伊利切夫在回答一个问题时说，公报中所列举的已经达成协议的几点是经过各国代表团初步详细讨论并取得协议的。在二十九日的会议以前，苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫和英国代表团首席代表艾登举行了几次会谈。在这几次会谈中，他们研究了公报中所提到的问题，其中包括苏联代表团还在开始举行秘密会议讨论印度支那问题时就提出来的关于双方司令部代表在日内瓦和当地进行接触这样一个重要问题。苏联代表团提出这一建议的出发点是：鉴于所讨论的问题的复杂性，有必要由双方司令部的代表在日内瓦和当地进行接触。
