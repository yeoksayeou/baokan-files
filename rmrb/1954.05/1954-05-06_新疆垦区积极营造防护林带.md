The Xinjiang reclamation area is actively constructing shelterbelts. Each reclamation area has initially formulated specific plans for afforestation and nursery cultivation. Some reclamation areas have also surveyed the routes for shelterbelts and demarcated the ranges of the belts. The Urumqi, Manas, and Hami reclamation areas plan to afforest 11,000 mu this year. The Aksu reclamation area plans to create various shelterbelts covering more than 7,900 mu over the three years from 1953 to 1955, and plans to cultivate 6.5 million seedlings. Currently, it has cultivated 3.5 hectares of seedlings including Russian olive, peach, and apricot, and more than 1.8 million branches and rootstocks. In the plan for constructing shelterbelts, each reclamation area also plans to create field protection forest belts in cultivated areas and cultivable but uncultivated areas according to different situations; to create dike protection forest belts along the main rivers and canals; to create soil and water conservation forest belts in the foothills and sloping areas; and to create sand prevention forest belts on the edges of some Gobi deserts. Currently, each reclamation area is carrying out spring afforestation and tree planting work. It is expected that the spring afforestation plan will be fully completed by the end of April.

    新疆垦区积极营造防护林带
    新疆垦区积极建设防护林带。各垦区都初步制定了造林和培育苗圃的具体计划，有些垦区还勘查了防护林带的路线，区划出了林带范围。乌鲁木齐垦区、玛纳斯垦区和哈密垦区计划今年造林一万一千亩，阿克苏垦区计划在一九五三年到一九五五年三年内，营造各种林带七千九百余亩，并拟育苗六百五十万株，现在已培育的树苗，计有沙枣、桃、杏三点五公顷，枝条、砧木等一百八十余万株。各垦区在建设防护林带的计划中，还根据不同情况，拟在已耕地区和可耕而未垦地区造护田林带；在主要河川和水渠两岸造护堤林带；在山麓斜坡地区造水土保持林带；在有些戈壁边缘造防沙林带。目前，各垦区正在进行春季造林植树工作。预计在四月底即可全部完成春季造林计划。
