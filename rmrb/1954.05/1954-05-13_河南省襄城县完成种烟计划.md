    Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, Completes Tobacco Planting Plan

    Xiangcheng County, Henan, a famous tobacco-producing area in China, has completed its tobacco planting task according to the national plan. This year, the tobacco fields throughout the county have generally received more fertilizer, and seedling transplantation has been adopted. According to the existing experience of tobacco farmers, transplanting seedlings can yield thirty to forty more jin per mu than direct seeding. For example, the Xu Bingchen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangmiao Township used the transplanting method this year, planting an average of 1,430 seedlings per mu, about 150 more seedlings per mu than last year, and the seedlings are growing evenly and vigorously. Currently, 80% of the tobacco fields in the township have adopted the seedling transplanting method, and the tobacco planting area has also expanded by 150 mu compared to last year.

    At present, tobacco farmers throughout the county are actively replanting seedlings, protecting seedlings, and preventing pests and diseases, striving for a bumper tobacco harvest. (Lü Jianzhong)

    河南省襄城县完成种烟计划
    我国著名产烟区河南襄城县，已按照国家计划完成了种烟任务。今年全县烟田普遍施肥较多，并采用了移苗法。根据烟农们已有的经验，移苗栽种比直播每亩能够多收三十斤至四十斤。例如，双庙乡徐丙辰农业生产合作社，今年用移苗法，每亩平均栽一千四百三十棵，比去年每亩约多一百五十棵，苗儿也长得匀整、旺盛。现全乡百分之八十的烟草田采用了移苗栽种法，种烟面积也比去年扩大了一百五十亩。
    目前，全县烟农们正在积极进行补苗、保苗、预防病虫害，争取烟草丰收。（吕建中）
