(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 19th) A "Pravda" reporter reported from Geneva that when the foreign ministers of various countries decided to hold secret meetings attended by only a few people, they agreed not to release any news about such meetings to the press. However, even before the ministers adjourned on May 17th, bourgeois news agencies were already using all telephone lines, telegraph lines, and radio stations to spread news and misinterpret the proceedings of the meeting.

The "Pravda" reporter wrote: By comparing information from various sources and eliminating false news, it is possible and necessary to restore the true picture of the meeting's progress. It is reported that at the May 17th meeting, the foreign ministers reached an agreement stipulating that the French delegation and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should hold negotiations to resolve issues related to the removal of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu. It must be pointed out that the US news agencies avoided mentioning the fact that this agreement was reached at the meeting. Subsequently, the foreign ministers discussed the procedures for studying the establishment of peace in Indochina. The meeting adopted the Soviet delegation's proposal to use the proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the French delegation as the basis for discussion.

The Soviet delegation's proposal advocated: discussing the suggestions in the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the French delegation item by item; because both of these proposals include clauses related to the military situation, the discussion of the Indochina issue should therefore begin with the study of these clauses; in addition, Eden's questions and the Soviet delegation's proposals should also be studied during the discussion process.

The article continued: It must be pointed out that Agence France-Presse distorted the truth when reporting on this meeting, insisting that the discussion of these two plans would "focus on" military issues.

Agence France-Presse also greatly distorted the question of the procedure for discussing the Indochina issue. It insisted that the chief representative of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, "raised the issue of separating the problems of Laos and Cambodia from the problem of Vietnam." In fact, it is well known that the French delegation, with the support of the US delegation, attempted to artificially separate the problems of Laos and Cambodia from the problem of Vietnam. The Soviet delegation believed that the problems of Laos and Cambodia should not be discussed separately from the problem of Vietnam. The Chinese delegation and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also believed that the problems of Laos and Cambodia should not be discussed separately from the problem of Vietnam. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that Agence France-Presse's fabricated report is clearly in contradiction with the facts. The attempt by certain people in Western countries to confuse public opinion by using the biased reports of bourgeois news agencies can only harm the successful work of the foreign ministers' conference. The "Pravda" reporter said: Perhaps that is precisely the intention of those who instructed the spread of such rumors.

   “真理报”记者
    揭露西方通讯社歪曲限制性会议情况
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：“真理报”记者自日内瓦报道，各国外长在决定举行只有少数人参加的秘密会议时，彼此协议不向报界发表这种会议的消息。但是，五月十七日部长们还没有散会，资产阶级通讯社就已利用所有的电话线、电报线和无线电台发出消息，乱解释会议的过程。
    “真理报”记者写道：把各种来源的消息加以比较，并剔除去那些假消息，那就可以把会议的进行情况还它一个本来面目，而且这样做也是必要的。据悉，各国外长在五月十七日的会议上已取得协议，规定法国代表团和越南民主共和国代表团双方进行谈判，以解决与运走奠边府伤员有关的问题。不能不指出，美国通讯社避而不谈会上达成这一协议的事实。其后，外长们讨论了研究确立印度支那和平问题的程序。会议通过了苏联代表团的建议：以越南民主共和国代表团和法国代表团所提出的建议作为讨论基础。
    苏联代表团的建议主张：就越南民主共和国代表团和法国代表团的建议中各项建议逐项进行讨论；因为这两个建议中都包括有关军事局势的条款，印度支那问题的讨论因此应该从研究这些条款开始；此外，在讨论过程中也研究艾登提出的问题以及苏联代表团的建议。
    文章接着说：不能不指出，法新社在报道这次会议时歪曲了事实的真相，它硬说讨论这两个计划时“将偏重于”军事问题。
    法新社对于讨论印度支那问题的程序问题也大加歪曲。它硬说：苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫“提出了把寮国与高棉的问题与越南问题分开的问题”。事实上，大家知道，是法国代表团在美国代表团的支持下，企图人为地将寮国和高棉的问题与越南问题分开。苏联代表团认为，不能将寮国和高棉的问题与越南问题分开讨论。中国代表团和越南民主共和国代表团也认为，不能将寮国和高棉的问题与越南问题分割讨论。因此，不难看出，法新社捏造的报道显然是和事实矛盾的。西方国家某些人士想借助于资产阶级通讯社的别有用心的报道来混淆社会的视听，这种企图只会有害于外长会议成功地进行工作。“真理报”记者说：也许那些指使散布这种谣言的人居心正是如此。
