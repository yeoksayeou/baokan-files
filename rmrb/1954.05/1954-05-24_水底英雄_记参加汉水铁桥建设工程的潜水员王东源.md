    Underwater Hero
    – An Account of Diver Wang Dongyuan's Participation in the Hanshui Iron Bridge Construction Project
  　Lian Yunshan
    One day in April this year, a train carrying passengers from Beijing to Shenyang sped across a brand new iron bridge over the Daling River in Northeast China. People know that for many years, whenever floods raged, the Daling River Bridge would be submerged, cutting off transportation between Guannei (Inner China) and the Northeast. However, this situation is now a thing of the past. During the construction of this iron bridge last winter, Wang Dongyuan, a diver from the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, worked in the cold Daling River, more than three zhang (approximately 10 meters) deep; wearing heavy diving gear, he used wind guns to flush away sand and drills to chisel rocks. Why? In order to firmly anchor the thick, several-hundred-ton reinforced concrete square caissons to the riverbed as foundations. Wasn't it cold? His hands often became numb and unresponsive in the water. Wasn't it tiring? He felt sore all over after emerging from the water each day. Was it just a few days of intense work? No, he continuously worked in the deep water for five hours a day, for twenty-eight consecutive days. Originally, according to underwater pressure and the body's ability to adapt, he should have come out of the water to rest for a day after working for four hours, but he always exceeded the safe time limit. The attendant (surface assistant) would constantly ask the underwater worker: "Can you take it? Come up and rest!" The answer was always: "I'm alright, let me work a little longer." Whenever he came out of the water, people always saw that he was exhausted. Because in his mind: "This is laboring for the prosperity and strength of the country, how can you not make a special effort?"
    The heroic labor of Wang Dongyuan and his comrades enabled the foundation engineering of the two largest bridge piers of the Daling River Iron Bridge to be completed two days ahead of schedule. Soon, the higher authorities granted Wang Dongyuan a twenty-day short vacation, allowing him to return to his hometown in Shandong to visit his elderly father. However, at this time, in the preliminary work for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge – the Hanshui Iron Bridge project – the two bridge piers with the deepest water and the largest projects had to be built out of the water before the flood season. Difficult underwater work required divers. Wang Dongyuan thought: "Building the bridge is a matter related to the country's path to prosperity. Now that people are needed, can I just leave it alone? But going home to visit is also a rare opportunity." He thought to himself for a while, then quickly walked to the team headquarters and reported to the instructor: "I'm not going home! Please send me to work!" Political instructor Zhang Yuncai looked at this strong, young soldier with some surprise: "Why, Comrade Wang Dongyuan? It has already been decided that you will have a vacation. Wouldn't it be good to go home and visit?" Wang Dongyuan replied: "No, bridge building is important. Besides, I can also practice my skills, so I can participate in the construction of the Yangtze River Iron Bridge in the future..." The instructor listened to this diver's simple and firm reply, pondered for a moment, and then happily said: "Alright! Then prepare immediately and go to the work area today." That day, Wang Dongyuan appeared on the diving boat in the Hanshui Iron Bridge work area. The boat was close to the largest key project of the iron bridge – the location of Pier No. 5. Here, the huge crane booms were constantly transporting equipment, and everyone from the bottom of the water to the sky was working intensely.
      At night, when thousands of electric lights illuminated the rolling river, a difficult situation arose; a huge crane boat was suspending a reinforced concrete pipe pile, more than ten people tall, more than one circumference thick, and weighing more than four tons, in the river. Originally, this bridge pile was to be placed on the riverbed and then driven into the riverbed with a several-ton steam hammer. (This bridge pier is made of dozens of piles of the same size arranged in a circle to form the bottom pile of the pier.) However, according to measurements, the pile tip had not yet reached the riverbed and could not be lowered. Was there an accident? Or was it blocked by something? The engineers and workers were anxious. The work of the huge machinery and many workers had to stop.
    Wang Dongyuan received instructions from the engineer: prepare to go into the water to understand the situation. His comrade Wang Tinghe told him: "Be careful, the water is flowing very fast." He replied: "Don't worry!" He put on his diving suit and immediately sank into the water... The rapid current relentlessly pushed him downstream. Diving in such rapid water was inherently difficult. However, the entire project was waiting for him. He tried his best to follow the thick bridge pile, releasing air and quickly letting go, sinking rapidly. When he had only sunk more than one zhang deep, the fierce current finally knocked his hand loose and quickly pushed him downstream... At this time, he felt a little "panicked" in his heart, because the air pipe and signal rope had lost their vertical state. If the air pipe was caught by something or he hit the tangled steel bars, it would be very likely to cause danger, and the progress of the project would be affected. At this time, he quickly called into the telephone transmitter:
  "Let it down! Let it down!" Then he released air fiercely. Immediately, his whole body sank downward, and soon the air pipe was vertical. However, this dive was a failure, because he had been washed away more than one zhang. In the dark water, he could no longer touch the bridge pile. "Pull it up! Quickly." After he rose out of the water, other comrades wanted to replace him, but how could he allow it? Wang Dongyuan carefully thought about the reason why he was washed away by the water just now, and then bravely re-entered the water. He changed his position, tightly clinging to the upstream of the thick bridge pile, sinking downwards. The rapid current hit him as if he were stuck to the pile, but it couldn't wash him away. He used all his strength to push once, release some air, and then sink rapidly... This time he succeeded, he touched the "root cause", rose out of the water, stood on the ladder of the diving boat (half of his body was still in the water), took off the large copper helmet, and excitedly reported to engineer Zou Yuzhang: "The tip of this pile is resting on the head of another pile!" The engineer made a decision; he said to the work area commander: "Move the position and re-drive it!" The workers started working, the machines started, the crane rotated, and the huge roar began again. Although the second spring flood – "Peach Blossom Water" – was flowing in the river, the water level was rising, and the flow rate was increasing, but what could be done? Wang Dongyuan's diving work was successful. He should also rest, because he had already fought in the deep water twice. People saw that he was already covered in sweat. His attendant Wang Tinghe was about to take off his diving suit to let him rest, but Wang Dongyuan said: "Don't rush, are there any other tasks?"
    At this time, a problem occurred on another large pile not far away. Only a heavy sound of the pile driver hammer "bang" was heard and then it stopped. It turned out that the pile was almost driven to the specified limit (close to the hard rock at the bottom of the river), and each hit only went in a little bit, but this time the hammer suddenly hit half a chi (approximately 17cm). "There's been an accident, there's been an accident! Did it break?" People on the surface could not know for sure, and divers were still needed to enter the water to understand. Wang Dongyuan was going down again, his comrade Wang Tinghe stopped him and said: "No, you are already very tired, let us go down." He calmly replied: "I'm still alright, I'll go down, wouldn't you be very tired if you went down?" After saying that, he sank into the water again. This time, perhaps his strength was insufficient, and the rapid current made him sway from side to side. However, he bravely reconnoitered underwater for an hour, rose out of the water, and accurately reported the broken condition of the large pile. Based on his report, the engineer quickly took corresponding measures, and the pile driver restarted. It was already midnight. On the river surface illuminated by the flashing electric lights, it could be seen that people were busy, trying to build this difficult key project – Pier No. 5 – out of the water before the arrival of the big flood. At this time, although Wang Dongyuan felt very tired physically, he was very happy, because he felt that, as in the past, he was treating the people's work with selfless labor.
    Soon, in the work of lifting the underwater steel sheet pile cofferdam of Pier No. 4, he repeatedly worked underwater with tenacious spirit, studied on the water, and proposed an important rationalization proposal together with other comrades, increasing the speed from dismantling and lifting one steel plate (more than one thousand jin per plate) per hour to nine plates. Pier No. 4 was successfully completed before the flood season.
    When Wang Dongyuan, as a representative of the diving team's meritorious personnel, went to Beijing to attend the third celebration conference of the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army, I visited him. This simple soldier from a peasant background excitedly stated that he would also work hard in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, the largest bridge in the East; especially after studying the Party's general task during the transition period, his heart became even brighter; when he thought of the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge being built, with trains running on the bridge and large ships passing under the bridge, he felt that he had made so many arduous efforts to enter a prosperous socialist society.

    水底英雄
    ——记参加汉水铁桥建设工程的潜水员王东源
  　连云山
    今年四月间的一天，火车载着由北京到沈阳方面去的旅客，从东北大凌河上一座崭新的大铁桥上，奔驰而过。人们都知道：多少年来，每当洪水暴涨，大凌河桥因被洪水淹没，关内和东北的交通便要因此而断绝。但是，现在这种情况已是一去不返了。这座铁桥在去年冬季施工时，中国人民解放军铁道兵潜水员王东源同志，曾经在三丈多深的寒冷的大凌河底；穿着笨重的潜水衣，使风枪冲沙子，用钻子凿岩石。为什么？为的是把那粗大的、几百吨重的钢骨混凝土方形沉箱，稳稳地扎在河底作为基础。那不冷吗？在水底他两手常常冻的麻木不灵。那不累吗？他每天出水以后，就浑身酸痛。那只是几天的突击吗？不是的，他每天持续五个小时的深水工作，连续了二十八天。本来，按照水底压力和人体适应的能力，工作四小时就得出水休息一天，但他每次总是超过了安全时限，侍候员（水上助手）不时向水底问：“受得了吗？你升上来休息吧！”回答总是：“还行，再干一会儿。”每当他出水时，人们总是看到他已经精疲力尽了。因为照他的想法是：“这是为国家繁荣富强而劳动，你能不特别努力吗？”
    王东源和他的战友们英雄般的劳动，使大凌河铁桥两个最大的桥墩基础工程，提前两天完工了。不久，上级给了王东源二十天的短期休假，允许他回山东老家去看看，他也很想回家去探望年迈的父亲。可是，就在这时，修建武汉长江大桥的前奏——汉水铁桥工程中，在江水最深处，工程最大的两个桥墩，必须在洪水期前修出水面，艰难的水下工作，正需要潜水员去做，王东源想：“修建大桥是关系祖国走向繁荣的事，现在正需要人，我能走开不管吗？可是回家看看也是难得的机会。”他独自想了一阵，就快步地走到队部去，报告指导员说：“我不回家去了！请上级派我去工作吧！”政治指导员张云彩端详着这位健壮的、年青的战士，有点惊奇：“为什么，王东源同志？已经决定你休假了，回家去看看不好吗？”王东源回答道：“不，修桥要紧，再说也可以练练技术，将来也好参加修长江大铁桥……。”指导员听了这位潜水员纯朴而坚定的回答，沉思了一会，就高兴地说：“好吧！那你立即准备，今天就到工区去。”当天，王东源出现在汉水铁桥工区的潜水专用船上，船身紧靠着铁桥最大的关键工程——五号桥墩的位置，在这里，巨大的吊船吊杆，不停地运送着器材，从水底到高空都在紧张地工作。
      夜晚，当千万盏电灯光照耀着滚滚江水的时候，一个困难的情况出现了；巨大的起重吊船，吊着一个十多人高，一围多粗，四吨多重的钢骨水泥管桩，悬在江中。本来要把这个桥桩下在河底，再用几吨重的汽锤把它打进江底。（这个桥墩是用同样大的数十根桩布成圆形，作桥墩的底桩）但是，现在根据测量，桩尖还没有放到河底，就放不下去了。是出了什么意外吗？还是被什么东西顶住了呢？工程师和工人们焦急着。巨大的机械和许多工人的工作不得不停下来了。
    王东源得到工程师的指示：准备下水去了解情况，他的战友王庭和嘱咐他：“小心点，这水流得很急。”他回答道：“请放心！”他穿好潜水衣，即刻向水底下沉……。急湍的水流，无情地，紧紧地向下游推着他，在这样急水中潜水本是件困难的事。但是，整个工程等着他。他用力地顺着那粗大的桥桩，一面放气，一面急速地松手一沉，当他才下沉了一丈多深的时候，凶猛的急流终于把他打脱了手，急速地推拥着他奔向下游去……。这时，他心里确实有点“慌”了，因为气管和信号绳已经失去了垂直状态。假如气管被什么东西夹住或者自己碰到乱钢筋上，那就很可能出危险，工程进度也就要受到影响。这时，他赶紧对着电话送话器呼叫：
  “往下放！往下放！”随即就猛猛的放气。立刻，全身就向下沉去，很快地气管垂直了。但是，这次潜水是失败了，因为他已经被冲跑了一丈远，在黑暗的水底，他再也摸不到那个桥桩了。“往上拉吧！快点。”他升出水面后，别的同志要换他，他怎能允许，王东源仔细地想了一下刚才被水冲跑的道理，随即勇敢地重新入水，他改变了位置，紧靠着粗大的桥桩上游往下沉，急流冲击着他好像贴在桩上一样，但无法冲跑他，他用尽力气推一下，放一下气，随之急速下沉……。这一次成功了，他摸到那“症结”所在，升出水面，站在潜水船的梯子上，（半截身还在水里）卸下大铜帽，兴奋地向邹玉章工程师报告说：“这根桩尖顶在另一根桩头上了！”工程师下了决心；对工区指挥说：“移动位置，重新打入！”工人们开工了，机器发动了，吊船旋转了，巨大的轰鸣又开始了。虽然江里流着第二次春汛——“桃花水”，水位在上涨，流速在增加，但是有什么办法呢？王东源潜水工作胜利了。他也该休息了，因为他已经在深水里搏斗了两次。人们看到他已经是浑身大汗，他的侍候员王庭和就要给他脱去潜水衣让他休息，王东源说：“别忙，还有别的任务吗？”
    正在这时，不远处另一根大桩上出了问题。只听到沉重的打桩机汽锤“咣噹”地响了一声就停下来了。原来那根桩已经快打到规定限度（接近了河底硬石），每打一下只进一小点，但这一汽锤猛然打下半尺。“出事故了，出事故了！是不是打断了呢？”水面上的人们是无法知道究竟的，现在仍然需要潜水员入水了解。王东源又要下去，他的战友王庭和拦住他说：“不，你已经很累了，我们下去。”他平静地回答说：“我还行，我来下，你下去不也是很累吗？”说完，他又沉入水底去了。这一次也许是他力气已经不足，急流打的他左右摇晃，然而，他奋勇在水底侦察了一个小时，升出水面，准确地报告了那大桩的拆断情形，工程师根据他的报告，迅速地作了相应措施，打桩机重新开动了，这时已是午夜，在电灯光闪闪照耀的江面上，可以看到：人们忙碌着，要在大洪水到来以前，把这个艰巨的关键工程——五号桥墩修出水面。此时，王东源虽感到身体非常疲乏，但是心情却很愉快，因为他觉得自己一如过去一样，是以奋不顾身的劳动，对待人民的工作的。
    不久，在四号桥墩吊出水下钢板围堰的工作中，他以顽强的精神反复地水底工作，水上研究，和别的战友一道提出了一项重要的合理化建议，从每小时拆吊一块钢板（每块一千多斤）的速度，提高到九块。四号桥墩在洪水期前胜利地完工了。
    当王东源以潜水队功臣代表的资格，到北京出席解放军铁道兵第三届庆功大会时，我去访问了他，这位纯朴的农民出身的战士兴奋地表示：他还要在东方第一大桥长江大桥的修建中奋勇劳动；特别是学习了党在过渡时期的总任务后，他的心里更明亮了；当他想到雄伟的长江大桥修成后，桥上跑火车，桥底过大轮船的情景时，他觉得自己是作过多少艰苦的努力才走进繁荣的社会主义社会去的。（附图片）
