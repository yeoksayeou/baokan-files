"Big Stick" Policy and Bluffing
Wu Quan

The Geneva Conference has begun discussions on the Indochina issue. However, it is clear that the US ruling clique, which is trying every possible means to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina, is using the "big stick" policy, blocking the Geneva Conference, to hinder negotiations on the Indochina issue. The United States is instigating and supporting the French delegation to put forward bluffing proposals that they know are impossible to be accepted, creating obstacles to the progress of the conference.

The US propaganda machine has long been doing this, calling a stag a horse, and biting back, saying that "the possibility of reaching an agreement in Geneva now seems to depend largely on whether the Communist proposals are excessive" (Washington Post and Times Herald editorial); and asserted that "the West may find their demands difficult to meet" (Associated Press, Geneva, 9th).

This propaganda technique even reached the point where, when representatives from France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had already put forward proposals, and the different attitudes and desires reflected in these two proposals were so obvious, the American propagandists still insisted that "the Communists are still far from wanting to negotiate seriously," and therefore they were eager to make "pessimistic judgments" about the Geneva Conference.

However, the facts are all there, and American propagandists cannot distort them or hide them.

US officials are trying their best to distort the reasonable proposals for restoring peace in Indochina put forward by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong. A spokesman for the US delegation, after Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong put forward eight proposals, actually said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's plan was for France to "unconditionally surrender" to the Communists. Anyone with a clear head can see that this statement has no basis in fact. Because Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong suggested that the warring parties in Indochina should first implement a complete ceasefire simultaneously throughout the territory of Indochina, which is not only practical and reasonable, but also fully in line with the universal aspirations of peace-loving people of all countries, especially the people of Indochina and the French people. Where is the issue of "surrender"?

On the contrary, it is French Foreign Minister Bidault's "tough" proposals, put forward in order to "ensure US support," that are completely arbitrary conditions that disregard reality. Bidault demanded the withdrawal and disarmament of the Vietnam People's Army, and included conditions aimed at disbanding the Lao and Cambodian People's Armies. Everyone believes that this is actually the ceasefire condition put forward by French Prime Minister Laniel in the French National Assembly on March 5, which was precisely the condition denounced by French public opinion and many parliamentarians as ordering the Indochinese people to "surrender." Facts prove that Laniel and Bidault have not changed their arrogant attitude to this day.

Bidault's attitude cannot solve the problem. France is not the victor in Indochina; the French "Combat" newspaper also believes that now "is not the time for people to speak in the posture of victors on behalf of a country that they have led to defeat." The British "Daily Telegraph" pointed out in its editorial on the 10th: "Bidault's proposal is unrealistic," "this proposal will be unacceptable to the Communists because it forces them into a position of weakness that they cannot admit." Obviously, Bidault's bluffing is completely out of place. Now, the era of colonialists in Asia is over, and no force can stop the realization of the Indochinese people's desire for national independence.

The United States and its partners are blindly opposed to Pham Van Dong's reasonable proposals, but cannot put forward any justifiable reasons, and can only parrot the US's die-hard attitude on the Korean issue. They oppose an immediate ceasefire, oppose the withdrawal of foreign troops, oppose the cessation of US military aid, and oppose free elections without foreign interference. This die-hard attitude is even more obvious on the Indochina issue. United Press International Geneva, 10th, reported: "The West has shown in the Korean issue that it does not accept any plan for holding Communist-style free elections." What is this for? Obviously, because they are afraid that if truly free elections are held that appeal to popular will, then they will not be able to impose the ruling system established by the colonialists on the people. This UPI dispatch shows this fact, they are afraid that without French bayonets, the anti-people regime will not be able to stand firm; without US military aid, the French colonialists will not be able to stand firm either. That is to say, the reason why they are so afraid of free elections is because France does not want to end its colonial rule in Indochina, and the United States cannot take France's place and replace it.

US diplomats are using their French partners, bluffing, waving their "big stick," trying to resist the Indochina peace plan, and continuing to stubbornly implement their plan to expand the Indochina war. Dulles, in a speech on the 7th, openly said that the United States believes that "the question of what action we will take with respect to the current hostilities in Vietnam remains," therefore, "the need to create conditions for taking joint action to defend the region will be even more urgent."

However, what is the way out that the United States has prepared for France? The British have already seen this. According to Reuters Paris 8th: "France may have to accept the realistic conclusion that its own resources in Indochina are almost exhausted, and there will undoubtedly be a strong demand to hand Indochina over to the Americans, as Greece did a few years ago." Laval and his ilk's openly clamoring for the "internationalization" of the Indochina war is, in fact, intending to take this path. However, it is clear that this is only to enable the United States to replace France's position in Indochina, and continue to let French youth bleed in Indochina to die for the United States.

    “大棒”政策和虚张声势
    吴全
    日内瓦会议开始了印度支那问题的讨论。但人们已清楚地看到：千方百计地阻挠恢复印度支那和平的美国统治集团，正在使用“大棒”政策，梗在日内瓦会议上，来阻挠对印度支那问题的谈判。美国怂恿和支持法国代表团，提出明知决不可能被接受的虚张声势的建议，给会议的进展造成障碍。
    美国宣传机器很早就为了这个目的，指鹿为马，反口咬人，说什么“在日内瓦取得协议的可能性现在似乎在很大程度上要决定于共产党的建议是否过分”（华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报社论）；并且断言“西方可能会觉得他们的要求是很难满足的”（美联社日内瓦九日电）。
    这种宣传手法，甚至达到了这样的地步：当法国和越南民主共和国的代表都已提出了建议，这两个建议所反映的不同态度和愿望已如此明显的时候，美国的宣传家们依然硬说“共产党仍远不想认真谈判”，因而他们就急于对日内瓦会议下“悲观的判断”了。
    但是，事实俱在，美国宣传家歪曲不了，也掩盖不住。
    美国官方竭力歪曲范文同代外长所提出的恢复印度支那和平的合理建议。一个美国代表团的发言人，在范文同代外长提出了八项建议之后，竟然说什么越南民主共和国代表团的方案是要法国向共产党“无条件投降”。任何头脑清楚的人都可以看出，这种说法是毫无事实根据的。因为，范文同代外长建议印度支那交战双方首先在整个印度支那领土上同时实行彻底停火，这不但是切实可行的和合理的，而且也是完全符合于各国爱好和平人民，特别是印度支那人民和法国人民的普遍愿望。那里有什么“投降”的问题呢？
    相反的，正是法国外长皮杜尔为了“确保美国的支持”而提出的“强硬”建议，才是完全不顾现实的专横条件。皮杜尔要求越南人民军撤退和解除武装，并包括了目的在于解散寮国和高棉人民军队的条件。大家都认为，这实际上是法国总理拉尼埃三月五日在法国国民议会中提出的停战条件，而这个条件恰恰是被法国舆论和许多议员指斥为命令印度支那人民“投降”的条件。事实证明，拉尼埃和皮杜尔直至现在还没有改变他们的这种狂妄的态度。
    皮杜尔的这种态度是不能解决问题的。法国在印度支那不是战胜者；法国的“战斗报”也认为现在“不是当人们代表由他们导向失败的国家而以胜利者的姿态说话的时候了”。英国“每日电讯报”在十日的社论中指出：“皮杜尔的建议是不现实的”，“这个建议对共产党人来说将是不可接受的，因为它迫使他们处于他们所不能承认的软弱地位”。显然，皮杜尔的虚张声势，是完全不合时宜的。现在，在亚洲殖民者的时代已经过去了，没有任何力量能够阻挡印度支那人民要求民族独立的愿望的实现的。
    美国和它的伙伴们一味反对范文同的合理建议，却提不出任何站得住脚的理由，而只能依样画葫芦地搬出美国在朝鲜问题上的死硬态度来。它们反对立即停火，反对撤退外国军队，反对停止美国的军事援助，反对不受外力干涉地举行自由选举。这种死硬态度在印度支那问题上表现得更加明显了。合众社日内瓦十日电称：“西方已经在朝鲜问题中表明，它不接受任何关于举行共产党式的自由选举的方案”。这究竟是为了什么呢？很明显的，因为它们害怕如果真正举行诉诸民意的自由选举，那末，它们就不能把殖民者所建立的统治制度强加在人民的头上。合众社的这个电讯，就表明了这个事实，它们害怕：如果没有法国的刺刀，反人民的政权将要站不牢；如果没有美国的军事援助，法国殖民者也会站不住。这就是说，它们所以那样害怕自由选举，是因为法国不想结束它在印度支那的殖民统治，美国也就不能取法国的地位而代之。
    美国外交家正在利用它的法国伙伴，虚张声势，挥动着他们的“大棒”，企图抵制印度支那和平的方案，而继续固执实行它们扩大印度支那战争的方案。杜勒斯在七日发表的演说中，公开说美国认为“关于我们对目前越南的敌对行为将采取什么行动的问题仍然存在”，因此，“创立采取联合行动以保卫这个地区的条件的需要甚至将更为迫切”。
    然而，美国替法国准备的出路是什么呢？英国人已经看到这一点了。据路透社巴黎八日电：“法国可能不得不接受这样现实的结论：它自己在印度支那的资源已经差不多用完了，而且无疑会出现一种强烈的要求，要求把印度支那交给美国人，像几年以前希腊所做的那样。”纳瓦尔之流公开叫嚷的印度支那战争“国际化”，事实上就是打算走这样一条路。但是，很清楚，这只是使美国取代法国在印度支那的地位，并且继续让法国青年在印度支那流血，去替美国效死罢了。
