    People's Bank of China Actively Supports Farmers' Spring Plowing
    Issuing Over 3 Trillion Yuan in Agricultural Loans

    [From this newspaper] In order to help farmers in various regions carry out spring plowing production, the People's Bank of China in various regions has actively issued large amounts of agricultural loans. According to incomplete statistics, from November of last year to April 20 of this year, over 3 trillion yuan of agricultural loans have been issued nationwide; from April 1 to April 20 alone, approximately 1 trillion yuan was issued. Currently, the regions where the production season started earlier have already completed the issuance, and most regions are continuing to issue loans.

    Many regions investigated the production difficulties of local farmers before issuing loans, so that the loans could be issued in a way that better meets the needs of the farmers. This year, many improvements have been made to the loan issuance procedures in various regions, overcoming the past shortcomings of excessive emphasis on earmarked funds and complicated procedures. Generally, cash is issued in various regions, allowing farmers to purchase the necessary means of production themselves, while simplifying the issuance procedures as much as possible. After issuing loans, the People's Bank of Hunan Province also conducted timely inspections and appropriately supplemented loans to individual farmers who should have received them but did not. During the period of agricultural loan issuance, local supply and marketing cooperatives generally strengthened the supply of materials. In some regions, the People's Bank of China and the supply and marketing cooperatives jointly went to the countryside to issue loans and supply farmers with means of production. For example, after the Tangcun branch of the People's Bank of China in Fei County, Shandong Province, and the local supply and marketing cooperative conducted an in-depth investigation of the actual needs of farmers, they jointly brought funds and goods to the countryside. Within two or three days, they issued more than 39 million yuan in loans and supplied a large amount of means of production, saving farmers a lot of time.

    The People's Bank of China in various regions has timely issued large amounts of agricultural loans, helping farmers solve some of the difficulties in production and strongly supporting spring plowing production. Songjiang Province issued approximately 18.7 billion yuan in loans by the end of March, helping farmers purchase 1,500 new-style farm tools, 8 million jin of various seeds, and 1,600 head of draft animals. According to preliminary statistics from the People's Bank of China branches in 45 counties in Shanxi Province, the loans issued helped farmers purchase and repair 203 carts, purchase 1,654 head of draft animals, as well as a large number of waterwheels, walking plows, small farm tools, cake fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, and other means of production. In the issuance of loans, all regions paid attention to taking care of the needs of all parties, both helping mutual aid and cooperative organizations solve the difficulties in improving cultivation and equipment that required more funds, and also paying attention to meeting the needs of individual farmers, while giving appropriate consideration to economic crop areas and disaster areas. For example, according to statistics from Henan Province in March, the production and disaster relief loans issued in Xinxiang, Xuchang, Nanyang, and other five special districts amounted to more than 14 billion yuan. Liaoxi Province issued 3.05 billion yuan in livestock feed loans in disaster areas, effectively solving the production difficulties of disaster victims in these areas.

    人民银行积极支持农民春耕
    发出农业贷款三万多亿元
    【本报讯】为了帮助各地农民进行春耕生产，各地人民银行积极发放大批农业贷款。据不完全的统计，从去年十一月到今年四月二十日止，全国已发放了三万余亿元的农业贷款；四月一日到二十日，就发放了约一万亿元。现在，生产季节开始较早的地区，已经发放完毕，大部地区正在继续发放中。
    许多地区在发放贷款以前，调查了当地农民生产困难的情况，使贷款发放得更能符合农民的需要。各地发放贷款的手续今年有不少改进，克服了过去过分强调专款专用和手续复杂等缺点。各地一般都发放现款，由农民自己选购需要的生产资料，同时尽量简化了发放手续。湖南省各县人民银行在发放贷款以后，还及时进行了检查，对个别应贷未贷的农户适当地予以补贷。各地在发放农业贷款期间，当地的供销合作社一般都加强了物资供应工作，有些地区的人民银行还和供销合作社共同下乡发放贷款和供应农民生产资料。如人民银行山东省费县唐村营业所和当地供销合作社深入调查了农民的实际需要以后，共同带款和带货下乡，在两三天时间内，发放了三千九百余万元贷款，供应了大批生产资料，节省了农民许多时间。
    各地人民银行及时发放大批农业贷款，帮助农民解决了生产上的一些困难，有力地支持了春耕生产。松江省到三月底发放了约一百八十七亿元的贷款，帮助农民购买了新式农具一千五百件、各种种籽八百万斤、耕畜一千六百头。山西省据四十五个县的人民银行支行的初步统计，发放的贷款帮助农民购买与修理大车二百零三辆，购买耕畜一千六百五十四头，以及大批水车、步犁、小农具、饼肥、种籽、农药等生产资料。在发放贷款中，各地都注意照顾了各方面的需要，既帮助互助合作组织解决了在改进耕作、改良设备方面需要较多资金的困难，也注意满足了单干农民的需要，同时对经济作物区和灾区予以适当的照顾。如河南省据三月份统计，新乡、许昌、南阳等五个专区发放的生产救灾贷款为一百四十余亿元，辽西省在灾区发放了牲畜饲料贷款三十亿五千万元，都有效地解决了这些地区的灾民在生产上的困难。
