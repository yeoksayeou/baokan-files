The "Exhibition of Unearthed Cultural Relics from National Basic Construction Projects," sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, will open at the Beijing History Museum on May 21.

The exhibition will display more than 3,700 representative cultural relics from North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Central South China, East China, and Southwest China. According to research by Chinese scientists, important cultural relics include: the "Ziyang Man" skull fossil unearthed in Sichuan, which is the skull of a teenage girl, dating back more than 100,000 years. It is dissimilar to both the European "Cro-Magnon man" or the "Upper Cave Man" of Zhoukoudian in China, providing valuable data and clues for the study of the physical evolution of ancient humans in China. The ancient biological fossils unearthed in the Huai River harnessing project in East China may be from the same era as "Peking Man." Many black pottery sites were discovered in the Huai River basin from Baisha to Huating, which expands the distribution area of the black pottery culture system that we previously knew. The inscribed bones for practicing calligraphy and other artifacts in Zhengzhou are another major discovery of Yin Dynasty cultural ruins outside of Anyang. More than 70 "iron molds" for casting agricultural tools from the Warring States period excavated near the ancient copper smelting site in Rehe Province allow us to understand for the first time the development of Warring States culture in the Northeast region. Other unearthed cultural relics include: mammalian fossils from Shanxi Province, relics of the Wokenhada cave culture in Songjiang Province, Warring States bamboo slips, lacquerware, and wood carvings from Changsha, stone statues from the Northern Wei to Tang dynasties in Quyang, Hebei, Han Dynasty portrait stones and bricks from Yinan, Shandong, and Chengdu, Sichuan, Han Dynasty pottery figurines and pottery paddy field burial goods from the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Han Dynasty house burial goods and wooden boat models from Guangzhou, porcelain from the Six Dynasties to the Tang and Song dynasties from Fujian, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanjing, etc., a complete set of Northern Wei pottery burial goods from the Northwest, Northern Zhou pottery figurines and Tang Dynasty tomb murals, Song Dynasty murals from Baisha tomb, and many Han Dynasty iron shovels, plows, hoes, axes and other production tools and pottery containing Han Dynasty millet, foxtail millet, sorghum, and rice unearthed in Luoyang. All are important materials for the study of China's material culture history.

The cultural relics exhibited in the exhibition were selected from more than 140,000 unearthed cultural relics from basic construction projects in China in recent years, and they have all been scientifically sorted and preserved. The cultural relics exhibited this time show that ancient ruins, ancient tombs, and a large number of ancient cultural relics may be buried in various basic construction areas in China, because these areas were often places where our ancestors labored and lived. For example, more than 1,000 Han Dynasty tombs were discovered in Anshan, Northeast China; in the Huai River and Yi River diversion projects in East China, ancient biological fossils dating back 300,000 to 1 million years were unearthed; in the Huai River harnessing area of Central South China, ancient cultural sites from the Neolithic Age and the Yin Dynasty, flexed burials from the Warring States period, hollow brick tombs from the Han Dynasty, and imitation wood structure tombs from the Song Dynasty were excavated. The "Ziyang Man" skull fossil from the Late Pleistocene of the Quaternary Period was discovered during the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project; the bronze container engraved with an inscription from the Eastern Han Dynasty was discovered during the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway project. Famous cities of the past were also concentrated areas of ancient tombs. For example, more than 1,000 tombs from the Warring States period to the Song Dynasty were cleared in Changsha, and more than 10,000 ancient tombs were discovered in Xi'an.

During the pre-exhibition period, heads of central departments, leading cadres of trade unions and industrial departments, as well as historians, writers, and artists, visited the exhibition. They unanimously believed that the ancient cultural relics exhibited this time are not only the most reliable physical evidence for studying China's history and culture, but also the most specific materials for conducting patriotism education among the broad masses of people. Everyone also recognized that industrial construction departments and cultural departments should cooperate closely to protect cultural relics while carrying out basic construction.

    全国基本建设工地出土文物将在京展览
    为研究我国历史和文化提供了重要资料
   【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部主办的“全国基本建设工程中出土文物展览会”，将于五月二十一日在北京历史博物馆开幕。
    展览会将展出华北、东北、西北、中南、华东、西南各地区有代表性的文物共三千七百多件。据我国科学家研究，其中重要的文物有：四川出土的
  “资阳人”头骨化石，是一个十几岁女孩的头骨，距今约有十万年以上，它和欧洲的“克鲁马努人”或我国周口店的“山顶洞人”都没有相似的地方，对我国古代人类体质进化的研究提供了珍贵的资料和线索。华东治淮工程中出土的古生物化石，可能是和“北京人”同时代的。从白沙到花厅的淮河流域中，发现了好多黑陶遗址，这就扩大了我们过去所认识的黑陶文化系统的分布地区。郑州的习字刻骨和其他器物，是安阳以外又一个殷代文化遗址的重大发现。在热河省古代冶铜场址附近发掘出来的七十多件战国时期铸造农业工具的“铁范”，使我们第一次认识了战国文化在东北地区的发展情况。其他出土文物如：山西省的哺乳类动物化石，松江省的倭肯哈达洞穴文化的遗物，长沙的战国竹简、漆器、木雕刻，河北曲阳的北魏至唐的石造像，山东沂南和四川成都等地的汉画像石、砖，宝
  （鸡）成（都）路的汉代陶俑和陶质水田明器，广州的汉代房屋明器与木船模型，福建、广州、长沙、南京等地的六朝至唐、宋的磁器，西北的全套北魏陶质明器，北周陶俑和唐代墓室彩绘壁画，白沙宋墓壁画，洛阳出土的许多汉代铁铲、犁、锄、斧等生产工具及陶器中保存的汉代的黍、谷子、高粱、稻子，都是我国物质文化史研究的重要资料。
    展览会中展览的文物，是从我国近几年来基本建设工程中十四万余件出土文物里选出来的，它们都经过比较科学的整理和保存。这次展出的文物，说明了在我国各个基本建设的地区，都可能埋藏有古遗址、古墓葬以及大量古代文物，因为这些地区往往是我们的祖先劳动生息过的地方。如在东北鞍山，发现的汉代等墓葬就有一千多座；在华东的治淮和导沂工程中，掘出了距今三十万年到一百万年的古生物化石；中南的治淮区，则又发掘出了新石器时代和殷代的古文化遗址、战国屈肢葬、汉代空心砖墓、宋代仿木结构墓等。第四纪更新统晚期的“资阳人”头骨化石则是在成渝铁路工程中发现的；刻有东汉铭文的铜斛是在兰新铁路工程中发现的。历代有名的都市又都是古墓葬的集中地区，如在长沙就清理出了战国到宋代的墓葬一千多座，在西安发现的古墓即达一万多座。
    在展览会预展期间，中央各部门的负责人，工会和工业部门的领导干部以及历史、文学、艺术工作者，都前往参观。他们一致认为，这次展出的古代文物，不但是研究我国历史和文化的最可靠的实物例证，也是对广大人民进行爱国主义教育的最具体的材料。大家并认识到，在进行基本建设的同时，工业建设部门和文化部门应该密切合作，保护文物。
