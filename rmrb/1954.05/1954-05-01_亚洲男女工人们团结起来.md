    Asian Men and Women Workers Unite
　　Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    The "May Day" International Labor Day of 1954 has arrived. On this day of solidarity and friendship, the working class and working people of Asia and the world will once again review their strength in striving to improve their lives, defend trade union and democratic rights, fight for national independence, and defend world peace.
    The working class and working people all over the world, in welcoming this year's "May Day", clearly see that their own strength is growing, their awareness is increasing, and their unity is strengthening.
    In countries where the people have stood up—in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries—the working people are commemorating their festival with unparalleled joy and with tremendous achievements in production. As peaceful economic construction develops day by day, the people's living standards are also improving day by day. The people of these countries love peace and are constantly striving to safeguard world peace. They deeply understand that only in a peaceful environment can they build their motherland better and make their lives happier. Their policy of maintaining world peace and promoting social progress is in line with the interests of the people of the world, and therefore has won the sympathy, trust and support of the working people of the world. The path of peace and happiness that they are taking is even more attractive to millions upon millions of working people around the world.
    However, in some other countries in the world, the working class and working people still have to struggle for a life of food and clothing and for their basic rights. In many Asian countries, the plight of the working people is getting worse, their lives are not guaranteed, and they are suffering from the pain and threat of unemployment. But these hardships cannot subdue their will. They are still full of fighting spirit and full of confidence in victory as they welcome "May Day" International Labor Day. They have realized that a thorough improvement in their lives is only possible under the guarantee of world peace and national independence. Therefore, they are unanimously engaged in unyielding struggles for peace and independence.
    It is precisely because of the efforts of the people of the world to strive for peace, especially the major efforts of the people of China and Korea and the people of the Soviet Union, that the Korean armistice was achieved, thereby initially easing international tensions. The realization of the Korean armistice vividly proves that a nation that rises up to fight for its own honor, freedom and independence is invincible, that the will of the awakened people is indestructible, and that a country that has stood up cannot be overthrown. At the same time, it also specifically proves that the "policy of strength" and the war policy of enslaving other nations are unworkable in international affairs and can only suffer a shameful defeat; on the contrary, only by adopting a peaceful approach in the spirit of consultation can existing international disputes be resolved.
    The advocates of the "policy of strength" turn a blind eye to this truth of peace and consultation, which is well known to the people of the world. Not only are they unwilling to accept their failure, but they are also continuing to step up their conspiracies, create tensions, and undermine peace in Asia and the world. The U.S. ruling clique not only attempts to obstruct the final settlement of the Korean issue, but is also stepping up the expansion of the Indochina war, coercing France, Britain and other countries to pull chestnuts out of the fire for U.S. monopoly capitalists. However, this not only does not shake the determination of the people of Indochina to fight for freedom and national independence, but also arouses opposition from the people of all countries. The working people of Asian countries have held rallies and demonstrations, unanimously condemning the U.S. plot to expand the Indochina war, demanding an end to the war and the restoration of peace in Indochina. The French people also unanimously demanded an end to this "dirty war" and opposed sending French children to sell their lives for the profits of Wall Street bosses.
    The advocates of the "policy of strength" have fallen into such an isolated position because they ignore and violate the will of the people. Now, the awareness of the people of Asia and the world has been greatly improved. They have learned from their own experience that the "policy of strength," "cold war," and "blockade and embargo" policies pursued by the U.S. ruling clique can only create tensions, threaten the security and national independence of various countries, affect the economies of various countries, and make the lives of the people of various countries worse. The working people of Asian countries unanimously demand to develop their national economies, improve their lives, and eliminate the threat and pain of unemployment. They hope that their trade union and democratic rights will be guaranteed so that they can live a free and happy life. And to achieve this goal, lasting peace and national independence are indispensable.
    The people of all Asian countries believe that the Geneva Conference with the participation of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, France, and other relevant countries will help to finally resolve the Korean issue, restore peace in Indochina, and further ease international tensions. Therefore, they have placed earnest hopes on this conference. For example, the "Asia Day" held on April 25 under the call of the All-India Peace Council showed the Indian people's desire for the Geneva Conference to achieve good results.
    Under the common goal of striving for peace, independence, freedom and happiness, the friendly unity of the working class of the world and of Asian countries is developing day by day, and the exchanges between the working brothers of various countries are becoming closer day by day. After liberation, the Chinese working class has strengthened its ties with the working classes of various countries. Representatives of the Chinese working class have visited many countries in Europe and Asia. Representatives of trade union organizations from all over the world and from Asian countries have also visited our country many times, and have personally witnessed the vigorous development of our country's peaceful construction and the steady improvement of our people's living standards and cultural level. This year's "May Day" International Labor Day, representatives of trade union organizations from many countries have come to Beijing at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to celebrate this great festival together with the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, which will further strengthen the friendly unity between the Chinese working class and the working classes of the world.
    The domestic and international unity of the working class is the banner of victory. Workers and brothers of all countries unite to enable the working class to win in the cause of improving lives, defending trade union and democratic rights, striving for and safeguarding national independence, and defending world peace.

    亚洲男女工人们团结起来
　　中华全国总工会副主席　刘宁一
    一九五四年的“五一”国际劳动节已经到来了。亚洲和全世界的工人阶级和劳动人民在这个团结友爱的日子里，将要又一次检阅自己争取改善生活、保卫工会与民主权利、争取民族独立、保卫世界和平的力量。
    全世界的工人阶级和劳动人民在迎接今年的“五一”节的时候，都清楚地看到了：他们自己的力量日益壮大、觉悟日益提高、团结日益加强。
    在人民站起来了的国家——在苏联、中国和人民民主国家，劳动人民都怀着无比欢欣的心情，以生产上的巨大成就来纪念自己的节日。由于和平经济建设一天天发展，人民的生活水平也一天天提高。这些国家的人民都热爱和平，始终为维护世界和平而努力。他们深刻地懂得，只有在和平的环境里，才能把自己的祖国建设得更美好，使自己的生活更幸福。他们所奉行的这种维护世界和平与促进社会进步的政策，是符合全世界人民的利益的，所以赢得了全世界劳动人民的同情、信任和支持，而他们所走的这条和平幸福的道路，更吸引了全世界的千百万的劳动人民。
    然而在世界上其他一些国家里，工人阶级和劳动人民至今还不得不为着温饱的生活和自己的基本权利而斗争。在亚洲许多国家里，劳动人民的处境每况愈下，他们的生活没有保证，而且还受着失业的痛苦和威胁。但是这些艰难困苦并不能屈服他们的意志。他们在迎接“五一”国际劳动节的时候还是充满着战斗的精神，满怀着胜利的信心。他们已经认识到，要使自己的生活得到彻底改善，只有在世界和平与民族独立得到保障的条件下才有可能。因此，他们都一致为和平与独立而进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    正是由于全世界人民争取和平的努力，特别是朝中两国人民和苏联人民的重大努力，朝鲜停战才得以实现，从而使国际紧张局势得到初步的缓和。朝鲜停战的实现生动地证明了：一个奋起战斗保卫自己的光荣、自由和独立的民族是不可战胜的，觉醒了的人民的意志是不可摧毁的，已经站起来了的国家是压不倒的。同时它也具体地证明了：在国际事务上采取“实力政策”和奴役其他民族的战争政策是行不通的，而且只能遭受到可耻的失败；相反的只有本着协商的精神，采取和平的方式，才可能解决现存的国际争端。
    “实力政策”的鼓吹者们对于全世界人民都了如指掌的这个和平与协商的真理是视若无睹的。他们不但不甘心于自己的失败，而且还在继续加紧进行阴谋活动，制造紧张局势，破坏亚洲与世界和平。美国统治集团不但企图阻挠朝鲜问题的最后解决，而且正在加紧扩大印度支那战争，胁迫法国、英国以及其他国家为美国垄断资本家火中取栗。但是，这不但丝毫也动摇不了印度支那人民争取自由和民族独立的决心，而且还激起了各国人民的反对。亚洲各国劳动人民举行了集会和示威，一致谴责美国企图扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，要求结束这场战争，恢复印度支那的和平。法国人民也一致要求结束这个“肮脏的战争”，反对派法国子弟为华尔街老板们的利润卖命。
    “实力政策”的鼓吹者陷入这样孤立的地位，是由于他们无视和违反人民的意志。现在，亚洲和全世界人民的觉悟已经大大提高，他们已从切身经验中懂得，美国统治集团所奉行的“实力政策”、“冷战”和“封锁禁运”政策等等，只能造成紧张局势，使各国的安全与民族独立受到威胁，使各国的经济受到影响，并使各国人民的生活日趋恶化。亚洲各国劳动人民一致要求发展民族经济，改善他们的生活，解除失业的威胁和痛苦。他们希望他们的工会与民主权利得到保障，能过自由幸福的生活。而要达到这个目的，没有持久的和平与民族的独立是不可能的。
    亚洲各国人民都认为，有苏、中、美、英、法及有关国家参加的日内瓦会议将有助于最后解决朝鲜问题，恢复印度支那的和平，进一步缓和国际紧张局势，因而他们对这个会议寄予了殷切的希望。例如在全印和平理事会号召下于四月二十五日举行的“亚洲日”，就表现了印度人民要求日内瓦会议取得良好结果的愿望。
    在争取和平、独立、自由与幸福的共同目标下，全世界以及亚洲各国工人阶级的友好团结一天天发展，各国工人兄弟们相互间的交往也一天天密切。中国工人阶级在解放后加强了与各国工人阶级的联系。中国工人阶级的代表曾经访问过欧洲和亚洲许多国家。全世界以及亚洲各国工会组织的代表也曾多次访问我国，亲眼看到了我国和平建设蓬勃发展、我国人民生活与文化水平稳步提高的事实。今年“五一”国际劳动节，许多国家的工会组织的代表应中华全国总工会的邀请来到北京，与中国工人阶级和全国人民一起欢度这个伟大的节日，这将进一步加强中国工人阶级与世界各国工人阶级的友好团结。
    工人阶级国内、国际的团结就是胜利的旗帜。各国工人兄弟们团结起来，就能使工人阶级争取改善生活、保卫工会与民主权利、争取与维护民族独立、保卫世界和平的事业走向胜利。
