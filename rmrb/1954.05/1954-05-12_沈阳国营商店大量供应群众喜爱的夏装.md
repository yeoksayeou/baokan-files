Shenyang state-owned stores have begun to supply a large quantity of summer clothing to city residents. The Shenyang City Company of the China Department Store, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, held a summer clothing exhibition in February, collecting more than 11,600 opinions. At the same time, they sent people to Harbin, Beijing, Tianjin and other places, as well as places with concentrated pedestrian traffic in the city, such as train stations, to collect new clothing styles. Based on the opinions of the masses, they organized relevant units to produce more than 350 kinds of clothing favored by the masses. Now, 108 kinds of new summer clothing have met with the broad masses of consumers.

The work of supplying summer clothing in Shenyang this year has begun to change the past situation of "no distinction between men's and women's clothing" and old-fashioned clothing styles, due to the widespread adoption of public opinion. Many kindergartens originally planned to set up sewing rooms to make their own summer children's clothing, but now most have abandoned this plan. Thirteen nurseries in the city have signed contracts with department stores to supply children's clothing.

In the past, the working people of Shenyang mostly wore black clothing, but now they prefer to buy blue and gray gabardine youth suits. In the department store clothing store alone, 1,661 sets were sold from April 20 to May 6. The store's sales volume in April increased by 80 percent compared with March. White poplin shirts, which were heavily overstocked in 1952, became bestsellers in 1953, and sales have expanded even further this year than last year. (Our Northeast Reporter Station)

    沈阳国营商店大量供应群众喜爱的夏装
    沈阳市国营商店开始大量供应市民夏季服装。中国百货公司沈阳市公司学习苏联的先进经验，曾在二月间举办了夏季服装展览会，征集了一万一千六百多条意见；同时派人到哈尔滨、北京、天津等地和市内行人集中的地方，如火车站等采集了一些新的服装样式。他们根据群众的意见，组织有关单位生产三百五十多种为群众喜爱的服装。现在有一百零八种新式夏装已和广大消费者见面。
    沈阳市今年供应夏季服装的工作，由于广泛采纳了群众的意见，开始改变了过去“男女服装不分”和服装样式老一套的情况。许多保育院原来计划设立缝纫室，自己作夏季童装，现在大都放弃了这个计划，全市已有十三个托儿所和百货公司签定了供应童装的合同。
    沈阳市劳动人民过去多穿黑色服装，现在都喜欢买蓝色和灰色的华达呢青年服；仅百货公司服装商店一个地方，从四月二十日到五月六日，就卖了一千六百六十一套。该商店四月份的销货量，比三月份上升百分之八十。白府绸衬衣，在一九五二年还大批积压，到一九五三年已成了畅销货，今年比去年销路就更加扩大。（本报东北记者站）
