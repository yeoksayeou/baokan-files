"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Edition No. 16

The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 16, 1954, has been published.

The main content of this issue is the commemoration of the 84th anniversary of Lenin's birth. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Leninism is the Powerful Ideological Weapon of Communist and Workers' Parties." The editorial points out: Lenin's name and Lenin's teachings have become the banner for progressive mankind around the world in their struggle for a new life and a bright future. Leninism summarized the experience of the world revolutionary movement, thereby helping Communist and Workers' Parties and the working class to more clearly recognize the great struggle goal of liberating the working people from social and national oppression. Communist and Workers' Parties are armed with the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, knowledge of the laws of social development, and knowledge of the laws of political struggle, and therefore are able to correctly assess the situation and correctly determine their strategy and tactics in the various events occurring in the world. The entire course of historical events, the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's more than fifty years of revolutionary struggle, and the revolutionary experience of Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries have all proven the great truth and vitality of Leninism. The editorial then states: Leninism is a living, creative doctrine that is constantly developing and constantly improving; it is constantly enriching itself with the experience of new class struggles and with new principles and conclusions formulated in accordance with specific historical situations. Communist and Workers' Parties unswervingly follow the principles of Marxism-Leninism and creatively apply these principles based on the characteristics of nations and national states. Because of their loyalty to Leninism, their iron-like unity, and their inseparable connection with the masses, Communist and Workers' Parties are constantly achieving victories in the struggle for the interests of the working people and against the open and hidden enemies of bourgeois ideology and the working class, and will continue to achieve victories.

Important articles published in this issue include: "The Great Vitality of Lenin's Ideas on the Worker-Peasant Alliance" by Krutina, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "Struggle for the Unity of the Swedish Working Class" by Backström, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Sweden; "The 50th Anniversary of the Founding of 'l'Humanité'" by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; and "The Call of the French Nation" by André Stil, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and Editor-in-Chief of "l'Humanité."

Krutina's article points out: Lenin's great idea of the alliance between the working class and the working peasantry is one of the basic theories of Leninism regarding the proletarian revolution, a part of the overall issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, one of the basic conditions for the victory and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and also one of the basic conditions for building a communist society. The development of the People's Democratic system in Czechoslovakia to its current level and the economic achievements obtained due to the heroic labor of the working people and the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union fully demonstrate that the creative application of the Soviet Union's experience in building socialism and the implementation of Lenin's policy on the worker-peasant alliance are indispensable for all countries engaged in socialist construction. At the initiative of the Party Central Committee, the government has put forward tasks to be strived for in the coming period, which is to further improve the living standards of the working people on the basis of proportionally developing the national economy, especially by developing the raw material base and power base of heavy industry, increasing the output of the food industry and light industry, and doing everything possible to increase agricultural output. Completing these tasks will further strengthen and consolidate our People's Democratic system and strengthen the alliance between the working class and the working peasantry. To complete these tasks of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, it is necessary to greatly develop agriculture. This is because the slow development of agriculture has had an adverse impact on the entire national economy, hindering the development of industry.

Backström's article points out: In all its political activities, the Communist Party of Sweden strives to achieve the unity and solidarity of the working class. Communists, Social Democrats, and non-party workers are increasingly convinced from their own experience that only unified action can ensure victory. The leaders of the right-wing Social Democrats are enemies of the unified action and solidarity of the working class. They see the unity of the working class as a threat to their own position. However, no one can undermine the strengthening of the unity and solidarity of the Swedish working class. The foundation of this increasingly strengthened solidarity is their consistent demands, so all difficulties can be overcome. The article emphasizes: With the increasing activity of workers, the Communist Party, as the vanguard of the Swedish working class, has a particularly important task. The Communist Party of Sweden will overcome its own shortcomings and draw on the rich experience of other fraternal parties to consolidate and expand its achievements.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第十六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十六期已经出版。
    本期的主要内容是纪念列宁诞生八十四周年。本期以“列宁主义是共产党和工人党的强大的思想武器”为题发表社论。社论指出：列宁的名字和列宁的学说已成为全世界进步人类为新生活、为光明的前途而斗争的旗帜。列宁主义总结了世界革命运动的经验，从而帮助共产党、工人党和工人阶级更清楚地认识到从社会压迫和民族压迫下解放劳动人民的伟大的斗争目标。共产党和工人党是以战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的学说、社会发展规律的知识和政治斗争规律的知识武装起来的，因而能够在世界上发生的各种事件中正确地判明局势，正确地决定自己的战略和策略。历史事件的全部过程，苏联共产党五十年以上革命斗争的经验以及各国共产党和工人党的革命经验都证明了列宁主义学说的伟大真理和生命力。社论接着说：列宁主义是活的、创造性的学说，它在不断地发展、不断地趋于完善；它在不断地以新的阶级斗争的经验、以随着具体的历史形势而制定的新的原理和结论来丰富自己。共产党和工人党始终不渝地遵循着马克思列宁主义的原则，根据民族的特点和民族国家的特点创造性地运用这些原则。共产党和工人党由于忠于列宁主义，由于钢铁般地团结一致和与群众有不可分割的联系，在争取劳动人民的利益、反对资产阶级思想和工人阶级的公开和隐蔽的敌人的斗争中，正不断地取得胜利，而且将继续取得胜利。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记克鲁蒂纳的“列宁关于工农联盟的思想的伟大生命力”，瑞典共产党中央委员会政治局委员巴克什特罗姆的“为瑞典工人阶级队伍的统一而斗争”，法国共产党总书记多列士的“‘人道报’创刊五十周年”，法国共产党中央委员会委员、“人道报”总编辑安·斯梯的“法国民族的呼声”。
    克鲁蒂纳的文章指出：列宁关于工人阶级和劳动农民联盟的伟大思想，是列宁主义关于无产阶级革命的基本理论之一，是无产阶级专政总的问题中的一部分，是无产阶级专政取得胜利并获得巩固的基本条件之一，也是建设共产主义社会的基本条件之一。捷克斯洛伐克人民民主制度发展到今天这样的程度以及由于劳动人民的英雄般的劳动和苏联的兄弟般的援助所获得的经济成就，充分证明创造性地应用苏联建设社会主义经验和实行列宁主义关于工农联盟的政策，对所有进行社会主义建设的国家，都是不可缺少的。在党中央委员会的倡议下，政府已提出了今后一段时期要努力完成的任务，这就是在按比例发展国民经济的基础上，特别是以发展重工业的原料基地和动力基地，增加食品工业和轻工业的产量，并尽一切办法提高农业产量，来保证进一步提高劳动人民的生活水平。完成这些任务，就会进一步加强并巩固我们的人民民主制度，就会加强工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟。而要完成加强工农联盟的这些任务，就必须大大地发展农业。这是因为农业发展的缓慢对整个国民经济起了不良的影响，阻碍着工业的发展。
    巴克什特罗姆的文章指出：瑞典共产党在自己的全部政治活动中都力求实现工人阶级队伍的统一和团结。共产党、社会民主党和无党派的工人根据自身的经验越来越深信，只有采取统一行动才能确保胜利。右翼社会民主党的领袖们是工人阶级统一行动和团结的敌人。他们把工人阶级的团结看成对他们自己的地位的威胁。但是，没有任何人能够破坏瑞典工人阶级队伍的统一和团结的加强。这种日益加强的团结的基础是他们的要求一致，因此可以克服一切困难。文章着重说：在工人的活动日益加强的情况下，作为瑞典工人阶级的先锋队的共产党有着特别重大的任务。瑞典共产党将克服本身存在的缺点，吸取其他兄弟党的丰富经验，来巩固和扩大自己的成就。　（新华社）
