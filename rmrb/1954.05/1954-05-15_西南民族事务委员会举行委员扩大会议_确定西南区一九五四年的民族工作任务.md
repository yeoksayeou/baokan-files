    The Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Southwest Administrative Committee held its Fifth Members (Expanded) Meeting from May 4th to 11th. In addition to the members of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, representatives from sixteen ethnic groups including Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Dai, Hani, Buyi, Hui, and Dong, leading cadres from various ethnic autonomous regions, and leading figures with ties to their ethnic peoples attended the meeting. The heads of the Chongqing Office of the Dalai Lama of Tibet and the Chongqing Office of the Panchen Lama of Tibet also attended the meeting. Representatives from relevant departments of the Southwest Party, government, and military also participated in the meeting.
    At the meeting, Wang Weizhou, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Administrative Committee and Chairman of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, delivered a report on the general tasks of the state during the transition period and the general tasks of the state in the transition period regarding national issues. He pointed out that socialist industrialization is the highest interest of the people of all nationalities in China. Only with national industrialization can the people of all minority nationalities receive more assistance and further the political, economic, and cultural development of all nationalities. Therefore, the people of all nationalities must strengthen unity between and within nationalities on the basis of progress, adhere to the policy of long-term cooperation with national leaders who are connected to the people, and gradually transition to socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party. Sun Yuting, Deputy Chairman of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, gave a report on the state of nationalities work in the Southwest Region.
    The meeting summarized the nationalities work in the Southwest Region in 1953 and determined the nationalities work tasks for 1954. The meeting held that the nationalities work in the Southwest Region is in line with the spirit of the state's general tasks during the transition period and has achieved new successes. At present, seventeen ethnic groups with a population of 4.4 million in the region have achieved ethnic regional autonomy. In the first year of the state's planned construction, ethnic areas in the Southwest that started work earlier have shifted from political work to a stage that emphasizes both political and economic work, and various economic tasks have developed. In agricultural production, the People's Government has distributed more than 170 billion yuan in agricultural loans and more than 1.3 million pieces of free agricultural tools to various minority ethnic areas, and has helped minority ethnic farmers improve their farming techniques, enabling farmers to generally achieve bumper harvests. The People's Government has also planned to develop transportation and add state-owned trading organizations in minority ethnic areas, increasing the purchase and supply of various products by more than double compared to 1952. This has gradually improved the economic lives of the people of all nationalities and further strengthened the unity of the people of all nationalities. Other cultural, educational, and health work has also developed accordingly.
    The meeting analyzed the current situation of nationalities work in the Southwest Region in detail, and based on the state's general tasks in the transition period regarding national issues, proposed the nationalities work tasks for 1954 as: continuing to implement the policy of ethnic regional autonomy; vigorously developing production, and developing economic work related to production in a planned way; strengthening and consolidating the unity between and within nationalities, vigorously cultivating and improving ethnic cadres; correspondingly developing cultural, educational, and health undertakings; and strengthening investigation and research work in ethnic areas. The meeting pointed out that economic construction work in ethnic areas is the fundamental work to gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities left over by history, and all localities should take all effective measures to strengthen this work in a step-by-step and planned manner according to local conditions. The unity between and within nationalities is the prerequisite for realizing the state's general tasks in the transition period regarding national issues, and all work must start from the unity of nationalities and achieve the goal of unity. The meeting finally emphasized that in order to successfully complete the nationalities work tasks for 1954, all work must be carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the policy of "prudence and steady progress" must continue to be implemented. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西南民族事务委员会举行委员扩大会议
    确定西南区一九五四年的民族工作任务
    西南行政委员会民族事务委员会在五月四日到十一日举行了第五次委员（扩大）会议。出席会议的除西南民族事务委员会委员外，还有藏、彝、苗、傣、哈尼、布依、回、侗等十六个民族的代表、各民族自治区的领导干部和与本民族人民有联系的领袖人物。西藏达赖驻重庆办事处和西藏班禅驻重庆办事处的负责人也出席了会议。参加会议的还有西南党、政、军各有关部门的代表。
    会上，西南行政委员会副主席、西南民族事务委员会主任委员王维舟作了国家过渡时期总任务和过渡时期国家在民族问题方面的总任务的报告。他指出：社会主义工业化是我国各民族人民的最高利益。只有国家工业化，各少数民族人民才能得到更多的帮助，更有利各民族人民政治、经济和文化的发展。因此，各族人民必须在进步的基础上，加强民族之间和民族内部的团结，坚持和与人民有联系的民族领袖人物的长期合作的方针，在共产党的领导下，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。西南民族事务委员会副主任委员孙雨亭作了关于西南区民族工作情况的报告。
    会议总结了西南区一九五三年的民族工作，确定了一九五四年的民族工作任务。会议认为：西南区的民族工作是符合于国家过渡时期总任务的精神的，并取得了新的成就。目前，全区已有十七个民族，四百四十万人口地区实现了民族区域自治。在国家进行有计划建设的第一年，西南工作开展较早的民族地区，已由政治工作转向政治和经济工作并重的阶段，各项经济工作都有了发展。在农业生产上，人民政府给各少数民族地区发放了一千七百多亿元的农业贷款和一百三十多万件无偿农具，并帮助少数民族农民改进耕作技术，使农民普遍得到丰收。人民政府并在少数民族地区有计划地发展了交通运输和增设了国营贸易机构，使各种产品的收购和供应比一九五二年增加了一倍多。这就逐步改善了各族人民的经济生活，进一步加强了各族人民的团结。其他文教卫生等工作也有了相应发展。
    会议详细分析了当前西南区民族工作情况，根据过渡时期国家在民族问题方面的总任务，提出了一九五四年的民族工作任务为：继续贯彻民族区域自治政策；大力发展生产，并有计划地发展和生产有联系的经济工作；加强和巩固民族之间和民族内部的团结，大力培养和提高民族干部；相应地发展文教卫生事业；加强民族地区的调查研究工作。会议指出：民族地区的经济建设工作，是逐步消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上不平等的根本工作，各地应有步骤、有计划地根据当地不同条件，采取一切有效的措施加强这一工作。各民族之间和各民族内部的团结，是实现过渡时期国家在民族问题方面总任务的前提条件，一切工作都要从民族团结出发，达到团结的目的。会议最后着重指出：为胜利完成一九五四年民族工作任务，各项工作都必须在中国共产党的领导下进行，必须继续贯彻“慎重稳进”的方针，党的领导是一切工作胜利的根本保证。　（新华社）
