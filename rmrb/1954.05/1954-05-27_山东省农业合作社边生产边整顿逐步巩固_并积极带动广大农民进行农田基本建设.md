Xinhua News Agency report:

    Shandong Province's more than 15,800 agricultural production cooperatives have generally been consolidated through production and rectification, and have played a leading role in carrying out basic farmland construction.

    There were only 1,201 agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province last year. Since last winter and this spring, more than 14,600 new ones have been established. In order to strengthen leadership over the newly established cooperatives, various localities have universally held mutual aid and cooperation training classes. According to statistics from the four special districts of Liaocheng, Changwei, Wendeng, and Tai'an, more than 47,000 people had been trained by the end of April. Now, all newly established cooperatives in the province have been equipped with leading cadres and accounting personnel. During the spring ploughing production, the local CCP committees, in accordance with the principle of combining production and rectification, went deep and specifically to help the newly established cooperatives to carry out rectification and consolidation. After rectification, the newly established cooperatives in various localities generally democratically elected management committees, formulated production plans, and established production teams or production groups. Some cooperatives also implemented a piece-rate system, strengthened financial management, and regularly announced work points and expenditure accounts. Some of the regulations on land and labor dividends, which were not reasonable at the beginning of the establishment of the cooperatives, have been largely resolved through democratic consultation. Therefore, the newly established cooperatives in various localities have universally and rapidly put themselves into spring ploughing production and have gradually consolidated in production, while also driving the improvement and development of mutual aid teams.

    This year, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province have generally played a leading role in basic farmland construction. In the heavy clay, sandy and mountainous areas of Wendeng, Laiyang, Linyi, Dezhou and the Zibo industrial and mining area, peasants, under the leadership of local agricultural production cooperatives, have carried out soil-sand exchange, opened mountain springs, and repaired terraced fields and slow-flow dams this year. The scale of farmland construction is unprecedented. In the coastal and low-lying areas of Jining, Liaocheng, and Huimin special districts, the peasants are also generally repairing ditches and constructing raised fields and terraced fields. In areas with existing water conservancy facilities, agricultural production cooperatives have generally increased the number of new wells this year. According to very incomplete statistics from ten special districts, more than 539,000 terraced fields have been repaired; more than 90,000 drainage ditches have been dug, slow-flow dams have been built, and field dams and river dikes have been repaired. Among them, the more than 1,500 drainage ditches repaired in Linyi Special District alone can prevent waterlogging on 190,000 mu of farmland this year. According to statistics from 444 agricultural production cooperatives in Junan County, more than 10,500 mu of land have been improved by various methods this year, accounting for more than two-tenths of the total spring land area of each cooperative. Based on the local estimate that improving the soil can increase grain production by 70 jin per mu, these more than 10,500 mu of land can harvest an additional 730,000 jin of grain this autumn. In Wendeng Special District, one-half to two-thirds of the peanut and sweet potato land in agricultural production cooperatives has been deeply ploughed by hand this year. According to local farmers' experience over the years, ploughed land can increase peanut production by 50 jin per mu and sweet potato production by 200 jin per mu.

    山东省农业合作社边生产边整顿逐步巩固
    并积极带动广大农民进行农田基本建设
    据新华社讯：山东省一万五千八百多个农业生产合作社，经过边生产边整顿普遍得到巩固，并在进行农田基本建设上起了带头作用。
    山东全省去年只有农业生产合作社一千二百零一个。去冬今春以来，新建了一万四千六百多个。为了加强对新建社的领导，各地普遍举办了互助合作训练班。据聊城、昌潍、文登、泰安四个专区统计，到四月底止，就训练了四万七千多人。现在全省新建社都已配齐领导干部和会计人员。在春耕生产中，各地中共党委又根据边生产边整顿的方针，深入地具体地帮助新建社进行整顿和巩固。经过整顿后，各地新建社一般都民主选出了社务管理委员会，制订了生产计划，建立了生产队或生产小组。有些社还实行了按件包工制度，加强了财务管理，定期公布工分和开支账目。对建社初期土地、劳力分红等规定不够合理的地方，经过民主协商已大部得到合理解决。因此，各地新建社普遍迅速投入了春耕生产，并在生产中逐渐巩固，同时也带动了互助组的提高和发展。
    全省的农业生产合作社，今年在农田基本建设中普遍起了带头作用。在文登、莱阳、临沂、德州等专区和淄博工矿区的重粘土地、散沙地和山岭地，农民们在当地农业生产合作社的带头下，今年进行土沙互换，开凿山泉，修理梯田和缓水坝等农田建设，规模为往年所未有。在济宁、聊城、惠民等专区的沿海地区和低洼地区，农民们修理沟洫，筑台田、畦田的也很普遍。有水利基础的地区，农业生产合作社今年普遍增打了新井。据十个专区极不完全的统计，修理梯田即达五十三万九千多道；挖排水沟，修缓水坝，修护田坝和河堤等九万多道
  （条）。其中临沂专区修的一千五百多条排水沟，今年就可免除十九万亩农田的涝灾。莒南县据四百四十四个农业生产合作社的统计，今年用各种办法改良了一万零五百多亩地的土壤，占各社春地总面积的十分之二强。根据当地往年改良土壤后一亩地可增产粮食七十斤推算，这一万零五百多亩地今年秋季就可多收获七十三万斤粮食。文登专区各地的农业生产合作社，今年有二分之一到三分之二的花生、地瓜地都用人工深刨了一遍。根据当地农民历年经验，刨过的地种花生每亩能增产五十斤，种地瓜能增产二百斤。
