A few days ago, I heard that Zanshan Village had not yet completed its cotton planting task, which I found quite strange.

Speaking of the Second District of Shahe County, Zanshan Village is an advanced village; especially in the western half of the district, this village is one of the best. In the past, in every movement, this village took the lead. This year, out of the 613 households in the village, 153 have joined agricultural production cooperatives (forming seven cooperatives), and 243 are in permanent mutual aid teams (a total of 33 teams). The vast majority of the rest have also organized temporary mutual aid teams. The village has 42 Communist Party members, about three-quarters of whom are relatively active, and 29 have joined cooperatives; among them, the township general branch secretary, Gao Hui, has always been conscientious and responsible; the branch secretary, Zhang Wanxing, is a veteran soldier, an old party member, and has consistently been active in his work; the deputy township head, Gao Cheng, is also an old party member and quite capable; and the township government secretary, Pei Gensuo, is also a good party member, selfless and has never succumbed to difficulties. The remaining thirteen party members are all in permanent mutual aid teams. Whether from the perspective of the party organization, the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, or the past work foundation, it must be said that this is a good village. However, in the recent cotton planting work, this village has fallen behind. In terms of planting area, the village planted 2,100 mu of cotton last year; this year, according to the state plan, it should be appropriately expanded, with an original plan to plant 2,600 mu; but recently, after a survey, the planned cotton planting area of each cooperative, each team, and each household added up to only 1,940 mu. Some small villages nearby with very few households have used the drought-resistant method of planting, and one village has already planted hundreds of mu; this village has more than 600 households, and the cotton planting is not considered much, and many are using cultivators. While other villages have completed their planting, this village still has a large portion of its land unplanted. What is going on?

After going to the village, it turned out that the problem lay in the relaxation of leadership over the mutual aid teams. The seven cooperatives have basically completed their plans, but the mutual aid teams have not been mobilized.

In the past, party members were active in the mutual aid teams; when there was any work to be done, the party members would take the lead in action and mobilize ideologically in the teams, and the whole village would act. Last winter, the better mutual aid teams were transformed into agricultural production cooperatives, and many party members also joined the cooperatives; there were fewer party members remaining in the mutual aid teams, and the party's leadership was also weakened. In the spring, the higher authorities repeatedly pointed out that emphasizing cooperatives was correct, but mutual aid teams could not be neglected; the district committee also repeatedly reminded each township and village branch to pay attention to the fact that cooperatives should drive the mutual aid teams, and the mutual aid teams should drive the individual farmers. The cadres of this township also knew this; and the branch committee members also divided the work, stipulating who would lead which mutual aid team. However, knowing was knowing, and assigning work was assigning work, but they just didn't do it. Gao Cheng was originally assigned to lead four mutual aid teams in addition to running the cooperative well. When I asked him about the planting situation of several teams, he said: "They have all soaked the seeds and are taking action!" After checking several teams, only one team had soaked the seeds, and the remaining three teams hadn't even held a single meeting. People in the teams said: You haven't even come to see us, and we don't know what to do. One mutual aid team had already disbanded, and the township cadres didn't even know about it. Why does this problem still occur when we keep shouting "Emphasizing cooperatives cannot neglect mutual aid teams?"

It should be admitted that the fault lies first with our district committee. We only conveyed the instructions from the higher authorities downward regarding how to emphasize cooperatives without neglecting mutual aid teams, but lacked specific research and specific leadership; for villages like Zanshan Village, we always thought that there wouldn't be any problems, and we relaxed our leadership somewhat. In normal times, we couldn't see any problems; but when the spring plowing and planting movement began, the problems were revealed.

From the branch's perspective, why did they only care about the cooperatives and abandon the teams?

Village branch secretary Zhang Wanxing said to me: "You're just talking! If the cooperatives collapse, we have to take responsibility! The higher authorities have said so many times that running cooperatives is doing socialist work, and every one we run must be successful. How dare I let go of such a big thing?"

Deputy township head Gao Cheng said: "I'm in whichever cooperative, and I'll guarantee to run that cooperative well, and that will be considered completing the task assigned to me by the party. Leading the mutual aid teams is a matter for the whole village; if the whole village doesn't do well, it's the responsibility of all the village cadres, mainly the responsibility of the cadres who are detached from production. The cadres who are detached from production get a subsidy of 150,000 yuan a month, so they should do more work. Don't call me to village meetings so often in the future; I'm not detached from production, and there are many things to do in the cooperative, so I can't leave." The detached cadres said: "Is it a crime to get 150,000 yuan? Take this 150,000 yuan and divide it among yourselves!" Several village cadres all thought and acted like this: you run your cooperative, I run my cooperative; if the cooperative is run well, we can harvest more grain, distribute more dividends, and receive praise, which will both earn us more work points and show off ourselves, "gaining both fame and fortune."

They also said: Without high mountains, the plains cannot be seen; if the mutual aid teams are also run well, how can the superiority of the cooperatives be shown? There must be some distinction!

From these words, the fundamental reason for abandoning the mutual aid teams is that the main cadres in the township and village have ideological problems. They don't understand that running the mutual aid teams well is also part of the socialist transformation, and they don't understand that in order to develop agricultural production cooperatives, the mutual aid teams must also be run well; at the same time, they are also mixed with individualistic emotions, pursuing personal glory and personal gain, lacking collectivist spirit and a sense of the overall situation.

Because the main party cadres in the township and village have such thoughts, the general party members and the masses have also developed erroneous understandings. The thirteen party members in the mutual aid teams, seeing that the mutual aid teams were being looked down upon, were also not active. Wang Jiguang said: "Our mutual aid teams don't get any attention. Cooperatives are still better. Leading the mutual aid teams well isn't very glorious either."

From the perspective of the work style and work methods of the main cadres in the township and village, there are also problems.

They all said: We can't pull ourselves away! The affairs of the cooperatives are difficult to handle, and we are anxious but have no way to solve them. In reality, from the township general branch secretary Gao Hui on down, several main cadres are blindly doing some daily routine work in the cooperatives every day, even taking on the tasks of assigning work and recording work points, unable to give play to everyone's strength and concentrate the wisdom of the masses. Several main cadres also rarely discuss things together. The more they are entangled in the trivial affairs of the cooperatives, the less time they have to hold meetings to study problems. When it is necessary to convene a branch committee or branch general meeting, it is always difficult to gather everyone until after 10 o'clock at night; some people simply don't attend the branch meetings. They say: Work is tight, and the tasks are so heavy, how can we have time to hold meetings? When the higher authorities assign work, they have to convene expanded cadre meetings and mass meetings; they use these meetings to replace party meetings, reducing the party members to the level of the general peasants. At these meetings, the cooperative members are always late because they are "busy" with the cooperative's scoring, recording work points, assigning work, etc.; when the meetings are held, the cooperative cadres always say: Let's adjourn the meeting quickly, we have to go back and study the problems of the cooperative! Therefore, the main cadres speak and then the meeting is adjourned, and no one is mobilized to discuss. Holding meetings for the sake of holding meetings like this solves no problems.

In this way, even good experiences of some cooperatives cannot be shared. For example, the fourth cooperative led by Pei Gensuo, the labor force is used reasonably, the five or six party members in the cooperative are united, consult with each other, and consolidate the cooperative very well; they were the first in the whole village to start planting cotton, and all 34 households in the cooperative planted more than 200 mu, and it was completed long ago. However, they were neither praised nor did anyone pay attention to their experience. If good experiences cannot be promoted to other cooperatives, everyone is still blindly busy; and the good experiences that already exist are not easily enriched and improved.

In this way, the branch also abandoned political and ideological education work for party members and the masses. Branch meetings for learning, criticism, and self-criticism, which were originally scheduled to be held twice a month, have not been held once in a month and a half. They say: Learning and education are matters for the winter; when spring gets busy, how can we take care of these things? On the village's blackboard newspaper, there are still old materials from the general election in February. This village is divided into ten sections, with ten rooftop loudspeakers, and another general loudspeaker. In the past, these loudspeakers echoed each other, playing a considerable role in propaganda and mobilization. Now, only one is still in use, and it is only used to call people to meetings. Propaganda work has no leadership, and no propaganda materials are supplied, so it has stagnated. The cooperatives originally stipulated that they would give political lessons twice a month, but it has also been a long time since they were given.

Because the cooperatives are busy and political education work has been abandoned, the masses outside the cooperatives are dissatisfied with the cooperatives, and some cooperative members' thoughts are also unstable. Because cooperative members are always late for mass meetings, the masses outside the cooperative reflect: Saying the cooperatives are good, just taking holding meetings as an example is discouraging! Song Keming, the village's civil affairs director, became so busy in the cooperative after joining that he didn't even do the things within his responsibilities as civil affairs director. When people had disputes and asked him to mediate, he "pushed everything away": "Go to the township government, I can't even figure out the affairs of our cooperative!" The masses are also very dissatisfied with this. The mutual aid teams are not energetic, the socialist atmosphere in the whole village is thin, the cooperatives are somewhat isolated, and some cooperative members have become shaken again.

I participated in their branch committee meeting, made a self-criticism of the shortcomings of the district committee's leadership, and studied ways to improve with them.

One, improve leadership methods. The village's cooperative and mutual aid committee, composed of the branch committee and twelve other selected party members, will lead the cooperatives and teams in a planned and comprehensive manner, exchanging experiences between cooperatives and between teams. When important problems occur in the cooperatives, concentrate efforts to solve the problems of the cooperatives; after studying and devising solutions, still hand them over to the cooperative's chairmen, captains, etc. to do, and no longer directly take care of them by the township cadres; under normal circumstances, the affairs of the cooperatives should rely on the chairmen, accountants, and captains to do, and spare a certain amount of effort to pay attention to leading the mutual aid teams. The branch committee should specifically study the problems of the cooperatives and teams once a month.

Two, firmly grasp political and ideological education work. First of all, budget the cooperatives' production increase accounts and each household's cooperative member income accounts, summarize the superiority shown by the cooperatives in the spring plowing and planting, and influence the mutual aid teams politically, driving the mutual aid teams. Branch meetings with learning, criticism, and self-criticism as the main content should be held on schedule, and currently the main content should be the study of the discussion in the Hebei Daily about the good party member Tian Jingxiu and the bad party member Qiao Duokui. The work of the blackboard newspaper and loudspeaker should also be restored, led by the deputy branch secretary and propaganda committee member, and materials should be supplied.

Three, give the mutual aid teams concrete help. The cooperatives have more agricultural tools, and there are cultivators for planting cotton that the mutual aid teams do not have. On the principle of not affecting the production of the cooperatives, they should be lent to the mutual aid teams to help the mutual aid teams complete the spring plowing and planting as early as possible.

Four, conduct patriotic production increase friendship competitions between cooperatives and cooperatives, cooperatives and teams, teams and teams, teams and teams within cooperatives, and members and members of cooperatives.

That evening, they first tried it out in one cooperative. The main cadres did not participate in the meeting, but only gave suggestions to the cooperative's backbone members on major issues, to see how the cooperative's affairs were actually handled. As a result, the cooperative did not make any mistakes in handling problems and arranging work. In the past, when the main township cadres were "in charge" of the cooperative, the people in the cooperative did not speak much, and listened to him command in a patriarchal manner. When he was not there, everyone spoke more actively. This made the main township cadres also realize: The cooperative was not actually unable to do anything without us. The main township and village cadres examined their own individualistic thoughts, and freed themselves from the daily trivial affairs of the cooperatives, and strengthened their leadership over the mutual aid teams. The next day, seven mutual aid teams started planting, and the rest of the mutual aid teams soaked the seeds. In this way, the village's cotton planting task was completed only two days later than the original plan. The township cadres said: If we hadn't corrected this, we don't know how long it would have taken to complete! Our place was originally a first-class township, but now it has actually become a second-class township. If we don't change, we will slowly become a third-class township, and that is already showing signs of happening. Zhang Wanxing said: If we don't reverse this situation, the mutual aid teams won't be run well, and the cooperatives won't be safe either. If the teams collapse, the cooperatives will become isolated, the masses will be dissatisfied, and how can the cooperatives be consolidated? It would be good if the district committee led us like this more often in the future.

    从一个村的棉花播种看“重社轻组”问题
    ——记中共河北省沙河县第二区委员会书记奚举的谈话
    前几天，听说赞善村还没有完成棉花播种任务，我觉得好奇怪。
    在沙河县第二区说起来，赞善村是个先进的村子；特别在西半区的几个乡，这个村是数得着的。往年，在每个运动里边，这个村都占先。今年，全村六百一十三户里边，已经有一百五十三户加入了农业生产合作社（分别成立了七个社），还有二百四十三户在常年互助组里面（总共三十三个组），其余的绝大部分也都组织了临时互助组。村里有四十二个共产党员，工作比较积极的大约占四分之三，有二十九名入了社；其中乡总支书记高会的工作一向认真负责；支部书记张万兴是个转业军人，老党员，工作一贯积极；副乡长高成也是个老党员，挺有能力；乡政府秘书裴根锁也是一个好党员，大公无私，没向困难低过头。下剩的十三名党员都在常年互助组里。无论从党组织的情况来看，从互助合作组织的发展来看，从过去的工作基础来看，都得说这是一个好村子。可是，在最近的棉花播种工作方面，这个村却落后了。按播种面积来说，去年全村种棉花二千一百亩；今年要按照国家计划，适当扩大一些，原计划种二千六百亩；最近一调查，把各社各组各户计划种植棉花的面积加起来，才一千九百四十亩。附近有些户数很少的小村子，用抗旱点种的办法播种，一个村子已种了千百亩左右，这个村子六百多户，种棉又不算多，而且有很多是用耧耩的，在别的村已完成的时候，这个村还有大部分的地没有种上。这是怎么回事？
    到村里一看，原来问题就出在放松了对互助组的领导。七个社基本上已经完成计划了，互助组却还动不起来。
    往年，党员都在互助组里活动；有了什么工作，党员在组里从行动上一带头，从思想上一发动，全村就都行动起来了。去年冬天，比较好的互助组转成了农业生产合作社，很多党员也都入了社；留在互助组的党员少了，党的领导力量也削弱了。春天，上级一再指出，重社是对的，可是不能轻组；区委也一再提起各乡各村支部注意，社要带动互助组，互助组要带动单干户。这个乡的干部也知道这些；而且支部委员们还分了工，由谁领导哪个互助组也规定好了。可是，知道归知道，分工归分工，就是没有照着做。高成原来的分工是除了把社办好以外还领导四个互助组。我问他几个组播种的情形，他说：“都泡上籽了，行动着哩！”到几个组一检查只有一个组泡了籽，其余三个组连一次会还没开哩。组里的人说：你们连看也不来看看我们，我们也不知道该咋办哩。有一个互助组已经散了，乡干部还不知道。为什么老在喊“重社不能轻组”却仍然发生这样的问题呢？
    应该承认，毛病首先是出在我们区委身上。我们对于怎样才能重社而又不轻组这个问题，过去只是按照上级指示向下传达，却缺乏具体的研究和具体的领导；对于像赞善村这样的村子，总认为不会有什么问题，在领导上也有些放松。在平时，还看不出来有什么问题；到春耕播种运动一开始，问题就显露出来了。
    从支部来检查，为什么只顾社，把组撇开了呢？
    村支部书记张万兴对我说：“你光说哩，社垮了得负责任哩！上级说过多少次了，办社是办社会主义的事，搞一个就要成一个。这么大事，我还敢离手哩？”
    副乡长高成说：“自己在哪个社里，保证把哪个社办好，就算完成了党给的任务了。领导互助组是全村的事；全村的事干不好，是全村干部大伙的责任，主要是脱产干部的责任。脱产干部一个月拿十五万元的津贴，就该多做些事。以后村里开会，不要多叫俺了；我没脱产，社里事多，离不开。”脱产干部就说：“拿十五万元就算有罪了？把这十五万元拿去，大家分分吧！”几个乡村干部都是这样想、这样做：你搞你的社，我搞我的社；社搞好了，能多打粮，多分红，受表扬，既能多挣工分，又能显出自己来，“功利两得”。
    他们还说：没有高山，显不出平地；要是把互助组也都搞好了，这还能显出社的啥优越性哩？就得有些分别！
    从这些话来看，抛开互助组的根本原因，是乡和村的主要干部思想上有问题。他们还不了解办好互助组也是社会主义改造事业的一部分，不了解要想发展农业生产合作社就必须把互助组也办好；同时还夹杂着个人主义的情绪，追求个人光荣、个人有利，缺乏集体主义的精神和全局观点。
    因为乡村主要党员干部有这样的思想，一般党员和群众也就产生了错误的认识。在互助组的十三个党员，看到互助组被看轻，也不积极了。王继光说：“我们互助组，怎么也不沾。还是社好。把互助组领导好也不怎么光荣。”
    从乡村主要干部的工作作风和工作方法来看，也有问题。
    他们都说：拔不出腿来啊！社里的事难整，干着急没办法。实际上，从乡总支书记高会的起，几个主要干部每天都是在社里盲目地做一些日常事务工作，连派活、记工的事都包揽起来，不能发挥大家的力量和集中群众的智慧。几个主要干部也很少在一起商量。越是缠搅到社里的琐碎事务里边，也就越没时间开会研究问题。要开支部委员会、支部大会，总是不到夜里十点以后找不齐人；有的人，干脆就不参加支部会了。他们说：工作紧，任务这么重，还顾得上开会？上级布置了工作，不能不开会，才召开扩大干部会和群众大会；他们就用这些会代替了党内的会，把党员降低到一般农民群众的水平。在这些会上，社员们因为“忙”社里的评分、记工、派活等等事情，老是去得晚；开会的时候，社里的干部还总是说：快散会吧，我们还要回去研究社里的问题哩！因此，主要干部说了话就散，也不发动大家讨论。这样为开会而开会，啥问题也没解决。
    这样，有的社有好经验也不能交流。像裴根锁领导的第四社，劳力使用得合理，社内五六个党员团结一致，互相商量，把社巩固得很好；在全村最先开始播种棉花，全社三十四户，种了二百多亩，早已种完了。可是，他们既没有受到表扬，也没人注意他们的经验。有好经验推广不到别的社去，大家就还是盲目地忙乱着；已经有的好经验，也不容易更充实、更提高。
    这样，支部对党员和群众也都放弃了政治思想教育工作。进行学习、批评和自我批评的支部大会，原来规定每月开两次，已经有一个半月没开一次了。他们说：学习、教育是冬天的事；春天忙起来了，还顾得上这些？村子里的黑板报上，还写着二月间普选时候的旧材料。这个村分十片，有十个屋顶广播筒，另外有一个总的广播筒。过去，这些广播筒一个喊，十个接，起了相当大的宣传鼓动作用。现在，只剩一个还用着，只是开会叫人。宣传工作没人领导，宣传材料没人供给，就停顿起来了。社里原来也规定每月上两次政治课，也很久没上过了。
    因为社里忙乱，加上放弃了政治教育工作，社外群众就对社不满意，有些社员的思想也就不稳定了。因为开群众大会时社员老是到得晚，社外群众就反映：说社好，光拿开会来说就不提气！村里的民事主任宋克明入社后在社里忙得不得了，连民事主任分内的事也不干了。人家有了纠纷找他调解，他就“一推六二五”：“去找乡政府吧，俺社里的事还弄不清哩！”群众为这也很不满。互助组不带劲，整个村子里的社会主义空气稀薄了，社有些孤立了，有些社员也就又动摇起来了。
    我参加了他们的支委会，向他们检讨了区委领导的缺点，和他们一起研究了改进的办法。
      一、改进领导方法。由支委和挑选出的另外十二名党员组成村里的合作互助委员会，有计划地通盘地领导社和组，交流各社之间、各组之间的经验。社里发生重要问题的时候，集中力量解决社里的问题；研究出办法来仍然交给社里的社长、队长等去做，不再由乡干部直接包办；在一般情况下，社里的事要依靠社长、会计、队长去做，分出一定的力量经常注意领导互助组。支委会每月要专门研究一次社和组的问题。
    二、抓紧政治思想教育工作。首先是预算社里的增产账和各户社员的收入账，总结社在春耕播种中表现出来的优越性，从政治上影响互助组，带动互助组。以进行学习、批评和自我批评为主的支部大会要按期开，当前以学习河北日报上关于好党员田景秀、不好的党员乔多奎的讨论为主要内容。黑板报、广播筒的工作也要恢复起来，由支部副书记和宣传委员负责领导，供给材料。
    三、给互助组以具体帮助。社里农具比较多，有耩棉花用的耧是互助组里没有的，要在不影响社的生产的原则下借给互助组用，帮助互助组提早完成春耕播种。
    四、社和社、社和组、组和组、社内的队和队、社员和社员之间要开展爱国增产友谊竞赛。
    当天晚上，就先在一个社试了一试，主要干部不参加会，只在主要问题上对社里的骨干提示一下意见，看社里的事究竟办得怎样。结果，社里处理问题、安排工作也没出什么岔子。过去有乡主要干部在社里“把着”的时候，社里的人都不大发言，听他一个人家长式地指挥。他不在，大家发言反倒积极了。这一来，乡主要干部也觉悟了：社里原来并不是离了咱就啥也干不成。乡和村的主要干部检查了自己的个人主义思想，又从社内的日常琐碎事务中脱了身，就加强了对互助组的领导。第二天，就有七个互助组开始播种了，其余的互助组也都泡上籽了。这样，这个村的棉花播种任务只比原定计划迟两天完成。乡干部们说：要是不纠正，还不知道要拖到啥时候才能完成呢！我们这里原来是头类乡，现在实际上已经成了二类乡了。再不改，慢慢就会变成三类乡，已经露出这样的苗了。张万兴说：要是不扭这一下子，互助组搞不好，社也不保险。组垮了，社孤立起来，群众不满意，社还能巩固？以后区委多像这样领导我们就好了。
