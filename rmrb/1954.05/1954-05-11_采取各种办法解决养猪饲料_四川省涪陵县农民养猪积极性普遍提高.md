    Taking Various Measures to Solve Pig Feed Problems
    Farmers in Fuling County, Sichuan Province, Generally Increase Enthusiasm for Pig Raising
    In order to help farmers solve the problem of pig feed, many villages in Fuling County, Sichuan Province, held meetings of women, experienced pig farmers, and others in early spring to summarize the masses' experience of using less grain and more substitutes to feed pigs, and promoted it among the masses, correcting the erroneous view of some people that "pigs cannot be fattened without grain." For example, when Nanpu Township promoted the successful experience of pig-raising model Li Chengxuan in mixing bran and chaff to feed pigs, many people thought it would not work. The leadership first used the eight pigs of the Li Chengxuan mutual aid group to experiment. The results proved that: baking the bran and chaff, grinding it finely, sifting it, and mixing it with grain, and then chopping the pig grass finely, washing it clean, and cooking it, would eliminate any odd taste. The pigs loved to eat it, and the growth rate of the pigs greatly increased compared to before the experiment. Before the experiment, Cai Maoyun’s two pigs weighed 103 jin and grew an average of eight liang per day. The second pig weighed 93 jin and grew an average of three liang and two qian per day. After mixing in bran and chaff, the first pig grew an average of one jin, four liang, and two qian per day, and the second pig grew an average of one jin and three liang per day. As a result, many people began to accept this feeding experience. Beita Village also promoted the use of rapeseed cake to feed pigs, which reduced the consumption of food grains and fed the pigs very well. At present, more than ten kinds of plants have been discovered throughout the county that can be used as pig feed, such as wild rapeseed, sawtooth vine, redseed leaf, pumpkin leaves, and sweet potato leaves.
    While promoting the use of substitutes for pig feed, the Monopoly Bureau allocated more than 630,000 jin of distillers' grains, the Grain Bureau allocated 178,300 jin of wheat bran, more than 500,000 jin of rice bran, and more than 900,000 jin of miscellaneous grains to supply farmers as pig feed. The bank also issued more than 40 million yuan in pig-raising loans to support farmers in raising pigs. At present, the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs has greatly increased, and the number of pigs in the county has increased by 10 percent compared with the annual output of 360,000 in 1953.

    采取各种办法解决养猪饲料
    四川省涪陵县农民养猪积极性普遍提高
    四川涪陵县为了帮助农民解决养猪饲料，许多乡村在春初都召开了妇女、养猪能手等会议，总结群众少用粮食多用代用品喂猪的经验，并在群众中推广，纠正了有些群众认为“没有粮食喂不肥猪”的错误看法。如南浦乡推广养猪模范李成轩渗用糠壳喂猪的成功经验时，许多群众都认为不行，领导上就首先以蔺成才互助组的八条猪来试验，结果证明：把糠壳炕熟、磨细、过筛渗和在粮食里，再把猪草切细、淘净、煮熟，这样就没有杂味，猪很爱吃，猪的生长率较试验前大大提高。蔡茂云两条猪试验前第一条原重一百零三斤，每天平均长八两，第二条原重九十三斤，每天平均长三两二钱；掺和糠壳饲养后，第一条猪每天平均长一斤四两二钱，第二条猪每天平均长一斤三两。因之许多群众开始接受了这种饲养经验，北塔村还推广菜油饼喂猪，既减少了食粮的消耗，猪也喂的很好。目前全县已发现野油菜、锯锯藤、红子菜及南瓜叶、苕叶等十多种植物可以作猪饲料。
    在推广用代用品喂猪的同时，专卖局又拨出酒糟六十三万多斤、粮食局拨出麦麸皮十七万八千三百斤、米糠五十万余斤、杂粮九十多万斤供应农民作喂猪饲料，银行并发放养猪贷款四千多万元，扶助农民养猪。目前群众养猪积极性大大提高，全县猪只比一九五三年年产三十六万只增加了百分之十。　　　（林屏山）
