    A Group of Tibetan Youths from Tibet Come to the Mainland to Study
    Recently, another group of over fifty Tibetan youths from the Tibet region have come to the motherland's mainland to study. Among them, fourteen people departed from Lhasa on May 3rd, and the rest will set off one after another soon. At the farewell party, Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme of the Tibet Local Government, and the parents and relatives of the youths, unanimously encouraged the youths to unite and make progress, and to study hard to build a new Tibet.
    The youths also carried letters, hadas (ceremonial scarves), and other items of comfort, preparing to express their regards to the People's Liberation Army and Tibetan laborers participating in the construction of the Kangzang Highway.
    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, youths in the Tibet region have been actively requesting to come to the mainland to study. There are now more than seventy Tibetan youths studying in the mainland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西藏一批藏族青年来内地学习
    西藏地区最近又有五十多名藏族青年前来祖国内地学习。其中十四人已在五月三日从拉萨出发，其余不久也将陆续启程。在欢送会上，西藏地方政府噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美和青年们的家长亲友们都一致勉励青年们团结进步，努力学好本领建设新西藏。
    青年们还携带了信件、哈达等慰问品，准备慰问参加修筑康藏公路的人民解放军和藏族民工。
    自从西藏和平解放以后，西藏地区的青年纷纷要求来内地学习，现在已在内地学习的藏族青年有七十多人。（新华社）
