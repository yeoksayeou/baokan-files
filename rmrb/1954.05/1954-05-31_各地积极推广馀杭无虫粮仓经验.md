Various Localities Actively Promote the YuHang Insect-Free Granary Experience

The experience of the YuHang County People's Government Grain Bureau in Zhejiang Province in creating a large number of insect-free granaries has attracted the attention of grain departments in various localities. Grain departments throughout Zhejiang Province have widely launched a wave of learning from YuHang County's experience in creating insect-free granaries. Grain departments in various special districts, counties, and cities have sent representatives to YuHang County for visits and learning. After the grain storage personnel of YuHang County initiated a challenge to grain departments across the province in March, aiming to ensure all grain stored in the county this year would be insect-free, grain departments in various localities responded enthusiastically. Grain storage personnel in Hangzhou City proposed establishing a regular cleaning and sanitation system and striving to make 70% of the granaries insect-free this year. The grain stored in Jiaxing Special District this year has high moisture content, and some grain storage personnel originally lacked confidence in doing a good job in grain storage. After the YuHang County grain storage personnel initiated the challenge, all employees of the grain departments in the entire special district actively participated in sun-drying grain and proposed to make half of the granaries insect-free this year. Grain departments across the province, in conjunction with grain quality surveys and sun-drying grain, vigorously carried out cleaning and sanitation work.

After representatives from grain departments in Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places visited and learned from YuHang County, they generally conducted widespread publicity and communication through meetings, business publications, and the like. Some have already drafted specific plans, grasped the key points, and launched promotion work. Many grain storage personnel in these areas, through on-site visits and listening to reports, and studying documents, have overcome conservative ideas such as "it is impossible for granaries to be insect-free," and have increased their confidence in doing a good job in grain storage. Grain departments in Suzhou Special District and Yancheng Special District in Jiangsu Province have specifically proposed indicators for creating insect-free granaries. After many granaries in Huayang in Wangjiang County, Caishi and Huangchi in Dangtu County, Anhai in Jinjiang County in Fujian Province, and Mudu District in Wu County, Jiangsu Province, applied the YuHang County experience, warehouse insects are already few, and some have even become insect-free granaries. Many granaries that were originally called "dust halls" and "dirty warehouses" have taken on a new look after thorough cleaning. In addition to the provinces and cities mentioned above that sent people to YuHang County for visits, many grain departments in Shanxi, Western Liaoning, Sichuan, Ningxia, Beijing, Taiyuan, and other places are also actively learning from the YuHang County experience in creating insect-free granaries.

    各地积极推广馀杭无虫粮仓经验
    浙江省馀杭县人民政府粮食局创造大批无虫粮仓的经验，已引起各地粮食部门重视。浙江省各地粮食部门已广泛掀起学习馀杭县创造无虫粮仓经验的热潮。各专区、县、市的粮食部门都派代表到馀杭县进行了参观、学习。馀杭县粮食保管人员在三月间以争取今年全县仓贮粮食无虫的条件，向全省粮食部门发起做好粮食保管工作的挑战以后，各地粮食部门纷纷应战。杭州市粮食保管人员提出要建立经常的清洁卫生制度，争取在今年内使百分之七十的粮仓成为无虫粮仓。嘉兴专区今年贮存的粮食水分很大，有些粮食保管人员原来对做好粮食保管工作缺乏信心，馀杭县粮食保管人员发起挑战以后，全专区粮食部门的职工都积极投入了晒粮工作，并提出要在今年使半数粮仓成为无虫粮仓。全省粮食部门结合粮质普查、翻晒粮食，大力开展了清洁卫生工作。
    安徽、福建、江苏、山东、湖南、广东、上海、广州等地粮食部门派代表到馀杭县参观、学习以后，一般都通过会议、业务刊物等广泛进行了宣传、传达，有的已拟出具体计划，掌握重点，展开推广工作。这些地区的许多粮食保管人员通过实地参观和听取传达，学习文件，克服了认为“粮仓不可能没有虫”等保守思想，提高了做好粮食保管工作的信心。江苏省苏州专区、盐城专区等地的粮食部门，已具体提出创造无虫粮仓的指标。安徽省望江县的华阳、当涂县的采石、黄池以及江苏省吴县的木渎区、福建省晋江县的安海等地，有不少粮库运用馀杭县经验以后，仓虫已经很少，有的且已成为无虫粮仓。许多原来被称为“灰堂”、“脏库”的粮仓，经过彻底扫除，已经面貌一新。除上述派人到馀杭县参观的省、市以外，山西、辽西、四川、宁夏、北京、太原等地，也有许多粮食部门在积极学习馀杭县创造无虫粮仓的经验。
