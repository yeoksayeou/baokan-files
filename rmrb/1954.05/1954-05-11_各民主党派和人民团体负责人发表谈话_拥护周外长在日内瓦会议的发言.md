China Association for Promoting Democracy Chairman Ma Xulun
    【Xinhua News Agency, 9th】Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, issued a statement endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference.
    Ma Xulun said: The speeches of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il at the Geneva Conference reflect the sincere wishes and common demands of all awakened Asian people and peace-loving people around the world. We firmly support and fully endorse them.
    Ma Xulun also fully agreed with the proposal put forward by DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il and supported by Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, saying: The peaceful unification of Korea should be achieved on the basis of free elections throughout Korea without foreign interference. He said: The three proposals on the repatriation of prisoners of war put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his speech on May 3 are also very reasonable.
    Ma Xulun said: The liberation of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam further proves that the imperialist colonial policy is completely on the verge of bankruptcy, and the era when imperialism relied on force to rule Asia has completely become a thing of the past. We believe that with the collective efforts of awakened people to maintain peace and security, lasting peace in Asia and the world can be guaranteed.
China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Chairman Zhang Bojun
    【Xinhua News Agency, 9th】Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, issued a statement supporting the just propositions put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference.
    Zhang Bojun said: The proposals made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the issue of Asian peace, as well as the three solemn suggestions on the issue of prisoners of war, fully conform to the will of the entire Chinese people and are also completely consistent with the interests of the people of the world. Obviously, these proposals and suggestions point out the correct path to consolidate Asian peace and ease international tensions.
    Zhang Bojun said: We fully endorse the peaceful diplomatic policy announced by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on behalf of our country and are willing to work for its realization. We also fully endorse the speeches and statements of Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il, and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong.
    Zhang Bojun pointed out: The American imperialists are still continuing their conspiracy of sabotage against this solemn conference. They vainly attempt to piece together the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Security System" or "Southeast Asia Anti-Communist National United Front," attempting to further interfere in the Indochina War in order to establish their new colonial rule in order to prepare for a new world war. However, these aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism are doomed to a shameful failure. The liberation of Dien Bien Phu on May 7 once again proved to the world that the standing-up Vietnamese people cannot be defeated, and the era when imperialists wanted to run rampant in Asia, bullying and enslaving the people of Asian countries, is gone forever. However, we will not relax our vigilance in the slightest.
China Zhi Gong Party Chairman Chen Qiyou
    【Xinhua News Agency, 10th】Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, issued a written statement endorsing the solemn propositions put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference for the cause of peace.
    Chen Qiyou said: Although the Geneva Conference has only been going on for a dozen days, the attitudes of the aggressive bloc that violates the interests of the people and the peace forces that safeguard the interests of the people have already presented a clear division at this conference. U.S. representative Dulles's speech at the conference, in addition to repeating some old and worn-out slanders against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, openly refused all the suggestions on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue put forward by Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il, which were supported by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Contrary to this arrogant and unreasonable attitude of the United States, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai proposed at this conference to withdraw all foreign troops in Korea, including the righteous anti-aggression Chinese People's Volunteers, and let the Korean people solve their own domestic affairs; advocated withdrawing and removing all foreign troops and military bases in Asia; and advocated restoring peace in Indochina. He also opposed the illegal and forcible detention of prisoners of war by the U.S.-Rhee clique; opposed the United States' occupation of our Taiwan, the revival of Japanese militarism, and attempts to organize so-called Pacific "common security" systems and joint actions in Southeast Asia. All these propositions or oppositions are all reasonable and thus have been warmly welcomed and supported by the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world.
    Chen Qiyou said: We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's fair and just propositions and express our heartfelt thanks and respect to him and all the comrades of our delegation. At the same time, we also deeply realize that the Geneva conference is only the beginning, and there will be many compromises in the struggle between peace and anti-peace. American imperialism is still continuing to find ways to sabotage this conference. We must pay attention to any conspiracy of the United States and its followers with a hundredfold vigilance, so that their tricks from all aspects will not succeed, in order to achieve the noble goal of defending Asian peace and world peace.
Jiusan Society Chairman Xu Deheng
    【Xinhua News Agency, 10th】Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, issued a statement endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference.
    Xu Deheng said: The Geneva Conference, which the people of the world are eagerly awaiting, has been open for two weeks. This is a historic meeting. The Chinese people are closely watching the progress of this conference, hoping that it will make valuable contributions to the cause of easing international tensions and consolidating world peace.
    We fully endorse the two speeches made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference. Foreign Minister Zhou's righteous voice has moved all honest, conscientious, and upright people in the world, especially the people of Asia. Foreign Minister Zhou has put forward fair, reasonable, and constructive opinions on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and on issues related to peace and security in Asia and the world. These opinions not only express the Chinese people's desire for peace but also conform to the interests of all the people of Asia and the world. We would like to solemnly tell the American imperialists who are now trying to establish colonial rule in Asia that today is not the 19th century, nor is it the early 20th century. After the end of the Second World War, especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Asia has undergone fundamental changes. In today's era, the Asian people have mastered their own destiny and are firmly fighting for their freedom and independence. Historical facts have proven that no force can save the failure of the bloody colonial policy.
    Due to the American imperialists' frantic pursuit of aggressive policies, our country's legitimate status and rights in international affairs have been subjected to undue discrimination, our territory of Taiwan is still occupied, and our peace and security are often threatened. The peaceful settlement of the Korean issue is still hindered and sabotaged, more than 48,000 POWs from Korea and China are still being forcibly detained, and recently the U.S. government has further interfered in Indochina, and is using this to instigate the organization of the West Pacific and Southeast Asia aggressive blocs. All of these are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and all the people of Asia. We fully support the solemn demand made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference, "These aggressive actions of the United States should be stopped, and peace in Asia should be guaranteed." "Asian countries should consult with each other and make joint efforts to maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually assuming corresponding obligations." We believe that under the wise leadership of their government and Chairman Mao Zedong, no force can stop the Chinese people from victoriously advancing on the road to prosperity and happiness.
Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Beijing Office Spokesperson
    【Xinhua News Agency, 10th】The spokesperson of the Beijing Office of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a statement endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference, demanding the crushing of the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism.
    The spokesperson said: The people of the world are paying attention to the progress of the Geneva Conference. All peace-loving people in the world are eagerly expecting the Geneva Conference to negotiate peaceful solutions to the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina, thereby further easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    The spokesperson said: The speech by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of our delegation, fully expressed the Chinese people's will to seek to consolidate peace in Asia and the world, and once again clarified to the world the peaceful diplomatic policy pursued since the founding of the People's Republic of China. We warmly endorse and support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference and all the efforts made by the delegation at the conference to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
    The spokesperson particularly pointed out: Because the US warmongering clique hates our country, fears peace, and is obsessed with the policy of using force to dominate the world, it launched the Korean War and at the same time occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan, seriously threatening our country's independence and security. At this Geneva Conference, the United States disregarded the proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il and fully supported by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov, and openly stated that it was unwilling to withdraw American troops in Korea, hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea; it plotted to expand the Indochina War, attempting to organize a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc; and continued to occupy our territory of Taiwan. These conspiracies and tricks of the United States should arouse a hundredfold vigilance in us. We must work together with the peace-loving people of the world to completely shatter this series of conspiracies of American imperialism in order to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League Head
    【Xinhua News Agency, 9th】The head of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League said on the 9th regarding the Geneva Conference: The entire Chinese people and youth, like the people of the world, are paying very close attention to the progress of the conference and are looking forward to the conference achieving good results. The speech made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the conference fully explained the fundamental principles of our country's foreign policy, and also fully expressed the consistent will of the Chinese people and youth to love peace and oppose war. We do not invade others, and we resolutely oppose any act of aggression by anyone; we do not threaten others, and we resolutely oppose any act of threat by anyone; we do not interfere in the internal affairs of others, and we resolutely oppose others interfering in the internal affairs of anyone. The entire Chinese youth fully supports the speeches of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il at the conference and the statement by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, and will work with the people of the whole country to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina.
All-China Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Lai Ruoyu
    【Xinhua News Agency, 10th】Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, issued a statement on the Geneva Conference on the 10th, representing the Chinese working class in firmly endorsing and supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference.
    Lai Ruoyu said: The basic task of the Geneva Conference is to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Since the opening of the conference, the righteous and stern speech made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the conference has announced our country's peaceful diplomatic policy, demonstrated the Chinese people's firm will to seek peaceful solutions to international disputes through negotiation, and reflected the sincere wishes of the peace-loving people of all Asia. Our All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese working class firmly endorse and support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech.
    We also express our firm endorsement and support for the speeches of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il at the conference, and believe that the proposals made by Foreign Minister Nam Il should be the basis for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    The issue of restoring peace in Indochina discussed at this conference is directly related to the vital interests of all the people of Indochina, and of course the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government should be invited to participate. We fully support the declaration of the Cambodian Resistance Government and the Laotian Resistance Government regarding sending representatives to participate in the Geneva Conference. Their sacred right to send representatives to participate in the conference should not be deprived. We also firmly endorse and support the speech of Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong at the conference.
    We firmly oppose American imperialism and its followers sabotaging the Geneva Conference. We firmly oppose the conspiracies and activities of American imperialism to instigate the organization of aggressive blocs, expand aggressive wars, and endanger peace in Asia and the world. We firmly believe that under the condemnation and opposition of the peace-loving people of the world, these conspiracies and activities will be shamefully defeated!
Head of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    【Xinhua News Agency, 10th】The head of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement on the Geneva Conference, saying: I represent all the women of China, expressing my complete endorsement and full support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference. These speeches fully illustrate the unwavering peace policy of our government, and correctly, centrally, and specifically express the demands and wishes of our people and women for maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and for protecting the happiness and safety of women and children.
    The statement said that all the women of China are closely concerned about and watching the progress of the Geneva Conference, firmly support the propositions of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister Molotov, Foreign Minister Nam Il, and Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong, and are determined to take practical actions to support all the efforts made by our delegation at the Geneva Conference. We will always be vigilant against the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, and will resolutely struggle to smash the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, to strive for the Geneva Conference to achieve good results, and to defend peace in Asia and the world.
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Chairman Chen Shutong
    【Xinhua News Agency, 9th】Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement on the 9th, endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the Geneva Conference.
    Chen Shutong said: The people of Asia, like the people of the world, love peace and freedom. However, peace and security in Asia have been seriously threatened. The Korean issue has not been resolved, the Indochina war has not stopped, China's territory of Taiwan has been occupied, and Japanese militarism is being revived. This is all the result of the American ruling clique's aggressive and expansionist policy of establishing colonial rule in Asia, interfering in national independence movements, and enslaving the Asian people. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech at the conference sternly pointed out that the US aggressive policy is the root cause of the tense and uneasy situation in Asia, and expressed the common desire of the Asian people. This is the upright and powerful voice representing more than 500 million people in China, and also represents the opinions of the Asian people and peace-loving people all over the world. The Asian people, who firmly control their own destiny and are determined to fight for their freedom and independence, are determined to fight for peace and security in Asia.
    Chen Shutong said: We fully endorse and support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech, and believe that if the countries participating in the conference can sincerely address international disputes in the interests of consolidating Asian and world peace and security, then the Geneva Conference will be able to achieve the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, thereby easing the tense situation in Asia and the world and helping to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

    各民主党派和人民团体负责人发表谈话
    拥护周外长在日内瓦会议的发言
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦
    【新华社九日讯】中国民主促进会主席马叙伦发表谈话，拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。
    马叙伦说：我国外交部部长周恩来、苏联莫洛托夫外长、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在日内瓦会议上的发言，反映了所有觉醒了的亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的忠诚愿望和共同要求，我们坚决拥护并全力支持。
    马叙伦也完全赞同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相所提出而为莫洛托夫外长、周恩来外长所支持的主张，他说：恢复朝鲜的和平统一应以全朝鲜人民在不受外国干涉的情况下进行自由选举为基础来实现。他说：周恩来外长在五月三日发言中就遣俘问题提出的三项建议，也是非常合理的。
    马叙伦说：越南奠边府的解放，更加证明帝国主义的殖民政策已经完全濒于破产，帝国主义依靠武力统治亚洲的时代已经完全成为过去。我们相信：有了觉醒了的人民为维护和平与安全而作的集体努力，亚洲和全世界的持久和平是可以保证的。
  中国农工民主党主席章伯钧
    【新华社九日讯】中国农工民主党主席章伯钧发表谈话，支持周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上提出的正义主张。
    章伯钧说：周恩来外长提出的有关亚洲和平问题的主张，以及就战俘问题提出的三项严正的建议，完全符合全中国人民的意志，和全世界人民的利益也是完全一致的。显然，这些主张和建议，是指明巩固亚洲和平，缓和国际紧张局势的正确道路的。
    章伯钧说：我们完全拥护周外长代表我们国家所宣布的和平外交政策，并愿为其实现而努力。我们也完全拥护莫洛托夫外长，南日外务相，范文同代外长的发言和声明。
    章伯钧指出：美帝国主义者对于这个庄严的会议，是仍在继续其阴谋破坏活动，它妄想拼凑所谓“东南亚集体安全体系”，或“东南亚反共国家联合阵线”，企图对印度支那战争进行进一步的干涉，以建立其新的殖民统治，以便于准备新的世界战争。可是，美帝国主义的这些侵略阴谋，是注定要遭到可耻的失败的。五月七日奠边府的解放，就再一次向全世界证明，站起来的越南人民是不能被战胜的，帝国主义者想在亚洲横行霸道，欺侮和奴役亚洲各国人民的时代，已经一去不返了。但是，我们丝毫也不会放松警惕。
  中国致公党主席陈其尤
    【新华社十日讯】中国致公党主席陈其尤发表书面声明，拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上为和平事业所提出的严正主张。
    陈其尤说：日内瓦会议虽然才进行十几天，然而，违反人民利益的侵略集团的态度和维护人民利益的和平力量的态度，在这个会议上已经呈现出显明的分野。美国代表杜勒斯在会议上的发言，除了反复一些陈旧不堪的反对苏联、反对中华人民共和国的诽谤之外，竟公开拒绝为我周恩来外长和苏联莫洛托夫外长所支持的朝鲜南日外务相所提出关于和平解决朝鲜问题的词严义正的一切建议。和美国这种蛮横无理的态度相反，我国周恩来外长在这个会议上提出撤退包括正义的反侵略的中国人民志愿军在内的在朝鲜境内的一切外国军队，让朝鲜人民自己解决自己国内的事；主张撤退和撤除在亚洲的一切外国军队和军事基地；主张恢复印度支那的和平。他并反对美李集团违法强迫扣留战俘；反对美国侵占我国台湾，复活日本军国主义，企图组织所谓太平洋“共同安全”体系和东南亚联合行动等侵略行为。所有这些主张或反对的事都无不入情入理，因而得到全国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    陈其尤说：我们完全拥护周外长公平严正的主张，并向他和我国代表团的全体同志们致以衷心的感谢和敬意。同时，我们也深刻认识到，日内瓦的会议仅仅才是开始，和平与反和平的斗争还会有不少的折冲。美国帝国主义还在继续设法破坏这个会议。我们一定要以百倍的警惕来注视美国和它的追随者们的任何阴谋，使它们从各方面施出的伎俩都无从得逞，以达到保卫亚洲和平和世界和平这一崇高的目的。
  九三学社主席许德珩
    【新华社十日讯】九三学社主席许德珩发表谈话，拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。
    许德珩说：全世界人民热烈期待的日内瓦会议开幕已经有两周了。这是一个历史性的会议。中国人民密切注视着这一会议的进展，希望它在缓和国际紧张局势、巩固世界和平的事业中作出有价值的贡献。
    我们完全拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的两次发言。周外长正义的声音，感动了全世界正直的有良心、有骨气的人们，尤其是亚洲人民。周外长对于朝鲜问题的和平解决以及有关亚洲和世界的和平与安全问题，都提出了公正合理的建设性的意见，这些意见不仅表达了中国人民和平的愿望，也是符合全亚洲和全世界人民的利益的。我们愿意正告现在正力图在亚洲建立殖民统治的美帝国主义者，今天已经不是十九世纪，也不是二十世纪的初叶，第二次世界大战结束以后，特别是中华人民共和国成立以后，亚洲已发生了根本的变化。在今天这个时代，亚洲人民已掌握了自己的命运，并坚决地为他们的自由与独立而斗争。历史事实证明，任何强力都是不能挽救血腥的殖民政策的失败的。
    由于美帝国主义者疯狂地推行侵略政策，使我国在国际事务中的合法地位和权益受到不应有的歧视，我国领土台湾还被侵占，我国的和平和安全还经常受到威胁，朝鲜问题的和平解决还受到阻挠和破坏，四万八千多名朝中战俘人员还被强迫扣留，最近美国政府又对印度支那进行进一步的干涉，并借此策动组织西太平洋和东南亚侵略集团。所有这些，都是使中国人民以及全亚洲人民所万分不能容忍的。我们完全拥护周外长在日内瓦会议上所提出的庄严要求，“美国的这些侵略行动应该被制止，亚洲的和平应该得到保证”。“亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全”。我们相信，中国人民在自己的政府和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，任何力量也阻止不了我们向富强、幸福的道路胜利前进。
    台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处发言人
    【新华社十日讯】台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处发言人发表谈话，拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言，要求粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋诡计。
    发言人说：全世界人民都注意日内瓦会议的进行。全世界爱好和平的人们都热烈地期待日内瓦会议能协商出和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的办法，从而进一步缓和国际紧张局势，巩固亚洲和世界和平。
    发言人说：我国代表团首席代表周恩来外长的发言，充分表达了中国人民谋求巩固亚洲和世界和平的意志，又一次向全世界阐明自中华人民共和国成立以来所奉行的和平外交政策。我们热烈拥护和支持周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言以及代表团在会议上为巩固亚洲和世界和平所作的一切努力。
    发言人特别指出：由于美国好战集团仇视我国，害怕和平，执迷于武力称霸世界的政策，发动了朝鲜战争，同时侵占了我国的神圣领土台湾，严重地威胁了我国的独立和安全。在这次日内瓦会议上，美国竟不顾南日外务相所提出而为周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长所完全支持的建议，公然表示不愿撤退在朝鲜的美国军队，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一；阴谋扩大印度支那战争，企图组织东南亚侵略集团；并继续占领我国领土台湾。美国这些阴谋诡计，应引起我们百倍警惕，我们一定要和全世界爱好和平的人民一道努力，彻底粉碎美帝国主义这一系列的阴谋，以巩固亚洲和世界和平。
  中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会负责人
    【新华社九日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会负责人九日就日内瓦会议发表谈话说：全中国人民和青年同世界人民一样，都在非常关切地注视着会议的进行，期待着会议能够获得良好的结果。我国周恩来外长在会议上的发言，充分说明了我国外交政策的根本方针，也充分表达了中国人民和青年一贯爱好和平和反对战争的意志。我们不侵略别人，也坚决反对任何人的侵略行为；我们不威胁别人，也坚决反对任何人的威胁行为；我们不干涉别人的内政，也坚决反对别人干涉任何人的内政。全中国青年完全拥护我国周恩来外长、苏联莫洛托夫外长、朝鲜南日外务相在会议上的发言和越南范文同副总理的声明，并将和全国人民一道，为谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决和恢复印度支那的和平而努力。
  中华全国总工会主席赖若愚
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国总工会主席赖若愚十日就日内瓦会议发表谈话，代表中国工人阶级坚决拥护和支持周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。
    赖若愚说：日内瓦会议的基本任务是讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题。开会以来，我国外交部周恩来部长在会议上的义正词严的发言，宣布了我国的和平外交政策，显示了中国人民以协商方式寻求和平解决国际争端的坚强意志，并反映了全亚洲爱好和平人民的真诚愿望。我们中华全国总工会和中国工人阶级坚决拥护和支持周恩来外长的发言。
    苏联莫洛托夫外交部长和朝鲜南日外务相在会议上的发言，我们也同样表示坚决的拥护和支持，并认为南日外务相提出的建议应作为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础。
    这次会议上所讨论的恢复印度支那和平问题，是直接关系着印度支那全体人民的切身利益问题，当然应该邀请高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府参加，我们完全支持高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府关于派遣代表参加日内瓦会议的声明，他们派代表参加会议的神圣权利不应被剥夺，我们也同样坚决拥护和支持越南民主共和国范文同副总理兼代外长在会议上的发言。
    我们坚决反对美帝国主义及其追随者破坏日内瓦会议。我们坚决反对美帝国主义策动组织侵略集团、扩大侵略战争、危害亚洲及世界和平的阴谋活动。我们深信在全世界爱好和平人民的谴责和反对之下，这些阴谋活动必将遭到可耻的失败！
  中华全国民主妇女联合会负责人
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会负责人就日内瓦会议发表谈话说：我代表全中国妇女，表示完全拥护并全力支持周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。这些发言，充分说明了我国政府的坚定不移的和平政策，正确地、集中地、具体地表达了我国人民和妇女对维护亚洲和世界和平、保卫妇女儿童的幸福与安全的要求和意愿。
    谈话说，全中国妇女，正密切关怀和注视着日内瓦会议的进行。坚决拥护周恩来外长、莫洛托夫外长、南日外务相和范文同副总理兼代外长的主张，并决心用实际行动来支持我国代表团在日内瓦会议上所作的各项努力。对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋随时保持警惕，坚决为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋、为争取日内瓦会议能获得良好的结果、为保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗。
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通九日发表谈话，拥护周恩来外长在日内瓦会议上的发言。
    陈叔通说：亚洲人民和世界其他各地人民一样，是爱好和平自由的。然而亚洲的和平与安全遭到了严重威胁。朝鲜问题未能解决，印度支那战火未能停止，中国的领土台湾被侵占，日本军国主义在复活，这都是由于美国统治集团在亚洲建立殖民统治、干涉民族独立运动、奴役亚洲人民的侵略扩张政策的结果。周恩来外长在会议上的发言，严正地指斥了美国的侵略政策是造成亚洲局势紧张和不安的根源，并表达了亚洲人民的共同愿望。这是代表中国五亿以上人民的正气磅礴的声音，也代表亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的意见。坚定的掌握着自己的命运并决心为自己的自由和独立而斗争的亚洲人民，是坚决要为亚洲的和平和安全而斗争的。
    陈叔通说：我们完全拥护和支持周恩来外长的发言，并且相信如果参加会议的各国都能诚意的本着巩固亚洲及世界和平和安全的利益，解决国际争端，那么，日内瓦会议就能够达到和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，从而使亚洲和世界的紧张局势得以缓和，有助于亚洲及世界和平的巩固。
