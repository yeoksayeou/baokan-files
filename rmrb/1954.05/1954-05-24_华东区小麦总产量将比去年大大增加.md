The wheat growth in East China is generally better than last year. In Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, wheat has generally reached the heading and flowering stage, and it is expected that production will increase compared to last year. Better areas may even reach or exceed the bumper harvest level of 1952. Wheat in Zhejiang Province is approaching the milky ripe stage and will be fully harvested by the end of May or early June. Wheat in Fujian Province has already been harvested. Although some areas of Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces suffered from late frost damage, the affected area was smaller and the damage was lighter than last year. After active rescue efforts, most of the wheat has recovered and resumed growth. Therefore, if there are no irresistible natural disasters in the future, the total wheat output in the region will increase significantly compared to last year.

The wheat in the state-owned mechanized farms is generally growing well this year. It is expected that the yield per unit area of wheat in the Dongxin State-owned Farm in Jiangsu Province, the Fangqiuhu State-owned Farm in Anhui Province, and the Shouxihu Farm will exceed the original plan. The wheat at Fangqiuhu Farm looks like a boundless green sea. The wheat cultivated by the Lishulan Mutual Aid Team near the farm using the farm's tractors is also growing very well. The farmers around the farm are very envious of machine-cultivated wheat.

The wheat of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places is generally better than that of individual farmers. Wu Changguo, an individual farmer in Qinhui District, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, has two mu of wheat fields located in the middle of the cooperative's land. It is estimated that he can only harvest 150 jin per mu, which is a 10% increase compared to last year, but 100 jin less than the cooperative. The Jianshe Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, estimates that the wheat planted on newly reclaimed land can yield 300 jin per mu, while individual farmers can only harvest up to 70 jin.

    华东区小麦总产量将比去年大大增加
    华东各地小麦生长情况一般都比去年好。山东、江苏、安徽三省小麦现已普遍抽穗扬花，预计都可比去年增产，较好的地区并可达到或超过一九五二年丰收的水平；浙江省各地小麦已届乳熟期，五月底六月初即可全部收割；福建省小麦已收割完毕。山东、安徽、江苏等省部分地区小麦虽曾一度遭受晚霜灾害，但受害面积较小，被害程度比去年为轻，且经积极抢救之后，大部已恢复生长，因此今后如无不可抗拒的自然灾害，全区小麦总产量将比去年大大增加。
    今年各国营机械农场的小麦，一般生长良好。江苏省国营东辛农场、安徽省国营方邱湖农场和寿西湖农场的小麦单位面积产量预计还可以超过原订计划。方邱湖农场的小麦长得像一片无边的绿海，该场附近李树兰互助组用农场拖拉机耕种的麦子，现在也生长得很好，农场周围农民都很羡慕机器耕麦。
    各地农业生产合作社和互助组的麦子，一般也比个体农民好。江苏省盐城县秦惠区秦惠农业生产合作社附近个体农民巫长国有二亩麦田，夹在该社土地中间，每亩预计只能收一百五十斤，虽比去年能增产一成，但比合作社却要少收一百斤。浙江省义乌县建设农业生产合作社在新开荒地上种的小麦每亩估计可收三百斤，而个体农民种的最多只能收七十斤。
