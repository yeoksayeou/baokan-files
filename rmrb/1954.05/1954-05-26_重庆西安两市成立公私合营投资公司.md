    The first joint public-private investment company in the Northwest Region, the Xi'an Investment Company, was approved by the Xi'an Municipal People's Government on May 8 and has begun operations. Xi'an Investment Company specializes in investing the surplus funds, conversion funds, and scattered social funds of private industrial and commercial enterprises into light industry. It does not directly operate any enterprises itself. Its investment is mainly in light industry that existing private industrial and commercial enterprises plan to convert into joint public-private ownership. However, when conditions permit, it will also invest in newly established joint public-private industries.
