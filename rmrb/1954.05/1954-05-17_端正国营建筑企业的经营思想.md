    Correcting the Business Ideology of State-Owned Construction Enterprises

    The recent Fifth Engineering Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering examined and criticized the tendency of certain construction engineering enterprises to set excessively high prices. Prior to and following this conference, major regional, provincial, and municipal construction engineering bureaus also exposed erroneous practices in local construction enterprises, such as “inflating labor and materials,” “raising unit prices,” and “re-evaluating transportation costs.” For example, in the first half of last year, three engineering companies under the Wuhan Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau made 19.3 billion yuan in profits from inflating labor and materials alone, accounting for 35.49 percent of the total material expenses; in some direct construction sites under the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau, profits from excessively high budgets accounted for 27.8 percent of the total profits; when an engineering team under the Northwest Construction Engineering Bureau contracted to build a clothing factory, they calculated the walls but not the doors and windows, earning an amount of bricks equal to one-sixth of the total project volume; the No. 1 Engineering Company of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau made 9 billion yuan in profits from building a 1.3 billion yuan simple warehouse for the Petroleum Company, accounting for 69.6 percent of the total cost. Some of these errors in overestimating costs are due to objective difficulties in accurately estimating prices, but some are due to the influence of capitalist business ideology on certain state-owned construction enterprises in their engineering budget work.
    Capitalist business ideology is fundamentally incompatible with the socialist nature of state-owned construction enterprises and violates the state's requirements for state-owned construction enterprises. Under the domination of capitalist business ideology, they do not control construction costs or promote the active adoption of new technological achievements by construction enterprises to reduce construction and installation costs; instead, they regard the capital construction investment of construction units as a tool for construction enterprises to pursue excessive profits. The evil consequence of this business ideology is, first of all, the accumulation and waste of national construction funds. The issue of funding is one of the fundamental issues determining the speed of China's socialist industrialization. The Party and the government require the people of the whole country to tirelessly carry out socialist accumulation and maximize the effectiveness of capital construction investment. However, some construction enterprises have taken measures that run counter to this. If every construction enterprise uses improper methods to raise prices, then even if the extra money earned by these construction enterprises is returned to the state treasury as profit at the end of the year and can be used for capital construction investment in the following year, this batch of funds has already traveled in vain for a year. During this year, due to the overestimation of costs, many construction units are unable to complete construction tasks according to the original investment plan, and a large amount of the state's limited materials are accumulated, causing many difficulties in the preparation of materials for other projects. Is this not a serious harm to the current construction cause?
    Since engineering costs are not budgeted according to realistic quotas and unit prices, there is no way to implement economic accounting, and naturally there will be no careful calculation or efforts to improve business management. As many construction enterprises have themselves examined, "business is capitalist, and management is based on the supply system." Some construction workers describe the waste and chaos on construction sites as "stepping on RMB when you enter the construction site" and "unattended warehouses, where you can take whatever you need." Naturally, this is not to say that all construction enterprises are like this, but because costs are too high, such decadent and backward phenomena in enterprise management are often concealed, and the motivation to continuously improve enterprise management is lost. Stalin pointed out in his speech at the Fifth All-Union Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League: "Industry based on very high prices is not and cannot be a real industry, because such industry must degenerate into a greenhouse plant, which has no vitality and cannot have vitality." This passage should attract our high attention.
    The erroneous business ideology of state-owned construction enterprises also leads to frequent disputes between construction units and contractors over cost issues, delaying the construction period. The No. 2 Engineering Company of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau contracted to build the Huazhong Three University Colleges project, which took seven months to sign the contract, and the start of construction was delayed by more than a month. Some capital construction units, in view of the excessively high costs, have organized self-operated projects. By the end of last year, there were more than 200 self-operated projects in the Central South region, and 40 percent of the projects in Changsha City were self-operated. These situations are obviously very unfavorable to the country's construction cause.
    It should be admitted that the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering and its affiliated construction engineering system is a relatively late-established new institution with a lack of basic work. Many veteran cadres in the construction engineering department are mostly recently transferred and lack experience and knowledge in business management, while the content of engineering construction is complex, the items of materials are numerous, the budget quotas are incomplete, and they are not completely realistic; the prices of materials purchased in the market are difficult to grasp; in addition, the country's construction cause has just begun, and many projects are designed and constructed at the same time. Therefore, it is objectively difficult to correctly determine the engineering budget. But we should never say that these objective difficulties are the main and entire reason for the overestimation of costs by some state-owned construction enterprises, nor should we use this to cover up the capitalist business ideology existing in the engineering budget work of some state-owned construction enterprises. Behaviors such as calculating walls without doors and windows, arbitrarily increasing the price of state-allocated materials, and individual construction enterprises making huge profits and demanding exemption from profit delivery cannot be explained by objective difficulties.
    The capitalist business ideology in the engineering budget work of state-owned construction enterprises has social reasons. Most of the state-owned construction enterprises grew up after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. A large part of its members come directly or indirectly from the former private construction industry. Many of them have made great progress through education, but many have not yet gotten rid of their past capitalist construction industry's set of business methods. When they prepare engineering budgets, they are either afraid of taking responsibility, fearing that if the materials are estimated too little or the price is estimated too low, they will lose money and be criticized; or they want to claim credit for making money, regardless of the overall interests of the country, and look for various "tricks" to increase costs. These decadent ideological consciousness and styles are toxins that corrode state-owned construction enterprises. But this is only one aspect of the problem. The other responsibility lies with the leading cadres of these state-owned construction enterprises. They have not deeply realized the organizational weakness of the enterprise; they have not deeply realized that if the personnel transferred from the past capitalist construction industry are not seriously educated ideologically and practically led in business, they will inevitably bring the capitalist business methods to state-owned enterprises, corrupt state-owned enterprises, and harm the interests of the country. Instead, they mistakenly regard engineering budget work as purely technical work, hand it over to old technical personnel without asking questions, and abandon leadership. More seriously, many leading cadres of construction enterprises also start from departmentalism and advocate "generous budgeting and strict use, rather high than low." They turn a blind eye to the wrong engineering budgets or support them implicitly or explicitly. These are the main reasons for the errors in the engineering budget work of state-owned construction enterprises.
    The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering and the construction engineering leading departments at all levels also bear important responsibility for the errors of overestimating labor and materials and raising unit prices in many construction enterprises under their jurisdiction. Although various parties have reflected on the capitalist business ideology in some construction enterprises, and the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering has also pointed it out, calling on everyone to pay attention to overcoming it, it has not seriously examined and specifically helped each construction enterprise to overcome it. The party organizations of the construction engineering department are also not doing enough in this regard. At the Fifth Engineering Conference, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering listed capitalist business ideology as the main problem existing at present, and conducted inspections and criticisms. Construction engineering bureaus and construction enterprises in many places also inspected and criticized capitalist business ideology. This is absolutely necessary.
    It should be pointed out that it is by no means only certain construction enterprises in the system of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering that have capitalist business ideology in their engineering budget work. The engineering budget work of construction enterprises in other central ministries also has this incorrect business ideology, but they contract their own capital construction projects through their own construction enterprises, and this ideology is not easy to expose or is not obvious. Therefore, all state-owned construction enterprises should correct their business ideology, deeply examine and criticize capitalist ideology, overcome departmentalism, strengthen the national overall concept and the ideology of socialist economic accounting, enrich the engineering budget institutions, and strengthen the leadership of engineering budget work. All departments should formulate some main and realistic economic quotas and material consumption quotas according to the different conditions of regions and various buildings, for the construction engineering units to adopt according to different regions and different buildings. For the prices and freight of certain materials that cannot be controlled in advance, they can be temporarily calculated at the usual price when preparing the budget, and adjusted according to the actual expenditure at the time of final settlement. It is strictly forbidden to inflate labor and materials, re-evaluate freight, and raise unit prices. The design department should gradually implement the preparation of design budgets to strengthen the control of the construction department. What is particularly important is that every construction enterprise must conscientiously implement the central government's instructions on reducing construction costs. Many construction engineering departments in various places have now formulated plans to reduce costs. Successfully completing this plan will not only ensure the accumulation of national construction funds, but also greatly advance the level of business management of construction enterprises.

### 端正国营建筑企业的经营思想

    端正国营建筑企业的经营思想
    中央建筑工程部最近召开的第五届工程会议，检查和批判了若干建筑工程企业造价过高的偏向。各大区及省、市建筑工程局，在这次会议前后，也曾揭发了各地建筑企业中“宽打工料”、“提高单价”、“重估运费”等错误行为。例如武汉市建筑工程局三个工程公司，去年上半年由于宽打工料，只在材料项内就赚了一百九十三亿元，占整个材料取费百分之三十五点四九；西南建筑工程局部分直属工地所得利润中，属于预算过高者就占百分之二十七点八；西北建筑工程局有一个工程队承包被服厂工程的时候，算墙不去门窗，赚了占工程总量六分之一的砖；中南建筑工程局第一工程公司承建石油公司简易仓库十三亿元的工程中，利润达九亿元，占总造价的百分之六十九点六。这种高估造价的错误，有些固然是由于客观上有许多困难不能准确地估价，但也有一些是由于某些国营建筑企业在工程预算工作中受了资本主义经营思想的影响。
    资本主义经营思想是和国营建筑企业的社会主义性质根本不相容的，是和国家对国营建筑企业的要求相违背的。在资本主义经营思想的支配下，他们不去控制建筑费用，促使建筑企业积极采用新的技术成就，来降低建筑安装成本，而是把兴建单位的基本建设投资当作建筑企业追求超额利润的工具。这种经营思想的恶果，首先就是积压和浪费了国家的建设资金。资金问题是决定我国社会主义工业化速度的根本问题之一，党和政府要求全国人民不倦地进行社会主义积累，最大限度地发挥基本建设投资的效果。但是某些建筑企业恰恰采取了与此背道而驰的措施。如果每一个建筑企业都用不正当的办法提高造价，那么，即使这些建筑企业多赚的钱到年终结算时又当着上缴利润都回到国库，还可以在第二年的基本建设投资时得到利用，可是这批资金也已经白白旅行了一年。在这一年中，由于高估造价，许多兴建单位既无法按原有的投资计划完成建设任务，又大量积压了国家有限的材料，使另一些工程备料发生许多困难。这难道不是对当前建设事业的严重危害吗？
    既然工程造价不是根据切合实际的定额和单价来预算的，当然就谈不到实行经济核算了，也就当然不会精打细算努力改进经营管理了。这正像许多建筑企业自己所检查的那样：“经营上是资本主义思想，管理上是供给制思想”。有些建筑工人形容工地上的浪费和混乱现象说，“上班进工地，脚踏人民币”、“无人管理仓库，可以各取所需”。自然这不是说所有的建筑企业都是如此，但是，由于造价过高，就常常掩盖了企业管理中这种腐朽的落后的现象，丧失了不断改进企业管理的动力。斯大林在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第五次全苏代表会议上的演说中曾指出：“奠基于很高价格的工业，并不是也不可能是真正的工业，因为这样的工业一定要退化成暖室里的植物，而这种植物是没有也不可能有生命力的。”这一段话，应该引起我们高度的注意。
    国营建筑企业的错误的经营思想，还使得建设单位和承建单位双方经常因为造价问题争执不休，拖延了建设期限。中南建筑工程局第二工程公司承包华中三大学院工程，就拖延了七个月才把合同订下来，开工时间推迟了一个多月。有些基本建设单位鉴于造价过高，纷纷组织自营工程。截至去年年底，中南区自营工程就有二百余处，长沙市有百分之四十的工程都是自营的。这些情况，对国家的建筑事业说来，显然也是十分不利的。
    应该承认，中央建筑工程部及其所属建筑工程系统，是一个成立较迟的新机构，工作缺乏基础。建筑工程部门的许多老干部，大都是转业不久的，缺乏经营管理的经验和知识，而工程建设内容复杂，材料项目繁多，预算定额不全，也还不完全切合实际；市场采购的材料价格又难以掌握；加上国家的建设事业还刚刚开始，许多工程一边设计，一边施工，因此正确地确定工程预算，客观上是有许多困难的。但决不应该把这些客观困难说成是某些国营建筑企业高估造价的主要原因和全部原因，也不应该以此来掩饰某些国营建筑企业工程预算工作中存在着的资本主义经营思想。诸如算墙不去门窗，擅自提高国家调拨物资价格，以及个别建筑企业盈利累累，还要求免缴上缴利润等等行为，都是无法以客观困难来解释的。
    国营建筑企业工程预算工作中的资本主义经营思想，是有社会原因的。大部分国营建筑企业是在“三反”、“五反”运动之后成长起来的。它的成员有很大一部分是直接或间接来自以前私人营造业的。其中许多人经过教育有很大的进步，但也有不少人尚未摆脱他们过去的资本主义营造业的一套经营方法。他们编制工程预算时，或则怕负责任，唯恐料估少了，价估低了，赔了本要受批评；或则以会赚钱来邀功，就不顾国家的整体利益，寻找各种提高造价的“窍门”。这些腐朽的思想意识和作风是腐蚀国营建筑企业的毒素。但这只是问题的一方面。另一方面的责任，还在于这些国营建筑企业的领导干部，他们没有深刻地认识到企业中这个组织上的弱点；没有深刻地认识到从过去资本主义营造业转来的人员，如果不在思想上加以认真教育，不在业务上加以切实领导，就必然会把资本主义的经营方法带到国营企业中来，腐蚀国营企业，违害国家利益。他们反而错误地把工程预算工作当作纯技术的工作，交给旧的技术人员而不闻不问，放弃了领导。更严重的是许多建筑企业的领导干部也是从本位主义思想出发，主张“宽打窄用、宁高勿低”的，他们对于错误的工程预算，抱着睁一只眼闭一只眼，或暗或明地予以支持的态度。这些就是产生国营建筑企业工程预算工作中错误的主要原因。
    中央建筑工程部及各级建筑工程领导部门，对所属许多建筑企业高估工料、提高单价等错误也是负有重要责任的。对于某些建筑企业中的资本主义经营思想，虽然各方面早有反映，中央建筑工程部也曾指出过，号召大家注意克服，但并没有认真检查和具体帮助各个建筑企业去克服它。建筑工程部门的党组织，在这一方面的监督工作也是不够的。第五届工程会议上，中央建筑工程部把资本主义经营思想列为当前存在的主要问题，进行检查和批判，许多地方的建筑工程局及建筑企业也检查和批判了资本主义经营思想。这是完全必要的。
    应该指出：在工程预算工作中存在着资本主义经营思想的，决不只是中央建筑工程部系统的若干建筑企业，中央其他各部建筑企业的工程预算工作中也同样存在着这种不正确的经营思想，只是他们是由自己的建筑企业来承包自己的基本建设工程，这种思想不容易暴露或暴露得不明显。因此，所有国营建筑企业都应该端正经营思想，深入检查和批判资本主义思想，克服本位主义思想，加强国家整体观念和社会主义经济核算的思想，并充实工程预算机构，加强对工程预算工作的领导。各部门应根据地区及各种建筑的不同条件，规定出一些主要的和切合实际的经济定额和材料消耗定额，供各建筑工程单位根据不同地区不同建筑分别采用。凡是事先无法控制的某些材料的价格和运费，在编制预算时可暂按通常价格计算，到决算时根据实际支出调整，严禁宽打工料、重估运费、提高单价等行为。设计部门应逐步实行编制设计预算，以加强对施工部门的控制。特别重要的是，各个建筑企业必须认真贯彻中央关于降低建筑成本的指示。各地许多建筑工程部门目前都已订出降低成本的计划，努力完成这个计划不仅可保证国家建设资金的积累，而且将使建筑企业的经营管理水平大大前进一步。
