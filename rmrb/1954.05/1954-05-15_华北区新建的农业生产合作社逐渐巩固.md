The more than 36,100 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in North China this year have mostly been consolidated, and the old cooperatives have also expanded to varying degrees. At present, there are more than 41,800 new and old agricultural production cooperatives in the region. The number of farmer households joining the cooperatives accounts for 6.9 percent of the total number of farmer households in North China. There are more than 1,400 large cooperatives with 50 to 100 households, and more than 300 large cooperatives with more than 100 households. In the process of establishing cooperatives, mutual aid teams have also greatly developed. According to statistics from eight counties including Gaoping in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, more than 140,000 farmer households participated in mutual aid teams last autumn. This year, in addition to some mutual aid teams being converted into agricultural production cooperatives, the number of farmer households participating in mutual aid teams increased to more than 190,000, an increase of about 35 percent. At present, the average number of farmer households organized in the region has increased from 50 percent last year to about 60 percent, and in advanced areas it has reached 80 to 90 percent.

North China originally planned to establish more than 17,000 new cooperatives before the spring plowing this year. Due to the deepening of the general line propaganda, the socialist consciousness of farmers has generally improved, and the superiority of old cooperatives in production has attracted farmers. The cooperative establishment plans in various places have greatly exceeded expectations. In order to ensure the healthy development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a special meeting in February to review the cooperative establishment situation and put forward the policy of stopping development and turning to consolidation. After the meeting, various localities immediately shifted their leadership focus to consolidation and conducted a general inspection and rectification of the newly established cooperatives. According to the rectification situation in Shanxi and Hebei provinces, 40 to 50 percent of the newly established cooperatives are completely consolidated; about 40 percent of the cooperatives have some problems, but they are basically consolidated; only about 10 percent or less of the cooperatives have more problems, and some of those that do not meet the conditions have been converted into mutual aid teams. Among the more than 7,000 new cooperatives established in Shanxi Province this year, most of them have been consolidated after rectification, and only 23 have been converted into mutual aid teams. According to statistics from more than 8,000 cooperatives in Hebei Province, only 172 cooperatives were converted into mutual aid teams due to unmet conditions, accounting for slightly more than 2 percent. These situations prove that the development of cooperatives in North China this year is basically good and healthy.

The rectification and inspection work of the new cooperatives in various places generally starts with organizing production, combined with spring plowing, first formulating or revising production plans, arranging production, and opening up ways to increase production, so that the cooperative members feel that they have a future after joining the cooperative. Before the rectification, 61 percent of the 1,001 cooperatives in Dingxian Special District of Hebei Province had no plans or only general plans without specific measures. After the rectification, more than 90 percent of the cooperatives formulated or revised plans, so that the newly established cooperatives were consolidated in production. Secondly, organizational rectification was carried out universally to purge the landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had sneaked into the cooperatives. Practical labor organization and financial management systems were established. Various localities have absorbed the experience of old cooperatives and promoted the contract system. According to statistics from more than 5,600 cooperatives in Shanxi Province, more than 400 cooperatives are experimenting with contracting for work and output, more than 2,300 cooperatives are contracting for work on a regular basis, more than 2,100 cooperatives are contracting for work temporarily, and only more than 700 cooperatives are assigning work temporarily. During the rectification process, various localities generally paid attention to combining political and ideological education, continuously improving the consciousness of cooperative members, reasonably resolving the unity between middle and poor peasants and between new and old cooperative members, resolving the issue of the distribution ratio of land and labor in the cooperatives, and dispelling the ideological concerns of cooperative members.

Adapting to the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives and the new situation of cadres lacking experience, various localities have generally carried out classification and ranking of newly established cooperatives during the rectification process. For the first and second categories of cooperatives with fewer problems, they have mostly adopted forms such as mutual aid and cooperation networks or mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings, using old cooperatives to lead new cooperatives, focusing on demonstrations, visiting and discussing, exchanging experiences, and promoting the progress of new cooperatives. County and district cadres regularly inspect and solve problems. For the third category of cooperatives with more problems, personnel are sent to the cooperatives to help strive for consolidation. According to the experience of North China in rectifying agricultural production cooperatives during this period: newly established cooperatives have more problems, and they cannot be consolidated by one inspection. At present, various localities are still continuing to consolidate the newly established cooperatives in conjunction with production.

### 华北区新建的农业生产合作社逐渐巩固

    华北区新建的农业生产合作社逐渐巩固
    【本报讯】华北区今年新建成的三万六千一百多个农业生产合作社，绝大部分得到巩固，老社也有不同程度的扩大。现在全区共有新老农业生产合作社四万一千八百多个。入社农户占华北区农户总数百分之六点九。全区五十户到百户的大社有一千四百多个，百户以上的大社有三百多个。建社过程中各地互助组也有很大发展，据山西省长治专区高平等八县统计：去年秋季参加互助组的农户共十四万多户，今年除部分互助组转为农业生产合作社外，参加互助组的农户增为十九万多户，增加百分之三十五左右。现在全区组织起来的农户平均已由去年的百分之五十增加到百分之六十左右，先进地区已发展到百分之八九十。
    华北区原计划今年春耕前建立新社一万七千多个，由于总路线宣传的深入，农民社会主义觉悟普遍提高，加以老社在生产上所表现的优越性对农民的吸引，各地建社计划大大超过。为保证互助合作运动的健康发展，中共中央华北局曾于二月份专门召开会议，检查建社情况，提出停止发展转向巩固的方针。会后各地立即把领导力量转到巩固方面来，对新建社普遍进行检查整顿。据山西、河北两省整顿的情况看来，新建社有百分之四十到五十是完全巩固的；约百分之四十的社虽有些问题，但基本上是巩固的；只有约百分之十以下的社问题较多，其中有些条件不具备的已转为互助组。山西省今年新建的七千多个社中，经过整顿绝大部分都巩固下来，只有二十三个转为互助组。河北省据八千多个社的统计，只有一百七十二个社因条件不具备转为互助组，占百分之二强。这些情况证明今年华北区社的发展基本上是良好的、健康的。
    各地对新社的整顿检查工作，一般都从组织生产着手，结合春耕首先制订或修订生产计划，安排生产、开辟增产门路，使社员感到入社后有了奔头。河北省定县专区一千零一个社在未整顿前有百分之六十一没有计划或只有笼统计划而无具体措施，整顿后有百分之九十以上的社制订或修订了计划，使新建社在生产中巩固下来。其次是普遍进行了组织整顿，把混进社的地主、富农、反革命分子清洗出去。建立了切实可行的劳力组织和财务管理等制度。各地都吸收老社经验推行包工制，据山西省五千六百多个社的统计，试行包工包产的有四百多社，常年包工的有二千三百多社，临时包工的有二千一百多社，临时派工的只有七百多社。在整顿过程中，各地一般都注意结合政治思想教育，不断提高社员觉悟，合理解决中贫农间、新老社员间的团结问题，解决社的土地劳力分益比例问题，解除社员的思想顾虑。
    适应农业生产合作社的大量发展和干部缺乏经验的新情况，各地在整顿中对新建社普遍进行了分类排队，对一、二类问题较少的社，多采用互助合作网或互助合作代表会等形式，以老社带新社的办法，重点示范，参观座谈，交流经验，推动新社前进，县区干部定期检查解决问题。对第三类问题较多的社，则派人驻社帮助争取巩固。据华北区这段整顿农业生产合作社的经验：新建社问题较多，不是检查一次就能巩固下来的，现在各地仍在结合生产继续进行新建社的巩固工作。
