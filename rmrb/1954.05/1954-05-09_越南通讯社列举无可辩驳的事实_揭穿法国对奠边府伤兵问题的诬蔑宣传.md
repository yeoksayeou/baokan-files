Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 7th: French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault recently raised the issue of wounded soldiers at Dien Bien Phu in a private meeting in Geneva. He shamelessly fabricated some unfounded claims, insisting that the command of the Vietnamese People's Army had "requested a ceasefire" on March 15th, and that de Castries had "agreed" to the ceasefire. Bidault also falsely accused the Vietnamese People's Army of "firing on French aircraft sent to Dien Bien Phu to evacuate the wounded."

But the actual situation was: After the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated a large number of enemy troops around Dien Bien Phu's strongholds on March 13th and 14th, President Ho Chi Minh, out of humanitarian considerations, ordered the Vietnamese People's Army to release 78 wounded enemy prisoners of war. Subsequently, the Vietnamese People's Army allowed the enemy to transport the wounded soldiers from Independent Hill. On March 17th, French Captain Timonier even wrote a letter to the Vietnamese People's Army to express his gratitude. However, the French colonialists have tried every means to distort the facts in order to cover up their defeat.

On the other hand, the French colonialists did not comply with international rules. From March 15th to 19th, the enemy command sent US-made bombers to strafe and drop large numbers of bombs and napalm bombs on the Vietnamese People's Army's wounded soldier hospitals, knowing the locations of these hospitals. Since March 15th, the French command has used Dakota transport planes, painted with "Red Cross" markings, to transport large quantities of 105mm howitzer and 120mm mortar shells to Dien Bien Phu.

The facts are clear. However, the French colonialists deliberately distort the facts and continue to distort the facts in order to deceive French and world public opinion.

However, the imperialists' slanders cannot deceive the people. The lenient and humanitarian policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards wounded enemy prisoners of war has been proven many times. For example, after the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in the offensive in the northern border area in 1950, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam allowed enemy aircraft to land at the That Khe airfield to transport wounded French prisoners of war to Hanoi. Similarly, after the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in the offensive in the midstream of the Red River in North Vietnam in 1951, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam allowed enemy aircraft to land at the Thai Nguyen airfield to transport French wounded soldiers back. In several other victorious battles, the Vietnamese People's Army carefully bandaged the wounds of the wounded enemy prisoners of war before releasing them on the spot. The Vietnamese People's Army Command, under the orders of President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has released thousands of prisoners of war.

Conversely, the enemy treats Vietnamese wounded in an extremely inhumane manner. After invading a village during a "mopping-up" operation, the French command ordered French troops to find the wounded and shoot them in the head.

The French colonialists shamelessly talk about "the rules of war and humanitarianism." But the Vietnamese people will never forget the endless suffering and disaster they have suffered in the war of aggression launched by the French colonialists. They will never forget the inhuman tortures and massacres suffered by thousands of innocent Vietnamese people. Not long ago, on April 10, 1954, the enemy used US-made aircraft to bomb and strafe two thousand people concentrated in Long Nhai village, Dien Bien Phu, killing and wounding 650 people.

The above facts have completely exposed the slanderous and distorted propaganda carried out by the imperialists on the issue of wounded prisoners of war in Dien Bien Phu.

### 越南通讯社列举无可辩驳的事实  揭穿法国对奠边府伤兵问题的诬蔑宣传

    越南通讯社列举无可辩驳的事实
    揭穿法国对奠边府伤兵问题的诬蔑宣传
    【新华社八日讯】越南通讯社七日报道：法国外交部部长皮杜尔最近在日内瓦的私人晤谈中提出了奠边府伤兵的问题。他无耻地捏造了一些莫须有的事情，硬说越南人民军司令部方面在三月十五日曾经“要求休战”，并说德卡斯特莱曾经“答应”休战。皮杜尔并诬蔑说，越南人民军曾向“派到奠边府撤出伤兵的法国飞机开火”。
  但是实际情况是：在越南人民军在三月十三日和十四日在奠边府周围据点歼灭大批敌军后，胡志明主席出于人道的考虑，命令越南人民军释放了七十八名受伤的敌军战俘，其后，越南人民军方面就让敌人来运走独立山上的伤兵。三月十七日，法军蒂莫尼尔上尉还写了一封信向越南人民军方面表示感谢。但是，法国殖民者为了掩饰他们的失败却千方百计地歪曲事实。
    另一方面，法国殖民者没有遵守国际规则。从三月十五日到十九日，敌军司令部派美制轰炸机来扫射并向越南人民军的伤兵医院投掷了大量的炸弹和凝固汽油弹，他们知道这些医院的地点。自从三月十五日以后，法军司令部用涂有“红十字”标记的达科他式运输机向奠边府运输大量的一零五公厘口径大炮和一二零公厘口径迫击炮的炮弹。
    事实是明显不过的。但是法国殖民者蓄意歪曲事实并仍在继续歪曲事实，以便欺骗法国和世界舆论。
    然而帝国主义者的诬蔑是欺骗不了人民的。越南民主共和国政府对于受伤的敌军战俘所采取的宽大和人道主义的政策，已经得到多次的证明。例如，在一九五○年，越南人民军在北部边境地区的攻势胜利以后，越南民主共和国政府曾让敌军飞机在七溪机场降落，把受伤的法军战俘运往河内。又如在一九五一年，越南人民军在北越红河中游地区的攻势胜利以后，越南民主共和国政府曾让敌军飞机在太原机场降落，把法国伤兵运回去。在好几次其他的胜利战役里，越南人民军小心地为受伤敌军战俘裹好伤口以后，就把他们就地释放。越南人民军司令部根据胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的命令，已释放几千名战俘。
    相反地，敌军对待越南的伤员极不人道。他们在“扫荡”战中侵入某一村庄以后，法军司令部就命令法军找出受伤的人，并用枪口对准头部把他们打死。
    法国殖民者竟然无耻地讲什么“战争的规则与人道主义”。但是越南人民永远不会忘记他们在法国殖民者发动的侵略战争里所受的无穷痛苦与灾难。他们永远不会忘记成千无辜的越南人民所受的惨无人道的酷刑和被大批屠杀的情形。不久以前，在一九五四年四月十日，敌人用美制的飞机轰炸和扫射被他们集中在奠边府龙涯村的两千个人民，杀死和打伤六百五十人。
    上述的事实已经完全揭穿了帝国主义者在奠边府受伤战俘问题上所进行的诬蔑与歪曲的宣传。
