    Ningxia Province Mongolian Autonomous Region Jilantai Pool Salt to be Exported in Large Quantities
    The Ningxia Province Mongolian Autonomous Region will organize more than 20,000 camels to participate in transportation at the Jilantai Salt Pool, in order to supply a large amount of crystalline table salt to the people of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shaanxi Province. The Jilantai Salt Pool is located in the northeast of Alxa Banner and is one of the largest salt pools in the Autonomous Region. The salt reserves are estimated to be enough for 500 million people in China to consume for ten years, and the salt quality contains 98% sodium chloride. The Autonomous Region has already organized Mongolian people's camels to transport 170,000 dan of table salt last winter and this spring, and another 200,000 dan will be transported out in May this year. Currently, nearly a thousand camels are participating in the salt transportation. After the salt transportation task is completed, the Mongolian transporters will be able to earn 3.5 billion yuan in transportation fees.
    In order to do a good job in this camel salt transportation work, the Ningxia Province Salt Affairs Administration has prepared 250,000 salt bags, and together with the Provincial Grain Company, has prepared more than one million jin of grain and a large number of cloth and tea to supply the Mongolian carriers. The Alxa Banner of the Autonomous Region, in order to assist the Mongolian people in doing a good job in the salt transportation work, held two Sumuda (equivalent to district head) and Bagda (equivalent to township head) symposiums to discuss various transportation matters.

    宁夏省蒙古自治区吉兰泰池盐将大量外销
    宁夏省蒙古自治区将组织两万多峰骆驼，到吉兰泰盐池参加驮运，以大量结晶体食盐供应内蒙古自治区和陕西等地人民食用。吉兰泰盐池位于阿拉善旗东北部，是自治区内最大的盐池之一，盐的蕴藏量约可供我国五亿人口食用十年，盐质含氯化钠达百分之九十八。自治区在去冬今春已组织蒙民的骆驼运出食盐十七万担，今年五月份还要运出二十万担。目前已有近千峰骆驼参加运盐，运盐任务完成后，运盐蒙民将可收入运费三十五亿元。
    为了作好这次骆驼运盐工作，宁夏省盐务管理局已准备好装盐布袋二十五万条，并和省粮食公司共同准备一百多万斤粮食和大批布匹、茶叶供应蒙族驮户。自治区阿拉善旗为了协助蒙民做好运盐工作，曾召开了两次苏木达（相当区长）、巴格达（相当乡长）座谈会，讨论各项运输事宜。
