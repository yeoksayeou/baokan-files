The Central People's Government Administration Council’s order on implementing planned purchase and supply of grain stipulates: “Farmers' surplus grain after paying agricultural tax and meeting planned purchase quotas can be freely stored and used, continued to be sold to state grain departments or cooperatives, or traded in state-established grain markets, and small amounts of inter-rural exchanges are permitted.”

The transactions in the state-established grain markets mentioned here are different from the current planned supply based on vouchers, and also different from the free grain transactions with private merchants participating before the unified purchase and sale of grain, which were highly blind. This is a grain market managed by the state without the participation of private merchants, a place for producers and consumers in rural areas, sellers and those in need, to directly adjust supply and demand and exchange information through exchange. Here, farmers can sell their surplus grain beyond what is sold to the state according to government decrees, and grain-deficient households in rural areas and some sideline producers who use grain as raw materials can buy the grain and raw materials they need. Doing this work well can further adjust the supply and demand of grain in rural areas. It can both cooperate with the state's planned grain supply to ensure the grain needs of rural residents and reduce the burden of state sales. This is an important link to ensure the success of rural grain supply.

Now the national unified grain purchase work has been successfully concluded, and the state has mastered a sufficient amount of commercial grain. In the future, the state has sufficient guarantees to stabilize grain prices and supply the basic needs of urban people and grain-deficient households in rural areas. Why should we organize rural primary grain markets and allow farmers to conduct small amounts of grain transactions? This is because the state's planned grain purchase only purchases a portion of farmers' grain based on the state's needs and the general level of farmers' commercial grain sales, to ensure that the state has a firm grasp of the grain market and meets the needs of urban people and rural people who lack grain. The state has not purchased all of the farmers' commercial grain. Some farmers still have surplus grain after the state's planned purchase and require continued sales; and some farmers, although they do not have surplus grain, want to find opportunities for revolving sales. For example, some farmers sell their food grain in order to engage in a certain sideline, and need to buy it back after a period of time; most farmers also inevitably have the need to exchange varieties with each other in order to better arrange production and life, exchanging more for less and having for none. However, the grain planned to be purchased by the state is only the main and large quantities of some varieties, and planned supply cannot fully meet the diverse needs of farmers. This situation will exist not only in the initial stage of planned purchase and supply, but also for a long time to come.

Some comrades believe that since planned purchase and sales are implemented, the state should be responsible for all purchases and sales, and the state should take care of everything. This idea is naive and contains errors. They do not understand the current situation of the rural economy, the main purpose of the state's implementation of planned purchase and sales, and the fact that the state's current planned purchase and sales can only suppress capitalist commercial speculation, but cannot completely eliminate commodity exchange with small private owners. At present, the majority of rural residents in the country are small private owners, living a decentralized life, and it is impossible to deal with their consumption problems in the same way as dealing with factory workers. Even when collective ownership replaces small private ownership, and farmers' production and sales are basically included in the state's planned track, the state and cooperative farms must maintain commodity exchange relations for a long time, and commodity exchange between farms and between farmers cannot be easily cancelled under certain conditions.

Some comrades only see the temporary difficulties of some grain-deficient households and believe that although it is feasible in principle to establish a state-managed rural primary grain market, they doubt whether this market can really play a role in grain regulation. This view is also one-sided. They lack understanding of the fact that the vast majority of farmers still have surplus grain and underestimate the basic requirements of farmers to mutually regulate grain. They do not know that as long as a primary grain market is established in rural areas, and our work is done correctly, it will facilitate the transactions of surplus grain households and solve the difficulties of grain-deficient households. If we do not earnestly carry out this organizational work, and adopt a negative attitude towards the role of the primary grain market from the beginning, it is obviously wrong. Conversely, if we advocate restoring a blind and free grain trading market, it will definitely mess things up.

Some people also believe that setting up a primary market is equivalent to letting the spontaneous trends in rural areas go unchecked, which is not in line with the requirements of planned purchase and sales, so they also disagree with promoting it. They do not understand that since farmers' exchange of grain seeds and mutual exchange of needs are normal, if they are not led and allowed to flow freely, it will inevitably cause speculators to take advantage of the situation. If they are led and carried out in an organized manner, they can not only meet the needs of farmers, but also prevent the activities of speculative forces.

It can be seen from this that while implementing planned purchase and supply of grain, it is also necessary to establish a rural primary grain market to revitalize the rural economy, alleviate the contradiction between the planned purchase and supply policy of grain and the blindness of the small-scale peasant economy, and give fuller play to the positive role of the planned grain purchase policy in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, completely eliminate the speculative activities of private grain merchants and the black market for grain, further stabilize grain prices, ensure supply in urban and rural areas, and provide opportunities for the further development of agricultural production and the processing of some agricultural products, household sidelines, etc., so as to better ensure the supply of non-staple foods in urban and rural areas and increase farmers' income.

In January 1954, Handan Special District of Hebei Province established 72 rural primary grain markets. The sales volume of grain in each market ranged from 1,000 jin to 3,000 jin, with the highest reaching 7,000 jin. The grain price maintained a balance with the state price, and the masses were extremely satisfied. In addition, there are many good examples in Henan and Shanxi. This fully shows that the primary grain market established by the state is not only very necessary, but also very effective. Comrades in various places must pay attention to their experience and conscientiously and quickly organize rural primary grain markets, and must not ignore or delay any longer.

According to existing experience, when organizing rural primary grain markets, the following should be noted:

First, the location of the market should be arranged by the people's governments at all levels, especially the county and district people's governments, according to the needs and habits of the people. This market should generally be established in appropriate townships, towns, or in the original market towns. The quantity should not be too many, as it will be difficult to manage; nor should it be too few, as it will be inconvenient for the people. The management of the market can be entrusted to the government's industrial and commercial departments, grain departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives to be responsible for their respective tasks. In order to do this work well, it is necessary to select and train a group of loyal and reliable traders to undertake the necessary registration, introduction, scale management, and other affairs, and be responsible for publicizing the state's grain policy. Within a township, the state can also entrust the supply and marketing cooperative to be responsible for organizing farmers' grain regulation.

Second, in order to restrict private merchants from taking the opportunity to act and ensure the convenience of farmers' mutual regulation, the local government should stipulate some transaction methods and systems, such as appropriate transaction limits (the purchase of grain should not be restricted too strictly, and the amount of grain sold should not be restricted at all), transaction fees, grain purchase certificates, and letters of introduction. Local township governments should register certain non-grain-deficient households who require revolving sales and allow them to buy grain when needed, and should not arbitrarily restrict them. Flour mills, tofu workshops, and others who need to buy grain can also be introduced by the district and township governments to the market to purchase.

Third, in terms of price policy, the general grain varieties should generally maintain a balance with the state price, but it is reasonable to allow certain special grain varieties to be slightly higher than the state price. Within a certain limit, the price can also be freely negotiated between buyers and sellers. This will not only facilitate the farmers' mutual regulation, making farmers who have special grain varieties happy to sell, but also not affect the state's overall grain price policy. However, those who intentionally hoard and raise grain prices should be persuaded and stopped.

Fourth, explain to the farmers that after the state completes the planned purchase of grain, farmers can sell or buy grain to cooperatives or state-organized grain markets. It is glorious for farmers with surplus grain to sell grain to the state, and the state also encourages adjusting surpluses and deficiencies in the state market. For grain-deficient households, it should be explained that the purpose of fixed-quantity purchases with vouchers is to ensure the grain supply for the majority of grain-deficient households. The state is responsible for supplying their needs at any time.

Various localities should correctly apply these experiences to establish primary grain markets. We hope that this work can be done well in the next two years, this year and next year, so that it becomes a system that cooperates with the state's planned purchase and supply of grain, so that the rural economy becomes more active and the enthusiasm of the masses for production is rapidly improved.

### 认真组织国家领导的农村初级粮食市场

    认真组织国家领导的农村初级粮食市场
    中央人民政府政务院关于实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应的命令中规定：“农民在缴纳公粮和计划收购以外的余粮，可以自由存储和自由使用，可以继续售给国家粮食部门或合作社，或在国家设立的粮食市场进行交易，并可在农村间进行少量的互通有无的交易。”
    这里所指的在国家设立的粮食市场上的交易，既不同于目前实施的凭证计划供应，又不同于粮食统购统销以前有私商参加的盲目性很大的粮食自由交易，它是一种由国家管理的没有私商参加的调剂农村商品粮食流通的粮食市场，是乡村生产者和消费者之间、出卖者和需要者之间通过交换方式直接调剂供求、互通有无的交易场所。在这里，农民可以按照政府法令出售其缴售给国家以外的余粮，农村缺粮户和某些以粮食做原料的副业生产者可以买进他们所需要的粮食和原料。做好了这项工作，就可以进一步调剂农村粮食供求。它既能配合国家的粮食计划供应，保证乡村居民粮食需要；又能减轻国家销售的负担。这是保证做好农村粮食供应的一个重要环节。
    现在全国粮食统购工作已经胜利结束，国家已经掌握了足够数量的商品粮食，今后国家在稳定粮食价格和供应城市人民和农村缺粮户的基本需要方面是有充分保证的，为什么还要组织农村粮食初级市场和允许农民进行少量的粮食交易呢？这是因为国家的粮食计划收购，只是根据国家的需要和农民商品粮一般出售水平收购了农民的一部分粮食，以保证国家有把握地控制粮食市场，满足城市人民和乡村缺粮人民的需要。国家并没有把农民的商品粮全部收购，还有一部分农民经过国家计划收购以后仍有余粮，要求继续出售；也还有些农民虽没有余粮，但要求找机会进行周转性的出售。例如，有的农民为了经营某种副业，把食用粮卖出了，过一个时期又需要买进来；大部分农民为了把生产和生活安排得更好，相互之间进行品种的交换，以多易少、以有换无的要求也是不可避免的。但国家计划收购的粮食只是主要的大量的一些品种，计划供应也不可能完全满足农民多方面的需要。这种情况，不但在计划收购与计划供应的初期是会存在的，就在将来一个长时期内也会存在的。
    有些同志认为，既然实行计划购销，就应当由国家包购包销，一切由国家包下来。这种想法是天真的也是包含着错误的。他们不了解农村经济的现状，不了解国家实行计划购销的主要目的，也不了解国家现时的计划购销只能压制资本主义商业投机，而不可能完全排除与小私有者之间的商品交换。目前全国农村居民大多数是小私有者，他们过着分散的生活，如像对待工厂工人一样处理他们的消费问题，是不可能的。即便在集体所有制代替小私有制、农民生产和供销基本上纳入国家计划轨道的时候，国家和合作农庄之间还必须维持很长时间的商品交换关系，而农庄之间、农民之间的商品交换在一定条件下是不能轻易取消的。
    有一些同志只看到某些缺粮户一时的困难，就认为建立由国家管理的农村初级粮食市场虽然原则上可行，但对这种市场是不是真能起到粮食调剂的作用，却表示怀疑。这种看法也是片面的。他们对广大农民仍有余粮这一事实缺乏了解，对农民需要互相调剂粮食的基本要求也估计不足。他们不知道，只要建立起农村的初级粮食市场来，而我们的工作又做得正确，就能便利于余粮户进行交易，解决缺粮户的困难。如果我们不切实地去进行这项组织工作，而对举办初级粮食市场的作用一开始就采取否定态度，那显然是错误的。反过来，如果主张恢复盲目的自由的粮食交易市场，那就一定会把事情弄糟。
    还有些人认为设置了初级市场，就等于放任农村自发趋势，不适合计划购销的要求，因此也不同意加以提倡。他们不懂得，农民交换粮种和互通有无既然是正常的需要，如果不加领导，任其自流，必然会引起投机商人的乘隙活动，而如果加以领导，使它有组织地进行，就不但能够满足农民的需要，而且可以防止投机势力的活动。
    由此可见，在实行粮食计划收购和计划供应的同时，还必须建立农村初级粮食市场，以便活跃乡村经济，减轻粮食计划收购和计划供应政策与小农经济盲目性之间的矛盾，更充分地发挥粮食计划收购政策对农业社会主义改造的积极推动作用，彻底消灭私营粮商的投机活动和粮食黑市，进一步稳定粮价，保证城乡供给，使农业生产和某些农产品的加工业、家庭副业等生产得到进一步发展的机会，更好地保证城乡副食品的供应，增加农民收入。
    河北省邯郸专区在一九五四年一月份建立了七十二个农村初级粮食市场，每个市场上粮食的出售量由一千斤到三千斤，最多的达七千斤，粮食价格保持了和国家牌价相平衡，群众极为满意。此外河南山西也有很多好例子。这充分说明，国家建立的初级粮食市场，不但是很有必要的，而且是很有作用的。各地同志必须注意他们的经验，认真地迅速地组织农村初级粮食市场，再不可忽视和延误了。
    根据已有的经验，组织农村初级粮食市场的时候，应该注意：
    第一，市场的设立位置，应由各级人民政府特别是县区人民政府按照人民需要和习惯加以安排。这种市场一般要选择适当的乡、镇或在原来的集镇上建立。数量不要太多，多了不容易管理；也不要太少，少了人民不方便。市场的管理，可以委托政府工商部门、粮食部门和供销合作社分工负责。为了作好这一工作，必须选择和训练一批忠实可靠的交易员去担任必要的登记，介绍，司斗、司秤等事务，并负责宣传国家粮食政策。在一个乡内还可以由国家委托供销合作社负责组织农民的粮食调剂。
    第二，为了限制私商乘机活动，保证农民之间有无调剂的方便，当地政府应规定一些交易办法和制度，如适当的交易限额、（购粮不要限制过严，售粮多少则根本不限制）交易手续费、购粮证件和介绍信等，各地乡政府对于某些非缺粮户要求周转性的售粮应予以登记，允许他们在需要时候买进粮食，不可任意加以限制。粉坊豆腐坊等需要购粮也可以由区乡政府介绍到市场购买。
    第三，在价格政策上，一般粮种应大体保持与国家牌价相平衡，但某些特殊粮种稍高于国家牌价是应当允许的，这是合理的。在一定限度内也可以由买卖双方自由议价。这样既便利于农民之间的有无调剂，使保有特殊粮种的农民乐于出售，又不致影响国家整个粮食价格政策。但对于有意居奇、抬高粮价的则应予以说服制止。
    第四，向农民说明在国家完成粮食计划收购以后，农民可以向合作社或国家组织的粮食市场售粮或购粮，有余粮的农户把粮食卖给国家是光荣的，在国家市场上调剂有无也是国家所鼓励的。对缺粮户要说明凭证定量购买是为了保证对大多数缺粮户的粮食供应。对于他们的需要，在任何时候，国家都负责供给的。
    各地应该正确地运用这些经验，去建立初级粮食市场。我们希望这个工作能在今年和明年两年内做好，使它成为一种制度，配合国家粮食计划收购和计划供应工作，使农村经济更趋活跃，群众生产积极性迅速提高起来。
