The 3,580,000 mu of winter wheat in Xinjiang Province have all turned green. Generally, the growth is robust and vigorous. Farmers of all ethnic groups are actively carrying out management work such as topdressing fertilizer, spring harrowing, watering, and weeding to ensure a bumper harvest. With the exception of a few low-lying or shady areas, the winter wheat in all parts of the province generally has no missing seedlings and is growing strongly and vigorously. As the spring breeze passes, it has already become a sea of wheat.

Although there was generally more snow and rain last winter and this spring, and the weather turned warmer later, with continuous spring snow in southern Xinjiang at the end of February and beginning of March, and cold air invading northern Xinjiang in early April with snow and rain, and temperatures dropping to minus ten degrees Celsius, basically no damage from freezing occurred because farmers of all ethnic groups have accumulated some experience in cultivating winter wheat in recent years, and cultivation management techniques have been improved.

In the spring thawing and greening season this year, all areas have promptly carried out a series of management tasks such as spreading ash, applying soil, harrowing, and watering appropriately. Farmers in Yutian, Minfeng, Shache and other counties have started weeding early in order to prevent weeds from absorbing the nutrients and water of the wheat seedlings. Most of the winter wheat in southern Xinjiang has been watered for the first time. Farmers in Yecheng, Yingjisha, Kuche and other counties are also using various methods such as irrigation and trapping to eliminate underground pests; at the same time, they are using spreading wood ash and self-made lime sulfur mixture to prevent yellow rust disease in winter wheat.

    新疆省冬麦生长旺盛
    新疆省三百五十八万余亩冬小麦，现已全部返青。一般生长茁壮旺盛，各族农民为保证丰收，正积极进行追施肥料、春耙、浇水和除草等管理工作。全省各地冬麦除个别低洼或山阴地区外，基本上都不缺苗，生长健壮旺盛。春风过处已成麦浪。
    去冬今春虽普遍雪雨较多，气候转暖较迟，南疆二月底三月初并连降春雪，北疆四月上旬有寒潮侵袭并降雪雨，气温降至零下十度。但因近年来各族农民栽培冬麦已积累了一些经验，耕作管理技术有了改进，所以基本上未遭冻害。
    各地在今春解冻返青季节，都及时进行了撒灰、上土、耙耱、适量浇水等一系列的管理工作。于阗、民丰、莎车等县农民为了不让杂草吸收麦苗的养分和水分，提早了拔草工作。南疆大部分冬麦已浇了头遍水。叶城、英吉沙、库车等县农民并采用灌水、诱杀等各种办法扑灭地下害虫；同时用撒草木灰和自制石硫合剂来防治冬麦的黄锈病。
