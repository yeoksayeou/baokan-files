Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang dispatch: Korean newspapers warmly support the plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue proposed by Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the Geneva Conference.

    "Rodong Sinmun" and "Minju Choson" published editorials on the 29th, unanimously supporting the plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue proposed by Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the Geneva Conference.

      "Rodong Sinmun," in its editorial titled "Our Just Claim for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea," stated: The just plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects the unified will of the Korean people to peacefully reunify. The editorial pointed out: The Korean people have consistently struggled for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland from the time of liberation to the present. The realization of the Korean armistice opened the way for the peaceful reunification of Korea on democratic principles, but the U.S. side has obstructed it. Subsequently, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the Geneva Conference was decided upon at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to promote the resolution of the Korean issue. All these facts show that the conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue have matured under the concerted efforts of the countries concerned. And the participation of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Geneva Conference is conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The editorial pointed out: In accordance with the wishes of the Korean people and all peace-loving people, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a just plan to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. However, the representative of the South Korean regime, following the United States, repeated hackneyed slanders against the democratic forces of the Korean people and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in his speech, opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, and did not put forward any proposal for unifying Korea on a democratic basis.

    The editorial finally emphasized that the plan put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out the correct path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and is a fair and reasonable plan that can be accepted. It will be warmly supported by all the people of both North and South Korea and peace-loving people all over the world. The editorial in "Minju Choson" pointed out that the plan proposed by Foreign Minister Nam Il outlined appropriate and necessary measures to achieve the national unification of Korea. One of the main tasks of the All-Korea Committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea is to eliminate foreign interference and pressure from local authorities and terrorist groups, and to guarantee the freedom of residents so that democratic elections can be held in a free atmosphere. At the same time, measures to seek economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea are undoubtedly a heavy blow to the plot to permanently divide Korea, but are favorable conditions for promoting and realizing Korean national unification. In addition, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a consistent demand of the Korean people and a necessary condition for the Korean people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue themselves. The editorial emphasized that the plan put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again demonstrated to the world the consistent efforts of the Republic government to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. All the Korean people warmly support this plan and are determined to work hard to achieve positive results at the Geneva Conference, to transform the Korean armistice into permanent peace and to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    The "Korean Minbo," the organ of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Party, published an editorial on April 30, expressing warm support for the plan of Foreign Minister Nam Il. The editorial said: The Geneva Conference should adopt a resolution based on this plan so that the Korean armistice can be turned into a solid peace and promote the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea on democratic principles.

    朝鲜舆论拥护南日关于解决朝鲜问题方案
    据新华社平壤电：朝鲜报纸热烈拥护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在日内瓦会议上提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的方案。
    “劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”二十九日发表社论，一致支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在日内瓦会议上所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的方案。
      “劳动新闻”在题为“我们对于和平统一朝鲜的正当主张”的社论中说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的正当方案，反映了朝鲜人民希望和平统一的一致意志。社论指出：朝鲜人民从解放到现在，一贯地为和平统一祖国而进行斗争。朝鲜停战的实现，打开了在民主的原则上和平统一朝鲜的道路，然而美方却加以阻挠。其后由于苏联的努力，在柏林四国外长会议上决定召开日内瓦会议来促进朝鲜问题的解决。这一切事实表明，在有关国家的一致努力下，和平解决朝鲜问题的条件已经成熟了。而朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的参加日内瓦会议，是有利于和平解决朝鲜问题的。社论指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团按照朝鲜人民和全体爱好和平的人民的愿望，已提出了为防止朝鲜战争再起与和平解决朝鲜问题的正当方案。然而，追随美国的南朝鲜政权的代表在发言中却重弹滥调，对朝鲜人民的民主力量和苏联、中华人民共和国反复地进行诬蔑，反对从朝鲜撤出美国军队，而且没有提出在民主基础上统一朝鲜的任何建议。
    社论最后强调指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出的方案指出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正当道路，是可以被接受的公平合理的方案。它将受到南北朝鲜全体人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈支持。“民主朝鲜报”的社论指出：南日外务相提出的方案规划了为达成朝鲜的国家统一的适当而必要的各种措施。南北朝鲜代表组成的全朝鲜委员会的主要任务之一就是要排除外国干涉及地方政权当局和恐怖集团的压力，保障居民的自由，以便在自由的气氛中举行民主选举。同时，谋求南北朝鲜之间经济及文化交流的措施，毫无疑问地对于永久分裂朝鲜的阴谋是一个沉重的打击，但却是促成和实现朝鲜国家统一的有利条件。此外，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队也是朝鲜人民的一贯要求，这是由朝鲜人民自己来和平解决朝鲜问题的必要条件。社论着重指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出的方案，再一次向全世界表明了共和国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯努力。全体朝鲜人民热烈支持这个方案，并决心为日内瓦会议能得出肯定的结果而努力，使朝鲜的停战转入永久的和平并实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    北朝鲜民主党中央委员会机关报“朝鲜民报”四月三十日发表社论，表示热烈拥护和支持南日外务相的方案，社论说：日内瓦会议应根据这个方案通过决定，以便使朝鲜停战转向巩固的和平，并促进在民主原则上实现朝鲜的和平统一。
