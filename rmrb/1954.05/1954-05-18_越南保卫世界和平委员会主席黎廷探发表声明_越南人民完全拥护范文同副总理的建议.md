Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: Vietnam News Agency reports: Lê Đình Thám, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, issued a statement regarding the Geneva Conference. The full text is as follows:

    The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, like the people of the world, are peace-loving. Due to the French colonialists' invasion of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and the increasingly intensified assistance of American interventionists to the French colonialists in carrying out aggression and directly interfering in the Indochina War, the people of Vietnam and the people of Cambodia and Laos have been engaged in a heroic struggle to win the right to live in peace and national independence.

    Since the outbreak of the Indochina War, the people of Vietnam and the people of Cambodia and Laos have continuously demanded a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. Therefore, the people of Vietnam and the people of Cambodia and Laos warmly welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    The speeches by Foreign Ministers Phạm Văn Đồng, Nam Il, Molotov, and Zhou Enlai at the Geneva Conference not only conform to the peaceful aspirations of the people of Indochina and Korea but also conform to the peaceful aspirations of the people of Asia and the world. The peace-loving Vietnamese people fully support their speeches.

    The speech by Phạm Văn Đồng, chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the Geneva Conference on May 10, 1954, clearly stated the position of the Vietnamese people: peace, independence, unity, and democracy. This position is also the position of the resisting people of Cambodia and Laos.

    Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng also specifically put forward eight proposals for restoring peace in Indochina. These proposals are in line with the actual situation and peaceful aspirations of the people of Indochina and the people of France, and are in line with the common主張 of the world peace movement. This speech should become the basis for discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    Phạm Văn Đồng also suggested inviting representatives of the Cambodian and Laotian resistance governments to participate in the Geneva Conference to discuss the Indochina issue. This suggestion is also justified. The Cambodian and Laotian resistance governments have led the people of Cambodia and Laos in eight years of heroic resistance and have achieved great victories in military, political, economic, and cultural fields. If the Indochina issue is to be resolved peacefully, without the participation of representatives of the Cambodian and Laotian resistance governments, it cannot be resolved rationally.

    Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng's attitude at the Geneva Conference is sincere, and he is working hard to restore peace in Indochina and help the Geneva Conference succeed. I firmly believe that the people of Vietnam and the people of Cambodia and Laos, as well as the people of France, will firmly support Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng's proposals and, together with the people of Asia and the world, oppose any conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference and any conspiracy to continue and expand the Indochina War.

    越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探发表声明
    越南人民完全拥护范文同副总理的建议
    【新华社十七日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探发表关于日内瓦会议的
    声明。全文如下：
    越南、高棉、寮国三国人民和世界人民一样，都是热爱和平的。由于法国殖民者侵略越南、高棉和寮国，由于美国干涉者日益加紧地帮助法国殖民者进行侵略并直接干涉印度支那战争，越南人民和高棉、寮国两国人民为了争取过和平生活的权利和民族独立，才进行了英勇的斗争。
    从印度支那战争爆发以来，越南人民和高棉、寮国两国人民就不断地要求和平解决印度支那问题。因此，越南人民和高棉、寮国两国人民热烈地欢迎为和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦会议的召开。
    范文同、南日、莫洛托夫和周恩来等外长在日内瓦会议上的发言，不仅符合于印度支那和朝鲜人民的和平愿望，同时也符合于亚洲人民和全世界人民的和平愿望。爱好和平的越南人民完全拥护他们
   的发言。
    越南民主共和国代表团首席代表、副总理兼代理外交部长范文同一九五四年五月十日在日内瓦会议上的发言，已经明确地提出了越南人民的立场：和平、独立、统一和民主。这个立场也是抗战的高棉、寮国两国人民的立场。
    范文同副总理还具体地提出了恢复印度支那和平的八项建议，这个建议是符合于印度支那人民和法国人民的实际情况与和平愿望的，是符合于世界和平运动的共同主张的。这个发言应该成为讨论恢复印度支那和平的基础。
    范文同并且建议邀请高棉和寮国两国抗战政府代表参加日内瓦会议以讨论印度支那问题。这个建议也是正当的。高棉抗战政府和寮国抗战政府，领导了高棉、寮国两国人民进行了八年来的英勇抗战，并在军事、政治、经济、文化各方面都取得了很大胜利，如果和平解决印度支那问题，而没有高棉、寮国两国抗战政府代表参加，是不能合理解决的。
    范文同副总理在日内瓦会议上的态度是诚恳的，是努力争取恢复印度支那和平的，是帮助日内瓦会议得到成功的。我深信越南人民和高棉、寮国两国人民以及法国人民将坚决支持范文同副总理的建议，并和亚洲人民和全世界人民一起，反对任何破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋，反对继续和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。
