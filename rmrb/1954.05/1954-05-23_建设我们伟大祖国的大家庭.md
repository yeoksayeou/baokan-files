    Building Our Great Motherland's Big Family
    Banchan Erde Ni
    The third anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet has arrived, and this is a joyous day for the people of the whole country and the people of Tibet. Three years ago today, Tibet returned to the big family of the motherland. From then on, the Tibetan people, like all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, have been living a happy life of equality, friendship, unity, and mutual assistance. I am delighted for this festival and congratulate it.
    In the past three years, our motherland has been like the rising sun. Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, it has become increasingly prosperous and strong. Not only has the foundation of the motherland's big family been built, but the roof has also been built. The people of the motherland have also made great contributions to defending world peace. In the three years since the peaceful liberation of the Tibet region, thanks to the deep concern of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and the brotherly assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, the relationship between the Tibetan ethnic group and the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland has become increasingly close under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism. The internal unity of the Tibetan ethnic group has also become increasingly consolidated. Tibet's political, economic, cultural, educational, and health undertakings have all been developed. These were impossible in the era of rule by successive reactionary governments and the intrusion of imperialist forces into Tibet. Now, Tibetan farmers and herdsmen have received interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans. Private businesses and handicrafts have received support from state-owned trading companies and the People's Bank. Children have the opportunity to go to school, and the sick receive free treatment. Agricultural experiment stations have been established in Lhasa and Xigaze to cultivate crops using new scientific methods. In some areas, farmers have begun to build water conservancy projects with the help of the Central People's Government. Patriotic Tibetan youths have their own learning organizations, and officials have organized learning committees to study ethnic policies and new knowledge together in order to better serve the people. The Kangzang Highway, which will bring happiness to the Tibetan people, is being built at an accelerated pace and will soon be open to traffic in Lhasa.
    In the past three years, I have personally experienced that the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet is a brave and hardworking army. They always think of the people, reclaim wasteland and build houses themselves, and strive to learn the Tibetan language, strictly abide by discipline, and follow Chairman Mao's instructions to protect temples and respect religious beliefs, which makes us particularly satisfied and happy. From today's facts, I think of Tibet's tomorrow, which proves that the great Chairman Mao, the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet care for and help the Tibetan people in every possible way. It also makes me think that only when we Tibetan people unite and work hand in hand with the fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland to jointly build the big family of the motherland, can Tibet's prosperity be possible. It also makes me think that the Dalai Lama and I bear a glorious and important responsibility in the cause of building a new Tibet. The facts of the past three years prove that the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet is completely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people. We must continue to work for its full and thorough implementation, respond to the call of the motherland, support the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, and fulfill the glorious responsibility of our Tibetan ethnic group in the cause of jointly building the great family of the motherland. I believe that we will surely be able to embark on the road to prosperity and happiness together with the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland.
    The Tibetan people must unite closely!
    Long live the big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland—the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the savior of all ethnic groups!

    建设我们伟大祖国的大家庭
    班禅额尔德尼
    关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订三周年纪念日来到了，这是全国人民和西藏人民一个大喜的日子。三年前的今天，西藏回到了祖国大家庭，从此西藏民族同全国各兄弟民族一样永远过着平等、友爱、团结互助的幸福生活，我为这个节日感到欢欣，并为它祝贺。
    三年来，我们的祖国像初升的太阳，在中国共产党、各民族人民伟大的领袖毛主席的指引下，日益繁荣昌盛，不仅祖国大家庭的房基筑好了，房顶也盖了起来，祖国人民并为保卫世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。西藏地区在和平解放后的三年中，由于毛主席和中央人民政府的深切关怀，进藏人民解放军兄弟般的帮助，在反帝爱国的旗帜下，西藏民族和祖国各兄弟民族的关系日益密切，西藏民族内部的团结也日益巩固，西藏的政治、经济、文化教育和卫生事业都得到了发展，这些都是在历代反动政府统治和帝国主义势力侵入西藏的时代里永远办不到的。现在西藏的农牧民得到了无利农牧业贷款，私营商业和手工业得到国营贸易公司和人民银行的扶助，儿童们有了入学的机会，有病的人得到免费治疗，拉萨和日喀则都成立了农业试验场，用新的科学的办法栽培作物，有些地方的农民在中央人民政府帮助下开始兴修水利。西藏的爱国青年有了自己的学习组织，官员组织了学习委员会，在一起学习民族政策和新知识，以便更好地给人民办事。将给西藏人民带来幸福的康藏公路正在加紧修筑，不久即将通车拉萨。
    三年来，我亲身体会到进藏人民解放军是一支勇敢勤劳的部队，他们处处为人民着想，自己开荒生产，修房子，还努力学习藏族语文，严守纪律，遵照毛主席的指示，保护寺庙，尊重宗教信仰，这特别使我们感到满意和高兴。从今天的事实中使我想到了西藏的明天，证明了伟大的毛主席、祖国各兄弟民族和进藏的人民解放军对西藏人民的关心和帮助是无微不至的，也使我想到只有我们西藏民族团结起来，和祖国各兄弟民族紧紧地携起手来，共同建设祖国的大家庭，西藏的繁荣才有可能，更使我想到达赖喇嘛和我在建设新西藏的事业中担负了光荣而重大的责任。三年来的事实证明，关于和平解放西藏办法的协议是完全符合西藏人民利益的，我们要继续为其全部彻底实现而努力，响应祖国的号召，支援进藏人民解放军，在共同建设伟大的祖国大家庭的事业中尽到我们西藏民族的光荣责任。我相信我们一定可以和祖国各兄弟民族人民一起走向繁荣、幸福的道路。
    西藏民族亲密地团结起来！
    祖国各族人民的大家庭——中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    各族人民的救星毛主席万岁！
