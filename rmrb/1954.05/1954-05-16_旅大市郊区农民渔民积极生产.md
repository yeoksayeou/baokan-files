The Victory Vegetable Cooperative in Daxinzhaizi Township, Lüda City's suburbs, has been supplying the city with over 10,000 jin of vegetables daily since late April, with a peak of over 16,000 jin in one day. The cooperative members have also written to the workers who visited the cooperative, expressing their desire to learn from the workers' spirit of innovation and to reform cultivation techniques. The Red Star Vegetable Cooperative cultivates more than ten varieties of vegetables. In the past, they could only plant spring melons once a year, but this year they have changed to planting three times, so that they can regularly supply the city's needs.

The apple trees, a famous specialty of the suburbs of Lüda City, are in full bloom with white flowers. The farmers are stepping up pest control and irrigation. In the mountainous orchards, some are building terraces, transforming the slopes, and conserving water and soil in the orchards. Cotton pre-sowing has reached the state requirements, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by about 6 to 9 percent compared to last year.

The fishing boats of the various fisheries production cooperatives in the suburbs of Lüda City are seizing the peak season to go out to sea to fish. The Shapaocun Fisheries Production Cooperative in Changhai County has built a new pointed-head sailboat with a load capacity of more than 20 tons and added fishing nets and lines. They went to sea twenty days earlier than last year and are now preparing to go to sea to catch large-mouth fish.

    旅大市郊大辛寨子镇胜利蔬菜合作社，今年四月下旬以来，每天向城市供应一万多斤蔬菜，最多的一天供应了一万六千多斤。社员们还写信给访问过该社的工人们，表示要学习工人的创造精神，改革耕作技术。红星蔬菜合作社栽培的蔬菜已达十多种，往年只能栽一次春瓜，今年已改为栽三次，这样就可以经常供应城市的需要。
    旅大市郊区著名特产的苹果树已经满开白花，农民们正在加紧防治虫害和进行灌溉。山地果园，有的正在修梯田，改造山坡，保持果园水土。棉花预播已达到国家要求，施肥量约比去年增加百分之六到百分之九。
    旅大市郊各渔业生产合作社的渔船正抓紧旺季出海捕鱼。长海县沙泡村渔业生产合作社，新修了一只载重二十多吨的尖头式风船，还增添了渔网渔线，今年比去年早二十天出海，现正准备出海捕大嘴鱼。　　　　（本报东北记者站）
