    Over 300,000 Senior Primary School Graduates in Shandong Participate in Agricultural Production
    In the past three years, over 300,000 rural senior primary school graduates in Shandong Province have actively participated in agricultural production, playing a significant role in various rural tasks.
    In the past three years, Shandong Province has had more than 520,000 senior primary school graduates. Among them, the vast majority of rural senior primary school graduates, except for a portion who continued their studies or took up other jobs, participated in agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from the Wendeng Special District, the district has had over 70,000 senior primary school graduates in the past three years, with about 60,000 of them in the townships. The majority of them participated in agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from the Laiyang Special District, there were over 34,000 senior primary school graduates in 1953, with over 24,400 participating in agricultural production.
    These senior primary school graduates, possessing a certain level of education and political awareness, are enthusiastic and have played a significant role on the agricultural production front. According to statistics from five counties in the Wendeng Special District, out of the 1,474 agricultural production cooperative accountants trained, 441 were senior primary school graduates. In Rongcheng County, 103 of the 198 agricultural production cooperatives had senior primary school graduates as accountants. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many rural senior primary school graduates not only mobilized their families to actively participate in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, but also enthusiastically promoted and mobilized other farmers to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Some senior primary school graduates were even elected as chairpersons of agricultural production cooperatives and leaders of mutual aid teams. After participating in production, many senior primary school graduates actively studied production techniques and agricultural science knowledge, and many have become production experts. For example, Wang Zunxian, a senior primary school graduate from Guanqiao Village, Guanqiao Township, Tenth District, Shouguang County, increased his harvest by 12% last year compared to previous years and was named a production model in the village. Han Yansong, a senior primary school graduate from Xixiaotun Village, Xintun Township, Seventh District, Gaomi County, used scientific methods to promptly cultivate, weed, control pests, and drain water for cotton, achieving a bumper harvest despite severe natural disasters.
    The vast number of rural senior primary school graduates have also played a role in other rural tasks. For example, in the unified purchase and sale of grain, many senior primary school graduates not only took the lead in mobilizing their families to sell surplus grain, but also widely promoted and mobilized surrounding farmers to sell surplus grain to the state. During the grain requisition and general elections, a large number of senior primary school graduates also enthusiastically assisted the government in carrying out the work. Senior primary school graduates have also played a significant role in enlivening rural cultural and recreational life. Many senior primary school graduates have served as Party propagandists, civil school teachers, newspaper readers, librarians, theater actors, broadcasters, and blackboard newspaper writers. According to statistics from eleven districts in Rongcheng County, 174 senior primary school graduates were hired as civil school teachers.

    山东三十余万高小毕业生参加农业生产
    山东省三年来已有三十余万农村高小毕业生积极参加了农业生产，在农村各项工作中发挥了重大作用。
    山东省三年来共有高小毕业生五十二万多人。其中农村高小毕业生除一部分升学和参加其他工作外，绝大多数参加了农业生产。据文登专区的不完整统计，全区三年来共有高小毕业生七万余名，在乡的有六万名左右。其中，绝大部分参加了农业生产。又据莱阳专区的不完整统计，一九五三年高小毕业生共三万四千多名，其中有两万四千四百余名参加了农业生产。
    这批高小毕业生，具有一定的文化水平与政治觉悟，积极热情，他们在农业生产战线上起了很大的作用。据文登专区五个县的统计，在训练的一千四百七十四名农业生产合作社会计中，就有四百四十一人是高小毕业生。荣成县一百九十八个农业生产合作社中，高小毕业生当会计的有一百零三人。在互助合作运动中，许多农村高小毕业生不仅动员自己的家属积极参加农业生产合作社和互助组，而且还热心地向农民进行宣传，动员别人参加互助合作组织。有的高小毕业生还当选了农业生产合作社的社长与互助组的组长。许多高小毕业生，参加生产后积极钻研生产技术，努力学习农业科学知识，其中并有不少人已成了生产能手。如寿光县十区官桥乡官桥村高小毕业生王尊仙，去年的收成就比往年增加了百分之十二，被评为全村的生产模范。高密县七区辛屯乡西小屯村高小毕业生韩延松，利用科学方法，及时对棉花进行修锄、除虫、排水，在遭受严重自然灾害的情况下，仍获得了丰收。
    广大农村的高小毕业生在其他各项农村工作中，也发挥了作用。如在粮食的统购统销工作中，许多高小毕业生不仅首先动员自己的家庭出卖了余粮，并且广泛进行了宣传，动员周围农民将余粮卖给国家。在征粮和普选中，大批高小毕业生也都热情地协助政府，开展工作。高小毕业生对活跃农村文娱生活也起了重大的作用。许多高小毕业生担任了党的宣传员、民校教师、读报员、图书管理员、剧团演员、广播员、黑板报撰写员等工作。据荣成县十一个区的统计，即有一百七十四名高小毕业生被聘为民校教师。
