Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch from Vietnam: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 19th, the following is the full text of the suggestions made by the representative of the French Far East Expeditionary Force General Command in Indochina to the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army on the 13th regarding the evacuation of wounded soldiers from Dien Bien Phu:

    The representative of the French General Command wishes to express his gratitude to the representative of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army for their active care of the French wounded soldiers out of humanitarian concern, and respectfully submits the following suggestions pending approval from the French General Command:

    (1) The representative of the French General Command would be most grateful to the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army if the evacuation of the wounded could be carried out as quickly as possible according to the following proposed conditions:

    (A) The first batch will include 450 wounded soldiers, including 250 seriously wounded. If the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army deems it appropriate, please consider releasing another batch of wounded soldiers.

    (B) The entire evacuation will be carried out by aircraft, using only helicopters, Morane, and Otter aircraft due to the current airport conditions.

    (C) Throughout the evacuation, all French aircraft activity within a 10-kilometer radius of Dien Bien Phu will cease, except for aircraft involved in the evacuation of the wounded. All aircraft activity will also cease on Highway 41 connecting Dien Bien Phu, Tuan Giao, and Son La.

    (D) The representative of the French General Command expresses his gratitude to the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army for their willingness to guarantee the repair of the Dien Bien Phu airport. However, the French representative wishes to state that due to the dense presence of landmines at the airport and its surroundings, it is impossible to avoid all accidents.

    (2) The representative of the French General Command requests that prisoners of war and wounded soldiers be allowed to communicate with their families.

    (3) The French representative also requests that empty ambulances be allowed to bring medical supplies, provisions, and clothing to the wounded and prisoners of war.

    (4) The French General Command will notify the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army of its official response as quickly as possible via the Yenzi military radio station.

                        General Cogny (signed)
                        French Commander of North Vietnam

    印度支那法军总司令部代表就撤退伤员问题提出的建议
    【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：印度支那法国远征军总司令部代表十三日就撤退奠边府伤员问题向越南人民军总司令部提出的建议，全文如下：
    法军总司令部代表愿向越南人民军总司令部代表表示感谢，感谢他们本着人道的关怀积极照料法军伤员，并谨提出尚待法军总司令部批准的如下建议：
    （一）如果撤运伤员的工作能够按照以下建议的条件尽速进行，法军总司令部代表将对越南人民军总司令部不胜感激，这些条件是：
    （甲）第一批将包括四百五十名伤员，其中包括二百五十名重伤人员。如果越南人民军总司令部认为适宜的话，请研究释放另一批伤员的问题。
    （乙）全部撤运工作将用飞机进行，由于目前的机场条件，只使用直升飞机、莫兰式和海獭式飞机。
    （丙）在整个撤运期间，除了参加撤运伤员的飞机外，其余法国飞机在奠边府周围十公里的地区内的活动一律停止。在连接奠边府、巡教和山萝的第四十一号公路上，所有飞机活动也一律停止。
    （丁）法军总司令部代表对越南人民军总司令部表示愿意保证修理奠边府机场的举动谨致谢忱。但是，法军代表愿意表明，由于机场及其四周密布地雷，要避免一切事故是不可能的。
    （二）法军总司令部代表要求让战俘和伤员与他们的家属通信。
    （三）法军代表也要求让空着来的救护机把医药用品、供应品和衣服带给伤员和战俘。
    （四）法军总司令部将通过燕子军中电台尽可能迅速地把正式答复通知越南人民军总司令部。
                北越法军司令戈涅将军（签字）
