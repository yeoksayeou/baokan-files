    Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency on May 6th: "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published a commentary on May 6th stating that at the invitation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam dispatched a delegation to attend the Geneva Conference to participate in discussions on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Van Dong, arrived in Geneva on May 4th.

    The very act of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sending a delegation to attend the Geneva Conference is a great victory for the Vietnamese people. This victory was achieved through the long and arduous struggle of the Vietnamese people.

    The commentary pointed out: Today, everyone knows that any issue concerning Vietnam cannot be resolved without the participation and opinions of the true and legitimate representatives of the people. The Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was established nine years ago, in 1945. Subsequently, the National Assembly elected in the general election of January 1946 elected the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh.

    In the past nine years, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have bravely resisted foreign aggression, defended national independence and freedom, and at the same time, established their political, economic, and cultural life according to their own free will. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been recognized by many countries with a total population of over 800 million and has established diplomatic relations with these countries.

    The international status of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is increasingly strengthened. Peace-loving people all over the world sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The facts are very clear: Today's Vietnam is different from the Vietnam of the past. In the past nine years, the Vietnamese people have stood up and gradually grown up in the patriotic struggle. However, the French and American imperialists stubbornly ignore this truth. They are still desperately trying to delay and expand their war of aggression, attempting to once again rule the Vietnamese people. They are still staging the same old farce, supporting the decadent puppet clique that is condemned and despised by all the Vietnamese people. This puppet clique can only represent a small handful of running dogs of imperialist aggressors. The American imperialists and French colonialists attempted to discuss the settlement of the Vietnam issue without the participation of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but their conspiracy failed. They finally had to agree to the participation of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the Geneva Conference. Inviting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in this conference is a victory for the Vietnamese people, and also a victory for the forces of world peace and democracy.

    The editorial concludes: The Vietnamese people resolutely support the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participating in the Geneva Conference and strive to restore peace and national rights in Indochina through consultation.

    越南“人民报”评越南民主共和国代表团参加日内瓦会议
    越南人民坚决争取恢复印度支那和平
    【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社六日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”六日发表评论说：胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府应苏联和中华人民共和国两国的邀请，派遣了一个代表团出席日内瓦会议，参加讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。以代理外交部部长范文同为首的越南民主共和国代表团已经在五月四日到达日内瓦。
    越南民主共和国政府派遣代表团出席日内瓦会议本身，就是越南人民的一个巨大的胜利。这个胜利是由于越南人民进行了长期的和艰苦的斗争而取得的。
    评论指出：今天，每个人都知道，如果没有人民的真正的合法代表的参加和表示意见，任何有关越南的问题都是不能得到解决的。越南民主共和国临时政府在九年以前即一九四五年就成立了，接着，在一九四六年一月的普选选出的国民大会选出了以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府。
    在过去九年中，越南人民在胡志明主席与越南民主共和国政府的英明领导下，英勇地反抗外国的侵略，保卫民族独立和自由，同时按照他们自己的自由意志，建立了他们的政治、经济与文化生活。越南民主共和国政府已经得到共有八亿多人口的许多国家的承认，并且和这些国家建立了外交关系。
    越南民主共和国的国际地位日益加强。全世界爱好和平的人民都同情和支持越南人民的正义斗争。事实十分明显：今天的越南已不同于过去的越南。在过去九年中，越南人民已经站起来了，并且已在爱国的斗争中逐渐成长起来了。但是，法、美帝国主义者对这个真理仍然顽固地置之不顾。他们仍然拚命想拖延和扩大他们的侵略战争，企图再度统治越南人民。他们还在导演那种老一套的滑稽戏，为受到全体越南人民所斥责与鄙弃的腐朽的傀儡集团捧场。这个傀儡集团只能代表一小撮帝国主义侵略者的走狗。美帝国主义者和法国殖民者企图在没有越南民主共和国政府参加的情况下讨论越南问题的解决，然而他们的阴谋没有得逞。他们最后不得不同意越南民主共和国政府参加日内瓦会议。邀请越南民主共和国参加这个会议，是越南人民的胜利，同时也是世界和平和民主力量的胜利。
    社论最后说：越南人民坚决支持参加日内瓦会议的越南民主共和国代表团，为争取通过协商恢复印度支那的和平与民族权利而努力。
