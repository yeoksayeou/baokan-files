    North China Region Plants Over 20 Million Mu of Cotton This Year
    Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations Play a Significant Role in Completing Cotton Planting Plans

    [This newspaper reports] The North China Region has exceeded the state cotton planting plan, sowing over 21 million mu of cotton fields, an expansion of more than 2.6 million mu compared to last year. Hebei Province has exceeded the plan by over 900,000 mu; Shanxi Province has also exceeded the cotton planting plan by more than 50,000 mu. Currently, leading bodies in most areas are paying close attention to replanting seedlings and protecting seedlings, vigorously overcoming the "a sigh of relief" mentality among cadres, conducting in-depth inspections, and adopting measures such as transporting soil, spot replanting, and replanting based on specific seedling deficiency situations, actively leading the masses to carry out seedling inspection and replanting. Lincheng County has launched a competition centered around "inspecting and replanting seedlings, combating drought and spot planting, ensuring tasks, and ensuring full seedlings," spot planting more than 43,000 mu throughout the county, basically achieving full seedlings, and the 10,000 mu with severe seedling deficiencies have also been replanted. In six counties including Li County and Xingtang, a total of 168,000 mu of cotton fields were deficient in seedlings; preliminary statistics show that 100,800 mu have been replanted.

    The North China Region is one of the major cotton-producing areas in the country, with its output accounting for approximately 30 percent of the total national output. The development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various parts of the region has played a significant role in completing and exceeding the state cotton planting plan. According to statistics from more than 680 agricultural production cooperatives in eight counties including Nangong and Gaocheng in Hebei Province, the average excess completion of the cotton planting plan is over 18 percent. According to statistics from 69 agricultural production cooperatives in three counties including Yuci in Shanxi Province, the cotton planting area has increased fourfold compared to last year. Some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, also helped families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and households without labor to complete planting in a timely manner during the rush to sow with soil moisture.

    Leadership bodies at all levels in the North China Region attach great importance to cotton planting work. The North China Administrative Committee has dispatched work teams to Hebei and Shanxi provinces twice to assist in cotton planting. Leading bodies at all levels in the two provinces have also dispatched more than 20,000 cadres to go to the countryside to lead farmers in planting. In addition, during cotton planting, various places have also promptly done a good job in supplying grain and other materials.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 21st: The new and old agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province have played a role in guaranteeing and leading the effort to exceed this year's cotton planting plan. During cotton planting, in all agricultural production cooperatives in both old and new cotton-growing areas throughout the province, wherever it was suitable for planting cotton, the cotton field area was appropriately expanded and their cotton planting plans were revised according to the requirements of the state. Geng Changsuo, a famous agricultural labor model, immediately convened a cooperative management committee with the village's Party branch secretary after seeing the Hebei Provincial People's Government's cotton planting plan in the newspaper, increasing the originally planned cotton planting area by another 140 mu. At the mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings before spring plowing, 1,364 agricultural production cooperatives in four counties, including Wu'an, Anguo, and Mancheng, expanded their cotton planting plans from the original 43,900 mu to 62,700 mu.

    The more than 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the cotton-growing areas of Hebei Province have set an example for farmers throughout the province in planting cotton. Wang Zhiqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongchuankou Village, Xingtai County, planted 270 mu of cotton this year according to the state plan, of which 240 mu were planted by carrying water, totaling more than 22,800 loads of water, and sometimes needing to carry water from mountain slopes more than three miles away. Many agricultural production cooperatives also actively helped mutual aid groups and individual farmers during planting. In Baoding Prefecture, over 3,000 agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to helping mutual aid groups and individual farmers plant cotton, also responded to the call of the Baoding Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, fixing two or three mutual aid groups as long-term cultivation targets in order to create conditions to help them improve into agricultural production cooperatives.

    华北全区今年植棉二千多万亩
    互助合作组织对完成植棉计划起很大作用
    【本报讯】华北区已超额完成国家植棉计划，播种了棉田二千一百多万亩，比去年扩大二百六十多万亩。河北省超额九十多万亩完成计划；山西省也超过植棉计划五万多亩。现在，大部地区的领导机关对补苗保苗工作都很重视，正大力克服干部中“松一口气”的思想，深入进行检查，并根据具体缺苗情况，分别采取挑土、点补、重种等办法，积极领导群众开展查苗补苗。临城县并以“查苗补苗、抗旱点种、保证任务、保证全苗”为内容展开竞赛，全县点种四万三千多亩，基本上得到全苗，缺苗严重的一万亩也已经重种。蠡县、行唐等六县的棉田共缺苗十六万八千余亩，初步统计已补种或重种十万零八千余亩。
    华北区是全国主要产棉区之一，产量约占全国总产量百分之三十。全区各地互助合作组织的发展，对完成和超额完成国家植棉计划起了很大作用。河北省据南宫、藁城等八县六百八十多个农业生产合作社的统计，平均超额完成植棉计划百分之十八以上。山西省据榆次等三县六十九个农业生产合作社的统计，植棉面积比去年增加四倍。河北省武安县有些农业生产合作社和互助组在抢墒播种中，还帮助革命烈士家属和革命军人家属以及无劳动力户适时完成播种。
    华北区各级领导机关对植棉工作都很重视。华北行政委员会曾两次派遣工作组到河北、山西两省协助植棉。两省各级领导机关也抽出二万多名干部分别下乡领导农民播种。此外，在棉花播种中，各地还及时作好了粮食等物资供应工作。
    据新华社保定二十一日电：河北省的新老农业生产合作社，在超额完成今年植棉计划当中起了保证作用和领导作用。棉花播种时，全省无论老棉区和新棉区，凡是适于种植棉花的地方的农业生产合作社，都按照国家要求，适当扩大棉田面积，修改自己的植棉计划。著名农业劳动模范耿长锁，在报纸上看到河北省人民政府的植棉计划后，立即协同这个村的支部书记召开社务管理委员会进行讨论，将原计划植棉面积又增加一百四十亩。在春耕前的互助合作代表会议上，武安、安国、满城等四县就有一千三百六十四个农业生产合作社，将植棉计划由原来四万三千九百多亩扩大到六万两千七百亩。
    河北省棉区两万多个农业生产合作社，在种棉当中给全省农民作出了榜样。邢台县东川口村王志琪农业生产合作社今年按照国家计划种了二百七十亩棉花，其中就有二百四十亩是挑水点种的，总共挑水两万二千八百多担，有时还需到往返三里多远的山坡去担水。许多农业生产合作社在播种中还积极帮助互助组和单干农民。保定专区三千多个农业生产合作社，除帮助互助组和单干农民种植棉花外，并响应中共保定地方委员会的号召，固定两三个互助组作为长期培养对象，以便创造条件，帮助他们提高为农业生产合作社。
