Xinhua News Agency, 11th. According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "Official Representatives of the Khmer and Lao Resistance Governments Should Participate in the Resolution of the Khmer and Lao Issues."

    The editorial said: The people and governments of Khmer and Laos have expressed their support for the Geneva Conference and are willing to restore peace in Khmer and Laos on the basis of respecting the national independence and freedom of the people of these two countries.

    The editorial stated that the Vietnamese people warmly support the statement of the Khmer and Lao resistance governments requesting to participate in the Geneva Conference. The editorial pointed out that Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's speech at the Geneva Conference reflected the wishes of all the Vietnamese people who are fighting side by side with the Khmer and Lao people.

    The editorial said: It is absurd to try to solve the problems of these two countries without the participation of official representatives of the resistance governments of Khmer and Laos.

    The people of Khmer and Laos, under the leadership of their resistance governments, have been bravely fighting against the imperialist aggressors. The resistance governments of Khmer and Laos were elected by the people's congresses of these two countries. The resistance regimes have been established from the central to the local levels, and have won the trust and support of the vast majority of the people of Khmer and Laos.

    In contrast, the French imperialists are now maintaining corrupt colonial regimes in their occupied areas under the guise of national independence. The French imperialists are propping up puppet cliques. These puppet cliques, having long acted as running dogs of imperialism, are spurned by all the people of Khmer and Laos, and therefore cannot represent anyone, but are merely loyal servants of foreign aggressors. Therefore, in order to smoothly resolve the issues of Khmer and Laos, the resistance governments of these two countries should be allowed to send their official representatives to participate in the discussions.

    The editorial concluded: The Vietnamese people hope that the representatives of the major powers attending the Geneva Conference will accept the reasonable demands of the Khmer and Lao resistance governments and the just proposals put forward by the chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, so that the official representatives of the Khmer and Lao resistance governments can quickly attend the Geneva Conference and make due contributions to the discussion of the issue of restoring peace in Indochina.

    越南“人民报”发表社论指出
    高棉寮国抗战政府代表应参加日内瓦会议
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南“人民报”发表社论，题目是“高棉和寮国抗战政府的正式代表应当参加高棉和寮国问题的解决”。
    社论说：高棉和寮国的人民和政府已经表示支持日内瓦会议，并愿意在尊重这两国人民的民族独立和自由的基础上，恢复高棉和寮国的和平。
    社论表示，越南人民热烈支持高棉和寮国抗战政府要求参加日内瓦会议的声明。社论指出，范文同副总理在日内瓦会议的发言，反映了和高棉及寮国人民并肩斗争的越南全体人民的愿望。
    社论说：妄想在没有高棉和寮国两国抗战政府的正式代表参加的情况下，解决这两个国家的问题，是荒谬的。
    高棉和寮国的人民在他们的抗战政府领导下，一直在英勇地进行反对帝国主义侵略者的斗争。高棉和寮国的抗战政府是由这两国的人民代表大会选举出来的。抗战政权从中央到地方都建立起来了，得到高棉和寮国绝大多数人民的信任和支持。
    与此相反，法国帝国主义者现在正在他们的占领区，以民族独立的幌子，维持腐败的殖民政权。法国帝国主义者正在给傀儡集团撑腰。而这些傀儡集团，由于长期充当帝国主义的走狗，为高棉和寮国的全体人民所唾弃，因而不能代表任何人，只不过是外国侵略者的忠实奴仆而已。因此，要顺利解决高棉和寮国的问题，就应当让这两国的抗战政府派遣它们的正式代表参加讨论。
    社论最后说：越南人民希望出席日内瓦会议的各大国代表，接受高棉和寮国抗战政府的合理要求和越南民主共和国代表团首席代表提出的正义建议，以便高棉和寮国抗战政府的正式代表能迅速出席日内瓦会议，对恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论作出应有的贡献。
