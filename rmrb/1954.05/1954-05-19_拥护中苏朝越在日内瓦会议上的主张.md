For ourselves and for the happiness of the next generation, we love peace and will defend peace with practical actions.

They believe that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech represents the wishes of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, and they expressed their intention to further exert their strength and accelerate the construction of the motherland.
    Wang Xin, the author of "Ode to the Motherland," said at a forum at the Central Conservatory of Music: We peace-loving Chinese people are very concerned about the progress of the Geneva Conference. The delegations of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressed the heartfelt wishes of the Asian people who love peace at the Geneva Conference in a righteous and confident manner. We firmly support their solemn position and propositions. Medical workers from the Tianjin Municipal General Hospital also held a forum.

At the forum, Gao Huanzhang, vice chairman of the trade union, said: The speeches of the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam have strengthened the confidence of the people of the world in the struggle to defend peace. We will definitely put all our strength into the construction of the motherland and continuously enhance the strength to defend peace. The planing team of the second workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory is an advanced team in Shenyang. In the past few days, the workers of the whole team have often discussed news related to the Geneva Conference. They said: We not only support the correct propositions of the representatives of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and Vietnam, but also take practical actions to defend peace, further improve productivity, actively promote high-speed cutting methods, and accelerate the industrial construction of the motherland. Zhang Guobin, the leader of this team, representing all the team members, said: Guarantee to complete the May production task two days ahead of schedule, and reduce the scrap rate in May by 50% compared with April.
    Train driver Ma Zhanyou, who had participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and won the military medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: We have personally seen the disasters that war has brought to peace-loving people and the atrocities of US imperialism in Korea. Therefore, we all understand the preciousness of peace. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's and Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposition on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. During the Geneva Conference, the workers of the Ma Zhanyou locomotive team, in order to express their determination to strive for peace, increased the coal saving rate in April, exceeding the original plan by more than two times. Since the Geneva Conference, many family members of the Chinese People's Volunteers have continuously written letters to Korea to encourage their relatives, urging them to be vigilant and prevent the US aggressors from sabotaging the armistice in Korea. Wang Fengyun and Li Xiukun, models of military dependents, said: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech expressed the heartfelt words of the Chinese people. Today, our Chinese people are living a free and happy life, and we also hope that the people of other Asian countries will not be oppressed and will also have a free and happy life.

    Advanced Workers Such as the Lu A'gou Group in Shanghai
    The nationally renowned advanced production team—the Lu A'gou team of the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory and the national textile industry labor model Yi Shijuan of the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory— wholeheartedly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai’s speech at the Geneva Conference. Even before the Geneva Conference—on April 25—the workers of the Lu A’gou team held a forum during their work break. From the day the Geneva Conference officially opened, they made sure to read the news about the Geneva Conference in the newspaper whether before or after work. They excitedly told their loved ones about the news that the representatives of the People's Republic of China were participating in the Geneva Conference, and they patiently explained the news from the Geneva Conference to their children. Especially when they saw in the newspapers the six proposals by North Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the eight proposals by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and the righteous propositions repeatedly made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, how excited they were! National textile industry labor model Yi Shijuan said: Foreign Minister Zhou’s speech represents the views of all the people of China and Asia. Guo Yongkui, a veteran worker of the Lu A’gou team, said: We workers rely on labor to eat, while US imperialism relies on fighting wars and exploitation to eat. We don’t want to fight wars. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou’s advocacy of peace. When they saw the lies of US Dulles in the newspaper, they unanimously expressed their indignation. Ying Zhongfa, the leader of the Lu A'gou team and a Shanghai municipal hardware industry labor model, said: There is only one truth, and the imperialists cannot escape it. Many workers are supporting Foreign Minister Zhou’s speech with their actual actions in production. At the Geneva Conference forum held by the team on April 25, Zhou Minggao, a veteran worker of the Lu A'gou team, made an improved suggestion for a "heavy hammer hook bending die" (used for making parts for spinning machines) for supporting the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. It was completed ahead of schedule before the "May Day" holiday, increasing efficiency by three and a half times, and the May task was completed on May 7. Now they are supporting Foreign Minister Zhou’s speech with practical actions and expecting the Geneva Conference to achieve complete success. (Our East China Reporter Station)
