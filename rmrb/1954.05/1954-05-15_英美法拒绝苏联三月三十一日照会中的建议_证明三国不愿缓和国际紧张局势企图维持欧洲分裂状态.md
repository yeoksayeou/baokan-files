Xinhua News Agency, London, May 14th (TASS dispatch): Newspaper reports indicate that the British government, along with the United States and French governments, sent a note of identical content to the Soviet government, responding to the Soviet government's note of March 31st of this year.

As everyone knows, the Soviet government's note emphasized that the establishment of an all-European security system based on the collective efforts of European countries is of great significance for maintaining peace in Europe and the world. The note also stated that the Soviet government believes there are no obstacles to supporting the United States' participation in the "All-European Treaty Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe." The note further stated that the Soviet government disagrees with the opinions of the United States and France, who say that the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" is defensive in nature and not aimed at any country or certain countries. In fact, quite the opposite, this pact "establishes an exclusive group of certain countries, which neglects the task of preventing the resurgence of German aggression, and because only the Soviet Union among the major countries that participated in the anti-Hitler alliance has not joined the North Atlantic Treaty, it cannot but be regarded as an aggressive treaty aimed at the Soviet Union."

Based on this, the Soviet government, in accordance with the principles of its consistent and unwavering peaceful foreign policy and the desire to ease international tensions, expressed its readiness to jointly study with relevant countries the issue of the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. The Soviet note stated: "In this case, the 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization' will no longer be a narrow military group of certain countries, but will become an organization that other European countries can participate in, which will not only establish an effective European collective security system, but also be of extreme importance to the consolidation of universal peace."

In their reply, the three Western countries rejected the Soviet government's proposal and claimed, without presenting any evidence, that these proposals would not help to ease tensions and eliminate division in Europe. Their notes also stated that the establishment of a collective security system would damage the prestige of the United Nations. However, the authors of the reply did not consider how the current existence of the North Atlantic Treaty could be reconciled with maintaining the prestige of the United Nations in this situation.

The Western countries rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to join the North Atlantic Treaty in their note because they were afraid of "disintegrating" those "defense alliances," that is, the military groups that some countries have already established or are establishing for the purpose of opposing other countries. In this way, the three Western countries actually openly admitted that they are in favor of maintaining the current state of division in Europe, although they are trying to shift this responsibility onto the Soviet Union.

The Soviet proposal was entirely aimed at establishing an effective European collective security system in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet note pointed out: "If all European countries work together to establish a European security system to replace military groups of European countries that are mutually opposed, then this problem can be successfully resolved."

The Western countries' reply attempts to place the responsibility for failing to resolve the issue of restoring Germany's unification and failing to conclude an Austrian peace treaty at the Berlin Conference on the Soviet Union. However, everyone knows that it was the Soviet Union that put forward constructive proposals on these two issues at the Berlin Conference, and these proposals were rejected by the three Western countries.

The Soviet government believes that the "European Defence Community" is a serious threat to European peace. However, the Western countries defended this "group" in their notes, and they did not conceal that this "group" was used to "solve the problem of Germany's contribution to defense," that is, to establish an aggressive German Wehrmacht and allow German militarism to do whatever it wants. The Soviet note justly pointed out: "Going down the road of reviving German militarism and establishing European military groups will not only not help consolidate peace, but will pave the way for new wars."

The Soviet government's note aroused particularly hostile reactions from U.S. officials. The U.S. State Department even hurriedly rejected the note before it had even received it in Washington. Following this, the American bourgeois newspapers and some American senators, as if ordered, jointly opposed the Soviet proposal.

This hasty attitude aroused surprise and disappointment in Western European public opinion. The British "News Chronicle" wrote that when rejecting the Soviet government's note, the United States "does not seem to have considered that such a tactic may cause unease and resentment in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (i.e., the participating countries of the North Atlantic Group), which should be taken into account." Former British Labour government Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison, speaking in the British House of Commons on April 1st about the Soviet note of March 31st, said: "The United States should not issue a statement immediately without consulting the British government." Morrison also said that the British government should deal with the issue of European security on its own "regardless of what other governments may say."

The rejection of the Soviet note of March 31st of this year by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France cannot but arouse and is arousing the surprise and disappointment of public opinion in many countries. Democrats in these countries see that the Western countries, especially the United States, have taken this step, which shows that they are unwilling to ease international tensions and safeguard peace and security in Europe and the world.

### 英美法拒绝苏联三月三十一日照会中的建议  证明三国不愿缓和国际紧张局势企图维持欧洲分裂状态

    英美法拒绝苏联三月三十一日照会中的建议
    证明三国不愿缓和国际紧张局势企图维持欧洲分裂状态
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦十四日电：报纸消息，英国政府曾与美国和法国政府以同样内容的照会一件送交苏联政府，答复苏联政府今年三月三十一日的照会。
    大家知道，苏联政府的照会着重指出，建立以欧洲各国的集体努力为基础的全欧安全体系对于维护欧洲和平与世界和平具有非常重大的意义。照会又说，苏联政府认为，赞成美国参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”并没有什么障碍。照会进一步说，苏联政府不同意美国与法国的意见，美国与法国说，“北大西洋公约组织”是防御性质的，不是为了对付某个国家或是某些国家。事实上恰好相反，这个公约“建立一个某些国家的排他的集团，它忽视防止德国侵略再起这一任务，并且由于在参加反希特勒联盟的大国中，只有苏联没有参加北大西洋公约，因此不能不认为这个公约是一个矛头指向苏联的侵略性的条约。”
    苏联政府根据这一点，本着它的一贯不变的和平外交政策的原则和缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，表示准备和有关国家共同研究苏联参加北大西洋公约的问题。苏联照会说：“在这种情况下，‘北大西洋公约组织’就不会再是一个某些国家的狭隘的军事集团了，而会成为欧洲其他国家都可参加的组织，这样不但能建立一个有效的欧洲集体安全体系，而且对巩固普遍和平，也具有极其重要的意义。”
    西方三国在它们的复照中拒绝了苏联政府的建议，并且没有提出任何证据就硬说这些建议无助于缓和欧洲紧张局势和消除分裂。它们的照会又说，建立集体安全体系会损害联合国的威信。然而，复照的作者在说这种话的时候并没有想一想，在这种情况下，目前北大西洋公约的存在如何能与保持联合国的威信相调和。
    西方国家在照会中拒绝苏联提出的参加北大西洋公约的建议，这是因为它们害怕使那些“防务同盟”，即若干国家已经建立或正在建立的目的在反对另一些国家的军事集团“瓦解”。这样看来，三个西方国家实际上就是公开承认了：它们赞成维持目前欧洲的分裂状态，虽然它们力图把这种责任推卸在苏联身上。
    苏联的建议完完全全是为了按照联合国宪章的原则建立一个有效的欧洲集体安全体系。苏联照会中指出：“如果所有的欧洲国家共同努力来建立欧洲安全体系，以代替互相对立的欧洲国家的军事集团，那末这一问题就能顺利解决。”
    西方国家的复照企图把在柏林会议上未能解决恢复德国的统一问题和未能缔结对奥和约问题的责任加在苏联身上。然而大家知道，在柏林会议上，就这两项问题提出建设性建议的正是苏联，而这些建议都为西方三国所拒绝了。
    苏联政府认为“欧洲防务集团”是对欧洲和平的严重威胁。而西方国家在它们的照会中却替这一“集团”辩护，它们并不掩饰这一“集团”是用来“解决德国对防务有所贡献的问题”，这就是说，建立侵略性的德国国防军和让德国军国主义为所欲为。苏联照会中曾公正地指出：“走复活德国军国主义和建立欧洲军事集团的道路，这不仅无助于巩固和平，反而为新战争铺平道路。”
    苏联政府的照会引起了美国官方人士的特别敌视的反应。美国国务院甚至在它还没有在华盛顿收到照会之前，就匆匆忙忙拒绝了这一照会。跟着美国资产阶级报纸和一些美国参议员，好像得到命令一样，一同反对苏联的建议。
    这种匆忙的态度引起了西欧舆论的惊奇和失望。英国“新闻纪事报”写道，美国在拒绝苏联政府的照会时，“似乎没有考虑到这样一种策略可能在北大西洋公约组织各国（即北大西洋集团的参与国）引起不安和愤慨，而这是应当考虑的。”前英国工党政府外交大臣赫伯特·摩里逊四月一日在英国下院谈到三月三十一日苏联的照会时说：“美国不应当在没有同英国政府商量之前，就立即发表声明。”摩里逊又说，英国政府应当“不顾别国政府可能说什么”，而自行处理欧洲安全的问题。
    美、英、法三国政府拒绝今年三月三十一日的苏联照会，不能不引起而且正在引起许多国家舆论的惊奇和失望。这些国家的民主人士看到，西方国家，首先是美国采取这一步骤，就表明它们不愿意缓和国际紧张局势，保障欧洲及世界的和平与安全。
