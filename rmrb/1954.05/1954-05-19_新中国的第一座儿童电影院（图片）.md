The motherland places great care on the future builders - the children. The first children's cinema in our country, built specifically for children in Changchun last year, has now opened this year. The equipment in this cinema is very complete. The lounge has many small velvet chairs specially made for children; fresh flowers are placed on each table, and various toys are provided to make children feel very comfortable during their rest. In addition, there is also a reading room and a service department in the cinema. When children are resting from watching movies, they can read various books and buy various candies here.

The children are all attracted by the plot of the movie.

The children's cinema has a lounge, which provides various toys for children. This is a scene of children playing checkers under the care of the attendants.

    新中国的第一座儿童电影院
    祖国对未来的建设者——儿童寄以极大的关怀。长春市在去年专为孩子们修建的我国第一座儿童电影院已在今年开幕。这所电影院的设备很完善。休息室里给孩子们特制了许多小绒椅；每张桌子上都摆着鲜花，并备有各种玩具，使孩子们在休息时感到非常舒适。另外，院内还设有阅览室和服务部，在看电影休息的时候，孩子们可以在这里阅读各种书籍和买各种糖果。
