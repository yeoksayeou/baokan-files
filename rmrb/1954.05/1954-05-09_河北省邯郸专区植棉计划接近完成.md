Hebei Province Handan Prefecture's cotton planting plan is nearing completion. Wu'an, Shexian, Daming, Cheng'an, Guangping, Jize, Qiuxian and eight other counties have exceeded the original plan by more than 70,000 mu. Cixian, Quzhou, Handan, and Linzhang counties have completed more than 80% of the original plan.

Currently, the counties that have not completed the plan are actively rectifying and adjusting leadership, mobilizing the masses, seizing the moisture to rush planting or carrying water for spot planting, and striving to overfulfill the plan. Counties that have completed and overfulfilled their tasks have now turned to checking seedlings and replanting. Some cadres and farmers were eager to take advantage of the moisture to sow seeds after the rain, and the sowing was somewhat rough. Some planted at uneven depths, or used cold water to soak the seeds, and in addition, the recent climate change and abnormal soil temperature have affected the emergence of seedlings. In Wu'an County, out of more than 500,000 mu of cotton fields in the county, 70% had 70% to 80% seedling emergence; 20% had 50% seedling emergence; and 10% had less than 40% seedling emergence. In view of this situation, the Wu'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China has urgently instructed all districts to do a good job in checking seedlings and replanting. It also convened a meeting of technicians from the whole county, and the county technical station taught the technology of checking and replanting seedlings, and printed it into a technical manual for checking and replanting seedlings and distributed it to district and township cadres. Each district also held a meeting of district and township cadres to teach the technology of checking and replanting seedlings. Now cadres at all levels are going to the countryside to lead farmers in checking and replanting seedlings.

    河北省邯郸专区植棉计划接近完成
    河北省邯郸专区植棉计划已接近完成。武安、涉县、大名、成安、广平、鸡泽、邱县等八个县超过原计划七万多亩。磁县、曲周、邯郸、临漳等县已完成原计划的百分之八十以上。
    现在，没有完成计划的县份，正积极整顿和调剂领导力量，发动群众，借墒抢种或担水点种，争取超额完成计划。已完成和超额完成任务的县份，现已转向查苗补苗工作。有些干部和农民在雨后急于趁墒播种，播种有些粗糙，有的种得深浅不匀，或因用凉水浸种，又加近日气候变化，地温不正常，影响齐苗。武安县全县棉田五十多万亩，出苗七成至八成的占百分之七十；出苗五成的占百分之二十；出苗四成以下的占百分之十。根据这种情况，中共武安县委已紧急指示各区要做好查苗补苗工作。并召集全县技术员开会，由县技术站传授查苗、补苗技术，并印成查苗、补苗技术手册发给区、乡干部。各区也召开区、乡干部会议，传授了查苗补苗技术。现各级干部正下乡领导农民查苗补苗。
