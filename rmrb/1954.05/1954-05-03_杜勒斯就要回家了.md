    Dulles is About to Go Home
    By our correspondents Wu Wentao and Du Bo
    The Geneva Conference has been going on for five days. According to the agreement, the conference will be adjourned today (May 1st) and will not hold meetings on May 2nd (Sunday). Dulles will leave Geneva on May 3rd.
    In the past few days, the delegations have spoken in order. Only the representatives of South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Colombia, the United States, the People's Republic of China, Australia, the Soviet Union, Thailand, and Turkey have spoken. So far, the conference only has the proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    The Chinese and Soviet delegations unanimously agreed to take the reasonable proposal of Foreign Minister Nam Il as the basis for consultation. Their constructive speeches generally produced good and profound reactions. The "Times" reporter in London also said, when summarizing the public opinion in Geneva, that Foreign Minister Zhou's speech was "reasonable" and a "powerful statement." Although U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arbitrarily rejected Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal, he could only rehash the old tune of the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations in October 1950, which called for the so-called "election supervision in North Korea by the Korean Temporary Committee". Those who echoed Dulles' old tune included the representatives of Thailand and Turkey, who were the only speakers at the April 30th conference. Their speeches lasted only twenty minutes in total, and the content was so poor. For example, the Thai prince and foreign minister's promotion of Thailand's "independence" and "freedom" was nothing more than "open door" and "equal opportunity" for imperialism.
    Judging from the general public opinion in Europe and Geneva, the U.S. Secretary of State's speech on April 28th did not receive any "warm" response worth mentioning. Apart from his boring slanders and attempts to shift the responsibility for the Korean War, which he personally participated in launching, onto others, his first point was to openly oppose the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea, and one-sidedly demand that the Chinese People's Volunteers who support the Korean people who were invaded and defend their motherland withdraw from North Korea, allowing the brutal autocratic regime of Syngman Rhee to rule the entire Korea with the help of the U.S. military. But how could this dream, which the United States failed to achieve through armed intervention, be realized in a few words at the Geneva Conference?
    Dulles' "reason" for opposing the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from Korea is: the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers only means five miles, while the withdrawal of U.S. troops means five thousand miles, and it will take at least a few weeks to return to Korea! This kind of "eloquence" has simply become a joke among the news reporters here.
    At the press conferences of the Soviet and Chinese delegations, the speakers raised questions that aroused the reporters' sympathy: If all foreign armed forces are withdrawn, and the Korean people can peacefully resolve their own problems freely and without external influence, what are the U.S. troops planning to do when they return to Korea? According to Dulles' novel logic, one should not withdraw troops if the road is far. Then why is it possible to send troops to Korea for aggression? Indochina is not closer to the United States than Korea, so why is the United States so keen on intervening? Since the geographical distance will not change, can U.S. troops never withdraw from Korea? Dulles also said that U.S. troops withdrew from South Korea before, and then the Korean War broke out. Therefore, he does not want history to repeat itself. But if it were not for the United States instigating the Syngman Rhee clique to launch the war, and then participating in the war itself, would there have been more than three years of bloodshed?
    Dulles' other magic weapon is to use the supervision of the illegal "United Nations Korean Temporary Committee" to "solve the Korean problem." He stubbornly argued: Without the supervision of the United Nations, how can the Korean people hold free elections themselves? The elections in South Korea have such supervision... On April 29th, while simply reporting Dulles' speech, the Paris newspaper "Liberation" revealed under the title "The President Doesn't Like Anyone Running Against Him" that Syngman Rhee used force against those who dared to express their own opinions. The newspaper sarcastically wrote: "...Mr. Dulles said at the Geneva Conference: Syngman Rhee is a symbol of freedom!" The newspaper's evaluation of Dulles is: "Mr. Dulles is such a strange person, he is so naive and cunning, hypocritical and mysterious... He can patiently create various tortuous legal traps for his political conspiracies, and put on a legal cloak for it." As for Byun Rong-tae, the Paris newspaper "Le Monde" on April 30th directly compared him to Tartarin, a character in the famous French novelist Daudet (note: Tartarin is a ridiculous person who likes to talk and boast).
    Yes, in the first week of the conference, people did not get anything new from the speeches of Dulles and his cronies. Some sharp Western journalists are increasingly trying to get ideas at the press conferences of the British, French and American delegations. At the British delegation's reception on April 30th, someone asked the British delegation's spokesman: "Why haven't European countries spoken at the meeting?" He pondered for a moment and could only come up with the name "Turkey" to cope with the situation. People probably felt that Mr. Bidault was absent-minded when discussing the Korean issue, so they asked the French delegation's spokesman: "Why hasn't Mr. Bidault spoken yet?" The spokesman said: "He doesn't have any new ideas yet." Also on April 30th, the U.S. delegation's spokesman's answer to the question "When will the British delegation speak" was "No comment." He grumbled incessantly that "Mr. Molotov and Mr. Zhou Enlai have done their best to hinder a 'Pacific security system'," and then praised Turkey and Thailand, which had spoken at the meeting. Naturally, the subtext of this remark was nothing but the United States' whipping of some of its Western allies, or a sigh after the whipping was ineffective. Isn't it? The French delegation's spokesman reminded reporters at the reception: "The real solution to the problem will still be on the banquet table!" Some British newspapers have also made such remarks.
    As the Geneva Conference is about to turn to the Indochina issue, and the Korean issue is entering group discussions, U.S. Undersecretary of State Smith came to Geneva to take over, and Dulles officially announced that he was going home. Of course, Dulles' attempt to sabotage the Geneva Conference will not be abandoned. But Western journalists are already commenting on Dulles' performance as the Western "leadership role" at this conference. Geneva, May 1st

### 杜勒斯就要回家了

    杜勒斯就要回家了
    本报记者　吴文焘　杜　波
    日内瓦会议已经开了五天。根据协议，大会今天（五月一日）休会一天，五月二日（星期日）也不举行会议。杜勒斯在五月三日就要离开日内瓦了。
    这几天里，发言的代表团按次序说，只有南朝鲜、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、哥伦比亚、美国、中华人民共和国、澳大利亚、苏联、泰国和土耳其；算起来，会议还只有南日外务相所提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。
    中苏两国代表一致同意以南日外务相这个合理的提案作为协商的基础。他们的富有建设性的发言普遍产生了良好和深刻的反应。伦敦“泰晤士报”记者在归纳日内瓦的舆论时也说周外长的发言是“合乎情理的”、“强有力的声明”。美国国务卿杜勒斯虽然武断地拒绝了南日外务相的提案，而他自己却只能把一九五零年十月那个联合国非法通过的、由所谓“朝鲜临时委员会监督在北朝鲜选举”的滥调，重新弹了一遍。附和杜勒斯的这一滥调的，可以举出在三十日大会上仅有的发言者泰国和土耳其的代表来。他们二人的讲话一共不过二十多分钟，而内容又是那样的贫乏。例如，泰国的王公外长所宣扬的泰国的“独立”和“自由”，不过是对帝国主义的“门户开放”和“机会均等”而已。
    从欧洲和日内瓦的一般舆论来看，美国国务卿四月二十八日的这次发言，是没有得到什么任何可以提得到的“热烈”反应的。他除了无聊的诽谤和企图把他亲自参加发动的朝鲜战争的责任推到别人身上以外，首先就是公开反对把美国侵略军从南朝鲜撤退，而片面地要求支援被侵略的朝鲜人民和保卫自己祖国安全的中国人民志愿军撤离北朝鲜，让李承晚的残暴专制政权在美国军队帮助下统治全部朝鲜。但是，这一个美国用武装干涉所未能实现的梦想，又怎能在日内瓦会议上用几句话来实现呢？
    杜勒斯反对从朝鲜撤退美国侵略军的“理由”是：中国人民志愿军的撤退只意味着什么五英里，而美国军队的撤退却意味着五千英里，回到朝鲜来至少需要几个星期！这种“雄辩”，简直已经成了这里的新闻记者们的一种笑料了。
    在苏联和中国代表团的记者招待会上，发言人们曾这样地提出了问题，引起了记者们的同情的反应：如果一切外国武装力量都撤退了，朝鲜人民得以自由而不受外力影响地和平解决自己的问题，美国军队还打算回到朝鲜来干什么？按照杜勒斯的新奇的逻辑，路远了就不应该撤军，那末，为什么可能派兵到朝鲜来进行侵略呢？印度支那离美国也不比朝鲜近些，美国为什么又那样热中于干涉呢？地理上的距离既是不会改变的，美国军队也就可以永远不从朝鲜撤退吗？杜勒斯还说，从前美国军队退出了南朝鲜，而朝鲜发生了战争，因此，他不想让历史重演了。但是，如果不是美国唆使李承晚集团发动了战争，而后又自己参加了这个战争，那会有三年多的流血呢？
    杜勒斯的另一个法宝，就是想用非法的“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”的监督选举来“解决朝鲜问题”。他强辩说：没有联合国的监督，朝鲜人民如何能够自己举行自由选举？南朝鲜的选举是有这种监督的……。四月二十九日，在简单报道杜勒斯的发言时，巴黎“解放报”就在“总统不喜欢有人和他竞选”的标题下，揭露了李承晚用武力对付敢于发表自己意见的人。该报讽刺地写道：“……杜勒斯先生在日内瓦会议上说：李承晚乃是自由的象征呢！”该报对于杜勒斯的评价是：“杜勒斯先生真是个奇异的人，他是那样天真而狡猾，虚伪而神秘，……他能够耐性地为他的政治阴谋制作种种曲折的法律圈套，使它披上合法的外衣。”至于像卞荣泰，四月三十日的巴黎“世界报”就直接地把他比作法国名小说家都德笔下的人物达达兰（按：达达兰是一个爱哓舌、爱自夸的可笑的人）。
    是的，在第一周的会议中，人们没有从杜勒斯和他的小伙计们的发言中得到任何新的东西。一些锐敏的西方新闻记者们就愈来愈想在英、法和美国代表团的记者招待会上打主意了。在三十日的英国代表团的招待会上，有人向英国代表团的发言人提出了这样的问题：“为什么在会上没有欧洲国家发言呢？”他沉思了一下，只能把“土耳其”的名字搬出来应付一下。人们大概感觉皮杜尔先生对于讨论朝鲜问题是心不在焉的，就问法国代表团发言人：“皮杜尔先生为何至今还未讲话呢？”发言人说：“他还没有什么新的意见。”也在三十日，美国代表团的发言人对于“英国代表团何时发言”这个问题的回答是“无可奉告”。他呶呶不休地怨恨“莫洛托夫先生和周恩来先生已经尽了他们阻碍一个‘太平洋安全体系’的能事”，接着他就赞扬了一番在会上发了言的土耳其和泰国。很自然地，这一席话的弦外之音不是别的，而是美国对它的一些西方盟国们的鞭笞，或者是鞭笞乏效后的叹息。不是吗？法国代表团的发言人就在招待会上提醒记者们注意：“真正解决问题还要在宴会的桌子上！”英国的一些报纸也早有这样的言论。
    在日内瓦会议的大会即将转入印度支那问题、朝鲜问题进入小组讨论的时候，美国的副国务卿史密斯来日内瓦接班了，杜勒斯正式声明他要回家去了。当然杜勒斯破坏日内瓦会议的企图是不会放弃的。但西方的记者们已在评论着杜勒斯在这次会议上所表演的西方“领导脚色”了。五月一日于日内瓦
