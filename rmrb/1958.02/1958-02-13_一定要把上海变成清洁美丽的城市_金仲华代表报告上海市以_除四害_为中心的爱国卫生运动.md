I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I will make a speech about Shanghai's patriotic health campaign centered on "eliminating the four pests," which is unfolding vigorously.

    Shanghai's seven million people, on the basis of the great victory in the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification campaign, have mustered revolutionary vigor and are now advancing with a momentum of riding the wind and waves. On the one hand, they will accelerate catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom on the production front, and on the other hand, they will thoroughly eliminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails in the patriotic health campaign, turning Shanghai into a "seven-free" city that is both clean and beautiful.

    Shanghai, under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, had always been a place of filth and corruption, where the working people lived inhuman lives, and no one ever cared about their health. In the few years since liberation, the situation has changed greatly. After the patriotic health campaign centered on anti-bacterial warfare that began in 1952, and the mass "eliminate the four pests" struggle launched in 1956 due to the proposal of the Agricultural Development Program (Draft), Shanghai's sanitation work has been greatly promoted. A strong team of the patriotic health campaign has been formed among the masses, and the health of the people has been significantly improved. In terms of the incidence of various infectious diseases, compared with 1955, typhoid and paratyphoid fever decreased by 60 percent, malaria decreased by 19.2 percent, and Japanese encephalitis decreased by 4.5 percent in 1956. Compared with 1956, typhoid and paratyphoid fever decreased by another 10 percent, malaria decreased by another 52.7 percent, and Japanese encephalitis decreased by another 52.3 percent in 1957. Over 44,000 schistosomiasis patients were treated in two years, accounting for 64 percent of all patients. Two districts have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and the area where snails have been eliminated totals more than 4.4 million square meters.

    However, Shanghai has a very thick old foundation: many stinking ditches, many unclean industries, and a crowded and dense population. We have always had conservative ideas, grabbing at things when a campaign comes. We have not resolved the contradiction between combining the patriotic health campaign with the central tasks and combining the elimination of the four pests with production tasks in our work. Therefore, although the campaign has achieved remarkable results, it is uneven, infrequent, and not as effective as desired, so we must greatly increase our efforts.

    **Creating Miracles from Ordinary Things**
    **Let Shanghai's Old Foundation Undergo a Thorough Transformation**

    The high tide of the socialist revolution has come, and the enthusiasm of the masses has risen infinitely. The situation urgently requires a thorough transformation of Shanghai's old foundation. Chairman Mao's attention and concern for the patriotic health campaign, and the clear requirements of the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program for "eliminating the four pests" and eliminating various dangerous diseases, have given new impetus to the people of Shanghai. Since mid-December last year, a landslide-like patriotic health campaign has been fully launched. All organs, organizations, factories, shops, hospitals, schools, neighborhoods, streets, handicraft and agricultural production cooperatives have been mobilized. The urban area, the suburbs, the waterways, every household, men, women, old and young, are all mobilized, and everyone is taking action to encircle and suppress the "seven pests" from all directions. This is a revolutionary battle. We want to create miracles from ordinary things. For more than a month, the movement has expanded and deepened with wave after wave. I will now report on the main situation.

    **Leaders Taking the Lead, 4 Million People Joining the Battle**
    **Turning Shanghai into a Completely "Seven-Free" City in Five Years**

    Starting from December 19th last year, the leading comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee personally took the lead, and more than 1,000 cadres formed 100 shock teams, penetrating into 38 units in 17 districts to launch a "eliminate the four pests" shock action. These units included factories, schools, organs, agricultural production cooperatives, warehouses, neighborhoods, pastures, construction sites, vegetable markets, pig bristle bone workshops, feedlots, pickled vegetable bean sprout workshops, etc., which usually do not pay attention to sanitation work and have poor sanitation conditions. Some of them are key industries with many mosquitoes and flies. Municipal Party secretaries, vice mayors, and others personally worked with the masses to shovel manure, dig fly pupae, clear sewers, and remove garbage. This shock action greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. The leaders of various districts and units immediately took up the movement. The movement quickly unfolded like a surging tide. Within a few days, more than four million people in the city had joined the struggle.

    Leaders taking the lead and setting an example played a catalytic role. Leaders and the masses are closely integrated, which infinitely encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. This specifically embodies the revolutionary spirit that has been greatly promoted on the basis of the all-people rectification campaign. In the past, the masses waited for the leaders to formulate a plan before taking action. Now, they are acting, publicizing, and formulating plans at the same time, and the masses are directly participating in the formulation of plans. Some units originally planned to "eliminate the four pests" in ten or eight years. Now, according to the requirements of the masses, the plans have been revised again and again, shortening them to two years, three years, or even one year, or several months. The masses proposed to eliminate not only mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows, but also bedbugs and snails, and later added cockroaches, becoming "eliminate the seven pests." This combines the national "eliminate the four pests" campaign with the specific requirements of the region, further encouraging the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the masses. From the end of December to the beginning of January, in Comrade Ke Qingshi's report at the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress, and in Vice Mayor Liu Jiping's report at the Municipal People's Congress, "Advance by Riding the Wind and Waves, Launching a Larger-Scale Patriotic Health Campaign Centered on Eliminating the Four Pests," based on the development of the movement and the requirements of the masses themselves, the city's people were presented with a goal: to basically turn Shanghai into a city without "seven pests" in three years, and to turn Shanghai into a completely "seven-free" city in five years, and to adhere to the excellent tradition of "everyone talking about hygiene, every family loving cleanliness" until future generations!

    **More Than 300,000 Clean Units and Clean Households Appear**
    **Basically Eliminating the Seven Pests Can Be Greatly Advanced**

    This close combination from top to bottom and from bottom to top is promoting the movement to move forward with a vigorous momentum. On one Sunday, two million women in the city turned out to "eliminate the seven pests." Some neighborhood women were all mobilized, and generally more than 80 percent of the neighborhoods were mobilized. The masses launched a warm revolutionary competition to welcome the grand inspection and appraisal before the Spring Festival. At a mobilization meeting of 13,000 people on January 25, teams of workers, peasants, students, shop assistants, and peddlers reported preliminary results. Fudan University students carried air guns, shovels, and a large "Âõç" character composed of sparrows they had killed, reporting their achievements in capturing more than 1,147,000 pests in seven days, and promising to thoroughly eliminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, bark beetles, and tree borers in ten months, turning Fudan into an "eight-free" university to welcome this year's National Day. At the meeting, it was announced that Xuhui District had already seen 29 units that had basically eliminated the "seven pests." Beipingmin Village in Xuhui District and Fuxinli in Putuo District are both slum areas with very poor sanitary conditions, and they have achieved "seven-free" in a short period of time. All 25 vegetable markets in Putuo District have eliminated the "seven pests," and they have challenged the city's vegetable markets. These encouraging news further strengthened the fighting spirit of the masses. According to the requirements of the masses, the meeting adopted a resolution to create 1,000 or more "four-free" units and 100,000 or more "four-free" clean households among the city's organs, organizations, factories, shops, schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, collective dormitories, and suburban natural villages, including those created previously, before the Spring Festival.

    At present, the people of Shanghai are in a heatwave of socialist competition, comparing, learning, and catching up with the advanced in production, and also comparing, learning, and catching up with the advanced in the "eliminate the seven pests" struggle. The district committees of Yimiao, Penglai, and Zhabei Districts have signed a competition contract to make a great leap forward in rectification, "eliminate the seven pests," and handicrafts at the same time. They have all decided to eliminate the "seven pests" a year earlier. The target before the Spring Festival was quickly broken, and greatly broken. As of the 6th of this month, more than 3,100 clean units and 504,000 clean households have appeared in the city, exceeding the original target by three to four times. Shanghai does not need three years to basically eliminate the "seven pests," but can greatly advance the schedule.

    **Things That Were Originally Considered Impossible Must Be Done**
    **Hotels Eliminate Bedbugs, Fish Markets Have No Flies**

    Many facts prove that the power of the masses is infinite. Relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, things that were originally considered impossible can be done. Many units in the Shanghai Municipal Service Bureau system, such as aquatic products, catering, welfare, fruits, and vegetables, are most likely to attract and breed flies. It was previously believed that it was impossible for the aquatic products industry to eliminate flies and the hotel industry to eliminate bedbugs. The Service Bureau system originally set the time for eliminating the "four pests" at ten years, but after discussion by the masses, it has been revised again and again, and it has now been shortened to one and a half years. Some units have decided to achieve "seven-free" in one and a half years. The fish market of the Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, after the active efforts of the masses for two years, killed more than 300 jin of flies the year before last, and fished out more than 200 jin of maggots in the fish ponds, fish farms, and processing plants. Last year, they caught more than 130 jin of flies, and have basically eliminated flies. When the Japanese fisheries delegation visited, they also exclaimed: "It's great that there are no flies in the fish market!"

    **The Masses Think of Ways, the Government Supports**
    **Regulating Stinking Ditches, Eliminating Major Obstacles**

    There are hundreds of large and small stinking ditches and streams in Shanghai, with a total length of more than 225,000 meters, which is more than 200 kilometers. This is a major obstacle to cleanliness and hygiene. The problem is not simple and cannot be solved by simply filling them in. Now, the masses are racking their brains to find solutions. Some can be filled in, some need to be buried with pipes, some need to be dredged, and some need to be strengthened by mass management. By adopting a method of combining leaders and the masses, relying on the masses to take action, and unified leadership and management by the government, this problem can be gradually resolved.

    This campaign has had a profound influence on our entire society, and it is a profound socialist education for the broad masses. The Shanghai-based troops of the People's Liberation Army have thrown themselves into the "eliminate the seven pests" struggle in a combat posture, guaranteeing to help farmers in the suburbs eliminate snails. They disregard the severe winter wind and snow, and support farmers in digging mud to eliminate snails and building water conservancy projects. The soldiers' enthusiastic labor and revolutionary spirit have deeply moved the farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai, and their enthusiasm for production has been even higher. Many agricultural cooperatives have put forward the heroic slogan of completing the agricultural program indicators in three years, and the socialist competition heatwave of agricultural production has also been set off higher.

    The people of Shanghai are determined to fight a beautiful and great victory before the Spring Festival to lay the foundation for the victory of the "eliminate the seven pests" struggle. Combined with this struggle, they will also launch a greening campaign, improve environmental sanitation, formulate plans to eliminate various dangerous diseases, and strengthen scientific research and technical forces to consolidate the victory of the struggle. We are full of confidence that Shanghai will not only become a "seven-free" city in a few years, but also become a city with green trees, flowers, and fruits, a truly modern city that is clean, beautiful, and healthy, and completely suitable for the lives of the working people!
