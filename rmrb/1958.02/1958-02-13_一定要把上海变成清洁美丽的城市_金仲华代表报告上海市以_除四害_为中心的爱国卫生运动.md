I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I will make a speech about Shanghai's patriotic health campaign centered on "eliminating the four pests," which is unfolding vigorously.

    Shanghai's seven million people, on the basis of the great victory in the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification campaign, have mustered revolutionary vigor and are now advancing with a momentum of riding the wind and waves. On the one hand, they will accelerate catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom on the production front, and on the other hand, they will thoroughly eliminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and snails in the patriotic health campaign, turning Shanghai into a "seven-free" city that is both clean and beautiful.

    Shanghai, under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, had always been a place of filth and corruption, where the working people lived inhuman lives, and no one ever cared about their health. In the few years since liberation, the situation has changed greatly. After the patriotic health campaign centered on anti-bacterial warfare that began in 1952, and the mass "eliminate the four pests" struggle launched in 1956 due to the proposal of the Agricultural Development Program (Draft), Shanghai's sanitation work has been greatly promoted. A strong team of the patriotic health campaign has been formed among the masses, and the health of the people has been significantly improved. In terms of the incidence of various infectious diseases, compared with 1955, typhoid and paratyphoid fever decreased by 60 percent, malaria decreased by 19.2 percent, and Japanese encephalitis decreased by 4.5 percent in 1956. Compared with 1956, typhoid and paratyphoid fever decreased by another 10 percent, malaria decreased by another 52.7 percent, and Japanese encephalitis decreased by another 52.3 percent in 1957. Over 44,000 schistosomiasis patients were treated in two years, accounting for 64 percent of all patients. Two districts have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, and the area where snails have been eliminated totals more than 4.4 million square meters.

    However, Shanghai has a very thick old foundation: many stinking ditches, many unclean industries, and a crowded and dense population. We have always had conservative ideas, grabbing at things when a campaign comes. We have not resolved the contradiction between combining the patriotic health campaign with the central tasks and combining the elimination of the four pests with production tasks in our work. Therefore, although the campaign has achieved remarkable results, it is uneven, infrequent, and not as effective as desired, so we must greatly increase our efforts.

    **Creating Miracles from Ordinary Things**
    **Let Shanghai's Old Foundation Undergo a Thorough Transformation**

    The high tide of the socialist revolution has come, and the enthusiasm of the masses has risen infinitely. The situation urgently requires a thorough transformation of Shanghai's old foundation. Chairman Mao's attention and concern for the patriotic health campaign, and the clear requirements of the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program for "eliminating the four pests" and eliminating various dangerous diseases, have given new impetus to the people of Shanghai. Since mid-December last year, a landslide-like patriotic health campaign has been fully launched. All organs, organizations, factories, shops, hospitals, schools, neighborhoods, streets, handicraft and agricultural production cooperatives have been mobilized. The urban area, the suburbs, the waterways, every household, men, women, old and young, are all mobilized, and everyone is taking action to encircle and suppress the "seven pests" from all directions. This is a revolutionary battle. We want to create miracles from ordinary things. For more than a month, the movement has expanded and deepened with wave after wave. I will now report on the main situation.

    **Leaders Taking the Lead, 4 Million People Joining the Battle**
    **Turning Shanghai into a Completely "Seven-Free" City in Five Years**

    Starting from December 19th last year, the leading comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee personally took the lead, and more than 1,000 cadres formed 100 shock teams, penetrating into 38 units in 17 districts to launch a "eliminate the four pests" shock action. These units included factories, schools, organs, agricultural production cooperatives, warehouses, neighborhoods, pastures, construction sites, vegetable markets, pig bristle bone workshops, feedlots, pickled vegetable bean sprout workshops, etc., which usually do not pay attention to sanitation work and have poor sanitation conditions. Some of them are key industries with many mosquitoes and flies. Municipal Party secretaries, vice mayors, and others personally worked with the masses to shovel manure, dig fly pupae, clear sewers, and remove garbage. This shock action greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. The leaders of various districts and units immediately took up the movement. The movement quickly unfolded like a surging tide. Within a few days, more than four million people in the city had joined the struggle.

    Leaders taking the lead and setting an example played a catalytic role. Leaders and the masses are closely integrated, which infinitely encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. This specifically embodies the revolutionary spirit that has been greatly promoted on the basis of the all-people rectification campaign. In the past, the masses waited for the leaders to formulate a plan before taking action. Now, they are acting, publicizing, and formulating plans at the same time, and the masses are directly participating in the formulation of plans. Some units originally planned to "eliminate the four pests" in ten or eight years. Now, according to the requirements of the masses, the plans have been revised again and again, shortening them to two years, three years, or even one year, or several months. The masses proposed to eliminate not only mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows, but also bedbugs and snails, and later added cockroaches, becoming "eliminate the seven pests." This combines the national "eliminate the four pests" campaign with the specific requirements of the region, further encouraging the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the masses. From the end of December to the beginning of January, in Comrade Ke Qingshi's report at the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress, and in Vice Mayor Liu Jiping's report at the Municipal People's Congress, "Advance by Riding the Wind and Waves, Launching a Larger-Scale Patriotic Health Campaign Centered on Eliminating the Four Pests," based on the development of the movement and the requirements of the masses themselves, the city's people were presented with a goal: to basically turn Shanghai into a city without "seven pests" in three years, and to turn Shanghai into a completely "seven-free" city in five years, and to adhere to the excellent tradition of "everyone talking about hygiene, every family loving cleanliness" until future generations!

    **More Than 300,000 Clean Units and Clean Households Appear**
    **Basically Eliminating the Seven Pests Can Be Greatly Advanced**

    This close combination from top to bottom and from bottom to top is promoting the movement to move forward with a vigorous momentum. On one Sunday, two million women in the city turned out to "eliminate the seven pests." Some neighborhood women were all mobilized, and generally more than 80 percent of the neighborhoods were mobilized. The masses launched a warm revolutionary competition to welcome the grand inspection and appraisal before the Spring Festival. At a mobilization meeting of 13,000 people on January 25, teams of workers, peasants, students, shop assistants, and peddlers reported preliminary results. Fudan University students carried air guns, shovels, and a large "囍" character composed of sparrows they had killed, reporting their achievements in capturing more than 1,147,000 pests in seven days, and promising to thoroughly eliminate mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, bedbugs, cockroaches, bark beetles, and tree borers in ten months, turning Fudan into an "eight-free" university to welcome this year's National Day. At the meeting, it was announced that Xuhui District had already seen 29 units that had basically eliminated the "seven pests." Beipingmin Village in Xuhui District and Fuxinli in Putuo District are both slum areas with very poor sanitary conditions, and they have achieved "seven-free" in a short period of time. All 25 vegetable markets in Putuo District have eliminated the "seven pests," and they have challenged the city's vegetable markets. These encouraging news further strengthened the fighting spirit of the masses. According to the requirements of the masses, the meeting adopted a resolution to create 1,000 or more "four-free" units and 100,000 or more "four-free" clean households among the city's organs, organizations, factories, shops, schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, collective dormitories, and suburban natural villages, including those created previously, before the Spring Festival.

    At present, the people of Shanghai are in a heatwave of socialist competition, comparing, learning, and catching up with the advanced in production, and also comparing, learning, and catching up with the advanced in the "eliminate the seven pests" struggle. The district committees of Yimiao, Penglai, and Zhabei Districts have signed a competition contract to make a great leap forward in rectification, "eliminate the seven pests," and handicrafts at the same time. They have all decided to eliminate the "seven pests" a year earlier. The target before the Spring Festival was quickly broken, and greatly broken. As of the 6th of this month, more than 3,100 clean units and 504,000 clean households have appeared in the city, exceeding the original target by three to four times. Shanghai does not need three years to basically eliminate the "seven pests," but can greatly advance the schedule.

    **Things That Were Originally Considered Impossible Must Be Done**
    **Hotels Eliminate Bedbugs, Fish Markets Have No Flies**

    Many facts prove that the power of the masses is infinite. Relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, things that were originally considered impossible can be done. Many units in the Shanghai Municipal Service Bureau system, such as aquatic products, catering, welfare, fruits, and vegetables, are most likely to attract and breed flies. It was previously believed that it was impossible for the aquatic products industry to eliminate flies and the hotel industry to eliminate bedbugs. The Service Bureau system originally set the time for eliminating the "four pests" at ten years, but after discussion by the masses, it has been revised again and again, and it has now been shortened to one and a half years. Some units have decided to achieve "seven-free" in one and a half years. The fish market of the Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company, after the active efforts of the masses for two years, killed more than 300 jin of flies the year before last, and fished out more than 200 jin of maggots in the fish ponds, fish farms, and processing plants. Last year, they caught more than 130 jin of flies, and have basically eliminated flies. When the Japanese fisheries delegation visited, they also exclaimed: "It's great that there are no flies in the fish market!"

    **The Masses Think of Ways, the Government Supports**
    **Regulating Stinking Ditches, Eliminating Major Obstacles**

    There are hundreds of large and small stinking ditches and streams in Shanghai, with a total length of more than 225,000 meters, which is more than 200 kilometers. This is a major obstacle to cleanliness and hygiene. The problem is not simple and cannot be solved by simply filling them in. Now, the masses are racking their brains to find solutions. Some can be filled in, some need to be buried with pipes, some need to be dredged, and some need to be strengthened by mass management. By adopting a method of combining leaders and the masses, relying on the masses to take action, and unified leadership and management by the government, this problem can be gradually resolved.

    This campaign has had a profound influence on our entire society, and it is a profound socialist education for the broad masses. The Shanghai-based troops of the People's Liberation Army have thrown themselves into the "eliminate the seven pests" struggle in a combat posture, guaranteeing to help farmers in the suburbs eliminate snails. They disregard the severe winter wind and snow, and support farmers in digging mud to eliminate snails and building water conservancy projects. The soldiers' enthusiastic labor and revolutionary spirit have deeply moved the farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai, and their enthusiasm for production has been even higher. Many agricultural cooperatives have put forward the heroic slogan of completing the agricultural program indicators in three years, and the socialist competition heatwave of agricultural production has also been set off higher.

    The people of Shanghai are determined to fight a beautiful and great victory before the Spring Festival to lay the foundation for the victory of the "eliminate the seven pests" struggle. Combined with this struggle, they will also launch a greening campaign, improve environmental sanitation, formulate plans to eliminate various dangerous diseases, and strengthen scientific research and technical forces to consolidate the victory of the struggle. We are full of confidence that Shanghai will not only become a "seven-free" city in a few years, but also become a city with green trees, flowers, and fruits, a truly modern city that is clean, beautiful, and healthy, and completely suitable for the lives of the working people!

    一定要把上海变成清洁美丽的城市
    金仲华代表报告上海市以“除四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动
    我完全同意薄一波副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的各个报告。现在我就上海市正在轰轰烈烈展开的以“除四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动作一个发言。
    上海市七百万人民，在反右、整风取得伟大胜利的基础上，鼓起了革命干劲，目前正以乘风破浪之势前进，一方面要在生产战线上加速赶上和超过英国，同时要在爱国卫生运动中，彻底消灭蚊、蝇、鼠、雀、臭虫、蟑螂和钉螺，把上海变成既清洁又美丽的“七无”城市。
      上海这个城市，过去在帝国主义和国民党反动派统治下，一直是一个藏垢纳污之所，劳动人民过着非人的生活，他们的健康是从来没有人过问的。解放后几年来，情况有了很大变化。经过一九五二年开始的以反细菌战为中心的爱国卫生运动，一九五六年由于农业发展纲要草案的提出而展开的群众性“除四害”斗争，上海市的清洁卫生工作得到了很大的推动，群众中已形成了一支爱国卫生运动的强大队伍，人民健康情况有了显著的改进。以各种传染病的发病率来说，一九五六年和一九五五年相比，伤寒和副伤寒降低了百分之六十，疟疾降低了百分之十九点二，乙型脑炎降低了百分之四点五。一九五七年和一九五六年相比，伤寒和副伤寒又降低了百分之十，疟疾又降低了百分之五十二点七，乙型脑炎又降低了百分之五十二点三。血吸虫病患者两年间共治疗了四万四千多人，占全部病患者的百分之六十四，已有两个区基本上消灭了血吸虫病，消灭钉螺的面积共达四百四十多万平方公尺。
    但是，上海这个城市有它很厚的旧底子：臭水沟多，不清洁行业多，人口房屋拥挤密集。我们一向也有保守思想，运动来了抓一把，在工作中没有解决爱国卫生运动与中心任务不相结合、除四害与生产任务不相结合的矛盾。因此，运动虽然已取得显著成绩，但是开展得不平衡，不经常，效果不如理想，必须大大加一把力。
    从平凡事情中创造奇迹  让上海旧底子彻底翻身
    社会主义革命的高潮来了，群众的热潮无限高涨，形势迫切要求把上海的旧底子彻底翻个身。毛主席对于爱国卫生运动的重视和关怀，农业发展纲要修正草案对于“除四害”和消灭各种危险疾病的明确要求，给了上海人民以新的动力。从去年十二月中旬开始，一个排山倒海一样的爱国卫生运动全面展开了。所有机关、团体、工厂、商店、医院、学校、里弄、街道、手工业和农业生产合作社，都动了起来；市区、郊区、水上、家家户户、男女老幼，个个动员，人人动手，从四面八方围剿“七害”。这是一场革命性的战斗。我们要从平凡的事情中创造奇迹。一个多月来，运动以一个浪潮接着一个浪潮的声势，扩大深入展开。我现在把主要的情况汇报一下。
    领导带头突击四百万人投入战斗
    五年把上海变成彻底“七无”城市
    从去年十二月十九日开始，首先由中共上海市委和市人民委员会的领导同志亲自带头，和一千多个干部组成了一百个突击队，深入到十七个区的三十八个单位，展开“除四害”的突击行动。这些单位包括工厂、学校、机关、农业生产合作社、仓库、里弄、牧场、工地、菜场、猪毛骨作、饲养场、咸菜豆芽作等，都是平时不重视卫生工作，清洁卫生条件差，有的是多蚊蝇的重点行业。市委书记、副市长等亲自动手，和群众一道铲粪土，挖蝇蛹，通阴沟，除垃圾。这个突击行动把群众的热情大大鼓舞起来了。各个区、各单位的领导人也立即把运动抓起来了。运动很快像热潮汹涌地展开，几天内，全市已有四百多万人投入了斗争。
    领导带头，以身作则，起了促进剂的作用。领导和群众紧密结合在一起，把群众的革命干劲无限地鼓舞起来了。这具体体现了在全民整风基础上大大发扬起来的革命精神。以前，群众等待领导上订好了规划再行动；现在，是边行动、边宣传、边订规划，而且群众直接参加了制订规划。原来有些单位计划在十年、八年内“除四害”；现在，根据群众要求，一再修订计划，缩短到两年、三年，甚至一年，几个月。群众提出除了消灭蚊、蝇、鼠、雀之外，还要消灭臭虫和钉螺，后来又加上蟑螂，成为“除七害”。这样把全国性的“除四害”运动和地区性的具体要求结合在一起，更加鼓舞了群众的热情和斗志。从十二月底到一月初，在上海市党代表大会上柯庆施同志的报告中，和市人民代表大会上刘季平副市长所作“乘风破浪前进，掀起一个更大规模的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动”的报告中，根据运动发展的形势和群众自己的要求，向全市人民提出了一个奋斗目标，就是：在三年内把上海基本上变成一个没有“七害”的城市，五年内把上海变成一个彻底的“七无”城市，并且把“人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁”的优良传统，坚持下去，直到子孙万代！
    出现三十多万清洁单位清洁户  基本上消灭七害可以大大提早
    这样自上而下和自下而上紧密结合，推动着运动以热火朝天的气势奔腾前进。在一个星期日，全市有二百万妇女出动“除七害”，有的里弄妇女全部动起来了，一般里弄也达百分之八十以上。群众展开了热烈的革命竞赛，来迎接春节前的大检查、大评比。一月二十五日举行的一个一万三千人的动员大会上，一队队工人、农民、学生、店员、摊贩汇报初步战果。复旦大学学生掮着汽枪、锨和用他们打死的麻雀组成的一个大“囍”字，报告他们在七天内捕捉了一百一十四万七千多只害虫的成绩，并保证要在十个月内彻底消灭蚊、蝇、鼠、雀、臭虫、蟑螂、树皮虫、树蠹虫，把复旦变成“八无”大学，来迎接今年的国庆节。会上宣布，徐汇区已经出现了二十九个基本上消灭“七害”的单位。徐汇区的北平民村和普陀区的福新里，都是卫生条件极坏的棚户区，在短短时间内已经做到了“七无”。普陀区二十五个菜场全部消灭了“七害”，它们向全市菜场提出挑战。这些振奋人心的消息，进一步加强了群众的斗志。大会根据群众要求，通过一个决心书，要在春节以前，在全市机关、团体、工厂、商店、学校、医院、里弄、集体宿舍和郊区自然村中，连前共创造出一千个“四无”以上的单位，在全市居民户、商业户、手工业户中，连前共创造出十万个“四无”以上的清洁户。
    目前，上海人民正在一片社会主义竞赛的热潮中，在生产上比先进、学先进、赶先进，在“除七害”斗争中也比先进、学先进、赶先进。邑庙、蓬莱、闸北三个区的区委机关订了竞赛合同，要在整风、“除七害”、手工业三方面同时大跃进，它们都决定提早在一年内消灭“七害”。春节前的指标，很快被突破，而且大大被突破了。到本月六日止，全市已出现三千一百多个清洁单位，五十万零四千个清洁户，超过原定指标三到四倍以上。上海市基本上消灭“七害”，已经不需要三年，而可以大大提早了。
    原认为不能做的事都要做到  旅馆消灭臭虫鱼市场没苍蝇
    许多事实证明，群众的力量是无穷无尽的。依靠群众的积极性和创造性，原来认为做不到的事情都能做到了。上海市服务局系统的许多单位，像水产、饮食、福利、果品、蔬菜等行业，最容易吸引和孳生苍蝇，以前认为水产业要消灭苍蝇，旅馆业要消灭臭虫，是不可能的。服务局系统原订消灭“四害”的时间是十年，但是经过群众讨论，一再加以修订，现在已缩短到一年半，有的单位决定在一年半载内就做到“七无”。水产供销公司的鱼市场，两年来经过群众的积极努力，前年共打了三百多斤苍蝇，在鱼池、鱼场和加工场内捞起二百多斤蛆，去年又捉了一百三十多斤苍蝇，已经基本上消灭苍蝇。日本渔业代表团人员去参观时，也惊叹地说：“鱼市场上没有苍蝇，真伟大！”
    群众想办法　政府来支持  整治臭水沟　消除大障碍
    上海全市有大小臭水沟浜几百条，合起来全长二十二万五千多公尺，也就是二百多公里，这是清洁卫生的一个大障碍。问题并不简单，不能靠填没就算了事。现在，群众都在动脑筋，想办法。有的可以填没，有的要埋管，有的要疏通，有的要靠群众加强管理。采取领导和群众相结合的办法，依靠群众动手，由政府统一领导治理，可以把这个问题逐步解决的。
    这次运动对我们整个社会起了移风易俗的影响，对广大群众是一次深刻的社会主义教育。解放军驻沪部队以作战姿态投入“除七害”斗争，保证帮助郊区农民消灭钉螺；他们不顾严冬风雪，支援农民挖泥灭螺，兴修水利。战士们火热的劳动和革命精神，使上海郊区农民深深受到感动，生产积极性更为高涨，不少农业合作社提出了三年完成农业纲要指标的豪迈口号，农业生产的社会主义竞赛热潮也掀得更高了。
    上海人民决心在春节前打一个漂亮的大胜仗，来奠定“除七害”斗争的胜利基础。结合着这个斗争，还要展开绿化运动，改进环境卫生，制订消灭各种危险疾病的规划，加强科学研究和技术力量，来巩固斗争胜利的成果。我们满怀信心，要使上海在几年内不仅变成一个“七无”城市，而且要变成一个绿树成荫、花果满枝的城市，一个既清洁、又美丽、又健康的完全适合于劳动人民生活的真正现代化城市！
