Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 17th: On the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site just before the Spring Festival, the builders launched a race to win time.

According to the instructions of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation recently decided to complete the No. 1 Blast Furnace system project and put it into production one quarter ahead of schedule, on October 1st this year. This decision has now been transformed into practical action by tens of thousands of builders, who boldly proposed: "Work hard for 7 months to ensure the blast furnace produces iron," and "Get ahead of time."

According to the original plan, the 140 pillars of the stock bin trestle were to be hoisted by the end of the month, but the members of Liu Fuyou's composite work team worked hard and completed it before the Spring Festival. Some young workers in Guo Jixian's composite work team postponed their weddings to complete the concrete pouring of the blast furnace dust collector one day before the Spring Festival.

Based on the proposal of thousands of builders on the construction site to "break the routine and celebrate the Spring Festival," Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has decided to shorten the three-day Spring Festival holiday to two days. However, some builders at the No. 1 Blast Furnace and No. 1 Coke Oven construction sites voluntarily shortened the two-day holiday to one day, and went to work as usual on the 17th. The famous Jiang Xinhe hoisting team, Zhu Shouju riveting team, and welding and oxygen cutting workers arrived at the No. 1 Blast Furnace construction site earlier than usual on the 17th. They directed the 40-ton tower crane to hoist the orange-red blast furnace top platform steel frame to the 40-meter-high furnace top. Prior to this, the builders had already installed three majestic hot blast stoves side by side to a height of more than 40 meters; the huge No. 1 blast furnace was only waiting for the final three rings of the furnace shell to be hoisted.

At the No. 1 Coke Oven construction site, the furnace builders of the 17th day shift walked from their dormitories nearly ten miles away to the construction site before dawn. Before they went to work, the night shift workers had already transported 180 tons of refractory bricks for them overnight, exceeding the national quota by 70%. A person in charge of the construction site told the Xinhua News Agency reporter with a radiant expression: "Resting one day less will allow the coke oven to produce coke one day earlier. We have decided to shorten the planned 90-day furnace construction time to 65 days."

### 春节不休息　高炉早出铁  武钢工地职工和时间赛跑

    春节不休息　高炉早出铁
    武钢工地职工和时间赛跑
    新华社武汉17日电　春节前夕的武钢工地上，建设者们展开了一场赢得时间的赛跑。
    根据冶金工业部的指示，武汉钢铁公司最近决定把一号高炉系统的工程，提前一个季度在今年10月1日建成和投入生产。这个决定现在变成了数万名建设者的实际行动，他们豪迈地提出：“苦战7月，保证高炉出铁”，“赶在时间前面”。
    按照原订计划，料仓栈桥的一百四十根柱子要到月底才能吊装完毕，但是刘福有混合工作队的队员们鼓足了干劲，在春节前就已提前完成。郭继先混合工作队有些青年工人推迟了自己的婚期，赶着在春节前一天完成了高炉除尘器的混凝土浇灌工程。
    根据工地千百名建设者提出的“打破常规过春节”的倡议，武钢公司已经决定把春节的三天假期缩短为两天。但是，一号高炉和一号焦炉工地的一部分建设者，又把两天假期自动缩短为一天，17日照常出勤。著名的江新河吊装工小组、朱寿菊铆工小组和电焊、氧割工人们，17日比平常提前来到一号高炉工地。他们指挥着起重四十吨的塔式起重机，把橙红色的高炉炉顶平台钢架，吊上了四十公尺高的炉顶。在此以前，建设者们已经把三座巍峨的热风炉并排安装到四十多公尺的标高；巨大的一号高炉也只等吊装最后的三圈炉壳了。
    一号炼焦炉工地上，17日日班的筑炉工人们黎明前就从近十里外的宿舍步行赶到工地。在他们上班前，夜班工人早已以超过国家定额70％的纪录，连夜为他们搬运好了一百八十吨耐火砖。一位工地负责人神情焕发地对新华社记者说：“少休息一天，就能让焦炉早一天出焦炭。我们已经决定把计划九十天的砌炉时间缩短到六十五天。”
