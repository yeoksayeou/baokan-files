    Four Explorations of Dushan Mountain
    On the 11th, the Hebei Daily published an editorial, accompanied by news reports, focusing on the new tasks that the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has brought to commercial work. The editorial focused on discussing how socialist commerce should promote industrial and agricultural production, and gave a vivid example: The Liangjiatai Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Qinglong County, in order to promote agricultural production, tirelessly "explored Dushan Mountain four times," searching for timber, medicinal materials, and other resources. After finding production opportunities, they traveled everywhere to open up sales channels for the products, while also buying back urgently needed production tools for the masses, and then organizing the masses to start mountain production. In four months, the Liangjiatai Township farmers increased their income by more than 94,000 yuan, and the sales volume of the supply and marketing cooperative also increased four times compared to the past.

    四探都山
    11日河北日报发表社论，并配合新闻集中地报道了工农业生产大跃进给商业工作带来的新任务。社论中着重论述了社会主义的商业应如何促进工、农业生产，并举出了一个生动的例子：青龙县亮甲台供销社，为促进农业生产，不辞辛苦“四探都山”，寻找木材、药材及其他资源。找到生产门路后，又四出奔走，为产品打开了销路，同时给群众买回急需的生产用具，然后又组织群众开山生产。四个月使亮甲台全乡农民增加九万四千多元收入，供销社的销货额也比过去增加了四倍。
