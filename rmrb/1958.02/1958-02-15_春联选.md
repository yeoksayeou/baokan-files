Spring Couplets Selection

　　May everything go as you wish every year; may the motherland be as you wish, and I be as you wish.
　　May you have peace at every step; may the world be peaceful, and the home be peaceful.
　　Replacing the old year with new enthusiasm, let us leap forward together on the Long March.
　　Welcoming spring and embracing happiness, the Five-Year Plan is coming again.
         (Cai Shengshuo)

    春联选
    年年如意，祖国如意我如意
    步步平安，世界平安家平安
    换岁添热情，万里长征同跃进
    迎春接幸福，五年计划又来临
         （蔡声硕）
