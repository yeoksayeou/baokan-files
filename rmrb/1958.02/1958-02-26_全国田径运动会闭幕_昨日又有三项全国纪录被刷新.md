Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th. The 1958 National Spring Track and Field Games concluded in Guangzhou this morning. In the final day of competition, five athletes broke three national records.

During the four-day competition, the Chinese People's Liberation Army track and field team and the Chengdu track and field team won the first place in the men's and women's team total scores respectively. The second place in the men's and women's team total scores were won by the Beijing team and the Shanghai team, respectively.

Today, the top three athletes in the men's 10km race walk final broke the national record of 52 minutes 11.6 seconds held by Guan Shaoying. Wang Dequi from Shenyang and Yang Shengxiu from Xi'an competed fiercely, and the two were only a few meters apart when they reached the finish line. As a result, Wang Dequi reached the finish line first with a time of 51 minutes 40.2 seconds. Yang Shengxiu's score was 51 minutes 44.6 seconds. The third place was Qiao Chengming from Shenyang, with a score of 52 minutes 6.8 seconds.

Li Menglin, a PLA athlete who broke the national record in the men's pentathlon on the 23rd, broke the national record in the men's grenade throw today. His score was 71 meters 27 centimeters, exceeding the national record of 70 meters 44 centimeters created by Huang Shijie in 1956.

Xian Shaomei from Tianjin pushed the shot put to a distance of 13 meters 62 centimeters in the women's shot put final, which was 12 centimeters further than the national record held by Shi Baozhu. Shi Baozhu won second place today with a score of 12 meters 57 centimeters.

The women's long jump final held today aroused great interest among the audience. Liu Xingyu from Chengdu, after creating a new national score of 5 meters 55 centimeters in the long jump competition of the pentathlon on the 24th, created an even better score of 5 meters 59 centimeters today. However, because the wind speed exceeded the standard of 2 meters per second when Liu Xingyu was long jumping, her score will not be listed as an official national record.

    全国田径运动会闭幕
    昨日又有三项全国纪录被刷新
    新华社广州25日电　1958年全国春季田径运动会今天上午在广州结束。在最后一天的比赛中，又有五名运动员打破了三项全国纪录。
    在为时四天的比赛中，中国人民解放军田径队和成都田径队分别获得了男女团体总分第一名。男女团体总分的第二名分别被北京队和上海队夺得。
    今天，参加男子十公里竞走决赛获得前三名的运动员都打破了关绍英保持的五十二分十一秒六的全国纪录。沈阳选手王德奎和西安选手杨省修竞争得十分激烈，到达终点时两人相距只有几公尺，结果王德奎以五十一分四十秒二的时间首先到达终点。杨省修的成绩是五十一分四十四秒六。第三名是沈阳选手乔成明，成绩五十二分六秒八。
    在23日打破了男子五项运动全国纪录的解放军选手李孟林，今天又刷新了男子手榴弹掷远的全国纪录。他的成绩是七十一公尺二十七公分，超过了黄世杰在1956年创造的七十公尺四十四公分的全国纪录。
    天津市选手冼少梅在女子铅球决赛中，把铅球推到十三公尺六十二公分的距离，比石宝珠保持的全国纪录还远十二公分。石宝珠今天得第二名，成绩是十二公尺五十七公分。
    今天举行的女子跳远决赛引起了观众极大兴趣，成都市选手刘兴玉继24日在五项运动的跳远比赛中创造了五公尺五十五公分的全国新成绩后，今天又创造了五公尺五十九公分的更好成绩。但是因为刘兴玉跳远时风速超过了每秒钟两公尺的标准，她的成绩将不能被列为正式全国纪录。
