　　Guarantee to Surpass the United States in Livestock Product Output in the Short Term
    Soviet Veterinary Work Continues to Achieve New Successes
    (Our dispatch) With the development of Soviet animal husbandry, and with the task of catching up with the United States in meat, milk, and oil production per capita in the next few years being put forward, the Soviet Union is constantly achieving great success in veterinary work.
    During the Soviet era, the number of Soviet veterinary technicians has greatly increased. Before the revolution, there were only 4,142 veterinarians and 6,828 veterinary assistants, while currently there are 42,140 veterinarians and more than 49,000 veterinary assistants. There are 33 veterinary colleges and departments, 34 animal husbandry departments, 135 secondary veterinary and animal husbandry vocational schools, and a large number of one-year animal husbandry and veterinary schools that train veterinary personnel. In terms of veterinary institutions, in 1917 there were only more than 2,500 veterinary work sections and 3,000 veterinary assistant stations, while now there are more than 36,000 veterinary institutions distributed throughout the country in the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture system alone. In addition, there are 1,700 veterinarians and veterinary assistants working in collective farms, state farms, and stud farms.
    Before the revolution, each veterinarian was responsible for 20,000 to 50,000 head of livestock. In some border areas, they were even responsible for about 100,000 head. Now, on average, each veterinarian is responsible for no more than 8,000 head.
    In terms of the production of veterinary biological products, the Soviet Union has 24 biological product joint factories and biological product manufacturing plants, producing a total of 80 kinds of vaccines, serums, and diagnostic fluids.
    Soviet veterinary scientific work has also greatly developed, and many well-known domestic and foreign microbiologists, virologists, and animal epidemiologists have grown up. They have studied the new veterinary science regarding the influence of microorganisms and the external environment on the occurrence, development, and demise of infectious processes, as well as the causes and routes of infection, and have successfully developed dozens of effective vaccines, serums, and diagnostic fluids. Soviet veterinary scientists have successfully applied tracer atoms to study the pathways of various organic substances synthesizing microorganisms. In recent years, electron microscopes have been widely used in the study of viral morphology, and new understandings have been gained on some new issues. In the study of parasitic worms, Academician Skryabin, Deputy Director of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, founded a new science—helminthology—established a scientific research institution for helminthic diseases, trained more than 1,000 senior technical cadres, and developed new methods for treating and preventing helminthic diseases. Currently, there are more than 300 helminthological survey teams in the Soviet Union, which have basically clarified the parasitic systems of domestic animals, wild animals, poultry, fish, rodents, etc., and have also discovered more than 500 kinds of parasitic worms. In addition, there have been great achievements in the research of non-infectious diseases of agriculture and animal husbandry and the application of antibiotics to reduce livestock morbidity and mortality losses and stimulate the growth of young livestock. For example, a state farm in the Moscow region, by adding trace amounts of antibiotics to the feed of young chickens (1 to 2 grams per ton of feed), raised an additional 6,500 chickens in a year. Feeding piglets in this way can also increase their weight.
    In order to guarantee that livestock product output per capita catches up with the United States in the next few years, Soviet veterinary workers are using various methods to tap potential, strive to greatly reduce the morbidity and mortality of livestock, better organize the masses to take livestock prevention measures, eliminate livestock non-pregnancy, carry out artificial insemination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and strengthen the protection of young livestock.

　　保证在畜产品产量方面短期超过美国
    苏联兽医工作不断获得新成就
    本报讯　随着苏联畜牧业的发展，随着争取在最近几年内在按人口计算的肉类、奶类和油脂的产量方面赶上美国的任务的提出，苏联在兽医工作方面不断取得很大成就。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，苏联的兽医技术人员的数量有很大增加。在革命以前，只有兽医四千一百四十二人和兽医助手六千八百二十八人，而目前则有兽医四万二千一百四十人和兽医助手四万九千多人。培养兽医人员的学校计有兽医高等院校和系三十三个，畜牧系三十四个，兽医和畜牧中等专业学校一百三十五所以及大量的一年制畜牧兽医学校。在兽医机构方面，1917年仅有二千五百多个兽医工作段和三千个兽医助手工作站，而现在仅苏联农业部系统分布在全国的兽医机构就有三万六千多个，另外还有一千七百名兽医和兽医助手在集体农庄、国营农场和种畜场工作。
    在革命前，每一个兽医负担牲畜头数为两万到五万头，在一些边疆地区，甚至要负担约十万头。而现在平均每个兽医担负数量不超过八千头。
    在兽医生物药品的生产方面，苏联有二十四个生物药品联合工厂和生物药品制造厂，计生产八十种疫苗、血清和诊断液。
    苏联的兽医科学工作也有很大发展，很多国内外著名的微生物学家、病毒学家和动物流行病学家成长起来了。他们研究了新的兽医科学关于微生物和外界环境传染过程中的发生、发展和消亡的影响，以及传染原因和传染途径等问题，并且研究成功几十种有效的疫苗、血清和诊断液。苏联兽医科学工作者成功地应用了示踪原子研究各种有机物质合成微生物的途径。近年来在研究病毒形态学方面广泛地应用了电子显微镜，对于一些新的问题有了了解。在研究寄生蠕虫方面，全苏列宁农业科学院副院长斯科良宾院士创立了一门新的科学——寄生蠕虫学，建立了寄生蠕虫病科学研究机构，培养了一千多名高级技术干部，并研究出治疗和预防寄生蠕虫病的新方法。现在，苏联有三百多个寄生蠕虫调查队，已经基本上弄清楚了家畜、野兽、禽类、鱼类、齧齿动物等的寄生虫系，同时还发现了五百多种寄生蠕虫。此外，在农畜非传染病方面的研究和应用抗生素以减少牲畜发病和死亡损失并刺激幼畜生长等方面也有很大的成就。例如，莫斯科州的一个国营农场，由于在幼鸡饲料中搀进微量抗生素（每吨饲料中用一至二克），一年中多养活了六千五百只鸡，用这种方法饲养小猪，也能增加体重。
    为了保证在最近几年来在按人口计算的畜产品产量方面赶上美国，苏联的兽医工作人员正在用各种方法挖掘潜力，争取大大降低牲畜的发病率和死亡率，更好地组织群众进行牲畜预防措施，消灭农畜空怀，开展农畜人工授精和加强保护幼畜工作。（附图片）
