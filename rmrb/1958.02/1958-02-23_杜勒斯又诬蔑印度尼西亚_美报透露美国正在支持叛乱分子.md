Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, Washington Dispatch: US Secretary of State Dulles said on the 21st at the swearing-in ceremony of the new US Ambassador to Indonesia, Howard Jones, that the United States is "very concerned" about the future of the Republic of Indonesia.

In his speech, Dulles did not conceal his dissatisfaction with the Indonesian government. He said that "maintaining the kind of relationship that the United States desires between the United States and Indonesia has many problems" because "Indonesia is a difficult place to deal with." He threatened that "the Republic of Indonesia was established, at least in part, because the United States believed that this republic should be established." He believes that the Indonesian government seems to "need to make tremendous efforts and have statesmanship to realize the hopes and aspirations of its people."

Dulles' remarks were essentially a restatement of his remarks at a press conference on February 11. Dulles blatantly expressed his intention to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs at that time, maliciously attacking the Indonesian government and expressing sympathy for the Indonesian rebels who were attempting to overthrow the government.

According to State Department spokesman White, Jones is scheduled to depart for Indonesia in a hurry twenty-four hours after taking office. White said that the situation in Indonesia is "extremely unstable," and this situation "is certainly the reason why the US government wants Jones to get there as soon as possible."

A commentary in the "Washington Post" on the 17th stated that providing aid and encouragement to Indonesian rebels is the policy that Washington is currently pursuing. The newspaper pointed out, "It is clear that Washington has decided to provide real support to the Indonesian rebel leaders who are trying to bring down President Sukarno's central government." Dulles's remarks at the press conference on the 11th were not a "slip of the tongue," but were "deliberately giving the rebels the necessary encouragement" and showing the Jakarta government that the United States is very dissatisfied with its political trends.

### 杜勒斯又诬蔑印度尼西亚  美报透露美国正在支持叛乱分子

    杜勒斯又诬蔑印度尼西亚
    美报透露美国正在支持叛乱分子
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯21日在美国新任驻印度尼西亚大使霍华德·琼斯的宣誓就职典礼上说，美国“非常关心”印度尼西亚共和国的前途。
    杜勒斯在讲话中并不掩饰他对印度尼西亚政府的不满。他说，“要在美国和印度尼西亚之间维持美国所希望的那种关系带有许多问题”，因为“印度尼西亚是一个很难对付的地方”。他威胁说，“印度尼西亚共和国得以成立，至少一部分原因是因为美国认为应该成立这个共和国”。他认为印度尼西亚政府似乎“需要作巨大的努力和具有政治家风度才能实现它的人民的希望和愿望”。
    杜勒斯这些话实际上是他2月11日在记者招待会上的发言的重申。杜勒斯当时曾经露骨地表示要干涉印度尼西亚内政，他恶意地攻击印度尼西亚政府，并且对企图推翻政府的印度尼西亚叛乱分子表示同情。
    据国务院发言人怀特说，琼斯在就任二十四小时后就要匆匆出发前往印度尼西亚。怀特说，印度尼西亚局势“极不固定”，这种局势“肯定是美国政府希望琼斯尽快到那里去”的原因。
    “华盛顿邮报”17日的评论说，对印度尼西亚叛乱分子给以援助和鼓励是华盛顿目前正在采取的方针。报纸指出，“很明显，华盛顿已经决定要对企图搞垮苏加诺总统中央政府的印度尼西亚叛军领袖们提供真正的支持。”杜勒斯11日在记者招待会上的发言并不是“失言”，这是“故意给予叛军以必要的鼓励”，并且向雅加达政府表明，美国非常不满意它的政治趋势。
