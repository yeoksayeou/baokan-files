    New Look of Jushan Mountain
    After learning from the experience of water and soil conservation in Daquan Mountain, Yu County, Henan Province, conducted pilot projects in multiple locations based on the specific conditions of the region. In November of last year, the county's water conservancy work conference decided to complete the task of controlling barren hills, originally planned for five years, within one year. Now, a mass movement to control barren hills has been vigorously launched. This is the appearance of Jushan Mountain in Xuegou Township of the county after being treated. The characteristic of this type of project is to organize diverse small-scale projects into a complete system. For example, below fish-scale pits, there are contour ditches or interception ditches; inside the ravines, there are terraced check dams; below the check dams, there are buffer ponds; the buffer ponds have spillways, and below them, there are sediment settling ponds and storage ponds. Therefore, it can achieve interception at every stage and gradual release in sequence.

    鸠山新面貌
    河南禹县学习了大泉山水土保持的经验后，就根据本地区的情况进行了多点试办。去年11月该县水利工作会议决定把五年治好荒山的任务改在一年内全部完成。现在群众性治理荒山的运动已经热烈开展起来。这是该县薛沟乡鸠山治理后的面貌。这种工程的特点是把多种多样的小型工程组织起来，形成一个完整的体系。如在鱼鳞坑下面有水平沟或截水沟，山沟里面层层修谷坊，谷坊下面有缓冲池，缓冲池有溢洪道，下面还有澄沙池和蓄水塘，因而能够做到节节拦蓄，顺序下放。
