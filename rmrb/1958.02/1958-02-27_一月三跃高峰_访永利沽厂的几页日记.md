A Month of Three Leaps to the Peak
    ——A Few Pages of Diary from a Visit to the Yongli Alkali Plant in Tanggu
    By our reporter, Yin Chongjing

    January 18th
    Catch up with "Brunner Mond", surpass "Brunner Mond"

    The sky cleared after the snow, and the weather was very cold. People putting up big-character posters for the production leap forward were wearing leather jackets and breathing on the backs of their hands.

    The whole factory was buzzing. On the "Leap Forward Corner" at the entrance of the trade union, a new advanced target was proposed, and another even newer target appeared next to it...

    Cold weather, but a burning heart—this was my first impression upon entering the factory.

    In the afternoon, I visited Comrade He Qingqi, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, and asked him a question: "What is your goal for the Great Leap Forward? Are all the workers in the factory clear about it?" Comrade He Qingqi immediately replied firmly: "Clear, everyone is clear—catch up with Brunner Mond, surpass Brunner Mond!" This old British "Brunner Mond & Co." had been the target of Yongli's struggle for two or three decades before China's liberation. At that time, this weak national industry of ours, due to high costs, low quality, and small output, finally failed in the struggle and had to sign an agreement with the British: formally allocate 45% of the sales volume of soda ash in the Chinese market to "Brunner Mond," while "Yongli" kept 55% for itself. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of the entire factory forged ahead courageously, and the situation fundamentally changed. Not only were they no longer bullied and attacked by imported goods in the domestic market, but also because the quality of our soda ash had surpassed "Brunner Mond," the reputation of Chinese soda ash was much higher than that of British soda ash in the markets of many Southeast Asian countries. However, our output was still much less than that of the British. Our workers knew that soda ash is the "mother of industry," and it is related to the production of more than 20 industries such as pig iron founding, petroleum refining, antimony smelting, paper making, glass, printing, and rayon. Therefore, they were determined to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and, together with other brother factories, catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of alkali production in fifteen years or a little more. Comrade He Qingqi said: "This is a peaceful competition, but it is also an arduous battle. We have decided that this battle will begin tonight."

    January 19th to 23rd
    Enthusiasm · Wisdom · Science · Experience

    On the 19th, the workers in the various workshops of the soda ash system officially entered the battle. Before zero hour, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, the factory director, the chairman of the trade union, and the dispatcher came to the workshop together to check the various preparations. It turned out that the workers had been discussing the leap forward plan and looking for ways to leap forward for more than ten days. They knew very well that the factory's production management was backward during the private period, and the production potential had not been fully utilized since the joint state-private ownership. Almost every tower, every pot, and every machine had great potential to be tapped. They conducted a week of meticulous scientific experiments, and finally, with the approval of the factory department, comprehensively improved the production efficiency of the equipment. The lime kiln and brine section increased the input of limestone and salt by more than one ton per hour, the flywheel of the carbonation machine was sped up by about ten revolutions per minute, and the carbonation tower injected four cubic meters more gas per minute. American engineers had stipulated a quota of 45 tons per day for each drying pot before liberation, which had gradually increased to 85 tons since liberation, and today it was raised again to more than 100 tons.

    At zero hour sharp, the first shift of workers today officially took over the shift. The factory director put forward two loud demands, or rather orders, to all the workers: first, stability, and second, safety. On the basis of stability and safety, boldly increase production and boldly leap forward.

    On the surface, the various workshops today looked exactly the same as usual: machines were running, instruments were rising and falling, and workers were operating quietly... However, today's production was very different from the past. The important work positions such as the ammonia distillation tower and the carbonation tower were led by veteran tower operators with one or two decades of experience, who, along with their assistants and university graduates undergoing labor training here, constantly patrolled the dozens of large towers on the nine-story building to absolutely ensure that production was normal every minute.

    In the past, the workers in the various workshops did not cooperate very well, and they often blamed and shirked each other when production problems arose. Today, the telephone bells in the various workshops and sections kept ringing, and the workers took the initiative to contact each other to ask questions. The workers in the power workshop, which was related to the lifeline of production, proposed and resolutely achieved "to have gas when needed, water when needed, and electricity when needed."

    The revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers was fully manifested in the exertion of wisdom and experience, and also in the high degree of cooperative spirit; the intensity of physical labor did not seem to have increased much. Only the packaging workers in the final stage of the process appeared very tense and busy. Because the output of soda ash had greatly increased, they could not keep up with the bagging, weighing, and transportation, and were almost running with carts weighing eighty kilograms. Everyone was covered in sweat, and they had no time to wipe off the alkali powder that had formed like frost on their eyebrows and eyelashes.

    Twenty-four hours later, the victorious news came from the packaging workers: today's soda ash production had created the highest record in the 41 years since the establishment of the Yongli factory, an increase of 26% compared with the average daily output last year.

    Having won the first victory, the workers continued their efforts and, ninety-six hours later, won the second victory: the daily output of soda ash increased by another 8% compared to the 19th.

    The workers were still not satisfied. They wanted to ride the waves, overcome the imbalances in the production equipment and all the newly exposed weak links brought about by the increase in the daily output of soda ash, and lead the leap forward to the third peak.

    January 26th
    Two Thrilling Battles

    Today is Sunday, and according to the plan of the Electricity Bureau, the entire factory happened to be without power. The workers seized the opportunity! In these twenty-four hours, the entire factory carried out two thrilling and moving battles.

    The rear wall of the furnace chamber of the No. 11 and No. 12 large boilers in the power workshop cracked with large seams and had to be repaired while the opportunity presented itself. After the power was cut off and the fire was extinguished, workers would normally have to wait 48 hours before they could enter the chamber to work. Today, the workers were unwilling to follow the usual practice. They decided to take the most meticulous protective measures and enter the furnace to work ahead of schedule. They waited for seven hours, and when the furnace temperature was still 140 degrees, veteran worker Zhang Wenyuan, who had more than 20 years of experience, and young worker Li Boyi put on heat-resistant work clothes, protective masks, and tightly tied the cuffs, trouser legs, and the joints of gloves and socks with ropes. They picked up a piece of wood soaked in water and inserted it through the furnace door. The two gritted their teeth, clenched their fists, and jumped into the No. 11 large furnace chamber like "Laojun's furnace" or "Flaming Mountain." Their companions outside immediately handed in a bucket of refractory soil, and the two held their breath, stood firm in the furnace, and used their hands to quickly grab the soil to repair the cracks. After a total of six minutes, the task was accomplished. The two jumped out of the furnace, their faces flushed, and their breathing was obviously a little difficult. Their companions pulled out the wooden plank, which was already covered in scars and gently emitting smoke. However, now was not the time to rest. Zhang Wenyuan and another worker, Li Changrong, jumped into the adjacent No. 12 large furnace and carried out the same heroic labor again.

    Another battle was fought in the No. 2 ammonia distillation tower, which was thirteen zhang (approximately 43 meters) high. Because it had not been cleaned for a long time, the gaps in the equipment inside the tower were almost blocked by slag. Today, the factory's Communist Youth League Committee organized a youth commando team of more than 300 people to carry out a thorough cleaning. Cleaning this tower was no easy task. There were 30,000 to 40,000 small porcelain cans inside the tower, similar in size to canned food cans, which had to be disassembled one by one, the layer of hard scars attached to the cans had to be shoveled off, and then they had to be installed one by one. Such work would normally take eight and a half days, but this time it did not take a minute longer than the one day of power outage. In the early morning, the commander-in-chief of the commando team announced the start of the operation. As soon as the small door of the ninth floor of the tower opened, a strong smell of ammonia gas rushed towards them, causing the people near the tower door to itch and want to cry. Everyone was stunned. Someone shouted, "What are you waiting for? Why don't you go in!" Communist Youth League members Zhang Shihai and two others threw off their cotton-padded jackets, covered their mouths with towels, and plunged into the tower. The tower was dark, with blue sparks flashing everywhere. The young people inside endured the very irritating smell, and disassembled the porcelain cans one by one and handed them out. More than twenty minutes passed, and if they didn't come out, they would faint. The secretary of the Youth League Committee, who was already choking uncomfortably standing outside the tower door, shouted anxiously: "Come out quickly." But the answer from inside was: "We won't leave the front line until the task is completed." The secretary of the Youth League Committee shouted loudly again: "This is an order, you have to come out, let others replace you!" The young people inside were still unwilling to come out. Finally, when they reached out to hand out the porcelain cans, they were pulled out one by one. Before they could be redistributed, two people who had been waiting nearby had already plunged in.

    February 4th to 6th
    Revolutionary Friendship and Great Collaboration

    Entering February, a serious weak link was exposed. Due to the dry tide in the Bohai Sea, the pumping station by the sea could not draw water, and the water level of the reservoir in the factory gradually dropped from two chi (approximately 67 cm) to four cun (approximately 13 cm), which was only enough for two or three days. At the same time, alkali production requires low-temperature water, the more heat it absorbs, the higher the conversion rate of salt to alkali. But now there was no new seawater, and they could only rely on the circulating water after production in the factory, so the water temperature was gradually increasing, and the output of soda ash decreased significantly. The entire factory was in a "water shortage" amidst the shouts of the Great Leap Forward. The factory Party Committee immediately reported the situation to the Tanggu District Committee of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Wang Changqun, the deputy secretary of the District Committee, immediately convened an emergency meeting of the heads of relevant departments such as the Salt Affairs Bureau, the Electricity Bureau, and the Dredging Company to study how to fully support the alkali plant's Great Leap Forward. The solution was to drive the electric dredger "Tanggu No. 9" of the Dredging Company to the sea, pump the water, pass it through the mud discharge pipe, flow through the twenty-li (approximately 10 km) salt flats, and finally transport it to the alkali plant's reservoir.

    Saying this was not simple, but doing it was even more difficult. The "Tanggu No. 9" dredger that needed to be used had already entered the harbor for shelter last winter, and was now frozen to the continent, unable to be moved. How could it be driven to the sea to pump water? This difficulty alarmed the workers of the "Kailing" icebreaker of the Port Authority. They said heroically, "We'll go and break it open." On the morning of February 4th, as the red sun just rose from the sea, the "Kailing" broke into the side of the "Tanggu No. 9" which was hibernating, and completely shattered the three thousand cubic meters of thick ice around it.

    The mud conveying pipeline was different from the water diversion ditch, and there was a six-hundred-meter flat land in the middle. In order to solve this problem, the civil engineering team of the alkali plant and many departments, as well as outside units, sent more than 400 employees who volunteered to go to the seaside to dig a water diversion ditch. On the morning of the 5th, the seawater came. However, as soon as the seawater flowed into the original dilapidated salt ditch, it "whooshed" and washed away the embankment. The joyful crowd suddenly panicked. At this time, Gu Shiyun, a cadre sent to the lower levels and a Communist Party member, gave a call, and many employees jumped into the gap without hesitation. Facing the bitter sea breeze, they stood leg to leg in the icy water, blocking its escape route, and let other employees quickly repair the gap.

    On the evening of the 6th, when the circulating water in the alkali plant's reservoir had decreased to a dangerous level, the fresh seawater that the chemical workers had been looking forward to flowed in steadily.

    February 20th
    A Heroic Month

    Due to other work, I temporarily left the Tanggu factory and returned to Tianjin. In the evening, Comrade He Qingqi couldn't wait to tell me a gratifying message on the long-distance telephone: yesterday, February 19th, the daily output of soda ash leaped to the third peak. February 19th was exactly one month away from January 19th, when the first peak was reached. This time the daily output increased by another 1.1% compared to the last time.

    Leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again, climbing three peaks in a month. What do these new records illustrate? This means that in one month's time, the production level that was originally planned to be achieved after the partial expansion project was put into production by the end of this year has already been realized. That is to say, in one month's time, the production level of the Yongli Alkali Plant has been raised to the same level as that of a very large factory belonging to the British "Brunner Mond & Co."

    一月三跃高峰
    ——访永利沽厂的几页日记
    本报记者　尹崇敬
    一月十八日
    赶上“卜内门”，超过“卜内门”
    雪后初晴，天气十分寒冷。争先张贴生产跃进大字报的人们披着皮衣，呵着手背。
    全厂人心鼎沸。工会大门口的“跃进园地”上，一个先进的指标提出来不久，另一个更新的指标又出现在旁边……
    寒冷的天气火热的心，这是我进厂后的第一个印象。
    下午，我访问党委副书记何庆歧同志，向他提出了一个问题：“你们大跃进的目标是什么？全厂职工都明确吗？”何庆歧同志立刻坚定地回答：“明确，全都明确——赶上卜内门，超过卜内门！”英国的这个老牌的“卜内门皇家化学工业公司”，在中国解放以前的二、三十年间一直是永利斗争的对象。当时，我国这个幼弱的民族工业，由于成本高、质量低、产量少，斗争终于失败了，不得不和英国人订立协定：把我国市场上纯碱销售量的45％正式划归“卜内门”，“永利”自己留下55％。解放以后，全厂工人在党的领导下奋勇前进，形势根本改观了，不仅在国内市场上不再受舶来品欺侮打击，而且由于我们的纯碱质量已经超过“卜内门”，因而在东南亚许多国家的市场上，中国纯碱的声誉远较英国的为高。但是，我国的产量比英国还少很多。我们的工人知道，纯碱是“工业之母”，它关系着生铁翻砂、石油精制、炼锑、造纸、玻璃、印刷和人造纤维等二十几种工业的生产。于是，他们决心响应党中央的号召，和其他兄弟厂一道，在十五年或者更多一点时间内，使碱的产量也赶上或者超过英国。何庆歧同志说：“这是一个和平的竞赛，可又是一场艰巨的战斗。我们已经决定：这场战斗就从今天夜里开始。”
    一月十九日至二十三日
    干劲·智慧·科学·经验
    十九日，纯碱系统各个车间的工人正式投入战斗。零时以前，党委副书记和厂长、工会主席、调度长一齐来到车间，检查各项准备工作。原来工人们讨论跃进计划、寻找跃进之路已经十多天了，他们知道得很清楚，这个厂在私营时期生产管理落后，公私合营以来生产潜力也远远没有发挥，几乎每一座塔、每一口锅、每一部机器都有很大潜力可挖。他们进行了一个星期细致的科学的试验，最后经厂部批准，全面提高设备的生产效率。石灰窑和盐水工段每小时多投石灰石和食盐各一吨以上，碳酸机的飞轮每分钟加快十转左右，碳化塔每分钟多进气四立方公尺。解放以前美国工程师给各个干燥锅规定日产四十五吨的定额，解放以来已逐渐提高到八十五吨，今天又再次提高到一百吨以上。
    零时正，今天的第一班工人正式接替班次。厂长向全体工人提出两点响亮的要求，或者说是命令：一要平稳，二要安全。在平稳和安全的基础上大胆地增产，大胆地跃进。
    从表面上看去，今天的各个车间里和平时完全一样，机器转动、仪表升降，工人们安静地操作……。可是，今天的生产和往日大不相同，蒸錏塔、碳化塔等重要的工作岗位，都由一、二十年工龄的老司塔工亲自领导，他们带着助手们和在这里劳动锻炼的大学毕业生，在九层楼高的十几座大塔上不断地轮回巡视，绝对保证生产在每一分钟内都是正常的。
    过去各个车间的工人协作得不怎么好，生产一出问题常常相互埋怨、推托。今天各车间各工段的电话铃不住地叫唤，工人们都主动联系问长问短。关系着生产命脉的动力车间工人们提出并坚决做到了“要气有气、要水有水、要电有电”。
    工人们的革命干劲充分表现在智慧和经验的发挥上，又表现在高度的协作精神上；体力劳动的强度却看不出有多大增加。只是最后一段工序的包装工人们显得十分紧张忙录。由于纯碱产量大大增加，他们来不及装袋、过磅、搬运，推着八十公斤的车子简直小跑步，所有人都满头大汗，碱粉在眉毛和眼毛上结得像霜一样也无暇揩擦。
    二十四小时以后，胜利的喜讯从包装工人们那里传来了：今天的纯碱产量创造了永利建厂四十一年来的最高纪录，比去年的平均日产量提高了26％。
    获得了第一个胜利的工人们，再接再厉，九十六小时以后，又获得了第二个胜利：纯碱的日产量比十九日又增加了8％。
    工人们仍然没有感到满足。他们要乘风破浪，克服纯碱日产量提高后给生产设备上带来的不平衡现象和新暴露出来的一切薄弱环节，把跃进引向第三个高峰。
    一月二十六日
    两场动人心魄的战斗
    今天是星期日，根据电业局的计划，恰好全厂停电。工人们抓得可紧呢！在这二十四小时内，全厂进行了两场动人心魄感人肺腑的战斗。
    动力车间十一号和十二号大锅炉炉膛的后壁裂开了大缝，必须趁机修补。停电以后，落下了炉火，在通常的情况下，要等四十八小时以后，工人才能进去作业。今天，工人们都不愿再按照常规办事。他们确定采取最周密的保护措施，提前进炉施工。他们等了七个小时，当炉温还有一百四十度的时候，有二十多年工龄的老工人张文元和青年工人李博义穿上了防热工作服，戴上了防护面罩，在袖口、裤管和手套、护袜结合的部分用绳索严严地扎紧，搬起一块浸透了水的木板，从炉门插将进去。两人牙关一咬，拳头一勒，趁势跳进了“老君炉”、“火焰山”般的十一号大炉炉膛。外面的同伴立即递进去一桶耐火土，两人在炉内屏住气、站稳脚，以极其迅速的动作用双手捧土抢补裂缝。先后六分钟的时间，大功告成。两人跳出炉来，满脸通红，呼吸显然有些困难。同伴们抽出了那块垫脚木板，木板已经满身伤痕，在轻轻地冒着烟。可是，现在还不是休息的时候，张文元又和另一个工人李长荣纵身跃进了旁边的第十二号大炉，又进行了一次同样的英雄的劳作。
    另一场战斗在十三丈高的二号蒸錏塔里进行。由于日久没有清理，塔内设备的空隙已快被渣滓堵住。今天，厂里的共青团委员会组织了一支三百多人的青年突击队前来进行彻底清理。清理这座塔，可不是件轻而易举的事，塔里有三、四万个与罐头盒大小相似的小瓷罐，得一个个折卸下来，铲掉沾在罐上的一层硬疤，然后再一个个装上。这样的工作在往常得要八天半的时间，可是这次没有在停电的一天之外多占一分钟。清晨，突击队总指挥宣布开始行动。第九层塔楼的小门一打开，猛然一股强烈的阿摩尼亚气味迎面扑来，刺激得塔门附近的人都鼻子发痒想流眼泪，大家都愣住了。不知谁喊了一声：“等什么？还不钻进去！”共青团员张世海等三个人一甩棉袄，嘴上捂了毛巾，一头钻了进去。塔内黑乎乎地，到处冒着蓝色的火星，青年们在里面忍受着非常刺激人的气味，一个又一个地把瓷罐拆下来递出去。二十多分钟过去了，再不出来会晕倒的，站在塔门外已经呛得难受的团委书记着急地叫喊：“赶快出来。”里面却回答：“不完成任务不下火线。”团委书记又大声地喊：“这是命令，不出来不行，让别人换你们！”里面的青年仍然不愿出来。最后在他们伸手向外递瓷罐的时候，才被一个个拉了出来。还没等重新分配，早就候在旁边的两个人又钻了进去。
    二月四日至六日
    革命的友谊的大协作
    进入2月份，一个严重的薄弱环节暴露出来了。由于渤海出现枯潮，海边的扬水站打不上水来，厂内蓄水池的水位由二尺渐渐下降到四寸，只够两三天用了。同时，制碱需要低温度的水，它吸热愈多，盐变成碱的转化率就愈高。可是现在没有新的海水，只能靠本厂生产后的循环水，因而水温日渐增高，纯碱产量随着显著减少，全厂在大跃进声中闹开“水荒”了。工厂党委立即把这一情况，报告中共塘沽区委员会，区委副书记王长群同志马上召集盐务局、电业局、疏浚公司等有关部门的负责人开紧急会议，研究全力支援碱厂大跃进，办法是：把疏浚公司的电动挖泥船开到海里去，抽上水来，通过排泥管，再流经二十华里的盐滩，最后输送到碱厂的蓄水池。
    这一说就不大简单了，可是做起来困难更多。需要利用的那只“塘沽九号”挖泥船早在去年冬天就避进港湾，现在冻得跟大陆连成了一片，扳摇不动，哪里还能开到海上去吸水呢？这一困难把港务局“开凌号”破冰船的工人惊动了。他们豪迈地说：“有我们，去把它撞开。”2月4日早晨，红日刚从海上升起，“开凌号”闯进了正在冬眠中的“塘沽九号”身边，把它周围三千方公尺的厚冰全部撞碎了。
    输泥管道跟引水的沟渠不同，中间还隔着六百公尺的平地。为了解决这个问题，碱厂的土建工程队和许多科室，还有外面的单位，一下子来了四百多个职工，自告奋勇地到海边去抢挖出了一条引水沟。5日上午，海水来了。可是，当海水刚流进原有的已经失修的盐沟旧埝，“呼”的一声给冲夸了。欢乐的人群顿时惊慌起来。这时，下放干部、共产党员谷士云一声号召，许多职工毫不犹豫地跳进了缺口，面对着凛冽的海风，腿靠腿排在刺骨的海水里，堵住它的逃逸之路，让旁的职工迅速把缺口修复。
    6日傍晚，碱厂蓄水池里的循环水已少到危险程度的时候，化学工人们翘首盼望的新鲜海水源源地流进来了。
    二月二十日
    英雄的一个月
    我由于另有工作，暂时离开沽厂，回到了天津。晚间，何庆歧同志迫不及待地在长途电话里告诉我一个可喜的消息：昨天，2月19日，纯碱日产量跃登了第三个高峰。2月19日，这距跃登第一个高峰的1月19日正好一个月。这次的日产量比上次又提高了1.1％。
    跃进，跃进，再跃进，一月三登高峰。这些新记录说明了什么问题呢？这就是说，一个月的时间，已经实现了原定到今年年底部分扩建工程投入生产以后才能达到的生产水平。也就是说，一个月的时间，已经使永久碱厂的生产水平提高到相当英国“卜内门皇家化学工业公司”所属一个规模很大的厂的同等水平。（附图片）
