    110th Anniversary of "The Communist Manifesto"
    February of this year marks the 110th anniversary of the publication of "The Communist Manifesto," the "song of songs of Marxism" and the program of the world communist movement. For 110 years, the great ideas of "The Communist Manifesto," jointly created by the great Marx and Engels, have increasingly grasped hundreds of millions of people with the growth of the international workers' movement, and have become a powerful material force for transforming the world. The history of "The Communist Manifesto" is the history of the irresistible development of the proletarian movement throughout the world, and the history of the brilliant victory of Marxism.
    In 1847, the "League of the Just," then the world's largest proletarian organization and the only international workers' group, invited Marx and Engels to join the League, which fundamentally changed the League. At the League's first congress in London in June of the same year, the Congress accepted the opinions of Marx and Engels and reorganized it into the "Communist League," and its organization was also changed to democratic centralism. Since then, the "Communist League" has become the initial proletarian organization based on scientific communism and severing relations with all utopian socialist schools.
    In November 1847, the Communist League held its Second Congress in London, which entrusted Marx and Engels with drafting the League's program in the form of a manifesto. In February 1848, the first great revolutionary manifesto in human history, "The Communist Manifesto," was published in German in London. This "Manifesto," in Lenin's words, "described in a genius, thorough and clear style the new world view, that is, thorough materialism including social life, dialectics as the most complete and profound development view, the doctrine of class struggle and the worldwide historical revolutionary mission of the proletariat, the creator of the new communist society." It became the revolutionary banner of the working class and all working people.
    Lenin pointed out in 1913 that since the publication of "The Communist Manifesto," world history has experienced three main periods: "The first period is from the 1848 revolution to the Paris Commune (1871); the second period is from the Paris Commune to the Russian Revolution (1905); the third period is from this Russian Revolution onwards." Each period has given Marxism "new confirmation and new victory."
    The Communist League ceased its existence in 1852. In 1868, the "International Workingmen's Association"—the famous "First International"—was born. Marx held its leading position. The "First International" existed and fought for nine years. It "laid the foundation for the international organization established by the workers to prepare for the revolutionary attack on capital... laid the foundation for the international socialist struggle of the proletariat." (Lenin)
    In 1917, forty-eight years after the publication of the Russian version of "The Communist Manifesto," the great October Socialist Revolution broke out. It was a fundamental turning point in world history, a new era in human history, and a brilliant confirmation of the great ideas of "The Communist Manifesto."
    The victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the subsequent victory of the Chinese Revolution are another major turning point in world history. More than one-third of the world's population has broken away from imperialism and entered the banner of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. Now, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has definitely surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, and the world situation has entered a new turning point. The two great revolutionary declarations issued by the Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow in November last year to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution are another programmatic document of world historical significance for the international communist movement. It summarizes the experience of the international communist movement over the past century, especially the past forty years.
    The rapid development of history often exceeds people's estimates. "The Communist Manifesto" served as the program of the "Communist League," which at the time totaled only two to three hundred people. When the First International held its first congress in 1866, the sixty delegates attending the congress represented only twenty-five branches in England, France, Switzerland, and Germany. Now, the world's communists have developed to have communist parties in seventy-five countries, with more than 33 million communist party members. More importantly, the Communist Party has seized power in a series of countries, leading the construction of socialism, and has also become a powerful and broad mass political force in some capitalist countries. The victory of communism throughout the world has become an imminent fact.
    Now, "The Communist Manifesto"—the program for the liberation of the working people of all countries—is widely circulated among the people of the world. By 1952, "The Communist Manifesto" had been translated into seventy-seven languages ​​in the world, in about a thousand versions. In the Soviet Union, from 1917 to 1952, 303 editions totaling 10.74 million copies were printed in the languages of various nationalities of the Soviet Union. In our country, "The Communist Manifesto" has met the Chinese people for more than fifty years. In 1906, the second issue of "Min Bao" (magazine), published in Chinese in Tokyo, contained a part of "The Communist Manifesto" translated by Zheshshen, with the title: "A Brief Biography of German Social Revolutionaries." Its full text was translated and published in Shanghai in April 1920 by Chen Wangdao. The introduction of communism into China completely changed the face of the Chinese revolution and produced the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. After liberation, "The Communist Manifesto" was published in large quantities and widely circulated in China. According to incomplete statistics, from 1949 to the end of 1957, 629,800 copies of "The Communist Manifesto" were published in Chinese, and this number does not include those published in Chinese by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House.

### “共产党宣言”一百一十周年

    “共产党宣言”一百一十周年
    今年2月是“马克思主义的歌中之歌”、世界共产主义运动纲领的“共产党宣言”出版一百一十周年。一百一十年来，由伟大的马克思和恩格斯所共同创作的“共产党宣言”的伟大思想，随着国际工人运动的增长，已经日益掌握亿百万的群众，变成了改造世界的强大的物质力量。“共产党宣言”的历史是全世界无产阶级运动的不可抗拒的发展的历史，是马克思主义的辉煌胜利的历史。
    1847年，当时世界上最大的无产阶级组织和唯一的国际工人团体——“正义者同盟”邀请马克思和恩格斯加入同盟，从此，这个同盟起了根本上的变化。在同年6月同盟在伦敦召开的第一届大会上，大会接受了马克思、恩格斯的意见，改组为“共产主义者同盟”，其组织也改为民主集中制。从此以后，“共产主义者同盟”就成为建立在科学共产主义基础上并且和一切空想社会主义学派断绝了关系的初步的无产者组织。
    1847年11月，“共产主义者同盟”在伦敦召开第二届大会，大会委托马克思和恩格斯起草宣言形式的同盟纲领。1848年2月，人类历史上第一个伟大的革命宣言——“共产党宣言”，在伦敦用德文出版了。这个“宣言”，用列宁的话来说：“用天才透彻鲜明的笔调叙述了新的世界观，即包括有社会生活在内的彻底唯物论，作为最完备最精深发展观的辩证法，论阶级斗争和共产主义新社会创造者无产阶级所负全世界历史革命使命的学说。”它成为工人阶级与一切劳动人民的革命旗帜。
    列宁在1913年指出，从“共产党宣言”出版问世的时候起，世界历史经历了三个主要时期：“第一个时期是从1848年革命到巴黎公社
  （1871年）；第二个时期是从巴黎公社到俄国革命（1905年）；第三个时期是从这次俄国革命时起。”每一个时期都使马克思主义“获得了新的证实与新的胜利”。
    “共产主义者同盟”在1852年终止了它的存在。1868年，“国际工人联合会”——有名的“第一国际”诞生了。马克思担任它的领导职务。“第一国际”存在和战斗了九年。它“奠定了工人们为了准备对资本实行革命的攻击而建立的国际组织的基础……奠定了无产阶级的国际的社会主义斗争的基础”。　（列宁）
    1917年，也就是“共产党宣言”俄文版出版四十八年后，伟大的十月社会主义革命爆发了。它是世界历史的根本转折点，是人类历史的新纪元，是“共产党宣言”的伟大思想的灿烂证实。
    世界反法西斯战争的胜利和接着到来的中国革命的胜利，是世界历史上又一个重大的转折点。世界上三分之一以上的人口和帝国主义断绝了关系，进入和平、民主和社会主义阵营的旗帜之下。现在，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量已经确定地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量，世界局势又进入一个新的转折点。去年11月在莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十周年的共产党和工人党代表会议发表的两个伟大的革命宣言，是国际共产主义运动的又一个具有世界历史意义的纲领性的文件。它总结了近一百年，特别是近四十年的国际共产主义运动的经验。
    历史发展的迅速经常超过人们的估计。“共产党宣言”作为“共产主义者同盟”的纲领，当时这个同盟总共只有二百到三百人。1866年第一国际举行第一次大会的时候，参加大会的六十个代表只代表英、法、瑞士、德国的二十五个支部。现在，全世界的共产主义者已经发展到在七十五个国家都有共产主义政党的组织，和三千三百多万共产党员了。更重要的是，共产党已经在一系列国家中掌握了政权，领导着社会主义的建设，在若干资本主义国家中也已经成为强大的广泛群众性的政治力量。共产主义在全世界的胜利已经成为行将到来的事实。
    现在，“共产党宣言”——世界各国劳动人民争取解放的纲领在世界人民手中广泛流传。到1952年为止，“共产党宣言”已经译成了世界上七十七种文字，一千个左右的版本。在苏联，从1917年到1952年，用苏联各民族语言印刷了三百零三次共一千零七十四万册。在我国，“共产党宣言”同中国人民见面已经有五十多年的历史。1906年，在东京用中文出版的“民报”（杂志）第二期上载有蛰伸摘译的“共产党宣言”的一部分，当时的标题是：“德意志社会革命家小传”。它的全文在1920年4月由陈望道翻译在上海出版。共产主义的传入中国，使中国的革命面貌完全改变，产生了中国人民革命的胜利。解放以后，“共产党宣言”在中国大量出版，普遍流行。据不完全统计，从1949年到1957年底，用汉文出版的“共产党宣言”即有六十二万九千八百多册，这一数字还不包括莫斯科外国文书籍出版局用中文出版的在内。（新华社）（附图片）
