Special dispatch to this newspaper from Xinhua News Agency:

    Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has eliminated the backward phenomena existing in the upsurge of spring planting preparation.

    By mid-January, Xinhui County had completed the spring planting preparation work of accumulating fertilizer, turning the soil, digging rice roots, and repairing water conservancy facilities. According to the county committee's inspection of more than 500 co-ops, advanced and average co-ops each accounted for about 40% of the total, but 20% were backward co-ops. In each advanced township and advanced co-op, there were also backward co-ops and backward production teams, and even within advanced teams, there were backward groups and backward individuals. These backward units were always crawling slowly in the spring planting preparation work, and some were even stagnating.

    In order to change this situation, the county committee severely criticized this phenomenon at a recent meeting of grass-roots Party committee secretaries from various townships, and pointed out that this was a new manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking in the situation of the spring planting upsurge.

    The Party organizations of various townships and co-ops have all examined the reasons for the backwardness of their work. Some co-op cadres examined that the increased production targets they set at the beginning of the year to become thousand-catty co-ops were to cope with the anti-rightist conservative situation at that time; some accepted whatever tasks were assigned by higher authorities without having the confidence to achieve them; a few co-op cadres were even duplicitous, setting thousand-catty plans and thousand-catty measures, but not implementing them. Although Nan Shui Co-op and Bei Shui Co-op in Xiaogang Township formulated increased production plans to raise their per-mu yield from more than 600 catties last year to 1,200 catties and 1,100 catties respectively this year, their increased production measures were not active enough. Some cadres in these two co-ops mistakenly believed that it was enough to report high-yield plans to higher authorities, and they would do as much as they could. Mayuan Township, which had the slowest mud application progress, became a backward township, mainly because the cadres, headed by the branch secretary, were complacent. The director of Mayuan First Co-op boasted that it would take at least fifteen years for other co-ops to catch up with our production. But in less than fifteen days, the mud application progress of many co-ops, such as the neighboring Liping Co-op and Zhonglu Second Co-op, had far surpassed that of Mayuan First Co-op.

    Recently, Party committees at all levels in the county's townships and co-ops have sent a large number of cadres to strengthen the leadership work in backward units. Many townships and co-ops have also drawn cadres and members from advanced co-ops and advanced teams to insert them into backward co-ops and backward teams. In backward co-ops and backward teams, a very small number of cadres with serious conservative thinking who have not changed for a long time have been replaced by members, and people with socialist revolutionary drive have been elected as leaders.

    The county is now launching a large-scale observation and learning, comparison, and competition movement to promote the advancement of backward townships, co-ops, teams, and backward individuals.

### 新会县采取检查、参观、评比等措施  帮助备耕落后单位赶向前

    新会县采取检查、参观、评比等措施
    帮助备耕落后单位赶向前
    本报特约新华社专讯　广东省新会县消灭了备耕高潮中存在的落后现象。
    新会县在1月中旬就完成了积肥、翻土、挖稻根、修水利的春耕准备工作。据县委会检查的五百多个社看，先进社和一般社各占总数40％左右，但有20％是落后社。在各个先进乡、先进社中又都存在落后社和落后生产队，先进队里也有落后组、落后人。这些落后的单位在备耕工作中老是在慢吞吞地爬行，有的甚至停滞不前。
    为了改变这一状况，县委会在最近召开的各乡基层党委书记会议上，严格地批判了这种现象，并指出这是在备耕高潮形势下右倾保守思想的新表现。
    各乡、社的党组织都检查了工作落后的原因。有些社干部检查，在前段订出今年要成为千斤社的增产指标，是为了应付当时反右倾保守的形势的；有些是听随上级分配多少任务就接受多少，自己却缺乏信心去实现它；少数社干部甚至口是心非，订了千斤计划、千斤措施，却不去执行。小岗乡南水社和北水社今年虽然分别制订了每亩产量由去年六百多斤提高到一千二百斤和一千一百斤的增产计划，但是他们的增产措施是不够积极的。这两个社有些干部错误地认为只要订出高额增产计划向上级汇报就行，行动上能够完成多少便算多少。入坭进度最慢的麻园乡成了落后乡，主要是以支部书记为首的干部，有自满思想。麻园一社主任夸口说，别的社要赶上我们的生产，起码要十五年。但是不到十五天，邻近的黎平社、中路二社等许多社的入坭进度就把麻园一社远远抛在后面了。
    全县乡、社各级党委最近都派了大批干部去加强落后单位的领导工作。许多乡、社还从先进社、先进队里，抽出干部和社员插到落后社和落后队中去。在落后社、落后队极少数保守思想严重而又长期不改的干部，都已被社员撤换下来，选出具有社会主义革命干劲的人当领导。
    全县现在又展开了大规模的观摩学习、评比竞赛运动，推动落后乡、社、队和落后人前进。
