Jilin to Achieve "Three Transformations" Within Five Years
The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Enlarged Meeting Resolves to Promote a Great Leap Forward in Production

This newspaper's special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Changchun: On the eve of the Spring Festival, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee. The meeting decided to revise the originally proposed plan for industrial and agricultural development and put forward new goals to the people of the province: Through three to five years of hard work, fundamentally change the face of the entire province. Strive to achieve an annual grain output of more than 10 million tons within five years; local industry will catch up with and surpass the total agricultural income in two to three years.

Before the end of the meeting, Chairman Mao arrived in Changchun and received all the representatives attending the meeting, giving a great boost to the province's Party members and people to achieve the agricultural production plan and overall Great Leap Forward ahead of schedule.

This enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee concentratedly reflected the ever-increasing revolutionary zeal of the broad masses of people in the province and criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of the leadership that lagged behind reality. The meeting unanimously agreed that Jilin Province has fertile soil and abundant water resources, providing extremely good conditions for the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Moreover, the province has a relatively large industrial base, and the proportion of industry has long exceeded the total agricultural output value during the first five-year plan period. Although the completion of the agricultural production plan has been affected by the huge floods in the past two years, the main reason is still insufficient subjective effort, failure to make full use of favorable conditions to overcome natural disasters, resulting in slow progress in agricultural development. In the future, we must resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, boldly mobilize the masses, take effective measures, with the entire Party mobilized and going all out, to ensure that a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in agricultural production can be fully realized this year, laying a good foundation for achieving the agricultural development plan ahead of schedule.

The meeting analyzed the new favorable situation after the emergence of a high tide of industrial and agricultural production in Jilin Province and the key issues in achieving a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. According to the characteristics of Jilin Province, the key issue lies in achieving agricultural irrigation ahead of schedule to combat the threat of natural disasters; and achieving agricultural mechanization ahead of schedule to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power. The original plan of Jilin Province to develop 1.36 million hectares (20.4 million mu) of paddy fields and irrigated land in ten years can be completed ahead of schedule after three or four more major high tides. Regarding the original task of completing the flood control project of 500,000 hectares in seven years, judging from the efforts of last winter and the projects being built this spring, it is estimated that 300,000 hectares can be completed. In this way, the province's flood control task can also be completed within two years ahead of schedule. In addition, the number of pigs raised this year is planned to increase from the current 2.1 million to 4 million. After the aforementioned major indicators are achieved ahead of schedule, by 1964, the average agricultural population in the province can harvest more than one ton of grain.

The meeting believed that Jilin Province relies on mountains in the east, with dense forests, known as the "sea of forests"; however, the central plain and western grassland have sparse forests and are often attacked by floods and wind, sand, and drought. Therefore, it is required to complete the task of soil and water conservation in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas and the task of afforestation throughout the province within five years ahead of schedule. Within seven years, the province's forest cover rate will increase from 27.23% to 41%. In the future, we must advocate that every commune cultivate seedlings and everyone plant trees, turning Jilin Province into one of the regions with the highest afforestation area in the country.

The meeting emphasized that Jilin Province has a large land area and a small population, a short frost-free period, and a deep sense of insufficient labor and animal power. In addition to rationally organizing the labor force and improving labor efficiency, according to the spirit of the central government's instructions, the solution is to implement cooperation among the three northeastern provinces, with the help of central state-owned enterprises, rely on local enterprises to tap their potential, and trial-produce and produce various agricultural machinery suitable for local characteristics, to achieve agricultural mechanization ahead of schedule, so as to change the habit of extensive cultivation and increase unit yield. Strive to basically achieve agricultural mechanization within five years. The number of tractors in the province will increase from the current 1,300 standard units to 15,000 to 20,000 standard units within five years. Make the area of mechanized farming (including the area cultivated with new-style farm implements) reach 2.5 million hectares to 3 million hectares.

The meeting required local industries to actively develop industries that serve agriculture, support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and serve the development of mountainous areas. In the next five years, it is required to develop a number of backbone industries to solve the steel needed for agricultural machinery production, the heavy oil needed for power machinery, as well as chemical fertilizers that directly serve agricultural production, paper-making, textile printing, and dyeing enterprises that serve the lives of farmers, and paper pulp acid, alkali, artificial fiber, and other enterprises that serve mountain production. The meeting required local industries to catch up with in two years and surpass the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries in three years.

The meeting discussed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on improving work methods, emphasizing that to achieve a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, we must first have a revolution in our thinking and work style. The meeting pointed out that without a leap forward in thinking, there will be no leap forward in production. The key to achieving the agricultural development plan ahead of schedule lies in breaking down conservative thinking and thoroughly changing the leadership style. The meeting required leading cadres at all levels to personally engage in experimental plots, truly go deep into the masses, fully support the revolutionary initiatives of the masses, and cultivate the growth of new things. The Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels adopt the method of dividing areas and contracting responsibilities, each with its own base; dividing labor and assuming responsibility, each with its own specialty, going deep into various industries to create typical examples, and doing a good job in experimental fields, experimental factories, and experimental schools.

    农田水利化　农业机械化　全省要绿化
    吉林五年之内实现“三化”
    中共吉林省委扩大会决心促进生产大跃进
    本报特约新华社长春电　春节前夕，中共吉林省委召开省委扩大会议。会议决定修订原来提出的工农业发展规划，向全省人民提出新的奋斗目标：苦战三年五载，基本改变全省面貌。力争在五年内粮食年产量达到一千万吨以上；地方工业在两三年内赶上和超过农业总收入。
    在会议结束以前，毛主席到达长春，并接见了到会的全体代表，给全省党员和全省人民提前实现农业生产规划和全面大跃进以巨大的鼓舞。
    这次省委扩大会议，集中地反映了全省广大人民不断高涨的革命干劲，批判了领导思想落后于实际的右倾保守思想。会议一致认为，吉林省土壤肥沃水源充沛，发展农、林、牧业有极为良好的条件。而且全省工业基础较大，在第一个五年计划期间工业比重早已超过农业总产值。虽然二年来因遭受巨大的水灾而影响农业生产计划的完成，但是主要还是由于主观努力不够，没有充分利用有利条件，战胜自然灾害，以致农业发展进度缓慢。今后必须坚决克服右倾保守思想，放手发动群众，采取有效措施，全党动手，全力以赴，保证今年能全面实现农业生产的大跃进，为提前实现农业发展规划奠定良好基础。
    会议分析了吉林省工农业生产高潮出现以后新的有利形势和实现农业生产大跃进的关键问题。根据吉林省的特点，关键问题在于提前实现农业水利化以战胜自然灾害的威胁；提前实现农业机械化，以克服劳畜力不足的困难。吉林省原订十年发展水田和水浇地一百三十六万公顷（二千零四十万亩）的规划，再经过三、四个大的高潮，就可以提前完成。关于原订七年完成治涝工程五十万公顷的任务，经过去冬的努力和今春正在兴修的工程来看，预计可以完成三十万公顷。这样全省治涝任务也可提前在两年内完成。此外，今年养猪数量计划由现在的二百一十万头达到四百万头。上述各项主要指标提前实现以后，到1964年，全省每个农业人口平均可以收获一吨以上的粮食。
    会议认为：吉林省东部靠山，森林茂密，素有林海之称；但中部平原和西部草原林木稀少，经常遭受水灾和风砂干旱的袭击。因之要求提前在五年内完成山区半山区水土保持任务和全省绿化任务。七年内全省森林复被率将由27.23％增加到41％。今后要提倡社社育苗，人人种树，把吉林省变成全国绿化面积最高的地区之一。
    会议强调指出：吉林省地多人少，无霜期短，劳畜力深感不足。克服的办法，除了合理组织劳动力，提高劳动效率以外，根据中央指示的精神，可实行东北三省协作，在中央国营企业帮助下，依靠地方企业发挥潜力，试制和生产适合于地方特点的各种农业机械，提前实现农业机械化，以改变耕作粗放的习惯，提高单位产量。争取在五年内基本实现农业机械化。全省拖拉机由现在的一千三百标准台在五年内增加到一万五千标准台到二万标准台。使机耕面积（包括新式农具的耕作面积）达到二百五十万公顷到三百万公顷。
    会议要求地方工业积极发展为农业服务的工业，支援农业生产大跃进和为发展山区经济服务。在今后五年内，要求发展一批骨干工业，解决为农业机械生产所需要的钢铁，为动力机械所需要的重油，以及直接为农业生产服务的化学肥料，为农民生活服务的造纸、纺织印染企业。以及为山区生产服务的纸浆酸、碱、人造纤维等企业。会议要求地方工业在两年赶上并在三年超过农副业总产值。
    会议讨论了党中央、毛主席关于改进工作方法的指示，强调实现农业生产大跃进，必须首先在思想作风上来个革命。会议指出没有思想上的跃进，就没有生产上的跃进。提前实现农业发展规划的关键在于打破保守思想，彻底转变领导作风。会议要求各级领导干部要亲自动手搞实验田，真正做到深入群众，全力支持群众的革命创举，培植新生事物的成长。省委和各级党委采取分片包干，各有阵地；分工负责，各有专业的办法，深入各行业创造典型，搞好实验田、实验工厂和实验学校。
