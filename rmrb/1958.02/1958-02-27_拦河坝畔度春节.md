　　County Head Li Zemin had just arrived at the reservoir dam when it was completely dark. The large mast lights on the dam were already flashing. He entered the mat shed, and the young men playing cards on the mat all stood up. He greeted everyone with a smile, telling them to fill the kang (a heated brick bed) with the peanuts, dates, and cigarettes he had brought. Then he took out a roll of red paper and said, "I'm going to spend the Spring Festival with everyone. Come on, let's put up the Spring Festival couplets first and celebrate the holiday properly." The young men jumped up with joy, some rushing to make paste, others running to the dam to fetch the large mast lights.

　　"Spending the New Year's Eve in a thatched cottage," County Head Li explained as he pasted the couplets, "This line means that we have all left our homes to spend the Lunar New Year in this thatched work shed. This is the first time for many of you to spend the New Year away from home, isn't it? What are we doing this for?"

　　"Guarding the dam to irrigate the fields," someone recited the second line softly.

　　"That's right," County Head Li continued, "We are here to guard the reservoir dam on the Daqing River, so that this dam can divert the water of the Daqing River to irrigate over 500,000 mu of land in our Ba County. This approach is called breaking the old conventions to celebrate the Spring Festival." He pointed to the third line, which had already been pasted up, and said with a smile, "Although we are breaking the old conventions, we are still eating peanuts, setting off firecrackers, and putting up Spring Festival couplets. Listen, isn't that the sound of firecrackers echoing on the water?"

　　As he was speaking, mischievous Little Li had already taken firecrackers and run to the high bank to set them off. Two loud "bangs" were heard, and beautiful sparks shot straight up, illuminating the sky over the Daqing River. The crisp echoes reverberated across the water. Then a series of firecrackers exploded in a lively display, rising over the river.

　　County Head Li smiled and called them back, and then posted another pair of Spring Festival couplets and the horizontal scroll. The first line was "180,000 mu of land yielding 1,000 jin of rice," the second line was "40,000 mu of land yielding 200 jin of cotton," and the horizontal scroll read "Bite the bullet, fight hard for three years, and achieve the Five Transformations." He said, "This is our goal." Then he explained, "The Five Transformations are water conservancy, mechanization, electrification, high yield, and afforestation. When that time comes, we will have machines to farm, electric lights in every home, a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and trees everywhere in the county. Our lives will be wonderful."

　　He returned to the shed, sat cross-legged on the mat, and chatted with everyone while peeling peanuts. "Young men, we must work harder. A few days ago, I went to Huanghua County to visit. They are on the barren salt flats by the bitter sea, where no crops have ever grown. There is a mutual aid society there that is reclaiming wasteland to grow rice. Last year, they had 9,000 mu of land, with an average yield of 1,023 jin per mu. They have saline-alkali land, while we have plenty of water and sweet soil. Our conditions are much better than theirs. As long as we apply more fertilizer this year, we can guarantee a yield of 1,000 jin per mu."

　　Little Li, who was nineteen years old, said, "That's right. We didn't harvest much in the past because we didn't use fertilizer. This year, we guarantee to deliver 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to achieve a Great Leap Forward!"

　　At this time, Deputy County Head Li Fen came in with wine and dishes and toasted everyone. Among the thirteen commune members guarding the river dam, Father Zhang Wandai was the oldest, at fifty-nine years old. County Head Li Zemin first offered him a glass of wine, then turned to Little Gao and said, "Even the youngest must have a sip!" Little Gao pushed back, laughing and saying, "I'm not the youngest, Little San is here!" The grass curtain moved, and seventeen-year-old Little San indeed walked in. County Head Li wanted him to drink, but he refused, instead begging Deputy County Head Li to tell a story.

　　Deputy County Head Li Fen was from Xiamatou Village by the Daqing River, not far from the reservoir dam. During the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, he fought guerrillas in this area of the Daqing River. At that time, he was like Little San and Little Gao, just a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old youth. But he didn't have the good fortune of Little San and the others to always stay by his parents' side and live a peaceful life. Seventeen-year-old Li Fen ambushed Japanese soldiers on the Daqing River dike, went to Suqiao to burn watchtowers, and spent the Spring Festival hiding in the reed marshes.

　　"The young men of Daqing River were famous at that time, making the enemy tremble with fear. Six young men from our village once broke into Tianjin, killed a Japanese soldier, and brought back a machine gun."

　　County Head Li Zemin continued, "The young men of Daqing River are all heroes now. The Daqing River, which has never been dammed before, has bowed its head to you! Last winter, you built the dam, reversing the flow of the Daqing River and irrigating 500,000 mu of land in our county. If we hadn't..." Communist Youth League member Zhang Qilai interjected, "Our land would have been ruined. Could we still grow rice without water?" "That's right!" County Head Li said with a smile, "In just five days and five nights, you worked non-stop to build this 60-meter-long, 20-meter-wide reservoir dam. If we work even harder this year, we have hope for a Great Leap Forward."

　　"Otherwise," Little Gao always said with a smile, his voice loud, "Why would we come running here to guard this dam, unwilling to leave even for the New Year? It's all for the thousand-jin rice!"

　　"You're willing to spend the New Year away from home?" County Head Li teasingly asked him. Little Gao didn't care at all. He said, "I'm a bachelor, what's there to be willing or unwilling about? It's not like Zhang Qilai, who has a lot on his mind!" County Head Li smiled and asked Qilai, "Are you married? How many of you are not married?" Little Gao again抢着answered, "There are twelve of us here, and nine of us are bachelors."

　　"When are you going to get married?" Deputy County Head Li Fen interjected and asked them.

　　The young men were all embarrassed and didn't say a word. Even Little Gao was silent.

　　Suddenly, Wang Fushun, nicknamed "Big Girl," who was sitting at the other end, said in a muffled voice, "My future mother-in-law said that I can't get married until our Jianchapu Township achieves a thousand-jin township!" Everyone burst into laughter.

　　At this time, the phone rang. It was a teleconference called by the county party secretary to arrange the sowing of early-maturing crops. After listening to the meeting, the young men started making noise again. Li Zhirong sang the Pingju opera "Little Son-in-Law," and Wang Shuzhen sang the Beijing opera "Borrowing the East Wind." The steady and prudent Father Zhang and Uncle Jin kept going out to check the sluice gates and the water level. The upstream Xiong County released the floodgates, and the water level here kept rising, two centimeters, then another two centimeters. County Head Li Zemin couldn't sit still either. He walked to the telephone, picked up the headset, and directed the sluice gates and embankments in various places to pay attention to the water situation. The phone kept ringing. A small breach was made in the Lower Ninth Embankment of Wangbowa, and a pedestrian who was rushing home for the New Year accidentally fell into the depression. A rescue was being organized there; the water level at the Wanggezhuang Sluice Gate rose to seven meters, and the gate there also had to be raised a bit to release more water to Tianjin…

　　Although the festival had arrived amidst the sound of firecrackers, it was still a tense night on the reservoir dam. Wang Shuzhen also quietly walked out and shone a flashlight on the water level, which had risen to 6.8 meters; then he shone it on the water surface, the current was very rapid, but very rhythmic. His thoughts unconsciously flew in the direction of home. At this time, the three children must have already fallen asleep; the seventy-one-year-old mother and the young wife might still be sewing new clothes for the children under the lamp. Three days ago, when he went home, his wife said that she was going to give birth before or after the New Year, would she have already given birth now? She needed someone to take care of her. No wonder she asked him to stay at home. But the Daqing River Dam was related to the food and clothing of hundreds of thousands of people in the county, how could he stay at home with peace of mind? Anyway, someone in the commune would take good care of her.

　　The sky gradually brightened. Wang Shuzhen and Father Zhang and Uncle Jin all went to the kitchen to make dumplings. On the Daqing River, there was the sound of firecrackers here and there, the echoes forming a continuous sound on the river. Uncle Jin said with a smile, "Listen, how lively the sound is, just like the year of victory, when we took the Japanese watchtower." Zhang Qilai, who was married, walked to the high part of the embankment, looking to the north, listening carefully for the sound of firecrackers from his hometown.

    拦河坝畔度春节
    金凤
    李泽民县长刚刚赶到拦河坝畔，天已经全黑下来，坝上的大桅灯已在闪闪发光。他走进席棚，正在席上打扑克的小伙子们一齐站了起来，他笑着招呼大家把带来的花生、枣和香烟满满摆了一炕，又掏出一卷红纸，说：“我和大伙一起过春节。来吧，来来来，咱们先去把春联张贴起来，好好过个节。”小伙子们高兴得蹦了起来，有人赶着去打浆糊，有人跑到坝上去把大桅灯取了来。
    “茅草庐舍度除夕”，李县长边贴边给大伙讲解：“这一句是说咱们大伙离开了家，在这茅草搭的工棚里过大年夜。你们都是头一次不在家过年吧，咱们这是为的什么呢？”
    “看守堤坝浇水田”，不知有谁轻轻念了一句下联。
    “对啦”，李县长接着说：“咱们这是为了看守大清河上的拦水坝，为了这道坝能引大清河的水来浇咱霸县的五十来万亩土地，这种作法就叫做打破常规过春节。”他指着已经贴好的第三句笑着说：“咱们虽是打破老规矩，咱们也是一样吃花生、放鞭炮、贴春联。你们听，这不是水中鞭炮响连天吗？”
    他正讲到这里，淘气的小李早就拿了鞭炮跑到高高的堤岸上放起来了，只听得“呯嘭”两响，美丽的火花直往上窜，照亮了大清河上的天空。那清脆的回声，在水面迥旋着。接着一连串鞭炮的繁响，在河上升腾起来。
    李县长笑着叫他们回来，把又一副春联和横批张贴起来。上联是“十八万亩千斤稻”，下联是“四万亩双百斤棉”，横批是“咬紧牙关，苦战三年，实现五化”。他说：“这就是咱们的奋斗目标。”接着又解释道：“五化，就是水利化、机械化、电气化、高产化和绿化。到那时候，种地有机器，家家点电灯，每亩一千斤，全县到处绿树成荫，咱们的日子就美满了。”
    他回到棚里在席上盘腿坐下，一面剥花生一面又和大伙聊起来，“小伙子们，咱们得加劲干。前些日子我上黄骅县去参观，人家那是苦海盐边，从来不长庄稼的荒滩上，有个互助社，在那里开荒种稻。去年九千亩地，平均亩产一千零二十三斤。人家那是咸水碱地，咱们的水又多，甜土又多，好条件比他们强多了。只要今年多上肥，保管也能打千斤。”
    十九岁的小李说：“可不是，咱们过去收得少，就是没上肥，今年咱们每亩保证送到万斤肥，就能实现大跃进！”
    这时候，李芬副县长又拿着酒和酒菜进来，向大伙敬酒。看守河坝的十三个社员中就数张万袋老爹年岁大，他今年五十九岁了。李泽民县长先敬他一杯酒，转过身来又让小高说：“最小的也得喝一口！”小高一面推，一面笑着叫：“我不是最小的，最小的小三来了！”草帘一动，十七岁的小三果然走了进来，李县长要他喝酒，他怎么也不肯喝，却央求李副县长说起故事来。
    李芬副县长就是离这拦河坝不远大清河畔下码头村的人，抗日战争和解放战争年代，他都在大清河这一带打游击。那个时候，他和小三小高他们一样，不过是十七八岁的青年，但是他没有小三他们那般有福气地总是待在父母身边，过安生日子；十七岁的李芬，就埋伏在大清河堤边打鬼子，到苏桥去烧岗楼，躲在大苇塘里过春节。
    “咱们大清河畔的小伙子那时是赫赫有名，叫敌人胆战心惊的，我们村里六个小伙子，有一次就直闯天津，杀死一个鬼子，拿出一挺机关枪来。”
    李泽民县长接着说：“大清河的小伙子如今也个个是英雄好汉，从来没有打过坝的大清河，不是在你们手里低了头！去年冬天你们打起了坝，让大清河水倒流，给咱们县浇上五十万亩地吗？要不浇……”共青团员张启来接口说：“咱们的地就要毁了。蓄不上水咱们还能种稻吗？”“可不是！”李县长笑眯眯道：“咱们那才五天五夜，日夜不停打出这道六十公尺长二十公尺宽的拦河坝来。今年咱们再使上劲，大跃进就有希望了。”
    “要不，”小高总是又说又笑，嗓门挺大：“咱们干嘛崩崩的跑来守住这坝，过年也舍不得走，就是为了这千斤稻嘛！”
    “你舍得不在家过年？”李县长有心逗他。小高全不在意，他说：“俺光棍汉一条，有啥舍不得？不比人家张启来，牵肚挂肠的，人多着咧！”李县长笑着问启来：“是结婚了吧？你们还有几个没结婚？”又是小高抢着回答：“我们这里十二个人，倒有九条光棍好汉。”
    “那你们什么时候结婚呐？”李芬副县长插进来问他们。
    小伙子们一下都难为情起来，全不张嘴，连小高也不吭声了。
    忽然坐在那一头外号叫“大闺女”的王福顺，瓮声瓮气说道：“未来的丈母娘说了，非等咱们煎茶铺乡达到千斤乡才准可结婚哩！”大家一听哈哈大笑。
    这时候，电话铃响了，这是县委书记召开的电话会议，布置早熟作物的播种。听完会议，小伙子们又闹腾开了。李治荣唱开了评剧“小女婿”，王淑贞唱起京戏“借东风”。老成持重的张老爹和靳大伯不住出去看闸、看水，上游的雄县放了闸，这边的水就不住的涨，涨了两公分，又是两公分。李泽民县长也坐不住了，走到电话机边，拿起耳机，指挥各地闸口堤防注意水情。电话铃不住地响。王泊洼的下九号堤决了一个小口，一个赶着回家过年的行人不小心掉到洼里去了，那里正在组织抢救；王各庄闸口水涨到七公尺，这儿的闸门也得提一提，多给天津放一些水……
    尽管节日已经在炮竹声中来临，拦河坝上依然是一个紧张的夜。王淑贞也悄悄走了出来，把手电照了一下，水位上升到六点八公尺；又照了一下水面，水流得很急，但是很有节奏。他的心思不知不觉飞奔到家的方向去了，这个时候，三个孩子该早已睡下；七十一岁的老母亲和年轻的妻也许还在灯下给孩子赶缝新衣。三天前，自己回家时，妻子说她年前年后就要生产，现在会不会已经生了呢？她是需要人照应的，难怪她提出要他留在家里。可是大清河坝关系着全县好几十万人的衣食，他怎么能安心待在家里？反正社里会有人好好照顾她。
    天渐渐亮起来。王淑贞和张老爹靳大伯都上伙房?饺子去了。大清河上，这里那里传来一阵阵鞭炮的声音，回声在河上连成一片。靳大伯笑着说：“听，这声音多热闹，就像胜利那年，咱们拿鬼子岗楼那回一样。”结了婚的张启来却走到大堤高处，望着北方，侧着耳朵倾听有没有他家乡的鞭炮声。
