    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's construction investment for the Second Five-Year Plan can be reduced by 30%-40%. This year, it can increase production by 450,000 tons of steel and 400,000 tons of pig iron.

    Lu Dong, based on the materials revealed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the ministry's practice of implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift last year, calculated several major accounts, illustrating that astonishing potential has been unearthed through the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. He said that the big-character posters denouncing waste, covering the courtyards and filling the halls, are placed before the leaders and the masses, which forces people to consider how to do more with less money in every possible way to accelerate the speed of national industrialization. According to the waste that has already been revealed, it is entirely possible for the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to save 30% to 40% of the construction investment of its own designed factories in the Second Five-Year Plan compared with the First Five-Year Plan, allowing 60 or 70 yuan to be used as 100 yuan, and using the investment of building steel plants with an annual output of 6-7 million tons of steel to build steel plants with an output of 10 million tons. Lu Dong said that after preliminary calculations, within this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry can increase production by 450,000 tons of steel and 400,000 tons of pig iron more than originally planned.

    Lu Dong pointed out that an important reason for the above possibility is that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has created an objectively favorable situation of "comparing with the advanced and making great leaps forward." Under the scrutiny of the public, all waste has become a backward phenomenon that people hate, which makes the advanced units that correctly implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results and building the country through diligence and thrift even more respected, establishing two distinct opposing sides. The comparison of the two opposing sides will inspire people to compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and set off revolutionary competition, thereby tapping into endless potential. He cited an example, saying that if all open-hearth furnaces in steel plants across the country could reach the level achieved by No. 1 open-hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Works last year, the country could increase production by one million tons of steel a year. It can be seen how much lovable and enticing huge wealth can be mobilized if conservative thinking is broken! Lu Dong said that once when he went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to inspect work, he was criticized by a worker, who asked why the industrial management department only looked at the average number and not the advanced number? He said that this criticism gave him a great inspiration. Being satisfied with the average number is being afraid of advanced breakthroughs in "balance," and is right-leaning conservative thinking that only cares about following the usual practices. Now, this kind of thinking has begun to be broken by the flames of the mass movement.

    扫掉浪费　涌出潜力
    冶金部第二个五年计划的建设投资可以节约30％—40％。今年可以增产四十五万吨钢和四十万吨生铁。
    吕东根据冶金部所揭露出来的材料，和这个部去年贯彻勤俭建国方针的实践，算了几笔大账，说明通过反浪费反保守运动，已经挖掘出了惊人的潜力。他说，满庭满院揭发浪费的大字报贴在领导与群众的面前，这就逼使人们不能不考虑如何千方百计地做到少花钱多办事，以加快国家工业化的速度。根据已经揭发出来的浪费情况看来，冶金部完全有可能在第二个五年计划将自己设计的工厂建设投资比第一个五年计划节约30％到40％，让六十或七十元钱当一百元用，用建设年产六、七百万吨钢的钢铁厂的投资，去建设一千万吨的钢铁厂。吕东说，经过初步计算，在今年内，冶金部就可以比原计划再多增产四十五万吨钢和四十万吨生铁。
    吕东指出，造成上述可能性的一个重要原因是反浪费反保守运动已造成了一个“比先进、大跃进”的客观有利形势。在众目所指的情况下，一切浪费已成为人们所痛恶的落后现象，这样也就使那些正确执行多快好省和勤俭建国方针的先进单位更加被人们所尊敬，树立起两个鲜明的对立面。两种对立面的比较，将启发人们比先进，赶先进，掀起革命性的竞赛，从而挖掘出无穷无尽的潜力。他举例说，如果今年全国所有钢铁厂的平炉都能达到鞍山第一炼钢厂一号平炉去年达到的水平，一年就可以给国家增产一百万吨钢。可见如果打破保守思想，会动员出多少令人可爱的诱惑人心的巨大财富！吕东说，有一次他到石景山钢铁厂去检查工作时，曾经受到一个工人的批评，这个工人提出，为甚么工业管理部门只看平均数，不看先进数？他说，这个批评给了他以很大启发，满足于平均数就是骇怕先进突破“平衡”，就是只顾循着常轨办事的右倾保守思想。现在，这种思想已经开始被群众运动的烽火冲破了。
