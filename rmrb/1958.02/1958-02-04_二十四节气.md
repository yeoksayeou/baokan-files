　　The Twenty-Four Solar Terms

    Since the Qin and Han dynasties, our ancestors have divided the year into twenty-four equal segments based on climate changes. These include Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, Awakening of Insects, Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain, Beginning of Summer, Grain Full, Grain in Ear, Summer Solstice, Minor Heat, Major Heat, Beginning of Autumn, End of Heat, White Dew, Autumn Equinox, Cold Dew, Frost's Descent, Beginning of Winter, Minor Snow, Major Snow, Winter Solstice, Minor Cold, and Major Cold, collectively known as the Twenty-Four Solar Terms.

    The changes of the four seasons are determined by the Earth's movement around the sun, so the twenty-four solar terms indicate the Earth's position on its orbit. With the Earth's orbit around the sun being 360 degrees, there is a solar term every fifteen degrees. According to Chinese custom, the period between Beginning of Spring and Beginning of Summer is spring, between Beginning of Summer and Beginning of Autumn is summer, between Beginning of Autumn and Beginning of Winter is autumn, and between Beginning of Winter and Beginning of Spring is winter.

    Some of the twenty-four solar terms indicate temperature and rainfall, some indicate seasonal changes, and some indicate the characteristics of agricultural activities. For example, "Spring Equinox" and "Autumn Equinox" indicate changes in the length of day and night. "Summer Solstice" and "Winter Solstice" indicate the arrival of hot summer or cold winter. "Beginning of Spring," "Beginning of Summer," "Beginning of Autumn," and "Beginning of Winter" indicate the beginning of the four seasons. "Rain Water" indicates the end of the dry season with little rain. "Awakening of Insects" indicates that hibernating insects are awakened by the first thunder. "Pure Brightness" and "Grain Rain" indicate that the temperature is gradually increasing and the rainfall is increasing. Folk wisdom says, "Snow ceases at Pure Brightness, frost ceases at Grain Rain," which is the sowing season for crops. Therefore, a North China agricultural proverb says: "Plant melons and beans around Grain Rain." "Grain Full" and "Grain in Ear" indicate that crops are approaching transplantation. A farming saying goes: "Grain in Ear is a busy time for planting, everything must be planted; after Grain in Ear, don't force planting." "Minor Heat" and "Major Heat" indicate the hottest weather in summer. "End of Heat" and "White Dew" indicate that the hot summer has passed, the climate is gradually cooling, and white dew will condense on plants. "Cold Dew" and "Frost's Descent" indicate that the weather in late autumn is getting colder day by day, white dew becomes cold dew, and cold dew condenses into frost. "Minor Snow" and "Major Snow" indicate that winter has arrived and it is starting to snow. "Minor Cold" and "Major Cold" indicate the coldest weather in winter.

    Based on seasonal changes, agricultural production can be properly arranged, so the twenty-four solar terms can be said to be entirely for agricultural service. However, due to the vast territory of our country, the climate varies greatly from north to south. North of Aihui in Heilongjiang has no summer throughout the year, and south of Fuzhou in Fujian has no winter throughout the year. In these areas, some of the twenty-four solar terms are not very applicable. The regions where the climate matches the twenty-four solar terms completely are only the central provinces, such as the Wei River basin, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, and the Jianghuai basin. However, the timing of agricultural activities in these areas is not completely consistent, and there may be discrepancies of several solar terms. For example, when sowing winter wheat in the Jianghuai basin, Autumn Equinox is early, Frost's Descent is late, and Cold Dew is the right time for wheat; in the Yellow River basin, it needs to be advanced to: White Dew is early, Cold Dew is late, and Autumn Equinox is the right time for wheat; in the Northwest and North China regions, it needs to be further advanced to: End of Heat is early, Autumn Equinox is late, and White Dew is the right time for wheat. Weather proverbs are a summary of thousands of years of agricultural production experience in various places. Remembering the changes in solar terms and learning local farming sayings are indeed practical and interesting for cadres who go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production. Below is a song of the twenty-four solar terms for everyone to memorize:

      Spring Rain, Awakening, Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain,
      Summer Full, Grain in Ear, Summer Solstice, Minor Heat, Major Heat in succession,
      Autumn End, White Dew, Autumn Equinox, Cold Dew, Frost's Descent,
      Winter Minor Snow, Major Snow, Winter Solstice, Minor Cold, Major Cold.

### 二十四节气

　　二十四节气
    自秦汉以来，我们的祖先就按照气候的变化，把一年平均地排成二十四个节次。如立春、雨水、惊蛰、春分、清明、谷雨、立夏、小满、芒种、夏至、小暑、大暑、立秋、处暑、白露、秋分、寒露、霜降、立冬、小雪、大雪、冬至、小寒、大寒等，统称为二十四节气。
    四季的变化是随着地球绕太阳的运动而定的，所以二十四节气表示地球在轨道上的位置。以地球绕太阳一周为三百六十度，每隔十五度就有一个节气。按照我国习惯，立春与立夏之间为春季，立夏与立秋之间为夏季，立秋与立冬之间为秋季，立冬与立春之间为冬季。
    二十四个节气，有些是表示气温雨量的，有些是表示四季变化的，有些是表明农事活动特点的。如“春分”和“秋分”是昼夜长短的变化。“夏至”和“冬至”是表示炎热的夏天，或寒冷的冬天已经到来。“立春”、“立夏”、“立秋”、“立冬”是表示春夏秋冬四季的开始。“雨水”表示冬旱少雨的时期已过。“惊蛰”表示冬眠的昆虫，初闻雷声而惊醒。“清明”、“谷雨”表示气温渐高，雨量增多。民间相传：“清明断雪、谷雨断霜”，正是农作物的播种季节。所以华北农谚说：“谷雨前后，栽瓜种豆”。“小满”、“芒种”表示农作物接近移植栽培的时候。农谚说：“芒种忙种，样样要种，过了芒种，不可强种”。“小暑”、“大暑”表示夏天最热的天气。“处暑”和“白露”表示炎热的暑天已过，气候渐凉，草木上会有白露凝结。“寒露”和“霜降”表示深秋天气一天比一天冷，白露成为寒露，寒露又凝结成霜了。“小雪”和“大雪”表示到了冬季，要开始下雪了。“小寒”和“大寒”表示冬季最冷的天气。
    根据季节的变化，能够妥善地安排农业生产，所以二十四节气可以说完全是为农业服务的。但是由于我国幅员广大，南北各地气候相差很多，北方自黑龙江瑷珲以北，全年没有夏季，南方自福建福州以南，全年没有冬季，在这些地方，二十四节气中有些节气就不大适用了。同二十四个节气显示的气候完全相合的地区，只有中部各省，如渭水流域、黄河中下游，和江淮流域等。而这些地区进行农事活动的时间，也不是完全一致的，有时在二十四节气里还要差错几个节气。比如：江淮流域播种冬小麦的时候，是秋分早，霜降迟，寒露小麦正当时；到了黄河流域，就要提前为：白露早，寒露迟，秋分小麦正当时；到了西北、华北地区，再要提前为：处暑早，秋分迟，白露小麦正当时了。天气谚语，是各个地方几千年农业生产经验的总结。记住节气的变化，学会各地的农谚，对下乡上山参加农业生产的干部确是实用而有趣的。下面抄录二十四节气歌一首，以便大家记诵：
      春雨惊春清谷天，
      夏满芒夏二暑连，
      秋处白秋寒霜降，
      冬雪雪冬小大寒。
