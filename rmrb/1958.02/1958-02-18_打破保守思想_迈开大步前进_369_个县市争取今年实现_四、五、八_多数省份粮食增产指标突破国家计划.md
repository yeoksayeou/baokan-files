    (Reported by this newspaper) All parts of the country are stepping up preparations for a great leap forward in grain production this year, to welcome the upcoming high tide of spring plowing.
    According to the national plan, the total sown area of ​​grain crops nationwide this year will be 1.83 billion mu, an increase of more than 31 million mu compared with 1957. Total grain output will reach 392 billion jin, an increase of 22 billion jin compared with 1957, an increase of 5.94%, which is higher than the average annual growth rate of 2% in grain output during the First Five-Year Plan period.
    Many situations show that the enthusiasm for increasing production is very strong in various places, and the grain production plans of most provinces have greatly exceeded the targets set by the state. For example, the planned total grain output of Hebei Province this year is 25 billion jin, exceeding the national target of 19 billion jin by 31.5%; the planned total grain output of Jiangxi Province this year is 17.5 billion jin, an increase of 25% compared with 1957, exceeding the national target of 14.28 billion jin by 22.5%. According to the plans of various places in Fujian Province, nine counties and cities will have yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu this year, and ten counties and cities will reach or exceed 800 jin. The planned output of many regions and counties has broken through the targets at each level. As of early February, the regions that are prepared to reach the "four, five, eight" targets in the entire region this year are: Longxi, Neijiang, Xiangtan, Xiangyang, Laiyang, Huimin, Tangshan, Xingtai, and Zhangye nine regions. Shantou region, which reached the 800-jin target last year, plans to leap to 900 jin this year. Ningbo region in Zhejiang Province plans to increase grain yield per mu to 721 jin, striving to reach 800 jin. Xushui County in Hebei Province will increase grain production by more than double on the basis of 1957.
    The grain production plans in various places this year were formulated on the basis of criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas. Many places have organized a great leap forward in production with a tenacious revolutionary spirit, striving to achieve the "four, five, eight" targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Outline ahead of schedule. One hundred counties and cities in Hebei Province will reach a grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu this year. Thirty-seven counties and cities in Zhejiang Province can achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu this year, of which three counties and cities will reach 1,000 jin. Thirty-three counties and cities in Guangdong Province plan to achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu this year. Among the eighty-two counties in Jiangxi Province, twenty-five counties plan to reach a yield of 800 jin to 1,000 jin of grain per mu this year, and seven counties will reach 700 jin to 800 jin. Twenty-three counties in Shandong Province are striving to achieve grain yields of 400 jin and 500 jin per mu respectively this year. Huanxian and Shouzhang plan to cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River this year and strive to become 1,000-jin counties. Tancheng, one of the ten low-yield counties in Shandong Province, after overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and winning a great victory in winter transformation of nature, is determined to catch up quickly and plans to increase grain yield per mu from 189 jin in 1956 to 500 jin this year. Twelve counties and cities in Liaoning Province are preparing to reach the target of 400 jin of grain yield per mu this year. Guizhou Province, a high-altitude and cold region, also has thirty-one counties and cities planning to reach or exceed an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu this year. According to recent incomplete statistics from agricultural departments, 369 counties and cities distributed in seventeen provinces have prepared to reach the "four, five, eight" grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Outline in 1958.
    Among grain crops, the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes will increase significantly this year. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces and one city in the north, the area of ​​paddy fields will be developed to 30 to 40 million mu. In Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of China, it is planned to expand paddy fields by more than 1.5 million mu this year. Throughout the province, from the banks of the Mudanjiang River in the south to the Huma County area along the Heilongjiang River, each county will have a large area of ​​rice. Henan Province plans to expand the area of ​​rice by 10 million mu this year, an increase of about 1.4 times compared with the existing rice area. Shandong Province plans to develop 2 million mu of rice this year in the areas with lakes, low-lying areas, saline-alkali land, and better water sources. Anhui Province plans to replant more than 5 million mu of rice in the Huaibei area alone this year, an expansion of six times compared with 1957. Southern provinces are also making full use of their superior natural conditions to actively expand the planting area of ​​double-cropping rice. Sichuan Province plans to expand the area of ​​double-cropping rice by 12 million mu to 15 million mu this year. Guangdong Province plans to convert 5 million mu of single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice this year, and convert more than 1 million mu of intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice. Jiangxi Province plans to expand double-cropping rice by 6.94 million mu. Anhui Province will expand double-cropping rice by more than double on the basis of last year.
    The planting area of ​​dryland high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes will also be expanded this year. Liaoning Province plans to expand corn by 3 million mu and potatoes by 600,000 mu this year. Heilongjiang Province plans to expand corn by 1.95 million mu and potatoes by 75,000 mu. Hebei Province plans to expand potatoes by more than 2 million mu.
    While busily building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and managing wheat fields, farmers in various places have broken old habits and made preparations for spring plowing, such as transferring seeds, as early as possible. At present, in order to ensure the realization of a great leap forward in grain production, various places have also put forward corresponding production increase measures, which have been thoroughly implemented through various meetings such as party congresses, people's congresses, model worker conferences, and activist conferences, and have quickly become the vigorous and practical actions of the broad masses. Sixty-four counties and cities in Guangdong Province will basically eliminate drought before spring plowing this year. Hebei Province has continuously carried out production and construction movements centered on water and fertilizer. In late January, the province expanded the area of ​​irrigated land by more than 25 million mu, accumulated more than 500 billion jin of fertilizer, an average of more than 4,000 jin per mu, equivalent to more than twice the amount of fertilizer accumulated throughout the year before cooperativization. The Tangshan region, striving to achieve a yield of 500 jin per mu, has now completed 105% of the water conservancy construction plan and 82.1% of the fertilizer accumulation plan, with an average application of 5,700 jin per mu. Now, the broad masses of cadres and people in rural areas are one high tide after another, striving to overfulfill the various production increase measures targets. The allocated improved rice varieties totaled more than 500 million jin at one time.
    In order to meet the needs of the agricultural leap forward, many areas have also launched unprecedented large-scale technology transfer programs. Henan Province has transferred 150 experienced leading cadres and 3,000 agricultural cooperative members with rice planting skills from rice-producing areas in the province, and invited 3,000 cooperative members with rice planting skills from neighboring provinces to provide specific guidance and assistance to the new rice-producing areas. Hubei Province has drawn 450 rice cultivation experts from Xiaogan and Huanggang regions to form a rice technology guidance team, which will go to Xiangyang, Yichang, Enshi and other regions to teach double-cropping rice cultivation techniques.

    打破保守思想　迈开大步前进
    369个县市争取今年实现“四、五、八”
    多数省份粮食增产指标突破国家计划
    本报讯　全国各地正在加紧安排今年粮食生产大跃进的准备工作，迎接即将到来的春耕生产高潮。
    按照国家计划，今年全国粮食作物播种面积为十八亿三千万亩，比1957年将增加三千一百多万亩，粮食总产量达三千九百二十亿斤，比1957年增加二百二十亿斤，即增加5.94％，高出第一个五年计划期间粮食产量平均每年增长率2％左右。
    许多情况表明，各地增产的劲头很足，绝大多数省的粮食生产计划都大大超过国家规定的指标。如河北省今年粮食计划总产量二百五十亿斤，超过国家指标一百九十亿斤的31.5％；江西省今年粮食计划总产量一百七十五亿斤，比1957年增产25％，超过国家指标一百四十二点八亿斤的22.5％。根据福建省各地的计划，今年将有九个县、市的亩产量超过千斤，有十个县、市达到或超过八百斤。许多专区、县的计划产量更是层层突破指标。截至2月上旬，准备在今年全专区达到“四、五、八”指标的专区已有：龙溪、内江、湘潭、襄阳、莱阳、惠民、唐山和邢台、张掖九个专区。去年就达到八百斤指标的汕头专区，今年准备跃进到九百。浙江宁波专区规划，今年粮食亩产量保证提高到七百二十一斤，争取达到八百。河北省徐水县将在1957年的基础上增产粮食一倍多。
    今年各地粮食生产计划是在批判了右倾保守思想的基础上拟订的。很多地方都以顽强的革命精神，组织生产大跃进，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的“四、五、八”的指标。河北省有一百个县、市要在今年达到粮食亩产四百斤以上。浙江省今年有三十七个县、市粮食亩产可以达到八百斤，其中三个县、市达到一千斤。广东省有三十三个县、市计划今年粮食亩产八百斤。江西省八十二个县中，有二十五个县计划在今年达到亩产粮食八百斤到一千斤，有七个县达到七百斤到八百斤。山东省有二十三个县争取在今年粮食亩产量分别达到四百斤和五百斤，黄县和寿张计划今年跨黄河，过长江，争取成为千斤县。山东省十个低产县之一的郯城，在克服了右倾保守思想和冬季改造自然打了一个大胜仗以后，决心急起直追，计划在今年把粮食的亩产量由1956年的一百八十九斤提高到五百斤。辽宁省有十二个县、市准备在今年达到粮食亩产四百斤的指标。高寒地区的贵州省，也有三十一个县、市计划今年粮食平均亩产达到或超过八百斤。据农业部门最近不完全统计，已有分布在十七个省的三百六十九个县、市准备在1958年达到全国农业发展纲要所规定的“四、五、八”粮食增产指标。
    在粮食作物中，今年稻谷、玉米、薯类等高产作物的种植面积将有显著增加。据北方九个省一个市的不完全统计，稻田的面积将发展达三、四千万亩。在我国最北部的黑龙江省，今年计划扩大稻田一百五十多万亩，全省自南部的牡丹江两岸，直达黑龙江边的呼玛县一带，每县都将有大面积的水稻出现。河南省今年计划扩大水稻面积一千万亩，比现有稻谷面积增加一点四倍左右。山东省计划今年在滨湖、涝洼、盐碱地和水源较好的地区发展水稻二百万亩。安徽省仅淮北地区今年就计划改种水稻五百多万亩，比1957年扩大六倍。南方各省也都充分利用优越的自然条件，积极扩大双季稻的种植面积。四川省今年计划扩大双季稻面积一千二百万亩到一千五百万亩。广东省今年计划单季稻改双季稻五百万亩，间作稻改为连作稻一百多万亩。江西省计划扩大双季稻六百九十四万亩。安徽省将在去年的基础上扩大双季稻一倍以上。
    旱地高产作物玉米、薯类等种植面积，今年也将有扩大。辽宁省计划今年扩大玉米三百万亩，薯类六十万亩。黑龙江省计划扩大玉米一百九十五万亩，薯类七万五千亩。河北省计划扩大薯类二百多万亩。
    各地农民在紧张地兴修水利、积肥和管理麦田的同时，打破了旧习惯，及早进行了春耕前的调运种子等准备工作。目前，为了保证实现粮食生产大跃进，各地并相应地提出了增产措施，通过党代会、人代会、劳模会、积极分子会等各种会议深入贯彻，迅速成为广大群众的轰轰烈烈实际行动。广东省六十四个县市在今年春耕之前要基本上消灭旱灾。河北省持续不懈地开展了以水、肥为中心的生产建设运动。在1月下旬，全省在扩大水浇地面积二千五百多万亩；积肥五千多亿斤，每亩平均四千多斤，相当于合作化前全年积肥量两倍以上。争取实现亩产五百斤的唐山专区目前全区已完成水利建设计划的105％，完成积肥计划的82.1％，平均每亩可施五千七百斤。现在各地农村中广大干部和群众一个高潮接着一个高潮，力争超额完成各项增产措施指标。调拨的稻谷良种一次就有五亿多斤。
    为了适应农业大跃进的需要，许多地区还开展了空前规模的技术传授。河南省已从省内稻区抽调一百五十名有经验的领导骨干和三千名种稻有技术的农业社员，并从邻省邀请了三千名有种稻技术的社员，到新稻区进行具体指导与帮助。湖北省在孝感、黄冈两专区抽调了四百五十名水稻栽培能手组成水稻技术辅导团，前往襄阳、宜昌、恩施等专区传授双季稻栽培技术。
