Xinhua News Agency, February 14th. The Ministry of Education convened a work-study program symposium from February 7th to 12th, gathering relevant leaders from the education departments and bureaus of Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Hunan, and other provinces and cities, as well as principals from nine middle schools. Representatives from the participating regions and schools presented reports and exchanged information about the work-study programs and half-work, half-study activities carried out by their respective schools, along with the experiences gained. The meeting also conducted research and discussions on several key issues.

Based on the reported situations, the current work-study programs and half-work, half-study activities mainly take the following forms:

Non-separation-from-production, community-run middle schools. Students learn and labor simultaneously; they are learners and producers; students and farmers. These schools set their schedules according to agricultural production, with more time spent on learning during agricultural slack seasons and on production during busy seasons; learning on rainy days and production on sunny days; or half a day of learning and half a day of production; more learning on weekdays and more production on holidays. This approach, which neither delays production nor hinders cultural learning, is very popular among farmers. In the vast rural middle schools, two forms are generally adopted. One is to organize students to return to their communes to participate in agricultural and sideline production labor during holidays, vacations, or spare time during the school week. Schools that adopt this approach do not need to change the current teaching plan, but only need to make appropriate adjustments to the holiday arrangements in the school calendar. The other form is to establish experimental plots within the school and organize students to participate in production labor. In urban schools, teaching factories and experimental plots within the school are used to organize students to participate in production labor. Some urban schools also organize students to participate in social production labor during holidays, vacations, and spare time during the school week. Generally speaking, community-run schools are doing better than publicly-run schools, rural schools are doing better than urban schools, schools in mountainous areas are doing better than schools in plain areas, and newly-established schools are doing better than older schools, junior middle schools are doing better than senior middle schools.

From the reports of several regions, it can be seen that the following gains have been made in the past year in carrying out this activity: it has preliminarily established students' love for labor and the working people, and cultivated their labor perspectives and mass perspectives; it has enabled students to learn some basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production labor and some preliminary production skills; through labor practice, some of the knowledge learned by students in the classroom has been confirmed, and the combination of rational knowledge and perceptual knowledge has played a role in consolidating, expanding, and deepening classroom teaching; it has enhanced students' physical fitness; and it has reduced the financial burden on the state and students' families.

Before the symposium concluded, Vice Minister of Education Dong Chuncai delivered a speech. He said that in 1957, schools in many regions creatively launched work-study programs, which is an extremely gratifying new phenomenon on China's education front. He pointed out that this approach has found a new direction and path for reforming China's general education system. It is an effective way to overcome the undesirable tendency of education being divorced from production. Dong Chuncai also pointed out that carrying out work-study programs and half-work, half-study activities is also an important link in implementing the general line of socialist construction of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in education, and it can promote a great leap forward in the development of China's education. He said that although the current practices and experiences in this area are not yet perfect, as long as we can boldly mobilize the masses, strengthen specific leadership, these practices and experiences will gradually improve in the future course of practice. Dong Chuncai required education administrative departments and schools at all levels to, in accordance with the education policy instructed by Chairman Mao, in accordance with the principles of combining education with production, combining theory with practice, combining physical labor with mental labor, and combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, and in accordance with the specific conditions of each region, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, actively and step-by-step, break with conventions, and carry out work-study programs and half-work, half-study activities in a manner appropriate to the time, place, and person; in the process of work, we must pay attention to strengthening socialist ideological education. In the event of major reforms, it is also necessary to ask the local Party committee and government for instructions and decisions.

    为革新普通教育制度指出新方向
    教育部召开勤工俭学座谈会
    新华社14日讯　教育部7日到12日召集北京、河北、河南、辽宁、湖南等省市教育厅局的有关负责人和九个中学的校长举行了勤工俭学座谈会。出席会议的地区和学校的代表都作了汇报，交流了各校开展勤工俭学、半工半读活动的情况和经验。会上并就几个主要问题作了研究和讨论。
    从汇报的情况看，目前开展勤工俭学、半工半读的活动，主要有以下几种形式：
    不脱离生产的民办中学。学生一面学习，一面劳动；他们是学习者，也是生产者；是学生，也是农民。这类学校按农业生产的情况规定：农闲学习，农忙生产；雨天学习，晴天生产；或者半天学习，半天生产；平时多学习，假日多生产。这种做法，既不耽误生产，又能学文化，很受农民欢迎。在广大的农村中学里，一般采取两种形式。一种是利用假期、假日，或者平时的课余时间，组织学生回社参加农副业生产劳动。采取这种做法的学校，不需要改变现行教学计划，只要将校历中有关假期的规定作适当调整就可以。另一种是在校内建立实验园地，组织学生参加生产劳动。在城市学校里，利用校内的教学工厂和实验园地，组织学生参加生产劳动。有些城市学校也利用假期、假日和平时的课余时间，组织学生参加社会生产劳动。就目前开展这一活动的总的情况说，民办学校比公办学校好，农村学校比城市学校好，山区学校比平原地区的学校好，新建学校比老学校好，初级中学比高级中学好。
    从几个地区的汇报可以看到，一年来开展这一活动已有了如下的收获：初步地树立了学生热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的思想，培养了他们的劳动观点和群众观点；使学生学到了一些工农业生产劳动的基础知识和一些初步的生产技能；通过劳动实践，使学生在课堂上所学到的一些知识得到印证，把理性知识与感性知识结合起来，对于课堂教学起了巩固、扩大和加深的作用；增强了学生的体质；减轻了国家的开支和学生家庭的负担。
    在座谈会结束以前，教育部副部长董纯才作了发言。他说，1957年不少地区的学校创造性地开展了勤工俭学的活动，这是我国教育战线上的一种极其可喜的新气象。他指出，这种做法，为革新我国普通教育制度找出了一个新的方向和途径。它是克服教育和生产脱节这个不良倾向的有效办法。董纯才还指出，开展勤工俭学、半工半读的活动，也是在教育事业中贯彻多快好省这一社会主义建设方针的重要环节，它能够促进我国教育事业发展的大跃进。他说，目前在这方面的做法和经验虽然还不完善，但是只要我们能放手发动群众，加强具体领导，在今后的实践过程中，这方面的做法和经验就会逐步地完善起来。董纯才要求各级教育行政部门和学校都要根据毛主席所指示的教育方针，根据教育同生产相结合、理论同实际相结合、体力劳动同脑力劳动相结合、知识分子同工农群众相结合等原则，并且按照各个地区的具体条件，在党委的统一领导下，因时制宜、因地制宜、因人制宜地积极地有步骤地打破陈规地开展勤工俭学、半工半读的活动；在工作过程中，必须注意加强社会主义思想教育。遇有重大改革，还必须请示地方党委和政府决定。
