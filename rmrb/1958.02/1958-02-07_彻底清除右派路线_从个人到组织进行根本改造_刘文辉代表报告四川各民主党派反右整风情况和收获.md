　　I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft of the 1958 National Budget," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1958," and Director Wu Yuzhang's "Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme."

　　This meeting is the last meeting of our First National People's Congress. The meeting is being held precisely at a time when our first Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed and the second Five-Year Plan is continuing to begin, and also at a time when our anti-Rightist struggle has achieved a major victory nationwide. This significantly marks a new stage in China's socialist transformation and socialist construction. I would now like to report on the anti-Rightist rectification campaign in Sichuan Province's CPPCC, democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, provincial and municipal Counselor's Offices, and Research Institute of Culture and History as follows:

　　Anti-Rightist Struggle Achieves Major Victory - Beginning or Preparing to Enter Rectification Campaign

　　Under the correct leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, our democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, CPPCC organizations, and provincial and municipal Counselor's Offices, Research Institute of Culture and History, etc., in Sichuan Province have successively launched a vigorous anti-Rightist struggle since mid-June of last year. As of the end of December last year, except for the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, which have not yet concluded, all others are starting to enter or preparing to enter the rectification campaign on the basis of achieving major victories.

　　In the seven months of the anti-Rightist struggle, a total of 756 rightist elements were exposed in the six democratic parties in Sichuan Province, namely the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), China Democratic League (CDL), China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP), China Zhi Gong Party, and China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), accounting for 10.62 percent of the total number of members of the six democratic parties. The proportion of rightist elements in the leading bodies of the democratic parties was even higher. According to preliminary statistics, the rightist elements exposed among non-party democratic figures accounted for about 10 percent of the total number of people.

　　The anti-Rightist struggle has made us clearly realize that the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists has been premeditated for a long time, and the rightist backbone of the democratic parties has played a role in instigating and directing. They have programs, organizations, and plans; they all have the same sinister purpose, which is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and vainly attempt to restore capitalism and reactionary rule.

　　In order to achieve their sinister political goals, the rightists have organized many formal or informal rightist groups, among which the important ones are: the rightist group headed by Pan Dakui in the China Democratic League, which has established rightist strongholds in Chengdu, Chongqing, Zigong, Ya'an, Nanchong, Neijiang, Luzhou, Xichang and other counties and cities; the rightist group headed by Qiu Zhushuang in the RCCK, which has established rightist strongholds in Chengdu, Chongqing, Ya'an and other places; and the rightist group headed by Lin Quanjui in the CDNCA (Federation of Industry and Commerce), whose members are scattered in Zigong, Wanxian, Nanchong, Suining, Mianyang and other places, and attempted to pull the responsible persons of the Federations of Industry and Commerce of Pengxi, Santai, Ya'an, Jiangyou, Daxian, Jiangjin and other counties and cities into his rightist group. In addition, there is the Guo Zhongheng rightist group in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, etc. Through this anti-Rightist struggle, several black lines connecting them up and down, left and right, and their various conspiracies have been successively exposed, and their reactionary political remarks have been basically crushed. Defeating these rightist groups has not only clarified the past fallacies of so-called "personnel disputes" and "factional struggles," but also created favorable conditions for purifying organizations and fundamentally transforming them in the future. New atmospheres and new situations have emerged.

　　New Atmosphere, New Situation Appears

　　Leftists Consolidated, Rightists Isolated, Middle Elements Received the Greatest Education

　　In what aspects are the so-called new atmosphere and new situation manifested?

　　First, there is a general improvement in thinking. Through the anti-Rightist struggle, everyone's political awareness has been raised, and the line between the enemy and ourselves has been initially drawn, and major issues of right and wrong have been distinguished. For example, some people said: "In the past, I didn't understand what capitalism and socialism were at all. Now I am beginning to understand." Those who were used and deceived by rightists in the past felt even more: "If it weren't for this anti-Rightist struggle, I don't know what I would have become," "The Communist Party really saved me." For example, Li Zixiang, a rightist element of the RCCK, once emphasized the characteristics of the RCCK. He advocated "maintaining the unique ideological feelings of RCCK members," opposed talking about positions and viewpoints, and opposed "mixing components and positions together," and said that his advocacy was in line with the actual psychology of more than 80 percent of RCCK members. However, through this anti-Rightist struggle, after the thorough exposure and criticism of the political ugliness of the rightist elements and their historical, ideological, and social roots, everyone unanimously realized that "bourgeois intellectuals are bound to make mistakes if they are not reformed." RCCK members have become more aware that the social basis of the RCCK is still differentiated from the feudal class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. They not only have a strong bourgeois ideology, but also remnants of feudal ideology, and need to undergo thorough ideological reform even more. In the democratic parties of Sichuan, rightist elements account for about 10 percent; it is estimated that leftist elements account for about 20 percent, and those in the middle state account for about 70 percent. Through the anti-Rightist struggle, the rightist elements have been completely isolated, the leftists have been improved and consolidated to a certain extent, and the middle elements, who are the most numerous, have received the greatest education. On the basis of the victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, the democratic parties also focused on conducting key criticisms of the reactionary remarks of the rightists. For example, the RCCK, based on the nature of the rightists' opposition to the leadership of the Party, opposition to the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposition to the socialist system, and opposition to the Soviet Union, combined with the words and deeds of a certain rightist element, systematically and preparedly held seven key criticism meetings, absorbing all members in the province to participate. This has been of great help to everyone in raising their ideological awareness. Therefore, when the Provincial CPPCC called for the development of a rectification campaign, very active new phenomena appeared in the provincial and municipal (Chengdu) democratic parties, federations of industry and commerce, provincial Counselor's Office, Research Institute of Culture and History and other units in terms of airing views freely, posting big-character posters, and holding large and small forums. From the number of big-character posters, the number is constantly increasing every day, and generally problems and opinions can be raised from the perspective of political stance. This new phenomenon fully shows that after the anti-Rightist struggle, the middle elements have undergone significant changes, and more and more people have turned to the left, leaning towards the Party and the working class; the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism has been initially formed, and the ability to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds using the method of class analysis has been exercised to a certain extent. We must consolidate this ideological foundation, and continue to consolidate and improve it through the rectification campaign and continuous study work in the future.

　　Organizations Begin to Be Purified, Relationships Among Comrades Are Close, Preparing Conditions for Continued Organizational Reform

　　Second, the organization is beginning to be purified. Before the rampant attacks of the rightist elements last year, in order to achieve their sinister political goals, the rightist elements in the political and business circles of Sichuan carried out a series of organizational activities, such as mobilizing their relevant organizations at all levels, universally implementing the so-called organizational line of winning over the backward, uniting the middle, and attacking the progressive, and organizing many formal or informal rightist groups. The first step in their conspiracy was to usurp the real power of leadership in the democratic parties, so as to use legal organizations to carry out illegal activities. The Pan Dakui rightist group once usurped the leadership of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and several municipal committees; the Qiu Zhushuang group also once controlled the Provincial Committee of the RCCK; and the backbone members of the Guo Zhongheng group also usurped important positions in the Provincial Committee and Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. In order to legalize their illegal activities, the RCCK rightist group drafted "The RCCK Provincial Standing Committee Work Rules" to restrict the powers of various business departments; the CDNCA (Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce) rightist group secretly planned to revise the "Organizational Rules of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce" to expand the powers of the office held by the rightists. These rightist groups, which usurped or controlled the real power of leadership, unscrupulously tampered with the political direction and organizational line of the democratic parties. They implemented malicious "big development," recruiting troops and buying horses in large numbers to expand so-called political capital.

　　After the anti-Rightist struggle, after everyone studied Minister Li Weihan's report last year, especially in connection with the series of evil conspiracies of the rightist elements to tamper with the political direction and organizational line of the democratic parties, they deeply realized that the agreement between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties in the past: "Taking middle and upper-level people as the main target for developing members, taking large and medium-sized cities as the focus of establishing and developing organizations; in developing members, adopting the policy of combining consolidation and development, with progressives as the backbone, focusing on absorbing middle elements, appropriately accommodating backward elements, rejecting elements with unclear political faces, and eliminating counter-revolutionary elements" is completely correct. Everyone believes that the rightist line of the rightist elements must be thoroughly eliminated, and everyone has a common demand and determination to implement how to fundamentally transform from individuals to organizations, so that the democratic parties can truly become a political force serving socialism. In the anti-Rightist movement, the democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Sichuan have fundamentally reversed the situation in which some democratic parties were controlled by rightist elements, reorganized and improved the leading core, and the rectification leading groups at all levels, under the correct leadership and specific help of the local Party committees, have been able to correctly grasp the policies and have not experienced major deviations. Generally, there is a relatively clear understanding of the principled issues such as how democratic parties should accept the leadership of the Party, how they should take the socialist road, the issue of the representativeness of members of the democratic parties, what they should represent, and whose interests they should represent. Therefore, a new atmosphere has emerged in organizations at all levels, and everyone can take on the arduous task of anti-Rightist rectification with a positive, responsible, and serious attitude. The organization and discipline have been strengthened compared to the past. In some units, the number of staff has been reduced compared to the past, but everyone is nervous and happy; the relationship between comrades is also more close and united. We believe that such a foundation has prepared very favorable factors for continuing organizational reform.

　　Cadres Give Play to Enthusiasm and Creativity, Various Tasks Have Undergone Great Changes

　　Third, there is a leap forward in work. Judging from the situation in many units such as the democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the CPPCC in Sichuan, the general comrades can further give play to their work enthusiasm and creativity through anti-Rightist rectification. The phenomenon of being calculating about status and treatment, calculating workload, and being lazy has been greatly changed; the various work tasks assigned have been basically completed on schedule. This is the general situation of the cadres of the democratic parties. Reflected in the members of government agencies and schools, with the political call for streamlining institutions and sending cadres to lower levels, many comrades have applied to go to lower levels and are willing to go to the countryside and to the grassroots to exercise. The comrades who remain in the agencies or schools do not feel bitter about the increased workload. For example, in the past, middle school language teachers were unwilling to be class teachers when they taught two classes. Most of the compositions were only changed once every two weeks. Now, they not only teach two classes and work as class teachers, but also correct the compositions once a week, and also participate in voluntary labor, taking students to the countryside to work. They also work harder on political and ideological education and parental work than in the past. These phenomena fully demonstrate that great changes have taken place in various tasks through the anti-Rightist rectification movement.

　　On the basis of the victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, the rectification movement has begun. The rectification movement in the democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Counselor's Offices, the Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, the CPPCC and other units in Sichuan only began in early January this year. When I left Chengdu, it was still in the stage of airing views freely. These days, it may have entered the stage of great debate. We plan to classify the problems raised by each unit according to their nature in the great debate stage, combine them with the issues raised by Minister Li Weihan to the democratic parties, and then target the reactionary remarks exposed by the rightist elements for debate. And focus on the issues of accepting the leadership of the Party, resolutely taking the socialist road, the fundamental transformation of the democratic party organizations and members, organizational line issues, the issue of representing the interests of members, the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie, what are the main problems existing in the upper-level organizations (such as the provincial and municipal democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce), etc., for a great debate to clarify the major issues of right and wrong. In the stage of examining thoughts, naturally, we will not adopt the method of everyone passing the test and making appraisals, and it is not necessary to be approved by mass discussion, but it is required that in the debate and criticism, we consciously combine our own reality, transform our thoughts, and improve our understanding. General administrative work should be rectified and reformed while doing it. Policy guidelines, organizational lines, etc. need to be drawn up on the basis of the victory of the great debate, and prepare to fundamentally transform the organizations together in the future representative congress.

　　Distinguish Situations and Treat Differently - Seriously Handle Rightist Elements

　　Finally, I will talk about the issue of dealing with rightist elements. Except for a very small number of rightist elements in Sichuan's democratic parties who have been properly handled with the anti-Rightist rectification in government agencies and schools, most of them have not yet been handled. The responsible comrades of the democratic parties have come to the central government for a meeting this time, and after the meeting, they will be dealt with in batches under the leadership of the local Party committee. This is another serious political and ideological struggle. We must adhere to the spirit of the instructions of Chairman Mao and the responsible comrades of the Central Committee, and according to the principle of combining seriousness and leniency, distinguish situations and treat differently. Bourgeois rightist elements are enemies of the people. We must not forget that they are our enemies in leniency, so leniency is limited. Contradictions between the enemy and ourselves can also be handled by the method of contradictions among the people, so in seriousness, we must also treat differently in order to achieve the goal of continuing to divide and isolate the rightists, and continuing to unite, educate, and win over the middle elements. Although our anti-Rightist struggle has achieved a major victory and has basically come to an end, the comprehensive handling of rightist elements has not yet begun, and the rectification movement has only just begun. In terms of personal transformation and organizational transformation, we all need to be tempered and tested in a series of future work, in the transformation of thoughts and labor practice.

　　Thanks to the specific help of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the united front work departments of Party committees at all levels, they explained the guidelines and policies, and in the process of fighting, they helped to study the tasks and steps and methods of struggle in each stage; in the specific work of fighting the rightist elements, they also helped to come up with ideas, think of ways, and summarize the experience of struggle, etc., so that the anti-Rightist struggle in the above-mentioned units can be carried out healthily. At the same time, also because the relevant departments transferred some stronger cadres to support the anti-Rightist struggle in the above-mentioned units, solving the problem of insufficient strength in these units, thus enabling our anti-Rightist struggle to be carried out smoothly and achieve today's major victory. This makes us once again realize that only the Party can lead us on the bright road of socialism, and we can only sincerely accept the leadership of the Party to move from victory to victory together with the working people of the whole country.

　　As for myself, I am an uprising personnel. I engaged in reactionary politics for decades, wandering all day long, unable to control my own destiny. Once I saw the general trend clearly and recognized the truth, I made up my mind to resolutely follow the Communist Party and take the revolutionary road. But at that time, I did not understand what the communist worldview was, what the class stand was. Only after making up my mind, I held a firm will, that is: negate the past, affirm the present, believe in the future, completely believe in the Party, rely on the Party, and unconditionally follow the Party. Thus, I was able to pull myself out of the quagmire of reactionary rule, join the ranks of the great people, and become a glorious revolutionary cadre. Under the leadership of the Party, I passed the democratic revolution. Of course, during this period, there was no struggle in thought, no twists and turns. In fact, every movement after liberation, whether it was directly related to me or not, shook me to varying degrees, causing me to engage in varying degrees of struggle in my thoughts. Thanks to the cultivation and education of the Party, and thanks to the increasing brilliance of the socialist cause, my thoughts have been improved every time I go through a struggle, and my determination to rely on the Party and follow the Party has become more and more firm, making me deeply feel that ideological transformation is necessary for people from the old society, and it is a process of arduous struggle, and we cannot be complacent at any time, but as long as we are determined to rely on the Party, ideological transformation can be gradually achieved. Now I have made a greater determination to strive to stand in the position of the working class and pass the socialist test well. I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, our task of handling rightists and rectification movements can definitely be completed victoriously. Under the great call of Chairman Mao, under the correct leadership and specific help of the Party, our members of democratic parties and non-party friends in the united front will also be able to complete self-transformation and pass the socialist test well.

　　Our great motherland is leaping forward on the broad road of socialism. A socialist and prosperous China with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science is already shining in sight. We must unite more closely around the Party, and strive to complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, strive to further fundamentally transform our individuals and organizations, strive to further consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1958 national economic plan.

　　彻底清除右派路线  从个人到组织进行根本改造
    刘文辉代表报告四川各民主党派反右整风情况和收获
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、吴玉章主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。
    这次会议是我们第一届全国人民代表大会最末的一次会议，会议的召开正是在我国第一个五年计划胜利完成，第二个五年计划继续开始的时候，也正是在我们的反右派斗争在全国范围内取得重大胜利的时候，这显著的标志着我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设进入了一个新的阶段。我现在谨就四川省政协及各民主党派、工商界的反右整风运动情形，作如下的发言：
    反右派斗争取得重大胜利  开始或准备转入整风运动
    我们四川省各民主党派、工商联、政协组织和省、市参事室、文史研究馆等，在中共四川省委的正确领导下，于去年六月中旬起都先后展开了轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争，截至去年十二月底止，除民建、工商联尚未结束外，都在取得重大胜利的基础上，正开始转入或准备转入整风运动。
    七个月的反右派斗争，在四川省的民革、民盟、民建、农工、九三、民进六个民主党派中，共揭发出右派分子七百五十六人，占六个民主党派成员总数的百分之十点六二，各民主党派的领导机构中，右派分子所占的比例更大些；在无党派民主人士中揭发出的右派分子，据初步统计，约占总人数的百分之十左右。
    反右派斗争，使我们清楚地认识到：资产阶级右派的反党、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋是蓄意已久的，而各民主党派的右派骨干则扮演了发纵指使的角色，他们有纲领、有组织、有计划；他们都有一个同一的罪恶目的，即推翻共产党的领导，反对社会主义，妄图资本主义和反动统治复辟。
    右派为了实现他们政治上的罪恶目的，曾组织了许多有形或无形的右派集团，其中重要的有：民盟中以潘大逵为首的右派集团，在成都、重庆、自贡、雅安、南充、内江、泸州、西昌等县、市都建立了右派据点；民革中以丘翥双为首的右派集团，在成都、重庆、雅安等地都建立了右派据点；民建（工商联）中以林全九为首的右派集团，他的成员散布在自贡、万县、南充、遂宁、绵阳等地，并企图将蓬溪、三台、雅安、江油、达县、江津等地县、市的工商联负责人都拉入他的右派集团；此外，还有农工民主党中的郭仲衡右派集团等。通过这次反右派斗争，他们上下左右串连的若干条黑线，他们的各种阴谋活动，都先后被揭发出来了，他们的反动政治言论，基本上也被粉碎了。打垮了这些右派集团，不仅澄清了过去所谓“人事纠纷”、“派系斗争”的胡言，而且也为今后纯洁组织、根本改造组织创造了有利的条件。出现了新的气象，新的形势。
    出现新气象、新形势
    左派巩固　右派孤立  中间分子受到教育最大
    所谓新气象，新形势，表现在那些方面呢？
    第一，是在思想上的普遍提高。通过反右派斗争，大家的政治觉悟都提高了，也初步划清了敌我界限和明辨了大是大非。如有的人说：“以前我根本认识不到啥子叫资本主义，啥子叫社会主义，现在才开始明白了。”过去为右派分子所利用和蒙蔽的人更感到：“不是通过这次反右派斗争，我还不知道要变成个啥子样子”，“硬是共产党救了我”。如民革的右派分子李紫翔曾经强调民革的特点，他主张要“保持民革成员特有的思想感情”，反对谈立场、观点，反对“成份、立场一锅煮”，并说他这样主张是符合民革成员百分之八十以上的实际心理的。但通过这次反右派斗争，对右派分子的政治丑恶面目和其历史根源、思想根源、社会根源的彻底揭发批判后，大家都一致认识到：“资产阶级知识分子不经过改造，硬是要犯错误”。民革成员更认识到民革的社会基础还是从封建阶级和官僚资产阶级分化出来的，他们不仅有浓厚的资产阶级思想，还有封建思想的残余，更需要进行彻底的思想改造。四川各民主党派中右派分子为百分之十左右；据估计，左派分子约占百分之二十左右，处于中间状态的约占百分之七十左右。通过反右派斗争，右派分子已完全孤立了，左派有了一定的提高和巩固，人数最多的中间分子所受教育最大。各民主党派在反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上，还着重对于右派的反动言论，进行了分类排队的重点批判，如民革，即就右派反对党的领导、反对无产阶级专政、反对社会主义制度、反对苏联等问题，按其性质，结合某一个右派分子的言行，有系统、有准备的举行了七次重点批判大会，吸收所有在省的成员都参加，这对大家提高思想认识觉悟有很大的帮助。因此，在这次省政协号召开展整风运动的时候，省、市（成都市）各民主党派、工商联、省参事室、文史馆等单位，在大鸣大放、贴大字报、大小座谈会等方面，即出现了非常活跃的新现象。从大字报的数量来看，每天都在不断的增加，而且一般都能从政治立场这一角度来提出问题，提出意见。这种新现象就充分说明经过反右派斗争，中间分子已起了显著的变化，已有愈来愈多的人向左转化，靠拢党和工人阶级；批评与自我批评的气氛已初步形成，用阶级分析的方法去分辨香花与毒草的能力已受到一定的锻炼。这个思想基础，我们必须巩固，并且从今后的整风运动和不断的学习工作中，继续加以巩固和提高。
    组织上开始纯洁　同志间关系密切  为继续进行组织改造准备了条件
    第二，是在组织上开始纯洁。去年右派分子猖狂进攻之前，四川政界和工商界的右派分子，为了实现他们政治上的罪恶目的，进行了一系列的组织活动，如动员了他们各级有关组织，普遍实行拉拢落后、团结中间、打击进步的所谓组织路线，组织了许多有形或无形的右派集团。他们的阴谋第一步是篡夺各民主党派的领导实权，以便利用合法组织来进行非法的活动。潘大逵右派集团即曾经一度篡夺了民盟省委会和几个市委会的领导实权；丘翥双集团也曾一度控制了民革省委会；郭仲衡集团的骨干分子也窃取了农工省委会和重庆市委会的重要职务。为了使他们的非法活动合法化，民革右派集团起草了“民革省常委会工作简则”来限制各业务部门的职权；民建（省工商联）的右派集团密谋修改“省工商联的组织细则”，来扩大为右派所把持的办公室的职权，这些篡夺了或控制了领导实权的右派集团，肆无忌惮地篡改民主党派的政治方向和组织路线。他们实行了恶性“大发展”，大量招兵买马，来扩充所谓政治资本。
    经过反右派斗争，大家通过去年对李维汉部长报告的学习后，特别是结合右派分子一系列篡改各民主党派政治方向和组织路线的罪恶阴谋，更深切体会到过去中共中央与各民主党派协议的：“以中、上层人士为发展成员的主要对象，以大、中城市为建立和发展组织的重点；在发展成员方面，采取巩固与发展相结合的方针，以进步为骨干，着重吸收中间分子，适当容纳落后分子，拒绝政治面貌不清的分子，清除反革命分子”的规定是完全正确的。对于右派分子的右派路线，大家认为必须彻底加以清除，对于如何从个人到组织的根本改造，使民主党派真正能成为为社会主义服务的政治力量，大家都有共同的要求和贯彻的决心。四川各民主党派与工商联在反右运动中，已从根本上扭转了某些民主党派为右派分子所控制的局面，改组和健全了领导核心，各级整风领导小组在当地党委的正确领导和具体帮助下，都能正确掌握政策，没有发生大的偏差。对于民主党派应如何接受党的领导，应如何走社会主义道路，对于民主党派成员的代表性问题，究竟应该如何代表，代表什么人的利益等原则问题，一般都有比较明确的认识。因此，在各级组织中已呈现了一种新气象，大家都能以积极负责认真的态度，负起反右整风的艰巨任务，组织性、纪律性比过去都加强了，有的单位，工作人员比过去减少了，但都很紧张而愉快；同志间的关系也更加亲密团结了。我们相信，这样一个基础，是为继续进行组织改造准备了很有利的因素。
    干部发挥了积极性和创造性  各项工作都起了很大变化
    第三，是工作上的跃进。从四川各民主党派、工商联、政协等许多单位情况来看，一般同志通过反右整风，都能进一步发挥他们的工作积极性和创造性，斤斤计较地位待遇，计较工作量，好逸恶劳等现象，已有很大程度的改变；所布置的各项工作任务已能按期基本完成。这是民主党派机关干部的一般情况。反映在政府机关、学校的成员方面，随着紧缩机构，干部下放的政治号召，许多同志都纷纷申请下放，愿意到农村、到基层中去锻炼，留在机关或学校的同志，并不以工作量加重为苦，如过去中学的语文教师，担任两班功课即不愿兼班主任，作文也多半两周才改一次，现在不仅授两班功课兼班主任工作，而且每周批改一次作文，还要参加义务劳动，带着学生到农村中去劳动。对政治思想教育工作和家长工作等，也作得比过去努力得多。这些现象，都充分说明通过反右整风运动，在各项工作中已起了很大的变化。
    在反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上，开始了整风运动。四川各民主党派、工商联、参事室、省文史馆、政协组织等单位的整风运动，是今年一月初才开始的。在我离开成都时，还在大鸣大放阶段，这几天可能已进入大争大辩阶段。我们准备在大辩论阶段，根据各个单位就所鸣放的问题，按性质分类，结合李维汉部长对各民主党派所提出的若干问题，再针对右派分子所暴露出来的反动言行，进行辩论。并着重就接受党的领导问题、坚决走社会主义道路问题、民主党派组织和成员根本改造问题、组织路线问题、代表成员的利益问题、资产阶级的两面性问题、上一级组织（如省、市民主党派、工商联）所存在的主要问题是什么等等，进行大争大辩，以明确大是大非之所在。在检查思想阶段，自然不是采取人人过关，作鉴定，不是要经过群众讨论通过的办法，但要求在辩论、批判时，自觉的结合自己实际，改造思想，提高认识。一般事务性的工作，应该边整边改，有关政策方针、组织路线等，则需要在大争大辩的胜利基础上订出整改计划，准备在将来的代表大会连同组织加以根本改造。
    分别情况　区别对待  严肃处理右派分子
    最后，我再谈一下关于处理右派分子的问题。四川各民主党派的右派分子，除极少数随着机关、学校的反右整风，作了适当处理而外，一般都还未处理。这次各民主党派的负责同志都来中央开了会，会后将在当地党委领导下分批予以处理。这又是一场严肃的政治斗争和思想斗争，我们一定要本着毛主席和中央各位负责同志的指示精神，根据严肃与宽大相结合的原则，分别情况，区别对待。资产阶级右派分子是人民的敌人，必须在宽大中不要忘记了他是我们的敌人，所以宽是有限度的。敌我矛盾也可以用人民内部矛盾的方法来处理的，所以在严肃中又要区别对待，以期达到继续分化、孤立右派，和继续团结、教育、争取中间分子的目的。我们的反右派斗争虽然取得了重大的胜利，并基本上告了一个段落，但全面的处理右派分子还未开始，整风运动也才在初步展开，就个人改造和组织改造来说，我们都需要在未来的一系列工作中，在改造思想和劳动实践中，受到锻炼和考验。
    由于中共四川省委以及各级党委统战部门给予了具体帮助，交代了方针政策，并在斗争过程中，帮助研究每一个阶段的斗争任务和步骤、作法；在斗争右派分子的具体工作上，也帮助出主意、想办法、总结斗争经验等等，因而使上述单位的反右派斗争能够健康地进行。同时，还由于有关部门抽调出一些较强的干部来支持上述单位的反右派斗争，解决了这些单位力量不足的问题，从而使我们的反右派斗争得以顺利开展，取得了今天的重大胜利，这使我们又一次体会到，只有党才能领导我们走社会主义的光明道路，我们亦只有诚心诚意地接受党的领导，才能同全国劳动人民一道从胜利走向胜利。
    就我个人来说，我是一个起义人员，在反动政权搞了几十年，终日徬徨，不能掌握自己的命运，当我一旦看清了大势，认识了真理，就下定决心坚决跟着共产党走革命的道路。但在当时，我并不懂得什么是共产主义世界观，什么是阶级立场。只是下了决心之后，我就抱了一个坚定的意志，即：否定过去，肯定现在，相信将来，完全相信党，依靠党，无条件的跟着党走。于此，我就得以拔出反动统治的泥坑，参加到伟大的人民行列，作了光荣的革命干部。在党的领导下，过了民主革命关。当然在这段时间中，思想上不是没有斗争，没有曲折的。事实上，解放后的每一个运动，无论对自己有无直接关系，都在不同程度上震动着我，使我在思想上展开不同程度的斗争。由于党的培养和教育，由于社会主义事业的日益辉煌，使我每经过一次斗争，思想都有所提高，使我依靠党、跟着党走的决心越来越坚定，使我深切感到对来自旧社会的人，思想改造是必要的，而且是一个艰苦斗争的过程，任何时候不可以自满，但是只要决心依靠党，思想改造是可以逐步获得效果的。现在我又下定了更大的决心，争取站到工人阶级的立场，过好社会主义关。我坚决相信，在党的正确领导下，我们的处理右派和整风运动任务，是一定可以胜利完成的。我们的民主党派成员和统一战线的非党朋友们，在毛主席的伟大号召、在党的正确领导和具体帮助下，也一定能够完成自我改造，过好社会主义这一关的。
    我们伟大的祖国，正在社会主义的康庄大道上飞跃前进，一个拥有现代工业、现代农业、现代文化科学的社会主义的富强中国，已经灿然在望。我们更要紧密地团结在党的周围，为完成政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命而奋斗，为进一步根本改造我们个人和组织，为进一步巩固和发展人民民主统一战线而奋斗，为完成和超额完成一九五八年国民经济计划而奋斗。
