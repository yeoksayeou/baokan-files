Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 15th. According to Hungarian newspapers, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hungary achieved considerable success last year. A recent article in "People's Liberty" believes that last year was the best year in the ten-year history of the Hungarian cooperativization movement.

By the end of last year, there were 3,465 agricultural production cooperatives (advanced cooperatives) and production cooperative groups (elementary cooperatives) in Hungary, including 2,607 production cooperatives. At the end of 1956, there were only 1,617 advanced cooperatives, about half of the number before the October counter-revolutionary incident.

Last year, the crop harvests of the cooperatives were very good. The average yield per unit area of ​​grains was mostly higher than that of individual farmers, and almost all crops had a larger increase in output than in 1955. For example, last year the average yield per "hold" (approximately 8.55 mu) of wheat, rye, and barley in the cooperatives was 12.3, 8.5, and 13.2 quintals respectively, which was 3.9, 2.1, and 2.3 quintals more than the average yield of individual farmers respectively; 3.8, 1.8, and 2.2 quintals higher than the average yield per unit area of these three grains in 1955. In addition, the yield per unit area of ​​corn, potatoes, and beets also increased compared with 1955.

The increase in livestock in agricultural cooperatives last year was also faster than in previous years, and by the end of the year it had exceeded the original production plan. The number of livestock raised by cooperatives quickly reached or exceeded the level of individual farmers in this regard.

In recent years, the income of members of Hungarian agricultural cooperatives has increased considerably. Last year, the average income per labor day for members was 38 forints (Hungarian currency), an increase of about 15 forints and 11.5 forints compared with 1954 and 1955, respectively. The annual income (including in-kind and cash) received by each member from collective operations increased from more than 6,300 forints in 1954 and more than 7,700 forints in 1955 to more than 11,300 forints last year.

    匈牙利农业合作化运动蓬勃发展
    去年是十年来成绩最好的一年
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　据匈牙利报纸报道，去年匈牙利的农业合作化运动取得了相当大的成绩。“人民自由报”最近发表的一篇文章认为，去年是匈牙利合作化运动十年历史当中成绩最好的一年。
    到去年年底，匈牙利的农业生产合作社（高级社）和生产合作组（初级社）共有三千四百六十五个，其中生产合作社有两千六百零七个。而在1956年底，高级合作社只有一千六百一十七个，约为十月反革命事件前的一半。
    去年，合作社的农作物收成很好，谷物的平均单位面积产量大部分都高于个体农民，并且几乎所有的作物都比1955年的产量有较大的增长。例如，去年合作社平均每霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）的小麦、裸麦、大麦的产量分别为十二点三、八点五和十三点二公担，比个体农民的平均产量分别多三点九、二点一和二点三公担；比1955年这三种谷物的平均单位面积产量分别多三点八、一点八和二点二公担。此外，玉米、马铃薯、甜菜的单位面积产量也都比1955年提高了。
    农业合作社去年家畜的增加也比往年快，到年终时都超过了原定的生产计划。合作社饲养的家畜头数很快地达到或超过了个体农民在这方面的水平。
    几年来，匈牙利农业合作社社员的收入有了相当大的增长。去年社员每个劳动日的平均收入是三十八福林（匈币），比1954年和1955年分别增加了约十五福林和十一点五福林。每个社员全年从集体经营当中得到的收入（包括实物和现金）从1954年的六千三百多福林和1955年的七千七百多福林增加为去年的一万一千三百多福林。
