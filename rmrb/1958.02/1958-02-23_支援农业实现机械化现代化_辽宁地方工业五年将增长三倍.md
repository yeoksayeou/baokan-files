Supporting Agriculture to Achieve Mechanization and Modernization
Liaoning's Local Industry to Grow Threefold in Five Years

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Liaoning Daily, Liaoning Province's local industry has set its targets for this year's Great Leap Forward and the plan for the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1958, the total output value of local industry in the province will increase by 40% compared to 1957, and the output value of handicrafts will increase by 70% compared to 1957. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the output value of local industry in the province will increase threefold compared to 1957, and by 1962, the output value of local industry will be 2.7 times the output value of agriculture and sideline occupations at that time. These indicators were studied and proposed at a meeting of industrial bureau chiefs from various cities held from February 11th to February 16th. The meeting also studied and discussed the Great Leap Forward in local industrial production and the issue of supporting agriculture to achieve mechanization and modernization in a spirit of promotion.

In order to realize the planning targets of the Great Leap Forward in Liaoning Province's local industry, the meeting emphasized that local industry must serve agricultural mechanization and modernization. Supporting agriculture to achieve mechanization and modernization is a policy issue for local industry. From a national perspective, Liaoning Province also bears a great responsibility for supporting agricultural mechanization. This is one of the main aspects of the Great Leap Forward in Liaoning Province's local industrial production. However, at present, local industrial cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of this policy and lack ideological preparation. The meeting believes that after clarifying the understanding, actions should be taken quickly. First of all, agricultural mechanization and modernization research institutions should be established quickly, and immediately go deep into the countryside to conduct investigations and research, understand the needs of agricultural mechanization and modernization, collect relevant technical data, and organize production in accordance with local conditions. The important content of Liaoning Province's local industry's support for agricultural mechanization is to provide machinery needed for rural production, cultivation, water conservancy, agricultural and sideline product processing, and rural electrification. In addition to the machinery allocated by the state and state-planned products, local industry should be fully responsible for manufacturing all small machinery and sporadic machines. It is necessary to overcome erroneous thinking such as only wanting to engage in large-scale production and not small-scale production, only wanting mass production and not small-batch production, only wanting to manufacture and not repair and assemble, and only wanting to produce products with large output value and large profits, and not wanting to produce products with small output value and small profits. The selection, design, and manufacture of machinery used for agricultural mechanization should consider the current shortage of liquid raw materials in our country, and try to adopt solid and other fuels; it should also consider that agricultural machinery should not only be standardized, but also adapted to local conditions to suit the needs of agriculture and sideline occupations in Liaoning Province.

In order to ensure the healthy development of the Great Leap Forward in local industry and the full realization of the plan, the meeting believes that the first thing is to have an all-round Great Leap Forward. It is not only a Great Leap Forward in output value and output, but also a Great Leap Forward in product quality, cost, and variety. That is to say, in the Great Leap Forward, it is necessary to implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, with more, faster, better, and more economical results. Every industry, every enterprise, and every product must compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, consciously establish opposing sides, and find objects to compare with themselves. Secondly, the Great Leap Forward must avoid and overcome blindness. Do not compete for markets and raw materials with each other, do not only care about the present and not the future, only care about one's own unit and not the whole, there must be unified planning, there must be an overall concept, the unified planning must be combined with adapting to local conditions, and the relevant aspects must be combined. In the Great Leap Forward, all relevant departments must cooperate with each other, closely collaborate, and support each other.

The meeting finally proposed that in order to realize the Leap Forward plan, it is also necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over local industry; cadres in local industrial departments must also have a Great Leap Forward in their ideology and work style, implement the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on the universal promotion of planting experimental fields, study technology diligently, and pay attention to studying politics, realize the unity of politics and technology, and become experts who are both red and expert; rely on the masses, implement the mass line, carry out the rectification movement to the end, and deepen and thoroughly carry out the current center of the rectification movement - the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

    支援农业实现机械化现代化
    辽宁地方工业五年将增长三倍
    本报讯　据辽宁日报报道：辽宁省地方工业订出了今年大跃进指标和第二个五年计划的规划。1958年全省地方工业生产总值将比1957年提高40％，手工业产值将比1957年增长70％。第二个五年计划全省地方工业产值要比1957年增长三倍，到1962年地方工业产值等于当时农副业产值的二点七倍。这些指标是在2月11日到2月16日召开的各市工业局长会议上研究提出的。这个会议还以促进的精神研究讨论了地方工业生产大跃进和支援农业实现机械化、现代化的问题。
    为了实现辽宁省地方工业大跃进的规划指标，会议强调地提出了地方工业必须为农业机械化和现代化服务的问题。支援农业实现机械化、现代化，是地方工业的方针问题，从全国来看，辽宁省对支援农业机械化也负有很大责任。这是辽宁省地方工业生产大跃进的主要方面之一。但现在地方工业干部对这一方针还认识不足，缺乏思想准备。会议认为在明确认识以后，应该赶快行动起来，首先应该赶快地把农业机械化现代化研究机构建立起来，并立即深入农村，进行调查研究，了解农业机械化现代化的需要，收集有关技术资料，因地制宜地组织生产。辽宁省地方工业支援农业机械化的重要内容，是为农村生产耕作、水利、农副业加工、农村电气化所需要的机械。农业所需机械，除国家调拨和国家计划产品以外，全部小型机械和零星机器，地方工业要全部负责制造，一定要克服只愿搞大型，不愿搞小型，只愿大批生产，不愿小批生产，只愿制造，不愿修配，只愿生产产值大、利润大，不愿生产产值小和利润小的产品等错误思想。农业机械化所用机械的选择、设计和制造，要考虑我国目前液体原料缺乏的情况，尽量研究采用固体和其他燃料；也要考虑农业机械既要标准化，还要因地制宜，适合辽宁省农副业需要。
    为了使地方工业大跃进健康地发展和全部实现规划，会议认为首先要全面大跃进。不只是产值、产量的大跃进，而且必须在产品质量、成本、品种上也要大跃进。也就是说，在大跃进中要贯彻执行勤俭办企业，多、快、好、省的方针。每个行业、每个企业、每种产品，都要比先进，学先进，赶先进，超过先进，有意识地树立对立面，找出和自己对比的对象。其次，大跃进必须避免和克服盲目性。不要互相争夺市场、原料，不要只顾眼前不顾将来，只顾本位不顾整体，必须有统一规划，必须有整体观念，要把统一规划和因地制宜结合起来，要把有关的各个方面结合起来。在大跃进中，各有关部门必须互相配合，密切协作，互相支援。
    会议最后还提出，为了实现跃进计划，还必须加强党对地方工业的领导；地方工业部门的干部在思想作风上也要大跃进，要贯彻执行中共中央关于普遍推行种试验田的指示的精神，要钻研技术、又要注意学习政治，实现政治和技术的统一，成为又红又专的专家；要依靠群众、贯彻群众路线，要把整风运动搞到底，要把当前整风的中心——反浪费反保守运动搞深搞透。
