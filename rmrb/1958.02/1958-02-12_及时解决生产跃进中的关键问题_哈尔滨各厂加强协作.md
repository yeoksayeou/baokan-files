Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 10th: Harbin City recently convened a series of production technology collaboration meetings at the city, district, and specialized system levels, concentrating efforts to promptly resolve key issues such as sales, materials, and processing capacity that have emerged during the industrial production Great Leap Forward.

The Songjiang Electric Furnace Factory, under the city's First Industry Bureau, will increase its production of urgently needed heat treatment electric furnaces and physicochemical instrument equipment by more than 2,000 units this year compared to last year. However, it lacks more than 2,000 400-degree thermometers and raw material copper sheets. After mutual research at the collaboration meeting, the Yuanji Glass Factory, under the Second Industry Bureau, took the initiative to send technicians to Shanghai to learn to trial-produce these thermometers. The Harbin Enamel Porcelain Factory also began trial-producing industrial enamel porcelain to supply the electric furnace factory, replacing copper sheets.

The Songjiang Chemical Factory will increase its chemical fertilizer production from 44,000 tons last year to 200,000 tons this year. The factory's raw material and additional processing equipment issues were resolved at the collaboration meetings between the factory and the industry bureau. However, a new problem arose – transportation. Because the factory will produce 200,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, its total inbound and outbound transportation volume this year will reach more than 500,000 tons. The past transportation methods using horse-drawn carts and automobiles can no longer adapt, requiring the construction of a three-kilometer-long dedicated railway line. After discovering this problem at the collaboration meeting, they immediately contacted the Railway Administration, which decided to build this dedicated line in June of this year.

At the various levels of production collaboration meetings, technical difficulties that some factories could not solve on their own were also resolved. The Songjiang Cannery will expand its production of export product pickled cucumber canned goods this year, requiring a cucumber washing machine to replace the past manual operation by hundreds of workers. At the technical collaboration meeting, it was decided that the Heli Machinery Factory would help resolve this problem.

    及时解决生产跃进中的关键问题
    哈尔滨各厂加强协作
    据新华社哈尔滨10日电　哈尔滨市最近召开了市、区和专业系统的一系列生产技术协作会议，集中力量及时解决了工业生产大跃进中出现的销路、材料、加工能力等关键问题。
    市第一工业局所属松江电炉厂今年将比去年增产二千多台各地急需的热处理电炉和理化仪器设备，但是却缺少二千多支四百度温度计和原材料铜板。经过协作会议互相研究，第二工业局所属元吉玻璃厂主动派技术工人到上海学习试制这种温度计，哈尔滨搪磁厂也着手试制工业搪磁供应电炉厂，来代替铜板。
    松江化学厂今年化学肥料的产量将从去年四万四千吨增加到二十万吨，这个厂的原料和增添加工设备问题都在工厂和工业局的协作会议上得到解决，但是却出现了一个新的问题——运输问题。因为制造二十万吨化学肥料，这个厂今年进进出出的运输量将达五十多万吨，过去用马车、汽车的运输方式再不能适应了，需要修一条三公里长的铁路专用线。在协作会议上发现这个问题后，立即同铁路管理局联系，铁路局决定在今年6月份把这条专用线筑好。
    在各级的生产协作会议上，也解决了有些工厂本身不能解决的技术上的困难问题。松江罐头厂今年将扩大生产外销产品酸黄瓜罐头，需要一个洗瓜机来代替过去几百个工人的手工操作。在技术协作会议上，这个问题已决定由合力机械厂帮助解决。
