Focus on the Research and Utilization of Alloys and Non-ferrous Metals
Adapt to the Needs of the Socialist Construction Upsurge
Speech by Representative Li Guowei

    After listening to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan," and Director Wu Yuzhang of the Written Language Reform Committee's "Report on the Current Work of Written Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," I feel infinitely excited and greatly encouraged, and I am even more determined to follow the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao on the socialist road.
    Now let me talk about some of my superficial experiences, and please correct me, fellow representatives.

    Several Understandings

    First of all, I want to express my joy and satisfaction with the expected completion of the 1957 National Economic Plan. This is indeed another unprecedented victory for us on the economic front. I also endorse the draft 1958 National Economic Plan with high enthusiasm.
    I deeply realize that the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan has laid the foundation for our country's socialist construction. Now I will talk about it separately:

    (1) Thanks to the active efforts of the Chinese Communist Party leading the people of the whole country and the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, most of the machinery and equipment for heavy and light industries have been able to be manufactured by ourselves. Large-scale equipment such as the blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, and small-scale equipment such as the raw liquid equipment and spinning machines for man-made fibers (page 49 of the General Table of the 1958 National Economic Plan Draft), are all supplied with drawings by the Soviet Union and manufactured by ourselves. This was unimaginable in the semi-colonial era, and this is the first thing that excites and encourages me.

    (2) After the great movement of land reform and the comprehensive promotion of agricultural cooperativization in 1956, the weak link of our country's small cultivated land and large population was correctly identified. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China prescribed the right medicine and decided to develop agriculture by increasing production per unit area. Since the liberation of the whole country, continuous efforts have been made to reclaim wasteland and mountainous areas. The Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program instruct that agricultural production should start with vigorously building water conservancy projects and focusing on the development of chemical fertilizers, creating a law for the development of heavy and light industries in our country that must be combined with agricultural production increases, accelerating the construction of industry, and at the same time improving people's lives, establishing a major plan for our country for thousands of years. This is another thing that excites and encourages me.

    (3) There are many mountainous areas in our country. Once there is heavy rain, it pours down and floods the plains, causing floods. After years of exploration, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely proposed the construction of the electric power industry, with hydropower as the main focus and thermal power as the auxiliary. This wise measure, on the one hand, solves the supply of a large amount of cheap electricity, which is enough to reduce the cost of chemical fertilizers, and provides favorable conditions for the smelting of aluminum ore and other non-ferrous metals; on the other hand, it can intercept floods and prevent them from flowing downstream, and can also be used for irrigation adjustment at any time during the dry season. This is also a resource that benefits our country for generations to come. It can only be organized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to benefit the people.

    (4) Our country is located in the temperate zone, and the population is easy to reproduce, so the population is the largest in the world. The Chinese Communist Party has tried its best to open up employment avenues and achieve overall restoration. For example, last year, the State Council encouraged the excavation of local mines, the panning of gold sand and gold mines, and the expansion and improvement of handicrafts. These are all great measures moving towards the goal of "everyone doing their best." The handicrafts displayed in the Capital Tuanjie Craft Exhibition are exquisite, beautiful, and dazzling, and are the most worthy export sources to win international praise. The ratio of handicraft output value to industrial output value in 1958 even reached 103.7 to 643.7, showing that the Chinese Communist Party cares about people's employment and has made great efforts, making people feel sincerely happy and admired.

    The above four points are just examples based on my understanding, which is enough to show that the government's various policies and guidelines are correct and perfect. We only have to wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Chinese Communist Party, and contribute our efforts to socialist construction with one heart and one mind.

    Regarding the national economic plan, I will now put forward some suggestions to the conference on some scientific and construction issues that I have seen, despite my own limited knowledge. I believe that the government has already considered these issues, but the implementation has a sequence. I will specifically mention them now for reference in case they are needed.

    Two Suggestions

    (1) Please focus on the research of alloys and the utilization of non-ferrous metals in the Academy of Sciences.

    A. In recent years, the development of high heat and high pressure has been changing rapidly. Alloy steel is in great demand for the development and utilization of atomic energy, the chemical industry, and the electric power industry. Even in terms of the world's electric power industry, it is heard that supercritical turbine power plants have reached as high as 350 atmospheres, which saves a lot of fuel. We should catch up and ensure that the development of electric power does not lag behind. In addition, hydropower generation must be reduced during the dry season in winter and must be supplemented by thermal power. The most economical thermal power plant is to build the newest type. This device requires a large amount of alloy, so research on alloys must be prepared in advance to meet the upsurge of socialist construction.

    B. Our country's copper reserves are not abundant, and even the world's copper reserves are scarce. Recently, the electrical industry has been researching the use of aluminum instead of copper. Our country is developing hydropower on a large scale, and we should pay attention to this. The bauxite reserves in southwest China are extremely rich, and the aluminum extraction industry should be developed with emphasis. Countries that are currently short of copper are mostly studying the use of aluminum wire instead of copper wire. Our country wants to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or more. The development of electric power is the most important, so we must prepare early for the power transmission materials for electric wires, transformers, and motors.

    (2) Combine with agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in national topographic surveying.

    In order to comprehensively and rationally plan the water conservancy, roads, and villages within the community; in order to properly allocate the location of paddy fields and dry land in order to open up as many paddy fields as possible; in order to do a good job in rationally planting crops, fruit trees, or trees in mountainous areas and plains; At the same time, in order to adapt to the planning of the surrounding neighboring communities, to remove common obstacles, and to receive mutually beneficial effects, agricultural cooperatives need to measure and draw detailed topographic maps to clarify the location, direction, and contour lines of mountains and rivers within the community, the level and area of high and low fields, the depth of groundwater, wind direction, airflow, and the direction of sunlight, and the amount of monthly rainfall.

    With this topographic map and daily records of climate and rainfall, it is easy to decide where to plant trees, where to cultivate, where to make paddy fields, where to make dry land, where to divert water for irrigation, where to dig ditches for water storage, and where to use groundwater. Then, adapt to local conditions and arrange the planting of crops in order to save effort and achieve more with less, and achieve a bumper harvest.

    Some people doubt whether the current agricultural cooperatives have enough surveying technicians and enough instruments to complete this task. I don't think this is a problem. In the upsurge of going to the countryside for production, many college and middle school students have been assigned to agricultural cooperatives. They all have the foundation of calculation, measurement, and drawing. They only need plane table surveying, supplemented by a simple theodolite and a small level. These two instruments can be used by each community in turn. Other marking poles, tape measures, etc. are essential for cooperation, so there will be no shortage of talents and the cost will not be too high.

    If this work is done well, it can accelerate the completion of national surveying work. Because topographic surveying can be done by cooperatives, the National Surveying Bureau only needs to carry out geodetic surveying (geodetic arc triangulation) and elevation surveying. National fine maps can be prepared early and the cost can be greatly reduced. It is worth considering to accomplish several good things at once.

    These are my humble opinions. Please criticize and correct me, fellow representatives.

    重点研究合金和有色金属的利用
    适应社会主义建设高潮的需要
    李国伟代表的发言
    我听到李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”、薄一波副总理所作“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”和文字改革委员会吴玉章主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，我感到无限的兴奋，我受到了极大的鼓舞，更坚定了我跟中国共产党和毛主席走社会主义道路的信心。
    现在让我讲一些我的粗浅体会，请各位代表指正。
    几点体会
    我首先要表示欢欣而满意于一九五七年国民经济计划的预计完成情况，这的确是我们在经济战线上又一次的空前胜利。我并以高度的热情来拥护一九五八年度国民经济计划草案。
    我深切地体会到，第一个五个计划的胜利完成，奠定了我国社会主义建设的根基。我今分别来讲一讲：
    （一）由于中国共产党领导全国人民积极努力，和苏联兄弟般的无私援助，大部分的重工业和轻工业的机器设备，都已能够自己制造。大型的如武钢的高炉，小型的如人造纤维的原液设备和纺丝机等（一九五八年国民经济计划草案总表第四十九页），都是由苏联供给图样，我们自己制造的。这在以前半殖民地时代，是梦想不到的，这是使我兴奋鼓舞的第一点。
    （二）经过土地改革的大运动，和一九五六年农业合作化的全面推动，正确地察看出我国耕地少人口多的薄弱环节，中共中央对症发药，决定从增加单位面积生产来发展农业，全国解放以来对于开垦荒地山区不断努力，全国农业发展纲要四十条在农业增产上指示要从大力兴修水利和重点发展化学肥料上着手，创立了我国发展重工业和轻工业必须结合在农业增产上的规律，加速推进了工业的建设，同时提高了人民的生活，树立了我国千年的大计，这又是使我兴奋鼓舞的事。
    （三）我国山区很多，一遇大雨，就一泻如注，灌淹平地，造成水灾。中共中央经数年的探测，坚决提出电力工业的建设，以水电为主，火电为辅。这一个贤明的措施，一方面解决了大量廉价电力的供应，足以减轻化学肥料的成本，又为铝矿和其他有色金属的冶炼，提供了有利的条件；另一方面可以拦截洪水，不使泛滥下流，遇旱季时，又能随时作灌溉的调剂。这亦是我国百世利赖的资源，在中国共产党领导下才得举办，而为人民造福。
    （四）我国地处温带，人口易于繁殖，因此人口之多为全球各国之冠。中国共产党尽量开辟就业的途径，做到百废俱举。如去年国务院鼓励土矿的开掘、金沙和金矿的淘采、手工业的扩展和改进，都是向着“人尽其力”的目标迈进的伟大措施。首都团城手工艺展览会内陈列的手工业品，件件精巧美丽、鲜艳夺目，都是最足获得国际称誉的出口货源。一九五八年手工业产值和工业产值之比，竟达到一百零三点七比六百四十三点七，显示出中国共产党关怀人民的就业，做了极大的努力，使人衷心地愉快而感佩。
    以上四点，我不过仅就体会所及，举例而言，已足表明政府各种政策方针无不正确而完美，我们唯有一心一意，听毛主席的话，跟着中国共产党走，万众一心地向社会主义建设，来贡献各人的力量。
    关于国民经济计划方面，我今不揣自己知识的浅陋，就所见到的几个科学和建设上的问题，向大会提出一些建议，这些问题，我相信政府都已考虑到，不过实施有个先后，我今具体的提一提，以供万一的参考。
    两项建议
    （一）请科学院重点研究合金和有色金属的利用。
    甲、近来高热高压的发展，日新月异，合金钢对于原子能的发展利用，化学工业，电力工业等都有巨大的需要。即就世界电力工业而言，闻超临界的涡轮发电站，已达三百五十大气压之高，极省燃料，我们应该迎头赶上，使电力发展，不致落后。兼之水力发电，在冬季枯水季节总须减产，不能不用火电补充，而火电站是以建造最新式的为最经济。此项装置，须用大量合金，所以对于合金的研究，须先做好准备，来迎接社会主义大建设的高潮。
    乙、我国铜矿藏量不丰，就是世界铜蕴藏量亦感稀少，近来对于电气事业都在研究以铝代铜。我国大量发展水电，亟宜注意到此。我国西南矾土的蕴藏，极为丰富，提铝工业，应该重点发展。现在缺铜的国家，大都在研究用铝线代替铜线，我国要在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，电力发展，最为重要，所以对于电线、变压器、电动机等的传电原料，必须早为预备。
    （二）要结合农业合作社做好全国的地形测量。
    为了全面地合理规划社内的水利、道路、村落等，为了适当地分配水田、旱田的位置以期尽量多辟水田，为了做好山区、平原合理地栽种农作物、果树、或林木等；同时，为了适应四周邻社的规划，除去共同障害，并收互利互惠的效果；农业合作社有必要测量和绘制详细的地形图，明确社内山岭河流的位置、方向和等高线，高地低田的水平和面积，地下水的深浅，风向，气流以及阳光的向背，每月雨量的多少等。
    有了这个地形图和气候、雨量的日常记录，就便于决定某地宜种树，某地宜耕，某地可作水田，某地可作旱田，某地可引水灌溉，某地可开沟蓄水，某地可用地下水，而后因地制宜，安排农作物的种植，以期事省功多，取得丰收的成绩。
    有人怀疑现在的农业合作社是否有足够的测量技术干部和足够的仪器来完成这个任务。我看这是不成问题的。在下乡生产高潮中，有许多大中学生下放到农业合作社，他们都有算、测、绘等根基，只须平板测绘，辅以一个简单的经纬仪和一个小型的水平仪，而此两种仪器各社尚可轮流使用，其他标杆、盘尺等本是合作必备之物，所以人才不会缺乏，而费用也不会太多。
    这个工作，如做得好，可以加速完成全国的测量工作。因为地形测量，可以由合作社作成，国家测量局仅须举办大地测量（大地弧形三角测量）和海拔测量，全国精细地图可以提早制就，减少费用甚巨。一举而数善备，似有考虑的价值。
    管窥之见，请诸位代表一并予以批评指正。
