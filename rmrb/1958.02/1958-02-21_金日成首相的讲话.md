Premier Kim Il-sung's Speech

Respected Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai! Dear comrades of the entire delegation! Comrades! Friends!

The visit of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China to our country is about to end. Your visit has aroused infinite joy and gratitude in the hearts of the people of our country.

The Korean people extend their heartfelt and warm welcome to the envoys of the Chinese people, our friends and brothers who share our joys and sorrows. The people of our country celebrated your visit to our country as a grand festival. This is only natural. This is a manifestation of the traditional friendship between our two peoples forged in the struggle against the common enemy who invaded our two countries. It also demonstrates the Korean people's love and deep friendship for the Chinese people.

As the saying goes, "A true friend is only known in times of adversity."

During the most difficult period of the Korean people's struggle against the armed aggression of the US imperialists and the Li Chengwan [Syngman Rhee] bandit gang, the Chinese people aided the Korean people with their blood.

The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, who grew up under the education of the glorious Communist Party of China, established great feats in the struggle to defend the independence of our motherland and protect the revolutionary fruits of our people from the invasion of armed aggressors. The internationalist fighters dispatched by the Chinese people always faithfully implemented the instructions of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong: "Cherish every mountain, every river, every tree, and every blade of grass in Korea."

The lofty internationalist spirit displayed by martyr Luo Shengjiao and the unparalleled bravery of hero Yang Gensi demonstrated the noble political and moral qualities of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The Chinese People's Volunteers not only displayed revolutionary heroism during the war, but also helped the Korean people's reconstruction work after the war as if it were their own.

The infinite love and respect for the Chinese People's Volunteers will forever remain in the hearts of the Korean people. During the difficult period of restoring the war-torn national economy of our country, the Chinese people gave the people of our country tremendous assistance in economic and technical fields.

The great Chinese people have always actively supported the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction.

The friendship between our two peoples has been consolidated and developed through comrade-like cooperation in arduous struggles, and has been tempered through many difficulties and severe tests.

This friendship and relationship of mutual cooperation are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and this relationship is only possible in the united socialist family centered on the Soviet Union.

Our friendship and solidarity with the Chinese people is a great force for us. We are immensely proud to have such sincere friends as the Chinese people.

The visit of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China to our country this time has played a great role in further developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, and has greatly encouraged the Korean people's struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and build socialism. We are deeply convinced that the visit of the Chinese Government Delegation to our country and the results of the talks between the government delegations of our two countries have opened up a new situation for maintaining peace in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue, just as the joint statement issued by the government delegations of the two countries after the talks indicated. We are in complete agreement on all the issues discussed by both sides. This confirms the unbreakable unity and solidarity of our two peoples.

The joint statement shows the firm confidence of the two governments that they will, as in the past, further strengthen our friendship and solidarity for our common cause.

The peaceful reunification of Korea occupied the most important place in the talks between the government delegations of the two countries.

The Government of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people have always made sincere efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The Chinese government fully supports the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5 on the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland through free elections throughout Korea.

In the joint statement of the two governments, the decision on the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea before the end of 1958 was confirmed.

This major measure of the People's Republic of China is a manifestation of the sincere efforts made by the Chinese government to peacefully resolve the Korean issue consistently.

Today, the root cause of the national misfortune and all the difficulties suffered by the Korean people due to the division of the motherland lies in the stationing of US troops in South Korea and the aggressive policy of the United States.

In South Korea under US occupation, national industries have been destroyed, and the agricultural economy has become dilapidated. The US aggressors have plunged the South Korean people into an abyss of darkness and poverty.

As long as the US aggressor troops continue to be stationed in South Korea, the Korean people will never be able to escape the situation of national division, and the South Korean people will never be saved from the indescribable suffering they are suffering.

The US military's occupation of South Korea is the fundamental reason that threatens the peace of our country and hinders our peaceful reunification.

The US aggressors cannot legitimize their troops' stationing in South Korea with any excuse.

We strongly demand that the US troops withdraw from Korea. The governments of all other countries participating in the "United Nations Forces" should also take measures as soon as possible to withdraw their troops from South Korea.

As the joint statement correctly pointed out, now is a serious test for the United States and all other countries participating in the "United Nations Forces." If they have the slightest sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, they should completely withdraw their troops from Korea.

The peaceful reunification of our motherland can only be realized through consultations between Koreans themselves after the withdrawal of all foreign troops.

It is precisely because of this that we hope for peace. We continue to advocate that the armistice be directed towards a consolidated peace, and that the armies of North and South Korea be reduced to a minimum. The huge military expenditure in South Korea has become a great pain for the South Korean people.

We have consistently put forward the following proposals to the South Korean authorities and people from all political parties and social organizations in South Korea: North and South Korea should communicate with each other, reunite together, and consult with each other; we are willing to cooperate with anyone who hopes to peacefully reunify the motherland on a democratic basis, and we will not hold grudges about the past.

This is our unshakable position on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Today, the entire situation is very favorable to the Korean people who are struggling for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The forces of peace and socialism have grown incomparably stronger.

We have the active support and assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries. Peace-loving people all over the world sympathize with and support us.

No matter how difficult it is, the Korean people will surely realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Korean people will always stand firmly on the front lines of the East, defending peace and socialism.

Respected Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai!

Dear comrades of the delegation!

I hope that after you return to your country, you will convey to the Chinese people the infinite love and friendly feelings of the Korean people for the Chinese people. In the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean people will always stand together with the fraternal Chinese people.

Please allow me to propose a toast to the health of the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to the health of Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai and all the comrades of the delegation, to the eternal friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China, and to the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

### 金日成首相的讲话

专栏：

    金日成首相的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理同志！亲爱的代表团全体同志！同志们！朋友们！
    中华人民共和国政府代表团在我国的访问，快要结束了。你们的访问，激起了我国人民的无限的喜悦和感激。
    朝鲜人民对同甘苦、共患难的朋友和兄弟——中国人民的使节，表示了衷心的热烈的欢迎。我国人民把你们在我国的访问期间当作一个盛大的节日来庆祝。这是理所当然的事。这就是我们两国人民在反对侵略我们两国的共同敌人的斗争中结成的传统友谊的表现。这同时说明我国人民对中国人民的热爱和深厚的友谊。
    俗语说：“真挚的朋友只能在艰难的时候才认得出来”。
    中国人民在我国人民反对美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮武装侵略的最艰苦的时期以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    在光荣的中国共产党的教育下成长起来的中国人民的优秀儿女，在从武装侵略者的侵犯中捍卫我们祖国的独立、保卫我国人民的革命果实的斗争中，建立了丰功伟绩。中国人民派遣的国际主义战士们，始终忠实地执行了中国共产党和毛泽东同志的指示：“爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木”。
    罗盛教烈士所发挥的崇高的国际主义精神以及杨根思英雄的无比的勇敢性，表现了全体中国人民志愿军官兵们的高尚的政治道德品质。
    中国人民志愿军不仅在战争时期发挥了革命英雄主义，而且在战后也像对自己的事情一样地帮助了朝鲜人民的恢复建设事业。
    对中国人民志愿军的无限热爱和尊敬将永远留在我国人民的心里。在恢复遭到战争破坏的我国人民经济的艰苦时期，中国人民在经济和技术方面给了我国人民以巨大的援助。
    伟大的中国人民始终一贯地积极支援了朝鲜人民和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的斗争。
    我们两国人民的友谊是在艰苦的斗争中通过同志式的合作巩固和发展起来的，并且通过许多的困难和严重的考验锻炼出来的。
    这种友谊和相互合作关系是建立在马克思、列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，这种关系是只有在以苏联为中心的团结一致的社会主义大家庭中才有可能。
    我们和中国人民的友谊团结，是我们的一支巨大的力量。我们因为有了像中国人民这样真挚的朋友而感到无限骄傲。
    这次中华人民共和国政府代表团在我国的访问，对进一步发展两国的友好合作关系，起了莫大的作用，并且大大地鼓舞了朝鲜人民为实现祖国的和平统一和建设社会主义的斗争。我们深信，中国政府代表团在我国的访问和我们两国政府代表团会谈的结果，为维护朝鲜的和平和朝鲜问题和平解决打开了新的局面，就像两国政府代表团在会谈后发表的联合声明中所表明的一样，我们对于双方所讨论的一切问题，看法是完全一致的。这证实了我们两国人民牢不可破的统一和团结。
    联合声明表明了两国政府今后仍将和过去一样，为了我们的共同事业而进一步加强我们的友谊团结的坚定信心。
    关于朝鲜的和平统一问题，在两国政府代表团的会谈中，占了最重要的位置。
    中华人民共和国政府和全体中国人民，为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，始终一贯地竭尽了真诚的努力。
    中国政府完全支持了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日发表的关于从朝鲜同时撤出一切外国军队、通过全朝鲜的自由选举来实现祖国和平统一的声明。
    在两国政府的联合声明中，确认了关于中国人民志愿军在1958年年底以前全部撤出朝鲜的决定。
    中华人民共和国的这一重大措施，是中国政府始终一贯地为朝鲜问题的和平解决而作出的真挚努力的表现。
    今天朝鲜人民由于祖国的分裂而遭受的民族不幸和一切困难的根源在于美国军队的留驻南朝鲜和美国的侵略政策。
    在美国侵占下的南朝鲜，民族产业遭到了破坏，农庄经济也已零落不堪。美国侵略者使南朝鲜人民陷进了黑暗和贫困的深渊里。
    只要美国侵略军队继续驻扎在南朝鲜，朝鲜人民绝不可能摆脱民族分裂的局面，南朝鲜人民也绝不可能从他们所遭到的难以形容的痛苦中被拯救出来。
    美国军队的强占南朝鲜，是威胁我国的和平和阻碍我国和平统一的基本原因。
    美国侵略者用任何借口也不可能使他们的军队在南朝鲜的驻扎合法化。
    我们强烈地要求美国军队撤出朝鲜。参加“联合国军”的其他所有国家的政府，也应该尽速采取措施，从南朝鲜撤出自己的军队。
    正如联合声明所正确指出的，现在正是严重考验美国和参加“联合国军”的其他所有国家的时刻。如果他们对于朝鲜问题的和平解决有丝毫的诚意，他们就应当从朝鲜完全撤出他们的军队。
    我们祖国的和平统一，只有撤出一切外国军队，通过朝鲜人自己的协商才能得到实现。
    正是因为如此，我们希望和平。我们继续主张，把停战导向巩固的和平，把南北朝鲜的军队缩减到最低限度。南朝鲜庞大的军事开支，成了南朝鲜人民极大的痛苦。
    我们始终一贯地向南朝鲜当局和南朝鲜所有政党、社会团体的人士提出了下列建议：南北朝鲜互相来往，团聚一堂，互相协商；凡是希望在民主的基础上和平统一祖国的人，我们都愿意同他们进行合作，不咎既往。
    这是我们关于和平解决朝鲜问题的不可动摇的立场。
    今天，一切局势都非常有利于为祖国的和平统一而斗争的朝鲜人民。和平和社会主义的力量已经无可比拟地壮大起来了。
    我们有苏联、中华人民共和国和其它社会主义国家人民的积极支持和援助。全世界爱好和平人民同情和支援着我们。
    不管有多大的困难，朝鲜人民一定会实现祖国的和平统一。朝鲜人民将永远坚定地站在东方前哨上，捍卫和平和社会主义。
    尊敬的周恩来总理同志！
    亲爱的代表团同志们！
    希望你们回国以后向中国人民转达朝鲜人民对中国人民的无限热爱和友好的感情。朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，将永远和兄弟般的中国人民站在一起。
    请允许我建议，为了以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府领导人的健康、为了周恩来总理同志和代表团全体同志的健康，为了朝中两国人民之间永恒的友谊团结，为了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结而干杯！
