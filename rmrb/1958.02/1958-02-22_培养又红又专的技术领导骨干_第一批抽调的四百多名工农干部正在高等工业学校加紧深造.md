    Cultivate Technical Leadership Backbone that is Both Red and Expert
    The First Group of Over Four Hundred Worker-Peasant Cadres are Intensifying Their Studies in Higher Industrial Schools
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first group of factory and department-level worker-peasant cadres drawn from the national industrial and transportation systems are intensifying their studies in higher industrial schools in Beijing and other places, in order to cultivate leadership backbone that is both red and expert and can truly master science and technology.
    The decision to draw factory and department-level veteran cadres from industrial and transportation departments to study in higher industrial schools was made by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1956. The former Industrial and Transportation Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party drew more than 400 cadres for the first batch of enrollment in 1956. They were assigned to cadre classes in twelve higher education institutions in Beijing, including Tsinghua University, the Colleges of Industry, Iron and Steel, Aeronautics, Geology, Petroleum, Mining, Railway, and Posts and Telecommunications, as well as Tianjin University, Northeast Institute of Technology in Shenyang, and East China Textile Institute of Technology in Shanghai. Most of these students are veteran cadres from the Anti-Japanese War period, generally having worked in industrial systems for more than two years, are under forty years old, possess a junior high school education level, are in good health, and can persevere in long-term study. The country's requirement for them is: after three and a half to four years of study (including one year of high school cultural studies), they should basically reach the equivalent of a junior college graduate, so that after graduation, they can better undertake production and technical leadership work.
    The leaders of the aforementioned twelve colleges and universities generally attach great importance to the training of these veteran cadres. They have formulated special teaching plans for the cadre classes and have equipped them with better teachers. The teachers in charge of teaching are generally active and strive to regard the training of veteran cadres as a glorious task. Some colleges and universities have boldly improved the teaching methods and examination methods in aspects that are not suitable for the characteristics of worker-peasant veteran cadres. The cadres studying at the school, recognizing the important significance of the Party's call for them to study for the construction of socialism, the vast majority of comrades are actively striving, and many people often do not rest even on Sundays, studying hard. Although most of these cadres had a junior high school education level before enrollment, and had not turned the pages of natural science books for more than ten years, from May 1956 to the end of 1957, in less than two years, after reviewing junior high school courses and studying high school courses, they have transferred to studying university courses; individual classes with originally higher levels have even basically completed the university general courses. Except for a very few people who have some difficulties in learning, the academic performance of most students is relatively good. The problem that needs to be further improved at present is how to conduct teaching according to the different levels of the students and more in line with the actual situation of veteran cadres, which is worthy of attention and research by relevant colleges and universities.
    Recently, the Industrial Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has notified the industrial ministries of the State Council to start preparing for the drawing of cadres for the second batch of enrollment in 1958. This time, it has been decided to draw more than 300 state-owned industrial factory and department-level cadres, and at the same time, it has notified the local industrial departments to draw a certain number of cadres of the same level for enrollment.
    In 1956, while drawing factory and department-level cadres, more than 30 section chiefs, workshop directors, and technicians from worker backgrounds who participated in revolutionary work before liberation and had a high school diploma were also drawn to study in university undergraduate programs to be trained as engineering and technical personnel. The number of cadres drawn in 1958 has increased greatly. Only the state-owned industrial system will draw more than 400 people. Similarly, the local industrial system will also select a certain number of cadres of the same level for enrollment.

    培养又红又专的技术领导骨干
    第一批抽调的四百多名工农干部正在高等工业学校加紧深造
    新华社讯　第一批由全国工业交通系统中抽调出来的厂、处级工农干部，正在北京等地的高等工业学校加紧深造，以便培养成又红又专、真正能掌握科学技术的领导骨干。
    从工业交通部门中抽调厂、处级老干部进入高等工业学校学习，是中共中央在1956年决定的。前中共中央工业交通部在1956年抽调的第一批入校学习的干部共有四百多人。他们被分配在北京的清华大学，工业、钢铁、航空、地质、石油、矿业、铁道、邮电等学院，以及天津大学，沈阳东北工学院，上海华东纺织工学院等十二所高等院校干部班学习。这批学员大部分是抗日战争时期的老干部，一般都在工业系统中工作过两年以上，年龄在四十岁以下，并且具有初中文化程度，身体健康，能够坚持长期学习。国家对他们的要求是：经过三年半到四年（包括一年高中文化学习）的学习时间，基本上达到相当于大学专科毕业的程度，使他们在毕业之后，能够更好地担负起生产技术领导工作。
    上述十二所院校领导上对培养这些老干部，一般都很重视。他们为干部班制订了专门的教学计划，配备了较好的教员。担任教学的教员，一般都积极努力，把培养老干部视为光荣的任务。有些院校在教学方法和考核成绩方法方面，对于不适合工农老干部特点的地方已经作了大胆的改进。在校学习的干部由于认识到党调他们学习对建设社会主义的重要意义，绝大多数同志都积极努力，不少的人常常在星期日也不休息，刻苦学习。这些干部虽然在入学之前绝大部分是初中程度，而且十多年没有翻自然科学的书本，但从1956年5月到1957年末在不到两年的时间内，经过复习初中课程学习高中课程，已转入学习大学课程；个别班原来程度较高的，甚至把大学普通课基本上学完了。除了极少数人学习有些困难外，大多数学员的学习成绩是较好的。目前需要继续改进的问题是如何根据学员的不同程度和更切合老干部的实际情况来进行教学，值得有关院校重视和研究。
    最近，中共中央工业工作部已经通知国务院各工业部，着手准备抽调1958年第二批入学的干部。这次决定抽调国营工业厂、处级干部共三百多名，同时也通知各地方工业部门抽调一定数量的同级干部入学。
    1956年在抽调厂处级干部的同时，也抽调了在解放前参加革命工作，具有高中毕业文化程度的科长、车间主任、工人出身的技术员三十余名入大学本科学习，培养成为工程技术人材。1958年抽调数字大大增加，仅国营工业系统即将抽调四百余名。同样的地方工业系统也将选送一定数量的同级干部入学。
