　　Cao Chong Weighs an Elephant
　　Wu Guanzhou
    During the late Han Dynasty, someone presented a large elephant to the emperor. Prime Minister Cao Cao wanted to know the weight of the elephant, but there wasn't a scale big enough to weigh it, and the officials were at a loss. Cao Chong was still young at the time, but he came up with a solution: first, load the elephant into a boat, and mark the waterline on the hull. Then, lead the elephant back to shore and load stones into the boat until it sank to the marked waterline. By weighing the stones, the total weight could be calculated, which would be the weight of the elephant.

    Cao Chong cleverly used the principles of buoyancy and equilibrium.

    In fact, there was an even simpler method, which is to use "Archimedes' Principle." This principle was discovered several centuries before the Three Kingdoms period by the Greek philosopher Archimedes. Unfortunately, due to blocked transportation and lack of cultural exchange, people didn't know about it at the time.

    Now let's explain Archimedes' Principle:

    One cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram at zero degrees Celsius (note). One cubic centimeter of iron weighs 7.8 grams. With the same volume, iron is heavier than water. When this piece of iron is placed in water, the water exerts a buoyant force on it. How much buoyancy is there? One gram. According to Archimedes' Principle: "An object immersed in a liquid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the object." Now the volume of the iron is one cubic centimeter, so it displaces one cubic centimeter of water. One cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram, so the buoyant force is one gram.

    7.8 grams is the weight of this piece of iron, which is its gravitational force. The gravitational force acts straight downwards, while the buoyant force acts straight upwards. These two forces are in opposite directions, so they cancel each other out. 7.8 grams minus one gram leaves 6.8 grams, which is the weight of the iron in the water. Because the gravitational force is greater than the buoyant force, the iron block quickly sinks straight down to the bottom.

    If we hammer this piece of iron into a thin sheet and make a hollow iron box, the volume of the box would be 7.8 cubic centimeters. When placed in water, it will displace 7.8 cubic centimeters of water, which weighs 7.8 grams, so the buoyant force is 7.8 grams. At the same time, the weight of the iron box is still 7.8 grams. The gravitational force and the buoyant force exactly cancel each other out, so when this iron box is placed in water, it is as if it is just a block of water and will not float on the surface.

    If we hammer this piece of iron into an even thinner sheet and make a hollow iron box with a volume of 15.6 cubic centimeters. Now, if we force this iron box to immerse in water, it can displace 15.6 cubic centimeters of water, which is equivalent to a buoyant force of 15.6 grams. However, the downward gravitational force of the iron box is only 7.8 grams, while the upward buoyant force is 15.6 grams. Subtracting the two, the buoyant force is greater than the gravitational force, so the iron box will float to the surface, until half of it is exposed above the water and half is still submerged. In this way, the buoyant force and gravitational force are exactly equal, so the iron box floats on the surface, neither rising nor sinking. The same principle applies to ships floating on the water.

    If we add two grams of weight into this iron box, then it will continue to sink, sinking to the extent of displacing two more cubic centimeters of water. That is, the buoyant force of the water must increase by two more grams to offset the newly added two grams of weight. Conversely, if we find that the iron box has sunk by two cubic centimeters of volume, we can infer that two grams of weight have been added to the inside of the iron box. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the new items added to the iron box from the volume the iron box continues to sink by, or in other words, the volume of water that is continuously displaced.

    If Cao Chong had understood this method, then after the elephant got off the boat, he would only need to calculate how much volume the boat had sunk by, or how much volume the water had been displaced by, and he wouldn't have needed to go to the trouble of carrying stones and weighing them to know the weight of the elephant.

    (Note) Centimeters are also called "gongfen," one centimeter equals 0.3 "shi cun." Grams are also called "gongfen," 500 grams equals one "shi jin."

　　曹冲称象
　　吴观周
    汉末，有人赠送一只大象给皇帝。丞相曹操想知道这只象的重量，但没有这样大的秤可以来称它，大臣们也束手无策。当时曹冲的年纪还小，他却想出了一个办法：先把象装入船中，看船舷吃水到什么地方，做上一个记号。然后把象牵回岸上，用石块装到船里去，使吃水的深度到做记号的地方。称一称石块，计算出的总重量，就是象的重量了。
    曹冲巧妙地利用了水的浮力和平衡法。
    其实，还有一个简便的办法，那就是利用“阿基米德定律”。这个定律是在三国以前几百年希腊哲学家阿基米德所发明的。可惜当时交通阻塞，文化没有交流，人们还不知道。
    现在我们就来解释一下阿基米德定律：
    一立方厘米的水，在摄氏零度时的重量是一克（注）。一立方厘米的铁，它的重量是七点八克。体积相同，铁比水重。把这块铁放在水里，水对它是有浮力的。浮力是多少呢？一克。根据阿基米德定律：“浸于液体中的物体受有浮力，此力等于该物体所排开的液体的重量。”现在铁的体积是一立方厘米，所以它排开的水也是一立方厘米。一立方厘米的水重一克，故浮力是一克。
    七点八克是这块铁的重量，也就是这块铁的重力，重力是笔直向下的，而浮力的方向是笔直向上的。这两种作用力的方向，正好相反，因此要互相抵消。七点八克减去一克，还剩六点八克，这就是铁在水中的重量。由于重力大过浮力，铁块就很快地笔直往下，沉入水底了。
    如果我们把这块铁打成薄片，做成一个空心铁盒子，盒子的体积是七点八立方厘米。把它放在水里，它就排开了七点八立方厘米的水，这些水是七点八克重，所以浮力是七点八克。同时，铁盒子的重量仍是七点八克，重力跟浮力正好互相抵消，所以这个铁盒子放入水中，好像本身就是一块方方的水，不会浮到水面上来。
    如果我们把这块铁打成更薄的片，做成十五点六立方厘米的空心铁盒子。现在强迫这个铁盒子浸入水中，它可以排开十五点六立方厘米的水，也就是有十五点六克的浮力。可是这个铁盒子笔直往下的重力只有七点八克，而笔直向上的浮力倒有十五点六克。两者相减，浮力大于重力，铁盒子就上浮到水面，直到一半露出在水面上，一半仍浸在水面下为止。这样，浮力和重力正好相等，所以铁盒子一半浮在水面上，既不再上浮，也不再下沉了。船舰浮在水面上，也是这个道理。
    如果在这个铁盒子里，再放入两克重的东西，那末它就要继续下沉，下沉的程度是再排开两立方厘米的水。就是要水的浮力再增大两克，来抵消新添两克的重力。反过来，如果我们发见了铁盒子又沉下了两个立方厘米的体积，就可以推知铁盒子里面又增加了两克重的东西。所以我们可以从铁盒子继续下沉的体积，或者说水被继续排开的体积来计算铁盒子里面新添东西的重量。
    曹冲如果懂得这个方法，那么只要在象下船以后，计算船又继续沉下了多少体积，或者说水又被继续排开了多少体积，就不必再费许多功夫来搬运石头和称就可以知道象的重量了。
    （注）厘米也叫做公分，一厘米等于0.3市寸。克也叫做公分，500克等于一市斤。
