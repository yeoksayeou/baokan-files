　　Reading "Red Glow Over Kladno"
　　Su Fang
    Red Kladno, the steel city of Czechoslovakia. Geographically, it is far from us; in our hearts, however, it is so close. Because from Comrade Zápotocký's "Red Glow Over Kladno," we understand the glorious history of Kladno, and we know the heroic and indomitable people of Kladno!
    Due to the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution, from 1918 to 1921, Czechoslovakia launched a struggle to establish a socialist republic and a revolutionary workers' party. During this period, the people of Kladno always stood at the forefront of the struggle, at the very center of the battle line, drawing the attention of the entire working class to them and incurring the anger and hatred of the entire bourgeoisie. "Red Glow Over Kladno" is a factual record of this important stage of the Czechoslovak workers' movement. It depicts the magnificent and epic scenes of the workers' movement, expresses the Kladno people's soaring and unyielding fighting will, and also exposes the bourgeoisie's despicable shamelessness. As an active participant and leader of the workers' movement, the author's clear love and hate and firm political stance are infused throughout the lines, making those seemingly simple and ordinary words full of fiery heat, burning us, exciting us, and invigorating us!
    The book also writes about some tragic facts—how deeply the working people were oppressed and exploited by the bourgeoisie. Particularly unbearable is the following example: Sixteen-year-old Lucy, the daughter of a deceased worker, had to exchange her body for flour with the miller in order to provide for her sick mother and young siblings! However, even so, it does not bring us a feeling of sadness, but a passion of incomparable anger. The author's strong hatred for the bourgeois exploiters is so truly embodied in the people he describes as humiliated and harmed, allowing us to clearly see Lucy's and all the working people's heartfelt hatred for the exploiters; and the miller's image in our minds is not that of a human being, but a shameful beast! At the same time, not long after, we see a different fate for another girl—Annie. Annie was spotted by a farm manager, who forced her mother to send her to work for him as a handyman, attempting to take the opportunity to insult her; but her mother insisted on sending her elsewhere. Although the manager threatened the old woman with dismissal, she did not yield. Because she knew she was not isolated and helpless, that the broad masses stood with her, and that the union would support her. By connecting these two events, it can be fully proved that the tragedy that occurred to Lucy will not continue. The working class is awakening, and they will never willingly be humiliated forever.
    Yes, the working class is not willing to be humiliated forever. The massive workers' movement is like a boiling torrent, rising and falling, surging forward; and this is precisely the main thread running through the entire book. The author's pen is dipped in enthusiasm to praise the invincible ranks of the working class and to depict the vigorous development of the workers' movement. We will never forget the scene of the May Day parade and demonstration recorded in the book: People participating in the parade came from all directions, including workers, youth, women, and even soldiers. People gathered together to swear: to follow the beacon fire of the Russian revolution forever without compromise! Red flags and red headscarves on women's heads were mixed together, like flowers blooming everywhere... This situation vividly demonstrates the unprecedented unity of the Czechoslovak people and the high tide of the workers' movement! At the same time, the author wrote about the mood of the exploiters in a mocking and satirical tone. They were unwilling to see these people "fooling around," covered their heads and slept soundly; they cursed these people with vicious language and prayed to God for peace and tranquility. However, do not all these show their inner emptiness and cowardice, do not all these show that they have reached the end of their days?!
    The struggle is arduous, and the author does not avoid it. However, in the fire, true gold can show its value even more. Although the book describes the shamelessness of traitors and the ferocity of the bourgeois government, it also further sets off the noble qualities of the people of Kladno, who cannot be subdued by violence. This point is particularly evident at the end of the book. The book ends with the arrest of a large number of revolutionaries and the founding of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. The author particularly focuses on writing about the situation after the revolutionaries were arrested and imprisoned. The people in the prison are still full of vitality and still use various methods to strike at the reactionary rulers; the people outside the prison, even women and young lads, are not discouraged and persist in revolutionary activities. The people of Kladno are people with a high degree of revolutionary optimism. They firmly believe that the future belongs to them, and victory belongs to them.
    Yes, victory belongs to these heroic people, and the establishment of the Communist Party is the prelude to victory. The red glow will never disappear, and the red glow will forever shine over Kladno!

### 读“红光照耀着克拉德诺”

　　读“红光照耀着克拉德诺”
　　苏方
    红色的克拉德诺，捷克斯洛伐克的钢铁的城。在地域上，它离我们很远；在心灵上，它却和我们如此接近。因为从萨波托斯基同志所写的“红光照耀着克拉德诺”之中，我们了解了克拉德诺的光荣的历史，我们认识了英勇顽强的克拉德诺人！
    由于伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响，1918至1921年间，捷克斯洛伐克国内展开了为建立一个社会主义共和国和革命的工人党的斗争。在这个时期内，克拉德诺人始终挺立在斗争的最前列，站在战线的最中心，使得整个工人阶级的注意力都转向他们，也使得整个资产阶级的愤怒和仇恨都针对着他们。“红光照耀着克拉德诺”便是捷克斯洛伐克工人运动的这个重要阶段的记实。其中描绘了工人运动的波澜壮阔的伟大场面，表现了克拉德诺人昂扬不屈的斗争意志，也揭露了资产阶级的卑鄙无耻。作为工人运动的积极参加者和领导者，作者的鲜明的爱憎和坚定的政治立场，也处处融注在字里行间，使得那些看来极为朴素、极其平凡的字句，充满了火一样的热力，燃烧着我们，使我们激动，使我们振奋！
    书中也写了一些悲惨的事实——劳动人民受着资产阶级多么深重的压榨和剥削，其中特别令人难以忍受的是这样的事例：十六岁的露茜，一个已死的工人的女儿，为了生病的母亲和幼小的弟妹，不得不被迫用自己的身体去跟磨坊主交换面粉！然而，即使这样，它带给我们的也不是悲戚的感觉，而是无比愤怒的激情。作者对于资产阶级剥削者的强烈的憎恨，那样真切地体现在他所描写的被侮辱被损害的人的身上，使我们清楚地看到了露茜和所有劳苦人民对于剥削者切齿痛恨的内心情感；而磨坊主在我们心目中产生的印象，也不是人而是一个可耻的畜牲！同时，不久以后，我们又看到了另一个女孩子——安妮的不同的命运。安妮被一个农场经理看中了，他强迫她的母亲把她送到他那里去做杂工，企图趁机侮辱她；但是她的母亲却坚持把她送到别处去了。虽然经理用解雇来威胁这个老妇人，她也没有屈服。因为她知道自己不是孤立无依的，广大群众和自己站在一起，工会也会支持自己。把这两件事联系在一起来看，便可以充分证明：在露茜身上产生过的悲剧是不会继续下去的。工人阶级正在觉醒，他们绝不甘永远受辱。
    是的，工人阶级是不甘永远受辱的。声势浩大的工人运动，已像一股沸腾的巨流，起伏着，澎湃着；而这也正是贯串全书的主脉。作者的笔尖蘸满了热情来歌颂工人阶级不可战胜的队伍，来描绘工人运动的蓬勃开展。我们永远不会忘记书中记叙的五一节游行示威的场面：参加游行的人从四方八面涌来，有工人，有青年，有妇女，甚至还有军人。人们聚集在一起宣誓：永远不妥协地跟着俄国革命的烽火前进！红旗和妇女头上的红头巾混在一起，像鲜花四处烂开……这种情况，多么鲜明地表现出捷克斯洛伐克人民的空前团结，以及工人运动浪潮的高涨啊！与此同时，作者又以嘲弄讽刺的笔调写出了剥削者的心情，他们不愿看这些人“胡闹”，蒙起头睡大觉；他们用恶毒的语言咒骂这些人，向上帝祈求着和平和安宁。然而所有这些，不都表明了他们内心的空虚和怯懦，不都表明了他们已到了日暮穷途的境地了么？！
    斗争是艰苦的，作者没有回避它。然而在烈火中，真正的金子才更能显出它的价值。虽然这里描写了叛徒的无耻和资产阶级政府的狞恶，但是也更加衬托出暴力所不能屈服的克拉德诺人的崇高品质。这一点，在全书结尾处表现得特别明显。全书结束在大批革命者被捕入狱和捷克斯洛伐克共产党成立的时候。作者特别着力地写出了革命者被捕入狱后的情形。在监狱里的人，仍然生气勃勃，仍然通过各种办法打击反动统治者；在监狱外的人，哪怕是妇女和年青小伙子，也毫不气馁，坚持着革命活动。克拉德诺人是具有高度革命乐观主义精神的人，他们深信未来是他们的，胜利是他们的。
    是的，胜利是属于这些英雄的人们的，共产党的成立便是胜利的先声。红光永远不会消失，红光永远辉耀在克拉德诺上空！
