Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 14th: The Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association held an evening party in Moscow on the 13th to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

More than 300 people attended the evening party, including representatives of scientists, cultural and artistic circles, and students from Moscow. Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and staff members of the embassy also attended the party.

The evening party was presided over by Andreev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. In his opening remarks, he said that the great October Revolution laid the foundation for a brand new relationship between the people of all countries, and the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is an outstanding example of this relationship. This treaty is based on the principles of equality and mutual respect for national interests, fraternal mutual assistance, non-interference in internal affairs, and complete loyalty to the cause of proletarian internationalism.

Andreev pointed out that the establishment of fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and China has played a huge role in the political, economic and cultural development of our two peoples.

He said that in the past eight years, the Soviet Union has made tremendous achievements on the road of socialist construction, in developing industry, agriculture, cultural undertakings, and in improving the material conditions of the Soviet people. During this period, the situation in the People's Republic of China has also undergone fundamental changes. The greatest victory of the People's China is the victorious introduction of agriculture onto the road of socialist development, and at the same time, a real cultural revolution is being carried out throughout the country.

The Soviet people are heartily delighted by these historically significant victories won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet Union has given its loyal ally, the People's Republic of China, its full assistance in helping it build China into a powerful industrialized socialist power, and will continue to provide such assistance in the future.

Andreev said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the development of close friendship between the two countries, as well as their complete agreement on peaceful foreign policy, have been and will continue to be of great significance not only for maintaining peace in the Far East, but also for maintaining world peace. The spiritual and political unity of the great Chinese and Soviet peoples is growing stronger. This friendship and close cooperation is accelerating the pace at which the people of the Soviet Union and China are moving forward.

Andreev said that the people of China and the Soviet Union are joining hands and marching towards a common goal—a communist society. No force can undermine this ever-strengthening unity and friendship. Let those imperialist gentlemen who are losing and have lost world hegemony indulge in fabricating tricks about disagreements between socialist countries in every possible way, all in vain. The friendship between the people of all countries that have embarked on the road of socialism will develop and consolidate regardless of all this.

Subsequently, the Soviet composer Muradeli, Deputy Doctor of Medicine Burkina, and the chairman of a collective farm in the Moscow region, Lyukshin, who had visited China, spoke at the meeting about their impressions of visiting China.

Finally, artists from the Soviet Union and China performed programs.

A few days ago, evening parties celebrating the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship were also held at the Moscow Central Journalists' House and the Smolensk Children's Palace. (Attached picture)

    亲密友谊使中苏人民加速向前迈进
    莫斯科盛会庆祝中苏条约签订八周年
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联对外文化协会和苏中友好协会13日在莫斯科举行晚会，庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订八周年。
    参加晚会的有莫斯科的科学家、文化艺术界代表和学生代表三百多人。中国驻苏联大使刘晓和大使馆工作人员也出席了晚会。
    晚会由苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫主持。他在致开幕词中说，伟大的十月革命奠定了各国人民之间一种崭新的关系，苏中友好同盟互助条约的签定就是这种关系的卓越范例。这个条约是建立在平等和互相尊重民族利益的原则、兄弟般的互助、互不干涉内政和完全忠实于无产阶级国际主义事业的基础上的。
    安德烈耶夫指出，苏中两国兄弟关系的建立对于我们两国人民的政治、经济和文化的发展起了巨大的作用。
    他说，八年来，苏联在社会主义建设的道路上，在发展工业、农业、文化事业和在改善苏联人民的物质状况方面，取得了巨大的成就。在这一时期，中华人民共和国的情况也有了根本的改变。人民中国最伟大的胜利是胜利地把农业引上社会主义发展的道路，同时，还在全国进行真正的文化革命。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党领导下所获得的这些有历史意义的胜利，使苏联人民感到衷心的喜悦。苏联给了自己忠实的盟友中华人民共和国以全力的援助，帮助它把中国建设成为一个强大的工业化的社会主义强国，今后仍将继续提供这种援助。
    安德烈耶夫说，苏中条约的签订，两国亲密友谊的发展，在和平外交政策方面的完全一致，过去和将来不仅对维护远东和平，而且对维护世界和平都具有重大意义。伟大的中苏两国人民在精神和政治上的一致日益加强。这种友谊和紧密合作加速了苏中两国人民向前迈进的速度。
    安德烈耶夫说，中苏两国人民正在携手走向一个共同的目标——共产主义社会。任何力量都不能破坏这种日益巩固的团结和友谊。让那些正在丧失和已经丧失了世界霸权的帝国主义先生们，在千方百计徒劳无益地捏造关于社会主义国家意见分歧的把戏中去自我陶醉吧。已经走上社会主义道路的各国人民之间的友谊，将不顾这一切而日益发展和巩固。
    接着，曾经到中国访问过的苏联作曲家穆拉杰利、医学副博士布尔基纳和莫斯科州一个集体农庄的主席柳克申等人先后在会上谈到了他们访问中国的观感。
    最后，苏中两国的艺术家表演了节目。
    前几天，在莫斯科中央记者之家和斯摩棱斯克少年宫也举行了庆祝中苏友好条约签订八周年的晚会。（附图片）
