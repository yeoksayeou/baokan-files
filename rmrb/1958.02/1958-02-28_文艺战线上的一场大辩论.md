In the nationwide struggle against the bourgeois rightists, the literary circle exposed and criticized the anti-party cliques of Ding Ling and Chen Qingxian, as well as other rightist elements, and achieved great victories. This was a major struggle between right and wrong on the literary front, a struggle between the socialist literary line and the anti-socialist literary line. This struggle reflects the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road in the literary domain.

Literature is a barometer of the times. Whenever there is a dramatic change in the class struggle, it can be seen on this barometer.

The struggle between socialism and capitalism is long-term and fluctuating. Each intense struggle is a severe test and tempering for the working class. No matter how tortuous and difficult the road may be, the final outcome of the struggle will always be the victory of the revolution over the counter-revolution, the victory of new things and new ideas over old things and old ideas. The entire society develops in this way, and literature develops in the same way. The historical tide is irresistible. The reactionaries are doomed to failure. The cause of socialism, the cause of socialist literature, will inevitably triumph over all reactionary forces and obstacles.

**I. Trials in the Storm**

In the past year or two, both internationally and domestically, there have been a series of major extraordinary events. In 1956, China completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, which was a major change in Chinese history. The productive relations changed, and the productive forces were liberated. The broad masses of workers and peasants were elated. The bourgeoisie, however, did not like this change due to their class nature. Those who were sensible among them tried to adapt to this situation; they saw that only by reforming themselves could they have a bright future in the new society. However, the rightist bourgeoisie and their representatives in the intellectual circle were not willing to do so. They refused to give up the system of exploitation and the ideology of exploitation, despised the new socialist system, and yearned for the old capitalist system, hoping for a capitalist restoration in China. Everything that won the praise of the people, they found fault with. They felt that everything was "not as good as before," like the old woman with nine pounds of rice, always feeling that the world was getting worse and worse. The old economic base they relied on was being eliminated, but they were unwilling to rely on the new economic base. They looked down on the workers and peasants but could not help feeling their strength. This is the fundamental reason for the spiritual turmoil and instability of some bourgeois intellectuals and why they seize the opportunity to attack the people whenever there is a breeze or a rustle of grass. Therefore, to consolidate and develop the socialist system and make the socialist superstructure adapt to the base, it is necessary and inevitable to carry out a socialist revolution in politics and ideology.

Domestic and foreign reactionaries always look for opportunities to attack socialism. Whenever the Communist Party corrects its mistakes, rectifies its style, and conducts open criticism and self-criticism, the reactionaries think that their time to attack has come. Imperialists used the criticism of Stalin by the Soviet Communist Party's 20th Congress to stir up an anti-Soviet, anti-communist tide internationally. The peak of this reactionary wave was the Hungarian incident. How to deal with the Hungarian incident became an important criterion for measuring whether a person is a true communist and a true revolutionary. The vast majority of communists around the world demonstrated their loyalty and firmness to the international communist movement at this critical moment. However, there were also many who could not stand the test. Their thoughts became confused, and their political stance wavered. A few even openly betrayed the cause. This phenomenon was particularly prominent among some progressive intellectuals in the West. American writer Howard Fast was a shameful traitor. In his statement of resignation from the party, he lamented, "The faith I built up in my life has been completely shattered." This is the confession of all traitors throughout history. Obviously, what was shattered was only the thin layer of Marxism he wore, not the true faith in socialism; his soul was deeply permeated with the corrupt ideology of bourgeois liberalism. Such people leaving the ranks of the working class is not a bad thing but a good thing.

The Party Central Committee issued two documents, "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Again," analyzing new problems in the international communist movement, pointing out the two kinds of contradictions in socialist society, and thus clarifying some ideological confusion within and outside the Party. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's correct policy of handling contradictions among the people, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and the subsequent directive to launch a rectification movement throughout the Party have played an immeasurable role in consolidating and developing China's socialist system.

However, the anti-socialist elements in the intellectual circle were encouraged by the international anti-communist tide. Since the spring of 1956, especially after the Hungarian incident, they could no longer hold back their impatience. They interpreted the correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" according to their subjective wishes. Originally, we advocated the free debate of different opinions in academia and the free competition of different styles in art to develop socialist culture. We will long-term and unwaveringly implement this policy. We believe that monopoly, exclusivity, lack of competition, and lack of comparison will not lead science and art to prosperity but will only lead to their decline. We believe that the working class has the power to defeat the bourgeoisie in culture and art through free competition and free debate. The rightist bourgeoisie, however, interpreted "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" as a negation of the Marxist ideological movement. They were very dissatisfied with the ideological remolding movement. They said that the "severe winter" would "thaw," and "spring" was about to come. Their purpose was not to promote academic debate and artistic competition but to use this slogan to stir up a political tide against socialism. Therefore, when our Party began to enter the rectification movement and widely mobilized the masses to express their opinions, they thought that the time had come to reform the Communist Party in their own image. Their first target was the ideological and cultural field. They were eager to seize the ideological position, which they thought was relatively weak and easy to break through. Then, they launched a full-scale attack on the entire socialist cause. In a certain sense, this was not a bad thing for us but a good thing. The rightists exposed their true colors and educated the people from the opposite side.

To take the socialist road or the capitalist road? To be a revolutionary or a reactionary? This is a pressing issue that requires a choice from every Chinese person. In the democratic revolutionary stage, whoever opposed imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism was a revolutionary. Now we have entered the socialist revolutionary stage. To be a revolutionary, one must oppose capitalism and take the socialist road. If you want to take the capitalist road, you are a reactionary. One must choose between the two. There is no middle road.

For Chinese intellectuals, passing the socialist test is much more serious than passing the democratic revolutionary test.

Indeed, in the intellectual and literary circles, many rightists emerged, some of whom were Communist Party members. They played an active role in colluding with the rightists outside the Party to attack the Party. Zhong Dianhua's "The Drums of Cinema" (published in the December 1956 issue of "Literary Gazette") was one of the earliest signals of the rightist attack. This article completely denied the achievements of the film industry since liberation, maliciously attacked the Party's leadership of literary work, and attempted to drag the film industry back to the old capitalist road.

During this period, revisionist thoughts began to rise in the literary circle. Rightist elements and revisionists opposed the line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism. They said that "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" had become "outdated." The principles of socialist realism should be modified or abandoned. Under the slogans of "writing reality" and "intervening in life," they advocated "exposing the dark side of life," believing that only in this way could they find a "new path of realism." For a time, it was indeed "the wind before the rain, the hall filled with wind." The literary wind was blowing to the right. Seeing this phenomenon, some "left" dogmatists panicked and wanted to suppress this perverse trend with simple and brutal methods. Of course, dogmatism and suppression methods cannot overcome revisionism. Dogmatists were afraid of letting people speak out because they did not believe in the power of the working class and the people, nor did they believe in the power of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, their superficial "leftism" actually reflected their "rightism" at the core. The Party resolutely adopted the policy of letting them speak out, because they fought for the right to speak out, went crazy, and wanted to swallow the Communist Party in one breath. They completely lost their reason. They betrayed socialism, betrayed the constitution, and betrayed their own promises. The Party had long since made it clear that we are not afraid of poisonous weeds; we will uproot them and turn them into fertilizer. We are not afraid of ghosts and monsters; we will invite them to be the people's negative teachers. We saw that the poisonous weeds had grown, so let them grow. Because poisonous weeds are an objective existence, the growth of poisonous weeds signifies that the working class's weeding team is about to march out. To cover up the existing poisonous weeds with mud and soil, not allowing them to show their heads, or to suppress them with simple methods as soon as they show their heads, is a stupid and unwise strategy that does not understand the strategy of class struggle and will definitely leave trouble for the future, requiring more labor to uproot them later. The Party believes that the people have the power to identify and overcome poisonous weeds. The Party knows how to deal with class enemies. In this way, the rightist elements in the literary circle, like the rightist elements in other circles, exposed their true colors, bared their fangs and claws, and began to act, forming a confrontation between the two sides. Both sides were happy. The rightists, or reactionaries, were happy because they thought the Communist Party was about to collapse, and capitalism could be restored. The revolutionaries were happy because the ghosts and monsters had come out, and they had the opportunity to eliminate them.

The rightist elements dreamed of a repeat of the Hungarian incident in China. Just as the Hungarian reactionaries used the banners of Kossuth and Petofi as weapons for their counter-revolutionary activities, the Chinese rightists also used the Party's rectification movement to incite a so-called "new May Fourth Movement" against socialism in 1957. At this time, as Li Yuren described, Ding Ling's eyes were shining with joy. Feng Xuefeng's mood had never been so excited. He incited all those who were dissatisfied with the Party and the people's government to "seek revenge if wronged, seek revenge if resentful," using the "stormy" style of "great democracy" to oppose the Party and the state's leadership. Even Chen Yong, who usually did not care much about worldly affairs, said, "The night before the great change has arrived." Zhong Dianhua later admitted in his self-criticism, "My mind experienced a Hungarian incident." This was a genuine confession. Therefore, the collusion between the rightists inside and outside the Party was very natural. The Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian anti-party clique and the rightists of the "Wenhui Daily" communicated secretly, intending to use the "Wenhui Daily" to openly support them to achieve their goal of splitting the literary circle and overthrowing the Party's leadership. Ai Qing played a role in connecting them. Feng Xuefeng became the rightists' backer at the People's Literature Publishing House. The Jiang Feng anti-party clique cooperated closely with the rightists in the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Democratic League, reaching the level of "merging parties and leagues." These people, who claimed to be Communist Party members, did not stand up to defend the interests of the working class when the working class's cause was attacked by the enemy but instead colluded with the enemy to attack the Party. What else could this be called if not betrayal?

The anti-party activities of Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, Feng Xuefeng, and others were not just beginning now. Fifteen years ago, when the revolution was in its most difficult days, the world was facing the slavery of fascism, Hitler's army had occupied a large part of Soviet territory, Yan'an was heavily besieged by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the people and army in the enemy-occupied areas were fighting the most brutal battles with the Japanese invaders, it was at this time that Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, and others in Yan'an colluded with Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, and other bad elements, publishing a series of anti-party articles such as "Wild Lily" and "Reflections on March 8th" in the newspapers and magazines they edited, shooting at the revolution from behind. These articles quickly received the applause of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the same time, Feng Xuefeng supported the Hu Feng clique in the Kuomintang-controlled area, spreading anti-party and anti-Marxist poison. They chose the same time in different regions, responding to each other, and attacking the Party. This incident illustrates a historical law: when the class struggle reaches a sharp stage, and the revolution is at a turning point, there will always be a group of class alien elements and unsteady elements within the Party who cannot stand the test in the storm and expose their true colors.

Fifteen years ago was a turning point in history. The Battle of Stalingrad turned the world situation around. Our Party's first rectification movement laid the foundation for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Fifteen years later, today is another turning point in history. The anti-Soviet, anti-communist tide, which reached its peak with the Hungarian incident, was repelled. Socialist countries and communist parties around the world showed unprecedented unity and strength. The Soviet Union's achievements in science and technology took the lead in the world. Our Party launched the second rectification movement and successfully crushed the rightist attack, making the socialist revolution achieve decisive victory. At the two historical turning points and in the two rectification movements of our Party, Ding Ling and others played the role of anti-party elements twice, which was not accidental.

This time, the rightists in the literary circle set fire to the scene, and the flames were even more fierce than fifteen years ago. However, the revolutionary forces today are far from comparable to fifteen years ago. The arsonists ended up burning themselves. The anti-party faces of Ding Ling and others were finally and thoroughly exposed.

Through the great debate against the rightists, we all, including myself, received a very profound education. The vast majority of writers and artists stood more firmly on the side of socialism. Socialist enthusiasm surged in the literary circle. Rightist elements have no way out unless they thoroughly repent and start anew; there is no other way out. The Party and the people are willing to help them reform, but it mainly depends on their own efforts.

**II. Two Incompatible Worldviews**

Some people may ask: Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng are old Party members and old left-wing writers. How did they degenerate into rightist elements? What lessons can we learn from their incidents?

Looking back at the road we have traveled. Many of us come from declining feudal landlord or other exploiting classes in terms of upbringing and worldview. The May Fourth New Culture Movement brought us science and democracy and also brought us the new trend of socialism. At that time, we eagerly absorbed all the new knowledge from abroad, and for a while, we could not distinguish the boundaries between anarchism and socialism, individualism and collectivism. Nietzsche, Kropotkin, and Marx were almost equally attractive to us at that time. Later, we recognized that Marxism-Leninism is the only truth and weapon for liberating humanity. We devoted ourselves to the cause of liberating the working class, but the bourgeois individualist thoughts, emotions, and habits in our minds did not fundamentally change. We had an abstract belief in communism, but the actions we took were often driven by individual heroism. We did not integrate with the workers and peasants; we rarely approached them. Democratic revolution was our immediate demand, while socialist revolution was still an ideal. At that time, many of us were more like small-bourgeois revolutionary democrats than proletarian revolutionaries. The influence of individualism on us was difficult to shake off for a long time. Looking back, individualism was once associated with concepts such as "individual liberation" and "personal independence," giving us encouragement in our struggle against feudal oppression and for freedom. Many outstanding works of 19th-century European literature often describe the conflict between the individual and society, indignation at the world, lone struggle, and anarchist rebellion, which left a deep impression on our minds. We enthusiastically welcomed Ibsen and admired his famous saying, "The loneliest person in the world is the strongest." Many of us walked the revolutionary path through individual struggle, carrying the baggage of individualism to join the revolution.

Bourgeois individualism and proletarian collectivism are irreconcilable. We not only need to carry out the bourgeois democratic revolution (this revolution in our country can only be led by the proletariat), but also need to carry out the socialist revolution. The bourgeois individualist thoughts in us have become the biggest obstacle on our path forward.

On the issue of bourgeois individualism, the attitudes of two kinds of people are completely different: one kind of people, through long-term revolutionary struggles, party education, actual struggle tempering, and self-reform, gradually become collectivist warriors. They are determined to throw off the baggage of individualism, reform their thoughts, and are determined to serve the collective interests of the proletariat. Their thoughts and emotions have undergone a revolutionary transformation from one class to another. Throwing off the baggage of individualism is not easy. They often throw it off only after hitting the wall and falling down. After throwing off the baggage, they feel light and happy. They can integrate with the collective and be of one heart with the Party. They find infinite strength in the collective. In this way, they naturally and rightly subordinate personal interests to collective interests. From then on, they can be loyal to the people's cause in any situation. Another kind of people, however, is not like this. They never throw off the baggage of individualism, entangled in personal gains and losses, personal grudges; even after hitting the wall and falling down, they still do not want to throw off the baggage, but carry it even heavier. They do not want to reform themselves according to the spirit of collectivism but always want to reform the Party and our revolutionary cause according to the image of individualism. They put themselves at the center of everything and are incompatible with the collective, not of one heart with the Party. They are self-satisfied with a little achievement, and when they make mistakes and are criticized, they are full of resentment. They cannot stand any serious test. At critical moments, they do not hesitate to betray the working class.

In our Party, the first kind of people and those who are willing to strive to be the first kind of people make up the majority. But the second kind of people is not few. Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng belong to the second kind of people. At the expanded meeting of the Party group of the Writers' Association in 1955, I once said that the most important thing for a Communist Party member is loyalty to the Party. Ding Ling was very resentful of this sentence; she angrily questioned me during the big outburst in 1957 why I had to talk about "loyalty." Ding Ling knew it in her heart. She was originally a thief, afraid to hear the word "loyalty." Ding Ling is a thorough individualist, a person who has always been disloyal to the Party.

Many comrades mentioned "The Diary of Miss Sophie." To understand Ding Ling's character and thoughts, reading her famous work from thirty years ago can be very helpful. The protagonist of the book is a terrible nihilistic individualist. She lies, deceives, and plays with men, taking pleasure in others' pain and using her life as a toy. This character, although appearing in the guise of a rebel against old ethics, is actually an incarnation of the decadent tendencies of a declining class. Of course, a writer can depict various social types; the question is what attitude the author takes towards the characters they depict. Obviously, Ding Ling described this character that should be negated with great sympathy. If this novel reflects her early thoughts, then after joining the Party for a long time, especially after living in the revolutionary base area for a few years, she wrote works like "When I Was in Xiacun" and "In the Hospital," which shows that her extreme individualist thoughts not only did not improve but developed to the point of sharp conflict with the working class and the laboring masses. The novel "When I Was in Xiacun" glorifies a woman who was taken away by the Japanese invaders to be a camp prostitute as a goddess. It is noteworthy that Feng Xuefeng, in the "Afterword to Ding Ling's Collected Works," said that the "soul" described by the author was so "rich and brilliant and great." This shows how similar their tastes are. Ding Ling's "In the Hospital," written in 1941, more concentratedly expresses her hostility towards the working class and the laboring people. This novel is a microcosm of Ding Ling's extreme individualist reactionary worldview. The novel describes a young female Communist Party member, Lu Ping, who has serious anti-party sentiments, as a heroine of the new society, just because the organization did not satisfy her unrealistic fantasies when allocating work, the author could not help but sympathize with her protagonist, cursing the needs of the Party and the revolution as an "iron hoop" around the neck. In the case of conflict between personal interests and collective interests, Lu Ping looks at everything in Yan'an with enmity and carries out a series of anti-party activities in the hospital. The novel portrays the laboring masses in the revolutionary base area as stupid and numb people, depicts Yan'an as a cruel, merciless, and terrifying place, and portrays the revolutionary cadres in Yan'an from top to bottom as hopeless. Therefore, the author supports her female protagonist in "fighting" with everyone. Ding Ling wrote, "She sought revenge, looking for gaps to attack everywhere, she criticized everything. She thought hard every day about how to defeat others, she always believed that the truth was on her side." Ding Ling's novel precisely propagates her anti-party, anti-people "truth," the "truth" of extreme bourgeois individualism. From Sophie onwards, in the life experiences and personalities of many of Ding Ling's female protagonists, there are shadows of the author herself. She admires Sophie-like women very much. Her admiration for the notorious rightist Lin Xiling is not accidental. She praises this type of woman as the most lovable and strong-willed character. It can be said that for many years, the spirit of Miss Sophie has always been attached to Ding Ling, only later she wore the clothes of a communist, making her appearance not so easy to recognize, and her harm was even greater.

Stubborn individualists, in revolutionary struggles, become very fragile when facing serious tests. Ding Ling's surrender to the Kuomintang in Nanjing in 1933, turning from a prisoner of the secret police to their guest, betraying the Communist Party and the working class, is a manifestation of her fragility. Later, Ding Ling went to Yan'an, hiding this part of her history, and deceiving the Party's trust. In 1942, she published articles like "Reflections on March 8th," colluding with Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, and others to oppose the Party, showing great stubbornness. This can be said to be a continuation and development of her betrayal of the Party. The Party fought resolutely against her. However, when she expressed her willingness to correct her mistakes, the Party still tried to save her and encouraged her to go to the masses to reform herself. "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" was written under the Party's help.

The liberation of the whole country and a book "On the Sanggan River" brought Ding Ling fame and status. In the first one or two years after liberation, she did some work. But her individualism also developed. She forgot the Party's criticism and education, becoming arrogant and unruly. She used the positions entrusted by the Party and the people to cultivate her own clique, attempting to realize her ambition to dominate the literary world. She, Chen Qingxian, and Feng Xuefeng turned the "Literary Gazette" they edited at that time into an independent kingdom. In 1954, the Party and the literary circle checked the mistakes in the work of the "Literary Gazette," which greatly angered them. Their "kingdom" was untouchable. From then on, they harbored resentment. Their anti-party clique's activities became more and more blatant. The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng also regarded them as a force that could be won over for cooperation. In 1955, the Party group of the Writers' Association exposed Ding Ling and Chen Qingxian's anti-party activities and fought against them uncompromisingly. At that time, they made self-criticisms that they later called "insincere." As Chen Qingxian confessed, they were full of "mad revenge." When the rightists attacked, their anti-party activities reached their peak.

This is Ding Ling's performance in the three periods of Nanjing, Yan'an, and Beijing, at every important historical juncture.

Now let's look at Feng Xuefeng's political and ideological development from history. Feng Xuefeng also did some work for the revolution, but his deep individualism, anarchism, and proletarian collectivism, and the Party's organizational discipline often conflicted. Feng Xuefeng summarized his relationship with the Party in his self-criticism with two sentences: "When successful, the individual is above the Party; when unsuccessful, the individual is outside the Party." In 1936, he came from the revolutionary base area of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia to Shanghai, appearing in the guise of an envoy, on the one hand, he regarded Hu Feng as a comrade, on the other hand, he gave a very bad sectarian blow to the underground Party organization in Shanghai at that time, causing the split of the revolutionary literary cause. This was a big thing Feng Xuefeng did in his so-called "successful" period. In 1937, because the Party did not satisfy his personal ambition for status, he voluntarily left the Party and became a deserter of the revolution. The outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, the national enthusiasm was high, but he was alone, depressed. From then on, his so-called "unsuccessful" life began.

In 1943, Feng Xuefeng came out of the Urumqi concentration camp, but he did not become stronger. Instead, his mood was darker and more depressed. The collection of miscellaneous essays he wrote that year, titled "Village Wind and City Wind," was full of empty, lonely, pessimistic, and desperate emotions. He saw the stupidity and numbness of the people, the "slavishness and meanness of survival." He lost confidence in the entire nation. At that time, the Japanese invaders had occupied a large part of China and were carrying out slave education on Chinese soil. Feng Xuefeng advocated the "hegemonic power" of the nation at this time, advocating the "nationalization" of national culture, and propagating that national culture "can also be raped to produce offspring" (see "Hegemonic Power"). In this book, he also shamelessly propagated individualist and idealist thoughts, propagated the philosophy of feudal class "dying for one's lord" and personal ambition. He said that "dying for one's lord" is limited to "one's lord," which is "not only showing loyalty to the power one depends on but also respecting one's independent will" (see "On the Code of Chivalry and a Discussion of Zhou Zuoren"). He said, "This is a victory in our history." He also said that "the ambition of heroes is also what the ambitious scholars want to embrace, those righteousness; at the same time, the ambition of heroes, when it touches the utility of life, is indeed giving virtue a new life" (see "On the Code of Chivalry and a Discussion of Zhou Zuoren"). What kind of words are these? It is no wonder that after national liberation, Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Chen Qingxian, and others greatly developed their personal ambitions and propagated "dying for one's lord" to the youth, originally they had their reactionary philosophical basis.

In the collection of essays "Advance or Retreat" written in 1944 and 1945, Feng Xuefeng propagated the subjective fighting spirit of individualism, sang the praises of the craziness of the petty bourgeoisie, and in many places, his tone was the same as Hu Feng's. We know that Hu Feng advocated craziness and spasms. Feng Xuefeng also said that today's era and society "require madmen above madmen, require strongmen above strongmen, require the melee of madmen above madmen, require the rebellion of the strongest" (see "Going Mad"). When the Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in 1945, due to the arson of American conspirators and Nazi bandits, some places in Berlin became a sea of fire, Feng Xuefeng did not condemn the enemy's atrocities but praised the "epic-like" inferno, the "epic-like" terror. He described the victory of the Soviet army in liberating Hitler's Germany as a "really terrifying whip"; he described the liberated Berlin as the "city of human terror." This revealed his fear of the revolution and his crazy psychology. Where was there a bit of the taste of a communist? In 1944, Feng Xuefeng published an article titled "On Friendship." At that time, he had just come out of the enemy's concentration camp, but in this article, he did not show any hatred towards class enemies but emphasized the propaganda of "broad human friendship," saying that this is the only "fundamental requirement" of humans. What was even stranger was that he especially emphasized friendship and loyalty to friends, saying that even if a friend who wanted to betray the Party and join the enemy, "if you do not first advise and stop the friend or comrade, but only report his intention as if it were information to society or the organization, this may be said to be loyal to society or the organization, but to the friend or comrade, it is malicious and almost terrifying." Obviously, in his mind, there was only the interest of personal friendship, not the interest of the Party and the people. In fact, from Feng Xuefeng's words and deeds before and after, we only saw his loyalty to the bourgeoisie, but we did not see his loyalty to the proletariat; we only saw his friendship and loyalty to himself, his good friend Hu Feng, Ding Ling, and others, but we did not see his loyalty to the Party and the people. I quoted more of Feng Xuefeng's articles written in the period from 1943 to 1945 to let everyone see what the "communist" was really thinking and feeling in the months when dark clouds covered the whole world.

In 1949, when the country was liberated, Feng Xuefeng did not feel excited but felt depressed, as he himself said, he had a feeling like "being kicked aside like a small stone." It is no wonder that he looked at the victory of the revolution and everything new with a dark eye. Darkness is a psychological characteristic of individualists like Feng Xuefeng. When our country entered the stage of socialist revolution, Feng Xuefeng felt more and more resistance and disgust towards the socialist system and socialist culture. His mood became more and more depressed and more and more irritable. And when the rightists attacked, his long-suppressed anti-party emotions erupted. His combination with Ding Ling and others' anti-party activities was completely exposed.

Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng, although they have been Party members for more than twenty or thirty years, from their worldview and long-term behavior, they are actually bourgeois literary aristocrats within the Party, bourgeois individualist careerists within the Party. They are very fragile in front of the enemy but often make waves within the revolution. They refuse to reform their thoughts according to the requirements of the Party and the revolution but want to reform the Party and our society according to their bourgeois individualist image, and first of all, they want to reform the people's literary cause.

Many comrades correctly criticized Ding Ling's "one-bookism." This is very meaningful. This is a struggle between two worldviews, two fundamentally different attitudes towards the literary cause: whether to regard the literary cause as a part of the people's cause or to regard it as a means for personal gain and fame? Whether to use the former attitude, that is, communist thought, to cultivate young writers or to use the latter attitude, that is, bourgeois individualist thought, to cultivate young writers?

We hope that every writer will write good books, and not just one. Without works, what is the literary cause? But the "one-bookism" harms our literary cause, and under this kind of thought, it is impossible to produce good works. "One-bookism" regards writing books as a tool to satisfy personal desires for fame and wealth, thinking that writing one book can reach out to the people to ask for things and stand above the people. "With one book, no one can knock you down." This is their slogan. In the literary circle, such people are not few: writing one book, painting one picture, making one film, gaining a little fame, and then looking down on everything. The greater the personal fame, the smaller the position of the Party and the people in their hearts. Their thoughts and feelings are farther and farther away from the people. They feel that the people owe them a favor. They forget that honor is given to them by the people. Greed for fame and wealth and self-satisfaction are important reasons for the moral and political decline of many literary workers.

"One-bookism" regards writing books as more noble than anything else, as if works are created only by individual genius. They do not understand that any genius creation, without the current struggle of the people, without the accumulation of material and spiritual wealth created by generation after generation of laboring people, is unimaginable. Only the laboring people, only those who create history with their labor, wisdom, and lives, are immortal. The immortality of books is also only because they truly record and depict the great achievements of the laboring people, express the thoughts and feelings of the people, and say what the people want to say. The ancients spoke of establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words; first is establishing virtue and merit, then establishing words. Without the virtue and merit of the people, where can there be "words" to establish? If you cannot be the spokesman of the people, how can your "words" be established? In front of the people, we should never have a bit of arrogance. A writer, if he engages in writing only for the sake of earning royalties, for the sake of becoming famous overnight, if he writes one or two small books and is proud of himself, such a writer is too pitiful and too small. Such a writer is not what the people need. As for using one or two books as the capital for anti-party activities, that is even more unacceptable. But careerists, in order to win over the youth as tools for their use, do not hesitate to use the weaknesses of the youth, their lack of experience and competitiveness, to instill arrogant thoughts into them, leading them to the reactionary road. Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, and others corrupted the youth in this way. This should be a lesson for us.

Many comrades correctly pointed out that Feng Xuefeng's literary thoughts and Hu Feng's literary thoughts are consistent in their basic views. Hu Feng is a counter-revolutionary who infiltrated the revolutionary literary ranks. He cleverly concealed his reactionary political history, gained trust, and transformed himself into a "left-wing" writer, carrying out sabotage and disintegration activities from within the revolutionary literature. Feng Xuefeng, however, has always supported Hu Feng and, in literary thought, sings the same tune as Hu Feng. As early as 1936, Feng Xuefeng opposed advocating Marxist worldview to writers, thinking that emphasizing the significance of worldview to creation was an "old mechanical tune." He and Hu Feng, alike, adopted a contemptuous and mocking attitude towards the Party's Marxist literary line. They rejected the principle of serving the laboring people. The so-called "popularization" in their mouths was actually using their bourgeois thoughts to "popularize"; they never mentioned that writers should strive to integrate with the thoughts and feelings of the masses but repeatedly propagated that writers should use what "subjective fighting power," which was actually using the fanatical bourgeois individualist thoughts to "embrace" reality, to "transform" the people. They have always looked down on the national traditions and national forms of literature. Feng Xuefeng scolded the pursuit of "popularization" and "national forms" by writers as the petty bourgeois "vulgarity." When the Party criticized Hu Feng's reactionary literary thoughts in Chongqing in 1945, Feng Xuefeng still stood on Hu Feng's side. He openly defended Hu Feng and opposed the Party's literary policy. After national liberation, the Party and the literary circle entrusted Feng Xuefeng with the heavy responsibility of editing the "Literary Gazette." At that time, although he verbally expressed his support for the line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, he was actually opposed to it. He once tried to make the "Literary Gazette" a platform for propagating his literary thoughts and expanding his personal influence. In the draft of the literary report he prepared for the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1953, under the banner of opposing "subjectivism" and "dogmatism," he put forward a set of revisionist theories, completely denying the achievements of literary work since liberation. His report was not adopted. At that time, the Party Central Committee proposed the general task of the transitional period. The Party required literature to serve the socialist transformation and socialist construction, to overcome and oppose bourgeois thoughts; pointed out that the new forces in literature should be actively fostered; not to be self-satisfied with one's own achievements, nor to be self-deprecating; to believe that our era will definitely produce great works. The Party's views were completely correct. However, Feng Xuefeng and others did not listen to these opinions but continued to adhere to their wrong views. In this independent kingdom of the "Literary Gazette," they went their own way, surrendered to bourgeois idealist thoughts, and suppressed and despised the new forces. The Party and the literary circle had to come out to correct the mistakes of the "Literary Gazette" and reorganize the editorial board. This was the first clear divergence between Feng Xuefeng and the Party on the literary line after national liberation. Feng Xuefeng, although he publicly made a self-criticism at that time, he and his group always regarded the reorganization of the "Literary Gazette" as a blow from the Party and harbored resentment. They always tried to reverse the verdict to make a comeback. During the big outburst, the rightists in the editorial board of the "Literary Gazette," Tang Yin and Tang Zhi, on the one hand, conspired to change the direction of the "Literary Gazette," on the other hand, plotted to have Feng Xuefeng lead the establishment of a so-called collective publication; they declared that they wanted to "conquer the literary world" and open up a new situation through the publication. It can be seen that the rightists' attempt to use publications to make a name for themselves is unyielding. Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, and Jiang Feng also planned to publicly create a situation of great division in the literary circle at the originally scheduled National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in October 1957. The struggle against the rightists made their plots completely fail.

Now it is clear: the degeneration of Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others into rightists is not accidental. This is the inevitable result of the long-term confrontation between their bourgeois individualist worldview and the Party's communist worldview. It is not easy for bourgeois individualists and those with serious individualist thoughts to pass the socialist test. They barely passed the democratic revolutionary test, but when it came to the socialist test, their individualism in their minds could not be reconciled with socialism. In the democratic revolutionary stage, they were not of one heart with the Party and the people. At that time, the targets of opposition were imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and their contradictions with the Party could be temporarily eased or concealed. When our country had already entered the stage of socialist revolution, the bourgeoisie became the target of the revolution. The revolutionary spearhead was aimed at everything that existed in them, including their deeply rooted individualism, liberalism, and other manifestations of bourgeois thought. At this time, they found that the revolution was against what they deeply possessed. If they did not want to reform their ideological stance, they would inevitably clash with the socialist system. The deeper the socialist revolution went, the more solid the socialist system became, the less room their individualism had. Their relationship with the Party and the people would inevitably reach the point of rupture. Wu Zulu said that the larger the organizational force, the smaller the individual force. This sentence is, of course, a slander against the socialist system. Because the socialist society does not eliminate individual force but only makes individual force correctly and fully developed in the combination with collective force. The individuality required by socialism is individuality that is coordinated with the collective, not individuality that is opposed to the collective. Individual talent and wisdom can only be fully developed in a socialist society. However, if he changes his "individual" to "individualism," it is appropriate. To expand socialism, one must reduce individualism. Individualism, in a socialist society, is the source of all evil.

Now, there is a confrontation between the socialist system and the capitalist system in the world; the bourgeoisie still exists domestically. Socialist countries will always adhere to the policy of peaceful coexistence with different social systems, but ideological struggles are inevitable. Although the capitalist system and culture have already declined and rotted, they still have a great attraction for many people. Therefore, thoroughly criticizing bourgeois thought will remain one of the most fundamental and important tasks of ideological work for a considerable period in the future.

**III. The Revisionist Line in Literature**

In the past year or two, both internationally and domestically, there have been a series of major extraordinary events. In 1956, China completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, which was a major change in Chinese history. The productive relations changed, and the productive forces were liberated. The broad masses of workers and peasants were elated. The bourgeoisie, however, did not like this change due to their class nature. Those who were sensible among them tried to adapt to this situation; they saw that only by reforming themselves could they have a bright future in the new society. However, the rightist bourgeoisie and their representatives in the intellectual circle were not willing to do so. They refused to give up the system of exploitation and the ideology of exploitation, despised the new socialist system, and yearned for the old capitalist system, hoping for a capitalist restoration in China. Everything that won the praise of the people, they found fault with. They felt that everything was "not as good as before," like the old woman with nine pounds of rice, always feeling that the world was getting worse and worse. The old economic base they relied on was being eliminated, but they were unwilling to rely on the new economic base. They looked down on the workers and peasants but could not help feeling their strength. This is the fundamental reason for the spiritual turmoil and instability of some bourgeois intellectuals and why they seize the opportunity to attack the people whenever there is a breeze or a rustle of grass. Therefore, to consolidate and develop the socialist system and make the socialist superstructure adapt to the base, it is necessary and inevitable to carry out a socialist revolution in politics and ideology.

Domestic and foreign reactionaries always look for opportunities to attack socialism. Whenever the Communist Party corrects its mistakes, rectifies its style, and conducts open criticism and self-criticism, the reactionaries think that their time to attack has come. Imperialists used the criticism of Stalin by the Soviet Communist Party's 20th Congress to stir up an anti-Soviet, anti-communist tide internationally. The peak of this reactionary wave was the Hungarian incident. How to deal with the Hungarian incident became an important criterion for measuring whether a person is a true communist and a true revolutionary. The vast majority of communists around the world demonstrated their loyalty and firmness to the international communist movement at this critical moment. However, there were also many who could not stand the test. Their thoughts became confused, and their political stance wavered. A few even openly betrayed the cause. This phenomenon was particularly prominent among some progressive intellectuals in the West. American writer Howard Fast was a shameful traitor. In his statement of resignation from the party, he lamented, "The faith I built up in my life has been completely shattered." This is the confession of all traitors throughout history. Obviously, what was shattered was only the thin layer of Marxism he wore, not the true faith in socialism; his soul was deeply permeated with the corrupt ideology of bourgeois liberalism. Such people leaving the ranks of the working class is not a bad thing but a good thing.

The Party Central Committee issued two documents, "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Again," analyzing new problems in the international communist movement, pointing out the two kinds of contradictions in socialist society, and thus clarifying some ideological confusion within and outside the Party. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's correct policy of handling contradictions among the people, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and the subsequent directive to launch a rectification movement throughout the Party have played an immeasurable role in consolidating and developing China's socialist system.

However, the anti-socialist elements in the intellectual circle were encouraged by the international anti-communist tide. Since the spring of 1956, especially after the Hungarian incident, they could no longer hold back their impatience. They interpreted the correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" according to their subjective wishes. Originally, we advocated the free debate of different opinions in academia and the free competition of different styles in art to develop socialist culture. We will long-term and unwaveringly implement this policy. We believe that monopoly, exclusivity, lack of competition, and lack of comparison will not lead science and art to prosperity but will only lead to their decline. We believe that the working class has the power to defeat the bourgeoisie in culture and art through free competition and free debate. The rightist bourgeoisie, however, interpreted "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" as a negation of the Marxist ideological movement. They were very dissatisfied with the ideological remolding movement. They said that the "severe winter" would "thaw," and "spring" was about to come. Their purpose was not to promote academic debate and artistic competition but to use this slogan to stir up a political tide against socialism. Therefore, when our Party began to enter the rectification movement and widely mobilized the masses to express their opinions, they thought that the time had come to reform the Communist Party in their own image. Their first target was the ideological and cultural field. They were eager to seize the ideological position, which they thought was relatively weak and easy to break through. Then, they launched a full-scale attack on the entire socialist cause. In a certain sense, this was not a bad thing for us but a good thing. The rightists exposed their true colors and educated the people from the opposite side.

To take the socialist road or the capitalist road? To be a revolutionary or a reactionary? This is a pressing issue that requires a choice from every Chinese person. In the democratic revolutionary stage, whoever opposed imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism was a revolutionary. Now we have entered the socialist revolutionary stage. To be a revolutionary, one must oppose capitalism and take the socialist road. If you want to take the capitalist road, you are a reactionary. One must choose between the two. There is no middle road.

For Chinese intellectuals, passing the socialist test is much more serious than passing the democratic revolutionary test.

Indeed, in the intellectual and literary circles, many rightists emerged, some of whom were Communist Party members. They played an active role in colluding with the rightists outside the Party to attack the Party. Zhong Dianhua's "The Drums of Cinema" (published in the December 1956 issue of "Literary Gazette") was one of the earliest signals of the rightist attack. This article completely denied the achievements of the film industry since liberation, maliciously attacked the Party's leadership of literary work, and attempted to drag the film industry back to the old capitalist road.

During this period, revisionist thoughts began to rise in the literary circle. Rightist elements and revisionists opposed the line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism. They said that "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" had become "outdated." The principles of socialist realism should be modified or abandoned. Under the slogans of "writing reality" and "intervening in life," they advocated "exposing the dark side of life," believing that only in this way could they find a "new path of realism." For a time, it was indeed "the wind before the rain, the hall filled with wind." The literary wind was blowing to the right. Seeing this phenomenon, some "left" dogmatists panicked and wanted to suppress this perverse trend with simple and brutal methods. Of course, dogmatism and suppression methods cannot overcome revisionism. Dogmatists were afraid of letting people speak out because they did not believe in the power of the working class and the people, nor did they believe in the power of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, their superficial "leftism" actually reflected their "rightism" at the core. The Party resolutely adopted the policy of letting them speak out, because they fought for the right to speak out, went crazy, and wanted to swallow the Communist Party in one breath. They completely lost their reason. They betrayed socialism, betrayed the constitution, and betrayed their own promises. The Party had long since made it clear that we are not afraid of poisonous weeds; we will uproot them and turn them into fertilizer. We are not afraid of ghosts and monsters; we will invite them to be the people's negative teachers. We saw that the poisonous weeds had grown, so let them grow. Because poisonous weeds are an objective existence, the growth of poisonous weeds signifies that the working class's weeding team is about to march out. To cover up the existing poisonous weeds with mud and soil, not allowing them to show their heads, or to suppress them with simple methods as soon as they show their heads, is a stupid and unwise strategy that does not understand the strategy of class struggle and will definitely leave trouble for the future, requiring more labor to uproot them later. The Party believes that the people have the power to identify and overcome poisonous weeds. The Party knows how to deal with class enemies. In this way, the rightist elements in the literary circle, like the rightist elements in other circles, exposed their true colors, bared their fangs and claws, and began to act, forming a confrontation between the two sides. Both sides were happy. The rightists, or reactionaries, were happy because they thought the Communist Party was about to collapse, and capitalism could be restored. The revolutionaries were happy because the ghosts and monsters had come out, and they had the opportunity to eliminate them.

The rightist elements dreamed of a repeat of the Hungarian incident in China. Just as the Hungarian reactionaries used the banners of Kossuth and Petofi as weapons for their counter-revolutionary activities, the Chinese rightists also used the Party's rectification movement to incite a so-called "new May Fourth Movement" against socialism in 1957. At this time, as Li Yuren described, Ding Ling's eyes were shining with joy. Feng Xuefeng's mood had never been so excited. He incited all those who were dissatisfied with the Party and the people's government to "seek revenge if wronged, seek revenge if resentful," using the "stormy" style of "great democracy" to oppose the Party and the state's leadership. Even Chen Yong, who usually did not care much about worldly affairs, said, "The night before the great change has arrived." Zhong Dianhua later admitted in his self-criticism, "My mind experienced a Hungarian incident." This was a genuine confession. Therefore, the collusion between the rightists inside and outside the Party was very natural. The Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian anti-party clique and the rightists of the "Wenhui Daily" communicated secretly, intending to use the "Wenhui Daily" to openly support them to achieve their goal of splitting the literary circle and overthrowing the Party's leadership. Ai Qing played a role in connecting them. Feng Xuefeng became the rightists' backer at the People's Literature Publishing House. The Jiang Feng anti-party clique cooperated closely with the rightists in the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Democratic League, reaching the level of "merging parties and leagues." These people, who claimed to be Communist Party members, did not stand up to defend the interests of the working class when the working class's cause was attacked by the enemy but instead colluded with the enemy to attack the Party. What else could this be called if not betrayal?

The anti-party activities of Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, Feng Xuefeng, and others were not just beginning now. Fifteen years ago, when the revolution was in its most difficult days, the world was facing the slavery of fascism, Hitler's army had occupied a large part of Soviet territory, Yan'an was heavily besieged by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the people and army in the enemy-occupied areas were fighting the most brutal battles with the Japanese invaders, it was at this time that Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, and others in Yan'an colluded with Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, and other bad elements, publishing a series of anti-party articles such as "Wild Lily" and "Reflections on March 8th" in the newspapers and magazines they edited, shooting at the revolution from behind. These articles quickly received the applause of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the same time, Feng Xuefeng supported the Hu Feng clique in the Kuomintang-controlled area, spreading anti-party and anti-Marxist poison. They chose the same time in different regions, responding to each other, and attacking the Party. This incident illustrates a historical law: when the class struggle reaches a sharp stage, and the revolution is at a turning point, there will always be a group of class alien elements and unsteady elements within the Party who cannot stand the test in the storm and expose their true colors.

Fifteen years ago was a turning point in history. The Battle of Stalingrad turned the world situation around. Our Party's first rectification movement laid the foundation for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Fifteen years later, today is another turning point in history. The anti-Soviet, anti-communist tide, which reached its peak with the Hungarian incident, was repelled. Socialist countries and communist parties around the world showed unprecedented unity and strength. The Soviet Union's achievements in science and technology took the lead in the world. Our Party launched the second rectification movement and successfully crushed the rightist attack, making the socialist revolution achieve decisive victory. At the two historical turning points and in the two rectification movements of our Party, Ding Ling and others played the role of anti-party elements twice, which was not accidental.

This time, the rightists in the literary circle set fire to the scene, and the flames were even more fierce than fifteen years ago. However, the revolutionary forces today are far from comparable to fifteen years ago. The arsonists ended up burning themselves. The anti-party faces of Ding Ling and others were finally and thoroughly exposed.

Through the great debate against the rightists, we all, including myself, received a very profound education. The vast majority of writers and artists stood more firmly on the side of socialism. Socialist enthusiasm surged in the literary circle. Rightist elements have no way out unless they thoroughly repent and start anew; there is no other way out. The Party and the people are willing to help them reform, but it mainly depends on their own efforts.

Some people may ask: Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng are old Party members and old left-wing writers. How did they degenerate into rightist elements? What lessons can we learn from their incidents?

Looking back at the road we have traveled. Many of us come from declining feudal landlord or other exploiting classes in terms of upbringing and worldview. The May Fourth New Culture Movement brought us science and democracy and also brought us the new trend of socialism. At that time, we eagerly absorbed all the new knowledge from abroad, and for a while, we could not distinguish the boundaries between anarchism and socialism, individualism and collectivism. Nietzsche, Kropotkin, and Marx were almost equally attractive to us at that time. Later, we recognized that Marxism-Leninism is the only truth and weapon for liberating humanity. We devoted ourselves to the cause of liberating the working class, but the bourgeois individualist thoughts, emotions, and habits in our minds did not fundamentally change. We had an abstract belief in communism, but the actions we took were often driven by individual heroism. We did not integrate with the workers and peasants; we rarely approached them. Democratic revolution was our immediate demand, while socialist revolution was still an ideal. At that time, many of us were more like small-bourgeois revolutionary democrats than proletarian revolutionaries. The influence of individualism on us was difficult to shake off for a long time. Looking back, individualism was once associated with concepts such as "individual liberation" and "personal independence," giving us encouragement in our struggle against feudal oppression and for freedom. The many outstanding works of 19th-century European literature often describe the conflict between the individual and society, indignation at the world, lone struggle, and anarchist rebellion, which left a deep impression on our minds. We enthusiastically welcomed Ibsen and admired his famous saying, "The loneliest person in the world is the strongest." Many of us walked the revolutionary path through individual struggle, carrying the baggage of individualism to join the revolution.

Bourgeois individualism and proletarian collectivism are irreconcilable. We not only need to carry out the bourgeois democratic revolution (this revolution in our country can only be led by the proletariat), but also need to carry out the socialist revolution. The bourgeois individualist thoughts in us have become the biggest obstacle on our path forward.

On the issue of bourgeois individualism, the attitudes of two kinds of people are completely different: one kind of people, through long-term revolutionary struggles, party education, actual struggle tempering, and self-reform, gradually become collectivist warriors. They are determined to throw off the baggage of individualism, reform their thoughts, and are determined to serve the collective interests of the proletariat. Their thoughts and emotions have undergone a revolutionary transformation from one class to another. Throwing off the baggage of individualism is not easy. They often throw it off only after hitting the wall and falling down. After throwing off the baggage, they feel light and happy. They can integrate with the collective and be of one heart with the Party. They find infinite strength in the collective. In this way, they naturally and rightly subordinate personal interests to collective interests. From then on, they can be loyal to the people's cause in any situation. Another kind of people, however, is not like this. They never throw off the baggage of individualism, entangled in personal gains and losses, personal grudges; even after hitting the wall and falling down, they still do not want to throw off the baggage, but carry it even heavier. They do not want to reform themselves according to the spirit of collectivism but always want to reform the Party and our revolutionary cause according to the image of individualism. They put themselves at the center of everything and are incompatible with the collective, not of one heart with the Party. They are self-satisfied with a little achievement, and when they make mistakes and are criticized, they are full of resentment. They cannot stand any serious test. At critical moments, they do not hesitate to betray the working class.

In our Party, the first kind of people and those who are willing to strive to be the first kind of people make up the majority. But the second kind of people is not few. Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng belong to the second kind of people. At the expanded meeting of the Party group of the Writers' Association in 1955, I once said that the most important thing for a Communist Party member is loyalty to the Party. Ding Ling was very resentful of this sentence; she angrily questioned me during the big outburst in 1957 why I had to talk about "loyalty." Ding Ling knew it in her heart. She was originally a thief, afraid to hear the word "loyalty." Ding Ling is a thorough individualist, a person who has always been disloyal to the Party.

Many comrades mentioned "The Diary of Miss Sophie." To understand Ding Ling's character and thoughts, reading her famous work from thirty years ago can be very helpful. The protagonist of the book is a terrible nihilistic individualist. She lies, deceives, and plays with men, taking pleasure in others' pain and using her life as a toy. This character, although appearing in the guise of a rebel against old ethics, is actually an incarnation of the decadent tendencies of a declining class. Of course, a writer can depict various social types; the question is what attitude the author takes towards the characters they depict. Obviously, Ding Ling described this character that should be negated with great sympathy. If this novel reflects her early thoughts, then after joining the Party for a long time, especially after living in the revolutionary base area for a few years, she wrote works like "When I Was in Xiacun" and "In the Hospital," which shows that her extreme individualist thoughts not only did not improve but developed to the point of sharp conflict with the working class and the laboring masses. The novel "When I Was in Xiacun" glorifies a woman who was taken away by the Japanese invaders to be a camp prostitute as a goddess. It is noteworthy that Feng Xuefeng, in the "Afterword to Ding Ling's Collected Works," said that the "soul" described by the author was so "rich and brilliant and great." This shows how similar their tastes are. Ding Ling's "In the Hospital," written in 1941, more concentratedly expresses her hostility towards the working class and the laboring people. This novel is a microcosm of Ding Ling's extreme individualist reactionary worldview. The novel describes a young female Communist Party member, Lu Ping, who has serious anti-party sentiments, as a heroine of the new society, just because the organization did not satisfy her unrealistic fantasies when allocating work, the author could not help but sympathize with her protagonist, cursing the needs of the Party and the revolution as an "iron hoop" around the neck. In the case of conflict between personal interests and collective interests, Lu Ping looks at everything in Yan'an with enmity and carries out a series of anti-party activities in the hospital. The novel portrays the laboring masses in the revolutionary base area as stupid and numb people, depicts Yan'an as a cruel, merciless, and terrifying place, and portrays the revolutionary cadres in Yan'an from top to bottom as hopeless. Therefore, the author supports her female protagonist in "fighting" with everyone. Ding Ling wrote, "She sought revenge, looking for gaps to attack everywhere, she criticized everything. She thought hard every day about how to defeat others, she always believed that the truth was on her side." Ding Ling's novel precisely propagates her anti-party, anti-people "truth," the "truth" of extreme bourgeois individualism. From Sophie onwards, in the life experiences and personalities of many of Ding Ling's female protagonists, there are shadows of the author herself. She admires Sophie-like women very much. Her admiration for the notorious rightist Lin Xiling is not accidental. She praises this type of woman as the most lovable and strong-willed character. It can be said that for many years, the spirit of Miss Sophie has always been attached to Ding Ling, only later she wore the clothes of a communist, making her appearance not so easy to recognize, and her harm was even greater.

Stubborn individualists, in revolutionary struggles, become very fragile when facing serious tests. Ding Ling's surrender to the Kuomintang in Nanjing in 1933, turning from a prisoner of the secret police to their guest, betraying the Communist Party and the working class, is a manifestation of her fragility. Later, Ding Ling went to Yan'an, hiding this part of her history, and deceiving the Party's trust. In 1942, she published articles like "Reflections on March 8th," colluding with Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, and others to oppose the Party, showing great stubbornness. This can be said to be a continuation and development of her betrayal of the Party. The Party fought resolutely against her. However, when she expressed her willingness to correct her mistakes, the Party still tried to save her and encouraged her to go to the masses to reform herself. "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" was written under the Party's help.

The liberation of the whole country and a book "On the Sanggan River" brought Ding Ling fame and status. In the first one or two years after liberation, she did some work. But her individualism also developed. She forgot the Party's criticism and education, becoming arrogant and unruly. She used the positions entrusted by the Party and the people to cultivate her own clique, attempting to realize her ambition to dominate the literary world. She, Chen Qingxian, and Feng Xuefeng turned the "Literary Gazette" they edited at that time into an independent kingdom. In 1954, the Party and the literary circle checked the mistakes in the work of the "Literary Gazette," which greatly angered them. Their "kingdom" was untouchable. From then on, they harbored resentment. Their anti-party clique's activities became more and more blatant. The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng also regarded them as a force that could be won over for cooperation. In 1955, the Party group of the Writers' Association exposed Ding Ling and Chen Qingxian's anti-party activities and fought against them uncompromisingly. At that time, they made self-criticisms that they later called "insincere." As Chen Qingxian confessed, they were full of "mad revenge." When the rightists attacked, their anti-party activities reached their peak.

This is Ding Ling's performance in the three periods of Nanjing, Yan'an, and Beijing, at every important historical juncture.

Now let's look at Feng Xuefeng's political and ideological development from history. Feng Xuefeng also did some work for the revolution, but his deep individualism, anarchism, and proletarian collectivism, and the Party's organizational discipline often conflicted. Feng Xuefeng summarized his relationship with the Party in his self-criticism with two sentences: "When successful, the individual is above the Party; when unsuccessful, the individual is outside the Party." In 1936, he came from the revolutionary base area of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia to Shanghai, appearing in the guise of an envoy, on the one hand, he regarded Hu Feng as a comrade, on the other hand, he gave a very bad sectarian blow to the underground Party organization in Shanghai at that time, causing the split of the revolutionary literary cause. This was a big thing Feng Xuefeng did in his so-called "successful" period. In 1937, because the Party did not satisfy his personal ambition for status, he voluntarily left the Party and became a deserter of the revolution. The outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, the national enthusiasm was high, but he was alone, depressed. From then on, his so-called "unsuccessful" life began.

In 1943, Feng Xuefeng came out of the Urumqi concentration camp, but he did not become stronger. Instead, his mood was darker and more depressed. The collection of miscellaneous essays he wrote that year, titled "Village Wind and City Wind," was full of empty, lonely, pessimistic, and desperate emotions. He saw the stupidity and numbness of the people, the "slavishness and meanness of survival." He lost confidence in the entire nation. At that time, the Japanese invaders had occupied a large part of China and were carrying out slave education on Chinese soil. Feng Xuefeng advocated the "hegemonic power" of the nation at this time, advocating the "nationalization" of national culture, and propagating that national culture "can also be raped to produce offspring" (see "Hegemonic Power"). In this book, he also shamelessly propagated individualist and idealist thoughts, propagated the philosophy of feudal class "dying for one's lord" and personal ambition. He said that "dying for one's lord" is limited to "one's lord," which is "not only showing loyalty to the power one depends on but also respecting one's independent will" (see "On the Code of Chivalry and a Discussion of Zhou Zuoren"). He said, "This is a victory in our history." He also said that "the ambition of heroes is also what the ambitious scholars want to embrace, those righteousness; at the same time, the ambition of heroes, when it touches the utility of life, is indeed giving virtue a new life" (see "On the Code of Chivalry and a Discussion of Zhou Zuoren"). What kind of words are these? It is no wonder that after national liberation, Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Chen Qingxian, and others greatly developed their personal ambitions and propagated "dying for one's lord" to the youth, originally they had their reactionary philosophical basis.

In the collection of essays "Advance or Retreat" written in 1944 and 1945, Feng Xuefeng propagated the subjective fighting spirit of individualism, sang the praises of the craziness of the petty bourgeoisie, and in many places, his tone was the same as Hu Feng's. We know that Hu Feng advocated craziness and spasms. Feng Xuefeng also said that today's era and society "require madmen above madmen, require strongmen above strongmen, require the melee of madmen above madmen, require the rebellion of the strongest" (see "Going Mad"). When the Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in 1945, due to the arson of American conspirators and Nazi bandits, some places in Berlin became a sea of fire, Feng Xuefeng did not condemn the enemy's atrocities but praised the "epic-like" inferno, the "epic-like" terror. He described the victory of the Soviet army in liberating Hitler's Germany as a "really terrifying whip"; he described the liberated Berlin as the "city of human terror." This revealed his fear of the revolution and his crazy psychology. Where was there a bit of the taste of a communist? In 1944, Feng Xuefeng published an article titled "On Friendship." At that time, he had just come out of the enemy's concentration camp, but in this article, he did not show any hatred towards class enemies but emphasized the propaganda of "broad human friendship," saying that this is the only "fundamental requirement" of humans. What was even stranger was that he especially emphasized friendship and loyalty to friends, saying that even if a friend who wanted to betray the Party and join the enemy, "if you do not first advise and stop the friend or comrade, but only report his intention as if it were information to society or the organization, this may be said to be loyal to society or the organization, but to the friend or comrade, it is malicious and almost terrifying." Obviously, in his mind, there was only the interest of personal friendship, not the interest of the Party and the people. In fact, from Feng Xuefeng's words and deeds before and after, we only saw his loyalty to the bourgeoisie, but we did not see his loyalty to the proletariat; we only saw his friendship and loyalty to himself, his good friend Hu Feng, Ding Ling, and others, but we did not see his loyalty to the Party and the people. I quoted more of Feng Xuefeng's articles written in the period from 1943 to 1945 to let everyone see what the "communist" was really thinking and feeling in the months when dark clouds covered the whole world.

In 1949, when the country was liberated, Feng Xuefeng did not feel excited but felt depressed, as he himself said, he had a feeling like "being kicked aside like a small stone." It is no wonder that he looked at the victory of the revolution and everything new with a dark eye. Darkness is a psychological characteristic of individualists like Feng Xuefeng. When our country entered the stage of socialist revolution, Feng Xuefeng felt more and more resistance and disgust towards the socialist system and socialist culture. His mood became more and more depressed and more and more irritable. And when the rightists attacked, his long-suppressed anti-party emotions erupted. His combination with Ding Ling and others' anti-party activities was completely exposed.

Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng, although they have been Party members for more than twenty or thirty years, from their worldview and long-term behavior, they are actually bourgeois literary aristocrats within the Party, bourgeois individualist careerists within the Party. They are very fragile in front of the enemy but often make waves within the revolution. They refuse to reform their thoughts according to the requirements of the Party and the revolution but want to reform the Party and our society according to their bourgeois individualist image, and first of all, they want to reform the people's literary cause.

Many comrades correctly criticized Ding Ling's "one-bookism." This is very meaningful. This is a struggle between two worldviews, two fundamentally different attitudes towards the literary cause: whether to regard the literary cause as a part of the people's cause or to regard it as a means for personal gain and fame? Whether to use the former attitude, that is, communist thought, to cultivate young writers or to use the latter attitude, that is, bourgeois individualist thought, to cultivate young writers?

We hope that every writer will write good books, and not just one. Without works, what is the literary cause? But the "one-bookism" harms our literary cause, and under this kind of thought, it is impossible to produce good works. "One-bookism" regards writing books as a tool to satisfy personal desires for fame and wealth, thinking that writing one book can reach out to the people to ask for things and stand above the people. "With one book, no one can knock you down." This is their slogan. In the literary circle, such people are not few: writing one book, painting one picture, making one film, gaining a little fame, and then looking down on everything. The greater the personal fame, the smaller the position of the Party and the people in their hearts. Their thoughts and feelings are farther and farther away from the people. They feel that the people owe them a favor. They forget that honor is given to them by the people. Greed for fame and wealth and self-satisfaction are important reasons for the moral and political decline of many literary workers.

"One-bookism" regards writing books as more noble than anything else, as if works are created only by individual genius. They do not understand that any genius creation, without the current struggle of the people, without the accumulation of material and spiritual wealth created by generation after generation of laboring people, is unimaginable. Only the laboring people, only those who create history with their labor, wisdom, and lives, are immortal. The immortality of books is also only because they truly record and depict the great achievements of the laboring people, express the thoughts and feelings of the people, and say what the people want to say. The ancients spoke of establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words; first is establishing virtue and merit, then establishing words. Without the virtue and merit of the people, where can there be "words" to establish? If you cannot be the spokesman of the people, how can your "words" be established? In front of the people, we should never have a bit of arrogance. A writer, if he engages in writing only for the sake of earning royalties, for the sake of becoming famous overnight, if he writes one or two small books and is proud of himself, such a writer is too pitiful and too small. Such a writer is not what the people need. As for using one or two books as the capital for anti-party activities, that is even more unacceptable. But careerists, in order to win over the youth as tools for their use, do not hesitate to use the weaknesses of the youth, their lack of experience and competitiveness, to instill arrogant thoughts into them, leading them to the reactionary road. Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, and others corrupted the youth in this way. This should be a lesson for us.

Many comrades correctly pointed out that Feng Xuefeng's literary thoughts and Hu Feng's literary thoughts are consistent in their basic views. Hu Feng is a counter-revolutionary who infiltrated the revolutionary literary ranks. He cleverly concealed his reactionary political history, gained trust, and transformed himself into a "left-wing" writer, carrying out sabotage and disintegration activities from within the revolutionary literature. Feng Xuefeng, however, has always supported Hu Feng and, in literary thought, sings the same tune as Hu Feng. As early as 1936, Feng Xuefeng opposed advocating Marxist worldview to writers, thinking that emphasizing the significance of worldview to creation was an "old mechanical tune." He and Hu Feng, alike, adopted a contemptuous and mocking attitude towards the Party's Marxist literary line. They rejected the principle of serving the laboring people. The so-called "popularization" in their mouths was actually using their bourgeois thoughts to "popularize"; they never mentioned that writers should strive to integrate with the thoughts and feelings of the masses but repeatedly propagated that writers should use what "subjective fighting power," which was actually using the fanatical bourgeois individualist thoughts to "embrace" reality, to "transform" the people. They have always looked down on the national traditions and national forms of literature. Feng Xuefeng scolded the pursuit of "popularization" and "national forms" by writers as the petty bourgeois "vulgarity." When the Party criticized Hu Feng's reactionary literary thoughts in Chongqing in 1945, Feng Xuefeng still stood on Hu Feng's side. He openly defended Hu Feng and opposed the Party's literary policy. After national liberation, the Party and the literary circle entrusted Feng Xuefeng with the heavy responsibility of editing the "Literary Gazette." At that time, although he verbally expressed his support for the line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, he was actually opposed to it. He once tried to make the "Literary Gazette" a platform for propagating his literary thoughts and expanding his personal influence. In the draft of the literary report he prepared for the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1953, under the banner of opposing "subjectivism" and "dogmatism," he put forward a set of revisionist theories, completely denying the achievements of literary work since liberation. His report was not adopted. At that time, the Party Central Committee proposed the general task of the transitional period. The Party required literature to serve the socialist transformation and socialist construction, to overcome and oppose bourgeois thoughts; pointed out that the new forces in literature should be actively fostered; not to be self-satisfied with one's own achievements, nor to be self-deprecating; to believe that our era will definitely produce great works. The Party's views were completely correct. However, Feng Xuefeng and others did not listen to these opinions but continued to adhere to their wrong views. In this independent kingdom of the "Literary Gazette," they went their own way, surrendered to bourgeois idealist thoughts, and suppressed and despised the new forces. The Party and the literary circle had to come out to correct the mistakes of the "Literary Gazette" and reorganize the editorial board. This was the first clear divergence between Feng Xuefeng and the Party on the literary line after national liberation. Feng Xuefeng, although he publicly made a self-criticism at that time, he and his group always regarded the reorganization of the "Literary Gazette" as a blow from the Party and harbored resentment. They always tried to reverse the verdict to make a comeback. During the big outburst, the rightists in the editorial board of the "Literary Gazette," Tang Yin and Tang Zhi, on the one hand, conspired to change the direction of the "Literary Gazette," on the other hand, plotted to have Feng Xuefeng lead the establishment of a so-called collective publication; they declared that they wanted to "conquer the literary world" and open up a new situation through the publication. It can be seen that the rightists' attempt to use publications to make a name for themselves is unyielding. Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian, and Jiang Feng also planned to publicly create a situation of great division in the literary circle at the originally scheduled National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in October 1957. The struggle against the rightists made their plots completely fail.

Now it is clear: the degeneration of Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, and others into rightists is not accidental. This is the inevitable result of the long-term confrontation between their bourgeois individualist worldview and the Party's communist worldview. It is not easy for bourgeois individualists and those with serious individualist thoughts to pass the socialist test. They barely passed the democratic revolutionary test, but when it came to the socialist test, their individualism in their minds could not be reconciled with socialism. In the democratic revolutionary stage, they were not of one heart with the Party and the people. At that time, the targets of opposition were imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and their contradictions with the Party could be temporarily eased or concealed. When our country had already entered the stage of socialist revolution, the bourgeoisie became the target of the revolution. The revolutionary spearhead was aimed at everything that existed in them, including their deeply rooted individualism, liberalism, and other manifestations of bourgeois thought. At this time, they found that the revolution was against what they deeply possessed. If they did not want to reform their ideological stance, they would inevitably clash with the socialist system. The deeper the socialist revolution went, the more solid the socialist system became, the less room their individualism had. Their relationship with the Party and the people would inevitably reach the point of rupture. Wu Zulu said that the larger the organizational force, the smaller the individual force. This sentence is, of course, a slander against the socialist system. Because the socialist society does not eliminate individual force but only makes individual force correctly and fully developed in the combination with collective force. The individuality required by socialism is individuality that is coordinated with the collective, not individuality that is opposed to the collective. Individual talent and wisdom can only be fully developed in a socialist society. However, if he changes his "individual" to "individualism," it is appropriate. To expand socialism, one must reduce individualism. Individualism, in a socialist society, is the source of all evil.

Now, there is a confrontation between the socialist system and the capitalist system in the world; the bourgeoisie still exists domestically. Socialist countries will always adhere to the policy of peaceful coexistence with different social systems, but ideological struggles are inevitable. Although the capitalist system and culture have already declined and rotted, they still have a great attraction for many people. Therefore, thoroughly criticizing bourgeois thought will remain one of the most fundamental and important tasks of ideological work for a considerable period in the future.

Title: The Two Lines in Literary Thought and the Struggle Between Them
Author:

Page: 1

Due to differences in class stance and worldview, there are fundamental disagreements between us and the right-wing elements of the bourgeoisie in literary thought. There are two lines. One is: literature serves the interests of workers, peasants, and all laboring people, truly reflects the lives and struggles of the masses, and is understood and loved by the masses, elevating the masses' thoughts and emotions, and inspiring the masses to build a new life. This literature promotes the development and progress of society. This is the socialist literary line we advocate, which is also the Marxist literary line. The other line is: literature does not serve the interests and needs of the broad masses but only serves a few, only expresses oneself, satisfies personal desires for fame and profit, and caters to the tastes of a few, not inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses but dampening the fighting will of the masses. This literature is not a promoter but a retarder of social development. This is the literary line advocated by the right-wing elements, which is also the anti-Marxist or revisionist literary line.

The proletarian literary viewpoint and the reactionary literary viewpoint of the bourgeoisie have always been in conflict; socialist literature has grown up in this struggle. Socialist literature is the true literature of the laboring people. It has attracted all those inspired by the great goal of socialism and willing to serve the laboring people to join its ranks, while also continuously facing attacks, slander, and ridicule from the literary aristocrats of the bourgeoisie. Over the past twenty-plus years, our proletarian literary movement has, on the one hand, resisted the bloody persecution of the reactionary rulers and, on the other hand, engaged in sharp struggles with various reactionary literary agents. We have smashed feudal comprador literature and fascist literature. We have refuted the nonsense of the New Moon School and the Third Kind of People and other bourgeois literary factions. At that time, as Lu Xun said, the proletarian literary movement became the only literary movement in China. No reactionary literary faction or literary group could compete with it. After national liberation, we criticized the reactionary tendencies of "The Biography of Wu Xun," criticized the bourgeois viewpoints in the research on "Dream of the Red Chamber," thoroughly exposed and criticized the counterrevolutionary thoughts of the Hu Feng clique and their literary ideas, and comprehensively criticized the thoughts of Hu Shi.

The bourgeoisie will not give up or stop attacking socialist literature. In this round of international and domestic anti-communist tide, socialist literature has again faced a new attack. Revisionists have come out to show off their skills. They generally do not openly oppose socialist literature. Their methods of opposition are more cunning. They exaggerate the shortcomings in our literary work one-sidedly, using this to smear socialist literature with dirt. Our right-wing elements and revisionists have picked up the droppings of foreign reactionary writers to defame the socialist literature of the Soviet Union and our country. Feng Xuefeng said that the spirit of struggle for socialism in Soviet literature is not as good as the humanitarian spirit in old Russian literature (in a speech at the editorial meeting). Liu Shaotang also parroted that Soviet literature in the past twenty years is not as good as in the previous twenty years, and that our country's literature has degenerated in the fifteen years since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art (in a speech at the Beijing Municipal Propaganda Conference). Wu Zuolang believes that literary work since liberation has been the worst. Feng Xuefeng said that our literary works have "very low authenticity" (in a draft report to the Second Congress of Literature and Art). Wu Zuolang sees our current literature and society as a complete sham. He said that in our literature, there are no "sincere words," no "words from the heart" ("Talking About the Backstage"). Why can't writers say "words from the heart"? It is said that it is because there is no "creative freedom" in our society. Therefore, Qin Zhaoyang said that writers are "always looking left and right, anxious," "dare not write" about "the most stirring, most serious, and most acute themes," but can only write "ordinary things" (see "Daily Conversations," pen name Jian Yu).

Denying or belittling the achievements of socialist literature, saying that socialist literature is not authentic, and saying that there is no "creative freedom" in our society, these are the main arguments of the right-wing elements and revisionists against socialist literature. It is clear that their targets of attack are not just literature itself, but the entire socialist system.

How should we evaluate the achievements of socialist literature?

Socialist literature is a new type of literature that has never existed in history. No literature from any previous era can compare to it. In the past, very few literary works took the labor and struggles of workers and peasants as their themes. The true laborers, those who create the material and spiritual wealth of society, have not been given their due place in past works. Landlords, nobles, merchants, the bourgeoisie, and their political and ideological representatives have occupied the vast majority of past works. This is unfair. Socialist literature fundamentally changes this unreasonable phenomenon. Serving the laboring people is the fundamental policy of socialist literature. It affirms and praises the great struggles of the working class with unlimited enthusiasm. It depicts the new relationships, new morals, and customs established on the basis of socialism, and the new characters and personalities who are gradually shedding the influences of the old society, as well as their struggles against old things and old ideas. No literature has ever been as powerful in affirming life, affirming reality, believing in humanity, believing in the future, and believing in the boundless creativity of the people. No literature has ever been as thorough in thought and emotion, as optimistic in spirit, as magnificent in scope, and as far-reaching in ideals. Our literature, as a positive weapon of spiritual education, has received the broadest support and love from the people. Now, a good book can sell tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of copies, and a good film can have tens of millions of viewers. This is something that the literary and artistic undertakings of the past could never compare to. The people have become the active masters of literature and art; they care about literature and art and regard literary and artistic undertakings as an important part of their great creative undertakings. Writers are no longer figures standing above or outside the people but are members of the people's masses. They regard maintaining close ties with the masses and striving to write for the people as their sacred duty. Is this not the most advanced and noble literature in history?

The great achievements of socialist literature are something that no one can erase. Some Western bourgeois writers and certain revisionists in people's democratic countries, using the criticism of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, have been loudly proclaiming that Soviet literature has "stagnated," that socialist realism shows that Soviet literature has "degenerated," and that socialist realism is just a slogan "invented" by a few people, and that such literature does not exist in reality. They not only oppose the socialist tendencies in literature but also fundamentally deny realism, believing that realism is an "outdated" method and are enamored with fashionable modernism and other decadent tendencies. Their clamor does not harm the glory of Soviet literature but rather exposes their reactionary bourgeois views and prejudices. Soviet literature, with its advanced worldview and revolutionary spirit, has educated and inspired readers all over the world; it has driven batch after batch of people to join the revolution and educated batch after batch of people to become builders of the new life. The development of literature among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is something that the old era could not have dreamed of. Some nationalities that did not even have their own scripts now have their own literature and their own writers. What kind of literature can make such great contributions to humanity? What kind of literature can have such a broad mass base? Who can deny the value of such literature? It is undeniable that Soviet literature is the great pioneer of world proletarian literature, and socialist realism is a new stage in the development of human art.

Our country's literature, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has always regarded socialist realism as the most correct principle of creation and regarded Soviet works as its models. We learn from the experience of the Soviet Union, of course, not in a dogmatic and mechanical way, but independently and analytically. Socialist literature can only be born and developed on its own national soil; it must critically inherit national traditions and have national characteristics. We have always been striving in this direction.

Because our literature is connected with the most advanced class, the most advanced thought, and the most advanced social system, it has achieved tremendous development in a short period of time that is unparalleled by any previous era. Right-wing elements say that there are fewer works now, fewer plays, and everything is worse than before. Yes, the literature that landlords, nobles, and bourgeois lords need not only has decreased but will also be completely eliminated. As for the literature that the laboring people need, it is not decreasing but has never been as abundant as it is today. This is a fact that everyone can see except for the right-wing elements who close their eyes and talk nonsense. Our new literature is gradually penetrating into factories, villages, and the army. Now, writers of worker and peasant origin and actual working cadres are emerging in increasing numbers. Excellent writers are also emerging from among the various brother nationalities. The amateur literary creation of the working people is becoming more and more abundant. Village drama troupes have developed to tens of thousands, and the number of amateur-written plays is in the tens of thousands. Right-wing elements, of course, look down on the creation of the masses, but we see from this unprecedented scale of popularization the future of our country's literary and artistic undertakings. We have always attached importance to the popularization of literature and art and the large-scale development of amateur creation by the laboring masses. The mass line of literature and art ensures that our literature and art can achieve universal prosperity and flourishing. However, we are never satisfied with the achievements of literary and artistic undertakings, because it is still far from what the people hope for and expect from it. It is undeniable that we still have too few good works today, and there are still very few writers among today's writers who can catch up with and surpass some of our great predecessors. Many writers still lack the ability to make a high-level artistic generalization of society and the times. This is not surprising. The maturity of the literature of an era requires a relatively long process.

Socialist literature is still a relatively young literature. Soviet literature, from Gorky's "Mother" in 1907, is only about fifty years old. Our new literature movement from the May Fourth Movement to now is not yet forty years old; strictly speaking, our literature clearly and consciously began to serve the workers and peasants and socialism after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, which is only about fifteen years old. This is much shorter compared to the Chinese feudal era literature with a history of more than two thousand years and the European bourgeois era literature with a history of four to five hundred years. How can we use the standards to measure things produced in several hundred or several thousand years to measure things produced in several dozen years? However, when our writers thoroughly understand the era we are in, truly become one with the laboring masses, and fully master the excellent cultural heritage, when literature has a solid new mass base, socialist literature will certainly not only quickly catch up with and surpass the literature of any previous era in thought but also in the crystallization of art. We have always been full of confidence about this; we are creating the necessary conditions for this goal every day.

In our country, it was only in 1957 that a thorough socialist revolution was carried out on the ideological and political fronts nationwide, dealing a fatal blow to reactionary bourgeois ideology, liberating the productive forces of the literary and artistic circles and their reserve army, removing the shackles and chains of the old society, and eliminating the threat of reactionary air, opening up a broad path for the development of proletarian literature and art. Before this, this historical task was not completed. The work of opening up this path will continue in the future, and the elimination of the old base is not something that can be completed in a year. However, the basic path has been opened up, and tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of columns of proletarian literary and artistic warriors can gallop on this path. Literature and art also need to build an army and train soldiers. A completely new-type proletarian literary and artistic army is being formed, and its formation can only be simultaneous with the formation of the proletarian intellectual army, and its production results can only be roughly simultaneous. This logic can only be considered incorrect by those who do not understand historical materialism.

Socialist literature and art must inherit all the excellent traditions of past literature and art. Our writers must learn from their predecessors. However, since our literature and art are called socialist literature and art, they can only have the communist worldview as their ideological foundation. Therefore, they must, as pointed out in the "Communist Manifesto," "carry out the most thorough break with all the inherited ideas." Otherwise, they will be like the so-called "true socialists" poets criticized in the "Manifesto," writing works that are called "socialist" but are actually bourgeois. We value tradition, but we are not like Zhong Dianxian, who wants to return to the past. We must inherit and develop tradition on a new ideological foundation. Our literature and art should educate people with communist thought, not instill feudalist or capitalist thought into people. Feng Xuefeng advised the editors of "Poetry" to make this magazine into a nineteenth-century or twenty-first-century one, not a twentieth-century one. What does this mean? It means that we should detach our poets from today's reality and the current struggles of the people; it means that we should only inherit the legacy of nineteenth-century Western bourgeois literature and propagate bourgeois individualist thought, not propagate the socialist thought of the working class. Revisionists are particularly disgusted with literature and art expressing socialist thought. They try to deny the distinction between socialist realist literature and art and the principles of realism literature of all previous eras. Qin Zhaoyang is like this. He said, "It is difficult to draw an absolutely different line between the content characteristics of realist literature in the new and old eras." ("Realism - A Broad Road") There is no "absolute" line in any matter in the world, but blurring the boundaries is blurring the understanding of things, denying the essential differences of things. Qin Zhaoyang's words are nothing but denying the class nature of literature and art, denying the innovative significance of socialist literature and art. In essence, it is to replace socialist literature and art with bourgeois literature and art.

How should we view the issue of authenticity in literature?

Undoubtedly, literature must be authentic. Literature and art without authenticity are valueless and not needed by the people. The question is: what is authenticity? From what stance and with what purpose do writers and artists describe authenticity?

First of all, we should say that socialist literature and art are the most authentic literature and art. Because the working class is the most advanced class, it has never been afraid to reveal the true state of life. Only the exploiting class, in order to deceive the eyes of the laboring people, needs to cover up the true face of reality. It is precisely socialist literature and art that truly reflect the heroic process of the people's masses transforming the world through labor and struggle, and describe the complex phenomena of class struggle and new-old struggle that drive society forward. This literature and art have touched the hearts of millions of people in the new era. What literature and art in the world are more authentic than this?

Everyone knows that literature and art are reflections of life, and there are all kinds of contradictions in real life. Marxism tells us: the main contradictions of humanity are the contradictions between humans and nature and the contradictions between humans and humans, which are embodied in the struggle for production and class struggle, and after the elimination of classes, they are embodied in new-old struggles. Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out that in the contradictions between humans and humans, we must strictly distinguish between two kinds of contradictions with different natures: one is the contradiction between the people and their enemies, and the other is the contradictions within the people. Our literature and art have depicted tragic and heart-stirring scenes of how the people bravely and heroically struggle against their oppressors and exploiters. But to depict how the people, after becoming masters of their own destiny, correctly handle their own contradictions, how to shed the long-term influences of the old society left on them, how to correctly solve the relationship between the individual and the collective, how to let the advanced overcome the backward, and bring the backward along to advance together, this has presented our writers and artists with unprecedented new creative tasks and a series of new problems that need to be solved by socialist realist literature and art. Right-wing elements and revisionists are precisely entangled with us on this issue. Dogmatists either do not see or do not want to admit the contradictions within the people, and thus inevitably fall into the theory of no conflict in literature and art, which is of course wrong. However, right-wing elements and revisionists deliberately blur or cover up the contradictions between the people and their enemies, and regard the contradictions within the people, especially the contradictions between the led and the leaders, as the contradictions between the oppressed people of the old era and the reactionary rulers. They exaggerate the contradictions within the people, turning what is originally a matter of right and wrong between the people into a matter of enemy and friend, which is even more wrong and much more dangerous. They believe that the main task of literature and art is to expose the shortcomings of our society and reveal the dark side of life. In their eyes, it seems that only works that expose the dark side are "authentic," while works that "sing the praises of the bright side" are all "whitewashing reality" and "inauthentic." Their so-called authenticity is that kind of negative, backward, stagnant, and dying thing. They cannot or do not want to see all the vibrant, powerful, boiling, and advancing things as the mainstream of socialist reality, cannot or do not want to observe socialist authenticity with a revolutionary and developmental perspective, and deny that revolutionary romanticism is an indispensable aspect of socialist realism. They advocate that writers naturalistically go to every corner of life to collect shortcomings and find darkness, then enlarge them and display them one by one, making the people lose heart and the enemy clap their hands, causing people to lose hope and doubt the revolution and the socialist system. This is the purpose of their advocacy of so-called "writing authenticity," their advocacy of what they call "boldly intervening in life."

The theory of advocating that writers and artists expose the "darkness" of the people is nothing new. As early as fifteen years ago, Wang Shuo in Yan'an was the first to advocate this theory, and Xiao Jun, Luo Bin, and others followed suit, using the excuse of "even the sun has spots" and borrowing the so-called "Lu Xun style," inciting writers to use the "daggers" and "spears" of Lu Xun's essays to attack the working class and the laboring people. Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8" and "In the Hospital" are practical examples of this advocacy. "Talk at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" gave a severe criticism of this reactionary thought. Unfortunately, in the past one or two years, under the impact of international revisionist trends, the call to write about darkness has become rampant in our country, almost becoming a fashion. Liu Binyan became famous in such an atmosphere. They are precisely the inheritors of the Wang Shuo tradition. Obviously, they are not really trying to solve the problem of how to truly reflect the contradictions within the people and correctly criticize the backward phenomena in life in their works, but are using this to exaggerate the contradictions within the people, confuse right and wrong, and confuse friend and foe, trying to lead literature and art onto an anti-people path.

Do shortcomings and dark sides exist in our society? Of course, they exist. Shortcomings and dark sides not only exist now but will always exist in the future; otherwise, history would not continue to progress. History always progresses in the process of contradictions and struggles, always progresses in the process of overcoming shortcomings and dark sides. Old shortcomings are overcome, and new shortcomings will emerge. In our current period, the system of exploitation has been basically eliminated, but the influences of old ideas and habits are still stubbornly lingering; the economic and cultural lives of the people have not yet been raised to a higher level; the people, in order to build their new lives, still have to endure and overcome various unimaginable difficulties; bureaucracy and various phenomena of detachment from the masses and violation of the interests of the masses still occur frequently. We certainly do not need to cover up these negative and dark sides of life. However, we must see that it is the new, positive, and advanced things in life that are the main and decisive things in our society. Six hundred million Chinese people have organized themselves, have socialist awareness, and have a high sense of discipline. This is the force that can move mountains and rivers and change the universe. True patriots and lovers of the people, who can be unmoved and inspired by this? Only those writers and artists who are spiritually connected to the declining class do not want to see this great change in our lives, do not want to admit the strong vitality of new things, and face the vigorously developing new reality, they only see darkness and shortcomings. Those with a dark psychology see everything as dark. For them, darkness is the only authenticity. They are afraid to see the light, the overwhelming light of socialism, which makes them very uncomfortable. This is a complete reflection of their class instincts. They always face the past, yearn for the past, and regard the lives and psychological portraits of people in the past era of landlord and bourgeois rule as an unchanging authenticity. They do not see or do not want to see the fundamental changes in the characters and relationships of new-era people. Literature should deeply excavate the soul of people, not simplify human psychology. However, the times have changed, and the characters and relationships have also changed. How can literature still describe things in the old way? People with collectivist thoughts and high discipline have emerged in life, and they are the heroes of the new era. Right-wing elements and revisionists do not believe that in this new era, people's thoughts can have no individualism, heroes can face danger without fear, and their hearts can have no slightest wavering. They do not believe in all this. "If one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth," "everywhere is as black as crows," this is their philosophy. If works write the authenticity of new life and new characters, they think it is not authentic, "idealized." New things are clearly in a large existence in life, but they still do not see them, still insist on looking for old things; and when new things are still in the budding stage, they are even less worthy of their glance. We criticize the formulaic and conceptual nature of works, mainly because these works have not been able to make a powerful and profound reflection of the reality of the heroes of our era. They have simplified life. Right-wing elements and revisionists, however, are the opposite. They are not satisfied with these works reflecting the new life of the workers and peasants to a certain extent, and they do not like this life. They say that life is "formulaic and conceptual," and the masses are "dogmatic," which shows that they oppose not the formulaic and conceptual tendencies of works, but the new life itself, the socialist system itself. Liu Shaotang opposes socialist realism, believing that writers should not observe and describe reality from a "dynamic" perspective but from a "static" perspective, which precisely reflects his fear of socialist changes and his reactionary bourgeois perspective.

Our disagreements with right-wing elements and revisionists are not only in that they deliberately and inappropriately exaggerate the shortcomings and dark sides of our lives, but more importantly, they, from the standpoint of bourgeois individualism, often regard the positive and active things in life as bad phenomena, while regarding the negative and passive things as good things. In their eyes, agricultural cooperation is a bad thing and should be opposed, while the capitalist spontaneous forces of rich middle peasants are good and worthy of sympathy; ideological reform is not good, insisting on bourgeois ideology is good; individual submission to the collective is not good, developing individualism is good; obeying discipline is not good, liberalism is good. In their eyes, those who work diligently and loyally for the Party are "retrogressive" or "mediocre" people, while those who are arrogant and disregard the organization are people with "vigor" and "talent." People's stances are different, and their senses of smell and vision are also different. Ding Ling's "In the Hospital" and Liu Binyan's "Internal News of This Newspaper" are two of the most prominent examples. The authors completely stand on the anti-Party and anti-people stance, distorting our real life, and singing the praises of bourgeois individualists as heroes. It can be seen that right-wing elements and revisionists advocate exposing darkness, but they only expose the darkness of the working class and the laboring people, not the darkness of landlords and capitalists. They mock and oppose the depiction of new heroes, but they only oppose the depiction of new collective heroes, while for the "heroes" of bourgeois individualism, they can never sing their praises enough.

Our literary works should expose darkness. Since there are both bright and dark sides in our lives, literature should both sing the praises of the bright side and expose the dark side, and should describe the struggle between the bright and the dark. Literature should not reflect life one-sidedly. All phenomena that hinder social progress and are backward and negative should be criticized and exposed. Bureaucracy is one such phenomenon and should be exposed and criticized. Our literary works should become weapons to fight against all negative things and become weapons of criticism and self-criticism. We oppose the theory of no conflict. The question is from what stance and for what purpose to carry out exposure and criticism. Our writers should stand on the correct stance and distinguish right from wrong, truly distinguish what is the bright side and what is the dark side; do not record everything heard or even rejoice in misfortunes to exaggerate and magnify the dark side, cover up the bright side, and cause readers to misunderstand and lose hope in life. Our works should describe the various contradictions and difficulties, shortcomings, and errors in life, and can also describe failures and sacrifices, but should not make people feel disheartened, but should add courage and confidence to overcome difficulties. We are full of confidence in reality, so our literature is always optimistic. The dividing line between us and right-wing elements and revisionists on the issue of writing about darkness is here.

Whether it is the foreigner Fast or our own Feng Xuefeng, they all oppose the authenticity of art and the correctness of politics, as if a writer who has a correct political stance cannot maintain authenticity in art. Fast, after leaving the party, announced that he would no longer "write according to what is 'correct'." He demands the right to make political mistakes. Feng Xuefeng also advises writers not to first consider whether something is politically correct or incorrect. Qin Zhaoyang, who advocates amending the principle of socialist realism, speaks more cleverly. He said that if a writer has socialist spirit and aspirations in his mind, it is as if objective authenticity is not absolutely worth valuing, and what is more important is the writer's fixed and abstract "socialist spirit" and aspirations, and if necessary, the vivid and objective authenticity must be made to serve this abstract and fixed subjective thing; the result would be that literary works would deviate from objective authenticity and even become a mouthpiece for some political concepts. ("Realism - A Broad Road") According to Qin Zhaoyang's meaning, "objective authenticity" and the writer's "socialist spirit" seem to be incompatible, and only so-called "objective authenticity" is "absolutely" worth valuing, and what "socialist spirit" and aspirations are, at most, only "relatively" worth valuing. In his view, the cause of the conceptual and formulaic nature of works, hindering the authenticity of works, is not something else, but this socialist spirit. He hates and dislikes this socialist spirit. If there were no this "fixed, abstract, subjective thing," it would be so good! Then the writer could say "what he really wants to say," could write about "the themes that make him most excited"! Of course, a writer should and can only write about "the themes that make him most excited." But what makes you most excited? Why are the masses of new socialist things not of any interest to you, while the fate of an individualist intellectual in a revolutionary collective makes you excited to the point of sleepless nights? A writer should be sincere and frank, expressing his thoughts in the most clear and unambiguous form. A true writer standing on the people's side will never hide his views. But in the eyes of right-wing elements and revisionists, if a writer speaks of supporting the Communist Party, supporting the people, and supporting socialism, then that is not speaking "sincerely," but if a writer speaks of opposing the Communist Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism, then that is "sincerely." They themselves do not dare to speak such "sincere words" directly, so they have to speak vaguely, and every move is "looking left and right, anxious." This is a true reflection of the psychology of those with hidden motives.

How should we view the issue of creative freedom?

In our country, literature and science enjoy full freedom. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is an important guarantee of this freedom. Our country provides the most superior conditions for the publication of literature and other books. According to the constitution, the state only restricts or prohibits works that are anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist, because this is not allowed by the fundamental interests of the people. However, what the right-wing elements hope for is precisely the freedom to publish such works.

We demand that literature be socialist literature, not bourgeois literature, and that literature serve the broad laboring people, not a few "upper-class" people. For bourgeois writers, for right-wing elements and revisionists, this is indeed a restriction on their freedom. They can no longer freely advocate reactionary bourgeois ideas and freely write anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist works, because such works will be criticized and opposed by the masses. However, for writers of the working class, for writers who are willing to serve the laboring people, this is not a restriction on their freedom but precisely an expansion of their freedom. It is precisely socialist thought, precisely the purpose of serving socialism and the laboring people, that enables our writers to break free from the shackles of bourgeois individualist worldviews, establish close ties with the laboring people, and draw an endless source of creation from the lives and struggles of the laboring people. This is the true freedom of creation. Writers feel unfree precisely because they are shackled by bourgeois individualist ideas, precisely because they are unfamiliar with the lives of the laboring people, and they can only express themselves or a few people around them, so their freedom is very limited. Writers can only have true and broad freedom when they combine with the times and the people.

Right-wing elements and revisionists believe that if literature serves politics and serves socialism, it is not free. Feng Xuefeng once blamed us for not respecting the "rights and freedoms of creation," for imposing "thought control" on writers, saying that we require writers to write for the current revolutionary tasks, which is to create "command literature." He forgot that the great Lu Xun called his works "command literature," and he regarded creating according to the commands of the pioneers as his glory. Of course, we should not narrowly interpret serving politics as requiring writers to propagate the Party and the state's every specific, individual, and only temporarily partial policy, and even less should we require writers to write according to the provisions of the policy. If such a requirement is made, it will be harmful to creation and is wrong, because such "creation" will have no one to read, and people will say that we might as well read the editorials in the newspapers. What the people demand from literature is obviously something of a different nature. The people demand to see the vast and rich picture of socialist life in literature, to learn from it how to understand and deal with new life, rather than to seek answers to things like how to adjust prices and how to prevent infectious diseases. However, the "creative freedom" demanded by right-wing elements and revisionists is actually to make literature detach from socialism, detach from the current struggles of the people, and get rid of the leadership of the Party. They are determined to implement the bourgeois literary line, and the leadership of the Party will naturally make them feel "unfree." Therefore, they always use various excuses and reasons to attack the leadership of the Party over literary undertakings.

Some writers feel unfree because their works, after being published, often receive various criticisms, both written and verbal, from the masses and the leadership, making them feel a great spiritual pressure. Pressure is never pleasant. But we also need to analyze it. Irrational and rude criticism is harmful to creation. Such pressure should be opposed. Another kind is correct and appropriate criticism, including the opinions of the leadership and the masses. Some writers think this is also pressure. But this "pressure," we should not oppose. Works are reflections of social existence through artistic forms, and at the same time, they influence society. They cannot avoid being judged by public opinion. Whether it is praise or criticism, there will inevitably be incorrect places. We need a healthy public opinion, and at the same time, writers need the courage not to fear criticism. Writers and artists with a high sense of responsibility to the people should value others' opinions and welcome criticism. Comrade Mao Zedong said at the national propaganda conference in March 1957, "A thorough materialist is fearless." We should all strive to be such materialists.

As for the selection of materials in works, and the methods and styles of expression, writers should have complete freedom. We advocate writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers, but this does not exclude writers from writing various other subjects according to their different experiences, strengths, and interests. We believe that socialist realism is the best method of creation, but this can only be advocated to writers, encouraging writers to improve their Marxist-Leninist ideological cultivation, establish close ties with the laboring people, and make socialist thought truly become the flesh and blood and soul of writers, rather than issuing a mandatory order to writers. Socialist realism can only be embodied in the concrete creative practice of each writer, and cannot be subjectively demanded. In terms of artistic style, we encourage diversity and individual creativity.

The above is the main disagreement between us and right-wing elements and revisionists in literary thought. It can be seen that this disagreement is most prominent and concentrated in the views on the relationship between literature and politics. Revisionists try to make literature detach from revolutionary politics. Dogmatists simply believe that as long as there is politics, there is art. They ignore the importance of the characteristics and techniques of artistic creation. Their formula is politics is art, which is actually to abolish art, and this is of course wrong. The formula of revisionists is art is politics, which is to make politics serve art, and actually to make revolutionary politics serve the counterrevolutionary politics hidden under the cloak of art. Dogmatists believe that Marxism can not only include but also replace the method of creation, and they replace the whole with the part, which has the danger of leading writers to deviate from the path of realism. Revisionists, on the other hand, believe that the method of creation can include and even replace Marxism, and they replace the whole with the part, with the purpose of inducing writers to deviate from the correct political direction. The correct formula should be, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Marxism can only include but cannot replace realism in literary creation." Although dogmatists and revisionists stand on completely opposite positions, their methods of looking at problems are both metaphysical and one-sided; they always regard politics and art as opposed or identical. Marxists regard politics and art as a unity of opposites; they regard the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form as the goal of creation; they measure all works with the unity of political standards and artistic standards, with political standards as the first, and this is correct.

The struggle between the proletarian line and the bourgeois line in our country's literature is long-standing. This is a struggle between two lines in literature. The proletarian literary line has experienced its infancy, committed dogmatism, sectarianism, and other errors, and it was only after Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talk at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published in 1942 that it laid a solid theoretical foundation and was completely proven correct in practice. The errors of dogmatism need to be continued to overcome. But the more dangerous thing at present is revisionism. Revisionism is the reflection of bourgeois trends within the working class, and its characteristic is to use the banner of Marxism to oppose "dogmatism" and "sectarianism" to oppose Marxism and oppose the leadership of the Party. The main content of the revisionist literary line is to deny the noble mission of literature serving the laboring people and serving revolutionary politics, to deny the class nature of literature in class society, to deny or distort national cultural traditions, to deny the ideological reform of writers, and to deny the leading role of the Party in literary undertakings. Over the past twenty-plus years, we have argued with Hu Feng and Wang Shuo on this issue, and we have also argued with Feng Xuefeng on this issue. Feng Xuefeng and Hu Feng's thoughts are in the same line, representing a revisionist bourgeois line. (They themselves boast of representing what realism orthodoxy is, but in reality, they represent the anti-realism line.) If the revisionist line gains power, it will lead our literary undertakings to the direction of the bourgeoisie and will cause the literary ranks to split. Therefore, we must, while continuing to overcome dogmatism, focus on opposing revisionism. Only in this way can our socialist literary undertakings advance, and the ranks can be united. We have exposed the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, Feng Xuefeng, and others, which has removed the dangerous factors of sectarian splits in the literary ranks and ensured that our literary ranks march forward closely under the banner of socialism.

The struggle against the right-wing elements in the literary circles has achieved victory, clearing the way for the smooth development of socialist literary undertakings. We must consolidate this victory. Now, the people of the whole country are in the high tide of production and construction. We want to achieve a great leap forward in literary and artistic undertakings as well. The people of our country are transforming the world and changing the face of history with an irresistible momentum, and their high labor enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit are inevitably reflected in literature and art, this special form of ideology. The laboring people, while creating material wealth, are also constantly creating spiritual wealth. The urgent demand of the working people for culture is unprecedented, and their various amateur cultural and artistic activities are developing in large quantities and vigorously. If our literature and art want to achieve a new leap, they must, on a larger scale and in a deeper way, combine with the working people. Literary works must be able to meet the people's demands in both quantity and quality.

Comrade Mao Zedong has long called on writers to "long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the fiery struggles." Now, tens of thousands of leading cadres and intellectuals across the country are going to the countryside and mountains, participating in manual labor and grassroots work. Literary and artistic workers are also going to the countryside and factories in large numbers, establishing their bases of life, preparing to live with the laboring people for a long time. Writers combining with the workers and peasants in labor, struggle, and life for a long time has become the fundamental principle of our literary work.

The combination of literary and artistic workers with the working people is a good embodiment of the combination of mental labor and physical labor, individual talent and collective wisdom. Our society highly respects the individual talents of writers and artists because only by highly developing individual creativity can our literature and art be rich and colorful. However, we have always believed that individual talent is the concentration of collective wisdom, and if individual talent is detached from the foundation of collective wisdom, it is like a tree without roots and water without a source, and it will certainly not have a great future. Only by truly combining with the workers and peasants, the talents of writers and artists will be inexhaustible.

The proletarian literary and artistic workers should study hard. The people do not need empty literary and artistic workers. We want to be both "red" and "expert," to master the Marxist worldview and to master high-level creative techniques. Only when our writers and artists reach a mature level in politics, ideology, and technique, can we have a truly powerful proletarian literary and artistic force. To achieve this goal, there is no shortcut other than studying. We should learn from Marxism-Leninism, learn from the people, and learn from all the great and beneficial legacies and traditions of China and the world. We not only need to learn from books but mainly need to learn from struggles, practice, and mutual competition and debate. Our writers and artists should have high courage in creation and theory, dare to break conventions, boldly create, dare to innovate, dare to imagine, and dare to criticize. We should regard creating works worthy of this great era as an irresistible responsibility, and we will surely complete this task excellently.

    文艺战线上的一场大辩论
    （根据1957年9月16日在中共中国作家协会党组扩大会议上的讲话整理、补充并和文艺界的一些同志交换了意见之后写成）
    周扬
    在全国反击资产阶级右派的斗争中，文艺界揭露和批判了丁玲、陈企霞反党集团及其他右派分子，并且取得了很大的胜利。这是文艺战线上的一场大是大非之争，社会主义文艺路线和反社会主义文艺路线之争。这场斗争，是当前我国无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争在文艺领域内的反映。
    文艺是时代的风雨表。每当阶级斗争形势发生急剧的变化，就可以在这个风雨表上看出它的征兆。
    社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争是长期的，时起时伏的。每经一次紧张的斗争，工人阶级就受到一次严重的锻炼和考验。不管道路多么曲折艰难，斗争的最后结局，总是革命战胜反革命，新事物、新思想战胜旧事物、旧思想。整个社会的发展如此，文艺的发展也不例外。历史潮流是不可抗拒的。反动派注定了失败的命运。社会主义的事业，社会主义的文艺事业，必将压倒一切反动势力的阻挠而取得胜利。
    一、大风浪中的考验
    最近一两年来国际国内经历了一系列重大的不平常的事件。我国在1956年完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，这是我国有史以来的大变化。生产关系改变了，生产力得到解放；广大工农群众欢欣鼓舞。资产阶级由于他们的阶级本性却不喜欢这种变化。他们当中识时务的人们努力使自己适应于这种形势；他们看到了只有改造自己，他们在新社会中才有光明的前途。但是资产阶级右派及其在知识界的代表是不甘心这么作的，他们不肯放弃剥削制度和剥削思想，厌恶社会主义新制度而迷恋资本主义旧制度，妄想资本主义在中国复辟。一切赢得人民欢呼的新事物，他们一件也看不顺眼。他们觉得一切都
  “今不如昔”，就像九斤老太一样，总觉得如今的世道是“一代不如一代”。他们所一向依附的旧经济基础正在被消灭，而他们又不愿意依附到新的经济基础上来，他们看不起工农群众，但又不能不感到工农群众的力量。这就是一部分资产阶级知识分子思想苦闷，精神动荡的根本原因，也是他们一遇到风吹草动就乘机向人民进攻的原因。因此，为了巩固和发展社会主义制度，使社会主义的上层建筑能和基础相适应，在政治上、思想上进行一场社会主义革命，就是必要的和不可避免的。
    国内外的反动派总是要寻找一切机会向社会主义发动进攻。每当共产党内纠正错误、整顿作风、进行公开的批评和自我批评的时候，反动派便以为他们进攻的时机到来了。帝国主义者利用苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对斯大林的批判，在国际上掀起了一股反苏反共的逆流。这个反动浪潮的高峰，就是匈牙利事件。如何对待匈牙利事件，成了测量一个人是否真正的共产主义者、真正的革命家的重要标准。全世界绝大多数的共产主义者，在这个严重关头表现了他们对于国际共产主义运动的忠诚和坚定，他们是经得起风险的。但是也有不少的人经不起考验。他们在思想上发生了混乱，政治上动摇了，其中少数的人公开叛变。这种现象在西方进步知识界的一部分人中表现得很突出。美国作家霍华德·法斯特就是一个可耻的叛徒。他在叛党声明中诉说“我毕生建立起来的信仰完全粉碎了”。这是古往今来一切叛徒的忏悔口吻。显然，他粉碎了的只是披在他身上的一层薄薄的马克思主义的外衣，并不是什么社会主义的真正信仰；他的灵魂深处浸透了资产阶级自由主义的腐朽思想。这样的人退出了工人阶级的队伍，不是坏事，而是好事。
    我党中央连续发表了“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”和“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”两文，分析了国际共产主义运动中发生的新问题，指出了社会主义社会的两种性质不同的矛盾，从而澄清了党内外的某些思想上的混乱。党中央和毛泽东同志提出的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策和接着发布的在全党进行整风运动的指示，对于我国社会主义制度的巩固和发展起了无可估量的作用。
    但是，我国知识界的那些反社会主义的分子却从国际反共浪潮得到了鼓舞。从1956年春季以后，特别是从匈牙利事件以后，他们的心就痒得熬不住了。他们按照自己的主观愿望把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的正确政策加以曲解。本来，我们提倡学术上不同意见的自由争论和艺术上不同风格的自由竞赛，是为了发展社会主义文化。我们将长期地坚定不移地实行这个方针。我们认为，垄断、独占，没有竞赛，没有比较，就不可能引导科学艺术走向繁荣，而只会使它们走向衰退。我们相信工人阶级有力量能够通过自由竞赛、自由辩论的方式在文化艺术上战胜资产阶级。资产阶级右派却把“百花齐放、百家争鸣”解释成对马克思主义思想运动的否定；他们十分讨厌思想改造运动。他们说“严冬”就要“解冻”，“春天”即将来临。他们的目的并不在开展甚么学术辩论和艺术竞赛，而只是企图利用这个口号来卷起一场反社会主义的政治浪潮。因此，当我党开始进入整风并广泛发动群众提意见的时候，他们就认为按照自己的面貌改造共产党的时机来到了。他们的矛头首先指向思想文化领域。他们急于要夺取思想阵地。他们认为这道防线是比较薄弱，容易突破的。接着，他们就向整个社会主义事业展开了全面的攻击。这在某种意义上说，对于我们也不是坏事，而是好事。右派暴露了自己的真面目，并从反面教育了人民。
    走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？作革命派，还是作反动派？这是摆在每个中国人面前，要求抉择的迫切问题。在民主革命阶段，谁反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，谁就是革命派。现在是到了社会主义革命阶段。要作革命派，就必须反对资本主义，走社会主义的道路。你要走资本主义道路，就是反动派。两者之中，必择其一。中间道路是没有的。
    过社会主义这一关，对我国知识分子来说，是比过民主革命这一关更为严重得多的考验。
    果然在知识界、文艺界，出了不少的右派，其中有些是共产党员，他们扮演了和党外右派里应外合向党进攻的活跃的角色。锺惦棐的“电影的锣鼓”（载1956年12月“文艺报”）是敲得较早的，可以看作右派进攻的一个信号。这篇文章把解放以来的电影事业的成就一笔抹杀，肆意攻击党对文艺工作的领导，企图把电影事业拉回到资本主义的老路。
    在这个期间，修正主义思想开始在文艺界抬起头来。右派分子和修正主义者，反对文艺为工农兵、为社会主义服务的路线。他们说“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”已经“过时”了。社会主义现实主义的创作原则应当修改或者放弃。他们在所谓“写真实”、“干预生活”等等的口号下，提倡“揭露生活的阴暗面”，认为只有这样才是“现实主义的新路”。一时间，真是“山雨欲来风满楼”。文艺界的风正在向右刮。看到这种现象，一些“左”的教条主义者着慌了，想用简单粗暴的压服方法镇压这股歪风。当然教条主义和压服方法是克服不了修正主义的。教条主义者害怕鸣放，是由于他们不相信工人阶级和人民群众的力量，不相信马克思列宁主义的力量。所以他们表面上的“左”正是反映了他们骨子里的“右”。党坚决地采取了放手让他们鸣放的方针，因为他们力争鸣放，发了狂了，恨不得一口气吃掉共产党。他们完全不讲道理了。他们背叛了社会主义，背叛了宪法，背叛了自己的诺言。党早就公开说明，我们不怕毒草，要把毒草锄翻，变成肥料；我们不怕牛鬼蛇神，要请牛鬼蛇神做人民的反面教师。我们看到毒草已经长出来了，那么，就让它长罢。因为毒草是一种客观存在，毒草盛长，就标志着工人阶级锄草队伍要出动了。想把客观存在的毒草泥封土掩，不许露头，或者一露头就用简单办法一下子压死，是一种不懂阶级斗争策略的蠢笨作法，而且一定会留下后祸，将来要付出更多的劳动才能把它锄掉。党相信群众有识别毒草，克服毒草的力量。党是懂得如何对付阶级敌人的。就是这样，文艺界的右派分子同社会各界的右派分子一样，就原形毕露，张牙舞爪地乘机活动起来，形成了两军对垒。两方面都高兴。右派即反动派高兴的是共产党眼看垮台，资本主义可以复辟了。革命派高兴的是牛鬼蛇神大队出笼，有机会灭掉它们了。
    右派分子妄想匈牙利事件在中国重演。正如匈牙利的反动派盗用了柯苏特、裴多菲的招牌作为他们进行反革命的武器一样，中国的右派分子在1957年也利用党的整风运动煽动一次反对社会主义的所谓“新的五四运动”。这时，正像李又然形容的，丁玲的眼睛都因为高兴而发亮了。冯雪峰的情绪也从来没有这样兴奋，他说“洪水冲到了大门口”。他鼓动一切对党、对人民政权心怀不满的分子“有冤报冤，有仇报仇”，用“狂风暴雨”式的“大民主”来反对党和国家的领导。连一向不大过问世事的陈涌也说：“大变动的前夜到来了。”锺惦棐在他后来的检讨中说：“在我的脑子里经历了一场匈牙利事件。”这是真实的自白。所以党内右派和党外右派里应外合是很自然的。丁玲、陈企霞反党集团和“文汇报”的右派密通声息，想借“文汇报”来为他们公开声援，以便达到他们分裂文艺界和推翻党的领导的目的。艾青在这一活动中起了穿针引线的作用。冯雪峰在人民文学出版社成了右派的靠山。江丰反党集团在中央美术学院和民盟中的右派亲密合作到了“盟党合流”的程度。这些号称共产党员的人，在工人阶级的事业遭到敌人攻击的时候，不挺身起来保卫工人阶级的利益，却反而里应外合向党进攻，这不是叛变是什么呢？
    丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰等人的反党活动，并不是现在才开始的。十五年前，正当革命处在极艰苦的年月，全世界面临法西斯的奴役，希特勒的军队侵占了苏联大块国土，延安被国民党反动派重重封锁，敌后根据地的人民和军队正和日本侵略者进行着最残酷的斗争，正是在这个时候，丁玲、陈企霞等人在延安和王实味、萧军等坏分子串通一气，在他们主编的报刊上连续发表了“野百合花”、“三八节有感”等一系列反党文章，从背后向革命射击。他们的这些文章很快受到了国民党反动派的喝采。与这同时，冯雪峰在国民党统治区支持胡风集团，同样向人民放出了反党、反马克思主义的毒素。他们在不同地区，却挑选了同一时机，互相呼应，向党进攻，这事正说明了一条历史的规律：当阶级斗争到了尖锐化的阶段，革命到了转折的关头，总有一批混在党内的阶级异己分子和不坚定的分子在大风浪中经不住考验，暴露出他们的原形来。
    十五年前是历史的一个转折点。斯大林格勒一战扭转了世界的局面。我党的第一次整风运动奠定了中国人民革命胜利的基础。十五年后的今天，又是历史的一个转折点。以匈牙利事件而达到顶点的反苏反共逆流被击退了。社会主义国家和各国共产党表现了空前的团结和强大。苏联在科学技术上的成就走到了世界的最前面。我党又发动了第二次整风运动，而且胜利地击溃了右派的进攻，使社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。在两次的历史转折关头，在我党的两次整风运动中，丁玲等人两次扮演了反党的角色，这决不是偶然的。
    这次右派分子在文艺界放火，比十五年前的火头来势更猛，但是今天的革命力量也远非十五年前可比了。纵火者结果烧着了自己。丁玲等人的反党面貌被最后地彻底地揭露出来。
    经过反右派的大辩论，我们大家，包括我自己在内，都受到了极深刻的教育。绝大多数的作家、艺术家更坚定地站到了社会主义方面。社会主义热情在文艺界高涨起来。右派分子只有彻底悔改，重新作人，才有出路；别的出路是没有的。党和人民愿意帮助他们改造，但主要要靠他们自己的努力。二、两种不可调和的世界观
    人们也许要问：丁玲、冯雪峰都是老党员，老左翼作家，他们怎么堕落成为右派分子的呢？从他们的事件中，我们可以吸取一些甚么教训呢？
    回顾一下我们这些人走过来的道路。我们中间的许多人出身于没落的封建地主或其他剥削阶级的家庭，就教养和世界观来说，基本上都是资产阶级知识分子。“五四”新文化运动给我们带来了科学和民主，也带来了社会主义的新思潮。那时我们急迫地吸取一切从外国来的新知识，一时分不清无政府主义和社会主义、个人主义和集体主义的界线。尼采、克鲁泡特金和马克思在当时几乎是同样吸引我们的。到后来我们才认识了马克思列宁主义是解放人类的唯一真理和武器。我们投身于工人阶级的解放事业，但存在于我们脑子里的资产阶级个人主义的思想、情绪和习惯却没有根本改变。我们有了一个抽象的共产主义的信仰；但支配我们行动的却仍然常常是个人英雄主义的冲动。我们和工人农民没有结合，甚至很少接近。民主革命是我们切身的要求，而社会主义革命还只是一个理想。那个时候，我们许多人与其说是无产阶级革命派，不如说是小资产阶级革命民主派。个人主义的影响在我们身上长期不能摆脱。回想当年，个人主义曾经和“个性解放”、“人格独立”等等的概念相联系，在我们反对封建压迫、争取自由的斗争中给予过我们鼓舞的力量。十九世纪欧洲文学的许多杰出作品经常描写个人和社会的冲突，愤世嫉俗，孤军奋斗和无政府式的反抗，这在我们的头脑中留下了深刻的印象。我们曾经热烈地欢迎易卜生，欣赏他那句“世上最孤立的人就是最有力量的”的名言。我们中间许多人就是经过个人奋斗走上革命道路，背着个人主义的包袱参加革命的。
    资产阶级的个人主义和无产阶级的集体主义是无法调和的。我们不只要进行资产阶级民主革命（这个革命在我国也是只能由无产阶级领导的），而且要进行社会主义革命。我们身上存在的资产阶级个人主义思想就成了我们前进道路上的最大障碍。
    在对待资产阶级个人主义的问题上，两种人的态度是截然不同的：一种人在长期的革命过程中，经过党的教育，实际斗争的锻炼和自我改造，逐渐成为集体主义的战士。他们决心丢掉个人主义的包袱，改造自己的思想，决心服从无产阶级集体事业的利益。他们的思想感情经历了从一个阶级到另一个阶级的革命转化。丢掉个人主义的包袱，并不那么容易。他们常常是在碰了壁，摔了跤之后，才慢慢丢掉的。丢掉了包袱，人就轻松愉快了。他们就能够和集体打成一片，同党一条心了。他们在集体身上找到无穷的力量。这样，把个人利益服从于集体的利益，他们才觉得不是勉强的，而是自然的，应该如此的。从此，他们在任何情况下都能对人民的事业忠心耿耿。另一种人却不是这样。他们始终丢不掉个人主义的包袱，纠缠于个人得失，个人恩怨；即使碰了壁，摔了跤，包袱也还是不肯丢，反而越背越重。他们不肯按照集体主义的精神改造自己，却总想按照个人主义的面貌改造党，改造我们的革命事业。他们一切以自我为中心，和集体格格不入，同党不是一条心。他们稍有成就，就居功自满；而当他们犯了错误，受到了批评的时候，就怨气冲天。他们经不起任何严重的考验。到了重要关头，他们不惜背叛工人阶级。
    在我们党内，第一类人以及愿意努力去作第一类人的占大多数。但第二类人也不少。丁玲、冯雪峰就属于第二类人。在1955年作家协会党组扩大会上，我曾经说，一个共产党员最重要的是对党忠诚。丁玲对这句话颇有反感；她在1957年大鸣大放期间气势汹汹地质问我为什么要提“忠诚”这些话。丁玲自己心里当然明白。原来作贼心虚，她怕听“忠诚”二字。丁玲正是一个彻头彻尾的个人主义者，一个一贯对党不忠的人。
    许多同志提到了“莎菲女士的日记”。要了解丁玲的性格和思想，读一读她三十年前的这篇成名之作，倒是很有帮助的。书中的主人公是一个可怕的虚无主义的个人主义者。她说谎，欺骗，玩弄男性，以别人的痛苦为快乐，以自己的生命当玩具。这个人物虽然以旧礼教的叛逆者的姿态出现，实际上只是一个没落阶级的颓废倾向的化身。当然，作家可以描绘各种的社会典型；问题在于作者对于自己所描写的人物采取甚么态度。显然，丁玲是带着极大的同情描写了这个应当否定的形象的。如果说这篇小说表现的是她早年的思想，那么她入党很久以后，特别是在革命根据地生活了几年以后，却写了像“我在霞村的时候”和“在医院中”这样的作品，就说明她的极端个人主义思想后来不但没有改好，反而发展到和工人阶级，和劳动群众尖锐对立的地步。“我在霞村的时候”这篇小说，把一个被日本侵略者抢去作随营娼妓的女子，当作女神一般地加以美化。值得注意的是，冯雪峰在“丁玲文集后记”中，却说作者所描写的这个“灵魂”，是如何如何的“丰富和有光芒的伟大”。这就看出，他们的口味是如何相投了。丁玲在1941年写的“在医院中”，更是集中地表现了她对工人阶级，对劳动人民的敌视。这篇小说是丁玲的极端个人主义的反动世界观的缩影。小说把一个有着严重的反党情绪的年轻的女共产党员陆萍描写为一个新社会的英雄人物，仅仅是因为组织上分配工作的时候没有满足她的不切实际的幻想，作者就忍不住替她的主人公抱不平，把党和革命的需要咒骂为套在脖子上的“铁箍”。在个人利益和集体利益发生抵触的情况下，陆萍对延安的一切投以仇视的眼光，并且在医院中展开了一系列的反党活动。小说把革命根据地的劳动群众写成愚蠢的、麻木的人，把延安写成一个残酷无情、阴森可怕的地方，延安的革命干部从上到下都是没有希望的。因此，作者支持她的女主人公“同所有的人”作斗争。丁玲写道：“她寻仇似的四处找着缝隙来进攻，她指摘着一切。她每天苦苦寻思，如何能攻倒别人，她永远相信，真理是在自己这一边的。”丁玲这篇小说，正是宣传了她反党、反人民的“真理”，狂热的资产阶级个人主义的“真理”。从莎菲开始，在丁玲所描写的不少女主人公的经历和性格上都有作者自己的影子。她十分欣赏莎菲式的女性。她对臭名昭著的右派分子林希翎的赞赏决不是偶然的。她把这种类型的女性当作最可爱的坚强性格加以颂扬。可以说，多少年来，莎菲女士的灵魂始终附在丁玲的身上，只是后来她穿上了共产主义者的衣裳，因而她的面貌就不那么容易为人们所识别，而她作起坏事来危害也就更大了。
    顽强的个人主义者，在革命斗争中，一遇到严重的考验，就变成极脆弱的人了。丁玲早在1933年在南京向国民党自首，从特务机关的阶下囚一变而为他们的座上客，背叛了共产党和工人阶级，就是这种脆弱性的表现。后来丁玲到了延安，隐瞒了这段历史，骗取了党的信任。1942年，她发表“三八节有感”一类的文章，和王实味、萧军等人共同反党，表现得十分顽强，这可以说是她叛党行为的继续和发展。党对她进行了坚决的斗争。但是当她表示愿意改正错误的时候，党仍然努力挽救她，鼓励她到群众中去改造自己。“太阳照在桑干河上”就是在党的这种帮助之下写出来的。
    全国解放和一本“桑干河上”给丁玲带来了名誉和地位。她在解放后一两年内多少作了一些工作。但她的个人主义也随着更加发展了。她忘记了党对她的批评和教育，变得骄横不可一世。她利用党和人民所交托的岗位，极力培植自己的小圈子，企图实现她的称霸文坛的野心。她和陈企霞、冯雪峰把他们当时主编的“文艺报”变成了独立王国。1954年党和文艺界检查
  “文艺报”工作中的错误，这就大大地触怒了他们。他们的“王国”是谁也碰不得的。从此，他们怀恨在心。他们的反党小集团的活动愈来愈露骨了。反革命的胡风也把他们当作可以争取合作的“实力派”。1955年作家协会党组揭发了丁玲、陈企霞的反党活动并对他们进行了不妥协的斗争。当时，他们作了后来自称是“言不由衷”的检讨。正如陈企霞所自白的，他们心中充满了“疯狂的报复主义”。到了右派进攻的时候，他们的反党活动就达到了顶点。
    这就是丁玲在南京、延安、北京的三个时期，在每个重要历史关头的表现。
    现在再从历史上看一看冯雪峰在政治上和思想上的发展。冯雪峰也曾经为革命作过一些工作，但是他的浓厚的个人主义、无政府主义思想和工人阶级的集体主义思想，和党的组织性、纪律性经常发生矛盾。冯雪峰在他的检讨中用了两句话来概括他和党的关系：“得意时个人在党之上，失意时个人在党之外。”他在1936年从当时革命根据地的陕北来到上海，以钦差大臣姿态出现，一方面把胡风引为同党，另一方面对当时上海地下党组织给以极恶劣的宗派打击，造成了革命文艺事业的分裂。这就是冯雪峰在他的所谓“得意”时期干的一件大事。1937年，他因为党没有满足他个人的地位野心，就自动脱党而去，作了革命的逃兵。抗日民族战争爆发，全国人心振奋，而他却离群索居，郁郁寡欢。从此就开始了他的所谓“失意”生涯。
    1943年冯雪峰从上饶集中营出来，并没有变得坚强一些，而是心情更灰暗，更消沉。他在这一年写出的那本题为“乡风与市风”的杂文集，充满了空虚、寂寞、悲观、绝望的情绪。他看到的是人民群众的愚味和麻木，是“奴性的卑贱的苟安”。他对整个民族丧失了信心。当时日本侵略者占领了我国大块地方并在我国土地上推行奴化教育。冯雪峰恰在这时提倡民族的“他化力”，主张民族文化的“他民族化”，宣传民族文化“也可以被强奸产生婴儿”（见“他化力”）。在这本书里，他还放肆地宣传了个人主义和唯心主义的思想，宣传了封建阶级的“士为知己者死”和个人野心家的哲学。说什么“死之专一”而且只限于“知己者”，就是“除了表现对于所依存势力的忠诚之外，更是尊重着对于自己的独立意志的忠诚了”。而他说，这“是我们历史的一个胜利”。他还说什么“英雄们的野心，也正是有志的士人所要拥抱的那些正气之另一面的表现；同时，英雄们的野心一接触到人生的功利，实在是使德行赋有了新的生命”（见“谈士节兼论周作人”）。这是说的甚么话呢？毋怪乎全国解放后，丁玲、冯雪峰、陈企霞等人大大发展了个人野心，向青年们大大宣传“士为知己者死”，原来早就有了他们反动的哲学根据的。
    冯雪峰在1944年、1945年写的“有进无退”这本论文集里，宣传个人主义的主观战斗精神，歌颂小资产阶级的疯狂性，在许多地方，和胡风的口吻一模一样。我们知道，胡风是提倡疯狂性、痉挛性的。冯雪峰也说今天的时代和社会，“要求着疯子以上的大疯狂者，要求着强者以上的强者，要求着大疯狂者的肉搏，要求着最强者的反抗”（见“发疯”）。当1945年苏联红军攻克柏林的时候，由于美国阴谋家和纳粹匪徒的纵火，柏林一些地方变成了一片火海，冯雪峰不但不斥责敌人的暴行，却去赞美那“史诗般”的火狱，“史诗般”的恐怖。他把苏军解放希特勒德国的胜利说成是“真的恐怖的鞭子”；把解放了的柏林说成是“人类的恐怖之城”。这流露了他对于革命的恐惧和疯狂的心理。这哪里有一点点共产主义者的味道呢？冯雪峰在1944年发表了一篇题为“论友爱”的文章。这时他从敌人的集中营刚刚出来不久，但在这篇文章里，他没有表现一点对于阶级敌人的仇恨，却反而强调宣传什么“广大的人类的友爱”，说这是人的唯一的“根本的要求”，这已经很使人难以理解了。更加奇怪的是，他特别强调对朋友的“友爱”和“忠诚”，他说即使对一个想要叛党投敌的朋友，“假如不先对朋友或同志下劝告和阻止，却只将他的企图当作情报似的东西向社会或团体告发，这对于社会或团体也许可说是忠诚的，但对于朋友或同志却是居心险恶，近于可怕”。显然在他的头脑里，只有私人友情的利益，没有党和人民的利益。事实上，我们从冯雪峰前前后后的言行，只看到他对资产阶级的忠诚，却没有看到他对无产阶级的忠诚；只看到他对自己、对自己的好朋友胡风、丁玲等人的友爱和忠诚，却没有看到他对党对人民的忠诚。我在这里较多地引证了冯雪峰在1943—45年这个期间所写的一些文章，为的是好让大家看看在那乌云罩满全世界的年月，这位“共产主义者”的真实思想和情绪。
    1949年全国解放，冯雪峰不但没有感到兴奋，反而感到沮丧，如他自己所说，有一种像“小石子似的被踢在一旁”的心情，这就并不奇怪了。他用阴暗的眼光看革命的胜利，看一切新的事物。阴暗正是冯雪峰这一类个人主义者的心理特征。当我国进入社会主义革命阶段，冯雪峰对社会主义制度和社会主义文化更加处处感到抵触和厌恶。他的情绪越来越低沉，又越来越暴躁。而当右派进攻的时候，他的压抑很久的反党情绪就暴发出来。他和丁玲等人的反党结合，也就完全暴露。
    丁玲、冯雪峰虽然有二三十年的党龄，但从他们的世界观和长期的言行看来，他们实际是党内的资产阶级的文学贵族，是党
  内的资产阶级个人主义野心家。他们在敌人面前表现得十分脆弱，在革命内部却经常兴风作浪。他们拒绝按照党和革命的要求改造自己的思想，反而要按照他们的资产阶级个人主义的面貌来改造党，改造我们的社会，而首先就要改造人民的文艺事业。
    许多同志正确地批评了丁玲的“一本书主义”。这是很有意义的。这是两种世界观的斗争，是对待文艺事业的两种根本不同的态度：究竟是把文学事业看成整个人民事业的一部分呢，还是把它当作个人猎取名利的手段呢？究竟是用前一种态度，即共产主义思想去培养青年作家呢，还是用后一种态度，即资产阶级个人主义思想去培养青年作家呢？
    我们希望每个作家都写出好书，而且不止一本。没有作品，还有什么文学事业呢？但一本书主义却是损害我们的文学事业的，而且在这种思想支配下也决不可能产生出好作品。“一本书主义”者把写书看做满足个人名利欲望的工具，以为写了一本书就可以伸手向人民要东西，高踞于人民之上。“有了一本书，谁也打不倒。”这就是他们的口号。在文艺界，这种人并不少：写了一本书，画了一幅画，拍了一部电影，有了一点名气就目空一切。个人的名望愈大，党和人民在他们心目中的地位就愈小。他们的思想感情离人民就愈远。他们觉得人民沾了他们的光，欠了他们的债。他们忘记了荣誉是人民给他们的。贪图名利和骄傲自满，就成为不少文艺工作者生活上和政治上堕落的重要原因。
    “一本书主义”者把写书看得比一切都更高贵，好像作品只是依靠个人的天才创作出来的。他们不了解，任何天才的创作，离开了当前人民群众的斗争，离开了世世代代劳动人民所共同创造的物质财富和精神财富的积累，是不可想像的。只有劳动人民，只有那些用自己的劳动、智慧和生命创造历史的人们，才是不朽的。书的不朽也只是因为它真实地纪录和描绘了劳动人民的丰功伟绩于万一，表达了人民的思想和情感，说出了人民心里要说的话而已。古人讲立德、立功、立言；首先是立德、立功，然后才是立言。没有人民之德、之功，又那里有什么“言”可立呢？如果不能做人民的代言人，你的“言”又如何立得住呢？在人民面前我们永远也不能有一丝一毫的骄傲。一个作家，如果从事写作只是为了赚稿费，为了想一举成名，如果写出一两本小书就沾沾自喜，骄傲起来，这样的作家就未免太可怜，太渺小了。这样的作家就决不是人民所需要的。至于写出了一两本书就用来当作反党的资本，那就更加不能容忍了。但是野心家们为了拉拢青年作为供他们驱使的工具，竟不惜利用青年的弱点，利用他们的缺少经验和好胜心来向他们灌输骄傲的思想，引导他们走上反动的道路。丁玲、陈企霞等人就是这样腐蚀青年的。这应该引为我们的教训。
    许多同志正确指出了冯雪峰的文艺思想和胡风的文艺思想在基本观点上是一致的。胡风是一个混进革命文学队伍中来的反革命分子。他巧妙地隐瞒了他的反动政治经历，骗取了信任，摇身一变而为“左翼”作家，从革命文学内部来进行瓦解破坏的活动。而冯雪峰则始终支持胡风，并且在文艺思想上和胡风唱一个调子。早在1936年冯雪峰就反对向作家提倡马克思主义世界观，认为强调世界观对创作的意义是“机械论的老调”。他和胡风一样对党的马克思主义文艺路线采取蔑视和嘲笑的态度。他们拒绝文艺为劳动人民服务的原则。他们口中的所谓“大众化”，实际是用他们的资产阶级思想去“化大众”；他们从来不提作家应当如何努力与大众的思想感情打成一片，却反复宣传作家应当用甚么“主观战斗力”，实际就是用狂热的资产阶级个人主义思想去“拥抱”现实，“改造”人民。他们一向轻视文艺的民族传统和民族形式。冯雪峰把作家对“大众化”和“民族形式”的追求责骂为小市民性的“市侩主义”。当1945年我党在重庆对胡风的反动文艺思想进行批判的时候，冯雪峰仍然站在胡风一边。他公开地为胡风辩护，反对党的文艺方针。全国解放后，党和文艺界委托冯雪峰以主编“文艺报”的重任。这时他虽然在口头上表示拥护文艺为工农兵服务的路线，但实际上还是反对的。他曾力图使“文艺报”成为宣传他们一伙人的文艺思想和扩大他们个人威信的地盘。他在1953年为第二次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会起草的文学报告草稿，在反对“主观主义”、“教条主义”的名义下，提出了他的一套修正主义的理论，对解放以来文艺工作的成绩全盘加以抹杀。他的报告没有被采用。正在那时，党中央提出了过渡时期的总任务。党要求文艺为社会主义改造和社会主义建设服务，克服和反对资产阶级思想；指出对于文艺上的新生力量应当积极加以扶植；对自己的成就不要自满，也不要妄自菲薄；要相信我们的时代一定能够产生伟大的作品。党的意见是完全正确的。但是冯雪峰等人却不听这些意见，还是继续坚持他们的错误的看法。他们在“文艺报”这个独立王国一意孤行，对资产阶级唯心主义思想投降，对新生力量加以压制和轻视。党和文艺界不得不出来纠正“文艺报”的错误，并且改组了“文艺报”的编辑部。这是全国解放以后，冯雪峰在文艺路线上和党的第一次明显的分歧。冯雪峰当时虽然公开做了一个检讨，但他和他那一伙人始终把“文艺报”的改组，看作党对他们的打击，而心怀不满。他们总是企图翻案，以便卷土重来。大鸣大放期间，“文艺报”编辑部的唐因、唐挚等右派分子一方面阴谋篡改“文艺报”的方向，另一方面密谋由冯雪峰挂帅创办所谓同人刊物；他们声言“要在文学上打天下”，要通过刊物“打开一个新局面”。可见右派分子利用刊物来闯天下的企图，是始终不肯放弃的。丁玲、陈企霞、江丰还计划在原定1957年10月召开的全国文学艺术工作者代表大会上公开制造文艺界大分裂的局面。反右派斗争才使他们的阴谋全部归于破产。
    现在可以明显地看出：丁玲、冯雪峰等人的堕落成为右派分子并不是偶然的。这是他们的资产阶级个人主义世界观和党的共产主义世界观长期对抗的必然结果。资产阶级个人主义者和个人主义思想严重的人，要过社会主义的关是不容易的。他们勉强地过了民主革命的关，但到了过社会主义这一关，他们头脑中的个人主义就和社会主义无法调和了。在民主革命阶段，他们和党、和人民也并不是一条心。但是那时候反对的是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，他们和党的矛盾还可以暂时缓和或掩盖。等到我国已经进入社会主义革命阶段，资产阶级变成了革命的对象。革命锋芒所向，资产阶级个人主义、自由主义及资产阶级思想的其他种种表现都在扫荡之列，这时他们发现革命所反对的正是在他们身上浓厚存在的东西。他们如果不肯改造自己的思想立场，就必然和社会主义制度发生冲突。社会主义革命愈深入，社会主义制度愈巩固，他们的个人主义就愈没有容身之地。他们和党、和人民的关系就必然要达到破裂的地步。吴祖光说组织力量愈庞大，个人的力量愈缩小。这句话当然是对社会主义制度的诬蔑。因为社会主义社会并不抹杀个人的力量，而只是使个人的力量在同集体的力量相结合中得到正确的、充分的发挥。社会主义所要求的个性是和集体相协调的个性，而不是和集体相对抗的个性。个人的才能、智慧只有在社会主义社会中才能得到最圆满的发展。但是如果把他所说的“个人”改成“个人主义”，倒是恰当的。要扩大社会主义，就要缩小个人主义。个人主义，在社会主义社会，是万恶之源。
    现在世界上存在社会主义体系和资本主义体系的对抗；国内资产阶级还存在。社会主义国家始终不渝地坚持不同社会制度和平共处的政策，但意识形态上的斗争却是无可避免的。资本主义制度和文化虽然已经没落和腐烂，但对于许多人还有很大的吸引力。因此，彻底地批判资产阶级思想，仍然是今后相当长的时期内思想工作的一个最根本、最重要的任务。三、文艺上的修正主义路线
      由于阶级立场和世界观的不同，我们和资产阶级右派分子在文艺思想上是存在着根本分歧的。有两条路线。一条是：文艺为工人、农民和一切劳动人民的利益服务，真实地表现群众的生活和斗争而又为群众所理解和喜爱，提高群众的思想情感，鼓舞群众建设新生活的信心。这种文艺是促进社会的发展和进步的。这就是我们所主张的社会主义的文艺路线，也就是马克思主义的文艺路线。另一条路线是：文艺不是为广大人民的利益和需要服务，而只是为少数人服务，只是为了表现自己，满足个人名利欲望和迎合少数人的趣味，不是鼓舞群众的革命热情，而是沮丧群众的战斗意志。这种文艺对于社会的发展不是促进而是促退。这就是右派分子所主张的资产阶级的文艺路线，也就是反马克思主义的或修正主义的文艺路线。
    无产阶级的文艺观和资产阶级反动派的文艺观历来是互相斗争的；社会主义文学就是在这种斗争中成长起来的。社会主义文学是真正劳动人民的文学，它吸引了一切为社会主义伟大目标所鼓舞、愿意为劳动人民服务的作家加入了这个文学的队伍，同时也不断地遭受了资产阶级文学贵族们的种种攻击、诽谤和嘲笑。二十多年来，我国无产阶级文学运动，曾经一面抗击反动统治者的血腥的迫害，一面同各种各色反动阶级的文学代理人进行尖锐的斗争。我们粉碎了封建买办文学和法西斯文学，我们驳倒了新月派、第三种人等资产阶级文学派别的谰言。当时，正如鲁迅所说，无产阶级文学运动成为了中国唯一的文学运动。没有任何一个反动的文学派别、文学集团能够和它相抗衡。在全国解放后，我们又批判了“武训传”的反动倾向，批判了“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级观点，彻底地揭露和批判了胡风反革命集团和他们的文艺思想，全面地批判了胡适思想。
    资产阶级是不会放弃或停止对于社会主义文艺的进攻的。在这次国际国内的反共逆流中，社会主义文艺又遭到了一次新的攻击。修正主义者出来大显身手。他们一般地并不公开反对社会主义文艺。他们反对的方法比较巧妙。他们片面夸大我们文艺工作中存在的缺点，借此把社会主义文艺涂上一脸污泥。我国右派分子和修正主义者拾取了外国资产阶级反动作家的唾余，对苏联和我国的社会主义文学加以诋毁。冯雪峰说苏联文学为社会主义奋斗的精神还赶不上旧俄文学的人道主义精神（在编辑会议上的讲话）。刘绍棠也鹦鹉学舌地说苏联文学在近二十年不如前二十年，说我国文学在延安文艺座谈会以后的十五年来也退化了（在北京市宣传会议上的发言）。吴祖光认为解放以来的文艺工作比任何时候都糟。冯雪峰说我们的文艺作品
  “真实性非常低”（第二次文代会报告草稿）。吴祖光把我们今天的文艺和社会都看成一片虚伪。他说在我们的文艺中看不到“真心话”，看不到“心里想说的话”（“谈后台”）。为什么作家不能说“心里想说的话”呢？据说是因为在我们的社会里没有“创作自由”。所以秦兆阳说作家们“一举一动，总是左顾右盼，心神不安”，“不敢写”“自己感到最激动的、最严正最尖锐的题材”，而只能写些“平平常常”的东西（见“日常谈话录”，笔名鉴余）。
    否定或贬低社会主义文艺的成就，说社会主义文艺不真实，说在我们的社会里没有“创作自由”，这就是资产阶级右派和修正主义者反对社会主义文艺的主要论点。很明显，他们攻击的目标不只对着文艺本身，而是对着整个社会主义制度。
    我们应当怎样来估计社会主义文学的成就呢？
    社会主义文学是历史上前所未有的一种新型的文学。过去任何时代的文学都不能和它相比。历来的文学作品中很少把工人、农民的劳动和斗争当作作品的主题。真正的劳动者，那些创造社会物质财富和精神财富的人，在过去的作品中没有得到应有的地位。地主、贵族、商人、资产阶级及其在政治上和思想上的代表人物占据了过去作品的绝大篇幅。这是不公平的。社会主义文学从根本上改变了这个不合理的现象。为劳动人民服务，是社会主义文学的根本方针。它以无限的热情肯定和歌颂了工人阶级的伟大斗争。它描写了建立在社会主义基础上的人与人之间的新的关系、新的道德和风习，描写了那些逐步摆脱了旧社会影响的新的人物、新的性格以及他们对旧事物旧思想的斗争。从来没有一种文学能够像社会主义文学那样有力地肯定生活，肯定现实，那样坚定地相信人类，相信未来，相信人民的无穷的创造力。从来没有一种文学在思想上和情感上能够像今天的文学这样彻底地解放，有这样乐观的精神，雄伟的气魄，远大的理想。我们的文学作为一种积极的精神教育的武器，受到了人民的最广泛的支持和热爱。现在一本较好的作品要发行十几万册或几十万册，一部较好的电影，观众达到几千万人次。这是过去的文学艺术事业根本不能比拟的。人民成了文艺的积极的主人；他们关心文艺，把文艺事业当作自己的伟大的创造事业的一个重要的组成部分。作家不再是站在人民之上或人民之外的人物，而是人民群众中间的一分子，他们把密切联系群众，努力为人民写作，当作自己的神圣职责。这样的文学，难道不是历史上从未有过的最先进最崇高的文学吗？
    社会主义文学的伟大成就，是任何人也抹煞不了的。西方的一些资产阶级作家和人民民主国家内的某些修正主义者，利用苏共二十次代表大会对斯大林的批判，大肆叫嚣，说苏联文学已经“停滞”，说社会主义现实主义表明苏联文学“退化”了，又说社会主义现实主义不过是少数人“捏造”的口号，实际上这种文学是不存在的。他们中的一些人不但反对文学中的社会主义倾向，而且根本否定现实主义，认为现实主义是“过时”的方法，而醉心于时髦的现代主义及其它各种颓废主义的倾向。他们的这种叫嚣丝毫无损于苏联文学的光辉，而适足以暴露他们反动的资产阶级观点和偏见。苏联的文学艺术用先进的世界观和革命精神教育和鼓舞了全世界的读者；它推动了一批一批的人走向革命，教育了一批一批的人成为新生活的建设者。苏联各民族文学的发展，是旧时代所梦想不到的。有些过去连文字都没有的民族，现在已经有了自己的文学，自己的作家。还有甚么一种文学能对人类做出这样巨大的贡献呢？还有甚么一种文学能有这样广大的群众基础呢？对于这种文学，谁能抹煞它的价值呢？无可否认，苏联文学是世界无产阶级文学的伟大的开拓者，社会主义现实主义是人类艺术发展的新阶段。
    我国的文学，在共产党领导之下，从来把社会主义现实主义当作最正确的创作原则，把苏联的作品当作自己的榜样。我们学习苏联的经验，当然不应教条式地、机械地照搬，而应按照本国的具体实际，独立地、有分析地加以吸取。社会主义文学只能在自己民族的土壤上产生和发展，它必须批判地继承民族的传统，具有民族的风格。我们从来是朝着这个方向努力的。
  由于我们的文学是和最先进的阶级、最先进的思想、最先进的社会制度相联系的，它在短短的期间就有了过去任何时代所不能比拟的巨大发展。右派分子说现在作品少了，戏也少了，一切都今不如昔。是的，那种为地主贵族、为资产阶级老爷所需要的文艺不但是少了，而且会完全淘汰。至于为劳动人民所需要的文艺，却不是少了，而是从来也没有像今天这样多。这是除了闭着眼睛说瞎话的右派分子，谁都看得见的事实。我们的新文艺正在逐步深入到工厂、农村和部队。现在工农出身和实际工作干部出身的作家正在不断地涌现。从各兄弟民族中间也产生了一些优秀的作家。工农群众的业余文学创作越来越多了。农村剧团已经发展到几十万个，农民业余创作的剧本数以万计。右派分子当然看不起群众的创作，但是我们却从这个空前的普及规模上看到了我国文艺事业的未来。我们一贯重视文学艺术的普及工作，重视劳动群众的业余创作的大量发展。文艺的群众路线保证我们的文学艺术能够达到普遍的繁荣和高涨。但是，我们从来不满足于文艺事业已有的成绩，因为它离人民所希望和要求于它的还很远。无可讳言，我们今天好的作品还太少，今天的作家中还很少有人能够赶上并且超过我们的一些伟大的先辈。许多作家还缺乏对于社会和时代进行高度的艺术概括的能力。这是不足为奇的。一个时代的文学的成熟，需要经过一个相当长久的过程。
    社会主义文学还是比较年青的文学。苏联文学从高尔基1907年发表“母亲”算起，到现在不过五十年出头一点。我国新文学运动从“五四”到现在还不满四十年；严格地说，我国文学明确地自觉地走上为工农群众、为社会主义服务的道路，是在延安文艺座谈会以后开始的，到现在才有十五年多一点。这比之有两千多年历史的中国封建时代的文学和有四五百年历史的欧洲资产阶级时代的文学，时间就短得多了。怎么能拿衡量几百年、几千年中所产生的东西的尺度来要求几十年中所产生的东西呢？但是当我们的作家透彻地理解了我们所处的时代，和劳动群众真正打成了一片，并且充分地掌握了优秀的文化遗产的时候，当文学有了巩固的新的群众基础的时候，社会主义文学一定能够不但在思想上而且在艺术结晶化的程度上很快地赶上并超过过去任何时代的文学。对这一点，我们从来是充满信心；我们每天都在为这个目标创造必要的条件。
    在我国，1957年才在全国范围内举行一次最彻底的思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义大革命，给资产阶级反动思想以致命的打击，解放文学艺术界及其后备军的生产力，解除旧社会给他们带上的脚镣手铐，免除反动空气的威胁，替无产阶级文学艺术开辟了一条广泛发展的道路。在这以前，这个历史任务是没有完成的。这个开辟道路的工作今后还要做，旧基地的清除不是一年工夫可以全部完成的。但是基本的道路算是开辟了，几十路、几百路纵队的无产阶级文学艺术战士可以在这条路上纵横驰骋了。文学艺术也要建军，也要练兵。一支完全新型的无产阶级文艺大军正在建成，它跟无产阶级知识分子大军的建成只能是同时的，其生产收获也大体上只能是同时的。这个道理只有不懂历史唯物主义的人才会认为不正确。
    社会主义文学艺术必须继承过去文学艺术中的一切优良传统，我们的作家必须向先辈学习。但是我们的文学艺术既然叫做社会主义文学艺术，它就只能以共产主义世界观作为它的思想基础，因此，它必须像“共产党宣言”中所指出的那样，和“过去遗传下来的种种观念实行最彻底的决裂”。否则，就会像“宣言”中所批评的那些所谓“真正社会主义”的诗人一样，写出来的作品名曰“社会主义”的，而实际是资产阶级的。我们重视传统，但决不是像锺惦棐所说退回到过去的时代去。我们必须在新的思想基础上来继承和发展传统。我们的文学艺术应当以共产主义的思想教育人们，而不应当再向人们灌输封建主义或资本主义的思想。冯雪峰劝告“诗刊”的编者，要他们把这个刊物办成十九世纪的或二十一世纪的，而不要办成二十世纪的。这句话是什么意思呢？这就是叫我们的诗人脱离今天的实际，脱离当前人民的斗争；就是叫我们只继承十九世纪西方资产阶级文学的衣钵，宣传资产阶级个人主义思想，而不要宣传工人阶级的社会主义思想。修正主义者十分厌恶文学艺术表现社会主义思想，他们力图否定社会主义现实主义文学艺术和过去一切时代的现实主义文学艺术的原则的区别。秦兆阳就是如此，他说：“想从现实主义文学的内容特点上将新旧两个时代的文学划分出一条绝对不同的界线来，是有困难的。”（“现实主义——广阔的道路”）世界上任何事物都是不可能有“绝对的”界线的，但是模糊界限，就是模糊对事物的认识，就是否认事物的本质的区别。秦兆阳的这些话，无非是否定文学艺术的阶级性，否定社会主义文学艺术的革新意义。实质上，就是要用资产阶级的文学艺术来代替社会主义的文学艺术。
    我们应当怎样来看文艺的真实性这个问题呢？毫无疑问，文艺必须真实，不真实的文学艺术是没有价值的，是人民所不需要的。问题是：什么是真实？作家、艺术家是站在什么立场和抱着什么目的来描写真实？
    首先，应当说，社会主义文学艺术是最真实的文学艺术。因为工人阶级是最先进的阶级，它从来不害怕揭示生活的真实状况。只有剥削阶级，为了蒙蔽劳动人民的眼睛，才需要掩盖现实的真象。正是社会主义文学艺术，真实地表现了人民群众在劳动和斗争中改造世界，同时又改造自己的雄伟过程，描写了推动社会前进的阶级斗争和新旧斗争的复杂现象。这种文学艺术打动了新时代的千百万群众的心灵。世界上还有甚么文学艺术比这更真实的呢？
    大家知道，文学艺术是生活的反映，而现实生活中是存在着各种各样的矛盾的。马克思主义告诉我们：人类的主要矛盾是人与自然之间的矛盾和人与人之间的矛盾，这两种矛盾就体现为生产斗争和阶级斗争，在阶级消灭以后则体现为新旧斗争。毛泽东同志又特别指出在人与人之间的矛盾中必须严格区别两种性质不同的矛盾：一种是人民和人民的敌人之间的矛盾，一种是人民内部的矛盾。我们的文学艺术在表现人民如何同他们的压迫者、剥削者作英勇卓绝的斗争这一方面绘下了悲壮的震撼人心的画卷。但要表现人民作了自己命运的主人之后如何正确地处理他们自己之间的矛盾，如何摆脱长期旧社会遗留在他们身上的影响，如何正确地解决个人和集体的关系，如何让先进克服落后，并带动落后的人一同前进，这就在我们的作家、艺术家面前提出了前所未有的新的创作上的任务和一连串新的问题，需要社会主义现实主义的文学艺术来解决。右派分子和修正主义者就正是在这个问题上和我们纠缠。教条主义者看不见或者不愿意承认人民内部的矛盾，就必然会走到文学艺术上的无冲突论，这当然是错误的。但是右派分子和修正主义者故意模糊或掩盖人民同人民的敌人之间的矛盾，而把人民内部的矛盾，特别是被领导者和领导者之间的矛盾当作旧时代的被压迫的人民同反动统治者的矛盾来看待，把本来是人民之间的是非问题，夸大成为敌我的问题，这就是更错误，而且更危险得多了。他们认为文学艺术的主要任务就是暴露我们社会的缺点，揭发生活中的阴暗面。在他们眼中，似乎只有揭露阴暗面的作品才是“真实”的，而“歌颂光明面”的作品就都是“粉饰现实”的，“不真实的”。他们的所谓真实是那种消极的、落后的、停滞的、死亡着的东西，他们不能或者不愿意看到作为社会主义现实主流的一切生气勃勃的、强有力的、沸腾着的、前进着的东西，不能或者不愿意用革命的、发展的观点来观察社会主义的真实，否认革命的浪漫主义是社会主义现实主义的一个必不可少的方面。他们主张作家自然主义地到生活的各个角落中去搜罗缺点，寻找黑暗，然后把它们加以放大，一件一件地陈列出来，让人民看了丧气，敌人见了鼓掌，引起人们对革命、对社会主义制度的失望和怀疑。这就是他们提倡的所谓“写真实”，他们所鼓吹的甚么“大胆干预生活”的真正目的。
    提倡作家、艺术家暴露人民的“黑暗”这种理论并没有甚么新颖之处。早在十五年前王实味在延安就是这种理论的首创者，萧军、罗烽等人从而附和之，借口“太阳里面也有黑点”，假借所谓“鲁迅笔法”，鼓动作家用当年鲁迅对付敌人的那种“匕首”“投枪”式的杂文来攻击工人阶级和劳动人民。丁玲的“三八节有感”“在医院中”等作品，就是这种主张的实践。“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”给了这种反动思想以严厉的批判。不料近一两年来，在国际修正主义思潮的冲击之下，在我国提倡写黑暗的论调又甚嚣尘上，几乎成为一时的风气。刘宾雁就是在这种空气下成了名人。他们正是王实味传统的一脉相承。显然，他们并不是想要认真地来解决如何在作品中真实地表现人民内部的矛盾及正确地批评生活中的落后现象这个问题，而是借此夸大人民内部的矛盾，颠倒是非，混淆敌我，企图把文学艺术引到反人民的道路上去。
    在我们的社会中是否存在着缺点和阴暗面呢？当然是存在的。缺点和阴暗面，不但现在有，将来也永远有，否则历史就不会继续前进了。历史永远是在矛盾斗争的过程中前进的，永远是在克服缺点和阴暗面的过程中前进的，旧的缺点克服了，新的缺点又会产生。在我国的目前时期，剥削制度基本上消灭了，但是，旧思想旧习惯的影响还是顽强地存留着；人民的经济生活和文化水平还没有提到更高的程度；人民为着建设自己的新生活还须忍受和克服种种的难以想像的困难；官僚主义和各种脱离群众、违反群众利益的现象还是经常发生。我们当然不需要去掩盖这些生活中的消极的阴暗面。但是，必须看到，正是生活中的新的、积极的、先进的事物才是我们社会中的主要的决定性的东西。六亿中国人民组织起来了，有了社会主义的觉悟，有了高度的纪律精神，这就是排山倒海旋转乾坤的力量。真正爱国的爱人民的作家、艺术家，谁能不为此而感动而鼓舞呢？只有那些在精神上和没落阶级相联系的作家、艺术家才不愿看见我们生活中的这个伟大变化，不愿承认新事物的强大的生命力，对着蓬勃发展的新的现实，他们所感到的，只是黑暗和缺点。有阴暗心理的人，看一切事物都是阴暗的，对于他们，阴暗就是唯一的真实。他们害怕看到光明，社会主义的逼人的光芒，他们看了是很不舒服的。这完全是他们的阶级本能的反映。他们总是面向过去，留恋过去，把在过去地主资产阶级统治时代人们的生活和心理面貌当作一成不变的真实，他们看不见或者不愿意看见新时代人物的性格和相互关系的根本变化。文学应当深刻地挖掘人的灵魂，不应当把人的心理简单化。但是时代变了，人物的性格和关系也变了，文学怎么可以照老样子去描写呢？具有集体主义思想和高度纪律性的人们在生活中不断涌现出来了，他们是新时代的英雄。派分子和修正主义者不相信在这新时代中，人的思想深处可以没有个人主义，英雄可以临难不惧，内心没有丝毫动摇。他们不相信这一切。“人不为己，天诛地灭”，“到处乌鸦一般黑”，这就是他们的哲学。如果作品中写了新生活、新性格的真实，他们就认为是不真实的，“理想化的”。新事物分明在生活中已成为大量存在，但他们却还是视而不见，仍然一心去寻找旧事物；而当新事物还处于萌芽状态时，那就更不值他们的一盼了。我们批评作品的公式化、概念化，主要是由于这些作品对于我们时代的英雄的现实没有能够作出有力的深刻的反映。它们把生活简单化了。右派分子和修正主义者却是相反，他们不满意的正是这些作品或多或少地反映了工农群众的新生活，而他们是不喜欢这种生活的。他们说生活就是“公式化、概念化”的，群众就是“教条主义”的，这就可见他们反对的并不是甚么作品的公式化概念化的倾向，而是新生活的本身，社会主义制度的本身。刘绍棠反对社会主义现实主义，认为作家不应当从“动”的观点而应当从“静”的观点来观察和描写现实，这正是表现了他惧怕社会主义变革的资产阶级反动观点。
    我们同右派分子和修正主义者的分歧，还不只是在于他们故意地不适当地夸大我们生活中的缺点和阴暗面，而更在于他们从资产阶级个人主义的立场出发，常常把生活中正面的积极的事物当作坏现象，而把反面的消极的事物当作好东西。在他们看来，农业合作化是坏事情，应该反对，而富裕中农的资本主义自发势力是好的，值得同情；思想改造是不好的，坚持资产阶级思想是好的；个人服从集体是不好的，发展个人主义是好的；遵守纪律是不好的，自由主义是好的。在他们看来，勤勤恳恳、忠心耿耿地为党工作的人，是“衰退”的或者“庸碌”的人，而狂妄自大，目无组织的人，是有“朝气”有“才能”的。人们的立场不同，嗅觉视觉也跟着不同了。丁玲的“在医院中”和刘宾雁的“本报内部消息”，就是两个最突出的标本，作者完全站在反党反人民的立场，歪曲了我们的现实生活，而把资产阶级个人主义者当作英雄来加以歌颂。可见右派分子和修正主义者提倡暴露黑暗，只是暴露工人阶级和劳动人民的黑暗，而并不是暴露地主和资本家的黑暗。他们嘲笑和反对表现新英雄人物，原来也只是反对表现新的集体主义的英雄人物，而对于资产阶级个人主义的“英雄”，他们却永远也歌颂不完。
    我们的文学作品是应该暴露黑暗的。既然在我们的生活中有光明面也有阴暗面，文学就应当既歌颂光明又揭露黑暗，就应当描写光明和黑暗的斗争。文学不应当片面地反映生活。凡是足以阻碍社会进步的消极落后的现象，都应当加以批评和揭露。官僚主义就是这种现象之一，就应当揭露和批判。我们的文学作品应当成为和一切消极事物作斗争的武器，成为批评和自我批评的武器。我们是反对无冲突论的。问题是从什么立场和为什么目的去进行揭露和批评。我们的作家应当站在正确的立场明辨是非，真正分清什么是光明面，什么是阴暗面；不要有闻必录甚至幸灾乐祸地去渲染和夸大阴暗面，抹煞光明面，造成读者对生活的曲解和失望。我们的作品应当描写生活中的各种矛盾和困难、缺点和错误，当然也可以描写失败和牺牲，但不应当使人看了灰心丧气，而是增添克服困难的勇气和信心。我们对于现实是充满信心的，所以我们的文学永远是乐观的。我们和右派分子、修正主义者在关于写黑暗的问题上的分界线就在这里。
    无论是外国的法斯特，或是我国的冯雪峰，都把艺术的真实性和政治的正确性对立起来，似乎一个作家如果有一个正确的政治立场，就不可能在艺术上保持真实了。法斯特叛党以后就宣布他今后再“不能按照‘正确’的来写作”。他要求在政治上犯错误的权利。冯雪峰也劝告作家不要首先考虑政治上正确或错误的问题。主张修改社会主义现实主义原则的秦兆阳说得更巧妙些。他说要作家脑子里具有社会主义的精神和愿望，那“就无异于是说，客观真实并不是绝对地值得重视，更重要的是作家脑子里某种固定的抽象的‘社会主义精神’和愿望，必要时必须使血肉生动的客观真实去服从这种抽象的固定的主观上的东西；那结果，就很可能使得文学作品脱离客观真实，甚至成为某种政治概念的传声筒。”（“现实主义——广阔的道路”）。按照秦兆阳的意思，“客观真实”和作家的“社会主义精神”似乎是格格不入的，只有所谓“客观真实”才“绝对地”值得重视，甚么“社会主义精神”和愿望，顶多只是“相对地”值得重视罢了，在他看来，导致作品的概念化、公式化，妨碍作品的真实性的，不是别的东西，原来就是这个社会主义精神。他憎恶、讨厌这个社会主义精神。要没有这个“固定的、抽象的主观上的东西”，该多好呵！那时作家就可以讲自己“心里想说的话”，就可以写“自己感到最激动的题材”了！当然，作家应当而且只能写“自己感到最激动的题材”。但使你最激动的是什么呢？为甚么群众中大量新的社会主义的事物引不起你丝毫的兴趣，而一个个人主义的知识分子在革命集体中的遭遇却使你兴奋得终夜失眠呢？作家应当真诚坦率，把自己的思想用最明确最不含糊的形式表达出来。一个真正站在人民立场的作家是决不隐蔽自己的观点的。但在右派分子和修正主义者看来，一个作家如果讲拥护共产党、拥护人民、拥护社会主义的话，那就不是讲的“真心话”，反之，如果讲反对共产党、反对人民、反对社会主义的话，那倒是“真心话”了。他们自己又不敢直捷了当地讲出这种“真心话”来，因此讲话就只好含糊其词，一举一动，总是“左顾右盼，心神不安”了，这真是那些怀有鬼胎的人们的真实心理的写照。
    我们应当怎样来看创作自由的问题呢？在我国，文艺和科学事业是享有充分自由的。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，就是这种自由的重要保证。我们的国家为文艺及其他各种书籍的出版提供了最优越的条件。根据宪法，国家只对反共、反人民、反社会主义的作品加以限制或禁止，因为这是人民的根本利益所不容许的。而右派分子所盼望的，却正是出版这类作品的自由。
    我们要求文学是社会主义的文学，而不是资产阶级的文学，要求文学为广大劳动人民服务，而不是为少数“上等人”服务。对于资产阶级的作家、对于右派分子和修正主义者来说，这的确是限制了他们的自由。他们不能自由地鼓吹资产阶级反动思想，不能自由地写反党、反人民、反社会主义的作品了，因为这样的作品会受到群众的指责和反对。但是，对于工人阶级的作家，对于愿意为劳动人民服务的作家来说，这不是限制他们的自由，而恰恰是扩大他们的自由。正是社会主义思想，正是为社会主义服务、为劳动人民服务的崇高目的，使我们的作家能够摆脱资产阶级个人主义世界观的束缚，和劳动人民建立密切的联系，从劳动人民的生活和斗争中取得无限丰富的创作源泉。这是创作上的真正的自由。作家感到不自由，正是由于受到那种资产阶级个人主义思想的束缚，正是由于他不熟悉劳动人民的生活，他只能表现自己或自己周围的少数人，因而他的自由是很小的。作家只有和时代和人民相结合，才能有真正的广大的自由。
    右派分子和修正主义者认为文艺要为政治服务、为社会主义服务就不自由。冯雪峰曾经责备我们不尊重作家“创作的权利和自由”，对作家实行了“思想上的管制”，说我们要求作家为当前的革命任务而写作，是制造“奉命文学”。他忘记了伟大的鲁迅就是把自己的作品称为“遵命文学”，他是以遵先驱者之命而创作作为自己的光荣的。当然，我们不应当把为政治服务狭隘地解释为要求作家去宣传党和国家当前的每个具体的、个别的和只有暂时的局部的意义的政策，更不应当要求作家按照政策的条文写作。如果那样要求，是会有害于创作的，是错误的，因为那样“创作”出来的作品没有人爱看，人们将说，我们与其看这种作品，还不如看报纸的社论了。人民所要求于文学的，显然是另外一种性质的东西。人民要求从文学中看到社会主义生活的广阔和丰富的画面，从那里面学会怎样认识和对待新的生活，而不是去寻求例如怎样调整物价、怎样预防传染病之类的答案。但是，右派分子和修正主义者所要求的“创作自由”，实际上却是要文艺脱离社会主义，脱离当前人民的斗争，摆脱党的领导。他们一心要实行资产阶级的文艺路线，党的领导当然会使他们感到“不自由”。因此他们总是用种种的口实和理由来攻击党对文艺事业的领导。
    有些作家感到不自由，是因为他们的作品发表出来以后，常常会受到这样那样的批评，文字的和口头的，群众中来的和领导上来的，使他们感到有一股很大的精神的压力。压力总是不好受的。但我们也要加以分析。不讲道理的、粗暴的批评，对创作是有害的。这种压力应当反对。另一种是正确而恰当的批评，包括领导和群众的意见，某些作家认为这也是压力。但这种“压力”，我们是不应当反对的。作品是通过艺术形式对于社会存在的反映，同时又给予社会以影响。它不能不受到社会舆论的评判。而无论是赞扬或者指摘都难免有不正确的地方。我们需要健全的社会舆论，同时作家也要有不怕批评的勇气。对人民具有高度责任感的作家艺术家应当重视别人的意见，欢迎批评。毛泽东同志在1957年3月间召开的全国宣传会议上说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的。”我们大家都应当努力做这样的唯物主义者。
    至于在作品的取材上，在表现手法和艺术风格上，作家应当有完全的自由。我们提倡写工农兵，决不是排斥作家按照不同的经验、特长和兴趣写各种其他的题材。我们认为社会主义现实主义是最好的创作方法，但这只能向作家提倡，鼓励作家提高马克思列宁主义的思想修养，密切和劳动人民的联系，使社会主义思想真正成为作家的血肉和灵魂，而不是向作家下一道强制执行的命令。社会主义现实主义是只能从每个作家具体创作实践的结果中体现出来的，而不能主观地强求。在艺术风格上，我们鼓励多样性和个人独创性。
    以上所述，就是我们同右派分子和修正主义者在文艺思想上的主要分歧。可以看出，这个分歧最突出、最集中地表现在对文艺和政治的关系的看法上。修正主义者力图使文艺脱离革命的政治。教条主义者简单地认为只要有政治，就有艺术。他们忽视艺术创作的特点和技巧的重要。他们的公式是政治即艺术，实际就是取消艺术，这当然是错误的。修正主义者的公式则是艺术即政治，这是使政治服从艺术，实际就是使革命的政治服从于掩盖在艺术外衣之下的反革命的政治。教条主义者认为马克思主义不但可以包括而且可以代替创作方法，他们以全体代替部分，有导致作家离开现实主义道路的危险。修正主义者则相反地认为创作方法可以包括甚至代替马克思主义，他们是以部分代替全体，其目的就是诱导作家离开正确的政治方向。正确的公式，应当是像毛泽东同志所说的，“马克思主义只能包括而不能代替文艺创作中的现实主义”。教条主义者虽然和修正主义者站在完全相反的立场，但他们看问题的方法都是形而上学的，片面的；他们总是把政治和艺术看成对立的或者等同的。马克思主义者把政治和艺术看成对立的统一；把“政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”作为创作的奋斗目标；以政治标准和艺术标准的统一而以政治标准为第一来衡量一切作品，这才是正确的。
    我国文艺上的无产阶级路线和资产阶级路线的斗争是由来已久的。这是文艺上两条路线的斗争。无产阶级的文艺路线曾经经历了它的幼稚的阶段，犯过教条主义、宗派主义及其它各种错误，到1942年毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表后，才奠定了坚固的理论基础，并且在实践中完全证明了这条路线的正确。教条主义的错误，需要继续加以克服。但目前更危险的是修正主义。修正主义是资产阶级思潮在工人阶级内部的反映，它的特点是打着马克思主义的招牌，在反对“教条主义”“宗派主义”的口实下来反对马克思主义，反对党的领导。修正主义文艺路线的主要内容就是否定文艺为劳动人民服务，为革命的政治服务的崇高使命，否定在阶级社会中文艺的阶级性，否定或歪曲民族的文化传统，否定作家的思想改造，否定党对文艺事业的领导作用。二十多年来，我们和胡风、王实味争的是这个问题，和冯雪峰争的也是这个问题。冯雪峰和胡风的思想是一脉相通，代表一条修正主义的资产阶级路线。（他们自己吹嘘代表什么现实主义正统，实际上他们代表的正是反现实主义的路线。）修正主义路线如果得了势，就会把我们的文艺事业引到资产阶级的方向上去，就会使文艺队伍陷于分裂。所以，我们必须在继续克服教条主义的同时，将重点放在反对修正主义上。只有这样，我们的社会主义文艺事业才能前进，队伍才能团结。我们揭露了丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰等人的反党活动，就是排除了文艺队伍的宗派分裂的危险因素，保障了我们的文艺队伍在社会主义的旗帜下紧密地团结前进。
    文艺界的反右派斗争取得了胜利，为社会主义文艺事业的顺利发展扫清了道路。我们必须巩固这个斗争的胜利。现在全国人民正处在生产建设的高潮中。我们要争取在文学艺术事业上也来一个大跃进。我国人民正以排山倒海的气势从事改造世界、改变历史面貌的伟大工作，他们的高度劳动热情和革命干劲在一切方面不可遏止地表现出来，也必然要在文学艺术这种特殊的意识形态上得到它应有的反映。劳动人民在创造物质财富的同时也在不断地创造精神财富。工农群众对文化的迫切要求是前所未有的，他们的各种业余文化艺术活动正在大量地、蓬勃地开展。我们的文艺如果要达到一个新的跃进，就必须在更大规模和更深程度上和工农群众相结合，文艺作品要在量和质两方面都能满足群众的要求。
    毛泽东同志早就号召作家“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。现在全国成千成万的领导干部和知识分子下乡上山，参加体力劳动和基层工作。文艺工作者也正在大批地下乡、下厂，建立自己生活的根据地，准备长期和劳动人民生活在一起。作家在劳动中，斗争中和工农群众长期结合，已成为我们文艺工作的根本原则。
    文艺工作者和工农群众相结合，就是很好地体现脑力劳动和体力劳动、个人才能和群众智慧的结合。我们的社会十分尊重作家艺术家的个人才能，因为只有高度发挥个人独创性，才能使我们的文学艺术丰富多彩。但同时我们始终认为个人才能是群众智慧的集中，个人才能如果脱离了群众智慧的基础，那就像无根之木、无源之水一样，决不可能有什么了不起的发展前途。只有真正与工农群众结合，作家、艺术家的才能才会永不枯竭。
    工人阶级的文艺工作者应该顽强地学习。人民不需要空头的文学家、艺术家。我们既要“红”，又要“专”，既要掌握马克思主义的世界观，又要掌握高度的创作技巧。只有当我们的作家、艺术家在政治上、思想上和技巧上都达到成熟的程度，我们才能够有一支真正强大的工人阶级的文艺队伍。为了达到这个目的，除了学习，别无捷径。我们要向马克思列宁主义学习，向人民群众学习，向中国和世界的一切有益的伟大遗产和传统学习。我们不只要在书本上学习，而主要地是在斗争中，实践中，在互相竞赛和辩论中学习。我们的作家、艺术家应当在创作上和理论上都有高度的勇气，敢于打破成规，大胆创造，敢于革新，敢于幻想，敢于批评。我们要把创造无愧于这个伟大时代的作品当作无可推卸的责任，我们一定要出色地完成这个任务。
