Xinhua News Agency, February 1st. The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China opened this afternoon at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai, Beijing.

Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, and Bo Yibo, and Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng attended the opening ceremony of the meeting.

When Chairman Mao Zedong and other state leaders entered the venue and ascended the rostrum, the delegates applauded warmly for a long time.

The opening ceremony of the meeting was presided over by Chairman Liu Shaoqi. After he announced the opening of the meeting, the band played the national anthem.

All the delegates unanimously approved the agenda of this meeting. The main agenda of the meeting is:

    Review and approve the 1958 national budget;
    Decide on the 1958 national economic plan;
    Approve the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme;
    Adopt the report on the examination of the qualifications of deputies;
    Adopt the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Before approving the agenda, all the delegates elected the presidium and secretary-general of the congress, totaling eighty-nine people.

The meeting then heard a report by Ma Mingfang, Chairman of the Credentials Committee, on the examination of the qualifications of newly elected deputies and the qualifications of rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi and thirty-eight others. All the delegates unanimously approved the report of the Credentials Committee, believing that the thirty-eight rightist elements such as Zhang Naiqi had lost the legal basis for continuing to perform the duties of deputies to the National People's Congress and should not attend this meeting.

Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian delivered a report at today's meeting on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget. The report is divided into four parts: 1. The implementation of the 1957 national budget; 2. The arrangements for the 1958 national budget; 3. The improvement of the 1958 fiscal system; 4. Oppose conservatism, oppose waste, and use a large-scale production increase and economy movement to guarantee the realization of the 1958 national budget.

Li Xiannian said that the implementation of the 1957 national budget was good, and the over-fulfillment of the national fiscal revenue and expenditure plan not only guaranteed the completion of the construction plan for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, but also powerfully proved the strong vitality of the socialist system. He said that the implementation of the 1957 national budget proved that in all financial and economic work, we must fully recognize the great role of human factors and political factors, and we must fully recognize the great role of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people under the new socialist relations of production. Fully recognizing these roles will enable us to maintain full confidence, determination and revolutionary vigor in the face of any difficulties.

Li Xiannian said that the 1958 national budget is a budget that opposes conservative tendencies, actively taps potential, and has relatively rapid growth in income and expenditure. It is a budget that implements the spirit of rectification, resolutely opposes waste, and resolutely tightens non-productive expenditures. It is a budget that actively increases productive expenditures, actively develops basic construction, and vigorously supports agriculture.

Li Xiannian pointed out: The current international situation is very favorable for our people to build socialism. The East Wind has significantly prevailed over the West Wind. The strength of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger, the strength of the international proletariat is growing stronger, and the forces advocating international peace are growing stronger, while the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is increasingly falling into chaos and passivity. It is clear that the sooner we build socialism, the more we will contribute to world peace.

Li Xiannian said with full confidence that, taking into account all favorable situations, the 1958 national budget is not only possible to complete according to plan, but also possible to over fulfill as long as we actively work hard.

Li Xiannian emphasized the great significance of building the country through diligence and thrift in his report. He said that thrift is not only the task of all state workers and economic workers, but also the common task of all the people. Advocating thrift and opposing waste is not only about accumulating construction funds, but also about changing customs and habits, and cultivating the good living habits and moral qualities of the people across the country.

Li Xiannian finally requested the people of the whole country to continue to rouse their revolutionary spirit, oppose conservative ideas, oppose waste, and further launch a large-scale production increase and economy movement to welcome the production and construction upsurge in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Li Xiannian's report lasted two hours and was constantly met with enthusiastic applause from the delegates.

After Li Xiannian's report, Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, delivered the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The meeting approved the chairman and members of the Proposals Examination Committee of the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, totaling thirty-seven people.

Finally, Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee, read out the suggestions submitted to the Congress by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The meeting agreed with the suggestions of the Standing Committee and unanimously passed the resolution of the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on removing the duties of rightist elements Huang Shaohong and other ten people from the Nationalities Committee, the Legislative Committee, and the National Defense Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Today's meeting began at 3:00 p.m. and ended at 5:50 p.m.

As of today, one thousand and fifteen delegates have reported to the meeting, and nine hundred and seventy-five delegates attended today's meeting. Heads of various government departments attended today's meeting as observers. Diplomatic envoys of various countries to China and some foreign guests visiting Beijing attended today's meeting as guests.

　　一致通过停止章乃器等右派分子出席会议，罢免黄绍竑等在各委员会中的职务
    新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议，今天下午在北京中南海怀仁堂开幕。
    毛泽东主席，朱德副主席，刘少奇委员长，周恩来总理，林伯渠、李济深、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通副委员长，彭德怀、贺龙、陈毅、李先念、聂荣臻、薄一波副总理，张鼎丞检察长，出席了会议的开幕式。
    毛泽东主席等国家领导人员步入会场登上主席台的时候，代表们长久地热烈鼓掌。
    会议的开幕式是刘少奇委员长主持的。在他宣布会议开幕以后，乐队奏起了国歌。
    全体代表一致通过了这次会议的议程。会议的主要议程是：
    审查和批准1958年国家预算；
    决定1958年度国民经济计划；
    批准汉语拼音方案；
    通过代表资格的审查报告；
    通过全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    在通过议程以前，全体代表选出了大会的主席团和秘书长，共八十九人。
    会议接着由代表资格审查委员会主任委员马明方作了中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会代表资格审查委员会关于补选的代表资格和右派分子章乃器等三十八人的代表资格问题的审查报告。全体代表一致通过了代表资格审查委员会的报告，认为章乃器等三十八个右派分子已经丧失了继续执行全国人民代表大会代表职务的合法根据，不应出席这次会议。
    国务院副总理兼财政部长李先念在今天的大会上作了关于1957年国家预算执行情况和1958年国家预算草案的报告。报告共分四个部分：一、1957年国家预算执行情况；二、1958年国家预算的安排；三、1958年财政制度的改进；四、反保守，反浪费，用大规模的增产节约运动来保证实现1958年的国家预算。
    李先念说，1957年国家预算执行情况是良好的，国家财政收支计划的超额完成，不但保证了第一个五年计划最后一年建设计划的完成，而且有力地证明了社会主义制度的强大生命力。他说，1957年国家预算执行情况证明，在一切财政经济工作中，必须充分地认识到人的因素、政治的因素的伟大作用，必须充分地认识劳动人民在新的社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性的伟大作用。充分地认识到这些作用，就会使我们在任何困难面前都能保持充分的信心、坚定性和革命的干劲。
    李先念说，1958年的国家预算，是一个反对保守倾向、积极挖掘潜力、收入和支出增长比较快的预算，是一个贯彻整风精神、坚决反对浪费和坚决紧缩非生产性支出的预算，是一个积极增加生产性支出、积极发展基本建设和大力支援农业的预算。
    李先念指出：目前国际形势对于我国人民建设社会主义是十分有利的。东风显著地压倒了西风。以苏联为首的社会主义国家的力量日趋壮大，国际无产阶级的力量日趋壮大，主张国际和平的力量日趋壮大，而以美国为首的帝国主义集团则日益陷于混乱和被动。很明显，我们建成社会主义越早，我们对于世界和平也就贡献得越多。
    李先念充满信心地说，估计到一切有利的形势，1958年的国家预算不仅有可能按计划完成，而且只要我们积极努力，还有可能超额完成。
    李先念在报告中着重强调了勤俭建国的重大意义。他说，节约不仅是全体国家工作人员和经济工作人员的任务，而且是全体人民的共同任务。提倡节约、反对浪费的意义，不但在于积累建设资金，而且在于移风易俗，养成全国人民的优良的生活习惯和道德品质。
    李先念最后要求全国人民继续鼓起革命干劲，反对保守思想，反对浪费现象，进一步展开大规模的增产节约运动，来迎接第二个五年计划第一年的生产建设高潮。
    李先念的报告历两小时，不断得到代表们的热烈鼓掌。
    李先念报告以后，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长兼秘书长彭真作了全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    会议通过了中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议提案审查委员会的主任委员和委员，共三十七人。
    最后，常务委员会副委员长兼秘书长彭真宣读了全国人民代表大会常务委员会向大会提出的建议。会议同意常务委员会的建议，全体通过了中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议关于罢免全国人民代表大会常务委员会民族委员会法案委员会和国防委员会中的右派分子黄绍竑等十人的职务的决议。
    今天的会议在下午三时开始，五时五十分结束。
