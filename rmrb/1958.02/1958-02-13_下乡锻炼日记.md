Down to the Countryside Training Diary
New Commune Member of Lüjia Village Agricultural Cooperative, Nanpi County, Hebei Province: Zhang Zhengchang

December 26, 1957, Thursday, Sunny
　　
Today I officially started working in the fields.

The team leader told me to pull a cart with Uncle Lü Yürong to haul soil. The work is relatively light, but it's not that easy when you first start. When I was shoveling soil onto the cart, I used all my strength with both hands, and after shoveling less than ten times, I was covered in sweat. I glanced at Uncle Lü Yürong, who was still shoveling soil onto the cart, one shovel after another, very calmly. He probably noticed my awkward situation and straightened up to say, "Don't rush, take it one shovel at a time!" Before I could answer, he said, "Like this..." Then he demonstrated the correct posture: resting the shovel handle on his knee, he pressed down slightly, and the shovel was full of soil. Then, with a thrust of his leg, the shovel sprang up like a spring, and he casually dumped the soil into the cart. I tried it myself, and it was indeed much easier. Who says farm work doesn't require brains?

Today, we hauled a total of twelve carts of soil, and Uncle said that was two more carts than usual. Labor is the most honest thing; the more you put in, the more you get out, and there's no room for falsehood.

January 1, Wednesday, Cloudy

As soon as the sun peeked out, the team leader called everyone to bring a "dry meal" (i.e., corn cakes) to Liu Xiucai (village name) to chop down trees.

Liu Xiucai is about two or three li away from where we live. More than thirty people, each carrying an iron shovel and an axe, walked on the ridges of the fields, like soldiers going to war. I walked in the middle, with several old men in front and several young men behind. The old men asked me if I was tired, and the young men asked about the situation in Beijing. I was overwhelmed.

As soon as we arrived, a strong wind began to blow. The wind was stronger than usual here. I chopped for a while, and my hands were very sore. Once, when I raised my axe to chop down, a gust of wind blew, and I staggered several steps. At that moment, I thought of Paul and others repairing the railway, so I cheered up again.

"If you're tired, take a break," Uncle Yu Huai said to me with a smile.

Uncle Yu Huai is forty-nine years old this year. His wife died early, and he has three children. The family of four depends entirely on him. After work, he also has to cook, which is very tiring. I teamed up with him for two days to pull a cart, and he never looked at the time when he worked, only stopping when it was dark. When driving the cart, he always hummed Hebei Bangzi opera. From him, I saw the working people's attitude towards life.

Lunch was eaten at the work site. We held salted vegetables in one hand and a cake in the other, stuffing them into our mouths. I don't know if it was because we were hungry or because of the fun of eating outdoors, but it tasted better and better.

When we went home, it was already dark. On the way, I sneezed several times. An old man walking behind me said with concern, "Did you catch a cold? It doesn't matter, you won't catch a cold after a few more times!" His short words pricked my heart like needles. I grew up in a greenhouse, unable to withstand a little wind and rain. If I don't go out into the storms and waves to toughen myself, how can I become strong?

January 3, Friday, Cloudy

The wind blew all day.

Today we hauled manure, and the process was the same as hauling soil. But heaven was not on our side, and when we shoveled manure, the manure chips often flew into our faces. To be honest, I couldn't help but feel a little "tight" inside; but I thought that farm work is inseparable from manure, so I continued to work as usual. People's thoughts and feelings may be changing from these things.

The old man who was hauling manure with me was named Lü Zhenyou, a poor peasant and a Communist Party member. His family had worked for landlords for generations, without a house or a piece of land. It was only after the land reform that he turned over. After collectivization, his life got better and better, but his annual income was only sixty or seventy yuan. I asked him, "Are you living well?" He smiled and, after a long pause, slowly said, "Life is not satisfactory, but it's like heaven and earth compared to the past. When things are good, think about the past; when things are bad, think about the future, and all problems will be solved!"

The working people are great! They have created humanity's material and spiritual wealth, but they don't covet enjoyment. We "intellectuals" understand the principles, but we often argue endlessly for personal fame and status, dissatisfied with this and that. Compared to them, I feel extremely ashamed.

January 5, Sunday, Cloudy

When I returned from the fields, the landlady had been waiting at the door for a long time. She patted the dirt off my shoulders and said, "Come in and rest, and eat!" She had been doing this almost every day for the past few days.

On the kang (heated brick bed), there was a small table. On it were a plate of salted vegetables and several corn cakes. The so-called corn cakes are made from millet, corn, and soybeans mixed together. When I first ate them, because they were new, I found them a bit fragrant; after two days, they were a little hard to swallow. But as long as you experience the hardship of labor, the fragrance is eternal.

The old man and woman are very frugal. When eating, if they dropped rice grains or crumbs, they would immediately pick them up and eat them. I also did the same, but at first, I wasn't as determined as they were. Sometimes, when I picked up the rice grains that had fallen on the kang and put them in my mouth, I couldn't help but feel a little "cold" inside when I saw the dust on them. Now, I am very careful. When eating, I often use a bowl or my hand to catch the food, trying not to let it fall on the kang; if it does fall, I pick it up, blow on it, and put it in my mouth. When I was in the office, the food was so good, but I often complained about the taste and tore up a food coupon to buy more. Thinking of these things, I feel extremely ashamed!

January 6, Monday, Sunny

At the entrance of the cooperative office, I ran into a middle-aged farmer. He asked me: What should I do if there is not enough grain to eat? I asked about his family's situation, and after carefully calculating, it was indeed about the same. I wanted to ask more questions, but he said he had to go to the market and left.

These days, several people have been "complaining" to us, saying that they don't have enough grain to eat. After we learned about it, most of them were middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. This is a noteworthy problem. On the grain front, the struggle between the two roads still exists, and it is very sharp!

I have not been here for long, and I don't know much about the situation. In the future, I must look more, listen more, and express my attitude less. But on principled issues such as grain, I must do some publicity and explanation work. What should be criticized must be criticized. In short, be vigilant and don't be deceived by appearances!

January 7, Tuesday, Sunny

The Spring Festival is approaching. The township notified us that we must complete the task of digging a 600-meter-long river within three days. Specifications: bottom width 2 meters, height 1 meter. Calculating, that's about 21,000 cubic meters of soil. The task is both urgent and arduous. Most of the male commune members have gone, and we also participated in this work.

Digging a river is heavy work. From 9:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the afternoon, there is no break in between except for lunch. The weather is cold and the ground is frozen, and the soil is very hard. It takes a lot of effort to insert the iron shovel. Although I have been training for more than ten days, I still feel very strenuous. In the afternoon, I felt even more strenuous. When I raised a shovel of soil and dumped it outside the two-meter-high riverbed, my arms were shaking, and my head was sweating profusely. All day long, my clothes were soaked with sweat, dried, and then wet again, and I don't know how many times.

Night falls again. Looking at the flat land, a river ditch has appeared. I can't help but feel infinite joy, and the fatigue disappears...

Time, what new things it brings to people! And now, I am being tested by time. But I want to say: I can withstand it, I definitely can! (Attached picture)

    下乡锻炼日记
    河北省南皮县吕家村农业社新社员　张正常
    1957年12月26日　星期四　晴
    今天正式下地干活了。
    队长告诉我跟吕毓荣大爷一块套车拉土。活是比较轻便的，但乍一干，也不那么容易。我在锨土往车上装时，只用双手使劲，锨了不到十下，便累得满头大汗。我侧头看了看吕毓荣大爷，他还在一锨锨地往车上装，态度很从容。我的尴尬情况，他大概是发现了，便直起腰来说：“别慌，一下下地来！”我还没来得及答话，他又说：“这样来……”。接着，他就做了个示范姿势：把锨把靠在膝上，稍用力一按，就锨满了土。然后，腿一挺，锨就像弹簧似地起来了，随手又把土倒进了车内。我照着试了试，果然很省劲。谁说庄稼活不用脑子呢？
    今天，共拉了十二车土，大爷说比平常日子多拉两车。劳动，是最实在的，付出了多大代价，就有多大收获，来不得半点虚假。
    1月1日　星期三　阴
    太阳刚露头，队长就招呼大伙带一顿“干的”（即玉米饼），到刘秀才（村名）去伐树。
    刘秀才离我们住的地方约二、三里地。三十多人，各扛着铁锨，拿着斧子走在田埂上，像出征的战士一样。我走在中间，前面是几位老大爷，后面是几个小伙子。大爷问我累不累，小伙子问北京的情况，简直应接不暇。
    刚到，就刮起大风来。风之大，本地少有。我砍了一阵，手酸得很。一次，当举起斧头砍下时，一股大风吹来，我踉跄了好几步。这时，我联想起保尔等抢修铁路的情景，于是，我又振作起来。
    “累，就歇歇。”玉怀大爷笑眯眯地对我说。
    玉怀大爷今年四十九岁了，妻早故，膝下尚有三个小孩。一家四口人的生活，全靠他一人撑持。放了工，他还得煮饭，够劳累的。我和他也同套过两天车，他干活是不看时间的，天黑才罢。赶车时，他总是哼着河北梆子。我从他身上，看到了劳动人民对待生活的态度。
    午饭是在工地吃的。我们一手拿咸菜，一手拿饼，大口大口地往嘴里塞。不知是饿，还是野餐的乐趣，越吃越香。
    回家时，天已黑下来。路上，我连打了几个喷嚏。走在我后面的一位大爷关切地说：“伤风了？不要紧，多经过几回就不会伤风的！”简短的话语，像针一样扎在我心间。我是在温室里长大的，见不得一点风雨，要不走到风浪里锻炼一下，怎么能坚强起来。
    1月3日　星期五　阴
    刮了一天的风。
    今天拉粪，工序和拉土一样。天不助美，锨粪时，粪屑常常飘到脸上。说实在的，心里何尝不“紧一下”；但一想，庄稼活，就离不开粪土，便又照样地干起来。人的思想感情，也许正从这些问题上开始起变化的。
    和我一块拉粪的是一位老大爷，叫吕振友，贫农，共产党员。他家几代人都给地主干活，从没有一间房，一块地。土改后，才翻了身。合作化后，他的日子越来越好，但是，一年的收入也不过六、七十元。我问他：“生活得不错吧？”他笑了笑，半晌，才慢吞吞地说：“生活嘛，还不满意，但比从前可就是天上地下了。过好日子的时候，想想过去；过苦日子的时候，想想将来，什么问题都解决了！”
    劳动人民是伟大的！他们创造了人类的物质财富和精神财富，但并不贪图享受。我们“读书人”，说来是明白道理的，但为个人的名誉、地位，常常计较不休，这不满，那不满，相形之下，惭愧极了。
    1月5日　星期日　阴
    从地里回来，房东大娘在门口已等久了。她拍着我肩上的土，说：“快进屋歇歇，吃饭！”几天来，她几乎都是这样的。
    炕上，放着一张小桌子。上面摆着一碟咸菜，几个玉米饼。所谓玉米饼，是用谷子、玉米和黄豆掺合着做的。刚一吃，由于新鲜，还觉得有点香味；隔了两天，就有点咽不下了。但只要尝试到劳动的辛苦，香味却是永远的。
    大爷和大娘很会过日子。吃饭时，要是掉了饭粒或馍花，他们马上就拣起来吃了。我也照着他们那样去做，不过刚开始没有他们那么坚决。有时，我拣起掉在炕上的饭粒，往嘴里送时，一看到上面沾着的尘土，心里就不免“冷一下”。现在，我已经很注意了。吃饭时，常常用碗或手接着，尽量不让它掉在炕上；要是掉了，拣起来，吹一下，就送到嘴里。在机关的时候，那么好的饭菜，还常嫌味道不好，撕一张饭票再去买。想起这些，不禁羞愧之至！
    1月6日　星期一　晴
    在合作社办公室的门口，碰到了一个中年农民。他问我：粮食不够吃怎么办？我问了问他家里的情况，替他细算了一下账，也差不多。我还想再问下去，他说要赶集，便走了。
    这些天，好几个人向我们“诉苦”，说粮食不够吃。经我们了解，他们多是中农和富裕中农。这是一个值得注意的问题。在粮食战线上，两条道路的斗争还存在着，而且很尖锐！
    来此时间不久，情况了解得还不多。往后要多看，多听，少表示态度。但对粮食这一类原则问题，无论如何得做些宣传解释工作。该批判的，还得予以批判。总之，要警惕，不要为现象所迷惑！
    1月7日　星期二　晴
    春节即届。乡里通知，三天之内，要完成六百公尺长的挖河任务。规格：底宽二公尺，高一公尺。计算一下，约两万一千方土。任务既紧急又艰巨。男社员大部分都去了，我们也参加了这一工作。
    挖河，是较重的活。从早上九时到下午六时，除吃午饭外，中间没有休息时间。天冷地冻，土很硬，使很大的劲，才能把铁锨插下去。虽说已经过十多天的锻炼，仍感到很吃力。下午时，更觉得吃力了。当举起一锨土，往两公尺高的河床外面倒时，两臂不住地打抖，头上也直冒大汗。一天来，汗水浸透了衣服，干了又湿，湿了又干，也不知道有多少次。
    夜幕又降临大地。看看一马平川的土地上，出现了一条河沟，不禁又觉得无限快慰，疲劳消失了……。
    时间，留给人多少新的东西啊！而现在，我正在经受着时间的考验。但是，我要说：我能经受得住，一定的！（附图片）
