Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, February 13th: How can we break through backwardness, shatter conventions, and promote a Great Leap Forward in commercial work? The basic experience of the Tianjin Department Store in Beijing is: on the basis of the rectification movement, through specific political and ideological work, boldly mobilize the masses to find and solve key problems in business operations.

As previously reported, in its proposal to all commercial workers in the city, based on its own specific situation, this store put forward the following four goals: 1. Overcome the phenomenon of overstaffing and underwork, reduce 45% of the staff, and transfer them to support agricultural production; 2. Break through the eight-hour work system that is unsuitable for commerce, and change the "two-shift system" to "one shift a day until the end"; 3. Absorb the traditional commercial methods of "frequent replenishment, quick sales, sales-based purchasing, and level-by-level responsibility," saving 37% of capital and accelerating the capital turnover rate from 6.37 times last year to 11 times; 4. In accordance with the formulated service pledge, improve service quality, with store leaders participating in sales for half a day, and each salesperson becoming an all-round salesperson familiar with all the store's goods within the year. These four creative proposals, full of socialist spirit, not only provide an example for socialist commercial workers but also open the door to a leap forward in China's commercial work.

**Boldly Mobilizing the Masses Leads to Great Improvements in Business Management**

Before the rectification movement, like many stores across the country, the main problems in this store's work were: overstaffing; poor service attitude; and poor business management. Ultimately, the root cause was the weakness of political and ideological work, and the lack of full development of socialist righteousness among the staff. During the rectification movement, through extensive airing of views and debates, these problems were clearly exposed. In the rectification, the store, in accordance with the spirit of "picking up sesame seeds first, then carrying watermelons," first concentrated its efforts on solving a batch of problems that could and should be solved immediately, thereby increasing the socialist enthusiasm of the staff. Subsequently, it further focused on one of the issues with the most staff complaints—streamlining half of the management cadres—and began to address major issues related to improving store operations.

Zhang Heng, the manager and Party branch secretary of the Chongwen District Department Store, which directly supervised this store, was a demobilized revolutionary soldier. He was not "expert" in commercial work, but he believed in the majority of the masses. From the thousands of complex problems revealed by the masses, he saw a force to rely on: the old shop assistants who had been exploited and oppressed in the old society but had accumulated a wealth of experience in business operations. Although these old shop assistants' criticisms of the leadership during the extensive airing of views were sharp, they were all constructive suggestions on how to improve work and improve leadership style. They were also very indignant at the reactionary remarks of the rightists from the very beginning. This situation inspired the Party organization and Zhang Heng to first focus on working with the old shop assistants. The old shop assistants told Zhang Heng that the traditional method of running a retail business was to replenish frequently and in small quantities, selling as much as you replenished, quickly selling and frequently replenishing, and delegating the power of purchasing to the sales staff. This would save expenses, save warehouse space, and reduce defective products, and it would also allow for purchasing based on sales volume. But what was the situation in the store now? Those who purchased goods did not care about sales, and those who sold goods did not know the inventory; winter goods were purchased in May, and it took two sets of funds to handle one set of affairs, and the inventory was countless. And the existing more than 6,000 kinds of goods could not be managed well by a few leaders. The old shop assistants suggested that the leadership delegate the power of purchasing to the sales teams to facilitate purchasing based on sales volume, reduce unreasonable commodity backlogs, and accelerate capital turnover. The old shop assistants also made sharp criticisms and specific suggestions on the eight-hour work system and the service attitude of the sales staff. This conversation opened Zhang Heng's mind. After analysis and research by the Party branch, the opinions of the old shop assistants were affirmed, and specific work steps were proposed. It was decided to use the old shop assistants as the core force to mobilize all the staff of the store to discuss the three major issues in business management—reducing capital, improving service attitude, and reducing staff—one after another, and to take action while discussing.

The work of compressing inventory and accelerating capital turnover began in October of last year. After analysis and research by the broad masses of employees, on the premise of increasing variety and meeting customer needs, and based on the characteristics of retail business, the inventory has been reduced from 314,000 yuan before October of last year to the current 190,000 yuan. According to the suggestions of the staff, in addition to using methods such as exchanging goods with other stores, consignment sales, and street stall sales to deal with the overstocked commodities worth 120,000 yuan, three main methods were adopted: 1. Change the practice of purchasing in large quantities at one time to purchasing based on sales, and determine the quantity and speed of replenishment according to the flow pattern of the goods. For example, Baozhu brand socks used to be purchased 100 dozen at a time, enough to sell for four months, but now they are purchased 5 dozen at a time, which can be turned over once every six days. 2. According to the change of seasons, gradually reduce the goods that are out of season and gradually increase the goods needed for the next season, changing the past practice of purchasing goods after the season has passed and storing up "seasonal goods" half a year in advance. 3. Delegate the power of purchasing and inventory to the members of the sales team for direct control. What goods to purchase and how much to purchase are discussed by the team members, decided by the team leader, and reviewed by the leadership. After this reform, there have been great changes in the operation. The sales staff have become the masters of the goods they sell, their sense of responsibility has been strengthened, the variety has increased, but the unreasonable inventory has been basically eliminated, and therefore the capital turnover has been greatly accelerated. Now each sales team leader knows the inventory of various commodities they sell, and some team leaders have begun to grasp the law of purchasing and selling various commodities. Due to the reduction of unreasonable inventory, general commodities can also be directly entered into the sales area without having to enter the warehouse. Some commodities that need to be stored in large quantities must be stored in the warehouse, and each sales team is responsible for the storage, so the four warehouse managers have also been saved.

**Improving Service Attitude Is Praised by Customers**

Next, the issue of service attitude was resolved. In the past, some sales staff were very indifferent to customers and showed impatience when customers were choosing goods. For example, if a customer felt that the shoes were too big, the sales staff would reply: "It's comfortable to wear them big." If they disliked the shoes being too small, they would reply, "It fits well to wear them small." One salesperson disliked customers taking the time to pick out goods. When a customer explained, "Of course I want to buy something satisfactory with my money," this salesperson said, "You have money, go buy a Qianmen Gate tower!" Therefore, quarrels and arguments between salespeople and customers occurred constantly, and sometimes they even went to the police station to resolve disputes.

The poor service attitude of the sales staff was mainly due to the existence of bureaucracy on the part of the leadership and the lack of political and ideological work. Once this situation was changed, things were completely different. During the rectification, the leadership listened to the opinions of the masses, improved their style, and managers and section chiefs all came out of the office and talked with the sales staff to study ways to improve service attitude together. This approach by the leadership greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the sales staff, who all said: "If the leadership is determined to change, why can't we change our shortcomings?" In this way, the problem of poor service attitude was raised by the sales staff themselves. They saw the experience of Changchun Department Store in improving service attitude in the newspaper, and they learned from this experience in the spirit of catching up with the advanced. In the discussion, most people felt that this experience was good, but some people thought, "This is just to avoid customer criticism, it doesn't matter whether we learn it or not." Someone said: "When business is busy, we have to greet every customer, and the words have to be there even if the goods are not, I think this is nonsense! When we are too busy, can't the customers see it?" Some said: "Saying goodbye to customers is the style of old merchants, we don't need to learn this set." In response to these ideological problems, the leadership conducted education among the staff on how sales staff can better serve the people, fundamentally clarifying the relationship between sales staff and customers in the new society. At the same time, they also gathered the opinions of the sales staff, especially the old sales staff, absorbed the beneficial components of the traditional experience of old shop assistants in receiving customers, and jointly studied and formulated nine service pledges.

The service pledges provided all sales staff with a code of conduct, and the service attitude of the sales staff began to change, but some people had not completely changed. Ma Shihong lacked a sense of responsibility, and he actually told customers that "there is no" of the goods that were clearly displayed in the counter. At this time, other sales staff criticized him for this practice, and the leadership did not take the simple method of criticism, but patiently educated him to strengthen his sense of responsibility and treat customers kindly. Ma Shihong changed. Not long after, he received praise from customers. Later, they debated the issue of labor discipline and criticized erroneous ideas such as "sales staff are inferior" and "it doesn't matter whether you work or not, you get paid anyway."

After this series of political and ideological work, the service attitude of the sales staff has fundamentally changed, and a new atmosphere has emerged in the entire store. When the children's clothing group sold children's clothes, they measured the children again and again, for fear that the clothes would not fit. The fabric group not only enthusiastically helped customers choose fabrics, but also carefully calculated for customers to save fabric coupons and money. Liang Cai, a sales staff member of the clock and watch group, who had always had a very poor service attitude, also made a big change. He braved the wind and delivered goods to customers during his rest time, and also ran to the customer's home to repair the clock, which moved the customer to come to his door to thank him. No longer hearing the sound of sales staff arguing with customers in the store, the comrades in the police station asked strangely: "Why don't you come to us anymore?" The old ladies in the neighborhood praised with satisfaction: "Tianjin Department Store has really changed, and I feel really happy after buying things!" The service attitude of this store has become a model for stores throughout the city, and sales staff from brother stores have come to visit and learn.

**Breaking Work Rules and Regulations, Implementing One Shift Until the End**

People's thoughts guide people's actions. When people's ideological level is improved, it is reflected in their work, and they always want to break through some old restrictions that are no longer adapted to the new situation. The staff of the Tianjin Department Store is just like this. Now, they can not only immediately smell that it is wrong to do less work, be afraid of trouble, or only care about themselves and not the country, but also directly perceive that many rules and regulations and planned targets in the store are backward. The first to bear the brunt is the "eight-hour work system" implemented since 1956, which is not suitable for commercial work, and the resulting phenomenon of overstaffing and underwork. Many staff members excitedly said: People are running forward, but we are standing still, we can't continue like this! Old salesperson Li Shunkao said: "The mall should achieve less capital, fewer staff, higher labor efficiency, and more profits turned over. I suggest that we break through eight hours and reduce staff!" All the staff unanimously expressed: We must compare our vigor with the peasants. Farmers work hard day and night to build water conservancy, and the work of shop assistants must also be from morning to night in one shift! They said that although the work of shop assistants is nominally eight hours, because it is sometimes busy and sometimes idle, the actual working time is often only four or five hours, which is too inconsistent compared with the revolutionary vigor of workers and peasants. They demanded that the two-shift system be changed to one shift until the end, and that the surplus personnel be transferred to places where the country needs them, and to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. After all the staff held a general meeting on the evening of February 2 to discuss, the volunteer forms applying to go to the countryside flew to the office like snowflakes. The meeting adjourned at 11 o'clock, but everyone was unwilling to go home to sleep, and competed to write big-character posters. In a short while, colorful and overflowing with revolutionary enthusiasm big-character posters were pasted all over the wall. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members took the lead in applying to go to the countryside, and some even proposed to bring their families to settle in the countryside.

After repeated research and discussion, it was finally decided that out of the 101 people in the entire store, 46 people would be reduced, a reduction of 45%; on the issue of working hours, except for pregnant women, the physically weak, and mothers with many children, the two-shift system was changed to one shift until the end, and planned rotation was arranged for rest during non-busy business hours, and everyone would work together when there was a lot of work. When the leadership approved some of the sales staff to participate in agricultural labor, all the staff cheered, especially those who were approved to go to the countryside, who were even more ecstatic. Communist Youth League members Gu Quanmao and Zhang Zhengxiang repeatedly asked the leadership to approve them to go to the countryside, and when it was announced that they were approved to go to the countryside to work, they said to everyone they met: Put down the abacus and pick up the hoe, I will work hard in the countryside, and I want to earn first-class work points! They also challenged their partners who stayed in the store.

The number of people has been reduced, the working hours have been adjusted, and the staff is still not satisfied. After repeated careful calculations, it was proposed that 30,000 yuan should be saved throughout the year, and the quality of service should continue to be improved.

Before and after the discussion of these major issues, in accordance with the spirit of the rectification movement, in addition to correcting their own shortcomings and strengthening their ties with the masses through practical actions, the Party organization also strengthened the leadership of the trade union organization, and cadres above the group leader were responsible for conducting political and ideological work on their subordinate employees, and in conjunction with the current Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the propaganda and discussion of the political situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind was carried out among all employees. The example of leading cadres correcting shortcomings, and a series of political and ideological work, accompanied by the discussion and implementation of the three major issues in business management, further encouraged the socialist enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the broad masses of employees.

Tianjin Department Store in Beijing is one of the thousands of stores in China. This store's improvement of employee thinking to the leap forward of store work provides a good example for China's commercial work. A single spark can start a prairie fire, may this store's proposal become the starting point for the Great Leap Forward in the national commercial work. (Attached picture)

    加强政治思想工作　提高社会主义觉悟
    天桥百货商场职工举起大跃进旗帜
    减少人员一半，实行一天一班顶到底，吸收商业工作的传统经验，服务态度大改观
    本报特约新华社13日讯　如何突破落后、打破陈规、促使商业工作大跃进？北京市天桥百货商场的基本经验是：在整风运动的基础上，通过具体的政治思想工作，放手发动群众去找出和解决经营业务上的关键问题。
    前已报道，这个商店在给全市商业职工的倡议书中，根据本单位的具体情况，曾提出了以下四项奋斗目标：一、克服人多事少的现象，减少45％的职工，把他们调出来支援农业生产；二、突破对商业不适用的八小时工作制度，改“一天两班轮流上班制”为“一天一班顶到底”；三、吸收商业传统中“勤进快销、以销定进、逐层负责”的办法，节约资金37％，使资金周转率由去年的六点三七次加速到十一次；四、按照所制订的服务公约，提高服务质量，商场的领导人半天参加售货，每个售货员在本年内都成为熟悉全商场商品的全能售货员。这四条充满社会主义精神的创造性的倡议，其精神不但为社会主义商业的职工们提出了一个榜样，而且为我国的商业工作打开了跃进的大门。
    放手发动群众经营管理大有改进
    在整风运动以前，正像我国各地的很多商店一样，这个商场在工作上存在的主要问题是：人浮于事；服务态度不好；经营管理不善；而归根到底则是政治思想工作很为薄弱，职工中的社会主义正气得不到充分的发扬。在整风运动中，经过大鸣大放，这些问题就明显地被揭发出来。这个商场根据“先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜”的精神，在整改中首先集中力量解决了一批立即能够和应该解决的问题，从而提高了职工的社会主义积极性。随后就进一步从职工意见最多的问题之一——紧缩一半管理干部入手，开始处理有关改进商场工作的重大问题。
    直接领导这个商场的崇文区百货门市部经理和党支书张恒，是个转业革命军人，对于商业工作并不“内行”，但他相信群众的多数。他从群众所揭发出来的千头万绪、复杂万端的千百个问题中看到了一个可以依靠的力量：在旧社会受过剥削、压迫，但在商业经营上积有很多经验的老店员。这些老店员在大鸣大放中，对领导的批评虽然是尖锐的，但都是关于如何改进工作、改进领导作风的建设性的意见。而对于右派分子的反动言论一开始就很愤慨。这个情况启示党组织和张恒首先着重在老店员中做工作。老店员告诉张恒说：经营门市生意的传统方法，在进货方面是勤进少进，销多少，陆续进多少，快销勤进，并且把进货的权力交给售货员。这样既可省费用，省库房，少出残次品，又可以量销为进。而现在商场的情况是怎样呢？进货的不管销货，销货的不知库存；五月就购进冬季商品，办一套事要费两套资金，库存多少上下心中无数；而现有的六千多种商品绝不是少数领导干部所能管好。老店员建议领导上把进货权力下放给售货小组，以便量销为进，减少不合理的商品积压，加速资金的流转。老店员们对八小时的工作制和售货员的服务态度问题，也都提出了尖锐的批评和具体的建议。老店员们的这一席话，打开了张恒的茅塞。经过党支部的分析研究，肯定了老店员的意见，提出了具体的工作步骤，决定以老店员为核心力量，发动商场的全体职工、就经营管理上的三大问题——压缩资金、改善服务态度、减少人员问题，一个接着一个的进行了讨论，并且一面讨论一面就行动起来。
    压缩库存、加速资金流转的工作是在去年十月开始进行的。经过广大职工群众的分析研究，在增加品种、满足顾客需要的前提下，根据门市营业的特点，库存已由去年十月以前的三十一万四千元压缩到现在的十九万元。按照职工们的建议，他们除采用与其他商店换货、托销和摆摊推销等办法处理了价值十二万元的积压过多的商品外，主要采用了三种办法：一、改变一次多进的做法为以销定进，按照商品的流动规律，确定进货的数量和时速。例如宝珠牌线袜过去一次进货一百打，够卖四个月，现在改为一次进货五打，六天即可周转一次。二、按照季节转变，逐渐减少过了季的商品，逐渐增加下一季所需要的商品，改变过去季节性已过再进货和半年前即储购“季节商品”的做法。三、把进货、库存的权力交给售货小组组员直接掌握。要进什么货，要进多少，组员商量，组长决定，领导审核。经过这番改革，经营的情况就发生了极大的变化。售货员成为自己所经售的商品的主人，责任心加强了，品种增加了，但不合理的库存基本消灭了，因而资金的流转大大加速了。现在每个售货组长都知道他所经售的各种商品的库存数量，有些组长并且开始掌握了各种商品的进销规律。由于不合理的库存减少，一般商品也都可以直入货场，不需再进仓库了。有些储存较多必须进库的商品，也由各售货组分别保管，仓库的四个管理员因此也节省下来了。
    改进服务态度顾客同声称赞
    接着就解决服务态度的问题。过去有些售货员对待顾客很冷淡，对顾客挑选商品表现不耐烦，如顾客觉得鞋大，售货员就回答：“大了穿着舒服”，如嫌鞋小，就回答“小了穿着跟脚”。有个售货员嫌顾客挑选商品麻烦，顾客解释说：“我花钱当然要买称心的东西。”这位售货员就说：“你有钱，有钱买个前门楼子去！”因此售货员与顾客吵架顶嘴的事不断发生，有时还闹到派出所去解决纠纷。
    售货员的服务态度不好，主要是由于领导上存在官僚主义和缺乏政治思想工作。在一旦改变了这种情况以后，情况就完全两样了。在整风中，领导上一面听取了群众的意见，一面改进作风，经理、股长也都走出办公室，并且和售货员谈心，一起研究改进服务态度的办法。领导上这种作法，大大鼓舞了售货员的积极性，他们都说：“领导上有决心改，咱们有缺点为什么改不了？”这样，服务态度不好的问题，就由售货员自己提出来了。他们从报纸上看到长春百货商店改善服务态度的经验，就以赶先进的精神，学习这个经验。在讨论中，大部分人都觉得这个经验好，但也有些人认为“这不过是为了避免顾客的批评，学不学没什么。”有人说：“业务忙的时候，要跟每个顾客打招呼，货不到话到，我看这是废话！咱们忙不过来时，顾客不是也看见吗？”有的说：“跟顾客道别，那是旧商人作风，咱们用不着学这一套。”针对这些思想问题，领导上就在职工中进行了售货员怎样更好地为人民服务的教育，从根本上讲清新社会售货员同顾客的关系。在这同时，又集中了售货员特别是老售货员的意见，吸收了老店员接待顾客传统经验中的有益成分，共同研究制定了九项服务公约。
    服务公约使所有的售货员有了一个行动的准则，售货员的服务态度开始转变了，可是也有一些人还没有完全转变。马世鸿责任心不强，柜台里明明摆着的商品，他竟告诉顾客说“没有”，这时别的售货员就批评他这种作法不对，领导上也没有采取简单批评的办法，而是耐心地教育他加强责任心，和蔼接待顾客。马世鸿转变了。过了不久他就受到了顾客的表扬。以后，他们又辩论了劳动纪律问题，批判了“售货员低人一等”“干不干反正到时也拿钱”等错误思想。
    经过这一系列的政治思想工作，售货员的服务态度就根本改变了，整个商场出现了新的气象。童装组卖童衣的时候，给孩子量了又量，生怕孩子穿上不合适。布匹组不但热心地帮助顾客挑布，而且替顾客精打细算，节约布票和钱。一向服务态度很不好的钟表组售货员梁才，也来了一个大转变。他冒着大风，在休息时间给顾客送货，还跑到顾客家里去修钟，感动得顾客登门向他道谢。商场里不再听到售货员和顾客吵架的声音，派出所的同志奇怪地问：“你们怎么老也不找我们啦？”街坊老太太满意地称赞：“天桥百货商场可真变样儿了，买完东西心里真痛快！”这个商场的服务态度，成了全市商店的榜样，前来参观学习的兄弟商店的售货员络绎不绝。
    打破作息陈规实行一班顶到底
    人们的思想是指导人们的行动的。人们的思想水平提高了，反映在工作上，它就总想突破那陈旧的、不再与新形势相适应的一些束缚。天桥百货商场的职工正是这样。现在，他们不但对那种少做事、怕麻烦或者只顾个人不顾国家的行为能够立即嗅出它是错误的，而且直接地觉察到商店内很多规章制度和计划指标落后了。首当其冲的就是1956年开始实行的不适合商业工作的“八小时工作制”，以及由此带来的人浮于事的现象。很多职工激动地说：人家是跑步向前，咱们是原地踏步，不能再这样下去了！老售货员李顺考说：“商场应该作到资金少、人员少、劳动效率高、上缴利润多。我建议我们要突破八小时，要减少人员！”全体职工一致表示：要跟农民比干劲。农民披星戴月兴水利，店员的工作也要从早到晚一班顶！他们说，店员的工作名义上虽为八小时，但由于有时忙，有时闲，实际劳动时间常常只有四、五小时，这和工人、农民的革命干劲比较起来，太不相称了。他们要求把两班制改为一班顶到底，把多余的人员调送到国家需要的地方去，到农村参加农业生产。在2月2日晚上全体职工开大会讨论以后，申请到农村去的志愿书，像雪片似地飞到办公室。十一时散的会，大家还不肯回家睡觉，争着写大字报。不一会，花花绿绿的、洋溢着革命热情的大字报就贴了满墙。共产党员、共青团员带头申请到农村去，有的还提出携带家属到农村去落户。
    经过反复的研究讨论，最后决定在全店一百零一人中，减去四十六人，减少45％；在工作时间的问题上，除对孕妇、体弱和子女多的妈妈分别情况予以照顾外，决定把两班制改成一班顶到底，在营业不忙的时间内有计划地轮换下柜休息，活多的时候一起来干。当领导上批准一部分售货员参加农业劳动的时候，全体职工欢声四起，特别是那些被批准到农村去的人，更是欢天喜地。共青团员顾全茂、张正相三番五次地要求领导上批准他到农村去，当宣布他被批准去农村劳动的时候，他们逢人就说：放下算盘，拿起锄头，我要在农村好好劳动，要挣头等工分！他们还向留在门市部的伙伴们挑战。
    人员减少了，工时调整了，职工们还不满意。经过反复地算细账，又提出全年要节约费用三万元，还要继续提高服务质量。
    在对这些重大问题进行讨论的前后，领导干部按照整风运动的精神，除用实际行动改正自己的缺点和加强了同群众的联系外，党组织还加强了对工会组织的领导，组长以上干部都负责对所属职工进行政治思想工作，并且结合当前的工农业生产大跃进，在全体职工中进行了东风压倒西风的政治形势的宣传和讨论。领导干部改正缺点的榜样，一系列的政治思想工作，伴随着经营管理上的三大问题的讨论和执行，就进一步鼓舞了广大职工的社会主义积极性和责任心。
    北京天桥百货商场是我国千万个商店中的一个商店。这个商店从提高职工思想到商店工作跃进，对于我国商业工作提供了一个良好的范例。星星之火，可以燎原，愿这个商店的倡议成为全国商业工作大跃进的起点。（附图片）
