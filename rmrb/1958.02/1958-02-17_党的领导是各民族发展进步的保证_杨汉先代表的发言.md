The Party's Leadership is the Guarantee for the Development and Progress of All Nationalities
Speech by Representative Yang Hanxian

I fully endorse the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I would like to express some opinions on the ethnic work in Guizhou Province, and I welcome criticism and suggestions from the representatives.

The Leap Forward Development of Various Undertakings in Ethnic Regions is a Great Victory for the Party's Ethnic Policy

In recent years, great progress has been made in our province's ethnic work. We have implemented the central government's ethnic policies, and two autonomous prefectures and three autonomous counties have been established throughout the province, realizing ethnic regional autonomy. In addition, more than one hundred ethnic townships have been established, and the ethnic townships that should have been established have basically been established. With the rapid development of various tasks in ethnic regions, a large number of minority cadres have been trained. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 15,000 ethnic cadres in the province. The vast majority of ethnic cadres have made great progress and improvement in politics and work in recent years. They have undertaken various tasks and played a significant role in their work. Ethnic regions have achieved cooperativization. According to statistics from the two autonomous prefectures last autumn, the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives accounted for about 85 percent of the total number of peasant households, basically realizing advanced cooperativization. In addition, with the strong support from the central government in recent years, such as issuing agricultural loans totaling more than 55.44 million yuan in minority areas; various relief funds of 8.22 million yuan; and issuing free agricultural tool funds of 2.5 million yuan, which can be made into more than 1 million pieces of various iron and new-style agricultural tools. Therefore, grain production in ethnic regions of our province has increased year after year. For example, Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture increased its production by 11 percent in 1957 compared to the previous year, with grain output reaching more than 1.44 billion jin. Qian Nan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture increased its production by 12 percent last year, with a grain output of more than 1.47 billion jin. Other production undertakings have also developed greatly. Due to the development of production, cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 360,000 minority primary school students in the province, an increase of more than 164 percent compared to 1952; and about 17,000 minority middle school students, an increase of more than 181 percent compared to 1952. In individual counties, the enrollment rate of school-age children from ethnic minorities has reached 58 percent of the total number of school-age children. In terms of health work: now every county has a hospital, and every district has a health center. Acute infectious diseases that used to be prevalent in ethnic regions, such as smallpox and relapsing fever, have been basically eliminated. The incidence of malaria has been greatly reduced, from 8.34 percent in 1956 to 1.91 percent in 1957. The cultural life and health level of the people in ethnic regions have been greatly improved. These facts fully demonstrate that the achievements of our province's ethnic work are significant. This is the glorious victory of the ethnic policies of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Of course, there are still many shortcomings in our ethnic work, which we must strive to overcome to do the work even better.

Without the Leadership of the Party and the Help of the Han Nationality, Ethnic Minorities Could Not Develop and Progress

In addition, I would like to talk about the fact that some people in our ethnic minorities have serious local nationalism ideas. For example, some people do not obey the Party's unified and centralized leadership, and say that the Party's unified leadership is "monopoly and replacement." We want to ask, without the Party's unified leadership, could our ethnic minorities have stood up? In just a few years, could the political, economic, and cultural undertakings in our ethnic minority areas have achieved such tremendous development? Our ethnic minority people deeply understand that this is only possible because of the Party's leadership. Our ethnic minorities sincerely thank the Party and Chairman Mao. The Communist Party is the leading core of our socialist construction. Without the Party's unified and centralized leadership, there would be no socialism, and it would be fundamentally impossible for our ethnic minorities to embark on the road to prosperity and happiness. Aren't those who have this kind of local nationalism thinking trying to leave socialism and take the capitalist road? This is contrary to the interests of the people of all our nationalities. We absolutely cannot allow it. In addition, some people, under the pretext of the nationalization of autonomous organs, exclude Han cadres. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the vast majority of Han cadres have wholeheartedly served the people, fearing no hardship, and working with our ethnic minorities in ethnic regions. The great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction in our ethnic regions cannot be separated from the efforts and help of Han cadres. Obviously, this kind of thinking that excludes Han cadres is detrimental to the unity and mutual assistance of the people of all our nationalities, and especially detrimental to the progress and development of our own nationalities. Its essence is still another manifestation of leaving the Party's leadership and leaving socialism. We must see that the harmfulness of local nationalism thinking to our socialist construction is very great, and it must be thoroughly criticized.

Rightists Who Brandish the Banner of Ethnicity are the Dregs of the Nation and Enemies of the People

What deserves our deep vigilance even more is that some people, brandishing the banner of ethnicity and appearing as representatives of ethnic interests, carry out conspiracies to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, split the motherland's big family, and undermine ethnic unity. Ou Baichuan and Wang Tianxi, rightists among ethnic minorities in our province, used the guise of "for ethnic interests" to disguise themselves, taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to frantically attack the Party and the people. They contacted people everywhere, wooed people, secretly organized reactionary small groups, and carried out various anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist criminal activities. Ou Baichuan, in carrying out the reactionary signature campaign, threatened people, saying: "Those who disagree or do not sign are Han chauvinists"; Wang Tianxi incited people, saying: "We are still being oppressed by Han chauvinism." Their criminal activities of undermining unity and splitting the unity of the motherland aroused unanimous anger among the people of all ethnic groups in our province after they were exposed. As representatives of the National People's Congress, their words and actions betrayed the fundamental principles of the Constitution and the interests of their own ethnic groups. They are the dregs of our ethnic minorities and enemies of the people. The people of all ethnic groups in our province demand that they be severely punished. The decision of this conference not to allow them to attend the meeting and to remove them from their positions as members of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress is very correct, and we fully support it.

There is also a Struggle Between Two Roads Among Ethnic Minorities - Socialist Education is Very Necessary

It should be seen that our country is still in a period of transition, and there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Such a struggle between two roads also exists in our ethnic minority areas. Therefore, we fully support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction to carry out rectification and socialist education among ethnic minorities, and to criticize local nationalism. It is necessary to deeply criticize and overcome local nationalism ideological tendencies so that our ethnic minorities can, under the leadership of the Party and in the unified family of the motherland, take the socialist road of prosperity and strength. Our province is now carrying out criticism of local nationalism thinking. At the same time, among the broad masses of people in ethnic regions, in conjunction with various practical tasks, a great debate is being carried out on the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The unity among all ethnic groups has been further strengthened, and the political enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses is very high, with a special revolutionary drive, setting off production movements such as water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. We have full confidence that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will resolutely implement the central government's ethnic policies, and develop the various construction undertakings in our ethnic minority areas more, faster, better, and more economically; and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the glorious tasks assigned to us in the 1958 national economic plan.

### 党的领导是各民族发展进步的保证  杨汉先代表的发言

    党的领导是各民族发展进步的保证
    杨汉先代表的发言
    我完全拥护李先念、薄一波两位副总理和彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的报告。现在我就贵州省的民族工作发表一点意见，请代表们批评指正。
    民族地区各项事业飞跃发展  是党的民族政策的伟大胜利
    几年来，我省的民族工作有了很大的发展。我们贯彻执行了中央的民族政策，全省已建立了两个自治州、三个自治县，实现了民族区域自治。此外还建立了一百多个民族乡，应该建立的民族乡已基本上建立起来了。随着民族地区各项工作的迅速发展，培养了大批少数民族干部，据不完全统计，全省现有民族干部一万五千多人。绝大多数的民族干部几年来在政治上、工作上都有很大的进步和提高，他们担负了各项工作，并在工作中起了很大的作用。民族地区已经实现了合作化。据两个自治州去年秋季的统计，加入高级合作社的农户已经占总农户的百分之八十五左右，基本上实现了高级合作化。加以几年来中央的大力扶持，如在少数民族地区发放了农贷款共五千五百四十四万多元；各种救济款八百二十二万元；发放了无偿农具款二百五十万元，可以制成各种铁质和新式农具一百多万件。因此，连年来，我省民族地区粮食都增产。如黔东南苗族侗族自治州一九五七年比前一年增产了百分之十一，粮食产量达到十四亿四千多万斤。黔南布依族苗族自治州去年增产百分之十二，粮食产量达到十四亿七千多万斤。其他各项生产事业都有很大的发展。由于生产的发展，文教卫生事业也有很大的发展。据不完全统计，全省现有在校少数民族小学生三十六万余人，比一九五二年增长了百分之一百六十四以上；在校少数民族中学生约一万七千多人，比一九五二年增长了百分之一百八十一以上。有个别县的少数民族学龄儿童入学率，已达学龄儿童总数的百分之五十八。卫生工作：现在县县已有医院，区区已有卫生所。过去民族地区经常流行的急性传染病，如天花、回归热已基本消灭。疟疾的发病率有了很大的降低，已由一九五六年的百分之八点三四降低到一九五七年的百分之一点九一。民族地区人民的文化生活和健康水平，大大地提高了。这些事实充分说明了我省民族工作的成绩是很大的。这是党中央和毛主席的民族政策的光辉胜利。当然，在我们的民族工作中还有许多缺点，我们必须努力克服，把工作做得更好。
    没有党的领导和汉族的帮助  少数民族就不可能发展进步
    另外，我要谈一谈，在我们少数民族中，有的人存在着严重的地方民族主义思想。例如有的人不服从党的统一集中领导，把党的统一领导说成是“包办代替”。我们要问，如果没有党的统一领导，我们少数民族能够翻身吗？短短几年间，我们少数民族地区的政治、经济、文化事业能获得这样巨大的发展吗？我们少数民族人民深深地懂得这都是因为有了党的领导才有可能办到的。我们少数民族衷心地感激党和毛主席。共产党是我们建设社会主义的领导核心。如果没有党的统一集中的领导，就一定没有社会主义，我们少数民族要想走向繁荣幸福的道路是根本不可能的。有这种地方民族主义思想的人，不正是想离开社会主义而走资本主义的道路吗？这是与我们各民族人民的利益相违背的。我们绝对不能容许。又如有的人借口自治机关的民族化，排斥汉族干部。解放以来，在党的领导下，绝大多数的汉族干部忠心耿耿为人民服务，不畏任何艰苦，在民族地区和我们少数民族在一起进行工作。我们民族地区社会主义改造和社会主义建设取得的巨大成绩，都是与汉族干部的努力和帮助分不开的。很显然这种排斥汉族干部的思想，是对我们各民族人民的团结和互助不利的，尤其不利于本民族的进步和发展。其实质，仍然是离开党的领导、离开社会主义的另一种表现。我们必须看到地方民族主义思想对于我们社会主义建设事业的危害性是很大的，必须彻底进行批判。
    打着民族招牌的右派分子是民族的败类是人民的敌人
    更值得我们深为警惕的是：有的人打着民族的招牌，以代表民族利益的面貌出现，进行反党反社会主义和分裂祖国大家庭、破坏民族团结的阴谋活动。我省少数民族中的右派分子欧百川、王天锡就是打着“为民族利益”的幌子，把自己伪装起来，乘党整风之机，猖狂地向党向人民进攻。他们到处联络人，拉拢人，秘密组织反动小集团，进行各种反党反人民反社会主义的罪恶活动。欧百川在搞反动的签名运动中，威胁人们说：“不同意或不签名的就是大汉族主义”；王天锡煽动人们说：“现在我们还是受大汉族主义的压迫”。他们这种破坏团结、分裂祖国统一的罪恶活动，经揭发后，激起了我省各族人民一致的愤怒。他们身为全国人民代表大会代表，而言论行动背叛了宪法的根本原则，背叛了本民族的利益。他们是我们少数民族的败类，是人民的敌人。我省各族人民都要求给予他们严厉的惩处。这次大会决议不让他们出席会议并罢免了他们全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员的职务是十分正确的，我们完全拥护。
    少数民族中也有两条道路斗争  进行社会主义教育非常必要
    应该看到，我们国家还处在过渡时期，存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路的斗争。这样的两条道路的斗争，在我们少数民族地区也同样是存在的。因此，我们完全拥护邓小平同志关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育、批判地方民族主义的指示。必须深入批判和克服地方民族主义思想倾向，我们少数民族才能在党的领导下，在祖国统一大家庭中，走繁荣昌盛的社会主义道路。现在我省正在开展对地方民族主义思想的批判，同时，在民族地区的广大人民群众中，结合各项实际工作开展了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论。各民族之间的团结进一步增强了，广大干部和人民群众的政治积极性很高，革命干劲特别大，掀起了兴修水利、积肥等生产运动。我们有充分信心在党中央和毛主席英明领导下，坚决贯彻执行中央的民族政策，把我们少数民族地区的各项建设事业，又多、又快、又好、又省的开展起来；保证完成和超额完成一九五八年国民经济计划中所给予我们的光荣任务。
