Different Attitudes, Different Results
    Huangyan Actively Promotes, Double-Share Plows Largely Play a Role
    Yin County Relaxes Leadership, Double-Share Plows Mostly Returned

    (Reported by this newspaper) Zhejiang Daily reported: In 1956, based on agricultural cooperativization, Huangyan and Yin County in Zhejiang Province each promoted more than 1,000 double-wheeled, double-share plows, but the fate of the double-share plows in the two counties was completely different. In 1957, the double-share plows already promoted in Huangyan County were basically put into production, and the utilization rate was also higher than in 1956, resulting in significant increased production. In Yin County, except for the 29 units gifted to agricultural cooperatives by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and workers, and those awarded to model workers, all the double-share plows were returned to the local supply and marketing cooperatives.

    In 1956, Huangyan County promoted 1,328 double-share plows. After appropriate allocation in the spring of 1957, the county still had 1,301 double-share plows. Of these, 919 were fully utilized, accounting for 70.6%, cultivating a total of 51,097 mu of land, with an average of 55.6 mu of land cultivated per plow. In the second half of the year, another 27 units were promoted. In 1956, Yin County promoted 1,065 double-share plows, with 930 put into spring plowing, cultivating a total of 44,937 mu of land, with an average of 48.32 mu of land cultivated per plow. In the spring plowing of 1957, only 233 units were used, a decrease of 74% compared to 1956. By July, plows were blindly returned on a large scale, with 1,036 units returned, accounting for 97.3% of the original number of plows, creating a negative impact among the masses.

    From the perspective of the specific conditions for using double-share plows, was Huangyan superior to Yin County? The opposite is true. Many areas in Yin County are much better than Huangyan. Double-share plows are most suitable for promotion in plain areas, and can also be used in hilly areas and flat areas on mountains, but are difficult to use in terraced fields in mountainous areas. According to preliminary investigations, the area of cultivated land in the plains of Yin County is 69,000 mu more than that of Huangyan. Secondly, the fields in Yin County are also larger, while the fields in Huangyan County are smaller. Looking at the number of draft cattle, Huangyan has more than Yin County, but the vast majority of Huangyan are yellow cattle, which are very small and unevenly distributed. Due to the abundance of mountains and scarcity of plains, each ox in the plain area has to bear the task of cultivating 35 mu of land, while in Yin County, each ox in the plain area only bears 28.9 mu.

    Since the conditions for promoting and using double-share plows in Yin County are better than those in Huangyan, why were double-share plows successfully promoted in Huangyan, but all returned in Yin County? The most important reason is that the Huangyan County Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a positive and supportive attitude towards new things. In the spring of 1957, they widely collected and summarized typical experiences of successful use and increased production with double-share plows throughout the county, and used real people and real events for publicity. Through various meetings, more than 10,000 cadres throughout the county received a profound education, realizing that actively using double-share plows was an important measure to improve agricultural production and achieve the goal of 800 jin of grain per mu in the county, thus fundamentally overcoming the right-leaning conservative thinking of cadres and the masses. Yin County, on the other hand, relaxed ideological education. In the spring of 1957, only one cadre symposium was held in the county for this purpose, and the understanding was not unified, resulting in the work drifting freely.

    Secondly, Huangyan County had already cultivated a group of cadres and farm tool technicians in 1956. In the spring of 1957, they universally opened double-share plow usage skill training classes, holding 35 sessions and training 1,746 farm tool technicians. During the spring plowing period, they also organized a large number of cadres to divide and contract areas, going deep into the cooperatives to specifically guide the members to master the use of double-share plows. Although Yin County also planned to hold a 50-person training class, only more than 20 people attended, and it was temporarily changed to a symposium that lasted for two days. Neither the technology was learned, nor were the ideological problems resolved. During the spring plowing period, they also did not pay attention to the guidance of double-share plow usage skills.

    At the same time, Huangyan County attached great importance to solving various specific problems arising in the process of using double-share plows. For example, they organized "semi-mechanized cultivation teams" to implement the "five fixed and three guarantees" (fixed fields, fixed cattle, fixed people, fixed work points, fixed quality, and guarantee of protecting plows, protecting cattle, and guaranteeing teaching of technology) management system; organized "double-share plow farming teams" to plan fields and build roads; and sent special personnel to summarize experiences and widely introduce and promote them, so that advanced experiences were developed and improved. Yin County also created some experience in the use of double-share plows in 1956, but it did not receive encouragement and support from the leadership, and therefore did not play a role.

    In addition, in order to solve the contradiction of few draft cattle in the plains and many draft cattle in the mountains, Huangyan County adopted a positive method of adjusting draft cattle, and held several draft cattle appraisal and exchange conferences. Through exchanges, more than 5,000 draft cattle were rented, and 600 were purchased from other places. The original 27 double-share plows promoted to the mountainous areas of Wuyan and Ningxi have also been actively recovered and transferred to the plains. Yin County did not actively carry out draft cattle adjustment work.

    It is precisely because the leaders of the two counties adopted two different attitudes towards new things, and the work they did was different, that different results were produced. (Attached table)

　　态度不同　效果两样
    黄岩积极倡导，双铧犁大部发挥作用
    鄞县放松领导，双铧犁大部退了回来
    本报讯　浙江日报报道：1956年，浙江省黄岩和鄞县在农业合作化的基础上，各推广了双轮双铧犁一千多部，但双轮双铧犁在两县的遭遇却完全两样。1957年黄岩县已推广的双铧犁基本上都投入了生产，使用率比1956年也有所提高，获得了显著的增产。而鄞县除中国人民解放军、工人赠送给农业社的和奖励给劳动模范的二十九部外，全部双铧犁都退回了当地的供销合作社。
    黄岩县在1956年推广了双铧犁一千三百二十八部，1957年春经过适当调配，全县尚有双铧犁一千三百零一部，春耕中完全发挥作用的有九百十九部，占70.6％，共耕田五万一千零九十七亩，平均每部使用起来的双铧犁耕田五十五点六亩；下半年又继续推广了二十七部。鄞县在1956年推广了双铧犁一千零六十五部，有九百三十部投入春耕生产，共耕田四万四千九百三十七亩，每部使用起来的双铧犁平均耕田四十八点三二亩；1957年春耕中使用起来的只有二百三十三部，比1956年下降了74％，到7月间，就大规模地盲目退犁，退回了一千零三十六部，占原有犁数的97.3％，在群众中造成了不好的影响。
    从使用双铧犁的具体条件来看，黄岩是不是比鄞县优越呢？事实恰恰相反，鄞县很多地方要比黄岩好得多。双铧犁最适宜在平原地区推广，半山区和山上的平坦地区也可以使用，在山区梯田里是难于使用的。据初步调查，鄞县平原地区的耕地面积比黄岩多六万九千亩。其次，鄞县田块也较大，黄岩县的田块较小。再从耕牛的数量看，黄岩比鄞县多，但是黄岩绝大多数是黄牛，体型很小，分布又不平衡。由于山区多、平原少，平原地区每头牛要负担三十五亩田的耕作任务，而鄞县平原区每头牛只负担二十八点九亩。
    既然鄞县推广和使用双铧犁的条件比黄岩好，为什么双铧犁在黄岩能够推广得开，而在鄞县却全部退回了呢？最主要的原因是中共黄岩县委对新生事物是采取了积极扶持的态度。1957年春，他们广泛搜集和总结了全县使用双铧犁成功和增产的典型经验，以活人活事来进行宣传，通过各种会议，使全县一万多人次的干部受到了一次深刻的教育，认识到积极使用双铧犁是提高农业生产和实现全县亩产粮食八百斤的重要措施，因而基本上克服了干部和群众的右倾保守思想。而鄞县则放松了思想教育工作，1957年春全县为此仅开过一次干部座谈会，认识也未统一，结果工作形成自流。
    其次，黄岩县1956年已经培养了一批干部和农具手，1957年春又普遍开办了双铧犁使用技术训练班，共办了三十五次，训练了农具手一千七百四十六人。在春耕期间，他们又组织大批干部，分片包干，深入到社，具体指导社员掌握双铧犁的使用技术。鄞县虽然也打算举办一次五十人的训练班，但结果只到了二十多人，临时改为座谈会，开了两天，技术既未学会，思想问题也没有解决。在春耕期间，他们也没有注意双铧犁使用技术的指导工作。
    同时，黄岩县很重视解决使用双铧犁过程中所产生的各种具体问题。例如，他们组织了“半机械化耕作小队”，实行“五定三保”（定田、定牛、定人、定工分、定质量和保护犁、保护牛、保证教会技术）的经营管理制度；组织了“双铧犁耕田队”，规划田块、修筑道路等；又派专人总结经验，广泛介绍推广，使先进经验得到了发展和提高。鄞县在1956年也曾创造了一些使用双铧犁的经验，但是没有得到领导上的鼓励和支持，因而未发挥作用。
    此外，为了解决平原耕牛少、山区耕牛多的矛盾，黄岩县采取了积极调剂耕牛的办法，开了多次耕牛评比交流大会。通过交流，租赁了耕牛五千多头，向外地买进了六百头。原来推广到乌岩、宁溪一带山区的二十七部双铧犁，也已经主动收了回来，全部转让到平原地区。鄞县就没有积极进行耕牛调剂工作。
    正是由于两个县的领导上对待新生事物采取了两种不同的态度，所做的工作不同，因此也就产生了不同的效果。（附图表）
