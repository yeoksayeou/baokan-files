    Celebrating Tibetan New Year in Lhasa
    Geng Yu Fang
　　Today is the Tibetan New Year of the Earth Dog, and also the seventh spring since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Tibetan compatriots are advancing on the road of "unity, progress, and greater development." The Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region has announced the exemption of the "labor tax" for Tibetan cadres and Tibetan students, and nearly ten thousand Tibetan youths have been mobilized to study in revolutionary schools across the country... The Tibetan people are spreading their wings and flying towards a bright future in the socialist spring breeze.

    I spent the Fire Monkey (1956) and Fire Rooster (1957) Tibetan New Year festivals in Lhasa with my Tibetan teachers, friends, and classmates. This year, celebrating the New Year in Beijing, I cannot help but miss and recall those grand and fascinating days.

    On the 29th day of the 12th month of the Tibetan calendar, the New Year atmosphere begins in every household. According to custom, all families must first expel the demons and ghosts from their homes. They use tsampa to make a kind of food called "Torma" and throw it to domestic animals and birds, or clear out the garbage and dirt from their homes, which is said to eliminate disasters and bring a peaceful life to the whole family.

    On the evening of that day, every household drinks "Laba Congee" (called "Guthuk" in Tibetan), which is a very interesting eating game. Laba Congee contains nine kinds of edible things, such as radish, ginseng fruit, peas, dried cheese residue, and mutton. One of them is "Pathuk," made of dough in various shapes, some like arrows, some like spindles, some like tongues..., and it also contains various symbols such as chili peppers, lead blocks, wool, needles, and salt. When drinking the congee, if an arrow appears in a man's bowl, it is an auspicious sign, indicating that everything will go well for him; if a spindle appears in a woman's bowl, it is a symbol of abundant food and clothing, telling her that she can wear good pulu (a kind of woolen fabric). In addition, whether male or female, if a tongue-shaped "Pathuk" appears in the bowl, it is a precursor to lawsuits and gossiping; if a chili pepper appears, it means that this person is sharp-tongued and does not let others speak; if a lead block appears, it means that this person is heavy-assed and a lazy person who does not like to work; if a needle appears, it means that this person can pass through all barriers and be victorious in every battle... The Tibetan people say that each person should drink nine bowls of "Laba Congee". In fact, of course, it is difficult to do.

    On New Year's Eve, every household replaces the prayer flags on the roof and the curtains on the doors and windows with brand new ones, fluttering in the wind. On the table for worshiping gods in the room, a plate of pastries, ghee, ginseng fruit, fruits, and other offerings are stacked high; a pot of young barley seedlings is also placed, representing people's wishes for a good harvest. Most of the walls are hung with color photos of Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni together in Beijing during the Water Sheep Year, expressing their boundless love for the people's leader.

    On New Year's Day, Tibetan compatriots get up very early, fully dressed, and light the lamps for worshiping gods. Family members offer hadas to each other in order of age to congratulate each other, and the offerer says the congratulatory words: "May you have good luck and complete happiness." The recipient replies: "It will definitely be like this."

    On the fourth day, the annual Monlam Festival begins and continues until the 25th. This is a grand festival for pilgrimage, and lamas from the three major monasteries in Lhasa and other places gather in Lhasa. There are also farmers and herdsmen from all over the country, bringing tsampa, ghee, wool, and other commodities to exchange goods, forming a materials exchange conference. At this time, the Lhasa urban area is full of lamas in red robes and newcomers speaking various dialects. Men and women, old and young, turn this capital of Tibet into a bustling city filled with incense and crowded people.

    On the sixth day, the Dalai Lama goes from the Potala Palace to the Jokhang Temple to preach to monks and lay believers. In order to facilitate preaching and chanting during the Monlam Festival, the government has specially installed electric lights and amplifiers in the Jokhang Temple... The monks and lay people all feel the true meaning of freedom of religious belief.

    On the fifteenth day of the first month, Lhasa also has a lantern festival. Various large and small lanterns are hung on Barkhor Street. Standing on the high rooftops and looking towards the urban area, you can see thousands of lights, illuminating the whole city with splendor.

    In this way, the New Year passes in the cheers of the crowd. The weather gradually warms up, and the Tibetan people begin their hard work. The farmers drive yaks, hold iron shovels, and begin plowing, irrigating, and sowing on their land; the herdsmen lead cattle and sheep, galloping on the hillsides and grasslands.

    On this Tibetan New Year's Day, my emotions are boiling like a furnace of red-hot iron. In the heart of the motherland, I deeply bless my Tibetan compatriots...

    在拉萨过藏历新年
    耿予方
　　今天是藏历土狗新年元旦，也是西藏人民和平解放后的第七个春天。藏族同胞正在“团结、进步、更加发展”的道路上前进着，自治区筹委会公布了免除藏族干部和藏族学员的“人役税”，调动了近万名西藏青少年到各地革命学校里去学习……。西藏人民正在社会主义的春风里展翅飞翔、向着美好的明天。
    我曾在拉萨同我的藏族老师、朋友、同学一起度过了火猴（1956年）火鸡（1957年）两个藏历新年佳节。今年在北京过年，不由得怀念和回忆起那些隆重的引人入胜的日子来了。
    藏历12月29日，新年气氛就在家家户户开始了。所有人家按例得首先把家中妖魔鬼怪驱逐出去，他们用?粑做成一种叫“刀马”的食物扔给家畜飞鸟，或者把家中垃圾污物清除出去，据说这样就能消灭全家的灾难和得到安乐的生活。
    当天晚上，家家户户都要喝“腊九粥”（藏话叫“古吐”），这是一次很有趣味的吃饭游戏。腊九粥中放有萝卜、人参果、豌豆、干奶渣、牛羊肉等九种吃的东西。其中一种是用面皮做成各式各样的“帕吐”，有的像箭，有的像纺锤，有的像舌头……，还在里面放上辣椒、铅块、羊毛、针、盐等各种象征品。喝粥时，男子碗里出现箭，那是大吉大利之兆，预示他万事如意；女子碗里出现纺锤，那是衣食丰足的标志，告诉她可以穿上好的氆氇（用羊毛做成的一种衣料）。此外，无论男女，如果碗里出现舌形“帕吐”，即是招致打官司饶舌头的先声；如果出现辣椒，是说这人口齿尖锐，话不让人；如果出现铅块，就说明这人屁股很重，是一个不好劳动的懒汉；如果出现针，是说明这人可以通过一切关口，百战百胜……。藏族人民说，“腊九粥”，每人应喝九碗。事实上当然是很难办到的。
    除夕那天，家家户户都把房顶上的经旗、门窗上的幔联，换成崭新的，迎风招展。在屋子里敬神的桌子上放一盘糕点、酥油、人参果、水果等叠得高高的祭品；还放一盆青稞嫩苗，表示人们对丰收的愿望。墙上大部分挂着毛主席和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼在北京过水羊年时合照的彩色像片，表示他们对人民领袖的无比敬爱。
    元旦这天，藏族同胞绝早起来，全身盛装，点上敬神的灯火。家人按老幼次序互献哈达祝贺，献者致祝词说：“吉祥如意，幸福圆满。”受者致答词道：“一定会这样的”。
    初四，一年一度的传召大会开始了，并且一直要延续到25日为止。这是一个朝佛的盛节，拉萨三大寺和各地的喇嘛汇集在拉萨。还有来自山南海北的农牧民，带着糌粑、酥油、羊毛等商品来以有易无，形成一次物资交流大会。这时，拉萨市区到处是穿红袈裟的喇嘛和操着各种方言的新人，男男女女、老老少少，把这个西藏的首府变成了一个香烟缭绕人群密挤的闹市。
    初六，达赖喇嘛从布达拉宫到大昭寺去，为僧俗教徒讲经。政府为了照顾传召期间讲经和诵经的方便，还特地在大昭寺装设电灯、安上扩大器……。僧俗人民都感受到了宗教信仰自由的真情。
    正月十五日，拉萨也有一个花灯晚会。在八角街上悬着各种各样的大灯小灯，站在高高的房顶上向市区望去，可以看到数千盏灯，照得全城光辉灿烂。
    就这样，新年在万众欢腾声中过去了。天气渐渐地暖和起来，藏族人民开始了辛勤的劳动，于是，农民们赶着牦牛、手持铁锹，又在自己的土地上开始翻地、浇田、播种；牧民们又领着牛群羊群，奔驰在山坡和草地上。
    在这藏历新年的日子，我的感情像一炉烧红的铁汁在沸腾着。我在祖国的心脏，向西藏同胞深深祝福……。
