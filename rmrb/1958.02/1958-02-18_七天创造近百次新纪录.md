Seven Days of Creating Nearly a Hundred New Records

(Our report) Tianjin Dagukou Chemical Plant employees, in the seven-day production leap forward review from January 30th to February 5th, broke through all the factory's equipment capacity quotas and work-hour quotas, successively creating nearly a hundred new records, further increasing labor productivity.

On the eve of the review's commencement, the plant's employees checked the production equipment overnight and then bravely threw themselves into the competition. On the first morning, before dawn, many targets were broken through. The electrolysis workshop is the factory's first process; they had increased the current density by 20% in mid-December of last year. This time, they further strengthened cooperation and close coordination, increasing the current density by another 6%. Then, good news came from the power workers, who doubled the steam pressure. The electrolysis and power department employees had a successful start, and the entire factory was in high spirits, with reports of new records flying in like snowflakes. In the chlorine crude crystal group, the output of Zhang Maosen's team first broke through the planned target, but it was not long before it was refreshed by Li Zhihong's team. The next day, Zhang Maosen's team caught up again.

    七天创造近百次新纪录
    本报讯　天津市大沽化工厂职工在从1月30日到2月5日举行的七天生产跃进大检阅中，冲破了全厂所有的设备能力定额和工时定额指标，先后创造新纪录近百次，进一步提高了劳动生产率。
    在大检阅开始前夕，这个厂的职工连夜检查了生产设备，随即奋勇投入竞赛。第一天早晨，天还没有亮，许多指标就被突破了。电解车间是全厂第一道工序，他们在去年12月中旬曾把电流密度提高了20％，这次他们进一步加强协作，密切配合，又把电流密度提高了6％。接着，又传来了动力工人的捷报，他们把蒸汽压力提高了一倍。电解和动力部门职工旗开得胜，全厂人心振奋，创造新纪录的捷报，雪片飞来。在氯气粗晶组，张茂森班的产量首先突破了计划指标，可是保持不久，又被李志洪班刷新了。第二天张茂森班工人又赶上去。
