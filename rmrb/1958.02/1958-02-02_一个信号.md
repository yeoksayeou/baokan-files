    The mutual aid agricultural cooperative in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, has seen a great leap forward in production over the past two years. The cooperative's public accumulation has increased significantly, and the income of the members has also increased substantially. Last year, the cooperative's public accumulation and member investments, after deducting expenses for production and capital construction, still had more than 280,000 yuan, and they felt they had nowhere to use it. This year, the whole cooperative expects to accumulate more than 400,000 yuan. The current income of the members, in addition to purchasing daily necessities, building houses, and investing in the cooperative, also leaves them with surplus money of more than 130,000 yuan. This year's income will be even greater. Although there are not many such agricultural cooperatives at present, with the leap in production, there will definitely be more and more. This raises some new issues that deserve attention.
    This is a signal, and its shining light indicates that the horse of agriculture is galloping and "taking the lead," demanding that other departments rise up and catch up. The agricultural cooperative's strong funds need to find avenues for expanded reproduction, which poses a series of questions for industrial, commercial, cultural education, and scientific research departments: The agricultural cooperative needs to use this money to purchase agricultural machinery to replace heavy manual labor. How will the industrial sector meet this need? With the agricultural machinery going to the countryside, is the technical guidance and machinery repair force sufficient? The demand for cultural life in rural areas is growing. Do cultural education departments have plans and actions to adapt to this situation? The demand for means of production and means of livelihood in rural areas has increased, bringing heavy purchasing and marketing tasks to commercial and supply and marketing departments. What will these departments do? Will they follow conventional practices, or will they catch up?
    In this regard, the various machinery factories in Beijing have adopted revolutionary methods. These factories originally only accepted the state-assigned task of manufacturing 16,000 horsepower of agricultural power machinery and equipment; but because order forms from the countryside kept pouring in, the planned output increased again and again. As a result, they undertook the manufacturing task of 53,000 horsepower in the production of boiler-locomotives and gas engines alone. Some factories that had never produced gas engines also accepted production tasks; some non-agricultural machinery factories are also preparing to produce dozens of currently urgently needed tractor parts such as oil pumps and oil plugs. In order to meet the needs of agricultural production development, the relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province have also actively carried out many beneficial tasks. This proactive spirit can be taken as an example. Without being proactive, one is bound to be passive. Whichever department falls into a passive position, the work of that department will become more difficult.
    The fact that some agricultural cooperatives cannot find avenues for expanded reproduction with their public accumulation is a temporary phenomenon in the course of progress. With the development of industrial production, this phenomenon will gradually disappear. At present, the agricultural cooperatives' funds are not absolutely without a way out. For example, they can be deposited in banks, which in effect is also investing in the country's economic construction, and at the same time can prevent any unforeseen and irresistible natural disasters. It is also possible to concentrate the surplus funds of agricultural cooperatives to set up some local industries by special districts or counties (such as small chemical fertilizer factories by special districts, and agricultural implement and machinery factories by counties, etc.). These practices are closely related to the expanded reproduction of agricultural cooperatives. To do this well, the only question is whether the leadership is proactively planning and organizing, and whether the relevant parties are actively cooperating and supporting.

    河北黄骅县互助农业社两年生产大跃进，农业社的公共积累显著地增多了，社员的收入也大大增加了。这个农业社去年的公共积累和社员投资除用于生产和基本建设等项开支外，还有二十八万多元，感到无处使用。今年，全社预计可以再积累四十多万元。社员现有的收入，除了置买日常生活用品、盖房和向社里投资以外，手中也还有余钱十三万元以上。今年的收入还会更多。像这样的农业社，目前虽然还不是很多，但是，随着生产的跃进，一定会越来越多。这就发生了一些值得注意的新问题。
    这是一个信号，它的闪光说明农业的骏马正在飞腾奔驰，“一马当先”，要求其他部门奋起直追。农业社的雄厚的资金需要找到扩大再生产的门路，这就给工业、商业、文化教育、科学研究等部门提出了一系列的问题：农业社需要用这笔资金购买农业机械，以便用来代替繁重的体力劳动，工业部门将如何满足这种需要呢？随着农业机械的下乡，技术指导和机械的修配力量够不够呢？农村对文化生活的要求日益增长，文化教育部门有没有适应这种情况的规划和行动？农村所需用的生产资料、生活资料的需要量增加了，给商业和供销部门带来了繁重的购销任务。这些部门怎么办？是按照常规办事，还是迎头赶上去呢？
    在这方面，北京市各机械工厂采取了革命的办法。这些工厂原来只接受了国家所分配制造一万六千马力的农业动力机械设备；但由于农村定货单源源涌来，计划产量一增再增，结果仅在锅驼机和煤气机两项生产上就承担了五万三千马力的制造任务。一些从来没有生产过煤气机的工厂也接受了生产任务；有些非农业机械工厂也准备生产油泵、油塞等几十种目前急需的拖拉机配件。黑龙江省各有关部门为了满足农业生产发展的需要，也主动地积极地进行了很多有益的工作。这种主动精神是可以作为榜样的。不主动，势必要被动。哪个部门陷于被动地位，哪个部门的工作就会更加难办。
    一些农业社的公共积累找不到扩大再生产的门路，是一种前进中的暂时现象。随着工业生产的发展，这种现象将会逐渐消除。目前，农业社的资金也不是绝对没有出路的。例如可以存入银行，实际上这也就是投入了国家的经济建设，同时也可以防备万一遭到难以抗御的灾荒。也可以把农业社节余的资金集中起来，以专区或县为单位兴办一些地方工业（例如以专区为单位的小型化学肥料工厂，以县为单位的农具农械工厂之类），这些作法是同农业社扩大再生产息息相关的。要办好这件事，问题只在于：领导方面是不是主动地筹划和组织，有关方面是不是积极地配合和支持。
