　　“Bloody Sunday” is a historical painting depicting a bloody event that occurred in St. Petersburg on January 9, 1905. At that time, starving workers brought their families to the Tsar’s Winter Palace to petition. They were unarmed, singing hymns as they marched, with more than 140,000 people gathered in the streets. Nicholas II ordered the shooting of the petitioning workers. On that day, more than a thousand workers were killed by the Tsar’s army, and more than two thousand workers were injured. The streets of St. Petersburg were stained with the blood of the workers. The opening of the Soviet film "Prelude to Revolution," which was recently screened, also depicts this scene.

    “血的星期日”是一幅历史题材画，它描绘了1905年1月9日在彼得堡发生的一次流血事件。当时饥饿的工人们带着全家人到沙皇的冬宫去请愿，他们手无寸铁，唱着祷歌前进，街道上聚集有十四万多人。尼古拉第二下令枪杀游行请愿的工人，这一天有一千多工人被沙皇军队击毙，有两千多工人受伤，彼得堡的街上染遍了工人的鲜血。不久前放映的苏联影片“革命的前奏”的开头也描写了这一场面。
