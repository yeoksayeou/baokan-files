Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, and General Su Yu, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nam Il, visited the Pyongyang Textile Factory at noon today.

This textile factory, which has 60,000 spindles and more than 2,000 looms, is the largest textile factory in Korea and was expanded with the help of the Soviet Union after the victory of the Korean War.

The Chinese guests were greeted by thousands of workers lining the streets upon their arrival at the factory. The Chinese guests' cars slowly advanced in a river of friendship composed of colorful flags and bouquets. Upon reaching the central area of the factory, a moving scene unfolded. Here, thousands of male and female workers gathered, and thunderous applause and cheers of "Long live!" resounded through the sky. Nine ribbons made of the national flags of the two countries stretched from the top of the factory building to the ground in the distance, resembling a rainbow against the azure sky.

It was here that the director of the textile factory, Xu Shun, delivered a speech to welcome the distinguished guests. He said that in the struggle to build socialism and peacefully unify the motherland, they deeply felt the strength of the friendship between the people of Korea and China at all times and were willing to work hard to further consolidate this friendship.

He said that their factory had not only received thousands of tons of cotton from China, but also accepted material and technical assistance. Nearly two hundred technicians from this factory have returned from internships in China.

He said that their factory overfulfilled its production task by 109.9% last year. They are now launching a vigorous production increase campaign to achieve brilliant achievements this year. Your visit at this time will further encourage us to move towards new victories.

After a long period of applause and cheers subsided, Premier Zhou Enlai began to speak, expressing his deep gratitude to all the workers of the textile factory. He said: "From yesterday to today, we have seen that the democratic capital of Korea, the heroic city of Pyongyang, has restored its ancient and youthful beauty. We celebrate every achievement you have made in recovery and construction. We regard your achievements as our own." He said, "We are as happy to see your textile factory as we are to see our own textile factory in Beijing. This is not accidental, because the people of China and Korea have often fought side by side in the past. In the years of fighting against Japanese imperialism, we fought together; in the fight against American imperialism, we fought side by side again. Let us pass on this friendship from generation to generation, eternally and forever!"

Premier Zhou said: "As Comrade Director has just mentioned, you overfulfilled your production plan last year. We wish you greater achievements and greater victories in future production on the basis of last year."

Premier Zhou finally said: "Let the people of China and Korea unite more closely in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and learn from each other and support each other better. Let us always fight together to defend peace in the Far East and defend world peace."

The workers responded with enthusiastic applause to almost every sentence of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech. At the end of Premier Zhou's speech, the workers repeatedly shouted "Long live!" "Long live!"

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung, began to visit the factory. From one workshop to another, there were crowds of people lining the streets to welcome them. On the walls of the production workshops, there were welcoming slogans everywhere. Many spinning machines and looms were adorned with the national flags of the two countries. Workers who were working hard welcomed the Chinese guests with smiles. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi often stopped to shake hands with the workers, asking them about the production situation and wishing them greater victories in production. Premier Kim Il-sung also introduced some Korean technicians who had returned from internships in Shanghai, China, to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi.

The Chinese guests visited the factory for about two hours. When Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage finished their visit and walked out of the factory, the workers danced graceful Korean folk dances and shouted slogans to bid them farewell.

    周总理参观平壤纺织厂时对朝鲜职工说
    我们把你们的成就看成自己的成就
    新华社平壤15日电　周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长、张闻天副部长和粟裕大将在金日成首相、南日副首相兼外务相的陪同下，今天中午参观了平壤纺织厂。
    这个拥有六万纱锭和两千多台织布机的纺织厂，是在朝鲜战争胜利后由苏联帮助扩建的朝鲜最大的纺织工厂。
    中国客人们到达这个工厂的时候受到了几千名职工的夹道欢迎。中国客人们的汽车在彩旗和花束组成的友谊彩河里徐徐前进。到了工厂中心区，出现了一个激动人心的场面。这里，聚集着上千的男女职工，春雷般的掌声和“万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄。九条由两国国旗结成的彩带从工厂大楼顶上伸延到远方的地面，在蔚蓝色天空的衬托下宛如彩虹。
    就在这里，纺织厂厂长许顺致词欢迎贵宾。他说，我们在建设社会主义和和平统一祖国的斗争中，时时刻刻都深切地体会到朝中两国人民之间结成的友谊的力量是多么伟大，并且愿意为进一步巩固这种友谊而努力。
    他说，他们的工厂不仅从中国得到了数以千吨计的棉花，还接受了物质和技术方面的援助。这个工厂有将近二百名技工是从中国实习回来的。
    他说，他们的工厂去年超额完成了生产任务的109.9％。现在正在为今年取得光辉的成就展开轰轰烈烈的增产运动。正在这个时候，你们的光临将更加鼓舞我们走向新的胜利。
    在长时间的掌声和欢呼声平息以后，周恩来总理开始讲话，他向这个纺织厂的全体职工表示深深的感谢。他说：“我们从昨天到今天，看到朝鲜的民主首都、英雄的平壤市已经恢复了它古老而又年轻美丽的面貌。我们庆祝你们在恢复和建设中取得的每一个成就。我们把你们的成就看成是我们自己的成就。”他说，“我们看到你们的纺织厂就像在北京看到我们自己的纺织厂一样的高兴，这不是偶然的，因为中朝两国人民在过去常常在一起并肩战斗。在反对日本帝国主义的年代里，我们在一起进行着战斗；在反对美帝国主义的时候，我们又在一起并肩战斗过。让我们把这种友谊世世代代地传下去，永恒不变千古长存！”
    周总理说：“如同刚才厂长同志所谈到的，你们在去年超额完成了生产计划。我们预祝你们在去年的基础上，在今后的生产中取得更大的成绩，更大的胜利。”
    周总理最后说：“让中朝两国人民更紧密地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里，更好地互相学习，互相支援。让我们永远战斗在一起，保卫远东和平，保卫世界和平。”
    职工们几乎对周恩来总理的每一句话都报以热烈的掌声。在周总理讲话结束的时候，职工们连连高呼“万岁！”“万岁！”
    随后，周恩来总理一行由金日成首相陪同，开始参观这个工厂。从这个车间到那个车间，到处是夹道欢迎的人群。生产车间的墙上，处处是欢迎标语。许多纺纱机和织布机上都插着两国的国旗。正在紧张生产的工人们含笑欢迎中国客人。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理常常停下来同工人们握手，问她们生产的情况，祝她们在生产上取得更大的胜利。金日成首相还介绍了一些在中国上海实习归来的朝鲜技工同周恩来总理和陈毅副总理认识。
    中国客人们在这个工厂里参观了大约两小时。当周恩来总理一行参观结束走出工厂的时候，职工们跳着优美的朝鲜民族舞蹈，高声欢呼口号向他们告别。
