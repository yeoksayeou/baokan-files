　　No Wind, Smoke and Flame Rise Straight
　　Wu Qiying
    No wind, smoke and flame rise straight,
    With moon, bamboo shadows are cold.
    This is a couplet written by Liu Shaoyi of the Song Dynasty when he was eleven years old. Young Liu Shaoyi already wrote very well. Some people didn't believe that he had such talent at such a young age, so they proposed several first lines in person, asking him to immediately respond with the second line. For example, when the first line was "The sun moves, bamboo shadows encroach upon the chess game," he responded with "The wind sends floral fragrance into the wine cup"; when the first line was "Once thirsty for wine, I think of swallowing the sea," he responded with "Several times in poetic madness, I wanted to ascend to the sky," and so on.
    The opening couplet is one of them. Now we plan to discuss whether the phenomenon described in this couplet is in line with scientific principles.
    Whether the smoke and flame come out of the chimney, or are emitted from burning objects, we want it to rise straight up. It is easy to understand that there must be no wind. But it is not enough to just have no wind, there must also be a relatively high "air pressure". If the air pressure is low, even if there is no wind at all, the smoke and flame will not rise straight.
    What is air pressure?
    Air pressure is the pressure of the atmosphere. All the air surrounding the Earth's surface is called the atmosphere. Air has weight, and its molecules are constantly moving, so the atmosphere has pressure. Normal air pressure is about one kilogram per square centimeter. The surface of an ordinary matchbox is subjected to about sixteen kilograms of air pressure. However, the matchbox is subjected to air pressure on all sides, which are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, thus canceling each other out, so we can still pick it up easily.
    Air pressure is constantly changing. Generally speaking, air pressure is higher on cold days and lower on hot days; air pressure is higher on flat ground and lower on high mountains; air pressure is higher on sunny days and lower on rainy days. There is an instrument called a barometer that can measure air pressure. From the change in the barometer value, we can know the change in the terrain and the change in the weather.
    Why can't smoke and flame rise straight when the air pressure is low? This can be explained by an analogy:
    A solid glass ball, placed underwater, will not float up; if placed under mercury, it will float up quickly. This is because the glass ball is heavier than the same volume of water, but lighter than the same volume of mercury. Heavy objects sink, and light objects float. The weight of smoke and flame is constant, like a glass ball. Smoke and flame in low air pressure are like glass balls in water, sinking to the bottom; smoke and flame in high air pressure are like glass balls in mercury, floating upwards.
    A stove should be equipped with a chimney. Inside the chimney is hot smoke and flame, and the pressure of the hot gas is low. Around the chimney is cold air, and the pressure of the cold gas is high. The air will quickly flow from high pressure to low pressure. This is an artificial method of creating a difference in air pressure. Therefore, the function of the chimney is not only to lead the smoke out, but more importantly to lead the smoke out "quickly".
    Because the northwest wind often blows in winter, the exit of the chimney must face southeast, or due east, or due south, to prevent the northwest wind from blowing the smoke back into the chimney. But when the south wind blows occasionally, the smoke is not easy to escape from the chimney, so people often say: "South wind reverses the smoke."
    There is often airflow along the roof, so the exit of the chimney should be higher than the roof. If the exit of the chimney is lower than the roof, or under the eaves, the smoke will be difficult to rise straight up.
    In summary: Whether smoke and flame can rise straight is related to air pressure in addition to wind, so it is not comprehensive enough to say only "No wind, smoke and flame rise straight".
    As for Liu Shaoyi's second line, it is very consistent with the facts. The Earth's surface is exposed to sunlight during the day and absorbs heat. At night, it must dissipate heat. If the weather is clear, the heat will dissipate quickly. If there are many clouds in the sky, hindering the Earth's heat dissipation, the temperature will not drop too much at night.
    There is a Tang poem:
    The evening clouds recede, making it even clearer and colder,
    The Milky Way is silent, turning the jade plate;
    This life, this night is not always good,
    Where will we see the bright moon next year!
    From this poem, we can also see that on a clear night, the moon and stars are sparse, and the weather is especially clear and cold, which is the same meaning as "With moon, bamboo shadows are cold".

### 无风烟焰直

　　无风烟焰直
　　吴其英
    无风烟焰直，
    有月竹阴寒。
    这是宋朝刘少逸在十一岁的时候所作的对联。幼年的刘少逸，文章已写得很好，有人不相信他小小年纪有这样的才华，当面拟了好几个上联，叫他立刻对出下联来。例如上联为“日移竹影侵棋局”，他就对“风送花香入酒卮”；上联为“一回酒渴思吞海”，他就对“几度诗狂欲上天”，等等。
    开头的那副对联，也是其中之一，现在我们打算来讨论一下这副对联所描述的现象是否合乎科学道理。
    烟焰不论从烟囱里冒出来的，或者从燃烧着的物体散出来的，希望它笔直上升，一定要不刮风，这是容易理解的。但是光不刮风还不够，还必须有比较高的“气压”，如果气压低了，即使一点没有风，烟焰也不会直升。
    什么叫做气压呢？
    气压就是大气的压力。包围在地球表面上的全部空气，叫做大气。空气有重量，并且它的分子不停地在运动着，所以大气有压力。正常的气压大约每一平方厘米的面积上有一公斤多一些。一个普通火柴盒的表面就受有约十六公斤的气压。不过火柴盒四周都受有气压，它们的大小相等、方向相反，因此互相抵消，所以我们拿起仍很轻便。
    气压是常常变化的。一般说来，冷天的气压比较高，热天的气压比较低；平地上的气压比较高，高山上的气压比较低；晴天的气压比较高，雨天的气压比较低。有一种仪器叫做气压计，可以测量气压。从气压数值的变化中，可以知道地势高低的变化，也可以知道天气晴雨的变化。
    为什么在低气压的时候，烟焰不能直升呢？这可以用一个比方来解释：
    一个实心的玻璃球，放置在水底下，它就浮不上来；如果放置在水银底下，它就很快地浮上来了。这是因为玻璃球比同样体积的水要重，而比同样体积的水银要轻。重则下沉，轻则上浮。烟焰的重量是不变的，好比是玻璃球。低气压里的烟焰，好比是水里的玻璃球，沉在下面；高气压里的烟焰，好比是水银里的玻璃球，就会浮向上面。
    炉子应当装烟囱，烟囱里面是热腾腾的烟焰，热气体的压力低；烟囱四周是冷冰冰的空气，冷气体的压力高。气流会很快地从高压流向低压。这是用人工的方法，使气压有高低之差。因此，烟囱的作用，不光是引烟外出，更重要的是“迅速地”引烟外出。
    因为冬季常刮西北风，所以烟囱的出口，一定向东南，或者向正东，或者向正南，以免西北风把烟倒吹进烟囱里去。但是偶然刮起南风来，烟就不容易从烟囱跑出，所以人们常说：“南风倒烟”。
    沿着屋顶常常有气流流动，故烟囱的出口，应当高于屋顶。如果烟囱的出口低于屋顶，或在屋檐下，烟就很难青云直上。
    总起来讲：烟焰能不能直升，除了与风有关外，还跟气压有关，所以光说“无风烟焰直”，意义是不够周全的。
    至于刘少逸的下联倒很合乎事实。地球的表面，白天受阳光照射，吸收到的热量，在夜里就要发散，如果天气晴朗，热就散得很快。如果空中多云，阻碍了地球的散热，晚上温度就不会降低太多。
    有一首唐诗是：
    暮云收尽益清寒，
    银汉无声转玉盘；
    此生此夜不常好，
    明月明年何处看！
    这首诗里，也可以看出夜晚放晴，月明星稀，天气就益觉清寒，跟“有月竹阴寒”的意思相同。
