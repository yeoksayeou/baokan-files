Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: According to reports compiled by this newspaper, Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution ordered the arrest of four insurgent elements, including Husein, Lubis, Djambek, and Simbolon, throughout the country on the evening of the 12th.

In his order, Nasution pointed out that ample evidence obtained by the Army leadership proved that Husein and the other three conspirators were guilty of attempting to assassinate the Head of State and conspiring to change the national system by force, and therefore they must be arrested and detained for prosecution by the court.

The Army Chief of Staff issued this order based on a decision by the Cabinet. The Indonesian Cabinet decided on the 11th that the Central Sumatra Defense Region Command should cease its activities from the 12th, and that the battalion commanders and all military institutions in this region should directly obey the orders of the Army Chief of Staff. The Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff announced on the 12th that the airspace over Padang, Rengat, and Pekanbaru in Central Sumatra would be a restricted zone from that day on. Air and other transportation links between Central Sumatra and the outside world have been cut off from the 12th. The Jakarta Central Telegraph Office has stopped telecommunications with Central Sumatra. Central Sumatra is currently occupied by insurgent elements Husein and his accomplices.

The spokesman for the Indonesian Army Chief of Staff said on the 12th that Lieutenant Colonel Sumual, the former commander of the 7th Military Region, who is currently performing a so-called "certain mission" abroad, is accused of being involved in the Maluku coup that occurred in December last year. The Army Chief of Staff has ordered Sumual, through the military attachés of the embassies in Manila, Singapore, and Bangkok, to return to Jakarta by the 25th of this month at the latest, and to report to the Army Chief of Staff on the above-mentioned incident and his unauthorized travel abroad.

Sumual declared military secession in Sulawesi in March last year. After the Army authorities dealt with his actions, he went to North Sulawesi and unilaterally announced the establishment of a provincial government. Recently, he went abroad to Japan and other places to engage in conspiratorial activities. The Indonesian government's measures to suppress the insurgent elements have received enthusiastic support from the people.

The Sumatra People's Delegation told the Army leaders on the 12th that they support all the efforts made by the government and the Army leadership to resolve local disturbances.

The General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, called on the people in Kalimantan on the 12th to help the government overcome the current difficulties and to overthrow the insurgent elements in Central Sumatra.

Aidit said that Husein and his accomplices' "ultimatum" to the government suits the taste of the Dutch colonialists, and issuing this "ultimatum" is executing the conspiracy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He said that if a clear and resolute attitude is not taken towards the insurgent elements, and their conspiracy is allowed to succeed, then the Indonesian people will fall under the colonial rule of the collusion between the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Netherlands.

Aidit said that the expulsion of the four insurgent officers from the military shows that the cabinet has taken resolute measures against them. Aidit pointed out that as long as the government consistently takes a resolute attitude, and as long as the people and the army strengthen their unity, the conspiracy of the insurgent elements will not succeed.

    印度尼西亚政府封锁中苏门答腊地区
    下令通缉侯赛尼等叛逆分子
    艾地号召人民帮助政府克服目前困难
    本报综合报道　据新华社雅加达电：印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安12日晚间下令在全国各地逮捕侯赛尼、卢比斯、贾姆贝克、西姆波朗等四名叛逆分子。
    纳苏蒂安在命令中指出，陆军领导机构所获得的充分证据证明，侯赛尼和其他三名阴谋分子犯有企图暗杀国家元首并且阴谋以武力改变国家体制的罪行，因此必须逮捕和拘押他们，以便由法院起诉。
    陆军参谋长是根据内阁的决定发布这项命令的。印度尼西亚内阁在11日曾经决定，中苏门答腊防区司令部应该从12日起停止活动，同时这个地区的各营营长和一切军事机构应当直接听从陆军参谋长的命令。印度尼西亚空军参谋长在12日宣布，从当天起，中苏门答腊的巴东、林卡特和北干巴鲁等地区的上空是封锁区。印度尼西亚中苏门答腊同外界的空中和其他方面的交通联络从12日起已经被切断。雅加达中央电报局已经停止同中苏门答腊的电讯联系。中苏门答腊目前为叛乱分子侯赛尼和他的同谋者所窃据。
    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长的发言人在12日说，目前正在外国执行所谓“某种任务”的前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔中校被控同去年12月发生的马鲁古政变有关。陆军参谋长已经通过驻马尼拉、新加坡和曼谷使馆的军事武官命令苏穆阿尔至迟在本月25日回到雅加达，并且就上述事件和他这次擅自到国外旅行的问题向陆军参谋长作出报告。
    苏穆阿尔曾经在去年3月间在苏拉威西宣布实行军事割据，在陆军当局对他的行动进行处理以后，他又到北苏拉威西去擅自宣告成立省政府。最近他又出国到日本等地进行阴谋活动。印度尼西亚政府镇压叛乱分子的措施，得到人民的热烈支持。
    苏门答腊人民代表团在12日向陆军领袖表示，他们支持政府和陆军领导方面为解决地方骚乱所作出的一切努力。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地12日在加里曼丹号召人民帮助政府克服目前的困难，打倒中苏门答腊的叛乱分子。
    艾地说，侯赛尼和他的同伙给政府的“最后通牒”正合荷兰殖民主义者的口味，发出这个“最后通牒”正是在执行东南亚条约组织的阴谋。他说，如果不对叛乱分子采取毫不含糊的坚决态度，让他们的阴谋得逞，那么，印度尼西亚人民就会落在东南亚条约组织同荷兰的互相勾结的殖民主义统治之下。
    艾地说，开除四个叛乱军官的军籍这件事表明内阁已经对他们采取坚决的措施。艾地指出，只要政府始终一贯地采取坚决的态度，只要人民和军队加强团结，叛乱分子的阴谋就不会得逞。
