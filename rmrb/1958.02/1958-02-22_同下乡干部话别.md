A large number of cadres with intellectual backgrounds going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and engage in labor training is an important component of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and also an important measure to implement the Party's cadre work line. This matter has profound and far-reaching historical significance. Therefore, the comrades who go down first must be determined, work hard, persevere to the end, set a good example, accumulate experience, and truly play a leading role. Here, I would like to offer a few suggestions for the comrades going to the countryside for reference.

(1) Resolutely obey the leadership of the local Party organizations, governments, and cooperatives, respect cadres at all levels, and exemplarily abide by national laws and cooperative regulations.

Our Party is a unified organization of the whole country, organized according to the principle of democratic centralism. Party organizations at all levels implement a system combining centralized leadership and individual responsibility. Locally, the Party's local organizations are responsible for grasping the Party's policies, implementing the Party's resolutions and instructions, leading local work, and managing Party life. Our dispatched Party cadres, no matter how high their position or rank, must absolutely obey the leadership of the local Party organizations, conscientiously implement the Party's decisions, actively complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party, and must not be special in any way. We hope that non-Party cadres can also obey the leadership of the local Party and government well. Whether Party members or non-Party members, engaging in agricultural production in the countryside should obey the leadership of the township government and the cooperative, and abide by national laws and cooperative regulations. The original organs should give the greatest care and support to the dispatched cadres. Some problems that need to be solved by the original organs can be carried out after obtaining the consent of the local Party organization and government. However, the leadership is unified by the local Party organization and government, and the original organs must not establish another leadership system. Certain leading figures sent by the original organs, in addition to their own labor and production, can undertake some work of contacting dispatched cadres if entrusted by the local Party organization and government, but they are also subject to the leadership of the local Party organization and government and do not themselves become an organization. Therefore, dispatched cadres should first find the production team leader, cooperative cadres, and Party branch comrades when encountering problems, and accept their leadership and respect their opinions. If major problems cannot be solved, they should report to the Party and government leading organs of the county and request their instructions.

Dispatched cadres should fully respect local cadres, including grassroots cadres. It must be recognized that local cadres have many strengths. They may not have read as many books as we have, but they are familiar with local conditions, have close ties with the masses of farmers, have richer knowledge of rural production struggles and class struggles than we do, and generally speaking, are better able to grasp the Party's policies for rural work. At the beginning of going to the countryside, most people are relatively respectful to local cadres because they have no experience in rural life and do not understand many things, and cannot help but ask others for advice. However, after living in the countryside for a period of time and learning some things, a "cocky" phenomenon may occur, which requires special vigilance and prevention. Never exaggerate certain shortcomings of individual or a few local cadres, thinking that they are the problems of all local cadres, and negate their advantages and strengths. Whether or not we respect local cadres will affect our relationship with local farmers and affect our labor training. Because local cadres have grown up in rural struggles, and farmers regard them as representatives, they will regard our relationship with local cadres as our attitude towards farmers. Therefore, to learn from farmers, we must first respect local cadres and humbly learn from local cadres. From them, we will learn many valuable lessons. We must show with practical actions that dispatched cadres are truly humble and prudent people, are determined to participate in labor training, and are organized and disciplined people.

(2) Stand firm on the working-class position, observe problems with the method of class analysis, and ensure that all words and actions are conducive to socialism. The situation in today's countryside is complex, with various classes and strata, and the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism is still the main struggle at present. Class contradictions, the struggle between socialist and capitalist spontaneous tendencies, the contradiction between national interests, collective interests and individual interests, and the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, the leap forward and conservatism, are still very sharp. This contradiction and struggle are specifically manifested in the issues of cooperativization, the unified purchase and sale of grain, burdens, the comparison of urban and rural life, and the planning, scale and methods of agricultural production development. The first and most frequent problems encountered by dispatched cadres are the grain problem and the comparison of urban and rural life. People representing the interests of different classes or strata have different views and statements on these issues. We should use class viewpoints to analyze them concretely. It can be affirmed that there is enough grain in the countryside. The reason why some well-to-do middle peasants shout that there is not enough grain is to attempt to develop capitalist spontaneous forces. We must never believe the cries that there is not enough grain. Although the lives of farmers are a little worse than those of urban people, they have greatly improved compared with before liberation. The difference between the lives of urban and rural people will not completely disappear within a certain period of time. The government is now taking various measures to gradually narrow the distance between the lives of urban and rural people. For this issue, we should actively carry out correct propaganda and explanation, and more importantly, truly be diligent and thrifty in life, without extravagant and wasteful behavior, and absolutely not boast about urban life. We must make farmers feel that urban people, like them, are diligent and frugal, oppose waste, and are wholeheartedly striving to build a socialist motherland. Now, democratic debates are being carried out in rural areas everywhere, and socialist education movements are being launched. In this debate, we must stand on the side of socialism and oppose capitalist spontaneous tendencies. In order to enable us to stand firm, we should intensify our study of policies and laws related to rural work, and investigate and study the situation in rural areas, striving to make no mistakes or fewer mistakes.

(3) Make long-term plans ideologically, share life, labor, joys and sorrows, and destiny with farmers, and truly integrate with farmers in all aspects. For intellectuals going to the countryside, life is a major revolution, and we must first pass this test well. Before departure, we repeatedly emphasized enduring hardship and hard work, and now we must gradually concretize it and put it into action one by one. Whether it is clothing, food, housing, transportation, daily life, or work and rest, we should try our best to learn from farmers. Material life is like this, and cultural life must also undergo great changes. For example, we cannot read "Jean-Christophe" by lamp in the middle of the night, the opera "La Traviata" cannot be seen for the time being, and we can only handle hygiene and sanitation according to the realistic conditions in rural areas, etc. Many people will initially feel unaccustomed to this huge and drastic change in material and cultural life, but they must make themselves accustomed to it, otherwise they will not be able to take root in the countryside. Therefore, we must consciously fight against the bad habits and inferiorities of intellectuals. Farmers are very practical people, and they will first examine us from life. If we can share the joys and sorrows of life with farmers and gain their trust, things will be easier later.

In labor, we must first and foremost correct our attitude towards labor. Work according to our ability, do our best, and be diligent and conscientious without being lazy. At the beginning, do not overemphasize bearing heavy labor that our physical strength cannot bear. We can gradually increase our burden and improve our quality in the process of labor training. Moreover, we must persevere to the end from beginning to end, and do not slack off or retreat halfway. Farmers understand that intellectuals are physically weak, and they want to see whether we are willing to work and willing to learn. According to comrades who went to the countryside earlier, the difficulty lies in the first half month to a month. If we grit our teeth and get through this period, we will be more accustomed to physical labor. It is precisely in the initial period that we must have a particularly persevering spirit. Not only should we work hard in agricultural labor, but also in daily life, we should be quick-witted and quick-handed, diligent in hands and feet; sweeping the floor, fetching water, serving rice, washing dishes, doing what we can, and changing the habit of some people who "open their mouths for food and reach out for clothes."

We must share joys and sorrows and destiny with farmers, worry about what farmers worry about, and be happy about what farmers are happy about. Therefore, we must eat, live, and work with farmers, and live with them frequently. We must consult with them when encountering problems, and truly integrate with them in thoughts and feelings. Do not let intellectual cadres gather together in a group and be incompatible with farmers. We must humbly learn from farmers. Learn from their spirit and style of diligence, bravery, hardship, and simplicity, and get their help. Do not despise farmers, thinking that we can only learn labor from farmers. Dispatched intellectual cadres should unite and love each other and help each other, but more importantly, learn from farmers and do not have the superiority and special treatment of intellectuals. As long as we truly integrate with farmers and are seamlessly integrated, farmers will treat us as their own children and take care of us in every way and give us all possible help.

To do this, the key lies in making long-term plans ideologically and resolving to settle down and establish a career in the countryside, taking the cooperative as our home. With this determination, we can develop feelings for the countryside, love the cooperative as our home, regard farmers as close partners, and regard living and working with farmers as a matter of course, so as to have a good relationship with them. Although many cadres are of a rotational labor training nature, we must prevent and overcome the idea of being a guest, and not be in the countryside but in the city. With the idea of being a guest and not being at ease in the countryside, we will not truly work hard, and we will inevitably maintain a great distance from farmers in life, thoughts and feelings. And farmers and local cadres will inevitably regard us as special people and treat us as guests. As a result, we will be isolated from the masses and cannot truly get exercise.

(4) Respect farmers' customs and habits. This is very important for maintaining good relations with farmers. As the Chinese saying goes, "When entering a country, ask about customs" and "When entering a country, follow customs," we should practice it ourselves. If we do not understand and respect farmers' customs and habits, we may cause farmers to be unhappy as soon as we enter the door. Some customs and habits of farmers in some places have certain superstitious elements, such as sweeping the floor only from the door to the inside, and not being able to shovel the bottom of the pot when serving rice, etc. These customs and habits do not hinder socialist construction and are already popular among the masses, so we should also respect and take care of them, and not try to change them arbitrarily. The level of awareness of the masses can only be gradually improved, and we must contact the masses in order to improve the masses. Naturally, superstitious activities such as praying to gods and worshiping Buddha for holy water, which hinder production and are not conducive to socialist construction, should not be participated in. Not only should we respect the customs and habits of the masses, but we should also carefully examine some of our own lifestyles, which we are accustomed to, but which are taboo and unaccustomed to by the masses of farmers. For customs and habits, we should look, ask, and consult more, and quickly clarify all the things that need attention.

(5) Be good at learning in rural life, labor, and struggle. Agricultural production and rural work are a major subject, containing thousands of years of experience from our ancestors and decades of experience from our Party, which is worth learning a lot. Some comrades worry that living in the countryside will affect their political theory study and hinder their progress. This concern is unnecessary. In fact, participating in labor training in the countryside is the best kind of political theory study. If we can pay attention to investigating and studying the things around us, we will definitely learn a lot and make ourselves improve a step in political theory. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work": "What is knowledge? Since the existence of class society, there are only two subjects of knowledge in the world, one is called the knowledge of the struggle for production, and the other is called the knowledge of the class struggle. Natural science and social science are the crystallization of these two subjects of knowledge, and philosophy is the generalization and summary of natural knowledge and social knowledge. What other knowledge is there? There is none. Let's take a look at some students now, take a look at the students who come from schools that are completely divorced from practical social activities, what is their situation? A person reads from that kind of primary school to that kind of university, and graduates, and is considered to have knowledge. But what he has is only knowledge from books, and he has not participated in any practical activities, and he has not applied the knowledge he has learned to any department of life. Can such a person be regarded as a complete intellectual? I think it is difficult, because his knowledge is not complete." He also said: "What is the way to turn this kind of person who only has book knowledge into a veritable intellectual? The only way is to make them participate in practical work and become practical workers, and to make those who engage in theoretical work study important practical problems." Cadres who go to the countryside to participate in labor training can learn both the knowledge of the struggle for production and the knowledge of the class struggle. Isn't this the best kind of political theory study? It is a narrow and one-sided idea to think that only book knowledge is knowledge, and that knowledge can only be learned by reading, attending meetings, and listening to reports. Of course, when we arrive in the countryside, we cannot just bury ourselves in production and not ask about politics. We should read necessary books and newspapers, and get closer to the masses, ask more about the affairs of the cooperative, participate in debates more, and always pay attention to our own ideological transformation.

Some comrades also worry that they cannot learn professional and technical knowledge in the countryside, so their business will be neglected, affecting their future. It is undeniable that the study of professional and technical knowledge will be affected to some extent within a certain period of time. However, our task is to cultivate ourselves into intellectuals who are both red and expert. During the period of living in the countryside, we must first seize the opportunity to become red. After becoming red, professional and technical knowledge can be quickly made up in the future. Taking cultural work as an example, the fundamental policy task is to serve workers, peasants and soldiers, and to serve socialism. Farmers account for more than 500 million people, and agriculture is related to all aspects of China's socialist construction. If a cultural worker is not familiar with farmers and does not understand agricultural production and rural work, then even if he has certain professional skills, it is difficult to do his work completely. At the same time, in the countryside, we can also use the spare time of agricultural labor to carry out a certain degree of professional and technical practice. The problem lies in obtaining the understanding of farmers and not hindering labor training. At the beginning of going to the countryside, we should first focus on agricultural labor and not practice professional and technical skills too early, diverting our energy.

We devote ourselves to the agricultural production front with great revolutionary ideals and revolutionary enthusiasm to participate in labor training. This is a noble revolutionary action. This revolutionary ideal and revolutionary enthusiasm are very precious. Without this revolutionary ideal and revolutionary enthusiasm, nothing can be done. However, at the same time, we must face reality and combine ideals and enthusiasm with reality, and quickly turn our ideals and enthusiasm into practical life actions. It should be admitted that it is a big revolution for intellectuals to go to the countryside to participate in labor training, and it will surely cause great shocks and changes in the body, and there will be many difficulties. Many comrades have undergone a lot of ideological struggles and made some mental preparations when signing up and after signing up. However, when they gradually approach and contact reality, they may find that the mental preparation is insufficient, then they need to continue to conduct ideological work on themselves, and comrades also need to constantly conduct patient ideological mutual assistance in order to jointly and smoothly overcome this hurdle of the socialist revolution.

Ideological preparation should be sufficient, the more sufficient the better, that is, to fully consider the hardship and difficulties. If they are fully considered, after participating in labor production in the countryside, they will feel that the difficulties are nothing more than that, and they will be relaxed and happy. If they are not fully considered, when they come into contact with reality, they will feel unsatisfactory everywhere. In fact, today we are going to the countryside for labor training in a peaceful environment, which is much better and less difficult than the Long March of the Red Army, and the intellectuals going to the countryside to take up arms and fight guerrillas and carry out land reform during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. A comrade who went to the countryside said well: "As long as you think about it, our ancestors have all lived in the countryside, and today more than 500 million farmers are living in the countryside. Why can they live in the countryside, but we cannot?" We should indeed have this heroic spirit of regarding difficulties as nothing.

Any difficulty can be overcome. The important issue lies in one's own determination, ambition, and perseverance. "A thousand difficulties, one determination." With strong determination, ambition, and perseverance, wholeheartedly struggling for the construction of a socialist motherland, and paying attention to relying on the leadership of the Party, closely contacting the masses, and consciously welcoming difficulties and conquering difficulties, all difficulties will bow to us. Conversely, without determination, ambition, and perseverance, preoccupied with personal gains and losses, not listening to the Party's words, and not integrating with farmers, we will be afraid and wavering when encountering difficulties, and we will inevitably fail. The workers and peasants of China are ambitious, and we intellectuals must learn from them and also have ambition. We must advance in the face of difficulties, and not retreat in the face of difficulties. "Nothing is difficult in the world, only people who are afraid of it." Overcoming the difficulties on the road of advancement and training ourselves to be loyal to the socialist and tested intellectuals of the working class, our future will be as bright and splendid as the future of the motherland.

    同下乡干部话别
    陈克寒
    大批知识分子出身的干部下乡参加农业生产，进行劳动锻炼，是目前政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的一个重要组成部分，也是贯彻执行党的干部工作路线的一项重要措施。这件事情具有重大的深远的历史意义。因此，先行下放的同志，一定要下定决心，埋头苦干，坚持到底，作好榜样，积累经验，真正起到带头作用。这里，我愿提几点意见供下乡同志参考。
    （一）坚决地服从当地的党组织、政府、合作社的领导，尊重各级地方干部，模范地遵守国家法律和合作社章程。
    我们的党是全国的统一的组织，是按照民主集中制的原则组织起来的，党的各级组织实行集中领导和个人负责相结合的制度。在地方上，党的地方组织负责掌握党的方针政策，执行党的决议指示，领导当地各种工作，管理党的生活。我们下放的党员干部，无论职位和级别多高，必须绝对服从党的地方组织的领导，认真执行党的决定，积极完成党分配给自己的任务，丝毫不能特殊化。我们希望非党干部也能很好服从地方党政的领导。无论党员和非党员，在农村从事劳动生产，都应该服从乡政府和合作社的领导，遵守国家的法律和合作社的章程。原机关对于下放干部应该给以最大的关怀和支持，有些问题需要由原机关解决的，可以在取得当地的党组织和政府同意后进行。但是，领导上由当地的党组织和政府统一，原机关决不能另外建立一个领导系统。原机关派出的某些领导骨干，除了自己劳动生产外，如果受到地方的党组织和政府的委托，可以负担一些联系下乡干部的工作，但是他们也同样地受地方的党组织和政府的领导，本身并不成为组织。所以，下乡干部遇事都应该首先找生产队长、合作社干部和党支部同志，并且接受他们的领导，尊重他们的意见。遇有重大问题不能解决的，应该报告本县的党政领导机关，请求他们的指示。
    下乡干部应该十分尊重地方干部，包括基层干部。必须认识：地方干部有许多长处，可能他们书本没有我们读得多，但是他们熟悉地方情况，同农民群众有血肉不可分的密切联系，农村的生产斗争知识和阶级斗争知识比我们丰富得多，而且一般地说，更能掌握党的农村工作的方针政策。下乡之初，多数人因为没有农村生活经验，许多事情都不懂，不能不求教别人，对于地方干部会是比较尊重的。但是，在农村生活了一个时期以后，学到了一些东西，就可能发生翘尾巴现象，需要特别警惕和防止。决不要把个别地方或少数地方干部的某些缺点，加以夸大，以为是全体地方干部的毛病，并且否定他们的优点和长处。是否尊重地方干部，将会影响到我们同当地农民的关系，影响我们的劳动锻炼。因为地方干部是由农村斗争中成长起来的，农民以他们为代表人物，他们会把我们同地方干部的关系，看作我们对农民的态度。因此，向农民学习，首先要尊重地方干部，虚心地向地方干部学习。从他们的身上，我们将学到许多宝贵的知识。我们一定要以实际行动表明：下乡干部是真正谦虚谨慎的人，是决心来参加劳动锻炼的人，是有组织性纪律性的人。
    （二）要站稳工人阶级立场，以阶级分析方法观察问题，一切言论行动必须有利于社会主义。今天的农村，情况是复杂的，存在着各种不同的阶级和阶层，资本主义同社会主义两条道路的斗争仍然是当前的主要斗争。阶级矛盾，社会主义同资本主义自发倾向的斗争，国家利益、集体利益同个人利益的矛盾，先进同落后、跃进同保守的矛盾，还是很尖锐的。这种矛盾和斗争，具体地表现于合作化问题，粮食统购统销问题，负担问题，城乡生活对比问题，农业生产发展的计划，规模和方法问题。下乡干部首先和经常会碰到的是粮食问题和城乡生活对比问题。对于这些问题，代表不同的阶级或阶层的利益的人，有着不同的看法和说法。我们应该用阶级观点具体地加以分析。可以肯定：农村的粮食是够吃的，一部分富裕中农叫喊粮食不够吃，是为了企图发展资本主义自发势力。我们决不要听信粮食不够吃的叫喊。农民的生活，虽然比起城市人民来要差一点，但是比起解放以前已经有了很大的改善。城乡人民生活的差别在一定时期内是不会完全没有的。现在政府正在采取各种措施，逐步地缩小城乡人民生活的距离。对于这个问题，应该积极地进行正确的宣传解释，更重要的是要在生活上真正做到勤俭朴素，没有奢侈浪费行为，绝对不去夸耀城市生活。我们要使农民感到：城市人民同他们一样，都在勤俭节约，反对浪费，一心一意为建设社会主义祖国而奋斗。现在，各地农村都在进行民主大辩论，展开社会主义教育运动。在这场大辩论中，我们要站在社会主义方面，反对资本主义自发倾向。为了使得我们能够站稳立场，应该加紧学习有关农村工作的政策法令，并且调查研究农村的情况，力求不犯或少犯错误。
    （三）思想上要作长期打算，同农民同生活，同劳动，同甘苦，共命运，真正在各方面同农民打成一片。知识分子下乡，在生活上是一个大革命，必须首先过好这一关。在出发以前，一再强调吃苦耐劳，现在要逐步地具体化，一件件见诸行动。无论是衣、食、住、行、起居作息，都应该尽力向农民看齐。物质生活如此，文化生活也要作很大的改变。例如，不能半宵点灯阅读
  “约翰·克利斯朵夫”，歌剧“茶花女”是暂时地看不到了，在清洁卫生方面只能根据农村的现实条件办事，等等。对于这种物质生活和文化生活的巨大而剧烈的改变，许多人起初是会感到不习惯的，但是一定要使自己习惯起来，不然就不能在农村生根。因此，要自觉地同知识分子的不良习气和劣根性进行斗争。农民是很实际的人，他们首先要从生活来考察我们。我们如果能够在生活上同农民同甘共苦，取得农民的信任，以后的事情就会好办一些。
    在劳动上，首先和主要地要端正劳动态度。量力干，尽力干，勤勤恳恳不偷懒。在开始的时候也不要过分地勉强担负自己的体力所不能胜任的重劳动，可以在劳动锻炼过程中，逐步加重担负，提高质量。并且，自始至终坚持到底，不要中途懈怠或退却。知识分子体力弱，农民是谅解的，他们要看我们的是是否肯干，肯学。据早下乡的同志说，困难在开头半个月到一个月，这段时间咬紧牙关过去，对于体力劳动就能够比较习惯。正是在开头时期，特别要有坚毅不拔的精神。不但要努力农业劳动，而且在日常生活中，也要眼敏手快，手勤腿勤；扫地、打水、盛饭、洗碗，能做就做，改变有些人“衣来伸手、饭来张口”的习惯。
    要同农民同甘苦、共命运，以农民之忧为忧，以农民之乐为乐。因此，要同农民同吃同住同劳动，同他们经常生活在一起，遇事同他们商量，真正同他们在思想感情上打成一片；不要知识分子干部自己聚成一伙，同农民格格不入。要虚心地向农民学习。学习他们的勤劳、勇敢、艰苦、朴素的精神和作风，取得他们的帮助，不要轻视农民，以为向农民只能学习劳动。下乡的知识分子干部应该团结友爱、互相帮助，但是更重要的是向农民学习，不要有知识分子的优越感和特殊化。只要我们真正同农民打成一片，融洽无间，农民就会把我们当作自己的子女，多方地体贴和关心我们，给我们以一切可能的帮助。
    要做到这样，关键在于下乡干部思想上要作长期打算，决心在农村安家立业，以社为家。有了这种决心，才能对农村发生感情，爱社如家，把农民当作亲切的伙伴，把同农民同生活、同劳动看作理所当然的事，从而同他们搞好关系。虽然有许多干部是轮流劳动锻炼性质，但一定要防止和克服作客思想，不要身在农村心在城市。有了作客思想，不安心于农村，就不会真正埋头苦干，就必然会在生活上思想感情上同农民保持很大距离。而农民和地方干部也就难免把我们看作特殊人物，当作客人对待。结果我们就会在群众中孤立起来，不能真正得到锻炼。
    （四）要尊重农民的风俗习惯。这是搞好同农民的关系的很重要的事。中国古话说的，“入境问俗”、“入境随俗”，应该身体力行。如果我们不了解和不尊重农民的风俗习惯，那末一进门就可能引起农民的不高兴。有些地方农民的某些风俗习惯，带有一定的迷信成分，例如，扫地只能由门口向里扫，盛饭不能铲锅底，等等。这些风俗习惯，并不妨碍社会主义建设，而且已经具有群众性，同样地应该尊重和照顾，而不要企图任意加以改变。群众的觉悟程度只能逐步地提高，我们要联系群众，才能提高群众。自然，那种求神拜佛讨圣水等的迷信活动，妨碍生产，不利社会主义建设，我们是不应该参加的。不但要尊重群众的风俗习惯，我们自己有些生活方式，已经习以为常，但是为农民群众所忌讳、所看不惯，就也应该小心检点。对于风俗习惯，要多看、多问、多请教，并且尽快地把各种急需注意的事情弄清楚。
    （五）要善于在农村生活、劳动、斗争中学习。农业生产和农村工作是一门大学问，包含我们祖先的几千年经验和我们党的几十年经验，值得我们大大地学习。有些同志担心在农村生活，影响自己的政治理论学习，妨碍自己的进步。这种顾虑是不必要的。其实，在农村参加劳动锻炼，就是一种最好的政治理论学习。如果我们能够注意调查研究周围的事物，一定可以学到很多东西，使自己在政治理论上提高一步。毛泽东同志在“整顿党的作风”中说：“什么是知识？自从有阶级的社会存在以来，世界上的知识只有两门，一门叫做生产斗争知识，一门叫做阶级斗争知识。自然科学、社会科学，就是这两门知识的结晶，哲学则是关于自然知识和社会知识的概括和总结。此外还有什么知识呢？没有了。我们现在看看一些学生，看看那些同社会实际活动完全脱离关系的学校里面出身的学生，他们的状况是怎么样呢？一个人从那样的小学读到那样的大学，毕业了，算有知识了。但是他有的只是书本上的知识，还没有参加任何实际活动，还没有把自己学得的知识应用到生活的任何部门里去。像这样的人是否可以算得一个完全的知识分子呢？我以为很难，因为他的知识还不完全。”他又说：“有什么办法使这种仅有书本知识的人变为名副其实的知识分子呢？唯一的办法就是使他们参加到实际工作中去，变为实际工作者，使从事理论工作的人去研究重要的实际问题。”下乡参加劳动锻炼的干部，既可学到生产斗争知识，又可学到阶级斗争知识，难道还不是一种最好的政治理论学习吗？以为只有书本知识才是知识，只有读书、开会、听报告才能学到知识，这是一种狭隘的片面的想法。当然，我们到了农村，也不能只是埋头生产，不问政治。我们应该阅读必要的书报，并且多接近群众，多过问合作社里的事情，多参加辩论，经常注意自己的思想改造。
    也有些同志担心在农村中不能学习专业技术知识，以致业务荒疏，影响自己的前途。不可否认，在一定时期内，专业技术知识的学习是要受到一些影响的。但是，我们的任务在于把自己培养成为又红又专的知识分子。在农村生活期间，首先要抓紧机会炼红。红了以后，业务技术知识将来是可以很快补习起来的。以文化工作来说，根本的方针任务是为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务。农民占了五亿多人口，农业关系中国社会主义建设的各个方面，一个文化工作者如果不熟悉农民，不了解农业生产和农村工作，那就即使有一定的专业技术，也很难完全作好自己的工作。同时，在农村中，也还可以利用农业劳动的余暇，进行一定程度的专业技术的练习。问题在于要取得农民的谅解，并且不妨碍劳动锻炼。下乡之初，应该首先抓紧农业劳动，不要太早去练习专业技术，分散自己的精力。
    我们抱着伟大的革命理想和革命热情，投入农业生产战线，参加劳动锻炼，这是一种崇高的革命行动。这种革命理想和革命热情是很可宝贵的。没有这种革命理想和革命热情，什么事情也办不了。但是，同时我们要面向实际，要把理想和热情同实际结合，并且很快地使自己的理想和热情变成实际的生活行动。应该承认：知识分子下乡参加劳动锻炼，是一个大革命，一定要在身上引起很大的震动和变化，困难将是很多的。许多同志在报名的时候和报名以后，是经过很多思想斗争，作了一些精神准备的。但是，当一步步地接近实际和接触实际的时候，他们可能发现精神准备不足，那就需要自己对自己继续进行思想工作，同志之间也需要不断地进行耐心的思想互助，以便共同顺利地渡过社会主义革命这一关。
    思想准备要充分，越充分越好，这就是把艰苦和困难打足。打足了，到农村参加劳动生产以后，感到困难不过如此，就会轻松愉快，打不足，一同实际接触，就会感到处处不如意。其实，今天我们是在和平环境中下乡劳动锻炼，比之红军二万五千里长征，比之抗日战争时期和解放战争时期知识分子下乡拿枪杆打游击、搞土改，情况要好得多，困难要少得多。有一个下乡同志说得好：“只要想一想，我们的历代祖先都是从农村中生活过来的，今天五亿多农民都在农村过日子，为什么他们能在农村过日子，我们就不能过了呢？”我们的确应该有这种把困难看成不在话下的英雄气概。
    任何的困难都是可以克服的，重要的问题在于自己的决心、志气和毅力。“千条困难，一条决心”。有了坚强的决心、志气和毅力，全心全意地为建设社会主义的祖国而奋斗，而又注意依靠党的领导，密切联系群众，自觉地去迎接困难，征服困难，一切困难都会向我们低头。反之，没有决心、志气和毅力，孜孜于个人的得失利害，不听党的话，不同农民打成一片，遇到困难就畏惧动摇，那就难免吃败仗。中国的工人农民是有志气的，我们知识分子要向他们学习，也要有志气。我们要遇难而进，不要遇难而退。“天下无难事，只怕有心人”。战胜前进道路的困难，把我们锻炼成为忠于社会主义的经得起考验的工人阶级的知识分子，我们的前途将同祖国的前途一样的无限的光明灿烂。
