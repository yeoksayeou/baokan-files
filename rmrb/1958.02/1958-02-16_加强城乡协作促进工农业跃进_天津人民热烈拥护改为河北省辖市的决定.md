    Strengthening Urban-Rural Cooperation to Promote the Great Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture
    Tianjin People Warmly Support the Decision to Change to a City Under the Jurisdiction of Hebei Province
    (Our newspaper reports) After the broad masses of people and cadres in Tianjin Municipality read in the newspapers the "Resolution of the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress on Changing the Directly Administered Municipality of Tianjin to a Municipality Under the Jurisdiction of Hebei Province," they were all overjoyed and warmly supported it. Many people, based on their own experiences, discussed the many benefits of changing Tianjin Municipality to a municipality under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province for further strengthening urban-rural cooperation and promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and unanimously expressed their determination, under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee, to rouse their revolutionary drive, strive for advancement, and redouble their efforts in production and work for the construction of Hebei Province and the acceleration of the country's socialist construction.
    In order to express the warm support of the people of Tianjin, the Tianjin Daily published an editorial on the 12th, explaining from the aspects of urban-rural relations, the deep friendship between the people of Tianjin and the people of Hebei, the mutual promotion and support of industrial and agricultural production, etc., that this decision fully conforms to the wishes of the people of Tianjin and Hebei, as well as the benefits to the country's socialist construction.
    Tianjin's industrial labor models Yan Chunhong, Wei Zhenhua, and seven others also specially wrote a letter to Hebei's agricultural labor models Geng Changsuo, Wang Yukun, Wang Guofan, and Yu Luoshan, warmly supporting the decision to change Tianjin Municipality to a municipality under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province. In their letter, they said: "In the past, although we have done a lot of work in supporting agriculture, it is still far from enough. This year, we must better发挥 the role of Tianjin's industry, face the countryside, and serve the countryside. This year, our Tianjin workers will produce more than 20,000 gas generators, and will also trial-produce 150 tractors; the production of "666" pesticides, plant hormones, chemical fertilizers, etc., will also be greatly increased. In the future, we will also send workers and technicians to the countryside to help our farmer brothers learn and master technology, and repair machines, in order to better increase agricultural production. We hope that our farmer brothers will give us more opinions and tell us your requirements for industrial products and technology going to the countryside in a timely manner. We will definitely do our best to meet your requirements."

    加强城乡协作促进工农业跃进
    天津人民热烈拥护改为河北省辖市的决定
    本报讯　天津市广大人民和干部，从报纸上看到“第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议关于将直辖市天津市改为河北省省辖市的决议”以后，无不欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护。许多人结合自己的体会，谈论着将天津市改为河北省省辖市以后，对于进一步加强城乡协作，促进工农业生产大跃进的许多好处，并一致表示决心在中共河北省委和省人民委员会的领导下，鼓起革命干劲，力争上游，为建设河北省和加速国家的社会主义建设事业而加倍努力生产，做好工作。
    为了表示天津市人民热烈拥护的心情，天津日报于12日发表了社论，从城乡关系、天津市人民和河北省人民之间的深厚情谊、工农业生产的相互促进和支援等各方面，说明这个决定完全符合天津市人民和河北省人民的愿望，以及对国家社会主义建设的好处。
    天津市的工业劳动模范阎春洪、魏振华等九人还特地写了一封信给河北省的农业劳动模范耿长锁、王玉坤、王国藩、郁洛善，热烈拥护将天津市改为河北省省辖市的决定。他们在信上说：“过去我们虽然在支援农业方面做了不少工作，但还是很不够的。今年我们要更好地发挥天津市工业的作用，面向农村，为农村服务。我们天津市工人今年要生产煤气机两万多台，还要试制出一百五十台拖拉机；“六六六”农药和植物激素、化学肥料等也要大大增产。今后我们还要派出工人和技术人员下乡去帮助农民弟兄学习掌握技术，修配机器，以便更好地增加农业生产。我们希望农民兄弟们多给我们提意见，把你们对于工业产品和技术下乡等方面的要求，及时告诉我们，我们一定尽最大的努力来满足你们的要求。”
