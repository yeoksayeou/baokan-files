    I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 state budget and the draft 1958 state budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, and the report by Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, on the current work of language reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme; and I wholeheartedly endorse them and suggest that the Congress adopt them.
    I believe that since building socialism has become today's unanimous demand and highest principle, in order to ensure that socialism is promoted unhindered and proceeds smoothly, we must fight against all anti-socialist ideas and carry out ideological remolding. The ideological remolding of intellectuals is particularly important; because in the old Chinese society, so-called "scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants," scholars were ranked first, and society valued them, so their words and deeds had a great impact on society. Among the old intellectuals, there were many good ones, but also not a few bad ones. At the same time, old intellectuals had all received feudal and bourgeois education, which is to say, a deeply rooted education in selfishness and self-interest, and most of them lived the lives of the exploiting classes, making it difficult for them to completely accept proletarian ideology. Therefore, they must be properly reformed in order not to have a reactionary effect on socialism, but to become a force that benefits socialism. Take myself as an example, I am also someone who received a deep old education. Although I have some awareness and try my best to extricate myself and wash away the old, the old ideas brought from the old society still often unconsciously reveal themselves! I think that there are certainly many people who are better than me among those who came from the old society, but there are also not a few who are like me, so I use the heart of a petty person to measure a gentleman, and I strongly advocate reforming old intellectuals as a current urgent task. If we look at the right-wing elements this time, most of them are people who received a deep old education, and they oppose the policy of reforming intellectuals, which is indeed a clear proof of turning black and white upside down and trying to oppose socialism. As for young intellectuals, most of them are progressive, but there are also a few who have been influenced by bourgeois ideas and have become obstacles to socialism, so of course we must also strengthen their ideological remolding. As the saying goes, "No one is perfect!" As long as they can change, then that's good. I hope that regardless of new or old intellectuals, they should all take this national rectification movement as an opportunity to thoroughly examine themselves, turn over a new leaf, determine socialist thought, and firmly establish a proletarian stand. I also suggest that the government strengthen the work of reforming intellectuals, make detailed plans, and promote it step by step, so that our country can complete socialist construction at an early date.

    新旧知识分子都要加强改造
    张砺生代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告和文字改革委员会吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告；并衷心拥护，建议大会予以通过。
    我认为，建设社会主义既已成为今天举国一致的要求与最高原则，为了使社会主义推行无阻，顺利进行，就必须向一切反社会主义的思想作斗争，展开思想改造。而对知识分子的思想改造，尤为重要；因为中国的旧社会所谓“士农工商”，士列为农工商之首，社会上重视他们，所以他们的一言一行对社会的影响很大。在旧知识分子中，好的固然很多，坏的亦属不少，同时，旧知识分子都受过封建教育和资产阶级教育，也就是根深蒂固的自私自利教育，而且大都过的是剥削阶级生活，难于彻底接受无产阶级思想，因此必须好好改造一番，才不致对社会主义起反动作用，而变成有利于社会主义的力量。就以我而论，也是受过旧教育很深的人，虽有所觉悟，力为超拔洗刷，但从旧社会带来的旧思想，仍常常不知不觉地流露出来！我想，一般从旧社会过来的人，比我好的固然很多，而与我同样的恐也不少，故我以小人之心度君子，极力主张以改造旧知识分子为当前急务。我们从这次右派人物中看一看，大多数是受过旧教育很深的人，而他们却反对改造知识分子的政策，这确是颠倒黑白，处心反对社会主义的明证了。至于青年知识分子，大多数是进步的，但也有少数人受了资产阶级的思想影响，成了社会主义的障碍，当然也须对他们加强思想改造。古语“人非圣贤，孰能无过！”只要能改，那就好了。我希望，无论新旧知识分子，都应在这次全民整风运动中，好好检查一番，革面洗心，确定社会主义思想，坚定无产阶级立场。并建议政府：加强知识分子的改造工作，作出详细的规划，有步骤地去推行，使我国早日完成社会主义建设。
