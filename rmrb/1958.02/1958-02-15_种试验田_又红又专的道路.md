Cultivating Experimental Plots—The Road to Being Both Red and Expert

　　Wang Shuchang, the leader of the guidance group in Gaoqiao District, Hongan County, Hubei Province, and Deng Kaizhi, the secretary of the branch of the farm township, were once "inspecting production" on the bank of a field with their shoes and socks on. A commune member cursed at them: "Waddling around like young masters! Don't collapse our field ridges!" Wang Shuchang asked him: "Who are you cursing?" The commune member said: "I'm cursing you!" Wang Shuchang told Comrade Zhang Jingtian, the deputy secretary of the county party committee who was working in the countryside at the time, about this situation. Comrade Zhang Jingtian said, "He's right to curse! This is because we didn't participate in production and lead production."

　　Yes, he's right to curse. "Waddling around like young masters" is a fair comment from the peasants on those cadres who cannot specifically lead their production and only stand by and point fingers. Now, Comrade Wang Shuchang has been affectionately called a "technician" by the farmers instead of an "inspector," because he, like many other cadres in Hongan County, personally works with technicians and experienced farmers to cultivate "experimental plots" and specifically leads production. But throughout the country, in all walks of life, from ordinary cadres to senior leading cadres, aren't there still many people who are "waddling around"?

　　Saying "waddling around" is uncomfortable and embarrassing for many of our comrades, but it is the truth. Some of our cadres only want to work in offices and don't want to go down to the grassroots, remaining high above and divorced from the masses. Some people, even when they go down to the grassroots, still don't have their hearts in it, and still put on airs and point fingers. For such cadres, the first thing to do is to get rid of the waddling bureaucratic style. If we don't get rid of the bureaucratic style, we will not be able to become close friends of the people and integrate with the people, as the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao often taught us; the masses will not truly regard us as their own people, as the organizers and leaders of their happy lives.

　　Leading cadres leaving their offices, putting down their airs, and farming the land themselves like peasants, cultivating experimental plots or experimental fields, is the most effective way to get rid of the bureaucratic style. This is a revolution in leadership style and has extremely important historical significance. Many cadres in Hongan County used to be unwilling to go to the countryside and unwilling to go to the fields, their hearts being in the city even when they were in the countryside. But in the past year, through cultivating experimental plots and a series of other measures, the atmosphere has completely changed, becoming that their hearts are in the countryside even when they are in the city, and their hearts are in the fields even when they are in the commune. That is to say, their thoughts and feelings have truly become the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and their spiritual gap with the broad masses has been eliminated. For thousands of years, in the old society, officials regarded labor as a lowly thing. We must use our actions to tell the people: labor is a glorious undertaking. Officials in the old society considered themselves superior to the laborers. We must use our actions to tell the people: we are completely the same and completely equal to the laborers.

　　Leaving the office and cultivating experimental plots is not only a change in leadership style, but also a new creation in leadership methods. Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "There are two methods that we communists must adopt in carrying out any work: one is the combination of the general and the individual, and the other is the combination of leadership and the masses." Through experiments, the leading cadres of Hongan County, through their own direct practice, create typical experiences, and use this experience to lead and promote widespread mass production movements. This solves the two major problems of combining the individual with the general and combining leadership with the masses in one fell swoop. At present, in many places, the leadership of production is generalized, lacking in-depth and specific guidance, and there is no creation and utilization of typical experiences to promote overall work. In such places, advocating that leading cadres cooperate with technicians and experienced farmers to cultivate experimental plots is of particularly great significance. We must know that only by going deep down and breaking through one point can we create and summarize concrete and vivid experiences and guide the work in general areas more effectively. Today, the scale of production is expanding, the content of production is becoming increasingly complex, and production technology needs to be constantly innovated. Empty and generalized leadership not only cannot promote production, but sometimes even hinders the development of production. To change this situation, we must actively promote the leadership methods of Hongan and other places.

　　The leading cadres of Hongan County doing their own farming of experimental plots is a very good leadership method, but its significance goes far beyond the general improvement of leadership methods. It has a more important and more fundamental significance. This is related to the direction of effort of our vast number of cadres in the new situation.

　　Many comrades in our cadre ranks have experienced the tempering of the revolutionary flames, have a relatively firm proletarian stance, are loyal to the socialist cause, and have experience in leading the masses in class struggle. They mostly bear the responsibility of leadership in various positions, continue to lead the class struggle, and at the same time lead the great socialist economic construction cause. At present, on the one hand, our people still need to continue the struggle against imperialist aggressors and counter-revolutionaries, and on the political and ideological fronts, we still need to continue to complete the socialist revolution, and we still need to finally complete the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production. These all belong to the scope of class struggle. But on the other, socialist economic construction is becoming more and more the central task of our people. We still need to make arduous efforts to build our country into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture. As time goes by, the skills in class struggle that our leading cadres are familiar with are becoming idle, and the skills in fighting against nature that we are not familiar with need to be stepped up. The leading cadres that our country urgently needs now are those who are completely loyal to the socialist cause and have sufficient professional knowledge to organize and guide socialist construction, that is to say, they need "both red and expert" leading cadres. Red is the communist ideology and politics, and expert is the specialized business and technology. Politics is the commander, the soul, and the guarantee of all business and technology. Not asking about politics will become a "practical person" who loses direction. Conversely, if you don't understand business at all, and don't have considerable technical knowledge, you will become a "empty-headed politician" and cannot practically lead and promote the cause of socialist construction. Without a strong cadre team that is both red and expert, it would be impossible to complete the socialist cause. We communists once used unremitting efforts to learn the skills of class struggle, so we defeated the powerful enemy; now, we must also use unremitting efforts to learn the skills of fighting against nature, learn to engage in economics, engage in construction, and learn the technology and knowledge required for all aspects of work, and learn from outsiders to become insiders. This is the serious historical task currently facing our Chinese communists.

　　The major principled significance of leading cadres cultivating experimental plots lies in the fact that this is the road for many of our leading cadres to become both red and expert. Cultivating experimental plots will enable the comrades who lead agricultural production to truly acquire the technology and knowledge of agricultural production, become insiders of agricultural production, and enable them to successfully lead the great leap forward in agricultural production. This road is not only the road for comrades who lead agricultural production, but also the road for all comrades who do leadership work to achieve both red and expert. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "If you want to have knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself." In our decades of revolutionary struggle, which successful thing was not personally participated in by our leading cadres? Leading class struggle requires this, and leading production struggle also requires this. Leading cadres cultivating experimental plots can not only obtain production knowledge, make leadership work more in line with actual needs, and greatly reduce the problems of subjectivism and bureaucracy, but also greatly increase the courage and confidence in increasing production. Now, the work in many regions and many departments is advancing by leaps and bounds, with a thousand miles a day. The reason is mostly because the leading cadres have begun to truly study business and can begin to effectively lead the work in business. But there are still many comrades who have not really drilled in, and are always hovering outside the door; or they have learned a little, and think that they have become insiders, and are unwilling to study further. In this way, their work progresses very slowly and always stays at the original level. If these comrades do not repent and catch up, the times will leave them far behind, and their original redness will slowly fade away.

　　In order to promote the method of cultivating experimental plots to all rural workers in the country, and further promote it to the leadership workers in all other departments, it is also necessary for comrades from all places and all aspects to make creative efforts. We hope that the leading cadres of all industrial and mining enterprises, as well as the leading cadres in transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, health and other fields, can leave their offices, go deep into the grassroots, emulate the method of cultivating experimental plots, closely combine with the working masses and technical experts, and conscientiously learn the necessary business knowledge and technical knowledge. Become proletarian experts in their own industries, so as to quickly establish a strong cadre team that is both red and expert for our party and country.

### 种试验田—又红又专的道路

    种试验田—又红又专的道路
    湖北省红安县高桥区的指导组长王树昌和农场乡支部书记邓开志，有一次穿着鞋袜在田岸上“检查生产”，一位社员对着他们大骂：“摇摇摆摆，像个相公（意即少爷），不要把我们的田埂子踩坍了！”王树昌问他：“你骂谁？”那位社员说：“我骂你！”王树昌把这个情况告诉当时下乡工作的县委副书记张景田同志，张景田同志说，“骂的对！这是因为我们没有参加生产、领导生产。”
    是的，骂的对。“摇摇摆摆，像个相公”，这是农民对那些不能具体领导他们生产、只会站在旁边指手划脚的干部的公正的评语。现在，王树昌同志已经被农民们亲热地称呼为“技术员”而不是“检查官”了，因为他和红安县的其他许多干部一样，亲自动手同技术人员和老农一道，种“试验田”，具体地领导生产了。但是，在全国各地，在各行各业，从一般干部到高级的领导干部，不是还有许多人在“摇摇摆摆”吗？
    说“摇摇摆摆”，对于我们许多同志来说是不舒服的，难堪的，但却是事实。我们有些干部，只愿在机关里办公，不愿到下层去，高高在上，脱离群众。有些人即使到了下层，但仍然人到心不到，仍然是摆架子，指手划脚。对于这样的干部，首先必须打掉摇摇摆摆的官风。不把官风打掉，我们就不可能像党中央和毛主席经常教导的那样，成为人民群众的亲密朋友，和人民群众打成一片；群众也就不会真正把我们当成自己人，当成他们建设幸福生活的组织者和领导者。
    领导干部走出办公室，放下架子，和农民一样自己动手种庄稼，种试验田或者叫做试验地，是打掉官风的最有效办法。这是领导作风上的革命，具有极其重大的历史意义。红安县的许多干部，以前曾经是不愿下乡，不愿下田，人在乡下，心在城里，而在一年以来，经过种试验田和其他一系列的措施，风气却完全改变了，变得人在城里，心在乡下，人在社里，心在田里。这就是说，他们的思想感情，真正成为劳动人民的思想感情了，他们和广大群众的精神隔阂消除了。几千年来，在旧社会中，当官的人都把劳动看成卑下的事情，我们要用自己的行动来告诉人民：劳动是光荣的事业。旧社会当官的都把自己看得比劳动者高一头，我们要用自己的行动告诉人民：我们是和劳动者完全一样、完全平等的人。
    走出办公室，种试验田，不仅是领导作风的转变，而且是领导方法的新创造。毛泽东同志曾经说过，“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”红安县领导干部通过试验，以自己的直接的实践，创造典型经验，用这个经验去领导和推动广泛的群众性的生产运动。这就一举而解决了个别与一般相结合和领导与群众相结合这两大问题。目前还有许多地方对生产的领导一般化，缺少深入的具体的指导，没有创造和利用典型经验，以推进全盘工作。在这样的地方，提倡领导干部同技术人员、有经验的农民合作种试验田，更有特别重大的意义。要知道只有深入下去，突破一点，才能创造和总结出具体的生动的经验，更有成效地指导一般地区的工作。今天，生产的规模日益扩大，生产内容日益复杂，生产技术需要步步革新。空洞的一般化的领导，不仅不能推进生产，有时候甚至会阻碍生产的发展。要改变这种情况，必须积极推广红安等地的领导方法。
    红安县领导干部自己动手种试验田，是一个很好的领导方法，但它的意义远不止于一般的领导方法的改进，它还有更重要的更根本的意义。这是关系到在新形势下我们广大干部的努力方向的问题。
    我们的干部队伍中，有许多同志曾经历了革命烽火的锻炼，有比较坚定的无产阶级立场，对社会主义事业是忠心耿耿的，也有领导群众进行阶级斗争的经验。他们大都在各个不同岗位上负担领导的责任，继续领导着阶级斗争，同时领导着伟大的社会主义经济建设事业。目前我国人民在一方面还需要继续进行反对帝国主义侵略者和反革命分子的斗争，在政治战线和思想战线上还需要继续完成社会主义革命，并且还需要最后完成生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命，这些都属于阶级斗争的范围；但是在另一方面，社会主义经济建设却愈来愈成为我国人民的中心任务。我们还需要作艰巨的奋斗，才能把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。随着时间的推移，我们的领导干部熟悉的阶级斗争的本领，有些快要闲起来了，而我们不熟悉的向自然界进行斗争的本领，则需要加紧学习。现在我们国家所急切需要的领导干部，就是完全忠实于社会主义事业而又具有充分的业务知识来组织和指导社会主义建设的人，也就是说，需要“又红又专”的领导干部。红就是共产主义的思想和政治，专就是专门的业务和技术。政治是统帅，是灵魂，是一切业务和技术的保证。不问政治，就会成为迷失方向的“实际家”。反之，如果完全不懂业务，没有相当的技术知识，也就会成为“空头政治家”，不能在实际上领导和推进社会主义建设的事业。没有一个强大的又红又专的干部队伍，就决不可能完成社会主义事业。我们共产党人曾经用坚忍不拔的努力学会了阶级斗争的本领，因此把强大的敌人打败了；现在，我们同样要用坚忍不拔的努力学会向自然界作斗争的本领，学会搞经济、搞建设，学会各方面工作所需要的技术和知识，由外行学成内行。这是我们中国共产党人目前所面对着的严重的历史性的任务。
    领导干部种试验田的重大的原则意义，在于这是我们许多领导干部走向又红又专的道路。种试验田，将使领导农业生产的同志们真正取得农业生产的技术和知识，成为农业生产的内行，使他们能够成功地领导农业生产的大跃进。这条道路，不仅是领导农业生产的同志的道路，而且也是所有做领导工作的同志达到又红又专的道路。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”在我们几十年来的革命斗争中，那一件成功的事情不是我们的领导干部亲身参加的呢？领导阶级斗争需要这样，领导生产斗争同样需要这样。领导干部种试验田，不仅可以获得生产知识，使领导工作更加切合实际需要，大大减少主观主义和官僚主义的毛病，而且可以大大提高增加生产的勇气和信心。现在有许多地区和许多部门的工作，突飞猛进，一日千里，原因多半是因为领导干部开始真正钻业务了，能够在业务上开始切实地领导工作了。但是也还有许多同志并没有真正钻进去，老是在门外徘徊；或者是稍微学得一点，就自以为已经成了内行，不愿再深入学习。这样，他们的工作就进展很慢，老是停留在原有的水平上。这些同志如果不痛切猛省，奋起直追，时代就会把他们远远抛在后面，他们原有的红色也就会慢慢淡下去。
    为了把种试验田的方法推广到全国一切农村工作者中去，并且进一步推广到其他一切部门的领导工作者中去，还需要各地方各方面的同志进行创造性的努力。我们希望所有工矿企业的领导干部，以及交通、财贸、文化、教育、卫生等方面的领导干部，都能走出办公室，深入下层，都来仿效种试验田的办法，同劳动群众和技术专家密切结合，认真学习必要的业务知识和技术知识，成为自己行业的无产阶级专家，从而为我们党和国家迅速地建立起一支强大的又红又专的干部队伍。
