“Short-Cutting Propagation” is a Good Way to Solve Tea Seedling Problems

　　Before 1956, most areas of Fujian Province used seed propagation to supply tea seedlings. Because seed production was limited and easily affected by climate, resulting in reduced production, it could not meet the needs of a large number of new tea gardens and replanting missing plants in old tea gardens. In addition, seed propagation easily loses the original variety characteristics. In 1955, the Provincial Department of Agriculture began to pay attention to the use of asexual propagation, especially in Anxi, where it was found that the method of short-cutting propagation was very good. After experiments in Zhenghe, Fuding and other places, the survival rate reached 70% to 80%, so it was widely promoted in 1956 and 1957. In the past two years, special agricultural cooperatives and state-owned tea farms have propagated by cuttings, and 100 million seedlings have survived and left the nursery, plus more than 10 million seedlings propagated by layering, which can be planted in more than 40,000 mu of tea gardens. In the past two years, the province has expanded tea gardens by more than 50,000 mu, mainly relying on seedlings propagated by cuttings for planting. In 1958, it is planned to cultivate 60,000 mu, 70% of which can be planted with seedlings propagated by cuttings, and efforts will be made to basically no longer rely on seed propagation of seedlings in the future.
　　
    “Short-Cutting Propagation” is also used in tea-producing countries such as the Soviet Union, Ceylon, India, and Japan, and is one of the methods of asexual propagation of seedlings. One-year-old branches of tea trees are cut into cuttings about one inch long, including one node and one leaf, and are best planted in the nursery in spring from the vernal equinox to the Qingming period. Generally, they can be transplanted into the seedling garden in autumn. Experience has proved that the main advantages of short-cutting propagation are: under the conditions of good nursery fertilization, irrigation, and management, the cuttings root quickly and the root system develops vigorously, which is faster than seed breeding, and can maintain the characteristics of excellent varieties. At the same time, because the cuttings are short and save materials, they can be propagated in large quantities, and can be harvested one or two years earlier than seed propagation. In spring and autumn cuttings, the use of branches is good for the mother tree, as long as the management is good, fertilization is sufficient, and the picking is reasonable, the yield can be greatly increased. At present, in the case that tea seed production cannot meet the needs of a large number of reclaimed tea gardens, this advanced method can be widely promoted.

    “短穗扦插”是解决茶树种苗的好办法
    福建省1956年以前大部地区多用种籽繁殖，供应茶树种苗，因种籽产量有限，易受气候影响而减产，远不能满足大量开辟新茶园及补植旧茶园缺株的需要，加以种籽繁殖容易失去原有品种特性，该省农业厅1955年开始注意采用无性繁殖，特别是在安溪发现用短穗扦插的办法很好，经过政和、福鼎等地试验，成活率达70％至80％，于是在1956年和1957年大量推广。两年来，特约农业社及国营茶场扦插繁殖，成活出圃的有一亿株，连同压条繁殖的一千多万株，可种植四万多亩茶园，该省两年来，共扩种茶园五万多亩。主要是依靠扦插繁殖的种苗来种植的。1958年计划垦辟六万亩，70％可采用扦插种苗栽植，并争取今后基本上不再依靠种籽繁殖种苗。
    “短穗扦插”在苏联、锡兰、印度、日本等产茶国家亦都采用，是无性繁殖种苗的方法之一。将茶树上一年生的枝条剪下长约一寸包括一节一叶的插穗，最好在春季春分至清明期内插在苗圃中，一般秋季就可出圃移植于苗园内。经验证明短穗扦插的主要优点是：在苗圃肥培、灌溉、管理较好的条件下，插条发根快、根群发育盛壮，比种子育苗来得快，并且能保持优良品种的特性，同时由于插穗短、用材省，可以大量繁殖，较种籽繁殖可提前一二年采收。在春、秋扦插采用枝条对母树来说，只要管理好、施肥足、采摘合理，就可以大大增产。在目前茶籽产量不能满足大量垦辟茶园需要的情况下，这种先进方法，可以普遍推广。
