Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 21st. Chinese People's Volunteer Army units today held widespread meetings or symposiums at the front lines and in their stationed areas, enthusiastically endorsing the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments and the decision to withdraw all Volunteer Army troops from Korea in batches before the end of 1958. They also sent a large number of letters of determination and pledges to the unit leaders and the Volunteer Army headquarters.

    When a certain Volunteer Army unit guarding the west coast held a meeting, Wang Zhanshan, a second-class combat hero of a certain first-class meritorious service company, said at the meeting: "In the past, we came for peace and fought for peace, and now we are preparing to leave for peace." Volunteer Army soldiers guarding the heroic positions of Shangganling, Ma Liang Mountain, Old Baldy Mountain, and Dingzi Mountain all expressed one after another: If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression again, then as long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, they will once again cross the Yalu River and give the aggressors an even heavier blow, just like they defended those heroic positions before.

    At a meeting to endorse the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments held by a certain Volunteer Army unit stationed in the Yichuan area, a letter of determination from all officers and soldiers was adopted, guaranteeing that "the army withdraws, but the friendship remains." After the meeting, they dispatched more than 200 officers and soldiers to help the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the stationed area transport fertilizer, and also proposed to vigorously support the agricultural cooperative in increasing production before withdrawing from Korea, contributing manpower and fertilizer. A certain anti-aircraft artillery company wrote to the Volunteer Army leaders: "During the years of war and the days after the armistice, our company received infinite care and help from the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. Now that we are about to return to our country, the Korean people's courage, diligence, love for their country, and spirit of defending peace will always remain in our hearts and become a model for us to learn from."

    过去为和平而战　现在为和平撤兵
    志愿军官兵拥护撤出朝鲜的决定
    新华社平壤21日电　中国人民志愿军各部队官兵今天在前沿阵地和驻区普遍召开的大会或座谈会上，热烈拥护中朝两国政府联合声明和关于志愿军在1958年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜的决定，并且向部队首长和志愿军总部送上了大批决心书和保证书。
    守卫在西海岸的志愿军某部队举行大会时，某一等功臣连队的二级战斗英雄王占山在会上说：“过去我们为和平而来，为和平而战，如今我们又准备为和平而去。”守卫在上甘岭、马良山、老秃山、丁字山等英雄阵地上的志愿军战士们都纷纷表示：如果美帝国主义胆敢重新发动侵略战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，他们将再一次跨过鸭绿江来，像从前保卫那些英雄阵地那样，给侵略者以更沉重的打击。
    驻伊川地区的志愿军某部在拥护中朝两国政府联合声明的大会上，通过了全体官兵的决心书，保证作到“军队撤出，友谊长存”。会后，他们就派出两百多名官兵帮助驻地中朝友谊农业社运送肥料，还提出在撤出朝鲜之前大力支援农业社增产，要人出人，要肥料给肥料。某高射炮连队上书志愿军首长说：“我们连队在战争的岁月里，在停战后的日子中，受到了朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的无限关怀和帮助，现在我们快要回国了，朝鲜人民的勇敢勤劳、热爱祖国和保卫和平的精神将永远留在我们的心中，成为我们学习的榜样。”
