Facing the sunlight, I walk through the streets and alleys.

I see children doing winter exercises. The older brother, a fifth-grader, takes his younger brother, who hasn't started school yet, out for a run early in the morning to exercise. They run along the base of the wall, and when the younger brother gets tired and out of breath, the older brother slows down.

I see many shop employees walking into a department store in groups. They have come to learn from this store. They want to bring all the advantages of this store's work back to their own units.

I see a large, pitted wasteland filled with furnace ash. In the past, those many pits were homes for mosquitoes and flies. Now, on this leveled ground, children on winter vacation are playing football, practicing racing, chasing, and laughing.

I see workers from the iron factory carrying coal unloaded beside the street back to the factory themselves. They just got off the night shift and haven't rested yet, but they automatically came to volunteer to move coal. In the past, temporary workers were hired to transport the coal.

I see groups of young people, middle-aged people, and women going to suburban agricultural cooperatives to participate in voluntary labor, to dig up pupae and eliminate flies, to learn from other units...

Facing the sunlight, I walk through the streets and alleys. Wherever I go, I see people working intensely, working with redoubled efforts, full of energy, happy and excited.

Garbage Sorting

They carefully hold the trash can, walk out of the yard, and go to the street, afraid of accidentally falling and spilling the furnace ash they have accumulated for two days; afraid that an impetuous child will run head-on and knock them down, spilling the ashes.

In their eyes, they are not dumping furnace ash, but wealth, accumulated bit by bit, the amount is considerable. This wealth is what they wholeheartedly want to dedicate to the country, and what they accumulate anytime, anywhere.

From the day they heard that furnace ash can be used to make hollow bricks, which can be used as materials for filling pits and paving roads at construction sites, and that dirty soil can fertilize fields, they stopped dumping garbage as before, and separated furnace ash and dirty soil into separate containers, dumping one type every other day.

Not only them, but also people in nearby alleys and on the streets, people all over Beijing, are doing the same thing together, every day, every month...

As a result, truckload after truckload of furnace ash is transported to construction sites and brick factories, and truckload after truckload of dirty soil is transported to agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs.

As a result, every time they dump furnace ash or dirty soil, they always stay at the garbage station for a while, watching the trucks loaded with dirty soil drive towards the suburbs, until the trucks drive far away and can no longer be seen, then they carry their empty trash cans home.

Sometimes, after dumping the dirty soil, they are attracted by the construction site opposite the garbage station. Even in the dead of winter, countless workers still work hard in the warm sheds every day, and many stonemasons still brave the severe cold to chisel stone. On this construction site, several large buildings have already grown up, some have been built with three floors, and are still being built upwards. Looking in the direction that the trucks drive towards the suburbs, countless brand-new and huge buildings have also grown up on both sides of the flat and wide street, being built higher day by day, expanding day by day, without beginning and without end...

Whether it is the construction site or the rural suburbs, they now feel that they are closely related to them.

Toys

The children are gathered together, vying to see the toy that their mother just bought from the department store: a hand-cranked movie projector.

It is green on the outside and painted with oil paint. It is very small and exquisite, only about half a foot high, and looks just like a three-dimensional rectangular iron box. But it is a movie projector, a toy, and something that children love.

In the cinema, how much the children want to see the movie projector, but they have never had the opportunity to see it. They have also never seen how movies are projected. And this movie projector brings joy to the children and helps them understand some of the things they have wanted to know for a long time.

The children only need to use one eye to align with a small viewing hole on the front of the movie projector, and then slowly crank a small wooden handle on the right side of the box with their right hand, and they can roll the old movie film in the box and clearly see the scenery and characters on the film.

This toy is a product of the toy production cooperative, and it is made by the members using waste materials.

As long as they have old canned iron drums or paint-filled iron drums in their hands, they can wash them, flatten them, cut them, weld them, and paint them to make movie projectors, small iron buckets, small iron pots, small coal briquette stoves...

They are always busy for the children.

Their products are scattered in every department store, every toy store, and in many homes with children. As soon as they see these toys, the children's tightly closed corners of their mouths smile, and their small palms reach out to their parents.

The children's lives have become richer because of good toys, they often have smiles, their laughter is more hearty, and their energy is more abundant.

Games

They are covered in dirt, their shoes are covered in dirt, and their faces are also covered in dirt. Their wide-open eyes are all black and bright. They haven't gone to school yet, they are not old enough to go to school, and they are all children under the age of seven.

They are playing games.

They are divided into two piles of sand and soil in the construction site, and using these sand and soil, they build buildings, lay railways, build gardens, dig big rivers, and build big bridges. They are building the world they imagine with their own hands.

Across the street, the building under construction by the construction workers has been built to the fourth floor. The children often stand on this side of the street, carefully observing and imitating the actions of the worker uncles. They are also carrying bricks, carrying soil, building scaffolding, and have learned some of the worker uncles' catchphrases.

They are also challenging and competing with each other. They are all striving to build their roads well and build their bridges well, while constantly supervising each other and shouting not to damage their own labor results.

They gather here every day. Their homes are scattered in the nearby streets and alleys. From the day they started digging the foundation on the other side of the street, they started gathering around the construction site and learning from the worker uncles.

They see: the worker uncles building buildings on the flat ground, burying water pipes and wires in the buildings. They feel that the worker uncles are the most capable, and they feel that they also want to be like this.

Those worker uncles who stand on the high scaffolding to build walls and plaster, and those worker uncles who mix cement and install water pipes, are their most admired teachers.

    迎着阳光（外三章）
    刘北汜
    迎着阳光，我走过大街，穿过胡同。
    我看到孩子们在做冬季锻炼。在小学读五年级的哥哥一清早就领着还没入学的小弟弟出来跑步，锻炼身体。他们顺着墙根跑，小弟弟累了，气喘了，做哥哥的就放慢步子。
    我看到，很多商店职工成群结队地走进一家百货商场去。他们是来向这个商场学习的。他们要把这个商场工作上的一切优点都带回自己的单位去。
    我看到，一个满是坑坑洼洼的大荒场用炉灰填平了。过去，那许许多多坑洼是蚊子、苍蝇的家。现在，在这个垫平了的场地上，正在度寒假的孩子在踢足球、练赛跑、追逐、嬉笑。
    我看到，铁工厂的工人自己动手把卸到街道旁的煤块担回厂里去。他们刚刚下夜班，还没有休息，就自动跑来义务搬煤了。过去，运到了煤，都是雇用临时工搬运的。
    我看到，成群结队的青年人、中年人和妇女，去郊区农业社参加义务劳动，去挖蛹灭蝇，去别的单位学习……
    迎着阳光，我走过大街和胡同。无论我走过哪里，我都看到人们紧张地工作着，加倍努力地在干着，精神焕发，愉快而又兴奋。
    垃圾分类
    她们小心翼翼地捧着垃圾箱，走出院子，走到街上，生怕不小心跌倒，打翻她们积存了两天的炉灰；生怕哪家冒失的孩子迎面奔过来，一头撞倒她们，撞翻那些炉灰。
    在她们眼里，她们倒的不是炉灰，而是财富，一点一滴积攒起来，数目就很可观了。这财富是她们一心一意要献给国家的，是她们随时随地积攒的。
    从她们听说炉灰可以用来做空心砖，供建筑工地填坑垫路的材料，而脏土可以肥田的那一天起，她们就不像先前那样倒垃圾了，就把炉灰和脏土分开来装，每隔一天倒一样了。
    不止她们，附近胡同里和大街上的人家，全北京市的人家，也都一齐这么做了，天天如此，月月如此……
    于是，一卡车一卡车的炉灰运到工地和砖厂去，一卡车一卡车的脏土运到市郊农业社去。
    于是，每次倒好炉灰或脏土，她们总要在垃圾站上停留一会儿，目送着载了脏土驶向市郊的大卡车，直到卡车驶远了，见不到了，她们才提着空垃圾箱回家去。
    有时，倒好了脏土，她们又会被垃圾站对面的建筑工地吸引住。已是深冬了，每天仍然有无数工人在暖棚里辛勤地工作，仍然有不少石工冒着严寒在凿石。这片工地上，已有好几幢大楼茁长起来，有的已砌了三层，还在继续往上砌。顺着卡车驶向市郊的方向望过去，平坦、广阔的大街两旁也已有无数崭新的巨大建筑物在茁长，逐日砌高，逐日扩展，不见头，也不见边……
    不论是工地或郊区农村，现在她们都感到和她们是息息相关的了。
    玩具
    孩子们围在一起，争着看妈妈从百货公司新买来的玩具：手摇电影机。
    它外表是绿色的，用油漆漆的。它很巧小，很玲珑，不过半尺来高，看起来只像个立体长方形的铁匣子。但它是电影机，是玩具，是孩子们喜爱的。
    在电影院里，孩子们多么希望看到电影放映机呵，他们还从来没有机会看到过。他们也从来不曾看到电影是怎样放映出来的。而这只电影机，给孩子们带来了欢乐，帮助孩子们多少了解了他们早想知道的事情。
    孩子们只要用一只眼睛对正电影机正面一只小小的了望孔，再用右手缓缓摇动匣子右侧的一只小木柄，就可以卷动匣子里的旧电影胶片，清楚地看出胶片上的风景人物了。
    这个玩具，是玩具生产合作社的产品，是社员们利用废物制成的。
    只要有旧罐头铁筒，或是盛漆的铁筒到了他们手里，他们就可以洗净、打平、裁好、焊好、漆好，做成电影机，做成小铁桶、小铁锅、小煤球炉……
    他们总是为孩子忙的。
    他们的产品散布在每个百货公司、每个售卖玩具的店铺里和很多有孩子的家里。只要一望到这些玩具，孩子们闭紧的嘴角就笑了，小小的手心就会伸向爸爸妈妈。
    孩子们的生活因为有了好玩具，变得更丰富了，经常有笑容了，笑声更爽朗，精力也更充沛了。
    游戏
    他们浑身是土，鞋上是土，脸上也是土。他们圆睁着的眼睛，一个个都是又黑又亮的。他们都还没有上学，都还不到上学年龄，都还是不满七岁的孩子。
    他们在做游戏。
    他们分踞着工地中的两堆沙土，就利用这些沙土，他们盖大楼、铺铁道、修花园、挖大河、建大桥。他们在用他们自己的双手，建造着他们想像中的天地。
    街对面，建筑工人们正在修建中的大楼已砌到第四层了。孩子们经常站在街的这一面，细心观察着、模仿着工人叔叔们的一举一动。他们也在挑砖、抬土、搭脚手架，而且学会了工人叔叔们的一些口头语。
    他们也在彼此挑战、竞赛着。都在争取自己的路筑得好，桥搭得好，同时又彼此不断监督着、呼叫着不要碰坏自己的劳动果实。
    他们天天聚在这里。他们的家就分散在附近的街道胡同中。从街对面开始挖地基的一天起，他们就开始聚在工地四周，向工人叔叔们学习了。
    他们看到：工人叔叔们在平地上盖起大楼、在大楼里埋下水管、电线。他们感到工人叔叔们是最有本事的，觉得他们自己也要这样。
    那些站在高高的脚手架上砌墙、抹灰的工人叔叔们、那些在搅拌水泥、安装水管的工人叔叔们，就是他们最最崇拜的教师。
