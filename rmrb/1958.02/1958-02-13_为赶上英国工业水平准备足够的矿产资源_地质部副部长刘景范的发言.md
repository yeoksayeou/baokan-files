I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft of the 1958 national budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft national economic plan for 1958, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current reform of the written language and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

The exploration tasks for the 19 mineral reserves stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan have been largely completed or overfulfilled, and the main mineral reserves needed for industrial construction have greatly increased.

In 1957, after the great rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, we achieved great victories on the political and ideological fronts. This victory promoted various socialist construction undertakings, and also promoted the new development of geological work. In 1957, the total amount of geological exploration work by the Ministry of Geology increased by 17% compared to 1956, and overfulfilled the 1957 target stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan by 25%. Geological work in other industrial sectors has also developed greatly. The tasks for the 19 mineral reserves stipulated in the First Five-Year National Plan (including various industrial sectors) have been completed or overfulfilled, except for chromium, oil shale, and cement limestone. In addition, 30 mineral reserves not included in the national plan have been proven. As a result of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the main mineral reserves needed for industrial construction have greatly increased. For example: Iron ore, the cumulative proven reserves by the end of 1957 were 4.554 billion tons, completing 185% of the Five-Year Plan. Together with the 145 million tons proven before the end of 1952, the total is 4.7 billion tons, ranking third in the world, after the Soviet Union and India, exceeding France and the United States (Soviet Union 35.3 billion tons, India 5.1 billion tons, France 3.9 billion tons, United States 2.95 billion tons); Coal, the cumulative proven reserves by the end of 1957 were 32.55 billion tons, completing 161% of the Five-Year Plan. Together with the 11.7 billion tons proven during the production process of producing mines, the total is 44.2 billion tons, ranking sixth in the world; Manganese ore, completed 186% of the Five-Year Plan, and the proven reserves rank second in the world, after the Soviet Union, exceeding Equatorial Africa (Equatorial Africa 50 million tons); Copper ore, completed 141% of the Five-Year Plan, and the proven reserves rank sixth in the world, after the Soviet Union, Northern Rhodesia, the United States, Chile, and the Belgian Congo, exceeding Canada (6 million tons); Lead ore, completed 167% of the Five-Year Plan, and the proven reserves rank second in the world after the Soviet Union, exceeding Australia (3.2 million tons); Tungsten ore, completed 153% of the Five-Year Plan, and the proven reserves rank second in the world after the Soviet Union, exceeding the total reserves of capitalist countries (United States 51,000 tons, South Korea 40,000 tons, other capitalist countries a total of 119,000 tons); Aluminum ore, completed 180% of the Five-Year Plan, and the proven reserves rank second in the world, greatly exceeding the United States (50 million tons), only second to the Soviet Union; Tin ore, completed 108% of the Five-Year Plan, Molybdenum ore completed 711% of the Five-Year Plan, the reserves of tin ore proven in the first five years exceeded Malaysia (780,000 tons), which has always been in the first place in the world, and the reserves of molybdenum ore exceeded the United States (700,000 tons), which has always been in the first place in the world; Oil, the reserves proven in the first five years increased by 2.4 times compared with the reserves at the end of 1952; Oil shale completed 83% of the Five-Year Plan, and the cumulative proven reserves by the end of 1957 were 5.93 billion tons; Phosphate rock completed 652% of the Five-Year Plan, and the cumulative proven reserves by the end of 1957 were 300 million tons; Pyrite completed 363% of the Five-Year Plan, and the cumulative proven reserves by the end of 1957 were 66.6 million tons; Other minerals such as chromium, nickel, cobalt, magnesium, vanadium, titanium, beryllium, lithium, mercury, boron, piezoelectric quartz, asbestos, mica, etc. have all been proven to have considerable reserves, which will not be listed here one by one. In short, the results of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan not only basically guaranteed the mineral resources for the construction of large and medium-sized enterprises in the Second Five-Year Plan, but also fully proved that our country is a country with very rich mineral resources. As long as we follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, summon up revolutionary spirit, and implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, we can explore the mineral resources needed for the Fourth Five-Year Plan in the next five years.

Although China's mineral resources are much richer than those of the United Kingdom, the quantity, quality, and regional distribution of China's mineral resources cannot fully meet the needs. Therefore, geological workers should redouble their efforts to strive for a new leap forward in geological prospecting and exploration work this year.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called on us to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more. This wise and great call is in line with China's actual situation and is entirely achievable. We have the superiority of the socialist system and various favorable conditions. In terms of mineral resources, we are much richer than the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is abnormally poor in mineral resources. According to the information we have at hand, the total iron ore reserves in the United Kingdom are 3.7 billion tons, with an average grade of 30%, which cannot guarantee the needs of its steel industry development. The import volume of ore has increased year by year since the war. Coal, the reserves in the United Kingdom are 173.9 billion tons, of which the reliable reserves are about 130 billion tons, and the recoverable reserves in these reserves are less than 22 billion tons. The United Kingdom has no long-term prospects for iron and coal reserves. According to preliminary understanding, China's prospective iron ore reserves are 12 billion tons, and coal's prospective reserves are 1.5 trillion tons. The United Kingdom lacks manganese, and its annual demand relies entirely on imports. Copper ore, the United Kingdom's mining volume accounted for half of the world's total mining volume at the beginning of the 19th century, but since the 20th century, most of the country's copper mines have been exhausted, and it now imports 300,000 to 400,000 tons every year. The United Kingdom's lead-zinc, tungsten and aluminum deposits are very limited; lead deposits are only 15,000 tons, zinc deposits are only 20,000 tons, tungsten deposits are only 1,800 tons, and these reserves are only comparable to a small ore deposit in our country. Aluminum is very scarce on mainland Britain. The foreign resources that monopoly capital can control are no more than 200 million tons. Other minerals such as nickel, chromium, vanadium, titanium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, mercury, beryllium, petroleum, asbestos, and mica are completely absent or negligible.

In short, the United Kingdom is a country poor in minerals. In the past, it relied on plundering the resources of colonies and importing ores to open factories and achieve its current level of industrial production. However, due to the surging development of national independence movements, the possibility of obtaining resources from abroad has been greatly reduced and restricted. From the perspective of resource conditions, we are fully confident that we can catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of important industrial products in the next fifteen years.

At the same time, it must be pointed out that although China's mineral resources are much richer than those of the United Kingdom, in order to prepare sufficient mineral resources according to the scale and development speed of industrial construction necessary for "catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in fifteen years," according to the principle of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, and to adapt to the increasing need for rare metals and dispersed elements for the leap-forward development of science and technology, the proven mineral resources cannot fully meet the needs in terms of quantity, quality, and regional distribution, and some minerals have not yet been proven to have reserves. Therefore, geological workers must redouble their efforts to strive for a new leap forward in geological prospecting and exploration work in 1958, to find and explore more and better mineral resources, and to meet the needs of national construction as soon as possible.

In 1957, more than 90 new mineral sites with industrial value were found, making it possible to have more reserve exploration bases and rapid growth in reserves in 1958. This requires us to break the right-leaning conservative thinking that hinders our great leap forward.

The great victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957 greatly promoted China's geological cause, improved the political consciousness of employees, and boosted the enthusiasm of employees. The majority of employees summoned up revolutionary spirit and launched a high tide of mineral exploration and reserve exploration. Through the arduous efforts of the majority of employees, many new geological achievements were achieved in 1957, making it possible to have more reserve exploration bases and rapid growth in reserves in 1958. In 1957, more mineral reserves were proven than in 1956. The Ministry of Geology alone proven 20% more iron ore, about 50% more coal and phosphate rock, 33% more copper ore, 60% more lead ore, and more than double the amount of aluminum ore. Through the general survey and regional geological survey in 1957, more than 90 new mineral sites with industrial value were found, including 16 iron ore sites, most of which are of high grade, which guarantees the resource problem of small and medium-sized steel plants; considerable-scale copper and lead-zinc mines were discovered in Tieling and Hunchun, Northeast China, providing raw material bases for the non-ferrous metal smelting industry in Northeast China; an ultra-basic rock belt extending more than 1,000 kilometers and several promising chromite deposits were found in Inner Mongolia, creating conditions for increasing chromite reserves in the future; large-scale phosphate and pyrite mines were found in Xiangyang, Hubei; new boron deposits were found in Northeast China; high-quality manganese mines were found in Guangdong and Yunnan, etc., which prepared sufficient exploration bases for 1958. After the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle, many field teams showed a new phenomenon: bureaucracy was reduced, working methods were improved, leading cadres walked out of the office to participate in grassroots work and production labor, and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees was unprecedentedly high, and a large number of people broke through the production quotas. For example, the Suixi Team in Anhui completed 136.4% of the quota in September and 142.2% of the quota in October. In December, the Fengcheng Team and Dexing Team in Jiangxi, the Shaoyang Team and Huangshaping Team in Hunan, the Fenyang Team and Zhongtiaoshan Team in Shanxi, the Mayukou Team in Hebei, and the Shiqingdong Team in Gansu all completed 130% to 163% of the quota. After discovering the chromite deposit in the uninhabited area, the Inner Mongolia Chromite Prospecting Team did not close the team in winter, braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees, and continued to conduct field surveys regardless of wind and snow. In just three or four months, the Changbai Mountain Prospecting Team carefully inspected 250 mineralization points, carried out a lot of light mountain work, and found 18 promising mineral sites, five of which are of great industrial value and can be transferred to exploration in 1958. These new phenomena fully illustrate that under the correct leadership of the Party, as long as all employees continue to work tirelessly and resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, we will be able to form a new great leap forward in geological work in 1958.

Some comrades believe that the proven mineral reserves can guarantee the country's urgent needs and can be carried out slowly, and that the potential for geology is not great, and that a leap forward requires an increase in manpower and equipment. This is a right-leaning conservative thinking, which is a serious obstacle to the forward leap of geological work. We must further mobilize the masses in the in-depth rectification stage of the rectification movement, let everyone speak out freely and contend, oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, burn waste, tap potential, summon up all our energy, and strive for the best, to complete or overfulfill the 1958 plan tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Strive to find more exploration bases in 1958, explore various mineral reserves urgently needed for the construction of large, medium, and small enterprises, and create a good start for completing or overfulfilling the Second Five-Year Plan. And lay a better foundation for preparing the mineral resources needed to catch up with the British industrial level in the next five years.

    为赶上英国工业水平准备足够的矿产资源
    地质部副部长刘景范的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，薄一波副总理关于一九五八年国民经济计划草案的报告和吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革和汉语拼音方案的报告。
    第一个五年计划规定的十九种矿产储量的勘探任务绝大部分已完成或超额完成，工业建设所需要的主要矿产储量有了巨大增长。
    一九五七年经过伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，我们在政治战线和思想战线上取得了伟大的胜利，这个胜利促进了社会主义的各项建设事业，同样促进了地质工作的新发展。地质部一九五七年地质勘探工作总量比一九五六年增长了百分之十七，比第一个五年计划中规定的一九五七年指标超额完成了百分之二十五。其他各工业部门的地质工作，也有很大的发展。第一个五年国家计划规定的十九种矿产储量任务（包括各工业部门在内），除铬、油页岩和水泥石灰岩以外，都完成或超额完成了，另外还探明了国家计划以外的三十种矿产储量。第一个五年计划执行的结果，工业建设所需要的主要矿产储量有了巨大的增长。例如：铁矿，到一九五七年底累计探明的储量四十五亿五千四百万吨，完成了五年计划的百分之一百八十五，连同一九五二年底以前探明的一亿四千五百万吨，共四十七亿吨，占世界各国的第三位，仅次于苏联和印度，超过了法国和美国（苏联三百五十三亿吨，印度五十一亿吨，法国三十九亿吨，美国二十九亿五千万吨）；煤矿，到一九五七年底累计探明的储量三百二十五亿五千万吨，完成了五年计划的百分之一百六十一，连同生产矿山在生产过程中探明的一百一十七亿吨，共四百四十二亿吨，居世界第六位；锰矿，完成了五年计划的百分之一百八十六，探明的储量居世界第二位，仅次于苏联，超过了赤道非洲（赤道非洲五千万吨）；铜矿，完成了五年计划的百分之一百四十一，探明的储量居于世界第六位，次于苏联、北罗德西亚、美国、智利、比属刚果，超过了加拿大（六百万吨）；铅矿，完成了五年计划的百分之一百六十七，探明的储量次于苏联居世界第二位，超过了澳大利亚（三百二十万吨）；钨矿，完成了五年计划的百分之一百五十三，探明的储量次于苏联居世界第二位，超过了资本主义国家储量的总和（美国五万一千吨，南朝鲜四万吨，其他资本主义国家合计十一万九千吨）；铝矿，完成了五年计划的百分之一百八十，探明的储量居于世界第二位，大大的超过了美国（五千万吨），仅次于苏联；锡矿，完成了五年计划的百分之一百零八，钼矿完成了五年计划的百分之七百一十一，第一个五年探明的储量，锡矿超过了一向居于世界首位的马来亚（七十八万吨），钼矿超过了一向居于世界首位的美国（七十万吨）；石油，第一个五年探明的储量比一九五二年底的储量增加了二点四倍；油页岩完成了五年计划的百分之八十三，到一九五七年底累计探明的储量五十九亿三千万吨；磷矿，完成了五年计划的百分之六百五十二，到一九五七年底累计探明的储量三亿吨；黄铁矿，完成了五年计划的百分之三百六十三，到一九五七年底累计探明的储量六千六百六十万吨；其他矿产如铬、镍、钴、镁、钒、钛、铍、锂、汞、硼、压电石英、石棉、云母等都探明了相当的储量，这里就不一一列举了。总之，第一个五年计划执行结果，不仅基本上保证了第二个五年建设大、中型企业的矿产资源，而且充分的证明了我国是一个矿产资源十分丰富的国家，只要我们遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，鼓起革命干劲，贯彻执行多、快、好、省的方针，在今后的五年内就可以探明第四个五年计划所需要的矿产资源。
    我国的矿产资源虽然比英国丰富的多，但是我国的矿产资源在数量质量和地区分布上还不能完全满足需要，因此，地质工作者应该加倍努力，争取今年在地质普查勘探工作上有个新跃进。
    党中央和毛主席号召我们在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。这个英明伟大的号召，是切合我国实际情况的，是完全能够实现的。我们有社会主义制度的优越性和各种有利条件，就矿产资源来说，我们比英国丰富得多。英国矿产资源异常贫乏。根据我们手头掌握的资料，英国铁矿总储量为三十七亿吨，平均品位百分之三十，不能保证它的钢铁工业发展的需要，战后矿石进口量逐年增加。煤矿，英国的储量为一千七百三十九亿吨，其中可靠储量约为一千三百亿吨，这些储量中的可采储量不到二百二十亿吨。英国的铁和煤再无远景储量了，我国铁矿的远景储量据初步了解就有一百二十亿吨，煤的远景储量有一万五千亿吨。英国缺锰，每年需要量全靠进口。铜矿，英国在十九世纪初，开采量占世界开采总量的一半，但二十世纪以来，本国铜矿已大部采尽，现在每年要进口三、四十万吨。英国的铅锌矿、钨矿和铝矿十分有限，铅矿只有一万五千吨，锌矿只有二万吨，钨矿只有一千八百吨，这些储量只能和我国一个小的矿床相比较；铝在英国本土上很缺，垄断资本所能控制的国外资源亦不过二亿吨。其他如镍、铬、钒、钛、钼、锡、锑、汞、铍、石油、石棉、云母等矿产则完全没有或微不足道。
    总之，英国是一个矿产贫乏的国家，它在过去依靠了掠夺殖民地的资源和矿石进口，开办了工厂，有了现在的工业生产水平。但由于民族独立运动的澎湃发展，大大缩小和限制了取于国外资源的可能。我国从资源条件上来看，完全有信心在今后十五年内能在重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。
    同时必须指出，我国矿产资源虽比英国丰富的多，但按照“十五年赶上或者超过英国”所必须的工业建设规模和发展速度，准备好足够的矿产资源，按照大、中、小型企业建设相结合的方针对矿产资源的要求，并适应科学技术飞跃发展对稀有金属和分散元素的日益需要，已经探明的矿产资源，在数量、质量和地区分布上，还不能完全满足需要，有些矿产还没有探明储量。因此，地质工作者们还要加倍的努力，争取在一九五八年地质普查勘探工作上有一个新的跃进，寻找到和勘探出更多、更好的矿产资源，尽快满足国家建设的需要。
    一九五七年找到了具有工业价值的新的矿产地九十多处，使一九五八年有了更多的后备勘探基地和迅速增长储量的可能。这就要求我们打破阻碍我们大跃进的右倾保守思想。
    一九五七年整风与反右派斗争的伟大胜利，大大的推动了我国地质事业，提高了职工政治觉悟，鼓舞了职工的积极性，广大职工鼓起了革命干劲，掀起了找矿和勘探储量的高潮。通过了广大职工的艰苦努力，一九五七年取得了许多新的地质成果，使一九五八年有了更多的后备勘探基地和迅速增长储量的可能。一九五七年比一九五六年多探明了许多矿产储量，仅地质部就多探明了百分之二十的铁矿，百分之五十左右的煤矿和磷矿，百分之三十三的铜矿，百分之六十的铅矿和一倍以上的铝矿。经过一九五七年的普查和区域地质测量，找到了具有工业价值的新的矿产地九十多处，其中有铁矿十六处，大部分品位较高，对解决中、小型钢铁厂的资源问题，有了保证；在东北铁岭和珲春发现了相当规模的铜矿和铅锌矿，为东北有色金属冶炼工业找到了原料基地；在内蒙古找到了延长一千多公里的超基性岩带及几个具有远景的铬铁矿床，为今后增长铬铁矿储量创造了条件；在湖北襄阳找到了大规模的磷矿和黄铁矿；在东北又找到了新的硼矿床；在广东和云南找到了优质锰矿，等等，为一九五八年准备了充分的勘探基地。许多野外队在整风和反右派斗争之后，出现了一片新现象，官僚主义减少了，工作方法改进了，领导干部走出了办公室参加了基层工作和生产劳动，广大职工群众劳动热情空前高涨，大量的突破了生产定额，如安徽睢溪队九月份完成定额百分之一百三十六点四，十月份完成定额百分之一百四十二点二，十二月份江西的丰城队、德兴队，湖南的邵阳队、黄沙坪队，山西的汾阳队、中条山队，河北的麻峪口队，甘肃的石青硐队等，都完成定额百分之一百三十至一百六十三。内蒙古铬矿普查队，在荒无人烟的地区内发现了铬铁矿床以后，冬季不收队，冒着零下三十多度的严寒，不避风雪，继续进行野外勘查。长白山普查队在短短的三、四个月中，认真的检查了二百五十个矿化点，作了许多轻型山地工作，找到了有希望的矿产地十八处，其中五处很有工业价值，一九五八年就可以转入勘探。以上这些新气象充分说明：在党的正确领导下，只要全体职工继续努力不懈，坚决的克服右倾保守思想，我们在一九五八年是能在地质工作方面形成一个新的大跃进的。
    有些同志认为探明的矿产储量能够保证国家急需了，可以慢慢的来，认为地质方面的潜力不大，要跃进就要增加人力和设备，这是一种右倾保守思想，这是地质工作向前跃进的严重障碍，我们必须在整风运动的深入整改阶段，进一步地发动群众，大鸣大放，大争大辩，反对右倾保守思想，烧掉浪费，挖掘潜力，鼓足干劲，力争上游，做到又多、又快、又好、又省的完成或超额完成一九五八年的计划任务。争取在一九五八年内，找寻到更多的勘探基地，勘探出大、中、小型企业建设急需要的各种矿产储量，为完成或超额完成第二个五年计划，创造一个良好的开端。并为争取在今后五年内，准备好赶上英国工业水平所需要的矿产资源，打下更好的基础。
