    Spring Festival in Chiang Kai-shek's Military Barracks
    Ding Gu
    According to Taiwan newspapers, from New Year's Day to the Spring Festival, Chiang Kai-shek's military barracks in Taiwan presented a scene of depression and desolation, with some soldiers weeping in secret.

    A Taiwan newspaper, in discussing the psychological changes of Chiang's officers and soldiers, said that when Chiang's officers and soldiers first arrived in Taiwan, they used the dream of "counterattacking the mainland" as a "buffer for their sadness." However, as time passed year after year, the dream gradually shattered, and the pain deepened. Before the Spring Festival, some Chiang's officers and soldiers bought sleeping pills to numb themselves with sleep; some elderly mainland-born soldiers burned incense and chanted Buddhist scriptures every day, praying to "God" to bless them not to die on the isolated island of Taiwan and to return home to reunite with their families as soon as possible. A soldier surnamed Chen from the 243rd Regiment of the 81st Division of Chiang's army, suffering from severe "delusional mania" for a long time due to missing his family on the mainland day and night, would grab old women and shout "Mom" upon seeing them, and was sent to a mental hospital. Many Taiwanese youths who were forced to serve as soldiers in Kinmen and Matsu wore amulets with the words "World Peace, Family Safety" written on them. A doggerel also circulated among them: "The moon is curved, shining on the nine continents, when will the soldiers' suffering end? Building fortifications day and night, our youth is thrown into the water!"

    The Chiang Kai-shek army's "Military Friends Society" stipulated that the month before and after the Spring Festival should be "Respect the Military Month," and every Taiwanese resident was required to invite a Chiang Kai-shek officer or soldier to their home for food and drink. However, Taiwanese residents would "close their doors and remain silent" or "treat them with cold eyes" when they saw Chiang's officers and soldiers coming.

    Taiwan newspapers continuously publish news of Chiang's officers and soldiers seeking honorary sisters or honorary parents. The Taipei "News Observation" weekly recently published a letter from Zheng Biting, a mainland-born Chiang Kai-shek naval officer, "Seeking an Honorary Sister," which said: "Being away from home for a long time often stirs up infinite homesickness! Watching the sunset in the evening, counting the cold at night; I often gaze alone at the distant place across the sea, but the more I look, the more empty I feel inside... I have always been confined in the fence of loneliness, with nothing but the bitter sea of desolation..." Another 31-year-old mainland-born Chiang Kai-shek soldier surnamed Zhang stated in a letter "Seeking Honorary Parents": "Serving as a soldier for more than ten years, wandering alone at the ends of the earth, I have endless tears to shed and endless sorrows to cry out. I hate! Hate! Hate! I cry in bed! Cry! Cry! Cry! Crying my heart out is useless! Therefore, I want to find a warm home and a pair of kind honorary parents." Taiwan newspapers said that their appeals were written with tears mixed with ink.

    In order to maintain the morale of Chiang's army, the Chiang Kai-shek clique recently recruited prostitutes and shamelessly clamored to train a so-called "female corps," using their "spiritual power" to stabilize the nerves of Chiang's officers and soldiers. Many brothels are set up on the islands of Kinmen and Matsu, each with a portrait of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang party flag hanging in it. However, this measure of corrupting social morality has not been significantly effective, and the tragedies of Chiang's officers and soldiers deserting and committing suicide still occur frequently. Not long ago, a 23-year-old private second class from the machine gun company of the first battalion of the 95th Regiment of Chiang's army stationed on Kinmen Island feigned illness and slept all day, crying of homesickness at night, and finally hanged himself with a strap on a tree. A Chiang Kai-shek army officer surnamed Ding, originally from Yantai, Shandong, from the demonstration company of the Army Infantry School, committed suicide with a carbine in the middle of the night. Recently, dozens of Chiang Kai-shek senior officers, completely despondent about the "counterattack the mainland" nonsense, jointly requested retirement from the Taiwan Kuomintang "Ministry of National Defense," and were arrested by order of Chiang Kai-shek.

    春节在蒋军兵营中
    丁固
    据台湾报纸透露：从新年到春节，台湾的蒋军兵营里是一片消沉、凄凉的景象，有些士兵在暗中哭泣。
    台湾一家报纸谈到蒋军官兵的心理变化时说，蒋军官兵到台湾之初，曾把“反攻大陆”的梦想“用来作感伤的缓冲”。然而，时间一年一年地过去，梦想逐渐破灭，痛苦也更为加深了。春节前，有些蒋军官兵买了安眠药，用睡梦来麻醉自己；有些年老的大陆籍的士兵，天天烧香念佛，求“老天爷”保佑他们不要死在台湾孤岛上，早日回家和亲人团聚。蒋军八十一师二四三团有个姓陈的士兵，长期以来因为日夜想念在大陆的家属，患了严重的“幻想狂症”，一见到年老的妇人就拉着喊“妈妈”，被送进了疯人院。许多被强迫到金门、马祖当兵的台湾青年，不少人身上都挂着一个写着“天下太平、人口平安”字样的符袋，他们中间还流传着一首打油诗：“月儿弯弯照九洲，当兵的苦闷何时休？白天黑夜修工事，却把青春水里丢！”
    蒋军“军人之友社”规定春节前后一个月为“敬军月”，每家台湾居民要请一名蒋军官兵到家里吃喝。但是，台湾居民见到蒋军官兵一来就“闭门不语”，或者“冷眼相待”。
    台湾报纸上不断刊登蒋军官兵征求义姊妹或义父母的消息。台北“新闻观察”周报不久前刊登了大陆籍的蒋军海军士官郑璧亭“征求义姊”的一封信，信上说：“离家久了，常惹起无限的乡愁！黄昏送落日，深夜数寒心；我时常独自眺望隔海的远处，但却越看越使自己内心感到空虚。……我是一直被禁在孤独的樊篱里，除了凄凉的苦海以外，别无其他……。”另一个三十一岁姓张的大陆籍蒋军士兵在“征求义父母”的信中自述：“当兵十多年，天涯海角，只身飘零，自己有流不尽的热泪，有唤不尽的苦楚。我恨！恨！恨！我躺在床上哭！哭！哭！哭！哭断了肝肠也无用啊！因此，我要找一个温暖之家和一双慈祥的义父母。”台湾报纸说，他们的呼吁是用眼泪渗和着墨水写出来的。
    蒋介石集团为了维持蒋军士气，最近招募军妓，并且无耻地扬言要训练一支所谓“女性兵团”，用她们的“精神力量”来安定蒋军官兵的神经。在金门、马祖等岛屿上，都设有许多军妓院，每个军妓院中都挂着蒋介石像和国民党党旗。可是，这种败坏社会道德的措施并没有显著成效，蒋军官兵逃亡、自杀的惨事仍然常常发生。不久以前，驻在金门岛上的蒋军九五团一营机枪连有个二十三岁的二等兵，白天装病大睡，夜里思乡痛哭，最后他自己在一棵树上用绑带吊死了。蒋军陆军步兵学校示范连有个原籍山东烟台的姓丁的军官在深夜里用卡宾枪自杀了。最近，台湾有几十名蒋军高级军官由于对“反攻大陆”的鬼话完全绝望，向台湾国民党“国防部”联名要求退休，结果被蒋介石下令逮捕。
