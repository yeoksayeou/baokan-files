Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to a broadcast from the Padang radio station controlled by the Central Sumatra separatists: The Central Sumatra separatists held a so-called mass meeting in Padang on February 9th, demanding the immediate resignation of the Djuanda cabinet. These elements also demanded that acting President Sartono appoint former Vice President Hatta and the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Buwono, as the formers of a new cabinet, and demanded the cancellation of the government's order banning barter trade.

The Padang radio station reported that the conference, manipulated by separatists, threatened in a resolution handed to Lieutenant Colonel Hussein, chairman of the "Wild Bull Division Committee," that if the central government refused to accept the above demands, they would ask Hussein to "take definite action."

Former First Military District Commander Simbolon, who betrayed the Indonesian central government, and former Third Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Djambek, spoke at the meeting.

Some Western journalists attended the conference, waiting for the "startling news" they expected.

Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda told Antara News Agency reporters on the 10th that the government would definitely not accept the Central Sumatra separatists' demand to force the cabinet to resign.

Wahab, a member of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, said on the issue that the government should take definite measures to deal with illegal actions. He said the current cabinet should continue to exist and work.

A spokesman for the Indonesian Army Headquarters said on the evening of the 8th that Army Chief of Staff Nasution had telegraphed Hussein in Central Sumatra, ordering him to attend the upcoming All-Sumatra Commanders Conference and report to the conference on the situation of the secret meeting held in Sungai Dareh, Central Sumatra. This meeting was related to the conspiracy to establish a "Sumatra state". The Army Chief of Staff also ordered Hussein to carry out the order to arrest Lubis.

The Indonesian Republic Non-Commissioned Officers Association issued a statement on the evening of the 8th, expressing its firm opposition to the conspiracy to establish a new "government" or a new "country" in Sumatra. The statement said that these activities were carried out by a small group of political and military speculators.

On the 10th, Jakarta newspapers continued to condemn the activities of the Central Sumatra separatist group. "Dongxing Daily" said that the separatists' strategy was to establish an institution that resisted the central government, regardless of the name used by the institution. "Indonesia News" hoped that disciplinary measures would be taken against those military officers who violated the law.
