(Our newspaper, Guiyang, 26th) The industrial departments of Chongqing Municipality are promoting the spirit of socialist revolution and vigorously helping Zunyi Prefecture, Guizhou Province, develop local industry.

Zunyi Prefecture is adjacent to Chongqing Municipality, but its industry is very backward. This area raises the most pigs in Guizhou Province, but due to inconvenient transportation, it is difficult to transport them out, so there is an urgent need to build a meat canning factory. The food processing departments of Chongqing Municipality have helped Zunyi Prefecture train technical, management personnel, and workers, provided design information, and sent people to Zunyi City to help with construction and installation.

The silk weaving factory in Zunyi Prefecture has been losing money for several years. In mid-January, the Chongqing Silk Spinning Factory sent a deputy chief engineer, an engineer, and seven technical and management cadres to help the Zunyi Silk Weaving Factory delve into the workshop to investigate the reasons for the losses. After investigation, they proposed many concrete measures to increase labor productivity and equipment utilization, reduce losses, and improve tools; and they gave operation demonstrations to all the factory's employees, which greatly educated and inspired them, and quickly improved their work. Based on the situation after the work improvements, it is estimated that in 1958, not only will the factory not lose money, but it will also have a profit of 90,000 yuan. To better utilize the silk weaving factory's waste products, the technical personnel of the Chongqing Silk Spinning Factory proactively offered to help the Zunyi Silk Weaving Factory design a silk spinning workshop, and also helped solve the problems of technical manpower and mechanical equipment.

Chongqing also transferred a 2,000 kW thermal power generator to Zunyi City to help solve the urgently needed industrial power problem. According to relevant leading comrades in Guizhou Province, Guizhou Province will receive more assistance from Chongqing Municipality in developing local industry in the future.

    重庆帮助遵义专区发展工业
    本报贵阳26日电　重庆市工业部门发扬社会主义革命精神，大力帮助贵州遵义专区发展地方工业。
    遵义地区与重庆市相邻，工业十分落后。这个地区是贵州省养猪最多的地区，由于交通不便，很难外运，急需建设肉食罐头厂。重庆市的食品加工部门，便帮助遵义专区训练技术、管理人员和工人，提供设计资料，并且派人到遵义市帮助建设安装。
    遵义专区的丝织厂，几年来一直亏本。1月中旬，重庆绢纺厂派去一个副总工程师、一个工程师和七个技术、管理干部，帮助遵义丝织厂深入车间检查亏本的原因。经过检查，提出提高劳动生产率和设备利用率、减少损耗、改进工具等许多具体办法；并给全厂职工进行了操作表演，使全厂职工受到很大教育和启发，很快改进了工作。根据改进工作以后的情况看，1958年不但不会亏本，而且还有九万元的利润。为了更好地利用丝织厂的废品，重庆绢纺厂的技术人员主动提出帮助遵义丝织厂设计绢纺车间，并且帮助解决技术力量和机械设备。
    重庆还调了一台二千瓩的火力发电机给遵义市，以便帮助遵义市解决急需的工业动力问题。据贵州省有关领导同志谈，贵州省在今后发展地方工业中，还将得到重庆市的更多帮助。
