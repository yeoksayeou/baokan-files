　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch from Prague: Renowned American progressive economist Victor Perlo, in an article he wrote for the Czechoslovak News Agency, pointed out that the current American economy is by no means merely a "recession," but "a severe economic downturn that is set to become the longest-lasting since the war." The American economy is facing "a major crisis."
    In the article entitled "Has the Economic Crisis in America Already Begun?" Perlo analyzed production indicators for the period from the second week of January 1957 to the second week of January 1958. He said that steel production fell by 48%, automobiles by 17%, coal by 6%, crude oil by 7%, and business bankruptcies increased by 27%.
    He said that in July 1957, the number of unemployed in the United States was three million; by mid-January of this year, the number of unemployed had reached five million. Because some unemployed people are not included in this figure, it is estimated that today in the United States, certainly more than one in ten industrial workers is already unemployed. Many workers are unable to repay installments due to insufficient income, and they are losing the homes, cars, and household goods they purchased on installment plans.
    Perlo said that American agriculture has been on the decline for the past decade. The number of farms has decreased by one million. The net income of all farmers has decreased by one-third, even though their total production has increased by one-fifth. The current general industrial decline will likely turn the long-term agricultural decline into an acute agricultural crisis.
    Perlo continued, another problem is the increase in debt. The national debt of the United States was 606 billion US dollars in 1954, and increased to 708 billion US dollars by 1957. Another problem is the surplus in American industrial productivity. By January 1958, the industrial operating rate was only 73%.
    Perlo finally pointed out that the arms expansion policy of American monopoly capitalists "cannot extricate the American economy from insoluble contradictions."

### 不仅是一次衰退　而且是持久下降  美国经济面临战后最大危机  著名经济学家佩洛指出

　　不仅是一次衰退　而且是持久下降
    美国经济面临战后最大危机
    著名经济学家佩洛指出
    据新华社8日讯　布拉格消息：美国著名进步经济学家维克托·佩洛在他替捷克斯洛伐克通讯社写的一篇文章里指出，目前的美国经济决不仅仅是一次“衰退”，而且是“一次将要成为战后延续最久的严重经济下降”。美国经济面临的是“一次重大的危机”。
    在题为“美国的经济危机是不是已经开始？”的这篇文章里，佩洛对1957年1月第二个星期到1958年1月第二个星期这一段时期内的生产指标作了分析。他说，钢的生产下降了48％，汽车下降17％，煤下降6％，原油下降7％，商业破产增加了27％。
    他说，1957年7月美国失业人数是三百万；今年1月中旬，失业人数已经达到五百万。由于某些失业人员不计算在这个数字之内，所以估计美国今天每十个工业工人中肯定有一个人以上已经失业。许多工人由于收入不足而无法偿付分期付款，他们正在失去他们用分期付款购进的住宅、汽车和家用品。
    佩洛说，美国农业最近十年来一直在走下坡路。农场数目已经减少一百万。全体农民的纯收入减少了三分之一，尽管他们的总生产增加了五分之一。目前的工业总下降很可能会把长期的农业下降变成一个尖锐的农业危机。
    佩洛继续写道，另外一个问题是债务的增加。美国全国的债务在1954年是六千零六十亿美元，到1957年增加到了七千零八十亿美元。还有一个问题是美国工业生产力过剩。到1958年1月，工业开工率只达73％。
    佩洛最后指出，美国垄断资本家的扩军政策“不能使美国经济摆脱不能解决的矛盾。”
