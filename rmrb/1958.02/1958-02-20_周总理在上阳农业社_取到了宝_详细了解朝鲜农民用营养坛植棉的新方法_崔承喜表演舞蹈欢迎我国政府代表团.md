Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 19th: Premier Zhou Enlai, leading the Chinese government delegation, spent a pleasant afternoon today with the farmers of the Shangyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zewan-ri, Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, Korea.

Premier Zhou Enlai said he "found a treasure." The "treasure" he referred to was a nutrient pot for planting cotton, given to him by Kim Doo-hwan, the cotton production team leader of the agricultural cooperative.

The story unfolded as follows: While Premier Zhou Enlai was viewing the agricultural cooperative's five-year plan production chart in the cooperative's office, he noticed that the cooperative had harvested over 1,100 kilograms per chongbo (approximately 15 Chinese mu) in its first year of cotton planting last year. Furthermore, they aimed to more than triple the cotton yield this year. Premier Zhou Enlai asked Kim Doo-hwan how they planned to achieve this goal. At that moment, Kim Doo-hwan presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a fist-sized, rectangular, earth-yellow nutrient pot. Kim Doo-hwan explained that cotton planted using nutrient pots last year yielded more than twice the amount compared to cotton planted using ordinary methods. Their method of increasing production this year involved extending this cotton planting method to all cotton fields. Premier Zhou Enlai carefully examined the structure of the nutrient pot and inquired in detail about the method of making the nutrient pot, as well as the number of plants planted per chongbo and the planting method. The nutrient pot is made from 60% decomposed tree leaves, 10% cow dung, and 30% soil. Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his intention to take the nutrient pot back to China for research and study.

Premier Zhou Enlai greatly praised the agricultural cooperative's method of planting cotton. At this time, the agricultural cooperative's office was crowded with people, who listened with great interest to the conversation. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, General Su Yu, and Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang engaged in a long conversation with the agricultural cooperative members, who surrounded them. They discussed production experience and living conditions, as freely as if they were family. An elderly woman named Choi Sa-ryeol, 65 years old, held Premier Zhou Enlai's hand tightly and spoke a string of moving words. During the war, her family was killed by American planes, and she was rescued from the fire by the Chinese People's Volunteers. She said, "I will never forget the Volunteers. The Volunteers saved my old life. I want to live and build our motherland, and strive for the peaceful reunification of our country."

Premier Zhou Enlai and others arrived at the village, about thirty kilometers from Pyongyang, around 4 p.m. today, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nam Il. As the distinguished guests walked through the archway at the entrance of the village, adorned with the national flags of both Korea and China, more than two thousand male and female agricultural cooperative members, dressed in festive attire, gathered in a field in front of the village, shouting enthusiastic cheers. They waved countless colorful flags and bouquets, and cheered "Long live!" "Long live!" to the Chinese guests. A 79-year-old white-haired man presented flowers to Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing the greatest respect of the entire village. Premier Zhou Enlai waved his hat continuously to the masses in salute.

Li Seon-yeong, the Labour Party primary party secretary (i.e., branch secretary) of the agricultural cooperative, spoke at the agricultural cooperative's welcoming delegation meeting. He said that all members felt infinitely honored to welcome the Chinese delegation today. He said that the agricultural cooperative was initially formed by twelve poor peasant households in December 1953, and has now grown to four hundred and fifty households, and the living standards of the members have also improved to above the middle peasant level. He said, "We have learned many valuable advanced experiences from China's agricultural collectivization movement and agricultural economic achievements." He also hoped that the delegation would convey the close friendship of Korean farmers to the members of Chinese agricultural cooperatives.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke to the cheering agricultural cooperative members. He said that in just a few years, the rural areas of northern Korea, like the rural areas of China, have fully realized agricultural collectivization. The rapid recovery and development of agriculture in Korea after the war demonstrates the superiority of socialist collective production, and also demonstrates the concern of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and Premier Kim Il-sung for the development of agriculture and the lives of farmers.

He praised the production achievements of the Shangyang Agricultural Cooperative. He said, "I heard that your cooperative is doing very well. By promoting advanced methods such as cold-bed seedling transplanting and nutrient pot cotton planting, you have greatly increased grain and cotton production, and have also developed diverse economic operations such as orchards, animal husbandry, and silkworm breeding, setting a good example. This not only guarantees the improvement of the lives of the members, but also makes a practical contribution to strengthening socialist construction and striving for the peaceful reunification of your country." He also said, "After our visit, we will introduce your good experiences to the farmers in China." Premier Zhou Enlai finally wished the agricultural cooperative members a greater harvest this year.

Premier Zhou Enlai and others also visited the home of a farmer. In the farmer's house, thick cotton quilts were piled high on the kang, and tall grain stacks were piled in the yard, all showing the improved living conditions of farmers after collectivization.

As the delegation was about to leave, all the farmers in the village gathered in the open space in front of the village, playing national musical instruments, and old women and young men and women danced national dances together, enthusiastically sending off the delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 19th: Choi Seung-hee, a domestic and internationally renowned Korean dancer, and the National Choi Seung-hee Dance Theatre she leads, performed the famous Korean dance drama "The Story of Sado Castle" tonight to welcome the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai.

Korean Workers' Party and Korean government leaders Kim Il-sung, Choi Yong-kun, Park Jung-ae and others accompanied the viewing of the performance. When they, along with Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, General Su Yu, and Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang, took their seats in the box, people from all walks of life in Korea and foreign envoys present stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

"The Story of Sado Castle" vividly depicts the love between the only daughter of the old city lord of Sado Castle on the east coast of Korea and a soldier from a fishing background during the middle period of Silla, as well as the patriotism they displayed in resisting the invasion of Japanese pirates and defending their motherland.

Choi Seung-hee played the old city lord's only daughter, Geum-hee, in this dance drama. With superb artistry, she perfectly expressed this historical figure, leaving a deep impression on the audience.

After the performance, Premier Zhou Enlai and others presented flower baskets to the Korean artists, and accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung and others, went on stage to meet the artists.

    周总理在上阳农业社“取到了宝”
    详细了解朝鲜农民用营养坛植棉的新方法
    崔承喜表演舞蹈欢迎我国政府代表团
    新华社平壤19日电　周恩来总理率领的中国政府代表团今天同朝鲜平安南道顺安郡泽岩里上阳农业生产合作社的农民们一起欢度了一个下午。
    周恩来总理说，他“取到了宝”。他说的“宝”就是这个农业社的棉花生产队长金斗焕送给他的一个种植棉花用的营养坛。
    事情的经过是这样的：周恩来总理在农业社办公室里观看农业社的五年计划生产图表的时候，发现这个农业社去年第一次种植棉花就每町步（大约合十五市亩）收获了一千一百多公斤，而且要在今年使棉花的产量达到去年的三倍多。周恩来总理问金斗焕怎样来实现这个计划。金斗焕就在这时候把一个拳头大的方柱形的土黄色营养坛送到周恩来总理的手中。金斗焕说，他们去年用营养坛种植的棉花比用普通方法种植的棉花，产量高一倍多。今年他们增产的办法就是把这个植棉方法推广到全部棉田中去。周恩来总理仔细地观看了营养坛的构造，并且详细地询问了做营养坛的方法，以及每町步种植的株数、种植方法。营养坛是用60％的腐化的树叶子、10％的牛粪和30％的泥土做成的。周恩来总理表示要把这个营养坛带回中国研究学习。
    周恩来总理十分赞扬农业社种植棉花的方法。这时，在农业社的办公室内外挤满了人群，人们十分有兴趣地听了这场谈话。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长、张闻天副部长、粟裕大将、乔晓光大使在这个屋子里，同团团地围绕着他们的农业社员们进行了长时间的谈话。他们谈生产经验，谈生活情况，无拘无束地像一家人一样。一个名叫崔史烈的六十五岁的老太太，紧紧地拉着周恩来总理的手说出了一串激动人心的话。在战时，她的一家人被美国飞机炸死，她是被中国人民志愿军从火堆中救出来的。她说，我永远忘不了志愿军。志愿军救了我这一条老命，我要活下去，建设我们的祖国，为祖国的和平统一而努力。
    周恩来总理等是在今天下午四时许，由金日成首相和南日副首相兼外务相陪同到达这个距离平壤约三十公里的农村的。当贵宾们走进村口的飘扬着朝中两国国旗的牌楼时，两千多名农业社男女社员穿着节日服装，聚集在村前一片场地上，一起发出热烈的欢呼。他们挥动着无数彩旗和花束，向中国客人们欢呼“万岁！”“万岁！”一个七十九岁的白发老人向周恩来总理献花，表示全村的最大敬意。周恩来总理不停地挥着帽子向群众致意。
    这个农业社的劳动党初级党委员长（即支部书记）李善英在农业社的欢迎代表团的会上讲话欢迎客人。他说，今天我们能够迎接中国代表团，全体社员感到无限光荣。他说，这个农业社在1953年12月开始建社的时候，是由十二户贫农组成的，现在已发展到四百五十户，社员们的生活水平也提高到中农以上了。他说，我们从中国的农业合作化运动和农业经济的成就中学习了很多宝贵的先进经验。他并且希望代表团把朝鲜农民的亲密友情转达给中国农业社社员们。
    周恩来总理对欢呼着的农业社员们讲了话。他说，仅仅几年时间，朝鲜北部的农村和中国农村一样，已经全面地实现了农业合作化。朝鲜战后农业的迅速恢复和发展，显示了社会主义集体生产的优越性，也表明了朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和金日成首相对于发展农业和农民生活的关怀。
    他赞扬了上阳农业社的生产成就。他说，听说你们的合作社办得很好，由于推广了冷床苗插秧和营养坛植棉的先进方法，大大提高了粮棉产量，并且还发展了果园、畜产和养蚕等多种经济的经营，树立了良好的榜样。这不但保证了社员生活的提高，也是对于加强社会主义建设和争取你们国家的和平统一的实际贡献。他还说，我们在参观以后将把你们的好经验介绍给中国的农民们。周恩来总理最后祝农业社社员们今年获得更大的丰收。
    周恩来总理等还参观一家农民家庭的生活。这家农民屋子里的炕上高高地叠着厚棉被，院子里堆着高大的谷屯，处处表现出合作化后农民生活改善的情形。
    当代表团要离开时，全村农民都聚集在村前的空地上奏起民族乐器，老太太和男女青年一起跳着民族舞蹈，热情欢送代表团。
    新华社平壤19日电　誉满国内外的朝鲜舞蹈家崔承喜和她领导的国立崔承喜舞蹈剧场今天晚上演出了著名朝鲜舞剧“沙道城的故事”，以欢迎周恩来总理所率领的中国政府代表团。
    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府的领导人金日成、崔庸健、朴正爱等陪同观看演出。当他们同周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长、张闻天副部长、粟裕大将、乔晓光大使在包厢入坐的时候，在场的朝鲜各界人士和各国使节全体起立，热烈鼓掌。
      “沙道城的故事”这个舞剧形象地描绘了新罗中叶时期朝鲜东海岸沙道城老城主的独生女儿和一个渔夫出身的军卒之间的爱情以及他们在抗击日寇的侵略、保卫祖国斗争中发挥的爱国主义精神。
    崔承喜在这个舞剧中饰演老城主的独生女儿琴姬。她以卓越的艺术完美地表达了这个历史人物，给观众留下了极深的印象。
    在演出结束以后，周恩来总理等向朝鲜的艺术家们赠送了花篮，并且由金日成首相等陪同，登台和艺术家们会见。
