    Oil Has a Strange Smell When Stored for a Long Time
    Grandma had saved a bottle of peanut oil all year round, frugally, wanting to make some local dishes for her grandson when he came home for the New Year. But when she opened the cork of the oil bottle, a nasty, strange smell came out, and the oil had gone bad. Grandma just blamed herself for not storing it well, but couldn't figure out why the oil had gone bad.
    There are many similar examples in life: such as a bottle of moisturizing cream that developed a strange smell because it was left for too long; a bottle of cod liver oil that was half-eaten and left for a long time also tasted bad, and many hard lumps formed inside. We usually call this strange smell "rancidity," which is chemically called rancidity of fats and oils. What causes rancidity of fats and oils?
    The chemical composition of fats and oils is mainly various fatty acids and glycerol. Many of these fatty acids easily absorb oxygen atoms and turn themselves into oxides. For example, tung oil, which is used to paint tables, chairs, and tarpaulins, contains a large amount of tung oil acid. As long as it is left in the air for half an hour, it can absorb oxygen and form a hard oxide film on its surface. The rancidity of fats and oils is related to this property.
    Generally, fats and oils are easily oxidized when exposed to moisture and light in the air. During oxidation, the fatty acids in the oil absorb an oxygen atom and then lose a molecule of carbon dioxide, turning into a ketone with a strong strange smell. This smell of ketone is what is usually called "rancidity." If the moisture in the air is high, the fatty acids in the oil will be hydrolyzed into aldehydes. Aldehydes also have the "rancid" smell we are talking about. It is especially easy to promote rancidity of fats and oils in high temperature and high humidity environments or when in contact with copper, iron, and other utensils.
    Since oxidation and hydrolysis are the causes of rancidity of fats and oils, the best way to preserve fats and oils for a long time without deterioration is to store them in a ventilated, dry place where they do not directly contact the air. For example, storing cod liver oil in a dark brown bottle and in a cool place, and keeping the lid tightly closed, is for this reason. In addition, a small amount of antioxidants, such as vitamin E, can be added to the oil. Because vitamin E itself is easily oxidized, this reduces the chance of oil oxidation. As for household cooking oil, as long as it is placed in a clean glass bottle, the stopper is tightly closed, and then sealed with wax and placed in a cool place, it can be kept for two or three months without spoiling. If it is lard, you can add some salt to prevent it from going bad. Remember not to use iron cans or copper pots as containers for oil, because with the help of copper or iron, even a small amount of oxygen is enough to spoil the oil.

### 油类放久了就有怪味

专栏：为什么？

    油类放久了就有怪味
    老祖母一年到头省吃俭用地积下一瓶花生油想等孙子回来过年时作点家乡菜给他吃，可是一打开油瓶的软木塞竟发出了一股难闻的怪味，油已经变坏了。老奶奶只是埋怨自己收藏不好，但是找不出油变坏的道理。
    生活中还有不少类似的例子：如一瓶润面香脂因为搁久了产生了怪味；一瓶鱼肝油吃了一半放置很久以后也变味了，而且里面生了许多硬块。平常我们叫这种怪味为“哈味”，在化学上称为油脂的酸败。什么原因引起油脂酸败的呢？
    油脂的化学成分主要是各种脂肪酸和甘油，其中的许多脂肪酸都很容易吸住氧原子把自己变成氧化物。比如用来油漆桌椅、雨布的桐油中含有大量的桐油酸，只要在空气中放上半小时就能吸住氧而在它的表面上结上一层硬的氧化膜。油脂的酸败，就是与它的这种性质有关。
    一般油脂在空气中受到水汽和光线的作用就很容易发生氧化作用。氧化时，油脂中的脂肪酸吸收一个氧再丢掉一分子二氧化碳而变为一种怪味很浓的酮。酮的这种味就是平常所说的“哈味”。如果空气中的水汽较大时，油脂中的脂肪酸就被水解为醛。醛也带有我们所说的“哈味”。尤其是在高温多水或者与铜、铁等器皿接触的时候更容易促进油脂酸败。
    既然氧化和水解是油脂酸败的原因，所以要想使油脂长期保藏不变质，最好的方法就是把油脂放在通风、干燥和不直接接触空气的地方。例如把鱼肝油保存在深棕色的瓶子里和放在阴凉处，并且把盖子盖紧，正是这个道理。另外还可以在油脂中加入少许防氧化剂，如维生素戊等。因为维生素戊本身易于氧化，这样就减少了油脂氧化的机会，至于家用的食油，只要放在干净的玻璃瓶中，将塞子盖紧，然后用蜡封严放在阴凉处，就可保持两、三个月不坏。如果是猪油，则可以放入一些食盐，也能防止变味。要切记不能用铁罐或铜壶作盛油用的器皿，因为有铜或铁的帮忙，即使只有少量的氧存在，也足以使油脂变坏。
