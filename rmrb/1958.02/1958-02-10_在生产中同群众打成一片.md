　　Integrating with the Masses in Production
　　Jing Yu

　　Party and mass cadres in grassroots production units participating in labor production, integrating with the masses in production, and promptly discovering and addressing problems is a good way to closely connect with the masses.

　　The main activity of the working masses in factories and mines is production, and the problems that the party and mass work of enterprises need to solve mainly revolve around various ideological and practical problems that arise around production activities. Only by discovering and solving these problems in a timely manner can we continuously promote the production enthusiasm of the working masses and develop production. However, in the past, many factories, in order to give the workshop branch secretaries enough time to do political and ideological work, adopted the method of separating them from production for full-time work. After some branch secretaries left production, the time for work was solved, but the bitterness of work increased. They found it difficult to work during production time, unable to get into the working masses, and afraid of affecting production if they did get in. After work, when the workers were off duty, they were busy listening to reports in the office. As a result, bureaucracy and subjectivism arose, and the masses had more and more opinions about the leadership.

　　Not long ago, many factories in Shanghai launched discussions on the issue of party and mass work in grassroots units. During the discussion, many people advocated reducing the number of full-time party and mass cadres in enterprises. Some also held a skeptical attitude, asking: In the past, when branch secretaries were not separated from production, they still did not do a good job; is it possible to not be full-time at all now? However, according to the experience of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2, reducing the number of full-time personnel in party and mass work and allowing workshop branch secretaries to return to their production posts not only works, but also works better than before. They were not familiar with the production situation in the past, but they became familiar with it as they personally participated in production activities; many things that were pushed to the branch secretary alone in the past are now shared by all branch committee members; problems were solved slowly in the past, but now they have become quick and timely.

　　Of course, separation from production does not necessarily mean separation from the masses. There are many full-time cadres in our production enterprises who are closely connected with the masses. However, due to the influence of the ideology of the exploiting classes, errors in working methods and ideological methods, or the imperfect reasonableness of institutions, there is also a danger of separation from the masses. Our country has many things that require the establishment of specialized institutions and the appointment of full-time personnel to be responsible for. Without such institutions, the work would not be done well. However, there are also some things that do not require the establishment of any specialized institutions and full-time personnel, or that require the establishment of such institutions but do not require the establishment of full-time personnel. Otherwise, it will only encourage bureaucracy.

　　The Party Central Committee has pointed out: The number of personnel separated from production in grassroots organizations in grassroots production units should be limited to the extent that is truly needed. The party, youth league, and trade union organizations of certain small and medium-sized enterprises should be prepared to gradually achieve a situation where there are no personnel completely separated from production. According to the existing experience of some factories, it is entirely possible and necessary to allow party cadres who are separated from production in workshops to return to their production posts. The question is whether the enterprise leaders are determined to take revolutionary measures to allow grassroots cadres to integrate with the masses in production.

### 在生产中同群众打成一片

　　在生产中同群众打成一片
　　静宇
    基层生产单位的党群干部参加劳动生产，在生产中同群众打成一片，及时地发现问题和处理问题，这是密切同群众联系的好办法。
    厂矿企业里工人群众的主要活动是生产活动，而企业的党群工作所要解决的问题，主要是围绕生产活动所发生的各种思想问题和实际问题。及时地发现和解决这些问题，才能不断地发扬工人群众的生产热情，发展生产。可是，过去有不少工厂为使车间支部书记有足够的时间做好政治思想工作，采取了脱离生产专职工作的办法。有些支部书记脱离生产以后，工作的时间解决了，而工作的苦闷却增加了。他们在生产的时间里很难进行工作，插不到工人群众中去，插进去又怕影响生产。下了班，工人放工了，他们又忙于在办公室听汇报。于是，官僚主义、主观主义由此产生，群众对领导的意见也越来越多。
    不久以前，上海有许多工厂对于基层单位的党群工作问题曾经展开讨论。在讨论过程中，很多人主张减少企业的党群脱产干部。也有人抱着怀疑的态度，提出：过去支部书记不脱离生产尚且没有搞好工作，现在完全不脱产行吗？但是，根据上海国棉二厂的经验，减少党群工作的脱产人员，让车间支部书记回到生产岗位上去，不仅能行，而且工作比过去做得更好了。过去不熟悉生产情况，随着亲身参加生产活动而熟悉了；过去许多推给支部书记一人办的事情，现在由支委委员大家分担了；过去解决问题迟缓，现在也变得迅速及时了。
    当然，并不是脱离生产就会脱离群众。我们的生产企业里有许多脱离生产的专职干部是密切联系群众的。但是由于剥削阶级的思想影响，由于工作方法和思想方法的错误，或者由于机构的不尽合理，也有产生脱离群众的危险。我们的国家有很多事情，需要设立专门机构、委任专职人员负责。如果没有这种机构，工作就不可能做好。但是，也有一些事情，不需要设立什么专门机构和专职人员，或者需要设立这样的机构，并不需要设立专职人员。否则，反而助长了官僚主义。
    党中央曾经指出：基层生产单位里基层组织脱离生产人员的数目，应限制在真正需要的范围内。某些中小企业的党、团、工会组织应当有准备地逐步做到没有完全脱离生产的人员。根据部分工厂已有的经验看来，让车间脱离生产的党的干部回到生产岗位上去是完全可能的，也是必要的。问题在于企业领导人员是否下决心采取革命的措施，让基层干部在生产中同群众打成一片。
