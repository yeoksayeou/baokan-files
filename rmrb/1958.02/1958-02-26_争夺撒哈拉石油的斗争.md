    The Algerian National Liberation Front is engaged in fierce battles with the French army in Algeria, while the Sahara Desert has become an invisible "second battlefield." The struggle on this battlefield is equally intense, but the participants and objectives are different.

    Since the news that the Sahara Desert possesses inexhaustible oil reserves spread throughout the world, oil companies have sent people to the region one after another. Not only Americans, but also British, Italians, and the French, the Sahara's "owners," not wanting to be left behind, are all trying to secure a share of this wealth. Thus, fierce competition between the relevant companies became inevitable.

    The French hurriedly established a semi-official, semi-private enterprise to be responsible for exploration work in the Sahara. The Moroccan government has made territorial claims on the western Sahara region, and the King has protested against the engineering work carried out by French exploration personnel and engineers. The King of Morocco, through the American oil company "Mobil Oil," has managed to cautiously remind the Paris government that Rabat (Note: Rabat is the capital of Morocco, here referring to the Moroccan government) may one day actually occupy the disputed part of the Sahara. At that time, the United States would not provide France with any assistance. This approach provides a convenient opening for American financial circles to penetrate French financial groups.

    However, developments do not stop there. The Italian National Petroleum Company (whose active manager, former Christian Democratic parliamentarian Mattei, once greatly disturbed the Western oil alliance due to his personal intervention in the Iranian oil issue) has also dealt with the King of Morocco. This company has already obtained drilling rights in "southern Morocco." However, everyone knows that the term "southern Morocco" is a very flexible term and can be said to be included within the territory of Western Sahara claimed by Rabat.

    Not long ago, Mattei surprisingly announced that "American Overseas Petroleum Company," through negotiations between the United States and the Libyan government, had obtained drilling rights for Italy in the eastern region of Libya, and a contract is about to be signed. Mattei also said, "Italy will do its utmost to safeguard its oil interests in the Mediterranean and the Near East at the appropriate time." Given this situation, surprising things are bound to happen in the future. From this, it can be seen that the European Economic Cooperation Bureau's proposal aimed at avoiding a deadlock in the event of a crisis similar to Suez has very little hope of being realized. Therefore, there is reason to ask the following question: Should the series of attacks carried out by the so-called "Southern Liberation Army" forces in Morocco be attributed to the activities of competing oil companies?

### 争夺撒哈拉石油的斗争

    争夺撒哈拉石油的斗争
    （原载巴黎“国际论坛”周刊）
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线同法国军队正在阿尔及利亚进行着激烈的战斗，而撒哈拉沙漠却成了无形的“第二战场”了。这个战场上的斗争是同样激烈的，只是斗争的参加者和目的有所不同。
    自从撒哈拉大沙漠拥有取之不尽的石油蕴藏的消息传遍世界以来，各石油公司就纷纷派人到这个地区去。不仅有美国人，而且还有英国人、意大利人和不落于人后的撒哈拉“所有主”法国人，都试图确保占有这一财富。于是，各有关公司之间的激烈斗争就成为不可避免。
    法国人急忙建立了一个半官方半私人的企业，负责在撒哈拉进行钻探工作。摩洛哥政府已就撒哈拉西部地区提出领土要求，国王则抗议法国的勘探人员和工程师们所进行的工程。摩洛哥国王通过美国石油公司“美孚油公司”，已经做到促使美国谨慎地提醒巴黎政府注意：拉巴特（注：拉巴特是摩洛哥首都，这里指摩洛哥政府）有朝一日可能在事实上占有撒哈拉引起争端的那部分地区。那时，美国就不会给予法国以任何援助。这种做法足以为美国金融界打入法国财团大开方便之门。
    但是，事态发展还不止此。意大利国家石油公司（这个公司的善于活动的经理、前天主教民主党议员马太伊，曾由于他个人干预伊朗石油问题而使西方石油界联盟大受波动）也同摩洛哥国王打了交道。这个公司已经获得在“摩洛哥南部”的钻探权。然而谁都知道，所谓“摩洛哥南部”是很有伸缩性的一个提法，可以说是被包括在拉巴特所要求的西撒哈拉领土之内的。
    不久以前，马太伊令人吃惊地宣布：“美国海外石油公司”已经在美国同利比亚政府交涉之下，为意大利在利比亚东部地区取得了钻探权，并即将签订合同。马太伊又说：“意大利将在适当时机竭尽全力维护自己在地中海和近东的石油利益”。情况既然如此，以后势必会发生令人吃惊的事情。由此可见，欧洲经济合作局提出的旨在一旦发生类似苏伊士的危机时避免陷入僵局的石油联营建议，有多少实现的希望，是极其令人怀疑的。因此有理由提出如下的问题：是不是应该把所谓“南部解放军”部队在摩洛哥进行的一系列的攻击，归源于互相竞争的各石油公司的活动。
