　　Grain Should Be Threshed Cleanly

　　The Beijing Third Mat and Reed Screen Production Cooperative recently purchased 130,000 jin of rice straw from Yangzhuangzi Agricultural Cooperative in Liangxiang County, Hebei Province. From the 80,000 jin of rice straw received so far, there are still many unthreshed grains. On a bundle of straw weighing about two or three jin, there is at least one or two liang of grain. The cooperative produces more than 7,000 jin of reed screens every day, and can sift out more than 30 jin of rice from sweeping the floor alone. Two members of the Mat and Reed Screen Production Cooperative sifted out more than 300 jin in a week to save grain. The Mat and Reed Screen Production Cooperative has repeatedly made suggestions to the Yangzhuangzi Agricultural Cooperative, but the agricultural cooperative has not paid attention to them. The rice straw received recently still has a lot of grain. If this continues, 130,000 jin of rice straw will lose six or seven thousand jin of grain. Therefore, I hope that farmer brothers will pay more attention, thresh the grain cleanly, and ensure that every grain returns home.

　　粮食应当打干净
    北京市第三席箔生产合作社最近从河北省良乡县杨庄子农业社购买了十三万斤稻草，从目前收到的八万斤稻草来看，未打净的谷粒还很多；一捆约二、三斤重的稻草上，最少有一、二两谷，全社每天生产七千多斤草帘子，只从扫地中就可以筛出三十多斤稻谷来。席箔社两个社员为了节约粮食，一个星期的时间筛出了三百多斤。席箔生产社曾多次给杨庄子农业社提过意见，但该社一直没有重视起来，最近收到的稻草上仍然有许多谷。如果这样下去，十三万斤稻草就要损失六、七千斤粮食。所以，希望农民兄弟多加注意，打粮食要打干净，做到颗粒还家。
