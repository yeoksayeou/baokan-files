The current evolution of the world situation presents a stark contrast: the growing decline and disintegration of imperialist rule versus the vigorous development of the international communist movement and the national independence movements of oppressed peoples, and the increasing solidarity and friendly cooperation between these two progressive movements. The rise of these two revolutionary movements is the result of the collapse of international imperialism’s rule on two fronts – the oppression of its own proletariat and the oppression of colonies and dependent countries – and is the inevitable result of the action of objective laws of historical development.

Of these two nascent forces, the dominant one, and therefore the one that plays a decisive role in the course of world events, is the socialist force of the world proletariat. Lenin said: “The individual demands of the democratic movement, including national self-determination, are not absolute, but are part of the general democratic (now general socialist) world movement.” (Summary of the Discussion on the Question of Self-Determination, July 1916) This means that the independence movement of oppressed nations has always been subordinate to the entire world revolutionary movement in an objective sense. In the era of bourgeois democratic revolution, it was part of the world democratic movement; in the era of the proletarian socialist revolution, it cannot but become part of the world socialist movement in an objective sense. In modern historical conditions, due to the powerful oppression of international imperialism, the independence movement of oppressed nations cannot achieve victory without the support and assistance of the world proletarian socialist revolutionary movement, which inevitably leads to the tendency for the independence movement of oppressed nations to approach and unite with the world socialist revolutionary movement, thereby making the independence movement of oppressed nations a reserve and support force for the socialist revolutionary movement.

The history of modern national independence movements in colonies and dependent countries fully proves the correctness of Lenin's above-mentioned thesis. As everyone knows, the national independence movements in colonies and dependent countries gradually began as early as the beginning of the 20th century or even earlier. However, it was only after the October Revolution in Russia, under the influence and support of the continuously victorious international communist movement, that it developed rapidly on an unprecedented scale, and after World War II, it achieved broad victories in two directions.

The two development directions or types of national independence movements in colonies and dependent countries are due to the formation of different class force comparisons in the process of oppressed nations striving for liberation. One type is China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, totaling more than 600 million people, which, under the leadership of the proletariat and communists, achieved thorough national liberation and embarked on the road of socialist development. The other type includes more than twenty countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Egypt, and Syria, totaling more than 700 million people, which, under the leadership of bourgeois nationalists, achieved political independence and embarked on the road of independently developing their national economies, that is, developing national capitalism.

The two different types of national independence movements in colonies and dependent countries naturally produced different consequences. After their revolutionary victories, China, Korea, and Vietnam have become important components of the socialist world system headed by the Soviet Union. India, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries have formed the "Asian-African Group" of nationalist countries. However, the victory of either the former or the latter type of national liberation movement is a serious blow to imperialist colonialism, either directly or objectively becoming a component of the world socialist movement.

A change of great historical significance that occurred after World War II is that Western imperialist countries have lost their original rule over most of the Eastern colonies and dependent countries. Before World War II, the population living in colonies and dependent countries totaled 1.5 billion, but now, only about 150 million people remain in formal colonial and dependent status. This means that imperialism's original rule over colonies and dependent countries has irrevocably collapsed. The era predicted by Lenin, in which the oppressed nations of the East would participate in determining the fate of mankind, has indeed arrived.

The widespread victory of national independence movements in colonies and dependent countries was won by the people of all oppressed nations through long-term and tenacious struggles against imperialist countries with the support and cooperation of the international communist movement. Taking the old colonial countries that have already achieved political independence as an example, their achievement of independence generally has two different situations. One situation, such as Indonesia and Egypt, achieved independence through national revolution and bloodshed. The other situation, such as India, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, etc., achieved national independence because the national independence movement had a strong development, and the imperialist countries were forced to make political concessions in order to maintain their economic interests in these countries as much as possible. In both of the above-mentioned situations, the imperialist countries withdrew their original political ruling forces from the colonies and dependent countries only because they were forced to withdraw. After World War II, the Netherlands' withdrawal from Indonesia, France's withdrawal from Indochina and a series of colonies and dependent countries in West Asia and North Africa, and Britain's withdrawal from India, Burma, Egypt, and a series of other colonies and dependent countries were all, obviously, only because they had to withdraw. Dulles said not long ago at the NATO summit that Western countries voluntarily gave 800 million people independent status, which is nothing more than the most despicable and shameless deception that can only make people nauseous.

A novel international phenomenon that has emerged after World War II, especially in recent years, is that socialist countries and nationalist countries have developed remarkably effective friendly cooperation on the basis of the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence). In April 1954, China and India confirmed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guiding principles in their relations in the agreement signed on trade and communication between China's Tibet region and India; Comrade Zhou Enlai's visits to India and Burma in June and July of the same year, and the joint communiques of China and India, and China and Burma; the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries in the spring of 1955; Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the summer of the same year, and the Soviet-Indian joint communique; the visits of Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin to India, Burma, and Afghanistan at the end of 1955; these are some important milestones in the development of the above-mentioned peaceful cooperative relations. These facts show the positive and friendly cooperation policy adopted by China, the Soviet Union, and various socialist countries towards the newly independent old colonial countries, and at the same time show the correctness and effectiveness of this policy.

Imperialist colonialists are trying to hinder and undermine the friendly cooperation between socialist countries and nationalist countries because they fear that this friendly cooperation between the two "Eastern blocs" will further strengthen the national independence movements of colonies and dependent countries and the strength of the international communist movement. However, the imperialists' conspiracy of obstruction and sabotage will not succeed because this cooperation is based on objective and important common interests, is entirely in the interests of both parties, and has broad prospects for development. Conversely, the contradiction between the imperialist countries' policy of attempting to re-invade and enslave nationalist countries and the fundamental interests of these countries in demanding national independence and autonomous development of their national economies is antagonistic and irreconcilable.

In his essay "Better Fewer, But Better" written before his death, Lenin said: On our part, there is also such a shortcoming, that "hundreds of millions of the exploited people in the entire East, living almost inhuman lives, have fallen into such a situation that all their physical and material strength cannot be compared with the physical, material, and military strength of any much smaller country in Western Europe." Lenin pointed out in many essays that the oppressed nations of the East can only break free from the rule of international imperialism by uniting with the Western proletarian revolutionary movement. In the above-mentioned essay, he concluded: "The outcome of the struggle depends, in the final analysis, on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc. constitute the vast majority of the world's population. It is precisely this majority of the world's population that has been involved very rapidly in the struggle for its own liberation in recent years, so in this sense, there can be no slightest doubt about the final solution of the world struggle question. So in this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed." The great Lenin's brilliant idea of the mutual union of the proletarian socialist movement and the oppressed national liberation movement in order to transform the whole world is the most precious will he left to the world's proletariat and oppressed nations.

The people of oppressed countries that have already achieved independence and are still fighting for independence have personally seen and experienced that although they are much weaker in physical, material, and military strength compared with Western imperialist countries, as long as they unite themselves, as long as they form an alliance with the socialist countries and the proletariat of Western countries, then the colonial shackles around their necks can be smashed. The colonialists of Britain, France, and the Netherlands had to withdraw from many colonies and dependent countries in Asia and Africa precisely because they were subjected to the dual blows of socialist forces and anti-colonialist nationalist forces.

Not only that, but the people of oppressed countries have also personally experienced that the powerful socialist camp and the international communist movement are their most reliable friends in striving for and defending their national independence. Imperialists are trying to suppress the development of national independence movements and put colonial shackles on these countries again in new forms. This has created a constant, repeated, and complex sharp struggle between imperialist countries and oppressed nations. However, due to the unity and resistance of these countries themselves, especially due to the support of the powerful socialist camp and the sympathy of the proletariat of Western countries, the above-mentioned attempts of imperialism cannot succeed. The failure of Britain, France, and Israel's invasion of Egypt in November 1956, and the failure of the long-planned attack on Syria by the United States and Turkey in the autumn of 1957, are two of the most prominent proofs that imperialists cannot stop the development of national independence movements no matter what. In these two incidents, the stern warning issued by the Soviet Union, the world's most powerful socialist country, to the aggressors played a major role in the victory of Egypt and Syria's anti-aggression struggle.

The Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, within their capabilities, provide many nationalist countries with economic assistance without any political conditions, and the equal economic cooperation between these countries and socialist countries promotes the development of the national economies of these countries. All of the above clearly shows that the powerful development of the international communist movement and the policy of friendly cooperation between nationalist countries and socialist countries are entirely in line with the fundamental interests of these countries in striving for and defending national independence.

Throughout the post-war period, the national independence movements of colonies and dependent countries have achieved new victories almost every year. In the past few years, the anti-colonialist struggles of colonies and dependent countries have formed a historically unprecedented and ever-increasing great climax. The Bandung Conference in 1955, attended by government representatives from twenty-nine Asian and African countries, gave a new and great impetus to the anti-colonialist struggles of Asian and African countries in the spirit of strengthening mutual solidarity among Asian and African countries and developing friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries and socialist countries. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of 1957, attended by people's representatives from nearly fifty countries and regions, is another vivid proof of the further development of the independence movement of oppressed nations in Asia and Africa in recent years.

As the declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries pointed out: "Due to the disintegration of the colonial system, the imperialist positions have been greatly weakened." But at the same time, "The US imperialist aggressive group is trying to rule most countries in the world by relying on the so-called 'position of strength' policy, and is hindering mankind from moving forward in accordance with the laws of social development. Under the guise of 'anti-communism,' they are trying to eliminate democratic freedom, threaten the national independence of developed capitalist countries, and want to put the colonial shackles back on the people who have already been liberated in new forms."

In the post-war period, US imperialism has become the most ferocious enemy of the oppressed nations seeking liberation. It not only insists on and further intensifies its semi-colonial rule over Latin American countries, strangling the national independence and democratic development of these countries; it not only tries its best to support the old colonial imperialist countries in their oppression of colonies and dependent countries, but also tries to invade and control the newly independent Asian and African nationalist countries, and also invades and controls many developed capitalist countries in the world, actually turning these countries into semi-colonies and semi-dependent countries. The US imperialist policy of preparing for a new war has created a turbulent situation and war danger in Europe, West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. At the same time, old colonial countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands, after being forced to withdraw from many old colonies, are still trying to maintain their economic and political colonialist forces in these countries, and still refuse to recognize the independent rights of many colonies and dependent countries. They collude with US imperialism to suppress national independence movements. On the other hand, they are also engaged in open and secret struggles with the United States for colonies and spheres of influence. It is precisely because of this that the 600 million people who are still in colonial status and actual semi-dependent status, as well as the more than 700 million people of the old colonial countries that have already achieved political independence, cannot but fight for and defend their national independence or complete independence, and for economic autonomy and international peace.

In countries that have already achieved independence and are still fighting for independence, broad social strata, including workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements, are on the side of opposing imperialism, advocating maintaining peace, and developing peaceful cooperation with socialist countries, and the communists of these countries stand at the forefront of the national democratic movement. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries said: "The communist and workers' parties are the loyal defenders of the national and democratic interests of the people of all countries. In many countries, the working class and the entire people are still faced with the historical task of fighting for national independence, against colonial aggression and feudal oppression. In these countries, it is necessary to establish an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal united front of workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic forces. Countless facts prove that the more extensive and solid the unity of various patriotic and democratic forces, the more confident their joint struggle will be to achieve victory."

Although there will still be difficulties and twists and turns in the struggle of the people of various oppressed countries for and defending national independence, democracy, and social progress, because this struggle has already achieved great victories, because the people's awareness and unity have been unprecedentedly enhanced and strengthened, because the socialist forces have overwhelmed the imperialist forces on a worldwide scale, because the friendly cooperation between the socialist forces and the national independence movement is developing day by day, we can believe that this struggle will achieve greater victories in the future.

　　民族独立运动的高涨
　　廖盖隆
    在当前世界形势演变中，同帝国主义的统治日益衰落下去和日益分崩离析形成尖锐对照的，是国际共产主义运动和被压迫民族独立运动的蓬勃发展和这两个进步运动之间的团结和友好合作的日益加强。这两个革命运动的兴起，是国际帝国主义的统治在两个战线上，即在压迫本国无产阶级的战线上和在压迫殖民地和附属国的战线上陷于崩溃的结果，是客观的历史发展规律发生作用的必然结果。
    在这两个新生的力量中，占主导地位、因而对世界事变进程起决定作用的是世界无产阶级的社会主义力量。列宁说：“民主主义运动的个别要求，包括民族自决在内，并不是什么绝对的东西，而是一般民主主义（现在是一般社会主义）世界运动中的一部分。”（1916年7月作“自决问题讨论的总结”）这就是说，被压迫民族的独立运动，在客观上始终都是从属于整个世界革命运动的。在资产阶级民主革命时代，它是世界民主主义运动的一部分；在无产阶级社会主义革命时代，它在客观上就不能不成为世界社会主义运动的一部分。在现代的历史条件下，由于国际帝国主义的强大的压迫，被压迫民族的独立运动如果没有世界无产阶级社会主义革命运动的支持和援助，是不可能取得胜利的，这样就必然产生被压迫民族独立运动和世界社会主义革命运动接近起来和联合起来的趋向，从而使被压迫民族独立运动成为社会主义革命运动的后备军和支援力量。
    现代殖民地和附属国民族独立运动的历史，充分证明了列宁的上述论断的正确。大家知道，殖民地和附属国的民族独立运动，早在二十世纪初叶甚至更早的时期就逐步地开始了，但是，只是在俄国十月革命以后，在不断取得胜利的国际共产主义运动的影响和支持之下，它才以空前的规模迅速地发展起来，并且在第二次大战以后，沿着两个方向取得了广泛的胜利。
    殖民地和附属国民族独立运动的两个发展方向或者说两种类型，是由于被压迫民族在争取解放的过程中形成了不同的阶级力量对比关系而产生的。一种类型是中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国，共计有六亿多人口，在无产阶级共产主义者的领导下实现了彻底的民族解放，走上了社会主义的发展道路；另一种类型就是印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚等等二十多个国家，共计有七亿多人口，在资产阶级民族主义者的领导下取得了政治独立，走上了自主地发展民族经济，即发展民族资本主义的道路。
    殖民地和附属国民族独立运动的两种不同的类型，当然产生了不同的后果。中国、朝鲜和越南在革命胜利后，已经成为了以苏联为首的社会主义世界体系的重要的组成部分。而印度、印度尼西亚、埃及等等国家则组成了民族主义国家的“亚非集团”。但是，无论是前一种类型或者是后一种类型的民族解放运动的胜利，都是对于帝国主义殖民主义统治的严重的打击，或者直接地或者在客观上成为了世界社会主义运动的一个组成部分。
    第二次世界大战后所产生的一个具有伟大历史意义的变化，就是西方帝国主义国家已经丧失了它们对于大多数东方殖民地和附属国的原有统治。第二次大战前，居住在殖民地和附属国的人口共有十五亿，但是现在，仍然处在正式的殖民地和附属国地位的，已经是只有大约一亿五千万人了。这就是说，帝国主义对于殖民地和附属国的原有统治，已经不可挽回地陷于崩溃了。列宁所预见的，由东方各被压迫民族参与决定世界人类命运的时期，现在已经确实到来了。
    殖民地和附属国民族独立运动的广泛的胜利，是各被压迫民族的人民大众在国际共产主义运动的支持和配合之下，向帝国主义国家进行了长期的、顽强的斗争而争得的。拿已经取得政治独立的旧殖民地国家来说，它们的取得独立，大体上有两种不同的情况。一种情况，例如印度尼西亚、埃及这些国家，是经过民族革命和流血冲突才取得独立的。另一种情况，例如印度、苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯等等这些国家，是由于民族独立运动有了强大的发展，帝国主义国家为了尽可能保持自己在这些国家的经济利益而被迫作政治上的让步，因而取得了民族独立的。帝国主义国家所以从殖民地和附属国撤出自己原有的政治统治力量，在上述两种情况下都是，而且只是被迫的。在第二次大战后，荷兰从印度尼西亚的撤退，法国从印度支那和西亚、北非一系列殖民地和附属国的撤退，以及英国从印度、缅甸、埃及和其他一系列殖民地和附属国的撤退，显而易见，都只是因为他们不得不撤退。杜勒斯不久以前在北大西洋集团首脑会议上，说什么西方国家自愿地给予了八亿人民以独立的地位，这不过是最卑鄙无耻的、只会使人作呕不止的欺骗。
    第二次大战后，特别是最近几年来出现的一个新颖的国际现象，就是社会主义国家和民族主义国家在著名的和平共处五项原则（互相尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处）的基础上，发展了卓著成效的友好合作。1954年4月间中印两国在所签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中，确认和平共处五项原则是两国关系中的指导原则；同年6、7月间周恩来同志访问印度和缅甸，和中印、中缅的联合声明；1955年春天的亚非国家万隆会议；同年夏天尼赫鲁访问苏联和其他社会主义国家，和苏印联合声明；1955年底赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗；这些就是上述和平合作关系发展中的一些重要的里程碑。这些事实表明了中国、苏联和各社会主义国家对于新近取得独立的旧殖民地国家所采取的积极的友好合作政策，同时表明了这种政策的正确和有效。
    帝国主义殖民主义者力图阻挠和破坏社会主义国家和民族主义国家之间的友好合作，因为它们害怕两个“东方集团”之间的这种友好合作会进一步地加强殖民地和附属国的民族独立运动和国际共产主义运动的力量。但是帝国主义者的这种阻挠和破坏的阴谋是不会得逞的，因为这种合作是以客观的重要的共同利益为基础的，是完全符合于双方的利益的，是有宽广的发展前途的。相反地，帝国主义国家企图重新侵入和奴役民族主义国家的政策同这些国家要求民族独立和自主地发展民族经济的根本利益之间的矛盾，则是对抗性的、不可调和的。
    列宁在他逝世以前所写的题为“宁肯少些，但要好些”的论文中说过：我们方面也有这样的短处，就是“整个东方若干万万被剥削得几乎过着非人生活的劳动人民，已经陷入这样的境地，就是他们的所有的体力和物力都决不能去与西欧任何一个要小得多的国家的体力、物力和武力作任何比拟”。列宁在许多论文中都指出过，东方各被压迫民族只有同西方无产阶级革命运动联合起来，才能挣脱国际帝国主义的统治。他在上述论文中作出结论说：“斗争的结局，归根结底是取决于俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形。正是这世界人口的大多数，最近几年来非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上讲来，关于世界斗争问题底最终解决，不能有丝毫的怀疑。所以在这个意义上讲来，社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有保证的。”伟大的列宁关于无产阶级社会主义运动和被压迫民族解放运动互相联合起来、以便改造全世界的这个光辉的思想，就是他留给世界无产阶级和被压迫民族的最珍贵的遗嘱。
    已经取得独立和还在为独立而斗争的被压迫国家的人民都亲自看到和亲自体验到，尽管它们自己同西方帝国主义国家比较起来，在体力、物力和武力上都弱得多，但是，只要它们自己团结起来，只要它们同社会主义国家和西方国家的无产阶级结成联盟，那么它们颈项上的殖民主义的枷锁是可以粉碎的。英国、法国和荷兰的殖民主义者所以不得不从亚非两洲的许多殖民地和附属国撤退，就正是因为它们受到了社会主义力量和反对殖民主义的民族主义力量双重打击的原故。
    不仅如此，被压迫国家的人民还亲自体验到，强大的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动是它们争取和保卫自己的民族独立的最可靠的朋友。帝国主义者力图镇压民族独立运动的发展，用新的形式把殖民主义的枷锁重新套在这些国家的头上。这样就造成了帝国主义国家和被压迫民族之间的不断的、反复的和复杂尖锐的斗争。但是，由于这些国家自己的团结反抗，特别是由于它们有强大的社会主义阵营的支持和西方国家无产阶级的同情，帝国主义的上述企图都不能得逞。1956年11月英、法和以色列侵略埃及的失败，以及1957年秋天美国和土耳其策划了很久的对叙利亚的进攻的未能实现，就是帝国主义者无论如何都阻止不了民族独立运动发展的两个最显著的证明。在这两个事件中，世界上最强大的社会主义国家苏联对侵略者所提出的严厉的警告，对于埃及和叙利亚反侵略斗争的胜利，起了主要的作用。
    苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家在自己力所能及的范围内，给予许多民族主义国家以不附带任何政治条件的经济援助，和这些国家同社会主义国家之间的平等的经济合作，促进了这些国家民族经济的发展。以上这些清楚地表明了，国际共产主义运动的强大发展，和民族主义国家同社会主义国家实行友好合作的政策，是完全符合于这些国家争取和保卫民族独立的根本利益的。
    在整个战后时期中，殖民地和附属国的民族独立运动几乎每一年都获得了新的胜利。在过去几年中，殖民地和附属国的反殖民主义斗争，形成了历史上从来没有过的、日益增强的伟大高潮。1955年有二十九个亚非国家的政府代表参加的万隆会议，以加强亚非各国相互间的团结和发展亚非国家同社会主义国家的友好合作的精神，给了亚非各国的反殖民主义斗争以新的伟大的推动力量。1957年年底在开罗举行的有将近五十个国家和地区的人民代表参加的亚非人民团结大会，是被压迫民族独立运动几年来在亚非两大洲有了进一步发展的又一个生动的证明。
    正如社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言所指出：“由于殖民主义体系的瓦解，帝国主义的阵地已经大大地削弱了。”但是与此同时，“美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓‘实力地位’政策统治世界上的大多数国家，并且阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。它们打着‘反共’的幌子，力图消灭民主自由，威胁发达的资本主义国家的民族独立，想要以新的形式给已经解放了的人民重新套上殖民枷锁”。
    美帝国主义在战后时期，成为了求解放的被压迫民族的最凶恶的敌人。它不仅坚持和进一步加紧了对拉丁美洲各国的半殖民主义的统治，扼杀这些国家的民族独立和民主的发展；它不仅竭力支持旧的殖民帝国主义国家对于殖民地和附属国的压迫，同时力图侵入和控制新近取得独立的亚非民族主义国家，而且侵入和控制了世界上的许多发达的资本主义国家，实际上把这些国家变成了半殖民地和半附属国。美帝国主义所推行的准备新战争的政策，在欧洲、西亚、北非和东南亚地区，造成了动荡不安的局势和战争危险。与此同时，英、法、荷兰等旧的殖民主义国家，在被迫从许多旧殖民地撤出之后，仍然力图保持在这些国家的经济上和政治上的殖民主义势力，并且仍然拒绝承认许多殖民地和附属国的独立权利。它们同美帝国主义勾结起来镇压民族独立运动。另一方面又同美国展开争夺殖民地和势力范围的明争暗斗，正是因为这样，仍然处在殖民地地位和实际上的半从属国地位的六亿人民，以及已经取得了政治独立的旧殖民地国家的七亿多人民，不能不为争取和捍卫自己的民族独立或者完全独立，并且为经济上的自主和国际间的和平而斗争。
    在已经取得独立和还在为争取独立而斗争的国家里，广大的社会阶层，包括工人、农民、城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和其他爱国民主分子，都是站在反对帝国主义、主张维护和平和发展同社会主义国家的和平合作方面的，而这些国家的共产党人则站在民族民主运动的最前列。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言说：“共产党和工人党是各国人民的民族利益和民主利益的忠诚的捍卫者。在许多国家中，工人阶级和全体人民还面临着争取民族独立、反对殖民主义侵略和封建主义压迫的历史任务。在这些国家里，有必要建立工人、农民、城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级以及其他爱国民主力量的反帝反封建统一战线。无数的事实证明，各种爱国民主力量团结得越广泛越巩固，他们的共同斗争就越有把握取得胜利。”
    尽管在各被压迫国家人民争取和保卫民族独立、民主和社会进步的斗争中，还会有困难和曲折，但是，由于这个斗争已经取得了巨大的胜利，由于人民的觉悟和团结已经空前提高和加强，由于在全世界范围内社会主义的力量已经压倒了帝国主义的力量，由于社会主义力量和民族独立运动的力量的友好合作正在日益发展，我们可以相信，这个斗争在今后必将取得更大的胜利。
