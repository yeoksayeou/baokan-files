    JCP Issues Statement
    Accusing Government of Plotting to Persecute the JCP
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 25th: The "Akahata" newspaper published a statement from the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). The reason for the statement was that Justice Minister Toshiki Karasawa and Director-General of the Public Security Investigation Agency Goichiro Fujii, in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, accused the Japanese Communist Party and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan of violating the so-called Subversive Activities Prevention Act.
    The statement pointed out that this accusation proves that the government is systematically attacking the Japanese Communist Party, the advanced force of the Japanese working class, in order to isolate the Communist Party from the people. The statement said that the Communist Party will not allow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to realize its plot.
    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that the Socialist Party has decided to raise questions in the Diet regarding the aforementioned remarks by Toshiki Karasawa and Goichiro Fujii. The Japanese Communist Party will, together with the Socialist Party, unyieldingly expose the reactionary plot of the Nobusuke Kishi government and cooperate with all democratic forces in the country to abolish the anti-democratic Subversive Activities Prevention Act, demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the dissolution of the Diet.

    日共发表声明
    指责政府图谋迫害日共
    据新华社25日讯　塔斯社东京25日讯：“赤旗报”发表了日本共产党中央常任干部会的声明，发表声明的原因是：法务相唐泽俊树和公安调查厅长官藤井五一郎在众议院预算委员会中指责日本共产党和旅日朝鲜人总联合会违反所谓防止破坏活动法。
    声明指出，这种指责证明政府在有计划地向日本工人阶级的先进队伍日本共产党进攻，要使共产党与人民隔绝。声明说，共产党不会让岸信介内阁实现它的图谋。
    日本共产党中央常任干部会指出，社会党已经决定就唐泽俊树和藤井五一郎的上述言论在国会中提出质询，日本共产党将同社会党一起不屈不挠地揭穿岸信介政府的反动图谋，并且同全国所有民主力量合作，争取废除反民主的防止破坏活动法，要岸信介政府辞职并解散国会。
