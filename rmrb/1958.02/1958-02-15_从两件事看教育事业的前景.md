Seeing the Prospects of Education from Two Events
Wang Di

How can we run socialist education well? What kind of people should the younger generation be cultivated into? Can the education cause achieve a great leap forward, and how? Around this series of questions, a sharp struggle between two roads and two lines is currently underway on the education front.

With the entire socialist great leap forward, revolutionary changes are bound to occur in the education cause, and a great leap forward should also occur. How should we understand the essence of this great leap forward? From the current state of education, the most fundamental issue should be: with a revolutionary spirit, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy of cultivating laborers, and under the premise of building the country and running schools diligently and thriftily, also achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" in education. Spend less money, run more schools, and run them well.

But there are some "educators" who are always filled with endless worries, thinking that "other causes can leap forward, but education cannot," and "to run schools, you need money," and reach out to the state everywhere. They attempt to seek a path to "improve the quality of education" with a "closed-door schooling" approach that is divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. The result is contrary to their wishes, and they go further and further astray.

In 1957, two events occurred in the education cause in Henan, which aroused great interest and attention from all sides: one was the emergence of the advanced example of Changge No. 3 Middle School combining education and labor (see the front page of the People's Daily on January 20); the other was the development of 1,560 non-governmental middle schools across the province within a year. These vivid facts embody the fundamental principles of socialist schooling and open up a path forward for the great leap forward in socialist education.

Changge No. 3 Middle School in Henan has persisted in running schools diligently and thriftily for eight years, and has persisted in production labor education for three years. With the distinct characteristics of socialist education, it demonstrates the fundamental differences with bourgeois education ideology in the following three main aspects: First, it adheres to the class line of opening education to workers and peasants. Among the 950 students in the school, 773 are children of middle and poor peasants (excluding well-to-do middle peasants), accounting for 81.3%. This is a school that truly opens its doors to workers and peasants. Education has always served politics. Today, it is perfectly normal for workers' and peasants' children to account for such a proportion in an ordinary middle school; second, it adheres to the mass line of running schools diligently and thriftily. Spending less money and accomplishing more is the school's fine tradition. In 1952, the government allocated funds for the construction of three classrooms for the first time. They completed the task themselves and expanded ten more thatched houses. The second time, they used the funds originally intended to build eighty-one rooms and built one hundred and five rooms. The school's roads were built by themselves, the playground was leveled by themselves, the walls were built by themselves, and the campus and toilets were all cleaned by the students themselves. Male students cut their own hair and milled rice, and female students sewed and washed their own clothes. In the summer vacation of 1957, 606 people returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, with an average labor income of 30 yuan per person, which solved many practical difficulties. Originally, 549 students in the school received scholarships, but now it has dropped to 324. The students used work-study programs to reduce the economic burden on the state and their families; third, it adheres to the socialist education line of combining education and labor, theory and practice. In this school, production labor has become a compulsory course for students and has been put on the agenda of the teaching plan. At present, most of the students in the school can master certain production knowledge and production skills. According to the statistics of more than 600 people in the second and third grades: 593 people have learned how to hoe, 249 people have learned how to harrow, 378 people have learned how to plow, 70 people have learned how to sow, 195 people have learned how to winnow, and many people have learned how to use sprayers and prepare liquid chemical fertilizers. Now, the school has made a comprehensive plan for students' production labor education: after new students enter the school, in addition to strengthening ideological education, they will first learn to store sweet potatoes in the first semester by connecting with the sweet potato fields of the graduating class; in the second semester, they will mainly learn to plant corn; in the third semester, they will mainly learn to plant wheat; in the fourth semester, they will learn intercropping of corn and soybeans; in the fifth semester, they will learn to plant wheat again; and in the sixth semester, they will learn to plant sweet potatoes. In this way, during the three years from enrollment to graduation, a student can effectively master the production knowledge of several major crops and learn some basic production techniques. Arm the students with practical production skills so that they are always ready to serve as "new soldiers" on the labor front.

People worry: this will disrupt the "normal order" of the school and "reduce the quality of education." There is a question that must be clarified here: what standards should be used to measure the normal order and quality of education in schools? Obviously, it should be socialist standards, that is, the Party's education policy. Can the serious situation in recent years where many school graduates despise labor, are unwilling to produce, and cannot produce be called a "normal order" in education? The facts are very clear that what affects the normal order and quality of education in schools is none other than the bourgeois education ideology at work.

Changge No. 3 Middle School has reaped a bountiful harvest in education because it has correctly implemented the Party's education policy, organized labor practice, and launched a struggle against the harmful tendency of "three separations" (separation from politics, separation from production, separation from reality). In 1957, the school graduated a total of 295 students, of which 75 were admitted to higher education, with an admission rate of 25%, while the average admission rate of schools in Xuchang Prefecture during the same period was only 15%. It can be seen that the students' academic performance has not decreased but has been learned better and more solidly. Looking at the 220 graduates who returned to their hometowns to participate in production last year, they performed very well in labor, and many have achieved "three satisfactions": the commune is satisfied, the masses are satisfied, and the family is satisfied. Now, 53 people have been rated as various model and outstanding commune members, and the masses praise the students of Changge No. 3 Middle School as people who "can write with a pen and work with a hoe." The implementation of production labor education has also promoted the all-round growth of students' communist moral character. Last year, 15 townships in the county were hit by disasters, involving 11 townships in the families of students in the school, but the students' thinking was very stable. They were able to listen to the Party and find ways to overcome difficulties in times of difficulty, showing the collective spirit of unity and mutual assistance and the revolutionary will of not fearing difficulties. The training of production labor not only enabled them to learn skills and transform their thinking, but also strengthened their physique. Last year, in the county sports meeting, they won 21 championships in 35 events.

For three years, the experience of Changge No. 3 Middle School has concentratedly proved one point: breaking through the link between education and separation from production can promote the comprehensive reform and improvement of education and promote the leap forward of school education along the socialist track to new heights.

The great leap forward of socialist education, under the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily and running schools diligently and thriftily, must both improve and popularize; it must both not increase the burden on the state and continuously meet the cultural requirements of the masses, and facilitate the children of working people to have more opportunities to attend school. So, what path should we take? Now it seems that we must take the path of running schools diligently and thriftily, work-study programs, and part-work and part-study, allowing schools to be both formal and informal. We must vigorously implement the mass line, boldly mobilize the masses, and solve problems ourselves.

Looking at the historical development of ordinary middle schools in Henan, there were only 111 ordinary middle schools in the province in 1949. In 1955, it developed to 353. In 1956, the method of "wearing a hat" (adding junior middle school classes to primary schools) was adopted, and the number of middle schools developed to 846 within a year. If this scale and speed of development is compared with the educational situation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it would take 250 years to achieve. However, in 1957, after boldly mobilizing the masses to run schools, 1,560 non-governmental middle schools were developed in one year, absorbing nearly 160,000 students, equivalent to half of the total number of students in the original schools, showing the huge potential of mass schooling.

The above two facts allow us to see the prospects for the development of socialist education and find the key to promoting the great leap forward in education: one is to adhere to running schools diligently and thriftily, and the other is to adhere to the mass line.

    从两件事看教育事业的前景
    王迪
    怎样办好社会主义的教育事业？要把青年一代培养成什么样的人？教育事业能不能跃进和怎样跃进？围绕着这一系列的问题，当前在教育战线上正尖锐地进行着两条道路、两个方针的斗争。
    随着整个的社会主义大跃进，在教育事业上也必然要发生革命性的变化，同样来一个大跃进。如何理解这个大跃进的实质呢？从教育的现状来看，最根本的问题应当是：以革命的精神坚决贯彻党的培养劳动者的教育方针，在勤俭建国、勤俭办学的前提下，也要在教育上实现“多、快、好、省”，要少花钱，多办学，办得好。
    但是有这样一些“教育家”，他们总是怀着无穷的忧虑认为：“别的事业能跃进，教育不能跃进”，“要办学，就得钱”，处处向国家伸手。他们以脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的“关门办学”的方针，企图来寻求“提高教育质量”的道路，结果是事与愿违，越走越远。
    1957年在河南教育事业上发生了两件事情，引起了各方面极大的兴趣和注意：一件是出现了长葛三中教育和劳动相结合的先进典型（见人民日报1月20日一版）；一件是在一年之内全省民办中学发展到一千五百六十所。这些生动的事实，体现了社会主义办学的根本原则，并为社会主义教育事业的大跃进开辟了前进的道路。
    河南长葛三中，坚持勤俭办学八年，坚持生产劳动教育已经三年了，它以鲜明的社会主义教育的特点，在以下三个主要方面，表现了和资产阶级教育思想的根本分歧：第一，它坚持教育为工农开门的阶级路线。该校共有学生九百五十人，其中中贫农子弟（不包括富裕中农）就有七百七十三人，占81.3％，这是一所真正为工农开门的学校。教育向来都是为政治服务的。今天在一所普通中学里工农子女占到这样的比例完全是正常的；第二，它坚持勤俭办学的群众路线。少花钱、多办事，是这所学校的优良传统。1952年政府第一次拨给建设三座教室的经费，他们自己动手，完成了任务，又扩建草房十间。第二次他们用原定盖八十一间房子的经费，结果盖了一百零五间房。学校的路是自己修的，操场是自己平的，围墙是自己打的，校园、厕所都由学生自己去整理，男学生自己理发、碾米，女学生自己缝纫、洗衣。1957年暑假有六百零六人回乡参加农业生产，平均每人劳动收入三十元，解决了不少实际困难，原来全校享受助学金的学生有五百四十九人，现在下降到三百二十四人了，学生们用勤工俭学减轻了国家和家庭的经济负担；第三，它坚持教育和劳动相结合、理论和实践相结合的社会主义的教育路线。在这所学校里生产劳动成为学生的必修课，被提到教学计划的日程上来了。现在该校大部分学生都能掌握一定的生产知识和生产技能，据二、三年级六百多人的统计：有五百九十三人学会锄地，有二百四十九人学会耙地，有三百七十八人学会犁地，有七十人学会耩地，有一百九十五人学会扬场，还有不少人学会了喷雾器的使用和液体化学肥料的配制等。现在，学校又对学生的生产劳动教育作了全面规划：新生入学后，除加强思想教育外，第一学期接种毕业班的红薯地，先学收藏红薯；第二学期以学种玉米为主；第三学期以学种小麦为主；第四学期学习玉米和大豆间作；第五学期再学种小麦；第六学期学种红薯。这样，一个学生从入学到毕业的三年期间，就可以切实掌握对几种主要作物的生产知识，学会一些基本的生产技术。用生产的实际本领把学生们武装起来，使他们时刻准备着充当劳动战线上的“新兵”。
    人们担心：这样会打乱学校的“正常秩序”，“降低教育质量”。这里有一个必须明确的问题：用什么标准来衡量学校的正常秩序和教育质量呢？很明显，应当是社会主义的标准，也就是党的教育方针。难道几年来不少学校毕业生轻视劳动、不愿生产、也不会生产的严重情况可以叫做教育上的“正常秩序”吗？事实非常明白，影响学校正常秩序和教育质量的不是别的，正是资产阶级的教育思想在作怪。
    长葛三中由于正确地贯彻了党的教育方针，组织了劳动实践，向“三脱离”（脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际）的有害倾向展开了斗争，获得了教育上的丰收。1957年该校毕业的学生共二百九十五人，其中升学的有七十五人，升学率达到25％，而同一时期，许昌专区各校的平均升学率仅为15％。可以看出，它的学生的学习成绩不但没有降低而是学得更好更扎实了。就去年回乡参加生产的二百二十名毕业生看，他们在劳动中表现很好，许多人都做到了“三满意”：社里满意，群众满意，家庭满意。现在已经有五十三人被评为各种模范和优秀社员，群众称赞长葛三中的学生是“提起笔能写，拿起锄能干”的人。生产劳动教育的贯彻，也促进了学生共产主义道德面貌的全面成长。去年全县有十五个乡受灾，涉及该校学生家庭的有十一个乡，但是学生们思想非常稳定，他们能够听党的话，在困难的时候想办法去战胜困难，表现了团结互助的集体主义精神和不怕困难的革命意志。生产劳动的锻炼，不仅使他们学会了本领，改造了思想，而且也加强了体质。去年在全县举行的体育运动会上，在三十五个项目比赛中，他们获得了二十一项冠军。
    三年来，长葛三中的经验集中地证明了一点：突破教育和生产脱节这一环，可以推动教育的全面改革和提高，促进学校教育事业沿着社会主义的轨道向新的高度跃进。
    社会主义教育事业的大跃进，要在勤俭建国、勤俭办学的原则下，既要提高，又要普及；既要不增加国家的负担，又要不断满足群众的文化要求，便利劳动人民的子女有更多的机会入学。这样，走什么道路呢？现在看来，就是要走勤俭办校、勤工俭学、半工半读这条路，允许办学有正规的和不正规的，要大力贯彻群众路线，放手发动群众，自己解决问题。
    从河南普通中学发展的历史情况看，1949年全省普通中学仅有一百一十一所，1955年发展到三百五十三所，1956年采用了“戴帽”（小学加初中班）的办法，一年之内中学发展到八百四十六所。这种发展的规模和速度，如果与国民党反动统治时期的教育状况相比，它要二百五十年才能达到。但是，1957年在放手发动群众办学之后，一年期间，民办中学又发展了一千五百六十所，吸收学生近十六万人，相当于原有学校学生总数的一半，显示了群众办学的巨大潜力。
    上述两件事实，使我们看到了社会主义教育事业发展的前景，找到了促进教育大跃进的关键：一条是坚持勤俭办学，一条是坚持群众路线。
