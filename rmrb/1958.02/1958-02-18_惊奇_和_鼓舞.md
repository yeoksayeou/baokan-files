　　"Surprise" and "Encouragement"
　　A few days ago, French Foreign Minister Pineau stated that he was "surprised" by the American assertion that it would come forward to "mediate" the dispute between France and Tunisia. Yesterday, an American news agency reported that the French cabinet's decision to agree to American "mediation" "encouraged" the U.S. State Department. Between this surprise and joy, the relationship of mutual deceit and suspicion among colonialists is vividly depicted.

　　It is no secret that the United States wants to take France's place in North Africa by taking advantage of the situation. This is precisely why Pineau "felt surprised" and the U.S. State Department "felt encouraged." As the Western proverb says, "A hypocritical friend is worse than an open enemy." To know this and still take the bait is the tragedy of France, which persists in its colonial policy.

### “惊奇”和“鼓舞”

    “惊奇”和“鼓舞”
    几天以前法国外交部长比诺曾经表示：他对美国要出面“调解”法国和突尼斯之间的纠纷的说法“感到惊奇”。昨天美国通讯社报道：法国内阁决定同意由美国进行“调解”的消息使美国国务院“感到鼓舞”。在这一惊一喜之间，活画出了殖民者彼此之间尔诈我虞的关系。
    美国想趁机在北非取法国而代之，这已不是什么秘密。这正是比诺所以“感到惊奇”，而美国国务院所以“感到鼓舞”的原因。西方谚语说：“伪善的朋友，比公开的朋友还坏”，明知如此，仍要上钩，这正是坚持殖民政策的法国的悲哀。
