　　Yesterday's Math Game Answer
    The math game published yesterday is a rather interesting problem from the so-called "Roman Inheritance Law." According to records, the famous lawyer who solved this problem was named Julianus. When distributing the inheritance, he divided the entire estate into seven equal parts, with the boy receiving four parts, the child's mother receiving two parts, and the little girl receiving one part. What is the basis for this division? It is based on the method of proportions in arithmetic. Because the will stipulated that the boy should receive two-thirds of the property and the wife should receive one-third of the property. Thus, the ratio of the property to be received by the boy and his mother is two to one. Similarly, the ratio of the property to be received by the mother and the girl is also two to one. In this way, if the girl receives one part, her mother should receive two parts; and when the mother receives two parts, the boy should receive four parts. The continued ratio of the property to be received by the three of them should be four to two to one. Therefore, this lawyer divided the entire estate into seven equal parts and distributed them to the mother, son, and daughter in the ratio of four, two, and one, which is in accordance with the deceased's will.

　　昨日数学游戏答案
    昨日登载的数学游戏，是所谓“罗马遗产律”中颇饶兴味的一个问题。据记载，解决这个问题的著名律师名叫朱理安纳斯。他在分配遗产时，把全部遗产均分为七份，男孩得四份，孩子的母亲得两份，小女孩得一份。这种分法的根据是什么呢？它所根据的是算术中的比例的方法。因遗嘱中规定，男孩得产业的三分之二，妻子得产业的三分之一。这样，男孩同他母亲应得产业的比是二比一。同样母亲与女孩应得产业的比也是二比一。这样，如果女孩得一份，她母亲就该二份；而当母亲得二份时，男孩就该得四份。他们三人应得产业的连比应为四比二比一。所以，这个律师把全部遗产均分为七份，按四、二、一的比例分配给母子三人，是合乎死者的遗嘱的。　（张怀古）
