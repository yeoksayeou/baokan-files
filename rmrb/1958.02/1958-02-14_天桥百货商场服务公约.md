Tianqiao Department Store Service Code

(1) When a customer approaches the counter, the salesperson should actively greet them, saying something like: "Comrade! What do you need?" or "Comrade, what are you looking at?" For example, in the shoe section, they should say: "Comrade, what kind of shoes are you looking for?" Elderly people can be addressed as "Old Uncle," "Old Sir," "Old Aunt," or "Old Lady." The attitude should be kind and polite, the tone should be friendly and gentle, and they should not be treated coldly or ignored, nor should the salesperson wait for the customer to ask.

(2) If some customers are just visiting, they should also be welcomed. Attention should be paid with eyes, mouth, and hands. When a customer stands in front of the counter and pays particular attention to a certain commodity, the salesperson should try to take it out for them to look at and explain, "You can take a look first, and you can buy it later when you need it," to ease the customer's concerns.

(3) When a customer indicates that they want to buy a certain commodity, the salesperson should immediately take out the commodity and introduce it to them, according to the different types of customers.

(4) When a customer is selecting a commodity, the salesperson should actively and sincerely help them choose, truthfully introduce the quality of the commodity, not exaggerate the advantages or conceal the disadvantages, and use comparative methods to explain the advantages and disadvantages. Especially for defective products, the salesperson should explain how much worse they are than the good ones, and where the defect is, and should not cover it up. The salesperson should also not show impatience because the customer picks a lot of items. They should say: "Take your time to choose, if you are not satisfied, I will get you more." When the customer has picked a lot but still says they don't want it, the salesperson should say: "If you can't find something you like this time, you can buy it next time when there's something suitable." When a customer is hesitant, the salesperson should, according to the different types of customers, combine their sales experience to introduce or recommend a suitable commodity to the customer.

(5) When a customer has chosen a commodity, the salesperson should ask if the customer needs anything else and introduce related commodities, explaining the uses of the commodities and the relationship between them. After the customer has selected the commodity, the salesperson should count it clearly in front of them, pack it properly, and explain the precautions for carrying, storing, and using it. Finally, the salesperson should clearly explain the amount due, the amount received, and the amount to be returned to the customer. After handing over the goods, the salesperson should say goodbye politely.

(6) When business is busy and customers are crowded and waiting to buy goods, the salesperson should actively and kindly say, "Please wait a moment," and should not ignore them. The salesperson should try to take out the goods for the customers to see (but be careful not to cause confusion or loss). If the commodity the customer is asking about is not sold in this section or is already sold out, the salesperson should first explain it to the customer to avoid the customer waiting in vain.

(7) When a customer wants to buy a commodity that is in short supply or temporarily unavailable, the salesperson should patiently explain the reason for the shortage and introduce a commodity of the same quality or similar, and should not simply say "no." When a customer asks when a certain commodity will be in stock, the salesperson should truthfully answer based on the actual situation of the commodity, and should not coldly say "I don't know"; if the salesperson is really not sure, they should also say: "The arrival time is uncertain, you can come and check often." The salesperson should also fill in the shortage registration book, leaving the customer's address and telephone number so that the customer can be notified when the goods arrive.

(8) If the commodity the customer wants to buy is not in this section, the salesperson should also kindly explain to the customer where it is sold and point out the location.

(9) When a customer asks to return or exchange a commodity, the salesperson should not be bothered, but should patiently listen to the customer's reasons. If the commodity should not be returned or exchanged (such as food), the salesperson should explain the reason why it cannot be returned or exchanged, and should not refuse bluntly. If the customer insists on returning or exchanging the commodity, the salesperson should ask them to go to the office to resolve the issue.
