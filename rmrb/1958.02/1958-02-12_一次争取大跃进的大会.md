An editorial: A Conference to Strive for a Great Leap Forward

    The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress concluded victoriously yesterday. This session reviewed and approved the 1958 national budget, decided on the national economic plan for 1958, approved the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, and also passed some other important resolutions related to national life. At this session, many delegates vividly introduced the plans, situations, and experiences of the great leap forward on various fronts of socialist construction. This is the prelude to a new leap forward in the national economy in 1958, and this new leap forward is undoubtedly a good start to implementing the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy.

    To meet the requirements of the new leap forward in the national economy, the main tasks for developing the national economy in 1958 are to vigorously promote the high tide of agricultural production from all aspects and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture; actively develop heavy industry, mainly increasing the production of fuel, electricity, raw materials, chemical fertilizers, heavy machinery, agricultural power machinery, and electrical equipment to ensure the needs of expanded reproduction; increase investment in capital construction as much as possible according to the possibility of material and financial resources, mainly investment in productive construction, to further increase production capacity; strive to increase the production of consumer goods, continue to consolidate the stability of market prices, and appropriately improve people's lives; and develop cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings step by step according to the possible conditions of economic development.

    In order to strive for a new leap forward in the national economy, the various economic indicators for 1958 have been set relatively positively. The planned total value of industrial output is to increase by 14.6% compared to 1957, with an increase of 18.8% in the production of means of production and an increase of 9.7% in the production of consumer goods; while in 1957, the growth rate of the total value of industrial output was 6.9%, the growth rate of means of production was 12.0%, and the growth rate of consumer goods was 3.0%. The planned total value of agricultural output is to increase by 6.1% compared to 1957, with an increase of 5.9% in grain production, while in 1957, the growth rate of the total value of agricultural output was 3.5%, and the growth rate of grain production was 1.7%. Based on the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the state's investment in capital construction is planned to increase by 17.8% compared to 1957, while in 1957, the investment in capital construction did not increase compared to 1956.

    Do we have the conditions to strive for a new leap forward in our national economy and complete and overfulfill the national economic plan for 1958? We have these conditions completely.

    The victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle has created extremely favorable political conditions for us. The victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle not only shattered the bourgeois Rightists' frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, further consolidated the unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class, and consolidated the socialist political and economic systems; but also further enhanced the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country and encouraged the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people. After the rectification campaign, many things that many people thought were impossible to do in the past have now been done quickly; many problems that could not be solved for a long time in the past have now been solved quickly; many good methods that were originally unthinkable have now been devised by the masses; and many potential forces that were not discovered in the past are now being continuously tapped. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of our country are pushing our socialist construction to a new upsurge with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. This invincible force is the basic driving force for the new leap forward development of our national economy.

    It should be particularly pointed out that the vigorous mass movement of building farmland water conservancy projects, in which nearly 100 million men and women laborers have participated since last winter, under the inspiration of the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program and the promotion of the nationwide rectification and the great debate on the two roads, is the beginning of the new leap forward in our national economy. Echoing the high tide on the agricultural front, new high tides are also emerging on the industrial front and other fronts. This trend shows that the prospect of a new leap forward in our national economy is becoming increasingly prominent before us.

    The completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan and the laying of the initial foundation for socialist industrialization have created better material and technical conditions for us than ever before. Through the efforts of the people of the whole country and the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union during the First Five-Year Plan, our country has built a series of new industrial sectors, industrial production capacity has greatly increased, the technical level has been improved to a certain extent, the original industrial base has been greatly strengthened, and new industrial bases are being built. Now, except for some very large heavy machinery and particularly precise machines, we have been able to manufacture many kinds of equipment to build most of the heavy industrial enterprises and the vast majority of light industrial enterprises needed by our country; we have been able to gradually equip the agricultural sector, the transportation sector, and strengthen national defense with many machines manufactured by ourselves; and we have been able to supply most of the needs of our country's construction with metals and other raw materials produced by ourselves. In terms of design work, we have also been able to independently design many large-scale and technically complex projects. All this has prepared favorable technical conditions for the new upsurge of our national economy.

    In short, whether from a political or material point of view, the situation of a new leap forward in our national economy has gradually taken shape. However, a favorable situation itself cannot naturally bring about a new leap forward in the production and construction of each region, each sector of the national economy, and each enterprise unit. A favorable situation only gives us the possibility of a leap forward. To turn this possibility into reality, the people of the whole country need to strive in every possible way to achieve this new leap forward in the national economy. It requires the combination of leadership and the masses, and it requires the leaders of all localities, departments, and enterprise units to stand at the forefront of the movement, resolutely rely on the masses, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Otherwise, the new leap forward in our national economy is impossible.

    The vast majority of regions, departments, and enterprise units across the country are doing this, or are preparing to do this. However, there are also a very small number of regions, departments, and enterprise units that have not yet done this, or have not yet prepared to do this. In those places, some comrades still do not believe that their work can really leap forward. They do not understand that under socialist conditions, in order to rapidly and fundamentally improve our country's original situation of being "poor and blank" and to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people of our country, the leap-forward development of economic construction is not only completely necessary but also completely possible. The Soviet Union completed nearly half a century of the road of capitalist countries in less than fifteen years, and Soviet industry increased thirty times in forty years. This is our example. In the short eight years after liberation, China's industry increased by 6.7 times, and agriculture increased by more than 50%. This is already a fairly rapid development. But this speed is still far from meeting the needs of the people of our country. We must catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years; we must realize the National Agricultural Development Program Forty Articles ahead of schedule in the next few years. This means that we must never be satisfied with the existing speed. The people of our country must muster their energy and leap forward at a higher speed.

    In order to achieve this leap forward, we should pay special attention to the first three years. Our slogan is to work hard for three years and strive to fundamentally change the face of most parts of the country in three years. The first year is crucial for the three years, and we must make every possible effort to win a great victory in our national economy this year.

    Only forty days have passed in 1958, but the working people of the whole country have already created many exciting and encouraging "miracles". At this session of the National People's Congress, the speeches of many delegates reported these "miracles" to us. Although these reports are only a small part, they are completely sufficient to show that the future of our nation is truly promising. One noteworthy aspect of the current upsurge in socialist construction is that many of those who are at the forefront of the movement are regions, departments, and units with more and greater difficulties. For example, Anhui Province and Hebei Province are greatly threatened by floods, which is a serious difficulty in the local agricultural development. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of these two provinces have turned difficult conditions into favorable conditions. The former completed more than 1.6 billion cubic meters of farmland water conservancy projects in the past winter and this spring, expanding the irrigated area by nearly 7 million mu, and improving the irrigated area and the area of waterlogged land by more than 10 million mu each. Recently, it has put forward the heroic slogan of building another 800 million cubic meters of earthwork. In the farmland water conservancy construction movement in Hebei Province in the past winter and this spring, the newly increased irrigated area alone was more than 21 million mu. There are also many moving examples on the industrial front. The "Quickly Catch Up with the Advanced" of the Beijing Heating Material Factory is a typical example. Compared with the Tianjin Steel Plant, the former uses the latest electric furnace imported from abroad to make steel, while the latter uses old electric furnaces riveted and welded by workers with old steel; however, the cost of cast steel parts produced by the former is more than 30% higher than that of the latter. In the past, some staff members of the Beijing Heating Material Factory believed that the situation of their factory's backward indicators was unchangeable; however, after the promotion of the rectification campaign and the production upsurge, the criticism of right-leaning conservative ideology, and the learning of the advanced experience of the Tianjin Steel Plant, the production cost per ton of cast steel parts was reduced from 740 yuan to 560 yuan, and the output was greatly increased and the quality was improved. In this way, under the condition that the selling price of cast steel parts is reduced by one-third, the factory's profit plan for this year will still increase by 70% compared to the previous year. These facts make people particularly confident: since regions, departments, and units with relatively difficult conditions can still advance so greatly, what obstacles cannot be overcome in the great leap forward nationwide? The representatives attending this National People's Congress are returning to their respective work posts one after another. We hope that all the representatives can bring the revolutionary enthusiasm filled in this conference to all corners of the country, and the work of all regions, departments, and units will be greatly promoted one step forward without exception.

### 一次争取大跃进的大会

    一次争取大跃进的大会
    第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议昨天胜利闭幕了。这次会议审查和批准了1958年的国家预算，决定了1958年度的国民经济计划，批准了汉语拼音方案，此外还通过了一些其他的有关国家生活的重要决议。在这次会议上，许多代表极其生动地介绍了社会主义建设的各个战线上大跃进的计划、情况和经验。这是1958年国民经济新跃进的序幕，这个新的跃进无疑地是执行我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的一个良好的开端。
    适应国民经济新跃进的要求，1958年发展国民经济的主要任务，是以很大的力量从各方面来促进农业生产的高潮，争取农业大丰收；积极地发展重工业，主要是增产燃料、电力、原材料、化学肥料、重型机械、农业动力机械和电力设备，保证扩大再生产的需要；按照物力、财力的可能，尽量增加基本建设的投资，主要是生产性建设的投资，进一步提高生产能力；努力增加生活资料的生产，继续巩固市场物价的稳定，适当地改善人民生活；根据经济发展的可能条件，有步骤地发展文化、教育、卫生等项事业。
    为了争取国民经济的新跃进，1958年各项经济指标订得是比较积极的。工业生产总值计划比1957年增长14.6％，生产资料生产增长18.8％，消费资料生产增长9.7％；而在1957年，工业生产总值的增长速度是6.9％，生产资料的增长速度是12.0％，消费资料的增长速度是3.0％。农业生产总值计划比1957年增长6.1％，粮食生产增长5.9％，而在1957年，农业总产值的增长速度是3.5％，粮食生产的增长速度是1.7％。在工农业生产增长的基础上，国家用于基本建设的投资，计划比1957年增长17.8％，而1957年的基本建设投资同1956年相比，则没有什么增长。
    我们有没有条件争取我国国民经济来一个新的跃进，完成并且超额完成1958年度的国民经济计划呢？完全有这种条件。
    全民整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利，给我们创造了极其有利的政治条件。整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利，不仅粉碎了资产阶级右派对党对社会主义的猖狂进攻，进一步巩固了全国人民在工人阶级领导下的团结，巩固了社会主义的政治制度和经济制度；而且进一步提高了全国人民的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞了广大干部和广大群众的社会主义干劲。经过整风运动，许多人过去认为根本办不到的事情，现在很快地就办好了；许多过去长期不能解决的问题，现在很快地解决了；许多原来想不到的好办法，现在群众都想出来了；许多过去没有被发现的潜在力量，现在不断地被发掘出来了。在党的领导下，我国人民正在以愚公移山的精神，把我国的社会主义建设推向一个新的高潮。这种无坚不摧的力量，是我国国民经济新的跃进发展的基本动力。
    特别应当指出：我国农民在发展农业的四十条纲要的鼓舞之下，在全民整风和两条道路大辩论的推动之下，从去年冬季开始的、有将近一万万个男女劳动力参加的热火朝天的兴修农田水利的运动，就是我国国民经济新跃进的开始。同农业战线的高潮相辉映，在工业战线上以及其它战线上也正在出现新的高潮。这种趋势说明，我国国民经济的新跃进的前景，已经愈来愈加显著地出现在我们面前。
    第一个五年计划的完成和超额完成，社会主义工业化初步基础的奠定，给我们创造了比以往更好的物质技术条件。经过第一个五年计划期间全国人民的努力和苏联兄弟般的援助，我国已经建设起一系列的新的工业部门，工业生产能力有了很大的增长，技术水平有了一定的提高，原有的工业基地大为加强，新的工业基地正在建设起来。现在，除了一些特大的重型机器和特别精密的机器以外，我们已经能够制造许多种设备，来建设我国所需要的大多数重工业企业和绝大多数轻工业企业了；我们已经能够用自己制造的许多机器来逐步地装备本国的农业部门、运输部门，并且加强国防了；我们已经能够用自己生产的金属和其它原材料来供应我国建设事业的大部分需要了。在设计工作方面，许多大型的、技术比较复杂的工程，我们也能够自行设计了。这一切，对于我国国民经济的新的高涨，准备了有利的技术条件。
    总之，无论从政治的或者物质的条件来看，我国国民经济新的跃进的形势，已经逐渐形成。但是，有利形势本身，并不能够自然而然地给每个地区、每个国民经济部门、每个企业单位的生产和建设带来新的跃进。有利的形势，只是给我们以跃进的可能性，要把这种可能性变为现实，就需要全国人民千方百计地为实现这个国民经济的新跃进而奋斗。就需要领导同群众相结合，就需要各地方、各部门、各企业单位的领导者站在运动的前面，坚决依靠群众，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性。否则，我国国民经济的新跃进是不可能的。
    全国绝大多数的地区、部门和企业单位都在这样做，或者准备这样做。但是，也有极少数的地区、部门和企业单位，还没有这样做，或者还没有准备这样做。在那些地方，还有些同志不相信他们的工作真的能够跃进。他们不了解，在社会主义条件下，为了迅速地根本改善我们国家原有的“又穷又白”的状况，提高我国人民的物质和文化生活水平，经济建设的跃进式的发展不但是完全必要的，而且是完全可能的。苏联以不到十五年的时间，走完了资本主义国家将近半个世纪的路程，苏联的工业在四十年间增长三十倍，这就是我们的榜样。我国在解放后短短的八年间，工业增长了六点七倍，农业增长了50％以上。这已经是一种相当迅速的发展。但是这个速度对于我国人民的需要来说还是远远不够的。我们要在十五年左右在钢铁和其他重要工业产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国；我们要在今后几年内提前实现全国农业发展纲要四十条。这就是说，我们决不能满足于已有的速度。我们全国人民必须鼓起干劲，用更高的速度向前跃进。
    为了实现这个跃进，我们应当特别抓紧前三年。我们的口号是苦战三年，争取在三年内使全国大部分地区的面貌基本改观。三年看头年，我们必须千方百计地努力争取我国国民经济在今年内打一个大胜仗。
    现在1958年才过去四十天，但是全国的劳动人民已经创造出了很多令人兴奋鼓舞的“奇迹”。在这次全国人民代表大会的会议上，很多代表的发言就向我们报道了这些“奇迹”，这些报道虽然只是很小一部分，但是已经完全足以表明，我们民族的前途真正是大有希望。目前的社会主义建设高潮中有一个值得注意的地方，就是走在运动前面的，不少的是困难较多、较大的地区、部门和单位。例如，安徽省和河北省所受的水灾威胁是很大的，这是当地农业发展中的一个严重的困难。但是，这两个省的人民在党的领导之下，变困难条件为有利条件。前者在去冬今春完成兴修十六亿多土方的农田水利工程，扩大灌溉面积将近七百万亩，改善灌溉面积和治理洼地面积各一千多万亩，最近又提出了再修八亿土方的英雄口号。河北省在去冬今春兴修农田水利建设运动中，仅仅新增加的灌溉面积，即有二千一百多万亩。在工业战线上也有很多动人的例子。北京市暖气材料厂“快马追先进”就是一个典型。这个工厂同天津钢厂比较，前者是用从国外进口的最新式的电炉炼钢，后者则用工人拿旧的钢材铆焊起来的陈旧的电炉炼钢；但是，前者生产的铸钢件的成本却比后者高30％以上。过去，北京暖气材料厂的一部分工作人员，认为他们工厂指标落后的情况是无法改变的；可是，经过整风运动和生产高潮的推动，批判了右倾保守思想，学习了天津钢厂的先进经验之后，每吨铸钢件的生产成本就由七百四十元降低到五百六十元，并且大大地增加了产量，提高了质量。这样，在铸钢件售价降低三分之一的条件下，今年全厂的利润计划还将比上一年增长70％。这些事实使人们特别充满信心：既然条件比较困难的地区、部门和单位尚且能够如此大步地向前猛进，那么，全国范围的大跃进还有什么不能克服的障碍呢？出席这次人民代表大会的代表正在陆续回到各自的工作岗位，我们希望所有的代表同志们能把充满在这次大会上的革命干劲带到全国各个角落去，各个地区、各个部门和各个单位的工作都无例外地大大向前推动一步。
