Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 5th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to immediately launch a movement to reform agricultural technology in order to meet the urgent requirements of the rapid development of agricultural production.

The Provincial Committee held a special meeting on the 3rd to study this issue. The meeting pointed out that backward agricultural technology is far from meeting the requirements of agricultural production after the great leap forward in water conservancy and manure accumulation. This year in Guangdong Province, the area benefiting from water conservancy will reach more than 24.4 million mu (12 million mu have been completed), and manure accumulation per mu per crop will reach more than 100 dan (half has been completed). With so much good water conservancy and fertilizer, many agricultural technology reforms that were previously difficult to achieve, such as the large-scale promotion of single-cropping to double-cropping, intensive cultivation, and advanced cultivation methods, can be done with confidence. If technological reform keeps up, the role of water conservancy and fertilizer will be fully utilized; conversely, it will weaken the effectiveness of water conservancy and fertilizer. However, this point has not received enough attention from leaders in various regions.

The current problem is to change the situation where the leadership's thinking cannot keep up with the situation. Due to the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects and manure accumulation, it is expected that 60 counties in the province can eliminate drought before the spring plowing and 18 counties can eliminate drought before the summer harvest, and the area benefiting from water conservancy will expand by more than 24.4 million mu. Fertilizer is also sufficient. The vast majority of farmland cultivated using backward methods has the conditions for reform. It is reckless to reform without conditions; it is conservative not to use or actively reform when conditions are available.

The meeting requested that local Party committees and relevant departments, on the basis of doing a good job in water conservancy and manure accumulation, immediately organize a technical reform movement. This year, 20 million mu of cultivated land that is cultivated relatively extensively must implement intensive cultivation and change all backward farming systems that can be changed. The Provincial Party Committee called on various regions to learn from the example of Longchuan County (this county will change all 80,000 mu of single-cropping fields and two-season intercropping fields to double-cropping continuous cropping this year), requiring that the vast majority of 5 million mu of single-cropping fields be changed to double-cropping fields. More than 1 million mu of two-season intercropping will be changed to two-season continuous cropping. This year, all regions must vigorously promote a complete set of advanced cultivation methods centered on small-plant dense planting (from seed soaking to sowing, from strong seedlings to irrigation and fertilization, etc.).

The meeting believed that to implement technical reform, the first thing is to solve ideological problems. The labor model conferences held by special districts and counties should focus on agricultural technology reform as the main content. Before sowing, each county must also hold a conference of township and commune cadres specifically to study technical reform. At the labor model conferences and township and commune cadre conferences, there should be great airing of views, great debates, and the use of accounting, comparison, and visiting methods to ensure that everyone is ideologically aligned, enthusiastic, confident, and resourceful when carrying out technical reforms. After the cadres' thinking is clear, a great airing of views and a great debate on technical reform issues should also be organized among the broad masses of farmers.

In order to solve the problem of technical training, the meeting put forward the following methods: (1) Organize large-scale mass technical visits. County Party Committee leaders in areas with extensive cultivation should visit Shantou area to see intensive cultivation. Each county and each region should discover local examples of better technical reform and mobilize the surrounding people to visit them. (2) Each county should run technical training courses to train a large number of technicians. (3) All technical cadres should be sent down. The cadres of the 5,000 technical stations set up in various counties must go to agricultural cooperatives and production teams without exception. Agricultural technicians in county-level and above agencies and schools should also frequently go deep into agricultural cooperatives. (4) All rural work cadres above the township level should establish high-yield demonstration fields to set an example of technical reform and acquire technical knowledge. Each commune should also train a high-yield team to do a good job in technical reform and create experience in large-scale production increases.

The meeting also studied how to supply improved varieties, protect livestock, improve agricultural implements, and improve the technical management system of agricultural cooperatives in technical reforms.

### 适应水利积肥大发展的新形势  广东开展农业技术改革运动

　　适应水利积肥大发展的新形势
    广东开展农业技术改革运动
    本报特约新华社广州5日电中共广东省委决定立刻开展一个改革农业技术的运动，以适应农业生产急速发展的迫切要求。
    省委在3日专门开会研究了这个问题。会议指出，落后的农业技术已经远远不能适应水利、积肥大跃进后农业生产的要求。广东省今年水利受益面积将达二千四百多万亩（已完成一千二百万亩），每亩每造积肥将达一百担以上（已完成一半）。有了这么多这么好的水利和肥料，许多以往很难做到的农业技术改革，如大规模地推行单造改双造、精耕细作、先进的栽培方法等，都可以有把握做到了。技术改革跟上去，就会充分发挥水利、肥料的作用；反过来，也会削弱水利、肥料的效力。可是，这一点尚未引起各地领导干部的足够重视。
    现在的问题是要改变领导思想跟不上形势的情况。于由大规模地兴修水利和积肥，预计全省有六十个县在春耕前可以消灭旱灾，十八个县在夏收前消灭旱灾，水利受益面积扩大二千四百多万亩。肥料又充足。那些用落后方法耕作的农田，绝大部分具备了改革的条件。没有条件，硬去改革，是冒进；有了条件，不利用，不积极改革，是保守。
    会议要求各地党委，各有关部门，在办好水利、积肥的基础上，立刻动手组织一个技术改革运动。二千万亩耕作比较粗放的耕地，今年必须实行精耕细作，改变一切能够改变的落后的耕作制度。省委号召各地学习龙川县的榜样（这个县今年要把全部单造田和两季间作田八万亩改为双造连作），要求五百万亩单造田绝大部分改为双造田。一百多万亩两季间作改两季连作。各地今年必须大力推行以小株密植为中心的整套的先进的栽培方法（从浸种到播种，从壮秧到排灌和施肥等等）。
    会议认为，要实行技术改革，首先要解决思想问题。专区、县召开的劳模大会，要把农业技术改革作为主要内容。播种以前，各县还要召开一次专门研究技术改革的乡、社干部会议。在劳模会和乡、社干部会上，都要就当地技术改革问题，大鸣大放大争，再用算账、对比、参观的方法，做到在搞技术改革时，大家思想通，干劲大，信心强，办法多。干部思想通了以后，还要在广大农民群众中，组织一次技术改革问题的大鸣大放大辩论。
    为了解决技术训练问题，会议提出来的办法有：（1）组织大规模的群众性的技术参观。耕作粗放的地区的县委负责同志，到汕头地区参观精耕细作。每个县，每个地区都要发现本地的技术改革较好的典型，发动周围的人去参观。（2）各县都要开办技术训练班，训练大批技术员。（3）全部技术干部下放。分设在各县的五千个技术站的干部，要毫无例外地到农业社去，到生产队去。县以上机关和学校中的农业技术人员也要经常深入农业社。（4）乡以上的所有农村工作干部都要建立丰产示范田，作出技术改革的榜样，获得技术知识。每个社还要培养一个丰产队，作好技术改革，创造大面积增产的经验。
    会议还研究了技术改革中如何供应良种、保护牲畜、改良农具、改善农业社有关技术管理制度等问题。
