(Special dispatch from our newspaper and Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, February 25) Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, criticized local nationalist words and deeds in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in his report at the Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently.

Ulanhu said that the struggle between the two paths of socialism and capitalism is prominently manifested in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the struggle between the Marxist-Leninist view of nationality and bourgeois nationalist ideology. The Party has always opposed any great-Han chauvinist tendencies and local nationalist tendencies that hinder national unity, and has paid special attention to preventing and correcting great-Han chauvinist tendencies among Han Party members and state workers. We have conducted several inspections of the implementation of ethnic policies, and we have constantly and repeatedly educated Party members and state workers to pay attention to ethnic characteristics and regional characteristics in all their work, and to oppose the style of mechanically copying. The thrust of these struggles has been directed against great-Han chauvinist ideological tendencies. In the rectification campaign and in the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, we must continue to criticize great-Han chauvinist ideological tendencies. As long as the influence of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois ideology exists for one day, this ideological tendency will exist for one day. Therefore, preventing and correcting great-Han chauvinist ideological tendencies remains our long-term political task in the future.

Local nationalism has become the main danger at present and must be resolutely opposed and criticized.

Ulanhu said that in the past year or two, with the continuous victory of the socialist revolution, the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes have been unwilling to accept defeat and have attempted to struggle and resist. This situation cannot but be reflected in the thinking of some Mongolian and other minority intellectuals, state workers, and even some Party members. As a result, local nationalism has grown anew. When the bourgeois rightists launched a wild attack on the Party last year, local nationalists of Mongolian and other minority nationalities also launched a wild attack on the Party on ethnic issues. They opposed the leadership of the Party and opposed socialism from the perspective of ethnic relations and the Party's ethnic policies, attempting to separate the Mongolian and other minority nationalities from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and from the socialist path. Obviously, local nationalism has become the main danger at present and must be resolutely opposed and criticized. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as a whole, the vast majority of Mongolian and other minority cadres are good, and the number of local nationalists is very small, and they do not occupy important positions in the Party and state organs. However, as far as local nationalist ideological tendencies are concerned, they exist to varying degrees among Mongolian and other minority intellectuals and state workers. This is because some people still maintain a bourgeois world outlook, and most people lack a class viewpoint and a method of class analysis in their views on ethnic issues and in handling ethnic relations. Therefore, they may become prisoners of nationalists in their views on one issue or another. In this way, people with nationalist ideological tendencies, if their nationalist ideological tendencies are not criticized and effectively corrected, and are allowed to develop, may also become bourgeois nationalists. It should be pointed out that people with local nationalist ideological tendencies are different in nature from local nationalists. Local nationalist ideological tendencies are ideological issues and are one aspect of contradictions among the people. Local nationalists are essentially bourgeois rightists. The anti-Party, anti-socialist, and destructive words and actions of local nationalists that undermine the unification of the motherland and national unity must be resolutely and strictly criticized. However, with the exception of the most vicious elements, we will generally handle them as contradictions among the people. People with local nationalist tendencies should be appropriately criticized, and the formula of unity-criticism-unity should be adopted to make them change their bourgeois view of nationality.

Ulanhu criticized the several basic viewpoints of local nationalism one by one:

Opposition to national unity is undermining the unification of the motherland, thereby also undermining the interests of the nation.

Local nationalists advocate national division and oppose national unity. They advocate using the current semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas as the boundary to divide the autonomous region into Mongolian and Han areas, move all the Mongolians in the mixed Mongolian-Han areas to pastoral areas, and move the Mongolians from outside the region to the autonomous region. They say that China is not the homeland of the Mongolians, and advocate separating Inner Mongolia from the big family of the motherland. They advocate that Chinese should not be one of the common languages ​​of the autonomous region. They fabricate the so-called "consistent struggle theory" of Mongolian and Han nationalities, and fail to see the peaceful assistance of Mongolian and Han working people, the common destiny and common struggle of Mongolian and Han nationalities, and the formation of new ethnic relations after the founding of the People's Republic of China.

We know that due to the long-term coexistence, economic mutual assistance, and cultural exchange between the Mongolian and Han working people in Inner Mongolia, a close and inseparable relationship has been formed. Hundreds of years ago, Han people came here to live, engaged in handicrafts, commerce, and agriculture, bringing culture and technology, and promoting economic development. Of course, in the era of the reactionary rule of great-Han chauvinism, policies of rule, plunder, division, and assimilation were implemented against the Mongolian nationality, causing deep disasters to the Mongolian people; but even during that period, the Mongolian and Han working people still had a side of economic mutual assistance, cultural exchange, and political unity. Due to long-term historical development, today, in Inner Mongolia, there are vast pastoral areas where more than 300,000 Mongolian people live, agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas where more than 800,000 Mongolians, more than 6 million Han people, and Daur, Korean, and other minority farmers live together, as well as nearly 100 towns where various ethnic groups live together. They are connected by more than 3,300 kilometers of railways and more than 13,000 kilometers of highways, forming an inseparable whole of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. This is the economic whole of Inner Mongolia and the ethnic relationship as a whole.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the motherland in history, territory, economy, politics, and culture. It is connected to the motherland through the Beijing-Baotou Railway, Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, Binzhou Railway, and North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China. Every year, it supplies the whole country with large quantities of grain, livestock, fur, dairy products, salt, alkali, and other mineral products; and all parts of the country supply the autonomous region with cloth, department stores, and other industrial products.

From the political aspect, during the nearly 110 years of imperialist invasion of China, the Mongolian and Han people were jointly subjected to the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They had common anti-imperialist and anti-feudal demands. This common destiny and common political demands united them politically and jointly carried out the national democratic revolution. Especially after the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the Mongolian and Han people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carried out long-term struggles shoulder to shoulder. In the domestic war and in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the blood of many outstanding sons and daughters of the Mongolian and Han people was coagulated together. The Mongolian and Han people shared life and death for a long time, and finally won the victory of the revolution under the leadership of the Party.

The founding of the People's Republic of China, the overthrow of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the establishment of the People's Democratic Dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance have fundamentally changed domestic ethnic relations. Ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance have replaced ethnic oppression. In areas that have undergone democratic reforms and socialist transformations, the exploiting classes within each nationality have been eliminated or are being eliminated, and the class roots of ethnic oppression have also been eliminated and are being eliminated. Today, the relationship between ethnic groups is one of brotherly equality, fraternity, and mutual assistance under the leadership of the Communist Party.

From long-term experience, the Mongolian people have deeply realized that only when the Mongolian and Han people unite can they win the victory of the revolution and achieve national liberation; only unity can build socialism and achieve national prosperity and development.

National unity is the highest principle of ethnic relations. "The unification of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause." Undermining national unity is undermining the unification of the motherland, undermining socialist construction, and undermining national interests. It is conceivable what a tragic situation the Mongolian nationality in Inner Mongolia would fall into if the reactionary attempts of the local nationalists were to succeed.

The Communist Party is the united advanced force of the working class, and the Party cannot be divided according to ethnic composition.

Local nationalists also viciously distort the nature of the Party and attack the leadership of the Party. They do not regard the Party as the highest form of class organization of the working class, not as the unity of Marxism-Leninism, but divide the Party according to ethnic components. They believe that only people of their own nationality can understand ethnic feelings and represent ethnic interests. Han Party members are great-Han chauvinists, and ethnic Party members who are highly conscious and loyal to the Party and the cause of socialism are all ethnic "traitors." They slander the Inner Mongolia Party Committee as great-Han chauvinism. They viciously say: "Great-Han chauvinism in Inner Mongolia is like influenza, spreading everywhere." This is a slander against the nature of the Party and the Party's ethnic policies.

"The Communist Party of China is the advanced force of the Chinese working class and the highest form of class organization of the working class." Its members, regardless of their ethnic composition, must have the position and viewpoint of the proletariat, must take Marxism-Leninism as a guide to action, and must work under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party organizations at all levels. The Communist Party is the united advanced force of the working class guided by Marxism-Leninism, not an alliance of all ethnic groups and classes. The Party cannot be divided according to ethnic composition.

To liberate itself, the working class must liberate all mankind. The Chinese Communist Party not only represents the interests of the working class, but also represents the interests of all working people and the people of all nationalities in the country. It has no interests that differ from those of the working class, all working people, and the people of all nationalities. Moreover, only the Chinese Communist Party can represent the interests of the people of all nationalities.

We Communists believe that a nation is a product of a certain historical period. Like everything else, it has its own occurrence, development, and decline. However, the gradual decline of nations and the gradual disappearance of national boundaries are matters of a highly developed communist society in all aspects. It is a natural development process, not an artificial process. We should emphasize that as long as national boundaries exist for one day, we must attach importance to national characteristics and correctly apply the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in accordance with national characteristics. "A proletarian party, if it ignores national characteristics, will inevitably become detached from life and the masses, and will inevitably cause losses to the socialist cause." Our Party's policy is to fully develop the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all nationalities, eliminate the economic and cultural backwardness left over by history, and make all nationalities join the ranks of socialist nationalities. The general program of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China states: "The Communist Party of China must make special efforts to improve the status of all minority nationalities, help the autonomy of all minority nationalities, strive to train minority cadres, promote the economic and cultural development of all minority nationalities, realize the complete equality of all nationalities, and consolidate the unity and fraternal relations of all nationalities. Social reforms of all nationalities should be completed by all nationalities according to their own wishes and taking steps that are suitable for their own national characteristics. The Party opposes any great-Han chauvinist tendencies and local nationalist tendencies that hinder national unity, and special attention should be paid to preventing and correcting great-Han chauvinist tendencies among Han Party members and state workers." This is the basic program of the Chinese Communist Party for domestic minority nationalities.

The great achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the people of Inner Mongolia will make everyone realize that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the centuries-old division of the Mongolian nationality in Inner Mongolia be ended and a unified autonomous region be established; only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can national liberation be achieved, and the victories of democratic reforms and socialist transformation can be achieved, and the exploiting classes can be eliminated; only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can there be today's great development of economy and culture, and today's and tomorrow's happy and happier life. A large number of facts show that only the Chinese Communist Party is the representative of the interests of all nationalities in China.

The Chinese Communist Party has always vigorously trained ethnic cadres. However, the Party believes that only by training ethnic cadres to be loyal to the working class, the working people, and the cause of socialism can they truly become representatives of national interests and national sentiments. Anyone who maintains the position and viewpoint of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes cannot represent national interests and national sentiments.

Local nationalists, on the pretext of "opposing assimilation," are essentially opposing socialism.

Local nationalists even more viciously and comprehensively attack the Party's various policies and oppose socialist transformation and socialist construction. They attempt to drag the people of Inner Mongolia out of the socialist orbit and restore the road of national division, national backwardness, and decline.

The most basic slogan of local nationalists is "opposing assimilation," and the most basic argument is "the ratio of Mongolian and Han population is one to seven."

The one-to-seven ratio of the Mongolian and Han population in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the result of long-term historical development. Today, the relationship between them is the relationship between the working people headed by the working class. It is precisely because more than 7 million Han people and more than 1 million Mongolian and other minority nationalities coexist peacefully and unite to build on 1.4 million square kilometers of land that Inner Mongolia has formed such a situation of mutual support and mutual development of various economies today. Everyone knows that the development of animal husbandry in our region is relatively fast, but if it were not for this situation of diversified economy, could there be this speed of development? It is definitely impossible. Therefore, more Han people are good for the construction of the autonomous region, for the construction of the country, and for the Mongolian nationality.

Local nationalists believe that the slogan "opposing assimilation" can incite the people of the Inner Mongolia nationality to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose socialism. In the era of reactionary rule, great-Han chauvinists once adopted a "assimilation" policy towards the Inner Mongolia nationality. Therefore, it is understandable that some people have a fear of being assimilated. The "assimilation" policy is the policy of the ruling reactionary rulers to eliminate the oppressed nationalities from the political, economic, and cultural aspects. Not only is it opposed by minority nationalities, but it is also resolutely opposed by the Chinese Communist Party. This is personally seen by the people of the Inner Mongolia nationality.

Local nationalists distort the facts and say that after liberation, the Mongolian language has developed in some aspects, but has regressed in others. What they refer to as development in some aspects is that a team of Mongolian language workers has been trained, and hundreds of thousands of Mongolian books have been published. But can the development of some aspects be completely separated from the development of other aspects? Are these books for Mongolian language workers to read, or for the general public to read? Is this team of Mongolian language workers working for themselves, or working for the masses? In fact, the development of some aspects is precisely the prime mover of the development of other aspects, and it is precisely for the sake of the development of other aspects. According to rough statistics for the first half of the year, there are more than 120,000 Mongolian students in school, most of whom are taught in the Mongolian language, and more than 129,000 farmers and herdsmen participate in Mongolian literacy classes. Every day, Mongolian newspapers, broadcasts, and publications educate the masses. What is this if not the development of other aspects? In fact, the Mongolian language has been greatly developed after liberation, rather than regressed.

Why do local nationalists distort the facts and reverse black and white like this? They attempt to seize the psychology of some people who are afraid of being assimilated, and open a gap from this place to comprehensively oppose national unity, oppose the Communist Party, and oppose socialism. After they have cited various arguments of "being assimilated," they will naturally come to the conclusion: to oppose assimilation, Mongolian and Han must be separated and live in two unit areas; to oppose assimilation, "Inner Mongolia must be independent" and must be separated from the People's Republic of China; to oppose assimilation, it is necessary to oppose industrial construction and oppose the construction of railways; to oppose assimilation, it is necessary to oppose the establishment of economic and cultural centers in pastoral areas and oppose the establishment of feed bases; to oppose assimilation, it is necessary to oppose the establishment of ethnic joint cooperatives, and so on. In short, because "the more progress is made, the more the nation is diluted, and by the time of socialism, the Mongolian nation will be completely Hanified," therefore, to oppose assimilation, it is necessary to oppose socialism. This is the true face of local nationalists among the Mongolian nationality. Local nationalists are essentially bourgeois rightists. Together with the national bourgeois rightists, they oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose national unity, and oppose socialist construction from the perspective of ethnic issues. This is their class essence and political purpose.

Ulanhu said that local nationalism among the Mongolian nationality is the main danger of local nationalism in the autonomous region. However, we should also point out that the local nationalism of other minority nationalities is also quite serious. The local nationalism of some cadres of the Daur nationality has developed to such an extent that in order to establish an autonomous prefecture, the Molidawa Banner Party Committee did not implement the decision of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee to establish a Daur ethnic county-level autonomous organ in Molidawa Banner, and even made the banner People's Congress pass a resolution to establish an autonomous prefecture that was contrary to the decision of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee. There are more than 40,000 Daur people in our region and Heilongjiang Province, with 21,000 in the Inner Mongolia region, 14,000 of whom live in Molidawa Banner, and the rest are scattered in other banners. They demand the establishment of an autonomous prefecture regardless of the objective situation of a small population and scattered living. Based on various conditions, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee disagreed with their opinions and decided to establish a Daur ethnic county-level autonomous organ in Molidawa Banner. However, the Molidawa Banner Party Committee did not implement this decision, but instead made the banner People's Congress pass a resolution to establish an autonomous prefecture. This is a serious error caused by the development of local nationalism.

While opposing local nationalism, it is still necessary to overcome the tendency to ignore ethnic and regional characteristics.

Ulanhu said that while opposing local nationalism, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Party's ethnic policies. We have basically done well in implementing ethnic policies, but there are also many shortcomings and errors. Some cadres still have a tendency to ignore ethnic and regional characteristics in some work; in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, there have also been phenomena that violate the policy of "prohibiting reclamation and protecting pastures"; the reasonable arrangement and mutual benefit of members of various nationalities in ethnic joint cooperatives have not been fully resolved; there is still insufficient mutual respect for customs and habits among ethnic members, and phenomena of exclusion and insufficient trust still exist; some organs and cadres still do not pay enough attention to the study and use of ethnic languages; the training of ethnic cadres cannot fully meet the needs of the work; and the development of the economy and culture of minority nationalities in the region lacks overall planning. During the rectification stage, a period of time should be specifically set aside to check the implementation of ethnic policies. In checking the implementation of ethnic policies, it is necessary to check and overcome great-Han chauvinist ideological tendencies.

Ulanhu finally said that both types of nationalism are reflections of the bourgeois world outlook on ethnic issues. To effectively oppose both great-Han chauvinist and local nationalist ideological tendencies, it is necessary to strengthen the education of the communist world outlook, the communist view of nationality, and internationalist patriotism, and it is necessary to strengthen the education of ethnic policies.

    祖国的统一　民族的团结　党的领导——
    各民族发展进步繁荣兴旺的保证
    乌兰夫在内蒙古自治区党代表会上作反对地方民族主义的报告
    本报特约新华社呼和浩特25日电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫在最近举行的中共内蒙古自治区第一届代表大会第二次会议的报告中，对内蒙古自治区地方民族主义言行进行了批判。
    乌兰夫说，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，在内蒙古自治区突出地表现在马列主义民族观与资产阶级民族主义思想的斗争上。党一向反对任何妨碍民族团结的大民族主义倾向和地方民族主义倾向，特别注意在汉族的党员和国家工作人员中防止和纠正大汉族主义倾向。我们曾经几次进行民族政策执行情况的检查，我们经常地反复地教育党员和国家工作人员，一切工作都要注意民族特点、地区特点，反对生搬硬套的作风。这些斗争的锋芒都是针对着大民族主义思想倾向的。在整改中，在民族政策执行情况的检查中，仍然要继续批判大民族主义思想倾向，只要资产阶级和资产阶级思想影响存在一天，这种思想倾向就会存在一天。所以，防止和纠正大民族主义思想倾向仍然是我们今后长期的政治任务。
    地方民族主义已成为当前主要危险，必须坚决反对和批判。
    乌兰夫说，近一两年来，在社会主义革命的不断胜利中，资产阶级及其他剥削阶级不服气，企图挣扎反抗，这种情况就不能不反映到某些蒙古族及其他少数民族的知识分子、国家工作人员、甚至一部分党员的思想中来。因此，地方民族主义有了新的滋长。在去年资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，蒙古族和其他少数民族的地方民族主义者也在民族问题上向党猖狂进攻。他们从民族关系上，从党的民族政策上来反对党的领导，反对社会主义，企图使蒙古民族及其他少数民族脱离中国共产党的领导，脱离社会主义道路。很明显，地方民族主义已经成为当前的主要危险，必须坚决反对和批判。在内蒙古全区来说，绝大部分的蒙古族及其他少数民族干部是好的，地方民族主义者为数是极少的，而且在党内和国家机关中不占重要地位。但是，就地方民族主义思想倾向来说，在蒙古族及其他少数民族的知识分子和国家工作人员中，在不同程度上相当普遍地存在着，这是由于一部分人还保持着资产阶级世界观，大多数人对民族问题的看法，对民族关系问题的处理，还缺乏阶级观点和阶级分析的方法。所以，他们在这一个或在那一个问题的看法上，就可能成为民族主义者的俘虏。这样，有民族主义思想倾向的人，他们的民族主义思想倾向如果不加以批判，切实纠正，任其发展下去，也可能成为资产阶级民族主义者。应该指出，有地方民族主义思想倾向的人与地方民族主义者在性质上是不同的。地方民族主义思想倾向是思想问题，是人民内部矛盾的一个方面。地方民族主义者在实质上是资产阶级右派。对地方民族主义者反党反社会主义破坏祖国统一民族团结的言论行动必须坚决地严格地予以批判，但是除了其中极恶毒的分子以外，一般的我们仍然按照人民内部矛盾来处理。对有地方民族主义倾向的人应该适当批评，采取团结—批评—团结的公式，使他们改变资产阶级的民族观。
    乌兰夫对地方民族主义的几个基本观点一一进行了批判：
    反对民族团结，就是破坏祖国统一，从而也破坏了民族的利益。
    地方民族主义者主张民族分裂，反对民族团结。他们主张以现在的半农半牧区为界限，把自治区分成蒙族区和汉族区，把蒙汉杂居区的蒙古人都搬到牧区，把区外蒙古人搬到自治区来。他们说，中国不是蒙古人的祖国，主张把内蒙古从祖国大家庭分离出去。他们主张汉文不能作为自治区通用文字之一。他们捏造所谓蒙汉民族“一贯斗争论”，而看不到蒙汉劳动人民和平相助，看不到蒙汉民族共同命运，共同斗争，看不到中华人民共和国成立后新的民族关系的形成。
    我们知道，内蒙古蒙汉劳动人民由于长期相处，经济互助，文化交流，形成了不可分离的密切联系。几百年前就有汉人来此居住，从事手工业、商业、农业，带来了文化和技术，促进了经济的发展。固然，在大汉族主义的反动统治时代，曾经对蒙古民族实行统治、掠夺、分割同化政策，使蒙古人民遭到深重的灾难；但是就在那个期间蒙汉劳动人民仍有经济互助、文化交流和政治团结的一面。由于长期历史的发展，今天，内蒙古地区有三十多万蒙古人民聚居的广大牧区，有八十多万蒙古族、六百多万汉族及达呼尔族、朝鲜族和其他少数民族的农民杂居的农业区和半农半牧区，另外还有近百个民族杂居的城镇，并且有三千三百多公里铁路和一万三千多公里公路相联，形成了工业、农业、牧业不可分离的整体。这是内蒙古经济的整体，是民族关系的整体。
    内蒙古自治区在历史上、地域上、经济上、政治上、文化上是祖国不可分割的一部分，它与祖国有京包路、包兰路、滨州路和华北、西北、东北相连。它每年以大批粮食、牲畜、皮毛、乳制品、盐、碱及其他矿产品供应全国；全国各地又以布匹百货及其他工业品供应自治区。
    从政治方面说，从帝国主义入侵中国近一百一十年期间，蒙汉人民就共同陷于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫剥削之下，他们有着共同的反帝反封建的要求，这一共同的命运和共同的政治要求，使他们在政治上团结起来，共同进行了民族民主革命。特别是中国共产党成立后，蒙汉各族人民在中国共产党的领导下，肩并肩地进行了长期的斗争。在国内战争中，在抗日战争中，许多蒙汉各族人民的优秀儿女的血凝结在一起。蒙汉人民长期同生死共患难，终于在党的领导下取得了革命的胜利。
    中华人民共和国成立，国民党反动统治被推翻，以工人阶级为领导以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政建立，国内民族关系发生了根本的改变。民族平等团结互助代替了民族压迫。在进行了民主改革和社会主义改造的地区，各民族内部的剥削阶级被消灭或正在被消灭，民族压迫的阶级根源也就消灭了和正在消灭着。今天各民族之间的关系，就是共产党领导下的兄弟般的平等友爱、互助的关系。
    蒙古人民从长期的经验中深刻地认识到，只有蒙汉族人民团结起来，才能取得革命的胜利，取得民族的解放；只有团结才能建设社会主义，才有民族的兴旺繁荣。
    民族团结是民族关系的最高原则。“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定胜利的基本保证。”破坏民族团结就是破坏祖国的统一，就是破坏社会主义建设，就是破坏民族利益。可以想像，如果使地方民族主义者的反动企图得逞，内蒙古民族将会陷于何等悲惨的境地。
    共产党是工人阶级的统一的先进部队，不能把党按照民族成份划分开来。
    地方民族主义者还恶毒地歪曲党的性质，攻击党的领导，他们把党不看作是工人阶级的阶级组织的最高形式，不是马克思列宁主义的统一，而是把党按照民族成分划分开来。他们认为只有本民族的人，才能懂得民族情感，才能代表民族利益，汉族党员是大汉族主义者，觉悟高的忠于党、忠于社会主义事业的民族党员都是民族“叛徒”。他们污蔑内蒙古党委是大民族主义，他们恶毒地说：“内蒙古的大民族主义像流行性感冒一样，到处流行。”这是对党的性质和党的民族政策的诬蔑。
    “中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队，是工人阶级的阶级组织的最高形式。”它的成员不论是什么民族成分，都必须具有无产阶级的立场、观点，都必须以马克思列宁主义作为行动的指南，都必须在党中央和各级党组织领导下进行工作。共产党是以马克思列宁主义为指南的工人阶级的统一的先进部队，不是各民族各阶级的联盟。不能把党按照民族成分划分开来。
    工人阶级要解放自己，必须解放全人类。中国共产党不仅代表工人阶级的利益，也代表全体劳动人民和国内各民族人民的利益。它没有与工人阶级、全体劳动人民、各民族人民利益不同的利益。而且只有中国共产党才能代表各民族人民的利益。
    我们共产党人认为，民族是一定历史时期的产物，它像任何事物都有它的发生、发展和衰亡一样，它也有它自己发生、发展、衰亡的过程。但是，民族的逐渐衰亡，民族界限的逐渐消失，是在各方面高度发展的共产主义社会的事，是一个自然发展过程，不是人为的过程。我们应该强调指出，只要民族界限存在一天，我们就必须重视民族特点，按照民族特点来正确运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。“一个无产阶级政党，如果忽视了民族特点，就必然脱离生活，脱离群众，就必然会使社会主义事业遭到损失。”我们党的政策是充分发展各民族的政治经济文化，消灭历史上遗留下的经济文化落后状态，使各民族跻于社会主义民族的行列。中共党章总纲中说：“中国共产党必须用特别的努力来改善各少数民族的地位，帮助各少数民族的自治，努力培养少数民族的干部，促进各少数民族的经济和文化的发展，实现各民族的完全平等，巩固各民族的团结友爱关系。各民族的社会改革，应当由各民族按照自己的愿望，采取适合自己的民族特点的步骤去完成。党反对任何妨碍民族团结的大民族主义倾向和地方民族主义倾向，特别应当注意在汉民族的党员和国家工作人员中防止和纠正大汉族主义的倾向。”这就是中国共产党对国内少数民族的基本纲领。
    中国共产党领导内蒙古人民所取得的伟大成就，使每个人都会认识到，只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能结束内蒙古民族几百年来的分割状态，建立起统一的自治区；只有在中国共产党领导下，才能求得民族解放，才能取得民主改革和社会主义改造的胜利，才能消灭剥削阶级；只有在中国共产党领导下，才有今天经济文化的大发展，才有今天和明天的幸福更幸福的生活。大量的事实说明了，只有中国共产党才是中国各民族利益的代表者。
    中国共产党一向是大力培养民族干部的。但是，党认为，只有把民族干部培养成为忠于工人阶级、劳动人民和社会主义事业的干部，他才能真正成为民族利益和民族情感的代表者。一切保持资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的立场观点的人，是不能代表民族利益和民族情感的。
  地方民族主义者借口“反对同化”，实质上是反对社会主义。
    地方民族主义者更恶毒地全面地攻击党的各项政策，反对社会主义改造和社会主义建设。他们企图把内蒙古人民拖出社会主义轨道，恢复到民族分裂、民族落后衰退的道路上去。
    地方民族主义者的最基本口号是“反对同化”，最基本的论据是“蒙汉人口的比例是一比七”。
    在内蒙古自治区内，蒙汉人口一比七的比例，是长期的历史发展的结果。在今天他们之间的关系是以工人阶级为首的劳动人民之间的关系。正是因为在一百四十万平方公里的土地上，有七百多万汉人和一百多万蒙古人及其他少数民族和平相处，团结建设，才形成内蒙古今天这样各种经济相互支援相互发展的局面。谁都知道我区牧业发展较快，但如果不是在这种多种经济的形势下，能不能有这个发展速度呢？肯定是不可能的。所以，汉人多对自治区建设，对国家建设，对蒙古民族都是好事。
    地方民族主义者认为“反对同化”这个口号可以煽惑内蒙古民族人民来反对共产党领导，反对社会主义。在反动统治时代，大汉族主义者曾经对内蒙古民族采取过“同化”政策。所以，有些人产生一种怕被同化的心理是可以理解的。“同化”政策是压迫民族的反动统治者从政治、经济、文化上消灭被压迫民族的政策，不仅是少数民族反对的，也是中国共产党一向坚决反对的，这是内蒙古民族人民亲自看到的。
    地方民族主义者歪曲事实说：解放后蒙古语文在点上发展了，在面上倒退了。他们指的点上发展了，是指培养了一支蒙古语文工作者队伍，出了几十万册蒙文书。但点的发展与面的发展能够截然分开吗？这些书是为蒙文工作者看的呢？还是要为广大群众读的呢？这一支蒙文工作者队伍是为自己而工作，还是要为群众而工作呢？事实上点的发展正是面的发展的原动机，正是为着面的发展。据上半年粗略统计，在校蒙古学生有十二万多人，他们中的绝大部分都以蒙古语文授课，有十二万九千多农牧民参加蒙文扫盲。每天都有蒙文报纸、广播、出版物对群众进行教育，这不是面是什么呢？事实上，蒙古语文在解放后是大大发展了，而不是倒退了。
    为什么地方民族主义者这样歪曲事实，颠倒黑白呢？他们企图抓住一部分人怕被同化的心理，从这个地方打开个缺口，来全面地反对民族团结，反对共产党，反对社会主义。在他们举了种种“被同化”的论据之后，他们就会自然得出这样的结论：要反对同化，就要蒙汉分开，分住两个单元区；要反对同化，就要“内蒙古独立”，就要脱离中华人民共和国；要反对同化就要反对工业建设，反对修筑铁路；要反对同化就要反对在牧区建立经济文化中心点，反对建立饲料基地；要反对同化就要反对建立民族联合社等等。总之，因为“越进步越冲淡民族，到社会主义蒙古民族也就汉化完了”，所以要反对同化，就要反对社会主义了。这就是蒙古族中的地方民族主义者的真面目。地方民族主义者实质上是资产阶级右派分子。他们与全国资产阶级右派一起，从民族问题方面来反对共产党的领导，反对民族团结，反对社会主义建设。这就是他们的阶级实质和政治目的。
    乌兰夫说，蒙古族中的地方民族主义是自治区地方民族主义的主要危险。但是，我们也应当指出其他少数民族的地方民族主义也是相当严重的。达呼尔族一部分干部的地方民族主义发展到这样地步，他们为了要建立自治州，以致莫力达瓦旗的党委会不执行内蒙古党委在莫力达瓦旗建立达呼尔族县一级自治机关的决定，而且使旗人民代表大会通过了与内蒙古党委的决定相反的建立自治州的决议。达呼尔族在我区和黑龙江省共有四万多人，在内蒙古地区有两万一千人，有一万四千人住在莫力达瓦旗，其余的都散居在其他各旗。他们不顾人少而又散居的客观情况，要求建立自治州。内蒙古党委根据各方面条件，不同意他们的意见，决定在莫力达瓦旗建立达呼尔族县一级自治机关，但是，莫力达瓦旗旗委没有执行这个决定，反而使旗人民代表大会通过了建立自治州的决议。这是地方民族主义发展所产生的严重错误。
    反对地方民族主义的同时，仍要克服忽视民族特点和地区特点的倾向。
    乌兰夫说，在反对地方民族主义的同时，要认真地贯彻执行党的民族政策。我们在执行民族政策上，基本上是好的，但也有许多缺点和错误。一部分干部在某些工作上仍有忽视民族特点和地区特点的倾向；在半农半牧区，还曾有违反“禁止开荒、保护牧场”政策的现象；民族联合社中各民族社员的合理安排和互利问题还没有得到完全解决；民族社员之间互相尊重风俗习惯还不够，排斥和不够信任的现象还存在；对于民族语文的学习与使用，有些机关和干部还有不重视的现象；民族干部的培养还不能完全适应工作的需要；区内少数民族经济文化的发展还缺乏全面规划。在整改阶段中，应当专门划出一段时间检查民族政策的执行情况。在检查民族政策的执行情况中，要检查和克服大民族主义思想倾向。
    乌兰夫最后说，两种民族主义都是资产阶级世界观在民族问题上的反映，要有效地反对大民族主义和地方民族主义两种思想倾向，必须加强共产主义世界观、共产主义民族观和国际主义爱国主义的教育，必须加强民族政策的教育。
