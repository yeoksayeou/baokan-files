Xinhua News Agency report: The initiative proposed by the workers of Beijing Tianqiao Department Store and Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store to promote a great leap forward in commercial work has gone beyond the scope of Beijing and has been enthusiastically responded to by workers in many city stores.

Many stores in Zhengzhou and Chongqing launched a campaign to "Learn from Tianqiao, Catch up with Tianqiao, and Leap over Tianqiao." The workers in the Zhengzhou commercial system generally studied the experience of the Tianqiao Department Store and proposed: "What Tianqiao can do, we can do too." The workers of the Transportation Wholesale Department of the Municipal Industrial Equipment Company decided to reduce the number of 36 staff members by 14, while requiring a 50% increase in sales compared to last year. The workers of the Municipal Joint State-Private Department Store decided to reduce personnel by 46%, implement a one-shift system to the end; increase the capital turnover from 8.36 times last year to 12.12 times, and reduce expenses by 25.5% from the original plan, etc.

The workers of the Central Store of Chongqing Department Store Company, the Joint State-Private Shizhong District Cotton Cloth Store, and the Shijingpo Trading Store, after continuous discussions and the convening of worker representative conferences, successively set leap forward targets to surpass Tianqiao. In their proposals, these stores all put forward four leap forward indicators: reducing personnel, improving labor efficiency, adjusting working hours, implementing a one-shift system to the end, accelerating capital turnover, saving expenses, and improving service quality.

The workers of the largest department store in Guangzhou, the Xidi Store of the State-owned Department Store Company, and the workers of the Jiefang Street Department Store in Hangzhou, have all proposed work innovation plans, responding to the initiative of the Tianqiao Department Store on the one hand, and challenging commercial workers in their respective provinces and cities on the other. The workers of the Xidi Department Store in Guangzhou put forward six conditions, including: ensuring the completion of this year's sales plan, striving to overfulfill the profit delivery plan, increasing the profit delivery by 324,000 yuan compared to last year, and saving 380,000 yuan in circulation expenses compared to last year; actively supporting industrial production, vigorously promoting local industrial products, doing a good job in the trial sales of local new industrial products, extensively soliciting consumer opinions, and establishing a regular contact system with local factories and communes to assist them in improving production, improving product quality, and reducing costs.

In Harbin, the workers of the First, Seventh, and Women's and Children's Products Department Stores also studied overnight how to promote the revolutionary measures of the Tianqiao Department Store to improve work. On the 15th, the First Department Store organized the knitwear group and the hardware and electrical materials group to test the one-shift-to-the-end working method. The test results showed that the number of salespersons could be reduced by more than half. Qiao Shuhua, a labor model of the Seventh Department Store, set a plan to catch up with the service level of Wu Guilan, the national commercial labor model, in the second quarter.

    学“天桥”　赶“天桥”
    许多城市商店订出跃进计划
    据新华社讯　北京天桥百货商场和米市大街副食品商店职工提出的促进商业工作大跃进的倡议，已经突破北京市的范围，得到许多城市商店职工的热烈响应。
    郑州市和重庆市许多商店展开了“学习天桥、赶上天桥、跃过天桥”的运动。郑州市商业系统的职工普遍学习了天桥百货商场的经验，提出：“天桥能做到，我们也能做到。”市工业器材公司交通批发部职工，决定把三十六个工作人员减少十四人，而营业额要求比去年增加50％。市公私合营百货总店职工，决定减少人员46％，实行一班顶到底；资金周转从去年的八点三六一次提高到一二点一二次，费用开支比原计划下降25.5％等。
    重庆市百货公司中心商店、公私合营市中区棉布商店及石井坡贸易商店的职工，经过连续的座谈和召开职工代表大会，先后订出了赛过天桥的跃进指标。这些商店在倡议书中都提出了减少人员、提高劳动效率，调整工时、一班到底，加速资金周转、节约费用开支和提高服务质量四项跃进指标。
    广州市最大的百货商店——国营百货公司西堤商店和杭州市解放街百货商店的职工，都提出革新工作的方案，一面响应天桥百货商场的倡议，一面向本省、本市的商业工作人员挑战。广州市西堤百货商店的职工提出了六项条件，其中包括有：保证完成今年销售计划，争取超额完成上缴利润计划，上缴利润比去年增加三十二万四千元，流转费用比去年节约三十八万元；积极支援工业生产，大力推销当地工业产品，做好当地新工业产品的试销工作，广泛征求消费者意见，同当地厂、社建立定期的联系制度，协助它们改进生产，提高产品质量，降低成本等项。
    在哈尔滨市，第一、第七和妇女儿童用品等百货商店的职工，也连夜研究如何推广天桥百货商场改进工作的革命措施。第一百货商店在15日组织了针织组和五金电料组试验一班到底的工作方法，试验结果，可以减少营业员一半以上。第七百货商店劳动模范乔淑华订出了在第二季度赶上全国商业劳动模范吴桂兰的服务水平的规划。
