About the American Satellite
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Several months after the Soviet Union successfully launched two artificial Earth satellites one after the other, the United States also sent a small artificial Earth satellite into outer space orbit on February 1 this year. Because the United States is still relatively backward in rocket technology, the weight of the American satellite and the height it reaches in outer space cannot be compared with those of the Soviet satellites.
    The United States is a highly developed industrial country, and it is not unexpected that it has finally been able to send an artificial satellite into space. When the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, met with American journalist Reston on October 7 last year, he said: "If the United States does not have rockets today, then you will have them in the future, because science is constantly developing." The tool for carrying artificial satellites into space is rockets; once the United States has rockets with sufficient thrust, it can certainly launch artificial satellites. However, the "Jupiter-C" rocket that sent the first American artificial satellite into space is only a medium-range rocket, not a powerful intercontinental ballistic missile like the ones possessed by the Soviet Union.
    The United States has named its satellite "Explorer." In fact, the first and second satellites launched by the Soviet Union had already "explored" outer space. The American satellite, no matter what, is late. Of course, if the purpose of launching artificial Earth satellites is for the scientific goal of mankind conquering the universe, it is beneficial for countries to compete with each other. Because competition can promote the further development of science and technology.
    However, it must be seen that the American ruling group is trying to use the launch of satellites as a means to salvage their bankrupt "policy of strength." Since the Soviet Union launched two satellites, the "prestige" of the United States in the Western world has been swept away, and the American ruling group has impatiently launched several satellites, but all have failed.
    This successful launch of the American satellite appears to be a bargaining chip for the American ruling group to try to regroup and vigorously promote its "policy of strength." But in any case, in recent months, even American scientists have admitted that American science and technology is definitely behind the Soviet Union in key sectors. This cannot be remedied by launching one or even several satellites. The bankruptcy of the American policy of strength and the rising calls for peace from the people of all countries are the general trend, and no force can stop it.

　　关于美国的卫星
　　本报评论员
    在苏联两个人造地球卫星相继上天几个月之后，美国于今年2月1日也把一个小的人造地球卫星送上了外层空间的轨道。由于美国在火箭技术方面还比较落后，所以美国卫星的重量和进入外层空间的高度还不能与苏联的卫星相比。
    美国是一个高度发达的工业国，它终于能够把一个人造卫星送上天去，这并不是什么出乎人们意料的事情。苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在去年10月7日接见美国记者赖斯顿的时候，就曾说过：“如果美国今天还没有火箭的话，那么将来你们也会有的，因为科学在不断发展着。”把人造卫星携带上天的工具是火箭；美国一旦有了足够推动力的火箭，当然就可以发射出人造卫星。不过，把美国的第一个人造卫星送上天的“丘辟特—C”式火箭，还只是一种中程火箭，而不是像苏联拥有的强大的洲际弹道火箭。
    美国把它的这个卫星命名为“探险者”，其实，到外层空间“探险”的，早有苏联发射的第一颗和第二颗卫星了，美国的卫星无论怎样说也是迟到了。当然，如果发射人造地球卫星是为了人类征服宇宙的科学目的，各国之间进行竞赛是有好处的。因为，通过竞赛将可以推动科学技术的进一步发展。
    然而，必须看到：美国统治集团是企图把发射卫星作为挽救他们的早已破了产的“实力政策”的手段的。因为，自从苏联发射了两颗卫星以来，美国在西方世界中“威信”扫地，美国统治集团就迫不及待地发射了几次卫星，但都失败了。
    美国卫星这次发射成功，看来将要成为美国统治集团企图重振旗鼓、大肆鼓吹其“实力政策”的本钱。但是，无论如何，最近几个月来，甚至连美国的科学家也承认，美国的科学技术在关键性的部门方面，肯定是落在苏联后面了。这不是发射一颗以至几颗卫星所能挽回得了的。美国实力政策的破产，各国人民要求和平的呼声的高涨，已是大势所趋，再没有什么力量可以阻挡得住的了。
