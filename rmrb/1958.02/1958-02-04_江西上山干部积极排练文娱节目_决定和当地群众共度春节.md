Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 1st – Cadres from Jiangxi Province who have been sent to various mountain reclamation farms are recently using their evening rest time to rehearse cultural programs, preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival with the masses in the local areas. Cadres from the Yunshan Reclamation Farm and the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm have even created literary and artistic programs reflecting their own labor and lives.

The cadres sent to various mountainous areas have recently expressed that they will not return to their original hometowns or original offices for the Spring Festival, in order to further strengthen their relationship with the masses through Spring Festival cultural activities, and also to save the state's transportation capacity and reduce personal expenses. The cadres sent to Yunshan in Yongxiu have also expressed their intention to plant 70,000 trees and reclaim 500 mu of wasteland before the Spring Festival. The cadres sent to the Dongxiang Red Star Reclamation Farm plan to take advantage of the Spring Festival to further carry out a full-scale campaign to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and accumulate fertilizer.

    决定和当地群众共度春节
    新华社南昌1日电　江西省下放到各山区垦殖场的干部们最近正在利用晚上的休息时间排练文娱节目，准备在当地和群众一起欢度春节。云山垦殖场和大茅山垦殖场的干部还编排了反映自己劳动生活的文艺节目。
    下放到各个山区的干部最近都表示不回原籍、原机关过春节，以便通过春节的文娱活动进一步密切同群众的关系，并且节省国家的运输力和节约个人的开支。下放到永修云山的干部们还表示要在春节前植树造林七万株，开荒五百亩。下放到东乡红星垦殖场的干部们计划利用春节进一步开展全场性的除四害、讲卫生和积肥运动。
