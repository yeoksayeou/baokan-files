    New Performances During the Spring Festival

    Play "Song of Youth"
    The China Youth Art Theater recently performed a new play, "Song of Youth," which focuses on young intellectuals going to the countryside to participate in labor training. The play mainly depicts two university graduates: one who goes to the countryside to build a new socialist countryside, lives and works with the peasants, and finally becomes a new type of intellectual, contributing to the country in both work and academic research; the other who goes to the countryside with strong individualistic ideas, detached from reality and aloof, attempting to become famous overnight by writing a thesis, but achieves nothing.
    This new play reflecting real-life struggles will be a vivid lesson for intellectuals to correct their attitudes toward going to the countryside and mountains to participate in labor training. (Zhang Fuji)

    Vocal Concert
    The Central Philharmonic Society's Sunday concerts have been varied in form and rich in content since last year, and are very popular with music lovers. During the Spring Festival, their vocal concert will focus on introducing some famous songs from the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, as well as folk songs adapted into songs; in addition, there will be a large-scale "Flying Tiger Mountain Story Chorus." In particular, these songs from the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War once inspired the masses to oppose Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and became their weapons in the struggle. Hearing them today will undoubtedly feel particularly intimate. (Zhu)

    Documentary "A Hundred Flowers Bloom"
    The name of the film "A Hundred Flowers Bloom" shows its colorful content. It records twenty wonderful programs from eleven countries that visited China in 1957 for performances, including Schubert's "Passion" performed by Soviet pianist Richter; "Don Quixote" and "Swan Lake" performed by the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater of the Soviet Union; the "Bamboo Hat Dance," the female chorus "Sister La's Thoughts," and a solo on the ethnic instrument gourd lute performed by the State Art Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; the "Csárdás Dance" and the folk song "Listen, My Rose" performed by the Debrecen Folk Song and Dance Ensemble of the People's Republic of Hungary; the "Mongolian Dance" and the folk song "Rich Mongolia" performed by the Mongolian People's Republic State Music and Drama Theater Art Troupe; a piano, violin, and cello trio and a harp solo performed by the Czechoslovak Musician Delegation; the "Serbian Dance" performed by the Branko Krsmanović Choir of Yugoslavia; the "BattiMurala Hero Dance" and the Hawaiian guitar "Paddle Fast, Paddle Fast" performed by the Indonesian Maluku Art Troupe; the "Blessing Dance" and an ensemble of ethnic instruments by the Cambodian Cultural and Art Delegation; and programs performed by the British Lambert Ballet and the Mexican Modern Ballet.
    The directors of the film are Su Heqing and Wang Chen. The cinematographers are Wang Zhaoyi and Li Hua, among others. (Jian Yan)

    Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe Performs in Beijing
    Yu Zhenfei, principal of the Shanghai Opera School and a famous Xiaosheng actor, along with his Kunqu Opera class students and some actors from the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe, will begin a short public performance in Beijing starting on the 13th. The Kunqu Opera programs they bring include "The Generals at Baihua Point," "Yaotai," "Meeting the Mother," and the complete, revised version of "The Peony Pavilion." Kunqu Opera actors Hua Chuanhao, Zhu Chuanming, Zheng Chuanjian, and Peking Opera actors Yan Huizhu, Li Yuru, and Zhang Meijuan will perform "The Drunken Concubine," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "Blocking the Horse," and "Borrowing the Fan." These programs have been rigorously artistically refined and have been well-received in Shanghai and abroad. (Shi)

    Feature Film "Backstage"
    Beside a railway line, an old man and a young girl are trekking on foot. They are father and daughter. The father, Sinichkin, is an excellent actor, but because he has no powerful patrons, he has been unknown for decades. Now he is looking for an opportunity for his daughter, Lisa, to show off her talent. The Soviet film "Backstage" depicts the experiences of this pair of artist father and daughter in Tsarist Russia.
    The plot of the film is very delicate and tortuous. In a city, the theater is rehearsing a new play. The female lead in the play is very suitable for Lisa to play; however, the theater's original star, Raika, monopolizes all the leading roles and does not let others play them. Another annoying thing is: Raika's lover – a duke – has taken a fancy to Lisa and writes her boring letters! Finally, Sinichkin comes up with a brilliant plan, he finds a way to send the letter to Raika, so that she goes to the Duke's appointment, so the role she plays has to be replaced by Lisa. Although the Duke and Raika are furious after discovering they have been deceived, their revenge did not succeed, and Lisa's performance was finally successful and praised by the audience.
    The film ends with a comedic plot, but this smile contains tears. It speaks out for talented people who have been buried, and it accuses the dark old society! (Bi)

    Two New Plays by the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe
    The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe will stage two new plays, "Zha Judge" and "Consort Zhen," during the Spring Festival. "Zha Judge" is adapted from "Exploring Yin Mountain." The play highlights the darkness of the so-called "underworld" in feudal times and negates the saying that good and evil are rewarded. Some past superstitious and other bad performances have been removed. In the play "Consort Zhen," Zhang Junqiu has created many new arias to satisfy some audiences who love Peking Opera singing. Both plays also use simple scenery and lighting. For example, in "Zha Judge," the scene where the little ghosts peek at the judge secretly changing the book of life and death has a good effect on the plot due to the appropriate use of stage art.

    春节里有些什么新的演出
    话剧“青春之歌”
    中国青年艺术剧院最近演出了以青年知识分子下乡参加劳动锻炼为题材的新戏——“青春之歌”。剧中主要描写了两个大学毕业生，一个下乡是为了建设社会主义的新农村，他和农民一起生活、劳动，最后终于锻炼成为一个新型的知识分子，并在工作和学术研究上对祖国作出了贡献；另一个却带着浓厚的个人主义思想下乡，脱离实际，高高在上，企图以写论文来一举成名，结果毫无所获。
    这个反映现实斗争生活的新剧目对知识分子端正下乡上山参加劳动锻炼的态度将是生动的一课。　（张付吉）
    声乐音乐会
    中央乐团的星期音乐会，自去年以来，形式多种多样，内容丰富，很受到喜爱音乐的听众的欢迎。春节期间，他们举行的声乐音乐会将比较集中的介绍一些抗日战争、解放战争时期的著名歌曲和民歌改编歌曲；此外，还有大型的“飞虎山故事大合唱”。其中，特别是抗日战争和解放战争时期的这些歌曲，曾经鼓舞了广大群众反日反蒋的情绪，并成为他们在斗争中的武器，今天听来一定会感到分外亲切。

    纪录片“百花争艳”
    影片“百花争艳”这个名字，显示了它花团锦簇的内容。它纪录了1957年来我国访问演出的十一个国家的二十个精彩的节目，其中有苏联钢琴家李赫特尔表演的舒伯特的“激情”；苏联新西伯利亚歌舞剧芭蕾舞剧院表演的“唐·吉诃德”和“天鹅湖”；越南民主共和国国家文工团表演的“竹笠舞”，女声齐唱“菈大姐的心事”，民族乐器葫芦琴独奏；匈牙利人民共和国德布利森民间歌舞团的“恰尔达斯舞”和民歌“听着，我的玫瑰花”；蒙古人民共和国国家音乐话剧院艺术团表演的“蒙古舞”和民歌“富饶的蒙古”；捷克斯洛伐克音乐家代表团表演的钢琴、小提琴、大提琴三重奏和竖琴独奏；南斯拉夫伯朗柯·克里斯曼诺维奇歌舞团表演的“塞尔维亚舞”；印度尼西亚马鲁古艺术团的“巴蒂慕拉英雄舞”和哈瓦依吉他“快划、快划”，柬埔寨文化艺术代表团的“祝福舞”和民族乐器合奏；以及英国蓝伯特芭蕾舞剧团和墨西哥现代芭蕾舞团表演的节目等。
    影片的导演是苏河清、王琛。摄影师是王兆义、李华等。

    上海京剧院来京演出
    上海戏曲学校校长、著名小生俞振飞和他的昆曲班学生以及上海京剧院部分演员，自13日开始在北京作短期的公演。他们带来的昆曲剧目有“百花点将”、“瑶台”、“见娘”及经过整理的全本“牡丹亭”等。昆曲“传”字辈演员华传浩、朱传茗、郑传鉴和京剧演员言慧珠、李玉茹、张美娟等将演出“贵妃醉酒”、“拾玉镯”、“挡马”、“借扇”等剧目，这些剧目在艺术上经过严格的加工，在上海及国外演出时都曾得到好评。　（石）
    故事片“舞台前后”
    在一条铁路旁边，一个老头和一个少女正徒步跋涉着。他们是父女俩。父亲西尼契金是一个优秀的演员，但是因为没有权贵捧场，几十年来他一直默默无闻。现在他正在为女儿里莎寻找一个机会，使她的表演天才能展现出来。苏联影片“舞台前后”便是描写帝俄时期这一对艺人父女的遭遇的影片。
    影片情节十分细腻曲折。在一个城市里，剧院正在排一个新剧目。剧中女主角是非常适合里莎扮演的；然而剧院原来的红演员拉伊卡却独霸了一切戏的主角不让别人演。另外一件讨厌的事情则是：拉伊卡的情夫——一个公爵看上了里莎，给她写了无聊的信来！终于西尼契金想出了妙计，他设法把信送给拉伊卡，使她去赴公爵的约会，这样由她扮演的角色便不得不由里莎代替。虽然公爵和拉伊卡发现了自己的被骗后愤怒到极点，但是他们的报复并未得逞，里莎的演出终于获得成功，受到观众的称赞。
    影片是以喜剧性的情节收场的，然而这微笑里面却包含着眼泪。它为被埋没了的有才能的人鸣不平，它对黑暗的旧社会提出了控诉！

    北京京剧团两出新戏
    北京京剧团在春节将上演“铡判官”和“珍妃”二个新戏。“铡判官”是根据“探阴山”改编的，剧中突出了封建时代所谓“阴间”的黑暗，否定了善恶有报应的说法，过去某些迷信等不好的表演已被剔除。在“珍妃”一戏中，张君秋创造了很多新的唱腔，满足了一些喜爱京剧歌唱的观众。这二个戏还都采用了简单的景片和灯光，如“铡判官”中小鬼偷看判官窃改生死簿的一场，由于适当的运用了舞台美术，对剧情起了良好的效果。　（匀）
