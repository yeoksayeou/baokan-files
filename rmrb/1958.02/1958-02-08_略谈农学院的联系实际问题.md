A brief discussion on the issue of connecting theory with practice in agricultural colleges
　　Kang Di, Vice President of Northwest Agricultural College

　　The integration of theory with practice is the guiding principle of socialist higher education. It is even more important for agricultural colleges. Due to China's vast territory, abundant resources, and complex natural environment, which changes with time and location, and because agricultural education serves agricultural production, it is necessary to connect with these complex and ever-changing realities to conduct teaching and scientific research, in order to meet the needs of national socialist construction. The close integration of theory and practice is a path that socialist agricultural education adheres to.

　　In the eight years since liberation, under the care and concern of the Party, the vast majority of teachers and students have recognized and accepted this path, and have made many achievements through practical efforts. However, it cannot be ignored that not everyone unconditionally adheres to this path. Due to the deep influence of the capitalist system on education in old China, the style of separating theory from practice has become a habitual force. They do not aim to solve practical problems in production with the arrow of theory, but instead, they come from theory and go to empty talk, detached from reality and production. To completely change this situation, much effort is still needed. Therefore, the struggle between the two lines on this issue is still a long-term and arduous political task for running socialist agricultural universities well.

　　In the past, we paid relatively close attention to the connection between theory and practice. From the beginning of liberation in 1950, we organized teachers and students to participate in large-scale agricultural economic surveys in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces led by the Northwest Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1952, all teachers and students of the Department of Agricultural Economics went to Lutai to engage in production work for more than a year. After that, surveys, internships, and participation in practical production work continued, making it difficult to count them all. We connected theory with practice in roughly the following ways: First, we combined it with various teaching aspects in the teaching process. For example, teaching internships, production internships, etc., in addition to meeting teaching needs, also systematically considered the issue of teachers connecting with practice. For example, the teaching internship for plant protection takes place in Guanzhong in the first year, northern Shaanxi in the second year, and southern Shaanxi in the third year. For students, they can intern in each place and acquire the content they need. For teachers, they can initially understand the insect and plant disease situation in the three different agricultural areas of Shaanxi within three years, and then go to Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. This allows teachers to connect with the realities of various provinces in Northwest China through various teaching aspects. Second, we used holidays or mid-term course adjustments to participate in the inspection work organized by the state and the school, investigating the actual situation of agricultural production. For example, in 1956 and 1957, we participated in the Qinling Expedition Team and the Gansu Hexi Corridor Expedition Team organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Northwest Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine organized surveys of Qin Chuan cattle and Guanzhong donkeys in Shaanxi. The school also organized some surveys, such as the survey on soil and water conservation in northern Shaanxi and the survey on fruit trees in Northwest China. This allows us to enrich the teaching content with local materials. For example, in the past, crop cultivation only talked about crops in Guanzhong, while crops in the spring wheat area of Gansu were completely different, and very little was said about them. After the survey, the textbook on crops in Gansu was expanded. Third, we went to advanced agricultural production areas to summarize the rich production experience of the masses. For example, in the winter of 1954, it was discovered that the corn produced by Wang Baojing of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan, Shaanxi, yielded 1,600 jin per mu. In 1955, five teachers were assigned to summarize Wang Baojing's rich corn production experience using scientific experimental methods, and an associate professor was sent to live in the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative for a long time, placing the experimental fields on the land of the people and conducting scientific research with the farmers, combining science with production and experts with farmers. After a year of effort, the advanced experience of the model worker was summarized and written into scientific papers, further improving the rich production of the model worker. Fourth, we closely contacted the surrounding cooperatives and organized working groups to support the nearby agricultural cooperatives. Because our school is located in the countryside, agricultural cooperatives and farmers are our neighbors, our land is connected to their land, they and we are one family, their cooperative is named "Xinnong Cooperative," and they call our school "our school." We organized teachers from thirteen teaching and research groups to help them with planning, and each teaching and research group assigned a dedicated person to regularly help them implement technical measures. The teachers' Communist Youth League organization ran a technical school for them, cadres helped them establish a library, students helped them with labor, students were sent to the cooperatives for internships, and the school farm helped them with some conditions. Their production increased, and they always said, "If it weren't for the help of the Agricultural College, our cotton production wouldn't be so high." As the production of the masses improved, our teachers and students also gained practical knowledge, and the relationship with the masses was also improved. In addition, grasping the operation of the school farm is an important key to teachers and students connecting with practice. When we took over the mess left by the Kuomintang in 1950, the grass in the farm grew higher than the crops in the people's fields, which the masses called "playing a negative demonstration role," and we were very embarrassed. Later, we quickly reversed this situation, and the yield has been increasing. The large-scale rich harvests of wheat and cotton have often received award flags from the Ministry of Agriculture, Shaanxi Province, and Wugong County. The small two-room office is now full of award flags. With this farm, teachers and students can easily get the opportunity to connect with practice. We carry out scientific research and conduct comprehensive thematic studies. We once organized seven teaching and research groups to cooperate with the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute in conducting cotton rich harvest experiments, which was the highest record for cotton yield per mu in Shaanxi at that time. This promoted the development of production and also solved the problem of teachers connecting with practice. We cooperated with local governments to hold labor model symposiums. We have cooperated with Shaanxi Province and Wugong County to hold labor model symposiums, and we often invite labor models to the school to give reports and meet with teachers and students to learn from the rich production experience of labor models. At the same time, teachers and students can also take this opportunity to connect with practice and solve problems in teaching and research. We hold agricultural technology training classes. We have run agricultural technology training classes for county, prefecture, and provincial cadres, as well as professional training classes for agricultural society accounting and horticulture. Through these training classes, we have not only trained cadres, but also improved the level of teachers and solved the problem of connecting with practice. Participation in promotion and demonstration work can solve the problem of connecting with practice. For example, the promotion of Bima No. 1, the prevention and control of rice bugs with pesticides, and the prevention and control of pea weevils with double-layer packaging are all directly participated in by teachers and students, who have learned a lot of practical knowledge. Organizing teachers and students to visit, participate in various government production activities, various meetings, signing contracts with tractor stations, and helping business departments with design are all good opportunities to connect with practice.

　　By connecting with practice through the above methods, we can improve the level of teachers, increase practical knowledge, and enrich teaching content; at the same time, we can also help production increase yield; and because teachers are combined with practical production and the workers and peasants, we can also help with ideological transformation. In the process of subtle influence over the past few years, the awareness of many teachers has been improved to a certain extent.

　　Since connecting with practice is a struggle between two paths, we must firmly grasp political and ideological work and adhere to the socialist line in order to develop it, make it a trend, and form a habit. Dogmatists often use various reasons to oppose or evade connecting with practice. They prefer to engage in research that is divorced from reality, blindly pursuing international standards to achieve personal academic degrees, hindering the connection between theory and practical production. Second, we must make specific arrangements for connecting with practice, help them create conditions, solve the problems of connecting with practice, and encourage teachers to go into practice. We should introduce and praise their successful experiences and establish banners to promote them in schools. Third, we should list connecting with practice as an important task of the school, specifically arrange it in the school's work plan, send capable cadres to lead it, pay attention to inspection and supervision, regularly care about solving the problems existing in the work, and write the results into papers, report them at scientific discussion meetings, and publish them in the school journal so that everyone recognizes that this is a very good scientific paper and a very good theoretical study. We often propose that the direction of our Northwest Agricultural College is to face production, face reality, and face the countryside, starting from solving practical production problems, and then raising it to the theoretical level to conduct theoretical discussions, not being divorced from reality and pursuing theory for the sake of theory. If we want to cultivate our future historical tradition, this is our future historical tradition. This direction has now been gradually clarified by everyone.

　　In the future, we plan to do the following things:

　　Establish six research and practice points. In 1957, we sent 267 students to the mountains and countryside to work and train, led by 29 teachers, to train in ten points (counties). Among them, we focused on Shang County in southern Shaanxi and Suide in northern Shaanxi. In Guanzhong, we selected two points, one is Liquan, where we sent several teachers and cadres to live and work in the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative for a long time; the other is several cooperatives near Wugong School, where there are also dedicated people living and working in the cooperatives; in addition, there is a vegetable point and a fruit tree point, which are still being selected. These six points are called research and practice points by us, but they are actually farmers' production cooperatives. We go to the cooperatives to conduct research and practice. The tasks of these points are to summarize the production experience of the masses, create rich production models, and help the masses improve production. Starting from the actual situation of the local area and combining with the requirements of production, we put the scientific research of teachers into the fields of agricultural cooperatives. We use agricultural cooperatives as the internship base for students, and help agricultural cooperatives organize students' production internships to solve the difficulty of insufficient land in the school farm. We organize teachers to study in agricultural cooperatives. In the past, study was often conducted in other schools and research institutions for theoretical study. There was almost no study through practical production training. In the future, in addition to the necessary theoretical study, we plan to rotate all teachers who can work and should be trained once within three to five years, for at least one year, as a new way for teachers to study. If we can improve the production of this cooperative and create some experience, it will also greatly help the overall production of the county.

　　We plan to run a training class for veteran cadres. We will train leading cadres above the county level, such as county party secretaries and county magistrates. They have experience in revolutionary struggles, a certain level of Marxism-Leninism, and a lot of experience in leading production. They are very red, but not specialized enough. We plan to reach the equivalent of university level in scientific and technological knowledge in several major professional courses within two years, so that they are both very red and very specialized. Because they are leaders, if their scientific knowledge level is improved, the role they play in production will be greater. At the same time, this is also a very good measure to implement the class line of higher education institutions.

　　We plan to organize several inspection teams. One is the Shangluo Inspection Team, because Shangluo is a low-yield mountainous area in Shaanxi. We don't know much about the situation in this area, and we have done relatively little research. In order to strengthen our connection with reality and at the same time improve the production in this area, it is necessary to conduct an inspection. In addition, we plan to participate in the inspection of the Qinling and Qilian Mountains organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The survey of fruit trees in Northwest China has been completed in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces. This year, we plan to go to Xinjiang and expect to complete the survey of fruit trees in Northwest China.

　　We will improve labor education and teaching internship, combine it with the operation of the farm, or the farm duty system, so that a part of the students can participate in production labor in the farm every afternoon. This will prevent some teaching internships from failing to obtain actual operation opportunities due to the small site, and the farm can often obtain a certain amount of labor to meet production needs, increasing the students' opportunities for practical exercise. In addition, we must strengthen students' various labor exercises in their spare time, and use other teaching methods to strengthen the connection with reality.

　　We also plan to hold labor model symposiums regularly, and invite labor models to the school to report and meet with teachers and students to introduce their rich production experience. We will strengthen cooperation with nearby scientific research institutions, carry out comprehensive research according to the requirements of the national scientific plan, in order to solve the urgent problems that need to be solved in production. We will continue to organize visits, such as visits to typical soil and water conservation areas and visits to rich production areas. This will help us learn from the rich production experience of the masses and enrich the teaching content.

　　Finally, we also plan to strengthen cooperation and connection with all parties, such as Shaanxi Province, Wugong County, tractor stations, agricultural cooperatives, state-owned farms, and scientific research institutions. We need to maintain good connections with all parties in order to solve the problem of connecting with reality from all aspects.

　　略谈农学院的联系实际问题
　　西北农业学院副院长  康迪
    理论联系实际，是社会主义高等教育的方针。对农学院来说，更为重要。由于我国地大物博，自然环境复杂，因时因地的千变万化，农业教育又是为农业生产服务，因此就不能不联系这些复杂而变化多端的实际，来进行教学，开展科学研究工作，以适应国家社会主义建设的需要。使理论与实际紧密结合，这是社会主义农业教育所坚持的一条道路。
    解放八年来，在党的爱护与关怀下，绝大部分的教师和同学，都认识到这条道路，接受了这条道路，并且身体力行做出了不少成绩。但不能忽视的，并不是所有的人都是无条件的坚持这一条道路。由于旧中国的教育受资本主义制度的影响很深，理论与实际脱节的作风，已成了习惯势力。他们不是有的放矢的用理论之矢解决生产上实际之的，而是脱离实际、脱离生产的从理论中来到空谈中去。要想彻底改变这个情况，还要经过许多努力。因此在这个问题上的两条路线的斗争，还是办好社会主义农业大学长期而艰巨的政治任务。
    过去我们对理论与实际的联系，是比较注意的。从解放初1950年起，我们就组织教师学生参加西北农林部领导的规模较大的陕、甘、宁三省的农业经济调查，1952年全体农业经济系的师生去芦台进行生产工作一年多，以后继续进行的调查，实习，以及参加生产实际工作等，一时难以统计。我们进行理论与实际联系，大体有这么几种方式：首先结合教学中各个教学环节，来联系实际。如教学实习、生产实习等，除了根据教学的需要以外，同时有计划地考虑教师的联系实际问题，如植物保护的教学实习，第一年在关中，第二年到陕北，第三年去陕南，对学生来说，每一个地方都能实习到他所需要的内容，对教师来说，三年内可以初步了解，陕西三个不同农业区的昆虫与植物病害的情况，然后再去甘肃、宁夏、青海，这样就可以使得教师通过各个教学环节，联系西北各省的实际。其次利用假期或期中调整课程，参加国家和学校所组织的考察工作，调查农业生产实际情况，如1956、1957两年，参加中国科学院所组织的秦岭考察团、甘肃河西走廊考察团。西北畜牧兽医研究所所组织的陕西秦川牛、关中驴的调查等，学校也组织过一些调查。如陕北水土保持的调查，西北果树调查等。这样可以用本地的资料，充实了教学内容，如过去作物栽培只讲关中的作物，而甘肃春麦区作物和关中完全不同，而讲的很少，经过调查以后，甘肃的作物教材就增加了。第三到先进的农业生产地区，总结群众丰产经验。如1954年冬发现在陕西醴泉烽火农业社王保京的玉米，亩产一千六百斤，1955年就指定了五位教师用科学试验的方法，总结王保京的玉米丰产经验，并派一位副教授长期住在烽火农业社，把试验田放在老百姓的土地上，和农民一道进行科学研究工作，使科学与生产结合，专家与农民结合。经过一年的工夫，总结了劳模的丰产经验，写成科学论文，进一步提高了劳模的丰产。第四密切联系周围的合作社，并组织工作组支援附近的农业社。由于我们的学校就在农村，农业社和农民都是我们的四邻，我们的地和他们的地连成一片，他们和我们是一家人，他们的合作社命名为“西农社”，他们称我们的学校为“咱们的学校”，我们组织了十三个教研组的老师，帮助他们搞规划，每个教研组还指定有专人经常帮助他们贯彻技术措施，教师共青团的组织为他们办了一个技术学校，干部帮助他们建立图书馆，学生帮助他们劳动，派学生到社里去实习，学校农场帮助他们一些条件，他们的产量提高了，人前背后总是这样说：“不是农学院的帮助，我们的棉花产量，那能有这样的高。”群众的生产提高了，我们的教师同学也长了实际知识，群众的关系也搞好了。此外，抓紧办好学校的农场，是师生联系实际的一个重要关键。1950年刚解放时，我们接收国民党的烂摊子，农场地里的草长的比老百姓地里的还高，群众叫“起反示范作用”，我们也很难为情。后来很快地扭转这个局面，产量一直在提高，小麦、棉花的大面积丰产常得到农业部、陕西省、武功县的奖旗，小小两间办公室，已挂满了奖旗。有了这个农场，教师和学生就很方便地得到联系实际的机会。开展科学研究，进行综合性的专题研究。我们曾组织了七个教研组和西北农业科学研究所合作所进行的棉花丰产试验，是当时陕西棉花亩产最高纪录。推动了生产的发展，也解决了教师的联系实际。和地方政府合作举办劳模座谈会。我们曾和陕西省、武功县合作，举办过劳模座谈会，也常请劳模来学校做报告和教师同学见面交谈，向劳模学习丰产经验，同时师生也可借此联系实际，解决教学与研究上的问题。举办农业技术训练班。我们曾经办过县、专、省干部农业技术训练班、农业社会计、园艺等专业训练班，通过这些训练班，既培养了干部，也提高了教师水平，解决联系实际问题。在参加推广示范工作中，可以解决联系实际问题，如在推广碧蚂一号，药剂防治吸浆虫，双席包防治豌豆象等，都是由教师和同学直接参加，学到不少实际知识。组织教师同学参观访问，参加政府各项生产工作、各种会议，和拖拉机站订合同，帮助业务部门设计等都是联系实际的好机会。
    通过以上方式来联系实际，可以提高教师水平，增加实际知识，丰富教学内容；同时也可以帮助生产提高产量；并且由于教师同生产实际和工农群众结合，也可以帮助思想改造。几年来在潜移默化过程中，不少教师的觉悟，有了一定的提高。
    联系实际，既然是两条道路的斗争，就必须抓紧政治思想工作，坚持社会主义路线，才能开展起来，成为风气，养成习惯。教条主义者，常常用种种理由来反对或回避联系实际，他们好搞些脱离实际的研究，盲目地追求国际水平，达到个人获得学位的企图，阻碍了理论与生产实际的联系。其次，对联系实际要做些具体安排，帮助他们创造条件，解决联系实际的问题，鼓励教师到实际中去。对他们的成功经验，应多多介绍表扬，树立旗帜，在学校里推广。再次，把联系实际，列为学校重要工作，具体布置在学校工作计划之中，派得力干部领导，注意于检查督促，经常关心去解决工作中存在的问题，并将结果写成论文，在科学讨论会上报告，学报上发表，使大家认识，这就是很好的科学论文，很好的理论研究。我们经常提出，我们西北农学院的方向是面向生产，面向实际，面向农村，从解决生产实际出发，然后提高到理论水平，进行理论的探讨，不是脱离实际地为理论而理论，如果要培养我们将来的历史传统的话，这就是我们将来的历史传统。这个方向，现已被大家逐渐地明确起来。
    今后，我们打算作这几件事：
    建立六个研究实习点。我们在1957年下放了二百六十七个学生上山下社去劳动锻炼，并由二十九位教师率领，分别到十个点（县）去锻炼，其中我们又以陕南的商县和陕北的绥德为重点，关中我们又选了两个点，一个是醴泉，派了几位教师和干部长期住在烽火农业社工作；另一个是武功学校附近几个社，也有专人住在社里工作；另外还有一个蔬菜的点，一个果树的点，尚在选定当中，这六个点，我们叫它为研究实习点，实际上是农民的生产合作社，我们到社里去研究实习。这些点的任务是总结群众生产经验，创造丰产典型，帮助群众提高生产。从当地的实际情况出发，结合生产上的要求，把教师的科学研究放到农业社的地里去。把农业社作为学生的实习基地，帮助农业社组织学生的生产实习，以解决学校农场土地不足的困难。组织教师到农业社进修，过去的进修常是别的学校和研究机关进行理论的进修，从生产实践的锻炼中去进修，几乎没有，今后除了有必要理论进修还要进行外，准备在三至五年内把可以劳动和应该劳动锻炼的教师，都轮流锻炼一次，时间至少一年，作为教师进修的新途径。如果能把这个社生产搞好，创造出一点经验，对于该县的全面生产，也会有很大的帮助。
    我们准备举办老干部进修班。培养县级以上的领导干部，如县委书记、县长等，他们有革命的斗争经验，有一定的马列主义水平，也有不少领导生产的经验，他们很红，但专得不够，我们准备在两年的时间内，在几门主要专业课的科学技术知识上，达到相当于大学的水平，使他们既很红又很专，因为他们是领导，如果他的科学知识水平提高了，对生产上所起的作用就更大，同时也是贯彻高等学校阶级路线的很好的措施。
    准备组织几个考察团，一个是商雒考察团，因为商雒是陕西低产山区，我们对这个地区的情况了解得不很多，研究得也比较少，为了加强我们和实际联系，同时把这个地区的生产搞好，考察一下，很有必要。另外秦岭和祁连山的考察是中国科学院组织的，我们准备参加。西北果树的调查已完成陕、甘、青三省，今年准备去新疆，预计将完成西北果树的调查工作。
    改进劳动教育和教学实习工作，结合农场操作的实习，或农场值班制度，使每天下午都有一部分学生到农场去参加生产劳动工作，这样可使一部分教学实习，不致因场地小而得不到实际操作的机会，而农场又可经常得到一定数量的劳动力以满足生产的需要，增加了学生实际锻炼的机会。另外还要加强学生课余的各种劳动锻炼。以及利用其它的教学方式，加强与实际联系。
    我们还准备定期举办劳模座谈会，有计划的请劳模到学校来报告，和教师学生见面，介绍他们的丰产经验。加强和附近的科学研究机关协作，按国家科学规划的要求，开展综合性的研究，以解决生产上迫切需要解决的问题。继续组织参观访问，如水土保持典型的参观以及各地丰产典型的访问。借以学习群众丰产经验，充实教学内容。
    最后，我们还准备加强与各方面的合作和联系，如陕西省、武功县，拖拉机站、农业社、国营农场、以及科学研究机关等，都需要很好的联系，从各方面来解决联系实际的问题。
