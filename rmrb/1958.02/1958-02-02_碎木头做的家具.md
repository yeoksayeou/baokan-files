　　Furniture Made of Scrap Wood
    Not long ago, the Beijing Timber Factory trial-produced a type of furniture made from scrap materials, including a double bed, a small wardrobe, a square table, a small desk, a square stool, and chairs. They are exquisite, beautiful, and of good quality. The table tops and stool tops are pieced together with wooden strips in patterns, which are both attractive and not easily warped. This type of furniture is very cheap. A double bed sells for just over 39 yuan, more than 10 yuan cheaper than a typical double bed on the market; a square stool sells for only 2 yuan, even cheaper than a small chair for children.
    This furniture should be available in the capital's markets around the time of the Spring Festival. (Sun Guang) (Attached picture)

　　碎木头做的家具
    北京市木材厂不久以前试制出来一种用碎料做的双人床、小衣柜、方桌、小书桌、方凳和椅子，精巧、美观，质量也很好。桌面和凳面用木条拼成花纹，又好看，又不容易跷起来。这种家具价格很便宜，一张双人床只卖三十九元多，比市场上一般的双人床便宜十多元；一张方凳只卖两元，比儿童坐的小椅子还贱。
    大约在春节前后，首都的市场上就可以买到这种家具了。　（孙光）（附图片）
