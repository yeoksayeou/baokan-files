	Street Corners
	Giving Gifts
	Our leading comrades, at a meeting, called on us to "visit relatives" and "give gifts" to the farmers. We all laughed when we heard this. How could they call for "giving gifts"? Later, we learned that these gifts were actually sending manure to the farmers to support agricultural production. As a result, everyone's enthusiasm soared. The employees of our Baoji Xinqin Company alone sent more than 50,000 catties of fertilizer to the countryside in just over two days.

	We all happily said: We workers have also contributed a little to agricultural production. Shouldn't all workers learn from us and do the same? But our leaders told us that we were still learning from other places. The youths of the Communist Youth League branch of the Suide County Handicraft Production Cooperative in Shaanxi Province accumulated more than 218,000 catties of fertilizer for the farmers in twelve days.

	Washing Clothes
	A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army came to a village in the western suburbs of Shanghai. After settling down, the soldiers were going to wash their clothes. After soaking the clothes, they carried them in basins, preparing to go outside to wash. Just as they walked out of the gate, they met two female comrades who had recently been transferred to Xinmin First Cooperative. They greeted them with smiles and said, "You got up in the middle of the night and walked all this way. You haven't rested yet. Let us wash your clothes for you." The soldiers refused to let them. They had come to the suburbs to help the farmers build water conservancy projects and eliminate snails. How could they ask the masses to wash their clothes? Seeing that they couldn't persuade the comrades, the two transferred cadres pretended to be unhappy and said, "Do you think we won't wash them clean?" At this, the comrades had no choice but to say, "Then we'll talk about it later." After saying that, they put down their clothes and went back inside. When they came out a while later, the clothes and basins were gone. After searching around the camp area, they returned to the gate and saw that the washed clothes were all hung out to dry on bamboo poles. (A certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison, Xiang Yang)
	A Box of "Lotus Root Flour"
	I am an overseas Chinese who returned from Malaya in March of the year before last. On January 22nd, I bought a package of Guangzhou specialty - Bantang "Lotus Root Flour", planning to ask a friend going to Beijing to take it to my wife. I had agreed with my friend beforehand to deliver it to him at the railway station. However, when I rushed to the Guangzhou Railway Station, the train was about to depart. In a hurry, a railway broadcaster took the package of "Lotus Root Flour" and enthusiastically told me that after the train departed, he would find a way to give it to my friend. When I returned from the station, I found that my friend had been delayed and hadn't left for Beijing. My package of "Lotus Root Flour" went north on the train alone. At the time, I thought that although the name and address of the recipient were written on the "Lotus Root Flour", I had not completed any consignment procedures, and my wife would definitely not receive the "Lotus Root Flour". Unexpectedly, on February 1st, I received a letter from my wife saying that the "Lotus Root Flour" had been delivered by the staff of the station.

    街头巷尾
    送礼
    我们的领导同志，在一次会议上号召我们同农民“走亲戚”、“送礼”。我们一听都笑了，怎么号召起“送礼”来了，后来才知道这送礼是送粪给农民，支援农业生产。这一来大家劲头可大了，只我们宝鸡新秦公司的职工，两天多就给农村送了肥料五万多斤。
    我们都高兴地说：在农业生产上咱们工人也尽了一点力，应该让所有的工人们都学习我们这样做吧；谁知领导上告诉我们说，我们还是向别的地方学习的。人家陕西省绥德县手工业生产联合社共青团支部的青年们，十二天的时间就为农民积了二十一万八千多斤肥。

    洗衣服
    解放军某部来到了上海西郊区的一个乡里。宿营以后，战士们要去洗衣服。衣服泡好后，用脸盆端着准备到外边去洗。刚走出大门口，就遇上了两位下放到新民一社不久的女同志，她们笑容满面地迎上来说：“你们是半夜起床来的，走累了，还没休息，衣服叫我们洗去好啦。”战士们说啥都不肯让。因为他们是到郊区来帮助农民兄弟兴修水利、消灭钉螺的呀，怎好叫群众帮助洗衣服呢？这两个下放干部看没方法说服同志们，便假装不高兴地说：“是你们嫌洗的不干净吗？”这一来，同志们只好说：“那么等一会再说吧”。说完把衣服放下就向屋里去了。一会出来，衣服和脸盆都不见了。当他们在驻地附近找了几个圈子，回到门口时，只见洗好的衣服已统统晒在竹竿上了。　（上海驻军某部　向阳）
    一盒“莲藕粉”
    我是前年3月从马来亚归国的华侨。1月22日，我买了一包广州特产——半塘“莲藕粉”，准备请一个去北京的朋友带给我的爱人。事前我和朋友约好，送到火车站去交给他。但是，当我跑到广州火车站的时候，列车快要开行了，在匆忙间一位列车广播员把那包“莲藕粉”接过去，热情地告诉我，等列车开行以后，他将替我设法把它交给我的朋友。当我从车站回来后，却发觉我的朋友因事耽搁了没有动身去北京。我的那包“莲藕粉”独自跟火车北上了。当时我想，“莲藕粉”上虽写有收物人的姓名和地址，但我没有办理任何托运手续，我的爱人一定不会收到“莲藕粉”的了。不料2月1日，我接到爱人的来信说：“莲藕粉”已经由车站的工作人员送到了。（广东东莞新洲邮政代办所　严守驹）
