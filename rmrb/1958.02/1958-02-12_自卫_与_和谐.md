　　The French aircraft's outrageous bombing of peaceful residents of Tunisia has aroused worldwide outrage. However, French Defense Minister Chaban-Delmas shamelessly argued that France was taking "legitimate self-defense" actions.

　　France sent a large number of bombers into the territory of another country to carry out barbaric bombings of civilians, and it can actually be described as "legitimate self-defense." This is the logic and language of aggressors through and through.

　　Even more shameless is that the French government hypocritically spread the word that it is "still working to develop a harmonious and lasting good relationship between France and Tunisia."

　　Tens of thousands of French colonial troops stationed in Tunisia stubbornly refuse to withdraw. The French invading army has launched fifty attacks on the Tunisian border in recent months. Now twenty-five French aircraft have carried out a full hour of frenzied bombing of peaceful Tunisian villages. What kind of "harmonious" relationship is this?

　　President Sukarno is right: "Colonizers and oppressed countries cannot coexist peacefully." There is no "harmony" between occupiers and the occupied, aggressors and the aggressed, murderers and victims!

　　If the French authorities think that these sweet words can deceive anyone, or ease the indignation of the Tunisian people and the righteous people of all countries, then they are committing another error after committing a crime.

### “自卫”与“和谐”

    “自卫”与“和谐”
    法机狂炸突尼斯和平居民的暴行已引起了全世界的震怒，但是，法国国防部长沙邦—戴尔马竟强词夺理说，法国采取的是“正当的自卫”行动。
    法国派了大批轰炸机到别人的国境内对平民进行野蛮的轰炸，居然能说成是“正当的自卫”行动。这是彻头彻尾的侵略者的逻辑和语言。
    更加无耻的是，法国政府还假惺惺地散布说什么它“仍在努力发展法突之间的和谐而持久的良好关系。”
    驻在突尼斯的几万名法国殖民军队死不肯撤走，法国侵略军几个月来对突尼斯边境发动了五十次攻击，现在二十五架法国飞机又对突尼斯和平村庄进行了一小时之久的狂轰滥炸，这算是什么样的“和谐”关系呢？
    苏加诺总统说得对：“殖民者和被压迫国家是不能和平共处的。”占领者和被占领者之间，侵略者和被侵略者之间，凶手和受害者之间是没有什么“和谐”可言的！
    如果法国当局认为他们的这些花言巧语能够骗得了什么人，能够缓和突尼斯人民和各国正义人民的愤慨，那末它就是在犯了罪行之后，又犯了错误。
