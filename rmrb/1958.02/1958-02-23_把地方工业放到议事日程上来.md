Put Local Industry on the Agenda
Jing Yu

    Under the situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production, agriculture has more and more demands on industry, especially local industry: large-scale water conservancy projects require a large number of water conservancy materials, increasing crop yields per unit area requires a large amount of chemical fertilizers, reforming agricultural technology requires a large number of new agricultural implements, and saving labor also requires a large number of new and simple transportation tools. In addition, a large number of agricultural products need to be processed by local industries; in the future, after a large number of agricultural tools are sent to the countryside, repair shops will also be needed to help with repairs.

    What is the situation of local industry? Although there has been great development in the past few years, it is still far from meeting the needs of agriculture. This situation urgently requires local industry to make a great leap forward rapidly. It requires the leading force of the local Party committees to not only grasp agriculture, but also grasp industry at the same time; if they only grasp agriculture and not industry at the same time, agriculture cannot continue to make a great leap forward.

    How to run local industry? This newspaper introduced the experience of Qin County, Shanxi on January 13; today, this newspaper also published the news of the ten-year industrial plan of Jiyuan County, Henan. The CPC Jiyuan County summarized the basic experience of developing local industry during the first five-year plan, clarified the policy of local industry focusing on supporting agricultural production, and found specific ways to overcome difficulties. Is there a lack of materials? Their method is to rely on the mountains to eat the mountains, industry to go up the mountains, mobilize the masses to report mines, explore underground resources, focus on their own raw materials, and process and manufacture locally. Is there a lack of funds? Their method is to rely on the development of production by handicrafts, accumulate funds, focus on small scale, be simple and crude, make full use of farm labor, and try every means to spend less money, do more things, invest less, and get quick results. Is there a lack of technology? They rely on existing technical forces to teach and learn, and conduct short-term training. Is it difficult to sell? They focus on comprehensive enterprises, with flexible and diverse products, sell locally, and maintain continuous production. These indigenous experiences point out a bright road for the development of local industry.

    Vigorously developing local industry is of great significance for striving to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in major industrial products in about fifteen years, because if local industry develops, most of the things needed by urban and rural people's lives and agricultural production will be undertaken by local industry, and the state can concentrate its efforts on running heavy industry. Then, the time to catch up with the United Kingdom can also be greatly shortened.

    It is hoped that all counties will formulate industrial development plans, put local industry on the agenda, and make local industry make a great leap forward.

### 把地方工业放到议事日程上来

    把地方工业放到议事日程上来
    静宇
    在农业生产大跃进的形势下，农业对工业、特别是对地方工业的要求越来越多了：大规模的水利工程需要大量的水利器材，提高农田单位面积产量需要大量的化学肥料，改革农业技术需要大量的新式农具，为了节省劳动力还需要大量的新式的简便的运输工具。还有，大量的农产品需要地方工业加工；将来大量的农具下乡以后，还需要修理厂帮助修理。
    地方工业的情况如何呢？几年来虽有很大发展，但是目前仍然远远不能满足农业的需要。这个形势，迫切要求地方工业迅速地来个大跃进。要求地方党委的领导力量不仅要抓农业，同时，也要抓工业；只抓农业而不同时抓工业，农业就不可能继续大跃进。
    怎样办地方工业？本报在1月13日曾经介绍了山西沁县的经验；今天，本报又刊登了河南济源县工业十年规划的消息。中共济源县总结了第一个五年计划期间发展地方工业的基本经验，明确了地方工业以支援农业生产为主的方针，找到了克服困难的具体道路。缺乏材料吗？他们的办法是靠山吃山、工业上山、发动群众报矿，挖掘地下资源，以自有原料为主，就地取材，就地加工和制造。缺乏资金吗？他们的办法是依靠手工业发展生产，积累资金，以小型为主，因陋就简，充分利用农间劳动力，想尽一切办法，作到少花钱，多办事，投资少，收效快。缺乏技术吗？他们依靠现有技术力量，包教保学，短期训练。销路困难吗？他们以综合性企业为主，产品灵活多样，就地销售，保持连续生产。这些土生土长的经验，为发展地方工业指出了光明大道。
    大力发展地方工业对于争取在十五年左右在主要工业产品方面赶上或者超过英国有着重要意义，因为地方工业发展了，城乡人民生活和农业生产所需要的东西大部分由地方工业承担了，国家就可以集中力量办重工业。那末，赶上英国的时间也就可以大大缩短了。
    希望各县都制定工业发展规划，把地方工业放到议事日程上来，使地方工业来个大跃进。
