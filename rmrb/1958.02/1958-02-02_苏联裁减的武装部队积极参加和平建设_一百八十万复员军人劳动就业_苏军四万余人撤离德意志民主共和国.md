Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from Moscow: According to TASS, Baibakov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation of the Soviet Union, published an article in "Red Star" yesterday stating that the 1.8 million Soviet officers and soldiers demobilized by the Soviet Union during 1955-1956 have all found work. The 300,000 Soviet troops demobilized according to the recent decision by the Soviet government to further reduce the armed forces will also find employment in the places where they originally resided.

Baibakov said that the employment problem of these 300,000 Soviet officers and soldiers being demobilized this time could be resolved in the shortest possible time. All local Soviets in the Soviet Union have established special committees to arrange this matter. If demobilized soldiers wish to be employed in enterprises and construction sites far from their original places of residence, the relevant agencies will be responsible for handling their matters and will also provide necessary material assistance and preferential treatment during their relocation.

Baibakov pointed out that due to large-scale construction, various sectors of the Soviet national economy can accommodate many workers, especially in regions such as the Urals, Siberia, Tatarstan, and the southern part of the Russian Federation. This year alone, the agricultural sector needs to train 173,000 tractor drivers and combine harvester operators. Demobilized soldiers have every opportunity to acquire new professions. In addition, demobilized soldiers can also enjoy preferential treatment if they want to enter universities or start families.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from Berlin: According to the German News Agency, on January 31, Army General Zakharov, Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, visited Willi Stopph, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic and Walter Ulbricht, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. During the visit, Zakharov told Willi Stoph and Ulbricht that, according to the resolution passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on December 21, 1957, more than 41,000 Soviet troops have now withdrawn from the German Democratic Republic.

　　苏联裁减的武装部队积极参加和平建设
    一百八十万复员军人劳动就业
    苏军四万余人撤离德意志民主共和国
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联俄罗斯联邦部长会议第一副主席巴伊巴科夫昨天在“红星报”发表文章说，1955年—1956年期间苏联裁减的一百八十万苏军官兵都获得了工作。根据苏联政府最近再次裁减武装部队的决定而复员的三十万苏军军人也将在他们原来居住的地方劳动就业。
    巴伊巴科夫说，这次裁减的三十万苏军官兵的劳动就业问题在最短期间就可以获得解决。苏联所有的地方苏维埃都成立了专门委员会来安排这个问题。如果复员军人希望在距他们原来居住的地方很远的企业和建筑工地就业，有关机构将会负责处理他的问题，而且在他迁移时还给以必要的物质帮助和优待。
    巴伊巴科夫指出，由于进行大规模建设，苏联国民经济各部门能够容纳许多工人。特别是在乌拉尔、西伯利亚、鞑靼、俄罗斯联邦南部等地区。今年，单是农业方面就需要培养十七万三千名拖拉机手和收获联合机手。复员军人有一切可能获得新的职业。此外，复员军人如果想进高等学校或成家立业，也可以享受到优待。
    新华社1日讯　据德意志通讯社柏林讯：1月31日驻德苏军兵团司令扎哈罗夫陆军大将拜会了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希。扎哈罗夫大将在拜会中对格罗提渥和乌布利希说，根据苏联最高苏维埃在1957年12月21日通过的决议，现在已经有四万一千多名苏军撤离德意志民主共和国。
