Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government delegation he led visited the heroic city of Wonsan on the afternoon of the 16th, which made outstanding contributions in the war against the American aggressors. They joined the enthusiastic citizens of Wonsan at the Wonsan Railway Station in dancing Korean folk dances, celebrating the profound friendship forged in blood between the peoples of the two countries.

As they danced joyfully, Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nam Il, and the welcoming crowds applauded and cheered.

Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage arrived in this heroic city on the east coast of Korea at 2:40 p.m. on the 16th. Tens of thousands of citizens welcomed the Chinese guests at the station and on the roads in the city center. Chinese and Korean national flags fluttered, colored flowers flew, and the sounds of gongs and bugles resounded through the sky. Children presented the guests with large bouquets of flowers, and local party and government leaders came to welcome the guests.

Wonsan, rebuilt from scorched earth, was beautifully dressed today. National flags of the two countries were hung throughout the city, and huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Kim Il-sung were hung side by side on many tall buildings. Welcome slogans were everywhere, and welcome billboards for the Chinese guests were also erected along the roads winding around the mountains.

After Premier Zhou Enlai and others got off the train, they took a car to the station of the Korean People's Army, where they had a cordial meeting with the glorious soldiers of the People's Army.

When Premier Zhou and his party returned to the station from the People's Army station, it was already evening. More people gathered here to welcome the Chinese guests. From the platform to the road far from the station was a dense sea of people, constantly waving flags and cheering. In front of the welcoming crowd, dozens of young women in pink dresses were singing and dancing happily, and they danced more and more happily. This sincere friendship of the citizens towards the Chinese people deeply moved the Chinese guests. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, and General Su Yu initially stood with Premier Kim Il-sung and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nam Il, clapping gently to the rhythm of the dance. Later, Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen, Vice Minister Zhang, General Su Yu, and members of the delegation couldn't help but join the circle of friendship, singing and dancing with the citizens. At this time, the emotion of friendship reached its peak at the station in this city by the sea and leaning against the mountains. People raised the bouquets of flowers and flags in their hands even higher, and the cheers of "Long live" were even louder.

Premier Zhou Enlai stepped out of the dance circle, preparing to board the train with Premier Kim Il-sung to bid farewell to this heroic city. At this time, the welcoming crowd rushed forward, and Premier Zhou and Premier Kim were immediately surrounded by the enthusiastic crowd. The premiers and prime ministers of the two brotherly countries smiled and waved to the people in response.

Subsequently, the Chinese guests, carrying the sincere friendship of the people of the heroic city, boarded the train and set off for the station of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    周总理访问英雄城市元山
    新华社平壤16日电　周恩来总理和他率领的中国政府代表团16日下午访问了在抗击美国侵略者的战争中作了卓越贡献的英雄城市元山。他们在元山车站同热情的元山市民们一起跳了朝鲜的民间舞，共庆两国人民用鲜血凝成的深厚友谊。
    当他们欢乐起舞的时候，金日成首相、南日副首相兼外务相和欢迎的群众一起鼓掌欢呼。
    周恩来总理一行在16日下午二时四十分到达了这个朝鲜东海岸的英雄城市。在车站上和市中心的道路上有上万名市民欢迎中国客人。朝中两国国旗飘扬，彩花飞舞，铜鼓洋号齐鸣，欢呼声响彻云霄。儿童们把大束大束的鲜花献给客人，当地的党政负责人都来欢迎客人。
    从焦土上重新建立起来的元山，今天打扮得十分美丽。全城都挂着两国国旗，许多高大的建筑物并排挂着毛泽东主席和金日成首相的巨像。到处都是欢迎标语，盘绕山峰的公路两旁也插起了欢迎中国客人的标语牌。
    周恩来总理等下火车以后，就乘车到朝鲜人民军驻地，同光荣的人民军战士亲切地会见。
    周总理一行从人民军驻地返回车站的时候，已经傍晚。更多的人向这里聚拢来欢迎中国客人。从月台到车站远处的马路上是一片密密层层的人海，他们一直不停地摇旗欢呼。在欢迎群众的前面，有几十名穿着粉红色衣裙的女青年，在兴高彩烈地载歌载舞，她们越跳越高兴。市民们这种发自内心深处的对中国人民的友谊，深深感动了中国客人。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长、张闻天副部长和粟裕大将起初同金日成首相、南日副首相兼外务相站在一起和着舞蹈的节奏轻轻地鼓掌，后来，周总理、陈副总理、张副部长、粟裕大将和代表团的随行人员都情不自禁地卷入了友谊的舞圈，和市民们一起欢乐歌舞。这时，在这个傍海依山的城市的车站上，友谊的情感达到了最高峰。人们把手中的花束和旗帜举得更高，“万岁”的欢呼声也更加响亮。
    周恩来总理走出舞圈，准备同金日成首相一起走上火车，向这个英雄城市告别，这个时候，欢迎群众一拥而上，周总理和金首相马上被热情的人群包围起来，两个兄弟国家的总理和首相含笑向人们频频挥手答礼。
    随后，中国客人带着英雄城市人民的真诚友谊乘上火车向中国人民志愿军总部的驻地进发。
