I completely agree with the various reports of the conference. The report on the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme reminded me of the arduous journey of learning national culture in the past, enhanced my understanding of the bright future of promoting national culture, and thus encouraged me to speak on the issue of national culture today.

The formulation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will inevitably accelerate the high tide of our cultural construction, along with the high tide of economic construction.

In the past, patriotic people who cared about writing and language issues once requested the Ministry of Education of the Qing Dynasty in 1902 to put forward the slogan of "National Language Unification," and once requested the Beiyang Government in 1912 to put forward the slogan of "Pronunciation Unification." Many philologists, phonologists, and linguists have offered their research insights into trial-made alphabets, and have also formulated phonetic alphabets and national language Romanization. Their long-term and joint demands were not only to provide the broad masses of people with an easy-to-learn tool for Chinese characters, but also to provide the broad masses of people with a common language direction. The reactionary government, which was never willing to care about the cultural life of the people, could not possibly lead experts, pool wisdom, and formulate plans to meet the needs of the people to learn culture; the people who had long been living in dire straits could not possibly have the conditions to realize their cultural learning requirements. Sixty years have passed, and the demands of the past sixty years have finally been realized in today's People's Government. The formulation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and the enthusiastic situation in which the broad masses of working people are now actively learning the Chinese phonetic alphabet, cannot but make people fully realize the great role of political factors, and cannot but make people fully realize the role of culture that the working people urgently need in their new social life. These roles will inevitably accelerate the high tide of our cultural construction, along with the high tide of economic construction. There is no doubt that the formulation and promulgation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a great happy event in the cultural life of the Chinese people, and we should warmly express our celebration and welcome.

Chinese characters have unique advantages, but they are not without shortcomings. Its main shortcoming is that there is no direct connection between the shape and sound of the characters.

As everyone knows, the shape of Chinese characters can fully express the meaning of the characters. Despite language barriers, as long as they recognize Chinese characters, they can express their meaning and feelings to each other. This is the unique advantage of Chinese characters. Chinese characters can still shoulder the task of preserving the continuously developing historical culture of our country for thousands of years, which cannot but make us deeply grateful for the contributions of Chinese characters. As everyone knows, Chinese characters are not without shortcomings. The main shortcoming of Chinese characters is that there is no direct connection between the shape and sound of the characters. Although people often say, "More than 90% of Chinese characters are composed of two parts: 'representing sound' and 'representing meaning'. As long as you recognize the 'representing sound' part, you may know the pronunciation." However, the facts that all Chinese characters tell us in terms of phonetics are not that simple at all. According to my research on the phonetic aspects of Chinese characters more than thirty years ago, and teaching for several years; the smattering of knowledge about pronunciation that I gained from research and teaching in the past has now been almost forgotten. What still leaves a deep impression on me and has not been completely forgotten is just the three troublesome problems of Chinese characters in terms of phonetics: (1) Too many phonetic characters: As the phonetic part, it is not a fixed number of symbols, but originally they were all Chinese characters, and the number is frighteningly large, including the small number of isolated sound characters that have never had a phonetic function and have no homophones, such as "恩" (ēn), "怎" (zěn), "岑" (cén), "森" (sēn), "僧" (sēng), "印" (yìn), "丢" (diū), etc., less than twenty characters in total, there are a total of one thousand two hundred and sixteen Chinese characters. Among such a large number of phonetic characters, there are also many extremely uncommon and obscure characters. Learning these obscure characters is a waste of effort. For example, "读" (dú), "续" (xù), "赎" (shú), "牍" (dú), "渎" (dú), "诀" (jué), "缺" (quē), "决" (jué), "抉" (jué), "玦" (jué), the right-hand radicals of these characters, everyone knows that they are phonetic parts, but the character "卖" (mài) as the phonetic part was not originally in this shape. It was simplified by a few strokes in the Han Dynasty before it resembled the character "卖" (mài) of "买卖" (buying and selling), but after all, it is not allowed to be recognized as the character "卖" (mài) of "买卖" (buying and selling); the character "夬" (guài) as the phonetic part is not the character "央" (yāng) of "中央" (center) with one less stroke. What is the pronunciation of these two characters "卖" (mài), "夬" (guài), what is their explanation, what is their use, I am afraid that even if you ask a writer who can write articles and compose poetry, they may not be able to answer with certainty. (2) The phonetic position is not fixed: Do not believe in the so-called "upper shape lower sound, left shape right sound" statement of some people about the pronunciation of Chinese characters and be misled, thinking that there are only two phonetic positions of Chinese characters: not below but on the right; this is a big mistake. For example, the phonetics of the characters "叩" (kòu), "致" (zhì), "墙" (qiáng), "和" (hé), "锦" (jǐn), "顾" (gù), "判" (pàn), "郊" (jiāo), "豫" (yù), "鸠" (jiū) are all on the left and not "left shape right sound"; the phonetics of the characters "币" (bì), "掌" (zhǎng), "应" (yīng), "怠" (dài), "奕" (yì), "譬" (pì), "辈" (bèi), "愁" (chóu), "禽" (qín), "婆" (pó) are all on the top and not "upper shape lower sound." There are also many Chinese characters whose shapes, as a result of long-term and repeated evolution, can no longer be divided into upper, lower, left, and right positions, and it is even impossible to find the phonetic part in which side. For example, "布" (bù) sounds from "父" (fù), "年" (nián) sounds from "千" (qiān), "成" (chéng) sounds from "丁" (dīng), "寺" (sì) sounds from "之" (zhī), "良" (liáng) sounds from "亡" (wáng), etc. If you have not studied philology, it is impossible to know that these characters originally contained phonetic components. (3) The phonetic does not match reality: It is very natural that Chinese characters, which do not rely on a small number of letters to represent the pronunciation of the characters, have different changes in pronunciation due to different times and regions. For example, the characters "问" (wèn), "闻" (wén), "闷" (mèn), "闽" (mǐn), etc., which used to sound from "门" (mén), do not read "门" (mén) now, and the characters "很" (hěn), "限" (xiàn), "银" (yín), "眼" (yǎn), etc., which used to sound from "艮" (gěn), do not read "艮" (gěn) now. Throughout the dynasties, the phonology, exegesis, and philology related to pronunciation often have to make different changes in the method and content of phonetic notation due to the different times and regions.

As a result of the different changes in the shape and sound of characters due to different times and regions, the arrangement and checking of the shape of characters has different "540 radicals," "220 radicals," "214 radicals," "rhyme division," "sound division," "stroke number," "number," etc.; the sound of characters has different "read as," "read the same," "read from," "direct sound," "fanqie," "282 rhymes," "206 rhymes," "106 rhymes," "80 rhymes," "76 rhymes," "19 parts," "18 parts," "17 parts," "16 parts," "13 che," "12 she," etc. in sound checking and phonetic notation, and at the same time there are different changes such as "grade call," "tone," "yin and yang," "clear and turbid," "jian and tuan." There are many works on the shape and sound of characters throughout the dynasties. According to the records of these many books, we know the changes and rules of the shape and sound of characters due to time and place, so that we recognize that the pronunciation and voice that have rules of change are the most suitable for using letters to phonetic notation and compile indexes. Therefore, it proves the reasons for the difficulties encountered in phonetic checking and phonetic notation in the past, and proves the reasons for the differences in pronunciation and voice in the past, all of which are due to the inevitable result of not using letters.

Chinese characters with unique advantages and Beijing dialect with unique advantages use the twenty-six letters in the scheme to ensure the correctness of pronunciation and voice without change and divergence, and ensure easy learning of culture, which will inevitably make Chinese characters and Chinese language play a greater role.

The current Beijing dialect is often praised as being as beautiful and pleasant to hear as music, but if we do not use letters to fix the pronunciation of Beijing dialect now, after a certain period of changes, it may become more difficult to understand than the dialects of Fujian and Guangdong in the future. In most of the national Chinese language area, each character's sound and voice are divided into five tones; some areas are divided into six tones, seven tones, and eight tones, etc. Only Beijing dialect is divided into four tones, so the number of basic sounds in Beijing dialect is the least, and it is easier to learn. Beijing dialect has the least number of voiced consonants in the national Chinese language area, so it sounds crisp. These are the unique advantages of Beijing dialect. There are only one thousand four hundred and twenty-eight basic sounds in Beijing dialect, and if the four tones are not distinguished, there are only four hundred and eleven basic sounds. These four hundred and eleven basic sounds are all composed of twenty-one initials and thirty-five finals. These twenty-one initials and thirty-five finals are all composed of a small number of phonemes. The twenty-six letters in the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can fully indicate the correct pronunciation of these phonemes. As long as you can master the correct use of these twenty-six letters, you can read out all the Chinese characters and the sound of Beijing dialect according to the letters. This method of phonetic notation of "controlling complexity with simplicity" is precisely the crystallization of the research of Chinese scholars of all dynasties and the habits of people from all over the world on the phonetic notation of Chinese characters.

Chinese characters with unique advantages and Beijing dialect with unique advantages will henceforth use these twenty-six letters to ensure the correctness of pronunciation and voice without change and divergence, and ensure the ease of learning culture, which will inevitably make Chinese characters and Chinese language play a greater role. This is certain. Such a revolutionary measure with historical significance, such a method of promoting national culture by transplanting flowers and trees on the original foundation of national culture, will henceforth make the national culture like a towering ancient tree rising from the ground, suddenly sprouting new buds; this is as wise as the measures of the Party Central Committee and the People's Government towards the heritage of national medicine.

Latin letters have long become a cultural tool for the daily application of people in various countries around the world, and the people of our country will not feel unfamiliar and difficult to learn.

Latin letters, which have been developed for a long time and have a huge effect on culture, have long become a cultural tool for the daily application of people from all over the world. Although it is not something inherent in our country, it has now become our country's own alphabet, so learning it will not feel unfamiliar and difficult. Also, because learning how to use a tool will never be as difficult as researching academics. The origin and development of Western medicine, as well as the many valuable achievements in pathology, diagnosis and treatment, are completely different from the theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine. Only traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with a certain scientific knowledge base can understand the preciousness of its achievements. Learning the knowledge of Western medicine is certainly not as easy as learning the phonetic alphabet. Carefully examining and researching a single hair and forgetting that the other end of the hair is connected to a living person, although it is not that there are absolutely no occasional similar situations in Western medicine, but traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who only look at the forest and ignore the branches and leaves may not be able to correctly grasp the overall picture of pathology. It is rare to have clear-sighted doctors who grasp the pathological relationship between overall holistic changes and local subtle changes and carry out effective medical measures. In order to make their business good and earn more money, they often do some publicity work and cannot concentrate on studying medicine. Such famous doctors are not too few in capitalist society. The meanings of the two nouns "clear-sighted doctor" and "famous doctor" are fundamentally different, but they sound exactly the same when spoken and heard, which also incidentally illustrates the role of Chinese characters, which is still very large today. People who study traditional Chinese medicine all their lives may not become clear-sighted doctors; after a long period of delving into Western medicine, the people who become clear-sighted doctors are still a minority after all. This is not to say that medicine is more profound than any other science, but it is indeed that today's medicine, whether Western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine, is still a relatively weak science among all modern sciences, and there are still many questions whose answers are blank or difficult; waiting for all scholars related to medicine to unite, integrate the strengths of all, and jointly study this academic of curing diseases and prolonging life, and continue to enrich and improve it. The Party and the government pointed out the direction of the convergence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and first called on Western medicine to learn from traditional Chinese medicine. This is precisely for the purpose of improving the health care academic and developing the health care cause for the people, which is not to say that traditional Chinese medicine is superior to Western medicine, nor is it to say that as long as Western medicine learns a prescription or a technique from traditional Chinese medicine, it is considered to have achieved the convergence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, nor is it to say that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who have the conditions to learn Western medicine can no longer learn Western medicine.

Whether it is Western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine, they are all sciences that accumulate the practical experience of the masses and then systematize it and serve the masses, and these two medicines continue to develop forward according to their original systems in different forms and at different speeds. The convergence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine is an inevitable trend in the development of medical science, but it does not mean that the development of medicine will be permanently terminated after the convergence is realized in the future. The academic of "controlling complexity with simplicity" adopted in dealing with all things that develop "from simplicity to complexity" is still a process in the development of academics. Any kind of academic that is constantly developing forward cannot remain unchanged, cannot meet the requirements of application 100%, and cannot avoid difficulties and achieve academic success by fluke without systematic study. On the basis of the original system, gradually transforming and improving, making up for shortcomings, and solving difficulties is the law of development of all academics, is the direction of continued development of the heritage of national medicine in the future, and is the source of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. It is necessary to fully understand all the contents of a certain academic before it is possible to discover the right and wrong, and it is possible to transform, improve, and accept a certain academic, so systematic learning should be regarded as a necessary process for all measures in academic. For example, some people see the letters in the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and think that they are similar to the letters of English, French or Russian that they already know, and are unwilling to seriously learn according to a certain system. As a result, they will not be able to master how to use these letters to spell Chinese characters and correct dialects. Any kind of academic one-sided and fragmentary knowledge gained from detaching from the system cannot be mastered and used, and may even lead oneself to make mistakes. Just as someone buys a book on dialectical materialism and is unwilling to study it systematically from beginning to end, and only casually flips through a small section of the materialistic part or a small section of the dialectical part and thinks that they understand philosophy, the result of the development of their thoughts from this is very likely to tend to Feuerbach or Hegel. Therefore, for people who do not know Chinese characters, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme must be studied seriously and systematically. Even for people who have learned Chinese characters but do not understand Mandarin, and people who can speak Mandarin but cannot pronounce correctly, it is also necessary to study systematically; otherwise, the letters they know will not be able to connect with the pronunciation of Chinese characters and standard speech to play a role; even if they accidentally spell or pronounce a few Chinese characters correctly, they will still not have the certainty of judging right from wrong. Premier Zhou and Director Wu have both pointed out that the creation of phonetic alphabets and the promotion of phonetic alphabets are both for the service of Chinese characters, in order to enable more people to learn Chinese characters and use Chinese characters, not to eliminate Chinese characters and abolish dialects, nor to require all Han people to speak Mandarin as Beijingers, but only to unify pronunciation and unify the direction of speech. This clear direction with practicality fully demonstrates the ardent wishes and urgent demands of the broad masses of people in our country in cultural life. Such a clear direction, just like the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, has been destined to have a successful future.

The Party and the government are not satisfied with the existing achievements of "traditional Chinese medicine work," and are now organizing health administrative workers and medical research workers to conduct "special discussion of traditional Chinese medicine work" and discuss how to further and better "inherit and carry forward the heritage of national medicine." During this discussion, what everyone showed was: the enthusiasm for "traditional Chinese medicine work" is getting greater and greater, and the confidence in the "traditional Chinese medicine policy" is getting stronger and stronger; but there are still some disputes on the specific measures of related academic issues. For example, some people advocate mobilizing the vast number of Western medicine practitioners to learn the prescriptions and techniques of traditional Chinese medicine in a scattered, short-term, multi-point and wide-area way, believing that this is all the specific content of the "systematic learning and comprehensive mastery" indicated by the Party's "traditional Chinese medicine policy," and believing that the convergence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can be completely achieved in at most two years. Some people think that acupuncture, one of the many treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine, has the possibility of converging with modern medicine, and should be regarded as the only essence of national medicine, that is, the only content of inheritance and carrying forward work. Some people think that the theory and practice of national medicine are too rich, and it is impossible to learn them completely in three or five years, but because of the long-term devastation before liberation, there are very few old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who are proficient in traditional Chinese medicine, and there are not many middle-aged traditional Chinese medicine practitioners either. Now there is only a need to step up the training of new forces and mobilize middle-aged traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to study further, and there are no conditions to carry out convergence work. Some people think that the strength of traditional Chinese medicine is only in treatment experience, and theory has nothing to do with treatment; promoting the effective drugs, prescriptions, and techniques of traditional Chinese medicine is the only way to inherit and carry forward the national medicine. In addition to these frequently debated issues, the debate on whether there are prior and subsequent steps in "inheritance" and "carrying forward" also often appears in discussion meetings, and as for the issue of "reorganization and improvement," it has been diluted by other issues so that this item is still blank in the record of speeches. In short, every working comrade who participated in this discussion enthusiastically demanded that the work of traditional Chinese medicine be done more, faster, better, and more economically. This is the unanimous affirmation of everyone; just as some minority scholars who do not understand the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme clearly enough still have some different views on the use and pronunciation of individual letters, but their motives are unanimously to hope how to promote national culture and improve people's cultural life more, faster, better, and more economically, the same can be affirmed. Traditional Chinese medicine work, after this special discussion, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, will surely advance side by side with the promotion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme on the broad road of national cultural construction, and leap forward from victory to victory.

    参天古木　遍发嫩芽
    沈德建代表认为汉语拼音方案
    为发扬祖国文化开辟了大路
    我完全同意大会各项报告。汉语拼音方案草案的报告，提醒了我回忆到过去学习祖国文化的艰苦经过，提高了我认识到今后发扬祖国文化的灿烂前途，从而鼓舞了我今天对祖国文化问题来发言。
    汉语拼音方案的制订，必将使我国的文化建设高潮，随着经济建设的高潮，加速地到来。
    过去关怀文字语言问题的爱国人士，曾经要求清朝学部于一九○二年提出过“国语统一”的口号，曾经要求北洋政府于一九一二年提出过“读音统一”的口号，不少的文字学家、音韵学家、语言学家都曾经纷纷提供过各人试制字母的研究心得，也曾经制订过注音字母、国语罗马字；他们长期地共同地要求不仅要做到广大人民都能有一个容易学习汉字的工具，而且要做到广大人民都能有一个共同语言的方向。从来不肯关心人民文化生活的反动政府，当然不可能领导专家、集思广益、制订方案、来适应人民学习文化的需要；长期在水深火热的人民，当然更不可能有条件实现自己文化学习的要求。六十年的光阴已经过去了，六十年来的要求，终于实现了在人民政府的今天。汉语拼音方案的制订，和广大劳动人民如今正在积极学习汉语拼音字母的热烈情况，不能不使人们充分认识到政治的因素的伟大作用，不能不使人们充分认识到劳动人民在新社会生活中迫切需要文化的作用，这些作用必将会使我国的文化建设，随着经济建设的高潮，也加速地进入高潮。毫无疑问，汉语拼音方案的制订和公布，是中国人民在文化生活中的一件大喜事，我们应该热烈地表示庆祝和欢迎。
    汉字有独特的优点，但不是没有缺点，它的主要缺点是字形和字音之间没有直接联系。
    大家知道，汉字的字形能够充分表达字义，尽管语言隔阂，只要彼此认识汉字，就可以彼此达意通情，这是汉字的独特优点。汉字至今还能够担负着保存我国数千年来不断发展的历史文化的任务，这不能不使我们深深感谢汉字的功劳。大家知道，汉字不是没有缺点，汉字的主要缺点，就在字形和字音之间没有直接联系。虽然常常也有人说：“百分之九十以上的汉字，都是由‘表示声音’和‘表示意义’两个部分组成，只要认识‘表示声音’的部分，就可能知道读音。”但是全部汉字在表音方面告诉我们的事实，绝对不是这样简单。根据我过去三十多年以前对汉字表音方面的研究，教学几年；从前由研究和教学所获得的关于读音的一知半解，到现在差不多都已忘记了，使我到现在还留着深刻印象而没有完全忘记的，就只是汉字在表音方面的三个麻烦问题：（1）表音字数太多：作为表音的部分，不是一定数量的符号，原来还都是汉字，而且数量多得骇人听闻，包括向来无表音作用、又无同音字的少数孤音字，如“恩”、“怎”、“岑”、“森”、“僧”、“印”、“丢”等不到二十个少数字，总计有一千二百一十六个汉字。如此大量表音字的中间，又还有许多极不常用的冷僻字。这些冷僻字，学会了也等于白费功夫。例如，“读”、“续、“赎”、“牍”、“渎”、“诀”、“缺”、“决”。“抉”、“玦”这些字的右方偏旁，大家都知道是表音部分，但是作为表音的这个“卖”字，原来不是这样的字形，在汉朝时简化了几个笔画，才和“买卖”的“卖”字相像，但毕竟不许可认作“买卖”的“卖”字；作为表音的“夬”字，也不是“中央”的“央”字减少了一个笔画。“卖”、“夬”这两个字，究竟读甚么声音，作甚么解释，有甚么用处，恐怕请教会写文章、会作诗词的文学家，也未必都能有回答的把握。（2）表音位置不固定：千万不要相信有些人对于汉字读音所谓“上形下声、左形右声”的说法而发生错觉，就以为汉字表音的位置只有两个：不在下方就在右方；这是很大的错误。例如：“叩”、“致”、“墙”、“和”、“锦”、“顾”、“判”、“郊”、“豫”、“鸠”等字的表音，都在左方而不是“左形右声”；“币”、“掌”、“应”、“怠”、“奕”、“譬”、“辈”、“愁”、“禽”、“婆”等字的表音，都在上方而不是“上形下声”。还有许多汉字的字形，因长期屡经演变的结果，已经不可能再分出上下左右的位置，更不可能找出表音的部分在那一方。例如：“布”从“父”声，“年”从“千”声，“成”从“丁”声，“寺”从“之”声，“良”从“亡”声等等，如果不研究过文字学，就不可能知道这些字中，原来都还包含着有表音的成分。（3）表音不符现实：不是依靠少数字母来表示字音的汉字，因时代不同、因地域不同而发生读音不同的变化，这是很自然的。例如：从前都从“门”声读音的“问”、“闻”、“闷”、“闽”等字，现在都不读“门”，从前都从“艮”声读音的“很”、“限”、“银”、“眼”等字现在，都不读“艮”。历代研究有关读音的音韵学、训诂学、文字学，对于注音的方法和注音的内容，往往因时代、地域的不同，而不能不有不同的改变，就是这个原因。
    由于字形、字音都因时代、地域的不同，而各有不同变化的结果，使字形在排列和检查上，就有“540部首”、“220部首”、“214部首”、“分韵”、“分声”、“笔数”、“号码”等等的不同；使字音在检音和注音上，就有“读若”、“读同”、“读从”、“直音”、“反切”、“282韵”、“206韵”、“106韵”、“80韵”、“76韵”、“19部”、“18部”、“17部”、“16部”、“13辙”、“12摄”等等的不同，而同时随着又有“等呼”、“声调”、“阴阳”、“清浊”、“尖团”等等的不同变化。历代以来关于字形、字音的著作，是很多的。根据这很多书籍的记载，使我们知道字形、字音因时因地的变化情况和变化规律，从而使我们认识到变化有规律的读音、语音，为最有条件适宜于使用字母来注音和编制索引，因此，证明了过去在检音、注音方面所遭遇困难的原因，证明了过去在读音、语音方面所发生分歧的原因，都正是由于没有使用字母的必然结果。
    有独特优点的汉字和有独特优点的北京话，用方案中二十六个字母来保证读音、语音的正确而不致变化分歧，保证易于学习文化，这必将使汉字、汉语能发挥更大的作用。
    现在的北京话，常常被称赞如同音乐一样的优美好听，但是，假使如今不用字母来固定北京话的语音，再经过若干时期变迁以后，将来很可能变得比福建话、广东话还更难懂。全国汉语区域范围内的绝大部分，每个字音、语音都是分为五个声调；有些地区就分为六个声调、七个声调、八个声调不等。惟有北京话只分四个声调，因此北京话的基本音的数量，就比较最少，学起来也就比较容易；北京话在全国汉语区域当中，浊音比较最少，因此听起来，也显得清脆，这些都是北京话的独特优点。北京话的基本音，一共只有一千四百二十八个，如果不分别四个声调，就仅仅只有四百一十一个基本音。这四百一十一个基本音，全是由二十一个声母和三十五个韵母构成的。这二十一个声母和三十五个韵母，又全是由少数音素构成的，汉语拼音方案中的二十六个字母，正能充分表明这些音素的正确发音。只要能够掌握这二十六个字母的正确运用，就可能按照字母念出全部汉字和北京话的声音，这种“以简御繁”的注音方法，正是总结了中国历代学者的研究和世界各国人民的习惯对汉字注音的结晶。
    有独特优点的汉字和有独特优点的北京话，从此运用这二十六个字母来保证读音、语音的正确而不致变化分歧，保证学习文化的容易，而将必使汉字、汉语能发挥更大的作用，这是肯定的。这样一项有历史意义的革命措施，这样在祖国文化的原有基础上，运用移花接木的手段来发扬祖国文化，从此使祖国文化好像拔地参天的古树，忽然遍发了嫩芽；这与党中央和人民政府对待祖国医学遗产的措施，同样的英明。
    拉丁字母久已成为世界各国人民日常应用的文化工具，我国人民学起来也不会感觉生疏和艰难。
    经过长期发展的、对文化有巨大作用的拉丁字母，久已成为了全世界各国人民日常应用的文化工具，虽不是祖国自己固有的东西，但如今已经成为了我们祖国自己的字母，所以学起来也不会感觉生疏和艰难。又因为学习一种工具的使用方法，决不会像研究学术那么艰难。西医学术的发生根源和发展经过、以及在病理、诊断和治疗各方面的许多宝贵成就，与中医的理论体系完全不同，必须具备一定的科学知识基础的中医师，才可能理解其成就的可宝贵；学习西医学术上的知识，当然就不可能看做和学习拼音字母那么容易。仔细检查研究一根毫毛而忘记毫毛的另一端还联系着一个活人，虽不是西医当中绝对没有偶然的类似情况，但是只看森林而不顾枝叶的中医，也未必果能正确地掌握病理的全面。掌握整体全面变化和局部细微变化的病理关系而进行有效的医疗措施，这样的明医是很少的。为了要使自己业务好，赚钱多，经常做些宣传工作而不能专心钻研医学，这样出名的名医，在资本主义社会里，倒不是太少的。“明医”和“名医”这两个名词的含义根本不同，但在说起来和听起来，就完全一样，这也就附带地说明了汉字的作用，在今天还是很大的。终身研究中医的人，不一定就可能成为明医；长期钻研西医而成为明医的人，究竟也还是少数。这并非说医学比任何其他科学都艰深，而的确是今天的医学，不论西医或中医，在现代的一切科学中间，还是比较薄弱的一门科学，还存在着不少问题的答案是空白或疑难；正待医学有关的一切学者们，团结起来，融合众长，共同努力研究这项却病延年的学术，继续充实和提高。党和政府指出中西医学合流的方向，首先号召西医学习中医，这正是为着对人民提高保健学术和发展保健事业的方向，并非等于说中医比西医高明，也非等于说只要西医向中医学会了一方一技，就算做到了中西医学合流，更非等于说有条件学习西医的中医师，就可以不必再学西医。
    无论西医也好，中医也好，都是积累群众实践经验而后系统化再为群众服务的科学，而且这两个医学各在不同形式上、不同速度上各按原有体系，各向前继续发展。中西医学合流，虽是医学科学发展的必然趋势，但非将来实现合流以后，医学的发展，就永远地终止不前。处理“由简向繁”发展的一切事物，所采用的“以简御繁”的学术，这种学术仍然是学术发展中的一个过程。不断向前发展的任何一种学术，不可能一成不变，不可能百分之百地满足应用上的要求，更不可能避难就易、不经过系统学习而侥幸获得学术上的成就。在原有系统的基础上，逐步改造和提高，弥补缺陷、解决疑难，是一切学术发展的规律，是祖国医学遗产今后继续发展的方向，是汉语拼音方案产生的渊源。必须全面了解某种学术的全部内容，才可能发现是非好坏的所在，才可能对某种学术进行改造、提高和接受，所以系统学习应该看做学术上一切措施的必要过程。譬如有人看见汉语拼音方案中的字母，以为和自己已经知道的英文、法文或俄文的字母差不多，而不肯按照一定系统认真学习，结果必将不可能掌握这些字母如何运用来拼读汉字和校正方音。脱离系统而由点点滴滴的所得来的任何一种学术上的一鳞半爪，不但不可能掌握运用，有时还可能引导自己发生错误。正如买了一册辩证唯物主义的书籍而不肯从头到尾系统研究，仅仅只随便翻阅其中唯物部分的一小段或者辩证部分的一小段而自以为通晓哲学，其思想由此发展的结果，很有倾向费尔巴哈或黑格尔的可能。所以汉语拼音方案，对于不认识汉字的人们来说，固然必须认真地系统学习，就是已经学会了汉字而不懂普通话的人们，和能说普通话而不能正确读音的人们，也都有系统学习的必要；否则，必将使所认识的字母，对汉字读音和标准语音，始终不能联系起来发生作用；即算偶然凑巧地拼对了或读对了几个汉字的声音，也毕竟没有判定是非的把握。周总理和吴主任都已经指出过：创制拼音字母和推广拼音字母，都是为汉字服务，为了使更多的人学会汉字和使用汉字，并非消灭汉字和废除方言，也非要求全体汉族人民说得像北京人一样的普通话，只是统一读音、统一语音的方向。这个具备现实性的明确的方向，充分表明了我国广大人民在文化生活中的热烈愿望和迫切要求。如此明确的方向，正如中医政策一样，都已经注定了必能圆满成功的前途。
    党和政府不满足于“中医工作”的现有成就，如今正组织卫生行政工作者和医药研究工作者，进行“中医工作专题鸣放”、讨论如何更进一步地更好地“继承发扬祖国医学遗产”的政策方针。在这次进行讨论的期间，每人所表现的是：对“中医工作”的干劲，越来越大，对“中医政策”的信心，越来越坚；但是在有关学术问题的具体问题的措施上，也还存在着一些争论。例如：有人主张动员广大西医分散地、短期地、点多面广地向中医学习方药技术，认为这就是党对“中医政策”所指示的“系统学习、全面掌握”的全部具体内容，而认为至多两年就可以使中西医学完全合流。有人认为中医多种治疗方法之一的针灸学，已经有可能和现代医学合流，应该算是祖国医学的唯一精华，也就是继承发扬工作的唯一内容。有人认为祖国医学的理论和实践，都太丰富，不可能三五年学得完成，但因遭受了解放以前的长期摧残，精通中医的，老年中医已经很少，中年中医也不很多，现在只有加紧培养新生力量和发动中年中医师进修，还没有条件进行合流工作。有人认为中医的长处只是治疗经验，理论与治疗无关；推广中医有疗效的药物、方剂、技术，就是继承发扬祖国医学的唯一法门。除了这几个经常争论的问题之外，“继承”和“发扬”有无先后步骤的争论，也常常出现在讨论会中，至于“整理提高”的这个问题，就被其他问题冲淡得在发言纪录中至今还空白着这个项目。总而言之，参加这个讨论的每一位工作同志，都很热烈地要求把中医工作如何做得更多、更快、更好、更省，这是大家一致的肯定的；正如有些对汉语拼音方案了解还不够很明确的少数学者们，对个别字母的使用和发音，尽管还有些不同的看法，但动机都一致地希望如何更多、更快、更好、更省地发扬祖国文化和提高人民文化生活，同样地可以肯定。中医工作，经过这次专题鸣放以后，在党和政府的正确领导之下，必将和推广汉语拼音方案工作，并驾齐驱，在祖国文化建设的康庄大道上，飞跃前进，由胜利走向胜利。
