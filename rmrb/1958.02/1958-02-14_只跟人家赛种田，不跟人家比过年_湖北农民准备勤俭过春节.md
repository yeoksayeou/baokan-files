Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 13th. Many agricultural cooperative members in Hubei Province are determined to break with convention and celebrate the Spring Festival thriftily. In some agricultural cooperatives, a new atmosphere of "only competing with others in farming, not in celebrating the New Year" has emerged.

Many agricultural cooperatives are preparing to celebrate this year's Spring Festival both thriftily and joyfully. The Mutual Prosperity Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangyang County is preparing various props for Spring Festival entertainment programs such as dragon dances and蚌壳戏 (bàng ké xì, a kind of folk opera), all of which are made using old materials or by the cooperative members themselves, without buying anything new, saving more than 100 yuan on this item alone. The members of the Qunli Agricultural Cooperative in Mianyang County have already drawn up a plan for celebrating the Spring Festival thriftily. Around the Spring Festival this year, fifteen households in the cooperative are marrying daughters or taking daughters-in-law. According to past customs, each household would have to invite at least five tables of guests, but now these dozen or so households have decided to only prepare some tea and snacks to entertain guests. According to the plans for thrifty Spring Festival celebrations drawn up by each household, the entire cooperative can save a total of more than 5,900 yuan in terms of inviting guests, giving gifts, and giving "lucky money." Twenty households in the cooperative have decided not to boil sugar, and 320 households will boil less sugar, saving a total of 18,900 jin of rice. Cooperative member Zhou Chuantong originally planned to spend 100 yuan on the Spring Festival, but now he has decided to invest this 100 yuan in the agricultural cooperative.

In order to educate cooperative members to celebrate the festival thriftily, some agricultural cooperatives have launched discussions on issues such as thrifty festival celebrations and making ends meet. Some cooperative members of the Shengli Cooperative in Tongcheng County believe that after working hard for a year, they should eat and drink well during the festival. The cooperative found a typical household that was thrifty and happy, and a typical household that liked to show off and overeat during the festival, which led to difficult living, and mobilized everyone to compare and discuss. After discussion and publicity, the cooperative members unanimously stated that this year they would definitely celebrate the Spring Festival in the spirit of spending less money, eating well, and having fun.

    湖北农民准备勤俭过春节
    新华社武汉13日电　湖北省许多农业社社员决心打破常规，勤俭过春节。有些农业社内出现了“只跟人家赛种田，不跟人家比过年”的新风气。
    许多农业社准备又勤俭又欢乐地过好今年春节。襄阳县共同富裕农业社为春节准备的滚龙舞、蚌壳戏等文娱节目的各项道具，都是利用旧的或由社员自己做，一律不买新的，这一项就节约一百多元。沔阳县群力农业社的社员们已订出勤俭过春节的计划。今年春节前后，全社有十五户嫁女或娶媳妇，按照以往习惯，每户至少要请五桌客，现在这十几户都决定只备些茶点招待客人。根据各户订出的勤俭过春节计划，全社在请客、送礼、送“压岁钱”等方面，一共可节约五千九百多元。全社有二十户决定不熬糖，三百二十户少熬糖，共可节省大米一万八千九百斤。社员周传同原来准备花一百元过春节，现在决定把这一百元投资到农业社里。
    为了教育社员勤俭过节，有些农业社就俭省过节、细水长流等问题开展讨论。通城县胜利社有的社员认为一年忙到头，过节要好好吃喝一顿。社里找出一个勤俭持家、生活愉快的典型户，一个爱讲排场、过节大吃大喝因而生活困难的典型户，发动大家对比着讨论。经过讨论和宣传，社员们一致表示：今年一定本着花钱少，吃得好、玩得热闹的精神过春节。
