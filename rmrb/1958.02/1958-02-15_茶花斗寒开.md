　　In the season of the New Year, plum blossoms, winter plum blossoms, and camellias bloom in unison. Although plum blossoms and winter plum blossoms excel in fragrance and color, the lack of green leaves to set them off inevitably adds to a sense of melancholy. Camellias are different. Although they lack intoxicating fragrance, their leaves are evergreen, remaining vibrant throughout the winter. Therefore, in contrast, the red flowers and green leaves appear exceptionally beautiful. Hundreds of years ago, ancient people used them to enrich their living environment, planting them around tall buildings. When early spring arrived, all kinds of flowers bloomed together. Climbing up the building and looking out, a scene of "ten-foot brocade screens opening to the green fields, two rows of red powder embracing the vermilion building" was enough to feast one's eyes upon.

　　There are about two types of camellias cultivated in China. The large-flowered type is called the large camellia, also known in ancient books as the Southern Mountain Camellia, a specialty of Yunnan. The Southern Mountain Camellia is an evergreen tree with a sparse trunk and smooth bark. The leaves are deep green but lack luster, and the teeth on the edges of the leaves are fine and sharp. The flowers range in color from crimson to deep purple. The small-flowered type is called the small camellia, generally known as the camellia. It is mainly produced in the provinces south of the Yangtze River and in Japan. There are also large trees in the Dengying Village area west of Laoshan in Qingdao, which is the northernmost area where it resides in China. The small camellia is an evergreen shrub. The leaves are smaller than those of the large camellia, but they are glossy, and the teeth on the edges of the leaves are undulating like waves. The flowers are mainly red and white.

　　According to local chronicles, the large camellias cultivated in Yunnan have a history of more than four hundred years. At present, in the southern Yunnan area, almost every park or private residence has a few pots. Some use them as gifts, others as dowries for their daughters. In larger temples, there are also old trees that are over a hundred years old. Old age seems to imply "decay," but not for camellias. Old trees bloom even more profusely. They bloom right around the Spring Festival, not only decorating the festive atmosphere but also making it easier for more working people to appreciate them. Small camellias grow in a wider area. There are camellia trees in the Dengying Village area of Qingdao, locally known as "Nai Dong" (Winter Endurance).

　　Camellias prefer a warm, humid climate and loose, fertile, acidic soil. The planting site should be chosen in a place that does not accumulate water and has shade. When planting, place some crushed cow and sheep horn shavings at the base as fertilizer. Avoid drought in spring, and apply some mature human manure in summer for more vigorous growth. Camellias are also suitable for potting. For indoor cultivation, dense shade is required in summer, while sufficient sunlight is needed in winter. Too high a temperature can easily cause bud drop, generally requiring a low temperature of 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. They need a lot of water during the growing and flowering periods, but during the growth dormancy period, water should be reduced and kept as cool as possible. To make the flowers bloom larger, some of the small flower buds can also be removed.

　　Camellia flowers are not only beautiful but also long-lasting. If used for flower arranging, they are suitable for decorating studies and living rooms. The poet Lu Fangweng wrote, "Only the small camellia is particularly durable, with several red branches blooming again in the green bushes." It is a relatively rare flower among the flowering plants.

　　Loving camellias may lead one to want to cultivate them oneself. If camellias are propagated by seeds, the seeds contain a high oil content, so they are not easy to store. They must be sown into the soil immediately after harvesting. It takes four to five years to flower, and the flowers are not very attractive. To cultivate good flowers, young branches with leaves from good flowers can be cut in summer and placed in a sand box indoors, keeping them moist and cool. They will only take root after one or two months. To make good flowers bloom in a short period of time, one can only graft the branches of good varieties and inferior varieties together. The bark at the grafting point should be cut away, and then they should be tightly bound with hemp rope and wrapped with paper. They can only grow independently from the good varieties after about one hundred days of successful grafting.

　　Camellias can not only be used to beautify our environment, but their seeds can also be pressed for oil. This oil can be used for hairdressing, rust prevention, lighting, and consumption. Camellia wood can be used for carving and making agricultural implements. Camellias can also be used for medicinal purposes, mainly for treating gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoptysis, and other conditions. If the flowers are ground into powder and mixed with sesame oil, they can also be used as an external medicine for burns and scalds. Therefore, it is a very common plant to cultivate among the people in our country.

    茶花斗寒开
    紫帆
    新春时节，梅花、腊梅和茶花不约而同的盛开了，梅花和腊梅虽然优于香色，可惜好花没有绿叶掩映，难免使人徒增惆怅。茶花则不同，它虽缺少醉人的芬香，然而它的叶子却是四季常青，经冬不脱，因此对比起来，却显得红花绿叶娇艳万分。几百年前，古人就用它来丰富自己的生活环境，栽在高楼四周，一到早春，万花齐开，登楼而望，一幅“十丈锦屏开绿野，两行红粉拥朱楼”的景色，就够人饱餐的了。
    我国栽培的茶花约有两种，花大的叫大茶花，古籍上又称为南山茶，是云南的特产。南山茶是常绿乔木，树干高疏，树皮光滑，叶子深绿但缺光彩，叶边上的齿牙细而尖锐，花朵有浸红至深紫等色。花小的一种叫小茶花，一般就叫山茶花。它主要产于长江流域以南各省和日本，青岛崂山以西的登瀛村一带还有大树，这是它在我国住居的最北地区。小茶花是常绿灌木，叶子虽比大茶花小一些，但有光泽，叶边上的齿牙有如波浪起伏，花的颜色主要是红白二色。
    云南栽培的大茶花，据地方志载，已有四百年以上历史。目前滇南一带，不论公园或私宅，几乎都养上几盆，有的把它作为馈赠的礼物，有的作为女儿的嫁妆。在较大的寺庙里，还有百年以上的老树。老似乎就应当“衰”，而茶花则不然，老树开花更加繁盛；它又正当春节前后开花，不但装饰了节日的欢容，也便于更多的劳动人民去欣赏。小茶花生长地区比较广泛，青岛登瀛村一带还有茶花大树，当地称为“耐冬”。
    茶花欢喜温暖潮湿的气候和轻松肥沃的酸性土。栽植处要选择不积水而有阴蔽的地方，栽时基部放些牛、羊角蹄碎屑作肥料。春季切忌干旱，夏季再施些熟人粪尿，生长更能旺盛。茶花还适于盆栽，家庭室内栽植，夏季要浓阴，冬季则须有充足的阳光。温度过高，容易落蕾，一般须保持摄氏七度到十度的低温中。它生长期和开花期需水多，生长休止时，给水又须减少并尽量保持阴凉。要想花开得大，还可以把细小的花芽摘去一些。
    茶花的花朵不但美丽而且耐久，如果用它来插瓶，不论装点书斋、客室无一不宜。诗人陆放翁写道“惟有小茶偏耐久，绿丛又放数枝红”，它是花木类中比较难得的。
    爱茶花也许就想自己来培养它。茶花的繁殖如果采用种子播种，由于种子含油分很高所以不容易贮藏，必须采后就播入土中，四、五年后才能开花，而花也不十分中看。要培植好花，可以在夏季剪取好花的嫩枝带叶放在室内的砂土箱里，时常保持温润和阴凉，一、二月后才能生根。要想在短期内开好花，就只有把好种和劣种的枝条靠在一起。两枝靠处要削去一块皮，然后再用麻皮将它们捆紧，外用纸包裹，经一百天接活后才可脱离好种独立生长。
    茶花不仅可以用来美化我们的环境，而且它的种子还可榨油，这种油可以用来理发、防锈、点灯和食用。茶花树的木材可以雕刻和作农具。而茶花还可供药用，主治肠胃出血、咳血等症。如果将花研成末和麻油调和，还可作烫伤和火伤的外用药，所以它在我国民间是栽培很普遍的一种植物。
