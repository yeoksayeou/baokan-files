Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 22nd: The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently inspected the spring planting preparations throughout the province and pointed out that all preparatory work for the Great Leap Forward in production must be done practically and reliably before the spring planting.

The Provincial Party Committee requested that all localities launch another major inspection of spring planting preparations after the Spring Festival. Through this inspection, another high tide of water conservancy construction should be launched, and measures should be taken to ensure the quality of water conservancy projects. In addition, efforts should be made to accumulate another 3 billion dan of raw fertilizer before the spring planting. Together with the 3 billion dan already accumulated, this is equivalent to more than 3 billion dan of standard fertilizer, which can ensure an average application of 110 dan of fertilizer per mu for the province's 27 million mu of spring-sown crops.

Regarding seeds, farm tools, and draught cattle, the Provincial Party Committee found in its inspection that some areas were slow to act, and the preparations in some areas were not adapted to the situation of the Great Leap Forward. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that because the area for single-season crops converted to double-season crops and mid-season rice converted to early-season rice has greatly increased this year, the seeds originally stored by the communes are far from meeting the needs. Areas with seeds have not seized the time to transport the seeds to the communes. The Provincial Party Committee requested that counties immediately organize agricultural and grain departments to conduct a surplus and deficiency check of seeds throughout the county, organize allocation, and transport the seeds to the communes before the end of February. In order to ensure the smooth progress of spring planting, efforts should also be made to take care of draught cattle and to add, repair, and maintain farm tools as early as possible, as well as to manage winter crops in the fields.

    把大跃进建立在可靠的基础上
    江西省委检查备耕工作
    据新华社南昌22日电　中共江西省委最近检查了全省的备耕工作，指出春耕前必须把生产大跃进的一切准备工作做得切实可靠。
    省委要求各地在春节以后，立即展开一次备耕工作大检查，通过检查，再一次掀起兴修水利运动的高潮，并采取措施保证水利工程质量。另外，要争取在春耕前再积原肥三十亿担，连同已积起的三十亿担，约折合标准肥三十多亿担，这样就可以保证全省二千七百万亩春播作物平均每亩施肥一百一十担。
    关于种籽、农具、耕牛问题，省委从检查中发现，有些地区行动迟缓，有些地区的准备工作不能适应大跃进的形势。省委指出，由于今年各地单季改双季、中稻变早稻的面积大大增加，原来以社为单位贮备的种籽已远不能满足需要。有种籽的地区还没有抓紧时间把种籽调运到社。省委要求应以县为单位，立即组织农业和粮食部门对全县种籽进行一次余缺检查，组织调剂，并在2月底以前把种籽运送到社。为了保证春耕生产的顺利进行，还应及早做好耕牛养护和农具的添置、修补工作，以及冬季作物的田间管理工作。
