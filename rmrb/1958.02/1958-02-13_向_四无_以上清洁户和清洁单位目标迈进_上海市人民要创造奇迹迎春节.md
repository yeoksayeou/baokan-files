Striving Towards "Four-Without" or Higher Standard Clean Households and Clean Units
Shanghai People Will Create Miracles to Greet the Spring Festival

(Our Dispatch) Shanghai's patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the "Seven Pests" (the four pests plus bedbugs, snails, and cockroaches), is unfolding vigorously throughout the city with overwhelming momentum. Over 80% of citizens have participated in the campaign, and hundreds of "Five-Without," "Six-Without," and "Seven-Without" units have already emerged.

Since the Shanghai Second Municipal People's Congress's Third Session adopted the resolution on January 5th to basically transform Shanghai into a "Seven-Without" city within three years, the Municipal People's Committee immediately convened an enlarged administrative meeting. It established the Patriotic Health Campaign Leading Group of Ten, headed by Vice Mayor Liu Jiping, to strengthen leadership over the campaign. Various districts have also established leading groups composed of Party and government leaders. At all district People's Congresses, eliminating the "Seven Pests" was listed as a major agenda item, and plans for eliminating the seven pests were discussed. Most district People's Representatives participated in inspections, and some even participated in intensive pest elimination activities targeting weak links and key areas.

This campaign is being carried out on the basis of rectification and eliminating bureaucracy, therefore the entire city is filled with revolutionary vigor and the mobilization of the masses is extensive and deep. According to incomplete statistics, about two million government cadres, youth, and citizens had already invested in the movement in the half-month before the Municipal People's Congress convened. After the People's Congress issued the mobilization call for a general offensive against the "Seven Pests," the number rapidly increased to more than four million within ten days, and currently about 80% of the citizens have invested in one to two or three rounds of intensive activities; many government cadres have repeatedly supported compulsory labor in places where the "Seven Pests" breed. On January 16th, the temperature dropped to seven degrees below zero, the coldest day in Shanghai since liberation, but nearly 600,000 people still fought tenaciously against the "Seven Pests." On January 19th, the Municipal Women's Federation mobilized women to participate in intensive pest elimination. According to inspections, more than 82% of families had carried out pest elimination and cleaning work. For example, all residents of Fuxin Lane in Putuo District participated in the offensive. The seafarer hospital thoroughly cleaned up the warehouse that had not been moved in thirty years, and the counter of Fengtaixiang in Yideli, Yangshupu District, had not been cleaned in twenty-eight years, but this time it was thoroughly cleaned up, yielding more than eighty catties of garbage and more than one catty of copper coins.

In the past month, the battle has achieved brilliant results. Xuhui District has seen the emergence of twenty-nine "Six-Without" units, including one hundred and one grassroots units such as vegetable markets and shops. Putuo District has seen the emergence of five "Six-Without" neighborhoods, such as Fuxin Lane, and twenty-five "Six-Without" vegetable markets. As for units that have achieved "Three-Without" or "Four-Without," and households that have achieved "Four-Without" or higher, there are even more. Currently, Huangpu and Putuo districts have completely eliminated fly pupae before mid-January. Approximately 100,000 manure tanks and more than 9,600 garbage bins throughout the city have had fly pupae eliminated through pupae digging or compaction of soil. Many manure tanks have been partially centralized, and those exceeding requirements have been banned. Based solely on the figures reported by the fifty-eight report-good-news teams from various districts at the ten-thousand-person conference on January 25th, more than 100,000 rats were killed, more than 57,000 rat holes were blocked, and more than 48,000 sparrows were killed in mid-January. In addition, many depressions and stinking ditches were filled in. The basements of large buildings throughout the city have basically completed mosquito extermination by smoke, killing countless overwintering mosquitoes and flies.

In order to further develop the movement, on January 25th, the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee convened the year's first large-scale inspection and competition mobilization meeting in the Cultural Square, attended by more than 13,000 representatives from government agencies, schools, factories, neighborhoods, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives. More than 3,000 guarantee letters and more than 100 challenge letters were presented on the spot. At the meeting, Vice Mayor Liu Jiping announced the first large-scale inspection and competition method, which focused on comparing the size of drive and the quality of results. General Liu Fei, commander of the garrison, and responsible comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting this method. At the meeting, Yangpu District also issued a friendly challenge to Putuo District, and the Public Security Bureau challenged the Health Bureau, etc. All the challenged units and regions also rose up to accept the challenge. Many of the conditions for challenging and accepting challenges are to strive to achieve "Five-Without," "Six-Without," and "Seven-Without" in their respective systems before the Spring Festival. Then, Vice Mayor Liu Jiping called for creating one thousand "Four-Without" to "Seven-Without" clean units and one hundred thousand "Four-Without" to "Seven-Without" clean households before the Spring Festival. He also called on everyone to plant six million trees to green and beautify Shanghai. Finally, a "Letter of Determination" was read out to express the heroic spirit of the seven million people fighting against the "Seven Pests."

After the meeting, the enthusiasm of the masses further increased, and every household is striving towards creating "Four-Without" or higher standard clean households and "Four-Without" or higher standard clean units before the Spring Festival. On January 26th, despite wind and snow, 300,000 people throughout the city still participated in the intensive elimination of the "Seven Pests." According to incomplete statistics at the end of January, approximately 600,000 households and more than 5,000 units throughout the city had proposed to achieve "Four-Without" or higher before the Spring Festival, greatly exceeding the original target. Many regions and units have also revised their plans again on this basis. For example, the original plan of Yulin District was to basically eliminate the "Seven Pests" within two years, but it has now been revised to basically eliminate them in the first quarter. The Public Security Bureau, the Health Bureau, and other bureaus have also decided to basically eliminate the "Seven Pests" within their respective systems in the first quarter. (Wen)

### 向“四无”以上清洁户和清洁单位目标迈进  上海市人民要创造奇迹迎春节

    向“四无”以上清洁户和清洁单位目标迈进
    上海市人民要创造奇迹迎春节
    本报讯　上海市以消灭“七害”（四害以外加臭虫、钉螺、蟑螂）为中心的爱国卫生运动，正以排山倒海的声势在全市蓬勃展开。80％以上的市民都已投入了运动，并且已经出现了成百的“五无”、“六无”、“七无”单位。
    自从1月5日上海市二届三次人民代表大会作出了在三年内基本上把上海变为“七无”城市的决议之后，市人民委员会立即召开了行政扩大会议，成立了以刘季平副市长为首的爱国卫生运动十人领导小组，加强了对运动的领导。各区也多已成立了有党政负责人组成的领导小组。在所有各区人代大会上，都将消灭“七害”列为主要议程，并且讨论了消灭七害的规划；大多数区人民代表都参加了检查，有的还参加了深入薄弱环节和重点对象的除害突击活动。
    这次运动是在整改和打掉官气的基础上开展的，因而全市充满了革命干劲，动员群众十分深广。据不完全统计，市人民代表大会召开以前的半个月中就已经有机关干部、青少年和市民约二百万人投入运动。人民代表大会发出了向“七害”总进攻的动员号召之后，十天内就迅速增加为四百多万人，目前已约有80％以上的市民投入一次至二、三次的突击活动；不少机关干部多次支援了“七害”孳生场所的义务劳动。1月16日，气温降到零下七度，是上海解放以来最冷的一天，但是仍有近六十万群众和“七害”作顽强斗争。1月19日市妇联发动妇女参加突击除害，据检查，有82％以上的家庭都进行了除害清扫工作。如普陀区福新里居民就全部参加了突击。海员医院彻底清除了三十年未动过的库房，杨树浦区怡德里丰泰祥的柜台二十八年未打扫，这次也彻底清扫出八十多斤垃圾和斤余铜元。
    一个月以来，战果成绩辉煌。徐汇区已出现了包括一百零一个菜场、商店等基层的二十九个“六无”单位，普陀区出现了福新里等五个“六无”里弄和二十五个“六无”菜场。至于做到“三无”“四无”的单位和做到“四无”以上的住户，则更多。目前，黄浦、普陀二区已经在1月中旬以前将蝇蛹全部消灭干净。全市约十万只粪缸和九千六百多只垃圾箱的蝇蛹已经过挖蛹或紧土消灭；许多粪缸都实行了小量集中，超过需要的已加取缔。仅就各区各条五十八个报喜队在1月25日万人大会上汇报的1月中旬的战果数字，灭鼠十万多只，堵塞鼠洞五万七千多个，灭雀四万八千多只。此外还填平了许多洼地、臭水沟浜。全市大楼地下室已基本上完成了烟熏灭蚊，杀灭过冬蚊蝇无数。
    为了使运动更深入发展，1月25日，市爱国卫生运动委员会在文化广场召开了机关、学校、工厂、里弄、企业、农业社代表一万三千多人参加的本年第一次大检查、大评比动员大会，当场提出了三千多封保证信和一百多封挑战书。会上，刘季平副市长宣布了以比干劲大小、成绩好坏为主的第一次大检查、大评比办法，在会上讲话的还有警备部司令员刘飞中将，市工联、妇联、团市委负责同志等，他们一致拥护这一办法。会上还有杨浦区对普陀区、公安局向卫生局等等提出了友谊挑战。所有被挑战的单位、地区也都奋起应战。不少挑应战的条件是争取春节前即在本系统做到“五无”“六无”“七无”。接着刘季平副市长号召在春节前创造一千个“四无”至“七无”的清洁单位和十万个“四无”至“七无”的清洁户。并号召人人动手种树六百万株，绿化和美化上海。最后，又宣读了“决心书”来表示七百万人民向“七害”作斗争的英雄气概。
    会后，群众干劲进一步高涨，家家户户都在向春节前创造“四无”以上清洁户和“四无”以上清洁单位奋进。1月26日风雪交加，但全市仍有三十万群众投入突击除“七害”活动。根据1月底不完全统计，全市约已有六十万户和五千多单位提出了在春节前做到“四无”以上，已大大超过了原号召指标。不少地区和单位也都在这一基础上再次修正了规划。如榆林区原定规划二年内基本消灭“七害”，现已修正为第一季度基本消灭。公安、卫生等局也都定在第一季度在本系统做到基本消灭“七害”。（文）
