    A Golden Key
    Hunan Province has started a new task in the New Year – gradually making the province's small mountain rivers make great contributions to the people. This can achieve three goals with one arrow: irrigating farmland, improving transportation, and developing industry.
    In the past, when people talked about utilizing water resources, they often neglected small rivers. This was because people only saw their shortcomings: short rivers, small water power, and scattered locations. However, the comrades in Hunan Province looked at the problem from another perspective: although small rivers are short, they have water all year round and can be greatly utilized; their scattered locations are perfect for connecting the vast mountainous areas. Based on this understanding, they reversed the past attitude of non-leadership and instead adopted unified leadership, comprehensive planning, and comprehensive utilization. Thus, the small rivers that were not paid much attention to in the past have now become the golden key to opening up, prospering, and building mountainous areas.
    Many mountainous areas in the South have natural conditions similar to those in Hunan. If they can all learn from Hunan's methods and comprehensively utilize the thousands upon thousands of small rivers, the effect would be truly immeasurable.

    一把金钥匙
    湖南省在新春又开始了一件新的工作——逐步使全省山区的小河道为人民作出大贡献。这样作可以一箭三雕：灌溉农田，改善交通，发展工业。
    过去，人们谈到利用水利资源，每每忽视了小河道。这是因为人们只看到它的短处：河流短，水力小，位置分散。但是，湖南省的同志从另一方面来看这问题：小河道虽短，但终年有水，大可利用；位置分散，正好利用来联系广大的山区。基于这种认识，一反过去不加领导的态度而为统一领导，全面规划，综合利用。于是一向不大为人注意的小小河道，现在，成了打开开发山区、繁荣山区、建设山区的金钥匙。
    南方有许多山区自然条件和湖南大同小异，如果都能学习湖南的办法，把千千万万小河道综合利用起来，那作用真是不可估计。
