(Reported comprehensively by this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The French Air Force, which is waging a colonial war against the Algerian people, barbarously attacked Tunisian territory and residents on the morning of February 8th. Twenty-five French bombers and fighter planes bombed and strafed the village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef, located within the Tunisian border adjacent to Algeria, for more than an hour, killing approximately one hundred residents and wounding approximately eighty. All the students of a primary school were killed. Two-thirds of the entire village was destroyed, including the village government, the post office, and some houses.

Tunisian President Bourguiba held an emergency cabinet meeting the same day after the incident occurred, and delivered a radio address in the evening, announcing that Tunisia would recall its ambassador to France, Mohamed Masmoudi, for "consultations," and announced a ban on the movement of French troops stationed in Tunisia. Bourguiba also demanded that French troops withdraw from all Tunisian territory, including the naval base at Bizerte. Bourguiba also stated that Tunisia would submit the French Air Force's attack on Tunisia to the United Nations for handling.

The French Air Force's atrocities aroused a wave of angry protests from the Tunisian people. Tunisian workers announced a 24-hour national general strike of protest starting on the 10th. Government authorities received hundreds of telegrams from all over the country in one day protesting the French atrocities. Many shops also announced a strike, expressing condolences to the victims of the air raid.

A grand funeral was held for the victims on the 9th, with five senior Tunisian government officials in attendance. In a funeral oration, the Secretary of State of the Presidential Office, Radham, vehemently criticized the French air raid as an "unprecedented barbaric act." He pointed out that all of the targets bombed were non-military.

Diplomatic envoys from Arab countries and Islamic countries stationed in Tunisia expressed their condolences to President Bourguiba on the 9th for the victims of the air raid. On the same day, the King of Morocco also sent a telegram expressing support for Tunisia.

The Egyptian cabinet held a meeting on the evening of the 9th to discuss the French Air Force's attack on Tunisian residents. Egyptian Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Sabri, told reporters after the meeting: "The Egyptian government is ready to provide assistance to the Tunisian government in all aspects." The Egyptian and Tunisian governments are in contact regarding this incident.

The Cairo "People's Daily" said on the 9th that the United States should be held responsible for the French atrocities. The planes and weapons used by France to attack the Algerian and Tunisian people were all made in the United States and were given to France by the United States for use by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The people of North Arabia will never forget this stain in American history.

Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali, commenting on the French Air Force's attack on Tunisian residents, said that we condemn this criminal aggression, and the United Arab Republic and all Arab countries are shocked by this criminal and despicable act. He also said: "While we condemn France's actions, we announce our full support for our sister country Tunisia, and we announce that we are ready to help it in all aspects."

Algerian National Liberation Front representative Mohammed Yazid told the press in New York on the 9th that the French aircraft bombing of peaceful Tunisian residents shows that "France is not only using force to maintain its colonial rule in Algeria, but also pursuing a policy of hegemony in North Africa. This French policy is supported by the United States government in material, financial, and diplomatic terms."

The statement said: "The North African war is now gradually evolving into a conflict between the Western alliance and the will of the North African people to seek liberation."

According to news from Washington, the United States government is "uneasy" about this incident, which seriously affects Franco-Tunisian relations. It is reported that the United States intends to use all diplomatic means to "mediate" in order to avoid causing more divisions within the North Atlantic Group, and also to avoid affecting Tunisia's relations with the West. Dulles met with French Ambassador Alphand on the evening of the 9th specifically for this matter.

    法空军狂炸突尼斯人民
    突总统要法国驻军全部滚出去
    埃及和叙利亚准备援助突尼斯
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：正在对阿尔及利亚人民进行殖民战争的法国空军8日上午对突尼斯领土和居民进行了野蛮的袭击。二十五架法军轰炸机和战斗机对同阿尔及利亚接壤的突尼斯边境以内的萨基埃特·西迪·优素福村进行了一个多小时的轰炸和机枪扫射，炸死居民约一百人，炸伤约八十人。一个小学校的全体学生都被炸死。整个村子的三分之二被摧毁，其中包括村政府、邮局和一部分房舍。
    突尼斯总统布尔吉巴当天在事件发生以后举行了紧急内阁会议，并且在晚间发表了广播演说，宣布突尼斯将召回驻法大使穆罕默德·马斯穆迪进行“磋商”，并且宣布禁止驻在突尼斯境内的法国军队调动。布尔吉巴同时要求法军从突尼斯的全部领土上撤出，包括从比塞大的海军基地撤出。布尔吉巴并且表示，突尼斯将把法国空军袭击突尼斯事件提交联合国处理。
    法国空军的暴行引起了突尼斯人民的抗议怒潮。突尼斯工人宣布从10日起举行二十四小时全国性抗议总罢工。政府当局在一天之内就接到了好几百封来自全国各地的电报，抗议法国的暴行。不少商店也宣布罢市，对空袭死难者表示哀悼。
    9日为死难者举行了隆重的葬礼，突尼斯政府有五个高级官员参加。总统办公厅国务秘书拉德哈姆在葬礼演说中猛烈抨击法国的空袭暴行是一次“史无前例的野蛮行动”。他指出，遭到轰炸的全是非军事性目标。
    阿拉伯各国及回教国家驻突尼斯的外交使节9日向布尔吉巴总统表示了对空袭死难者的哀悼。同一天，摩洛哥国王也拍电报对突尼斯表示声援。
    埃及内阁9日晚间举行会议讨论法国空军袭击突尼斯居民事件。埃及负责总统事务的国务部长萨布里在会后对记者说：“埃及政府已经准备好在一切方面向突尼斯政府提供援助。”埃及和突尼斯政府正在就这次事件进行接触。
    开罗“人民报”9日说，美国要对法国的暴行负责。法国用来进攻阿尔及利亚人民和突尼斯人民的飞机和武器都是美国制造的，并且是由美国交给法国作为供北大西洋公约组织使用的。阿拉伯北部人民决不会忘记美国历史上的这个污点。
    叙利亚总理阿萨利在评论法国空军袭击突尼斯居民事件时说，我们谴责这种罪恶的侵略，阿拉伯联合共和国和所有阿拉伯国家对这个罪恶的、卑鄙的行为感到震惊。他又说：“在我们谴责法国行动的同时，我们宣布全力支持我们的姊妹国家突尼斯，而且宣布我们准备在各方面帮助它。”
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表穆罕默德·雅齐德9日在纽约向报界发表声明说，法国飞机轰炸突尼斯的和平居民的这次侵略行动表明，“法国不仅在用武力维持它在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，而且在北非实行霸占政策。法国的这种政策，得到美国政府在物质、财政和外交上的支持。”
    声明说：“北非战争现在正在逐渐演变成西方国家联盟同北非人民力求解放的意志之间的冲突。”
    据华盛顿传来的消息说，美国政府对这一严重影响法突关系的事件很感“不安”。有消息说，美国打算使用一切外交手段来从中进行“调解”，以便不使这次事件在北大西洋集团中引起更多的分裂，同时也避免影响突尼斯同西方的关系。杜勒斯特地为这件事在9日晚上会见了法国大使阿尔芳。
