	More Procurement, More Supply
	Wholesale Commerce Leaps Forward
	Tianjin Hardware Procurement and Supply Station Proposes Initiative

	Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 25th. Inspired by the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store's revolutionary initiative to improve work, the employees of the Tianjin Hardware and Machinery Procurement and Supply Station have formulated a work innovation plan. On February 24th, they issued a proposal to all procurement and supply stations in Tianjin, requesting that the employees of each supply station show their energy and make a great leap forward in wholesale commerce.
	This is the first unit in the national production materials wholesale commerce to put forward a proposal. The guarantee conditions proposed by the employees of this procurement and supply station in their proposal are: vigorously support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and actively find ways to expand the 1958 procurement and supply plan. The procurement amount will be increased by 110 million yuan, an increase of 55.24% over the original plan, and the number of procured varieties will be increased by 78. The supply amount will be increased by 120 million yuan, an increase of 68.8% over the original plan, and the supplied goods will mainly be equipment for rural water conservancy construction. In order to assist industrial departments in improving product quality, we will try to collect samples and data of advanced products at home and abroad for industrial departments to study, and hold a quality evaluation exhibition every quarter; at the same time, we will send people to agricultural cooperatives, water conservancy construction sites, repair shops, etc. to understand the needs, and guide industrial production, so as to achieve varieties that are marketable, specifications that are suitable, quality and price that are commensurate, and timely supply. Storage, transportation, finance, and accounting departments must cooperate closely to reduce the waiting time for goods from 9.23 days in January to 2 days in April, and goods directly allocated by factories should account for 70% of all shipped goods. The annual capital turnover rate should be increased from the original 5.248 times to 7.2 times, and the cost of commodity circulation should be reduced by 1.97% compared with the plan. In terms of commodity storage, we must ensure no rust damage and no deterioration. Ensure that all business personnel are familiar with all work within the scope of the subject within one year, and business and storage personnel should be familiar with the physical properties, use and protection methods of the commodities they operate.
	The employees of this station have now taken action to realize this initiative. In order to shorten the waiting time for goods, the employees of the storage and transportation department first broke the convention of not shipping goods at night, adjusted the labor organization, and changed to shipping goods day and night. The warehouse keepers of each warehouse have also taken measures to ensure that goods are unloaded in time as soon as the trucks arrive. Storage, transportation, finance, accounting, business and other departments cooperate closely and implement the working method of "balanced planning of procurement, sales, and transportation." When handling procurement and supply procedures, the relevant sections have changed the past assembly line method to simultaneous progress, ensuring that the goods received from the factory on the same day can be received, packed, equipped with vehicles, and shipped out on the same day. This greatly shortens the waiting time for goods and accelerates the speed of capital turnover.

    多进货　多供应
    批发商业投入跃进行列
    天津五金采购供应站提出倡议
    新华社天津25日电　天津五金机械采购供应站的职工，受到北京天桥百货商场改进工作的革命倡议的鼓舞，订出革新工作的方案，在24日向天津市各采购供应站发出倡议，要求各供应站的职工拿出干劲，在批发商业上来个大跃进。
    这是全国生产资料批发商业中第一个提出倡议的单位。这个采购供应站职工在倡议书中提出的保证条件是：大力支持工农业生产大跃进，积极设法扩大1958年的进货和供应计划。进货额扩大一点一亿元，比原计划增加55.24％，进货品种增加七十八种。供应额扩大一点二亿元，比原计划增加68.8％，供应额增加的商品主要是农村兴修水利用的器材。为了协助工业部门提高产品质量，将设法搜集国内外先进产品的样品及资料供给工业部门研究，每季度还要举办一次质量评比展览会；同时派人深入农业社、水利工地、修配站等了解需要情况，指导工业生产，以便做到品种适销、规格对路、质价相称、供应及时。储运财会等部门要密切配合，使商品待运时间由1月份的九点二三天到4月份缩短为两天，由工厂直接调拨的商品要占全部发运商品的70％。全年资金周转次数要由原定的五点二四八次提高到七点二次，商品流转费用要比计划降低1.97％。商品保管方面要做到不锈损、不变质。保证各业务人员在一年内熟悉本科范围内各项工作，业务员保管员要作到熟悉所经营商品的物理性能、使用和保护的方法。
    这个站的职工们现在已经为实现这个倡议而行动起来了。储运部门的职工为了缩短商品待运时间，首先打破了夜间不发货的常规，调整劳动组织，改为昼夜发货。各仓库的保管员们也采取措施，保证货车一到就及时卸货。储运、财务会计、业务等部门密切配合，实行“均衡计划进销运”的工作方法。有关的科在办理进货、供应的手续时，已把过去流水作业式的作法改为齐头并进，保证由工厂当日进的货，能够做到当日收完、装箱、配车，发运出去。这样就大大缩短了商品待运时间，使资金周转的速度加快了。
