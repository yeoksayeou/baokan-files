Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 27th. Having just overcome the drought, peasants in North Vietnam are continuing to exert their efforts, launching an upsurge in spring agricultural production.

　　Almost all provinces have enthusiastically responded to the challenge from Xing'an Province, the province in North Vietnam that was most severely affected by the drought but did the best job in drought resistance and spring plowing, and are carrying out a "early spring cultivation" campaign. The requirements of the movement are: on the one hand, to carry out crash plowing, transplanting, and replanting of miscellaneous grains to ensure a certain cultivated area; on the other hand, to actively prepare for intensive cultivation to ensure a certain yield per unit area.

　　In order to strive to exceed the original production plan, twelve villages in Guangping Province mobilized nearly 6,000 people, including farmers, cadres, and military personnel, to transplant 38 mu of rice seedlings, plant more than 100 mu of miscellaneous grains, and apply thousands of loads of fertilizer in one day after the Spring Festival.

　　Around the Spring Festival, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party instructed all localities to plant large quantities of miscellaneous grains or early-maturing Nanning rice in areas severely affected by drought; areas less affected by drought or without drought should expand the rice planting area as much as possible, and try every means to increase the yield per unit area, ensuring that the production of miscellaneous grains is not reduced. Qinghua and other provinces that have not been affected by drought have guaranteed to the central government that they will overfulfill the task of cultivated area. In order to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has lent 130 tons of Nanning rice seedlings to farmers in various provinces to solve the current difficulty of lacking seedlings for farmers.

　　At present, the enthusiasm for production in most rural areas of North Vietnam indicates that a climax of spring agricultural production is about to arrive soon. According to relevant sources, the peasants' enthusiasm for production is inseparable from the results of the socialist education movement carried out among the peasants not long ago. The relevant departments in North Vietnam are planning to further strengthen this work.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 27th. The Vietnam National Farmers Liaison Committee recently issued a statement, accusing the South Vietnamese authorities of being indifferent to this year's drought, and of implementing measures such as lowering grain prices, conscripting laborers, and drafting soldiers after agricultural harvests have been greatly reduced, as well as persecuting former resistance personnel, which has greatly increased the suffering of the peasants.

　　The Vietnam National Farmers Liaison Committee cited materials from South Vietnamese newspapers pointing out that in the most prosperous south of South Vietnam, the autumn-planted rice harvest in 1957-1958 was almost only half of that of last year, and last year's harvest was already at a historically low level. The statement said that South Vietnam has rarely encountered this situation.

　　The statement said that since last autumn, Vietnam has suffered from drought throughout the country. Although North Vietnam is not as good as the south in terms of geographical and climatic conditions, North Vietnam has taken various active measures under the leadership of the Labor Party, the government, and President Ho Chi Minh to basically overcome the drought and ensure the sowing area of early crops. From this it can be seen that the main reason for the poor harvest in South Vietnam is not the drought, but the South Vietnamese regime's irresponsible attitude towards the drought.

　　The statement finally called on the people of South Vietnam to unite and help each other, produce and save themselves, and oppose the authorities' actions of searching for and purchasing rice and conscripting laborers and drafting soldiers.

### 越北农民掀起春季生产热潮  南越当局漠视灾情肆意迫害农民

    越北农民掀起春季生产热潮
    南越当局漠视灾情肆意迫害农民
    新华社河内27日电　刚刚战胜了旱灾的越南北方的农民，现在又继续鼓起干劲，掀起了一个春季农业生产的热潮。
    几乎所有省份都已经热烈响应越南北方旱情最严重而抗旱和春耕工作做得最好的兴安省的挑战，开展一个“初春耕作”运动。运动的要求是：一方面突击犁田、插秧、补种杂粮以保证一定的耕种面积；另一方面积极做好深耕细作的准备，以保证达到一定的单位面积产量。
    为了争取超过原订的生产计划，广平省十二个乡在春节以后的一天内就动员了农民、干部、部队人员等近六千人插了三十八亩秧，种了一百多亩杂粮，施了成千挑肥。
    越南劳动党中央在春节前后指示各地要在受旱严重地区大量种植杂粮或早熟的南宁稻；受旱较轻或无旱地区要尽量扩大水稻种植面积，并且想尽办法提高单位面积产量，保证一定不让杂粮减产。没有受旱的清化等省已经向中央保证要超额完成耕作面积的任务。为了贯彻党中央的指示，农林部已经贷给各省农民一百三十吨南宁稻秧苗，以解决农民目前缺乏秧苗的困难。
    目前，在越南北方大部分农村中出现的生产劲头预示一个春季农业生产的高潮不久就要到来。据有关人士指出，农民的生产劲头是同不久以前对农民进行的社会主义教育运动的成果分不开的。越南北方的有关部门正在计划进一步加强这项工作。
    新华社河内27日电　越南全国农民联络委员会最近发表声明，指责南越当局对今年的旱情漠不关心，并且在农业收成大大减少之后，还施行压低谷价，拉伕、抓壮丁等措施，还迫害前抗战人员，这大大增加了农民的痛苦。
    越南全国农民联络委员会引用南越报纸的材料指出，在南越最富饶的南部，1957—1958年度秋耕稻谷收成几乎只及去年度的一半，而去年度的收成已经是处在历史上很低的水平。声明说，南越历来是很少遇到这种情况的。
    声明说，去年秋季以来，越南全国受旱，尽管越南北部在地理和气候条件方面不如南部，但是，越南北部在劳动党、政府和胡志明主席领导下已经采取各种积极措施基本上克服了旱情，保证了早造的播种面积。从这里可以看出，南越歉收的主要原因并不是受旱，而是南越政权对旱情采取不负责任的态度。
    声明最后号召南越人民团结互助，生产自救，反对当局的搜购稻谷和拉伕抓壮丁等行为。
