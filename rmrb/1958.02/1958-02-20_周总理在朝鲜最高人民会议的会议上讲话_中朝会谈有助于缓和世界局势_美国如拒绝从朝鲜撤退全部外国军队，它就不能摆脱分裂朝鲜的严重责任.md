Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 19th. Premier Zhou Enlai delivered an important speech at the Second Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea this morning at the invitation of the Korean government.

At 9:20 a.m., Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, General Su Yu, and Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang, together with Korean Labor Party and Korean government leaders Kim Il-sung, Choi Yong-kun, Park Jung-ai, and others, arrived at the venue. At this time, the audience stood up, and a long and stormy burst of warm applause resounded throughout the hall.

Premier Zhou Enlai stepped onto the podium to deliver his speech, and the audience responded with thunderous applause.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: During our visit to our close neighbor, we held friendly and cordial talks with Premier Kim Il-sung and other leading comrades of the Republic's government. We are pleased to see that we share completely identical views on all the issues discussed. Based on the results of the talks, the government delegations of the two countries have just issued a joint statement. We believe that this meeting and the decisions made during it will not only further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, but will also help to promote the relaxation of tensions in the Far East and the world.

Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that assisting the Korean people in maintaining the armistice and achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea is a responsibility that the Chinese people should fulfill. He said: "One of the important tasks of the Chinese government delegation's visit to Korea this time is to consult with the Korean government on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, in order to promote the implementation of the various proposals put forward by the Korean government. After consultations with the Korean government, the Chinese government delegation proposed to the Chinese People's Volunteers that they voluntarily withdraw completely from Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers fully agreed with this proposal and decided to withdraw completely from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, with the first batch to be completed before April 30, 1958."

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Now, as the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has once again put forward fair and reasonable proposals for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided, upon the suggestion of the Chinese government, to voluntarily withdraw completely from Korea, the United States is facing an unavoidable obligation, which is to withdraw all of its troops and other foreign troops gathered and commanded by it from Korea in the same way. If the United States refuses to do so, it will never be able to escape the serious responsibility of dividing Korea." He said: "If the United States government and the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique lose their minds to such an extent that they regard the proactive measures taken by the Korean and Chinese sides as a sign of weakness and once again engage in adventurous activities in Korea, then what awaits them will be an even more tragic and shameful end. The forces in the world that maintain peace and prevent war have become unprecedentedly strong, and the Korean people, who have been tempered in the war against U.S. imperialist aggression and achieved great victory, are also more capable of destroying the enemy's re-invasion. The Chinese people, who have always been loyal to their internationalist obligations, will, if necessary in the future, fight side by side with the Korean people as in the past to defend the common interests of the two peoples. We solemnly remind the U.S. ruling clique: now is the time to make a wise choice."

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Everything we have seen during this visit makes us firmly believe that the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Labor Party and the Republic's government, will surely be able to victoriously complete the cause of building socialism and peacefully reunifying their motherland. Every achievement you have made in this great cause is also a victory for the Chinese people, and a victory for the entire socialist camp. In the struggle against the invaders, the Chinese people are comrades-in-arms fighting side by side with you. In socialist construction, the Chinese people are brothers advancing shoulder to shoulder with you. No force can hinder our common socialist cause and peace cause from advancing triumphantly. No force can undermine the great and immortal friendship between our two peoples."

Speaking of his impressions of visiting Korea, Premier Zhou Enlai said: In the units we have visited, we have seen the Korean people's high degree of patriotism and heroic spirit in overcoming difficulties. Their discipline and revolutionary vigor have left us with an extremely deep impression. These noble qualities shown by the Korean people in the war and in peaceful labor have set a very good example for us.

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, which lasted an hour and a half and was delivered on behalf of 600 million Chinese people, attracted great attention from the attendees. Every passage of his speech was greeted with sustained and warm applause. When he finished speaking, the audience once again stood up and gave him a long and enthusiastic applause. Premier Kim Il-sung also shook hands firmly with Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing his deep gratitude to him.

Choi Won-taek, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, delivered a speech at the beginning of the meeting, expressing a warm welcome on behalf of all the deputies to Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government delegation he led. He said that the Chinese people have consistently assisted the Korean people during the Fatherland Liberation War and post-war period, and have made every effort to safeguard peace in Korea and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. He said, in the joint statement signed today by the government delegations of the two countries, the government of the People’ s Republic of China has once again stated its firm and unwavering position to continue to make sincere efforts to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. We, along with all the Korean people, fully support and warmly welcome all the measures taken by the People's Republic of China this time to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. He said that the Korean people believe that the friendship and solidarity between Korea and China are incomparably precious, and will continue to make all efforts to consolidate and develop this friendship and solidarity. Then, he invited Premier Zhou Enlai to speak.

    周总理在朝鲜最高人民会议的会议上讲话
    中朝会谈有助于缓和世界局势
    美国如拒绝从朝鲜撤退全部外国军队，它就不能摆脱分裂朝鲜的严重责任
    新华社平壤19日电　周恩来总理今天上午应邀在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第二次会议上发表了重要讲话。
    上午九时二十分，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长、张闻天副部长、粟裕大将和乔晓光大使，同朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府的领导人金日成、崔庸健、朴正爱等一起来到会场。这时，全场起立，会场上响起了长时间的暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    周恩来总理走上讲台发表讲话，全场报以春雷般的掌声。
    周恩来总理说：在访问我们亲密邻邦的期间，我们同金日成首相和共和国政府的其他领导同志举行了友好亲切的会谈。我们高兴地看到，在所有谈到的问题上，我们之间的看法都是完全一致的。根据会谈结果，两国政府代表团刚才发表了联合声明。我们相信，这次会谈和会谈中所作的决定，不但会使我们两国间的友好和合作关系得到更进一步的发展，而且定将有助于促进远东和世界的紧张局势的和缓。
    周恩来总理强调说，协助朝鲜人民维护停战、实现朝鲜的和平统一，是中国人民应尽的责任。他说：“中国政府代表团这次来到朝鲜进行访问的重要任务之一，也就是同朝鲜政府协商有关中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出的问题，以便促使朝鲜政府提出的各项建议得到实现。经过同朝鲜政府协商以后，中国政府代表团向中国人民志愿军提出了主动地全部撤出朝鲜的建议。中国人民志愿军完全同意这个建议，并且决定在1958年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批将在1958年4月30日以前撤完。”
    周恩来总理说：“现在，当朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次提出关于和平解决朝鲜问题的公平合理的建议，中国人民志愿军就根据中国政府的建议决定主动地全部撤出朝鲜的时候，美国正面临着一个无法逃避的义务，那就是同样地把它的军队和由它纠集起来并且受它统一指挥的其他外国军队全部撤出朝鲜。如果美国拒绝这样做，它将永远不能摆脱分裂朝鲜的严重责任。”他说：“如果美国政府和南朝鲜李承晚集团丧失理智到了如此的程度，竟然把朝中方面的主动措施看作是软弱的表现，再一次在朝鲜干出冒险的勾当，那么，等待着它们的将是更加悲惨、更加可耻的下场。世界上维护和平和制止战争的力量已经空前强大，在反抗美帝国主义略侵的战争中经过锻炼并且取得伟大胜利的朝鲜人民也更有能力摧毁敌人的再一次进犯。始终忠于自己的国际主义义务的中国人民，今后只要有必要，还会同过去一样奋不顾身地同朝鲜人民一起为保卫两国人民的共同利益而战斗。我们郑重地提醒美国统治集团：现在是应该作出明智的抉择的时候了。”
    周恩来总理说：“我们在这次访问中所看到的一切使我们深信，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，一定能够胜利地完成建设社会主义和和平统一祖国的事业。你们在这个伟大的事业中所取得的每一项成就，也就是中国人民的胜利，也就是整个社会主义阵营的胜利。在反抗侵略者的斗争中，中国人民是同你们并肩作战的战友。在社会主义建设中，中国人民是同你们并肩前进的兄弟。没有任何力量能够阻挠我们共同的社会主义事业和和平事业乘风破浪地向前发展。没有任何力量能够破坏我们两国人民伟大的和不朽的友谊。”
    谈到访问朝鲜印象时，周恩来总理说：在我们所参观过的单位中，我们都看到了朝鲜人民那种高度的爱国主义精神和勇于克服困难的英雄气概。他们的纪律性和革命干劲，给我们留下了极为深刻的印象。朝鲜人民在战争中和和平劳动中所表现出来的这些高贵品质，给我们树立了很好的榜样。
    周恩来总理代表六亿中国人民发表的这篇长达一小时半的讲话，引起了到会者的极大注意。他的每一段话都博得了持久不息的热烈掌声。当他讲话结束的时候，全场再次起立，报以长时间的热烈掌声。金日成首相并且同周恩来总理紧紧握手，向他表示深深的谢意。
    朝鲜最高人民会议议长崔元泽在会议开始时致词，代表全体议员表示热烈欢迎周恩来总理和他率领的中国政府代表团。他说，中国人民在朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争时期和战后时期，始终一贯地援助了我们，并且为维护朝鲜的和平和促进朝鲜的和平统一作出了不惜一切的努力。他说，在两国政府代表团在今天签署的联合声明中，中华人民共和国政府再一次表明它为促进朝鲜的和平统一将继续作出真挚努力的坚定不移的立场。我们同全体朝鲜人民一起，全面支持和热烈欢迎中华人民共和国这次为和平解决朝鲜问题而采取的一切措施。他说，朝鲜人民认为，朝中两国的友谊团结是无比宝贵的，并且将为巩固和发展这种友谊团结而继续不断地进行一切的努力。接着，他邀请周恩来总理讲话。
    参加今天的会议的还有，朝鲜内阁副首相金一、洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、朴义琓、郑准泽，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长金昌满，劳动党中央委员会常务委员会委员金光侠、林海，最高人民会议副议长李箕永、金昌俊，最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长玄七锺、李克鲁、金元凤等。
    到会的还有朝鲜各界著名人士和各国驻朝鲜的外交使节。
