Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: According to TASS, Berlin, February 21st: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement supporting the statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5th, the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on February 7th, and the joint statement issued by the Chinese and North Korean governments on February 19th, which aimed at easing tensions in the Far East and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

The statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted with satisfaction that the Chinese and North Korean governments supported the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and fully supported the position of the German Democratic Republic on the peaceful reunification of Germany. The Government of the German Democratic Republic resolutely condemned the conspiracies of the U.S. government and the South Korean authorities to undermine the armistice agreement and turn South Korea into a base for atomic weapons. At the same time, it also saw the aggressive intentions manifested by the U.S. and West German imperialist groups in establishing atomic weapon and rocket weapon bases in West Germany.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic emphasized in the statement that the peace-loving steps taken by the Chinese and North Korean governments are also in the interests of the German people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 21st: Bonn dispatch: A news bulletin of the West German Social Democratic Party commented on February 20th on the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from North Korea this year, saying that this would put the United States "in an awkward position." The commentary stated: Now, "refusing China's and North Korea's proposals for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the holding of free elections under international supervision would put the United States in a more disadvantageous position than embarrassment. The United States would be seen by the entire Asian world as the prolonger of the division of Korea and the instigator of crusades."

Our newspaper comprehensively reports that according to Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet "Pravda" and newspapers of people's democratic countries published commentaries welcoming the joint statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments.

The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on February 22nd entitled "An Important Step in Consolidating Peace in the Far East."

The article pointed out that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from northern Korea proves the sincerity of the Chinese and North Korean sides in their desire to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful means. Now it is up to the United States and other countries with troops in South Korea to show their sincerity. If they sincerely hope to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and consolidate peace in the Far East, why can't they support the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China? Now is the time for a serious test of the true intentions of the United States and other countries participating in the occupation of South Korea. If they are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, then they should also withdraw all their troops from Korea. Otherwise, the world will be even more convinced that they are consistently obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea.

"Pravda" concluded that there is no doubt that the initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, aimed at a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, will be strongly supported by the people of Asian and European countries. The people of the world are awaiting concrete actions by the United States and other countries with troops in South Korea that will lead to the consolidation of peace in the Far East.

The Mongolian "Truth Daily" commented on February 22nd that the joint statement of China and North Korea once again proves the sincere desire of the two governments to resolve international issues through peaceful consultation and to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world. If the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea truly value peace, they should follow the example of the People's Republic of China and take steps to withdraw their troops from South Korea in the near future.

The Albanian "Unity Daily" published a commentary on February 21st, saying that the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to voluntarily withdraw from Korea not only helps to resolve the Korean issue but also helps to ease tensions in the Far East and the world, and helps to consolidate world peace. The commentary pointed out that China and North Korea have made continuous efforts for the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States and Syngman Rhee have continued to deepen their colonial rule over South Korea, attempting to turn it into a missile base. The commentary concluded that the peace-loving and brave Chinese and North Korean people will never allow the American imperialists to infringe upon and insult their fate.

An article in the Bulgarian "Labor Daily" pointed out that the people of all countries have once again seen from the joint statement of China and North Korea that the countries of the socialist camp are sincerely implementing a peace-loving policy. China's withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea once again proves its peace-loving policy. The American rulers, who often talk about peace, are now facing a serious test—either they withdraw their troops from South Korea, or they once again expose themselves as incorrigible hypocrites and warmongers.

The Czechoslovak "Red Right Daily," in discussing the warm response of newspapers around the world to the joint statement of China and North Korea and the reactions in the West to the decision to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote: The United States is facing a test today not only in Europe but also in the Far East. In this test, they must prove with actions, not words, that they are truly concerned about maintaining peace.

The Polish "Voice of Labor" wrote that the joint statement of China and North Korea proves that the governments of China and North Korea are not only verbally but also practically willing to make Korea unified, which makes it more difficult for Syngman Rhee to play tricks. The decision of the Chinese and North Korean governments will ease the tension in this region. The commentary pointed out that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea demonstrates the good will of socialist countries to jointly seek solutions to international issues through consultation.

    中朝两国为和平作出光辉榜样
    美国拒绝撤军就逃不了分裂朝鲜的罪名
    民主德国政府和各国舆论支持中朝声明
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社柏林21日讯：德意志民主共和国外交部发表声明，支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日的声明，中华人民共和国政府2月7日的声明和朝中两国政府2月19日发表的目的在于缓和远东紧张局势和和平解决朝鲜问题的联合声明。
    外交部的声明说，外交部满意地指出，中朝两国政府支持在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议和完全支持德意志民主共和国在和平统一德国问题上的立场。德意志民主共和国政府坚决斥责美国政府和南朝鲜当局企图破坏停战协定、变南朝鲜为原子武器基地的阴谋。同时它也看到了美国和西德帝国主义集团在西德建立原子武器和火箭武器基地方面所表现出来的侵略意图。
    德意志民主共和国外交部在声明中强调指出，朝中两国政府所采取的爱好和平的步骤也符合德国人民的利益。
    据新华社柏林21日电　波恩消息：西德社会民主党新闻公报20日评论中国志愿军将在今年全部撤出朝鲜一事说，这将使美国“陷于窘境”。评论说：现在“拒绝中国和北朝鲜撤退一切外国军队和在国际监督下举行自由选举的建议就会给美国带来比受窘更加不利的处境，美国将在整个亚洲世界的面前被看成是朝鲜分裂的延长者和十字军的怂恿者”。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联“真理报”和人民民主国家报纸发表评论，欢迎中朝两国政府的联合声明。
    苏联“真理报”22日以“巩固远东和平的重要步骤”为题发表了编辑部文章。
    文章指出，中国人民志愿军由朝鲜北部撤退，证明朝中方面渴望通过和平的途径解决朝鲜问题的诚意。现在要看美国和在南朝鲜拥有军队的其他国家有无诚意了。如果它们真诚希望促进朝鲜的和平统一和巩固远东和平，它们为什么不能支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的建议呢？现在是美国以及参加侵占南朝鲜的其他国家的真正意图受到严正考验的时候了。如果它们关心朝鲜问题的和平解决，那么它们就应该也从朝鲜撤退自己的一切军队。否则，全世界就会更加确信，正是它们在一贯阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。
    “真理报”最后说，毫无疑问，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的旨在和平解决朝鲜问题的倡议一定会得到亚洲和欧洲各国人民的有力支持。全世界人民都在期待着美国和在南朝鲜拥有军队的其他国家采取导致巩固远东和平的具体行动。
    蒙古“真理报”22日评论说，中朝两国联合声明再一次证明了两国政府的和平协商解决国际问题和巩固远东和世界和平的真诚愿望。美国和其他在南朝鲜驻有军队的国家如果真正重视和平，就应当以中华人民共和国为榜样，在最近时期内采取步骤，从南朝鲜撤出军队。
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”21日发表评论说，中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的决定不仅有助于朝鲜问题的解决，并且有助于缓和远东和世界紧张局势，有助于巩固世界和平。评论指出，中朝两国对和平统一朝鲜曾经不断地作出了努力。但是，美国和李承晚却不断地加深对南朝鲜的殖民统治，企图把它变为导弹基地。评论最后说，爱好和平的和勇敢的中朝人民是决不容许美国帝国主义者侵害和侮辱他们的命运的。
    保加利亚“劳动报”的文章指出，各国人民从中朝联合声明中又一次看到了社会主义阵营各国是诚心诚意地执行爱好和平的政策的。中国从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军这一行动，再次证明了它的爱好和平的政策。经常高谈和平的美国统治者现在面临着严重的考验——他们或者是从南朝鲜撤出自己的军队，或者是再一次暴露出他们是不堪救药的伪君子和战争狂人。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在谈到全世界报纸对中朝联合声明的热烈响应以及撤退中国人民志愿军的决定在西方所引起的反应时写道：美国今天不仅仅在欧洲而且也在远东面临着考验。在这个考验中，他们必须以行动而不是言词来证明他们真正关心维护和平。
    波兰“劳动之声报”写道，中朝联合声明证明中朝两国政府不仅在口头上、而且用实际行动表明愿意使朝鲜获得统一，这使李承晚玩弄手法更加困难。中朝两国政府的决定将使这个地区的紧张局势得到缓和。评论指出，中国人民志愿军的撤出朝鲜，表明了社会主义各国共同寻求用协商办法解决国际问题的善良愿望。
