Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 21st: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a national large-scale rolling steel conference in Chongqing, which determined that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, various special-shaped steel products not currently produced in China should be trial-produced in large quantities to expand the variety of large-scale steel products in China.

According to the conference's decisions, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, large-scale rolling steel plants in China will trial-produce various steel piles, large-sized I-beams, 310 Z-shaped steel, heavy steel rails, high-carbon and medium-manganese steel rails, 25-meter heavy rails, and various high-strength low-alloy steel products. At the same time, in order to save a large amount of metal, it was also decided to gradually replace ordinary I-beams with new thin-walled I-beams, and to successively trial-produce other thin-walled steel products.

This national large-scale rolling steel conference also made corresponding decisions and proposed 29 important measures and specific methods to further adopt new technologies, improve product quality, improve equipment, and tap potential to further increase production. During the conference, advanced experiences from various large-scale rolling steel plants across the country over the past few years were also exchanged.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the Angang Large-Scale Rolling Steel Plant and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Large-Scale Rolling Steel Workshop made significant contributions to the trial production of new products. Within five years, the number of new large-scale steel products increased by 55, including important ones such as 38 kg steel rails, 43 kg steel rails, 50 kg steel rails, No. 45 I-beams, No. 24 thin-walled I-beams, tractor tracks, and crane rails.

    试制大批异形钢材
    据新华社重庆21日电冶金工业部最近在重庆召开的全国大型轧钢会议确定，第二个五年计划期内要大批试制目前我国尚未生产的各种异形钢材，扩大我国大型钢材品种。
    根据会议确定，我国各大型轧钢厂在第二个五年计划期间将试制各种钢桩、大号工字钢、三一○乙字钢、重型钢轨、高炭及中锰钢轨、二五公尺重轨、以及各种高强度的低合金钢材。同时为了大量节约金属，还决定逐步用新薄壁工字钢代替一般工字钢，并陆续试制其他薄壁钢材。
    这次全国大型轧钢会议，对进一步采用新技术，提高产品质量，改进设备，挖掘潜力，以进一步提高产量的问题，也作出了相应的决定，提出了二十九项重要措施和具体办法。会议期间还交流了全国各大型轧钢厂几年来的先进经验。
    在第一个五年计划期间，鞍钢大型轧钢厂和重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间在试制新产品工作上作出了重大的贡献。五年内大型钢材新产品增加了五十五种，其中重要的有三十八公斤钢轨，四十三公斤钢轨、五十公斤钢轨、四十五号工字钢、二十四号薄壁工字钢、拖拉机履带和吊车轨等。
