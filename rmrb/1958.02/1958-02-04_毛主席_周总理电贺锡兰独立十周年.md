    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Ceylon's independence, I extend my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency and the people of Ceylon on behalf of the Chinese people and in my own name.

Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd: Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to Ceylon's Prime Minister, Mr. Bandaranaike, on the 3rd, congratulating him on the tenth anniversary of Ceylon's independence. The telegram reads as follows:

    To His Excellency Prime Minister Bandaranaike:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Ceylon's independence, I extend my warm congratulations to the Government of Ceylon and to Your Excellency on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and in my own name.

    We are pleased to see that over the past ten years, the people and government of Ceylon have achieved great success in safeguarding national independence and building their own country. The people and government of Ceylon, together with Asian and African countries, have also made increasingly important contributions to promoting friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries and defending world peace.

    Since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ceylon, the traditional friendship between the two countries has seen new development. The economic, trade, and cultural relations between the two countries have also been further strengthened. I wish that this friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Ceylon will be increasingly enhanced on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This not only conforms to the vital interests of the people of China and Ceylon, but also contributes to maintaining world peace and promoting the easing of international tensions.

                      Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai
                                    February 3, 1958, in Beijing
