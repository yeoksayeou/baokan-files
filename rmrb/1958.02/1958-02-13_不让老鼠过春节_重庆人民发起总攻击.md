Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th. “Don't let the rats celebrate the Spring Festival!” This is the resounding slogan put forward by Chongqing City, determined to fight hard for seven days and nights before the Spring Festival to basically eliminate rats in the urban area.

On the morning of the 11th, a 5,000-person oath-taking mobilization meeting was held in the central area of ​​Chongqing City, deciding to launch a general attack on rats. Starting from the 11th, every household and every unit would completely cut off the rats' food supply and starve the rats for three days, then place medicated bait to poison and kill them; and use sulfur to fumigate the rats in the main ditches, driving them out of their burrows for capture and extermination, striving to completely eliminate the rats in the urban area within seven days. On the afternoon of the 11th, neighborhood offices in the urban area held residents' meetings to convey the spirit of the oath-taking mobilization meeting. On the 11th, every household would begin cutting off the rats' food supply and engaging in rat-catching activities.

After criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking recently, many districts and units in Chongqing City have greatly shortened the originally planned timeframe for eliminating the four pests with revolutionary heroic spirit, striving to turn Chongqing, a mountain city with many rats, mosquitoes, and flies, into a "four-free" city in the shortest possible time. Chongqing urban area decided to strive to become a "four-free" area within a little over a month, which is one year and two months ahead of the plan to eliminate the four pests within a year and a half that was decided just half a month ago.

    不让老鼠过春节
    重庆人民发起总攻击
    新华社重庆12日电  “不留老鼠过春节！”这是重庆市提出要在春节前苦战七天七夜，一定把城区老鼠基本消灭掉的响亮口号。
    11日上午重庆市中心区召开了五千人的誓师动员大会，决定对老鼠发动总攻击，从11日开始每户人家每个单位完全断绝鼠粮，饿鼠三日，然后安放药饵毒杀；并在主要沟道采用硫磺熏鼠，驱出洞外捕杀，争取七天之内全部歼灭城区的老鼠。11日下午城区各街道办事处都召开居民会议，传达誓师动员大会精神，11日各家各户都将开始断绝鼠粮和进行捕鼠活动。
    重庆市许多地区、单位在最近批判右倾保守思想以后，纷纷以革命英雄气概，把原订除四害规划的时间大大缩短，争取在最短期间内把老鼠、蚊子、苍蝇较多的山城重庆变为“四无”城市。重庆城区决定争取在一个多月以内成为“四无”地区，这比半个月前才决定的一年半内消灭四害的规划提前了一年零二个多月。
