Comrades, friends!

Today, we are here to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the great Soviet Army. The Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all peace-loving people in the world join the Soviet people and the Soviet Army in joyfully celebrating this festival. Please allow me, on behalf of all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to extend our cordial and fraternal congratulations to the heroic and powerful Soviet Army of our great ally!

The Soviet Army was born in the flames of the great October Socialist Revolution and grew strong in the heroic and arduous battles against enemies at home and abroad. Forty years ago, the establishment of the first socialist country in human history caused great panic among world imperialism. At that time, they organized the armies of fourteen capitalist countries to carry out armed intervention and incited the armed rebellion of the White Guards, attempting to strangle this newborn force. In order to defend the achievements of the October Revolution and effectively defend the socialist motherland, the Bolshevik Party, headed by the great Lenin, created the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on the basis of the Workers' Red Guards. From the moment it was born, this army plunged into heroic battles, shouldering the sacred task of defending the Soviet regime. Under the correct leadership of the Party and with the support of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, this young Soviet Red Army, after three years of arduous and heroic war, finally smashed foreign aggression and domestic armed rebellion, defending the security of the Soviet state. During the Second World War, the Hitler fascist army launched an unprecedented war of aggression against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Army, under the teachings and encouragement of the great Soviet Communist Party, demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, displayed unparalleled courage and infinite wisdom, and achieved a brilliant victory in the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet Army annihilated the main forces of the German and Japanese imperialist armies, liberated Eastern European countries, Northeast China, and North Korea from fascist enslavement, and saved human civilization. In the post-war years, the Soviet Army has been further strengthened on the basis of the new upsurge in the Soviet national economy and the significant achievements in industrial and agricultural production and science and technology. Because Soviet science and technology are far ahead of the world, today's Soviet Army has the most modern technical equipment in the world, including thermonuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. The incomparably powerful Soviet Army is a strong pillar for defending world peace and human security, and for defending the cause of socialism, and is a loyal friend of all oppressed people and peace-loving people. Therefore, every major achievement of the Soviet Army in its construction brings new strength to the cause of human progress and fills the working people of the whole world with joy and inspiration.

The Soviet people and the Chinese people have a long and deep friendship. During the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Chinese people were opposing imperialism and feudal forces, the Soviet people gave fraternal assistance to our country's revolutionary struggle and just cause. In the later stages of the Second World War, the victory of the Soviet Army in annihilating the Japanese Kwantung Army in Northeast China played a significant role in the Chinese people's victory over the Japanese aggressors. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people and the army provided multifaceted fraternal assistance to our country's national defense construction and army building. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will never forget this great assistance from the Soviet people and the army! Here, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the great Soviet people, the great Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the army.

Soviet Army Building Experience

Comrades! The Soviet Army is the first people's army built under the leadership of the Communist Party, a new type of revolutionary army that has never existed in history. How to build such an army, there was no ready-made experience forty years ago. As Lenin said: "The problem of the Red Army's construction is entirely a new problem, and it has never even been raised in theory." At that time, the Soviet Communist Party, led by the great Lenin, correctly carried out the construction of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army with a revolutionary spirit in the arduous war against enemies at home and abroad. The Soviet Army followed some fundamental principles of people's army building formulated by Lenin and established a new type of army that was completely different from the old armies of the exploiting classes. Over the past forty years, the Soviet Communist Party has accumulated a wealth of experience in applying Marxist-Leninist theory to solve the problems of army building. This experience is of universal significance to the military construction of all socialist countries.

A basic experience of Soviet army building is that the army must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party. When Lenin and the Bolshevik Party created the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, they clearly stipulated this principle and took a series of major measures to strengthen the Party's leadership over the army. The most important of these was the establishment of Party organizations in the army, the establishment of political work and the system of political commissars. The resolution drafted by Lenin and passed by the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party in 1918 stated: "The policy of the military organs, like all other organs and institutions, should be implemented on the precise basis of the general instructions issued by the Party through its Central Committee, and under the direct supervision of the Party Central Committee." When discussing political work in the Red Army, Lenin said: "Where the most attention is paid to military political work and the work of political commissars,... there is no slackness in the army, the order and morale of the army are better, and there are more victories." The history of the Soviet Army's victorious development proves that the Party is the organizer and leader of the army, and all victories achieved by the army are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party. Without the Party, the army will lose its political direction and suffer defeat. Therefore, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against even the slightest tendency to deviate from the Party's leadership, in order to guarantee the absolute leadership of the Communist Party over the army and guarantee the victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The resolution of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in October 1957 on improving Party and political work in the Soviet Army and Navy once again clarified the importance of the Party's leadership and political work. This resolution criticized the anti-Party elements who violated Lenin's principles of army building, consolidated the system of political work in the army, and consolidated the Party's absolute leadership over the army. This resolution is of great educational significance not only for the Soviet Army, but also for our army and the armies of all socialist countries.

Another basic experience of Soviet army building is that the army must maintain close ties with the masses of the people. In an article on whether the Bolsheviks could retain state power, Lenin said, referring to the relationship between the Red Army and the people: "This armed force is not isolated from the people like the old standing army, but is most closely connected with the people." The Soviet Army is powerful precisely because it comes from the people, is for the people, and relies on the people, and wholeheartedly serves the people. It is different from the armies of all exploiting classes. It is not a tool to oppress the people, but a tool to defend the revolutionary achievements of the people and to protect the socialist country from enemy invasion. In times of severe war and peaceful construction, the Soviet people of all nationalities have enthusiastically supported their army with selfless labor, with huge production achievements, and with the latest science and technology, so that the Soviet Army has been able to defeat all enemies in war, and also to continuously strengthen and improve its combat effectiveness in peacetime, becoming the most powerful modern revolutionary army.

Yet another basic experience of Soviet army building is the establishment of new officer-soldier relations and superior-subordinate relations within the army, which is a relationship of comradeship. Lenin said at the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets: "The old-style army, the army of barracks training and rampant whipping - is gone forever. It has been destroyed, it has been completely destroyed. Full democratization of the army has been implemented." When discussing Red Army discipline, Lenin also said: "The Red Army has established unprecedentedly solid discipline, which is not established with sticks, but relies on the consciousness, loyalty, and self-sacrifice of workers and peasants." These instructions of Lenin are the criteria for the Soviet Army and all people's armies to establish internal relations. It is also the basic guarantee that the Soviet Army can become a highly centralized army with conscious iron discipline. Because of this, the members of the Soviet Army have a high degree of consciousness, can treat their cause with the attitude of masters, are willing to contribute their lives for the interests of the people, can be brave and tenacious in battle, not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, and can give full play to a high degree of initiative and creativity in their work.

These basic experiences illustrate the source of the Soviet Army's invincible strength and point out the road to building all people's armies.

The Concretization of Soviet Army Building Experience in Our Army's Construction

The Soviet Army, built according to these experiences, is an example for the armies of all socialist countries. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong correctly applied the experience of the Soviet Union in building the Red Army under Chinese conditions and built the Chinese People's Liberation Army according to the example of the Soviet Army. Learning from the Soviet Union and learning from the Soviet Army has been the long-term and unwavering policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Comrades! Our army was established and developed under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. Based on Lenin's principles of army building and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong made detailed and brilliant expositions on the theoretical issues of the Chinese revolutionary war and our army's construction. Comrade Mao Zedong's writings on this aspect have always been the action guide and combat program for our army to carry out revolutionary war and army building. All comrades of our army must conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, understand his military thinking, and improve all aspects of work according to his instructions, strengthen national defense construction, improve the army's combat effectiveness, and better complete the glorious tasks assigned to the army by the Party and the state.

History has shown that our Party, using Lenin's principles of army building and the experience of the Soviet Army, has already made the Chinese People's Liberation Army an invincible army. The merits of this army in liberating our country and safeguarding the cause of peace in the Far East will be gloriously recorded in our country's history.

Taking advantage of the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, I would like to talk about how Lenin's principles of army building and the experience of the Soviet Army have been concretized in our army's construction under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.

I will discuss this in three aspects.

The Entire Army Obeys the Leadership of the Party Central Committee, and the Troops Stationed in Various Places Obey the Leadership and Supervision of the Local Party Committees Accordingly

First, in terms of the relationship between the army and the Party. The entire army must obey the leadership of the Party Central Committee, and must implement the Party Central Committee's political line, decisions, and instructions, so that the army becomes a model for faithfully implementing the Party's policies. The troops, organs, and schools stationed in various regions, while accepting the leadership and command of the military system, must also accept the leadership and supervision of the corresponding local Party committees.

In order to ensure the Party's leadership over the army, our army has long implemented a leadership work system that combines collective leadership of the Party committee with division of labor and responsibility by the chiefs. Experience has proved that this system is not only applicable to the initial stage of army development, but also completely applicable to the advanced stage of army development. The higher the degree of modernization of the army and the more complex the organization and establishment, the more important collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility become. The wisdom of any leader cannot be separated from the wisdom of the collective. The Party committee concentrates individual wisdom by collective discussion and research on major issues, while at the same time not monopolizing the specific business within the scope of the chief's authority. This can truly guarantee the centralized unity and coordinated action of the army's command on the basis of unified understanding and unified will.

In our army, both the military commander and the political commissar are the chiefs of the troops and the core of the Party committee's collective leadership. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, they are responsible for the division of labor in the work of the troops. Military work is organized and implemented by the military commander, and political work is organized and implemented by the political commissar. The implementation of this system makes it possible for us to closely combine military work and political work.

Our army's political work was also established by learning from the experience of the Soviet Army. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee at all levels, the political work organs carry out the army's political and ideological education, implement the Party Central Committee's political line and the state's policies and decrees, enlighten the political consciousness of all military personnel, consolidate unity inside and outside the army, improve the army's combat effectiveness, and ensure the completion of every glorious task. At present, the main content of our army's political work is to carry out in-depth socialist ideological education in the army according to the principle of combining theory and practice, overcome bourgeois individualism, and consolidate the Party's leadership over the army. Is a Combat Team and a Working Team

Second, in terms of the relationship between the army and the masses of the people. The Party Central Committee clearly stipulates that the Chinese People's Liberation Army must always be a combat team and at the same time a working team. In addition to undertaking the major task of defending the motherland, our army must also actively participate in and help the masses of the people in production and construction, disaster relief, and carry out cultural and health movements, and strengthen ties with the masses of the people in all aspects. In the army, we should continue to strengthen the education of supporting the government and cherishing the people, so that the military personnel cherish the interests of the masses of the people, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, respect the staff of the Party and government, maintain good mass discipline and a hard-working and simple lifestyle. Lenin once proposed: "To turn the Red Army, which is dominated by peasants, into a tool for educating peasants." This is of particular importance to our army. We should make the army a school for young soldiers, training them to become a vital force in defending the motherland and the production and construction front. At the same time, officers should also understand that when the motherland needs us to serve in the army, we should be happy to stay in the army, and when the motherland needs us to go up the mountains and down to the countryside to participate in production and construction, we should also be equally happy to return to production. The idea that there is no future in returning from the army to local labor is an extremely wrong idea of despising labor. The glorious people's army should never allow some comrades to embark on the dangerous road of separating from labor.

Unity Between Officers and Soldiers, Unity Between Superiors and Subordinates

Third, in terms of the internal relations of the army. Our army has long implemented the principle of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between superiors and subordinates. This means that officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, and those at the same level should respect each other, learn from each other, and compare work and progress with each other. In mutual exchanges, they should be sincere, tell the truth and not tell lies. There should be ideological exchanges and ideological struggles, mutual criticism and mutual supervision. For backward elements and comrades who make mistakes, they should be patiently persuaded and educated to help them make progress. The prestige of our army officers should mainly rely on adhering to the Party's principles and hard work, setting an example, learning modestly, strictly maintaining discipline, loving soldiers, loving subordinates, loving the people, standing firmly on the proletarian position, being energetic, not afraid of difficulties, and resolutely and bravely overcoming difficulties. The prestige established in this way is solid and reliable.

Our army's leadership relations and command relations should be a combination of high unity and centralization and high initiative and flexibility, opposing both decentralism and absolute centralism. All levels should, under unified leadership, combine the actual situation, give full play to high initiative and initiative, and flexibly and responsibly implement instructions and orders according to the overall intention. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Protracted War": "Failure to concentrate what should be concentrated is called dereliction of duty on the part of the superior and presumption on the part of the subordinate," "Failure to decentralize what should be decentralized is called monopolization on the part of the superior and lack of spontaneity on the part of the subordinate." These instructions still have important practical significance for us today.

All members of our army are politically equal and internally united. However, because there are different levels of political consciousness, there are correct and incorrect differences in understanding problems, and there are advanced and backward differences in work, there are also contradictions within the army. In order to correctly resolve these contradictions, it is necessary to adhere to the democratic system under centralized leadership in the army. Our army officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, and those at the same level are allowed to criticize and supervise each other from the desire for unity. Our army should also use the method of rectification, through large-scale airing of views, big debates, and socialist education, to examine and improve work and adjust internal relations. As long as the situation permits, all members should be mobilized to discuss how to complete combat, training, and other work tasks, absorb reasonable suggestions from the masses, turn the intentions of the leadership into the determination of the masses themselves, and further improve the leadership's plans. Experience has proved that troops that have correctly realized this kind of democratic life always have better work results, more harmonious internal relations, and problems that are easier to solve. The concentration and discipline of the troops will not be weakened, but will be more consolidated.

Our army establishes and maintains strict discipline, mainly through democratic and mass line methods, combining administrative orders with political and ideological work. Through education, all members are made to realize that the army's orders and discipline embody the common interests of the revolutionary cause, represent the will of the Party and the entire people, and consciously, voluntarily, resolutely obey and abide by them, not blindly obey. Discipline established solely by relying on administrative coercion, relying on commandism and punishmentism, is false and cannot withstand the test.

In short, our army's centralization and discipline are based on political consciousness and democracy. We want to achieve the goal of enhancing unity inside and outside the army, consolidating army discipline, and improving army combat effectiveness through democratic methods under centralized leadership. Any one-sided and inappropriate interpretation of the relationship between centralization and democracy is wrong.

Comrades! Over the past forty years, the face of the world has undergone fundamental changes. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has surpassed the imperialist camp in strength. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: Now the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. But as long as the imperialist countries have not launched an aggression against our socialist country, we will not cross our lines of defense. If they should launch an aggression against us, like fascist Hitler attacked the Soviet Union and the Japanese warlords attacked China, then we must resolutely crush this aggression, just as we crushed Hitler and the Japanese warlords in the Second World War. We are resolutely maintaining peace and opposing war. The great Soviet people are confidently engaged in magnificent communist construction. Under the leadership of the Party, our people are also drumming up revolutionary energy, riding the wind and waves, forging ahead bravely, and striving to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry and agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense in a faster, better, and more economical way. We firmly believe that the decadent capitalist system will inevitably give way to the emerging socialist system, and the future of our cause is infinitely bright. Today, standing together with the world's most powerful Soviet Army are the armies of all socialist countries, and this force is obviously invincible to any enemy. Anyone who wants to offend it will be smashed to pieces in front of it. However, the imperialists, who are addicted to aggression, are not reconciled to defeat, and they are still trying to prepare for a new world war. Modernized and fully armed imperialist troops are still standing at our country's doorstep, and our country's territory of Taiwan is yet to be liberated. Therefore, we must never lose our vigilance. The Chinese People's Liberation Army must be with the great Soviet Army, vigilantly defending peace in the Far East and the world!

Through the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, a very broad and very profound socialist revolution movement has formed on our country's political and ideological fronts. The whole country has already shown a new face. The army's rectification is an important part of the national rectification movement. Now it can be seen that after the rectification, the work of the entire army and the members of the entire army have made unprecedented progress. The army's construction is entering a new stage. Our current task is to persevere in the rectification movement to the end, completely eliminate official airs, eliminate stale air, eliminate arrogance, eliminate squeamishness, transform thinking, improve work, further enhance unity, promote the initiative and creativity of all officers and soldiers, consolidate the close ties between the army and the people, participate in productive labor, support national construction, overcome extravagance and waste, and implement building the army through diligence and thrift. We believe that all comrades of the Liberation Army will certainly be able to continue to carry forward the fine traditions of our army and perfectly realize the above-mentioned requirements put forward in the rectification movement. At the same time, we also believe that, in coordination with the new leap forward in our country's national economy, we will certainly be able to build our army into a modern and revolutionary army as excellent as the Soviet Army faster.

Comrades! On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, let us once again express that the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party will always be the most loyal comrade-in-arms of the great Soviet people and the Soviet Army. We will always fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people and the Soviet Army to defend world peace and the cause of human justice to the end.

Long live the heroic Soviet Army, the strong pillar of world peace!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live Marxism-Leninism!

Long live world peace!

    学习列宁建军原则  加强国防建设提高军队战斗力
    彭德怀元帅在首都庆祝苏联军队建军四十周年大会上的讲话同志们，朋友们！
    今天我们在这里热烈地庆祝伟大的苏联军队建军四十周年。中国人民、中国人民解放军和世界上一切爱好和平的人民同苏联人民和苏联军队在一起，欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个节日。请允许我代表中国人民解放军全体同志，向我们伟大盟邦的英勇强大的苏联军队，致以亲切的兄弟般的祝贺！
    苏联军队是在伟大的十月社会主义革命的烈火中诞生的，是在和国内外敌人进行英勇卓绝的战斗中成长壮大起来的。四十年前，人类历史上第一个社会主义国家的成立，引起了世界帝国主义的极大恐慌，当时他们曾经组织了十四个资本主义国家的军队进行武装干涉，并且挑起了白党的武装叛乱，企图扼杀这个新生的力量。为着保卫十月革命的成果，为着有效地保卫社会主义祖国，以伟大列宁为首的布尔什维克党，在工人赤卫队的基础上创建了工农红军。这支军队一开始诞生，就投入了英勇的战斗，担负起保卫苏维埃政权的神圣任务。这个年轻的苏联红军，在党的正确领导下，在苏联各族人民的支持下，经过三年艰苦的英勇的战争，终于粉碎了外国的侵略和国内的武装叛乱，捍卫了苏维埃国家的安全。第二次世界大战中，希特勒法西斯军队又向苏联发动了历史上空前规模的侵略战争。在伟大的苏联共产党教导和鼓舞下的苏军，表现了高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，发挥了无比的勇敢和无穷的智慧，取得了伟大卫国战争的光辉胜利。苏军消灭了德、日帝国主义军队的主力，把东欧各国、中国东北和朝鲜北部从法西斯的奴役下解放出来，拯救了人类的文明。在战后的年代里，苏军在苏联国民经济的新高涨，工农业生产和科学技术获得重大成就的基础上，进一步强大起来。由于苏联的科学技术远远走在世界的最前头，所以今天的苏军有着世界上最新式的技术装备，包括热核武器和洲际弹道导弹在内。无比强大的苏联军队，是保卫世界和平和人类安全、保卫社会主义事业的坚强支柱，是一切被压迫人民和爱好和平人民的忠实朋友。因此，苏军在建设上的每一个重大成就，都给人类进步事业带来新的力量，都为全世界劳动人民欢欣鼓舞。
    苏联人民和中国人民有着悠久的深厚的友谊。在中国人民反对帝国主义和封建势力的北伐战争时期和抗日战争时期，苏联人民都对我国的革命斗争和正义事业给予了兄弟般的援助。在第二次世界大战的后期，苏联军队在我国东北地区歼灭日本关东军的胜利，对我国人民战胜日本侵略者起了巨大的作用。在中华人民共和国建立以后，苏联人民和军队对于我国国防建设和军队建设提供了多方面的兄弟般的援助。中国人民和解放军对于苏联人民和军队这些伟大的援助将永志不忘！我在这里，要向伟大的苏联人民、向伟大的苏联共产党、苏联政府和军队致以诚恳的谢意。
    苏军建军经验
    同志们！苏联军队是第一支在共产党领导下建设起来的人民军队，是历史上从来没有过的新型的革命军队。如何建立这样的军队，在四十年前是没有现成经验的。正如列宁所说：“红军建设问题，完全是一个新问题，甚至在理论上从来没有被提出过”。在当时伟大的列宁所领导的苏联共产党在反对国内外敌人的艰苦战争中，用革命的精神正确地进行了工农红军的建设。苏军遵循着列宁制定的人民军队建设的一些根本原则，建立起来了一支同剥削阶级的旧军队截然不同的新型军队。四十年来，苏联共产党在运用马克思列宁主义理论解决军队建设问题方面，积累了很丰富的经验。这些经验，对于所有社会主义国家的军事建设，都有普遍的意义。
    苏军建设的一个基本经验，就是军队要置于共产党的绝对领导之下。列宁和布尔什维克党在创建工农红军的时候，就明确地规定了这个原则，并且采取了一系列重大的措施加强党对军队的领导。其中最主要的就是在军队中建立党的组织，建立政治工作和政治委员制度。俄共中央委员会在1918年通过的由列宁所起草的决议中说：“军事机关的政策，像所有其它机关和机构一样；应当在党通过它的中央委员会所颁发的总的指示的准确基础上，并在党中央的直接监督下实行”。在论到红军中的政治工作的时候，列宁说：“在最注意军队政治工作和政治委员工作的地方，……军队中就没有松懈现象，军队的秩序和士气就要好些，胜利也就多些”。苏军胜利发展的历史证明，党是军队的组织者，领导者，军队所取得的一切胜利都是和党的正确领导分不开的。离开了党，军队就会在政治上迷失方向而遭到失败。因此，必须和一切脱离党的领导的那怕是微小的倾向作坚决的斗争，以保证共产党对军队的绝对领导，保证社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利。1957年10月苏共中央全会关于改进苏联陆海军中党和政治工作的决议，再一次阐明了党的领导和政治工作的重要性。这个决议批判了违背列宁建军原则的反党分子，巩固了军队中的政治工作制度，巩固了党对军队的绝对领导。这个决议不仅对苏联军队，同时对我军和所有社会主义国家的军队，都有重大的教育意义。
    苏军建设的另一个基本经验，就是军队要同人民群众经常保持密切的联系。列宁在布尔什维克能否保持国家政权一文中，谈到红军和人民的关系时说：“这个武装力量不是像旧时常备军那样和人民隔离，而是和人民最密切地联系着的。”苏联军队之所以强有力，正是由于它是来自人民，为了人民和依靠人民的，是全心全意为人民服务的。它和一切剥削阶级的军队不同，它不是压迫人民的工具，而是保卫人民革命成果，保卫社会主义国家不受敌人侵犯的工具。苏联各族人民在严重的战争时期与和平建设时期，都以忘我的劳动，以巨大的生产成就，以最新的科学技术，热烈地支援自己的军队，从而使苏联军队能够在战争中战胜一切敌人，而且在和平时期也能不断地加强和提高自己的战斗力，成为最强大的现代化革命军队。
    苏军建设的又一个基本经验，就是在军队内部建立新的官兵关系和上下级的关系，这种关系就是同志的关系。列宁在第三届全俄苏维埃代表大会上说：“旧式的军队，兵营苦练的，鞭笞备至的军队——已经一去不复返了。它被破坏了，它被彻底地破坏了。军队的充分民主化已实行了。”在论到红军纪律的时候，列宁又说：“红军已经建立了空前巩固的纪律，它不是用棍棒建立起来的，而是依靠工人和农民的觉悟、忠诚和自我牺牲精神建立起来的。”列宁的这些指示，就是苏军和一切人民军队建立内部关系的准则。也是苏联军队能够成为一支高度集中和具有自觉的铁的纪律的军队的基本保证。正因为这样，苏军的成员就有高度的自觉性，能够以主人翁的态度对待自己的事业，愿意为人民的利益贡献出自己的生命，在战斗中能够英勇顽强不怕流血牺牲，在工作中能够发挥高度的积极性和创造精神。
    这些基本经验，说明了苏军战无不胜的力量源泉，指出了一切人民军队的建设道路。
    苏军建军经验在我军建设中的具体化
    根据这些经验建设起来的苏联军队，是一切社会主义国家军队的榜样。中国共产党和毛泽东同志，就是在中国的条件下正确地运用苏联建设红军的经验，按照苏军的榜样来建设中国人民解放军的。向苏联学习，向苏联军队学习，是中国共产党和中国人民解放军长期以来坚定不移的方针。
    同志们！我军是在毛泽东同志的直接领导下建立和发展起来的。毛泽东同志根据列宁的建军原则和中国革命战争的具体实践，对中国革命战争和我军建设的理论问题作了详尽的光辉的阐发。毛泽东同志关于这个方面的著作，一直就是我军进行革命战争和军队建设的行动指针和战斗纲领。我军全体同志必须认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，领会他的军事思想，并且根据他的指示，改进各方面的工作，加强国防建设，提高军队的战斗力，更好地完成党和国家给予军队的光荣任务。
    历史说明了，我党运用列宁的建军原则和苏军经验，业已使中国人民解放军成为无敌的军队。这支军队在解放我国和保卫远东和平事业中的功绩，将光荣地载入我国史册。
    趁着庆祝苏军建军四十周年的机会，我想谈一谈在毛泽东同志的直接领导下，列宁的建军原则和苏军经验在我军建设中是怎样具体化的。
    以下分三个方面来说。
    全军服从党中央的领导，各地驻军相应地服从地方党委的领导和监督
    第一，在军队和党的关系方面。全军要服从党中央的领导，对于党中央的政治路线、决定和指示，必须贯彻执行，从而使军队成为忠诚执行党的政策的模范。驻在各地区的部队、机关和学校，在接受军事系统的领导和指挥的同时，还要接受相应的地方党委的领导和监督。
    为着保证党对军队的领导，我军长期以来实行了党委集体领导和首长分工负责相结合的领导工作制度。经验证明，这一制度不但适用于军队发展的初级阶段，而且完全适用于军队发展的高级阶段。军队现代化程度越高，组织编制越是复杂，集体领导和分工负责，也越是显得重要。任何领导者的智慧都不能脱离集体的智慧。党委对重大问题，通过集体的讨论和研究，把个人的智慧集中起来，同时又不包办首长职权范围内的具体业务。这样就能在统一认识、统一意志的基础上，确实保证军队指挥上的集中统一和协同动作。
    在我们军队中军事指挥员和政治委员都是部队的首长，又是党委集体领导的核心。他们在党委的统一领导下，对部队工作分工负责。属于军事工作的，由军事指挥员组织执行，属于政治工作的，由政治委员组织执行。实行这种制度，就使我们有可能把军事工作和政治工作密切结合起来。
    我军的政治工作，也是学习苏军的经验建立起来的。政治工作机关在各级党委的统一领导下进行军队的政治思想教育工作，贯彻执行党中央的政治路线和国家的政策、法令，启发全体军人的政治觉悟，巩固军队内外团结，提高军队战斗力，保证完成每一个光荣的任务。当前我军政治工作的主要内容，是要根据理论和实际相结合的原则，对军队进行深入的社会主义思想教育，克服资产阶级个人主义思想，巩固党对军队的领导。是战斗队，又是工作队
    第二，在军队和人民群众的关系方面。党中央明确规定，中国人民解放军必须永远是战斗队，同时又是工作队。我军现在除了担负保卫祖国的重大任务以外，还要积极地参加和帮助人民群众的生产建设，救灾抢险，开展文化卫生运动，从各方面加强与人民群众的联系。在军队中我们应当继续加强拥政爱民教育，使得军人爱护人民群众利益，虚心听取群众意见，尊重党和政府的工作人员，保持良好的群众纪律和艰苦朴素的生活作风。列宁曾经提出过：“把农民占多数的红军，变成教育农民的工具”。这对我军说来具有特别的重要性。我们应当使军队成为青年士兵的学校，把他们训练成为保卫祖国和生产建设战线上的生力军。同时军官也应当懂得，当祖国需要我们在军队服务的时候，就应当愉快地留在军队，当祖国需要我们上山下乡参加生产建设的时候，也应当同样愉快地回到生产中去。认为从军队回到地方劳动没有前途的说法，是一种轻视劳动的极端错误的思想。光荣的人民军队决不应该让某些同志走上脱离劳动的危险道路。
    官兵一致，上下一致
    第三，在军队的内部关系方面。我军长期以来实行了官兵一致和上下一致的原则。这就是说，官兵之间，上下级之间，同级之间，应当互相尊重，互相学习，互相比工作，比进步。在相互来往中，应当态度诚恳，讲真话不讲假话。有思想交锋和思想斗争，相互批评和相互监督。对于落后分子和犯错误的同志，应当耐心说服教育，帮助他们进步。我军军官的威信，主要应当依靠坚持党的原则和艰苦的工作，以身作则、虚心学习，严格维护纪律，爱士兵，爱部属，爱人民，站稳无产阶级的立场，朝气蓬勃，不怕困难，坚决勇敢地克服困难。这样建立起来的威信，才是牢固可靠的。
    我军的领导关系和指挥关系，应当是高度的统一集中和高度的积极性灵活性的结合，既反对分散主义，又反对绝对集中主义。各级都应当在统一的领导下，依据总的意图，结合实际情况，发挥高度的积极性和主动性，灵活地负责地执行指示和命令。毛泽东同志在抗日游击战争的战略问题一书中说：“应该集中的不集中，在上者叫做失职，在下者叫做专擅”，“应该分散的不分散，在上者叫做包办，在下者叫做无自动性”。这些指示直到现在对于我们仍然具有重要的现实意义。
    我军的全体成员在政治上是平等的，内部是团结一致的。但是因为政治觉悟有高低的不同，对问题的认识有正确与错误的区别，工作上有先进与落后的差异，因此军队内部同时也存在着矛盾。为着正确地解决这些矛盾，在军队中就有必要坚持集中领导下的民主制度。我军官兵之间、上下级和同级之间，允许从团结愿望出发的相互批评，相互监督。我军同样应该用整风的方法，通过大鸣大放大辩论，进行社会主义教育，检查和改进工作，调整内部关系。只要情况许可，就应当发动全体成员对于如何完成作战、训练和其他工作任务进行讨论，吸收群众的合理建议，使领导的意图变成群众自己的决心，使领导上的计划进一步得到完善。经验证明，凡是正确地实现了这种民主生活的部队，工作成绩总是比较优异的，内部关系总是比较融洽的，发生了问题也比较容易得到解决。部队的集中和纪律不但不会削弱，反而更加巩固。
    我军建立和维护严格的纪律，主要是通过民主和群众路线的方法，把行政命令和政治思想工作结合起来。通过教育使全体成员认识到军队的命令和纪律体现着革命事业的共同利益，代表着党和全体人民的意志，自觉自愿地坚决地服从和遵守，绝不是盲目的服从。单纯依靠行政强制方法，依靠命令主义和惩办主义建立起来的纪律，是虚假的，经不起考验的。
    总之，我军的集中和纪律，是建立在政治自觉和民主的基础上。我们是要在集中领导下，通过民主的方法，达到增强军队内外团结、巩固军队纪律和提高军队战斗力的目的。对集中和民主的关系作任何片面的不恰当的解释都是错误的。
    同志们！四十年来，世界的面貌起了根本的变化。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在力量上已经超过了帝国主义阵营。正如毛泽东同志所说：现在是东风压倒西风。但是我们对于帝国主义国家，只要他们对于我们社会主义国家尚未进行侵略，我们是不会越出我们的防线的。如果他们竟然向我们进行侵略，如像法西斯希特勒进攻苏联，日本军阀进攻中国那样，那我们就一定要坚决地粉碎这种进攻，就像在第二次世界大战中粉碎希特勒和日本军阀那样。我们是坚决地维护和平反对战争的。伟大的苏联人民正在满怀信心地从事着宏伟的共产主义建设。我国人民在党的领导下，也正在鼓足革命干劲，乘风破浪，奋勇前进，争取多、快、好、省地把我国建成为一个具有现代工农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的社会主义国家。我们深信，腐朽的资本主义制度必将让位给新兴的社会主义制度，我们事业的前途是无限光明的。今天和世界上最强大的苏联军队站在一起的，还有各社会主义国家的军队，这个力量显然是任何敌人所不能战胜的。谁想触犯它，谁就会在它面前碰得粉碎。但是，侵略成性的帝国主义，并没有甘心服输，他们仍然在处心积虑的准备新的世界战争。在我国的门口仍然站着现代化全副武装的帝国主义军队，我国领土台湾尚待解放。因此，我们绝不能丧失警惕，中国人民解放军要和伟大的苏军在一起，警惕地保卫远东和世界的和平！
      经过整风运动和反右派斗争，在我国的政治战线上和思想战线上形成了一个非常广泛和非常深刻的社会主义革命运动。全国业已出现新的面貌。军队的整风是全民整风运动的一个重要部分。现在已经可以看到，经过整风全军的工作和全军的成员都有了前所未有的进步。军队的建设正在进入一个新的阶段。我们当前的任务就是要把整风运动坚持到底，彻底打掉官气，打掉暮气，打掉骄气，打掉娇气，改造思想，改进工作，进一步增强团结，发扬全体官兵的积极性和创造性，巩固军民的密切联系，参加生产劳动，支援国家建设，克服铺张浪费，实行勤俭建军。我们相信，解放军全体同志一定能够继续发扬我军的优良传统，完满实现整风运动中所提出的上述要求。同时，我们也相信，配合着我国国民经济的新跃进，我们就一定能够更快地把我军建设成像苏军那样优良的现代化的革命军队。
    同志们！在苏军建军四十周年的节日里，让我们再一次表示在中国共产党领导下的中国人民解放军将永远是伟大的苏联人民和苏联军队最忠实的战友，我们将永远同苏联人民和苏联军队肩并肩地为保卫世界和平，和人类正义事业奋斗到底。
    世界和平的坚强支柱，英勇的苏联军队万岁！
    中苏两国人民和军队间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
