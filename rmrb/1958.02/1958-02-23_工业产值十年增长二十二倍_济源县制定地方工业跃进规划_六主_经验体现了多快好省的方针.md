    Industrial Output Value to Increase Twenty-Two Times in Ten Years
    Jiyuan County Formulates Local Industrial Leap Forward Plan
    “Six Main” Experiences Embody the Principle of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
    (Our reporter Zhang Jianhong reports) Jiyuan County, Henan Province, famous for its management of the Mang River, recently formulated a heroic plan for a great leap forward in local industry in the next ten years. This plan is inspiring, demonstrating the county’s brilliant prospects for industrial development and providing a good example for the development of local industry in various regions.
    Jiyuan County is a resource-rich area with relatively large reserves of coal, lead, iron, sulfur, and other minerals, as well as a considerable amount of water resources. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the county relied on its local resources to initially develop local industry. The proportion of local industrial output value to total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 0.4% in 1952 to 16.21% in 1957. Local industry has increased twenty-fold in five years, laying a favorable foundation for the future great leap forward in industry. The Jiyuan County Party Committee took these factors into practical consideration when formulating the plan this time.
    Based on the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, the plan proposes that in the next five years, the proportion of local industrial output value to total industrial and agricultural output value will increase to more than 50%, and in the next ten years, it will reach more than 60%, striving to reach 70%. That is to say, the total industrial output value can increase twenty-two times by 1967 compared to 1957.
    The experience of Jiyuan County in developing local industry in recent years proves that focusing entirely on building large factories and mines, waiting for state investment, emphasizing the difficulties of technology, raw materials, and sales, and believing that county-run industries have no future are all manifestations of right-leaning conservative thinking. Only by constantly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, self-reliantly overcoming various difficulties, and starting from the needs of local people’s production and life, can we find the basic path for developing local industry. In this regard, under the guidance of Comrade Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiyuan County summarized the “Six Main” experiences: First, grasp the county’s economic characteristics, mobilize the masses to tap potential, and focus on using local raw materials, taking materials locally, and processing and manufacturing them locally; second, focus on the accumulation of funds by local industry and handicrafts themselves, and utilize all possible funds to accelerate industrial construction according to the principle of less investment and faster returns; third, focus on small-scale operations, making use of whatever is available, fully utilize idle agricultural labor, and run enterprises diligently and thriftily; fourth, focus on running comprehensive enterprises to maintain continuous production and use profits from some sectors to support others; fifth, focus on the existing technical force, teach and learn from each other, train in the short term, improve technical level, call on cadres to study technology, actively search for local talents in the county, invite teachers to train apprentices, send people out to visit and study, and strengthen the technical force; sixth, face the countryside, focus on local sales, earnestly serve agricultural production, and establish a planned industrial system centered on machinery and fertilizers to serve agriculture.
    The plan absorbed these experiences, implemented the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, grasped the principle of serving agricultural production, and embodied the spirit of starting from the convenience of the masses and from the development of production. According to these guiding ideologies, the County Party Committee, in the plan, focused on establishing a machinery industry network, a fertilizer manufacturing network, and a power network, considered the industrial distribution of the entire county, and proposed thirty-four industrial development projects. It is estimated that by 1967, the county’s total agricultural output value can reach 77.73 million yuan, and the total output value of county-run local industry can reach 138.6 million yuan. In terms of developing the machinery industry and vigorously supporting agricultural technical transformation, the plan decided to expand the existing handicraft ironware cooperatives and joint state-private iron factories in the county into a comprehensive machinery factory, which will have 30 various machine tools by 1962 and will increase to 50 by 1967. A machinery repair factory will be set up in each of the county’s seven major towns; in addition, 18 agricultural implement repair stations will be established at the township level. In terms of the electricity industry, the county’s existing power plant has a capacity of 60 kilowatts. By 1962, as a result of the construction of new power plants in villages and towns and the expansion of urban power plants, the capacity will increase to 740 kilowatts. By 1957, power plants will be established in more villages and towns, and the capacity can increase to 2,300 kilowatts; in addition, there are a number of small power plants built by agricultural cooperatives and other parties to meet the needs of production and domestic electricity consumption that are not included in the calculation. In terms of fertilizer, in addition to building three county-run chemical fertilizer factories with a total annual output of 40,000 tons within ten years, all agricultural production cooperatives are required to use their accumulated funds to build a granular fertilizer factory each, and large cooperatives will also build a mixed fertilizer factory. In this way, an average of 37 jin of chemical fertilizer can be applied per mu of the county’s 800,000 mu of cultivated land, which is a powerful guarantee for achieving the county’s agricultural plan of producing 750 jin of grain per mu. The plan also determined to develop metallurgical plants, cement plants, knitting factories, paper mills, printing factories, food factories, and other industries.
    At present, the Jiyuan County Party Committee has begun to organize the implementation of this plan. Sixteen small factories will be newly built in the first half of this year, including a mixed fertilizer factory with an annual output of 15,000 tons, four comprehensive machinery repair factories, four power plants, two oil factories, and wineries, etc. Another four small factories will be newly built in the second half of the year. The output value of these factories will reach 1.225 million yuan. With the addition of several newly built coal mines, metallurgical plants, etc., put into production, it is estimated that this year’s industrial output value will double that of 1957.

    工业产值十年增长二十二倍
    济源县制定地方工业跃进规划
    “六主”经验体现了多快好省的方针
    本报讯　记者张健虹报道：以治理漭河著名的河南省济源县，最近制定了今后十年内地方工业大跃进的英雄规划。这个规划振奋人心，显示出这个县工业发展的灿烂前景，并且为各地地方工业的发展提供了一个良好的范例。
    济源县是一个资源比较丰富的地方，煤、铅、铁、硫磺等蕴藏量较多，同时有相当数量的水力资源。在第一个五年计划期间，这个县就依靠本地的资源，初步发展了地方工业。地方工业的产值占工农业总产值的比重，已经由1952年的0.4％增长到1957年的16.21％。五年中地方工业增长了二十倍，为今后工业大跃进奠定了有利的基础。这次中共济源县委在制定规划时，对以上因素都作了切实的考虑。
    规划根据多快好省的方针，提出在今后五年内使地方工业产值占工农业产值的比重，增长到50％以上，在今后十年内达到60％以上，争取达到70％。也就是说，工业总产值到1967年可以比1957年增长二十二倍。
    几年来济源县发展地方工业的经验证明，把目光完全朝向开办大厂、大矿，等待国家投资，强调技术、原料、销路的困难，认为县营工业没有搞头，都是右倾保守思想在作怪；只有不断地克服右倾保守思想，自力更生地克服各种困难，从当地人民生产、生活的需要出发，才是发展地方工业的基本道路。在这方面，济源县在中共河南省委书记杨蔚屏同志的指导下总结出了“六主”的经验：一是掌握本县经济特点，发动群众挖掘潜力，以自有原料为主，就地取材，就地加工制造；二是以地方工业、手工业本身积累资金为主，并且利用各种可能利用的资金，按照投资少收效快的原则，加速工业建设；三是以小型为主，因陋就简，充分利用农闲劳动力，勤俭办企业；四是以办综合性的企业为主，保持连续生产，以肥养瘦；五是以现有技术力量为主，互教互学，短期训练，提高技术水平，号召干部钻研技术，积极搜罗本县人材，请老师带徒弟，派人出去参观学习，壮大技术力量；六是面向农村，以就地销售为主，认真为农业生产服务，有计划地建立起以机械、肥料为中心的为农业服务的工业系统。
    规划吸收了这些经验，贯彻了多快好省的方针，掌握了为农业生产服务的原则，体现了从便利群众出发、从发展生产出发的精神。按照这些指导思想，县委在规划中以建立机械工业网、肥料制造网和动力网为中心，考虑了全县的工业分布，提出了三十四个发展工业的项目。预计到1967年，全县农业总产值可以达到七千七百七十三万元，县营地方工业总产值可以达到一亿三千八百六十万元。在发展机械工业、大力支援农业技术改造方面，规划中决定以县里现有手工业铁业社和公私合营铁工厂为基础，扩建为一个综合机械厂，1962年各种车床将有三十部，到1967年将增加到五十台。在全县七个主要的小镇上，都将分别设有一个机械修配厂；另外还要以乡为单位，建立农具修配站十八个。在电业方面，这个县现有发电厂的容量是六十瓩，到1962年，由于村镇新建电厂和城市电厂扩建的结果，容量将增加到七百四十瓩，到1957年，发电厂将在更多的村镇建立，容量可以增加到两千三百瓩；此外还有农业合作社和其他方面为适应生产、生活用电需要而兴建的若干小型发电厂没有计算在内。肥料方面，在十年内除建立三座县营的、共年产四万吨化学肥料的工厂以外，要求所有的农业生产合作社用自己积累的资金各建一座颗粒肥料厂，大社还要建一座混合肥料厂。这样，全县八十万亩耕地平均每亩可施化学肥料三十七斤，对于实现县农业规划中亩产粮食七百五十斤是一个有力的保证。规划中还确定要发展冶炼厂、水泥厂、针织厂、造纸厂、印刷厂、食品厂等其他工业。
    目前，济源县委已经开始组织实现这个规划。今年上半年将新建十六个小型工厂，其中包括一座年产一万五千吨肥料的混合肥料厂，四座综合机械修配厂，四座发电厂，两座油厂，以及酿酒厂等。下半年将再新建四座小型工厂。这些工厂的产值将达一百二十二万五千元。加上若干新建煤矿、冶炼厂等投入生产，预计今年工业产值将比1957年增长一倍。
