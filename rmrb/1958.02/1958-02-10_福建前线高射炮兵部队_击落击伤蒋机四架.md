　　Fujian Front High-Altitude Artillery Unit
    Shoots Down and Damages Four Chiang Kai-shek Aircraft
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, February 7th: On February 3rd, the high-altitude artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front shot down and damaged four Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.
    At 12:54 on February 3rd, a group of four Chiang Kai-shek F-84 jet fighters strafed our civilian cargo ships on the sea southeast of Dongchongkou, Sandu Ao, Fujian Province. The People's Liberation Army high-altitude artillery units guarding a certain island in northeastern Fujian immediately fired fiercely at the enemy planes, damaging one of them. Subsequently, as this group of Chiang Kai-shek planes fled in panic, they passed over the Huangqi Peninsula and were once again fiercely attacked head-on by a unit of our high-altitude artillery, with one shot down and one damaged. The wreckage of the downed Chiang Kai-shek plane fell into the sea east of the Matsu Islands.
    In addition, at 13:36 on February 3rd, a group of two Chiang Kai-shek RF-86 and two RF-84 aircraft, which were conducting reconnaissance over Huian, Putian, Longtian, and other areas, had one of their planes damaged by our high-altitude artillery units.
