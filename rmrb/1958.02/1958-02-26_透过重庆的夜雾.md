    Through the Night Mist of Chongqing
    Xiao Qi
    A black velvet curtain gently wraps Chongqing,
    The battling citadel still cannot be calm.
    Through the vast night mist, I lift my eyes to gaze,
    Lights are bright, ah, lights are bright…
    No, through the night mist I see,
    What those windows emit is not lamplight,
    But Chongqing’s gaze, yearning for the future.
    I see that is not lamplight,
    It is a chimney using a red glow to write a chapter of new life,
    It is the sharp gleam of a warrior’s sword.
    I see that is not lamplight,
    It is a happy mother ship,
    Adorned with glory, sailing at night.
    I see that is not lamplight, ah,
    It is the shining feathers of wings—
    The mountain eagle majestically perched on the edge of the mighty river,
    Tomorrow will soar high, sweeping through the waves of the era…

    透过重庆的夜雾
    萧旗
    黑色的绒幕轻裹重庆
    战斗的城堡依然不能平静
    透过茫茫夜雾我举目四望
    灯火通明呀灯火通明……
    不呵，透过夜雾我看见了
    那窗口吐露的不是灯火
    是重庆憧憬未来的目光
    我看见那不是灯火
    是烟囱用红霞写新生活的篇章
    是勇士的宝剑闪烁锋芒
    我看见那不是灯火
    是一只幸福的母舰
    浑身披挂着光荣夜航
    我看见那不是灯火呵
    是翅膀的羽毛发亮——
    滔滔大江边雄踞的山鹰
    明朝将扑扫时代的浪涛高翔……
