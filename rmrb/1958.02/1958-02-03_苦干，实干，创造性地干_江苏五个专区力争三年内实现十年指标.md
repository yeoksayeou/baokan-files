Five Special Zones in Jiangsu Strive to Achieve Ten-Year Targets in Three Years

(Our Dispatch) XinHua Daily News: The Suzhou, Yangzhou, Nantong, Huaiyin, and Xuzhou Prefectural Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province respectively convened county (city) Party committee secretary meetings or expanded meetings in January. At these meetings, the "Decision on Striving for Five Hundred Jin and Eight Hundred Jin Ahead of Schedule by Working Hard for Five Years" of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee's Enlarged Meeting was discussed, and the agricultural production plans of these special zones were revised. It was decided to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to work hard for three years to achieve the increased production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

The struggle goals proposed by the county Party committee secretaries and Changshu city Party committee secretary of the nine counties in the Suzhou Special Zone at the meeting convened by the prefectural committee are: "Achieve Eight Hundred Jin in Three Years of Hard Work, Become a Thousand Jin Zone in Five Years of Hard Work." According to the revised grain yield targets of each county, the Suzhou Special Zone will become an Eight Hundred Jin Special Zone in 1960. Among them, Jiangyin, Zhenze, Wuxi, and the suburban area of Changshu will reach and exceed Eight Hundred Jin in 1958. Changshu and Wuxian will also strive to reach Eight Hundred Jin in 1958; Wujiang, Taicang, and Wujin will reach Eight Hundred Jin in 1959; only Kunshan County will reach Eight Hundred Jin in 1960. The county Party committee secretaries also revised the winter and spring production plans according to the new targets, and put forward resolute measures to basically eliminate waterlogging disasters in one year, achieve drought and flood protection in two years, and strive to exceed the fertilizer application level of well-to-do middle peasants in 1958.

The Yangzhou Special Zone decided to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to "Work Hard for Three Years to Basically Achieve Eight Hundred Jin." Starting from this target requirement, it requires working hard for three years to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters; a total of 600 million cubic meters of earthwork must be completed in three years. The task of accumulating fertilizer for the whole year of 1958 is required to increase from 3 billion dan to 4.36 billion dan; vigorously develop pig breeding, and the plan for this year is to increase from 1.74 million pigs in 1957 to 6 million pigs, and to develop to 13.5 million pigs in 1960, reaching one pig per mu. At the same time, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out agricultural system reform.

The Nantong Special Zone proposed to mobilize the entire Party and all the people to launch a shock campaign to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters in two years, and work hard for three years to achieve the targets of one hundred jin of ginned cotton and eight hundred jin of grain. All counties have revised their original plans. Chongming and Haimen counties proposed to strive to achieve eight hundred jin of grain in 1958; Qidong, Chongming, Nantong, and Haimen counties proposed to achieve one hundred jin of ginned cotton in 1958. Departments at the prefectural and special district levels have also formulated plans and are determined to vigorously support the great leap forward in agricultural production.

The leap forward plan proposed by the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee's Enlarged Meeting is: "Five Hundred Jin in Three Years, Crossing the Yangtze River in Five Years." And it decided to adopt four measures: First, in terms of water conservancy construction, a total of 1 billion cubic meters of earthwork will be completed in three years to achieve drought and flood protection, of which 400 million cubic meters of earthwork must be done in 1958. Second, improve the level of fertilizer application. In 1958, the average fertilizer application per mu in the entire special zone was 232 dan, and it will reach 378 dan in 1960. The number of pigs raised in 1958 will increase from 1.25 million in 1957 to 5 million, an average of 4.2 pigs per household; by 1960, the average number of pigs raised per household will reach 8. Third, vigorously carry out agricultural system reform. In 1958, 1.5 million mu will be converted from "dry to wet," and a total of 6.1 million mu will be converted in three years, reaching 8 million mu including the original rice area. Fourth, improve the soil. There are 5.05 million mu of saline-alkali land and sandy wasteland in the whole area, and it is required to improve 1.3 million mu in 1958 and complete all improvements by 1960.

The enlarged meeting convened by the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee with the participation of the first secretaries of the county Party committees decided to strive to achieve the target of five hundred jin in three years, and by 1960, the total grain output will increase to 6 billion jin. In three years, 700 million cubic meters of earthwork will be done in water conservancy construction, basically realizing water conservancy and eliminating drought and flood disasters; leaping forward targets and specific measures to achieve the targets were also put forward for developing pig raising, vigorously accumulating fertilizer, and converting dry land into paddy fields.

The comrades who attended these meetings all believed that agricultural production is already in a stage of great leap forward, therefore, the guiding ideology and leadership style must also have a great leap forward at the same time. The Suzhou Special Zone County (City) Party Committee Secretary Meeting reviewed the production movement in the previous period, further criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and the Yangzhou Special Zone County (City) Party Committee Secretary Meeting also criticized the conservative and backward thinking and the old way of doing things in which the thinking could not keep up with the situation and the leadership could not keep up with the masses, and demanded that the guiding ideology be completely liberated. These meetings all emphasized the need to work practically, work hard, and work creatively; to constantly discover the advanced, promote the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. At the same time, it is believed that: the first year determines the next three years, and the current situation determines the first year. The success or failure of current production has a great impact on the realization of the great leap forward in production; therefore, it is necessary to resolutely guarantee the completion of various winter and spring production tasks.

    江苏五个专区力争三年内实现十年指标
    本报讯　新华日报消息：中共江苏省苏州地委、扬州地委、南通地委、淮阴地委、徐州地委在1月份分别召开县（市）委书记会议或扩大会议。在这些会议上，讨论了江苏省委扩大会议关于“苦干五年，提前实现五百斤、八百斤”的决定，修订了这几个专区的农业生产规划，决定动员全党全民，苦干三年，提前实现农业发展纲要所规定的增产指标。
    苏州专区九县中共县委书记和常熟市委书记在地委召开的会议上提出的奋斗目标是：“苦干三年实现八百斤，苦干五年成为千斤区”。根据各县重新修订的粮食产量指标，苏州专区将在1960年成为八百斤专区。其中江阴、震泽、无锡以及常熟市郊区都将在1958年达到和超过八百斤，常熟、吴县也将在1958年争取达到八百斤；吴江、太仓、武进将在1959年达到八百斤；只有昆山一个县将在1960年达到八百斤。县委书记们并根据新的指标修订了冬春生产规划，提出了一年基本消除内涝灾害，二年做到旱涝无忧，以及在1958年争取超过富裕中农施肥水平的坚决措施。
    扬州专区决定动员全党全民，“苦干三年，基本实现八百斤”。从这个指标要求出发，要求苦干三年，基本消灭旱涝灾害；三年内共须完成土方六亿方。要求1958年全年积肥任务由三十亿担增至四十三亿六千万担；大力发展生猪，今年计划由1957年圈存一百七十四万头，增加到六百万头，1960年发展到一千三百五十万头，达到每亩一头猪。同时还要大力进行农业改制工作。
    南通专区提出动员全党、全民，突击两年基本消灭旱涝灾害，苦干三年实现百斤皮棉、八百斤粮食的指标。各县都修订了原来规划。崇明、海门两县提出力争1958年实现粮食八百斤；启东、崇明、南通、海门四县提出1958年实现百斤皮棉。地、专各部门也订了规划，决心大力支持农业生产大跃进。
    淮阴地委扩大会议提出的跃进规划是：“三年五百斤，五年跨长江”。并决定采取四项措施：一、在兴修水利方面，三年共做十亿土方，达到旱涝无忧，其中1958年要做四亿土方。二、提高施肥水平。1958年，全专区平均每亩施肥二百三十二担，1960年达到三百七十八担。1958年养猪从1957年一百二十五万头增加到五百万头，平均每户四点二头；到1960年平均每户养猪达到八头。三、大力进行农业改制工作。1958年要“旱改水”一百五十万亩，三年内共要改六百一十万亩，连原有水稻面积达到八百万亩。四、改良土壤。全区有盐碱地和沙荒地五百零五万亩，要求1958年改良一百三十万亩，1960年全部改完。
    徐州地委召开的有县委第一书记参加的扩大会议，决定力争在三年内实现五百斤的指标，到1960年，粮食总产量增加到六十亿斤。在三年内，要兴修水利七亿土方，基本上实现水利化，免除旱涝灾害；对于发展养猪、大力积肥和改旱地为水田等，也提出了跃进指标和实现指标的具体措施。
    出席这些会议的同志们，都认为目前农业生产已经处在大跃进阶段，因此，领导思想和领导作风必须同时来个大跃进。苏州专区县（市）委书记会议检查了前一时期的生产运动，进一步批判了右倾保守思想，扬州专区县（市）委书记会议也批判了思想跟不上形势、领导跟不上群众的保守落后思想和老一套的作风，要求领导思想彻底解放。这些会议都强调要实干、苦干、创造性地干；要不断地发现先进，推广先进，赶上先进。同时认为：三年看头年，头年看当前，当前生产搞得好坏，对实现生产大跃进有极大的影响；因此，必须坚决保证完成各项冬春生产任务。
