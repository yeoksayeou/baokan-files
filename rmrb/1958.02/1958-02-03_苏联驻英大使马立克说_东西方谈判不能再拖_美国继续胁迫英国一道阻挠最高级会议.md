　　Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd -- According to TASS London, February 1st: Soviet Ambassador to Britain Malik said on January 31st that East-West negotiations cannot be delayed any longer. He pointed out: "A top-level meeting must be held so that the heads of state can eliminate obstacles of distrust, thereby seeking ways to stop the Cold War."
　　Malik also said at a banquet hosted by the British "Foyles" bookstore that the Soviet government, in order to ease tensions and create conditions for peaceful coexistence, put forward specific proposals for convening a high-level meeting attended by heads of government as soon as possible in order to resolve issues such as stopping nuclear tests, banning the use of nuclear weapons, concluding non-aggression treaties, normalizing trade, expanding international scientific, cultural, and other ties, stopping the "Cold War," eliminating war mania, and establishing normal and peaceful conditions for human life.
　　Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd -- According to TASS Paris, February 1st: The French "Liberation" reported that the U.S. government is making every effort to force the British government to compromise on the issue of holding an East-West summit, and to "refuse to hold a high-level meeting without first convening a foreign ministers' meeting" along with the United States.
　　"Liberation" said that a tense struggle is currently underway within the British government on the issue of holding a high-level meeting. The British government is delaying its response to Bulganin's second letter to Macmillan, citing the British Prime Minister's visit abroad. "Liberation" wrote: "In fact, one has the impression that the British government is in a state of division."
　　The newspaper said that it must be pointed out that on the issue of holding a high-level meeting, the French government, along with the U.S. government, is jointly forcing the British to compromise.

　　苏联驻英大使马立克说
    东西方谈判不能再拖
    美国继续胁迫英国一道阻挠最高级会议
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社伦敦1日讯：苏联驻英国大使马立克1月31日说：东西方谈判不能再拖延。他指出：“必须举行最高级会议，以便各国首脑消除不信任的障碍，从而谋求停止冷战的途径”。
    马立克在英国“福伊尔斯”书店主办的宴会上还说，苏联政府为了缓和紧张局势和创造和平共处的条件，提出了关于尽速召开有各国政府首脑参加的高级会议的具体建议，以便解决像停止核试验，禁止使用核武器，缔结互不侵犯条约，贸易正常化，扩大国际科学、文化和其他联系，停止“冷战”，消除战争狂，为人类的生活建立正常和安静的条件这样一些迫切问题。
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社巴黎1日讯：法国“解放报”报道，美国政府在竭力迫使英国政府在举行东西方最高级会议问题上让步，而跟美国一道“拒绝在没有召开外长会议以前便举行高级会议”。
    “解放报”说，目前英国政府内部正在召开高级会议问题上进行着紧张的斗争。英国政府借口英国首相在国外访问而对布尔加宁给麦克米伦的第二封信迟迟不作答复。“解放报”写道：“实际上人们有这样的印象：英国政府内部处于分裂状态。”
    这家报纸说，必须指出，在举行高级会议问题上，法国政府同美国政府一道，在共同迫使英国人让步。
