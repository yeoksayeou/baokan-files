Compete with the Advanced, Learn from the Advanced, Catch up with the Advanced

Recently, newspapers across the country have been filled with the heroic voices of competing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. More and more enterprises and workers are consciously adopting competing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced as their program of action, searching for advanced indicators and competitors within their own enterprises, within their own regions, nationally, and even internationally. Many enterprises, through the activities of competing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, have fully tapped their production potential, repeatedly raising the state's planned targets. The news report on the Beijing Railway Administration's 1958 Conference of Advanced Producers and Employee Representatives published in today's newspaper is a vivid and powerful example.

In 1957, the Beijing Railway Administration ranked first in the national railway system in terms of cost, labor productivity, and profit remittance. However, the remaining eight or nine major technical indicators lagged behind those of other administrations. At this conference, after advanced producers and employee representatives summarized and exchanged experiences, the result of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced was that the eleven major planned targets proposed have all caught up with and surpassed the most advanced level of the national railway's 1958 plan.

There are many examples of great leaps forward like the Beijing Railway Administration. This is a sign of the upsurge in industrial production and construction sparked by the rectification campaign, a sign of the soaring socialist revolutionary fervor of China's working class, and a sign of the vigorous vitality of China's socialist system. Expanding and persevering in this vigorous competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced will surely fundamentally change China's economic landscape in a relatively short period of time.

The main task of the Chinese people in the next fifteen years is to make the output of steel and other important industrial products in our country catch up with or surpass the level of the United Kingdom and to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science. The current economic, cultural, and technical level of our country is still very low. We must mobilize all positive factors and carry out a long-term and arduous struggle to achieve our great historical mission. Carrying out the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is an effective way to mobilize the enthusiasm of millions of workers and staff to achieve our great task.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi, when delivering a congratulatory message on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to the National Conference of Advanced Producers on April 30, 1956, said: "The history of human society, in the final analysis, is the history of production, the history of producers. Production is always in a state of development and change, with new production technologies constantly replacing old ones. Therefore, in any era and in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who adopt more advanced production technologies and create more advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their techniques and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the whole society, and social production improves." This is the law of social production development. Under the exploitative system of the old society, the process of turning the production level of a few advanced elements into the production level of the whole society is very slow. This is because exploiters only use the creations of advanced producers when they benefit them; otherwise, they suppress the creations of advanced producers. And exploiters often restrict others from learning and using these creations for the sake of "patents." In socialist society, the interests of socialism are consistent with the interests of producers. Not only does no one prevent the learning and utilization of the experiences and technologies created by advanced producers, but on the contrary, the Communist Party and the People's Government always try every means to encourage people to learn and utilize advanced production experiences and technologies, and lead millions of workers and staff in the struggle to eliminate backwardness and rapidly reach the level of advanced producers. Now, the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced that has been launched on the basis of the rectification movement is precisely a conscious struggle by millions of working people to eliminate backwardness and to quickly transform the production indicators of a few advanced producers into the production indicators of the whole society. This struggle is a driving force for the continuous and rapid progress of our socialist economy. We must attach great importance to this mass struggle to eliminate backwardness.

From a national perspective, the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is only just beginning. Whether viewed from the number of people participating in the competition or from the types of work participating in the competition; whether viewed from the items of the competition or from the scope of the competition, it is still not broad enough or deep enough. We must take various measures to expand this competition. Not only should this competition be carried out between individuals, between groups, and between workshops; it should also be carried out between factories, between regions, and between related industries. Not only should we compare output, quality, cost, labor productivity, and safety, but also the trial production of new products, the utilization of substitutes, cooperation, management work, political work, and leadership methods. In short, wherever there is a difference between advanced and backward, the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced should be carried out there.

In the process of development, everything always has differences between the advanced and the backward. In the production movement, there are always a few advanced workers, advanced groups, advanced workshops, and advanced enterprises that are ahead of the general workers, general groups, general workshops, and enterprises. When general workers, general groups, general workshops, and enterprises catch up with the few advanced workers and advanced units, new few advanced workers and advanced units will appear, and new differences between advanced and backward will form. New differences constantly replace old differences. Therefore, the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is endless. Throughout the long journey of the competition, sometimes this group of people and this group of units are at the forefront, and sometimes another group of people and another group of units are leading. If I am at the forefront, you will work hard to catch up with me; if you are leading, I will work hard to catch up with you. Everyone is working hard to catch up, and our socialist economy is developing rapidly in this way.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: Modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind. Individuals and units that are at the forefront in the competition should work even harder with humility, constantly enrich their advanced experiences and technologies, and constantly improve their advanced quotas, strive for the upstream, and strive to be more advanced. At the same time, they should also use all means to help and teach others, strive to promote others from backwardness to advancement, and improve together. Individuals and units that are temporarily behind do not need to be discouraged. As long as you admit that others are advanced and you are backward, and humbly learn from the advanced, and turn the advanced technologies and experiences of others into your own technologies and experiences, you can turn backwardness into advancement. For example, in the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory sent people to fraternal factories in Qishuyan, Huangguangtun, Mudanjiang, and Tangshan to learn advanced experiences, and applied these experiences to production. As a result, within one month, the cycle of major and medium repairs of locomotives exceeded the level of the most advanced Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in the country, and the cycle of major repairs of passenger cars, the cost of major repairs of wooden-skinned hard-seat passenger cars, and the cost of medium repairs of steel-skinned passenger cars jumped from the third, sixth, and fifth places in the country to the first place, respectively. This fact tells us a truth, that is, not to be afraid of temporary backwardness, but to be afraid of being content with backwardness and persisting in backwardness. Being content with backwardness and persisting in backwardness is essentially maintaining the backward state of production and maintaining the economic backwardness of our country, which is a manifestation of losing revolutionary vigor. We must sweep away the twilight, invigorate our spirits, muster revolutionary enthusiasm, and forge ahead courageously. Pessimism and discouragement are unfounded. The working class should have the heroic spirit of everyone striving to be advanced and everyone being advanced.

Organizing the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is also a leadership method to promote a comprehensive leap forward in production. Now, in many places, the current comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is where workers find advanced opponents themselves, or factories find advanced opponents themselves. There are not many places where this competition is carried out in a led manner in a region or in a department. Of course, it is very good and worthy of promotion for the masses of workers or enterprises to find advanced opponents themselves and propose leap forward goals themselves. However, without the organization and leadership of higher-level authorities, only with the active actions of the masses and enterprises, the competition is difficult to last and the effect is not great. Therefore, we hope that industrial leadership departments at all levels, especially the central industrial leadership departments that grasp the national production situation, will take on the organizational and leadership work of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. It is necessary to regularly analyze the production situation of various enterprises, conduct periodic evaluations, and announce the results of the competition so that the masses know where the advanced indicators are? Where to learn from? Where to catch up with? The leading organs must also constantly give new tasks to enterprises or the masses of workers. When people have just completed a task, they must immediately be given a new task; when people have just reached an advanced indicator, they must immediately be given a more advanced indicator so that people have no room for pride and complacency, but always maintain a full fighting mood.

Leaders must abandon the bureaucratic style of being high above and not understanding the situation below, go out of the office, go to the grassroots organizations, go to the boiling production reality, and promptly summarize and promote the technologies and experiences of advanced workers, workshops, and enterprises, and do their best to issue new tasks, new indicators, and new experiences and new technologies at the same time. The masses have a clear understanding of the goals of the struggle, and also master the weapons to achieve the goals, their confidence will be higher, and their enthusiasm will be greater. In this way, in a relatively short period of time, the advancement of individual workers can advance to the advancement of the entire workshop; the advancement of individual workshops can advance to the advancement of the entire enterprise; the advancement of individual enterprises can advance to the advancement of the entire industry; and the advancement of individual industries can advance to the advancement of the entire department and the entire region. In this way, the economic level of our country will leap forward again and again in the sound of the rear waves pushing the front waves and the backward catching up with the advanced.

My country's national economic plan for 1958 has been discussed and decided by the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress. This is a plan to strive for a new leap forward in the national economy in order to make the output of steel and other important industrial products catch up with or exceed that of the United Kingdom within fifteen years. According to this plan, this year's growth rate of my country's total industrial output value and basic construction investment will increase by more than double the planned growth rate in 1957. The facts of the Beijing Railway Administration and many other enterprises prove that the production potential of my country's industry, transportation industry, and basic construction enterprises is very great, and it is entirely possible to complete this year's growth rate. Looking at the next five years from the perspective of the first three, and looking at the next three years from the perspective of the first, may every department, every enterprise, and every employee muster revolutionary enthusiasm, like the Beijing Railway Administration, in the upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, to strive to complete and over fulfill this year's state plan with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 比先进  学先进  赶先进

    比先进  学先进  赶先进
    最近各地报纸上充满着比先进、学先进、赶先进的豪迈的声音。越来越多的企业，越来越多的工人都自觉地把比先进、学先进、赶先进作为自己的行动纲领，在自己的企业内，在自己的地区内，在全国范围内，甚至在国际上寻找先进指标，寻找竞赛的对手。许多企业通过比先进、学先进、赶先进的活动，充分发掘生产潜力，一而再再而三地提高国家计划指标。今天本报发表的北京铁路管理局1958年先进生产者及职工代表会议的新闻所反映的情况，就是一个生动有力的例子。
    北京铁路管理局在1957年，除了成本、劳动生产率和上缴利润三项指标居于全国铁路系统的第一位以外，其余八、九项主要技术指标，都落在其他管理局的后面。在这次会议上，先进生产者和职工代表们总结和交流了经验以后，互相比先进、学先进、赶先进的结果，提出的十一项主要计划指标，都已赶上并超过了全国铁路1958年计划的最先进的水平。
    像北京铁路管理局这样大跃进的事例还有许多。这是在整风基础上掀起的工业生产和建设高潮的标志，是我国工人阶级社会主义革命干劲昂扬的标志，是我国社会主义制度生命力旺盛的标志。把这个生气勃勃的比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛运动扩大和坚持下去，一定能够在比较短的时间内根本改变我国的经济面貌。
    我国人民在今后十五年内的主要任务，就是要使我国钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量赶上或超过英国的水平，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。我们国家现在的经济、文化和技术水平还是很低的。我们必须动员一切积极因素，进行长期的艰苦的斗争，才能实现我们的伟大的历史任务。开展比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛，正是动员千百万职工群众的积极性，实现我们伟大的任务的有效办法。
    刘少奇同志在1956年4月30日，代表中共中央向全国先进生产者代表会议致祝词的时候说：“人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。”这是社会生产发展的规律。在旧社会的剥削制度之下，少数先进分子的生产水平变成全社会的生产水平的过程是非常缓慢的。这是因为，当先进生产者的创造有利于剥削者的时候，剥削者才利用这种创造，否则，就压制先进生产者的创造；并且剥削者常常为着“专利”而限制别人学习和利用这种创造。在社会主义社会里，社会主义利益同生产者的利益是一致的，不但没有人阻止学习和利用先进生产者创造的经验和技术，而且相反，共产党和人民政府总是想尽各种办法来鼓励人们学习和利用先进的生产经验和技术，领导千百万职工群众为消除落后，迅速达到先进生产者的水平而斗争。现在，在整风运动的基础上开展起来的比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛，正是千百万劳动群众为了消除落后，为了迅速地把少数先进生产者的生产指标变为全社会的生产指标而进行的自觉的斗争。这种斗争，就是我们社会主义经济不断地迅速地前进的一种动力。我们必须十分重视这种群众性的为消除落后而进行的斗争。
    从全国的范围来看，比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛，现在还只是开始。不论从参加竞赛的人数来看，或者从参加竞赛的工种来看；不论是从竞赛的项目来看，或者从竞赛的范围来看，都还不够广，不够深。我们必须采取各种措施来扩大这种竞赛。不仅在个人与个人之间、小组与小组之间、车间与车间之间应该开展这种竞赛；在工厂与工厂之间、地区与地区之间、有联系的行业与行业之间，也应该开展这种竞赛。不仅比产量，比质量，比成本，比劳动生产率，比安全，还要比试制新产品，比利用代用品，比协作，比管理工作，比政治工作，比领导方法。总之，哪里有先进与落后的差别，就应该在哪里开展比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛。
    一切事物在发展的过程中总是存在先进与落后的差别的。在生产运动中，总有少数先进工人、先进小组、先进车间、先进企业，走在一般工人、一般小组、一般车间和企业的前头。当一般工人、一般小组、一般车间和企业赶上少数先进工人、先进单位的时候，新的少数先进工人、先进单位又将出现，又形成新的先进与落后的差别。新的差别不断地代替着旧的差别。因而，比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛就永无止境。在整个竞赛的长途中，有时候是这一部分人、这一部分单位走在前头，有时候是另一部分人、另一部分单位领先。我走在前头的，你就努力赶上我；你领先的，我就努力赶上你，大家都鼓足干劲往前赶，我们的社会主义经济就这样地迅速发展起来。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。在竞赛中走在前头的个人和单位，应该更加虚心地努力学习，不断地丰富自己的先进经验和技术，不断地提高自己的先进定额，力争上游，争取更加先进。同时，还要用一切办法来帮助和教会别人，努力促进别人由落后达到先进，共同提高。暂时走在后面的个人和单位也用不着气馁。只要承认别人先进，自己落后，虚心地向先进学习，把别人先进的技术和经验变为自己的技术和经验，就可以变落后为先进。例如，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂在比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛中，派人到戚墅堰、皇姑屯、牡丹江和唐山等地兄弟工厂去学习先进经验，并把这些经验运用到生产中去。结果在一个月内就使机车大修、中修的周期超过了全国最先进的戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂的水平，使客车大修周期、木皮硬席客车大修费用和钢皮客车中修费用，分别从原占全国的第三位、第六位和第五位跃进到第一位。这个事实告诉我们一个真理，这就是不怕暂时落后，只怕自甘落后和坚持落后。自甘落后和坚持落后，实质上就是保持生产的落后状态，保持我们国家的经济落后状态，这是丧失革命朝气的表现。我们必须扫除暮气，振作精神，鼓起革命干劲，奋勇直前。悲观、气馁是没有根据的。工人阶级应当有人人争先进，人人当先进的英雄气概。
    组织比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛，也是促进生产全面大跃进的领导方法。现在的比先进、学先进、赶先进，在许多地方，都是工人自己找先进的对手，或者是工厂自己找先进的对手的。在一个地区里，在一个部门里，有领导地开展这种竞赛的还不多。当然，工人群众或者工厂自己找先进对手，自己提出跃进的目标，这是很好的，值得提倡的事情。但是，只有群众和企业的积极行动，而没有上级机关的组织和领导，竞赛是很难持久的，效果也是不大的。因此，我们希望各级工业领导部门，特别是掌握全国生产情况的中央各个工业领导部门，把比先进、学先进、赶先进的组织工作和领导工作担当起来。要经常地分析各个企业的生产情况，定期进行评比，公布竞赛结果，让群众知道先进指标在哪里？该向哪里学习？向哪里赶？领导机关还必须不断地给企业或职工群众提出新任务。当人们刚刚完成一个任务的时候，马上要给他一个新任务；当人们刚刚达到一个先进指标的时候，马上要给他一个更先进的指标，使人们没有骄傲自满的余地，而永远保持饱满的战斗情绪。
    领导人员必须打掉高高在上的不了解下情的官僚主义作风，走出办公室，到基层组织中去，到沸腾的生产实际中去，及时地总结和推广先进工人、车间、企业的技术和经验，尽可能地做到新任务、新指标和新经验、新技术同时下达。群众既明确认清了奋斗的目标，又掌握了达到目标的武器，信心就会更高，干劲就会更大。这样，就可以在比较短的时间内由个别工人的先进，前进到整个车间的先进；由个别车间的先进，前进到整个企业的先进；由个别企业的先进，前进到整个行业的先进；由个别行业的先进，前进到整个部门、整个地区的先进。我们国家的经济水平，就这样在后浪推前浪，后进赶先进声中，跃进又跃进。
    我国1958年度的国民经济计划已经经过第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议讨论和决定。这是一个为了在十五年内使钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量赶上或超过英国的争取国民经济新跃进的计划。按照这个计划，今年我国工业总产值和基本建设投资的增长速度，比1957年的计划增长速度都将增加一倍以上。北京铁路管理局以及其他许多企业的事实证明，我国工业、交通运输业、基本建设企业的生产潜力非常之大，完成今年的增长速度是完全可能的。五年看三年，三年看头年，愿每一个部门、每一个企业、每一个职工都鼓起革命干劲，像北京铁路管理局那样，在比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮中，为又多、又快、又好、又省地完成和超额完成今年的国家计划而奋斗。
