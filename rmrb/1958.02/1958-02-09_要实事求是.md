Post-editing Notes

　　Be Realistic
　　It is inevitable to make mistakes in our work, and the important thing is what attitude we take towards mistakes.
　　Shanxi Province's approach to restoring the reputation of the "Three Treasures" is correct. This realistic and conscientious attitude of checking mistakes is worth promoting. In this way, we can learn from our mistakes, thereby finding the three treasures to promote the great leap forward in agriculture. Isn't this precisely turning negative factors into a positive force to promote work?
　　While various localities and departments are formulating five-year and ten-year long-term plans and proposing current goals, it would be of great benefit to promote the great leap forward in socialist construction if we could realistically review our past work like Shanxi, correct what we have done wrong as soon as possible, and restore the reputation of what should be restored.
　　However, some people still lack this realistic attitude. They often emphasize objective reasons in an attempt to shirk or mitigate subjective responsibility; some even simply ignore it, allowing mistakes to continue to exist and develop. This attitude is very bad, it will not only make them sink deeper and deeper into mistakes, but more seriously, it will cause undue losses to our socialist construction cause.

### 要实事求是

　　要实事求是
    做工作难免发生错误，重要的问题在于以什么态度对待错误。
    山西省为“三宝”恢复名誉的做法是对的。这种实事求是，认真检查错误的态度值得提倡。这样，我们就能够从错误中吸取教训，从而找到了促进农业大跃进的三件宝，这岂不正是化消极因素为推动工作的积极力量了吗？
    当各个地方、各个部门都在制定五年、十年远景规划和提出当前奋斗目标的同时，像山西那样实事求是地回顾一下以往的工作，把做错了的事即早改过来，该恢复名誉的就给它恢复，这对促进社会主义建设大跃进会有很大好处。
    但是，有些人还缺乏这种实事求是的态度。他们往往强调客观原因，企图推卸或减轻主观责任；有的甚至干脆置之不理，让错误继续存在和发展下去。这种态度很不好，它不仅会使自己在错误中愈陷愈深；更严重的是，使我们的社会主义建设事业受到不应有的损失。
