    Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Many factories in Beijing, while comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced, hope that relevant leadership organs will help them "exchange information" in order to overcome the difficulty of not being able to find advanced indicators or evaluation targets in a timely manner, so that revolutionary enthusiasm can be fully utilized.
    The workers of these factories have great enthusiasm and want to overcome backwardness and catch up with the advanced. However, some of them cannot find advanced indicators, some of the indicators issued by the leadership organs are outdated, and some waste a lot of manpower and financial resources in order to find advanced indicators. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant hopes that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry will, after comparing the advanced and unified standards of various plants, promptly prepare tables of the most advanced indicators and distribute them to the plants, in order to further stimulate everyone's enthusiasm and strive for the top. When comparing advanced units, the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory lacked comprehensive information on the quality of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, as well as cotton, yarn, and electricity consumption, making it difficult to compare. The factory director said that if the Ministry of Textile Industry could help them obtain advanced indicators in a timely manner, it would be of great help to their leap forward. For example, their weaving workshop originally planned to consume 94 kilowatt-hours of electricity per thousand meters of 21.23 twill fabric. This year, they planned to save 100,000 kilowatt-hours. When they learned that the national advanced level was 78 kilowatt-hours per thousand meters, they took measures to increase the electricity saving target to 150,000 kilowatt-hours. The factory said that the Ministry of Textile Industry's information in this regard is too old. For example, in terms of the consumption of major machine materials, the factory only received the figures completed by various factories in the third quarter of last year this month. They hope that the Ministry of Textile Industry will promptly notify relevant factories of the advanced indicators of cotton textiles nationwide using the fastest method.
    Some other types of factories have also made this request.

### 北京很多工厂向领导机关提出要求  及时把先进指标告诉基层

    北京很多工厂向领导机关提出要求
    及时把先进指标告诉基层
    新华社20日讯　北京很多工厂在比先进、学先进、赶先进中，希望有关领导机关帮助他们“互通情报”，以便克服不能及时找到先进指标找不到评比对象的困难，使革命干劲能够得到充分发挥。
    这些工厂职工的干劲很大，都想克服落后，赶上先进，但是他们有的找不到先进指标，有的领导机关发给的指标已经过时，有的为了找先进指标而浪费了很多人力、财力。石景山钢铁厂希望冶金工业部把各厂比先进以后的最先进的各项指标，在统一口径后，及时制表发给各厂，以便进一步激发大家的干劲，力争上游。国营北京第一棉纺织厂在比先进时，没有关于棉纱、棉布的质量和用棉、用纱、用电等方面的全面资料，感到很难比较。这个厂的厂长说，如果纺织工业部能够帮助他们及时得到先进指标，对于他们的跃进将极有帮助。如他们的织布车间原订织二一·二三斜纹布每千公尺用电九十四度，今年计划节约用电十万度，当他们知道全国先进水平是每千公尺用电七十八度，就采取措施把节约用电的指标提高到了十五万度。这个厂说，现在纺织工业部有关这方面的通报资料太旧，例如主要机物料消耗方面的情况，这个厂在本月份才收到各厂去年第三季度完成的数字。他们希望纺织工业部把全国棉纺织方面的先进指标用最迅速的方法，及时通告有关各厂。
    还有一些其他类型的工厂也提出了这种希望。
