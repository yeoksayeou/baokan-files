Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 14th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh stated at a civic welcome reception hosted by Rangoon Mayor U Ba Maung on the afternoon of the 14th, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people from South to North are determined to strive for the unification of their country on the basis of independence and democracy through peaceful means, in accordance with the Geneva Accords."
    He pointed out that foreign interference in the reunification of Vietnam "violates the Geneva Accords and infringes upon the sovereignty of Vietnam, hurting the feelings of the Vietnamese people."
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh emphasized, "With the solidarity of the entire Vietnamese people in the struggle, and with the support of the fraternal people of Burma and peace-loving people around the world, Vietnam will surely be reunified."
    Chairman Ho and his entourage, accompanied by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, attended the welcome reception hosted by Mayor U Ba Maung, along with more than 600 prominent figures from all walks of life in Rangoon.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh continued, "The struggle of the Vietnamese people is linked to the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries and the people of all countries in the world to eradicate the hateful and outdated colonialism."
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "Since the Second World War, the forces of peace have grown rapidly and continuously, and are now capable of preventing war." Asian and African countries are playing an increasingly important role in the world.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh stressed, "The Vietnamese people will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the Union of Burma, the people of Asian and African countries, and the peace-loving people of the world, to fight for the defense of peace. Final victory will surely belong to us."
    Mayor U Ba Maung said in his speech, "Now that our two countries have successfully broken free from the shackles of colonialism, thereby eliminating the artificial barriers that separated us, we firmly believe that the people of our two countries can look forward to an increasingly mutual respect, understanding, and friendly relationship in the future, and their cooperation will benefit both sides."
    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 14th: Rangoon public opinion welcomes the visit of Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Burma. All major newspapers today published photographs of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and his revolutionary deeds in the struggle against colonialism and for the independence of Vietnam.
    The "Eagle" newspaper published an editorial today saying that the Burmese people warmly welcome Chairman Ho Chi Minh to visit Burma because Chairman Ho Chi Minh and our Aung San, as well as the Burmese and Vietnamese people, once shared weal and woe in the struggle against colonialism in Asia.
    The newspaper pointed out that Vietnam has not yet been reunified due to Western interference. It said that the United States is doing everything possible to undermine the Geneva Accords and is creating discord between South and North Vietnam. At the same time, the United Kingdom and France, which signed the Geneva Accords, are "indifferent" to the issue of reunifying Vietnam, which is included in the agreement.
    The newspaper continued, whether it be the people of North or South Vietnam, they all hope for the reunification of Vietnam. If Vietnam continues to be divided, it will only bring greater difficulties and chaos to the people.
    "The New Era" newspaper also pointed out that despite many difficulties, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has accelerated the pace of economic development.

    胡志明主席在仰光市长招待会上表示
    越南人民坚决争取重新统一
    仰光报刊指出缅越在反殖民主义斗争中同舟共济
    据新华社仰光14日电　胡志明主席14日下午在仰光市长吴拉茂所主持的市民欢迎会上讲话时说，“越南民主共和国政府和从南到北的越南人民都坚决地争取按照日内瓦协定，通过和平途径在独立和民主的基础上统一他们的国家”。
    他指出，外国对越南重新统一的干涉“是违反日内瓦协定和侵犯越南主权的，它伤害了越南人民的感情”。
    胡志明主席着重指出，“有了越南全体人民在斗争中的团结一致，有了缅甸兄弟人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的支持，越南一定会重新统一。”
    胡主席和他的随行人员在缅甸总理吴努陪同下，出席了吴拉茂市长主持的欢迎会，出席欢迎会的还有仰光各界著名人士六百多人。
    胡志明主席接着指出，“越南人民的斗争同亚非各国人民和世界各国人民争取铲除可恨而又过时的殖民主义的斗争是联结在一起的”。
    胡志明主席说，“第二次世界大战以后，和平力量迅速地不断壮大，现在已经能够防止战争了。”亚非国家在世界上起着越来越重要的作用。
    胡志明强调指出，“越南人民将同缅甸联邦的人民、亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民肩并肩地站在一起，为保卫和平而奋斗。最后胜利一定属于我们”。
    吴拉茂市长在讲话中说，“现在我们两国既已成功地挣脱了殖民主义的桎梏，从而消除了阻隔我们的人为障碍，我们深信，我们两国人民可以展望，两国人民今后的关系将是愈来愈互相尊重、了解和友好的关系，他们的合作将使双方获得好处。”
    新华社仰光14日电　仰光舆论表示欢迎越南民主共和国主席胡志明访问缅甸。所有重要报纸今天都登载了胡志明主席的照片和他为反对殖民主义和为越南独立而斗争的革命事迹。
      “鹰报”今天发表社论说，缅甸人民热烈欢迎胡志明主席前来缅甸访问，因为胡志明主席和我们的昂山，以及缅甸人民和越南人民在反对亚洲殖民主义的斗争中曾经同舟共济。
    这家报纸指出，由于西方的干涉，越南至今还没有获得重新统一。它说，美国正在千方百计地破坏日内瓦协定，并且正在南越和北越之间制造不和。同时，在日内瓦协定上签了字的英法两国对包括在协定内的重新统一越南的问题“漠不关心”。
    这家报纸继续指出，无论北越或南越人民都希望越南重新统一。如果越南继续分裂下去，那只会给人民带来更大的困难和混乱。
    “新时代报”也指出，越南民主共和国尽管遇到很多困难，但是它却加快了经济发展的速度。
