　　At the Captain's Home
　　Qian Minyi
    The Will of Steel
    In the past, we were strangers; now, we carry our bedding together to the countryside...
    Sleeping at the small team leader's home, we share a bed and cover ourselves with the same quilt. In the dim lamplight, I discovered the scars on your legs and the bullet wound on your chest.
    Ah, so you are a demobilized soldier! Why have you kept it from me all along, refusing to tell me?
    Perhaps, when you were just a snot-nosed child, you followed the troops, carrying a small Mauser rifle, wearing an oversized uniform, tempered in the fires of battle, growing up in hardship...
    Perhaps, on the snowy Korean battlefield, you ambushed from shell craters, charged through the smoke of gunfire... It was there that your body was left with precious bullet wounds worth commemorating...
    You are a person who has rendered meritorious service to the people! And yet, you are always so approachable, amiable, and there is not a trace of pride flashing on your simple face.
    A good soldier always stands at the forefront of the battle. This time, you signed up to go to the countryside again. With your will of tempered steel, you will surely give it a good go in the struggle against nature!
    Warm Maternal Love
    In the evening, I returned from the fields. At the captain's home, I used a small wooden basin to wash the black mud clinging to the soles of my feet...
    Under the kerosene lamp, the captain's mother was mending my cotton coat, which had been torn by branches, stitch by stitch.
    Her weak eyes stared intently at the shining, fine needle tip. She sewed laboriously, stitch by stitch... How much warm maternal love flowed into my cotton coat; how much excited emotion gathered in my chest. It was as if I were living in my own home.
    Aren't those the bony fingers of a mother? Aren't those the kind eyes of a mother? Ah! Mother, whom I have been separated from for many years, your son has returned, returned to your side!
    I held my breath and watched her mend my cotton coat, until the even stitches had covered the surroundings of the hole; until the water in the small basin had cooled my heels, did I wake up...
    Ah! So I am at the captain's home!…

　　在队长家里
　　钱敏谊
    钢的意志
    过去，我们从不相识；如今，一道背着铺盖下乡……
    睡在小队长家里，我们合眠一个铺，同盖一条被。在微弱的灯光下，我发现了你腿上的疤痕，胸口的枪伤。
    啊，原来你是个复员军人！怎么你一直瞒着我，不肯对我讲？
    也许，当你还是个拖着鼻涕的孩子时，你就跟随在队伍上，背起一支小小的马枪，穿上宽大的军装，在战斗的烈火中熔炼，在苦难中成长……
    也许，在白雪皑皑的朝鲜战场，你在弹坑中伏击，在硝烟中冲锋……就在那里，你的躯体上留下了值得纪念的珍贵的枪伤……
    你是为人民立过功勋的人呵！而你，在我面前总是那样平易近人、和蔼可亲，淳朴的脸上没有一丝骄傲的闪光。
    一个好战士，永远站在战斗的最前列。这一次，你又报名下乡了。凭你那百炼成钢的意志，你准会在向大自然斗争中好好干它一场！
    温暖的母爱
    傍晚，我从地里回来。在队长家里，用一只小小的木盆，洗去脚板上沾着的乌黑的泥……
    在煤油灯下，队长的母亲一针一针地为我补衲着给树枝刺破的棉衣。
    无力的眼神，凝视着闪光的细细的针尖。艰难地缝着，一针一针地……多少温暖的母爱啊，流进了我的棉衣；多少激动的感情啊，凝聚在我的胸口。仿佛，我就是住在自己家里。
    那不是枯瘦的母亲的手指吗？那不是妈妈慈祥的眼光吗？呵！阔别多年的母亲，你的儿子又回来了，回到了你的身边！
    我屏息静气地看她为我补衲棉衣，直等到均匀的针线已爬满破洞的四周；直等到小盆里的水凉透了我的脚跟，我才苏醒过来。……
    呵！原来我是在队长家里！……
