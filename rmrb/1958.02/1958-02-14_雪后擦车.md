Title: Wiping Down the Train After Snow

It's really true what they say about "cold after snow." The day before yesterday, we had a heavy snowfall, and wow, today's cold is something else! As soon as my foot hit the platform, my shoe sole was frozen solid to the ground, and I had to shake it off with each step. And if you stepped on the iron footplate of the locomotive, you'd be stuck there for good.

But guess what in weather like this? None of us were "crabby." We grabbed our rags and wiped the locomotive even brighter and shinier. If you don't believe me, go take a look now. If you're not wearing clean clothes, you might end up getting our locomotive dirty instead! In the past, as soon as winter arrived, everyone was too lazy to wipe the trains. Unless it was a sunny day, and we weren't on duty during lunchtime and were stopped in the depot, we'd make an exception and wipe it down once. Back then, the trains were so dirty they looked like they'd grown fur. The copper bells, iron whistles, red wheels, and white trim were all the same color, covered in a thick layer of greasy yellow mud.

Ever since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, our enthusiasm has soared. That's right, what's so great about Britain? With our ambition, catching up with them wouldn't be difficult at all. Gradually, we not only hauled more and ran faster, but we also saved coal and paid extra attention to the maintenance of our locomotives. Because, to be honest, our locomotive is really old. It was scrapped during the Kuomintang era, but after liberation, it was brought back to life. We thought: If we're going to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, that means we'll have to use this locomotive for another fifteen years before we can switch to electric or diesel locomotives. But judging by its current condition, that's a big problem. It's up to us to maintain it well and extend its lifespan. And wiping down the train is a very important part of locomotive maintenance, so everyone decided that from now on, no one is allowed to be afraid of the cold, we must wipe and keep the locomotive clean.

One day, we were pulling a train that had to stop at a small station for over an hour to allow another train to pass. The weather had cleared up, so we started wiping the train. Many farmers came to see the locomotive, pointing and chatting excitedly. Suddenly, one of them said, "You have to give it to the worker comrades. I get a toothache just looking at that cold iron thing, but they're wiping it so cheerfully. If they keep working like that, they'll probably catch up with Britain in ten years."

Hearing his words, I felt a strange sensation in my heart, a bit of shame, but then I thought it was an encouragement and a spur. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that his words were extraordinary for us. It made me realize that wiping the train wasn't just about keeping the locomotive clean, it also showed whether we were truly putting in the revolutionary effort to overtake Britain. And this symbol not only had an impact on us within the railway system, but it also had such a big leading role for the farmers.

When I got back, I told everyone about it. After listening to me, they couldn't stay calm. They immediately established a rule: whoever goes off shift must wipe the train clean; if it's not clean, the next shift has the right to refuse to take over.

Later, when we received a coal-saving bonus, none of us agreed to split the money. We all agreed to buy paint to paint the train. This turned our locomotive around! The red was red, the white was white, the copper bell gleamed like gold, and the connecting rod shone like it was electroplated. If someone didn't know better, they would surely think it was a new train. After this makeover, the train really became like a bride. If you have time, you won't be able to find anyone in the driver's cab, they're either under the train or on top of the boiler wiping the train.

Take this morning, for example. It was truly the coldest day of the year, but that didn't stop us. We brought a small bucket and shoveled in a few scoops of fire, warming ourselves while wiping. The more we worked, the hotter we got, and we forgot about the cold. Seeing the layer of oily dirt disappear from the locomotive, we started singing to cheer ourselves on. I, for one, cleverly adapted the lyrics from the opera "Liu Hulan" and sang it. If you want to hear it, I'll hum a couple of lines with my terrible voice for you: In the bitter cold of winter, heavy snow is falling, though the weather is cold, our hearts are warm, we pull our long, long train, speeding forward, to leave Britain behind, hey-ho hey-ho hey-ho, to leave Britain behind…

    雪后擦车
    邯郸市铁路机务段副司机　杨振昆
    “雪后寒”这句话可真不假哟，前天下了场大雪，呵，今天那个冷劲就甭提了，脚刚落在道台上，鞋底就跟石头子沾冻在一块了，迈一步还得甩一下。要是蹬在机车底铁脚蹬板上，那沾住你就连窝也动不了啦。
    就这样的天你猜怎么着？我们哥儿们谁也没“醋”，抓起破布把机车擦的更明更亮。不信你现在瞧瞧去，要不穿干净衣服，说不定你倒反会把我们机车给蹭脏了呢！在往年，只要入冬，就都懒得擦车了，除非赶上个晴天，还得中午没担当任务停在段里了，那算破例地擦上一回。那会儿车脏的简直像长了毛一样，什么铜铃铁笛呀、红轱辘白边呀，全一色，满是油黄油黄的厚厚一层泥。
    自打党中央提出十五年赶上英国的号召以后，我们哥儿们劲头就上来了，是嘛，英国他有什么了不起，就凭咱们这志气，赶上他还是什么费难的事。渐渐的我们不单拉的多、跑的快，还节省用煤，对机车保养也分外的重视多了。因为我们这台车说起来，已经是老掉牙的了，原来在国民党时期报了废的，解放后才死车复了活。我们想：要在十五年之后赶上英国，就是说要我们再用这台车十五年，才能换电气或内燃机车，可是要照现在的质量看来，问题可就大了，怎样保养好延长这台机车的寿命，就看我们的了。而擦车，是保养机车中一项很重要的工作，所以大伙儿就决定今后谁也不许怕冷，一定要擦、保持机车清洁。
    有一天，我们拉的列车在一个小站上会车要停一个多小时，天才转晴，我们就擦起车来。有好些个农民都来看火车头，指手画脚的聊的挺热闹。突然不知其中的哪位说了这么一句：“还得说工人老大哥呀，我见了那冷冰的铁东西牙根都觉得着扎着痛，可人家却还擦的那么欢。要照人家这样干劲，怕十年也就赶上英国了。”
    听了他这句话，不知怎的在我心里起了种异样的感觉，有点惭愧，继而一想又觉得是一种鼓励和鞭策。越想越感到这句话对我们说来，实在太不平常，它使我不禁感到我们擦车绝不光是机车干净干净就完了，它还标志出了我们是不是真正拿出了革命的干劲去赶过英国了；而这个标志不仅对我们铁路内部有影响，它对农民也有着那么大的带头作用。
    回来我就把这件事跟大伙说了，他们听完我的话全沉不住气了，登时就订出了个制度：交班必须把车擦干净；不干净，接班的有权不接车。
    后来开了节煤奖金，哥几个谁也不同意分着花喽，一致通过买油漆漆车。这一来我们这台车可翻了身啦，红的红喽，白的白喽，铜铃摩的闪闪发金光，连杆蹭的像电镀的一样，要是不知道底的人，保准当成了新车看。这一番修饰，车真成了新娘子了。有空你看吧，在司机室里你算甭打算找到人，不是钻到车底下就是上了锅炉去擦车了。
    就还拿今天早晨来说吧，那可真算今年最冷的天了，那也没降住我们，我们提了个小桶，里面铲上几锹火，边烤边擦。这样越干越热，也就忘了冷了。眼看着机车上的那层浮油土星没了，便唱起歌来助兴。我呢，就别出心裁地按歌剧刘胡兰里的调，编了词唱起来，要听我就用我这蹩脚的嗓子给你哼两句你来听听吧：数九那个寒天刮大雪，天气那个虽冷心里热，我们那拉着、长长的列车、向前奔，要把那英国甩在后边，哎嗨哎嗨哎嗨哟，要把那英国甩在后边……。
