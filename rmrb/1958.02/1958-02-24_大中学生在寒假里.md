Shanghai Students Have Rich and Colorful Activities
	This newspaper's special New China News Agency dispatch: Many college students in Shanghai are actively participating in various work-study programs and voluntary labor during their winter vacation.

	The Department of Aquaculture at Shanghai Fisheries College has sent a group of students to participate in the fishery measurement work at the state-owned Gaoqiao Aquaculture Farm. According to the contract, a large number of students from the Department of Aquaculture and the Department of Aquatic Product Processing will soon go to Gaoqiao to help the aquaculture farm clear and renovate ponds. Students from the Department of Marine Fisheries have begun to help with earthmoving at the basic construction site of the nearby Shanghai Cable Factory.

	More than 20 fourth-year students from the Industrial and Civil Architecture major of the Structural Engineering Department and the Architecture major of the Architecture Department of Tongji University have participated in small-scale design and drawing work at an architectural design institute during their winter vacation. Some third- and fourth-year students from the Road and Bridge Department and the Railway Department went to factories and enterprises to work temporarily on drawing mechanical part drawings and designing small internal transportation railways for factories.

	Some students at Jiaotong University have begun to participate in labor at the school's practice factory and repair shop. They have already made more than 100 hammers in the fitter's workshop. Some students who have been promoted from secondary technical schools have begun to repair more than 30 machines in the school. Teachers in the Transportation and Hoisting Department are also leading students to repair the school's locomotives.

	Since the beginning of the winter vacation, students from various departments of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music have performed nine慰问 performances in factories, rural areas, and military units. The students performed small operas reflecting current life, such as "Frugal Housekeeping" and "Returning After Graduation," as well as orchestral music, choruses, and performance songs, which were warmly welcomed everywhere.

	The work-study activities and voluntary labor of various universities and colleges in Shanghai during the winter vacation are diverse. In addition to activities related to their majors, some students participated in service labor such as stencil printing, binding lecture notes, blueprinting, organizing books, repairing playgrounds, hairdressing, and sewing on campus. Some students became temporary food company salespersons, bus ticket sellers, public place supervisors, porters, and packaging workers. More than 200 students from East China Textile Engineering Institute participated in a week of agricultural labor in suburban agricultural cooperatives. Tongji University has allocated 100 mu of vacant land on campus to students in each class for cultivation. Currently, some of the vacant land has been plowed and planted with vegetables.

	Currently, student unions or Communist Youth League committees in many universities and colleges in Shanghai have added work-study departments to coordinate students' work-study activities. Some of these activities during the winter vacation are voluntary, while others are low-paying. According to the opinions of the students, each school temporarily allocates all or most of the labor income to the collective, primarily to help students with financial difficulties.

	20,000 Chongqing Students Support Water Conservancy Construction
	This dispatch: The first batch of over 20,000 out of more than 40,000 college and middle school students in Chongqing have gone to the countryside during their winter vacation to participate in agricultural labor and support the great leap forward in agricultural production.

	As soon as the exams in various schools ended, applications for going to the countryside to work, letters of challenge, and letters of response poured in like snowflakes, setting off a burst of cheers for "laboring through the winter vacation."

	The first batch of more than 20,000 students has already begun intensive labor in the cold fields of the suburbs. In water conservancy construction, they are not afraid of the cold or difficulties. Many people are digging soil barefoot in the muddy water, and they do not stop working even on snowy days. The 161 students of Chongqing No. 1 Machinery Manufacturing School dug and filled 380 cubic meters of soil for embankments on the first day of labor. More than 600 students from Chongqing Statistics School completed the workload of more than 1,000 labor days of farmers in three days and ensured quality. Students from Chongqing Normal School also plan to help farmers in Beibei build a large reservoir that can irrigate 1,500 mu of paddy fields and 250 mu of dry land. Students from Chongqing No. 3 Middle School will repair three weirs and dig a large fish pond with an area of 50 mu in ten days. Students from Chongqing Water Conservancy School not only participate in labor in the suburbs but also plan to go to Fuling, Jiangjin, and other special districts to help farmers with comprehensive water conservancy planning and construction technical guidance. During their labor life, the students also proposed conventions to ensure that they eat and live with the farmers, share weal and woe, and oppose special treatment. Some students also put forward the slogan: "Eat dry food when working, eat thin porridge when idle, eat more cheap vegetables, and eat less expensive vegetables." The students have established a deep friendship with the farmers through this spirit of hard work and revolutionary drive. Many farmers have said, "We welcome intellectuals like you!"

	During the gaps in labor, the students also organized visits to farmers, participated in rural meetings, helped farmers eliminate the four pests, and held recreational gatherings with farmers. Students who have lived in the city for a long time have personally contacted the hard-working and simple farmers, witnessed the superiority of collectivization, and universally improved their ideological awareness by combining their studies with the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Students from the Railway Transportation School who went to the countryside participated in the settlement meeting of the Third Agricultural Cooperative of Mawang Township and personally saw the fact that the income of each member of the cooperative increased, and concretely recognized the superiority of agricultural collectivization.

    重庆两万学生支援水利建设
    本报讯　重庆市四万多名大中学生第一批二万名已在寒假中下乡参加农业劳动，支援农业生产大跃进。
    各个学校考试刚结束，要求下乡劳动的申请书，挑战、应战书便如雪片飞来，掀起一片“劳动过寒假”的欢呼声。
    第一批下乡的二万多名学生，已经在郊区严寒的田野上开始紧张的劳动了。他们在兴修水利中，不畏寒冷，不怕艰难，很多人赤足在泥水中挖土，下雪天也不停工。重庆第一机械制造学校的一百六十一个学生，第一天劳动就挖土填堤三百八十立方公尺。重庆统计学校六百多学生在三天内完成了农民一千多劳动日的工作量，并且保证了质量。重庆师范学校学生还计划要帮助北碚农民修建一个可以灌溉一千五百亩水田和二百五十亩旱地的大水库。重庆第三中学学生要在十天内修好三个堰塘和挖掘一个五十亩面积的大鱼池。重庆水利学校的学生不仅在郊区参加劳动，还计划到涪陵、江津等专区去帮助农民作全面水利规划和施工技术指导。学生们在劳动生活中还互相提出公约，保证与农民同吃同住，同甘共苦，反对特殊化。有的学校的学生还提出口号：“出工吃干的，闲时吃稀的，多吃便宜菜，少吃贵重菜”。学生们通过这种吃苦耐劳的精神和革命干劲与农民建立起了深厚的友谊，很多农民反映说：“像你们这样的知识分子，我们很欢迎！”
    下乡学生在劳动空隙时还组织了访问农民、参加农村会议，帮助农民除四害以及与农民举行文娱联欢等活动。长期生活在城市的学生亲身接触了勤劳朴实的农民，亲眼看见了合作化的优越性，结合学习全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），思想觉悟普遍提高。铁路运输学校下乡学生参加了马王乡第三农业社的结算大会，亲眼看见这个社每个社员的收入增加的事实，具体认识到了农业合作化的优越性。
