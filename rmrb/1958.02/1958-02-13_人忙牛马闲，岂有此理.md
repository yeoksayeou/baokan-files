From various newspapers:

	It's Absurd That People Are Busy While Cattle and Horses Are Idle
	The Yunnan Daily’s headline on the 4th was very eye-catching: "It's Absurd That People Are Busy While Cattle and Horses Are Idle!? Let Idle Cattle and Horses Pull Carts and Carry Things." The content stated that Jinning County has about 10,000 head of large livestock such as cattle and horses. In the past, because people were not used to it, a large number of cattle and horses were idle most of the time, except for stepping on manure and plowing fields for one or two months. People were very busy, and there was a shortage of labor. During the great leap forward in agricultural production, the Shangsuan and Liujie cooperatives discovered this potential – using cattle and horses for transportation work. After the county party committee discovered this, it promptly organized cadres from various townships and cooperatives to visit and promote it. After the cadres took the lead in herding cattle, and the masses discussed and compared, and solved the specific difficulties of livestock equipment and transportation tools, more and more cattle and horses are now being used, and the efficiency of accumulating fertilizer has been greatly improved. The original "not being used to it" has become "being used to it."

### 人忙牛马闲，岂有此理

    人忙牛马闲，岂有此理
    4日的云南日报头条题目非常引人注意：“人忙牛马闲，岂有此理！？让闲牛闲马拉车驮东西”。内容是说晋宁全县有牛马大牲畜约一万头左右，但过去由于群众不习惯，大批牛马除了踩踩粪、犁一两个月的田而外，大部分时间都是闲着；人却很忙，而且劳动力不够用。在农业生产大跃进中，上蒜和六街两个合作社挖出了这个潜力——把牛马用于运输工作。县委发现后，及时组织各乡、社干部参观，加以推广。经过干部带头吆牛、群众讨论对比，并解决了牲口装备和运输工具的具体困难后，现在使用起来的牛马越来越多，积肥效率大大提高。原来的“不习惯”变成了“习惯”。
