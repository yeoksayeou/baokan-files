Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 13th: A Syrian military spokesman said today that the Syrian authorities arrested a group of infiltrators this morning who had been trained by colonialists to seek opportunities to harm the Arab people.

The spokesman said that interrogations of these infiltrators have begun, and they will be submitted to the court for punishment.

The spokesman pointed out that colonialists, Zionists, and the Baghdad Pact organization are not satisfied with the union of Egypt and Syria, "therefore they began to cooperate with their agents to plot conspiracies in order to tie this part of the Arab nation to the chariot of the (Baghdad) Pact. They held meetings one after another. However, the actions of the legal institutions were faster than them."

"Al-Ra'i al-'Amm" newspaper published a special edition on the evening of the 13th, carrying detailed information about the new conspiracy smashed that day. According to this newspaper, this new conspiracy was planned at the Baghdad Pact's Ankara conference, and then organized in Ankara, Amman, and Beirut.

This newspaper said that the United States provided weapons and funds to the conspirators. It also said that the United States provided nearly one million US dollars for this new conspiracy.

This newspaper further said that the basic content of this conspiracy was to launch armed disturbances in various places near the Syrian border on the day of the Syrian people's referendum (February 21st), in order to find an excuse for imperialism to cross the borders of Jordan and Turkey to carry out military intervention against Syria.

This newspaper said that dozens of people have been arrested and their weapons have been confiscated. The public security forces also confiscated some cash and documents, which proved the connection between the conspirators and their masters in Ankara, Amman, and Beirut.

This newspaper said that at the same time, the imperialists also ordered their Turkish and Israeli accomplices to concentrate troops on the Syrian border. This newspaper said that the military authorities knew all the details of these troop concentrations forty-eight hours ago and made arrangements to prepare for any aggression.

The investigation is continuing.

    坚决粉碎殖民主义者的颠覆阴谋
    叙利亚破获一批武装特务
    美国向阴谋分子提供了武器和经费
    新华社大马士革13日电　叙利亚军方发言人今天说，叙利亚有关当局在今天上午拘捕了一批渗入分子，这些分子是由殖民主义者训练来伺机谋害阿拉伯人民的。
    发言人说，已经开始对这些渗入分子进行审讯，他们将提交法庭惩处。
    发言人指出，殖民主义者、犹太复国主义和巴格达条约组织都不满意埃及和叙利亚的联合，“因此他们开始同他们的代理人合作，策划阴谋，以便把阿拉伯民族的这个部分绑上（巴格达）条约的战车。他们接连地举行了会议。但是法律机构的行动比他们更快。”
    “舆论报”13日晚上发行特刊登载了当天破获的新阴谋的详细情况。据这家报纸说，这次新阴谋是在巴格达条约安卡拉会议上策划的，然后在安卡拉、安曼和贝鲁特加以组织。
    这家报纸说，美国向阴谋分子提供了武器和经费。它又说，美国为这一新阴谋提供了将近一百万美元。
    这家报纸又说，这次阴谋的基本内容是在叙利亚人民举行公民投票的那一天（2月21日）在叙利亚边境附近各地发动武装骚动，以便为帝国主义越过约旦和土耳其边境对叙利亚进行军事干涉找寻借口。
    这家报纸说，被捕的有几十个人，他们的武器已经被没收。公安部队还没收了一些现款和文件，这些东西证明阴谋分子同他们在安卡拉、安曼和贝鲁特的主子们之间的联系。
    这家报纸说，与此同时，帝国主义者还命令他们的土耳其和以色列帮凶把军队集中在叙利亚边境上。这家报纸说，军事当局在四十八小时以前就知道了这些部队集中的全部情况，并且作好安排准备应付任何侵略行动。
    调查工作在继续进行中。
