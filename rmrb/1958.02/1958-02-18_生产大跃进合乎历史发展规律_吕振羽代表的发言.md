The current socialist production Great Leap Forward unfolding in our country is formed on the basis of the great victory achieved in the socialist revolution carried out on the political and ideological fronts after the resolution of the issue of ownership of the means of production, and on the basis of the greatly enhanced socialist consciousness and construction enthusiasm of the masses. It is entirely in accordance with the objective laws of historical development.

At this congress, after listening to the reports from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council, I feel very excited, satisfied, and greatly encouraged. The report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen demonstrates that the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has faithfully fulfilled the entrustment of the people and the congress, and has achieved great success. The report by Director Wu Yuzhang explains the necessity and inevitability of Chinese character reform. The State Council's correct policy and cautious, thorough steps in simplifying current Chinese characters and formulating the Chinese phonetic alphabet also explain the tasks and roles of this plan. Among the more than 600 million people currently using the Chinese language, including the Han people and fraternal ethnic groups such as the Manchus and Huis who use the same language, the formal adoption and implementation of this plan will have a tremendous impact on unifying pronunciation, promoting Mandarin, eliminating illiteracy, popularizing and improving the scientific and cultural level of the working people, as well as on the creation and reform of writing systems for several fraternal ethnic groups in the country, and will have a profound impact on our socialist construction and communist cause. The reports by Vice Premiers Li and Bo are mutually adaptable and specifically represent a complete system of our national financial and economic plan; they faithfully reflect the good situation of the implementation and completion of the 1957 national budget and national economic plan, laying a good foundation for the 1958 national budget and national economic plan. The 1958 national budget and national economic plan both realistically implement the Party's correct principles on socialist construction, fully reflecting the situation of the socialist production Great Leap Forward; the large increase in production investment and the large decrease in expenditures on defense and administration indicate our peaceful construction policy and our great peaceful policy in international affairs, and also reflect that the development of the international situation is favorable to our side, that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind; it also reflects our spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily and the improvement of administrative efficiency, which boils down to the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. This will greatly encourage the revolutionary spirit of the people throughout the country. Therefore, I suggest that the congress adopt the above four reports and make corresponding resolutions.

The new upsurge of agricultural socialism and the increasingly expanding and deepening socialist production Great Leap Forward that has emerged throughout the country since the winter of 1957 is a revolutionary situation that is bound to arrive on the basis of the great victory of the socialist revolution. Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out in the "Preface" to "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" that this situation is about to arrive. The new relations of production established due to the victory of the revolution are suitable for the requirements of the development of productive forces. Therefore, in human history, the slave system revolution, the feudalism revolution, and the capitalism revolution, after they achieved victory, also brought about a situation of production leap forward, so that social production obtained development. However, because those revolutions were only victories of the exploiting classes, and could not solve the contradictions between production and the slave owner, feudal lord, or capitalist ownership of the means of production, the situation of production leap forward they could cause and the scale of their development were limited to a certain extent, and with the development of their production, they were bound to bring about contradictions that they themselves could not overcome. Only the victory of the socialist revolution fundamentally solves the contradiction between social production and the ownership of the means of production, that is, the replacement of private ownership by public ownership of the means of production, and thereby gives appropriate arrangements and solutions to those fundamental contradictions in its superstructure, can there be a situation of production Great Leap Forward that is as surging, magnificent, and increasingly expanding and deepening as our country currently has. Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto": "The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. Proletarians have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property." At the same time, only on the basis of the socialist system can people consciously and purposefully recognize, grasp, and follow objective laws, replace spontaneous processes with conscious activities, make the relations of production suitable for the growth of productive forces, and continuously increase and improve social production to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.

After the victory of the People's Great Revolution in our country, until the rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists in 1957, we experienced five major movements and three major transformations. The transition from the People's Great Revolution to the socialist revolution adopted an unprecedented method of peaceful transition, and was carried out according to the general line put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong. The issue of ownership of the means of production was mainly resolved through the three major transformations: the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the socialist transformation of handicrafts. This method of peaceful transformation was not only greatly beneficial to the working class and the working people, but also very convenient for the bourgeoisie.

The socialist revolution is to eliminate capitalism and other historical relations of production and establish socialist relations of production, proletarian dictatorship and overthrowing the bourgeoisie... The victory of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements only solved the problem that the capitalist economy must accept the leadership of the socialist economy, and only gave a heavy blow to the five poisonous behaviors of the bourgeoisie, but did not solve the problem of ownership of the means of production. The victory of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce fundamentally solved the problem of ownership of the means of production, that is, the capitalists, in addition to receiving fixed interest, turned all the means of production they owned into the ownership of the whole people. The ideological reform movement of self-education and self-transformation of intellectuals only basically cleared away the counter-revolutionary thoughts of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and drew a clear line between the thoughts of the working class and the thoughts of the bourgeoisie. After several years of political study and practical life training, the broad masses of intellectuals have made great progress in politics and ideology, but most of the bourgeois intellectuals have not yet transformed into working-class intellectuals. Although our country's peaceful transition of the socialist revolution only wants to transform the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals into laborers and working-class intellectuals; however, the demise of an exploiting class will never be so calm and peaceful, and they are willing to be so calm and satisfied, so although it is the "general trend", some people inevitably regret that they cannot move the Yangtze River Bridge to their homes. Therefore, from some corners of society, and even from within the Communist Party, there emerged bourgeois rightists who opposed the Party, opposed the people, and opposed socialism, and attempted to restore capitalism. They colluded from within and without, and formed organized and planned conspiracy activities and rampant attacks. Through the form of the mass debate of great airing, great blooming, great contending, and big-character posters, the rectification movement and the struggle against the rightists that unfolded from 1957 was a great socialist revolution carried out on the ideological front and the political front. This has also won victory so far.

On the other hand, the land reform movement that we carried out and thoroughly completed after the victory of the People's Great Revolution only changed the feudal landlord class's occupation of land into the ownership of the peasants. Liberating the peasants from the basis of feudal shackles does not belong to the category of socialist revolution. It does not solve the problem between the socialist or capitalist roads. After the socialist transformation of agriculture and the agricultural socialist upsurge in 1956, the ownership of the means of production of individual small producers was changed into the collective ownership of advanced agricultural cooperatives, which fundamentally solved the problem of ownership of the means of production. However, the masses have not completely solved the problem in terms of ideological understanding, and socialism has not yet become a habit for them; at the same time, there are inevitably some spontaneous capitalist tendencies and sprouts. The remnant counter-revolutionaries and bourgeois rightists vainly attempted to use this loophole to oppose socialist cooperativization. The situation of the socialist transformation of handicrafts and its victory is basically the same. The unprecedented large-scale socialist education and rectification of cooperatives carried out among the broad masses not only greatly improved the socialist consciousness of the masses, and the firm confidence in socialist cooperativization, but also improved leadership and improved work; and combined with rectification and airing, it launched a hot upsurge of accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy in the masses, which converged into the new upsurge of agricultural socialism throughout the country since last winter. The socialist transformation of agriculture and the socialist transformation of handicrafts can achieve victory in a relatively short period of time because the broad masses of toiling peasants and handicraftsmen in our country need socialism, because they have a long-term alliance relationship with the Chinese working class, and because they have been fighting and liberated under the leadership of the Party for a long time, and so on.

The socialist production Great Leap Forward situation that has already arrived and will be more fully and deeply unfolded is formed on the basis of the great victory achieved in the socialist revolution carried out on the political and ideological fronts after the resolution of the issue of ownership of the means of production, and on the basis of the greatly enhanced socialist consciousness and construction enthusiasm of the masses. It is entirely in accordance with the objective laws of historical development. We can confidently catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products such as steel within fifteen years. The objective laws of history, the correct leadership of the Party based on objective laws, and the revolutionary spirit of the people throughout the country are extremely strong guarantees.

Please correct me if the above opinions are not appropriate.

    生产大跃进合乎历史发展规律
    吕振羽代表的发言
    目前我国正在展开的社会主义生产大跃进，是在继生产资料所有制问题解决后，又在政治战线上和思想战线上所进行的社会主义革命获得伟大胜利的基础上形成的，是在群众的社会主义觉悟和建设热忱大大提高的基础上形成的，是完全合乎历史发展的客观规律的。
    这次大会上，我们听了人大常委会和国务院的各项报告，我感到很兴奋、很满意，也受到极大的鼓舞。彭真副委员长的报告，表明了人大常委会的工作，忠实地完成了人民和大会的付托，获得巨大成绩。吴玉章主任的报告，说明了汉字改革的必要和不可避免，国务院对现行汉字的简化和制订汉语拼音方案所采取的正确方针和慎重、周到的步骤，也说明了这个方案的任务和作用。现今使用汉语汉文的六亿多人口中，包括汉人及与汉人使用同一语文的满、回等兄弟民族人民。这个方案的正式通过和推行，对统一读音、推广普通话、扫除文盲、普及和提高劳动人民的科学文化水平，以及对国内若干兄弟民族创制和改革文字等等方面，均将产生巨大的作用和影响，对我国社会主义建设和共产主义事业将产生深远影响。李、薄两位副总理的报告，是相互适应的，具体表现了我国财政、经济计划的一个完密体系；忠实地反映了我国一九五七年度国家预算与国民经济计划的执行和完成的良好情况，为一九五八年度国家预算与国民经济计划打下了良好基础。一九五八年度的国家预算与国民经济计划，都实事求是地贯彻党关于社会主义建设的正确原则，充分反映出社会主义生产大跃进的形势；生产投资的大量增加和国防、行政费支出的大量减少，表明了我国的和平建设方针和在国际事务中的伟大和平政策，也反映出国际形势的发展有利于我们方面，是东风压倒西风；还反映了我们勤俭建国的精神和行政效率的提高，归结为社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的无比优越性。这将大大鼓舞全国人民的革命干劲。因此，我建议大会通过上述四个报告，并作出相应的决议。
    从一九五七年冬季以来，在全国范围涌现的农业社会主义新高潮和日益扩大、深入的社会主义生产大跃进的形势，是在社会主义革命的伟大胜利的基础上，必然到来的革命形势。毛泽东主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”的“序言”中，已指出这种形势将要到来。由于革命的胜利而建立起来的新的生产关系，适合于生产力发展的要求。所以在人类历史上的奴隶制度革命、封建主义革命、资本主义革命，在其获得胜利后，也都到来了生产跃进的形势，使社会生产获得发展。但由于那些革命都只是剥削阶级的胜利，都不能解决生产和生产资料的奴主、封主或资本家所有制间的矛盾，其所能引起的生产跃进的形势和其开展的规模，都是有一定局限的，而且随着其生产的发展，又必然带来其本身无法克服的矛盾。只有社会主义革命的胜利，根本解决了社会生产和生产资料所有制间的矛盾，即由生产资料的公有制代替了私有制，并从而给予其上层建筑方面的那些带根本性质的矛盾以适当的安排和解决，才能出现像我国目前这样汹涌澎湃、波澜壮阔的、日益扩大、深入的生产大跃进的形势。马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中说过：“无产者却只有消灭自己现时的占有方式，亦即消灭迄今存在的全部占有方式，才能夺得社会生产力。无产者自己没有什么必须保护的东西，他们必须打破迄今所有一切保护和保障过私有财产权的东西。”同时，也只有在社会主义制度的基础上，人们才能自觉地、有目的地去认识、掌握、依据客观法则，以自觉的活动去代替自发过程，使生产关系适合于生产力的增长，使社会生产不断增长与不断完善，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    我国在人民大革命胜利后，到一九五七年的整风运动和反资产阶级右派的斗争以前，共经历了五大运动和三大改造。由人民大革命转入到社会主义革命，是采取了史无前例的和平转变方式，是按党中央和毛泽东主席所提出的总路线进行的。生产资料所有制问题，主要是通过私营工商业的社会主义改造、农业社会主义改造、手工业的社会主义改造这三大改造去解决的。这种和平改造的方式，既大有利于工人阶级和劳动人民，对资产阶级也是很便当的。
    社会主义革命，是消灭资本主义及历史上的其他生产关系和建立社会主义生产关系，无产阶级专政和推翻资产阶级……。三反五反运动的胜利，只解决了资本主义经济必须接受社会主义经济领导的问题，只是给了资产阶级的五毒行为以沉重打击，还不是解决生产资料所有制的问题。私营工商业的社会主义改造的胜利，才基本上解决了生产资料所有制的问题，即资本家除拿定息外，把其所有的生产资料变成全民所有。知识分子的自我教育和自我改造的思想改造运动，也只是基本上肃清帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义等反革命思想，划清工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的界限，又经过其后数年间的政治学习和实际生活的锻炼，广大知识分子在政治和思想上有了很大进步，但资产阶级知识分子大都还没有转变成为工人阶级的知识分子。我国社会主义革命的和平转变，虽然对资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子也只是要改造成为劳动者和工人阶级知识分子；但是一个剥削阶级的灭亡，总不会那样风平浪静，都肯那样心平气服，所以虽然是“大势所趋”，仍不免有人怅恨于不能把长江大桥搬到他家里去。所以从社会的某些角落，甚至从共产党内，出现了反党反人民反社会主义，妄图使资本主义复辟的资产阶级右派分子，他们里应外合，并形成为有组织有计划的阴谋活动和猖狂进攻。通过大鸣、大放、大争、大字报等全民大辩论的形式，从一九五七年展开的整风运动和反右派斗争，是在思想战线上和政治战线上所进行的伟大社会主义革命。这到目前，也赢得了胜利。
    另方面，我们在人民大革命胜利后所进行并彻底完成了的土地改革运动，只是将封建地主阶级的土地占有改变为农民所有。把农民从封建束缚的基础上解放出来，还不是属于社会主义革命的范畴，它并没有解决社会主义或资本主义两条道路之间的问题。经过农业的社会主义改造和一九五六年的农业社会主义高潮，把个体小生产者的生产资料所有制改变成为高级农业合作社的集体所有制，才基本上解决了生产资料所有制的问题。但群众在思想认识上还没有完全解决问题，社会主义对于他们也还没成为习惯；同时，又不可避免地有着一些自发的资本主义倾向和萌芽。残余反革命分子和资产阶级右派，便妄图利用这种空子来反对社会主义合作化。手工业的社会主义改造和它的胜利，情况基本上也是这样。在广大群众中进行的空前规模的社会主义教育和整社工作，不只大大提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，对社会主义合作化的坚强信心，也提高了领导、改进了工作；而且结合整改和鸣放，就在群众中掀起了热火朝天的积肥和兴修水利的高潮，汇成为去冬以来全国范围的农业社会主义新高潮。农业社会主义改造和手工业社会主义改造能够在较短时期内取得胜利，由于我国广大的劳苦农民和手工业者群众需要社会主义，由于他们和中国工人阶级有着长时期的同盟关系，由于他们长期在党的领导下进行斗争和获得解放等等。
    目前已经到来，并行将更全面更深入地展开的社会主义生产大跃进形势，是在继生产资料所有制问题解决后，又在政治战线上和思想战线上所进行的社会主义革命获得伟大胜利的基础上形成的，是在群众的社会主义觉悟和建设热忱大大提高的基础上形成的，是完全合乎历史发展的客观规律的。我们能够信心百倍地，于十五年内，在炼钢等主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国，历史的客观规律、依据客观规律的党的正确领导和全国人民的革命干劲，就是极强有力的保证。
    以上意见是否妥当，请各位代表指正。
