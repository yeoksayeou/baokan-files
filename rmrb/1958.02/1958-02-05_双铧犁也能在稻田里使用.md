　　Double-Share Plows Can Also Be Used in Paddy Fields
    Double-wheel double-share plows were originally agricultural tools for cultivating dry land, but after modification, they can also be used in some paddy fields. Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have all conducted modification experiments. The results of the experiments are: they can be used without modification in rice paddies (fields with water, but neither people, cattle, nor plows sink into the field). In shallow mud-foot paddy fields (mud-foot depth of 20 to 30 centimeters), they can also be used with only partial modification.

    The so-called partial modification, taking Zhejiang Province as an example, mainly involves changing the iron wheels to hollow, wide wooden wheels, and also slightly modifying the plow moldboard and plowshare. After the wheels are modified, the contact area between the wheels and the soil increases, the pressure borne by the unit area of the soil decreases, and the degree of wheel sinking is reduced. The method of modifying wheels in Anhui is different from that in Zhejiang and other places. They install wooden pontoons under the iron wheels, using this method to overcome the problem of wheel sinking.

    After attaching a rice root cutting shovel to the double-wheel double-share plow, it can also be used to eliminate overwintering rice borers hidden in the rice roots. According to experiments by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, one person and one animal can shovel rice roots on fifteen mu per day. When the field surface is flat and the soil moisture is moderate, the proportion of striped rice borers killed by this method accounts for about 65% to 85% of the total number of borers in the cut rice roots.

### 双铧犁也能在稻田里使用

　　双铧犁也能在稻田里使用
    双轮双铧犁原来是耕旱地的农具，但是经过改装，也可以在一些水田里使用。浙江、广东、湖北和安徽等省都作过改装的试验。试验的结果是：在稻板田（田里虽有水，但人、牛、犁在田里都不下陷）不经改装就可以使用。在浅泥脚的水田（泥脚深度二十到三十公分）里，只要经过局部改装也能使用。
    所谓局部改装，以浙江省说，主要是把铁轮改为空心宽木轮，同时在犁壁、犁铧上略加改变。轮子经过改装以后，轮子和土壤的接触面增加了，土壤单位面积所承受的压力减轻了，轮子下陷的程度就缩小了。安徽改装轮子的方法和浙江等地不同，它们是在铁轮下安装上木拖船，用这种办法克服轮子下陷的毛病。
    双轮双铧犁附装上切稻根铲以后还可以用来消灭稻根中潜藏的过冬螟虫。据华东农业科学研究所试验，一人一畜每天可铲稻根十五市亩。在田面平整和土壤湿度适中的情况下，用这种办法杀死的三化螟虫约占被切割稻根中螟虫总数的65％—85％。
