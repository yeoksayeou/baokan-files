　　This newspaper reports: According to the Anhui Daily, the enlarged meeting held by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee on January 28, addressing the current development of water conservancy construction, put forward a new goal for this spring's farmland water conservancy construction. That is, the pace should be accelerated, the efficiency should be improved, and together with the earthwork already completed, a total of 2.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork should be completed for water conservancy projects this spring.

　　The number of people working on water conservancy construction in Anhui Province now remains above six million every day, and the water conservancy construction movement is progressing at a rate of more than 22 million cubic meters of earth and stone completed every day. According to the statistics from the Anhui Provincial Water Conservancy Construction Office, the total amount of earth and stone completed in the province has exceeded 1.9 billion cubic meters. However, there are still more than 450,000 projects under intense construction. In order to "repair one, make it good," to thoroughly complete the unfinished projects, and to ensure the quality of the projects, some finishing work will be done on some of the completed projects. It is estimated that after completing two eight-hundred million cubic meters, another eight-hundred million cubic meters will be needed. Therefore, after over-fulfilling the sixteen-hundred million cubic meters of water conservancy projects in winter, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the combat slogan of completing the task of 2.4 billion cubic meters of water conservancy construction.

　　When planning new construction tasks, various places in the province are conducting inspections and acceptance of completed projects to ensure the quality of the projects. The masses of Yangqianwei in Feidong County proudly said: "If you want to break my Yangqianwei, unless ninety-nine dragons come out of the Dabie Mountains." The Feidong County Party Committee also proposed the method of "continuous inspection, regular inspection, and circuit inspection." If any substandard quality engineering is found, it will be repaired immediately.

　　完成两个八亿　再来一个八亿
    安徽提出完成兴修水利二十四亿土方的战斗任务
    本报讯　安徽日报消息：1月28日安徽省委举行的扩大会议，针对当前兴修水利的发展情况，对今春兴修农田水利提出了一个新的奋斗目标。这就是，进度还要加快，效率还要提高，连同已经完成的土方，今春要累计完成二十四亿土方的兴修水利任务。
    安徽省现在每天上工兴修水利的人数，保持在六百万人以上，兴修水利运动正以每天完成二千二百多万土石方的进度向前进展着。据安徽省兴修水利办公室的统计，目前全省累计完成的土石方已超过十九亿公方，但是，现在还有四十五万多处工程正在紧张施工。为了“修一处，好一处”，把未完的工程彻底做好，同时为了保证工程质量，对某些已完工的工程再进行一些加工工作，估计在完成两个八亿公方以后，还需要再做八亿公方。因此，在冬季超额完成了十六亿公方的水利工程之后，省委又提出了完成二十四亿公方水利兴修任务的战斗口号。
    省内各地在规划新的兴修任务时，都结合对已经完工的工程进行检查验收，以保证工程质量。肥东县扬千圩群众自豪地说：“想要破我扬千圩，除非大别山出九十九条蛟。”肥东县委还提出“不断检查、定期检查、巡回检查”的办法，发现不合标准质量的工程，随即进行补修。
