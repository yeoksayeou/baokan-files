Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 30th - Supply and marketing cooperatives in Jilin Province are organizing the supply of spring plowing production materials ahead of schedule.

The Jilin Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative began organizing sources of spring plowing production materials in the third quarter of last year. The province plans to supply more agricultural cultivation, irrigation and drainage machinery, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, draft animals, and other production materials this year than in previous years, with irrigation and drainage machinery increasing by 106 times compared to last year. Most of these production materials have already been subject to production and sales contracts between the supply and marketing cooperatives and the Changchun First Automotive Manufacturing Plant, as well as twenty-nine units in Shanghai, Tianjin, and elsewhere. Part of them are steadily being transported to the countryside.

Before organizing sources of goods, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the province mostly conducted in-depth research in agricultural cooperatives to understand the changes and needs. According to the characteristics of farmers' demands for "more varieties, larger quantities, and higher quality" this year, they actively cooperated with industrial departments to properly arrange production. Supply and marketing cooperatives in cities and counties such as Jilin, Nong'an, Panshi, and Dehui have already organized relevant units to produce more than 1,000 paddy field plows, more than 260 carts, as well as many small agricultural tools and improved agricultural tools such as rope sets, hoe blades, and paddy field seeders. Supply and marketing cooperatives in cities and counties such as Yitong, Shulan, Jilin, and Jiutai have currently purchased more than 680 head of draft animals and breeding livestock. Baicheng, Kaitong, and Taonan counties produce horses, and the supply and marketing cooperatives in these counties are purchasing large numbers of horses to supply other counties. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to reserve more than 4,000 head of various fat and strong draft animals for agricultural cooperatives this year to meet the needs of spring plowing production.

　　吉林提前供应生产资料
    新华社长春30日电　吉林省各地供销合作社提早组织春耕生产资料的供应工作。
    吉林省供销合作社从去年第三季度就开始组织春耕生产资料的货源。全省今年计划供应的各种农田耕作、排灌机械和农药、化学肥料、耕畜等生产资料，都比往年大大增加，其中排灌机械就比去年增加一百零六倍。这些生产资料的大部分，已经由供销社同长春第一汽车制造厂以及上海、天津等二十九个单位签订了产销合同，一部分正源源运往农村。
    全省各地供销社在组织货源以前，大都深入农业社作了调查研究，摸清变化和需要情况。他们根据今年农民要求“品种多、数量大、质量高”的特点，积极主动地与工业部门配合，妥善地安排生产。吉林、农安、磐石、德惠等市、县的供销社，已经组织有关单位生产水田洋犁一千多台，大车二百六十多辆，以及绳套、锄板、水田播种机等许多小农具和改良农具。伊通、舒兰、吉林、九台等市、县供销社，目前已采购耕畜和种畜六百八十多头。白城、开通、洮南等县产马，这些县的供销社正在大量采购马匹供应其他各县。省供销社今年决定为农业社储备各种肥壮耕畜四千多头，以满足春耕生产的需要。
