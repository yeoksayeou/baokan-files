    In regard to the question of returning home to participate in housework, I would like to offer a slightly different perspective. I joined the army in 1943 and worked in medical teams for a long time. No matter how difficult the environment, I worked and studied just like my male comrades, never falling behind. After 1953, I had three children in succession, which greatly affected my work. After work, I simply had no time to study, could not even eat a meal in peace, and the children were not well taken care of. My health also deteriorated day by day. I suffered from anemia, couldn't sleep well at night, and couldn't concentrate on work during the day, making many mistakes. Under these circumstances, I was already very distressed. Unexpectedly, not long ago, my husband criticized me for being behind in work and study, saying that I lacked drive. In a fit of anger, I thought I might as well get a divorce. I wouldn't want any of the three children. By getting rid of the burden of family and children, I would definitely be able to work well and never fall behind others. Of course, the divorce didn't happen, but it put a heavy burden on my husband, affecting his work. Recently, I have been actively requesting to go down to the countryside to settle in rural areas, also to get rid of this family that drags me down. I had originally thought about resigning and returning home to participate in housework, but then I thought, resigning in the middle of the revolution and relying on my husband for a living would lead to unpleasant gossip later on. It would be better to work until I was fifty and then retire. Moreover, it would be difficult to return to work after retiring. At home, I can't learn technology, nor can I improve my cultural, political, and theoretical level. I would fall behind in everything. What work could I do for the country then? The children belong to the country, and to both of us. Why should I be the one to resign? Thinking it over, it's better to rely on myself. Therefore, I can't understand the idea of letting female comrades resign and go home. Without work, how can one live? Housework is just troublesome. I believe that national interests should be put first, and personal family difficulties are nothing.

### 我要跳出家庭事务的圈子

    我要跳出家庭事务的圈子
    对于回家参加家务劳动的问题，我谈一点不同的看法。我是1943年参加部队工作的，长时间在医疗队中工作，无论在任何艰苦的环境中，我都和男同志一样工作、学习，从没有落在人后。1953年以后，我连续生了三个孩子，这使我的工作受到很大影响。下班以后我简直没有时间学习，甚至都不能安静地吃一顿饭，孩子照顾得很不好。我的身体也一天一天坏起来了，得了贫血症，晚上睡不好，白天不能集中精力工作，发生了不少差错。在这种情况下，我自己已经非常苦恼，想不到，不久以前我爱人又批评我工作、学习落后了，说我干劲不大。我一气之下，我就想干脆离婚算了，三个小孩我一个也不要。丢掉家庭、孩子的牵挂，我一定能好好地工作，绝不会落在别人后面。离婚当然没有离成，但却使我爱人也背上了一个沉重的包袱，影响了工作。最近，我积极要求下乡上山到农村中去落户，也是想摆脱这个拖人后腿的家庭。本来我曾想退职回家参加家务劳动，但又一想，革命中途退职依靠爱人生活，以后闲话难听，还不如工作到五十岁再退职。而且退职以后再复职就困难了，在家里，既不能学习技术，又不能提高文化、政治和理论水平，什么都落后了，还能为国家做什么工作呢？小孩子是国家的，是两个人的，为什么偏偏我要退职呢？想来想去，还是自力更生的好。因此，我对于让女同志退职回家是想不通的。没有工作，怎么生活下去？家务事就是麻烦的，我认为，应当把国家利益放在第一位，个人家庭中的困难算不了什么。
