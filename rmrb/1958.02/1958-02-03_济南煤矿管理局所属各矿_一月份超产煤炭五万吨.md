Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 1st: The staff and workers of the mines under the Jinan Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry exceeded the original state plan for January by 50,000 tons of coal, creating the highest monthly raw coal output record in the history of East China.

　　In January, the workers of the twenty-eight coal mines under this bureau universally launched a competition to increase coal production through rectification, and therefore new production records continued to emerge. After implementing one-shift coal mining on 119 working faces in the Shuangshan Coal Mine, output increased linearly, and efficiency increased from the planned 3.28 tons to an average of 5 tons. Miners in the Xiaqiao, Hanqiao and other coal mines in the Jiawang mining area created more than 60 new records in one month.

　　Due to the increase in labor productivity and the commissioning of a large number of new wells, the average daily output of raw coal in the East China coal mining system has rapidly increased. The average daily output in January this year increased by one-third compared with the daily output in January last year; more than doubled the average daily output in January 1953.

　　济南煤矿管理局所属各矿
    一月份超产煤炭五万吨
    本报特约新华社济南1日电　煤炭工业部济南管理局所属各煤矿职工在1月份比原订国家计划超产煤炭五万吨，创造了华东地区历史上原煤月产量最高纪录。
    1月份，这个局所属二十八个煤矿的职工，通过整改普遍掀起了增产煤炭的竞赛，因此生产新纪录不断涌现。双山煤矿一百一十九掌子面推行一班采煤以后，产量直线上升，效率由计划的三点二八吨，平均提高到五吨。贾汪矿区夏桥、韩桥等煤矿的矿工，在一个月内就创造了六十多项新纪录。
    华东煤矿系统由于劳动生产率的提高和大批新井投入生产，原煤日产量迅速上升。今年1月的平均日产量，比去年1月的日产量提高了三分之一；比1953年1月的平均日产量提高一倍以上。
