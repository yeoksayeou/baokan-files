I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. I would now like to offer some opinions on the issue of organizing a Great Leap Forward in hog production in Henan Province this year.

"If you plant crops without manure, it's like groping around blindly." "A farmer who doesn't raise pigs is like a scholar who doesn't read." Strive to exceed 30 billion jin of grain this year, and be sure to achieve an average of two pigs per farmer household.

The people of Henan are doing everything possible to organize a bumper harvest and a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, so that this year's grain production will reach and strive to exceed 30 billion jin on the basis of last year's 24.6 billion jin, an increase of 21.9% over last year. Among them, wheat will reach and strive to exceed 10 billion jin on the basis of last year's 7.44 billion jin, an increase of 34.4% over last year. Cotton, oil crops, flue-cured tobacco, and other agricultural production must also strive for a bumper harvest. The key to ensuring the realization of this plan is: large-scale water conservancy, large-scale improvement of paddy fields, and large-scale opening of fertilizer sources. As the saying goes, "A farmer who doesn't raise pigs is like a scholar who doesn't read." "If you plant crops without manure, it's like groping around blindly." It can be seen how important raising pigs and accumulating manure are. In order to strive for an average of 10,000 jin of farm manure per mu this year, we are determined to increase the number of live pigs from 7.46 million in 1957 to 20 million, with an average of two pigs per farmer household in the province's rural areas, and an average of one pig per 6.8 mu of land.

The plan to raise 20 million pigs this year can definitely be completed as long as we go all out, mobilize the masses, and use all favorable conditions.

Can this plan be realized? Experience tells us that as long as we go all out, mobilize the masses, and use all favorable conditions, it is entirely possible. In 1956, Henan had only 3.59 million live pigs. Thanks to the resolute implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on developing hog production, the thorough mobilization of the masses, and the vigorous resolution of problems such as feed and swine fever, by the end of 1957, it had jumped to 7.46 million, far exceeding the highest level in Henan's history, more than double that of 1956. For example, in Xingyang County, which historically lacked the habit of raising pigs, thanks to the strengthening of leadership by the Xingyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the cultivation of key pig-raising areas, and the promotion of advanced experience, the number of live pigs increased from 9,149 in 1956 to 76,690 by the end of 1957, an increase of 8.3 times. In Huaibin, Nanyang, Dancheng, Huojia and other counties, the number of live pigs last year also increased by more than three times compared with 1956. According to incomplete statistics from 77 counties in the province, there are already 140 townships and 1,240 agricultural cooperatives where each household raises more than two pigs; there are 293 townships and 273 agricultural cooperatives where each household raises more than three pigs on average; and there are 87 townships and 366 agricultural cooperatives where each household raises more than four pigs on average. Zhuchuan Agricultural Cooperative in Xingyang County has never had the habit of raising pigs, and the mortality rate of pigs once reached 90%, suffering three serious setbacks. However, under the leadership of the Party Committee, they were not discouraged and put forward the slogan of not being afraid of difficulties: "Find the lost sheep in the sheepfold, and find the lost pigs in the pigsty." Finally, they developed pig raising, reaching an average of more than three pigs per household. Now they have put forward a bigger plan: "Raising 10,000 pigs, accumulating 1 million dan of manure, applying 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and increasing grain and cotton production by half." These examples show that the plan to raise 20 million pigs this year can be completely accomplished with unremitting efforts.

To develop to 20 million pigs, are there enough pigs? Yes. Our province originally had 1.4 million sows and 93,000 boars. The plan is to develop another 570,000 sows and 10,000 boars this year. In this way, about 20 million piglets can be bred throughout the year, plus the original base in 1957, the problem of pig sources can be completely solved.

There are ways to solve the problem of feed for live pigs: the substitute feed successfully tested in Xinxiang and Kaifeng can replace half a jin of grain per jin; rice bran can also be greatly increased; preparations are being made to greatly promote the planting of water hyacinth; and private plots can also produce a lot of pig feed.

Solving the feed problem for live pigs is the key to whether the pig-raising industry can develop. There are two attitudes towards solving pig feed: some people simply reach out to the state for grain, believing that pig production cannot be developed without increasing grain; the other is to find substitutes and coarse feed in every possible way. Facts have proved that those who hold the first attitude are stagnating in the pig-raising industry; on the contrary, those who hold the latter attitude have seen a leap forward in pig raising. Qiliying Agricultural Cooperative in Xinxiang County uses cotton peach shells, peanut skins, corn cobs, and other items, after drying or stir-frying, crushing, fermenting, and other processing processes, to make a large amount of pig feed, which pigs like very much. However, some people objected at the beginning, saying, "I've never heard of corn stalks being able to feed pigs. You are really capable of going to heaven." After it was made, some people still doubted it, fearing that pigs would not grow meat and would have diarrhea. After a period of use, the members saw with their own eyes that the pigs were safe and sound and grew normally after eating, and the conservative ideas disappeared. The tone of saying "Raising pigs, can't afford to feed them, feeding grain is not cost-effective" can no longer be heard, and the pig-raising industry has rapidly developed. In just 20 days, the number of live pigs in the whole cooperative increased from 280 to 692, an increase of 2.5 times. Xinshui Agricultural Cooperative in Kaifeng County uses even wider things. They fry and crush corn cobs, cotton peach shells, peanut skins, sweet potato vines, soybean roots, rice bran, sorghum husks, picking tree seeds, etc., and make "spice noodles," which greatly solves the problem of feed for livestock and pigs. The Kaifeng Special Zone has vigorously promoted it for three years, and many counties have achieved building factories (processing plants) in every cooperative, processing in every team, and dedicated personnel in charge, manufacturing in large quantities. The special zone expects to produce more than 440 million jin this year. This kind of substitute product, after being tested by the agricultural scientific research institutions in our province, contains protein, fat, starch, fiber, and other ingredients, and each jin can replace about half a jin of grain. At present, our province has organized the widespread promotion of the above two experiences throughout the province and has received good results. If the work is done early, the province can collect more than 3 billion jin this year, which is a great source for solving feed for live pigs and livestock. With this substitute alone, 5 million pigs can be raised in winter and spring. At the same time, this year the province's paddy fields will develop to 17 million mu, which can produce more than 1.6 billion jin of rice bran, and more than 2.7 million pigs can be raised in winter and spring. It should also be specially pointed out that after the large-scale water conservancy construction this year, the province has about 5 million mu of ponds, small reservoirs, and pools. If one-tenth of them are used to plant water hyacinth (experimental promotion was carried out in 1957), each mu can produce 150,000 jin, which can produce about 75 billion jin and can raise 18 million pigs. We have already bought seeds and plan to send them to the masses for planting without compensation. In addition to the above items, the province also has more than 4 million mu of private plots, and various pig feeds can produce at least more than 2 billion jin. At the same time, there are other various substitute feeds that can be used. In this way, not only can the feed for 20 million pigs in 1958 be completely solved, but also a road has been opened up for the greater development of live pigs in the future.

There are now proper ways to prevent and control swine fever. The rabbit vaccine painstakingly made by two middle school students in Lankao County is simple, effective, and easy to promote. The province will form and train a team of 100,000 people to go to the countryside and cooperatives to inject vaccines into 20 million pigs.

Preventing and controlling swine fever is another major problem that must be solved in the Great Leap Forward in pig raising. In 1957, swine fever occurred in 102 counties in our province. According to incomplete statistics, 475,000 live pigs died. There are now simple and effective prevention and control methods for swine fever, which is the rabbit vaccine used by Hou Zhimin and Wang Fulou, two middle school students in Lankao County. After painstaking research, they only need to invest more than 1,100 yuan to purchase a microscope and some simple equipment, plus a room, to make rabbit vaccine. They use large-mouthed insulated bottles for ice cream to replace low-temperature equipment, store the vaccine, and carry it to the countryside to inject pigs on a tour. One rabbit-made vaccine can inject 200 live pigs, and the cost of injecting a pig with vaccine is only about two cents, and the immunity can reach one and a half years. The injection method is also simple and safe. Even if the injected live pigs are with sick pigs, they are safe and sound. Wherever this method is implemented, the spread of swine fever has been effectively stopped, greatly promoting the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs. The number of live pigs in Lankao County has increased from more than 14,000 in 1956 to 40,000. These two middle school students are welcomed by the masses everywhere, and the masses enthusiastically call them "pig doctors." Our province has fully and vigorously promoted this experience, and simple rabbit vaccine manufacturing plants have been universally established in various special districts and counties, and have received good results. At the same time, this year, a team of 100,000 people to prevent and control swine fever will be organized and trained throughout the province. The method is for technicians to go to the countryside and cooperatives to train by region, universally establish an epidemic network, and inject vaccines into 20 million pigs.

In addition, specific arrangements have been made for the purchase of live pigs and the establishment of cold storage. It is planned to build two or three more cold storage facilities this year to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in pig production. At the same time, it is also necessary to universally and thoroughly mobilize the masses to encircle pigs and accumulate fertilizer.

Twenty million pigs are equal to 20 million "small fertilizer factories," which can accumulate more than 200 billion jin of fertilizer. With irrigation and other conditions, 3 to 4 billion jin of grain can be produced annually. After the 1958 pig-raising plan is realized, it will bring great benefits to the people of the province. Twenty million pigs are equal to 20 million "small fertilizer factories," which can accumulate more than 200 billion jin of fertilizer. With irrigation and other conditions, 3 to 4 billion jin of grain can be produced; if half of them are sold, the monetary income of farmers can be increased by 500 million yuan; if one-tenth of them are exported, 350,000 tons of steel can be exchanged. In short, a large-scale development of live pigs can not only increase grain production, but also strongly support the country's industrialization and greatly supply the meat needs of urban and rural people, which is of great benefit to the country, agricultural cooperatives, and members.

    河南今年要养猪两千万头
    刘名榜代表谈河南省农业生产大跃进和发展生猪问题
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长及吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。现在我仅就河南省今年组织生猪生产大跃进的问题，发表一点意见。
    “种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混”“庄稼汉，不养猪，等于秀才不读书”，争取今年粮食超过三百亿斤，一定要做到平均每户农民养猪两头。
    河南人民正在想尽一切办法，从各方面组织农业生产的大丰收、大跃进，使今年粮食生产在去年二百四十六亿斤的基础上，达到并争取超过三百亿斤，比去年增长百分之二十一点九。其中小麦在去年七十四亿四千万斤的基础上，达到并争取超过一百亿斤，比去年增长百分之三十四点四，棉花、油料、烤烟及其他农业生产都要争取大丰收。保证实现这一计划的关键是：大兴水利，大改稻田，大开肥源。俗话说：“庄稼汉，不养猪，等于秀才不读书。”“种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混。”可见养猪积肥是多么重要。为了争取今年每亩平均施农肥一万斤，我们决心要把生猪在一九五七年七百四十六万头的基础上，发展到二千万头，全省农村每户平均养猪两头，平均每六亩八分地养猪一头。
    今年养猪两千万头的计划，只要鼓足干劲，发动群众，运用各种有利条件，一定能够完成。
    这个计划能不能实现呢？经验告诉我们，只要鼓足干劲，发动群众，运用各种有利条件，是完全能够办到的。一九五六年，河南只有生猪三百五十九万头，由于坚决贯彻执行了中共中央和国务院关于发展生猪生产的指示，深入发动了群众，大力地解决了饲料和猪疫等问题，到一九五七年底就一跃发展到七百四十六万头，大大超过了河南历史上的最高水平，比一九五六年增加了一倍多。如历史上缺乏养猪习惯的荥阳县，由于中共荥阳县委加强了领导，培养了养猪重点，推广了先进经验，生猪由一九五六年的九千一百四十九头，一九五七年底发展到七万六千六百九十头，增长到八点三倍。淮滨、南阳、郸城、获嘉等县，去年生猪比一九五六年也增长了三倍多。全省据七十七个县的不完全统计，已有一百四十个乡和一千二百四十个农业社每户养猪超过了两头；有二百九十三个乡二百七十三个农业社，平均每户养猪超过了三头；有八十七个乡三百六十六个农业社，平均每户养猪在四头以上。荥阳县竹川农业社，历来没有养猪习惯，猪的死亡率曾经达到百分之九十，遭受过三次严重挫折。但是，他们在党委的领导下不灰心，提出了：“羊丢了羊圈里找，猪丢了猪圈里捞”的不怕困难的口号，终于把养猪发展起来，达到每户平均三头多。现在他们又提出：“养猪上万头，积肥百万担，亩施万斤肥，粮棉增产半倍半”的更大的计划。这些事例说明了，今年养猪两千万头的计划，经过不懈的努力，是完全可以办到的。
    要发展到两千万头猪，有没有猪源呢？有。我省原有母猪一百四十万头，公猪九万三千头。计划今年再发展母猪五十七万头，公猪一万头。这样，全年约可繁殖小猪两千万头，再加上一九五七年原有基数，猪源问题完全可以解决。
    生猪饲料问题有办法解决：新乡和开封试用成功的代用饲料，每斤能顶半斤粮食；稻糠也能大大增加；准备大大推广种植水浮莲；自留地也能生产不少猪饲料。
    解决生猪的饲料，是养猪事业能否发展的关键。对于解决猪饲料，有两种态度：有些人单纯的伸手向国家要粮食，认为不增加粮食就不能发展生猪；另一种是千方百计的找代用品和粗饲料。事实证明，凡是抱着第一种态度的，养猪事业都裹足不前；反之，抱后一种态度的，养猪都有了飞跃的发展。新乡县七里营农业社利用棉桃壳、花生皮和玉米芯等物品，经过炕干或炒干、碾碎、发酵等加工过程，制成大量的猪饲料，猪很喜欢吃。但是，开始有人反对说：“没听说草棒棒能喂猪，你们真是能的要上天。”制成以后，也还有人怀疑，怕猪吃了不长肉，会拉稀。经过使用一个时期后，社员们亲眼看到了猪吃了平安无事，生长正常，从而保守思想才烟消云散了。那种说什么“养起猪，喂不起猪，喂粮食不合算”的声调再也听不到了，养猪事业就迅速发展起来，仅仅二十天的时间，全社生猪就由二百八十头发展到六百九十二头，增加了两倍半。开封县新生活农业社，利用的东西就更加广泛。他们把玉米芯、棉桃壳、花生皮、红薯秧、大豆根、谷糠、高粱壳、拣树子等，经过炕焦、碾碎，制成“香料面”，大量地解决了牲畜和猪的饲料问题。开封专区三年来已经大力推广，许多县已经做到了社社建厂（加工场），队队加工，专人负责，大量制造。该专区预计今年可以搞四亿四千多万斤。这种代用品，经我省农业科学研究机关化验，含有蛋白、脂肪、淀粉、纤维等成份，每斤约可顶半斤粮食。目前，我省对于上述两种经验，已经组织在全省普遍推广，已经收到了良好的效果。如果及早做好工作，今年全省就可收集三十多亿斤，对于解决生猪和牲畜饲料是一个很大的源泉，只此一项代用品，冬春两季即可养猪五百万头。同时，今年全省稻田将要发展到一千七百万亩，约可产稻糠十六亿多斤，冬、春两季可养猪二百七十多万头。还应该特别指出的是，经过今年大兴水利，全省约有塘、小水库、潭坑等五百多万亩，如利用其十分之一种植水浮莲（一九五七年已作了试验性的推广），每亩以产十五万斤计算，约可产七百五十亿斤，能养猪一千八百万头。目前我们已经买了种子，拟无代价送给群众种植。除上述几项之外，全省还有自留地四百多万亩，各种猪饲料至少可产二十多亿斤。同时，还有其他各种各样的代饲料可以利用。这样，不但一九五八年两千万头的猪饲料完全能够解决，而且还为今后生猪的更大发展开辟了道路。
    防治猪瘟，现在也有妥善办法，兰考县两个中学生苦心制成的兔化疫苗，既简便又有效，极易推广；全省将组成并训练一支十万人的队伍，下乡下社，要给两千万头猪都注射一次疫苗。
    防治猪瘟，是养猪大跃进的另一个必须解决的大问题。一九五七年我省就有一百零二个县发生猪疫。据不完全统计，死生猪达四十七万五千头。对于猪疫，现在已经有了简便而又有效的防治办法，这就是兰考县两个中学生侯智民、王福禄所采用的兔化疫苗。他们经过苦心研究，只用投资一千一百多元，购买一架显微镜和一些简陋的设备，再有一间房子，就可以制成兔化疫苗。他们用盛冰棍的大口保暖瓶，代替低温设备，装盛疫苗，背着下乡，巡回给猪注射。一支兔子制造的疫苗，就能够注射二百头生猪，注射一口猪的疫苗成本不过二分钱左右，而免疫力可达一年半。注射方法也简单、安全，注射后的生猪，即使同病猪一起，也安然无恙。凡是实行了这个方法的地方，都有效地制止了猪瘟的蔓延，大大地促进了群众养猪的积极性。兰考县的生猪已由一九五六年的一万四千多头发展到四万头。这两个中学生到处都受到群众欢迎，群众热情地称他们为“猪大夫”。我省已经全面地大力地推广了这个经验，简单的兔化疫苗制造厂已经在各专、县普遍地建立起来，而且收到了良好的效果。同时，今年还要在全省组织和训练一支十万人的防治猪瘟的队伍，办法是技术人员下乡下社，分片训练，普遍建立疫情网，给两千万头猪都注射一次疫苗。
    此外，对于生猪的收购问题以及建立冷藏库，也作了具体布置，拟在今年再建两、三个冷藏库，以适应猪的生产大跃进的需要。同时，还要普遍深入的发动群众，圈猪积肥。
    两千万头猪就等于两千万个“小化肥工厂”，约可积肥两千多亿斤，加上灌溉和其他条件，每年可增产三、四十亿斤粮食。一九五八年养猪计划实现以后，将给全省人民带来很大的好处。两千万头猪，就等于两千万个“小化肥工厂”，约可积肥两千多亿斤，再加上灌溉和其他条件，可增产三、四十亿斤粮食；如果出卖其一半，即可增加农民五亿元的货币收入；如果以其十分之一出口，就可换回三十五万吨钢材。总之，大量地发展生猪，不但能增加粮食生产，而且还能有力地支援国家工业化，大量地供应城、乡人民的肉食需要，对国家对农业社和社员都有很大好处。
