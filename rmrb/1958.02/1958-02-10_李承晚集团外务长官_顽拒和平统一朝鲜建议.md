Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from Seoul: Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Cao Zheng Huan, brazenly stated on the 8th that he rejects the proposal for peaceful reunification of Korea made by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Cao Zheng Huan, at a press conference, expressed his refusal to hold free elections throughout Korea. He reiterated the absurd claim of the Syngman Rhee clique to hold elections in North Korea under the supervision of United Nations organs. He also unilaterally stated that the Chinese People's Volunteers must withdraw from North Korea unconditionally, but avoided discussing the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops, including US troops, from both North and South Korea.

　　李承晚集团外务长官
    顽拒和平统一朝鲜建议
    新华社9日讯　汉城消息：李承晚的外务省长官曹正焕8日公然表示拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于和平统一朝鲜的建议。
    曹正焕在记者招待会上表示拒绝在全朝鲜举行自由选举。他重申李承晚集团的在联合国机构的监督下在朝鲜北部举行选举的荒谬主张。他并且片面地说什么中国人民志愿军必须无条件撤出朝鲜北部，但是避而不谈包括美军在内的一切外国军队同时撤出南北朝鲜的问题。
