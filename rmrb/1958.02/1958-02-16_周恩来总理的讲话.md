Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th. The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the state banquet held by Korean Cabinet Premier Kim Il-sung in welcome of the Chinese government delegation on February 15th is as follows: Respected Premier Comrade, respected Comrades, friends:

　　The Chinese government delegation feels very honored to be able to attend such a grand banquet today. Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to Premier Comrade and all the comrades and friends present.

　　Since we arrived in your country, we have been surrounded by an atmosphere of warmth and friendship. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed by the Korean people. These heartfelt and kind feelings deeply moved us, made us deeply appreciate the Korean people's friendship and love for the Chinese people, and also made us feel the warmth of the socialist family. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has a long history. As far back as thousands of years ago, our two peoples had close contacts. In modern times, in the long struggle against colonialism and imperialism, our two peoples have always been close comrades-in-arms who sympathized with and supported each other. Since our two peoples successively gained liberation and became masters of their own countries, the friendly relations between us have developed to a new stage. In the war in which the two peoples jointly resisted American imperialist aggression, our friendship was further consolidated and strengthened. Our friendship can be called a friendship cemented with blood.

　　Since the Korean armistice, our two countries have engaged in close cooperation in the unremitting struggle to maintain the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In order to carry out socialist construction, our two countries have supported and learned from each other in all aspects. Premier Kim Il-sung's two visits to China in 1953 and 1954, and Vice Chairman Zhu De's visit to Korea in 1955, played a significant role in strengthening Sino-Korean relations. I hope that this visit by the Chinese government delegation will also help to further develop the friendly relations between our two countries.

　　The great friendship between China and Korea exists not only because our two countries are neighboring countries dependent on each other like lips and teeth, but more importantly, because we both have the lofty ideal of communism and are members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. This great internationalist friendship is precisely the common characteristic of the mutual relations between all socialist countries. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea defeated the American aggression and guarded the eastern front against imperialism. This is an extremely important contribution to the common cause of the socialist camp. The Soviet Union and other fraternal countries are very concerned about the Korean people's cause of resisting aggression and building their motherland, and are doing their best to provide internationalist support. China and Korea, through close cooperation and mutual visits with various fraternal countries, are constantly strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This unity, after the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in Moscow last November and the publication of two important declarations, has developed to a new stage, further guaranteeing the cause of world peace and human progress.

　　Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have made significant achievements in restoring the economy and building socialism, and are making new efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. I believe that with the support of the strong socialist camp, and with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the hardworking and brave Korean people will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve new and greater victories in their cause.

　　Please allow me to propose a toast: To the health of Comrade Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the health of Comrade Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,

　　To the glorious Korean Workers' Party,

　　To the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples,

　　To the close unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union,

　　To world peace,

　　Cheers!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社平壤15日电　周恩来总理15日在朝鲜内阁首相金日成为欢迎中国政府代表团举行的国宴会上发表的讲话全文如下：敬爱的首相同志，敬爱的同志们，朋友们：
    中国政府代表团今天能够参加这样盛大的宴会，感到十分荣幸。请允许我向首相同志和在座的同志们和朋友们表示衷心的感谢。
    自从我们来到你们的国家，就一直被热情和友好的气氛所包围。无论在那里，我们都受到了朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎。这种发自内心的亲切感情，深深地感动了我们，使我们深刻地体会到朝鲜人民对中国人民的友谊和热爱，也使我们感到社会主义大家庭的温暖。中朝人民的友谊，是有着悠久的历史的。远在几千年以前，我们两国人民就有了亲密的来往。到了近代，在反殖民主义、反帝国主义的长期斗争中，我们两国人民一直是相互同情、相互支持的亲密战友。自从我们两国人民相继获得解放，成了自己国家的主人以后，我们之间的友好关系就发展到了一个新的阶段。在两国人民共同反抗美国帝国主义侵略的战争中，我们的友谊得到了进一步的巩固和加强。我们的友谊称得起是鲜血凝成的友谊。
    朝鲜停战以后，我们两国在努力维护朝鲜停战和争取和平解决朝鲜问题的不懈斗争中，进行了密切的合作。为了进行社会主义建设，我们两国在各方面互相支援，互相学习。1953年和1954年金日成首相两次访问中国，1955年朱德副主席访问朝鲜，对加强中朝两国关系起了重大的作用。我希望，中国政府代表团这次访问也能够有助于我们两国友好关系的进一步发展。
    中国和朝鲜之间存在着伟大的友谊，不仅因为我们两国是唇齿相依的邻国，而且更重要的，是因为我们都有着共产主义的崇高理想，都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员。这种伟大的国际主义友谊，正是所有社会主义国家之间相互关系的共同特点。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国击败了美国的侵略，守卫着反帝国主义的东方前线。这对于社会主义阵营的共同事业是极其重大的贡献。苏联和其它兄弟国家对朝鲜人民反抗侵略和建设祖国的事业，都非常关怀，并且尽力给予国际主义的支持。中朝两国通过同各兄弟国家的密切合作和相互访问，不断地加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。这种团结，经过去年11月各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行会议和发表两个重要的宣言，发展到了一个新的阶段，使世界和平和人类进步的事业有了进一步的保证。
    在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相的领导下，朝鲜人民在恢复经济和建设社会主义方面已经取得了重大的成就，并且为争取祖国的和平统一进行着新的努力。我相信，有了强大的社会主义阵营的支持，有了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民一定能够克服一切困难，在自己的事业中取得新的和更大的胜利。
    请允许我建议：为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成同志的健康，为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健同志的健康，
    为光荣的朝鲜劳动党，
    为中朝两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的亲密团结，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
