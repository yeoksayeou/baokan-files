    The Magic Trick is Hard to Pull Off

    After the French aircraft wildly bombed the Tunisian border, Washington expressed particular concern. Dulles received the Tunisian and French ambassadors to the United States on the 10th on the same day. Dulles wanted to use double-dealing tactics to cover up the consistent double-dealing face of the United States between France and Tunisia. The American ruling authorities are trying to shirk the blame they must share in France's aggressive actions.

    However, Dulles's efforts are in vain, because this effort itself inevitably exposes the position of the American rulers in supporting the French colonialists.

    When Dulles met the Tunisian ambassador, he put on a comforting posture, talking a lot about how "France and Tunisia are both friends of the United States." The United States has no sympathy or support for Tunisia, which has been harmed, and instead advises it to "make big things small." It is very obvious that the United States is completely on the side of the French colonialists.

    On the other hand, when Dulles met the French ambassador, he talked heartily about private matters, guaranteeing that the US government would not issue "any sharp criticism" of France, which in essence was encouraging the French colonialists.

    Although Dulles is called a "clever magician" by the American bourgeois newspapers, this time the "sleight of hand" is not working.

    戏法难变
    在法国飞机狂炸突尼斯边境的事情发生以后，华盛顿方面表示特别关切。杜勒斯在10日同一天中分别接见了突尼斯和法国驻美国的大使。杜勒斯是想用两面派的手腕来掩盖美国在法国和突尼斯之间一贯的两面派的面目。美国统治当局力图推卸它在法国侵略行动中必须分担的罪责。
    但是杜勒斯的努力是徒然的，因为他的这一项努力本身也不可避免地暴露了美国统治者支持法国殖民者的立场。
    杜勒斯接见突尼斯大使的时候，摆出一个安抚者的姿态，大谈什么“法国和突尼斯都是美国的朋友”。美国对于受了损害的突尼斯毫无同情和支持的表示，反而劝它“大事化小”，美国完全站在法国殖民者一边是十分明显的。
    另一方面，杜勒斯接见法国大使的时候，则开怀畅谈私房话，保证美国政府不会对法国发表“任何尖锐的批评”，实质上是给法国殖民者打气。
    杜勒斯虽然被美国资产阶级报纸称为“高明的魔术家”，但是这一回的“障眼法”是不灵了。
