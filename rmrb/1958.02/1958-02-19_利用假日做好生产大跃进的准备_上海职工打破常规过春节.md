Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 18th: Over one million workers in Shanghai broke convention, celebrating the first Spring Festival of the Second Five-Year Plan with practical actions such as "not going home for the Spring Festival, no absenteeism before or after the festival, and celebrating the Spring Festival thriftily."

Large numbers of workers and cadres in Shanghai who had already bought train and boat tickets to return home for the festival went to the ticket offices at the train and boat stations to return their tickets. A special ticket refund office at Shanghai North Station had refunded a total of more than 16,600 tickets by the 16th.

Many factories currently discussing this year's plans for increasing production and practicing economy, the workers are determined to use the Spring Festival holiday to prepare for a great leap forward in production after the festival. The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, whose production target for this year is nearly double that of last year, needs to move and install machine tools and carry out technical reforms in some workshops this year, and some equipment that cannot normally be shut down for maintenance must also be overhauled during the Spring Festival. All the workers in the factory's electromechanical workshop did not return home, but stayed in the factory to do maintenance and relocation of machine tools. After many young workers at the jointly owned Huayuan Dyestuff Factory returned their tickets, they organized a "Spring Festival Maintenance Youth Shock Brigade" to carry out a major overhaul of the factory's machinery and equipment.

New Year's Eve is a rest day for the Ya'pu'er Light Bulb Factory. The two hundred workers in the glass workshop saw that the glass bulbs for the light bulbs were often in short supply in the past. They produced as usual, took one day off today, and will go to work tomorrow, striving to increase production by 150,000 glass bulbs within three days.

Many old conventions that have existed for many years have been swept away this year. More than twenty employees of the Linde Hing Medical Equipment Factory cancelled the three tables of food and wine they had booked and held a tea party on the evening of the 14th. Everyone excitedly talked about the country's prospects and their personal plans for the future, and also performed many programs. Everyone felt satisfied. Some workers said that such a tea party was much more interesting than eating a meal. Some workers canceled the three tables of wine and dishes they had ordered and held a tea party on the evening of the 14th.

    利用假日做好生产大跃进的准备
    上海职工打破常规过春节
    据新华社上海18日电　上海一百多万职工打破常规，以“春节不回家、节前节后不缺勤、勤俭节约过春节”的实际行动，欢度第二个五年计划的第一个春节。
    上海天天有大批已经买好车票、船票准备回乡过节的职工和干部，纷纷到车站和轮船的售票处去退票。上海北站的一个特设的退票处，到16日为止，一共退了一万六千六百多张车票。
    许多正在讨论今年增产节约计划的工厂，职工们决心利用春节假期作好节后生产大跃进的准备工作。今年生产任务比去年增加将近一倍的上海电机厂，有些车间今年需要迁装机床，进行技术改革，有些平时不能停车检修的设备也要在春节检修。这个厂的机电车间全体工人，没有一个人回乡，全部留在厂里做检修和迁装机床的工作。公私合营华元染料厂许多青年工人退了车票以后，组织了一支“春节检修青年突击队”，进行全厂机器设备大检修。
    除夕是亚浦耳灯泡厂的休息日。玻璃车间二百多工人看到过去灯泡的玻璃泡经常供不应求，他们照常生产，今天休息一天后，明天就上班，争取三天内增产十五万只玻璃泡。
    许多常年旧规，今年都被扫除了。林德兴医疗器械厂二十多个职工把已经订好的三桌酒菜退掉，在14日晚上开了一个茶话会，大家兴奋地谈到了国家的远景和个人今后的打算，还表演了许多节目，大家都感到满意。有些工人说，这样的茶话会比吃一顿要有意思得多。
