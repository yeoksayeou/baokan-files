"First Joys" on the Screen
　　Wang Yunman

　　The famous Soviet writer Fedin's "First Joys" and "An Unusual Summer" (the first and second parts of the trilogy) are works familiar and loved by many readers. The film "First Joys" is adapted from the novel of the same name. Like the novel, the film reflects the situation after the 1905 Russian Revolution, touching on a wide range of social aspects, and the characters are drawn from all classes, including proletarian revolutionaries, intellectuals hiding in the "palace of art," and stubborn merchants, as if it were a microcosm of Russian society at that time. However, its central theme is about young people. The young revolutionaries, Izvekov and his girlfriend Liza, leave a deep impression in the film.

　　The love between Izvekov and Liza is somewhat similar to that of Paul and Tonya, but it has its own characteristics. The original novel describes in detail their friendship in childhood, and how this friendship later developed into a pure love. The film's presentation is much more concise, but we can still feel it. In particular, this detail reveals the most intriguing page in their love life. When Liza graduated from high school, Izvekov gave her a notebook with the words: "Freedom, Independence." Only four words, but they clearly show the ideal of their love and the goal of life they yearn for.

　　This theme of love is immediately combined with the revolutionary reality. Therefore, it touches more deeply on the personalities of these two young people who are influenced by different environments and have different ideological understandings. For Izvekov, "Freedom, Independence" means dedication to the revolutionary cause. However, this is not the case for Liza. We see that even as Liza obediently and happily accepts this inscription, she suddenly notices that her father might see them and hurries home in fright. This twist, although seemingly small and ordinary, clearly shows the psychological state of another kind of young person. "Freedom, Independence," it seems, first depends on whether she has the courage to step out of her own home. Therefore, Izvekov can only keep the revolutionary work as a secret hidden in his heart, unable to share with Liza the comradeship that exists outside of love. Once, Liza invited Izvekov to accompany her to the cinema in the evening, but he refused, and Liza reproached him, saying: "I thought I was your only secret, but it turns out you have another secret." This shows her lack of understanding of the new revolutionary life.

　　Izvekov, as a young man who has just embarked on the revolutionary road, is also being tempered by life and taught by the older generation of revolutionaries. For example, the revolutionary leader Peter reminds him not to sharpen potatoes like pencils, otherwise, how can a revolutionary live in exile? The film selects some ordinary scenes, but they have profound implications. Revolutionary truth flows into Izvekov's heart so naturally, and it also makes the audience feel very close. Izvekov also wanted to influence and help Liza, but Liza is a sentimental, fragile girl who can only fantasize but cannot fight. She has no courage to change her life. In the end, they can only part ways and each go their own way!

　　The scenes in the film before and after Liza is forced to marry are extremely artistically infectious. Izvekov's imprisonment and sentencing develop parallel to Liza's marriage. The film uses cross-cutting montage to make a prominent and strong contrast of this series of scenes. In the film, one side shows one blank sheet of paper after another in front of Izvekov, indicating his silent resistance during the interrogation. The next scene is the son of a vulgar merchant coming to Liza's house for a matchmaking meeting. At this time, the film also particularly emphasizes such an artistic detail that the merchant's son is carrying a pocket watch with a chain that has the words: "Be patient." These words are different from the original and were changed by the filmmakers. These words point out the turning point of Liza's fate: from "Freedom, Independence" to "Be patient."

　　In these scenes, Liza's rich inner activities and the ups and downs of her thoughts and feelings are expressed in a thorough, detailed, and accurate manner. As a girl who has had ideals and cherished her first love, she has experienced pain and struggle before completely becoming a slave to a family; she once asked her father, "Do you want to use Shubnikov (the merchant's son) as my savior?" However, she has no courage and does not know how to overcome her father's violence. She succumbed and married. When Liza found herself in this unfortunate situation, she could not help but secretly take out the notebook that Izvekov gave her to look at, and tears filled her eyes. It seemed that, in a short moment, the first joys, love, and ideals of her past life completely reappeared before her eyes... However, even the last bit of right to recall the past was taken away, and her husband took the notebook and tore it to pieces! What was torn was not a souvenir, but Liza's entire life!

　　When we finish watching the film and reopen this famous work, we always feel that the story continues there, and the fate of the characters evokes a series of thoughts... This is the charm of "First Joys."

    银幕上的“初欢”
    王云缦
    苏联著名作家费定的“初欢”、“不平凡的夏天”（三部曲的一、二部），是不少读者熟悉和喜爱的作品。影片“初欢”就是根据同名小说改编的。和小说相同，影片反映了1905年俄国革命后的情景，触及的社会面很广，人物也采自各阶层，有无产阶级革命家，有躲在“艺术之宫”中的知识分子，也有顽固不化的商人，仿佛是当时俄国社会的一幅缩影。但是，它的中心主题却是关于青年人的。青年革命者伊斯维可夫和他的女友里莎，在影片中给人留下深刻的印象。
    伊斯维可夫和里莎的爱情，有点像保尔和冬妮亚的；但却有着自身的特点。原小说比较详细地描写了他们少年时代的友谊，以及这友谊后来如何发展成为纯真的爱情。影片的表现要简略得多，但是，我们依然可以感受得到。特别是这样一个细节，更揭开了他们爱情生活中最令人寻味的一页。当里莎中学毕业时，伊斯维可夫送给她一个本子，本子上写着这样一句话：“自由、独立”。仅仅四个字，却很能表明他们爱情的理想和所向往的生活目标。
    这爱情的主题紧接着就与革命现实结合在一起了。因而也就更深一层地接触到了这两个受着不同环境影响，有着不同思想认识的青年人的性格。“自由、独立”这句话，对于伊斯维可夫来说，就是对于革命事业的献身。可是，对于里莎却不是这样。我们看到，就是在里莎温顺地、幸福地接受这个题辞的同时，她突然发现父亲可能注意到他们，便吓得急急忙忙跑回家去了。这一转折，虽然看来很细小、平常；但是，也就使人们很清晰地看到了另外一种青年人的心理状态，“自由、独立”对于她说，似乎还首先决定于她是否有勇气跨出自己的家门。因此，伊斯维可夫只能将革命工作作为一个深藏在内心的秘密，不能和里莎分享在爱人之外的同志式的感情。里莎有一次邀请伊斯维可夫晚上陪她去看电影，遭到了拒绝，里莎责备他说：“本来我想我是你唯一的秘密了，原来你还有另外的秘密。”这正说明她对新的革命生活的不理解。
    伊斯维可夫，作为一个初踏上革命道路的年青人来说，他也正在受着生活的锻炼的，受着年长一代革命者的教导。例如，革命领导人彼得提醒他，不能像削铅笔似地削马铃薯，要不，一个革命者如何过流放生活？影片选取的是一些平常的情景，却具有着深长的含意。革命真理如此自然地流进了伊斯维可夫的心灵，也使观众觉得十分亲切。而伊斯维可夫也曾想影响、帮助里莎，但是，里莎是个感伤、脆弱、只会幻想而不能斗争的女孩子，她没有勇气改变自己的生活。终于他们只能分道扬镳，各走各的路了！
    影片中里莎被迫出嫁前后的几场戏，极富有艺术感染力量。伊斯维可夫的坐牢、判刑，恰恰和里莎的结婚平行发展着。影片以交叉的蒙太奇手法，将这一系列情景作了突出的、强烈的对照。影片中，一边映出在伊斯维可夫面前的一张又一张白纸，表示他在受审问时的沉默的反抗。紧接着的场面，就是一个俗不可耐的商人的儿子到里莎家来相亲。影片在这时，还特别强调了这样一个艺术细节，商人儿子身上正带了个挂表，表链子上有几个字：“要忍耐”。这句话和原著有所不同，是影片作者改动的。这几个字，正点明了里莎命运的转折点：从“自由、独立”到“要忍耐”。
    在这几场戏里，里莎的丰富的内心活动和思想感情的起伏变化，都得到深入细致和确切的表现。作为一个有过理想，并珍视着自己第一次爱情的少女，她在完完全全成为一个家庭的奴隶前，是有过痛苦和斗争的；她曾经向父亲发问“你想把舒勃尼谷夫（商人之子）作为我的救星吗？”但是，她没有勇气、也不知道怎样去战胜父亲的暴力，她屈服了，嫁了出去。当里莎陷于这种不幸的境遇，禁不住又偷偷拿出伊斯维可夫送给她的本子来看时，泪水充满了她的眼眶。似乎，短短的一刹间，往日的人生最初的欢乐、爱情、理想，又完完全全地浮现在她眼前……。但是，连回想过去的最后的一点权利，也被剥夺了，丈夫夺去了本子，撕碎了！撕碎的不是一本纪念物，而是里莎的整个生活！
    当我们看完电影，又重新打开这部名著的时候，总觉得故事还在那里继续，人物的命运引起我们一连串的思索……这也就是“初欢”的魅力所在。
