　　Pay Attention to Field Management of Winter Crops
　　Since last autumn and winter, the country has sown 500 to 600 million mu of winter crops, including 358 million mu of wheat, 36 million mu of rapeseed, more than 50 million mu of green manure, and more than 60 million mu of broad beans and peas. The wheat planting area accounts for one-fifth of the country's cultivated land; rapeseed accounts for one-third of the entire oil crop area. The success or failure of these two crops directly affects the completion of this year's grain and oil production increase tasks. The winter green manure, which matures in the first season this year, is the capital for southern regions to strive for a great leap forward in the output of more than 100 million mu of early rice this year. The total output of wheat, broad beans, peas, etc., is about 50 billion jin, which can provide early rations in the season when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet in, reducing the difficulties of the state and the people, and is also of great significance for striving for a bumper harvest in autumn.
　　Since the beginning of winter, many regions have done a lot of work in this season's production. Some wheat-producing areas in the Yellow River Basin and the Huai River Basin, after carrying out drought-resistant sowing last autumn, immediately responded to the Party and the state's call for increased production and launched a large-scale wheat high-yield campaign. Shandong Province has designated more than 20 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields this year. Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Shanxi and other provinces also have large-scale high-yield fields. In some areas, the area of wheat watering and top dressing has exceeded more than half of the total wheat field area. Jiangsu Province has top-dressed more than 52 million mu of summer-ripening crops, more than four times that of the previous year. Field management of rapeseed, broad beans, peas and green manure crops is generally also done well.
　　Their efforts have not been in vain, and wheat is growing very well in most areas now. Rapeseed in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Guizhou and other places already has six or seven true leaves, and is growing more vigorously than in the same period last year. The 55 million mu of wheat crops in Jiangsu Province as a whole have surpassed the particularly good growth of 1956 since liberation. This is a great good news for this year's agricultural production. Judging from the existing achievements and the enthusiasm of the masses in these areas, a great leap forward in wheat production can be realized this year.
　　However, this year's field management of wheat and rapeseed cannot fully meet the requirements for a substantial increase in production. Some provinces have proposed to produce wheat equivalent to 40 million mu of general fields on 20 million mu of high-yield fields this year; some provinces have proposed one mu is equivalent to two mu, and two mu is equivalent to three mu. Many rapeseed producing areas have also proposed higher production increase targets. Xupu County in Hunan, which has 100,000 mu of rapeseed, plans to become a 100-jin county for rapeseed this year. However, some of these areas that are preparing to increase output by half, double or even more have not yet put in the effort required to substantially increase output. Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Zhentou Township, Liuyang County, Hunan, found that among the cooperative's 1,200 mu of rapeseed and wheat, 325 mu were growing very poorly and 75 mu were trampled by chickens and ducks when checking winter production. In addition, hundreds of mu of wheat and rapeseed have been left unattended since sowing. An old farmer in the cooperative said: If this continues, the wheat will yield at most 80 jin, and the rapeseed will not exceed 50 jin. This figure is less than half of the cooperative's planned output. Similar situations may exist everywhere, so it is necessary to seize the time to check once and take measures to quickly remedy them.
　　The establishment of large-scale high-yield fields is an innovation in China's agricultural production. These high-yield fields can not only produce a lot of wheat, but also play the role of high-yield banners, promoting a great leap forward in wheat production; but we cannot therefore ignore the general wheat fields that are several times larger than the area of high-yield fields. If we only care about high-yield fields and ignore general fields, we cannot guarantee an overall bumper harvest, and the plan to increase wheat production will fail.
　　From now until the harvest of winter crops, there are generally three or four months left. During this period, these crops may also be attacked by natural disasters such as late frost, spring drought, and diseases and insect pests. In 1953, a late frost damaged 100 million mu of wheat in the four provinces of Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan. In 1955, millions of mu of rapeseed in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River suffered a complete crop failure due to frost. These situations show that even if certain achievements have been made in winter crop field management, the road to striving for a bumper harvest of winter crops is only halfway through, and we must not be paralyzed.
　　Field management work is the same as other things. We are not afraid of slow progress in the past, but we are afraid of not catching up quickly. Dangshan County, Anhui, originally had a very slow pace of top dressing, and only completed more than 44% of the planned top dressing area by December 26 last year. Later, the Dangshan County Party Committee took emergency measures and mobilized all the labor force in the county that could participate in top dressing to carry out a shock top dressing, which increased by more than 500,000 mu in seven days, resulting in exceeding the originally planned top dressing area by nearly 40%.
　　In winter production, in some areas and units lacking overall arrangements, the field management of winter crops has not received due attention. After entering the stage of spring plowing preparation, this phenomenon may increase. However, if the overall arrangement is well done, field management will not be squeezed out. In Xikou Township, Xuancheng County, Anhui, the entire township completed 3.18 million cubic meters of earthwork in winter last year, overfulfilling the second additional task of water conservancy construction; accumulated more than 43,000 dan of fertilizer; at the same time, all 4,600 mu of winter crops were ditched for drainage; 90% were top-dressed, and 60% were weeded. Isn't the field management here not squeezed out? What is the key? To put it simply, the leaders take care of all aspects of winter production, comprehensively and reasonably arrange labor, and closely integrate various production activities. In fact, the connection between water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and winter field management is very close: the masses dig wells and build canals day and night in order to fight drought and water wheat; at the same time, they are also willing to actively accumulate fertilizer to meet the needs of winter crops. What is needed here is the overall consideration and rational arrangement of various tasks by the leadership.

### 注意冬季作物的田间管理

　　注意冬季作物的田间管理
    去年秋、冬以来，全国播种冬季作物达五、六亿亩，其中包括三亿五千八百万亩小麦，三千六百万亩油菜，五千多万亩绿肥和六千多万亩蚕豆、豌豆等。小麦的种植面积占全国耕地面积五分之一；油菜占整个油料作物面积三分之一。这两种作物的收成好坏，直接影响着今年粮食和油料增产任务的完成。今年头一季成熟的越冬绿肥，是南方地区争取一亿多亩早稻今年产量大跃进的本钱。小麦、蚕豆、豌豆等的总产量有五百亿斤左右，在青黄不接的季节里能早接口粮，减少国家和人民的困难，对争取秋季大丰收也有重要意义。
    入冬以来，许多地区在这一季生产上已作了不少工作。黄河流域、淮河流域的一些产麦区，在去年秋季抗旱播种以后，紧接着响应党和国家的增产号召，开展了大面积小麦丰产运动。山东省今年划定的大面积丰产田有二千多万亩。河北、河南、安徽、山西等省也都有大面积丰产田。有些地区浇麦和追肥的面积已超过麦田总面积的一半以上。江苏省夏熟作物追肥五千二百多万亩，超过上年四倍以上。油菜、蚕豆、豌豆和绿肥作物的田间管理，一般也作得不错。
    他们的力气没有枉费，现在大部分地区的小麦都生长得很好。湖南、江西、安徽、贵州等地的油菜已有六、七片真叶，长得比去年同期茁壮。江苏全省五千五百多万亩麦类作物，超过解放以来生长特好的1956年。这是今年农业生产上的一个大喜讯。从这些地区的已有的成绩和群众的干劲看，今年在小麦生产上的大跃进是可以实现的。
    但是今年小麦、油菜的田间管理工作还不能完全适应大幅度增产的要求。有的省今年提出了在两千万亩丰产田上生产出相当四千万亩一般田的小麦；有的省提出一亩顶二亩，二亩顶三亩。一些油菜产区也多提出较高的增产指标。有十万亩油菜的湖南溆浦县，计划在今年成为油菜百斤县。但是这些准备把产量提高半倍，一倍甚至更多的地区，有的还没有付出大幅度提高产量所需要的力气。湖南浏阳县镇头乡前进农业社，在检查冬季生产的时候，发现全社一千二百多亩油菜、小麦中，有三百二十五亩生长很差，七十五亩被鸡鸭践踏。此外还有几百亩小麦、油菜播种以后一直没人过问。这个社的老农说：这样下去，麦子最多能收八十斤，油菜过不了五十。这个数字不及该社计划产量的一半。类似这样的情形，在各地可能都有，因此，很有必要抓紧检查一次，并且采取措施，迅速予以补救。
    大面积丰产田的建立，是我国农业生产上的创举。这些丰产田不但可以增产很多的小麦，而且可以发挥丰产旗帜的作用，促进小麦生产大跃进；但是我们不能因此忽视比丰产田面积大几倍的一般麦田。如果只顾丰产田，忽略了一般田，那就不能保证全面丰收，增产小麦的计划就会落空。
    由现在起到冬季作物收获，一般还有三、四个月。在这个时期里，这些作物还可能受到晚霜、春旱、病虫等自然灾害的侵袭。1953年一场晚霜，冻坏了安徽、山东、江苏、河南四个省的一亿亩小麦。1955年长江中游有几百万亩油菜因受冻颗粒无收。这些情况说明，在冬季作物田间管理上即使取得了一定成绩，但争取冬季作物大丰收的路程也还只是走完一半，决不可以麻痹大意。
    田间管理工作也和别的事情一样，不怕过去脚步迟缓，而怕不急起直追。安徽砀山县原来追肥进度很慢，到去年12月26日才完成计划追肥亩数的44％多。后来砀山县委采取紧急措施，发动起全县所有能够参加追肥的人力突击追肥，七天就增加了五十多万亩，结果超过原订追肥计划亩数近40％。
    在冬季生产中，在缺乏全面安排的部分地区和单位，冬季作物的田间管理工作没有受到应有的重视。在进入春耕准备阶段以后，这种现象还可能增加。但是，如果全面安排得好，田间管理是不会被挤掉的。安徽宣城县溪口乡在去年冬季全乡作了三百十八万土方工程，超额完成了第二次追加的兴修水利任务；积肥四万三千多担；与此同时，四千六百多亩冬季作物也全部铲了排水沟；90％追了肥，60％锄了草。这里的田间管理不是没有被挤掉吗？关键是什么？简单说就是：领导人员照顾到了冬季生产的各个方面，全面地合理地安排了劳力，使各项生产紧密结合进行。事实上，修水利、积肥和冬季田间管理之间的关连是很密切的：群众为了抗旱浇麦，就星夜打井修水渠；同时也愿意积极积肥来满足冬季作物的需要。这里所需要的，就是领导上对于各项工作的统筹兼顾，合理安排。
