    Reflections on a Ragpicker
    Zhu Shisheng, Hunan Normal College

    For the past year or two, the person who has impressed me most at the entrance of our college is an old ragpicker. He's in his fifties, with a small, swallow-wing-like mustache and shrewd eyes. He comes to the school gate every two or three days, always before lunchtime. He always puts his carrying pole down at the gatekeeper's office and then calls out in a special tone: "Selling old clothes, old cotton wadding, old shoes and socks, scrap metal for money!"

    Recently, I haven't seen him much, for some reason. Maybe two or three times a month. One day he came, and I sold him some empty toothpaste tubes that I had saved up. He suddenly asked me, "Why are there fewer people selling old clothes these days, but more people selling empty toothpaste tubes?"

    My spirit was suddenly shaken. This old ragpicker's eyes are indeed very shrewd. This simple question summarizes the changes in the lives of us college students.

    So, I remembered something that happened before. It was also related to this old ragpicker. In the past, many students sold things to this old man. In my memory, they all complained that the old man paid too little, but they were unwilling to argue about the price, and they seemed very afraid of being seen by others. Some were arguing about the price, but as soon as they saw someone coming, they would blush and take the small amount of money away.

    So I paid attention and observed that among the things sold by the students, some were indeed useless waste, but some were still wearable old clothes. One day, I finally asked a classmate who had just sold some old clothes, "Can't these clothes still be worn? Why sell them as rags?" Unexpectedly, he said coldly, "If the old doesn't go, the new won't come; if I don't sell the old, how can I apply for new ones?" Then he added conciliatorily, "But you can't look at college students with the eyes of a middle school student anymore; since you can apply for clothes, why wear them too shabbily? College students can't be that poor!"

    I was a little stunned at the time. I was a new student, and this classmate graduated from the same middle school as me, but he was one grade higher. Although I felt uncomfortable with his advice, and to be honest, I still couldn't get used to it; but I felt that since I was going to apply for new ones, the old ones were indeed useless, and besides, it was related to the important matter of "the shabbiness of college students." So I didn't say anything. After a long time, it seemed like I got used to it. This can be regarded as a small, unqualified test for me.

    The situation has certainly changed now. It was probably around the time when the old ragpicker reduced the number of times he came to the school. At a discussion meeting of a socialist education class (a new course started in the second half of 1957), a classmate made the following statement: "Just giving one example can illustrate how much my ideology and feelings need to be transformed. Last winter, when applying for cotton clothes, I originally had a cotton coat, but it was torn in one place on the lapel. It could be worn perfectly well with a little mending, but I sold it to the ragpicker. When I sold it, because the old man gave too little money, I also thought that I shouldn't sell it, and just put a patch on it and wear it again; but the old man said: 'Comrade, what's the use of keeping the clothes, you can't wear patched clothes, can you?' This sentence just hit my weakness. I thought, yes, it is indeed too embarrassing to wear patched clothes. As a result, I sold it. This shows how far my ideology and feelings are from the working people. The working people are diligent and thrifty, they laugh at rotten clothes but not at patched ones, but I sold clothes that could be worn and used their hard-earned money to show off; moreover, I sold it for a small amount of money and then received a large sum of money in return. What a stark contrast!"

    Change started like this. Among the students, the number of people wearing old clothes and clothes with patches is gradually increasing. At the school gate, in addition to the old woman who used to mend clothes, there is now a middle-aged woman who uses a sewing machine to alter and mend old clothes. The old ragpicker has been relegated to last place. For some reason, college students have turned their attention to those toothpaste tubes that they used to despise. This is the reason why there are fewer people selling old clothes and more people selling empty toothpaste tubes.

    The fire of anti-waste has been burning in various universities. May the ideas of "the shabbiness of college students" and the like be burned away as well!

### 收破烂的总结

    收破烂的总结
    湖南师范学院　朱石生
    一两年来，在我们学院门口，给我印象最深的，是一个收破烂的老头。五十多岁年纪，两撇小燕翅膀样的胡子，一双精明的眼睛。三两天总要来学校门前一次，而且总是吃午饭前来，来了总是把担子在传达室门口一放，接着便总是用一种特别的声调叫道：“破衣服、破棉絮、破鞋袜、破铜烂铁的卖钱啰！”
    近来不知为了什么，很少见到他了。一个月见不到二三回。一天他来了，我把攒下的一些空牙膏瓶去卖给他。他忽然问我：“怎么如今卖旧衣服的人少了，卖空牙膏瓶的人反倒多起来？”
    我的精神忽然有所震动。这个收破烂的老头的眼睛，的确是十分精明的。这句简单的问话，对我们大学生的生活变化作了总结。
    于是，我想起了以前的一件事。那也是同这个收破烂的老头有关的。以前，有不少同学把东西卖给这个老头。在我的印象里，他们都埋怨这个老头付钱太少，但又都不肯去争价钱，而且似乎很怕别的人看见，有些在争着价钱，一见到有人来了，便也红着脸把少少的一些钱拿走。
    我于是留神观察，在同学们卖出的东西中，果然有些是留着无用的废物，但有些却是仍然可以穿用的旧衣服。一天，我终于问一个刚刚卖过一些旧衣服的同学：“这些衣服不是还能穿吗？为什么要当破烂卖掉呢？”不料他却冷冷地说：“旧的不去，新的不来嘛；不卖了旧的，怎能去申请新的呢？”接着他又和解地说：“不过，你也不能再用中学生的眼光来看大学生；既然可以申请到衣服，干吗要穿得太不像样了呢？大学生不能那样太寒酸了啊！”
    我当时听得有点发楞。我还是新入学的，这位同学，同我毕业于一个中学，但比我高着一个年级。对于他的指教，虽然也觉得不舒服，老实说是还有些看不惯；但觉得既然是要申请新的，旧的确实也就没用了，何况还干连到“大学生的寒酸气”的大事。于是便没说什么。一久，好像也就有些看惯了似的。这也算是我的一次小小的不合格的考验吧。
    现在的情况当然变了。大概就是收破烂老头减少来校次数的那个时候吧。在一次社会主义教育课（这是1957年下半年新开的课程）的讨论会上，一个同学作了这样一段发言：“只要举出一个例子，就能说明我的思想感情是多么需要改造。去年冬天申请棉衣时，我本来有一件棉衣，只是在衣襟上撕破了一处，稍加补缀是完全可以穿的，可是我却把它卖给收破烂的了。卖的时候，因为老头子出钱太少，我也曾想到不应该卖它，打个补钉再穿；可那老头子说：‘同学，衣服留着有什么用，难道还打补钉穿不成？’他这一句正好刺中了我的弱点，我想是呀，穿补钉衣服确实太过意不去。结果还是卖了。这说明我的思想感情离劳动人民有多远，劳动人民是勤俭朴素的，他们笑烂不笑补，而我却把能穿的衣服卖掉，拿他们的血汗钱讲排场；而且，我既卖得了一小点钱，又反过来领来了一大笔钱。这是多么鲜明的对比啊！”
    变化就是这样开始的。同学当中，穿旧衣服的和穿有补钉衣服的人，现在是逐渐多起来了，学校的门口，除了原来的一个缝补衣服的老妇人以外，又添了一个用缝纫机改补旧衣服的中年妇女，收破烂的老头已是退居末位的了。不知怎的，大学生们都反倒注意起那些过去瞧不起的牙膏瓶来。这便是卖旧衣服的人少了，卖空牙膏瓶的人多了起来的原因。
    反浪费之火，已在各个大学里燃烧起来，但愿把那“大学生寒酸气”之类的思想也一起烧掉吧！
