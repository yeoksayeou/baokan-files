　　Postscript
    More than 15,000 middle school students in the Handan area have drawn up personal labor plans to strengthen labor and promote the leap forward in agriculture. This is a good way to further implement the integration of work and study during the holidays. Currently, middle schools in various regions are beginning their winter vacations. The method of middle school students in the Handan area is worth learning from on how to practically arrange for students to participate in labor and carry out work-study programs.
    In the process of formulating work-study plans, more than 5,000 students in the Handan area proposed not making new cotton clothes, but dyeing the old ones, and investing the money saved in agricultural cooperatives. This not only enhanced the socialist consciousness of the majority of students and promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also cultivated the students' spirit of hard work, simplicity, and thrift.
    It is worth greatly advocating for students to make personal work-study plans during the holidays.

　　编后记
    邯郸地区一万五千多名中学生，订出加强劳动，促进农业跃进的个人劳动计划。这是假期里进一步贯彻勤工俭学的好办法。目前各地中学正在开始放寒假，如何切实安排学生参加劳动，进行勤工俭学，邯郸地区中学生的办法，是值得学习的。
    邯郸地区的中学生，在制订勤工俭学计划中，有五千多名学生提出，不做新棉衣，把旧的染一下，节省下来的钱向农业社投资。这不仅提高了广大学生的社会主义觉悟，促进农业生产大跃进，同时培养了学生们艰苦朴素勤俭的作风。
    学生在假期中订个人勤工俭学计划，是值得大大提倡的。
