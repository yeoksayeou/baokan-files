Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 14th (Reporter Li Nan): February is the peak of winter in the Soviet Union. The Russian fields are covered in white snow, and Moscow is adorned in silver, appearing particularly crystal clear and charming. Sometimes there is heavy snowfall, and sometimes bright sunshine. Starting from the 14th, people are celebrating a holiday with ancient traditions – the Russian Winter Festival.

From the ancient Russian era, the week starting on February 14th has been a festival with strong folk characteristics. During this week, people hold many ancient customary activities, just like the Chinese Spring Festival. During the festival, Russian families all fry pancakes to entertain guests, young women choose this time as the date for their weddings, villagers travel along the village in troikas and sleighs, beautiful and cheerful folk songs ripple in front of every household’s window, young people ride horses over bonfires, or go skiing on high mountains. From this year on, this ancient festival has been officially named "Russian Winter Festival," and large-scale activities will be held everywhere. Some ancient customs have been restored, and the festival will be more fulfilling and meaningful.

The Moscow Russian Winter Festival starts on the 14th and lasts for ten days at the Lenin Stadium. The stadium entrance, boulevards, and squares have been decorated for the festival, with snowmen everywhere. People in the stadium will see the old proverb "Everyone is young in the winter cold" praising the Russian winter. According to folk customs, people can eat thin pancakes and drink hot tea on the snowy boulevards. Troikas and sleigh trains are constantly running on the snow, and sometimes there are sleds pulled by northern deer and hunting dogs.

Soviet people, especially Russians, love the cold winter and also love this winter festival. In most parts of the Soviet Union, the winter is severely cold. Moscow sometimes drops to minus thirty degrees Celsius, but even in the coldest weather, construction work in Moscow has not been interrupted. Cranes are stretching their giant arms in the heavy snow. Snowplows are constantly traveling back and forth on the streets, and the streets are cleaned up as soon as the snow stops. Heating workers closely monitor changes in temperature, and no matter what the weather, Moscow people's homes remain equally warm.

In winter, the fine qualities of diligence, courage, and cheerfulness of the Russian people can be seen in winter festival activities.

    在冬季的严寒里大家都年青
    苏联人开始过“俄罗斯冬节”
    像我国春节一样民间色彩很浓厚
    新华社莫斯科14日电　本社记者李楠报道：二月是苏联冬季的顶点。俄罗斯的原野上复盖着白雪，莫斯科全城都是银妆素裹，分外显得晶莹妩媚。这里有时是大雪纷飞，有时又是晴阳灿烂。从14日起，人们开始欢度一个有古老传统的节日——俄罗斯冬节。
    从古老的俄罗斯时代起，由2月14日开始的一个星期就是一个民间色彩很浓厚的节日。人们在这个星期里举行许多古老的习俗活动，就像中国的春节一样。在节日期间，俄罗斯人家家煎薄饼招待客人，少女们选择这个时候作为出嫁的日期，乡亲们驾着三马套车和雪橇沿村出游，优美的愉快的民歌在家家户户的窗前荡漾，青年们骑着马从篝火上飞跃而过，或者到高山上去滑雪。从今年起，这个古老的节日被正式定名为“俄罗斯冬节”，各地将举行大规模的活动，一些古老的习俗恢复了，节日将过得更充实和更有意义了。
    莫斯科的俄罗斯冬节从14日起共有十天，在列宁运动场举行。运动场的入口、林荫道和广场都已经披上了节日的盛装，到处都是雪人。人们在运动场上会看到“在冬季的严寒里大家都年青”这句赞美俄罗斯冬季的古谚，按照民间的风俗，人们可以在大雪纷飞的林荫道上吃到薄油饼和喝到热茶。三马套车和雪橇列车不断地在雪地上奔跑，有时还出现用北方的鹿和猎狗拖的雪橇。
    苏联人，特别是俄罗斯人很喜爱严寒的冬季，也很喜爱这个冬季的节日。苏联大部分地区冬天是严寒的，莫斯科有时冷到零下三十度，但是，就是在最冷的时候，莫斯科的建筑工作也没有间断过，起重机在大风雪中舒展着巨臂。扫雪车不断在街上来往，大雪一停街道上便收拾得干干净净。暖气工人密切注意着气温的变化，不管什么天气，莫斯科人的房屋都保持着同样的温暖。
    在冬天，在冬季的节日活动中都可以看出俄罗斯人的勤劳、勇敢和愉快的优良品质。
