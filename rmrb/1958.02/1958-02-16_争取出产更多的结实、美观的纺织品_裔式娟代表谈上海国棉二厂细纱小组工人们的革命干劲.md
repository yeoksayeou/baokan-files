I fully agree with the reports of the four responsible comrades and will resolutely implement them.

Currently, the people of the whole country are carrying out rectification and socialist education movements, vehemently opposing conservative thinking and waste, and further launching a high tide of the movement to increase production and practice economy, which is a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. I would like to talk about the situation of our fine spinning group in Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 at this solemn conference, in order to get more help from everyone.

How have we been rated as an advanced group for four consecutive years?

In recent years, under the leadership and cultivation of the Party, and relying on the continuous improvement of class consciousness and labor enthusiasm of all members of the group, we have comprehensively completed the first Five-Year Plan, and in particular, have relatively well completed the product quality indicators and savings plan. During the first Five-Year Plan period, we successively promoted and created eighteen advanced experiences, and the ability to manage machines was increased by 26 percent compared with 1953. Therefore, our group has been rated as an advanced group in Shanghai for four consecutive years.

Not long ago, we summarized and inspected our work over the past five years. We realized that in order to maintain the advanced level of the group, we should do the following:

Doing a good job in ideological education, workers' consciousness is raised and they produce actively

First, we must always do a good job in political and ideological education, constantly understand and help solve ideological problems in the group, and improve everyone's class consciousness and understanding. For example, when the State Council promulgated the document on extending the apprenticeship period [Interim Provisions (Draft) on the Study Period and Living Allowances of Apprentices in State-owned, Joint State-Private, Cooperative-operated, and Individually-operated Enterprises and Institutions], everyone in our group enthusiastically supported it during the discussion, but an old worker in the group raised objections. The reason was that she had a son who was an apprentice, and she originally hoped that her son could become a formal worker quickly, so that he could take more money home and live a better life. Through debate, presenting facts, and reasoning, a comparison was made between workers' lives before and after liberation: before liberation, it was impossible to maintain one person's life, let alone take care of children! But it is different after liberation. A worker can support several people, and children can also learn culture and technology. In addition, with stable prices and labor insurance benefits, our lives are very good. After this explanation, she understood and smiled happily, feeling that this regulation was to encourage young people not only to improve their skills, but also to master technology more comprehensively. She realized that her original idea was only considering immediate interests, which was wrong, and she was more at ease and active in production.

Oppose Conservatism, Exchange Experience
Learn from Each Other, Improve Technical Level

Second, attach importance to improving technology and oppose conservatism. To have good production, it is not only necessary to have revolutionary drive, but also to have technical skills and constantly overcome conservative thinking. In order to meet the needs of the people, we once used the method of speeding up the machines in 1954 to tap potential and improve product quality. After the speed was increased, the workers were very nervous and felt busy. However, we found that Comrade Hua Shuzhen in our group was calm and worked in a planned way, and the task was completed very well. At this time, we felt that it was not enough to complete the task simply by strengthening labor intensity, and we must improve technology. Seeing that Hua Shuzhen must have a good method, we suggested that the administration summarize her experience and exchange it. Through the exchange, everyone improved their skills, and production steadily advanced. Because we realized the importance of improving technology, many comrades also made guarantees: Teach others without being conservative; Learn from others with great modesty. For example, Comrade Wang Guiying has good roving piecing skills. Seeing that Wang Sanbao's skills were low, she took the initiative to patiently teach Wang Sanbao by holding her hand. In this way, we learned from each other, helped each other, learned from each other's strengths and compensated for weaknesses, and improved together, and constantly improved the technical level.

Help Each Other, Care for Each Other
Overcome Difficulties, Increase Production Enthusiasm

Third, overcome difficulties, strive for advancement, unite and help each other, and care for each other. Except for two male comrades, most of our group are female workers, some have many children, and some are pregnant, and there are many difficulties, but we still complete our tasks very well. This is mainly because we all care about production, are unwilling to lag behind, strive for advancement, and the vast majority of comrades can complete the plan on a monthly basis. This tenacious spirit is also manifested in cultural learning. We have eliminated illiteracy, some have graduated from elementary school, and some have reached junior high school. In life, we can all take the initiative to overcome difficulties and care for each other. There is a mother of four children in our group. In order to care for her comrades, she often sacrifices her rest time to visit the group members, so that she can understand the situation and strengthen mutual assistance and unity. For example, an old worker in the group was not energetic during production. Through the visit, it was learned that she did not have a clock at home, did not know the time to go to work, and sometimes got up at two o'clock in the middle of the night, which affected her health. After everyone knew about this, they pooled more than twenty yuan to buy a clock from a second-hand store and gave it to her first, which made her very moved and her production enthusiasm was even higher.

Constantly Overcome Complacency
Constantly Learn Advanced Experience from Other Factories

Fourth, we must also learn humbly and constantly fight against arrogance and complacency. At the end of last year, on the basis of successfully completing the first Five-Year Plan, we initially formulated the indicators for the second Five-Year Plan. At the same time, through inspecting the work, we also found some shortcomings. For example, some comrades saw that the group had been rated as an advanced group for several consecutive years, and there was complacency. On New Year's Day this year, at the celebration meeting of advanced production (work) workers in Shanghai, I represented the group in proposing the conditions for friendly competition to the groups of textile enterprises in the city, which aroused enthusiastic responses from many groups. At that time, we thought that the indicators we set were advanced. A few days later, we heard that the Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 5 Ye Huamei group had set some indicators that were more advanced than ours. For example, the white spots on the joints, we set 4 percent, they only set 2 percent, so we hurriedly held a meeting to study and check whether our indicators were conservative, further analyzed the production situation, and explored the production potential, and revised the indicators. After that, we also sent more than ten comrades to the Ye Huamei group to learn in person. After returning to the factory, we learned their advanced experience and set the white spots on the joints to be less than 2 percent. Now, nine of the twelve roving frame operators in our group will eliminate white spots on the joints in the first quarter of this year, and will help the remaining people to eliminate white spots on the joints in the second quarter. Through this incident, we have more deeply realized the profound meaning of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Modesty helps people to make progress, and arrogance makes people lag behind." We must constantly fight against conservative and complacent emotions, so our whole group unanimously expressed: Wherever there is advancement, we will go there to learn. Only by always maintaining this momentum of finding advancement, comparing advancement, learning advancement, and catching up with advancement can we make continuous progress.

Our factory has decided to use domestic cotton to trial-spin 120-count and 150-count high-grade cotton yarn this year, and produce high-grade poplin, striving for a great leap forward in quality.

At present, our group has a strong revolutionary drive and high labor enthusiasm. We are determined to further implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and running households diligently and thriftily, and we must always maintain this atmosphere in production and life. Our factory has already decided to use domestic cotton to trial-spin 120-count and 150-count high-grade cotton yarn this year, and make high-grade poplin, striving for a great leap forward in quality, producing more durable, strong, and beautiful textiles to supply the needs of the people, and accumulating more funds for the country.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have full confidence in realizing the second Five-Year Plan. Although our group has many female comrades and many difficulties, we are still full of confidence and forging ahead, ensuring that we will achieve a bumper harvest in production, technology, ideology, and culture in 1958.

    争取出产更多的结实、美观的纺织品
    裔式娟代表谈上海国棉二厂细纱小组工人们的革命干劲
    我完全同意四位负责同志的报告并坚决贯彻。
    目前全国人民正在展开整风和社会主义教育运动，都在轰轰烈烈地反对保守思想，反对浪费现象，进一步开展增产节约运动，掀起了工农业生产大跃进的高潮。我愿意在这个庄严的大会上谈谈我们上海国棉二厂细纱小组的情况，以便取得大家更多的帮助。
    我们是怎样连续四年  被评为先进小组的？
    几年来，我们小组在党的领导和培养下，依靠全组同志不断地提高阶级觉悟和劳动热情，全面地完成了第一个五年计划，特别是比较好地完成了产品质量指标和节约计划。在第一个五年计划期间，我们先后推广并创造了十八项先进经验，管理机台的能力比一九五三年提高了百分之二十六。因此，我们小组连续四年被评为上海市的先进小组。
    不久以前，我们曾经总结和检查了五年来的工作，我们体会到要使小组保持先进水平，应该做好这样几件工作：
    做好了思想教育工作  工人觉悟提高积极生产
    第一，要时刻做好政治思想教育工作，经常了解和帮助解决小组里的思想问题，提高每个人的阶级觉悟和认识。比如在国务院公布了延长学徒年限的文件〔关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营企业和事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定（草案）〕，我们组在讨论时，大家都热烈拥护，可是组里也有一个老工人提出不同意。原因是她有个儿子是个徒工，她本来希望儿子能够很快成为正式工，可以多拿些钱回家，把生活过得更好些。通过争辩，摆事实，讲道理，拿解放前后工人生活作了对比：解放前一个人的生活也维持不下去，那里还顾得了子女呢！可是解放后不同了，一个工人可以维持几个人的生活，子女还能够学习文化，学习技术，再加上物价稳定，劳保福利，我们生活过得蛮好。这样一讲，她弄通了，高兴得笑了起来，感到这个规定是鼓励青年，不仅要提高技术，而且还要更全面地掌握技术，知道了自己原来的想法是只顾了眼前利益，是错误的，生产上也更安心积极了。
    反对保守　交流经验
    互相学习　提高技术水平
    第二，重视提高技术，反对保守。要使生产好，不仅要有革命干劲，而且要有技术本领，不断地克服保守思想。为了满足人民的需要，因此我们曾经在一九五四年以加快车子速度的办法来挖掘潜力，提高产品质量。加快车速后，工人都非常紧张，感到忙乱。可是我们发现组里花淑贞同志却不慌不忙，有计划地进行工作，而且任务完成得很好，这时我们感到仅仅靠加强劳动强度来完成任务是不行的，必须提高技术。看看花淑贞一定有好的办法，便建议行政总结她的经验，并作了交流。通过交流，大家提高了技术，生产也稳步前进了。由于我们认识到提高技术的重要性，许多同志还提出了保证：教别人，毫不保守；学别人，十分虚心。如王桂英同志的镶粗纱技术好，她看到王三宝的技术低，便主动地、耐心地把着王三宝的手教她。就这样，我们互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高，不断地提高了技术水平。
    互相帮助　互相关心  克服困难　提高生产热情
    第三，克服困难，争取先进，团结互助，互相关心。我们小组除两个男同志外，多数是女工，有的孩子很多，有的正在怀孕，困难不少，但我们仍然会很好的完成任务。这主要是由于我们大家都关心生产，不甘落后，争取先进，绝大多数同志都能够按月完成计划。在文化学习上也表现了这种顽强精神，我们已经消灭了文盲，有的已高小毕业，有的到了初中。在生活上我们都能够主动地克服困难，及互相关心。我们组里有一位四个孩子的母亲，她为了关心同志，常常是牺牲自己的休息时间，去访问组员，这样便了解了情况，加强了互助团结。如组里一个老工人在生产时精神不足，通过访问，了解了她家里原来没有钟，上班不知道时间，有时半夜二点钟就起来，影响了身体健康。这件事被大家知道后，就合凑了二十多元钱到旧货商店去买了一只钟先给她用，使得她很受感动，生产热情更高了。
    不断克服骄傲自满情绪
    不断学习别厂先进经验
    第四，还要虚心学习，不断和骄傲自满情绪作斗争。去年年底，我们在胜利完成第一个五年计划的基础上，初步制定了第二个五年计划指标。同时，我们通过检查工作，也找出了一些缺点。如有的同志看到小组连续几年被评为先进小组，便存在着自满情绪。今年元旦，我在上海市的先进生产（工作）者庆祝大会上，曾代表小组向全市纺织企业的小组提出了开展友谊竞赛的挑战条件，引起了许多小组的热烈响应。当时，我们认为订的指标是先进的，隔了几天，我们听到了上海国棉五厂叶华妹小组制定的有些指标比我们更先进。如接头白点，我们订百分之四，她们只订百分之二，我们就急忙开会研究，检查我们的指标是否保守，进一步分析了生产情况，发掘了生产潜力，重新修订了指标。之后，我们还推派了十多个同志亲自去叶华妹小组学习。回厂后，我们学习了她们的先进经验，并把接头白点订为百分之二以下。现在我们小组十二个挡车工中有九个人要在今年第一季度消灭接头白点，并要帮助其余的人在第二季度消灭接头白点。通过这一事情，使我们更加体会到毛主席教导我们说的：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”这句话的深刻意义，我们必须时时刻刻和保守自满情绪作斗争，因此我们全小组都一致表示：那里有先进，就到那里去学习。只有经常保持这种找先进、比先进、学先进、赶先进的劲头，才能使我们取得不断的进步。
    我们厂决定今年用国产棉花试纺一百二十支和一百五十支的高级棉纱，生产高级府绸，争取在质量上来个大跃进。
    目前我们小组革命干劲很足，劳动热情很高。我们决心进一步贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的方针，而且要经常在生产中和生活中保持这种风气。我们厂里已经决定在今年用国产棉花试纺一百二十支和一百五十支高级棉纱，并制成高级府绸，争取在质量上来个大跃进，生产出更多的结实、坚固和美观的纺织品供应人民的需要，并为国家积累更多的资金。
    在党和毛主席的领导下，我们有充分信心来实现第二个五年计划。我们小组虽然女同志很多，困难不少，但是我们仍然是满怀信心地奋勇前进，保证一九五八年在生产上、技术上、思想上和文化上都获得丰收。
