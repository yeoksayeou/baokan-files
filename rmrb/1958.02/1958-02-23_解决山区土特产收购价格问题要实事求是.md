    Solving the Problem of Purchase Prices for Mountainous Area Specialty Products Requires Being Realistic
    Zhou Jun
    China has vast mountainous areas, rich resources, and is a production base for local and special products. Since the Party called for advancing into the mountains, many county and district supply and marketing cooperatives have turned their attention to the mountainous areas, organizing deep mountain resource exploration teams to survey remote mountain peaks and discovering many new products, many of which have important economic value. If these abundant resources can be utilized as much as possible, it will not only be of great significance for supporting national economic construction and exports but also greatly increase the income of people in mountainous areas and improve their lives.
    However, the current situation is that the purchase prices of some local and special products are too low. According to investigations, there are 63 kinds of local products and waste products in the Hengyang Special Zone of Hunan Province whose prices are too low. In Dexing County, Jiangxi Province, the purchase prices of major local and special products are generally 12%-14% lower. Similar situations exist in other regions. The unreasonable prices of many local and special products inevitably affect the enthusiasm of farmers in mountainous areas to produce these products.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions, especially those near mountainous areas, in order to cooperate with the development of the mountain economy and quickly develop the production of local and special products in mountainous areas, have begun to adjust prices. However, there are two completely different measures in practice. One is to not go to the production area to investigate and study, to understand the situation, and regardless of whether the purchase price is too low, blindly advocate raising prices; attempting to simply use the method of raising purchase prices to stimulate production in order to achieve the purpose of purchasing more. Experience has proven that this approach not only fails to stimulate production but instead destroys production and affects purchasing work. For example, in some places, the bamboo purchasing plan was not completed, so price increases were used to stimulate it, resulting in the felling of some bamboo near the mountains that was not suitable for felling. In fact, the reason why the purchasing situation in these places is not good is not because the price is low, but because there is no bamboo suitable for felling near the mountains. Bamboo in the deep mountains cannot be transported out due to inconvenient transportation and cannot be felled. Some small local products in mountainous areas cannot be brought down the mountain, not because the purchase price is low, but because of transportation problems, but prices have been blindly raised. After the price increase, these local and special products still cannot be transported down the mountain.
    The Xiangtan Special Zone Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hunan Province takes a different approach. They first conduct item-by-item investigations of the resources of local and special products in mountainous areas, conduct specific analyses, and then treat them differently. This special zone conducted research and investigations on 19 agricultural cooperatives and found that the prices of 55 kinds of small local products such as red root, kudzu hemp, and lycoris radiata slices are basically reasonable, and farmers are satisfied. Their labor income is no lower than agricultural income; those with technology and high labor intensity have even higher incomes than agricultural income. Therefore, it was decided that the purchase prices would not be adjusted. The remaining small local products, after specific analysis and differentiation according to different situations, adopted the following five methods to increase farmers' income. First, select delivery points and change the old circulation direction. Wood boards from Hongqiao, Pingjiang, were transported to Changsha for sale at five yuan per load, and after deducting transportation and miscellaneous expenses, the price farmers saw was only one yuan and five jiao. According to the rational circulation direction, after changing to selling in Xiushui, Jiangxi (only a mountain away), it could be sold for eight yuan, and the purchase price for farmers was seven yuan; simply adjusting the circulation direction increased farmers' income by more than three times. Lotus leaves from Lucheng, Linxiang, were transported from Linxiang to Xindi, Hubei (only a river apart), and the purchase price could be increased from two yuan and five jiao to three yuan. Second, processing plants go up the mountain. Some local products are transported down the mountain for processing, resulting in high transportation costs, high costs, and operating losses; if the purchase price is compressed, producers will have no profit. The supply and marketing cooperative moved the processing plant up the mountain to address this situation, and the problem was solved. The Wengjiang District Cooperative of Pingjiang County moved the rosin residue processing plant to Tancen, a production area in the deep mountains, which reduced transportation costs, and the charcoal burned could also be obtained locally. In this way, the purchase price can be increased by 11% per load. After the Shaoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative changed the processing method of lycoris radiata slices in Quanzhou, the processing efficiency increased by two times, and the purchase price increased by five jiao per load, which was very popular among farmers. Third, change packaging and save transportation costs. Some small local products and waste products with large volumes have increased transportation costs due to the high foaming rate. Wugang and Liuyang used wooden presses to compress and tighten the foamy goods, reducing the volume, which can reduce the foaming fee by two-thirds to four-fifths, greatly reducing transportation costs and losses, and the money saved from reducing processing costs can be used to increase purchase prices. Fourth, change price zones and rationally arrange purchase prices. Liuyang County originally adopted the pricing method of "reducing the price difference inch by inch, section by section, and having highs and lows in every store and point" for mountain products. As a result, there were abnormal phenomena such as a difference of ten li, a price of five li, and even three hundred prices for one product without leaving the county. As a result of reducing the price difference inch by inch, the prices of things in the more remote mountainous areas were lower, producers could not get reasonable labor remuneration, and their enthusiasm for production was not high, so the things needed by the country could not be collected. Now, according to different transportation conditions, the county is divided into eight price zones, the prices are more reasonable than before, and farmers are also satisfied. Fifth, repair roads and open rivers to improve transportation conditions. This is an important measure for developing deep mountain resources. A large number of resources such as bamboo and wood are mostly in deep mountain peaks, and transportation is very difficult and cannot be transported out. From the perspective of price, it cannot be solved. Only by improving transportation conditions can materials be transported out. A large number of bamboo and local paper in the deep mountains of the Jiuxi District of Dongkou County, Hunan Province, cannot be transported down the mountain. In order to fundamentally solve the problem of deep mountain resources coming down the mountain, the Dongkou County Supply and Marketing Cooperative spent only 5,000 yuan to blast rocks and dredge streams in Jiuxi, opening a small river that solved the transportation problem. In more than half a year, 600,000 nine-inch bamboo poles were transported out, and 3,000 loads of local paper can be transported out throughout the year. This place alone has increased the country's wealth by more than 350,000 yuan. Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, has abundant bamboo resources, with approximately 10 million or more poles. The county supply and marketing cooperative adopted methods such as building dams to accumulate water, releasing water section by section, blasting rocks and dredging rivers, utilizing water transportation; selecting terrain and slipping down the mountain tops; laying bridges and building frames, and manually transporting them, so that a large number of bamboo poles were transported out of the mountains. Due to the improvement of transportation conditions, the purchasing volume in 1957 can be increased by more than five times compared to 1956.
    Hunan and Zhejiang adopted these methods to solve the price problem of local and special products in mountainous areas, which not only reasonably solved the mountain price and developed mountain production, but also transported a large number of materials down the mountain, increased the country's wealth, and the supply and marketing cooperative can also not lose money or lose less. (The initial investment is large, but with the development and expansion of purchasing business, the situation of losing money can be quickly changed.) Similar good practices should be studied and promoted by supply and marketing departments in mountainous areas across the country.

    解决山区土特产收购价格问题要实事求是
    周钧
    我国山区面积广，资源丰富，是土特产品的生产基地。自从党号召向山区进军后，不少县、区供销合作社即面向山区，组织深山资源勘察队，探查深山背峰，发现了许多新产品，其中不少资源有着重要的经济价值。这些丰富的资源，如能尽量利用，不仅对支援国家经济建设和支援出口需要有着重大的意义，同时，也可大大增加山区人民的收入，提高山区人民的生活。
    但是目前的情况是若干土特产品的收购价格偏低。据调查，湖南衡阳专区的土产、废品等价格偏低的即有六十三种，江西省德兴县主要土特产品收购价格一般低12％—14％。其它地区也有类似情况。由于不少土特产品的价格不合理，势必影响山区农民生产这些产品的积极性。
    各地供销合作社，尤其是靠近山区的供销合作社，为了配合开发山区经济，很快地把山区土特产品的生产发展起来，已开始调整价格。但在做法上却有两种完全不同的措施。一种是不去产地调查研究，摸清底细，不管是否收价偏低，一味主张提价；企图单纯用提高收购价格办法，来刺激生产，以达到多收购的目的。经验证明，这种作法不但不能刺激生产，结果反而破坏了生产，影响收购工作。如有的地方，毛竹收购计划完不成，即用提价来刺激，结果把近山一些不宜采伐的毛竹也采伐了。事实上，这些地方收购情况所以不好，不是因为价格低，而是近山宜伐的毛竹没有了，深山的毛竹由于交通不便，无法运出，不能采伐。有的山区的小土产下不了山，不是收价低，而是交通运输问题，但也盲目提了价。提价后，这些土特产仍然不能下山外运。
    湖南湘潭专区供销社却是另外一种作法。它们对山区土特产资源先逐项调查摸底，具体分析，然后分别对待。这个专区对十九个农业社进行了调查研究，发现红根、葛麻、石蒜片等五十五种小土产价格基本合理，农民满意，其劳动收入均比农业收入不低；有技术及劳动强度大的收入还要高于农业收入。因此决定收购价格均不做调整。其余的小土产，经过具体分析，区别不同情况，采用以下五个办法提高农民的收入。一、选点交货，改变旧的流转方向。平江虹桥的木板，运交长沙出售，每担五元，除去运杂费与农民见面价只有一元五角。根据合理流转方向，改交江西修水出售后（只有一山之隔）可卖八元，收购农民价格为七元；仅仅调整一下流转方向，农民收入就提高了三倍多。临湘陆城荷叶由运临湘改运湖北新堤（只一河之隔），收价可由二元五角提高到三元。二、加工厂上山。有些土产运下山来再加工，运费大，成本高，经营亏本；如压缩收购价格，生产者就无利可图。供销社针对这一情况把加工厂搬上山去，问题就解决了。平江县瓮江区社把松香渣加工厂迁到深山产地谈岑，既降低了运费，所烧的木炭也可就地取材。这样收购价格每担可提高11％。邵阳县供销社在全洲改变石蒜片加工办法后，加工效率提高了二倍，收价每担提高五角，很受农民欢迎。三、改变包装、节约运费。有些体积大的小土产、废品，由于加泡率大，故运输成本增高。武冈、浏阳利用木榨把泡货榨实捆紧，缩小体积，可降低加泡费三分之二到五分之四，大大降低了运输成本和损耗，把降低加工成本的钱用来提高收购价格。四、改变价格区，合理安排购价。浏阳县原来对山区产品价格采取“寸寸节节减差价，处处店、点有高低”的作价办法。因之，出现了十里一差、五里一价，甚至一种产品不出县就有三百个价格的不正常的现象。由于寸寸节节减差价的结果，越是远山区的东西，价格就越低，生产者得不到合理的劳动报酬，生产积极性不高，因而国家需要的东西收不上来。现在根据不同的运输条件，全县划定八个价格区，价格较前合理了，农民也满意了。五、修路开河、改善运输条件。这是开发深山资源的一项重要措施。有些笨重土产如毛竹、木材等大量的资源多在深山高峰，交通十分困难，无法外运。从价格的角度考虑，是无法解决的。只有改善运输条件，才能使物资外运。湖南洞口县?溪区深山里大批毛竹、土纸，无法运下山来。洞口县供销社为了从基本上解决深山资源下山问题，在?溪炸岩、疏溪，只花了五千元，便开了一条小河，解决了运输问题，半年多的时间，就运出九寸左右毛竹六十万根，全年还可运出土纸三千担。只此一地即为国家增加财富三十五万多元。浙江龙泉县毛竹资源丰富，约有一千万支以上，县供销社采取筑坝积水、段段流放，炸岩疏河、利用水运；选择地形、山顶溜放；铺桥搭架、人工拖运等办法，使大批毛竹运出山来。由于改善了运输情况，1957年比1956年的收购量可提高五倍多。
    湖南、浙江采用这些办法解决山区土特产品的价格问题，既合理地解决了山区价格，发展了山区生产，又使大批物资运下山来，增加了国家财富，而供销社又可不赔或少赔。（开始投资较大，但有着收购业务的，发展和扩大就可以很快地改变赔钱的局面。）类似这样好的作法，全国各地山区供销部门都应当研究推广。
