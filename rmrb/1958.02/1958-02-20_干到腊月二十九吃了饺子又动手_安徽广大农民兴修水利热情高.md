    Hefei, February 19th (reported by this newspaper) - The broad masses of cadres and farmers in Anhui Province engaged in water conservancy construction had long proposed to "work until the 29th of the lunar month, and get back to work after eating dumplings." On Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, they put their vows into practice on the water conservancy construction sites.

    On New Year's Eve, from northern Anhui to south of the Yangtze River, construction sites were still brightly lit, and farmers worked diligently through the night. In Dangshan County, 80,000 people were still at work on New Year's Eve. In Yingshang County, more than 10,000 migrant workers digging the Yinghe Sluice Gate celebrated the Spring Festival on the construction site. In Shexian County, more than 1,000 migrant workers at the Yingtouwu Reservoir in Qiankou Township worked for three hours after eating their New Year's Eve dinner; on the morning of the first day, County Magistrate Zhu Aihua and County Party Secretary Liu Hui went to the construction site to express their condolences and participate in the labor, which further boosted the enthusiasm of the migrant workers. In Lujiang County, more than 30,000 people from four districts, including Leqiao District, went to work on the first day. Many cadres across the province used their holidays to engage in water conservancy construction with migrant workers, and some went to rural areas to help farmers plant trees, afforest, and eliminate the four pests. Zhang Yudao, a member of Jinxiu Commune in Dingyuan County, said: "In the past, there were three busy things on New Year's Eve: being busy with celebrating the New Year, being busy eating, and being busy gambling; this year there are still three busy things, but they are being busy with production, being busy with water conservancy construction, and being busy with eliminating the four pests!"

    Many counties have organized various troupes and artistic groups to express their condolences to the migrant workers at the construction sites. Lingbi, Feidong, and other counties organized cultural and recreational activities at the construction sites, enabling the farmers engaged in water conservancy construction to spend a tense but joyful Spring Festival.

    “干到腊月二十九吃了饺子又动手”
    安徽广大农民兴修水利热情高
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省兴修水利的广大干部和农民，老早就提出要“干到腊月二十九，吃了饺子又动手”。农历除夕和正月初一，他们在水利工地上，实践了自己的誓愿。
    除夕的晚上，从淮北到江南，工地上照常灯火通明，农民们连夜紧张劳动。砀山县除夕仍有八万人上工。颍上县颍河闸挖闸民工有一万多人在工地上欢度了春节。歙县潜口乡迎头坞水库一千多民工在除夕吃过年饭以后还干了三小时；初一早晨，县长朱爱华和县委书记刘辉同上工地慰问，并且参加劳动，更加鼓舞了民工的积极性。庐江县乐桥区等四个区在初一上工的有三万多人。全省各地许多干部都利用假期和民工一起兴修水利，有的到农村帮助农民植树造林，除四害。定远县锦绣社的社员张玉道说：“以往除夕有三忙，是忙过年，忙吃，忙赌钱；今年还是有三忙，却是忙生产，忙兴修水利，忙除四害！”
    许多县都组织了各种剧团、文艺团体到工地慰问民工。灵璧、肥东等县都在工地组织了文娱活动，使兴修水利的农民在春节过得紧张而又愉快。
