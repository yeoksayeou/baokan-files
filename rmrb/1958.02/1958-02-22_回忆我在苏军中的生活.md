    Reminiscences of My Life in the Soviet Army
    Chen Guizhou, Major of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    One summer evening in 1941, facing the scorching hot wind, I crossed the ever-roaring Ussuri River and stepped onto the fighting soil of the Soviet Union. Standing under a tall poplar tree, I turned back and gazed for a long time at the dark sky over my motherland. The occasional flickering lights looked so much like the hideous eyes of the Japanese devils, who were entrenched in my hometown, killing, arson, looting grain, and conscripting men, forcing my family to be broken and destroyed. In order to find a chance for revenge, I had no choice but to leave my motherland, my home. I wore a patched-up single layer of clothing, barefoot and empty-handed, walking along the Ussuri River under the scorching sun. When thirsty, I drank river water, and when hungry, I asked Soviet old women for some bread. Finally, near Vladivostok, I found a Soviet Red Army unit. After they understood my intention, they enthusiastically accepted me into the army, assigning me to the third squad of the first platoon of the fourth company of the second battalion of a certain unit of the Far Eastern Military District. In addition to Soviet people, there were many Chinese and Korean comrades in the company. We all couldn't bear the Japanese invaders' devastation and didn't want to be subjugated people, and after many struggles, we came to the Soviet Red Army to serve as soldiers.

    Our company commander, Lieutenant Shanmalabuer, was a young Russian. He was quite tall, with yellow, curly hair, and his cheeks often showed the blue marks of shaving. He didn't like to joke much. Before the war, he was an excellent student at a university in Moscow and could speak ordinary Chinese. He was very serious in the classroom or on the training ground, and at first, I really didn't dare to approach him. One day, after dinner, I was strolling on the grass when he suddenly called me very affectionately and walked alongside me. For some reason, he kept staring at my feet. Later, I realized that the nail on the heel of my shoe was missing, and a piece of leather was like an open mouth, making it difficult to walk. The more he stared at my feet, the more embarrassed I became, and the more I couldn't move my feet. "Chen Guizhou, why don't you get your shoes nailed?" I didn't answer him immediately. At that time, I only had this one pair of boots. If I sent them to the quartermaster, they usually wouldn't be nailed until the next day. What would I wear for training? After the company commander learned of my difficulty, he immediately asked me to get my shoes nailed and immediately went back to his room and took out a pair of boots from under his bed for me to wear. From that time on, I felt that he was very kind to people. He always joined us in games, playing ball, singing, dancing, and everyone talking and laughing without any restraint. During breaks, some comrades would snatch the cigarette he had just lit to smoke, and it didn't matter.

    I remember not long after joining the camp, the company commander took us to take a bath. The bathhouse was a very large room. When entering, the company commander asked us to throw our sweaty shirts and underwear outside the door, which he and an old gatekeeper collected. After we had a good bath, the company commander wanted us to go out through another door. What about the dirty clothes we took off on this side...? While I was hesitating, cheers suddenly came from the front. It turned out that a set of very clean clothes was prepared for everyone at that door, and we just had to put them on. After walking out of the bathhouse, I felt indescribably comfortable. According to the Soviet army's equipment, each of us received two sets of brownish-yellow single-layer clothes, a set of coarse woolen uniforms, a coarse woolen coat, two blankets, a brand-new belt, and shiny leather boots, which looked very majestic when worn. However, we truly became red fighters during those severe days.

    In the summer, the company commander took us to the river. He picked up a stone and threw it into the river to test the depth and loudly asked, "Can you swim across? Those who can swim, raise your hands! Let me count: one, two, three..." He found that most of the comrades had not raised their hands and suddenly said to us very seriously, "Comrades! Now the enemy is on the other side of the river. There is no boat and no bridge. Can we let the enemy run away?" "No!" we replied loudly in unison. "Right! But soldiers who can't swim can only watch the enemy run away. Do you want the enemy to run away? No, that's right! Then hurry up and practice swimming!" His mobilization only took a few minutes, but it had a great effect. We actively started learning. At first, we used wood and broken buckets, lying on them and paddling. The company commander and some comrades who could swim followed closely in a small boat, constantly encouraging us. At first, we were a little afraid of sinking like stones, but gradually we became bold. This river was not wide, but the current was very fast, and the waves were rolling. After a summer of training, no one in the entire company couldn't swim!

    In the winter, each of us received a pair of five-meter-long "skis" and had to learn to ski on the snow. This was very interesting, just like what we saw in the movies. A silver sea, a silver mountain, relying on a pair of "skis" and two poles, we had to ski at a speed of twenty to thirty kilometers per hour. The Soviets called it the "rapid deployment force." At first, we fell a lot, but Comrade Shanmalabuer attached great importance to this training. Not only did he take the lead every time, but he also taught us everything from how to tie shoelaces to how to go uphill. Every time we practiced, he only wore a single layer of clothing and a small hat. "Follow me!" he said, leading the way, sweating all over. We not only learned to ski but also could stop anytime, anywhere, take the rifle from our backs, and use the walking stick to form a gun mount to shoot at the fleeing enemy!

    The company commander didn't allow anyone to fall behind in training. There was a soldier in our squad named Chai Mengchun, who was very impatient and didn't do the movements according to the requirements. He also dug fortifications carelessly, which made the company commander very angry. Once, he summoned all the Communist Youth League members and asked Chai Mengchun to perform his "program." After the company commander gave the order, unexpectedly, Chai Mengchun did very well. The company commander praised him, saying that Chai Mengchun was a very smart soldier and hoped that he would often strictly demand himself and strive to become a Communist Youth League member!

    I remember once during a drill, the platoon was attacking, and when they rushed to a ditch, the company commander suddenly said:
    "Chen Guizhou! You are now the platoon leader, commanding the charge!"
    "...?" I was clearly a soldier, how could I command a platoon? I did hesitate a bit. Only afterward did I understand that the company commander wanted to cultivate our courage and resourcefulness so that we could deal with sudden changes. He was not satisfied with us just knowing how to march when ordered. Comrade Shanmalabuer often said: "I was sent by the Party. I feel a great responsibility because there are Chinese and Korean comrades in my company. If I can't make you excellent soldiers, I will be letting down the Soviet people and the Soviet Communist Party, and I will also be letting down the Chinese people who are suffering!" Whenever we encountered difficulties, when I thought of the company commander's diligent attitude, his deep gaze would emit a powerful heat, encouraging us to overcome the difficulties!

    In the autumn, every Sunday we would go to nearby farms to help with the harvest, walking happily on the vast fields, stepping on the cold dew. The rumbling machines dug up fat potatoes, emitting the fragrance of soil. We put the potatoes into sacks and then loaded them onto trucks. Whenever we did such labor, I was always particularly excited. I saw the Soviet people working with the greatest perseverance in difficult times. They sent most of the grain to the front lines, while they themselves lived on two slices of black bread a day. I saw the sweat of the Soviet old women and was most likely to think of my own parents and the fallen homeland and the robbers rampaging on the territory of my country. When will we be able to completely eliminate the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists...? In the evening, we loved to squeeze into the club—a green tent—to listen to the radio. Constant reports of victory came from the front: "The Red Army's major counteroffensive has begun...! The Red Army has liberated Poland...! The Red Army has liberated Romania...! The end of the Hitler bandits is coming...!"

    It was already the spring of 1945. On this day, it was drizzling lightly, and we were all gathered in the mess hall to listen to reports from heroes from the front. The heroes' deeds took us to the battlefield filled with artillery fire. Our hearts had already flown to Berlin, to the most difficult front where we could establish meritorious service. I don't know who wrote a note to Company Commander Shanmalabuer, asking him to answer when there would be a battle to fight? When can we go to help the Chinese people fight the Japanese devils? Shanmalabuer said very excitedly at the soldiers' meeting: "Comrades! My heart is even more anxious than yours, but we must see clearly that across the Ussuri River are the Japanese invaders. They are not satisfied with plundering China. In Jilin, along the Chinese Changchun Railway, their claws will reach out to us at any time. This is not the rear! Now, the Red Army has reached Berlin, and they will soon be able to free up their hands. Comrades, actively prepare, strive to be the first to eliminate the Japanese invaders, and strive to make contributions!" "Hurrah!" We waved our fists and shouted. When the news of the liberation of Berlin came, our hearts were truly like arrows on a string, ready to shoot at the enemy at any time. Such a day finally came! On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Red Army advanced into Northeast China with overwhelming force. More than one million Japanese invaders were defeated and scattered within a few days. I returned to my homeland, which I had been away from for four years, with the Soviet Red Army. I saw that the Soviet brothers' feet were still covered with the soil under the city of Berlin. They didn't even have time to rest after passing through the post-war homeland, and they didn't even have time to meet their long-separated wives and children. For the liberation of the Chinese people, in order to completely eliminate the fascist robbers, they bravely threw themselves into new battles.

    回忆我在苏军中的生活
    中国人民解放军少校　陈贵周
    1941年夏天的一个晚上，迎着燎人的热风，我渡过了日夜吼叫的乌苏里江，踏上了战斗的苏联国土。站在一棵高大的白杨树下，我回过头来长久地注视着祖国漆黑的上空，那时而隐现的点点灯火，多么像日本鬼子狰狞的眼睛，他们正盘踞在我生长的故乡，杀人放火、抢粮抓丁，逼得我家破人亡。为了寻找复仇的机会，我不能不离开我的祖国，我的家。我穿了一身补了又补的单衣，赤着脚、两手空空，在烈日下沿着乌苏里江行走着，渴了喝江水，饿了向苏联的老妈妈要点面包，终于在海参威附近找到了一支苏联红军，他们问明了我的来意后，便热情地接收我入了伍，把我编入远东军区某部的二营四连一排三班，连里除了苏联人外，还有不少的中国和朝鲜的同志，我们都是不甘忍受日寇的摧残，不愿意当亡国奴，而经历了很多的斗争，跑到苏联红军来当兵的。
    我们的连长山马拉布尔中尉是一个年轻的俄罗斯人，个子挺高，头发黄而卷曲，两腮经常呈现刮掉了胡须的青色印子。他不大爱说笑，战前是莫斯科某大学的优秀学生，会说普通的中国话，他在课堂上或操场上态度都很严肃，起初我真不敢接近他。一天，吃过晚饭，我正在草地上蹓跶，他忽然很亲热地喊我，和我并肩走在一起。不知怎么，他老是瞅着我的脚，后来我才发现鞋后跟的钉子掉了，一块皮子像张开的嘴巴，走起路来很不带劲。他越盯着我的脚，我越不好意思，脚也越挪不动了。“陈贵周，你怎么不把鞋钉好？”我没有立时回答他。当时我只这一双靴子，如果送到司务长那里，一般要第二天才能钉好，我穿什么出操呢？连长同志知道我这个困难后，马上要我去钉鞋，而且立即回到房里从他床底下拿出一双靴子给我换。从这次起，我感到他对人非常亲切，游戏的时候也总是和我们在一起，打球啦、唱歌啦、跳舞啦、大家说说笑笑地没有一点拘束，休息时有的同志把他刚点着的香烟抢来吸，也没有关系。
    记得入营不久，连长领着我们去洗澡，澡塘是一间非常大的屋子，进门的时候，连长要我们把汗油油的衬衣、裤衩都扔在门外，由他和一个看门的老头儿收拣着，等我们痛痛快快洗完了澡，连长却要我们从另外一个门出去，脱在这边的脏衣服怎么办呢……？我正在犹豫的时候，前面忽然传来了欢呼声，原来那边门口为每人准备了一套洗得非常干净的衣服，我们只要穿起来就行了。走出澡塘后，真有说不出的舒坦。我们按照苏军的装备，每人领到两套棕黄色单衣，一套粗呢制服，一件粗呢大衣，还有两条毛毯，崭新的皮带，乌亮的皮靴，穿戴起来可威武了。可是，我们真正成为一个红色的战士，还是在那些严峻的日子里。
    夏天，连长把我们带到河边，他拾起一块石头扔进河中试了试深浅，大声问道：“能不能游过去？能游的同志举手！让我来数：一、二、三……”他发现大部分同志都没有举手，忽然很严肃地向我们说：“同志们！现在敌人就在河对面，没有船也没有桥，我们能不能让敌人跑掉？”“不能！”我们响亮的齐声回答。“对！但是，不能游泳的士兵，只能眼睁睁地看着敌人跑掉，你们愿不愿意敌人跑掉？不，对的！那就赶快练习游泳！”他的动员虽然只花了几分钟，但作用很大，我们积极地展开了学习。起初，利用木头、破桶，伏在上面划，连长和一些会水的同志在后面驾着小船紧紧地跟着，不断地鼓励我们。开始我们还有些害怕像石头一样沉下去，慢慢地就大胆了，这条河并不宽，不过水流很急，浪花滚滚，经过一个夏天的锻炼，全连没有一个不会水的了！
    冬天，我们每人领了一副五公尺长的“踏板”，要学会在雪地滑行，这是很有趣的，就像我们在电影上看到的一样，银色的海、银色的山，就凭一副“踏板”，两根棍子，每小时要滑行二十至三十公里，苏联称为“快速部队”。起初我们摔了不少跤，但是山马拉布尔同志非常重视这一训练，他不但每次都带头，而且从怎样绑鞋带到怎样上坡都教给我们。每逢练习，他都只穿件单衣，戴顶小帽，“跟我来！”说着便在前面开道，滑得浑身都出了汗。我们不但学会了滑行，而且能随时随地停下来，从背上取下长枪，用手杖架成枪架，射击奔逃的敌人！
    连长不允许任何人在操练中掉队，我们班有一个战士叫柴蒙春，性情很急燥，做动作不按要求，挖工事也马马虎虎，这使连长很生气。有一次他召集所有的共青团员，让柴蒙春表演他的“节目”，连长下达口令后，出乎意外，柴蒙春做的很好，连长便表扬了他，说柴蒙春是一个很聪明的战士，希望他经常严格要求自己，争取成为一个共青团员！
    记得有一次演习排进攻，冲到一条水沟旁边，连长忽然说：
    “陈贵周！你现在是一排排长，指挥冲锋！”
    “……？”我明明是一个战士，怎么能指挥一个排呢？我的确有点犹豫，事后才明白连长是为了培养我们的勇敢机智，能对付突然发生的事变，他是不满足于我们只知道听口令开步走的。山马拉布尔同志经常说：“我是党派来的，我的连里有中国和朝鲜同志，使我感到责任重大，如果不能使你们成为一个优秀的战士，我就对不起苏联人民和苏联共产党，也对不起正在苦难中的中国人民！”每当我们碰到了困难的时候，一想起连长勤勤恳恳的态度，他那深邃的目光便发出一股强大的热力，鼓舞我们去克服困难！
    秋天，一到星期天我们便去附近的农庄帮助收割，踏着冰凉的露水，愉快地行走在广阔的原野上。轰隆隆的机器掘起了肥大的马铃薯，散发着泥土的芳香，我们把马铃薯都装入麻袋，然后再搬上汽车，每逢这样的劳动，我的心情总是特别激动，我看到了苏联人民在艰苦的岁月里以最大的毅力从事劳动，他们把粮食大部分都送给前方，自己却以两片黑面包渡日，我看到了苏联老妈妈的汗水，也最容易想起自己的爹娘，想起沦陷的乡土和横行在祖国领土上的强盗，什么时候才能彻底消灭德意日法西斯呢……？晚上，我们爱挤在俱乐部——一个绿色的帐篷里听收音机，前方的捷报不断传来：“红军大反攻开始……！红军解放了波兰……！红军解放了罗马尼亚……！希特勒匪徒的末日到了……！”
    已经是1945年春天了。这天，飘着麻麻细雨，我们都在饭堂里集合，听前方来的英雄们作报告。英雄的事迹把我们带到了炮火连天的战场，我们的心已经飞向柏林，飞到那建立功勋的最艰苦的前方去了。不知道是谁写了一张字条给山马拉布尔连长，请他答复一下，什么时候有仗打？什么时候可以去帮助中国人民打日本鬼子？山马拉布尔在军人大会上非常激动地说：“同志们！我的心比你们还急，但是，要看清楚，隔着乌苏里江就是日寇，他们并不满足于对中国的掠夺，在吉林，在中长路沿线，他们的魔爪随时都会向我们伸来，我们这里并不是后方！现在，红军已抵柏林城下，很快就抽出手来了，同志们积极准备，为消灭日寇而争取打头阵，争取立功吧！”“乌啦！”我们挥动着拳头高呼着，当柏林解放的消息传来后，我们的心真像弦上的箭，时刻都可以射向敌人。这样的日子终于到来了！1945年8月9日，苏联红军以排山倒海之势，向我国东北地区挺进，一百多万日寇，几天之内就被打得落花流水。我随着苏联红军回到了阔别四年的祖国，我看到了苏军兄弟的脚上还沾着柏林城下的泥土，他们路过战后的家园都没有来得及歇脚，久别的妻儿也没有来得及见面，为了中国人民的解放，为了彻底歼灭法西斯强盗，又英勇地投入了新的战斗。
