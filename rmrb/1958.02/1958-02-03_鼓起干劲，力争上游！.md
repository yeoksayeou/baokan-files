　　Opening recent newspapers from various regions is truly exhilarating. News of leaps forward comes one after another, and revolutionary vigor permeates the lines. In the countryside, nearly one hundred million people are advancing on nature, vigorously engaging in water conservancy construction; in the cities, millions of workers in factories and mines are beating the drums of tapping potential, breaking through the original planned targets again and again. All these encouraging good news herald that in 1958 – the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan – the people of our country will win a great victory on all fronts.
　　The thriving and prosperous atmosphere currently present throughout our country demonstrates the new high tide of revolutionary vigor of our people after our socialist revolution has achieved great victories not only in terms of ownership but also on the ideological and political fronts. Our people drove away imperialism, overthrew bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, and completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. These are all glorious achievements of our people's revolutionary struggle. Now, after the rectification campaign of the past six months, especially after the Party Central Committee proposed to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important products in fifteen years or a little more, revised and promulgated the draft National Agricultural Development Program, and once again emphasized adhering to the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results, the revolutionary vigor of the people across the country has been further boosted. The situation in the past few months shows that many things that many people previously thought could not be done have been accomplished by the masses in a short period of time. Many things that seemed impossible in the past have now become possible. Our nation is "full of hope," not "somewhat hopeful," not "slightly hopeful," and certainly not hopeless, but truly and substantially full of hope. All pessimism is unfounded. Our nation has awakened and is greatly promoting vigorous revolutionary spirit, has done and will do even greater unprecedented things.
　　In this beautiful and vibrant time, there are also some worriers who are concerned that running so fast will cause "problems." They are said to have had "experience": anti-conservatism at the beginning of the year and anti-"rash advance" in the middle of the year is a rule. Their conclusion is, "In any case, be steady and reliable, and don't make the mistake of rash advance again." Many people did not say this, but in reality, they think so. They are complacent about the backward situation, neither analyzing and studying the changing actual situation, looking for ways to tap potential, nor mobilizing the masses to mobilize all positive factors. Their eyes are only focused on the difficulties of things, never opening their minds to find favorable conditions to overcome difficulties. They see no revolutionary vigor. "Let the wind and waves rise, sit steadily in the fishing boat" has become the philosophy of these comrades. It is not difficult to see that a right-leaning conservative thought still entangles the minds of these comrades.
　　These people do not understand: the leap forward and the rash advance have a fundamental difference. A leap forward is an advance with actual possibility. It is different from a normal advance. It is, under favorable revolutionary circumstances and in the high tide of the mass movement, doing everything possible to break conventions, adopt new methods or new technologies, and advance in big strides at a much faster pace than usual. Anhui Province completed 1.6 billion cubic meters of earthwork in water conservancy projects last winter and this spring (only 1.4 billion cubic meters were built in the past eight years), and Guangxi Province will build water conservancy irrigation area of 11.1 million mu this winter and spring (only 8.3 million mu in the past), which has more than doubled. This is a leap forward. This revolutionary leap forward embodies the scale of revolution and the speed of revolution, which is necessary for the entire socialist construction and necessary for the interests of the Party and the people. As long as the objective conditions are available, a leap forward can be achieved through subjective effort, and this leap forward is reliable. A plan that can be achieved without any effort cannot be called a reliable plan, but only a conservative plan. If the objective conditions are available, a leap forward can be achieved through effort, and not making a leap forward is right-leaning conservatism. Contrary to the leap forward, rash advance is a fantasy that exceeds the objective reality, without basis or without sufficient basis, and is subjective and reckless. The result is that it cannot be good and economical, nor can it be more and faster. It will not only fail to accelerate socialist construction, but also delay socialist construction. This is certainly not what we need, and it is what we oppose. However, many things that are clearly leap forwards are opposed by some people as "rash advances." A leap forward is jumping from an old stage to a new stage. Since it is something new, it will naturally not be perfect, will not be foolproof, and will have some shortcomings and faults, but this is by no means a "rash advance." The great development of various undertakings in our country in 1956, despite some individual shortcomings, is still a basically healthy great leap forward. The correct attitude should be to affirm the leap forward, affirm the good things, and at the same time take appropriate measures to adjust and overcome the individual shortcomings. However, some people cannot distinguish the difference between nine good fingers and one bad finger, regard the individual as the general, regard the tributary as the mainstream, make a wrong estimate of the overall situation, and nominally oppose "rash advance" but actually oppose leap forward. Learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, we should no longer use this wrong attitude to treat the current new leap forward.
　　There are many such people who are satisfied with a little achievement they have made, and satisfied with plans and indicators that are slightly higher than in the past. In their view, the achievements already made, the increased plans and indicators, are already almost enough, and it is already a step forward compared to the past, and can even be said to be a "miracle." These comrades only see the past, and only look at today's things based on old experiences and old rules, without thinking that the liberated productive forces and the awakened masses can create unprecedented miracles that no one dared to think of in the past. They also see some advanced examples, but they only feel that these are special and cannot be generally achieved. They do not ask themselves why others can do what they cannot, why what can be done in this place cannot be done in that place. They always emphasize difficulties, overestimate the factors of difficulties, underestimate the factors of overcoming difficulties, and lack the revolutionary optimism of turning negative factors into positive factors. Therefore, they do not learn from the advanced, and do not comprehensively promote advanced experience. They also have comparisons, but not with the most advanced, but with the backward, "better than those below, but not as good as those above," so they feel at ease. These comrades should understand that for us communists and all revolutionary patriots, doing things according to ordinary specifications is only the minimum requirement, and doing everything possible to do things more, faster, better, and more economically is our true nature. We should make the greatest efforts to do what we can achieve through effort. It is the revolutionary attitude that our communists should have when carrying out all undertakings to dare to break the "conventions" that hinder advanced things and strive for the top.
　　It must be understood that our cause is a revolutionary cause, and revolution - this is a leap forward. We are proletarian revolutionaries, not reformists. The proletariat is a class that has nothing. It either advances and achieves great epoch-making victories, or is content with the poverty, backwardness, and shackles of slavery imposed on us by the exploiting classes. In the past years of revolutionary struggle, we strived for the top, leaped forward, and overthrew all the exploiting systems that were pressing on the proletariat. Now, when the proletariat has seized power and is carrying out socialist construction, it equally needs to strive for the top and leap forward. Lenin once said on the eve of the October Revolution, "The revolution has made our political system catch up with advanced countries in a few months. But this is not enough. The war is extremely tenacious, and it raises such a stern question: either perish, or catch up with them in the economy as well.... Either perish, or advance at full speed. This is the question raised by history." After the October Revolution, the Soviet Communist Party, based on Lenin's instruction, implemented industrialization at a very high speed, making the Soviet Union catch up with developed capitalist countries in the economy. The environment in which our country is currently carrying out socialist construction is of course much better than the situation in the Soviet Union at that time. It is no longer like the Soviet Union at that time, carrying out socialist construction in a single country, but has the support of countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. However, the international environment in which our country is located still has imperialism eyeing us covetously, and the aggressive bloc headed by the United States hopes to subvert our People's Republic at all times. If we do not build at the fastest speed and strive to catch up with developed capitalist countries in the economy in the shortest possible time, the security of our country cannot be considered fully guaranteed. At the same time, from the domestic situation, our country was originally a large country that was "poor and blank" (economically very poor and culturally backward to the point of being almost blank). The material foundation of the socialist system is weak. If we do not quickly change this backward state, and strive to enable our country to have modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science in a relatively short period of time, and improve the people's material and cultural living standards, the material foundation of our country's socialist system cannot be considered consolidated. It is for this reason that the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results, put forward the draft National Agricultural Development Program, and put forward the goal of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more. As the saying goes: "Sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat." Our entire Party and the people of the whole country must summon revolutionary vigor and strive for the top, otherwise we will fall behind. In terms of realizing the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft), Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces have proposed to reach the targets stipulated in the program for ten years in five years or a little more. These are all leap forward plans to strive for the top. All provinces in the country should consider achieving the targets stipulated in the program for ten years in five, or six, or seven, or eight years. Ten years are determined by three years, and most of the country should strive to fundamentally change the face of the region in three years. Our slogan is to fight hard for three years, and the method is to boldly mobilize the masses and experiment with everything.
　　Of course, our cause is an arduous cause. To build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science is an unprecedented feat. To accomplish such a feat, there will be no lack of difficulties. The question is what attitude we take towards difficulties. For us communists, difficulties are part of the equation. Because we are doing a world-shaking undertaking. It is inconceivable to do such an undertaking without difficulties. Revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism are the qualities that communists should have. Without revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism, it is impossible to persevere in the revolutionary struggle, let alone achieve revolutionary victory. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us to despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically. That is to say, for the enemy and difficulties, we must first despise them, we must have the determination and confidence to overcome them, and then deal with each specific enemy and difficulty seriously and gradually overcome them. Communists must have the heroic spirit and revolutionary vigor to overcome all enemies and difficulties, be vigorous, lively, have active minds, be good at accepting new things, be full of enterprising spirit, dare to break "conventions," and forge ahead bravely. Our country is poor and blank, which is certainly a difficulty in the process of our socialist construction, but at the same time it is also a favorable condition for us to build socialism. Precisely because our country is poor and blank, our people are particularly eager for revolution, eager to change the backward economic and cultural conditions of our country, eager to build a prosperous, strong, and happy life, and the 600 million people who have such strong socialist enthusiasm are brave and hardworking, and are an inexhaustible force. In front of this great force, high mountains must bow their heads, and rivers must give way.
　　Let all our Party comrades and all revolutionary patriots, together with the masses of the people, summon revolutionary vigor, break all right-leaning conservative thoughts, strive for the top, and carry out socialist construction with more, faster, better, and more economical results!

### 鼓起干劲，力争上游！

　　鼓起干劲，力争上游！
    打开最近各地的报纸，真个叫人心花怒放。跃进的消息一个接着一个，革命的干劲洋溢在字里行间。农村中每天有近一亿人向自然大进军，热火朝天地进行水利建设；城市中千百万厂矿企业的职工，正在敲响挖掘潜力的锣鼓，一而再、再而三地突破原订的计划指标。所有这些振奋人心的好消息，都预示着：1958年——第二个五年计划的头一年，我国人民在各个战线上都要打一个大胜仗。
    目前在我们的国家到处呈现的这种蓬勃、兴旺的气象，显示了我国社会主义革命不但在所有制方面，而且在思想战线和政治战线方面获得了伟大胜利以后，我国人民革命干劲的新高涨。我国人民赶走了帝国主义，打倒了官僚资本主义和封建主义，完成了对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，这些都是我国人民革命斗争的辉煌成就。现在经过了去年大半年的整风运动，特别是党中央提出在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，修正公布全国农业发展纲要草案，以及又一次强调坚持又多又快又好又省的勤俭建国的方针之后，全国人民的革命干劲更加高涨起来了。过去几个月的情况表明，从前许多人认为做不到的一些事情，群众却在不长的时间内办到了。从前看来不可能的许多事情，现在都成为可能的了。我们的民族是“大有希望”的，不是“中有希望”，也不是“小有希望”，更不是没有希望，而是实实在在地大有希望。一切悲观论是毫无根据的。我们民族已经觉醒起来，正在大大发扬旺盛的革命精神，已经做了并且还要做出更加伟大的前无古人的事情。
    在这春色满园、气象万千的大好时光里，也不是没有一些工愁善虑的人担心跑得这样快，会不会出“乱子”？据说他们有过“经验”：年初反保守、年中反“冒进”是一个规律。他们的结论是，“无论如何要稳妥可靠些，不要再犯冒进的错误。”许多人虽没有这样说，但实际上是这么想。他们对于落后的状况安之若素，既不去分析研究变化中的实际情况，寻找挖潜力的途径，也不去发动群众，调动一切积极因素。他们的目光只注定在事情的困难方面，从不打开脑筋，找出战胜困难的有利条件。在他们那里看不见什么革命的干劲。“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船”，成为这些同志的处世哲学。不难看到，一种右倾保守的思想还缠绕着这些同志的脑筋。
    这些人不了解：跃进和冒进有原则的不同。跃进是一种有实际可能性的前进，它不同于通常的前进，它是在有利的革命形势下，在群众运动的高潮中，千方百计，打破常规，采取新的方法或者新的技术，以比通常快得多的速度，迈大步的前进。安徽省去冬今春已完成水利工程十六亿土方（过去八年中只修了十四亿多土方），广西省去冬今春将修水利灌溉面积一千一百万亩（过去共只有八百三十万亩），都翻了一翻以上，这就是跃进。这种革命式的跃进，体现出革命的规模和革命的速度，是为整个社会主义建设所必需，为党和人民的利益所必需的。只要客观条件具备，经过主观努力可以跃进，这种跃进就是可靠的。不经过什么努力就可以达到的计划，决不能称为可靠的计划，只能叫做保守的计划。如果客观条件具备，经过努力可以跃进，不跃进就是右倾保守。同跃进相反，冒进是超越了客观实际的可能，没有根据或者没有充分根据的胡思乱想，主观主义的蛮干。其结果是既不能好省，也不能多快，不仅不能加速社会主义建设，而且会延缓社会主义建设。这当然不是我们所需要的，而且是我们所反对的。但是，有许多事情，明明是跃进，却被有些人当作“冒进”来反对。跃进是从旧的阶段跳到新的阶段，既然是新的东西，自然不会十全十美，不会万无一失，会有一些这样或者那样的缺点和过失，但这决不是“冒进”。1956年我国各项事业的大发展，尽管其中有个别的缺点，但仍然是一个基本上健康的大跃进。正确的态度应当是肯定跃进，肯定好的东西，同时采取适当的方式来调整和克服其中个别的缺点。但是有些人却分辨不出九个好指头和一个坏指头的区别，把个别当作一般，把支流当作主流，对整个形势作出了错误的估计，名为反“冒进”，实际反跃进。惩前毖后，我们不应当再用这种错误的态度来对待当前的新的跃进。
    有很多这样的人，他们满足于已得的一点成绩，满足于比过去稍为提高的计划和指标。在他们看来，已得的成绩，提高了的计划和指标，已经差不多了，比起过去来说已经是进了一步，甚至可以说是“奇迹”了。这些同志只看到过去，只会根据老经验、老规矩来看今天的事情，没有想到解放了的生产力，觉醒了的群众可以干出前无古人的、过去谁也不敢想的奇迹来。他们也看到某些先进的范例，但是他们只觉得这是特殊的、不能普遍做到的事情。他们没有反问自己，为什么别人能做到的事情自己不能做到，为什么这个地方做到的事情那个地方做不到。他们总是强调困难，把困难的因素估计得过多，把战胜困难的因素估计得过少，更缺乏把消极因素变为积极因素的革命乐观主义。因此他们不是向先进看齐，不是把先进经验全面推广。他们也有比较，但不是和最先进的比，而是和落后的比，“比上不足，比下有余”，这样他们也就心安理得了。这些同志应该了解，对于我们共产党人和一切革命志士来说，把事情做得合乎普通规格只是最起码的要求，而尽一切可能把事情做得更多更快更好更省才是我们的本色。经过努力本来可以做到的事情，我们应该尽最大的努力去做。勇于打破妨碍先进事物的“常规”，力争上游，是我们共产主义者在进行一切事业的时候应有的革命态度。
    必须了解，我们的事业是革命的事业，而革命——这就是跃进。我们是无产阶级的革命者而不是改良主义者。无产阶级是一无所有的阶级，它或者前进而取得伟大的划时代的胜利，或者安于剥削阶级加给我们的贫穷、落后和奴隶的锁链。在过去革命斗争的年代里，我们就是力争上游，向前跃进，把压在无产阶级身上的一切剥削制度统统推翻。现在，当无产阶级已经掌握了政权，进行社会主义建设的时候，同样地需要力争上游，向前跃进。列宁在十月革命前夕曾经说过，“革命在几个月中使我们的政治制度赶上了先进的国家。但是，这还不够。战争是极顽强的，它很严厉地提出了这样的问题：或者是灭亡，或者是同样地在经济上也赶过它们。……或者是灭亡，或者是开足马力向前进展。这是历史提出来的问题。”十月革命后，苏联共产党就是根据列宁的这个原则指示，以很高的速度实行工业化，使苏联在经济上赶上发达的资本主义国家。目前我国进行社会主义建设所处的环境当然比苏联当时的情况好得多，已经不像苏联当时那样单独一国进行社会主义建设，而是有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的支援了。但是，我国所处的国际环境，仍然有帝国主义虎视眈眈，以美国为首的侵略集团无时不希望颠复我们的人民共和国，如果我们不以最快的速度进行建设，不力争在尽可能短的时间内在经济上赶上发达的资本主义国家，我国的安全就不能认为有充分的保证。同时，从国内情况来说，我国原来是一个“又穷又白”（在经济上还很贫困，在文化上许多方面还落后到接近空白的程度）的大国，社会主义制度的物质基础是薄弱的，如果我们不迅速改变这种落后状态，不力争在比较短的时间内使我国拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代文化科学，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活水平，我国社会主义制度的物质基础就不能认为是巩固的。正是因为这个缘故，党中央提出了多快好省的勤俭建国的方针，提出了全国农业发展纲要草案，提出了在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的奋斗目标。古语说：“逆水行舟，不进则退。”我们全党和全国人民，必须鼓起革命干劲，力争上游，否则我们就要落后。就实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）来说，浙江、广东、江苏、山东、安徽、江西等省已经提出五年或者稍多一点的时间内粮食生产达到纲要规定要十年达到的指标。这些都是力争上游的大跃进的计划。全国各省都应当考虑在五年、或者六年、或者七年、或者八年内实现纲要所规定的十年实现的指标。十年决于三年，全国大部分应争取在三年内使当地区的面貌基本改变。我们的口号是苦战三年，方法是放手发动群众，一切经过试验。
    当然，我们的事业是艰巨的事业。要把我国建设成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代文化科学的社会主义强国，是前无古人的壮举。要完成这样的壮举，不会没有困难。问题在于我们对困难采取什么态度。对于我们共产党人来说，困难是题中应有之议。因为我们干的是翻天复地的事业。干这样的事业而没有困难是不可设想的。革命的乐观主义和革命的英雄主义是共产党人应有的气质。没有革命的乐观主义和革命的英雄主义，就决不可能坚持革命的斗争，更不用说取得革命的胜利了。毛泽东同志经常教导我们，要在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。就是说，对于敌人、困难，首先必须藐视它，必须有战胜它的决心和信心，然后认真地对付每个具体的敌人、困难，逐步地把它战胜。共产党人必须有战胜一切敌人和困难的英雄气概和革命干劲，朝气蓬勃，生龙活虎，思想活泼，善于接受新鲜事物，富于进取精神，敢于打破“常规”，奋勇前进。我国又穷又白，固然是我们社会主义建设过程中的困难，但同时又是我们建设社会主义的有利条件。正因为我国又穷又白，我国人民特别迫切要求革命，要求改变我国经济上和文化上的落后状况，要求建设繁荣、富强、幸福的生活，而具有这样强烈的社会主义的积极性的六亿人民，勇敢勤劳，正是一股无穷无尽的力量，在这股伟大的力量面前，高山也要低头，河水也要让路。
    让我们全党同志和所有革命志士，同人民群众一起，鼓起革命干劲，打破一切右倾保守思想，力争上游，又多又快又好又省地进行社会主义建设吧！
