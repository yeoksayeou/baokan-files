　　Vietnamese Democratic Republic President Ho Chi Minh recently paid a ten-day friendly visit to India and issued a joint statement with Indian Prime Minister Nehru. During his visit to India, President Ho Chi Minh received a warm welcome from Indian government leaders and people from all over the country. In the Indian capital, Delhi, hundreds of thousands of citizens lined the streets shouting "Long live Ho Chi Minh and Vietnam!" This fully demonstrates the Indian people's deep friendship for the Vietnamese people.
　　Both the Vietnamese and Indian people have long suffered from imperialist enslavement and oppression. Since the establishment of the Republic of India and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, they have been fighting to safeguard their independence and freedom and consolidate world peace. Therefore, there has never been any conflict or hostility between the Vietnamese and Indian people, and they have always respected and supported each other. Today, thanks to President Ho Chi Minh's visit to India, this precious friendship between the Vietnamese and Indian people has been further deepened.
　　The issue of Vietnam's peaceful reunification is one of the issues that peace-loving people in Asian countries are most concerned about. At a press conference held at the Presidential Palace in India on February 7, President Ho Chi Minh said on this issue: "Our position is very clear and unchangeable, that is: to reunify Vietnam peacefully on the basis of independence and democracy in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. We are ready to consult with the South Vietnamese authorities to discuss holding free national elections to reunify our country." This once again demonstrates the sincerity and efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to strive for the reunification of North and South Vietnam. Since the signing of the Geneva Accords three and a half years ago, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not only conscientiously implemented the various provisions of the agreement, but has also been actively creating conditions for the reunification of Vietnam. Since July 1955, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly suggested to the South Vietnamese authorities to convene a political consultation conference in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, in order to jointly discuss the reunification of Vietnam. However, due to the obstruction and sabotage of the United States and its agent, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, these proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have not been realized, and Vietnam is still in a state of division. At the same time, the United States openly violated the Geneva Accords, attempting to turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base, and conspired to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc in order to threaten the peace of Indochina and Asia. This situation is intolerable to the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving Asian people.
　　The Indian government and people have always sympathized with the Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification of their motherland. President Prasad said at a banquet welcoming President Ho Chi Minh: "We hope that the current situation will be transformed into a unified Vietnam built through peaceful means and based on democratic principles." The Indian government and people contributed to the success of the Geneva Conference. After the signing of the Geneva Accords, India served as the chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, playing a positive role in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. Now, President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Nehru have once again expressed in a joint statement their hope that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam will continue its efforts to maintain and consolidate peace in Vietnam on the basis of implementing the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, and to restore the unity of Vietnam through free national elections held under the supervision of an international commission. The leaders of Vietnam and India also pointed out that it is necessary to promote mutual understanding between the two regions of Vietnam in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Geneva Accords. All of these are strong support for the Vietnamese people's struggle for peaceful reunification of their motherland and are completely in line with the peaceful interests of Indochina.
　　Both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and India are countries that actively implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the joint statement, President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Nehru reaffirmed their confidence in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and believed that applying these principles in international relations would help ease international tensions. They condemned "colonialism and the act of foreign coercive occupation or control of the territory of other countries" and expressed deep sympathy for the people of all countries fighting for their independence and sovereignty.
　　The leaders of Vietnam and India discussed the entire international situation with great concern. They unanimously agreed in the joint statement that holding a high-level meeting to consider the cessation of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons tests as a way to gradually achieve disarmament and ease world tensions is entirely appropriate. Obviously, these propositions are a concrete manifestation of the peaceful policies consistently pursued by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and India. It not only reflects the peaceful aspirations of the people of Vietnam and India, but also reflects the universal demand of the people of the world to strive for further easing of international tensions. Recently, Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly put forward peaceful proposals regarding holding high-level meetings, stopping nuclear weapons tests, and opposing the establishment of rocket bases in Europe and Asia, which have been valued by Asian and world public opinion. We believe that in the current situation of surging tides of peace, the many peaceful propositions put forward by President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Nehru in this joint statement will surely have a positive impact on peace in Asia and the world.
　　President Ho Chi Minh said well during his visit to India: "Striving for peace, cooperation, and friendship—this is the spring of mankind." Yes, let the people of our Asian countries, together with the people of all countries in the world, strive together for a beautiful spring for mankind!

### 共同的意志和愿望

    共同的意志和愿望
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席最近到印度作了为期十天的友好访问，并同印度总理尼赫鲁发表了联合声明。胡志明主席在访问印度期间，受到了印度政府领导人和各地人民的热情欢迎。在印度首都德里，成千成万的市民夹道高呼“胡志明和越南万岁”。这充分表现了印度人民对越南人民的亲切友谊。
    越南和印度两国人民过去都长期遭受帝国主义的奴役和压迫。在印度共和国和越南民主共和国成立以后，他们都在为维护自己的独立自由和巩固世界和平而斗争。因此，在越南人民和印度人民之间从来没有任何冲突和敌对，他们始终是互相尊重和互相支持的。今天，由于胡志明主席到印度的访问，越南和印度两国人民之间的这种珍贵的友谊是更进一步地加深了。
    越南的和平统一问题，是亚洲各国爱好和平人民所最关心的问题之一。胡志明主席2月7日在印度总统府举行的记者招待会上曾就这个问题发表谈话说：“我们的立场是非常明确的、不可更改的，这就是：按照日内瓦协议的规定，通过和平方法在独立和民主的基础上重新统一越南。我们已经准备同南越当局进行协商，讨论举行全国自由普选以重新统一我国的问题。”这又一次表现了越南民主共和国争取越南南北统一的诚意和努力。自从日内瓦协议签订后三年半以来，越南民主共和国不仅认真地执行了协议的各项规定，而且一直在设法为越南的重新统一而积极创造条件。从1955年7月以来，越南民主共和国曾根据日内瓦协议的规定，一再向南越当局建议召开政治协商会议，以便共同商讨越南重新统一的问题。但是，由于美国和它的代理人吴庭艳集团的一味阻挠和破坏，越南民主共和国的这些建议都没有实现，越南至今仍处于分裂状态。同时，美国公开破坏日内瓦协议，力图把南越变成它的殖民地和军事基地，并且阴谋把南越拉入东南亚侵略集团，以威胁印度支那和亚洲的和平。这种情况是越南人民和一切爱好和平的亚洲人民所不能容忍的。
    印度政府和人民一贯同情越南人民争取祖国和平统一的愿望。普拉沙德总统在欢迎胡志明主席的宴会上说：“我们希望目前的局面将会转变为通过和平方法和根据民主原则建成的统一的越南。”印度政府和人民曾经对日内瓦会议的成功作过贡献。在日内瓦协议签订以后，印度又担任了越南国际监督和监察委员会主席，对日内瓦协议在越南的实施起了积极的作用。现在，胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理在联合声明中再次表示希望越南国际监督和监察委员会今后仍将进行努力，以期在履行关于越南的日内瓦协议的基础上，维护和巩固越南的和平，并通过在一个国际委员会的监督下举行的越南全国性的自由选举，来恢复越南的统一。越南和印度两国领导人并且指出，有必要按照日内瓦协议的原则和规定，来促进越南两个地区之间的互相了解。所有这些都是对于越南人民争取祖国和平统一斗争的有力支持，并且是完全符合印度支那的和平利益的。
    越南民主共和国和印度都是积极执行和平共处五项原则的国家。胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理在联合声明中重申了他们对和平共处五项原则的信心，并认为在国际关系中应用这些原则，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势。他们谴责了“殖民主义和外国强制占领或者控制其他国家领土的行为”，而对于为自身的独立和主权而斗争的各国人民表示深切同情。
    越南和印度两国领导人以十分关切的心情讨论了整个国际局势问题。他们在联合声明中一致认为，举行高级会议来考虑停止核武器和热核武器的试验，作为逐步实现裁军和缓和世界紧张局势的途径，是完全适当的。显然，这些主张也就是越南民主共和国和印度两国所一贯执行的和平政策的具体表现。它不仅反映了越南和印度两国人民的和平愿望，而且反映了全世界人民争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势的普遍要求。最近，尼赫鲁总理一再提出关于举行高级会议、停止核武器试验和反对在欧洲和亚洲建立火箭基地等和平建议，就曾经受到亚洲和世界舆论的重视。我们相信，在目前和平潮流汹涌澎湃的形势下，胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理在这次联合声明中所提出的许多和平主张，一定会对亚洲和世界和平发生积极的影响。
    胡志明主席在访问印度的时候说得好：“为和平、合作、友谊而奋斗——这是人类的春天。”是的，让我们亚洲各国人民，同世界各国人民一起，为争取人类的美好春天而共同奋斗吧！
