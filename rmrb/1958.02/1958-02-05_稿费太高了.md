    Manuscript Fees Are Too High
    The manuscript fees of the People's Daily seem rather high. For example, your newspaper published a short article I wrote in the "Letters to the Editor" column last year. The entire article was only about 250 characters, but I received ten yuan in manuscript fees. Other newspapers are similar. For instance, a classmate of mine published a report in the Guangming Daily criticizing some shortcomings in our college's internship program. The entire article was only 400 characters, yet he received twenty-seven yuan in manuscript fees. It is said that manuscript fees for other articles are even higher. Many of us believe that such high manuscript fees are unreasonable because: (1) They do not follow the principle of "payment according to labor." The payment far exceeds the author's labor and its value. (2) It has a negative impact. Many people think that being a writer is very comfortable and that one can gain "both fame and fortune." More seriously, some people are even becoming obsessed with writing articles for profit. Although these thoughts and actions are personal ideological problems, such high manuscript fees cannot be said to have no stimulating effect on them.
    Now that the whole country is in the midst of a rectification upsurge, I would like to offer a suggestion to your newspaper and other publications: please consider lowering manuscript fees.

### 稿费太高了

    稿费太高了
    人民日报的稿酬似乎偏高。例如你报去年在读者来信栏登载了我写的一篇短文，全文不过二百五十字，却给了我十元的稿费。另外有些报纸也是如此。如我校一位同学曾在光明日报发表了一篇批评我院实习中的一些缺点的报道，全文只有四百字，竟得到了二十七元的稿酬，据说其他文章的稿酬还要高呢。我们很多人都认为这么高的稿酬是不合理的，因为：（一）这没有依照“按劳付酬”的原则。付酬远远地超过了作者的劳动量与劳动价值；（二）影响不好。许多人认为当作家很舒服，可以“名利双收”。更严重的是有些人竟因此而沉醉于写文章取利。虽然他们这些想法和做法是本人的思想毛病，但这样高的稿酬不能不说是对他们起了刺激作用啊。
    现在全国正处在整改的高潮中，谨向你报和其他报刊进一言，请考虑降低稿酬。　　　　　华南师范学院　张志能
