Xinhua News Agency, 15th: After more than eight months of rectification campaigns in national universities, especially after the magnificent mass rectification climax, a new atmosphere of "Three Diligences" and "Three Delegations" has emerged.

The so-called "Three Diligences" are diligence and thrift in running schools, diligence and thrift in production, and diligence and work-study programs. Many schools have proactively examined the past ideas of pursuing quantity, scale, and novelty, which were not in line with diligence and thrift in running schools. The situation of schools vying for funding and construction area from the competent departments has decreased. Some teachers in the Political Teaching and Research Office of Sichuan University even conducted a specific survey of the area and use of teaching rooms on campus, proposing rational arrangement opinions, believing that even if more students were added, it would not be necessary to build a new physics and chemistry teaching building with a budget of 500,000 yuan. The facts revealed by teachers and students in various schools, due to school and department localism, schools comparing with each other, and pursuing international standards, which resulted in a large amount of backlog and waste in teaching instruments and equipment, have been dealt with through rectification, and necessary systems have also been established in laboratories. Class A of the second grade of the Water Supply and Drainage Department of the Civil Engineering Department of Tianjin University proposed to the whole school to launch a "Three Savings (saving water, electricity, and food), Three Loves (loving books, instruments, and equipment), Three Comparisons (comparing labor, comparing hardship, comparing simplicity)" movement. Their slogan is: "Don't be extravagant and wasteful bourgeois young masters and young ladies, but be diligent and simple-minded intellectuals of the working class." Many schools have also reviewed and reduced the equipment purchase plans for 1958. The Chengdu Institute of Physical Education originally planned to purchase 120 basketballs and 120 volleyballs in the 1958 budget. After mass debate and detailed calculation, it was decided not to buy any basketballs and only buy a few volleyballs. The school's purchase costs can be reduced by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Things that were previously considered difficult to do have been achieved. Recently, all 2,000 teachers and students of Northwest Institute of Technology moved from Xianyang to Xi'an by themselves, without hiring a single temporary worker or buying a single piece of wood or a box. In addition to helping move public property, students also helped teachers move their homes, saving the country nearly 10,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the food expenses of 1,000 students for a month.

During the rectification campaign, some examples of Northwest Russian Language School maintaining the tradition of diligence and thrift in running schools in the old liberated areas were valued by universities in the Northwest region. Since liberation, many schools have added new cars, but this school only spent 1,000 yuan to buy an old car, which has been used for three years after repair and can still be used. Greening the campus and building roads have become regular after-school activities for teachers and students. According to statistics for 1956 and 1957: the school cultivated more than 14,000 tree seedlings, and more than 10,000 catties of tree branches cut for firewood; built 1,867 square meters of roads; after the school reclaimed and planted land, it harvested 8,313 catties of wheat and 315,000 catties of various vegetables. In addition, the school also raised 184 pigs, so that each student could eat an average of four to five catties of pork per month. Since 1955, the school has "married" with the nearby agricultural production cooperatives. Teachers and students help the agricultural cooperatives with summer planting and autumn harvesting, and water conservancy construction in their spare time. In the summer of 1957, due to poor food management and extravagance, Northwest University overspent more than 8,000 yuan by September. The school leaders mobilized all students to raise pigs and grow vegetables to compensate for the deficit with their own labor. The school's labor education has also laid a foundation since then.

Now, the issue of transforming school practice factories, laboratories, and farms into production units has attracted the attention of various schools. Many laboratories of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics have become new-type factories for training red aviation engineers. Many precision instruments jointly produced by teachers and staff in the instrument workshop have approached international standards. In the practice workshop, lower-grade students combined practice assignments to make many exquisite hand-cranked bench drills, iron forks, etc., and the variable speed gears and piston pins trial-produced by higher-grade students are of good quality. Twenty-seven students majoring in electronics in the fourth grade of the Physics Department of Fudan University decided to save the country 30,000 yuan by repairing and assembling instruments within half a year. The Central China Agricultural College will arrange students to plant experimental fields in the teaching plans of each grade. The already arranged third-year students will plant 20-30 mu of experimental fields per class according to the different nature of the majors. The experimental fields will be managed by each class contracting land, contracting output, contracting investment, and managing by dividing pits and zones. Some schools also have student-organized sewing societies, barbershops, etc., which are all sprouts of various forms of work-study programs in schools.

Students have been educated in the rectification campaign, criticizing the past unreasonable phenomena of clamoring "the scholarship standard is too low," "the scope of enjoyment is too narrow," and demanding that scholarships be paid during winter and summer vacations. Many students have proposed to lower the standard of food expenses, and some students have requested to solve their living difficulties through work-study activities, applying to reduce subsidies or cancel subsidies. Fifteen universities in Jiangsu Province have changed the general student people's scholarship method, which can save the country more than 1.1 million yuan each year. Since January, more than 1,000 students from Nanjing Normal College have voluntarily saved one yuan per month in food expenses per person. For some working-class and peasant students who have difficulties but have not yet applied for subsidies from the state or whose subsidies are too low, the leaders of various universities in Jiangsu have taken the initiative to take care of them to ensure that the working-class and peasant students can study with peace of mind.

The so-called "Three Delegations" are going to the countryside and mountains, delegating to classes, departments, and participating in street, cooperative, and factory work. These are three aspects of activities after the transformation of the work style of school administrative leaders and teachers. Many schools have actively responded to the Party's call for cadres to be delegated, and going to the countryside and mountains has become the most glorious thing. More than 80% of the teachers of the Southwest Agricultural College have signed up to request to go to labor training. The Mechanics Teaching and Research Office of Beijing Railway College originally had sixteen people, responsible for the teaching tasks of fourteen classes, and also requested to add a few more people. After the school handed over the issue of streamlining the organization and delegating cadres to the masses for discussion, now this teaching and research office has not only not increased people, but also delegated six people under the condition that the teaching task has increased to twenty-five classes. Because the masses have mustered revolutionary energy, the current proportion of faculty and staff delegated by general schools has reached 30%. Administrative leaders and teachers of Nanjing universities have been delegated at all levels, strengthening departments and going deep into classes. According to the requirements put forward by students in the rectification campaign, Northwest University decided to let Provost Guo Shengwu "delegate" to teach history courses in the History Department, and Deputy Provost Mei Yiqin to teach the history of drama. Many political course teachers in various schools have put forward "Five Same" with students - eating, living, studying, laboring, and entertaining together. The situation of teachers from various schools going to laboratories and going deep into students is even more common.

More than 400 teachers and staff of Central China Agricultural College have personally planted more than 130 mu of experimental fields. In order to break the past practice of universities conducting experiments behind closed doors, the school decided to regard planting experimental fields as an experimental research project that all teachers must do. At the same time, the school also mobilized teachers and some students to investigate and summarize the masses' production experience and production situation. On this basis, the school will then conduct some necessary and reliable high-level experimental research projects by teachers according to the principle of fewer but better. In order to better connect with the actual situation of the province, Southwest Agricultural College put forward three methods: production internships should not go out of the "provincial gate"; further studies should go to agricultural production cooperatives; and scientific research should first start from solving problems in production.

    全国高等学校整改后
    进行“三勤”“三放”到处气象一新
    新华社15日讯　全国高等学校经过八个多月的整风运动，特别是经过波澜壮阔的群众性的整改高潮以后，出现了“三勤”、“三放”的新气象。
    所谓“三勤”是勤俭办学，勤俭生产和勤工俭学。很多学校主动地检查了过去不符合勤俭办学，求多、求大、求新的思想。学校向主管部门争经费，争基建面积的情况减少了。四川大学政治教研室一些教员还具体调查了校内教学用房的面积和使用情况，提出合理安排的意见，认为即使再增加学生也不必新建预算达五十万元的理化教学大楼。各校师生揭发出来的由于学校、系科的本位主义，学校与学校之间互相比，追求国际水平等思想，而在教学仪器设备方面造成的大量积压和浪费的事实，通过整改已经进行处理，实验室还建立了必要的制度。天津大学土木系给水排水专业二年级甲班学生向全校倡议开展“三节（节约水电粮食），三爱（爱图书、仪器、设备），三比（比劳动、比艰苦、比朴素）”运动，他们的口号是：“不做奢侈浪费的资产阶级少爷小姐，要做一个勤俭朴素的工人阶级知识分子”。很多学校还对1958年购置设备的计划进行审查核减。成都体育学院1958年预算上原拟购篮球一百二十个，排球一百二十个，经过群众辩论后，算了细账，篮球一个都不买、排球只买几个就可以了。全校购置费可以减少五、六万元。过去被认为难于做到的事情做到了。西北工业大学全校二千人，最近从咸阳迁去西安，全部由师生员工自己动手，没有雇一个临时工，没有买一块木板，一只箱子；学生除了帮助搬公物外，还帮助教师搬家，为国家节省开支近万元，约相当于一千个学生一个月的伙食费。
    整风中，西北俄语专科学校一贯保持老解放区勤俭办学传统的一些事例，受到西北地区高等学校的重视。解放几年来，很多学校都添置了新汽车，这个学校只花了一千元买了一辆旧车，修理以后已经用了三年，还能用。绿化校园，修筑道路已成为师生们经常的课余活动。据1956、1957两年的统计：学校培育树苗一万四千多株，剪修下来的树枝供烤火用柴达一万多斤；修筑道路一千八百六十七平方公尺；学校在垦荒播种后，收获了麦子八千三百一十三斤，各种蔬菜三十一万五千斤，另外，学校还养猪一百八十四头，使每个学生平均每月可以吃到四、五斤猪肉。这个学校从1955年起就和附近的农业生产合作社“结了亲”，学校师生有空就帮助农业社去夏播秋收、兴修水利。西北大学在1957年夏季，因学生伙食管理不善，大手大脚，到9月份就超支八千多元，学校领导就发动全校学生养猪、种菜等，以自己的劳动补偿了这笔亏空。学校的劳动教育也从此打下了基础。
    现在，把学校的实习工厂、实验室、农场转变为生产单位的问题，已经引起了各校的重视。北京航空学院的许多实验室已经成为培养红色航空工程师的新型工厂。仪表车间的教师、职工共同制作的许多精密仪器，有的已经接近了国际水平。在实习车间，低年级学生结合实习作业制作出许多精致的手摇台钻、铁叉子等，高年级学生试制出来的变速齿轮和活塞梢等产品，质量都很好。复旦大学物理系四年级电子学专业27个学生决定在半年内通过修配仪器为国家节约三万元。华中农学院在各年级的教学计划中，将安排学生种实习田。已经安排就绪的三年级学生，根据不同性质的专业，每班种二十—三十亩实习田。实习田将采取由各班包地、包产、包投资和分坑、分区培育管理的办法来进行管理。有的学校还有学生组织的缝纫社、理发社等，都是学校中勤工俭学的各种形式的萌芽。
    学生们受到整风运动的教育，批判了过去叫嚷“助学金标准低了”，“享受面窄了”，要求寒、暑假照发助学金等不合理现象。很多学生提出要求降低伙食费的标准，有的学生要求通过勤工俭学的活动来解决生活困难，申请减少补助或取消补助。江苏省十五所高等院校改变了一般学生人民助学金的办法，每年可为国家节约一百一十多万元。南京师范学院的学生从1月份起，已有一千多名学生每人每月自动节省伙食费一元。对于一些有困难但尚未向国家申请补助或补助偏低的工农学生，江苏各高等学校领导上主动地予以照顾，保证工农学生能够安心学习。
    所谓“三放”是下乡上山，下放班、系和参加街道、合作社、工厂工作，这是目前学校行政领导和教师作风转变以后的三方面的活动。很多学校积极响应了党的干部下放的号召，下乡上山成了最光荣的事情。西南农学院教师报名要求去劳动锻炼的占80％以上。北京铁道学院力学教研室原来有十六个人，担任十四个班的教学任务，还要求增加几个人。学校把紧缩机构、下放干部的问题交给群众讨论后，现在这个教研室在教学任务增加到二十五个班的情况下，不仅不增加人，还下放了六人。由于群众鼓起了革命干劲，目前一般学校教职员下放的比例达到30％。南京各高等学校的行政领导和教师逐级下放，加强了科系，深入了班级。西北大学根据学生在整改中提出的要求，决定让教务长郭绳武“下放”担任历史系的课程，副教务长梅一芹担任戏剧史的教学。很多学校政治课教师提出了和学生“五同”，——同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同娱乐。各校教师下实验室，深入到学生中去的情况就更为普遍了。
    华中农学院全体教师职工四百多人，已经亲自动手种了一百三十多亩试验田。为了打破高等学校过去关门作试验的做法，学校并决定把种试验田当作全体教师人人必做的试验研究项目。同时学校还发动教师和部分学生去调查和总结群众生产经验和生产情况。在这基础上，学校再根据少而精的原则，由教师进行一些必要的有把握的高级的试验研究项目。西南农学院为了更好地联系本省的实际，提出三个办法：生产实习不出“省门”；进修到农业生产合作社；科学研究首先从解决生产中的问题着手。
