　　Let the East Wind Prevail Further Over the West Wind!
    The Course and Achievements of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
    Guo Moruo, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference
Comrades, friends:
    On December 14th of last year, representatives from all circles in our capital held a meeting here to support the convocation of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and bid farewell to our Chinese delegation attending the conference. Today, we are gathering here again to celebrate the significant achievements and victories of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, to report to you and to the people of the whole country on the conference's progress and achievements.
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, starting from December 26, 1957. After seven days of enthusiastic and harmonious discussions, it unanimously adopted a series of important resolutions and concluded victoriously on January 1st of this year. As Chairman Mao Zedong anticipated in his congratulatory telegram to the conference, this conference made a great contribution to carrying forward the Bandung Spirit, promoting the unity of the Asian-African people, striving for and safeguarding the national independence of Asia and Africa, and defending the great cause of peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. This historic contribution is worthy of celebration by the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving people around the world.
　　Showed the Great Strength of the Unity of the Asian-African People, Unfolded a New Stage of Great Unity of the Asian-African People
    Nearly fifty Asian and African countries and regions participated in this conference, with 508 representatives. Many Western countries, fraternal Eastern European countries, and international organizations sent observers to participate. It was the largest peaceful and united gathering of the Asian-African people since the Bandung Conference in 1955, unprecedented in the history of Asia and Africa. It powerfully expressed the common demands of the 1.7 billion Asian-African people living on approximately 77 million square kilometers of land in Asia and Africa for independence, freedom, and the maintenance of world peace. It also reflected the universal aspirations of peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world.
    The seven-day conference was conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere. According to the conference agenda, the conference listened to the reports made by relevant countries, namely, political reports (including the international situation, the issue of imperialism, the issue of colonialism, the issue of Algeria, the issue of racial discrimination, and the issue of nuclear weapons, etc.), economic reports, cultural reports, and social reports. In addition, the heads of various delegations also spoke at the conference. In addition to the plenary sessions, the conference also established five committees on political, economic, cultural, social, and organizational matters to discuss various related issues, and unanimously adopted the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference Declaration, the resolution on imperialism, the resolution on the United Nations, the resolution on disarmament and elimination of the threat of atomic war, the resolution on the Algerian issue, the resolution on the racial discrimination issue, the resolution on supporting the Palestinian issue, as well as resolutions on cultural issues, economic issues, social development issues, and organizational issues. It was also decided that March 2nd of this year would be designated as the day for banning nuclear weapons, and March 30th would be designated as the day for supporting Algeria. It should be especially pointed out here that the resolution on the United Nations explicitly stated: "China must be restored to its legitimate and rightful position in the United Nations." We thank the people of Asian and African countries for their support for our people. In order to implement these resolutions of the conference and promote the strengthening of the Asian-African solidarity movement, the conference has established a permanent body called the "Asian-African Solidarity Council," under which there is a permanent secretariat, headquartered in Cairo; the Secretary-General is from Egypt, and ten secretaries are from Cameroon, China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Sudan, Syria, and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Council also elected Egypt as Chairman of the Council, with Algeria, India, the Soviet Union, and Sudan serving as Vice-Chairmen.
    The representation of this conference was very broad. Among the representatives were speakers of parliament, government ministers, former prime ministers, leaders of various political parties, political activists, leaders from religious, scientific, and literary circles, and representatives from all walks of life. Although these representatives came from various different countries and regions, and their social systems, ideologies, languages, and customs were different, everyone at the conference had a common language, namely, opposition to imperialism and colonialism, and the demand for independence, equality, and peace. The vast majority of people in Asia and Africa have the common experience of suffering or still suffering from the scourge of imperialism. This common experience and encounter binds the hearts of the Asian-African people together. Therefore, the desire for unity and friendship and the spirit of mutual understanding and consultation run through the speeches of representatives from various countries and the resolutions of the conference from beginning to end. This conference was a continuation and development of the Bandung Conference. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly proposed by the Prime Ministers of China and India, and China and Burma, and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference were promoted and carried forward. The historically significant major resolutions unanimously adopted by the conference are the most vivid and powerful proof. This conference fully demonstrated the great strength of the unity of the Asian-African people and unfolded a new stage of the great unity of the Asian-African people. As the "Appeal to the People of the World" adopted by the conference stated: "The Asian-African people have reached a higher level of unity in the task of supporting peace and have reached the point where they have a common program of action."
    It is a Conference to Denounce Colonialism and Imperialism, a Grand Demonstration Against Racial Discrimination and in Defense of National Independence
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was a conference where the Asian-African people denounced colonialism and imperialism, and a grand demonstration of the Asian-African people against racial discrimination and in defense of national independence. Representatives from Asian and African countries, especially those from countries and regions still suffering from colonial oppression, powerfully exposed the evil colonial system at the conference and condemned with unparalleled anger the imperialist aggression in the Asian and African regions. The Asian-African people clearly see that today, imperialism, especially American imperialism, still seriously threatens the national independence, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Asian and African countries, and infringes upon the freedom and rights to life of the people of various countries. The conference explicitly condemned the Eisenhower Doctrine and aggressive treaties, and in the "Resolution on Imperialism" wrote: "The conference believes that the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine are both interferences in the independence of Arab countries, undermining their sovereignty and endangering their security." The conference declaration also specifically pointed out: "The continued existence of imperialism is incompatible with the new era in which the world finds itself," which is tantamount to ringing a loud death knell for moribund imperialism: The Asian-African people want to completely eradicate all the scourges of imperialism and colonialism and eliminate imperialism and colonialism from the face of the earth! The wheel of history is constantly moving forward. The Asian people have already stood up, and the African people have also stood up one after another. We can no longer tolerate the towering crimes of imperialism in wantonly invading the Asian-African people. The struggle of the Asian-African people against imperialism and colonialism has become an irresistible historical trend of our time!
    The national independence movements of Asian and African countries have made great progress in the past year. The high tide of the national independence movement has surged from Asia to Africa. We are very pleased to see that Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, and other countries have gained independence. We also deeply sympathize with and firmly support the struggle of other African countries and dependencies that are striving for independence and freedom. There were more African representatives participating in this conference than in any previous international conference. It is the first time in modern history that the oppressed peoples of Africa have occupied an important position on the international political stage. A total of twenty-seven countries and regions from Africa sent delegations, accounting for more than half of the total number of participating countries. Some African countries and regions were sending delegations to international conferences for the first time. Some delegations traveled long distances from within Africa, spending more than a month to reach Cairo to participate in the conference. Some delegations overcame numerous obstacles from the colonial authorities and risked arrest and their lives to participate in the conference. This fully demonstrates that the victories won by the Asian-African people in the national independence movement in recent years have had a profound impact and inspiring effect on the people in other regions of Africa. All participating representatives gave warm support to the just struggle of the people of African countries for national independence. The conference specifically announced its strong support for the delegations that had not yet achieved national independence and were at the forefront of the anti-colonialist struggle. Representatives from dependencies and regions such as Algeria, Kenya, Cyprus, Oman, Cameroon, Uganda, Somaliland, Togo, Zanzibar, Chad, and Palestine were cheered and saluted by the conference. Many of the main contents of the resolutions on anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, defending national independence, and opposing racial discrimination are in support of African nations. A separate resolution was made regarding the Algerian issue. We can confidently assert that the heroic and unyielding struggle of the African people against colonialism indicates that the day when colonial rule ends throughout Africa is drawing closer and closer.
　　The Asian-African People Not Only Want to Control Their Own Destiny but Also Actively Participate in Deciding the Destiny of All Mankind
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was also a grand gathering to defend world peace. This conference fully demonstrated that the awakened Asian-African people have become a powerful force in defending world peace. The Asian-African people not only want to control their own destiny but also actively participate in deciding the destiny of all mankind. They deeply know that in today's era, peace is indivisible, and the establishment of lasting peace is inseparable from the movement for national independence. Only when the people of all countries have gained independence and equality can a stable situation of lasting peace be realized. Today, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is still using various military, political, and economic means, adopting overt or covert methods, to desperately pursue a policy of colonial aggression, and is threatening and infringing upon the independence and peace of Asian and African countries everywhere. They are conspiring to create divisions and antagonisms in the Asian and African regions, sparing no effort in using the most despicable and malicious methods to provoke and divide the friendly unity of the Asian-African people in order to achieve their aggressive goals. However, the Asian-African people, who have repeatedly thwarted the United States' war provocations, will more forcefully meet the United States' new war preparation conspiracies. The unity of the Arab countries is strengthening and expanding. Egypt and Syria have recently established the United Arab Republic. Let us sincerely congratulate the people of Egypt and Syria and the Arab people on this new victory.
    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is another conference of great significance following the Bandung Conference. It will have a very significant impact on the future struggles of the Asian-African people to further strive for national independence and defend peace. The great achievements of the conference have been hailed by public opinion in various countries. Even American newspapers have had to admit that "this conference will affect the destiny of mankind for decades to come." A British newspaper also lamented helplessly: "Dulles has suffered the greatest defeat of his life."
    Comrades, friends, the victorious convocation and successful achievement of this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference cannot be separated from the unity of the representatives of various countries participating in the conference and their adherence to the Bandung spirit, especially from the full support and enthusiastic assistance of the Egyptian government and people. The Chinese delegation congratulated the conference on behalf of the Chinese people and expressed high respect and heartfelt gratitude to the host of the conference - the Egyptian government and people.
    During the Chinese delegation's stay in Egypt, which has a long history of culture and anti-imperialist tradition, we were warmly welcomed and graciously received by the Egyptian people. We are very grateful. We felt very honored to have the opportunity to pay our respects to President Nasser. President Nasser led the Egyptian people to achieve a revolutionary victory and repelled the attacks of the British, French, and Israeli aggressors more than a year ago. Our delegation was honored to be invited to participate in the "Victory Day" celebration held in the heroic Port Said on December 23 last year. This day marked the first anniversary of the complete withdrawal of British and French invading troops from Port Said. We saw that the Egyptian people had recovered from the wounds of war in a short period of one year and had rapidly rebuilt Port Said.
    We were also invited to participate in the inaugural meeting of the Egyptian-Chinese Friendship Association, which was established in Cairo on January 2 this year. The friendly relations between the people of China and Egypt have developed rapidly over the past two years. We believe that the establishment of the Egyptian-Chinese Friendship Association will further promote the fraternal friendship between our two peoples.
    During our stay in Egypt, we also witnessed the enthusiastic welcome of the Egyptian people and representatives of various countries to the Soviet representatives. In particular, when the Soviet representatives proposed at the conference to provide Asian and African countries with economic assistance without any political conditions, they received stormy applause from the representatives of participating countries. This vivid scene showed the deep friendship between the Soviet people and the people of Asian and African countries. The series of peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union has increasingly won popular support. In the resolution on disarmament and the elimination of the threat of atomic war, the conference solemnly appealed to the United States and Britain to respond to the Soviet government's proposal to immediately halt nuclear weapons tests.
　　The Chinese People Fully Agree with the Various Resolutions of the Conference and are Willing to Strive to the End for their Thorough Implementation
    Comrades, this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held after the meeting of sixty-four communist and workers' parties in Moscow in October 1957, which issued a declaration of peace, and the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in December. The various resolutions of the conference are a strong support for the Moscow Peace Declaration and a solemn protest against the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council. From the situation of these three major international conferences held one after another, it can be clearly seen that the forces of peace of socialist countries, nationally independent countries, and peace-loving people around the world have overwhelmed the forces of war of imperialism. It vividly demonstrates the new turning point of our time: the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind.
    We Chinese people have always firmly supported the struggles of the people of all countries for independence, peace, and friendly unity. We believe that the declaration and resolutions adopted by this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference are in line with the position and wishes of our people. We Chinese people fully agree with and warmly support these resolutions, and are willing to work with the people of Asian and African countries to continue to work hard, overcome various difficulties and obstacles, and jointly strive for the thorough implementation of the various resolutions.
    In order to ease international tensions and maintain world peace, the Soviet government has recently once again put forward a series of practical and feasible peace proposals on the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, universal disarmament, and the convening of a summit conference of great powers. This is fully in line with the common desire of the people of the world for peace and a life of tranquility, and has therefore been universally welcomed and endorsed. We Chinese people fully support these positive proposals and suggestions of the Soviet Union and hope that they can be realized as soon as possible. Although the US government, disregarding the earnest expectations of the people of the world, stubbornly obstructs the realization of Soviet peace proposals, continues to step up its frantic arms race, and continues to pursue aggressive policies of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and infringing on the sovereignty of other countries, the historical trend of all mankind demanding peace cannot be stopped by any reactionary force.
    We Chinese people also wholeheartedly support the reasonable proposal put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the 5th of this month regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful reunification of Korea. Our government issued a statement on the 7th of this month fully supporting the peace initiative of the Korean government, and is prepared to consult with the Korean government on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and requires the United States and other countries to take measures to withdraw troops from South Korea. The statement of our government is wholeheartedly supported by us Chinese people. We hope that the governments of all countries, especially the US government, will quickly make a wise choice. If the US government refuses to withdraw its troops from Korea, occupies South Korea for a long time as a colony and war base, and seizes the opportunity to re-launch a war of aggression in an attempt to extend the reactionary rule of South Korea to North Korea, we must once again warn the US aggressors: since such illusions could not be realized by you seven years ago, at a time when the strength of the Korean people has become even stronger, the anti-imperialist movement of the Asian-African people and the world peace wave are unprecedentedly high, you can only be playing with fire and burning yourselves, and will inevitably suffer a more ignominious defeat!
    Comrades, here I would also like to especially mention that the US aggressive forces should withdraw completely from Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait, and the Penghu Islands as soon as possible. Taiwan is an inalienable sacred territory of our country, and the liberation of Taiwan is our internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. We firmly oppose any conspiracy to create "two Chinas." In order to maintain the integrity of our territory, we must liberate Taiwan and enable our compatriots in Taiwan to escape from their miserable life and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.
    Comrades, the development of the international situation is conducive to peace and to our socialist construction. The great achievements and victory of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and the unprecedented strengthening and development of the world peace forces have given us greater encouragement and confidence. We must further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, better unite the countries of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, and strive for more brilliant achievements in the noble cause of peace!
    Now, a vigorous upsurge of production and construction has been set off in our country, and a new atmosphere unprecedented in our history has emerged. Let us warmly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao, give full play to revolutionary enthusiasm for building a socialist motherland, and with the vigor of revolutionary optimism, ride the wind and waves and bravely advance! We must adhere to the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and use our great leap forward on the production and labor front to complete and overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan more, faster, better, and more economically, and to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer! This will be a powerful practical action and a major contribution of our Chinese people to strengthening world peace and promoting the cause of human progress.
    The days when the evil colonialism and imperialism will be completely eliminated from the earth are not far away. The people of the whole world will surely achieve a thorough, final, and comprehensive victory in the great common cause of maintaining independence and peace, eliminating imperialist wars of aggression, and promoting human happiness in the not-too-distant future!
    Long live the great unity of the Asian-African people!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
    Long live world peace!

　　使东风进一步压倒西风！
    亚非人民团结大会的经过和成就
    出席亚非团结大会中国代表团团长　郭沫若各位同志、各位朋友：
    去年12月14日我们首都各界的代表在这里举行了支持召开亚非人民团结大会的会议，欢送了我们出席亚非人民团结大会的中国代表团。今天，我们又在这里隆重集会庆祝亚非人民团结大会所获得的重大成就和胜利，请允许我代表中国代表团向各位并向全国人民报告会议的经过和成就。
    亚非人民团结大会是自1957年12月26日起在埃及首都开罗举行的，先后经过了七天热烈而融洽的讨论，一致通过了一系列重要的决议，于今年1月1日胜利闭幕。正如毛泽东主席在给大会的贺电中所预期的一样，这次大会对于发扬万隆精神，促进亚非人民团结，争取和维护亚非民族独立以及保卫亚洲、非洲和世界和平的伟大事业，作出了巨大的贡献。这一历史性的贡献是值得亚非各国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民欢欣庆贺的。
　　显示了亚非人民团结的伟大力量  展开了亚非人民大团结的新阶段
    参加这次大会的有将近五十个亚洲和非洲的国家和地区，代表有五百零八人。许多西方国家、东欧兄弟国家和国际组织都派了观察员参加。它是1955年万隆会议以来亚非各国人民规模最大的一次和平团结集会，在亚非的历史上是空前的。它有力地表达了居住在亚非两洲约七千多万平方公里土地上的、占世界人口三分之二的十七亿亚非人民争取独立自由和维护世界和平的共同要求，同时也反映了全世界爱好和平与自由的人们的普遍愿望。
    七天的大会始终是在热烈友好的气氛中进行的。按照会议议程，大会听取了有关国家所作的各项报告，即政治报告（包括国际形势、帝国主义问题、殖民主义问题、阿尔及利亚问题、种族歧视问题和核武器问题等），经济报告，文化报告和社会报告。此外，各国代表团团长也都在大会上发了言。大会除了全体会议外，还分别成立了政治、经济、文化、社会和组织五个委员会讨论了各项有关问题，并一致通过了亚非人民团结大会宣言，关于帝国主义的决议、关于联合国问题的决议、关于裁军和消除原子战争威胁的决议、关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议、关于种族歧视问题的决议、关于支持巴勒斯坦问题的决议以及关于文化问题、经济问题、社会发展问题和组织问题的决议，并决定本年3月2日为禁止核武器日，3月30日为声援阿尔及利亚日。在这里应该特别指出的，是在关于联合国问题的决议中明确地提出：“必须恢复中国在联合国中的合法的正当的地位”，我们感谢亚非各国人民对我国人民的支持。为了履行大会的这些决议并促进加强亚非团结运动，大会已设立了一个常设机构，定名为“亚非团结理事会”，下设常设秘书处，总部在开罗；秘书长由埃及担任，十位秘书由喀麦隆、中国、加纳、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、日本、苏丹、叙利亚和苏联分别担任。理事会同时还推选了埃及担任理事会主席，由阿尔及利亚、印度、苏联和苏丹担任副主席。
    这次大会的代表性是很广泛的。代表中有国会议长，政府部长，前总理，各党派领袖，政治活动家，宗教、科学、文艺各界的领袖以及各阶层的代表人物。这些代表尽管来自各个不同的国家和地区，它们的社会制度、意识形态、语言和风俗习惯尽管各不相同，但是，在大会上大家都有共同的语言，即反对帝国主义和殖民主义，要求独立平等与和平。亚非绝大部分的人民有着遭受过或者还在遭受着帝国主义祸害的共同经历。这种共同经历和遭遇把亚非人民的心连在一起。因此，团结友好的愿望以及相互谅解的协商精神自始至终贯穿着各国代表的发言和大会的决议。这次大会是万隆会议的继续和发展。由中印、中缅总理共同提出的和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则获得了发扬光大。大会一致通过的具有历史意义的重大决议就是最生动有力的证明。这次大会充分地显示了亚非人民团结的伟大力量，展开了亚非人民大团结的新阶段。正如大会通过的“告世界人民书”所说：“亚非人民在支持和平的任务中已经达到了更高度的团结，而且已经达到了有共同的行动纲领的地步”。
    是声讨殖民主义和帝国主义的大会  是反对种族歧视和维护民族独立的大示威
    亚非人民团结大会是亚非人民声讨殖民主义和帝国主义的大会，是亚非人民反对种族歧视和维护民族独立的大示威。亚非各国的代表，特别是那些仍然受着殖民主义压迫的国家和地区的代表在大会上有力地揭发了万恶的殖民制度，无比愤怒地斥责了帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略活动。亚非人民清楚地看到，今天，帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，仍然严重地威胁着亚非各国的民族独立、国家主权和领土完整，侵犯着各国人民的自由和生活权利。大会明确地谴责了艾森豪威尔主义和侵略性的条约，在“关于帝国主义的决议”中这样写着：“大会认为，巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义都是干涉阿拉伯国家独立、损害它们的主权和危及它们的安全的”。大会宣言也特别指出：“帝国主义的继续存在和现在世界所处的新时代是不相容的”，这不啻是为穷途末路的帝国主义敲起了响亮的丧钟：亚非人民要彻底铲除帝国主义和殖民主义的一切祸害，要把帝国主义和殖民主义从地球上消灭干净！历史的车轮不断地前进，亚洲人民已经站立起来了，非洲人民也相继站起来了，我们再不能容忍帝国主义对亚非人民肆意侵略的滔天暴行。亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争，已经成为我们时代的不可抗拒的历史潮流了！
    亚非各国的民族独立运动在过去一年中有了巨大的发展。民族独立运动的高潮，从亚洲涌到了非洲。我们非常高兴地看到苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳等获得了独立。我们也深切地同情和坚决支持非洲其他国家和附属地正在为争取独立自由的斗争。参加这次大会的非洲代表比以前任何一次国际会议都多，非洲被压迫民族在国际政治舞台上占据重要的地位，在近代历史上这是第一次。来自非洲的代表团共有二十七个国家和地区，占与会国总数的一半以上，其中有些非洲国家和地区是第一次派遣代表团出席国际会议的。有的代表团是从非洲内部长途跋涉，花了一个多月的时间来到开罗参加大会的。有的代表团是克服了殖民当局的重重阻碍，冒着被逮捕和生命危险来参加大会的。这充分说明了亚非人民这几年在争取民族独立运动中所获得的胜利，已对非洲其他地区的人民发生了深远的推动作用和鼓舞作用。全体与会代表对非洲各国人民争取民族独立的正义斗争给予了热烈的支持，大会曾特别宣布大力支持尚未取得民族独立的、站在反殖民主义斗争最前线的代表团。阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、塞浦路斯、阿曼、喀麦隆、乌干达、索马里兰、多哥、桑给巴尔、乍得和巴勒斯坦等附属国和地区的代表受到了大会的欢呼和敬礼。大会对于反帝国主义、反殖民主义、维护民族独立、反对种族歧视等决议的主要内容很多是支持非洲民族的。关于阿尔及利亚问题并作出了单独的决议。非洲人民英勇不屈地向殖民主义者的斗争，我们可以断定，它在整个非洲结束殖民主义统治的日子已经愈来愈近了。
　　亚非人民不仅要掌握自己的命运而且要积极参加决定全人类的命运
    亚非人民团结大会同时是保卫世界和平的盛大集会。这次大会充分显示了觉醒了的亚非人民已经成为保卫世界和平的一支强大队伍。亚非人民不仅要掌握自己的命运，而且要积极参加决定全人类的命运。他们深深地知道，在今天的时代，和平是不可分割的，而持久和平的确立是同争取民族独立运动分不开的。只有各国人民都获得了独立和平等，持久和平的稳定局面才可能实现。在今天以美国为首的帝国主义集团，仍然在利用军事的、政治的和经济的种种手段，采取公开的或者隐蔽的方式，拼命推行殖民侵略政策，到处威胁和侵犯亚非国家的独立和和平。他们正阴谋在亚非地区制造分裂和对立，不惜用最卑鄙恶毒的手法来挑拨和分化亚非各国人民的友好团结，实现他们的侵略目的。然而，一再挫败了美国的战争挑衅的亚非人民，将更有力地迎击美国的新的备战阴谋。阿拉伯国家的团结正在加强和扩大。埃及和叙利亚最近已成立了阿拉伯联合共和国。让我们衷心祝贺埃叙人民和阿拉伯人民这一新的胜利。
    亚非人民团结大会是继万隆会议之后又一次具有重大意义的大会，对于今后亚非人民进一步争取民族独立和保卫和平的斗争，将发生极重大的作用。大会的伟大成就受到了各国人民舆论的欢呼。连美国的报纸也不得不承认：“这次会议将影响人类今后几十年的命运”。一家英国报纸也无可奈何地感慨地说：“杜勒斯遭到了一生中最大的挫败”。
    同志们、朋友们，这次亚非人民团结大会的胜利召开和获得圆满的成就，是同参加大会的各国代表团结一致、对万隆精神的信守分不开的，特别是同埃及政府和人民的全力支持和热情帮助分不开的。中国代表团曾代表中国人民对大会祝贺并特别对大会的东道主——埃及政府和人民表示了崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    中国代表团在具有悠久的文化和反帝国主义传统的埃及的期间，备受了埃及人民的热烈欢迎和隆情招待，我们非常感谢。我们感到很荣幸地有机会向纳赛尔总统致敬。纳赛尔总统领导埃及人民取得了革命的胜利，并且在一年多前打退了英、法、以侵略者的进攻。我们代表团很荣幸地应邀参加了去年12月23日在英雄的塞得港举行的“胜利节”庆祝大会。这一天是英、法侵略军从塞得港完全撤退的一周年。我们看到了埃及人民在短短的一年期间恢复了战争创伤，已经迅速地把塞得港重新建设了起来。
    我们还应邀参加了今年1月2日在开罗成立的埃中友好协会成立大会。中埃两国人民的友好关系两年多来有了迅速的发展，我们相信，埃中友好协会的成立，将更进一步推动我们两国人民兄弟般的友谊向前发展。
    我们在埃及期间也看到了埃及人民和各国代表对苏联代表的热烈的欢迎。特别是苏联代表在大会上提出给亚非国家以不附有任何政治条件的经济援助的建议时，受到了与会各国代表暴风雨般的掌声。这个生动的场面，显示了苏联人民同亚非各国人民之间的深切的友谊。苏联所提出的一系列的和平建议已日益深入人心。大会在关于裁军和消除原子战争威胁的决议中，就已曾严正地向美英两国呼吁：响应苏联政府的建议，立即停止核武器试验。
　　中国人民完全同意大会的各项决议  并愿为其彻底实现奋斗到底
    同志们，这次亚非人民团结大会是在1957年10月莫斯科六十四个共产党和工人党举行会议作出和平宣言以及12月北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议之后举行的。大会的各项决议是对莫斯科和平宣言的有力支持，是对北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议的严正抗议。从这三个相继召开的重大国际会议的情况可以很清楚地看到：社会主义国家、民族独立国家以及全世界爱好和平人民的和平力量，已经压倒了帝国主义的战争力量。它生动地表现了我们时代的新的转折点：东风压倒了西风。
    我们中国人民一向坚决支持各国人民为独立和平和友好团结的斗争。我们认为这次亚非人民团结大会所通过的宣言和各项决议，是符合我国人民这一立场和愿望的。我们中国人民完全同意并热烈拥护这些决议，并且愿意和亚非各国人民一起，继续努力，克服各种困难和阻碍，为彻底实现各项决议而共同奋斗。
    为了缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平，苏联政府最近就禁止试验核武器，普遍裁军和召开大国首脑会议再一次提出了一系列切实可行的和平建议。这是完全符合当前世界人民渴望和平和安宁生活的共同愿望的，因而受到了普遍的欢迎和赞同。我们中国人民完全支持苏联的这些积极的主张和建议，并希望能尽速地得到实现。尽管美国政府不顾世界人民的殷切期待，顽固地阻挠苏联和平建议的实现，仍在加紧疯狂备战，继续推行干涉别国内政、侵犯别国主权的侵略政策，然而全人类要求和平的历史潮流不是任何反动的力量所能阻挡得了的。
    我们中国人民同样衷心支持本月5日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所提出的关于撤退一切外国军队、和平统一朝鲜的合理建议。我国政府已于本月7日发表声明完全支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议，准备同朝鲜政府磋商撤出中国人民志愿军，并要求美国和其他各国采取措施从南朝鲜撤出军队。我国政府的声明，我们中国人民全心全意地拥护。我们希望各国政府，特别是美国政府，迅速采取明智的抉择。如果美国政府拒绝从朝鲜撤退军队，长久霸占着南朝鲜作为殖民地和战争基地，并伺机重新发动侵略战争，企图把南朝鲜的反动统治扩展到北朝鲜，我们要再一次警告美国侵略者：这样的幻想在七年前你们既然不能实现，在今天朝鲜人民的力量已经更加壮大、亚非各国人民反帝国主义运动和全世界和平浪潮空前高涨的时候，你们只能是玩火自焚，必然遭受到更可耻的失败！
    同志们，在这里我还要特别提到，美国侵略势力应该尽快地完全从台湾、台湾海峡和澎湖列岛撤退出去。台湾是我国不可分割的神圣领土，解放台湾是我国内政问题，不容许外国干涉。我们坚决反对制造“两个中国”的任何阴谋。为了保持领土的完整，我们一定要解放台湾，使台湾同胞早一日脱离水深火热的生活，回到祖国的怀抱。
    同志们，国际局势的发展是有利于和平，有利于我们进行社会主义建设的。亚非人民团结大会的重大成就和胜利，世界和平力量的空前壮大和发展，都给了我们更大的鼓舞和信心。我们要进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，更好地团结亚非各国和全世界人民，为崇高的和平事业获得更辉煌的成就而努力奋斗！
    现在，在我们全国各地，都掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产建设高潮，出现了在我国历史上空前未有的新气象。让我们热烈响应党中央、人民政府和毛主席的号召，为了建设社会主义祖国，鼓足革命的干劲，以革命乐观主义的朝气，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！我们要坚持勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，用我们在生产劳动战线上的大跃进，来更多、更快、更好、更省地完成和超额完成第二个五年计划和在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的光荣任务！这样将是当前我们中国人民对增强世界和平和促进人类进步事业的一种有力的实际行动和重大贡献。
    万恶的殖民主义和帝国主义从地球上被彻底消灭的日子已经不远了。全世界人民为维护独立与和平、为消灭帝国主义侵略战争、为促进人类幸福的伟大的共同事业，在不长远的期间，一定会取得彻底的最后的全面的胜利！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
