Xinhua News Agency Report: Capital art performance troupes and specially formed performance teams, on an unprecedented scale, are going deep into mountainous areas, old liberated areas in the countryside, and factories and military units during the Spring Festival to perform. The actors are stepping up rehearsals and preparing to set off, determined to take a big step forward along the path of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

More than ten performing arts groups have formed performance teams that will go to the mountainous rural areas of the Jingxi Mining Area and the mountainous old liberated areas of Hebei and Shanxi to perform for the peasants. Performance teams from the Beijing People's Art Theater and the China Pingju Theater, among others, will go to remote mountain villages in the Jingxi Mining Area. The China Peking Opera Theater will go to the Changping mountainous area in the suburbs of Beijing. The China Youth Art Theater and China Pingju Theater teams will go to the Guanting Reservoir, Shacheng area, and Longhua, the hometown of martyr Dong Cunrui. The Central Song and Dance Ensemble, led by Huo Xiyang, will go to Zuoquan, Shanxi Province, to perform for the people of the old revolutionary base area. The Central Experimental Opera Theater, led by Deputy Dean Lü Peng, will go to the old revolutionary base areas in Fuping and Mancheng to perform. Also performing in Hebei and Shanxi are the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the Beijing Quyi Troupe No. 3, and the New China Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe.

The performance teams have paid special attention to rehearsing many programs that are popular with farmers and reflect real life. The Beijing People's Art Theater visited farmers in the Jingxi Mining Area beforehand and, based on their preferences and requests, broke the convention of only performing dramas. In addition to rehearsing the dramas "The Unfinished Play" and "The Peddler," they also rehearsed various programs such as opera, crosstalk, double act, magic, chorus, storytelling, and dance. The theater's main actors, Tian Chong, Hu Zongwen, Zhao Yunru, Ma Qun, Yang Wei, and others, also plan to write impromptu sketches and crosstalk programs during the performances to be performed in a timely manner. The dance team, chorus team, and orchestra of the Central Song and Dance Ensemble have prepared dances such as "Lion Dance," "Tatar Dance," "Fan Dance," and song and dance "Northeast Yangko Dance." There are also twenty-four programs including famous Shaanxi folk songs, famous Shanxi folk songs, and a medley of Northwest folk songs full of Spring Festival festive atmosphere. These programs include folk songs, dances, and songs from ethnic minorities such as Tibetan, Mongolian, and Korean, and from various regions such as Fujian, Yunnan, Anhui, and Hebei. The troupe wants to understand the farmers' preferences through this performance. The China Peking Opera Theater has also rehearsed more than twenty programs such as "Ancient City Meeting" and "Baishuitan" based on the farmers' preferences. The newly rehearsed programs by the Central Experimental Opera Theater include the opera "Female Commune Member," "Four Daughters Pay New Year's Greetings," as well as Huangmei Opera, Henan Opera, Hunan Flower Drum Opera, and so on.

The actors are preparing to participate in this performance with heroic feelings. The actors who will perform in mountainous areas such as Zuoquan and Fuping, "at the top of Taihang Mountain and on the bank of the Zhang River," will carry their own light luggage, performance costumes, soft scenery, etc., to perform for the heroic people across mountains and ridges. The actors of the Central Song and Dance Ensemble will go to Yanhe Township, an area often frequented by guerrillas during the Anti-Japanese War, in the Jingxi Mining Area on the second day of the Lunar New Year. It is said that the farmers in this area have never seen a performance by a troupe, and this time the actors will climb over a mountain thirteen li high to bring them the programs. In this mountainous area, they will perform for fifteen days and trek more than two hundred li. In addition to performing, they will also participate in labor with the villagers. At present, the actors of some theaters are stepping up rehearsals and exercising their bodies. Some actors have also posted big-character posters expressing their determination to perform well and improve themselves.

During the Spring Festival, theaters and troupes performing for rural areas, factories, and military units in various districts of Beijing will perform more than 100 Peking Opera, Ping Opera, drama, Yue Opera, song and dance, Quyi, and other rich and colorful programs. Well-known Chinese Peking Opera actors Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun, Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, Li Shaochun, Wu Suqiu, Du Jinfang, Ping Opera actress Xiao Baiyushuang, Xi Cailian, as well as many major actors in Quyi and drama, will perform their best plays. Students from the Central Academy of Drama, the New China Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe student class, and the Tianjin Yue Opera Troupe, which is on a tour of Beijing, will also participate in the performances.
