　　Contact Agricultural Cooperatives to Promote the Great Leap Forward in Production
　　Symposium of Universities and Scientific Research Units in Shaanxi
　　Xi'an, February 7th (by our reporters Li Qian and Zhu Bo) - How agricultural schools and scientific research institutions can strengthen their ties with agricultural cooperatives, help summarize the production experiences of the masses, impart scientific and technical knowledge, and promote the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production were the main topics discussed at a symposium convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on February 2nd. Participants included representatives from Northwest Agricultural College, Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute, Northwest Biology Research Institute, Soil and Water Testing Institute, Xi'an Science Association, Popular Science Association, Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, county heads from more than ten counties including Yan'an and Hanzhong, and heads of agricultural experiment stations, technology promotion stations, and some agricultural cooperatives. The meeting was presided over by Comrade Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee.
　　At the meeting, Kang Di, Vice President of Northwest Agricultural College, and Wang Baojing, Director of Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, first introduced their past experiences in establishing regular contact and helping each other. In early 1955, Northwest Agricultural College sent four teachers, including Professor Su Xianzhong, to the cooperative to help summarize the experience of high corn yields, help formulate a complete and detailed set of technical regulations for cultivating corn, and taught cooperative members many new technologies such as preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and cultivating cotton. They also organized sixteen teaching and research groups to help Qianjin Cooperative with its long-term planning and annual plans. The Agricultural College also ran accounting training classes, livestock breeding training classes, and castor silkworm breeding training classes to help agricultural cooperatives train technical personnel.
　　The result of strengthening contacts has brought many benefits to schools and agricultural cooperatives. The unit area yield of agricultural cooperatives has increased year by year, livestock and poultry have reproduced vigorously, and the income of cooperative members has increased year by year. Thanks to strengthening its ties with agricultural cooperatives, many teachers and students from the Agricultural College often went to agricultural cooperatives to eat, live, and work with the farmers, which played a great role in their ideological transformation. At the same time, this was also a good opportunity for teachers to further their studies. This can improve the quality of teaching and enrich the content of scientific research. For example, the college often used materials from Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative as teaching materials in many courses such as cultivation and enterprise organization, and many teachers and students often summarized some of the work they had done to help agricultural cooperatives and published them as scientific research papers.
　　This year, Northwest Agricultural College, combined with the assignment of teachers and students to participate in labor, has expanded its ties with agricultural cooperatives. In addition to some agricultural cooperatives in Wugong and Liquan, it has also established key points in Shangxian and Suide counties. In addition, seven counties, including Yangxian, Ankang, Zhashui, Yanchuan, Yan'an, Yulin, and Jingbian, have been designated as regular contact points, and people have been sent to live in key counties and cooperatives.
　　All the participants agreed that the above experience was very good, and believed that it was an indispensable part of marching towards science and ensuring a great leap forward in agriculture. Representatives from northern Shaanxi, southern Shaanxi, and the Qinling Mountains eagerly hoped that scientific workers would go deep into their areas to help them summarize and improve their existing experience, and help them solve problems in production, so as to quickly realize their Great Leap Forward plans.
　　During the symposium, many positive suggestions were put forward on the issue of combining scientific research institutions and schools with practice and serving production. Some people proposed establishing an agricultural technology guidance committee to organize forces from all sides to solve major problems in agricultural production. Others suggested that schools and scientific research units should run correspondence courses, training courses, etc., to train or improve agricultural technical forces.
　　Comrade Zhang Desheng pointed out at the meeting that the experience of Northwest Agricultural College and Fenghuo Cooperative and other agricultural cooperatives in establishing regular contacts was successful and could be promoted throughout the province. This is an important measure to improve the level of agricultural technology and promote the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. It is entirely possible for agricultural scientific research departments in the Shaanxi area to establish extensive ties with agricultural cooperatives, because the agricultural scientific research force in the Shaanxi area is very strong. There is an agricultural college, two agricultural scientific research institutions, a hydraulic engineering experiment institute, ten agricultural technical schools, and agricultural experiment stations, technology promotion stations, and experimental farms throughout the counties. If we give full play to the potential of these scientific and technical personnel, combine them with the technical reforms of agricultural cooperatives, and establish close ties between them and agricultural cooperatives, a mighty army will be formed throughout the province to march towards agricultural science. At the same time, scientific workers are now eager to go down, and agricultural cooperatives and county and district party and government agencies are actively extending their hands, which are in urgent need of help and welcome technical personnel to go down. Therefore, it is entirely possible to widely carry out the work of combining scientific research departments with agricultural cooperatives throughout the province.
　　Finally, based on the opinions and suggestions put forward by everyone during the symposium, Comrade Zhang Desheng put forward opinions on giving full play to the potential of agricultural scientific research departments and agricultural schools, and strengthening the ties between these units and agricultural cooperatives: The province, special districts, counties, districts, and townships should establish technical guidance committees as staff departments for the Party and government organs to lead agricultural production, and unify the technical forces of all parties under the leadership of the Party and government at all levels. The main task of the committee is to organize agricultural scientific forces from all sides to collaborate, exchange experience, summarize the production experience of the masses, impart scientific and technical knowledge, solve technical problems in production, and put forward specific measures to the Party and government leaders for increasing agricultural production. Agricultural colleges, technical schools, and scientific research institutions should universally establish contacts with agricultural cooperatives through various methods such as signing contracts, making friends, and sending people to reside in cooperatives. In the future, the province, special districts, and counties at all levels plan to organize forces from all sides and adopt various methods such as technical training classes, technical research groups, lecturer groups, and regional single-crop technical conferences to conduct technical dissemination and promote advanced experience. Help the main responsible persons of the Party and government learn technology by establishing cadre refresher courses, setting up agricultural technology courses in Party schools and cadre schools, and having technical cadres and Party and government leaders cooperate in conducting experimental fields. The county party committee should exercise unified leadership, and the key points of various agricultural colleges, schools, and scientific research institutions should be located in the county. Divide various types of regions and set up key points to strengthen scientific and technical guidance to the key points to establish banners of high yield and promote overall development.

　　联系农业社促进生产大跃进
    陕西高等学校和科学研究单位座谈
    本报西安7日电　本报记者李茜、朱波报道：农业学校和科学研究机构，如何与农业社加强联系，帮助总结群众的生产经验，传授科学技术，促进农业生产大跃进，这是中共陕西省委于2月2日召集的座谈会所讨论的主要内容。参加会议的有西北农学院、西北农业科学研究所、西北生物研究所、水土试验所、西安科联、科普、陕西省农业厅以及延安、汉中等十多个县的县长和农业试验站、技术推广站的负责人及部分农业社的代表，会议由省委第一书记张德生同志主持。
    会议首先由西北农学院副院长康迪，醴泉县烽火农业社主任王保京等介绍了他们过去建立了经常联系，互相帮助的经验。1955年初，西北农学院派苏显忠教授等四个教师到该社帮助总结玉米丰产经验，帮助制定了一套完整细致的栽培玉米的技术细则，而且教会了社员们防治病虫害，务育棉花等很多新的技术。他们还组织了十六个教研组帮助前进社搞远景规划和年度计划，农学院还开办了会计训练班、牲畜饲养员训练班和饲养蓖麻蚕训练班、帮助农业社培养技术人员。
    加强联系的结果，给学校和农业社带来很多好处。农业社的单位面积产量逐年提高，牲畜家禽繁殖旺盛，社员收入年年增加。农学院由于加强和农业社的联系，不少教师和学生经常到农业社去，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，这对他们的思想改造起了很大的作用。同时，对教师也是一个很好的进修机会。这样可以提高教学质量，充实科学研究工作的内容。如该院在耕作、企业组织等许多课程中就经常引用前进农业社的材料作为教材，很多教师和学生也经常把帮助农业社进行的一些工作进行总结后作为科学研究论文发表。
    今年，西北农学院结合师生下放参加劳动，又扩大了和农业社的联系，除武功和醴泉的一些农业社外，又在商县、绥德两县建立了重点。另外，还确定洋县、安康、柞水、延川、延安、榆林、靖边等七县为经常联系点。并派人住在重点县、社。
    到会的人都认为上述经验很好，认为这是向科学进军、保证农业大跃进不可缺少的部分。来自陕北、陕南和秦岭山区的代表们迫切希望科学工作者们深入下去，帮助他们总结并提高已有的经验；帮助他们解决生产中的问题，以便迅速地实现自己的大跃进计划。
    在座谈中，大家就科学研究机关和学校与实际结合，为生产服务问题提出不少积极建议。有人提出建立农业技术指导委员会，以便把各方面的力量组织起来，解决农业生产中的重大问题。还有人建议学校、科学研究单位举办函授班、训练班等，培养或提高农业技术力量等。
    张德生同志并在会上指出：农学院和烽火社等农业社建立经常性的联系经验是成功的，可以在全省范围内推广，这是提高农业技术水平和促进农业生产大跃进的一项重要措施。陕西地区的农业科学研究部门和农业社建立广泛的联系，是完全有条件的，这一方面是因为陕西地区的农业科学研究力量很雄厚，有一个农学院，有两个农业科学研究机构，有水工试验所，十个农业技术学校、遍于各县的农业试验站、技术推广站和实验农场，如果充分发挥这些科学技术人员的潜力，使他们同农业社的技术改革结合起来，使他们和农业社之间建立起密切的联系，就会在全省形成一支声势浩大的向农业科学进军的队伍。同时，目前科学工作者们都迫切要求到下边去，农业社和县、区的党政机关也积极伸出了迫切需要帮助并欢迎技术人员下去的双手。因此，在全省范围内广泛开展科学研究部门与农业社结合这一工作是完全可以做到的。
    最后，张德生同志根据大家在座谈时所提的意见和建议，提出充分发挥农业科学研究部门、农业学校的潜力，并加强这些单位与农业社联系的意见：省、专区、县、区、乡在成立技术指导委员会，是做为党、政机关领导农业生产的参谋部，在各级党政的领导下，统一各方面的技术力量。委员会的主要任务是组织各方面农业科学力量进行协作，交流经验，总结群众的生产经验，传授科学技术，解决生产中的技术问题，并向党政领导提出农业增产的具体措施。农业学院、技校、科学研究机构通过订合同、交朋友派人驻社等各种方式普遍建立与农业社的联系，省、专区、县、各级领导今后准备组织各方面的力量，采取技术训练班、技术研究小组、讲师团、区域性单项作物技术会议等各种方式，进行技术传授，推广先进经验。通过成立干部进修班、党校、干校设立农业技术课程，技术干部和党政领导人员合作搞试验田等方式，帮助党政主要负责人学技术。县委统一领导，各农业院、校、科学研究机关设在该县的重点。划分各种不同类型的地区，设立重点，对重点加强科学技术指导，以便树立丰产旗帜，推动全面。
