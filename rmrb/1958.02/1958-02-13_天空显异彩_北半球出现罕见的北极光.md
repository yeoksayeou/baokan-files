Xinhua News Agency, 12th: A rare "Aurora Borealis" appeared in the Northern Hemisphere on the 11th, visible in parts of Japan, Britain, Canada, and the United States. According to American astronomer Kuiper, it was the most unusual and wide-ranging "Aurora Borealis" he had seen in twenty years.

On the 11th, between 19:00 and 21:00 Tokyo time (10:00 to 12:00 Greenwich time), the Aurora Borealis was seen in the northern and northeastern regions of Japan, from Hokkaido in the north to Tochigi Prefecture in the south. The red aurora extended from the northern sky towards the northeast, in an arc shape. Some of the aurora was linear and vibrated frequently. According to the Japan Central Astronomical Observatory, this was the most unusual aurora observed since the station was established in 1876.

On the night of the 10th and the morning of the 11th, the Aurora Borealis was also seen north of Vero Beach and Florida in the United States. In some areas, the Aurora Borealis looked like a bright or fiery glow, while in other areas it looked like streams of green, white, pink, or purple light.

Southern England, Canada, and parts of Austria also witnessed this most peculiar aurora in recent years.

It is speculated that the occurrence of this aurora is directly related to sunspots and the geomagnetic storm that occurred on the 11th. Due to the disturbance of the magnetic storm, radio communications in a large part of the world, especially radio communications between Europe and the Far East, South and North America, were affected. Radio communications between London and Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand were interrupted for several hours. It is reported that the number of sunspots is still increasing, and the phenomenon of radio interference will continue until around the 17th.

    天空显异彩
    北半球出现罕见的北极光
    新华社12日讯　11日北半球出现了一次前所罕见的“北极光”，日本、英国、加拿大、美国等部分地区均能看见。据美国天文学家科伊伯说，这是他二十年来所看见的一次最奇异、照耀范围最广的“北极光”。
    11日东京时间十九点至二十一点（格林威治时间十点至十二点）之间日本北部和东北部地区，北至北海道，南至枥木县都见到北极光。红色的极光从北部上空向东北方伸展，呈弧形。一部分极光则成线状，时常振动。据日本中央天文观测站说，这是1876年这个站建立以来所观察到的一次最不平常的极光。
    10日夜间和11日早上，美国维罗矶和佛罗里达以北也见到这次的北极光。某些地区看到的北极光像一抹明亮或火红的火光，另一些地区看来则像一道道绿色、白色、粉红色或紫色的流光。
    英格兰南部、加拿大、奥地利部分地区也看见这个近年来最奇特的一次北极光。
    据推测，这次北极光的发生是与太阳的黑子和11日所发生的地磁暴直接相关的。由于磁暴的干扰，世界很大一部分地区的无线电联系，特别是欧洲同远东、南、北美洲间的无线电联系都受到影响。伦敦同新加坡、澳大利亚、新西兰之间的无线电联系曾中断了几个小时。据悉，太阳的黑子现在仍在增加，无线电受到干扰的现象将继续到17日左右。
