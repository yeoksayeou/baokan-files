　　Since the publication of the editorial "Looking at the Whole Country from Mei Lin" in this newspaper on January 8th, less than a month ago, the fire of anti-waste has been ignited in provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, and Shandong. This raging fire is spreading to all parts of the country, to all departments, and to every corner, riding on the momentum of the rectification movement. A nationwide anti-waste campaign is taking shape. Yesterday, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, in his budget report, once again emphasized the importance of building the country through diligence and thrift, and called on all the people to launch an increase production and practice economy movement. "Oppose Waste, Build the Nation Through Thrift" is the action slogan of the people across the country.
    To build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture is the long-cherished ideal of our people and is the highest interest of our people. Our country is still a poor, blank and large country. Poor means that the economy is backward and the living standards of the people are very low. Blank means that the culture is backward and the level of culture and science is very low. Large means that the area is large and the population is large, requiring a great deal. Poverty, blankness, and size require us to build a lot and build quickly so that we can catch up with economically developed countries in a relatively short period of time and meet the growing needs of the 600 million people. To build a lot and build quickly, we need sufficient funds, but our foundation is weak and we do not have that much money yet. This is a contradiction in our country's socialist construction. How to overcome this contradiction? There have been various solutions to this problem throughout history. Some relied on war and the plundering of colonies to solve it. The industrialization of imperialist countries such as Britain and Germany took this path. But this path is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of our country. Some relied on foreign loans to solve it. Tsarist Russia once tried to use this method to achieve industrialization. Our country cannot and should not rely on imperialist funds for construction, because that would mean losing the independence that our people have fought for for many years and becoming an appendage of imperialism, which is very obvious. So, can we rely on socialist countries, that is, rely on the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, to realize our country's socialist industrialization? The Soviet Union and other fraternal countries are very willing to help. In fact, since the founding of the country, our country has received the generous and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. However, the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries also need to build and also need money. We should not rely solely on the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. Moreover, our country needs a lot of construction funds, and relying on fraternal countries cannot satisfy it. The remaining method, and also the best method, is to rely on our own accumulation, that is, to rely on our 600 million people to accumulate money, penny by penny, with their own hands. This requires us to run factories diligently and thriftily, run stores diligently and thriftily, run cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily. We should invigorate the national spirit, boost our energy, strive for the upstream, overcome all difficulties on the road of construction, and struggle to realize our great ideal. Diligence means diligent production, bringing out the energy proposed by the peasants of Henan, "Fighting hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of Henan," making the most of manpower and equipment, striving to improve labor organization, improve business management, improve labor productivity, improve product quality, increase product variety, and reduce product costs, thereby increasing the income of the state, cooperatives, and individuals. Thrift means rationally and economically using the accumulated funds, using every penny for the most urgently needed construction, and using one penny as two, doing as much as possible with as little money as possible. Diligence and thrift are an indivisible unity. Only thrift without diligence cannot increase accumulation more, and cannot carry out construction more, faster, better, and more economically. Only diligence without thrift, spending the hard-earned money casually, of course, cannot carry out construction more, faster, better, and more economically. Therefore, diligence and thrift are not only our method of accumulation, but also our method of construction. Precisely because of this, our Party has put forward the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, pointing out that extravagance and waste are one of the most dangerous things in socialist construction. Therefore, for us, carrying out the struggle against waste is not just a small problem of a few dollars, but a big problem of whether or not we want socialism.
    Our Communist Party has always advocated diligence and thrift and opposed extravagance and waste. As early as twenty-four years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in a report at the Second National Congress of Workers and Peasants convened in Ruijin, Jiangxi: "All government workers should understand that corruption and waste are extremely serious crimes." "Saving every copper for the cause of war and revolution, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, page 129). Since the founding of the country, our Party and government have led the people of the whole country in a continuous struggle against various wasteful phenomena. Among them, the larger-scale ones were the Three-Anti Movement in 1952 and the Thrift Movement in 1955. After the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in 1956, the Party clearly put forward the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, achieving more, faster, better, and more economically. In the past few years, the implementation of this policy has achieved great results. Our country's first five-year plan has been overfulfilled, with the total investment in capital construction exceeding the original plan by more than 4%. The total industrial output value in 1957 has exceeded the original target of the first five-year plan by more than 17%. The total agricultural and sideline output value in 1957 has also exceeded the original target of the first five-year plan by more than 1%. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed greatly. In terms of practicing economy, in 1957 alone, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry appropriately modified the design of some newly built factories based on China's specific conditions, saving 18% to 25% of the investment in capital construction and increasing product variety. Many examples of running enterprises diligently and thriftily have emerged in state-owned industry and local industry.
    Even so, the current potential for savings is still very large. In industrial construction, many comrades do not distinguish between key enterprises and general enterprises, between main workshops and auxiliary workshops, between main equipment and auxiliary equipment, and pursue high standards, mechanization, and automation across the board, so that enterprises that could have been built with less money in a shorter period of time have to spend more money and longer time. According to many surveys, under the premise of ensuring project quality, it is now possible to do things that used to cost 100 yuan with 60 yuan, 70 yuan, or 80 yuan. In non-productive construction, many places still have the phenomenon of too many construction projects and too high standards. For example, the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Administration Design Institute, in this anti-waste movement, used the spirit of revolution, adopted the method of revealing, checking, and improving at the same time, and modified more than 100 engineering designs with excessively high standards and blindly pursuing architectural forms in four days, saving the country more than 6 million yuan in investment.
    In industrial production, commerce, transportation and other enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives, material backlog, material waste, too many defective products, capital backlog, too many business links, too many management personnel, and poor warehouse management are also quite common. In terms of material backlog, for steel alone, the total inventory of enterprises nationwide in 1957 exceeded the reasonable production turnover by about one-third.
    In many agencies, troops, schools, hospitals, and other institutions, many operating expenses are used inappropriately, and the potential for savings is also very large. Many business systems are complicated, institutions are overlapping, and financial management is poor. Some undertakings that have the nature of public welfare undertakings could have been launched by the masses to run on their own or with public assistance, but they are all funded by the state, and some of the standards are very high. The state plans to spend 6.4 billion yuan on operating expenses in 1958. If some overlapping institutions are appropriately reduced, personnel are reduced, and expense standards are lowered, then it is entirely possible to save 300 to 500 million yuan.
    In agricultural production, some cooperatives, after their income and accumulation have increased, do not first use it to expand reproduction, but use it for non-productive construction such as offices and clubs. This is also not in line with the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily.
    The many wasteful phenomena mentioned above are certainly very serious, but compared with the great achievements of our construction, they are at most nine fingers out of ten. Our achievements are the main ones, and our shortcomings are the secondary ones. We have only been building the country for nine years, and we have only been carrying out planned large-scale construction for five years. Due to lack of experience, due to the low level of technology, and not having fully grasped the laws of construction and production, some waste is excusable, just like a child falling when learning to walk, which is unavoidable. For example, when some factories were built, due to insufficient understanding of our country's national conditions, the construction standards and the degree of mechanization and automation were set too high. Some factories have roughly the same production process and are very close to each other, some only separated by a wall or a road, but they did not build factories according to the principle of collaboration, and each factory built its own tool, repair, carpentry and other workshops and laboratories, resulting in more money spent and very low equipment utilization rates. These are unavoidable in the early stages of construction. However, these types of waste must also be corrected. Because children always grow up. We have had the construction experience of the first five years. As long as we seriously summarize the past experience and lessons, we can improve our understanding of objective things, and we can turn things that were once unavoidable into avoidable things.
    However, much waste is caused by the ideological errors of staff. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In making plans, doing things, and thinking about problems, we must proceed from the fact that our country has a population of 600 million. Don't forget this point." Some comrades forgot to proceed from the point of 600 million people when doing things and thinking about problems, shrinking the circle smaller and smaller, and only proceeding from their own unit. No matter what factories, schools, hospitals, and other non-productive buildings they build, they require "a century of great plans," they want "perfection," "novelty," and "greatness." Not only productive buildings must be complete, but also non-productive dormitories and welfare buildings must be complete; not only houses must be large, but also green areas and roads must be large; not only main production equipment must be of international standards, but also secondary equipment and non-productive supplies must be of international standards. These comrades are very enthusiastic. In isolation, they have indeed built a good factory, a good school, and a good hospital. But they do not understand that everywhere "seeks completeness," "seeks greatness," and "seeks novelty," and everything "seeks completeness," "seeks greatness," and "seeks novelty," we will not be able to use limited funds to build more factories, mines, farmland utilization, schools, and hospitals in a relatively short period of time, and we will not be able to more quickly meet the growing material and cultural needs of the 600 million people.
    There are also some leading personnel of enterprises, agencies, schools, and institutions who do not conscientiously treat their work, or they are high above, do not go deep into the grassroots, or they do not consult with the masses when encountering problems, do not rely on the masses, and replace the Party's policies with feelings, and replace objective reality with conjecture. This is also a cause of waste.
    No matter what kind of error is caused, it is detrimental to carrying out socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically. Therefore, the Party Central Committee requires every enterprise, agency, school, hospital, and cooperative to launch an anti-waste movement in the rectification stage of the rectification movement, mobilize the masses, organize special forums and special debates on anti-waste, expose various wasteful phenomena, analyze the causes of waste, criticize the ideas of "seeking novelty," "seeking completeness," and "seeking greatness" among the staff that do not consider the overall situation, criticize the ideas of neglecting politics, and criticize the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leading personnel, and find ways to fundamentally eliminate waste. For those wasteful phenomena that occur in large-scale mass production and construction movements, they must also be exposed and corrected, but they must start from encouraging the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and not pour cold water or dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. Opposing waste is only to oppose those expenditures that exceed the current national economic level or that should be saved but have not been saved, and it is definitely not to put aside some things that should be done and can be done at present. Opposing waste is only to oppose those raw material reserves and consumption that exceed normal production and construction needs, and it is definitely not to oppose even necessary raw materials and disregard product quality. Therefore, the various wasteful phenomena revealed by the masses must be analyzed realistically and cannot go from one extreme to the other, causing new waste.
    Our country is now facing a new situation of national great leap forward. Industrial construction and industrial production are to leap forward, agricultural production is to leap forward, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings are also to leap forward. We need to do many things. Under this new situation, launching a mass anti-waste movement is of particular importance. On the one hand, through the struggle against waste, we can reduce various national expenditures, increase income, and ensure the financial needs for starting more undertakings. On the other hand, through the struggle against waste, we can promote the fine tradition of hard work of the Chinese people and cultivate a thrifty social atmosphere. On March 2, 1923, Lenin said in "Better Fewer, But Better" about the significance of practicing economy: "Only in this way will we be able to—to use a simile—change horses, that is, change from the peasant, muzhik, beggarly horse, from the horse of economy designed for a ruined peasant country, to the horse which the proletariat is seeking and cannot but seek, the horse of large-scale machine industry, electrification, the Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station, etc." The Soviet people followed Lenin's instructions and, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, have already changed from the poor horse to the horse of large-scale machine industry and electrification in just over thirty years, and have begun to mount the atomic horse. The Soviet Union is our example. As long as we adhere to the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our country will surely quickly change from the current "poor and blank" horse to another rich and strong horse with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and leap forward!

### 我们的行动口号——反对浪费，勤俭建国！

专栏：社论

　　我们的行动口号——反对浪费，勤俭建国！
    自从1月8日本报发表“从梅林看全国”的社论以来，迄今还不到一个月，反浪费之火，已经在上海、北京、天津、江苏、安徽、湖南、贵州、浙江、河北、河南、辽宁、黑龙江、四川、山东等省市燃烧起来。这把烈火，正在乘整风运动之风，向全国各地、各部门、各个角落蔓延。一个全民性的反浪费运动正在形成。昨天，李先念副总理在预算报告中，又一次强调了勤俭建国的重要意义，号召全体人民展开增产节约运动。“反对浪费，勤俭建国”是全国人民的行动口号。
    把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，是我国人民多年以来梦寐以求的理想，是我国人民的最高利益。我国现在还是一个又穷又白又大的国家。穷，就是经济落后，人民的生活水平很低。白，就是文化落后，文化科学水平很低。大，就是幅员大，人口众多，需要很大。穷、白、大，要求我们多多地建设、快快地建设，才能在比较短的时间内赶上经济发达的国家，才能够满足六亿人民日益增长的需要。而要多建设、快建设，就要有足够的资金，但是，我们的底子薄，钱还不是那样多。这是我国进行社会主义建设的一个矛盾。怎样克服这个矛盾？对于这个问题，历史上有过各种不同的解决方法。有靠战争和掠夺殖民地来解决的，英国、德国等帝国主义国家的工业化，就是走这条道路的。但这条道路是跟我们国家的性质根本不相容的。有靠外国贷款来解决的，沙皇俄国就曾想用这种方法实现工业化的。我国不可能也不应该靠帝国主义的资金来建设，因为那样会使我国人民奋斗多年才争取得到的独立丧失，变成为帝国主义的附庸，这是很明显的。那么是否可以依赖社会主义国家，即依赖苏联和其他兄弟国家来实现我国的社会主义工业化呢？苏联和其他兄弟国家是很乐意帮助，事实上，建国以来，我国已经从苏联和其他兄弟国家得到了慷慨的无私的帮助，但苏联和其他兄弟国家也要建设，也很需要钱，我们不应该单纯依赖苏联和其他兄弟国家，何况我国需要的建设资金很大，依靠兄弟国家也是无法满足的。剩下的一种方法，也是最好的方法是靠自己积累，也就是靠我们六亿人民用自己的手把钱一文一文地积累起来。这就需要我们勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办合作社，勤俭办一切事业。我们应该振作民族精神，鼓起干劲，力争上游，克服在建设道路上的一切困难，为实现我们的伟大理想而奋斗。所谓勤，就是勤劳生产，拿出像河南农民所提出的“苦战三年，为根本改变河南的面貌而斗争”的干劲，尽可能充分地利用人力和设备，努力改善劳动组织，改善经营管理，提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，增加产品品种，降低产品成本，从而增加国家的、合作社的和个人的收入。俭，就是合理地节省地使用积累起来的资金，把每一文钱都用到最迫切需要的建设上去，而且要把一文钱当作二文用，用尽可能少的钱办尽可能多的事。勤和俭是不可分割的统一体。只俭不勤，就不能更多地增加积累，就不能又多、又快、又好、又省地进行建设；只勤不俭，把辛辛苦苦积累起来的钱随便乱花，当然也就不能又多、又快、又好、又省地进行建设。所以，勤和俭不仅是我们积累的办法，也是建设的办法。正因为这样，我们的党提出了勤俭建国的方针，指出铺张浪费是社会主义建设中的最危险的事情之一。所以，对于我们来说，开展反对浪费的斗争，绝不仅仅是为了几个钱的小问题，而是要不要社会主义的大问题。
    我们共产党从来就是提倡勤俭，反对铺张浪费的。早在二十四年前，毛泽东同志在江西瑞金召集的第二次全国工农代表大会上作的报告中就指出：“应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。”“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们会计制度的原则。”（毛泽东选集第一卷一二九页）。建国以来，我们的党和政府领导着全国人民不断地对各种浪费现象作斗争。其中规模较大的有1952年的三反运动和1955年的节约运动。在1956年农业合作化高潮到来以后，党又明确地提出了又多、又快、又好、又省的勤俭建国方针。几年来，这个方针的执行已经取得了很大的成绩。我国第一个五年计划已经超额完成，五年中基本建设的总投资超过了原计划4％以上，工业总产值在1957年已超过第一个五年计划原定指标的17％以上，农业和副业总产值在1957年也超过第一个五年计划原定指标的1％以上，文化教育和卫生事业也有很大发展。在厉行节约方面，仅1957年，第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、电机工业部根据我国具体情况，适当修改部分新建工厂的设计，就节约基本建设投资18％至25％，并增加了产品品种。在国营工业和地方工业中，出现了很多勤俭办企业的范例。
    即使这样，现在的节约潜力仍然很大。在工业建设中，有不少的同志，不区别重点企业和一般企业，不区别主要车间和辅助车间，不区别主要设备和辅助设备，一律追求高标准、机械化、自动化，使本来可以用较少的钱，在比较短的时间内建成的企业，不得不花较多的钱和较长的时间。根据许多调查，在保证工程质量的情况下，现在用六十元、七十元，或者八十元钱，就可以去办过去要用一百元钱才能办好的事情。在非生产性的建设中，许多地方还存在着建设项目过多，标准过高的现象。例如北京市城市规划管理局设计院，在这一次反浪费运动中，用革命的精神，采取边揭发，边检查、边改进的办法，在四天内修改了一百多项标准过高、盲目追求建筑形式的工程设计，就为国家节约了投资六百多万元。
    在工业生产、商业、交通运输等企业和手工业合作社中，材料积压，材料浪费，废品、次品过多，资金积压，经营环节过多，管理人员过多，仓库管理不善等等，也相当普遍。在材料积压方面，仅钢材一项，1957年全国企业的总库存数，超过了合理的生产周转量的三分之一左右。
    在不少的机关、部队、学校、医院和其它事业单位中，有许多事业费使用得不适当，节约的潜力也很大。有不少事业系统繁复，机构重叠，财务管理不善。有些具有公益事业性质的事业，本来是可以发动群众自办或自办公助的，但也统统由国家出钱举办了，而且有的标准很高。1958年国家计划支出的事业费达六十四亿元，如果适当地紧缩一些重复机构，减少人员，降低费用标准，那末，节约三、五亿元是完全可能的。
    在农业生产中，有些合作社在收入和积累增加以后，不首先用来扩大再生产，而用来进行办公室、俱乐部等非生产性的建设。这也是不符合于勤俭办合作社的方针的。
    上面讲的许多浪费现象，当然是很严重的，但跟我们建设的伟大成就比起来，最多也不过是十个手指中九个比一个。我们的成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的。我们建国不过九个年头，进行有计划的大规模的建设只有五年，由于缺乏经验，由于技术水平不高，还没有完全掌握建设和生产的规律，有些浪费是情有可原的，好比小孩子学走路时摔跤一样，是难免的。例如有些工厂建设的时候，由于对我国国情了解不够，把建筑标准和机械化、自动化的程度定得太高；有些工厂生产过程大致相同，相距又很近，有的只隔一堵围墙或一条马路，却没有按照协作原则建厂，每工厂都单独建设起工具、机修、木工等车间和化验室，结果多花了钱，设备利用率都很低。这些在建设初期，是难免的。但是，对于这类浪费，也必须加以纠正。因为小孩总是要长大的。我们已经有了第一个五年的建设经验，只要认真地总结过去的经验和教训，就可以提高对客观事物的认识，就可以把曾经是难免的事情变为可免的事情。
    但是，有许多浪费是由于工作人员的思想错误所造成的。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”有些同志办事情、想问题恰恰忘记了从六亿人口这一点出发，把圈子缩得小小的，只从自己一个单位出发。他们不论建什么工厂、学校、医院和其它非生产性的建筑，都要求“百年大计”，都要“求全”、“求新”、“求大”。不仅生产性建筑要全套的，非生产性的宿舍和福利建筑也要全套的；不仅房屋要大的，连绿化地区、道路也要大的；不仅主要的生产设备要国际标准的，连次要的设备和非生产性的用品也要国际标准的。这些同志的热情很高，孤立地来看，他们也的确办了一个好工厂，好学校，好医院。但他们却不了解，处处“全求”、“全大”、“全新”，样样“求全”、“求大”、“求新”，我们就不可能利用有限的资金，在比较短的时间内，建设更多的工厂、矿山、农田利用和学校、医院，就不能比较迅速满足六亿人民日益增长的物质生活和文化生活需要。
    还有一些企业、机关、学校、事业单位的领导人员不兢兢业业地对待自己的工作，或则高高在上，不深入基层，或则遇事不跟群众商量，不依靠群众，以感想代替党的政策，以臆测代替客观实际。这也是造成浪费的一个原因。
    不论是哪一种原因造成的错误，对又多、又快、又好、又省地进行社会主义建设都是不利的。因此，党中央要求每一个企业、机关、学校、医院和合作社，在整风运动中的整改阶段，开展一个反对浪费运动，发动群众，组织反浪费的专题鸣放和专题辩论，揭发各种浪费现象，分析浪费的原因，批判工作人员中的“求新”、“求全”、“求大”的不从全局考虑问题的思想，批判忽视政治的思想，批判领导人员的官僚主义和主观主义，找出从根本上杜绝浪费的办法。对于那些由于大规模的群众生产和建设运动中发生的浪费现象，也要揭发，也要纠正，但是必须从鼓励群众的革命干劲出发，不要泼冷水，不要挫伤群众的积极性。反对浪费，只是反掉那些超过目前国家经济水平的或者该节约而没有节约的开支，而绝不是把一些目前应该办而且可以办的事情搁着不办。反对浪费，只是反掉那些超过正常的生产建设所需要的原材料储备和消耗，而绝不是连必要的原材料也反掉，连产品质量也不顾。因此，对群众揭发出来的各种浪费现象，必须实事求是地进行分析，不能从这一极端走到另一极端，造成新的浪费。
    我们国家现在正面临着一个全国大跃进的新形势，工业建设和工业生产要大跃进，农业生产要大跃进，文教卫生事业也要大跃进。我们需要办很多事情。在这种新的形势下，开展一个群众性的反对浪费运动具有特别重要的意义。一方面可以通过反浪费的斗争，减少国家各项支出，增加收入，保证兴办更多事业的财政需要，另一方面，可以通过反浪费斗争，发扬中国人民艰苦奋斗的优良传统，培养勤俭的社会风尚。 1923年3月2日，列宁在“宁肯少些，但要好些”一文中，谈到厉行节约的意义时说：“只有这样，我们才能够——打个比喻说——从一匹马上跨到另一匹马上，就是说，从农民的、庄稼汉的、穷苦的马上，从指靠破产的农民国家实行节约的马上跨到无产阶级所寻求的而且不能不寻求的马上，跨到大机器工业、电气化、沃尔霍夫水电站等等的马上。”苏联人民遵循列宁的指示，在苏联共产党的领导下，仅仅用了三十多年的时间，就已经从穷苦的马上跨到了大机器工业、电气化的马上，并且开始跨上了原子的马上。苏联是我们的榜样。只要我们坚持勤俭建国的方针，在共产党的领导下，我们的国家一定很快地从现在这匹“又穷又白”的马上，跨到另一匹现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的又富又强的马上，飞跃地前进！
