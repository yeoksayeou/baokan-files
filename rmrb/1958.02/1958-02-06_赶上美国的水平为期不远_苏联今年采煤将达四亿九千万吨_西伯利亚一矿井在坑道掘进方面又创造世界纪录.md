　　Not Far From Catching Up with the U.S. Level
    Soviet Union's Coal Production to Reach 490 Million Tons This Year
    Siberian Mine Sets New World Record in Tunneling
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th. This year, the Soviet Union's total coal production will increase from last year's 463 million tons to nearly 490 million tons, an increase of 5.8%. This will enable the Soviet Union's total coal production to further approach or catch up with the level of the United States this year.
    Looking at the comparison of coal production between the Soviet Union and the United States in the past three years, it is possible to achieve this. For example, in 1955, the Soviet Union's coal production was 80% of that of the United States, 88% in 1956, and last year it reached 97% of that of the United States.
    This year, the production capacity of Soviet coal mines will continue to expand. The total production capacity of new coal mines and open-pit coal mines built and put into production in the Soviet Union last year reached more than 42 million tons. This year, the Soviet Union will have new coal mining enterprises with a total production capacity of 37.1 million tons built and put into production.
    This year, a number of new open-pit coal mines will be built in coal areas across the country, especially in the Urals, Kazakhstan, and the Kuzbass in Siberia, which will increase the proportion of coal mined using open-pit mining methods to nearly 19% of the total national coal production. Open-pit coal mining is much cheaper than mine mining.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 5th. TASS reported: The "North Polysaevsk" mine in the Kuznetsk coal region of Siberia, Soviet Union, set a world record in mechanized tunneling. In January of this year, the mine used a "ПКг—4" combined machine designed by Gumenik to tunnel 1,434 meters of tunnels, exceeding the original world record by 130 meters. The previous world tunneling record of 1,304 meters was created by the 22nd mine in the Moscow coal region last summer using the "ПК—2" combined machine.

### 赶上美国的水平为期不远  苏联今年采煤将达四亿九千万吨  西伯利亚一矿井在坑道掘进方面又创造世界纪录

　　赶上美国的水平为期不远
    苏联今年采煤将达四亿九千万吨
    西伯利亚一矿井在坑道掘进方面又创造世界纪录
    新华社莫斯科5日电　今年苏联的总采煤量将从去年的四亿六千三百万吨增加到将近四亿九千万吨，即增加5.8％。这将使得苏联的总采煤量在今年进一步接近或赶上美国的水平。
    从最近三年来苏美两国煤产量的对比情况来看，作到这一点是可能的。例如，在1955年，苏联采煤量为美国的80％，1956年为88％，而去年就已经达到美国的97％。
    今年，苏联煤矿的生产能力将继续扩大。苏联去年建成和投入生产的新煤井和露天煤矿的总生产能力达四千二百多万吨。今年，苏联又将有总生产能力达三千七百一十万吨的新的采煤企业建成和投入生产。
    今年，全国各煤区，特别是乌拉尔、哈萨克和西伯利亚的库兹巴斯将建成一批新的露天煤矿，这将使得使用露天开采方法开采的煤在全国总采煤量中所占的比重提高到将近19％。露天采煤的成本要比矿井采煤便宜得多。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联西伯利亚库兹?茨克煤区“北波雷萨耶夫斯克”矿井在矿井巷道机械化掘进方面创造了世界纪录。这个矿井在今年1月份采用古缅尼克设计的“ПКг—4”联合机，掘进了一千四百三十四公尺长的坑道，超过原有世界纪录一百三十公尺。上一个世界巷道掘进纪录一千三百零四公尺，是莫斯科煤区第二十二号矿井在去年夏天用“ПК—2”联合机创造的。
