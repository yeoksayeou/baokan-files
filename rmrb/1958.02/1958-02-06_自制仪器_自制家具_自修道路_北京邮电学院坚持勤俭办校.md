    Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications Persists in Running the School Diligently and Frugally

    This Newspaper reports that since its establishment in 1954, the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications has consistently emphasized the principles of diligence and frugality in running the school and practicing economy. Over the years, it has saved a considerable amount of construction funds for the country.

    During capital construction, the institute has always adhered to the principles of "practicality, economy, and aesthetics where conditions permit." On one occasion, it saved the state 800,000 yuan. By the end of 1957, the completed school buildings covered an area of 61,360 square meters, with an investment of 5.46 million yuan, resulting in an average comprehensive construction cost of approximately 89 yuan per square meter. Even the professional teaching and laboratory buildings did not exceed 80 yuan per square meter. Compared to several newly established universities in Beijing, its construction cost is relatively low. The planning and utilization of construction land is also relatively compact and economical.

    To save more state investment, under the active leadership of the institute's leaders, the entire faculty, staff, and students participated in the school's construction, combining it with labor training. They built roads and sports fields and leveled the ground themselves. The total value of the labor was approximately 4,690 yuan. This not only saved the state a sum of money but also cultivated the students' and teachers' labor habits.

    Regarding equipment, to address difficulties in market supply and achieve the goal of doing more with less money, the school has utilized and processed many instruments and equipment from enterprises' clearance of stagnant materials. To date, the total value of all equipment is 3.2 million yuan, comprising 17,875 pieces of instruments and equipment. In 1957, by adopting substitutions and internal transfers, the equipment budget expenditure was reduced by 125,000 yuan. The institute's various financial expenditures have been decreasing year by year. In 1957, it saved about 50% compared to 1956. Self-made furniture in 1957 saved about 30% compared to market prices. Particularly significant achievements have been made in conserving electricity and coal, with coal consumption in 1957 nearly 1,000 tons less than in 1956.

    Currently, the institute's Party committee is further studying measures to oppose waste and practice strict economy, based on the Ministry of Higher Education's directive on running schools diligently and frugally.

### 自制仪器　自制家具　自修道路  北京邮电学院坚持勤俭办校

　　自制仪器　自制家具　自修道路
    北京邮电学院坚持勤俭办校
    本报讯　北京邮电学院自1954年建校以来，就经常注意贯彻勤俭办学、厉行节约的方针。几年来为国家节省了不少的建设资金。
    该院在进行基本建设时，一直坚持了“适用、经济、条件许可下美观”的原则。一次就为国家节省了八十万元的资金。1957年年底，已经建成的校舍面积共六万一千三百六十平方公尺，投资五百四十六万元，综合造价平均每平方公尺约八十九元。就是各个专业教学实验大楼，也都没有超过八十元。这在北京市几个新建院校来说，建筑造价是比较低的一个学校。在规划建筑用地上也是比较紧凑节省的一个学校。
    为了更多地节省国家投资，在该院领导同志积极带头参加下，结合劳动锻炼，发动全校师生员工参加了建校工作。自己动手修筑道路、运动场地，平整场地。全部劳动约计价值四千六百九十元。这不仅为国家节省了一笔资金，也培养了师生的劳动习惯。
    在仪器设备方面，为了解决市场供应方面的困难和达到少花钱多办事的目的，学校曾从企业的清仓呆滞料中，利用和加工制造不少仪器设备。全校到目前为止，全部设备价值三百二十万元，共有仪器设备一万七千八百七十五件。1957年仪器设备由于采取代替，内部互调便节省了预算支出十二万五千元。该院各项财务开支逐年都在下降，1957年较1956年节省了约50％；自制家具1957年比市场价格节省约30％。特别在节约用电用煤方面成绩更为显著，其中用煤1957年比1956年几乎节省近千吨。
    现在学院党委正在根据高教部发出的勤俭办学指示，进一步研究反对浪费、厉行节约的措施。
