    Qaidam Spring Festival Brings Good News
    Well No. 1 in the Central-Deep Area Extracts Core Samples Saturated with Crude Oil
    Xinhua News Agency, Mang'ai, February 19th: On the first day of the Spring Festival, workers at Well No. 1 in the Central-Deep Area of the Mahai Exploration Area of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau in the Qaidam Basin struck an oil-bearing sand layer more than one meter thick at a depth of more than 490 meters, and the extracted core samples were saturated with crude oil. This good news gave the workers even greater confidence. The earthwork team No. 3, composed of more than 100 cadres who were sent to lower levels, overfulfilled the earthwork task by 2.5% on the day before the Spring Festival. The Mang'ai Transportation Brigade also broke with convention and accepted busy transportation tasks during the Spring Festival, driving all vehicles from the base to the exploration area, well sites, and Da Qaidan.
　  The Party organization of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau called on workers to demonstrate the spirit of "three years of hard struggle" and do two good deeds for the country during the three-day holiday.

    柴达木春节传喜讯
    中深一井取出饱含原油的岩芯
    据新华社茫崖19日电　春节的第一天，柴达木盆地青海石油勘探局马海探区的中深一井的职工，在四百九十多公尺深处打到了厚达一公尺多的含油砂层，取出的岩芯饱含原油。这个喜讯使职工们更加信心百倍。一百多个下放干部所组成的土方三分队，在春节的前一天超额2.5％完成了土方任务。芒崖运输大队也打破常规，在春节期间接受了繁忙的运输任务，把全部汽车由基地开往探区、井场和大柴旦。
　  中共青海石油勘探局党组织号召职工拿出“苦战三年”的精神，在三天假期里为国家做两件好事。
