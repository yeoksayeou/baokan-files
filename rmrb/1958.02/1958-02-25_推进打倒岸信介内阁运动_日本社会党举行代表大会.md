    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 24th: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo said today at the Socialist Party's 14th Congress that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet would eventually "fall into the pitiful fate of self-destruction" if it still failed to dissolve the Diet after deliberating the draft budget for 1958. The Socialist Party began its three-day congress in Tokyo this morning. At this third congress since the unification of the left and right factions around 1955, the Socialist Party will discuss and decide on the movement方針 for 1958 and current policies, prepare for the general election, and step up the implementation of the policy of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.
    Suzuki pointed out many signs that have indicated the increasing fragility of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet: the government's policies are fragmented; the government's financial policies force the working masses to endure the depression and poverty caused by fiscal austerity, while only providing additional protection to large monopoly capital enterprises; especially in foreign affairs, the government cannot even issue a declaration advocating the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, nor make efforts to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but wants to invest financial funds in the futile re-expansion of armaments.
    Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma pointed out in his party affairs report that struggles are currently underway against US military bases and Self-Defense Force bases, demanding the return of Okinawa, opposing atomic and hydrogen bombs, defending the constitution, restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and other national movements, carrying out the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.
    Asanuma also talked about some shortcomings of the Socialist Party in the struggles of 1957 in the report. He advocated that the Socialist Party should not be satisfied with Diet struggles alone in the future, but should launch joint struggles of workers, farmers, and small and medium-sized citizens in various regions.

### 推进打倒岸信介内阁运动  日本社会党举行代表大会

    推进打倒岸信介内阁运动
    日本社会党举行代表大会
    据新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎今天在社会党第十四次代表大会上说，岸信介内阁终于会“陷入自取灭亡的可悲的命运”，如果它在审议1958年度预算草案完毕以后仍然不能解散国会的话。社会党今天上午开始在东京举行为期三天的代表大会。社会党在这个自从1955年左右两派统一以来的第三次大会上，要讨论和决定1958年度运动方针和当前各项政策等问题，并且做好大选准备，加紧执行打倒岸信介内阁的方针。
    铃木指出了许多已经表明岸信介内阁日益脆弱的迹象：政府的政策是支离破碎的；政府的财经政策强使劳动群众忍受紧缩财政所造成的萧条和贫穷，而只是对垄断资本的大企业备加维护；特别是在外交方面，政府甚至不能发表宣言主张建立无核子武器地区，也不进行努力去缔结一项互不侵犯条约，却想把财政资金投到无益的重新扩充军备方面去。
    社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在他所作的党务报告中指出，目前正在热烈展开反对美军基地和自卫队基地的斗争，要求归还冲绳岛、反对原子弹和氢弹、保卫宪法、恢复日中邦交等国民运动，进行着推翻岸信介内阁的斗争。
    浅沼在报告中也谈到了社会党在1957年的斗争中的一些缺点。他主张，社会党今后不应该仅以国会斗争为满足，而应该展开各地区工人、农民、中小市民的联合斗争。
