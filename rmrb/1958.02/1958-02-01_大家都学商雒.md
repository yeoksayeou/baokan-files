　　Everyone Learn from Shangluo

    In Shangluo Special District, Shaanxi Province, every farmer's household in seven counties is planting walnuts. The time spent is short, and the results are significant. It is truly a mass movement. In a year or two, people walking through this area will see continuous rows of lush green small walnut trees on the mountains, hillsides, beside houses, and along roads. In seven or eight years, people will see local farmers receiving enormous incomes annually from these "money trees" and providing the state with a large amount of oil.

    The farmers of Shangluo Special District, under the leadership of the Party, have summoned such a magnificent force from the ground. Relying on this force, it will not take them long to raise the living standards of local farmers to a new level and to adorn those bare mountains and ridges with beauty!

    The method of Shangluo Special District is worth promoting. This method demonstrates the significant effects produced by combining the intentions of the leadership with the desires of the masses.

    All parts of the country can learn from the method of the Shangluo Prefectural Committee, put forward catchy slogans based on their respective natural conditions, historical conditions, and the desires of the masses, and mobilize the masses to plant various economic forests in large quantities—walnuts, Chinese prickly ash, tung trees, bananas, apples, oranges, and so on. At that time, how inspiring it will be for people to see the changes taking place on our vast land!

### 大家都学商雒

　　大家都学商雒
    陕西商雒专区七个县的农民每家都在种核桃，时间很短，效果很大，真是一个群众性的运动。一两年以后，人们走到这个地区，就会在山上山下、宅旁道旁看到连绵不断的绿油油的小核桃树；七、八年以后，人们又可以看到当地农户每年从这些“摇钱树”上得到巨大的收入，和它给国家提供的大量油料。
    商雒专区的农民在党的领导下从地下呼唤出了这样磅礴的力量。凭借这股力量，他们要不了多少时光就能把当地农民的生活水平提到一个新高度，并且把那些光山秃岭打扮得千娇百媚！
    商雒专区这个办法值得提倡。这个办法显示了领导意图和群众愿望相结合所产生的显著效果。
    全国各地都可以学习商雒地委的办法，根据各自的自然条件、历史条件和群众的愿望，提出响亮的口号，发动群众大量种植各种经济林——核桃，花椒，桐子，香蕉，苹果，柑桔，等等。到那时候，人们看到我国辽阔的土地上所发生的变化，将会多么振奋！
