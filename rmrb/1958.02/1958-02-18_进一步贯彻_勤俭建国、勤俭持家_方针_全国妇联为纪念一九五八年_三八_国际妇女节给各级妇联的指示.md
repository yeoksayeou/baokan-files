1958 is the year when the nationwide rectification movement achieves a complete victory, and industrial and agricultural production and various construction tasks make a comprehensive leap forward. Encouraged by the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little more, the broad masses of workers are actively striving to overfulfill the tasks of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan with high enthusiasm; the broad masses of farmers are striving to achieve a bumper harvest in 1958 and to realize the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule with active actions. 1958 is the year when the international situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" is even more significant. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has already surpassed and will further leave capitalist countries behind in the peaceful competition. The tide of Asian and African people striving for national independence will be even higher; the struggle of people all over the world for peace and against war will be carried out more extensively. Under this new situation, commemorating this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day has a more active and significant meaning.

In the past year, Chinese women have greatly improved their political consciousness after participating in the rectification, anti-rightist struggle, and socialist education movement. In participating in the socialist debate and the production and construction debate, they have further corrected their understanding of the fundamental systems and major policies of the country, such as the people's democratic dictatorship, the superiority of cooperation, the grain problem, unified purchase and sales, and urban commodity supply. They have distinguished between right and wrong and strengthened their confidence in continuing to advance on the socialist road. It has inspired the 300 million women across the country to bravely build the motherland, especially the vast number of rural women who, together with all farmers, have set off a high tide of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation with overwhelming force. The implementation of the resolution of the Third National Women's Congress, "Building the Country Through Thrift and Diligence, Managing the Household Through Thrift and Diligence, and Striving to Build Socialism," has played a role in promoting the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women in diligence and frugality and promoting the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production. Millions of active women who are diligent in production and thrifty in managing their households have emerged from cities and villages. Now the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan has begun. Look at five years in three, and three years in the first year. Taking advantage of this great time when the spring is full of gardens and the atmosphere is new, women's federations at all levels should actively lead women across the country to continue to participate in the nationwide rectification movement, improve their political consciousness, tap the huge labor potential hidden in the masses of women in all aspects, not be afraid of difficulties, work hard, and strive to overfulfill the 1958 national economic plan and further implement the policy of "Building the Country Through Thrift and Diligence, Managing the Household Through Thrift and Diligence."

To this end, when commemorating this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, we require women's federations at all levels to achieve the following:

(1) It is necessary to continue to improve women's socialist awareness, further mobilize women to actively participate in production labor, and promote a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in all aspects.

It is necessary to mobilize urban and rural women to continue to participate in the socialist education movement that is being carried out in depth, and guide women to pay more attention to the country's political life. By participating in the big blooming, big release, big debate, and assist grassroots political power organizations and agricultural production cooperatives and other production units to improve their work. Improve political awareness, strengthen women's collectivist thinking, overcome bourgeois individualism, promote the idea of labor glory, and correct the attitude towards labor. Guide women to actively invest in the industrial and agricultural production increase movement and various construction undertakings.

It is necessary to encourage female employees to highly display the spirit of diligence and frugality, conscientiously discuss the national plan and enterprise plan for 1958, actively participate in the production increase and economy movement and socialist competition. Study hard, delve into and improve technology, find tricks, tap potential, give play to initiative and creativity, the backward strive to catch up with the advanced, the advanced strive to be more advanced, and work together with male employees to jointly complete and strive to overfulfill the national 1958 plan for developing the national economy. Among the families of employees, we should continue to carry out the "Five Goods" centered on thrift and diligence in managing the household, and encourage and support husbands or fathers, brothers and children to actively engage in socialist construction.

It is necessary to encourage intellectual women, especially young women and female cadres, to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party and the government to participate in physical labor, engage in labor training, and transform their thinking. We must care about the families of employees, cadres, and military officers who return to their hometowns to engage in production, help them overcome difficulties, make them determined to live in the countryside for a long time, and set an example in the glorious cause of building a new countryside.

It is necessary to encourage rural women to actively participate in the discussion of local agricultural development plans, and use their own practical actions to realize the plan. Mobilize rural women, whether they are full laborers or semi-laborers, to actively work and participate in agricultural production and sideline production according to the needs of the cooperative. Give full play to the role of women's labor. It is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of women to collect feed in every possible way and vigorously develop the pig-raising industry; do a good job in household environmental sanitation and actively participate in the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests; strive to plant trees and afforest wasteland, barren mountains, and near houses, near villages, near roads, and near water. Women's federations at all levels should continue to encourage women's revolutionary spirit and strive to give full play to their strength in the great leap forward in agriculture. Women's federations should also pay attention to the labor protection of women and care about solving the problem of childcare. In organizing women to participate in production labor, special attention should be paid to mobilizing and helping women learn technology. So that women can play a greater role in promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production; with revolutionary spirit and production technology, we can completely overcome the backward state of production and realize the requirements of the agricultural development program to achieve an average annual output of 400, 500, and 800 catties per mu.

Women's federations at all levels should be good at closely combining political work with production movements, and constantly encourage and improve the fighting will of the masses of women. Once the enthusiasm of the masses is organized and brought into play, it will generate infinite power and create miracles in the industrial and agricultural production increase movement.

(2) While publicizing building the country through thrift and diligence, running cooperatives through thrift and diligence, and running all undertakings through thrift and diligence, set off a wave of publicity for managing the household through thrift and diligence. Lay the foundation for establishing a thrifty social atmosphere.

Promoting thrift and diligence in managing the household is an integral part of the content of the socialist education movement. In the socialist education movement, through blooming and debating, we must correctly understand the meaning and purpose of advocating thrift and diligence in managing the household and implement it in the overall production increase and economy movement.

It is necessary to comprehensively explain the relationship between thrift and diligence in managing the household and building the country through thrift and diligence, and running cooperatives through thrift and diligence. Make the masses understand that thrift and diligence in managing the household is an important supplement to the policy of building the country through thrift and diligence. Its purpose is to enable the people of the whole country to actively participate in production labor, develop industrial and agricultural production, and continue to increase people's income while implementing the policy of building the country through thrift and diligence, running cooperatives through thrift and diligence, and running all undertakings through thrift and diligence. To achieve thrift and diligence in managing the household, practice economy, and increase family savings, which will help increase the accumulation of collectives and the country, help further expand reproduction, and lay a more solid foundation for improving the lives of the people across the country. Doing so will also create more favorable conditions for accelerating the building of a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Therefore, implementing the policy of thrift and diligence in managing the household is not only to solve some temporary difficulties, nor is it a passive measure to restrict the improvement of people's lives, but is an active measure to develop production, oppose waste, and gradually improve people's lives.

In the publicity work of thrift and diligence in managing the household, we must repeatedly publicize the social significance of housework to the society. In socialist society, housework is an indispensable labor that promotes the development of social production and the survival and prosperity of the nation. Today, the good or bad arrangement of each family's life is not only related to the happiness of family members and the growth of future generations, but also affects the development of national production and the enthusiasm of people in socialism. Therefore, engaging in housework is also a contribution to socialist construction. Denying the value of housework, belittling housework, and belittling the ideas of housewives are all wrong ideas and must be eliminated.

It is necessary to advocate thrift in family life. Require every family member, especially women, to learn a set of skills and methods for managing the household diligently and thriftily. Everyone develops the habit of saving food, saving cotton cloth, and living a frugal life. In rural families, on the basis of doing a good job in unified purchase and sales, we must save grain and gradually store a portion of grain every year to prepare for famine years or emergencies. In family life, we must also oppose wasteful phenomena such as eating and drinking lavishly, holding large banquets, and entertaining guests, as well as bad habits such as gambling. For weddings and funerals, and social events, we should advocate striving for simplicity. Advocating thrift and opposing extravagance and waste is a struggle between new and old ideas. This is not only to save materials and increase accumulation, but also to change customs. Encourage people to break with conventions, overcome conservative ideas, promote vigor, increase ambition, and train our nation to become more enterprising. During the Spring Festival, we should pay more attention to publicizing the above points. And we can take this opportunity to guide the masses to plan and arrange the production and life of the whole year, and accumulate and reserve in a planned way. So that the Spring Festival and the life of the whole year can be spent happily, and lay the foundation for establishing a thrifty social atmosphere.

Women's federations at all levels should, from the Spring Festival to the "March 8th" Festival, focus on the central tasks of promoting the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production and the socialist publicity movement, and under the unified leadership of the local party committee, closely cooperate with people's organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League, as well as other relevant departments, mobilize all publicity forces and publicity tools, and jointly create social public opinion. And through cultivating and publicizing model figures and model collective models, establishing banners, and adopting various publicity methods, we will implement the spirit of thrift into family life. On the basis of the masses' voluntary and voluntary, the Women's Federation should further encourage and guide the masses to formulate family thrift plans or thrift covenants; and use methods such as organizing experience exchanges and selecting activists or models to check the implementation of thrift and diligence in managing the household, so that the work of publicity and promotion of thrift and diligence in managing the household will gradually become regularized.

When commemorating this year's "March 8th" Festival, we are facing two upsurges of nationwide rectification and production. The All-China Women's Federation and women's federations at all levels must continue to prevent and overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking that leadership lags behind reality on the basis of the achievements that have been made in rectification and rectification. Women's federations should, in accordance with the spirit of rectifying while correcting, actively assist the relevant parties to solve the opinions raised by the masses in the blooming on women's work; opinions that cannot be resolved temporarily and some erroneous opinions should also be clearly explained to the masses separately. All women's work cadres must, under the new situation, learn new working methods, firmly believe in the majority of the masses, learn to use the new working methods of the mass line of the masses' big blooming, big release, big debate, and continue to go deep into reality and the masses. The main cadres of women's federations at all levels must spend at least four months a year going down to the masses, often understanding and studying the demands and difficulties of the masses of women, and the newly emerging problems in women's work, discovering typical examples, cultivating and promoting typical examples, and timely guiding and promoting the overall development of women's work. Women's work cadres should participate in experimental fields, participate in labor training, and constantly improve their awareness and transform their thinking, especially rural women's work cadres should learn to go deep into production, learn production, and lead production. All cadres must establish a thrifty and diligent lifestyle, share weal and woe with the masses, carry forward the vigorous revolutionary vigor, drum up revolutionary enthusiasm, and work together with women across the country and the people of the whole country to strive for building socialism.

### 进一步贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”方针  全国妇联为纪念一九五八年“三八”国际妇女节给各级妇联的指示

    进一步贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”方针
    全国妇联为纪念一九五八年“三八”国际妇女节给各级妇联的指示
    1958年是全民整风运动获得彻底胜利，工农业生产及各项建设工作全面大跃进的一年。在中国共产党中央提出的争取十五年或者更多一点时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召鼓舞下，广大职工，正以高涨的热情，积极争取超额完成第二个五年计划第一年的任务；广大农民，正以积极的行动为争取1958年的大丰收，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而努力奋斗。1958年是国际上“东风压倒西风”的形势更其显著的一年。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在和平竞赛中，已经并且将进一步把资本主义国家丢在后面。亚非人民争取民族独立的浪潮将更加高涨；全世界人民争取和平，反对战争的斗争将更加广泛地开展起来。在这种新的形势下，纪念今年的“三八”国际妇女节，就有着更积极更重大的意义。
    过去一年中，我国妇女经过整风、反右派斗争和社会主义教育运动，政治觉悟已有很大的提高。她们在参加社会主义大辩论和生产建设大辩论中，对人民民主专政、合作化的优越性、粮食问题、统购统销、城市商品供应等国家的根本制度和重大政策，都进一步端正了认识，辨清了大是大非，坚定了在社会主义道路上继续前进的信心。鼓起了全国三亿妇女奋勇建设祖国的壮志，特别是广大的农村妇女和全体农民一起，以排山倒海之势，掀起了兴修水利和积肥运动的高潮。第三次全国妇女代表大会“勤俭建国，勤俭持家，为建设社会主义而奋斗”的决议的贯彻执行，对提高广大妇女群众勤劳节俭的积极性，促进工农业生产高潮，起了推动作用，千百万勤劳生产、勤俭持家的妇女积极分子从城市和乡村涌现出来。现在已经是第二个五年计划的第一年开始了。五年看三年，三年看头年。趁此春色满园、气象万新的大好时光，各级妇联组织要积极带动全国妇女继续参加全民整风运动，提高政治觉悟，从各方面挖掘蕴藏在妇女群众中的巨大劳动潜力，不怕困难，艰苦奋斗，为超额完成1958年的国民经济计划，进一步贯彻“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的方针而奋斗。
    为此，在今年纪念“三八”国际妇女节的时候，我们要求各级妇联作到以下几点：
    （一）要继续提高妇女的社会主义觉悟，进一步发动妇女积极参加生产劳动，从各个方面促进工农业生产大跃进。
    要动员城乡妇女继续参加正在深入开展的社会主义教育运动，引导妇女更加关心国家的政治生活。通过参加大鸣大放大争辩，协助基层政权组织和农业生产合作社等生产单位改进工作。提高政治觉悟，加强妇女的集体主义思想，克服资产阶级的个人主义，发扬劳动光荣的思想，端正劳动态度。引导妇女积极投入工农业增产运动和各项建设事业中去。
    要鼓励女职工高度地发挥勤劳节俭的精神，认真地讨论1958年的国家计划和企业计划，积极参加增产节约运动和社会主义竞赛。刻苦学习、钻研和提高技术，找窍门、挖潜力，发挥积极性和创造性，落后的争取赶上先进，先进的争取更先进，和男职工一起，共同努力完成和争取超额完成国家1958年发展国民经济的计划。在职工家属中应继续开展以勤俭持家为中心的“五好”，鼓励和支持丈夫或父兄子女积极从事社会主义建设。
    要鼓励知识妇女，尤其是女青年、女干部热烈响应党和政府关于参加体力劳动的号召，从事劳动锻炼，改造思想。要关心回乡生产的职工、干部和军官家属，帮助她们克服困难，使她们下决心长期生活在农村，并在建设新农村的光荣事业中，作出榜样。
    要鼓励农村妇女积极参加当地制定农业发展规划的讨论，并用自己的实际行动去实现规划。动员农村妇女，不论是全劳力，半劳力，都能根据合作社的需要和自己的能力积极出工，参加农业生产、副业生产。充分发挥妇女劳力的作用。要动员广大妇女千方百计的收集饲料，大力发展养猪事业；搞好家庭环境卫生，积极参加以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动；努力植树造林，绿化荒地荒山和宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁。各地妇联组织应当不断地鼓舞妇女的革命干劲，争取在农业大跃进中充分发挥力量。妇联组织也要注意对妇女的劳动保护，关心解决托儿问题。在组织妇女参加生产劳动中，要特别注意动员和帮助妇女学习技术。使妇女在促进工农业生产大跃进中发挥更大的作用；有了革命干劲，又有了生产技术，我们就完全能够克服生产上的落后状态，提前实现农业发展纲要提出的每亩平均年产量分别达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的要求。
    各级妇联组织要善于把政治工作和生产运动紧密结合进行，不断地鼓舞和提高妇女群众的战斗意志。群众的积极性一经组织和发挥起来，将会产生无穷无尽的力量，在工农业增产运动中创造奇迹。
    （二）在宣传勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的同时，掀起一个宣传勤俭持家的热潮。为树立勤俭的社会风尚打下基础。
    推行勤俭持家，是社会主义教育运动内容的组成部分，要在社会主义教育运动中通过鸣放争辩，正确地理解提倡勤俭持家的意义和目的，并在全面增产节约运动中贯彻执行。
    必须全面解释勤俭持家和勤俭建国、勤俭办社的关系。使群众懂得勤俭持家是勤俭建国方针的一个重要补充，它的目的是为了使全国人民在执行勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的方针，积极参加生产劳动，发展工农业生产，继续增加人民收入的同时，能够做到勤俭持家，厉行节约，增加家庭的积蓄，从而有利于增加集体和国家的积累，有利于进一步扩大再生产，为改善全国人民的生活奠定更坚实的基础。这样做，也就是为了加速建成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国创造了更有利的条件。因而贯彻执行勤俭持家方针，不只是为了解决暂时的某些困难，更不是为了限制人民生活改善的消极措施，而是积极的为了发展生产，反对浪费，逐步改善人民生活。
    在勤俭持家的宣传工作中，要反复向社会宣传家务劳动的社会意义。在社会主义社会中，家务劳动是促进社会生产的发展及民族生存和繁荣的不可缺少的一种劳动。今天每个家庭生活安排得好坏，不仅关系着家庭成员的幸福和子孙后代的成长，而且影响国家生产事业的发展和人们社会主义积极性的发挥。因此从事家务劳动，也就是对社会主义建设所作的一种贡献。否认家务劳动的价值，轻视家务劳动和轻视家庭妇女的思想，都是错误的思想，必须加以清除。
    要在家庭生活中提倡节约。要求每个家庭成员，特别是妇女们，都能学会勤俭理家的一套技术和办法。个个养成节约粮食、节省棉布、俭朴过日子的生活习惯。在农村家庭中，更要在做好统购统销工作的基础上，通过节约用粮的办法，做到每年逐步地储备一部分粮食，以备荒年或不时之需。在家庭生活中，还要反对大吃大喝、大摆宴席、大请客等浪费现象以及赌博等恶习。对红白喜事，人情应酬，要提倡力求简朴。提倡节约，反对铺张浪费是新旧思想的一种斗争。这不仅是为了节约物资，增加积累，而且是移风易俗。鼓舞人们打破陈规，克服保守思想，发扬朝气，增长志气，锻炼我们的民族，达到更加奋发有为。春节期间，对以上几点更要注意宣传。并可趁此时机引导群众计划和安排全年的生产和生活，有计划地进行积累和储备。使春节以及全年的生活都能过得心情舒畅，并为树立勤俭的社会风尚打下基础。
    各级妇联应在春节到“三八”节时，围绕促进工农业生产高潮及社会主义宣传运动的中心任务，在当地党委的统一领导下，同工会、共青团等人民团体以及其他有关部门密切配合，动员一切宣传力量和宣传工具，共同兴起社会舆论。并通过培养和宣传模范人物和模范的集体典型、树立旗帜和采取各种各样的宣传方法，把勤俭精神贯串到家庭生活中去。妇联要在群众自觉自愿的基础上，进一步鼓励和引导群众制订家庭勤俭计划或勤俭公约；并以组织经验交流及评选积极分子或模范等办法，检查勤俭持家的执行情况，使宣传和推行勤俭持家的工作，逐步转入经常化。
    在纪念今年“三八”节的时候，我们面临着全民整风和生产两个高潮，全国妇联和各级妇联必须在整风、整改已获得成就的基础上，继续防止和克服领导落后于实际的右倾保守思想。妇联组织应当根据边整边改精神，对群众在鸣放中提出的有关妇女工作方面的意见，积极协助有关方面加以解决；暂时不能解决的以及部分错误的意见，也要分别向群众交代清楚。全体妇女工作干部，要在新形势下，学会新的工作方法，坚定地相信群众的多数，学会运用群众大鸣大放大争大辩的群众路线的新的工作方法，继续深入实际、深入群众。各级妇联主要干部，每年至少要以四个月的时间下去在群众中，经常了解研究妇女群众的要求、困难，和妇女工作中新出现的问题，发现典型，培养和推广典型，及时指导推动妇女工作的全面开展。妇女工作干部，要参加搞试验田，参加劳动锻炼，不断提高觉悟，改造思想，特别是农村妇女工作干部要学会深入生产、学习生产、领导生产。全体干部要树立勤劳节俭的生活作风，同群众共甘苦，发扬蓬勃的革命朝气，鼓起革命干劲，与全国妇女、全国人民一道，共同为建设社会主义而努力奋斗。
