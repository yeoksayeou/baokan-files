Notes

    It's not that they don't want to, but they really can't.
    When boasting about America's artificial satellite, U.S. Vice President Nixon mentioned this point: "The orbits of both Soviet artificial satellites pass over the United States, while the orbit of the first American satellite does not pass over any part of the Soviet Union." The implication is that the United States deliberately did this to avoid even entering the outer space above Soviet territory.
    This is quite ridiculous. If, as Nixon claims, the American "Explorer" is a "peaceful satellite," a tool for scientific research rather than for reconnaissance and military espionage, no country would object to it passing through its outer space. Anyone with a little scientific knowledge knows that due to the limitations of American rocket technology, the orbital plane of American artificial satellites can only form a 35-degree angle with the equator, and therefore the areas that can be reached are limited to the region between 35 degrees north latitude and 35 degrees south latitude. The reason why American artificial satellites cannot pass over the Soviet Union is not that they don't want to, but that they really can't. What's Nixon trying to pretend!

    非不为也，实不能也
    美国副总统尼克松在为美国的人造卫星吹嘘时说到这样一点：苏联两个人造卫星的“轨道都经过美国上空，而美国的第一个卫星的轨道并不经过苏联任何部分的上空。”言下之意，美国是故意这样做以避免甚至进入苏联领土上的外层空间似的。
    这未免太可笑了。如果真如尼克松所说的美国的“探险者”是一个“和平的卫星”，是科学研究的工具而不是进行侦察和军事谍报勾当的工具，任何国家都不会反对它经过自己的外层空间的。而只要稍有一点科学常识的人都知道，美国由于火箭技术水平所限，人造卫星的轨道平面只能与赤道成35度，因而可以达到的地区就只限于北纬35度到南纬35度之间的范围。美国人造卫星不能经过苏联的上空，非不为也，实不能也。尼克松装什么蒜！
