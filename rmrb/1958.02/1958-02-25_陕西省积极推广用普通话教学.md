Shaanxi Province Actively Promotes Mandarin Instruction

    (Report from our newspaper) Under the guidance of the central government's policy of "大力提倡，重点推行，逐步普及" (vigorously advocating, focusing on promotion, and gradually popularizing), Shaanxi Province has achieved great success in promoting Mandarin Chinese over the past two years. A total of 35,906 primary school teachers have been trained, accounting for 70% of the total number of primary school teachers; 800 middle school Chinese language teachers have learned the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet, accounting for 50% of all middle school Chinese language teachers. This has laid a good foundation for carrying out Mandarin instruction in schools.

    In order to improve teachers' knowledge of phonetics, consolidate their learning achievements, exchange experiences, and expand social publicity, the Shaanxi Provincial Mandarin Promotion Working Committee held two sessions of "Mandarin Phonetics Teaching Broadcast Lectures," which were listened to by approximately 20,000 people. It also held two sessions of "Mandarin Phonetics Spare Time Learning Classes" for cadres of various agencies in Xi'an, training 100 students. In 1956, the Mandarin Promotion Working Committee and the Provincial Education Trade Union conducted propaganda reports on language reform, promotion of Mandarin, and standardization of the Chinese language in Xi'an, Chang'an, Weinan, and other places. At present, Shaanxi Province has published seven kinds of books for learning Mandarin, such as "Explanation of Mandarin Problems" and "Introduction to Mandarin," with a circulation of more than 130,000 copies. Regarding the general survey of modern Chinese dialects, the dialect survey team organized by Northwest University, Xi'an Normal College, and the Department of Education has now completed 83% of the survey tasks and is striving to basically complete them by March of this year.

    At present, all levels of schools are teaching Hanyu Pinyin alphabets (or Zhuyin alphabets) in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's "Instructions on Promoting Mandarin Chinese" in an effort to improve the quality of Mandarin instruction. The Shaanxi Provincial Mandarin Promotion Working Committee plans to train some phonetics teachers for government agencies and the military in a planned and step-by-step manner, and to promote the Draft Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin Chinese in government agencies, organizations, and the military.

    陕西省积极推广用普通话教学
    本报讯　陕西省推广普通话工作，两年来在中央提出的“大力提倡，重点推行，逐步普及”的方针指导下，取得了很大的成绩。共训练了小学教师三万五千九百零六人，占小学教师总数的70％；中等学校语文教师有八百人，学会了汉语拼音字母，占全部中等学校语文教师的50％。这为在学校里开展用普通话教学，打下了良好的基础。
    陕西省推广普通话工作委员会为了提高教师语音知识水平，巩固学习成绩，交流经验和扩大社会宣传，举办了两期“普通话语音教学广播讲座”，约有两万多人进行了收听，还为在西安的各机关干部举办了两期“普通话语音业余学习班”，训练了一百名学员。推广普通话工作委员会在1956年和省教育工会在西安、长安、渭南等地进行了文字改革、推广普通话和汉语规范化的宣传报告。目前陕西省已出版“普通话问题解说”、“普通话入门”等七种学习普通话的书籍，发行十三万册以上。关于现代汉语方言的普查工作，由西北大学、西安师范学院和教育厅等组织的方言普查工作队，现在已完成83％的调查任务，争取在今年3月基本完成。
    目前，各级学校都根据国务院“关于推广普通话的指示”精神，教学汉语拼音字母（或注音字母），为提高普通话教学质量而努力。陕西省推广普通话工作委员会准备有计划有步骤地为机关、部队训练一些语音教师，在机关、团体和部队中推行汉语拼音方案草案和普通话。　（李平）
