Comrades and friends!

I now declare the rally of the capital of the People's Republic of China celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army open. First, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and all the people of China, allow me to extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to the great Soviet people and the heroic Soviet Army.

The Soviet Army was born in the flames of the great October Socialist Revolution. It is an army founded and educated by the proletarian revolutionary teachers Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is the world's first army of workers and peasants. Over the past forty years, the Soviet Army has traversed an extremely glorious path. It shattered the imperialist armed intervention against the Soviet Union and defended the fruits of the October Revolution. In the anti-fascist Second World War, it was the main force in annihilating the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist armies, not only defending the great Soviet Union but also liberating the people of many countries in Europe and Asia who were enslaved by fascism, saving world civilization from fascist devastation. The glorious history of the Soviet Army proves that it is a powerful and reliable defender of the socialist cause and the cause of peace and democracy.

In the Chinese people's liberation struggle, at the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Army's attack on the Japanese invading army played an extremely significant role in the final defeat of Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people will never forget the Soviet Army's great internationalist friendship with the Chinese people.

Now, the world situation has undergone tremendous changes, and it is an era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. The era in which imperialists acted arbitrarily and did whatever they wanted is gone forever. And the powerful Soviet Army is an important factor in defending world peace and preventing imperialist reckless actions. In today's situation, as long as we strengthen the unity of the two major powers, China and the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, and remain vigilant at all times, the imperialist war conspiracies are bound to continue to fail, and will eventually go bankrupt. The cause of world peace and human progress will surely achieve universal victory!

Long live the heroic Soviet Army!

Long live the friendly unity of the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    在首都庆祝苏军建军四十周年大会上
    林伯渠致开幕词亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    现在我宣布中华人民共和国首都庆祝苏军建军四十周年的大会开幕。首先，让我代表中国人民解放军的全体官兵、中苏友好协会的全体会员和全中国人民，向伟大的苏联人民、向英雄的苏联军队表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    苏联军队是在伟大的十月社会主义革命的烈火中诞生的，是无产阶级革命导师列宁和苏联共产党所创立与教育的军队，是全世界第一支工农劳动人民的军队。四十年来，苏联军队走过了极为光荣的道路，它粉碎了帝国主义对苏联的武装干涉，捍卫了十月革命的成果；在反对法西斯的第二次世界大战中，它是歼灭德意日法西斯军队的主力军，不但保卫了伟大的苏联，而且解放了欧洲、亚洲许多受法西斯奴役的国家的人民，使世界文明免受法西斯的摧残。苏联军队的光辉历史证明，它是社会主义事业与和平民主事业的强大的可靠的捍卫者。
    在中国人民所进行的解放斗争中，在抗日战争的末期，苏军给予日本侵略军的打击，在最后打败日本帝国主义上面起了极其重大的作用。中国人民永远不会忘记苏军对中国人民的伟大的国际主义的友谊。
    现在，世界形势已经起了巨大的变化，已是东风压倒西风的时代。帝国主义者横行霸道为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。而威力强大的苏军正是保卫世界和平、制止帝国主义轻举妄动的重要因素。在今天的形势下，只要我们加强中苏两大国的团结、加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、加强全世界爱好和平的国家与人民的团结，时刻保持警惕，帝国主义的战争阴谋就一定要继续失败，最后一定会破产，世界和平和人类进步的事业必将获得普遍的胜利！
    英雄的苏联军队万岁！
    中苏两国人民及其军队的友好团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
