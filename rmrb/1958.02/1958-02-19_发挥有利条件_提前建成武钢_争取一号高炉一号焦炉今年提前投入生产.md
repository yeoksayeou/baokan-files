Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 18th—According to the Changjiang Daily, Han Ningfu, Deputy General Manager of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, said at the plenary (enlarged) meeting of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 12th that, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Communist Party of China recently revised the construction plan indicators for this year, deciding to increase the total investment by 10% compared with the original plan, to ensure that No. 1 blast furnace is put into production ahead of schedule on October 1st this year, and No. 1 coke oven is put into production ahead of schedule on September 1st. Other projects are also required to be completed ahead of schedule accordingly.

Han Ningfu said that the overall planning of the Wuhan Steel Plant stipulates that No. 1 blast furnace was originally scheduled to be put into production at the end of the first quarter of 1959. At the beginning of last year, according to the national pig iron balance needs, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company determined to complete and put No. 1 blast furnace into production ahead of schedule by the end of this year, and No. 1 coke oven ahead of schedule on October 1st. Now, under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, in order to give play to revolutionary enthusiasm, and to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, the plan is revised again.

Han Ningfu said that completing the construction project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company this year is a very glorious and arduous task. Wuhan Iron and Steel Company is the main force for the growth of steel production in my country's Second Five-Year Plan. Completing the Wuhan Steel Plant ahead of schedule can accelerate the development of the steel industry. The pig iron produced by No. 1 blast furnace one day ahead of schedule can manufacture 100,000 double-wheeled, double-shared plows. Therefore, we must do everything possible to strive to complete the construction of No. 1 blast furnace and produce iron on National Day this year.

Han Ningfu said that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has listed the construction project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company as the first priority in the construction of the black metallurgical industry this year. And made several decisions to accelerate the construction project of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company.

Han Ningfu said that according to the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry requires Wuhan Iron and Steel Company to save 10 million yuan in investment this year. Han Ningfu finally said: The favorable conditions now are that the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has received the attention and support of the central government and various factories and mines, as well as the help of Soviet experts. However, there are still certain difficulties in equipment, design, materials, and labor, especially in equipment, which are very difficult. Relevant departments in various provinces and cities and relevant factories in various places are required to give strong support.

### 发挥有利条件　提前建成武钢  争取一号高炉一号焦炉今年提前投入生产

    发挥有利条件　提前建成武钢
    争取一号高炉一号焦炉今年提前投入生产
    新华社武汉18日电　据长江日报报道，武汉钢铁公司副总经理韩宁夫12日在中共武汉钢铁公司委员会全体委员（扩大）会议上说，根据冶金工业部的指示，中共武汉钢铁公司委员会最近重新修订了今年的建设计划指标，决定总投资额比原计划增加10％，保证一号高炉提前到今年10月1日投入生产，一号焦炉提前到9月1日投入生产。其他工程也都要求相应地提前。
    韩宁夫说，武钢建厂总规划规定，一号高炉原定在1959年一季度末投入生产。去年年初，根据国家生铁平衡需要，冶金工业部和武钢确定把一号高炉提前到今年年底建成并投入生产，一号焦炉提前到10月1日投入生产。现在武钢在全国大跃进的形势下，为了发挥革命干劲，和响应党中央提出的在十五年或者更多一点时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召，再度修订计划。
    韩宁夫说，完成今年武钢的建设工程是一个十分光荣而又艰巨的任务。武钢是我国第二个五年计划钢铁产量增长的主力，提前建成武钢就能加快钢铁工业的发展。一号高炉提前一天投入生产所产的生铁，就能制造十万部双轮双铧犁。因此，必须想尽一切办法，力争在今年国庆节把一号高炉建成出铁。
    韩宁夫说，冶金工业部已把武钢建设工程列为今年黑色冶金工业建设的第一位。并且作出了几项决定，以便加速武钢建设工程。
    韩宁夫说，根据勤俭建国的原则，冶金工业部要求武钢今年节约投资一千万元。韩宁夫最后说：现在有利的条件是，武钢建设得到中央和各厂矿的重视和支持，以及苏联专家的帮助。但是，在设备、设计、材料、劳动力等方面还存在一定的困难，特别是设备问题困难很多，要求各省市有关部门和各地有关工厂大力支持。
