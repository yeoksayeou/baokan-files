A wealthy, civilized, and beautiful new socialist countryside.
Representative Li Hui reports on the model deeds of Taiyang Village in eliminating the "four pests" and promoting production.

I wholeheartedly support all the reports of the conference and will resolutely implement them. Here, I would like to report to the conference on the model deeds of Taiyang Village in eliminating the "four pests" and promoting hygiene.

After six years of hard work, the "four pests" were eliminated ten years ahead of schedule, and the poor and dirty "plague village" became a new village with healthy people and livestock and abundant harvests.

Taiyang Village is a village in Jishan County, Jinan Prefecture, Shanxi Province. The village has a total of 218 households with 913 people. In the past, this village was a backward village that was poor, dirty, plagued by diseases, and avoided by relatives and visitors. Needless to say, the four pests were rampant, and every household was sour, smelly, and dark, with bedbugs, lice, and fleas in abundance. Moreover, people had particularly bad habits of defecating everywhere, piling up garbage, and dumping dirty water. However, since 1952, starting with the opposition to the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, after six years of hard work, the "four pests" have been eliminated ten years ahead of schedule. A dirty and poor "plague village" has been transformed into a new socialist countryside with healthy people and livestock, abundant harvests, and a civilized and happy life for the people. In the past two years, more than 40,000 people from both inside and outside the province have visited this village. I have also been there twice. Everyone who visited Taiyang Village had a common feeling—spirit lifted, mood soothed. Some people were deeply moved after the visit and said that before the visit, they suspected that the newspaper reports were somewhat exaggerated. After the visit, their impression was: on the contrary, the newspaper reports were not exaggerated, but quite inadequate. Here, the streets are as smooth and clean as roads in the city. The streets and alleys are swept clean, and along both sides of the roads, there is a public toilet and a brick-built garbage can every so often. Here, the toilet pits have covers, and disinfectant is sprinkled in the pits. There are no sewage pits in or around the village, and there is simply no place for flies and mosquitoes to breed. Sparrows and rats have all been eradicated. Not long ago, there was such an interesting incident: a reporter visited Taiyang Village and saw a small bird flying in the air. He told the village cadre that there were still sparrows here. The village cadre affirmed that there were none. Later, a sharpshooter in the village shot down the small bird that the reporter saw. It turned out to be a goldfinch. Here, cattle and horses have sheds, chickens and pigs have pens, and firewood and grass have yards. Even in the livestock pens, there is no smell. All the walls are whitewashed, and the walls are painted with educational murals such as developing production, loving peace, studying culture, eliminating the "four pests," and promoting hygiene. What is particularly admirable is that on all the snow-white walls and the walls of public toilets in the village, no one has drawn a single black line in the past three years. Although this is a small matter, it can show how much the people of Taiyang Village cherish the cleanliness of public places. Here, flowers, plants, and trees have been planted beside houses, roads, and villages, and in farmers' yards since 1956. When spring comes and flowers bloom, you can see beautiful scenery. Here, every house has clean windows and bright rooms, and there is no dust on the stoves, tables, benches, and cabinets. Bowls, chopsticks, and cooking utensils are placed in kitchen cabinets covered with white gauze. The whole village is disinfected indoors regularly, and every household has a spittoon. The bad habit of spitting everywhere that people had for thousands of years has been broken. Here, paying attention to personal hygiene has also begun to form a new custom. Everyone gets up early every day to wash their face and clean the inside and outside of the house. Eighty percent of the young and middle-aged people have begun to have the habit of brushing their teeth. Neat clothes, washing hands before meals, trimming nails, wearing masks when going out, and women using sanitary belts during menstruation have all become common practices.

The results of the health and hygiene work in Taiyang Village have been tested by facts. In the spring of 1957, when influenza was spreading in Jishan County, many people in neighboring villages were infected, but it could not invade Taiyang Village. At that time, Zhang Lesan, a cadre of the County Public Security Bureau, caught a cold and returned home. His wife reported to the health station and asked him to wear a mask and advised him to return to the county town for treatment immediately. He returned to the city the next day. Primary school student Liu Mudan contracted a slight cold at her grandmother's house. After returning to the village, she asked her father to report to the health station. At the same time, in order to avoid infecting other classmates, she asked for leave from school. Old lady Liu Ernv went to her daughter's house in Dongwei Village to take care of her daughter after she gave birth. She saw that her daughter's house was very dirty and could not eat, so she ran back to her own house to get steamed buns to eat. Her daughter was stimulated and educated by her and also began to pay attention to hygiene. The actions of this old lady seem a little abnormal, but they are indeed facts.

All of the above is vastly different from the situation six years ago. Therefore, the people of this village said: "It is the same Taiyang Village, but it is like two different places." "The past Taiyang Village had no sun. Thank the Communist Party for giving us the sun. Now it is a real Taiyang Village."

Taiyang Village marched towards the "four pests" three times. The masses displayed tenacious energy and infinite wisdom. The "four pests" were eliminated, manure was accumulated, and production was increased.

The change in the appearance of Taiyang Village was not smooth sailing. Under the strong leadership of the Party, by implementing the policy of combining health and hygiene work with production, and by constantly mobilizing the masses to wage arduous struggles against traditional unsanitary customs, victory was finally achieved. Obviously, the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests is essentially a social reform movement to change customs and habits. The facts in Taiyang Village tell us that we must not underestimate the political significance of this movement.

When the patriotic health campaign was launched in various places in 1952 to oppose the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, the general public was resistant to hygiene, and Taiyang Village was no exception. At that time, people in Taiyang Village said: "Poor people are clean, rich people are sloppy, and whoever pays attention to hygiene will have bad luck." But facts have proved that it is not paying attention to hygiene that brings bad luck, but not paying attention to hygiene that brings bad luck. There is such an example: Farmer Zhang Yinhe's two children contracted measles. The village cadre advised him to clean up his house, not to let the children go out, and to ask a doctor to see them. He did not listen to the cadre and said: "It is better to kowtow to the gods than to spend money on medical treatment." As a result, his two children were cured to death by witches. The other children in the village who had measles recovered their health after being treated by doctors. In the spring of 1952, this village also had a serious infectious disease among adults; 62 people were infected, and most of them were rescued after being treated urgently by doctors sent by the county, and seven people died. The Party branch seized these examples to educate the masses, mobilizing the masses to talk about the suffering caused by unsanitary conditions to life and property losses, and publicized scientific health knowledge. In this way, some of the masses began to realize the truth that "it is better to seek medical treatment than to pray to gods, and it is better to prevent epidemics than to seek medical treatment." Immediately afterwards, the Party branch put forward the slogan "Carry out the patriotic health campaign, strong people and horses, and guarantee the development of production," "Everyone should take action to achieve four cleanliness and five destructions." First of all, it organized the masses to eliminate the most serious lice, bedbugs, fleas, flies, and mosquitoes that endanger human health, and also began to catch rats. After more than a year of efforts, the environmental sanitation in the village has been initially improved, and infectious diseases have been greatly reduced. From 1953 to 1955, only one person suffered from infectious diseases.

However, due to the relaxation of leadership by the Party branch, the mass health movement once declined in 1955. At that time, some people said: "Paying attention to hygiene is only for beauty. It does not solve practical problems and delays production." Some women said: "You can't pay attention to hygiene if you have too many children," "You can pay attention to hygiene if you raise chickens and pigs at home." Many health group leaders were also unwilling to do it, and health work was almost at a standstill. At this time, under the supervision of the county party committee, the Party branch reorganized and reversed the situation. First of all, it focused on educating activists such as Communist Youth League members, primary school teachers, and students who were more enthusiastic about health work. It organized local Chinese and Western doctors to add health courses to agricultural technology night schools, people's schools, and primary schools. It also held lectures on maternal and child health and lectures on common sense of livestock raising. In this way, a group of activists who had political enthusiasm, understood scientific knowledge, and could take the lead in paying attention to hygiene emerged. Then, relying on them, it carried out in-depth patriotic health publicity work among the masses. They used many lively and vivid publicity methods such as exhibitions, plays, fast talks, drum words, blackboard newspapers, and slogans to carry out publicity at any time and place in response to the ideological trends of the masses. Secondly, the Party branch also mobilized the masses to carry out patriotic health competitions. It adopted the method of grasping both ends to drive the middle, and regularly carried out inspection and evaluation work. Taking the production team of the agricultural cooperative as a unit, Taiyang Village was divided into four sanitary areas. Competition campaigns were widely carried out between sanitary areas, between households, and between people. In the beginning of the competition, after each inspection and evaluation, they would put up a note with the words "The Cleanest Household" on the door of the advanced household. For the backward households, they would put up a note with the words "The Dirtiest Household" on their doors. This did not only fail to prompt the backward to learn from the advanced, but also aroused their serious resentment, and some people even openly resisted inspecting household sanitation. Later, they changed their approach. The degree of household cleanliness was divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Moreover, they would praise the households in Grade C as soon as they made progress. In this way, the masses' collective heroism was inspired. The slogan of comparing with the advanced and learning from the advanced became the conscious action of the masses. By the end of last year, there were no Grade C households in the village. Special-grade households and Grade A households accounted for two-thirds, and Grade B households accounted for only one-third. Thirdly, in order to cultivate a new way of life for farmers, the Party branch also mobilized the masses to formulate patriotic health covenants and food hygiene rules. The health station trained the housewives in the village in accordance with the food hygiene rules, so that they developed the habit of washing hands before and after cooking, trimming their nails frequently, washing cooking utensils with clean water regularly, and cooking on time, so that every meal was both economical in grain, hygienic, and delicious.

Through the above work, the thinking and living habits of the masses have undergone significant changes. By 1956, on the basis of realizing advanced cooperativization in the village, especially after the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the patriotic health campaign in Taiyang Village made a leap forward. According to the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program to eliminate the "four pests," the Party branch issued a battle call to all men, women, old and young in the village to completely eliminate the "four pests." It also loudly put forward the slogan "Eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, strong soldiers and horses, accumulate more fertilizer, and produce more grain." It also used examples to calculate the harm caused by flies, mosquitoes, sparrows, and rats, and stimulated the masses' hatred for the four pests. Thus, a large-scale battle to encircle and suppress the "four pests" was launched. After this battle, the remaining flies and mosquitoes were completely eliminated, and rats and sparrows were basically eliminated as well. In this patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "four pests," combined with improving environmental sanitation, the masses created 29 methods of accumulating fertilizer. All dust, dirt at the base of walls, dirt on kang beds, soot, dust on roofs, rust on thatch, etc., were cleared and used as fertilizer. In this way, before the summer of 1956, the wheat fields were able to be top-dressed twice that year, and the average yield per mu reached 202 jin, an increase of 65.6% compared with 1955.

At the same time, livestock health care work was vigorously carried out. Livestock were raised to achieve six cleanlinesses, namely, clean water, clean grass, clean feed, clean troughs, clean livestock bodies, and clean pens; three no-sees, namely, no manure in the pens (dry soil should be padded at any time), no residue in the troughs, and no dust in the sheds. In 1953, due to poor livestock raising, 12 heads died in the village. In 1956, not only did no head die, no head rested due to illness, but also 23 heads of young livestock were bred. After completing the above work, the Party branch led the masses to carry out environmental beautification work, mobilizing the masses to plant trees and flowers in the courtyards and streets, move toilets outside the courtyards, renovate garbage cans, and add various sanitary equipment. At this time, paying attention to hygiene by all men, women, old and young in the village had become institutionalized and regularized. At the Provincial Congress of Socialist Activists in 1956, Taiyang Village was awarded the honorary title of Model Sanitary Village.

In September 1957, Chairman Mao put forward the great call to turn China into a "four-without" country at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call, in October, a provincial rural health care work conference centered on eliminating the "four pests" was held in Jishan County. All participants visited Taiyang Village. Promoting the experience of Taiyang Village was the central topic of this conference. The people of Taiyang Village were not complacent because of this. Under the leadership of the Party branch, they once again checked the work of eliminating the "four pests" and found that there were still some residual rats and sparrows. Everyone naturally felt that this was incompatible with the honorary title of "Model Sanitary Village." Therefore, a mopping-up battle against rats and sparrows was launched. However, the remaining rats and sparrows became more and more cunning, and it was impossible to solve the problem with only one method. The masses created dozens of methods to eliminate rats and sparrows in response to their activity patterns. Here, the commando team composed of young people played an outstanding role. After two months of fighting, Taiyang Village finally became a "four-without" village. According to statistics, in the past six years, the village has eliminated a total of 244 jin of flies, 15,742 rats, and 2,018 sparrows. Dug up 29 jin of pupae.

The experience of Taiyang Village tells us that as long as everyone fully recognizes the harm of flies, mosquitoes, sparrows, and rats, and thus highly hates them, then everyone will generate a tenacious energy and infinite wisdom. The time required to completely eliminate the "four pests" can be greatly shortened. Taiyang Village marched towards the "four pests" three times, but in fact, it only took three years. It is estimated that in the future, in other places, it will only take one or two years if it is done well.

The staff of the health station went deep into homes and fields to carry out health care work, which played a great role in promoting the development of the health movement and consolidating the results of the movement.

It should be especially mentioned that in the patriotic health movement in Taiyang Village, the township health station (with a branch station in Taiyang Village) played a lever role in mobilizing and educating the masses, promoting the development of the movement, and consolidating the results of the movement. With the realization of advanced cooperativization, the originally privately-run joint clinics also transformed into socialist health stations. In the past two years, under the leadership and support of the Party branch, the health station has implemented the policy of running the station diligently and thriftily, focusing on prevention, serving production, and serving the members. It has promoted the labor protection system in agricultural cooperatives and established a health work network. Each production team has a health room and a midwifery group. Doctors and health workers often combine medical work and go deep into the members' families and fields to carry out health care work. Doctors regularly examine the members, and the production team reasonably assigns work according to the members' health status, physical condition, and labor ability according to the examination results. Agricultural cooperatives and health stations are particularly concerned about women's health. Each production team implements a menstruation sign-up system for women. Production teams allow women on their period to take leave or only assign them light work. At first, many young women were shy and unwilling to let people know that they had their period. Later, because they experienced the benefits of this system, they would automatically go to the health room to sign up whenever they had their period. After women become pregnant, they regularly go to the health station to check the fetal position to avoid difficult labor. A certain amount of leave is stipulated before and after delivery. After delivery, the female deputy director will represent the cooperative management committee to send brown sugar, eggs, and noodles worth two yuan. The habit of women only drinking thin rice soup after delivery has been completely broken. In addition, a patient card system and a medical record file system have also been established. When there is a patient, the doctor will come to see the patient and provide mobile medical care. If a member has a disease that the health station doctor cannot treat, the community will quickly send him to the nearby regional hospital or county hospital for treatment. The most outstanding work of the health station is that they are active propagandists and organizers of the health movement. They must participate in all meetings, large and small, in the community to publicize health care work. Because the doctors of the health station have become members of the agricultural cooperative, their treatment is evaluated annually by the community according to their work performance, and they are paid according to their work. This makes them not have to worry about losing their jobs if there are no patients. On the contrary, they believe that the fewer patients, the greater their work performance. The more income the agricultural cooperative has, the higher their remuneration will naturally increase. Therefore, the enthusiasm of doctors to serve the members and serve production is very high. In the past two years, no member of this village has been absent from work due to illness, and there have been no work-related accidents or miscarriages. In 1956, the number of workdays made by male and female members increased by more than 30% compared with 1955. Precisely because of this, the health station has been warmly loved and actively supported by all members.

Continue to move forward and formulate new plans: consolidate the results of eliminating the "four pests"; combine with accumulating fertilizer to demolish dilapidated walls; move the livestock farms to the edge of the village; build a public bathhouse; renovate the sports field; beautify the environment; renovate the ponds and build a flower and fruit garden.

Although the achievements of the health care work in Taiyang Village are huge, this has not made the Party branch there feel that the work has reached its peak, and there is nothing more to do in the future. On the contrary, they believe that there is still a lot to do in the future. According to the new requirements of the masses, they have put forward new plans to continue to move forward. The main points of this plan are: to further consolidate the results of eliminating the "four pests"; to combine with accumulating fertilizer to demolish dilapidated old walls; to gradually move the livestock farms to the edge of the village; to build a public bathhouse, which will be the first bathhouse to appear in the rural areas of Shanxi; to improve the work of the nurseries and set up kindergartens in the primary schools of the village; to renovate the existing sports field and add a set of basketball stands; to further green the four sides and beautify the environment; to renovate the ponds next to the village and build a flower and fruit garden around the ponds. In 1958, they will also strive to achieve a "no illiteracy" village and a grain yield of 400 jin per mu. Building Taiyang Village into a more affluent, more civilized, and more beautiful new socialist countryside, this beautiful ideal encourages the people of Taiyang Village to leap forward again and again.

The experience of Taiyang Village is blossoming and bearing fruit throughout Shanxi Province. Two-thirds of the villages in Jishan County have now promoted the experience of Taiyang Village and become "four-without" villages. Before this year's National Day, this county will become a "four-without" county. Our Shanxi will also become a "four-without" province in three to five years. Let us, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, confidently and fully power forward courageously!

    富足、文明、美丽的社会主义新农村
    李辉代表报告太阳村消灭“四害”促进生产的模范事迹
    我衷心拥护大会的各项报告，并且要坚决地贯彻执行。这里，我想把太阳村除“四害”、讲卫生的模范事迹向大会作一个汇报。
    苦战六年，提前十年消灭了“四害”，又穷又脏的“瘟村”变成了人畜健康五谷丰登的新村
    太阳村是山西晋南专区稷山县的一个村子。全村共有二百一十八户，九百一十三口人。过去，这个村是一个又穷又脏、疾病流行、亲戚不来、客人不往的落后村。甭说，四害横行、家家户户又酸又臭又黑暗，臭虫、虱子、跳蚤，样样俱全，而且人们特别恶劣的习惯是随地大小便，乱堆垃圾，乱倒脏水。但是，从一九五二年反对美帝国主义细菌战起，经过六年的苦战，到现在已经提前十年消灭了“四害”，把一个又脏又穷的“瘟村”变成了人畜健康，五谷丰登，人们过着文明幸福生活的社会主义新农村。最近两年来，这个村已经有省内外的四万多人去参观过。我也去过两次。所有去参观的人，进了太阳村都有一个共同的感觉——精神振奋，心情舒畅。有的人在参观以后，深受感动地说，来参观前，怀疑报纸的报道是否有些夸大。参观以后的印象：恰恰相反，报纸上的报道不是夸大了，而是十分不足。在这里，街道像城市中的马路一样平整而光洁，大街小巷都扫得干干净净，在道路的两旁隔不多远就有一个公共厕所和砖砌的垃圾箱。在这里，厕所坑上有盖板，坑里洒着消毒剂。村里、村边没有污水坑，根本没有苍蝇、蚊子能够孳生的地方。麻雀和老鼠统统绝迹。不久前有过这样一件有趣的事：一个记者到太阳村访问，他看到空中飞着一只小鸟，就给村干部说，你们这里还有麻雀。村干部肯定说没有了。后来，村里的一个神枪手，把记者看见的那只小鸟打下来了。一看，原来是一只金枝鸟。在这里，牛马有棚，鸡猪有圈，柴草有场。就是在畜圈里也闻不到臭味。所有的墙壁都粉刷得雪白，墙上画着发展生产、热爱和平、学习文化、除“四害”、讲卫生等富有教育意义的壁画。特别令人钦佩的是，在全村所有雪白的墙上和公共厕所的墙壁上，三年来没有一个人画过一个黑道道，虽然这是一件小事，但它可以说明太阳村群众是何等爱护公共场所的整洁。在这里，宅旁、路旁、村旁和农民的院里，从一九五六年起开始栽起了花草树木。到春暖花开的时候，已经可以看到优美的风景。在这里，家家是窗明屋净，锅头、桌凳和箱柜上没有尘土，碗筷和灶具放在用白纱布遮盖着的厨柜里。全村定期进行室内消毒，户户有痰盂，几千年来人们随地吐痰的恶习破除了。在这里，讲究个人卫生也开始形成新的风尚。人人每天清早起来，都要洗脸，都要打扫屋内屋外。百分之八十的青壮年开始有了刷牙的习惯。衣服整洁、饭前洗手、修剪指甲，外出时戴口罩，妇女们经期用月经带等等，都已经普遍做到了。
    太阳村卫生保健工作的成果，已经受到事实的考验。一九五七年春，当流行性感冒在稷山县蔓延时，邻村很多人被传染，但没有能够侵入太阳村。那时，县公安局干部张乐三得了感冒回到家里后，他爱人一面向保健站报告，一面让他戴上口罩，并且劝他立即回县城医治，第二天他就回城里去了。小学生刘牡丹在外祖母家里染了轻微的感冒，回村后即让他父亲报告保健站，同时，为了避免传染其他同学，请假不去上学。刘二女老太太到东位村女儿家伺候女儿坐月子，看到女儿家很脏，吃不下饭，跑回自己家里取来馍馍吃。她的女儿受到她的刺激和教育，也开始讲卫生了。这位老太太的行动，看起来好像有些反常，但这确是事实。
    所有以上这一切，和六年以前的情况来比，真是有天壤之别。所以这个村的群众说：“同是一个太阳村，前后两个样”。“过去的太阳村没有太阳，感谢共产党给我们送来了太阳，现在算是个真正的太阳村了”。
    太阳村前后三次向“四害”进军，群众发挥了顽强的干劲和无穷的智慧，“四害”除尽，增积了肥料，提高了生产
    太阳村面貌的改变并不是一帆风顺的。而是在党的坚强领导下，贯彻执行卫生保健工作与生产相结合的方针，不断地发动群众，向传统的不讲卫生的风俗习惯进行艰苦的斗争之后，才取得了胜利。很显然，以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，实质上是一个移风易俗的社会改革运动。太阳村的事实告诉我们，决不可以低估这个运动的政治意义。
    当一九五二年，为了反对美帝国主义的细菌战，各地开展爱国卫生运动的时候，一般群众对讲卫生抱有抵触情绪，在太阳村也不例外。当时太阳村的人说：“穷干净，富邋遢，谁讲卫生谁倒霉”。可是事实证明，不是讲卫生倒霉，而是不讲卫生才会倒霉。有这样一个例子：农民张银和的两个小孩得了痳疹，村干部劝他把家里打扫得干净一些，不要让小孩出门，要请医生来看。他不听干部的话，还说：“花钱求医，不如叩头求神”。结果，他的两个孩子都被巫婆给治死了。而村里其他患痳疹的小孩，经过医生治疗，都恢复了健康。一九五二年春，这个村在大人中间也发生了一次严重的传染病；得病者六十二人，经过县里派来的医生进行急治，大部得救，七人死亡。党支部就紧紧抓住这些事例向群众进行了教育，发动群众诉不讲卫生造成生命财产损失的苦，宣传了科学卫生常识。这样，部分群众才开始认识了“求神不如求医，求医不如防疫”的道理。紧接着，党支部提出了“开展爱国卫生运动，人强马壮、发展生产才有保证”，“人人动手，做到四净五灭”的口号。首先组织群众突击消灭危害人身健康最严重的虱子、臭虫、跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊子，并且开始了捕鼠工作。经过一年多的努力，村里的环境卫生有了初步的改善，传染病大大减少了。从一九五三年到一九五五年的三年间，患过传染病的只有一人。
    但是，由于党支部放松了领导，群众卫生运动在一九五五年曾经一度低落。那时，有的人说：“讲卫生只是为了美观，不解决实际问题还耽误生产”，有的妇女说：“孩子多了就不能讲卫生”，“家里养鸡又养猪，那能讲卫生”。许多卫生小组长也不愿干了，卫生工作几乎处于停顿状态。这时，党支部在县委的监督下，便重整旗鼓，扭转局面。首先，抓住对卫生工作比较热心的共青团员、小学教师、学生等积极分子进行了重点教育。组织当地的中西医师，在农业技术夜校、民校和小学内增添卫生课程。还举办了妇幼卫生讲座和牲口饲养常识讲座。这样，就出现了一批有政治热情，懂得科学知识，能够带头讲卫生的积极分子。然后，依靠他们向群众进行了深入的爱国卫生的宣传工作。他们用展览、演戏、快板、鼓词、黑板报、标语牌等许多生动活泼的宣传方式，随时随地针对群众的思想动态进行宣传。其次，党支部还发动群众开展了爱国卫生竞赛。采取抓两头带动中间的方法，定期进行检查评比工作。以农业社的生产队为单位，把太阳村划分成四个卫生区。在卫生区与卫生区之间，户与户、人与人之间，普遍开展了竞赛运动。在开始一段竞赛中，他们在每次检查评比后，对先进的户，在他的门首贴上“最清洁的户”的字条。对落后的户，则在他的门首贴上“最脏的户”的字条。这样做，不但没有促使落后者向先进者看齐，反而引起他们的严重反感，有的人甚至公然抗拒检查家庭卫生。以后，他们就改变了办法。把家庭清洁卫生的程度分为甲、乙、丙三等。而且对待丙等户，一见进步就加以表扬。就这样，把群众的集体英雄主义的劲头鼓起来了。比先进，学先进的口号成了群众自觉的行动。到去年年底为止，全村丙等户没有了。特等户和甲等户占三分之二，乙等户只占三分之一。再次，为了培养农民新的生活方式，党支部又发动群众制订了爱国卫生公约和饮食卫生守则。并由卫生保健站按照饮食卫生守则，训练了全村家庭主妇，使她们养成做饭前后洗手，勤剪指甲，经常用净水刷洗炊事工具，按时做饭等习惯，做到每顿饭又节约粮食，又卫生，又可口。
    经过以上这些工作，群众的思想和生活习惯发生了显著的变化。到一九五六年，在全村实现了高级合作化的基础上，特别是在全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布之后，太阳村的爱国卫生运动就有了一个飞跃的进展。党支部根据全国农业发展纲要除“四害”的要求，向全村男女老少发出了彻底消灭“四害”的战斗号召。又响亮地提出了“除四害，讲卫生，兵强马壮，多积肥，多打粮”的口号。并且用实例，算苍蝇、蚊子、麻雀、老鼠的危害账，激发群众对四害的仇恨心。于是，一个大规模的围剿“四害”的战斗展开了。经过这次战斗，残余的苍蝇、蚊子被彻底消灭了，老鼠和麻雀基本上也被消灭了。在这次以除“四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动中，结合改善环境卫生，群众创造了二十九种积肥的办法。一切尘土、墙根污土、炕土、烟灰、房顶尘灰、茅锈等等，都经过清除用作肥料。就这样，在一九五六年夏季以前，使当年麦田得以两次追肥，每亩平均产量达到二百零二斤，比一九五五年提高了百分之六十五点六。
    与此同时，大力开展了牲畜保健工作。饲养牲口做到六净，即水净、草净、料净、槽净、牲口身上净、圈里净；三不见，即圈不见粪（随时垫干土）、槽不见渣、棚不见尘。一九五三年，因牲口饲养的不好，全村死了十二头。一九五六年不但没有死一头，没一头因有病休息，而且还繁殖了幼畜二十三头。在做好了以上工作之后，党支部又领导群众进行美化环境的工作，发动群众在院内和街上植树种花，把厕所移到院外，整修垃圾箱，添置各种卫生用具。到这时，全村男女老少讲卫生已经制度化、经常化。在一九五六年全省社会主义积极分子大会上，太阳村得到了卫生模范村的光荣称号。
    一九五七年九月，毛主席在党的八届三中全会上提出了一定要把中国变为“四无”国的伟大号召。为了响应毛主席的这个号召，在十月间，全省性的以除“四害”为中心的农村卫生保健工作会议，就在稷山县举行。所有与会的人都参观了太阳村。推广太阳村的经验正是这次会议的中心课题。太阳村的人们并没有因此而自满。他们在党支部的领导下，又一次检查了除“四害”工作，发现还有一些残余的老鼠、麻雀。大家自然觉得这与“卫生模范村”的光荣称号不相容。于是，向老鼠、麻雀展开了扫尾战。可是残余的老鼠、麻雀越来越狡猾，单凭一种办法是不解决问题的。群众针对它们的活动规律，创造了几十种消灭老鼠、麻雀的方法。在这里，青少年组成的突击队起着出色的作用。经过两个月的战斗，太阳村终于成为“四无”村了。据统计，六年来，全村共消灭了苍蝇二百四十四斤，老鼠一万五千七百四十二只，麻雀二千零一十八只。挖蛹二十九斤。
    太阳村的经验告诉我们，只要人人都充分地认识到苍蝇、蚊子、麻雀、老鼠的危害性，从而高度地仇恨它们，那末大家就会产生出一股顽强的干劲和无穷的智慧。彻底消灭“四害”所需的时间就可以大大缩短。太阳村前后向“四害”三次进军，实际上只用了三年的时间。估计今后在其他地方，做得好，有一两年的时间就行了。
    卫生保健站的工作人员深入家庭和田间开展卫生保健工作，对促进卫生运动的开展和巩固运动成果起了很大作用
    应该特别提到，在太阳村的爱国卫生运动中，乡卫生保健站（在太阳村设有分站）对于发动和教育群众，促进运动的开展和巩固运动的成果等方面，都起了杠杆作用。随着高级合作化的实现，原来私营性质的联合诊所也转变成为社会主义性质的卫生保健站。两年来，保健站在党支部的领导和支持下，贯彻执行了勤俭办站，预防为主，为生产服务，为社员服务的方针。在农业社内推行了劳动保护制度，建立了保健工作网。每个生产队都有保健室和接生组。医生和保健员经常结合医疗工作，深入社员家庭和田间开展卫生保健工作。医生定期给社员检查身体，生产队根据检查结果，按照社员的健康程度、体质条件和劳动能力，合理派活。农业社和保健站特别关心妇女的健康。每个生产队都实行妇女经期挂签制。生产队对经期妇女允许请假或者只派她们做轻活。开始，许多青年妇女害羞，不愿叫人知道自己来了月经。以后，由于她们体验到这个制度的好处，每当月经来了，就自动到保健室去挂签。妇女怀孕后，就定期到保健站检查胎位，避免难产。产前产后规定一定的假期。在分娩之后，女副社长就代表社管理委员会送去价值二元的红糖、鸡蛋和挂面等。妇女产后只喝稀米汤的习惯已经彻底打破了。此外，还建立了病人卡片制和病历档案制。有了病人，医生就上门看病，巡回医疗。遇到社员得了保健站医生难以治的疾病，社内就迅速地把他送到附近的地区医院或者县立医院去治疗。保健站最出色的工作，还在于他们是卫生运动的积极的宣传者和组织者。社里无论大小会议，他们都要插一脚，宣传卫生保健工作。因为保健站的医生们成了农业社的社员，他们的待遇每年由社按工作成绩评定，实行按劳取酬，这就使他们不必担心没有病人会失业的问题。相反的，他们认为病人越少，他们的工作成绩就越大。农业社的收入越多，自然他们所得的报酬也就随着增高。因此，医生们为社员服务、为生产服务的积极性都非常高涨。两年来，这个村没有一个社员因病缺勤，也没有发生过一件工伤事故和孕妇流产事件。一九五六年男女社员所作的劳动日即比一九五五年各增长百分之三十以上。正是由于这样，保健站受到全体社员的热烈的爱戴和积极的支持。
    继续前进，订出新的计划：巩固除“四害”的成果；结合积肥，拆除破墙；牲口场移到村边；兴建公共澡塘一座；改建体育场；美化环境；整修池塘，建设一个花果园
    太阳村的卫生保健工作的成绩虽然是巨大的，但这并没有使那里的党支部感到工作已经到顶，今后再没有什么可做的了。相反的，他们认为今后要作的事还很多。他们根据群众新的要求，又提出了继续前进的新的计划。这个计划的要点是：进一步巩固除“四害”的成果；结合积肥，拆除破烂旧墙；把牲畜饲养场逐步移到村边；兴建公共澡塘一座，这将是山西农村有史以来出现的第一座澡塘；改进托儿所工作，在本村小学内附设幼儿园；改建现有体育场，增设篮球架一付；进一步绿化四旁，美化环境；整修村旁池塘，并在池塘周围建设一个花果园。一九五八年，他们还要为实现“无盲”村和粮食亩产四百斤而奋斗。把太阳村建设成更加富足的、更加文明的、更加美丽的社会主义新农村，这个美好的理想鼓舞着太阳村的人们跃进再跃进。
    太阳村的经验正在山西全省范围内开花结果。稷山县现在已经有三分之二的村庄推广了太阳村的经验而成为“四无”村。在今年国庆节以前这个县就将成为“四无”县。我们山西在三年到五年内，也将成为“四无”省。让我们在党中央和毛主席的领导下，满怀信心地开足马力勇往直前吧！
    以上发言不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
