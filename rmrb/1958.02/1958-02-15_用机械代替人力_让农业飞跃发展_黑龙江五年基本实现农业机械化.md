Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 13th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Cheng Xiaohou): The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, in an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on the 10th, based on central directives, fully assessed the indomitable and overwhelming drive emerging from cadres at all levels and the broad masses of workers and peasants, as well as the development conditions in Heilongjiang Province's industry, agriculture, and various other fields. It proposed that Heilongjiang Province should achieve agricultural mechanization within seven years; through three years of hard work, striving to basically achieve agricultural mechanization within five years, so that about 70% of the work in cultivation, water conservancy, and processing of agricultural and sideline products would be carried out by machinery.

The meeting focused on discussing the development of local industries that are interconnected with the overall modernization of agriculture in the province. The meeting determined that the total annual output value of local industries (including industries devolved from the central government and handicrafts) in the province should increase from the current 2.3 billion yuan to over 10 billion yuan within five years, about five times the current output value. At that time, the output value of local industries would be more than twice the total output value of agricultural and sideline products.

From the specific situation of rural areas in Heilongjiang Province, the need for agricultural mechanization is extremely urgent. The characteristics here are few people and abundant land, fertile soil, and a frost-free period of more than 140 days in the southernmost areas and only 90-odd days in the northernmost areas. Each male laborer in the countryside generally has to bear the burden of cultivating 50 mu of land, and some even up to 100 mu or more. Due to the extreme lack of labor, cultivation is relatively extensive. According to calculations, in some southern provinces, cultivating one mu of dry land generally requires ten man-days, and one mu of paddy field requires more than twenty man-days, while Heilongjiang only requires three man-days and ten man-days, respectively. In this area with few people, abundant land, and fertile soil, replacing human labor with machinery in agricultural production will bring about a leap in agricultural development.

Heilongjiang Province has many favorable conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization. First of all, there is a strong industrial base and a strong state farm base here. The output value of local industries alone is now equivalent to the total output value of agricultural and sideline products in the province. Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi and other places are all cities with developed machinery manufacturing industries, especially with the foundation of agricultural machinery manufacturing industries, and are capable of supplying a large amount of agricultural machinery to support the countryside. It is expected that the suburbs of Harbin and other cities will achieve agricultural mechanization within two years.

Heilongjiang Province has a history of using machinery for agricultural cultivation for ten years. At present, there are more than 70 large-scale mechanized state-owned farms in the province. These farms have not only trained a large number of technical personnel and accumulated a lot of experience, but also continue to increase production. These facts have made farmers clearly see the benefits of mechanization, and therefore they yearn for agricultural mechanization more urgently. In addition, there are already 28 agricultural machinery and tractor stations in the province, and the area cultivated by tractors has reached more than 10 million mu, accounting for about 10% of the current total cultivated land area in the province. The area cultivated with new-style farm tools has accounted for about 25% of the total cultivated land area in the province.

Heilongjiang Province has an even more important condition, which is that agricultural cooperativization has been further consolidated. The public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives is increasing day by day. Some agricultural cooperatives in Baiquan and other counties have already purchased their own tractors. Recently, more cooperatives have requested industrial departments to sell tractors to them. At the same time, most of the cultivated land in Heilongjiang Province is flat, and agricultural mechanization can also give full play to its effectiveness.

The meeting decided that Comrade Ouyang Qin, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and other responsible comrades should immediately go to various places during the Spring Festival to convey the central government's instructions and the provincial party committee's decisions, and lead the people of the province to speed up their pace and leap forward.

    用机械代替人力　让农业飞跃发展
    黑龙江五年基本实现农业机械化
    据新华社哈尔滨13日电　新华社记者程晓候报道：中共黑龙江省委在10日召开的常委扩大会议上根据中央指示，充分估计到各级干部和广大工农群众涌现出来的那一股无坚不摧排山倒海的干劲和黑龙江省工业、农业以及各个方面发展的条件，提出黑龙江省要在七年内实现农业机械化；苦战三年，争取在五年内就基本上达到农业机械化，使耕作、水利以及农副业产品加工等工作的70％左右用机械来进行。
    会议着重讨论了同全省农业现代化相互关连的地方工业的发展问题。会议确定全省地方工业（包括中央下放工业和手工业）在五年内由现在的年产值二十三亿多元发展到年产值一百多亿元，为现在产值的五倍左右，那时地方工业的产值就相当农副业总产值两倍以上。
    从黑龙江省农村的具体情况看，农业机械化的需要是十分迫切的。这里的特点是人少地多，土地肥沃，无霜期在最南的地区是一百四十多天，最北的地区只有九十几天。农村每个男劳动力一般要负担五十亩耕地，多的达到一百多亩。由于劳动力十分缺乏，耕作比较粗放。根据计算，南方有些省份，耕作一亩旱地一般需用十个人工、一亩水田需用二十多个人工，而黑龙江只用三个人工和十个人工。在这种人少地多土地肥沃的地区，农业生产上用机械代替人力，将会带来农业的飞跃发展。
    黑龙江省实现农业机械化有许多有利条件，首先是这里有强大的工业基础和强大的国营农场基础。仅地方工业的产值，现在就已经相当于全省农副业的总产值。哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯等地又都是机器制造工业发达的城市，特别是具有农业机器制造工业的基础，是可能输送大量农业机械支援农村的。哈尔滨等城市的郊区，预计在两年内就可以实现农业机械化。
    黑龙江省农业使用机械耕作已有十年的历史。现在，全省有七十多个大型的机械化国营农场，这些农场不仅训练了大批技术力量，积累了许多经验，而且不断得到增产。这些事实使农民看清楚了机械化的好处，因此更迫切地向往农业机械化。另外，全省农业机器拖拉机站已有二十八个，拖拉机耕作面积已达一千万亩以上，占全省目前总耕地面积的10％左右。新式农具耕作的面积已占全省耕地总面积的25％左右。
    黑龙江省还有一个更重要的条件，就是农业合作化已经进一步得到巩固。农业社的公共积累日益增多。拜泉等县有些农业社已经自己购买了拖拉机。近来还有更多的社要求工业部门卖拖拉机给他们。同时，黑龙江省大部分耕地平坦，农业机械化也能充分地发挥效能。
    会议决定立即由省委第一书记欧阳钦等负责同志，在春节期间分头到各地去传达中央指示及省委决定，领导全省人民快马加鞭，向前跃进。
