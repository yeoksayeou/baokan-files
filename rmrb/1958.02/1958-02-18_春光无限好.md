    A complex medley of sounds,
    The sounds of spring,
    Covering the northern land.
    The North is excited and busy.
    Our chief engineer,
    Walks thoughtfully through the fields.
    The freshly turned, soft clods of soil,
    Brush against his silver-grey trouser legs,
    As if he were walking through the
    Red camellias of his hometown.
    The sunlight shines on his wise brow.
    In the newly built thousands of water channels,
    He happily sees
    The flowing confidence of hundreds of millions of people.
    From the earthy yellow road at the village entrance,
    A large convoy of carts pulls furnace ash and manure,
    Streaming in endlessly like flowing water,
    The successive cracking of whips,
    Like firecrackers during the Spring Festival.
    In the distance, a dark mass of people,
    Like overflowing spring water,
    Headed to repair the main canals, dig reservoirs,
    The old and the women are all rushing to go.
    Ah, the fields under the sunlight,
    People laboring busily,
    To ride the wind and cleave the waves,
    To cross the Yellow River and span the Yangtze!
    What a charming scene.
    And he, in the fields,
    What a happy moment this must be.
    He seems unwilling to disturb anyone,
    Walking humbly and affably,
    But the whirlwind of revolution,
    Follows his steady and profound footsteps,
    Rising up, spreading out.
    Like he did in the South.
    He walks towards the village.
    The village is as quiet as a zither.
    The farmers greet him with laughter.
    As if seeing their uncle and elder brother,
    Everyone's heart is warm,
    Wanting to pour out to him, in detail,
    As many words as there are leaves on a tree.
    The commune office is in a meeting;
    This meeting has lasted all night.
    The oil lamp is still on the table,
    And the targets have been revised ten times;
    In just a flick of the fingers,
    Advanced becomes backward.
    Some of the commune cadres are discussing,
    Some are pondering,
    The fingers tapping lightly like coral.
    He comes in,
    Bringing with him the strength to overturn mountains and seas,
    Everyone's heart
    Is infused with striving and warmth.
    The five-year plan will be completed this year!
    The bright little room is clamorous,
    The constantly revised figures
    Are sent to the county,
    To the provincial capital, to Beijing, by frequent long-distance calls.
    He smiles silently,
    Walking through the clean, transparent village,
    Following the bright water channel.
    Six hundred million fiery hearts follow him.
    He looks around,
    Seeing the water channels like the nerves of the human body,
    Densely covering the abundant land;
    An unprecedented drive,
    Surging like an ocean of storms;
    The earth is all green,
    Barren mountains lower their heads to give way,
    Everyone is like a round of red sun,
    The great harvest arrives in the motherland with a world-shaking roar!

    春光无限好
    沙鸥
    一片繁杂的音响，
    春天的音响，
    复盖着北方的土地。
    北方是激动而忙碌的。
    我们的总工程师，
    深思地走过田野。
    刚翻开的松软的泥块，
    拂着他银灰色的裤脚，
    他像在家乡的
    红红的山茶中走过。
    阳光照着他智慧的前额。
    在新修的成千上万的水渠里，
    他高兴地看见
    流动着亿万人的信心。
    从村口的土黄色的路上，
    大车队拉着炉灰与粪土，
    流水似地源源而来，
    鞭梢的接二连三的响声，
    像春节放的鞭炮。
    远处，黑压压的一道人流，
    如泛滥的春水，
    那是去修干渠，挖水库的，
    老人与妇女都抢着去了。
    阳光下的田野啊，
    人们繁忙地劳动，
    为了乘风破浪，
    过黄河，跨长江！
    多么迷人的景象。
    而他，正在田野，
    这该是多么幸福的时刻。
    他像不愿惊动一个人，
    谦逊地、平易地走着，
    但革命的旋风，
    却跟着他沉稳而深刻的脚印，
    升腾起来，扩散开来。
    像他在南方那样。
    他向村里走去了。
    村里安静如一张七弦琴。
    农民用欢笑接待他。
    像看见了自己的伯父和兄长，
    每个人的心里都热呼呼的，
    都想把树叶一样多的话语，
    向他细细倾吐。
    社办公室正在开会；
    这个会已开了一个通宵。
    油灯还放在桌上，
    而指标已经过十次修改；
    仅仅一弹指间，
    先进就变成落后了。
    社干部们有的在议论，
    有的在沉思，
    轻轻敲着的指头像珊瑚。
    他进门来了，
    把排山倒海的劲头带来了，
    每个人的胸怀
    都为奋发与温暖所灌注。
    五年的规划今年完成！
    明亮的小屋喧腾，
    不断修改的数字
    用频繁的长途电话送到县里，
    送到省城、送到北京。
    他默默含笑，
    穿过了清洁的透明的村子，
    顺着明亮的水渠走去。
    六亿颗火热的心跟着他。
    他环顾四周，
    见水渠如人体的神经，
    密布在丰满的国土上；
    从未出现过的干劲，
    像风暴的海洋汹涌澎湃；
    大地碧绿一色，
    荒山低头让路，
    人人都像一轮红日，
    大丰收带着震惊世界的巨响
    轰然地降临祖国！
