Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 11th:  President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said at a civic welcome meeting in Bombay on the evening of February 10th that a decisive battle is currently underway between the forces of peace and the forces of war, but the forces of peace are increasingly gaining strength.

President Ho Chi Minh also said that he was very pleased to see that Asian and African countries are playing an important role in defending world peace, and that India has made valuable contributions to world peace. The Bandung Conference and the Asian Solidarity Conference held in the Indian capital have united Asian and African countries in the struggle against colonialism and against war. The recent Cairo Conference further strengthened the unity and fighting spirit of the peoples of these countries.

He said that after nine years of arduous struggle against colonialism, the Vietnamese people have achieved victory. But this is not a complete victory, and their country is still divided into two regions. He expressed his belief that their struggle will surely achieve final victory.

Bombay Mayor Dandekar, in his welcoming address, said that as one of the main founders of an independent Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh has not only won the respect and love of his people, but also the respect and love of all freedom-loving people in the world. His visit to India will help bring the two countries closer together and make the principles of "Panchsheel" more widely accepted.

Mayor Dandekar also presented President Ho Chi Minh with a dedication, which was written on a piece of dark red silk in a jewelry box inlaid with ivory and silver.

    据新华社新德里11日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明2月10日晚上在孟买市民欢迎会上说，目前，和平力量与战争力量之间正在进行着一次决战，但是和平力量正在日益得势。
    胡志明主席又说，他很高兴看到亚非国家在保卫世界和平方面正在起着重要的作用，而印度对世界和平已经作出了有价值的贡献。万隆会议和在印度首都召开的亚洲团结会议使得亚非国家在反对殖民主义和反对战争的斗争中团结起来了。最近的开罗会议进一步加强了这些国家人民的团结和战斗精神。
    他说，越南人民经过了九年反对殖民主义的艰苦斗争，已经取得了胜利。但是这不是完全的胜利，他们的国家仍然被分割为两个地区。他表示相信，他们的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
    孟买市长当德致欢迎词说，作为独立的越南的主要缔造者之一，胡志明主席不仅赢得了他的人民的尊敬和爱戴，而且也赢得了世界一切爱好自由的人民的尊敬和爱戴。他的印度之行将有助于使两国更加亲密，使“潘查希拉”的原则更广泛地为人们接受。
    当德市长并且向胡志明主席赠送了献词，这个献词是写在镶着象牙和银边的首饰盒中的一块深红色绸缎上的。
