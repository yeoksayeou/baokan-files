Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: Sending people for labor, sending manure for fertilizer, fighting drought when it's dry, rushing to rescue when there's a flood – the People's Liberation Army (PLA) units have contributed significantly to supporting increased agricultural production and in the struggles against flood prevention, rescue, drought resistance, and disaster relief over the past year.

In the past year, the PLA units have used nearly 20 million labor days to support national construction, most of which were used to support agricultural production. According to statistics, the units have completed more than 400 major water conservancy projects in the past year, including more than 100 reservoirs, more than 240 canals, and more than 1.8 million cubic meters of earthwork for embankments. Under the battle cry of "competing with the spring floods and racing against time," the Guangzhou troops once stopped their military exercises and worked in the rain to build 111 water conservancy projects with a total of more than 43 million cubic meters of earth and stone, enabling more than 870,000 mu of farmland to be irrigated or increased in drought and flood resistance. The officers and soldiers of a heroic regiment who participated in the construction of the Jieyang Shuihou Reservoir completed the project more than 20 days ahead of schedule, turning mountain floods into water conservancy. The Wuhan troops helped agricultural cooperatives build a total of 165 li of canals and embankments and dig more than 1,200 wells and ponds. In arid areas, the troops actively participated in the drought resistance struggle. The Beijing troops dispatched 140,000 labor days and 14,000 animal labor days for drought resistance and replanting. The Jinan troops dispatched more than 99,000 people in ten days to water more than 11,000 mu of land and plant 2,500 mu of wheat for agricultural cooperatives. During each busy farming season, the troops stationed in various places have given strong support to agricultural cooperatives in a timely and proactive manner. According to statistics from the Lanzhou, Kunming, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Shenyang troops, nearly 2 million mu of farmland were supported in farming operations. The Guangzhou troops also harvested more than 132,000 mu of crops for farmers in one year. A unit of the Nanjing troops helped the Luoma Lake area of Jiangsu Province harvest 12,000 mu of wheat. Because the officers and soldiers harvested cleanly and with little loss, each farmer could earn an average of five to seven yuan more. When this unit set off to return to its garrison, the local farmers set off firecrackers to welcome them.

According to statistics, the troops stationed in various places provided farmers with a total of 400 million jin of fertilizer last year, and helped the masses rush to transport more than 150 million jin of fertilizer. The officers and soldiers of the Huanggang Military Sub-district and Macheng County Conscription Bureau of the Hubei Military District, together with the members of the Feiben First Cooperative, accumulated 92,000 dan of fertilizer, and the Conscription Bureau also sent 4,500 dan of manure fertilizer to the members. The members gratefully said: "Crops are like a flower, all relying on manure as the base. Our harvest is inseparable from the accumulation of fertilizer and support from the People's Liberation Army." In addition, the troops stationed in various places dispatched more than 35,600 military horses, more than 1,160 automobiles, more than 11,800 horse-drawn carts, and more than 100 water pumps to support agricultural production. Some troops also gave retired military horses to agricultural cooperatives or state-owned farms free of charge. The Lanzhou troops alone sent out 3,178 horses.

Last year, approximately 300,000 PLA officers and soldiers were involved in flood prevention, rescue, and disaster relief work. In order to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the people in the disaster areas, the troops used a large amount of combat readiness materials, including more than 1,000 rubber boats and more than 1,000 vehicles. The Air Force dispatched more than 240 sorties of aircraft, airlifting 560 tons of food and rescue equipment. The officers and soldiers blocked more than 1,600 important breaches and dangerous points, repaired a total of more than 400 li of dikes, and rescued more than 40,000 people from the water, salvaging more than 10 million jin of grain and more than 4,000 tons of materials. When the Songhua River water situation was urgent and Harbin was threatened by floods, the local garrison immediately went all out to prevent floods and transferred a division from other places to provide support. When the water situation was serious, General Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, also personally went to the Jiangdi embankment to inspect and participate in the rescue. Thanks to the selfless rescue of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, the dangerous situation was finally turned into safety. In addition, the troops stationed in various places donated more than 600,000 yuan of relief funds, more than 270,000 jin of relief grain, and more than 100,000 pieces of various clothing to timely relieve the people in the disaster areas.

    要工派人　要肥送粪　逢旱抗旱　逢洪抢险
    解放军支援农业生产热情高
    新华社13日讯　要工派人、要肥送粪、逢旱抗旱、逢洪抢险，解放军各部队一年来在支援农业增产和防汛、抢险、抗旱、救灾斗争中贡献出了很大力量。
    去年一年中，解放军各部队用了近两千万个劳动日支援国家各项建设，其中大多数劳动日是用于支援农业生产的。据统计，各部队在过去一年中修成的较大水利工程有四百多项，包括水库一百多个、水渠两百四十多条和堤坝一百八十多万土方。在“与春洪争先、和时间赛跑”的战斗口号下，广州部队曾经停止操课，冒雨修建了一百零一项共四千三百多万土石方的水利工程，使八十七万多亩田受到灌溉或增加了抗旱、抗涝能力。参加修建揭阳水吼水库的某英雄团官兵，提前二十多天完工，从此使山洪变成了水利。武汉部队帮助农业社修筑渠堤共长一百六十五华里，打井挖塘一千二百多个。在干旱地区，部队都奋力投入了抗旱斗争。北京部队为抗旱抢种出动了十四万个劳动日和一万四千个畜力工日。济南部队在十天内出动九万九千多人次，给农业社浇地一万一千多亩、种麦两千五百亩。在各个农忙季节，各地驻军都及时地主动地给予农业社以大力支援。据兰州、昆明、成都、武汉、沈阳等部队统计，支援农田作业近两百万亩。广州部队在一年中也给农民收割庄稼十三万两千多亩。南京部队某部帮助江苏省骆马湖地区收割了一万二千亩小麦，由于官兵们割得净、掉得少，使每户农民平均可多收益五元到七元；当这支部队动身返回驻地时，当地农民鸣放爆竹欢送他们。
    据统计，各地驻军去年支援农民的肥料共达四亿斤，帮助群众抢运肥料一亿五千多万斤。湖北军区黄冈军分区和麻城县兵役局的官兵们，同飞奔一社的社员一起积肥九万二千担，兵役局另外又送给社员四千五百担粪肥。社员们感激地说：庄稼一支花，全靠粪当家，我们的丰收和解放军的积肥支援是分不开的。此外，各地驻军出动了三万五千六百多匹军马，一千一百六十多辆汽车，一万一千八百多辆马车和一百多部抽水机，来支援农业生产。有些部队还把退役军马无偿地送给了农业社或国营农场，仅兰州部队就送出三千一百七十八匹。
    去年投入防汛抢险救灾工作的解放军官兵约有三十万人。为了保障灾区人民生命财产的安全，部队曾动用了大批战备物资，其中包括橡皮舟一千多只、汽车一千多辆。空军部队曾出动飞机两百四十多架次，空投食物和抢救器材五百六十吨。官兵们共堵重要决口险处一千六百多处，修堤总长四百多里，并从水中抢救出四万多人，打捞出一千多万斤粮食和四千多吨物资。当松花江水情紧急、哈尔滨市遭受洪水威胁时，当地驻军立即全力投入防汛，并从外地调去一个师支援。在水情严重时，人民解放军副总参谋长张宗逊上将还亲临江堤视察和参加抢险。由于广大官兵们的忘我抢救，终于使险情转危为安。此外，各地驻军还捐献了救济款六十多万元、救济粮二十七万多斤、各种衣物十多万件，及时地救济了受灾地区的人民。
