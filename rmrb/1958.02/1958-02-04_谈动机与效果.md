　　On Motive and Effect
　　Li Zhengwen
　　Since the anti-Rightist struggle, many rightists have verbally claimed that while their effect—opposing the Party and socialism—was bad, their motive—"helping the Party rectify its work style"—was good. Today, during the handling of the Rightists, another group of comrades with "good intentions" have emerged, also misled by the Rightists, saying that their motives were not bad. In summary, the reasons are nothing more than: the relationship between motive and effect is not a causal one of planting melons and getting melons, planting beans and getting beans, and sometimes they are inconsistent. For example, in a soccer game, both teams want to win, but one always loses; students applying to universities all want to enter their desired schools, but many "fail the list"; scientific researchers all want to make amazing inventions, but many fail. Therefore, the bad effect of the Rightists does not necessarily prove that their motives were also bad. It was due to low level, incorrect methods, individualism, or accidental errors, "originally trying to split firewood with force, but the axe fell off and injured bystanders."
　　This statement of the relationship between motive and effect is completely wrong when applied to the Rightists. Look, the Rightists fiercely attacked Marxism-Leninism, unscrupulously vilified the leadership of the Communist Party, and demanded bourgeois democracy and freedom while opposing the fundamental system of socialism. They appreciate capitalism so much and hate socialism so much. Can this be said to be just a matter of general ideology and style? Let’s take the examples that the Rightists like to use. For example, losing a soccer game, students not being admitted, and scientific researchers failing in experiments, such situations certainly exist, but they are completely irrelevant compared to the Rightists' opposition to the Party and socialism. If you have to compare, then the Rightists' crimes of opposing the Party and socialism are like a soccer player not shooting at the opponent's goal, but always cooperating from the inside out, shooting at his own goal; the Rightists are also like a student who, when answering exam questions, does not do his best, but instead wields his pen and "vividly" scolds the universities; the Rightists are also like a scientific researcher who does not try his best to experiment, but destroys the experimental products. Can this kind of failure be said to be due to low level, incorrect methods, or accidental errors? Obviously, these are not the reasons. If it is a matter of level, then it can only be said of the soccer player that he has repeatedly attacked the opponent's goal but failed to score, of the student that he has racked his brains but still had to submit a blank paper, and of the scientific researcher that he was conscientious and responsible but failed repeatedly. If it is a matter of method, then it can only be said of the soccer player that he lost because of defects in tactics, of the student that he failed because of violating examination rules, and of the scientific researcher that he took a detour because of incorrect experimental methods. If it is a simple matter of individualism, then it can only be said of the soccer player that he caused failure because he liked to show off and did not cooperate well, of the student that he caused failure because he tried to be unconventional and overclever, and of the scientific researcher that he failed to complete the plan because he insisted on working alone and refused to help each other. Obviously, the Rightists are not like this. Moreover, if it is said to be an accidental error, the woodcutter who dropped the axe and injured bystanders would immediately apologize to the injured and immediately repair the axe to avoid repeating the error, but would never feel at ease and repeat the error again and again.
　　From this it can be seen that problems such as level, method, general individualism, and accidental errors are all problems that arise in the process of working to serve socialism, and are fundamentally different from the Rightists' deliberate and painstaking attacks on the Party and socialism. The former belongs to the category of internal contradictions among the people, and the latter belongs to the category of contradictions between the enemy and ourselves.
　　We must have a correct understanding of the issue of motive. First of all, we must know that in class society, including today's transitional period, people have class nature. "In class society, people's concepts of good and evil are different: what the exploiters consider good, the exploited consider evil, and what the exploited consider evil, the exploiters consider good" (Liu Shaoqi: "The Class Nature of Man"). It is naturally impossible to clarify the discussion of whether people's motives are good or bad if it is detached from class relations. There are no abstract motives, only concrete motives. In class society, there are no motives that transcend class, but only motives with class nature. Therefore, before analyzing whether motives are good or bad, we must first see which class this person's political position belongs to. If it is the unreformed bourgeoisie, especially the bourgeois rightists, will they have good motives towards socialism? From the essence of the class, as a reactionary, it is impossible for the rightists to have good motives towards socialism, which also means bad motives towards capitalism, whether consciously or unconsciously. Therefore, it is wrong to talk about the good or bad of motives in isolation and detachment from class analysis methods. What is good for the reactionaries is necessarily bad for our working class. The same is true of the goodness or badness of motives, that is, what the rightists consider a good motive, we must consider a bad motive. Today, the rightists still insist on their "theory" of good motives and bad effects. This is not only a wrong theory of motives that transcends class, but also an attempt to cover up their crimes and excuse their guilt.
　　Secondly, to test whether a person's subjective wishes, that is, his motives, are good, we must not listen to his own statements or defenses, but look at the effects his actions have on society. Otherwise, that would mean that there is no objective standard for testing the goodness or badness of motives, which is obviously idealism. We dialectical materialists believe that "social practice and its effects are the criteria for testing subjective wishes or motives" (Mao Zedong: "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"). Although the relationship between motive and effect is not entirely causal, and is not as consistently consistent as planting melons and getting melons, planting beans and getting beans, it should be said that the two are basically consistent. The inconsistencies that exist are still intrinsically and organically related, and are by no means mutually unrelated isolated entities, and the goodness or badness of motives can be fully judged through practice and its effects. For example, if teams A and B are playing soccer, and team A loses in terms of effect, the reason is a matter of level in practice, not a crime of war. This cannot be said to be a problem with motives; or the reason is that there are shortcomings in tactics in practice, which can only be said to be a problem with methods, not a problem with motives; or the reason is that some players like to show themselves in practice and lack a spirit of collective cooperation. Although their motives are bad, it is for personal glory, but it is still not a fundamental bad motive of deliberately causing their team to fail; or the reason is an accidental error in practice, which cannot be said to be a problem with motives. However, if there is a traitor among the players who cooperates from the inside out and switches sides in practice, then there must be a problem with motives. The rightists belong to the latter. Therefore, through practice and its effects, the goodness or badness of motives can be seen in anything. Otherwise, it is bound to be agnosticism. If we test motives without regard to practice and its effects, it can only be wild speculation and fruitless efforts, and there will be no positive results. Therefore, we cannot test the motives of the rightists without regard to their specific social practice and its effects. With this, we can completely determine that their motives are bad.
　　Again, whoever opposes something must advocate something; whoever dislikes something must like something. Advocacy and liking are motives. For example, those who use the excuse of opposing dogmatism to oppose Marxism-Leninism must advocate revisionism (of course, the rightists will not use this name, but its essence must be revisionism) or some form of bourgeois ideology; those who use the excuse of opposing sectarianism to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party must advocate that people who share their smell of corruption hold power; those who use the excuse of demanding expanded "democracy and freedom" to oppose the fundamental system of socialism—democratic centralism—must advocate the realization of bourgeois democracy. That is to say, they demand to remove what they do not like and replace it with what they do like. May I ask every rightist, when he opposes or dislikes something specific, what exactly does he advocate or like in his inner thoughts? That is his specific motive. Therefore, it is impossible for the rightists to say that they have no motives, and even more impossible to say that their motives are good. The rightists say that the motive is "hating iron for not becoming steel," but in reality, this is comparing "iron" to Marxism-Leninism and its political party, to socialism, and comparing "steel" to the bourgeoisie and its political party, to capitalism. This is because, if it is really "hating iron for not becoming steel" and hoping that our cause will go further, then we would not want to destroy the "iron," but cherish it and make it refined into "steel." However, the rightists destroy the "iron" and make it impossible for the "steel" to be refined, which is fundamentally not a matter of "hating iron for not becoming steel." In any case, the motives of the rightists cannot be good.
　　In short, all rightists, like all reactionaries, have only the one-sidedness of being anti-socialist in their political attitude, hate the proletariat and the socialist road in their political stance, and it is inevitable that they will oppose the Party and socialism in their actions. As for the specific crimes of each rightist in opposing the Party and socialism, they vary in form, whether literary or military, overt or covert, in terms of entry points, whether high or low, coarse or fine, in terms of time, whether early or late, in terms of circumstances, whether light or heavy, in terms of the degree of consciousness, whether large or small, in terms of role and influence, whether deep or shallow, broad or narrow, and in terms of repentance for crimes, whether good or bad. But this cannot be used to infer that their political stance at the time of committing the crime was reactionary or not reactionary, and therefore it cannot be used to infer that among all the rightists with a reactionary political stance, some have good motives and some have bad motives. Although their subjective wishes, that is, their motives, are varied and different, their political stances are all anti-Party and anti-socialist; if their ideals can be realized, they will inevitably converge on the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, and there cannot be a third road. Therefore, we must never say that motives are good or bad because specific motives are large or small, hidden or obvious, but only say that there are bad motives and no good motives.

　　谈动机与效果
　　李正文
    反右派斗争以来，很多右派分子都在口头上说他们的效果——反党反社会主义虽坏，动机——“帮助党整风”却好。今天在处理右派时期，又出现一批“好心肠”的同志，也被右派所迷惑，说他们的动机并不坏。归纳起来，理由不外乎是：动机与效果的关系，并非种瓜得瓜、种豆得豆的因果关系，有时也不一致。比如赛足球，双方队员都想赛赢，但总有一方是输的；投考大学的学生，都想考入他所希望的学校，但总有不少人“名落孙山”；科学研究者，都想做出一些惊人的发明来，但不少人失败了。因此，右派的效果坏，并不一定就证明他们的动机也坏。那是由于水平低，方法不对头，个人主义，或偶然过失，“本来是用力劈柴，而斧头脱落，伤及旁观者”。
    这种动机与效果的关系的说法，套用在右派身上是完全错误的。试看，右派分子张牙舞爪地攻击马克思列宁主义，无所不用其极地丑化共产党的领导，要求资产阶级的民主自由而反对社会主义的根本制度。他们对于资本主义那样欣赏，对于社会主义这样仇恨，这能说只是一般思想作风问题么？就拿右派分子喜欢举的例子来看吧。例如，赛足球赛输了，投考学生未被录取，科学研究者试验失败，这样的情况当然是有的，但是与右派分子的反党反社会主义相比，是不伦不类的。如果一定要比，那末右派分子的反党反社会主义罪行，却像一个足球队员不向对方球门射球，而老是里应外合，向自己的球门射球；右派分子也像一个投考学生答卷时不是尽自己所能，而是大笔一挥，“淋漓尽致”地谩骂一通高等学校；右派分子也像一个科学研究者不是尽最大的努力试验，而是毁掉试验品。这种失败能说是由于水平不高、方法错误或偶然过失么？显然，这都不是。如果说是水平问题，那只能对足球队员说是屡扣对方的球门而未中，对投考学生说是绞尽脑汁还是不得不交白卷，对科学研究者说是认真负责而屡试未果。如果说是方法问题，那只能对足球队员说是因战术上有缺陷而败北，对投考学生说是因违反考试规则而落选，对科学研究者说是因试验方法错误而走了弯路。如果说是单纯的个人主义问题，那只能对足球队员说是因个人喜欢出风头、连络不好而招致失败；对投考学生说是因标新立异、弄巧成拙而招致落第；对科学研究者说是因坚持单干、拒绝互助而未能完成计划。显然，右派分子不是这样。并且，如果说是偶然过失，对于脱落斧头而伤及旁观者的劈柴者说，会立即向伤者表示歉意，并会立即修理斧子，以免重复这一过失，而决不会心安理得，并且一犯再犯。
    由此可见，水平、方法、一般个人主义和偶然过失等问题，都是在为社会主义服务的工作过程中出现的毛病，与右派分子处心积虑、千方百计地向党和向社会主义进攻，有着根本性质的不同。前者属于人民内部的范畴，后者属于敌我的范畴。
    我们对于动机问题，必须有一个正确的认识。首先要知道，在阶级社会中，包括今天的过渡时期，人是具有阶级性的。“在阶级社会中，人们的善恶观念就各有不同：剥削者认为善的，被剥削者认为恶，被剥削者认为恶的，剥削者认为善”（刘少奇同志：“人的阶级性”）。离开阶级关系而来讨论人们的动机好坏，自然闹不清楚。没有抽象的动机，只有具体的动机。在阶级社会里没有什么超阶级的动机，而只有带着阶级性的动机。所以，我们在分析动机好坏之前，首先要看这个人的政治立场是属于哪个阶级的。如果是未经改造的资产阶级，特别是资产阶级右派分子，对社会主义会不会有好动机？从阶级本质说，作为反动派的右派分子对社会主义有好动机，从而也就是对资本主义有坏动机，这不管是自觉还是不自觉，都是决不可能的。所以，脱离阶级分析方法来孤立地空谈动机好坏，这是错误的。对反动派好的，必然对我们工人阶级是坏的。关于动机的好坏，也正是如此，即右派分子认为是好动机，我们必然认为是坏动机。今天右派分子仍坚持他们是动机好、效果坏的“理论”，这不仅是错误的超阶级的动机论，而且是企图掩饰自己的罪行，开脱自己的罪责。
    其次，检验一个人的主观愿望即其动机是否善良，不是听他自己的声明或辩解，而是看他的行动在社会中产生的效果。否则，那就是说，动机的好坏是没有检验的客观标准了，显然这是唯心主义。我们辩证唯物主义者认为“社会实践及其效果是检验主观愿望或动机的标准”（毛主席：“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）。虽然动机与效果的关系并非完全是因果关系，并不像种瓜得瓜、种豆得豆那样经常一致，但是应当说二者基本上一致。其不一致的，也毕竟还是有内在的、有机的联系，而决不是互不相关的孤立存在的事物，也完全可以通过实践及其效果来判断动机的好坏。比如，甲乙两队赛足球，甲队在效果上输了，原因是实践上的水平问题，非战之罪，这就不能说动机有问题；或者原因是实践上的战术有缺点，这只能说是方法有问题，而非动机有问题；或者原因是队员中有人在实践上好表现自己，缺乏集体合作精神，其动机虽坏，是为了个人出风头，但仍非有志在本队败北的根本性的坏动机；或者原因是实践上的偶然过失，这不能说动机有问题。但是，如果队员中有一叛徒，在实践上里应外合，倒戈踢球，那就必然是动机有问题了。右派就是属于后者。所以，通过实践及其效果，任何事物都能看出动机的好坏来的，否则，必然是不可知论。如果离开实践及其效果来检验动机，那只能是胡猜乱想，缘木求鱼，不会有任何积极结果的。因此，我们检验右派分子的动机，就不能脱离他的具体社会实践及其效果，借此完全可以断定他们的动机是坏的。
    再次，凡有所反对的，就必有所主张；凡有所讨厌的，就必有所喜欢。主张和喜欢就是动机。比如，借口反对教条主义来反对马克思列宁主义的，就必然主张修正主义（自然右派分子不会用这个名称，但其实质一定是修正主义）或什么形式的资产阶级思想体系；借口反对宗派主义来反对共产党的领导，就必然主张与他臭味相投的人们掌握大权；借口要求扩大“民主自由”来反对社会主义的根本制度——民主集中制的，就必然主张实现资产阶级的民主。这就是说，他们要求去掉他们所不喜欢的，而换上他们所喜欢的。试问每一个右派分子，当他反对或讨厌什么具体东西的时候，在思想深处究竟主张或喜欢什么？那就是他的具体动机。因此，右派分子不可能说没有动机，更不可能说动机是好的。右派分子说，动机是“恨铁不成钢”，实际上这是把“铁”比作马克思列宁主义及其政党，比作社会主义，而把“钢”比作资产阶级及其政党，比作资本主义。这是因为，假如真是“恨铁不成钢”，希望我们的事业百尺竿头更进一步，那就不是想把“铁”毁弃，而是加以爱护，使之炼成“钢”，但是右派分子却是毁弃“铁”而使“钢”炼不成，这就根本不是什么“恨铁不成钢”的问题了。无论如何，右派分子的动机不可能是好的。
    总之，所有的右派分子正如所有的反动派一样，在政治态度上只有反社会主义的一面性，在政治立场上仇视无产阶级和社会主义道路，在行动上反党反社会主义是必然的。至于每个右派分子的具体反党反社会主义的罪行，则在形式上有文有武、有明有暗，在入手的方面有上有下、有粗有细，在时间上有先有后，在情节上有轻有重，在自觉程度上有大有小，在作用和影响上有深有浅、有广有狭，在对罪行的悔改上有好有坏，但这都不能因此而推断他们犯罪时的政治立场有反动有不反动，从而也不能推断具有反动政治立场的所有右派分子中有人动机好有人动机坏。尽管他们的主观愿望，即其动机各式各样，有所不同，但他们的政治立场都是反党反社会主义的；如能按他们的理想实现的话，必然殊途同归于半殖民地半封建的旧中国，不可能有什么第三条道路。因此，决不能因具体动机有大有小、有隐有显而就说动机有好有坏，只能说有坏无好。
