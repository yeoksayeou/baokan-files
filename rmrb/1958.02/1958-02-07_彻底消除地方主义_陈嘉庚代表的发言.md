　　Thoroughly Eliminate Localism
　　Speech by Delegate Chen Jiageng
　　I have listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Director of the Written Language Reform Committee Wu Yuzhang's "Report on the Current Work of Written Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Plan," and I fully agree with them all.

　　Last year, it was reported that several right-wing elements in Zhejiang, who had violated the socialist trend of localism, were expelled from the Party. From what I have heard and seen, this situation exists in many other provinces as well, not just Zhejiang. Even those who are not right-wing are often heavily tainted with local colors. Local colors collude with right-wing elements to rise and gradually become a force, controlling everything. This rectification campaign, with its "big blooming and big contending," has already exposed the crimes of the right-wing elements. After denouncing and correcting them, all localist practices should also be thoroughly eradicated. Especially those in leading positions, whose every move affects the orientation of the masses of the people, how can they not follow the socialist path and instead lean towards the right? I recall a conversation with Premier Zhou some years ago, when we discussed localism in Fujian Province. Premier Zhou said that many other provinces also have this problem. They seem to have reasons and justifications on the surface, but in reality, they often make excuses based on objective conditions as a smokescreen. This is how right-wing elements deceive people.

　　The Engineering College of Xiamen University, with its many years of history, was once adjusted and closed, with its 600 students merged into other provinces. The Fujian Maritime Vocational School, established in Jimei for less than a year, was also closed, with its 200 students merged into Dalian Maritime Institute. As a result, the institute has not admitted a single student from Fujian Province for several years. The major of nautical studies should absorb more children of coastal fishing and shipping workers. During my inspection of the institute in 1955, the former students of the Maritime Vocational School had mostly graduated. In that year, 300 students were admitted, none of whom were from Fujian. This emphasis on the latter and disregard for the former is precisely a manifestation of localism.

　　The Jimei Commercial School, founded more than 30 years ago, continued to operate even when it moved inland during the War of Resistance. After liberation, it was renamed Finance and Economics, with 600 students. At the same time, the provincial commercial school in Fuzhou had only 500 students. However, in 1954, the Education Department unilaterally stopped admitting new students to Jimei Finance and Economics, while the provincial commercial school continued to enroll as usual. Later, due to the government's expansion of technical education, I wrote to Premier Zhou in the autumn of 1956, requesting the reopening of finance and economics classes, with a plan to recruit 600 new students. However, when the approved order arrived at the provincial department, I was unaware of it. It was not until I went to Beijing in June that I learned of this matter. By then, the examination period was imminent, so I hurriedly prepared everything. Last year, for the second time in the autumn, I planned to recruit 600 new students. Thousands of poor students who had graduated from junior high schools in southern Fujian hoped to take the exam. However, the provincial department and the principal of the provincial commercial school suddenly came to Jimei and told me not to recruit new students. They planned to move 640 students from the provincial commercial school to Jimei and let Jimei Finance and Economics manage them uniformly. The provincial commercial school would then be converted into a cadre training class. At that time, I was quite worried about causing disappointment among the students, but I did not want to hinder the province's established plan, so I reluctantly agreed. However, after the examination period had passed, the provincial department suddenly sent a message saying that the students of the provincial commercial school were unwilling to move to Jimei and suggested that cadre students could be recruited by Finance and Economics to offset the number as internal enrollment. By mid-October, only 400 cadre students had enrolled. Later, it was found that there was no such thing as the students of the provincial commercial school being unwilling to come to Jimei. In fact, it was because a small number of teachers in Fuzhou were unwilling to travel far, so they used this as an excuse. Southern Fujian has more mountains and less farmland, accounting for eight out of the old administrative regions; and five-sixths out of thirteen of the province's population. In the past, they often relied on going overseas to make a living. Since the two world wars, it has been difficult to go abroad, and coupled with its proximity to the front line, the people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult; the children of overseas Chinese returning to China are also increasingly impoverished. Therefore, only secondary technical schools with tuition and boarding fee exemptions can solve their problem of further education. However, there are very few technical schools like Finance and Economics in southern Fujian, and they were stopped from recruiting students, preventing them from entering. As for the provincial capital of northern Fujian, there are more higher and secondary technical schools, with tens of thousands of free students. Why is there such a disparity? This is the ingrained habit of localism, which has accumulated over time. This is a well-known fact.

　　The mineral deposits in Fujian Province are less abundant in northern Fujian than in southwestern Fujian. After liberation, it was planned to build a railway. After detailed consideration and decision by the relevant departments, Chairman Mao told me that it would start from Xiangtang, pass through Ruijin and Longyan, and end at Xiamen, a total of more than 800 kilometers. Later, I don't know how the plan was changed to start from Yingtan, pass through northern Fujian, and end at Xiamen, a total of more than 600 kilometers. The route does not seem to pass through any famous mineral areas, and the most miscalculated thing is that the route from Yong'an and above in the high mountain area descending into the southwestern Fujian boundary all spirals in the valleys lower than the bottom of the Jiulong River. The Jiulong River is the main stream of southwestern Fujian, with high mountains connected on the left and right, and very few fields and residential areas. If hydropower is built by utilizing the terrain, it is said that 300,000 to 400,000 kilowatts can be obtained, the project is not large, and the loss to residents is very small; it is also very close to the industry and agriculture in southwestern Fujian and other places; it can be said that the conditions are the best, and it is related to the well-being of 8 million people. There are very few such terrains in the provinces of South China, but they are abandoned and not considered, and the area is designated as a railway line. As for the railway in northern Fujian, such as the Nanfu Railway, the roadbed also runs along the river, but the location is on the high mountains. Why is the same railway plan so different before and after? The reason is also the localist point of view at work. Localism has a narrow mind and can never do great things. Is this a social obstacle?

　　The main value of the Yingxia Railway lies in its terminal being close to the sea. There are three wharfs of different sizes, the largest being in Songyu, where giant ships of 320,000 tons can dock; the second largest is Xiamen Port, where ships of 10,000 tons can dock; and the third largest is Jimei, where ships of several thousand tons can also dock. I have already mentioned this in my proposal at the last National People's Congress, but there has been no response since then. Now the tracks only pass through Jimei, and the other two have not yet been laid. Moreover, no stations have been set up in any of the three places, only a general station has been set up in Wucun on the outskirts of the city. Jimei is the mainland terminal, 15 kilometers away from Wucun. The population of Xiamen Island is only 200,000, and 70% to 80% of the goods, excluding exports, must be transferred to the interior. If a station is set up in Jimei, the goods for domestic sales can be loaded and unloaded in Jimei, without having to be transported to Xiamen, so as to avoid the loss of the 30 kilometers of round-trip transfer and handling. Some say that Jimei is a small place and not enough to set up a freight station. This is talking without knowing the terrain. Just look at the many kilometers of beach exposed on both sides of Jimei at low tide, and filling it up by only two meters will turn it into land; and the soil is extremely easy to transport from the nearby mountains that are five or six meters high; with this condition, coupled with transformation and construction, what if a small place does not become a large place? I recently heard that the Yingxia Railway will soon hold a formal establishment ceremony. I don't know what the meaning of this is? If it is to commemorate the opening of the railway, it has been open to traffic for many years; if it is to commemorate the completion, the three main stations and wharfs have not yet started construction. I think that after the millions of people sang praises of the opening of the Yingxia Railway last year, they never expected that this "failure to carry through to the end" tail would be left until today, which is inevitable regret. However, localists never wholeheartedly seek the interests of the people of southern Fujian, they are absent-minded, turn a blind eye, and how can they have the same feeling?

### 彻底消除地方主义  陈嘉庚代表的发言

　　彻底消除地方主义
    陈嘉庚代表的发言
    我听了李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”和文字改革委员会主任吴玉章“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，均完全同意。
    去年报载浙江有违背社会主义倾向地方主义的右派分子多人，开除党籍。以我所闻所见，具此情形者，其他省份亦大有人，不但浙省而已；即非右派，而浓厚沾染地方色彩者亦多有之。地方色彩由与右派相勾结而抬头，渐成势力，把持一切。这次整风运动，大鸣大放既已暴露右派分子的罪恶，加以申讨纠正，则举凡地方主义作风，亦应予以彻底革除。尤其是身居主管地位者，一举一动关系人民大众所趋向，那能够不循社会主义的正轨，而偏近右倾呢？回忆前年与周总理谈话，论及闽省地方主义，周总理谓他省亦多此弊。他们表面说来，似乎持之有故，言之成理，而实际每多推诿客观，借为烟幕，右派分子的欺人大都如是。
    厦门大学工学院，已有多年历史，一旦调整停办，将学生六百人合并他省。福建航专学校在集美开办不及一年，即行停办，将学生二百人并入大连海运学院。致数年来该学院未吸收一个闽省学生。学习航海专业应该多吸收沿海渔航业子弟，乃一九五五年我视察该院时，前航专学生多已毕业去，是年招生三百名，闽籍学生无一名，重彼轻此，这正是地方主义的表现。
    集美商业学校创办三十余年，抗战时迁内地未尝停止，解放后改名财经，有学生六百名。同时在福州的省立商业学校只有学生五百名，乃教育厅于一九五四年片面停招集美财经新生，而省商则赓续招生办理如故。后我因政府扩大技术教育，函请周总理于一九五六年秋季复开财经班级，拟招新生六百名。乃邀准的电令到达省厅时，我竟无所闻知。至六月间到京方知此事。那时距离招考时期已迫，乃急筹备一切，去年第二次秋季拟招生六百名，闽南初中毕业贫苦学生千百人盼望投考，而省厅及省商校长忽来集，告我勿招新生，拟将省商学生六百四十名移并集美，以后由集美财经统一办理，省商则改办干部训练班云云。当时我颇顾虑引起学生失望，但又不好阻碍省方既定的计划，故勉强予以同意。乃考期已过，省厅忽又寄声来告，省商学生不愿移集，可由财经招干部学生抵额作为内部招生。至十月半，干部新生入校者才四百名。后查省商学生不愿来集，并无此事。实因少数福州教员不愿远行，故以此托词搪塞。闽南山多田少，于旧行政区八居其二；于全省人口，居十三分之五六。过去常靠渡洋谋生，自两次世界大战后出国艰难，兼以地近前线，民生愈益困苦；其子弟及归国侨生贫苦者亦日多。故惟中等技术学校有免学膳费待遇者才能解决彼等升学问题。但技术学校如财经者求之闽南不及一二，竟被停止招生，使彼等不得其门而入。至于闽北省垣则高等及中等技术学校较多，免费学生数以万计。为什么畸轻畸重至于如此？那是地方主义故习，积重难返，有以致之。是为路人皆知的事实。
    闽省矿产，闽北蕴藏量少于闽西南，解放后拟造铁路，经有关部门详细考虑决定后，毛主席告我系由向塘起点，经瑞金、龙岩，至厦门八百余公里。后不知如何变更计划，改为由鹰潭经闽北至厦门六百余公里。线路经过不闻有何矿产名区，而最为失计者就是铁路自永安以上高山地区下降入闽西南界内的路线，均盘旋于较低于九龙江江底的山谷中。九龙江为闽西南主流，左右高山连接，田园民居甚少。若利用地势建设水电，闻可得三四十万瓩，工程不大，居民损失甚微；通达闽西南等处工农业亦甚接近；可谓条件最佳，诚八百万人民休戚荣枯所关系，华南各省，若此地形甚少，而乃舍弃不图，划其地区为铁路线。至于闽北铁路，如南福铁路路基亦沿江而行，但位置是在高山之上。同一铁路计划，何为前后相反不同如此。其原因也是地方主义的观点在作祟。地方主义心地狭隘，决不能干大业。这是否社会的障碍。
    鹰厦铁路主要价值，在于终点近海。大小码头三处，最大的在嵩屿，三二万吨巨舰可以泊岸；其次为厦门港，可泊万吨的船；再次为集美，亦可停数千吨的船舶。我已于上次全国人民代表会议提案上提到此说，过后不见返响。现在路轨只经过集美，其余二处还未铺及。而且三处均未设站，惟在市郊吴村设一总站而已，集美为大陆终点，距吴村十五公里，厦岛人口不过二十万，货物除外销外，十之七八须转运内陆。若集美设站，则内销之货可在集美起卸，无须运往厦门，以免多费来往三十公里转折盘运的损失。或说集美是个小地方，不敷设立货站，这是不熟悉地势的说话。只要退潮时看看集美两边海滩露出的有许多公里，把它填高不过二公尺，即成陆地；而附近山地高五六公尺运土极为容易；有此条件，加以改造建设，那怕小地方不变作大地方？近闻鹰厦铁路不久将举行正式成立典礼，我不知其意义何在？若论纪念通车，则通行业已经年；若论纪念完成，则三处主要车站码头尚未开始建造。我想千百万人民在去年歌诵鹰厦通车之后想不到竟留此“功亏一篑”的尾巴直至今天，未免抱憾。但地方主义者未尝全心全意为闽南人民谋利益，心不在焉，熟视无睹，又那有同样的感觉呢？
