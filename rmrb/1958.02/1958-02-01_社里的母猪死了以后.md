The dispute between my Second Brother and Brother-in-law Liu was a worry to everyone in our village; even the children playing together could spark a shouting match. Speaking of the reason, it was a very common thing:

	Second Brother was the son of Third Uncle, and Brother-in-law Liu was the son-in-law of Grandfather (Father's elder brother). Grandfather had no sons, only one daughter. According to old customs, this "family property" should be inherited by Second Brother. The problem arose here: after Sister Liu married, Grandfather and Grandmother felt lonely. Should they bring Second Brother over? The old couple were still afraid of future arguments about favoring their daughter, and Brother-in-law Liu's family was also not well-off, so after some discussion, they moved the young couple in. When Second Brother saw Brother-in-law Liu coming, he became unhappy, constantly finding fault. Sister Liu had been raised by Grandmother and couldn't stand this kind of "rough treatment." When Second Brother scolded, she would come out and make a scene. One thing led to another, and this dispute took shape. Brother-in-law Liu was an honest man and had wanted to move back several times, but Grandmother and Sister Liu stubbornly refused.

	This matter was unresolved even after the establishment of the agricultural cooperative. The two families lived only a wall apart. One wanted to go to the East Team, and the other wanted to go to the West Team. To avoid further conflicts, the cooperative agreed. Although the arguments lessened, they were still not on good terms. Last spring, when Grandmother was ill, Second Brother didn't even go to visit her.

	This place is close to Weishan Lake, a good place for raising pigs. In the year the cooperative was established, they bought over forty pigs at once. In one year, nearly two hundred piglets were born. Seeing the success in pig farming, the county also awarded two "Yorkshire" boars as studs.

	With more pigs in the cooperative, each team was assigned a litter to raise. Coincidentally, Second Brother was made the pig farm's feeder in the East Team, and Brother-in-law Liu was made the pig farm's feeder in the West Team. No one suggested a competition between them, but both secretly worked harder. Big ones gave birth to small ones, and small ones gave birth to smaller ones. In one year, each team had six or seventy pigs.

	After the promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, the comrades in the cooperative, in accordance with the great leap forward in agricultural production, formulated a plan to develop pigs. The entire cooperative was required to reach two pigs per household by the end of 1958. Once the plan was communicated, both Second Brother and Brother-in-law Liu told their production team leaders that they could do it.

	On the evening of the day the plan was announced, Second Brother was in the pigsty, murmuring to the old sow about to give birth, just as he always did: "I'll add more firewood for you to keep you warm. Give birth to more piglets so we can achieve the plan early." Brother-in-law Liu also worked harder than usual, blocking all the holes in the pigsty door with firewood. He would come to check on the pregnant sow two or three times during the cold night. The villagers looked forward to the piglets as much as they looked forward to their firstborn sons. Many villagers even prepared nests for the piglets!

	Early in the month, the good days arrived. The sows in both teams gave birth within two days of each other. The sow fed by Second Brother gave birth to sixteen, and the sow fed by Brother-in-law Liu gave birth to fifteen. It was truly delightful. Uncle Zhenlu, the cooperative director, said: "These two feeders are really capable; they both achieved the plan ahead of schedule."

	However, the old sow fed by Second Brother fell ill the day after giving birth to the piglets. The livestock veterinarian prescribed two kinds of medicine, but they didn't work. It died after three days. This matter was truly the most difficult thing for Second Brother to bear in his life. Two pigs per household! Achieving the plan ahead of schedule! It was all over! More importantly, he had fallen behind Brother-in-law Liu, how heartbreaking!

	In the evening, the director came and said to Second Brother kindly, "Xiao Er, don't be sad. People also have unexpected disasters. Take good care of the pigs that are still alive." Second Brother didn't say anything, just hung his head sadly. The director looked at the piglets that hadn't even opened their eyes yet, sighed deeply, and went to Brother-in-law Liu's pigsty.

	Brother-in-law Liu was covered in mud and water as he wiped the piglets. The director looked at them and said intentionally or unintentionally: "These piglets are about the same size as Xiao Er's, all very delightful..." Brother-in-law Liu, as usual, just "hmmed" whatever others said. In fact, the director had come with a purpose, which was to have Brother-in-law Liu's sow nurse the orphaned piglets, but when he saw Brother-in-law Liu's attitude, he immediately remembered their dispute, and left without mentioning the matter.

	Brother-in-law Liu finished arranging the piglets and went home.

	Brother-in-law Liu knew that Second Brother's sow had died, but he hadn't thought about the issue of surrogate nursing. As usual, he took off his robe after returning home and fell asleep in his cotton-padded jacket and trousers. He didn't know why, but he kept tossing and turning, unable to sleep, as if Second Brother's dozen or so piglets were crying beside him. "The piglets can't be without milk; can't children who lack milk find wet nurses?" Brother-in-law Liu sat up suddenly; but then he thought again: they haven't spoken to each other for almost ten years, how can I open my mouth? He lay back down. But the problem of the piglets was impossible to push out of his mind, and besides, these pigs all belonged to the villagers!

	It was midnight when Brother-in-law Liu came to Second Brother's pigsty. The stars were dense, and the night wind was biting. Second Brother was panting heavily. Brother-in-law Liu pushed open the wooden gate and went in. Second Brother just raised his head and looked at him, then lowered it again.

	Brother-in-law Liu walked to the piglets, poked at the firewood, and turned the piglets over. When Second Brother saw Brother-in-law Liu handling the piglets, he jumped up: "What are you doing? Are you bringing a child who isn't crying to joke with me? You think it died late enough, smash them, smash them to death and then you'll be number one!" Brother-in-law Liu stood there blankly for a while, then said: "I was thinking of letting my sow be a surrogate. Who could bear to be so cruel..."

	Second Brother was stunned when he heard this. He stood there motionless with his hands hanging straight down until Brother-in-law Liu carried the piglets out. He then followed, chasing after him, saying, "Brother-in-law Liu! Brother-in-law Liu! I'll help you take them there."

	This form of address was also a first in more than ten years, and it was also in the cold winter night...

	Three days later, the partition wall between their two courtyards was torn down.

　　社里的母猪死了以后
　　董尧
    二哥和刘姐夫的纠纷，我们村上无人不担心，两家的孩子在一起玩也能引起骂仗。说起来因为啥，事情很平常：
    二哥是三叔的儿子，刘姐夫是大爷（伯父）的女婿。大爷没有儿子，就一个闺女，按照老习惯这份“家当”应该由二哥领。事情就出在这上面：刘姐姐出嫁后，大爷、大娘都感到寂寞，把二哥要来吧？老俩口子还怕以后疼闺女有口舌，加上刘姐夫家生活也不好，一商议就把他们小俩口搬来了。二哥一看刘姐夫来了，心中就不高兴，终天比鸡骂狗的，刘姐姐是大娘把着长大的，哪儿能吃得下这碗“杂面”，二哥一骂，她就出来闹，一而两、两而三的，这个纠纷就结起来了。刘姐夫是个老实人，曾经几次要挪回去，大娘和刘姐姐都是顶着不肯挪。
    这件事直到成立农业社还没了，两家住的只隔一道墙，一个要到东队，一个要到西队，为了不再闹仗，社里也就同意了。闹仗的事虽然少了，可仍然是不和，去年春天，大娘有病，二哥都没过去看一看。
    这里紧靠微山湖，是养猪的好地方，合作社成立的当年，一气就买了四十多个猪，一年的工夫光小猪就生了近二百头，县里看养猪有成绩，还奖给两头“育克夏”公猪种。
    社里猪多了，每个队分一窝喂养，说来又巧，东队让二哥当了养猪饲养员；西队让刘姐夫当了养猪饲养员。谁也没有提出让他们比赛，可是两头都暗自加起劲来了。大生小，小再生小，一年工夫每队都有六、七十头了。
    农业发展纲要修正草案公布后，社里的同志按照农业生产大跃进，订出了发展毛猪的计划，全社要求到1958年年底达到每户两头。规划一传达，二哥和刘姐夫都向他们的生产队长表示能办到。
    规划公布后的当天晚上，二哥在猪圈里对着那只快要生小猪的老母猪，又像往天一样的咕噥开了：“我给你多加把柴，暖和暖和，多生小猪好早实现计划。”刘姐夫也比往常加工了，猪圈门的漏洞全用柴草堵了起来，这么冷的夜总是两次三次来看看快要生育的大母猪。社员们盼小猪也像盼头生子一样，不少社员都为小猪准备好了窝呢！
    月初，好日子盼到了，前后两天内两个队的母猪全生了，二哥喂的母猪生十六个，刘姐夫喂的母猪生十五个。真是喜人，社长振露叔就说：这两个饲养员真行，都提前实现了计划。
    可是，二哥喂的老母猪，在生下小猪的第二天就病倒了，畜牧兽医技术员给开了两种药，吃了也不顶事。前后三天，它竟死了。这件事对二哥说来，真是一辈子最难过的，每户两头猪呀！提前实现规划呀！啥都完了！更重要的是落在刘姐夫后面了，多伤心呀！
    晚上，社长来了，他亲切地对二哥说：“小二，别伤心，人还有当时的灾难哩，好好的喂养活着的猪吧。”二哥没有讲什么，只是难过的垂着头。社长看了看这些还没睁开眼的猪娃，长叹了一声，就奔刘姐夫的猪圈走去。
    刘姐夫正泥一把水一把的擦弄着小猪，社长看了看，又有意无意的说：“这些小猪和小二的差不多大，都满喜人……。”刘姐夫和往常一样，别人管说什么只是“哼”着。其实社长是有心事来的，那就是想让刘姐夫的母猪给代奶，可是他一看刘姐夫这股劲，立刻又想起他们的纠纷，事情没提就走了。
    刘姐夫把小猪摆弄好，就回家去了。
    二哥的母猪死了，刘姐夫知道，至于代奶的问题，他却没有想到。和往常一样，回家后把袍子一脱，穿着棉袄、棉裤就睡倒了。也不知怎么的，总是翻来复去睡不着，好像二哥的十几头小猪就在他身边叫。“小猪不能没有奶；缺奶的孩子不是可以找奶娘吗？”刘姐夫一轱辘坐了起来；但又一转念：不答腔快十年了，怎么张口呀？他又睡了下去。可是小猪的问题怎么也不好推到脑子外去，而且，这些猪全是社员的呀！
    刘姐夫到二哥猪圈来的时候，都半夜了，星星密密的，夜风刺骨。二哥正粗一阵、细一阵的喘着气。刘姐夫推开木棒门进去了，二哥只是抬一抬头，望了望他，又低了下来。
    刘姐夫走到小猪跟前，扒了扒柴草，把小猪翻了翻。二哥一看刘姐夫摆弄小猪，跳起来了：“你干啥？你抱着不哭的孩子到这里来和我开玩笑？你看死的晚，摔呀，摔死完了你就数第一了！”刘姐夫呆呆的站了一阵子，然后说：“我是想让俺那母猪代奶的。谁还能下那份狠心……。”
    二哥一听怔住了，他两手直垂地站在那里一动不动，直到刘姐夫把小猪兜了出去，他才随后追着说：“刘姐夫！刘姐夫！我帮你送去。”
    就这个称呼，十多年来也是第一次，而且又是在寒冬的深夜。……
    三天后，他两家院当中的隔墙就打通了。
