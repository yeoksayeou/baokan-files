Cadre "Three-izations"
By Our Correspondent Zhang Wei

During the rectification campaign, the workers of Hankou Jiang'an Railway Station put forward 6,401 opinions. The station leaders immediately resolved more than 90% of these opinions; however, they only paid attention to handling them one by one, and did not fundamentally improve the leadership style, which is closely related to all problems. Therefore, the workers still lacked confidence in future improvements. Many people reflected: "Judging from the numbers, the leadership has made quite a few changes; however, the leadership style has not improved." Many people continued to criticize the leadership style, saying that they do not go deep into the lower levels, do not understand the workers' situation, and demanded that the leaders step out of the office and visit the workers' homes and production teams.

The station Party committee decided to accept the criticism from the masses, and organized 94 Party and government staff members, including the Party committee secretary, station master, and chairman of the trade union, to have heart-to-heart talks with 319 workers in their homes.

One evening, Yan Qixiang, deputy secretary of the Party committee, went to visit Huang Mingzhi, a track inspector. At that time, he did not know Huang Mingzhi, so he first went to the home of an old worker to inquire about Huang Mingzhi's address. It happened that Huang Mingzhi lived in the next room. When he heard Secretary Yan was looking for him, he closed his door. Yan Qixiang saw this and knew that Huang Mingzhi was not very welcoming. Should he go or not? After thinking about it, he pretended as if nothing had happened and knocked on Huang Mingzhi's door. He took the initiative to talk to Huang Mingzhi about family, children, and other aspects of life. Huang Mingzhi answered each question but was unwilling to talk more. Yan Qixiang sincerely reviewed the past leadership work, saying that they did not go deep enough and did not actively approach the masses, so they did not understand many situations. He expressed his determination to improve drastically and solicited Huang Mingzhi's opinions on production, life, and other aspects. Huang Mingzhi was very moved and told him what had been on his mind for several years.

It turned out that in 1955, after he brought his wife to live with him, he had great financial difficulties. He went to the trade union to borrow money, but the trade union did not lend it to him, and he had a quarrel with the comrades in the trade union. Afterwards, he borrowed money from others and paid interest every month, which further increased his difficulties. However, the leadership had never come to ask about it. In 1952, he had applied to join the Party, but no one had come to talk to him either. Therefore, he was very discouraged: "If you don't care about me, I won't care about you. If you think I'm backward, then I'll be backward." He had not been very motivated in production. In addition, he also reflected that some young workers had lax labor discipline. They slept during their shifts, and the leaders did not interfere. He believed that this situation should be improved quickly. Yan Qixiang carefully noted down his opinions, saying that he would improve them separately. He explained some individual matters to him. They talked for more than three hours. When Yan Qixiang was about to leave, Huang Mingzhi saw him off and said: "This is the first time in six years that I have talked to a leader from the bottom of my heart. I am very happy. I will definitely do a good job in the future." Since his estrangement from the leaders was eliminated, his work enthusiasm greatly increased. At the end of 1957, because he had always insisted on implementing the system in track maintenance, laying a good foundation for the next shift, he became the best in the station in track maintenance and received an award.

Jiang Zonglin, chairman of the trade union, used to be the least approachable to the workers and had hardly ever visited the workers' homes. Therefore, the masses had the most opinions about him during the rectification campaign. This time, in addition to publicly reviewing himself to the masses, he also personally visited the homes of old workers such as Bai Jinxiang and Zhan Juntu to review his shortcomings in work style. Bai Jinxiang and Zhan Juntu were very happy to see the chairman of the trade union come to their homes, and they told him everything that was on their minds. Bai Jinxiang even told Jiang Zonglin that he did not agree with a certain young worker dating his daughter and mistakenly thought that the young worker was retaliating against him. Zhan Juntu's wife specially made two bowls of noodles and insisted that Jiang Zonglin eat them before he left. Recently, when Jiang Zonglin went to the home of Zheng Guanqin, an old switchman, to talk to him, Zheng Guanqin excitedly said: "To catch up with Britain in fifteen years, in my opinion, we have to do three things: first, we must complete the production tasks; second, we must ensure safety; and third, we must pay attention to conservation. The most important thing for me, a switchman, is to ensure safety. I guarantee that there will be no accidents in my life." Qu Zuomin, deputy station master, and Song Zhizhou, deputy station master for business, who are not Party members, also actively changed their work style, went to the homes of workers who lived far away to talk to them, and listened to their opinions.

Now, going deep into the workers' dormitories has become a habit for them. The chairman of the trade union and some Party committee secretaries live in the workers' dormitories and often use the time after meals or in the evening to visit the homes of workers who live scattered.

The leaders of Jiang'an Railway Station also went deep into production to learn production experience from the workers. They used their Sundays to work as weighers, patrolmen, freight bill carriers, service personnel, and car number clerks, from the morning 7:20 roll call to the evening 9:00 shift handover, participating in the entire day shift production.

On the first day of participating in production, Liu Jizhang, the station master, wore a red armband and served as a patrolman at the entrance of the freight yard, responsible for checking the documents of vehicles entering and leaving. He was busy all day, checking the documents of hundreds of vehicles. At noon, his family sent food to the freight yard, and he didn't have time to eat until after 1:00 p.m. At this time, he was not careful, and two trucks drove into the freight yard. He ran to the vehicles, shouting and asking for their documents, and found that these two trucks were going to another freight yard to haul coal, but mistakenly ran to the station's freight yard to haul coal. He quickly sent the two trucks away, avoiding a loss due to incorrect cargo transport (if the shipper's goods are short, the station should compensate). This incident deeply educated Liu Jizhang. Originally, Liu Jizhang did not pay attention to the work of the patrolman. He said: The patrolman is just guarding the vehicles entering and leaving the freight yard, what is so important? Therefore, when the patrolman asked the leadership to install a telephone for them because the freight yard was too far from the freight office, and it was not easy to contact them if problems occurred, he flatly refused. Now, he personally experienced the importance of the patrolman's responsibility, and immediately ordered people to install a telephone in the freight yard, and paid attention to arranging the work of the patrolman properly.

Jiang Zonglin, the chairman of the trade union, did not understand the business originally. Sometimes when he talked to the workers, he often said unprofessional things, and the workers laughed at him. Since the rectification campaign, after he went down and served as a weigher and other positions for several times, he understood the operation process such as loading and unloading, and some business names. He said: "Now when I arrange work, I also have the capital to make requests to the workers."

In the process of working with the workers, they paid attention to discovering and solving problems at any time. They found that there were many cases of not following the system in the handover of shifts and the loading and unloading of goods in various teams, and the cooperation between various departments was not good enough. They all took corresponding measures in time to solve them. Jiang Zonglin found that the warehouse put 666 powder and red dates and brown sugar together. Yan Qixiang, deputy secretary of the Party committee, found that explosives and cotton were piled together in the dangerous goods warehouse. They criticized the leaders of the freight department and immediately corrected them.

They changed the past practice of calling people to report as soon as they got off the train, listening to the report and leaving. They paid attention to grasping the key problems of production at any time, went to the teams to solicit the opinions of the workers, and improved their work. In November last year, after the Yangtze River Bridge was opened to traffic, the number of freight cars going to and from Jiang'an Railway Station suddenly increased from more than 70 trains to more than 100 trains per day. The tasks suddenly increased, and they couldn't cope with it for a while. The vehicles could not be scheduled, the freight yard was blocked, the production fell into chaos, and the tasks could not be completed. The station leaders then went deep into the various workshops, solicited the opinions of the workers, and found that the reason for the production chaos was that the lines for parking incoming and outgoing vehicles were not fixed, which affected the receiving, dispatching and scheduling of the vehicles. They immediately mobilized the workers to put forward suggestions on how to fix the lines and complete the production tasks. The leadership's in-depth work style boosted the workers' production enthusiasm. They put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals on how to fix the lines in the future. Fifty-four of the 61 groups in the station put forward initiatives and guarantees. After December 8 last year, production began to get on the right track, and the production tasks were fully overfulfilled.

The workers were very satisfied with the change in the leadership's work style, and many people posted big-character posters praising the leadership's work style of going deep into the masses and deep into production.

Now, the leaders of Jiang'an Railway Station have also followed the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, which proposed to them to "cadre workerization, labor regularization, and style massization," and have formulated specific plans. It is stipulated that from February, the 19 leading cadres of the station will each participate in one day of labor in various types of work in the freight yard every week, and each will go deep into the workers' residences more than twice a week. Each person has also made specific divisions of labor according to the method of district contracting. The main purpose of going down to work is to familiarize themselves with and master the labor skills of various types of work. Who learns what, and how long will it take to meet the requirements? All have been specifically ordered. They have also established a registration book to specifically record the problems found by the leaders in participating in production and going deep into the workers' residences, and the Party committee organizes a report and study once a week.

    干部“三化”
    本报记者　张碨
    汉口江岸车站的职工们在整风中，提了六千四百零一条意见。对这些意见，车站领导人员立即解决了90％以上；但是，只注意了一条一条地处理，却没有从根本上，即同一切问题有密切关系的领导作风上来改进。因此职工对今后改进工作仍然缺乏信心。许多群众反映：“从数字上看，领导上改的倒也不少；可是，领导作风并没改好。”不少人继续对领导作风提出批评，说他们不深入下层，不了解职工情况，要求领导走出办公室，到职工家里，到生产班组看看。
    车站党委会决心接受群众的批评，组织了党委书记、站长、工会主席等党政工作人员九十四人，分别到三百一十九名职工家里去促膝谈心。
    一天傍晚，党委副书记严其祥去拜访线路值班员黄明治。那时，他还不认识黄明治，就先到一个老工人家里去打听黄明治的住处。恰巧黄明治就在旁边屋子里住，他听见严书记来找他，就把自己的门关了。严其祥把这情形看到了眼里，知道黄明治不大欢迎他。是去还是不去呢？他想了想还是装着若无其事的样子，去敲开了黄明治家的门。他主动和黄明治扯些家庭、小孩等生活上的事儿，黄明治一问一答的，不愿多谈。严其祥诚恳地向他检讨了过去领导工作不深入，不主动接近群众，因此对许多情况不了解，表示要狠狠地改进，并征求黄明治对生产、生活等各方面的意见。黄明治很感动，便把闷在心里好几年的话讲了出来。
    原来，1955年时，他把爱人接出来后，生活上非常困难，找工会借钱工会没借给，和工会的同志吵了一架。以后，他借了别人的钱，每月背利息，更加重了困难。而领导方面一直没人来过问过。1952年，他曾要求入党，也没有谁来找他谈过。因此，他很灰心：“你们不来理我，我也不理你们，你们嫌我落后，我就落后。”生产上一直没有多大劲头。另外，他还反映了有些青工劳动纪律松懈。在值班时睡大觉，领导人不加干涉。他认为这种情形应该赶快改进。对他的意见，严其祥都认真记下来，表示将分别加以改进。有个别事情向他作了解释。他们一直谈了三个多钟头，严其祥临走时，黄明治送他出来，说：“这是我六年来第一次和领导谈心里话，我很高兴，今后我一定把工作搞好。”自从他和领导人员的隔阂消除了以后，工作热情大大提高。1957年底，因为他在线路固定方面一直坚持执行制度，为下班打好基础，成为全站线路固定方面做得最好的一个，受到了奖励。
    工会主席江宗林过去最不接近工人，几乎没有到工人家里去过，因此整风中群众对他的意见最多。这次，他除了公开向群众作检讨外，又亲自到老工人白金祥、展俊突等家里拜访，向他们检讨自己作风上的缺点。白金祥、展俊突看见工会主席到自己家里来非常高兴，把存在心里的话都对他讲开了，白金祥甚至把他不同意某个青工跟他女儿谈恋爱，而误以为那个青工报复了他的事情也讲给江宗林听。展俊突的妻子专门做了两碗面，非叫江宗林吃了才许走。最近，江宗林到老扳道员郑冠钦家里去谈心时，郑冠钦兴奋地说：“要十五年赶上英国，依我看，我们得做到三条：一是要完成生产任务，二是保证安全，三要注意节约。我这个扳道员最主要的是做到保证安全，我保证一辈子不出事故。”副站长曲作敏和商务副站长宋志周等是非党员，也都积极转变作风，到住在很远的工人家里去和工人谈心，听取工人的意见。
    现在，他们深入职工宿舍已成为习惯。工会主席和有的党委书记就住在工人宿舍内，经常利用吃完饭或晚上的时间到分散住着的职工家里去。
    江岸车站的领导人还深入生产，向工人学习生产经验。他们利用星期天的时间，分别到现场当司磅员、巡守员、货票传递员、服务员、车号员等，从早上七时二十分上班点名开始，一直到晚上九点交班为止，参加整个白班的生产。
    参加生产的第一天，车站站长刘继长挂了个红袖章在货场门口担任巡守员，负责检查进出车辆的证件。他忙碌了一天，检查了数百辆车的证件，中午时，家里把饭送到货场来，直到一点多钟才顾上吃。这时，他一不留意，有两辆卡车开进货场去了，他连喊带跑地赶到车辆跟前，查问他们的证件，发现这两辆卡车是到别的货场拉煤的，却错跑到车站的货场来拉煤。他连忙把两辆卡车打发走了，避免了一次货物错运的损失（货主的货少了，车站应赔偿）。这件事情深深教育了刘继长。原来刘继长是不重视巡守员工作的，他说：巡守员不过是在货场门口照护照护出进的车辆，有什么要紧？因此，当巡守员因为货场离货运室太远，发生问题不好立即联系，而要求领导方面给他们安装上一部电话时，被他一口回绝了。现在，他亲身体会了巡守员责任的重大，便马上叫人给货场安装了电话，并且注意好好安排巡守员的工作。
    工会主席江宗林原来不懂业务，有时和工人谈话，往往说了外行话，工人就笑他。整风以来，他下去连续担任了几次司磅员和其他职务以后，对装车、卸车等作业过程和一些业务名称都懂得了。他说：“现在我布置工作时，对职工提要求也有了本钱了。”
    在和工人一起劳动的过程中，他们随时注意发现问题解决问题。他们发现各个班组在交接班和装卸货物等方面，有许多不按制度办事的情形，各个部门之间的协作也不够好，他们都及时采取了相应的措施解决了。江宗林发现仓库内将六六六粉和红枣、红糖放在一起，党委副书记严其祥发现危险货物仓库内，将炸药和棉花堆放在一起，都批评了货运室领导，立即加以纠正。
    他们改变了过去那种一下车间，就把人叫来汇报，听听汇报就走的作法，随时注意抓住生产关键问题，下到班组征求职工们的意见，改进工作。去年11月间，长江大桥通车以后，每天往来江岸车站的货车数量突然由七十多列增加到一百多列。任务突然增加，一时应接不了，车辆调度不开，货场堵塞起来，生产陷入混乱状态，任务完成不了。车站领导人员便深入各个车间，征求职工意见，发现了生产混乱的原因是来往车辆停摆的线路没有固定，所以影响了车辆的接送和调度。他们立即发动职工对如何固定线路完成生产任务提出建议。领导人员的深入作风，鼓舞了职工们的生产热情，他们对今后如何固定线路提出了一百多条合理化建议，全站六十一个小组有五十四个小组提出倡议和保证条件。去年12月8日以后，生产便开始走上正轨，生产任务也全面超额完成了。
    职工们对领导作风的转变很满意，许多人贴大字报表扬领导深入群众、深入生产的作风。
    现在，江岸车站领导人员又遵照中共湖北省委和武汉市委向他们提出的“干部工人化，劳动经常化，作风群众化”的指示，拟订了具体规划，规定车站的十九名领导干部从2月份开始，每人每星期参加一天货场各工种的劳动，每人每星期深入工人住宅两次以上。各人还按照分区包干的办法，作了具体分工。下去劳动的主要目的是熟悉和掌握各工种劳动技能。谁学什么，多长时间达到什么要求？都具体订了出来。他们还建立了登记本，专门登记领导人员参加生产和深入职工住宅发现的问题，每周由党委会组织汇报和研究一次。
