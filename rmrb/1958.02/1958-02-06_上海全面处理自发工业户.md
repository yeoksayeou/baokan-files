Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th: Shanghai's comprehensive investigation and handling of spontaneous industrial households concluded on the 3rd. Among them, nearly eight thousand households were ordered to operate honestly; more than five thousand households have been shut down or voluntarily ceased operations. Among these five thousand households, some were opened by employees and their families, some produced products not needed by the market, and some were involved in serious illegal activities.

Shanghai's work to curb spontaneous forces began in the fourth quarter of last year. Based on the principle of serious handling and differentiated treatment, it adopted methods of publicizing policies, organizing debates, self-reporting, and handling in batches. Some, due to theft of state property or serious illegal circumstances, have been transferred to the judicial authorities for punishment. Self-employed industrial households permitted to continue operating are required to use unified invoices and have their profits restricted through taxation. These self-employed industrial households that continue to operate mainly produce small daily commodities that state-owned or joint state-private enterprises do not produce or produce insufficiently.

　　上海全面处理自发工业户
    据新华社上海4日电  上海自发工业户的全面清查处理工作3日已告一段落。其中近八千户责令老实经营；有五千多户已被取缔或自动停业。这五千户中有的是在职人员及其家属开设的，有的是产品不为市场所需要的，也有的是严重违法户。
    上海这项制止自发势力的工作是从去年第四季度开始的，根据严肃处理、区别对待的方针，采取了宣传政策、组织辩论、自查申报、分批处理的方法。一部分因有盗窃国家资财行为或违法情节恶劣，已经移送司法部门惩处。对准予继续经营的自发工业户，规定必须使用统一发票，并通过税收限制他们的利润。这些继续经营的自发工业户，主要生产国营或公私合营企业不生产或生产不足的日用小商品。
