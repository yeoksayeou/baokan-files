Odds and Ends

    Fertilizer Made from Sulfur Residue
    The Fengjie Sulfur Plant in Sichuan Province has successfully trial-produced ammonium sulfate using sulfur residue. The plant plans to produce 1,000 tons of ammonium sulfate this year, enough to fertilize more than 300,000 mu of cotton fields in the Wanxian Special District at a rate of over six jin per mu.
    Ammonium sulfate is a nitrogen fertilizer with high fertility and fast effectiveness. The ammonium sulfate produced by this plant meets the standards of the Soviet Union's second-grade products, while the manufacturing cost is only three fen per jin. Every 100 jin of sulfur residue can extract 35 jin of ammonium sulfate. (Fu Pu et al.)
    Trial Production of New Products for the Vacuum Tube Industry
    The Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory will trial-produce 28 new products with higher technical requirements this year. These include various ultra-high frequency electronic tubes for modern defense and modern industry, as well as various X-ray tubes for medical treatment, metal flaw detection, and other purposes. In January, trial production of thirteen new products has already begun simultaneously.
    Vinegar Made from Shrub Fruit
    Shanxi vinegar, famous throughout the country, has always been brewed from grain. Yuci County, Shanxi Province, has recently trial-produced a kind of vinegar using the fruit of a shrub called vinegar willow. Its aroma is fragrant and sour, just like vinegar brewed from grain. (Zhou Rusong)
    Power Transmission to Mountains and Countryside
    "Send electricity to the mountains and countryside to support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture" is the slogan put forward by the Qinghai Province power industry department this year. This slogan is being rapidly realized.
    A 31-kilometer-long high-voltage power transmission line from Xining to Qiaotou will connect the Xining People's Power Plant and the Qiaotou Power Plant, forming a power grid. More than 20,000 mu of land in Xining Beishan Temple, Houzihe Township, Qiaotou New Urban and Rural Areas, and other places will be irrigated with electricity this year.
    The Qinghai Province power industry department also plans to adopt a method of government assistance and public management to establish a large number of small hydropower stations in rural areas for rural oil pressing, flour milling, grain threshing, grass cutting, small repairs, sheep shearing, and milking.

    硫磺渣制肥料
    四川省奉节硫磺厂利用硫磺脚渣试制硫酸铵成功。这个厂计划今年生产一千吨硫酸铵，可供万县专区三十万亩棉田每亩施肥六斤多。
    硫酸铵是一种肥力大、肥效快的氮素肥料。这个厂制成的硫酸铵质量相当于苏联二级产品的标准，而每斤制造成本只要三分钱。每百斤硫磺渣可以提取三十五斤硫酸铵。　（傅浦等）
    试制电真空工业新产品
    南京电子管厂今年将试制技术要求更高的新产品二十八种。其中包括现代国防和现代工业用的各种超高频电子管，用于医疗、金属探伤等用途的各种X光管。1月份，已经有十三种新产品同时动手开始试制。
    灌木果实制醋
    全国闻名的山西醋，一向用粮食酿造。山西省榆社县最近用一种名叫醋柳的灌木果实试制了一种醋柳醋。它的气味香酸，和粮食酿的醋一样。（周如松）
    送电上山下乡
    “把电送到山上和乡下去，支援农业大跃进”，这是青海省电力工业部门今年提出的行动口号。这个口号已在迅速地实现着。
    一条从西宁到桥头三十一公里长的高压送电线，将把西宁人民电厂和桥头电厂连接起来，组成一个电力网。西宁北山寺、后子河乡、桥头新城乡等地，今年将有两万多亩土地用电力灌溉。
    青海省的电力工业部门还计划采取民办公助办法，在农村中大量建立小型水电站，供农村榨油、磨面、脱谷、铡草、小型修理或剪羊毛、挤牛奶等用。
