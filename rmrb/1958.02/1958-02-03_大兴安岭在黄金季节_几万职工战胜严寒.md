Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, February 2nd: The cold weather has not caused the tens of thousands of workers fighting in the Great Xing'an Mountains forest area to retreat a single step. They completed their monthly production plan ahead of schedule on January 27th.

Now, the Great Xing'an Mountains forest area is covered in white snow, and the temperature has dropped to minus forty degrees Celsius. However, the workers felling timber here are not afraid of this severe winter, but call it the "golden season for producing timber." Because in this season, they can produce more timber for the country than in the rainy, muddy, and mosquito-ridden summer.

Here, the revolutionary vigor shown by the workers in completing this year's task of producing 2.3 million cubic meters of timber is truly moving. On the logging, skidding, old stockpile, and timber transportation sites in the forest area, workers can be seen everywhere with frost flowers and even ice hanging from their eyebrows and the edges of their fur hats. The Siberian wind and snow sweep through the valleys, hitting the workers' bodies and faces; sometimes the workers' noses and faces are frozen stiff, but they grab a handful of snow, rub it, and then fight the severe cold with renewed vigor.

　　大兴安岭在黄金季节
    几万职工战胜严寒
    本报特约新华社牙克石2日电　寒冷的气候并没有使战斗在大兴安岭林区的几万名职工退缩一步，他们在1月27日就提前完成了月度生产计划。
    现在大兴安岭林区到处白雪皑皑，气温已经下降到零下四十度。但是，在这里采伐木材的职工不是畏惧这严冷的冬天，而是把它称之为“生产木材的黄金季节”。因为在这样的季节，比雨多、路泞、蚊虻叮咬人的夏天，能为国家生产出更多的木材。
    在这里，职工们为完成今年生产木材二百三十万立方公尺的任务所表现的那股革命干劲，实在使人感动，在林区的采伐、集材、旧垛和运材工地上，到处可以看到工人们的眉睫毛和皮帽的毛梢上，都凝结着霜花，甚至冰溜。西伯利亚的风雪扫过山谷，打在工人们的身上和脸上；有时工人们的鼻子和脸都冻得发僵了，可是他们抓起把雪，搓一搓，就又精神焕发地向严寒展开搏斗。
