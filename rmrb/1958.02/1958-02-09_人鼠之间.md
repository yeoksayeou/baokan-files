    Of Mice and Men
    Since the Soviet Union tested the reactions of living dogs at high altitudes in artificial satellites, some people in the United States seem to have developed a special sense of compassion for animals. Not long ago, Western newspapers reported that the United States was preparing to use only artificially cultured yeast cells instead of mammals in satellites; recently, American newspapers also published a piece of news, not entirely unintentionally, that students at Littleton High School in Colorado were severely reprimanded and prohibited by the school principal for experimenting with a mouse in a small rocket. The "American Humane Society" also sent a telegram demanding that school authorities prohibit students from using any living organisms for experimentation.
    From these things, it seems that the United States is such a humane world! But what is strange is that while the United States is so compassionate towards mice, it stubbornly refuses to stop nuclear weapons testing, which seriously endangers human life, and these so-called "humane societies" in the United States have not raised any protests. Could it be that in the eyes of some American gentlemen, humans are really inferior to mice?

    人鼠之间
    自从苏联在人造卫星里以活狗试验生物在高空的反应之后，美国的某些人好像对于动物特别大发起慈悲来。不久以前西方报刊刚报道过美国准备在人造卫星中不拿哺乳动物来做试验，而只放一点人工培养的酵母细胞；最近美国报纸又并非无意地登载了一段消息，据说科罗拉多州里特顿市立中学的学生因为把一只老鼠放在小型火箭里做试验，受到了该校校长的严厉斥责和禁止。“美国人道社团”并且发出了一封电报，要求学校当局禁止学生采用任何生物做试验。
    从这些事情看来，美国是一个多么讲人道的世界呵！但是人们奇怪的是，美国对于老鼠都如此慈悲为怀，但是对于严重危害人类生命的核武器试验，却死也不肯停止进行，而也并未见美国的这些所谓“人道社团”提出过什么抗议。难道在一些美国老爷的眼里，真是人不如鼠？
