    To Realize a Thousand-Jin Farm
    To realize a thousand-jin farm at the Nanjing Agricultural College, faculty, students, and staff members took advantage of the winter vacation to carry out voluntary labor and construct water conservancy projects on the college farm. Students who originally planned to go home, visit relatives, or see friends gave up these plans and devoted themselves entirely to labor.
    Every morning at five o'clock, the labor force set off for the construction site, more than ten li away from the school, and returned to school at six o'clock in the evening. Braving the cold, the frost, and the drizzling rain, they persisted in the battle, carrying out dredging projects in muddy ponds that were thigh-deep and building small reservoirs and storage ponds in the valleys. This will turn hundreds of acres of dry land on the farm into paddy fields, making 1958 a thousand-jin farm.

    为了实现千斤农场
    南京农学院的师生员工们为了在本院实现千斤农场，利用寒假展开义务劳动，兴修该院农场的水利工程。原来准备假期回家、探亲、访友的学生放弃了这个打算，全部投入劳动中去。
    每日清晨五点钟，劳动大军就向离学校十多里外的工地出发了，晚上六点钟才返校。他们冒着天寒、地冻、蒙泷细雨，坚持战斗，在烂泥平大腿深的泥塘里进行疏浚工程，在山谷建筑小型水库和蓄水池。这样可使农场数百亩旱地变为水田，1958年成为千斤农场。
