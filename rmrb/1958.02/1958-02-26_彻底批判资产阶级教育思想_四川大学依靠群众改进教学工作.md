Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 25th: Sichuan University, in the course of rectification, has mobilized teachers and students to expose and criticize bourgeois educational thought, and is relying on the strength of the masses to improve teaching.

    The special topic forum at Sichuan University on improving teaching began in mid-January. Over the past month, teachers and students have used big-character posters and discussion meetings to expose many teachers' bourgeois thoughts that are detached from politics and reality in teaching. They claim to "teach books but not people," and intentionally or unintentionally spread erroneous arguments among students such as "science has no class," "obscure fields produce experts," and so-called "coldness theory" of "indifference to politics and love of profession." Some teachers even promote that to learn well, one should be like a monk, "transcending the world." The situation of theory being detached from practice is relatively serious in the science departments. Some teachers in the Biology Department even declared that biology is specifically for studying theory, and practice is for medical and agricultural colleges. In their teaching, they rarely connect the significance of biological sciences to the national economy. The teaching work in departments such as Chinese has tendencies toward archaism and a purely artistic viewpoint.
    Many teachers despise modern literature and uncritically promote classical literature, some even regarding "Wen Xin Diao Long" as a classic of literary theory. In their lectures, they often only talk about the artistry of the works, detaching them from ideology, and some even declare that literature is only for enjoyment. When explaining Ji Kang and Ruan Ji, some teachers do not focus on their resistance and rebellion against the feudal rulers, but simply promote their passive and decadent thoughts. History department teachers often replace the elaboration of historical development laws with explanations of historical terms. Some people prefer trivial textual research, and when lecturing on the Song Dynasty, they talk in detail about the pancake shops in Kaifeng at the time, but do not mention Wen Tianxiang at all. Many teachers lack a Marxist-Leninist historical materialism viewpoint in their teaching, over-promoting the activities of emperors, generals, and heroic figures, and neglecting the role of the people in history.
    After mass criticism and exposure, teachers have realized the serious harm of bourgeois educational thought. Many teachers have consciously posted big-character posters or checked their mistakes at discussion meetings, expressing their determination to improve. After multiple meetings for examination and criticism, the teachers in the Chinese Department unanimously agreed that establishing the leadership of Marxist-Leninist literary thought is the central issue in improving teaching, and decided to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist literary theory. In order to overcome the shortcomings of theory being detached from practice in teaching, the Economics Department is preparing to invite heads of Sichuan Province's financial and economic departments to regularly report on the major issues of current financial and economic work. Biology Department teachers have decided to strengthen practical work by strengthening production practice and graduation thesis guidance, as well as improving scientific research. Many teachers in the Chinese, Economics, and other departments are developing individual plans to improve teaching and strengthen learning based on their own shortcomings.

    彻底批判资产阶级教育思想
    四川大学依靠群众改进教学工作
    新华社成都25日电　四川大学在整改中发动教师和学生揭发批判资产阶级教育思想，依靠群众力量改进教学工作。
    四川大学改进教学工作的专题鸣放，是从1月中旬开始的。一个月来，师生们在大字报、座谈会上，揭发出许多教师在教学中存在的脱离政治、脱离实际的资产阶级思想。他们声称“教书不教人”，有意无意地在学生中散布“科学无阶级论”“冷门成专家论”和所谓“冷淡政治、酷爱业务”的“冷酷论”等错误论调。有的教师甚至宣传要学好功课应该像和尚一样“超凡出世”。理科各系教学中理论脱离实际的情况比较严重。生物系一些教师甚至扬言生物学是专门研究理论的，实践是医学院和农学院的事。他们在教学中很少联系生物科学在国民经济中的意义。中文等系的教学工作存在颂古非今的复古主义和单纯艺术观点等倾向。
    不少教师轻视现代文学，无批判地推崇古典文学，有的甚至把“文心雕龙”奉为文艺理论的经典。他们在讲课中往往脱离思想性而只谈作品的艺术性，有的甚至宣称文学只是享乐。有的教师在讲解嵇康、阮籍时，不着重讲解他们对封建统治者的反抗和叛逆精神，而单纯宣扬他们的消极颓废思想。历史系教师往往以历史名词的解说代替对历史发展规律的阐述，有的人偏爱烦琐的考证，在讲宋史时，把当时开封的烧饼店讲得很详细，对文天祥却只字不提。不少教师在教学中缺乏马列主义的历史唯物主义观点，过多宣传帝王将相及英雄人物的活动，忽视人民群众在历史中的作用。
    经过群众性的批评、揭发，教师们认识到资产阶级教育思想的严重危害性，许多教师自觉地贴出大字报或在座谈会上检查自己的错误，表示改进的决心。中文系教师们经过多次会议检查批判后，一致认为树立马列主义文艺思想的领导，是改进教学的中心问题，决定加强马克思列宁主义文艺理论的学习。经济系为了克服教学中理论脱离实际的缺点，准备邀请四川省财经部门负责人定期作当前财经工作主要问题的报告。生物系教师决定从加强生产实习和毕业论文指导以及改进科学研究工作等方面着手，加强联系实际工作。中文、经济等系许多教师正在根据自己的缺点，制订改进教学和加强学习的个人计划。
