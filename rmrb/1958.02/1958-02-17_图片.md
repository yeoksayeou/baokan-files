    Shanghai No. 3 Technical School's entire faculty and student body have set a goal to be financially self-sufficient for the entire year, contribute 600,000 yuan to the state, and return all state investment used to establish the school.

    This school was founded in 1956 and has more than 540 students. The entire school has 77 machine tools, of which 75 were made by the students themselves or converted from discarded machine tools; only two precision machine tools were purchased. In addition to manufacturing practice machine tools, the faculty and students also produced 24 machine tools for outside factories. The students are using self-made lathes to produce parts for the 16.5 model Soviet-style lathe. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yue Guofang photo
