    Long-Term Stockpiling of Equipment
    During the First Five-Year Plan, the stockpiling of funds in capital construction was quite serious. For example, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant exceeded the state's prescribed reserve figures every year, exceeding 45% in 1954, 12% in 1955, and 120% in 1956. Equipment stockpiled prematurely amounted to 381 units, 2,544 tons, valued at 15,827,000 yuan. Among them, 276 units were stockpiled for more than one year, 95 units for more than two years, and 10 units for more than three years. Furthermore, the Sichuan Fertilizer Plant started stockpiling in 1951 and had stockpiled over 10 million yuan by the third quarter of this year, with installation not scheduled to begin until 1958. In addition, stockpiling was also quite serious. For example, the Jinxi Chemical Plant had 26 stagnant chlorine gas exhaust fans, valued at 280,000 yuan, which were stockpiled six years ago and have not been dealt with since. Such a large-scale, long-term stockpiling of national construction funds does not conform to the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." If we can take some measures to shorten the reserve period and promptly dispose of stockpiles, we will free up more funds for economic construction, which will undoubtedly accelerate the speed of our country's industrialization. Therefore, it is hoped that relevant departments, especially equipment departments, should take active measures to prevent excessively long reserve times and dispose of existing stockpiled equipment in the short term, so as to better implement the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Does Carbon Black Need to Fly by Plane?
    A portion of the carbon black required by the Chemical Industry Department's rubber factory is supplied by Longchang, Sichuan. In the past, when the train was not accessible, it had been transported by civil aviation to Shanghai and Beijing since 1954, and then transferred to the factory by train. However, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opened in June 1956, yet air transport was still used, which is obviously unreasonable. The freight per ton from Sichuan to Beijing and Shanghai alone is 400 yuan (it was 650 yuan before the train was accessible in 1956), plus an additional 20.71 yuan for train transfer freight. Miscellaneous fees, unloading, insurance, etc. are not included. Taking the three factories as an example, if the train directly arrived at the site, it would cost only 63.46 yuan. In 1957, the actual transport volume was 223 tons. If transported by rail, it would only cost 14,188.2 yuan, while air transport would cost 89,200 yuan.
    This year, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway officially opened. If air transport is still used, taking the three factories' annual volume of 232 tons as an example, the air freight would be 92,180 yuan. If changed to rail transport, it would only cost 14,708.8 yuan. Increasing the cost of enterprises is not in line with enterprise economic accounting, and civil aviation maintenance personnel have reported that carbon black makes passenger planes very dirty, and passengers also have opinions. We believe that such transportation should not continue.

    设备长期积压
    在第一个五年计划时期，基本建设中资金积压情况相当严重，如吉林肥料厂每年都大大超过了国家规定的储备数字，1954年超过45％，1955年超过12％，1956年超过120％，过早储备的设备即达三百八十一台，二千五百四十四吨，计一千五百八十二万七千元。其中：储备一年以上的有二百七十六台，两年以上的九十五台，三年以上的十台；又如四川肥料厂从1951年起就开始储备，至本年第三季度止共储备了一千多万元，要到1958年才能开始安装。另外积压情况也相当严重，如锦西化工厂由六年前储备的设备转化为呆滞的氯气排气机二十六台，价值共二十八万元，六年来无人过问不作处理。像这样大量长期积压国家建设资金的现象是不符合“又多、又快、又好、又省”的建设方针的，如果我们能采取一些措施，缩短储备期间，及时处理积压，便会腾出更多的资金从事经济建设，无疑将会更快地加速我国的工业化速度。因此，希望有关部门，尤其是设备部门应采取积极措施防止储备时间过长，并对现有积压设备在短期内处理完毕，以便在第二个五年计划期间更好地贯彻“又多、又快、又好、又省”的建设方针。

    炭黑要坐飞机吗？
    化工部橡胶厂生产所需炭黑一部由四川隆昌供应。过去火车不通，自1954年起一直由民航负责分别运往上海、北京，再以火车转运工厂，但1956年6月宝成铁路通车了，仍用飞机运输，显然不太合理。仅自四川至北京、上海每吨运费四百元（1956年火车未通前为六百五十元）另须再加火车中转运费二十点七一元，杂费、卸车、保险费等尚不在内，仅以三厂为例，如以火车直抵需用地仅六十三点四六元，1957年实际运二百二十三吨，如果以铁路运输仅用一万四千一百八十八点二元，空运则为八万九千二百元。
    今年宝成铁路正式通车了，如再空运时，仍以三厂全年二百三十二吨计算，空运费则为九万二千一百八十元，如改为铁路运输仅一万四千七百零八点八元。提高企业的成本，对企业经济核算是不相符的，而且民航机务人员反映说炭黑把客机弄得很脏，并且乘客还有意见，我们认为这样的运输是不应该再继续下去了。
