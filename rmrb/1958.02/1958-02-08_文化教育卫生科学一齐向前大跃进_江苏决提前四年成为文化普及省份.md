Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting of the secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees in the southern and northern Jiangsu districts, deciding to basically achieve the targets related to culture, education, and health in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within four years, and become a province of universal education. The meeting proposed to expand the ranks of civil school teachers from the current 500,000 to 1 million within two years, organize 10 million illiterate and semi-literate people to participate in literacy learning, and use this group as the backbone to further develop mass learning, so as to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people throughout the province within four years.

　　The meeting proposed to universalize primary school education throughout the province within four years. Suzhou Prefecture, which is more culturally developed and has a better economic foundation, should universalize primary school education within two years. Changshu City, which has already universalized primary school education, also proposed to strive to universalize junior high school education within four years.

　　Jiangsu Province has already proposed to become a "four-without province" within four years, eliminate flies and sparrows within two years, eliminate rats within three years, and eliminate mosquitoes within four years. Combined with the "eliminate four pests" campaign, it will vigorously eliminate endemic diseases, first take comprehensive measures in water conservancy projects and other work, and eliminate the schistosomiasis host snails in 1958. Diseases such as filariasis, kala-azar, venereal diseases, malaria, typhus, infantile tetanus, and relapsing fever will be strived to be basically eliminated within four years. The provincial health department is also actively taking measures to expand the ranks of medical personnel, planning to train 3,800 senior medical personnel and 8,000 intermediate personnel within five years, and organize more than 20,000 Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in refresher courses and systematic review at least once.

　　Mass cultural undertakings will be greatly developed. This year, every agricultural cooperative will have a club, every township will have broadcasting. Within three or four years, a rural cultural network with rural clubs, wired broadcasting stations, book and periodical distribution stations, and film projection stations in every cooperative can be formed throughout the province. The city's theater troupes and film projection teams will also go to the countryside to perform and show films with their main force in the future.

　　The popularization of science and technology throughout the province will also be vigorously carried out. The province's science organs and sixteen universities will organize scientific workers, teachers, and students to go to the countryside to promote science and technology in labor. This year, the Jiangsu Provincial Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology will organize more than 250,000 lectures in coordination with industrial and agricultural production and the patriotic health campaign to send science and technology to workshops and agricultural cooperatives. Within five years, science popularization work groups will be established in every township, farm, and qualified factories, mines, and enterprises, so that the number of science popularization members will increase from the current 30,000 to 50,000; in each township, they will assist agricultural cooperatives and Communist Youth League organizations in holding various training courses and technical night schools to help train various technicians for agricultural cooperatives and help transferred cadres learn agricultural technology. Within five years, 1.5 million to 2 million lectures will be completed throughout the province.

　　文化教育卫生科学一齐向前大跃进
    江苏决提前四年成为文化普及省份
    新华社南京6日电　中共江苏省委最近在苏南、苏北分区召开地委、市委书记会议，决定在四年内全省基本实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中有关文化、教育、卫生等项工作的指标，成为一个文化普及的省份。这次会议提出，计划在两年内把民校教师队伍从现在的五十万人扩大到一百万人，组织一千万文盲半文盲参加扫盲学习，并以这批人为骨干，进一步开展群众学习，做到四年内在全省范围内基本上扫除青壮年中的文盲。
    这次会议提出，要在四年内普及全省小学教育，文化较发达的和经济基础较好的苏州专区要在两年内普及小学教育。已经普及小学教育的常熟市，还提出力争在四年内普及初中教育。
    江苏省已经提出四年内成为“四无省”，两年内消灭苍蝇和麻雀，三年内消灭老鼠，四年内消灭蚊子。结合除四害运动，将大力消灭地方性疾病，首先在兴修水利等工作中采取综合性措施，在1958年消灭血吸虫病的寄主钉螺。丝虫病、黑热病、性病、疟疾、斑疹伤寒、小儿破伤风、回归热等疾病，力争在四年内基本消灭。省卫生部门还积极采取措施扩大医务人员的队伍，计划在五年内培养高级医务人员三千八百名，中级人员八千名，组织两万多中医分别进行一次以上的进修和系统温课。
    群众性的文化事业将有很大发展。今年每个农业社都将做到有俱乐部，每乡有广播，在三、四年内全省农村就可以组成一个社社有农村俱乐部、有线广播站、书刊发行站、电影放映站的农村文化网。城市的剧团和电影放映队，今后也将以主要力量到农村去演出和放映。
