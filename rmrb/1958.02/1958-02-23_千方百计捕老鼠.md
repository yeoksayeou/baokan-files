Xiao Jigui, of the Ji'an City Grain Bureau, has caught 8,400 rats over four years with unremitting effort. Soon after he started working at the granary, he noticed a serious problem of rats stealing grain. In September 1954, the weather was very hot, and the bait used on the rat traps in the warehouse was mostly fried dough sticks, fresh fish, etc., which the rats would not eat. One time, he used sweet potatoes as bait, and caught seven rats that night. Rat catching throughout the warehouse increased greatly as a result. However, after a while, the rats were not so easily caught again. He guessed that it was because the rats didn't like eating the same thing all the time, so he frequently changed the bait, which worked well. Later, he also researched that rats like to run to warm places in winter and cool places in summer, so he often changed the location of the rat traps, which also worked very well.

    千方百计捕老鼠
    吉安市粮食局萧纪贵四年如一日，已捕到老鼠八千四百只。他到粮库工作不久，就发现老鼠偷吃粮食的现象严重。1954年9月间，天气很热，仓库捕鼠板的食饵用的都是油条、鲜鱼等，老鼠不吃。有一次，他用甘薯当食饵，当天晚上就打到七只老鼠。全库捕鼠随着大大增加。可是过了一段时间，老鼠又不大上钩了。他猜着是因为老鼠不喜欢常吃一种东西，于是经常换食饵，效果很好。后来，他又研究出老鼠的习性是冬天喜欢往暖和的地方跑，夏天喜欢往阴凉的地方钻，他就经常调换装置捕鼠板的地点，效果也很好。
