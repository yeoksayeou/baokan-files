Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 13th. Indian newspapers today published a joint statement by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. In the joint statement, they unanimously agreed that holding a high-level meeting to consider stopping the testing of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, as a way to gradually achieve disarmament and ease world tensions, is entirely appropriate. The two leaders hope that such a meeting will be held soon.

In the joint statement, President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Nehru reaffirmed their confidence in the "Panchsheel" Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. They expressed their belief that applying these principles in international relations will help ease international tensions and help provide a foundation for peace and understanding between countries.

The two leaders believe that military blocs will only exacerbate international tensions. They also stated that they are determined to continue to intensify their efforts within their respective spheres to maintain world peace and promote understanding between countries.

The joint statement also said that colonialism and the act of foreign forcible occupation or control of other countries' territories have no place in today's world. The two leaders expressed deep sympathy for the people of all countries struggling for their own independence and sovereignty. They expressed satisfaction with the independence already gained by some countries in Asia and Africa. The main problem for newly independent countries is to give economic and social substance to their independence and to raise the living standards of their people. They agreed that foreign arms assistance and military blocs not only undermine the newly acquired independence of these countries, but also endanger the economic and social progress they urgently need.

The two leaders reaffirmed the hope expressed by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference in 1956: "The International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam will continue its efforts to maintain and consolidate peace in Vietnam on the basis of implementing the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam, with a view to restoring the unification of Vietnam through free national elections held in Vietnam under the supervision of an international commission." The two leaders stressed the need to promote mutual understanding between the two regions of Vietnam in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Geneva Agreements.

President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Nehru welcomed the results achieved in the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Cambodia, as well as the recent progress made by Laos in the implementation of the Geneva Agreements.

    胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理联合声明
    希望早日举行高级会议缓和局势
    越南应在国际委员会监督下举行选举实现统一
    新华社新德里13日电　印度报纸今天发表了越南民主共和国主席胡志明和印度总理尼赫鲁的联合声明。他们在联合声明中一致认为，举行高级会议来考虑停止核武器和热核武器的试验，作为逐步实现裁军和缓和世界紧张局势的途径，是完全适当的。两位领导人希望这种会议将早日举行。
    胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理在联合声明中重申他们对“潘查希拉”五项和平共处原则的信心。他们表示相信，在国际关系中应用这些原则，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和有助于为和平和为各国之间的谅解提供基础。
    两国领导人认为，军事集团只会加剧国际紧张局势。他们并且表示，他们决心在各自的范围内继续加紧努力，以维持世界和平和促进各国之间的了解。
    联合声明还说，殖民主义和外国强制占领或者控制其他国家领土的行为在今天的世界上是没有地位的。两国领导人对于为自身的独立和主权而斗争的各国人民表示深切的同情。他们对于亚洲和非洲一些国家已经获得的独立表示欣慰。新近独立的国家的主要问题是对它们的独立赋予经济和社会的内容，以及提高本国人民的生活水平。他们一致认为，外国的武器援助和军事集团不仅损害这些国家新近取得的独立，而且还危及到它们在经济和社会方面迫切需要的进步。
    两国领导人重申日内瓦会议的两位主席在1956年所表示的希望：“越南国际监督和监察委员会今后仍将进行努力，以在履行关于越南的日内瓦协议的基础上，维护和巩固越南的和平，以期通过在一个国际委员会的监督下举行的越南全国性的自由选举，来恢复越南的统一”。两国领导人着重指出，有必要按照日内瓦协议的原则和规定，来促进越南两个地区之间的相互了解。
    胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理欢迎在柬埔寨执行日内瓦协议所获得的成果，以及最近老挝在执行日内瓦协议方面所取得的进展。
