　　Springtime in Spring
　　Ai Wu
　　In terms of the seasons, spring has arrived. But the spring for us Chinese people arrived the day China was liberated. Every day our hearts feel the warmth of spring, we constantly see flowers blooming and smell the overflowing fragrance. On a desolate piece of land, suddenly massive factory buildings and tall chimneys appear, thick black smoke rushing straight into the blue sky. At the mouth of a mountain gorge where a river surges, suddenly a vast expanse of bright, calm water appears, and beautiful, magnificent high-voltage lines stretch straight into the surrounding fields in all directions. Doesn't this make people happy, to feel that the land of the motherland is blooming? Tens of thousands of people, holding hoes and shovels, are making stubborn mountains bow their heads, or piercing through their bellies, allowing smoking trains to sing noisy songs, traveling to the distant mountains. And rivers that once overflowed and caused disasters are being tamed, obediently led to thirsty fields, causing lush seedlings to turn into a green ocean. Doesn't this still make people happy, to feel that the land of the motherland is in full bloom with fragrant flowers? Spring is forever in our hearts, becoming a source of continuous striving for physical and mental labor. Because of this, the power of winter in the natural world is diminished. I personally saw in Wan Quan County, where there was ice and snow, that people, whether they were grandmothers in their sixties or children of fourteen, fearlessly participated in the heroic work of digging canals, wanting to turn dry fields into irrigated fields, greatly increasing the harvest of grain. Before liberation, who would have been willing to do such a thing in the winter, braving the wind and snow? Absolutely no one. Because at that time they had no spring in their hearts, but only endless winter, their lives were filled with ice and snow, and even if wildflowers bloomed outside and their fragrance drifted into the house, their hearts were still cold, steeped in bitter water that was about to overflow their eyes.
　　Because there was already spring in our hearts, the arrival of spring in the natural world is, of course, doubly pleasing. This spring in the natural world is very different from the springs of the past. This time, the first Five-Year Plan has just been overfulfilled, and everyone knows that in 1957, on average, a new enterprise or new factory above a certain quota was completed every two days, and the face of the motherland is changing greatly. The roots of the superiority of the socialist system are deeply rooted in everyone's heart. With such a mood to greet the spring of 1958, who wouldn't be overjoyed and filled with great enthusiasm?
　　As the old saying goes: "The plan for the year lies in spring." Our wise Party Central Committee has already placed the national economic plan and financial budget for 1958 in detail before us before the arrival of spring in the natural world, and told us that in 1958, on average, a new enterprise or new factory will be put into production within forty-six hours. This makes people see more factories, mines, railways, bridges, reservoirs, canals… which will appear on the mountains and fields of the motherland, and flowering and green-leaved seedlings, fruits, and trees will cover the boundless land. The people of the whole country, having seen this national economic plan and financial budget, will joyfully, with a hundredfold confidence, strive to realize it and overfulfill it in the natural spring outside.
　　Spring of 1958, we, the people of the whole country, warmly welcome your arrival, to make the spring in our hearts more beautiful and more joyful!

　　春天里的春天
　　艾芜
    在季节上，是春天来了。但我们中国人的春天，却是从中国解放那天起，就已来到了。我们心上没有一天不感到春天一样的温暖，时时都看见花在开放，闻着芬芳四溢的花香。一片荒凉的土地上，忽然出现了庞大的厂房和高高的烟囱，浓黑的烟子直向蓝天冲去。一道河水汹涌的山峡口上，突然变成一望明静的波光，美丽雄壮的高压线，直向四方八面的原野伸去。这不叫人欢喜，感到祖国的土地上；是在开花么？成千成万的人，拿着锄头锹子，叫顽强的山低下头来，或者穿通它的肚子，让喷烟的火车，喧哗地唱着歌，走到遥远的群山里去。又把泛滥为灾的河流，驯服下来，乖乖地引到干渴的田野去，叫茂盛的禾苗，变成绿色的海洋。这还不叫人欢喜，感到祖国的土地，是在香花怒放吗？春天永远留在我们的心上，成为体力劳动和脑力劳动不断奋发的源泉。就因为这样，自然外界的冬天，就减少了它的威力。我亲眼看见，在冰天雪地的万全县的人们，不论六十多岁的老太婆，十四岁的小孩，都一无畏惧地参加挖渠的英勇工作，要把干田变成水浇田，使粮食大大地增加丰收。这在解放以前，谁肯在冬天冒着风雪做这样的事情？绝对没有的。因为那时候他们心里没有春天，而只是无穷无尽的冬天，生活中堆满了冰雪，就在屋外有野花开了，香气飘进屋来，他们的心上还是冷的，满浸着快要冒出眼眶的苦水。
    就因为心上早有了春天，自然外界的春天到来了，当然会是加倍地叫人欢喜。这个自然外界的春天，是和已往的春天又有很大的不同。这回是第一个五年计划刚刚超额完成了，大家知道1957年是平均两天就有限额以上的新企业新工厂完成，祖国的面貌，正在大大地改变。社会主义制度优越的根子，深深地扎在每个人的心里。有着这样的心情，来迎接1958年的春天，谁不欢喜若狂，鼓起很大的干劲呢？
    古语说的好：“一年之计在于春”。我们英明的党中央，已把1958年的国民经济计划，和财政预算，在自然外界的春天到来以前，就详尽地放在我们的面前，并告诉我们1958年，平均四十六小时以内，就会有一个新的企业，或是新的工厂，投入生产。使人看见了更多的工厂矿区，铁道，桥梁，水库，渠道……将要出现在祖国的山川田野上面，开着花发着绿叶的禾苗，果木，会铺盖了一望无边的大地。全国人民看了这个国民经济计划和财政预算，将会在外界自然的春天里，欢乐地带着百倍的信心，努力去实现它，超额去完成它。
    1958年的春天，我们全国人民热烈欢迎你的到来，要使我们心里的春天，更加美丽，更加欢乐！
