　　National Economic Construction Bond Redemption Lottery Held in Wuhan Yesterday
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th. The 1958 National Economic Construction Bond redemption lottery was held in Wuhan this afternoon. At this lottery, redemptions were drawn for four types of bonds: the fourth redemption lottery for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, the third redemption lottery for the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, the second redemption lottery for the 1956 National Economic Construction Bonds, and the first redemption lottery for the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds.
    More than a thousand representatives of workers, soldiers, farmers, industrialists, and residents from the seven provinces and cities of Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Wuhan participated in today's redemption lottery. The Ministry of Finance invited representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delegated by the Hubei Provincial Trade Union and the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, respectively, to attend and conduct the lottery. The Fifth Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Supervision delegated representatives from the Hubei Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Department of Supervision, respectively, to jointly supervise the lottery with representatives from all sectors of society. According to the regulations of the National Economic Construction Bonds, a total of ten winning numbers for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds and five winning numbers each for the 1955, 1956, and 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds were drawn at the meeting.
    Bei Zhongxuan, Assistant Minister of Finance, who presided over today's redemption lottery, said in his speech: The four types of National Economic Construction Bonds issued during the First Five-Year Plan absorbed a portion of the necessary funds for national construction. According to preliminary statistics, the funds absorbed by the state through the issuance of bonds over the past four years account for about one-twentieth of the total expenditure on economic construction during the same period. The total investment in the world-renowned Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is 138.4 million yuan, while the actual amount of bonds completed nationwide last year could build about five Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge projects.
    Bei Zhongxuan pointed out: People buying bonds is a good thing that is "beneficial to both the public and the private, achieving two goals with one action." Bondholders, while supporting national economic construction, can receive a certain amount of interest income in addition to recovering their principal upon maturity. This year, the state will pay more than 98 million yuan in bond interest, totaling more than 270 million yuan including the principal to be repaid. He hopes that people from all walks of life will complete and overfulfill this year's National Economic Construction Bond task with high socialist enthusiasm, accumulating more funds for the country.
    Representatives from the Hubei Provincial Trade Union, the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, the PLA troops stationed in Wuhan, and various provinces and cities spoke at the meeting, expressing their intention to enthusiastically purchase the 1958 National Economic Construction Bonds in the spirit of building the country and managing households diligently and frugally.

　　国家经济建设公债还本抽签大会
    昨日在武汉市举行
    新华社武汉5日电　国家经济建设公债1958年度还本抽签大会，今天下午在武汉市举行。在这次抽签大会上，一共举行了四种公债的还本抽签，即1954年国家经济建设公债的第四次还本抽签；1955年国家经济建设公债的第三次还本抽签；1956年国家经济建设公债的第二次还本抽签和1957年国家经济建设公债的第一次还本抽签。
    河南、湖南、湖北、江西、广东、广西、武汉七个省、市的职工、部队、农民、工商界代表和居民一千多人参加了今天的还本抽签大会。由财政部邀请中华全国总工会、中华全国工商业联合会所委托的湖北省工会和省工商业联合会推定代表各一人到会执行抽签，国务院第五办公室和监察部所委托的湖北省人民委员会和省监察厅指派代表各一人与各界到会代表共同监督抽签。根据国家经济建设公债条例的规定，会上一共抽出1954年国家经济建设公债中签号码十个，1955年、1956年和1957年国家经济建设公债中签号码各五个。
    主持今天还本抽签大会的财政部部长助理贝仲选致词说：在第一个五年计划期间发行的四种国家经济建设公债，为国家建设事业吸收了一部分必要的资金。据初步统计，四年来国家通过发行公债吸收资金约占同期经济建设费用支出总和的二十分之一。举世闻名的武汉长江大桥全部工程投资总额为一亿三千八百四十万元，而全国去年实际完成的公债数字约可以修建五个武汉长江大桥的全部工程。
    贝仲选指出：人民购买公债是
  “公私两利，一举两得”的好事情。购债人在支援国家经济建设的同时，除到期收回本金外，还可以得到一定的利息收入。今年国家就将偿付九千八百余万元公债利息，连应还的本金共达二亿七千多万元。他希望各界人民以高度的社会主义热情完成和超额完成今年的国家经济建设公债任务，为国家积累更多的资金。
    湖北省工会、省工商业联合会、解放军驻武汉部队以及各省、市代表都在大会上发言，表示要本着勤俭建国、勤俭持家的精神，踊跃购买1958年的国家经济建设公债。
