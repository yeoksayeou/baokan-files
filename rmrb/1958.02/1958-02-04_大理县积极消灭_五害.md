Dali County Actively Eliminates the "Five Pests"

    (Our report) Yunnan Province's Dali County has decided to completely and cleanly eliminate the "Five Pests" (snails, rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes) this year, transforming Dali into a "Five Pests-Free" county.

    Currently, the county has already produced Toupu and Baohe, two "Five Pests-Free" villages, and Fotang, Xinyi, Yinqiao, and Panxi, four snail-free communes, and has already stopped the spread of schistosomiasis. At the same time, the entire county has basically eliminated diseases such as plague, smallpox, and cholera. Currently, a high tide of eliminating the "Five Pests" has been set off in every township and commune in the county. All departments and agricultural cooperatives have established "Five Pests" elimination headquarters, implementing a system of responsibility areas and contracted sections to thoroughly encircle and suppress the "Five Pests." The specific steps are: the period before the Spring Festival is designated as a "Five Pests" elimination assault month, and combined with water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, focusing on digging out snails. Around the Spring Equinox, the main focus is on a concentrated assault on the "Four Pests," comprehensively catching rats, plugging holes, and filling nests. Before the autumn harvest, the main focus is on exterminating adult mosquitoes and flies. After the autumn harvest, clean up thoroughly, completely eliminate the "Five Pests," and transform Dali County into a "Five Pests-Free" county.

　　大理县积极消灭“五害”
    本报讯　云南省大理县决定在今年内，彻底、干净地消灭“五害”（钉螺、老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子），把大理变为“无五害”县。
      目前，全县已出现头铺、保和两个“无五害”村，佛堂、新邑、银桥、蟠溪等四个无钉螺社，并且已经制止了血吸虫病的传染。同时，全县已经基本上消灭了鼠疫、天花、霍乱等疾病。目前该县乡乡社社都掀起了灭“五害”的高潮。各个部门和农业社，都成立了灭“五害”的指挥部，实行分区、分片包干到底的办法，全面围剿“五害”。具体步骤是：春节前一段时间订为灭“五害”的突击月，并且结合修水利、积肥，着重挖钉螺。春分前后主要是突击灭“四害”，全面捕鼠、塞洞、填窝。秋收前主要是扑灭成蚊、成蝇。秋收后扫尾，彻底肃清“五害”，使大理县变为“无五害”县。
