How did Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory Start From Scratch?
Speech by Delegate Shen Ce

Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory in Zhejiang was opened on May 1, 1954. At the time of its opening, it had only ten unemployed workers and 1,150 yuan in unemployment relief funds allocated by the government. In just three years, by 1957, the factory had grown to more than 160 workers with 57,500 yuan in capital. The output value had increased sixteen-fold compared to the opening. In 1956, it turned over more than 46,000 yuan in profits, and in 1957 it could turn over 120,000 yuan, more than 100 times the original investment.

　　Ten Workers, 1,000 Yuan in Capital; Determination to Start a Factory Never Wavered

When this factory was opened, it had no factory buildings, no machinery, and the ten workers had no experience with paper pulp. They did not understand the technology, and the 1,150 yuan was not enough to arrange everything. In short, there was a pile of difficulties in front of them. However, on the one hand, the problem of finding a way out for unemployed workers had to be solved, and on the other hand, they saw that large-scale socialist construction had begun. Paper pulp was a material used in basic construction, so as long as they persisted, there would be prospects for development. Therefore, their determination to start this factory never wavered. They adopted the method of relying on the masses and consulting with the masses to overcome many difficulties and solve all the problems that needed to be solved. There were no factory buildings, so they found a dilapidated ancestral hall and several horse stables and renovated them themselves. There was no machinery power, so they borrowed a scrapped fifteen-horsepower diesel engine from a brother factory and repaired it. There were no wooden tanks for pulping, so they made them themselves with old wood. Originally, they also needed to build a water tower, but to save money, they didn't build it and instead had the workers carry river water up bucket by bucket. In this way, the only 1,150 yuan was saved to buy raw materials (rice straw, lime) and purchase and repair tools. Everything was ready, only the technical problem was not solved. So the workers went out to inquire and recruit, and finally invited three farmers who knew how to produce paper pulp to come to the factory to teach. In three months, all ten people learned.

After production began, there was little capital and the production volume was small, so the products could not be stockpiled. Therefore, how to open up sales became a major problem. At that time, the factory did not have administrative management cadres, only a worker group leader. Everyone discussed it and decided to adopt the method of producing while carrying paper pulp out to promote sales. At one point, wages could not be paid. After discussion, the workers decided to do everything possible to ensure the needs of production first and not take wages temporarily. Sometimes even food expenses became difficult, so they borrowed money from relatives and friends to maintain themselves. Some workers simply went home to eat. Despite the extreme difficulties, the workers still said with confidence: "Life is a little hard, but it's not as hard as the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March. The country has a future, and our factory will definitely have a future. The temporary hardship will pass." In winter, snowflakes flew into the workshop and the pulp tanks froze, but they still insisted on production.

　　Leaders and Workers Work Together; Careful Calculation and Thrifty Enterprise

After the difficult start-up phase passed, sales gradually opened up, production developed, and workshops and dormitories were expanded. In order to meet the needs of production development, the leaders successively assigned leading cadres to the factory. Under the influence of the revolutionary spirit of the workers in the factory who started from scratch, these leading cadres always integrated with the workers and adhered to the fine tradition of careful calculation and thrifty enterprise. Their production workshops were tile-roofed mud walls, and the dormitories were grass-roofed mud walls, no different from the residential buildings of local residents. Moreover, the work of building mud walls, leveling the ground, installing electric lights, and making thatched tiles was all done by the cadres and workers themselves. Originally, it was planned to use new bricks to pave the floor, but after submitting it to the workers for discussion, it was changed to using self-collected old bricks to pave the floor, saving several hundred yuan. Originally, it was necessary to spend more than 1,000 yuan to build a grass soaking pool, but after discussion by the workers, it was decided to do it themselves, and as a result, it only cost more than 50 yuan, and it could still be used. In the summer, the leaders of the factory did not neglect the work of preventing heatstroke and cooling down because of frugality. They used their own brains to manufacture wooden electric fans, which were both practical and economical. In administrative management, they also truly eliminated the "official airs" and consistently maintained the fine tradition of doing both production and administrative work when the factory was built. Up to now, no departments have been established. Administrative management personnel hold multiple positions, such as financial accountants who also manage planning, finished product management, and ship allocation. The number of people only accounts for 6% of the total number of employees in the factory.

This is how Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory has continuously overcome difficulties, accumulating production funds bit by bit and developing.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly instructed us to have a socialist revolutionary drive, to eliminate "official airs," to rely on the masses, to overcome difficulties in every possible way, and to thoroughly implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in all aspects. The construction and development process of Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory fully proves the greatness and correctness of these instructions, and provides a vivid example for the development of socialist cause in our province.

The Significance of the Typical Case of Paper Pulp Factory; Timely Socialist Ideological Education for the Masses

The typical case of the paper pulp factory tells us that timely socialist ideological education for the masses is the primary key to adhering to the revolutionary spirit in running an enterprise. The difficulties encountered when the factory was opened could have been solved by reaching out to higher authorities. At that time, some people had envisioned waiting for the state to give money. In response to this situation, the party and government leaders of Jiaxing City conducted education on the First Five-Year Plan for the workers, explaining that the state's funds are mainly used for key construction projects, and it is impossible to fully take care of small projects in various places. This solved the idea of ​​waiting for the state to give money and encouraged them to adhere to the determination to start from scratch and rely on their own efforts. In 1955, the sales of paper pulp encountered difficulties. The leaders promptly carried out education to develop increased production and economy, explaining that the reduction in investment in local basic construction was temporary, and educating them to persist in production, focusing on doing a good job in sales, and publishing the factory's economic situation to employees on a monthly basis so that everyone would know the bottom line, stabilize emotions, and jointly overcome temporary difficulties. In the process of gradual development and expansion of production, they also frequently organized old workers to explain to new workers the process of the factory starting from scratch, guiding workers to compare the past, look at the present, and inspire workers to maintain the glorious tradition of starting from scratch, and to adhere to the determination to continuously overcome difficulties and run the enterprise diligently and thriftily. As a result, some workers consciously criticized some excessive demands in terms of living welfare.

Leaders Share Weal and Woe with the Masses

The typical case of the paper pulp factory also tells us that only when leading cadres set an example, eat, live, and work with the masses, can they completely eliminate "official airs" and better implement the policy of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily. This factory does not have drying equipment, and the paper pulp has to be moved to the field to dry. Whenever the leading cadres have free time, they go barefoot with the workers to turn over, dry, pack, and carry paper pulp. In the event of wind and rain, they go out to rush to collect it, whether it is day or night. Worker Wu A'shuo said: "The leading comrades have no airs, and can work barefoot, which gives us even greater enthusiasm." In terms of life, leading cadres also maintain the same food expenses as the masses. In terms of wage treatment, before the wage reform, the highest monthly wage for workers was 42 yuan, and the factory director's was 47 yuan. After the reform, workers received 47.2 yuan, and the factory director received 51 yuan. The difference was very small, and the workers had no objections. Because the leading cadres can set an example and share weal and woe with the masses, the relationship between the masses and the cadres is very close. In the evening, workers often go to the factory director's and branch secretary's rooms to talk about production, life, or chat. The leaders and the masses are completely integrated, which enables the leading cadres to understand the problems existing in production and the workers' thoughts and lives at any time. In this way, both political and ideological leadership and production leadership are more vivid.

The Road to Local Industrial Development is Broad

The development of Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory further points out to us that the road to local industrial development is very broad. The vast rural areas, mountainous areas, and coastal areas have abundant agricultural and sideline products, mountain forest and local specialties, as well as fishery and animal husbandry products. Many things with very low economic value (such as rice straw) can be used as raw materials for industrial production to manufacture a variety of industrial products needed for national construction or people's lives. Moreover, these small-scale industries have the characteristics of small investment, quick results, and many labor arrangements. Taking materials locally and producing locally can not only revitalize the rural economy, but also meet the needs of national construction.

In our country's increasingly in-depth development of the people's rectification movement and the new situation of great leap forward in the socialist cause, in order to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "running factories diligently and thriftily, running shops diligently and thriftily, running all state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all other undertakings diligently and thriftily," we will focus on the advanced examples of Jiaxing Paper Pulp Factory adhering to the socialist revolutionary drive, starting from scratch, and leading cadres and workers eating, living, and working together, and promote them to all enterprises, institutions, organizations, and schools in the province, and to all cities and villages in the province. We believe that through the promotion of this advanced example, it will generate a huge inspiring force to completely change our current production and work appearance and promote the further development of the socialist cause.

    嘉兴纸筋厂怎样白手起家？
    沈策代表的发言
    浙江嘉兴纸筋厂是在一九五四年五月一日开厂的。开厂时只有十个失业工人和政府拨给的失业工人救济金一千一百五十元。仅仅三年工夫，到一九五七年，这个厂已经发展到一百六十多个工人，五万七千五百元资金，产值比开厂时增长了十六倍，一九五六年上缴利润四万六千余元，一九五七年可以上缴十二万元，超过原投资的一百多倍。
    工人十名　资金千元  办厂劲头　决不动摇
    这个厂开办时，没有厂房，没有机器设备，十个工人过去都没有搞过纸筋，不懂这门技术，一千一百五十元资金也不够安排。总之，摆在面前的是一大堆困难。但是，一方面由于失业工人的出路问题总要解决，一方面他们看到大规模的社会主义建设开始了，纸筋是基本建设中的一种材料，只要坚持搞下去，总有发展前途的；因而，一定要办起这个厂来的劲头始终没有动摇。他们采取了依靠群众、与群众商量的办法克服了许多困难，解决了所有需要解决的问题。没有厂房，找到一座破祠堂和几间马棚自己整修一下解决了；没有机器动力，向兄弟厂借到一部已经报废的十五匹马力柴油引擎，修理一下也解决了；没有捞浆用的木槽，自己动手用旧木料做；本来还需要造一个水塔，为了省钱，不造了，改由工人自己一担担的挑上河水来用。就这样，把仅有的一千一百五十元资金都省下来买原料（稻草、石灰）和购置、修理工具。一切都齐全了，只有技术问题还未解决，于是工人们四出打听招聘，终于请到三个会生产纸筋的农民来厂传授，三个月时间，十个人全学会了。
    生产开始以后，资金少，生产量不大，产品积压不起，因此，如何打开销路又成了大问题。那时厂里还没有行政管理干部，只有一个工人小组长，大家一商量，就采取一边生产、一边掮了纸筋外出推销的办法。一度发不出工资，工人们经过商议，就想一切办法首先保证生产需要，暂时不拿工资。有时连伙食费都发生困难，就分头向亲戚朋友借钱来维持，有的工人干脆回家吃饭。尽管在极度困难的情况下，工人们还满怀信心地说：“生活苦一点，总比不过红军二万五千里长征那样苦，国家有前途，我们这爿厂也一定有前途，暂时的苦头，熬熬就过去了”。冬天雪花飘进工场，纸浆槽结了冰，他们还是照样坚持生产。
    领导同工人一齐动手  精打细算勤俭办企业
    艰难的草创阶段过去以后，销路逐渐打开，生产发展了，还扩建了车间和宿舍。为了生产发展的需要，领导上先后给该厂配上领导干部，这些领导干部在该厂工人白手起家的革命精神影响下，始终同工人打成一片，坚持精打细算、勤俭办企业的优良作风。他们的生产车间是瓦面泥墙，宿舍是草顶泥墙，和当地居民的住宅建筑没有两样，而且筑泥墙、平地面、装电灯、打草片等工作，都是干部和工人自己动手。原来打算用新砖铺地，提交工人讨论以后，改用自行搜集旧砖铺地的办法，节省了好几百元。原来要花一千余元建造浸草池，经过工人讨论，决定自己动手，结果只花了五十多元，同样能用。在夏天，厂的领导上并不因节约而忽视防暑降温工作，他们自己动脑筋制造木质电风扇，既实用又省钱。在行政管理上，他们也真正做到打掉“官气”，一贯保持了建厂时的既搞生产又搞行政工作的优良传统，到现在没有设立课室，行政管理人员都是身兼数职，如财务会计兼管计划，又管成品保管和船只调配，人数只占全厂职工百分之六。
    嘉兴纸筋厂就是这样不断克服困难，一点一滴的积累生产资金发展起来的。
    党中央和毛主席一再指示我们要有一股社会主义的革命干劲，要打掉“官气”，依靠群众，千方百计克服困难，要在一切方面贯彻执行勤俭建国、多快好省的方针。嘉兴纸筋厂的建厂和发展过程，充分证明了这些指示的伟大和正确，并为我们全省社会主义事业的发展提供一个生动的榜样。
    纸筋厂典型事例的意义  及时向群众进行社会主义思想教育
    纸筋厂的典型事例告诉我们，及时地向群众进行社会主义思想教育，是坚持革命精神办企业的首要关键。该厂开厂时遇到的困难，原来也可以采取向上级伸手的办法来解决的，当时就曾经有人设想等待国家拿钱。嘉兴市党政领导上针对这个情况，向工人们进行第一个五年计划的教育，说明国家的资金主要是用在重点建设上，不可能对各地的小项目都有充分的照顾，这就解决了等待国家拿钱的思想，鼓舞他们坚持白手起家、自力更生的决心。一九五五年纸筋的销路发生困难，领导上及时进行开展增产节约的教育，讲清楚地方基本建设投资节减是暂时的，教育他们坚持生产，着重搞好推销工作，并按月将全厂的经济情况向职工公布，让大家知道家底，稳定情绪，共同渡过暂时的困难。在生产逐步发展扩大的过程中，他们还经常组织老工人向新工人讲解本厂白手起家的经过，引导工人比比过去，看看现在，启发工人保持白手起家的光荣传统，坚持不断克服困难，勤俭办企业的决心。从而还使一部分工人自觉地批判了在生活福利方面的一些过高要求。
    领导与群众同甘共苦
    纸筋厂的典型事例还告诉我们，只有领导干部以身作则，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，才能彻底打掉“官气”，才能更好地贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针。这个厂没有烘干设备，纸筋都得搬到场地上晒，领导干部一有空，就赤脚和工人一起去翻晒、打包、扛纸筋，遇到风雨，不论白天和黑夜，都一样出去抢收。工人吴阿小说：“领导同志没有派头，赤了脚一样能干活，我们的劲头更大了。”在生活上领导干部还保持着和群众一样的菜金，在工资待遇上工资改革前工人每月最高四十二元，厂长四十七元，改革以后工人拿四十七元二角，厂长拿五十一元，相距很近，工人都没有意见。由于领导干部能以身作则，与群众共甘苦，群众与干部的关系就很密切。晚上，厂长、支部书记的房里经常有工人去谈生产、生活或者聊天。领导与群众完全打成一片，就使领导干部能够随时了解生产和工人的思想、生活上存在的问题，这样，无论是政治思想领导或生产领导就更加生动了。
    地方工业发展门路广阔
    嘉兴纸筋厂的发展，还进一步向我们指出，地方工业发展的门路是很广阔的，广大农村、山区和沿海地区，有着丰富的农副业产品、山林土特产以及渔、牧业产品，许多经济价值很低的东西（例如稻草），都可以用作为工业生产的原料，制造成国家建设或人民生活需要的多种多样的工业品。而且这些小型工业，还具有投资小、收效快、安排劳动力多的特点，就地取材、就地生产，既能活跃农村经济，又能满足国家建设的需要。
    在我国全民整风运动日益深入开展，社会主义事业正处在大跃进的新形势下，为了坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业”的指示，我们将要着重地把嘉兴纸筋厂坚持社会主义革命干劲，白手起家，领导干部和工人同吃、同住、同劳动的先进事例，向全省所有的企业、机关、团体、学校，全省的城市和乡村普遍推广。我们相信，通过这个先进事例的推广，将产生一种巨大的鼓舞力量，来彻底改变我们当前的生产和工作面貌，促进社会主义事业的进一步发展。
