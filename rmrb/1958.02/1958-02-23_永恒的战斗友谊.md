    Eternal Friendship Forged in Battle
    Feng Zhongyun
    On the occasion of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the birth of the Soviet Red Army, I once again remember and deeply appreciate the help the Soviet Red Army gave us in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War.
    During the fourteen years from the "September 18th Incident" in 1931 to the "August 15th" in 1945, the Soviet Red Army, through various means, politically inspired the people of Northeast China and the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Soviet friends, through their connections, told the comrades of the Chinese Anti-Japanese United Army about the news of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Long March. Later, when we were cut off from the Party Central Committee due to the enemy's blockade, Soviet friends forwarded to us the resolutions of the Party Central Committee and various essays by Chairman Mao, such as "On Protracted War," which strengthened the confidence of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army to persist in the fight.
    In the hard days of battle, we often secretly sent our wounded across the border to the Soviet Union. Soviet comrades treated our wounded as their own relatives, healed them, and then sent them back. Comrade Wang Jun, the director of the Political Department of the Third Detachment of the Third Route Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army, was seriously wounded in an encounter with the enemy in the Huma County area on the Heilongjiang bank, and his leg bone was broken into three sections. We sent him to the Soviet Red Army hospital for treatment. Under normal circumstances, his injury should have been amputated, but the command of the Route Army did not agree. As a result, thanks to the careful treatment of the Soviet military doctors, his leg was saved. He stayed in the hospital for a full year and a half, and with the care of the Soviet doctors and nurses, he finally fully recovered and returned to the army.
    Around 1938, the enemy carried out large-scale burning and killing in the Anti-Japanese base areas along the Heilongjiang River in Hulin, Raohe, and Luobei counties. Tens of thousands of residents in the base areas fled to the Soviet Union with the old and the young. Soviet friends properly settled them in collective farms for production and labor. The families of some commanders and fighters of the Anti-Japanese United Army and rear personnel had to move to the Soviet Union because most of the base areas along the Songhua River were burned down, and all the grain planted in the dense forests was destroyed by the Japanese invaders. They suffered from hunger and cold in the severe winter. Later, these hundreds of family members of the Anti-Japanese United Army soldiers, the wounded and sick, and the rear personnel all received the love and care of the Soviet people.
    The personnel of the Anti-Japanese United Army who transferred to the Soviet Union received political and military education with the help of the Soviet Red Army, improved their level of Marxism-Leninism, and also learned modern military technology. Later, when the Soviet Red Army liberated Northeast China in 1945, these comrades returned to their motherland and joined the Anti-Japanese United Army that continued to fight in Northeast China, cooperating with the Soviet Red Army to liberate Northeast China. The Soviet Union also awarded them medals and awards for the Patriotic War.
    It was precisely because of the assistance of the Soviet Red Army that the comrades of the Anti-Japanese United Army were able to survive and contribute their strength to the Northeast Liberation War and the construction of the motherland. We thank the Soviet people and the Soviet Red Army for their warm assistance, and we will always be grateful for the friendship of the great Soviet Union. We will always cherish this eternal friendship.

    永恒的战斗友谊
    冯仲云
    在欢庆苏联红军诞生四十年的时候，我再一次想起了并且深深感激在东北的抗日战争中苏联红军给我们的帮助。
    从1931年“九·一八”到1945年“八·一五”的十四年中，苏联红军，通过了各种办法，在政治上鼓舞了东北的人民和东北抗日联军。中国工农红军在万里长征的消息，苏联友人经过关系告诉中国抗日联军的同志们。后来，由于敌人的封锁，我们同党中央隔绝的时候，苏联友人给我们转送来党中央的决议和毛主席的各种论文，例如“论持久战”等，这样使东北抗日联军增强了信心坚持战斗。
    在艰苦的战斗的日子里，我们常把自己的伤员偷偷地越境送到苏联。苏联同志把我们的伤员当作自己的亲人一样，医治好了，再送回来。抗日联军第三路军第三支队的政治部主任王均同志有一次在黑龙江岸呼玛县一带和敌人的遭遇战中，负了重伤，腿骨打断成三节。我们将他送到了苏联红军的医院里养伤。按照一般情况他的创伤是完全应该截肢的，但是没有得到路军司令部同意。结果由于苏联军医的悉心治疗，他的腿保全住了，在医院里整整住了一年半，在苏联大夫与护士的百般照顾下，终于完全恢复了健康，回到了部队。
    1938年前后，敌人在虎林、饶河、萝北各县，黑龙江沿岸的抗日根据地里大烧大杀，根据地的成千成万的居民扶老携幼逃到苏联境内。苏联的友人把他们妥善的安置到集体农庄生产劳动。抗联一部分指战员的家属和后方人员由于松花江沿岸根据地大部被烧毁，在密林里种的粮食也全部被日本侵略者打毁，严冬无粮，饥寒交迫，不得不转移到苏联去。后来这数百名抗联军队的家属和伤病员和后方工作人员都得到了苏联人民的爱护和关心。
    转移到苏联去的抗日联军人员，在苏联红军的帮助下，受到了政治上和军事上的教育，提高了马列主义的水平，也学习了现代的军事技术。后来这些同志在1945年苏联红军解放东北时，他们又回到了祖国，和在东北继续作战的抗日联军会合在一起，配合苏联红军解放了东北。苏联并且授予了他们卫国战争的勋章和奖章。
    正是由于苏联红军的救助，抗联的同志才能生存下来，才能在东北解放战争和祖国建设事业中贡献自己的力量。我们感谢苏联人民、苏联红军对我们的热情援助，永远感谢伟大苏联的友谊，我们一定永远珍贵这个永恒的友谊。
