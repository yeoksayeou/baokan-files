Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 14th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda, in a radio address on the evening of the 13th explaining the government's recent measures to deal with the Central Sumatran rebel group, called on the people to help the government complete the task of restoring national normalcy and carrying out construction.

Prime Minister Djuanda guaranteed in his speech that the government will continue to fight together with the people to abolish the Round Table Agreements and liberate West Irian.

The Indonesian government also issued a statement on the evening of the 13th, similar in content to Prime Minister Djuanda's speech, condemning the "ultimatum" issued by Hussein and other rebel elements. The statement believes that this is a conspiracy to shake the Indonesian armed forces and the foundation of the country at a time when the government and people are engaged in the struggle to liberate West Irian and combat colonialist aggression. The government cannot ignore this kind of action.

The statement said that the measures taken against Hussein and other rebel elements are also a warning to their followers to bring them back to the right path.

Dahlan Djambek, spokesman for the Central Sumatran rebel group, mentioned again in a broadcast on Padang Radio on the 13th the "ultimatum" put forward by the rebels to the government, saying that 10:30 pm on the 15th was the "deadline" for the central government to respond. He also repeated Secretary of State Dulles' hackneyed tune, attacking President Sukarno's proposed "guided democracy" policy.

    朱安达总理发表广播演说
    号召人民帮助政府恢复正常局面
    保证将继续进行解放西伊里安的斗争
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达在13日晚上发表广播演说解释政府最近采取的对付中苏门答腊叛乱集团的措施时，呼吁人民帮助政府完成恢复国家正常局面和进行建设的任务。
    朱安达总理在演说中保证，政府将继续同人民一起，进行废除圆桌协定和解放西伊里安的斗争。
    印度尼西亚政府在13日晚间还发表了一项内容同朱安达总理的演说相似的声明，谴责侯赛尼和其他叛乱分子所发出的“最后通牒”。声明认为，这是一个阴谋在政府和人民正在进行解放西伊里安的斗争来对付殖民主义进攻的时候，动摇印度尼西亚武装力量和国家基础的行动。政府对这种行动不能置之不理。
    声明说，对侯赛尼和其他叛乱分子所采取的措施也是对于他们的跟随者的一种警告，以便把他们拉上正路。
    中苏门答腊叛乱集团的发言人达兰·贾姆贝克13日在巴东电台广播时再一次提到叛乱分子向政府提出的“最后通牒”，他说，15日下午十时三十分以前是中央政府答复的“期限”。他还重复美国国务卿杜勒斯的滥调，攻击苏加诺总统所提出的“有领导的民主”的方针。
