The Magnificent Plan of Anshan Workers
    Representatives: Wang Chonglun, Hu Zhaosen, Meng Tai, Shao Xianghua, Zhang Mingshan, et al.
    We fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and suggest that the congress adopt these reports.
    After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the great call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer, all of us in Anshan felt delighted and inspired, and at the same time felt that our responsibility was glorious and heavy. We are making every effort to tap the potential for increased production with a high degree of labor enthusiasm on the basis of the rectification campaign, to produce steel more, faster, better, and more economically. We are determined to respond to the call of the state at any time and complete any task given to us by the state.
    In the first Five-Year Plan, Anshan Iron and Steel, as the first iron and steel base, has developed into a huge modern joint enterprise under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the vigorous support of the people of the whole country, and the hard work of all employees; at the same time, it has also trained a contingent of working class with socialist consciousness and mastering a certain level of new technology. In the future, under the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer, through the rectification movement, the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of all employees in Anshan will inevitably be greatly improved, and there will be a great leap forward on the production and construction front; secondly, our victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan has prepared a relatively sufficient material foundation for the great leap forward in production in the future. During the first Five-Year Plan period, Anshan Iron and Steel has completed forty-one major projects, including two mines, seven ore dressing and sintering plants, ten coke ovens, six blast furnaces, two steelmaking plants, eight rolling mills, and three refractory material plants, which increased Anshan Iron and Steel's production capacity by 1.88 million tons of pig iron, 1.72 million tons of steel, and 1.4 million tons of steel products. The progress of our construction projects is also very fast. For example, it only took seven months to completely renovate an automated blast furnace. According to the evaluation of Soviet experts, the quality of the project has also reached the international level. Such a construction speed cannot be achieved by any capitalist country. Anshan Iron and Steel's production has developed rapidly. In 1957, the output of pig iron was 4.06 times that of 1952, steel was 3.73 times, and steel products were 4.34 times. In terms of technical and economic indicators, the effective volume utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnace was 0.873 cubic meters per ton in 1952, which has been reduced to 0.709 in 1957; the daily steel production per square meter of hearth area of the open hearth furnace in the First Steelmaking Plant has increased from 5.78 tons in 1952 to 7.878 tons in 1957. These indicators have already exceeded the level of Britain. The production of our various rolling mills has also increased rapidly. Even the newly built factories have greatly exceeded the original design capacity shortly after being put into production. For example, the output of the large-scale plant in 1957 exceeded the design capacity by 230,000 tons. The seamless steel tube plant exceeded 20,000 tons, and the thin plate plant exceeded 28,000 tons. Many products that our country could not produce at all in the past, such as large-scale steel products and seamless steel pipes, can now be produced.
    Now the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel are deeply carrying out the rectification movement. We are using the revolutionary spirit of riding the wind and waves and striving for the top, to eliminate the three isms, overcome right-leaning conservatism, complacency, localism and other ideas, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, tap potential, and formulate a more advanced plan for increasing production and practicing economy for ourselves in accordance with the Party Central Committee's comprehensive policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. After mass discussions, it has now been preliminarily determined that this year our pig iron output will increase by 545,000 tons compared with last year, an increase of 16.1%; steel production will increase by 25.4% compared with last year; and steel production will increase by 16.9% compared with last year. In terms of capital construction, employees also proposed to complete this year's three major projects one month ahead of schedule. In order to achieve these goals, a very active new atmosphere has emerged in all aspects of production activities for many employees. For example, competitions have been launched in each furnace of the First Steelmaking Plant, and the average smelting time of each furnace of steel has been shortened by 18 minutes compared with December last year. Another example is the Second Ore Dressing Section of the Dagushan Iron Mine. After criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, the output has also increased day by day. The daily plan was 3,226 tons, and 3,278 tons were completed on January 9, 3,567 tons were completed on the 10th, and 3,802 tons were completed on the 11th. There are many such examples.
    During the rectification movement, the broad masses of employees also exposed many shortcomings in our enterprise, mainly that the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and running enterprises diligently and frugally, was not implemented deeply and comprehensively enough. We often emphasized more and faster, and neglected better and more economical, and the phenomenon of waste is serious. Prominent examples are: in the past five years, 600,000 square meters of employee housing was newly built. Due to construction waste and some housing costs being too high, an additional investment of 10.39 million yuan was spent; the open-pit stripping project of the Gongchangling Iron Mine has already invested 400,000 yuan, but it had to be scrapped due to changes in the design plan. Since our rectification has entered the rectification stage, a vigorous anti-waste upsurge has been set off. For example, the Second Steelmaking Plant's costs greatly exceeded the budget last year. Recently, a special discussion on anti-waste was launched. Within four days, employees put forward more than 6,000 comments and posted more than 2,000 big-character posters. Everyone realized that the waste was shocking. Some workers self-criticized and said: "My waste for one day is more than my salary for one month. We must catch up with Britain in fifteen years, and we must fight against waste." Some veteran workers said: "If we waste like this, small factories would have lost all their money long ago. This is the style of a young master." From these examples, it can be seen that, as Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out in his report, the potential for reducing expenditures and increasing income by anti-waste is very large. We must take advantage of the rectification movement and ignite the fire of anti-waste to burn all waste phenomena in large and small corners, and establish the idea and atmosphere of building the country diligently and frugally and practicing strict economy among all employees.
    In order to achieve a great leap forward in production, we must also implement some major technical organizational measures, and learn advanced experience from the Soviet Union and fraternal factories and mines to improve technology, so as to better exert the potential capabilities of production equipment. This year, we will further increase the iron content of magnetic separation concentrate and the basicity of sintered ore to create conditions for increasing blast furnace production. Ironmaking itself will further increase the blast temperature and match the necessary humidity. In steelmaking, measures are being taken to shorten boiling time and improve thermal engineering to increase steel output and reduce costs; we must also vigorously improve the quality of steel and smelt new alloy steel grades. In order to improve the mechanical properties of steel products, we are studying the artificial control of the cooling rate after rolling steel. We have mastered the technology of making and using alkaline open-hearth furnace roof bricks made of domestic raw materials, and will soon promote them. In addition, although the operating rate of many factories in Anshan Iron and Steel has gradually increased over the years, it is still relatively low. We will vigorously improve it from aspects such as improving equipment maintenance. The difference between the advanced and backward technical and economic indicators of our company is very large, and it is still lagging behind the advanced enterprises in the Soviet Union. Therefore, we must launch a climax of competition in which the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, and fully tap the potential. In addition, some supplements are also needed in terms of equipment.
    Comrades: All of us at Anshan Iron and Steel deeply feel the importance of our responsibility in realizing the great task of catching up with Britain in fifteen years. In the future, in order to produce more, faster, better, and more economically to support the nationwide upsurge of industrial, agricultural, and transportation construction and vigorously support the construction of steel bases such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel, we must continuously improve our socialist consciousness, work hard to study technology, actively learn from the advanced experience of various fraternal factories and mines, so that we can be trained into working-class fighters who are both red and expert in labor and build socialism. Let us fight with full confidence to overfulfill the tasks of the first year of the second Five-Year Plan and to catch up with or surpass Britain in fifteen years!

　　鞍山职工的雄伟计划
    王崇伦　胡兆森　孟泰　邵象华　张明山等代表
    我们完全同意李先念、薄一波两位副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，并建议大会通过这些报告。
    我们鞍山全体职工听了党中央和毛主席提出在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国这个伟大号召以后，莫不感到欢欣鼓舞，同时感到自己的责任光荣重大。我们正在整风的基础上以高度的劳动热情、千方百计地挖掘增产潜力，更多、更快、更好、更省地生产钢铁，我们决心随时响应国家的号召，完成国家所给予我们的任何任务。
    鞍钢在第一个五年计划中，作为第一个钢铁基地，在党中央和毛主席英明正确的领导、苏联全面无私的帮助、全国人民大力的支援和全体职工的辛勤劳动下，已经发展成为一个巨大的现代化的联合企业；同时还锻炼出一支具有社会主义觉悟和掌握一定新技术水平的工人阶级队伍。今后在党中央和毛主席提出的，关于在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召下，通过整风运动，我们鞍山全体职工的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性必然大大提高，在生产和建设的战线上，一定会大大跃进；其次，我们胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，给今后生产大跃进准备了比较充分的物质基础。在第一个五年计划期间，鞍山建成了包括两个矿山、七个选矿烧结厂、十座炼焦炉、六座高炉、两个炼钢厂、八个轧钢厂和三个耐火材料厂在内的四十一项重大工程，它们使鞍钢的生产能力增加了生铁一百八十八万吨，钢一百七十二万吨，钢材一百四十万吨。我们建设工程的进度也是很快的，例如彻底改建一座自动化高炉只用了七个月。按苏联专家的评价，工程的质量也达到了国际水平。这样的建设速度是任何资本主义国家所达不到的。鞍钢生产发展很快，一九五七年生铁产量为一九五二年的四点零六倍，钢为三点七三倍，钢材为四点三四倍。在技术经济指标方面，鞍钢高炉的有效容积利用系数，一九五二年为每吨零点八七三立方米，到一九五七年已经降低到零点七零九；第一炼钢厂平炉每平方米炉床面积的每昼夜产钢量从一九五二年的五点七八吨提高到一九五七年的七点八七八吨。这些指标，都已经超过英国的水平。我们轧钢各厂的生产也迅速增长，即使新建的厂，在投入生产后不久也大大地超过了原设计能力，例如一九五七年大型厂产量超过设计能力二十三万吨。无缝厂超过二万吨，薄板厂超过二万八千吨。许多我国过去完全不能生产的产品，如大型钢材、无缝钢管等，也能够生产了。
    现在鞍山职工，正在深入地开展整风运动。我们正以乘风破浪、力争上游的革命精神，打掉三个主义，克服右倾保守、骄傲自满、本位主义等思想，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，挖掘潜力，根据党中央多、快、好、省的全面方针，为自己订出更为先进的增产节约计划。经过群众讨论现在已经初步确定今年我们生铁产量比去年增产五十四万五千吨，即增长百分之十六点一；钢生产比去年增长百分之二十五点四；钢材生产比去年增长百分之十六点九。基本建设方面，职工也提出要将今年三项主要工程提前一个月完成。为了实现这些目标，许多职工在生产活动的各方面已经呈现了一片非常活跃的新气象，例如第一炼钢厂各炉展开了竞赛，每炉钢的熔炼时间平均比去年十二月份缩短了十八分钟。又如大孤山铁矿二选工段，在批判了右倾保守思想以后，产量也逐日上升，日计划是三千二百二十六吨，一月九日完成了三千二百七十八吨，十日完成了三千五百六十七吨，十一日完成了三千八百零二吨，这样的例子是很多的。
    在整风运动中，广大职工还揭发了我们企业中的许多缺点，主要是对于多、快、好、省，勤俭办企业的方针，贯彻执行得不够深入和不够全面。我们往往强调了多、快，忽略了好、省，浪费现象是严重的。突出的例子如：五年来新建的六十万平方米职工住宅，由于施工浪费和一部分住房造价过高，就多花了投资一千零三十九万元；弓长岭铁矿的露天剥岩工程已经投资了四十万元，后因设计方案改变，只好报废。我们整风进入整改阶段以来，已经掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的反浪费高潮。例如，第二炼钢厂去年成本大量超支，最近开展了反浪费专题鸣放，四天内职工们就提出了六千多条意见，贴出了两千多张大字报，大家都认识到浪费是惊人的。有些工人自我检讨说：“我一天的浪费比我一个月的工资还多，我们要十五年赶上英国，非反浪费不可。”有的老工人说：“我们这样浪费，要是小厂子早就赔光了，这是大少爷作风。”从这些例子可以看出，正像李先念副总理报告中所指出的，由反浪费而节减支出，增加收入的潜力是非常大的。我们必须乘整风运动之风，点起反浪费之火，把大大小小各个角落的浪费现象都烧个干净，在全体职工中树立起勤俭建国、厉行节约的思想和风气。
    为了实现生产大跃进，我们还必须实现一些重大的技术组织措施，并向苏联和兄弟厂矿学习先进经验，提高技术，以便更好地发挥生产设备的潜在能力。今年我们将进一步提高磁选精矿的含铁量和烧结矿的碱度，为高炉增产创造条件。炼铁本身将进一步提高鼓风温度并配合必要的湿度。在炼钢方面，正在采取措施缩短沸腾时间，改进热工工作，以提高钢的产量和降低成本；还要大力改进钢的质量，熔炼新的合金钢种。为了提高钢材的机械性能，我们正在研究人工控制轧钢后的冷却速度。我们已经掌握了用本国原料作的碱性平炉炉顶砖的制作和使用的技术，即将加以推广。此外，鞍钢许多厂的作业率虽然逐年有所提高，但仍然是比较低的，将从改进设备维护等方面大力提高。我们的技术经济指标，先进和落后之间相差很大，而且比苏联的先进企业还是落后的，因此必须掀起一个落后赶上先进，先进更先进的竞赛高潮，充分挖掘潜力。另外在设备方面，也需要作某些补充。
    各位代表：我们鞍山全体职工在实现十五年赶上英国的伟大任务中深深感到自己责任的重大。今后为了更多、更快、更好、更省地生产钢铁，支援全国工、农、运输业建设高潮和大力支援武钢、包钢等钢铁基地的建设，我们要不断提高社会主义觉悟，努力钻研技术，积极学习各兄弟厂矿的先进经验，使我们在劳动中锻炼成建设社会主义的又红又专的工人阶级战士。让我们信心百倍地为超额完成第二个五年计划第一年的任务、为十五年赶上或超过英国而奋斗！
