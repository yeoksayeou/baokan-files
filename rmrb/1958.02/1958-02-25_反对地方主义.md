    Opposing Localism
    Wang Kuang
    Localism is a type of sectarianism; like all forms of sectarianism, it is utterly incompatible with communism. Localism presents itself as representing the interests of the local area, but the only thing that truly represents the interests of the masses of people in every locality of the country is communism, the central government's lines and policies. Localism merely represents the individual interests and demands of a small number of ambitious individuals, and can never represent the interests of the locality. Therefore, localists are bound to resist the central government's political and organizational lines and engage in anti-Party, non-organizational activities. This is the case with localism in Guangdong. They do not acknowledge that the land reform and past political movements led by the Party were necessary and correct, vehemently denying the achievements of these movements and exaggerating their shortcomings, attempting to "reverse verdicts" by denying the achievements and exaggerating the shortcomings. They express doubt and opposition to the central government's past policy of relying on the large army, relying on cadres from the south, and having the large army and cadres from the south "take command." They express distrust of the correct leadership of the provincial Party committee, slandering the provincial Party committee's correct cadre policy as "sectarianism." The localism of a small number of local cadres on Hainan Island is even more serious. They use any means, regardless of Party affiliation, to collude with each other, fabricate materials, and undermine Party unity, Party-masses relations, and army-people relations. A tiny number of localists on Hainan Island even colluded with class enemies in Lingao County to cause trouble, plotting to usurp the leadership of the Party and the government. Facts have proved that the existence and growth of localism inevitably leads to the division and disintegration of the Party's unity and combat capability, undermines the implementation of the Party's lines and policies, damages the connection between the Party and the people, corrupts and ruins cadres, and even leads to direct exploitation by counter-revolutionaries, who combine with them to attack the Party and the cause of communism. The serious extent of its harm is difficult to estimate.
    It needs to be pointed out that localists always resist the central government's line and engage in splittism against the central government under the cover of some kind of excuse. Therefore, to eradicate localism, it is necessary to expose their various specious excuses.
    When resisting the central government's political line, localists particularly emphasize the "special characteristics of the locality." They use this so-called "special characteristic" to negate the central government's unified leadership. For example, they argue that because of the "special characteristics of the locality," Guangdong's land reform cannot be the same as in North China, Hainan Island's land reform cannot be the same as on the mainland, and Guangdong's land reform can be resolved through "peaceful land reform" without the need to mobilize the masses. They say that in areas like Hainan Island, "we can liberate it even without the People's Liberation Army." They also say that Guangdong's collectivization "was premature," agricultural production was "rash," the unified purchase and sale "dampened the peasants' enthusiasm for production," and the peasants' lives have not improved but have been "made worse." In short, they one-sidedly emphasize the special characteristics of the locality, ignoring the commonality of the country as a whole, focusing only on the part and not the whole, only talking about decentralization and not centralization. Of course, this kind of excuse is untenable. Because the special and the general, the part and the whole, decentralization and centralization, are all unities of opposites. Without any one of these aspects, the other aspect would not exist. And for a fighting and unified Party, commonality, the whole, and centralization are above all else. Everything must be subordinate to the Party's unity, centralization, and the interests of the whole. We acknowledge that every region has its special characteristics, but we must never and should never use it as a basis for resisting the central government's policies and unified and centralized leadership. In the case of Guangdong, there are certainly special characteristics, such as being adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, being a front line of national defense, having a large number of overseas Chinese, having a developed commodity economy, having many cash crops, and having a rich revolutionary tradition. These can all be said to be Guangdong's "special characteristics." But the question is: does the existence of these special characteristics mean that there is no need for the People's Liberation Army to come and liberate it, no need to carry out land reform, or no need to boldly mobilize the masses to overthrow the landlord class? Is there no need to implement agricultural collectivization? Can we refuse to specifically implement the central government's line and policies? Is it the case that in Guangdong, resolutely implementing the central government's line and policies is a mistake, while adhering to the right-leaning line of peaceful land reform, which localists once implemented, is correct? Facts have proven that even with all these special characteristics, Guangdong not only should not and cannot resist the central government's line and policies, but should even more bravely and resolutely implement the central government's line and policies. For example, without rapidly mobilizing the masses to carry out land reform and mobilizing the broad masses of peasants, it would be impossible to consolidate national defense, impossible to unite the broad masses of overseas Chinese, and impossible to develop agricultural production. These are all indisputable facts.
    When resisting the central government's organizational line, localists intentionally distort the principle of "localization of cadres" as an excuse to exclude outside cadres. Localization of cadres originally includes two aspects: cultivating and promoting local cadres and having outside cadres become familiar with local conditions and take root in the locality. It does not contain any implication of excluding outside cadres. But localists interpret it as cadres needing to be "purely" local people, with "people from other provinces giving way to people from this province." They completely do not want to understand or admit that the localization of cadres is not the highest principle of the Party's cadre policy. The highest principle of cadre policy is first and foremost communization. Both outside cadres and local cadres must first be communized. The promotion of cadres, whether local or outside, must be subordinate to the principle of both ability and integrity. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said when discussing the Party's cadre issue: "It should be understood that the Party's special emphasis on and cultivation of a certain type or several types of cadres in a certain period is based on political reasons, based on the needs of the development of the objective situation, and not based on anything else, and even less because a certain type or several types of cadres are particularly lovable or superior. The Party's cadre issue and cadre policy should be understood from a political perspective, not just from an organizational perspective, and even less should the cadre issue be understood solely from the perspective of the cadre issue." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party") Localists completely do not understand these things. In their view, the implementation of "cadre localization" is because local cadres have some "special" qualities, while "political reasons" and "the needs of the development of the objective situation," etc., are completely abandoned. It is clear that they have violated the central government's instructions.
    When localists implement resisting the central government's organizational line, they also claim that "outside cadres do not understand the situation." Of course, due to language barriers and different living habits, it is not as easy for outside cadres to become familiar with the local situation as it is for local cadres. But this is not an absolute and insurmountable difficulty. Given time and assistance, outside cadres can also learn the local language and become accustomed to the lives of the local masses. Moreover, there is a more important issue of how to truly understand the situation, that is, the issue of what kind of stance, viewpoint, and method to use to understand the situation. Even if you are a local person and live in the countryside your whole life, if you stand on the position of the landlord class or any other exploiters, you will never understand the lives and demands of the peasants, as well as the true situation in the countryside. Conversely, a person with a correct class stance and rich experience in rural work, even if he is from another place, will still be able to understand the true situation of the peasants and the entire countryside. It can be seen that the so-called "not understanding the situation" is by no means a problem unique to outside cadres. Local cadres can also "not understand the situation." This difficulty of outside cadres and this difference between outside cadres and local cadres should not be overemphasized. Using this as a reason to resist the central government's line is, of course, even more unfounded.
    Localists often declare that cadres should be "purely" "local people" because only they can "connect with the local masses." It is undeniable that local cadres and local masses have some conditions that facilitate connection. When they faithfully implement the central government's line and policies and stand on the correct class position, they are representatives of the interests of the masses and have close ties with the masses. But when they resist the central government's line and policies and deviate from the correct class position, they are no longer representatives of the interests of the masses, but become figures who are detached from the masses and divorced from reality. Because only the Party's interests and the Party's line and policies represent the interests of the masses. Leaving the Party's line and policies and leaving the Party's leadership means leaving the masses. This is true of all cadres, without exception. In fact, all localists who are self-important, complacent, and arrogant are, without exception, the most detached from the masses. The "masses" they remember are often only their so-called "old subordinates," "fellow villagers," and even some backward and degenerate "old acquaintances." And the broad masses of workers and peasants who have truly been tempered by the struggles of the revolutionary movement, the true people's masses, are unrelated to them. The masses always adopt an attitude of "respect but keep at a distance" towards them. From this, it can be seen that although localists are also local people, they do not have any real connection with the local masses.
    Localists often use the excuse of "not cutting off history" and "taking care of history" to separate local revolutionary work from the scope of the Party's overall work, to sever the local revolutionary history from the Party's entire revolutionary cause, and then demand that others not cut off their "history" and take care of their "history." This way of saying that the Party's history and cause is the history and cause of individuals or a part of the people is obviously very wrong. Starting from such a wrong proposition, it is natural to believe that the positions of certain people in the locality, the establishment of a certain army, and the rights of a certain region are sacred and inviolable, and only they themselves are allowed to maintain and inherit them from generation to generation. It can be seen that this slogan is only an excuse, a synonym, for them to ask the Party for fame and status. It is very clear that the Party's revolutionary cause and revolutionary history cannot be divided by anyone. The revolutionary work in any region and the revolutionary history in any region were created and established under the leadership of the Party's revolutionary line and with the support of the Party's revolutionary forces. Even in Hainan Island, which is far away from the central government, without the leadership and support of the Party Central Committee, let alone "the red flag not falling for twenty-three years," it would be difficult to do even if it did not fall for twenty-three months. It is extremely arrogant to sever the revolutionary history of a region from the Party's entire history and demand that it become a system in itself. Secondly, history cannot and should not be cut off. This is an objective requirement. But there are correct, beneficial, and good things in history, as well as incorrect, harmful, and bad things. For the former, we must inherit them and carry them forward; but for the latter, why shouldn't we learn from them, "cut them off," and correct them? This is precisely the requirement of the objective law of historical development, and it is an indispensable aspect of inheriting and developing history, and it is by no means "cutting off history." If this statement refers to the relationship between outside cadres and local cadres, then it is even more absurd. For example, the history of the Guangdong Party organization (including the Hainan Party organization) was initially created jointly by outside cadres and local cadres. The first leaders to shed blood and sacrifice themselves in Guangdong, such as Xiao Chunu and Zhang Tailei, were not from Guangdong. The situation in Hainan was the same. Our revolution went from south to north, and then from north to south. From this point of view, there has long been no distinction between local and outside. If we want to talk about history, this page of history should not be cut off. It should be recognized that the Party has a full and correct assessment of the revolutionary history of every region, and will never obliterate the merits of everyone in revolutionary history. But if you want to exaggerate your achievements in a certain region without principle, or take the achievements of the Party and the people's masses as your own achievements, taking the Party's credit as your own, and use this to confront the central government, then it is absolutely not allowed.
    Localism within the Party has its social, historical, and ideological roots. Generally speaking, it is a product of the combination of extreme individualism and feudal sectarianism.
    Some people once independently led and persisted in the struggle in a region, have certain historical merits, have a group of old subordinates, and have a certain mass prestige. So they become arrogant, exaggerate their own merits, take the Party's credit as their own, develop personal heroism and feudal separatist ideas, and attempt to maintain their personal honor, status, and power in their minds forever. Therefore, he can only be a leader and does not allow people who can adhere to principles and have more experience and ability to lead him. Localism in Guangdong, especially in Hainan, arose in this situation.
    However, such attempts are incompatible with the Party's principles. After the unification of the country, in the context of carrying out the socialist revolution and large-scale planned economic construction, if we persist in this personal ambition, we will inevitably embark on the anti-Party and anti-socialist road. Once they embark on such a road, they will not consider the interests of the Party or truly consider the interests of the locality when dealing with any issue. They consider all issues from the standpoint of individualism, from personal honor, status, power, and from personal political ambitions. Therefore, all serious localists, even though they sometimes hold high positions and receive the Party's care and respect, always think that the Party and others do not trust him and do not respect him. Their personal ambitions can never be satisfied. In fact, the more the Party trusts him and reuses him, the more his personal ambitions expand, the more arrogant he becomes, and the more dissatisfied he becomes, and the more intense the anti-Party arrogance of localism becomes.
    Generally speaking, people with bourgeois individualism and feudalism (regional concepts, nepotism, etc.) and all other backward consciousness are easily captured by localism. In order to achieve some of their personal goals, they will consciously or unconsciously stand under the banner of localism, cheer for it, spread rumors, expand its momentum, and even directly participate in its sectarian small group activities, transforming themselves into localists.
    In the past year or two, localism has grown to some extent in many places. This is inseparable from the domestic and international political situation. Domestically, after the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production achieved a decisive victory, the socialist revolution in the political and ideological aspects entered a climax period, and the class struggle was very sharp and intense for a certain period of time. This situation cannot but be reflected in the Party. The growth of some localism within the Party is precisely a reflection of the intensification of domestic class struggle within the Party. Internationally, a revisionist countercurrent has emerged within the communist movement, which cannot but affect our Party.
    All of these illustrate that the emergence of localism has its far-reaching reasons. A comprehensive analysis of the root causes of localism can enable us to more deeply understand its essence and harm, and help us find the correct methods to overcome and eradicate it.
    In its past instructions on ideological issues within the Party, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have pointed out that it is necessary to overcome all sectarianism, mountain-stronghold mentality, small-group mentality, and localism, because these erroneous ideological tendencies are not conducive to Party unity. In February 1954, the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party stated: "At this critical historical juncture when our country is implementing socialist transformation, it is extremely necessary to awaken all comrades in the Party to pay more attention to enhancing revolutionary vigilance and further strengthen Party unity." The resolution pointed out the dangerousness of the kind of arrogance, exaggeration of personal role, emphasis on personal prestige, and even the tendency to regard the regions and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms among some cadres in the Party, especially senior cadres. The resolution requires: We must regard the Party organizations and their work in any region and any department as an inseparable part of the entire Party and its work under the unified leadership of the Central Committee, oppose any factional ideas, small-group habits, localism, mountain-stronghold mentality, and departmentalism, and oppose any words and actions that hinder the unified leadership of the Central Committee and damage the unity and prestige of the Central Committee. The great practical significance of this resolution has not diminished at all today. On the contrary, the situation within the Party in recent years shows that we must continue to make every effort to implement this resolution in the future. Because localism still exists quite seriously in some areas, the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party specifically mentioned the issue of opposing localism. Every Communist Party member should resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee, have a high degree of righteous indignation towards localism, and resolutely and thoroughly eradicate it.
    In order to thoroughly eradicate localism and its influence, it is necessary to strengthen the communist education of cadres, strengthen political and ideological work within the Party, continuously help cadres strengthen their proletarian stance, establish a communist worldview, improve their Marxist-Leninist ideological level, learn to use the viewpoints and methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to observe and deal with problems, thereby overcoming all bourgeois individualistic stances and viewpoints, and uprooting the roots of localism. As mentioned earlier, the emergence of localism has its far-reaching roots, but the most important of these is the development of bourgeois individualistic thought. Ultimately, localism is a manifestation of extreme individualism. Therefore, thoroughly overcoming bourgeois individualism is of decisive significance for eliminating localism.
    In order to thoroughly eradicate localism and its influence, in a situation where the activities of localists are still very rampant, they have already provoked disputes and confusion within the Party, their various excuses and arguments still have a considerable market, and the many "facts" they have fabricated still blind the eyes and ears of some people, the best method is to systematically launch a large-scale debate. If localists attempt to completely reverse the verdicts on local historical issues, everyone should launch a large-scale debate on historical issues. Through large-scale airing of views, large-scale blooming, large-scale contention, and large-scale debate, presenting the facts and reasoning, we can thoroughly clarify the facts, expose the truth, and distinguish between right and wrong. At the same time, through such a large-scale debate, we can specifically conduct communist and Party line education, so that everyone recognizes that localism is a great enemy of communism and a great enemy of the Party's line, and thus consciously rise up to oppose localism and overcome and eliminate various erroneous thoughts associated with localism, such as individualism, liberalism, departmentalism, decentralization, complacency, feudal sectarian concepts, and feudal regional concepts. It needs to be pointed out that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao proposed opposing localism long ago, and the Party committees at all levels have also studied and discussed it. However, some people have committed localistic errors and then committed them again after being criticized. One of the reasons is that there has not been a large-scale, extensive, and in-depth discussion among all Party members to universally improve the Party's ideological level, so that backward and blind localistic sentiments have no market. Undoubtedly, it is an extremely effective method to firmly oppose localism ideologically through large-scale debate.
    In order to thoroughly eradicate localism and its influence, it is necessary to strengthen education on Party unity and solidarity. Party unity and solidarity, the subordination of the local to the central, the subordination of the part to the whole, and the subordination of the individual to the organization, are the inviolable guiding principles of Party building and the norms of Party life. They are the necessary conditions for building a strong Party with democratic centralism, strict discipline, and unified will. Every Party member should firmly establish a clear concept, that is, "the interests of Party unity are above all else," thereby taking the maintenance and consolidation of Party unity as the standard guiding all their words and actions, that is, saying words that are conducive to Party unity and not saying words that are not conducive to Party unity, doing things that are conducive to Party unity and not doing things that are not conducive to Party unity. In order to achieve this, it is also necessary to strengthen democratic life within the Party, fully develop inner-Party democracy, and improve the principled nature and discipline of Party members, strictly abide by democratic centralism. At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely oppose all erroneous tendencies and behaviors such as disobeying the central government, not respecting the Party's leadership, exaggerating personal roles, individuals transcending the organization, liberalism, small-scale broadcasting, and non-organizational collusion activities. For a Party member, these tendencies and behaviors are illegal and absolutely not allowed. The slightest concession in this regard will bring serious consequences to the Party, leading the Party to a state of division, disintegration, and loss of combat effectiveness, and harming the Party's cause.
    In order to eradicate localism and its influence, strengthening the close unity between local cadres and outside cadres is one of the important links in strengthening Party unity. In the common struggle for the implementation of the central government's line and the realization of communism in the same place, in their respective efforts to move themselves in the direction of communization, the two must respect each other, help each other, and learn from each other. Local cadres must pay special attention to preventing and eliminating all localistic thoughts, emotions, and manifestations, while outside cadres must pay special attention to familiarizing themselves with local conditions, strengthening their connection with local cadres and the masses, and striving to gradually localize themselves.
    In order to thoroughly eradicate localism and its influence, it is necessary to adopt correct attitudes and principles when treating and handling the localistic errors of Party members. This correct attitude and principle is what the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party put forward: "Distinguish between different situations and adopt different policies." At the same time, it should also be noted that localism is basically an internal Party problem. Generally speaking, do not confuse it with bourgeois rightists, and should be appropriately distinguished. Generally, people with localistic emotions and thoughts, once they realize the nature of the error and raise their awareness, will inevitably draw a clear line with localism and participate in the struggle against localism. Therefore, for these comrades, they should be encouraged to consciously and voluntarily conduct ideological self-criticism, relieve ideological burdens, and improve communist awareness. For a small number of people with serious localistic thoughts or even anti-Party actions, if they truly recognize their errors, repent of their past mistakes, conduct in-depth self-criticism, and are determined to correct them, the principle of "strict ideological self-criticism and lenient organizational handling" should also be adopted. However, for individual localistic thoughts that are extremely serious, anti-Party activities that are very resolute, and no signs of true repentance, or those who continue to use double-dealing tactics against the Party, discipline must be strictly enforced. (As for those localistic elements who stand with class enemies and carry out their conspiracies of internal and external collusion when class enemies are frantically attacking the Party, they are of course not an internal Party problem and should be treated differently.) Only in this way can the seriousness of the Party's principles and discipline be maintained and Party unity be safeguarded.
    Localism has serious harm to the Party's cause. The localism that has existed and developed among some Party members in certain regions in recent years has already brought certain losses to the Party. But the Party must not allow the continued development and existence of localism. The Party always exposes them in a timely manner and conducts necessary and serious struggles with them. The complete correctness of the Party Central Committee's political line and organizational line, the unity of all Party members, and the resolute implementation of these correct lines are the fundamental guarantees that the struggle against localism will surely achieve victory and will surely be able to eradicate it thoroughly. At present, in some areas, opposing localism has become an important link in defending and consolidating Party unity and defending and implementing the central government's line. We must use the victory of the struggle against localism to powerfully support the current socialist revolution and socialist construction cause, promote the great upsurge and great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and ensure the smooth implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    反对地方主义
    王匡
    地方主义是一种宗派主义；它同一切宗派主义一样，是与共产主义绝不相容的。地方主义是以代表地方利益的面目出现的，但是，真正代表全国各个地方人民群众利益的，只有共产主义，只有中央的路线、政策；而地方主义只不过是代表少数野心分子个人的利益和要求，决不可能代表地方利益。因此，地方主义者必然要抗拒中央的政治路线和组织路线，进行反党的非组织活动。比如广东的地方主义就是如此。他们不承认党所领导的土地改革和历次政治运动是必要的和正确的，极力否认这些运动的成绩和夸大这些运动的缺点，并企图从否认成绩和夸大缺点上去进行“翻案”；对过去中央提出的依靠大军、依靠南下干部、由大军和南下干部“挂帅”的方针表示怀疑和反对；对省委的正确领导表示不信任；污蔑省委正确的干部政策为“宗派主义”。海南岛少数地方干部的地方主义更为严重，他们不择手段，不分党内外，互相串连，捏造材料，破坏党的团结，破坏党群关系和军民关系。海南岛的极少数的地方主义者竟在临高县和阶级敌人勾结起来闹事，阴谋篡夺党和政府的领导。事实证明，地方主义的存在和滋长的结果，必然是分裂和瓦解党的团结和战斗能力，破坏党的路线政策的执行，破坏党和人民之间的联系，腐蚀和葬送干部，一直到为反革命所直接利用，互相结合起来向党和共产主义事业进攻，其危害的严重程度是难以估计的。
    需要指出，地方主义者违抗中央的路线，向中央闹分散主义，总是在某种借口掩盖下进行的。因此，要肃清地方主义，就必须揭穿他们的各种似是而非的借口。
    在抗拒中央的政治路线时，地方主义者特别强调了“地方的特殊性”。他们以这个所谓“特殊性”来否定中央的统一的领导。比如，他们借口由于“地方的特殊性”，广东的土地改革不能和华北一样，海南岛的土地改革不能和大陆一样，广东的土改可以通过“和平土改”的方式解决问题，用不着发动群众。他们说：像海南岛这样的地区，“没有解放大军我们一样可以解放”。又说：广东的合作化“为时过早”，农业生产“冒进”了，统购统销“打击了农民生产积极性”，农民生活不是改好了而是“改坏”了。总之，他们片面地强调地方的特殊性，不讲全国的共同性，只顾部分，不顾全体，只讲分散，不讲集中。当然，这种借口是站不住脚的。因为特殊和一般、部分和整体、分散和集中，都是对立面的统一，没有其中任何一个方面，另一个方面就不会存在，而作为一个战斗的统一的党来说，共同性、整体和集中，更是高于一切的，一切都要服从党的统一、集中和整体的利益。我们承认，每一个地区都有它的特殊性，但绝不能也不应把它作为抗拒中央的政策和统一集中的领导的根据。就广东来说，地区的特殊性当然是有的，如毗邻港澳、国防前线、华侨众多、商品经济发达、经济作物多和富有革命传统等等，这些都可以说是广东的“特殊性”。但是问题在于：是否有了这些特殊性，就不必解放大军前来解放，不必进行土改，或不必放手发动群众打倒地主阶级？就不必实行农业合作化？就可以拒绝中央的路线和方针的具体实施了呢？是否在广东，坚决执行了中央的路线方针就是犯错误，而坚持地方主义者所曾经执行过的如和平土改的右倾路线，倒是正确的呢？事实证明，广东有了所有这些特殊性，不但不应和不能抗拒中央的路线方针，而且更要勇敢地、坚决地贯彻执行中央的路线方针。比如说：不迅速发动群众搞好土地改革，把广大农民群众动员起来，便无法巩固国防，便无法团结广大侨胞，便不可能发展农业生产。这些都是无可争辩的事实。
    在抗拒中央的组织路线时，地方主义者有意曲解“干部地方化”这一原则，作为排挤外来干部的借口。干部地方化，本来包括培养、提拔本地干部和外来干部熟悉本地情况、在本地生根这两个方面，绝不含有任何排斥外来干部的意味。但地方主义者却把它解释为干部要“清一色”的本地人，“外省人让位给本省人”。他们完全不想懂得也不愿承认，干部地方化并不是党的干部政策的最高原则，干部政策的最高原则首先是共产主义化。无论外来干部和本地干部都必须首先共产主义化。干部的提拔，不论本地与外来，都必须服从德才兼备的原则。刘少奇同志在论及党的干部问题时说过：“应该了解，党在某种时期特别提出重视与培养某一种或某几种干部，是根据于政治上的理由，根据于客观形势发展的需要，而不是根据别的，更不是由于某一种或几种干部有什么特别可爱或高人一等。应该从政治上来理解党的干部问题与干部政策，而不仅仅从组织上来理解党的干部问题，更不要仅仅从干部问题上来理解干部问题。”（刘少奇：“论党”）地方主义者完全不懂得这些。在他们看来，实行“干部地方化”，是因为本地干部有些什么“特别”的地方，而“政治上的理由”和“客观形势发展的需要”等等都被完全抛弃了。很显然，他们违背了中央的指示。
    在地方主义者实行抗拒中央的组织路线的时候，他们还借口说：“外来干部不了解情况”。当然，由于语言隔阂，生活习惯不同，外来干部对地方的情况，是没有地方干部那样容易熟悉。但这并不是什么绝对的和不可克服的困难，只要假以时日和给予帮助，外来干部也是可以学会当地的语言和习惯于当地的群众生活的。况且，怎样才能真正了解情况，还有一个更重要的问题，即是以什么样的立场、观点和方法去了解情况的问题。那怕你是本地人，并且在农村中住上一辈子也好，如果是站在地主阶级或其他一切剥削者的立场，那你永远也不会了解农民的生活和要求，以及农村中的真实情况；反之，一个有正确阶级立场而又富有农村工作经验的人，尽管他是外地人，他一样会体察到农民和整个农村的真实情况。可见，所谓“不了解情况”决不是外来干部所特有的问题，本地干部一样也会“不了解情况”。外来干部的这种困难和外来干部本地干部之间的这种区别，根本不应当过分强调；以此来作为抗拒中央路线的理由，当然更是毫无根据。
    地方主义者常常宣称：干部要“清一色”的“本地人”，因为只有他们才能“联系当地的群众”。不可否认，本地干部和当地的群众，是有一些便于联系的条件的。当他们忠实执行中央的路线政策，站在正确的阶级立场上的时候，他们是群众利益的代表者，是和群众有密切联系的。但是当他们抗拒中央的路线政策，离开了正确的阶级立场的时候，他们就不是群众利益的代表者，而成为脱离群众、脱离实际的人物了。因为只有党的利益、党的路线政策是代表群众的利益的，离开了党的路线政策，离开了党的领导，同时就离开了群众。这无论是哪样的干部都无所例外。事实上，所有自负不凡、居功骄傲的地方主义者，无例外地都是高高在上的最脱离群众的人物。他们所记得的“群众”，往往只是他们的所谓“老部下”“老乡亲”，甚至是一些落伍了、蜕变了的“老熟人”。而真正经过革命运动斗争锻炼的广大工农群众，真正的人民群众则是与他们无缘的；群众对他们总是抱着“敬而远之”的态度。由此可知，地方主义者虽然也是本地人，但他们和本地群众却并没有什么真正的联系。
    地方主义者常常借口“不要割断历史”和“要照顾历史”，把地方的革命工作独立于全党的工作范围以外，把当地的革命历史从党的整个革命事业中割裂出来，然后要求别人不要割断他们的“历史”并照顾他们的“历史”。这种把党的历史和事业作为个人的或部分人的历史和事业的说法，显然是十分错误的。从这样的错误提法出发，自然就要认定，地方上的某一些人的职位，某一个军队的建制，某一个地区的权利，都是神圣不可侵犯的，而只容许他们自己世代相传地保持和承继下去了。可见，这个口号只是他们向党要名誉、要地位的一种借口，一种代名词。事情是很明白的，党的革命事业、革命历史是绝不能为任何人所分割的。无论哪一个地区的革命工作，哪一个地区的革命历史，都是在党的革命路线的领导下，在党的革命力量的支持下创造和建立起来的。即使是像远离中央的海南岛，如果没有党中央的领导和支援，莫说“红旗二十三年没有倒”，就算二十三个月不倒也很难做到。把一个地区的革命历史从党的整个历史中割裂出来而要求自成系统，是十分狂妄的。其次，历史不能够也不应当割断，这是客观的要求。但是历史里边有正确的有益的好的东西，也有不正确的有害的坏的东西。对于前者，一定要加以继承，并发扬而光大之；但对于后者，为什么不应当从中吸取教训，把它“割断”，把它端正？这恰恰也是历史发展客观规律的要求，是继承和发展历史所不可缺少的一个方面，而决不是什么“割断历史”。如果说这个话指的是外来干部和本地干部的关系，这就更谎谬绝伦。例如，广东党组织（包括海南党组织）的历史，最初就是由外来干部和本地干部共同创造起来的。在广东最先流血牺牲的领导人如肖楚女、张太雷等同志，都不是广东人；在海南的情形也一样。我国革命由南而北，后来又由北而南，从这点上说，早就没有本地外来之分了。如果要谈历史，这样的一页历史倒是不要割断的。应该认识，党对每一个地区的革命历史，是有充分的正确的估计的，对每一个在革命历史上的人物的劳绩，也绝不会抹煞的。但是如果想无原则地夸大自己在某一个地区的成就，或把党和人民群众的成就作为自己的成就，贪党之功以为己有，并以此来与中央相抗衡，则是绝对不能容许的。
    党内的地方主义，有它的社会的、历史的和思想的根源。总的说来，它是极端个人主义同封建宗派主义相结合的产物。
    有些人，过去曾经独立地领导和坚持一个地区的斗争，有一定的历史功劳，又有一批老部下，并有一定的群众威信，于是骄傲起来，夸大自己的功劳，贪党之功以为己功，发展了个人英雄主义和封建割据思想，企图永远保持他心目中的个人的荣誉、地位和权力。因此，他只能当领导，而不让能坚持原则、更有经验和能力的人来领导他。广东的特别是海南的地方主义正是在这样的情况下产生的。
    但是，这样的企图同党的原则是不相容的。在全国统一后，在实行社会主义革命和大规模的有计划的经济建设的情况下，如果坚持这种个人野心，就必然要走上反党、反社会主义的道路。一旦走上这样一条道路，他们就在任何时候对待任何问题都不会考虑党的利益，也不会真正考虑地方的利益；他们考虑一切问题，都是从个人主义的立场出发，从个人的荣誉、地位、权力，从个人的政治野心出发。所以一切严重的地方主义者，他们有时虽然身居高位，备受党的爱护和尊重，他们却反而总是认为党和别人不信任他，不尊重他。他们个人的野心是永远也不能够满足的。事实上，党愈是信任他，重用他，他的个人野心就愈有扩张，愈是狂妄，而他的不满也就愈多，地方主义的反党气焰也就愈烈。
    一般地说，有资产阶级个人主义和封建主义思想（地域观念、裙带观念等）以及一切其他落后意识的人，很容易成为地方主义的俘虏；他们为了达到自己的某些个人的目的，就会自觉或不自觉地站到地方主义的旗帜下，为其摇旗呐喊，传播流言，扩张声势，甚至直接参加其宗派小集团活动，自己变成为地方主义者。
    最近一两年来，地方主义在许多地方有所滋长，这是同国内国际的政治形势分不开的。在国内，继生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命取得了决定性胜利，政治方面和思想方面的社会主义革命进入了高潮时期，阶级斗争在一定时期内表现得十分尖锐和激烈；这种形势不会不反映到党内来，党内地方主义的某些滋长正是国内阶级斗争激烈化在党内的反映。在国际上，则在共产主义运动内部出现了一股修正主义的逆流，这也不会不影响到我们的党。
    所有这些，都说明了地方主义的产生是有其深远的原因的。全面地分析地方主义产生的根源，可以使我们更深刻地认识它的实质和危害性，并帮助我们找到克服和肃清它的正确方法。
    党中央和毛泽东同志历次在关于党内思想问题的指示中，都指出必须克服一切宗派主义、山头主义、小团体主义以及地方主义，因为这些错误思想倾向都是不利于党的团结的。1954年2月，党的七届四中全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”中说：“当此我国实行社会主义改造的紧要历史关头，有极大的必要来唤起全党同志更加注意提高革命警惕性，更加增强党的团结”。决议指出了党内部分干部中特别是高级干部中的那种骄傲情绪，和夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国的倾向的危险性。决议要求：必须把任何地区、任何部门的党的组织及其工作看作是在中央统一领导下的整个党及其工作的不可分割的一部分，反对任何派别思想、小团体习气、地方主义、山头主义和本位主义，反对任何妨碍中央统一领导、损害中央的团结和威信的言论和行动。这个决议的重大的现实意义，在今天不仅丝毫没有减少，相反的，几年来党内的情况表明，我们今后仍必须尽一切努力，来贯彻执行这个决议。由于某些地区地方主义还相当严重地存在，党的八届三中全会又特别提到必须反对地方主义的问题。每个共产党员都应当坚决执行中央的指示，对地方主义应当有高度的义愤，坚决、彻底地加以肃清。
    为了彻底肃清地方主义及其影响，必须加强干部的共产主义的教育，加强党内的政治思想工作，不断地帮助干部坚定无产阶级的立场，确立共产主义的人生观，提高马克思列宁主义的思想水平，学会运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点和方法来观察和处理问题，从而克服一切资产阶级个人主义的立场和观点，拔掉地方主义的根子。前面说过，地方主义的产生有其深远的根源，但是其中最主要的，还是资产阶级个人主义思想的发展。归根到底，地方主义是极端个人主义的一种表现形式。因此，彻底克服资产阶级个人主义，对于清除地方主义有决定性的意义。
    为了彻底肃清地方主义及其影响，在地方主义者的活动还很嚣张，他们已经挑起党内的争论和混乱，他们的各种借口和论调还有相当市场，他们所伪造的许多“事实”还蒙蔽了一些人的耳目的情况下，最好的方法，就是系统地开展大辩论。地方主义者如果企图对地方的历史问题来个大翻案，大家就来个历史问题的大辩论。通过大鸣、大放、大争、大辩，摆事实，讲道理，来彻底弄清事实，揭露真相，辨明是非；同时，通过这样的大辩论，具体地进行共产主义和党的路线的教育，使大家都认识到地方主义是共产主义的大敌，也是党的路线的大敌，因而自觉地起来反对地方主义，克服和清除同地方主义相联系的各种个人主义、自由主义、本位主义、分散主义、骄傲自满、封建宗派观念和封建地域观念等等错误思想。需要指出，反对地方主义，党中央和毛主席早就提出了，各级党委也曾研究、讨论过，但有些人犯了地方主义错误被批判之后又犯，原因之一就是并没有在全体党员中展开大规模的、广泛而深入的讨论，使党的思想水平普遍提高，使落后的、盲目的地方主义情绪没有市场。通过大辩论去从思想上坚决反对地方主义，无疑是一个极为有效的办法。
    为了彻底肃清地方主义及其影响，必须加强关于党的统一和团结的教育。党的统一和团结，地方服从中央，部分服从整体，个人服从组织，这是党的建设的不可侵犯的指导原则和党内生活的准则，是建立一个民主集中制的、有严格纪律和统一意志的强有力的党所必需的条件。每个党员都应当牢固地确立一个明确的观念，即“党的团结的利益高于一切”，从而把维护和巩固党的团结作为指导自己一切言论行动的标准，即有利于党的团结的话就说，不利于党的团结的话就不说，有利于党的团结的事就做，不利于党的团结的事就不做。为了做到这一点，还必须一方面健全党内的民主生活，充分发扬党内民主，另方面提高党员的原则性和纪律性，严格遵守民主集中制；同时，必须坚决反对一切不服从中央、不尊重党的领导、夸大个人作用、个人超越组织、自由主义、小广播和非组织的串连活动等错误倾向和行为。对于一个党员，这些倾向和行为都是非法的、决不容许的。在这方面的稍许让步，都会给党带来严重的后果，使党陷于分裂、瓦解状态，丧失战斗力，损害党的事业。
    为了肃清地方主义及其影响，在加强党的团结中，加强本地干部同外来干部之间的亲密团结是重要的环节之一。在同一个地方共同为执行中央路线、实现共产主义而斗争中，在各自努力使自己向共产主义化的方向前进中，两者彼此必须互相尊重，互相帮助，互相学习。本地干部必须特别注意防止和清除一切地方主义的思想情绪和表现，外来干部则必须特别注意熟悉当地的情况，加强同本地干部和群众的联系，力求使自己逐渐地地方化。
    为了彻底肃清地方主义及其影响，必须在对待和处理党员的地方主义错误问题时采取正确的态度和原则。这种正确的态度和原则，就是七届四中全会决议所提出的：“区别不同的情形，采取不同的方针”。同时还要注意到，地方主义基本上是党内的问题，一般地不要把它同资产阶级右派混为一谈，而应当加以适当的区别。一般有地方主义情绪和思想的人，当他们一旦认识到错误的性质，提高了觉悟之后，必然会同地方主义划清界限，参加反地方主义的斗争。因此，对于这些同志，应当鼓励他们自觉自愿地进行思想检查，解除思想包袱，提高共产主义觉悟。对于少数有严重地方主义思想甚至有反党行动的人，如果他们真正认识错误，痛悔前非，深刻检讨，决心改正，也采用“思想检查从严，组织处理从宽”的原则。但是对个别地方主义思想十分严重，反党活动十分坚决，而没有真正悔悟的表现，或者继续对党要两面派手法的分子，就必须严格执行纪律。（至于那些在阶级敌人向党猖狂进攻的时候，和阶级敌人站在一起实行其里应外合的阴谋的地方主义分子，当然不是什么党内问题而又当别论了。）只有这样，才能保持党的原则和纪律的严肃性，维护党的团结。
    地方主义对党的事业具有严重的危害性。近年来在某些地区的某些党员中存在和发展起来的地方主义，已经给党带来了一定的损失。但是党决不能容许地方主义的继续发展和存在，党总是及时地揭露他们，同他们进行必要的和严肃的斗争。党中央的政治路线和组织路线的完全正确，全体党员的团结一致和对这些正确路线的坚决执行，是对地方主义的斗争一定能够取得胜利，并一定能够把它彻底肃清的根本保证。当前，在某些地区，反对地方主义已成为保卫和巩固党的团结，保卫和贯彻中央路线的重要一环。我们要用反对地方主义斗争的胜利，来有力地支持当前的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，推动工农业生产的大高潮和大跃进，保证第二个五年计划的顺利执行。
