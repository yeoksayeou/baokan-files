Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is vigorously launching a high tide of the anti-waste movement with the revolutionary spirit of "exerting efforts and striving for the upstream." An average of five to six thousand big-character posters are appearing every day. In the seven days after the mobilization on February 6th, more than 41,000 big-character posters have been put up in this ministry.

At the beginning of the anti-waste movement in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the leading cadres took the lead and personally ignited the flames of anti-waste. At the mobilization meeting on February 6th, Vice Minister Lü Dong exposed 62 major cases of waste at one time. Cadres reflected that these were 62 very powerful oral big-character posters. The ministry then held two mobilization meetings for directors of departments, directors of bureaus, and some section chiefs, calling on leading cadres at all levels to write big-character posters as members of the masses. The vast majority of directors, bureau chiefs, and institute directors of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have written big-character posters. One director wrote 20 posters, of which eight have been posted. The director of the equipment section of the Basic Construction Department wrote 40 big-character posters at one time, exposing waste in equipment. In the Rolling Mill Section of the Ferrous Metal Design Institute, 97 big-character posters were produced on the first day after mobilization, of which 61 were written by the section chief and engineers. The leading cadres exposed the facts of waste in the big-character posters, made self-criticism, and pointed out the direction of anti-waste to the masses. In this way, the masses quickly boosted their spirits, making the big-character posters come on extremely fiercely. The Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute posted more than 1,940 posters on the first day, almost twice as many as the first day of general rectification. The anti-waste commando team of the Electricity Section of this institute, with the Communist Youth League as its core, has posted 640 big-character posters by 27 members. Xia Guojun, the leader of the design group of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, has posted 86 big-character posters. However, there are still individual units in this ministry where the anti-waste momentum is not strong. This is because the leaders there usually practice bureaucracy and are not personally involved now, so the big-character posters appear sporadically. The rectification leading group of the ministry is determined to eliminate this bureaucratic work style, eliminate officialdom and stagnation through this anti-waste movement.

The atmosphere of finding typical examples, opposing conservatism, comparing advanced experiences, and acting as promoters is a prominent feature of the anti-waste movement in this ministry. The ministry found that the leading cadres of the Basic Construction Department personally took the lead in promoting the rapid development of the movement, so it immediately convened a meeting of the ministry's directors of departments and bureaus in the Basic Construction Department for on-site evaluation, and the director of this department introduced their experience. This on-site meeting was a vivid education for the cadres and played a great role in promoting the movement. With the revolutionary zeal boosted, the big-character posters were filled with an atmosphere of opposing conservatism, comparing advanced experiences, and catching up with the advanced. A big-character poster in the Finance Department titled "Four Famous Mountains" said: The amount of circulating funds and the speed of turnover of the four tungsten mines in Jiangxi are different. If they all learn from an advanced one, 3 million yuan can be saved in a year. A big-character poster in the Planning Department criticized some backward and wasteful phenomena in blast furnace and open hearth furnace production, pointing out that if all the blast furnaces in the country learn from Anshan No. 6 Furnace, Benxi No. 2 Furnace, Ma'anshan No. 5 Furnace, and Daye's blast furnaces, 400,000 tons of pig iron can be produced in a year, and if all the open hearth furnaces in the country learn from Anshan Iron and Steel Company No.1 Steel Plant No.1 Open Hearth Furnace, 1 million tons of steel can be produced in a year.

In the struggle against waste, this ministry has firmly grasped the important link of political and ideological education and raised some economic waste phenomena to the level of political ideology. Many big-character posters have exposed the officialdom, extravagance, and stagnation of the leaders of some departments through the waste phenomena. For example, the ministry's cadres' children's primary school spent 1,400 yuan to make a wind-powered swivel chair. A factory in Shanghai issued 150 raincoats to 15 people in three years. An engineer at the Iron and Steel Research Institute took more than 10,000 yuan in wages in five years, but did not write a single report. This serious waste and serious stagnation on the part of cadres has not been questioned for a long time. A big-character poster revealed that the design of the green area of ​​the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was extremely large, and the area of ​​flower beds, lawns, and tree planting reached 54 hectares, which is equivalent to two and a half Zhongshan Parks in Beijing. This is amazing extravagance, and the leaders of the ministry have now decided to redesign it. The leaders of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have decided to overthrow all officialdom, extravagance, and stagnation through the struggle against waste, and to overthrow all dogmatism and unrealistic malpractices in design.

    领导干部一马当先燃起烈火
    冶金部通过反浪费打掉坏作风
    据新华社15日讯　冶金工业部正以“鼓起干劲、力争上游”的革命精神，猛烈地掀起反浪费运动的高潮。反浪费的大字报平均每天要出现五、六千张。在本月6日动员后的七天中，这个部已贴出大字报四万一千多张。
    冶金工业部反浪费运动一开始，领导干部就一马当先，亲自带头，燃起了反浪费的火焰。副部长吕东在6日的动员大会上，一次揭发了六十二个重大的浪费事实，干部反映：这是六十二张很有力的口头大字报。部里接着召开了两次司局长、处长和部分科长的动员会议，号召各级领导干部以群众中的一员的身份来写大字报。冶金部绝大多数的司长、局长、院长都写了大字报，有一个司长写了二十张，已贴出八张。基本建设司的设备处处长一次就写了四十张大字报揭发设备方面的浪费现象。黑色金属设计院轧钢科，在动员后第一天出了九十七张大字报，其中有六十一张都是科长和工程师写的。领导干部在大字报上一面揭发浪费事实，一面进行自我检讨，一面又给群众指出反浪费的方向。这样，群众很快就鼓起了劲头，使大字报来势极为猛烈。黑色冶金设计院第一天贴出一千九百四十多张，比一般整改时第一天贴出的大字报几乎增加了一倍。这个院的电力科以共青团为核心组成的反浪费突击队，二十七名队员已经贴了六百四十张大字报。有色冶金设计院设计组组长夏国钧已经贴出大字报八十六张。但是这个部里也还有个别单位的反浪费劲头不大，这是因为那里的领导上平日有官僚主义，现在又不亲自出马，大字报出现得零零落落。部里的整风领导小组决心要通过这次反浪费运动，打掉这种官僚主义作风，打掉官风和暮气。
    找典型、反保守、比先进、当促进派的风气，是这个部里反浪费运动的一个突出的特色。部里发现基本建设司领导干部亲自带头推动了运动迅速发展，就立即在基本建设司召集了部里的司局长会议，进行现场评比，并由这个司的司长介绍了他们的经验。这个现场会议对干部是一个生动的教育，起了极大的促进作用。革命的干劲鼓起来了，大字报上就充满了反保守、比先进、赶先进的气氛。财务司的一张题为“四大名山”的大字报上说：江西四个钨矿山，流通资金多少不一，周转快慢不一，如果都向一个先进的看齐，一年就可以节省三百万元。计划司的一张大字报批评了高炉平炉生产上的某些落后和浪费现象，指出全国的高炉都向鞍山六号炉、本溪二号炉、马鞍山五号炉和大冶的高炉看齐，一年就可以增产四十万吨生铁，全国的平炉都向鞍山第一炼钢厂第一号平炉看齐，一年就可以增产一百万吨钢。
    这个部在反浪费斗争中，紧紧抓住政治思想教育这一重要环节，把经济上的某些浪费现象，提高到政治思想上来认识。许多大字报通过浪费现象，揭发了某些部门领导上的官气、阔气和暮气等。如部里的干部子弟小学，用一千四百元做了一个风车转椅。上海一个厂在三年内曾为十五个人发了一百五十件雨衣。钢铁研究所的一个工程师，五年内拿了一万多元的工资，却一个报告都没写出来。这种干部上的严重浪费，严重暮气，长期以来无人过问。一张大字报揭露太原钢厂绿化面积的设计极为庞大，花坛、草圃、植树的面积竟达五十四公顷，相当于两个半北京的中山公园。这是惊人的阔气，部的领导上现在已决定重新设计。冶金部的领导上决定通过反浪费的斗争，打倒一切官气、阔气、暮气，打倒设计方面的一切教条主义、脱离实际的歪风。
