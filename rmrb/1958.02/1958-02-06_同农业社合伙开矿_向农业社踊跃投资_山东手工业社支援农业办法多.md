　　Jinan, February 5th (by our own reporter) – Handicraft cooperatives in Shandong Province are actively integrating with the agricultural economy, implementing the policy of serving agricultural production, and have achieved remarkable results in supporting agricultural production.

　　Shandong handicraft cooperatives are combining with agriculture in a variety of ways. The general principle is to both adapt to the habits of the masses and implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. The first method is to jointly mine various scattered small mineral deposits. The Zhaoyuan County Handicraft Gold Mining Cooperative and agricultural cooperatives jointly mine gold. The handicraft cooperative is responsible for providing funds and technical guidance, and the agricultural cooperative is responsible for providing labor. The income is divided between the two parties according to agreed proportions. Last year, the handicraft cooperative here, with 95 members as the backbone, guided more than 500 agricultural cooperative members to produce 700 taels of gold. The Zibo City Handicraft Smelting Cooperative and the Boshan County Agricultural Cooperative jointly mined lead ore. Last winter, they smelted more than 1,000 catties of lead. Members of the agricultural cooperative can earn more than one yuan a day.

　　The second method is for urban handicraft cooperatives to go to the countryside and mountains to serve the production and living needs of agricultural cooperative members. After the upsurge of water conservancy construction and soil improvement in rural areas last winter and this spring, handicraft repair cooperatives in Zibo, Shouguang and other places promptly sent people to the construction sites to repair tools for farmers.

　　The third method is to generally revise the 1958 production plan according to the needs of agricultural production, and vigorously increase the production of agricultural tools, fertilizers, transportation tools and various parts needed for local agricultural production. The planned output value of the Changwei Special District Ironware Cooperative this year is 59% higher than in 1957. The Qingdao Chemical Cooperative plans to produce 3,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer this year, five times more than last year.

　　The fourth method is that many handicraft cooperative members who live in rural areas voluntarily take out part of their wages and invest in agricultural cooperatives to help them solve financial difficulties. Last winter, more than 5,000 members of several handicraft cotton weaving cooperatives in Weixian invested 190,000 yuan in agricultural cooperatives in two months, solving the urgent need of agricultural cooperatives for fertilizers and agricultural tools. The handicraft cooperative members also timely met their needs for grain, achieving satisfaction on both sides. This year, these handicraft cooperative members plan to invest more than 3 million yuan in agricultural cooperatives.

　　This year, the Preparatory Committee of the Shandong Provincial Handicraft Federation decided to universally promote the adoption of various measures suitable to local conditions to closely integrate with agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, in order to expand handicraft production and support the great development of agriculture. Handicraft cooperatives in more than ten cities and counties plan to organize agricultural cooperatives to mine ore and build small iron smelting furnaces with a combined annual output of 50,000 tons of pig iron. It is estimated that 20,000 tons of iron can be smelted this year, and agricultural cooperatives can thereby increase their income by 3 million yuan.

　　同农业社合伙开矿　向农业社踊跃投资
    山东手工业社支援农业办法多
    本报济南5日电　山东省手工业社积极同农业经济相结合，贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，支援农业生产，取得了显著的成就。
    山东手工业社同农业相结合的办法是多种多样的。总的原则是既适应群众习惯，又贯彻自愿两利的政策。第一种办法是合伙开采各种分散的小矿藏。招远县手工业采金社和农业社合伙采金，由手工业社负责提供资金和技术指导，农业社负责提供劳动力，收益由双方按成分劈。去年这里的手工业社以九十五名社员为骨干，指导五百多名农业社员生产黄金七百两。淄博市手工业熔炼社同博山县农业社共同开采铅矿石，去冬已经炼铅一千多斤，农业社的社员每天可以获得一元多的收入。
    第二种办法是城镇手工业社下乡上山，为农业社社员的生产和生活需要服务。去冬今春农村掀起兴修水利和改良土壤的运动以后，淄博、寿光等地的手工业修配社都及时派人赶到工地为农民修理工具。
    第三种办法是根据农业生产的需要，普遍修订了1958年的生产计划，大力增产当地农业生产需要的农具、肥料、运输工具和各种零件。昌潍专区铁业社今年的产值计划，平均比1957年提高59％。青岛市化工社今年计划生产氮肥三千吨，比去年增加了五倍。
    第四种办法是许多家住农村的手工业社社员，自愿地拿出一部分工资，向农业社投资，帮助农业社解决资金困难。去冬，潍县几处手工业棉织社的五千多名社员，在两个月的时间内就向农业社投资十九万元，解决了农业社对肥料、农具的急需，手工业社员也及时满足了对粮食的需要，做到双方满意。今年这些手工业社的社员，计划再向农业社投资三百多万元。
    今年山东省手工业联合社筹委会决定在全省范围内，普遍提倡因地制宜地采取各种办法同农业社紧密结合，以扩大手工业生产，支援农业大发展。十多个市、县的手工业社计划组织农业社开采矿石，建设共可年产五万吨生铁的小炼铁炉；今年预计可以炼铁二万吨，农业社可以因此增加收入三百万元。
