I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Vice Chairman Peng, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now, regarding the issue of "decentrally building small cement plants to produce large quantities of low-grade cement" mentioned in Vice Premier Bo's report, I offer the following opinions for reference.

In the past few years, the development of China's cement industry has been rapid. During the First Five-Year Plan, cement production increased by 1.4 times, completing the planned targets ahead of schedule and exceeding them, supporting national economic construction. We believe it is possible to reach or exceed the level of the United Kingdom within fifteen years. However, due to the leap-forward development of industrial construction and other aspects of basic construction, cement production still cannot fully meet the needs, and there have been repeated instances of local or temporary tensions between supply and demand. During the First Five-Year Plan, the supply of cement mainly focused on meeting the needs of industrial construction. In agriculture, except for some large-scale water conservancy projects, it was difficult to supply cement for the vast rural areas to build small and medium-sized water conservancy projects.

**Rural Demand for Cement Continues to Expand – Establishing Small Plants in Various Locations is Very Necessary**

The guiding principle of China's Second Five-Year Plan is to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously, based on the priority development of heavy industry. Agriculture will develop even more during the Second Five-Year Plan than during the First Five-Year Plan. The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposed by the Party Central Committee is not only a program of action for farmers across the country but also defines a glorious task for our building materials industry sector. Since the great debate on the socialist road in rural areas last year, a high tide of agricultural production has been formed. Across the country, a vigorous movement has been universally launched to open canals, build dikes, and construct small and medium-sized reservoirs, and the demand for cement is constantly expanding. It is important to note here that not all cementitious materials called cement refer to high-grade cement. In a broad sense, all hydraulically setting cementitious materials are called cement. How to meet the needs of the vast rural areas for cement in large-scale water conservancy construction is a major issue at present. The Ministry of Building Materials Industry has conducted some research on this. We believe that in addition to existing production plants further tapping their potential to strive for increased production and accelerating the construction of large and medium-sized new plants according to plan, to adapt to the new situation, based on the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, we must also take into account the overall situation, adapt to local conditions, and fully utilize the economic potential (human, material, and financial resources) of the local areas to establish some small and workshop-style cement plants accordingly. From points to the surface, widely distributed in various provinces, cities, special districts, counties, and even some townships or villages, to meet the needs of rural water conservancy construction and corresponding construction projects for cement.

**Building Small Plants in Counties or Townships Simply and Locally – Spending Little Money and Meeting Rural Needs**

Building large and medium-sized cement plants in key areas of industrial construction is entirely necessary, but large plants require a large amount of raw materials and heavy equipment. Resource exploration and plant design generally take about four years, and the investment is also large (annual output of one ton requires an investment of about 100 yuan). Therefore, it is impossible to achieve rapid and comprehensive development and widespread distribution in various regions. Moreover, the rural areas are vast and the transportation is inconvenient, which not only increases transportation costs (a typical survey in Hebei Province showed that the freight cost is about 100 yuan per ton, while the ex-factory price is only 50 yuan), but also causes unnecessary losses if the transportation is not properly managed. The advantages of large factories are modern equipment, so the output is large, the quality is high, and the cost is low. To supply the construction of key industrial areas, to catch up with the industrial level of the United Kingdom within fifteen years, and for the long-term plan of socialist construction, the construction of large cement plants is entirely necessary. However, China has a vast territory, and agriculture will develop even more during the Second Five-Year Plan than during the First Five-Year Plan. In order to support the urgent need for rapid development of agricultural water conservancy, while focusing on the construction of large and medium-sized cement plants, we should also build some small cement plants that use vertical kilns in provinces or special districts, and build some small plants or handicraft workshops that produce low-grade cement such as lime-burning clay more generally in counties or townships. This can supplement the shortage of supply and the difficulties encountered due to poor transportation conditions, so that the vast rural areas can conveniently obtain the necessary hydraulic cementitious materials.

In order to adapt to the economic conditions of rural areas, starting from handicraft workshops in a simple way is to make it easy and to lay a production foundation for gradual expansion and development as needed. The production development process can start from the simplest use of manpower or animal power, and further use electricity with the development of electricity, and gradually become mechanized step by step.

In the vast rural areas, in addition to water conservancy projects, there are many different types of construction projects with the development of agricultural production. In general construction projects, high-grade cement is not necessary. At present, most cement plants in China produce 400-500 grade cement, and it is economically unreasonable to use this high-grade cement in many cases. In rural construction, cement mortar and low-grade concrete are used the most. In this case, low-grade cement of 300 grade and below can fully meet the requirements.

Based on the above situation, it is suggested that it is necessary to build some small cement plants that produce low-grade cement in provinces, special districts, counties, and even townships, combined with local needs and raw materials and transportation conditions. The design principles of these factories should be:

**Factory Design Principles:**

1.  **Take materials locally, manufacture locally, and supply locally.**

The main raw materials for manufacturing cement are lime-based and clay-based substances. These raw materials can be found almost everywhere. For example, to manufacture low-grade cement, there are conditions for manufacturing lime-burning clay cement wherever lime can be produced. Where there are iron and steel plants, the by-product slag from ironmaking can be used as raw material to produce lime slag cement or gypsum slag cement. In addition to natural raw materials such as volcanic ash, tuff, etc., many things can be used. Many industrial waste residues or by-products can also be used. For example, broken bricks and tiles from brick and tile factories, and electric plant furnace ash (coal cinder) of appropriate quality can be ground with lime to make low-grade cement. These cements are suitable for preparing mortar for general engineering use. Taking materials locally can rationally utilize resources to develop local industries, and can combine production and sales to avoid transportation turnover and prevent economic losses or waste caused by unsalable or stockpiled products.
2.  **The quantity and quality should meet the requirements of local engineering use.**

The purpose of production is to meet the needs of local construction. Therefore, when carrying out production planning, it is necessary to combine it with the local industrial and agricultural development, and try to meet the requirements of quantity and the requirements of engineering quality, so as to use cement economically and reasonably, and to ensure the quality of the project and avoid waste.
3.  **The process and equipment conditions should be simple and adapt to local conditions to save investment.**

The process should be arranged according to the specific conditions of the raw materials, and the equipment should be considered according to the process, but it should be based on one principle, that is, planning should be carried out in combination with local conditions and specific circumstances. For example, power is needed in production. This needs to be considered depending on the situation. It is not necessarily necessary to use electricity. If there is water power that can be used to manufacture low-grade cement, water power can be used. In places with poor conditions, animal power or manpower can be used in a simple way. For example, where lime is produced, there are conditions for producing lime-burning clay cement. For another example, where bricks and tiles are produced, brick and tile scraps or brick and tile kiln equipment can be used to burn clay to make lime-burning clay cement. In short, try to use existing and usable various conditions or equipment to save investment. Frugality in doing everything cannot be ignored at any time.
4.  **Try to adopt standard designs and equipment for promotion and shortening the construction period.**

Building a factory according to the procedure is to first conduct resource exploration, select a site, design according to the production process, select and order equipment according to the process conditions, and finally install and produce. This series of tasks takes a long time to complete. It is time-consuming and labor-intensive to have a set for each factory. This is absolutely necessary for the construction of large and medium-sized plants, but it is not compatible with the new situation of leap-forward development. For this reason, our ministry's design institute will select improved vertical kilns and production processes of Shandong Cement Plant, Yunnan Cement Plant, and other types to make a standard design. In the future, local areas can make slight changes to the design according to local conditions, and then carry out factory construction. The use of certain standard equipment can shorten the time for ordering equipment and speed up the equipment installation process to create conditions for early production and supply. At the same time, this greatly reduces some basic difficulties that exist in places where technical forces are weak.

Based on the above principles, we believe that it is in line with the spirit of the Central Committee's more, faster, better, and more economical, and is an effective way to develop local cement industry and support agricultural construction.

**How Big Should a Cement Plant Be? How to Organize Production?**

What should be the scale of a small low-grade cement plant? Based on existing data and experience, the following opinions are put forward:

**I. Small low-grade cement plants can be divided into two types:**

1.  **Use improved indigenous vertical kilns to produce ordinary cement, slag cement, or pozzolanic cement.**

The production scale is an annual output of 10,000 to 30,000 tons. The product standard is 200-400 grade. The production equipment is mainly vertical kilns, with simple ventilation equipment, producing cement clinker. (Mechanized vertical kilns are not considered here.) Ball mills, air-swept mills, or Raymond mills are used to grind raw materials and cement. The power requirement is about 70 kWh per ton of clinker. The investment is about 600,000 to 1.8 million yuan, and the construction period is about one year. The product type can produce ordinary cement, slag cement, or pozzolanic cement according to the raw material situation. The cost of the product is roughly the same as the cost of cement produced by vertical kilns in Shandong or Yunnan and other factories. The scope of use is the production of concrete and reinforced concrete. Product sales are entirely supplied locally and are not included in the national allocation plan. This type of factory can be set up by the province or special district.
2.  **Use simple equipment to produce lime-burning clay cement or other pozzolanic cement.**

The production scale is an annual output of 300 to 1,000 tons. The product standard is 25-150 grade. Lime and burnt clay are the main raw materials (slag or other pozzolanic raw materials can be used according to local conditions). This product is mainly used as masonry mortar or facing. The product cost is not much different from lime. Where there is electricity, electricity can be used. Depending on the production scale, the electricity requirement is about 20 to 30 kW. In places where there is no electricity, animal power or manpower can be used. The investment ranges from several thousand yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. The construction period is four to six months. Depending on the local situation, it can be set up by the county or township.

**II. In terms of organizing production, the following steps and methods can be used:**

(1) First conduct pilot projects in places where the transportation lines are too long and there is an urgent need for low-grade cement, and gradually promote them after gaining experience (including production technology and usage methods).

(2) Small-scale handicraft workshop production of lime-burning clay cement can be used as a rural sideline, and production can be carried out during slack farming seasons. Produce more when needed, and temporarily reduce or stop production when less is needed. Therefore, it is advisable to start in a simple way, and not to spread the stall too large at once and spend a lot of money.

(3) Combine it with lime or brick and tile production, so you only need to add some crushing equipment, and sales operations can also be combined. Existing large and medium-sized cement plants and relevant central departments should be responsible for technical guidance.

The above are just preliminary opinions and are not mature enough. The Ministry of Building Materials is organizing design institutes and research institutes to continue to conduct specialized research and work together to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

### 建设小型水泥厂　支援农村修水利  王涛代表提出建小厂的规模和如何组织生产的意见

　　建设小型水泥厂　支援农村修水利
    王涛代表提出建小厂的规模和如何组织生产的意见
    我完全同意李副总理薄副总理彭副委员长及吴玉章主任的报告。现就薄副总理报告中有关“分散地建设小型水泥厂，大量生产低标号水泥”的问题，提出意见供参考。
    几年来我国水泥工业的发展是迅速的，在第一个五年计划中水泥的产量增加了一点四倍，提前和超额完成了计划指标，支援了国家经济建设。我们认为有可能在十五年以内提前达到或超过英国的水平。虽然如此，但由于工业建设及其他方面的基本建设跃进地发展，水泥的生产仍不能全部满足需要，曾一再出现过局部的或暂时的供求不相适应的紧张情况。在第一个五年计划期间水泥的供应主要是大力满足工业建设，在农业方面除一些大型水利工程外，广大的农村兴修中小型水利工程很难供应到水泥。
    农村对水泥要求不断扩大  各地创建小型厂非常必要
    我国第二个五年计划的方针是在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业与发展农业同时并举，而农业在第二个五年计划中将比第一个五年计划有更大发展。党中央提出的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）不仅是全国农民的行动纲领，也是给我们建筑材料工业部门规定了光荣的任务。自去年农村经过走社会主义道路大辩论以后，农业生产的高潮即已形成，全国各地热火朝天地普遍开展了开渠筑堰兴修中小型水库的运动，对于水泥的要求正不断地扩大。在这里需要说明的，凡称为水泥的胶凝材料不一定是指高标号水泥，从广义说，凡具有水硬性的胶凝材料都叫水泥。如何满足广大农村在大兴水利中对水泥的需要是当前一个重大的问题。建筑材料工业部曾对此作了些研究，我们认为除了现有生产厂进一步挖掘潜力努力增产，并按计划加速大中型新建厂建设外，为适应新的形势，本多、快、好、省的精神，还必须统筹兼顾、因地制宜、充分发挥地方的经济潜力（人力、物力、财力）相应创建一些小型的和作坊式的水泥厂。从点到面，广布全国各省、市、专区、县甚至某些乡或村，以满足农村兴修水利及相应的各项建设对水泥的需要。
    在县或乡因陋就简建小型厂  花钱不多又能满足农村需要
    在工业建设重点地区建设大中型水泥厂是完全必要的，但由于大厂需要大量的原料和重型的设备。资源勘查和设计建厂，一般需要四年左右，同时投资亦大（每年吨产量约需投资一百元），因此，不可能做到迅速地全面的发展，普遍地分布到各地区。而且农村地广面大，交通运输不便，不仅运输费用增加（河北省典型调查每吨加上运费约为一百元，而出厂价格只有五十元），如运输途中保管不善还会遭到不必要的损失。大厂优越性是有现代化设备，因此产量大质量高成本低。为供应重点工业地区的建设，为在十五年内赶上英国的工业水平，为社会主义建设的长远打算，大型水泥厂的兴建是完全必要的。而我国幅员广阔，并且农业在第二个五年计划中将比第一个五年计划有更大的发展，为支援农业水利迅速发展的急切需要，在重点兴建大中型水泥厂的同时，还应该在省或专区建设一些小型的用立窑生产的水泥厂，和因陋就简地在县或乡较为普遍地办一些生产石灰烧粘土之类的低标号水泥的小厂或手工业式的作坊，这样就可以补充供应量的不足和因交通条件不好而碰到的困难，使广大农村能便利地得到必须的水硬性胶凝材料。
    为适应农村的经济情况，因陋就简地从手工业作坊式着手是为了轻而易举，为了随着需要而逐步扩大和发展打下生产基础。生产发展过程又可以从最简单的采用人力或畜力开始，随电力的发展进一步采用电力而一步一步地变为机械化。
    在广大的农村中除水利工程外，随着农业生产的发展，相应的有很多不同类型的建筑工程，而在一般的工程项目中是不必要高标号水泥的。现国内大部分水泥厂都生产400—500号水泥，在许多的情况下使用这种高标号水泥在经济上是不合理的。在农村建设中水泥砂浆及低标号混凝土用得最多。在这种情况下300号及以下的低标号水泥完全能够满足要求。
    根据以上情况，建议在省、专区、县甚至乡结合当地需要和原料、交通情况，建设一些生产低标号水泥的小型水泥厂是必要的。这些工厂的建厂设计原则应该是：
    建厂设计原则：
    1．就地取材、就地制造、就地供应。
    制造水泥的主要原料主要是石灰质和粘土质的物质，这些原料几乎是随处都能找到的，如制造低标号水泥，只要能生产石灰的地方就有条件制造石灰烧粘土水泥。有炼铁厂的地方就可以利用炼铁副产品矿渣作原料生产石灰矿渣水泥或石膏矿渣水泥。除天然原料如火山灰、凝灰岩……等很多东西可资利用外，有许多工业废渣或副产品同样可以利用，如砖瓦厂的砖瓦碎块，适当质量的电厂炉灰（煤渣）均可与石灰磨制成低标号水泥。这些水泥都适用于调制砂浆供一般工程使用。就地取材就能合理利用资源发展地方工业，并能产销结合即可避免运输周转，防止脱销或积压所造成的经济上的损失或浪费。
    2．数量质量应以满足当地工程使用的要求。
    生产的目的是为了满足当地建设的需要，因此进行生产规划时要与当地的工农业发展结合起来，尽量满足数量的要求和工程质量的要求条件，以达到既经济又合理的来使用水泥，既要保证工程质量又要避免浪费。
    3．工艺过程设备条件应因陋就简，适应当地情况，节约投资。
    工艺过程应该根据原料的具体条件来安排，而设备又应按工艺过程来考虑，但应该本着一个原则，就是要结合当地条件和具体情况来进行规划，比如在生产中需要动力，这就需要看情况，不是一律非用电力不可，如制造低标号水泥，有水力可以利用的地方就可以利用水力，条件差的地方可以因陋就简利用畜力或人力。又如生产石灰的地方就有条件生产石灰烧粘土水泥。再如生产砖瓦的地方就可以利用砖瓦碎片或砖瓦窑设备来烧粘土作石灰烧粘土水泥。总之，尽量利用已有的，可以利用的各种条件或设备以节约投资。用穷办法勤俭办一切事业是任何时候不能忽视的。
    4．尽量采用标准设计和设备，以便推广，缩短建厂时间。
    办一个工厂按程序是先进行资源勘查，厂址选择，按生产流程进行设计，根据工艺条件选订设备，最后才能安装以至生产，这一系列的工作需要很长时间才能完成，这样每个厂来一套就费时费事，这在进行大中型厂建设时是绝对必需的，但与当前跃进发展的新形势是不相适应的。为此，我部设计院将选择山东水泥厂、云南水泥厂等类型的改良立窑和生产流程作出一种标准设计，各地方将来就可以根据地区情况把设计稍加变动，就可进行建厂。并利用某些标准设备就可以缩短订制设备时间，加速设备安装的过程为提前生产供应创造条件。同时，这样大大地减少地方在技术力量薄弱所存在的一些基本上的困难。
    根据以上提出的原则，我们认为是符合中央多、快、好、省的精神，是发展地方水泥工业，支援农业建设的有效途径。
    建设多大的水泥厂？怎样组织生产？
    关于小型的低标号的水泥厂，究竟应该是怎样一个规模呢？根据现有资料和经验提出以下意见：
    一、小型的低标号的水泥厂可分为两种类型：
    1、用改良土法立窑生产普通水泥、矿渣水泥或火山灰质水泥；
    生产规模是年产量一至三万吨，产品标准为200—400号，生产设备主要为立窑，附有简单的通风设备，生产水泥熟料。（机械化的立窑不在此考虑）用球磨、风扫式磨或雷蒙磨来磨制生料和水泥。电力需用量按每吨熟料计算约为七十瓩时，投资约需六十至一百八十万元，建厂时间约需一年左右。产品种类根据原料情况，可生产普通水泥、矿渣水泥或火山灰水泥。产品的费用大致与山东或云南等厂立窑生产的水泥费用相仿。使用范围制混凝土及钢筋混凝土。产品销售完全供应当地使用，不列入国家分配计划。这种类型的厂可由省或专区来筹办。
    2、利用简单设备生产石灰烧粘土水泥或其它火山灰质水泥。
    生产规模为年产量三百至一千吨，产品标准为25—150号，以石灰及烧粘土为主要原料，（可根据地方情况采用矿渣或其他火山灰质原料）这种产品主要用作砌筑砂浆或抹面，产品成本与石灰相差不大。有电力的地方可用电力，根据生产规模不同，需用电力约二十至三十瓩。无电力的地方可用畜力或人力，投资从几千元至几万元，建厂时间四至六个月，根据地方情况可由县或乡来办。
    二、在组织生产方面可按下列步骤和方法来进行：
    （1）先在运输线过长而又急切需要低标号水泥的地方作为试点，取得经验后逐步推广（包括生产技术及使用方法）。
    （2）手工业作坊式的小规模生产石灰烧粘土水泥作为农村副业，并可利用农闲时间进行生产，需用多时就多生产，需用少时就暂时减产或停产。因此开始时宜因陋就简，不可一下就把摊子摆得很大，花费很多的钱。
    （3）与石灰或砖瓦生产结合起来，这样就只需添一些粉碎设备即可，在销售业务上也可结合起来。现有的大中型水泥厂及中央有关部门应负技术指导的责任。
    以上仅是初步意见，还不够成熟，建材部正在组织设计院和研究院，继续进行专门研究，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而共同努力。
