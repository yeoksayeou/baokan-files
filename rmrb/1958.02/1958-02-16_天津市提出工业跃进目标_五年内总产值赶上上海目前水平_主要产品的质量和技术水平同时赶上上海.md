Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 15th: Tianjin has set the goal of striving to reach Shanghai's current level of total industrial output value within five years, while also catching up with Shanghai in the quality and technical level of its major products. This was the fighting goal for the Second Five-Year Plan proposed to all workers by Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Tianjin, at the Tianjin Municipal Labor Model Conference held on the 13th.

Huang Huoqing told the labor models that Shanghai is the largest city in China, and its total industrial output value in 1957 reached 12.8 billion yuan (calculated at 1952 constant prices), with a high level of technology and product quality. Is it possible to catch up with Shanghai? Let's calculate: Tianjin's total industrial output value increased from just over 1.7 billion yuan in 1952 to over 4.1 billion yuan in 1957, more than doubling in five years, with an average annual growth rate of over 19%. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the development speed of Tianjin's industry was affected by some unfavorable factors, such as some factories lacking raw materials and tasks in 1954 and 1955, resulting in shutdowns or semi-shutdowns. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the state will fully utilize and rationally develop coastal industrial cities, and national industrial and agricultural production is making great leaps forward. After Tianjin is placed under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province, it will be able to receive closer support from the vast rural areas of Hebei. Therefore, the speed of Tianjin's industrial development in the future will definitely be much faster than during the First Five-Year Plan period. From the current situation of discussing plans, the city's total industrial output value this year can be increased by at least 40% compared to last year, so the industrial output value in 1958 can reach 5.74 billion yuan. If we move forward at a rate of 20% annual increase for the next four years, we can reach 11.9 billion yuan by 1962. With hard work, it is not impossible to reach Shanghai's current level. Everyone must go all out to strive for the realization of this goal.

After explaining the extremely favorable domestic political and economic conditions to the labor models, Huang Huoqing pointed out that the current problem is how we strive subjectively, whether we have revolutionary vigor, and whether we are willing to be promoters or obstructors. Huang Huoqing asked the labor models to make persistent efforts, for the advanced to become even more advanced, and to lead the city's workers to move forward bravely and quickly.

Encouraged by this fighting goal, the labor models were invigorated and expressed their determination to muster the greatest revolutionary vigor, lead the city's workers to actively learn technology, improve technology, and carry out socialist competitions in depth to achieve this fighting goal.

    天津市提出工业跃进目标
    五年内总产值赶上上海目前水平
    主要产品的质量和技术水平同时赶上上海
    据新华社天津15日电　全市工业总产值五年内争取达到目前上海的水平，主要产品的质量和技术水平也要赶上上海。这是中共天津市委第一书记、天津市市长黄火青在13日举行的天津市劳动模范大会上，向全市职工提出的第二个五年计划的奋斗目标。
    黄火青向劳动模范们说，上海是我国第一大城市，这个城市1957年的工业总产值达到了一百二十八亿元（按1952年不变价格计算），技术和产品质量有较高的水平。向上海看齐是不是作得到？我们来算一算：天津市工业总产值在1952年只有十七亿多元到1957年增加到四十一亿多元，五年内增加了一翻还要多，每年平均递增速度是19％多。在第一个五年计划期间，天津工业发展速度受到了一些不利因素的影响，如1954年和1955年有些工厂原料和任务不足，陷于停工或半停工状态。在第二个五年计划期间，国家将充分利用和合理发展沿海工业城市，全国的工农业生产都在大跃进，天津市划归河北省后又能够得到河北广大农村更密切的支援，因此天津市今后工业发展的速度一定可以比第一个五年计划期间快得多。从目前讨论计划情况来看，今年全市工业总产值起码可以比去年提高40％，这样1958年的工业产值就可以达到五十七亿四千万元。以后四年如果以每年递增20％的速度前进，到1962年就可以达到一百十九亿元。如果努力争取，达到现在上海的水平不是不可能的。大家要全力以赴来争取这个目标的实现。
    黄火青向劳动模范们讲解了国内政治上和经济上极为良好的条件以后指出，现在的问题就是看我们主观的努力如何，就是看我们有没有革命的干劲，就是看我们是愿意当促进派还是当促退派。黄火青要求劳动模范们要再接再厉，先进更加先进，带动全市职工快马加鞭勇猛向前。
    劳动模范们在这个奋斗目标鼓舞下，人心振奋，表示决心鼓起最大的革命干劲，带动全市职工积极学习技术，提高技术，深入开展社会主义竞赛，来实现这一奋斗目标。
