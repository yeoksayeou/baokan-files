Ushering in a Greenification Upsurge
    Huitong County Challenges Counties Across Hunan

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th - In order to further promote the afforestation and forest protection movement, and to usher in this year's greenification upsurge, Huitong County, Hunan Province, has issued a friendly challenge to all counties in the province. The Ministry of Forestry believes that this is a very meaningful action, and that it has a positive effect on promoting the current afforestation and forest protection movement and on improving the quality of afforestation. It hopes that all localities will refer to and promote this approach.

    Huitong County's friendly challenge proposes the following: to complete the planting of 70,000 mu of "Happiness Forests" in the spring, with a survival rate of over 95%; to continue to carry out forest protection and fire prevention activities in order to protect existing forests and ensure that no fire alarms occur within one year; and to mobilize the entire county to actively support the work of greening barren mountains, with the largest barren mountain in the county, Jinlong Mountain, to be completely greenified this year. The challenge also proposes specific measures to achieve the plan.

    A competition for afforestation will be launched between townships, between communes, and between teams throughout the county.
