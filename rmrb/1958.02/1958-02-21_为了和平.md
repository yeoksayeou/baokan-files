"The Chinese people ardently love peace. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for the entire human race in the whole world." This is the great will of the Chinese people expressed in the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties on November 4, 1950. At that time, in order to carry out the will of the Chinese people, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people formed the Chinese People's Volunteers, crossed the Yalu River, resisted America and aided Korea, protected their homes and defended the country. Together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, they resisted the fully modern-equipped American aggressors with inferior equipment, fought bloody battles for three years, stopped the aggression, and finally achieved the armistice in Korea, taking the first step towards a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers, responding to the Korean government's call for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and agreeing to the Chinese government's proposal, solemnly declare to the world: The Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to completely withdraw from Korea by the end of 1958, with the first batch to be withdrawn before April 30. The Chinese people feel immensely proud of this major decision. The glorious Chinese People's Volunteers once bravely shed blood on the Korean battlefield for peace, and now, for peace, they have resolutely decided to leave the beautiful land stained with their generously paid blood and sweat.

The Chinese People's Volunteers have been abroad for seven years, and have made immortal contributions to the motherland, to the people, to Asian peace, and to world peace.

Everyone remembers how rampant the United States was when it launched the war of aggression against Korea and simultaneously occupied our territory of Taiwan. Intoxicated by its temporary success, the American aggressors blatantly ignored the repeated warnings from the Chinese people. After crossing the 38th parallel, they burned the flames of war to the banks of the Yalu River, with the spearhead of aggression aimed directly at China. Moreover, the American air force invading Korea recklessly intruded into our Northeast airspace, bombing our cities and villages, killing our compatriots, and destroying our property. Our security was severely threatened, and the Chinese people could no longer tolerate it. In order to support our neighbor and protect our homes and defend the country, we sent our volunteers. Although the conditions at the time were extremely difficult, the Chinese People's Volunteers, disregarding the extremely difficult material conditions at the time, defeated the powerful and ferocious American army shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people with a spirit of great fearlessness. In three years of hard fighting, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies jointly annihilated 1.09 million enemy troops, including as many as 390,000 American troops; shot down, damaged, and seized more than 12,000 American aircraft and more than 3,000 tanks. The American invading army was defeated back to the 38th parallel, and the commander-in-chief of the American invading army, under the banner of the "United Nations," finally had to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The victorious battle of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression proved that when imperialism妄想to invade us and insists on imposing war on us, we are fully capable of defeating it. The victory or defeat of war is not determined by weapons, but by people. Victory will surely belong to the people who fight for justice and against aggression. The most ferocious local war launched by the American aggressors with all their strength after World War II suffered a shameful defeat. The American policy of strength went bankrupt, and the American paper tiger was exposed.

The great war of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression also shattered the US’s arrogant plan to occupy all of Korea and then invade our territory. In the severe days of the winter of 1950, the new China suffered its first and most serious test. However, facts have proven that the Chinese people who have mastered their own destiny are not to be insulted. The victory on the Korean battlefield defended our peaceful construction and the peaceful life of our people. The great movement to resist America and aid Korea swept away the thoughts of worshiping, fearing, and flattering the United States—the ideological toxins left over from more than a century of military, political, economic, and cultural aggression against China by imperialism and the traitorous flattery of foreign countries by the Kuomintang. It greatly boosted the morale of the people throughout the country, enhanced our nation's self-esteem and self-confidence, and raised the awareness of patriotism and internationalism, creating favorable conditions for the victorious socialist revolution.

The great struggle against American aggression has further consolidated and developed the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. In the days of battle, the Chinese People's Volunteers shared the same hardships and difficulties with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, fought side by side, supported each other, shed blood and sweat together, and won victory together. After the armistice was realized, they jointly carried out a resolute struggle to maintain the armistice agreement and defend the peaceful situation in Korea. The Korean people, fearing no difficulties or hardships, disregarding the serious destruction of their land, and heroically persisting in the struggle against American aggression, resisting the world's most powerful imperialist invading army, was the greatest help to our people. The Chinese People's Volunteers, while fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, also actively helped the Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore peaceful life. Seven years of experience have made the Chinese people further understand the close relationship between China and Korea, like lips and teeth, and understand the truth that resisting America and aiding Korea is precisely to protect our homes and defend the country. Seas may dry up and rocks may crumble, but the friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean peoples will last forever.

The arduous struggle to resist America and aid Korea also tempered and strengthened the strength of the Chinese people, enhanced the international status of the new China, and fully exposed the essence of the American imperialist being strong in appearance but weak in reality. This greatly encouraged the courage and confidence of the Asian and African people in the anti-colonial struggle. The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people also told the people of the world that peace cannot be obtained by begging; only by thwarting the aggressive flames of imperialism can war be effectively stopped and peace be won. All of these greatly encouraged the struggle of the people all over the world for peace and against war.

The great battle of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression will be immortalized in history! Glory belongs to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army!

Now there are even better conditions and more urgent needs for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The Chinese government and the Chinese people unanimously responded to and supported the Korean government's proposal on February 5 to immediately withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers have made a major decision to completely withdraw from Korea by the end of 1958. The whole world can see from this practical action that the efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are not empty words, but are put into action. So, as the other party in the Korean War, the American side that provoked the Korean War, what will it do? Will it use the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea as an opportunity to re-ignite the war of aggression? Or will it comply with the tide of world peace, respect the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification, and withdraw its troops from Korea?

Looking back at the lessons of history is not without benefit. When the Chinese People's Volunteers went to Korea to resist America and aid Korea, the American army had already approached China's doorstep. At that time, the equipment of the Chinese People's Volunteers was far inferior to that of the American army. An American division had hundreds of artillery pieces, while a volunteer division had only dozens of artillery pieces. The American army had powerful air force cover, while the Chinese and Korean sides had no aircraft participating in the frontline operations. However, even so, the American army was not able to hold onto the territory it occupied north of the 38th parallel, and finally fled in disgrace under the counterattack of the Chinese and Korean armies. People have already seen that seven years ago, the Chinese and Korean armies were able to repel the American invading army even when their weapons and equipment were far inferior to those of the enemy. So, now, when the strength of the Chinese and Korean people has far exceeded the situation in 1950, what can the United States still hope to gain from a war of aggression? The decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea precisely demonstrates the confidence of the Korean and Chinese sides in their own strength, the confidence in the strength of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the confidence in the peace forces of the people of the world. As the statement of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers pointed out: "If American imperialism and its followers dare to undermine the dignity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and launch another war of aggression against Korea, then as long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their outstanding sons and daughters once again to cross the Yalu River to fight together with the Korean People's Army to crush the enemy's aggression. Since the Chinese and Korean peoples were able to repel the frenzied offensive of American imperialism a few years ago, then today, when the strength of the Chinese and Korean peoples is even greater, and the international situation is already one where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, we are even more confident that we can inflict an even more disastrous defeat on the aggressors who re-launch the war than last time."

The American policy of strength has already gone bankrupt worldwide, and atomic cannons and rocket weapons can no longer scare anyone. Faced with the powerful demand for peace from the people of the world, the American authorities should be more sober. If the peace proposals announced by the American authorities are not false, then it should respond to the proposal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, take the same measures as the Chinese People's Volunteers, withdraw the American troops from South Korea, and let the Korean people solve their own problems and achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Of course, no matter what plans the United States and its followers make, the worldwide trend for peace is irresistible, and the will of the Korean people to resolutely achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea is irresistible. We believe that this just action of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea will surely receive the warm support of all peace-loving governments and people of all countries in the world. All peace-loving forces should take action and resolutely struggle to demand the withdrawal of troops from Korea by the United States and other countries.

    为了和平
    “中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。”这是1950年11月4日中国各民主党派联合宣言里所表达的中国人民的伟大意志。当时，为了执行中国人民的意志，中国人民的优秀儿女，组成中国人民志愿军，跨过鸭绿江，抗美援朝，保家卫国，同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一起，以劣势的装备抗击全副现代装备的美国侵略者，血战三年，制止了侵略，终于实现了朝鲜的停战，胜利地迈出了和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。现在，中国人民志愿军，响应朝鲜政府和平解决朝鲜问题的号召，同意中国政府建议，庄严地向全世界宣告：中国人民志愿军决定于1958年底全部撤出朝鲜，第一批将于4月30日以前撤完。中国人民为这一个重大决定而感到无比的自豪。光荣的中国人民志愿军曾经为了和平英勇地血洒朝鲜疆场，如今，又为了和平毅然决定离开那里的已经染遍了他们慷慨付出的血汗的美丽的河山。
    中国人民志愿军出国七年，为祖国，为人民，为亚洲和平，为世界和平，立下了万世不朽的功勋。
    谁都记得，美国在发动侵朝战争，同时霸占我国领土台湾的时候，何等猖狂。为它的暂时的得手冲昏了头脑的美国侵略者，对于中国人民的一再警告悍然不理，越过三八线以后，把战火烧向鸭绿江边，侵略矛头直逼中国；而侵朝美国空军，更放肆地入寇我国的东北领空，炸我城乡，杀我同胞，毁我财产；我国的安全遭到严重的威胁，中国人民忍无可忍，为了支援邻邦，为了保家卫国，才派出了自己的志愿军。虽然当时的条件是极端困难的，但是，中国人民志愿军不顾当时极端困难的物质条件，以大无畏的精神，和朝鲜人民肩并肩地击败了强大、凶恶的美国军队。三年苦战，朝中人民军队共同消灭敌军一百零九万，其中有美军三十九万之多；击落、击伤和缴获美国飞机一万二千多架，坦克三千多辆。美国侵略军败回到了三八线，打着“联合国”旗号的美国侵略军总司令终于不得不在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。
    中朝人民的抗美援朝的胜利战斗证明：当帝国主义妄想侵略我们，一定要把战争强加到我们的头上的时候，我们完全有力量打败它。战争的胜败，不决定于武器，而决定于人，胜利一定属于为正义、为反侵略而战的人民。在第二次世界大战以后，美国侵略者全力发动的最凶猛的一次局部战争，遭到可耻的失败。美国的实力政策破产了，美国纸老虎戳穿了。
    中朝人民伟大的抗美战争，也粉碎了美国侵占全部朝鲜、进而侵犯我国领土的狂妄计划。在1950年冬天的严重的日子里，新中国遭到了第一次最严重的考验。然而事实证明，掌握了自己命运的中国人民，是不可侮的。朝鲜战场上的胜利，保卫了我国的和平建设，保卫了我国人民的和平生活。伟大的抗美援朝运动，一扫崇美、恐美、媚美的思想——帝国主义一百多年对中国进行军事、政治、经济、文化侵略和国民党卖国媚外所遗留下来的思想毒素，大大振奋了全国人心，提高了我们民族的自尊心和自信心，提高了爱国主义和国际主义的觉悟，为胜利进行社会主义革命创造了有利的条件。
    伟大的反抗美国侵略的斗争，更加巩固和发展了中朝人民的传统友谊。在战斗的日子里，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军同艰苦，共患难，并肩作战，互相支援，一起流血流汗，一起赢得胜利；停战实现以后，又为维护停战协定、保卫朝鲜的和平局面，共同进行了坚决的斗争。朝鲜人民不怕一切困难艰苦，不顾国土遭受严重破坏，英勇地坚持反抗美国侵略的斗争，抗击世界上最强大的帝国主义侵略军队，是对我国人民的最伟大的帮助。中国人民志愿军，在同朝鲜人民军并肩作战的同时，还积极帮助了朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活。七年的经历，使得中国人民进一步领会到中朝两国唇齿相依的血肉关系，领会到抗美援朝正是保家卫国的真理。海可枯，石可烂，中朝人民鲜血结成的友谊万世常青。
    艰苦的抗美援朝斗争，也锻炼和壮大了中国人民的力量，提高了新中国的国际地位，充分暴露了美帝国主义的外强中干的实质。这就大大鼓舞了亚非人民反殖民主义斗争的勇气和信心。中朝人民的伟大胜利，也告诉了全世界人民：和平不是祈求可以得到的，只有挫败了帝国主义的侵略凶焰，才能有效地制止战争，赢得和平。所有这些，大大鼓舞了全世界人民争取和平、反对战争的斗争。
    中朝人民反抗美国侵略的伟大战斗永垂史册！光荣属于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军！
    现在和平解决朝鲜问题，已经有了更为良好的条件和更为迫切的需要。中国政府和中国人民一致响应和支持朝鲜政府2月5日提出的立即从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和实现朝鲜和平统一的各项建议。中国人民志愿军已经作出重大的决定，在1958年底全部撤出朝鲜。全世界都可以从这个实际行动中看到，朝中方面争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，不是徒托空言，而是说到做到。那么，作为朝鲜战争的另一方，挑起朝鲜战争的美国方面，究竟将怎么样呢？是利用中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，作为重新挑起侵略战争的可乘之机呢？还是顺应世界和平浪潮，尊重朝鲜人民和平统一的愿望，把军队撤出朝鲜呢？
    回溯一下历史的教训不是没有益处的。当中国人民志愿军出动抗美援朝的时候，美军已经逼近中国的大门口。当时，中国人民志愿军的装备，却远不能和美军相比，美军一个师有几百门大炮，志愿军一个师只有几十门大炮；美军有强大的空军作掩护，中朝方面没有一架飞机参与前线作战。可是，纵然如此，美军并没有能保住它侵占的三八线以北的阵地，终于在中朝军队的反击下狼狈逃窜。人们已经看到，七年前中朝军队在武器装备远不如人的情况下就已经能够击退美国侵略军，那么，现在，当中朝人民的力量已经远远超过了1950年的情况的时候，美国还能希望从侵略战争中得到什么呢？中国人民志愿军决定撤出朝鲜，正是表明了朝中方面对于自己力量的信心，对于以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营力量的信心，对于世界人民和平力量的信心。正像中国人民志愿军总部声明中所指出的：“如果美帝国主义和它的追随者胆敢破坏朝鲜停战协定的尊严，再一次发动侵朝战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再一次跨过鸭绿江来，同朝鲜人民军一起为粉碎敌人的侵犯而共同战斗。朝中两国人民既然能在几年前打退美帝国主义的疯狂进攻，那么，当今天中朝两国人民的力量更加强大，而国际形势已经是东风压倒西风的时候，我们就更有把握使重新发动战争的侵略者遭到比上次更加惨重的失败。”
    美国的实力政策已经在世界范围里破产了，原子大炮、火箭武器再也吓不倒人了。面对着全世界人民强大的和平要求，美国当局应该清醒一些了。如果美国当局所宣布的和平主张不是假的，那么它就应该响应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的建议，采取同中国人民志愿军相同的措施，从南朝鲜撤出美国军队，让朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题，实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    当然，不管美国和它的追随者将作什么样的打算，全世界要求和平的潮流是不可抗拒的，为坚决实现朝鲜的和平统一的朝鲜人民的意志是不可抗拒的。我们相信中国人民志愿军决定撤出朝鲜的这一正义行动，必将得到全世界一切爱好和平的各国政府和人民的热烈支持。一切爱好和平的力量应该行动起来，为要求美国和其他国家的军队撤出朝鲜而坚决斗争。
