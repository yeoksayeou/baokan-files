　　Relying on the Masses to Run Schools: More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
    Hebei Province's Masses Run Over 1,400 Middle Schools
    (Our Newspaper News) Since 1957, the privately-run middle schools in Hebei Province have greatly developed. Currently, the province has 1,448 privately-run junior middle schools and 4 privately-run senior middle schools; 2,028 junior middle school classes and 6 senior middle school classes; a total of 121,396 students (including 339 senior middle school students). This has satisfied the broad masses of farmers' urgent need for culture and cultivated talent for agricultural production. This is the result of the education leadership departments clarifying the direction of relying on the masses to run schools.
    The privately-run middle schools in Hebei Province began as early as 1953. At that time, the leadership's understanding of relying on the masses to run schools was not clear, and development was slow. In the summer of 1957, the province had over 399,000 higher primary school graduates, but the province's public middle schools could only enroll over 113,000 higher primary school graduates, far from meeting the cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. In that year, privately-run middle schools received the attention of the leadership and developed. According to statistics in October of that year, privately-run middle schools enrolled over 99,000 students, raising the enrollment rate of primary school graduates from 28% to over 50%.
    The establishment of privately-run middle schools, such as school buildings, funding, and teaching equipment, are all solved by the masses themselves, with assistance only given in resolving teacher issues. Dongyanghe Privately-Run Middle School in Huailai County was built by relying on the labor of the students. The school buildings were all solved by using the dilapidated houses in the village and slightly renovating them. The wood used was the public trees in the village, and the wages of the skilled workers who repaired the old houses were paid from the more than 200 yuan earned by the students working on the canal dam and in the farms. The teachers' salaries are provided by the sixty-two students participating in agricultural cooperative labor in their spare time, giving each teacher fifteen workdays per year. The entire school has three teachers, averaging 310 workdays per year per teacher, equivalent to a good agricultural laborer.
    The studies of students in privately-run middle schools can be combined with agricultural production. Some schools implement a half-day system, which not only strengthens students' labor training but also solves students' tuition and some living expenses. The full-day system can also be combined with production. Kouzhuang Privately-Run Middle School in Qian'an County is linked to the village's agricultural cooperative, assigning students tasks, and the cooperative assesses and records work points for the students. The privately-run middle school class in Nijing Township, Changli County, stipulates that during holidays, they will provide three labor days to the agricultural cooperative, and the cooperative will allocate funds to the school as school public expenses. Most privately-run middle schools in Fengrun County have formulated appraisal forms for students' labor during holidays, recording work points day by day, with the team leader appraising the labor situation. Many schools also mobilize students to cooperate in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. From the start of school on September 5th to the end of December last year, some students at Dongyanghe Privately-Run Middle School in Huailai County had already earned more than 200 work points participating in agricultural labor. In addition to personal expenses, the work points earned by students in privately-run middle schools across various regions during summer vacation, winter vacation, and busy farming season also subsidize their families. Many students proudly say, "We use our own labor to earn money and run our own schools."
    Privately-run middle schools are very popular among the masses. Attending middle school in the city costs more than 100 yuan per year, while attending a local privately-run middle school costs less than 80 yuan per year. In addition to study time, students can participate in labor for one-third of the time each year during holidays and Sundays. Male students can earn 50 to 110 workdays per year, and female students can earn 30 to 50 workdays per year. Privately-run middle schools are also conducive to opening doors to workers and peasants. According to statistics of 783 students in Ci County, poor and lower-middle peasants account for more than 93% (poor and lower-middle peasant students in urban public middle schools account for only about 80%). Privately-run middle schools have also cultivated talent for local agricultural cooperatives. Last year, the graduates of a privately-run middle school class in Qianxi County, except for two students who were admitted to senior high school, mostly participated in agricultural production, working as accountants, technicians, and other positions in local agricultural cooperatives.
    The main difficulty currently facing privately-run middle schools is the issue of teachers. The Hebei Provincial Department of Education plans to transfer and train approximately 2,000 teachers this summer vacation to further facilitate the smooth development of privately-run middle schools.

### 依靠群众办学　又多又快又好又省  河北省群众举办一千四百余处中学

　　依靠群众办学　又多又快又好又省
    河北省群众举办一千四百余处中学
    本报讯　河北省民办中学从1957年以来，有很大发展。现在全省有民办初级中学一千四百四十八处，民办高中四处；二千零二十八个初中班，六个高中班；共有学生十二万一千三百九十六人（内高中学生三百三十九人）。满足了广大农民对文化的迫切需要，为农业生产培养了人才。这是教育领导部门明确了依靠群众办学的方向的结果。
    河北省的民办中学，从1953年就已经开始了。当时领导上对依靠群众办学思想不明确，发展缓慢。1957年暑期，全省高小毕业生达三十九万九千多人，全省公立中学只能招收高小毕业生十一万三千多人，远不能满足广大人民对文化的要求。这一年，民办中学受到领导上的重视，得到了发展。当年10月份统计，民办中学招生九万九千多人，使小学毕业生升学率由28％提高到50％以上。
    民办中学的建立，如校舍、经费、教学用具等，都是群众自己解决的，只是在教师问题的解决上给予帮助。怀来县东洋河民办中学就是依靠学生的劳动建立起来的。这个学校的校舍都是利用本村的破旧房子，稍加修整解决的。所用木料是村里的公树，修建旧房的技术工工资，是学生们在渠坝上、农场里挣的二百多元工资里开支的。教师工资，由六十二个学生利用课余时间参加农业社的劳动，每人每年给教师十五个劳动日。全校三个教师，平均每人全年得三百一十个劳动日，顶一个好的农业劳动力。
    民办中学学生的学习，能与农业生产结合。有些学校实行半日制，不只能加强对学生的劳动锻炼，还能解决学生的学费和部分生活费用。采取整日制的也能与生产结合。迁安县扣庄民办中学和当村农业社联系，给学生包活，由社里给学生评工记分。昌黎县泥井乡民办中学班，规定假期给农业社作三个劳动日给当村农业社，由社给学校拨款，作为学校公杂费。丰润县多数民办中学都制定假期学生劳动情况鉴定表，逐日记载工分，并有队长鉴定劳动情况。还有许多学校发动学生配合兴修水利和积肥运动。怀来县东洋河民办中学，从去年9月5日开学到12月底，有些学生参加农业劳动已挣得二百多个工分。各地民办中学学生利用暑假、寒假和农忙假所挣工分除个人费用外，对家庭还有补助。许多学生自豪的说：“用自己的劳动，挣回钱来，办自己的学校。”
    民办中学很受群众欢迎。在城市上中学，每年要用一百元以上，在当地上民办中学，一年用不到八十元。学生除学习时间外，利用假期和星期日，每年可以有三分之一的时间参加劳动，男学生每年可挣五十到一百一十个劳动日，女生每年可挣三十到五十个劳动日。民办中学还有利于向工农开门。据磁县七百八十三个学生的统计，贫农、中农占93％以上（城市公立中学贫农中农学生只占80％左右）。民办中学还给当地农业社培养了人材。迁西县去年一个民办中学班毕业的学生，除两个学生升入高中外，大部学生都参加了农业生产，在当地农业社任会计、技术员等工作。
    现在民办中学的主要困难是师资问题。河北省教育厅拟于今年暑假抽调教员二千人左右加以培养训练，使民办中学得到进一步顺利的发展。
