　　The experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant in successfully abolishing unreasonable living and welfare benefits by organizing the worker masses to speak out freely and engage in extensive debate, which was published in this newspaper on December 30, 1957, has attracted attention from all sides. The Tongzhou Power Plant sent people to the Shijingshan Power Plant to understand the situation, and the Industrial Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee also organized a group of cadres from industrial and mining enterprises to study at the Shijingshan Power Plant, preparing to rely on the worker masses to revise some unreasonable rules and regulations after returning. However, it is regrettable that the Beijing Electric Power Administration and the Ministry of Electric Power, as the leading organs of the Shijingshan Power Plant, lack the enthusiasm they should have for this experience created by the masses. As of now, the Beijing Electric Power Administration and the Ministry of Electric Power have neither sent people to summarize the experience, nor requested the Shijingshan Power Plant to summarize the experience, let alone organized their affiliated enterprises to learn from it. Therefore, people cannot help but ask the Ministry of Electric Power and the Beijing Electric Power Administration: Do you approve or disapprove of this innovation of the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant?

　　Is the reason why the Ministry of Electric Power and the Beijing Electric Power Administration are so unenthusiastic about the experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant because there are no unreasonable rules and regulations that need to be revised in their other affiliated enterprises? No. For example, the phenomenon of excessively high safety bonus rates and overly broad reward coverage, which hinders production development, as exposed by the Shijingshan Power Plant workers during the rectification campaign, exists in many power plants. In terms of worker living and welfare benefits, violations of state regulations, such as not charging rent, water fees, or furniture fees for public housing, providing housing subsidies for private housing, and providing free or very low-cost medical treatment for workers' family members, also exist in many power plants and construction units, and are even more serious than in the Shijingshan Power Plant in some cases. Not to mention distant examples, the Third Engineering Bureau, directly under the Ministry of Electric Power right next to the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the business units under the Beijing Electric Power Administration in Beijing still implement the system of providing housing subsidies for private housing. These systems not only need to be revised, but in some cases, workers have already proposed revisions during the rectification campaign.

　　The support given by the Ministry of Electric Power was also insufficient when the Shijingshan Power Plant organized workers to debate unreasonable living and welfare benefit systems. For example, the Party Committee of the Shijingshan Power Plant believed that the time was ripe to abolish the system of free electricity for workers and hoped that the Ministry of Electric Power would agree to organize workers to discuss it. However, the Ministry of Electric Power believed that it could not be abolished and did not agree to organize workers to discuss it. Regarding the issue of the unreasonable safety reward system, the Shijingshan Power Plant also wanted to reform it by organizing worker debates, but it did not get the consent of the Ministry of Electric Power either.

　　The Beijing Electric Power Administration's lack of support for the masses' innovation is even more prominent. When the Shijingshan Power Plant decided, after mass debate, that from November 1957 onwards, all medical treatment for workers and their dependent direct relatives would be charged according to the labor insurance regulations, the Beijing Electric Power Administration immediately convened a meeting to discuss this issue. At the meeting, the comrades of the Administration all believed that it would not work to implement the labor insurance regulations, saying that the Shijingshan Power Plant had mobilized the masses and the problem was not big, but other units could not keep up, and that such inconsistencies within a region would cause confusion. On November 29, 1957, the Beijing Electric Power Administration also issued a "Supplementary Regulation on Medical Treatment for Workers and their Dependent Direct Relatives," requiring all enterprises in the Beijing area to comply with it. This regulation, in essence, played the role of dragging the Shijingshan Power Plant back. For example, the labor insurance regulations stipulate that workers should bear the cost of expensive medicines when receiving medical treatment at enterprise health stations or designated hospitals, but the Beijing Electric Power Administration and the Ministry of Electric Power stipulated that all medicines necessary for medical treatment, regardless of whether they are expensive or ordinary, should be fully covered by the enterprise. Another example is that when dependent direct relatives of workers receive medical treatment at the enterprise health station or designated hospital (the labor insurance regulations stipulate that the enterprise should bear half of the surgical fees and ordinary medicine fees, while the patient should bear the cost of expensive medicines, travel expenses, hospitalization fees, meals, and all other expenses), the Ministry of Electric Power and the Beijing Electric Power Administration stipulated that all examination, laboratory, and surgical fees should be waived when receiving medical treatment at the enterprise health station, and half of the medicine fees (regardless of whether they are expensive or ordinary) should be charged; when receiving medical treatment at a designated hospital, the enterprise should bear the cost of registration, ordinary examinations, and ordinary laboratory tests, while the enterprise should bear half of the surgical fees and medicine fees (regardless of whether they are expensive or ordinary), and blood transfusions, etc.

　　The Ministry of Electric Power has also made some efforts to revise unreasonable worker living and welfare benefit systems. For example, on September 16 last year, they issued a "Notice on Abolishing Unreasonable Housing Subsidy Systems." However, it only abolished the system of receiving housing subsidies while living in public housing, while the system of receiving housing subsidies while living in private housing was still retained. This time, their lack of support for the Shijingshan Power Plant's reliance on the masses to reform unreasonable rules and regulations, and their bureaucratic attitude of indifference towards the masses' innovation, is mainly due to the fear that other units will not be able to keep up and that problems will arise. This fully demonstrates that they do not have sufficient understanding of the socialist consciousness of the workers, and they do not believe that relying on the masses can do things well.

### 石景山发电厂依靠群众改革不合理制度的创举传遍全国  电力工业部对它无动于衷

　　石景山发电厂依靠群众改革不合理制度的创举传遍全国
    电力工业部对它无动于衷
    本报讯　石景山发电厂经过组织职工群众大鸣大放、大争大辩，成功地取消了不合理的生活福利待遇的经验，1957年12月30日在本报发表以后，引起了各方面的注意。通州发电厂曾经派人到石景山发电厂了解情况，中共湖北省委工业部也组织了一批工矿企业干部到石景山发电厂学习，准备回去以后依靠职工群众来修改一些不合理的规章制度。但是，令人遗憾的是：作为石景山发电厂的领导机关的北京电业管理局和电力工业部，对群众创造出来的这个经验，却缺乏应有的热情。截至目前为止，北京电业管理局和电力工业部既没有派人去总结经验，也没有要求石景山发电厂总结经验，更没有组织所属企业去学习。因此，人们不得不问一声电力工业部和北京电业管理局：你们对石景山发电厂职工群众的这个创举，到底是赞成呢，还是不赞成？
    电力工业部和北京电业管理局对石景山发电厂的经验这样不热情，是不是在它们所属的其它企业里没有不合理的规章制度需要修改呢？不是的。例如石景山发电厂职工在整风运动中揭发的安全奖金率过高，奖励面过广，妨碍生产发展的现象，在许多发电厂里都存在着。在职工生活福利待遇方面，如住公家房子不收房租、不收水费、不收家具费、住私人房子拿房贴、职工家属治病不收费或收费太低等等违反国家制度的现象，也在许多发电厂和工程单位里存在着，有的比石景山发电厂的还严重。远的且不说，就在石景山发电厂旁边由电力工业部直接领导的第三工程处，以及在北京市的北京电业管理局领导的营业单位，迄今还执行着住私房拿房贴的制度。这些制度不仅需要修改，而且在整风运动中，有些职工已经提出修改的意见来了。
    在石景山发电厂组织职工辩论不合理的生活福利待遇制度的时候，电力工业部给予的支持也是很不够的。例如中共石景山发电厂党委认为，取消职工用电不花钱的制度的时机已成熟，希望电力工业部同意他们组织职工讨论，但是，电力工业部认为不能取消，也不同意组织职工讨论。关于不合理的安全奖励制度问题，石景山发电厂也曾经想通过组织职工辩论加以改革，但也没有得到电力工业部的同意。
    北京电业管理局不支持群众的创举更为突出。当石景山发电厂经过群众辩论，决定从1957年11月份起，凡是职工和职工供养的直系亲属治病一律按照劳动保险条例规定收费的时候，北京电业管理局立即召开会议来讨论这个问题。会上，管理局的同志都认为，执行劳动保险条例规定行不通，说石景山发电厂发动了群众，问题不大，但别的单位跟不上来，这样，在一个地区内制度不统一，会造成混乱。1957年11月29日，北京电业管理局还发出一个“关于职工及职工供养的直系亲属医疗待遇的补充规定”，要求北京地区各企业一律遵照执行。这个规定，实质上起了拉石景山发电厂后腿的作用。例如劳动保险条例规定：职工因病在企业保健站或特约医院医疗时，贵重药费由本人负担，但是北京电业管理局和电力工业部却规定医疗上所必需的药品，不分贵重的和普通的，所需药费全部由企业负担。又如职工供养的直系亲属因病在本企业保健站或特约医院医疗时（劳保条例规定：手术费及普通药费，由企业负担一半，贵重药费、就医路费、住院费、住院膳费及其它一切费用，均由本人自理），电力工业部和北京电业管理局却规定：在企业保健站医疗时，一切检查、化验、手术等费免缴，药费（不分贵重与普通）收取二分之一；在特约医院医疗时，所需挂号费、普通检查费、普通化验费，由企业负担，手术费和药费（不分贵重与普通）、输血等，企业负担一半。
    电力工业部对修改不合理的职工生活福利待遇制度，也曾作过一些努力。例如去年9月16日，他们曾发出一个“关于取消不合理的房贴制度的通知”。但是，只取消了住公家房又拿房贴的制度，而对住私人房子拿房贴的制度仍然保留下来。这一次，他们对石景山发电厂依靠群众改革不合理的规章制度支持不够，对群众的创举采取无动于衷的官僚主义态度，主要原因是怕别的单位跟不上去，怕出乱子。这充分说明了他们对职工群众的社会主义觉悟没有足够的认识，他们不相信依靠群众能办好事情。
