Stop America's War Conspiracy in Asia

　　The Korean Military Armistice Commission held its 80th meeting on February 1st in Panmunjom. The chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, Jiang Shanghao, lodged the strongest protest against a series of serious violations of the armistice agreement by the United States, such as bringing atomic weapons into South Korea and holding provocative atomic strike exercises near the Demilitarized Zone. The Korean-Chinese side has pointed out that the U.S. unilaterally abolished Paragraph D of Article 13 of the armistice agreement, transporting new weapons into South Korea, in an attempt to make the U.S. military occupation of South Korea permanent, and turn South Korea into an American atomic base. Now, the accusation of the Korean-Chinese side has been confirmed as the United States openly admitted that it has transported atomic artillery into South Korea. The Korean-Chinese side demanded that the U.S. immediately cease such actions, immediately transport all illegally transported weapons, including atomic weapons, out of South Korea, and report this matter to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This is absolutely necessary in terms of safeguarding the integrity and effectiveness of the armistice agreement and consolidating the peaceful situation in Korea. However, the United States stubbornly refused this legitimate demand. This proves once again that the United States is unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, is unwilling to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, but is deliberately turning South Korea into a hotbed of atomic war and actively preparing for atomic war in the Far East.

　　Since the realization of the Korean armistice, there has been a struggle between two lines on the issue of maintaining the stability of the Korean armistice and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Korean-Chinese side has always resolutely abided by the various clauses of the Korean armistice agreement and made multifaceted efforts to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and transform the armistice state into a consolidated and lasting peace. However, the United States has consistently violated the armistice agreement and has been painstakingly trying to keep the armistice in an unstable state. Since the U.S. brazenly tore up Paragraph D of Article 13 of the armistice agreement last June, it has intensified its plan to turn South Korea into its atomic base. The chief representative of the U.S. side, Little Kist, repeated the fabricated clichés that had already been exposed, falsely accusing the Korean-Chinese side of violating the armistice agreement, saying that a series of illegal actions by the U.S. side, such as unilaterally abolishing Paragraph D of Article 13 of the armistice agreement and transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, were to "maintain military balance" and "for defense." This is entirely a cover-up of the truth, deceiving public opinion, and evading responsibility. The United States accuses the Korean-Chinese side of violating the armistice agreement, but cannot produce any tenable basis. Since the Korean armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn more than a dozen divisions and their equipment from Korea, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also reduced its army by 80,000 troops. But after the armistice, the United States expanded the so-called "ROK Army" from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions. The United States illegally imported weapons in violation of the armistice agreement, which has been repeatedly seized by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, so it rudely prohibited the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from operating in South Korea. Recently, U.S. General Trudeau, who commanded the atomic strike exercise, even publicly clamored that the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea should be trained into "offensive rather than defensive troops." Obviously, the U.S. side's so-called "maintaining military balance" and "for defense" are just clumsy excuses.

　　The U.S. deliberately destroying the Korean armistice agreement and turning South Korea into its atomic base is inseparable from its conspiracy to create tension in Asia and the world. Following the planning of establishing missile bases in Western Europe, the United States is also planning to turn the Baghdad Pact countries into its missile bases. In the Far East, the United States has built missile bases in Okinawa and sent missile forces to Taiwan; now it is actively planning to transport missiles into Japan and South Korea. At the same time, the United States is also actively planning to link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Treaty Group, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The United States wants to use the practice of establishing missile bases around the world, distributing atomic bombs and missiles to other countries, and strengthening military groups under its command to poison the international atmosphere and threaten world peace.

　　However, these crazy arms expansion activities of the United States are not enough to show its strength, but only show that the United States is still trying to struggle desperately under the situation of the bankruptcy of its policy of strength. In order to save its decline, the United States attempts to use atomic cannons, missile bases, and bluffs to strengthen military control over its client states, curb the centrifugal tendencies of its client states, and maintain the increasingly disintegrating North Atlantic Group, Baghdad Treaty, Southeast Asia Treaty, and other military groups. Obviously, this atomic arms expansion activity will only bring terrible disasters to those countries and regions that accept atomic weapons and establish missile bases.

　　Today, the powerful trend of peace in the world is surging forward. The Soviet Union's proposals to hold a high-level meeting of Eastern and Western countries to achieve disarmament, stop the testing and use of nuclear weapons, and to establish nuclear-free zones in Central Europe and the Middle East have increasingly penetrated the hearts of the people and won increasingly broad approval and support. In the Asian and African regions, the call for peace and no war has also formed a rising wave. The envoys of 1.7 billion people from Asia and Africa attending the Cairo Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference unanimously advocated declaring atomic weapons illegal and advocated negotiations between the East and West. The people of Okinawa, by electing someone whom the U.S. opposes as the mayor of Naha, the capital of Okinawa, expressed their protest against the U.S. occupation of Okinawa and turning Okinawa into a missile base. The Japanese government's acceptance of the U.S. "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles has aroused the indignation of the people across the country. Recently, Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, suggested declaring Asia a nuclear weapon-free zone, which undoubtedly reflects the peace aspirations of the vast majority of the Japanese people. The Egyptian government issued a statement clearly opposing the establishment of atomic weapons bases and rocket bases in the Middle East. Indian Prime Minister Nehru warned that if atomic bombs come to Asia, they will cause a terrible wave of opposition everywhere. The U.S.'s perverse actions will only make it more isolated.

　　The signing of the Korean armistice agreement was the result of the efforts of the Korean and Chinese people for peace in Korea, and it was also the result of the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world. The people of the world all hope that the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully. To peacefully resolve the Korean issue, we must first abide by the armistice agreement, and the armistice must lead to a consolidated peace. In order to establish a unified, independent, and free Korea, and to avoid new war disasters, the people of southern Korea should, together with the people of northern Korea, resolutely oppose the threat of American atomic war, demand that the United States withdraw atomic cannons and rocket weapons, and abide by the Korean armistice agreement. The Chinese people fully support the protests and demands made by the Korean-Chinese side to the U.S. side at the Korean Military Armistice Commission, and will, together with the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world, take all effective steps to stop the U.S. conspiracy to prepare for atomic war in Korea and Asia, and resolutely fight to the end for the consolidation of peace in Korea and Asia.

### 制止美国在亚洲的战争阴谋

　　制止美国在亚洲的战争阴谋
    朝鲜军事停战委员会于2月1日在板门店举行第八十次会议。朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊对于美国把原子武器运进南朝鲜、并在非军事区附近举行挑衅性的原子突击演习等一系列严重破坏停战协定的行为提出了最强硬的抗议。朝中方面曾经指出：美国片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项，把新式武器运进南朝鲜，是企图使美军对南朝鲜的占领永久化，把南朝鲜变为美国的原子基地。现在，由于美国公开承认已把原子炮运进南朝鲜，朝中方面的这种指责已经得到证实。朝中方面要求美方立即停止这种行动，立即从南朝鲜运出非法运入的包括原子武器在内的所有武器，并就这件事向军事停战委员会、中立国监察委员会提出报告。从维护停战协定的完整性和有效性、巩固朝鲜的和平局面来说，这是完全必要的。但是美国方面却蛮横地拒绝了这一正当的要求。这又一次证明：美国是不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的，是不愿意实现朝鲜的和平统一的，而是蓄意要把南朝鲜变为原子战争温床，在远东积极准备原子战争。
    朝鲜停战实现以来，在维持朝鲜停战的稳定和实现朝鲜和平统一的问题上，一直存在着两条路线的斗争。朝中方面一贯坚决遵守朝鲜停战协定的各项条款，为促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，使停战状态能转变为巩固持久的和平，作了多方面的努力。但是美国方面却一贯破坏停战协定，处心积虑地想使停战处于不稳定状态。去年6月美国悍然撕毁停战协定第十三款卯项以后，更加加紧进行了把南朝鲜变为它的原子基地的计划。美方首席代表小基斯特，重复早已被揭穿了的捏造的滥调，诬指朝中方面违反停战协定，说什么美方片面废除停战协定第十三款卯项、把原子武器运进南朝鲜的一系列非法行为，是为了“保持军力均衡”，“为了防御”。这完全是掩盖事实真相，欺骗舆论和规避责任。美国诬指朝中方面违反停战协定，却举不出任何站得住脚的根据。朝鲜停战以来，中国人民志愿军已从朝鲜撤出十几个师和它的装备，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国也裁减了八万军队。但美国在停战以后却把南朝鲜的所谓“国军”从停战时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师。美国违反停战协定非法运入武器，曾被中立国视察小组多次查获，因此它才粗暴地禁止了中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的活动。最近，指挥原子突击演习的美国将军特鲁多更公开叫嚣说，要把驻在南朝鲜的美国部队训练成为“进攻的而不是防御的部队”。很明显，美方所谓“保持军力均衡”，“为了防御”等等，都不过是一些拙劣的借口。
    美国蓄意破坏朝鲜停战协定，把南朝鲜变成它的原子基地，是和它在亚洲以及全世界制造紧张局势的阴谋分不开的。美国继策划在西欧建立导弹基地之后，又策划把巴格达集团国家变为它的导弹基地。在远东地区，美国已在冲绳修建了导弹基地，并向台湾派驻了导弹部队；现在又积极策划把导弹运进日本和南朝鲜。同时，美国还积极策划把北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约集团和东南亚条约集团联结起来。美国想用在世界各地建立导弹基地、把原子弹和导弹分送给其它国家和加强在它指挥下的军事集团的作法，来毒化国际气氛，威胁世界和平。
    但是，美国这些疯狂的备战活动，并不足以表明它的强大，而只是表明了美国在实力政策破产的形势下还想拚命挣扎。为了挽救它的颓势，美国企图用原子大炮、导弹基地、虚张声势，借以加强对仆从国家的军事控制，制止仆从国家的离心倾向，维系日益分崩离析的北大西洋集团、巴格达条约、东南亚条约等各个军事集团。很明显，这种原子备战活动，只会给那些接受原子武器和建立导弹基地的国家和地区，带来可怕的灾难。
    今天，世界上强大的和平潮流正在汹涌而进。苏联提出的举行东西方国家高级会议，以实现裁减军备、停止试验和使用核武器的建议、关于建立中欧和中东无原子区的主张，已经日益深入人心，赢得了日益广泛的赞同和支持。在亚非地区，要和平、不要战争的呼声也形成了日益高涨的浪潮。出席开罗亚非人民团结大会的亚非十七亿人民的使者，一致主张宣布原子武器为非法，并且主张东西方之间进行谈判。冲绳人民用选举美国所敌视的人作为冲绳首府那霸市长的行动，表示了他们对于美国霸占冲绳、变冲绳为导弹基地的抗议。日本政府接受美国的“响尾蛇”式空空导弹，已引起全国人民的愤慨。最近，日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三建议宣布亚洲为无原子武器区，这无疑是反映了日本广大人民的和平愿望的。埃及政府发表声明，明确表示反对在中东建立原子武器基地和火箭基地。印度总理尼赫鲁发出警告：原子弹到亚洲来将会到处引起反对它的可怕的浪潮。美国倒行逆施，只会使它更加陷于孤立。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，是朝中两国人民为朝鲜和平而努力的结果，同时也是世界爱好和平人民努力的结果。全世界人民都希望朝鲜问题能够得到和平解决。而要和平解决朝鲜问题，首先必须遵守停战协定，必须使停战导向巩固的和平。为了建立统一、独立和自由的朝鲜，为了避免新的战争灾难，朝鲜南部的人民应当同朝鲜北部的人民一起，坚决反对美国原子战争的威胁，要求美国撤出原子大炮和火箭武器，遵守朝鲜停战协定。中国人民完全支持朝中方面在朝鲜军事停战委员会上向美方所提出的抗议和要求，并且将同朝鲜人民、全世界爱好和平的人民一起，采取一切有效步骤，为制止美国在朝鲜和亚洲准备原子战争的阴谋，为巩固朝鲜和亚洲的和平而坚决斗争到底。
