　　Past Bean Counting, Today Pens in Hand
    Yazhukeng in Ningguo County Eliminates Illiteracy with Revolutionary Spirit

    (Our report) Hefei - Yazhukeng in Ningguo County, Anhui Province, is a remote and rugged small mountainous area, now a model village in eliminating illiteracy. It is a production team of the Dongshan Production Cooperative, with 33 households scattered in a ten-li-long mountain valley. In the years since liberation, this remote mountain village, where only two people could read, has relied on the masses to run schools themselves, basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, becoming an advanced banner in Ningguo County's literacy campaign.

    As early as 1952, mutual aid teams were established here. Everyone used broad beans to record work points, but unfortunately, the "bean accounts" were messed up by mice, and some team members wanted to withdraw from the team. The team leader was so worried that he asked the young people in the team to make sure the winter school was run well. In that year, the Youth League organization was established, and a winter school committee was formed. All four Youth League members in the village became the backbone of running the winter school. Wang Yinglu was the principal, Zhou Benwang was the civilian teacher, and the other two Youth League members were the study group leaders. Everyone's enthusiasm for learning was particularly high, and they wrote a quick-clapper rhyme to compare the new and old societies: "Facing the loess and with our backs to the sky, we never touched the school door, chopping firewood and herding cattle were the two things, the true inheritance of our ancestors. Since the Communist Party came, everyone goes to school and reads, we work and study, production and learning are both complete."

    In January 1953, a fire accidentally broke out, burning down the school's house and gasoline lamps. Everyone was not discouraged and immediately took action. Women carried soil, and men built walls and thatched roofs. In less than half a month, the house was built, and new desks and benches were made, and the inside and outside were painted anew. After this struggle against difficulties, the farmers were even more motivated to learn.

    With a few years of winter school foundation, in the spring of 1956, the masses demanded to run civilian schools and insisted on year-round learning. To run a year-round civilian school, the first difficulty encountered was the problem of lamp oil. At this time, the Youth League members mobilized and organized the students to collectively chop firewood, make tea, carry bamboo, pick wooden boards, collect tree seeds, reclaim wasteland, and accumulate fertilizer to ensure the regular expenses of the civilian school.

    The Youth League organization also paid attention to ensuring that students' cultural studies would not be interrupted during the busy farming season, proposing the slogan "stop teaching but not stop learning" to the students, and dividing the study groups according to the three production teams, with the work recorders acting as young teachers and the squad leaders acting as study group leaders. Therefore, even during the busiest times of spring rice transplanting and tea picking, the students could still bring blackboards to the fields to review their lessons, help each other learn.

    After years of diligent study and hard work, the cultural face of Yazhukeng has undergone fundamental changes. Now, there are a total of 59 young and middle-aged people in the village, 41 of whom have shed their illiteracy, 4 are studying in primary school, and 76.2% of the young and middle-aged people have eliminated illiteracy. And among the 33 young people, except for one semi-illiterate person, all have eliminated illiteracy. The number of people using pens has increased in this remote mountain village. It has not only jumped to become an advanced village in Ningguo County in terms of culture, but also has become the only model team in the cooperative in terms of production.

　　过去豆子记账　今天笔杆成行
    宁国县压竹坑用革命精神扫除文盲
    本报讯　安徽省宁国县压竹坑是一个交通闭塞，山岭崎岖的小山区，现已成为扫盲的先进村。这里是东山生产合作社的一个生产大队，全队三十三户人家，散居在一个十里长的山沟里。解放几年来，这个交通不便，仅有两个人认字的山村，依靠群众自己办学，基本上扫除了青壮年中的文盲，成为宁国县扫盲工作上的一面先进旗帜。
    还是在1952年，这里成立了互助组。大家用蚕豆记工，不幸“豆子账”被老鼠搞乱了，有的组员闹着要退组。组长急得没办法，要求组内青年一定要把冬学办好。就在这一年，建立了团的组织，成立了冬学委员会。全村仅有的四个团员，都成了搞冬学的骨干。王应禄当校长，周本旺做民师，另外两个团员做学习小组长。大家的学习情绪特别高涨，编了快板来对比新旧两个社会：“面朝黄土背朝天，学校门槛不沾边，打柴放牛两件事，是祖宗留下的真本钱。自从来了共产党，大家上学把书念，干了活儿又读书，生产学习两样全”。
    1953年1月里，不慎失火，把学校的房子和汽油灯全烧掉了。大家并没泄气，马上行动起来。妇女挑土，男的筑墙、盖草，不出半个月，房子盖好了，还做了新的桌椅板凳，里里外外粉刷一新。经过这一番和困难作斗争，农民们学习的劲头更足了。
    有了几年的冬学基础，1956年春天，群众要求办民校，坚持常年学习。要办常年民校，头一椿碰到的困难就是灯油问题不好解决。这时，团员们就发动和组织学员集体打柴，做茶叶，驮毛竹，挑木板，采树种，开荒，积肥，保证了民校的经常费用。
    团组织还注意了在农忙时，使学员学文化也不致中断，向学员们提出“停教不停学”的口号，并且按三个生产队划分学习小组，由记工员当小先生，分队长当学习小组长。因此，在春天插秧、摘茶最忙的时候，学员们仍能带着黑板下地，复习功课，互助学习。
    经过了几年来的勤学苦练，压竹坑的文化面貌已经起了根本变化。现在，全村共有青壮年五十九人，有四十一人摘掉了文盲帽子，有四人在小学念书，76.2％的青壮年扫除了文盲。而在三十三个青年当中，除了一个半文盲外，全部扫除了文盲。这个闭塞的小山村，用笔杆的人多起来了。它不仅在文化上一跃而成为宁国县的先进村，而且在生产上也成为社里唯一的模范队。
