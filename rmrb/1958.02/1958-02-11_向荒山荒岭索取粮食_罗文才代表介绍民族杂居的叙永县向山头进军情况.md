Extracting Grain from Barren Mountains and Ridges
Representative Luo Wencai Introduces the Situation of Xuyong County's Advance into the Mountains, Where Various Ethnic Groups Live Together
More Than 100,000 Labor Troops March Vigorously, Advancing with Hundredfold Courage Towards Mountains of All Sizes
I fully agree with and endorse all the reports of the conference.

Xuyong County in Sichuan is a high-altitude mountainous area where various ethnic groups live together. Mountains upon mountains, ranges upon ranges, mountains everywhere, with very few flatlands. In such an area, is it possible to achieve the grain production increase requirements of the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program? We believe it is entirely possible. Moreover, according to the county party committee's plan, by 1962, the county's total grain output could be increased from an average yield of 316 jin per mu in 1956 to 800 jin per mu. Achieving the target of 800 jin per mu by 1962 requires a great leap forward in 1958 – this is crucial. Currently, over 100,000 labor troops in our county are marching vigorously and with hundredfold courage towards mountains of all sizes. The momentum is tremendous, because our peasant brothers understand in their hearts that only by developing those barren mountains and ridges where wild animals hide and planting crops can we reliably guarantee our great leap forward. Before I came to the conference, I worked on Luoguo Mountain. This mountain is not large, only fifty li in circumference and eight hundred meters high, with a cliff on one side and a steep slope on the other. Before liberation, only one farmer reclaimed land there, harvesting 1,500 jin of corn each year. Later, that farmer fell off the cliff and died, and the mountain became even more deserted and no one cared about it anymore.

The "Frowning" Luoguo Mountain Transformed into an Elegant and Refined Mountain
This project began on December 5th last year. Including cadres, students, and residents sent to support from Zhengyou Township, Dashu Township, and the county seat, there were more than 2,600 people working on the mountain every day. Gongs and drums resounded, and red flags covered the mountain, even more lively than the New Year. The slogan put forward by this labor army was: "Not afraid of cold, not afraid of hunger, Luoguo Mountain must admit its mistake to me!" Everyone brought dry rations and went up the mountain before dawn, returning only after dark. It rained several times, but very few people were absent. They always had the energy to see it through to the end. They were determined to "put a hat on the top of the mountain, a belt around the waist of the mountain, and put on armor, shoes on the feet of the mountain, and nails on the soles of the shoes." Once the masses are mobilized, their great strength is invincible. By early January, this Luoguo Mountain, which had been consigned to oblivion and was frowning, was completely transformed, becoming elegant and refined.

Putting a hat on the top of the mountain means that we planted 250,000 oil tea trees, 500,000 ordinary tea trees, and 10,000 pine trees on the top of the mountain. We are also preparing to plant 250,000 mulberry trees. This hat may be more valuable than the hat worn by the emperors of the feudal era, because in three years, just taking the tea trees as an example, we can harvest 288,000 jin of oil tea seeds and 15,400 jin of ordinary tea leaves each year. Putting a belt around the waist and putting on armor means opening interception ditches and digging water storage ponds on the waist of the mountain; putting shoes on the feet and nails on the soles means building stone embankments and planting trees at the foot of the mountain. The purpose is to do a good job in soil and water conservation. Putting on armor and belting the waist means building retaining walls with stones for the slopes and terraced fields developed all over the mountain, and digging sand-trapping ditches and water storage ponds to prevent any soil and water loss. These slopes and terraced fields can yield 164,000 jin of grain each year, equivalent to ten times the yield before development.

County Party Secretary Leads the Development of Renzuban Mountain, Aiming for an Annual Production of 120,000 Jin of Grain
There are also two springs on the top of Luoguo Mountain, and in the future, we also plan to turn most of the terraced slopes into terraced fields. This will allow it to produce more grain for the country. Therefore, I say that we are entirely likely to complete the grain production increase tasks proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule. Now let me talk about our other mountain advance. This mountain is called Renzuban Mountain, about sixty li in circumference, a little shorter than Luoguo Mountain, only seven hundred meters high, and ten li away from the city. There is very little cultivated land, and the mountain is full of barren slopes and soil. It is estimated that developing it can increase grain production by 120,000 jin. The labor army developing these barren mountains and soil is mainly composed of office cadres, students, and residents in the county seat, because there are very few farmers on and at the foot of the mountain. When I came to Beijing, the county was mobilizing an average of more than 7,000 people every day to go to the mountain to fight against nature. As with the conquest of Luoguo Mountain, the sound of singing and the sound of hoes and shovels intertwined, and everyone was working enthusiastically.

During the period of great airing of views in May and June last year, the rightists in the county-level organs always viciously slandered our socialist system and viciously slandered our party and agricultural collectivization. This time, we gathered these guys together and also brought them to Renzuban Mountain to participate in labor, so that they could gain more knowledge and receive more education, and transform themselves through labor. As Vice Premier Bo Yibo said, we must turn poisonous weeds into fertilizer. These rightists are generally relatively honest, and some even have some methods. An agricultural section chief who is a rightist is also willing to honestly transform himself in labor and production under the influence of the overwhelming enthusiasm of the masses. If they sincerely want to transform themselves from labor production and be good people, there will one day be a time when the masses can consider taking off their hats. The development of Renzuban Mountain is personally led by the county party secretary. I have calculated the days, and this mountain may have already been dressed up as beautifully as Luoguo Mountain.

In Zhancao Township and Wenhua Township, where most of the farmers are Miao, the enthusiasm of the masses to advance into the mountains is also amazing. These two townships are all large mountains, with very little farmland and little cultivated land. They are choosing five mountains, Miaogou, Wujiaping, Dawan, Baiche, and Daping, to advance. These five mountains are all larger than Luoguo Mountain. The Miao and Han peasant brothers are preparing to completely conquer them within three years, which can increase grain production by 8 million jin. This year, we strive to increase production by 200,000 jin. At the same time, we are jointly opening a 55-li-long canal with the farmers of Haiba Township. This canal is named the Liberation Canal. It will cut through mountains and ridges to bring water from Zhancao Township to Haiba Township, turning many terraced slopes into terraced fields, and ensuring that ordinary winter paddy fields will never lack water and can guarantee a good harvest every year. It is estimated that 1,500 mu of new fields can be opened, increasing grain production by 800,000 jin to 1 million jin. The slogan put forward by the masses is: "If the ditch is not open, we will not relax! If the water does not reach the fields, we will not go home for the New Year!" This project may also be completed by now.

Of course, there is more than one way to increase grain production, but expanding the cultivated area by advancing into the mountains is an important task for our mountainous areas. At the same time, this work is also very arduous. However, after the rural great debate and the party's socialist education for farmers, the consciousness of the masses has been raised, the revolutionary enthusiasm has been increased, and the ambition for the great leap forward in production has also risen. Any difficulties will be overcome. I believe that our county's approximately 10,000 large and small barren mountains and ridges will gradually be beautifully dressed up by us in the image of Luoguo Mountain!

    向荒山荒岭索取粮食
    罗文才代表介绍民族杂居的叙永县向山头进军情况
    十多万劳动大军浩浩荡荡  勇气百倍向大小山头进军
    我完全同意和拥护大会的各项报告。
    四川叙永县是民族杂居的高山区。重重山，叠叠山，到处是山，平坝地区很少。在这样的地区是否能够实现农业发展纲要四十条粮食增产的要求呢？我们认为完全可以做到，而且还可能按照县委的规划，到一九六二年，把全县粮食产量，从一九五六年的每亩平均产量三百一十六斤，提高到每亩平均产量八百斤的指标，要求一九六二年达到亩产八百斤的指标，一九五八年一定得来一个大跃进，这是一个关键。目前我县十余万劳动大军，正浩浩荡荡，勇气百倍地向大大小小的山头进军，声势非常浩大，因为我们农民兄弟心里明白，只有把那些飞禽走兽藏身的荒山荒岭开发出来，种上庄稼，我们的大跃进才算有了可靠的保证。我来开会之前，就搞了一个罗锅山。这座山不算大，周围只有五十里路，八百公尺高，一面悬岩，一面陡坡。解放前，只有一个农民在上面开荒，每年收一千五百斤玉麦，后来那个农民栽岩跌死了，这座山从此更冷冷清清，再也没有人管它了。
    “愁眉苦脸”的罗锅山  变得衣冠楚楚眉清目秀
    这个工程是去年十二月五日开始的。连同正友乡、大树乡以及县城里派来支援的干部、学生、居民，每天一共有二千六百多人在山上工作。锣鼓喧天，满山红旗，比逢年过节还要热闹，这支劳动大军提出的口号是：“不怕冷，不怕饿，罗锅山得向我认错。”大家不等天亮就带起干粮上山，直到天黑才回。有好几次下雨，可是很少有人缺勤，他们总是有一股子劲要干到底。决心要把这座山的“山顶戴帽子，山腰缠带子，并披上铠甲，山脚穿上鞋子，鞋底钉上钉子”。群众一旦发动起来，他们的伟大力量是所向无敌的。到了一月初旬，就把这座打入冷宫、愁眉苦脸的罗锅山，硬是完全打扮出来了，变得衣冠楚楚、眉清目秀了。
    所谓山顶戴帽子，就是我们在山顶种了二十五万株油茶树，五十万株普通茶树和一万株松树。接着还准备栽上二十五万株桑树。这顶帽子可能比封建时代皇帝老倌戴的帽子还要贵重，因为三年以后，单拿茶树来说，我们就可以每年收油茶籽二十八万八千斤，普通茶叶一万五千四百斤。所谓山腰缠带子披上铠甲，就是要在山腰开拦山沟，挖蓄水塘；所谓山脚穿鞋子，鞋子上钉钉子，就是在山脚砌上石坎并栽上树木，其目的是为了做好水土保持工作；所谓披铠甲、缠带子就是为遍山开发出来的坡土梯土，用石头做好保坎工程，还要挖囤沙沟蓄水塘，不让有一点水土流失了。这些坡土、梯土每年可收粮食十六万四千斤，相当于未开发前的十倍。
    县委书记领导开发人足板山  要它每年生产十二万斤粮食
    罗锅山顶上还有两股泉水，将来还准备将大部梯土变成为梯田，这一来它将为国家生产更多的粮食，所以我说我们完全有可能提前五年完成农业发展纲要所提出的粮食增产任务。现在请让我谈一谈我们的另一个山头进军的情况吧。这座山叫人足板山，周围有六十多里路，比罗锅山矮一点，只有七百公尺高，离城有十里路，熟地很少，满山荒坡、荒土，估计开发出来可以增产十二万斤粮食。开发这些荒山，荒土的劳动大军，主要是县城里的机关干部、学生和居民。因为该山山上、山下的农民都很少。我来北京的时候，由县里每天动员到该山上去和大自然作斗争的平均有七千多人，跟征服罗锅山的情况一样，唱歌声和锄头铁锹声交织成一片，大家都在热情地劳动。
    在去年五六月间，大鸣大放的时候，县一级机关里的右派分子，总是恶毒地诬蔑我们的社会主义制度，恶毒地诬蔑我们党和农业合作化。这一次我们把这些家伙集中起来，也带到人足板山上参加劳动，让他们多长一些见识，多受一点教育，从劳动中去改造他们。像薄一波副总理所说的一样，我们要把毒草变成肥料。这些右派分子一般还算比较老实，有的还有一些办法，有个农业科长是个右派，在群众排山倒海的热情劳动的影响下，也还愿意规规矩矩的在劳动生产中去改造自己。如果他们真诚的愿意从劳动生产中去改造自己做好人，总会有一天群众可以考虑摘掉他的帽子的，开发人足板山是县委书记亲自领导的，我计算了一下日子，这座山头可能已经照罗锅山那样，已经被打扮出来了。
    在苗族农民最多的栈槽乡、文化乡，群众向山头进军的干劲也很惊人。这两个乡全是大山，田很少，耕地也不多。他们正选择了苗沟、吴家坪、大弯、白撤、大坪上等五个山头进军。这五座山头都比罗锅山大，苗、汉农民兄弟，准备在三年内完全征服它们，一共能增产粮食八百万斤。今年争取增产二十万斤。同时联合海坝乡农民正开一条五十五里路长的堰沟。这条堰沟已命名为解放大堰，它要穿山越岭，把水从栈槽乡引到海坝乡去，使许多梯地变成梯田，并叫一般冬水田永不缺水，每年都能保证丰收。估计可开新田一千五百亩，增产粮食八十万斤到一百万斤。群众提出的口号是：“沟不通，不放松！水不到田，不回去过年！”这项工程目前也可能完工了。
    当然增产粮食的办法并不止这一项，但是向山头进军来扩大耕地面积，对我们高山地区说来，都是一项重要的工作。同时这个工作也很艰巨。但是，经过农村大辩论和党对农民进行的社会主义教育，群众的觉悟高了，革命干劲大了，生产大跃进的雄心也跟着高涨了，任何困难都会被克服的。我相信，我们全县大约一万个大大小小的荒山荒岭，一定都会逐步让我们按照罗锅山的面貌，把它们漂漂亮亮地打扮出来！
