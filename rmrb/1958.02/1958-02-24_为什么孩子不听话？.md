Why Are Children Disobedient?
    Jing Sheng

Many parents often complain that their children are disobedient, often attributing the cause of disobedience to the child's innate bad temper. In fact, if you carefully examine the reasons why children are disobedient, it is mostly the parents' fault, because these are the results of their own education.
        “Be obedient!”

Some parents, in order to make their children obedient, try their best to create the impression in front of their children that "only they are right." I once saw such a mother who often asked her child behind their back, "Do you like Dad or Mom?" The child slowly learned to please, hugging the mother's leg and saying, "I like you." This mother was extremely doting on the child. Sometimes, when the child made a mistake, no one else could say anything or control them. If the father criticized or punished the child's wrong behavior, the mother would protect them on the sidelines, arbitrarily changing or canceling the father's decision. When the child didn't even listen to her, she became furious, raising her hand to hit and opening her mouth to scold, "Why don't you listen to me?"

Merely destroying consistent family education to maintain personal authority, without paying attention to the educational effect, and even resorting to beating and scolding, is very harmful to children. The prestige established in this way is also false prestige. As a result, the child does not know what is right or wrong, so that the child does not listen to anyone. In the eyes of these parents, it seems that what they want the child to obey is not the truth, but the individual. We educate children to be obedient in order to fulfill the task of moral education, not to teach them to blindly obey. If we don't care about right or wrong, but just demand that the child "be obedient! be obedient!" it has no educational significance for the child.
        The Result of Spoiling

Mao Mao is an only child, and everyone in the family likes him very much. Whatever the child wants, they buy it. When the mother comes home from work, she either brings some sweets or some small trinkets. Therefore, as soon as she gets home, the child grabs the mother's handbag, "Mom, what did you buy for me again?" If she didn't buy anything, he would be unhappy and even cry and make a scene. The grandmother reconciles from the side, saying, "Don't cry, don't cry, let Mom buy it for you tomorrow." The mother had no choice but to agree to this request.

Every parent loves their children, but they cannot be spoiled, nor can they simply use satisfying certain material desires of the children to exchange for their happiness. The result of doing so is that the child thinks that it is a matter of course for parents to satisfy his unreasonable demands. An even worse consequence is the development of the child's willful, spoiled, and disobedient habits.
      Cry again, and I won't buy you anything!

On Sunday, the father bought the child a box of building blocks. Once the child started playing, he forgot everything. He didn't even want to eat lunch when his mother called him. The mother didn't understand the child's mood, got angry, scolded him for being disobedient, angrily snatched the building blocks from his hand, and forcibly dragged him to the dining table to eat. The child cried. The mother shouted loudly, "Cry again, and I won't buy you anything!"

Letting the child eat with tears in his eyes is not good for the child's health, and more importantly, you should understand and educate the child. If you remind him in advance that it's time to eat, put away the building blocks, and play after dinner. If you say this to him calmly, the child will be happy to obey. Using material inducements to teach children to be obedient cannot achieve the result of educating children.
      What you say must be done

Mom and Dad made a new rule for the child, "Wash your hands before eating." This was done for two days, but on the third day, the child didn't wash his hands before eating, and the mother didn't pay attention. One day, the child went to eat again without washing his hands, and the mother finally opened her mouth, "If you want to eat, wash your hands first. How many times have I told you? Why don't you ever listen!"

At this time, the child questioned his mother's words. Why didn't Mom care about it the last few days when he didn't wash his hands before eating? Saying but not doing, or doing but not doing it to the end, is a fatal injury in children's education work and is also the place where parents are most likely to lose prestige. Experienced parents, after proposing that they wash their hands before eating, will let the child do it. If he doesn't wash his hands before eating, let him wash his hands before eating. This can not only cultivate children's habit of loving cleanliness, but more importantly, it can arouse children's attention to their mother's words and develop the habit of listening and obeying.

Children are very sensitive to their parents' words and deeds and have strict requirements. When a child is disobedient, you should carefully study why the child is disobedient and then prescribe the right medicine. At the same time, I would also like to say: If you want to educate your children to be obedient, you must correctly cultivate the prestige of your parents, because what children respect and obey are only those who have prestige in their minds.

### 为什么孩子不听话？

    为什么孩子不听话？
    京生
    许多父母时常抱怨自己的孩子不听话，往往还把不听话的原因归之于孩子天生的脾气坏。其实如果认真检查一下小孩子不听话的原因，多半还是父母的过错，因为这些都是自己教育的结果。
        “听话！”
    有的父母为了使孩子听话，竭力在孩子面前造成“只有自己最正确”的印象。我曾见到这样一位母亲，经常背后问孩子：“你喜欢爸爸还是喜欢妈妈？”孩子慢慢地学会了讨好，抱住妈妈的腿说：“我喜欢您”。这位母亲对孩子溺爱极了。有时，孩子犯了错误，别人谁也不能说，不能管。如果爸爸对孩子的错误行为进行了批评或责罚，妈妈就在一旁袒护，随便改变或取消爸爸的决定。等到孩子连自己的话都不听的时候，她又怒发冲冠，举手就打、张口就骂，“为什么不听我的话？”
    仅仅为了维持个人的威信而随便破坏家庭中一致的教育，不注意教育效果，甚至采取打骂的办法，这对孩子是非常有害的。这样建立起来的威信也是假威信。结果使得孩子不知道究竟怎样才是对或不对，以致使孩子谁的话也不听。在这些父母看来，好像让孩子服从的不是真理，而是个人。我们教育儿童听话，是为了实现道德教育的任务，并不是教他盲从。如果不管是非，只是要求孩子“听话！听话！”对孩子是没有什么教育意义的。
        娇惯的结果
    毛毛，是独生子，家里人都很喜欢他，孩子要什么，就买什么。妈妈下班回家不是给带点糖果来，就是买点什么小玩意。因此，一回家，孩子就拉住妈妈的手提包，“妈妈，你又给我买什么啦？”如果什么也没买，他就不高兴，甚至会大哭大叫撒起泼来。祖母在一旁和解说，“不哭，不哭，明天再让妈妈给你买。”妈妈只好答应这个要求。
    每一位父母都是爱孩子的，但是，不能娇惯，也不能单纯用满足孩子的某些物质欲望来换取孩子们的高兴。这样做的结果，就使小孩子认为父母满足他的不合理的要求是理所当然的事。更坏的后果是，养成了孩子任性、撒娇、不听话的习惯。
      再哭，什么也不给你买！
    星期天，父亲给孩子买了盒积木。小孩子一玩起来，什么都忘了，妈妈叫他吃午饭他都不肯吃。母亲不了解孩子这种心情，生起气来，骂他不听话，气冲冲地把积木从他手中夺过去，硬拉他到饭桌前去吃饭。孩子哭起来。妈妈大声吵着：“再哭，什么也不给你买！”
    让孩子带着眼泪去吃饭，对孩子的健康来说是不好的，更重要的是应该了解孩子，教育孩子。如果事先提醒他，快吃饭了，把积木收拾起来，吃过饭以后再玩。如果心平气和地给他这样说，孩子会乐意听从的。用物质引诱教孩子听话，并不能达到教育孩子的结果。
      说了就要做到
    爸爸妈妈给孩子新立了一条规矩，“吃饭前要洗手”。这样做了两天，到第三天头上，小孩子吃饭前没洗手，妈妈就不再注意了。有一天，小孩子没洗手又去吃饭了，妈妈这才开了口，“要吃饭，先洗手，我给你说过多少次了，为什么老不听说！”
    这时，孩子对妈妈的话就打了问号，前几天吃饭前没洗手，妈妈为什么就没管？说了不做，或做了不做到底，是儿童教育工作中的致命伤，也是父母最容易丧失威信的地方。有经验的父母提出吃饭前要洗手之后，就要让孩子做到。如果吃饭前没洗手，就让他洗了手再吃。这样不仅可以养成儿童爱清洁的习惯，更重要的是引起儿童对妈妈的话的重视，养成听话与服从的习惯。
    孩子对于父母的言语和行为是非常敏感而且要求严格的。当小孩子不听话的时候，应该认真研究一下小孩子为什么不听话，然后对症下药。同时，我还想说：如果想教育孩子听话，那就必须正确地培养父母的威信，因为孩子所敬爱与服从的，只是在自己心目中有威信的人。
