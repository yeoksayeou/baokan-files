Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, French Secretary of State for Information, Claparede, announced on the 15th, after an emergency meeting of the French Cabinet, that France is prepared to accept US mediation between France and Tunisia to resume Franco-Tunisian negotiations, but France does not accept US "arbitration."

　　The French Cabinet also decided to compensate the victims of the Sakiet bombing and instructed the French Red Cross to contact Tunisian Red Cross personnel to determine the total amount of losses. According to a French government spokesman, the French authorities are also considering withdrawing French troops stationed in Tunisia from isolated strongholds.

　　These measures by the French government were taken after US Ambassador to France, Houghton, consulted with French Prime Minister Gaillard. After these measures were announced, Washington officials immediately expressed "relief" and "encouragement." An Associated Press report noted with satisfaction that France's decision to accept US mediation meant that US diplomats in Tunisia, Paris, the United Nations in New York, and Washington would act as "intermediaries" for negotiations between France and Tunisia, which would "greatly increase US responsibility in North Africa."

　　It is reported that the United States is eager to achieve "reconciliation" between France and Tunisia before the Security Council meets on the 18th to discuss the Sakiet incident, in order to avoid such a "embarrassing" discussion in the United Nations for Western countries.

　　The day after the French government announced its acceptance of mediation, Tunisian President Bourguiba said that he was willing to accept US "mediation" regarding the French bombing of the village of Sakiet, if France also expressed its acceptance of such mediation. On the same day, Tunisian Foreign Minister Sadok Mokaddem also stated that if the United States formally proposed a "mediation" proposal, Tunisia would request the United Nations Security Council to postpone the discussion of Tunisia's complaint on this issue, originally scheduled for the 18th. At the same time, Bourguiba stated that Tunisia would continue to maintain "pressure" on the French troops stationed in Tunisia until France formally accepted the principle of complete withdrawal and began negotiating a withdrawal agreement. If France refuses to withdraw its troops, Tunisia will also request the United Nations Security Council to intervene.

　　Bourguiba said that he hoped to obtain military and financial "aid" from the United States and Britain to replace the "aid" originally from France.

　　The Rome "Il Tempo" published an interview with Tunisian President Bourguiba by the newspaper's reporter on the 15th, which welcomed the "intervention" of the United States and other Western countries in the Franco-Tunisian dispute. Bourguiba said that Tunisia advocates Algerian independence and the establishment of a "federation of Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco closely united with the Western world."

　　Bourguiba stated that "the Tunisian government completely stands on" the side of Western countries and may consider joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said that he hoped that Italy, together with the United States and NATO, would "intervene" to eliminate "the most serious danger hidden in the current situation" after the French bombing of Sakiet.

### 法突两国愿接受美国“斡旋”  美国坐收渔利沾沾自喜

    法突两国愿接受美国“斡旋”
    美国坐收渔利沾沾自喜
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：法国政府情报次长克拉帕雷德15日在法国内阁举行紧急会议以后宣布：法国准备接受美国在法国和突尼斯之间进行斡旋以恢复法突之间的谈判，但是，法国不接受美国的“仲裁”。
    法国内阁同时决定赔偿萨基埃特死难者的损失，并且指示法国红十字会同突尼斯红十字会人员接触和确定损失的总数。据法国政府发言人说，法国当局也正在考虑把驻在突尼斯的法国军队从孤立的据点撤退。
    法国政府这些措施是在美国驻法大使霍顿同法国总理盖伊阿商谈后采取的。在宣布这些措施以后，华盛顿人士立即表示“欣慰”和“鼓舞”。合众社消息满意地指出，法国接受美国斡旋的决定意味着美国在突尼斯、巴黎、纽约联合国和华盛顿的外交官员将充任使法突双方进行谈判的“中间人”，这就“大大增加了美国在北非的责任”。
    据报道，美国迫切希望在18日安全理事会开会讨论萨基埃特事件的日期以前能够使法国和突尼斯得到“和解”，以避免在联合国中举行这种使西方国家“难堪的”讨论。
    在法国政府宣布接受斡旋的第二天，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴说，关于法国轰炸萨基埃特村的事件，他愿意接受美国的“斡旋”，如果法国也表示接受这种斡旋的话。同一天，突尼斯外交部长萨克多·莫卡德姆还表示如果美国正式提出“斡旋”的建议，突尼斯将要求联合国安全理事会推迟原订于18日举行的对突尼斯就这个问题提出的控诉案的讨论。同时，布尔吉巴表示，突尼斯将继续对驻在突尼斯的法国军队保持“压力”，直到法国正式接受全面撤退的原则以及开始谈判一项撤退协议为止。如果法国拒绝撤退军队，突尼斯还将要求联合国安全理事会予以干涉。
    布尔吉巴说，他希望从美国和英国获得军事和财政“援助”来代替原来来自法国的“援助”。
    罗马“时代报”15日发表了突尼斯总统布尔吉巴对该报记者的谈话，这篇谈话欢迎美国和其他西方国家“干预”法突争端。布尔吉巴说，突尼斯主张阿尔及利亚独立，并且成立“同西方世界紧密联合的阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥联邦”。
    布尔吉巴表示“突尼斯政府完全站在”西方国家这一边，并且可能考虑参加北大西洋集团。他说，他希望意大利同美国和北大西洋公约组织一道进行“干预”，以消除法国轰炸萨基埃特以后“目前局势中包藏着的最严重的危险”。
