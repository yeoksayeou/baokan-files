    Who Wrote "Black Clouds Overwhelm the City, the City Seems About to Crumble"?
    Jiuquan
    In the July 1st editorial of the "People's Daily" last year, "The Bourgeois Direction of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized," it was mentioned that the Journalists Association held two meetings at that time. "At the first meeting, black clouds overwhelmed the city, and the city seemed about to crumble, displaying a reactionary bourgeois news line. The atmosphere at the second meeting held recently has changed. The rightists are still stubbornly resisting, but most people have a correct direction..." The vivid phrase "black clouds overwhelm the city, the city seems about to crumble," used to describe the situation, is originally an ancient poem. Who wrote it?
    It is the opening line of the Yuefu poem "Yanmen Border Garrison Song" by the mid-Tang poet Li He (courtesy name Changji). The next line is "Armor gleams towards the sun, golden scales unfold." It is said that the young Li Changji, who was not yet famous at the time, was initially appreciated by Han Yu because of these two lines of poetry. One summer afternoon, Han Yu was taking a nap when Li He brought his works to see him. Han Yu was just about to instruct the doorman to dismiss the visitor, but when he opened the scroll and read "Yanmen Border Garrison Song," he found it so outstanding that he hurriedly put on his belt and got up to meet the author.
    Another story is that Changji could write poetry and prose at the age of seven, which spread throughout the capital. Han Yu and Huangfu Shi heard about it but didn't believe it, so they went to Li's house to see the child. Li He immediately picked up a pen and wrote a poem called "High Carriage Passes," which greatly surprised the two men. From then on, Li He became famous. However, it is said that this story is an embellishment, because it is estimated that Li He was already an adult at that time.
    But in any case, Han Yu did appreciate Li Changji very much. Those who have read Han Yu's famous "Defense Against Taboo" in "Guan Zhi of Ancient Prose" will surely remember that the name of this young poet appears at the beginning of the article, and that this article was written specifically for Li He. At that time, there was a popular etiquette of taboo. Those who were jealous of Li He insisted that Li He's father's name was Jin Su, so he could not take the imperial examination, because "Jin" (晋) was homophonous with "Jin" (进, meaning advance). Han Yu's article greatly satirized those people, saying, "Does it mean that if a father's name is 'Ren' (仁, meaning benevolence), his son cannot even be a person?"
    Even the two lines of poetry, "black clouds overwhelm the city," were ridiculed by authoritative figures like Wang Anshi. He said: "This kid is mistaken. How can there be armor gleaming towards the sun when black clouds overwhelm the city?" Some versions even changed the word "sun" (日) to "moon" (月). Those who defended Li He said that the kind of weather described in the poem is common in the changing seasons. People often see the sky suddenly filled with black clouds, and then the black clouds crack, revealing sunlight. Wang Anshi's statement was clearly nitpicking.
    Li Changji was dissatisfied with the current situation. His circumstances were very bad, and he suffered a lot of exclusion and setbacks. He died at the young age of twenty-seven. However, his Yuefu poems were very popular at the time. Later, some critics praised his poems as having reversed the declining poetic style of the time and inherited Qu Yuan's noble tradition, just like Han Yu's prose. Du Mu praised his poems in this way: "Clouds and mist are not enough to describe their state, the vastness of the water is not enough to describe their emotion, the exuberance of spring is not enough to describe their harmony, the clarity of autumn is not enough to describe their style, the wind-driven masts and battle formations are not enough to describe their courage, the tile coffins and inscribed tripods are not enough to describe their antiquity, the seasonal flowers and beautiful women are not enough to describe their color, the desolate countries and ruined palaces, the overgrown mounds are not enough to describe their resentment and sorrow, the whale sucking and turtle throwing, the monsters and spirits are not enough to describe their illusion and absurdity." But some critics disliked his works for being strange and obscure, incomprehensible, and even scolded his poems for being full of ridicule and indignant emotions, which obviously did not conform to the "hygiene" of writing and deserved his early death. From these different praises and criticisms, we can also see Li Changji's style.

    “黑云压城城欲摧”是谁的诗？
    酒泉
    去年7月1日“人民日报”社论“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”中，谈到那时新闻工作者协会开了两次会，“第一次黑云压城城欲摧，摆出了反动的资产阶级新闻路线。近日开的第二次会，空气变了，右派仍然顽抗，多数人算是有了正确方向。……”这里形容时局的那句生动的话“黑云压城城欲摧”，原是一句古诗。是谁写的呢？
    这是中唐诗人李贺（字长吉）所作乐府“雁门太守行”的开头一句。下句是
  “甲光向日金麟开”。据说，当时还没有出名的年轻的李长吉，就因为这两句诗而受到了韩愈的最初的赏识。一个暑天，韩愈正睡午觉，李贺带了自己的作品求见，韩愈刚要吩咐看门人打发来客走，可是一打开诗卷，读到“雁门太守行”，觉得非常突出，就匆忙束带起床，召见作者。
    另一个传说是长吉七岁就能诗文，传遍了京城，韩愈和皇甫湜听了不信，特地到李家去看这孩子。李贺当场提笔就写了一首“高轩过”，二人大惊。从此李贺就出了名。但是，据说这个故事是附会的，因为估计那时李贺已经成年了。
    但是，不管怎样，韩愈确实是很赏识李长吉的。读过“古文观止”里的那篇韩愈的著名的“讳辩”的人，一定记得，文章开头就有这位青年诗人的名字，而且这篇文章是专门为李贺写的。当时流行一种忌讳的礼法。妒忌李贺的人们硬说李贺的父亲名晋肃，所以不能考进士，因为“晋”和“进”同音。韩愈的文章把那批人大大讽刺了一通，他说难道父亲名“仁”，儿子连人都不能做了吗？
    就是“黑云压城”那两行诗，也受到像王安石那样的权威人士的讥刺。他说：“这小子弄错了，在黑云压城的时候，怎么能够有向日的甲光呢？”甚至有的本子把“日”字改做“月”字。为李贺辩护的人们说，诗中所描写的那种气象在忽阴忽晴的季节里是常有的。人们常看到天空一忽儿满布黑云，一忽儿黑云裂缝，日光透露。王安石的说法分明是吹毛求疵罢了。
    李长吉不满时势，他的遭遇很坏，饱受排挤打击，只活了二十七岁就死了。但是他的乐府在当时演唱极盛。后来有的评论家推崇他的诗和韩愈的散文一样，扭转了当时衰颓的诗风，承继了屈原的高贵传统。杜牧这样称赞他的诗：“云烟绵联不足为其态也，水之迢迢不足为其情也，春之盎盎不足为其和也，秋之明洁不足为其格也，风樯阵马不足为其勇也，瓦棺篆鼎不足为其古也，时花美女不足为其色也，荒国陊殿、梗莽丘垅不足为其怨恨悲愁也，鲸吸鳌掷、牛鬼蛇神不足为其虚荒诞幻也。”但是也有的评论家嫌他的作品古怪晦涩、不可理解，甚至骂他诗中充满了嘲弄悲愤的感情，显然不合“卫生”之道，活该早死。从这些褒贬不同的话里也可以看出李长吉的风格了。
