Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th -- At a press conference held this afternoon at the Presidential Palace in India, President Ho Chi Minh, when answering a question about the reunification of Vietnam, said: "Our position is very clear and unchangeable, that is: in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, Vietnam should be reunified peacefully on the basis of independence and democracy. We are ready to consult with the South Vietnamese authorities to discuss the holding of free nationwide elections to reunify our country."

President Ho Chi Minh also pointed out that "the South Vietnamese authorities, at the instigation of foreign countries, have rejected our proposal to hold consultations and discussions on elections in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Even the proposal to restore normal relations between the two regions has not yet received any response from the South Vietnamese authorities." He said, "We believe that representatives of the two regions should meet and discuss like brothers, without giving the imperialists any opportunity to interfere; if this is done, the reunification of the motherland will definitely be achieved. Now, the most urgent thing is to restore normal relations between the North and South so that free economic and cultural exchanges between the people become possible."

He praised India's efforts in implementing the Geneva Accords and said: "We hope the International Commission will continue its efforts."

President Ho Chi Minh warmly welcomed the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a treaty of non-aggression and hold a summit conference.

He condemned the aggressive bloc of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and said: "The practice of including South Vietnam within the scope of protection of this aggressive bloc blatantly violates the Geneva Accords." He added: "The conspiracy to closely link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization bloc has aggravated international tensions," and peace-loving people of all countries firmly oppose this conspiracy.

When referring to the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for independence, he said: "We are determined to stand with the people of Asia and Africa and resolutely carry out the struggle against colonialism." He said: "The Algerian war should be stopped, and the Algerian people's desire for independence should be respected." He also said: "Goa should be returned to India, and West Irian and Taiwan should be returned to Indonesia and the People's Republic of China respectively."

President Ho Chi Minh explained the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of establishing friendly relations and conducting trade with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He particularly emphasized the good-neighborly relations maintained with Cambodia and Laos based on "Panchsheel."

Ho Chi Minh answered more than a dozen questions raised by a reporter from the American "Los Angeles Times" in a very humorous and straightforward manner. He strongly refuted the assertion that free elections could not be held in Vietnam. He said: "Elections have not yet been held there, how can people say that elections will not be free?" He added: "We guarantee that the elections will be absolutely free."

When answering a question about Vietnam's attitude towards the United States, he said that the Vietnamese people regard the American people as friends and brothers, but they do not like the US government's policy of obstructing the reunification of Vietnam.

A reporter asked him if he had ever asked the United States to supply weapons when fighting the French colonists. President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The United States supplied the French with many weapons, and we obtained them from the French during the war. Therefore, they indirectly supplied us with weapons."

He also said that Vietnam is prepared to accept economic assistance from any country, "as long as there are no military or political conditions attached, and no interference in our internal affairs."

He also talked about national construction and development in Vietnam after the restoration of peace, and about the good impressions gained during this visit to India.

Many Indian reporters and reporters from other countries attended the reception. President Ho Chi Minh's answers elicited a strong reaction. When the reception ended, the reporters applauded warmly.

　　胡志明在德里记者招待会上说
    越南应当实现和平统一
    愿同南越协商举行自由普选等问题
    新华社新德里7日电　胡志明主席今天下午在印度总统府举行的记者招待会上，回答关于越南重新统一的问题时说：“我们的立场是非常明确的、不可更改的，这就是：按照日内瓦协议的规定，通过和平方法在独立和民主的基础上重新统一越南。我们已经准备同南越当局进行协商，讨论举行全国自由普选以重新统一我国的问题。”
    胡志明主席还指出，“南越当局在外国教唆下拒绝了我们提出的关于按照日内瓦协议的规定举行协商讨论普选问题的建议。甚至关于恢复两个地区正常关系的建议，南越当局也还没有作任何答复。”他说：“我们认为，两个地区的代表应该像兄弟一样地会见和商谈，不要给帝国主义者任何机会来进行干涉；如果这样做的话，那就一定会实现祖国的重新统一。现在，最迫切的事情是恢复南北方之间的正常关系，以使人民之间的自由的经济和文化交流成为可能。”
    他称赞印度在执行日内瓦协议方面的努力，并且说：“我们希望国际委员会继续努力。”
    胡志明主席表示热烈欢迎苏联政府所提出的关于缔结互不侵犯条约和举行最高级会议的建议。
    他谴责东南亚条约组织侵略集团，并且说：“把南越划入这个侵略集团的保护范围的做法彰明昭著地违反了日内瓦协议”。他又说：“企图把北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约这两个集团同东南亚条约组织集团密切联系起来的阴谋，加剧了国际紧张局势”，爱好和平的各国人民坚决反对这种阴谋。
    他在提到亚非两洲各国人民争取独立的斗争时说：“我们决心同亚非人民站在一起，坚决进行反对殖民主义的斗争。”他说：“阿尔及利亚战争应该停止，阿尔及利亚人民的独立愿望应该得到尊重。”他又说：“果阿应该归还印度，同时西伊里安和台湾也应该分别归还印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国。”
    胡志明主席解释了越南民主共和国所执行的根据和平共处五项原则同一切国家建立友好关系和进行贸易的和平外交政策。他特别着重地谈到根据“潘查希拉”同柬埔寨和老挝所保持的善邻关系。
    胡志明很有风趣而又直率地回答了美国“洛杉矶时报”记者所提出的十几个问题。他强烈地驳斥了硬说在越南无法举行自由选举的那种说法。他说：“那里还没有举行选举，人们怎么能够说选举不会是自由的呢？”他又说：“我们保证，选举将是绝对自由的。”
    他在答复关于越南对美国的态度的问题时说，越南人民把美国人民看作朋友和兄弟，但是他们不喜欢美国政府的阻挠越南重新统一的政策。
    有记者问他，在和法国殖民者作战的时候，是否曾经要求美国供应武器。胡志明主席指出：“美国供给法国人许多武器，我们是在战争中从法国人那里得到的。因此，他们间接地供给了我们武器。”
    他还说，越南准备接受任何国家的经济援助，“只要不附有任何军事的或政治的条件，和不干涉我国内政”。
    他还谈到越南在恢复和平之后的国家建设和发展，并且谈到这次访问印度获得的良好印象。
    参加这次招待会的有很多印度记者和其他国家的记者。胡志明主席的回答博得了强烈的反应。当招待会结束时，记者们报以热烈的掌声。
