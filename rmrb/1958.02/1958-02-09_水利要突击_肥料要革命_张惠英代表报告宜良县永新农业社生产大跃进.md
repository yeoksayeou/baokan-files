“Water Conservancy Must be a Blitz, Fertilizer Must be a Revolution”
Delegate Zhang Huiying Reports on the Production Great Leap Forward of Yongxin Agricultural Cooperative in Yiliang County

I am an ordinary farmer from the Yongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yiliang County, Yunnan. Recalling last year, around June and July, when we were here attending the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, it was precisely the time when the people of the whole country were engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the right-wing elements. Before and after this, the landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries in the countryside also launched counterattacks, settling scores, and conspiracies of rumors and sabotage against the peasants. We peasants were extremely angry at the conspiracies of the right-wing elements and landlords and rich peasants. Under the wise leadership of the Party, we defeated the right-wing elements and landlords and rich peasants, dealt with hidden counter-revolutionaries, and achieved great victories.

After we thoroughly defeated the enemy, we then launched a major debate centered on grain. Through the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and meticulous accounting, the awareness of the members was greatly enhanced, their eyes were brighter, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. Before the major debate, the attendance rate of our Yongxin Cooperative was 50%; after the major debate, the attendance rate reached over 90%. In the past, cooperative cadres who lacked confidence now also pledged to share weal and woe with the members and work for a lifetime.

Fellow delegates, this is a great victory we have achieved on the political and ideological front under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Now, all the members of our cooperative, like our peasant brothers across the country, are brimming with confidence, full of revolutionary vigor, and have entered a production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. We have put forward the slogan of "Water conservancy must be a blitz, fertilizer must be a revolution, production must be a Great Leap Forward."

　　Mobilizing the Masses to Use Their Brains and Find Eighteen Kinds of Fertilizer Sources

In the past, our cooperative had very few sources of fertilizer, and we didn't think of many methods. We only knew how to use pig manure, cattle and horse manure, and old wall soil. However, after the socialist great debate, the leading cadres of the cooperative and the Party and League organizations jointly discussed and studied, mobilized the masses to use their brains and think of ways, and finally found eighteen kinds of fertilizer sources. Using the method of combining the hygiene movement with the fertilizer accumulation movement, we established a guidance group and youth shock brigade, and launched a hygiene evaluation movement throughout the cooperative, proposing to achieve "Livestock must have pens, every household must have a toilet, toilets must be covered, everyone must diligently accumulate fertilizer, and there must be no excrement on the road." Because cooperative cadres took the lead actively and the cooperative provided material support to the members, the members' enthusiasm was even higher, and a high tide of raising pigs, renovating pigsties, and accumulating fertilizer quickly emerged. Everyone engaged in production during the day and renovated pigsties at night. In just over three days, more than 500 old pigsties were renovated into new ones. The new pigsties were padded with stones, sprinkled with lime, dry, and clean. This not only increased the amount of pig manure accumulated, but also greatly reduced the mortality rate of pigs. In the past, each pig only stepped on 50 loads of fertilizer; now, each pig steps on 110 loads. The members all call the pigsties "fertilizer warehouses." Some members even put forward competitive slogans such as "If you want crops to look good, carry the manure basket on your shoulders" and "Compare manure piles in winter, compare grain piles in autumn." After the movement was launched, the whole cooperative, regardless of men, women, old, or young, accumulated green manure, shoveled cinder soil, swept chimneys, dug old wall soil, dredged ditch mud, collected stray hair, pig bristles, and scrap leather, accumulated urine, and cleaned houses and street hygiene. It truly formed the habit that every family had a urine pot and everyone carried a urine jug. The Duan Jiayou family in our cooperative, with nine people, accumulated urine worth 70 yuan in one year, which could buy nine bolts of cloth, enough for the whole family to wear for a year. The youth shock brigade worked even harder, digging saltpeter soil in the mountains day and night. Twenty-six people dug 10,000 jin in a week. This saltpeter soil, mixed with hair and pig bristles, solved the fertilizer problem for the whole cooperative's rice seedling fields. In addition, we also dug more than 300,000 loads of ditch mud. If the ditch mud is piled together with pig manure and covered with mud, after 20 days of decomposition, its quality is equivalent to animal manure. After we dug the old wall soil, we also replaced it with new walls for the members, demolished their thatched houses that had been used for many years to make fertilizer, and built tiled houses for them. No one was not grateful. Everyone got up before dawn and cleaned the streets and courtyards. In this way, we not only accumulated fertilizer, but also made the places that were not clean in the past tidy and clean. Up to now, the whole cooperative has accumulated a total of 323,900 jin of fertilizer, and we plan to apply 7,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of paddy field and 5,000 jin per mu of dry land, an increase of 40% compared to 1957. Xu Jiabin, a 78-year-old member, said: "I have lived such a long life, and I have never seen such great enthusiasm. This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

　　The Whole Cooperative is Divided into Teams to Build Water Conservancy, Striving to be the First to Seize the Red Flag

Let me talk about the water conservancy of our cooperative. There is a river in Yiliang County called Jialong River. The water level is low, and it is not easy to draw water up. Everywhere there are river bends and beaches, wasting a lot of land. The river embankment is also very low. Whenever there is a flood, the fields and farmers on both sides of the river often suffer. After the Forty Articles of the Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program were announced, under the leadership of the Party committee, while carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement, we launched a discussion on large-scale water conservancy construction. The members realized that to achieve a Great Leap Forward in production, we must grasp the two keys of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. Everyone embraced the ambition to "make the high mountains bow their heads and the river water make way" and unanimously proposed: "We must change pulling water into paddy fields to letting water into paddy fields, change beaches into paddy fields, change winding rivers into straight rivers, dig high water levels and river embankments, turn water disasters into water conservancy, and change river embankments into oil crop areas." The whole cooperative organized three teams: the youth shock brigade, the women's shock brigade, and the outstanding model shock brigade, and also made outstanding red flags. Regardless of day or night, everyone felt like they were on the battlefield when they arrived at the construction site. Everyone was brave and took the lead. The outstanding red flag was constantly fluttering back and forth in the teams. You snatched it, I took it. The enthusiasm was getting higher and higher. Men, women, old, and young, everyone strove to be the first, it was really a scene of shouting, neighing, and bustling activity. The entire project only took more than 20 days of work to raise the river embankment by several zhang, and the task was completed in a blitz. It only cost a total of 900 yuan, expanded the cultivated area by 270 mu, and dug ten ditches in another seven days. The elderly members said: "In the old society, the peasants gave them (referring to the Kuomintang rulers) hundreds of pigs, cattle, and sheep, but they could not build this river. Only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, can we spend so little money to do such a big thing and plant power poles in front of our homes. It is really the Communist Party that has brightened the eyes of the peasants. We must take the road of socialism." For many years, whenever there was a flood, the peasants dared not sleep and got up in the middle of the night to sit guard, fearing that the flood would wash away their houses and crops. But now, everyone can sleep peacefully.

　　A New Atmosphere of Diligence and Thrift, Setting Targets for Increased Grain Production

Fellow delegates, before liberation, this area of ours in Yunnan could be considered fertile land, and the harvest was not bad, but more than 70% of the people here lacked food and clothing and spent the whole year working for the landlords. Only when the Communist Party came did we truly become the masters of our own land. Since the establishment of the cooperative in 1953 until the transition to the advanced cooperative in 1955, our cooperative has grown from 18 households to 844 households, with increased production every year. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu of the whole cooperative was 910 jin, an increase of 60.4% compared to 550 jin per mu before liberation. The highest yield reached 1,310 jin. There are no longer any grain-deficient households in our cooperative. The average income per household is 400 yuan, and the household with the highest income reaches more than 800 yuan. Xie Jiangguang's production team in our cooperative, before liberation, a family of nine shared a broken cotton quilt and lived in a dilapidated house, and had not worn cotton clothes for three generations. Now, a family of eleven people all wear cotton clothes. They have built two new tiled houses, and have everything including cotton quilts and hot water bottles.

During the production upsurge, a new atmosphere of diligence and thrift emerged in our cooperative. Our cooperative criticized the phenomenon of waste during the rectification campaign and responded to the central government's call to practice diligence and thrift. The whole cooperative's atmosphere has undergone a great change. Everyone is hardworking, simple, and strives to produce.

Fellow delegates, only under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao can we peasants have the happy life we have today, and only then can our work achieve such results. Since the National Agricultural Development Program pointed out a clear vision for us, we feel that what we have achieved is still far from our great goal, and we still need to catch up faster. Therefore, our cooperative has proposed that the production target for 1958 is to achieve an average yield of 1,110 jin per mu. We have the determination and confidence to achieve this target, and we are determined to muster revolutionary vigor and resolutely strive to achieve a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and build a new socialist countryside.

### “水利要突击　肥料要革命”  张惠英代表报告宜良县永新农业社生产大跃进

　　“水利要突击　肥料要革命”
    张惠英代表报告宜良县永新农业社生产大跃进
    我是云南宜良县永新农业生产合作社的一个普通的农民。回想起去年六、七月间，我们在这里参加第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议的时候，那正是全国人民和右派分子进行你死我活的斗争的时候，在这前后，农村的地富、反革命分子也向农民展开了反攻、倒算和造谣破坏的阴谋活动。我们农民对右派分子和地主富农的阴谋，十分愤怒。在党的英明领导下，我们斗垮了右派和地主富农，处理了暗藏的反革命分子，取得巨大的胜利。
    我们把敌人彻底地斗垮以后，接着展开以粮食为中心的大辩论，通过摆事实、讲道理、算细账的办法，社员们的觉悟大大提高了，眼睛更亮了，生产热情空前高涨。大辩论以前，我们永新社全社出勤率是百分之五十，大辩论以后出勤率达到百分之九十以上。过去信心不足的社干部，现在也提出决心和社员同甘共苦，干一辈子。
    各位代表，这是我们在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在政治思想战线上取得的一次伟大的胜利。现在我们社的全体社员也正和全国的农民弟兄一样，信心百倍地鼓足了革命的干劲，进入了以兴修水利和积肥运动为中心的生产高潮，提出了“水利要突击，肥料要革命，生产要大跃进”的口号。
　　发动群众动脑筋　找到肥源十八种
    过去，我们社的肥料来源是很少的，想的办法也不多，只知道用猪粪、牛、马粪和老墙土等，但是，在社会主义大辩论以后，合作社的领导干部和党团组织共同进行了讨论、研究，发动群众动脑筋、想办法，终于找出了十八种肥源，用卫生运动和积肥运动相结合的办法，成立了指导小组和青年突击队，在全社展开了卫生评比运动，提出要做到“牲畜要有厩，家家有厕所，厕所要加盖，人人勤积肥，路上无粪便”。由于社干积极带头和合作社对社员的物质上的支持，社员们的积极性更高了，很快的掀起了养猪改厩积肥高潮，大家白天搞生产，晚上改猪厩，三天多旧厩改新厩五百多个。新的猪圈垫上石头、洒上石灰，又干燥，又清洁，这样不光是积的猪粪多，猪的死亡率也大大减少了。过去每头猪只踩五十挑肥，现在一头猪要踩一百一十挑，社员们都把猪圈叫做“肥料仓库”。还有些社员提出：“要想庄稼像个样，粪箕要挂在肩膀上”、“冬季比粪堆，秋季比谷堆”的竞赛口号。运动展开以后，全社不分男女老少，个个积绿肥，铲火土、扫烟筒、挖老墙土、挖沟泥、搜集乱头发、猪毛和碎皮，积小便，打扫房屋和街头卫生，真正形成了家家有尿盆，人人带尿罐的习惯，我们社段家友家九口人，一年积存的尿就值七十元，可以买九个布，够一家人穿一年；青年突击队就干得更起劲儿了，他们白天黑夜到山上去挖硝土，二十六个人一星期挖了一万斤，这些硝土和头发、猪毛掺合起来，解决了全社的秧田肥料；另外，我们还挖了三十多万挑沟泥，如果把沟泥和猪粪堆在一起，外面糊上泥巴，经过二十天的腐烂，它的质量就相当于畜粪；我们在挖了老墙土以后，还给社员换上新墙，拆掉他们多年的草房做肥料，给他们盖上瓦房，没有一个人不感激的。大家天不亮就起来，把街道、房院打扫得干干净净的，这样，既做到了积肥，又使得过去不干净的地方变得整齐清洁了，到现在为止，全社一共积肥三十二万三千九百斤，计划每亩水田施肥七千斤，旱地每亩五千斤，比一九五七年增加了百分之四十。七十八岁的社员徐家宾说：“我活了这样大年纪，从来没有见过这样的干劲大，这都是共产党和毛主席领导得好。”
　　全社分队兴水利　奋勇争先夺红旗
    再说，我们社的水利。宜良县有条河叫贾龙河，水位低，水不容易拉上来，处处都是河湾和沙滩，土地浪费很大，河堤也很低，洪水一来，两岸田亩和农民经常受灾。农业发展纲要修正草案四十条公布以后，我们社在党委的领导下，在搞积肥运动的同时，展开了大兴水利的讨论，社员们认识到，要做到生产大跃进，必须抓住兴修水利和积肥这两个关键，大家都抱着“要让高山低头，河水让路”的雄心，一致提出：“要改拉水田为放水田，改沙滩为水田，改弯河为直河，挖高水位和河堤，变水灾为水利，改河堤为油料作物区。”全社组织了三个队：青年突击队，妇女突击队，优秀模范突击队，还制做了优秀红旗。不管白天黑夜，大家一到工地就好比上了战场，人人奋勇，个个当先，优胜红旗来回在各队里翻腾，你抢来，我夺去的。劲头越来越足，男女老少，个个争先恐后，真是人喊马叫热火朝天，整个工程只花了二十多日的工夫河堤挑了几丈高，任务也就突击完了。总共只花了九百块钱，扩大了耕地面积二百七十亩，另外七天挖了十条沟。年老的社员们说：“在旧社会，农民把猪、牛、羊给他们（指国民党统治者们）几百只也修不成这条河，只有今天在共产党的领导下，才能花这样少的钱办这样大的事，还把电线杆栽到家门前来，这真是共产党把农民的眼睛照亮了，我们一定要走社会主义的路。”多少年来，每到涨洪水，农民不敢睡觉，半夜起来坐守着，怕洪水把房屋和庄稼冲跑了，现在呢？大家都可以安心的熟睡了。
　　勤俭节约新气象　定出指标多产粮
    各位代表，解放以前，我们这个地区在云南来说，土地也算是肥沃的，收成也不坏，但是这里的老百姓百分之七十以上是缺吃少穿，整年为着地主奔命。共产党来了，我们才算真正做了自己土地的主人。自从一九五三年建社以来，到一九五五年转高级社为止，我们社由十八户发展到八百四十四户，年年增产，一九五七年全社每亩平均产粮九百一十斤，比解放前每亩五百五十斤，增产百分之六十点四，产量最高的达到一千三百一十斤。我们社现在已经没有缺粮户了，每户平均收入是四百元，收入最多的户达到八百多元。我们社的生产队里谢俭光，在解放前一家九口人合盖一床破棉被，住一间破房子，三辈子没穿过棉衣。现在一家十一口人全穿上棉衣了。盖了两间新瓦房，棉被、热水壶样样都全。
    在生产高潮当中，我们社还出现了勤俭节约的新气象。我们社在整社中批评了浪费现象，响应中央号召实行勤俭节约。全社的风气，来了个大转变。大家艰苦朴素，努力生产。
    各位代表，只有在党和毛主席的正确的领导下，我们农民才有今天的幸福生活，我们的工作也才能得到这样的成绩。自从农业发展纲要给我们指出了明确的远景以后，我们感到我们所达到的离我们伟大的目标还很远，我们还需要加紧往前赶，因此，我们社提出一九五八年的生产指标是每亩平均产量达到一千一百一十斤。我们有决心，也有信心达到这个指标，决心鼓足革命的干劲，坚决为实现农业生产大跃进、建设社会主义的新农村而奋斗。
