Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: Iraq's King Faisal and his cousin, Jordan's King Hussein, announced on the 14th the formation of an "Arab Federation."

    The agreement signed by both parties stipulates that the King of Iraq will be the head of the federal government. However, both kings will retain their thrones within their respective countries.

    The agreement states that the federal government will be based in Baghdad and Amman alternately for a period of six months each. Federal affairs will be managed by a federal government composed of a legislative body and an administrative body. The parliaments of both countries will elect members of the federal legislative body in equal numbers. Members of the administrative body will be appointed in accordance with the federal constitution. The federation and the two member states will adopt a new unified flag, unify foreign policy and diplomatic representation, and unify armed forces and financial and economic policies.

    However, the agreement also stipulates: "Both countries will retain their respective international status, independence, and sovereignty over their current territories, and will retain their current ruling systems." "International treaties, conventions, and agreements that were binding on either country prior to the establishment of the federation will continue to be valid for the original contracting party, but will not be binding on the other member of the federation. All treaties, conventions, and agreements concluded after the declaration of the establishment of the federal state and related to the interests of the federation shall be governed by and subject to the authority of the federal government."

    The federal government will draft a federal constitution. Within three months from the date of this declaration, arrangements will be made to establish the federal government and stipulate the federal constitution.

    The agreement also declares that any other Arab country willing to join this federation may do so.

    Iraq is a member of the Baghdad Military Pact. Since Jordan's King Hussein dissolved the nationalist government last April under the direction of the United States, Iraq has been supporting the unstable rule of the Jordanian royal family.

    伊拉克和约旦结成“联邦”
    据新华社15日讯　伊拉克国王费萨尔和他的堂弟约旦国王侯赛因两国14日宣布结成一个“阿拉伯联邦”。
    双方签订的协定规定，伊拉克国王将是联邦政府的首脑。但是，两国国王都保留他们在国内的王位。
    协定说，联邦政府将以六个月为期，轮流以巴格达和安曼为其所在地。联邦事务将由一个由立法机构和行政机构组成的联邦政府管理。两国议会将按等同的数额选出联邦立法机构的成员。行政机构的成员将根据联邦宪法任命。联邦和两个成员国将采用新的统一的旗帜，将统一外交政策和外交代表，统一武装部队和财政经济政策。
    但是协定同时规定：“两国将保留各自的国际地位、独立和在目前领土上的主权，并且保留目前的执政系统。”“成立联邦以前已经对两国中任何一国发生约束力的国际条约、公约和协定将对原缔约国继续有效，但对联邦的另一成员国没有约束力。宣布成立联邦国家以后缔结的、并且关系到联邦利益的一切条约、公约和协定将受联邦政府的管辖并受其权力的支配。”
    联邦政府将起草一项联邦宪法。在这个宣言发表之日起的三个月内，将作出安排以建立联邦政府并规定联邦宪法。
    协定还宣称，愿意参加这个联邦的任何其他阿拉伯国家都可以参加。
    伊拉克是巴格达军事条约的成员国。去年4月约旦国王侯赛因在美国的指使下解散了民族主义政府以后，伊拉克一直在支持约旦王室的不稳定的统治。
