Half-Month Agricultural Situation
“Great Cold” (January 20) – “Start of Spring” (February 4)

    Preparing for spring plowing has become a widespread action in the vast rural areas. While vigorously constructing farmland irrigation and water conservancy projects, many regions are also actively preparing fertilizers for spring plowing. As a result, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in various places is increasing. By February 3, Shaanxi Province had accumulated more than 133 billion jin of fertilizer, reaching more than 83% of the province's winter fertilizer accumulation plan. Around the "Start of Spring," Hebei Province had accumulated more than 550 billion jin of fertilizer, reaching 86% of the original plan.

    Judging from some situations during this period, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in various places this year is generally more than last year, and the time for starting to deliver manure to the fields is also earlier. Some areas in the north began delivering manure to the fields as early as a month ago. By the end of January, the entire Inner Mongolia region had already delivered enough manure to fertilize more than 6.2 million mu of land, accounting for 11% of the fertilization plan.

    In order to meet the needs of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, many regions are actively collecting high-quality seeds of various crops from other places. Hebei Province has transferred more than 80 million jin of spring wheat seeds from other places. In order to solve the problem of a shortage of tens of millions of jin of early rice seeds in various places, Hubei Province has sent a large number of people to Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other seven provinces to purchase them.

    According to incomplete statistics from the agricultural department in early February, the amount of seeds transferred by various provinces this year far exceeds the amount transferred during the same period last year.

    In the south, the period between "Great Cold" and "Start of Spring" is the season for applying winter fertilizer to summer-ripening crops. Agricultural cooperatives in these areas are continuing to carry out this task while constructing irrigation and water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer. Many areas have also inspected the field management of summer-ripening crops, and have reversed the slow progress of production through inspections. Taking Jiangkou County in Guizhou Province as an example, more than 10,000 mu of "third-class rapeseed" were only fertilized and covered after inspection. More than 80% of these rescued rapeseed plants turned from yellow to green before the "Start of Spring."

    In the north, in order to meet the needs of wheat returning to green, many regions continue to apply urea fertilizer to wheat fields. Some areas in Hebei Province have made specific preparations for sowing spring wheat during this period.

    半月农情
    “大寒”（1月20日）——“立春”（2月4日）
    准备春耕已成为广大农村的普遍行动。许多地区在大力兴修农田水利的同时，还积极为春耕准备肥料。因此，各地积肥的数量都在增长中。陕西省到2月3日已积肥一千三百三十多亿斤，达到该省冬季积肥计划的83％以上。河北省到“立春”前后，已积肥料五千五百多亿斤，达到原计划的86％。
    从这个阶段的一些情况看，今年各地的积肥数量普遍比去年多，开始送粪的时间也较早。北方一些地区早在一个月以前就开始送粪上地。到1月底，内蒙古全区已送出可施六百二十多万亩地的粪肥，占施肥计划的11％。
    许多地区为了适应今年农业生产大跃进的需要，积极向外地筹集各种作物的优良种子。河北省由外地调入的春小麦种子就有八千多万斤。湖北省为了解决各地缺少几千万斤早稻种子的问题，已派出大批人员到四川、湖南、江西等七个省采购。
    根据农业部门2月初不完全统计，今年各省调运种子的数量，远远超过去年同一时期的调运量。
    在南方，“大寒”“立春”之间正是向夏熟作物田追施腊肥的季节。这些地区的农业社都在兴修水利和积肥的同时，继续进行这项事情。不少地区还检查了夏熟作物田间管理，并且通过检查扭转了生产进展迟缓的局面。以贵州省江口县为例，一万多亩“三类油菜”在检查以后才追施了肥料和加上覆盖。这些经过抢救的油菜到“立春”以前已有80％以上由黄转青。
    在北方，为了满足小麦返青的需要，许多地区继续向麦田追施尿肥。河北省一些地区在这个时期里已作好播种春小麦的具体准备。
