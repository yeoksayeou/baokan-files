Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: Major General Kang Sang-ho, the senior member of the Korean-Chinese side to the Korean Military Armistice Commission, today wrote to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, protesting the US side's introduction of atomic weapons into South Korea and the holding of provocative atomic assault exercises near the Demilitarized Zone.

The letter stated that on January 29, the United Nations Command officially announced that it had brought into South Korea atomic cannons with a caliber of 280 mm capable of firing atomic warheads. Prior to this, from January 20 to January 25, the United Nations Command held atomic assault exercises near the Demilitarized Zone, the largest-scale exercise since the Korean Armistice to test the attack power and mobility of the US military after being reorganized into an "atomic division." The letter pointed out that this provocative act is a continuation of the various criminal activities consistently carried out by the United Nations Command to undermine the armistice agreement since the Korean Armistice.

The letter stated that the United Nations Command is attempting to legalize its illegal actions by unilaterally declaring the abolition of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement on June 21, 1957. However, this action itself seriously violated the Armistice Agreement and is completely illegal and invalid. The United Nations Command's foolish argument that it is attempting to legalize its new acts of violating the Armistice Agreement in this way is completely untenable.

The letter pointed out: No sophistry on the part of the United Nations Command can conceal the fact that its series of serious destructive activities, such as transporting atomic weapons into South Korea and holding provocative atomic assault exercises near the Demilitarized Zone, are actively preparing for atomic war in the Far East and turning South Korea into a US atomic war base and a hotbed of atomic war.

The letter emphasized that the destructive actions of the United Nations Command seriously undermine the Armistice Agreement and make the Korean Armistice unstable. These actions by the United Nations Command not only seriously threaten the peace of Korea but also seriously threaten the peace of Asia and the world.

Kang Sang-ho said in the letter that at the 80th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on February 1, I had already lodged the strongest protest with the United Nations Command regarding the above issues and demanded that the United Nations Command immediately cease all criminal activities, immediately transport out of Korea all illegally imported weapons such as atomic weapons, and report on this matter to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At the same time, I warned the United Nations Command that if the United Nations Command does not stop these criminal activities, it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Kang Sang-ho concluded in the letter, I am confident that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will pay close attention to the criminal activities of the United Nations Command that endanger the Korean Armistice, obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, and seriously threaten the peace of Korea and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. Korean newspapers reported that the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unanimously angrily condemned the United States for violating the Armistice Agreement by transporting atomic weapons into South Korea and turning South Korea into an atomic war base.

Employees of the Anju Silk Weaving Factory held a rally to denounce this provocative act by US imperialism. Model worker Kim In-sung said at the meeting, we will never allow US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique to violate the Armistice Agreement. He accused the United States of bringing atomic weapons into South Korea as a provocative act aimed at provoking a new war. He said that we advocate that the Armistice Agreement must be observed, the US invading army must immediately withdraw from South Korea, and the Korean people must peacefully reunify Korea themselves.

Li Ye-young, chairman of the management committee of the Yangyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Doksong County, South Hamgyong Province, said that no matter how rampant US imperialism is, it cannot thwart the Korean people who are firmly united under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the Republic government. We must defend the fruits of socialism and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　朝中方面写信给中监会
    抗议美国在南朝鲜挑衅
    新华社平壤3日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将今天写信给中立国监察委员会，抗议美方把原子武器运入南朝鲜并且在非军事区附近举行挑衅性的原子突击演习。
    信上说，在1月29日，联合国军司令部正式宣布已经把能够发射原子弹头的、口径二百八十公厘的原子大炮运入南朝鲜。在这以前，从1月20日到1月25日的期间内，联合国军方面在非军事区附近举行了原子突击演习，这是朝鲜停战以来，为了试验美军改编为“原子师”以后的攻击力量和机动性而进行的一次规模最大的演习。信中指出，这种挑衅行为是朝鲜停战以来联合国军方面一贯进行的破坏停战协定的各种罪恶活动的延续。
    信上说，联合国军方面企图通过在1957年6月21日片面宣布废除停战协定第十三款卯项的办法，来使它的非法行为合法化。但是，这种做法本身就严重地破坏了停战协定，并且完全是非法的和无效的。联合国军司令部方面企图以此来使它的新的破坏停战协定的行为合法化的愚蠢论调是完全不能成立的。
    信上指出：联合国军方面的任何诡辩都不能掩盖这一事实，即：它把原子武器运入南朝鲜和在非军事区附近举行挑衅性的原子突击演习等一系列严重破坏活动，是在积极地在远东进行原子战争准备，并且要把南朝鲜变为美国的原子战争基地和原子战争温床。
    信中强调指出，联合国军方面这种破坏行为严重地破坏了停战协定，使朝鲜停战变得不稳定。联合国军方面的这种行为不仅严重威胁朝鲜的和平，而且严重地威胁亚洲和世界和平。
    姜尚昊在信中说，我在2月1日举行军事停战委员会第八十次会议上，已经就上述问题向联合国军方面提出了最强硬的抗议，并且要求联合国军方面立即停止一切犯罪行为，立即把原子武器等所有非法运入南朝鲜的武器运出朝鲜，并且就这件事向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会提出报告。同时，我对联合国军方面提出警告说，如果联合国军方面不停止这种罪恶活动，它就必须对由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任。
    姜尚昊在信中最后说，我确信中立国监察委员会将密切注意联合国军方面的危害朝鲜停战、障碍朝鲜的和平统一以及严重威胁朝鲜和世界和平的罪恶活动。
    据新华社平壤3日电　朝鲜报纸报道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动人民一致愤怒谴责美国违反停战协定把原子武器运入南朝鲜和把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地的罪恶行为。
    安州丝织工厂职工举行了一个大会，斥责美帝国主义的这种挑衅行为。模范工人金仁成在会上说，我们绝不容许美帝国主义和李承晚集团违反停战协定。他指责美国把原子武器运进南朝鲜是企图挑起新战争的挑衅行为。他说，我们主张必须遵守停战协定，美国侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜，由朝鲜人民自己来和平统一朝鲜。
    咸镜南道德成郡杨榆农业生产合作社管理委员长李裔永说，不管美帝国主义怎样猖狂，它是挫折不了坚强地团结在劳动党和共和国政府领导下的朝鲜人民的，我们一定要保卫社会主义的果实。一定要实现祖国的和平统一。
