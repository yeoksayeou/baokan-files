Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th. Renowned Soviet Academy of Sciences academician and economist, Varga, told the "Neues Deutschland" correspondent in Moscow that the U.S. economic crisis of overproduction is bound to intensify and deepen further. The massive military budget formulated by the U.S. government cannot change this trend. Varga also stated that all indications show that the U.S. economic crisis is bound to affect all capitalist countries in Western Europe, especially Britain, West Germany, and France.

"Neues Deutschland" published this interview on the front page as the most important item on the 5th.

Varga said that the U.S. industrial production index (with 1947 to 1949 as 100) reached its peak of 146 in December 1956. The crisis of overproduction which started at that time was artificially concealed. In the first nine months of 1957, the production index fluctuated at the same level, but from October 1957, even this artificial method could no longer prevent the open outbreak of the crisis. The industrial production index fell to 136 in December 1957, a decrease of 7% compared to December 1956.

Cutting Water with a Knife Only Makes it Flow More
Varga pointed out that the U.S. used four artificial measures in the first nine months of 1957 to maintain industrial production: 1. Increasing commodity storage. From September 1956 to September 1957, industrial inventories increased from $50.8 billion to $54.1 billion, an increase of 6.5%. 2. Selling consumer goods on credit, that is, pre-spending future income. This method increased the total amount of consumer debt from $40 billion in September 1956 to $43 billion in September 1957, an increase of 7.5%. 3. Increasing exports: U.S. exports in the first nine months of 1957 were approximately $16 billion, while imports were only around $10 billion. This huge trade surplus once again caused a dollar shortage in other capitalist countries. 4. Strengthening the supply of goods based on existing orders, that is, the supply of goods exceeded the number of new orders received, thereby reducing the order amount month by month. For example, the industrial order amount in January 1957 was $64 billion, which dropped to $56 billion in September of the same year.

A Storm is Brewing
Varga pointed out that it is precisely because of these measures to artificially maintain production that the current crisis has a deeper and more acute nature. Now, newspapers are publishing news of various enterprise shutdowns every day. The number of unemployed has approached five million. The industrial wage index (with 1947 to 1949 as 100) was 171 in December 1956, falling to 162 in September 1957, and is currently around 150.

Varga pointed out that workers threatened by unemployment are now afraid to buy non-essential goods such as automobiles, televisions, and radios on credit, and merchants who have already felt the crisis coming have begun to try to reduce their inventories, sell off their goods, and no longer purchase goods, thereby further reducing the sales of industrial products. At the same time, capitalists whose profits in 1957 were much lower than the previous year have also begun to limit their investments, which has led to further reduction in production and a further increase in the number of unemployed.

Rob Peter to Pay Paul is of No Use
Varga emphasized that the increase in the U.S. military budget cannot play the role of a "prosperity factor." He said that U.S. capitalists hope to quickly end the crisis by increasing national military spending. However, this hope is unfounded. He said that despite the fact that U.S. military spending in 1957 (reaching $44 billion in the first nine months) increased by $4 billion (i.e., 10%) compared to 1956 ($40.4 billion), the crisis still occurred. So, how can continuing to increase the military budget by tens of billions of dollars end the crisis? Varga said that within a few months, the income of U.S. workers will decrease by 10% (a 1% decrease in workers' income means a $2 billion decrease in social purchasing power). Compared with the scale of this decrease, what is the value of increasing the military budget by tens of billions of dollars?

When it Rains, it Pours
Varga then pointed out that the U.S. crisis will drag all other capitalist countries into it. He pointed out that U.S. industrial products account for half of the industrial products of the entire capitalist world. The U.S. crisis of overproduction is bound to affect all other capitalist countries through foreign trade, exchanges, and international credit, especially those countries where the inherent factors of the crisis have already matured, such as Britain, West Germany, and France. Here, Varga pointed out the stagnation of British production, the reduction of industrial and commercial investment, and the monetary crisis; the termination of the investment boom and the difficulties of exports in West Germany; and the monetary crisis in France.

In addition, Varga also pointed out that the sharp decline in the prices of raw materials (including copper, tin, zinc, and rubber) has reduced the purchasing power of underdeveloped countries for industrial products, and has thereby aggravated the export difficulties of Western European countries. Varga believes that the intensification of the agricultural crisis in the capitalist world is also developing in the same direction.

　　苏联著名经济学家瓦尔加论证
    美国扩大军费挡不住经济危机
    英法和西德等国难免池鱼遭殃
    新华社柏林6日电　苏联科学院院士、著名经济学家瓦尔加对“新德意志报”驻莫斯科记者说，美国生产过剩的经济危机必然会进一步尖锐化和深刻化。美国政府制订的庞大军事预算也无法改变这种趋向。瓦尔加又说，一切迹象表明：美国的经济危机必定要波及西欧的所有资本主义国家，特别是英国、西德和法国。
    “新德意志报”5日以第一版首要地位刊载了这篇访问谈话。
    瓦尔加说，美国的工业生产指数（以1947到1949年为一百）在1956年12月是一百四十六，达到最高峰，从那时候开始的生产过剩危机，是被用人为办法掩盖住了的。在1957年头九个月，生产指数波动在同一个水平线上，但是从1957年10月起，就连这种人为的办法也再不能够阻挡危机的公开爆发了。工业生产指数在1957年12月降低到一百三十六，即比1956年12月降低了7％。
    抽刀断水水更流
    瓦尔加指出，美国在1957年头九个月用以维持工业生产的人为措施有四：一、增加商品的储存。从1956年9月到1957年9月，工业部门的存货由五百零八亿美元增加到了五百四十一亿美元，即增加了6.5％。二、以赊欠办法出售消费品，即预先支用未来的收入。这种办法使得消费债务总额从1956年9月的四百亿美元增加到1957年9月的四百三十亿美元，即增加了7.5％。三、增加出口：美国在1957年头九个月的出口约为一百六十亿美元，而入口只有一百亿美元左右。这种庞大的出超又一次引起了其他资本主义国家的美元荒。四、在旧有订货单的基础上加强了商品的供应，即商品的供应量超过了新收到的订货量，从而使订货额逐月减少，例如，1957年1月的工业订货额是六百四十亿美元，到同年9月降到五百六十亿美元。
    山雨欲来风满楼
    瓦尔加指出，正是由于这些人为地维持生产的措施，使目前的危机具有更加深刻和更加尖锐的性质。现在，报纸上每天都刊载着各种企业停工的新闻。失业人数已经接近五百万。工业工资指数（以1947到1949年为一百）在1956年12月是一百七十一，到1957年9月降到一百六十二，目前大约已经降到一百五十。
    瓦尔加指出，受到失业威胁的职工们现在已经不敢再用赊欠的办法购买那些可有可无的商品，如汽车、电视机和收音机等，而那些已经感觉到危机来临的商人们已经开始设法减少他们的存货、抛售他们的商品而不再购进商品，因而进一步减少了工业品的销售额。同时，那些在1957年所赚的利润比上一年大为减少的资本家们，也已经开始限制他们的投资，这样又导致了生产的进一步减少和失业人数的进一步增加。
    剜肉补疮不济事
    瓦尔加强调指出，美国军费预算的增加绝不能起“景气因素”的作用。他说，美国资本家们希望通过增加国家军费开支来使危机迅速告终。但是，这种希望是没有根据的。他说，尽管1957年美国的军费支出（头九个月就达四百四十亿美元）比1956年（四百零四亿美元）增加四十亿美元（即10％），危机还是发生了。那么，继续增加几十亿美元的军费又怎能会使危机终止呢？瓦尔加说，在几个月之内，美国职工的收入将要减少10％（职工收入减少1％就意味着社会购买力降低二十亿美元），同这种减少的规模相比，增加几十亿美元的军费预算又算得了什么呢？
    屋漏更遭连夜雨
    瓦尔加接着指出，美国的危机将使所有其他资本主义国家也被卷进去。他指出，美国的工业产品占整个资本主义世界工业产品的一半，美国的生产过剩危机必定会通过对外贸易、交易所、国际信用这些途径而波及所有其他资本主义国家、特别是那些本身危机内在因素已经成熟了的国家，如英国、西德和法国。在这里，瓦尔加指出了英国生产的停滞、工商业投资的减少和货币危机；西德投资景气的终止和出口的困难；法国的货币危机等现象。
    此外，瓦尔加还指出原料（包括铜、锡、锌、橡胶）价格的急剧下降已经使不发达国家减少了对工业产品的购买力，并且因而加重了西欧国家出口的困难。瓦尔加认为，资本主义世界农业危机的加剧也是在朝着同一个方向发展。
