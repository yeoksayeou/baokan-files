Notes

    As a Matter of Course
    U.S. Senator Dworshak said indignantly: Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has spent six times less money than the United States on foreign aid, but its results are twenty-nine times greater. The calculation made by Dworshak is not entirely accurate, but it reveals the true sorrow of the so-called "thankless task" of American foreign aid.

    What is the reason for this? It is simple. It is precisely because the Soviet Union gives to other countries without selfish motives, sincerely helping others, and the countries receiving aid can truly benefit, that it is universally welcomed; while American aid is a bait to enslave and plunder others. It seems that they give others a lot of money, but in fact, they take more from others. Whoever accepts "U.S. aid" is destined to be unlucky, so discerning people will not be fooled. The essence of the two kinds of "aid" is different, and the "results" are naturally different. This is a reality that the likes of Dworshak cannot change.

    理所当然
    美国参议员德沃夏克愤愤不平地说：自从战争结束以来，苏联在援外方面花费的钱比美国少六倍，但它的收效却大二十九倍。德沃夏克所算的这笔账是并不对头的，但是却颇道出了美国的所谓对外援助“费力不讨好”的真正悲哀。
    原因究竟何在呢？说来很简单，正是因为苏联给予别的国家并不存着自私的目的，真心为了援助别人，受援助的国家也真正能得到好处，所以受到普遍欢迎；而美国的援助却是一种对别人进行奴役和掠夺的诱饵，好像给了别人不少钱，实际上反而从别人身上弄回更多的东西，谁接受“美援”谁就注定倒霉，所以明眼人都不会上当。两种“援助”实质不同，“收效”也就自然有异了。这是德沃夏克之流无法改变的现实。
