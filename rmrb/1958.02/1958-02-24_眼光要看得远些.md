Expanding public accumulation continuously in agricultural cooperatives is an important condition for further developing agricultural production and consolidating agricultural cooperatives. People are generally in agreement on the principle of this issue, but in practice, they are very inconsistent. Those with farther vision try to retain more public accumulation funds during annual distribution; those with shorter vision only focus on increasing the current income of cooperative members and retain very little public accumulation funds. Today, with several years of experience in running cooperatives and the rapid development of agricultural production, the role of public accumulation has become very clear. Agricultural cooperatives that continuously expand public accumulation can continuously carry out agricultural capital construction; production develops quickly, and the income of cooperative members also increases significantly. Agricultural cooperatives that retain little or no public accumulation funds, even though the current income of cooperative members can also increase, often suffer many losses in collective production due to lack of funds. Anfu Agricultural Cooperative in Nan County, Hunan Province, and Dongtingwei Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangyin County are two of the most obvious examples.

For several years, Anfu Cooperative has paid attention to continuously increasing public accumulation. During annual distribution, it has always retained 2% to 3% of public accumulation funds and 1% to 2% of public welfare funds. With the addition of share funds paid by cooperative members, the average public accumulation per member has reached twenty-five yuan by last year. At the beginning of the cooperative, the entire cooperative had only seventy-eight head of cattle, but now it has increased to one hundred and thirty-five head; not only are all sizes of farm tools complete, but the cooperative also bought two water pumps in 1956; coupled with large-scale water conservancy projects and increased fertilizer accumulation, the grain yield per unit area of this cooperative has exceeded the level of local wealthy middle peasants.

The natural conditions of Dongtingwei Agricultural Cooperative are roughly the same as those of Anfu Cooperative. This cooperative achieved bumper harvests in 1955 and 1956, and grain production reached more than eight hundred catties per mu. All cooperative members have fundamentally changed their state of poverty. However, this cooperative did not pay attention to expanding public accumulation. During the distribution in 1956, after deducting state taxes, loans, internal production funds, public accumulation funds, and public welfare funds, only 190,000 yuan should have been distributed to cooperative members. However, they would rather delay state loans and retain less public accumulation, distributing 250,000 yuan to cooperative members. By doing so, the income of cooperative members increased, with an average increase of more than 45% per person in 1956 compared to 1955, but the cooperative's coffers were emptied. Last spring, the cooperative's production funds were not in place, so they had to borrow from the state again. Because there was no money, the collective pig-raising plan was only 20% completed; rice crops were infested with insects between summer and autumn, and the cooperative had no money to buy pesticides; not much fertilizer (lime) was bought either. Therefore, production in 1957 remained at the level of 1956, with an estimated loss of at least 50,000 yuan.

This cooperative's approach is not only detrimental to collective production, but also not good for individual cooperative members. In 1956, cooperative members received a lot of grain and cash, and the cooperative did not conduct a good education on diligence and thrift. Many cooperative members had wasteful habits in terms of spending money. That year, the cooperative held more than two thousand tables of banquets for weddings and funerals, and every household made sweet wine and glutinous rice cakes during the Spring Festival. After cooperative members ate and used it freely like that, seventy-four "households in difficulty" appeared in the spring of the following year, and the cooperative had to take care of their lives and solve their difficulties.

Facts provide people with profound education. Now, the cadres and members of these two agricultural cooperatives, based on personal experience, unanimously realize that expanding public accumulation is a very important matter. In the distribution of 1957, Anfu Cooperative retained 8% of the total income for public accumulation funds and 2% for public welfare funds. This year, they plan to use public accumulation funds to buy two more water pumps, dig two channels, and build a regulating gate and two river dams, fundamentally solving the water conservancy problems of the entire cooperative, and striving to achieve a plan of producing a thousand catties of grain and a hundred catties of ginned cotton per mu.

The members of Dongtingwei Agricultural Cooperative also painfully summarized the lessons of the past and unanimously decided to retain 10,000 yuan of public accumulation funds, more than 4,000 yuan of public welfare funds, and 50,000 catties of reserve grain in the distribution of 1957.

    眼光要看得远些
    高长任
    农业社不断地扩大公共积累，是进一步发展农业生产和巩固农业社的重要条件。人们对于这个问题的认识原则上是一致的，但具体做起来，却又很不一致。眼光看得远些的人，在每年分配的时候，都尽量多留些公积金；眼光看得近的人，就光从增加社员当前收入方面着眼，把公积金留得很少。在办社已有几年经验，农业生产已有飞跃发展的今天，公共积累的作用已经十分明显了。凡是不断扩大公积金的农业社，就可以不断进行农业基本建设；生产发展得快，社员收入也增加得多。少留或不留公积金的农业社，尽管社员的当前收入也能增加，但社里的集体生产，往往因缺乏资金而造成许多损失。湖南省南县安福农业社和湘阴县洞庭围农业社就是两个最明显的例子。
    安福社几年来一直注意了不断增加公共积累，每年分配时，都留足了2％到3％的公积金，1％到2％的公益金，加上社员缴纳的股份基金，到去年平均每个社员已有二十五元的公共积累。建社初期，全社只有七十八头耕牛，现在已增加到一百三十五头；不仅大小农具齐备，1956年社里还买了两台抽水机；加上大兴水利和增积肥料等条件，这个社的粮食单位面积产量已超过当地富裕中农的水平。
    洞庭围农业社的自然条件与安福社大体一样。这个社在1955和1956年连续获得大丰收，粮食产量已达亩产八百斤以上，全体社员已从根本上改变了贫困状态。但这个社不注意扩大公共积累，1956年分配的时候，如果扣除国家的税金、贷款、社内的生产资金和公积金、公益金之后，只应该分给社员十九万元。但是他们宁愿拖欠国家贷款，少留公共积累，将二十五万元分给社员。这样做，社员收入是增加了，1956年每人平均比1955年增加了45％以上，但社里的家底却空了。去年春天，社里的生产资金没有着落，只得又向国家贷款。因为没有钱，集体养猪的计划只完成20％；夏秋之间稻谷生了虫，社里也没有钱买农药；肥料（石灰）也买得不多。因此，1957年的生产仍然停留在1956年的水平上，估计至少损失五万元左右。
    这个社的做法不仅对集体生产不利，对社员个人也没有好处。1956年，社员分得的粮食和现金很多，社里没有很好进行勤俭持家的教育，许多社员在用钱方面有浪费现象。那一年，这个社因婚丧喜事共办了二千多桌酒席，春节期间家家户户做甜酒、糍粑。社员们这样放手吃了，用了，到第二年春天就出现了七十四户“困难户”，社里还得来照顾他们的生活，解决他们的困难。
    事实给人以深刻的教育。现在，这两个农业社的干部和社员，根据亲身体会，一致认识到扩大公共积累是非常重要的一件大事了。安福社在1957年的分配中，留下了占总收入8％的公积金、2％的公益金。今年他们计划用公积金再买两台抽水机，挖两条渠道，修一座节制闸和两座拦河坝，从根本上解决全社的水利问题，争取实现亩产千斤粮，百斤皮棉的计划。
    洞庭围农业社的社员们也沉痛地总结了过去的教训，一致决定在1957年的分配中留足一万元的公积金，四千多元的公益金和五万斤储备粮。
