Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, February 6th: According to an announcement on the 5th, Swedish Prime Minister Erlander, in his reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, stated that Sweden approves of the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting. He said that if discussions on the most important international issues (even if only one issue is discussed) can bring the participants' attitudes closer, then holding a summit meeting would be fully justified.

In replying to Bulganin's letter of January 8th, Erlander said: If the major powers reach an agreement on the composition and agenda of such a meeting and hope that Sweden will participate, Sweden will not object to participating in such a meeting.

Erlander advocated seeking to define the topics to be discussed by the heads of government through informal preparatory consultations between governments.

He also pointed out that among the issues that Bulganin suggested for discussion at the summit meeting, the Swedish government is particularly interested in the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and the drafting of an agreement on preventing surprise attacks.

At the same time, Erlander believes that the summit meeting is best held under the auspices of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 6th: "Warsaw Life Daily" published an interview with Danish Prime Minister Hansen on the 4th. Hansen said that Poland's proposal to "establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is a contribution to the discussion of the possibility of making progress in the cause of peace. This proposal is worthy of attention and consideration."

Hansen expressed his support for Poland's proposal to make the Baltic Sea a sea of peace, saying that Denmark is particularly concerned about peace in the Baltic Sea region due to its geographical location.

Hansen believes that achieving reconciliation between East and West has become "an international issue that overrides all other issues." He also expressed his hope to develop economic and cultural cooperation between Denmark and Poland.

Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, February 6th: According to TASS, Oslo, on the 5th, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, in a conversation with a reporter from "Volksbladet," said that the Norwegian government, like the more than 9,000 scientists around the world who signed the appeal to stop nuclear weapons testing, is concerned about the dangers that such testing poses to humanity. He said: Only the signing of an agreement to stop the production of nuclear weapons will completely eliminate this danger.

Lange then emphasized that to achieve full mutual trust and a genuine relaxation of tensions, at least an agreement must be reached on supervised disarmament (which also stipulates a cessation of the production of nuclear weapons). Lange supported the suggestion to temporarily suspend nuclear weapons testing and considered it to be the first step.

　　瑞典首相赞成举行最高级会议  丹麦首相响应波兰的和平主张
    挪威外交大臣支持暂停核试验的建议
    新华社6日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：据5日宣布，瑞典首相埃兰德在给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的复信中说，瑞典赞成苏联提出的举行最高级会议的建议。他说，如果关于最重要的国际问题的讨论（即使讨论一个问题也好），能够使参加者的态度接近起来，那末举行最高级会议就是有充分根据的了。
    埃兰德在答复布尔加宁1月8日来信的时候说：如果大国就这样一次会议的组成和议程取得协议并且希望有瑞典参加的话，瑞典不反对参加这样一次会议。
    埃兰德主张通过政府之间半正式的预备性商谈来设法规定政府首脑们要讨论的题目。
    他还指出，在布尔加宁建议最高级会议讨论的问题中，瑞典政府对立刻停止试验核武器、在中欧设立无原子武器区和拟订有关防止突然进攻的协定等问题特别感兴趣。
    同时，埃兰德认为最高级会议最好在联合国的主持下举行。
    新华社6日讯　华沙消息：在“华沙生活报”4日发表了一篇丹麦首相汉森的访问记。汉森说，波兰提出的“建立中欧无核武器区的这个主张是对于讨论在和平事业中取得进展的可能性的一个贡献。这个主张是值得注意和考虑的。”
    汉森表示支持波兰提出的使波罗的海成为和平的海洋的建议，他说，由于丹麦的地理位置，它特别关心波罗的海地区的和平。
    汉森认为使东西方之间取得和解已经成为“凌驾所有其他问题之上的一个国际问题”。他还表示希望发展丹麦和波兰之间的经济和文化合作。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社奥斯陆5日讯：挪威外交大臣兰基同“沃尔特·兰德报”记者谈话时说，挪威政府也像世界各国九千多名科学家关于停止试验核武器的呼吁书中所表示的那样，对这种试验给人类带来的危险感到不安。他说：只有签订停止生产核武器的协定才会完全消除这种危险。
    兰基接着强调说，要取得充分的互相信任和真正的缓和紧张局势至少必须对有监督的裁减军备问题（其中也规定停止生产核武器）达成协议。兰基支持暂时停止试验核武器的建议，并且认为这是第一步。
