Gansu's "Sand Fields"
By our reporter, Liu Bang

    A newcomer to central Gansu will surely be amazed by a peculiar phenomenon - fields covering the slopes and plains are all covered with a layer of pebbles the size of goose eggs. Is this the Gobi Desert? No! This is the biggest feature of agriculture in Gansu, and a great creation of the local working people in their struggle against the arid natural environment! It is called "Sand Field".

    Sand field refers to farmland where the soil is covered with a layer of coarse sand and small stones about three inches thick. The roots of the crops are still in the soil, but the stems grow outside through the sand layer. This is a method of cultivation to preserve moisture and resist drought. The birth of this method has greatly expanded the cultivated area in Gansu and increased the yield per unit area.

    When did sand fields begin? There are different opinions. Judging from the existing old sand fields in Hongxian Township, Jingtai County, it should be more than a hundred years ago. According to local legends, there were years of severe drought in central Gansu during the mid-Qing Dynasty, with thousands of miles of barren land and no greenery. An old farmer discovered several millet plants on a hillside that were not only not withered and dead, but also green and luxuriant, with strong ears. Why? After careful observation, it turned out that these crops were growing on piles of gravel dug out by ground squirrels. Peeling back the gravel, the soil underneath was moist. He suddenly realized that laying sand had the function of preserving moisture and resisting drought. So he tried to pull some stones and lay them on the cultivated land. Later, the crops in this field grew particularly well. After that, through continuous research, improvement, and promotion by nearby farmers, this cultivation method has spread to Dingxi, Yuzhong, Gaolan, Yongdeng, Jingyuan, Jingtai, and Huining areas in central Gansu today.

    After liberation, through the research of agronomists, it was confirmed that this "local method" of farmers completely conforms to scientific principles. First, the temperature change of the soil covered by sand and stone is small day and night. Over time, the soil temperature of the sand field is higher than that of ordinary soil fields. This higher and uniform temperature will inevitably have a good impact on the growth of plant roots. Second, the loose sand and stone layer cuts off the capillary action of the soil, reducing the rise and evaporation of soil moisture. At the same time, under the cover of the sand and stone layer, the soil surface is not exposed to wind and sun, which also reduces evaporation. In addition, the loose sand and stone layer can receive all the rainwater, allowing it to infiltrate into the soil without the so-called "runoff" (flowing from the ground surface) phenomenon, which is also conducive to plant growth. Third, because sand and stone can cut off capillaries and reduce the rise of groundwater, they can also reduce the rise of underground salt solutions, thereby effectively preventing salinization of the surface soil. Fourth, sand fields also have the effect of preventing soil erosion and weed growth.

    The climate in Gansu is abnormally dry. The annual rainfall in the central region is only about 300 millimeters. Between spring and summer, when crops need water most urgently, the total rainfall is less than 50 millimeters. In some places, the degree of soil salinization is also very serious, and a layer of white alkali frost often forms on the ground. Drought and alkali damage have become the biggest threats to agricultural production here. The appearance of sand fields helps to overcome these two types of disasters.

    However, laying sand fields is an arduous task. The effective use period of laying sand is generally 50 to 60 years, or 30 to 40 years. Sand fields within ten years are called new sand fields, ten to thirty years are called middle sand fields, and thirty to fifty years are called old sand fields. The yield of sand fields generally decreases gradually from new to old. When the sand and soil are completely mixed together, they lose their effect and need to be relaid. Therefore, farmers say that laying sand is: "Tiring the father to death, feeding the son to fullness, and starving the grandson." This proverb reflects that under the feudal system, the ability of farmers to lay sand fields was very weak. According to relevant historical records, from the mid-Qing Dynasty to the eve of liberation, there were only more than 800,000 mu of sand fields in Gansu Province. Among them, old sand fields accounted for more than half, so that "farmers who own 300 mu of old sand fields are not enough to be well-fed".

    After liberation, the National Bank issued a large number of "sand laying" loans to farmers to encourage the development of sand fields. The administrative leading departments of agriculture and scientific research institutions began to investigate and study sand fields. At present, there are about 1.5 million mu of sand fields in the province. In the first year after entering the high tide of cooperativization, the province added about 300,000 mu of sand fields. Due to the implementation of the sand field cultivation system, many cultivated lands that fundamentally lack irrigation conditions can obtain high and stable yields; the land on the dry plateau can also cultivate economic crops with high value; at the same time, it has expanded the planting range of many precious melons, fruits and vegetables. The soil salinization in Qinhuangchuan, Gaolan County, is very serious, and only alkali-resistant weeds can grow. Local residents have always relied on animal husbandry for their livelihoods. With sand fields, Qinhuangchuan began to have agriculture. According to experiments by the Department of Biology of Lanzhou University, the various development stages of sand field wheat are generally five to six days earlier than that of soil field wheat. The harvest period is also more than ten days earlier. The yield of new sand field wheat is as high as more than 500 jin per mu, which is about three times higher than that of dry soil fields. The yield increase effect of sand fields is more significant in cotton production. Lanzhou is 1,500 meters above sea level, and the ground temperature is much lower than that of coastal provinces and the North China Plain. However, Lanzhou is also a famous city of melons and fruits in the country. Here, you can eat plump and delicious winter pears, delicious lilies, white melon with the taste of tuberose, peppers and tomatoes as big as fists. The listing period of these vegetables and melons and fruits is not later than that of Beijing. This should be attributed to the sand fields.

    How much work does it take to lay a sand field? According to a survey by relevant departments in Jingtai County, laying one mu of sand field, if the sand source is about 70 meters away from the cultivated land, only 25 people and 25 donkeys need to work for a day. If it is one person and one donkey, it takes 50 days of work. Using the slack winter time, one person can lay one mu a year, which is not too difficult in the rural areas after cooperativization. Whether it is planting grain, vegetables, or melons and fruits in new sand fields, the investment in laying sand can be recovered in the same year. Before 1954, the Jiefang Agricultural Cooperative in Xigu District of Lanzhou had no new sand land that could grow melons. From 1955 to 1957, 424 mu of new sand fields were laid. In 1955, it produced more than 260,000 jin of watermelon, and in 1957 it increased to more than 1.9 million jin. Before laying sand, the average annual income per mu of dry land was 10.06 yuan; after laying sand and planting watermelon, the annual income per mu was 287.5 yuan, which is more than 27 times that before laying sand.

    There is a kind of杞人忧天 saying that hinders the development of this cultivation method: "Sand fields cannot be plowed with tractors, so whether it should be promoted is still worth considering." The answer is: The universal use of tractors in rural areas cannot be realized in a year or two; and laying sand can increase production in the same year, so what is wrong with it? Of course, it is also absolutely necessary to study and improve the agricultural tools for cultivating sand fields so that they are adapted to modern agriculture. (Attached picture)

### 甘肃的“砂田”

　　甘肃的“砂田”
　　本报记者　柳梆
    初到甘肃中部的陌生人，一定会对于一种奇特的现象感到惊讶——满坡遍野的田地都铺着一层鹅卵那样大小的石子。难道是戈壁滩吗？不！这是甘肃农业上一个最大的特色，是当地劳动人民在和干旱的自然环境斗争中的一种伟大的创造！它，就叫“砂田”。
    砂田，就是在农田的土壤上复盖着一层三寸上下的粗砂小石，作物的根部依然札在土壤里面，茎部却穿过砂层生长在外边。这是一种保墒抗旱的耕作方法。这个方法的诞生，大大地扩大了甘肃的耕地面积，提高了单位面积的产量。
    砂田起始于何年何月？至今各说不一。从景泰县红岘乡现存的一些老砂田来考察，当在一百多年以前。根据各地的传说，在清朝中叶，甘肃中部连年大旱，赤地千里，野无绿色。一位老农发现山坡上有几株谷子，不但没有干枯死掉，而且青绿繁茂，穗粒壮实。为什么？仔细观察，原来这几株庄稼是生长在地鼠打洞扒出来的砂砾堆上。扒开砂砾瞧，下面的土壤是潮湿的。他猛然醒悟到铺砂有保墒抗旱的功能。于是试着拉些石子铺在耕作过的土地上，后来果然这块地的庄稼长得特别茁壮。在这以后，又经过附近农民的不断研究、改进和推广，到今天，这种耕作方法就传遍了甘肃中部的定西、榆中、皋兰、永登、靖远、景泰、会宁一带。
    解放以后，经过农学家们的研究，证实农民的这种“土办法”完全符合科学原理。第一，由于砂石所复盖的土壤，昼夜的温度变化较小。日积月累，使得砂田的土温高于一般土田之上。这种较高而且均匀的温度，对于植物根系的生长必然发生良好的影响。第二，由于疏松的砂石层切断了土壤的毛细管的作用，减少了土壤水分的上升和蒸发，同时在砂石层的复盖下，土壤表层受不到风吹日晒，也减少蒸发作用。此外，疏松的砂石层可以接收全部雨水，使之渗入土壤中，而不发生所谓“径流”（从地表面上流掉）现象，这也有利于植物的生长。第三，由于砂石具有切断毛细管，减低地下水份上升的作用，因而也能减低地下盐类溶液的上升，从而就有效地防止了表层土壤的盐碱化。第四，砂田还有防止土壤冲刷和杂草生长的功效。
    甘肃气候异常干燥。中部地区年雨量仅三百公厘左右。春夏之交，作物需水最迫切的时候，总雨量不到五十公厘。有些地方土壤盐碱化的程度也很严重，地面上经常结成一层白色碱霜。旱灾和碱害已经成为这里农业生产上最大的威胁。砂田的出现，恰好有助于克服这两方面的灾害。
    但是，铺设砂田是一种艰巨的劳动。铺一次砂一般有效的使用期多则五六十年，少则三四十年。十年以内的叫新砂田，十到三十年叫中砂田，三十到五十年叫老砂田。砂田的产量一般都由新到老，逐渐递减。等到砂和土完全掺混在一起的时候，便失去作用，需重新铺设。所以农民们说铺砂是：“累死老子，撑（饱）死儿子，饿死孙子”。这个谚语反映了在封建制度下，农民铺设砂田的能力是很薄弱的。据有关史料的记载，从清朝中叶发展到解放前夕，甘肃全省只有砂田八十多万亩。其中老砂田已占半数以上，以至“拥有老砂田三百亩的农家，尚不足以温饱”。
    解放后，国家银行大量向农民发放“铺砂”贷款，鼓励农民发展砂田。农业的行政领导部门和科学研究机关，着手对砂田进行调查研究。目前，全省已约有砂田一百五十万亩。进入合作化高潮后的第一年，全省增加砂田约三十多万亩。由于砂田耕作制度的推行，使得许多根本缺乏灌溉条件的耕地也可以获得高额而稳定的产量；使得干燥的高原上的土地也可能栽培经济价值很高的作物；同时也为许多珍贵的瓜果蔬菜扩大了种植的范围。皋兰县的秦皇川土壤盐碱化非常严重，只能生长耐碱的小草。当地居民向来依靠畜牧为生。有了砂田，秦皇川才开始有了农业。根据兰州大学生物系的实验，砂田小麦的各个发育时期，一般都比土田小麦提前五到六日。收获期也提早十余天。新砂田种小麦的产量每亩高达五百多斤，较之干旱土田约高三倍。砂田的增产作用在棉花的产量上表现更为显著。兰州海拔一千五百多公尺，地温远较沿海各省和华北平原低。然而兰州同时却是一个驰名全国的瓜果城市。在这里，你可以吃到肥硕可口的冬果梨，鲜美的百合，味同晚香玉的白兰瓜，大如拳头的辣椒和西红柿。这些蔬菜和瓜果的上市期间并不比北京晚。这应当归功于砂田。
    铺砂田究竟需要多少工夫呢？根据有关部门在景泰县的调查，铺一亩砂田，如果砂源距离耕地约七十公尺，只要二十五个人和二十五头驴工作一天。如果是一人一驴，需要工作五十天。利用冬闲时间，一人一年铺一亩，在合作化后的农村是不算太困难的。新砂田不管是种粮食、蔬菜或瓜果，铺砂的投资当年就可以收回来。兰州西固区解放农业社1954年以前没有一亩可以种瓜的新砂地。1955年到1957年，铺了四百二十四亩新砂田。1955年产了西瓜二十六万多斤，1957年增加到一百九十多万斤。铺砂以前，每亩旱地每年平均收入十元零六角；铺砂以后种西瓜，每亩每年即可收入二百八十七元五角，等于铺砂前的二十七倍多。
    有一种类似?人忧天的说法在障碍这一耕作方法的开展：“砂田不能用拖拉机翻地，因此，应否推广还值得考虑。”答复是：农村普遍使用拖拉机，不是一年两年就能实现的；而铺上砂当年就能增加生产，这有何不可呢？当然，至于研究和改进耕作砂田的农具，使之和现代化的农业相适应，这也是完全必要的。（附图片）
