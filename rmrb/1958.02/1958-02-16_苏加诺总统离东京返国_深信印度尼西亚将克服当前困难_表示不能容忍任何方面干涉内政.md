Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 15th: Indonesian President Sukarno concluded his eighteen-day visit to Japan today and left Tokyo by plane at a little after 7:00 PM to return home.

At the airport, Sukarno delivered a speech saying, "Like any country, Indonesia has its difficulties and its times of highs and lows, but I deeply believe that after a period of time, Indonesia and the Indonesian people will overcome these difficulties." He said, "There is no reason to be alarmed or anxious."

Sukarno said, "We only expect everyone to have an objective understanding of us, but on the other hand, we cannot tolerate any person or any party interfering in our domestic affairs."

The day before his departure, Sukarno delivered a speech in Tokyo to students from Japan, Indonesia, and other Asian countries, condemning imperialism and colonialism. Sukarno said, "The two blocs can coexist peacefully." He said, "This is my belief," "This belief has been confirmed." "But there can be no peaceful coexistence between colonialism and colonized peoples."

Sukarno said, "Our revolution is a huge process, sometimes it rises, sometimes it falls. But we are sure that our revolution will succeed. We have two goals—complete independence and the establishment of a prosperous and happy society. These two goals must be achieved, because this is the trend of history."

Sukarno left the country on January 6 for rest and visits. Over the past month, he has visited India, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Syria, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, and Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 15th: The All-Indonesia Central Labor Union, the People's Youth League, the Indonesian Women's Movement Association, the Indonesian Peasants' Front, and the Democratic Youth League led by the Nationalist Party, among other mass organizations, have issued statements in the past two days supporting the government and the Army Chief of Staff's decision to arrest rebels such as Hussein and Lubis. Seventeen Sumatran people's organizations in Jakarta held a meeting on the evening of the 14th and made a decision to support the government and the Army Chief of Staff's measures against rebels such as Hussein, and expressed their willingness to help the government restore the situation to normal.

Former Seventh Military Region Commander Sumual, who had been notified to report to Jakarta, went to the Philippines after leaving Japan. He held a press conference in Manila on the 14th and made remarks betraying the Indonesian government. Indonesian student leaders studying in the Philippines entered the press conference venue and directly denounced him as a traitor.
