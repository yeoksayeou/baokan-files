What Kind of “Lesson”?
Yuè Jūn

Through the discussion of the “red” and “expert” issue, various fallacies against being both “red” and “expert” have been refuted. Many people have understood that neither the path of the misguided "pragmatist" nor the path of the empty-headed politician is viable. However, I would like to say a few words about one of the fallacies, the "political danger theory." After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, people's political and ideological levels have improved, but some people, after admitting that their remarks during the blooming and contending period were wrong, say: "In the past, I never cared about politics, and there were no problems. When I paid attention during the great blooming and contending, problems arose; those who spent all day carrying books and going to the library without caring about politics, on the contrary, had no problems." Thus, they conclude: "Politics are untouchable," "Politics are too dangerous," "In the future, ask less about politics and focus more on business." Some even regard this as "the biggest lesson of their lives"!

This lesson is very bad. Isn't the attitude of those who spend all day carrying books and going to the library without caring about politics the same as the attitude of those who "never cared about politics in the past" yesterday? Isn't the fact that the latter "had problems" today the result of their not caring about politics yesterday? A person who does not care about politics cannot have a correct and firm class stand and a keen political sense, and is most likely to make mistakes when the revolutionary struggle is sharp. To avoid making mistakes, one must actively care about politics, stand firmly on the proletarian stand, study Marxism-Leninism, constantly transform oneself, and consciously integrate with the workers, peasants, and laboring masses. A person without a political soul, lost in political direction, is truly dangerous.

Some people also say: "Some old party members and old cadres have been engaged in politics for twenty or thirty years, and in the end, they are still rightists. It is clear that engaging in politics is too dangerous." This view is really one-sided. In the anti-rightist struggle, wasn't it also proven that there were many more old party members and old cadres who were strong revolutionary fighters? Why haven't they had any problems after engaging in politics for twenty or thirty years? Therefore, the key lies in what kind of politics you are engaged in. If you are engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist politics, of course, it is dangerous.

Through the anti-rightist struggle, we can learn some beneficial lessons, such as: if a person does not consciously transform their thinking and does not consciously strive in the direction of "redness," even if they have been in a revolutionary environment for a long time, there is still a danger of making political mistakes. Anyone who deviates from the guidance of advanced political thought is bound to make political mistakes. However, those who advocate the "political danger theory" draw a lesson from the rightists in the Party that is contrary to ours, and instead, they don't want to be "red" anymore. At first, I was very strange about this and couldn't figure out the reason. But later, I found the answer in a student's words. The student said: "Politics are not only dangerous but also empty. Business is the real thing. Achieving success in science brings both fame and fortune." It turns out that the decadent individualism is still at work. Originally, considering whether or not to care about politics and whether or not to participate in the proletarian revolution based on whether politics are dangerous or not is a consideration based on individualism. People who consider things in this way are simply not worthy of being revolutionaries!

The socialist revolution we are carrying out now is possibly bloodless because the people hold the state tools such as the army, police, government, and courts. However, since it is a revolution, there is struggle. Society will always have struggles. In class society, there is class struggle; in the society after the elimination of classes, there will still be, and always will be, struggles between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, etc. However, the nature and form of the struggle are different from class struggle. Struggles always follow one after another. Our society is constantly developing forward in this continuous struggle. "Politics" reflects the relationship between people in society. Since people live in society, it is impossible to stay away from politics and struggle. If you want to avoid problems in future struggles, you can only draw correct and beneficial lessons from this rightist attack and the anti-rightist struggle; if the lesson learned is "ask less about politics and focus more on business," then there is a danger of repeating today's mistakes in future struggles; at that time, "the biggest lesson of your life" will become "the biggest regret of your life."

### 什么样的“教训”？

    什么样的“教训”？
    岳军
    经过“红”与“专”问题的讨论，种种反对又“红”又“专”的谬论，已经遭到批驳。很多人明白了：无论是迷失方向的“实际家”的道路，或者是空头政治家的道路，都是走不通的。但我对其中有一种“政治危险论”的谬论，还想说几句。经过整风和反右派斗争，人们在政治上思想上有了提高，然而也有人在承认自己鸣放期间的言论是错误的以后，却说：“过去我一直不关心政治，什么问题也没有，大鸣大放时关心了一下，结果却出了毛病；那些整天背书包上图书馆不关心政治的人，反倒没有问题。”于是得出的结论是：“政治沾不得”、“政治太危险”、“以后少问政治，多搞业务”。竟然有人以此为“一生最大的教训”哩！
    这教训很不妙。那些整天背书包上图书馆不关心政治者的态度，不正是“过去我一直不关心政治”者的昨天的态度么？后者今天“出了毛病”，不正是他昨天不关心政治的结果么？一个人不关心政治，是不可能有正确的坚定的阶级立场和敏锐的政治嗅觉的，在革命斗争尖锐的时候，就最容易犯错误。要不犯错误，只有积极地去关心政治，站稳无产阶级立场，学习马列主义，不断地改造自己，自觉地和工农劳动群众结合。一个人没有政治灵魂、迷失了政治方向，才是真正危险的。
    有人又说：“有些老党员老干部，政治搞了二、三十年，结果还是个右派分子，可见搞政治太危险。”这看法，实在片面得很。就在反右派斗争中，不也证明：有更多得多的老党员、老干部是坚强的革命战士么？为什么他们政治搞了二、三十年没有出毛病呢？所以，关键只在你搞的是什么政治。如果你搞的是反党反人民反社会主义的政治，当然是危险的。
    经过反右派斗争，我们可以得到一些有益的教训，譬如：一个人不自觉地改造思想，不自觉地向“红”的方向努力，即便长期处身于革命环境之中，仍然有在政治上犯错误的危险。任何人离开了先进的政治思想的指导，一定要犯政治性的错误。然而“政治危险论”者却从党内右派分子身上，得出和我们相反的教训，反而不想“红”了，对这，开始时我是很奇怪，而且悟不出其中道理的。但后来我在一个学生的话里，却找到了答案。那学生说：“政治不但危险，而且是空的，业务才是实在的。科学上有了成就，名利双收。”原来还是那个腐朽的个人主义在作怪。本来，从政治危险不危险，来考虑要不要关心政治，要不要参加无产阶级革命，这考虑问题的出发点，就是个人主义的。这样考虑的人，根本就不配作一个革命者！
    我们现在进行的社会主义革命，因为人民握有了军队、警察、政权、法院等等国家工具，所以，就有可能是不流血的。然而既是革命，便有斗争。社会是永远会有斗争的。在阶级社会，有阶级斗争；在消灭了阶级之后的社会，也还有、而且永远会有新与旧、先进与落后等等的斗争。不过斗争的性质和形式，不同于阶级斗争罢了。斗争总是一个紧接着一个的。我们的社会便在这不断斗争中不断地向前发展。“政治”是反映社会上人与人之间的关系的。人既然生活在社会之中，便不可能远离政治、远离斗争。若要自己在今后的斗争中不出毛病，只有从这次右派进攻和反右派斗争中，吸取正确的有益的教训；如果得出的教训是“少问政治，多搞业务”之类，那么在未来的斗争中，便有再犯今天的错误的危险；到那时，“一生最大的教训”会成为“一生最大的憾事”了。
