    Be a Thorough Revolutionary!
    On February 4th, the Yunnan Daily published an editorial entitled "In the Great Leap Forward of Production, Be a Thorough Revolutionary!" The editorial raised a sharp question to the broad masses of cadres, especially those in leadership positions: In the situation of the Great Leap Forward, are you going to be a thorough revolutionary, or a reformist, a status quo maintainer? The editorial pointed out that to be a revolutionary, one must despise the past and "believe" in the future, dare to strategically despise difficulties, and dare to change conventions, old habits, and backward conditions. The editorial used many facts to illustrate that revolutionaries have already accomplished things that predecessors could not. At the same time, the editorial criticized the various manifestations of reformists and status quo maintainers: shrinking back, being overly cautious, emphasizing difficulties, and emphasizing special circumstances, etc.

    要做彻底的革命派！
    4日，云南日报发表了题为“在生产大跃进中，要做彻底的革命派！”的社论。社论向广大干部特别是做领导工作的干部提出了一个尖锐的问题：在大跃进的形势下，是做彻底的革命派呢？还是做改良派、现状维持派呢？社论指出，要做革命派，就要轻视过去、“迷信”将来，敢于从战略上轻视困难，敢于改变陈规、旧习和落后状态。社论用许多事实说明革命派已经办了前人所不能办的事情。社论同时批判了改良派和现状维持派的种种表现：畏缩不前、顾虑重重、强调困难、强调情况特殊等。
