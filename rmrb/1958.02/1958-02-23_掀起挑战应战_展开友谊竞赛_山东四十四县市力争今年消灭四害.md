Launching Challenges and Responding to Challenges, Unfolding Friendly Competition
Forty-Four Counties and Cities in Shandong Strive to Eliminate the Four Pests This Year

According to a report in the Shandong Dazhong Daily, forty-four counties and cities in Shandong Province, under the premise of comparing drive, measures, and conditions, are determined to eliminate the four pests this year.

Shandong Province convened a provincial health administrative work conference in early February. The conference concentrated its efforts on studying the plan for carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign and eliminating local diseases in 1958, and also made specific arrangements for comprehensive health work. The heads of health departments, bureaus, epidemic prevention stations, and some hospital directors from various special districts and counties and cities attending the meeting, after repeated discussions and listening to Vice Governor Yu Xiu's report on "The Current Domestic and International Situation and the Tasks of Health Work," unanimously recognized the importance of health work serving production, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and resolved to, under the leadership of the Party Committee, bring out revolutionary vigor, vigorously organize the masses to eliminate the four pests and eradicate local diseases.

On the basis of ideological improvement, the attendees discussed the province's Patriotic Health Campaign plan and the plan to eliminate local diseases, and put forward preliminary plans based on the actual conditions of their respective regions. During the process of formulating plans, various special districts and counties and cities launched challenges and responded to challenges. Huimin first initiated a friendly competition with Tai'an and seven other special districts, with the condition that it would become a "Five Cleans and Four No's" special district in three years. Liaocheng Special District immediately responded to the challenge and challenged Heze Special District. Changwei Special District was unwilling to fall behind and proposed to achieve "Five Cleans and Four No's" in two years. Zibo City, which was full of dust, coal ash, and had decades of "garbage mountains," also wanted to realize "Five Cleans and Four No's" in two years. Yantai City was even more advanced, proposing to completely eliminate the four pests in one year. Under the premise of comparing drive, measures, and conditions, a total of forty-four counties and cities proposed to strive to basically achieve "Five Cleans and Four No's" this year. They are: Jinan City, Qingdao City, Yangxin, Leling, Qidong, Huimin, Zouping, Huantai, Boxing, Bin County, Jiyang, Linyi, Weifang City, Jiao County, Yidu, Weixian, Pingdu, Changle, Gaomi, Zhucheng, Changle, Linzi, Jimo, Laiyang, Fushan, Weihai City, Changdao County, Shan County, Cao County, Yuncheng, Juye, Dingtao, Gaotang, Pingyuan, Xiazjin, Dezhou City, Linqing City, Ningyang, Tai'an, Feicheng, Pingyin, Qufu, Sishui, and Tancheng.
