The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is a broad movement of criticizing backwardness and striving for advancement politically, ideologically, and economically. This movement confronts bureaucratism, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness. To defeat these five airs, we need their opposites: the revolutionary drive to strive for the upper reaches and catch up with the advanced.

Currently, it is this revolutionary drive that is propelling many units to launch a surging revolutionary competition to oppose waste and conservatism. Mutual visits and mutual comparisons, catching up with the advanced, and competing in enthusiasm have become not only a method for leading organs to mobilize the masses, but also a good way for leading cadres to defeat their own bureaucratism and lethargy and strive for an all-round leap forward. Leading cadres such as the ministers and bureau chiefs of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Chemical Industry have taken the lead in posting big-character posters exposing various serious phenomena of waste and conservatism, personally doing ideological and organizational work, and adopting various effective measures to eliminate obstacles in the movement and point out the direction of anti-waste and anti-conservatism. In these units, bureaucratism, lethargy, and all unhealthy trends have been strongly attacked, and the revolutionary spirit of stirring up enthusiasm and striving for the upper reaches has become the mainstream of organizational life.

In such a heart-stirring high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, some units are in a completely different situation, with big-character posters scattered and the atmosphere in the organization very inactive. The reason why these units use this generalized method to lead the movement is mostly because they do not sufficiently recognize the importance of taking anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the key link. They often only measure the significance of this movement from the size of the waste figures in terms of financial and material resources, feeling that the waste figures in their organizations are not large. They do not realize that as long as this key link is raised, all unhealthy trends in the organization can be defeated, the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results can be implemented, and a great leap forward in all work can be achieved. Without raising this key link, the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results cannot be well implemented, unhealthy trends cannot be defeated, and a great leap forward in work cannot be realized. The reason why a few comrades still do not feel this is because they still have bureaucratism and lethargy on them; with bureaucratism and lethargy, of course, they cannot lead the movement to defeat bureaucratism, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness.

The situation is pressing, and the opportunity cannot be missed. Whether a high tide can appear quickly depends on whether these units themselves can quickly sweep away bureaucratism and stir up enthusiasm.

    鼓起干劲反浪费
    本报评论员
    反浪费反保守运动是一个从政治上、思想上、经济上广泛地批判落后争取先进的运动。这次运动面对的是官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气，要打倒这五气，就需要他们的对立物：力争上游、赶上先进的革命干劲。
    目前，正是这种革命干劲推动着许多单位展开了汹涌澎湃的反浪费反保守的革命竞赛高潮。互相参观互相评比，赶先进比干劲已经不仅是领导机关发动群众的办法，同时也成为领导干部打倒自己的官气暮气争取全面跃进的好办法。冶金工业部、对外贸易部、化学工业部的部长、局司长等领导干部，都一马当先贴大字报揭发各种严重浪费保守现象，亲自动手做思想工作和组织工作，针对本单位的具体情况采取各种有效措施，消除运动中的障碍，指出反浪费反保守的方向。在这些单位中官风暮气一切歪风邪气受到了有力的打击，鼓起干劲力争上游的革命精神已经成为机关生活的主流。
    在这样震动人心的反浪费反保守的高潮中，有些单位却完全是另外一种情况，大字报零零落落，机关里的空气很不活跃。这些单位所以用这种一般化的办法来领导运动，大多因为他们对于以反浪费反保守为纲这一点认识不足。他们往往只从财力物力的浪费数字大小来估量这一运动的意义，感到他们机关的浪费数字不大。他们没有认识到只要提起这个纲，就能打倒机关中的一切歪风邪气，贯彻多快好省的方针，争取各项工作的大跃进。不提这个纲，多快好省的方针就不能很好地贯彻，邪气歪风就不能打倒，工作的大跃进就无从实现。少数同志所以还感觉不到这一点，就因为他们身上还有官气暮气；带着官气暮气，当然无法来领导打倒官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气的运动。
    形势逼人，时机不可错过，而高潮能否很快出现，还要看这些单位自己能不能很快地扫掉官气鼓起干劲。
