Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) issued on the 21st "Instructions on Political Work Regarding the Withdrawal of the CPV from Korea," requiring troops to ensure making friends well and leaving well, starting well and finishing well, troops withdraw, friendship endures, in the process of carrying out the task of withdrawing from Korea in batches.

    The instructions called on all officers and soldiers of the CPV to show the heroic spirit and leaping spirit of the people of the motherland in socialist construction, and to set off a high tide of labor for Sino-Korean friendship. In addition to the construction troops completing the construction tasks well, quickly and economically, the entire army should strive to over fulfill the CPV Party Committee's original plan of assisting the Korean people in increasing production and construction with 300,000 workdays this year by two or three times. Leaders of all units should take the initiative to contact the Korean side in the stationed area, select project items that are most beneficial and most urgently needed for the local people to increase production and improve their lives, formulate plans, concentrate time and manpower to carry them out, and firmly condense Sino-Korean friendship into these projects.

    The instructions required all officers and soldiers of the CPV to conduct a wide-ranging and in-depth discussion on the "Respect the Korean Government, Love the Korean People" covenant issued by the CPV Political Department last year, so as to launch mass mutual encouragement, supervision, and comparison, to ensure that no accidents that damage the interests of the Korean people occur before withdrawing from Korea, and maintain the honor of the CPV. In addition, a movement to learn from the Korean people and the People's Army should be launched throughout the army, and officers and soldiers should be organized to visit local cooperatives, factories, and mines in a planned way, send representatives to visit and learn from the People's Army, and organize in-depth communication and discussion, so that all troops can not only return with friendship when they withdraw from Korea, but also bring back all the strengths and advanced experiences learned from the Korean people and the People's Army.

    Regarding making friends well, the instructions emphasized ensuring that all fortifications, barracks, and equipment are handed over completely undamaged. Before leaving the station, a certain amount of manpower should be drawn to repair fortifications, barracks, and equipment, and clean the interior and exterior, and do a good job in receiving the People's Army's takeover troops. Through this extensive contact, a new upsurge of unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean armies will be set off. Before leaving the station, a major inspection should also be carried out in accordance with the "Respect the Korean Government, Love the Korean People" covenant, and seriously return borrowed items, compensate for damages, and apologize for impoliteness; each unit should also invite Korean residents in the station area to hold symposiums and ask them to put forward criticisms and opinions.

    The instructions finally requested cadres at all levels of the CPV to muster full revolutionary enthusiasm, take the highest political responsibility level by level, and successfully complete the major task of withdrawing troops and returning to the country, and live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland.

    指示号召志愿军全体官兵拿出像祖国人民在社会主义建设中的那种英雄气概和跃进精神，掀起一个为中朝友谊而劳动的高潮。除了施工部队要又好又快又省地完成施工任务外，全军要力争两倍三倍地超额完成志愿军党委原定的今年以三十万个劳动日协助朝鲜人民增产建设的计划。各部队领导要主动与驻区朝鲜方面联系，选择对当地人民增进生产、改善生活最有好处也最有紧迫需要的工程项目，订出计划，集中时间和人力去进行，把中朝友谊牢牢地凝结到这些工程中去。
    指示要求志愿军全体官兵对志愿军政治部去年发布的“尊重朝鲜政府、爱护朝鲜人民”公约，进行一次广泛深入的讨论，从而展开群众性的互相鼓励、监督与评比，保证在撤出朝鲜之前不发生任何一件有损朝鲜人民利益的事故，保持志愿军的荣誉。另外，还要在全军开展一个向朝鲜人民和人民军学习的运动，有计划地组织官兵访问当地合作社和工厂、矿山，派代表去人民军参观学习，组织深入的传达和讨论，使所有部队撤出朝鲜时不但能满载友谊而归，而且能把学到的朝鲜人民和人民军的一切长处和先进经验带回去。
    关于交好方面，指示强调要保证一切工事、营房、营具完整无损地移交。在离开驻地以前，应抽出一定人力，补修工事、营房和营具，并将室内外打扫干净，做好接待人民军接防部队的工作。通过这次广泛的接触，掀起一个中朝两国军队团结友谊的新高潮。在离开驻地以前，还要根据“尊重朝鲜政府、爱护朝鲜人民”公约进行一次大检查，认真做到借物送还，损坏赔偿，失礼道歉；各单位还要邀请驻地朝鲜居民开座谈会，请他们提出批评和意见。
    指示最后要求志愿军各级干部鼓起十足的革命干劲，以最高的政治责任心逐级负责，圆满地完成撤军返国的重大任务，不负祖国人民的期望。
