　　“Leeches Don’t Bite Diligent People”
    By the CCP Changning County Committee, Sichuan Province, Dai Baijun
    After reading the article “Leeches” published in the supplement of the People's Daily on January 17th, I recalled my experience participating in agricultural labor last summer, and I was deeply moved.

    “In July of last year, we responded to the call of the county committee and went to help agricultural cooperatives with harvesting and transplanting. But some comrades had a mental block: they were afraid of leeches. The paddy fields in Sichuan generally have leeches, and the fields in shady mountain gullies have even more. When the comrades took off their shoes and socks and rolled up their trousers, their feet were all white and tender, so how could they not be afraid of leeches? The more timid comrades kept asking which fields had many leeches and which fields didn't. They even joked: “Today, we're giving the leeches a foreign feast, a big treat!” After going into the fields, because we were amateurs at farm work, our efficiency was already very low; plus, we were afraid of leeches, and constantly lifted our feet to check, which made our movements even slower. Some comrades, even if they felt a blade of grass on their feet, suspected that a leech had latched on, and screamed in fright. Before long, someone would shout: "Ouch! A leech has sucked onto my leg!" Another would yell: "Two leeches on my leg!" The cries rose and fell, very lively. But the farmers working with us acted as if nothing was happening, not saying a word, just moving their feet quickly forward to cut and thresh the rice. Later, seeing that we were being bitten by leeches too "pitifully," they smiled and comforted us: "Leeches don't bite diligent people." This was indeed the case. Because we worked slowly and wiggled our feet slowly, the leeches had more opportunities to latch on; if we worked diligently like the farmers, moving our feet quickly, the leeches wouldn't easily latch on.

    In a few days, everyone's work efficiency improved, and leech bites became fewer and fewer, and later almost stopped. If anyone was working slowly in the fields, we would deliberately threaten them: "Hurry up! The leeches are going to bite you!" Leeches became our judge of whether we were diligent or lazy. Only a few extremely timid comrades would sometimes shout in their dreams: "Ah! Three leeches on my leg!"

　　“马蟥不咬勤快人”
    中共四川省长宁县委会　戴白君
    读了1月17日人民日报副刊登的“马蟥”一文，我回想起去年夏天参加农业劳动的情形，很有感触。
    “去年7月间。我们响应县委号召，前往帮助农业社收割和栽插。但有些同志思想上有个疙瘩，就是怕马蟥。原来四川地方的水田，大都有马蟥，阴山夹沟的田里更多。同志们把鞋袜一脱，裤脚一卷，都是又白又嫩的双脚，怎么不怕马蟥呢？胆子小的同志，不住地打听那块田马蟥多、那块田没有马蟥；还开玩笑说：“今天要给马蟥开开洋荤，打个大牙祭！”下田以后，因为做活是外行，效率本来已经很低；再加上怕马蟥，时时把脚提起来看看，因而动作更慢。有的同志那怕脚上碰上一根草，都疑心是马蟥吮上来了，吓得尖声叫起来。不多一会儿，这里喊：“啊唷！我的腿上吸上了一条马蟥！”那里嚷：“我的腿上两条马蟥！”喊声此落彼起，十分热闹。可是同我们一起做活的农民，却没事人一般，一声不吭，只是两脚不停地很快向前移动割谷打谷。后来看到我们被马蟥咬得太“可怜”了，才含笑地安慰我们说：“马蟥不咬勤快人”。确实是这样，因为做活慢、两脚扭动得慢，马蟥吸上的机会就多；如果像农民那样一个劲儿向前干、两脚扭动得快，马蟥就不容易吸上来。
    不几天，大家干活的效率提高了，马蟥吸人的事就越来越少，后来几乎没有被咬的了。谁要是在田里慢腾腾的干活，我们就故意威吓他：“加把劲呀！马蟥要来咬你了！”马蟥成了我们干活勤或懒的鉴定者了。只有个别极胆小的同志，有时还会在梦中喊道：“啊呀！我腿上三条马蟥！”
