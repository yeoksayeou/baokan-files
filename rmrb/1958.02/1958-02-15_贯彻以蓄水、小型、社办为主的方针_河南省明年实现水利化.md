Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 13th: Henan Province, possessing 136 million mu of cultivated land, has decided to achieve water conservancy in the coming year.

The target for expanding irrigated land originally set by Henan Province has been repeatedly surpassed. In less than three months, the province has expanded its irrigated area by 23.41 million mu. This figure is more than twice the area of watered land developed over the past several thousand years before liberation. Various water conservancy projects currently under construction or about to commence throughout the province are expected to benefit an area of approximately 16 million mu. All of these projects can be completed before the wheat harvest. Thus, adding the water conservancy facilities developed before October of last year, the province's watered land area will expand to over 80 million mu. The Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently analyzed this new situation of a great leap forward in water conservancy, believing that Henan is fully capable of achieving water conservancy on over 100 million mu of cultivated land in the coming year.

The labor force投入into the movement across the province reaches 15 million people every day. In the Taihang Mountains, Funiu Mountains, and Tongbai Mountain areas, red flags flutter in the daytime, and lights shine everywhere at night. Millions of mountain farmers, braving the severe cold, are splitting mountains and filing stones, building gully dams, ponds, small reservoirs, fish-scale pits, and terraced fields on mountain tops and in ravines day and night, intercepting water at every level to ensure that soil does not leave the mountains and water does not leave the valleys.

Another characteristic of Henan's water conservancy movement is that various localities, through extensive debates, have specifically implemented the water conservancy construction policy of focusing on water storage, small-scale projects, and commune management. In the plains and low-lying waterlogged areas of Xuchang, Kaifeng, Shangqiu, and Nanyang, the past water conservancy policies were not clear enough, and emphasis was placed on underground water extraction and drainage. As a result, some places suffered disasters every year despite building water conservancy projects, and the more drainage they did, the more serious the disasters became. This year, after extensive debates and accounting of water resources, people recognized the benefits of storing water, and decided to divide rivers into small sections, using methods such as digging ditches, canals, and river networks to divert river water for irrigation and drainage during floods. In areas without rivers, measures such as digging pits and ponds, tapping underground springs, raising roadbeds, and building enclosed fields and platform fields are being taken to control flood runoff, striving to achieve water conservancy in the spring of next year ahead of schedule.

Henan Yuxian Chenzhuang Township is building a "Happiness" reservoir. After its completion, this reservoir can hold 47,000 cubic meters of water, irrigating more than 700 mu of land, creating extremely favorable conditions for the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958.

### 贯彻以蓄水、小型、社办为主的方针  河南省明年实现水利化

    贯彻以蓄水、小型、社办为主的方针
    河南省明年实现水利化
    据新华社郑州13日电　拥有耕地面积一亿三千六百万亩的河南省，决定明年实现水利化。
    河南省原来制定的扩大水浇地的指标，已经一再被突破。不到三个月，全省已扩大灌溉面积二千三百四十一万亩。这个数字比解放前几千年来开辟的水地面积还多两倍多。各地目前正在动工或将要动工兴办的各种水利工程，效益面积约达一千六百多万亩。这批工程麦收前就可以全部完工。这样，加上去年10月份以前发展的水利设施，全省水地面积将扩大到八千多万亩。中共河南省委常务委员会最近分析了这种水利大跃进的新形势，认为河南明年在一亿多亩的耕地上实现水利化是完全有条件的。
    全省每天投入运动的劳动力达一千五百万人。在太行山、伏牛山和桐柏山区，目前白天红旗招展，夜晚遍地一片灯火，数以百万计的山区农民，冒着严寒，在山顶上、沟壑中，日日夜夜地劈山、锉石，修筑谷坊、水塘、小水库、鱼鳞坑和梯田，节节拦水，做到土不下山，水不出川。
    河南水利化运动的另一个特点是，各地通过大辩论，具体贯彻执行了以蓄为主，以小型为主，以社办为主的水利建设方针。许昌、开封、商丘、南阳等平原地区和低洼易涝地带，过去兴修水利方针不够明确，偏重于地下提水和排水，结果有些地方年年办水利，年年遭灾，越排水灾越严重。今年，这些地区经过大辩论，查算水账，人们认识了水蓄起来的好处，就决定把河道分割成小片，用挖沟、渠、河网等办法，引用河水灌溉，涝时排水；没有河道的地方，采取挖坑塘，塘内下泉，抬高路基，修围田、台田等措施，控制洪水径流，力争明年春季提前实现水利化。（附图片）
