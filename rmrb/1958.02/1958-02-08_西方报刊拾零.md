Western Press Clippings

    They Really Thought It Through
    American missile scientists have clearly benefited from the experience of their Soviet counterparts in launching "Sputnik." In particular, they have noticed that the Soviet announcement that the second satellite contained a live dog caused an uproar around the world. Therefore, it is said that the first American Earth satellite will only carry a simple life form, most likely a cultured yeast cell.
    Whether this can provide biological response information as well as a mammal is highly doubtful. But Washington authorities believe this is the only way to avoid offending organized animal lovers.
            — Canadian "The Globe and Mail"

    American Culture
    The American Library in Paris (129 Avenue des Champs-Élysées) has recently received a batch of new books:
    "Death in the Family" by James Agee, "The Brain Pickers" by Harry Benneret, "Midnight Rave" by Don Delisi…
            — Paris edition of the American "New York Herald Tribune"

    Making a Fuss Over Nothing
    Sometimes, people find it very strange how some people can put the title of "Reverend" before their names.
    Reverend James Cole is one example. He is a Ku Klux Klan member whose rally in Robeson County, North Carolina, was broken up by the Lumbee Indians. The devoted Reverend Cole has a record of drunkenness and assault in the police files of his hometown of Lenoir County. As for the files elsewhere, there is no readily available material.
    It is absurd that Mr. Cole became a pastor, but his resume shows that he is competent to be a KKK leader, and he is fully qualified for this role, but the title of "Reverend" is disgusting.

    亏他们想得周到
    美国的导弹科学家们显然从他们的苏联同行发射“斯普特尼克”的经验中得到好处。特别是他们已经注意到，苏联宣布第二颗卫星里装有一只活狗引起了世界各地的叫嚷。因此，据说美国第一颗地球卫星将只携带一种简单的生命，很可能是一种人工培养的酵母细胞。
    这样做能不能像哺乳动物一样地提供生物反应的情报，是大可怀疑的。但是，华盛顿当局认为这是避免触怒有组织的动物宠爱者的唯一办法。

    美国文化
    巴黎美国图书馆（香榭丽舍一百二十九号路）最近到了一批新书：
    詹姆斯·阿基著“家庭中的命案”，哈里·本勒特著“挖脑浆的人”，唐·德莱西著“半夜狂潮”……

    少见多怪
    有时候，人们感到很奇怪，有一些人怎么能在他们的名字前冠上“牧师”的称号。
    詹姆士·柯尔牧师就是一个例子，他是三K党徒，他在北卡罗来纳州罗伯逊县召集的集会被兰比族的印第安人打散了。献身担任牧师的柯尔先生，在他的家乡连诺尔县的警察局档案中有着他酗酒和殴打罪行记录。至于别的地方的档案手头没有现成材料。
    那位柯尔先生居然成了牧师是非常荒谬的，但是他的履历倒表明他胜任三K党头目，他当这种角色是完全合适的，但是“牧师”的称号却使人作呕。
