Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 15th. The President of the Union of Burma, U Win Maung, held a state banquet on the evening of February 14th in honor of the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh.

    The Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, as well as the Chief Justice of the Union, the Speakers of the House of Representatives and the House of Nationalities, the Deputy Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Burma were invited to attend the banquet.

    In his speech at the banquet, U Win Maung said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit to the Union of Burma would be a milestone in the growing mutual understanding between the peoples of Burma and Vietnam.

    U Win Maung said that since Prime Minister U Nu's visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1954 and the then Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong's visit to Burma, the friendly relations between the two countries have become even closer. Burma and Vietnam have also established consular relations. He said, "Therefore, we have made significant progress in eliminating the unnatural barriers that colonialism has created between us, and we are looking forward to completely eliminating these barriers."

    U Win Maung said that Burma and Vietnam firmly believe that sincerely pursuing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence among all nations will help ease international tensions and create an atmosphere conducive to countries settling their disputes. He said that Burma and Vietnam agree that efforts should continue to be made to encourage all countries to accept the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    In his speech, Ho Chi Minh said that Vietnam and Burma have a long history of relations, and in the common struggle against colonialism and in safeguarding world peace, they have become closer to each other, and both countries endorse and practice the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said, "That is why we are so close to each other and fully understand each other."

    Ho Chi Minh once again thanked the Burmese government and people for their support to the Vietnamese people in resisting aggression and for their contribution to the restoration of peace in Vietnam.

    Ho Chi Minh said that although Vietnam has not yet been unified due to foreign intervention, with the support of the Burmese people and peace-loving people all over the world, the Vietnamese people's struggle for national reunification will surely be victorious.

    两国元首强调增进友好关系
    新华社仰光15日电　缅甸联邦总统吴温貌2月14日晚举行国宴招待越南民主共和国主席胡志明。
    缅甸联邦总理吴努以及联邦首席法官、国会代表院和民族院的议长、内阁副总理和各部部长、各国驻缅甸的外交使节等都应邀出席了宴会。
    吴温貌在宴会上致词说，胡志明主席访问缅甸联邦，将成为缅甸和越南两国人民之间日益互相了解的一个里程碑。
    吴温貌说，自从1954年吴努总理访问越南民主共和国以及当时的越南民主共和国副总理范文同访问缅甸以来，两国之间的友好关系已经变得更加密切。缅甸和越南也建立了领事关系。他说，“因此，我们在消除殖民主义在我们之间建立的非自然的障碍上，我们已经取得了显著的进展，我们正在瞻望着完全把这些障碍消除”。
    吴温貌说，缅甸和越南坚定地相信，真诚地在各个国家之间奉行和平共处的五项原则，将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和制造一种有利于各国平息它们的纷争的气氛。他说，缅甸和越南一致认为，应该继续尽力促使所有国家都接受和平共处五项原则。
    胡志明在致词中说，越南和缅甸有悠久的关系，在反对殖民主义的共同斗争以及在维护世界和平中，它们彼此之间更加接近，两国都赞成和奉行和平共处五项原则。他说，“这就是为什么我们是如此地彼此亲近和彼此充分了解的原故”。
    胡志明再一次感谢缅甸政府和人民对越南人民抵抗侵略的支持以及在恢复越南和平方面的贡献。
    胡志明说，虽然由于外国的干预使得越南还不能统一，但是，有了缅甸人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，越南人民的争取国家统一的斗争一定会胜利。
