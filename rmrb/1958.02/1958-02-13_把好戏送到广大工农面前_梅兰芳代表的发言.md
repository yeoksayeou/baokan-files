I wholeheartedly endorse the various reports of the conference and the speeches of the representatives. I heard Representative Qian Junrui's speech the day before yesterday, in which he talked about some problems existing in the drama circle, and I completely agree. I am a Peking Opera actor and would like to say a few words about opera:

Opera actors were oppressed and despised in the old society, as evidenced by the experience of the highly respected Cheng Changgeng; but today, opera workers have participated in the government, received care, and have successors; the Rightists' fallacy that "the present is not as good as the past" has completely gone bankrupt.

Everyone knows that opera actors were oppressed and despised in the old society. But the Rightists insisted on saying that "the present is not as good as the past," indirectly slandering the opera cause since liberation as having no achievements, and the actors as not being valued, leading to poverty, sorrow, and tears. This kind of upside-down, fact-obliterating nonsense once caused ideological confusion among some people in the opera circle. Today, I would also like to compare the persecution suffered by actors in the old society with the honor and status they have gained since liberation, to clarify right and wrong.

Our predecessor, Mr. Cheng Changgeng, was one of the founders of Peking Opera a hundred years ago. His supreme artistic achievements and excellent and simple moral qualities are still respected by the opera circle today. When he was in charge of the Sanqing Troupe, in order to maintain the livelihood of all the members of the troupe, he stipulated a troupe rule: if there were outside invitations to perform at private banquets, the Sanqing Troupe's base must be used, and no solo invitations could be made to the troupe's good actors to perform outside. Once, at a group worship ceremony at the Censorate, he was invited to sing a play alone, but the base used was the Sixi Troupe. Mr. Cheng refused to go. An official who knew him sent someone to call him, but he still did not go. The official then arrested him and locked him next to the stage. Someone advised him not to be so stubborn and to suffer in the short term. He said, "If I sing this time, I will have to sing other outside performances in the future; if I earn money alone, I will be letting down the brothers of Sanqing, so I would rather be humiliated than make an exception." This incident is enough to illustrate the oppression of artists by the ruling class. Mr. Cheng had the highest prestige in the opera circle in the old society, yet he was subjected to such persecution, let alone others.

From the end of the Qing Dynasty until before liberation, there were countless actors all over the country who sang for a lifetime but could not get enough to eat or wear. Some old artists who had once enjoyed great fame were destitute in their later years and even died of poverty and starvation with no one to care for them. These are all facts that everyone knows. As for the fact that artists in old China had no social status and were despised and ridiculed, it goes without saying.

Now, let's look at today after liberation. How does the Party and the People's Government treat us? First of all, opera workers have participated in the government and become People's Representatives and CPPCC members. This is unprecedented.

Artists all over the country have been given appropriate arrangements, and even some old artists who have lost their ability to work have received care in their lives. In 1956 and 1957, the Central People's Government also allocated special funds to relieve and subsidize artists in various places.

In order to cultivate the next generation, the government has also established opera schools in various places, and the students' living conditions—food and housing—are very good.

The Chinese Academy of Opera, under the Ministry of Culture, holds actor training classes every year, which have improved the artistic level and moral character of the actors.

Quite a few opera actors who came from the old society were illiterate or semi-literate. After the government launched a literacy campaign in the opera circle, the vast majority of them can now read newspapers, write letters, and copy scripts, and their cultural level has improved.

What is particularly worth mentioning is that the Party, through political and ideological leadership, through study sessions and listening to reports, has greatly raised the class consciousness of opera workers in various places. Due to the attention of the government and the people, grand celebrations of the stage life were also held for Mr. Xiao Changhua, Gai Jiaotian, Zhou Xinfang, and myself. In recent years, many troupes have been able to perform Chinese opera art on stages around the world, conduct cultural exchanges with people from various countries, and have gained international reputation. All of these are glories that our ancestors could not have dreamed of.

From the above comparison of the two societies, the facts are before us, and the Rightists' fallacy that "the present is not as good as the past" has completely gone bankrupt.

The opera cause must now catch up quickly, cooperate with the development of industry and agriculture, and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In this anti-Rightist struggle, we have won a great victory. At present, the enthusiasm for industry and agriculture is rising all over the country. Our opera cause must, of course, catch up quickly to cooperate with the development of industry and agriculture and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao told us: "We are doing things that our predecessors have never done." I believe that our cultural construction upsurge will not lag behind either.

So, what should we do in the opera circle in the future? I personally believe that we must proceed from the following two points:

Run troupes diligently and frugally, and overcome waste.

In 1935, when I first went to perform in the Soviet Union, Mr. Nemirovich-Danchenko said to me: "After watching Chinese opera, I feel that it conforms to the principle of 'stage economy.'" What he referred to as "stage economy" included the time, space, costumes, props, etc. of the entire performing art. His words gave me great inspiration. Originally, our traditional opera paid the most attention to the performing art on the stage, and everything used on the stage was required to be economical and durable, and to serve the performance. Take costumes as an example. We pay attention to the identity of the characters in the play and what kind of costumes they wear. The predecessors had an old saying: "Rather wear torn clothes than wear the wrong clothes." For example, if a female character makes a "yellow robe," she can wear it to play the empress of any dynasty. As long as a troupe prepares a set of opera trunks, they can carry it from city to countryside and perform any play, and go anywhere. In recent years, there has been a tendency of extravagance and waste in this regard. Some national troupes often do not carefully study the identity and character of the characters in the play, but like to come up with new costumes on their own. These costumes have only been worn a few times, or even not at all, and then lie at the bottom of the box, never to be seen, resulting in a large backlog of costumes. When rehearsing new plays, it is okay to make scenery, but some troupes often create a luxurious scenery, or design a batch of dedicated costumes and props, the purpose of which is just to show off, flaunt wealth, and blindly pursue the so-called "truth" in art. This kind of unrealistic style violates the principle of "stage economy." I think that the reason for the above situations is that, on the one hand, some opera workers unilaterally emphasize artistic effects, and are generous with public funds, and do not pay attention to careful calculation; on the other hand, individual leaders in the troupe support this practice, fostering the arrogance and squeamishness of some actors, reflecting the bureaucracy of the leadership. It can be seen from this that there is a common problem between them, that is, a frivolous attitude towards art. If this continues to develop, it will not only waste state funds, but more seriously, it will lead the performing arts to gradually decline. This tendency must be corrected and prevented.

Perform more good plays and enrich the repertoire.

During the fourth session of the National People's Congress, seven representatives from the opera circle jointly issued a proposal to oppose bad plays and perform more good plays, which was enthusiastically responded to by the majority of actors. In the past six months, with the joint efforts of everyone, although there are still individual performances that have not been thorough enough, generally speaking, bad plays have basically been stopped, which is a good phenomenon. Here, I hope that all comrades in the opera circle will make further efforts.

Now, although bad plays can no longer stand on the stage, we have not done enough in performing more good plays. We have already excavated more than 50,000 traditional repertoires. I think there will not be too few that we can use from this rich and colorful legacy. I hope that comrades in the opera circle will select, sort out, and adapt them more, and there will be great achievements. In addition, some operas are suitable for performing repertoires related to modern life, and have accumulated a lot of experience in this area. This is a valuable new force in our opera circle. We should actively develop and continue to move forward.

In today's new upsurge of industrial and agricultural development, thousands of intellectuals are responding to the Party's call to go to the countryside and grassroots to participate in labor production, boosting revolutionary enthusiasm. Many people in our opera circle are also going to the mountains and rural areas with revolutionary enthusiasm, bringing good plays to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and enriching the cultural and recreational life of rural mines. Through personal experience, not only can we learn the excellent qualities of the broad masses of workers and peasants, but also obtain materials from real life to write good scripts to enrich our performing repertoire. At the same time, it will also be of great help in our ideological transformation.

Finally, I would also like to say that although the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre, which I lead, has completed many tasks and achieved some achievements in recent years, the backlog and waste of manpower and materials are also quite serious, which is of course caused by bureaucratic style. In this rectification movement, through full airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, many problems have been discovered. We are currently reviewing the team, inventorying materials, prescribing the right medicine, and removing the roots of the disease. I guarantee that I will definitely work hard to improve in the future and welcome the great Second Five-Year Plan with a new look!

If there is anything wrong with what I have said above, please give me criticisms and corrections.

### 把好戏送到广大工农面前  梅兰芳代表的发言

专栏：

    把好戏送到广大工农面前
    梅兰芳代表的发言
    我衷心拥护大会的各项报告和各位代表的发言。我前天又听到了钱俊瑞代表的发言，其中谈到了戏剧界存在的一些问题，我完全同意。我是一个京剧演员，想对戏曲方面讲几句话：
    戏曲演员在旧社会受压迫被轻视，名望很高的程长庚的遭遇就是明证；而今天，戏曲工作者参加了政权，得到了照顾，后继有人；右派分子的今不如昔的谬论完全破产。
    谁都知道，戏曲演员在旧社会里是受压迫、被轻视的。而右派分子却偏说“今不如昔”，转湾抹角地诬蔑解放以来，戏曲事业毫无成就，对演员不重视，以致穷愁潦倒、老泪纵横。这种颠倒是非、抹杀事实的怪话，当时曾在戏曲界一度引起某些人思想上的混乱。今天我还想把演员在旧社会所遭受的迫害，与解放以后得到的荣誉和地位，两下对比一下，弄清是非。
    我们的前辈程长庚老先生在一百年前是京剧创始人之一，他在艺术上登峰造极的成就，道德上优良朴素的品质，至今为戏曲界所尊敬。在他管领三庆班的时候，为了维持全班同业的生计，定有这样一条班规：外边如约堂会，必须用三庆班底，不得单约本班好角外串。有一次都察院团拜，单约他去唱一出戏，用的却是四喜班的班底，程老先生不去，有一个和他认识的御史，派人去叫他，他还是不到，这个御史就把他拘捕到场，锁在戏台旁边。有人劝他何必这样固执，吃眼前亏。他说：“我若唱这一回，以后别的外串，我就不能不唱；我一人得钱，对不起三庆众弟兄，所以宁可受辱，决不破例。”这件事已经足够说明统治阶级对艺人的压迫。程老先生在旧社会戏曲界是威望最高的，尚且受到这样的迫害，别人就不必说了。
    从清末一直到解放前，国内各地演员，唱了一辈子的戏而吃不饱、穿不暖的人，是屈指难数的。有些曾享过盛名的老艺人，晚年潦倒，甚至于穷饿而死没人管。这都是大家所知道的事实。至于艺人在旧中国，没有社会地位，受人轻视耻笑的情况，更不用说了。
    现在，我们再看看解放以后的今天，党和人民政府是怎样对待我们的呢？首先是戏曲工作者参加了政权，做了人民代表、政协委员。这是史无前例的事情。
    全国各地的艺人都得到适当的安排，就是一些失去工作能力的老艺人，也受到了生活上的照顾。一九五六、一九五七年，中央人民政府还特别拨出专款救济和补助各地的艺人。
    为了培养下一代，政府还在各地举办了戏曲学校，学生的生活条件——吃的、住的都很好。
    文化部所属的中国戏曲研究院，每年举办演员讲习班，提高了演员的艺术水平和道德修养。
    从旧社会过来的戏曲演员，文盲、半文盲是相当多的，经过政府对戏曲界展开扫盲运动以后，绝大多数已能看报、写信、抄剧本，他们的文化水平提高了。
    特别值得提起的，是党在政治思想领导方面，通过学习会和听报告等等方式，使各地戏曲工作者大大提高了阶级觉悟。由于政府和人民的重视，还为萧长华、盖叫天、周信芳诸位先生和我隆重地举办了舞台生活纪念。几年来，不少剧团能够在世界各国舞台上表演中国戏曲艺术，与各国人民进行文化交流，得到了国际上的声誉。所有这些都是我们祖先所梦想不到的光荣。
    从上面新旧两种社会的对比，事实摆在我们面前，右派分子今不如昔的谬论就完全破产。
    戏曲事业现在必须急起直追，配合工农业的发展，更好地为工农兵服务。
    在这次反右派斗争中，我们已获得了伟大的胜利。目前工业、农业热火朝天的干劲，在全国普遍高涨，我们戏曲事业，当然也必须急起直追以配合工农业的发展，更好地为工农兵服务。毛主席告诉我们：“我们正在做前人所没有做过的事情。”我相信，我们的文化建设高潮，也是不会落后的。
    那么，我们戏曲界今后应该怎么做呢？我个人认为必须从以下两点着手进行：
    勤俭办团、克服浪费
    一九三五年我第一次到苏联演出，聂米洛维奇·丹钦科老先生对我说：“我看了中国戏，感觉到合乎‘舞台经济’的原则。”他所指的“舞台经济”是包括全部表演艺术的时间、空间和服装、道具等等在内的。他的话给了我很大的启发。本来我们的传统戏曲，最注重舞台上的表演艺术，至于舞台上所使用的一切东西，都要求经济耐用，为表演服务。就拿服装来说，我们讲究的是什么剧中人的身份，穿什么样的服装，前辈们有句老话：“宁穿破，不穿错。”譬如旦角做了一件“黄帔”，演任何朝代的后妃都可以穿。一个戏班，只要制备了一份戏箱，从城市到乡村带着跑，什么戏都可以演，什么地方都可以去。近几年来，在这方面是存在着一种铺张浪费的倾向的。有些国家剧团往往不仔细研究剧中人的身份、性格，喜欢独出心裁，添制新的服装，这些服装却只穿过几次，甚至一次也没有穿，就让它躺在箱底里，永不见人，造成服装的大量积压。在排演新戏的时候，做布景原是可以的，但有些剧团往往搞一堂奢华的布景，或者设计一批专用的服装道具，其目的不过是讲排场、摆阔气、盲目地追求所谓艺术上的“真实”。这种不切合实际的作风，是违背“舞台经济”原则的。我认为，所以造成以上这些情况的原因，一方面有些戏曲工作者片面强调艺术效果，慷公家之慨，不注意精打细算；另一方面，在剧团个别领导上支持了这种做法，助长了某些演员的骄气和娇气，反映了领导上存在着官气。从这里可以看出，他们之间有一个共同的毛病，那就是对待艺术的轻率态度。这样发展下去，不仅浪费国家资金，更严重的是将会引导表演艺术逐渐走向衰退的道路，这种倾向我们是必须加以纠正和防止的。
    多演好戏，丰富剧目
    在全国人代大会第四次会议期间，我们戏曲界七位代表联名发表了一个反对坏戏，多演好戏的建议，得到了广大演员同志的热烈响应。半年来，在大家共同努力之下，各地演出的剧目虽然还有个别做得不够彻底，但总的说来，基本上已经停演了坏戏，这是一种好的现象，在这里，我希望戏曲界全体同志再做进一步的努力。
    现在，坏戏虽然已经在舞台上站不住脚了，但在多演好戏方面，我们做得还是不够的。我们已经挖掘出五万多个传统剧目，在这一笔丰富多采的遗产里面，可供我们采用的，我想是不会太少的，希望戏曲界同志们多多加以选择、整理和改编，一定会有很大的成就。另外，有些剧种适合演出有关现代生活的剧目，并且已在这方面积累了不少的经验，这是我们戏曲界一支宝贵的新生力量，我们应该积极发挥，继续前进。
    在今天工农业发展的新高潮中，成千上万的知识分子响应党的号召，到农村和基层去参加劳动生产，鼓起了革命干劲。我们戏曲界也已经有不少的人怀着革命热情，纷纷地上山下乡，把好戏送到广大工农群众面前，丰富农村工矿的文娱生活。通过亲身的体验，不但可以学习到广大工农群众的优良品质，还会从实际生活中取得素材，编写出好的剧本，以丰富我们的上演剧目。同时，在我们的思想改造上也是有很大帮助的。
    最后，我还要说，就是我领导的中国京剧院，这几年来，虽然完成了不少任务，有了一些成就，但在人力物力的积压浪费上，也是相当严重的，这当然是官僚主义作风所造成的。在这次整风运动中，通过大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报，发现许多问题，目前正在检点队伍，清查物资，对症下药，拔除病根，我保证今后一定努力改进，以新的面貌来迎接伟大的第二个五年计划！
    以上所说，如有不对的地方，请诸位代表予以批评、指正。
