	Hurry to the Masses!

	Jiangsu Province's original plan to eliminate drought and flood disasters in three years will be completed in two years ahead of schedule. This is a great leap forward! If all provinces can eliminate drought and flood disasters one year, or even two or three years… ahead of schedule, and realize national water conservancy earlier, then our situation of "relying on the heavens for food" in agricultural production will be fundamentally changed.

	The fact that Jiangsu Province will eliminate drought and flood disasters ahead of schedule tells us that as long as the leadership is good at relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, all tasks can be completed ahead of schedule.

	The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee convened meetings in different regions under different conditions, and through visits and studies, earnestly summarized the experiences of the local masses in building water conservancy projects. This enabled cadres in different regions to clarify the water management policy, find water management methods, and increase their confidence in water management, and they automatically added tasks, setting off a new upsurge in the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy. This is a successful leadership method. The primary responsibility of leaders is to promptly help the masses summarize their experiences, elevate the experiences created by the masses in one place and at one time, draw general guidelines and methods from them, and enable those good experiences and methods to blossom and bear fruit in a wider area and scope.

	In the high tide of socialist construction, the masses in various places have many extraordinary creations. I hope that those leading cadres who are still sitting in their offices giving orders will hurry to the masses!

    赶快到群众中去！
    江苏省原订三年消灭旱涝灾害的规划，将提前在两年内完成。这是一个大跃进！如果各省都能提前一年，甚至两年、三年……消灭旱涝灾害，提早实现全国水利化，那么我们在农业生产上“靠天吃饭”的局面就会从根本上改变了。
    江苏省将提前消灭旱涝灾害的事实告诉我们，只要领导善于依靠群众，发动群众，一切任务都能提前实现。
    中共江苏省委在不同条件的地区分片召开会议，通过参观和研究，认真地总结了当地群众兴修水利工程的经验，使不同地区的干部明确了治水方针，找到了治水办法，提高了治水信心，自动追加了任务，掀起了兴修小型农田水利的新高潮。这是一个成功的领导方法。领导者的首要责任，本来就在于及时地帮助群众总结经验，把一时一地群众所创造的经验提高一步，从中提出一般性的方针和办法，并使那些好的经验和办法能在更广大的地区和范围内开花结果。
    在社会主义建设高潮中，各地群众都有许多非凡的创举。希望那些还坐在办公室里发号施令的领导干部，赶快到群众中去吧！
