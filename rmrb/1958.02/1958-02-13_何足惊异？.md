    Notes

    The Tunisian government's decision to prohibit French warships from entering the port of Bizerte in northern Tunisia, in the words of the French Minister of Defense, is Tunisia's "legitimate act of self-defense." However, diplomatic observers in Paris deliberately expressed surprise at this, because they reportedly believed that "there is no natural connection between the events on the Algeria-Tunisia border and the situation in the port of Bizerte, located in the Mediterranean."

    This reaction from the French diplomatic community is what is truly surprising. Does being slapped on the left cheek mean one shouldn't protect their right cheek? Moreover, French Prime Minister Félix Gaillard has openly threatened that French troops will continue to "retaliate" against Tunisia.

    As for "natural connections," this is common sense that French diplomats should possess: both the port of Bizerte and the village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef are inviolable Tunisian territories. What "natural connection" does a peaceful village on the Tunisian border have with France, across the Mediterranean? This is what the French diplomats need to be asked.

### 何足惊异？

    何足惊异？
    突尼斯政府禁止法国军舰开进突尼斯北部的比塞大港的决定，借用法国国防部长的话说，乃是突尼斯的“正当的自卫行动”。但是，巴黎的外交观察家却故意对此表示惊异，因为据说他们认为：“在阿尔及利亚—突尼斯边界上发生的事件和位于地中海的比塞大港的情况之间并没有什么自然的联系。”
    法国外交界的这种反应才是令人惊异的。难道一个人左脸挨了打就不应该保护自己的右脸？况且法国总理盖伊阿已公开威胁说：法国军队还要继续对突尼斯“进行报复”。
    至于谈到“自然的联系”，这是法国外交家应该有的常识：比塞大港和萨基埃特村都同样是突尼斯不容侵犯的国土。突尼斯边界上的和平村庄同在地中海彼岸的法国有什么“自然联系”呢？这倒是需要问问法国的外交家们的。
