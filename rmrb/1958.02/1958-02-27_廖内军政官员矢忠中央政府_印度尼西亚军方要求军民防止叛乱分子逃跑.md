Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: The Indonesian Ministry of Information announced on the 25th that the military and political officials of the Riau Islands, located in eastern Central Sumatra, stated today that they are loyal to the central government and will not participate in the treasonous activities of the Hussein group.

The Indonesian cabinet decided at a meeting on the evening of the 24th to appoint Amin as the temporary acting governor of Riau Province. The Ministry of Information said that the Riau military authorities had discussed this decision with local government civil servants and social figures. They issued a statement after the meeting saying that the people of the Riau Islands will always be loyal to the central government and will not participate in the activities of the Hussein group.

The Indonesian central authorities decided last year to change the Riau Islands into a province, thus dividing Central Sumatra into three provinces: West Sumatra Province, Riau Province, and Jambi Province. The Hussein rebel group is entrenched in West Sumatra, with Padang and Bukittinggi as its centers.

The Indonesian military authorities announced on the 25th that there are indications that rebels such as Hussein, Sjafruddin, and Simbolon may flee abroad. Therefore, the military authorities are asking the people and soldiers to assist in preventing these rebels from escaping.

The Army News Service pointed out in a broadcast that the Hussein rebel group had engaged in large-scale arms smuggling and deposited the huge sums obtained from smuggling in foreign countries. The rebels believe that foreign subversives support them, so they refuse to negotiate under various pretexts and believe that their conspiracy is ripe. Therefore, the government has to take measures against these rebels.

The Indonesian government's Ministry of Information and the Army News Service pointed out that Hussein and Sjafruddin have already or are preparing to move their families to Singapore and other places abroad. It is reported that the Jakarta military authorities searched the residences of Sjafruddin, Harahap, Sumitro, and Lubis in Jakarta on the 23rd, and seized a batch of important documents and weapons from Lubis's residence. All rebel residences have been sealed.

The Indonesian Air Force Command announced on the evening of the 25th that Air Force aircraft sank a ferry on the Kampar River southwest of Pekanbaru, Central Sumatra, on the 24th, thereby cutting off the connection between Padang and Pekanbaru.

It is reported that Pekanbaru is the center of foreign oil enterprises in Central Sumatra. Transportation between Padang and Pekanbaru mainly relies on highways. Since there are no bridges, ferries are the main means of transportation across the Kampar River.

    廖内军政官员矢忠中央政府
    印度尼西亚军方要求军民防止叛乱分子逃跑
    据新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚情报部25日宣布，位于中苏门答腊东部的廖内群岛的军政官员，今天表示他们效忠中央政府，不参加侯赛尼集团的叛国活动。
    印度尼西亚内阁在24日晚上的会议上决定任命阿明为廖内省临时代理省长。情报部说，廖内军事当局曾经同当地政府文职人员和社会名流讨论了这个决定。他们在会后发表声明说，廖内群岛人民将永远效忠中央政府，不参加侯赛尼集团的活动。
    印度尼西亚中央当局在去年曾经决定把廖内群岛改为省，这样中苏门答腊就分为三个省，即：西苏门答腊省、廖内省和占碑省。侯赛尼叛乱集团盘踞在西苏门答腊，以巴东和武吉丁宜为中心。
    印度尼西亚军事当局在25日宣布，有迹象表明，侯赛尼、沙弗鲁丁和宋巴等叛乱分子可能逃往外国，因此军事当局要求人民和士兵给予协助，以防止这些叛乱分子逃跑。
    陆军新闻处在广播中指出，侯赛尼叛乱集团进行了大规模的军火走私，并且把走私得来的巨额款项存放在外国。叛乱分子认为外国颠覆分子是支持他们的，因此他们以各种借口拒绝协商，并且认为他们的阴谋已经成熟。因此，政府不得不对这些叛乱分子采取措施。
    印度尼西亚政府情报部和陆军新闻处指出，侯赛尼和沙弗鲁丁已经或者准备把他们的家属迁移到新加坡和国外其他地方去。据悉，雅加达军事当局在23日搜查了沙弗鲁丁、哈拉哈普、苏米特罗和卢比斯等人在雅加达的住宅，在卢比斯的住宅中搜出了一批重要文件和武器。所有叛乱分子的住宅都已经被查封。
    印度尼西亚空军司令部25日晚宣布，空军飞机在24日击沉了中苏门答腊北甘巴鲁西南部甘巴河上的渡船，从而切断了巴东同北甘巴鲁之间的联系。
    据报道，北甘巴鲁是中苏门答腊的外国石油企业中心。巴东同北甘巴鲁之间的交通主要依靠公路。由于没有桥梁，渡船是渡过甘巴河的主要的交通工具。
