Hebei Province's "Eradicate the Four Pests" Combat Corps Encircle and Annihilate the Four Pests
    Province-wide Search Campaign to be Launched Before Spring Festival
    (Our report) The "Eradicate the Four Pests" movement in Hebei Province is developing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, from mid-January to late January, a total of more than 40,000 "Eradicate the Four Pests" shock teams were organized throughout the province, eliminating more than 4 million rats, more than 6 million sparrows, clearing more than 14 million cartloads of garbage, and digging out 6,400 catties of fly pupae. After the shock campaign, on the basis of the original 410 "Four-No Villages" (villages free of rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes), 101 more "Four-No Villages," 10 "Three-No Villages," 43 "Two-No Villages," 166 rat-free villages, and 156 sparrow-free villages emerged.
    Many inspiring and advanced examples have emerged in the movement. In Li County, 50,000 Party members, Youth League members, young people, and teenagers, and nearly 100,000 people were mobilized to participate in the movement. Young people were the backbone in organizing 218 combat corps, 1,054 shock groups, 2,340 reconnaissance groups, and 156 firearm teams, mobilizing more than 100,000 sets of 59 types of tools for capturing and killing the four pests, and establishing 20 joint defense headquarters, dividing the war zones and launching a mass offensive against the four pests. Since mid-December of last year, rats and sparrows have been basically eliminated, and overwintering mosquitoes and flies have been eliminated in more than 20,000 vegetable cellars and dark rooms. An'guo County divided the area into 170 war zones. Under the slogan "Rats and sparrows must be wiped out, and mosquitoes and flies must not be allowed to spend the winter," more than 7,000 sets of tools were mobilized, and the sparrows in the county were basically eliminated in half a month. The Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory launched a campaign to "bathe machines and turn over materials," clearing out 3,000 tons of garbage and waste in a few days, improving environmental sanitation, and supporting production.
    Based on the development of the movement, many regions have formulated plans to eliminate the four pests. Fifteen counties, including Linzhang, plan to achieve "Four-No" status in 1958, and cities such as Baoding plan to become "Four-No Cities" within two years. Baoding Prefecture decided to basically eliminate the four pests within the entire prefecture in three years. Li County, An'guo County, and other counties launched a new offensive against the four pests under the slogan "Total mobilization of the army, navy, and air force, not allowing remnant rats and defeated sparrows to spend the New Year, and all men, women, old, and young are mobilized, not letting flies and mosquitoes survive this winter," and a new upsurge will be launched before the Spring Festival.
    The reasons for achieving the above results are mainly as follows: (1) Party committees at all levels have made unified arrangements in conjunction with current production and rectification, and personally led this work. (2) Leaders took the lead in action. For example, leading comrades such as the Provincial Party Secretary, Governor, Municipal Party Secretary, and Mayor took the lead in participating in the shock teams and sweeping the streets. Many other responsible comrades from prefectures, cities, and counties took the lead in participating in the movement, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses. (3) Many vivid, lively, and inspiring forms of propaganda were adopted to carry out effective political mobilization work for the masses. For example, mass oath-taking rallies, commendation of advanced elements, congratulating rat-free and sparrow-free villages, establishing honor rolls, and recounting the suffering caused by the four pests, etc., have enabled the "Eradicate the Four Pests" movement to take root in people's hearts. (4) The backbone and leading role of Party members, Youth League members, and young people was fully utilized. (5) The people's awareness has been raised through socialist education, and the masses have an urgent demand and desire to eliminate the four pests. (6) Technical guidance work has been strengthened.
    However, judging from the current situation, there are still some problems: (1) Some regional leaders have insufficient understanding of the significance of the movement, do not grasp it tightly, and even put this work in opposition to production and rectification. Some counties have not yet formulated plans, and there are lagging corners even in areas where a climax has been formed. (2) Some people have serious right-leaning conservative ideas and have no confidence in whether the four pests can be eliminated or eliminated in a short period of time. (3) In some places where the movement has already started, technical guidance has not kept up.
    In order to further push the movement to a climax, the Provincial Party Committee also convened a meeting of prefectural and municipal party secretaries to make arrangements. It requires that areas where the movement has formed a climax should persist and lead the movement in depth; areas where a climax has not yet been formed should strive to catch up. And it is required that the movement be popularized to every corner of the province before the Spring Festival. At the same time, leaders at all levels are required to personally take action and lead the masses in formulating plans to eliminate the four pests, and to clarify the goals of the struggle. In addition, mass competitions should be organized, inspections and evaluations should be carried out, and a system should be formed to strive to basically make Hebei Province a "Four-No Province" in three to five years.

### 河北省除四害战斗兵团围歼四害  春节前全省将展开搜索战

　　河北省除四害战斗兵团围歼四害
    春节前全省将展开搜索战
    本报讯　河北省除四害运动迅速发展。据不完全统计，从1月中旬到下旬十天内，全省共组织除四害突击队四万多个，消灭老鼠四百多万只，麻雀六百多万只，清除垃圾一千四百多万车，挖蝇蛹六千四百多斤。经过突击运动，在原有四百一十个“四无村”的基础上，又出现了一百零一个“四无村”，十个“三无村”，四十三个“两无村”，一百六十六个无鼠村，一百五十六个无雀村。
    在运动中涌现出很多振奋人心的先进事例。蠡县发动五万党、团员、青、少年和近十万群众投入运动，并以青年为骨干组织了二百一十八个战斗兵团，一千零五十四个突击组，二千三百四十个侦察组，一百五十六个火枪队，动员起五十九种十万多套捕打四害的工具，成立了二十个联防司令部，划分战区向四害展开了群众性的猛攻猛打。从去年12月中旬到现在，基本上消灭了鼠、雀，并且在二万多个菜窖、暗室中消灭了过冬蚊、蝇。安国县划分了一百七十个战区，在“百鼠百雀要搞净，不让蚊蝇过今冬”的口号下，动员起七千多套工具，在半个月时间内就将全县麻雀基本上消灭。唐山市机车车辆修理厂开展机器洗澡、材料翻身运动，在几天内就清出垃圾废料达三千吨，改善了环境卫生，支持了生产。
    根据运动的发展，很多地区制定了除四害规划。临漳等十五个县要在1958年达到“四无”，保定等市要在两年内变为“四无城”，保定专区决定在三年内在全专区范围内基本消灭四害。蠡县、安国等县在“海、陆、空军总动员，不让残鼠败雀度年关，男女老少齐出动，不叫苍蝇蚊子过今冬”的口号下，又向四害展开新的攻势，在春节前就要掀起一个新高潮。
    获得以上成绩的原因，主要有这样几点：（一）各级党委都结合当前生产、整风进行了统一安排，并且亲自领导这一工作。（二）领导带头行动。如省委书记、省长、市委书记、市长等领导同志都带头参加了突击队，打扫街道。其他很多专、市、县的党、政负责同志都带头参加了运动，大大地鼓起了群众的干劲。（三）采用很多生动、活泼、振奋人心的宣传形式，对群众进行了有力的政治鼓动工作。如群众誓师大会、表扬先进，向无鼠无雀村贺喜，建光荣榜，诉四害苦等等，就使除四害运动能深入人心。（四）充分发挥了党、团员和青、少年的骨干带头作用。（五）经过社会主义教育，群众觉悟提高以及群众有着迫切消灭四害的要求和愿望。（六）加强了技术指导工作。
    但是，从目前情况来看，还存在一些问题：（一）有些地区的领导对运动的意义还认识不足，抓的不紧，甚至把这一工作和生产、整风对立起来。有的县还没有制定计划，在形成高潮的地区，还有落后角落。（二）有些人有严重的右倾保守思想，对能否消灭四害或在短期内消灭四害，没有信心。（三）在有些运动已经开展起来的地方，技术指导跟不上去。
    为了把运动进一步推向高潮，省委又召集了地、市委书记会议，进行了布置。要求运动已形成高潮的地区，要坚持下去并把运动引向深入；还没有形成高潮的地区要努力赶上去。并且要求在春节前把运动普及到全省各个角落。同时要求各级领导亲自动手，领导群众制定除四害规划，明确奋斗目标。此外应组织群众开展竞赛，进行检查评比，并形成制度，争取在三、五年内使河北省基本上成为“四无省”。
