Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, 3rd - The Third All-India Conference of the India-China Friendship Association concluded here on the evening of the 2nd, after holding a three-day meeting.

    The plenary session held on the afternoon of the 2nd passed a resolution condemning the plot by certain countries to create "two Chinas," considering it a violation of all norms of international law.

    The meeting pointed out that the establishment of nuclear weapons bases in Taiwan and the stationing of the U.S. Navy in Chinese waters are acts that undermine China's sovereignty and the greatest factors causing international tension in East Asia. It demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from Taiwan and return the island to the People's China.

    The meeting called on the Indian people to launch a mass signature campaign demanding that the United Nations immediately restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the UN General Assembly, Security Council, and all other international bodies. The meeting also stated: "Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no issues concerning Asian-African stability and world peace can be resolved."

    The meeting also pledged wholehearted support for any joint initiative that the Prime Ministers of China and India may propose to halt the arms race, prevent nuclear weapons from entering Asia, and facilitate a summit meeting of heads of state to resolve the escalating international tensions caused by the recent belligerent statements issued by NATO and Baghdad Pact countries.

    The conference adopted a four-point plan to expand cultural contact at all levels between the two countries. This plan can be realized through the exchange of delegations of journalists, scientists, university professors, writers, students, farmers, and workers. The meeting advocated holding discussions and seminars, supplemented by exhibitions and films, to introduce creative activities in all aspects of life in both countries.

    The meeting elected Sundarlal as President of the India-China Friendship Association, Mrs. Uma Nehru as Chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Association, and Bram Prakash, former Chief Minister of the State of Delhi, as Secretary-General of the Association, for a term of two years.

    The India-China Friendship Association announced its acceptance of the invitation from the China-India Friendship Association to send a delegation to visit China this year.

    A mass rally was held in Nabh Park on the evening of the 2nd.
