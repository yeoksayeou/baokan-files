Return from Vietnam
By our reporters Zhan Chao and Xiao Guang

After working intermittently in Vietnam for more than four years, as we were finally about to leave, Comrade Phan Hien, Director of the Press Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, posed us a question at a family-style farewell party: "What impressed you most during your years living in Vietnam?"

How should we answer? Over the past four years, we have personally witnessed the enormous changes this heroic country has undergone: from war to peace; from rural to urban; the temporary division between North and South; the bustling reconstruction; and now, everything is revolving around the transition to socialism. The diligence and simplicity of the Vietnamese people in creating all kinds of great achievements for the independence and prosperity of their motherland have almost constantly moved us deeply. Whenever we recall the past, whether it was the gathering of anti-French guerrilla heroes in the Red River Delta or the fierce battles of Dien Bien Phu; the highly motivated masses in the Viet Bac base area holding peaceful demonstrations or the Hanoi Re-occupation Ceremony on New Year's Day 1955; whether it was the nationwide rent reduction movement or the tide of land reform; the meeting with President Ho Chi Minh or listening to General Vo Nguyen Giap discussing the war situation..., images of kind and familiar faces flood our minds, and the scenes of the time immediately appear clearly before us. Indeed, the impression Vietnam leaves is so colorful, that we really cannot say which point is more profound; and our own feelings are so rich and deep that it is difficult to fully summarize in one or two sentences.

But the host kept urging us, so we had to oblige.

We said: "The days spent in Vietnam have formed a string of pearls in our personal memories, and the thread that runs through those past events is the brotherly friendship of the Vietnamese people. If the host must ask about the most prominent impression of Vietnam, we would like to talk about this first. Because it not only gave us an education in internationalism, but also made us feel at home-like warmth day after day for four years."

Almost from the day we set foot on Vietnamese soil, we felt this deep friendship of the Vietnamese people.

I still remember that one autumn evening, a jeep camouflaged with branches carried several Chinese reporters out of the Shuikou Pass in Guangxi, winding along the rugged and tortuous mountain road towards the heart of Viet Bac. It was drizzling, and the headlights were only half-lit to avoid trouble from French planes, and it was dark all around, so nothing could be seen. When we reached the vicinity of Cao Bang, the car suddenly screeched to a halt. The driver went to inquire and said, "The front was bombed during the day, a big pit, and the road is cut off!" We shone a flashlight around and realized the embarrassing situation: on the left was a high mountain cliff, and on the right was a bottomless sea of trees. The road was narrow, making it difficult to back up; and on both sides were smooth slopes with only one or two short tree stumps. If we couldn't figure out a way to move forward or backward before dawn, there would be no place to hide tomorrow. The Vietnamese comrade accompanying us was getting anxious when a person wearing a conical hat and a raincoat appeared in the rain. It turned out to be the local foreman, who told us: "The laborers have already started filling the pit and repairing the road. Although it is difficult to get earth and stones here, and it usually takes two or three nights to repair, everyone heard that the Chinese comrades were blocked, so they are working extra hard to ensure that the comrades reach the camp before dawn."

Sure enough, when the first hint of dawn appeared in the east, the road was barely passable, and the clothes of the laborers were soaked with rain and sweat. Seeing their tired expressions, we felt endless apologies and gratitude, but the laborers didn't care at all, only concerned with shaking our hands, saying that they were so happy to see Chinese brothers and sisters for the first time. As the car drove far away, we could still faintly hear their enthusiastic voices: "Cheers to China!" "Wish you 'Manh khoe' (good health)!" Later, we learned that many of the laborers had rushed from dozens of kilometers away overnight, and their homes had also been bombed during the day, and some mothers had even had their beloved children taken away by shrapnel.

This was our first contact with Vietnamese laborers, and this deep friendship left a strong impression on us; as the days of our stay in Vietnam grew, it continued to deepen and expand.

Soon after arriving in Vietnam, we discovered that the Vietnamese people were eager to learn about China, and they never let go of any reports, exhibitions, or anything else that introduced China. Residents of French-occupied areas would risk traveling for days and nights to come to the base area to participate in the celebration of the "Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month"; the villagers in the liberated areas insisted on watching Chinese films regardless of wind or rain. We often heard people say, "We face the ocean and have China behind us," "Today's China is tomorrow's Vietnam"; and cadres often used the introduction of Chinese construction as an important part of boosting morale. In the spring of 1952, on the eve of the launch of the Hoa Binh Campaign, the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China came to the front line to convey their experiences of visiting China to the troops. Although it was agreed in advance not to cheer or applaud because the station was very close to the enemy, the soldiers couldn't help but exclaim "Hai qua (wonderful) hai qua..." as they listened, and finally began to clap. If the director of the political department hadn't come out to announce the discipline of only allowing "symbolic applause," the report would have been impossible to continue.

The first time we set out for an interview, President Ho Chi Minh jokingly "warned" us: "Be careful not to be surrounded by your interviewees and interviewed by them!" He was indeed prescient. During the war against the French, we traveled back and forth in various parts of North Vietnam and encountered this situation more than once. The scope of people's questions was extremely wide, from national construction to the lives of the masses, from the health of Chairman Mao Zedong to the drum and bugle calls of the Young Pioneers. Although we had to extend our activities or feel embarrassed by not answering well, we made many friends and were treated like brothers and sisters, even tasting Vietnam's famous specialties during the most difficult days of the war against the French: tiger shrimp and young lady cakes; listening to Vietnamese stories of resistance, customs, and proverbs in the midst of people's busy schedules.

Every time we returned from an interview and cleaned up our belongings, we would always find some "unexpected gains": a rice bowl made of coconut shell, a sun hat woven from sunflower leaves, a scarf made from parachute cloth, a pen holder carved from bamboo... These commemorative gifts were mostly secretly stuffed into our backpacks by the hosts when we weren't paying attention. The Vietnamese, like many other Eastern peoples, are not good at expressing intense emotions directly, but is there anything more precious and thought-provoking than their thick and subtle emotions? They speak softly, smile gently, and entrust sincere friendship with simple words. According to their own customs, they call the Chinese comrades who come to Vietnam as "brothers" and "sisters," and they arrange everything properly without you realizing it. For the sake of friendship, they are always ready to lend a helping hand, and can even risk their lives. I remember in October 1955, when the Chinese Art Troupe was boating on West Lake in Hanoi, they were suddenly attacked by a storm. Many members of the troupe capsized and fell into the water, and the situation was extremely critical. At this time, the tourists on the lake shore jumped into the lake to rescue them. A sixteen-year-old peanut-selling girl swam up and dived down alone, rescuing three Chinese comrades in a row, until finally she was exhausted by the wind and waves and was forcibly pushed ashore by others. When asked why she was so brave, she replied without hesitation, "I love them!"

The little girl's words revealed the "secret" in the hearts of the Vietnamese people, even if they don't say it, you can still feel it. For example, during festivals, everywhere you see people tying the Soviet flag, the five-star red flag, and the golden star red flag tightly together; in the large bamboo sheds where the masses gather, the portraits of President Ho Chi Minh, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Bulganin smile at everyone side by side; whenever it rains during outdoor gatherings, people rush to take out their nylon cloth to cover the portraits of the leaders. For example, during the war against the French, on the way to advance, the young soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army always remembered to seize the interval to read Wei Wei's Korean correspondence "Who are the Most Lovable People." They read it over and over again, their faces turning red with excitement, tears glistening on their eyelashes, and gradually, the cold, fatigue... all were forgotten. The soldiers simply talked about the Chinese People's Volunteers, so warmly, as if they had fought together.

Similar scenes can be seen almost every day in life. Particularly memorable is a cemetery not far from Hanoi, where Chinese comrades who sacrificed in Vietnam are buried. Among them are artists who came to Vietnam to perform, and workers who helped build railways.... There is no special person to take care of it here, and no one needs to take extra care, but it is kept tidy and clean all year round; the graves are constantly covered with green grass and fresh flowers, and with the changing seasons, residents from far and near automatically send white chrysanthemums, deep red roses, phoenix flowers like fireballs, and sometimes a small bunch of violets. Even the naughtiest children come here and walk carefully, afraid of stepping on a blade of grass in the cemetery; if they meet a stranger, they will whisper to you: "Chinese aunts and uncles are resting here."

There is no need to give more examples, although there are more; are the above not enough to show the fraternal feelings of the Vietnamese people? (To be continued) (with picture)

　　越南归来
　　本报记者　展潮　萧光
    在越南断断续续工作了四年多，当最后要离开的时候，越南外交部新闻司司长潘贤同志在家庭式的送别会上，给我们出了一道题：“在越南生活这几年，印象最深的是什么？”
    怎么说好呢？四年多来，我们亲眼看到这个英雄的国度经历了多么巨大的变化：由战争转入和平；由农村进入城市；暂时的南北分治；热火朝天的恢复建设；而今，一切又正围绕着向社会主义过渡在进行了。勤劳、质朴的越南人民为了祖国的独立、富强所创造的种种丰功伟绩，几乎无时无刻不使我们深深地受到感动。每当我们回忆起过去的一段，不论是红河三角洲敌后游击英雄的聚会或是奠边府激烈的战斗；斗志高涨的越北根据地群众和平大示威或是1955年元旦的河内还都典礼；不论是席卷全国的减租运动或是土地改革的浪潮；胡志明主席的接见或是听武元甲总司令谈战局……，我们的脑中就涌出一张张亲切熟悉的面影，而当时当地的情景也立即清晰地呈现眼前。的确，越南给人的印象是如此绚烂多采，我们一时真说不上哪一点更深刻；而自己的感受又是这样的丰富和深切，很难用一两句话来完全概括。
    但是主人却一再催促，我们只好勉为其难。
    我们说：“在越南度过的日子，已经形成个人记忆里的一串珍珠，贯穿那件件往事的纽带正是越南人民兄弟般的友情。如果主人一定要问对越南最突出的印象，我们愿意首先谈谈这一点。因为它不仅使我们受到国际主义的教育，而且四年如一日地感觉在家里似的温暖。”
    几乎从踏上越南的国土那天开始，我们就感到了越南人民这种深厚友情。
    还记得那是一个秋天的晚上，树枝伪装的吉普车载着我们几个中国记者出了广西的水口关，沿着崎岖、曲折的山路向越北的心脏地区蜿蜒前进。天，淅淅沥沥地下着细雨，为了怕法国飞机找麻烦，车灯也只打开了半明不亮的一盏，周围黑洞洞的，什么也看不见。走到高平附近，车身嘎—吱一声，突然煞住了。远远传来了嘈杂的人声，还可以看见星星点点的火光。“糟了”，司机去打听回来说：“前边白天挨了炸弹，好大的一个坑，路给切断了！”我们用电筒四下一照，才明白处境的尴尬：这地方左边是望不见顶的高山崖壁，右边是深不见底的树海。路窄，不好倒车；两边光溜溜的，只有一两根矮树椿子。要是在天亮以前想不出法子进退，明天连隐蔽的地方也没有。伴送我们的越南同志正在发急，一位头戴笠帽、身披蓑衣的人在雨中出现了，原来是当地的民工队长，他告诉我们：“民工已经动手填坑补路了。尽管这里取土砸石困难，往常总要两三宵才能修成，但大伙儿听说中国同志给挡住了，特别加油干，保证同志们在黎明以前赶到宿营地。”
    果然，当东方刚露出第一片鱼肚白的时候，公路已勉强可行，而民工同志的衣衫也全为雨水和汗水浸透了。看到他们疲劳的神色，我们是说不尽的抱歉和感激，民工同志却满不在乎地只顾同我们握手，光说自己能够头一回亲眼看到中国的兄弟姐妹，不知有多高兴。汽车驶出老远，还隐隐约约听得他们热情的声浪：“欢呼，中国！”“祝同志‘孟快’（健康）！”后来我们才听说许多民工同志是连夜从几十公里以外赶来的，他们住的地方白天也挨了炸，有的母亲甚至被弹片夺去了心爱的孩子。
    这是我们第一次同越南劳动者接触，这种深情厚谊给我们留下了强烈的印象；随着在越南逗留的日子，它又不断地得到加深和扩大。
    到越南后不久，我们就发现：越南人民渴望了解中国，对于介绍中国的报告会、展览或其他，从来不肯轻易放过。法占区的居民，可以冒险跋涉几天几夜的路程，赶来根据地参加“越苏中友好月”的庆祝集会；解放区的老乡风雨无阻地坚持观看中国影片。常听得人们说：“我们面对海洋、背靠中国”，“今天的中国是明天的越南”；而干部也常把介绍中国建设作为鼓舞士气的一项重要内容。1952年春天，和平战役发动前夕，越南人民访华代表团来到了前线，向部队传达访问中国的见闻。虽然因为驻地距离敌人很近，事先约好不欢呼、不鼓掌；战士们听着听着仍然情不自禁地发出“海呱（妙极了）海呱……”的赞声，终于拍起手来了。如果后来不是政治部主任出来宣布只许作“象征性鼓掌”的纪律，报告简直无法进行下去。
    第一次出发去采访，胡志明主席就开玩笑似的“警告”我们：“小心被你们的采访对象包围起来访问你们！”他老人家果真有先见之明，抗战期间，我们在北越各地巡回往返，不止一次地遇到这种局面。人们发问的范围极广，从国家建设问到群众的生活，从毛泽东主席的健康一直问到少年先锋队的鼓、号点子。我们虽然不得不因此延长一些活动时间、或答不好而发窘；但却交上了许多朋友，受到亲如兄弟姐妹一样的接待，即使在抗战最艰难的日子里还尝到越南著名的特产：老虎虾和姑娘饼；在人们百忙的空隙中听讲越南的抗敌故事、风习和民谚。
    每次访问归来清理东西，总会发现点什么“意外的收获”：一只椰子壳做的饭碗，一顶葵叶编织的遮阳帽，降落伞裁的围巾，竹子雕刻成的笔筒……这些富有纪念意义的礼物，大都是主人趁我们不留意的时候，给悄悄地塞在背包里的。越南人也像许多东方民族所特有的那样，不善于正面表达炽烈的感情，但是，还有比他们那种浑厚和含蓄的感情更可珍贵和耐人寻味的吗？他们轻轻地说话、浅浅地微笑，用朴素的话语托付转达真挚的友谊。他们按照自家的习惯，把来越南作客的中国同志唤为“哥哥”、“姐姐”，在你不知不觉当中，妥贴地安排好了一切。为了友谊，他们随时准备伸出援助的手，甚至可以奋不顾身。记得1955年10月，我国艺术团在河内西湖泛舟游览，遭到暴风雨的突然袭击，许多团员翻船落水，情况至为危急。这时，正在湖边的游人纷纷跳下湖去抢救。有一位十六岁的卖花生的小姑娘，独自游上来又潜下去，一连救起了三位中国同志，直到最后她自己被风浪打得筋疲力尽才由别人强推上岸。人家问她怎么这样勇敢，她毫不思索地回答说：“我爱他们！”
    小姑娘的话，道破了越南人民心里的“秘密”，尽管他们嘴上不说，你还是能感觉出来。譬如，节日的时候，到处看见人们把苏联国旗、五星红旗和金星红旗牢牢地结在一起；在群众聚会的大竹棚里，胡主席、毛主席和布尔加宁主席的画像，肩并肩地对着大伙儿微笑；每逢在露天举行的集会遇到下雨，人们争先拿出自己的尼龙布来给领袖像披上。又譬如，战时，在进军的途中，年轻的越南人民军战士总忘不了抓住间歇来朗读魏巍的朝鲜通讯“谁是最可爱的人”。他们读了一遍又一遍，脸孔因为激动而变得通红，睫毛上闪着泪花，渐渐地，寒冷、疲乏……全忘了。战士们索性谈论起中国人民志愿军来，那样地热络，就像在一块儿打过仗。
    类似的镜头，生活里几乎每天都可以见到。特别令人难忘的是离河内不远的一块墓地，那里埋葬着在越南牺牲的中国同志。其中有来越南访问演出的艺术家，也有帮助建设铁路的工人……。这儿并没有专人看管，也不用谁格外关照，却常年保持着整齐、干净；坟头上绿草鲜花不断，随着季节的变换，远近的居民自动送来了白色的菊花、深红的玫瑰、火球一样的凤凰花，有时还夹上一小扎紫萝兰。即使最淘气的孩子来到这里，也小心翼翼地走动，他们生怕踩坏了墓地上一棵草；碰上面生的客人，他还会细声细气地指点你：“这里安息着中国姑姑、伯伯。”
    不用举更多的例子了，虽然它们有的是；难道以上这些还不足以表明越南人民的兄弟之情吗？　（未完）（附图片）
