Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 23rd. Tianjin's 1958 production plan targets have been leaping forward repeatedly. The originally formulated plan, which called for a 13% increase in output value compared to last year, has now been raised to over 40%. This target will bring Tianjin's total industrial output value to 5 billion yuan this year.

The birth of this target is the result of workers, who have raised their awareness in the rectification movement, breaking through conservative thinking. Initially, many factory leaders lacked confidence in completing the plan targets assigned by higher authorities; some even hesitated to present the targets to the workers for discussion, fearing that "failure to meet the targets would damage the enthusiasm of the masses." However, once the workers were mobilized, the situation changed dramatically, surpassing the targets assigned by higher authorities by 30%, 50%, 100%, and 200%. The leading cadres of the joint state-private venture Water Pump Manufacturing Factory No. 1 were initially frightened by the target of increasing the total output value by 61% compared to last year. After receiving the task, they perfunctorily asked the workers to "pass" it and then considered it the factory's plan without any changes. However, after the workers participated in the production leap forward mobilization meeting convened by higher authorities, they automatically studied the problems in production and revealed that over 30,000 work hours were wasted last year due to waiting for materials, blueprints, and tools. The workers also revealed that although eight hours were scheduled for work each day, only six hours were actually worked. If these wasted work hours were utilized, over 700,000 yuan in value could be created this year. Furthermore, with the addition of new equipment through this year's planned investment from higher authorities, they were fully confident in increasing this year's total output value by 140% compared to last year.

A surge of mutual competition has unfolded among factories, work groups, and individuals. Advanced targets have become the most important goal for the workers. On January 31st, the workers of the Third Group of the Fine Spinning Section B of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4 proposed launching a competition to all work groups in the city. On the same day, a surge of catching up with the advanced was set off in the cotton textile factories, with hundreds of work groups putting forward their challenge conditions. The Fourth Group of Fine Spinning Section A of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 and the "Seagull Work Team" of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 were both model work groups in Tianjin in the past. They studied the production conditions and put forward even more advanced targets. Of the seventy-plus challenging work groups at State-owned Cotton Mill No. 5, sixty have partially or fully achieved their challenge conditions. The initial steelmaking time set by the steelworkers of Tianjin Steel Plant was five hours, eleven minutes, and thirty-six seconds. Soon, the Wang Zhenlian group improved the operation of tapping the steel and checking the steel samples, shortening the steelmaking time to five hours. However, the Du Baosen group proposed a steelmaking time that was five minutes shorter than the Wang Zhenlian group. At this time, the Wang Zhenlian group studied methods to strengthen thermal control, shortening the steelmaking time to four hours and fifty minutes. However, the advanced target of this group was broken again by the Wang Qifa group with a record of producing one furnace of steel in four hours and twenty-eight minutes. Thus, a competition to catch up with the advanced and surpass the advanced unfolded. Each group successively broke through the original targets, shortening the steelmaking time from over five hours in January to four hours and twenty-eight minutes.

The workers have put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals and technical measures to achieve advanced plans. The vast majority of these suggestions and measures do not cost money or cost very little and can be resolved within the work groups and workshops. Therefore, as the plan targets are raised, production figures also increase, and new records are constantly emerging. According to statistics from 294 factories, among 4,165 work groups, 928 groups broke through their work group plan targets in the recent half-month.

### 增长速度从13％跳到40％  天津职工突破保守障碍订出先进指标

    增长速度从13％跳到40％
    天津职工突破保守障碍订出先进指标
    据新华社天津23日电　天津市1958年的生产计划指标一再跃进，原来制订的、比去年增长13％的产值计划，已经提高到40％以上。这个指标将使今年天津工业计划总产值达到五十亿元。
    这个指标的诞生，是整风运动中提高了觉悟的工人群众突破保守思想的结果。起初，许多工厂的领导干部对于完成上级下达的计划指标是没有信心的；有的人甚至不敢把上级下达的计划指标交给工人群众讨论，怕“达不到指标，损伤群众的积极性”。但是，当工人群众发动起来以后，情况大变，不仅达到了上级下达的指标，而且是30％、50％、100％、200％地超过。公私合营水泵制造一厂的领导干部起初就被今年计划总产值比去年提高61％的指标吓住了，领回任务以后马马虎虎叫工人“通过”一下就原封不动地算做工厂的计划。但是，工人们参加了上级召开的生产跃进誓师大会以后，就自动地研究生产中的问题，揭发出去年一年内因为等材料、等图纸、等工具就浪费了三万多个工时。工人们还揭发出一天规定干八个小时，实际上干不了六个小时。如果把这些浪费工时利用起来，今年就可以创造价值七十多万元，再加上今年上级计划投资增添部分设备，完全有信心使今年的总产值比去年增加140％。
    在工厂之间、班组之间、个人之间展开了互相比赛的热潮。先进的指标已经成为工人们最注意的目标。国棉四厂细纱乙班三组的工人们，在1月31日向全市各小组提出了开展竞赛的倡议。当天，在各棉纺织厂就掀起一个赶先进的热潮，有上百个小组提出了应战条件。国棉二厂二细纱甲班四组和国棉六厂的“海鸥工作队”，都是过去的天津市模范小组，他们研究了生产条件，提出了更为先进的指标。国棉五厂七十多个应战的小组，已经有六十个小组部分或全部实现了他们的应战条件。天津钢厂炼钢工人们最初制定的炼钢时间是五小时十一分三十六秒。不久，王振连小组改进了扒出钢口和看钢样的操作，使炼钢时间缩短到五小时。但是，杜宝森小组提出的炼钢时间比王振连小组又缩短五分钟。这时，王振连小组又研究了加强热工控制的方法，使炼钢时间缩短到四小时五十分钟。可是，这个小组的先进指标又被王起发小组用四小时二十八分炼一炉钢的成绩打破了。于是，赶上先进、超过先进的竞赛就展开了。各小组相继突破原有的指标，使炼钢时间由1月份的五小时以上缩短到四小时二十八分钟。
    工人们为实现先进计划提出了上万件的合理化建议和技术措施。这些建议和措施绝大部分都是不花钱或少花钱，在小组和车间就能解决的。因此，随着计划指标的提高，生产数字也跟着提高，新纪录不断出现。据二百九十四个工厂的统计，在四千一百六十五个小组中，在最近半个月内突破了小组计划指标的就有九百二十八个小组。
