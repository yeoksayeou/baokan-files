I fully support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

In October 1957, the Party Central Committee announced the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. The people of Jiangsu were all greatly encouraged. Currently, over 17 million people in the province are engaged in a major winter-spring production campaign, primarily focused on water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and strengthening field management of summer crops. They are preparing for five years of hard work to basically achieve the various targets of the agricultural development program.

Schistosomiasis Harms Labor and Impacts Production
2.2 Million Patients in the Province, Over 10 Million Farmers Severely Threatened

To achieve the agricultural development program ahead of schedule, we must take all effective measures. A very important measure is to more forcefully protect the agricultural workforce. The strength of the workforce is closely related to the health of the farmers. I would like to express some opinions on this issue. Jiangsu Province has over 37 million farmers. Since liberation, the health of farmers has greatly improved. Diseases such as smallpox, cholera, relapsing fever, and kala-azar, which previously had large numbers of patients, can now be said to be basically extinct. However, many diseases continue to ravage the rural workforce, such as schistosomiasis, filariasis, and malaria, with millions of patients each year. Among these, schistosomiasis is the most harmful. According to current incomplete statistics, there are approximately 2.2 million people in Jiangsu Province suffering from schistosomiasis, most of whom are full or semi-able-bodied laborers. Over 10 million farmers are under threat. People infected with this disease generally experience a reduction in labor capacity of 20% or more, while those in the middle and late stages completely lose their labor capacity. In areas where the disease is severely prevalent, many farmers have lost their families and died. For example, in Dujia Village in Kunshan County, which originally had over 80 households and more than 300 people in 1940, only 34 households and 39 people remain due to the prevalence of schistosomiasis, and most of them are sick. In 1955, the eighth production team of the Ailing Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangdu County suffered an acute infection, and most of the main laborers fell ill, resulting in no one to harvest the mid-season rice, causing significant production losses.

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by schistosoma parasites in the human body. They lay eggs in the body, and the eggs are excreted with the patient's feces. In the water, they hatch into miracidia, which burrow into Oncomelania hupensis snails and transform into countless cercariae. These cercariae are released in large numbers from the snails, float in the water, and take the opportunity to penetrate the body through the skin when people or cattle enter the water, developing into schistosomes. People and animals infected with schistosomiasis gradually weaken and eventually die. The infection rate in cattle in our province is even higher than in humans. Schistosomiasis-infected cattle generally have about half the plowing capacity.

Initial Results Achieved in Prevention and Control Work Over the Past Two Years
Over 220,000 Patients Treated, Snails Eliminated from Over 50 Million Square Meters

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we began schistosomiasis prevention and control work in 1956. After two years of exploration and struggle, we have basically clarified the situation. Currently, 51 cities and counties on both sides of the Yangtze River in our province have varying degrees of schistosomiasis prevalence. The area inhabited by Oncomelania snails reaches over 550 million square meters, of which about 400 million square meters are reed marshes and lake beaches on both sides of the Yangtze River, and over 90 million square meters are around villages and irrigation canals. Regionally, the Suzhou, Songjiang, and Yangzhou special districts are the most severely affected, with human infection rates generally ranging from 5% to 30%. The prevalence of this infectious disease has a significant impact on agricultural production.

The principle of eliminating schistosomiasis is to take comprehensive measures. The methods to eliminate schistosomiasis are: to educate cadres and the masses so they understand the serious impact of schistosomiasis on production development; to combine scientific technology with mass movements; and to combine prevention and control work with production. Targeting the life cycle of schistosomiasis, focusing on its main links, and simultaneously carrying out extermination, the specific methods are: if schistosoma parasites are in the human body, use antimony agents to treat patients and kill the schistosomes; if the eggs are in the feces, kill the eggs by managing the feces; if the schistosoma becomes a miracidium and burrows into the snail, eliminate the snail; if it becomes a cercaria in the water, do personal protection, so it cannot find people and animals to parasitize and die. Combining these methods can eliminate schistosomiasis. We have done this for the past two years, and experience has proven that this method is effective.

In the past two years, our province's schistosomiasis elimination work has treated over 220,000 patients, eliminated snails from over 50 million square meters, and controlled most of the feces in epidemic areas. The masses have been widely educated. The province has trained over 5,500 professional cadres and over 118,000 mass backbone personnel. Three townships have completely eliminated schistosomiasis: Chengbei Township in Qingpu County, Liu'an Township in Gaoyou County, and Xiaohu Township in Jiangdu County. These townships were once areas where schistosomiasis was very prevalent. After mobilizing the masses and fighting for two years, schistosomiasis was eliminated. Treatable patients were cured, snails were eliminated, and feces were properly managed, creating a completely new atmosphere. In the summer of 1957, there were no new infections. In addition, 22 townships and 137 cooperatives have also eliminated snails. These townships and cooperatives have also controlled the development of the disease.

Conservative Thinking Cannot Stand
Combining Water Conservancy, Fertilizer Accumulation, and Prevention and Control is Beneficial to Patients and Production

Over the past two years, although our province's schistosomiasis prevention and control work has achieved certain results, progress has been slow. The fundamental reason is that there is serious right-leaning conservative thinking among leaders at all levels, underestimating the strength of the masses. This major issue, involving the vital interests of millions of people, has not been seriously addressed by relying on and mobilizing the masses. They saw more of the difficulties and underestimated the favorable conditions. Therefore, the plans were repeatedly revised, the pace slowed down, and the time was delayed. To this day, some cadres still do not believe that schistosomiasis can be eliminated. They believe that schistosomiasis is widely distributed, is innate, and cannot be completely eradicated; they believe that there are too many patients, they cannot be cured, and feces are difficult to manage. Some people also believe that although schistosomiasis can be eliminated, it will take a long time: 100 years, 200 years, so their actions are also slow. These backward and conservative ideas have objectively become protectors of schistosomiasis. As mentioned earlier, Chengbei Township, Liu'an Township, Xiaohu Township, and other places where schistosomiasis was severely prevalent, eliminated schistosomiasis in just two years. This fact is the most powerful rebuttal to those who believe in the impossibility of elimination. Some people also believe that eliminating schistosomiasis, especially eliminating snails and treating diseases, is contradictory to production, believing that it is a waste of manpower and resources and hinders production. Obviously, this is a subjective and conservative idea. The experience of eliminating schistosomiasis in the past two years has proven that eliminating schistosomiasis must be combined with production, and work should be carried out through various production measures. The better the combination of the two, the faster and more effective the elimination of schistosomiasis will be. In the townships where schistosomiasis has been eliminated, the townships where snails have been eliminated, and the townships where feces have been properly managed, their common experience is: snail elimination work is always combined with water conservancy construction, and where water conservancy is built, snails are eliminated; where fertilizer accumulation is done, feces are managed. Some areas have greatly increased fertilizer because the elimination of schistosomiasis is well combined with fertilizer accumulation. For example, in Shanghai County's Youyi Cooperative, the amount of manure produced per month before fecal management was 126 dan, and after fecal management, it increased to 226 dan. Treating patients can also be combined with the labor arrangement of agricultural cooperatives. Puzhuang Township in Zhenze County followed the method of treating less during busy seasons, treating more during less busy seasons, treating both ends (the old and the young) during very busy seasons, and treating the middle (full and semi-able-bodied laborers) during moderately busy seasons, which both treated patients and completed production tasks. Moreover, after the patients were cured, the labor force increased by one to two times. After the eighth production team of Ailing Cooperative in Jiangdu County was treated in 1956, all the patients recovered their health, and the grain output that year greatly exceeded the surrounding townships and cooperatives. Those who believe that there is a contradiction between schistosomiasis prevention and control and production obviously cannot stand in the face of these vivid and powerful facts.

Prevention and Control Work Will Advance by Leaps and Bounds
Eliminate Schistosomiasis and the Four Pests Together, We Will Definitely Improve People's Health

Through the national rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the leadership has overcome right-leaning conservative ideas, the enthusiasm of the masses has been mobilized, the socialist construction cause is advancing by leaps and bounds, and a new situation of comprehensive upsurge has emerged in various tasks. Schistosomiasis prevention and control work is also moving forward at an unprecedented pace. It is estimated that through a large-scale patriotic health campaign this spring, combined with water conservancy construction, 27 cities and counties can basically eliminate snails. By the end of 1958, all snails in general areas except for the Yangtze River grassland and sparsely populated lake areas can be eliminated. Most of the treatable patients can also be cured before 1960.

We have clearly realized that as long as we believe in the masses and earnestly mobilize the masses, we can create miracles that were difficult for our predecessors to imagine. With the masses mobilized, grain production can be doubled, and even flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows that fly in the sky, burrow underground, reproduce quickly, and are widely distributed can be basically eliminated within four years. As for schistosomiasis, which has been tormenting the people for thousands of years, we also have full confidence and determination to completely eliminate it before 1960! A few years later, with the elimination of the four pests and schistosomiasis, the health level of the people will definitely be greatly improved. At that time, our farmers will be strong, energetic, and in high spirits. With such a strong labor force on the agricultural front, we will have greater confidence in completing and exceeding the tasks stipulated in the agricultural development program ahead of schedule.

### 两年内要消灭血吸虫病  管文蔚代表报告江苏省防治血吸虫病情况

　　两年内要消灭血吸虫病
    管文蔚代表报告江苏省防治血吸虫病情况
    我完全拥护李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告、吴玉章主任关于汉语拼音方案的报告。
    一九五七年十月，党中央公布了全国农业发展纲要的修正草案。江苏人民无不欢欣鼓舞。现在，全省有一千七百多万人，投入了以兴修水利、积肥、绿化和加强夏熟作物田间管理为主要内容的冬春大生产运动，准备苦战五年，争取基本上实现农业发展纲要的各项指标。
    血吸虫病危害劳动力影响生产
    全省患者有二百二十万人  千余万农民受到严重威胁
    我们要提前实现农业发展纲要，必须采取各项有效措施。其中一个非常重要的措施就是更有力地保护农民劳动力，劳动力的强弱，与农民的健康状况是密切关连着的。我想就这个问题发表一点意见。江苏省共有农民三千七百多万。解放以来，农民的健康状况已经有了很大的改善，如天花、霍乱、回归热、黑热病等过去患病者的数字很大，现在可以说基本上绝迹了。但是，还有很多疾病仍在摧残农村的劳动力，如血吸虫病、丝虫病、疟疾等，每年都有数百万的患者，其中尤以血吸虫病危害最为严重。据目前不完整的统计，江苏全省患血吸虫病的约有二百二十余万人，其中大都是全劳动力和半劳动力。受威胁的农民有一千多万。染了这种病的人，一般都要减少劳动力百分之二十以上，中、晚期病人就要完全丧失劳动力。这个病流行严重的地区，不少农民家破人亡。如昆山县杜家村在一九四零年原有八十多户、三百多人，由于血吸虫病的流行，现在只剩三十四户、三十九个人，而且大都有病。江都县艾菱农业社第八生产队一九五五年患了急性感染，主要劳动力大都病倒了，以致中熟稻无人收割，生产受到很大损失。
    血吸虫病是由于血吸虫寄生在人体内引起的一种疾病。它在人体内产卵，虫卵随着病人的粪便排泄，在水内孵化成毛蚴，毛蚴钻入钉螺蛳，又蜕变成为无数的尾蚴，自钉螺蛳中大量排出，在水中浮游，人或牛等下水时即乘机从皮肤钻入体内，发育成为血吸虫。感染了血虫病的人畜，身体就逐渐地衰弱下去，乃至死亡。我省耕牛的感染率较人尤高，有血吸虫的耕牛，耕作能力一般要减少一半左右。
    两年来防治工作初获效果
    二十二万多病人得到治疗  灭螺达五千多万平方公尺
    在党中央和毛主席的领导下，我们于一九五六年就开始进行血吸虫病的防治工作。经过两年的摸索战斗，已经基本上摸清了情况。现在我省长江两岸五十一个市县都有不同程度的血吸虫病的流行。钉螺面积达五亿五千多万平方公尺，其中长江两岸芦荡和湖滩约有四亿多平方公尺，村庄周围及灌溉河道约有九千多万平方公尺。从地区来讲，苏州、松江、扬州三个专区最为严重，人的感染率一般都在百分之五到百分之三十。这种传染病的流行，给予农业生产的影响很大。
    消灭血吸虫病的方针是采取综合性的措施。消灭血吸虫病的办法是：搞通干部和群众思想，使他们了解血吸虫病对发展生产的严重影响；采取科学技术与群众运动相结合；防治工作与生产相结合的办法。针对着血吸虫的生活史，抓住其主要的环节，同时进行歼灭，其具体办法是：血吸虫如果寄生在人体内，就使用锑剂治疗病人，杀灭血吸虫；如果虫卵在粪便当中，就通过管理粪便，杀灭虫卵；如果血吸虫变为毛蚴钻入钉螺里面，就用消灭钉螺的办法消灭它；如果它变为尾蚴在水里时，就做好个人防护，使它找不到人畜寄生而死亡。这几个办法综合进行，血吸虫就可以消灭了。两年来我们是这样做的，经验证明这办法是有效的。
    我省消灭血吸虫病工作，两年来总共治疗了二十二万多病人，灭螺五千多万平方公尺，流行地区的粪便大部分都管起来了，群众普遍地受到了教育。全省训练了业务干部五千五百多人，群众骨干十一万八千多人。彻底消灭了血吸虫病的乡出现了三个，即青浦县的城北乡，高邮县的六安乡，江都县的小湖乡。这些乡过去都是血吸虫病流行很严重的地区，经过发动群众，进行了两年的搏斗，血吸虫病就消灭了。可以治疗的病人医好了，钉螺灭光了，粪便也管好了，气象焕然一新。一九五七年夏季再没有一个新感染的人了。此外，还有二十二个乡、一百三十七个社也已灭光了钉螺。这些乡社也已控制了疾病的发展。
    保守思想站不住脚
    兴水利积肥料结合防治  有利于病人有利于生产
    两年来，我省的血吸虫病防治工作虽已获得了一定的成绩，但进度是迟缓的。其根本原因是由于我们各级领导上存在着严重的右倾保守思想，对群众力量估计不足，这样一个涉及千百万群众切身利益的大事，没有认真地依靠群众、发动群众来干，对困难一面看得较多，对有利条件估计不足，因而规划一再修改，步伐放慢了，时间推迟了。到今天为止，还有一部分干部不相信血吸虫病是可以消灭的，他们认为血吸虫散布很广，是天生的，搞不完的；他们认为病人很多，治不完，粪便不好管理等。还有一些人认为血吸虫病虽然可以消灭，但时间要长：要一百年、二百年，因而行动也是慢吞吞的。这些落后保守的思想，客观上成了血吸虫的保护者。前面说过的血吸虫病流行严重的城北乡、六安乡、小湖乡等地，仅仅两年就消灭了血吸虫病。这一事实对于那些不能消灭论者是一个最有力的批驳。还有一些人认为消灭血吸虫特别是灭螺、治病，和生产是有矛盾的，认为这是劳民伤财，妨碍生产。显然这是一种主观保守的想法。两年来消灭血吸虫病的经验已经证明，消灭血吸虫必须和生产相结合，通过生产的各种措施来进行工作。两者结合得愈好，血吸虫病的消灭就愈快，效果也愈好。在血吸虫病已经消灭的乡，钉螺已经灭光的乡，粪便已经管好的乡，他们的共同经验是：灭螺工作总是结合兴修水利进行的，水利修到那里，钉螺就灭到那里；积肥搞到那里，粪便就管到那里。有的地区因为消灭血吸虫病与积肥结合的好，所以肥料也大大增加了。如上海县友谊社粪便管理前每月出粪一百二十六担，粪便管理后便增加到二百二十六担。治疗病人也可以和农业社的劳力安排相结合。震泽县浦庄乡按照大忙少治、小忙多治、大忙治两头（老的和小的）、中忙治中间（全劳动力和半劳动力）的办法，既治疗了病人，又完成了生产任务。而且病人治疗好了，劳动力增加了一倍至两倍。江都县艾菱社第八生产队，经一九五六年的治疗后，病人全部恢复健康，当年的粮食产量就大大地超过了周围的乡社。那些认为防治血吸虫病和生产有矛盾的说法，在这些生动有力的事实面前，显然是站不住脚的。
    防治工作将要大步迈进
    把血吸虫和四害一齐除净  一定能提高人民健康水平
    经过全民整风和反右派斗争，领导上克服了右倾保守思想，群众的积极性已经调动起来，社会主义建设事业正以排山倒海之势飞跃前进，各项工作出现了全面高涨的新形势，血吸虫病的防治工作也以前所未有的步伐向前迈进。预计今年春季通过大规模的爱国卫生运动，结合兴修水利，将有二十七个市县可以把钉螺基本上灭光，一九五八年底可以把除了长江草滩和人迹少到的湖荡地区以外的一般地区的钉螺全部消灭。可以治疗的病人在一九六零年前也可大部治愈。
    我们已经清楚地认识到：只要相信群众，认真地发动群众，就能创造出前人所难以设想的奇迹。群众发动起来，粮食可以成倍的增产，就连那天上飞、地下钻、繁殖快、分布广的苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀，我们也可以在四年内把它们基本上消灭。至于数千年来一直折磨着人民的血吸虫病，我们也有充分的信心和决心在一九六零年前把它全部消灭干净！几年以后，随着四害的消除，血吸虫病的消灭，人民的健康水平一定会大大提高，那时候我们的农民将是个个身强力壮、精神焕发、情绪饱满、心情愉快。在农业战线上有这样一支强大的劳动队伍，我们将有更大的信心，提前和超额完成农业发展纲要中所规定给我们的任务了。
