Hebei Provincial Leading Departments Issue Call to Advance
Strive for a Summer Bumper Harvest Through Three Months of Hard Work
Require First Secretaries of Party Committees at All Levels to Take the Lead in Firing the First Shot

(This Newspaper Despatch) According to the Hebei Daily, autumn wheat in most parts of Hebei is about to turn green, and some early-maturing crops are being sown. The leading departments of Hebei Province believe that it is necessary to seize the opportunity to immediately create a magnificent and powerful upsurge in striving for a summer harvest. On the 24th, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly issued instructions, requiring the entire population to be mobilized urgently, to arrange all farm work, to organize all labor forces, to overcome difficulties in every possible way, to fight hard for three months, to fire the first shot, and strive to achieve a summer grain harvest of 8 billion jin, aiming for a target of 10 billion jin.

The final revision of Hebei Province's agricultural production plan for 1958 is to reach a total grain output of 25 billion jin, and strive to exceed it. If this plan is realized, Hebei Province can fundamentally change its grain shortage and achieve self-sufficiency in grain. In order to realize this glorious and arduous production increase plan, it is first required that the acreage of this year's summer crops be expanded to more than 45 million mu, with a total output of 8 billion jin, aiming for a target of 10 billion jin. If this plan is realized, it will play an extremely important role in further inspiring the revolutionary drive of the broad masses of cadres and people, and will also lay a solid material foundation for the realization of the annual production plan.

The instruction said that to fire the first shot in the great leap forward in annual production, it is necessary to widely cultivate large areas of high-yield fields. Through the advanced demonstration role of high-yield fields, further drive the general increase in production of ordinary fields. The area of high-yield wheat fields should be further expanded, together with other early-maturing crop high-yield fields, to 20 million mu, with an average yield of 320 jin per mu. If this plan is realized, coupled with the general increase in production of 25 million mu, not only can the output of 8 billion jin be ensured, but the target of 10 billion jin may also be achieved.

The instruction said that in the struggle to strive for a bumper summer crop harvest, the following key measures must be firmly grasped to comprehensively strengthen field management, and be implemented in accordance with production needs until the realization of the harvest.

First, seize the opportunity before the autumn wheat turns green to carry out rolling and harrowing of wheat, and do a good job in preserving soil moisture and replanting seedlings in wheat fields.

Second, due to the lack of rain last autumn and little snow in winter, the soil moisture of this year's spring wheat is even worse, so timely irrigation has become a major measure to strive for a bumper harvest. All localities should give priority to using existing and continuously developing water conservancy facilities for irrigating summer crops, and must make early preparations for the installation of water lifting tools and the management of irrigation ditches to ensure timely watering.

Third, it is required that sufficient base fertilizer be applied to early-maturing spring-sown crops to promote root development and robust growth; and topdressing should be applied to all summer crops.

Fourth, in order to ensure strong and vigorous seedlings of spring-sown crops, under the conditions of increasing fertilizer and water, it is necessary to hoe early and hoe more often to loosen the soil, remove weeds, and preserve soil moisture, which is conducive to the development of crop roots, and to do a good job in seed mixing, seed soaking, and disease and insect prevention for early-maturing spring-sown crops. In particular, areas with serious underground pests and areas prone to wheat red spiders in previous years must strengthen prior prevention and timely inspection and control work to ensure that production is not reduced due to insect pests.

The instruction said that in areas with a large amount of summer crops, the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels are required to take the lead in firing this first shot, and in areas with fewer summer crops, a secretary or government leader should also be specifically responsible for leadership. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee will organize inspection teams, led by the secretary and the governor, to go to various places to inspect and promote the production upsurge centered on wheat field management and spring plowing.

    河北省领导部门发出进军号召
    苦战三月力争夏季大丰收
    要求各级党委第一书记带头打响第一炮
    本报讯　据河北日报报道：河北大部地区秋麦即将返青，部分早熟作物正在播种。河北省领导部门认为必须抓紧时机，立即造成一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的力争夏季丰收的高潮。24日，河北省委和省人委共同发出指示，要求全民紧张动员起来，把一切农活安排好，把所有劳力组织好，千方百计，克服困难，鏖战三个月，打响第一炮，力争实现夏收粮食八十亿斤，争取一百亿斤的计划。
    1958年河北省农业生产计划最后修订为粮食总产量达到二百五十亿斤，并且争取超过。实现了这个计划，河北省就可以基本上改变缺粮面貌，实现粮食自给。为了实现这个光荣艰巨的增产计划，首先要求今年夏收作物面积扩大到四千五百万亩以上，总产量达到八十亿斤，争取一百亿斤。实现了这个计划，对于进一步地鼓舞广大干部和群众的革命干劲将会起到极其重要的作用，同时也将为实现全年生产计划奠定下巩固的物质基础。
    指示说，打响全年生产大跃进的第一炮，必须广泛地培养大面积丰产田。通过丰产田的先进示范作用进一步带动一般田的普遍增产。小麦丰产田应当进一步扩大，连同其他早熟作物丰产田扩大到二千万亩，平均亩产三百二十斤。实现了这个计划，加上一般增产的二千五百万亩，不仅八十亿斤的产量可以确保，而且一百亿斤的争取指标也有可能实现。
    指示说，在力争夏季作物大丰收的斗争中，对于全面加强田间管理必须紧紧抓住以下几项关键措施，按照生产需要一直贯彻到丰收实现。
    第一，秋麦返青前抓紧时机进行轧麦、耙麦，作好麦田保墒和补苗工作。
    第二，去秋缺雨，冬季少雪，今年春麦底墒更差，因而及时灌水就更成为力争丰收的一项主要措施。各地对现有的和继续发展的水利设施要尽先用于灌溉夏收作物，必须及早作好提水工具的安装和灌溉沟渠的整理，保证浇水及时。
    第三，要求春播早熟作物，大量施足底肥，以促进根系发育，健壮生长；并对所有夏收作物都能普遍施上追肥。
    第四，为保证春播作物的苗壮苗旺，在增肥增水的情况下，必须早锄多锄，作好松土除草保墒，利于作物根系发育，并作好春播早熟作物的拌种浸种防病防虫工作，特别地下虫害严重和历年易生麦红蜘蛛的地区尤须加强事先的预防和及时的检查除治工作，保证不因虫害减产。
    指示说，夏收作物较多的地区，这第一炮要求由各级党委第一书记带头打，夏收作物较少的地区也要由一位书记或政府负责同志专责领导。省委和省人民委员会将组织检查组，由书记、省长率领分赴各地检查推动以麦田管理和春耕生产为中心的生产高潮。
