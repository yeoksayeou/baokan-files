    New Developments in Pastoral Areas
    In the Xilin Gol grasslands of Inner Mongolia, seven new radio stations have recently been added. These were set up by the state to promote a great leap forward in animal husbandry production on the grasslands and to strengthen communication for preventing wind and snow disasters and during the spring lambing season. These seven radio stations have now begun reporting with the existing radio stations on the grasslands.
    These radio stations are located on pastures in this grassland that are inconvenient to reach and far from the league and banner centers. Now, the Mongolian herdsmen here can use the radio stations to tell their superiors about their production situation and what they want to do at any time, and they can also communicate with their relatives in distant places.

    牧区新事
    内蒙古锡林郭勒草原上，最近增设了七座无线电台。这是国家为了促进草原上畜牧业生产大跃进，加强防御风雪和春季接羔期间的通讯联系而架设的。这七座电台，现在已同草原上原有的各电台开始通报。
    这些电台设在这个草原上交通不便、离盟旗中心较远的牧场上。现在，这里的蒙古族牧民，可以通过电台，把他们的生产情况和想要办的事情，随时告诉上级，还可以同自己的远方亲人通讯。
