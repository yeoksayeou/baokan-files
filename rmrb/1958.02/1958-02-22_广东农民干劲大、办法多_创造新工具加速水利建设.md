Guangdong Peasants are Enthusiastic and Resourceful, Creating New Tools to Accelerate Water Conservancy Construction

    (Our report) Guangdong Province's peasants in many areas have ingeniously improved labor tools and operation methods, increasing labor efficiency several times over, greatly accelerating the progress of water conservancy projects. Now, on water conservancy construction sites, one can see wooden-wheeled carts rattling through the crowds of workers; baskets of earth swiftly gliding along overhead iron wires; and even small boats fitted with wooden wheels rolling on land. Draft cattle, which were not usually worked in winter, have also been brought in to repair water conservancy projects.

    According to reports from various localities, the following tools and operation methods have been widely promoted: in terms of soil extraction, explosives are used to loosen and break up the soil, saving a lot of manual digging labor; oxen are used to plow the soil instead of using hoes to dig. In terms of soil transportation, many places are pulling iron wires across the construction site to transport soil from the air. The method of converting old timber and woodenware into wheelbarrows, two-wheeled handcarts, or ox-drawn carts to transport soil is almost universal throughout the province. Among them, Shaoguan Prefecture has promoted this throughout the region, and the efficiency is three to four times higher than carrying by shoulder. In some villages in Xinhui and Zhongshan counties, mud boats were lifted ashore and converted into ox-drawn mud carts, which can transport 50 cubic meters of soil per day, increasing efficiency by twelve times. In terms of excavating waterways and ditches, Zhongshan, Shunde, Nanhai, Sanshui, and other counties have adopted the method of using oxen to plow the soil for ditch and river excavation, increasing efficiency from the original six cubic meters per person per day to sixteen cubic meters. Qingyuan County originally had about 8,000 people using pile drivers. Since the promotion of the frame-supported pile driver operation method created by Longtan Township, more than 5,000 laborers in the county have been released from the pile driving work. In addition, some places also use cattle treading and cattle-drawn stone rollers to compact the soil.

    According to the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee, in the past, the efficiency of water conservancy construction in the area was generally 0.8 to 1.2 cubic meters per worker. Now, due to the improvement of labor organization, especially the widespread improvement of tools and operation methods, it has been increased to 2.5 cubic meters per worker. Qingyuan County even reaches 3.8 cubic meters. Due to the doubled efficiency, the 110 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects in the area can be completed in two months instead of four months, and about 80 million workdays can be saved for investment in fertilizer accumulation and winter sideline production. The Foshan Prefectural Committee recently also notified various localities, requiring the experience and measures of improving tools and operation methods in this water conservancy construction to be promoted to fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, and other work.

    广东农民干劲大、办法多
    创造新工具加速水利建设
    本报讯　广东省许多地方的农民别出心裁地改良了劳动工具和改进了操作方法，几倍几倍地提高了劳动效率，使水利工程的进度大大加快。现在，在水利工地上，人们到处可以看见木轮车夹在劳动的人流中咿哑地行驶着；一条条架空铁线上，飞快地滑动着一筐筐的泥土；甚至还可以看见河里的小船装上木轮在陆地上滚动；一向在冬天不出勤的耕牛也被赶来修水利。
    据各地反映，下面这些工具和操作方法推广比较普遍：在取土方面，有用炸药把泥土炸松炸碎以节省大量掘土人力的，有用牛力犁土代替锄头挖土的；在运土方面，不少地方在工地上空拉扯铁线，从空中运土。用旧木料、木器改装成独轮、双轮手推车或牛拉车来运土的方法，几乎遍及全省，其中韶关专区已全区推广，效率比肩挑提高了三、四倍。新会、中山两县有些乡村把泥船抬到岸上，改成牛拉泥车，每天可运土五十方，提高效率十二倍。在开挖水道河沟方面，中山、顺德、南海、三水等县已采用耕牛犁土开沟开河，效率从原来每人每天挖六土方提高到十六土方。清远县原来全县有约八千人打硪，自从推广了龙潭乡创造的搭架吊硪的操作方法以后，全县就有五千多个劳动力从打硪工作中抽调出来。此外，有些地方还采用牛踏和牛拉石滚石碌的办法来压土。
    据韶关地委反映：历年来该区兴修水利的效率每个人工一般能做零点八到一点二个土方，现在由于改善劳动组织、特别是普遍改良工具和改进操作方法后，已提高到每工能做二点五个土方。清远县还高达三点八个土方。由于效率倍加，该区一亿一千万土方的水利工程便可由需时四月缩短为两个月完成，并且节约出约八千多万个工用来投入积肥和冬季副业等生产上去。佛山地委最近还通报各地，要求把这次兴修水利中改良工具和改进操作方法的经验措施，推广到积肥、改良土壤等工作上去。
