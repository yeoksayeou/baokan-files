Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: According to an article recently published in the Soviet "Literary Gazette," the Crimean region of the Soviet Union adopted a new irrigation method called "Underground Rain" last year. Using a small amount of water, it helped more than 15,000 hectares of vineyards overcome a severe drought, rare even in this arid region.

Last summer, Crimea was extremely dry, and even artificial irrigation methods were ineffective. Irrigating each grape vine required at least 40 to 50 liters of water, and even this large amount of water source for irrigation was lacking. Later, local agricultural workers used a device called a hydraulic drill to drill a 60-centimeter-deep hole next to the roots of each grape bush and injected three to five liters of water into each hole. As a result, the grapes quickly recovered. Using this method, water consumption and transportation costs were only one-twentieth of those of surface irrigation methods. This is the so-called "Underground Rain" irrigation method.

Soviet scientists once experimented by drilling several rows of 60-centimeter-deep holes in the ground and digging them up for inspection 12 to 48 hours after watering. The results showed that the moisture content was even higher than the original amount of water injected. This phenomenon is similar to the phenomenon that soil in summer nights becomes moist due to the condensation of water vapor contained in the atmosphere and soil air. The water injected into the soil with a hydraulic drill attracts water vapor from the soil and the air in the atmosphere to the roots of the plants; the water vapor flocks to the "storage irrigation area" and condenses into small water droplets there. The result is like a slow and even dew rain that moistens the soil.

### 苏联防旱新法——“地下雨”

　　苏联防旱新法——“地下雨”
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　据苏联“文学报”最近发表的一篇文章报道，苏联克里米亚地区去年采用了一种名叫“地下雨”的新式灌溉方法，用少量的水使一万五千多公顷葡萄园战胜了连这个干旱地区都少有的一次大旱灾。
    去年夏天，克里米亚十分干旱，采用人工灌溉的方法都不行，灌溉每一株葡萄至少需要四十到五十公升水，而这里连灌溉所需的这么大量的水源也缺乏。后来，当地农业工作人员用一种叫水力钻机的装置在每一丛葡萄的根旁钻了一个六十公分深的钻眼，并在每个钻眼注入三到五公升水。结果，葡萄很快就复苏了。用这种方法，水的消耗和运水时的开销只是地面灌溉方法的二十分之一。这就是所谓“地下雨”灌溉法。
    苏联科学家曾经试验，在地上打几行深六十公分的钻眼，在注水十二到四十八小时以后挖开检查，结果发现其中所含的水分还多于原先灌入的水。这种现象是同夏夜土壤会因冷凝大气和土壤中的空气所含有的水汽而潮润起来的现象相类似的。用水力钻机注入土壤的水，把土壤和大气中的空气里的水汽吸引到植物的根旁；水汽纷纷向“蓄灌区”拥来，在这里冷凝为小水滴。结果就像是下了缓慢而均匀地润湿土壤的露雨一样了。
