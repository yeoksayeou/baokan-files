I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1958," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee's "Report on Current Language Reform Work and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Program," and I recommend that the Congress adopt them.

Although Hubei Province is one of the major cotton-producing areas in the country, in the past, cotton yields were consistently low, quality was poor, with impurity content reaching 10% and moisture content as high as 20% or more. Most cotton could only be spun into coarse yarn of around 10 counts, and spinning mills shook their heads at Hubei cotton. Because of this, there was doubt as to whether Hubei was suitable for growing cotton.

　　Cotton Achieves Unprecedented Bumper Harvest, High-Yielding Models Emerge

The facts have provided an affirmative answer. Hubei is not only suitable for growing cotton, but also has enormous potential for developing cotton production. In recent years, especially in the two years since agricultural cooperativization, under the correct leadership of the Central Government and the joint efforts of the people of the province, Hubei's cotton production, like that of other provinces in the country, has seen a leap forward in development, and the situation of low yields is beginning to change. In 1957, total cotton production reached 4.3 million dan, an increase of 10.62% over 1956 and 62% over 1952. Farmers in Macheng County happily said: "A hundred acres of sand turned into fertile fields, vast cotton fields rolling with snow. Despite a severe drought of ninety days this year, cotton and wheat yields reached 1,000 catties per mu."

While achieving unprecedented bumper cotton harvests, many high-yielding models have emerged. Macheng and Guangji counties averaged 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, Huangmei County averaged 94 catties per mu, and seven counties, including Tianmen, averaged over 70 catties per mu. Throughout the province, there were 100 townships with 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, 1,639 cooperatives with 100 catties per mu, and 1.5 million mu with 100 catties per mu. These various high-yielding models are distributed in various regions, whether mountainous, hilly, or plain areas, all have high-yielding banners, and all have created valuable experience in increasing production. For example, Jiufeng First Cooperative of Louzhai Township in the mountainous area of Xinzhou County had 48 mu of cotton fields scattered into more than 100 plots, intercropped with wheat, yielding 222 catties of wheat and 140 catties of ginned cotton per mu.

Cotton quality has also greatly improved in recent years. Cotton exceeding one inch in length has increased from 11.23% in 1952 to 93% in 1957 throughout the province; the average length is now above one inch; moisture content has decreased from 11% in 1952 to 9%; and impurity content has decreased from 3.5% in 1952 to 1.2%. The situation of only being able to spin coarse yarn and weave coarse cloth has been fundamentally changed.

Increased cotton production will powerfully support national economic construction. As of January 20th this year, the cotton procurement volume in 1957 has reached 3.62 million dan. We are confident of procuring 3.8 million dan, exceeding the national allocation of 3.1 million dan by 22.5%, and an increase of more than 60% over 1952.

　　Not Relying on Favorable Weather, Increased Production Has the Following Reasons

Have the consecutive bumper harvests of cotton in recent years been due to good natural conditions and favorable weather? On the contrary, in 1957, the entire province experienced a severe summer and autumn drought for more than 90 days, the length and extent of which was rare in decades. The cotton planting area in 1957 was 8.76 million mu, an increase of 360,000 mu over 1952, but a decrease of 140,000 mu compared to the 8.9 million mu in 1956, while the total output increased by 500,000 dan. So what are the reasons? The realization of agricultural cooperativization, the farmers have exerted their creativity

First of all, it lies in the realization of agricultural cooperativization. Under the victorious inspiration of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the broad masses of peasants have greatly brought into play their enthusiasm for production and creativity. Various cotton production increase measures that could not be promoted at all or could not be thoroughly promoted before cooperativization have been universally and deeply promoted after cooperativization. In the three years before cooperativization, the total cotton production in our province only increased by 240,000 dan, while in the two years after cooperativization, it increased by 1.63 million dan. In 1957, 39 counties in the province increased production by 30% to 100% or more compared to 1955. From this, it can be seen that even in the first two years of realizing agricultural cooperativization, it fully demonstrated the superiority of the cooperative system.

　　Strong Support from the Party and Government

Secondly, the policy put forward by the Party and the government of "giving priority to the development of grain production, while simultaneously developing cotton and various cash crops" is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous increase in cotton production. The tremendous assistance given to farmers in supporting cotton farmers' production, implementing cotton pre-purchase, helping cotton farmers promote advanced production increase experience, promoting improved varieties, supplying pest control machinery and chemicals, chemical fertilizers, and new agricultural tools, issuing loans, and awarding cotton sales has played a significant role.

　　Master the Characteristics of Cotton-Wheat Double Cropping

The third is to master the characteristics of cotton-wheat double cropping; highlight and grasp the solution of various contradictions in cotton-wheat double cropping, and ensure increased production and bumper harvests of cotton-wheat double cropping. In recent years, we have first adopted the method of appropriately reducing the wheat planting area and appropriately increasing the barley-cotton double cropping and broad bean-cotton double cropping in areas where cotton and wheat are too concentrated, in order to alleviate the tension of insufficient labor during the wheat harvest; secondly, we have changed from wheat broadcasting and equal-row strip sowing to wide-narrow row strip sowing, which is an important link in overcoming the difficulty of cotton seedling management in wheat fields. Improving cotton seedling management in wheat rows mainly involves promoting the experience of loosening the soil and applying base fertilizer in wheat rows before cotton sowing, and weeding cotton seedlings early in the morning in wheat rows, so that cotton seeds germinate quickly and cotton seedlings grow strongly. In addition, promoting the early-maturing and high-yielding Nandai 2419 wheat variety also has a great effect on overcoming the contradictions of cotton-wheat double cropping.

　　Early Sowing, Close Planting, Phased Topdressing, Full Stand of Strong Seedlings

The fourth is to resolutely and consistently promote comprehensive production increase measures centered on appropriate early sowing, close planting, phased topdressing, and full stand of strong seedlings. Cotton sowing in 1957 was generally 15 to 20 days earlier than in previous years, which not only made full use of the growing season, increasing cotton production, but also created conditions for timely wheat planting. Cotton close planting has also been greatly improved, with an average increase of 400 to 500 plants per mu on the original basis. Increasing the application of base fertilizer and promoting multiple topdressing with the "eat little and often" method, and vigorously carrying out the full stand of strong seedlings movement in the cotton seedling stage, cultivating and earthing up, and timely pruning, also played a significant role in ensuring cotton production increase.

　　Overcome Waterlogging, Drought, and Pests

The fifth is to overcome waterlogging, drought, and pests. Last summer and autumn, the people of the entire province carried out a large-scale, persistent, day-and-night drought resistance struggle, and finally overcame the drought. The struggle against pests has also generally attracted attention. Prevent pests if there are no pests, treat pests if there are pests, generally spray medicine, and immediately eliminate pests when they are discovered. Macheng is called "One O'Clock Victory." In 1957, pest control was generally carried out five or six times in various places. Due to the strengthening of pest prevention and control work, the curled and broken red leaves of cotton in the major cotton-producing areas have almost disappeared.

　　Party Committee Responsible Cadres in Charge of Sub-Districts, Specific Leadership, Organize Visits and Comparisons

The sixth is to realize the specific leadership of cotton production. In the main cotton-producing areas, there are full-time Party committee responsible cadres in charge of cotton production, responsible for sub-districts, and organize visits and comparisons in a timely manner, so that the backward can quickly catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become more advanced. In the second half of 1957, cadres in most areas of the province, from the county party secretary down to the cooperative director and production team leader, planted experimental fields. With experimental fields, cadres have feelings for production, love the fields, love the crops, and love labor. Some watch three times in the morning and evening, and eat with a bowl in their hands in the experimental fields. The promotion of advanced experience and production increase measures no longer uses the previous method of transmission, arrangement, or even forced orders, but first experiments in their own experimental fields. If successful, they organize visits and comparisons in a timely manner and promote them widely. Experimental fields not only enable cadres to learn production, but also have emerged many high-yielding models. Moreover, participating in production, leading production, the work style of cadres has changed, and the prestige of cadres among the masses has also greatly increased. Some cadres were satirized by the masses in the past as "inspectors," "foreign sweet potatoes," and "foreign experts." Now the masses call them "technicians," "local experts," and "Team Leader Yang."

　　Build Water Conservancy, Accumulate More Fertilizer, Production Will Have Another Great Leap Forward

Although our province has achieved unprecedented bumper cotton harvests in the past two years, the balance between regions is still very uneven, and many production increase measures have not been promoted widely and deeply enough. "Strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production" is the glorious and arduous task of the people of the province in 1958. This year, the province's total cotton production plan is to reach 5 million dan. After the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the competition slogan of "Learn from Macheng, catch up with or surpass Macheng," it also proposed the agricultural production increase competition goal of 1,000, 100, and 10,000 catties (that is, an average yield of 1,000 catties of grain per mu, 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, and 10,000 catties of grain per household) throughout the province. Five cotton-producing areas have already proposed to achieve 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu in three areas, and two areas will complete the five-year plan target in one year. Of course, we are not without difficulties, especially in the supply of chemical fertilizers, which cannot fully meet the needs at present. The supply of advanced agricultural tools and power machinery is still very small, which will inevitably have a certain impact on cotton production increase. However, we have not been daunted by difficulties. Since the beginning of winter, the people of the province have launched an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movement. As long as we strengthen leadership, go all out, constantly overcome conservative thinking, and fully mobilize the masses, we are fully confident of completing the 5 million dan cotton production task in 1958 and strive to complete 5.5 million to 6 million dan, and have another great leap forward in cotton production.

　　沙滩变良田　棉海滚雪团
    聂国青代表谈湖北棉花连续丰收的原因
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”和中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，建议大会通过。
    湖北省虽然是全国的主要产棉区之一，但在过去棉花一向是产量很低，品质很差，杂质含量达到百分之十，水份高的达到百分之二十以上，大部棉花只能纺十支左右的粗纱，纱厂见到湖北棉花就摇头。因之，曾有过这样的怀疑：湖北是否适宜种棉花？
    棉花获得空前丰收  出现高额丰产典型
    事实做了肯定的回答。湖北不仅适宜种棉花，而且发展棉花生产的潜力是巨大的。近几年来，特别是农业合作化以后两年来，在中央的正确领导和全省人民的共同努力下，与全国各省一样，湖北棉花生产出现了跃进的发展形势，低产面貌在开始改变。一九五七年棉花总产量达到四百三十万担，比一九五六年增产百分之十点六二，比一九五二年增产百分之六十二。麻城县农民喜悦的说：“百亩沙滩变良田，茫茫棉海滚雪团，今年大旱九十天，棉麦亩产到一千。”
    在获得棉花空前丰收的同时，出现了很多高额丰产典型。全县平均亩产皮棉一百斤的有麻城、广济两个县，平均亩产九十四斤的有黄梅一个县，平均亩产七十斤以上的有天门等七个县。全省皮棉百斤乡有一百个，百斤社有一千六百三十九个，百斤亩有一百五十万亩。这些各种高额丰产典型分布在各种不同的地区，无论是山区、丘陵区、平原区都有高额丰产的旗帜，都创造出宝贵的增产经验，如新洲县山区楼寨乡久峰一社有四十八亩棉田分散为一百多块，间作小麦亩产二百二十二斤，皮棉一百四十斤。
    棉花质量几年来也有很大提高，全省超过一英寸的棉花已由一九五二年的百分之十一点二三，上升到一九五七年的百分之九十三；平均长度都在一英寸以上，水份由一九五二年的百分之十一下降到百分之九；含杂率由一九五二年的百分之三点五下降到百分之一点二。只能纺粗纱、织粗布的面貌已经得到根本改变。
    棉花增产了将有力的支援国家的经济建设。一九五七年棉花收购量截至今年元月二十日为止，已经完成三百六十二万担。我们有信心收购到三百八十万担，将比国家分配任务三百一十万担超过百分之二十二点五，比一九五二年增长百分之六十以上。
    不靠风调和雨顺  增产有以下原因
    几年来棉花连续获得丰收是不是自然条件很好风调雨顺呢？恰恰相反，一九五七年全省夏秋严重干旱九十余天，干旱时间之长面积之广是几十年来所罕见；棉花播种面积一九五七年为八百七十六万亩，虽比一九五二年增加三十六万亩，但比一九五六年的八百九十万亩则减少了十四万亩，而总产量却增加了五十万担。那么原因何在呢？实现了农业合作化，农民发挥了创造性
    首先在于实现了农业合作化。广大农民群众在农业社会主义改造的胜利鼓舞下，大大发挥了生产积极性和创造性，合作化前根本无法推行或不能彻底推行的各项棉花增产措施，合作化以后都得到了普遍深入的推行。合作化的前三年，我省棉花总产量只增加了二十四万担，而合作化以后的两年内却增加了一百六十三万担，全省一九五七年比一九五五年增产百分之三十到一倍以上的有三十九个县，由此可见，即使是在实现农业合作化的头两年，就充分显示了合作化制度的优越性。
    党和政府大力支持
    其次，党和政府提出的“优先发展粮食生产，同时发展棉花和各种经济作物”的方针，是棉花不断增产的根本保证，在扶植棉农生产，实行棉花预购，帮助棉农推广先进增产经验，推广良种，供应治虫药械、化学肥料和新式农具，发放贷款，售棉奖励等方面给农民的巨大援助起了重大的作用。
    掌握棉麦两熟特点
    第三是掌握棉麦两熟的特点；突出抓住解决棉麦两熟的各种矛盾，保证了棉麦两熟增产丰收。几年来，我们首先在棉花小麦过于集中的地区，采用了适当减少一部分小麦播种面积，适当增加一部分大麦棉花两熟和蚕豆棉花两熟的办法，以减轻麦收时劳动力不够的紧张程度；其次是改小麦撒播和等行条播为宽窄行条播，这是克服麦田棉苗管理困难的重要环节。改进麦行的棉苗管理，主要是推行了棉花播种前在麦行里松土施底肥，和麦行早间棉苗锄草的经验，使棉子迅速发芽，棉苗生长健壮。此外，推行麦收时快割小麦，快锄草灭荏、快定苗、快追肥提苗的“四快”和推广早熟丰产的南大2419小麦品种，对克服棉麦两熟矛盾也有很大作用。
    早播、密植、分期追肥、全苗壮苗
    第四是坚决的一贯到底的推行适当早播、密植、分期追肥，全苗壮苗为中心的综合性增产措施。一九五七年棉花播种一般比往年提早十五至二十天，不仅充分利用了生长季节，使棉花增产，并为适时种麦创造了条件，棉花密植也有了很大的改进，一般的在原有基础上每亩平均增加四五百株，增施底肥并推行多次追肥“少吃多餐”的措施，棉花苗期大力开展全苗壮苗运动，中耕培土，适时整枝，对保证棉花增产也有很大作用。
    战胜水旱灾和虫害
    第五是战胜水旱灾和虫害。去年夏秋两季全省人民进行了大规模的持久的夜以继日的抗旱斗争，终于战胜了旱灾。和虫害的斗争也普遍的引起了重视，无虫就防，有虫就治，普遍打药，发现虫害立即扑灭，麻城叫“一点钟胜利”，一九五七年各地一般治虫达五、六次之多，由于加强了防虫治虫工作，各主要产棉区棉花卷曲残破的红叶子几乎不见了。
    党委负责干部分片负责，具体领导，组织参观评比
    第六是实现了对棉花生产的具体领导。在主要产棉区都有专管棉花生产的专职党委负责干部，分片负责，并及时组织参观评比，使落后迅速赶上先进，先进更先进。一九五七年下半年，全省大部地区的干部，上自县委书记，下到社主任、生产队长，都种了试验田，种了试验田，干部和生产就有了感情，爱上了田地、爱上了庄稼、爱上了劳动，有的早晚看三次，吃饭端着碗也在试验田里。推广先进经验和增产措施，不再采用以前的传达布置甚至强迫命令的办法了，而是首先在自己的试验田里试验，成功了，再及时组织参观评比，广泛推广。试验田不仅使干部学会生产，出现了很多高额丰产的典型；而且参加生产，领导生产，工作作风转变了，干部在群众中的威信也大大提高。有的干部过去被群众讽刺为“检查官”“洋苕儿”“杨外行”，现在群众叫“技术员”“杨内行”“杨队长”了。
    兴修水利　多积肥料  生产再来一个大跃进
    两年来，我省棉花虽然获得了空前丰收，但各地区间还很不平衡，有很多增产措施推行得还不广泛深入。“争取农业生产大跃进”这是全省人民一九五八年的光荣而又艰巨的任务。今年全省棉花总产量计划达到五百万担，中共湖北省委提出“向麻城学习，赶上或超过麻城”的竞赛口号后，并在全省提出千、百、万斤（就是粮食平均亩产千斤，皮棉亩产百斤，每户粮食一万斤）的农业增产竞赛的奋斗目标，五个产棉专区，已经有三个专区提出要达到皮棉百斤区，有两个专区要五年计划指标一年完成。当然我们也不是没有困难的，特别是在化学肥料的供应上，目前还不能充分的满足需要，先进农具和动力机械的供应还很少，这些势将对棉花的增产有一定影响。但是我们并没有被困难吓倒，入冬以来，全省人民开展了空前规模的千军万马的大搞水利和积肥运动。只要我们加强领导，鼓足干劲，不断克服保守思想，充分发动群众，一九五八年内完成五百万担棉花生产任务是完全有把握的，并争取完成五百五十到六百万担，再来个棉花生产大跃进。
