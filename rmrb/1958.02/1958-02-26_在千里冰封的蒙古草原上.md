    On the Frozen Mongolian Grassland
    By Our Correspondent Féng Yè

    At the end of 1957, we visited three provinces in the eastern grasslands of Mongolia, traveling five thousand li back and forth across the frozen land. Although the trip was hurried, we saw the Mongolian people working diligently in the sub-zero temperatures of ten to twenty degrees below. The vast grasslands covered in white snow offered a unique and beautiful scenery.
    Cities on the Grassland
    Only those who have traveled the grasslands can truly understand their vastness and breadth. The Mongolian grassland is precisely like this. Cars can travel for one or two hundred li without seeing a single household. Occasionally, one sees three to five yurts and a herd of cattle and sheep, which flash by as the car passes, leaving only endless land behind. Only when reaching a county town, provincial capital, farm, or mine can one find more concentrated settlements.

    Building cities on the sparsely populated grasslands is an arduous task. However, the diligent people have built cities with their own hands, and these grassland cities have become the political, economic, and cultural centers of the grasslands.

    We visited the provincial capitals of Choibalsan, Khentii, and Sukhbaatar provinces, and also passed through some county towns. All these cities allowed us to appreciate their changes and development. Even small county towns with only a few hundred residents have schools, hospitals, shops, theaters (or clubs), as well as small factories and other cultural and economic departments. The provincial capitals have all been fitted with electric lights. Whenever we approached a provincial city at night, we could see the bright lights shining on the grassland.

    Baruun-Urt, the capital of Sukhbaatar province, is a new city built in a semi-Gobi area with only a little over a decade of history. The Provincial Party Secretary told us that just over ten years ago, this place was still a desert. Now, it has become a city with more than four thousand people. In this new city, we saw shops, clubs, canteens, and residences built in recent years. In 1955, Chinese workers came here and, together with Mongolian workers, helped build this new Gobi city. We also visited a middle school here. To cultivate students' labor habits, the school opened an agricultural experiment field, where students learned to trial-plant vegetables and grains. Before winter, the students also helped nearby pastoral production cooperatives store several thousand tons of hay.

    The changes in Choibalsan are also astonishing. Before the revolution, this place was mainly inhabited by lamas. Now, it has been built into the second largest city in Mongolia, with more than 20,000 residents. It has a metallurgical company, a wool-washing factory, a goods import and export station, and a broad-gauge railway connecting to the Soviet Union, which plays a significant role in the foreign exchange of goods for the three eastern provinces. In the eastern part of the city, a new building is under construction on the square. This is a flour mill being built with Soviet assistance to Mongolia, and the bricks used for the factory building are imported from China. This factory will be completed ahead of schedule in 1958. To meet the raw material needs of the factory, the acreage of grain sowing will be expanded on the grassland, and the flour needed by the people will gradually become self-sufficient. At the construction site, we saw Chinese workers who came here to help with the construction, working tirelessly alongside Mongolian workers despite the harsh winter cold on the grassland.

    How the grasslands are changing, and how the cities on the grasslands are constantly growing!

    Mining Areas and Farms

    In recent years, the Mongolian people have been conducting mineral exploration and mining work under the great grasslands. The metallurgical company in Choibalsan leads the mining work in the eastern region.

    In Khentii province, we visited a fluorite mine. Near the mine shaft, we saw mountains of accumulated ore, which is said to be of very good quality. A new mine shaft is under construction, and the power equipment is already installed. This new mine shaft will use machine mining.

    This fluorite mining area was built during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The development of the mining area is very rapid, and it has become a lively area on the grassland. The miners live in newly built wooden houses, which are equipped with stoves and electric lights. The shops have daily necessities needed by the workers. The mine director said that, with the help of Soviet experts, Mongolian miners have mastered the technology. The production tasks for 1957 have been overfulfilled. Now, the workers are launching a socialist production competition to welcome the Thirteenth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

    On the way back to Ulaanbaatar, we also visited a tungsten mine. The mine director, who had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet expert warmly received us. This was originally a grassland. After tungsten was mined, many houses were built around the mining area, and the population also increased. Although the sky was close to dusk, the mine director happily led us around the site. We saw everything from the mine's machinery and ore washing room to the miners' bathhouse.

    In Choibalsan province, we also visited the Tamsagbulag farm, one of the three state-owned farms in the province.

    Tamsagbulag is the terminus of a narrow-gauge railway connecting to Choibalsan. This is the eastern border of Mongolia. In 1939, the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, in which the Mongolian people defeated the Japanese fascist aggressors, took place near here. The old barracks have now been used for peaceful production and construction. The farm's offices and some of the dormitories are the old barracks buildings.

    The farm was established in 1954. It has more than 20,000 head of livestock, which are currently grazing on winter pastures. The annual livestock breeding plan has already been overfulfilled. In 1957, most individual herdsmen in the province did not complete their livestock increase plans, but the state-owned farm fully demonstrated its superiority.

    The farm sowed crops on more than 1,200 hectares of land, and the annual production plan has also been overfulfilled. The farm director told us that in the previous two years, this place could only produce three tons of potatoes per hectare. In 1957, the yield had increased to ten tons. Chinese workers helped design cellars where potatoes can be stored well, which further improved the production enthusiasm of the farm workers. In 1958, the farm will also expand its cultivated area to prepare to supply raw materials to the Choibalsan flour mill.

    In recent years, the Mongolian people have attached importance to the development of agriculture, and the cultivated area of farms and cooperatives is gradually expanding. Mongolia has a large amount of land available for utilization, and the development prospects of agriculture are great. Like the Tamsagbulag farm, although the cultivated land has been expanded to more than 1,000 hectares, it only accounts for a small part of the arable land, and vast land is waiting to be reclaimed and utilized.

    In the evening, we watched a song and dance performance at the farm club. Shepherdesses, tractor drivers, and Chinese workers went on stage together to perform wonderful programs. We deeply felt the deep friendship established between the workers of the two countries in their work.

### 在千里冰封的蒙古草原上

    在千里冰封的蒙古草原上
    本报记者　逢烨
    1957年的岁末，我们去蒙古东部草原的三个省作了一次访问。在千里冰封的大地上，来回五千里。虽然来去匆匆，但我们看到蒙古人民在冒着零下一、二十度的严寒辛勤劳动。白雪复盖的茫茫草原，别是一番秀丽风光。
    草原上的城市
    到过草原旅行的人，才会理解草原的辽阔宽广，蒙古草原就是这样。汽车在草原上奔驰，有时一、二百里见不到一户人家。有时看见三、五蒙古包和一群牛羊，车子一闪而过，依然是无尽的土地。到了县城、省会，或是农场、矿山，才能见到比较集中的人家。
    在地广人稀的草原上建设城市，是一件艰巨的工作。但是，勤劳的人民用他们的双手把一座座城市建设起来了，草原城市成为草原上的政治、经济和文化中心。
    我们访问过乔巴山、肯特和苏赫巴托尔三个省的省会，还路过了一些县城，所有这些城市都使我们体会到它们的变化和发展。即使是只有几百个居民的小县城，也都有学校、医院、商店、剧院（或俱乐部）以及小型的工厂等各种文化、经济部门。省会都安装了电灯。每当我们在夜晚临近省城时，就看得见草原上闪耀着的明亮灯火。
    苏赫巴托尔省的省会巴勒浩特，是在半戈壁地区建立的新城市，才有十多年的历史。省党委书记告诉我们，十多年前，这里还是一片荒漠，现在已经成为一个有四千多人的城市了。在这个新城里，我们看到了最近几年内建设起来的商店、俱乐部、食堂和住宅。1955年，中国工人来到这里，他们和蒙古工人一道，帮助建设着这个戈壁新城。我们在这里还参观了一所中学。学校为了培养学生的劳动习惯，曾经开辟了一个农业试验场，学生们学习着试种蔬菜和谷物。入冬前，学生们还帮助附近的牧业生产合作社贮备了好几千吨干草。
    乔巴山市的变化也是惊人的。革命前，这里主要是喇嘛住的地方。现在已建设成蒙古目前的第二个大城市，全市有两万多居民。这里有冶金公司、洗毛工厂、物资进出口站，还有一条宽轨铁路通往苏联，这对东部三省的物资对外交流起了很大的作用。市区东面，一所新楼房正在广场上兴建，这是苏联帮助蒙古建设的一座面粉厂，厂房所用的砖是从中国进口的。这个厂1958年就要提前完工。为了满足工厂原料的需要，草原上将扩大谷物的播种面积，人们需要的面粉也将要逐步自给。在工地上，我们看到来这里帮助建设的中国工人，他们和蒙古工人们一道，冒着草原上的冬季严寒，不停地施工。
    草原在怎样地变化着啊，草原城市在怎样不断地成长着啊！
    矿区和农场
    蒙古人民最近几年来进行着大草原下的矿产探采工作。设在乔巴山市的冶金公司，领导着东部地区的采矿工作。
    我们在肯特省访问了一个开采萤石的矿区。我们在矿井附近看见堆积如山的矿石，据说这些矿石的质量很好。一个新的矿井正在修建，动力设备已安装就绪，这个新矿井将使用机器开采。
    这个萤石矿区是在第二个五年计划期间兴建的，矿区的发展很快，已经成为草原上的一个热闹地区了。矿工们住着新建的木结构房屋，屋里安装了火炉和电灯。商店里有工人们需要的日用百货。矿长说，在苏联专家的帮助下，蒙古矿工已经掌握了技术。1957年的生产任务已经超额完成了。现在，工人们为了迎接蒙古人民革命党的第十三次代表大会，正在开展着社会主义的生产竞赛。
    返回乌兰巴托的途中，我们还参观了一个钨矿。新从苏联学习归来的矿长和一位苏联专家热情地接待了我们。这里原来也是一片草原，开采钨矿后，矿区周围盖起很多房屋，人口也多起来了。天色虽然已近薄暮，矿长仍高兴地领我们到处参观。我们从矿的机器设备、洗矿间一直看到矿工们的洗澡间。
    在乔巴山省，我们还参观了全省三个国营农场之一的塔木斯克农场。
    塔木斯克，是一条连接乔巴山市的狭轨铁路的终点站。这里是蒙古的东部边境，1939年，蒙古人民击溃日本法西斯侵略军的哈拉哈战役就是在这附近进行的。旧日的兵营现在已被利用来作和平的生产建设，农场的办公室和一部分宿舍就是旧兵营的建筑物。
    农场是在1954年建立的。现有两万多头牲畜，目前正在冬季牧场上放牧，全年的牲畜增殖计划已经超额完成了。1957年全省的多数个体牧民都没有完成增畜计划，国营农场却充分地显示了它的优越性。
    农场在一千二百多公顷土地上播种了庄稼，全年的生产计划也已经超额完成。场长告诉我们，前两年，这里每公顷土地只能出产三吨马铃薯，1957年，生产量已提高到十吨。中国工人们帮助设计了地窖，马铃薯可以很好地贮藏起来，这更加提高了农场工人们的生产情绪。1958年，农场还要扩大耕地面积，准备供应乔巴山市面粉厂的原料需要。
    最近几年来，蒙古人民重视发展农业，农场和合作社的耕地面积正在逐步扩大。蒙古有大量的可供利用的土地，农业的发展前途很大。像塔木斯克农场，耕地虽已扩充到一千多公顷，但是只占可耕地的一小部分，广大土地正待开垦利用。
    晚上，我们在农场俱乐部看了一场歌舞表演。牧羊姑娘、拖拉机手和中国工人一块上台表演了精采的节目。我们深深地体会了两国工人在工作中建立的深厚友谊。
