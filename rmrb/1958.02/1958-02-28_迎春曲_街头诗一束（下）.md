Ode to Spring
    ——A Collection of Street Poems (Part 2)
    Tian Jian

    The Mountain is Speaking
    Flowers bloom on the mountain, the mountain is speaking:
    I was once a barren hill too.
    What can suppress me is not the rocks,
    But the hands of giants;
    What can awaken me is not the wind and sand,
    But the footsteps of heroes.

    Time
    Take a break during planting,
    Skip a meal when idle;
    Time is gold,
    Diligence is wealth.

    Man Will Conquer Nature
    The cold cannot chill our ardent hearts,
    The frozen earth cannot freeze our determination,
    Ice and snow cannot cover our confidence,
    Gales cannot break our perseverance.
    We say: Man will conquer nature,
    Working people are omnipotent.

    Lightning
    Lightning flashes across the mountains and fields,
    Look at that silver gleam—
    Is that really lightning?
    Those are countless iron hoes,
    Within minutes,
    Splitting a high ridge.

    To the Orchard Team
    Plant a peach tree this year,
    Too many peaches to eat in future years;
    Newly planted thousands of acres of fruit trees,
    Too many fruit trees to count.
    I want to sing an Ode to Spring,
    Wishing you a bountiful harvest!

    Determination
    As long as we have determination,
    We can move barren mountains;
    Beneath the layers of ten thousand years of rock,
    We can catch the “Dragon King.”

    Inscription for the Windbreak Forest
    We will build a ladder to the sky,
    And launch a great battle with wind and sand.
    What is the ladder to the sky? It is—
    Jungles and verdant branches.

    Barren Beach and Apple Trees
    On this barren beach,
    Don't say there are no treasures;
    The apple trees planted a few years ago,
    Are they not better than treasures?
    Plant golden trees on the barren beach,
    Golden birds fly on the branches.

    Old Man Wang
    ——A gift to a member of the Nanshuiquan Agricultural Cooperative
    Old Man Wang's hands,
    Several cracks like ravines,
    He still digs the big canal as usual,
    His hands constantly shoveling soil.
    He still works from morning till night,
    His face full of smiles, without worry.
    Legend says Yu Gong could move mountains,
    He is more capable than Yu Gong.
    He is a bachelor,
    The orchard is his companion.
    He has planted so many fruit trees for the people,
    But he himself has eaten only a few fruits.

    Paradise
    I see paradise on earth,
    Right beside the commune members,
    As long as the hoe rings out,
    The garden gate will open to us.
    Sunflowers sway golden cups,
    Red crabapples can be made into fruit pulp.
    People, raise your golden cups,
    Build paradise on earth,

    Untitled
    I. Water has a way, soil has a home,
    Stones are about to move on a large scale.
    When the mind opens,
    Difficulties will be afraid of us.

    II.
    Watching the east wind prevail over the west wind,
    We must make this year better than last year;
    The Party has given us a golden arrow,
    It must pierce through the wilderness.

    To the Archer
    If you want to find a roe deer,
    You must not be afraid to walk difficult roads;
    Only on the highest mountain peak,
    Will the roe deer occasionally turn its head.

    In the Field
    Ice and snow still accumulate in the fields,
    The cuckoo has not yet cried,
    The first people to ring out in the valley,
    Will be able to find the cuckoo.
    They are also singing like cuckoos,
    They are the cuckoos!

    Written in Nanshuiquan, February 1958

    迎春曲
    ——街头诗一束（下）
    田间
    高山在说话
    山上开了花，山在说话：
    我原来也是一座童山、
    能把我压住的不是石头，
    是巨人的双手；
    能把我唤醒的不是风砂，
    是英雄的脚步。
    时间
    耕种时站一站，
    闲时少一顿饭；
    时间就是金子，
    勤劳就是财产。
    人定胜天
    天冷冷不了热心，
    地冻冻不了决心，
    冰雪盖不住信心，
    狂风吹不倒恒心。
    我们说：人定胜天，
    劳动的人是万能。
    闪电
    山野上扯起闪电，
    你看那银光闪闪——
    那儿真的是闪电？
    那是无数的铁铣，
    在几分钟的时间以内，
    把一道上陵劈碎。
    给果木队
    今年栽下一棵桃，
    他年桃子吃不了；
    新栽起千亩果树，
    果树数也难数了。
    我要唱起迎春曲，
    预祝你们的收获！
    决心
    只要我们有了决心，
    我们能把荒山搬掉；
    在万年的岩层下面，
    能把“龙王”捉到。
    题防风林
    我们要搭起天梯，
    和风砂展开大战。
    什么是天梯？那就是——
    丛林和翠绿的树枝。
    荒滩和苹果树
    在这块荒滩上面，
    不要说没有珍宝；
    几年前栽的苹果树，
    不是比珍宝还要好？
    荒滩栽上金子树，
    树枝上飞起金鸟。
    王老汉
    ——赠南水泉农业社的一位社员
    王老汉的一双手，
    几条裂痕像山沟，
    他照常挖着大渠，
    手不停地挥着土。
    他还是从早到晚，
    满脸笑容不发愁。
    传说愚公能移山，
    他比愚公更能干。
    他是一个独身汉，
    果园和他结了伴。
    他给人们栽下多少果树，
    自己吃的果子才几颗。
    乐园
    我看人间的乐园，
    就在社员的身旁，
    只要锄头一敲响，
    园门就对我们开放。
    向日葵摇着金杯，
    红海棠能制果浆。
    人们，把金杯举起吧，
    建设地上的天堂，
    无题
    一、水有路，土有家，
    石头就要大搬家。
    思想上开了门，
    困难见到咱们怕。
    二、
    眼看东风压倒西风，
    定叫今年胜过去年；
    党给我们一枝金箭，
    它一定要射穿荒原。
    给射手
    你要寻获一只牡鹿，
    要不怕走艰险的路；
    在最高的山巅之上，
    牡鹿主才回一下头。
    在田间
    在田间还积着冰雪，
    布谷鸟还没有啼叫，
    第一批敲响山谷的人，
    就能够把布谷鸟找到。
    他们也在唱着布谷，
    他们就是那布谷鸟！
    1958年2月，写于南水泉
