Xinhua News Agency, London, Feb. 23rd - According to TASS, William Gallacher, Honorary Chairman of the British Communist Party, published an open letter to Major General Moore, Commander of the US Forces in Britain, in the "Daily Worker" on the 22nd. In the letter, he pointed out that the majority of the British people oppose the continued presence of US troops in Britain.

Gallacher said: "Dulles and the war-minded US imperialists he represents are attempting to turn Britain into the front line of a new dangerous war, and they are constantly trying to provoke this new war." Gallacher exposed the lie that US bases are necessary for Britain's defense against "Soviet aggression." He pointed out that, on the contrary, the presence of US troops in Britain is a threat to Britain. He demanded that the US troops return home as soon as possible.

    加拉赫发表公开信
    要美军撤出英国
    新华社23日讯  据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党名誉主席威廉·加拉赫22日在“工人日报”上发表了一封致驻英美军司令穆尔少将的公开信。他在信中指出，大多数英国人民反对美国军队留驻英国。
    加拉赫说：“杜勒斯和他所代表的满脑袋战争思想的美帝国主义者企图把英国变成新的危险战争的最前线的目标，而且他们时刻企图挑起这个新战争。”加拉赫揭穿所谓美国基地是英国防卫“苏联侵略”所必需的这种谰言。他指出，恰恰相反，美军驻扎在英国是对英国的威胁。他要求美军及早回国。
