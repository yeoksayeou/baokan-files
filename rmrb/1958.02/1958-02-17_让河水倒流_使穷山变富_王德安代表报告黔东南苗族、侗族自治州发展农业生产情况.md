After rectification and criticism of local nationalism in the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, the masses have become even more enthusiastic about socialism. They say that anything beneficial to socialism should be undertaken, and anything beneficial to socialism should be utilized. In the past, when constructing water conservancy projects, if it was necessary to change the river course, the masses were afraid of damaging the "dragon vein" and would not allow it. This year, in order to build water conservancy projects, the masses are no longer afraid of disturbing the "dragon vein." They say, "Even the dragon vein must serve socialism."

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I will resolutely implement them.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on the agricultural production situation in the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture.

Tens of thousands of people throughout the prefecture are marching towards nature. This year, the original plan was to increase the irrigated area by 600,000 mu, but 700,000 mu were completed in less than three months, and now we are moving towards the goal of 1 million mu. The plan is to basically realize water conservancy this year.

Like the people of the whole country, the people of all ethnic groups in our Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture have an unprecedentedly high revolutionary spirit. On the Miao Mountains, along the Qingshui River, and on the banks of the Duliu River, one can see moving scenes of intense activity everywhere. Since November of last year, we have mobilized tens of thousands of people throughout the prefecture to march towards nature. Some are building reservoirs and opening canals, some are building pigsties and collecting manure, and some are weeding and fertilizing wheat and rapeseed fields. A vigorous labor competition centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation has been launched throughout the countryside. Women of all ethnic groups are working in the mountains just like men, and even elementary school students have organized shock brigades to carry out fertilizer accumulation and grass cutting competitions. Almost every household in the countryside has been swept into this production upsurge, and no idle people can be seen anymore. In the past, when the slack season came in winter, many young men and women of ethnic minorities would "shake the Malangs" and "sing the gate tower songs" (singing love songs and looking for partners in the evening). This year, in the high tide, there are very few "shaking the Malangs" and "singing the gate tower songs," and the young people are busy working on water conservancy projects. In our autonomous prefecture, it is the first time in history to mobilize so many people and work deep into the night with lanterns and torches to rush to build water conservancy projects. In Tianzhu County alone, more than 40,000 night shifts were completed in ten days. The people of all ethnic groups are eagerly hoping that our backward mountainous area will soon have a new great leap forward in production. In the high tide, any miracle can be created. The original plan for the whole prefecture was to expand the irrigated area by 600,000 mu this year, double the increase compared to last year. As a result, 700,000 mu were completed in less than three months, greatly exceeding the original plan. Recently, we have revised the plan again, raising it from 600,000 mu to 1 million mu.

In order to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production, this year we plan to raise 1.8 million pigs, apply 6,000 catties of fertilizer per mu, increase the area of multiple cropping, and improve the soil. The plan is to achieve the target of 800 catties per mu five years ahead of schedule.

Our motherland is making a great leap forward everywhere, and our economically and culturally backward minority areas must also advance at a faster pace, boost our energy, and strive for the upstream. We must speed up the increase in grain production. This year, the total grain output of the prefecture is guaranteed to increase by 18 percent compared to last year, on the basis of continuous increases in previous years. We must speed up the implementation of the National Agricultural Development Program, and the entire prefecture guarantees to achieve the goal of 800 catties per mu five years ahead of schedule.

In order to ensure the great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the prefecture, we have repeatedly studied the measures to increase production.

We must actively build water conservancy projects. This year, by repairing ditches, digging ponds, building dams, and diverting water to the mountains, we will expand the irrigated area by 1 million mu and strive to basically achieve water conservancy. We must vigorously accumulate fertilizer and ensure that pigs have pens, cattle have stables, people have toilets, and communes and households accumulate fertilizer. This year, we plan to raise 1.88 million pigs, an average of more than four per household, more than double the number of last year. This year, we require 6,000 catties of fertilizer to be applied per mu. In 1962, the plan is to raise 3 million pigs in the prefecture, increasing fertilizer application to 10,000 catties per mu. The multiple cropping area will be increased from 37 percent in 1957 to 51 percent this year; in 1962, it will reach 100 percent, and all cultivated land will be used for two or more crops. We must actively carry out the "four transformations" of transforming dry land into paddy fields, lean land into fertile land, sloping land into terraced fields, and terracing and improving the soil. The transformations will be basically completed within three years. In order to achieve increased production, we must also vigorously carry out technical reforms and promote various effective advanced experiences.

We know that to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production in our ethnic minority areas, where the foundation of our work is relatively weak, we will encounter many difficulties, but we are fully confident in overcoming all difficulties and completing the plan.

In the years since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and Chairman Mao, the 1.9 million people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture completed the land reform. In 1956, we also achieved agricultural cooperation, and now more than 97 percent of farmers have joined cooperatives. The two years of cooperation have brought consecutive bumper harvests. Grain production increased by 10 percent in 1956 compared to 1955, and by 11 percent in 1957 compared to 1956. Due to the annual increase in production since liberation, especially the great leap forward in production in the two years of cooperation, the average grain output per agricultural population in the prefecture has increased from 462 catties in 1950 to 798 catties in 1957. This shows the unparalleled superiority of the cooperative system and lays a solid foundation for the firm confidence of the people of all ethnic groups in taking the socialist road. In particular, after last year's rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the idea of local nationalism was criticized in our ethnic minorities, and a great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism was launched in the countryside. The people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are even more enthusiastic about socialism. They say that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have called on us to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer. Our ethnic minorities can no longer be slow, we must speed up and catch up. Anything that is beneficial to socialism should be done more, faster, better, and more economically, and anything that is beneficial to socialism should be fully utilized. For example, in the past, when constructing water conservancy projects, if we wanted to change the river course, the masses were afraid of damaging the "dragon vein" and would not allow it. This year, for the sake of a great leap forward in production, large-scale water conservancy projects were built to divert water to the mountains, and the masses were no longer afraid of damaging the "dragon vein." They said, "Even the dragon vein must serve socialism." Not only did they not object, but they also actively participated in water conservancy construction.

Our ethnic minority cadres must continue to work hard, study diligently, make themselves communist, overcome right-leaning thoughts, and be determined to be promoters. At present, a large number of cadres have already gone up the mountains and down to the countryside with hoes and sickles, and have joined the production upsurge, eating, living, and working with the masses. This year, all cadres in the prefecture who are in charge of agricultural work must cultivate experimental plots. Each level must have key points (the prefecture has key counties, the counties have key districts, the districts have key townships, the townships have key cooperatives, and the cooperatives have key teams), and implement the method of promoting at each level and contracting by area. Summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner. The cadres are determined to stand at the forefront of the high tide and actively lead and promote the new high tide of agricultural production.

As long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, strengthen unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of all ethnic groups, and humbly learn from the experiences of advanced regions, we will surely be able to make the rivers flow backwards and turn the poor mountains into rich ones; we will surely be able to achieve the task of 800 catties per mu five years ahead of schedule.

Please criticize and correct any inappropriate points in the above speech.

    让河水倒流  使穷山变富
    王德安代表报告黔东南苗族、侗族自治州发展农业生产情况
    黔东南苗族、侗族自治州经过整风和批判了地方民族主义以后，群众奔社会主义的劲头更足了。他们说，凡是对社会主义有利的事，都要兴办起来，凡是对社会主义有利的东西，都要利用起来。过去修水利，要改河道，群众怕坏了龙脉，不让改。今年要兴水利，群众不再怕动龙脉了。他们说：“就是龙脉也要它为社会主义服务”。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    现在，我就黔东南苗族、侗族自治州的农业生产情况发表一些意见。
    全州出动几十万人向大自然进军。今年原订增加灌溉面积六十万亩，不到三个月就完成了七十万亩，现在正向一百万亩的目标迈进，今年计划基本上实现水利化。
    我们黔东南苗族、侗族自治州的各族人民和全国人民一样，革命干劲空前高涨，苗岭山上，清水江旁，都柳江边，到处都可以看到热火朝天的动人景象。从去年十一月份开始，我们全州出动了几十万人向大自然进军。有的修水库、开渠道，有的搭圈棚、挖肥泥，有的在小麦、油菜地里薅草上肥。整个农村普遍展开了轰轰烈烈的以兴修水利和积肥为中心的劳动竞赛。各族妇女都和男人一样上山干活，就连小学生们也组织了突击队，开展积肥割草竞赛。农村里差不多家家户户都卷入了这个生产高潮，再也看不到闲人了。少数民族青年男女，往年一到冬天农闲的时候，“摇马郎”“唱门楼歌”的很多（在晚上彼此唱情歌、找对象）。今年在高潮里，“摇马郎”“唱门楼歌”的很少了，青年们都在水利工地上忙着干活。在我们自治州，像今年这样出动这末多的人，深更半夜、灯笼火把的在山上赶修水利。还是破天荒第一次，光是天柱县一个县，十天功夫就做了四万多个夜工。各族人民都巴不得我们这个落后的山区，在生产上很快来一个新的大跃进。在高潮里，什么奇迹都可以创造出来。全州原计划今年修水利扩大灌溉面积六十万亩，比去年提高一倍。结果，不到三个月，就完成了七十万亩，大大超过了原订计划。最近我们又修订了计划，从六十万亩提高到一百万亩。
    为了农业生产大跃进，今年计划养猪一百八十万头，每亩施肥六千斤，增加复种面积，进行土壤改良。计划提前五年实现亩产八百斤的指标。
    我们祖国到处都在大跃进，我们经济文化落后的少数民族地区更得跑步前进，更得鼓足干劲，力争上游。我们要加快速度提高粮食产量，今年全州粮食总产量保证在过去连年增产的基础上比去年增长百分之十八。我们要加快速度，实现全国农业发展纲要，全州保证提前五年达到亩产八百斤的奋斗目标。
    为了使全州的农业生产大跃进有可靠的保证，我们反复研究了增产措施。
    我们要积极兴修水利，今年通过修沟、挖塘、筑坝、引水上山，要扩大灌溉面积一百万亩，争取基本上实现水利化。大力增积肥料，做到猪有圈、牛有厩、人有厕所，社社积肥，户户积肥。今年计划养猪一百八十八万头，平均每户四头多，比去年提高一倍以上。今年要求每亩施肥六千斤。一九六二年计划全州养猪三百万头，每亩施肥提高到一万斤。复种面积今年将从一九五七年的百分之三十七提高到百分之五十一；一九六二年将达到百分之百，全部耕地都实现种二季或是多季。我们要积极进行旱地改水田、瘦田改肥田、坡土改梯田、梯土和改良土壤的四改工作。三年内基本上改完。为了实现增产，我们还要大力进行技术改革，推广各种行之有效的先进经验。
    我们知道，在我们工作基础比较薄弱的少数民族地区，要实现农业生产大跃进，会遇到很多困难，但是我们完全有信心战胜一切困难，完成计划。
    解放几年来，在党中央、国务院和毛主席的英明领导下，我们全州一百九十万各族人民完成土地改革之后，一九五六年又实现了农业合作化，现在已经有百分之九十七以上的农户参加了合作社。合作化两年来又是连年丰收，粮食产量一九五六年比一九五五年提高了百分之十，一九五七年又比一九五六年提高了百分之十一。由于解放以来年年增产，特别是合作化两年来的生产大跃进，全州按农业人口平均的粮食产量，已经从一九五○年的四百六十二斤提高到一九五七年的七百九十八斤。显示了合作化制度的无比优越，奠定了各族人民走社会主义道路的坚强信心。特别是经过去年的整风和反右派斗争，在我们少数民族中批判了地方民族主义思想，在农村中开展了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，全州各族人民奔社会主义的劲头更足了。他们说，党中央和毛主席号召我们要在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，我们少数民族不能再慢吞吞的了，一定要快马加鞭，迎头赶上去。凡是对社会主义有利的事，都要又多、又快、又好、又省的办起来，凡是对社会主义有利的东西，都要充分利用起来。比如过去修水利，我们要改河道，群众怕动坏了“龙脉”，不让改；今年为了生产大跃进，大兴水利，要引水上山，群众再也不怕动坏“龙脉”了。他们说“就是龙脉也要它为社会主义服务”。不但不反对，还积极参加修水利。
    我们少数民族干部要继续努力，刻苦学习，使自己共产主义化，克服右倾思想，立志做个促进派。目前，大批干部已经带着锄头镰刀，上山下乡，投入了生产高潮，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。全州领导农业工作的干部，今年人人都要稿试验田。层层都要有重点（州有重点县、县有重点区、区有重点乡、乡有重点社、社有重点队），实行层层推动、分片包干的办法。及时总结推广先进经验。干部们都决心站在高潮的最前线，积极领导和促进农业生产新高潮。
    只要我们紧紧依靠党的领导，加强各民族的团结互助，充分发挥各族人民的积极性和创造性，虚心学习先进地区的经验，我们就一定能够让河水倒流，使穷山变富；我们就一定能够提前五年实现亩产八百斤的任务。
    以上发言不当之处，请予批评指示。
