Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th February. Five thousand cadres, dispatched to over one hundred mountain areas in Jiangxi Province, have made a heroic pledge with a spirit that moves mountains and rivers: to transform the face of Jiangxi's mountainous areas within three years. Their slogan is: "Work hard for three years to afforest all barren mountains, reclaim all neglected oil-tea forests and tea plantations, manage all mountain forests through the guidance of agricultural cooperatives, nurture and protect all forests well (including eliminating fires and preventing forest pests and diseases), develop mountain resources, and bring a new look to transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in mountainous areas."

This inspiring goal was put forward by representatives of the land reclamation farms, representing the 50,000 dispatched cadres, at the recent conference of land reclamation farm directors held in Nanchang by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed the task of a comprehensive great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production to the workers and peasants of the province some time ago, it aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the cadres going up the mountains, and they put forward the need to achieve a great leap forward in mountain production. The directors of the land reclamation farms, carrying the will and determination of the dispatched cadres, jointly formulated a plan for a great leap forward in the mountainous areas at the meeting.

In the process of discussing and formulating this leap forward plan, the responsible cadres of the farms analyzed the favorable conditions for the great leap forward at the meeting, and unanimously believed that it was entirely possible to change the face of the mountainous areas in three years. These conditions are: First, all the cadres going up the mountains have been inspired with full revolutionary enthusiasm; second, there is strong support from the vast mountainous areas and the people of the whole province; and third, the resources of the mountainous areas are extremely rich. Based on these conditions, each farm put forward specific plans and measures for changing the face of the mountainous areas in three years. Ma Tingshi, the director of the Jinggangshan Land Reclamation Farm and a veteran of the Long March, said that within three years, they would reclaim all 15,000 mu of barren mountains suitable for afforestation and 900 mu of neglected oil-tea forests, and reclaim 30,000 mu of wasteland to plant tung trees and crops. In order to develop and utilize the rich resources of Jinggangshan, they will dredge two rivers, each dozens of li long, in the next two years to transport a large amount of firewood. In addition, they will build a paper mill to produce 50,000 tons of paper from bamboo every year. This veteran Red Army soldier said with full confidence that they would completely change the face of Jinggangshan in just two years, not three. Cao Jingyi, the director of the Damaoshan Land Reclamation Farm, said at the meeting that they had full enthusiasm and were determined to struggle for three years to turn Damaoshan into a prosperous mountain city. In addition to large-scale afforestation, forest cultivation, and the development of economic forests, they will also build factories for papermaking, rosin, fiber, brewing, sawing, and oil extraction, depending on the resource situation.

Each farm has also formulated longer-term plans. During the second five-year plan period, these more than one hundred land reclamation farms will be divided into districts and be responsible for developing one thousand forestry bases, with the operating area expanding from 4 million mu this year to 25 million to 30 million mu. Through these socialist forestry bases, the mountain forests of the province will be managed, and this will be used to strive to complete the ten-year greening task in five years.

Each land reclamation farm has made a plan for this year's great leap forward. According to statistics, one hundred land reclamation farms will reclaim 70,000 mu of wasteland and afforest and cultivate 500,000 mu of forests this year.

At this meeting, the heads of agriculture, forestry, industry, transportation, supply and marketing, banking, and other departments all expressed their willingness to do their best to support the land reclamation farms in achieving the great leap forward plan. The industrial departments guaranteed to support the construction of small-scale industries in various mountainous areas with the necessary manpower, materials, and financial resources. The shipping and transportation departments proposed to help the land reclamation farms dredge all the rivers within three years so that they can all transport firewood and bamboo.

    江西五万下放干部发出英雄誓言
    决心苦干三年改变全省山区面貌
    新华社南昌8日电　江西省下放在一百多个山头的五万名干部以气吞山河的英雄气概，决心在三年内改变江西山区的面貌。他们的口号是：苦干三年，在三年内把全部荒山绿化，把荒芜的油茶林、茶叶山全部垦复，通过指导农业社把全部山林经营和管理起来，把所有的森林抚育和保护好（包括消灭火灾、防治森林病虫害），把山地资源开发出来，并且使山区的交通运输、文教卫生事业都出现新的面貌。
    这个令人鼓舞的目标，是各垦植场场长代表五万名下放干部，在中共江西省委最近在南昌召开的垦植场场长会议上提出的。中共江西省委在前些日子向全省工人和农民提出工农业生产全面大跃进的任务后，激起了上山干部的革命干劲，他们纷纷提出要实现山区生产大跃进。各垦植场场长带着下放干部的意志和决心，在集会上共同制定出山区大跃进的计划。
    在讨论制定这个跃进计划的过程中，各场负责干部在会上分析了大跃进有利条件，一致认为三年改变山区面貌是完全可能的。这些条件就是：一、全体上山干部已鼓起了十足的革命干劲；二、有广大山区和全省人民的大力支援；三、山区资源极其富饶。根据这些条件，各场提出了三年改变山区面貌的具体规划和措施。井冈山垦植场场长、长征老战士马庭士说，他们要在三年内把所有能造林的一万五千亩荒山，九百亩荒芜的油茶林全部垦复，并开垦三万亩荒地，种上油桐树和农作物。为了开发和利用井冈山的丰富资源，他们在今明两年内，将疏浚两条长数十华里的河道，大量运出木柴，此外还要建设一个造纸厂，每年利用毛竹造纸五万吨。这位老红军战士信心百倍地说，他们用不了三年，两年后就要使井冈山的面貌完全改观。大毛山垦植场场长曹镜沂在会上表示：他们有十足的干劲，坚决奋斗三年，把大毛山变成经济繁荣的山城。他们除了大面积造林、育林和发展经济林以外，还要根据资源情况，兴建起造纸、松香、纤维、酿酒、锯木、榨油等工厂。
    各场还制订了较长远的规划。在第二个五年计划期间，这一百多个垦植场将划区分工负责，发展一千个林业基地，经营面积将从今年的四百万亩扩大到二千五百万至三千万亩。通过这些社会主义林业基地，把全省的山林管理起来，并以此争取五年完成十年绿化的任务。
    各垦植场都作出了今年的大跃进计划。据统计，一百个垦植场今年将开垦荒地七万亩，造林育林五十万亩。
    在这次会议上，农业、林业、工业、交通、供销、银行等各部门的负责人都表示尽力支援各垦植场实现大跃进计划。工业部门保证支援各山头兴建小型工业所需要的人力、物力和财力。航运交通部门提出三年内帮助各垦植场疏浚所有的河道，达到都能运出木柴和毛竹。
