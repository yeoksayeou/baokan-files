Accompanying Notes on Premier Zhou's Visit to North Korea
By our reporters Yu Minsheng and Wang Yuzhang

After a seven-day visit to North Korea, Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government delegation he led have returned home, bidding farewell to the heroic country and its peace-loving people. However, the profound friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people, and their diligence and perseverance in socialist construction, will forever be remembered by the friendship envoys of 600 million people.

During these days, despite the freezing temperatures and swirling snow in North Korea, the delegation felt the warmth of the socialist family at every moment.

As Premier Kim Il-sung said, the Korean people celebrated the visit of the Chinese government delegation to North Korea as a festival. In the days leading up to the delegation's arrival in Pyongyang, the entire city was in a state of jubilation. People were wholeheartedly doing everything related to welcoming the delegation, expressing their love and respect for the envoys of the Chinese people.

At 1:00 PM on February 14th, the silver-white plane carrying the delegation landed at Pyongyang Airport amidst the cheers of the crowd and the waving of red flags. After receiving a grand welcome at the airport, Premier Zhou Enlai, alongside Premier Kim Il-sung, rode in an open-top car from the airport to the center of Pyongyang. Along the way, welcoming crowds thronged both sides of the ten-li-long road, erupting in waves of thunderous cheers. The flowers and colorful flags they waved formed layers of colorful waves. Pedestrians stopped, and residents from the alleys poured into the streets to join the welcoming procession. Premier Zhou Enlai waved to the crowds while continuously accepting bouquets of flowers offered by children, women, and the elderly. By the time he arrived at the delegation's residence, the car was almost overflowing with flowers.

Just as in Pyongyang, whether in the snowy city of Hamhung or the heroic port of Wonsan, whether in densely populated cities or in the vast countryside, scenes of seas of flowers and forests of flags appeared everywhere.

Indeed, the Korean people's friendship towards the Chinese people is inexhaustible. Here are the stories of two Korean elderly mothers welcoming Chinese guests:

When Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Hwanghae Iron Works, an elderly Korean woman walked up to him tremblingly, took his hand, and presented him with a pair of silver chopsticks and a silver bowl wrapped in red silk. Premier Kim Il-sung introduced her to Premier Zhou Enlai, saying, "She is a good mother to the Chinese People's Volunteers." The elderly woman, with gratitude, said to Premier Zhou Enlai, "It was the Chinese People's Volunteers who helped us defeat the American bandits and protect the safety of the Korean people. They are our benefactors!" Premier Zhou Enlai said, "We fought together to defeat American imperialism, protect Korea, and also protect China, while also safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world." Premier Zhou Enlai gladly accepted her gifts and took a photo with her.

Korean friends told many stories about this elderly woman. Her name was Ryu Mae, and she lived near the 38th parallel. Once, a Chinese People's Volunteer soldier's feet were frostbitten and he fell behind. Mother Ryu took him to her home to treat him. She preferred to wear single-layer trousers and suffer from the cold herself, using her own padded trousers to wrap the soldier's feet. Under her motherly care, the soldier quickly recovered and returned to his unit. Another time, the Volunteers were about to set out for battle, but they lacked rations. Mother Ryu cooked her only pint of millet and sent it to the Volunteers. As for washing clothes, cooking meals, and caring for the sick Volunteers, she considered these things extremely ordinary. Therefore, the Volunteer soldiers called her "Good Mother of the Volunteers."

This time, Mother Ryu heard that Premier Zhou Enlai was coming to visit the Hwanghae Iron Works, and she happily traveled hundreds of miles from her hometown to meet him with the gifts she had prepared.

Another elderly woman, Choi Sa-ryeol, was a member of the Sangyang Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County, near Pyongyang. When Premier Zhou visited the agricultural cooperative, she warmly held his hand and quickly expressed her heartfelt words: "I will never forget the Volunteers! They saved my old life!" Tears welled up in Mother Choi's eyes.

Premier Zhou Enlai, while looking at Mother Choi, said kindly, "Our two peoples are as close as brothers. Helping the Korean people is our bounden duty." Mother Choi continued to recount her unfortunate experiences. Her only son and daughter-in-law were brutally murdered by the American army when they occupied this area. At that time, her son was the labor party branch secretary of this village. Later, the American army bombed their village and destroyed his house. Her three grandsons and granddaughters were all killed. She herself was buried in a pile of earth, and Volunteer soldiers rescued her from the fire.

Premier Zhou Enlai asked her with great concern, "Old lady, how old are you?"

Mother Choi replied excitedly, "Sixty-five years old. The Volunteers saved my life. To build a better life, I want to live longer and longer!" Premier Zhou Enlai blessed her: "You certainly can! You certainly can!"

The stories of these two ordinary Korean elderly mothers illustrate that the friendship between China and North Korea, forged in blood through long-term common struggle, has been firmly rooted in the hearts of every person and is connected to the flesh and blood of every ordinary person. Almost everyone here can tell a story of Sino-Korean friendship that they have personally experienced, bearing witness to the existence and development of this great friendship. This is why the Korean people warmly welcome Chinese guests.

On the second day after arriving in Pyongyang, Premier Zhou Enlai and others, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung, climbed to the highest point of Moranbong Hill—the Eulmil Terrace—to overlook the city of Pyongyang. They discussed the history of Pyongyang while slowly climbing the mountain. In the morning mist, the high-rise buildings rebuilt after the war were faintly visible, and the newly paved, wide, and flat avenues stretched far into the distance. Premier Zhou Enlai repeatedly praised the achievements of Pyongyang's reconstruction and its beautiful scenery.

If you had visited Pyongyang during the war, you would be even more amazed by the construction achievements made in Pyongyang in the four years since the end of the war. During the war, American planes dropped more than 50,000 bombs on Pyongyang, turning the entire city into ruins. Now, Pyongyang has restored and rebuilt more than 60 large and medium-sized factories with modern equipment, more than 80 schools, and entire streets of residential areas. Various public facilities—shops, hospitals, and cinemas—have been built. Pyongyang has not only restored its former appearance but has also become more beautiful, younger, and more magnificent.

After visiting the Hwanghae Iron Works, Premier Zhou Enlai praised the factory's recovery and reconstruction as "the most vivid symbol of the indomitable spirit of the heroic Korean people." This is indeed the case. The factory was bombed more than 80 times by American planes during the war, and 75% of its equipment was destroyed. Immediately after the armistice, the factory was filled with bomb craters, covered with weeds taller than a person, and scattered with broken iron.

However, as soon as the armistice was signed, the factory's workers cut down the weeds, built sheds to live in, and began restoration work. The rolling mill was restored, but the factory building had not yet been rebuilt, so production began in the open air. The workers struggled arduously for four years, and now they have restored three open-hearth furnaces and will produce 230,000 tons of steel and 100,000 tons of steel products this year. In addition, the factory has also built more than 40,000 square meters of housing and many cultural facilities during this period. This is the workers' loudest response to the destruction of American imperialism.

The Korean people's spirit of hard work, diligence, and bold innovation is also reflected in agricultural production. When Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Sangyang Agricultural Cooperative, he discovered on a chart that the cooperative had harvested more than 1,100 kilograms of cotton per chongbo in its first year of cotton planting last year, and they planned to increase this by more than two times this year compared to last year.

"What methods are you using to increase production?" Premier Zhou Enlai began an interesting conversation with the cotton production captain.

The production captain first handed Premier Zhou Enlai a fist-sized nutrient jar for planting cotton, and then replied, "We are using this type of nutrient jar to plant cotton. Last year's experience proved that this method can double production compared to ordinary planting methods. This year, we plan to use nutrient jars for all 73 chongbo of land for cotton planting."

After carefully examining the nutrient jar, Premier Zhou Enlai asked them what it was made of and how many were needed per chongbo of cotton.

The production captain answered the Premier's questions in detail. He said that the nutrient jar was made of 60% decomposed leaves, 30% cow manure, and 10% soil. Each chongbo requires 15,000 to 18,000, which means that they will need to make more than one million nutrient jars to plant 73 chongbo of cotton this year.

The problem is clear: this method of increasing production is effective, but it requires more, harder, and more skilled labor. The cotton production captain of this cooperative stated that they are fully confident and determined to complete their leap-forward production increase plan.

Premier Zhou Enlai praised their plan to increase cotton production and said, "We will come to learn from you when your plan is realized."

The production captain also gave a nutrient jar to Premier Zhou Enlai, who gladly accepted his gift.

As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out many times during his visit to North Korea, such a hardworking, brave, and fearless people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Kim Il-sung, will surely build the three thousand miles of beautiful mountains and rivers even more beautifully.

    周总理访问朝鲜随行记
    本报记者　于民生　王玉章
    周恩来总理和他率领的中国政府代表团在朝鲜访问了七天以后，告别了英雄的国度和爱好和平的人民已经回国去了。但是，朝鲜人民对中国人民的深厚友谊和他们在社会主义建设中表现出的勤劳和毅力，却使六亿人民的友谊使节永志不忘。
    这些天来，尽管朝鲜千里冰封、雪花飞舞，但是，代表团每时每刻都感到社会主义大家庭的温暖。
    正像金日成首相所说的，朝鲜人民是把中国政府代表团来朝鲜访问当做一个节日来庆祝的。在代表团到达平壤的前夕，平壤全城已经是一片欢腾的景象。人们尽心尽意地去做有关迎接代表团的每一件事情，表示他们对中国人民的使节的敬爱。
    2月14日下午一时，代表团乘坐的银白色飞机在万众欢腾声中，在红旗招展的平壤机场上着陆。周恩来总理在机场上接受了盛大的欢迎以后，同金日成首相并肩乘坐敞篷汽车由机场前往平壤市中心区。途中，十多里长的道路两旁云集着的欢迎群众发出此起彼伏的雷鸣般的欢呼声，他们手里挥舞着的鲜花和彩旗汇成了一层层的彩色波浪。路上行人停住了脚步，里巷里的居民涌到街上参加了欢迎的行列。周恩来总理一面挥手向群众致意，一面不停地接受着儿童、妇女和老人们献上的花束。当他到达代表团的寓所的时候，汽车里已经几乎堆满了花束。
    像在平壤一样，代表团无论是在雪花纷飞的咸兴，还是在英雄的港口元山，不管是在人口集中的城市，还是在辽阔的农村，到处都出现了鲜花似海、旗帜如林的场面。
    的确，朝鲜人民对中国人民的友情是罄竹难书的。这里记述的是两位朝鲜老妈妈欢迎中国客人的故事：
    当周恩来总理访问黄海制铁所的时候，一位朝鲜老妈妈颤巍巍地走上前来，拉着周总理的手，把用红绸包着的一双银筷和一个银碗献给了他。金日成首相向周恩来总理介绍说：“她是中国人民志愿军的好妈妈。”这位老大娘却怀着感激的心情对周总理说：“是中国人民志愿军帮助我们打败了美国强盗，保卫了朝鲜人民的安全，他们是我们的恩人！”周恩来总理说：“我们一起打败了美国帝国主义，保卫了朝鲜，也保卫了中国，同时还保卫了远东和世界的和平。”周恩来总理很高兴地接受了她的礼物，并且同她一起合影留念。
    朝鲜朋友们讲了许多关于这位老妈妈的故事。原来，这位老妈妈名叫柳梅，家住在三八线附近。有一次，一个志愿军战士的脚冻坏了，不能走路而掉了队。这位柳妈妈就把他领到自己家里为他医治，她宁愿自己穿着单裤受冻，而把自己的棉裤用来给这个战士包脚。这个战士在她慈母般的照料下很快地伤愈归队了。还有一次，志愿军要出发打仗，但是缺少口粮，柳妈妈就把自己仅有的一升粟子炒熟送给志愿军。至于为志愿军洗衣、烧饭、看护病员这些事情，在她说来是极其平常的事情。因此，志愿军战士们把她叫做“志愿军的好妈妈”。
    柳妈妈这次听说周恩来总理要来黄海制铁所访问，她就高高兴兴地带着准备好的礼物，不远百里从自己家乡赶到这里来会见周总理。
    另一位老妈妈是平壤近郊顺安郡上阳农业社的社员崔史烈老妈妈，当周总理访问这个农业社的时候，她用双手热情地握着周总理的手，急促地倾吐着内心的话语：“我永远忘不了志愿军，是他们救了我这条老命！”崔老妈妈的眼眶溢出了泪水。
    周总理一面注视着崔老妈妈，一面亲切地说：“我们两国人民亲如兄弟，帮助朝鲜人民是我们应尽的义务。”崔老妈妈接着诉说了她的不幸遭遇。原来，她仅有的一个儿子和儿媳在美军侵占这一带的时候，惨遭美军杀害了。那时候，她的儿子是这个村子劳动党的支部书记。后来，美军又轰炸他们的村庄，炸中了他的房屋。他的三个孙子和孙女儿都被炸死。她自己也被埋在土堆里，是志愿军的战士们冒着烈火把她抢救出来的。
    周总理十分关怀地问她：“老太太，你多大年纪了？”
    崔老妈妈激动地回答说：“六十五岁了，志愿军救活了我。为了建设更美好的生活，我要活得更长更长！”周恩来总理祝福她：“一定能够！一定能够！”
    这两位普通的朝鲜老妈妈的故事说明，在长期的共同斗争中以鲜血结成的中朝友谊，已牢牢地生根在每一个人的心上，和每一个普通人血肉相连。这里几乎每个人都能讲出一段亲身经历的朝中友谊故事，为这个伟大友谊的存在和发展作见证。这就是朝鲜人民所以热烈地欢迎中国客人的原因。
    在到达平壤的第二天，周恩来总理等就由金日成首相陪同登上牡丹峰的最高处——乙密台眺望平壤市容。他们一面交谈着平壤的历史，一面缓步登山。在晨雾中，战后新建起来的一座连一座的高楼大厦隐约可见，新铺的宽阔平坦大道一直伸延到远方。周恩来总理不停地赞美平壤重建的成就和它的美丽景色。
    如果你在战争时期到过平壤，你就更会为平壤在战后四年多来取得的建设成就所惊奇。战争当中美机向平壤投下了五万多枚炸弹，平壤全城成了一片废墟。现在平壤已经恢复新建了六十多个现代化设备的大、中型的工厂，八十多个学校，整条街整条街的住宅区。各种公共设施——商店、医院、影剧院都建设起来了。平壤，不仅恢复了从前的面貌，而且变得更加美丽、更加年青、更加雄伟了。
    周恩来总理参观了黄海制铁所后，赞美这个工厂的恢复和重建“是英雄的朝鲜人民不屈不挠的精神的最生动的象征”。的确是这样的。这个工厂在战时曾被美机轰炸了八十多次，设备被破坏了75％。刚停战时，工厂内满地是弹坑，到处长着一人多高的蒿草和横七竖八的破铁。
    但是，这个厂的职工们在刚一停战的时候就割下蒿草，搭起棚子住下来，开始了恢复工作，轧钢机恢复起来了，但厂房还没恢复，就在露天开始生产。工人们这样艰苦斗争了四年，现在已恢复了三座平炉，今年要生产二十三万吨钢，十万吨钢材。另外，这个工厂这一时期还建设了四万多平方公尺的住宅和许多文化设施。这就是职工们对美帝国主义破坏的最响亮的回答。
    朝鲜人民的艰苦勤劳、大胆革新的精神也同样表现在农业生产方面。周恩来总理在上阳农业社参观时，在一张图表上发现这个农业社去年第一年种植棉花就每町步收获了一千一百多公斤棉花，而且他们今年还要比去年增加两倍多。
    “你们用什么办法增产？”周总理同棉花生产队长开始了有趣的谈话。
    生产队长首先把一个拳头大的植棉用的营养坛送到周总理手中，然后回答说：“就是用这种营养坛来种植棉花，去年的经验证明，这种方法可以比普通种法增产一倍。今年准备在七十三町步的土地上全用营养坛来种植棉花”。
    周总理仔细地观看了营养坛后，就问他们营养坛是用什么做成的？每町步棉花需要多少个？
    生产队长详细地回答了总理的问题，他说，营养坛是用60％腐化树叶、30％牛粪和10％泥土作成的。每町步需要一万五千个到一万八千个，也就是说今年他们种七十三町步棉花就需要作一百多万个营养坛。
    问题很明显，这种增产的方法是有效的，但需要更多的更艰苦的更有技术的劳动。这个社的棉花生产队长表示，他们完全有信心有决心完成他们这个跃进式的增产计划。
    周恩来总理赞扬了他们增产棉花的计划，并说：“等你们的计划实现了我们再来学习。”
    生产队长并把一个营养坛送给了周总理，周总理很高兴地接受了他的礼物。
    如同周恩来总理在访问朝鲜期间多次指出的，这样勤劳勇敢和富有大无畏精神的人民，在以金日成为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，一定会把三千里美丽江山建设得更加美丽。
