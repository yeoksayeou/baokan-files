    Washington Teems with Bandits
    A recent issue of "U.S. News & World Report" wrote: Americans "feel increasingly unsafe walking on the streets near the Capitol, where national laws are made. There is a possibility of being robbed and beaten to death while taking a walk. American senators and representatives leave their offices every night in fear and trepidation." The magazine said: "One congressman gave each of his female staff members a police whistle to blow as a warning if they encounter danger." The magazine wrote that Washington police authorities say that five other American cities with Washington's population have more frequent and more serious crimes than Washington.
    The Washington "Star" wrote that in recent months, criminal cases in the United States have increased by 10%.

    华盛顿盗匪如毛
    最近一期“美国新闻与世界报道”写道：美国“老百姓在制订国家法律的国会附近大街上行走越来越感到危险。散步时有可能遭到抢劫和被打死。美国的参议员和众议员每天晚上都胆战心惊地离开自己的办公室。”这家杂志说：“一个国会议员给他的女职员每人一个警笛，以备在遇到危险时鸣笛报警”。杂志写道，华盛顿的警察当局说，有华盛顿这样多人口的其他五个美国城市，犯罪次数比华盛顿还多，而且性质更严重。
    华盛顿“明星报”写道，最近几个月美国的犯罪案件增加了10％。
