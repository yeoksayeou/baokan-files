Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: After more than four months of arduous struggle, farmers across the country have overfulfilled the annual farmland water conservancy plan by 79.6%. This year's plan called for an increase in irrigated area of 92.21 million mu, but according to statistics as of February 20, the various farmland water conservancy projects actually completed nationwide can increase the irrigated area by a total of over 165 million mu. The total irrigated area developed in the thousands of years before liberation was only 240 million mu.

During this period, farmers in various places also carried out tremendous work on soil and water conservation, low-lying area management, and improvement of existing irrigated areas, controlling soil erosion over an area of more than 62,000 square kilometers and managing low-lying areas of more than 100 million mu. During the same period, rural hydropower stations have also developed greatly.

The farmland water conservancy construction movement over the past four months has become increasingly heated, with larger and larger scales, and higher and higher morale among the farmers. The number of people participating in farmland water conservancy construction nationwide each day was 20 to 30 million in October, rising to 60 to 70 million in November, exceeding 80 million in December, and developing to about 100 million in January. Even during the Spring Festival, there were still thousands upon thousands of laborers persisting in construction on the work sites. Now, from the interior to the border regions, from agricultural areas to pastoral areas, from the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains to the banks of the Pearl River, from the mountains to the plains, from the hilly areas to the low-lying areas, the broad masses of farmers are still fighting against drought and flood disasters. Even in the coldest Heilongjiang Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, farmers are still braving the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius to persist in construction. Due to this selfless labor, the country is increasing the area of paddy fields and irrigated land by an average of one million mu per day.

In this upsurge of water conservancy construction movement, the most prominent feature is that the broad masses have created many effective and appropriate good experiences and methods according to local conditions. In plateau areas and mountainous areas such as Gansu, a large number of water conservancy projects such as diverting water up the mountains and drawing water up the plains have emerged; in provinces such as Hubei, Hebei, Yunnan, and Guizhou, a large number of water conservancy projects such as "long vines bearing melons" and connecting canals and reservoirs have emerged; the Manghe River basin in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, created the experience of unified planning and comprehensive management from one township and one commune to one county, one prefecture, or one small watershed. These experiences have been promoted in many places and have been creatively developed. In this way, not only is the utilization rate of water resources greatly improved, and the irrigated area expanded, enabling the plain areas to achieve water conservancy earlier, but also mountainous areas, hilly areas, arid areas, and low-lying areas can be water conservancy. In just a few months, Xushui County, Hebei Province, built more than 120 reservoirs and managed 27 hills, forming a water conservancy network with rivers connected to each other and reservoirs connected to each other throughout the county, achieving water conservancy. Wushan County, Gansu Province, which was originally a severely arid area, has undergone fundamental changes in its natural landscape due to the construction of the Dongliang Canal across mountains and ridges, and the construction of three winding mountain canals. Yuanyang County, Henan Province, is a low-lying saline-alkali area that has been plagued by disasters for many years, and is currently transforming saline-alkali land into rice paddies, preparing to achieve water conservancy throughout the county.

According to the new situation of the water conservancy construction movement, most areas across the country have re-revised their plans. By the end of January, Anhui Province had completed 1.9 billion cubic meters of work, exceeding the original plan of 800 million cubic meters by more than one time. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward a new plan to complete 2.4 billion cubic meters. Henan Province plans to basically achieve water conservancy this year. Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces are preparing to eliminate water and drought disasters within two years. Hubei Province requires that ordinary water and drought disasters be basically eliminated within three years.

According to responsible persons from relevant departments, how to manage the existing water conservancy projects well while building water conservancy, and achieve benefits in the current year, is an important task at present. In particular, since there has been little rain and snow in some areas since the beginning of winter, giving full play to the benefits of existing projects and preventing spring drought is an important measure to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

### 苦战四月全国水利计划超额完成  原计划增加灌溉面积九千多万亩现已增加到一亿六千多万亩

    苦战四月全国水利计划超额完成
    原计划增加灌溉面积九千多万亩现已增加到一亿六千多万亩
    据新华社22日讯　经过四个多月的苦战，全国农民已经超额79.6％完成了今年度兴修农田水利的计划。今年计划要求增加灌溉面积九千二百二十一万亩，但是截至2月20日的统计，全国实际完成的各项农田水利工程，总共可以增加灌溉面积一亿六千五百多万亩。而解放前几千年所发展的灌溉面积总数也不过两亿四千万亩。
    在这段时间内，各地农民对水土保持、洼地治理和改善现有灌溉面积也都进行了巨大的工作，共计已控制水土流失面积六万二千多平方公里，治理洼地面积一亿多亩。同期，农村水电站也有很大发展。
    四个多月来的农田水利建设运动是越搞越热，规模越来越大，农民的情绪越来越高。全国每天参加农田水利建设的人数，10月份是两三千万人，11月份上升为六七千万人，12月份超过了八千万人，1月份发展到一亿人左右。即使在春节期间，也还有千千万万的劳动大军在工地坚持施工。现在，从内地到边疆，从农业区到牧区，从天山南北到珠江两岸，从山区到平原，从丘陵区到洼地，广大农民仍然在和旱涝灾害进行斗争。即使在最寒冷的黑龙江省和内蒙古自治区，农民仍然冒着零下三十度严寒坚持施工。由于这种忘我的劳动，全国平均每天要增加一百万亩水田和水浇地。
    在这次水利建设运动高潮中，最突出的特点是广大群众创造了许多因地制宜、行之有效的好经验和好办法。在甘肃等高原地区和山区大量出现了引水上山、汲水上原等水利工程；在湖北、河北、云南、贵州等省又大量出现长藤结瓜、渠库相连等水利工程；河南新乡专区的漭河流域创造了由一乡一社发展到一个县一个专区或一个小流域的统一规划、综合治理的经验。这些经验已在很多地方推广，并且有了创造性的发展。这样，不仅大大地提高水利资源的利用率，扩大灌溉面积，使平原地区提早实现水利化，而且山区、丘陵区、干旱区、洼涝区也可以水利化。河北省徐水县在短短的几个月中，修建了一百二十多个水库，治理了二十七个山头，全县已经形成河河相通、库库相连的水利网，实现了水利化。甘肃省武山县原来是一个严重的干旱区，由于修建了跨山越岭的东梁渠，又修了三条盘山大渠，自然面貌已经发生根本变化。河南原阳县是一个长年受灾的盐碱低洼地区，目前正在变盐碱地为稻田，准备实现全县水利化。
    根据水利建设运动的新形势，全国大部分地区都已经重新修订了计划。安徽省到1月底就完成十九亿公方的工作量，超过原计划八亿公方一倍以上，中共安徽省委又提出了完成二十四亿公方的新的计划。河南省计划在今年就基本实现水利化。广东、江苏两省准备在两年内就消灭水旱灾害。湖北省要求在三年内基本消灭普通水旱灾害。
    据有关部门负责人谈，如何在兴修水利的同时，把现有水利工程管好，在当年就发挥效益，这是当前的一项重要工作。特别是由于入冬以来，部分地区雨雪稀少，发挥现有工程的效益，防止春旱，更是争取今年丰收的一项重要措施。
