    The Era of the Great Leap Forward
    Fang Lingru
    I am searching in my mind for all the vocabulary I have learned in my life, wanting to pick out the richest, most beautiful, and most magnificent adjectives to describe the historical beginning of our socialist Great Leap Forward era, to describe the heroic spirit of our people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with socialist consciousness and socialist drive, but I find it difficult. For example, like this: before liberation, our ancestors opened up 230 million mu of irrigated land in four thousand years, but now we have opened up 117 million mu in four months. The achievement of four months is equal to half of four thousand years. What kind of people can achieve such a leap, and what kind of life ideal has such great inspiring power? No matter whether you use "magnificent" or "surging" or all kinds of exciting adjectives, in the face of such epoch-making facts, they all limit my imagination. This is the beginning of a great epic!
    No matter how high the mountain is, there is a limit, and no matter how deep and wide the sea is, there is a bottom and an edge, but the wisdom of our people is immeasurable, and the potential of our people is also inestimable; in the past, these were all heavily pressed under heavy mountains, and today, how can they not burst out together? The people themselves also sing like this: "No matter how high the mountain is, it is not higher than my heel, and no matter how frozen the ground is, it won't freeze our fiery hearts." They use such a heroic spirit to declare war on nature. At the National People's Congress meeting, the representative of Hebei Province said: Ninghe County is close to the sea, and people watch the rolling river water flowing into the sea in vain, but for thousands of years, it has been a matter of course for rivers to return to the sea, who can change it? This time, the people of Ninghe County stood up all at once, thousands of people on this side of the river, and thousands of people on the other side of the river, relying on their hands to block the 38-meter-wide and 3-zhang-deep Jiyun River with grass bags. The first time they blocked half of it, it was washed away by the river, but they never bowed their heads and never retreated. People held a meeting and put forward a more resolute and louder slogan: "Don't go home until the river is blocked." In this way, they blocked the river together and took the water back from the sea.
    Taking the water back from the sea! Some people also say, taking back the villages and land buried by sand dunes for many years from the sand dunes. Some say: Hundreds of acres of sandy beaches become fertile fields, and vast cotton fields roll with snowballs; many Gobi deserts in the north and south of Tianshan Mountains have become verdant and vast fertile fields, and large-scale socialist farms and pastures have been built. These simple words bring me vivid pictures.
    People have conquered nature and built their own beautiful villages. There is a poem: "The day before yesterday at sunset, the river was in the west depression, this morning the rising sun rises, the river is in the east village, at noon the sun is due south, the canal water surrounds the village." I love this poem. As I read it, I also seem to see the gurgling water and hear the laughter of people's labor victory. Our people not only compete with mountains and rivers for land, but also race against time so easily. A canal 25 li long and 103,000 cubic meters of earthwork was completed in one night and a half day. Isn't this really like a fairy tale?
    Our working people are not afraid of any difficulties for the Great Leap Forward in production. They say: "Mountains and rivers can be changed, and the Great Leap Forward is not difficult." The plan for water conservancy construction by the people of Anhui Province has been set and broken through, and broken through again. In a short winter, more than 1.8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone were completed. Now the people of the whole province are working hard to complete 2.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork. In such soaring numbers, we seem to breathe the people's enthusiasm for socialist construction.
    After listening to all this, I have a general feeling—life. For thousands of years, people have wanted to have a life of their own liking, but they could not get it. Now that we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who have no other interests than the interests of the people, they have united thousands of people around them and used all their boiling energy and all their wisdom to strive for the victory of socialism. The Party's call to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, learn culture (create a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme to facilitate learning), run schools diligently and thriftily, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily, all show meticulous care for the people's lives and improve their living standards. Based on past experience, and after the victories of the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, the great blooming and contending, and the great debate, our working class and all working people have hearts as bright and hot as torches, believing that life without labor is impossible, and that only socialist labor is the source of a new and happy life. Therefore, some young girls would rather postpone their wedding dates in order to build canals. They said: "Marriage is a personal matter, and the canal construction project is related to the interests of the masses." In order to prevent employees from being absent from work, the family members of workers have established mutual aid groups. If one person is sick, more than a dozen people volunteer to give blood to the patient, saying, "As long as it is beneficial to socialism, we will do whatever it takes."
    In these days, I have had extremely many feelings. I feel even more that our motherland is so lovely, our people are so lovely, and our Party is the closest of relatives in our lives.

### 大跃进的时代

    大跃进的时代
    方令孺
    我正在心里搜索我一生所学得的词汇，想在里面挑出最丰富、最美丽、最壮阔的形容词，来形容我们社会主义大跃进的历史开端的时代，形容我们人民在党和毛主席的领导下，社会主义觉悟和社会主义的干劲的英雄气魄，但是我觉得很难找到。例如像这样的事：解放前我们的祖先四千年开辟了两亿三千万亩的灌溉面积，现在四个月开辟了一亿一千七百多万亩，四个月的成绩等于四千年的一半，这样的飞跃，是怎样的人民才能做到，是怎样的生活理想才有这样伟大鼓舞力量？无论你用“壮阔”也好，“澎湃”也好，种种激动人心的形容词，在这样开天辟地的事实面前，都限制了我的想像力。这是一个伟大的史诗的开端！
    山再高，也有个尺度，海再深再宽，也有个底，有个边，而我们的人民的智慧啊是无法测量，我们人民的潜力也无法估计；过去，这些都沉沉地压在重重高山底下，到了今天，它怎能不一齐迸发出来呢？人民自己也这样歌唱：“山再高也高不过我的脚跟，地再冻，冻不着我们火热的心。”他们就用这样豪迈的气魄与自然宣战。在全国人民代表大会会议上，河北省代表说：宁河县紧靠海边，人们眼看着滚滚的河水，白白的流进大海，可是千年万年河流归大海是天经地义，谁能变动？这一回宁河县人，却一下站起来，河这边几千人，河那边几千人，就凭双手用草袋闸住这三十八公尺宽、三丈深的蓟运河，第一次闸了一半就被河水冲垮了，可是绝不低头，绝不退却，人们开了会，提出一个更坚决、更响亮的口号“不闸住大河不回家”。就这样一齐闸住了河流，把水从大海那儿夺回来。
    把水从大海那儿夺回来！也有人说，把多年被沙丘埋没的村庄和土地从沙丘那儿夺回来。有的说：百亩沙滩变良田，茫茫棉海滚雪团；天山南北许多戈壁滩变成碧绿万顷的良田，建成了大型的社会主义的农场和牧场，这些朴素的语言，带给我一幅幅生动的图景。
    人们战胜了大自然，建设自己美丽的村庄，有一首诗：“前天夕阳下，河水在西洼，今晨旭日升，河水到东村，中午日正南，渠水绕村转。”我喜爱这首诗。我读着，同时也好像看到淙淙流水，听到人们劳动胜利的笑声。我们人民不但与大山大河争夺土地，与时间赛跑也显得如此轻松，一条长二十五华里，十万零三千土方的渠道，就在一夜零半天完成，这不真像是童话故事一样吗？
    我们劳动人民为了生产大跃进，任何困难都不怕。他们说：“山河都可改，跃进也不难”。安徽省人民兴修水利的计划，定好又突破，突破又突破，短短的一冬，完成土石方十八亿多公方，现在全省人民正在为完成二十四亿土方而奋斗。在这样飞跃的数目字中，我们好像呼吸到人民对于社会主义建设的热情。
    我听了这一切，得了一个总的感想——生活。几千年来，人民想望有自己愿意的自己喜欢的生活，而不可得。现在有了共产党毛主席，除了人民的利益之外没有其他利益，因此把千千万万人民团结在自己的周围，把全部沸腾的精力和所有的智慧用来争取社会主义胜利实现。党号召除四害、讲卫生、学文化（创造便于学习的汉语拼音方案），勤俭办学、勤俭办一切事业，都是无微不至的关怀人民的生活，提高生活水平。我们工人阶级和全体劳动人民根据以往的经验，又在整风、反右斗争胜利、大鸣大放、大辩大论之后，个个人的心都像火炷一样的明亮、炽热，相信生活而不劳动是不可能的，也只有社会主义劳动，才是获得新的、幸福生活的源泉。因此有些年青的姑娘为了修渠宁可延迟结婚的日期，她们说：“结婚是个人的私事，修渠工程是关系着群众的利益。”工人家属为了使职工不缺勤，成立了互助组，一人有病，十多人自愿为病人输血，说“只要对社会主义有利，叫我们怎么都行。”
    在这些日子里，我的感受多极了。我更觉得我们的祖国真可爱，我们的人民真可爱，我们的党更是我们生活中最亲的亲人。
