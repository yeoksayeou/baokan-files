Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. Academician Sisakyan, head of the International Scientific Liaison Committee of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about the development of cooperation between the Soviet Academy of Sciences and its vast scientific research institutions and scientists from People's Democratic countries. Academician Sisakyan said that the cooperation between scientists from socialist countries takes many forms: first, a wide exchange of books and materials between the Academies of Sciences of various countries and affiliated research institutes, libraries, and publishing houses; second, Soviet and People's Democratic countries' scholars invite each other to participate in various scientific conferences and lectures; third, mutual dispatch of students and graduate students; fourth, mutual dispatch of scholars to work regularly, familiarize themselves with the situation, achievements, or provide short-term assistance; fifth, scholars from two or more countries within the socialist camp use their common strength to study scientific problems or solve problems of common interest to some countries. From a scientific point of view, this kind of cooperation and connection is particularly important and will be further developed in the future.

The Soviet Academy of Sciences has signed cooperation agreements with the Academies of Sciences of China, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Romania, and other countries, and will soon sign an agreement with the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic. Scientific cooperation with Bulgaria, Albania, Mongolia, and Vietnam is included in the cultural agreements.

The Soviet Academy of Sciences exchanges millions of publications with the People's Democratic countries every year. In 1957, there were 225 graduate students and 70 advanced teachers from the People's Democratic countries studying at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, with the majority coming from China. More graduate students and advanced teachers will come to the Soviet Union this year.

Academician Sisakyan pointed out that the scientific research jointly conducted by scientists from socialist countries covers a wide range and has brought great results. For example, scholars from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and Romania have formulated a unified plan for jointly researching the Black Sea. This research work has yielded preliminary results. The joint survey and research of the Heilongjiang River basin by the Soviet and Chinese Academies of Sciences has been very effective, and the survey teams of the two Academies of Sciences have put forward a plan for comprehensive transformation and utilization of the Heilongjiang River basin. The first conference on the Heilongjiang River issue was held in Khabarovsk last fall, and the second conference will be held in Beijing soon. The four countries of the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Vietnam are also jointly studying fisheries in the western Pacific Ocean, and a special four-country representative conference was held in Moscow last year. Scientists from China and the Soviet Union have conducted two years of joint research on tropical plants in southern China, and the Soviet Union sent famous botanists to China. In addition, Soviet and North Korean scientists are jointly studying ginseng, Soviet and Polish scientists are jointly studying the geological structure of Poland, and Soviet and Czechoslovak scientists are jointly studying plant tissues. There are many other examples of this kind of special research, involving many important departments of science and technology.

Academician Sisakyan said that scientists from socialist countries are also writing scientific works with common efforts. For example, scientists from the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia are jointly writing a history of Mongolia. This work has been going on for two years, and two conferences have been held in Moscow and Ulaanbaatar. The third conference will be held in Beijing this year. Soviet economists are preparing to jointly write two works with economists from the People's Democratic countries: "The Emergence and Development of the World Socialist Economic System" and "The Socialist Industrialization of People's Democratic Countries." Geologists from China and the Soviet Union who participated in the Ussuri River expedition jointly drew geological and mineral distribution maps. Scientists from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries are preparing to write scientific works on Old Slavic languages.

Academician Sisakyan finally pointed out that in the cooperation of scientists from socialist countries, the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union occupies an important position. Last year, the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences signed a cooperation agreement stipulating that the scope of cooperation between the scientists of the two countries is very wide, and the two countries will jointly organize many expeditions and conduct many special studies together.

　　采取多种多样方式　共同进行科学研究
    苏联和兄弟国家科学家通力合作
    研究黑海和勘察黑龙江等工作获得成绩
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联科学院主席团国际科学联系委员会负责人西萨基扬院士，最近对新华社记者谈到了苏联科学院和它所属的庞大的科学研究机构同人民民主国家的科学家们合作的发展情况。西萨基扬院士说，社会主义各国的科学家们的合作采取了多种多样的形式：第一，各国科学院和所属研究所、图书馆、出版社之间广泛交换图书资料；第二，苏联和人民民主国家的学者相互邀请参加各种科学会议和讲学；第三，相互派遣留学生和研究生；第四，相互派遣学者作定期的工作，熟悉情况、成就，或进行短期的帮助；第五，社会主义阵营内两国或更多的国家的学者用共同的力量研究科学问题或解决一些国家有共同利益的问题，从科学观点来看，这种合作和联系特别重要，将来会得到进一步的发展。
    苏联科学院和中国、波兰、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜、罗马尼亚等国的科学院都签订了合作协定，不久将和民主德国科学院签订协定，和保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古、越南的科学合作则包括在文化协定里面。
    苏联科学院每年和人民民主国家交换数以百万计的出版物。1957年人民民主国家在苏联科学院学习的研究生有二百二十五人，进修教师有七十人，从中国来的占多数。今年还将有更多的研究生和进修教师到苏联来。
    西萨基扬院士指出，社会主义国家的科学家们共同进行的科学研究，涉及的范围很广，并且已带来了很大的效果。例如，苏联、保加利亚和罗马尼亚的学者制定出了对黑海进行共同研究的统一的计划。这种研究工作已获得初步的成果。苏联和中国科学院对黑龙江流域进行的共同勘察和研究收效很大，两国科学院的勘察队提出了综合改造利用黑龙江流域的方案。去年秋天在伯力召开了有关黑龙江问题的第一次会议，不久将在北京召开第二次会议。苏联、中国、朝鲜和越南四国也在共同研究太平洋西岸的渔业，去年在莫斯科召开了专门的四国代表会议。中国和苏联两国的科学家曾对中国南部的热带植物进行了两年的共同研究，苏联派遣了有名的植物学家到中国。此外，苏联和朝鲜的科学家正在共同研究人参，苏联和波兰的科学家正在共同研究波兰的地质构造。苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的科学家正在共同研究植物的组织。这种专题研究的例子还有很多，涉及科学技术的许多重要部门。
    西萨基扬院士说，社会主义国家的科学家还以共同的力量编写科学著作。例如，苏联、中国和蒙古三国科学家正在共同编写蒙古史，这一工作已进行了两年，在莫斯科和乌兰巴托召开过两次会议，第三次会议今年将在北京召开。苏联经济学家准备和人民民主国家的经济学家共同编写“世界社会主义经济体系的产生和发展”、“人民民主国家社会主义工业化问题”两部著作。参加乌苏里江考察队的中国和苏联的地质学家们共同绘制了地质和矿藏分布图。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚等国的科学家们准备编写古斯拉夫语文的科学著作。
    西萨基扬院士最后指出，在社会主义各国科学家们的合作中，中国和苏联两国的合作占有重要的地位。去年中国和苏联科学院签订了合作协定，规定两国的科学家们合作的范围非常广泛，两国将共同组织许多考察队，共同进行许多专题研究。
