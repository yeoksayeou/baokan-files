    Three Suggestions
    Joint Statement by Representatives Zhang Yi, Wu Yixiu, Qiu Ji, Yi Meihou, and Fang Junzhuang

    We fully agree with the four reports on the national budget, economic plan, language reform, and the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, regarding some issues discussed by the Overseas Chinese group, we put forward the following three suggestions.

    Incorporate the Production Increase Targets Stipulated in the Outline into the Annual Plan

    (1) Incorporate the production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft) into the national economic annual plan.

    After the promulgation of the draft National Agricultural Development Outline, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers has been greatly encouraged, creating a high tide of agricultural production nationwide. Now, more than 100 counties across the country have reached the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the outline ten years ahead of schedule. Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, and other provinces have also planned to reach the targets stipulated in the outline for ten years within five years or a little longer. Vice Premier Bo Yibo also stated in his report that, starting this year, more counties should reach the targets stipulated in the outline, and efforts should be made to fundamentally change the face of agricultural production in most parts of the country within three years. Furthermore, he requested that each province make a plan based on its own conditions as to how many counties within the province will reach the targets in this year, next year, and subsequent years. Obviously, a leap in agricultural production is about to occur on a large scale across the country. In this situation, the national economic authorities have the possibility of incorporating the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the outline into the national economic annual plan. We suggest that, if conditions permit, starting from next year, we begin to formulate this plan, stipulating how many counties and how much land nationwide will reach the targets stipulated in the outline within a year, and stipulating the average annual yield per mu of grain and cotton to be reached in each region designated by the outline as having grain yields of 400 jin, 500 jin, 800 jin, and cotton yields of 40 jin, 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin. Such a plan will become a plan for a great leap forward in agriculture nationwide, a fighting goal for farmers in various regions to strive to reach or even exceed in agricultural production that year, and therefore, it is of positive significance.

    Establish Large-Area Experimental Fields in Areas with the Highest Grain and Cotton Yields

    (2) Establish large-area high-yield crop experimental field areas, with a scope of several counties, one county, or several townships, in places with the highest yields of grain, cotton, etc., nationwide.

    Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, proposed: "Our method is to make comprehensive plans, strengthen leadership, boldly mobilize the masses, and go through experimentation in everything." The experience created by the CPC county committees of Hongan and Macheng counties in Hubei Province, where leading cadres personally engaged in experimental fields, has significant principled significance and is being promoted in rural work nationwide. Engaging in experimental fields is not only conducive to improving the style of work, gaining experience, and establishing models for leaders at all levels, but it will also inevitably promote a huge surge in agricultural production. If combined with the agricultural technology innovation movement, which will soon emerge with overwhelming force, establishing large-area experimental fields in high-yield grain and cotton areas, making advanced production increase targets even more advanced, will have a very positive promoting effect on the nation's farmers, who are greatly energized after the rectification campaign and determined to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced. The farmers in the Chaoshan area of Guangdong Province have excellent traditions in intensive cultivation, fine management, fertilization, and seed selection. In 1955, Chao'an and Chenghai counties became the first counties in the country to achieve grain yields of 1,000 jin. In 1957, the annual grain yield per mu in these two counties exceeded 1,200 jin, and it is estimated that they will exceed 1,400 jin and 1,600 jin respectively in 1958. The Shantou Prefecture has become the first prefecture in the country to reach the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Outline (Revised Draft), with a total of six counties in the prefecture becoming grain-yield-of-1,000-jin counties. We suggest that the central authorities consider whether to first select Chenghai and Chao'an counties, or add Jieyang, Puning, and Chaoyang counties, as a high-yield crop experimental field area focusing on rice. Relevant departments should work with Guangdong Province to formulate a plan, strengthen leadership, provide local farmers with appropriate support in terms of technology, materials (such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery), and other aspects, mobilize the masses, and jointly conduct experiments, so that this large-area high-yield grain area will see the emergence of "2,000-jin counties" in about three years, and further create higher records of unit area yield. According to representative Qu Mengjue, Chenghai County already has 2,000 mu of high-yield fields with an annual grain yield of 3,000 jin. With the support of the state, it is possible for this area to become the area with the highest unit area yield of grain in the world.

    Whether Macheng County in Hubei can be selected as a large-area cotton production experimental field area is a matter for relevant parties to study.

    Promote the Hanyu Pinyin Scheme and Implement Key Experiments

    (3) In promoting the Hanyu Pinyin scheme, implement key experiments and study whether the names of letters such as F, S... in the current letter table are the most suitable for beginners.

    The draft Hanyu Pinyin scheme submitted to this conference is indeed the most perfect scheme compared with previous Pinyin schemes. We recommend that the conference approve it. After this scheme is passed and promulgated, it will undoubtedly begin a new era in the history of the Chinese language reform movement. However, we have doubts about the fact that a small number of letters in the alphabet table are not named according to the easier-to-learn principles used in Latinized New Writing and Gwoyeu Romatzyh, but are named according to foreign languages. We believe that adopting Latin letters as the letters of the Hanyu Pinyin scheme is a major measure that is beneficial to international cultural exchange. However, this set of letters is used to spell authentic Chinese, so the names of the letters should be read in Chinese as much as possible. If the names of all the letters are read in Chinese, it will be easier for the vast number of beginners to learn and remember. If the names of the letters are all spelled out with a certain vowel, like Latinized New Writing and Esperanto, it will be more beneficial for beginners to learn the spelling method. In this way, the names of the letters will be more in line with the principles of nationalization, massification, and science, and will be easier to read, learn, remember, and spell. The names of the Latinized modern Vietnamese letters conform to this principle and facilitate learning for beginners. We believe that the Hanyu Pinyin scheme should implement the above principles to facilitate learning for 600 million people. We believe that if the consonant letters in the letter table of the Hanyu Pinyin scheme, except for the three letters J, Q, and X, are read as "ㄐㄧ, ㄑㄧ, ㄒㄧ" (instead of the more complicated ㄐㄧㄝ, ㄑㄧㄡ, ㄒㄧ), are all spelled with "ㄝ" or "ㄛ" (don't read F, L, and S as polysyllabic "ㄝㄈ," "ㄝㄌ," "ㄝㄙ" like in foreign languages; if it is necessary to clearly distinguish L and N, N, which is also used for nasal vowels, can be read as a double sound "ㄣ—ㄋㄝ"), and at the same time, R is read as the commonly used Chinese "ㄦ" (don't read it as "ㄚㄦ" in foreign languages; if it is necessary to indicate that R also serves as a consonant "ㄖ," it can also be read as a double sound "ㄦ—ㄖㄝ"), this would fully take care of Chinese habits and appropriately take care of international habits, and make the names of the letters closer to the pronunciation of the letters. It seems better. Such a reading method may be more convenient for the vast number of beginners (including the vast number of rural illiterates, semi-literates, and school-age children). Therefore, we suggest that in the early stage of promoting the Hanyu Pinyin scheme, relevant parties conduct key experiments in one or several primary schools, rural areas, factories, government agencies, and grassroots units of the army to determine whether the names of certain letters in the letter table should be slightly modified.

    We ask the relevant parties to consider and decide whether our opinions are appropriate and feasible.

专栏：

    三点建议
    张翼　吴益修　丘及  蚁美厚　方君壮  代表的联合发言
    我们完全同意关于国家预算、经济计划、文字改革和人大常委会工作的四个报告。现在就华侨小组讨论到的一些问题，提出下面三点建议。
    把纲要规定的增产指标纳入年度计划
    （一）把全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的增产指标，纳入国家经济年度计划。
    全国农业发展纲要草案公布以后，广大农民的生产热情受到了巨大的鼓舞，造成了全国农业生产的高潮。现在全国已有一百多个县，提前十年分别达到纲要所规定的粮食和棉花增产指标。广东、福建、浙江、江苏、山东、江西、河南、安徽等省并已规划在五年或者更多一点的时间内，粮食生产达到纲要规定要十年达到的指标。薄一波副总理在报告中也提出，从今年起，应当使更多的县达到纲要规定的指标，争取在三年内使全国大部分地区农业生产的面貌基本改观，并进一步要求各省根据自己的条件，做出一省范围内有多少个县在今年、明年和以后的年度内达到指标的规划。显然，农业生产的飞跃发展，即将在全国广大范围内出现。在这情况下，国家经济主管部门已有可能把纲要所规定的粮、棉增产指标纳入国家经济年度计划。我们建议如条件许可，从明年度起，开始制订这项计划，规定一年内全国有多少个县、多少田地达到纲要规定的指标，并规定纲要所划定的粮产四百斤、五百斤、八百斤和棉产四十斤、六十斤、八十斤、一百斤的各地区，粮食和棉花每亩年产量平均各要达到多少斤。这样的计划，将成为在全国范围内农业大跃进的计划，将成为各地农民当年在农业生产上争取达到以至超过的奋斗目标，因而是具有积极意义的。
    在粮棉产量最高地区建立大面积试验田
    （二）在全国粮食、棉花等产量最高的地方，建立以几个县、一个县或若干个乡为范围的大面积农作物高产试验田区。
    薄一波副总理的报告遵循党中央和毛主席的指示提出：“我们的方法是全面规划，加强领导，放手发动群众，一切经过试验。”湖北红安和麻城两县的中共县委所创造的领导干部亲自动手搞试验田的经验，具有重大的原则意义，正在全国农村工作中推广。搞试验田不仅有利于各级领导人员改进作风、取得经验、树立典范，并必然能够促进农业生产的巨大高涨。如果和不久即将以排山倒海之势涌现的农业技术革新运动结合起来，在粮、棉高产区建立大面积试验田，使先进的增产指标更为先进，对于整风后干劲大大提高、下决心比先进、学先进、赶先进的全国农民，将起十分积极的促进作用。广东省潮汕地区的农民，有精耕、细作、施肥、选种等优良传统。一九五五年潮安和澄海两县成为全国最初出现的粮食千斤县。这两个县一九五七年粮食每亩年产量都突破一千二百斤，预定一九五八年分别突破一千四百斤、一千六百斤。汕头专区已成为全国第一个达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定指标的专区，全专区共有六个县成为粮食千斤县。我们建议中央主管部门考虑是否可以首先选择澄海、潮安两个县，或加上揭阳、普宁、潮阳三个县，作为以水稻为主的农作物高产试验田区，由有关部门协同广东省制订规划，加强领导，在技术、物资（如化学肥料、农业机械）及其他方面给予当地农民以适当的支援，发动群众，共同进行试验，使这一大面积粮食高产区在三年左右的时间内，出现“两千斤县”，并进而创造更高的单位面积产量纪录。据区梦觉代表说：澄海县已有两千亩年产粮食三千斤的大面积丰产田。在国家的支援下，这一地区成为全世界粮食单位面积产量最高的地区，是有可能的。
    是否可以选择湖北的麻城县作为大面积棉产试验田区。这点请有关方面研究。
    推广汉语拼音方案实行重点试验
    （三）在推广汉语拼音方案中实行重点试验，研究现定字母表中F、S……等字母的名称，对于初学者是不是最合适的。
    这次提交大会的汉语拼音方案草案，同以前各种拼音方案比较，的确是最完善的一个方案。我们建议大会予以批准。这一方案通过颁行后，无疑将开始中国文字改革运动史的新纪元。但是，我们对于字母表上少数字母，不采用拉丁化新文字和国语罗马字所用的、比较易学的原则定名，而另按外语定名，抱有怀疑。我们认为，采用拉丁字母作为汉语拼音方案字母，就是有利于国际文化交流的重大措施。但这套字母是用来拼写道地汉语的，因此，字母名称应尽可能用汉语读出。字母的名称如全部都用汉语读出，就会更容易为广大初学者学会和记住。如果各声母字母的名称都同某一韵母拼读出来，像拉丁化新文字和世界语等那样，就会更有利于初学者学习拼法。这样，字母表的名称就更合民族化、大众化、科学化的原则，就更具有易读、易学、易记、易拼的优点。拉丁化的现代越南文字母名称，就是合乎这个原则而便利于初学者学习的。我们认为汉语拼音方案宜贯彻上述原则，以便利六亿人民学习。我们认为，如果汉语拼音方案字母表上的声母字母，除J、Q、X三个字母读“ㄐㄧ、ㄑㄧ、ㄒㄧ”（不读较复杂的ㄐㄧㄝ、ㄑㄧㄡ、ㄒㄧ）外，一律加“ㄝ”或“ㄛ”拼读（不要像外语那样把F、L、S读成复音的“ㄝㄈ”“ㄝㄌ”“ㄝㄙ”，如须明显区别L和N，可把兼用于鼻音韵母的N读成双音“ㄣ—ㄋㄝ”），同时，R则读为汉语常用的“ㄦ”（不读成外语中“ㄚㄦ”；如须表明R兼作声母“ㄖ”，也可读成双音“ㄦ—ㄖㄝ”），这样，既充分照顾了汉语习惯，也适当照顾了国际习惯，并使字母名称和字母的发音较接近。似较好些。这样的读法，对于广大的初学者（包括广大的农村文盲、半识字者和学龄儿童）可能是较为便利的。因此，我们建议在推广汉语拼音方案初期，由有关方面在一个或几个小学校、农村、工厂、机关、部队基层实行重点试验，以便决定字母表中某些字母的名称是否应稍加改动。
    我们的意见是否妥当可行，请有关方面考虑决定。
