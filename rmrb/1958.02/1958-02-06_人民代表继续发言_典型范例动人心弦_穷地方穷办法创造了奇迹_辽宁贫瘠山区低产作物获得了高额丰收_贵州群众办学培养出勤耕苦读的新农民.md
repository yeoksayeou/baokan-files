Xinhua News Agency, February 5th. The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary session for discussions at 3:00 PM today. The revolutionary spirit of striving for a great leap forward displayed by the masses of farmers in the water conservancy construction movement is still the focus of the representatives' speeches today. The old saying "Man can conquer nature" is fully demonstrated in the vivid examples of socialist construction created by the masses introduced by many representatives.

Forestry Minister Liang Xi made a speech at the beginning of the meeting on the national forestry construction situation during the first five-year plan and future work opinions. He said: Greening the motherland is a national cause, and afforestation mainly depends on the masses and cooperatives. He hopes that all agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and hilly areas with land and labor will strive to build "hundred-mu forests," "thousand-mu forests," and "ten-thousand-mu forests"; in plain areas, trees should be planted beside houses, villages, roads, and water, striving for each household to plant ten, one hundred, and one thousand trees.

　　Water is brought to a plateau forty feet high. The enthusiasm of the masses is like a split atom.

Zhao Shoushan, the representative and Governor of Shaanxi Province, introduced the enthusiasm of the people of Shaanxi Province in building water conservancy projects. He said that in the short three months of last winter, the area of irrigated land completed in the province was 300,000 mu more than the area built in the two thousand years of Shaanxi's history. The masses in Caojia Township, Qishan County, cut mountains and split rocks to dig canals, diverting river water to the "Wuzhangyuan" (Five-Zhang Plain), which is forty feet high, irrigating more than 5,000 mu of land. The masses in Lueyang, Ningqiang, and other places built "suspended weirs," "tunnel weirs," and "contour weirs," allowing rice paddies to climb the Qinling and Bashan Mountains. The masses proudly said: "Zhuge Liang once wanted to divert water to the Yuan (Wuzhangyuan) to solve the problem of drinking water for the soldiers, but he did not succeed; today, the Communist Party leads us, and we have actually achieved water on 'Wuzhangyuan' and 'rice paddies flying up the mountains'!" Zhao Shoushan said that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people is like an atom that has been split, playing an infinite and great role.

　　A raging fire burns away crawling thoughts. Barren mountains can make a great leap forward.

Li Yaoxian, an agricultural labor model from Liaoning Province, used extremely persuasive facts to boldly illustrate that the increase in production requirements of the agricultural development program can also be achieved in barren mountainous areas, and that a great leap forward can also be achieved in production. He said that the Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative in Gaozhang Township, Lingyuan County, where he is located, is a place with "many mountains, none of which are not bald; many rivers, none of which are not dry." From 1954 to 1957, the average grain yield per mu only increased from 180 jin to 215 jin, crawling like a tortoise. Some people think that "we are satisfied with what we have in this place where 'fuel, feed, and fertilizer are lacking, and five disasters (water, drought, insects, hail, and frost) are all present.' It is really adventurous and dreaming to want to produce 400 jin." However, based on the previous experience of increasing production in small plots, last year, the Chinese Communist Party organization of our cooperative decided to try it anyway, so it led the farmers to put efforts into 110 mu of sloping land to try planting millet, and it actually harvested an average of 780 jin per mu, more than three times that of other land. This shocked the entire community, and everyone came to see that it is really possible to "produce high yields on sloping land and high yields on low-yield crops." Li Yaoxian said that this increase in production turned into a raging fire in the entire community, severely burning away conservative and crawling thoughts. The enthusiasm of the members has soared, and they insist that all 15,000 mu of land in the community should produce grain like the 110 mu. Now this community has formulated a plan to achieve the agricultural development program's requirement of 400 jin of grain per mu eight years ahead of schedule in 1959, and wants to compete with the brother communities in the plains.

Representative Li Yaoxian said that 100% of the labor force in their community participated in farmland construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns last winter and this spring. For every barren mountain, the members are planting various trees to "put hats" on them; building terraces; to "tie waistbands" on them; building check dams at the foot of the mountains to "wrap feet" for the bald mountains. He excitedly said that in another three to five years, we can realize the dream that our ancestors have had for many years but could never achieve in the individual economy period: "All mountains are green, and all rivers are clear."

Li Minghao, the representative and Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, said that Hubei Province implemented the policy of "relying on the masses and managing water conservancy diligently and thriftily." Last winter and this spring, it will build 500 million cubic meters of large and small water conservancy projects, which is equivalent to twice the total number completed in the eight years from 1949 to 1957.

Li Youwen, the representative and Governor of Jilin Province, talked about how the farmers in Jilin Province, in the icy and snowy weather, with the momentum of overturning mountains and seas, broke through all obstacles of right-leaning conservative thoughts, carried out water conservancy construction, and marched towards nature. Li Youwen said that by mid-January, the various water conservancy projects that had been built in the province exceeded the original plan by 14.16%. In the hard struggle against the severe cold, the broad masses put forward ambitious slogans such as "not afraid of the wind, not afraid of the cold, finish the project before the New Year," "greedy for the dark, get up early, and follow the moon."

Huang Yan, the representative and Governor of Anhui Province, pointed out in a written statement that the achievements of the people of Anhui Province in building water conservancy projects last winter were equal to the past eight years. They want to strive to achieve the national agricultural development program in the next five to seven years and increase the province's grain output from 24 billion jin in 1957 to 51 billion jin.

　　The working people are poor but ambitious, and they use their own hands to run schools diligently and thriftily.

Tian Junliang, the representative and Director of the Education Department of Guizhou Province, proved the correctness of the central government's active promotion of people-run primary schools with the vivid example of more than 6,000 people-run primary schools developed in Guizhou Province in recent years, and explained that running schools by the masses is not only necessary but also possible.

He said that the cultural and educational undertakings in Guizhou Province have greatly developed since liberation. Now there are more than 1.63 million primary school students in the province, including 498,000 students in people-run primary schools, accounting for 30.5% of the total number of primary school students.

He said that the broad working people, although poor, are ambitious. Their enthusiasm for running schools is like a long river flowing straight ahead, and no difficulty can stop them. Some people said: "As long as the children go to school and don't become 'illiterate' like us when they grow up, we will be liberated. Although we can't afford much money now, our strength is not small. Even if it's just a little bit from everyone, we can still run a school."

He said that the people-run schools implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, and the school buildings and equipment are all simple and self-reliant. When Zhanming Primary School in San穗 County was opened, the students' parents used waste wood to make desks and blackboards; everyone used donated wood and bark and contributed their own labor to build the school buildings. It took more than 70 workdays and 12 yuan to build a school building that could accommodate 49 students. A community-run primary school in Dushan County, with the help of teachers and students, made bricks, cut grass, and used waste wood, spending only eight cents to buy nails, and built a dormitory that could accommodate 30 people. Many schools teachers and students made their own teaching aids and sports equipment. The masses especially cherish and support the schools they have built with their own hands, and when there are difficulties, everyone contributes a little effort, and they are all solved.

He said that people-run middle schools have begun to develop in Guizhou Province, with about 3,000 students now. The characteristic of running schools is that they attach equal importance to work and study. The school's arrangements for studying and farming are: half a day of studying, half a day of production; more studying on rainy days, less studying on sunny days.

He pointed out that this spirit and method of running schools diligently and thriftily can not only rely on the strength of the masses to solve the financial difficulties of schools, but also correctly implement the country's education policy and complete the task of cultivating laborers. It can enable children to establish the view that labor is glorious, develop their habit of hard work and simplicity, and be cultivated from childhood to become a new modern farmer who can use both brain and hands.

Zhang Guofan, the representative and President of Tianjin University, spoke on the topic of "We must get rid of the intellectual's airs." He said that the intellectual's airs are a product of bourgeois society, are incompatible with the current task of socialist construction, and are incompatible with the requirements of "both red and expert." Bureaucratic airs must be eliminated, and intellectual airs must also be eliminated.

Representative Huang Jiasi read the joint speech of Wang Shuzhen, Zhu Xianyi, Hu Wenyao, Ke Lin, Yu Aifeng, Liang Boqiang, Huang Jiasi, and Sun Zhongde. Their speech talked about how China's higher medical colleges have trained more than 26,000 senior health cadres for the country since liberation. After the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, China's higher medical colleges have changed the past mistake of only focusing on business and neglecting politics, realized the importance of physical labor and continuous self-transformation, and began to establish the medical work view of everything for the patient and the idea of running schools diligently and thriftily.

　　Should 600 million people share culture together, or should culture be exclusively enjoyed by intellectuals?

Xu Guangping, the representative and Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, expressed her opinions on the issue of language reform in her speech. She used many facts to illustrate that language reform meets the requirements of the broad masses of people. She said that the working people have become the masters of the country, and they urgently demand to master scientific and cultural knowledge. Language reform is to shorten the time for the working people to learn and master culture. Using the Latin alphabet to annotate Chinese characters is also to give the working people a "literacy crutch."

She said that some people are still a little hesitant about the issue of language reform. To solve this problem, we should first start from the urgent needs of 600 million people: Do we want 600 million people to share culture together, or should culture still be exclusively enjoyed by intellectuals? Should intellectuals overcome their old habits that do not meet the requirements of the times and change their bad habit of being divorced from the people, or should the broad working people still accommodate them, thereby hindering the improvement of production and hindering the progress of society? She pointed out: On the issue of language reform, we must choose our own path: Should we be promoters or accelerators?

Tong Shaosheng, the Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, and Liu Wenhui, the Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, talked about the anti-rightist struggle and rectification of the democratic parties and business community in Sichuan Province in their speeches.

Ma Xingtai (Hui), the Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Guan Baojia (Mongolian), the Governor of the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, respectively introduced the achievements of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production in Qinghai Province and the agricultural and animal husbandry production achievements of the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in written statements.

Ma Xingtai said: There are seven ethnic groups in Qinghai, including Han, Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh. In such a multi-ethnic area, 99% of the farmers in agricultural areas have joined agricultural production cooperatives. After more than two years of production exercise and multiple rectifications, the vast majority of cooperatives have increased production, increased the income of their members, and reduced natural disasters. With the change of the ownership of the means of production, national unity has been further consolidated.

Representative Lu Han (Yi), Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and Representative Guan Baojia both raised the issue of opposing local nationalism in written statements.

The representatives who spoke and submitted written statements today also included Guo Qingsi, Xia Yikun, Su Dianxuan, and Zheng Bijang.

A total of twenty-six representatives spoke and submitted written statements today.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Luo Ronghuan, Li Xuefeng, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Guohua, Rong Yiren, Shu Sheyu, Bao Erhan, Li Jinxi, Sangji Yuexi, and Zhu Shunyu.

Today's meeting ended at 7:10 PM. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

　　人民代表继续发言　典型范例动人心弦
    穷地方穷办法创造了奇迹
    辽宁贫瘠山区低产作物获得了高额丰收
    贵州群众办学培养出勤耕苦读的新农民
    据新华社5日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议今天下午三时继续举行大会讨论。各地农民群众在兴修水利的运动中表现出来的争取大跃进的革命干劲，仍然是今天代表们发言的中心。“事在人为，人定胜天”这句老话，在许多代表介绍的群众创造的生动的社会主义建设范例中，得到充分证明。
    林业部长梁希在会议一开始就对第一个五年计划期间全国林业建设情况和今后工作意见作了发言。他说：绿化祖国是全民事业，造林主要要依靠群众，依靠合作社。他希望所有山区和丘陵地区有土地和劳力的农业社，要争取每社营造“百亩林”、“千亩林”、“万亩林”；平原地区要在宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁植树，争取每户栽十棵、百棵和千棵。
　　把水引上了四十丈高的高原  群众干劲像分裂了的原子核
    陕西省省长赵寿山代表介绍陕西省人民兴修水利的劲头时说，在去年冬天的短短的三个月里，全省修成的水地就比陕西省历史上两千年所修的水地还多三十万亩。岐山县曹家乡的群众，削山劈石，开挖渠道，把河水引上四十丈高的“五丈原”，浇地五千多亩，略阳、宁强等地群众修成了“悬天堰”、“穿山堰”、“环山堰”，使稻田上了秦岭，上了巴山。群众自豪地说：“诸葛亮当年曾想引水上原（五丈原），解决军士吃水问题，但没有做到；今天共产党领导我们，居然办到了水上‘五丈原’、‘稻田飞上山’。”赵寿山说，人民群众的这种革命干劲像分裂了的原子核一样正在发挥着无穷无尽的伟大作用。
　　一把烈火烧掉爬行思想  贫瘠山地可以大大跃进
    从辽宁省来的农业劳动模范李耀先以具有无比说服力的事实，豪迈地说明了在贫瘠山区同样可以实现农业发展纲要的增产要求，同样可以在生产上大跃进。他说，他所在的凌源县高杖乡联合农业合作社，是个“山多，无山不秃；河多，无河不干”的地方，从1954年到1957年才由平均每亩粮食产量一百八十斤提高到二百一十五斤，像乌龟似的爬行。有人认为，“咱们这个‘三料（燃料、饲料、肥料）俱缺，五灾（水、旱、虫、雹、霜）俱全’的地方，能弄到这样就满足了，还想打四百斤，真是冒进作梦”。但是根据以前小块地的增产经验，去年，我们合作社的中共党组织决定无论如何也得硬着头皮试验一下，就领导农民在一百一十亩二坡地上下功夫试种谷子，居然平均每亩收了七百八十斤，高出别的地三倍多。这一下子震动了全社，大家都来看，真的可以使“高产产在二坡地上，高产出在低产作物上”。李耀先说，这个增产事实在全社变成了一把烈火，狠狠地烧掉了保守爬行思想。社员的干劲高涨，非叫全社一万五千余亩土地都像一百一十亩那样给出粮不可。现在这个社已经制订出在1959年提前八年实现农业发展纲要规定每亩产粮四百斤的计划，要同平原地区的兄弟社竞赛。
    李耀先代表说，他们社在去冬今春百分之百的劳动力都参加了兴修农田工程和积肥运动。对每一座荒山秃岭，社员们正在栽种各种树木，给它“戴帽子”；兴修梯田；给它“捆腰带”；在山下修谷坊，给秃山“打裹脚”。他兴奋地说，再过三、五年，我们就可以实现老辈人多年梦想而在个体经济时期永远办不到的“有山皆绿、有河皆清”的愿望了。
    湖北省副省长李明灏代表说，湖北省贯彻了“依靠群众，勤俭治水”的方针，去冬今春将要修建大小水利工程五亿立方公尺，相当于从1949年到1957年八年完成的总数的两倍。
    吉林省省长栗又文代表的发言，谈到了吉林省农民在冰天雪地里以排山倒海之势，冲破一切右倾保守思想的障碍，开展水利建设，向大自然进军。栗又文说，全省1月中旬已经兴修的各项水利工程超过了原计划14.16％。在与严寒苦斗中，广大群众提出了“不怕风吹，不怕天寒，修完工程再过年”，“贪大黑，起大早，跟着月亮跑”等等豪迈口号。
    安徽省省长黄岩代表在书面发言中指出，安徽省人民，去年一冬兴修水利的成绩抵上了过去的八年。他们要争取在今后五年到七年内实现全国农业发展纲要，把全省的粮食产量由1957年的二百四十亿斤提高到五百一十亿斤。
　　劳动人民虽穷而志气高  用自己双手勤俭办学校
    贵州省教育厅厅长田君亮代表在发言中以贵州省几年来发展了六千多所民办小学的生动事例，证明中央积极提倡民办小学的方针的正确，说明群众办学不但是必要，而且是可能的。
    他说，贵州省文化教育事业在解放后有了很大的发展，现在全省小学在校学生有一百六十三万多人，其中民办小学学生有四十九万八千余人，占小学生总数的30.5％。
    他说，广大劳动人民，人虽穷而志气高。他们的办学积极性有如长河流注，奋迅直前，任何困难都不能阻止他们。有些群众说：“只要娃儿读上书，不再像自己一样长大来是个‘睁眼瞎’，我们翻了身，现在能出的钱虽还不多，但力量可不小，星星点点，大家一凑也能办个学校。”
    他说，民办学校贯彻了勤俭办学的方针，校舍、设备，都是因陋就简，采取自力更生的办法来解决。三穗县展明小学开办时，学生家长利用废旧木料做课桌、黑板；大家用捐献的木料、树皮，自己出人出工来盖校舍，花了七十多个工和十二元钱，便把一所可容纳四十九个学生的校舍修好了。独山县一个社办小学，师生动手，自己打砖、割草，利用废旧木料，只花八角钱买钉子，就盖好一间可容三十人住的宿舍。许多学校师生动手自制教具和体育用具。群众对自己用双手办起来的学校，特别爱护、支持，有了困难，每人出一把力，就都解决了。
    他说，民办中学在贵州省已开始发展，现约有学生三千人，办学的特点，就是工、读并重，学校对读书和耕作的安排是：半天读书，半天生产；雨天多读，晴天少读。
    他指出，这种勤俭办学的精神和办法，既能依靠群众力量解决学校经费困难，更能正确贯彻国家的教育方针，完成培养劳动者的任务。它可以使儿童树立起劳动光荣的观点，养成他（她）们艰苦朴素的习惯，从小就被培养成为一个能脑手并用的现代新式农民。
    天津大学校长张国藩代表的发言题目是“要打掉知识分子架子”。他说，知识分子的架子是资产阶级社会的产物，是与当前社会主义建设的任务不相容的，是和“又红又专”的要求不相容的。官架子要打掉，知识分子架子也要打掉。
    黄家驷代表宣读了王淑贞、朱宪彝、胡文耀、柯麟、俞霭峰、梁伯强、黄家驷、孙仲德的联合发言。他们的发言谈到了我国高等医药学院解放后已经为国家培养了二万六千多名高级卫生干部。经过整风和反右派斗争，我国的高等医药学院已经改变过去只重业务忽视政治的错误，认识到体力劳动和不断改造自己的重要性，开始树立一切为了病人的医务工作观点和勤俭办学的思想。
　　要六亿人民共同享有文化  还是由知识分子独享文化
    中国民主促进会副主席许广平代表在发言中，对文字改革问题发表意见。她用许多事实说明文字改革符合广大人民群众的要求。她说，劳动人民成了国家的主人，他们迫切要求掌握科学文化知识。文字改革就是为了缩短劳动人民学习和掌握文化的时间。用拉丁字母给汉字注音，也是为了给劳动人民一种
  “识字拐杖”。
    她说，有些人在文字改革问题上还有点犹豫不决。要解决这个问题，首先应该从六亿人民急迫需要出发：我们究竟是要六亿人民共同享有文化，还是仍然只由知识分子独享文化？知识分子要克服自己不合时代要求的旧习惯，改变脱离人民的坏毛病，还是仍然由广大劳动人民迁就他们，从而妨碍生产的提高，阻碍社会向前发展？她指出：在文字改革问题上，我们要做促进派，还是要做促退派，必须自己选择道路。
    四川省副省长童少生、政协四川省委员会副主席刘文辉在发言中分别谈到了四川省各民主党派和工商界反右派斗争和整风的情况。
    政协青海省委员会副主席马兴泰（回）、青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州州长官保加（蒙）等二位代表在书面发言中，分别介绍了青海省农业合作化、农业生产的成就和海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州农、牧业生产成绩。
    马兴泰说：青海境内有汉、藏、回、蒙、土、撒拉、哈萨克等七个民族，在这样一个多民族地区，农业区已有99％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，经过两年多的生产锻炼和多次整顿，绝大多数社增加了产量，增加了社员收入，减轻了自然灾害。随着生产所有制的改变，更加巩固了民族团结。
    体委副主任卢汉代表（彝）和官保加代表在书面发言中，都提出反对地方民族主义问题。
    今天发言和书面发言的代表还有郭清泗、夏以焜、苏殿选、郑辟疆。
    今天发言和书面发言的代表共有二十六人。
    今天大会的执行主席是：罗荣桓、李雪峰、蔡廷锴、张国华、荣毅仁、舒舍予、包尔汉、黎锦熙、桑吉悦希、朱顺余。
    今天的大会在下午七时十分结束。明天大会将继续举行。
