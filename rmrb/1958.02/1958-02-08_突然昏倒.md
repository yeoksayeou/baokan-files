　　Why?

　　Sudden Fainting
　　Sudden fainting is a brain problem, such as cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, hysteria, epilepsy, and some cerebrovascular diseases.

    Another common situation is caused by temporary anemia in the brain. For example, people who do not exercise often have poor muscle tone and slow nerve reactions. When they suddenly stand up after squatting, inertia causes some of the blood to flow downwards. At this time, the blood in the brain is relatively reduced, leading to mild dizziness and severe sudden fainting. This phenomenon is more common in cases of physical weakness after illness. Also, sudden stimulation (such as hearing the bad news of a loved one's death) can cause blood vessels to contract tensely through nerve action, suddenly reducing the brain's blood supply, which can also cause fainting. This is medically called neurogenic shock. (Mu Feng)

专栏：为什么？

　　突然昏倒
　　突然昏倒是脑子的毛病，像脑冲血、中风、歇斯底里、癫痫以及一些脑血管的疾病。
    另外一种常见的情况是由于脑子一时性的贫血引起的。例如不常运动的人，由于肌肉紧张度不好、神经反应不快，在下蹲后突然站起来的时候，惯性使一部分的血往下流去，这时脑子的血相对减少，轻的发生眩晕，重的就突然昏倒。这种现象在病后体虚的情况下更为常见。又如受到突然的刺激（如听到亲人逝世的噩耗），通过神经作用，使血管紧张地收缩起来，大脑的供血突然减少，也会发生昏倒现象。这医学上叫神经性休克。（木风）
