    Respect Technology and Procedures, but Also Believe in Human Creativity
    Chen Zhiyan
    The report from the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant evoked some feelings that I would like to discuss here.
    The speed and quality of industrial capital construction is often strongly influenced by technology, sometimes even decisively. For example, the amount of time it takes to build a large factory is carefully and scientifically calculated beforehand, involving many complex technical issues. These are objective realities, and one cannot simply say on a whim that a factory that takes two years to build can be built in two months. We should respect objective laws, respect technology and procedures, and not act recklessly. However, we must also be clear about one thing: at all times, people are the masters of all technological activities. The creativity and revolutionary spirit of the masses can accelerate the progress of technological activities, thereby propelling our industrial construction towards a path of high-speed development. Many past examples have already proven this point. The example of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant also illustrates this.
    Acceleration does not mean omitting everything that should be done, but rather means doing everything that should be done in a day in half a day. For example, capital construction should proceed according to procedure; construction cannot begin without a design. Before a new factory officially starts production, it must undergo trial production. This is also a necessary procedure, as procedures are required by modern science and technology and embody objective laws. Anyone who violates them will make mistakes. But procedures are not rigid; people's creativity can shorten the time of each procedure. Didn't the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant come up with a way to greatly shorten the time of trial production? It's like a high-speed cutting machine tool – it speeds up the revolutions, rather than eliminating them. Undoubtedly, it is people, not the machine itself, who accelerate the revolutions. We must believe in the enormous creativity of people under the socialist system.
    In the Second Five-Year Plan, there are hundreds and thousands of large-scale projects. If each project can be completed one month, three months, or half a year ahead of the original schedule, this will not only create huge economic value for the country, but also have significant political implications.
    We believe that such good news will come one after another.

    要尊重技术和程序  也要相信人的创造力

    从武汉重型机床厂的报道中，引起了一些感触，想在这里谈一谈。
    工业基本建设的快慢好坏，技术往往是一个强大的因素，有时甚至是决定性的因素。比如一个大工厂究竟需要多少时间建成，这在事先都是经过仔细的科学计算的，其中牵涉到许多复杂的技术问题。这些都是客观存在，人们不可以灵机一动，把需要两年建成的工厂，说是两个月就能盖好。我们应当尊重客观规律，尊重技术和程序，不能胡来。但是有一点我们也必须弄清楚：任何时候，人总是一切技术活动的主宰。群众的创造力和革命精神可以加速技术活动的进程，从而把我们的工业建设，推向高速度发展的道路。过去有许多例子已经证明了这一点。武汉重型机床厂的例子也说明了这一点。
    所谓加速，并不意味着省掉一切应当做的事情，而是意味着把一天做的事情，在半天内统统做好。例如基本建设应当按程序进行，没有设计就不能施工。新工厂正式生产以前，必须要试生产，这也是程序必需的，程序是现代科学技术所要求的，它体现着客观规律，谁要违犯，就会犯错误。但程序并非僵死的，人们的创造力可以缩短每一个程序的时间。武汉重型机床厂不是就想出办法，大大缩短了试生产的时间吗？如同高速切削机床一样，是加快转数，而不是省去转数。毫无疑问，使转数加快的是人，而不是机器本身，我们必须相信社会主义制度下人的巨大创造力。
    在第二个五年计划中，有成百上千项的大工程，如果每项工程都能按原计划提前一个月、三个月、半年竣工，这不仅能为国家创造巨大的经济价值，而且有着重大的政治意义。
    我们相信这样的好消息一定会一个接着一个传来。
