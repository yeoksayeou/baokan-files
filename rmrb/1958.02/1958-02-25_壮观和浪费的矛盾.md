    The Contradiction Between Spectacle and Waste

    No one would object to building a city that is magnificent and beautiful. However, practicality is the primary consideration for buildings, while spectacle is secondary.

    But many industries that serve the public encounter a major contradiction. For example, post and telecommunications bureaus, because they serve the vast masses, must be decentralized and located on busy, important streets. Therefore, city planning in major and medium-sized cities requires them to be located on important streets, especially at intersections. If the conditions for magnificence and beauty cannot be met, construction of bureau buildings on important streets is not allowed. This has led to two situations: one is the forced construction of tall buildings. For example, the 36th Branch Bureau on Wanshou Road in Beijing built a narrow, thin, and tall five-story building, but the first floor is not enough, and there is no place for telegraph machines or mail processing. The upper floors are not easy to use, so they can only be used as temporary training classes or dormitories. The other situation is that it cannot meet the requirements of urban planning and has to withdraw from busy streets. For example, the 30th Branch Bureau in Haidian District, Beijing, and the 31st Branch Bureau on Jiulong Mountain were assigned to remote places facing wasteland. The 28th Branch Bureau next to the Soviet Exhibition Center retreated to the end of a hutong, causing great inconvenience to the masses. To be honest, for practical purposes, post and telecommunications branch bureaus only need the first floor.

    During the first Five-Year Plan, we encountered many such problems. For the sake of a magnificent cityscape, some municipal party committees or urban planning committees designated that our post and telecommunications bureaus build five, six, seven, or even eight-story buildings with four-sided clocks. If we didn't do so, we wouldn't be allowed to occupy the main streets. If we agreed to do so, we felt it was really unnecessary.

    Post and telecommunications bureaus are everywhere in the country, so contradictions exist everywhere. In fact, this contradiction is not unique to the post and telecommunications departments. Other public service departments, such as banks and bookstores, also have this problem.

    The Soviet Union's Council of Ministers decided on July 7, 1947: "In new residential and office buildings in various cities, a portion of the first floor should be allocated for use as post and telecommunications branches..." This approach not only solved the practical needs of the post and telecommunications departments but also solved the problem of unified urban planning, magnificence without waste.

    I hope that our China can also thoroughly solve the problem of unified construction planning for post and telecommunications enterprises and other service departments, so that the contradiction between spectacle and waste will not continue in the second Five-Year Plan.

### 壮观和浪费的矛盾

    壮观和浪费的矛盾
    把一个城市建设得壮观美丽，谁也不会反对。但是，房屋建筑实用是主要的，壮观是次要的。
    但是许多为公众服务的行业，就遇到一个大矛盾。例如邮电局，因为它是为广大群众服务的，必须分散，同时又必须建在繁华冲要街道上。因而各大中城市规划都要求它设在冲要街道，特别是十字路口上。不能达到壮丽美观的条件，就不允许在冲要街道上修建局房。因而出现了两种情况：一种是勉强修建高楼。如北京万寿路三十六支局，盖了一个又窄又瘦又高的五层楼房，但弄得第一层不够用，连电报机都没处放，邮件没地方处理，而楼上几层又不好使用，只得作为开办临时训练班或宿舍之用。另一种情况是不能配合城市规划要求，只好退出繁华街道。如北京海淀区的三十支局，九龙山的三十一支局，被划到面向荒地的偏僻地方，苏联展览馆旁边的二十八支局，退到胡同底藏了起来，使群众非常不便。老实说，真正为了实用，邮电支局只需要第一层。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们遇到很多这样的问题。为了市容壮观，有的市委或城市规划委员会，指定我们邮电局建五层六层七层甚至八层还加四面钟的大楼。不这样做就不允许占在主要街道上，答应这样做，又感觉实在没有必要。
    全国到处都有邮电局所，因而到处都有矛盾。其实，这种矛盾，也不单是邮电部门有，其他为公众服务部门，如银行、书店等，也有这种问题。
    苏联在1947年7月7日部长会议曾决定：“各城市新建住宅和机关房屋，应在第一层拨出一部分作邮电分支机构使用……”。这种办法既解决了邮电部门的实际需要，也解决了城市统一规划、壮观而不浪费的问题。
    我希望我们中国也能彻底解决一下邮电企业以及其他服务部门的统一建筑规划问题，省得在第二个五年计划期间，壮观与浪费再继续矛盾下去。
