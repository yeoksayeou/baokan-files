Turning Left is the Only Bright Future for Industrialists and Businessmen
Industrialists and businessmen must resolve with unwavering will to fundamentally transform their bourgeois essence and strive to take a big step to the left. Private personnel in Harbin are determined to produce new products and catch up with the British level in a short period of time, contributing their strength.

Speech by Delegate Liu Peizhi
    I fully agree with and endorse Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft of the 1958 national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft of the 1958 national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. I also suggest that the conference adopt them.

    This conference is a conference to welcome a new upsurge in socialist construction. Under the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the unanimous unity and efforts of the people of the whole country, our country's socialist construction has achieved great and unprecedented victories. Following the basic economic victory in 1956, the socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory in the political and ideological fields in 1957 through the whole-people rectification and the anti-rightist struggle. The first Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed and overfulfilled, establishing a preliminary industrial foundation in our country. In the face of these victories, the Party and the government have timely proposed the 1958 national economic development plan, and the Party Central Committee has also put forward the call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer. This is very encouraging. The people of the whole country have been greatly inspired and are courageously forging ahead to achieve this glorious task!

    Our Heilongjiang Province's industrial and commercial circles, with the rectification movement centered on repelling the rightists, breaking with the capitalist stance, and establishing the socialist stance as the content of education, under the leadership of the Party, has achieved a decisive victory after more than half a year. A group of 155 rightists of all kinds have been exposed one after another. Under the sunlight of truth, they have all revealed their true colors, and their ugly faces have been exposed to the people. The rightists have been beaten by the masses and their reputation is ruined, and they are isolated and deserted. Most of them have bowed their heads and confessed to the people. This struggle vividly and concretely educated the majority of industrialists and businessmen, made them realize the major issues of right and wrong, and made them realize that following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road is the only bright future. They must make up their minds to change their position. Therefore, the majority of industrialists and businessmen have begun to look to the left, and some are gradually transforming to the left. At the same time, after the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, some people have made significant progress. For example, after the end of the anti-rightist struggle in Harbin City, our province, when the general rectification was underway, in order to closely integrate the rectification with the great leap forward in production, under the leadership of the Party, some industrialists and businessmen stated at the recently held "Industrial and Commercial Circles Transform Their Stance, Take the Socialist Road, and Realize the Great Leap Forward in Production" oath-taking meeting that they were determined to change their stance, boost their energy, and work with the people of the whole country to contribute their strength to realizing our country's catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years. Private personnel of the Harbin Public-Private Joint Venture Liyan Electrical Factory proposed: To ensure the trial production of new products such as steam turbine generators, AC welding machines, and power transformers in 1958, and to reach the domestic advanced level in 1960, and catch up with or surpass the British level in 1962. Private personnel of the Public-Private Joint Venture Qunli Iron Factory proposed: To successfully trial-produce motorcycle and bicycle engines, and hand-cranked hoists in 1958, and catch up with the British level in three to five years. Some industrialists and businessmen also proposed: To save raw materials on the premise of ensuring product quality. In addition, some industrialists and businessmen are more serious and responsible for enterprise work than in the past, willing to go to the workshops to learn from workers, and have begun to get used to criticism and self-criticism, etc., all of which are concrete manifestations of progress.

    Through socialist education, the small industrialists and businessmen in our province have also improved their political and ideological awareness. For example, small industrialists and businessmen in Harbin City were very active in subscribing to national economic construction bonds this year, overfulfilling the task of subscription and payment in six days, three months earlier than last year, which is also a new phenomenon that did not exist in the past. The facts have proved that, based on the socialist education of the anti-rightist struggle, the political stance of industrialists and businessmen in our province has begun to change, and they have taken a big step on the road to transforming themselves into self-reliant laborers.

    Under this new situation, we industrialists and businessmen should make the greatest efforts to further strengthen self-education and self-transformation. We know that because industrialists and businessmen have lived the life of the exploiting class without working for a long time, capitalist ideology is deeply ingrained, and changing political stance is, after all, arduous, and ideological transformation is a long-term task. Therefore, we industrialists and businessmen must first realize that the current comprehensive rectification is an important stage in transforming our stance and transforming our thinking. We must continue to participate in the comprehensive rectification with the greatest enthusiasm, to further eliminate the capitalist stance and thinking, establish the socialist stance and thinking, and, more importantly, to make up our minds with unwavering will to fundamentally transform the bourgeois essence, carry out a thorough transformation, in order to strive to take a big step to the left. Secondly, we should strive to study theory and current affairs policies, and systematically improve our ideological level in a planned way. More importantly, we should actively participate in labor practice based on the principle of taking enterprises as the transformation base, and contribute all our strength to the great leap forward in production. We wholeheartedly and unswervingly accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, sincerely learn from the working class, learn their noble qualities, gradually change capitalist ideology, recognize the ugliness and shamefulness of the bourgeoisie and exploitation, actively participate in various movements, accept education in the movements, and sincerely accept socialist transformation. According to the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, we should earnestly achieve increased production and economy, produce more products for the country, do a good job in market supply, and accumulate more funds for the country. We should contribute to socialist construction and strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer.

    向左转是工商业者的唯一光明前途
    工商业者要以坚定不移的意志痛下决心，从根本上改造资产阶级实质，力争向左跨进一大步。哈尔滨的私方人员，决心要制成一些新产品，在短期内赶上英国水平，贡献出自己的力量。
    刘珮芝代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告和吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告。并建议大会通过。
    这次大会是一个迎接社会主义建设新高潮的大会。我们国家在中国共产党的正确英明的领导下，在全国人民的一致团结和努力下，社会主义建设已经取得了伟大的史无前例的胜利。社会主义革命继一九五六年在经济上取得了基本胜利以后，在一九五七年通过全民整风和反右派斗争，在政治上、思想上的社会主义革命也取得了决定性的胜利。第一个五年计划已经胜利地完成和超额完成了，在我国建立了工业化的初步基础。在这些胜利的形势下，党和政府适时地提出一九五八年度国民经济发展计划，同时党中央还提出了在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其它重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召，这是十分振奋人心的事情。全国人民已鼓起了极大的革命干劲，正在乘风破浪地勇往直前地为实现这一光荣任务而奋斗！ 
    我们黑龙江省工商界以反击右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为教育内容的整风运动，在党的领导下，历半年多的时间，已经取得了决定性的胜利，先后已揭露出一批形形色色的右派分子一百五十五人。他们在真理阳光之下，纷纷现了原形，丑恶面目暴露在人民面前，右派分子被群众打得声名狼籍，众叛亲离，大多数已陷于孤立，表示向人民低头认罪。这一斗争生动而又具体地教育了大多数的工商业者认识了大是大非，觉悟到只有跟共产党走社会主义道路，才是唯一的光明前途，要痛下决心，改变立场。因而工商业者中间大多数人已开始向左看，有些人正在逐步向左转化。同时在反右派斗争胜利以后，有些人已经有了显著的进步表现，如我省的哈尔滨市在反右派斗争结束后，一般整风在进行中，为了使整风和生产大跃进很好地结合起来，在党的领导下，于最近举行的“工商界改造立场，走社会主义道路，实现生产大跃进”誓师大会上，有些工商业者，表示决心改变立场，鼓起干劲同全国人民一道，为实现我国在十五年左右在钢铁和重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，贡献出自己的力量。哈尔滨公私合营力研电气厂的私方人员提出：保证在一九五八年内试制的汽轮发电机、交流电焊机、电力变压器等新产品，并且要在一九六○年达到国内先进水平，一九六二年赶上或超过英国水平。公私合营群力铁工厂私方人员提出：要在一九五八年度试制成功摩托车、自行车发动机，和手炼起重机，并在三、五年内赶上英国水平。有些工商业者还提出：在保证产品质量的前提下，节约原材料的计划。此外有的工商业者对企业工作比过去认真负责，愿下车间向工人学习，以及开始习惯于批评与自我批评等方面，这都是进步的具体表现。
    我省的小型工商业者，通过了社会主义教育，政治思想觉悟也有所提高，如哈尔滨市小型工商业者在今年认购国家经济建设公债中，表现非常活跃，在六天时间内，超额完成认购和交款任务，较去年提前三个月，这也是过去所没有的新景象。事实证明了，我省工商业者在反右派斗争的社会主义教育的基础上，工商业者的政治立场已开始有所转变，他们在把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者的道路上大大地迈进了一步。
    在这种新的形势下，我们工商业者应以最大的努力，进一步加强自我教育和自我改造。我们知道，工商业者由于长时期过着剥削阶级不劳而食的生活，资本主义思想是根深蒂固的，改变政治立场毕竟是艰巨的，思想改造更是一个长期的任务。因此，我们工商业者首先应当认识到当前的全面整风是改造立场、改造思想的重要的一关。我们必须继续以最大的积极性参加全面整风，以进一步破除资本主义立场和思想，树立社会主义的立场和思想，更要以坚定不移的意志痛下决心从根本上改造资产阶级实质，进行脱胎换骨的改造，方能争取向左跨进一大步。其次应当努力学习理论和时事政策，有计划地系统地提高自己的思想水平。更重要的是，应根据以企业为改造基地的原则，积极参加劳动实践，为生产大跃进贡献出一切力量。我们一心一意坚定不移地接受中国共产党的领导，诚诚恳恳地向工人阶级学习，学习他们的高贵品质，逐步转变资本主义的思想意识，认清资产阶级和剥削的丑恶可耻，积极参加各种运动，在运动中接受教育，真诚地接受社会主义改造。根据多、快、好、省的方针，认真作到增产节约，为国家生产更多的产品，作好市场供应，为国家积累更多的资金。为社会主义建设贡献力量，为实现在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面，在十五年或者更多一点的时间内赶上或超过英国而奋斗。
