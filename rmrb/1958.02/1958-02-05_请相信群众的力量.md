Please Believe in the Power of the Masses
Jiang Hao

    In the patriotic health campaign of eliminating the four pests, the broad masses are waging a fierce battle against the four pests with the heroic spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." This is an unprecedentedly great event, a heroic feat of the Chinese people. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can we concentrate the demands of the masses, put forward slogans for action, and mobilize the broad masses to struggle to realize this demand. The combination of leadership and the masses has generated incomparable great strength.

    The current situation is: on the one hand, there have appeared thousands upon thousands of "four-without" townships, villages, communes, and units; on the other hand, the "four-without" zones are only points, not yet connected into areas, the development of the movement is still uneven, and there are many gaps. This situation shows that the leading comrades in some places have not fully estimated the enthusiasm and urgent demands of the broad masses for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, and therefore they could not estimate the tenacious and persistent efforts that the broad masses would make in this regard, and therefore they have not strengthened leadership.

    Our working people have always had a tradition of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene. Scarecrows are the image of anti-sparrow guardians created by the working people, and the New Year's Eve sweeping is a hygienic custom left by the working people... However, because the working people have been oppressed by the exploiting classes for generations and could not even secure their livelihoods, how could they pay attention to hygiene? The Chinese Communist Party liberated the Chinese people, realized the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production, and ended the system of man exploiting man. Once the broad working people throw off the shackles around their necks, they generate infinite power, a power like a volcanic eruption, like the infinite heat released by the fission of an atomic nucleus. Now, people are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the great socialist construction and into the high tide of the national production leap forward. Every worker demands to be a healthy worker, to work even more excellently, and naturally demands to further eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. Therefore, those miracles that could not have been imagined in the past, miracles that capitalist countries dare not imagine, have appeared. The people who created these miracles are thousands upon thousands of ordinary masses, the liberated people. We can find such people almost everywhere; they include workers, peasants, soldiers, housewives, and children... Zhu Zhaoyi from Anhui Province, Auntie Lu from Nanjing, Xiao Jigui from Ji'an... These men and women, old and young heroes, have persisted in the activity of eliminating the four pests for years as if it were one day, capturing thousands upon thousands of sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, and rats. In this way, driven by these activists and through the efforts of the broad masses, one "four-without" zone after another has emerged. From this, we see that the broad working people possess endless power for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, enough to eliminate the four pests completely.

    Unfortunately, some comrades have not seen the demands of the masses and cannot fully estimate the power of the masses. Some comrades even believe that since the masses have the demands and power to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, then why should we vigorously publicize and mobilize? They do not know that although the masses have the desire for health, due to the backwardness of scientific and cultural knowledge in the past and the influence of superstitious or ignorant ideas, a portion of the masses still do not know how to obtain health. As long as we explain the significance of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene to the masses thoroughly, the masses will actively take action. The power of the broad working people to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene is endless. However, after the masses rise up, the cadres of the Party and the state have the responsibility to lead and organize the people to throw themselves into this struggle, eliminate the gaps, and create four-without counties, four-without cities, and a four-without country.

    How to lead the masses? Sitting in the office issuing orders and gesticulating is not the correct leadership method. Leading comrades at all levels need to step out of the office, go into practice, go to the masses, and delve into a village or a street. Only when the leading staff work together with the masses to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene will they see the urgent demands and great power of the masses. If we fully mobilize the masses, truly achieve "every household knows," "every household mobilizes, everyone acts," and truly achieve concentration and perseverance, if the people of one village do this, the people of one county do this, and the 600 million people of the country do this, then the miracle of a "four-without" country will be realized. The Wu Lao Village in Nanjing, the Taiyang Village in Shanxi Province, the Fusui Jing in Beijing, the Quanxin Alley in Chengdu, and hundreds and thousands of other regions that have already achieved "four-without" have erected "four-without" red flags in front of the people of the whole country. Isn't this the clearest and most distinct signpost? Recently, after fully estimating the potential of the masses and all favorable conditions, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China revised the plan to become a "four-without" province in eight years, deciding to accelerate the pace and become a "four-without" province in four years. After seeing the enthusiasm and potential of the masses, Guangzhou criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking in leadership and decided to realize the plan to eliminate the four pests in five years two years ahead of schedule. All of this is enough to show that the power of the masses is indeed endless, and leaders can only step out of the office, go into practice, and go to the masses, and only through practice and experimentation can they truly see the endless potential of the masses, increase confidence, and find methods, can they break the skepticism and pessimism in eliminating the four pests, and the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests can leap forward.

    Please believe in the power of the masses to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene! The responsibility of the leaders lies in using correct methods to mobilize the masses. Look at the history of many years from now, and you will praise the heroic people who eliminated the four pests and promoted hygiene.

　　请相信群众的力量
　　江浩
    在除四害、讲卫生运动中，广大群众以“愚公移山”的英雄气概向四害展开激战。这是一件旷古未闻的大事情，是中国人民的豪举。只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能集中群众的要求，提出行动口号，并且动员广大群众，为实现这个要求而奋斗。领导与群众相结合，便发生了无可比拟的伟大力量。
    目前的情况是：一方面，出现了千千万万“四无”的乡、村、社和单位；另外一方面，“四无”地带只是成点，还未连片，运动的发展还不平衡，有许多空白。这种情况说明，有些地方的领导同志还没有充分估计到广大人民对于除四害、讲卫生的积极性和迫切要求，因而也就不可能估计到广大人民会在这方面作出坚韧持久的努力，也就没有去加强领导。
    我国劳动人民一向具有爱清洁、讲卫生的传统。稻草人是劳动人民创造的防雀卫士的形象，除夕扫尘是劳动人民留下的卫生风俗……。不过由于劳动人民历代受到剥削阶级压迫，生活尚且不保，还能讲求什么卫生？中国共产党解放了中国人民，实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，结束了人剥削人的制度。广大劳动人民一旦丢掉了自己颈上的枷锁，便产生出无穷无尽的力量，这个力量正如火山爆发，正如原子核分裂所发出的无限热量。现在，人们正在以饱满热情投身于伟大的社会主义建设，投身于全国生产大跃进的高潮。每一个劳动者都要求自己是健康的劳动者，劳动得更加出色，自然更要求进一步除四害、讲卫生。所以那些过去不能想像得到的奇迹，资本主义国家所不敢想像的奇迹出现了。创造这些奇迹的人，是成千成万平凡的群众，是解放了的人民。我们几乎到处都可以找到这样的人们，他们中有工人，农民，战士，家庭妇女，少年儿童……。安徽省的朱兆义，南京市的鲁大妈，吉安市的萧纪贵……，这些男男女女，老老少少的英雄们数年如一日地坚持除四害活动，捕捉了千千万万的麻雀、蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠。就这样，在这些积极分子带动下，在广大群众的努力下，一个又一个的“四无”地带出现了。我们从这里看到广大劳动人民蕴藏着除四害、讲卫生的力量无穷无尽，足能使四害灭尽而后已。
    可惜的是，有些同志没有看到群众的要求，不能充分估计群众的力量。有的同志甚至认为，群众既然有除四害、讲卫生的要求和力量，那为什么还要大力宣传动员？他们不知道群众虽然有健康的要求，但是由于过去科学文化知识的落后，受到迷信或愚昧思想的影响，群众中有一部分人还不知道怎样才能得到健康。只要我们把除四害、讲卫生的意义向群众说透，群众就会积极地行动起来。广大劳动人民蕴藏着的除四害、讲卫生的力量是无穷无尽的。但是群众起来以后，党和国家的干部有责任去领导和组织人民群众投入这个斗争，消灭空白，造成四无县、四无市、四无国。
    怎样去领导群众呢？坐在办公室里发号施令、指手划脚，不是正确的领导方法。各级领导同志有必要走出办公室，到实际中去，到群众中去，深入一个村、一条街。领导工作人员只有同群众一起除四害、讲卫生，才会看到群众的迫切要求和伟大力量。如果我们充分发动了群众，真正做到了“家喻户晓”，“家家动员，人人动手”，真正做到集中起来，坚持下去，一个村的人民这样做了，一个县的人民这样做了，全国六亿人民都这样做了，那么，“四无”国的奇迹就会实现。南京市的五老村，山西省的太阳村，北京市的福绥境，成都市的全心巷，以及成百成千个已经实现“四无”的地区，在全国人民的面前树起了“四无”红旗，这难道不是最清楚鲜明的路标吗？最近中共江苏省委在充分估计了群众的潜力和一切有利条件以后，重新修订了八年成为“四无”省的规划，决定加快步伐，提前在四年内成为“四无”省。广州市在看到群众的积极性和潜力以后，批判了领导上的右倾保守思想，决定把五年消灭四害的规划，提早两年实现。这一切都足以说明，群众的力量确实无穷无尽，领导者只有走出办公室，到实际中去，到群众中去，经过实践和试验，才能真正看到群众的无穷潜力，提高信心，找到办法，才能打破除四害中的怀疑论和悲观论，以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动才能飞跃前进。
    请相信群众除四害、讲卫生的力量吧！领导者的责任就在于运用正确的方法去发动群众。看多少年后的历史，便会称颂除四害、讲卫生的英雄人民。
