    Change Old Perspectives, Abandon Old Methods
    Chen Zhiyan
    With the great leap forward in the two major production sectors of industry and agriculture, all aspects of our country's work will inevitably experience a new leap forward. This is the new situation in our country's current socialist construction. We must use new perspectives to observe this new situation, draw necessary conclusions from it, and deploy our work accordingly; otherwise, there is a risk of falling behind the situation and being unable to catch up.
    The new situation is extremely beneficial to the development of the socialist cause, but it also brings a series of new problems that must be solved with new methods, that is, revolutionary methods. Otherwise, the new situation cannot bring about a new leap.
    Jiangxi Province's full assessment of the new situation of the great leap forward in local industry, and its use of revolutionary methods to plan for the cadres needed for the great development of local industry, is very enlightening to us.
    Jiangxi wants to increase the total output value of local industry by five and a half times this year, thereby catching up with agriculture. This is a leap forward. However, to achieve this leap forward, the cooperation of all aspects of work is necessary. Among them, the cadre work must first keep up. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee immediately grasped this key and proposed a plan to send 20,000 cadres to local industry. This plan is the result of observing, analyzing, and judging the new situation using new perspectives.
    The so-called perspective is people's understanding of the objective situation. As the objective situation constantly changes, our understanding must keep up with this change, so that our subjective world conforms to the requirements of objective development. Therefore, we need to change our old perspectives in time and use new perspectives to look at problems. Because a new perspective signifies the consistency between subjective understanding and the objective situation, while an old perspective signifies the disconnect between the two.
    The great development of local industry must have a large number of cadres, but what methods should be used to train this large number of cadres? This is a new problem under the new situation.
    This problem can be solved with an old method, which is to transfer a group of cadres from other positions to the industrial front. Jiangxi did not simply adopt this method. They adopted another new method. They also transferred a group of cadres, but they did not immediately ask them to be cadres or leaders in enterprises. Instead, they first asked them to be workers for several years, to learn an operating skill each, and then go to factories and mines as management cadres and enterprise leaders. Cadres who are already working in enterprises are also required to take off work for several months each year to be workers and learn technology. Isn't this a new method of cultivating builders who are both red and expert? Undoubtedly, this is a revolutionary method worth promoting.
    Unfortunately, not all comrades and all places have observed problems and solved problems with new perspectives and new methods. To this day, there are still some comrades and some departments who look at the new situation with old perspectives. It is as if the rain and wind in the sky have not wet their clothes at all. Some people, because the situation is pressing, have to go into battle and shout a few "leap forward" slogans, but the methods they use to solve problems are still the old methods of "everything as usual." There is almost no revolutionary atmosphere to be smelled in their place. Therefore, it is very doubtful whether there is a real leap forward. If we are willing to be innovators who understand the new situation and break with conventions, then we must change our old perspectives and abandon old methods.

    改变老眼光  抛弃旧方法
    陈之衍
    随着工业和农业这两大生产部门的跃进，我国各方面的工作都必然将出现一个新的跃进。这是我国当前社会主义建设的新形势。我们必须用新的眼光来观察这种新的形势，并从中得出必要的结论，来部署自己的工作，否则就有落在形势后面而赶不上去的危险。
    新的形势对于社会主义事业的发展是极其有利的，但是也带来了一系列的新问题，必须要用新的方法也就是革命的方法去解决这些新问题。否则新的形势也不能带来新的飞跃。
    江西省充分估计了地方工业大跃进的新形势，用革命的方法规划地方工业大发展所需干部的事例，对我们很有启发作用。
    江西要在今年内把地方工业的总产值提高五倍半，从而赶上农业，这是一种飞跃。但是要实现这种飞跃，必须要有各方面工作的配合。其中首先是干部工作必须跟上去。江西省委即时抓住了这条关键，提出了向地方工业输送两万干部的规划。这个规划，即使用新眼光来观察、分析、判断新形势的结果。
    所谓眼光，即人对客观形势的认识。客观形势不断变化，我们的认识必须跟上这种变化，使自己的主观世界符合于客观发展的要求。因此我们就需要及时改变自己的老眼光，用新眼光来看问题。因为新眼光标志着主观认识和客观形势的一致，而老眼光则标志着这两者的脱节。
    地方工业的大发展必须要有大批的干部，但是用什么方法来培养训练这大批干部呢？这就是新形势下的新问题。
    解决这个问题可以用一种老办法，这就是从其它岗位上调集一批干部到工业战线上去。江西没有简单地采取这种办法。他们采取的是另外一种新的方法。他们也调集了一批干部，但没有马上要他们去企业当干部、当领导人，而是首先要他们去当几年工人，要每个人学会一门操作技术，然后再到工厂、矿山当管理干部、当企业的领导人。已经在企业工作的干部也要他们每年脱职几个月去当工人学技术。试问这不是培养又红又专的建设者的新方法吗？无疑这是一种值得提倡的革命方法。
    可惜的是并不是一切同志、一切地方都已用新眼光新办法来观察问题和解决问题。迄今仍然有一些同志、一些部门用老眼光来看新形势。好像漫天的风雨，没有打湿他们一点衣裳。有的人，由于形势逼人，不得不上阵喊几声“跃进”，但是他们解决问题的方法仍然用的是“一切如常”的旧方法，在他们那里几乎嗅不到什么革命气味。因此有没有真正的跃进，是很可怀疑的。如果我们愿意做一个洞察新形式、打破陈规的革新家，那么我们就必须改变老眼光，抛弃旧方法。
