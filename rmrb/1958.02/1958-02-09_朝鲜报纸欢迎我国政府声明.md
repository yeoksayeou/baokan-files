Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: Pyongyang newspapers today published editorials warmly welcoming and supporting the statement issued by the Chinese government on February 7th.

    The editorial in "Rodong Sinmun" stated that this statement by the Chinese government once again demonstrates China's consistent sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.

    The editorial pointed out that this statement by the Chinese government is of tremendous significance. The Korean people warmly welcome and support this statement by the Chinese government and express their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and the entire Chinese people for the comprehensive support and sympathy they have consistently provided to the Korean people in their cause of striving for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

    The editorial condemned the illegal acts of U.S. imperialism in forcibly occupying South Korea, seriously violating the armistice agreement, and engaging in military provocations. The editorial emphasized that to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, all foreign troops must first be withdrawn from Korea. The editorial stated that the Chinese government has already expressed its readiness to consult with the Korean government immediately on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. Therefore, the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea is now a question of whether the troops of the United States and other vassal states will withdraw. The editorial said, we believe that the time has come for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.

    "Minju Choson" also published an editorial today stating that the Chinese government's statement once again demonstrates the Chinese people's efforts and firm stance towards peacefully resolving the Korean issue and easing tensions in Korea and Asia.

    据新华社平壤8日电　平壤报纸今天发表社论，表示热烈欢迎和支持中国政府在2月7日发表的声明。
    “劳动新闻”发表的社论说，中国政府的这一声明再一次表明中国为和平解决朝鲜问题和维护远东与世界和平的一贯诚意。
    社论指出，中国政府的这一声明具有非常巨大的意义。朝鲜人民热烈欢迎和支持中国政府的这一声明，并且对中国政府和全体中国人民对朝鲜人民为争取祖国和平统一的事业经常给予的全面支持和同情表示由衷的感谢。
    社论谴责了美帝国主义强占南朝鲜、严重破坏停战协定和进行军事挑衅等非法行为。社论强调指出，要和平解决朝鲜问题，首先应当使一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。社论说，中国政府已经表示准备立即同朝鲜政府就中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的问题进行磋商，因此，外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题就应该是美国和其他仆从国家的军队是否撤出朝鲜的问题了。社论说，我们认为，美国军队立即撤出南朝鲜的时候已经来到。
