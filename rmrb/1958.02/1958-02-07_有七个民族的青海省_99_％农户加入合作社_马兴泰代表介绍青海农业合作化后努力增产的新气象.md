I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on current language reform work and the Chinese phonetic alphabet. I will resolutely implement these in future work. Now I will speak about the agricultural development in Qinghai Province. Please offer criticism and corrections where appropriate. Qinghai is home to seven ethnic groups: Han, Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh. In this multi-ethnic region, thanks to the correct implementation by the Party and the government of the central government's guidelines, policies, and measures regarding the agricultural cooperative movement, we in Qinghai Province have achieved great success, just like other parts of the country. As of now, 99 percent of farming households in agricultural areas have joined agricultural production cooperatives; the province has 2,599 agricultural cooperatives, of which 1,420 are joint cooperatives composed of two or more ethnic groups. After more than two years of production practice and multiple reorganizations, especially after the rural socialist debate and the general discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft), these agricultural cooperatives have not only become more consolidated but have also greatly demonstrated their unparalleled superiority. In summary, the main points are:

	The Enthusiasm of the Members Has Been Greatly Enhanced; The Vast Majority of Cooperatives Have Increased Production
	I. The victory of the agricultural cooperativization movement has greatly enhanced the production enthusiasm of the members. The vast majority of cooperatives have increased their yields, increased the income of their members, and reduced the impact of natural disasters. In 1957, nearly one million mu of cultivated land in our province's agricultural areas suffered from varying degrees of drought, hail, flooding, and other disasters. However, due to the great strength of being organized, farmers of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Party, launched a vigorous production and drought resistance movement, and adopted vigorous water conservancy projects and other effective measures. Not only did this reduce the impact of natural disasters, but, calculating for the entire province, production increased by 4.6 percent compared to 1956. In many areas, vivid examples of bumper harvests appeared last year. For example, 138.4 mu of wheat in the Qianjin Cooperative of Tangnaihai Village, Xinghai County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and 40 mu of wheat in the Planning Cooperative, had an average yield of more than 850 jin per mu. The Qianjin Cooperative's 23.1 mu of soybeans (broad beans) had an average yield of 900 jin per mu. The entire village is expected to increase grain production by more than 500,000 jin in 1957 compared to 1956, increasing the income of more than 80 percent of the members. The advanced agricultural cooperative in Qilian County had four mu of dry mountain land with a yield of 625 jin per mu. The per mu yield of Qianjin Cooperative in QingShui Township of Xunhua, Sujiahewan Cooperative of Xining, and Shuguang Cooperative of Huangyuan has now reached an average of more than 400 jin. In 1957, Huzhu Tu Autonomous County suffered from the dual threat of drought and hail. More than half of the county's sown area was affected by one or both of these natural disasters, with yield reductions ranging from 10 to 55 percent. However, thanks to the strong leadership of the Party, farmers of all ethnic groups took various active measures to greatly reduce the damage, enabling 65 percent of the county's agricultural cooperatives to increase production, and 10 percent of the cooperatives to maintain the previous year's income. The county's grain and oil crops are expected to increase by 3.6 percent in 1957 compared to 1956.

	Unifying and Rationally Using Land and Labor; Carrying out Large-Scale Agricultural Capital Construction
	II. Due to cooperativization, means of production and production funds, especially land and labor, have been unified and rationally used, making it possible to carry out large-scale agricultural capital construction. The most prominent aspect of this is farmland water conservancy. In 1957, the task of developing 200,500 mu of irrigated area in the province was successfully completed. The target for the development of irrigated area in Qinghai Province's first Five-Year Plan was 572,000 mu. By the end of 1956, 599,700 mu had been developed, completing the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 4.84 percent. Calculated by the end of 1957, the Five-Year Plan developed 804,800 mu of irrigated area, equivalent to 140.68 percent of the original Five-Year Plan. Over the past five years, the increase in grain production due to the conversion of dry land to irrigated land in the province has reached 340 million jin. In terms of afforestation, the province's first Five-Year Plan called for 185,385 mu of afforestation, while the actual amount afforested was more than 486,000 mu. In terms of soil and water conservation, in 1956 and 1957, the province controlled soil erosion over a total area of 1,250 square kilometers. These concrete examples fully demonstrate that only under the leadership of the Party and the realization of agricultural cooperativization can rural productive forces be thoroughly liberated and open up broad prospects for development. Otherwise, it would be impossible to achieve the above results in a short period of time.

	Blocking the Side Road to Capitalism; Avoiding Class Differentiation in Rural Areas
	III. Due to the fundamental change in production relations, it is necessary to take the bright road of socialism, thus blocking the side road to capitalism and avoiding class differentiation in rural areas. Before liberation, farmers of all ethnic groups suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of landlords and rich peasants. They were unable to clothe themselves properly, could not eat their fill, and were heavily in debt. For example, in the Conglin Agricultural Cooperative in Huangzhong County, one production team of 59 households owed landlords 56,100 jin of grain, 572 silver dollars, and had mortgaged 411 mu of land before liberation, paying landlords 146,970 jin of grain in interest each year. After liberation, after the land reform movement, although the lives of the farmers had improved to a certain extent, before cooperativization, because the roots of rural capitalism had not been eradicated, class differentiation was still inevitable. For example, in Nengkou, Ledu County, out of 122 households in four villages, in 1953 (after land reform), 18 households were engaged in speculative business (peddling livestock). The buying and selling of land and livestock was very serious. In the four villages, 20 households bought land, totaling 156 mu, while 14 households sold land, selling 86 mu. During the land reform in 1951, 32 poor and hired peasant households were allocated 11 mules, 3 horses, and 4 donkeys. By the end of 1953, 18 households had sold all nine mules, three horses, four donkeys, and five cattle. These facts of class differentiation completely disappeared after cooperativization. Therefore, the farmers all said, "If it weren't for cooperativization, a few people would get rich and the majority would remain poor, just like before land reform."

	Changing the Ownership of Production Means Consolidates Ethnic Unity; Ethnic Relations Become Socialist Ethnic Relations
	IV. With the change in the ownership of the means of production, ethnic unity has been further consolidated, and ethnic relations have become socialist ethnic relations. This is reflected in the joint establishment of cooperatives by different ethnic groups. Farmers of all ethnic groups not only have completely consistent political and economic interests, but also, through common labor, get closer to each other, understand each other, and eliminate the ethnic barriers of the past in their lives, establishing a close relationship of mutual assistance, mutual love, mutual respect, and mutual learning, thereby enabling them to work together to develop production. For example, the Guanting Agricultural Cooperative in Minhe County has six ethnic groups who are as united as a family. During the high tide of cooperativization, female Tu cooperative members patiently taught female Hui cooperative members agricultural production techniques such as weeding. During weddings, funerals, and festivals, cooperative members of all ethnic groups helped each other and took care of each other. There are many such examples.

In addition to the above four main aspects, the superiority of agricultural cooperativization is also reflected in vigorously improving agricultural production technology, developing diversified operations, supporting industrial and urban construction, and resettling immigrants. The achievements made due to the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperativization are unprecedented.

	The Province Launches Water Conservancy and Manure Accumulation Campaigns; A Large-Scale Upsurge in Agricultural Production is Unleashed
	In 1958, our province will launch a large-scale upsurge in agricultural production, increasing total grain output by 21.8 percent on the basis of 1.28 billion jin in 1957, reaching 1.56 billion jin, an increase of 280 million jin. In order to prepare for the large-scale agricultural production in 1958, a large-scale water conservancy and manure accumulation campaign has been launched within the province since October last year. As of January 20 this year, the province's water conservancy plan has reached 1,014,485 mu, and the completed projects can expand the irrigated area by 200,000 mu. The water conservancy projects under construction can expand the irrigated area by another 533,447 mu. In 1958, the province plans to increase fertilizer application by 25 to 30 percent. Due to the gradual overcoming of right-leaning conservative thinking in many areas, the original fertilizer increase plan has been revised, raising the 1958 fertilizer increase target. For example, Xining City and Datong County plan to increase fertilizer application by 70 percent compared to 1957, Hualong Hui Autonomous County by 42 percent, and Xunhua and other places by more than 30 percent. At present, about 10 percent of the province's agricultural cooperatives have basically completed their fertilizer accumulation plan, and two-thirds of the cooperatives have completed about 80 percent of their fertilizer accumulation plan. The fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy campaign has formed a high tide in every corner of Qinghai. People of all ethnic groups in the province have a strong will and firm confidence in completing the task of large-scale agricultural production in 1958. Our conditions for certain victory are: First of all, we have the correct leadership of the Party. After the rural socialist debate and the study of the National Agricultural Development Program, we have forcefully cracked down on the destructive activities of unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements, criticized capitalist ideology, strengthened the determination of people of all ethnic groups to take the socialist road, and greatly increased their labor enthusiasm. At the same time, a large number of cadres sent to the lower levels have strengthened grassroots work and the agricultural production front, as well as rectification and criticism of right-leaning thought, all of which have created reliable conditions for this year's great leap forward in agriculture.

The bumper harvest examples in many areas prove that the potential for agricultural production increase in our province is very large. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu in 22 townships in the suburbs of Xining City reached 315 jin, an increase of 56.72 percent compared to the average yield per mu in the early days of liberation in 1949. At present, out of the city's 22,499 farming households, 12,998 have reached or exceeded the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants, and 6,783 are at the level of general middle peasants. Xining City has now decided that in the next three years, all agricultural cooperatives in the city will exceed the production level of well-to-do middle peasants, and the grain yield per mu will reach 416 jin. In other areas, there have already been high-yield examples of 825 jin of highland barley per mu, 1,482 jin of wheat per mu, and 11,242 jin of potatoes per mu, which have greatly encouraged people of all ethnic groups. In the future, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai will surely make more and greater glorious achievements on the agricultural production front. We should actively strive to build our motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

　　有七个民族的青海省  99％农户加入合作社
    马兴泰代表介绍青海农业合作化后努力增产的新气象
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告，薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，以及吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告，并且在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我就青海省的农业发展情况作一发言，不妥之处请提出批评指正。青海境内有汉、藏、回、蒙古、土、撒拉、哈萨克七个民族，在这样一个多民族地区，由于党和政府正确贯彻了中央关于农业合作运动的方针、政策和各项措施，同全国各地一样在我们青海省取得了巨大成绩。截至现在，农业区已有百分之九十九的农户加入了农业生产合作社；全省已有农业社二千五百九十九个，其中由两个以上民族组成的民族联合社就有一千四百二十个。经过两年多的生产锻炼和多次的整顿，特别是经过农村社会主义大辩论和普遍讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），这些农业社不但更加巩固，而且大大地显示了无比的优越性。综合起来，主要有：
    社员的积极性大大提高  绝大多数社增加了生产
    一、由于农业合作化运动的胜利，大大提高了社员的生产积极性，绝大多数社增加了产量，增加了社员收入，减轻了自然灾害。在一九五七年，我省农业区有近百万亩耕地虽然遭受了不同程度的旱、雹、洪等灾害，但是由于组织起来力量大，各族农民在党的领导下，开展了轰轰烈烈的生产抗旱运动，采取了大力兴修水利和其他种种有效措施，不但减轻了自然灾害，按全省计算还比一九五六年增产百分之四点六。在许多地区去年还出现了生动的丰产事例。如海南藏族自治州兴海县唐乃亥村前进社的一百三十八点四亩小麦，规划社的四十亩小麦，平均产量每亩都超过八百五十斤，前进社二十三点一亩大豆（蚕豆），平均产量每亩九百斤。全村一九五七年预计比一九五六年增产五十多万斤粮食，使百分之八十以上的社员都增加了收入。祁连县先进农业社，有四亩山旱地，每亩产量六百二十五斤，循化清水乡前进社、西宁市苏家河湾社、湟源曙光社亩产量现已平均达到四百斤以上。互助土族自治县一九五七年受到旱灾和雹灾双重威胁，全县有一半以上的播种面积受到一种或两种的自然灾害，减产程度达到百分之十至五十五，但是由于各族农民在党的坚强领导下，采取了各种积极措施，大大地减轻了灾害，使全县百分之六十五的农业社增加了产量，百分之十的社保持了前年的收入。全县去年粮食和油料作物预计比一九五六年增产百分之三点六。
    统一合理使用土地和劳动力  开展大规模的农业基本建设
    二、由于合作化，生产资料和生产资金特别是土地和劳力得到了统一合理的使用，从而有可能开展大规模的农业基本建设。在这方面最突出的是农田水利工作。一九五七年，全省发展灌溉面积二十万零五千亩的任务胜利完成了。青海省第一个五年计划发展灌溉面积的指标是五十七万二千亩，到一九五六年底已发展五十九万九千七百亩，提前一年并超额百分之四点八四，完成了五年计划：按一九五七年底计算，五年发展灌溉面积八十万四千八百亩，相当于原订五年计划的百分之一百四十点六八。五年来全省由于旱地变水地而增产的粮食达到三亿四千万斤。造林方面，第一个五年计划我省造林十八万五千三百八十五亩，而实际造了四十八万六千多亩。水土保持工作上，一九五六年和一九五七年，全省共控制了一千二百五十平方公里的水土流失。这些具体事例充分证明：只有在党的领导下实现了农业合作化，农村生产力才能得到彻底解放，并且给它开辟了广阔的发展前途，否则，要想在短时期内得到上述成绩是万万不可能的。
    堵塞走资本主义的岔道  避免了农村的阶级分化
    三、由于生产关系的根本改变，必须要走社会主义的光明道路，因之，堵塞了走资本主义的岔道，避免了农村的阶级分化。解放前，各族农民受着地主、富农的残酷压榨剥削，衣不蔽身，食不饱腹，而且债台高筑。如湟中县丛林农业社一个生产队五十九户，在解放前他们欠地主粮食五万六千一百斤，白洋五百七十二元，典卖土地四百一十一亩，每年向地主付息十四万六千九百七十斤粮食。解放后，经过土地改革运动，农民生活虽然有了一定的改善，但是在合作化以前，由于农村资本主义的根子还没有铲掉，所以阶级分化仍然不可避免。例如乐都县那能口四个村子一百二十二户，一九五三年（土地改革后）做投机生意（捣贩牲畜）的有十八户，土地卖买和牲口出卖现象很严重，四个村买入土地的有二十户，共买土地一百五十六亩，卖地的十四户，卖出土地八十六亩。一九五一年土改时，有三十二户贫雇农分得骡子十一头、马三匹、驴四头，到一九五三年底，有十八户把九头骡子、三匹马、四头驴、五头牛全部卖光。这些阶级分化的事实在合作化以后，就完全没有了。因此，农民们都说：“若不是合作化，又会和土改以前一样少数人发财，多数人受穷哩”。
    改变生产所有制巩固了民族团结  民族关系变成社会主义民族关系
    四、随着生产所有制的改变，更加巩固了民族团结，使民族关系变成社会主义的民族关系了。表现在民族联合办社，各族农民不仅在政治上和经济上的利益完全一致，而且经过共同劳动，互相接近，互相了解，在生活上也消除了过去的民族隔阂，建立了互助友爱、互相尊重、互相学习的亲密关系，因之更能够齐心努力发展生产。如民和县官亭农业社有六个民族，团结得像一家人一样。在合作化高潮中，土族女社员给回族女社员耐心的教给拔草等农业生产技术，在婚丧事情和逢年过节时，各族社员互相帮助，互相关照。这样的事例是很多的。
    除了上述四个主要方面以外，农业合作化的优越性，还表现在大力改进农业生产技术、开展多种经营、支援工业和城市建设和安置移民等项工作上，由于农业合作化的巩固发展，所取得的成就是空前的。
    全省开展兴修水利和积肥运动  掀起规模巨大的农业生产高潮
    一九五八年我省将要开展一个规模巨大的农业生产高潮，使粮食总产量在一九五七年十二亿八千万斤的基础上增长百分之二十一点八，达到十五亿六千万斤，增产粮食二亿八千万斤。为了给一九五八年农业大生产做好准备，自去年十月开始，在本省范围内掀起了一个大规模的兴修水利和积肥运动。截至今年元月二十日，全省兴修水利计划已达一百零一万四千四百八十五亩，完工的工程可扩大灌溉面积二十万亩，正在动工兴建的水利工程，还可扩灌五十三万三千四百四十七亩。一九五八年全省计划增施肥料百分之二十五至三十。由于在许多地区逐步克服了右倾保守思想，重新修订了原来的增肥计划，提高一九五八年的增肥指标。如西宁市、大通县计划比一九五七年增肥百分之七十，化隆回族自治县增加百分之四十二，循化等地增加百分之三十以上。目前全省约有百分之十左右的农业社已基本上完成积肥计划，三分之二的社已完成积肥计划的百分之八十左右。积肥和兴修水利运动已在青海各个角落形成了高潮。对完成一九五八年的农业大生产任务，全省各族人民都有着坚强的意志和坚定的信心。我们一定胜利的条件是：首先我们有党的正确领导，经过农村社会主义大辩论和全国农业发展纲要的学习，有力地打击了不法地主、富农分子和其他坏分子的破坏活动，批判了资本主义思想，坚定了各族人民走社会主义道路的决心，劳动热情大大提高了。同时，大批的下放干部加强了基层工作和农业生产战线，以及整改、批判右倾思想等，都为今年农业大跃进创造了可靠的条件。
    许多地区的丰产事例证明，我省农业增产潜力是很大的。西宁市郊区二十二个乡，一九五七年粮食亩产量平均已达到三百一十五斤，比一九四九年解放初期平均每亩产量增加了百分之五十六点七二。目前全市二万二千四百九十九户农户中，已达到或超过富裕中农生活水平的有一万二千九百九十八户，相当于一般中农水平的有六千七百八十三户。西宁市现已决定在今后三年内，使全市农业社都超过富裕中农的生产水平，粮食亩产量达到四百一十六斤。在其他地区，已经出现了青稞亩产八百二十五斤，小麦亩产一千四百八十二斤，洋芋亩产一万一千二百四十二斤的高额丰产的事例，给各族人民以很大鼓舞。今后青海各族人民在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，在农业生产战线上一定会作出更多更大的辉煌成绩来。应该积极努力，争取把我们祖国早日建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富强的社会主义国家。
