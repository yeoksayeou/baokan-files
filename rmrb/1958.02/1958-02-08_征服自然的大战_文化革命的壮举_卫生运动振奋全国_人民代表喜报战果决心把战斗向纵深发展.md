Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The unprecedented "Eliminate the Four Pests" movement is playing a great role in transforming customs and changing the country throughout the nation. In the general discussion of the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress held today, representatives called on the people of the whole country to push this movement to a new climax on the existing basis. Minister of Health Li Dequan, Governor of Gansu Province Deng Baoshan, and Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province Guan Wenwei all emphasized in their speeches today that the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests is a broad mass movement. To continue this movement in depth and achieve rapid results, it is necessary to resolutely overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking of leaders at all levels and earnestly rely on and mobilize the masses.

The Glorious Achievements of Two Months
    65 Million Rats and Sparrows Eliminated
    Li Dequan was the first to speak today. She said that the Party's call to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene is indeed a great call to transform customs and change the country. It is a great initiative, a great change, and a good thing that benefits the people and future generations. Now, a massive and unprecedented high tide of movement has been set off in vast areas of the country. In just two months, more than 40 million rats and 25 million sparrows have been eliminated nationwide, and a large number of overwintering mosquitoes and flies have been eliminated. More than 4,600 cities, counties, districts, townships, towns, communities, streets, enterprises, schools, and institutions with "zero to four-free" status have emerged.

    Li Dequan also mentioned that because leaders in many places personally took charge and set an example, and the masses were fully mobilized, the movement immediately took on a new situation. 98% of households in Beijing's urban area have achieved "no flies," more than 90% of counties and cities in Jiangsu Province have taken action, and 8 million people in Anhui have joined the battle. She called on leading organs at all levels, especially health organs, to continue to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and guide the people of the whole country to carry out the "Eliminate the Four Pests" movement to the end. She hoped that in 1958, each province would have at least one to several "four-free" counties or cities, and that special districts, counties, districts, townships, communities, and street offices below the provincial level would create more "four-free" units.

    Representative Deng Baoshan said in a written statement that more than 90% of the counties and cities in Gansu Province have already taken action in the "Eliminate the Four Pests" movement. More than 4.1 million people in the province have participated in the movement. The broad masses have also included bedbugs, lice, and sandflies as pests that must be eliminated. They said, "We will not rest until we eliminate the seven pests." Wushan County has already had 110 "four-free villages" and will increase to 300 this spring. In the past, the Nanshan area of Wushan County, which has always been known as "excrement-eating pigs drink urine until it dries, dust filling the sky," now has 33 villages whose environmental sanitation has reached the "four-free" standard. Men, women, old and young in each village are full of energy, love labor, love life, and are full of a new atmosphere. Deng Baoshan said that because the broad masses have been fully mobilized, the superstitious ideas and habitual forces that have been passed down for thousands of years, such as "illness is a natural disaster, all depending on one's luck in life" and "dirtiness doesn't cause illness," have now begun to be broken through by the great "Eliminate the Four Pests" movement.

    Deng Baoshan reported to the conference that Gansu Province has set a goal of becoming a "seven-free" province within five years.

Schistosomiasis: The "Cannot Be Eliminated" Theory Can Be Retired
    Representative Guan Wenwei said in a written statement that because leaders at all levels in Jiangsu Province had serious right-leaning conservative thinking in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in the past, some cadres once did not believe that schistosomiasis could be eliminated, or thought that even if it was eliminated, it would take one or two hundred years. Therefore, in the two years since 1956, although the province's schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work has achieved certain results, progress has been slow. Guan Wenwei said that due to the leadership's attention, Chenbei Township in Qingpu County, Liuan Township in Gaoyou County, and Xiaohu Township in Jiangdu County, where schistosomiasis was seriously prevalent in the past, have fully mobilized the masses and carried out two years of struggle. Now, schistosomiasis has been completely eliminated, which is the most powerful refutation for those who hold the "cannot be eliminated" theory. After the whole people's rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, the leadership has overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and the enthusiasm of the masses has been mobilized. Schistosomiasis prevention and treatment work, like other tasks, is advancing at an unprecedented pace. He said that by eliminating snails on a large scale through the patriotic health movement and in conjunction with water conservancy construction, Jiangsu Province can now not only guarantee that flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows will be basically eliminated within four years, but also has full confidence and determination to completely eliminate schistosomiasis, which has plagued the people for thousands of years, before 1960.

Support Socialism from the Heart; Support Socialism with Action
    "Representatives of ethnic minorities should set a good example in socialist transformation," this is the firm statement made by Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Deputy Governor of Gansu Province, to the conference in his speech today. He said that a very small number of people with ulterior motives use "ethnic characteristics" as a guise to make an issue of it, attempting to obstruct socialist transformation and keep ethnic minorities in poverty and backwardness forever, which we cannot tolerate. We must make ourselves a true revolutionary progressive, so as not to disappoint the trust of the motherland and the people in us. He pointed out: We cannot just support socialism verbally, but must support it from the heart, support it with practical actions, and take the lead. He said that he decided to apply for the implementation of joint state-private ownership of his original pasture in Maqu County, and is also preparing to raise funds with everyone to build a hydropower plant in Xiahe County.

    Mamutiniyazi (Uyghur), Deputy Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League, pointed out in his speech the harm of local nationalism to the consolidation of the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups.

    He said that in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, although the number of local nationalists is not large, their harm is quite significant, because they are dressed in ethnic clothing and appear as so-called "defenders of ethnic interests," so they can still confuse and deceive some of the masses for a certain period of time. Especially among many ethnic minority cadres and intellectuals, there are still different degrees of local nationalist ideological tendencies. In the situation where ethnic estrangement left over from history has not been completely eliminated, the disguised reactionary activities of local nationalists are more likely to have an impact. He said that cadres and people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang firmly support the criticism of local nationalism. Since the second half of last year, after studying relevant documents, the political and ideological awareness of cadres of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has been greatly improved, and they have expressed their firm support for the central government's instructions and carried out the struggle to criticize local nationalism to the end.

    How the broad masses of intellectuals can actively transform themselves to serve socialism in the high tide of national production and construction is a question that representatives attach great importance to. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said when talking about this issue that politics is the commander and politics is the soul, but intellectuals often show a lack of knowledge on this fundamental issue. Facts have proved that if the political soul is lost, even if one has expertise, it is difficult to serve socialist construction well. He pointed out that the vast majority of intellectuals have drawn a line with rightists in the anti-rightist struggle and have begun to turn to the left, which is a good sign, but the issue of intellectual transformation cannot be said to have been resolved. Gao Chongmin said that the Democratic League organization is willing to guarantee to the people of the whole country that we must call on all members to actively participate in the rectification movement, fundamentally transform the political stance of the Democratic League organization and its members, help members and intellectuals connected by the Democratic League to make up their minds, put down the airs, sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and respectfully learn from workers and peasants, so as to transform ourselves into working intellectuals and make the Democratic League a political force that truly serves socialism.

Thrifty Housekeeping is a Common Task for All People
    Li Dongqing, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal Women's Federation, said that thrifty housekeeping is not only the responsibility of every housewife, but also a common task for all people. Whether the family is well managed directly affects the socialist enthusiasm of every member of the family. She said that in 1957, Wuhan commended and praised 9,634 "five-good" activists who were good at thrifty housekeeping, 102 "five-good" families, and 43 "five-good" collective units. In the fourth quarter of 1957, a city-wide "five-good" activist experience exchange commendation conference was held at the street, district, and municipal levels, and a city-wide thrifty housekeeping exhibition on saving food, cloth, coal, water, and electricity was also organized at the street, district, and municipal levels. Through commending and publicizing advanced figures and examples of thrifty housekeeping, the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses have been greatly enhanced. Everyone has been trying to find ways to save food, cloth, and coal. She said that thrifty housekeeping is not only beneficial to individuals and families, but also meets the needs of national socialist economic construction.

    Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yang Wengui, County Chief of the Damiao Mountain Miao Autonomous County in Guangxi Province, Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Tan Yubao, Deputy Governor of Hunan Province and Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, agricultural labor models Lu Hongbin, Yin Weichen, Zhang Huiying, Su Zichen, Deputy Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, Yan Renhai, Ye Cailin, Tao Dayou, industrial labor models from Hunan, Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Guowei, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Qiu Yuci, Deputy Director of the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Tan Zhen, Deputy Director of the First Navigation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Zeng San, Director of the National Archives Bureau, Wang Yunsheng, President of Dagong Newspaper, Zhang Junxiu, a football athlete, and other representatives spoke or made written statements at the meeting. A total of 26 representatives spoke and made written statements at today's meeting.

    In the speeches made at the conference in the past few days, the representatives all expressed their support for the reports made to the conference by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. The representatives expressed their support for the serious handling of the rightists among the national people's representatives at this conference.

    The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Guo Moruo, Tan Zheng, Chen Jiageng, Xie Fumin, Lu Hongbin, Cui Jiangong, Dapusheng, Yan Jici, and Huang Changshui.

    Today's meeting ended at 7:15 p.m. The conference will continue tomorrow morning.

　　征服自然的大战　文化革命的壮举
    卫生运动振奋全国
    人民代表喜报战果决心把战斗向纵深发展
    据新华社7日讯　史无前例的除四害运动正在全国范围内起着移风易俗、改造国家的伟大作用。在全国人民代表大会第五次会议今天举行的大会讨论中，代表们要求全国人民把这一运动在现有的基础上推向更新的高潮。卫生部长李德全、甘肃省省长邓宝珊、江苏省副省长管文蔚今天的发言都强调指出，以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动是一个广泛的群众性运动，要把这个运动继续深入开展下去并且迅速收效，必须坚决克服各级领导的右倾保守思想，认真依靠和发动群众。
　　两个月的辉煌战果
    消灭老鼠麻雀六千五百万
    李德全今天第一个发言。她说，党所提出来的除四害、讲卫生的号召确实是移风易俗、改造国家的伟大号召，它是伟大的创举，伟大的变革，它是造福人民和造福子孙万代的好事。现在，全国广大地区都已掀起声势浩大、规模空前的运动高潮。在短短的两个月内，全国已经消灭老鼠四千万只以上，捕雀二千五百万只，消灭大量越冬蚊蝇，涌现出一无到四无的市、县、区、乡、镇、社、街道、企业、学校和机关已有四千六百个以上。
    李德全还谈到，由于许多地方的领导人亲自挂帅，身体力行，群众得到充分发动，因而运动马上出现新的形势。北京城区有98％的住户做到了无蝇，江苏省90％以上的县市已行动起来，安徽有八百万人投入了战斗。她要求全国各级领导机关特别是卫生机关要继续克服右倾保守思想，引导全国人民把除四害运动进行到底。她希望在1958年内每省至少出现一个到几个四无县或市，省以下的专区、县、区、乡、社、街道办事处要创造出更多的四无单位。
    邓宝珊代表在书面发言中说，甘肃省有90％以上的县、市已经在除四害运动中行动起来，全省参加运动的有四百一十多万人，广大群众还把臭虫、虱子、白蛉子也列入必须消灭之列，他们说：“不除七害誓不休”。武山县已经出现一百一十个“四无村”，今年春季将增加到三百个。过去向来被称为“大粪猪吃尿自干，满地灰尘漫住天”的武山县南山地区，现在也有三十三个村子的环境卫生达到了“四无”标准，各村男女老幼人人精神饱满，热爱劳动，热爱生活，充满一片新气象。邓宝珊说，由于广大群众已充分发动起来，过去几千年流传下来的那种“病是三灾六难，全靠人的流年运气”，“不干不净，吃了没病”的迷信思想和习惯势力，现在已开始被伟大的除四害运动冲破了。
    邓宝珊向大会报告甘肃省已定下要在五年内成为“七无”省的奋斗目标。
　　血吸虫病　“不能消灭论”可以休矣
    管文蔚代表在书面发言中谈到，由于过去江苏省各级领导在防治血吸虫病上存在着严重的右倾保守思想，有些干部曾经不相信血吸虫病能够消灭，或者以为即使消灭也需要一、二百年的时间。因此，从1956年以来的两年多时间内，全省血吸虫病防治工作虽已取得一定成绩，但进度迟缓。管文蔚说，由于领导上重视，过去血吸虫病流行严重的青浦县城北乡、高邮县六安乡、江都县小湖乡，经过充分发动群众，进行了两年的搏斗，现在已全部消灭了血吸虫病，这一事实对于那些“不能消灭论”者是一个最有力的批驳。经过全民整风和反右派斗争，领导上克服了右倾保守思想，群众积极性已调动起来，血吸虫病防治工作也和其他各项工作一样以前所未有的步伐向前迈进。他说，通过爱国卫生运动和结合兴修水利来大规模地消灭钉螺，江苏省现在不但能保证在四年内把苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀基本上消灭，对于数千年来一直折磨着人民的血吸虫病，也有充分的信心和决心在1960年前把它全部消灭干净。
　　从心里拥护社会主义  用行动支持社会主义
    “少数民族的代表人士要在社会主义改造方面做出良好的榜样”，这是甘肃省副省长黄正清代表（藏族）在今天的发言中向大会所作的坚决表示。他说，有极少数别有用心的人，利用“民族特点”作为幌子，借题发挥，企图阻挠社会主义改造，使少数民族永远陷于贫困落后的境地，这是我们所不能容忍的。我们必须使自己成为一个名副其实的革命促进派，才不至于辜负祖国和人民对我们的信任。他指出：我们不能只是口头上拥护社会主义，要从心里来拥护，要用实际行动来支持，要起带头作用。他表示决定把他在玛曲县原有的一个牧场，申请实行公私合营，并且准备同大家集资建设夏河县水电厂。
    共青团新疆维吾尔自治区委员会副书记马木提尼牙孜代表（维吾尔族）在发言中，指出了地方民族主义对巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结的危害性。
　　他说，在新疆维吾尔自治区，地方民族主义者的人数虽然不多，但他们的危害性是相当大的，因为他们披着民族的外衣，以所谓“民族利益的维护者”的面目出现，所以在一定时间内，还能迷惑和欺骗一部分群众。特别是在许多少数民族干部和知识分子中，还程度不同地存在着地方民族主义思想倾向，在历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂还没有完全消除的情况下，地方民族主义者伪装起来的反动活动，就更容易发生影响。他说，新疆各族干部和各族人民对于批判地方民族主义是坚决拥护的。从去年下半年以来，新疆各民族干部经过学习有关文件，各民族干部的政治思想觉悟已经有了很大提高，纷纷表示坚决拥护中央的指示，把批判地方民族主义的斗争进行到底。
    广大知识分子在全国生产建设高潮中如何积极改造自己为社会主义服务，这是代表们十分重视的一个问题。中国民主同盟副主席高崇民代表在谈到这个问题时说，政治是统帅，政治是灵魂，知识分子在这个根本问题上却往往显出了无知识。事实证明，如果失去了政治灵魂，即使是学有专长，也难以很好地为社会主义建设服务。他指出，极大部分知识分子在反右派斗争中同右派分子划清了界线，开始向左转，这是一种好气象，但是知识分子改造问题，却决不能说已经解决了。高崇民说，民盟组织愿意向全国人民保证，我们一定要号召全体成员积极投入整风运动，根本改造民盟组织和盟员的政治立场，帮助盟员和民盟所联系的知识分子，立下决心，放下知识分子架子，诚心诚意地接受共产党的领导，恭恭敬敬地向工人、农民学习，以便把我们自己改造成为劳动知识分子，并使民盟真正成为为社会主义服务的政治力量。勤俭持家是全体人民共同的任务
    武汉市妇联副主任李冬青代表说，勤俭持家不仅是每个家庭主妇的责任，而且也是全体人民共同的任务。家庭管理得好不好，都直接影响着家庭里每个成员的社会主义积极性。她说，武汉市在1957年经过评选表扬了九千六百三十四个善于勤俭持家的“五好”积极分子，一百零二个“五好”家庭和四十三个“五好”集体单位。1957年第四季度召开了全市街、区、市三级“五好”积极分子经验交流表扬大会，同时还组织了全市街、区、市三级节约粮、布、煤、水电的勤俭持家展览会。经过表扬和宣传勤俭持家的先进人物和事例，大大发挥了群众的创造性和积极性，大家想办法找窍门，创造了许多节约用粮、用布、用煤的好办法。她说，勤俭持家不仅对个人、家庭有利，而且符合国家社会主义经济建设的需要。
    中国人民解放军新疆军区副司令员陶峙岳、广西省大苗山苗族自治县县长杨文贵、中共江西省委书记刘俊秀，湖南省副省长、中共湖南省委书记谭余保、农业劳动模范吕鸿宾、殷维臣、张惠英，陕西省农业厅副厅长苏资琛、来自湖南的工业劳动模范言仁海、叶财林、陶大有、中国科学院副院长陶孟和、全国总工会副主席刘长胜、政协湖北省委员会副主席李国伟、冶金工业部钢铁研究所副所长丘玉池、交通部航务第一工程局副局长谭真、国家档案局局长曾三、大公报社长王芸生、足球运动健将张俊秀等代表，分别在会上发言或作书面发言。在今天大会上发言和书面发言的代表共有二十六人。
    在几天的大会发言中，代表们都表示赞同李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长兼秘书长、吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。代表们表示拥护这次大会对全国人民代表中的右派分子的严肃处理。
    今天大会的执行主席是：郭沫若、谭政、陈嘉庚、谢扶民、吕鸿宾、崔建功、达浦生、严济慈、黄长水。
    今天的大会在下午七时十五分结束。大会明天上午将继续举行。
