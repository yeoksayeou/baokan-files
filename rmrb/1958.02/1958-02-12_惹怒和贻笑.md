    Annoying and Ridiculous

    On the eve of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting, Mr. Stone, the Far East director of the "International News Service," cried out for this aggressive bloc. He said, "In reality, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is either infuriating, or ridiculous or despised everywhere in the East."

    However, these widespread anger, ridicule, and contempt obviously did not make the American rulers any wiser. According to Stone, Dulles is preparing to find ways to strengthen the "liaison" between the group and the Chiang gang, South Korea, and Japan at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting next month. Stone bluntly revealed the truth: the United States did not allow the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group and the South Korean Syngman Rhee group to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the past in order to "attract neutralists," but "the result did not work." Therefore, the United States believes that now is the time to accept these "resolutely anti-communist" partners. From this, we can see the sorrow of the American overlord.

    However, what will be the result of this desperate American approach? It can only cause even greater anger, ridicule, and contempt from the people of Asian countries towards the already stinky Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    惹怒和贻笑
    在东南亚集团将要开会的前夕，“国际新闻社”远东分社社长斯通为这个侵略集团发出了哀鸣。他说：“实际上，东南亚条约组织在东方各处不是使人愤怒，就是嘲笑或轻视。”
    但是，这些普遍的愤怒、嘲笑和轻视显然并没有使得美国的统治者变得聪明一些。据斯通说，杜勒斯准备在下月举行的东南亚集团会议上设法加强这个集团同蒋帮、南朝鲜和日本之间的“联络”。斯通毫不隐讳地说穿了真实的情况：美国过去没有让台湾蒋介石集团和南朝鲜李承晚集团参加东南亚集团，是为了想“吸引中立主义者”，而“结果并未发生作用。”因此美国认为现在是接纳这些“坚决反共”的伙伴的时候了。从这里面可以看出美国盟主的悲哀。
    然而，美国的这种图穷匕见的做法会有什么样的结果呢？它只能使本来就够臭的东南亚集团引起亚洲各国人民更大的愤怒、嘲笑和轻视而已。
