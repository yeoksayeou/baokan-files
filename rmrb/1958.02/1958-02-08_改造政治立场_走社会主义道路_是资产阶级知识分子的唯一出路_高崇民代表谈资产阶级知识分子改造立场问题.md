Transforming Political Standpoints and Taking the Socialist Road: The Only Way Out for Bourgeois Intellectuals
Representative Gao Chongmin Discusses the Issue of Bourgeois Intellectuals' Transformation of Standpoints
The speeches of many worker and peasant representatives vividly depicted a heroic picture of 600 million people bravely advancing to build socialism. What a great impetus this picture has for our intellectuals! Under this exciting new situation, which path should we intellectuals, especially the majority of intellectuals who have not yet abandoned the bourgeois standpoint, take? Should we be determined to transform ourselves, strive to move forward, and advance with the revolution? Or should we cling to the old and lag behind, even becoming stumbling blocks to the times? Now is the time to make a choice.

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of the transformation of bourgeois intellectuals' standpoints.

Our meeting is filled with confidence and hope. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country and people are riding the wind and waves, leaping towards a great and radiant future. In the大会, the speeches of many worker and peasant representatives vividly depict a heroic picture of 600 million people bravely advancing to build socialism. What a great impetus this picture has for our intellectuals! Under this exciting new situation, which path should we intellectuals, especially the majority of intellectuals who have not yet abandoned the bourgeois standpoint, take? Should we be determined to transform ourselves, strive to move forward, and advance with the revolution? Or should we cling to the old and lag behind, even becoming stumbling blocks to the times? Now is the time to make a choice.

In the past year, the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory on the political and ideological fronts. The Party's call for nationwide rectification and the struggle against bourgeois rightists have greatly enhanced the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people throughout the country under socialist production relations, creating very favorable conditions for the forward leap of China's socialist cause. For us intellectuals, and for the democratic parties representing bourgeois intellectuals, the rectification and anti-rightist struggle have been a very profound socialist education. Through this movement, right and wrong have been clearly distinguished, and everyone's understanding and awareness have been improved. The rampant attacks of the rightists and the victory of the anti-rightist struggle have presented all democratic parties, all bourgeois elements, and bourgeois intellectuals with a fact: the Communist Party and socialism cannot be opposed. Transforming political standpoints, bowing to the working people, following the Communist Party, and taking the socialist road is the only way out.

The Vast Majority of Intellectuals Begin to Turn to the Left, But the Issue of Political Standpoint Has Not Yet Been Resolved

Now the anti-rightist struggle has achieved a basic victory. The vast majority of intellectuals have drawn a line between themselves and the rightists and have begun to turn to the left. This is a good sign. But has the issue of intellectuals' transformation been resolved? Not yet.

Judging from the situation of our democratic parties, after the rightists were defeated, some people thought that everything was fine and relaxed their efforts. Some said: "The rightists have been defeated, I am not a rightist, I don't need to transform myself anymore, or I have already transformed myself almost completely." Some said: "I have the ability, the Party and the government cannot do without me, it doesn't matter whether I transform myself or not." Some said: "We intellectuals join the trade union, which means we are workers, but joining a democratic party turns us into bourgeois intellectuals. I didn't know this in the past, and I mistakenly boarded a pirate ship. After the anti-rightist struggle ends, I will withdraw from the democratic party." There are also some more law-abiding people who say: "Now we must protect ourselves, bury ourselves in our work, and there will be no mistakes."

These situations show that a large part of our intellectuals have not yet abandoned their original bourgeois standpoint, have not yet truly stood on the side of the working people, and have not become laboring intellectuals. The rightists also took advantage of the weaknesses of our intellectuals to attack the Party and socialism. Luo Longji opposed the leadership of "proletarian petty intellectuals" over "petty bourgeois big intellectuals." Luo Longji and Fei Xiaotong both demanded "freedom in a small world and warmth in a big world" and advocated the doctrine of "one room, two books." In short, they wanted to lure intellectuals, first to disengage from politics, disengage from the working class and the Communist Party, and then fall into the mire of anti-communism and anti-socialism. Therefore, after the rightists are defeated, if intellectuals still hold their heads high, unwilling to change their standpoints, bow to the workers and peasants, and wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Communist Party, the future is very dangerous.

We Should Learn Respectfully from Workers and Peasants; Separating from the Leadership of the Working Class Will Achieve Nothing

Chairman Mao Zedong has taught us more than once that all knowledge comes from practice, from the working people. Intellectuals from the old society, apart from understanding some book knowledge divorced from reality, have nothing to boast about. Instead, they should respectfully learn from workers and peasants. The facts of the past eight years have also repeatedly taught us: the proletariat can not only lead intellectuals and lead science, culture, and education, but also lead them very well and very outstandingly. Conversely, if intellectuals separate themselves from the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, they will achieve nothing.

Politics is the Commander; Politics is the Soul - This is True for All Work and All People

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said in his report at this meeting: "Politics serves the economy, it is the guarantee of economic work, and at the same time it is the commander and soul of economic work and all other work." This sentence gives us great inspiration. Politics is the commander, politics is the soul, not only for economic work, but for all work and all people.

Our country is an economically and culturally backward country, and has always been called the "sick man of East Asia," but in the short span of eight years, we have made rapid progress and developed vigorously, and the national spirit has been greatly promoted. This is not a miracle, but due to the leadership of the Party, the leadership of Marxism-Leninism, and the superiority of the socialist system. After the change of production relations, why are our workers and peasants able to ride the wind and waves, carry out selfless labor, give full play to collective enthusiasm and creativity, and accomplish heroic undertakings that their predecessors dared not dream of? Doesn't this fully illustrate the huge driving force of politics and the socialist system?

Even If They Have Expertise and Are Willing to Serve Socialism, They Often Go in the Opposite Direction If They Lose Their Political Soul

Politics is the commander, politics is the soul. This is a great truth that every ordinary worker and peasant can understand. But we intellectuals often show ignorance on this fundamental issue. Many people think that they can ignore politics if they engage in professional work. Many people advocate being expert but not red, or expert first and red later. Many people still believe that the proletariat does not understand culture and is an amateur, and amateurs cannot lead experts. People with this kind of wrong thinking are not all rightists. But if the standpoint of bourgeois intellectuals is not changed, it is easy to move towards the edge of the rightists. Countless facts prove that all scientists, writers, artists, and educators, if they lose their political soul, even if they have expertise and are truly willing to serve socialist construction, the result is often the opposite.

It is not difficult for intellectuals to transform their standpoints, break the capitalist standpoint, and establish the socialist standpoint, as long as they are determined. And today's situation is very conducive to the transformation of intellectuals' standpoints. First, since 1956, China's social production relations have changed. Bourgeois intellectuals have lost their original economic foundation. There is no way out if they do not stand on the side of the working people. Second, the Party and the government give great concern to uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. Workers and peasants all demand close cooperation with intellectuals to build a great socialist motherland. Third, the Party and the government call on cadres to go to the mountains and the countryside to engage in labor training, which is a good opportunity for intellectuals to transform themselves. For the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist rightists, we must also strive to win over most of them, conduct self-transformation, start anew, and transform negative forces into positive forces. Shouldn't we bow to the workers and peasants and thoroughly transform our political standpoints, abandon the bourgeois standpoint, and firmly stand on the working class standpoint?

The China Democratic League Has Begun to Correct Its Political Direction and Is Undergoing Organizational Transformation and Standpoint Transformation

Now I would like to say a few words about the situation of the China Democratic League.

A year ago, the China Democratic League was usurped of its real leadership power by the Zhang-Luo Alliance and other rightists. When the national rightists used rectification to launch rampant attacks on the Party and socialism, the Zhang-Luo Alliance played a backbone role, and the China Democratic League also lost its political direction for a period of time, causing certain losses to the country and the people. Thanks to the timely counterattack by the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country against the bourgeois rightists, the China Democratic League also launched an anti-rightist struggle. In the past seven months, the rightists within the League have all fallen into isolation. The anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance has been thoroughly exposed and criticized, and the China Democratic League has begun to correct its political direction, and the awareness of the League members has been greatly improved. As Chairman Mao said, the anti-rightist struggle has turned bad things into good things.

Now the anti-rightist struggle within the China Democratic League has achieved a fundamental victory. Serious actions have been taken against the rightists in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. The rightists within the League across the country are also being dealt with. The Central Committee and local organizations of the China Democratic League are launching a general rectification campaign. We are willing to assure the people of the whole country: we will call on all members to actively participate in the rectification movement, fundamentally transform the organization of the China Democratic League, transform the political standpoints of the League members, and, more importantly, help the League members and the intellectuals associated with the China Democratic League to be determined to change their bureaucratic airs, put down the airs of intellectuals, sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party, respectfully learn from workers and peasants, and strive to transform ourselves into laboring intellectuals, and make the China Democratic League a political force that truly serves socialism.

　　改造政治立场　走社会主义道路  是资产阶级知识分子的唯一出路
    高崇民代表谈资产阶级知识分子改造立场问题
    许多工农代表的发言，用极其生动的事实，描绘出六亿人民为建设社会主义勇猛进军的一幅英雄画图。这幅画图对于我们知识分子队伍的推动力是多么大啊！在这种令人兴奋的新形势之下，我们知识分子，特别是至今还没有抛弃资产阶级立场的大部分知识分子，走哪一条路呢？还是抱定决心，改造自己，力争上游，随着革命前进呢？还是抱残守阙，落伍掉队，甚至成为时代的绊脚石呢？现在是到了必须选择的时候了。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告。
    我现在就资产阶级知识分子的立场改造问题提供一点意见。
    我们这次会议是充满了信心和希望的会议。我们的国家和人民，在中国共产党正确领导之下，正在乘风破浪，向着伟大的光芒万丈的前程跃进。在大会中许多工农代表的发言，用了极其生动的事实，为我们描绘出六亿人民为建设社会主义勇猛进军的一幅英雄画图。这幅画图对于我们知识分子队伍的推动力是多么大啊！在这种令人兴奋的新形势之下，我们知识分子，特别是至今还没有抛弃资产阶级立场的大部分知识分子，走哪一条路呢？还是抱定决心，改造自己，力争上游，随着革命前进呢？还是抱残守阙，落伍掉队，甚至成为时代的绊脚石呢？现在是到了必须选择的时候了。
    过去这一年，社会主义革命在政治战线、思想战线上取得了决定性的胜利。党号召的全民整风和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，大大提高了全国人民在社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性，为我国社会主义事业的向前跃进，创造了十分有利的条件。对我们知识分子，对代表资产阶级知识分子的民主党派来说，整风和反右派斗争，又是一次十分深刻的社会主义教育。通过这一次的运动，大是大非已经判明，大家的认识和觉悟都有所提高。右派分子的猖狂进攻和反右派斗争的胜利，向一切民主党派、一切资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，提出一个事实：共产党和社会主义是反不得的，改造政治立场，向劳动人民低头，跟着共产党，走社会主义道路，是唯一的出路。
    极大部分知识分子开始向左转  但是政治立场问题还没有解决
    现在反右派斗争已经取得了基本胜利。极大部分知识分子和右派分子划清界线，开始向左转。这是一种好气象。但是知识分子的改造问题是不是已经解决了呢？还不是。
    从我们民主党派的情况来看，把右派反掉以后，有些人以为已经万事大吉，有松劲思想。有人说：“右派已被反掉，我不是右派，用不着再改造了，或者已经改造得差不多了。”有人说：“我有本领，党和政府少不了我，改造不改造没关系。”有人说：“我们知识分子加入工会，就是工人阶级，加入民主党派反变成资产阶级的知识分子，过去不知道，误上了贼船，反右派斗争结束后，我就要退出民主党派。”还有一些比较守本分的说：“现在要明哲保身，埋头搞业务，就没有错。”
    这些情况说明了我们知识分子很大一部分人，还没有抛弃原来的资产阶级立场，还没有真正站到劳动人民这一边，成为劳动知识分子。右派分子也就是利用了我们知识分子的弱点，来向党向社会主义进攻。罗隆基反对“无产阶级小知识分子”领导“小资产阶级大知识分子”。罗隆基、费孝通都要求“小天地的自由，大天地的温暖”，并且鼓吹“一间房、两本书”主义。总之，他们要诱骗知识分子，首先脱离政治，脱离工人阶级、共产党，然后落入反共反社会主义的泥坑。因此，在反掉右派分子以后，知识分子仍然翘起尾巴，不愿改变立场、向工农低头、全心全意接受共产党领导，前途是十分危险的。
    应当恭恭敬敬向工人农民学习  脱离工人阶级领导将一事无成
    毛泽东主席不止一次地教导我们，一切知识都是从实践中来的，从劳动人民中间来的，从旧社会出身的知识分子，除了懂得一些脱离实际的书本知识以外，并没有什么可以夸耀的东西，倒是应当恭恭敬敬向工人、农民学习。八年来的事实也再三教训我们：无产阶级不但能够领导知识分子，领导科学文教事业，并且领导得很好，很出色。反之，知识分子脱离了工人阶级共产党的领导，就会一事无成。
    政治是统帅　政治是灵魂  对一切工作一切人都是如此
    李先念副总理在这次会议上所作的报告中说：“政治是为经济服务的，它是经济工作的保证，同时又是经济工作和其他一切工作的统帅和灵魂。”这句话给我们极大的启发。政治是统帅，政治是灵魂，不仅是经济工作，对一切工作，一切人来说都如此。
    我们的国家是一个经济落后、文化落后的国家，一向被称为“东亚病夫”，但在短短的八年中间，我们突飞猛进，蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展，民族精神大大地发扬了。这不是什么奇迹，这是由于党的领导，由于马克思列宁主义的领导，由于社会主义制度的优越性。我们的工人和农民，在生产关系改变之后，为什么能够乘风破浪，进行忘我的劳动，发挥集体的积极性、创造性，做出了前人所不敢梦想的英雄事业呢？这还不充分说明了政治和社会主义制度的巨大推动力吗？
    纵有专长愿意为社会主义服务  失去政治灵魂也往往背道而驰
    政治是统帅，政治是灵魂，这是每一个普通的工人、农民都能够明白的大道理。但是我们知识分子在这一个根本问题上，往往显出了无知无识。很多人以为自己搞专业，就可以不问政治了。很多人主张专而不红，或者先专后红。很多人仍然认为无产阶级不懂文化，是外行，外行不能领导内行。有这种错误思想的人，并不都是右派分子。但是资产阶级知识分子的立场不改变，就很容易走向右派的边缘。无数事实证明，一切科学家、文学家、艺术家和教育工作者，要是失去了政治的灵魂，即使是学有专长，并且真正愿意为社会主义建设服务，结果也往往背道而驰。
    知识分子改造立场，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，只要立下决心，并不是难事。并且今天的形势，十分有利于知识分子的立场改造。第一，一九五六年以来，我国社会生产关系已经改变，资产阶级知识分子失去原来的经济基础，不站在劳动人民这一边，就没有出路。第二，党和政府对于团结、教育、改造知识分子，予以极大的关怀，工人农民都要求和知识分子密切合作，以建设社会主义的伟大祖国。第三，党和政府号召干部上山下乡，进行劳动锻炼，是知识分子改造的良好机会。对于反共、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子，我们还要争取他们中间的大部分，进行自我改造，重新做人，化消极力量为积极力量。我们自己向工农低头，彻底改造自己的政治立场，抛弃资产阶级立场，站稳工人阶级立场，难道还不应该吗？
    民盟开始端正了政治方向  正进行组织改造和立场改造
    现在我就中国民主同盟的情况说几句话。
    在一年以前，民盟被章罗联盟和其他右派分子篡夺了领导实权，在全国右派分子利用整风向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，章罗联盟起了骨干作用，民盟也在一个时期迷失政治方向，对国家和人民造成一定的损失。由于全国工人、农民和革命知识分子向资产阶级右派分子进行了及时的反击，民盟内部也展开了反右派斗争，七个月以来，盟内右派分子已全部陷于孤立，章罗联盟的反共反社会主义阴谋，受到彻底的揭发和批判，民盟开始端正了政治方向，盟员的觉悟大大提高。正如毛主席所说，反右派斗争使坏事变成了好事。
    现在民盟内部反右派斗争已经取得了根本胜利。对于在民盟中央的右派分子，已进行了严肃的处理。对于全国各地的盟内右派分子也正在处理中。民盟中央和地方组织，正在展开一般的整风。我们愿意向全国人民保证：我们要号召全体成员，积极投入整风运动，根本改造民盟的组织，改造盟员的政治立场，更重要的是帮助盟员和民盟所联系的知识分子，立下决心，改掉官气，放下知识分子架子，诚心诚意接受共产党领导，恭恭敬敬向工人农民学习，我们每个人要努力把自己改造成为劳动知识分子，并且使民盟成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。
