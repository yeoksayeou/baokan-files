Don't Forget Coordination in the Great Leap Forward in Production
Representative Wang Xuncai proposed three suggestions: First, the alteration of railway routes and the expansion of bridges for water conservancy construction should be carefully planned well in advance to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another. Second, the material allocation departments could convert steel materials intended for window frames and the like into structural steel for allocation to railway departments to build steel beam bridges to save land. Third, it is best to annotate Chinese characters phonetically on a character-by-character basis and not rush into phonetic spelling of phrases.

I listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1958," and Director Wu Yuzhang's "Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," and carefully read and studied the printed versions of each report. I found the content of these reports to be clear, correct, and without any need for modification or supplementation, so I respectfully request that the Congress approve them. I would like to take this opportunity to offer the following three opinions for the reference of relevant parties:

(1) In recent years, provinces have often had to dig new river channels or expand existing ones to prevent flooding and drain waterlogged areas through the construction of water conservancy projects. If these new and old river channels need to cross railway lines, the roadbed must be removed, new bridges built, or existing bridges extended. In this type of construction, the problem often arises that the water conservancy side is eager for quick results and does not take into account the proper arrangements for the railway side. For example, suppose a certain basin experienced a flood that occurs once every twenty years during the rainy season of 1951. The water conservancy side would immediately request approval to dig river channels and build related railway bridges, but regardless of the size or difficulty of the project, the railway side would always be required to complete the project entirely before the next flood season, as if a similar flood would occur again in the rainy season of 1952. Of course, it is not impossible for a major flood that occurs once every twenty years, or even a larger flood, to occur for two consecutive years. In other words, such a flood that occurs twice in forty years could happen in two adjacent years, but the chance of this happening is very slim. According to the law of probability, if a flood that occurs once every twenty years occurred in 1951, the chance of another similar flood occurring one year later in 1952 is only one in four hundred (the chance of a similar flood occurring thirty-nine years later is also one in four hundred). If it were to occur two years later in 1953, the chance would be two in four hundred. That is to say, the chance of two floods that occur once every twenty years occurring within two years is three in four hundred (one in four hundred plus two in four hundred). Furthermore, the chance of two floods that occur once every twenty years occurring within three years is six in four hundred (one in four hundred plus two in four hundred plus three in four hundred). Furthermore, the chance of two floods that occur once every thirty years occurring within three years is six in nine hundred. The chance of two floods that occur once every fifty years occurring within three years is six in two thousand five hundred. As the saying goes, when faced with two evils, choose the lesser; when faced with two benefits, choose the greater. When weighing the pros and cons, it can be asserted that it is better to allow the railway side sufficient time to study, design, and plan properly than for the water conservancy side to seek rapid completion alone in order to seize the slim chance of being able to use it earlier. Wait until the coordinated work of both parties can be planned and then acted upon, so as to avoid the risk of losing sight of one thing while attending to another. In short, flood prevention, drainage, water conservancy construction, route changes, and bridge expansions are all related to century-long plans and the eternal undertakings of future generations. They must not be rushed or hastily repaired, lest the resulting projects violate economic principles and are not worthy of being passed down to future generations.

(2) As everyone knows, the most important and most commonly used materials in capital construction are steel, wood, and cement. Vice Premier Bo pointed out in his report that the output of these three materials will increase in 1958, especially the most valuable steel, with this year's planned output of 6,248,000 tons, an increase of 19.2% over last year. Especially for those of us engaged in railway engineering, listening to this news is truly encouraging. Although the output of steel has increased, it can be said with certainty that it is still far from meeting our construction needs. Therefore, in the near future, it will still be necessary, as in the past, to save steel as much as possible at all times and in all places, or to replace steel with other materials. For example, the use of masonry arch bridges or reinforced concrete beams for small and medium-span bridges is one example among many. Others say that it is not necessary to raise the roadbed or occupy more land when building masonry arch bridges or concrete beams across deep gullies, but this is not the case in plain areas. Assuming that a railway is built in a plain area, the higher the beam, the higher the roadbed must be raised. For a concrete beam with a span of more than ten meters, the roadbed must be raised by more than one meter compared to building an underslung steel beam bridge (where the road surface on which the rails are laid is connected to the lowest part of the bridge, hence the name underslung). Raising the roadbed not only requires more land for the roadbed itself, but also requires more land to be purchased to fill the increased height and the associated widening of the earthwork. It is roughly estimated that saving one ton of steel requires the loss of two to three mu of fertile land. Sacrificing fertile land to save and reduce the use of valuable steel cannot be said to be incorrect. But looking back, many of the newly built high-rise buildings in cities use steel for window frames. It seems that these buildings built with brick and concrete do not need steel windows in terms of fire protection or lighting. Furthermore, steel is easy to conduct heat, so steel windows are not as good as wooden windows for keeping cool in summer and warm in winter. Therefore, I suggest that the departments in charge of allocating materials consider converting the steel materials intended for window frames and the like into structural steel as much as possible and allocating them to railway departments so that they can produce more suitable steel beams to save the most valuable plain areas of our country.

(3) Regarding the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, the State Council has announced the scheme for phonetic annotation of Chinese characters to help literacy and unify pronunciation. I fully support this. However, since it is phonetic annotation for characters, there is no need to rush into phonetic spelling of phrases. That is to say, the characters within each phrase should be required to be annotated on a character-by-character basis, not jointly. Joint spelling can easily lead to misunderstandings. For example, the two characters "济南" (Jinan) are easily read as Jinan when annotated separately as JI—NAN, but if they are jointly spelled as JINAN, they are easily read as words like 近岸 (jinan, near shore), 金安 (jin'an, Jin'an), 津安 (jin'an, Jin'an), etc. Similarly, the two characters 天津 (Tianjin) are also easily read as 梯岸津 (ti an jin) if they are jointly spelled as TIANJIN, and so on.

Secondly, the "rhyme tail" character should also be spelled separately even if it is one character. For example, "花儿" (huar, flower) should still be spelled separately as Hua Er, not Huar. This is because the rhyme tail sometimes needs to be read for the same length of time as the preceding main character, and sometimes even longer. Here are a few examples: such as the phrases "云儿飘在海空，鱼儿藏在水中" (yún ér piāo zài hǎi kōng, yú ér cáng zài shuǐ zhōng, clouds float in the sky, fish hide in the water) and "月满兔儿肥" (yuè mǎn tù ér féi, the moon is full and the rabbit is fat). Furthermore, using the Latin alphabet to annotate Chinese characters is the best way to help literacy and unify pronunciation. If it is also used to spell words, or to combine the rhyme tail, I am afraid that it will be misunderstood and our Mandarin will become foreign-sounding.

I would be grateful for any criticisms or corrections of the above.

    生产跃进不要忘了呼应配合
    王洵才代表提出三点建议：一、为兴修水利而改动铁路路线扩建桥梁，应有相当时间妥善筹划，以免顾此失彼；二、分配物资部门可将拟制窗框等类之钢料改制结构钢材拨予铁路部门，建筑钢梁桥以节约土地；三、汉字注音最好按字分注，不必急于进行拼辞。
    我听了李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”，薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”，以及吴玉章主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，并将各报告的印发本加以详读研究。我对这些报告的内容均觉得明晰正确，莫有需要修改与补充之处，所以敬请大会予以通过。我拟趁此机会提出下列三个意见以备有关方面之参考：
    （一）近数年来各省为防涝排洪兴修水利工程，常须开挖新河道或扩大旧有的河道，若这些新旧河道须穿过铁路线时，则须挖去路基，修筑新桥，或延长旧有的桥梁。在这一类工事中，常常发生水利方面急于求成而不顾铁路方面妥善安排之问题。比方说，假定在一九五一年雨季期内某某流域曾发生过二十年一遇之灾洪，水利方面随即请准开挖河道与兴建有关的铁路桥梁，但是不管工程之大小，施工之难易，总是要求铁路方面必须于次年汛期以前完全竣工，好像是一九五二年雨季准又有同样灾洪之来临。当然，一连两年均发生二十年一遇之大洪水，或更大之洪水，不是不可能之事。换言之，四十年两遇之这样的洪水，可能相连发生于相邻之两年，不过这样的机会是微乎其微。按或然机会律推算之，若一九五一年发生过二十年一遇之洪水，则相距一年的一九五二年又发同样的洪水，其机会数只有四百分之一（相距三十九年才发同样的洪水亦是四百分之一的机会）。若是相距二年的一九五三年发生的话，其机会数是四百分之二。这就是说，在两年以内发生两次二十年一遇之洪水是四百分之三（四百分之一加四百分之二）的机会。推而言之，在三年以内发生两次二十年一遇的洪水是四百分之六（四百分之一加四百分之二加四百分之三）的机会。再推而言之，在三年以内发生两次三十年一遇的洪水是九百分之六的机会。在三年以内发生两次五十年一遇的洪水是二千五百分之六的机会。俗语云：两害相权取其轻，两利相权取其重。利害相权，得失相比，可以断言与其水利方面单独图快速成以争取微乎其微的能以提早使用之机会，似不如允许铁路方面有相当时间研究设计妥善筹划。俟两方面配合的工作均得以谋定而后动，以免有顾此失彼之虞。总而言之，防涝排洪兴修水利与改动路线扩建桥梁，均是有关百年大计，子子孙孙万世之业，决不可草率赶工抢修，以防万一有作出来违犯经济原则不足垂训后代之工程也。
    （二）如人所共知的在基本建设中最重要的材料而且最常用的材料是钢材、木材与水泥三种材料。薄副总理在其报告中指出这三项材料在一九五八年均增加产量，尤其是最宝贵的钢料一项，今年的产量拟定为六百二十四万八千吨，比去年增长百分之十九点二。特别是像我这样从事铁路工程工作者，聆读之下，不禁欢欣鼓舞。虽然钢料的产量有所增加，但是可以肯定地说，仍是远远不足我们建设的需要。因此在不久的将来，还是与以往一样的须随时随地的尽量节约钢材，或以他种料代替钢料。譬如中小跨度之桥梁，采用圬工拱桥或钢筋混凝土梁即是许多例中之一例。抑又有言者，凡跨越深沟幽谷之处，无论是建筑圬工拱桥或混凝土梁尚不需要加高路基和多占土地，而于平原地区则不然。假定在平原地区修建铁路，梁身一高，路基须随之提高。以十余公尺长的跨度混凝土梁而言，比之修建下承钢梁桥（桥上铺轨的路面连接桥之最下部，故称下承），须提高路基一公尺还零数公寸。路基加高，则不但路基本身须多占地面，且须多购土地以填筑增高及其连带加宽之土方。约略估计之，要节约一吨钢材，须多用二、三亩之肥沃土地。为节约与少用宝贵之钢料而忍痛损失肥沃之土地，不能说是不正确的。但是再回头看看，城市内新建的高楼大厦有很多用钢材做窗框，像这些以砖石与混凝土修建的楼厦无论是消防方面或采光方面，似均不需用钢窗。再者钢性易于传热，所以夏季保凉冬季保温，钢窗则不如木窗之为优。因此我建议主管分配物资的部门，可否考虑将拟制窗框等类之钢料尽量改制结构钢材分拨予铁路部门，使其能多制适当的钢梁，以节约我们国家所最宝贵的平原地区的土地。
    （三）关于汉语拼音方案的草案，国务院曾公布该方案为汉字注音以帮助识字和统一读音。我是十分拥护的。但是既系为字注音，则不必急于进行拼辞。这就是说将每一辞内的字似应规定是按字分注，不要联合拼注。联拼则易发生误解，例如“济南”二字分注为JI—NAN则很容易读出为济南，若联拼为JINAN，则易读成近岸，金安，津安（JINAN）等词。又如天津（TIAN JIN）二字，若联拼为TIANJIN则亦易读为梯岸津（TI AN JIN），诸如此类情况不一而足。
    其次，“韵尾”的字既是一个字，亦应该分拼。例如“花儿”仍应分拼作Hua Er，不应合拼为Huar。盖韵尾有时须与前面的主体字读一样长的时间，且有时须读的更长。谨举下面数个例子：如“云儿飘在海空，鱼儿藏在水中”、“月满兔儿肥”等词句。再者以拉丁字母为汉字注音是帮助识字、统一读音最好的办法，若再用来拼词，或者合拼韵尾，还恐被误会将我们的普通话变成外国腔调化了。
    以上所陈，凡有不当之处，敬请批评指正为感。
