Central Mass Art Museum Severely Detached from the Masses

This newspaper reports: The Central Mass Art Museum was established less than two years ago, but it has not done much work while its extravagance and waste are very serious. The original task of the Mass Art Museum was to engage in research and guidance of mass art. Due to extravagance and waste hindering the earnest implementation of the guidelines and tasks, the work has suffered great losses.

With only twenty-eight people, the Central Mass Art Museum's tendency to spread out and put on airs has reached an intolerable level. The museum's dance group, with only three people, has a newly built dance studio, spent more than 1,680 yuan on three high-grade carpets, spent 363.46 yuan on three large mirrors, spent 1,300 yuan on a piano specifically for dance practice (the music group already has a piano), and spent more than 90 yuan on three pairs of leather shoes and three pairs of dance shoes. In order to spend money quickly, they also purchased a stopwatch (160 yuan) that had nothing to do with their work. The music group and art group are even more egregious. The music group, also with three people, spent 1,000 yuan to buy an accordion to review a manuscript about playing the accordion. This accordion was only used once after it was bought and then put away. Even more absurdly, they bought 959 records, most of which were Western songs (some of which were jazz music). The art group has only one person, but instead of studying mass art activities, he purchased a large number of imported oil paints, as well as a large number of plaster casts and a complete set of sculpting tools for personal practice. The museum, despite not having anyone familiar with photography, also spent four to five thousand yuan to buy two cameras, photographic equipment, and darkroom equipment. Under the pretext of "learning," they used public materials to take and develop a large number of private photos.

What's even more serious is that when checking for waste, some people even thought this was not a big deal. Someone from the dance group said: "Doing dance work cannot be separated from specific artistic practice; if you encounter Mongolian dance, these leather shoes are still necessary." Someone from the art group said: "Cadres should be cultivated, and their professional level should be gradually improved in their work to ensure the quality of work, so it is necessary for the art group to buy plaster casts and oil paints." After these opinions were put forward, everyone began a debate. It was unanimously agreed that the Mass Art Museum is for mass art work, not a performing group. It does not directly satisfy the people's artistic requirements through its own artistic practice, but guides the artistic practice of the masses through research and guidance. Therefore, its nature of work determines that its work content is research work and organizational work. The art museum may conduct business research and guidance on Mongolian dance and accordion activities, but it definitely does not rely on a few people here to dance Mongolian dance or play the accordion. Therefore, purchasing things like an art performance group is wasteful. At the same time, it is believed that the Mass Art Museum is a working institution, not a learning institution, and all equipment should be based on the needs of the work. The art group does not base its work on the needs of the masses, does not engage in or study mass art activities, only emphasizes personal oil painting practice, and the plaster casts, oil paints, and cameras purchased under the pretext of "learning" are all wasteful.

After the debate, everyone unanimously believed that the reason for the waste was the leadership's serious bureaucracy, showing off, putting on airs, and spending money extravagantly, which was the main root cause of the waste. Secondly, the staff has individualistic thoughts and always wants to use legitimate conditions to achieve personal goals, regardless of national and people's interests. A waste exhibition was recently held to further educate everyone.

### 耍阔气　摆排场　铺摊子  中央群众艺术馆严重脱离群众

　　耍阔气　摆排场　铺摊子
    中央群众艺术馆严重脱离群众
    本报讯　中央群众艺术馆设立不到两年，工作做的不多，铺张浪费却十分严重。群众艺术馆原定任务是搞群众艺术的研究与指导工作的。由于铺张浪费妨碍了方针任务的认真贯彻执行，给工作带来了莫大损失。
    中央群众艺术馆只有二十八个人，他们铺摊子、讲排场已经到了不能容忍的地步。馆里的舞蹈组仅仅三个人，就有一个新建的练舞厅，又花了一千六百八十多元买了三块高级地毯，又花三百六十三元四角六分买了三面大镜子，又花一千三百元买了一架专供练舞的钢琴（音乐组已有一架钢琴），又花九十多元买了三双皮鞋和三双练舞鞋。为了突击花钱，还购了一个与工作毫无关系的秒表（一百六十元）。严重的还有音乐组、美术组。音乐组也是三个人，他们为审查一个关于演奏手风琴的稿子，花了一千元买了一架手风琴，这架手风琴买来只用过一次就休息了。更荒唐的是买了九百五十九张唱片，其中绝大部分是西洋歌曲（一部分是爵士音乐）。美术组只有一个人，他不研究群众美术活动，却购置大批进口油画颜料，还有大批石膏及整套的雕塑工具，作为个人练习之用。馆里没有熟悉摄影工作的，也花了四、五千元买了两架照像机和照像器材及暗房设备。借口“学习”，用公家材料大量拍摄和冲洗私人照片。
    严重的还在于检查浪费时，竟还有人认为这不算什么浪费。舞蹈组有人说：“搞舞蹈，总离不开具体的艺术实践；如遇到蒙古舞，这皮鞋还是必要的。”美术组的人说：“对于干部要培养，在工作中逐步提高业务水平，才能保证提高工作质量，所以美术组买了石膏、油画颜料，都是必要的。”这些意见提出后，大家展开了辩论。一致认为群众艺术馆是做群众艺术工作的，不是表演团体，不是以自己的艺术实践直接满足人民的艺术要求，而是通过研究、指导工作，指导群众的艺术实践。因此，它的工作性质决定了它的工作内容是研究工作和组织工作。艺术馆可能对于蒙古舞及手风琴的活动要进行业务的研究和指导，但决不是靠这里几个人跳蒙古舞或演奏手风琴，因此，照艺术表演团体购置的东西便是浪费。同时认为群众艺术馆是工作机构不是学习机构，一切设备应从工作需要出发。美术组不根据群众要求，不搞也不研究群众美术活动，只强调个人练习油画，借口“学习”购置的石膏、油画颜料、照像机等都是浪费。
    经过辩论以后，大家一致认为形成浪费的原因是领导上严重官僚主义，耍阔气、摆官气，大手大脚，这是造成浪费的主要根源。其次工作人员有个人主义思想，总想利用合法条件达到个人的目的，不顾国家利益与人民利益。日前他们举行了一个浪费展览会，进一步教育了大家。
