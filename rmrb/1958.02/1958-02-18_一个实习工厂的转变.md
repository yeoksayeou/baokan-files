    Recently, the reporter visited the Tianjin University Mechanical Internship Factory. Stepping into the factory workshop, one immediately gets a feeling of emptiness and desolation. The entire factory has a workshop area of more than 5,000 square meters, but only two hundred machines are installed. Jeeps can pass freely on the wide workshop aisles. Many machine tools are tightly covered with thick machine covers, with a thick layer of dust on top. On the machine cover of a new Soviet-style boring machine, there was a big-character poster written by the workers, which read: "A boring machine, only for demonstration. The support of the elder brother (the Soviet Union), is here idle. Just for the students to watch for a quarter of an hour each; it cost 42,000 yuan." The big-character poster was covered with dust, indicating that its appeal had not yet worked. According to Guo Xiaopeng, a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the person in charge of the factory, the quality of this new boring machine exceeds the level of many state-owned factories in Tianjin. It has been here for four years, but it has not produced any specific products. We stopped in front of a vertical lathe, and Guo Xiaopeng told me that this kind of lathe is only available in one factory in the city, and many large state-owned factories come to the school to use this machine, but it is placed here and the school only uses it for ten days a year. In the machine tool laboratory, there are more than 40 machine tools, many of which are precision machine tools. Unfortunately, only six machine tools can be operated frequently, and the rest are only operated a few times a year. In the milling workshop, a hobbing machine only produced ten large gears in 1956 and only produced dozens of gears in 1957. Under normal circumstances, this hobbing machine can produce two gears per shift. A power saw that can saw two hundred pieces of material per hour is operated for less than one hour a day. A five-axis automatic lathe that can produce five thousand parts a day has only been running idly for students to see since it was bought in 1954. A friction press that can produce two thousand parts in eight hours is also idle all year round. Five universal grinders are only occasionally operated by students during internships. What is even more regrettable is that some machine tools have never been used since they were bought, and some have rusted. A large number of parts made by students during their internships are also piled up as scrap iron. According to Guo Xiaopeng, about 2,000 students come to the factory for internships every year, and the parts they produce are all thrown away.

    The Tianjin University Internship Factory was built in 1952 and was initially used exclusively for student internships. In 1956, in order to solve the problem of some instruments and equipment used by the school, a group of workers were recruited to use these equipment for production. Now, the factory has more than 100 machine tools, many of which are new. They not only exceed the level of joint state-private factories in the city, but some also exceed the level of state-owned factories. Among the more than 130 workers, there are more than 70 skilled workers with a grade of four or higher. Such an internship factory is not only first-class among universities in the country, but according to Soviet expert Dubinin, some workshops in this internship factory are one-half or even two-thirds larger than the workshops of the famous Bauman Higher Technical School in the Soviet Union. In the past two years, the factory has produced products worth a total of 250,000 yuan, of which more than 30,000 yuan of products were supplied to other places. The fineness gauges produced by the factory, which specialize in checking the fineness of ink and paint, are sold to paint factories, ink factories, and news organizations in many cities across the country. The electromagnetic switches produced by the factory are also welcomed by other places. The school has also done some work in studying how to tap the potential of the equipment. For example, by reducing the capacity of the workshop and reducing the number of students entering the workshop for internships by about 50%, the number of internship classes can be increased, which can double the utilization rate of the equipment and also ensure the quality of the internship. However, the utilization rate of machinery and equipment is still very low. The fifty lathes with the highest utilization rate are not as productive as half a shift in other factories. Half of the factory's expenses are still supplied by the state.

    The Department of Mechanical Engineering, the factory leaders, and some teachers who are responsible for leading this internship factory have not realized that such a low utilization rate is a serious waste. Although some workers and students expressed dissatisfaction with the backlog of machines, they have their own views. They believe that for the needs of teaching and scientific research, it is necessary to turn them on a few times for the students to take a look, and it is not a backlog or waste at all. Some teachers also believe that a university of engineering should have a decent internship factory, and everything must be big, good, and new. Some leaders proposed development plans that are even higher than the highest Soviet standards. As for whether these devices are used or not, they rarely consider it. Some individuals also believe that some equipment may not be needed now, but may be needed in the future, and cannot be considered a backlog. After the launch of this rectification movement, the school launched a high tide against waste. Many teachers, students, and staff made sharp criticisms of this waste phenomenon. In particular, many workers, although they do not understand teaching business, felt very heartbroken when they saw the waste of national materials and posted big-character posters criticizing it. Many people demanded that the phenomenon of wasting state property be overcome immediately, and suggested that the internship factory be changed into a production unit, accepting external orders, and striving to be self-sufficient.

    Will changing the internship factory into a production unit affect the quality of teaching? Some people initially worried about this issue. Professor Wang Shourong, deputy director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, believes that this worry is unnecessary. He said: As long as the internship and production are properly arranged, it will not only not affect the quality of teaching, but will also improve the quality of teaching and achieve the effect of combining theory and practice. Because doing so can strengthen students' sense of responsibility and train them in a strict work attitude. In the past, when they produced parts, they first considered that "they have to be returned to the furnace anyway," and their enthusiasm was naturally affected; now, when they make a product, they first consider that this is to support industrial and agricultural production, and they work more seriously. At the same time, doing so can also overcome the past situation where teaching was separated from production practice. In the past, internship factories mostly produced single pieces or repaired and assembled parts, while the content requirements of the teaching syllabus and teaching plan were relatively high, and the two were often not combined. Therefore, teachers and students went to first-class large factories far away for internships during the holidays. After being changed to a production unit, there will be mass production and the technical level will be relatively high, so teachers and students can intern at the school, and the teaching content can be closely combined with the internship, which will improve the quality of teaching.

    Some people also worried that if it is changed to a production unit, whether it can be self-sufficient and whether it can create more wealth? After the advanced deeds of the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School and the Beijing Aviation Institute were announced, many people no longer looked at it that way. As Guo Xiaopeng said: "People create tens of thousands of yuan of wealth a year, and our machinery and equipment are better than theirs, and we also have teachers and students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Why can't we do it!?" Guo Xiaopeng also calculated an account: Under the current equipment conditions, after tapping the potential, it is not difficult to create 700,000 yuan of wealth for the country every year.

    The serious situation of low equipment utilization rate in the Tianjin University Internship Factory has attracted the attention of the party and administrative leaders of the school. The school urgently responded to the call of the Party and the government, learned from the Beijing Aviation Institute, and decided to put the internship factory into production. Recently, the school has sent capable cadres to lead this internship factory. A plan has been initially formulated to determine that the internship factory will be changed to a production unit in the first half of the year. In addition to conducting teaching internships and manufacturing instruments and equipment needed by the school, it will also accept external orders to manufacture machines, instruments, or parts processing for other units. In order to implement the policy of ensuring that both teaching and production are not neglected, it has been preliminarily determined to change the machining workshop into two workshops for teaching and production. In the teaching workshop, a two-part internship system is implemented, with twelve internship classes scheduled every day. This will free up 40 machine tools from the original teaching equipment, which will be used exclusively for production. In the teaching workshop, production will also be carried out in addition to the internship. The production workshop will accept external orders for mass production. Skilled workers will be used to make qualified workpieces, and faculty, staff, and students can be recruited to participate in labor. Now the factory workers are full of energy, and the teachers and students also welcome the change of the internship factory to a production unit. The factory leaders are contacting Tianjin's enterprises to place orders, and the workers are also actively preparing to adjust the factory buildings and machinery. They are full of confidence in accelerating their work to achieve the goal of reaching a production value of more than 2.5 million yuan and accumulating more than 1.3 million yuan for the country in a few years.

    When I finished my visit to Tianjin University, the sun had already set, and the traffic on Weijin Road was still heavy. Cars carrying building materials, raw materials, and various products sped by, and farmers' carts carrying fertilizers were also in an endless stream. The workers who had just finished work were even more energetic, and there was an inspiring scene everywhere. May the desolate internship factory of Tianjin University catch up with the current rapid development, accelerate its pace to catch up with the Beijing Aviation Institute and the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School, and participate in the great leap forward!

    一个实习工厂的转变
    新华社记者　石坚
    最近，记者访问了天津大学机械实习工厂。走进这个工厂的车间，就给人以空旷、冷落的感觉。全厂拥有面积共达五千多平方公尺厂房，只安装了二百多台机器。宽广的车间走道上吉普车都可以通行自如。许多机床被厚厚的机器罩严密地复盖着，上面的积尘已经很厚。在一台苏联新式镗床的机器罩上，贴着工人们写的一张大字报，上面写着：“镗床一个，只为表演。老大哥的支援，到此处却在赋闲。就为同学每人看一刻钟；花了四万二千元。”大字报上已积满了灰尘，显然它的呼吁还没有起到作用。据这个工厂的负责人、机械系讲师郭晓鹏告诉我，这个新式镗床的质量，超过天津市许多国营工厂的水平，它放在这里已经四年，却没有生产过任何具体的产品。我们又走到一台立式车床前面停下来，郭晓鹏告诉我，这种车床，全市只有一个工厂有，许多国营大厂都来学校使用这台机器，但是它放在这里，学校每年使用不过十天。在机床实验室里，放着四十多台机床，其中许多都是精密的机床。可惜只有六台机床能经常开动，其余的一年不过开几次车。在铣工车间，一台滚床1956年只生产了十个大齿轮，1957年只生产了几十个齿轮。而这台滚床在正常情况下每班就可以生产两个齿轮。一架每小时可以锯二百件料的气锯，每天开动不到一个小时。一天可以生产五千个零件的五轴自动车床，从1954年买来以后，它的作用只是开空车给学生们看看。八小时出两千个零件的摩擦压力机，也是常年摆着不用。五台万能磨床，只是学生们实习时偶尔操作一会儿。更令人痛惜的是有的机床买来以后，还一直没有用过，有的已经生锈了。学生们在实习时制出的大批零件，也被当做废铁堆起来。据郭晓鹏说：每年约有二千名学生到工厂实习，他们生产的零件全被扔掉了。
    天津大学实习工厂在1952年兴建以后，起初是专为学生实习用的。到了1956年，为了解决本校用的一部分仪器设备，又招了一批工人，利用这些设备进行生产。现在，全厂有一百多台机床，很多都是新式的，不仅超过全市公私合营工厂，有些还超过了国营工厂。一百三十多名工人中，四级工以上的技术工人就有七十多人。这样的实习工厂，不仅在全国的高等学校中是第一流的，据苏联专家杜比宁说：这个实习工厂有些车间比苏联著名的鲍曼高等技术学院的车间大二分之一甚至三分之二。两年来，工厂生产了总值二十五万元的产品，其中三万多元的产品供应了外地。工厂生产的专门检查油墨、油漆细度的细度计销到全国许多城市的油漆厂、油墨厂和新闻等单位。工厂生产的电磁开关也受到外地的欢迎。学校在研究发挥设备的潜力方面，也做了一些工作。例如将车间容量缩小，每次进车间实习的人数降低了50％左右，使实习学生的班次增加，就能提高设备利用率一倍，同时也保证了实习的质量。但是，机器设备的利用率仍然很低，使用率最高的五十台车床，也顶不上其他工厂的半班生产。全厂的开支有一半还依靠国家供给。
    负责领导这个实习工厂的机械系和工厂的领导人员以及部分教师，过去一直没有认识到利用率这样低是一种严重的浪费。尽管有些工人、学生对积压机器表示很不满意，但是他们却有自己的看法。他们认为为了教学和科学研究的需要，就是只开动几下，让学生们看一看也是必要的，根本不是积压浪费。也有些教师认为一个工科大学，应该有个像样的实习工厂，一切都要大的、好的、新的，有的领导人提出的发展方案比苏联最高标准还要高。至于这些设备用不用，他们很少考虑。还有个别的人认为有些设备现在用不着，将来可能用得着，也不能算积压。这次整风运动展开后，学校掀起了反浪费的高潮，许多教师、学生、职工对这种浪费现象提出了尖锐的批评，特别是许多工人，尽管他们不懂得教学业务，但是他们看到国家物资白白的浪费感到十分痛心，贴出了大字报批评。很多人要求立即克服这种浪费国家财产的现象，建议把实习工厂改为生产单位，接受外来订货，力争做到自给自足。
    实习工厂改为生产单位会不会影响教学质量？开始有人担心这个问题。机械系副系主任王守融教授认为这种担心是不必要的。他说：只要实习和生产安排好，不仅不会影响教学质量，反而会提高教学质量，收到理论和实际相结合的效果。因为这样做，可以加强学生的责任心，锻炼他们严格的工作态度。过去他们生产零件时首先考虑到“反正还得回炉”，积极性自然就受到影响；现在他们做一件产品时首先就考虑到这是支援工、农业生产的，工作时就更认真。同时，这样做还可以克服过去教学与生产实习相脱节的情况。过去实习工厂大多是单件生产或修修配配，而教学大纲和教学计划的内容要求较高，两者往往结合不起来，因此，教师和学生们一到假期就到很远的第一流大厂实习。改为生产单位以后，有成批生产，技术水平也比较高，师生们即可在本校实习，教学内容和实习紧密地结合起来，会提高教学质量。
    也有人担心改为生产单位，能不能自给，能不能创造更多的财富？在西安第一航空技工学校和北京航空学院的先进事迹公布后，很多人不再这样看了。正如郭晓鹏说的：“人家一年创造几十万元的财富，我们机器设备比他们好，又是机械系的教师和学生，为什么我们不能办到呢！？”郭晓鹏还算了一笔账：在目前的设备条件下，发挥了潜力以后，每年给国家创造七十万元的财富并不是很困难的。
    天津大学实习工厂设备利用率低的严重情况，引起了这个学校党和行政领导方面的重视。学校方面急起响应党和政府的号召，学习北京航空学院，决心使实习工厂开工生产。最近，学校已派了得力的干部来领导这个实习工厂。并初步制定了规划，确定在上半年内将实习工厂改为生产单位，除进行教学实习、制造本校所需要的仪器设备以外，并接受外来订货，为其他单位制造机器、仪器或零件加工。为贯彻教学、生产两不误的方针，初步确定将机械加工车间改为教学和生产两个车间。在教学车间，实行实习二部制，每天排十二节实习课。这样可将原有教学设备腾出四十部机床，专门进行生产。教学车间，实习之余，也进行生产。生产车间，接受外来订货，进行大批生产。使用熟练工人作出合格工件，并可吸收教职员、学生参加劳动。现在工厂的职工们干劲很足，教师、学生们也十分欢迎将实习工厂改为生产单位。工厂领导人正与天津市的企业单位接洽订货，职工们也积极准备调整厂房、机器。他们满怀信心地为实现几年内达到产值二百五十多万元，为国家积累一百三十多万元的指标而加紧工作着。
    当我结束了天津大学的访问的时候，太阳已经落山，卫津路上仍然车水马龙。汽车载运着建筑器材、原材料和各种产品飞驰而过，农民们运肥料的马车也络绎不绝，刚刚下班的工人们更是朝气勃勃，到处是一片振奋人心的景象。但愿天津大学这个冷落的实习工厂赶上当前一日千里的形势快马加鞭，向北京航空学院、西安第一航空技工学校看齐，参加到大跃进的行列里来！（附图片）
