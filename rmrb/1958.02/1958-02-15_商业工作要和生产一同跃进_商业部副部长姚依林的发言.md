I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of the commercial sector supporting the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects.

    **Vigorously Supply Materials for Water Conservancy Construction**

Commercial workers have put forward the heroic slogan: "Fear neither high mountains nor long roads, neither scorching heat nor sweltering summers, neither rain nor snow nor wind nor frost, regardless of traversing mountains and wading through rivers, delivering goods to the countryside at any time."

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, commercial work must also leap forward together. This is primarily reflected in the supply of materials for the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects. Most of the materials needed for the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects are obtained locally by farmers, but there is still a significant portion that needs to be supported by cities to the countryside, and industry to agriculture, through commercial departments to organize the supply. According to a survey in Yancheng, Jiangsu, manufacturing a windmill to irrigate 40 mu of land requires 14 jin of lead wire, 7 jin of iron parts, and 66 chi of white cloth; the annual maintenance materials require 1.4 jin of lead wire and 22 chi of white cloth. In Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, irrigating 1,000 mu of land with electricity requires an average of 15.9 horsepower of electric motors, 51.3 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, 6.67 tons of cement, 0.43 tons of aluminum wire, 115 kilograms of lead wire, 12.5 kilograms of round nails, and 2.04 tons of steel, in addition to various parts such as rubber wire, electricity meters, and switches. According to a survey in Hebei Province, building a small reservoir requires an average of 14 tons of cement; drilling a machine well requires an average of 150 kilograms of cement. From the perspective of a single water lifting and drainage machine, a machine well, or a small water conservancy project, the required materials are small, but if the materials required for the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects across the country are added together, it is a very large number. The source of these materials, of course, mainly relies on industrial production, and is allocated uniformly by the state. However, due to the unprecedented surge in production enthusiasm among the broad masses of farmers after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the original construction plans have been repeatedly exceeded, and the required materials have also been repeatedly increased. Although the state material allocation departments have made great efforts to ensure supply, squeezing out some materials that could be postponed from many industrial and capital construction departments for use in agricultural water conservancy, they still cannot fully meet the rapidly growing needs of various regions. Under these circumstances, the staff of commercial departments in various regions have actively and comprehensively organized the sourcing of goods. Commercial employees in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, held a mobilization meeting to support the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects, and put forward the slogan "Fear neither high mountains nor long roads, neither scorching heat nor sweltering summers, neither rain nor snow nor wind nor frost, regardless of traversing mountains and wading through rivers, delivering goods to the countryside at any time," fully demonstrating the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of commercial workers in supporting the agricultural water conservancy construction movement. Under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, and with the help of the broad masses of workers across the country, many factories have increased production to support rural areas, and many handicraft production cooperatives and small factories have processed and modified waste materials; relying on the help of foreign trade departments, the export of some industrial equipment has been stopped to support the urgent needs of agricultural water conservancy construction. It is precisely because of the active support from all sides that we have been able to organize a part of the supply beyond the plan to meet the needs of agricultural water conservancy construction, which we are very grateful for. Due to the increase in state allocation and the achievements in organizing sources of goods in various regions, the original plan to supply 525,000 tons of cement to the market in the fourth quarter of last year and the first half of this year has been increased to 668,000 tons, round nails have been increased from 69,000 tons to 76,000 tons, lead wire has been increased from 78,000 tons to 91,000 tons, large truck tires have been increased from 73,000 to 87,000, handcart tires have been increased from 3.43 million to 3.74 million, and various other materials have also been increased by varying amounts. The current situation is that in some places, the supply of some agricultural water conservancy materials has generally approached meeting the needs, for example, Anguo County in Hebei Province needed 108 tons of lead wire and has been supplied 116 tons, and needed 953 bolts of window screening and has been supplied 910 bolts. However, in many other places, there are still many varieties that are severely insufficient. Commercial departments should continue to work hard to organize sources of goods, highly promote revolutionary vigor, and closely cooperate with production departments, material allocation departments, and other relevant departments to make the greatest efforts to tap potential in order to meet the needs of agricultural water conservancy construction as much as possible. At the same time, we also ask Party and government organs in various regions to fully utilize the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses, lead the masses to study the economical use of agricultural water conservancy materials, and, without affecting the quality of the projects, adopt substitutes as much as possible, in order to complete more agricultural water conservancy construction with fewer materials. Many regions already have a lot of successful experience, which needs to be summarized and promoted. We also suggest that various regions, in conjunction with the long-term plan for realizing the 40-Article Program for Agriculture, absorb commercial departments to participate in the formulation of long-term plans for the agricultural water conservancy materials needed, and commercial departments should also actively investigate and calculate the needs for agricultural water conservancy materials, actively promote advanced experiences in saving materials and using substitutes, and provide information and opinions to local Party and government leading organs, so as to organize production early, replenish inventories, and prepare for the great leap forward in agricultural water conservancy this winter and next spring and in the future.

    **Carry Out a Massive Anti-Waste Movement, and Business Management Will Also Have a New Leap Forward**

The rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle have greatly enhanced the political awareness of commercial workers across the country and stimulated unprecedented revolutionary vigor. This revolutionary vigor has now become a huge force for improving business management in the commercial sector. Recently, the leading comrades and all employees of the Beijing Cultural Goods Company launched a massive anti-waste movement. Through the forms of large-scale airing of views, debates, and wall posters, they exposed a large number of wasteful phenomena in one week. The most serious of these was in the autumn of 1956, when the supply of goods on the market was relatively tight, and procurement personnel were sent everywhere to grab goods, buying many commodities that did not meet the needs of the people, causing serious waste and losses. The total bill was approximately 500,000 yuan for this one company alone. For example, in August 1956, more than 700 high-end cameras were purchased from Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and more than 400 of them have not been sold to this day, occupying more than 500,000 yuan in capital; at that time, the company's leading comrades, because paper was out of stock, instructed the procurement personnel going out to "buy any paper they see," and as a result, they bought a batch of paper of very poor quality, which was sold at a loss. There were dozens of such examples in one unit of the Beijing Cultural Goods Company. The lesson of blindly grabbing goods when the supply of goods is tight is worth remembering deeply by all commercial workers. Now the company's leading comrades and all employees are taking active action on the basis of large-scale airing of views, clearing all goods, finding out the inventory situation, identifying goods that have expired or are about to expire, formulating disposal methods, analyzing the sales patterns of various commodities, and formulating reasonable inventory quotas; and they are preparing to implement assessed capital on the basis of maintaining reasonable inventory quotas, thereby overcoming blindness in management not only ideologically but also institutionally. In the anti-waste movement, commercial workers in many places exposed waste in many ways, such as poor commodity storage, unreasonable transportation routes, errors and accidents in work, corruption, theft, etc., especially thoroughly criticizing the extravagant and wasteful thinking of building department stores, buying glass counters, and installing neon lights to "show off," "pay attention to ostentation," and "beautify the city," and establishing a frugal style. We believe that this is a new atmosphere in the commercial sector. Continuing to carry forward this revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses will surely lead to a new leap forward in improving business management, achieving more goods, faster turnover, better quality, and lower costs. Of course, in the anti-waste movement, it is also necessary to conduct specific analysis of what is waste and what is not waste. It should be affirmed that in order to support the development of industrial production, some commodities that cannot be sold temporarily were purchased, occupying capital and storage space, incurring expenses, paying interest, and even incurring some unavoidable natural losses. From a policy perspective, this is absolutely necessary and should not be treated as waste indiscriminately, affecting the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in supporting the leap forward in production.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above opinions, please correct me.

专栏：

    商业工作要和生产一同跃进
    商业部副部长姚依林的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的报告。现在我仅就商业部门支援兴修农田水利的问题，发表一点意见。
    大力供应修水利器材
    商业工作者提出豪迈的口号：“不怕山高路远，不怕炎天暑热，不怕雨雪风霜，那管翻山涉水，随时送货到四乡。”
    工农业生产大跃进，商业工作也要一同跃进。这首先表现在兴修农田水利的器材供应方面。兴修农田水利需用的器材，大部分是依靠农民就地取材的，但也还有相当重要的一部分，需要由城市支援乡村，工业支援农业，通过商业部门来组织供应。根据江苏盐城的调查，制造一部灌溉四十亩地的风车，需要铅丝十四斤，铁件七斤，白布六十六尺；每年的维修用料，需要铅丝一点四斤，白布二十二尺。在江苏省江都县，用电力灌溉一千亩地，平均需要电动机十五点九马力，变压器五十一点三千伏安，水泥六点六七吨，铝线零点四三吨，铅丝一百一十五公斤，元钉十二点五公斤，钢材二点零四吨，此外，还需要皮线、电表、开关等各种零件。根据河北省的调查，修建一个小型水库，平均需要水泥十四吨；打一眼机井，平均需要水泥一百五十公斤。从一部提水排灌机械、一口机井或者一个小型水利工程来看，所需要的器材是很少的，但是如果把全国各地兴修农田水利工程所需要的器材加在一起，就是一个很大的数字。这些物资的来源，当然主要依靠工业生产，经过国家统一分配。但是，由于广大农民群众在整风和反右派斗争之后，生产积极性空前高涨，原定的工程计划一再被突破，因而所需要的器材，也一再追加。虽然国家物资分配部门在保证供应上作了很大的努力，从许多工业、基本建设部门挤出一部分可以推迟使用的物资用到兴修农田水利方面，但是仍然不能完全满足各地迅速增长的需要。在这种情况下，各地商业部门的工作人员，积极地、多方面地进行了组织货源的工作。湖北省红安县的商业职工为支援兴修农田水利运动举行了誓师大会，提出了“不怕山高路远，不怕炎天暑热，不怕雨雪风霜，那管翻山涉水，随时送货到四乡”的口号，充分表现了广大商业职工支援兴修农田水利运动的革命干劲。在各地党政的领导下，依靠全国各地广大职工的帮助，许多工厂为支援农村而增加了生产，许多手工业生产合作社和小工厂，对废料进行了加工改制；依靠对外贸易部门的帮助，停止了若干工业器材的出口，支援农田水利建设的急需。正是由于各方面的积极支援，才使我们得以超计划地组织到一部分货源，供应兴修农田水利的需要，这是我们所十分感谢的。由于国家分配的增加和各地组织货源的成绩，原计划在去年四季度和今年上半年供应市场水泥五十二万五千吨，已经增加到六十六万八千吨，元钉由六万九千吨，增加到七万六千吨，铅丝由七万八千吨增加到九万一千吨，大车轮胎由七万三千条增加到八万七千条，手推车胎由三百四十三万条增加到三百七十四万条，其他各种器材也有多少不等的增加。当前的情况，是在一部分地方，一部分农田水利器材的供应，大体已接近满足需要，例如河北省安国县需用铅丝一百零八吨，已经供应了一百一十六吨，需用窗纱九百五十三匹，已经供应了九百一十匹。但是还有许多地方，有不少品种仍然感到严重不足。商业部门应当继续努力组织货源，高度发扬革命干劲，与生产部门、物资分配部门和其他有关部门密切配合，尽最大的努力来挖掘潜力，以求尽可能满足兴修农田水利的需要。同时我们也要求各地党政机关，充分发挥群众的智慧和积极性，领导群众研究农田水利器材的节约使用，和在不影响工程质量的前提下，尽可能采用代用品，以求使用较少的器材，完成更多的农田水利建设。各地已经有不少的成功经验，需要加以总结、推广。我们并建议各地结合实现农业四十条纲要的长期规划，吸收商业部门参加制订需用农田水利器材的长期规划，商业部门也应当积极调查、计算兴修农田水利器材的需要，积极推广节约器材和使用代用品的先进经验，向当地党政领导机关提供资料和意见，以便及早地组织生产，充实库存，为今冬明春和今后的农田水利大跃进作好准备。
    开展声势浩大的反浪费运动  经营管理工作也将有新跃进
    整风运动和反右派斗争，使全国商业工作人员的政治觉悟大大提高，激发了空前未有的革命干劲，这股革命干劲现在已经成为商业部门改进经营管理工作的巨大力量。最近北京市文化用品公司的领导同志和全体职工，开展了声势浩大的反浪费运动，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的形式，以一星期的时间，揭发了大量的浪费现象。其中最为严重的，是在一九五六年秋季，由于市场商品供应较为紧张，派遣采购人员到处抓货，买进了许多不合人民需要的商品，造成严重的浪费和损失。算起总账来，单这一个公司就大约浪费了五十万元左右。例如一九五六年八月份，从广州、上海和天津买进了七百多架高级照相机，至今还有四百多架没有卖出去，占压了五十多万元的资金；当时公司的领导同志因为纸张脱销，吩咐外出的采购人员“见纸就要”，结果买进了一批质量很坏的纸张，赔了很多钱才卖出去。像这样的例子，在北京文化用品公司一个单位中，就有几十起。这种在商品供应紧张的时候盲目抓货的教训，是值得全体商业工作人员深刻记取的。现在公司的领导同志和全体职工正在大鸣大放的基础上，积极地行动起来，清理全部商品，摸清库存情况；找出已经过期失效的商品和将要过期失效的商品，拟定处理办法；分析各类商品的销售规律，制定合理的库存定额；并准备在保有合理库存定额的基础上，实行核定资金，从而不仅从思想上，而且从制度上克服经营中的盲目性。许多地方的商业职工，在反浪费运动中，从多方面揭发了浪费现象，例如商品保管不善，运输路线不合理，工作中的差错事故，贪污、盗窃等，特别是彻底批判了那种盖百货大楼，买玻璃柜台，装霓虹灯的“摆阔气”、“讲排场”、“美化市容”的铺张浪费思想，树立了节约朴素的风气。我们认为这是商业部门中的一个新气象，把群众的这种革命积极性继续发扬下去，必将在改进经营管理方面出现一个新的跃进，做到商品多、周转快、质量好、费用省。当然，在反浪费运动中，还要对那些是浪费，那些不是浪费进行具体的分析。应当肯定，为了支持工业生产的发展，因而购进了一些暂时还销不出去的商品，占用了资金和仓容，开支了费用，支付了利息，甚至发生了一些不可避免的自然损耗，从政策上来看，这是完全必要的，不应当不加区别地都当作浪费来反，影响广大职工支持生产跃进的积极性。
    以上意见，如有不当之处，请各位代表指正。
