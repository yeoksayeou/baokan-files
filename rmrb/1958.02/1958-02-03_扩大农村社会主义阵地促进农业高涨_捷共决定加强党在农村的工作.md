　　Prague Dispatch from Our Newspaper, January 31st. The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's publication "Party Life" recently published a resolution of the CCP Central Committee "Concerning the Work of Party Organizations in Rural Areas." Currently, the CCP Party Committees of states and counties across the country are discussing this document.

    The resolution emphasizes that in order to consolidate and expand the socialist position in the countryside and rapidly increase agricultural production, the Party's task is to improve the Party's level of agricultural management. To this end, it is necessary to improve the Party's political and organizational work, develop rural Party organizations, and inspire the creativity and enthusiasm of cooperative members.

    The resolution points out that profound changes are currently taking place in rural areas. Socialist factors are increasingly dominant, and the power of the rich peasants has been overthrown. With the development of socialist cooperative large-scale production, a new class—cooperative farmers—has emerged and is growing in the countryside. Rural Party organizations have implemented the Party's policies, thereby playing a decisive role in this great transformation.

    The resolution requires rural Party organizations to further take responsibility for the status quo and development of cooperatives. Communist Party members must be responsible for improving the leadership of production, strengthening the organizational work of cooperatives, and raising the political awareness and professional knowledge of cooperative members. An important link in the work of Party organizations is to maintain close contact with all Party members and cooperative members, to care for, cultivate, and understand them, to guide them on the road and methods of advancement, and to encourage them to actively participate in the formulation and discussion of production plans.

    The resolution emphatically points out that because the significance of the Party's management of agriculture and the tasks of village Party organizations are increasing day by day, the CCP Central Committee has stipulated several new principles for building the Party in rural areas. According to the prospects of the agricultural cooperation movement, it is necessary to implement the principle of regional production in rural areas, that is, to establish primary Party organizations in cooperatives, basically one Party branch per village. If there are several cooperatives in a village, several branches can also be established. Party groups are established within the cooperative according to work teams.

    The resolution also mentioned that county Party committees should strengthen their assistance to rural Party organizations, mobilize all departments and institutions in the county, especially the county people's committees and state tractor stations, to care about agriculture, transfer cadres from old cooperatives and factories to support new cooperatives, and persuade agricultural experts working in other fields to return to agriculture.

　　扩大农村社会主义阵地促进农业高涨
    捷共决定加强党在农村的工作
    本报布拉格31日电　捷共中央刊物“党的生活”最近一期上发表了捷共中央“关于农村党组织工作”的决议。目前全国州和县的捷共党委会正讨论这个文件。
    决议强调，为了巩固和扩大农村社会主义阵地并迅速增加农业生产，党的任务是提高党管理农业的水平，为此必须改善党的政治和组织工作，发展农村党组织，启发合作社社员的创造性与积极性。
    决议指出：当前农村正发生着深刻的变革，社会主义因素越来越占有优势，富农的势力已被打倒。随着社会主义合作化大生产的发展，农村中出现了并成长着一个新的阶级——合作社员农民。农村党组织实现了党的政策，从而在这一巨大变革中起了决定性作用。
    决议要求农村党组织进一步对合作社的现状和发展负责，共产党员要负责改进对生产的领导，加强合作社的组织工作，并提高合作社员的政治觉悟和专业知识。党组织工作中的重要环节是密切同全体党员和合作社员的联系，关怀、培养和了解他们，指引他们前进的道路和方法，促使他们积极参加生产计划的制订和讨论。
    决议着重指出：由于党管理农业的意义和乡村党组织的任务日益增长，捷共中央规定了农村建党的几项新的原则。根据农业合作化运动的前景有必要在农村中贯彻地域生产原则，这就是在合作社里建立党的基层组织，基本上一村建立一个党支部。如果一村有几个合作社，也可建立几个支部。合作社内按工作队建立党小组。
    决议还谈到应加强县党委会对农村党组织的帮助，动员全县所有部门和机构，特别是县人民委员会和国家拖拉机站关心农业。从老社和工厂抽调干部支援新的合作社，说服在其他领域工作的农业专家回到农业中去。
