　　The Theory of Losing Money on Business Trips
　　First Ministry of Machine Building Industry　Yang You
　　As far as I know, there is a prevailing argument in some state organs – that business trips lose money. After returning from a business trip, people often use this as a reason to apply for hardship subsidies. It's as if this is a truth, and no one refutes it.
　　Does a business trip necessarily lose money? How is it lost? No one has explored this. It was not until we recently discussed a comrade's application for a hardship subsidy that I understood the truth. The comrade's reason for applying for the subsidy was: "I have been on a business trip for six months, which has caused financial difficulties." From the situations introduced and revealed at the discussion, each person on a business trip has a daily allowance of 60 cents, which could prevent losing money, and even potentially make money. However, they often spend money recklessly during business trips: some buy local specialties wherever they go; some take this opportunity to set up "personal basic construction," such as watches, suitcases, serge uniforms, etc.; some eat and drink extravagantly, going to restaurants for every meal, tasting local famous dishes... After they return, they often can't help but exclaim "This business trip cost me dozens of yuan again," spreading the theory that business trips lose money.
　　It can be seen that business trips do not necessarily lose money; the problem lies in whether one is wasteful.

　　出差赔钱论
　　第一机械工业部　杨尤
    据我所知，有些国家机关里，流行着一种论调——出差赔钱。出差者回来以后，往往以此为理由，申请困难补助。仿佛这是真理，谁也不来反驳。
    出差是否一定赔钱？怎么赔的？并没有人去探索。直到我们最近对一个同志的困难补助申请进行了讨论，我才明白了真相。这个同志申请补助的理由就是这么一条：“本人因出差六个月，故造成生活困难。”从讨论会上彼此介绍和揭发的情况看，出差者每人每日有六角钱的补贴费，本可以不赔钱的，甚至还可能赚钱。但是他们在出差期间往往乱花钱：有的是每到一地就要买些土特产；有的是乘此置办“个人基本建设”，如手表、皮箱、哔叽制服等；有的是大吃大喝，顿顿上馆子，尝当地名菜，……。他们回来后，又往往情不自禁地叫嚷“这次出差又赔了几十元”，散布出差赔钱论。
    可见出差并不一定赔钱，问题在于自己是否浪费。
