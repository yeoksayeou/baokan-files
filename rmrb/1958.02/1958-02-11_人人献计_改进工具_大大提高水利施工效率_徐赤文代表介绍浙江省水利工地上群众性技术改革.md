    Everyone Contributes Ideas and Improves Tools
    Greatly Improving the Efficiency of Water Conservancy Construction
    Xu Chiwen Introduces Mass Technical Reform on Water Conservancy Construction Sites in Zhejiang Province

    The farmland water conservancy construction movement in Zhejiang Province is developing vigorously. More than three million water control workers are working hard day and night. At present, more than 225,000 projects have been completed or are under construction in the province, including more than 11,500 medium and small reservoirs. Such a large-scale mass water control movement is unprecedented in Zhejiang. It shows the unparalleled determination of farmers across the province to realize a great leap forward in agricultural production, and also demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the agricultural cooperative system.
    In this large-scale water conservancy construction movement, because the broad masses are eager to improve labor efficiency and reduce labor intensity, various new examples of tool improvement have emerged in many areas of the province, and the achievements of the Yuxi Reservoir construction site in the suburban township of Ruian County are the most remarkable.

    Ruian County Committee comrades and the masses actively used their brains and took the lead in mass technological reforms.
    Like all water conservancy construction sites in the province, the Yuxi Reservoir has had thousands of people engaged in earthwork construction every day for more than two months. The responsible comrades of the county party committee also led cadres to participate in labor. They were very enthusiastic, but because the tools used were old, labor efficiency was very low. Under the urgent demand to improve tools, a mass technical reform movement was launched on the construction site in mid-January. First, the responsible comrades of the Ruian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, under the instruction and inspiration of the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, actively used their brains, braved the severe cold and heavy rain, and persisted in overnight experiments on the construction site, creating the "bamboo rail dirt sliding method" which is five times faster than manual dirt carrying. This set a precedent for mass technical reform. When farmers, residents, students, and office cadres went to work the next morning, they saw a long bamboo rail erected from the top of the mountain to the dam foundation, and scoops full of mud and soil slid quickly along the bamboo rail. The entire construction site was boiling, and everyone's interest and confidence in improving tools was greatly enhanced. Then, the county party committee leadership seized this opportunity to immediately mobilize cadres and the masses to launch a "everyone contributes ideas movement," proposing the slogan "everyone uses their brains, everyone finds tricks, actively creates day and night, improves tools, and improves work efficiency." The mass technical reform movement then entered a climax. Gao Zongyou, director of the Tax Bureau, led cadres and the masses to persist for three days and nights in the snow, and after many experiments, created the "bamboo ladder round-trip soil transportation method"; Li Dongqiao, director of the supply and marketing cooperative, personally climbed up the cliff to drive piles, and together with cadres and the masses, created the "triangular slide soil transportation method"; farmer Lin Deyi and others created the "cattle-pulled stone roller compaction method"; Lu Yongquan, a member of the ironware cooperative, created the "steel bar aerial soil transportation method"; Ruian middle school student Miao Shigui and others created the "single bamboo rail soil transportation method." In just one week, more than thirty new types of tools were created in the Yuxi Reservoir and the nearby digging river land. Although these new tools created in ordinary labor were made of ordinary materials, they were very efficient. The best ones could increase work efficiency by more than ten times and greatly reduce labor intensity. With the change of tools, they also changed the labor organization accordingly, dividing the work into sections according to the construction procedure, implementing quota management, and launching labor competitions. The labor efficiency of the entire reservoir construction was more than three times higher than before.

    After the new tool was successfully tested and had a prototype, the Ruian County Party Committee immediately convened more than 2,100 leading cadres, agricultural cooperative chairmen, and model workers from various districts and townships to visit and study at the Yuxi Reservoir construction site, requiring all districts and townships to use these new tools or create new ones according to local conditions, and to double the efficiency of water conservancy construction throughout the county. They also transferred cadres to form eight technical guidance groups to go to various districts for guidance. In this way, it is estimated that the county can save 1.27 million workdays compared to the original plan, and can build 630 more ponds and 320,000 fish scale pits and mountain thatch pits outside the plan, and also ensure that there is enough labor to carry out manure accumulation, spring flower cultivation, greening and sideline production.

    New tools are successfully tested, and visits and studies are immediately organized to implement comprehensive promotion and improve water conservancy construction efficiency.

    The reason why Ruian County has achieved greater success in the technical reform work of water conservancy construction sites is mainly due to the responsible comrades of the county party committee conscientiously implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to learn from the leadership experience of Hong'an County in Hubei Province in running experimental fields, and applying it specifically to the current water conservancy movement. In particular, their study of Hong'an County's experience is not like some people who only stay at the verbal call, but honestly put down the "official airs," go deep into the site, do it themselves, and conduct experiments overnight, and then immediately promote it comprehensively after producing a prototype. Such a learning method is worth advocating.

    The reason why Ruian County's technical reform has achieved greater success is also because the county party committee leadership can resolutely follow the mass line, combine leadership with the masses, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, especially give full play to the role of office cadres and intellectuals, and closely combine mental labor with physical labor. This is very different from the situation in individual areas of the province where they rely solely on technicians and cannot combine technology with the masses, resulting in two new tools still being designed after a week.

    To implement technical reform, we must vigorously support new things and require strong support from all relevant departments.
    To carry out technical reform, we must vigorously support new things and overcome conservative thinking. When Ruian County was experimenting with the "steel bar aerial soil transportation method," at the beginning, it used wooden barrels to hold soil and slide on thin iron ropes. Not only were the iron ropes easy to break, but the impact force from top to bottom was large, and the wooden barrels were smashed. At that time, some people objected, saying, "This is a waste of manpower and materials." However, the leadership believed that this was a sign of success and always encouraged and supported it. Later, gasoline drums were modified to replace wooden barrels, and steel bars were used to replace iron ropes, and finally it was successful. When people saw gasoline drums running back and forth along a 120-meter-long steel bar, transporting five loads of soil every forty seconds, they were all overjoyed, and those who had previously opposed and doubted it were also convinced.

    Technical reform also requires strong support from relevant departments in terms of manpower and material resources. When Ruian County was experimenting with the "steel bar aerial soil transportation method," there were no steel bars, and the county handicraft industry association took out steel bars; there were no gasoline drums, and the supply and marketing general cooperative took out gasoline drums; there were no palm ropes, and the rope-making cooperative rushed to make two palm ropes weighing more than ninety catties overnight; there were no welders, and the nearby condensed milk factory sent technicians to weld steel bars. Their slogan was "Whatever you want, we have it," "Do it as soon as you arrive, day and night." This enabled the mass technical reform to be promoted smoothly.

    The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Wenzhou Prefectural Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to go all out and achieve a great leap forward in socialist production, gave great support and encouragement to the technical reform movement in Ruian County. The Wenzhou Prefectural Party Committee convened more than 1,000 responsible cadres and water conservancy representatives from various counties in the region to visit Ruian. In addition to learning how to manufacture new tools and improve the management of water conservancy construction sites, they particularly emphasized learning the leadership methods of the Ruian County Party Committee. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee also led responsible cadres from various localities and counties to visit and study in Ruian. Now the technical reform movement is being rapidly promoted throughout the province, and many new creations have emerged. Many counties and districts have re-revised their water control plans based on the new situation after technical reform. This provides a strong guarantee for us to complete this year's water conservancy work plan ahead of schedule, and for the plan to build 200,000 small reservoirs and eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters in the province within five years, and also creates extremely favorable conditions for a great leap forward in agricultural production.

    人人献计　改进工具
    大大提高水利施工效率
    徐赤文代表介绍浙江省水利工地上群众性技术改革
    浙江省的兴修农田水利运动正在热火朝天地向前发展。三百多万人的治水大军夜以继日地进行着紧张的劳动。目前全省已经完工和正在施工的工程有二十二万五千余处，其中，中、小型水库就有一万一千五百余座。这样规模巨大的群众性治水运动在浙江是空前的，它显示了全省农民实现农业生产大跃进的无比决心，也显示了农业合作化制度的无比优越性。
    在这个大规模的兴修水利运动中，由于广大群众迫切希望提高劳动效率和减轻劳动强度，全省不少地区都出现各种各样的改进工具的新鲜事例，而以瑞安县城郊乡愚溪水库工地的成就最为显著。
    瑞安县委负责同志和群众一起，积极开动脑筋，为群众性技术改革发出了先声
    愚溪水库和全省各处水利工地一样，二个多月以来，每天都有数以千计的群众从事土工建设，县委负责同志也带领干部参加劳动。他们的干劲很高，但由于使用的工具是古老的，劳动效率很低。在迫切要求改进工具的情绪下，一月中旬，工地上掀起了群众性的技术改革运动。首先是中共瑞安县委负责同志在省委负责同志的指示和启发之下，和群众一起，积极开动脑筋，冒着严寒和大雨，在工地上坚持通宵试验，创造了比人工挑土快五倍的“竹轨溜土法”，这就为群众性的技术改革发出了先声。当农民、居民、学生和机关干部第二天早上上工时，看到一副长长的竹轨已经从山头架设到坝基，一个个满盛泥土的畚箕飞快地沿着竹轨溜滑下来，整个工地沸腾了，大家对改进工具的兴趣和信心也大大提高了。接着，县委领导上抓住这个时机立刻动员干部和群众掀起一个“人人献计运动”，提出“人人动脑筋，个个找窍门，不分昼夜，积极创造，改进工具，提高工效”的号召。群众性的技术改革运动于是进入了一个高潮。税务局长高宗有在雪花纷飞中，带领干部、群众坚持三昼夜，经过多次试验，创造了“竹梯巡回运土法”；供销社主任李东桥亲自爬上悬崖打桩，同干部、群众一起创造了“三角溜板运土法”；农民林德寅等创造了“牛拉石滚压土法”；铁器社社员卢永权创造了“钢条架空运土法”；瑞安中学生缪世贵等创造了“单竹轨运土法”。在短短一个星期内，愚溪水库和附近挖河土地，共计创造三十多种新式工具。这些在平凡劳动中所创造的新式工具虽然都是用普通的材料做成的，但效率颇高，最好的，能提高工效十倍以上，并大大减轻了劳动强度。随着工具的改变，他们还相应地改变劳动组织，按照施工程序划分工段，实行定额管理，展开劳动竞赛。整个水库施工的劳动效率比原来的提高了三倍多。
    新工具试验成功，有了样子以后，瑞安县委立即召集各区、乡领导干部、农业社长、劳动模范等二千一百多人到愚溪水库工地参观学习，要求各区、乡都能因地制宜地使用这些新工具或另行创造，把全县水利施工效率提高一倍。他们还抽调干部组成八个技术辅导组，分赴各区进行辅导。这样一来，预计全县可以比原计划节省一百二十七万个工日，并可在计划外增建六百三十口水塘和三十二万个鱼鳞坑、山茅坑，而且还保证了有足够的劳动力去进行积肥、培育春花、绿化和副业生产。
    新工具试验成功，立即组织参观学习，实行全面推广，提高水利施工效率
    瑞安县在水利工地的技术改革工作上之所以取得较大成绩，主要是由于县委负责同志认真执行了党中央和毛主席号召我们学习湖北省红安县搞试验田的领导经验的这一指示，并把它具体运用到当前的水利运动中去。特别是他们学习红安县的经验，并不是像有些人那样，只停留在口头上的号召，而是老老实实的放下“官架子”，深入现场，亲自动手，通宵达旦的进行试验，在搞出样子以后，即行全面推广。这样的学习方法是值得提倡的。
    瑞安县技术改革所以获得较大的成绩，还由于县委领导上能坚决走群众路线，做到领导与群众相结合，充分发挥群众的智慧，特别是充分发挥了机关干部、知识分子的作用，使脑力劳动与体力劳动密切地结合起来。这就与本省个别地区单纯依靠技术人员，而不能使技术和群众相结合，结果搞了一个星期，两件新工具还在设计中的情况大不相同。
    实行技术改革，必须大力支持新鲜事物，要求各有关部门的大力支持
    进行技术改革，必须大力支持新鲜事物，克服保守思想。瑞安县在试验“钢条架空运土法”时，开头是用木桶盛土在细铁索上滑行，不仅铁索易断，而且由上而下，冲击力大，木桶碰得粉碎。当时就有人表示反对，他们说：“这是浪费人力、浪费材料”。但领导上却认为这是成功的苗头，始终予以鼓励和支持。后来用汽油桶改装代替木桶，用钢筋代替铁索，终于获得成功。当人们看到汽油桶沿着一百二十公尺长的钢条来回运转，每四十秒钟运土五担时，莫不欢欣鼓舞，原先抱反对和怀疑态度的人也都口服心服了。
    技术改革还需要各有关部门在人力、物力上的大力支援。瑞安县试验“钢条架空运土法”时，没有钢筋，县手工业联社就拿出钢筋；没有汽油桶，供销总社就拿出汽油桶；没有棕绳，打绳合作社就连夜赶制两条九十多斤重的棕绳；没有电焊工人，附近的炼乳厂就派出技术工人来焊接钢条。他们的口号是“要啥有啥”，“随到随做，不分昼夜”。这就使群众性的技术改革能够顺利地推行。
    中共浙江省委和温州地委遵照党中央和毛主席关于鼓足干劲，实现社会主义生产大跃进的指示精神，对于瑞安县这个技术改革运动，给予极大的支持和鼓励。温州地委召集了全区各县负责干部及水利代表一千余人到瑞安参观。除了学习制造新式工具和改进水利工地的管理以外，特别强调学习瑞安县委的领导方法。省委负责同志还带领各地、县委负责干部到瑞安参观学习。现在全省正在迅速地推广技术改革运动，并出现了不少新的创造。不少县、区已经根据技术改革后的新情况，重新修订治水计划。这就为我们提前实现今年的水利工作计划，和五年内在全省修建二十万个小型水库、消灭普通水旱灾害的规划，提供了有力的保证，同时也为农业生产大跃进创造极为有利的条件。
