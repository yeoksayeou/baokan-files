    Shanxi Promotes Pingyao Experience
    Developing Groundwater, Increasing New Irrigated Land
    (Our Dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction recently organized 286 cadres and farmer representatives from five special districts, forty-five counties, and the two cities of Datong and Changzhi to hold an on-site conference in Pingyao County on the development of groundwater. Using a method of simultaneous visits and discussions, they vigorously promoted Pingyao County's experience in developing and utilizing groundwater through diversified small-scale water conservancy projects.
    Pingyao County plans to expand new irrigated land by 150,000 mu this year. Thanks to their adoption of a small-scale, diversified approach, and their emphasis on the development and utilization of groundwater, they have already achieved remarkable results. Since the beginning of winter, the county has carried out small-scale water conservancy projects in various ways, according to different situations, including tunneling through mountains to divert water for irrigation, digging springs to intercept subsurface flow, mechanical irrigation on high ground, and well-drilling, which can increase new irrigated land by more than 125,000 mu in total.
    The on-site visit not only enabled the representatives from various places to further understand the importance of developing and utilizing groundwater through small-scale, diversified projects, and to learn the technical experience of the farmers in Pingyao County in developing and utilizing groundwater, but more importantly, it overcame the varying degrees of conservative thinking that the visitors originally had in the development and utilization of groundwater. At the on-site meeting, everyone agreed that Shanxi Province has very abundant groundwater resources, and that at least more than 14 million mu of land in the province is suitable for well-drilling, spring-digging, and subsurface flow interception. However, in recent years, because many areas have emphasized surface water but neglected the development of groundwater; have not clearly investigated groundwater resources and lack planning; and have not given sufficient play to the existing technical forces for well-drilling and spring-digging, only over 3 million mu of land is irrigated with groundwater in the province's existing irrigated area.
    Finally, the meeting determined that all localities should immediately carry out well-drilling, spring-digging, and subsurface flow interception work, and strive to ensure that the province increases new irrigated land by 3 million mu before the spring sowing.

    山西推广平遥经验
    开发地下水　增加新水地
    本报讯　山西省农业建设厅不久前组织了全省五个专区、四十五个县和大同、长治二市干部、农民代表二百八十六人，在平遥县举行开发地下水“现场会议”，以边参观、边讨论的方法，大力推广平遥县通过多样化的小型水利建设，开发、利用地下水的经验。
    平遥县计划今年扩大新水地十五万亩。由于他们采取了小型多样的方针，重视开发和利用地下水，已经取得显著成绩。入冬以来，这个县依据不同情况，进行了穿山打洞引水浇地、挖泉截潜流、高地机械灌溉、打井等项不同方式的小型水利建设，共可增加新水地十二万五千多亩。
    现场参观，不仅使各地代表进一步懂得了通过小型多样的工程，开发、利用地下水的重要性，学习了平遥县农民开发、利用地下水的技术经验，更重要的是克服了参观者原来在开发、利用地下水方面存在的不同程度的保守思想。在现场会议上，大家都认为：山西省地下水源十分丰富，全省至少有一千四百多万亩的地区都适宜于打井、挖泉和截潜流。但近几年来，由于不少地区重视了地面水、但忽视开发地下水；对地下水源摸得不清，缺乏规划；对已有的打井、挖泉技术力量发挥不够，所以在全省现有水地中，取地下水浇地的还不过三百万亩。
    最后，会议确定，各地应立即开展打井、挖泉、截潜流的工作，力争在春播前，保证全省增加三百万亩新水地。
