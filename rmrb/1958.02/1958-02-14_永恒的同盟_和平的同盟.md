    Today is a great festival of unity and friendship for the more than 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union. Eight years ago, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, thus beginning a new stage of friendly unity between the two great socialist countries of China and the Soviet Union. After the signing of this treaty, Chairman Mao Zedong said: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, is permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice." Eight years of history have fully demonstrated the great significance of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance.
    In the past eight years, the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union have been continuously strengthened, and unity has become increasingly consolidated. Especially in the past year, our two countries' friendly unity has further developed greatly. The visit of Chairman Voroshilov of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to our country and Chairman Mao Zedong leading the delegation of the People's Republic of China to Moscow to participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution are of great significance for strengthening the friendly unity between the people of our two countries and strengthening the friendly unity between the socialist camp. The visit of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation headed by Comrade Aristov to our country, the delegation of Soviet people from all walks of life headed by Comrade Andreyev, Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, to our country to participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and the delegation of Chinese labor representatives to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebration, have also made valuable contributions to strengthening the friendly relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet scientific and technological agreement signed in January this year is another major event in Sino-Soviet mutual assistance and cooperation. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will provide enormous assistance to the development of science and technology in our country. The increasingly close friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union are making these two great socialist countries increasingly prosperous and providing a more reliable guarantee for world peace.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is a treaty of peace. The great fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful pillar of world peace. If we look back at the past eight years, we will clearly see how remarkable a role this great fraternal alliance has played in maintaining world peace. China and the Soviet Union, together with the governments and peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as all peace-loving countries and peoples, jointly extinguished the aggressive wars waged by the imperialist countries headed by the United States in Korea and Indochina. The people of China and the Soviet Union unanimously supported the Egyptian people's war of self-defense against the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, and unanimously supported the Syrian people's resistance against the US aggression conspiracy, thereby making outstanding contributions to defending world peace.
    Our socialist countries have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. After the socialist camp gained the advantage, we not only did not use our advantage to threaten others, but on the contrary, we worked even more actively to ease international tensions and promote world peace. Since December last year, the Soviet government has put forward a series of major peace initiatives, advocating the convening of a summit conference of Eastern and Western countries, immediately stopping the testing of atomic and nuclear weapons, realizing the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe proposed by Poland and supported by Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, and the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and so on. Our government and people fully support these attractive suggestions of the Soviet government. Recently, after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward the proposal for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, our government fully supported these proposals and declared that it would consult with the Korean government on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers to promote the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean issue as soon as possible. All of this eloquently proves that the countries of the socialist camp have consistently and resolutely pursued a peaceful foreign policy.
    China and the Soviet Union, like other countries in the socialist camp, are working hard to win a peaceful international environment so that they can smoothly carry out socialist and communist construction. In the past year, the Soviet people have made great achievements in communist construction. The Soviet Union has effectively implemented the reorganization of the industrial and construction management system, which has greatly overfulfilled last year's industrial output; it has also achieved outstanding results in the per capita production of meat, milk, and fats. Following the establishment of the world's first atomic power station, the Soviet Union has also created the world's first atomic icebreaker and the world's first batch of intercontinental ballistic rockets. The Soviet Union successfully launched two artificial earth satellites, opening up a new era for mankind to conquer the universe. These brilliant achievements of the Soviet people have once again demonstrated to the world the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and greatly encouraged the people of all countries building socialism and all peace-loving people.
    In the past year, the people of our country have achieved major victories on both the socialist revolution and socialist construction fronts. The people of our country have completed and overfulfilled the first five-year plan for socialist construction. At present, an unprecedented high tide of striving for a great leap forward on all fronts of socialist construction has emerged throughout our country. In the process of socialist construction in our country, the Soviet Union has given us great and comprehensive assistance. By the end of last year, 57 major construction projects that the Soviet Union helped our country build during the first five-year plan period had been fully completed, and another seven had been partially completed and put into production. This has played a huge role in laying the foundation for socialist industrialization in our country during the first five-year plan period.
    The people of China and the Soviet Union, like the people of other countries in the socialist camp, not only have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but also fully believe that in the peaceful competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism, the socialist system will inevitably win. Recently, the Soviet Union has proposed to catch up with or surpass the United States in the output of various important industrial products within fifteen years, and our country has also proposed to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or more. This is a major peaceful competition between us and the major capitalist countries in the world. The fraternal friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union are an important guarantee for the victorious completion of this glorious historical task.
    On the occasion of celebrating the great festival of friendship and alliance between China and the Soviet Union, the people of our country sincerely thank the Soviet people for their great assistance to our country, and will continue to conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, accelerate the pace, and carry out socialist construction in our country. We will continuously strengthen the great fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union, continuously strengthen the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and strive for new victories in the common cause of world peace, human progress, and socialism.

### 永恒的同盟　和平的同盟

    永恒的同盟　和平的同盟
    今天是中苏两国八亿以上人民团结友好的伟大节日。八年前中苏两国政府签订了友好同盟互助条约，从此开始了中苏两个伟大社会主义国家友好团结的新阶段。在这个条约签订之后，毛泽东主席就曾说过：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”八年的历史，完全证明了中苏友好同盟的这种伟大意义。
    八年以来，中苏两国的友好关系不断加强，团结日益巩固。特别是在过去一年中，我们两国的友好团结又有了进一步的巨大发展。苏联最高苏维埃主席团伏罗希洛夫主席访问我国和毛泽东主席率领中华人民共和国代表团前往莫斯科参加伟大十月革命四十周年纪念，对于加强我们两国人民之间的友好团结，加强社会主义阵营之间的友好团结，都具有重大的意义。以阿里斯托夫同志为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团访问我国，在庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，以苏中友好协会主席安德烈耶夫同志为首的苏联各界代表团来到我国参加庆祝和我国劳动人民代表团等前往苏联参加庆祝，也对加强中苏两国人民的友好关系作出了可贵贡献。今年1月中苏两国签订的科学技术协定，又是中苏两国互助合作的一件大事。根据这个协定，苏联将对我国科学技术的发展提供巨大的援助。中苏两国人民越来越亲密的友好团结、互助合作，使这两个伟大社会主义国家日趋繁荣，使世界和平获得更加可靠的保障。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约是和平的条约。中苏两国的伟大兄弟同盟是世界和平的强大支柱。如果回顾一下过去八年的历史，我们就会清楚地看到，这个伟大的兄弟同盟在维护世界和平方面发挥了多么卓越的作用。中苏两国同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的政府和人民，以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，共同扑灭了以美国为首的帝国主义国家在朝鲜、印度支那的侵略战争。中苏两国人民一致支持了埃及人民反抗英、法、以三国的侵略的自卫战争，一致支持了叙利亚人民反抗美国的侵略阴谋，从而对保卫世界和平作了卓越的贡献。
    我们社会主义国家，从来就是主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处的。当社会主义阵营掌握了优势以后，我们不但没有利用我们的优势来威胁别人，相反地，是更加积极地为缓和国际紧张局势，促进世界和平而努力。去年12月以来，苏联政府提出了一系列的重大和平倡议，主张召开东西方国家最高级会议，立刻停止原子武器和核武器的试验，实现波兰提出的、捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国支持的在中欧建立无原子武器地区以及华沙条约成员国和北大西洋公约成员国签订互不侵犯条约等等。我国政府和人民完全支持苏联政府这些吸引人心的建议。最近，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、和平解决朝鲜问题的建议之后，我国政府完全支持这些建议并且声明将同朝鲜政府磋商撤退中国人民志愿军问题，以促使一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退，使朝鲜问题早日获得和平解决。所有这一切，都雄辩地证明了社会主义阵营各国一贯地坚决地奉行着和平外交政策。
    中国和苏联，同社会主义阵营其他各国一样，都在努力争取一个和平的国际环境，以便能够顺利地进行社会主义和共产主义的建设。在过去一年中，苏联人民在共产主义建设方面取得了巨大的成就。苏联卓著成效地实行了工业和建设管理制度的改组，使去年的工业产量大大超额完成；在按人口平均计算的肉类、奶类和油脂产量方面，也获得了突出的成绩。继建立了世界上第一个原子发电站之后，苏联又造成了世界上第一个原子破冰船和世界上第一批洲际弹道火箭。苏联成功地发射了两颗人造地球卫星，开辟了人类征服宇宙的新纪元。苏联人民这些光辉的成就，再一次向全世界表明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，给予建设社会主义各国人民、一切爱好和平人民以极大的鼓舞。
    在过去一年中，我国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设两条战线上都取得了重大的胜利。我国人民已经完成和超额完成了社会主义建设的第一个五年计划。目前，在我国全国范围内，出现了一个前所未有的争取在社会主义建设的各个战线上大跃进的高潮。在我国的社会主义建设过程中，苏联给予了我们伟大的全面的援助。到去年年底，苏联在我国第一个五年计划期间帮助我国建设的重大工程项目，已有五十七项全部建成，另有七项已部分建成并已投入生产。这对于我国在第一个五年计划期间奠定社会主义工业化基础起了巨大的作用。
    中苏两国人民同社会主义阵营各国人民一样，不仅一向主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处，而且完全相信，在社会主义和资本主义两种制度的和平竞赛中，社会主义制度必然胜利。最近，苏联已提出在十五年内在各种重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过美国，我国也提出在十五年或更多一些时间内在钢铁和其他重要的工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国。这是我们同世界上主要的资本主义国家进行的一场重大的和平竞赛。中苏两国人民兄弟般的友好团结和互助合作，是胜利完成这个光荣的历史任务的重要保证。
    在庆祝中苏两国友好同盟的伟大节日的时候，我国人民衷心地感谢苏联人民对我国的伟大援助，并将继续认真地学习苏联的先进经验，鼓足革命干劲，加快步伐，进行我国的社会主义建设。我们将不断地加强中苏两国的伟大兄弟同盟，不断地加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的伟大团结，争取世界和平、人类进步和社会主义的共同事业的新胜利。
