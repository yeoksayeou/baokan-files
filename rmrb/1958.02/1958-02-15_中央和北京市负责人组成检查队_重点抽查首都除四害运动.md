Xinhua News Agency, February 14th—A joint inspection team composed of central and Beijing Party, government, and military leaders conducted spot checks yesterday, February 14th, focusing on the situation of the "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" campaign, which the people of the capital began on February 1st before the Spring Festival.

    The results of the inspection show that through the large-scale campaign, the capital's "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" movement has taken a great leap forward. Except for a few factories where sanitation conditions are still relatively backward, many advanced units are even more advanced, and backward units have caught up with the advanced. "Four-no" areas and units (meaning no flies, no mosquitoes, no rats, no sparrows) in urban and suburban areas are constantly emerging.

    Minister of Public Health Li Dequan, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wang Kunlun, and others inspected the Fusui Jing residential area in Xisi District and units such as the Ministry of National Defense. The dozen or so residents in the Fusui Jing area that were inspected had clean and tidy rooms and courtyards. Li Dequan asked a four-year-old child, Han Mingzhi, what the four pests are and why they should be eliminated. Han Mingzhi clearly replied: flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows. He then said, "To prevent wasting food and prevent getting sick." Li Dequan repeatedly said, "Enough for a five, enough for a five." Li Dequan also encouraged the residents of this area to maintain and consolidate their existing achievements for thousands of years.

    Vice Minister of Higher Education Liu Aifeng, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, and Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee for Higher Education Song Shuo, among others, inspected Peking University and Beijing Medical College. Beijing Medical College, which had been criticized in the past for having all "four pests," was very tidy and clean indoors and outdoors, but Peking University's work in eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene was not thorough enough. Wu Han hoped that Peking University would learn from Beijing Medical College.

    Gong Zirong, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central Government Organs, and Vice Mayors of Beijing Jia Tingsan, and Le Songsheng, among others, inspected some government organs, factories, and shopping malls.

    More than eighty central and Beijing Party, government, and military leaders participated in today's inspection, inspecting more than eighty government organs, factories, schools, military units, residential areas, food and beverage industries, and so on. Factories such as the Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing were criticized by the inspection team for their poor sanitation conditions.

    中央和北京市负责人组成检查队
    重点抽查首都除四害运动
    新华社14日讯　由中央和北京市的党、政、军负责人组成的联合检查队14日重点抽查了首都人民从2月1日开始的春节前除四害、讲卫生大突击的情况。
    检查的结果表明：通过大突击，首都人民的除四害、讲卫生运动大大向前跃进了一步。除少数工厂的卫生情况仍较落后外，许多先进单位更加先进，落后的单位已经赶上先进，城郊的“四无”地区和单位不断涌现。
    卫生部部长李德全、北京市副市长王昆仑等检查了西四区福绥境居民区和国防部等单位。受检查的福绥境十几户居民，室内室外都窗明几净，整齐清洁。李德全问一个四岁的孩子韩明志四害是什么？为什么除四害？韩明志清楚地回答说：苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀。接着说，“省得糟蹋粮食，省得得病。”李德全连声说：“够五分，够五分。”李德全并勉励这个地区的居民们千年如一日，坚持和巩固现有的成绩。
    高等教育部副部长刘皑风、北京市副市长吴晗和中共北京市委高校党委副书记宋硕等检查了北京大学和北京医学院。过去因“四害”俱全受到批评的北京医学院室内室外都很整齐清洁，但北京大学的除四害、讲卫生工作做得却不够彻底。吴晗希望北京大学向北京医学院学习。
    中共中央国家机关委员会书记龚子荣，北京市副市长贾庭三、乐松生等检查了一些机关、工厂和商场。
    参加今天检查的中央和北京市的党、政、军负责人共八十多人，检查了八十多个机关、工厂、学校、部队、居民区、饮食行业等。北京市清河制呢厂等工厂由于卫生情况不好，受到了检查组的批评。
