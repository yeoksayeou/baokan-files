The meeting gave us unparalleled encouragement from the very beginning, because the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo at the meeting summarized the victorious completion and over-fulfillment of China's First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and highlighted the financial and construction arrangements for the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. In addition to expressing my support, I would like to point out that these two reports vividly reflect how our motherland, in all aspects of industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, education, and health, is advancing at an unprecedented speed under the selfless labor of the people across the country. The call made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer has pointed out an arduous and glorious struggle goal for the industrial sector. The call for water conservancy construction issued by the Agricultural Development Program has prompted the irrigated area to reach half of what had been accumulated in the past four thousand years in just four months. The completion of the Yangtze River Bridge has rendered the natural barrier, which was historically a strategic point for military strategists, ineffective. The opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has turned the lament about the difficulty of the Shu Road into history. The nationwide movement to eliminate the four pests and prevent diseases is transforming the backward state of sanitation in our country. All of this proves that the great motherland is not only advancing but is also leaping forward.

China's scientific undertakings have entered a new era of the leap forward. The Party and the government have made proper arrangements for overall planning and unified leadership. The planning and comprehensiveness of socialist science will be greatly brought into play.

This new situation of the leap forward is also present in China's scientific undertakings. The "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has opened up unlimited prospects for academic development. This policy encourages free debate and specific practice, so that the correct parts and new things in a discipline can be developed through the unity of contradictions, thereby improving and enriching the content of this academic field. This policy starts from dialectical materialism, and the proletarian materialist worldview is the only correct viewpoint for revealing the mysteries of nature. Therefore, the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy not only plays a huge role in specifically leading academics, but also provides conditions for a leap forward in the work of eliminating bourgeois idealism. The formulation of the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Development Plan Outline has given China's scientific undertakings a historical document with the same effect as the Constitution, marking a milestone in the history of China's scientific development. The success of formulating the scientific plan powerfully shows that exploratory scientific research can and should be carried out according to plan. In fact, a characteristic of socialist science is its planning nature. Therefore, the completion of the formulation of the Twelve-Year Science Plan marks a major leap forward in China's scientific undertakings. Overall planning and unified leadership are two necessary factors to ensure the smooth completion of undertakings. Our Party and the government have also made proper arrangements in terms of unified leadership. A Scientific Planning Commission has been established under the State Council, and the role of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as the "locomotive" in academic leadership has also been clarified. Following these deployments, specialized academies of sciences, such as the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, have been established one after another. In provincial-level organs, scientific undertakings are led by the Science Work Committee. Fujian Province set up this kind of institution as early as September of last year. In addition, the Academic Committee, as the grassroots leadership institution in various research units, has also formed a new system. Thus, a complete administrative and academic leadership system from the central government to the grassroots has been established. This is a world of difference from the decentralized and chaotic state before liberation, presenting a healthy new scene. Another characteristic of socialist science is its comprehensiveness. The success of the Soviet Union in launching two artificial satellites fully demonstrates the superiority of comprehensive research. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the comprehensive survey teams of natural resources and natural conditions organized and participated in by the Chinese Academy of Sciences carried out a lot of work in the Yellow River and Heilongjiang River basins, in the tropical and subtropical Yunnan and South China, and in the vast Xinjiang region. They accumulated a lot of data on resource development and established a good foundation for comprehensive research for the new China's science. In order to cultivate new forces and strengthen our scientific contingent, graduate student systems have been established in the Academy of Sciences and universities. In order to train scientific cadres in China's blank and weak disciplines, the government has sent a large number of advanced students to study in the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. In improving the necessary scientific working conditions, under the leadership of the Science Planning Commission, the preparatory work for the establishment of a central library and the improvement work for the production, repair, and supply of instruments and chemical reagents are being actively carried out, thereby changing China's past dependence on imports. In terms of publishing, the Chinese Academy of Sciences alone published 95 scientific journals during the First Five-Year Plan period, totaling more than 150 million words, with a circulation of 12 million copies. Popular science work was not valued in the era of reactionary rule, but thanks to the efforts of our Science and Technology Popularization Association, the work of imparting scientific knowledge to the people has been greatly expanded. Finally, in terms of international scientific cooperation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Sciences first cooperated in 1955 to conduct a comprehensive survey of biological resources in Yunnan. At the end of 1957, a five-year scientific cooperation agreement was signed between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences. The scientific cooperation agreement with the Polish Academy of Sciences is also being implemented. The above does not include the achievements of scientific research in the past five years, but it is enough to show that China's scientific undertakings, like other undertakings, have entered a new era of the leap forward. These achievements could only have occurred under the leadership of the Party. When the rightists frantically attacked the Party last year, they repeatedly spread the fallacy that "laymen cannot lead experts." Iron facts repelled their attacks. Iron facts further show that under the leadership of the Party, China's scientific undertakings are not only advancing but are also leaping forward.

The new situation puts forward new requirements, and the ideological remolding of intellectuals must also leap forward. The current work of sending cadres to lower levels nationwide is a great opportunity for intellectuals to intensify their training and strive for a leap forward in ideological remolding.

The new situation in the progress of China's scientific undertakings puts forward new requirements for us old intellectuals engaged in scientific work: to adapt to the new situation, and ideological remolding must also leap forward. Faced with this requirement, some people say: "Ideological remolding is a long-term task, even the Communist Party says so. Is it realistic to ask for a leap forward? Can it be achieved?" Ideological remolding is indeed a long-term task, but "long-term" should be regarded as "constant" improvement, not as an excuse for "slow progress" or "passive waiting." Everyone knows that the basic key to ideological remolding lies in taking a firm stand and following the socialist road. In the anti-rightist struggle, the necessity of following the socialist road has been clarified. If we can resolve every specific problem in accordance with the interests of the 600 million people on the basis of this theoretical understanding, it shows that ideological remolding has been effective. We old intellectuals once lived in a bourgeois society, received a bourgeois education, and were infected with bourgeois individualism. Although we have participated in social reform movements under the care and education of the Party, and our thinking has indeed undergone many changes, bourgeois individualism is still reflected in the question of the purpose of scientific research work in this rectification movement. Denying that the basic task of scientific research is to develop production and build socialism, and simply emphasizing personal expertise; denying that the fundamental source of knowledge is the practice of human production and class struggle, and only emphasizing the development of disciplines without being willing to study the problems raised by production, are all unconsciously embarking on the anti-socialist road. If we can take a firm stand on these specific issues, do everything for the people, and do everything for socialism, then such ideological remolding deserves the title of leap forward, because it takes a great effort to jump eight feet high to extricate oneself from deep-rooted individualism.

Since a leap forward in ideological remolding is possible, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have made specific arrangements for intellectuals to promote this kind of leap forward. The current nationwide work of sending cadres to lower levels is the best opportunity for intellectuals to train themselves through labor, and it also creates the best conditions for a leap forward in ideological remolding. Going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, entering factories and going down to the mines, is the only way to directly appreciate the great significance of production practice. It is the necessary process to appreciate that theory cannot be separated from practice, and that practice requires theory. It is a rare occasion to learn the noble revolutionary qualities of the working class and peasants—organization, militancy, and realism. The arrogance of bourgeois intellectuals is first manifested in their contempt for physical labor and the working people, which further develops into elevating their own disciplines and attacking other people's disciplines, and further develops into believing that they are superior to others in the same industry and claiming to be omnipotent leaders. The arrogance of bourgeois intellectuals is the main reason for undermining unity and hindering collective work. Recognizing the wisdom of the workers and peasants, experiencing the glory of physical labor, seeing one's own insignificance in the face of the collective, seeing the power of unity, and realizing the incompetence of the individual, is obviously the most effective factor in promoting a leap forward in ideological remolding.

The country's economic and cultural construction has entered an era of the leap forward, and our ideological remolding work of intellectuals must catch up. We are determined not to be left behind. I believe that under the kind care and strong leadership of the Party, our intellectuals will follow the working class and peasant masses and create a great leap forward on the ideological construction front.

    科学事业正在跃进
    思想建设必须赶上
    刘崇乐代表的发言
    这次会议一开始就给了我们无比的鼓舞，因为李先念、薄一波两位副总理在会议上所作的报告总结了我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划胜利完成和超额完成的情况，提示了第二个五年计划头一年的财政和建设的安排。我除表示拥护外，愿意指出这两项报告十分生动地反映出，我们祖国无论在工业、农业、交通运输、文教卫生各个方面，如何在全国人民的忘我劳动下，以空前的速度向前迈进。党中央和毛主席提出的在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召，已为工业界指出了艰巨而光荣的奋斗目标；农业发展纲要发出的兴修水利的号召，已促使灌溉面积在短短四个月内达到四千年来所积累的一半。长江大桥的建成，已使自古兵家必争的天堑失去作用；宝成铁路的通车，又使蜀道难的感叹成为过去。全民性的除四害防疾病的运动正在使我国卫生落后的面貌焕然一新。这一切都证明伟大的祖国不仅在前进而是在跃进。
    我国科学事业已进入跃进的新时代，党和政府对全面规划和统一领导作了妥善的安排，社会主义科学的计划性和综合性将要大大发挥作用。
    这种跃进的新形势也呈现在我国科学事业方面。党中央和毛主席所提出的百家争鸣政策，为学术发展开辟了无限的前途。这个政策鼓励自由争辩和具体实践，使得一门学科里正确的部分和新生的东西，通过矛盾的统一，得到发展，从而健全与丰富这门学术的内容。这个政策是从辩证唯物主义出发的，而无产阶级唯物主义的世界观又正是揭露自然界奥秘的唯一正确观点。因此，百家争鸣政策不仅在具体领导学术上发挥着巨大作用，也为肃清资产阶级唯心主义一项工作提供了跃进的条件。十二年科学技术远景发展规划纲要的制订，给了我国科学事业一个与宪法有同等作用的历史文件，是我国科学发展史上的一个里程碑。制订科学规划的成功，有力地说明了探索性的科学研究工作是可以也应该按计划来进行。实际上，社会主义科学的一个特点就是它的计划性，因而十二年科学规划的制订完成，标志着我国科学事业的一个大跃进。全面规划与统一领导是保证事业顺利完成的两个必要因素，我们党和政府在统一领导方面又作了妥善的安排。在国务院设立了科学规划委员会，同时也明确了中国科学院在学术领导方面的“火车头”的作用。随着这些部署，专业性的科学院，例如医学科学院、农业科学院，相继成立。在省级机关中，科学事业由科学工作委员会负责领导，福建省并已于去年九月即设置这种机构。此外，在各个研究单位内，作为基层领导机构的学术委员会，也形成了一种新制度。就这样一个完整的从中央到基层的行政与学术的领导系统建立起来，这与解放以前各自为政分散混乱的状态真有天渊之别，呈现出一片健康的新景象。社会主义科学的另一特点是它的综合性，苏联发射两颗人造卫星的成功最充分地说明综合研究的优越性。在第一个五年计划期间，中国科学院所组织和参加的自然资源和自然条件综合考察队在黄河与黑龙江流域，在热带亚热带的云南和华南，在广大的新疆地区进行了不少工作，积累了不少有关开发资源的资料，也为新中国的科学建立了综合研究的良好基础。为了培养新生力量，壮大我们的科学队伍。在科学院和高等学校都建立了研究生制度。又为了培养我国空白和薄弱学科的科学干部，政府派遣了大批进修人员留学苏联和其它兄弟国家。在改善必要的科学工作条件方面，在科学规划委员会的领导下，成立中心图书馆的筹备工作，生产、修配和供应仪器和化学试剂的改进工作都在积极进行中，从而改变我国过去依赖进口的情况。在出版方面，仅中国科学院，在第一个五年计划期间，所出版的科学期刊即有九十五种，共一亿五千多万字，发行量一千二百万册。科学普及工作在反动统治时代是不受重视的，但在我们的科学技术普及协会的努力下，把科学知识交给人民的工作已经大大展开。最后，在国际科学合作方面，中国科学院与苏联科学院在一九五五年首次合作进行了云南生物资源综合考察的工作。在一九五七年年底又签订了中苏两国科学院为期五年的科学合作协定。同波兰科学院的科学合作协定也在继续执行中。以上所述还不包括五年来科学研究的成果在内，但已足够说明我国的科学事业，就同其它事业一样，已经进入一个跃进的新时代。这些成就只有在党的领导下才能出现。去年右派分子们猖狂地向党进攻的时候，他们一再放出“外行不能领导内行”的谬论。铁的事实击退了他们的进攻。铁的事实更说明了在党的领导下，我国的科学事业不只在前进而是在跃进。
    新形势提出了新要求，知识分子的思想改造也要跃进，目前全国范围内的干部下放工作，正是知识分子加紧锻炼争取思想改造跃进的大好机会。
    我国科学事业进展的新形势，对我们从事科学工作的旧知识分子提出了新要求：适应新形势，思想改造也要跃进。面对这个要求，有的人说：“思想改造是个长期工作，连共产党都这么说，要求跃进是否现实呢？能否实现呢？”思想改造的确是个长期的工作，不过“长期”应当被认作“经常不断”的提高，而不是“迟步缓进”或“消极等待”的借口。大家知道，思想改造的基本关键在于站稳立场，走社会主义的道路。在反右斗争中，走社会主义的道路的必要性已经明确了，如果我们在这个理论认识的基础上，每逢具体问题，都能解决得符合六亿人民的利益，那就说明思想改造已见成效。我们旧知识分子曾经生活在资产阶级的社会里，受到过资产阶级的教育，沾染了资产阶级的个人主义，虽然在党的关怀教育下参加过历次的社会改革运动，思想上确已起了不少变化，但在这次整改运动中，资产阶级个人主义仍然反映在科学研究工作的目的性的问题上。否认科学研究的基本任务是发展生产建设社会主义而单纯强调个人的专长，否认知识的根本源泉是人的生产实践和阶级斗争的实践而一味强调发展学科也不愿研究由生产提出的问题，都是不自觉地走上了反社会主义的道路。如果我们能够在这些具体问题上坚定立场，一切为人民，一切为社会主义，那么这样的思想改造就当得起跃进的称号，因为从根深蒂固的个人主义自拔出来，是需要用跳起一丈八尺高的大气力。
    思想改造的跃进既属可能，党中央和毛主席为了促进这类的跃进又为知识分子作了具体的安排。当前全国范围内轰轰烈烈展开的干部下放工作，对知识分子说来是一个最好的从劳动中锻炼自己的机会，也是为跃进式的改造思想所创造最好的条件。上山下乡进厂入矿是直接体会生产实践伟大意义的唯一的途径，是体会理论不能脱离实际而实践又必需理论的必经的过程，是向工农群众学习他们的高尚革命品质——组织性，斗争性，现实性——的难逢的场合。资产阶级知识分子的妄自尊大首先表现在鄙视体力劳动鄙视劳动人民，进一步发展到抬高自己的学科打击别人的学科，更进一步发展到在同行中自认为高人一等自封为万能领导。资产阶级知识分子的自高自大是破坏团结和阻碍集体工作的主要原因。认识到工农群众的智慧，体验到体力劳动的光荣，在集体的面前看清了自己的渺小，看团结的力量觉悟到个体的无能，这显然对跃进式的思想改造是一个最有效的促成因素。
    全国的经济文化建设都已转入跃进的时代，我们知识分子的思想改造工作必须迎头赶上。我们是决不甘愿掉队的。我相信我们知识分子在党的亲切关怀和坚强领导之下，一定会追随工农劳动群众之后，在思想建设战线上也来一个大跃进。
