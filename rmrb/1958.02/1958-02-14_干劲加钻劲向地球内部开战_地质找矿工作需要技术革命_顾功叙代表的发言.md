The booming developments on all economic construction fronts of the motherland heard at this conference, especially the vivid examples from farmer representatives, and the overwhelming momentum of production, truly fill the people of the whole country with confidence and hope for our great and bright future. In terms of industrial construction, catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in the production of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, and striving for leap after leap, are all encouraging. As a natural science worker, how can one remain indifferent in such a heroic and surging atmosphere? How scientific work should coordinate with this development and strive to be a promoter in the country's socialist construction is a question that should be deeply considered.

Vice Premier Bo mentioned in his report that in our country's agricultural construction, we have already seen the beginning of a great technological revolution. I think other aspects will inevitably have the same prospect. Here, I intend to make a speech to the conference on the issue of technological revolution in geological prospecting work.

In the past nine years, a large number of mineral deposits have been discovered. Most of the elements listed on the periodic table exist in our country, and the reserves of several types rank first in the world, proving that our country possesses all the mineral raw materials to guarantee industrial construction. However, the output is far from meeting the needs of the country's long-term construction.

Since the liberation of the whole country, in the short nine years, the growth rate of proven reserves of various mineral resources in our country has indeed exceeded all imagination. Not only has the reserves of each mineral species increased significantly, but also many mineral species that were previously thought to be unlikely to exist in large quantities in China have been discovered in large quantities. The most illustrative of this fact is copper ore. As for the other elements listed on the periodic table (natural ones), whether rare or radioactive, they have been found successively, more or less. The proven reserves of several minerals have indeed ranked first in the world. Therefore, we can now say without exaggerating that our country has minerals of most elements in the periodic table and many minerals with special industrial uses, such as piezoelectric quartz and diamonds. This guarantees all the mineral raw materials needed for the country's long-term construction of a complete industrial system in the future. These achievements can also be used as another basis for us to be full of confidence and hope for the future of national socialist construction.

Nevertheless, the task before geological prospecting workers is still very arduous. Because although some mineral species have been discovered, the amount is still far from meeting the needs of the country's construction in the long term, such as chromium, nickel, and petroleum. And for some mineral species, although the quantity is large, the regional distribution is uneven. For example, there is less coal in the south of the Yangtze River. In addition to being sufficient for the current design and construction projects, the reserves of mineral raw material bases must also consider the demand for mineral raw materials for new construction projects within several decades, so as to provide a resource basis for the country to arrange a longer-term overall construction plan. In addition, also because of our large population, if each person consumes 100 kilograms of oil per year, then 60 million tons need to be produced annually. Therefore, the amount of minerals is never too much, and it is still absolutely necessary to discover more mineral resources. From the above situations, geological prospecting work in our country should definitely exert full energy and actively create more and better mineral resource conditions for national socialist construction.

Handicraft-style prospecting methods are gradually losing their effectiveness. Technological revolution has become an important link in further discovering minerals. Geological science and geophysics science workers must shoulder the great task of uncovering the secrets of the earth's interior.

As for a very important link in the work of further discovering minerals, it is how to develop new technologies, that is, to use the latest achievements in science to carry out the technological revolution in geological prospecting work. It is not difficult for us to imagine that underground mineral sources are becoming less and less. Some minerals that can be seen exposed on the surface with the naked eye will gradually decrease, and even be completely found. What remains are minerals that are buried deeper and cannot be seen, or exposed in remote mountain and desolate areas where people cannot currently reach. Therefore, relying solely on the handicraft-style prospecting methods of searching with eyes and climbing with legs will gradually lose its effectiveness, although it is still very common to do so and can also find minerals. If we look a little further, we will find that we must develop new scientific and technological methods to compensate for the deficiencies of the old technologies, in order to explore these minerals that are not easy to discover.

Geophysical exploration work is a new prospecting technology developed with this intention. This new work has been initially established in our country with the assistance of the Soviet Union, and has played an important role in finding minerals in recent years. Generally speaking, it is welcomed and supported by the majority of geological personnel. Of course, it is also inevitable that there are individual cases where there is insufficient understanding of the new technology, and there is some resistance in thinking, feeling that they can still find minerals without it. They are accustomed to the old, mature methods, and have not seen the future from development. Geological prospecting work, like agriculture and all other undertakings, is no exception. It must constantly undergo technological innovations of all sizes, and it is impossible to permanently remain on some mature working methods. This is an unchangeable objective law.

Today, advanced socialist science is pushing mankind's several great ideals—flying to interstellar space and the use of unlimited amounts of atomic energy—towards realization. Our geological science and geophysics science workers should also have this kind of ambition to embrace such a grand ideal, which is to uncover the secrets of the earth's interior.

Human beings know very little about the interior of the earth. The deepest drillings in the world are only five or six kilometers, while the radius of the earth is six thousand three hundred kilometers.

It is strange to say that although human scientific knowledge is sufficient to enter the nucleus of the atom to understand the situation, and industrial technology is sufficient to put artificial satellites into flight at an altitude of one thousand kilometers, we know very little about the interior of the earth where we live and which is closely related to us, and are almost ignorant. Using modern drilling technology to obtain underground data with relatively little effort can only reach a depth of 300 to 500 meters. Drilling above 1,000 meters (1 kilometer) is complicated and cannot be carried out arbitrarily. The deepest drillings in the world do not exceed five to six kilometers. Comparing this depth with the earth's radius of six thousand three hundred kilometers can only show that the situation of the earth's interior that we humans can currently grasp is limited to its extremely thin skin layer, which is exactly the thin layer in which most of the minerals that humans are using today are stored. Furthermore, this thin layer has a large area, and more detailed knowledge is limited to the vicinity of the mining area. In most of the area, it is impossible to obtain drilling data.

Attacking the interior of the earth should start from two aspects: one is to develop deeper, and the other is to expand the area.

Geological science and geophysics science workers have the responsibility to use all scientific and technological achievements to gradually clarify the situation of the earth's interior, obtain more detailed knowledge, and extract more useful minerals from the earth to serve mankind. The strategy of attacking the interior of the earth should start from two aspects: first, advancing to deeper depths; second, expanding the area.

(1) To go deeper, we must rely on geophysics and study and create effective methods to obtain detailed underground data from depths deeper than what current drilling can reach. Soviet scientists are studying the use of artificial seismic waves generated by explosions to understand the structure and properties of the earth's crust at depths of tens of kilometers, and have obtained important knowledge. They have long begun to explore the possibility of using the achievements of nuclear physics to study the interior of the earth and find minerals, and experiments in drilling have yielded very meaningful results. In addition, it is also necessary to study and invent easy drilling methods, requiring lightweight, high-efficiency, low-cost mechanical equipment that can reach great depths.

(2) To expand the area, we must rely on airborne exploration technology, advance to areas with inconvenient transportation and where people cannot reach with extremely high work efficiency. We must study and invent geophysical methods and instruments based on various principles to record data in the air that is meaningful for understanding geological conditions and finding minerals. Our country has a vast territory, and two-thirds of it is mountainous, so more attention should be paid to the development in this area.

In this way, under the close combination of geological science and geophysics science, and equipped with the latest science and technology, this battle against nature can begin. This is a long struggle process, and it can only be said that we have just taken the first step. The task of directly participating in the battle has already fallen on every geological and geophysics science worker. We are in this great era, with the incomparable superiority of the socialist system as a guarantee for victory in the battle; with assistance from the most advanced science and technology from the great fraternal Soviet Union; and with the care and support from the Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country for the development of all scientific undertakings. We are confident that we can muster revolutionary drive, and on the basis of continuously improving socialist ideological awareness, strive to study our profession hard, and ensure that we play a promoting role in the cause of revealing the secrets of the earth's interior and searching for greater amounts of underground treasures.

    干劲加钻劲向地球内部开战
    地质找矿工作需要技术革命
    顾功叙代表的发言
    在这次大会上所听到的祖国在各个经济建设战线上，许多蓬勃发展的情况，特别是来自农民代表方面的生动事例，排山倒海的生产劲头，确使全国人民对我们伟大光辉的未来，充满信心，充满希望。在工业建设方面，要在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国，争取跃进再跃进，都是值得鼓舞的。作为一个自然科学工作者，处在这样豪迈高涨的气氛中，怎能无动于中。科学工作如何配合这种发展，争取做国家社会主义建设事业中的促进派，确是应该深深思考的问题。
    薄副总理在报告中提到，在我国的农业建设方面已经看到要开始走向一个伟大的技术革命，我想其他方面也必然会有同样的前景。在这里企图就地质找矿工作中的技术革命问题，向大会作一个发言。
    九年来发现了大量矿藏，元素周期表上所列的绝大多数元素我国都有，而且有几种储量确占世界首位，证明我国拥有保证工业建设的一切矿物原料。但产量远不能满足国家长期建设的需要。
    全国解放以来，短短的九年之中，我国在各种矿产资源探明储量的增长速度，确是超越了人们的一切想像。不但每个矿种的蕴藏量有了巨大的增长，就是有许多矿种过去认为中国不大可能有很多的，也已被大量发现了。最可说明这一事实的是铜矿。至于元素周期表上所列的其他元素（天然的），不论是稀有的或是放射性的，都陆续地或多或少找到了。有几个矿种，目前探明的储量，确实已居世界首位。因此现在我们可以不致夸大事实地说，我们国家具有元素周期表中绝大多数种元素的矿物和很多种有特殊工业用途的矿物如压电石英、金刚石之类。这就保证了今后国家在长期建设完整的工业体系的过程中所需要的一切矿物原料。这些成就也可以用来作为我们对国家社会主义建设的前途，充满信心，充满希望另一方面的根据。
    虽然如此，放在地质找矿工作者面前的任务还是十分艰巨的。因为有些矿种虽已发现，但矿量还很不能满足长时期内国家建设的要求，例如铬、镍、石油之类。而有些矿种，量虽多但地区分布不平衡，例如长江以南，煤比较少。矿物原料基地的储量，除了够目前设计建设项目之用，还必须想到几十年以内新建设项目对矿物原料的要求，才能为国家安排较远的整体建设规划提出资源依据。此外，也由于我国人多，每人如每年消耗一百公斤的石油，每年就需要生产六千万吨。所以矿量总是不会嫌太多的，发现更多的矿物资源还是完全有必要。从以上种种情况来看，我国的地质找矿工作肯定也应该鼓足干劲，积极地为国家社会主义建设创造出更多更好的矿物资源条件。
    手工业式找矿方法，逐渐要失去作用。技术革命已成为进一步发现矿产的重要环节，地质科学和地球物理科学工作者，必须担负起揭开地球内部秘密的伟大任务。
    至于进一步发现矿产的工作中一个极重要的环节，是如何发展新技术，就是利用科学上的最新成就来进行地质找矿工作的技术革命。我们不难设想地下矿源是愈找愈少的，一些凭借肉眼能见到露出地表的，会逐渐少起来，甚至被找完了。余留下来的都是埋藏较深见不到的矿，或是露出在目前人迹还不能到达的深山绝境地带。因此单凭两眼找，两腿爬的手工业式找矿方法，逐渐会失去作用，尽管目前还很普遍地这样做，并且也能找到矿。如果我们稍向远处着眼就会发觉必须发展新的科学技术来补旧技术的缺陷，以探寻这种不易发现的矿。
    地球物理勘探工作就是在这种意图上发展起来的找矿新技术，这门新工作在苏联的援助下，在我国已经初步建立起来，几年之中已发挥了重要的找矿作用。一般来说，是受到广大地质人员的欢迎与支持，其中当然也不能避免有个别情况，对新技术认识不足，在思想上有些抵触，感到没有也会找到矿。习惯于旧的成熟的一套，并没有从发展看到今后。地质找矿工作和农业及一切其他事业，都不能例外，要不断经历技术上大大小小的革新，不可能永恒地停留在一些成熟的工作方法上。这是无可改变的客观规律。
    当今，先进的社会主义科学，正在把人类的几种大理想——飞往星际和无限大量原子能的利用，推向实现。我们地质科学和地球物理科学工作者应该也具备这种气魄来怀抱这样一个远大的理想，就是要揭开地球内部的秘密。
    人类对地球内部的情况知道得很少，世界上最深钻井不过五、六公里，而地球半径是六千三百公里。
    说来很可奇，尽管人类的科学知识已经足够用来进入原子的核去了解情况。工业技术已经足够把人造卫星放到一千公里的高空去飞行，但是对于我们生存所在，休戚相关的地球内部，反而知道得很少，简直接近于无知。利用现代钻井技术比较少费事地取得地下资料，只能到达三百至五百公尺的深处，一千公尺（1公里）以上的钻井，工程就复杂了，不能随意进行。世界上最深的钻井也不超过五至六公里。以这种深度来和地球的半径六千三百公里相比拟，只能说明我们人类目前所可能掌握的地球内部情况，只局限于其表面极其微薄的皮肤层之内，正是今天人类已在利用的大多数矿产所蕴藏的薄层。再说这个薄层面积很大，比较详细的知识，又只限于矿区附近，在绝大部分的面积上，就不可能取得钻井资料。    向地球内部进攻应从两方面着手：一是向深处发展，二是面的扩大。
    地质科学和地球物理科学工作者都有责任利用一切科学技术上的成就来逐步弄清楚地球内部的情况，取得更详细的知识，向地球索取更多的有益矿物为人类服务。向地球内部进攻的策略，应该从两方面着手：第一，是向深处进占；第二，是面的扩大。
    （1）向深处，就要依靠地球物理，研究创造有效的方法来取得比目前钻井能到达深度更深处的详细地下资料。苏联科学家正研究利用爆炸所发生的人工地震波动来了解数十公里深处地壳的结构与性质，取得了重要的知识。他们早已开始试探利用原子核物理学上的成就，作为研究地球内部和找矿的可能性，在钻井中的试验，已获得了极有意义的结果。另外，也必须研究发明轻而易举的钻井方法，要求机械设备轻便，效率高，成本低，达到的深度大。
    （2）面的扩大，就要依靠航空勘探技术，以极高度的工作效率，向交通不便，人迹不到的地区进军，必须研究发明各种原理的地球物理方法和仪器，在空中记录对了解地质情况和找矿有意义的资料。我国领域广大，而有三分之二是高山区，因此这方面的发展更应注意。
    这样，在地质科学和地球物理科学的紧密结合下，再配备上最新的科学技术，这场向大自然斗争的战役才有可能开始。这是一个漫长的斗争过程，现在只可说刚走上第一步。直接参与战斗的任务已经落到了每一个地质和地球物理科学工作者的身上。我们处在这个伟大的时代，有无比优越的社会主义制度作为战斗胜利的保证；有来自伟大苏联友邦最先进科学技术上的援助；有中央和毛主席及全国人民对发展一切科学事业的关怀和支持。确信自己能够鼓足革命干劲，并且在不断提高社会主义思想觉悟的基础上，努力钻研业务，保证在揭穿地球内部的秘密，搜寻出更大量的地下宝藏的事业中发挥促进派的作用。
