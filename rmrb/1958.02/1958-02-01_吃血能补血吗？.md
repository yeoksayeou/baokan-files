In China, there's a very common traditional belief about food, which is that eating a certain part of an animal can replenish the corresponding part of your own body. For example, eating beef bone marrow is said to replenish bone marrow, eating meat helps you grow meat, and so on. The idea that eating blood replenishes blood is one of these traditional beliefs.

In fact, not only do ordinary people believe that eating blood replenishes blood, but many ancient Chinese physicians also held this view. For example, Chen Zangqi, a medical scientist of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, wrote in his "Ben Cao Shi Yi" (Supplement to Materia Medica) that various animal bloods can "replenish deficiencies in human blood, or treat blood depletion. For skin eruptions and pale complexions, all indicate insufficiency and should be treated with raw blood." Judging from the symptoms described, the blood depletion and blood insufficiency mentioned here are what modern medicine calls anemia. It can be seen that the idea of using blood to replenish blood has a history of at least a thousand years. Not only was animal blood used as medicine, but it also developed to the point of using human blood. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" even contains prescriptions using human blood as medicine.

Among modern physicians, there have also been similar views. They believed that human blood contains iron, and animal blood also contains iron. They mistakenly believed that the organic iron compounds in animal blood are easily absorbed and used to supply blood production, while inorganic iron compounds are not easily absorbed and utilized. Therefore, they also concluded that eating animal blood can replenish blood.

However, these views have been proven incorrect by experimental research in recent years. Regarding the iron needed for blood production, the organic iron contained in animal and plant foods is not only not superior to artificially produced inorganic iron, but is actually inferior to inorganic iron. Inorganic iron can be absorbed by the digestive tract and is even more easily absorbed than organic iron compounds. As for the iron in animal hemoglobin, it cannot be absorbed at all, and after eating it, it is still excreted in the feces. Therefore, if anemia patients try to replenish blood by eating animal blood, it will be of no avail. Of course, it is perfectly acceptable to use animal blood to make food, such as using chicken blood to make hot and sour soup, or using pig blood with tofu to stir-fry red and white tofu. Although the iron in animal blood is not easily utilized by the human body, the protein it contains has certain nutritional value. Therefore, using animal blood as food is still beneficial and harmless, but you cannot rely on it to replenish blood.

When suffering from iron-deficiency anemia, the most effective way is to take preparations of inorganic iron compounds, such as reduced iron, ferrous sulfate, ferrous lactate, etc., which are all very effective. Blood tonic pills sold by pharmaceutical companies are made from this type of medicine.

Perhaps some people will ask: Directly transfusing human whole blood or plasma into a patient's blood vessels does have a high blood-replenishing effect. Why can't eating animal blood replenish blood? This is because directly transfusing blood and eating blood have completely different processes. The two cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

### 吃血能补血吗？

　　吃血能补血吗？
　　邓宗禹
    我国民间，对于食品有个很普遍的传统看法，认为吃了动物身上某一部分东西，就可以补自己身上某一部分，如说吃牛骨髓可以补骨髓，吃肉可以长肉，等等。吃血补血，也是这种传统的说法之一。
    其实，不止民间有吃血补血的看法，我国古代医学家持有这种见解的也颇不乏人。例如唐朝开元时代的医学家陈藏器，在所著本草拾遗里就有诸血能“补人身血不足，或患血枯。皮上肤起，面无颜色者，皆不足也。并宜生饮”的记载。从所述症状上看来，这里所说的血枯和血不足，也就是现代医学所说的贫血，可见用血补血的主张至少已有千年以上的历史了。不但动物血曾经被当作药物使用，而且还曾发展到应用人的血液。本草纲目里就载有用人的血液作药的处方。
    在近代医学家中，也曾经有过类似的看法。他们以为人的血液里有铁的成份，动物血液也含有铁质，误认为动物血中的有机铁化合物容易被吸收来供给造血之用，无机铁化合物不易被吸收利用，所以也得出了吃动物血可以补血的结论来。
    这些看法经过近些年来的实验研究，证明并不正确。从供给造血所需要的铁质来说，动物性和植物性食品里所含的有机铁，不但不优于人工制造的无机铁，而且不如无机铁。无机铁质不但可以为消化道所吸收，并且比有机铁化合物更容易被吸收。至于动物血红素中的铁质，更是不能被吸收的，吃下去以后，仍然随着粪便排出体外。所以贫血病患者如果企图用吃动物血的办法来补血，是无济于事的。当然，利用动物血制作食品，如用鸡血做酸辣汤，用猪血配上豆腐炒红白豆腐等，完全是可以的。因为动物血里的铁质虽然不易为人体所利用，但其中所含的蛋白质等，却有一定的营养价值。所以用动物血作食品，还是有益无损的，只是不能依靠它来补血罢了。
    遇到患缺铁性贫血时，最有效的办法是服用无机铁化合物的制剂，如还元铁、硫酸亚铁、乳酸亚铁等，效力都很好。医药公司出售的补血丸，就是以这一类药品为原料的。
    或许有人会问：把人的全血或血浆直接给病人输入血管，确实有很高的补血效力，为什么吃动物血就不能补血呢？这是因为直接输血同把血液吃下肚去，它们经过的过程完全不同，两者不能相提并论。
