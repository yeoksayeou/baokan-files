　　Promoting the Consolidation of Agricultural Cooperatives and the Great Leap Forward in Production
　　Sichuan Accelerates the Development of Collective Sideline Occupations
　　This newspaper's special dispatch from Chengdu by Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Zongtang: Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan have decided this year to accelerate the development of collective sideline occupations to change the current situation where the production of collective sideline occupations is not adapted to agricultural production, thereby further improving and consolidating the cooperatives. The province plans to strive to make collective sideline occupations occupy a dominant position in the entire sideline occupation production within the next ten years; the income that members obtain from the collective economy accounts for 85% of their total income.
　　Last year, while focusing on increasing the production of grain and cotton, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan vigorously carried out diversified economic activities, achieving remarkable results in the past year. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, the total output value of sideline occupations increased by 37% compared with the previous year. However, the development of collective sideline occupations in various agricultural cooperatives is very slow, with some not developing and some even declining. Last year, the collective sideline occupation income of agricultural cooperatives in nine counties in the Fuling Special District accounted for only 23% of the total sideline occupation income, and about 20% of the cooperatives did not engage in collective sideline occupations. Judging from the pig-raising industry, the most important project in the province's sideline occupation production, the number of pigs raised collectively by agricultural cooperatives accounts for only about 10% of the total.
　　The overly slow development of collective sideline occupations will prevent the rapid increase of labor day remuneration; the excessively large proportion of household sideline occupation income in members' income easily breeds capitalist ideas. It has been discovered in various places that members, due to the increase in household sideline occupation income, have begun to lose interest in agricultural cooperative production, work passively, disobey deployment, and some even specialize in household sideline occupation production. This situation seriously affects the consolidation of the cooperative.
　　When summarizing last year's production experience, various places also found that the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production urgently needs sideline occupations to provide a large amount of fertilizer and funds, and these cannot be achieved effectively only by developing members' household sideline occupations; it is necessary to develop strong collective sideline occupations to be competent. Neijiang Special District recently analyzed the five earliest agricultural cooperatives in the district and found that three of them had rapid production leaps and strong collective concepts among members because their collective sideline occupations developed better; the other two had small increases in production and more chaotic member thinking precisely because their collective sideline occupations developed poorly.
　　The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this issue and instructed various places to actively develop collective sideline occupation production in December last year. After investigation and research, party committees at all levels believe that the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives currently have the conditions to accelerate the development of collective sideline occupations. First, after socialist education and the discussion of the Forty Articles, many members have proposed accelerating the development of collective sideline occupations in rectification. Second, in general, agricultural cooperatives have accumulated some experience in operating collective sideline occupations, purchased some equipment and appliances, and trained a group of management personnel over the past few years. Third, with consecutive years of increased production, the production funds of agricultural cooperatives in various places are more abundant than in the early days of the cooperative. Fourth, the strong support of industrial, financial, and other relevant departments. Wenjiang Special District plans that the number of publicly owned pigs should increase from the current 4% of the total number of pigs to 16% this year. Each agricultural cooperative should raise at least 40 publicly owned pigs. In the last year's distribution and final accounts, agricultural cooperatives in Nanchong, Neijiang, and other special districts have all withdrawn a certain amount of funds specifically for the development of collective sideline occupations. According to the Nanchong Special District plan, the district's collective sideline occupation income can account for 60% of the total sideline occupation income by 1962.
　　While actively developing collective sideline occupations, various parts of Sichuan also pay attention to strengthening the leadership of members' household sideline occupations. Continued assistance will be given to the legitimate sideline occupation activities engaged in by members under the principle of not affecting the production within the cooperative; activities that hinder production within the cooperative or engage in commercial speculation will be strictly restricted; for some agricultural cooperatives with excessive private plots for members, the excessive part will be recovered by the cooperative through debate, and it is not allowed to plant economic crops for sale on the private plots.

### 促进农业社的巩固和生产大跃进  四川加快发展集体副业

    促进农业社的巩固和生产大跃进
    四川加快发展集体副业
    本报特约新华社成都讯　新华社记者刘宗棠报道：四川各地农业社今年决定加快发展集体副业，改变目前集体副业生产和农业生产不相适应的状况，从而使合作社进一步提高和巩固。全省计划在今后十年内，争取做到集体副业在整个副业生产中居于主导地位；社员从集体经济中分得的收入占其总收入85％。
    去年，四川各地农业社在以增产粮棉为主的同时，大力开展了多种经济，一年来获得显著成绩。据有关部门初步统计，全年副业总产值比前年增加了37％。但是，各地农业社集体副业的发展非常缓慢，有的没有发展，有的甚至下降。去年涪陵专区九个县的农业社的集体副业收入只占副业总收入23％，约有20％的社没有经营集体副业。从全省副业生产中最主要的项目养猪业来看，农业社集体养的猪只占总头数10％左右。
    集体副业发展过于迟缓，会使劳动日报酬不能迅速提高；社员收入中家庭副业所占比重过大，容易滋长资本主义思想。各地已经发现社员因家庭副业收入增加，开始对农业社生产不感兴趣，出工消极，不服从调配，有的甚至专搞家庭副业生产。这种情况严重地影响到社的巩固。
    各地在总结去年生产经验的时候还发现，农业生产大跃进急需副业提供大量的肥料、资金，而这些仅靠发展社员家庭副业效果不大，必须发展强大的集体副业才能胜任。内江专区最近分析了全区五个办社最早的农业社，发现其中有三个社生产跃进快、社员集体观念强，都是因为集体副业发展得比较好；另外有两个社增产幅度小、社员思想比较混乱，恰恰都是因为集体副业发展较差。
    中共四川省委十分重视这个问题，去年12月指示各地积极发展集体副业生产。各级党委经过调查研究，认为当前绝大多数农业社都已具备了加快发展集体副业的条件。一、经过社会主义教育和四十条纲要的讨论，许多社员在整改中提出加快发展集体副业的要求。二、一般农业社几年来都积累了一些经营集体副业的经验，添置了一些设备、器具，并培养了一批经营管理人员。三、连年增产，各地农业社的生产资金都比建社初期雄厚。四、工业、财经等有关部门的大力支援。温江专区计划公有猪头数今年应由目前占总猪数4％发展到16％。各个农业社至少要饲养公有猪四十头以上。南充、内江等专区各农业社在去年分配决算中都抽出一定数量的资金，专作发展集体副业使用。按照南充专区规划，到1962年全区集体副业收入即可占副业总收入60％。
    四川各地在积极发展集体副业的同时，还注意加强对社员家庭副业的领导。对于社员在不影响社内生产的原则下所从事的正当副业活动，继续给予协助；对于妨碍社内生产或从事商业投机的活动将严加限制；对部分农业社社员自留地过多的，将通过辩论由社将过多的部分收回，并不许在自留地里种植出售的经济作物。
