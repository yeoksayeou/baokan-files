Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Commercial Trade Unions jointly issued a notice calling on employees of the national commercial system to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the employees of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store. Everyone should be a promoter on the commercial front, boldly breaking all outdated rules that do not meet actual needs, propose revolutionary plans to improve work, build up enthusiasm, strive for advancement, and promote a great leap forward in commercial work.
	The entire staff of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store issued a revolutionary initiative to improve commercial work to Beijing commercial employees on February 5. They proposed: 1. Reduce personnel and improve labor efficiency. Reduce the existing 101 people by 46, a reduction of 45%. The reduced personnel will participate in agricultural production and support the great leap forward in agriculture. The remaining personnel will also expand sales. 2. Adjust working hours. Resolutely break through the eight-hour system and implement a one-shift-to-the-end method. 3. Speed up capital turnover and save expenses. The capital turnover in 1958 should reach eleven times, accelerating 4.63 times compared to 6.37 times in 1957; the expense level in 1958 should decrease by 1.1% compared to 1957. 4. Learn business skills and improve service quality. Adopt diverse teaching methods to ensure that each salesperson is familiar with all the commodities sold in the entire shopping mall in 1958, becoming an all-around salesperson in order to better serve customers.
	The Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Commercial Trade Unions expressed their full support for this initiative in the notice, believing that this is a high expression of the revolutionary enthusiasm of commercial employees, and called on employees of the entire commercial system to actively learn from their revolutionary drive.
	The notice said that there is indeed a phenomenon of overstaffing and inefficiency in commercial enterprises. This phenomenon hinders commercial employees from doing more work for the motherland, the people, and socialist construction, and contributing their greatest strength. As long as all employees break the outdated rules of the original labor quotas with a revolutionary spirit, they will definitely be able to do more with fewer people and transfer a large number of people to support industrial and agricultural production.
	The notice pointed out that the labor intensity of employees in the commercial system is very inconsistent. Some enterprises are busy, some are idle, sometimes busy, sometimes idle. Implementing an eight-hour work system across the board does not fully comply with the actual situation. Various localities can reasonably adjust and properly arrange working hours based on the specific conditions of different regions, different industries, and different seasons, on the basis of raising the revolutionary consciousness of the masses. While highly promoting revolutionary vigor, attention should be paid to protecting the physical health of employees so that this vigor can be sustained.
	The notice said that accelerating capital turnover and saving expenses are the key to improving the operation and management of state-owned commerce and is the main method of saving. In this regard, state-owned commerce still has great potential. Employees of all retail enterprises across the country should actively take action through methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters on the basis of carrying out anti-waste campaigns, clearing all inventory goods, formulating handling methods for goods that have expired or are about to expire, analyzing the sales patterns of various types of goods, and formulating reasonable inventory quotas for goods; on the basis of maintaining reasonable inventory of goods, accelerate turnover and save expenses.
	The notice said that socialist commerce is commerce that serves consumers. All retail commerce should improve service attitudes and establish a new atmosphere of customer satisfaction. The notice suggested that everyone, like the Tianqiao Department Store, formulate and improve service covenants suitable for the conditions of various industries and regions.
	The notice finally said that the specific methods proposed by the employees of the Tianqiao Department Store can be learned in all retail enterprises. Since wholesale commerce is different from retail commerce in specific tasks, it cannot completely adopt the methods of retail stores, but the revolutionary spirit of the Tianqiao Department Store is something that all commercial enterprises, including wholesale commerce, should learn.

    商业部和商业工会全国委员会联合发出号召
    商业职工们，都来响应天桥商场的革命倡议
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国商业部和中国商业工会全国委员会联合发出通知，号召全国商业部系统的职工学习北京天桥百货商场职工的革命气概，大家都来做商业战线上的促进派，大胆地打破一切不符合实际需要的陈规，提出改进工作的革命方案，鼓起干劲，力争上游，促进商业工作的大跃进。
    北京市天桥百货商场全体职工，2月5日向北京市商业职工发出了一个改进商业工作的革命倡议。他们提出：一、减少人员，提高劳动效率。把现有的一百零一人，减去四十六人，减少45％，减少下来的人员，参加农业生产，支援农业大跃进；留下来的人员，还要扩大卖钱额。二、调整工时。坚决突破八小时，实行一班到底的方法。三、加快资金周转，节约费用开支。1958年的资金周转要达到十一次，比1957年的六点三七次加速四点六三次；1958年的费用水平比1957年下降1.1％。四、学习业务技术，提高服务质量。采用多样的教学办法，求得每个售货员在1958年内熟悉全商场经营的商品，作一个全能的售货员，以便更好地为顾客服务。
    商业部和商业工会全国委员会在通知中表示完全支持这个倡议，认为这是商业职工的革命积极性的高度表现，号召全商业部系统的职工积极学习他们这种革命干劲。
    通知说，在商业企业中确实存在着人多事少、人浮于事的现象，这种现象阻碍了商业职工为祖国、为人民、为社会主义建设做更多的工作，贡献出自己最大的力量。只要全体职工以革命的精神，打破原有的劳动定额的陈规，就一定可以做到用较少的人，办好更多的事，调出大批的人力去支援工农业生产。
    通知指出，在商业系统内，职工的劳动强度是很不一致的，有的企业忙，有的企业闲，有的时候忙，有的时候闲，一律实行八小时工作制，不完全符合于实际情况。各地可以根据不同地区、不同行业、不同季节等具体条件，在群众的革命觉悟提高的基础上，合理地调整和妥善地安排工作时间。在高度发扬革命干劲的同时，应当注意保护职工的身体健康，以便把这种干劲持久下去。
    通知说，加速资金周转，节约费用开支是国营商业改善经营管理的关键，是节约的主要方法。在这方面，国营商业还有很大的潜力。全国一切零售企业的职工应当在开展反浪费运动的基础上，通过大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的方法积极地行动起来，清理全部库存商品，对于已经过期失效的商品和将要过期失效的商品，拟定处理办法；分析各类商品的销售规律，制定商品合理库存定额；在保有商品合理库存的基础上，加速周转，节约费用。
    通知说，社会主义商业是为消费者服务的商业。一切零售商业都应当改善服务态度，树立使顾客满意的新风气。通知建议大家同天桥百货商场一样，制订和改进适合于各行业、各地区情况的服务公约。
    通知最后说，天桥百货商场职工提出的具体方法，在一切零售企业中都是可以学习的。由于批发商业在具体任务上与零售商业有所不同，因此也就不能完全采用零售商店的方法，但是天桥百货商场的革命精神，则是一切商业企业，包括批发商业都应当学习的。
