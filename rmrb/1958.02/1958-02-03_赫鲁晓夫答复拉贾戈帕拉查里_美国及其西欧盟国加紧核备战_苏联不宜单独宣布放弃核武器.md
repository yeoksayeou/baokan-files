　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st: The Soviet journal "International Life," published this month, features the exchange of letters between Indian social activist Rajagopalachari and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, in November and December of 1957.

　　In his letter, Rajagopalachari suggested to Khrushchev that the Soviet Union unilaterally renounce the use of thermonuclear weapons for military purposes. He wrote that if "you make such a statement, the West will surely admire your noble morality."

　　In his reply on December 3rd, Khrushchev pointed out that, regrettably, the current situation does not allow the Soviet government to undertake the aforementioned unilateral obligation.

　　Khrushchev wrote that the Soviet Union firmly advocates the condemnation and prohibition of thermonuclear weapons and is always ready to reach relevant agreements with other countries on this issue. However, we must remember that the United States and its Western European allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc are striving to make atomic and hydrogen weapons the basic elements of their armaments, and they even formally declare that they will do so.

　　Khrushchev continued: "The aggressive bloc of Western countries knows that if the Soviet Union makes a guarantee, it will definitely adhere to it and never go back on its word. Therefore, their response to our unilateral abandonment of the use of thermonuclear weapons may be to intensify the accumulation of such weapons in order to gain an advantage, thereby making ultimatum-like demands on the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union unilaterally announces its abandonment of nuclear weapons, but after a certain period of time is forced by the actions of Western countries to change its position on this issue, the result will only damage the trust of people of all countries in our promises and create confusion among those who are fighting for peace, whose support we particularly cherish."

　　Khrushchev pointed out that such a turn of events would cause no small damage to the cause of safeguarding world peace and considerable moral loss to the idea of peaceful coexistence. At the same time, it would complicate the struggle for universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, intensify the atmosphere of distrust in international relations, and intensify the arms race and the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that as long as the governments of Western countries do not show a willingness to take practical disarmament measures and abandon the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, then the Soviet Union can only continue to intensify its struggle for peace and explain to the people of all countries the harm of the policies currently pursued by the imperialist bloc.

　　In a second letter written on December 10th, Rajagopalachari again expressed his belief that the Soviet Union's unilateral abandonment of nuclear weapons would prompt the United States and its allies to follow the Soviet Union's example, thereby leading to a cessation of the "Cold War" and the arms race.

　　In response to this point, Khrushchev wrote that the Soviet Union has more than once taken certain unilateral actions in the area of disarmament, hoping that other countries would follow its example. He mentioned that in the past two or three years, the Soviet Union has reduced its army by almost two million people, but other countries have not followed its example.

　　Khrushchev pointed out, "In the United States, which is openly declaring that it does not intend to stop making destructive weapons even more perfect, can we expect that unilateral action by the Soviet Union will lead to the desired result? If we take into account in this regard that the United States is increasingly resolutely clamoring for preemptive war, then all this will force the Soviet Union to be particularly vigilant in order to take appropriate measures to deal with any unexpected events."

　　Khrushchev drew Rajagopalachari's attention to the fact that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has entrusted the Soviet government to re-examine the issue of further reductions in the Soviet armed forces. Khrushchev expressed his belief that if the unilateral actions taken by the Soviet Union can lead to similar efforts by Western countries, then this will not only lead to an improvement in the international situation, but also pave the way for taking new measures to save mankind from the threat of the arms race and atomic war.

　　赫鲁晓夫答复拉贾戈帕拉查里
    美国及其西欧盟国加紧核备战  苏联不宜单独宣布放弃核武器
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：刚刚出版的苏联“国际生活”二月号发表了印度社会活动家拉贾戈帕拉查里和苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在1957年11月和12月间互相交换的信件。
    拉贾戈帕拉查里在信中向赫鲁晓夫建议，要求苏联单方面放弃使用热核武器于军事目的。他写道，如果“您发表这样的声明，那么西方必将崇敬您的高尚道德”。
    赫鲁晓夫12月3日在回信中指出，遗憾的是现在的形势不允许苏联政府负起上述的单方面的义务。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，苏联坚决主张谴责和禁止热核武器，并且时刻准备就这个问题同其他国家达成有关协议。但是，我们必须记住，美国及其北大西洋公约组织军事集团的西欧盟国竭力要把原子武器和氢武器变成它们军备中的基本要素，它们甚至正式宣称要这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说：“西方国家的侵略集团知道，苏联只要作了保证，它一定会坚持执行，决不食言，因此它们对我们单方面放弃使用热核武器的义务的回答可能是加紧积聚这种武器，以便获得优势，从而向苏联提出最后通牒式的要求。假如苏联单独宣布放弃使用核武器，但是经过一定时间以后又为西方国家的行动所迫而不得不改变自己在这一问题上的立场，那末结果只会破坏各国人民对我们诺言的信任，并在那些为和平而斗争的人们中间造成混乱，而他们的支持是我们所特别珍视的。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，事情的这种转变会给保障世界和平的事业带来不小的损害，会给和平共处的思想带来不少道义上的损失。同时，这也会使争取普遍裁军及禁止原子武器和氢武器的斗争复杂起来，会加剧国际关系中的不信任气氛，加紧军备竞赛和积聚大规模毁灭性的武器。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，只要西方国家的政府不表现出愿意采取实际的裁军措施和放弃使用原子武器和氢武器，那末苏联就只能是继续加紧为和平而斗争，并向各国人民说明帝国主义集团目前所奉行的政策的危害性。
    在12月10日所写的第二封信中，拉贾戈帕拉查里再次表示相信，苏联单方面放弃核武器会促使美国和它的盟国效法苏联的榜样，从而导致停止“冷战”和军备竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答这一点时写道，苏联已经不止一次地在裁军方面采取某种单方面的行动，指望其他国家效法它的榜样。他提到，在最近两三年来，苏联把陆军几乎裁减了二百万人，但是其他国家并没有仿效它的做法。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在美国公开声称它不打算停止使毁灭性武器进一步臻于完善的情况下，我们是否可以指望：苏联单方面的行动能够导致人们所期望的结果呢？如果在这方面考虑到，美国在日益坚决地叫嚣先发制人的战争，那末这一切将迫使苏联特别提高警惕，以便采取应有的方式来应付任何意外的事件。
    赫鲁晓夫提请拉贾戈帕拉查里注意：苏联最高苏维埃已经委托苏联政府再次研究进一步裁减苏联武装部队的问题。赫鲁晓夫表示相信，如果苏联所采取的单方面的行动，能够引起西方国家类似的努力，那末这不仅能够导致国际局势的改善，并且可以为采取新的措施开辟道路，以使人类免除军备竞赛和原子战争的威胁。
