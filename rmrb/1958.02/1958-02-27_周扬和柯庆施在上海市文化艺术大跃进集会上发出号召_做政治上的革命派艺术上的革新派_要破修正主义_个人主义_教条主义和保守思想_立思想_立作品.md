Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. A city-wide Cultural and Artistic Great Leap Forward rally was held in Shanghai on the 25th. Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, encouraged Shanghai's cultural and artistic workers at the meeting to aspire to be continuous revolutionaries in politics, promoters of production, and innovators in artistic creation. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on Shanghai's literary and art workers to exert their utmost efforts to serve the liberated productive forces, settle down among the masses, work diligently on their creations, reflect the unprecedented cause undertaken by the liberated working people, and make the face of Shanghai's literary and artistic work new, newer, and newer every day.

Zhou Yang said: "The upsurge of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country will inevitably be reflected in the literary and artistic field. The task of our literature and art is to express the spiritual outlook of this new era and promote the development of social productive forces. Literary and art workers should firmly take the socialist road and use their artistic creations to cooperate with, reflect, and promote the great leap forward in production of the workers and peasants. The leap forward in literature and art should not be measured simply by opening more publications and building more cinemas and theaters, but mainly by the degree to which literary and artistic works are combined with the broad masses and by the height reached by the ideological and artistic content of the works. Looking back over the past few years, we have been conservative and backward in many aspects of literature and art in terms of thinking and creation. Therefore, all literary and art workers must be revolutionaries in politics, use the weapon of literature and art to help the people eliminate capitalism, promote socialism, eradicate all backward things and backward ideas in the people's lives, and constantly urge the advanced things to grow and thrive."

Zhou Yang pointed out that to build socialist literature and art, it is first necessary to break down revisionism and individualism in literature and art, to break down dogmatism and conservative thinking; to establish ideology and establish works. He said that revisionism, which hangs the banner of Marxism-Leninism but extracts its soul, is manifested in literature and art by advocating that literature and art should not serve the revolution, should not serve socialist construction, and should not be led by the Party, allowing literature and art to compete with politics. This extremely harmful idea has been broken down somewhat in the past, but not enough, and must be broken down now. We must frequently break down bourgeois ideas of personal fame, fortune, and status. We must also break down dogmatism that cannot see the whole picture of things and cannot see things changing, as well as conservative thinking in literature and art that sticks to conventions and follows the rules. At the same time, we must establish a communist worldview. This cannot be achieved solely by reading Marxist-Leninist books; the main thing is that literary and art workers must adhere to the method of going to the countryside and factories, combining with the working people, and combining their thoughts and hearts with the thoughts and hearts of the working people. Writers must have works, otherwise they are empty literary figures. Literature and art must be like factories, with new products, new works that are unprecedented, break through the old patterns in content and style, and reflect advanced people and advanced things.

Zhou Yang finally expressed his views on being innovators in art. He believes that to continuously innovate in art, we must use the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend, bringing forth the new through the old, and the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical as good ways to promote artistic innovation. We should create and perform more works that reflect the current social face and promote social development, and correctly treat literary and artistic heritage, mobilizing the positive factors in these heritages to serve the current socialist construction. He believes that there must be a spirit of innovation to critically treat the heritage. He said that we want to mobilize the ancients to serve today, not let the dead hold back the living. He particularly pointed out that the socialist literary and artistic revolution can only be improved on the basis of popularization and the masses. Therefore, we must attach great importance to mass amateur artistic activities. It is not enough to rely solely on a small number of full-time literary and artistic workers.

In his speech, Ke Qingshi repeatedly encouraged the more than two thousand cultural and artistic workers present to quickly make a leap forward with the great leap forward situation in all aspects, and to strive for the flourishing of Shanghai's literature and art and the prosperity of creation. In his speech, he pointed out that Shanghai's literary and artistic work seemed to be lagging behind in the current situation. He said that the objective conditions for the great leap forward in Shanghai's cultural and artistic work are very superior. The current real life is so rich that there are many themes waiting for writers to write about; Shanghai's literary and artistic team is strong and concentrated, and new forces are constantly growing. No one can use these aspects as an excuse for not being able to move forward quickly. He said that the reason why some people feel that they cannot catch up and cannot write more and better works is that they have not relied on the masses or on the advanced. Therefore, facing countless unprecedented heroic deeds, they feel empty in their hearts and do not know what to write or perform. Without relying on the masses and relying on the advanced, literary and art workers, like all workers, will not have any skills. Ke Qingshi asked all literary and art workers in the city to put down the stinking airs of the old intellectuals, go to labor, go to the masses, and combine with the masses. He said that only in this way can infinite power be generated. He also reminded everyone to look forward, to use socialist thoughts and feelings to explore new things, to try every possible means to overcome difficulties in work; to rely on advanced things to promote literary and artistic undertakings.

    周扬和柯庆施在上海市文化艺术大跃进集会上发出号召
    做政治上的革命派艺术上的革新派
    要破修正主义　个人主义　教条主义和保守思想　立思想　立作品
    新华社上海26日电　25日，上海举行了全市性的文化艺术大跃进集会。中共中央宣传部副部长周扬在会上勉励上海市文化艺术工作者立志做政治上的不断革命派，做生产上的促进派和艺术创作上的革新派。中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施号召上海文艺工作者鼓足干劲，为解放了的生产力服务，到群众中去落户，刻苦创作，反映解放了的劳动人民所从事的前无古人的事业，使上海的文艺工作的面貌为之一新、再新、日日新。
    周扬说：“我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮必然要在文艺领域得到反映。我们的文学艺术的任务就是表现这个新的时代的精神面貌，促进社会生产力的发展。文艺工作者应当坚定地走社会主义道路，并且用自己的艺术创作来配合、反映、推动工农群众的生产大跃进。文学艺术的跃进，不能简单地以多办一些刊物，多建立一些电影院、戏院等为标准来衡量，而主要应该以文艺作品和广大群众相结合的程度来衡量，以作品的思想艺术内容所达到的高度来衡量。回顾几年来，我们在文学艺术的思想和创作方面很多地方是保守落后了。因此，一切文艺工作者必须在政治上做革命派，用文艺的武器帮助人民灭资本主义，兴社会主义，革除人民生活中一切落后的事物、落后的思想，不断地督促先进的东西生长壮大”。
    周扬指出，要建设社会主义文艺，首先必须破文艺中的修正主义、个人主义，破教条主义和保守思想；立思想，立作品。他说，挂着马列主义招牌、抽去马列主义灵魂的修正主义，在文艺中的表现是提倡文艺不要为革命服务，不要为社会主义建设服务，文艺不要受党的领导，让文艺与政治分庭抗礼。这种极有害的思想过去破了一些，还不够，现在还要破。对为个人名利、地位的资产阶级思想要经常破。对看不到事物的全面，看不到事物在变化的教条主义，对文艺上墨守常规，按部就班的保守思想也要破。同时，要立共产主义世界观。这不能单靠读马列主义书本，主要的是文艺工作者必须坚持下乡下厂的办法，和劳动人民相结合，把自己的思想、自己的心和劳动人民的思想、劳动人民的心结合在一起。作家要有作品，否则就是空头文学家。文学艺术要像工厂一样，要有新产品，要有过去所没有的、内容和风格突破过去一套、反映先进人物先进事物的新作品。
    周扬最后对做艺术上的革新派发表意见，他认为要在艺术上不断革新，必须以百家争鸣、百花齐放、推陈出新的方针和多、快、好、省的方针来作为促进艺术革新的好办法。应该多创作多演反映当前社会面貌，促进社会发展的作品，要正确对待文艺遗产，把这些遗产中的积极因素调动起来，为当前社会主义建设服务。他认为必须要有革新精神，批判地对待遗产。他说，我们要动员古人为今天服务，而不是让死人拖住活人。他特别指出社会主义文艺革命只能在普及的、群众的基础上提高，因此，必须十分重视群众业余文艺活动，单靠少数专职文艺工作者是不够的。
    柯庆施在讲话中再三鼓动到会的两千多个文化艺术工作者要随着各方面大跃进的形势迅速跃进，为上海文艺的百花怒放、创作繁荣而奋斗。他在讲话中指出，上海文艺工作在当前形势下，显得落在后面了。他说，上海文化艺术工作大跃进的客观条件，是十分优越的，当前现实生活那么丰富，等待作家去写的题材多得很；上海的文艺队伍又强又集中，新生的力量不断在生长。任何人不能在这几方面为不能很快前进找借口。他说，现在有些人所以感到赶不上去，写不出更多更好的作品，原因是他们没有依靠群众，依靠先进。所以，面对无数史无前例的英勇事迹，反而心中空空，不知道要写什么，演什么。没有依靠群众、依靠先进这两条，文艺工作者和一切工作者一样是不会有本领的。柯庆施要求全市文艺工作者放下旧知识分子的臭架子，到劳动中去，到群众中去，与群众结合。他说，只有这样，才能产生无穷的力量。他还提醒大家要向前看，要以社会主义的思想感情去挖掘新鲜事物，千方百计地克服工作中的困难；依靠先进的东西，来促进文艺事业。
