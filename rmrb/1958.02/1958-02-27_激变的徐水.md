    The Rapid Transformation of Xushui
    By our correspondent Zhang Chao
    Stepping into many villages in Xushui County, the most striking thing is the large-character slogans written on the walls in white powder:
    "Guarantee a yield of 400 jin per mu, and strive for output to exceed the Yellow River!"
    400 jin – this is also the average per-mu grain yield included in the draft plan for the entire county in 1958.
    400 jin – this figure means that the farmers of Xushui County will complete the grain production target in the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Program nine years ahead of schedule.
    400 jin – this figure means that the farmers of Xushui County will more than double the average per-mu yield compared to 1957.
    An average of 400 jin per mu for the entire county was a figure no one dared to imagine in previous years. Not to mention the distant past, but in the five years from 1953 to 1957, there were floods and droughts every year. The highest per-mu yield – in 1957 – was only 214 jin, and the lowest – in 1954 – was 78 jin. In the past, or even last autumn, who would have dared to think that this year we could reach 400 jin?
    The young County Party Secretary, Zhang Guozhong, spent a lot of effort when he was working in a key township to dare to propose 300 jin. This was just a target for a single point. Recently, I met him at the Hebei Province Four-Level Cadre Conference. He kept winking at me, smiling, and said, "At that time, I was considered an activist! But now look, the slogan of 400 jin is plastered all over the villages in the county. Looking back today, I should be considered a conservative."
    Zhang Guozhong made a moving report at the Four-Level Cadre Conference on February 9th. This report showed that, like many counties in Hebei Province, Xushui County had been forced by drought and flood disasters to eat grain transferred in from other provinces almost every year. From 1954 to the first half of 1957, a total of more than 90 million jin of grain was transferred in. From the county to the townships, disaster relief offices were set up everywhere, and disaster relief work was constant throughout the year, tying up a large part of the leadership's energy. The cooperativized farmers were even more unwilling to endure this threat of disaster. Last autumn, a socialist debate in the countryside, followed by the emergence of a nationwide Great Leap Forward situation, inspired the ambition of the vast number of farmers and cadres in Xushui County. They jumped ahead and put forward this bold slogan:
    "Guarantee a yield of 400 jin per mu, and strive for output to exceed the Yellow River!"
    However, 400 jin cannot be achieved with just a slogan. The farmers and cadres of Xushui County are divided into three armies, advancing side by side on two fronts – the agricultural production front and the livestock production front – launching a full-scale attack: one group marching towards water conservancy, one group marching towards pig raising, and one group marching towards technology. In a short period of three months, they have created a series of moving achievements.
    At a symposium, Zhang Guozhong hung up a huge map. Like a geography teacher, he held a bamboo pole and pointed to a schematic diagram full of large and small circles, telling people that Xushui County will basically realize water conservancy this year. In addition to the original ditches, canals, wells, and ponds, they have created a network of plain reservoirs in 80% of the area, and every village has dug a protective river around the village. In 20% of the mountainous areas (including hilly areas), fish-scale pits, horizontal trenches, and water cellars have been dug everywhere, and a large number of gully dams, gully head protection projects, and a medium-sized reservoir have been built; many "women's reservoirs," "Young Pioneer reservoirs," "couples' cellars," "sisters' kilns," "father-son wells," and "brothers' wells" have appeared. In this way, the county's irrigated land has increased from 42% to 97% of the cultivated land area. From then on, the people of Xushui County will no longer fear the great flood of 1954 and the great drought of 1957. This is the most outstanding achievement of the water conservancy army.
    To get 400 jin, it is not enough to just march towards water conservancy. Xushui County has also started a Great Leap Forward in pig raising, mainly by public breeding and supplemented by private breeding (70% public, 30% private). In three months, they sent more than 160 cadres to Hubei, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, Shanxi and other provinces to buy 280,000 fine pig seedlings. By the end of this year, the number of pigs raised in the county can be developed from 37,000 last year to 580,000. In this way, 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu is a sure thing.
    In order to get 400 jin, Xushui County has created a brand-new technical army. According to the principle of "what technical difficulties there are, what training classes will be opened," they have trained 4,000 technical personnel in pig raising, fruit trees, veterinary medicine, poultry, machinery, and other fields. From the county party secretary to the commune cadres, they are all engaged in experimental fields.
    Leading the county's farmers to cross the Yellow River and force the Yangtze River requires a command post that is good at organizing battles. The County Party Committee thoroughly eliminated the general leadership style of previous years and created a leadership method of "strengthening the front line, twisting into a rope," "highlighting key points, combining multiple aspects, dividing battle lines, and unified leadership." Centering on one center – developing water conservancy and raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer – the main force of the county was invested in the front line, the county-level organs were formed into a unified logistics force, and the entire battlefield was divided into two battle lines, agriculture and animal husbandry, with one upsurge followed by another, and one battle followed by another, leading more than 300,000 farmers to successfully end the first decisive winter campaign this year.
    These are the changes that have taken place in just three months.
    However, the changes are still developing rapidly.
    The changes in three months have also caused new problems: since 97% of the cultivated land has been irrigated, since 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu is a sure thing, and since there is a newly built technical army, is the target of 400 jin too low?
    In those days, Zhang Guozhong and his partners were constantly tossing and turning in the torrent. In the middle of the Four-Level Cadre Conference, the heroic spirit of the masses was transmitted from the county every day, and the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward at the meeting was constantly exciting people. They repeatedly measured this number day and night: is it too low?
    On the night of February 12th, they consulted with Secretary Yang Guohua and Liu Bushang, who stayed in the County Party Committee, through a long-distance telephone call: "How about raising it to 500 jin and striving for 600 jin? Re-calculate the accounts with the townships." That night, Yang and Liu firmly replied to them: "500 jin is no problem. The townships have also proposed striving for 703 jin. ..."
    As a result, 400 jin was discarded as a conservative figure again. People's ambition is to cross the Yellow River and force the Yangtze River.
    Almost at the same time, another message came out: according to the instructions of the County Party Committee, the branch secretaries of the townships held an all-night meeting on the evening of February 11th, deciding that before the Lunar New Year's Eve, within a week, they would mobilize the masses to repair and raise the roadbeds of the county's main roads by 1,400 li, so that in the future, larger floods could be drained and divided in various areas, so that 500 jin would not be attacked by accident; at the same time, it could make the county's roads suitable for large trucks and cars.
    The next day, these township branch secretaries, who had not slept all night, returned to their townships and immediately led the road-building army to start a new battle.
    The changes will continue to develop rapidly.
    People who have been away from Xushui County for three months, returning there at this moment, will be presented with a completely new natural landscape. In just a short winter, the frozen fields have been turned over, and the dams of the plain reservoirs are exuding the scent of new soil; the roads cut the plain into several large blocks, and the hills are like after a careful carving. This year, the heavy rain will not find a place to be tyrannical, and the hot sun will not dry up the vast fields. When autumn comes, look! This northern plain will become a Jiangnan water town; listen! The telephone in the County Party Committee office will constantly transmit the good news of the harvest from more than 200 agricultural cooperatives all day long. The young County Party Secretary Zhang Guozhong will once again keep winking and smiling at me, saying:
    "We got 500 jin!"

    激变的徐水
    本报记者　张潮
    走进徐水县的许多村庄，最惹人注目的，便是用白粉写在墙壁上的大字标语：
    “保证亩产四百斤，争取产量过黄河！”
    四百斤，这也是列入全县1958年规划草案中的粮食平均亩产量。
    四百斤，这个数字意味着：徐水县的农民要提前九年完成农业纲要四十条中的粮食产量指标。
    四百斤，这个数字意味着：徐水县的农民要翻一翻，比1957年的平均亩产量增加近一倍。
    全县亩产四百斤，在往年，是谁也不敢去想的数字。远的不说，从1953年到1957年的五年当中，年年遭水灾和旱灾，亩产量最高的一年——1957年也只有二百一十四斤，最低的一年——1954年是七十八斤。往年，或者就说到去年秋天吧，谁敢去想今年能达到四百斤？
    年轻的县委书记张国忠，当时钻在重点乡，费了多少劲，才敢提出三百斤。这还不过是一个点的目标。最近，我在河北省四级干部会议上见到他，他向我不住眨着眼睛，笑笑说：“那会我算得上积极分子呢！可是，现在你看，四百斤的标语贴遍了全县的村庄。今天回过头去看，该是保守分子了。”
    张国忠在2月9日的四级干部会上作了一个动人的报告，这个报告表明：这几年，徐水县同河北省的许多县份一样，旱涝灾害逼得广大农民几乎年年要吃外省调入的粮食，从1954年到1957年上半年，一共调进粮食九千多万斤。从县到乡，普遍设立救灾办公室，救灾工作常年不断，牵制了很大一部分的领导精力，合作化了的农民更不甘心忍受这种灾害的威胁。去年秋天，农村一场社会主义大辩论，跟着一个全国大跃进局面的出现，激发了徐水县广大农民和干部的志气。他们一步跳到前头，提出这个豪迈的口号：
    “保证亩产四百斤，争取产量过黄河！”
    但是，四百斤不是用一个口号就能换到的。徐水县的农民和干部分成三路大军，在两条战线——农业生产战线和畜牧生产战线上齐头并进，全面出击——一路向水利进军，一路向养猪进军，一路向技术进军。在短短三个月的时间里，他们创造了一连串的动人业迹。
    在一个座谈会上，张国忠挂起一幅巨大的地图。他像一个地理教员那样，拿着一根竹杆，指划着画满大小圆圈的示意图，告诉人们：徐水县今年就基本上实现水利化。除开原有的沟洫井塘等水利工程，他们在80％的面积上创建了星罗棋布的平原水库，村村都挖护村河。在20％的山区（包括丘陵区）挖遍了鱼鳞坑、水平沟、水窖，建起了大批谷坊、沟头防护工程和一个中型水库；出现了许多“妇女水库”、“红领巾水库”、“夫妻窖”、“姐妹窑”、“父子井”、“兄弟井”。就这样，使全县水地从占耕地面积的42％增加到97％。从此，徐水县的人民再不怕1954年的大水和1957年的大旱。这是水利大军的最出色的战果。
    要拿到四百斤，光靠向水利进军还不行。徐水县同时开始一个以公养为主、私养为辅（公七私三）的养猪大跃进。在三个月内，他们派一百六十多名干部分赴湖北、山东、河南、辽宁、山西等省，买到优良猪秧二十八万头。到今年年底，全县养猪头数可以从去年的三万七千头发展到五十八万头。这样，每亩万斤肥，就十拿九稳了。
    为了拿到四百斤，徐水县创建了一支全新的技术大军。他们根据“什么技术困难，就开办什么训练班”的原则，分别训练了四千名养猪、果树、兽医、家禽、机器等技术人员。从县委书记到社干部，都搞试验田。
    领导全县农民跨黄河、逼长江，需要有一个善于组织战斗的指挥部。县委彻底扫除了往年的一般化的领导作风，创造了“加强第一线、拧成一股绳”，“重点突出、多边结合、划分战线、统一领导”的领导方法。围绕一个中心——发展水利和养猪积肥，把全县主要力量投入第一线，把县级机关组成一个统一的后勤部队，把整个战场划成农业和畜牧两条战线，一个高潮接着一个高潮，一个战斗跟着一个战斗，指挥三十多万农民胜利地结束了今年头一个具有决定意义的冬季战役。
    这是短短三个月内发生的变化。
    但是，变化还在急剧地发展着。
    三个月的变化也引起了新问题：既然97％的耕地水利化了，既然每亩万斤肥十拿九稳了，既然有了一支新建的技术大军，四百斤的指标低不低？
    那几天，张国忠和他的伙伴们时时刻刻在激流中翻腾。在四级干部会议进行中间，群众的英雄干劲天天从县里传出来，会上的大跃进气氛时刻激动着人，他们日日夜夜反复地衡量着这个数字：低不低？
    2月12日夜里，他们通过长途电话同留在县委的书记杨国华和刘卜商量：“提到五百斤、争取六百斤，怎么样？同各乡重新算算账。”当天晚上，杨和刘坚定地答复他们：“五百斤没问题。各乡还提出争取七百零三斤。……”
    于是，四百斤又被当作一个保守的数字抛掉了。人们的雄心是跨过黄河逼长江。
    几乎同时，又传出一个消息：各乡支部书记根据县委的指示，在2月11日晚间开了一通宵会议，决定：在旧历除夕以前，一个星期以内，发动群众整修加高全县大道路基一千四百华里，以便将来把更大的洪水沥水分割在各个地区内，不让五百斤受到意外的袭击；同时可使全县道路行驶大车和汽车。
    第二天，这些通宵不眠的乡支部书记们回到乡里，随即率领修路大军开始了一个新的战斗。
    变化还会急剧地发展下去。
    离开徐水县三个月的人，此刻回到那儿，在他面前会呈现出一幅面目全新的大自然景象。不过一个短暂的冬天，封冻的田野翻了一个身，一座座平原水库的堤坝，散发着新土的气息；条条大道把平原切成几大块，山岗宛如经过一翻精细的雕刻。今年，大雨将找不到作威作福的场所，烈日也晒不干广阔的田野。秋天到来的时候，看吧！这片北国的平原将变成江南的水乡；听吧！县委办公室的电话机将终日不断地传来二百多个农业社丰收的喜报。这位年轻的县委书记张国忠，将再一次不停地眨着眼睛，向我笑着说：
    “我们拿到了五百斤！”
