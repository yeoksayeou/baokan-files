Xinhua News Agency, 5th - In the past few days, the group meetings of the National People's Congress have been filled with a strong atmosphere of revolutionary competition. Representatives have been discussing "Catching Up!" The advanced should become even more advanced, and the backward should be inspired to catch up with the advanced.

The revolutionary heroic spirit reflected by the representatives foreshadows that this year's great leap forward in construction will further develop into a nationwide revolutionary emulation campaign for socialist construction.

　　Find Advanced Indicators, Learn from Advanced Experiences, Catch Up with and Surpass Advanced Production Levels

In the past few days, representatives from industrial areas such as Shenyang and Fushun, as well as some representatives from Beijing, have been anxiously taking time to inquire at relevant agencies and enterprises about advanced production indicators at home and abroad. Fei Guangtai, the chief engineer of the Fushun Mining Bureau, who is over fifty years old, has repeatedly gone to relevant units of the Ministry of Coal Industry to inquire about British coal production data, as well as production indicators of domestic coal mines. Wang Wenshan, a national model worker in the industry and director of the first workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, led a group to the Dalian Machine Tool Factory to understand production indicators and learn advanced experiences before coming to the meeting; during this meeting, he also went to units such as the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to understand information on production indicators. He said that learning from the advanced and surpassing the advanced is the strong desire of our vast number of workers. According to the talks of many representatives, many factories and mining enterprises across the country have sent representatives to relevant enterprises to find advanced indicators and learn from advanced experiences, and are prepared to catch up with and surpass advanced production levels in a short period of time.

The representatives mentioned that in the wave of competition to compare with the advanced and catch up with the advanced, the backwardness of some units has begun to change. Li Shusen, a representative of Beijing and chief engineer of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, said that since the beginning of this year, the factory's employees have put forward the resounding slogan of catching up with and surpassing the national advanced level. After a recent period of efforts, some indicators of the factory have exceeded the national advanced level, and some are approaching the national advanced level. For example, the production cycle for major locomotive repairs was reduced to eleven days in January this year, which is more than five days shorter than the same period last year, breaking through the thirteen point nine-day indicator of the most advanced Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in the country. The cost indicator used to be the most backward. The cost of major repairs per locomotive was 7,000 yuan more than the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory, and the cost of intermediate repairs was 3,500 yuan more. This situation has changed greatly in January this year. According to the calculable part, the cost of semi-finished products per major repaired locomotive was saved by more than 2,400 yuan on average compared with last year, and the intermediate repair was saved by more than 1,400 yuan compared with last year. Guo Shude, a representative of Beijing and deputy section chief of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration, said that there are many wasteful phenomena in the locomotive depot where he works. Now the employees have put forward the action slogan of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, finding waste, and eliminating waste." Originally, the leaders of the section planned to increase production and save 178,000 yuan this year, including a plan to save 3,000 tons of coal; but after the employees' discussion, they found the root of waste, and the value of increased production and savings soared to 700,700 yuan, with the coal saving figure increasing to 13,000 tons. Since January, some groups in this section have broken through some planned targets.

　　Prevent Complacency, Break Conservative Thinking, Production Will Not Reach the Top

Some representatives from advanced units expressed sufficient confidence in achieving advanced progress again. They pointed out that as long as complacency is prevented and conservative thinking is broken, production will not reach the top, and new records can be continuously created. Rao Xingli, a representative of Hubei Province and an agricultural model worker, said that in 1957, the average yield per mu of land in his agricultural cooperative had reached more than 1,100 jin, and the highest yield per mu had approached 2,000 jin. In order to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1958, in addition to launching large-scale water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movements last winter and this spring, the cooperative members also focused on summarizing the high-yield experience of high-yield areas, and found specific ways to further implement intensive cultivation, rationally arrange labor, and improve production tools and seeds throughout the cooperative. This year, after the high-yield experience of the high-yield areas is promoted, the average yield per mu of land in the cooperative can be increased to more than 1,400 jin, and by 1959, the grain yield of all cultivated land in the cooperative can be increased to 2,000 jin.

　　In Remote, Out-of-the-way, and Extremely Cold Regions, Launch a Tenacious Struggle Against Nature

What is encouraging is the situation of "catching up with the advanced" mentioned by some representatives from remote, out-of-the-way, and extremely cold regions. The people in these regions have launched a hard and tenacious struggle against nature and done things that no predecessors have ever done. Zhao Bin, a representative of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and director of the Wusan Agricultural Cooperative in Chifeng County, said that what they did not dare to imagine in the past has now become a reality. The climate there is minus thirty degrees, and the ground is frozen several feet deep, but the farmers are still building water conservancy projects; the cooperative now has more than 2,000 people working every day, building a twelve-mile-long canal, preparing to draw water up the mountain. Xue Wanxiang, a model afforestation worker from Gansu Province, talked about the tenacious struggle of the people of Minqin County in his hometown to eliminate the disaster of flowing sand. Minqin County was originally a barren and poor place, and the people suffered from the disaster of flowing sand. There was often a serious situation of "sand dunes pressing on villages, flowing sand burying farmland, the west wind killing farmland, and the east wind drying farmland." In the past, there were cases of fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girls not being able to afford pants; after several years of efforts by the masses, more than 300,000 mu of forest were planted, and the flowing sand was finally stopped, and the yield of crops doubled. Now the lives of farmers have been greatly improved, and the girls are all wearing colorful clothes.

　　Minority Nationalities Want to Make a Great Leap Forward, Crossing Several Centuries in a Few Years

Representatives from border minority nationality areas mentioned that the discrimination and vendettas between nationalities during the reactionary rule have not only long been eliminated after liberation, but also in today's upsurge of socialist revolution, some minority nationality people have also put forward the slogan of a great leap forward. They want to catch up with the advanced, compare with the Han people, and strive to cross several centuries in a few years. Representatives from the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province all stated in group meetings that they would learn from the Han people and make a great leap forward together with the Han people. Zhang Rong, Secretary of the CPC Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Committee, said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the 860,000 Yi people in Liangshan, who have turned over from the slave system, have laid the foundation for the great leap forward of socialism. 27% of the farmers in the prefecture have crossed thousands of years of history in the past one or two years and participated in advanced agricultural cooperatives. Yi farmers, who did not know about fertilization before liberation, applied thousands of jin of manure per mu of land last year. Last year, the grain yield per mu in the Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas has increased from several tens of jin before liberation to more than 130 jin. Now more Yi farmers are enthusiastically asking to join the cooperatives. The autonomous prefecture's plan to have 45% of the farmers join the cooperatives this year is likely to be broken. The autonomous prefecture will basically achieve cooperation within two or three years, and the grain yield will reach 400 jin per mu within ten years. Zhang Rong said that according to the conditions and current situation of Liangshan, they have the confidence to catch up with the production level of the Han mountainous areas within ten years. Pingbian County, Yunnan Province, is a region where the Miao, Yao, and Han nationalities live together. Li Guangrong (Yao nationality), the deputy county head of the county, talked about the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in the group meeting. Last winter and this spring, the vast number of farmers in the county, like other parts of the country, launched a great production upsurge. When the county leadership put forward a plan to increase grain production by 15% to 20% this year and submitted it to the farmers for discussion, the farmers considered the plan to be conservative. They guaranteed that they would reclaim 10,000 mu of wasteland this year, turn 6,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and achieve the task of increasing grain production by 20% to 30%.

Since last winter, things that the leadership had not fully anticipated have occurred in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Four counties in the prefecture are agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. During the mass rectification movement, these areas also launched a great debate. As a result, the awareness of the masses was greatly improved, and they demanded to participate in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. These four counties originally only piloted a few cooperatives. Now these four counties have established 195 advanced agricultural cooperatives, 318 primary agricultural cooperatives, and 48 pastoral cooperatives. The number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounts for more than 60% of the total number of farmers in the four counties. In addition, the province originally proposed that the prefecture would build 50,000 mu of paddy fields this year, which was later increased to 80,000 mu. After discussion by the masses, it was increased to 160,000 mu, and now 51% has been completed; the accumulation of manure has completed 58% of the annual task. Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan nationality), the deputy governor of Gansu Province and the governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said when talking about these situations that the enthusiasm of the masses was completely unexpected to us, and the masses criticized us for being conservative. On the matter of running cooperatives, we originally planned that it would not be possible to do it in 1962, but now the masses have done it ahead of schedule, so that the leading cadres and accountants of the cooperatives are not prepared enough. Huang Zhengqing said that the Tibetan people must be more motivated in the future, learn from the Han people, and strive to catch up with the advanced.

The discussion of the representatives proved that the situation of the nationwide revolutionary emulation campaign for socialist construction cannot but accelerate the progress of history.

　　学习先进　赶过先进
    掀起全民性的革命大竞赛
    人民代表在小组会中纷纷谈论“赶上去！”
    新华社5日讯　在几天来的全国人民代表大会小组会的讨论中，洋溢着一种强烈的革命竞赛的气氛。代表们纷纷谈论着“赶上去！”要先进的再先进，落后的鼓起劲来赶先进。
    代表们所反映出来的这种革命英雄气概，预示着今年的建设大跃进将进一步形成一个全民性的社会主义建设的革命大竞赛。
　　找先进指标　学先进经验  赶上和超过先进生产水平
    几天以来，来自沈阳、抚顺等工业区的一些代表，以及北京市的一些代表，都以焦急的心情抽空到有关机关、企业去查询国内和国外的先进生产指标。五十多岁的抚顺矿务局总工程师费广泰，曾经数次跑到煤炭工业部有关单位查询英国煤炭生产资料，以及国内煤矿的生产指标等资料。全国工业劳动模范、沈阳第一机床厂第一车间主任王文山，在来开会以前就带领一个组到大连机床厂了解生产指标，学习先进经验；在这次会议中，他又跑到北京第一机床厂等单位了解生产指标方面的资料。他说，学习先进，赶过先进，是我们广大职工强烈的愿望。根据许多代表的谈话，目前全国很多厂矿企业都纷纷派出代表，到有关企业找先进指标，学习先进经验，并且准备在短时间内赶上和超过先进的生产水平。
    代表们谈到，在比先进赶先进的竞赛浪潮中，有些单位的落后面貌开始改变。北京市代表、长辛店机车车辆修理厂总工程师李树森说，今年年初以来，他们厂的职工提出了赶上并且超过全国先进水平的响亮口号，经过最近一个时期的努力，这个厂有的指标已经超过全国先进水平，有的正在接近全国先进水平。如大修机车生产周期今年1月降低到十一天，比去年同期缩短了五天多，突破了全国最先进的戚墅堰机车车辆修理厂的十三点九天的指标。成本指标过去最落后，每台机车大修成本要比牡丹江机车修理厂多花七千元，中修成本多花三千五百元，今年1月份这种情况有了很大改变，根据可以计算的部分计算，每台机车大修所耗的半成品费，比去年平均节省了两千四百多元，中修比去年节省了一千四百多元。北京市代表、北京铁路管理局丰台机务段副段长郭树德说，他所在的机务段有很多浪费现象，现在职工们提出了“比先进、学先进、赶先进、找浪费、消灭浪费”的行动口号，原来段的领导计划今年增产节约价值十七万八千元，其中计划节约煤炭三千吨；但是经过职工们的讨论，找出了浪费的根源，增产节约价值激增到七十万零七千元，其中煤炭节约数字增加到一万三千吨。1月份以来，这个段有些小组已经突破了一些计划指标。
　　防止骄傲　打破保守  生产就不会到顶
    一些来自先进单位的代表，表示有足够的信心做到先进再先进。他们提出，只要防止骄傲，打破保守思想，生产是不会到顶的，而且可以不断创造新的纪录。湖北省代表、农业劳动模范饶兴礼说，他所在的农业合作社1957年全社每亩地的平均产量已达到一千一百多斤，最高亩产量已接近两千斤。为了争取1958年的农业大丰收，这个社的社员除在去冬今春展开了大规模地兴修水利和积肥运动以外，还着重对高产地的丰产经验作了总结，找出了如何进一步在全社实行精耕细作、合理安排劳动力以及改良生产工具和种籽的具体办法。今年这个社把高产地的丰产经验加以推广之后，全社每亩地的平均产量就可以提高到一千四百斤以上，到1959年就可以把全社所有耕地的粮食产量提高到两千斤。
　　在边远、偏僻、酷寒地区  对自然界展开顽强的斗争
    令人鼓舞的是一些来自边远的、偏僻的以及酷寒地区的代表所谈到的“赶先进”的情况，这些地区的人民对自然界展开了艰苦顽强的斗争，干了一些前人从来没有干过的事情。内蒙古自治区代表、赤峰县五三农业社主任赵斌说，过去他们不敢想像的现在都成为事实了，他们那里的气候在零下三十度，地冻几尺深，农民同样兴修水利；这个合作社现在每天出勤两千多人，兴修一条十二里长的水渠，准备把水引上山去。甘肃省代表造林模范薛万祥谈到他的家乡民勤县人民为消灭流沙灾害所进行的顽强斗争。民勤县原是一个荒漠贫困的苦地方，人民苦于流沙的灾害，往往出现“沙丘压庄园，流沙埋农田，西风打死田，东风吹干田”的严重情况。过去有十五、六岁姑娘穿不上裤子的事情；经过群众几年来的努力，造林三十多万亩，流沙终于被止住了，作物的产量增加了一倍。现在农民的生活大大改善，姑娘们都穿上花衣服了。
　　少数民族要大跃进  几年之内跨过几个世纪
    来自边疆的少数民族地区的代表谈到，反动统治时期民族之间的歧视和仇杀，解放后不仅早已消除，而且在今天的社会主义革命高潮中，有些少数民族人民也提出了大跃进的口号，他们要赶先进，比汉族人民，努力争取在几年之内跨过几个世纪。来自四川省凉山彝族自治州、阿坝藏族自治州的代表在小组会上都表示，要向汉族人民看齐，和汉族人民一起向前大跃进。中共凉山彝族自治州委员会书记张荣说：在共产党领导下，从奴隶制度下翻过身来的八十六万凉山彝族人民，已经为社会主义的大跃进打下了基础，全州已有27％的农户在过去一两年内跨过了几千年的历史，参加了高级农业合作社。解放前从不知道施肥的彝族农民，去年在每亩地里施了上千斤的粪肥。去年大小凉山里的每亩粮食产量，已经由解放前的几十斤增加到一百三十多斤。现在更多的彝族农民正在热烈要求入社，自治州今年打算有45％的农户入社的计划，很可能被突破。这个自治州将在两三年内达到基本上合作化，十年内要使粮食产量达到每亩四百斤。张荣说，根据凉山的条件和目前的情况，他们有信心在十年内赶上汉族山区的生产水平。云南省屏边县是苗、瑶、汉各民族杂居的地区，这个县的副县长李光荣（瑶族）在小组会上谈到各族人民的革命干劲。去冬今春，这个县的广大农民也和全国各地一样掀起了大生产的热潮，县的领导上提出今年增产粮食15％到20％的计划提交农民们讨论时，农民们认为这个计划保守，他们保证今年要开垦生荒一万亩，把六千亩旱地变成水田，实现增产粮食20％到30％的任务。
    去年冬天以来，在甘南藏族自治州发生了领导上完全没有意料到的事情。这个州有四个县是农业和半农半牧业地区，在全民整风运动中，这些地区也开展了大辩论，结果群众的觉悟大大提高，纷纷要求参加农业和牧业合作社。这四个县原先只试办了几个合作社，现在这四个县已经建立了一百九十五个高级农业社、三百一十八个初级农业社、四十八个牧业社，入社农户占四个县农户总数的60％以上。另外，省里原先提出这个州今年修水田五万亩，后加到八万亩，经过群众讨论加到十六万亩，现在已经完成了51％；积肥已经完成今年全年任务的58％。甘肃省副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清（藏族）在谈到这些情况时说，群众的这种干劲使我们完全料想不到，群众批评我们保守了。在办合作社的事情上，我们原计划1962年还做不到的，现在群众提前做到了，以致合作社的领导干部和会计等，都准备不够。黄正清说，藏族人民今后要更加鼓起干劲，向汉族人民学习，大步地赶先进。
    从代表们的讨论中证明了，全民性的社会主义建设的革命大竞赛的形势，是不能不加速历史的前进的。
