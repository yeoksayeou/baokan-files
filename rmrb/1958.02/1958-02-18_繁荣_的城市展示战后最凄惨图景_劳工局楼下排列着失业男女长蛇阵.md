Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th Dispatch: Bridgeport, Connecticut, which has been considered one of America's "prosperous" cities in recent years, has now entered its most tragic days since the war.

These days, the office building of the State Labor Bureau has become a place reflecting the city's unemployment misery. Every day, eight rows of long lines of unemployed men and women line up in front of the office building. The unemployed listlessly join the queue, silently one after another walk to the window to apply for relief money and look for work.

This "prosperous" city in New England has a total of 125,000 workers. So far, 13,000 people are unemployed, and this number is swelling day by day.

A worried mood hangs over the entire city. One unemployed person in the queue said:
	"If it doesn't involve you, you often say this is a (economic) recession. But if you yourself are one of those affected, then this is a depression."

The first commercial sector affected was car dealers. One dealer said his new car sales were down 50% from last year, "The 1958 models just won't sell."

Another dealer went bankrupt in one week because seventeen of his customers couldn't pay their installment debts and had to return the original cars. Then the bank decided his business was over.

Along the street, the display windows are full of huge discount advertisements, some even discounted by half. However, those windows are still filled with radios, televisions, washing machines, and electric refrigerators. No one comes to inquire. Unemployed people aged twenty-five to thirty-five are the hardest hit because they have not experienced real unemployment since the war. A thirty-one-year-old typewriter factory worker named Robert Marquis said: "This is not a recession, this is a depression." He has a wife and two children, but now he can only receive $48 in relief money per week. A carpenter union member named Bob McRevy said that 20%-25% of the 1,200 people in his union are already receiving unemployment benefits. He said that if the current situation continues for another three months, many of them will lose their homes because they cannot pay their installments. (Attached picture)

### “繁荣”的城市展示战后最凄惨图景  劳工局楼下排列着失业男女长蛇阵

    “繁荣”的城市展示战后最凄惨图景
    劳工局楼下排列着失业男女长蛇阵
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：最近几年来被认为是美国“繁荣”城市之一的康?狄格州布利治波特现在已经进入了战后最凄惨的日子。
    州劳工局的办公楼这些天来已经成了反映这个城市的失业惨状的一个场所。办公室楼前每天排列着八行失业男女的长蛇阵。失业者无精打采地排入这个行列，默默地一个接着一个走到窗口，要求领取救济金和寻找工作。
    新英格兰的这个“繁荣”的城市一共有十二万五千名工人。到现在为止，失业的已经有一万三千人，而且这个数字正在一天天膨胀。
    忧心忡忡的情绪笼罩着整个城市。排在队伍中的一个失业者说：
  “如果没有牵连到你自己，你往往说这是一次（经济）衰退。但是，如果你自己也是一个受到打击的人，那末，这就是一次萧条了。”
    最先受到影响的商业部门是汽车推销商。一个推销商说，他的新车销售量比去年下降了50％，“1958年式的新车硬是卖不出去”。
    另外一个推销商在一个星期内破了产，因为他的十七个顾客缴不出分期付款的欠账而只好把原车退回，接着银行就认为他的生意完蛋了。
    沿着大街的陈设橱窗内贴满了大减价的广告，有的甚至减价一半。但是，那些橱窗里仍然堆满着无线电收音机、电视机、洗衣机和电气冰箱。没有人来问津。二十五岁到三十五岁的失业者所感受的打击最大，因为他们在战后还没有尝过真正的失业味道。一个三十一岁的名叫罗伯特·马基斯的打字机制造工人说：“这不是衰退，这是萧条。”他有一个妻子和两个孩子，但是现在他只能领每周四十八美元的救济金。名叫鲍布·麦克列维的一个木匠工会会员说，和他同属一个工会的一千二百人中，已经有20％—25％在领取失业救济金了。他说，如果目前情况再继续三个月，他们当中有许多人将因缴不出分期付款而失去他们的住宅。（附图片）
