Adhere to the policy of building the army through diligence and thrift, and actively participate in national construction
Speech by Representative Gan Siqi

I fully agree with all the reports of the conference. I will only talk about building the army through diligence and thrift and the army's participation in national socialist construction.

This year is the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan. The people of the whole country are vigorously and enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, striving to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important products in fifteen years or a little longer, and striving for a great leap forward and bumper harvest in agriculture to realize the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program as soon as possible. Recently, good news has been coming from all walks of life. All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are delighted and encouraged by this. In order to achieve this grand goal, the army is stepping up combat training, vigilantly defending national defense, adhering to the policy of building the army through diligence and thrift, and actively participating in the country's socialist construction.

In the past year, all officers and soldiers saved more than 60 million catties of grain, 41 million catties of horse feed, more than 50,000 tons of coal for cooking, 2.77 million sets of clothing, and 3.79 million catties of cotton; they produced 216.5 million catties of vegetables, 7.4 million catties of grain and oil, more than 200,000 pigs, and 110,000 cattle and sheep.

As everyone knows, in order to use national funds mainly for economic construction, the national defense expenditure in the national budget has been reduced every year since the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. In 1953, the national defense expenditure was 6,176,440,000 yuan, accounting for 28.87 percent of the total national budget for that year; in 1957, the national defense expenditure was 5,523,320,000 yuan, accounting for 18.85 percent of the total national budget; this year's national defense budget is 5 billion yuan, which has dropped to 15.12 percent of the total national budget. So, will this affect national defense construction and army building? We say no. As Vice Premier Li Xiannian said in his report, our army is the people's army, and we should have the ambition and determination to do the most with the least amount of money. Last year, the national defense expenditure was reduced by several billion yuan compared with the previous year, but as a result of our thorough implementation of the policy of building the army through diligence and thrift and practicing strict economy, we still completed the established construction plans and training tasks, saving a total of 74.5 million yuan in expenses and other materials. Last year, when grain and coal were once in short supply, all officers and soldiers saved more than 60 million catties of grain, 41 million catties of horse feed, and more than 50,000 tons of coal for cooking; last year, when cotton cloth and cotton were in short supply, all officers and soldiers wore clothes thriftily and sparingly, saving 2.77 million sets of single and cotton clothes, and 3.79 million catties of cotton; last year, the supply of non-staple foods on the market was also relatively tight. In addition to buying less New Year goods and meat during the Spring Festival, the army grew and harvested 216.5 million catties of vegetables, 7.4 million catties of grain and oil crops, and raised more than 200,000 pigs (excluding more than 10 million catties of pork that the troops have slaughtered and eaten) and 110,000 cattle and sheep. This has played a role in ensuring the needs of the troops and reducing the supply on the market. In order to take care of mass production and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, various troops also reduced military land by more than 175,000 mu, returned more than 72,400 rented civilian houses, and returned more than 420,000 square meters of public houses. The army has now stipulated that, except for some troops that really need it, they can continue to rent civilian houses, but generally they will no longer rent civilian houses. This year, according to the opinions put forward by the masses during the rectification campaign, only three items, such as lowering the current supply standards, adjusting and canceling some unnecessary construction projects, and reducing the expenditure of some business plans, can reduce the budget by 22,715,000 yuan. From the supply standard, it is determined that each person will reduce one or two liang of grain and six liang of coal per day from this year; the quality of officers' clothing will be reduced, and the service life will be extended; barrack construction will basically stop; after returning the rented civilian and public houses, a leasing fee and repair fee can also be saved. Judging from the anti-waste campaign currently being launched in the army, the phenomenon of waste is universal in the army, and some are very serious. The broad masses of officers and soldiers are conducting special discussions and continuing to dig potential and find ways to save military expenditures; various departments are also considering using limited military expenditures in the most necessary and useful aspects according to the principle of spending less money and doing more things, formulating specific plans for various tasks, and improving and establishing some necessary systems to eliminate waste. Therefore, we say that reducing the national defense expenditure by several billion yuan is not only necessary, but also feasible.

Public bond purchases are completed in excess every year; the tractor stations established by donations can cultivate 3 million mu of land; the voluntary labor to support agricultural production and national construction amounted to nearly 20 million workdays last year; and the number of troops participating in flood control and disaster relief reached 300,000.

Secondly, let's talk about some situations in which the army supports national socialist construction. The broad masses of the army have always been enthusiastic and active in supporting national construction. Taking the purchase of public bonds as an example, from 1954 to 1957, the average number of public bonds purchased by the army in excess of the national allocation reached 66.28 percent; although the number of officers has decreased this year, the subsidies for multiple children have been canceled, and public bonds have increased, many troops have completed the quota in excess, and some units have exceeded the allocated number by 200 percent. Many comrades said: "Buying public bonds is an investment in a happy life in the future. As long as the motherland's socialist construction is good, it doesn't matter if we are more difficult now!" This enthusiasm is also manifested in supporting agricultural cooperation, agricultural production, flood control and drought resistance, and disaster relief. The task of donating to establish tractor stations initiated by the army was originally scheduled to be completed in three years. Because many comrades took out their savings to subscribe, and some comrades also donated the money they had prepared for marriage, it actually took only more than a year to complete all the tasks in excess. A total of 24,460,000 yuan was donated, which can build 41 tractor stations of various types. 28 have been built and put into production. After all of them are completed, it is estimated that nearly 3 million mu of land can be cultivated annually. Voluntary labor to support agricultural production and national construction has been widely carried out in the whole army. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 20 million workdays were spent on voluntary labor by the whole army last year. Most troops have established a regular contact system with local agricultural cooperatives and signed long-term contracts to help with labor. Last year, the troops stationed in areas affected by natural disasters suspended their exercises and went all out to carry out disaster relief. The number of troops participating in flood control alone was 300,000, with more than 1 million workdays, dispatching 240 aircraft, more than 1,000 vehicles, and more than 1,000 large and small rubber boats, rescuing more than 40,000 people and many other materials. In serious and critical situations, many comrades handed over their Party and League dues, preparing to sacrifice themselves to protect the interests of the people. For example, last year, eight officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou troops sacrificed their lives to rescue victims; Deputy Platoon Leader Lei Daxiang was exhausted after completing three rescue missions. In order to save more victims, he insisted on rescuing, and finally died gloriously after being swept away by the flood due to physical exhaustion. The masses said gratefully: "Only our own army would rescue us so desperately!" Last year, the navy dispatched more than 1,700 ship sorties, protecting the safe production of 2.5 million fishermen and more than 100,000 fishing boats, and escorting nearly 200 merchant ships to sail safely. In the peak salt production season, the troops in the Beijing and Shenyang areas mobilized entire regiments and battalions to help salt farms harvest and transport salt, contributing 150,000 workdays and transporting 300,000 tons of salt. The army squeezed out appropriate time to participate in labor production and support national socialist construction while carrying out intensive combat training and garrison tasks, which helped to improve the political awareness of the troops, strengthened the relationship between the army and the people, and increased national wealth. The broad masses of officers and soldiers called this "killing three birds with one stone." In order to strive for a bumper harvest and a great leap forward in agricultural production this year, many troops have decided to squeeze out more workdays to help farmers produce, provided that it does not hinder training and defense tasks. Now, various troops are contacting the Party and government organs and agricultural cooperatives in their驻地 (translator: "stationed areas"), formulating specific plans for participating in national construction and agricultural production in 1958 with water conservancy construction as the center under the unified leadership of the local Party committees. For example, the Guangzhou troops have planned to contribute 4.3 million workdays, the Nanjing troops plan to contribute 4.2 million workdays, and the Fujian front-line troops have also decided to support 2.25 million workdays in their驻地 in the midst of intensive combat readiness training. The troops stationed in Beijing have decided to contribute 400,000 workdays this spring and summer to support the construction project of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. The number of workdays reported by each unit has exceeded the quota allocated by Beijing Municipality, exceeding the quota by more than 100,000 workdays. Everyone is very enthusiastic and determined to work with the people of the capital to strive to basically complete all the projects before the flood season.

In the past three months, 410,000 family members of military officers have returned to their hometowns to engage in production, and another 200,000 family members will return to their hometowns one after another around the Spring Festival.

Since November last year, the army has decided to mobilize the family members of military officers to return to their hometowns to engage in production and employment. This is a measure with revolutionary significance, which is very beneficial to increasing the rural labor force, to army building, and to the military officers' family members themselves. Therefore, it has been warmly supported by the broad masses of military officers and their family members. As of the end of January this year, in the three months, the number of family members who returned to their hometowns to engage in production has reached more than 410,000, and it is estimated that another 200,000 family members will return to their hometowns one after another around the Spring Festival. After the family members of military officers returned to their hometowns, the Party and government and agricultural cooperatives in various places earnestly and responsibly helped them solve the problems of housing, food, joining the cooperatives, production, and children's enrollment in schools. Some places also helped the military family members to formulate specific plans for settling down and production. Many family members actively participated in production the day after they returned to their hometowns. Bai Wenrong, the wife of a military officer in the Military Service Bureau of a county in Henan, participated in the construction of farmland water conservancy after returning home, and invested her savings in the cooperative, which was praised by the people. She was recently elected as the director of the agricultural cooperative. The masses reflected that "the army has sent us a group of labor backbones," which has a very good impact.

Comrade representatives: "Our cause is an arduous cause. To build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science is an unprecedented feat. To complete such a feat, there will be difficulties. The question is what attitude we take towards difficulties." In our People's Liberation Army, there are these words: "No matter how difficult the task is, as long as we have a clear understanding of the ideas, we will be more energetic, we will have more ways, any difficulties will be conquered by us, and any enemy will be defeated by us!" Let us, in the year of the new leap forward in socialist construction in the motherland, stir up revolutionary enthusiasm and forge ahead hand in hand!

　　坚持勤俭建军方针  积极参加国家建设
    甘泗淇代表的发言
    我完全同意大会的各项报告。仅谈谈勤俭建军和军队参加国家社会主义建设的问题。
    今年是我国进入第二个五年计划的头一年，全国人民正在朝气蓬勃地本着“多、快、好、省”的建设方针，热烈响应党中央的号召，争取在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国；在农业上争取大跃进、大丰收，尽早地实现农业发展纲要四十条。最近以来，各行各业捷报频传。人民解放军全体官兵都为此感到欢欣鼓舞。为实现这一宏伟目标，军队正加紧战斗训练，警惕地保卫国防，并坚持勤俭建军的方针，积极参加国家的社会主义建设。
    去年一年，全体官兵节约了粮食六千多万斤，马料四千一百万斤，炊事用煤五万多吨，服装二百七十七万套，棉花三百七十九万斤；生产了蔬菜二万一千六百五十万斤，谷物和油料七百四十万斤，猪二十多万头，牛羊十一万头。
    大家知道，为了把国家资金主要用在经济建设方面，从第一个五年计划的第一年起，国家预算中的国防费，每年都有所减少。一九五三年国防费用是六十一亿七千六百四十四万元，占国家当年总予算的百分之二十八点八七；一九五七年国防费支出是五十五亿二千三百三十二万元，占国家总预算的百分之十八点八五；今年国防费预算五十亿元，已下降到国家总预算的百分之十五点一二。那末，这样会不会影响到国防建设和军队建设呢？我们说，不会的。正如李先念副总理报告中所说的，我们的军队是人民的军队，我们应该完全有志气和决心，花最少的钱，作最多的事。去年国防费比前年减少了几亿元，但是由于我们贯彻执行了勤俭建军的方针和厉行节约的结果，仍然完成了既定的建设计划和训练任务，节约了经费及其他物资折价共七千四百五十万元。去年，粮食、煤炭一度紧张，全体官兵就节约了粮食六千多万斤，马料四千一百万斤，炊事用煤五万多吨；去年棉布、棉花供应紧张，全体官兵俭穿节用，节约了二百七十七万套单、棉衣，三百七十九万斤棉花；去年市场上的副食品供应也比较紧张，军队除了在春节少买年货、肉食外，自种收获的蔬菜就有二万一千六百五十万斤，谷物和油料作物七百四十万斤，养猪二十多万口（部队已宰杀食用的猪肉一千多万斤除外），牛羊十一万头。这对于保证部队需要，减少市场上的供应，都起了一些作用。为了照顾群众生产，密切军民关系，去年各个部队还紧缩了军事用地十七万五千余亩，退还了租用的民房七万二千四百多间，退还公房四十二万多平方米。军队现已规定，除有些部队确实需要的，可继续租用民房外，一般不再租用民房。今年根据整改中群众鸣放的意见，仅降低现行供给标准、调整和撤销一些不必要的建筑工程项目、减缩部分业务计划开支等三项，就可压缩预算二万二千七百一十五万元，从供给标准上确定今年起每人每天减少一两粮食、六两煤炭；军官服装质量降低，使用年限也延长；营房建筑基本上停止；退还租用的民房和公房后，也可节省一笔租赁费和修理费。从目前军队展开的反浪费运动来看，军队中浪费的现象是普遍存在的，有的还很严重。广大官兵正在进行专题鸣放，继续千方百计地挖潜力、想办法，节省军费开支；各个部门也在根据少花钱多办事的原则，考虑把有限的军费用在最必需最有用的方面，制定各项工作具体计划，健全和建立一些必要的制度，以杜绝浪费。因此，我们说，减少几亿元的国防费，不仅是必要的，而且是可行的。
    公债认购年年超额完成；捐款建立的拖拉机站可耕土地三百万亩；支援农业生产和国家建设的义务劳动去年一年出工近二千万个；参加防汛救灾的部队达三十万人。
    其次，再谈一谈军队支援国家社会主义建设的一些情况。军队广大成员，对支援国家建设一向是热情的、积极的。以购买公债为例，从一九五四年到一九五七年的四年中，军队超额完成国家分配认购的公债的平均数达百分之六十六点二八；今年军官人数虽有减少，多子女补助费取消，公债又有增加，但很多部队都已超额完成，有的单位超过分配数字达百分之二百。许多同志表示：“买公债是向未来幸福生活投资，只要祖国社会主义建设得好，眼下再艰苦些也不算啥！”这种热情还表现在支援农业合作化、农业生产和防汛抗旱、抢险救灾等方面。军队发起的建立拖拉机站的捐款任务，原先预定三年完成，由于许多同志把自己的积蓄拿出来认捐，有的同志把准备结婚用的钱也捐了出来，实际上只有一年多的时间，即全部超额完成。共捐款二千四百四十六万元，可建各种类型的拖拉机站四十一个，已建成并投入生产的有二十八个，全部建成后预计可年耕土地近三百万亩。支援农业生产和国家建设的义务劳动，已在全军普遍展开。据不完全统计，去年全军参加义务劳动出工近二千万个，大多数部队和当地农业社建立了经常的联系制度，订立了帮助劳动的长期合同。去年在受了自然灾害地区的驻军，许多都停止操课，全力进行抢险救灾。仅参加防汛的部队即有三十万人，出工达一百余万个，出动飞机二百四十架次，汽车千余辆，大小橡皮船千余只，拯救了四万多人的生命及其他许多物资。在险情严重、危急的情况下，许多同志交出了党、团费，准备为保卫人民利益而牺牲自己。如去年广州部队即有八个官兵为营救遇难群众而献出了生命；副排长雷达祥同志完成三次抢救任务后已精疲力尽，他为了使更多的灾民脱险，仍坚持抢救，终因体力不支，被洪水冲走而光荣牺牲。群众感激的说：“只有咱们自己的军队，才会这样不顾生死地抢救咱们！”海军去年一年出动了舰艇一千七百余艘次，保护了二百五十万渔民、十万多条渔船安全生产，并护送了近二百艘商船安全航行。北京、沈阳地区的部队，在产盐旺季，曾调动整团、整营的部队，帮助盐场抢收抢运，出工十五万个劳动日，运盐三十万吨。军队在执行紧张的战斗训练和警备任务中，挤出适当的时间，参加劳动生产，支援国家社会主义建设，既有助于提高部队的政治觉悟，又密切了军民关系，也增加了国家财富，广大官兵对此称之为“一举三得”。为了争取今年农业生产的大丰收、大跃进，许多部队决定，在不妨碍训练和守备任务的条件下，准备挤出更多的劳动日，帮助农民生产。现在各个部队正和驻地党、政机关及农业社联系，在各地党委的统一领导下，制订以水利建设为中心的一九五八年参加国家建设和农业生产的具体规划。如广州部队已计划出工四百三十万个劳动日，南京部队计划出工四百二十万个劳动日，福建前线部队在紧张的战备训练中，也决定支援驻地二百二十五万个劳动日。驻京部队已决定今年春夏两季出工四十万个劳动日，支援十三陵水库建设工程，各单位自报的出工人数已超过北京市分配的定额，多出了十余万个劳动日，大家的干劲很大，决心与首都人民一起，争取在汛期前基本完成全部工程。
    三个月来，已有四十一万军官家属还乡生产，春节前后还将有二十万家属陆续回乡。
    从去年十一月起，军队决定动员军官家属还乡生产，劳动就业。这是一项具有革命意义的措施，这对于增加农村劳动力，对于军队建设和军官家属本人都很有好处。因此，受到广大军官和家属的热烈拥护。到今年一月底止，三个月的时间还乡生产的家属已达到四十一万余人，预计春节前后，还将有二十万家属陆续回乡。军官家属还乡后，各地党和政府及农业合作社都认真负责地帮助她们解决住房、吃粮、入社、生产及子女入学等问题，有的地方还帮助军人家属订立安家生产的具体计划。许多家属回家乡后的第二天就积极投入生产。河南某县兵役局一个军官的爱人白文荣同志，到家后就参加了兴修农田水利工作，把自己的节余投入合作社，得到人民群众的赞扬，最近已被选为农业社社长。群众反映说：“军队给我们送来了一批劳动骨干”，影响很好。
    各位代表：“我们的事业是艰巨的事业，要把我国建设成为一个拥有现代化工业，现代化农业和现代文化科学的社会主义强国，是前无古人的壮举，要完成这样的壮举，不会没有困难，问题是在于我们对于困难采取什么态度。”在我们人民解放军中有这么几句话：“管他是什么艰巨的任务，只要思想搞通了，劲头就大了，办法也就有了，任何困难，都会被我们征服，任何敌人都是会被我们打败的！”让我们在祖国社会主义建设新跃进的一年中，鼓起革命干劲，并肩携手奋勇前进吧！
