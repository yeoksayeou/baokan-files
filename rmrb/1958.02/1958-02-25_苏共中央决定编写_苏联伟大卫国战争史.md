    CPSU Central Committee Decides to Compile "History of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union"
    The Soviet journal "Problems of History" published an article by Bao Erting, Deputy Director of the Marxist-Leninist Institute of the CPSU Central Committee, in its 11th issue of 1957, entitled "Important Tasks of Soviet Historians." The main content of the article is as follows:
    The CPSU Central Committee has decided that five volumes of "History of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, 1941-1945" will be published successively from 1957 to 1960. The compilation of this politically and scientifically significant work is an important task for Soviet historians.
    The war of 1941-1945 was a major event in Soviet and world history. Obviously, studying the history of this war has great political and educational significance for the Soviet people and all progressive humanity.
    The political and scientific significance of compiling the "History of the Great Patriotic War" is greatly enhanced because bourgeois propagandists and historians are desperately trying to belittle the significance of the Soviet victory, diminish the Soviet Union's role in crushing fascism, and fabricate the history of this war. Their central idea is to try to explain that the failure of German fascism in the war was not due to the superiority of the Soviet social and state system, nor to the superiority of Soviet military art, but to the fact that Hitler did not heed the advice of "wise" generals and made personal mistakes. In numerous "works," Anglo-American scholars insist that the Anglo-American armed forces played a decisive role in defeating fascist Germany and imperialist Japan. Refuting these fabrications and scientifically and comprehensively analyzing facts and documents to show the true situation of the war is also an important task in compiling the "History of the Great Patriotic War."
    In the decade or so since the war, Soviet academic circles have conducted some research on this heroic history. They have collected and sorted out factual materials, compiled scientific works, and published popular readings. However, this is only the beginning for compiling a monumental work that deeply studies and fully understands the entire history of the Great Patriotic War and the world-historical significance of the Soviet victory.
    The "History of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union" should be an academic work written with in-depth analysis from a Marxist perspective. All aspects of the history of the 1941-1945 war will be deeply analyzed and fully explained in this work.
    In order to lead the compilation of the "History of the Great Patriotic War," the CPSU Central Committee has organized an editorial board, which includes representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, research institutions, and social organizations, as well as famous historians, chaired by Academician P.N. Pospelov, alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee. The direct work of writing the book is carried out by the Marxist-Leninist Institute of the CPSU Central Committee, which has established a special Great Patriotic War History Group. To help scientific cadres study wartime issues, the group will compile a five-volume collection of wartime historical documents; in addition, to meet the needs of the general readership, especially workers, collective farmers, and youth, a popular one-volume "History of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, 1941-1945" will also be compiled.

    苏共中央决定编写“苏联伟大卫国战争史”
    苏联“历史问题”1957年十一期上，发表了苏共中央马列学院副院长包尔亭的“苏联史学家的重要任务”的文章，文章的主要内容如下：
    苏共中央决定：在1957至1960年，将陆续出版五卷“1941至1945年苏联伟大卫国战争史”。这部富有政治、科学意义的著作的编写，是苏联史学家的重要任务。
    1941至1945年的战争，是苏联史和世界史中的重大事件。很显然，研究这次战争的历史，对于苏联人民以及整个进步人类，都有着巨大的政治意义和教育意义。
    编写“伟大卫国战争史”的政治、科学意义之所以大为增长，是因为资产阶级的宣传家和史学家拼命要贬低苏联取得胜利的意义，缩小苏联在粉碎法西斯主义中的作用，而捏造这次战争的历史。他们的中心思想，是企图说明德国法西斯主义在战争中遭到失败，似乎并不是由于苏联社会制度和国家制度的优越性，也不是由于苏联军事艺术的优越性，而是由于希特勒没有注意“英明”将领的忠告，他个人犯了错误。英美学者在大量的“著作”中，硬说英美的武装力量在战胜法西斯德国和帝国主义日本当中起了决定性的作用。驳斥这些捏造，科学、全面地分析事实和文献，从而表明大战真实的情况——这也是编写“伟大卫国战争史”的重要任务。
    战后十多年来，苏联史学界对这段英勇的历史进行过一些研究。他们曾收集整理事实材料，编写科学著作，出版普及读物。但是，对于编写一部深入研究和全面了解伟大卫国战争的全部历史和苏联取得胜利的世界历史意义的巨著来说，这仅仅是个开始。
    “苏联伟大卫国战争史”，应当是一部用马克思主义观点进行深入分析而写成的学术著作。1941至1945年战争史的各个方面，在这部著作里，都将得到深刻的分析和全面的说明。
    为了领导“伟大卫国战争史”的编写工作，苏共中央组织了编辑委员会，其中包括国防部、外交部、研究机关和社会团体的代表以及著名的史学家，由苏共中央主席团候补委员、党中央书记Ⅱ·Н·波斯伯洛夫院士担任主席。直接编写本书的工作，由苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院进行，该院已成立一个专门的伟大卫国战争史组。为了帮助科学干部研究战时的问题，该组将编纂五卷战争史文献；此外，为了满足广大读者特别是工人、农庄庄员和青年的需要，还编写一卷通俗的“1941至1945年苏联伟大卫国战争史”。　（全地）
