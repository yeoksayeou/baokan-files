    Secretaries Take Action, The Whole People Mobilize, More, Faster, Better, and More Economical, Develop Industry.
    Yuxi Prefecture Rural Five-Year Modernization:
    Farmland Water Conservancy, Agricultural Semi-Mechanization, Rural Electrification, Fertilizer Chemicalization
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 23rd - Yunnan Province's Yuxi Prefecture plans to basically achieve farmland water conservancy, agricultural semi-mechanization, rural electrification, and fertilizer chemicalization within five years.  With the exception of farmland water conservancy, which will be basically completed next year, the other three modernizations will be gradually completed during the Second Five-Year Plan period.  To this end, the local Party committee has formulated an ambitious local industrial development plan. By 1962, the region will produce tens of thousands of tons of steel annually, and local industry will be able to supply agriculture with gas tractors and various agricultural machinery.  Annual chemical fertilizer production will reach 400,000 tons, and the fertilizer application rate for each mu of cultivated land in the region will be 156 kilograms.  Rural hydroelectric power stations and power machinery supplied by local industries will basically provide electricity to rural areas.

    According to the plan, 125 new and expanded factories and mines will be built within five years.  These include eleven large sugar factories with a daily crushing capacity of 350 tons, a synthetic ammonia plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons, a steel plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons, as well as copper mines, coal mines, lead mines, etc.  It is estimated that by 1962, the total industrial output value of the region will reach 360 million yuan, a fourteen-fold increase over 1957, exceeding the region's total agricultural output value.

    Yuxi Prefecture is a region in Yunnan Province where local industry has developed relatively quickly and well, and it already has a certain foundation. Based on past experience and lessons, the local Party committee has determined that it will use modern industry invested in by the state as the backbone, combined with local small-scale enterprises, handicrafts, and industrial workshops run concurrently by agricultural cooperatives.  One "foreign" (modern) leads a large number of "native" (traditional) methods, adopting the method of "the old hen laying eggs," gradually expanding to form a mass local industrial network where every county has industry, every township has industry, and every cooperative has industry. This will organically link industry and agricultural and sideline production, large enterprises and small enterprises, and workshops together.

    The plan is formulated according to local conditions and based on local resources. Among the eleven counties in the region, Jinning, Jiangchuan, and Huaning counties have large quantities of high-quality phosphate mines. Yuxi, Huaning, Eshan and other counties have abundant limestone, lignite and other raw materials for manufacturing nitrogen and potash fertilizers. Many counties have copper, coal, asbestos and other mineral deposits. Iron ore is available in almost every county, and the known reserves in Yimen and Jinning counties alone amount to 30 million tons. These abundant resources guarantee that it is entirely possible to realize the plan.

    Whether the region's plan can be completed hinges on this year.  This year, 74 new and expanded factories and mines will be built. The total industrial output value of the region will increase by 245% compared to last year.  At present, bacterial fertilizer factories, copper mines, etc. have been put into production, Yuanjiang Sugar Factory, Huaning Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, etc. are ready for infrastructure construction, and steel plants, etc. have begun design.

    书记动手　全民动员　多快好省　发展工业
    玉溪专区农村五年现代化
    农田水利化　农业半机械化　农村电气化　肥料化学化
    新华社昆明23日电　云南省玉溪专区计划在五年内基本上达到农田水利化、农业半机械化、农村电气化和肥料化学化。除农田水利化明年基本上完成以外，其他三化将在第二个五年计划期间陆续完成。为此，当地党委已制订出宏伟的地方工业发展规划。到1962年，全区将年产钢铁十几万吨，地方工业能供应农业以煤气拖拉机和各种农业机械。化学肥料年产量将达四十万吨，全区每亩耕种面积的施肥量可有一百五十六公斤。农村水电站和地方工业供应的动力机械将使农村基本上都有电力。
    根据规划，五年之内将新建和扩建一百二十五个厂矿。其中有十一个日榨三百五十吨的大型糖厂、年产十万吨的合成氨厂、年产四万吨的炼钢厂以及铜矿、煤矿、铅矿等。预计到1962年时，全区工业总产值将达到三亿六千万元，在1957年的基础上翻了十四翻，超过全区农业总产值。
    玉溪专区是云南省地方工业发展得较快较好的地区，地方工业已有一定基础。根据过去的经验和教训，当地党委确定，将以国家投资的现代化工业为骨干，结合地方小型企业、手工业和农业社兼营的工业作坊，一个洋的带一大堆土的，采取老母鸡下蛋，逐步扩大的发展方法，形成一个县县有工业、乡乡有工业、社社有工业的群众性的地方工业网。使工业和农副业、大型企业和小型企业、作坊有机地连在一起。
    规划是因地制宜根据当地资源制定的。全区十一个县中，晋宁、江川、华宁等县有量多质优的磷矿。玉溪、华宁、峨山等县有制造氮肥和钾肥的丰富石灰石、褐煤等原料。很多县都有铜、煤、石棉等矿藏。铁矿几乎县县都有，仅易门和晋宁两县已知的蕴藏量就有三千万吨。这些丰富的资源保证完全有可能实现规划。
    全区的规划能否完成关键在于今年。今年新建和扩建七十四个厂矿。全区的工业生产总值比去年增加245％。现在，细菌肥料厂、铜矿等已投入生产，元江糖厂、华宁磷肥厂等已准备基建，炼钢厂等已开始设计。
