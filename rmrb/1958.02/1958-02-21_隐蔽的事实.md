    Concealed Facts
    The editorial department of the American "International News Service" issued an internal notice on February 18, instructing its reporters to add a "concealed fact" when reporting on the defection of a South Korean airliner: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea intended to detain the passengers on the plane as "hostages" to force the South Korean authorities to hold direct talks.
    The editorial department of the "International News Service" is tens of thousands of miles away from Korea, so how could it be so magically powerful as to know "facts" that its reporters in Korea didn't know? It's not surprising. This is just a common trick used by American news agencies to carry out distorted propaganda. However, because the "fact" it speaks of is simply not a fact, it can only be called a "concealed fact."
    From the "International News Service's" fabrication of "concealed facts," people can see one clear fact: the United States is currently in a state of utter embarrassment regarding the Korean issue, so it wants to seize upon the airliner defection incident to wantonly distort the situation and make a big fuss in order to divert everyone's attention.

    隐蔽的事实
    美国“国际新闻社”编辑部在2月18日发了一个内部通报，要它的记者在报道南朝鲜一架民航机起义事件时，加入一个“隐蔽的事实”：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要扣留这架飞机上的乘客作为“人质”，来迫使南朝鲜当局举行直接谈判。
    “国际新闻社”的编辑部远离朝鲜十万八千里，怎么居然神通广大到能够知道它在朝鲜采访的记者所不知道的“事实”呢？说来也并不奇怪。这不过是美国通讯社进行歪曲宣传的一种惯用伎俩而已。但是，由于它所说的“事实”根本不是事实，因此只好名之曰“隐蔽的事实”。
    从“国际新闻社”制造“隐蔽的事实”这件事，人们倒可以看到一件明白的事实：美国目前在朝鲜问题上窘态毕露，于是就想抓住民航机起义事件来肆意歪曲，大做文章，以转移大家的视线。
