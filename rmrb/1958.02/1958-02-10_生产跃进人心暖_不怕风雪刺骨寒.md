　　Production Leap Forward Warms Hearts, Not Afraid of Bone-Chilling Wind and Snow
　　Bayanhu Representative Introduces the Enthusiasm of the Masses in Zhaoyuan County

　　Mountains and rivers can be changed, and a leap forward is not difficult. We must jump decisively and fiercely. This year, we will jump to the north of the Yellow River, in three years we will jump to the south of the Yellow River, and within ten years we will cross the Yangtze River. If there is not enough manure, we can accumulate more. If the seeds are not pure, we can carefully select them. If there is not enough animal power, we can start "Yellow Cattle Training Classes." If there is not enough time, we can work from dawn till dusk.

　　I wholeheartedly support the various reports of the conference and will conscientiously implement them. I would like to report on the situation in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, in striving for a county-wide yield of 400 jin per mu in 1958.

　　The high tide of production in our county was launched under the following two circumstances. First, in 1957, the whole county suffered a particularly severe flood disaster. Forty-two percent of the cooperatives and more than 200 villages were flooded, as well as more than 18,000 houses; 43 percent of the farmland was destroyed. Disaster victims accounted for 50 percent of the county's agricultural population. Second, last winter, there was a rare heavy snowfall of more than three chi deep. The weather was also much colder than in previous winters, with the ground frozen more than four chi deep and water freezing instantly.

　　Under these circumstances, can we launch a high tide of production, can we make a leap forward? At that time, there were two views: One was that, after analyzing and comparing the subjective and objective conditions, it was believed that a great leap forward was possible; the other was that Heilongjiang is the northernmost part of the motherland, with ice and snow, a short frost-free period, only one crop per year, little human and animal power, little fertilizer, heavy burdens, and frequent droughts and floods, so it was believed that a leap forward was impossible. These comrades only saw the difficult side, the negative side, lacked investigation and research into the actual changing situation, lacked a comprehensive analysis of the new situation, and did not see the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and therefore had conservative ideas. Of course, the disaster was very serious, and there were many difficulties. However, under the correct leadership and close concern of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, after the disaster, extensive efforts were made to carry out production self-salvation and rebuild homes. After more than two months of hard struggle, the floodwater was drained, new houses were built, cooperatives were restored to their original state, and cattle, horses, and sheep were brought back to the villages. At the same time, the state also provided the necessary assistance and relief, and the enthusiasm of the disaster victims for production self-salvation was greatly encouraged. Now, the income of some disaster-stricken societies has reached the income level of general societies before the disaster, and most disaster-stricken societies are expected to catch up with the income level of general societies before the disaster in the first quarter. Therefore, the production upsurge in the disaster areas and the production preparations for 1958 were also rapidly carried out. Here, I would like to focus on the winter production upsurge launched to achieve 400 jin per mu for the entire county.

　　Can we make a leap forward?

　　Investigation and research have proved that from 1954 to 1956, more than 650,000 mu of land in the county had achieved a yield of 400 to 600 jin. Among them, not only were there 43,000 mu of soybeans and 8,800 mu of wheat, but also 28,000 mu crossed the Yellow River—reaching 500 to 600 jin; the average yield per mu in the Hongqi Society of Yongli Township reached 600 jin. This is enough to show that Heilongjiang Province can not only achieve 400 jin, but also exceed 400 jin.

　　Why are yields high and low?

　　In the same area, the same crop, the same year, and the same leadership, why is this part of the land high-yielding, while the rest of the land is not? This question was debated extensively in the county People's Congress, the Party Congress, the county's four-level cadre meeting, and in various townships and societies, through extensive airing of views and free debate. In addition to reviewing and recalling that the past leadership was insufficient and needed to be caught up with urgently, the main reasons for the increased production of the land that had achieved 400 jin per mu were summarized in eighteen characters: good water conservancy, abundant manure, superior seeds, full seedlings, few pests, and careful cultivation. Three analyses were made for land that did not achieve 400 jin: (1) Low-lying areas are subject to flood attacks during the flood season, water accumulates during the rainy season, the soil is strongly alkaline, and the penetration is poor. The cumulative area of crop failure due to flooding in the county in the past eight years was 1.8 million mu, which is equivalent to the county harvesting one year less in eight years, resulting in a loss of about 400 million jin of grain; (2) Sandy areas have barren soil, drought and water shortage, and the soil contains little organic matter and lime, resulting in too low yields; (3) Plain areas have better soil, with organic matter content accounting for about 13 percent, but the amount of fertilizer applied each year is small, only about 2,000 jin per mu, and in addition, there is little rain in spring and more rain in autumn, with uneven droughts and floods, affecting increased production.

　　After the county test-planted 360 mu of high-yield rice in 1955, rice cultivation developed to 60,000 mu in 1957, which both increased production and relieved flooding; the Hongwei Society built a 30-li long drainage, storage, and flood control project, and the entire society's 33,000 mu of land had a bumper harvest; the Xinchan Township built a 40-li long project, protecting 30,000 mu of low-lying land from waterlogging. The fact that the more than 350 kilometers of water conservancy projects that have been carried out throughout the county have achieved varying degrees of results proves that the main reason for not achieving higher results is the lack of comprehensive management measures for prevention, control, and utilization, as well as measures from left to right and top to bottom.

　　Finding the Key to Increasing Production, Vigorously Mobilizing the Masses

　　After grasping the key, the county People's Congress and the Party Congress made resolutions respectively, unanimously agreeing that we must make the greatest determination, take out the revolutionary spirit, thoroughly mobilize the masses, and launch a great leap forward in production centered on water and fertilizer, quickly turn water damage into water conservancy, and strive to achieve 400 jin per mu in 1958. With the guarantee of the county's three-level Party organizations, the county's four-level cadre meeting attended by more than 2,500 people agreed: "Mountains and rivers can be changed, and a leap forward is not difficult. We must jump decisively and fiercely. This year, we will jump to the north of the Yellow River, in three years we will jump to the south of the Yellow River, and within ten years we will cross the Yangtze River. If there is not enough manure, we can accumulate more. If the seeds are not pure, we can carefully select them. If there is not enough animal power, we can start 'Yellow Cattle Training Classes.' If there is not enough time, we can work from dawn till dusk." In short, everyone agreed that difficulties cannot stop heroes. Men and women, old and young, work together. Whatever difficulties there are, we will overcome them. The spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was further publicized from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses. The broad masses of farmers have widely studied and enthusiastically discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) through the formulation of the 1958 production plan. As a result, the countryside became even more boiling, people's hearts were boosted, and the enthusiasm became greater and greater. The masses said, "The leap forward in production warms the hearts, not afraid of the bone-chilling wind and snow." Despite the rare heavy snowfall of more than three chi deep and the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, the masses were mobilized in a timely manner, regardless of men, women, old, and young. The upsurge quickly took shape. Its characteristics are: cadres are determined, the masses are enthusiastic, the scope of action is wide, the number of participants is large, the work progress is fast, and the production quality is good. In the past two months, the number of participants has reached 130,000, accounting for 51 percent of the county's population. 2.7 million tons of manure have been accumulated, accounting for 90 percent of the plan (400 percent of 1957), and 1.4 million tons of winter manure have been sent out (equal to 200 percent of the total amount of fertilizer applied in 1957). More than 26,000 toilets have been built, more than 45,000 urine pits have been dug, more than 2,800 horse sheds have been built, 10,000 mu of soil have been improved, 500,000 mu of frozen stubble have been dragged, more than 500 wells have been drilled, and 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork for flood control, drainage, and paddy fields have been completed. The frozen layer of land is more than four chi deep, and the large pickaxe is broken. If it is broken, another one is replaced. The farmers said, "One pickaxe doesn't move, the second pickaxe is as hard as steel... After five or six pickaxes, cracks appear, and after eight or nine pickaxes, the basket is full"; "Don't look at the ground frozen four chi deep, freezing hands and feet but not freezing the heart. The pickaxe is harder than the ground, and the heart is harder than the pickaxe." For example, the hands of member Cao Kuiwu were broken with five cracks. He sewed them up with thread, wrapped them in cloth, took off his cotton-padded jacket, and was still sweating profusely. He said: We are not afraid of difficulties, we can shed blood and sweat, and we must harvest 400 jin per mu. The Zhao Jin group of members completed an average of six cubic meters of frozen soil per person per day (exceeding the amount of earthwork per day in summer), which aroused many members to learn from their advanced records and enthusiasm, and challenged them. In order to work together day and night, the farmers created fast, good, and economical "ice lamps." Looking from afar along the Songhua River, it seems like a winding Great Wall, but it is actually the ice lamps of tens of thousands of farmers working the night shift. Red flags flutter during the day, and lights shine brightly at night. They said: We resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, take out our sincere strength to engage in a great leap forward in production, quickly turn Heilongjiang into a granary for our motherland that produces more grain, cross the Yellow River in three years, and cross the Yangtze River in ten years. This heroic feeling has become the action goal of all farmers in the county. For example, the two townships of Heping and Laohubei drilled more than 60 wells in three to five days, regardless of the cold weather, squatting in two chi deep well water to dig mud. The 4,000 mu paddy field trunk line project of the Yanhai Society, planned for 15 days, was completed in seven days and seven nights. The three-li long trunk line project of Laohubei Township was completed by men, women, old, and young in three days and three nights. Therefore, many old farmers said: The winter of "Beidahuang" has also become spring; the black sky has become day, and old men are as good as young men. Due to the simultaneous advancement of various production tasks, coupled with the huge increase in production disaster relief and manure quantity, the vehicles and horses are too busy. If the manure is not sent out in winter, the fertilization plan will be missed. In order to solve this difficulty, women have also put in tremendous labor. In addition to a large amount of fertilizer accumulation and seed selection, they have also participated in the winter manure delivery campaign. Taking Yukuai Township as an example, there are 467 women pulling 120 sleds to deliver winter manure; after women in Yongli Township used a lot of manpower to deliver manure, the 40-day manure delivery plan will be shortened. Due to the transformation of winter leisure into winter busy, the utilization rate of plowing horses has increased. Due to the impact of the disaster and the heavy production tasks in 1958, there is a general feeling of insufficient feed. The results of the pilot project in key townships and societies proved that a campaign to excavate substitute feed can be launched throughout the county to alleviate the difficulty of insufficient feed. After a comprehensive mobilization, in less than 30 days, 8,500 tons of substitute feed were produced, with an average of about 550 jin accumulated for each plowing horse. At the same time, on this basis, after class friendship, mutual assistance, and mutual aid education, four non-disaster townships helped one severely disaster-stricken township, and the method of contracting assistance was adopted to solve the four severely disaster-stricken townships that lacked horse feed. It is estimated that by the end of February, each plowing horse in the county can get an average of 700 jin of substitute feed. In order to resolutely complete the county's fertilizer accumulation plan, many agricultural societies themselves proposed the slogan "Dig out the bottom of the bubble, push down the old wall roots, turn over all manure sources, and resolutely achieve 400 jin." Some societies dug up the ice layer more than three chi deep and dug mud from the bottom of the bubble to collect manure (containing years of humus), and launched the fertilizer accumulation campaign of "digging out the manure pit, finding all manure sources, and cleaning up the toilet; sweeping the streets, picking up all manure eggs, cleaning up the animal pens, city manure going to the countryside; the stove, the kang hole, the grinding table, the well platform, the old urine nest, and the broken door frame should all be turned over." Grandmothers in their 70s and grandfathers in their 80s also led their grandsons and granddaughters to pick up manure. Getting up in the morning, you can see fertilizer accumulators picking up urine from door to door in the society and team. Most farmers' homes have set up chamber pots, and the habit of picking up manure in the morning has become a common practice among men, women, old, and young, students, and cadres. This situation has never happened in our area before. The Hongwei Society compiled a ditty for Aunt Li: ...Snow is three chi deep and the north wind is blowing, women are accumulating manure without stopping. There is an aunt whose surname is Li, over sixty-four winters old; women elected her as the group leader, and she is willing to lead the troops, picking up manure better than young men, no less than Mu Guiying in those years.... Two newly married couples in Dongda Society, Toutai Township, did not enter the bridal chamber that night in order to resolutely complete the day's assault task. They said: "In order to be busy with the leap forward in production, we will not enter the bridal chamber first." There are also many examples of brothers competing and uncles and nephews competing. It can be seen that after the socialist debate and the study and discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program in our county's rural areas, as well as under the encouragement and promotion of the leap forward in production in various parts of the country, the socialist consciousness has been unprecedentedly improved. A political enthusiasm has greatly promoted the enthusiasm for production, so there is full courage to overcome difficulties, abundant labor enthusiasm, and everywhere there is a united, progressive, lively, and forward-looking atmosphere, which has brought many new customs to the countryside. Farmers express their pure hearts of loving the Party and Chairman Mao, and loving socialism with lively slogans; they also use their practical actions and hardworking hands to change the old appearance of the countryside. On the basis of continuing to adhere to and do a good job in all material, ideological, organizational, and leadership preparations, according to the calculation method of the National Agricultural Development Program, in 1958, we will strive to achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu on 900,000 mu of land in the county. Judging from the completed fertilizer accumulation plan, the amount of fertilizer applied per hectare will be increased from 20,000 jin in the past to 60,000 to 80,000 jin. The area of rice cultivation will be expanded from 60,000 mu in 1957 to 180,000 mu, and the area of mixed planting will reach 600,000 mu. Through rural rectification, society rectification, and Party rectification, as well as the formulation of the 1958 production leap forward plan, each agricultural society has specifically "contracted" the requirements for achieving 400 jin to teams and groups, from land and agricultural tools to the number of plants per mu of crops. Through democratic discussion, the production responsibility system, the land block responsibility system, and the job-specific responsibility system were determined. From the area of various crops to the technology of plowing and planting, dedicated personnel are responsible for it, responsible to the end, responsible for the whole year, and a reward and punishment system is stipulated.

　　Townships and societies must run technical training classes

　　In order to improve the technical level of farmers, so that the broad masses of members can complete the agricultural production tasks in the future with both "courage" and "strategy," through the inspection and summary of the 1952 bumper harvest experience, combined with the production plan, the Yonghe Society of Wafang Township first conducted a nationwide technical training (the main targets are male and female members, society, and team cadres). The main content is centered on the training of basic agricultural knowledge such as crop cultivation techniques, soil, manure, seeds, and plant diseases and insect pests, and is specifically digested through the method of "offering suggestions and strategies," extensive airing of views, and free debate. The pilot results were good and the harvest was great. It not only promoted the production upsurge but also enhanced the confidence in increasing production, raising the planned yield target per mu by 466 jin. Member Xu Bin said: Although I have been engaged in agriculture for so many years, I know too little about agricultural knowledge. Not to mention anything else, I don't understand how to do corn hybrid pollination. This further made the members realize the importance of agricultural technology. Member Song Lao Han said: When Chinese cabbage got worms, everyone said it was the Worm King's fault. I burned incense and offered noodles, but he wouldn't withdraw his troops. This time, I understand the history of these worms. If there are worms again, there will be a way. After such a pilot project, the farmers requested to do two or three times a year, and we also took this work as an important construction work in the countryside to complete. Therefore, on the basis of further strengthening the summary and promotion of the 1952 production increase experience of "preparing the land to conserve moisture, rational close planting, protecting seedlings, increasing fertilizer, and early planting," a nationwide large-scale technical training work was universally carried out in townships and societies throughout the county, which will be fully completed in the first phase after the Spring Festival. In the future, we will closely combine with production needs to carry out two or three technical training sessions every year to improve the technical knowledge of farmers to a better level.

　　Send down cadres, strengthen grassroots leadership

　　In order to strengthen leadership and enrich the grassroots, the township party secretaries and township heads are all held by the ministers of the county party committee and the section chiefs of the county people's committee. The county has sent down 140 district party committee secretaries, district heads, and committee-level cadres to serve as the leaders of the directors and branch secretaries in the county's 170 agricultural societies. The farmers expressed a warm welcome to these old comrades-in-arms who had been with them in production and struggle since the land reform; the cadres who went down also expressed great determination and wrote guarantees. For example, Wang Yong, deputy minister of the Organization Department, said: We will resolutely work in the countryside until we are old for the great cause of the Party and the people. After going to the countryside, we will share weal and woe with the farmers and realize the forty articles ahead of schedule. So after they went down, the enthusiasm of the masses was higher, and the career of the cadres was stronger. Coupled with the transformation and improvement of work methods and work style, all the work has achieved rapid results immediately.

　　Now, the winter production upsurge in our county is developing in depth, but we are never proud, and we must continue to carry out unremitting struggles against right-leaning conservative ideas and old-fashioned views, learn from the advanced experience of various parts of the country, under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly mobilize the masses, grasp the key to increasing production from beginning to end, race against time with selfless labor and the revolutionary perseverance of Yugong removing mountains, put down our airs, get rid of officialdom, work and labor with the farmers, and overcome all difficulties in the way forward. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will work hard with full confidence and contribute all our strength to the great construction cause of our motherland.

　　Please criticize and correct any inappropriate points in the above speech.

　　生产跃进人心暖　不怕风雪刺骨寒
    巴彦胡代表介绍肇源县群众的干劲说
    山河都可改，跃进亦不难。要坚决的跳，狠狠的跳，今年跳到黄河北，三年跳到黄河南，十年之内过长江。粪肥不足可以多攒，种子不纯精挑细选，畜力不足开展“黄牛训练班”，时间不足起早贪黑的干。
    我衷心拥护大会的各项报告，并认真贯彻执行。我仅就黑龙江省肇源县为一九五八年争取全县亩产四百斤的情况汇报一下。
    我们县的生产高潮是处在如下两种情况下开展起来的。第一、一九五七年全县遭受了特大的洪水灾害。淹没百分之四十二的合作社，二百多个屯庄，一万八千多间民房；淹毁百分之四十三的农田。灾民占全县农业人口的百分之五十。第二、去冬降了几十年来少有的三尺多深的大雪。天气也比每年冬天冷的多，冻地四尺多深，滴水成冰。
    在这种情况下，能不能掀起生产高潮，能不能跃进呢？当时有两种看法：一种是，经过对主客观情况的分析对比，认为能够大跃进；另一种是：黑龙江是祖国的最北方，冰天雪地，无霜期短，每年一作，人畜力少，肥料也少，负担地多，旱涝也多，所以认为跃进不可能。这些同志只看到了困难的一面，消极的一面，缺乏对实际变化中的情况进行调查研究，缺乏对新形势的全面分析，没看到广大群众的积极性，因而存在有保守思想。当然灾情是很严重的，困难也不少。但是，在中央和省委的正确领导与亲切关怀下，受灾之后，广泛的发动了生产自救与重建家园的工作。经过二个多月的艰苦斗争，把大水排了出去，新房子又盖起来，合作社又恢复了原状，牛马羊又领回了村庄。同时国家也给予了必要的扶助和救济，灾民生产自救的干劲大受鼓舞，现在一部分灾社的收入，已达到灾前一般社的收入水平，大部分灾社预计在一季度内，赶上灾前一般社的收入水平，所以灾区的生产高潮和一九五八年的生产准备也迅速的搞起来了。这里我想着重谈一下，为全县实现四百斤，掀起的冬季生产高潮的情况。
    到底能不能跃进
    经过调查研究证明：从一九五四至一九五六年的三年中，全县已有六十五万多亩土地的产量实现了四百斤至六百斤。其中不仅有四万三千亩大豆和八千八百多亩小麦，而且有二万八千多亩跨过了黄河——达到了五百斤至六百斤；永利乡红旗社平均亩产达到六百斤。这就足以说明，黑龙江省不仅能够实现四百斤，而且可以超过四百斤。
    为什么产量有高有低
    在同一地区，同一作物，同一年份，同一领导的情况下，为什么这部分土地高产，其余土地产量不高呢？这个问题，曾在县人民代表大会，党代表大会，全县四级干部大会，各乡、社，通过大鸣大放，进行过大辩论。除检查回忆了过去领导不够，急需抓紧赶上去外，对已实现亩产四百斤的土地，就其主要增产原因方面，概括了十八个字：水利好，粪肥多，种子优，禾苗全，病害少，耕作细。对没有实现四百斤的土地，作了三条分析：（一）低洼地带，汛期备受洪水侵袭，雨季积水成灾，土质碱性强、渗透不好。全县累计八年来因涝绝产面积为一百八十万亩，相等于全县在八年中少收一年，约损失四亿斤粮食；（二）沙丘地带，土质贫瘠，干旱缺水，土壤中含有机质和石灰质少，产量太低；（三）平原地带，土质较好，有机物含量占百分之十三左右，但每年施肥量少，每亩仅在两千斤左右，加之春季雨少，秋季雨多，旱涝不均，影响增产。
    从一九五五年全县试种了三百六十亩水稻丰产后，到一九五七年水稻发展到六万亩，既增产又解涝；宏伟社修建了三十里长的排水、蓄水、防水工程后，全社三万三千亩土地丰收了；新站乡修建了四十里长的工程，保护了三万亩洼地免于内涝等事实证明：全县已经进行的三百五十多公里长的水利工程都收到了不同程度的效果。但是没有收到更高效果的主要原因是：缺乏防、治、利等左右上下的全面综合治理措施。
　　找到增产关键，大力发动群众
    关键抓住之后，县人民代表大会和党代表大会都分别的做出了决议，一致认为，必须下定最大的决心，拿出革命的干劲，彻底发动群众，掀起以水粪为中心的生产大跃进，迅速变水害为水利，争取一九五八年每亩实现四百斤。经全县三级党组织的保证，在二千五百多人参加的全县四级干部大会上议定：“山河都可改，跃进也不难。要坚决的跳，狠狠的跳，今年跳到黄河北，三年跳到黄河南，十年之内过长江。粪肥不足可以多攒，种子不纯精挑细选，畜力不足开展‘黄牛训练班’时间不足起早贪黑的干”。总之，大家一致认为：困难挡不住英雄汉，男女老少一齐干，有什么困难克服什么困难。把党的八届三中全会精神，从党内到党外，从干部到群众又进一步作了宣传，广大农民通过制定一九五八年生产计划，普遍的学习和热烈的讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）。由此，农村更加沸腾了，人心振奋了，干劲越来越大了。群众说“生产跃进人心暖，不怕风雪刺骨寒”。虽然冒着几十年来少有的三尺多深的大风雪和零下三十多度的严寒，顺势进行了男女老少齐发动。高潮迅速的形成了。其特点是：干部决心大，群众干劲足，行动范围广，参加人数多，工作进度快，生产质量好。二个月来参加人数达十三万人，占全县人口的百分之五十一。积出粪肥二百七十万吨，占计划的百分之九十（为一九五七年的百分之四百），已送出冬粪一百四十万吨（等于一九五七年全年施肥量的百分之二百），修出厕所两万六千多处，挖出尿坑四万五千多个，盖出马棚两千八百多间，改良土壤一万亩，拖冻槎子五十万亩，打井五百多眼，完成防洪，排涝，水田等土方工程一百二十万方。冻地层四尺多深，大镐刨断了，换一个再刨，农民说：“一镐没刨动，二镐硬如钢……五、六镐后刨裂缝，八、九镐后装满筐”；“别看地冻四尺深，冻手冻脚不冻心，镐比地硬，心比镐还硬”。像社员曹奎五的双手震破五个裂口，他用线缝上，用布包好，脱下棉袄，还干的汗流满面。他说：困难不怕，血汗可流，每亩四百斤不能不收。社员赵金小组每日每人平均完成冻土六立方（超过夏季日土方量），引起了许多社员学习他们的先进纪录和干劲，同他们提出挑战。为了昼夜一齐干，农民创造了多快好省的“冰灯”，从远方沿松花江看去，好像是蜿蜒如蛇的长城，实际就是上万农民干夜班的冰灯。白天红旗招展，夜晚灯火齐明。他们说：坚决响应党中央和毛主席的号召，拿出真心实力来搞生产大跃进，迅速的把黑龙江变成祖国产粮更多的谷仓，三年过黄河，十年跨长江。这种豪迈的心情已经成为全县农民的行动目标。如和平、老虎背两个乡，在三至五天内就打出六十多眼井，不顾天冷，蹲在二尺深的井水里掏泥。沿海社的四千亩水田干线工程，十五天的计划，七天七夜就全部完成。老虎背乡的三里长干线工程，男女老少一齐干，三天三夜完成了。因此许多老农民说：“北大荒”的冬天，也变成了春天；黑天变成了白天，老汉也赛如青年了。由于各项生产任务的齐头并进，加上生产救灾与粪肥数量的巨增，车马过分繁忙，如不抓紧在冬季把粪送出去，将使施肥计划落空。为了解决这个困难，妇女也付出了巨大的劳动，她们除了大量的积肥选种外，并大量的参加了送冬粪运动。仅以愉快乡为例，就有四百六十七名妇女拉着一百二十个爬犁（雪橇）送冬粪；永利乡妇女大量用人力送粪后，将缩短四十天的送粪计划。由于变冬闲为冬忙，耕马的使役率提高，并因受灾的影响与一九五八年生产任务的繁重，普遍感到饲料不足。经过在重点乡社试点的结果证明可以在全县内掀起挖掘代用饲料的运动，以缓和饲料不足的困难。经全面发动后，在不到三十天的时间里，搞出八千五百吨代用饲料，平均为每匹耕马积蓄了五百五十斤左右。同时在这个基础上又经过阶级友爱、互助互济的教育，以四个非灾乡帮助一个重灾乡，采取这样包干帮助的方法解决了四个严重缺马料的灾乡。预计到二月下旬全县每匹耕马平均可搞到七百斤代用饲料。为了坚决完成全县积肥计划，在许多农业社自己提出：“挖出包泡底，推倒老墙根，所有粪源大翻身，坚决实现四百斤”的口号下，有的社把三尺多深的冰层刨开，从泡底挖泥取粪（含多年的腐植质），并开展了“粪坑挖净，粪源找净，厕所起净；大街扫光，粪蛋拣光，畜圈起光，城粪下乡；锅台、炕洞、碾台、井台、老尿窝、破房框都来个大翻身”的积肥运动，七十多岁的奶奶，八十多岁的爷爷也领着孙子、孙女来拣粪。早晨起来可以到处看见社里队里的积肥员按户挑尿，绝大部分农民家里都设置了马桶，男女老少、学生、干部，清晨起来拣粪的习惯已形成风气。这种情况在我们那里过去是没有过的。宏伟社给李大娘编了个顺口溜说：……雪下三尺刮北风，妇女攒粪不消停，有位大娘本姓李，年过六十零四冬；妇女选她当组长，她愿挂帅去领兵，拣粪赛过青年汉，不亚当年穆桂英……。头台乡东大社两对新婚夫妇，为坚决完成当天的突击任务，当晚都没入洞房，他们说：“为了生产跃进忙，我们先不入洞房”。像兄弟争先，叔侄比赛等事例也是很多的。由此可见，我县农村经过社会主义大辩论和农业发展纲要的学习讨论，以及在全国各地生产跃进的鼓舞推动下，社会主义觉悟有了空前的提高，一股政治上的热情，大大的推动着生产的积极性，因而克服困难的勇气十足，劳动积极性充沛，到处都呈现着团结、进步、活泼、前进的朝气，从而给农村带来了许多移风易俗的新气象。农民用生动活泼的口号表示出他们热爱党和毛主席，热爱社会主义的纯朴心情；也用他们的实际行动和勤劳的双手改变着农村的旧模样。在继续坚持做好一切物质、思想、组织、领导等准备工作的基础上，按全国农业发展纲要的计算方法，一九五八年将在全县九十万亩土地上，为争取实现亩产四百斤而奋斗。从现在已完成的积肥计划看，每公顷施肥量将由过去的二万斤，提高到六至八万斤，水稻将由一九五七年的六万亩发展到十八万亩，混种面积将达到六十万亩。并通过农村整风、整社、整党，及制定一九五八年的生产跃进计划，各农业社都把实现四百斤的要求，具体的从土地农具到每亩作物的株数，都分别“包”到队、组。并通过民主讨论确定了生产责任制，地块负责制和工种专责制。从各种作物的面积到扶犁点种的技术，均由专人负责，一包到底，负责全年，规定了奖惩制度。
    乡乡社社都要开办技术训练班
    为了提高农民的技术水平，使广大社员，既有“勇”又有“谋”完成今后农业生产任务，通过一九五二年丰产经验的检查总结，结合生产规划，首先在瓦房乡的永合社进行了全民性的技术训练（主要对象是男女社员，社、队干部）。主要内容以作物栽培技术、土壤、粪肥、种籽、病虫害等农业基本知识的训练为核心，通过“献计献策”，大鸣大放，大辩论的方法具体消化。试点结果，效果良好，收获很大。不仅推动了生产高潮，也增强了增产信心，把原计划亩产指标提高四百六十六斤。社员徐斌说：虽然干这么多年农业，对农业这方面的知识懂得太少，不用说别的，玉米杂交授粉我都不明白怎么搞。从而进一步使社员认识到农业技术的重要性。社员宋老汉说：大白菜起了虫子，都说是虫王见怪，我烧了香，供了面，他也不收兵，这回我算明白这虫子的历史了，再闹虫有办法了。经过这样试点以后，农民要求一年搞二、三次才好，我们也把这个工作当成农村的一项重要建设工作去完成。因此在进一步加强总结推广一九五二年“整地保墒、合理密植、保苗、增肥、早期排种”的增产经验的基础上，在全县的乡乡社社普遍的开展了全民性的大规模技术训练工作，将在春节后全部完成第一期训练。今后将紧紧结合生产需要每年开展二、三次技术训练，把农民的技术知识提高到更好的水平。
    下放干部，加强基层领导
    为加强领导，充实基层，乡委书记、乡长均由县委的部长、县人委的科局长去担任。全县一百七十个农业社，已派下一百四十名区委书记、区长、委员级干部，担任了主任、支部书记的领导工作。农民对这批从土改就和他们在一起生产、斗争的老战友，表示了热烈的欢迎；下去的干部也都表示了极大的决心和写下了保证书。如组织部副部长王勇说：坚决为党和人民的大业，在农村干到白头到老。下乡之后，一定和农民同甘共苦，提前实现四十条。所以他们下去之后，群众的积极性更高了，干部的事业心更强了。加上工作方法和作风的转变改进，各项工作都立竿见影的迅速收效了。
    现在，我们县的冬季生产高潮正在深入发展之中，但我们绝不骄傲，还要不断的同右倾保守思想和因循守旧的观点进行不懈的斗争，学习全国各地的先进经验，在党的领导下，彻底发动群众，有始至终的把握住增产的关键，用忘我的劳动和愚公移山的革命毅力，同时间赛跑，放下架子，打掉官气，和农民一道的工作、劳动，克服前进中的一切困难。我们坚信：在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，信心百倍的去努力工作，为我们祖国的伟大建设事业贡献出我们一切力量。
