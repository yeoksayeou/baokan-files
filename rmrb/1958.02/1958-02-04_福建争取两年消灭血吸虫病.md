Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 3rd: "Wipe it out this year, finish it off next year, and completely eliminate schistosomiasis within two years." This is the slogan for action of the Party and government leading organs and the people in schistosomiasis-endemic areas of Fujian Province.

At present, all localities are vigorously wiping out schistosomiasis, with the health departments taking the lead and relevant departments fully cooperating. The water conservancy departments are combining water conservancy construction with snail eradication; the agricultural departments are assisting in good manure management; youth, women, teachers, and others are strengthening propaganda and mobilization work. In Fuqing County, where schistosomiasis is severe, and on other coastal water conservancy construction sites, the area of snail eradication has reached more than 154,000 square meters in the past half month. Medical workers and old professors from the Fujian Province's epidemic prevention institutions, major hospitals, and Fujian Medical College have also joined the battle. They have formed specialized groups to strengthen the research on drugs for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. The deputy director of the Office of the Nine-Person Leading Group for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and three experts from other provinces have also come to Fujian to assist in the work.

Schistosomiasis is relatively prevalent in ten coastal counties in Fujian Province, such as Fuqing and Yunxiao. There are about 60,000 patients, and about 300,000 people are threatened.
