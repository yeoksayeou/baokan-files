Liu Zhigang, a representative, reported on the patriotic health campaign in Jiangxi Province, focusing on the elimination of the four pests. He said: In recent years, the movement of sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the "four pests" has achieved brilliant results. Some acute and severe infectious diseases that endanger human life and health have been basically controlled or eliminated. The blitz movement of sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the four pests, which has been launched since last winter, is surging and sweeping across the province. Now the question is no longer whether the four pests can be eliminated, but how long it will take to eliminate them.

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I will briefly talk about the patriotic health campaign in Jiangxi Province, centered on sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the "four pests," and I ask the representatives to point out any errors.

Actively carrying out the movement of sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the "four pests" is an important measure to improve people's living conditions, enhance people's physical fitness, and support agricultural production increase. It is also an important part of socialist economic construction and cultural construction. In recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of party and government at all levels and the active efforts of the broad masses, our province's movement of sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the "four pests" has achieved brilliant results. The people's level of health knowledge has been continuously improved, and significant results have been achieved in eliminating rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes. Some acute and severe infectious diseases that endanger people's lives and health have been basically controlled or eliminated. The development of the movement has played a significant role in improving people's health, supporting agricultural production.

In 1952, the people of Jiangxi actively responded to the call of the Party and the People's Government and launched a vigorous patriotic health campaign against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism throughout the province. This movement not only thoroughly shattered the bacteriological warfare of American imperialists, but also greatly advanced the health work of the whole province.

After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) in 1956, our province launched a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. According to statistics at the end of 1957, the province already had forty-nine "four-free" streets, towns, villages, and communes, one hundred and seventeen fly-free and sixty-four mosquito-free villages and communes, two rat-free streets and villages, and had basically eliminated schistosomiasis in twenty-five townships in five counties, including Yujiang, Wuyuan, Shangyou, Fengxin, and Fuliang. I think this is truly an unprecedented miracle. We have also taken active prevention and control measures for various acute and severe infectious diseases. In addition to vigorously organizing health workers to carry out treatment responsibly and promptly, we have resolutely implemented the principle of "prevention first," thereby greatly reducing or basically eliminating various acute and severe infectious diseases in our province. The incidence of general diseases has also decreased significantly. According to statistics from the Provincial Health Department based on epidemic reports from the whole province, the incidence of malaria in the province in 1957 decreased by 61 percent compared with 1955, and the incidence of diphtheria decreased by 27.7 percent.

Since the second half of last year, the broad masses of people in our province, after the anti-Rightist struggle and the socialist education movement, and the study of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, have unprecedentedly improved their political awareness and have great revolutionary enthusiasm. In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year and realize a great leap forward in agricultural production, a massive and magnificent winter production movement is taking shape in the vast rural areas, focusing on building farmland water conservancy, accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, planting trees and forests, and strengthening field management of winter crops. Sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the four pests is an important part of the winter production movement. Our province plans to accumulate 5 billion dan of fertilizer this year (an average of 120 dan per mu). In addition to natural fertilizer, green manure, chemical fertilizer, and commercial fertilizer, a considerable part of it relies on farmyard manure. While doing a good job in managing human and animal excrement, we must also do a good job in sanitary fertilizer accumulation. The province's 4 million farmers and 2 million urban residents are expected to accumulate 720 million dan of fertilizer. Sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the four pests play an important role in agricultural production, and can also cultivate the good habit of everyone paying attention to hygiene and every family loving cleanliness. It is also a great initiative in terms of preventing diseases, improving people's living conditions, enhancing people's physical fitness, and revitalizing national spirit.

Since last winter, the blitz movement of sanitary fertilizer accumulation and the elimination of the four pests launched in our province has been surging and sweeping across the province. The depth of the movement and the greatness of its scale are unprecedented. In the movement, responsible comrades of party and government at all levels have set an example by personally participating in cleaning streets and removing garbage. This exemplary action has effectively promoted and encouraged the broad masses. In rural areas, regular cleaning is stipulated, and human and animal excrement are promptly stored in cellars in separate areas and points, covered and sealed to allow fermentation, in order to eliminate parasite eggs. Many rural areas have achieved that people have toilets, pigs have pens, cattle have sheds, manure has cellars, cellars have covers, ash has sheds, and ditches are free of dirty water, and are clean everywhere. In cities, unified organization and leadership, division of responsibilities by area, responsibility at different levels, and everyone participating are used to clean up sewers, sludge ditches, toilets, garbage dumps, streets and alleys, indoors and outdoors. For example, in Nanchang City, more than 260,000 people participated in this movement on Sunday, January 12, accounting for more than half of the city's total population. On this day alone, more than 4,200 tons of garbage were removed; Jiujiang City also removed nearly 60,000 dan of garbage and sludge in one Sunday; Ganzhou City caught 120,000 rats and killed more than 60,000 sparrows; in Jinjiang Town, Yujiang County, residents of the entire town accumulated 1.01 million dan of sanitary fertilizer in forty-eight days, an average of 301 dan per person, caught 53,000 rats, and killed 23,000 sparrows. They plan to accumulate 5 dan of sanitary fertilizer, catch 5 rats, and kill 20 sparrows per person before the Spring Festival. The broad rural areas and towns in the province have achieved great results in this movement. According to statistics at the end of January, the province had accumulated 200 million dan of sanitary fertilizer, dug 12,000 jin of pupae, caught more than 1.5 million rats, killed more than 1.6 million sparrows, blocked more than 23,000 rat holes, destroyed 24,090 sparrow nests, filled more than 15,000 low-lying areas, dredged more than 1.39 million meters of ditches, built more than 1,400 new toilets, and demolished 11,071 toilets that did not meet hygiene conditions. The sanitary appearance of the province has been completely renewed.

Although great achievements have been made, we are by no means satisfied, and we are continuing to lead and organize the broad masses of the province to carry out this movement more broadly and deeply. The question of whether it is possible to eliminate the four pests has been proven by facts to no longer exist, and now it is a question of how long it will take. Our province's original plan was to achieve "four-free" in five to seven years. Now, according to the spirit of "whipping the horse and accelerating, comprehensively leaping forward, ten-year plan, striving to complete in five years," the masses are full of enthusiasm and have expressed their willingness to eliminate the four pests within one or two years. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have revised the plan based on the situation in various places and decided to concentrate efforts for three years, wrap up for two years, and eliminate the four pests in about five years. The people of the whole province have the confidence and determination to realize this plan, and I personally believe that it can certainly be done.

    三年突击　二年扫尾　五年消灭四害
    刘之纲代表报告江西省以消灭四害为中心的爱国卫生运动情况。他说：几年来，卫生积肥和消灭“四害”运动，已经取得了辉煌的成绩。一些危害人生命和身体健康的急性、烈性传染病，基本上得到控制或消灭。从去冬起掀起的卫生积肥、消灭四害的突击性运动正在汹涌澎湃、席卷全省地开展着。现在已经不是能不能消灭四害的问题，而是消灭四害的时间长短问题。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的报告。现在我简单地谈谈江西省以卫生积肥、消灭“四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动，并请代表们指正。
    积极开展卫生积肥和消灭“四害”运动，是改善人民生活条件、增强人民体质和支援农业增产的重要措施，也是进行社会主义经济建设与文化建设的一项重要内容。几年来，我省卫生积肥和消灭“四害”运动，由于各级党政的正确领导和广大群众的积极努力，已经取得了辉煌的成绩。人民群众的卫生知识水平不断提高，消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子等工作已取得了显著的成效，一些危害人民生命和身体健康的急性、烈性传染病，基本上得到控制或消灭。运动的发展，对于提高人民身体健康水平，支援农业生产，起了很大作用。
    一九五二年江西人民积极地响应了党和人民政府的号召，在全省范围内掀起了轰轰烈烈反对美帝国主义细菌战的爱国卫生运动。这一运动不但彻底地粉碎了美帝国主义者的细菌战，而且使全省卫生工作也大大的向前推进了一步。
    一九五六年全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，我省又开展了以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，到一九五七年底统计，全省已有四十九个“四无”的街、镇、村、社，一百一十七个无蝇、六十四个无蚊的村、社，二个无鼠的街、村，并在余江、婺源、上犹、奉新、浮梁等五个县二十五个乡，基本上消灭了血吸虫病。我认为这真是一个史无前例的奇迹。对于各种急性烈性传染病，我们也采取了积极防治措施，除大力组织卫生工作人员认真负责地及时进行治疗外，并坚决贯彻了“预防为主”的方针，从而使各种急性、烈性传染病，在我省已大为减少或基本上消灭。一般疾病的发病率也有显著的降低。据省卫生厅根据全省疫情报告的统计，全省一九五七年疟疾的发病率比一九五五年降低了百分之六十一，喉痧发病率降低了百分之二十七点七。
    我省广大人民自去年下半年以来，经过反右派斗争和社会主义教育运动、全国农业发展纲要修正草案的学习，政治觉悟空前提高，革命的干劲很大。为了争取今年农业大丰收，实现农业生产大跃进，已在广大农村中形成了声势浩大、规模壮阔的兴修农田水利，积肥造肥，植树造林，加强冬季作物田间管理为主要内容的冬季生产运动高潮。卫生积肥消灭四害，就是冬季生产运动中的一个重要组成部分。我省今年计划积肥五十亿担（每亩平均一百二十担），除自然肥料、绿肥、化肥和商品肥料以外，还有相当一部分是靠农家肥料，我们在作好人畜粪便管理的同时，还要作好卫生积肥。全省四百万农户、二百万城镇人口，预计可以积肥七亿二千万担。卫生积肥、消除四害对于农业生产起着重要作用，而且能够养成人人讲卫生，家家爱清洁的优良习惯。对于预防疾病，改善人民生活条件，增强人民体质，振奋民族精神等方面也是一个伟大创举。
    我省自去冬起，掀起的卫生积肥、消灭四害的突击性运动，正在汹涌澎湃、席卷全省的开展着。运动的深入，规模的伟大，是史无前例的。在运动中，各级党、政的负责同志，都以身作则，亲自参加打扫街道、清除垃圾等工作。这一模范行动，有效地推动和鼓舞了广大群众。在农村，规定了定期打扫，分片分点把人畜粪便及时储存在窖内，加盖密闭，使之发酵，以消灭寄生虫卵，许多农村已做到人有厕、猪有圈、牛有栏、粪有窖、窖有盖、灰有棚、沟渠无脏水，到处清洁。在城市以统一组织、统一领导，分片包干、分层负责、人人动手，把下水道、污泥沟、厕所、垃圾堆、大街小巷、室内室外，都打扫得干干净净。如南昌市，利用一月十二日的星期天，全市有二十六万多人参加这个运动，占全市总人口的半数以上。仅在这一天，清除垃圾达四千二百多吨；九江市也在一个星期天清除垃圾、污泥近六万担；赣州市捕鼠十二万只，打麻雀六万多只；余江县锦江镇全镇居民在四十八天内，卫生积肥达一百零一万担，平均每人三百零一担，捕鼠五万三千只，打麻雀二万三千只，他们计划在春节前每人还要卫生积肥五担，捕鼠五只、打麻雀二十只。全省广大农村和城镇在这个运动中已获得很大的成绩。据一月底的统计全省卫生积肥已达二亿担，挖蛹一万二千斤，捕鼠一百五十多万只，打麻雀一百六十多万只，堵塞鼠洞二万三千多处，捣毁雀窠二万四千零九十处，填平洼地一万五千多处，疏通沟渠一百三十九万多公尺，新建厕所一千四百多个，拆除不合卫生条件的厕所一万一千零七十一个。使全省卫生面貌，焕然一新。
    虽然取得了很大成绩，但也绝不满足，我们还在继续领导与组织全省广大群众，把这个运动进行得更广更深。怀疑能不能消灭四害的问题，从事实证明，是已经不存在了，现在是时间长短的问题。我省原来的规划是在五至七年作到“四无”，现在根据“快马加鞭，全面跃进，十年规划，争取五年完成”的精神，群众的劲头很足，纷纷表示在一、二年内就可把四害消灭干净。省委、省人委根据各地情况，已经修订了规划，决定三年突击二年扫尾，五年左右消灭四害。全省人民是有信心有决心实现这个规划的，我个人更相信是一定能够办到的。
