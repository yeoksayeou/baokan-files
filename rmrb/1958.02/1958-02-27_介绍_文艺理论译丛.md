Introducing the "Literary Theory Translation Series"
　　An Qi

　　The second issue of "Literary Theory Translation Series" was published not long ago.

　　The majority of this issue is dedicated to introducing the great French realist writer Balzac. It includes four articles and fourteen letters written by Balzac himself, as well as commentaries and memoirs on Balzac by important French writers such as Hugo, Zola, and critics Taine and Brunetière.

　　The preface to Balzac's "The Human Comedy" is an important article. In 1842, Balzac compiled his previously written and planned novels since 1829 into a collection titled "The Human Comedy." This preface was written at that time. In the preface, he outlined the reasons for writing "The Human Comedy." He said: "French society will be the historian, and I can only be its secretary. To compile a list of vices and virtues, to gather the main facts of passions, to delineate characters, to select major social events, to combine the characteristics of several characters with similar traits into typical figures, in this way I might write the history that many historians have forgotten to write, that is, the history of manners." At that time, although this vast history was not finally completed, the secretary of 19th-century French society looked at his already scaled and grand work, and his heart was filled with pride and confidently looking forward to the future. This confidence is revealed in the "Preface."

　　The importance of the "Preface" lies in the fact that it is a programmatic summary of the author's rich creative life. It touches upon some important issues in Balzac's realist creation methods: the role of social environment in shaping and forming character, the complexity of character, the typification of character images, and the authenticity of detailed descriptions. Balzac's opinions in these areas demonstrate his profound realist spirit. In the "Preface," Balzac also mentioned that writers should become teachers of mankind, and writers should have certain insights in morality and politics. Regarding himself, he said these words: "I write under the illumination of two eternal truths, which are religion and monarchy." It should be said that there is a contradiction between Balzac's political views and his realist creative ideas. What is embodied in his great work "The Human Comedy" is the author's "profound understanding of social relations" (Marx's words), his criticism of 19th-century bourgeois society in France, and his boundless confidence in the future of mankind. This is precisely due to the author's influence by the French Enlightenment and contemporary progressive thought. The progressiveness of "The Human Comedy" lies in this, and not in the author's own proclaimed idea of using the "eternal truths" of Catholicism and monarchy to save this sinful society. Through this "Preface," it is not difficult to see the contradictions and complexities in Balzac's thought.

　　"Letter to Mr. Paullette Cassity, Editor of 'Weekly Report'" can be regarded as an important supplement to the "Preface." It contains explanations of the main characters in the two novels "Old Goriot" and "The Lily of the Valley," and puts forward his own opinions on the contrast between the good and evil of the characters.

　　The second issue also includes Balzac's two short articles commenting on Hugo's works and fourteen letters from 1820 to 1850. In the short article on Hugo's drama "Hernani," he criticized the irrationality of the characters and plots in Hugo's drama, and demanded that literary works should also have a high degree of authenticity in the depiction of details. This article is a criticism of a Romantic writer by a Realist writer; it shows the fundamental differences in creative ideas between the two writers belonging to different literary schools. This article is helpful for understanding Balzac's creative ideas, and it is also beneficial for understanding the characteristics of Hugo's Romantic drama. Balzac's fourteen letters also help readers understand certain aspects of the writer's life. From these letters, one can know the hard and arduous literary apprenticeship life that Balzac lived in his early years, and the embarrassing situation of being debt-ridden even after becoming famous. Some of the letters also involve the author's certain works and political views.

　　In the articles commenting on Balzac, Hugo's "Balzac's Funeral Oration," Taine's "Balzac's Theory," and Zola's section "About Balzac" are all worth reading. Hugo's "Funeral Oration" made a general comment on Balzac. He listed Balzac in the "powerful ranks of revolutionary writers" because he believed that "Balzac rushed straight to his destination and seized the melee of modern society." This short speech in front of the tomb represents the high evaluation of Balzac by the general democrats in France at that time, and it is full of respect and praise for this cultural giant, calling him "the first rank among the greatest figures," saying that the remarkable work "The Human Comedy" is "a majestic monument of granite layers."

　　Taine was one of the first critics to conduct a careful study of Balzac. He was the first to compare Balzac with Shakespeare. His famous essay translated in this issue is one of his masterpieces. In order to write it, the author collected a wealth of information about Balzac's works and life. Although due to the positivist point of view, he could not profoundly and correctly determine Balzac's ideological tendencies and the basic nature of his creation, this article discusses some of the characteristics and advantages of Balzac's creative ideas, methods, and styles, which were novel insights at the time; today, we still feel that the analysis is detailed and it is still valuable for reference.

　　In his early writing about Balzac, Zola had very insightful views on the contradictions between the creative significance of this great realist writer and his political views. He believes that "although Balzac was a royalist and a Catholic, he spent his entire life paving the way for the republic, for the free society and free faith of the future." He pointed out that such a conclusion is revealed in all of Balzac's works: the brilliant republic is destined to come. Moreover, he said that Balzac gave the vigorous power of the French nation to the great people. Zola's arguments are obviously largely consistent with Engels' remarks on Balzac in his letter to Harkness in April 1888.

　　Balzac's works were introduced to our country a long time ago. After liberation, readers became increasingly interested in this rich and colorful writer. Balzac is a great writer, and a correct understanding of his complex thoughts and outstanding creative activities is helpful to explain and elaborate on some major issues in literary theory; and in fact, we have seen more than once the use of Balzac to distort some issues of principle. Therefore, it is the task of the literary translation and research circles to introduce him to our readers more and to study him more comprehensively and deeply. The articles about Balzac translated in this issue of "Literary Theory Translation Series" provide us with good reference materials for understanding and studying Balzac.

　　In addition, this issue also includes the second half of Marx's "A Critical Examination of Eugène Sue's Novel 'The Mysteries of Paris'." This long paper is one of the most valuable documents in Marxist literary theory and deserves our special attention. The first half of it was published in the first issue of "Literary Theory Translation Series" published last year. The first issue mainly introduced the papers of Marx, Engels, and early Marxists, and translated several articles that are of high value and significance to us today. In these articles, the authors elaborated on the basic Marxist literary viewpoints in conjunction with comments on specific works, writers, or literary schools. After reading it, one can have a deeper understanding and understanding of some important literary theory issues. Moreover, these important papers are directly aimed at the reactionary bourgeois or petty-bourgeois literary trends in the society at that time, and are closely related to the political and ideological struggles at that time. These articles are strongly combative, historically accurate, and incisive in analysis, providing us with brilliant examples on the front line of literary and ideological struggle. It is worth introducing to readers again.

　　For a long time, in our country's literary research and creative practice, there have been disputes over certain important theoretical issues, and these issues remain to be resolved. Therefore, a deeper study of the classic works of Marxist literary theory, the literary theory of early Marxists is imminent. At the same time, it is also completely necessary to further understand and study the classical aesthetics and literary theory, as well as the works of writers of various eras and schools on literary principles and creative techniques. "Literary Theory Translation Series" was created to introduce the above content. From 1958, it will be changed from an irregular publication to a quarterly. This year, in conjunction with the realism issues that have caused controversy in the literary world, it will introduce the works of writers and critics from different eras on realism in installments. The first issue of this year, which will meet readers in March, will focus on aesthetic issues and introduce the main papers or important chapters in monographs by the most famous aestheticians such as Diderot, Kant, and Hegel.

    介绍“文艺理论译丛”
    安期
    “文艺理论译丛”在不久前出版了第二期。
    这期绝大部分篇幅都是介绍法国伟大的现实主义作家巴尔扎克的。有他自己写的文章四篇和书信十四封，有当时法国重要的作家雨果，左拉，批评家泰纳、布吕及耶尔对巴尔扎克的评论和回忆录等。
    第一篇巴尔扎克的“人间喜剧”前言，是一篇重要的文章。巴尔扎克在1842年把他从1829年以后已写的和拟写的有关小说编为一个总集，定名为“人间喜剧”。这篇前言就是在这时写出来的。在前言中，他概述了为什么要写“人间喜剧”的缘由。他说：“法国社会将要作为历史家，我只能当他的书记。编制恶习和德行的清单、搜集情欲的主要事实、刻划性格、选择社会上主要事件、结合几个性质相同的性格的特点揉成典型人物，这样我也许可以写出许多历史家忘记了写的那部历史，就是说风俗史”。当时，这一部浩繁的历史虽未最后完成，然而，这位十九世纪法国社会的书记看到自己的已具规模的宏大的作品，心中是怀着骄傲、充满信心地瞻望着将来的。这种信心流露在“前言”中。
      “前言”的重要性在于，它是作者的丰富创作生活的一篇纲领性的总结。它涉及到了巴尔扎克的现实主义创作方法中的一些重要的问题：社会环境对于人物性格的塑造和形成的作用、人物性格的复杂性、人物形象的典型化、以及细节描写的真实性等。巴尔扎克在这些方面的意见表现了他深刻的现实主义精神。在“前言”中，巴尔扎克也谈到了作家应该成为人类的教师，作家在道德和政治上应有一定的见解。关于他自己，他说了这样的话：“我在两种永恒真理照耀下写作，那是宗教和君主政体。”应该说，巴尔扎克的政治主张和他的现实主义创作思想之间是有矛盾的。体现在他伟大著作“人间喜剧”中的，是作者“对社会关系的深刻理解”（马克思语），对法国十九世纪资产阶级社会的批判，以及对人类前途无限的信心。这正是作者受法国启蒙思想与同时代进步思想的影响所致。“人间喜剧”的进步性在于此，而不是作者本人所标榜的他用天主教和君主政体的“永恒真理”来挽救这罪恶社会的那种思想。通过这篇“前言”，不难看出巴尔扎克思想中的矛盾和复杂的地方。
    “致‘星期报’编辑保利特·卡斯狄叶先生书”可看作是“前言”的一个重要的补充。其中有对于“高老头”和“幽谷百合”两小说中主要人物的说明，并对人物的善恶对比提出了自己的意见。
    第二期还有巴尔扎克评论雨果作品的两篇短文和从1820年到1850年之间的书信十四封。在论雨果的戏剧“欧那尼”的短文中，他批评了雨果的戏剧中的人物性格和情节中不合情理的地方。要求文学作品在细节的描写上也应具有高度的真实性。这篇文章是一个现实主义作家对浪漫主义作家的批评；它显示了这两个作家所属的不同的文学流派在创作思想上的根本差别。这篇文章对于理解巴尔扎克的创作思想是有益处的，对于认识雨果的浪漫主义戏剧特点也不是无所裨益的。巴尔扎克的书信十四封也有助于读者了解这位作家生活中的某些方面。从这些书信中，能够知道巴尔扎克早期所过的辛勤刻苦的文学学徒生活，成名以后仍债务缠身的困窘境地。其中也有的书信涉及到了作者的某些作品和政治见解。
    在评论巴尔扎克的文章中，雨果的“巴尔扎克葬词”、泰纳的“巴尔扎克论”以及左拉的一节文字“关于巴尔扎克”都是值得阅读的。雨果的“葬词”对巴尔扎克作了概括的评论。他把巴尔扎克列入“革命作家的强大行列”，因为，他认为“巴尔扎克笔直奔目的地，抓住了现代社会肉搏。”这篇短短的墓前演说，代表了当时法国一般民主主义者对巴尔扎克的崇高评价，其中洋溢着对这位文化巨人的敬爱和赞美之情，把他称为“最伟大的人物中间”的“第一等的一个”，说“人间喜剧”这部了不起的作品，是“金岗岩层的雄伟的纪念碑。”
    泰纳是最初的一个对巴尔扎克进行慎重研究的批评家，是他首先把巴尔扎克与莎士比亚相提并论。本期译出的他这篇著名的论文是他的力作之一。为了写它，作者收集了丰富的有关巴尔扎克的作品和生活的资料。虽然由于实证主义的观点，使他不能深刻地正确地论定巴尔扎克的思想倾向和创作的基本性质，但这篇文章所论巴尔扎克的创作思想上、方法上和风格上的一些特色和优点，在当时是有新颖的见地的；在今天，我们读它仍感到分析详尽，不失为有参考价值的文字。
    左拉早年所写的关于巴尔扎克的这一小节文字中，对于这位伟大的现实主义作家的创作意义和他政治见解之间的矛盾，有十分精到的见解。他认为：“虽然巴尔扎克是保王党和天主教徒，他却花了毕生精力为共和国、为未来的自由社会和自由信仰开路。”他指出，在巴尔扎克全部作品中流露出这样的结论：光辉灿烂的共和国是注定要来的。而且说，巴尔扎克把法兰西民族里生气蓬勃的力量给予了伟大的人民。左拉的这些论点显然和恩格斯于1888年4月致哈克纳斯信中论及巴尔扎克的话大致相合。
    巴尔扎克的作品介绍到我国来，已经是很早以前的事了。解放后，读者对这位丰富多采的作家兴趣日益浓厚。巴尔扎克是一个伟大的作家，对于他复杂的思想和杰出的创作活动的正确认识和理解，有助于说明与阐述文学理论中一些重大的问题；而事实上，我们已经不止一次看到利用巴尔扎克曲解一些原则性问题的情况。因此，向我国读者更多地介绍他，更全面而深刻地研究他，是文学翻译界和研究界的任务。“文艺理论译丛”本期所译出这些有关巴尔扎克的文章，给我们认识与研究巴尔扎克提供了很好的参考材料。
    除此以外，本期还有马克思的“对于欧仁·苏小说‘巴黎的秘密’的一个批判的考察”一文的下半篇。这长篇论文是马克思主义文艺理论中最宝贵的文献之一，值得我们特别注意。它的上半篇已发表在去年出版的“文艺理论译丛”第一期上。第一期是以介绍马克思、恩格斯和初期马克思主义者的论文为主，译出了好几篇对我们今天具有很高价值和重要意义的文章。在这些文章中，作者结合对具体的作品、作家或文艺流派的评论，阐述了马克思主义的基本文艺观点。读了以后，能对一些重要的文艺理论问题有更深刻的体会和认识。而且，这些重要的论文都是直接针对当时社会上反动的资产阶级或小资产阶级的文艺思潮，和当时的政治思想斗争有紧密的联系。这些文章战斗性强，史料详确，分析精辟，为我们在文艺思想斗争的战线上提供了光辉的范例。值得我们再一次向读者介绍。
    很久以来，在我国文学研究和创作实践中，已经发生了对某些重要理论问题的争论，这些问题有待解决。因此，更深入地研究马克思主义文艺理论的经典著作，早期马克思主义者的文艺理论就是迫不急待的了。同时，也完全有必要对古典的美学和文艺理论以及各时代各流派的作家有关文艺原理和创作技巧的论著进一步的了解和研究。“文艺理论译丛”就是为了介绍上述内容而产生的。从1958年起，由不定期刊改为季刊。本年度，它将结合文艺界发生争论的现实主义问题，分期介绍不同时代的作家和批评家关于现实主义的论著。即将在今年3月份与读者见面的本年度第一期，将以美学问题为中心，介绍最著名的美学家如狄德罗、康德和黑格尔的主要论文或专著中的重要章节。
