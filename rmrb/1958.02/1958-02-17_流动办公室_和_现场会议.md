    “Mobile Offices” and “On-Site Meetings”
    Deng Tuo
    How exactly should the working methods of leading organs be improved? This is a problem that cadres at all levels are urgently seeking to solve. To solve this problem, working comrades in many regions have already accumulated many good experiences. I believe that the working methods of "mobile offices" and "on-site meetings" adopted by the CPC Hong'an County Committee of Hubei Province are good methods worthy of attention.
    On the day I visited the Hong'an County Committee, Cheng Peng, the First Secretary of the County Committee, had just returned from Tongbai Township, forty miles away, and had gone to his own experimental field. I met this energetic thirty-six-year-old County Party Secretary next to his experimental field. Another secretary, Wang Yulin, was busy leading the large-scale airing of views by primary and secondary school teachers. Another secretary, Zhang Jingtian, had gone to the mountainous area. In addition to these three secretaries, the County Committee originally had four standing committee members and twenty members. Among them, only four people spent more time in the office due to the particularity of their work and their health conditions, while the rest were scattered in the townships and cooperatives, living and working with the masses. The entire staff of the Hong'an County Committee office was seventy-six people, and usually two-thirds of them went to the countryside, and sometimes only nine people were left in the office, while the rest went to the countryside.
    The work of the County Committee was specifically divided according to three principles. These three principles are: first, to ensure the balanced development of regional work; second, to combine departmental work with central work; and third, to adapt to the needs of comprehensive production development. According to these principles, the standing committee members and other members of the County Committee were assigned leadership responsibilities for certain districts and townships, certain fronts and departments, and certain industries and types of production. For example, Cheng Peng, the First Secretary of the County Committee, and Ma Youcai, the County Head, were responsible for leading the overall work and were responsible for leading grain production, especially the research and improvement of rice and wheat production. Secretary Zhang Jingtian and Deputy County Head Su Shiying were responsible for leading the work in mountainous areas, and were also responsible for leading the management of fruits and other forestry products, as well as local specialties.
    Under this division of labor, the leading cadres of the County Committee certainly cannot sit in the office to work, but must be active below on a regular basis. Thus, the so-called "mobile office" was born. This office is just a borrowed name, and in essence it is an uncompromisingly small and capable leading group. They are not "working" according to any written or unwritten rigid rules; they are guiding work in a lively and creative way.
    The Hong'an County Committee began to adopt this working method in 1957. Cheng Peng often took a deputy director of the County Committee office and two researchers, each carrying a pair of "guǎnzi" woven from bamboo by local farmers, filled with luggage and hoes, and also carrying a telephone and one mile of wire, which formed a mobile office. Zhang Jingtian also moved around in the mountainous area with a similar mobile office. They participated in production and led production wherever they went; they solved problems wherever they found them; they contacted all parties wherever they went. The masses highly praised this leadership work method.
    For example, as far as I know, at dusk on January 21, the mobile office led by Comrade Cheng Peng arrived in Xinzhai Township and found that some cadres and the masses were not grasping the manure accumulation campaign tightly enough; at dawn on the 22nd, as soon as he got up, he took the other three comrades from the mobile office to the cowshed to remove manure, and in less than three hours, they produced three hundred dan of manure; after breakfast, they went to the fields to pick up grain stubble. This motivated the township and cooperative cadres and members to intensify their efforts to accumulate manure. That afternoon, they went to Gaoshan Township to inspect production, discovered some new situations and problems, and after investigation and research, put forward new opinions and called the County Committee office, saying: Some cadres are still not good at leading production. Although they are with the masses and working very hard, the benefits to the work are not great. They have not understood the needs of the masses and helped the masses solve key problems in production through participating in production. The situation in some agricultural cooperatives in Gaoshan Township shows that there are problems in the organization of labor. Many production teams do not seize the time to arrange the next day's labor after finishing work every day, but arrange it temporarily on the next day, resulting in irrational use of labor, making the masses feel that they have no place to use their strength or that it is wasted. Therefore, Comrade Cheng Peng suggested that all cadres in the county should be called upon to lead production more specifically. The method is to participate in production during the day and help the production team arrange the next day's production at night, so as to better organize and use the labor of the members. This instruction quickly spread throughout the county. On the 23rd, when he arrived in Tongbai Township, Comrade Cheng Peng asked many questions. The township cadres did not know the situation because they had not gone down, and could not answer; they reviewed their lack of in-depth work and immediately went to the fields to participate in production. The masses said: Secretary Cheng is doing a good job, driving all the township cadres into the fields. These facts show that the practice of mobile offices is good, and it is one of the new leadership methods that have emerged in the upsurge of rectification and the upsurge of production.
    Then, will this leadership method have problems, for example, will it weaken the role of the County Committee's collective leadership? It can be affirmed that this will not happen. Because the County Committee not only has regular meetings that can comprehensively check and summarize work and stipulate new work guidelines and tasks; but also the County Committee can often convene on-site meetings of cadres and activists at the county, district, township, cooperative, and team levels according to actual needs, to give play to the collective role on a larger scale and discuss and solve various specific problems in a timely manner. It should be seen that on-site meetings are also a new type of leadership method.
    The Hong'an County Committee frequently convenes on-site meetings. The people who participate in such meetings include the relevant responsible comrades of the County Committee, the personnel of the competent departments of the County People's Committee, the district and township cadres, and the heads of several agricultural cooperatives and production teams. What is put forward at the on-site meetings is often the freshest, most specific, and most vivid issues that everyone is urgently concerned about, so the discussions are also very lively and energetic, and the results are relatively satisfactory.
    For example, on January 24, after inspecting production in Tongbai Township and other places, Comrade Cheng Peng decided to convene an on-site meeting in the Er'cheng District, attended by more than 30 relevant cadres from the county, district, and township levels. This on-site meeting, based on the specific situation of the Er'cheng District, discussed how to further thoroughly change the work style of cadres, mobilize the masses more deeply, and lead the upsurge of production more specifically. At the meeting, good work styles of some cadres were specifically commended, good experiences in leading the masses were summarized, such as mobilizing members to report their attendance, rationally stipulating labor quotas, etc., and specific tasks such as continuing to build water conservancy projects, increasing manure accumulation, and improving soil were deployed. The cadres who participated in the meeting believed that the meeting was held quickly and solved problems practically. Some township cadres returned home in the middle of the night and went to work early the next morning, with increasing enthusiasm. Isn't this enough to illustrate the great role of on-site meetings in promoting the high tide?
    It is precisely because of the frequently convened on-site meetings that many situations and problems have usually been repeatedly analyzed and studied, and the opinions of cadres and the masses at all levels have been fully concentrated, which has prepared for the County Committee's regularly held meetings for checking and summarizing work, and created more favorable conditions for the County Committee's collective leadership.

    “流动办公室”和“现场会议”
    邓拓
    领导机关的工作方法究竟应该怎样改进呢？这是目前各级干部迫切要求解决的问题。为了解决这个问题，许多地区的工作同志已经积累了不少好的经验。中共湖北省红安县委采取的“流动办公室”和“现场会议”的工作方法，我认为是值得重视的好方法。
    在我访问红安县委会的那一天，县委第一书记程鹏同志刚从四十里外的桐柏乡回来，又到他自己的试验田里去了。我在他的试验田旁边见到了这位精神焕发的三十六岁的县委书记。另一位书记王玉林同志正忙着领导中小学教员的大鸣大放。还有一位书记张景田同志到山区去了。除去这三位书记以外，县委会本来还有四个常委和二十个委员。其中只有四个人因为工作的特殊性和身体有病在机关里的时间较多一些，其余的都分散到乡里和社里，同群众一起生活，一起劳动。红安县委机关全体工作人员是七十六人，平时有三分之二下乡，有时全机关只留九个人，其余都下乡去。
    县委的工作按照三个原则做了具体的分工。这三个原则是：第一、要保证地区工作发展的平衡，第二、要使部门工作与中心工作相结合，第三、要适应生产全面发展的需要。按照这些原则，县委的常委和其他委员都分别担负了一定的区和乡、一定的战线和部门、一定的行业和生产种类的领导责任。比如县委第一书记程鹏同志和县长马友才同志负责领导全面的工作，并且负责关于粮食生产的领导，特别是研究和改进水稻和麦子的生产。书记张景田同志和副县长苏士英同志负责领导山区工作，同时也负责领导果木和其他林业以及土特产的经营。
    在这种分工之下，县委的领导干部当然就不能坐在机关里办公，而必须经常在下面活动。于是，所谓“流动办公室”就产生了。这个办公室只是借用的一个名义，它在实质上倒是一个不折不扣的短小精干的领导小组。他们并不是在按照着什么一种成文的或不成文的死规矩来“办公”；他们是生动活泼地富有创造性地在指导工作。
    红安县委在1957年开始采用这种工作方法。程鹏同志经常带着县委办公室的一个副主任和两个研究员，每人挑起一对当地农民用竹子编成的“筦子”，里边装了行李和锄头，另外还背一个电话机和一里路的电线，这就形成了一个流动办公室。张景田同志也带着同样的一个流动办公室在山区活动。他们走到那里就在那里参加生产，领导生产；他们在那里发现了问题就在那里解决；他们到那里就在那里同各方面联系。群众对这种领导工作方法十分称赞。
    举例来说，据我所知，1月21日黄昏，程鹏同志带领的流动办公室到了新寨乡，发现有的干部和群众对于积肥运动抓得不够紧；22日拂晓，他一起床就带了流动办公室的另外三个同志到牛栏里去除粪，不到三小时，弄出三百担粪；早饭后又到地里去拣谷蔸。这样就带动了乡社干部和社员加劲地积肥。当天下午，他们又到高山乡去检查生产，发现了一些新的情况和问题，经过调查研究，提出了新的意见，并且向县委机关打电话，内容是说：现在有一些干部还不善于领导生产，自己虽然同群众在一起，干得很累，可是对工作的益处不大，没有通过参加生产，了解群众的要求，帮助群众解决生产中的关键问题。高山乡有一些农业社的情况表明，目前在劳动力的组织方面有问题。许多生产队在每天收工以后，没有抓紧安排第二天的劳动，到第二天临时安排，以致劳动力的使用有不合理现象，使群众感到自己有力无处用或者是浪费了。因此，程鹏同志提议，号召全县干部，要更具体地领导生产，办法是白天参加生产，夜间帮助生产队安排第二天的生产，以便更好地组织和使用社员的劳动力。这个指示很快地就传播到全县去了。23日到达桐柏乡，程鹏同志问了许多问题。乡干部因为没有下去，不了解情况，不能回答；他们检讨自己工作不深入，马上就都到地里去参加生产。群众说：程书记做得好，把乡干部全都赶下田里了。这些事实说明，流动办公室的做法是好的，它是在整改高潮和生产高潮中出现的新的领导方法之一。
    那末，这种领导方法会不会发生毛病，比如说，会不会削弱县委集体领导的作用呢？可以肯定地回答，这是不会的。因为县委会不但还有定期的会议，能够全面地检查和总结工作，规定新的工作方针和任务；而且县委还常常能够根据实际需要，召开县、区、乡、社、队几级干部和积极分子的现场会议，在更大的范围内发挥集体的作用，及时地讨论和解决各种具体问题。应该看到，现场会议也是新的领导方法的一种。
    红安县委经常召开现场会议。参加这种会议的人有县委的有关负责同志、县人民委员会的主管部门人员、区乡干部以及某几个农业社和生产队的负责人。在现场会议上提出的往往是最新鲜的具体生动的为大家所迫切关心的问题，所以讨论起来也非常热烈、带劲，结果也比较使人满意。
    比如，1月24日，程鹏同志检查了桐柏乡等地的生产以后，决定在二程区召开现场会议，参加的有县、区、乡三级有关的干部三十多人。这个现场会议，根据二程区的具体情况，讨论了如何进一步彻底转变干部作风，更深入地发动群众，更具体地领导生产高潮的问题。会上具体地表扬了一些干部的好作风，总结了领导群众的好经验，如发动社员自报出勤、合理地规定劳动定额等等，并且布置了继续兴修水利、增加积肥、改良土壤等具体任务。参加会议的干部认为，这个会议开得又快，解决问题又切实。有的乡干部半夜回到家里，第二天清早就上工，干劲越来越大。这难道还不够说明现场会议推动高潮的巨大作用吗？
    正因为有了经常召开的现场会议，许多情况和问题平时就已反复地经过了分析和研究，并且充分地集中了各级干部和群众的意见，这就为县委定期举行的检查和总结工作的会议做了准备工作，为县委的集体领导创造了更有利的条件。
