　　Cadres Sent to Lower Levels and Peasants Stage Opera Together

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The peasants of Donghongmiao Village, Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Jinan City, had tried to form their own theater troupe several times in the past, but without success. After the cadres were sent to lower levels, the village established an amateur theater troupe with the active participation of the cadres. Twenty-eight young people participate in this troupe. After work, the young men and women in the village are happy to participate in the activities.

　　The cadres sent to lower levels and the peasants worked together to rush to rehearse many programs such as the opera "Returning After Graduation" to celebrate the Spring Festival.
