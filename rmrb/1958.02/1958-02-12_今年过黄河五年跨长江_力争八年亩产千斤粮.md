This Year Cross the Yellow River, In Five Years Cross the Yangtze River.
Strive for 1,000 Jin Per Mu in Eight Years
Representatives Li Shunda and Shen Jilan reported the Jinxing Cooperative's enthusiasm: "Realize water conservancy ahead of schedule, march forward early and late; see the stars at both ends, fight with lanterns at night; don't mind the cold when the snow is three feet deep, don't stop fighting when the ground is frozen three feet."
When we came to the meeting, the cooperative members all said that this conference must solve the problem of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. After listening to the reports and speeches, it fits our wishes. We fully agree with the various reports of the conference. Now, we will report to the conference the past production situation of the Jinxing Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, and the plan for realizing the Great Leap Forward in the future.

The members are now debating not whether they can achieve a thousand-jin cooperative, but whether to achieve it in ten years or eight years.

Our cooperative's rectification movement is coming to an end. Now, a major debate on production planning is underway. After the promulgation of the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program in 1956, our cooperative formulated a twelve-year long-term plan. This plan required the unit yield of grain to reach 500 jin per mu by 1962 and 700 jin per mu by 1967. At that time, we thought this indicator was very high. Now it seems that this indicator is not high but low. In 1957, the unit yield of grain in our cooperative had already reached 488 jin per mu. Therefore, in the debate, the members unanimously believed that the past plan was too conservative. Now, the issue debated by the members is not whether they can achieve a thousand-jin cooperative, but whether to achieve it in ten years or eight years. Most of us believe that it is entirely possible to cross the Yellow River this year, cross the Yangtze River in five years, and become a thousand-jin cooperative in eight years.

The poor mountain沟, lacking all five elements, and suffering from severe disasters for years, still increased production year after year, with the output nearly doubling and a half in five years, proving the unparalleled superiority of cooperation.

Why do we say it is entirely possible? Just look at the achievements our cooperative has made during the first five-year plan period, and you will know. Our place has been known as a poor mountain沟 lacking the "five elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth" since ancient times. It is really as the saying goes: "Floods, hail, and typhoons occur every year, and nine out of ten years are often unproductive." Before the war, the average grain yield per mu for poor and lower-middle peasants was only 70 jin, and the grain yield per mu for wealthy middle peasants was no more than 200 jin. However, our cooperative has increased production every year in the past five years. Especially in 1956 and 1957, due to the advantages of advanced cooperation, the historical face of low grain production has undergone great changes. The cooperative has a total of 271 households, with 1,670 mu of cultivated land. Unit yield of grain: 200 jin in 1952, 305 jin in 1953, 324 jin in 1954, 366 jin in 1955, 401 jin in 1956, and 488 jin in 1957. It has nearly doubled and a half in five years, with an average annual increase of 28.8% (an average annual increase of 17.7%). It should be known that we did not achieve annual production increases under favorable weather conditions, but had to wage a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters every year. Especially in 1956, the continuous hail, flood, and wind disasters were the worst in a century. Last year's drought and frost disasters were also rare since liberation. However, it was precisely in these two years that our cooperative's grain production made a leap forward. This not only shows that as long as the advantages of cooperation are brought into play, natural disasters can be overcome; but it also shows that the lower the production area, the greater the potential. As many of our members said: "Contracted output is limited, but increased output is boundless."

Experience in increasing production: Do a good job in water conservancy and soil conservation, increase fertilizer application, expand high-yield crops, practice intensive cultivation, and implement a experimental plot system.

Based on our past years of experience in increasing production, the most important thing to achieve a Great Leap Forward is to do a good job in water conservancy and soil conservation, increase fertilizer application, expand high-yield crops, and practice intensive cultivation.
I. Water Conservancy. Speaking of water, it is really more expensive than oil in our area. Before 1952, not to mention that there was not a single mu of irrigated land, even the drinking water for people had to be carried from distant mountain沟s. After the initial cooperation was realized in 1952, we started to work on water conservancy. In the four years up to 1955, the flood canals that were built could irrigate a total of 160 mu. Since the transformation to advanced cooperative in the autumn of 1955, 275 large and small canals have been built in two years, expanding flood irrigation by 800 mu, which is four times the increase in the past four years. By last summer, flood irrigation had accounted for 60% of the cultivated land area. These irrigated lands can generally be irrigated once to four times a year. By turning dry land into flood-irrigated land, as long as it can be irrigated four times a year, and combined with other conditions, the grain yield per mu may reach more than 1,000 jin. However, the water source for flood irrigation is not reliably guaranteed. The cooperative has 500 mu of cultivated land on both sides of the riverbed, 670 mu of cultivated land on the hillside, and another 500 mu of cultivated land on the high mountains. Based on these three different situations, we plan to adopt measures appropriate to local conditions within the next three years, such as building small reservoirs, digging storage ponds, digging springs, building转山渠, drilling dry wells, and using mechanical high-ground irrigation, to turn all cultivated land into clear water irrigation or clear-flood dual irrigation.
II. Soil and Water Conservation. The area of soil erosion that needs to be controlled in our cooperative is 19,000 mu. From 1952 to 1957, a total of 15,200 mu have been controlled, accounting for 80% of the area that should be controlled. Among them, 7,200 mu of barren hills were afforested; 6,700 mu of barren slopes were treated by digging fish-scale pits for planting trees or cultivating pastures interplanted with trees; 200 mu of山沟s were treated by building谷坊and闸拦水坝; 300 mu of river滩 were treated by building dams for land reclamation; and 800 mu of cultivated land were renovated by building terraces, cutting inside and padding outside, repairing edges and embankments, and raising high and padding low. More than 60% of the above projects have been completed in the past two years. The remaining 20% of the area that needs to be controlled can be completed in another year and a half. After the entire completion, all 18,000 mu of mountain tops and slopes in the cooperative will be covered. On the mountains and in the沟s, there will be 500,000 walnut trees, 5,000 pepper trees, 10,000 apple trees, 5,000 pear trees, 500 grape vines, and even more mountain peaches, mountain apricots, etc. At that time, the old appearance of bare mountains and ridges will truly become the beautiful appearance of Huaguo Mountain and Water Curtain Cave.
III. Applying more fertilizer is even more important in our area because the soil is thin. In the past few years, the amount of fertilizer applied by our cooperative has increased year by year, and the quality has been greatly improved. By 1957, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu had increased from 5,600 jin in 1952 to 12,000 jin. Among them, refined fertilizers such as human and animal manure, straw fertilizer, and green manure accounted for more than 80%. In order to achieve a thousand-jin cooperative, the amount of farm manure required per mu must be increased to more than 20,000 jin.
IV. Expanding high-yield crops is the main way for our cooperative to increase production. In 1957, the total area of 玉茭 in the cooperative expanded to 754 mu, accounting for 47% of the total cultivated land, with an average yield of 633 jin per mu. Among them, 310 mu reached more than 800 jin; and 41 mu reached 1,000 to 1,300 jin. Among the 170 mu of mountain potatoes planted by the cooperative, 50 mu achieved large-scale high yields, with an average of 800 jin of raw grain per mu. In the future, we will plant 90% of the cultivated land with high-yield crops.
V. Intensive cultivation is an important magic weapon for our cooperative to increase production. In the past few years, the amount of labor used in cultivation has increased year by year. In 1957, all cultivated land was plowed three times and harrowed four times; deep plowing reached six to eight inches; weeding was done four times. Before the large autumn crops head, all of them must be earthed up. The benefit of doing this is: storing water, conserving soil, and preventing wind from blowing them down. Such cultivation is beyond the reach of any wealthy middle peasant in the past. Before the war, wealthy middle peasants invested a maximum of 13 labor days per mu. Last year, we used 20 labor days per mu; plus the labor invested in basic land construction, it reached 26 labor days per mu. In the future, we plan to increase the labor invested per mu to 30 labor days.
VI. The implementation of the experimental plot system has played a significant role in increasing production in our cooperative. Since 1953, the cooperative has established experimental plots. In the past, it was called a small farm and seed retention land. In the past two years, nearly 20 grain crop varieties have been tested. For example: Wutai mountain potatoes, Bima No. 1 and Bima No. 4 wheat, as well as Qi Tou Huang, Lu Mi Qing, Mu Ji Zui and other excellent grain varieties. Production techniques such as close planting, intercropping, corn artificial pollination, and corn灌心 have also been tested. Now, the cooperative has a technical team, and each team has technicians and experimental plots, and technical night schools have also been opened, forming a technical promotion network. No matter what crop variety or what new cultivation technology, it is first tested, and then gradually promoted after success. Taking close planting and intercropping as an example, we were not used to it here in the past. After testing, it can indeed increase production, and now it is widely promoted. In the future, we must strengthen the experimental work as the main method for our cooperative cadres to lead production.

We believe that in the next eight years, as long as we follow the above six experiences and plans, and at the same time humbly learn all the good experiences of other places, we will definitely be able to achieve or even achieve the goal of a thousand-jin cooperative ahead of schedule. By then, the total income of the cooperative's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries will reach more than one million yuan, an increase of nine times compared with the present. Of the total income, we will take out 50% as the cooperative's public accumulation and to support national construction; the average net income of members will reach 374 yuan per person, an increase of five times compared with 1957. The average public property of the entire cooperative will reach 10,000 yuan per household. With so much property and income, our cooperative will not only be as solid as reinforced concrete, but its contribution to the country will become greater and greater.

Measures were drawn up to achieve the plan. All male and female full and semi-labor forces in the cooperative, without a single idle person, work in shifts day and night. Currently, the water conservancy and soil conservation plan has completed two-thirds of the annual plan, and fertilizer accumulation has completed 90% of the annual plan.

In order to realize this plan, we must follow the slogans put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, look at three years in ten years, look at the first year in three years, and look at the first winter in the first year. First of all, we must make a good start this year and increase the grain yield per mu to 600 jin. The main measures we are taking to achieve this goal are: (1) To build 600 large and small reservoirs and storage ponds, drill 500 dry wells, build 500 large and small canals, and dig 8 water springs. Completing these projects can expand irrigated land by 320 mu and change flood irrigation to clear water irrigation by 480 mu. In this way, the irrigated land of our cooperative will account for 80% of the cultivated land (30% of which is clear water irrigation), basically realizing water conservancy. (2) To build 120 谷坊s and拦水坝s, build 300 zhang of large stone dams, renovate 600 mu of terraced fields, and dig fish-scale pits for planting trees on 1,500 mu of barren mountains. Completing these projects can control a total of 2,350 mu of soil erosion area, plus the original controlled area, it can control 92% of the soil erosion area. (3) Increase fertilizer application. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu will increase from 12,000 jin last year to 15,000 jin. In order to increase pig manure, the number of pigs raised will increase from 550 last year to 1,200, that is, an average of one pig per person. (4) Expand high-yield crops. The planting area of 玉茭 and mountain potatoes will increase from 900 mu last year to 1,200 mu, reaching 72% of the cultivated land area. And we will expand the area of 玉茭 with double-plant close planting. (5) Intensive cultivation. The amount of labor used for cultivation per mu will increase from 20 last year to 25, and special attention should be paid to processing in remote and low-yield areas.

In order to realize this year's Great Leap Forward plan, in the past three months, the members have been extremely enthusiastic about water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and fertilizer accumulation! In this short period of time, the entire cooperative has already done more than 30,000 labor days, accounting for 35% of the total labor days done last year. This number shows that not only is there not a single idle person among all the male and female full and semi-labor forces in the cooperative, but also in order to realize water conservancy ahead of schedule, they work in shifts day and night. As the members said, "Realize water conservancy ahead of schedule, march forward early and late; see the stars at both ends, fight with lanterns at night; don't mind the cold when the snow is three feet deep, don't stop fighting when the ground is frozen three feet." Just look at the following example to know how high the members' enthusiasm is! From the autumn harvest last year to December, we and the surrounding brother cooperatives, using the spring water upstream, jointly built an underground cylinder pipe water channel, more than 20 li long, passing through nine natural villages and reaching directly to Pingshun County. This water channel not only generally solved the problem of human and animal water use in these villages and the county, but also irrigated more than 150 mu of land for our cooperative alone. When the water was released and the celebration meeting was held last December, the masses jumped with joy. They said:
"Building the spring water channel can quench the thirst of ten thousand years. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, things that could not be imagined and could not be done in the past have now been done. This is really a great happy event!" After achieving this victory, the enthusiasm of the masses has become greater and greater. Up to now, water conservancy and soil and water conservation have completed two-thirds of the annual plan, and fertilizer accumulation has completed 90% of the annual plan. Our Great Leap Forward plan must be realized, and it will surely be realized.

Dear representatives: Let us, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, launch a Great Leap Forward competition on various fronts!

    今年过黄河五年跨长江
    力争八年亩产千斤粮
    李顺达、申纪兰代表报告金星社社员的干劲：“提前实现水利化，起早搭黑大进军；两头见星星，黑夜打马灯；雪下三尺不嫌冷，地冻三尺不收兵。”
    我们来开会的时候，社员们都说这次大会一定是要解决工农业大跃进的问题。听了报告和发言，正合我们的心愿。我们完全同意大会的各项报告。现在，我们把山西省平顺县西沟乡金星社过去的生产情况和今后实现大跃进的计划，向大会汇报一下。
    现在社员辩论的不是能不能实现千斤社的问题，而是用十年还是用八年实现的问题。
    我们社整风运动快要结束了。现在，正在进行生产规划大辩论。一九五六年，全国农业发展纲要四十条公布后，我们社就制订过一个十二年的远景规划。这个规划，要求粮食单位亩产量，到一九六二年达到五百斤，一九六七年达到七百斤。当时，我们认为这个指标就很高了。现在看来，这个指标不是高而是低了。一九五七年，我们社的粮食单位亩产量，就已经达到四百八十八斤。所以，社员们在辩论中，一致认为过去的规划太保守了。现在，社员们辩论的问题，不是能不能实现千斤社的问题，而是用十年、还是用八年来实现的问题。我们多数人认为，今年过黄河，五年跨长江，八年成为千斤社，是完全可能的。
    五行俱缺的穷山沟，又连年遭受特大灾害，仍然连年增产，五年产量翻了将近一翻半，证明合作化的无比优越性。
    为什么说完全可能呢？只要看一看我们社在第一个五年计划期间所取得的成绩，就可以知道了。我们那里，自古以来就被人称为“金、木、水、火、土”五行俱缺的穷山沟。真是像俗话所说：“洪涝风雹年年有，十年九旱常不收。”在战前，贫农、下中农每亩粮食平均产量只有七十斤，富裕中农每亩粮食产量也不过二百多斤。但是，我们社在过去的五年中，年年都增产。特别是一九五六、一九五七两年，由于发挥了高级合作化的优越性，粮食低产的历史面貌，已经发生了大变化。全社二百七十一户，共有耕地一千六百七十亩。粮食单位亩产量：一九五二年是二百斤，一九五三年是三百零五斤，一九五四年是三百二十四斤，一九五五年是三百六十六斤，一九五六年是四百零一斤，一九五七年是四百八十八斤。五年翻了将近一翻半，每年平均增长百分之二十八点八（每年平均递增百分之十七点七）。要知道，我们并不是在风调雨顺的情况下得到年年增产的，而是每年都要和各种各样的自然灾害进行顽强的斗争。特别是一九五六年，连续受到的雹灾、洪灾、风灾，是百年不遇的大灾。去年的旱灾和冻灾，也是解放以来所少有的。但是，正是在这两年中，我们社的粮食产量取得了跃进。这不但说明了，只要发挥合作化的优越性，就可以战胜自然灾害；而且也说明了，越是低产区，潜力就越大。正如我们许多社员所说：“包产有限，增产无边”。
    增产的经验：搞好水利、水土保持，增施肥料，扩大高产作物，实行精耕细作，实行试验田制度。
    根据我们过去几年增产的经验，实现大跃进，最主要的是要搞好水利、水土保持，增施肥料，扩大高产作物，实行精耕细作。
    一、兴修水利。说到水，在我们那里真是比油还贵。一九五二年以前，不用说没有一亩水地，就连人吃的水，还要到很远的山沟里去担。从一九五二年实现了初级合作化之后，开始动手兴修水利，到一九五五年的四年间，兴修的洪水渠共可浇地一百六十亩。一九五五年秋转为高级合作社以来，两年就修成大小渠道二百七十五条，共扩大洪水浇地八百亩，比过去四年发展的水浇地增加了四倍。到去年夏季，洪水浇地已经占到耕地面积的百分之六十。这些水浇地，一般每年能浇一次到四次。由旱地变成洪水浇地，只要一年能浇四次，配合其它条件，每亩粮食产量就有可能达到一千斤以上。但用洪水浇地水源没有可靠的保证。全社有五百亩耕地在河床两岸，有六百七十亩耕地在半山腰，另有五百亩耕地在高山上。根据这三种不同的情况，我们计划在今后三年内，因地制宜，采取修小型水库、挖蓄水池、挖泉、修转山渠、打旱井、用机械高地灌溉等等办法，把全部耕地变为清水浇地或者清洪两浇地。
    二、水土保持。我们社需要进行治理的水土流失面积一万九千亩，从一九五二年到一九五七年的六年中，已经治理的面积共为一万五千二百亩，占应治理面积的百分之八十。其中，荒山造林七千二百亩；用挖鱼鳞坑植树或者用培育牧草间作林木治理荒坡六千七百亩；用筑谷坊、闸拦水坝，治理山沟二百亩；用打坝淤地治理河滩三百亩；用修梯田、里切外垫、修边垒岸、起高垫低等办法，整修耕地八百亩。以上这些工程百分之六十以上是近两年完成的。其余需要治理的百分之二十的面积，再有一年半就可以全部完成。在全部完成后，全社一万八千多亩山头、山坡上，就都有了覆盖。在山上，在沟里，就将有核桃树五十万株，花椒树五千株，苹果树一万株，梨树五千株，葡萄五百株，山桃、山杏等就更多了。那时，原来童山秃岭的旧面貌，就真正变成花果山、水帘洞的美丽面貌了。
    三、增施肥料，在我们那里因为土薄就更加重要。这几年，我们社施肥的数量年年增加，质量大大提高。到一九五七年，每亩施肥的数量，已经由一九五二年的五千六百斤增加到一万二千斤。其中，人畜便粪、秸肥、绿肥等精肥，占到百分之八十以上。为了实现千斤社，每亩需要的农家肥料要提高到二万斤以上。
    四、扩大高产作物，是我们社增产的主要门路。一九五七年，全社的玉茭扩大到七百五十四亩，占总耕地的百分之四十七，每亩平均产量达到六百三十三斤。其中，有三百一十亩达到八百斤以上；有四十一亩达到一千至一千三百斤。全社种的一百七十多亩山药蛋，有五十亩获得大面积丰产，平均每亩折原粮八百斤。今后，我们要把百分之九十的耕地种成高产作物。
    五、精耕细作，是我们社增产的一个重要法宝。这几年，耕作用工量年年增加。一九五七年，全部耕地做到耕三耙四；深耕达到六寸至八寸；锄耧四次。大秋作物在吐穗前，要全部培土。这样做的好处是：蓄水、保土、风刮不倒。像这样的耕作，过去任何富裕中农都比不上。在战前，富裕中农每亩投工最多十三个。去年，我们每亩用工是二十个；再加上土地基本建设投工，每亩达到二十六个。今后，计划每亩投工要增加到三十个。
    六、实行试验田制度，对于我们社的增产起了很大作用。从一九五三年起，社里就建立了试验田。过去，叫他是小农场和留种地。最近两年来，先后试验了近二十个粮食作物品种。比如：五台山药蛋、碧玛一号和碧玛四号小麦，还有齐头黄、露米青、母鸡咀等优良谷种。还试验了密植、间作、玉米人工授粉、玉米灌心等生产技术。现在，社内有技术股，队队有技术员和试验田，还开办了技术夜校，形成了一个技术推广网。无论什么作物品种、什么新的耕作技术，都是先经过试验，成功后才逐步推广。拿密植和间作来说，过去我们这里不习惯，经过试验，确实能增产，现在就普遍推广了。今后，我们更要加强试验工作，作为我们社干部领导生产的主要方法。
    我们相信，在今后八年内，只要按照以上六条经验和规划去做，同时虚心学习外地的一切好经验，就一定能够实现甚至提前实现千斤社的奋斗目标。到那时，全社农林牧副的总收入将达到一百多万元，比现在增加九倍。在总收入中，我们要拿出百分之五十作为社内的公共积累和支援国家建设；社员的纯收入每人平均将达到三百七十四元，比一九五七年增加五倍。全社所有的公共财产，每户将平均达到一万元。有这样多的财产和收入，我们的社不但像钢骨水泥一样坚固，而且对国家的贡献将越来越大。
    订出实现规划的措施，全社男女全半劳动力，没有一个闲人，白天黑夜轮班干，目前，水利和水土保持计划已经完成全年计划的三分之二，积肥完成全年计划的百分之九十。
    为了实现这个规划，我们必须按照党中央和毛主席提出的口号，十年看三年，三年看头年，头年看头冬，首先在今年打响头一炮，把粮食亩产量提高到六百斤。我们实现这个目标的主要措施是：（一）要修大小水库和蓄水池六百个，打旱井五百眼，修大小渠道五百条，挖水泉八处。完成这些工程，共可扩大水浇地三百二十亩，改洪水浇地为清水浇地四百八十亩。这样，我们社的水浇地就占到耕地的百分之八十（清水浇地占百分之三十），基本上实现水利化。（二）修谷坊、拦水坝一百二十座，修大石坝三百丈，整修梯田六百亩，在荒山上刨鱼鳞坑植树一千五百亩。完成这些工程，共可控制水土流失面积二千三百五十亩，加上原有治理面积，就可以控制水土流失面积的百分之九十二。（三）增施肥料。每亩平均施肥量，由去年的一万二千斤增加到一万五千斤。为了增加猪粪，养猪要由去年的五百五十口增加到一千二百口，即每人平均养猪一口。（四）扩大高产作物。玉茭、山药蛋种植面积，要由去年的九百亩增加到一千二百亩，达到耕地面积的百分之七十二。并且要扩大玉茭双株密植的面积。（五）精耕细作。每亩耕作用工量，要由去年的二十个增加到二十五个，特别要注意在远地和低产地上加工。
    为了实现今年的跃进计划，在最近三个月来，社员们搞水利、水土保持和积肥的劲头真是大极啦！在这短短的时间内，全社已经做到劳动日三万多个，占到去年全年所做劳动日的百分之三十五。这个数字说明，全社所有男女全半劳动力，不但没有一个闲人，而且为着提前实现水利化，白天黑夜轮班干。正像社员们所说的那样：“提前实现水利化，起早搭黑大进军；两头见星星，黑夜打马灯；雪下三尺不嫌冷，地冻三尺不收兵。”只要看一看下面这个例子，就可知道社员们的情绪是多么高涨！去年秋收后到十二月间，我们和周围兄弟社，利用上游的泉水，联合修成了一条地下缸管水道，长二十多里，通过九个自然村，直达平顺县城。这条水道不但普遍解决了这些村庄和县城的人畜用水问题，而且单我们社就可浇地一百五十多亩。当去年十二月修成放水开庆祝大会的时候，群众都高兴得跳起来了。他们说：
  “修了泉水道，能解万年渴。在共产党和毛主席领导下，过去不能想、不能办的事情，现在办到了。这真是天大的喜事！”在取得这个胜利后，群众劲头越来越大。到目前为止，水利和水土保持已经完成了全年计划的三分之二，积肥已经完成了全年计划的百分之九十。我们的跃进计划一定要实现，也一定能实现。
    各位代表：让我们在党中央和毛主席的英明领导之下，在各个不同的战线上，展开大跃进的竞赛吧！
