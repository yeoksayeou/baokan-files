The ideological food for the reader will be fully supplied
(Dispatch from our newspaper) The salespersons of the New China Bookstore's Beijing branch, including the branch stores and book stalls, are engaged in a socialist competition during the lead-up to the Spring Festival. To facilitate the readers, they have widely proposed in the challenge letters to work ten hours a day, stick to a single shift (no shift rotation), implement a "big rest day" (one day off every two weeks), and not rest during Spring Festival and other holidays. At the same time, they proposed that the speed of commodity circulation should be increased by 50% to 100% compared with last year, to ensure the readers' timely needs. The internal staff of the bookstore also voluntarily provides support to strengthen the work of the branch stores during the Spring Festival holiday.

In order to improve service attitude and service quality, each sales point has proposed different effort targets according to its characteristics. For example, all the salespersons of the seven branch stores in Dongdan District proposed to proactively recommend books to readers 140,000 times throughout the year, doubling the number from last year; ensuring "three diligences" (diligently promoting books to readers, diligently fetching books for readers, diligently delivering books to readers' doors), "three familiarities" (familiar with the needs of readers, familiar with the content of books, familiar with the current situation), "two goods" (good management and good hygiene), and "one attention" (pay attention to courtesy); and fixing the bookshelves managed by each salesperson, mobilizing readers to supervise.

In the suburbs, such as the Fengtai District branch store, the salespersons, in order to do a good job in the distribution work for agricultural cooperatives, also put forward the resounding slogan of "no missing any team (production team of agricultural cooperatives), and every cooperative seeing results" (that is, recommending and supplying books and periodicals needed for the great leap forward in agricultural production).

Providing Medical Care for the People as Usual During the Spring Festival
(Dispatch from our newspaper) Recently, eighteen units, including the Chongqing First People's Hospital, jointly submitted a guarantee to the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, guaranteeing that they would break with convention during the Spring Festival. In this guarantee, the medical workers enthusiastically pointed out: At present, workers and farmers across the country are actively responding to the call of the Party, not stopping work at all during the Spring Festival to welcome the great leap forward in production. Medical workers should also serve production and make greater efforts for the nationwide leap forward. Therefore, they decided to not only open clinics as usual during the Spring Festival, but also strive to carry out the battle to eliminate the four pests, striving to become a four-free unit before the Spring Festival.

This is How They Spend the Spring Festival
(Dispatch from our newspaper) The winter vacation life of the students of Tangshan Railway College is diverse. Many students responded to the call of the school's Communist Youth League Committee not to go home for the Spring Festival, and some students who had already bought tickets to go home also returned their tickets.

In order to implement the policy of work-study program, they have established various production groups, such as hairdressing and sewing groups. Some students who have mastered hairdressing skills have expressed their willingness to teach other students.

The second-year students of this college living in the branch campus will move to the main campus during the winter vacation. Originally, they planned to hire a group of temporary workers to help with the move. Because the students responded to the call for running schools diligently and thriftily, they proposed that all moving tasks be borne by the students themselves. (Cheng Jiaxiang)

New Year's Eve Cleaning
(Dispatch from our newspaper) Many students of the Renmin University of China have decided not to go home for the winter vacation this year. Some students who had already bought train tickets immediately returned them after reading the People's Daily editorial "Breaking with Convention for the Spring Festival." All students staying at school will spend a large part of their half-month vacation doing sanitation work to eliminate the four pests and participating in labor in the countryside. During the Spring Festival, students staying at school will participate in voluntary labor in the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in the eastern suburbs and the Xishan Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs, building water conservancy projects and digging canals together with the commune members, spending the Spring Festival on the construction site. Cleaning and sanitation work during the holiday will continue as usual, and preparations are being made for a school-wide cleaning on Lunar New Year's Eve. Currently, students throughout the school have caught more than 11,000 rats and sparrows, ranking at the forefront of various universities in Beijing. The students are full of enthusiasm, and put forward the slogan: "Another Great Leap Forward during the Winter Vacation!" (Wang Pei)
