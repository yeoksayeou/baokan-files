Dad Says I'm Dumb
Zhìguó

Auntie asked me if last night's play was good. Oh dear, it's really awkward to think about, how should I put it?

Yesterday Dad said he would take me to see a play in the evening. As soon as I finished breakfast, I kept asking: What time is it? Hoping it would get dark quickly.

Dad has a habit of always dawdling when doing things, which is really annoying. After dinner, I finally nagged Dad into putting on his coat and leaving the house. But on the way, he was either flipping through magazines at the newsstand or looking at the windows of the general store. I kept pulling him along, almost tearing his sleeve off.

"Hey! What a long line," Dad said, looking at his watch. "That's terrible, we won't be able to squeeze on even after waiting for three more buses."

"It's all your fault, always so slow..." I almost cried. You tell me, how could I not be anxious?

I don't know how, but Dad silently picked me up and ran to the front of the line in a few strides. I thought: What is he doing! I'm already a first-grade student, only little kids need to be carried! I only heard Dad say: "Comrade, excuse me, the child has a stomach ache on the way and is clamoring to go home, please let us cut in line!" This confused me. I touched my stomach, when did I have a stomach ache? I wanted to ask Dad, but he didn't even look at me.

The bus hadn't come yet, and Dad was probably tired of holding me, so he put me down and started smoking.

Two uncles next to us were talking about Erlang Shen. I knew this play, I had seen it before. So I said to the uncle: Erlang Shen also has a celestial dog! One uncle said I was really good, and the other uncle asked me if my stomach still hurt?

"My stomach doesn't hurt at all!" I said, "Dad is taking me to see a play now." I pulled Dad, "Dad, how many more minutes?"

I don't know why, but everyone laughed. Dad seemed to be awakened by the laughter. I thought, what are you laughing at, what's so funny about seeing a play. I looked at Dad, huh, why is Dad's face red? Is it because of the north wind? Or is it because of the neon lights across the street? Why are everyone staring at Dad again? I really can't figure it out.

When we got on the bus, Dad whispered in my ear: "So dumb!" What's going on, I don't understand.

We arrived at the theater. As usual, Dad swayed his head and hummed along with the singing on the stage. Some uncles around us, I don't know why, were holding their stomachs and laughing. Oh, I remembered, why were people laughing at the bus stop? Dad lied, yes, he lied. I secretly looked to see if anyone was still looking at us, touched my face, and didn't know why it was so hot. I couldn't see anything.

I was thinking: Didn't Auntie say: Good children should be honest? Dad has also told me this, but, Dad he...

    爸爸说我笨
    志国
    阿姨问我，昨晚的戏好看不？啊呀，想起来可真别扭，怎么说好呢？
    昨天爸爸说晚上带我去看戏，刚吃完早饭，我就老问：几点啦？盼着天快黑。
    爸爸有个习惯，干什么总是磨磨蹭蹭的，真急人。吃过晚饭，好不容易才吵得爸爸穿上大衣，出了家门。可是，一路上他不是翻翻书报摊上的杂志，就是看看杂货店的橱窗，我尽拉着他走，差点儿把他的袖管也拉下来了。
    “嘿！好长的队，”爸爸看了看手表说，“真糟糕，再等三辆汽车也挤不上。”
    “都是你，老是那么慢慢的……”我差一点急得要哭起来了，你说，我怎能不急呢？
    不知道怎么的，爸爸不声不响地把我抱起来，三脚两步就跑到队伍的前头。我想：这是干吗呀！我可是一年级小学生了，小弟弟才要抱哩！只听见爸爸说：“同志，对不起，小孩半路上闹肚痛，吵着要回家，让我们在前面排一下吧！”这一下可把我迷糊了。我摸摸肚子，我几时闹肚痛呀？我想问爸爸，可他连瞧也不瞧我一眼。
    车还不来，爸爸大概也抱累了，把我放下，抽起烟来。
    旁边两位叔叔在谈二郎神。我知道，这戏我看过。我就和叔叔说：二郎神还有天狗哩！一个叔叔说我真乖，一个叔叔问我肚子还痛不痛？
    “我的肚子一点也不痛！”我说，“现在爸爸带我看戏去。”我拉了爸爸一下，“爸爸，还有几分钟呀？”
    不知怎么的，大伙儿都笑了。爸爸似乎才被笑声惊醒。我想，你们笑什么呀，说看戏有啥好笑的。我看看爸爸，咦，爸爸脸为什么红了呢？北风吹的？还是对面马路上霓虹灯照的缘故呢？怎么大伙儿又尽瞧着爸爸呢？我真想不过来。
    上了车，爸爸在我耳旁说了声：“真笨！”怎么回事呀，我不懂。
    到了剧场。和平常一样，爸爸摆着脑袋，低低地跟着台上唱。周围一些叔叔，不知道为什么捧着肚子直笑。喔，我想起来了，为什么车站上的人要笑呢？爸爸说谎了，对，说谎了。我偷偷地看了看，有没有人还瞧着我们，摸摸脸，不知道为什么直发烫。什么也看不进去。
    我在想：阿姨不是说过：好孩子要诚实吗？爸爸也对我这么讲过呀，可是，爸爸他……。
