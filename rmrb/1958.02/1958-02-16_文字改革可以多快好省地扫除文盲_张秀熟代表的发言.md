    Language Reform Can Eliminate Illiteracy Quickly, Economically and Effectively
    Speech by Delegate Zhang Xiushou
    I fully agree with the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I would like to express some opinions on language reform work and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

    Gradually Approaching and Unifying the People's Pronunciation
    With Full Possibilities and Superior Material Foundation

    Language and writing are important media and tools for people in a certain society to express their thoughts, exchange ideas, and thereby jointly promote the material and cultural life of society. It is an objective product of social and historical development, and it must develop with the social and historical development. Today, our country has developed to an unprecedented level of unity in politics, economy, and culture. The people of the whole country are united under the leadership of the Party and the government, and are working together for the common goal of building socialism. The phenomena of pronunciation differences and language barriers left over by history are no longer adapted to the development of the entire society, and bring certain difficulties in political, economic, and cultural life. Therefore, the people urgently need a common language to better jointly promote the material and cultural life of society and accelerate the building of a socialist society. This is determined by the objective laws of social development. At the same time, under the unprecedented conditions of political, economic, and cultural unity in our country, gradually achieving the approximation and unification of the people's language is not just an ideal and requirement, but has full possibilities and an unprecedentedly superior material foundation. In terms of language itself, as a common language, the Northern dialect used by more than 70% of the nearly 600 million Chinese-speaking people is a readily available foundation. Therefore, promoting Mandarin Chinese, which takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound and the Northern dialect as the basic dialect, as the common language of the Han nationality, and even as the common language of all ethnic groups in the country, and treating this work as an important political task at present, I think it is very correct. Facts have proved that although we have achieved certain results in this area in the past few years, objectively speaking, we are still lagging behind the needs of the people.

    Although Simplified Chinese Characters Are a "Quick Fix," They Solve the Urgent Need - The Simplified Characters Are Not Enough, Not Good Enough
    Secondly, the shortcomings of Chinese characters themselves, which express the Chinese language, such as being difficult to recognize, difficult to read, difficult to write, and difficult to remember, have long been lamented by our ancestors, and are particularly prominent today, and are not adapted to the objective needs of social development. It is a simple and easy, although "quick fix," but an urgent solution, and a great thing to legalize simplified characters that have been popular among the people for a long time and have become customary, and to create new simplified characters based on certain principles on the basis of the original Chinese characters. The facts of the past two years have proved that the simplification of Chinese characters is unanimously welcomed by the people and has achieved certain effects in popularizing culture. The current problem is that the number of simplified characters is not enough and not adapted to the needs, and a few characters are not simplified well enough. Therefore, the report proposes: "We must continue to actively promote the gradual simplification of all relatively commonly used characters with more strokes"; "Concentrate the wisdom of the masses, sort it out, and incorporate it into unified norms." I think it is very appropriate. I also welcome the National Language Reform Committee to "take an active attitude" in this work.

    Easy to Learn, Remember, and Master - This Is Our Country's Most Complete Phonetic Scheme
    In order to promote Mandarin Chinese and gradually enable the people of the whole country—first of all, the Han nationality—to master a common language, in order to solve the contradiction between the form and sound of Chinese characters, which are difficult to recognize and difficult to read, the state must formulate a set of universally used phonetic alphabets as a tool to unify pronunciation and help phonetic notation. The draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme passed and promulgated by the State Council on November 1, 1957, and submitted to this congress for discussion and approval, inherits the tradition of "direct sound" and "fanqie" for more than 2,000 years in our country, up to the phonetic alphabet, and is a summary of the experience of the Chinese people in creating phonetic schemes for 60 years. Its greatest and most fundamental advantage is that it adopts phonetic Latin letters. As a phonetic symbol, the current phonetic alphabet has some shortcomings, which have been overcome in the draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. (Reference: Zhang Shilu, "Phonetic Alphabet Is Much Superior to Phonetic Alphabet"—"Language Reform," January 1958, page 43) It can not only unify pronunciation, annotate Chinese characters, and help promote Mandarin Chinese; it also facilitates the recording of minority languages ​​and serves as a common basis for designing minority languages' writing systems. In addition, it has certain indispensable functions for promoting international cultural exchanges, unifying scientific and technological translations, and meeting the needs of transportation, postal and telecommunications, industry and commerce, and publishing departments in certain jobs and technologies. And it is quite easy to learn, remember, and master. Since the first draft was published in February 1956, it has been repeatedly studied, revised, and reviewed by millions of people from top to bottom and from bottom to top, before becoming today's draft scheme. Therefore, the draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme shows that it is the most complete scheme since our country had its own phonetic scheme.

    Recently, Delegate Ye Shengtao went to Chengdu and Chongqing to convey Premier Zhou's report on "the current task of language reform" and organized a symposium on the draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme with the participation of people from all walks of life. People at the meeting spoke enthusiastically and put forward some technical and procedural opinions, unanimously supporting Premier Zhou's report and the draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. I suggest that the congress approve the draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme submitted by the State Council and pass the report made by Director Wu Yuzhang at the congress.

    Five Suggestions for Promoting Phonetic Writing
    After the draft scheme is approved and promulgated by the congress, I suggest:

    1.  The CPPCC organizations and relevant departments in all parts of the country should continue to launch vigorous publicity to eliminate certain doubts that may arise from the promotion of Mandarin Chinese and the phonetic alphabet scheme, and penetrate the publicity work into all aspects of society to form a broad, mass and lasting movement.
    2.  The Chinese textbooks for all grades of primary schools, especially the textbooks for the first grade, should use the phonetic alphabet immediately, so as to avoid the more than 10 million children who enroll this year from still having to learn the phonetic alphabet and then having to convert it in the future. The Chinese phonetics chapter in middle schools should also be compiled according to the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.
    3.  The Chinese language departments of higher normal colleges and the graduating class of secondary normal schools this year should learn the phonetic alphabet scheme, master phonetic skills, and be proficient in Mandarin Chinese, so as to teach and promote the phonetic alphabet scheme in primary and secondary schools.
    4.  The Chinese Language Reform Committee and relevant departments should train cadres to promote the phonetic alphabet scheme in a timely manner, and draw them from relevant departments in various places, train them, and then return to work in various places. And consider how to train primary and secondary school teachers in batches in various places.
    5.  Publish a more complete dictionary compiled according to the phonetic alphabet scheme as soon as possible, which is the most important tool for promoting Mandarin Chinese and promoting the phonetic alphabet scheme.

    The current task of language reform in our country: simplifying Chinese characters, promoting Mandarin Chinese, and promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, is conducive to eliminating illiteracy more, faster, better, and more economically, popularizing and improving science and culture, and is conducive to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and accelerating the socialist construction of the country. This is in line with the interests of 600 million people, is jointly demanded by the masses, and is therefore bound to be jointly accepted by the masses. This is determined by the objective laws of social development and cannot be changed by people's subjective will. Therefore, it is neither, as the rightist element Zhang Bojun falsely accused, aroused by a few people, nor, by the same token, will it ever be extinguished by the rightist elements' delusions. I wholeheartedly support the current task of language reform and strive to do this work well.

    文字改革可以多快好省地扫除文盲
    张秀熟代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。现在我就文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案发表一些意见。
    逐步做到人民语音的接近和统一
    具有充分可能和优越的物质基础
    语言和文字，是一定社会的人们表达思想、交流思想从而共同促进社会物质文化生活的重要媒介和工具，它是社会历史发展的客观产物，它是要随着社会历史的发展而发展。今天我们的国家，已发展到在政治、经济、文化上空前的团结和统一，全国人民在党和政府领导之下团结一致，为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗；目前还存在着的由历史遗留下来的语音纷歧、语言隔阂现象，已与整个社会的发展不相适应，在政治、经济、文化生活上都带来一定的困难，因此人民群众迫切需要一种共同的语言，来更好地共同促进社会物质文化生活，加速地建成社会主义社会，这是社会发展客观规律所决定。同时，在当前我们国家政治、经济、文化空前团结和统一这一从古未有的条件下，逐步作到人民语言的接近和统一，已不只是理想和要求，而是具有充分可能的、空前优越的物质基础。而在语言本身方面，作为共同语言来说，占将近六亿使用汉语人民中百分之七十以上人民所使用的北方话，便又是可利用的现成的基础。因此，推广以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言的普通话，作为汉民族的共同语言，也可说是全国各民族的共同语言，并且把这工作作为当前的一项重要政治任务来看待，我认为是非常正确的。事实证明，几年来我们在这方面工作虽然已经取得一定的成效，但是从客观情况讲，我们仍是落后于人民群众的需要的。
    汉字简化虽“急就”却救急  简化的字还不够多不够好
    其次，表达汉语的汉字本身所存在的难识、难读、难写、难记等缺点，我们的先民早就有了感慨，而在当前，更特别突出地与社会发展的客观需要不相适应。把人民群众中流行已久、约定俗成的简体字经过审查予以合法化，并在原有汉字的基础上，根据一定原则新创简体字，这是简而易行、虽“急就”、却救急、再好不过的事。两年来的事实证明，汉字简化是受到人民群众的一致欢迎，在普及文化方面收到一定的功效。目前的问题是简化的字数还不够多，不够适应需要，少数的字还简化得不够好。因此，报告中提出：“必须继续积极推进，使所有比较常用的、笔画较繁的字都能得到逐步简化”；“集中群众中的智慧，加以整理，把它纳入统一的规范。”我认为很是适当。我更欢迎全国文字改革委员会在这一工作上是“采取积极的态度”。
    学习、记忆、掌握都相当容易  这是我国最完善的拼音方案
    为了推广普通话，逐步作到全国人民——首先是汉民族能掌握一种共同语言，为了解决汉字形音分离、难识难读的矛盾，必须由国家制定一套普遍通行的拼音字母，作为工具，来统一音读，帮助注音。一九五七年十一月一日国务院所通过公布并提交此次大会讨论批准的汉语拼音方案草案，是继承我国两千多年来“直音”、“反切”直到注音字母的传统，更是六十年来中国人民创造拼音方案的经验总结。它的最大的、根本性的优点，正是由于它采用了音素化的拉丁字母。作为标音的字母符号来说，现行的注音字母所存在若干缺点，汉语拼音方案草案都得到克服。（参考张世禄“拼音字母比注音字母优越得多”——“文字改革”一九五八年一月号第四十三页）它不仅可以统一音读，为汉字注音，帮助推广普通话；它并且便利于记录少数民族的语言，作为设计少数民族的文字的共同基础；此外，它对于促进国际文化交流，统一科学技术译名，以及交通、邮电、工商、出版各部门某些工作和技术上的需要，都具有一定的、不可缺少的作用。而且学习、记忆、掌握都相当容易。从一九五六年二月第一个草案公布后，经过上千万人自上而下、自下而上反复多次的研究、修订、审议，才成为今日的方案草案。因此，汉语拼音方案草案，表现出是我国自有拼音方案以来比较最完善的方案。
    最近叶圣陶代表到成都、重庆传达周总理“当前文字改革的任务”的报告，并组织了由各方面人士参加的关于汉语拼音方案草案的座谈会，会上发言的人甚为踊跃，提出了有关技术上和步骤上的若干意见，一致拥护周总理的报告和汉语拼音方案草案。我建议大会批准国务院所提交的汉语拼音方案草案，并通过吴玉章主任在大会所作的报告。
    推广拼音文字的五点建议
    在方案草案经大会批准公布后，我建议：
    一、全国各地政协组织及有关部门，应继续展开大力宣传，消除对推广普通话和拼音方案可能产生的某些疑虑，把宣传工作渗透到社会各方面，形成广泛的、群众性的持久运动。
    二、本年秋季的小学各年级语文教材特别是一年级的教材，应即使用拼音字母，以免今年入学的一千多万儿童，仍要学习注音字母，将来又须转换。中学汉语语音篇，亦应即根据汉语拼音方案编写。
    三、高等师范院校中国语文系科及中等师范学校本年应届毕业生，应学习拼音方案，掌握拼音技能并熟练普通话，以便在中小学进行教学并宣传推行拼音方案。
    四、中国文字改革委员会和有关部门，应及时训练推行拼音方案的干部，在各地有关部门抽调，训练后回各地工作。并考虑各地如何分期分批，对中小学教师进行训练。
    五、尽快出版根据拼音方案编写的比较完善的字典，这是推广普通话和推行拼音方案的最重要的工具。
    当前我国文字改革的任务：简化汉字，推广普通话，推行汉语拼音方案，有利于更多、更快、更好、更省地扫除文盲，普及和提高科学、文化，有利于工农业生产大跃进和加速国家社会主义建设，这是符合六亿人民的利益，为群众所共同要求，因此必然为群众所共同接受。这是社会发展客观规律所决定，不能以人们的主观意志为转移。因此既不是如右派分子章伯钧所诬蔑是由少数人兴起来的，同一道理，也就决不是右派分子所妄想能够灭得下去的。我衷心拥护关于当前文字改革的任务并为作好这一工作而奋斗。
