　　Sterilization – Which Partner Should Undergo the Surgery?
　　A couple is tired of contraception and wants a permanent solution – sterilization. This is perfectly acceptable, as they already have five children. The problem lies in: should the husband or the wife undergo the surgery? They have been arguing about it and have not reached a conclusion.
　　This article does not intend to criticize their thinking, but rather to compare the two options from a medical perspective.
　　First, a simple comparison table is presented below:
　　　　Vasectomy　　　　　　　　Tubal Ligation
　　Suitable time for surgery: Can be done at any time.　Best performed within hours after childbirth.
　　Difficulty and safety of surgery: A small incision can be made on both sides of the scrotum to perform the surgery, which can be completed in 5-20 minutes. The surgery is simple and safe.
　　Postpartum surgery is simpler, but can be performed at any time, taking 5-20 minutes. The surgery is simple and safe. Surgery is more complex. Requires half an hour to an hour.
　　Pain:　Very little pain under local anesthesia.　Slight discomfort when opening the abdominal wall.
　　Hospitalization and cost: No hospitalization required. The patient can return home after outpatient surgery. The cost is very low.　Hospitalization is required, and the cost is higher.
　　From the table above, it can be seen that vasectomy has more advantages than tubal ligation. Therefore, under normal circumstances, it is more convenient for the husband to undergo the surgery. If the following special circumstances exist: 1. The husband has a serious illness; 2. The wife is pregnant or postpartum; 3. The wife intends to undergo repair surgery due to vaginal relaxation or urinary or fecal incontinence caused by excessive childbirth. In these cases, it is more appropriate for the wife to undergo the surgery.
　　Perhaps husbands have some concerns: Will vasectomy cause weight gain, changes in temperament, premature aging, or loss of sexual function? The answer is no. The vas deferens has no other physiological function besides transporting sperm. Male characteristics and sexual physiology are caused by male hormones (hormones). These hormones are produced by the interstitial cells of the testicles, then absorbed by the blood and distributed throughout the body. The functions of the vas deferens and the testicles are completely different. Ligation of the former has absolutely no relation or effect on the latter.

### 绝育——究竟谁动手术好？

　　绝育——究竟谁动手术好？
    有一对夫妇，对于避孕已经不胜其烦，要求一劳永逸——绝育。这原无不可，因为他们已经有了五个孩子。问题在于：由丈夫还是由妻子动手术好？两人争论不休，至今没个结果。
    这里不想来批判他们的思想，只是从医学上来比较一下。
    先列一张简单的比较表如下：
　　结扎输精管　　    结扎输卵管
　　合适手术时间：　随时可做。　最好在产后数小时内进行。
　　手术难易和安全性：　在阴囊两侧作小切口，就可进行手术，5—20分钟即完成，手术简单安全。
　　产后手术较简单，平时就可进行手术，5—20分钟即完成，手术简单安全。进行手术较复杂。需时半小时到一小时。
　　痛苦：在局部麻醉的情况下，极少痛苦。  在打开腹壁时稍有不适。
　　住院和费用：不需住院，门诊手术后即可返家，费用很省。  需住院，费用较多。
    从上表可知，结扎输精管的优点多于结扎输卵管。所以，在一般情况下由丈夫方面动手术比较方便。如果有下列特殊情况：一、丈夫有严重疾病；二、妻子已怀孕或正在产后；三、妻子因生育过多引起阴道松弛或大小便失禁现象，正拟进行修补手术。在这些情况下，则由妻子方面动手术比较妥当。
    也许丈夫们有些疑虑：结扎了输精管，会不会引起发胖、性情改变、早衰、性机能丧失等现象？回答是不会。输精管除了输送精子外，并没有其他生理作用。男子性征、性生理的一些现象，发自男性激素（荷尔蒙）。这种激素是由睾丸的间质细胞制造的，然后被血液吸收，分布到全身。输精管、睾丸两者之间的功能迥异，结扎前者同后者绝无关系，也绝无影响。
