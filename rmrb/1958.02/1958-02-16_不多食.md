    "Don't Overeat"
    Meng Gudai
    The room has just been thoroughly cleaned, and it looks exceptionally bright and clean. The host, feeling the chill of early spring, specially lit a roaring fire in the stove. The firelight reddened everyone's faces in the room, and they felt warmth from the bottom of their hearts. Everyone loosened their clothes and took off their hats, chatting and laughing, busily setting the table and arranging the bowls. In a short while, the table was filled with delicacies, steaming hot; the hosts and guests sat around, playing drinking games, raising their cups and exchanging toasts. ... During the New Year and festivals, every household loves to eat and drink, which is a folk custom of our nation to celebrate the Spring Festival. Especially now, family members and relatives have taken time off from their various posts in socialist construction, after a year of vigorous and enthusiastic work, it is a good opportunity to gather, express their feelings, talk about the year's heroic spirit and achievements, and express their determination and drive for the coming year. Amidst the happy conversation, they inevitably drink heartily. After eating and drinking! The old world has been turned upside down in our hands, and now we have become experts in building socialism, erecting tall buildings on flat ground!

    However, don't get drunk and fall down, don't eat too full! We still have to immediately throw ourselves into the high tide of construction!

    Pavlov said: Don't be like Peter Petrovich Peiskhe in "Dead Souls"; those landlords didn't eat to live, but lived to eat. Lomonosov (also a brilliant Russian scholar) also said: Moderate diet is a guarantee of health; eating too much of any kind of food will produce many incurable diseases. Even Confucius in ancient China, after talking about a set of dietary hygiene principles, added a sentence "don't overeat", telling people not to eat too much.

    During the Spring Festival, if we are not restrained, we often tend to eat and drink heavily, gorging ourselves. Not only does this waste manpower and resources, but the more unpleasant consequence is getting stomach problems. Among them, many people suffer from acute gastroenteritis on the spot. Because the stomach is like a leather ball, although it can expand and contract, it has a certain limit. Suddenly eating too much food, it will be filled and burst. Moreover, the food during the Spring Festival is often glutinous rice cakes, zongzi, yuanxiao, peanuts, fried pastries, etc., which are more sticky, oily, or raw, cold, sour, and spicy, and very stimulating foods, which are inherently difficult to digest. As the saying goes: "Eating fatty meat makes you lose your appetite." Indeed, these foods will stimulate the stomach wall and paralyze the gastric glands, thus losing your appetite. As for alcohol, drinking a little can excite the nerves, but drinking too much will paralyze the nerves, causing neurasthenia and intellectual decline.

    Some people often eat and drink heavily, although they don't get stomach problems, they gradually become obese. This is also not a good phenomenon. They often have many abnormalities in their metabolism; their resistance to various infectious diseases is very poor; even mild labor makes them feel exhausted; the heart also works harder, leading to breathing difficulties. All of these will contribute to shortening their lifespan.

    In short, please cherish our health and wealth, control our eating and drinking during the Spring Festival, so that we can devote ourselves to construction with more energy.

    “不多食”
    孟固代
    这屋子刚刚大扫除过，显得格外窗明几净。主人感到春寒料峭，特地燃起一炉熊熊的火。火光映红了屋里每个人的脸，都感到从心底温暖起来。大家宽衣脱帽，笑谈着，又七手八脚地铺桌摆碗。只一会，但见满桌珍肴，热气腾腾；主客们团团围坐，豁拳行令，觥筹交错。……过年过节，家家户户都爱吃喝一番，这是我们民族欢庆春节的一个风俗习惯。特别是现今，一家人以及亲戚朋友从社会主义建设的各个岗位上休假下来，各自轰轰烈烈、热火朝天地干了一年，正好借此聚会，畅叙情怀，说一说这年的豪情和劳绩，表一表来年的干劲和决心。欢谈之余，不免开怀畅饮起来。吃罢！喝罢！旧世界已在我们手里翻了筋斗，如今我们又成了建设社会主义的能手，平地建起了大厦高楼！
    但是，不要喝得醉倒，吃得太胀饱！我们还要立即投入建设的高潮中去哩！
    巴甫洛夫说过：不要像“死魂灵”里的彼得·彼得洛维奇·胚士赫一样；他们那些地主不是为了活着才吃，而是为了吃才活着的。罗蒙诺索夫（也是俄罗斯的一位天才学者）也说过：有节制的饮食，是健康的保证；各种食物吃得过饱，就会产生许多无法医治的疾病。就是我国古代的孔子，在谈了一套饮食卫生的话的末后，也加上一句“不多食”，叫人不要吃得太多。
    我们在春节，如果不加节制，往往容易大吃大喝，暴饮暴食。浪费了人力物力不算，更不愉快的后果是得肠胃病。其中当场得急性肠胃炎的，也大有人在。因为胃像一个皮球，虽然能胀能缩，却有一定限度。突然吃下过量食物，它会被盛满撑破的。况且，春节中的食物，常是些年糕、粽子、元宵、花生米、油煎点心等粘性较大、油质较多，或者生、冷、酸、辣很有刺激的食物，本来不容易消化。俗语说：“吃肥肉，倒胃口”，的确，这些食物会刺激胃壁，使胃腺麻痹，因而倒了胃口。至于酒，少饮些能兴奋神经，多饮了却麻痹神经，引起神经衰弱和智力减退的现象来。
    有些人经常大吃大喝，虽未见肠胃得病，却日渐肥胖起来。这也不是好现象。他们，在新陈代谢方面往往有许多失常的地方；抵抗各种传染病的能力很差；轻度的劳动也会感得疲乏不堪；心脏工作也困难些，随而引起呼吸困难。凡此种种，会促使寿命减短。
    总而言之，请珍惜我们的健康和财力，节制春节的吃喝，以便我们更加精力充沛地投入建设中去。
