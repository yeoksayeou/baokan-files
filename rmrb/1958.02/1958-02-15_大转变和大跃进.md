    Great Transformation and Great Leap Forward
    Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    1957 was a year of great change in the work style of cadres in Hong'an County. The great transformation of cadre work style promoted a great leap forward in agricultural production. In 1957, Hong'an County suffered a fairly severe drought; however, the total grain output of the county increased by two-tenths compared to the bumper year of 1956, reaching more than 800 jin per mu. Peanut production averaged 600 jin per mu, an increase of 26% compared to 1956. Income from various sideline occupations increased by more than 140% compared to 1956. In addition to various crops, there were significant increases in pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, fish, and rabbits. The people of Hong'an County said that 1957 was a year of "overall harvest, increased production in every cooperative," "bumper harvest of all grains," and "five colors shining brightly"; people praised the scene of the harvest, "Rice is like gold, peanuts fill the fields with green, cotton is like snow white, commune members' faces are red," "overall harvest, increased production in every cooperative." This was indeed a huge victory. The practical experience of Hong'an County shows that by adopting a comprehensive planning and crop-specific responsibility approach, focusing on increasing grain, cotton, and oil production, it is possible to rapidly develop forestry, aquatic products, and various sideline occupations. By adopting the method of grasping the two ends to drive the general, it is possible to eliminate backward townships, backward cooperatives, and backward teams, thereby eliminating cooperatives with reduced production and achieving the goal of increased production in every cooperative.

    In the winter of 1956, the Hong'an County Party Committee, based on the instructions of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on hard work and thrift in national construction, started by cracking down on unhealthy tendencies (at that time, some cadres were developing bourgeois ideas of seeking pleasure and disliking work), rectified cadre thinking, and adopted the methods of streamlining the upper levels, transferring cadres to lower levels, strengthening backward townships and cooperatives, and having leading cadres take fixed responsibility for specific crops and areas, reversing the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres sitting in offices and running around without going deep among the masses. According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee on leading cadres participating in production and leading production, the main responsible cadres of the Hong'an County Party Committee took the lead in participating in production. In the process of participating in production, they discovered that running experimental plots was the best way to participate in production and lead production. Leading cadres, technical personnel, and local farmers who were skilled in production cooperated to run experimental plots, and the successful experiences obtained through experimentation were shown to relevant cadres throughout the county for observation, and on-site meetings were held. This not only prevented subjectivism and commandism in leadership but also made it easier and faster to promote advanced experiences. After more than a year of efforts, Hong'an County not only achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production but also reaped a harvest in improving the ideological work style and working ability of cadres. The vast number of cadres learned production skills by running experimental plots and gained the trust and love of the masses. They developed a strong affection for the masses, for the land, and for the crops. They transformed from "people in the countryside with their hearts in the city" to "people in the city with their hearts in the countryside," and "bodies in the cooperative with their hearts in the fields." Those who were full of official airs and were once satirized by the masses as "inspectors" and "acting like nobles" were praised by the masses as technicians and good servants of the people after they had earnestly changed their work style. The secretary of the Hong'an County Party Committee, the county head, and other responsible cadres personally took the lead in running experimental plots, participating in production, and leading production. The masses of Qili Town said, "Secretary Zhang (Zhang Jingtian) is really like a peasant. The secretary takes the lead in picking manure, so we don't have trouble with fertilizer; the secretary takes the lead in farming, so we don't have to worry about increasing production."

    The Hong'an County Party Committee was not satisfied with past achievements. They put forward the fighting goal for 1958: "Everything must be experimented with, everything must be innovated, production must leap forward, and a double thousand jin must be achieved" (referring to producing 1,000 jin of grain per mu of paddy field and 1,000 jin of peanuts per mu). According to this policy and task, the county party committee first summarized, promoted, and developed the experience of cadres cultivating experimental fields. Since the winter sowing last year, all 23 members of the county party committee have had experimental fields, and most of the other office cadres, district and township cadres, and primary and secondary school teachers have cultivated experimental fields. The county party committee required cadres working in rural areas to: "Each person cultivate two mu of land, produce 3,000 jin of grain and oil (an average of 1,500 jin of grain and peanuts per mu), accumulate 400 dan of fertilizer, and work 500 labor days." The county party committee decided to make the cultivation of experimental fields a regular system for training cadres, improving cadres' ideological awareness, and learning production technology, so as to achieve "both red and expert." Now, the experimental fields cultivated by cadres in Hong'an County have been combined with the large-area high-yield fields cultivated by the masses in the cooperatives. Cadres and cadres, masses and cadres compete with each other, and a upsurge in cultivating high-yield fields has been launched. The vast majority of cooperatives have established technical committees, and the vast majority of cadres in cooperatives and teams have run experimental fields. Under the leadership of 15 district and township cadres, Qili District, along the banks of the Panyang River, jointly cultivated a 2,500-mu high-yield field. The slogan "Work hard, study diligently, learn assiduously, and practice arduously to become both red and expert" appeared among the cadres. The slogan "Everyone strives to be a pioneer, everyone strives to maintain glory" appeared among the masses. Hong'an County, an old revolutionary base area that has experienced hundreds of battles, is advancing valiantly towards building a new socialist Hong'an with the heroic spirit of "turning the world upside down in three years of hard work," in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory."

    We know that the development of all things is unbalanced, and the difference between advanced and backward will never be completely eliminated. In 1957, Hong'an County adopted the leadership methods of grasping key points, grasping the backward, and grasping new things. For backward townships, backward cooperatives, backward teams, backward fields, and backward seedlings, they adopted the method of responsible layers, stringing pearls on a line, to promote the backward to catch up with the advanced and achieve increased production in every cooperative and increased production throughout the county. Recently, in addition to learning advanced experiences from other places and summarizing and promoting local advanced experiences, they also launched a mass inspection and evaluation throughout the county, led by more than 2,000 township and cooperative cadres in four groups, led by responsible cadres of the county party committee, to conduct mutual inspections, mutual evaluations, commend the advanced, and promote the backward. A mobile office was organized, headed by Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county party committee. They carried telephones and farm tools, contacted wherever they went, solved problems on the spot; and participated in production wherever they went. If they discovered and studied problems of county-wide significance, they would hold on-site meetings or use wired broadcasting to organize cadres above the level of production team leader throughout the county to listen to broadcast conferences. In this way, experiences were quickly exchanged and work was promoted.

    The work style of the Hong'an County Party Committee, which is deeply rooted in reality, lively and vigorous, connected to the masses, and relying on the masses, is a concrete application of the mass line repeatedly taught by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In recent months, cadres from many counties in our province and other provinces have visited Hong'an County to learn. People have said that Hong'an County's methods are good and the cadres' work style is good. The experience of Hong'an County shows that there must first be a great transformation of the work style of cadres in order to lead the masses to achieve a great leap forward in production; it also shows that the key to transforming the ideological work style of cadres lies in the main responsible cadres at the county level having full revolutionary vigor, setting an example, taking the lead in working hard without fear of difficulties, and persevering to the end, not just having five minutes of enthusiasm, not just a gust of wind, and not giving up halfway. As long as leading cadres participate in production, cultivate experimental plots, and all innovations are first tested, so that they have a clear understanding and can let go to mobilize the masses and fully develop the wisdom and strength of the people, then leading a large-scale production upsurge and realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production will certainly be guaranteed.

    大转变和大跃进
    中共湖北省委第一书记　王任重
    1957年是红安县干部作风大转变的一年。干部作风的大转变，促进了农业生产的大跃进。1957年红安县遭受到相当严重的干旱；但是全县粮食的总产量却比丰收的1956年增加了十分之二，达到了亩产粮食八百斤以上。花生产量平均每亩六百斤，比1956年增加26％。各项副业收入比1956年增加140％还多。除了各种农作物以外，猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鱼、兔都增加了不少。红安县的人民说1957年是“样样丰收、社社增产”，“五谷丰登”，“五色鲜明”；人们歌颂丰收的景象，“稻谷似黄金，花生满畈青，棉花如雪白，社员满面红”，“样样丰收，社社增产”，这确实是一个巨大的胜利。红安县实践的经验表明，采取全面规划、分作物负责的办法，抓住粮、棉、油增产为重点，同时可以使山林水产和各项副业得到迅速的发展。采取抓两头带动一般的方法，可以消灭落后乡，落后社，落后队，从而消灭减产社，达到社社增产的要求。
    红安县委在1956年冬季，根据党的八届二中全会关于艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的指示，从打击歪风邪气（当时在部分干部中滋长着贪图享乐、好逸恶劳的资产阶级思想），整顿干部思想入手，采取了精简上层、下放干部、加强落后乡、落后社、领导干部分作物与分片固定负责的办法，扭转了领导干部坐机关和跑来跑去、不深入群众的官僚主义作风。根据党中央关于领导干部参加生产领导生产的指示，红安县委的主要负责干部首先带头参加了生产。在参加生产的过程中，摸索到搞试验田是参加生产领导生产的最好方法。领导干部、技术人员和当地农民中的生产能手三者合作搞试验田，把经过试验得到成功的经验，让全县有关的干部来参观，并召开现场会议。这样既能防止领导上的主观主义、命令主义，又能比较容易比较迅速地推广先进经验。经过一年多的努力，红安县不仅在农业生产上取得了丰收，在干部思想作风、工作能力的提高上同样得到了丰收。广大干部因搞试验田而学到了生产的本领，得到了群众的信任和爱戴。对于群众，对于田地、对于庄稼都发生了浓厚的感情。从“人在乡下心在城里”转变成“人在城里，心在乡下”，“身在社里心在田里”了。那些官气十足的人，曾经被群众讽刺为“检察官”，“摆来摆去像个相公”；在切实改变了作风以后，被群众称赞为技术员和人民的好勤务员。红安县委书记、县长和其他负责干部，都是亲自带头搞试验田，参加生产，领导生产。七里镇的群众说：“张书记（张景田）真像个庄稼汉，书记带头拣粪，我们的肥料不为难；书记带头种地，我们更不愁增产”。
    红安县委没有满足于过去的成就，他们提出了1958年的奋斗目标：“样样要试验，事事要革新，生产大跃进，实现双千斤”（指每亩水田产粮食一千斤，每亩花生产一千斤）。根据这个方针和任务，县委首先把干部培育试验田的经验加以总结推广和发展。自从去年冬播以来，县委二十三个委员人人都有了试验田，其他机关干部和区乡干部、中小学教员大部分人都培育了试验田。县委对农村工作的干部要求：“一人两亩地，粮油三千斤（每亩平均要收粮食和花生一千五百斤），积肥四百担，劳动五百分。”县委决定把培育试验田作为锻炼干部，提高干部的思想觉悟，学习生产技术，达到“又红又专”的一种经常化的制度。现在红安县干部培育的试验田，已经与合作社群众培育的大面积丰产田结合起来了。干部和干部，群众和干部互相比赛，培育丰产田的热潮已经开展起来了。绝大多数合作社建立了技术委员会，绝大多数社、队的干部都搞了试验田。七里区在十五个区乡干部的带动下，沿潘阳河两岸，合作社联合培育了一个二千五百亩的丰产畈。在干部中出现了“苦干、苦钻、苦学、苦炼，做到又红又专”的口号。在群众中出现了“人人当先锋，个个保光荣”的口号。红安县这个身经百战的老苏区，正在按着毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，以“苦战三年扭转乾坤”的英雄气概，为建设社会主义的新红安奋勇前进。
    我们知道一切事物的发展都是不平衡的，先进和落后的区别是永远不会完全消灭的。红安县在1957年就采取了抓重点、抓落后、抓新鲜事物的领导方法。对于落后乡、落后社、落后队、落后田、落后苗，采取了层层负责，一线串珠的办法，促使落后赶上了先进，实现了社社增产和全县增产。最近他们除了向外地学习先进经验和总结推广本地先进经验之外，又在全县开展了一次群众性的检查评比，由县委负责干部分四片分别带领乡、社干部两千余人参加，进行了互相检查，互相评比，表扬了先进，推动了落后。以县委第一书记程鹏同志为首组织了一个流动办公室，他们带着电话机和农具，走到那里在那里联系，发现问题就地解决；走到那里在那里参加生产。如果发现和研究了具有全县意义的问题，就地召开现场会议，或者利用有线广播组织全县生产队长以上干部收听广播大会。这样就很快地交流了经验，推动了工作。
    红安县委这种深入实际、生动活泼、联系群众、依靠群众的工作作风，是党中央和毛主席一再教导的群众路线的具体运用。近几个月来，我省和外省有许多县的干部到红安县参观学习，人们都说红安县的办法好，干部的作风好。红安县的经验表明，必须首先有干部作风的大转变，才能带领群众实现生产的大跃进；同时表明，转变干部思想作风的关键，在于县级主要负责干部具有十足的革命干劲，以身作则，不怕困难地带头干，并且坚持到底，不要只有五分钟的热度，不要一阵风，半途而废。只要领导干部参加生产，培育试验田，一切革新首先经过试验，做到心中有数，又能放手发动群众，充分发挥人民群众的智慧和力量，这样领导大规模的生产高潮，实现农业生产的大跃进，就一定有把握。
