The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a decision on carrying out three activities among children nationwide: planting trees, eliminating the four pests, and speaking Mandarin. The decision states: Planting trees and afforesting the motherland is an activity in which children can contribute and learn a lot of knowledge, making it most suitable for children to participate in. Therefore, children must be mobilized to actively participate in the tree-planting and afforestation movement. Wherever conditions permit, children's nurseries and children's forests should be established. After-school education institutions such as children's palaces and children's homes should first establish experimental nurseries and experimental gardens. In large cities with limited open space, soil pots and wooden boxes should be used as much as possible to cultivate seedlings, which will then be transplanted.

Planting sunflowers and castor beans to increase the production of oil crops for the country is a good tradition of the Young Pioneers, and we should continue to promote it, using all available land to plant sunflowers and castor beans, planting as much as possible. Now that the people of the whole country are making great strides towards the goal of transforming nature and greening the motherland, every child should become an enthusiastic member of tree planting and afforestation, striving to green the motherland, so that barren hills are covered with green gauze, the earth is adorned with colorful clothes, fruits hang on branches, and oil crops grow everywhere.

Eliminate the four pests, emphasize hygiene, and carry out patriotic health campaigns. We must call on children to actively kill sparrows, catch rats, and eliminate flies and mosquitoes, becoming experts in eliminating the four pests. Furthermore, we must resolutely work hard and carry on to the end, striving to make our families, schools, streets, and villages free from the four pests. Children themselves must be clean and hygienic, developing good habits such as changing clothes frequently, washing hands before meals, and washing faces and brushing teeth every day. We must make children a vigorous and radiant generation, eradicating the bad habits left over from the old society at their roots.

Promoting Mandarin is an important measure in China's language reform and a major issue related to the interests of the people of the whole country. The Young Pioneers must find various ways to help everyone learn to speak Mandarin and carry out activities to learn to speak Mandarin, such as listening to the radio, performing plays, reciting poems, and holding speech contests, creating a wave of enthusiasm for learning to speak Mandarin. The Young Pioneer organizations should support and encourage children who work hard to learn Mandarin. Young Pioneers who are illiterate should also strive to learn to read and write and acquire culture, striving to recognize more than 1,500 characters by the time they leave the team at the age of fifteen, and not be illiterate.

The decision finally requires that, in order to widely and deeply carry out these three activities among children nationwide, the Communist Youth League committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, conscientiously do a good job in the long-term planning of the above tasks, train activists, and exchange experiences in a timely manner. By commending advanced individuals and motivating the backward, we should arouse the children's enthusiasm for learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced.

The grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League are responsible for helping the Young Pioneers formulate plans and select outstanding members of the Communist Youth League to provide guidance.

At present, we must focus on these three activities, create momentum, and achieve results, so that the work of the Young Pioneers and the great practice of socialist construction in the motherland are more closely linked, and so that the Young Pioneers and the vast number of children can grow up better in this vivid communist education.

    团中央号召少年儿童植树、除四害、讲普通话
    本报讯　共青团中央发出了关于在全国少年儿童中开展植树、除四害、讲普通话三项活动的决定。决定中说：植树造林、绿化祖国，是少年儿童又能出力，又能学到许多知识，最适宜于少年儿童参加的一项活动。因此，要把少年儿童动员起来，积极参加植树造林运动。凡是有条件的地方，都要建立少年苗圃、营造少年林。少年宫、少年之家等校外教育机关要首先建立实验苗圃和实验园地。在空地不多的大城市里，也要尽量利用土盆、木箱、培育树苗，然后进行移植。
    种植向日葵和蓖麻，为祖国增产油料作物，这是少先队的好传统，我们应该继续发扬它，利用一切可以利用的土地，种植向日葵和蓖麻，能种多少就要种多少。现在全国人民正在向改造自然、绿化祖国的目标大进军，每一个少年儿童都要成为植树造林的热心分子，努力绿化祖国，使荒山披青纱，大地穿花袄，果儿挂满枝，遍地长油料。
    除四害、讲卫生，开展爱国卫生运动。我们要号召少年儿童积极打麻雀、捉老鼠、消灭苍蝇和蚊子，成为除四害的能手。并且要坚决干、干到底，努力使自己的家庭、学校、街道、村庄做到四无。少年儿童自己要做到人人爱清洁、人人讲卫生，养成勤换衣服、饭前洗手、天天洗脸刷牙的好习惯。要使少年儿童成为朝气蓬勃、精神焕发的一代，把旧社会遗留下来的坏习气连根拔掉。
    推广普通话，是我国文字改革的一个重要措施，是关系到全国人民利益的大事情。少先队要想各种办法来帮助大家学讲普通话，开展学讲普通话的活动，如听广播、演戏、朗诵诗歌、举办演讲比赛等；掀起一个学讲普通话的热潮。少先队组织应该支持和鼓励努力学习普通话的孩子。不识字的少先队员还要努力识字、学文化，争取到十五岁离队的时候，能够认识一千五百字以上，不做文盲。
    决定中最后要求：为了在全国少年儿童中广泛、深入地开展这三项活动，各级团委必须加强领导，切实做好以上几项工作的远景规划，训练积极分子，及时交流经验。通过表扬先进，带动落后，鼓起少年儿童学先进、比先进、赶先进的火热劲头。
    共青团的基层组织要负责帮助少先队制订计划，选派优秀团员进行辅导。
    目前要着重抓住这三项活动，造成声势，做出成绩，使少先队工作和祖国社会主义建设的伟大实际更紧密的联系起来，使少先队员和广大少年儿童在这种生动的共产主义的教育中更好的成长起来。
