Early Spring Night in Shacheng
	Zou Difan

	Under the moonlight, I returned from the Xiyulin Township group meeting of the Huailai County 1958 Production Great Leap Forward Oath Rally. The streets of Shacheng Town lay quietly in the moonlight, the low doors and windows all closed. Only the stovepipes exposed outside the houses were still smoking, telling me that people were sound asleep in the warm and peaceful town.

	Although it was still the coldest time of the year, and the sharp wind whistled intermittently, after leaving the group meeting, I only felt a stream of spring water rushing in my heart, just like the spring water in front of the meeting venue gate in Shacheng Town, gurgling and echoing in the early spring moonlight.

	This was my first lesson after being sent to the countryside, and from the discussion of pig raising by the villagers this evening, it opened the first lesson of socialist education for me.

	At that group meeting, twenty or so villagers squatted on two rows of wooden plank beds. These twenty or so people included the deputy secretary of the township party committee, the chairman of the agricultural cooperative, the production committee member, the director of the township women's federation, and the production team leader. I was a cadre sent to the countryside, and I also came to participate in the group meeting. A kerosene lamp illuminated people's faces. The meeting place was originally a classroom of Huailai Middle School, and now it has become a temporary dormitory for representatives of Xiyulin Township, and also a group meeting place.

	The smoke from the kerosene lamp and the smoke from the villagers' dry tobacco pipes filled the room. The excited faces of the people and the loud arguments made everyone in the room feel unusually warm.

	The villagers began by discussing the speeches of Secretary Zhao and Deputy Secretary Wang of the county party committee at the conference, examining their own conservative ideas, and discussing the county party committee's call: "The county should produce 10,000 mu of grain at 1,000 jin per mu, 100 mu of sweet potatoes at 10,000 jin per mu, 20 to 30 cooperatives should cross the Yellow River, the plains should be irrigated, the mountains should be terraced, the whole county should become a surplus grain county, and every cooperative should exceed the level of a rich middle peasant..." The topic naturally focused on the issue of pig raising, because Xiyulin was a key and advanced township in pig raising in the entire county, and even in the Zhangjiakou Special District.

	Indeed, the county party committee had issued a call to raise 100,000 pigs in 1958. In the "Production List" registration room specially opened at the conference, Xiyulin had already registered 10,000 pigs on the list. However, after listening to the self-criticism of the county party secretaries about their conservative ideas, the villagers also launched criticism on the issue of pig raising. Deputy Township Secretary Zhang Wenliang and Cooperative Chairman Gao Shuyun both said: "We all have right-leaning conservative ideas. If we don't dig them out, it won't work. In 1956, we only had seven sows and three hundred meat pigs. In 1957, we raised more than 1,300. Now that we are carrying out the Great Leap Forward, we registered 10,000. We have made progress, but it can't be considered a Great Leap Forward..."

	The production committee member搶着 said, "We have eighteen production teams. Let's calculate it carefully. Each team should focus on one team. Each team should report the planned number and evaluate it. Whoever is conservative should be pinched with pliers to eliminate their conservative ideas."

	So, each production team leader reported the number of pigs they were preparing to raise, not just reporting the number, but also explaining how to complete the plan. For example, first calculate how many sows there are in the cooperative. Some sows can give birth to two litters a year, some can only give birth to one litter. Calculate six piglets per litter, and how many piglets the cooperative is still short. Where to find a way to get them. Where will the money to buy piglets come from? How many households in the cooperative have not raised pigs? How many sows and meat pigs does each household have? Everyone calculated bit by bit. After Fu Ming's team explained its pig raising measures, it proposed a number for the pig raising Great Leap Forward. He couldn't help sticking out his tongue and saying: "Am I being too aggressive?"

	Li Jun twirled his short beard: "What are you being aggressive about? Saying that shows some conservative thinking!"

	Everyone laughed. After calculating the total number, the cooperative could raise more than 16,000 pigs in 1958. Ten teams could raise more than 1,000 pigs each. Xiyulin only has 900 households and more than 4,000 people, which means that each household has to raise sixteen or seventeen pigs on average, and each person has to raise four pigs, an increase of more than ten times compared to 1957.

	Zhang Wenliang said: "Ideological mobilization is very important. Men have to work, and women have to be mobilized too. If women don't cook or feed the pigs, the male cooperative members can't work, and the pigs can't be raised." Zhang Guilan, director of the Women's Federation, continued: "Of course women have to be mobilized. It's not enough to just hold meetings of party members, League members, and group leaders. It's not enough to just hold cooperative member meetings. Female cooperative members always have some special things to deal with, and they often don't attend cooperative member meetings, so we have to hold separate women's meetings. Also, the economic income from raising pigs in the future must be clearly calculated. Some households' mothers-in-law put all the money earned from raising pigs into their own pockets, which affects the enthusiasm of their daughters-in-law."

	Someone said with a smile: "Hey, look at this director of the Women's Federation!"

	Someone was calculating how many families had not raised pigs. When they calculated, most of them were single men or poor households. They figured that ten single men could raise pigs together, as long as one person was specifically responsible for raising them, and the other people could allocate a portion of their earned work points to him. There was no problem for poor households. The cooperative could help them get a loan from the credit cooperative so they would have money to buy piglets.

	Watching their excited and enthusiastic discussion, I sat aside and followed their emotions. I regretted that I hadn't read any books on pig raising problems to contribute some reference opinions. But one question hung in my mind, and that was the question of pig feed. On the one hand, I was afraid that they would neglect this issue. On the other hand, I was still based on the habit of raising pigs that I had seen in the South when I was a child. Pigs have to eat grain, and the county I had come to was striving to become a surplus grain county. I couldn't help but tug at the sleeve of a young production team leader, Meng Yufeng, and asked: "Raising so many pigs, won't it affect the grain?"

	"No, no, our cooperative has a 'Youth Pig Farm,' and we've done a lot of experiments. Now we all use silage feed. Last year, our township also held an exhibition, and at least forty kinds of weeds can be used as pig feed. Just put it in a pit and let it ferment. It can ferment in as little as four days in the summer. Last year, we collected 460,000 jin of silage."

	"What are some of the weeds?"

	He reeled off a list like a family treasure: "Cocklebur, water spinach, water celery, duckweed, big butt grass... Oh, and it's not just weeds, peanut leaves, peanut skins, yam stems, carrot roots, sunflower heads, beet leaves... Oh, there's a lot, I can't count them all."

	The group meeting ended at ten o'clock because there was another conference the next morning. When I walked out of the meeting place, my feelings were complex. At the meeting, I only discovered my lack of production knowledge. But walking in the moonlight, I thought deeply step by step, and I found that these grassroots cadres had extremely valuable things. They were enthusiastically responding to the central Party's call for a Great Leap Forward in production from a corner of our land. Their trust in the Party was not empty talk, but practical action. In action, they carefully calculated the details, so they were full of confidence, forging ahead courageously, without any exaggeration. It wasn't that there were no difficulties, but they didn't feel any difficulties at all, so the group meeting became a joyous symphony. The so-called "difficulties" only produced action measures. People would say: they are arduous, but when they don't feel arduous and only feel the joy of building a socialist countryside, then the onlookers who feel the hardship can only be said to not have invested in their fiery socialist revolutionary movement.

	In the small conference room of this Shacheng outside the Badaling Mountains, on such a cold moonlit night, they were enthusiastically discussing the issue of China's rural socialist construction, a big issue of world significance. I also believe that in every corner of the Chinese countryside, the issue of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production is being discussed at these times. Thinking of these things, I felt that I had drawn some strength from the masses.

	Tomorrow, I will set off to Xiyulin Township. I wish the villagers of Xiyulin Township a peaceful sleep on this night.

    沙城初春夜
    邹荻帆
    踏着月色，我从出席怀来县1958年生产大跃进誓师会的西榆林乡小组会上回来。沙城镇的街市，静静地躺在月色中，平矮的门窗都已闭上，只有露在屋外的炉烟管还冒着烟，它告诉我，人们是在温暖而宁静的村镇里睡熟了。
    虽然这正是四九寒天，峭峻的风还时远时近的吹着口哨，但是，从小组会场出来，我只感到心里激流着一股泉水，就像沙城镇边那会场大门前的一道泉水一样，在初春月夜潺潺地流响着。
    这是我下放后的第一课，就从乡亲们在这晚上讨论养猪的问题上，给我揭开社会主义教育的第一课。
    在那小组会上，二十几个乡亲们蹲在两排对列的木板床上，这二十来人是乡党委副书记、农业社社长、生产委员、乡妇联主任、生产队长，我是一个下放干部，也来参加了小组会。一盏煤油灯照着人们的脸庞。这会场原是怀来中学的教室，现在成了西榆林乡代表的临时宿舍，也是小组会场。
    煤油灯的烟和乡亲们抽的旱烟袋的烟，弥漫了一室，人们兴奋的嘴脸，大声争辩的发言，竟使一屋子的人都感到异常的热和。
    乡亲们开始是在讨论县委赵书记和王副书记在大会上的讲话，检查自己的保守思想，讨论着县委的号召：“全县要出现万亩千斤粮，百亩万斤薯，有二、三十个社过黄河，平川水利化，山地梯田化，全县变成余粮县，社社超过富裕中农……”话题很自然地集中到养猪这个问题上，因为西榆林在全县，甚至在全张家口专区，都是养猪的重点乡和先进乡。
    是的，县委提出过号召，要在1958年养猪十万口，在大会特辟的“生产榜”挂号室内，西榆林已经在榜上挂了养猪一万口，可是听了县委书记们检查了保守思想之后，乡亲们也就养猪的问题，展开了批评。乡副书记张文亮和社长高淑云都在说：“我们都有右倾保守思想，不挖掉可不成。1956年，我们才七口母猪，三百来口肉猪，1957年我们就搞到了一千三百多口，现在搞大跃进，我们挂了一万口，进是进了，总不能算大跃进……”
    生产委员抢着说：“我们有十八个生产队，来好好的算一算帐就行了，一队抓一队，各队都把计划数目报出来评评，谁要保守了就用老虎钳子来拧，拧他的保守思想。”
    于是各个生产队长，都报出自己准备养猪的数目，不只是报数目，还要说出完成计划的办法。比如说，先算社里有多少口母猪，有的母猪在一年能生两窝，有的只能生一窝，一窝按六口计算，全社还差多少子猪，要从哪儿想办法。买子猪的钱从哪儿来，全社还有多少没有养猪的空白户，哪一家有多少母猪和肉猪，大家都一点一点计算着。傅明的队在说了自己养猪的措施之后，提出养猪大跃进的数目字，他自己不禁伸了伸舌头说：“我是不是冒进了？”
    李钧翘了翘短胡须：“你冒进啥？说这话倒是有点保守思想！”
    大伙都乐了起来。一算总数，1958年全社能养一万六千多口，有十个队都养到千口以上。西榆林才九百来户，四千多口人，那就是说平均每户要养十六、七口猪，每人要养四口猪，比1957年增加了十倍以上。
    张文亮说：“思想动员可重要，男的要出工，妇女也得动员；妇女不给做饭，不给喂猪食，男社员就出不了工，猪也养不成。”妇联主任张桂兰接着说：“妇女当然得动员，光开党团员和组长的会是不行的，光开社员大会也不行，女社员总是有些特别事，社员大会常常不参加，得单独开妇女的会。还有啊，将来养猪的经济收入，也得算清楚，有些户的婆婆们，把养猪赚的钱一齐装到她自己口袋去了，这就影响了媳妇的积极性。”
    有人笑着在说：“嘿，瞧这妇联主任！”
    有人在计算还有多少家没有养猪，一算时，多半是单身汉或贫困户。对单身汉，他们捉摸可以让上十个单身汉合起来养猪，只要一个人专门负责养，其他几个人就可以将自己挣的工分，分一部分给他。对贫困户更没有问题，社里可以帮他向信用社贷款，让他有钱购买子猪。
    看着他们兴奋而热烈讨论的劲头，我坐在一旁也跟着他们的情绪在跳动，我恨自己平常没有看一点关于养猪问题的书，来贡献一点参考性的意见。但是有一个问题横在我心头，这就是猪食料的问题。一方面我是怕他们忽略了这问题，另一方面我还是根据儿时在南方看到养猪的习惯，猪是要吃粮食的，而我所来到的县，正在为变成余粮县而奋斗，我忍不住扯着一位年轻的生产队长孟玉峰的膀子问了一声：“养这么多猪，不会影响粮食？”
    “不会，不会，我们社里有个‘青年养猪场’，都有过好多试验了，现在都用青贮食料，去年我们乡里还开了个展览会，至少有四十种野草都能做猪食，把它放在坑里一发酵就行，暑天只要四天就能发酵。去年我们就采了四十六万斤青贮。”
    “有哪些野草？”
    他如数家珍地念着：“苍秧、水菠菜、水芹菜、水浮萍、大屁股草……呃，还不光是野草哩，花生叶、花生皮、山药茎、胡萝卜根、葵花头、甜菜叶……噢，多哩，数也数不清。”
    小组会到十点钟就结束了，因为第二天早晨还有大会。当我从会场走出来，我的感受是复杂的，在会场上，我只发现自己生产知识的缺乏，但踏着月光，我一步步沉思，我发现了就在这些基层干部们的身上，有着极其可贵的东西，他们是那样热烈地从我们土地上的一个角落，热烈响应党中央的生产大跃进的号召。他们对党的信任，不是空洞的发言，而是实际的行动。在行动中，他们又那样踏踏实实地算清细帐，因此信心百倍，勇往直前，丝毫没有虚夸。不是没有困难，而是他们丝毫不感到困难，因而小组会变成了欢乐的交响乐，所谓“困难”，只产生了行动的措施。人们会说：他们是艰苦的，但是当他们并不感到艰苦，而只感到建设社会主义农村的愉快，那么，有艰苦感的旁观的人，只能说是没有投入他们这火热的社会主义革命运动中。
    在八达岭外的这座沙城的小会议室中，在这样寒冷的月夜，他们正在热烈地讨论着关系中国农村社会主义建设的问题，一个富有世界意义的大问题。我也相信，在中国农村的每一个角落，都在这些时候讨论农业生产大跃进的问题，我想着这些，我感到从群众中吸取了一些力量。
    明天，我将动身到西榆林乡去，我祝福西榆林乡的乡亲们都在这夜晚有安静的睡眠。
