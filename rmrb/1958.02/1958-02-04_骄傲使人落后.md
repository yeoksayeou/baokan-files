Pride Makes One Lag Behind
By our correspondent Xiao Ming

　　Gaoping District in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, was the most advanced area in the county for many years after liberation. In 1953, the county piloted twelve agricultural cooperatives, and Gaoping District accounted for ten of them. At that time, the production movement was in full swing, and Gaoping was at the forefront of the county in terms of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and farming techniques. In 1952, Gaoping District had already seen high yields of over 900 catties per mu on small areas. The Huang Guoliang mutual aid team, and the primary cooperative established on the basis of the Huang Guoliang mutual aid team, were provincial models of high yield for several years.

　　Since 1955, the pace of progress in Gaoping District has been significantly slower compared to other districts, and some districts that were originally behind it have caught up. Compared with Songlin District, which is adjacent to it, in terms of net income per farmer: in 1952, Gaoping District was 39 yuan, and Songlin District was 24 yuan; in 1955, Gaoping District was 59 yuan, and Songlin District was 44 yuan; in 1957, Gaoping District was 71 yuan, while Songlin District reached over 96 yuan. Moreover, in 1957, the public income portion of Gaoping District accounted for 65% of the total public income, while Songlin District accounted for 64.2%. Savings accounts in Songlin District accounted for 80% of the total number of households, while Gaoping District only had 30%. Gaoping District used to be the district with the most pigs, but now Gaoping has an average of two pigs per household, while Songlin has reached four pigs per household. Other economic crops such as flue-cured tobacco, hemp, and peanuts, as well as livestock such as cattle, sheep, and poultry, have all surpassed Gaoping in Songlin.

　　"Insufficient drive" is the basic reason for the slow pace of progress in Gaoping District. However, why is there insufficient drive in Gaoping District? At the four-level cadre meeting convened by the Zunyi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the cadres of Gaoping District, in conjunction with the discussion of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), conducted in-depth debates on the above issues.

　　Chairman Mao said: "Modesty makes one progress, pride makes one lag behind." Gaoping District has mainly lagged behind due to pride and complacency. The cadres of Gaoping District generally have the idea of ​​"work is done, and production has reached its peak." They believe that they can sit back and relax and stay ahead every year just by relying on Gaoping's good fields and good soil. Therefore, some cadres take a lukewarm attitude towards the experience of increasing production in other places and the production plans and measures for increasing production proposed by higher authorities. This is particularly evident in the work of vigorously developing pig raising. As early as the spring of 1957, in addition to setting targets for each district, the county party committee also pointed out that the main difficulty in raising pigs at that time was the lack of sows. At that time, the masses were generally unwilling to feed sows, fearing that more piglets would be worthless, and fearing that it would affect their work points in the commune. In response to this situation, the county party committee proposed a measure for cooperatives to take the lead in collectively feeding sows. This measure was resolutely implemented in Songlin District, and party members, league members, township, and commune cadres took the lead in feeding sows under the leadership of the district party committee. At the same time, each township and commune also solved some specific problems. These measures ensured the rapid development of sows, and now the entire district has an average of one sow for every two households.

　　This measure was not well implemented in Gaoping District. Many commune cadres felt that feeding pigs, especially feeding sows, was both troublesome and worrying. Li Shengquan, the director of Xinglong Commune, collectively fed sixty pigs when he was the head of a mutual aid team, but now he is unwilling to feed even one. The district party committee did not study specific solutions to this situation. In this way, the development of pigs in Gaoping District has been very slow.

　　The same situation was also manifested in the promotion of the advanced experience of rice "triangular planting." Songlin District promoted more than 9,000 mu, reaching 26% of the paddy field area, exceeding the target assigned by the county. However, Gaoping District only promoted more than 2,000 mu, accounting for 10% of the paddy field area, and did not complete the task assigned by the county.

　　Every year, after the various indicators stipulated by the county are issued, the Gaoping District Committee also makes plans, with indicators for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, but they do not conduct serious research and inspection, so most of them fail except for grain production, which is given more attention. Although the district party committee attaches more importance to grain production, the rate of increase in grain production is much slower than that of Songlin due to the lack of fertilizer caused by the failure of animal husbandry to keep up, and the lack of attention to the promotion of advanced experience. In 1955, the average yield per mu in Gaoping was 533 catties, and Songlin was less than 337 catties; in 1957, Gaoping was 731 catties, and Songlin also reached 729 catties. The average yield per mu in Gaoping can still be two catties higher than that of Songlin, mainly because Gaoping has better water conservancy conditions and more paddy field area than Songlin.

　　Unlike Gaoping District, Songlin District has measures for various production activities in mountainous areas as long as there is a plan. They plant mulberry trees, cultivate tea, try to raise wild silkworms, vigorously develop animal husbandry, and develop economic crops such as flue-cured tobacco, hemp, and peanuts. They also established a so-called "small farm" in Lianchi Commune, which is the district's experimental field. They experiment with various farming techniques and varieties, and repeatedly experiment with double-cropping rice and double-cropping corn. They have also successfully tested "five harvests a year" on the small farm. Because Songlin District has better implemented the mountainous area production policy of "combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations with grain production as the mainstay," their production outlook is changing rapidly, the masses are working harder and harder, and they are more active and concerned about collective production.

　　The production outlook in Gaoping District has not changed much in recent years. Some commune members have gradually lost interest in the collective production of the commune, and the capitalist ideas of some commune members, especially the wealthy middle peasants, have been raised, and they are engaged in individual development. For example, Huang Guoliang, the leader of the formerly provincial model high-yield mutual aid team, has not been involved in the work of the commune since the winter of 1956, and has not actively completed the commune's fertilizer accumulation plan. He has been making palm ropes at home all day, and later bought horses to engage in individual transportation. Under the influence of Huang Guoliang, seven households in the production team where Huang Guoliang was located bought eight and a half horses. Other commune members saw that these people did not do the work of the commune and went out to earn more than one yuan a day, so they were not at ease with the production of the commune. This increasingly active capitalist thinking has dissipated the emotions of the commune members and seriously affected production. Originally, the farming season in Gaoping District was about half a month earlier than in most parts of the county, but in the past two years, it has been half a month later than in most parts of the county.

　　The county party committee also bears some responsibility for this stagnation in the work of Gaoping District, which has lasted for two years. For a long time, the county party committee has also been proud and complacent for Gaoping District, believing that Gaoping has a good working foundation, strong cadre quality, and high mass awareness, so it has not paid enough attention to the work of Gaoping District.

　　The obvious contrast has shocked the cadres of Gaoping District, and they have realized that their neighbors have already gone from behind to the front.

　　骄傲使人落后
　　本报记者　萧明
    贵州遵义县的高坪区，解放以后的多年中，一直是全县最先进的地区。1953年全县试办了十二个农业社，高坪区就占了十个。那时生产运动搞得轰轰烈烈，无论是水利、积肥，还是耕作技术，高坪都在全县拔尖。1952年高坪区就出现过小面积平均亩产九百斤以上的高额产量。黄国良互助组，以及以后在黄国良互助组基础上建立的初级社，好几年里都是全省的丰产模范。
    1955年以来，高坪区前进的步伐，与其他各区相比显著的缓慢了，一些原比它落后的区反而赶到它的前边。用与它相接邻的松林区相比，从农民每人的纯收入来看：1952年高坪区为三十九元，松林区为二十四元；1955年高坪区为五十九元，松林区为四十四元；1957年高坪区为七十一元，而松林区却达到九十六元以上。而且1957年公共收入部分，高坪区占公共总收入的65％，松林区占64.2％。松林区的存款户占总户数的80％，高坪区只有30％。高坪区过去是养猪最多的区，现在高坪平均每户有两头，松林每户已达四头。其他如经济作物中的烤烟、麻、花生，牧畜业中的牛、羊、家禽等，松林都已居高坪之前。
    “劲头不足”是高坪区前进步伐缓慢的基本原因。然而，高坪区为什么劲头不足呢？在中共遵义县委召开的四级干部会议上，高坪区的干部，结合着对农业发展纲要（修正草案）的讨论，对以上问题进行了深入的辩论。
    毛主席说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。高坪区主要由于骄傲自满而落后了。高坪区的干部普遍存在“工作到头、生产到顶”的思想。认为只靠高坪的好田、好土就能稳坐钓鱼台，年年都走在前边。因而部分干部，对外地的增产经验，对上级提出的生产计划、增产措施，都一律采取冷淡态度。特别明显的表现在大力发展养猪的工作上。还在1957年春天的时候，县委除向各区提出指标以外，还指出当时大量养猪的主要困难，是母猪少。当时群众又普遍不愿喂母猪，怕小猪多了不值钱，怕影响在社里得工分。针对这种情况，县委提出由合作社带头集体喂母猪的措施。这项措施在松林区坚决贯彻了，各乡、社在区委领导下，党、团员，乡、社干部都带头喂母猪。同时各乡、社也解决了一些具体问题，这一些措施保证了母猪的迅速发展，现在全区平均每两户有一头母猪。
    这项措施在高坪区却没有很好的贯彻。很多社干部嫌喂猪特别是喂母猪既麻烦又操心，兴隆社社主任李胜泉，在当互助组组长时，他的互助组集体喂了六十头猪，现在却一头也不愿喂。而区委对这种情况也没有研究具体办法。就这样，高坪区的猪发展得很缓慢。
    在推广水稻的先进经验“三角丛植”上，也表现了同样情况。松林区推广了九千多亩，达到稻田面积的26％，超额完成县里分配的指标。而高坪区只推广了二千多亩，占水田面积的10％，没有完成县里分配的任务。
    每年在县规定的各项指标下达以后，高坪区委也同样作出计划，农、林、牧、副样样有指标，但都不作认真研究和检查，因而除粮食生产抓的较紧外，其他大多落空。虽然区委对粮食生产比较重视，但由于牧业没有跟上，土地缺少肥料，加上对先进经验推广重视不够，粮食的增产速度也比松林慢得多。1955年高坪的平均亩产量为五百三十三斤，松林还不足三百三十七斤；1957年高坪为七百三十一斤，松林也达到七百二十九斤。高坪的平均亩产量，所以还能比松林高两斤，主要由于高坪水利条件好，水田面积比松林多。
    与高坪区不同，松林区对山区各项生产，只要有计划，就有措施。他们植桑、育茶，试养野蚕，大力发展畜牧，发展烤烟、麻、花生等经济作物；他们还在莲池社办了个所谓“小农场”，即是区的试验田。试验各种耕作技术和品种，反复的试验双季稻和双季苞谷。他们还在小农场上试验成功了“一年五收”。由于松林区比较好的贯彻了“以粮食生产为主的农、林、牧、副相结合”的山区生产方针，因而他们的生产面貌日新月异，群众越干越有劲，对集体生产更加积极和关心。
    高坪区的生产面貌，几年来变化不大。部分社员对社的集体生产兴趣逐渐淡薄，有一部分社员、特别是富裕中农的资本主义思想抬头，搞个人发展。如曾是省的丰产模范互助组的组长黄国良，从1956年冬天开始，不管社的工作，不积极完成社的积肥计划，整天在家打棕绳，以后又买马搞个人驮运。黄国良所在生产队，在黄国良的影响下，七户人就买了八匹半马。其他社员看到这些人不干社的活，出去一天就是一块多，因而也不安心社的生产。这种资本主义思想的日渐活跃，涣散了社员的情绪，给生产以严重影响。原来高坪区的农事季节比全县大部分地区都早半月左右，这两年来反而比全县大部分地区晚了半月左右。
    高坪区工作上的这种停滞现象，所以能持续两年之久，县委领导上也有一些责任。长期以来县委也在替高坪区骄傲自满，以为高坪工作基础好，干部质量强，群众觉悟高，因而对高坪区的工作注意研究不够。
    显明的对比，使高坪区的干部大吃一惊，原来他们的邻人已经从后边走到前边来了。
