The Chinese government issued a statement on February 7, fully endorsing and supporting the peaceful initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5 regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese government stated that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea on a regular basis and is prepared to consult with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea; at the same time, it requests the U.S. government and the governments of other countries participating in the United Nations Command to take similar measures to withdraw U.S. troops and all other foreign troops from South Korea. This significant step taken by the Chinese government in peacefully resolving the Korean issue is of great significance for breaking the stalemate currently created by the United States in Korea, promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea, and easing tensions in the Far East. This once again demonstrates the sincere desire of the Chinese government and people for peace.

The entry of the Chinese People's Volunteers into Korea and the U.S. military's aggression against Korea are of completely different natures. The Chinese people launched the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea after the United States launched a war of aggression against Korea and simultaneously occupied China's territory of Taiwan. At that time, the U.S. aggressors disregarded the warnings of the Chinese people and world public opinion, ordering its invading forces to cross the 38th parallel on a large scale and advance towards the Yalu River, seriously threatening China's security. Obviously, the U.S. aggressors were then copying the old trick of the Japanese militarists of first occupying Korea and then invading China. In view of this painful historical lesson, the Chinese people naturally could not ignore the serious war situation at that time, and dispatched their own sons and daughters -- the Chinese People's Volunteers -- to cross the Yalu River, fighting side by side with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to jointly resist aggression and defend their homeland. The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, with the full sympathy and strong support of peace-loving countries and peoples, after nearly three years of arduous and heroic fighting, finally drove the U.S. aggressors back to where they originally launched the war of aggression -- the 38th parallel, forcing the United States to cease fire. The great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers, combining patriotism and internationalism, will be forever recorded in history, because it not only strongly supported the struggle of the Korean people and defended the security of the motherland, but also made a great contribution to world peace. The Chinese People's Volunteers went abroad to fight entirely for peace. Today, the Chinese government agrees to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and is prepared to consult with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea in order to break the stalemate created by the United States in resolving the Korean issue and promote the early realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea, also entirely for peace.

The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a prerequisite for achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is very clear. Foreign troops remaining in Korea, with both sides confronting each other, will only continue to make the Korean region a dangerous point of war, making it impossible to fundamentally ease the tension there. Only by withdrawing all foreign troops can favorable conditions be created for the genuine stable peace of Korea. At the same time, foreign troops remaining in Korea will only artificially deepen the division between North and South Korea, thus causing great misfortune to the Korean nation. Only by withdrawing all foreign troops can the Korean people solve their own problems without foreign interference. Precisely because of this, since the Korean armistice, the Chinese and Korean sides have repeatedly proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. This proposal is fully in line with the interests of the people of North and South Korea and the people of all countries participating in the Korean War. Obviously, since there is a ceasefire, why should foreign troops remain in Korea? However, the United States has blatantly rejected this proposal. Moreover, the United States has even signed a so-called mutual defense treaty with the Syngman Rhee clique and has repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, shipping large quantities of weapons, including atomic weapons, into South Korea, turning South Korea into its military base and colony. This practice by the United States not only puts the people of South Korea in dire straits, causing the entire Korean people to continue to suffer the pain of division, but also plunges the Korean issue into a long-term stalemate, causing the Korean situation to continue to deteriorate. Therefore, now all peace-loving people will see that to break the stalemate on the Korean issue and to stop the continued deterioration of the Korean situation, we must first demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea!

Today, the entire international situation is trending towards relaxation, and the tide of demanding peace and opposing war, demanding consultation and opposing the Cold War, is rising. The U.S. military buildup activities in Korea have been met with increasingly strong opposition from the Korean people and the people of Asia, placing it in a more isolated position. Under these circumstances, the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is obviously timely. And it is entirely understandable that the Chinese government fully supports these proposals and is willing to take a positive attitude and strive to promote the realization of these proposals.

Korea is China's close neighbor, separated from China only by a strip of water. Our two countries have a fraternal friendly relationship of interdependence, like lips and teeth sharing the same fate. Especially after the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of our two countries have formed an unbreakable fighting friendship, flesh and blood connected. The Chinese people cannot but care about the peace and security of Korea. Our two countries have helped each other in the past, and we will inevitably continue to help each other in the future. We believe that the Chinese government's agreement to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and its readiness to consult on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea will be conducive to the Korean people solving their own problems and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and easing tensions in the Far East is the firm policy consistently pursued by the Chinese government. The Chinese government and people have been making continuous efforts in the past to promote the easing of the situation in the Far East and promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and will never spare their strength in the future. We hope that all countries concerned about peace in the Far East and the world will take a positive attitude towards the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and take effective actions to promote the early withdrawal of the U.S. invading forces and all other foreign troops from Korea, so that the long-standing desire of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland can be realized, and the security of Korea and peace in Asia can be guaranteed.

### 打开朝鲜问题的僵局

　　打开朝鲜问题的僵局
    我国政府于2月7日发表声明，完全赞同和支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国2月5日关于从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队、和平统一朝鲜的和平倡议。我国政府声明，一切外国军队应当定期撤出朝鲜，并且准备就中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出的问题同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府进行磋商；同时要求美国政府和参加联合国军方面的其他各国政府同样采取措施，从南朝鲜撤出美国军队和其他一切外国军队。我国政府在和平解决朝鲜问题上采取这个重大步骤，对于打开美国目前在朝鲜所造成的僵持局面，促使朝鲜和平统一，以及缓和远东紧张局势，都具有重大的意义。这再一次表现了我国政府和人民谋求和平的真诚愿望。
    中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜和美国军队侵略朝鲜，具有截然不同的性质。中国人民是在美国发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时侵占了我国的领土台湾之后，才展开抗美援朝运动的。当时，美国侵略者无视中国人民和世界舆论的警告，命令它的侵略部队大举越过三八线，进逼鸭绿江边，严重地威胁了中国的安全。很显然，美国侵略者当时是抄袭过去日本军国主义者首先占领朝鲜进而侵略中国的故技。中国人民鉴于这种沉痛的历史教训，对于当时的严重的战争情况当然不能置之不理，才派遣自己的子弟兵——中国人民志愿军渡过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一道并肩作战，共同反抗侵略，保家卫国。中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军在一起，在爱好和平的国家和人民的充分同情和大力支持下，经过将近三年的艰苦卓绝的英勇战斗，终于把美国侵略军打退到它原来发动侵略战争的地方——三八线，迫使美国停战。我国人民志愿军的这种爱国主义和国际主义相结合的丰功伟绩，将永垂史册，因为它不仅有力地支持了朝鲜人民的斗争，保卫了祖国的安全，并且对世界和平作了伟大贡献。我国人民志愿军出国作战，完全是为了和平。今天，我国政府赞同从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，并准备同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府磋商从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军的问题，以打破美国在解决朝鲜问题上所造成的僵持局面，促使朝鲜和平统一的早日实现，也完全是为了和平。
    一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，是实现朝鲜和平统一的先决条件。这个道理是十分清楚的。外国军队留在朝鲜，双方对峙，只会使朝鲜地区继续成为一个战争的危险点，不可能从根本上缓和那里的紧张局势。只有撤退一切外国军队，才能为朝鲜的真正稳定的和平创造有利的条件。同时，外国军队留在朝鲜，只会人为地加深南北朝鲜的分裂局面，从而造成朝鲜民族的极大不幸。只有撤退一切外国军队，才能够使朝鲜人在不受外来干涉的条件下，自己解决自己的问题。正是因为这样，从朝鲜停战开始，中朝方面就一再提出了从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的建议。这个建议是完全符合南北朝鲜人民和所有参加朝鲜战争的各国人民的利益的。很显然，既然停战了，为什么还要外国军队留在朝鲜呢？但是，美国却悍然拒绝了这个建议。而且，美国竟和李承晚集团签订了所谓共同防御条约，并一再违犯朝鲜停战协定，向南朝鲜运入大批武器以至原子武器，把南朝鲜变为它的军事基地和殖民地。美国这种做法，不但使南朝鲜人民处于水深火热中，使整个朝鲜人民继续遭受分裂的痛苦，而且使朝鲜问题长期陷于僵局，使朝鲜局势继续恶化。因此，现在一切关心和平的人们都会看到，要打破朝鲜问题的僵局，要制止朝鲜局势的继续恶化，就必须首先要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜！
    今天，整个国际局势正在趋向缓和，要求和平反对战争、要求协商反对冷战的潮流日益高涨。美国在朝鲜的备战活动已经遭到朝鲜人民以及亚洲人民的越来越强烈的反对，使它处于更加孤立的地位。在这种形势下，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的建议，显然是适时的。而我国政府完全支持这些建议，并愿采取积极态度，为促成这些建议的实现而努力，也是完全可以理解的。
    朝鲜是中国的近邻，同中国只有一水之隔。我们两国有着唇齿相依、休戚与共的兄弟般的友好关系。特别是经过抗美援朝的伟大斗争，我们两国人民更结成了血肉相连的牢不可破的战斗友谊，中国人民不能不关心朝鲜的和平和安全。我们两国过去是互相帮助的，今后也必然还要互相帮助。我们认为，我国政府赞同从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，并准备磋商从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军，将有利于朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题，实现朝鲜的和平统一。
    和平解决朝鲜问题，和缓远东紧张局势，是我国政府所一贯奉行的坚定政策。我国政府和人民为了促使远东局势的缓和，促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，过去曾经不断进行努力，今后也决不会吝惜自己的力量。我们希望一切关心远东和世界和平的国家，都对和平解决朝鲜问题采取积极的态度，用有效的行动来促使美国侵略军队和其他一切外国军队早日撤出朝鲜，使朝鲜人民和平统一自己祖国的长久愿望得以实现，使朝鲜的安全和亚洲的和平得到保障。
