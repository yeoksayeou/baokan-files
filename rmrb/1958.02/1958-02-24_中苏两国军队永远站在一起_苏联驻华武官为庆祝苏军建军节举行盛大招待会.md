Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Soviet Military Attaché in China, Major General Zudov, and his wife, held a grand reception in Beijing on the evening of February 23rd to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army.

Among those invited to the reception were: Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier Marshal He Long, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Su Yu, Vice Minister of National Defense General Huang Kecheng, Vice Minister of National Defense and Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army General Tan Zheng, Vice Minister of National Defense and Commander of the Navy General Xiao Jingguang, Vice Minister of National Defense General Wang Shusheng, Commander of the Air Force General Liu Yalou, as well as heads of government departments and heads of various services and arms of the People's Liberation Army.

Heads of diplomatic missions and military attachés of various countries in China were also invited to the reception.

Soviet Ambassador to China, Yudin, also attended the reception.

Soviet Military Attaché in China, Major General Zudov, spoke at the reception. After briefly describing the great victories achieved by the Soviet people and army in fighting domestic and foreign enemies, he said that the Soviet people love peace and are fighting to establish friendship and cooperation among the people of all countries. The peace policy of our government is determined by the nature of the Soviet socialist state. The Soviet people of all nationalities, who are engaged in communist construction, do not need war.

Major General Zudov pointed out that imperialist aggressive blocs, primarily the United States, are pursuing a policy of "cold war," arms expansion and war preparations, and the establishment of new missile bases, preparing to launch a new world war. With the support of the United States, German militarism is being revived in West Germany. He said that the complex international environment and the interests of defending the motherland require the Soviet government and the Soviet people to maintain our national defense at the level of modern military science and technology. The Soviet army, which has been tested in victorious struggles against countless enemies of our motherland, closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet people, is vigilantly defending the peaceful labor and national interests of the Soviet people.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said in his speech at the reception that the heroic combat history of the Soviet army proves that any attempt by imperialist armies to invade the Soviet Union will inevitably meet with complete failure in the face of the powerful Soviet army. He said that now, the strength of the Soviet army and the Soviet state not only does not pose a threat to any other country, but on the contrary, it brings greater strength to the defense of world peace, greater support to the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations, and greater guarantees to the peaceful construction of the socialist camp.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army was built on the model of the Soviet army and will always stand together with the Soviet army. The close unity of the Chinese and Soviet armies cannot be broken by any force. The unity of the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union, the unity of the people and armies of all countries in the socialist camp, and the unity of peace-loving countries and people all over the world are a reliable guarantee for preventing imperialism from launching wars and maintaining world peace.

Ambassador Yudin spoke at the reception about the great significance of the Soviet Union's possession of intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial earth satellites. He said that the greatest happiness for mankind is that some of the most modern weapons are in the hands of the socialist country, the Soviet Union. It will not use these weapons to invade other countries, but will use these weapons to stop imperialism from launching wars. He said that the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries and their armies also possess weapons more powerful than intercontinental ballistic missiles, which is the Marxism-Leninism possessed by socialist countries and the working class around the world.

During the reception, the guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate each other.

The reception proceeded in a friendly and warm atmosphere.

After the reception, a film evening was held, and the Soviet color feature film "Milestones of Fire" was shown.

    新华社23日讯　苏联驻华武官朱道夫少将和夫人，23日晚上在北京举行盛大招待会，庆祝苏军建军四十周年。
    应邀出席招待会的有：朱德副主席，周恩来总理，副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅，副总理贺龙元帅，副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅，副总理聂荣臻元帅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长程潜，国防委员会副主席张治中，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，中国人民解放军总参谋长粟裕大将，国防部副部长黄克诚大将，国防部副部长兼人民解放军总政治部主任谭政大将，国防部副部长兼海军司令员萧劲光大将，国防部副部长王树声大将，空军司令员刘亚楼上将，以及政府各部门负责人和人民解放军各军种、兵种负责人等。
    各国驻华使节和武官也应邀出席了招待会。
    苏联驻华大使尤金，也出席了招待会。
    苏联驻华武官朱道夫少将在招待会上讲了话。他简要地叙述了苏联人民和军队在同国内外敌人作战中所取得的伟大胜利之后说，苏联人民热爱和平，并为在各国人民间建立友谊与合作而斗争。我国政府的和平政策，取决于苏维埃社会主义国家的本质。正在从事共产主义建设的苏联各族人民不需要战争。
    朱道夫少将指出，帝国主义侵略集团，首先是美国正执行着“冷战”、扩军备战和建立新的火箭基地的政策，准备发动新的世界战争。在美国扶助下，德国军国主义正在西德复活。他说，复杂的国际环境和保卫祖国的利益，要求苏联政府和苏联人民将我国的国防事业保持在现代军事科学和技术的水平上。荣膺着战斗荣誉、在同我们祖国的无数敌人进行胜利斗争中久经考验的、紧密地团结在共产党和苏联人民周围的苏联军队，正警惕地捍卫着苏联人民的和平劳动和国家利益。
    彭德怀元帅在招待会上讲话说，苏联军队英勇的战斗历史证明，任何帝国主义军队侵略苏联的尝试，在强大的苏联军队面前，都必然要遭到彻底的失败。他说，现在，苏联军队和苏联国家力量的强大，不仅不会对任何别的国家有所威胁，而且恰恰相反，它给保卫世界和平带来了更大的力量，给一切被压迫民族的解放斗争带来了更大支持，给社会主义阵营的和平建设带来了更大的保证。
    彭德怀元帅说，中国人民解放军是以苏联军队为榜样建立起来的，是永远和苏联军队站在一起的。中苏两国军队的亲密团结，是任何力量都不能够拆散的。中苏两国人民和军队的团结，社会主义阵营各国人民和军队的团结，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，就是制止帝国主义发动战争、维护世界和平的可靠保证。
    尤金大使在招待会上谈到苏联拥有洲际弹道导弹和人造地球卫星的巨大意义。他说，人类最大的幸福是一些最新式的武器掌握在社会主义国家苏联手里。它不会拿这些武器侵略别的国家，而是用这些武器来制止帝国主义发动战争。他说，苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家及其军队，还拥有比洲际弹道导弹更强大的武器，这就是社会主义国家和全世界工人阶级所拥有的马克思列宁主义。
    席间，宾主频频举杯互相祝贺。
    招待会始终在友好、热烈的气氛中进行。
    招待会结束后，举行了电影晚会，放映了苏联彩色故事片“烽火的里程”。
