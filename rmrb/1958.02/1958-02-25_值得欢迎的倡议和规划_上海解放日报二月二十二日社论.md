Worthy of Welcome Initiatives and Plans
    ——Shanghai Liberation Daily Editorial, February 22nd

    Seventeen scientists from natural science research units in the Shanghai area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have issued a meaningful initiative: to be determined to become leftists, and strive to become scientific workers who are both Red and expert, and even Redder and more expert, within five years. Su Buqing, Vice President of Fudan University, Tan Jiazhen, Head of the Biology Department, and many other teachers from various schools have proposed individual progressive plans to be both Red and expert. Taking the five goals of self-education and self-transformation for intellectuals put forward by Comrade Ke Qingshi in the Municipal Party Congress report as their direction, they planned concrete ways to work hard. The proposal of these plans reflects the revolutionary drive of the scientists and their spirit of opposing conservatism, and is worthy of welcome.

    These initiatives and plans are meaningful because they directly embody the major victories that scientists and teachers have achieved in the political and ideological struggle in the past year. When the bourgeois rightists attacked the Party and the cause of socialism last spring, the rightists' slogan was that the Party could not lead science and universities ("laymen cannot lead experts"), advocating the use of capitalist free competition science and education policies to replace socialist science and education policies, opposing science serving socialist construction, and opposing intellectuals carrying out ideological transformation. Some well-intentioned but vaguely aware scientists and teachers, due to the influence of their long-term acceptance of bourgeois work, study, and lifestyles, and due to the limitations of metaphysical thinking methods, could not distinguish the simple truth that our socialist cause is good in nine fingers and only has a little problem in one finger, mistaking the tributaries for the mainstream, and the partial for the whole, and were once deceived by those wolves in sheep's clothing, doubting the Party's leadership and the socialist direction, and even thinking that the capitalist system was the best system for developing science and education. Thanks to this great struggle and great debate over the past year, right and wrong have been clarified. It is also thanks to the launching of two Soviet artificial satellites, which proved that the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist direction are the only guarantee for the development of science and education in our country. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no socialism, and of course no development of science and education. Many scientists and teachers did not originally oppose the Party's leadership and the socialist direction, but their initiatives and individual plans to be both Red and expert showed an even more firm position in supporting the Party's leadership and taking the socialist road, expressing their determination to further arm themselves with the Marxist theoretical foundation—dialectical materialism, and expressing a higher level of self-transformation consciousness. Therefore, these actions have become a sign of their major victory in the political and ideological struggle.

    These initiatives and plans are also meaningful because they point out what the most scientists and teachers should strive for in the current direction. Of course, as scientists and teachers, they should be expert and even more expert in their business. Our country's current scientific level is not high, and we should strive to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels. However, when bourgeois intellectuals waver in their political direction, the issue of political direction should be addressed first. For many scientists and teachers who are expert but not Red enough or not Red enough, they should work harder to solve the problem of "Redness." How can we be "expert" better, faster, and deeper? Only by placing the scientific cause under the leadership of the Party, placing scientific research and education in the general orbit of socialist construction, placing it under the guidance of Marxist thought, placing individuals in the collective, and placing intellectuals among the workers, peasants, and working masses. Only in this way can we cultivate red experts of the working class in a good, fast, and abundant way, and more closely integrate theory and practice, and rapidly improve the level of science and teaching. But to put science and education under the leadership of the Party and on the socialist track requires the scientists' awareness. Without this awareness, it is impossible to do so. Now no one openly opposes the ideological transformation of intellectuals, but the degree of consciousness of ideological transformation is clearly still uneven. Some people may think that it is enough as long as they do not oppose the Party and socialism, as long as they follow the Party; some people may think that after the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has achieved a decisive victory, after repelling the attack of the rightists, there is only the question of burying themselves in studying their business, and there is no need to continue to emphasize political and ideological issues. They do not understand that the political and ideological struggle has not ended; politics is and always will be the commander of economics, technology, and science today and in the future. From a national perspective, the socialist revolution in politics and ideology has achieved a basic victory, but for each individual, continuous efforts must be made to pass the test of socialism. The initiative and plan of scientists to be determined to become leftists and become even Redder and more expert demonstrates their demand for self-transformation and grasps the key to the problem.

    The scientists who put forward the initiatives and plans are not saying that they are not yet leftists in politics, but from the specific requirements they put forward, even scientists who are already leftists can continue to work hard, which is the reason for constantly becoming Redder and more expert.

    We welcome these initiatives and plans and hope that through the formulation and implementation of these plans, a movement of self-ideological transformation of scientists and intellectuals will be promoted. Only through this movement can the development of socialist science and education be better and faster promoted. We hope that all scientists in Shanghai will be determined to become leftists and respond to their initiative—"Everyone strive, plan individually, help each other in peacetime, evaluate at the end of the year, move step by step to the left, and strive to be thoroughly Red"—and strive to be a scientist who is both Red and expert!

    值得欢迎的倡议和规划
    ——上海解放日报二月二十二日社论
    中国科学院沪区各自然科学研究单位的十七位科学家发出一个有意义的倡议：下决心做左派，五年内争取成为又红又专更红更专的科学工作者。复旦大学副校长苏步青、生物系主任谈家桢等人及其他各校许多教师提出了个人又红又专的进步规划。他们以柯庆施同志在市党代会报告中提出的知识分子自我教育、自我改造的五项目标为方向，规划了具体努力的途径。他们的这些规划的提出，反映了科学家们的革命干劲和反对保守的精神，是值得欢迎的。
    这些倡议和规划之所以有意义，是因为它直接体现出科学家和教师们在近一年来的政治思想斗争中已经取得了重大的胜利。当去年春天，资产阶级右派分子向党和社会主义事业进攻的时候，右派的口号是党不能领导科学和高等学校（“外行不能领导内行”），主张用资本主义自由竞争的科学和教育政策来代替社会主义的科学和教育政策，反对科学为社会主义建设服务，反对知识分子要进行思想改造。一些好心的但是认识模糊的科学家和教师，由于自己长期接受了资产阶级的工作、学习、生活方式的影响，由于形而上学的思想方法的限制，分不清我们社会主义的事业九个指头是好的、只有一个指头有点毛病这一简单的道理，把支流误为主流，把局部当作全体，曾经被那些披着羊皮的狼所欺骗，对党的领导与社会主义方向发生怀疑，甚至以为资本主义制度才是发展科学和教育事业的最好制度。多亏得一年来这场大斗争、大辩论，到底辨明了是非。也亏得苏联两颗人造卫星上了天，证明共产党的领导和社会主义的方向，是我国发展科学和教育事业的唯一保证。离开共产党的领导，就没有社会主义，当然也就没有科学和教育事业的发展。许多科学家和教师本来就不反对党的领导和社会主义方向，但他们的倡议和个人又红又专的规划却表示了更坚定地拥护党的领导与走社会主义道路的立场，表示了进一步以马克思主义的理论基础——辩证唯物主义来武装自己的决心，表示了更高的自我改造的觉悟性。因此，这些行动就成为一个他们在政治思想斗争中取得重大胜利的标志。
    这些倡议和规划之所以有意义，还在于它指出了什么是当前多数科学家和教师最应当努力的方向。当然，作为科学家和教师，应当在业务上专而又专，我国现在科学水平还不高，应当努力赶上世界先进科学水平。但是当资产阶级知识分子在政治方向上发生动摇的时候，就应当首先着重解决政治方向的问题。对许多专而未红或红得不够的科学家和教师来说，就应当更加努力来解决“红”的问题。怎样才能“专”得更好、更快、更深呢？只有把科学事业放在党的领导之下，把科学研究工作和教育事业放到社会主义建设事业的总轨道上来，放在马克思主义的思想指导之下，把个人放在集体之中，把知识分子放到工人农民劳动群众之中。只有这样才能又好又快又多地培养出工人阶级的红色专家，才能把理论和实践更密切联系起来，而迅速提高科学和教学的水平。但要把科学和教育事业放在党的领导之下，放到社会主义的轨道上来，就需要有科学家的自觉。没有这种自觉，是不可能做到的。现在没有人公开来反对知识分子要思想改造，但是对于思想改造的自觉程度显然还是不平衡的。有些人也许以为只要不反党反社会主义就可以了，只要跟着党就可以了；有些人也许以为在政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利之后，在打退右派的进攻之后，就只有埋头钻研业务的问题，而不必再继续强调政治思想问题了。他们不了解，政治思想斗争并没有结束；政治在今天和将来始终都是经济、技术、科学的统帅。从全国范围来说，政治、思想上的社会主义革命是取得了基本的胜利，但对每一个人来讲，却还要进行持久的努力，以过好社会主义这一关。科学家们决心做左派、成为又红又专更红更专的倡议和规划，正是表现了他们这种自我改造的要求，抓住了问题的关键所在。
    提出倡议和规划的科学家们，并不是表示他们现在在政治上都还不是左派，但从他们所提出的具体要求来看，那么，即使现在已经是左派的科学家，也还可以再继续努力，这就是不断地又红又专更红更专的道理。
    我们欢迎这些倡议和规划，希望经过这些规划的制订和执行，促成一个科学家、知识分子的自我思想改造的运动。只有经过这一运动，才能更好更快地促进社会主义科学事业和教育事业的发展。我们希望上海的所有的科学家都决心做左派，响应他们的倡议——“人人争取、各自规划、平时互助、年终评比、步步向左、力求红透”，争取做一个又红又专的科学家！
