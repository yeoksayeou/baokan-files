The CCP Nanchang Prefectural Committee, in order to promote the winter large-scale production movement, implemented an important leadership method—a comprehensive appraisal and inspection system. More than 10,000 cadres and 1.8 million farmers participated in the appraisal and inspection work. The entire area selected three types of representative regions—advanced, intermediate, and backward—organized on-site visits, mutual comparisons, and mutual learning. During the visits, based on the content of winter production, "Four Comparisons" (comparing quantity, quality, labor attendance, and leadership methods) and "Eight Checks" (checking water conservancy construction, checking manure accumulation and fertilizer production, checking winter crop cultivation and management, checking winter plowing to eliminate pests, checking the preparation of rice paddies, seeds, farm tools, and draught cattle, checking afforestation and sideline production, checking the distribution and management of agricultural cooperatives, and checking the work style of cadres' leadership) were conducted. This kind of appraisal and inspection effectively promoted the in-depth development of the winter production movement; both the masses and the cadres received education at the same time.

In mid-January, under the leadership of the person in charge of the prefectural committee, a large-scale appraisal and inspection was carried out throughout the area. The seventeen counties of the entire prefecture were divided into four groups for appraisal. Fengcheng, Nanchang, Jinxian, Qingjiang, and Xinyu counties formed one group, led by Li Yu, the secretary of the prefectural committee, and consisting of the first secretaries of the county party committees, county heads, rural work ministers, and leading cadres of good, medium, and poor townships and cooperatives. On January 6th, the visiting group first went to Tangwei Township in Fengcheng County, which had outstanding achievements in winter production. This township seemed to have entered a boiling spring plowing season. Under the leadership of twelve township cadres, 100% of the male labor force and 98% of the female labor force in the township were mobilized to participate in winter production activities. All of the township's more than 22,000 mu of farmland had been planted with spring-harvest crops, which were growing lush and green; the ridges of the fields were gleaming; 304 water conservancy projects had been built, nearly four times the original plan; and the amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu reached 80 dan, more than twice as much as last year. The visitors were inspired by witnessing the tremendous production enthusiasm of the farmers in Tangwei Township. Many people compared the situation in their own townships and cooperatives with Tangwei Township and felt that they must catch up quickly. Next, the visiting group went to Chunntan and Daqiao Townships in Qingjiang County, which were adjacent to Tangwei Township. The farmers' production enthusiasm in these two townships was not tense enough, only 60% of the labor force attended production, spring-harvest crops were not growing well, and water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation were not done very well. When the visiting group stepped into Luofang Township in Xinyu County, they found that this township had no movement in production. The township leaders let things go, and the masses thought that "winter production should be the same every year," and few people participated in fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction, and about half of the land was not planted with winter crops.

After the visits and inspections, the contrast between the advanced, intermediate, and backward areas became more distinct, which greatly inspired the cadres from all over the visiting group. Xing Haichuan, the secretary of the Jinxian County Party Committee, said after the visit: "I originally thought that the production movement in our county was doing well, with more than 20 dan of fertilizer per mu, 38% of water conservancy completed, and good spring seedlings. Now it seems that it is far behind Tangwei Township, and we still need to overcome the complacency of some grassroots cadres and further push the winter production movement to a climax." Only half a month after the visit, the winter production movement in Jinxian County achieved further development, with 52 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu and water conservancy construction overfulfilling the plan by 136%. At the same time, Wang Cheng, the secretary of the Qingjiang County Party Committee, who visited, saw the advanced examples of Tangwei Township in Fengcheng County and the insufficiently tense production situation in the two townships in his county. He immediately felt ashamed and immediately called the county party committee to notify a county-wide cadre meeting. On January 10th, a production mobilization was carried out at a meeting of more than 500 cadres in the county, and the slogan "Fight hard for forty days to catch up with and exceed the work progress of Fengcheng" was put forward. After the cadres returned to their townships, the production movement in the county unfolded like a landslide, and many hero competition groups emerged in every township and cooperative. Song Mosheng and other four laborers from the Xiaoyang Cooperative in Jinglou Township formed a hero group for repairing water conservancy and carrying earth, creating a new record of carrying 32 cubic meters of earth per person per day, which was more than twice as fast as the general labor efficiency. Another hero group for accumulating fertilizer was formed by Bai Chongxian and other four laborers, who dug 1,000 dan of pond mud per person per day. Chunntan Township immediately corrected the situation of insufficient production tension, and the labor attendance rate surged to 95% within three days, and a four-mu-one-cellar fertilizer accumulation movement was launched. Qingjiang County quickly changed its backward state, and within fifteen days, the amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu increased from 17 dan to 36.2 dan. The water conservancy task completed 3 million cubic meters of earthwork, and the speed was doubled. The farmers in Tangwei Township in Fengcheng County saw Chunntan Township in Qingjiang County catching up, and their labor enthusiasm was even greater, determined to work hard and strive for greater achievements.

In the area of ​​the four counties of Pingxiang, Yichun, Wanzai, and Fenyi that were compared, after the prefectural committee's inspection and appraisal call was issued, each county adopted many measures to promote winter production. The visiting group visited the advanced, intermediate, and backward eleven townships bordering the counties, and then concentrated on joint evaluation, carried out "county-to-county comparison," "ace-to-ace comparison," and "general-to-general comparison," comparing labor attendance and labor efficiency, comparing production quantity and quality, and comparing leadership style. During the appraisal, what was particularly noticeable was that Tongmu Township in Pingxiang County alone completed 500,000 cubic meters of water conservancy earthwork, with an average standard fertilizer per mu reaching 90 dan, while Fenyi County only completed 420,000 cubic meters, with an average fertilizer of about 32 dan per mu. Under the sharp contrast, Fenyi County quickly checked the main reasons why the winter production movement had not been carried out well, and believed that it was because the work of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation was not grasped tightly, the arrangements were improper, and the enthusiasm was not great. Then, the county quickly took measures, such as the "three types of cooperatives" Shui Bei Cooperative organized the masses to take comprehensive action on the first day after the inspection.

In Nanchang County, the county-level organization has organized three county-wide inspections in the past two months, and the townships and cooperatives generally carried out five to six appraisals and inspections. A tense labor competition climax has formed in every place in the county. On January 22nd, in the snowy weather, 160,000 people, accounting for 80% of the total labor force in the county, braved the snow and ice to repair water conservancy and accumulate fertilizer. Gaoan and Fengxin counties launched a "Hundred Red Flags" competition movement, and the determination of many agricultural cooperatives was: "Thousands of people and tens of thousands of people are of one mind, and every heart is for a yield of one thousand catties per mu." The ambition of the broad masses of members of the Xin Jian County to strive for advancement is: "Those who have won the red flag must let the red flag take root, and those who have not won the red flag must let the red flag grow legs."

The appraisal and inspection work in Nanchang Prefecture promoted a comprehensive production upsurge. The original 32% of the backward areas have caught up, and a production upsurge has been set off in the entire area. The prefectural committee decided that the prefectural-wide appraisal and inspection will be carried out once or twice every quarter in the future, once a month in each county, and once every seven days to half a month in each township and cooperative. The prefectural committee believes that this effective and successful working method must be adhered to regularly and run through the whole year.

    用评比方法推进生产
    中共南昌地委为了促进冬季大生产运动，实行了一项重要的领导方法——全面的评比检查制度。参加评比检查工作的有一万多名干部和一百八十多万农民。全区选择了先进、中间、落后三种有代表性的地区，组织实地参观，互相比较，互相学习。在参观学习中，根据冬季生产的内容，进行“四比”（比数量、比质量、比劳动出勤、比领导方法），“八查”（查兴修水利，查积肥造肥，查冬作物培育管理，查冬耕灭虫，查秧田、种子、农具、耕牛的准备，查造林、副业生产，查农业社的分配管理，查干部领导作风）。这样评比检查，有力地推动了冬季生产运动的深入发展；群众和干部同时受到了教育。
    1月中旬，在地委负责人的主持下，全区范围内进行大规模的评比检查。全专区十七个县分四个片进行评比。丰城、南昌、进贤、清江、新余等五县为一片，由地委书记李玉带队，由这五个县的县委第一书记、县长、农村工作部长和好、中、差三种乡、社的领导干部组成参观团进行参观。1月6日，参观团首先到丰城县冬季生产成绩优异的塘圩乡。这个乡好像进入了沸腾的春耕季节，在十二个乡干部的带头下，全乡100％的男劳动力和98％的女劳动力都出动参加冬季生产活动。全乡二万二千多亩田地已经全部种上了春收作物，生长得一片葱绿；田堪田塍刨的闪光；水利工程修好了三百零四处，将近原计划的四倍；积肥每亩达到八十担，比去年多二倍多。参观的人亲眼看到塘圩乡农民这种巨大的生产劲头，都受到了鼓舞。许多人拿自己乡、社的情况和塘圩乡比较，觉得必须快马加鞭赶上来。接着，参观团到与塘圩乡毗邻的清江县椿潭、大桥两乡。这两个乡农民的生产情绪不够紧张，只有60％的劳动力出勤生产，春收作物生长不好，水利积肥都搞得不太多。当参观团踏进新余县罗坊乡以后，发现这个乡在生产方面还无动静。乡的领导放任自流，群众认为“冬季生产，年年都应该一样”，积肥、修水利很少有人参加，半数左右的田土没有种上冬季作物。
    经过参观检查，先进、中间、落后三类地区的对比更加鲜明，使参观团中各地的干部都有了很大的启发。进贤县县委书记邢海川在参观后说：“原先认为本县的生产运动搞得不错，每亩有肥料二十多担，水利完成了38％，春苗生长也好。现在看来，要与塘圩乡比较还差得很远，还需要克服某些基层干部的自满情绪，进一步把冬季生产运动推向高潮。”参观后只有半个多月的时间，进贤县的冬季生产运动获得了进一步的发展，每亩积肥五十二担，兴修水利超额完成计划的136％。同时参观的清江县县委书记王诚，看到丰城县塘圩乡的先进事例和本县两个乡生产不够紧张的状况，当时就感到惭愧，马上摇电话给县委通知开全县干部大会。1月10日那天，在全县五百多名干部大会上进行了生产大动员，提出了“苦战四十天，赶上和超过丰城工作进度”的口号。干部分别回乡后，全县生产运动就像排山倒海似的开展起来了，乡乡社社都踊现了许许多多的英雄竞赛组。经楼乡小阳社社员宋模生等四个劳动力组成为一个修水利挑土方的英雄组，创造了每人每天挑土三十二方的新纪录，比一般劳动工效快一倍以上。另又由社员白崇贤等四个劳动力组成了一个积肥英雄组，每人每天挖积塘泥一千担。椿潭乡立即纠正了生产不紧张的情况，三天之内劳动力出勤率激增至95％，开展了四亩一窖的积肥运动。清江县很快就改变了落后状态，十五天时间内，每亩积肥由十七担增至三十六点二担。水利任务完成三百万土方，速度加快了两倍。丰城县塘圩乡的农民看到清江县椿潭乡迎头直追，劳动劲头更大，决心苦干，争取更大的成绩。
    在评比的萍乡、宜春、万载、分宜等四个县的一片中，地委的检查评比号召发出后，各县都采取了许多推动冬季生产的措施。参观团实地参观了先进的、中间的、落后的县与县交界的十一个乡，然后集中联评，进行了“县与县比”、“王牌与王牌比”、“一般与一般比”，比劳动出勤率和劳动效率，比生产数量与质量，比领导作风。评比的时候，特别引人注意的是：萍乡县桐木乡一个乡就完成了水利土方五十万方，每亩平均标准肥达九十担，而分宜一个县还只完成四十二万方，每亩平均约有肥料三十二担。在鲜明的对照下，分宜县很快检查了冬季生产运动没有很好地开展的主要原因，认为是对水利、积肥等项工作抓得不紧，安排不当，干劲不大。接着全县迅速采取了措施，如“三类社”水北社在检查后的第一天，就组织群众全面行动起来。
    在南昌县，两个月来县一级组织了三次全县性的大检查，乡、社一般开展五到六次的评比检查。全县每一个地方都形成了紧张的劳动竞赛高潮。在1月22日飘着大雪的天气中，全县占总劳动力80％的十六万人，冒雪破冰修水利积肥。高安、奉新等两县开展了“百面红旗”竞赛运动，许多农业社的决心是：“千人万人一条心，条条心为了亩产一千斤”。新建县的广大社员争取先进的雄心是：“得上了红旗的要红旗生根，未得红旗的要红旗长脚”。
    南昌专区的评比检查工作推进了全面性的生产高潮。原先有32％的落后地区已经迎头赶上来了，全区掀起了生产高潮。地委决定全专区性的评比检查今后每一季度进行一至二次，各县一个月一次，乡社每七天到半月一次。地委认为这一行之有效的成功的工作方法必须经常坚持下去，贯穿全年。
