Tongcheng Middle School Practices Diligence and Thrift in Running the School, Combining Work and Study; Production Teams Directly Linked to Classes

    (Our report) Tongcheng County Junior Middle School in Anhui Province educates students to love labor and combine work and study, so that students naturally combine studying and labor. Students regard studying well, working well, knowing how to farm, and knowing how to work as honorable. The school's appearance has undergone significant changes. The school has fourteen classes with eight hundred and one students. The school is located in the western suburbs of the county seat, adjacent to the Wenchang Agricultural Cooperative Farm. The school buildings are simple and crude, the dormitories use civilian houses, the dining hall is a thatched house, and the conference room is also the laboratory. In such a simple school, students study and work, full of vigor.

    The school has many methods for conducting labor education and combining work and study for students. One of the main methods is to link up with the Wenchang Agricultural Cooperative and establish a fixed connection, with students participating in the cooperative's labor. Their method is to study the cooperative's production situation and the students' ability to participate in labor through the connection between the school and the agricultural cooperative, so that the agricultural cooperative's production team is directly linked to the school's study class. Then, the class and team leaders specifically organize labor production and include the production labor plan in the school and agricultural cooperative's planning. This ensures that students have regular labor opportunities and combines study and labor well. After establishing this connection, the teachers and students gave the agricultural cooperative four major supports: First, in addition to participating in the cooperative's production labor on time, the students also helped the agricultural cooperative in rushing to harvest, rushing to plant, and fighting drought, providing great labor support to the cooperative. Second, last year, the cooperative needed fertilizer to plant double-cropping rice, and the teachers and students accumulated and delivered a large amount of fertilizer to the agricultural cooperative. Last semester, the entire school supported the agricultural cooperative with more than two thousand dan of fertilizer. Third, the students brought culture to the agricultural cooperative. Every time they went to the agricultural cooperative for production, they brought fertilizer or character blocks. While carrying out literacy work, they also compiled two literacy textbooks for the agricultural cooperative members, made eight hundred character blocks, copied textbooks for the cooperative members in their spare time, taught classes, taught singing, and held joint performances with the cooperative members, bringing cultural and recreational activities to the cooperative. Fourth, last spring, the agricultural cooperative had financial difficulties, and teachers and staff invested 741 yuan. The fact that this agricultural cooperative leaped from a yield of more than 700 jin per mu to more than 1,000 jin per mu last year and became a "thousand-jin cooperative" is inseparable from the school's encouragement and support. Because the agricultural cooperative received help from the school, the cooperative members also helped the school in every way. For example, when the school wanted to build a recreation room but had no foundation, the agricultural cooperative helped them solve the foundation problem. When there was no straw for building the school, the cooperative first sold the straw to them, and the vegetables grown by the cooperative members were all the best for them to eat. The teachers and students get along with the agricultural cooperative like a family. When students returned home during winter and summer vacations, they also actively participated in agricultural production, gradually forming a good atmosphere of diligence and thrift in combining work and study. In addition to laboring during winter and summer vacations and helping the agricultural cooperative with labor, the students also raised more than 40 pigs on campus and transported rice and built roads themselves. In the first half of 1957, they transported more than 30,000 jin of rice and grass, built six roads, planted more than 2,000 trees, planted more than 4,000 sunflower and castor plants, and harvested more than 5,000 jin of pumpkins. Some of the school classrooms' walls were painted by teachers and students themselves. They reduced the state's financial expenditure through their own labor. They used the income from labor to improve welfare and hygiene, subsidize collective meals, and subsidize students with difficulties. They also plan to buy sewing machines, hair clippers, and other things to serve the teachers and students. Through the above methods, this school has truly achieved diligence and thrift in running the school and combining work and study.

    Because students personally participated in physical labor, it is easier to connect with reality in learning, understanding ability is improved, and the effect of learning is greater; and the cultivation of character is also very good. For example, when learning chemistry, they connected it with why the agricultural cooperative used salt water to select seeds to learn about "solution concentration"; when learning phosphates, sulfuric acid, etc., they connected it with learning the principles of manufacturing chemical fertilizers and pesticides; when learning geometry, they connected it with learning on-site measurement, instrument use, and drawing charts. With the help of the agricultural cooperative and the farm, combined with their own personal experience, they learned a lot of practical knowledge, such as the director of the cooperative explaining the superiority of cooperation to the students; the farm technicians explaining livestock management, wheat selection, soil fertility and improvement of the Wenchang Cooperative, etc., and the agricultural cooperative accountant explaining agricultural cooperative management, so that most students understood how to make agricultural cooperative plans, how to record work points, etc. Because the students participated in actual production, and the people who lectured had practical experience, the lectures were vivid and specific, and the students' understanding was also very deep. When teaching language, geography, current affairs, and policies, the school connected it with the students' participation in labor, seeing the superiority of the agricultural cooperative with their own eyes, etc., to conduct education on loving labor, loving the motherland, and loving the socialist new countryside, which greatly improved the students' ideological awareness.

    桐城中学勤俭办学勤工俭学
    生产队和班级直接挂上了钩
    本报讯　安徽省桐城县初级中学，对学生进行热爱劳动和勤工俭学的教育，使学生把读书和劳动自然地结合起来，学生们都以学习好、劳动好、会种地、会做工为光荣。学校面貌起了显著变化。这个学校共有十四个班八百零一人，校址在县城的西郊，和文昌农业社农场毗邻。校舍因陋就简，宿舍利用民房，饭厅是草屋，会议室又是实验室。在这样简陋的学校里，学生们一面读书一面劳动，生气蓬勃。
    这个学校对学生进行劳动教育和勤工俭学的办法很多，其中主要一个办法，就是和文昌农业社挂钩，建立了固定联系，学生们参加社里的劳动。他们的办法是，通过学校和农业社的联系，研究社里的生产情况和学生能够参加劳动的情况，使农业社生产队和学校的学习班直接挂钩，然后由班、队负责人，具体组织劳动生产，把生产劳动计划列入学校和农业社规划，这就保证了学生有经常的劳动机会，把学习和劳动很好地结合起来。经过这样建立联系以后，教师、学生们给了农业社四大支援：一、学生们除了按时参加社的生产劳动，还在抢收、抢种、抗旱中帮助农业社突击生产，在劳动力上给了社里很大支援；二、去年社里种双季稻需要肥料，师生大量积肥送肥给农业社，上一学期全校支援了农业社二千多担肥料；三、学生们把文化送上农业社，他们每次到农业社生产时，不是带着肥料，就是带着字块，一面进行扫盲工作，一面就为农业社员编了两本识字课本，制了八百个字块，利用课余为社员抄课本，上课，教唱歌，和社员联欢演剧，把文化娱乐活动带到社里；四、去年春天农业社资金困难，教员职工投资达七百四十一元。这个农业社去年由每亩产量七百多斤一跃而为一千多斤，成为千斤社，是和这个学校的鼓舞和支援分不开的。农业社因为受到了学校的帮助，社员们也处处帮助学校。如学校要修建游艺室没有地基，农业社就帮助他们解决了地基问题；修建校舍没有稻草，社里就尽先把稻草卖给他们，社员种的蔬菜都挑最好的给他们吃。师生们和农业社相处得像是一家人。学生在寒暑假回家时也积极参加了农业生产，逐渐形成了勤工俭学的风气。学生除了寒暑假劳动，平时在农业社帮助农业社劳动外，在校内还养猪四十多头，自己运米、筑路。他们在1957年上半年运米、运草达三万多斤，筑路六条；栽树二千多棵，种葵花、蓖麻四千多棵，种南瓜的收获达五千多斤；学校教室的墙壁，有的都由师生自己粉刷。他们利用自己的劳动，减少了国家经费开支。用劳动所得，改善了福利卫生，补助了集体伙食，对有困难的同学还进行了补助。他们还计划要买缝纫机、理发刀剪等，为师生服务。这个学校通过以上种种办法真正作到了勤俭办学和勤工俭学。
    因为学生亲自参加了体力劳动，所以在学习上便容易联系实际，理解能力提高，学习的效果也更大；而在品质方面的锻炼也很好。如在学化学时，便联系农业社为什么要用盐水选种来学习“溶液浓度”；在学磷酸盐、硫酸等时便联系学习了制造化学肥料和杀虫药剂的原理；学几何时便联系学习了实地测量、仪器使用、绘制图表。他们借助农业社和农场的帮助，结合自己的亲身体验，更学了不少实际知识，如社主任给学生讲合作化的优越性；农场技术员给学生讲牲畜管理、小麦选种、文昌社的土壤肥力和改良等，农业社会计给学生讲农业社经营管理，使大部分学生懂得如何订农业社计划，如何记工分等。因为学生参加了实际生产，讲的人又有实际经验，所以讲得生动具体，学生领会也很深刻。学校在教语文课、地理、时事政策时，都联系了学生参加劳动后，亲眼看到农业社的优越性等等，进行热爱劳动、热爱祖国、热爱社会主义新农村的教育，使学生们的思想觉悟大大提高。
