    Why Can Vinegar Alleviate Alcohol Intoxication?
    Why is it that if a drunk person drinks some vinegar, they can gradually sober up?
    The reason why alcohol makes people drunk is because it contains alcohol. The main component of vinegar is acetic acid. When alcohol and acetic acid meet, a chemical reaction occurs, producing a substance called ethyl acetate, and both the alcohol and acetic acid lose their original properties. Since the alcohol has been transformed into a new substance, losing its intoxicating properties, the drunk person will also sober up. (He Kun)

    为什么醋能解酒醉？
    为什么喝醉酒的人，如果喝一些醋就能够逐渐清醒过来？
    酒所以能使人醉，是因为里面含有酒精。醋的主要成分是醋酸。酒精和醋酸相遇，便发生化学变化，产生一种叫作醋酸乙酯的东西，而酒精和醋酸都失去了原来的特性。既然酒精已被变成另外一种新的东西，失掉了它醉人的特性，喝醉了的人也就清醒过来了。（何坤）
