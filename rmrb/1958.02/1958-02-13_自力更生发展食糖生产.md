Representative Wu Hongbin says that Gansu is suitable for growing sugar beets. Establishing small-scale processing plants requires little investment, yields high returns, utilizes economical equipment, employs simple methods, and is most suitable for promotion in rural areas.

I fully agree with the reports by Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice-Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice-Premier Bo Yibo. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the development of sugar production in Gansu Province.

The sugar needed by our Gansu Province has always been transported from distant Guangdong, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, and other places. In recent years, with the gradual improvement of people's lives, the demand for sugar has been increasing, while the national sugar supply is relatively tight. Therefore, the supply of sugar in Gansu often falls short of demand, and sugar shortages constantly appear in Lanzhou. How can this problem be solved? There are only two ways: one is to ask the state for more; the other is to develop sugar production through self-reliance. Obviously, we should adopt the latter method.

It is not without basis to say that sugar production can be developed in the Gansu area. First of all, Gansu has great potential in agricultural production. In addition to focusing on the development of grain and cotton, it can also develop other cash crops, including sugar beets for sugar production. Secondly, the soil in Gansu is slightly alkaline, the climate is continental, the temperature difference between day and night is large, the sunshine duration is long, the frost-free period averages 150 days, and crops mainly rely on irrigation. These conditions are most suitable for the growth of sugar beets, and can reduce pests and diseases. According to materials from the Zhangye area, the average yield of sugar beets per mu is 6,000 jin, and the highest can reach 10,000 jin. The sugar extraction rate is very high, averaging more than 18 percent. Third, many places in Gansu, especially the Zhangye area, have a history of more than ten years of growing sugar beets and making sugar using indigenous methods, and have accumulated a lot of valuable experience. Therefore, it is entirely possible to develop sugar beet production in Gansu.

Here, I would like to introduce the experience of the Wuwei joint state-private sugar beet processing plant. The entire production process of this plant is operated manually, the method is simple, and the total equipment costs only more than 5,000 yuan. It has 18 employees, in addition to two permanent employees, the rest are temporary workers. After starting operation in 1956, within 124 days, it used 370,000 jin of sugar beets as raw materials, and produced more than 45,000 jin of brown sugar and white sugar. The cost was only 13,000 yuan, the profit was 3,300 yuan, and the tax paid was more than 8,900 yuan. That is to say, in one production period, the state's income is equal to two and a half times the investment. If the raw materials are sufficient, and production is carried out in three shifts, the state's income will be even greater. Sugar beet leaves, beet tops, and waste silk can be used as feed, and filter mud can be used as fertilizer. After the Urban Services Department sent a working group to summarize the experience of this plant, it was considered to be of great value for promotion. Small-scale processing plants like this, with low investment, high returns, economical equipment, and simple methods, are very suitable for promotion in rural areas, where sugar can be made while growing sugar beets.

Now, we are preparing to develop 2 million mu of sugar beets during the second five-year plan. Calculated on the basis of an average yield of 6,000 jin per mu and a sugar extraction rate of 18 percent, by 1962, the province can produce 840,000 tons of sugar annually, and 270,000 tons of molasses can be used to brew 98,000 tons of wine. The value of sugar production alone can reach about 800 million yuan each year. Sugar beet leaves, beet tops, and waste silk can feed more than 3 million cattle or more than 4 million pigs each year. In this way, Gansu's sugar can not only be self-sufficient, but also supply other places; it can not only increase national income, but also promote the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. There are many benefits.

Of course, it is not easy to develop 2 million mu of sugar beets and produce 840,000 tons of sugar in five years. Therefore, we must show revolutionary vigor, overcome difficulties, and forge ahead, so that Gansu's sugar production, like other undertakings, can achieve an unprecedented great leap forward.

### 自力更生发展食糖生产

    自力更生发展食糖生产
    吴鸿宾代表说甘肃适宜甜菜生长。建立小型加工厂，投资少，收益大，设备经济，方法简单，最适宜在农村推广。
    我完全同意彭真副委员长、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理的报告。现在，我就在甘肃省发展食糖生产的问题，发表一点意见。
    我们甘肃省需要的食糖，一向是从很远的广东、四川、黑龙江等地运来的。几年以来，随着人民生活的逐步改善，食糖的需要量也不断增加，而全国的食糖供应又是比较紧张，因此，甘肃的食糖往往供不应求，兰州市也不断出现食糖脱销的现象。这个问题怎样解决呢？办法只有两个：一个是向国家再多要一些；一个是自力更生，发展食糖生产。显然，我们应该采取后一种办法。
    在甘肃地区可以发展食糖生产，并不是没有根据的。首先，甘肃的农业生产潜力很大，除了主要发展粮食和棉花以外，还可以发展其他经济作物，包括制糖的原料甜菜。其次，甘肃的土壤带有轻微的碱性，气候属于大陆性，昼夜温度相差大，日照时间长，无霜期平均一百五十天，作物主要靠引水灌溉。这些条件最适宜于甜菜的成长，而且可以减轻病虫害，根据张掖专区的材料，每亩甜菜的平均产量为六千斤，最高的可以达到一万斤，出糖率很高，平均在百分之十八以上。第三，甘肃不少地方，特别是张掖专区，群众种植甜菜和用土法制糖，已经有十几年的历史，积累了不少宝贵的经验。因此，在甘肃发展甜菜制糖，是完全可能的。
    这里，我想介绍一下武威公私合营甜菜加工厂的经验。这个厂子的整个生产过程都用人力操作，方法简便，全部设备只有五千多元。职工十八人，除了两个固定职工以外，其余都是临时工。一九五六年开工以后，在一百二十四天内，用三十七万斤甜菜做原料，制成了红糖和白糖四万五千多斤。成本只有一万三千元，利润就有三千三百多元，还交纳税款八千九百多元。这就是说，在一个生产期，国家收入等于投资额的两倍半。如果原料充足，分三班生产，国家收入将更多。甜菜叶、青头、废丝可以做饲料，滤泥可以做肥料。这个厂子的经验，经过城市服务部派工作组总结以后，认为很有推广的价值。像这样投资少，收益大，设备经济，方法简单的小型加工厂，很适宜于在农村推行，一面种植甜菜，一面就可以制糖。
    现在，我们准备在第二个五年计划期间发展甜菜二百万亩。按每亩平均产量六千斤，出糖率为百分之十八计算，到一九六二年，全省可以年产食糖八十四万吨，糖蜜二十七万吨可以酿酒九万八千吨。每年单是食糖的产值就可以达到八亿元左右。甜菜叶、青头、废丝每年可以喂牛三百多万头，或者喂猪四百多万口。这样，甘肃的食糖不仅可以自给，而且可以供应外地；不仅可以增加国家收入，而且可以促进农业和畜牧业的发展。好处是多方面的。
    当然，要在五年内发展二百万亩甜菜，生产八十四万吨糖，这不是轻而易举的。因此，我们一定要拿出革命的干劲，克服困难，勇往直前，使甘肃的食糖生产，也像其他各项事业一样，得到一个前所未有的大跃进。
