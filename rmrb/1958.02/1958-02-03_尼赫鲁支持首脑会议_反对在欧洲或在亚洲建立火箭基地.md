Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 2nd: According to the "Neues Deutschland" published on February 1st, Indian Prime Minister Nehru told reporters from the newspaper that holding a summit meeting could bring "new vitality" to solving the disarmament issue.

He also said that it would be beneficial to prepare for such a meeting "through informal negotiations."

Nehru emphasized that for the sake of peace, the most important thing at present is for the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement. He said that, generally speaking, it is better to have specific agreements than general guarantees of peace. He believes that the agreement reached between the Soviet Union and the United States on cultural exchanges is a "good start." He hopes that the two countries can reach agreements on other issues.

When talking about the German issue, Prime Minister Nehru emphasized that German unification should be achieved on the basis of strengthening European security, rather than increasing the threat to peace. Nehru believes that the refusal of atomic weapons and rocket weapons by the two Germanys, and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, can promote the peaceful unification of Germany.

Nehru said that he opposes the establishment of rocket bases in Europe or Asia. He advocates establishing areas without weapons of mass destruction. He said that the larger the area and the greater the number of such areas, the better it would be for the world.

Nehru emphasized that reaching an agreement on the establishment of such areas would help achieve general mutual understanding, including mutual understanding between the two Germanys. If the tension between the two Germanys can be eased as a result and eventually eliminated, then further steps can be taken to seek reunification, such as the establishment of an alliance between the two Germanys.

　　尼赫鲁支持首脑会议
    反对在欧洲或在亚洲建立火箭基地
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社柏林1日讯：“新德意志报”2月1日刊载印度总理尼赫鲁对这家报纸记者发表的谈话说，举行最高级会议可以为解决裁军问题带来“新的活力”。
    他还说，“通过非正式谈判”来筹备这种会议，是有好处的。
    尼赫鲁强调指出，为了和平，目前最重要的是美苏两国达成协议。他说，一般说来，宁可要具体的协议，而不要一般性的和平保证。他认为苏美两国就文化交流问题达成协定是一个“良好的开端”。他希望这两个国家能够就其他问题达成协议。
    尼赫鲁总理在谈到德国问题时强调指出，应该在加强欧洲安全、而不是增加对和平的威胁的基础上求得德国的统一。尼赫鲁认为，两个德国拒绝原子武器和火箭武器以及在中欧建立无原子武器地区的做法，能够促进德国的和平统一。
    尼赫鲁说，他反对在欧洲或者在亚洲建立火箭基地。他主张建立没有大规模毁灭性武器的地区。他说，这种地区的面积越大，数量越多，对世界越有好处。
    尼赫鲁强调指出，达成关于建立这种地区的协定有助于取得普遍的相互谅解，其中包括两个德国的相互谅解。如果两个德国之间的紧张局势能因此而得到缓和，最后能够消除，那就可以进一步采取其他谋求恢复统一的步骤，例如，建立两个德国的联盟。
