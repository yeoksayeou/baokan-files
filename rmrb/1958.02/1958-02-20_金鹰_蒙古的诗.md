    Golden Eagle – A Mongolian Poem
    Qiuyang
    On the capital's stage, "Golden Eagle" is the first play to reflect the lives and struggles of the Mongolian people. Young writer Chao Ketu Naren has demonstrated his valuable enthusiasm in this play.
    Living in our generation, happiness is all around us, and it is often difficult to imagine the enormous price that our predecessors (especially our fraternal nationalities) paid in the dark years of the past in order to fight for a more reasonable situation, or even a beautiful aspiration. A friend who is somewhat familiar with the old Mongolian life once recounted that in the past, in the era when "the words of the prince were law," the deified authority of the prince brought untold disasters and humiliations to the herders. Super-economic exploitation and inhuman treatment painted the beautiful grasslands with dark colors, the horse-head fiddle played mournful tunes all year round, and the kind but unfortunate herders placed their hopes on the Buddha in the dark. However, aspirations grew with disasters, and even a cry of resistance would stir countless resonances; even a little bit of brave behavior would be widely spread. In this resonance and spread, the people's wishes were determined, the deeds of resistance were enriched, and at the same time, the initial resister would inevitably be greatly encouraged to make even braver actions for the benefit of the people.
    The emergence and development of the heroic deeds of the Golden Eagle – Burgude – has such prominent features: his initial resistance to the prince, although stemming from a protest against an unjust judgment, won him great respect because he was resisting the prince, whom everyone hated but revered as a god. His deeds were praised in several tribes, becoming a symbol of light and courage, and he himself finally did something even braver: assassinating the prince, leaving people with eternal remembrance and encouragement. Therefore, this work is not so much about writing about a hero, but rather about writing about how strongly the unyielding Mongolian people yearn for heroic acts of resistance!
    Not content with general praise, but striving to portray many complex characters, so as to highlight the objective basis for producing heroes like the Golden Eagle, the so-called public opinion is also a prominent feature of this play. It seems that several old people who are all princes and obedient people have quite simple characters: Ansile, who hides the pain of losing his son, still bravely releases Burgude at a critical moment despite still carrying out the prince's orders; the old silversmith Xiri, the embodiment of cleverness and wisdom, still smiles and blesses the departing Burgude even though he has been poisoned; Shandanmu, who believes in the truth of "wolves eating sheep is pitiful, hunters killing wolves is also pitiful," is also willing to let Burgude go; the young Chaganhu sacrificed his most beautiful feelings for the happiness of Burgude and Shandan; and many other people who did not appear often...all of these contributed to Burgude's growth, and also more specifically showed how much admirable and noble sentiments the kind Mongolian people have!
    The vast background, the great emotional conflicts, the bright colors, and many beautiful dialogues give this play a poetic style.
    The performance basically embodies the spirit of the original work, and the young actors' abundant enthusiasm is conducive to the transmission of poetry. If the objective environment in which the event occurred could be portrayed more concentratedly in the performance processing, and the inner hearts of those quite simple characters could be excavated more carefully, it would naturally be even better.
    Like all new creations, the script is not without its shortcomings. The reason why I don't talk much about it here is because I feel that, like "Golden Eagle," through a historical heroic story, the common unyielding character of a nation is embodied, although perhaps not completely, the results of this effort should still be affirmed in the main aspects.

    金鹰——蒙古的诗
    丘扬
    在首都的舞台上，反映蒙族人民生活斗争的剧作，“金鹰”还是第一个，青年作家超克图纳仁同志在这部戏里，显示了他可贵的热情。
    生活在我们这一代的人，幸福就在周围，往往难于想像处在过去黑暗岁月中的前人（特别是兄弟民族）为了争取一个较为合理的处境、甚至一个美丽的向往，曾付出多么巨大的代价。一位多少熟悉一些旧日蒙古生活的朋友，曾经讲起，在过去“王爷的话说出口就是法律”的年代里，神化了的王爷的权威不知带给牧民以多少灾难和屈辱，超经济的剥削、非人的待遇，使得美丽的草原涂上阴暗的色彩，马头琴终年奏着哀怨的调子，善良而不幸的牧民寄希望于冥冥中的佛。然而，向往也与灾难俱增，那怕有一声反抗的呼喊，也会激起无数的共鸣；有一点勇敢的行为，也会得到广泛的流传；就在这共鸣和流传中，注定了人民的愿望，丰富了反抗的事迹，同时，也必然会大大地鼓励了那个最初的反抗者，使他愿为人民的利益做出更大的勇敢行为。
    金鹰——布尔固德的英雄行为的产生和发展，就是有着这样显著的特色：他对王爷最初的反抗，虽然出自对一件不公正的判决的抗议，然而由于他反抗的是人人痛恨但又奉之若神的王爷，因之这反抗本身便博得了人们莫大的尊敬，他的事迹在几个部落中讴歌着，成为光明和勇敢的象征，他自己也终于做出更勇敢的事情刺杀了王爷，留给人们以永远的追念和鼓舞。因之，这部作品与其说是写出了一个英雄，不如说写出了不屈的蒙古人民对于勇于反抗的英雄行为有着多么强烈的向往！
    不满足于一般的歌颂，努力地去刻划许多复杂的人物性格，借以突现足以产生像金鹰这样英雄的客观基础，所谓公道自在人心也是这部戏的显著特点。看来同是王公顺民的几个老年人，都有着颇不简单的性格：隐藏着丧子的痛楚的安思乐，尽管依然执行王爷的命令，却在重要关头勇敢地放走了布尔固德；聪明和智慧化身的希日老银匠，尽管遭到了毒手，而临终时依然带着微笑祝福远走的布尔固德；迷信着“狼吃羊羊可怜，猎人打死狼狼也可怜”的道理的珊丹母，也肯于放走布尔固德；年轻的查干呼为了布尔固德和珊丹的幸福，献出了自己最美好的感情；以及许许多多出场不多的群众……等等，在在都作用于布尔固德的成长，同时也更具体地显示了善良的蒙族人民有着多少可资骄傲的崇高情操！
    辽阔的背景、巨大的情感冲突、鲜明的色调、以及许多优美的对话，使这出戏获有诗般的格调。
    演出基本上体现了原作的精神，青年演员们充沛的热情恰好有利于诗意的传达，如果在演出处理上，能够再集中地刻划一下事件发生的客观环境、再细致地挖掘一下那些颇不简单的人物内心，自然还会更好起来的。
    和一切新的创作一样，剧本不是没有缺点，之所以在此不多谈的原因，是因为我觉得，像“金鹰”这样，通过一个历史的英雄故事，从而体现出做为一个民族共同的不屈性格，尽管也许还不完全，但这努力的成果还是应当放在主要的方面来肯定的。
