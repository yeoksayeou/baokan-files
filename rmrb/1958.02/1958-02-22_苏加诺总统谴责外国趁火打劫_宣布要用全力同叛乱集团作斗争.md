Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 21st: Indonesian President Sukarno announced today that the Indonesian government will resolutely combat the illegal actions of the Husein rebel group in Central Sumatra, which has declared the establishment of a so-called "revolutionary government," using "all the strength it currently possesses." This is President Sukarno's first expression of his attitude towards the actions of the rebels since returning from abroad.

During President Sukarno's absence, the duties of the president were performed by Indonesian Speaker of Parliament Sartono. At the ceremony held today for resuming his presidential duties, President Sukarno also stated that he agrees with the measures taken by the government during his foreign visit and the government's report on the Central Sumatra rebellion on February 3rd.

President Sukarno condemned the actions of the Husein rebel group as violating Indonesia's current laws. He said, "Therefore, I cannot recognize them."

President Sukarno said that we will fight them with all the strength we currently possess. At the same time, we will not ignore wise actions, and we will do our best to avoid any armed actions that may cause significant sacrifices.

President Sukarno clearly pointed out in his speech that some foreign countries have taken advantage of local illegal activities. He said that countries pursuing an independent policy inevitably face pressure "from foreign countries that play an important role in international politics." Since the Netherlands recognized Indonesian sovereignty, all the difficulties and disputes that have arisen in the political, military, and economic spheres have become targets for foreign pressure. The purpose of exerting this pressure is to pull the whole of Indonesia or part of Indonesia into a certain bloc. Local unrest provides an opportunity that external forces have been longing for.

President Sukarno said that if the local demands were made in good faith, the problems between the central government and the local governments would have been resolved long ago. He said that many circumstances prove that the demands of the local authorities have become tools for foreign countries to achieve their aims and to pull the whole or part of Indonesia into a certain bloc. The President reiterated that the current struggle is to safeguard the unity of Indonesia in accordance with the 1945 Declaration of Independence and the government's independent and active policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 21st: On February 20th, Indonesian Air Force amphibious aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights over Central Sumatra, seized by the rebel group, and North Sulawesi, controlled by rebel elements such as Somba, and made a demonstrative landing on Lake Singkarak in Central Sumatra. At the same time, the Air Force Information Office announced that in recent days, Indonesian fighters and bombers have also carried out a series of patrol flights over Sumatra.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 21st: Official sources here revealed that the rebels in Central Sumatra and North Sulawesi are corrupt and selfish individuals.

The Indonesian Ministry of Information said in a radio broadcast on the evening of February 20th that last year, the Central Sumatra rebel Husein and his accomplices obtained foreign exchange worth more than 320 million Indonesian Rupiahs through illegal barter trade. This money was not handed over to the state or allocated for construction purposes; instead, it became their deposits in foreign banks and their domestic properties.

The Army Information Office issued a statement yesterday saying that the coconut barter trade conducted by Somba in North Sulawesi and other members of the "Charter of Universal Struggle Group" organized by former 7th Military Region Commander Sumual has enriched themselves, but has harmed the coconut planters.

    苏加诺总统谴责外国趁火打劫
    宣布要用全力同叛乱集团作斗争
    新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天宣布，印度尼西亚政府要以“目前它所有的全部力量”来同中苏门答腊侯赛尼叛乱集团宣布成立所谓“革命政府”的非法行动进行坚决斗争。这是苏加诺总统从国外回来以后第一次对叛乱分子的行动所表示的态度。
    在苏加诺总统出国期间，由印度尼西亚国会议长沙多诺代行了总统职务。苏加诺总统今天在为接管总统职务而举行的仪式上还说，他同意在他出国访问期间政府所采取的措施和政府在2月3日就中苏门答腊叛乱事件所作的报告。
    苏加诺总统谴责侯赛尼叛乱集团的行动是违背印度尼西亚的现行法律的。他说，“因此，我不能承认他们。”
    苏加诺总统说，我们将用我们目前所拥有的一切力量来同他们进行斗争。同时，我们不会忽视明智的行动，而且我们将尽力去避免可能引起重大牺牲的任何武装行动。
    苏加诺总统在演说中清楚地指出，有些外国利用了地方上的非法活动。他说，凡是执行独立政策的国家，不可避免地会受到“来自在国际政治中起重要作用的外国”的压力。自从荷兰承认印度尼西亚主权以来，在政治、军事和经济方面所发生的一切困难和争执都成了外国施加压力的目标。施加这种压力的目的是为了要把整个印度尼西亚或者一部分印度尼西亚拉到某一集团中去。地方上的骚乱为外界提供了求之不得的机会。
    苏加诺总统说，如果地方上的要求是出于善良的意愿，那末中央政府和地方政府之间的问题就早已解决了。他说，许多情况证实，地方当局的要求成了外国实现它们的目的和把整个或一部分印度尼西亚拉入某一集团的工具。总统重申，目前的斗争是要遵照1945年的独立宣言以及政府的独立而积极的政策来挽回印度尼西亚的团结。
    新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚空军的水陆两用飞机20日在为叛乱集团窃据的中苏门答腊和为宋巴等叛乱分子控制的北苏拉威西上空进行了侦察飞行，并且在中苏门答腊的新卡拉克湖上进行了示威性的降落。同时，空军新闻处宣布，在最近几天，印度尼西亚的驱逐机和轰炸机也在苏门答腊上空进行了一系列的巡逻飞行。
    据新华社雅加达21日电　这里官方人士揭露，中苏门答腊和北苏拉威西的叛乱分子是一些腐化和自私的家伙。
    印度尼西亚情报部20日晚上在电台广播中说，去年，中苏门答腊的叛乱分子侯赛尼和他的同伙通过非法的换货贸易获得价值三亿二千多万印度尼西亚盾的外汇。这笔钱不但没有上缴给国家或者拨充建设之用，相反地，却成了他们在国外银行中的存款和国内的财产。
    陆军新闻处昨天发表声明说，北苏拉威西的宋巴和其他由前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔组织的“全面斗争约章集团”分子进行的椰干换货贸易已经使他们自己致富，但是种植椰子的人却受到了损害。
