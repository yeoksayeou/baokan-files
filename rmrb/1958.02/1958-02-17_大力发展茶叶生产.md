    China has a long history of tea production, but before liberation it was ravaged by reactionary rule for a long time. The tea trees withered, the gardens were barren, and production continued to decline. In 1949, only 820,000 dan were produced, only 18% of the historical peak annual output of 4.5 million dan. The land reform initially liberated the productive forces, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was even higher after agricultural cooperativization. In addition, in the past eight years, party and government leaders at all levels have taken many active measures, such as issuing long-term loans, implementing advance purchases, guaranteeing grain supply to grain-deficient tea areas, and appropriately increasing tea purchase prices, which have powerfully promoted the recovery of tea production. In 1957, the national tea garden area was twice as large as at the beginning of liberation, and the tea production was 2.27 million dan, 2.8 times the output in 1949. In the past eight years, exported tea has been exchanged for 3.42 million tons of steel, maintaining the stability of the domestic market and playing a certain role in improving the lives of people in mountainous areas.

    However, the current tea production is only two-thirds of the pre-war average annual output of 3.4 million dan, and one-half of the peak annual output of 4.5 million dan. Few new gardens have been opened up, some barren tea gardens have not yet been reclaimed, and the yield per unit area of existing tea gardens is also very low, with an average of only about 50 jin of dry tea per mu, only one-third of the yield per unit area of Soviet tea gardens. Although the quality of tea has improved somewhat in recent years, there is still a shortage of high-quality tea.

    In today's great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, can tea production also make a great leap forward? The answer is definitely yes, because: tea generally does not compete with grain and cotton for land; tea trees have a strong adaptability to the natural environment; drought and flood disasters are smaller than those for grain and cotton; the vast mountainous areas south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River are all suitable for tea planting, and now there are fifteen provinces including 649 counties in the country that produce tea; there is still a lot of wasteland in the southern provinces, and there is plenty of room for expansion of tea garden area; China has a large population, and the masses in tea areas generally have experience in producing and manufacturing tea; all these are favorable conditions. Even the existing senile tea trees can be cut and renewed, "rejuvenated," and the picking time extended. If the problem of seedlings is solved by adopting the method of digging wild tea seedlings and asexual reproduction, and the existing tea gardens with missing plants are replanted, it will be equivalent to doubling the tea garden area. Simply increasing the yield per unit area by one time can exceed the highest annual production level in history.

    The existing tea gardens also have great potential for increasing production. In 1957, there were seven counties and cities with a yield of more than 100 jin per mu, among which the highest agricultural cooperative reached 310 jin, and the high-yield tea gardens had a yield of as high as 458 jin per mu. Qimen in Anhui has increased its production fourfold since liberation, and Lianyuan in Hunan has increased it sevenfold. These facts are enough to show the great potential for increasing production. But this requires people to strive hard. Without effort, production cannot be increased, and may even be reduced. In the same area, Xingxing Cooperative in Shuangfeng County, Hunan, increased production by 21% in 1957 compared with 1956, while the neighboring Dabu Cooperative decreased production by 26%. This situation also exists in other regions. This comparison is worth pondering.

    Of course, there are contradictions between current tea production and grain production: first, the task of increasing grain production in tea areas is heavy, and it is easy to neglect tea production; second, it is difficult to arrange labor during the grain and tea production seasons; third, there is not enough fertilizer, and it is difficult to meet all the needs of grain and tea at the same time. However, facts have proved that as long as there is overall planning and specific arrangements, these contradictions can be resolved. The county party committees of Qimen, Anxi, Lianyuan, Wuyuan, Wufeng and other counties have made overall arrangements for grain, tea, forestry and other agricultural and sideline production, strengthened specific leadership, and grain, tea and other crops can all increase production. Qimen County used to have grain transferred in from other places every year, and the task of increasing grain production is heavy. The county party committee proposed to achieve grain self-sufficiency in the next two or three years and strive for surplus; at the same time, it also required tea production to increase by 20% in 1958 on the basis of a 24% increase in 1957; the Anxi County Party Committee put forward the slogan of "double harvest of tea and grain," and in 1958, it required grain and tea to increase production by 20% on the basis of 1957; Wuyuan was a grain-deficient county, but now it has become a surplus-grain county. While grain production has increased, the quantity and quality of tea have also increased and improved. These facts all show that the contradiction between grain and tea production can be resolved. It should be especially noted that after agricultural cooperativization, the labor required for grain, tea and other crops can be arranged in a unified and reasonable manner, which further increases the favorable conditions. Many areas have adopted the method of detailed accounting and live work arrangement, and have established or improved the grain and tea three-guarantee responsibility system, so that both grain and tea production are not neglected. Lianyuan in Hunan proposed "men go to the fields, women pick tea, and old women take care of the children," and these specific experiences can be adopted in various places.

    The competition for fertilizer between grain and tea is a contradiction, but the fertilizer needed for tea is mainly farmyard manure, especially fertile soil, weeds and green manure (commercial fertilizer can only be used in combination), which can all be obtained locally, with low cost and high fertilizer efficiency. In a tea garden of Jingping Cooperative in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, adzuki beans were intercropped as green manure, using two jin of seeds per mu, plus its own labor, costing a total of three yuan and five jiao, while the output of each mu of tea garden increased from 49 jin to 128 jin. This fact shows that as long as the enthusiasm of the masses is mobilized, the source of fertilizer is inexhaustible.

    China is a large country with a population of 600 million. At present, the domestic tea consumption is only a little more than one or two per person per year on average, which is far below the level of Egypt, which consumes an average of one and a half jin per person per year. In China's fraternal ethnic minority areas, it is only thirty-five liang. If the whole country consumes two jin per person per year, it will need more than 12 million dan, plus the need for export, the number will be even greater. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop tea production.

### 大力发展茶叶生产

    大力发展茶叶生产
    我国茶叶生产历史悠久，但在解放前受到反动统治长期摧残，树衰园荒，产量不断减低，1949年只产八十二万担，仅为历史上最高年产量四百五十万担的18％。土地改革初步解放了生产力，农业合作化后群众生产情绪更加高昂，加以八年来各级党政领导采取了不少的积极措施，如发放长期贷款，实行预购，对缺粮的茶区保证供粮，适当提高茶叶收购价格等，有力地促进了茶叶生产的恢复。1957年全国茶园面积较解放初期扩大了一倍，产茶二百二十七万担，为1949年产量的二点八倍。八年来出口的茶叶，可换回钢材三百四十二万吨，保持了国内市场的平稳，对改善山区人民生活也起了一定作用。
    但是，现在茶叶产量还仅及战前常年产量三百四十万担的三分之二，和最高年产量四百五十万担的二分之一。新园开辟尚少，部分荒茶园尚未垦复，现有茶园单位面积产量也很低，每亩平均只有干茶五十斤左右，仅及苏联茶园单位面积产量的三分之一。茶叶品质几年来虽有所提高，但高品质的茶叶仍感不足。
    在全国工、农业生产大跃进的今天，茶叶生产能不能大跃进呢？肯定能够的，因为：茶叶一般不与粮、棉争地；茶树对自然环境的适应性强；旱、涝灾害比粮、棉为小；秦岭和淮河以南广阔山区均宜植茶，现在全国有十五个省包括六百四十九个县产茶；南方各省现在荒地还很多，茶园面积大有扩展的余地；我国人口众多，茶区群众又普遍有生产和制造茶叶的经验；所有这些都是有利的条件。就是现有的衰老茶树，也可以台刈更新，“返老还童”，延长采摘时间。如采用挖野茶苗与无性繁殖的方法解决种苗问题，把现有缺株茶园补植起来，就等于茶园面积增加一倍以上。仅仅把单位面积产量提高一倍，就可超过历史上年产最高水平。
    现有的茶园，增产的潜力也很大。1957年已有单产一百斤以上的县、市有七个，其中最高的农业社达到三百一十斤，丰产茶园有亩产高达四百五十八斤的，安徽祁门解放后生产增长四倍，湖南涟源增长七倍。这些事实都足以说明增产潜力之大。但这是需要人们努力争取的。不努力就不能增产，甚至会减产。在同一地区如湖南双峰县星星社1957年比1956年增产21％，而毗邻的大埠社则减产26％。其他地区也有这种情形。这种对比值得人们深思。
    当然，当前茶叶生产和粮食生产是有矛盾的：第一，茶区粮食增产任务大，容易忽略茶叶生产；第二，粮、茶生产季节劳动力难以安排；第三，肥料不够，同时满足粮、茶的全部需要有困难。但是，事实证明，只要全面规划，具体安排，这些矛盾是可以解决的。中共祁门、安溪、涟源、婺源、五峰等县县委，全面安排了粮、茶、林及其他农副业生产，加强了具体领导，粮食、茶叶和其他农作物均能增产。祁门粮食每年由外地调入，粮食增产任务重，县委提出在今后两三年内达到粮食自给，争取多余；同时也要求茶叶生产在1957年增长24％的基础上，1958年再增产20％；安溪县委提出“茶粮两丰收”的口号，1958年要求粮食、茶叶在1957年基础上增产20％；婺源是个缺粮县，现已变为余粮县，与粮食增产同时，茶叶的数量、质量均能有所增长和提高。这些事实都说明粮、茶生产的矛盾是能够解决的。尤其应当注意的，是农业合作化以后，粮、茶和其他农作物所需劳动力可以统一合理的安排，这就更增加了有利的条件。许多地区采用算细账、活路排队的办法，已经建立或健全了粮、茶三包责任制，做到了粮、茶生产两不误。湖南涟源提出“男下田，女采茶，老婆婆带娃娃”，这些具体经验各地都可以采用。
    粮、茶争肥是个矛盾，但茶叶所需肥料主要是农家肥，特别是肥土、野草和绿肥（商品肥料只能配合使用），这些都可以就地取材，成本低，肥效大。浙江淳安县井坪社的一块茶园，间作赤豆当绿肥，每亩用种子二斤，加上自己劳力，共花工本三元五角，而每亩茶园的产量却由四十九斤提高到一百二十八斤。这个事实说明，只要发动起群众的干劲，肥源是取之不尽的。
    我国是六亿人口的大国，目前国内茶叶消费量平均每人每年只有一两多，远远低于埃及平均每人每年消费一斤半的水平。我国兄弟民族地区，也只有三十五两。如果全国每人每年消费二斤，即需要一千二百万担以上，再加出口的需要，则为数更大。因此必须大力发展茶叶生产。
