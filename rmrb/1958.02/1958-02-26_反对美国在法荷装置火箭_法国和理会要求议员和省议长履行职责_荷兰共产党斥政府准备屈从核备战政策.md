Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 24th: The French National Peace Council, signed by Mrs. Farge and Jacques Madaule, sent letters to the presidents of provincial councils in France, urging them to fulfill their responsibilities and solicit opinions from the residents they represent on the issue of their provinces potentially becoming atomic bases. The letters pointed out that, according to the government's decision to allow the establishment of rocket bases on French territory, every province is at risk of being selected as a rocket base and nuclear warhead storage site.

Prior to this, Mrs. Farge and Madaule had sent letters to all members of the French National Assembly and the Republic Senate, urging them to express opposition to the establishment of rocket launch sites in France.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: TASS, The Hague, February 24th: The Dutch newspaper "De Waarheid" published a statement by the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party regarding the Dutch government's preparation to establish U.S. rocket bases in the Netherlands.

The statement pointed out that the broad masses of the Dutch people are concerned about the government's plans, which can only exacerbate the international situation. Once the Netherlands is dragged into the aggressive war of the anti-socialist camp, these plans hold dire consequences for the Netherlands.

The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party called on Dutch Communist Party members to more resolutely convince the people that "it is necessary to fully oppose the plan to establish U.S. atomic rocket launch sites."

    荷兰共产党斥政府准备屈从核备战政策
    据新华社巴黎24日电　法国全国和平理事会由法奇夫人和雅克·马道尔署名分别致函法国各省省议会议长，要求他们履行职责，就本省可能变为原子基地的问题向他们所代表的居民征求意见。信中指出，根据政府同意在法国领土上建立火箭基地的决定，每个省都有被选作火箭基地和核弹头仓库的危险。
    在此以前，法奇夫人和马道尔曾致函法国国民议会和共和国参议院全体议员，要求他们表示反对在法国建立火箭发射台。
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社海牙24日讯：荷兰“真理报”刊登了荷兰共产党中央委员会政治局就荷兰政府准备在荷兰设置美国火箭基地一事的声明。
    声明指出，荷兰广大人民对政府的这种计划表示忧虑，这些计划只能促使国际局势更加尖锐。一旦荷兰被拖入反社会主义阵营各国的侵略战争中去，这种计划就对荷兰蕴藏着惨重的后果。
    荷兰共产党中央委员会政治局号召荷兰共产党员更加顽强地说服人民，使他们相信“必须全力反对建立美国原子火箭发射场的计划”。
