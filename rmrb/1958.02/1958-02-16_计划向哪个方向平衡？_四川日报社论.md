Which Direction Should Planning Balance Towards?
—Sichuan Daily Editorial

Should industrial production undergo a great leap forward? Can it undergo a great leap forward? Dare we undertake a great leap forward? In the face of this serious question, two opposing ideas are in struggle. This struggle of ideas is currently prominently reflected in the formulation of production plans, in the different attitudes towards balance. One advocates organizing the balance according to the backward links, and the other advocates realizing the balance according to the advanced links. The former attitude is a deterrent, while the latter attitude is a promoter. The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee, when reviewing this year's production plan, overturned the passive balance plan and resolutely became a promoter, which is a revolutionary leap forward.

Why do promoters and deterrents emerge in dealing with plan balancing? From the situation of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, it stems from the different views between the promoters and deterrents on many important issues, so they draw fundamentally different conclusions in the face of the same facts.

First, in dealing with the experiences and lessons of the 1956 industrial production upsurge, in the eyes of the deterrents, the 1956 plan was "adventurous," making all aspects very "tense," and despite great efforts, the plan was not completed. They therefore conclude that the plan is best set lower, preferably with more over-fulfillment in the future. They use the excuse of "stability" to cover up their creeping thoughts of fearing tension and attempting to live a comfortable life. The promoters' view is completely different. In their view, although the 1956 plan was set higher in some aspects, bringing some tension, it also brought revolutionary drive. Although the national plan was not completed in 1956, the growth of production was astonishing. In that year, the company's total output value increased by 22.85%, steel increased by nearly 50%, and steel materials increased by 35.29%. Apart from the factor of the completion and commissioning of a new large-scale steelmaking workshop in 1955, this rate of development exceeded any year in history. Because of the leap forward in production in this year, the company was able to complete the first five-year plan one year ahead of schedule. Therefore, they believe that even if the plan is not completed, it is glorious. On the contrary, the act of wanting to over-fulfill the national plan without much effort and easily is an inglorious act.

The promoters dare to leap forward and formulate a balanced plan according to the most active production factors, while the deterrents are always full of concerns and cannot break through the passive balance. This is also because the promoters see the endless potential hidden in the masses, while the deterrents only see some dead figures. As early as September last year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, according to the 1957 plan level and the production situation at that time, compiled a production plan to increase steel and steel materials by 27% and 17% respectively in 1958. At that time, in people's eyes, this indicator was not high enough, and the speed was not fast enough. However, in the fourth quarter of last year, after the rectification movement, the awareness of employees was greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. The workers created many unprecedented achievements, making a big step forward in production. As a result, the actual output for the whole year of 1957 not only greatly exceeded the national plan for 1957, but also exceeded the originally compiled 1958 production plan, which was planned to increase by 17% and 27%. For such a fact, the deterrents only regard it as an "accidental" phenomenon and still believe in the figures on paper. Although they calculated again and again in the office and revised the plan twice, they still could not break through the original circle and regarded the original production imbalance as an insurmountable red line. But the promoters, on the contrary, saw from the extraordinary achievements in production in the fourth quarter the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and masses for socialism after the rectification movement. They firmly believe that relying on the socialist enthusiasm of the masses and the creative power that comes from it can change the backward links in production and achieve an advanced and positive balance. Therefore, they dare to formulate a positive balance plan and use the set of mass line working methods they learned in the rectification movement to hand over the plan to the masses, point out the goals of struggle to the masses, state the difficulties, mobilize the masses to speak out freely and debate extensively, mobilize everyone to think of ways to overcome backwardness, tap potential, and look to advanced links.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company does have huge difficulties in realizing a positively balanced plan. Due to the limitation of equipment imbalance, more than two-thirds of the pig iron needed by Chongqing Iron and Steel Company must rely on supply from other factories. The promoters and deterrents also have fundamental differences in their attitude towards this difficulty: the deterrents believe that this problem cannot be solved by the unit itself. Therefore, they are at a loss in the face of difficulties. The promoters do not shy away from difficulties. When they see the difficulties, they also see the other side: they see not only their own unit but also the overall situation. They believe that under the current leaping situation, not only does their own unit need to leap forward, but other factories and mines are also leaping forward; especially this year, the local iron smelting industry in the province will have a leaping development, which provides the possibility to overcome the difficulty of insufficient pig iron supply. Not only that, but in view of the current lack of technical force and low production level in local small iron smelting plants, if technical personnel from their own factory are transferred to help small iron plants improve their technology, they can greatly exert the potential of small plants, which can not only help small plants develop production, but also solve the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply for their own enterprises. In this way, mutual promotion and the possibility of overcoming difficulties can become a reality. Therefore, they are full of courage and confidence in overcoming difficulties.

From the above situation, the problem is very obvious. The reason why the promoters and deterrents have different conclusions on many major issues is because the deterrents only see the backward and negative side of things, and cannot see the advanced and positive side of things; they only see the difficulties, and cannot see the factors to overcome the difficulties. In the final analysis, one is looking forward, and the other is looking backward!

In industrial production, whether it is between enterprises or between various departments within an enterprise, balance is always relative, temporary, and conditional; imbalance is absolute and eternal. Balance is the relative equilibrium in production; imbalance is the contradiction that exists from beginning to end in production. Where there is contradiction, there is struggle, and where there is struggle, there is development. This is the general law of production development. The deterrents advocate building the plan on backward links and carrying out passive balance, which is essentially avoiding contradictions, avoiding struggle, and not wanting to move forward. The reason why active balance is valuable is that they acknowledge contradictions, resolutely struggle, and vigorously promote. Therefore, they dare to jump out of the old balance and boldly organize the balance according to the most active factors, opening up roads for advanced things.

The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee does have many difficulties in realizing a plan to organize production balance from the active side. But in the face of revolutionary heroism, difficulties exist to be overcome. We hope that all employees of the Iron and Steel Company will overcome all difficulties, ride the wind and waves, and move forward, and we hope that the leaders of other factories and mines will learn from the great leap forward spirit of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, quickly overcome conservative ideas, organize balance from the active side, and jointly promote socialist construction!

    计划向哪个方向平衡？
    ——四川日报社论
    工业生产要不要大跃进？能不能大跃进？敢不敢大跃进？在这个严重的问题面前，有两种对立的思想进行着斗争。这两种思想斗争，当前突出地反映在制订生产计划的时候，对待平衡有两种不同的态度。一种是主张按照落后的环节来组织平衡，另一种主张按照先进的环节来实现平衡。前一种态度属于促退，后一种态度则是促进。重庆钢铁公司党委在审查今年生产计划的时候，推翻了消极平衡计划，坚决地当了促进派，这是一个革命的跃进。
    对待计划平衡为什么会出现促进派和促退派呢？从重庆钢铁公司的情况看来，它导源于在许多重要的问题上促进派和促退派之间有着不同的看法，所以面对同样的事实得出了根本不同的结论。
    首先，在对待1956年工业生产高潮的经验教训方面，在促退派看来，1956年的计划订得“冒了”，弄得各方面都很“紧张”，费了很大力气，也没有完成计划。他们因此得出结论说，计划最好还是订低一些，宁可将来多超额。他们借口“稳”来掩盖自己害怕紧张、企图过轻松日子的爬行思想。促进派的看法则完全不同。在他们看来，1956年计划在某些方面虽然订得高了一些，带来了一些紧张，但也带来了革命干劲。尽管1956年没有完成国家计划，但生产的增长是惊人的。在这一年，全公司的生产总值增长了22.85％，钢增长近50％，钢材增长35.29％，除开1955年新建大型炼钢车间完工投入生产这一因素，这个发展的速度超过了历史上的任何一年。由于这一年生产的飞跃发展，才使得公司能够提前一年完成第一个五年计划。因此，他们认为：即使没有完成计划，也是光荣的。相反，那种想不费好大力气、轻轻松松地超额完成国家计划，倒是不光采的行为。
    促进派敢于跃进，按照最积极的生产因素制订平衡计划，而促退派则始终顾虑重重，突不破消极平衡，还在于促进派看到了在群众当中蕴藏着的无穷无尽的潜力，而促退派看到的则只是一些死的数字。重庆钢铁公司早在去年9月份就按照1957年的计划水平和当时的生产情况，编制了在1958年把钢和钢材分别提高27％和17％的幅度的生产计划。当时，在人们看来，这个指标不为不高，速度不为不快。但去年四季度，经过整风运动，职工觉悟大大提高，生产积极性空前高涨，工人们创造了许多前所未有的成绩，使生产跃进了一大步。结果1957年全年实际产量，不仅大大超过了1957年的国家计划，也超过了预订增长17％、27％的原编1958年的生产计划。对于这样的事实，促退派仅仅把它看成是一个“偶然”的现象，仍然相信纸面上的数字。尽管他们坐在办公室里一算再算，两次修订计划，仍然突不破原来的圈圈，把原有的生产不平衡状况，看成是不可逾越的雷池。但促进派与此相反，他们从四季度生产上的非凡成就中，看到了职工群众在整风之后表现出来的奔向社会主义的革命热情。他们坚信，依靠群众的社会主义的热情和由此而来的创造力量，就可以改变生产上的落后环节，达到先进的积极的平衡。因此，他们敢于制订积极的平衡计划，并运用他们在整风中学到的一套群众路线的工作方法，把计划交给群众，向群众指出奋斗目标，摆明困难，发动群众大鸣大放，大争大辩，发动群众人人想办法来克服落后，发掘潜力，向先进环节看齐。
    重庆钢铁公司要实现积极平衡的计划，的确有巨大的困难。由于设备不平衡的限制，重庆钢铁公司所需要的生铁有三分之二以上要依靠外厂供应。对待这个困难的态度，促进派和促退派也有根本的分歧：促退派认为，这个问题不是本单位所能解决的。因而对待困难束手无策。促进派并不回避困难，当他们在看到困难的同时，还看到了另外一面：他们不仅看到了本单位而且看到了全局。他们认为，在当前飞跃的形势下，不仅本单位需要跃进，其他厂矿也在大跃进；特别是今年本省地方炼铁事业将有飞跃的发展，这就为克服生铁供应不足的困难提供了可能性。不仅如此，他们鉴于目前地方小炼铁厂缺乏技术力量，生产水平不高，如果抽调本厂技术人员去帮助小铁厂提高技术，就可以大大发挥小厂潜力，既帮助小厂发展了生产，又可以解决本企业原料供应不足的困难。这样相互促进，克服困难的可能性就可以成为现实。因此，他们对克服困难，勇气十足，信心百倍。
    从上述情况看来，问题是很明显的了。促进派和促退派之所以在许多重大问题上有着不同的结论，就因为促退派所看到的只是事物落后的、消极的一面，而看不见事物先进的、积极的一面；只是看到了困难，看不见克服困难的因素。归根结蒂，一个是向前看，一个是向后看！
    在工业生产中，无论是企业与企业之间，也无论是企业内部各个部门之间，平衡总是相对的，暂时的，有条件的；不平衡则是绝对的、永恒的。平衡就是生产上的相对均衡；不平衡就是生产上自始至终都存在着矛盾。有矛盾就有斗争，有斗争才有发展。这是生产发展的一般规律。促退派主张把计划建筑在落后的环节上，进行消极的平衡，实质上就是回避矛盾，回避斗争，不要前进。积极平衡之所以可贵，就在于他们承认矛盾，坚决斗争，大力促进。因而他们敢于从陈旧的平衡中跳出来，大胆地依照最积极的因素组织平衡，为先进事物开辟道路。
    重庆钢铁公司党委要实现从积极方面组织生产平衡的计划，的确有许多困难。但在革命英雄主义面前，困难是为被克服而存在的。我们希望钢铁公司全体职工排除万难、乘风破浪、向前迈进，更希望其它厂矿的领导人，学习重庆钢铁公司大跃进的精神，迅速战胜保守思想，从积极方面组织平衡，共同促进社会主义建设！
