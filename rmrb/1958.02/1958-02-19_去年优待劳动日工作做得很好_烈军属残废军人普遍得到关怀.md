Xinhua News Agency, February 18th -- Approximately 30% of households with families of martyrs, military families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers in rural areas across the country who have no or insufficient labor were given preferential treatment labor days by agricultural production cooperatives in 1957.

　　1957 was the second year that rural areas across the country changed from the method of substitute farming to the implementation of preferential treatment labor days for families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers. As a result of implementing this method, the lives of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers have become more secure. According to statistics from 510 counties and cities in eleven provinces including Hunan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, 436,027 households of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers enjoyed preferential treatment labor days, averaging approximately 60 preferential labor days per household. In Xiuwu County, Henan Province, 538 households of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers, totaling 2,415 people, enjoyed preferential treatment labor days. The labor days they did themselves plus the preferential labor days from the agricultural cooperatives averaged 91.7 labor days per person for the year, 8.3 labor days more than the average member. In Tuanjie Township, Chenggu County, Shaanxi Province, 26 households of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers enjoyed preferential treatment labor days in 1957. Among them, 21 households had roughly the same standard of living as ordinary members, and 5 households had a higher standard of living than ordinary members.

　　In order to give play to the production enthusiasm of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers, agricultural cooperatives, while assessing the number of preferential treatment labor days for them, also assessed the number of labor days they could do themselves, and carefully arranged for families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers with semi-labor capacity to engage in agricultural and sideline production. The Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Dongcun Township, Xin County, Shanxi Province, uniformly arranged for 15 people, including Zhang Quansheng, families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers with weak labor power, to work in breeding, vegetable growing, fertilizer accumulation, and storage; 19 people, including Hao Funian, who could only do some light labor, were also arranged to do light work such as planting, thinning, weeding, cotton pruning, threshing, and seed selection. As a result of taking care in the division of labor and industry, Zhang Quansheng, who is sixty-eight years old, did one and a half times more labor days himself than in the past.

　　The glorious tradition of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers has also been further developed in the work of preferential treatment labor days. Agricultural cooperative cadres and members in various places respect and care for families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers. In Shenyang, Suizhong, and other places in Liaoning Province, families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers with only one person in the household were given preferential treatment as a household of two, and households with only two people were given preferential treatment as three. Many areas have also formed preferential treatment groups or designated special personnel to take care of the daily chores such as fetching water, chopping firewood, and washing clothes, as well as illnesses, for lonely, widowed, elderly, and weak households among families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers who are dependent on no one. For example, Luan County, Shanxi Province, has established a total of 437 preferential treatment groups, responsible for taking care of 329 lonely and helpless families of martyrs, military families, and disabled soldiers in the county.

　　After the method of preferential treatment labor days was implemented in various places, the burden on the people has also been greatly reduced. During the period of substitute farming, the people in some areas had to bear about ten workdays a year, but now, after adopting the method of preferential treatment labor days, the burden in general areas accounts for less than 1% of the net income of the members. In Fengjia Township, Zichang County, Shaanxi Province, each labor force had to bear an average of eight dou of substitute farming grain and 2,400 jin of firewood per year during the substitute farming period. After preferential treatment labor days in 1957, the average burden was less than one labor day.

　　Although the work of preferential treatment labor days has achieved certain results in various places, there are still some problems. Various places are combining the Spring Festival's activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers to conduct inspections and corrections, and are deploying the work of preferential treatment labor days in 1958.

    去年优待劳动日工作做得很好
    烈军属残废军人普遍得到关怀
    据新华社18日讯　在全国农村的烈属、军属、革命残废军人中，约有30％左右无劳动力或缺少劳动力的户，在1957年中受到了农业生产合作社给予劳动日的优待。
  　1957年是全国各地农村对烈属、军属和残废军人由代耕办法改变为实行优待劳动日办法的第二年。实施这个办法的结果，烈属、军属、残废军人的生活更加有了保障。据湖南、山西、江苏、安徽、广东、甘肃、陕西、河北、湖北、江西、四川等十一个省的五百一十个县、市的统计，享受优待劳动日的烈属、军属、残废军人有四十三万六千零二十七户，平均每户约享受六十个劳动日的优待。河南省修武县有享受优待劳动日的烈属、军属、残废军人五百三十八户二千四百一十五人，他们自己做的加上农业社优待的劳动日，全年平均每人有九十一点七个劳动日，比一般社员多八点三个劳动日。陕西省城固县团结乡，1957年享受优待劳动日的有二十六户烈属、军属和残废军人，其中与一般社员的生活水平大体相等的共二十一户，高于一般社员生活水平的有五户。
    为了发挥烈属、军属、残废军人的生产积极性，农业合作社一面评定对他们优待劳动日的数目，一面评定他们自己能做的劳动日，并且认真地安排具有半劳动力的烈属、军属、残废军人进行农副业生产。山西省忻县董村乡红光农业社对劳动力弱的烈属、军属、残废军人张全生等十五人，统一安排作饲养、种菜、积肥和保管工作；对只能做些轻微劳动的郝福年等十九人，也安排了点种、间苗、拔草、棉花整枝、打场、选种等轻活。由于在分工分业上进行了照顾，六十八岁的张全生自己做的劳动日比过去增加了一倍半。
    拥军优属的光荣传统，在优待劳动日工作中也得到了进一步的发挥。各地农业社干部和社员群众，对烈属、军属、残废军人都很尊敬和关怀。辽宁省沈阳、绥中等地，对一户只有一口人的烈属、军属、残废军人，都按一户两口人优待，一户只有两口人的按三口人优待。许多地区还组成了优抚小组或指定专人，照顾烈属、军属、残废军人中无依无靠的孤寡老弱户的吃水、打柴、洗衣等日常零活和疾病等。例如山西省潞安县共建立了四百三十七个优抚小组，负责照管全县三百二十九名孤老无依的烈属、军属、残废军人。
    优待劳动日的办法在各地推行以后，人民群众的负担也大为减轻。在代耕时期，有些地区的人民一年要负担十个工左右，现在采取优待劳动日办法后，一般地区的负担，只占社员纯收入的1％以下。陕西省子长县冯家乡在代耕时期每个劳动力每年平均负担八斗代耕粮、二千四百斤柴，1957年优待劳动日后，平均负担不到一个劳动日。
    各地的优待劳动日工作虽然取得了一定成绩，但还存在着一些问题，各地正在结合春节拥军优属活动进行检查、纠正，并部署1958年的优待劳动日工作。
