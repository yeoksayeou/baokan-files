I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 fiscal budget and the draft 1958 national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, and I suggest that the congress approve them.

In 1957, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, Fuxin City, Liaoning Province, like other regions of the country, achieved great successes on both the political and production fronts. Through the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, we smashed the frenzied attacks of the Rightists and raised the political and ideological awareness of the people. Especially after carrying out rectification and socialist education in factories and mines, a high tide of extensive airing of views, great debates, and thorough reforms emerged. The leadership style of cadres was greatly improved, and the workers received a profound self-class education, thereby boosting their production enthusiasm and initiative to an unprecedented level, and overfulfilling the 1957 production increase and conservation plan.

The great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer is an inspiring bugle call. The workers in our city, especially the coal, electricity, and steel workers, have all mustered revolutionary vigor and are doing everything possible to tap the potential of enterprises in order to realize this glorious and arduous historical task.

The problem facing us is to spur our horses and forge ahead bravely. This year, we adopted two forms of discussing the plan: a three-level cadre meeting (absorbing veteran workers) and a workers' congress at the pit (workshop) level, as well as new methods of extensive airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters. Please allow me to make the following brief report on our situation in formulating and implementing the plan.

I. The Plan Becomes More Advanced Each Time, and Output Increases Each Time

Ideological promotion defeated conservative thought, and advanced plans were formulated in every industrial system. Now, let me just talk about the situation of the Fuxin Mining Bureau: Before the three-level cadre meeting, the draft national plan for the bureau was 8.26 million tons. The Shenyang Administration then set it at 8.5 million tons. After the central government put forward the call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, the mining bureau put forward a production increase and conservation plan of 8.7 million tons, striving for 9 million tons. The Municipal Party Committee decided that the national plan should be 8.8 million tons, guaranteeing the completion of 9 million tons for the production increase and conservation plan, and striving for 9.2 million tons. We thought this was very advanced; the units only acknowledged submitting 4 million yuan in profits, far from the 15.5 million yuan target given by the Administration; labor efficiency and cost indicators were also very low. After eight days (January 13 to January 20) of the three-level cadre meeting, the situation changed. Through a combination of large meetings and small meetings, both inside and outside the meetings, and between leaders and those led, technical personnel and veteran workers, and factories and mines, and pits (workshops), extensive ideological fermentation was carried out. Advanced ideas clashed with conservative ideas, all kinds of conservative ideas were criticized, and potential emerged. Everyone unanimously believed that the bureau could produce 9.355 million tons of coal this year, an increase of 1.095 million tons over the first draft plan. The Municipal Party Committee decided on a national plan of 8.8 million tons, guaranteeing the completion of 9.2 million tons for the production increase and conservation plan, and striving for 9.355 million tons. Based on 9.2 million tons, this is an increase of 1.64 million tons over the actual output in 1957, an increase of 21.7 percent; profits submitted increased to 17.5 million yuan, striving for more than 20 million yuan; costs this year are 9.59 percent lower than last year; overall efficiency is 19 percent higher than last year, coal extraction efficiency is 26 percent higher than last year, and tunneling efficiency is 15 percent higher than last year. People were very satisfied with this meeting, considering it a meeting of promotion.

The Municipal Party Committee and veteran workers understood that the potential for coal was still great. The Municipal Party Committee decided to use ten days, taking the pit as the unit, to adopt the methods of extensive airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to discuss the national plan and the production increase and conservation plan, formulate the pit (workshop) operation plan and measures plan to ensure the realization of the plan, as well as individual guarantee plans. At the same time, it called on the coal output and other indicators stipulated by the three-level cadre meeting to be greatly broken through, and put forward the slogan of catching up with the coal capital Fushun in raw coal output. This is a fighting slogan that has inspired new vigor in the workers. After ten days of extensive airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, the output, quality, efficiency, cost, and profit indicators of the three-level cadre meeting were criticized as soon as they were given to the masses, who considered them conservative and greatly broke through them. The figures proposed by the workers were close to 10 million tons. The Municipal Party Committee decided (with the consent of the Shenyang Administration) that the national plan for this year would be 9.2 million tons, guaranteeing the completion of the production increase and conservation plan of 9.6 million tons, and striving for 10 million tons. Based on 9.6 million tons, this is an increase of 2.05 million tons over the actual output last year, an increase of 27.1 percent; 10 million tons is an increase of 32.3 percent over the actual output last year. The workers believed that this was a leap forward plan.

II. To Have a Leap Forward Plan, There Must Be Leap Forward Thinking

The experience of the rectification campaign proves that the more thoroughly the rectification and reform are carried out, the higher the workers' enthusiasm, and the better the production tasks are completed. This planning proves that the workers' enthusiasm is high and their thinking is advanced, so a leap forward plan has emerged. The vivid facts of this planning have greatly educated the leading cadres and the worker ranks.

When discussing the plan, the workers said: "In the past, Britain oppressed us, but now they don't dare to oppress us anymore. On the contrary, we have to compete with them. They are like old women celebrating the New Year, getting worse every year. Muster our energy, and we can catch up with this old fool in five or ten years without fifteen years." They also said: "This year, the national plan is for us to formulate, this is not just a joke, we really have to show something." The workers' slogan is to surpass the coal capital of Fushun in coal production, and surpass Hongshan Mine in efficiency. In this way, everyone sits together to hold a Zhuge Liang meeting, face to face, discussing facts and reasoning, and many things that were previously unthinkable have been thought of by the masses, and many potentials that could not be discovered before have been tapped by the masses; many indicators that were previously considered advanced have become backward indicators. Advanced indicators such as output, quality, cost, profits submitted, and labor efficiency have emerged in this way. The workers believe that they have truly become masters of their own affairs this time, not only asking us to make plans, but also really modifying the plans according to our opinions, greatly increasing their sense of responsibility as masters; the cadres have further realized that without the advanced thinking of the workers, such a leap forward plan cannot be formulated, and they have further realized the importance of fully promoting democracy and relying on the masses to do a good job in production; engineering and technical personnel feel that the slide rule can calculate accurate numbers, but cannot calculate the enthusiasm and potential of the working class, increasing their confidence in combining with the workers to do a good job in production. Through this fact, our Municipal Party Committee also deeply feels that in the face of the new situation, the bureaucratic style of leadership lagging behind the masses and understanding lagging behind reality is very serious, and at the same time, it shows that correct collective leadership must be built on the basis of the mass line. With the encouragement and supervision of the masses, the leadership can always maintain political sensitivity, thoroughly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and better realize the Party's resolutions. The mission of leaders is to be good at discovering new things in their infancy and support their growth. Only the leadership method of constantly "coming from the masses and going to the masses" can continuously enrich and improve leadership, so that the revolutionary cause can move forward continuously.

What is the secret to formulating an advanced plan in just eighteen days? There is none. The principle is very simple, that is, to rely on and believe in the masses. The combination of leadership and the masses immediately generates tremendous material strength. This plan is a collective creation of workers, leading cadres, and engineering and technical personnel, so it is advanced and fully reliable, and of course, it will be overfulfilled. As the workers say, "We say what we do, and the working class keeps its word." Last year, we spent three months formulating the plan, and the item of profits submitted alone was repeatedly balanced six times before it was finalized. Why did it take so long? This is because we did not rely on the masses, but discussed it in layers in the house, which is a bureaucratic approach that is divorced from reality. Last year and this year's planning are two different methods and two different results. This experience and lesson must be remembered.

III. Riding the Wind and Waves, Catching Up Head-On

The Party Central Committee's call to catch up with or surpass Britain in fifteen years has already formed a huge force among the masses. We believe that this international competition is not only an economic competition, but also has far-reaching political significance. It is to compete to see which political and social system is better. We are a country where the working people are the masters, and the wisdom and creativity of the masses are endless. Only by believing in and relying on the masses can we overcome the greatest difficulties, and certain negative factors will be transformed into positive factors. Therefore, we are willing to work with fraternal coal mines to forge ahead bravely and strive to surpass Britain in coal production in about five years. We must humbly learn from the advanced experience of leadership in various places and learn from the advanced industrial level of the country and the world. In raw coal production, we learn from the coal capital of Fushun, and in labor efficiency, we learn from Hongshan Mine, and strive to surpass them.

In order to successfully complete the 1958 national plan and the production increase and conservation plan, we must thoroughly carry out the rectification movement, which is the main driving force for promoting all work. Only with a great leap forward in thinking can there be a great leap forward in production. Here are two examples. The Fifth Pit of Xinqiu Mine failed to complete its tasks for twenty-four months, and replaced five pit leaders, three general branch secretaries, and four engineers, but it was still ineffective. However, since the start of the rectification campaign, the leading cadres have changed their style, gone deep into the front lines, relied on the masses, and believed in the masses. Many major production problems have been solved, and the morale of the masses has been unprecedentedly high, overfulfilling the tasks every month, and turning from backward to advanced. In Ping'an Third Pit, the leading cadres work in the pit every day, sharing labor and hardships with the masses, solving major production problems, and not only overfulfilling the tasks every month, but also creating a new record of ten tons of coal per shift. In August last year, the chief engineer of Ping'an Mine calculated that the coal task could not be completed and proposed reducing the plan by more than 100,000 tons. The Party Committee disagreed. After the rectification campaign was launched, the 1957 plan was overfulfilled, making them realize that when formulating the plan, they must have a full estimate of the enthusiasm of the workers. This shows that a leap forward in political ideology promotes a leap forward in the economy, and a leap forward in the economy in turn promotes a leap forward in political ideology. The two permeate each other and promote each other, which also shows that the rectification upsurge must be combined with the production upsurge to move forward, so that work achievements can become greater and greater.

The Fuxin Mining Bureau has already victoriously overfulfilled the raw coal production task for January by more than 30,000 tons, which has created a good start for completing and overfulfilling this year's plan. While concentrating their efforts on formulating the plan, the city's industrial systems have already uncovered more than 22 million yuan of accumulation and waste, and this anti-waste upsurge is developing in depth. The workers have expressed one after another: do not give extra rewards if we don't catch up with Britain; the team leaders have expressed: when we catch up with Britain, then we will want team leader allowances. The masses consciously do not want or save labor protection supplies, and the city's workers have created an atmosphere of diligence and thrift being glorious and waste being shameful. Workers who planned to go home for marriage during the Spring Festival, after hearing the news of the Party Central Committee's call to catch up with Britain, wrote letters to the women, postponing the wedding period in order to produce more coal; workers who were newly married and planned to go home for the Spring Festival to pay New Year's greetings did not go back either. This selfless spirit of labor is a reliable guarantee for us to complete the national plan in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

Finally, I once again express: we must muster our energy, humbly learn from the advanced experience of fraternal factories and mines, and learn from the national and world industrial production level. We are determined to move forward in a fighting posture, riding the wind and waves and catching up head-on. We will use our great leap forward in production to complete the glorious task of the first year of the second five-year plan more, faster, better, and more economically, and use this as a gift to celebrate the convening of the Second National People's Congress of our country.

### 通过大鸣大放大辩论  生产计划才能订先进  丘新野代表的发言

　　通过大鸣大放大辩论  生产计划才能订先进
    丘新野代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年财政预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告和吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告，并建议大会通过。
    辽宁省阜新市在党中央和省委的直接领导下，一九五七年和全国其他地区一样，在政治战线上和生产战线上，都取得了很大的成就。通过整风和反右派斗争，击破了右派分子的猖狂进攻，提高了人们的政治思想觉悟，特别在厂矿开展整风和社会主义教育以后，出现了大鸣大放和大整大改的高潮，干部领导作风有了很大的改进，职工们受到了一次深刻的自我阶级教育，从而生产积极性和热情空前高涨，超额完成了一九五七年的增产节约计划。
    党中央和毛主席所提出的在十五年或者稍多一点时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召，是一个振奋人心的号角。我市职工们，特别是煤炭、电力和钢铁工人们，都鼓起了革命干劲，千方百计地挖掘企业潜力，来实现这一光荣而又艰巨的历史任务。
    摆在我们面前的问题是快马加鞭地奋勇前进。我们今年讨论计划采取了三级干部会议（吸收老工人参加）与坑口（车间）职工大会两种形式，和大鸣大放大辩论大字报的新方法。请允许我把我们制订计划和执行计划的情况，作如下的简要汇报。
　　一、计划一次比一次先进，产量一次比一次提高
    促进思想战胜了保守思想，各个工业系统都订出了先进计划，现仅就阜新矿务局的情况说一说：在三级干部会议以前，全局国家计划草案为八百二十六万吨，沈阳管理局又订为八百五十万吨，中央提出十五年赶上英国的号召，矿务局又提出增产节约计划为八百七十万吨，争取九百万吨，市委决定国家计划为八百八十万吨，增产节约计划保证完成九百万吨，为九百二十万吨奋斗，我们自以为很先进了；上缴利润各单位只承认四百万元，与管理局给的一千五百五十万元的指标距离很远；劳动效率和成本等指标都很低。经过八天（一月十三至一月二十日）三级干部会议情况就变了。通过大会套小会，会内会外的结合，领导与被领导之间，技术人员与老工人之间，厂矿、坑口（车间）之间，进行广泛的思想酝酿，先进思想与保守思想交锋，形形色色的保守思想被批判了，潜力就涌现出来了。大家一致认为今年全局煤炭可以出产九百三十五万五千吨，这个数字比第一次计划草案的数字增加一百零九万五千吨。市委决定国家计划八百八十万吨，增产节约计划保证完成九百二十万吨，为九百三十五万五千吨奋斗。按九百二十万吨计算，比一九五七年实产量增加了一百六十四万吨，即增长了百分之二十一点七；上缴利润增加到一千七百五十万元，为二千万元以上奋斗；成本今年比上年实际降低百分之九点五九；全员效率比上年实际提高百分之十九，回采工效率比上年实际提高百分之二十六，掘进工效率比上年实际提高百分之一十五。人们对这次会议很满意，认为这次会是一次促进的会议。
    市委与老工人了解煤炭潜力仍然很大。市委决定以坑口为单位，以十天的时间采取大鸣大放大辩论大字报的方法，讨论国家计划和增产节约计划，订出坑口（车间）的作业计划和保证计划实现的措施计划，以及个人的保证计划，同时号召三级干部会议规定的煤炭产量和其他指标可以大大地突破，提出原煤产量赶上煤都抚顺的口号，这是一个战斗口号，鼓起了工人新的干劲。经过十天大鸣大放大辩论大字报，三级干部会议的产量、质量、效率、成本和利润等指标，一交群众就受到批判，认为保守，大大地被突破了，工人提出的数字接近一千万吨，市委决定（沈阳管理局同意）今年国家计划为九百二十万吨，保证完成增产节约计划九百六十万吨，为一千万吨而奋斗。按九百六十万吨计算，比上年实际增加二百零五万吨，即增长了百分之二十七点一，一千万吨比上年实际增长百分之三十二点三。工人们认为这才像个跃进的计划。
　　二、要有跃进计划，必须要有跃进思想
    整风经验证明，整改得越彻底，工人积极性越高，生产任务完成越好。这次订计划证明，工人的积极性是高的，思想是先进的，所以出现了跃进计划。这次订计划的活生生事实，大大地教育了领导干部和工人队伍。
    在讨论计划时，工人们说：“过去英国压迫我们，现在不敢压迫我们了，反过来我们还得和他们比试比试，他们是老太太过年一年不如一年，鼓起干劲，不用十五年，有五年、十年就能把这个老笨蛋赶上。”他们又说：“今年国家计划让咱们订，这可不是打哈哈的，真得拿出点玩艺儿来看看。”工人们的口号是煤炭产量赶过煤都抚顺，效率要赶过洪山矿。就这样，大家坐在一起开诸葛亮会，当面锣，对面鼓，通过摆事实讲道理，许多以前想不到的事情群众想到了，以前发现不了的潜力群众挖出来了；许多过去认为是先进的指标，变成落后的指标了。产量、质量、成本、上缴利润、劳动效率等先进指标就这样出现了。工人们认为这次真正当家作主了，不但请我们作计划，还真按我们的意见修改计划，大大增加了他们主人翁责任感；干部们进一步认识到没有工人的先进思想，订不出来这样的跃进计划，他们进一步认识到充分发扬民主依靠群众搞好生产的重要意义；工程技术人员感到计算尺可以计算出千真万确的数目字，但计算不出工人阶级的积极性和潜力，增加了他们与工人结合搞好生产的信心。通过这一事实，我们市委也深深感到在新形势面前，领导落后于群众，认识落后于实际的官僚主义是很严重的，同时也说明了正确的集体领导，必须建筑在群众路线的基础上。有了群众的鞭策和监督，领导上才能经常保持政治敏感性，才能彻底贯彻党的方针政策，更好地实现党的决议。领导者的使命是要善于发现萌芽的新鲜事物，并支持它成长起来。只有不断的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法，才能不断地丰富提高领导，从而使革命事业不断的前进。
    以短短十八天的时间，订出来一个先进计划有什么秘密吗？没有。道理很简单，就是依靠和相信群众。领导和群众一结合，马上就发生巨大的物质力量。这次计划是工人、领导干部和工程技术人员的集体创作，所以是先进的，也是充分可靠的，当然就一定能超额完成。工人们说的好，“我们说到那里做到那里，工人阶级说话算话。”去年我们订计划，花了三个月的时间，仅上缴利润一项就反复平衡了六次才订下来。为什么这样长时间呢？这是不依靠群众，在屋子里层层讨论，这是一种脱离实际的官僚主义作法。去年和今年制订计划是两种方法，两个结果，这个经验教训是必须记取的。
　　三、乘风破浪，迎头赶上
    党中央提出十五年赶上或超过英国的号召，已经在群众中形成了巨大的力量。我们认为：这一场国际比赛，不仅是经济上的比赛，而且有着深远的政治意义，是要赛一赛哪一种政治、哪一种社会制度好。我们是劳动人民当家做主的国家，群众的智慧和创造性是无穷无尽的，只有相信和依靠群众，天大的困难也能克服，某些消极因素就会转化为积极因素。因此，我们愿意和兄弟煤矿在一起，奋勇前进，争取用五年左右的时间在煤炭产量上赶过英国。我们要虚心的学习各地领导上的先进经验，向全国和世界的先进工业水平看齐。在原煤产量上我们向煤都抚顺看齐，在劳动效率上我们向洪山矿看齐，并为赶过他们而奋斗。
    为了胜利地完成一九五八年的国家计划和增产节约计划，我们必须彻底搞好整风运动，它是推动一切工作的主要动力，只有思想上的大跃进，才有生产上的大跃进。在这里举两个例子谈谈。新丘矿五坑二十四个月未完成任务，换了五个坑长、三个总支书记、四个工程师，仍然无济于事，但是自整风开始以后，领导干部转变作风，深入现场，依靠群众，相信群众，很多生产上的重大问题解决了，群众情绪空前高涨，月月超额完成任务，由落后转变为先进了。平安三坑，领导干部每天到坑下办公，与群众同劳动、同甘苦，解决了生产重大问题，不但月月超额完成任务，该坑九段还创造了每工效率十吨煤的新纪录。平安矿去年八月间总工程师计算煤的任务完不成，提出缩减计划十多万吨，党委不同意，整风开展以后，一九五七年计划超额完成了，使他们认识到制定计划时，必须对工人群众的积极性有充分的估计。这就说明了政治思想上的跃进，就促使经济上的跃进，经济上的跃进，又反过来推动政治思想上的跃进，二者互相渗透、互相推动，这也说明了整改高潮必须与生产高潮结合前进，才能使工作成就愈来愈大。
    阜新矿务局一月份原煤生产任务已经胜利地超额三万多吨，这就给完成和超额完成今年计划造成了一个良好的开端。职工们在集中精力订计划的同时，全市各工业系统已经揭发出积压、浪费二千二百多万元，这股反浪费高潮正向深入发展。职工们纷纷表示：不赶上英国不要超额奖励；组长们表示：什么时候赶上英国再要组长津贴，群众们自觉的不要或节省劳动保护用品，全市职工已经造成一种勤俭光荣、浪费可耻的风气。打算在春节回家结婚的工人，听到党中央号召赶上英国的消息，为了多出煤，纷纷给女方写信，推迟结婚期；新结婚打算春节回家拜年的工人也不回去了。这种忘我劳动的劲头，是我们又多、又快、又好、又省地完成国家计划的可靠的保证。
    最后，再一次表示：我们一定要鼓起干劲，虚心学习兄弟厂矿的先进经验，向全国和世界工业生产水平看齐，我们决心以战斗的姿态，乘风破浪迎头赶上去。用我们生产上的大跃进，来更多、更快、更好、更省地完成第二个五年计划第一年的光荣任务，并以此作为庆祝我国第二届全国人民代表大会召开的献礼。
