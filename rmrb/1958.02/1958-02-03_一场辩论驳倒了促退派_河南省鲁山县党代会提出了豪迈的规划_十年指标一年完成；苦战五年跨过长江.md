　　A Debate Refuted the Retreatists
    The Lushan County Party Congress in Henan Province Proposed Ambitious Plans
    Ten Years of Targets Completed in One Year; Five Years of Hard Work to Cross the Yangtze River
    (Our dispatch) Zhengzhou Daily News: At the Second Congress and Second Meeting of the Chinese Communist Party in Lushan County, Henan Province held in early January, after ideological struggles, a deep criticism of right-leaning conservative thought was conducted, and four resolutions were made for a great leap forward in production. First, the slogans and goals of the great leap forward in agricultural production are: conquer nature, transform nature; grit your teeth, work hard for five years; complete ten years of targets in one year. It is required that the average grain yield per mu reach 500 jin this year; cross the Yangtze River to the south in five years, reaching a yield of 800 jin per mu in 1962. Second, strive to cure all barren hills within three years, so that under rainfall of 200 mm, water from the mountains does not flow out of the valleys, soil does not leave the mountains, and no runoff occurs on the plains. Third, this year the number of live pigs will increase from the current 82,000 to 420,000, from one pig per household to one pig per person. Fourth, vigorously develop rice production, increasing the rice planting area by another 100,000 mu from the current 25,000 mu, and basically achieving rice cultivation throughout the county within five years. To ensure the implementation of the above resolutions, the Congress also formulated various specific measures.
    When the meeting discussed the targets and measures for realizing the great leap forward in production proposed by the county party committee to the congress, a struggle between two opposing ideologies emerged. Most people believed that the targets and measures proposed by the county party committee were positive and reliable, met the requirements of the broad masses, and could be fully realized or realized ahead of schedule. Therefore, their enthusiasm was high and they were full of confidence. A portion of people expressed concern and opposition to this. For example, some people believed that mountains, barren ridges, lack of water, and insufficient fertilizer made a leap forward impossible. Some people believed that to make a leap forward, the state would have to provide loans, otherwise a leap forward could not be achieved. Some people did not believe that changing to rice cultivation could increase production, or thought that the masses had no experience and could only proceed slowly. Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas, although not openly expressing their opinions, were unconvinced in their hearts. All these ideas were hindering the realization of the great leap forward. Many representatives attending the meeting, through speeches at the congress, small group discussions, and methods of recalling and comparing, used ironclad facts to refute the various negative arguments of the retreatists.
    The meeting presented the following facts: In 1957, the average yield per mu in the county was 350 jin. However, 40 agricultural cooperatives in the county had reached or exceeded the grain targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), including 31 cooperatives with an average yield of more than 500 jin per mu, five cooperatives with more than 600 jin, three cooperatives with more than 700 jin, and one cooperative with more than 900 jin. Comrade Li Weiqing, secretary of the Zhao Village District Party Committee, cited the example of the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative, explaining that "as long as there is drive, even the most difficult places can achieve a great leap forward." The Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative is located in a place with deep mountains, steep slopes, and many stones. In 1953, the average yield per mu was 310 jin. After the transition to an advanced cooperative, due to technological reforms, production developed rapidly. In 1957, the average yield per mu was 742 jin. This cooperative recently mobilized its members to attack the old Long Mountain, which is 1,500 meters above sea level. This mountain has 25 peaks and 29 rivers and gullies, covering an area of about 5,000 mu. More than 1,000 members, encouraged by the slogan "Let the high mountains bow their heads, let the rivers give way," have completed various water conservancy projects within a short period of half a month, which can control soil and water loss over an area of more than 3,000 mu.
    Many comrades also cited various favorable conditions for developing pig production and changing to rice cultivation. All of these powerfully refuted the erroneous arguments of the retreatists, unified ideological understanding, and boosted the revolutionary enthusiasm of all the representatives.

　　一场辩论驳倒了促退派
    河南省鲁山县党代会提出了豪迈的规划
    十年指标一年完成；苦战五年跨过长江
    本报讯　河南日报消息：在1月上旬召开的中共河南省鲁山县第二届代表大会第二次会议上，经过思想论战，深刻地批判了右倾保守思想，作出了生产大跃进的四项决议。一、农业生产大跃进的口号和目标是：征服自然，改造自然；咬紧牙关，苦战五年；十年指标，一年完成。要求今年粮食平均亩产达到五百斤；五年跨过长江以南，在1962年达到亩产八百斤。二、争取三年内治好全部荒山，达到一次降雨量在二百公厘的情况下，山地水不出川，土不下山，平地不发生径流。三、今年生猪要由现有的八万二千头发展到四十二万头，由一户一猪一跃而达到一人一猪。四、大力发展水稻生产，今年水稻种植面积由现有的二万五千亩再发展十万亩，五年内全县基本上实现水稻化。为了保证实现上述决议，代表大会还制订了各项具体措施。
    会议当讨论县委向大会提出的实现生产大跃进的指标和措施的时候，出现了两种对立思想的斗争。大部分人认为县委提出的指标和措施是积极可靠的，符合广大群众的要求，完全可以实现或提前实现。因而情绪高涨，信心百倍。一部分人则对此表现了忧虑和反对。如有人认为山区、秃岭、缺水少肥，无法跃进，有人认为要跃进，国家就得贷款，不这样就跃进不了，有人不相信改种水稻能增产，或认为群众没有经验，只能慢慢来。有一些有右倾保守思想的人，虽然不公开表述自己的意见，但是内心却不通。所有这些思想，都在障碍着大跃进的实现。与会许多代表通过大会发言，小会讨论、回忆对比的方法，用铁的事实驳倒了促退派的种种消极论调。
    会议摆出了如下事实：1957年全县平均亩产三百五十斤，但是，全县已有四十个农业社达到或超过了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的粮食指标，其中平均亩产五百斤以上的三十一个社，六百斤以上的五个社，七百斤以上的三个社，九百斤以上的一个社。赵村区区委书记李维青同志举出了燎原农业社的例子，说明“只要有干劲，再困难的地方也能大跃进”。燎原农业社处于山深、坡陡、石多的地方，1953年平均亩产三百一十斤，转高级社后，由于进行了技术改革，产量得到了飞跃的发展，1957年平均亩产七百四十二斤。这个社最近又发动社员，向海拔一千五百公尺的老龙山进攻。这个山有二十五个山头，二十九条河沟，面积约五千市亩，千余名社员在“让高山低头，让河水让路”的口号鼓舞下，短短的半个月内，已完成的各种水利工程可控制水土流失面积达三千亩以上。
    很多同志还举出了各种发展生猪和改种水稻的有利条件。所有这些，有力地驳倒了促退派的错误论调，统一了思想认识，鼓起了全体代表的革命干劲。
