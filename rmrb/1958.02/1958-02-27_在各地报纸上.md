    The Ocean is a Bottomless Fertilizer Reservoir
    The Fujian Daily on the 21st featured a front-page headline: "The Ocean is a Bottomless Fertilizer Reservoir." Lianjiang County is about to mobilize thousands of people to launch a sea fertilizer accumulation campaign. The news stated: In order to achieve a great leap forward in agriculture this year, Lianjiang County is organizing fishery cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and the masses to vigorously develop ocean fertilizers. Sources of sea fertilizer include rotten fish and shrimp, black algae, seaweed, kelp residue, and brine from processing fish and shrimp. Some of these fertilizers are several times more effective than human manure. One dan (approximately 50 kg) of rotten fish and shrimp is equivalent to the fertilizing effect of six or seven dan of human manure. The County Committee plans to further investigate and research to develop sea fertilizer resources on a larger scale.

    Future "Land of Fish and Rice"
    Shandong, traditionally known as a "northern dryland grain area," will become a "land of fish and rice" like the Jiangnan region in the near future. This is the good news brought by the Dazhong Daily on the 25th. The newspaper reported that the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee recently jointly convened a rice production work conference. The conference was attended by leading cadres from special districts and counties, as well as agricultural experts and rice production experts. After discussions and exchanges at the meeting, and after the delegates visited Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei and other provinces, everyone was full of confidence in developing rice production. The meeting proposed: focus on experiments this year, fully implement next year, and expand rice fields to 20 to 40 million mu by 1962. This will rapidly increase grain production in Shandong Province. The newspaper published an editorial on this. The second page also organized a special page to introduce the successful experiences of rice cultivation in some areas of the province.

    Eliminating Third-Class Wheat Fields
    According to the Xinhua Daily on the 24th, Binhai County recently launched a "Shock Week to Eliminate Third-Class Wheat Fields." Third-class wheat production accounts for more than one-third of Binhai County's total annual grain output. However, there are still 200,000 mu of third-class wheat in the county that are not growing well and urgently need cultivation to achieve a bumper harvest on every mu. Recently, the CPC Binhai County Committee transferred 70% of the county-level government cadres to the countryside to cooperate with district and township cadres in leading the intensive cultivation of third-class wheat fields. On average, each agricultural cooperative has four cadres. It is expected that the 200,000 mu of third-class wheat fields can be eliminated within five days.

    What Kind of Production Materials are Needed
    The great leap forward in agricultural production will inevitably promote a great leap forward in the supply of production materials. A news item on the second page of the Hunan Daily on the 24th reflects the characteristics of this spring's urgent and large demand for production materials. The news stated: Many agricultural cooperatives in Xiangtan Special District and Hengshan County transplanted rice seedlings a season earlier than in previous years, and the area of ​​double cropping and double-season rice has more than doubled compared with last year. At the same time, due to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline industries, there is an urgent and large demand for production materials such as lime, fertilizers, and farm tools, requiring relevant departments to supply them in various ways.

    Vehicles Go to the Countryside to Support Spring Ploughing
    The Shenyang Daily reported on the front page of the 24th: The Shenyang Municipal Economic Commission decided to mobilize all organs, groups, schools, and enterprises in the city that have vehicles to allocate some of their vehicles to support the suburban agricultural cooperatives in accumulating fertilizer. According to this decision, from the Spring Festival to March 10, more than 1,000 cars and carts in the city will go to the countryside to transport fertilizer, accumulating 3,000 workdays. The Shenyang garrison has also allocated 50 cars to support the countryside for three days. Currently, spring is approaching and there is a shortage of vehicles in the suburbs, and spring plowing is imminent. If fertilizer is not actively transported, it will affect the completion of this year's agricultural production plan. This measure taken by Shenyang City not only timely supports agriculture, but also further strengthens urban-rural relations.

    Construction Engineering School Undertakes Contracts
    The Hubei Daily on the 24th reported on the deeds of work-study programs in some vocational schools in the Wuhan area. The report on the Wuchang Construction Engineering School is the most eye-catching. In addition to accepting a quarrying task of 20,000 cubic meters, they are also preparing to contract engineering tasks worth 600,000 yuan. The Central South Construction Engineering Bureau has decided to hand over the construction of dormitories for the Central South Institute for Nationalities, the Wuhan Branch of the Academy of Sciences, and the warehouse of the Provincial People's Committee to them. They are striving to achieve the goal of "self-sufficiency in funding within one year."

    Saving 300,000 Yuan from Drawings
    The Xi'an Daily reported on the 24th: In the upsurge of anti-waste airing of views, employees of the Xi'an Municipal Design Institute actively inspect engineering projects that have been designed and drawn but have not yet been constructed or are under construction, striving to rescue and save money before the drawings cause waste. In just one week of preliminary inspection, many problems were discovered in the drawings of 51 sub-projects of 40 capital construction units. After preliminary research and estimation, it is estimated that these drawings can save the country 300,000 yuan after modification.

    海洋是无底的肥料库
    21日的福建日报一版头条报道了一件新鲜新闻：海洋是无底的肥料库。连江县即将组织千军万马掀起积海肥运动。消息中说：连江县为了实现今年农业大跃进，组织渔业社、农业社和群众大力开发海洋肥料。海肥来源有臭鱼烂虾、乌?、海?、苔菜渣和加工鱼虾的卤水。这些肥效有的比人粪尿还要高几倍。一担臭鱼虾，相当六七担人粪尿的肥效。县委准备进一步调查研究，以便更大规模地开发海肥资源。
    未来的“鱼米之乡”
    一向被称作“北方旱作杂粮区”的山东，在不远的将来，将成为和江南一样的“鱼米之乡”。这是25日的大众日报带给人们的好消息。报纸报道，最近中共山东省委和山东省人民委员会联合召开了一次水稻生产工作会议。参加会议的有专区和县的负责干部，也有农业专家和水稻生产能手。经过会议的座谈讨论，经过与会代表到安徽、江苏、河北等省的参观，大家对发展水稻充满信心。会议提出：今年重点试验，明年全面展开，1962年水稻田将发展到二千至四千万亩。这将使得山东省的粮食产量迅速增加。报纸为此发表了社论。在第二版并组织了专页，介绍本省某些地区种植水稻的成功经验。
    消灭三类麦田
    据新华日报24日报道，滨海县最近开展了一个消灭三类麦田突击周。三麦产量占滨海县全年粮食总产量的三分之一以上。但全县还有二十万亩三麦生长不旺，极需加工培植，才能做到三麦亩亩丰收。最近中共滨海县委抽调了70％的县级机关干部下乡，配合区、乡干部，参加领导三类麦田的突击培植。平均每个农业社都有四个干部。预计五天内就可将二十万亩三类麦田消灭。
    需要什么样的生产资料
    农业生产的大跃进，必然要促使生产资料供应工作的大跃进。24日湖南日报二版上的一条消息，反映了今春需要生产资料又多又急的特点。消息中说：湘潭专区和衡山县的许多农业社，比往年提早了一个季节插秧，复种面积和双季稻都比去年扩大了一倍多，同时由于农、林、渔、牧、副业等的全面发展，因此，需要石灰、肥料、农具等生产资料急而多，要求有关部门多方供应。
    车辆下乡支援春耕
    24日沈阳日报一版报道：沈阳市经济委员会决定动员全市各机关、团体、学校、企业凡有车辆的单位，都抽出一部分车辆去支援郊区农业社积肥。根据这个决定，从春节到3月10日，全市将有一千辆以上的汽车、大车下乡运送肥料，累计可有三千个劳动日。沈阳驻军也已拨出五十辆汽车，准备下乡支援三天。目前春化将至、郊区车马不足，春耕又已迫近，如不积极送肥将影响今年农业生产计划的完成，沈阳市采取这一措施，不仅及时支援了农业，还将进一步密切城乡关系。
    建筑工程学校承包
    24日湖北日报一版上集中地报道了武汉地区一些专业学校勤工俭学的事迹。关于武昌建筑工程学校的报道最引人注意，他们目前除接受二万方的采石任务外，还准备承包价值六十万元的工程任务。中南建筑工程局已决定将中南民族学院、科学院武汉分院的宿舍和省人民委员会的仓库交给他们建造。他们正为“一年内实现经费自给自足”的目标而奋斗。
    从图纸上节约三十万元
    24日西安日报报道：西安市设计院职工在反浪费鸣放高潮中，积极检查设计出图纸而尚未施工或正在施工的工程，力争在图纸未造成浪费事实前，抢救节约。仅一周来的初步检查，就从四十个基建单位的五十一个分项工程的图纸上，发现了不少问题。经初步研究估算，这些图纸修改后可为国家节约三十万元。
