    Also a Meaningless Dispute

    The American garrison and the Japanese local authorities have also had a dispute over a small matter. Austin, the provost marshal of the U.S. Air Force base in Japan, does not allow the Japanese side to charge U.S. military personnel admission fees for playing golf, on the grounds that U.S. military personnel are playing golf in Japan to "maintain physical standards," which is "official business."
    The arrogance and unreasonableness of this American provost marshal is obvious. The question is, the Japanese government has opened the door of the country to the American occupiers without charging any admission fees. Why bother about such a small piece of land on the golf course? If the Japanese government, according to the wishes of the Japanese people, let the U.S. garrison withdraw, the benefits to be gained will be far more than just being spared a lot of annoyance!

    也是无谓的纠纷
    美国驻军和日本的地方当局在一个小问题上也发生了纠纷。美国驻日本约翰逊空军基地的宪兵司令奥斯汀不许日本方面向美军人员收取打高尔夫球的入场费，理由是美军人员在日本打高尔夫球是为了“保持体格标准”，属于“公务”。
    这个美国宪兵司令的蛮横无理是显而易见的。问题是，日本政府把国家的大门都为美国占领者敞开，而不收什么入场费，又何必在高尔夫球场这一小块地方上斤斤计较呢？如果日本政府按照日本人民的愿望，让美国驻军撤走，那末将会得到的好处，何止是少受许多闲气而已？
