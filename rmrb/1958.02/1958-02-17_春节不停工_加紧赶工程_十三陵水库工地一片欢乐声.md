Spring Festival Without Stopping Work, Speeding Up Construction
    The Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site is Filled with Joyful Sounds

    (Our report) News from the paper: During the Spring Festival, the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site in Changping District, Beijing, was seething with joyful labor songs. This reservoir, with a storage capacity of 66 million tons, can irrigate 250,000 to 300,000 mu of land. In order to complete the project before the flood season, more than 25,400 people are currently working day and night. Those participating in the reservoir construction include migrant workers, soldiers, students, government cadres, and commercial employees. They proposed and realized the slogan "Spring Festival without stopping work, speeding up construction." After the Sujiatuo Youth Shock Brigade issued a challenge to all the migrant workers participating in the reservoir construction to not go home for the Spring Festival, various migrant worker teams responded enthusiastically. Tang Chenshi from Songlanpu Township is fifty-six years old this year and participated in the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction project with her son. The mother and son had already discussed spending a happy year of great leap forward at the reservoir construction site. All ninety-eight female members of the Female Youth Shock Brigade wrote letters of determination not to go home for the Spring Festival. Many people also wrote letters home, telling their families to rest assured and that they would reunite at home after the reservoir was completed.

    More than 15,000 cadres from central government departments, middle school students, and soldiers participating in voluntary labor also spent the Spring Festival together with the migrant workers at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site. More than 130 workers from the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory did not rest during their Spring Festival holiday, instead using their vacation to repair the reservoir at the Ming Tombs. Cadres from the Changping District level organs contributed more than 500 yuan saved from their own pockets to buy vegetables and other gifts to the construction site to comfort all the migrant workers and celebrate this unforgettable Spring Festival with them.
