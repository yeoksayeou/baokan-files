A Space for Everyone to Care for Transferred Cadres

　　Transferred Cadres Should Contribute to the "Forty Articles"!
　　Zhi Meng
    Under the call of the Party and the state to "go to the countryside and up to the mountains to participate in labor training," tens of thousands of intellectuals and government officials are rushing to the agricultural front. This revolutionary action will bring about tremendous changes in all aspects.
    Our country is currently in an era of great change. Encouraged by the "Forty Articles" of the National Agricultural Development Program, the broad masses of farmers are carrying out earth-shaking great construction with unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity. This large army of intellectuals marching towards the countryside and mountainous areas, participating in this great struggle, will not only transform themselves, but also accelerate the transformation of the countryside. This is truly a great action to transform oneself, transform nature, and transform history!
    Going to the countryside and up to the mountains, engaging in labor training, and transforming oneself – it is certainly good for every transferred comrade to go down with this purpose. However, can we further consider this question: What will I do for the "Forty Articles" during my period of transferred labor?
    Why raise such a question? As everyone knows, the "Forty Articles" of the National Agricultural Development Program is a struggle program for rapidly developing China's agricultural productive forces, strengthening socialist industrialization, and improving the living standards of farmers and all the people. It is a great program for building a prosperous and happy new socialist countryside. Contributing to the "Forty Articles" and striving to achieve this program ahead of schedule should be said to be the responsibility of everyone.
    After cadres and intellectuals go down, of course, the first thing is to labor and learn from the peasants, but it should not be limited to this. Although cadres and intellectuals are inferior to peasants in many ways, they are still stronger than peasants in terms of cultural knowledge. Moreover, most of the cadres sent down for training this time are relatively outstanding key members. After such a team goes to the countryside, they should, in addition to their own labor training, use their strengths to help the countryside do some things, use their knowledge and culture, or science and technology, to contribute to agricultural production and construction and the transformation of the countryside, and contribute to the realization of the "Forty Articles." This helps the peasants and also trains themselves.
    For example, if the village where you are located has not yet conducted a good publicity discussion on the "Forty Articles," you should help the local grassroots cadres to have a good discussion and study, so that everyone can recognize the direction and strengthen their confidence. At the same time, during the discussion process, you will inevitably understand many situations and problems in the local area. For example, if the local farmers encounter difficulties in agricultural knowledge and technology during the production leap forward, you should actively participate, conduct joint research with them, improve understanding, encourage them, support them, help them think of various ways to overcome the difficulties in the way forward, or introduce advanced experiences from other places to break through the obstacles to progress.
    Another example, if the village where you are located is not active in carrying out the elimination of the four pests and farmers lack sanitary habits, then you should patiently persuade and educate them, let them understand the harm of the four pests, and help them jointly think of ways to launch the sanitation campaign, instead of you being dirty and me just taking care of my labor. …
    Saying here that we should contribute to the "Forty Articles" does not mean that the transferred cadres should leave labor training to become cadres (except for those assigned to work at the grassroots level), nor is it to stand on the heads of the masses and point fingers in a self-righteous manner. What is discussed here is mainly the issue of attitude toward going down for training. It is understood that there are two different attitudes among the cadres who are sent down for labor: one type of person clenches their teeth, picks up the hoe, becomes a peasant during the day, and an intellectual at night. Calluses have grown on their hands, but they are out of sync with the peasants in their hearts, indifferent to the joys and sorrows of the peasants, and have no interest in rural affairs. These people lack awareness of going to the countryside for training, and they believe that labor is a general trend that they have to do. Such people are, of course, a very small minority. Another type of person goes down consciously, they are full of enthusiasm and vitality, they are eager to learn from the working people, earnestly labor to transform themselves, and at the same time, they show deep concern for the sufferings and future happiness of the working people. Therefore, their labor is pleasant, and they are also concerned about the issues that the peasants are concerned about. In addition to labor, they also help the peasants solve various problems. This attitude is correct and is also the attitude adopted by most of our transferred cadres.
    Our poor and ancient countryside is transforming, and the "Forty Articles" are gradually becoming a reality. When our term of transferred training is over and we return victoriously, when we see the new countryside growing up, the transferred comrades can proudly say: "I have contributed to the realization of the Forty Articles there!"

### 下放干部要为“四十条”出力！

专栏：大家都来关怀下放干部

　　下放干部要为“四十条”出力！
　　之梦
    在党和国家“下乡上山参加劳动锻炼”的号召下，成千上万的知识分子和机关干部争先恐后地奔赴农业前线。这一革命行动，将在各方面引起巨大的变化。
    目前我国正处在一个伟大变革的时代，广大农民在全国农业发展纲要四十条的鼓舞下，正以前所未有的热情和创造性，进行着翻天复地的大建设，这一支向农村向山区进发的知识分子大军，参加到这个伟大的斗争行列中来，不仅使自己得到改造，同时也将促使农村面貌加速改变。这实在是一个改造自己，改造自然，改造历史的伟大的行动！
    下乡上山，劳动锻炼，改造自己，每一个下放的同志，抱着这样的目的下去当然很好。但是，可不可以再进一步考虑这样一个问题：下放劳动期间我将为“四十条”作些什么？
    为什么要提出这样一个问题呢？大家知道，农业发展纲要四十条是迅速发展我国农业生产力，加强社会主义工业化，提高农民以及全体人民生活水平的一个斗争纲领，是一个建设社会主义的繁荣幸福的新农村的伟大纲领，为“四十条”出力，争取提前实现这一纲领，应该说是人人有责。
    干部、知识分子下去之后，当然首先是劳动，向农民学习，但也不应仅限于此。干部、知识分子，尽管有许多地方不如农民，而在文化知识方面还是比农民强些，而且这次下放锻炼的干部中，多数都是比较优秀的骨干分子，这样一支队伍下到农村之后，就应该在自己劳动锻炼之余，以己之长，帮助农村做一些事情，用自己的知识和文化，或是科学和技术，为农业生产建设和农村面貌的变化出一些力，为“四十条”的实现出一些力，这一方面帮助了农民，同时也锻炼了自己。
    比方说，你所在的村庄对“四十条”还没有很好进行宣传讨论，你就应该帮助当地基层干部好好讨论学习，使大家认清方向，坚定信心；同时在讨论过程中，自己也必然会了解到当地的许多情况和问题。比方说，当地农民在生产跃进中碰到了农业知识和技术方面的困难，自己就应该积极参加进去，和他们一道共同研究，提高认识，鼓舞他们，支持他们，帮助他们想各种办法，克服前进中的困难，或是为他们介绍外地的先进经验，打破前进的障碍。
    又比方说，你所在的村庄对开展除四害不积极，农民缺乏卫生习惯，那你就要耐心地说服教育，让他们了解四害之危害，并帮助他们共同想办法把卫生运动开展起来，而不是你脏你的，我只管劳动我的。……
    这里说要为“四十条”出力，并不是要下放干部离开劳动锻炼去当干部（分配作基层工作的例外），更不是要自以为是地站在群众头上指手划脚说东说西，这里所谈的主要是下去锻炼的态度问题。据了解，下放劳动的干部有这样两种不同的态度：一种人是咬紧牙关，拿起镢头，白天当农民，晚上当知识分子，手上也磨出了老茧，心上和农民格格不入，对农民的苦乐漠不关心，对农村的事情毫无兴趣。这种人下乡锻炼是缺乏自觉性的，劳动在他们认为是大势所趋不得不如此。这种人当然是很少数。另有一种人下去是自觉的，他们满腔热情，生气勃勃，他们迫切要求向劳动人民学习，认真劳动改造自己，同时，对劳动人民的生活疾苦和前途幸福也表现深切的关怀，因而他们的劳动是愉快的，他们对农民关心的问题也很关心，他们在劳动之余还要帮农民解决这样那样的问题。这样的态度是正确的，也是我们多数下放干部所采取的态度。
    我们贫穷而古老的农村正在蜕变，“四十条”正在逐步变成现实，当我们下放锻炼期满胜利归来的时候，当我们看到新农村成长起来的时候，下放的同志可以自豪地说：“我曾为那里四十条的实现出过力！”
