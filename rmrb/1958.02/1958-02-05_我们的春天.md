　　Our Spring
　　Cao Yu
　　Flipping through the calendar, the Beginning of Spring is at 15:50 this afternoon. It seems to say that, at this moment, the breath of spring begins to show its eyebrows and eyes on the land. All things will grow, and all living things will feel an indescribable warmth descending upon their hearts.
　　In fact, the feeling of spring has come especially early this year.
　　Two months ago, on a snowy night, under the bright oil lamp in a small team headquarters of the Tangshan Agricultural Cooperative, I clearly saw the footprints of spring. The two earthen rooms were filled with people, old and young women sitting around a roaring coal fire on the kang, happily learning to read. The short, sharp, and capable team leader wrote "Spring, Divert Water, Open Rice Fields" on the blackboard. They learned to write stroke by stroke. A blackboard was also hung on the earthen wall next door, and several young farmers who had graduated from junior high school were studying abacus with some old farmers. It was extremely quiet, the snow pattered on the window paper, and outside the window, you could occasionally hear the old feeder, Wang Delu, feeding in the pen, coaxing the livestock in a low voice. Zhang Lanying, sitting near the base of the wall, could even hear the sound of her favorite ox, "Qinghua," chewing feed in the livestock pen.
　　Everyone was excited to dig and carry fertilizer in "Xihukeng" as soon as it was light, transporting carts of black gold-like fertilizer to the wintering wheat fields. Now it was 9 o'clock at night, and everyone's face—men, women, old, and young—was still ruddy, without a trace of fatigue. After finishing their studies, everyone asked to discuss the forty-article program for agriculture. It was like a spring thunder rising from the ground, and no one would have thought that such a quiet little house would suddenly boil over. When discussing the planting of various high-yield crops and raising the per-mu yield targets, everyone chimed in, sharing planting experiences and finding tricks to improve the targets. The old men and young people all gave thumbs up, "Four hundred catties! Four hundred and fifty catties! Five hundred catties!" They argued over one number after another, and finally, everyone enthusiastically guaranteed, saying, "Crossing the Yellow River is no problem! We will also cross the Yangtze River, bringing our own travel expenses, without the government spending an extra penny for us!"
　　After the socialist debate, the farmers in the cooperative were full of energy, and everyone saw clearly the happy socialist road, full of heroic spirit.
　　The meeting broke up, and everyone walked out bustlingly. The cold snowflakes fell on their hot faces, and the snow was already half a foot thick. People stepped on the snow, making a rustling sound. Hao Chunhe, in high spirits, rushed to my side and shouted, "Old Cao, do you think the energy is enough! Let me tell you, this is just the beginning!"
　　At this moment, I suddenly saw several young farmers wearing large cotton coats climbing on ladders by the roadside, the light of flashlights flickering under the eaves, chattering, laughing, and talking. It turned out that they were taking advantage of the snowy night to catch sparrows. The snow fell even harder, and Hao Chunhe and I walked quietly forward, facing the pleasant snowflakes. He suddenly said:
　　"Don't think it's quiet right now. But right now, farmers all over China are holding meetings, preparing to welcome the bumper harvest of 1958." He smiled, and then said to me, "The whole commune will start digging the big canal the day after tomorrow. Do you think there's energy or not!"
　　At this moment, around me, it was no longer a cold and snowy night. I suddenly saw an ocean of millions of lights. Under the bright lights, farmers all over China were beaming with joy, heading towards a prosperous and wealthy socialism with full confidence.
　　At this moment, I deeply felt that the feeling of spring was permeating, and the hearts of all Chinese people were warm.
　　Hundreds of millions of farmers have already started a winter upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction, and nearly 100 million people in rural areas are marching towards nature every day. I saw a drop in the ocean—the Tangshan Cooperative was also enthusiastically digging canals. The weather suddenly turned cold, and the temperature dropped to minus twenty degrees. The north wind howled, and the sun shone on the canal-digging area of Mafang Village. Countless farmers were raising their pickaxes, breaking frozen clods of earth; they were digging canals, carrying soil, ramming, and building weirs, each one as lively as a dragon and as agile as a swallow. Ice froze on people's eyebrows and beards. The weather was really cold, but an old farmer in his sixties was still unwilling to admit defeat, rushing to dig soil and carry baskets with the young men. Everyone advised him to come down, but he squinted and smiled, saying, "I still want to lay the foundation for socialism."
　　Among this group of people fighting against nature, there were also people from all walks of life in the town. For a time, there were sewing stations, shoe repair stations, medical stations, propaganda stations, boiling water stations, and broadcasting stations on the dam; if clothes were torn, someone would sew them, if shoes were broken, someone would repair them, and if someone was injured, a doctor would treat them. There were also many intellectuals and transferred cadres from the city participating in the labor. They raised their pickaxes and worked with the farmers to dig up large chunks of frozen soil, with full and happy expressions. From the farmers' loving eyes, it could be seen that they had undergone a tremendous change. With the up and down movement of the pickaxes, their sweat fell on the land. This made people feel that Chinese intellectuals were also welcoming the spring with the farmers in a down-to-earth manner.
　　Today, the feeling of spring is rippling in everyone's heart. At the National People's Congress in Huairentang, everyone's mood was relaxed. After listening to the report on the 1958 national budget and the report on the national economy, everyone was filled with unspeakable joy and excitement. The brilliant achievements of the first Five-Year Plan truly made people feel "spring is all over the garden, and the atmosphere is ever-changing."
　　Everything is leaping forward, and we are doing great and unprecedented things. We will change the face of the countryside in three years, and catch up with or surpass England in heavy industry in fifteen years. We have already begun the second Five-Year Plan. 1958 is the first year of a new battle.
　　This is a bright spring, an extraordinary spring, a spring full of hope, because our great "hopeful" nation has fully awakened.

　　我们的春天
　　曹禺
    翻开日历，今天下午十五时五十分立春。这似乎说，一到了这个时刻，春气就在土地上开始露出她的眉眼。万物将要滋生，一切生物都会感到心头上降临了一股不可言传的温暖。
    其实，今年的春意来得特别早。
    两月前，一个大雪纷飞之夜，我在汤山农业合作社一个小队部里明亮的油灯下，便分明看见春天的足迹。两间土屋里坐满了人，老老少少的妇女们围着一炉旺旺的煤火坐在炕头上，笑嘻嘻地在识字。短小精干的小队长在黑板上写着“春天，引水，开稻地。”她们一笔一划地学着写。隔壁土墙上也挂着黑板，几个高小毕业的青年农民正和一些老农研究珠算。静极了，雪叮叮地洒在窗纸上，窗外偶尔听得见老饲养员王德禄正在圈里喂料，低声呵弄着牲口。靠近墙根坐着的张兰英，都听得见牲口圈里她顶喜欢的牡牛——“青花”嚼料的声音。
    大家从一见亮就兴高采烈地在“西湖坑”里挖肥、抬肥，把一车一车黑金似的肥泥运到麦种正在冬眠的地里。现在夜间九点钟了，每个人——男女老少的脸上还是红朴朴的，没有一点倦意。学习完毕，大家都要求讨论、讨论农业四十条纲要。真是春雷一声平地起，谁也不会想到这样安静的小屋里顿时沸腾起来。讨论起多种高产作物，提高亩产量指标的时候，大家你一言我一语，纷纷谈出种植经验，找窍门提高指标。老头儿和年青人都竖起大拇指，“四百斤！四百五十斤！五百斤！”一个数字、一个数字争论着，最后大家热烈保证，说“跨黄河，没问题！我们还要过长江，自带路费，不要政府多为我们用一个钱！”
    社会主义大辩论以后，合作社里，个个农民的干劲足，人人都看清了幸福的社会主义道路，充满了英雄气概。
    会散了，大家热热闹闹地走出来，冰冷的雪花落在热烘烘的脸上，雪已下了半尺厚了。人们踏在雪上发出沙沙的响声。兴致勃勃的郝春和赶到我身旁，大声嚷着，“老曹，你看劲头足不足！告诉你，这才是刚开头！”
    这时我忽然看见在路边上有几个青年农民披着大棉袄，爬在梯子上，手电筒的光在屋檐下闪来闪去，叽叽喳喳又笑又说。原来他们是乘着雪夜在捉麻雀呢。雪落得更大了，我和郝春和迎着快意的雪花向前静静地走着，他忽然说：
    “你别瞧这会儿一点声音都没有。可就在这会儿，全中国的农民都在开会，准备迎接1958年大丰收呢。”他笑了，接着对我说，“全社后天就要开大渠了，你看有劲没劲！”
    这时，在我周围，已不是一个严寒的冰雪之夜，眼前忽然看见千百万盏灯火的海洋。明亮的灯光下，全中国的农民喜气洋洋，满怀信心地正奔向丰饶富裕的社会主义。
    这时，我深深感到春意弥漫，全中国人民的心头上是温暖的。
    亿万农民群众，已经掀起了冬令兴修农田水利的热潮，农村中每天有近亿的人口向自然大进军。我看见大海中的一滴——汤山合作社也热火朝天地在开渠。天气突然冷起来，气温降到零下二十度。北风呼呼地刮着，阳光照在马房村的开渠地带。数不尽的农民群众举着洋镐，敲碎冰冻的土块；他们挖渠、抬土、打夯、筑堰，一个个生龙活虎，矫健如飞。冰凌冻结在人们的眉毛和胡须上，天气真冷，但是有一位六十多岁的老农民还不甘服老，抢着和小伙子们一同挖土抬筐，大家都劝他下来，他眯?着眼笑着说，“我还要为社会主义打基础呢。”
    在这群向大自然斗争的人里，还有来自镇上各行各业的人们。一时，堤上有了缝衣站、补鞋站、医疗站、宣传站、开水站、广播站；衣服破了有人缝，鞋破了有人补，碰伤了有医生治。这里还有许多从城里来的知识分子和下放干部，也在参加劳动。他们举着洋镐和农民们把一大块、一大块的冻土刨下来，神情饱满愉快。从农民那样喜欢他们的眼神里，看得出他们已经有了一个巨大的变化。随着洋镐的上下，他们的汗水落在土地上。这使人感觉中国的知识分子也和农民一道脚踏实地的迎接到了春天。
    今天春意荡漾在每个人的心里。在怀仁堂的人民代表大会上，个个人的心情舒畅。听了1958年国家预算的报告和国民经济的报告，大家都是说不出的欢欣鼓舞。第一个五年计划的辉煌成就，真是使人感到“春色满园，气象万千”。
    一切都在大跃进，我们正在干着伟大的前无古人的事情。我们要在三年内改变农村面貌，十五年后在重工业上赶上英国或者超过英国。我们已经开始了第二个五年计划。1958年是新的战斗的头一年。
    这是一个明媚的春天，一个不平凡的春天，是一个一切都大有希望的春天，因为我们这个伟大的“大有希望”的民族已经完全觉醒起来了。
  1958年立春日
