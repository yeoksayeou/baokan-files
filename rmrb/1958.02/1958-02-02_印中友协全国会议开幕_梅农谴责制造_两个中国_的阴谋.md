Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, February 1st: The Third All-China Conference of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association opened here on January 31st. The conference was presided over by the chairman of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, Sundarlal. Indian Defense Minister Menon delivered the opening speech, in which he condemned the absurd proposition of so-called "two Chinas."

More than 5,000 people attended the opening meeting, including representatives from various branches of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association across the country, as well as the president of the Bombay State Congress Party, Shah, the president of the Indian-Soviet Cultural Society, Dr. Baliga, and people from all walks of life. Personnel from the consulates and commercial representatives of socialist countries in Bombay also attended the meeting.

In his opening speech, Menon called for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. He emphasized that it is necessary and wise to recognize the facts and give China its international status, which is, in any case, China's inherent right. He said that China is in the United Nations, but the person representing it there is not the one who should be there.

Menon exposed the idea of "two Chinas," considering it utterly absurd. He pointed out that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

Menon also called on all countries in the world to abandon the use of nuclear weapons, atomic warheads, and hydrogen bombs. He said that if humanity is to continue to live, war must be prohibited.

The head of the delegation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, Ding Xilin, presented a banner to the conference on behalf of the association. The banner read: "May Sino-Indian friendship last forever." He said that the Sino-Indian Friendship Association has made great contributions to promoting the traditional friendship between the two countries. He added that we, together with our Indian friends, are very proud to be able to shoulder the glorious task of safeguarding world peace.

Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili, in his speech, expressed his heartfelt respect to those Indian friends who are dedicated to the cause of Sino-Indian friendship. He said that the Indian government and people have always supported China's legitimate status in international affairs and opposed the conspiracy to create two Chinas. We, the Chinese people, sincerely thank India for this friendly and just action.

The three committees of the conference will separately discuss "Sino-Indian Friendship as a Factor for World Peace," "Sino-Indian Cultural Relations," and "Organizational Issues" tomorrow.

　　印中友协全国会议开幕
    梅农谴责制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    据新华社孟买1日电　印中友好协会第三届全国会议1月31日在这里开幕。会议由印中友好协会主席森德拉尔主持。印度国防部长梅农在会上致开幕词，他谴责了所谓“两个中国”的荒谬主张。
    五千多人参加了开幕会议，其中除了印中友好协会全国各地分会的代表以外，还有孟买邦国大党主席沙阿、印苏文化协会主席巴利加博士和各阶层人士。社会主义国家驻孟买的领事馆人员和商务代表也出席了会议。
    梅农在致开幕词时要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。他强调说，承认事实并且给予中国以国际地位——那无论如何是中国固有的权利——是必要的，而且是明智的。他说，中国是在联合国之中，但是代表它坐在那里的却不是理应坐在那里的人。
    梅农揭穿了关于“两个中国”的主张，认为这是荒谬透顶的。他指出，台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分。
    梅农还呼吁世界各国放弃使用核武器、原子弹头和氢弹。他说，如果人类要继续活下去，就必须禁止战争。
    中印友好协会代表团团长丁西林代表协会向会议献旗。旗上写着“愿中印友谊万古常青”。他说，印中友好协会在促进两国之间传统的友谊方面作出了巨大的贡献。他又说，我们同印度朋友一起，以能够担负起保卫世界和平的光荣任务而感到非常自豪。
    中国驻印度大使潘自力在致词时对那些致力于中印友好事业的印度友人表示衷心的敬意。他说，印度政府和人民始终支持中国在国际事务中的合法地位和反对制造两个中国的阴谋。我们中国人民衷心感谢印度这种友好的和正义的行动。
    会议的三个委员会将在明天分别讨论“作为世界和平因素的印中友好”、“印中文化关系”和“组织问题”。
