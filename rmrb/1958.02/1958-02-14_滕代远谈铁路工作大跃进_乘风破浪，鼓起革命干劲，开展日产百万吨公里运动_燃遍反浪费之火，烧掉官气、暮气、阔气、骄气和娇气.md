Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 13th: At the closing session of the Beijing Railway Administration's conference of advanced producers and worker representatives on the 11th, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan called on railway workers across the country to ride the waves, arouse revolutionary drive, launch a movement to produce one million ton-kilometers per day, and strive to oppose waste, oppose conservatism, and implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Teng Daiyuan first pointed out that the Beijing Railway Administration's conference of advanced producers and worker representatives was a great success. At this meeting, various advanced experiences were summarized and exchanged. The representatives had great revolutionary drive and high spirits. The Administration's plans, targets, and quotas were repeatedly broken through after everyone's discussion: this year's daily ton-kilometer target was increased by 33.3% compared to last year; the number of cars loaded was increased by 13.7% compared to last year's plan; the coal saving target was increased from 5,000 tons to 80,000 tons; and this year's increased production and savings will amount to 80 million yuan. Other technical indicators such as average train weight, locomotive daily car kilometers, technical speed, and travel speed have all improved compared to last year, and transfer time and stopover time have been shortened. Recently, some unreasonable provisions in the Ministry of Railways' regulations on locomotive overhauls, vehicle maintenance, and building maintenance were also broken through first. All these vigorous mass revolutionary sentiments herald the beginning of a great leap forward in railway work, and this wave of the great leap forward has begun first in the Beijing Bureau.

Teng Daiyuan then said that under the encouragement of one victory after another, the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for production and construction is unprecedentedly high. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the railway sector also achieved brilliant achievements during the first Five-Year Plan. In order to adapt to the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our country, we will build more new railways during the second Five-Year Plan, with the southwest and northwest as the center, extending the railways to the vast hinterland of our country, connecting remote areas such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Guizhou with the inland by railways, and helping all fraternal ethnic groups develop their economies and cultures. In order to change the state of technological backwardness, new technologies will be adopted as much as possible in construction and transportation work during the second Five-Year Plan. The magnificent prospects for railway development are encouraging all railway workers to strive to overfulfill the second Five-Year Plan.

Teng Daiyuan pointed out that railway workers across the country have now universally ignited the torch of anti-waste. This fire will not only economically burn away all wasteful phenomena, but also thoroughly burn away bureaucratic airs, morbid airs, extravagant airs, arrogant airs, and squeamish airs politically and ideologically. This fire is an important part of the rectification campaign and is a socialist revolution in politics and ideology. The anti-waste movement now underway on railways across the country is a central link in our current work. Railway workers across the country must use anti-waste to make our work leap forward.

Teng Daiyuan focused on the issue of carrying out the advanced producer movement. He said that the purpose of our advanced producer movement is to require the backward to learn from the advanced, and to require the advanced to become more advanced, using this method to constantly break old quotas and constantly create new quotas. This method is the main way to fully tap potential strength. Therefore, in essence, it is also the main method of opposing waste and practicing thrift. Take the Beijing Bureau as an example. According to the 1957 statistics, among the national railway administrations, the workload was second, second only to the Shenyang Bureau. The cost, labor productivity, and profits turned over to the state were the first, which is good. Last year, in terms of transporting empty cars, the spirit of socialist cooperation was fully demonstrated, and even sacrificing their own car loading to ensure the emptying to the Taiyuan Bureau, which is also good. These are the advanced things, and we must strive to make them more advanced. However, in some indicators, the position of the Beijing Bureau is not so high. For example, in the movement of one million ton-kilometers per day per locomotive, last year each locomotive, including small operations, only completed 588,500 ton-kilometers, ranking fifth, behind Shanghai, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Jinan. Last year, the coal consumption per 10,000 ton-kilometers of locomotives was 128.1 kilograms, ranking fifth in the country, still not catching up with bureaus such as Jinzhou and Shanghai. Particularly serious are traffic accidents, with the Beijing Bureau being the second most serious railway bureau in the country in terms of accidents. The purpose of listing these indicators is to illustrate that the potential of the Beijing Bureau is still very large. Sections and sections, stations and stations, factories and factories, and even one locomotive and one locomotive, one lathe and one lathe, and individuals can compare with each other. Although some indicators are not comparable due to different conditions, it is also beneficial to compare. Regularly comparing advanced indicators can supervise oneself, can eliminate arrogance, can eliminate morbid airs, and can make oneself a promoter, constantly learning from other people's advanced things. Catching up with those who are not as good as others, and demanding to be more advanced than those who are more advanced, is the main purpose of the Beijing Bureau holding this meeting.

Teng Daiyuan pointed out that after the advanced producer movement and the torch of anti-waste are ignited everywhere, a new, overwhelming revolutionary drive will emerge. This drive will break through all the walls of conservatism, constantly destroy the old balance, establish a new and advanced balance, and then destroy and establish again, wave after wave. This is a good thing. This is precisely the law of our cause's progress. This irresistible revolutionary drive will inevitably break through some regulations and systems that are no longer applicable and hinder the further development of productive forces, which is also a good phenomenon. This is a normal phenomenon of revolution. We should encourage breaking unreasonable regulations and systems, protect the enthusiasm of the masses, and further transform our regulations and systems into promoter regulations and systems. Advanced producer representatives should become brave warriors in this regard.

Teng Daiyuan finally emphasized that business must be combined with politics, and technology must be combined with politics. Politics is the commander, the soul. Therefore, we must oppose the tendency of not asking about politics and become both red and expert. Only in this way can we guarantee that the socialist cause will advance by leaps and bounds.

    滕代远谈铁路工作大跃进
    乘风破浪，鼓起革命干劲，开展日产百万吨公里运动
    燃遍反浪费之火，烧掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气
    新华社天津13日电　铁道部部长滕代远在11日闭幕的北京铁路管理局先进生产者及职工代表会议上，号召全国铁路职工乘风破浪，鼓起革命干劲，开展日产百万吨公里运动，为反对浪费、反对保守、贯彻勤俭建国和多快好省的方针而奋斗。
    滕代远首先指出，北京铁路管理局的先进生产者和职工代表会议开得很好。这次会上总结和交流了各项先进经验，代表们的革命干劲很大，情绪很高，管理局的计划、指标、定额经过大家讨论，一再被突破：今年日产吨公里指标比去年提高33.3％；装车数指标比去年计划提高13.7％；节煤指标由五千吨提高到八万吨；今年增产节约八千万元。其他如列车平均总重、机车日车公里、技术速度、旅行速度等各项技术指标都比去年提高，中转时间、停站时间缩短。最近又首先突破了铁道部关于机车大中修、车辆维修、房屋维修等规章制度中的一些不合理的规定。所有这些蓬勃的群众革命情绪，预示着铁路工作上的一个大跃进已经开始，而这个大跃进的浪潮，又首先在北京局开始了。
    滕代远接着说，全国人民在一个胜利接着一个胜利的鼓舞下，生产和建设的热情空前高涨。铁路部门在党中央和毛主席领导下，在第一个五年计划期间，同样获得了光辉的成就。为了适应我国社会主义建设的大跃进，我们将在第二个五年计划期间，修建更多的新铁路，以西南、西北为中心，把铁路伸向我国的广大腹地，使新疆、青海、云南、贵州等边远地区与内地用铁路联系起来，帮助各兄弟民族发展经济和文化。为了改变技术落后的状态，第二个五年计划期间，在建设和运输工作上将尽可能采用新技术。铁路发展的壮阔前景，正鼓舞着全路职工为争取超额完成第二个五年计划而奋斗。
    滕代远指出，现在全路职工已经普遍燃起了反浪费的火把。这把火，不仅将在经济上烧尽一切浪费现象，而且将在政治上思想上彻底烧掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气。这把火，是整风运动的一个重要组成部分，是政治上思想上的社会主义革命。现在在全国铁路展开的反浪费运动是我们当前各项工作的中心一环。全国铁路职工，必须通过反浪费，使我们的工作向前飞跃。
    滕代远着重谈到开展先进生产者运动的问题。他说，我们开展先进生产者运动的目的，是要求落后的向先进的看齐，要求先进的更加先进，用这个办法来不断打破陈旧的定额，不断创造新的定额。这个办法是充分挖掘潜在力量的主要方法。因此，在实质上也是反对浪费、厉行节约的主要方法。就拿北京局来讲，按1957年的统计，在全国铁路管理局中，工作量是第二，次于沈阳局。成本、劳动生产率和上缴利润是第一，这是好的。去年在排送空车方面，充分发挥了社会主义协作的精神，甚至牺牲自己装车，保证了向太原局的排空，这也是好的。这些就是先进的东西，就要努力促使它更先进。但是在有些指标上，北京局的位置就不那么高了，例如机车日产百万吨公里运动中，去年每台机车包括小运转只完成五十八万八千五百吨公里，排为第五位，落在上海、沈阳、锦州、济南的后面。去年机车每万吨公里用煤一二八·一公斤，占全国第五位，还赶不上锦州、上海等局。特别严重的是行车事故，北京局是全国第二个事故最严重的路局。举出这些指标，目的是说明北京局的潜力还是很大的。段与段、站与站、厂与厂，甚至一台机车与一台机车、一个车床与一个车床、个人与个人之间都可以比一比。虽然有些指标，由于条件不一样，因此是不可比的。但比一下也有好处。经常比先进的指标，可以督促自己，可以打掉骄气，可以打倒暮气，可以使自己成为促进派，经常学习人家先进的东西。比人家不如的赶上去，比人家先进的要求更先进，这是北京局召开这次会议的主要目的。
    滕代远指出，在先进生产者运动和反浪费的火把到处燃烧起来以后，会出现一股新的压倒一切的革命干劲。这股干劲会冲破一切保守主义的围墙，不断地破坏旧的平衡，建立新的、先进的平衡，然后又破坏，又建立，一浪赶一浪。这是好事。这正是我们事业前进的规律。这股势不可挡的革命干劲，必然会冲破一些已经不适用、已经妨碍生产力进一步发展的规章制度，这也是好现象。这是革命的正常现象。我们应该鼓励打破不合理的规章制度，保护群众的积极性，来进一步使我们的规章制度变为促进派的规章制度。先进生产者代表在这方面应当成为冲锋陷阵的勇士。
    滕代远最后强调指出，业务必须与政治结合，技术必须与政治结合。政治是统帅，是灵魂。因此必须反对不问政治的倾向，要成为又红又专。只有这样，我们才能保证社会主义事业一日千里的向前猛进。
