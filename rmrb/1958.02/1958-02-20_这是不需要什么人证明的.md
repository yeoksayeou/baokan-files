    This Doesn't Need Anyone to Prove It
    Deng Chumin

    Does it need anyone to prove that the spring scenery has changed the face of the entire world?

    Does it need anyone to prove that the victory of the proletarian democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, as well as the achievements of socialist construction, have rapidly changed the face of old China?

    Does it need anyone to prove that the dictatorship of the proletariat, the establishment of the working class's regime and the leadership of the Communist Party; the formation of an alliance between the working class and the basic peasant masses and all other working people; the elimination of national oppression and adherence to the principle of proletarian internationalism; the elimination of exploitation and classes, and the establishment of socialist ownership of the means of production; strengthening the socialist superstructure—the dominant position of the socialist state, the Party, and the socialist ideological system; strengthening the unity of the working people of our country and the working classes of other countries; and the realization of cultural revolution and the comprehensive development of all working people are the general laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction?

    Does it need anyone to prove that socialism will inevitably rise to replace capitalism; that capitalism will inevitably die?

    Does it need anyone to prove that the strength of the socialist camp has definitely overwhelmed the strength of the imperialist camp, and that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind?

    Does it need anyone to prove that the socialist system has unparalleled superiority over capitalism?

    Does it need anyone to prove that accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and taking the socialist road are the most crucial issues?

    Does it need anyone to prove that the most important transformation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals is the fundamental transformation of their political stance and ideology?

    Does it need anyone to prove that dialectics is revolutionary in its essence? The revolutionary essence of dialectics lies in the fact that it examines everything in its movement and development; and sees the new and progressive things as invincible in the process of social development?

    None of the above needs anyone to prove it. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, we have already had unprecedented great transformations and great leaps forward on all fronts—economic, political, and ideological. Breaking with conventions, innovating in everything, only allowing progress, not allowing backwardness; only allowing promotion, not allowing regression, should be the noble qualities that every worker must possess.

    Our era is a great era, an era of new socialist economy, new production, new forms of labor, new attitudes towards life, new socialist culture, art, morality, a new socialist ideological system, and a new social system—an era of socialist innovators and creators. Only by having a keen sense of fresh things, being good at discovering new things, and supporting new things to overcome old things, can we correctly carry out work and leadership.

    The Party and Chairman Mao are constantly giving us new inspirations, new impetus, and new programs of action under new historical conditions.

    Only new and progressive things have the right to exist, and all reactionary and outdated things should be thrown into the garbage heap of history!

    Five years look at three years, three years look at the first year, and the plan for the year lies in the spring. This year's spring is another extraordinary spring.

    Before the Spring Festival, the capital, due to the people's representatives coming from all over the country, has turned the Huai Ren Hall into a garden of hundreds of flowers for more than ten days, with the sounds of birds and flowers and the thunderous singing. They have now returned to the masses full of determination and confidence, and with revolutionary drive.

    But spring will always belong to us, forever, forever belonging to the working people living under the socialist system.

    这是不需要什么人证明的
    邓初民
    是不是需要什么人来证明：春天的风光改变了整个世界的面貌？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：经过无产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，以及社会主义建设的成就，迅速地改变了旧中国的面貌？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：无产阶级专政、建立工人阶级的政权和共产党的领导；结成工人阶级同基本农民群众和其他一切劳动人民的联盟；消灭民族压迫，坚持无产阶级国际主义原则；消灭剥削和阶级，建立社会主义生产资料所有制；加强社会主义上层建筑——社会主义国家、党和社会主义思想体系的统治地位；加强本国劳动人民和其他国家工人阶级的团结；实现文化革命和一切劳动人民的全面发展是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一般规律性？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：社会主义必然要起来代替资本主义；资本主义必然要死亡？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：社会主义阵营的力量已经肯定地压倒了帝国主义阵营的力量，东风已经压倒了西风？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：社会主义制度对于资本主义来说，具有着无比的优越性？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：接受共产党的领导和走社会主义道路，是最带有关键性的问题？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的改造，最首要的是政治立场和思想意识的根本改造？
    是不是需要什么人来证明：辩证法按其实质来说是革命的。辩证法的革命实质，就在于它把一切东西都在其运动和发展中加以考察；并在社会发展过程中看出新的、进步的东西是不可战胜的？
    以上这些都不需要什么人来证明。我们在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在全民整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，已经在各个战线——经济、政治、思想战线方面，有了史无前例的大转变和大跃进。打破常规，一切革新，只许向前，不许落后；只许促进，不许促退，应该是每一个工作人员都必须具备的高贵品质。
    我们的时代是伟大的时代，是新的社会主义经济、新的生产、新的劳动形式、新的生活态度、新的社会主义文化、艺术、道德、新的社会主义思想体系、新的社会制度——社会主义的革新的创造者的时代。只有对新鲜事物有敏锐的感觉，善于发见新东西，并支持新东西战胜旧东西，才能正确地进行工作和领导。
    党和毛主席就正是在新的历史条件下，不断给我们以新的启示、新的动力、新的行动纲领的。
    只有新的和进步的东西，才有权利生存，所有反动的过时的东西都应当抛掷到历史的垃圾堆里去！
    五年看三年，三年看头年，一年之计在于春。今年的春天又是一个不平凡的春天。
    春节前的首都，已经由于从各地来的人民代表，使十来天的怀仁堂，变成春色满园的百花坛，鸟语花香，歌声震天。他们现在已经满载着决心和信心，鼓起革命干劲，回到群众中去了。
    但春天将永远是属于我们的，永远、永远是属于生活在社会主义制度下的劳动人民的。
