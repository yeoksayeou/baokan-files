Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: U.S. State Department spokesman, Mr. White, was questioned again on January 30 about the U.S. attitude towards holding a summit meeting.

Although the U.S. authorities' obstructionist attitude towards holding such a meeting has been made quite clear, the news of a possible summit meeting reported by two British newspapers on the 29th aroused concern and attention. At a press conference, someone asked White about the news from the British newspapers that the U.S. was changing its attitude towards a summit meeting. White replied that he did not know. He said, emphasizing each word, "I am completely unaware of anything that would substantiate these reports."

Prior to this, on January 28th and 26th, White had already expressed the U.S.'s attitude twice in succession.

    美国务院发言人
    第三次反对最高级会议
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特1月30日再一次被询问到美国对举行最高级会议的态度的问题。
    虽然美国当局对举行这种会议的阻挠态度已经表示得十分明显，但是29日两家英国报纸传出的最高级会议有可能举行的消息激起了人们的关心和注意。在记者招待会上，有人就英国报纸传出的美国正在改变它对最高级会议的态度的消息向怀特提出询问，怀特回答说，他不知道，他在会上一字一顿地说：“我完全不知道有什么事情可以证实这些消息”。
    在这之前，在1月28日和26日，怀特已经接连两次表明过美国的这种态度。
