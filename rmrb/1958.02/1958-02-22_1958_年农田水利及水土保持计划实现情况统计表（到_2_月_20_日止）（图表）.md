    Statistical Table of Farmland Irrigation and Water and Soil Conservation Plan Implementation in 1958 (as of February 20)
    [Note] The percentage of achievement in controlling soil erosion area announced in the above table is calculated according to the latest revised figures from various provinces and regions. The total planned area for all provinces and regions is 143,208 square kilometers. If calculated according to the original plan of 88,228 square kilometers set by the Second National Conference on Water and Soil Conservation, 70.7% has been completed.
    The numbers in parentheses in the table indicate that no report was received for this period, and the figures from the first ten days of the month are temporarily filled in.
    In the statistical table published on February 11, "Qinghai" in the seventh line of the note was a mistake and should have been "Sichuan."

    1958年农田水利及水土保持计划实现情况统计表（到2月20日止）
    〔附注〕上表公布的控制水土流失面积的实现百分比，系按各省区最近修订的数字计算的。各省区计划数总共为十四万三千二百零八平方公里。若按第二次全国水土保持会议原订计划八万八千二百二十八平方公里计算，则已经完成70.7％。
    表中有（）号者，系本期缺报，暂按上旬完成数填列。
    2月11日公布的统计表附注第七行“青海”系“四川”之误。
