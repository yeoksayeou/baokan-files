A Precious Gift

The first group of cadres from the direct subordinate organs of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee, approved to go to the countryside, have set off. In the ranks of the cadres being sent down, many comrades are carrying gifts from comrades and friends: shovels, sickles, small hoes, books, etc. One young lad carried a new sickle with a brand-new bamboo basket on his back. On the sickle handle was written, "Steadfastness makes one progress, ease makes one regress." On the basket handle was engraved, "Cao Yongqiang, labor is the most glorious, gift from mother." He was an archivist in the Commissioner's Office, had been a shop assistant, and this time the leadership approved his going to the countryside for training. Everyone was curious to know the origin of these two gifts. He smiled and replied, "I went home the day before yesterday, wanting to have a good discussion with my mother. I said: 'Mother, I've been approved to go to the countryside...' My mother, without waiting for me to finish, said: 'I know, you're here to mobilize me!' I said: 'No, this time going to the countryside is different from before; this time it's long-term training in the countryside, and I won't be able to come back often to take care of you, old lady.' My mother said: 'You can go with peace of mind! I will arrange the family's life from now on.' My mother also encouraged me to do a good job. Before leaving, my mother bought me a bamboo basket, my father carved the words for my mother, and my brother also gave me a sickle..."

    珍贵的礼物
    许昌地委直属机关首批被批准的下乡干部启程了。在下放干部的行列中，许多同志都带着同志们和朋友们赠送的礼品：铲子、镰刀、小锄、书籍等。其中一个年青的小伙子用一把新镰背着一个崭新的荆篮，镰把上写着“坚强使人进步，安逸使人落后”；荆篮把上刻着“曹永强，劳动最光荣，母赠”。他是专署办公室的档案员，当过店员，这次领导上批准了他下乡去锻炼。大家都好奇的想知道这两件礼物的来历。他笑着作了答复：“我前天回家一趟，想和娘好好的商量商量。我说：‘娘，批准我下乡了……’娘没等说完就说：‘我知道，你还来动员我！’我说：‘不是，这次
  下乡和往回不一样，这回是长期到农村去锻炼，往后不能经常回来照顾你老人家了’。娘说：‘你放心去吧！往后家里的生活我会作安排’。娘还鼓励我要好好的干。临走时娘给我买一个荆篮，父亲替母亲刻上了字，我哥也赠送给我一把镰……”
