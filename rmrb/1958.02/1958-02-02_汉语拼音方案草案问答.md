    9. What are initials and finals?
    Each Chinese character, when read, has only one sound, which is equivalent to one syllable. “中国” (Zhōngguó - China) has two syllables, “共产党” (Gòngchǎndǎng - Communist Party) has three syllables, and “社会主义” (Shèhuìzhǔyì - Socialism) has four syllables.
    By analyzing a syllable, we can see that a Chinese syllable is composed of an initial and a final. The initial is the starting sound of a syllable, and the final is the ending sound of a syllable: the initial comes before the final. For example, the syllable “沽” (gū) is composed of the initial g (割 - gē, meaning "cut") and the final u (乌 - wū, meaning "crow"). In other words, the initial g (割 - gē) and the final u (乌 - wū) are combined, and "割乌" (gē wū) is pronounced as the syllable "沽" (gū). This is what we call "pinyin" (拼音 - spelling).
    Similarly, the syllable “瓜” (guā) is composed of two parts: g (割 - gē) and ua (蛙 - wā, meaning "frog"). g is the initial, and ua is the final. g and ua are combined, and "割蛙" (gē wā) is pronounced as "瓜" (guā). The syllable “乖” (guāi) is composed of two parts: g (割 - gē) and uai (歪 - wāi, meaning "crooked"). g is the initial, and uai is the final. g and uai are combined, and "割歪" (gē wāi) is pronounced as "乖" (guāi). The syllable “宽” (kuān) is composed of two parts: k (磕 - kē, meaning "knock") and uan (弯 - wān, meaning "bend"). k is the initial, and uan is the final. k and uan are combined, and "磕弯" (kē wān) is pronounced as "宽" (kuān). The syllable “筐” (kuāng) is composed of two parts: k (磕 - kē) and uang (汪 - wāng, sound of a dog barking). k is the initial, and uang is the final. k and uang are combined, and "磕汪" (kē wāng) is pronounced as "筐" (kuāng). From this, we can derive a formula: Syllable = Initial + Final.
    However, some syllables do not have an initial and are formed independently by the final, such as “阿” (ā), “安” (ān), “厄” (è), “恩” (ēn), “喔” (ō), “欧” (ōu). Here, we can derive another formula: Syllable = Final.
    But an initial cannot form a syllable on its own. From the above examples, it can be seen that the initial is composed of consonants, such as g, k. The final has three possibilities: it may be composed of a single vowel, such as u, a, o, e; it may also be composed of two or three vowels, such as ua, ou, uai; it may also be composed of a combination of vowels and consonants, that is, one or two vowels followed by one or two consonants, such as an, en, uan, uang (vowels are the backbone and main body of these finals).
    10. How were the Initial Table and Final Table created?
    Although the "Kangxi Dictionary" has more than 40,000 characters, if you ask a Beijing person to pronounce them, disregarding the four tones (as long as the initial and final are the same, the pronunciation is considered the same), they can only pronounce more than 400 different sounds (that is, syllables). In other words, although there are many words in Beijing dialect, there are only about four hundred syllables. By analyzing these four hundred syllables one by one into initials and finals, and then categorizing the same initials and the same finals separately, we can statistically determine the initials and finals in Beijing dialect. By arranging the statistically determined initials and finals in a specific order, we can create the Initial Table and the Final Table.
    The terms "initial" and "final" have long been used in Chinese phonology. Using initials and finals to explain the syllable structure of Chinese has its advantages, so both the Zhuyin symbols and the Hanyu Pinyin scheme use these two terms. The Zhuyin alphabet has twenty-one initials, sixteen finals, and twenty-two combined finals: a total of fifty-nine initials and finals. The Hanyu Pinyin alphabet has twenty-one initials, six simple finals, thirteen compound finals, and sixteen nasal finals: a total of fifty-six initials and finals. Initials and finals are objective existences in Chinese phonetics, so whether it is the Zhuyin alphabet or the Pinyin alphabet, the number of initials and finals is basically the same, and there is no question of which is simpler or more complex.

    9、什么叫做声母和韵母？
    每个汉字读出来都只有一个音，即相当于一个音节。“中国”是两个音节，“共产党”是三个音节，“社会主义”是四个音节。
    把音节进行分析，就可以知道：汉语的音节是由声母和韵母组成的。声母是一个音节的发声，韵母是一个音节的收声：声母在前，韵母在后。如“沽”（gu）这个音节，就是由声母g（割）和韵母u（乌）组成的。换句话说，声母g（割）和韵母u（乌）拼在一起，“割乌”就拼成“沽”这个音节来。这就是我们说的“拼音”。
    同样，“瓜”（gua）这个音节是由g（割）和ua（蛙）两个部分组成。g是声母，ua是韵母。g跟ua拼，“割蛙”就拼成“瓜”。“乖”（guai）这个音节，是由g（割）和uai（歪）两个部分组成。g是声母，uai是韵母。g跟uai拼，“割歪”就拼成“乖”。“宽”（kuan）这个音节是由k（磕）和uan（弯）两个部分组成。k是声母，uan是韵母。k跟uan拼，“磕弯”就拼成“宽”。“筐”这个音节是由k（磕）和uang（汪）两个部分组成。k是声母，uang是韵母。k跟uang拼，“磕汪”就拼成“筐”。从这里可以得出一个公式：音节＝声母十韵母。
    但是有些音节中没有声母，而由韵母独立自成音节，如“阿”a，“安”an，“厄”e，“恩”en，“喔”o，“欧”ou。这里可以得出另外一个公式：音节＝韵母。
    可是声母单独不能组成音节。从以上的例子可以看出：声母是由子音组成，如g，k。韵母则有三种情况：它可能由一个母音组成，如u，a，o，e；也可能由两个或者三个母音组成，如ua，ou，uai；也可能由母音和子音联合组成，即一个或两个母音后面带着一个或两个子音，如an，en，uan，uang（母音是这些韵母中的骨干和主体）。
    10、声母表和韵母表是怎样制订出来的？
    一部“康熙字典”虽然有四万多个字，如果请一位北京人来念，撇开四声不管（只要声母韵母相同就算发音相同），只能念出四百多个不同的音（也就是音节）出来。换句话说，北京话里的词虽然很多，音节却不过四百来个。把这四百来个音节，一个个分析成声母和韵母，然后把相同的声母和相同的韵母分别归类，就能把北京话里的声母和韵母统计出来。把统计出来的声母和韵母分别依照一定的顺序排列起来，就成为声母表和韵母表。
    声母和韵母这两个名词是我国音韵学里早就使用的，用声母、韵母来说明汉语的音节结构有方便的地方，因此注音字母和汉语拼音方案也都使用这两个名词。注音字母有二十一个声母，十六个韵母，二十二个结合韵母：声韵母合计五十九个。汉语拼音字母有二十一个声母，六个单韵母，十三个复韵母，十六个带声韵母：声韵母合计五十六个。声母、韵母是汉语语音中的客观存在，因此无论注音字母或者拼音字母，声母和韵母的数目基本上是一致，并不发生哪个简单、哪个复杂的问题。　（未完）
