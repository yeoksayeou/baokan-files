This Dispatch from Xi'an, February 21st: (Reporter Zhu Bo) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from February 3rd to 16th with the participation of secretaries from various regions and county committees. After repeated discussions, the meeting proposed a battle task to the people of the province: work hard for three years to change the face of the province; strive for six years to reach the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program. The meeting decided that by 1963, total grain output would increase from 9 billion jin last year to 27 billion jin, and total cotton output would increase from 2.21 million dan last year to more than 5 million dan. It is also necessary to develop local industries in every possible way, striving to have the industrial output value catch up with the agricultural and sideline output value within five years.

The meeting believed that it is possible to complete this target, and the key lies in the first three years. The comrades who attended the meeting reviewed the content of the "Eleven Movements" proposed by the people of Yan'an City in August 1944 in accordance with Chairman Mao's call (Editor's note: The "Eleven Movements" were proposed by Yan'an City in accordance with Chairman Mao's call. This movement is a comprehensive and long-term economic and cultural construction movement. This movement has the following eleven specific programs: 1. Every household has more than one year's surplus grain. 2. Every village has a weaving machine. 3. Every district has a blacksmith shop, and every township has a blacksmith furnace. 4. Every township has a civil-run school and night school, a literacy group and reading group, a blackboard newspaper, and a Yangko dance team. 5. Everyone knows one thousand characters. 6. Every district has a health cooperative, every township has a doctor, and every village has a midwife. 7. Every township has a community granary. 8. Every township has a peddler. 9. Every household has one cow and one pig. 10. Every household plants one hundred trees. 11. Every village has a well, and every household has a toilet), and proposed twenty goals for hard work for three years to change the face of the province to the people of the province. The twenty articles are: (1) The province's grain output will double, and the total output will increase from 9 billion jin last year to 18 billion jin. (2) The province's cotton output will double, and the average yield of ginned cotton in Guanzhong will reach 100 jin per mu. (3) Expand the irrigated area by 30 million mu. (4) Control soil erosion area by 60%. (5) Afforestation of 20 million mu. Every household plants 100 live trees. (6) Every household has a water privy, every commune makes fertilizer, and every county runs a fertilizer factory, with an average application of 10,000 jin of crude fertilizer per mu. (7) Every commune has a public boar, every team has a sow, and one household has two pigs. (8) Develop cattle, donkeys, mules and horses, and strive for an average of one head per household. (9) Every commune has eight members (agricultural technicians, water conservancy technicians, forestry and horticulture staff, agricultural machinery staff, midwives, health workers, veterinarians, breeding staff). (10) No idlers in every village, no idle land everywhere. (11) Increase labor attendance rate, with men averaging 300 days per year and women averaging 150 days per year. (12) The whole people runs industry, and the output value increases three times. (13) Every team has surplus grain, and every commune has warehouses. (14) Develop diversified operations, and the income of every commune will double. (15) Every township has a middle school class, every commune has a primary school, and every team has a reading group. (16) No illiterate youth in every commune. (17) Everyone pays attention to hygiene and controls endemic diseases. (18) Eliminate rats, sparrows, mosquitoes and flies, and every county strives to be free of "four pests". (19) Maintain highways and repair rural roads. (20) Every township has telephone access, and large communes install loudspeakers.

The first year is the key to the three years. Whether the face of the province can be changed in three years depends on this year, and whether this year's plan can be completed depends on this spring. Therefore, the meeting emphasized the need to strive to overfulfill this year's grain and cotton production increase plan. Now that "Spring Begins" has passed and the ice has melted, we must seize the time, start early, and get to work quickly. In February, March, and April, we must show greater enthusiasm than last winter and launch a more magnificent spring production movement. We must push forward wave after wave, with one upsurge following another. The task of 10 million mu of water conservancy this year should be basically completed before the end of April. Water and soil conservation work should be completed 70% to 80% of the annual plan before the end of April. Fertilizer accumulation work should be completed half of the annual plan (300 billion jin) before the end of April. The plan to afforest 4.5 million mu this year should be basically completed before the end of April. While carrying out water conservancy, water and soil conservation, fertilizer accumulation, and afforestation in a concentrated manner, we must also effectively do a good job in preparing for farming, field management, seedling cultivation, rice transplanting, and cotton planting.

The meeting believed that although right-leaning conservative thinking has been continuously criticized and some have been overcome, it is still the main obstacle to realizing the leap forward. For example, some people think: "The leap forward can be achieved at certain points, but it is absolutely impossible on a large scale"; "We can only progress gradually, not leap forward"; "The leap forward can be achieved in other places, but it is difficult to achieve in sandy land, plateaus, and high mountains"; as well as only looking backward, not forward, only comparing with the backward, not with the advanced, and being satisfied with the intermediate state of "mediocrity", all these ideas need to be vigorously overcome. The meeting emphasized that we must always firmly remember Chairman Mao's instruction on "constantly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking," and through formulating plans, using the method of stating facts, reasoning, and debate, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains and Jingwei Filling the Sea, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking frequently and constantly in a realistic manner. Anything that can be done through hard work should be actively done, and the so-called right-leaning conservative formula of "cannot be done - not doing it - cannot be done" should be completely shattered.

The meeting focused on discussing the issue of work methods. Everyone believed that the formation and expression of correct ideas, and the quality of work, largely depend on the quality of work methods. The standard for good or bad work methods is whether we can adhere to the mass line and whether we can adhere to the principle of "boldly mobilizing the masses and everything through experimentation." The meeting discussed in detail the methods of planting experimental fields, promoting advanced experiences, and how to be a good county party committee secretary. In the discussion, everyone unanimously believed that planting experimental fields is a leap forward in leadership methods, a key to solving the contradiction of lacking new methods in the face of new tasks, and also a method to completely overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism. In terms of promoting advanced experiences, we must promote the backward to catch up with the advanced and make the advanced even more advanced through methods such as visiting, exhibitions, comparisons, and holding on-site meetings in advanced areas. To achieve this, all localities must start summarizing the advanced experiences of their localities, and identify a batch, announce a batch, implement a batch, and compare a batch, so that advanced experiences can be promoted in a timely manner and can blossom everywhere. Being a good "squad leader" is an important issue for improving leadership methods at all levels and in all departments. Leading cadres at all levels above the county level should go to the countryside for at least four months each year to inspect work and conduct investigations and research, both cursory and in-depth; be good at grasping the center, grasping the key, grasping the timing, making overall arrangements, and giving play to the role of various organizations; grasp ideology, grasp plans, grasp evaluation and inspection, and promptly propose new tasks after a task is completed; communicate more frequently in daily life, communicate ideas, and maintain consistent language; and conscientiously implement the system of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, so as to fully play the role of the Party committee as a fighting commander.

    陕西省委扩大会议向全省人民提出战斗任务
    苦战三年改变面貌粮棉产量加一翻
    放手发动群众一切经过试验是保证胜利的关键
    本报西安21日电　记者朱波报道：中共陕西省委从2月3日至16日召开了有各地、县委书记参加的省委扩大会议。会议经过反复讨论后，向全省人民提出了战斗任务：苦战三年，改变全省面貌；奋斗六年，达到全国农业发展纲要指标。会议决定，到1963年，粮食总产量将由去年的九十亿斤增加到二百七十亿斤，棉花总产量将由去年的二百二十一万担增加到五百万担以上。还要千方百计地发展地方工业，争取五年内工业产值赶上农副业产值。
    会议认为，完成这个指标是有把握的，关键在于前三年。参加会议的同志，重温了1944年8月延安市人民遵照毛主席的号召提出的
  “十一运动”的内容（编者按：“十一运动”是延安市遵照毛主席的号召提出的。这个运动是一个全面的长期的经济文化建设运动。这一运动有如下十一项具体节目：一、每户有一年余粮。二、每村一架织布机。三、每区一个铁匠铺，每乡一个铁匠炉。四、每乡一个民办学校和夜校，一个识字组和读报组，一个黑板报，一个秧歌队。五、每人识一千字。六、每区一个卫生合作社，每乡一个医生，每村一个接生员。七、每乡一个义仓。八、每乡一个货郎担。九、每户一牛一猪。十、每户种活一百棵树。十一、每村一个水井，每户一个厕所），向全省人民提出了苦战三年、改变全省面貌的二十条奋斗目标。二十条的内容是：（一）全省粮食产量加一翻，总产量由去年的九十亿斤增加到一百八十亿斤。（二）全省棉花产量加一翻，关中皮棉平均亩产达到一百斤。（三）扩大灌溉面积三千万亩。（四）控制水土流失面积60％。（五）造林两千万亩。每户植活百棵树。（六）户户有水茅厕，社社制肥、沤肥，县县办肥料厂，每亩平均施粗肥一万斤。（七）社社有公猪，队队有母猪，一户两口猪。（八）发展牛驴骡马，争取平均每户有一头。（九）社社有八员（农业技术员、水利技术员、林艺园艺员、农械员、接生员、保健员、兽医员、配种员）。（十）村村无闲人，处处无闲地。（十一）提高劳动出勤率，男子平均每年三百天，妇女平均每年一百五十天。（十二）全民办工业，产值增三倍。（十三）队队有余粮，社社有仓库。（十四）开展多种经营，社社收入加一翻。
  （十五）乡乡有中学班，社社有小学，队队有读报组。（十六）社社没有青年文盲。（十七）人人讲卫生，控制地方病。（十八）消灭鼠雀蚊蝇，县县争取无“四害”。（十九）养护公路，整修乡村道路。（二十）乡乡通电话，大社安喇叭。
    三年看头年，三年能否改变全省面貌，关键又在于今年，而今年能否完成计划，关键在于今春。因此，会议强调要力争超额完成今年粮、棉增产计划。现在“立春”已过，冰河解冻，必须抢时间，提早动手，赶快动手。在2、3、4月，要拿出比去冬更大的劲头，掀起规模更加壮阔的春季大生产运动。要一浪推一浪，高潮接高潮，今年一千万亩水利的任务，要争取在4月底以前基本完成。水土保持工作，要在4月底以前完成全年计划的70％至80％。积肥工作，要在4月底前完成全年计划（三千亿斤）的一半。今年造林四百五十万亩的计划，要争取在4月底前基本完成。在突击进行水利、水土保持、积肥、造林的同时，还必须切实做好备耕、田间管理、育秧、插秧、种棉等工作。
    会议认为，右倾保守思想虽然受到不断的批判，有些已经克服，但是，它依然是实现跃进的主要障碍。例如有的人认为：“点上能跃进，面上绝不行”；“只能渐进，不能跃进”；“别的地方能跃进，沙地、高原和高山难跃进”；以及只向后看，不向前看，只比落后，不比先进，满足于中间状态的“中庸之道”等思想，都有待于大力克服。会议强调指出，要永远牢牢记住毛主席关于“不断克服右倾保守思想”的指示，通过制定规划，用摆事实讲道理，鸣放争辩的方法，以愚公移山、精卫填海的精神，实事求是地经常不断地克服右倾保守思想。凡是经过努力可以办到的事，都应当积极去办，彻底粉碎那种所谓“办不到——不去办——办不到”的右倾保守公式。
    会议着重讨论了工作方法问题。大家认为，正确思想的形成和表达，工作的好与坏，在很大程度上决定于工作方法的好坏。工作方法好与坏的标准，就是能否坚持走群众路线，能否坚持贯彻“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的方针。会议详细讨论了种试验田，推广先进经验，和如何当好县委书记等工作方法。大家在讨论中，一致认为种试验田是领导方法上的跃进，是解决在新任务面前缺少新方法这个矛盾的钥匙，也是彻底克服官僚主义和主观主义的方法。在推广先进经验方面，要通过参观、展览、评比以及到先进地区召开现场会议等方式，促进落后赶上先进，使先进更加先进。为了作到这一点，各地要都着手总结当地的先进经验，要鉴定一批，公布一批，执行一批，评比一批，使先进经验及时推广，并能普遍开花。当好“班长”是目前各级各部门改进领导方法的一个重要问题。县以上各级领导干部每年至少有四个月下乡检查工作，调查研究，既走马观花，也下马观花；善于抓中心、抓关键、抓时机、统筹安排，发挥各个组织的作用；抓思想、抓计划、抓评比检查，一个任务完成，及时提出新任务；日常要多交谈，沟通思想，语言一致；要切实执行集体领导与分工负责制度等，以充分发挥党委的战斗司令员的作用。
