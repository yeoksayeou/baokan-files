An Unprecedented Spring
Ba Jin

We each remember many stories of spring and have heard many songs of spring.

Since childhood, we have loved spring, because spring brings us gentle breezes, bright sunshine, and a flourishing and beautiful scene. Spring teaches us the meaning of growth and prosperity, and spring infuses us with endless vitality. As soon as we smell the scent of spring, we feel a hundred times lighter and full of energy. We are willing to live more happily and with more vigor.

We have all dreamed of fairy-tale-like springs: with a wave of a fairy's wand or a kiss from a young prince (or some other symbolic action), the whole earth revives, flowers bloom, and songs fill the fields. When the cold wind shakes the paper windows, we often think of the peach blossoms and green willows of spring. Memories of spring increase our courage. "Spring must come, and it will keep coming." "Spring belongs to us." Countless people before us have said such things. But some of our contemporaries have mocked our absurd dreams. They don't believe in the "magic wands" and "princes" of fairy tales, preferring to stay indoors by the fire and never come out.

But spring is knocking on the door. Only the deaf cannot hear the sound of spring. Who would not want to open the door and run out to greet spring, who would not want the spring breeze to cleanse their heart and lungs?

Don't you hear the sound of running? What a magnificent sound it is! Even the words "thousands of troops and horses galloping" are not enough to describe it! It is the sound of the footsteps of 600 million people. Six hundred million Chinese people are running to greet the spring of 1958. Don't you see the light before your eyes? It turns out that 600 million Chinese people are holding torches high to greet the first rays of sunshine of the spring of 1958.

We have just passed through an unusual spring and participated in a thrilling struggle. Everyone has some painful memories or joyful victories. Everyone has been tempered and educated in the struggle of 1957. That unusual spring paved a wider road for China's socialist construction. By presenting the facts and reasoning things out, we clarified the major issues of right and wrong regarding socialism. After the great blooming and contending, of course, the heated great leap forward began. This is not the great effort of a few thousand or tens of thousands of people, but the great march forward of 600 million people. Eighty to ninety million farmers braved the cold wind and snow, using simple tools to dig ditches and build canals to change the face of nature. This is a world-shaking and earth-shattering great scene. Millions of intellectuals went in groups to the countryside to learn productive labor from the farmers, which is another great event that no one had ever dreamed of before. Not to mention the agricultural cooperative members who racked their brains and devised ways, and the workers in large and small factories who made plans and found clever ways to produce more wealth for the country and contribute more strength to the collective... These are countless heroic stories that cannot be fully told.

The whole of China is in motion. The whole country is running forward, and all the people are running forward. From north to south, from east to west, there is no place that is not full of vitality, and no one who does not cherish the ambition of the "Great Leap Forward." The "Great Leap Forward" is a slogan and also an action. This is a loud voice coming from everyone's heart. The atmosphere of spring encourages everyone. In fact, spring has already arrived early in people's hearts. A person who is full of energy cannot walk with a stooped back. A country that is full of strength has to "leap forward." Looking at the bright spring and the blooming flowers ahead, who can help but run lightly towards the future? When this large and orderly procession is marching forward, who is willing to be left behind alone in loneliness? Unless it is that small handful of people who are hostile to the collective. But even they cannot forever close the door to keep out the sunshine of spring. Even if they are deaf, they must be able to hear the cheers of the "Great Leap Forward" in the spring of 1958.

The spring of 1958 is indeed an unprecedented spring. After searching through ancient and modern history, both Chinese and foreign, we cannot find a spring that is so beautiful, so bright, so exciting, and so joyful. Today we have seen the "magic wand" and the "prince" of the new era. In the blink of an eye, the earth has returned to spring, and a chorus of good news has sounded. Many amazing numbers seem to have been transformed from under the "magic wand," and many touching facts seem to have been brought by the mouth of the "prince." But in fact, none of these things are true. They are all transformed from the hands and hearts of ordinary working people. Reality has not only replaced fairy tales but has also surpassed them. The reality we have today is more beautiful and richer than the fairy tales of any era. The Chinese working people are welcoming the spring of 1958 with one piece of good news after another. The wisdom and creativity of the Chinese working people will surely decorate this spring with unparalleled beauty and infinite brightness.

　　空前的春天
　　巴金
    我们每个人都记得不少春天的故事，都听过不少春天的歌。
    我们从小孩时代起就喜欢春天，因为春天给我们带来温和的风，明媚的阳光同一片欣欣向荣的美丽景象，春天教我们懂得生长、繁荣的意义，春天把无穷无尽的生命力灌注在我们的身上。我们一闻到春天的气息，就感觉到百倍的轻快，就觉得身上充满着精力。我们愿意活得更愉快，而且活得更有劲。
    我们都曾经做过童话一样的春天的梦：仙人魔杖一挥或者青年王子一吻（或者用其他象征性的动作），于是整个大地回春，百花齐放，歌声遍野。在寒风摇撼纸窗的时候，我们也常常想起桃红柳绿的春天。春天的回忆增加了我们的勇气。“春天一定要来，而且会不断地来。”“春天是属于我们的”。在我们以前不知道有多少人说过这样的话。但是我们同时代的人中间也有人嘲笑过我们的荒唐的梦。他们不相信童话里的“魔杖”和“王子”，却宁愿关在屋里烤火永远不出来。
    然而春天在敲门了。只有那些聋子才听不见春天的声音。谁不愿意打开门跑出去迎接春天，谁不愿意让春天的风洗一洗自己的心肺？
    难道你就没有听见跑步声？这是多么雄壮的声音！用“千军万马奔腾”的字眼来形容它，还嫌不够！这是六万万人民的脚步声。六万万中国人用跑步迎接1958年的春天。难道你就没有看见眼前的一片光明？原来六万万中国人高举着火炬迎接1958年春天的第一道阳光。
    我们刚刚度过了一个不寻常的春天，参加了一场惊心动魄的斗争。每个人都有一些痛苦的记忆或胜利的喜悦。每个人都在1957年的斗争中得到锻炼，受到教育。那个不寻常的春天给中国社会主义的建设事业铺好一条更宽的大路。摆事实，讲道理，辩明了社会主义的大是大非。在大鸣大放之后，当然就开始了热火朝天的大干。这不是几千几万人的大干，这是六万万人民的大进军。八九千万农民冒着寒风和冰雪，用简单的工具挖沟修渠，改变大自然的面貌，这就是一个惊天动地的伟大场面。几百万知识分子成群结队地下放农村，向农民学习生产劳动，这又是一件前人梦想不到的大事。更不用说农业合作社社员们挖心思、想办法，大小工厂的工人们订计划、找窍门为国家生产更多的财富，为集体贡献更多的力量……这一类说不尽、讲不完的英雄故事了。
    整个中国都在动。整个国家在向前跑，全体人民在向前跑。从北到南，从东到西，没有一处不充满生命力，没有一个人不怀着“大跃进”的雄心。“大跃进”是口号，也是行动。这是从每个人心里发出来的响亮的声音。春天的气息鼓舞了每个人。其实在人们的心里春天已经提前来了。一个人精力饱满，他就没法弯着背踱方步。一个国家充满力量，它就不得不“大跃进”。望着前面春光明媚、花红似锦，谁能不全身轻快地奔赴前程？在这个步伐整齐的大行列向前迈进的时候，谁又甘心一个人寂寞地落在后面？除非是那一小撮仇视集体的人。但是连他们也不能永远关上门烤火挡住春天的阳光。即使他们耳聋，他们也一定听得见1958年春天的“大跃进”的欢呼。
    1958年的春天的确是一个空前的春天。翻遍古今中外的历史，我们也找不出这么美丽、这么光明、而且这么使人兴奋、这么令人快乐的春天来。我们今天看到新时代的“魔杖”和“王子”了。一眨眼的功夫就出现了春回大地的景象，就响起了一片报喜的声音。许多惊人的数字都像是从“魔杖”下面变来的，许多动人的事实都像是由“王子”的嘴上带来的。其实都不是。它们全是从普通劳动人民的手上和心上变出来的。现实不仅代替了童话，而且超过了童话。我们今天的现实已经比任何时代的童话更美丽、更丰富了。中国劳动人民用一个接连一个的喜讯来迎接1958年的春天。中国劳动人民的智慧和创造一定能把这个春天装饰得无比美丽和无限光明。
