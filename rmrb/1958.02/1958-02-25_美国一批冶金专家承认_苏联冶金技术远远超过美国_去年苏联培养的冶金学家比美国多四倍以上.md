Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th Dispatch from TASS: The American "Wall Street Journal" reported that a group of American metallurgical experts who recently visited the Soviet Union admitted that Soviet scientists have surpassed the United States in certain aspects of metallurgy. Dr. Nelson, director of the Metallurgical Teaching and Research Office at New York University, said: "The situation will become clearer in five years. Perhaps we will have to spend several years catching up with the Russians technically."

These American scientists believe that "the Russians have demonstrated amazing talent in rapidly applying theoretical discoveries to practical production." Soviet scholars have gone far in experimenting with boron as a basic component of superalloys. They are moving faster than the Americans in researching metal forming methods that can withstand high temperatures of 2,500 degrees, and they have also made relatively rapid progress in powder metallurgy.

American experts believe: "The Russians are good at using new instruments, for example, using various high-magnification microscopes to conduct metallographic research at extremely high temperatures, extremely low temperatures, and different stresses. Some of these instruments are much more advanced than those currently available in the United States."

The "Wall Street Journal" pointed out: The Soviet Union's emphasis on training metallurgical experts left a deep impression on the American scientists who visited the Soviet Union. Last year, Soviet institutions of higher learning such as the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys and the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute trained 4,500 metallurgical experts. In the United States, only 800 metallurgical experts were trained during the same period by higher education institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Institute of Technology, and New York University.

American experts emphasized that the Soviet Union's plan to further increase steel production is completely realistic.

    美国一批冶金专家承认
    苏联冶金技术远远超过美国
    去年苏联培养的冶金学家比美国多四倍以上
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国“华尔街日报”报道，最近访问苏联归来的一批美国冶金专家承认，苏联科学家在冶金学某些方面的成就超过了美国。纽约大学冶金学教研室主任尼尔逊博士说：“五年后情况将会更明白。也许我们必须把以后好几年的时间用来在技术上赶上俄国人。”
    这些美国科学家认为，“俄国人在迅速地把理论上的发现运用到实际生产中去这方面表现了惊人的才能。”苏联学者在把硼作为超合金的一个基本组成元素来进行试验的方面，已经走得很远了。他们在研究能耐二千五百度高温的金属塑制法方面比美国人走得快，在粉末冶金学方面也获得了比较迅速的进展。
    美国专家们认为：“俄国人善于利用新仪器，例如，用各种倍数很大的显微镜来进行在极高温、极低温和不同应力下的金相学研究。其中有些仪器要比美国现有的仪器完善得多。”
    “华尔街日报”指出：苏联重视培养冶金学家这一点给访苏的美国科学家留下深刻的印象。去年，苏联的莫斯科钢铁学院和列宁格勒工学院等高等学校培养了四千五百名冶金学家。而在美国，像马萨诸塞工学院、卡尼基工学院和纽约大学这样一些高等学校同时间内才培养出八百名冶金学家。
    美国专家们强调指出，苏联的进一步提高钢铁产量的计划是完全现实的。
