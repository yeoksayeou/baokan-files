Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd – The newly built Taiyuan Chemical Zone in China is accelerating its construction to strive for early production and to meet the needs of increased agricultural production.

According to the new plan, this year is the most intense year for the construction of the Taiyuan Chemical Zone. The Taiyuan Chemical Plant will successively put seven major products into production this year, including sulfuric acid, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, liquid chlorine, BHC technical, DDT, and phenol. The Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant and Taiyuan Pharmaceutical Factory, which started construction in April this year, will be basically completed in the third quarter of next year and at the end of this year respectively, shortening the construction time by six months and one year compared to the original plan. After these plants are put into production, the phenol produced annually alone can manufacture 8,000 tons of capron for clothing needs; the ammonium nitrate fertilizer produced annually can increase grain production by 1 billion jin.

According to the new plan, the workers constructing the Taiyuan Chemical Zone are braving the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius to carry out winter construction.

In order to accelerate the construction of the Taiyuan Chemical Zone and adapt to the needs of production management after completion, the Taiyuan Chemical Industry Company was officially established recently. After the establishment of this company, it will uniformly lead all construction and production units in the zone, making the relationship between these units closer, enabling common problems to be solved locally in a timely manner, and enabling the concentration of national manpower, materials, and financial resources to accelerate the construction of the chemical zone.

This year, the construction task of the Taiyuan Chemical Zone has increased by nearly two times compared to last year. In order to make up for the shortage of construction manpower, more than 200 technical backbones who participated in the construction of the three major chemical plants in Jilin have been successively transferred since December last year. The civil construction and equipment installation projects of the Taiyuan Pharmaceutical Factory have been contracted to other construction and installation departments.

　　太原化工区加快建设步伐
    化工厂今年就有七种产品投入生产
    肥料厂制药厂工期缩短半年到一年
    新华社太原3日电　我国新建的太原化工区正在加速建设，争取早日投入生产，以适应农业增产的需要。
    按照新的计划，今年是太原化工区建设最紧张的一年。太原化工厂在今年将有硫酸、烧碱、盐酸、液氯、六六六原粉、DDT和苯酚等七种主要产品陆续投入生产。今年4月动工兴建的太原肥料厂和太原制药厂，将分别提前在明年第三季度和今年年底基本建成，比原订计划缩短了半年和一年的建设时间。这些厂投入生产以后，仅每年生产的苯酚就可以制造穿衣需用的卡普隆八千吨；每年生产的硝酸铵化学肥料，就可以增产粮食十亿斤。
    建设太原化工区的职工根据新的计划，正在冒着摄氏零下二十多度的严寒进行冬季施工。
    为了加速太原化工区的建设和适应竣工后生产管理的需要，太原化学工业公司在最近正式成立。这个公司成立以后，统一领导全区的所有建设单位和生产单位，使这些单位的相互关系更趋密切，共同需要解决的问题能够及时就地得到解决，并且能够集中国家的人力、物力、财力加快化工区的建设。
    今年太原化工区的建设任务比去年增加近两倍。为了弥补施工力量的不足，从去年12月起，已经陆续调来参加吉林三大化工厂建设的技术骨干两百多人。太原制药厂的土木建筑和设备安装工程，已经委托其他建筑安装部门承建。
