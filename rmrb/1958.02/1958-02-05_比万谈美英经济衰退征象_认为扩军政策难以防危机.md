Xinhua News Agency, London, January 30th: According to TASS, British Labour Party left-wing leader Aneurin Bevan published an article in the "Tribune" weekly, pointing out that the idea that the United States' policy of accumulating armaments can prevent the increasingly imminent economic crisis is terrifying.

Bevan, after pointing out the increase in unemployment, the reduction in industrial investment, and other signs of economic recession in the United States, wrote, "Britain has already begun to experience a recession, which is not directly related to events in the United States, but mainly the result of the government's fanatical attempt to prevent inflation by universally restricting credit. Probably by the middle of the year, the results of this British policy and the impact of American trade policies will combine. The overall result is still difficult to predict. However, it is clear that this year will be a year of economic plans going bankrupt and fierce political struggles, followed by an incredible percentage of unemployment."

Bevan expressed concern about some people regarding the United States' plan to increase military spending as "a way to avoid an economic crisis that could become as serious as the crisis of the 1930s."

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 31st: TASS reported that in Britain, more and more merchant ships are being idled, according to the "Financial Times," a British business newspaper.

The newspaper emphasized that the number of idle ships has reached its highest level since 1935-1936. The newspaper wrote: "At the beginning of January, eighty British ships with a total displacement of 375,026 tons were docked for repairs. If the volume of coastal freight and oil transportation continues to decline, more ships will be useless."

　　比万谈美英经济衰退征象  认为扩军政策难以防危机
    新华社讯　据塔斯社伦敦1月30日讯：英国工党左翼领袖安奈林·比万在“论坛”周刊上发表了一篇文章指出，有人认为，美国积累军备的政策可以防止日益迫近的经济危机，这种想法是十分可怕的。
    比万在指出了失业的增长、工业投资额的缩减和美国经济衰退的其他征象以后写道，“英国（经济）已经开始经受衰退，这种衰退同美国的事件并不直接相关，而主要地是政府狂热地企图依靠普遍限制贷款来防止通货膨胀的结果。大概到年中的时候，英国的这种政策的结果和美国贸易政策的影响就会结合起来。总的结果如何，还难以逆料。但是，很显然，这一年将是经济计划破产和发生激烈的政治斗争的一年，随之而来的将是：失业人数的百分比将达到令人难以置信的程度”。
    比万对于有人把美国打算增加军备开支看作是“免除可能成为像三十年代的危机那样严重的经济危机的途径”表示担忧。
    新华社讯　塔斯社伦敦1月31日电：英国商界机关报“金融时报”报道，在英国，停泊不用的商船愈来愈多了。
    报纸着重指出，停泊不用的船只的数字，竟达到1935—1936年以来的最高水平。这家报纸写道：“在1月初，总排水量为三十七万五千零二十六吨的八十艘英国船只，由于需要进行修理而停泊。如果沿海运货和运载石油的数量继续减少的话，将会有更多的船只没有用处。”
