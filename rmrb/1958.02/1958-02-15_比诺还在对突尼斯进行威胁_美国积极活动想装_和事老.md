Xinhua News Agency, February 14th dispatch from Paris: French Foreign Minister Pineau interrupted the National Assembly's discussion on "revising" the constitution on the afternoon of the 13th to deliver a government statement on the situation in Tunisia to the parliamentarians.

In his statement, Pineau described the Tunisian government's series of corresponding measures taken on its own territory after the French bombing atrocities as "violations of international law" and expressed "protest" against these measures.

Pineau stated that the French government was "concerned" about the Tunisian government's series of measures. On the one hand, he expressed the French government's willingness to discuss Tunisia's "emergency situation" with the Tunisian government, but on the other hand, he said that as long as the Tunisian government paralyzes the actions of the French army and continues to exert "intolerable pressure" on France, "such negotiations cannot begin."

Pineau also threatened that France was prepared to supply food and provisions to the French troops in Tunisia regardless of Tunisia's ban, and threatened the Tunisian authorities not to interfere.

Xinhua News Agency, February 14th dispatch from Washington: US Undersecretary of State Herter met with French Ambassador Alphand on the 13th to discuss the possibility of the United States mediating between France and Tunisia.

Sources say that France is currently somewhat hesitant about US intervention. According to the Associated Press, the French government currently prefers to negotiate directly with Tunisia rather than having the United States step in to "mediate."

US State Department spokesman White said on the same day that if France and Tunisia are willing to have the United States mediate, they should indicate this. White admitted that so far, neither France nor Tunisia has formally made such a request.

    比诺还在对突尼斯进行威胁
    美国积极活动想装“和事老”
    据新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺13日下午打断国民议会“修改”宪法问题的讨论，向议员们发表了一项有关突尼斯局势的政府声明。
    比诺在声明中把突尼斯政府在法机轰炸暴行发生后在自己领土上采取的一系列相应措施说成是“违反国际法”，并且对突尼斯的这些措施表示“抗议”。
    比诺表示，法国政府对突尼斯政府的一系列措施感到“担心”。他一方面表示法国政府愿意同突尼斯政府讨论突尼斯的“紧急局势”，但是另一方面他又说，只要突尼斯政府使法国军队的行动陷于瘫痪，继续对法国施加“不能容忍的压力”，“就不能开始举行这种谈判”。
    比诺还要挟说，法国准备不顾突尼斯的禁令而对突境法军供应粮食和补给，并且威胁突尼斯当局不得进行干涉。
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副国务卿赫脱13日会见了法国大使阿尔芳，讨论有关美国在法国和突尼斯之间进行调解的可能性的问题。
    有消息说，法国目前对美国的干预有些犹疑。据美联社报道，法国政府目前宁愿同突尼斯直接谈判而不愿美国来插手进行“调解”。
    美国国务院发言人怀特同一天说，法国和突尼斯两国如果愿意美国斡旋，就应当有所表示。怀特承认，到目前为止，法国和突尼斯都还没有正式提出这种请求。
