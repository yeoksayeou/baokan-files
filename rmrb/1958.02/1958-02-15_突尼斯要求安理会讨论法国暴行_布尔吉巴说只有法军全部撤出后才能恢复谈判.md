Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Tunisian government formally requested the United Nations Security Council on the evening of February 13 to convene a meeting to discuss Tunisia's accusation against the French Air Force for bombing Tunisian villages.

The request was made in a letter from Tunisia's representative to the United Nations, Slim, to the President of the Security Council, Soviet representative Sobolev. The title of the item that Tunisia requested to be included in the Security Council's agenda is: "French Acts of Aggression Against Tunisia."

Sobolev has begun meeting with representatives of member states of the Security Council to discuss the date of the council meeting. According to UN sources, the meeting will be held next Monday or Tuesday.

The Tunisian government has sent a three-member delegation to the United Nations with documentary evidence of the French aircraft bombing of Sakiet to support Tunisia's accusation.

On the 13th, Slim also handed another letter from the Tunisian government to the President of the Security Council, Soviet representative Sobolev, requesting the Security Council to pay attention to the fact that if French troops stationed in Tunisia violate the measures taken against them by the Tunisian government, Tunisia is fully entitled to "legitimate self-defense."

The letter stated that after the Tunisian village of Sakiet was subjected to French aggression, Tunisia took the following restrictive measures against the French army: French troops must not make any movements from their positions in violation of the wishes of the Tunisian government; French naval vessels must not approach Tunisian ports; French military aircraft must not transport reinforcements to land or parachute reinforcements, nor must they conduct any reconnaissance of Tunisian territory.

The letter stated that if the French occupying forces attempt to violate this arrangement, the Tunisian government considers itself entitled to legitimate self-defense. It bears no responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom. The letter also demanded the complete withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia.

On the same day, Tunisian President Bourguiba delivered his weekly radio address. He pointed out that Tunisia is only prepared to resume negotiations with France after all French troops have withdrawn from Tunisian territory. He warned France that if Tunisian forces are attacked, they will retaliate with force.

Bourguiba said that after repeated clashes with French troops, the Tunisian people have "reached the limit of their patience." They are prepared to launch a "struggle for withdrawal" to force the French troops to withdraw. He emphasized that there is no question of allowing the French troops stationed in Tunisia to receive food supplies. If they withdraw from Tunisia, this problem will be solved easily.

At the same time, Bourguiba also expressed in his speech that the Tunisian authorities are willing to discuss the issue of providing the Bizerte naval base to the North Atlantic Group for use. He said that he is willing to hold talks on this issue with any member state of the North Atlantic Group other than France.

On the same day, Bourguiba stated in response to a question from a French reporter that if France is willing to accept American "mediation," Tunisia will withdraw its accusation against the French aircraft bombing of Sakiet from the Security Council.

At the same time, the angry tide of the broad masses of the Tunisian people protesting against the French acts of aggression continues to rise. According to a call issued by the Tunisian Workers' Union on the 13th, all Tunisian workers, shop assistants, and self-employed people are scheduled to hold a five-hour general strike starting at 2:00 p.m. on the 14th as part of the activities commemorating "Sakiet Day." The Tunisian Workers' Union also called on all Tunisian employees working in French military bases to leave their jobs from midnight on the 13th and never return to work until Franco-Tunisian relations return to normal. Roadblocks have been set up on major traffic arteries in Tunisian cities. Many citizens have received weapons and grenades, and they are defending these fortifications together with the Tunisian military police. (Attached photo)

### 突尼斯要求安理会讨论法国暴行  布尔吉巴说只有法军全部撤出后才能恢复谈判

    突尼斯要求安理会讨论法国暴行
    布尔吉巴说只有法军全部撤出后才能恢复谈判
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：突尼斯政府13日晚上正式要求联合国安全理事会召开会议，讨论突尼斯对法国空军轰炸突尼斯村庄一事的控诉。
    这个要求是在突尼斯驻联合国代表斯陵给安全理事会主席、苏联代表索波列夫的一封信中提出的。突尼斯要求列入安全理事会议程的项目的名称是：“法国对突尼斯的侵略行为”。
    索波列夫已经开始同安全理事会的成员国的代表会晤，磋商理事会开会的日期。据联合国人士说，这个会议将在下星期一或星期二召开。
    突尼斯政府已经派了一个三人代表团携带关于法机轰炸萨基埃特事件的证明文件来到联合国，以支持突尼斯的控诉。
    斯陵在13日还把突尼斯政府另一封信件交给安全理事会主席、苏联代表索波列夫，要求安全理事会注意：如果法国驻突尼斯军队违反突尼斯政府对它们采取的措施，突尼斯完全有权进行“合法的自卫”。
    这封信说，在突尼斯村庄萨基埃特遭到法国侵略以后，突尼斯对法国军队采取了如下的限制性措施：法国军队不得违反突尼斯政府的愿望从阵地进行任何调动；法国海军舰只不得接近突尼斯港口；法国军用飞机不得运输援军着陆或用降落伞空降援军，也不得对突尼斯领土进行任何勘察。
  信中说，如果法国占领军企图违反这种安排的话，突尼斯政府就认为它本身可以进行合法的自卫。它对于因此而产生的后果不负任何责任。这封信还要求法国军队全部撤出突尼斯。
    同一天，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴发表每周一次的广播演说。他指出：只有在法军全部撤出突尼斯领土之后，突尼斯才准备同法国恢复谈判。他警告法国说，如果突尼斯军队遭到攻击，它将用武力来回敬。
    布尔吉巴说，在同法国军队屡次发生冲突事件之后，突尼斯人民已经“忍耐到了最大限度”。他们准备发动一次“要求撤退的斗争”来迫使法军撤走。他强调说，谈不到允许驻突尼斯法军获得食物供应的问题。如果他们撤出突尼斯，这个问题就迎刃而解了。
    同时，布尔吉巴在他的演说中还表示了突尼斯当局愿意讨论把比塞大海军基地提供给北大西洋集团使用的问题，他说，他愿意就这个问题同北大西洋集团中除法国以外的任何成员国举行会谈。
    同一天，布尔吉巴在回答一个法国记者所提的问题时表示，如果法国愿意接受美国的“调停”，突尼斯将从安全理事会撤回它对法机轰炸萨基埃特事件的控诉。
    在这同时，突尼斯广大人民抗议法国侵略暴行的怒潮正在继续高涨。根据突尼斯工人联合会13日发出的号召，突尼斯全国职工、店员和自由职业者预定从14日下午两点钟开始举行五小时总罢工，作为纪念“萨基埃特日”活动内容之一。突尼斯工人联合会还号召在法军基地中担任工作的全体突尼斯雇员从13日午夜起离开自己的工作岗位，并且在突法关系趋于正常化之前决不复工。突尼斯市内交通要道已设置路障。不少市民领到武器和手榴弹，他们正同突尼斯军警一起防守这些工事。（附图片）
