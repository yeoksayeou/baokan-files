Enthusiasm is Boiling
    ——A Quick Sketch of the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

    Just past Changping Town, I saw groups of people carrying bedding heading towards the Ming Tombs. It was clear they were going to the reservoir construction site.

    There have been so many news reports about reservoirs these past few days, and even cadres from government offices are clamoring to go build them. I heard that this reservoir is three times the size of Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace, and holds twenty times more water. The dam of the reservoir is more than half a kilometer long and eight or nine stories high. It will take more earth than the Guanting Reservoir. I remember the Guanting Reservoir took three years to build, but this reservoir is supposed to be completed in three or four months. This is truly astonishing!

    Arriving at the construction site, my first impression was its grand scale. On a site four or five kilometers long and more than half a kilometer wide, over 20,000 people were working. The mountains and plains were a dense, dark mass. Several bulldozers were moving on the two large mountains. They weren't moving horizontally, but diagonally, looking like they were hanging on the mountainside from a distance. On the flat ground, there were more than a dozen bulldozers and tractors compacting the dam foundation. The small railway tracks on the construction site were like a spider web, everywhere. Countless people were pushing carts carrying earth. They seemed to be running, yet also flying, as if treading on clouds. I thought the carts weren't carrying much earth, but when I asked, I was told each cart held a ton, which shocked me.

    I went to the design office. I had barely sat down when I saw two people rushing in, demanding blueprints. Yang Xinmin, a staff member, said with emotion that now nothing can keep up with the enthusiasm of the masses. Usually, reservoir construction involves surveying first, then designing, and then construction. But now, things are happening simultaneously, sometimes even in reverse order. The masses are asking the construction office for work to do. The construction office doesn't have blueprints, so they're pressuring the design office for blueprints. But what can the design office do? Much of the preliminary data that should have been collected before the design phase hasn't been obtained yet.

    I thought I'd inquire about the supply of materials at the supply office. I figured that such a large construction site must have at least a few hundred people working in supply. But when I arrived, the courtyard was very small, and there were only a few people inside. A cadre was on the phone. After finishing the call, he said to me: "Dealing with things has never been so easy. As long as you say 'Ming Tombs Reservoir,' it's more effective than anything. No matter how difficult the matter, it's resolved in minutes."

    I said I wanted to talk to a purchasing agent. The people in the room replied, "We don't have a purchasing agent here." How could there be no purchasing agent? I was puzzled. They laughed and said, "In another sense, our purchasing agents could be said to be many, many." What did this mean? I didn't understand. A staff member named Gao Shen explained to me: "Almost everything here is delivered, borrowed, or rented; we don't buy much. As soon as we ask to borrow something, people deliver it. When the Qinghe Brick Factory heard that the Ming Tombs Reservoir needed small railway tracks, they immediately dismantled them and sent them over. And when we buy something, all it takes is a phone call, and the goods are delivered to our door."

    As we were talking, a comrade interjected, "Now all of Beijing is our supply office, all our purchasing agents." He said that a few days ago, he went to the Beijing warehouse to pick up goods, and three loaders insisted on loading the truck themselves when they heard the goods were for the reservoir. After loading one area, they weren't satisfied and followed the truck to several other locations. They refused to go back no matter how much they were asked. In the end, they didn't want any money. It turned out these three loaders had signed up to build the Ming Tombs Reservoir but hadn't been approved. Today, they had finally caught an opportunity.

    I walked onto the construction site and saw a large group of People's Liberation Army soldiers carrying earth from the mountains. It was so cold, but some people were sweating even in just their shirts.

    A soldier told me: "It's more than three and a half kilometers round trip to transport this earth (for the dam body) to the center of the construction site. When we first arrived, we could only make six trips a day, then we increased it to seven trips, and now we can make eight trips per shift." Eight trips, meaning that five people push a cart weighing a ton a distance of thirty kilometers a day.

    As he was speaking, he suddenly pointed to someone and said, "Look, that's our Political Commissar Bian, he's pushing earth all day long just like everyone else." Then he pointed to another person and said, "That's our medic, he's also pushing earth, and he hasn't neglected his duties even when people are sick. He's a really good person."

    Soldier Zhang Jin Xuan was working with great enthusiasm, saying, "We must not only defend the capital, but we must also build it well."

    Walking northwest, I saw a female comrade in a group of people, with a woolen headscarf. I was about to say something to her, but she had already picked up her load of earth and left. An old man pointed at her and said, "That's Zhou Manxia, a cadre from the Petroleum Institute who has been sent to our commune for two months. She's doing a great job. Look, she's carrying two baskets of sand that weigh nearly fifty kilograms, but she carries them as if they were light as a feather."

    I heard people shouting "Add oil! Add oil!" from the top of West Mountain, so I went over. It turned out to be the young men from the Fifth Brigade, who often shout like this to compete with the People's Liberation Army soldiers on the mountainside. After working for a while, they sat together and sang: "…Our steps are neat, our confidence is strong, we throw ourselves into a fierce battle in the mountains… The Ming Tombs Reservoir will be completed soon, securing a happy life… We are the masters of the country, we are the heroes who open the mountains, today's work is for tomorrow's happy life, we will use our wisdom and hands to build a great motherland…" Who wrote this song? After inquiring, I learned that it was written by a young farmer in the brigade named Li Zhengtai, who also composed the music. He said he was very moved after arriving at the construction site, so he wrote this song.

    Instructor Yu Derun said that there is a reason why everyone is working so hard. In the past, the people here often suffered from floods. With the reservoir, we will no longer suffer from water damage. We can use the reservoir to irrigate 20,000 hectares of land, and also raise fish and ducks. We can also have electric lights. A beautiful picture seemed to be in front of his eyes, and he became increasingly happy as he spoke.

    Darkness fell. The construction site suddenly became brighter. More than one hundred spotlights illuminated the construction site as if it were daytime. How familiar these lights are! Every year on "May Day" and "National Day," we see them in front of Tiananmen Square. They have illuminated Chairman Mao's kind face, and they have also illuminated the joyous crowds. Now they have come to the construction site. Listening to the music from the loudspeaker, I was in a trance and returned to Tiananmen Square, watching the joyous people dancing! Yes, the people here are also dancing, but they are dancing the steps of construction, the steps of socialist labor!

    It was already nine or ten o'clock at night, but the editors of the "Ming Tombs Reservoir News" were still reading manuscripts. The manuscripts on the table were piled up like a small mountain. They said that there are too many model deeds on the construction site, and the small newspaper can't publish them all in two issues a week, so they plan to change it to one issue a day soon. They also said that although the editors can only sleep a few hours a day, and their eyes are bloodshot, they don't feel tired after reading those inspiring manuscripts.

    I went to the general construction headquarters and saw that the lights in all the rooms were on. I wanted to talk to someone in the office, but I was afraid they had left work. Just as I was hesitating, a comrade there said, "Go ahead, we have 'four no's' here: no winter, no night, no holidays, no working hours; all we have is enthusiasm. You can find someone at three o'clock in the morning."

    At night, I found lodging at the medical station and didn't sleep a wink all night. The people and events I saw during the day were spinning in my mind, and I couldn't calm down. The sound of tractors and songs from the broadcaster never stopped all night.

    Thinking about these moving scenes, I wanted to find appropriate words to describe them, but I couldn't find them. The enthusiasm of the people is like the spirit of fighting the Japanese devils during the Anti-Japanese War, and like the spirit of fighting the American devils during the Korean War. This kind of socialist enthusiasm, this kind of communist enthusiasm, I don't think there are appropriate words to describe it. Our country, our people, are not walking step by step, nor are they running step by step, but as the soldiers say: "Flying forward like a jet plane."

    Leaving the construction site, I saw groups of people carrying bedding walking towards the construction site. People want to spend the Spring Festival in labor. (Attached picture)

    干劲在沸腾
    ——十三陵水库工地速写
    本报记者　傅冬
    一过昌平镇，就看见一队队一群群的人背着铺盖朝明十三陵走。看得出来，他们是去水库工地的。
    这几天报上登的水库的消息真多，机关的干部也闹着去修水库。听说这个水库的面积比颐和园的昆明湖大三倍，装的水多二十倍。水库的坝有一里多长，八、九层楼高。运的土比官厅水库多一半还多。我记得官厅水库修了三年，可这个水库要在三、四个月里修好，这真叫人吃惊！
    到工地，头一个感觉是气魄真大。在长四、五里，宽一里多的工地上，有二万多人在劳动。山上山下黑压压的一片。好几个推土机在两个大山上走。它们不是平着走，是斜着走，远远看去，像挂在半山腰里。平地上有十几辆推土机、拖拉机在碾坝基。工地上的小铁道像蜘蛛网似的，到处都是。数不清的人推着车送土。他们像在跑，又像是在飞，脚底下像腾云驾雾似的。我以为车里的土不多，问了一下，回答说一车一吨，把我给吓了一跳。
    我到设计处去，刚坐下不一会，见两个人急冲冲地进来要设计图。工作人员杨新民感慨地说，现在什么也跟不上群众的干劲。往常修水库，是先勘测，再设计，再施工。可现在平着来，有时还倒着来。群众向施工处要活干。施工处没图，就逼着设计处要设计图。可设计处又有什么法子呢！好些设计前应有的资料，到现在还没拿到手。
    我想到供应处打听一下物资供应的情况。我心里想，这么大的工地，起码也得有几百个人干供应工作。可是去了一看，院子很小，屋里只几个人。一个干部在打电话。他打完电话对我说：“从来办事没这么痛快过。你只要说十三陵水库几个字，比什么都灵，天大的难事，几分钟就解决了。”
    我说我要找采购员谈一谈。屋里的人回答说：“我们这里没采购员”。怎么没采购员？我正纳闷。他们笑着说：“从另一方面说，我们的采购员，也可以说很多很多。”这是什么意思？我听不明白。一位名叫高慎的工作人员向我解释：“我们这里的东西差不多都是送来、借来或租来的，买的不多。借东西只要说出口，人家就给送来。清河制砖厂听说十三陵水库要小铁轨，马上就拆下来。买东西也只要一个电话打过去，货就送上了门。”
    我们正谈着，一位同志插进来说：“现在全北京都是我们的供应处，都是我们的采购员。”他说，前几天他去北京市的仓库去提货，有三个装卸工听说是水库的东西，一定要给装车。装了一个地方还不行，还跟着车子跑了好几个地方，叫他们回去，他们怎么都不肯。末了，一个钱也不要。原来这三个装卸工报名去修十三陵水库，没被批准。今天可逮着机会了。
    我走到工地上。看见一大群解放军正从山上往山下运土。天那么冷，可是有些人穿着单衬衣还流汗。
    一位战士告诉我：把这些土（打坝身用）运到工地中心，一来回七里多，刚来时，一天只能跑六趟，后来加到七趟，现在一班能跑八趟了。八趟，也就是说，五个人推着二千斤重的斗车一天跑六十里。
    正说着，他忽然指给我看一个人：“你瞧那是我们的边政委，他和大伙一样，一天到晚在推土。”说完，他又指着一个人说：“那是我们的卫生员，他也一样上阵推土，大伙病了，他也没耽误。真是个好样儿的。”
    战士张金选干的真欢，他说：“我们不但要保卫好首都，我们还要把首都建设好。”
    向西北走，在一群人里，我看见一位女同志，头上包着个毛线头巾。正想给她说句话，可是她已挑起土走了。一位老头伸出手指头指着她说：“那是石油学院的下放干部周曼霞，来我们社两个月了，好样儿的，你们瞧，她担的那两筐沙，有百十斤重，可她挑起来轻飘飘的。”
    听见西山头上有人喊加油干呀！加油干呀！就走了过去。原来是五大队的年青小伙子在喊，他们常常这样喊着和半山腰上的解放军比赛。他们干了一阵以后，就坐在一起唱起了歌：“……步伐整齐，信心坚强，投入山间激战一场，……十三陵水库早日修成，幸福的生活有保障，……我们是国家的主人，我们是开山的英雄汉，今天的工作是为了明天的幸福生活，我们要用自己的智慧和双手建设伟大的祖国……”这是谁编的歌？一打听，原来是队里一位叫李正泰的青年农民编的，曲子也是他谱的。他说他到工地以后很感动，就编了这歌子。
    指导员于德润说，大伙这样卖劲，不是没原因的。过去，这地方的人常常受洪水的灾害，有了水库，我们就不再受水害了。我们可以利用水库浇灌三十万亩地，还可养鱼、养鸭子。还可以点上电灯。他的眼前似乎摆着一幅美丽的图景，越说越高兴。
    天黑下来了。工地突然变亮了。一百多盏聚光灯，照得工地像白天一样。这些灯多么熟呀！每年“五一”“十一”我们都在天安门前看见它们。它们照过毛主席慈祥的脸，它们也照过欢乐的人群。它们现在到工地上来了。听着扩音器的音乐，我恍惚间回到了天安门，看欢乐的人们在舞呀！舞呀！是的，这里的人也是在舞，但他们舞的是建设的舞步，是社会主义劳动的舞步！
    已经夜里九、十点钟了，但“十三陵水库报”的编辑还在看稿。桌上的稿子，堆得像小山一样。他们说，工地上的模范事迹太多，小报两天出一期登不下，最近打算改成一天一期。他们还说，编辑部的人虽然一天只能睡几个钟头，把眼熬红了，但看了那些鼓舞人的稿子，累也不觉累了。
    到修建总指挥部，见各屋的灯都亮着，想找办公室的人谈谈，又怕人家下班了，正犹疑，那里的同志说：“你去吧，我们这里是‘四无’，没有冬天，没有黑夜，没有假日，没有上下班；有的就是干劲。夜里三点钟找人都行。”
    夜晚，我在医疗站找到了住宿的地方，一夜没阖眼，白天看到的那些人，那些事在我脑中打滚，我平静不下来。这一夜拖拉机的走动声和播音器的歌声，一直没断。
    我想着这些动人的场面，我想找确当的字眼来形容这些场面，可是我找不到。人们的这种干劲，像抗日战争期间打日本鬼子的劲头，也像抗美援朝时打美国鬼子的劲头。这种社会主义的干劲，这种共产主义的干劲，我看是没有确当的字能形容的。我们的国家，我们的人民，不是一步步在走，也不是一步步在跑，而是像战士们说的：“像喷气式飞机似的一个劲儿的往前飞。”
    离开工地，看见一群群一队队的人背着铺盖向工地走来，人们要在劳动中过春节。（附图片）
    在十三陵水库工地上，劳动的人群在春节期中，继续向沙滩和山坡进行着紧张的搏斗。　本报记者　刘长忠摄
