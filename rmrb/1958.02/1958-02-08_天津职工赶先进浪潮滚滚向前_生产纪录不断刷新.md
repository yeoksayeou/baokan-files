Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch: Riding the wave of the rectification upsurge, a new upsurge in production is vigorously developing among the workers of Tianjin, spreading from point to area with the force of a raging tide and at a tremendous pace.

Comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, with mutual promotion, are new characteristics of this upsurge. Catching up with and surpassing Britain is the goal of all the city's workers. The No. 3 Dyeing Chemical Factory proposed that the quality of five products, including Alpha Naphthylamine Acetic Acid, will catch up with and surpass that of British products this year. The Tianjin Bicycle Factory proposed that the "Flying Pigeon" bicycle will catch up with the British "Raleigh" bicycle within five years. The electroplating team studied the electroplating situation of the "Raleigh" bicycle and found that the electroplating quality of the "Flying Pigeon" was not as good as that of "Raleigh". They decided to catch up with the electroplating quality of the "Raleigh" bicycle within this year. The staff of the technology section of the No. 3 Rubber Factory proposed that the quality of the Victory brand bicycle steel wire tires should catch up with "Dunlop" within two years. Many other factories have proposed that the quality of their products should catch up with Japan, West Germany, and the United States. More factories have proposed to catch up with the advanced level in China. Tianjin No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory and Beida Dyeing Factory will catch up with and surpass the "People's Hero" brand standard of vulcanized blue cloth this year. According to incomplete statistics from Hongqiao District alone, there are 29 kinds of products that will catch up with the advanced level in China and 23 kinds that will catch up with the advanced level in the world.

In order to achieve these goals, socialist competitions have been widely carried out between districts, between industries, between factories, and between workshops, teams, and individuals. The production capacity of the No. 1 Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Rolling Factory is basically the same as that of the No. 2 Workshop of the No. 1 Steel Rolling Factory, but the original shift output of the No. 3 Factory's No. 1 Workshop was more than three tons lower than that of its opponent. After the launch of the friendly competition, the No. 1 Workshop of the No. 3 Factory jumped to exceed the No. 2 Workshop of the No. 1 Factory by more than sixteen tons. After the workers of the No. 1 Factory learned about this, they tried to catch up quickly and exceeded the No. 3 Factory by eight tons on January 14th. The No. 3 Factory continued to catch up, and the next day the No. 3 Factory was ahead of the No. 1 Factory by seven tons. The workers of Group A of the No. 1 Workshop of the No. 1 Steel Rolling Factory failed to complete their plans for four consecutive months at the end of last year. After challenging the No. 1 Workshop of the No. 3 Factory, their output rose to about fifty tons by January 24th. Group C, whose production used to be better than Group A, fell behind, so they immediately caught up, sent people to Group A to learn about increasing production, and then created a record of fifty-three tons. After Group C caught up, Group B became anxious, immediately held a meeting, and also sent people to Group A to learn and catch up. The progress of Groups B and C promoted the production of the workers of Group A, and on January 28th they created an even higher record of fifty-five tons. The workshops of Tianjin Bicycle Factory launched a collaborative competition, interlocking and promoting each other. In the past six days, the production level of each workshop has increased by 10% to 36% respectively.

Because of mutual promotion and mutual catching up, the production records of various factories are constantly being refreshed one after another. The key to increasing production in Tianjin Paper Mill lies in shortening the cooking time of the large pot. Originally, the cooking time for each pot was four hours and thirty to fifty minutes, but in the discussion of the national plan in the second half of January, four new records lower than this time were continuously created. When creating the third new record of three hours and fifty minutes, some people thought that it had reached the bottom, and it could not be shortened further without increasing equipment. On January 21st, foreman and veteran worker Jia Chuanzhao shortened the stifling time according to the changes in the chemical solution and created a new record of three hours and forty-five minutes. This matter gave the workers great encouragement. On February 1st, a new record of two hours and fifty-seven minutes was created. This record is five minutes faster than the highest record of Yingkou Paper Mill, the most advanced in the country, and exceeds the production level target of the factory in 1962. In the upsurge of people catching up with people and groups catching up with groups in the Second Aluminum Products Factory, everyone broke the quota. The original production quota for the melting group was 320 pieces of aluminum sheet. On February 2nd, it reached 503 pieces. Wang Dongquan of the pressing group produced 20 cm pot bottoms with a daily production quota of 2,000 pieces, and on February 1st, 5,376 pieces were completed. The quota for the rushing group to make 20 cm pots was 500, and on the 31st, it reached 9,000. Now many workers are completing a day's task in half a day.

### 天津职工赶先进浪潮滚滚向前  生产纪录不断刷新

　　天津职工赶先进浪潮滚滚向前
　　生产纪录不断刷新
    据新华社天津电　乘整改高潮之风，一个如火如荼的生产新高潮正在天津市职工中以怒涛澎湃、一日千里之势由点到面地滚滚向前发展。
    比先进、学先进、赶先进，相互促进，是这次高潮中新的特点。赶上和超过英国，是全市职工的奋斗目标。染化三厂提出甲荼酸等五种产品今年就赶上和超过英国产品的质量。天津自行车厂提出要使“飞鸽”车在五年内赶上英国的“凤头”车；电镀小组研究了“凤头”车的电镀情况，认为“飞鸽”的电镀质量不如“凤头”，他们决定今年内就赶上“凤头”车的电镀质量。橡胶三厂技术科小组的职工提出要使胜利牌自行车钢丝外胎质量在两年内赶上“邓录普”。还有许多工厂提出要使产品质量赶上日本、西德和美国。有更多的工厂提出赶上国内先进水平。天津第二印染厂和北大染厂要在今年把硫化蓝布赶上和超过上海的“人民英雄”牌标准。仅据红桥区一个区的不完全统计，就有二十九种产品要赶上国内先进水平，二十三种赶上国际先进水平。
    为了实现这些目标，区和区之间、行业和行业之间、厂和厂之间以及车间、小组、个人之间，广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛。跟轧钢一厂二车间生产能力基本相同的轧钢三厂一车间，原来的班产量比对手的班产量低三吨多。在展开友谊竞赛后，三厂一车间一跃而超过一厂二车间十六吨以上。一厂工人知道后，想法急起直追，又在1月14日比三厂超过八吨。三厂接着往前赶，到第二天三厂又比一厂领先七吨。轧钢一厂一车间甲组工人去年年末连续四个月没有完成计划，在向三厂一车间挑战以后，到1月24日他们的产量便上升到五十吨左右。过去生产比甲班好的丙组掉在后面了，他们便立起直追，派人到甲组学习增产办法，接着创造了五十三吨的纪录。丙组赶上以后，乙组便着急了，马上召开会议，也派人去甲组学习赶了上去。乙、丙两组的前进又促进了甲组工人的生产，又在1月28日创造了五十五吨的更高纪录。天津自行车厂各车间展开协作竞赛，一环套一环，互相推动，六天来各车间的生产水平分别提高了10％到36％。
    由于互相促进、互相往前赶，各厂的生产纪录一个接着一个被刷新。天津造纸总厂的增产关键在于缩短大锅的蒸煮时间。原来每锅的蒸煮时间是四小时三十到五十分钟，但是在1月下半月讨论国家计划中，便连续创造了低于这个时间的四次新纪录。在以三小时五十分创造第三次新纪录的时候，有些人认为已经到底了，如不增加设备就不能再缩短。到1月21日，工长、老工人贾传钊根据药液变化的情况缩短了闷气时间，又创造了三小时四十五分的纪录。这件事给了工人莫大的鼓舞，到2月1日，又创造了两小时五十七分的更新纪录。这个纪录比全国最先进的营口造纸的最高纪录还快五分钟，超过了本厂1962年的生产水平指标。第二铝品厂在人赶人、组赶组的热潮下，人人突破定额。熔化组原来生产铝片定额是三百二十块，2月2日已达到五百零三块；压片组王东全生产二十公分的锅底日产定额是二千张，2月1日完成五千三百七十六张；赶活组做二十公分的锅，定额是五百个，到31日竟达到了九千个。现在许多工人都是半天完成一天的任务。
