　　Contrasts Between Past and Present: Thought-Provoking
　　After reading the article and photos "The Same Below Zero" on the fourth page of your newspaper on January 19th, it triggered a series of my associations. In the old society, taking my hometown (Shouxian, Anhui) as an example, the poor people who froze to death outside the "vermilion gates" in winter were countless. But after liberation, the poor turned over, and I never saw that tragic scene again. After looking at the road corpse picture on the right and the false newspaper reports, and then looking back at the photo on the left, in the same severe cold weather, the elderly are leisurely playing chess in the nursing home. I couldn't help but say out loud: The Communist Party and Chairman Mao, you are truly the saviors of the poor!
　　I hope your newspaper regularly publishes articles and pictures of various themes contrasting the past and present. It can educate us, and it can also make those who "forget the pain once the wound heals" think deeply. At the same time, it is a powerful counterattack against the rightists' absurd remarks of "the present is not as good as the past".

　　今昔对比　发人深思
    看了你报1月19日第四版的“同样在零度以下”的文章和照片，引起了我一连串的联想。在旧社会里，就以我的家乡（安徽寿县）来说，冬天冻死在“朱门”外的穷苦人民，真是数不胜数。但是解放后，穷人翻了身，我就再也没有看到那种凄惨景象。我看了右边的那张路尸图和伪报的报道，又回过头来看左边一张照片，在同样的严寒天气里，老年人却在养老院里安闲地下着象棋，我不禁感动地说出声来：共产党和毛主席，你们真是穷苦人民的救命恩人呀！
    我希望你报经常刊登各种题材的今昔对比的文和图。它能教育我们，也能使那些“好了疮疤忘了疼”的人深思，同时，对右派分子的“今不如昔”的荒谬言论也是有力的反击。
