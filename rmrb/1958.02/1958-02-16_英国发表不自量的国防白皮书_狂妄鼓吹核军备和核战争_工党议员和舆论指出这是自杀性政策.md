Xinhua News Agency, London Dispatch: The British government published on February 13th a defense white paper presented by Defense Minister Duncan Sandys.

This white paper reaffirms the nuclear arms race policy pursued by the British government. It even goes further by threatening that, in the event of war between East and West, nuclear weapons would be used by the West even if the Soviet Union used conventional weapons.

Although the United States itself does not yet have intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the British government has already accepted the proposal from the U.S. government to provide such missiles to Britain. The white paper states that an agreement on providing these missiles will soon be finalized. The white paper also states that the United States will help Britain develop intermediate-range ballistic rockets and nuclear submarines, and other weapons that are "more advanced" than the U.S. intermediate-range missiles. It expresses the hope that the United States will provide Britain with nuclear weapons and technical secrets.

The white paper states that the "nuclear deterrent force" mainly relies on "the strength of the U.S. Strategic Air Command and its constant state of alert." It also states: "Cooperation with the U.S. Air Force in operational planning has become necessary."

The white paper admits that the Soviet Union "has made considerable progress in nuclear weapons and rockets." However, it self-deceptively claims that the West still possesses so-called "overall superiority" in military strength. This unfounded fabrication made even the Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" uncomfortable. It said that the claim that the West still possesses "overall superiority" "will certainly meet with very resolute and strong opposition. Because, if these words are believable, then the many strategic and political debates in the months since the (Soviet) artificial satellite was launched are meaningless."

According to a report in the "Worker Daily" on the 15th, Labour MP Konni Zilliacus believes that the white paper is "militarily terrifying, politically suicidal, morally absurd, and intellectually imbecilic."

"Worker Daily" Deputy Editor-in-Chief George Matthews published an article today saying that the white paper, which is intent on frightening the Russians, will instead frighten the British people. Matthews pointed out that there has never been the slightest danger of a so-called Soviet invasion. He said: The danger comes from Dulles, from the American militarists who constantly make bellicose remarks, from the American hydrogen bomb bombers circling overhead. He emphasized that implementing the policies embodied in the white paper would destroy Britain.

Some other newspapers in London are also quite critical of the white paper. Even "The Times" said that this is a white paper that prepares for global war. The newspaper pointed out, however, that last year's defense white paper already admitted that Britain is indefensible under atomic attack.

### 英国发表不自量的国防白皮书  狂妄鼓吹核军备和核战争  工党议员和舆论指出这是自杀性政策

    英国发表不自量的国防白皮书
    狂妄鼓吹核军备和核战争
    工党议员和舆论指出这是自杀性政策
    据新华社伦敦电　英国政府2月13日发表了由国防大臣桑迪斯提出的国防白皮书。
    这份白皮书重新肯定了英国政府所奉行的核军备竞赛政策。它甚至进一步威胁说，在东西方一旦发生战争时，即使苏联使用常规武器，西方也要使用核武器。
    虽然美国自己还没有中程弹道导弹，但是英国政府早已经接受了美国政府所提出的向英国提供这种导弹的建议。白皮书说，关于提供这种导弹的协定很快就要弄好。白皮书还说，美国将帮助英国发展一种比美国的中程导弹“更加先进”的中程弹道火箭和核潜水艇等武器。它表示希望美国能够向英国提供核武器和技术秘密。
    白皮书说，“核威慑力量”主要是依靠“美国战略空军司令部的实力和它的经常处于警戒状态中”。它还说：“同美国空军在行动计划方面进行合作已经成为必要。”
    白皮书承认，苏联“在核武器和火箭方面取得了长足的进步”。但是，它又自欺欺人地说，西方仍然拥有军事力量方面的所谓“全面优势”。这种毫无根据的臆造使得保守党的“每日电讯报”也感到说不过去。它说，所谓西方仍然拥有“全面优势”的说法“一定会碰到十分坚决和厉害的反对。因为，如果这些话是可以相信的，那末，自从（苏联）人造卫星发射以来几个月的关于战略和政治的许多争论就没有意义了。”
    据“工人日报”15日报道，工党议员康尼·齐里亚库斯认为，白皮书“从军事上说是引起恐怖的，从政治上说是自杀性的，从道义上说是荒谬绝伦的，从智力上说是低能的”。
    “工人日报”副总编辑乔治·马修斯今天发表文章说，一心要想吓唬俄国人的白皮书反而会吓倒英国人民。马修斯指出，从来没有所谓苏联侵略的丝毫危险。他说：危险来自杜勒斯，来自经常发表好战言论的美国军国主义者，来自盘旋在头顶上的美国氢弹轰炸机。他强调，执行白皮书所体现的政策将使英国毁灭。
    伦敦其他一些报纸对白皮书也颇为挑剔。甚至“泰晤士报”也说，这是准备全球战争的白皮书。报纸指出，但是去年发表的那份国防白皮书已经承认，英国在原子核进攻下是无法防卫的。
