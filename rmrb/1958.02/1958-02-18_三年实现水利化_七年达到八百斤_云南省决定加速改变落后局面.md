    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Special Dispatch: Yunnan Province will basically realize irrigation in three years and reach 800 jin of grain per mu in seven years. Local industry will catch up with the total output value of agriculture in five years. This is the fighting goal put forward at the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Secretary meeting that ended on the 11th. The meeting suggested that party organizations at all levels in the province earnestly discuss it, make specific plans, and actively lead the people of the province, with the revolutionary spirit of "hard work for three years to change the face of Yunnan," to ensure its realization.
    The meeting believes that Yunnan's agricultural production has historically been backward, and grain could not be self-sufficient before liberation. During the first five-year plan, total grain output increased by 41%, which not only ended the history of relying on other places for grain, but also had a slight surplus. However, the average yield per unit area was only 350 jin last year. Although local industry has also made certain progress, including enterprises transferred from the central government, it still only accounts for 18.1% of the total output value of industry and agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to make several times the effort to change this backward situation. The meeting analyzed that the main reason for the low grain yield per unit area in Yunnan is insufficient irrigation. Among the 41 million mu of cultivated land in the province, there were only 4 million mu of paddy fields in the entire historical period before liberation. In the eight years after liberation, the irrigated area has been expanded by 6 million mu. However, the water conservancy construction movement that began last winter made this year's water conservancy indicators in the province (including increased irrigation, improved irrigation, and irrigated land) reach 10 million mu, which shows that everything depends on human effort. On the basis of completing this year's water conservancy projects, continue to make great leaps forward in the next two years. It is entirely possible to increase irrigation by a total of 25 million mu in three years. In this way, it is estimated that by 1960, the irrigation network combining various water conservancy projects can irrigate more than 77% of the total cultivated land. The basic realization of irrigation in three years can provide an important guarantee for achieving or exceeding 800 jin of grain per mu ahead of schedule.
    The meeting pointed out that another major reason for the low grain output in Yunnan is insufficient fertilization. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to make a revolution in fertilizer accumulation. The prefecture committee secretaries believe that a fertilizer accumulation movement to change customs and habits is currently underway in the inland and most minority areas, and the habits inherited for thousands of years have undergone major changes in a few months. This year's planned fertilizer application has doubled compared to last year. The meeting requested that the animal husbandry industry must be developed in a leap-forward manner, and the masses must be educated to increase the utilization rate of human and animal manure from the current less than 40% to more than 80%. The meeting believes that in addition to the two guarantees of water conservancy and fertilizer, it is also necessary to transform 10 million mu of terraced fields and terraces, plant high-yield sweet potatoes, expand the multiple cropping index, promote and learn advanced experience, promote the use of various new agricultural tools and agricultural machinery, combine production, and green barren mountains and eliminate the four pests in five years. The meeting proposed that this year's total grain output should increase by 15%, and it should be guaranteed to increase at this or a higher rate every year. By 1962, the province's total grain output should be doubled compared with 1957, and the unit output should increase by 65%. By the seventh year (1964), the inland can reach an average yield of 800 jin per mu.
    The meeting believes that along with the great leap forward in agriculture, local industry must also make a great leap forward. The meeting believes that Yunnan has extremely favorable conditions for developing local industry: first, all counties in the province produce coal, and there are also many pyrite resources, abundant hydropower resources, and transportation conditions are improving. Second, the growth of Yunnan's cash crops and animal husbandry can greatly develop the processing industry. Third, Yunnan's various mineral deposits have unique advantages, and non-ferrous metal mineral resources are all over the province. The meeting requested that this year's local industry increase by 50% compared to last year, laying the foundation for quadrupling in five years.

### 三年实现水利化  七年达到八百斤  云南省决定加速改变落后局面

    三年实现水利化  七年达到八百斤
    云南省决定加速改变落后局面
    本报特约新华社昆明讯　云南省将在三年内基本实现水利化，七年内达到亩产粮食八百斤，五年内地方工业赶上农业总产值。这是在11日结束的中共云南省地委书记会议上提出的战斗目标。会议建议全省各级党组织认真加以讨论，作出具体规划积极领导全省人民，以“苦战三年，改变云南面貌”的革命气概，保证实现。
    会议认为：云南的农业生产历史上处于落后状态，解放前粮食不能自给。第一个五年计划期间，粮食总产量增加了41％，不仅结束了粮食仰赖外地的历史，而且已稍有节余。但平均单位面积产量到去年还只有三百五十斤。地方工业虽也获得了一定发展，但连同中央下放企业在内，也还只占工农业总产值18.1％。因此必须加几倍的努力，才能改变这种落后的局面。会议分析：云南粮食单位产量低的主要原因是水利不足，全省四千一百万亩耕地中，解放前的整个历史时期，水田只有四百万亩，解放后八年，已扩大灌溉面积六百万亩，但是，去冬开始的兴修水利运动，使今年全省的水利指标（包括增灌、改善灌溉和水浇地）已达一千万亩，可见事在人为。在完成今年水利工程量的基础上，明后两年继续大跃进。三年总共增加灌溉二千五百万亩是完全可能的，这样，预计到1960年，各种水利相结合的灌溉网，就可以使占全部耕地77％强的土地得到灌溉，三年基本实现水利化，就可为提前达到或超过亩产粮食八百斤提供重要的保证。
    会议指出：云南粮食产量不高的另一重大原因是施肥过少，因此必需大力发动群众，在积肥上来一个革命。地委书记们认为：目前，农村中一个移风易俗的积肥运动也已在内地和大多少数民族地区展开，几千年来因袭的习惯在几个月内发生了大变革。今年的施肥计划量已比去年增加一倍。会议要求：必需跃进式的发展畜牧业，并教育群众，把人畜肥的利用率由现在的不到40％提高到80％以上。会议认为：除了水利、肥料两项保证，还应该改出梯田梯地一千万亩，种植高产薯类，扩大复种指数，推广和学习先进经验，推广使用各种新式农具农业机械，结合生产，五年绿化荒山，消灭四害。会议提出：今年的粮食总产量应增加15％，并保证每年以这样或更高的幅度递增，到1962年，全省粮食总产量应较1957年增加一倍，单位产量增加65％，到第七年（1964年），内地就可以达到平均亩产八百斤。
    会议认为：和农业大跃进的同时，地方工业也必需大跃进。会议认为：云南发展地方工业有着极为优越的条件：首先全省县县产煤，硫铁矿资源也多，水电资源充沛，交通条件正在改善。其次，云南经济作物和畜牧业的增长，可以大量发展加工工业。第三，云南各种矿藏有着得天独厚的优势，有色金属矿的资源遍及全省。会议要求今年的地方工业比去年增长50％，为五年翻四倍打下基础。
