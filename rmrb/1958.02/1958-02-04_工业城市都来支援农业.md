　　Industrial Cities Support Agriculture
　　Commentator of this Newspaper
    A few days ago, this newspaper introduced the experience of Songbu Town, Macheng County, Hubei Province, in supporting the great leap forward in agriculture. This is one type. Today, the news from Zhuzhou City and Changsha City in Hunan Province, published in this newspaper, provides a good example of industrial cities and central cities supporting agriculture, which is another type. There are many things that industrial cities can and should do to directly support agriculture. As long as this work is organized, and the potential of all aspects is tapped, the suburban agricultural production of various large and medium-sized industrial cities will surely have a leap forward development with the direct support of the cities.

    Industrial cities produce a large number of means of production and means of livelihood, and they are originally the main force in supporting agriculture. There is no doubt about this. All industrial cities should focus on doing a good job in industrial production and organizing a great leap forward in industrial production as the main content of supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. There is also no doubt about this. However, should the support of industrial cities for the great leap forward in agriculture be limited to the production of some agricultural tools and cloth? No, industrial cities have more content to support the great leap forward in agriculture, and it is entirely possible and fully should do more for the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    From the experience of Zhuzhou City's comprehensive support for the great leap forward in agriculture and Changsha City's organization of factories to sign contracts with agricultural cooperatives to regularly support agricultural production, we can see how huge the potential of industrial cities to support agriculture is! Which city does not have all kinds of mechanical equipment? Which city does not have hundreds or thousands of engineering and technical personnel? Which city does not have dozens or hundreds of tons of sewage, meat bones, and garbage and other good agricultural fertilizers every day, which are casually disposed of at a very high price! However, for a long time, many cities have not tapped these potentials and used them for agricultural production in nearby rural areas. Cities rely on suburban rural areas to supply grain, meat, and vegetables (of course, not only rely on suburban rural areas), and sometimes even feel that suburban rural areas are backward and cannot serve the cities well, but rarely consider how to use the city's relatively strong technical force, material resources, and "waste materials" to support the rural areas in the suburbs and improve the agricultural production in the suburbs to an advanced level as soon as possible.

    The problem is not only that industrial cities have the infinite potential to support the great leap forward in agriculture in nearby rural areas, but also that this kind of support is urgently needed to establish socialist urban-rural relations. Socialist urban-rural relations are relations of mutual support, and the connection between industrial cities and suburban rural areas is even closer. Every move of the city may have a certain impact on agricultural production and the thinking of farmers. This must be considered when formulating various policies and measures for urban work. It is also required by the central government's policy of "proceeding from the 600 million people, taking overall consideration, and making appropriate arrangements." In the past, some cities were not clear about this policy. When they thought about problems and did work, they only proceeded from the cities and did not consider the suburbs and vast rural areas that were nearby, thus often causing imbalances in urban-rural relations. For example, more farmland was requisitioned during the construction of factories, the original water conservancy and irrigation systems in rural areas were destroyed, the welfare benefits of factory and mine workers were too high, and recruitment personnel went to the countryside to recruit workers without authorization, so that some farmers were uneasy about agricultural production and blindly flowed into the cities, and so on. If these problems are not solved, cities will always have many "troubles." Zhuzhou City's comprehensive support for the great leap forward in agriculture has completely changed this situation. In their area, it is no longer a matter of avoiding imbalances in urban-rural relations, but of further closeing urban-rural relations through comprehensive support for the great leap forward in agriculture. In fact, the great development of agriculture in the suburbs and the more adequate supply of grain and non-staple food in the cities are also a guarantee for the city's industrial construction. This kind of urban-rural mutual support is a new type of socialist urban-rural relationship, which every industrial city should vigorously develop.

    Perhaps some people will say: "It will cost more money to do as Zhuzhou does." Yes, it will cost some money, but not much. Taking the Baishigang Bridge built in Zhuzhou as an example, the original investment was 220,000 yuan. In order to prevent agriculture from being affected by floods and to greatly increase production, an additional sluice gate was built, which only requires an additional investment of about 150,000 yuan. If another sluice gate were to be built, it would definitely not be possible to solve the problem with this amount of money. Although 150,000 yuan is also a considerable amount, it can be exchanged for an increase of 500 kilograms of grain per mu on more than 6,000 mu of farmland, and the entire investment can be recovered within two years. Why not do it? Moreover, many projects can also be invested by agricultural cooperatives themselves, without the need for the state to spend money, and they should be held without hesitation.

    Suburbs are closer to cities than general rural areas. Relying on the help of cities, they have the conditions to leap forward faster than general rural areas. However, the agricultural production in many urban suburbs still seems to be relatively backward. Last year, the grain yield per mu of farmland in the suburbs of Zhuzhou was 570 kilograms, while the yield per mu in Liling County, which is adjacent to Zhuzhou, reached 803 kilograms. It can be seen that the potential of agricultural production in urban suburbs is extremely considerable. Supporting the great leap forward in agriculture in the suburbs, thereby driving more rural areas to leap forward, is a responsibility that every industrial city must shoulder.

　　工业城市都来支援农业
　　本报评论员
    前几天，本报介绍了湖北省麻城县宋埠镇支援农业大跃进的经验。这是一种类型。今天，本报发表的湖南省株洲市和长沙市的消息，提供了工业城市和中心城市支援农业的良好榜样，这又是一种类型。工业城市直接支援农业，应该做和可以做的事情多得很。只要把这项工作组织起来，把各方面的潜力挖掘出来，各个大、中工业城市的郊区农业生产，在城市的直接支援下，必将有飞跃的发展。
    工业城市生产大量的生产资料和生活资料，它本来就是支援农业的主力阵地，这是毫无疑问的。一切工业城市都应该以搞好工业生产，组织工业生产大跃进，作为支援农业生产大跃进的主要内容，这也是毫无疑问的。但是，工业城市对农业大跃进的支援，是不是只能限制于生产一些农具和布匹的范围内呢？不，工业城市对农业大跃进的支援还有更多的内容，完全应该、也完全可能为农业生产的大跃进做更多的事情。
    从株洲市全面支援农业大跃进和长沙市组织工厂同农业社订合同，经常支援农业生产的经验中，我们可以看到工业城市支援农业的潜力是多么巨大！哪一个城市没有各式各样的机械设备？哪一个城市没有成百成千的工程技术人员？哪一个城市哪一天没有几十吨、几百吨污水、肉骨头和垃圾等良好的农业肥料，花很高的价钱随随便便地处理掉！可是，在很长的时间里、许多城市并没有把这些潜力挖掘出来，用到附近农村的农业生产上去。城市依靠着郊区农村供应粮食，肉类和蔬菜（当然也不仅是依靠郊区农村），有时甚至觉得郊区农村落后，不能很好地为城市服务，却很少考虑怎样利用城市比较强大的技术力量、物力和“废料”来支援郊区的农村、把郊区的农业生产、尽快地提高到先进的水平。
    问题还不在于工业城市有支援附近农村农业大跃进的无穷潜力，问题还在于这种支援是建立社会主义的城乡关系所迫切需要的。社会主义的城乡关系是相互支援的关系，工业城市和郊区农村的联系更是密切，城市的一举一动，都可能对农业生产和农民的思想产生一定的影响。这是制订城市工作各种政策措施所必须考虑的。也是中央提出的“一切从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排”的方针所要求的。过去，有些城市对这个方针不明确，他们想问题，做工作，只从城市出发，没有同近在一旁的郊区和广大的农村联系起来考虑，因而常常使得城乡关系失调。例如建设工厂的时候多征了农田、破坏了农村原有水利灌溉系统，厂矿职工的福利待遇过高，招工人员擅自下乡招工，使部分农民不安心农业生产，盲目流入城市等等。这些问题不解决，城市总是会有许多“麻烦”的。株洲市全面支援农业大跃进，完全改变了这种情况。在他们那里已经不是避免城乡关系失调，而是从全面支援农业大跃进中，更加密切了城乡关系。事实上郊区农业大发展了，城市的粮食、副食品得到更充分的供应，也是城市进行工业建设的一个保证。这种城乡相互支援是新型的社会主义的城乡关系，是每一个工业城市都要大力发展的。
    或许有人说：“像株洲那么做，要多花一些钱”。是的，是要花一些钱，但并不很多。以株洲建设的白石港桥来说，原来投资二十二万元，为使农业免受水灾，并可大量增产，加建一座水闸，只需再投资十五万元左右。若是另外再建水闸，决不是这个数目所能解决问题的。十五万元虽然也是一个不小的数目，但能够换来六千多亩农田每亩增产五百斤粮食，两年之内可以收回全部投资，又何乐而不为呢？况且，许多工程还可以由农业合作社自己来投资，国家不需花钱，更应该毫不动摇地举办起来。
    郊区比一般农村更接近城市，依靠城市的帮助，有条件比一般农村跃进得更快。可是，许多城市郊区的农业生产现在看来还是比较落后的。去年，株洲城市郊区农田每亩产粮食五百七十斤，而同株洲毗邻的醴陵县每亩产量达八百零三斤。可见城市郊区农业生产的潜力是极其可观的。支援郊区农业的大跃进，从而带动更多的农村跃进，是各个工业城市必须担负起来的责任。
