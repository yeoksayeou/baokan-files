Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The General Delegation of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea concluded its慰問 activities in Pyongyang on the 25th. In the morning, they left Pyongyang by train for the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

That afternoon, the General Delegation arrived at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. More than 4,000 officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army headquarters and local Korean people lined up for two Chinese miles in the drizzling rain to welcome them. When the General Delegation, headed by Chief Wang Yifu, arrived, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers held up colorful flags with "Welcome the Motherland's Delegation" written on them and shouted slogans such as "Welcome Relatives from the Motherland." The thunderous cheers and the sound of gongs and drums echoed through the valley. Chief Wang Yifu and representatives of the delegation shook hands warmly with the people lining the streets and exchanged greetings.

Before the General Delegation arrived at the headquarters of the Volunteer Army, Major General Ding Laifu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, led many officers to the station near the驻地 to greet them and accompanied the representatives to the 驻地.

During their twelve days in Pyongyang, the General Delegation extended their regards to the Korean people in various forms, including慰問 rallies,慰問 performances,座谈s, visits, and tours. During this period, the delegation also extensively visited the troops of the Korean People's Army stationed in Pyongyang. Chief Wang Yifu, Deputy Chief Rong Yiren, Wu Tao, and representatives of the delegation held座谈s with combat heroes of the Korean People's Army and presented silk banners to the headquarters of the People's Army, as well as the Air Force, Tank Corps, and Public Security Forces.

The General Delegation also visited the Pyongyang Textile Factory, Gangseon Steel Plant, Kim Il-sung University, and agricultural production cooperatives in Pyongyang. The great achievements of the Korean people in post-war reconstruction and their hard work and diligence left a very deep impression on the representatives of the General Delegation.
