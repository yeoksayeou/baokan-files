　　I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the National People's Congress," and Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee Wu Yuzhang's "Report on Current Writing Reform Work and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," and suggest that the Congress adopt them.

　　The water conservancy construction of last winter and this spring greatly promoted agricultural production

　　Last winter and this spring, the water conservancy construction movement in Hubei Province, under the guidance of the policy of "relying on the masses and managing water conservatively," set off an unprecedented mass upsurge. According to incomplete statistics, 363 water conservancy projects with an area of over 10,000 mu have started construction last winter and this spring, an increase of about twelve times compared with the new projects built in the eight years from 1949 to 1957, and 25 projects have been completed by the beginning of January; 356,675 water conservancy projects with an area of less than 10,000 mu have started construction, an increase of about 52 times compared with the new projects built in the past eight years, and more than 216,000 projects have been completed, and it is expected to reach more than 620,000 projects. The total earthwork of all projects is 500 million cubic meters, which is about twice the total amount completed in the eight years from 1949 to 1957.

　　After the completion of all these projects, the irrigation area will be increased by 10 million mu, the irrigation area will be improved by 12 million mu, and the drainage and flood control area will be increased by 5 million mu. By the beginning of January, the completed projects have increased the irrigation area by 3.27 million mu, improved the irrigation area by 2.56 million mu, and increased the drainage and flood control area by 300,000 mu. This will play a decisive role in promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production in Hubei Province.

　　Relying on the masses to manage water conservancy, spending less money, doing more, progressing quickly, and achieving good results

　　Due to the implementation of the water conservancy work policy of "relying on the masses and managing water conservancy conservatively," and the adoption of a large number of methods of mass self-management and partial public assistance for large-scale projects in actual work, the state investment was greatly reduced and the project cost was reduced. For example, the Heiwuwan Reservoir in Sui County and the Meichuan Reservoir in Guangji County both irrigate 130,000 mu. The former was invested 8 million yuan by the state (saving 2 million yuan compared with the original budget), while the latter was only 2 million yuan. The Ma'anshan Reservoir in Sui County irrigates 100,000 mu, and the state only invested 50,000 yuan. The Jiuji Great Canal in Nanzhang is more than 200 li long and irrigates 300,000 mu. After completion, it will pass through 43 mountains, drill through 5 mountain caves, and pass through 32 ravines, but the state only invested 40,000 yuan. According to preliminary estimates, the self-raised funds used by agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province for water conservancy construction and material preparation last winter and this spring are about 15 million yuan. The average cost per mu of reservoir projects above 10,000 mu has been reduced from about 30 yuan in the past to 8 to 10 yuan, and the cost of large-scale comprehensive utilization reservoir projects above 100,000 mu has been reduced from about 80 yuan to about 30 yuan.

　　Facts have proved that carrying out water conservancy according to this policy not only spends very little money and does a lot, but also progresses very quickly and achieves very good results. This is in sharp contrast with the past situation of simply relying on state investment, as the masses said, "the government repairs ponds and the masses help," and "the government pays and the masses repair ponds," which resulted in spending a lot of money, doing very little, and progressing very slowly.

　　Following the mass line, there are many innovations in project planning and tool improvement

　　The water conservancy movement in Hubei Province last winter and this spring, due to fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, and consistently implementing the working method of combining leadership, technology, and the masses from beginning to end, has resulted in many creative innovations in water conservancy project planning and tool improvement. In planning, due to the impetus of Jun County and Guanghua County in Xiangyang Prefecture, agricultural cooperatives in many areas have broken with conventions and fully utilized the irrigation efficiency of various water sources, building dams across rivers and streams that were not well utilized in the past, opening canals along the mountains, building ponds and weirs along the canals, connecting rivers and canals, connecting canals and weirs, and connecting rivers, canals, ponds, and weirs into a large and complete self-flowing irrigation system. Some canals are hundreds of li long and closely connected with ponds and weirs, irrigating vast expanses of fertile fields. Therefore, many people call the canals watermelon vines and the weirs guesthouses. Many such magnificent self-flowing irrigation systems were built by the masses themselves under the slogan of "self-financing, self-repair, self-use, and self-management," which not only does not require large state investment, but also does not require a large amount of industrial equipment, so many projects can be carried out simultaneously in a short period of time. In tool improvement, because the broad masses of people understand that tool improvement is the main factor in saving labor, and at the same time adopted the working method of leaders taking the lead, everyone contributing ideas, and everyone doing it themselves, a mass tool improvement movement is gradually unfolding throughout the province under the impetus of Paoma Township in Dangyang County, Yichang Prefecture. As of mid-January, Dangyang County has used 20,572 various tools in water conservancy, and in 13 days, it has saved more than 572,800 labor force, and it is expected to save another 800,000 labor force upon completion of all projects. Now, 23,700 people have been drawn to participate in field management, sideline occupations, and land reclamation, while the water conservancy plan has increased from the original 2.46 million cubic meters of earthwork to 6.1 million cubic meters of earthwork, and 2.56 million cubic meters of earthwork has been completed by mid-January. There, you can see dozens of improved tools such as antenna transporting firewood, crane transporting soil, trailers, wooden rail dump trucks, crawler transporting soil, and frog-type ramming frames, and these tools are all made from local materials, utilizing waste materials, and costing nothing. After using these tools, the work efficiency is generally increased by three times, and the highest can reach ten times or even twenty times.

　　"Stars all over the sky, ten thousand lights on the ground," rotating day and night, the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction is high

　　The enthusiasm and initiative of the masses in water conservancy construction are also rare in recent years. In the current upsurge of water conservancy construction, the attendance rate of water conservancy construction in most areas of Hubei Province generally accounts for 60% to 70% of the total labor force. When the project enters the tense construction stage, auxiliary labor in many areas also participates in the auxiliary labor of the construction site, so the attendance rate sometimes reaches 100%. In the Ma'anshan Reservoir in Sui County, we once saw a thirteen-year-old girl with a smile on her face carrying soil to build a dam. Farmers are working hard and happily on the construction site, day and night, by the cliffs and water. At night, the construction site is "stars all over the sky, ten thousand lights on the ground." Despite the three shifts rotating day and night, the mood of the masses is still very full, because under the leadership and education of the Party, they deeply understand that water conservancy construction is the key to ensuring a great leap forward in agricultural production, and increased agricultural production is the material basis for improving the lives of farmers; the Party has also adopted a mutually beneficial policy of determining the task of burden according to the benefits in specific leadership, so that they closely combine socialist construction with personal interests, so their mood is high and their determination is firm. The farmers of Ma'anshan Reservoir in Sui County put forward the slogan of "turning Longqingsi into Crystal Palace," and in fact, the masses have used their infinite power to move mountains, cut off many cliffs, and change the course of many rivers. In the face of these great achievements, we have a deeper understanding of the wise and correct leadership of the Party, the infinite wisdom of the masses, and the greatness and glory of labor.

　　Strive to eliminate water and drought disasters in five years and promote a greater leap forward in agricultural production

　　Water conservancy construction is the lifeline of agricultural production. The broad masses of farmers in Hubei Province have achieved great results under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the active support of all parts of the country, and their own selfless labor. The achievement of these results is by no means accidental. It is the crystallization of the wisdom and labor of the masses, and the result of the combination of leadership and the masses. The broad masses of farmers in Hubei Province are not satisfied with these achievements and victories. They are conducting visits and comparisons, exchanging experiences, learning from each other, and promoting each other, and continuing to fight tenaciously with mountains and rivers. They want to transform rivers and valleys with their wisdom and hardworking hands, turn water hazards into water conservancy, and turn wasteland into fertile fields. Under the leadership of the Party, they will further implement the water conservancy work policy of "relying on the masses and managing water conservancy conservatively," strive to eliminate water and drought disasters throughout the province in five years, and strive for greater victories on the basis of victory to promote a greater leap forward in agricultural production throughout the province.

　　Recalling last June and July, we once angrily rebuked the right-wing elements such as Zhang, Luo, Chu, Chen, Huang, Tan, and Long on this platform, and also cited countless facts to refute their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist lies and fallacies. Now, these right-wing elements should be brought to the construction sites of large mountainous water conservancy projects to let them see the correct leadership of our Party and the great initiatives of the people again in the face of the vigorous water conservancy construction movement, and once again recognize their absurdity and ignorance, and honestly transform themselves under the supervision and education of the masses, repent and reform, and start anew.

　　苦战五年消灭水旱灾
    李明灏代表报告湖北省依靠群众勤俭治水的情况
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会的工作报告”和中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，建议大会通过。
    去冬今春的水利建设  大大促进了农业生产
    去冬今春，湖北省的水利建设运动，在“依靠群众，勤俭治水”的方针指导下，掀起了群众性的、空前未有的高潮。据不完全的统计，去冬今春已开工的万亩以上的水利工程三百六十三处，较一九四九年至一九五七年八年中新建工程增加约十二倍，至元月上旬已完工二十五处；万亩以下的水利工程已开工三十五万六千六百七十五处，较过去八年新建工程增加约五十二倍，现已完工二十一万六千多处，预计可达到六十二万多处。全部工程共计土方五亿公方，约相当一九四九年到一九五七年八年来完成总数的两倍。
    这些工程全部完工后，将增加灌溉面积一千万亩，改善灌溉面积一千二百万亩，增加排水防涝面积五百万亩。至元月上旬已完工的工程可增加灌溉面积三百二十七万亩，改善灌溉面积二百五十六万亩，增加排水防涝面积三十万亩。这对促进湖北省的农业生产的大跃进起着决定性的作用。
    依靠群众治水，花钱少，办得多，进度快，效果好
    由于贯彻执行了“依靠群众，勤俭治水”的水利工作方针，实际工作中采取了大量的群众自办和部分大型工程实行民办公助的办法，因而大大减少了国家投资，降低了工程造价。例如随县的黑屋湾水库和广济县的梅川水库，都是灌溉十三万亩。而前者国家投资八百万元
  （较原预算尚节约二百万元），后者仅二百万元。随县马鞍山水库灌溉十万亩，国家仅投资五万元。南漳的九集大渠，全长二百多华里，灌溉三十万亩，建成后要通过四十三座山，钻通五个山洞，穿过三十二条沟，但国家仅投资四万元。据初步估算，湖北省去冬今春农业社兴修水利用于备料的自筹资金在一千五百万元左右。每亩平均造价万亩以上的水库工程由过去的三十元左右减少到八至十元，十万亩以上的大型综合利用水库工程由八十元左右减少到三十元左右。
    事实证明，按照这个方针兴修水利，不但花钱很少，办得很多，而且进度很快，效果很好。这和过去单纯依靠国家投资，像群众所说的那样“政府修塘，群众帮忙”，“政府出钱，群众修塘”，结果花钱很多，兴办很少，进度很慢的情况成了一个鲜明的对照。
　　走群众路线，在工程规划和工具改良上有许多革新
    湖北省去冬今春的水利运动，由于充分地发动和依靠群众，自始至终贯彻执行了领导、技术、群众相结合的群众路线的工作方法，因而在水利工程的规划和工具改良上有许多创造性的革新。在规划上，由于襄阳专区均县、光化县的带动，许多地区的农业社都打破成规，充分地发挥了各种水源的灌溉效能，在过去未能很好地利用的河流溪涧上拦河筑坝，沿山开渠，沿渠修塘堰，河渠相连，渠堰相连，河渠塘堰连结成一大片完整的自流灌溉系统。有的渠道长达数百华里，和塘堰紧密的连结在一起，灌溉着一望无际的良田。因此有许多群众把渠道叫作西瓜藤，把堰塘叫作招待所。许多个这样规模壮阔的自流灌溉系统，都是在群众“自筹、自修、自用、自管理”的口号下，由群众自己修建起来的，既不需要国家大量投资，又不需要大量的工业器材，因此许许多多的工程都能在短时期内同时进行。在工具改良上，由于广大群众懂得了改良工具是节约劳动力的主要因素，同时采取了领导带头，个个献计，人人动手的工作方法，因而在宜昌专区当阳县跑马乡的带动下，一个群众性的改良工具运动也正在全省范围内逐步展开。当阳县到元月中旬为止，用在水利上的各种工具有二万零五百七十二件，十三天的时间，已节省劳动力五十七万二千八百多个，预计完成全部工程还可以再节约八十万个。现在抽出二万三千七百多人参加田间管理、副业和开荒，而水利规划却由原来的二百四十六万土方增加到六百一十万土方，到元月中旬已完成了二百五十六万土方。在那里，你可以看到天线运柴，吊杆运土，拖子、木轨斗车、履带运土、蛙式打硪架等几十种改良工具，而且这些工具都是就地取材，废物利用，不花一文钱。使用这些工具后，工效一般提高三倍，最高的达到十倍甚至二十倍。
    “天上满天星，地下万盏灯”，昼夜轮作，群众修水利的热情高涨
    群众兴修水利的热情和积极性也是历年来罕见的。在当前水利建设的高潮中，湖北省大部地区兴修水利的出勤率一般占全部劳动力的百分之六十至七十，在工程进入紧张的施工阶段，不少地区的半劳动力也参加工地的辅助劳动，因此出勤率有的达到百分之百。在随县的马鞍山水库，我们曾经看见有十三岁的姑娘笑容满面的在挑土筑坝。农民们在工地上，不分白天黑夜，在崖边水旁辛勤愉快地劳动，夜晚，工地上是“天上满天星，地下万盏灯”。尽管昼夜三班轮作，但群众的情绪仍然是十分饱满的，因为在党的领导和教育下，使他们深深地懂得了兴修水利是保证农业生产大跃进的关键，农业增产是农民改善生活的物质基础；党在具体领导上又采取了按照受益情况确定负担任务的互利政策，使他们把社会主义建设和个人利益紧密地结合起来，因此他们的情绪是高涨的，决心是坚强的。随县马鞍山水库的农民们提出“要把龙青寺变水晶宫”的口号，而且事实上，群众已经用自己的无穷无尽的力量把一座座的高山搬了家，把许多悬崖斩了腰，把许多河流改了道。在这些伟大成绩的面前，使我们更深的体会到党的领导英明正确，群众的智慧无穷无尽，劳动的伟大和光荣。
    争取在五年内消灭水、旱灾，推动农业生产上的更大跃进
    水利建设是农业生产的命脉，湖北省的广大农民群众在党中央的英明正确领导、全国各地的积极支援和自己的忘我的劳动下，取得了很大的成绩。这些成绩的取得决不是偶然的，是群众智慧和劳动的结晶，是领导和群众相结合的成果。湖北省的广大农民并没有满足于这些已经取得的成绩和胜利，他们正在通过参观评比，交换经验，互相学习，互相推动，继续不断地与山河作顽强的斗争。他们要以自己的智慧和勤劳的双手，改造河流、山谷，使水害变为水利，使荒地变为良田。他们将在党的领导下，进一步贯彻执行“依靠群众，勤俭治水”的水利工作方针，争取在五年内在全省范围消灭水、旱灾害，在胜利的基础上争取更大的胜利，推动全省农业生产的更大跃进。
    回想去年六、七月间，我们曾经在这个讲坛上愤怒的斥责了像章、章、罗、储、陈、黄、谭、龙等右派分子，也曾经举出了无数的事实来驳斥他们的反党、反人民、反社会主义的谎言与谬论。现在应当把这些右派分子带到大山区水利工程的工地上，让他们在轰轰烈烈的水利建设运动面前，再一次看到我们党的正确领导和人民群众的伟大创举，再一次认识自己的荒谬与无知，老老实实地在群众的监督和教育下改造自己，改过自新，重新做人。
