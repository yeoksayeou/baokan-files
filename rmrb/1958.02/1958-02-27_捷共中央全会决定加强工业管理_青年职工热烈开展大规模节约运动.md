Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 25th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported that the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held a plenary session here today.

    The sole item on the agenda was: to adopt new organizational and management measures for the Czechoslovak national economy. Prime Minister Široký delivered a report on this agenda item.

    The plenary session emphasized that in the past few months, when the broad masses of the people across the country discussed the resolutions of the Central Committee plenary session of the CPCz last year, tens of thousands of citizens expressed their views; the process and results of the discussions fully proved the correctness of the principles of organization and management of the national economy adopted by the Central Committee plenary sessions of the CPCz in February and September 1957. Based on this, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party unanimously adopted the "Principles on Improving the Economic Efficiency of Industrial and Construction Management" resolution.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 26th: A mass youth conservation movement has been fully launched in Czechoslovakia. This movement was initiated by the Czechoslovak Youth League at the end of last year, based on the initiative of youth organizations in some enterprises, in order to greet the upcoming 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, with the aim of helping the development of the national economy.

    So far, 3,560 youth organizations in enterprises across Czechoslovakia have participated in this movement. Young workers actively participate in socialist emulation, establish youth shock brigades and special inspection teams to check the conservation situation in their enterprises, and ensure that raw materials and other materials are saved as much as possible in production, improve product quality, and complete production plans ahead of schedule. In the Klement Gottwald Steel Plant in Kunčice, members of the youth organization proposed to guarantee savings of 2.5 million crowns. Now, through accelerating the comprehensive repair of two open-hearth furnaces and saving materials, as well as overfulfilling the January production targets and other measures, they have saved the state nearly one million crowns. In the Hulin machine manufacturing factory, young workers are planning to save 250,000 crowns by reducing the scrap rate and tool wear rate.

    To date, young workers across the country have saved the state more than 220 million crowns in this movement.

    In this movement, more and more young workers will also be mobilized and attracted to participate in the "Year of Improving Professional Skills" jointly organized by the Youth League, trade unions, and factory management to improve production technology. Significant progress has also been made in this area. So far, 742 enterprises across the country have launched a mass upsurge in improving production technology, with a total of 62,000 young people participating in this movement.

    捷共中央全会决定加强工业管理
    青年职工热烈开展大规模节约运动
    新华社布拉格25日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会今天在这里举行全体会议。
    会议的唯一议程是：通过捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的新组织和新管理措施。共和国总理西罗基就这项议程作了报告。
    全体会议着重指出，在过去几个月来全国广大人民讨论捷共中央去年全体会议的决议的时候，成千上万的公民发表了自己的观点；讨论的过程和结果完全证明1957年2月和9月捷共中央全会通过的关于国民经济的组织和管理原则的正确性。根据这一点，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会一致通过了“关于提高工业和建筑业管理的经济效能的原则”的决议。
    新华社布拉格26日电　一个群众性的青年大节约运动已经在捷克斯洛伐克全面展开。这个运动是去年年底捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟根据一些企业的青年组织的倡议，为了迎接今年将要召开的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会而发起的，目的是帮助国民经济的发展。
    到现在为止，捷克斯洛伐克全国企业中已经有三千五百六十个青年组织参加了这一运动。青年职工们积极参加社会主义竞赛，成立青年突击队和特别检查小组来检查本企业的节约情况，并且保证在生产中尽可能节约原料和其他物资，改进产品质量和提前完成生产计划。在孔齐泽的克利门特·哥特瓦尔德钢铁工厂中，青年组织的成员们提出保证节约二百五十万克朗，现在，他们通过加速两个平炉的全面修复工作和节约物资以及超额完成1月份生产指标等措施，已经为国家节约了将近一百万克朗。在胡林的机器制造工厂中，青年工人正在计划通过降低废品率和工具损耗率等办法来节约二十五万克朗。
    到目前为止，全国青年职工在这一运动中已经为国家节约了两亿二千多万克朗。
    在这个运动中，还要动员和吸引越来越多的青年工人参加青年联盟、工会和工厂管理方面共同组织的“提高专业技术年”，以提高生产技术。运动在这方面也取得了重大的进展。到目前为止，全国已经有七百四十二个企业展开了群众性的提高生产技术的热潮，总共有六万二千名青年参加了这一运动。
