 Had to Launch On the Spot
    The American "Thor," "Vanguard," and several other rocket experiments have failed. These rockets all have one thing in common: after being launched, they fall back to the vicinity of the launch site. But recently, many American military and political leaders have been bragging about how American missile weapons have the power to destroy the Soviet Union. It seems that the United States can only achieve this by establishing its missile launch sites in the Soviet Union.

    只好就地发射
    美国的“雷神”、“先锋”等好几种火箭试验失败，这些火箭都有一个特点，就是发射之后落回到发射地点附近。但是最近还有不少美国的军政首领在吹牛，说什么美国的导弹武器有着摧毁苏联的力量。看来美国只有把它的这些导弹的发射场建立在苏联才办得到了。
