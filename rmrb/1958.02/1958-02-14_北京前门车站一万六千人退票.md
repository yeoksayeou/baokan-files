    Beijing Qianmen Railway Station Registers 16,000 Ticket Returns
    Workers say: The New Year can be celebrated in any way, home can be returned to at any time, but the nation's construction speed cannot be delayed for even a moment.
    (Our report) Following the publication of this newspaper's editorial "Break Conventions and Celebrate the Spring Festival," many workers in the capital who had purchased train tickets to return home for the Spring Festival voluntarily returned their tickets. They said, "The New Year can be celebrated in any way, home can be returned to at any time, but the nation's construction speed cannot be delayed for even a moment."
    In previous years, the ticket offices at Beijing Railway Station were crowded with passengers before the Spring Festival. This year, the ticket offices are also crowded, and the lines are very long, but the people lining up are not buying tickets, but returning them. The temporary ticket return office at Qianmen Railway Station has been increased from the original one to eleven, and more than twenty cadres have been assigned to do temporary ticket return work. From February 6th to 13th, the Qianmen Station ticket return office collected a total of 16,000 tickets. On the 12th alone, 3,223 tickets were returned, including 200 tickets returned by a worker representative from the Beijing Paper Mill.

    北京前门车站一万六千人退票
    职工们说：年怎样都可过，家什么时候都可回，国家的建设速度一时一刻也不能落后。
    本报讯　本报发表“打破常规过春节”的社论后，首都许多买了火车票准备回家过春节的职工都自动退了票。他们说：“年怎样都可以过，家什么时候都可以回，可是国家的建设速度一时一刻也不能落后。”
    往年的春节前夕，北京车站售票处的旅客拥挤，今年售票处也很拥挤，队伍也排得很长，但排队的人不是买车票，而是退票。前门车站的临时退票处已从原来的一处增加到十一处，二十多个干部被派做临时退票工作。从2月6日起至13日，前门站退票处收回的车票共一万六千张。12日一天就收回三千二百二十三张，其中北京造纸厂一位工人代表就退了二百张。
