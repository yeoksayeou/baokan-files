We fully agree with the various reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Director Wu Yuzhang, etc., and suggest that the Congress approve them. Now we would like to raise some opinions on overseas Chinese affairs and the development of aquatic products.

The current issue for overseas Chinese is mainly to resolve the issue of dual nationality, that is, the vast number of overseas Chinese currently residing abroad should, based on the principle of voluntariness, dispel concerns, acquire local nationality, live and work in peace and contentment in their host countries, actively cooperate and coexist peacefully with the local people, and jointly strive for the peace, happiness, and prosperity of their host countries, thereby helping to promote friendly relations between the motherland and their host countries. These issues have already been mentioned in Director He Xiangning's speech, and we will not repeat them except to express our full agreement.

Some overseas Chinese have no relatives to turn to when they return to China and need resettlement. Entering lakes and the sea will be one of the main ways out for returned overseas Chinese.

However, among the tens of millions of overseas Chinese scattered in more than fifty countries, some may have to return to their motherland for various reasons, and some of them have no home to return to in the motherland, no relatives to turn to, and even do not know where their original home is. The motherland must come up with appropriate ways to receive, accommodate, and resettle them. This mainly involves arranging them to participate in agricultural production, or farms in Hainan Island, Fujian, and Guangdong. This way out is relatively broad and feasible. However, it must be pointed out that in the past, not everyone could understand this issue. For example, in the past, there were some conservative ideas that said: there are too many people in the country, and there is no room for placement, so it is better for fewer overseas Chinese to return. Indeed, most overseas Chinese abroad do not want to return. If the issue of dual nationality can be properly resolved, those overseas Chinese who do not need to return can live and work in peace and contentment in their host countries, then the number of people returning may not be large. But the problem is not that simple, and we must not rely solely on one-sided plans. If some overseas Chinese have to return for various reasons, what should we do? Therefore, we would rather prepare in advance.

Is the method of accommodation and resettlement only the one mentioned above? We don't think so.

Now is the era of socialism, and also the era of atomic energy. The creativity of the people is great. Since the door to the atomic nucleus has been opened, the power of matter is endless; similarly, once the high tide of socialist production in our country develops, places that used to complain that there were too few outlets and too many people now have too many outlets and a shortage of labor. For example, the hometowns of overseas Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong, which were said to have little land and many people in the past, are now full of bright avenues. In addition to going to the countryside and up the mountains, they can also enter lakes and the sea. Indeed, accommodating future returned overseas Chinese by entering lakes and the sea will be one of the main ways out. Therefore, from this perspective, we would like to talk about the issue of aquatic products based on lakes and the sea.

(1)
Both freshwater aquaculture and marine fisheries have great potential, and "tidal flat aquaculture" can also be widely promoted.

According to materials from relevant departments of aquatic products, the total output of various aquatic products in our country in 1957 is estimated to be only 2.95 million tons. This quantity is too small, averaging only nine catties per person per year for the national population of over 600 million. But on the other hand, our country has very rich aquatic resources: the coastline is as long as 11,000 kilometers; the nearby sea area is several million square kilometers; the inland lake and pond area is about 160 million mu (excluding large lakes and rivers), of which at least 60 million mu can be used for fish farming, and only 15 million mu are currently utilized, and most of the rest is still barren.

Our country has good climatic conditions, and aquatic products grow and reproduce rapidly. In terms of freshwater aquaculture, the experience and technology accumulated by Chinese fishermen over a long period of time have cultivated many excellent fish species that grow rapidly and have a very high survival rate, such as grass carp, silver carp, bream, mud carp, and carp. The yield is extremely high when farmed in fish ponds and lakes. For example, Nanhai and Shunde in Guangdong, and Haicang in Fujian, have yields as high as 1,500 to 1,950 catties per mu, and the general average is also 500 to 600 catties. If the above-mentioned 45 million mu of undeveloped lakes and ponds can be gradually fully farmed, it is possible to increase fish production by several million tons to 10 million tons (worth 2-3 billion yuan) per year. Currently, the national freshwater fish production is only 1 million tons, and the average yield is very low, so the potential for increasing production is also very large.

In terms of marine fisheries, our country, from the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea in the north to the East China Sea and the South China Sea in the south, are all excellent fishing grounds. At present, state-owned aquatic product companies alone have more than 400 motorized fishing vessels, but they are generally small ships of about 100 tons. More than 400,000 civilian fishing boats are all wooden sailing boats, which are inefficient and cannot sail far. Chinese fishermen are experienced, and the coastal labor force is abundant. With the high enthusiasm for production in the future, the potential for developing the ocean should be said to be infinite.

In terms of the "tidal flat aquaculture" of coastal bays and beaches, our country has a mild coastal climate, and all coasts from north to south are extremely suitable for developing aquatic product aquaculture. For example, kelp, abalone, scallop, and sea cucumber, which are of extremely high economic value, and oysters (i.e., oysters), which have extremely high nutritional value and are known as the "king of aquatic food," can be artificially farmed almost everywhere. The sea cucumber in Liaodong Peninsula is one of the delicacies in food, and 12 species can be propagated in the southern Fujian coast in experiments; another example is the kelp that has been farmed in Shandong Peninsula, because it contains iodine, it can prevent and treat thyroid diseases, and is loved by people in mountainous inland areas. The annual supply to the whole country reaches 10 million catties (calculated as dried product), but it still cannot meet the needs of people in mountainous areas, and part of it has to be purchased with foreign exchange. Now, kelp has been successfully planted in Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian, and can be widely promoted on the coasts of the three provinces, saving foreign exchange for the country, earning foreign exchange, and meeting the needs of people in mountainous areas.

Everyone knows that developing aquatic products has several benefits: First, it increases national economic income; second, it increases the supply of non-staple foods, effectively solving the difficulties in the supply of non-staple foods caused by the continuous improvement of people's living standards; third, it promotes national health, because aquatic products are generally more nutritious, have high protein content, and are rich in vitamins; fourth, it can play an auxiliary role in consolidating national defense, such as cultivating pilots who are familiar with water conditions and strengthening the masses' awareness and work in defending the coast; fifth, it opens up another broad outlet for employment for coastal people; sixth, agricultural cooperatives developing freshwater fish farming can increase income and open up sources of fertilizer (pond mud); and finally, it can bring about the prosperous development of the food processing industry, expand sources of export goods and foreign exchange income. For all these benefits, we should vigorously develop the aquatic product industry.

According to the aquatic product development and production targets reported by the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the plan for 1958 is to reach 3.52 million tons, 8 million tons in 1962, and the third five-year plan will have a great leap forward, which can probably be doubled again. Although our fisheries base is relatively thin, the potential is great. We believe that as long as the Party, the government, and the people pay close attention and give more support, it is highly likely that this target will be completed or exceeded.

(2)
Vigorously develop freshwater aquaculture and tidal flat aquaculture, gradually develop marine fishing, and improve fishing techniques.

How should we work hard? We believe that the current direction for developing aquatic products should be: focusing on vigorously developing freshwater aquaculture and tidal flat aquaculture, while gradually developing marine fishing and improving fishing techniques.

First, vigorously develop the aquaculture industry in inland freshwater lakes and barren ponds. The current conditions make this very possible. After eight years of efforts, state-owned aquatic product institutions have made great achievements in the capture, cultivation, transportation, sales, and supply of freshwater fish fry (the main sources are the lower reaches of the Xijiang River and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River), and the promotion of fish farming technology knowledge, but they still need to gradually strengthen their work to be able to cope adequately. In addition to the above-mentioned natural freshwater lakes and ponds, in the current high tide of agricultural leap forward, tens of thousands of mountain ponds and reservoirs built across the country in water conservancy projects must be used as much as possible as an important part of the sideline business of agricultural cooperatives.

Second, actively develop beaches and bays, and vigorously carry out tidal flat aquaculture. Focus on kelp and oysters, supplemented by other products such as abalone, clams, cockles, scallops, and sea cucumbers, so that all coasts become areas that produce wealth.

In the development of beaches, we can also pay attention to the development of sand fields and salt fields. Because of the small land and large population along the coasts of Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces, they have always had experience in building dikes to create salt fields, and using silt to fill and create sand fields and salt fields, and simultaneously intercepting fish with the ebb and flow of tides. Competing with the sea for land, while fishing, solves production and employment. This direction, in terms of returned overseas Chinese investment and resettlement employment, should be vigorously promoted. The people of Fujian and Guangdong are rich in this experience, and are easy to advocate.

Third, develop marine fisheries in a planned and step-by-step manner. This requires relatively large and relatively concentrated investment, but in order to lay a good foundation for the long-term development of marine fisheries, to carry out long-term accumulation of means of production, technical personnel, and technical knowledge, it is still necessary to continue to pay active attention.

The development of fisheries is inseparable from the reform of technology. Now, more than 90% of the tonnage of fishing boats in the country are sailboats. If we do not focus on reform and gradually equip them with small motors to become motorized sailboats, our cooperative fisheries cannot extend from the coast to the ocean. As a result, in addition to a small number of larger sailboats, we can only engage in fishing in the near-sea fishing areas, which excessively damages the fishing resources. If this situation is not taken seriously and changed, then the higher the enthusiasm of the fishermen for fishing, the closer our fishing resources may be to exhaustion. This is a serious problem that must be given full attention. The depletion of coastal fishing resources in many parts of Japan is due to this reason, which can serve as a lesson. Therefore, we suggest that more attention should be paid to the work of improving equipment, and that it should be done more boldly, more, better, faster, and more economically, instead of delaying the date.

Finally, as with the general experience of developing production, to develop marine fisheries more, faster, better, and more economically, we must correct the kind of unrealistic and ambitious idea that when planning, it is "fish detectors," "radiotelephones," "near-code docks," and "complete sets of equipment." We should be realistic and seek the simpler, most economical methods that can be implemented immediately. If there is not enough diesel, we will use steam engines. If modern large docks cannot be built immediately, we will first build simple ice factories, crude processing equipment, and necessary coal yards and oil depots. Japan is a capitalist country, and they can still overcome some difficulties in this regard; with our superior socialist system and the people's high enthusiasm, we do not believe that the current difficulties cannot be overcome.

(3)
Rely on and mobilize the masses, strive for a leap forward in fisheries, and guide overseas Chinese investment in fisheries and resettle returned overseas Chinese for employment.

In the great socialist construction of our country, are there any difficulties in the great task of developing aquatic products? It should be said that there are. First of all, we need production capital. Roughly estimated, the annual investment needs to be a huge figure of several billion yuan. What should we do? Will it affect investment in other areas? We believe that if we can properly understand the spirit of overall planning and appropriate arrangements taught by Chairman Mao, it can be resolved.

First, we must strengthen planning leadership, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses to develop fisheries. The total number of people in the fisheries population in our country is about 4.5 million. They are both diligent and brave, and also have rich experience and skills. Under the support and leadership of the Party and the government after liberation, relying on mutual assistance and cooperation, not only has their lives been significantly improved, but also, according to estimates, the public accumulation of fishermen across the country has been approximately 8 billion yuan or more in the past eight years. Especially offshore fishermen, such as the Guangao Township Fisheries Cooperative in Chaoyang County, Guangdong, had an average income of more than 1,000 yuan per laborer in 1957 (some fishing households earned 6,000 to 7,000 yuan last year). A total of more than 500 new buildings have been built in the township. It is believed that there are many outstanding advanced fisheries cooperatives to varying degrees throughout the country, which shows the prosperity of marine fisheries, and also shows that the possibility of mobilizing the masses, tapping potential, expanding reproduction, and reforming technology is very high. As for freshwater aquaculture fisheries, the increase in production after liberation has also made great progress. A large part of the fishermen in the Foshan area of Guangdong (mainly the "mulberry dike-fish pond area") now live a "three teas and two meals" life (eating miscellaneous food in tea houses three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, and eating rice at home twice). The public accumulation of cooperatives is also very large. As mentioned above, there is still a large area of ​​freshwater in the country that has not been developed, which is mainly concentrated in the Huaihe, Canal, and the two lakes area of ​​the ancient Yunmeng Daze, but the mountain ponds and reservoirs created by the current high tide of agricultural leap forward are spread all over every corner of the country. Relying on the masses, relying on cooperatives, and actively and extensively developing the sideline business of aquaculture should be achievable. Last year, agricultural cooperatives in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, even used more than 100,000 mu of non-navigable river ports to raise fish as a sideline business. In addition, advanced experiences such as "tidal flat aquaculture" and "mulberry dike-fish pond" should be vigorously promoted by aquatic product departments.

The "going to the countryside and up the mountains" to develop agriculture, and the "trying every means and working hard for three years" which is a political and historical revolution and upsurge in production, which is now a sensation across the country, we suggest that it should be timely combined with the development of aquatic products, and that fish farming should be promoted to all lakes large and small, mountain ponds, reservoirs, disconnected and stagnant rivers, deep seas and shallow bays, so that fisheries can flourish in large quantities in all the three mountains, five lakes, four seas, and nine provinces of the motherland. This mainly relies on the combination of the leadership of the Party and the government and the strength of the masses, taking advantage of the current high tide of production enthusiasm, to create a great leap forward in fisheries.

Second, regarding the issue of resettling returned overseas Chinese for employment and guiding overseas Chinese relatives and overseas Chinese to invest in fisheries, we believe that because the hometowns of overseas Chinese are mainly in the coastal and riverine provinces, many have fisheries common sense and have the habit of using fish as a major non-staple food. In many areas of Southeast Asia, overseas Chinese actively participate in fisheries. It is recommended that relevant departments in various regions conduct planning and guidance, focusing on freshwater aquaculture and tidal flat aquaculture during the second five-year plan. Small and medium-sized enterprises can cooperate and invest with fisheries and agricultural cooperatives, and appropriately use certain preferential incentive methods that are currently effective (such as guaranteeing principal and interest, or appropriately increasing the supply of aquatic food and resettling employment to investors, etc.), large enterprises can combine with the existing state-owned overseas Chinese investment companies. Other diverse ways such as joint public-private ventures or joining fisheries cooperatives can also be planned and guided. In addition to developing aquatic products to support economic construction, these measures can solve the employment of some returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, increase the supply of non-staple foods in overseas Chinese hometowns, prosper the economy of overseas Chinese hometowns, and increase the income of cooperatives. It can be said that this is completely urgently needed in the current overseas Chinese hometowns.

In addition, in order to encourage the active development of fisheries production, aquatic product departments should always pay attention to: 1. Adjusting the difference between the purchase price and the market sales price of aquatic products to avoid too much difference; 2. Increasing fishing port facilities (such as cold storage, processing, transportation, etc.); 3. Guiding aquaculture in new production areas and reforms in old production areas; 4. Supplying fish fry, etc.

    让五湖四海为祖国发展水产
    庄希泉　丘及　陈其瑗　庄明理  吴益修　蚁美厚　伍禅　黄长水周铮　张翼　廖承志　方君壮  吴桓兴　洪丝丝　代表的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任等分别所作的各项报告，并建议大会予以通过。现在就一些华侨问题和发展水产问题提出意见。
    国外华侨的当前问题，主要是解决双重国籍问题，即是，现在居留在国外的广大华侨，应该根据自愿原则、解除顾虑，取得当地国籍，在所在国安居乐业，和当地人民积极合作，友好共处，共同为所在国的和平幸福繁荣而努力，从而有助于促进祖国和所在国的友好关系。关于这些问题，已经在何香凝主任的发言中提及，我们除了极表同意之外，不再重复了。
    部分华侨回国无亲可投，需要安置，入湖出海将是归侨主要出路之一。
    但是，散布在海外五十多国的千余万华侨，可能有一部分由于种种原因，必须归回自己的祖国，其中又有一些是在祖国无家可归、无亲可投，甚且不知原籍在那里的，祖国必须想出适当办法，予以接待、收容安置。这主要是安置参加农业生产，或海南岛、福建、广东的农场，这一条出路是比较广阔可行的。然而，必须指出，过去对这个问题，并不是人人都想的通，例如过去就有些保守的想法说：国内人口太多了，没有安插余地，因此华侨最好还是少回来一些。的确，国外华侨并不会大部分都想回来的。如果双重国籍问题能够获得妥善解决，那些可以不回来的华侨，能够在当地安居乐业，那末，回来的人也可能不多。但是问题不是那末简单，我们决不能只依靠片面的打算，如果有一部分华侨由于种种原因必须回来，怎么办呢？因此我们还是宁可预作准备。
    是不是收容安置的办法只有上面所说的一条呢？我们看不是这样。
    现在是社会主义的时代，同时又是原子能的时代，人民的创造性是伟大的。原子核的门路既经打开，物质的能力就无穷无尽；同样，我国的社会主义生产高潮一经发展，过去嫌出路太少、人太多的地方、现在却是出路太多、劳动力不足。如过去说是地少人多的华侨家乡福建和广东，现在则处处是光明大道，除了下乡上山之外，还可以入湖、出海。的确，收容今后回国的华侨，入湖出海将是主要出路之一。因此我们从这个角度，想来谈一谈以湖海为基地的水产问题。
    （一）
    淡水养殖和海洋渔业潜力都大，“海涂养殖业”也可以大量推广。
    根据水产有关部门的材料，我国各种水产的总产量，一九五七年预计只有二百九十五万吨。这数量是太少了，以全国六亿多人口平均计算，每人每年只有九斤。但另方面，我国拥有非常丰富的水产资源：海岸线长达一万一千公里；附近的海洋面积数百万平方公里；内地的湖泊水塘面积约一亿六千万亩（大湖及江河不计在内），其中可以养鱼的最少有六千万亩，目前只利用了一千五百万亩，此外大部分还荒废着。
    我国气候条件良好，水产生长繁殖迅速。就淡水养殖渔业来说：我国渔民长期积累下来的经验技术，已经培养有许多生长迅速，成活率极高的优良鱼种，如鲩、鳙、鳊、鲮、鲤等，在鱼塘湖泊中养殖，产量极高。例如广东的南海、顺德，福建的海仓，有的产量高到每亩一千五百斤至一千九百五十斤，一般平均也有五、六百斤，如果上述尚未开发的湖泊水塘四千五百万亩能够逐渐充分养殖，每年增加鱼产数百万吨到一千万吨（值二、三十亿元），是有可能的。目前全国淡水鱼产量只有一百万吨，平均产量很低，增产潜力也很大。
    就海洋渔业来说：我国北起渤海、黄海，南至东海、南海，都是优良渔场。目前我国仅国营水产公司拥有机动渔轮四百多艘，但一般只是百吨上下的小型船。民用渔船四十多万艘则全部都是木帆船，效率不高，不能远航。我国渔民经验丰富，沿海劳动力充足，加以今后生产积极性高涨，发展海洋的潜力，应该说是无穷大的。
    再就沿海海湾海滩的“海涂养殖业”来说：我国沿海气候温和，从北到南所有海岸都极适合发展水产养殖业，例如经济价值极高的海带、鲍鱼、江瑶柱、海参，营养价值极高、号称“水产食品之王”的蚝（即牡犡），几乎各地都可以人工养殖。辽东半岛的海参，是食中珍品之一，在南方福建海岸试验，已有十二种可以繁殖；又如山东半岛已养殖的海带，因含有碘质，可以防治甲状腺病，为山区内地人民所爱吃，全国每年供应量达一千万斤（以干品计），但还远远不能满足山区人民的需要，一部分要以外汇购入，现在在浙江广东福建已经试植海带成功，可以在三省海岸大量推广，为国家节省外汇，并且争取外汇，和满足山区人民要求。
    大家知道，发展水产有好几种好处：一、增加国民经济收入；二、增加副食品供应，有力地解决由于人民生活不断提高所引起的副食品供应上的困难；三、促进民族健康，因为水产品一般营养比较丰富，蛋白质量高，维生素又多；四、可以对巩固国防起辅助作用，例如培养熟识水性的领港人才，加强群众保卫海防的思想和工作；五、为沿海人民就业展开另一广大出路；六、农业社发展淡水养鱼业，可以增加收入及开辟肥料来源（塘泥）；最后是可以带来了食品加工工业的繁荣发展，扩大出口货源和外汇收入。为了这种种利益，我们应该大力发展水产事业。
    根据水产部报告的我国水产发展生产指标，一九五八年计划达到三百五十二万吨，一九六二年达到八百万吨，第三个五年计划还将有很大的跃进，大约可以再增一倍。我们渔业基底虽然比较薄，但潜力则很大。我们认为，只要党、政府和人民给予密切的注意和更多的支持，完成或超额完成这个指标的可能性很大。
    （二）
    大力发展淡水养殖和海涂养殖，逐步发展海洋捕捞，改进捕鱼技术。
    应该怎样努力呢？我们认为，当前发展水产的方向应该是：以大力发展淡水养殖及海涂养殖为主，同时逐步发展海洋捕捞，改进捕鱼技术。
    第一，大力发展内陆淡水湖泊、荒塘的养殖业，当前条件是很有可能的。经过八年来的努力，国营水产机构对于淡水鱼苗的捕捞、培养、运销、供应（主要来源是西江下游和长江的中下游），养鱼技术知识的推广，成绩很大，但还需要逐步加强工作才能足够应付。除了上述的天然淡水湖塘之外，在当前农业大跃进的高潮当中，全国各地在兴修水利所造成的数以十万计的山塘水库，都要尽量利用，作为农业社的重要副业的一部分。
    第二，积极开发海滩海湾，大力进行海涂养殖。以海带及牡犡为主，其他如鲍鱼、蚶、蛏、江瑶柱、海参等为辅，使所有海岸都成为生产财富之区。
    在开发海滩当中，可以同时注意到发展沙田、塭田的工作。由于福建、广东、浙江各省沿海地少人多，一向有筑堤造塭，和利用淤积填造沙田塭田，同时每随潮汐涨落而进行拦捕鱼类的经验。与海争地，同时捕鱼，解决生产与就业。这一方向，在归国华侨投资与安置就业方面来看，尤其应该大力提倡。福建、广东一带人民富有这项经验，驾轻就熟，易于倡召。
    第三，有计划、有步骤地发展海洋渔业。这一项需要比较大量和比较集中的投资，但是为了替长远发展海洋渔业打好基础，进行长期的积累生产资料、技术人才和技术知识，仍然是有必要继续积极注意的。
    发展渔业与改革技术是不可分割的。现在全国渔船吨位百分之九十以上是帆船，如果不着重改革、逐渐以小型马达装备成为机帆船，我们的合作化渔业，就不能由沿海伸张到海洋，结果除小部分较大帆船之外，只能在近海的渔源区中从事捕捞，过度伤害了渔源。这一情况如果不重视和加以改变，那末，渔民捕捞的积极性越高，我们的渔源就可能会愈接近穷尽。这是一个严重问题，必须予以充分注意。日本许多地方沿海渔源的枯竭，就是由于这个原因，可以作为殷鉴。因此，我们建议对改进装备的工作应该给予更多的重视，再放手些，再做得多、好、快、省些，而不要再迁延时日。
    最后，和发展生产的一般经验一样，要更多、更快、更好、更省地发展海洋渔业，就必须纠正那种好高骛远，一提计划就是“鱼群探测器”、“报话机”、“近代码头”、“全套设备”的想法，而应实事求是，首先求取较简单，最省钱，而现在就可以立即兴办的办法。如果柴油不足，我们就用蒸气发动机。如果近代大码头马上搞不起来，就先搞简单的制冰厂，粗陋的加工设备，和必需的煤栈油库。日本是资本主义国家，他们这方面尚且还能克服一些困难；凭着我们优越的社会主义制度和人民的高度积极性，我们不相信目前的困难是无法克服的。
    （三）
    依靠和发动群众，争取渔业大跃进，辅导华侨投资渔业安置归侨就业。
    在我国社会主义大建设当中，发展水产的伟大任务有没有困难呢？应该说是有的，首先是要生产资本。粗略估计，每年的投资要有好几亿元的庞大数字，怎么办呢？不会影响其他方面的投资吗？我们认为，如果好好地体会毛主席教训的统筹兼顾，适当安排的精神，是可以解决的。
    第一，要加强规划领导，依靠群众、动员群众发展渔业。我国渔业人口总数约四百五十万，他们是既勤劳又勇敢，同时又具有丰富经验和技巧的。解放后在党和政府的扶持领导下，依靠互助合作，不但生活已有显著提高，并且，据估计，八年来全国渔民的公共积累大约有八亿元以上。尤其是出海渔民，如广东潮阳县的广澳乡渔业社，一九五七年每个劳动力平均收入有一千多元（去年有的渔户一家收入六、七千元）。全乡新建楼房共达到五百多座。全国各地不同程度的突出的先进渔业社，相信为数不少，说明了海洋渔业的兴旺，也说明了动员群众、发掘潜力、扩大再生产和改革技术的可能性是很高的。至于淡水养殖渔业，解放后增产情况也有很大的进展。广东佛山专区（主要是“桑基鱼塘区”）的渔民现在有很大部分是“三茶两饭”过日子（每天早、午、晚上茶楼吃杂食三次，在家吃大米饭两次）。合作社的公共积累也很大。如上所述，全国尚有广大面积的淡水未曾开发，这主要集中在江淮、运河及古云梦大泽的两湖地区，但当前农业跃进高潮所造成的山塘水库，则遍布到全国每个角落，依靠群众、依靠合作社、积极广泛地发展养殖水产的副业，应该是做得到的。广东珠江三角洲新会县的农业社，去年甚至利用一些不通航运的河港十多万亩来养鱼，作为副业。此外“海涂养殖”、“桑基鱼塘”等先进经验，都应该通过水产部门大力推广。
    现在轰动全国的“下乡上山”发展农业、“千方百计、苦干三年”的富有政治性、历史性的革命和增产高潮，我们建议应该及时结合到发展水产方面来，把养鱼事业推广到所有大小湖泊、山塘、水库、断港绝潢、深海浅湾，让渔业在祖国所有的三山、五湖、四海、九州都大量繁荣起来。这主要依靠党和政府的领导与群众的力量相结合，趁着当前生产积极性热火朝天的高潮，来一个渔业大跃进。
    第二，关于安置归国华侨就业和辅导侨眷及华侨投资于渔业问题，我们认为，由于华侨家乡主要是在沿海沿江各省，很多是有渔业常识，并有以鱼为主要副食品的习惯。东南亚有许多地区的渔业，华侨都活跃的参加。建议各地有关部门进行规划及辅导，在第二个五年计划期间，以淡水养殖及海涂养殖为主，中、小型企业可以与渔、农合作社合作投资，适当利用某些现刻已经行之有效的优待奖励办法（如保本保息，或对投资者适当增加供应水产食品和安置就业等），大型企业可以结合现有的国营华侨投资公司来做。其他如公私合营、或参加渔业合作社等多种多样方式都可以进行规划辅导。这些措施除了可以发展水产支持经济建设之外，并可以解决部分归侨侨眷的就业，增加侨乡副食品的供应，繁荣侨乡经济和增加合作社收入。应该可以说，这在目前的侨乡，完全是迫切需要的。
    此外为了鼓励渔业生产的积极发展，水产部门应该经常注意：一、调整水产品的收购与市场销售的产销差价，不使相差太大；二、增加渔港设备（如冷藏、加工、运输等）；三、辅导新产区的养殖，旧产区的改革；四、供应鱼苗等。
