Xinhua News Agency, London, February 7th: Labour Party foreign policy spokesman Aneurin Bevan said in an article in the "Tribune" weekly on the 7th that Bulganin's nine-point proposals for a summit meeting offered the prospect of reaching a fairly broad and important agreement. He asked Western countries to "accept this proposal as an agenda and not insist on raising issues that are known to be unacceptable to the Russians." Because "in the eyes of most rational people, the Russian attitude is more reasonable in all circumstances." He called for an agreement between East and West to reduce distrust, "no matter how limited the agreement."

Bevan also said: Since his talks with Khrushchev in Yalta last fall, he has always believed that "the Russians were and still are very concerned about the urgent need for the great powers to try again to ease the Cold War."

On the issue of East-West summit talks, the conservative "Daily Express" pointed out that a poll published in the newspaper not long ago showed that 83% of British people were in favor of holding East-West summit talks. However, some people in Britain are conducting propaganda against holding this meeting. The newspaper asked British Prime Minister Macmillan "not to listen to the opinions of these cowards" and should "go forward courageously to participate in this meeting, because the people of the whole country have clearly expressed their hope that this meeting will be held."

　　比万欢迎布尔加宁新建议
    绝大多数英国人赞成最高级会谈
    新华社伦敦7日电　英国工党外交政策发言人比万在7日的“论坛”周报上发表文章说，布尔加宁关于举行最高级会议的九点建议提供了达成相当广泛、相当重要的协议的前景。他要求西方国家“接受这个建议作为议程，而不要坚持提出明知不能为俄国人接受的问题。”因为“在大多数有理性的人看来，俄国人的态度在一切情况下都是比较通情达理的”。他要求东西方之间设法达成协议以减少不信任，“不管是多么有限的协议”。
    比万还说：自从他去年秋天在雅尔塔同赫鲁晓夫会谈以来，他一直相信，“俄国人过去是，现在仍然是很重视大国再次设法缓和冷战这种迫切需要的。”
    保守的“每日快报”在东西方最高级会谈问题上指出，不久以前在该报上所发表的民意测验结果表明，83％的英国人赞成举行东西方最高级会谈。但是，英国某些人士正在进行反对召开这一会议的宣传活动。报纸要求英国首相麦克米伦“不应该听这些懦夫们的意见”，而应该“勇往直前地去参加这次会议，因为，全国人民都明白地表示希望举行这次会议”。
