Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 17th—Four bright red peonies at Wangcheng Park in Luoyang blossomed just before the Spring Festival. Azaleas, magnolias, Nymphaea tetragona, Prunus persica, chrysanthemums, and other flowers that do not usually bloom in winter are now all in full bloom here. Peony buds are also about to open.

These flowers are all the result of careful cultivation. Li Chengshan, an old gardener at Wangcheng Park, has more than forty years of experience in flower cultivation, but he had never imagined that peonies could bloom in winter. In the early winter of last year, with the encouragement and support of relevant leaders, he worked diligently and finally made peonies, azaleas, and other flowers bloom in winter. During the New Year's Day holiday, one peony had already bloomed and faded once, and near the Spring Festival, two more bloomed magnificently. The old gardener excitedly told visitors admiring the flowers: "Breaking with convention makes everything possible; planting flowers without fearing hardship; with ideals and determination, even harsh winter can bring a hundred flowers to bloom."

    有了理想和决心　严冬也能百花开
    洛阳牡丹、杜鹃怒放
    新华社洛阳17日电　洛阳王城公园的红牡丹，在春节前夕开放了四朵鲜艳的大红花。冬天不开花的杜鹃、玉兰花、子午莲、碧桃花、菊花等现在都在这里一齐怒放。芍药花儿也正在含苞待开。
    这些花儿都是经过人工精心培育的。王城公园老花工李成山已有四十多年的栽花经验，但叫牡丹在冬天开花，过去他根本未曾设想。去年初冬，他得到有关领导人的鼓励和支持，经过辛勤劳动，终于使牡丹、杜鹃等花在冬天开放。在元旦期间，已有一株牡丹开谢一次，临近春节又有两株盛开。这个老花工兴奋地对赏花的游人说：打破常规事事在，不计辛苦把花栽，有了理想加决心，严冬也能百花开。
