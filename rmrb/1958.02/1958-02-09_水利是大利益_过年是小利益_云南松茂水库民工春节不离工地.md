Water Conservancy is a Major Interest, Celebrating the New Year is a Minor Interest
Yunnan Songmao Reservoir Laborers Stay on the Construction Site During Spring Festival

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Yunnan Daily reports: The laborers at the Songmao Reservoir in Chenggong County, Yunnan Province, have challenged all water conservancy construction laborers in the province by setting "No Leaving the Construction Site During the Spring Festival" as a condition. In order to complete the reservoir project before the flood season, they have decided not to leave the construction site during the Spring Festival, guaranteeing that the entire project will be completed ahead of schedule on March 20th.

　　Upon completion, this reservoir project will increase irrigation for 35,000 mu of land. The project was originally planned to be completed in two years, but it is now estimated that it can be completed within one year. However, to complete this medium-sized reservoir with a large workload and high quality requirements ahead of schedule within a short period, it is necessary to increase the labor force to ensure success; and considering the labor force situation in the whole county, it is difficult to increase the labor force any further.

　　Many laborers were already aware of this tense labor situation, and they were already thinking about how to overcome this difficulty. Li Rongshun (poor peasant), a laborer from the Gujiang Agricultural Cooperative's team, said to the head of the command: "I have a suggestion, it is best not to leave the construction site during the Spring Festival, and we can show the same spirit as when we went to work on the second day of the lunar new year during the transition to the advanced cooperative in 1956." Many team leaders and squad leaders are also discussing that the engineering task is so urgent that if the laborers return home for the Spring Festival, we must stay here and persist until the end. Based on these positive suggestions and the spirit of increasing work efficiency required by the higher-level Party committee, the person in charge of the construction site headquarters put forward the call to "Not leave the construction site during the Spring Festival."

　　This call was immediately enthusiastically supported by Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and the majority of laborers. Communist Party member Li Zeng said: "We came to build water conservancy to complete the reservoir as soon as possible, and to complete the major interests of the entire county, the minor interests of celebrating the New Year can be completely abandoned." Poor peasant Li Xingyi said: "In the past, I borrowed New Year rice from the landlord, and I was still helping him release water into the fields on New Year's Eve. Now that we are working for ourselves, we are happy even if we don't celebrate a few New Years."

### 水利是大利益　过年是小利益  云南松茂水库民工春节不离工地

　　水利是大利益　过年是小利益
    云南松茂水库民工春节不离工地
    本报讯　云南日报消息：云南省呈贡县松茂水库的民工们，以“春节不离工地”为条件，向全省水利建设的民工挑战。他们为了使水库工程赶在洪水前完成，决定春节不离工地，保证全部工程在3月20日提前完工。
    这个水库工程完成后，可增灌三万五千亩地。这个工程原计划两年完工，现在估计一年内即可完成。但是，要在短期内使这个工程量大、质量要求特高的中型水库提早完工，还需要增加一批劳动力才有把握；而从全县的劳动力的情况来看，要再增加劳动力是有困难的。
    这种劳动力紧张的实际状况，早被许多民工看在心里，他们已在为如何来克服这一困难想办法动脑筋。古江农业社中队的民工李荣顺（贫农）向指挥部的负责人说：“我提个意见，最好过春节不要离工地，可以拿出像1956年转高级社时，大年初二就出工干活计的劲头来。”许多中队长、分队长也在纷纷议论，工程任务这样紧，如果过春节民工回去了，我们要守在这里坚持干到底。工地指挥部负责人根据这些积极建议和上级党委要求提高工效的精神，提出“过春节不离工地”的号召。
    这一号召提出后，立即获得了民工中的共产党员、共青团员、贫农、下中农和大多数民工的热烈支持，共产党员李增说：“我们来修水利就是为了早点把水库修好，为了完成全县的大利益，过年的小利益完全可以放弃。”贫农李兴义说：“以前我向地主借了过年米，三十晚上都还在帮他放田水，现在是干自己的，不过几个年都乐意。”
