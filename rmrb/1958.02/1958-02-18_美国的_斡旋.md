America's "Mediation"

Tunisia and France have both accepted America's "mediation" to resolve the French bombing of Tunisia. Why is it that the United States, which is usually keen to create tension, is now so enthusiastic about "mediating" the Franco-Tunisian dispute?

Regarding this question, an Associated Press correspondent, boasting of his decades of experience abroad, made the following estimate: The bombing of Tunisia "has greatly damaged French influence in North Africa, and to make up for this loss, some Western influence must be added. The United States is the only Western country with the money and prestige to do so," and "that's how the United States entered Indochina when France was wrestling there."

After reading this reporter's estimate, it is not difficult to understand the consequences of America's "mediation." For the Tunisian people, it will be a case of driving away the wolf through the front door, only to let the tiger in through the back.

### 美国的“斡旋”

    美国的“斡旋”
    突尼斯和法国，先后接受美国的“斡旋”，来解决法国轰炸突尼斯的事件。为什么一向惯于制造紧张局势的美国，这次在突法争端上却热衷于“斡旋”呢？
    对于这个问题，一个美联社自吹为老资格的驻外记者，根据他十多年的经验，作了下面的估计。他说：轰炸突尼斯事件“已使法国在北非的影响遭到很大损失，如果要弥补这个损失的话，就必须补充进去一些西方影响。美国是拥有金钱和威望来这样作的唯一西方国家”，而“当法国在印度支那摔跤的时候，美国就是这样进入那里的。”
    看了这个记者的估计，不难明白美国的“斡旋”将带来的结果，对于突尼斯人民来说，将是前门拒狼，后门进虎。
