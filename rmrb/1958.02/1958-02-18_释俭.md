    On Thrift
    Yi Mao

    What is thrift? Thrift is the rational and economical use of accumulated funds, using every penny where it is most urgently needed, and accomplishing as much as possible with as little money as possible. Spending on what should not be spent is extravagance. Not spending on what should be spent is stinginess.

    We oppose extravagance, and we also oppose stinginess. Our slogan is building the nation through diligence and thrift. This is a long-term construction policy. Just as Chairman Mao instructed: even "decades later, it will still be necessary to implement the principle of diligence and thrift, but it is particularly necessary to advocate diligence and thrift, and to pay special attention to conservation, in the current decades, in the current several five-year plan periods."

    The boundary between thrift and extravagance, thrift and stinginess, lies not in the size or amount of money spent, but in whether the spending is rational.

    The standard of whether something is "rational" here is concrete and changes according to time, place, and conditions. In a class society, this "rationality," like other "rationalities," is stamped with the mark of class.

    For example, in the old society, landlords and capitalists, in order to satisfy their selfish desires, did not consider it unreasonable to spend money like water. On the contrary, emphasizing extravagance and ostentation were their "virtues." But for workers and peasants, they were meticulous and stingy to the point of being completely ungenerous. Extravagance and stinginess, though seemingly two extremes, often found a dialectical unity in the bodies of egoists.

    As for the working class, it is a class that is naturally endowed with the virtue of diligence and thrift. Precisely because of their diligence, they deeply understand the difficulty of earning every thread and strand, and therefore they are able to be thrifty. But it is also the most selfless, most farsighted, and most collectivist class. For the sake of the nation, for the sake of the people, for the cause of the liberation of all mankind, they generously donate money, are eager to help others in need, and even sacrifice their lives without hesitation.

    Different classes, different standpoints, and different viewpoints make it difficult to have a common language. The "rationality" mentioned here is just one example.

    At the same time, our so-called rational standard is also related to the current national economic level. What is in line with the current national economic level is called thrift; what exceeds the current national economic level is called waste. However, the national economic level is constantly improving with the development of production. Today's hard struggle is for a better life tomorrow. "Fight hard for three years, live ten years longer." The happy future inspires the revolutionary zeal of 600 million people. But in any case, we must not forget that our country is still a poor, blank, and large country. The cadres of the Party and the state are entrusted by the People to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. To this end, we must conscientiously implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. We must always remember the proverb, "Every penny of the public's money is the sweat of the people," and strive to economize on expenses and cherish financial and material resources.

    However, thrift cannot be unilaterally understood as simply spending less money or not spending money. We cannot "manage the household" for the people in the manner of a "miser," but we must "build the household" for the people in a "high-yield" manner. We oppose waste, and not spending where we should not spend is precisely for the sake of spending more where it is most urgently needed. Without some key construction projects that can fundamentally change the face of our country, it would be impossible to catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of steel and other important product output in fifteen years or a little longer. To catch up with it and surpass it at the fastest speed, being good at accumulating funds and being good at using funds are equally important. That is to say, we must be diligent and thrifty, accumulating money penny by penny with the hands of 600 million people, and we must also be meticulous in our calculations, spending money most economically on the most urgently needed construction projects.

    "You are fond of big things and eager for quick success!" "You are eager for quick results and immediate benefits!" This is some people's criticism of the scale of our construction. We say: You are right! Don't we "like big things and love great achievements," or do we "like small things and love small transgressions?" What we "like" is the realistic "big," what we are "eager" for is the "achievements" of the people, and what is "near" is the "interests" of the people. Only communists have such grand ambitions, and only communists can point out such a clear goal of struggle for the people. With a clear goal of struggle, the masses of the people can arouse unparalleled enthusiasm and build up revolutionary enthusiasm.

    Based on such a utilitarian point of view, our Party has put forward the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, pointing out that extravagance and waste are one of the most dangerous things in socialist construction.

    The reason why it is one of the most dangerous things in socialist construction is because there is not only a dispute between two methods here, but also a dispute between two styles and two paths. Anyone with bourgeois ideology and a young master style will definitely adopt the extravagant and wasteful approach of a young master; anyone with individualistic and departmentalist ideas and styles will definitely not start from the perspective of 600 million people, which can be roughly asserted. However, it cannot be inferred from this that everyone who has wasteful behavior has bourgeois ideological style problems, because knowledge and experience problems also cause waste.

    For example, some things may seem thrifty, but may actually cause great waste; some things may seem wasteful, but are actually thrifty, or even the greatest thrift. Some exploratory undertakings in scientific research have this characteristic. This is certainly not to say that we do not need to implement the policy of diligence and thrift in scientific research, but rather that some things that are not easy to distinguish for a while need to be carefully studied and cannot be decided rashly.

    Speaking out freely, airing views fully, and holding great debates are not only good ways to expose waste phenomena, criticize wasteful ideas, and overcome the young master style, but also good ways to help leaders distinguish between things that are difficult to distinguish between extravagance and thrift and between thrift and stinginess.

    What is thrift? The principle of thrift has been described above. The same is true for building the country and managing the household, but managing the household is much simpler than building the country. Being in line with one's own economic strength, having planned expenditures, and making savings is thrift; exceeding one's own economic strength, having no plan, spending money indiscriminately on what should not be spent, and not having enough money to spend every month, and having to borrow money to live on is waste. Unilaterally emphasizing frugality and thrift is inappropriate. The goal of socialist struggle is to improve the people's living standards. We do not advocate that people live the life of "ascetics."

    We oppose waste and do not approve of stinginess. Waste and stinginess are both extremes and are the opposite of thrift. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out: "Opposing waste is only to oppose those expenditures that exceed the current national economic level or that should be saved but have not been saved, and it is by no means to shelve some things that should be done and can be done. Opposing waste is only to oppose those raw material reserves and consumption that exceed the needs of normal production and construction, and it is by no means to oppose even necessary raw materials or disregard product quality."

    释俭
    易茅
    什么叫做俭？俭就是合理地节省地使用积累起来的资金，把每一文钱都用到最迫切需要的地方去，用尽可能少的钱，办尽可能多的事。不当用的用了叫做奢。当用的不用叫做啬。
    我们反对奢，也反对啬。我们的口号是勤俭建国。这是一个长期的建设方针。正像毛主席指示的：就是“几十年以后也需要执行勤俭的原则，但是特别要提倡勤俭，特别要注意节约的，是在目前这几十年内，是在目前这几个五年计划的时期内。”
    俭与奢、俭与啬的界限不在于用钱数目的大小、多少，而在于用得是否合理。
    这里所说的合不合“理”的标准，是具体的，是依时间、地点、条件为转移的。在阶级社会里，这个“理”也和其他的“理”一样被打上了阶级的烙印。
    譬如说，在旧社会里，地主资本家为着满足他们的私欲，即使挥金如土，也不认为不合理。相反地，讲阔气、讲排场，正是他们的“美德”。但是对于工人农民，他们却斤斤计较，悭吝到一毛不拔的地步。奢与吝，看来像两个极端，但往往在利己主义者的身上得到对立的统一。
    至于工人阶级，却是天生具有勤俭美德的阶级。唯其勤，深知一丝一缕来处的不易，故能俭。但它又是最大公无私、最有远见、最有集体主义精神的阶级。为着国家、为着人民、为着全人类解放的事业，慷慨解囊，急公好义，以至于贡献出生命，都在所不惜。
    阶级不同，立场观点不同，就难得有共同语言。这里所说的“理”，只是其中的一例。
    同时，我们所谓合理的标准，也是与当前国家经济水平相联系的。合乎当前国家经济水平的，叫做节约，超过当前国家经济水平的，叫做浪费。但是，国家经济水平随着生产的发展不断提高。今天的艰苦奋斗就是为着明天能过更好的日子。“苦战三年，多活十年”，幸福的未来，鼓舞着六亿人民的革命干劲。但是无论如何不应忘记我国现在还是个又穷又白又大的国家。党和国家的干部受着人民的委托，要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。为此，必须兢兢业业地执行勤俭建国的方针。必须时时刻刻记住“公家一文钱，百姓一身汗”的谚语，极力撙节开支，爱惜财力物力。
    但是，不能把节约片面理解为只是少用钱或不用钱。我们不能用“守财奴”的办法为人民“持家”，而要用“一本万利”的办法为人民“发家”。我们反对浪费，在不应花的方面不花，正是为着能在最迫切需要的地方多花。没有一些能够根本改变我们国家面貌的重点建设，要想在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，那是不可能的。要以最快的速度赶上它，超过它，善于积累资金和善于使用资金具有同等重要的意义。就是说，既要克勤克俭，靠六亿人民的手把钱一文一文地积累起来，又要精打细算，把钱最节约地花在最迫切需要的建设项目上。
    “你们好大喜功！”“你们急功近利！”这是某些人对我们的建设规模的评头论足。我们说：你们说对了！难道我们不“好大喜功”，还“好小喜过”？我们“好”的是实事求是的“大”，“急”的是人民的“功”，“近”的是人民的“利”。只有共产党人，才有这样宏大的气魄，只有共产党人，才能为人民指出这样明确的奋斗目标。有了明确的奋斗目标，人民群众才能激起无比的热情，鼓起革命的干劲。
    基于这样的功利观点，我们的党提出勤俭建国的方针，指出铺张浪费，是社会主义建设中最危险的事情之一。
    其所以是社会主义建设中最危险的事情，因为这里不仅有着两种方法之争。还有着两种作风、两条道路之争。凡是有着资产阶级思想、大少爷作风的人，一定采取铺张浪费的大少爷作法；凡是有着个人主义、本位主义思想作风的人，一定不会从六亿人口出发，这大体是可以断言的。但是，不能从这里推论出：凡是有浪费行为的都有资产阶级思想作风问题。因为造成浪费的还有知识和经验问题。
    譬如说，有些事情貌似节约，其实可能造成很大浪费；有些事情貌似浪费，其实是节约，甚或是最大节约。科学研究中某些探索性的事业，就带有这样性质。这当然不是说，在科学研究上我们不需要贯彻勤俭方针，而是说，对待某些一时不易分辨的事情需要加以认真研究，不能草率决定。
    大鸣大放，大争大辩，不但是揭发浪费现象、批判浪费思想、克服大少爷作风的好办法，而且也是帮助领导上辨明某些难于划分奢、俭界限和俭、啬界限的好办法。
    什么是俭？俭的道理已如上述。建国如此，持家也是如此，只是持家比建国简单得多就是了。合乎自己的经济力量，有计划的开支，并作到有节余的就是节俭；超过自己的经济力量，毫无计划，不当花的乱花，每月花不够，还要借钱过日子的就是浪费。片面的强调节、俭是不适当的。社会主义的奋斗目标，就是为了提高人民生活水平。我们并不提倡人们过“苦行僧”的生活。
    我们反对浪费，也不赞成吝啬。浪费和吝啬都是极端，都是俭的反面。正如人民日报社论所指出的：“反对浪费，只是反掉那些超过目前国家经济水平的或者该节约而没有节约的开支，而绝不是把一些目前应该办而且可以办的事情搁着不办。反对浪费，只是反掉那些超过正常的生产建设所需要的原材料储备和消耗，而绝不是连必要的原材料也反掉，连产品质量也不顾。”
  （“我们行动的口号——反对浪费，勤俭建国！”）
