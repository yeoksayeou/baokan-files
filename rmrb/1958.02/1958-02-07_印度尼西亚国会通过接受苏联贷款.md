　　印度尼西亚国会通过接受苏联贷款
    新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚国会昨天晚上以九十五票对十八票通过了关于接受苏联一亿美元贷款的法案。
    国会也通过了一项由印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会提出的修改案，这项修改案要求把一部分苏联贷款用来供应消费品和交通工具。
    当这项法案交付表决的时候，印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党、伊斯兰教师联合会、印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党、白尔蒂伊斯兰党和一些其他的党派都赞成这项法案。马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党表示反对。印度尼西亚社会党议员在讨论这项法案的时候曾经退出会场。天主教党和印度尼西亚基督教党的议员在投票时弃权。
    苏联贷款一亿美元的协定是在1956年苏加诺总统访问苏联的时候签订的。政府在向国会报告时指出，苏联的贷款的利率是低的，偿还期限是长的，贷款对印度尼西亚建设是有利的。政府在它的报告中还指出，接受苏联贷款也是执行独立的和积极的外交政策的表现。
