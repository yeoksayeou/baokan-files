Xinhua News Agency, London, February 27th: The British House of Commons began a two-day debate on "Defense" policy on the 26th. The Conservative government's nuclear arms race policy and the signing of an agreement to establish US intermediate-range missile bases in Britain were fiercely attacked by opposition party members.

The Minister of Defense, Sandys, spoke first at the beginning of the debate, defending the government's policy. On the one hand, he expressed his hope to see "broad and thorough disarmament," but on the other hand, he reiterated that the West would use nuclear weapons in the event of war, even if the Soviet Union only used conventional armaments. He said that this is the "unwavering strategy" of the North Atlantic Group. He asked the British people to eliminate "doubts" about this strategy. Prime Minister Macmillan also defended the "nuclear deterrence" policy.

Labour Party member Victor Yates spoke, condemning the Conservative government's policy. He pointed out that the government had "clearly shown that it is more concerned with preparing for war than with negotiation." Yates also criticized the government for agreeing to the United States setting up missile bases in Britain. He said: "The agreement on ballistic missiles is spreading death in our country. It makes us the first target (in war). It invites others to attack this country. It invites others to destroy us." Another Labour Party member, Tom Steele, also condemned the government's policy as a "push-button suicide" policy.

The Labour Party's defense spokesman, George Brown, presented an impeachment motion on behalf of the Labour Party. He said that he was not opposed to hydrogen bombs and missile bases, but he was opposed to the timing of possessing these things. He asked, if there is a desire for the summit to succeed, then why choose this time to set up rockets? He pointed out that such measures poison the international atmosphere and increase doubts.

Brown also condemned the nuclear arms race policy. He said: "The louder you shout that we will retaliate with weapons of mass suicide under any circumstances—which is actually destroying London—the more people will believe that you will suffer a real and complete disaster."

The Liberal Party also put forward an impeachment motion, condemning the government for not taking action to stop the worldwide nuclear arms race.

    英政府追随美国核竞赛政策
    反对党议员鸣鼓而攻
    据新华社伦敦27日电　英国下院在26日开始举行为期两天的“国防”政策辩论。保守党政府的核军备竞赛政策以及在英国设置美国中程导弹基地协定的签订，受到了反对党议员的猛烈攻击。
    国防大臣桑迪斯在辩论开始时首先发言，为政府的政策辩护。他一方面表示希望看到“广泛的、彻底的裁军”，另一方面又重申，一旦发生战争西方就要使用核武器，即使苏联只使用常规军备。他说，这是北大西洋集团的“确定不移的战略”。他要求英国人消除对这种战略的“怀疑”。首相麦克米伦也为“核威慑”政策辩护。
    工党议员维克托·耶茨发言，谴责保守党政府这种政策。他指出，政府已经“清楚表明，它对于准备战争比对于协商更加关心”。耶茨还抨击政府同意美国在英国设置导弹基地。他说：“关于弹道导弹的协定在我国散布死亡。它使我们成为（战争中的）第一个目标。它邀请别人来攻击这个国家。它邀请别人来毁灭我们。”另一个工党议员汤姆·斯蒂尔也谴责政府的政策是“按电纽自杀”政策。
    工党国防问题发言人乔治·布朗代表工党提出了弹劾案，他表示他并不反对氢弹和导弹基地，他反对的是拥有这些东西的时机。他问道，如果渴望最高级会议成功，那又为什么要选择这个时候来设置火箭？他指出，这样的措施毒化了国际气氛，并且使疑虑增加。
    布朗还谴责核军备竞赛政策。他说：“愈高声叫嚷说我们在任何情况之下都将以大规模自杀武器来进行报复——这实际上就是毁灭伦敦——人们就愈会相信你将遭到一场真正的彻底的灾难。”
    自由党也提出了弹劾案，谴责政府不采取行动来制止世界范围的核军备竞赛。
