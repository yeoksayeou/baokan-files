Comparing Indicators, Learning from the Advanced
　　——Shanxi Daily Editorial
In the discussion of the national plan, the broad masses of workers have launched a wave worthy of great promotion. This is the comparison of advanced enterprises and high spirits between workers in some enterprises and similar enterprises inside and outside the province. After discovering the advanced indicators of fraternal enterprises, they bravely admitted their backwardness and proposed to catch up with and surpass the advanced indicators in a relatively short period and achieve a great leap forward in production. On the basis of rectification, factories that have done this are full of energy, and new upsurges have quickly appeared in production, and new records continue to emerge. In the past, although some factories and mines had compared some technical and economic indicators with fraternal factories, and learned from the advanced, it had not formed a mass movement like today. Whether comparing with and learning from the advanced can become a mass movement depends on whether enterprise leaders dare to admit their backwardness, conservatism, and complacency in front of the broad masses of workers, and dare to propose the goal of catching up with advanced factories in a short period. The fact that this was not done in the past, or was not done with great effort, and is now being done, shows the effect of rectification and that some enterprise leaders have begun to put down the burden of subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy. Therefore, the effect of rectification is quickly reflected in production. If this practice is rapidly popularized and adhered to regularly, it will bring fruitful results to industrial production.

In his congratulatory speech to the National Conference of Advanced Producers in 1956, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "The history of human society, in the final analysis, is the history of production, the history of producers. Production is always in a state of development and change, and new production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies. Therefore, in any era, in any production sector, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who adopt relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their technology and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the whole society, and social production is improved." This speech by Comrade Liu Shaoqi clarified how production develops and explained that learning from the advanced and constantly striving to catch up with the advanced production level is an important method of leading production. That is to say, only by recognizing the inevitability of production development can people give full play to their subjective initiative and promote the development of production. Therefore, constantly looking at the advanced and striving to catch up with the advanced is an important method of understanding the laws of production development and improving production. Without this, those who lead production will make subjective mistakes. Without this, they will stick to the old ways and fall behind objective things. Now, some factories are using the method of comparing indicators and learning from the advanced, which is an important method of realizing another leap forward in production.

Now everyone says that they want to leap forward again, which requires the courage and courage of communists to lead enterprises. The great call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years fully embodies the heroic spirit of the Chinese people and demonstrates that the Chinese people have the courage to win every battle. In order to achieve this goal, the workers of each enterprise must catch up with and surpass the advanced indicators of advanced enterprises in a relatively short period. In the process of catching up with Britain, an important step is to compare the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced among our socialist enterprises. This kind of competition will bring a common upsurge to the production of our various enterprises, enabling us to work together in the same boat, ride the wind and waves, and move straight towards the level of industrial production that the old-fashioned capitalist Britain has achieved and has not achieved in a hundred years.

When comparing indicators and learning from advanced enterprises, we should not only see the advanced indicators of others, but more importantly, we should learn from the advanced experience of others in creating advanced indicators. Some enterprise leaders, because of their great pride and short-sightedness, dare not face up to their own backwardness and do not have the courage to admit that others are advanced, and therefore cannot take the experience of the advanced and turn it into a weapon to promote the advancement of their own enterprises. For example, in two machine factories in a city, some cadres are mutually unconvinced; in several coal mines under the leadership of a mining bureau, some leaders look down on the advanced experience of others; and the leading cadres of several workshops in a large factory have not learned from the advanced experience in the leadership work of other workshops for a long time. The fact is very obvious that enterprises that have created advanced indicators have advanced technology and advanced experience, and learning their advanced technology and advanced experience is a shortcut to improving the technical and economic indicators of their own enterprises. The social responsibility of each of us is to inherit the experience of our predecessors and learn from the experience of others, and to develop the experience of our predecessors and others in order to promote the development of social production. Learning from the experience of fraternal enterprises and developing the experience of others can create higher technical and economic indicators.

In the process of comparing indicators and learning from the advanced, enterprise leaders must also have the ambition that if others can do it, they can do it too. Or, this is also a sign of whether a person has revolutionary drive. In comparing indicators, there are often two different attitudes. One kind of person believes that what others can do, they can definitely do quickly, and under the inspiration of others' experience, they will definitely do better than others and create higher indicators. Another kind of person believes that what others can do, they cannot do, because their equipment conditions are poor, their technical level is low, and their management experience is lacking, etc. Of course, things that are objectively impossible should not be tried. But if difficulties that can be overcome objectively are not actively creating conditions to overcome, and the subjective initiative of people is not recognized, and one sighs in the face of difficulties and becomes a prisoner of difficulties, then it is not the attitude of a promoter, but of a retarder. Every enterprise leader should be the former, be a promoter, and in the face of difficulties, give play to the subjective initiative of people, give play to the power of the masses, actively create conditions, overcome all difficulties, and achieve the advanced indicators of fraternal enterprises.

Comparing the advanced and comparing drive is not just a matter for enterprise leaders. Only by taking the results of this comparison to the masses, organizing mass discussions, proposing clear goals, and arousing the revolutionary drive of the masses can a huge force be generated. While carrying out indicator comparisons between enterprises, we should also widely carry out the movement of comparing the advanced and comparing drive among the masses. Only when factories find objects, workers seek opponents, and comparisons are widely carried out and competitions are organized, can production always be in a state of upsurge and can it continue to leap forward.

　　比指标  学先进
　　——山西日报社论
    广大职工在讨论国家计划中，掀起了一股值得大大提倡的热潮，这就是一些企业的职工和省内外同类型企业比先进、比干劲。发现了兄弟企业的先进指标以后，勇敢地承认自己落后，并且提出要在较短的时期内赶上和超过先进指标，实现生产大跃进。在整风的基础上，凡是这样作了的工厂，职工都是干劲十足，生产上迅速出现新的高潮，新纪录不断出现。在过去，虽然也曾有一些厂矿和兄弟厂比某些技术经济指标，比过先进，但还没有像今天这样，形成群众性的运动。企业领导者当着广大职工的面，敢于承认自己落后、保守、自满，敢于提出在短时期内赶上先进厂的奋斗目标，这是比先进、学先进能否成为群众运动的关键。过去没有这样做，或是做的劲头不大，现在这样做了，正说明了整风的效果，说明了一些企业领导者开始放下了主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义的包袱。因而使整风的效果很快地反映到生产上来。现在这种做法如果迅速普遍化，并且经常地坚持下去，它将给工业生产带来丰硕的果实。
    刘少奇同志在1956年对全国先进生产者代表会议的祝词中指出：“人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代、在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。”刘少奇同志这段讲话，阐明了生产是怎样发展的，说明了向先进者学习，经常努力赶上先进生产水平，是领导生产的重要方法。这就是说，人们只有认识了生产发展的必然性，才能高度地发挥主观能动作用，推动生产的发展。因此，眼睛经常看看先进者，努力追赶先进者，是认识生产发展规律和提高生产的重要方法。不如此，领导生产的人就要犯主观主义的错误。不如此，就会故步自封，落在客观事物的后面。现在，一些工厂采用比指标、学先进的方法，就是实现生产再跃进的一个重要方法。
    现在大家都说要跃进再跃进，这就需要有共产党人领导企业的魄力和勇气。党中央提出的在十五年后赶上或者超过英国钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量的伟大号召，就充分体现了我国人民的英雄气概，表现了我国人民有着战无不胜的魄力。为了达到这个目标，每个企业的职工就必须在较短的时间内赶上和超过先进企业的先进指标。我国在赶上英国的进程中，重要步骤就是在我国社会主义企业之间比先进、学先进、赶先进。这种比赛，将给我们各个企业的生产带来共同的高涨，使我们同舟共济，乘风破浪，直向老牌资本主义英国在一百年内所达到的和没达到的工业生产水平前进。
    和兄弟企业比指标、比先进时，不仅要看到别人的先进指标，而且更重要的是要学习别人创造出先进指标的先进经验。有些企业领导者因为骄气大、眼光短，不敢正视自己的落后，没有勇气承认别人先进，因而不能把先进者的经验拿过来，变成推进本企业生产前进的武器。例如，一个市的两个机器厂，有些干部就是互相不服气；一个矿务局领导下的几座煤矿，有些领导者看不起别人的先进经验；一个大工厂的几个车间的领导干部，长期不学习别的车间的领导工作中的先进经验。事实是非常明显的，凡是创造出先进指标的企业，就有先进的技术和先进的经验，学习他们的先进技术和先进经验，就是提高本企业技术经济指标的捷径。我们每个人的社会责任，就是继承前人和学习别人的经验，并发展前人和别人的经验，以促进社会生产的发展。学习兄弟企业的经验并发展别人的经验，就能创造出更高的技术经济指标。
    在比指标、比先进的过程中，企业领导者也还要有别人能作到、自己就能作到的豪情壮志。或者说，这也是考验一个人是否有革命干劲的标志。在比指标的时候，往往有两种不同的态度。一种人认为，别人能办到的事自己一定能很快办到，并且在别人经验的启发下，一定会比别人干得更好，创造更高的指标。另一种人认为，别人能办到的自己却办不到，理由是自己设备条件差，技术水平低，管理经验少等等。当然，客观上实在办不到的事，就不应该去碰钉子。但是客观上能够战胜的困难，却不努力创造条件，去战胜困难，不承认人的主观能动作用，在困难面前唉声叹气，当困难的俘虏，那就不是一个促进派的态度，而是促退派了。每个企业领导者都应该是前一种人，做促进派，要在困难面前，发挥人的主观能动作用，发挥群众的力量，积极创造条件，战胜一切困难，达到兄弟企业的先进指标。
    比先进、比干劲，并不只是企业领导者的事，只有把这种对比的结果，拿到群众中去，组织群众讨论，提出明确的目标，鼓起群众的革命干劲，才能产生巨大的力量。在企业之间进行指标对比的同时，在群众之间也应广泛开展比先进、比干劲的运动，只有工厂找对象，工人觅对手，普遍地开展对比，组织竞赛，生产才能经常处于高涨状态，才能不断地跃进。
