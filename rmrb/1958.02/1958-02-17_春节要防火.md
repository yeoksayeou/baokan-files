Fire Prevention During the Spring Festival
    Xiao Fang
    People all love to celebrate the Spring Festival joyfully. Some families are busy stewing meat, stir-frying dishes, and deep-frying food before the festival. Children also want to buy lanterns and firecrackers. It's truly a joyous occasion for everyone, but these festive activities also create opportunities for fires to occur. Looking back at previous years, fires during the Spring Festival are more frequent than usual. In Beijing, around the Spring Festival last year, there were 82 fire accidents in a little over a month, causing great losses, according to incomplete statistics.
    The reason for the increased number of fires during the Spring Festival is that people forget about fire prevention while enjoying the festivities. For example, some people, when deep-frying food, have too high a flame, fill the oil pot too full, and carelessly spill oil out of the pot when putting things in, causing the oil to catch fire. Others leave a pot of meat on the stove and go out to play, causing the pot to boil dry and the meat to burn and catch fire. Some people dry clothes on the stove without watching them and go visiting friends, causing the clothes to burn after a long time. Some people carelessly throw cigarette butts, and unextinguished cigarette butts can easily ignite flammable materials. Also, children playing with firecrackers indoors, or lighting lanterns, setting off firecrackers, and lighting incense and candles near flammable materials like firewood, can all ignite flammable materials and cause fires. Some people are busy going to the streets to play and forget to turn off the radio when they leave home, causing the radio to burn down after a long time. Some fires are caused by farmers in the suburbs who light firewood in the warm kang (heated brick bed) and go out to play, causing the fire to spurt out of the stove opening or the kang to become too hot, causing cracks in the kang surface and igniting bedding. All these causes of fire are due to people forgetting about fire prevention while enjoying themselves, not only spoiling the Spring Festival but also burning down their houses and furniture. In order to celebrate the Spring Festival well and protect the safety of people's lives and property, it is hoped that everyone will pay attention to fire prevention while enjoying the Spring Festival.

    春节要防火
    萧放
    人们都爱欢欢喜喜的过春节。有些人家在节前，忙着炖肉、炒菜、炸油食物。孩子们也要买花灯笼，买鞭炮。真是皆大欢喜，但是这些过节的活动也给火灾的发生带来了机会，从往年看，春节期间发生的火灾就比平常多。北京市去年春节前后，一个多月的时间中，不完全统计就有八十二家发生了火灾事故，损失很大。
    春节期间发生火灾多是由于人们欢乐过节忘了防火。如有的人炸油食物时，火太旺，油锅添油太满，往油锅内放东西时不小心，使油溢出锅外，被炉火引着油起火，还有的人把肉锅坐在炉子上，外出玩去了，把锅熬干，把肉烧着起火。有的人把衣物烤在炉子上不看着、就串门去了，时间长了把衣物烤着，有的人吸烟时把烟头乱扔，没灭的烟头引着容易着的东西。还有孩子们在屋内放花炮，在靠近柴禾等堆存易燃物的附近，点灯笼、放花炮、点香火和蜡烛，都能引着容易着的东西起火。还有的人忙着上街游玩，出门时忘了关收音机，时间长了把收音机烧毁。还有些火灾是郊区农民把暖炕内的柴禾点着就出去玩去了，火从灶门里喷出来或把炕烧的太热，炕面裂缝滋出火来引着被褥起火。以上这些火灾原因都是人们在欢乐中忘了防火而引起来的，不但春节没过好，还把住的房子和家具全烧了。为了过好春节及保护人民生命财产的安全，希望大家在欢度春节中注意防火。
