    On the Jingguang Road
    By Fan Rongkang, Our Correspondent
    The New Jingguang Railway

    These days, I have been traveling south along the Jingguang Railway. The train speeds across the Hebei Plain, the scenery of the fields on both sides too quickly seen to fully appreciate. Inside the carriage, the heating is on, the radio broadcasts pleasant songs, the train attendants hand out comic books to the passengers, and tea is served again and again. The journey is comfortable in every way.

    I have been dealing with railways for several years. Since the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began with the first shovel of earth in the mountain city of Chongqing, I have not interrupted my reporting on railway matters. However, in these years, the focus has been mainly on reporting the construction of new lines. People also have this habit: when talking about the development of the railway industry, they first look at how many new railways have been built. This is of course undeniable. In fact, the development of the railway industry is more than just the construction of new lines! The technical transformation and maintenance projects of existing railways are also enormous in scale and extremely rich in content. Take the Jingguang Railway we are traveling on now! People only know that it was renamed after the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the connection of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Yuehan Railway; they only know that the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Yuehan Railway are two ancient railway trunk lines in China. Who would have thought about the various encounters these two railways have experienced in the past half-century? Who would have thought how dilapidated these two railways, "born with deficiencies and acquired maladjustments," and repeatedly ravaged, had become? Who can fully count the efforts and sleepless nights of hard thinking that railway employees have put in over the years since liberation to restore the youth of these two railways and improve their transportation capacity?

    The country's railways are managed by regional railway administrations. The Jingguang Railway, which runs through the north and south of the country, is now managed by the Beijing, Zhengzhou, and Guangzhou Railway Administrations. It is difficult to collect data on the entire Jingguang Railway at once. But judging from the few snippets of material that can be collected, the past and present appearance of the Jingguang Railway are fundamentally different. Instead of calling it an ancient railway, it is more accurate to call it a newly built railway. Because the rails, sleepers, ballast, stations, signaling equipment, water supply equipment... on this line are mostly new. The amount of technical transformation and line maintenance work probably exceeds the amount of work when the road was originally built.

    In the past, the Jingguang Railway had inconsistent technical standards. There were more than two hundred types of rails of different types and lengths, most of which were light rails of 37 kg or less. Some roadbeds were only one cun thick, with an average of only 1,400 sleepers per kilometer. As a result, the entire line had a very slow running speed, and the train's traction tonnage (the weight a train can pull on a line) was very low. Before liberation, trains on the Jingguang line could only travel 15 to 30 kilometers per hour, and the traction tonnage of freight trains was only about 700 to 800 tons; even in the "golden age," it was only about 1,200 tons. Some people say that it took one or two months to transport something from Beijing to Hankou at that time, after several rounds of tossing.

    This is certainly not the fault of the Jingguang Railway itself. People familiar with the railway situation say that it was never as convenient to build railways in the past as it is now. Not to mention anything else, the funding problem alone could kill people. The book "History of Chinese Railways," published by Zhonghua Book Company in 1929, gave a detailed introduction to the construction process of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. From the time Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty approved the construction of the road in the fifteenth year of Guangxu, it took seven or eight years to raise funds. First, government funds were allocated, but they couldn't be paid out. Later, shares were solicited from various places, but "no one responded." Then, Sheng Xuanhuai's "method of using government funds, commercial shares, and foreign debts" was used, but as a result, "commercial shares were worthless, and government funds were unreliable." Finally, in April of the twenty-third year of Guangxu, a loan contract was signed with the Belgian Bank and Factory Joint Stock Company in Wuchang, and the construction and management rights of this railway were all sold to foreigners. It is entirely conceivable that the standards of the line were low and the quality was poor. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the Jingguang Railway was even more severely damaged. By the time of national liberation, two-thirds of the bridges on the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway had been destroyed by the Kuomintang.

    In recent years, through continuous construction, the Jingguang Railway has not only regained its youth, but its transportation capacity has also far surpassed that of the past. Judging from the situation of the 800-kilometer line under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, which starts from Anyang in the north and extends to Puqi in the south, most of the rails have been replaced with heavy rails of 43 kg or more, the roadbed has mostly reached a thickness of 2.5 to 3 cun, and an average of 1,840 sleepers have been laid per kilometer. The station, water supply equipment, communication and signaling equipment, and locomotive and vehicle maintenance equipment have all been greatly strengthened. Zhengzhou Station had only eight tracks for a long time and was known as "Old Eight Tracks." Today, it has become an important hub station with more than 50 tracks, and a mechanized hump shunting yard is being built here at an accelerated pace. It is particularly worth mentioning that double-tracking projects have started on a large scale, and double-tracking projects in many areas have been completed and put into operation. As a result of these measures, both the running speed and the train's traction tonnage have been greatly improved. Within the territory of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration on the Jingguang Railway, the allowed speed has now been increased to 70 to 90 kilometers per hour, and the maximum train traction tonnage has reached 2,700 to 2,800 tons. It is said that north of Anyang, the technical transformation project of the Jingguang Railway within the territory of the Beijing Railway Administration is even larger in scale, faster in progress, and has better line conditions. South of Puqi, a lot of work has also been completed on the section managed by the Guangzhou Railway Administration, but the growth of transportation tasks in some sections is relatively slow, and there is no need to carry out more line modifications for the time being.

    The current Jingguang Railway is one of the busiest railway trunk lines in China. Dear friends! When you travel on the Jingguang Railway, please do not forget the road builders who are opening mountains and filling rivers and transforming the technical conditions of this railway, the road maintenance workers who maintain the quality of this railway day and night, and the track inspectors who inspect the line in the middle of the night, braving heavy snow and cold winds, carrying lonely lamps. Their labor cannot add a railway line symbol to our country's map, but their contributions are also part of the progress of our country's railway industry.

    Crossing the Yellow River

    I don't know what time it was at night when the train left the boundary of Hebei; when I woke up, it was already in Henan. At a little after seven o'clock, the train departed from Laotian'an Station, and the radio, which had been silent for a long time, suddenly broadcast the majestic singing of the "Yellow River Cantata." The female announcer reported in an infinitely profound and emotional voice: "Dear passengers! We are about to cross the Yellow River. The Yellow River, the second largest river in the motherland..."

    The carriage became lively, and people crowded toward the windows. I saw the rising sun, and chunks of purple-black clouds embraced a ball of fiery red sun rising from the east. The Yellow River water is shallow, and the riverbeds on both sides are exposed to the biting cold wind, with a stream of water in the middle carrying floating ice, seemingly moving, yet not moving. Ah! Yellow River, why are you silent? Could it be that you also know that the will of the people is irresistible, and the days when you roared and flooded will never return?

    The train was running smoothly on the Yellow River Bridge. This bridge also has a tortuous story. In the beginning, it was contracted by the Belgian Bank and Factory Joint Stock Company, costing 2.65 million taels of silver, but for a long time only small locomotives could pass, and the running speed per hour could not exceed 20 kilometers, and the insurance period was only 15 years. When the insurance period expired in 1920, a new bridge had to be built. The Ministry of Communications at that time hired engineers from nine countries, including Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and Japan, as "consultants" to solicit designs. As a result, the bidding documents from the Belgian Railway Company ranked first. It is said that things should have come to an end here. Who knew that the Chinese could not make their own decisions about Chinese affairs? The "consultants" from the United States and Japan insisted on objecting because their country's bidding documents were not selected. As a result, the construction of a new bridge became a suspended case that dragged on for more than 20 years. By the time of liberation, this old bridge was already useless. At that time, most engineers believed that it should be scrapped and a new bridge built. In 1950, Soviet experts came. They conducted an on-site survey and tested the load-bearing capacity of the bridge. They believed that it would be a pity to scrap it and suggested using the experience of repairing bridges during the Soviet Patriotic War to reinforce it. This suggestion of the Soviet experts was adopted. It only took two or three months and cost very little labor and materials to restore the dilapidated old bridge to its youth, and trains pulled by medium-sized locomotives could also pass on the bridge unimpeded. Later, after four reinforcements, the foundation was strengthened, and the steel beams were replaced. Large locomotives can also pass through the bridge at the fastest speed. People who know this story, when they come to the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge, praise the touching spirit of the Soviet experts for saving funds for the Chinese people.

    However, today, when people come to the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge, there are even more attractive topics. Looking east, not more than half a li away, cranes stretch their necks, and dedicated lines are laid towards the riverbank. There, a new Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is under construction. With the increasing volume of transportation on the Jingguang Railway, the old Yellow River Bridge, which only has a single track, is no longer capable. In particular, after the Sanmenxia Reservoir is completed in the future, the Yellow River downstream will become clear, and the scouring force will increase. The piers of the old Yellow River Bridge, which are only 17 meters down to the riverbed, will be difficult to withstand such a huge river scouring force. Therefore, building a new Yellow River Bridge is already very necessary.

    The new Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is 2,890 meters long in total, with 71 spans, each span being 40 meters long, making it the longest bridge in our country. The foundation construction will adopt the "large tubular pile drilling method," but the diameter of the tubular piles will be much larger than those used in the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Two tubular piles under each pier will be sufficient. The entire project can be completed in 1960. Bao Yongchang, chief engineer of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, said: "After the completion of this bridge, it will be as strong and sturdy as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and it will be able to withstand the passage of any locomotive."

    The project to build this bridge is being undertaken by the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, which has rich bridge-building experience. Currently, two engineering teams have been dispatched to the site, and construction machinery is being transferred in a steady stream. The first test pile will be started on February 5.

    Shorten Fifteen Hours

    I visited the Zhengzhou Railway Administration and changed to an international train to Pingxiang in Zhengzhou to continue my journey south.

    Sitting on the train, recalling what I saw and heard at the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, my mood was difficult to calm. According to the comrades of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, the Ministry of Railways is considering whether to shorten the running time of passenger trains on the Jingguang Railway by fifteen hours, of which the section under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration is required to shorten it by five hours. The entire bureau is currently studying this issue, and the chief engineer said that it is possible to shorten it by five hours within the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Bureau.

    Shortening the running time of passenger trains on the Jingguang Railway by fifteen hours, what a great leap forward this is, and how much convenience it will bring to thousands of passengers! Of course, this is also a difficult problem. However, as long as all the employees of the railway are mobilized, what difficulties cannot be overcome? People are the most active factor in production.

    The enthusiastic conversation of passengers sitting next to me woke me up from my contemplation. A man who looked to be twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old was excitedly telling others about his long journey from Guangxi to the north on the Xiang-Gui and Jingguang Railways, changing to the Longhai Railway to the west, and then to the Bao-Cheng Railway to the south, returning to his hometown in Sichuan, and then returning. This topic attracted me, and I joined in. It turned out that this passenger, who had traveled thousands of kilometers, was a road maintenance worker named Jian Guoqing from the Litang Public Works Section of the Liuzhou Railway Administration, a native of Mingshan, Sichuan. He used to be a farmer, and the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway attracted him to the construction team. Later, he went north, attacked the Bashan Mountains, fought the Qinling Mountains, and completed the Bao-Cheng Railway. Last year, he was transferred to the Liuzhou Railway Administration as a road maintenance worker. This time, he was going home to pick up his wife.

    However, his wife was not with him.

    I was a little surprised and asked him: "Didn't your wife come along with you?"

    He smiled and told me: Of course, his wife was very willing to go to Guangxi with him, but the township people's committee did not agree. The comrades of the township people's committee said to them that agricultural production is very important. If the family members of the workers are all taken out, the agricultural production population will become the consumption population of the city, which is not good for the country or for themselves. Therefore, his wife stayed in her hometown.

    I asked him again: "Then, do you understand the reasoning behind that?"

    "What's there not to understand? It's the country's policy, and the country sees further than we do. Besides, it's convenient to take the train home. Look! I've only been out for a few days, and I'm on my way back again. In the future, when the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway are opened, it will be even more convenient."

    Then, he talked a lot about the importance of road maintenance work, as if he was afraid that others would underestimate his profession. He said that road maintenance work is sometimes more tense than the construction work of new lines. If there is a problem with the line, it needs to be rushed to repair it, and it cannot be left unattended just because it is the end of working hours. If an accident occurs in the section of the line that he maintains, the road maintenance worker is responsible...

    He talked enthusiastically, making people feel that he loved his work so much. This kind of love for work reminded me of another acquaintance, Gu Maoxun, a senior engineer from the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau. This old man, who was already in his sixties, had longed to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge for a long time, and his wish finally came true when his hair had turned white. At that time, he was so happy and so satisfied that he felt that he had no other requirements in his life. On the day the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed, his lifetime of technical work could also come to an end. But later, when the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was nearing completion, he was reluctant to leave. He said to others: "I want to correct my past thoughts. I want to take the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge as the beginning of my personal involvement in China's bridge construction cause."

    Gu Maoxun and Jian Guoqing, some are well-known figures, and some are "unsung heroes," but they all love their work. How many thousands of such people are there on the railway? The development of China's railway industry depends on the efforts of these people. With such people who love their work, what is difficult about the feat of shortening the running time of passenger trains on the Jingguang Railway by fifteen hours, as well as the leap forward in all aspects of railway work?

    The night is deep. The car lights are dim, and the passengers are falling asleep one after another. Jian Guoqing was also tired. He leaned back in his chair, casually pulled the curtain over his face, and fell asleep, snoring loudly; sleeping so soundly, so sweetly, as if he were in his own home.

专栏：在高潮中南行⑥

    京广路上
    本报记者　范荣康
    新的京广铁路
    这些天来，一直沿着京广铁路南行。列车在河北平原上奔驰，两旁的田野景色不及尽睹。车厢内暖气开放，广播器传出悦耳的歌声，列车员把一本本连环画册递给旅客，茶水加了一趟又一趟。旅途生活处处使人感到舒服。
    我同铁路打交道已经好几年了。从成渝铁路的建设工程在山城重庆挖第一铲土开始，一直没有中断过关于铁路方面的报道。然而，这些年来，主要是报道新线的建设。人们也有这样的习惯：谈到铁路事业的发展，首先看新建了多少条铁路。这当然是无可非议的。其实，铁路事业的发展，岂止于新线建设！原有铁路的技术改造和维修工程，也是规模巨大、内容极其丰富的。就拿我们现在所行走的这条京广铁路来说吧！人们只知道它是武汉长江大桥建成、京汉铁路和粤汉铁路接轨后改名的，只知道京汉铁路和粤汉铁路是中国两条古老的铁路干线，谁会想到半个世纪来这两条铁路所经历的种种遭遇？谁会想到这两条“先天不足，后天失调”，又几经摧残因而未老先衰的铁路曾经破败到什么程度？谁又能尽数解放后的这些年来，铁路员工为了恢复这两条铁路的青春，提高这两条铁路的运输能力，付出了多少辛劳和多少个不眠之夜的苦思？
    全国的铁路是按地区分设管理局管理的。贯通祖国南北的京广铁路，现在公属北京、郑州、广州三个管理局管理。要收集整个京广铁路的资料，一时还有困难。但仅就能收集到的一些片段材料来看，京广铁路的今昔面貌也已根本不同了。说它是一条古老的铁路，倒不如说它是一条新建的铁路更确切些。因为这条线路上的钢轨、枕木、道碴、车站、信号设备、给水设备……许多都是新的。技术改造和线路维修的工程量，恐怕早已超过当初建路时的工程量。
    从前的京广铁路，技术标准不一。不同类型和不同长短的钢轨共有两百多种，其中大部分是三十七公斤以下的轻轨。道床有的只一公寸厚，平均每公里只有一千四百多根枕木。因而全线行车速度极慢，列车牵引定数（一列火车在一条线路上行驶时所能牵引的重量）很低。解放以前，京广线上，火车每小时只能行走十五公里到三十公里，货物列车的牵引定数只七、八百吨左右，“黄金时代”，也不过一千二百吨左右。有人说，那时候从北京往汉口运点东西，经过几番捣腾，要一、两个月的时间才能送到。
    这当然不是京广铁路本身的过错，熟悉铁路情况的人说，从前修铁路哪有现在这么方便。别的不说，经费问题就能把人难死。1929年中华书局出版的“中国铁道史”一书，对京汉铁路的建设过程有过详细的介绍。从前清光绪十五年，粤督张之洞奏准筑路开始，筹集资金就花了七、八年时间。先是拨用官款，拨不出来。后是各地招股，“无应募者”。再用盛宣怀“官款商股洋债并用办法”，结果“商股一文不名，官款毫无把握”。最后，到光绪二十三年四月，才同比利时银行工厂合股公司在武昌订下了借款合同，把这条铁路的建设权、管理权通统卖给了外国人。线路的标准低、质量差，那是完全可以想像的。在抗日战争和解放战争中，京广铁路更几经破坏。到全国解放时，仅京汉铁路全线桥梁，就有三分之二被国民党炸毁了。
    这些年来，经过不断的建设，京广铁路不但早已恢复了青春，运输能力也远胜当年。从郑州铁路管理局所辖北起安阳、南至蒲圻的八百多公里线路情况来看，钢轨大部分已换成四十三公斤以上的重轨，道床大都达到二公寸半至三公寸厚，平均每公里铺设的枕木已达一千八百四十根。车站、给水设备、通信信号设备和机车车辆的检修设备都大大地加强了。郑州车站长期以来只有八股道，人称“老八股”，今天它已成为一个拥有五十多条股道的重要枢纽站，机械化的驼峰调车场正在这里加紧建设。特别值得提出的是，复线工程已大量开始，许多地区的复线工程已经全部竣工，交付营业。由于这些措施的实现，行车速度和列车牵引定数都大大提高了。京广铁路郑州局境内，现在允许速度已提高到每小时七十公里至九十公里，列车牵引定数最高达到二千七、八百吨。据说安阳以北，北京铁路管理局境内京广铁路的技术改造工程，规模还要大，进度还要快，线路情况还要好。蒲圻以南，广州铁路管理局管的那一段，也完成了不少工程，只是有些区段的运输任务增长较慢，暂时还不需要对线路进行更多的改造。
    现在的京广铁路，是我国运输最繁忙的铁路干线之一。亲爱的朋友们！当你们坐上京广铁路的列车旅行时，请你们不要忘记那些开山填河、改造着这条铁路技术状况的筑路工人们，和那些日日夜夜维护着这条铁路质量的养路工们，还有那些深更半夜顶着大雪寒风、提着孤灯检查线路情况的巡道员们。他们的劳动不能在我国的地图上增添一条铁路线的符号，但我国铁路事业的前进，也有着他们的功劳。
    过黄河
    不知是夜里什么时候，列车驰出了河北境界；醒来时，早已是河南地方了。七点多钟，火车从老田庵车站开出，静默多时的广播器忽然送出雄伟的“黄河大合唱”的歌声。女广播员用无限深远的、感情充沛的声音报告：“亲爱的旅客们！前面就要过黄河了。黄河，祖国的第二条大河……”
    车厢里活跃起来，人们挤向窗口。只见旭日初上，一块块紫黑色的彩云拥着一团火红的太阳从东方升起。黄河水浅，两边的河床坦露在凛冽的寒风中，中间一脉流水驮着浮冰，似动非动。啊！黄河，你为什么沉默？莫非你也知道人民的意志不可抗拒，任你咆哮、任你泛滥的日子将一去不复返？
    火车在黄河大桥上平稳地行驶着。这座桥也有一段曲折的故事。当初，是由比利时银行工厂合股公司承包的，费银二百六十五万两，但长期以来只能通行小型机车，每小时的行车速度不能超过二十公里，并且保险期才十五年。1920年保险期满，只得另建新桥。当时的交通部聘请了英、美、法、比、日等九国的工程师为“顾问”，招标设计。结果，比国铁路公司的标单图件名列首位。按说，事情到这里也该有个眉目了。谁知中国的事情中国人做不了主，美、日两国“顾问”，为了本国的标单没有入选，坚持反对意见。结果，建设新桥的事情竟成为一拖二十几年的悬案。到解放时，这座老桥早已不中用了。当时，一般工程师都认为只有报废，另建新桥。1950年，来了苏联专家。他们实地勘察，对桥梁的载重能力作了试验，认为报废了可惜，建议用苏联卫国战争中修复桥梁的经验进行加固。采纳了苏联专家的这个建议，只用了两、三个月的时间，花了很少的工料，就使这座残破不堪的老桥恢复了青春，并且中型机车牵引的列车也可以在桥上通行无阻。后来又经过四次加固，强化了基础，更换了钢梁，大型机车也可以用最快的速度通过大桥。知道这段故事的人，来到郑州黄河大桥，无不称赞苏联专家为中国人民节省资金的感人的精神。
    不过，今天，人们来到郑州黄河桥，又有更吸引人的话题。向东望去，不过半里路的地方，起重机伸长着脖子，专用线铺向河岸。那里，新的郑州黄河大桥正在建设中。随着京广铁路运输量的日益增长，只有一股单线的黄河旧桥已力不胜任了。特别是将来三门峡水库建成后，黄河下游变清水，冲刷力加大，黄河旧桥的桥墩只下到河底十七公尺，难以经受如此巨大的河流冲刷力。因而另建黄河新桥已经是十分必要的了。
    新的郑州黄河大桥全长二千八百九十公尺，共七十一孔，每孔跨度四十公尺，是我国第一长桥。基础施工将采用“大型管柱钻孔法”，不过管柱直径要比武汉长江大桥所用的大得多。每个桥墩下两根管柱就行了。全部工程1960年可以完工。郑州铁路管理局总工程师鲍永昌说：“这座大桥建成后，同武汉长江大桥一样，坚固结实，不管机车怎么跑都行。”
    承建这座大桥工程的，是具有丰富建桥经验的武汉长江大桥工程局。现在，两支工程队已开赴现场，施工机械正源源调拨，第一根试椿将在2月5日开始。缩短十五小时
    我是访问了郑州铁路管理局，在郑州改乘去凭祥的国际列车继续南行的。
    坐在车上，回忆去郑州铁路管理局所见所闻，我的心境难以平静。据郑州铁路管理局的同志们谈，跃进声中，铁道部正考虑能否把京广铁路旅客列车的运行时间缩短十五小时，其中要求郑州铁路管理局所辖的一段缩短五小时。现在全局正在研究这个问题，总工程师表示，郑州局管内缩短五小时是可以做到的。
    京广铁路旅客列车的运行时间缩短十五小时，这是多么大的跃进，对千千万万的旅客将有多么大的便利呵！当然，这也是一个难题。但是，只要把全路职工发动起来，又有什么困难不能克服呢？人，是生产中最积极的因素。
    邻座旅客的热烈交谈，把我从沉思中惊醒。一位看来二十七、八岁的男子正兴高彩烈地向别人叙说他从广西搭湘桂路、京广路列车北上，换陇海路列车西行，转宝成路列车南下，回到四川老家，又折返回来的长途旅行见闻。这个话题把我吸引住了，我也参加了进去。原来这位行经数千公里的旅客，是柳州铁路管理局黎塘工务段的一名养路工，名叫蹇国清，四川名山人。从前是农民，成渝铁路的建设工程把他吸引到施工队伍中来，后来又辗转北上，攻巴山，战秦岭，修完了宝成路。去年调到柳州铁路管理局当养路工，这次是回家接妻子去的。
    然而，在他的身旁，并无他的妻子。
    我有点奇怪，便问他：“老婆没有一路走吗？”
    他笑了笑告诉我：老婆当然很愿意跟着他去广西，但乡人民委员会不同意。乡人民委员会的同志对他们说，农业生产很重要，工人家属都接出去，农业的生产人口变成城市的消费人口，对国家、对自己都不好。因此，老婆就留在家乡了。
    我又问他：“那么，你思想通吗？”
    “那有什么不通的？国家的政策嘛，国家比我们看得远。再说，搭火车回家也方便。你看！我出来才几天，这又往回走了。将来川黔路，黔桂路修通了，更方便了。”
    接着，他又大谈其养路工作的重要性，好像唯恐别人小看了他的职业。他说，养路工作有时比新线的建设工作还紧张。线路出了毛病，要抢修，不能因为下班时间到了丢下不管。火车在自己养护的地段出了事故，养路工要负责……
    他热心的谈着，使人感到他对自己的工作是那样的热爱。这种对工作的爱情，使我想起了另一个相识的人，武汉长江大桥工程局一位老工程师顾懋勋。这位年已花甲的老人向往于修建武汉长江大桥久矣，直到白了少年头才如愿以偿。那时，他是多么的欣喜，多么的满足，他觉得自己的一生再也没有别的要求了，武汉长江大桥落成之日，他一生的技术作业也可以结束了。但后来，武汉长江大桥的工程接近尾声，他又舍不得离去。他对别人说：“我要修正我过去的想法，我要以武汉长江大桥的建成，作为我个人投身我国大桥建设事业的开始。”
    顾懋勋、蹇国清，有的是知名人物，有的是“无名小卒”，但他们都热爱自己的工作。这样的人在铁路上何止万千？我国铁路事业的发展，正是依靠着这些人的努力。有了这样热爱自己工作的人，京广铁路旅客列车的运行时间缩短十五小时的壮举，以及铁路工作各方面的跃进，有何难哉？
    夜深了。车灯暗淡，旅客纷纷入梦。蹇国清也倦了。他靠在椅背上，顺手撩过窗帘往脸上一蒙，呼呼大睡起来；睡得那样香，那样甜，就好像在自己家里一样。
                （本篇完，全文待续）
