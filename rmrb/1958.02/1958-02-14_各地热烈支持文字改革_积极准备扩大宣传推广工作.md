Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee dispatched six publicity groups for language reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. From January 10th to 25th, they conducted publicity work in fourteen cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Taiyuan, Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Shenyang, and Changchun. The work received warm support from people from all walks of life. Those who participated in this publicity work included Wu Yuzhi, Wei Que, Ye Shengtao, Luo Changpei, Lü Shuxiang, Wei Jiangong, Wang Li, Zhou Youguang, Zhou Dianfu, Zheng Zhidong, Xu Shirong, and others.

The publicity groups held fifteen report meetings and twenty-seven symposiums in various regions. Approximately 30,000 people listened to the recorded report "The Current Task of Language Reform" by CPPCC National Committee Chairman Zhou Enlai, and the recorded report by Committee Member Hu Qiaomu on the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme at the report meetings. After listening to the recorded reports, they expressed their support for the current language reform policy and their willingness to actively participate in the publicity and promotion work of language reform. Participants in the symposiums, including People's Representatives, CPPCC members, responsible persons from relevant local government departments, and people from cultural, educational, news, publishing, and broadcasting circles, as well as language workers, unanimously agreed that the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme promulgated by the State Council was a significant step forward compared to the original draft. It inherited the advantages of various past phonetic schemes and avoided their shortcomings. It is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of experts and the masses. Primary and secondary school teachers believe that it is not difficult to learn the phonetic alphabet based on existing Putonghua (Mandarin) learning, and that teaching the phonetic alphabet in normal schools, primary and secondary schools, and in literacy campaigns in northern dialect areas can be achieved this autumn. People in the scientific and technological community believe that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is very useful for developing science, culture, and improving technology. People in the news, publishing, and broadcasting industries expressed that they will vigorously promote it, and business circles also expressed their willingness to use phonetic alphabets to annotate on shop signs and trademarks. Various regions generally requested that after the National People's Congress discusses and approves it, the phonetic alphabet be used to annotate the names of stations, wharves, streets, public places, groups, and organizations, and that a large number of phonetic alphabet textbooks, pictures, popular reading materials, and Putonghua teaching gramophone records, movies, and slides be published, learning classes be organized, and universal learning be carried out. Ethnic minorities in the southwest expressed their hope that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will be published as soon as possible so that it can serve as a common foundation for them to create or reform their writing systems.

People from all walks of life hope that the Chinese character simplification plan will be finalized as soon as possible and continue to be simplified further. They also requested that normal schools and primary and secondary schools have sufficient time to teach Putonghua pronunciation and the phonetic alphabet.

During the publicity groups' work in various regions, Shanghai and Shaanxi Province also held language reform publicity months. Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Jilin, Liaoning, and other provinces transcribed the two reports and prepared to send people to various parts of the province to publicize them. Various regions are preparing to enrich and strengthen institutions such as the Putonghua Promotion Work Committee or establish academic organizations on language so as to be regularly responsible for the publicity and promotion of language reform.

    各地热烈支持文字改革
    积极准备扩大宣传推广工作
    新华社13日讯　政协全国委员会派出宣传文字改革和汉语拼音方案的六个宣传组，从1月10日到25日分别在北京、天津、南京、上海、西安、郑州、广州、武汉、太原、成都、重庆、昆明、沈阳、长春等十四个城市进行宣传工作，受到各地各界人士的热烈拥护和支持。参加这次宣传工作的有吴愈之、韦悫、叶圣陶、罗常培、吕叔湘、魏建功、王力、周有光、周殿福、郑之东、徐世荣等人。
    宣传组在各地举行了十五次报告会和二十七次座谈会，约有三万人在报告会上听了政协全国委员会周恩来主席所作“当前文字改革的任务”的报告录音和胡乔木委员关于汉语拼音方案草案的报告录音。他们在听了报告录音以后，对当前文字改革的方针表示拥护，并愿意积极参加文字改革的宣传推广工作。参加座谈会的人民代表、政协委员、地方政府有关部门负责人和文化、教育、新闻、出版、广播各界人士以及语文工作者一致认为，国务院公布的汉语拼音方案草案，比原草案大大地进展了一步，它继承了过去各种拼音方案的优点，避免了它们的缺点，是专家和群众相结合的集体智慧的结晶。中小学教师认为，在原有学习普通话的基础上学会拼音字母并不困难，今年秋季在师范、中小学和北方话区扫盲工作中教学拼音字母是可以作到的。科学技术界人士认为，汉语拼音方案对于发展科学、文化和改进技术有很大的用处。新闻、出版、广播界人士表示将大力展开宣传，工商界还表示愿意在招牌和商标上用拼音字母注音。各地普遍要求在全国人民代表大会讨论批准后，用拼音字母给车站、码头、街道、公共场所、团体、机关的名牌注音，并大量出版拼音字母的课本、图片、通俗读物和教学普通话的留声片、电影、幻灯等，组织学习班，普遍传习。西南少数民族人士表示，希望汉语拼音方案早日公布，以便作为他们创制或改革文字的共同基础。
    各界人士希望早日把汉字简化方案确定下来，并进一步继续简化。他们还要求师范、中小学能有充分时间用于教学普通话语音和拼音字母。
    宣传组在各地工作期间，上海市、陕西省还举行了文字改革宣传月。四川、河南、陕西、吉林、辽宁等省把两个报告转录下来，准备派人带到省内各地宣传。各地正准备充实和加强推广普通话工作委员会等机构或建立关于语文的学术团体，以便经常负责进行文字改革的宣传推广工作。
