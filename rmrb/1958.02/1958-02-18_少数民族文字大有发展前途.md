Representative Chen Yongkang reported on the creation and current trial implementation of the Miao and Buyi language schemes in Guizhou Province. He said: The Miao and Buyi language schemes, using the Latin alphabet, are welcomed by the broad masses of the two ethnic groups. Because they are easy to learn and understand, most people can learn to spell many words and phrases after studying for two hours a day for three to four months, which can be used to record work points, write letters, and record the poems and stories of their own ethnic group. When you see a word, you can pronounce it, and when you pronounce it, you know its meaning.

I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I suggest that the conference approve them.

The formulation and implementation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is a great joy for the 600 million people of our country. We, the minority nationalities, are eagerly awaiting the early formal determination and implementation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. As Director Wu Yuzhang pointed out in the "Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has many uses, one of the most significant of which is that it can be used as a common basis for the creation of writing systems for minority nationalities in our country. This is indeed the case. The situation in Guizhou Province regarding the creation of their own languages by the Miao and Buyi nationalities is a good example. Below, I would like to report to the conference on the creation and current trial implementation of the Miao and Buyi language schemes in our province, and ask for your corrections.

In recent years, under the leadership and care of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and Chairman Mao, the various economic and cultural undertakings in the ethnic minority areas of our province have greatly developed. In 1956, we were also helped to create the Miao and Buyi language schemes. After in-depth investigation and research, and after repeated discussions at representative meetings of the ethnic groups, it was unanimously decided to adopt the Latin alphabet as the alphabet of the writing system, following the common phonetic direction of the world. After the State Council announced the draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in 1957, we revised the Miao and Buyi language schemes on the basis of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, and basically converged the letters that could be converged with the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. This has greatly facilitated the development and enrichment of ethnic minority languages through the absorption of Han Chinese vocabulary, as well as mutual learning and communication between ethnic groups. The two language schemes have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Miao and Buyi people. For example, Long Changyun, an 80-year-old Miao man in Songtao County, said: "For thousands of years, we Miao people have been like blind people with their eyes open. Now that we have our own Miao language, our children and grandchildren will no longer be like us."

With the consent of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Miao and Buyi language schemes began to be tested and implemented in the standard pronunciation areas of various languages in our province in September 1957. Four pilot points were set up for Miao language and two pilot points were set up for Buyi language, with a total of 317 people participating in the study. In the pilot work, the enthusiasm of the ethnic minority people to learn their own languages is very high. They all said: "Learning our own languages is a great joy." Everyone rushed to sign up for school. Some were afraid that they would not be able to participate in the study, so they lit torches in the middle of the night to sign up and ask to be admitted. When the number of places was full and they could not register, some insisted on sitting in and learning. Many students, in addition to studying at night, also used their rest time during the day to review.

For Miao and Buyi languages, studying for two hours a day, it generally takes one month to learn all the initials and finals, and at the same time, combine with the ethnic language to learn pinyin, which can be learned in three months. After three or four months of study, most students can spell many words and phrases, which can be used to record work points, write letters, and record the poems and stories of their own ethnic group. For example, female student Xu Cailian said happily after being able to use Miao language to record work points: "The language I have learned is very useful. Recording work points is no longer like in the past, drawing lines and counting beans." Student Xu Shibi wrote a letter to Chairman Mao in Miao language, which said: "Chairman Mao: I have never studied before, but now I can write to you with my own hands. I really don't know how to thank you. We work during the day and study at night, and we are having a very good time." Among the 58 students studying in the Buyi language pilot program in Huaxi, after more than four months of study, more than 30 people were able to use the language to keep accounts, record work points, write ethnic poems, and write letters. Therefore, from the results of the teaching experiment, it proves that the Miao and Buyi languages are easy to learn, have few strokes, are easy to write, and are beautiful phonetic languages. The Miao and Buyi people like them very much. The teaching effect is good. Because the language itself has many advantages, students can pronounce the words they see, and know the meaning of the words they pronounce, and the students' learning enthusiasm is very high. Therefore, once taught, the language is quickly accepted by the masses and can be specifically applied to actual production and life. These facts fully prove that when the Party and the government helped us create the language, it was entirely correct for us to determine the common phonetic direction of the world and to create and revise the Miao and Buyi language schemes on the basis of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. The development prospects of our ethnic minority languages are very promising.

However, in the process of creating and experimenting with the Miao and Buyi language schemes, we also encountered some problems. For example, on the issue of borrowing Chinese vocabulary, some comrades among our ethnic minority cadres have different views, advocating not borrowing or borrowing less; some advocate that if we want to borrow, there should be a proportional limit, etc. Of course, we should fully apply the vocabulary of our own ethnic language, which is certain. However, in the vocabulary of our ethnic minorities, some words are simply not available. And these words are particularly needed in the political and economic life of our ethnic minorities today. For example, "Communist Party," "Socialism," "Cooperative," "Tractor," etc. Obviously, the proposition of not borrowing Chinese vocabulary is wrong and is not conducive to the development of our ethnic language.

Now that we have Miao and Buyi languages, do we still need to learn Chinese? The answer is yes. We must learn. In addition to learning our own ethnic languages, we must also use the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme to learn Chinese. Only through mutual learning, especially learning the long-standing culture of the Han nationality, can it be conducive to the development of the culture of all ethnic groups in the motherland.

In the past eight years, our ethnic minorities have truly had many joys, and life is getting better day by day. Land reform, agricultural collectivization, the establishment of regional autonomous regimes, and now the creation of ethnic minority languages. I believe that in the future, after the implementation of the Miao and Buyi language schemes, it will definitely play a great role in promoting our socialist construction.

### 少数民族文字大有发展前途

    少数民族文字大有发展前途
    陈永康代表报告贵州省苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案草案的创制和目前试验推行情况。他说：用拉丁字母作字母的苗族和布依族文字方案，受到两个民族广大人民的欢迎。因为易学易懂，多数人每天学习二小时经过三、四个月的学习，就能拼写很多辞汇，用来记工分、写信和记录本民族的诗歌、故事。见字就能读音，念音就知道了字义。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告，并建议大会通过。
    汉语拼音方案草案的制订和推行，是我国六亿人民的大喜事。我们少数民族人民，迫切地等待着汉语拼音方案及早正式确定和推行。正如吴玉章主任在“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”中所指出的，汉语拼音方案有着许多用处，其中的显著用处之一，就是：它可以用来作为我国少数民族创造文字的共同基础。事实确实是这样。贵州省苗族、布依族创造本民族文字的情况，就是一个很好的证明。下面，我想把我省苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案草案的创制和目前试验推行的情况，向大会作个汇报，请代表们指正。
    几年来，在党中央、国务院和毛主席的领导和关怀下，我省民族地区的各项经济文化事业，都有了很大的发展。一九五六年又帮助我们创立了苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案。这两个方案经过深入的调查研究，经过召开本民族代表会议的反复讨论，一致决议采用了拉丁字母作文字的字母，走世界共同的拼音方向。一九五七年国务院公布汉语拼音方案草案以后，以汉语拼音方案为基础，我们对苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案草案进行了修订，基本上已把能和汉语拼音方案汇通的字母，使其汇通了。这样，对我们少数民族文字吸收汉族词汇来发展和丰富民族语言，以及各民族之间的互相学习和互相交际，都有很大的方便。两种文字方案受到了广大苗族和布依族人民群众的热烈欢迎。如松桃县有一个八十岁的苗族老人龙昌云说：“我们苗家几千年都是张起眼睛的瞎子，现在有了苗家自己的文字，我们的子孙，以后就不再像我们那样了。”
    苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案，经过中央民族事务委员会的同意，一九五七年九月开始在我省各个文字的标准音点地区试验推行。苗文搞了四个试验点，布依文搞了两个试验点，共三百一十七人参加学习。试点工作中，少数民族人民群众学习本民族文字的热情是非常高的。他们都说：“学习本民族文字，是一件大喜事。”大家争先报名入学。有的怕不能参加学习，深更半夜点着火把去报名，要求入学。学习名额满了，报不上名，有的就坚持旁听学习。许多学员除了夜间学习外，还利用白天干活休息的时间来进行复习。
    苗文、布依文，每日学习二小时，一般经过一个月就学会了全部声母和韵母，同时结合民族语言学习拼音，三个月即可学会。多数学员经过三、四个月学习以后，就能拼写很多辞汇，用来记工分、写信和记录本民族的诗歌、故事。如女学员许才莲能用苗文记工分后，高兴地说：“我学习的文字有了大用处，记工分再也不像过去一样，划道道、数豆豆了。”学员许士璧用苗文给毛主席写了一封信，信上说：“毛主席：我过去没有念过书，可是我现在能够亲手给你写信了。我真不知道怎样来感激你。我们白天干活，晚上念书，我们的日子过得很好。”在花溪布依文试点学习的五十八个学员中，经过四个多月的学习之后，就有三十多人能够用文字来记账、记工分、写民族诗歌和写信。所以，从教学试验的结果来看，证明了苗族文字和布依族文字是好学习、笔划少好书写和美观的拼音文字，苗族，布依族人民很喜欢。教学的效果是良好的。由于文字本身具备了许多优点，学员见字就能读音，念音就知道了字义，加以学员的学习情绪又很高，因此，一经教学，文字就很快为群众所接受，并能把它具体运用到实际生产和生活中去。这些事实，充分证明了党和政府帮助我们创造文字时，我们确定走世界共同的拼音方向，以汉语拼音方案为基础来创制和修订苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案是完全正确的。我们民族文字的发展前途，是大有希望的。
    但是，在苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案创制和试验推行的过程中，也逢到一些问题。比如在借用汉语词汇问题上，在我们少数民族干部中，有的同志有不同的看法，主张不借或少借；有的主张要借就应该有比例限制等。当然，我们应该充分应用本民族语言词汇，这是肯定的。但是，在我们少数民族词汇中，有些词汇就根本没有。而这些词汇，在今天我们少数民族的政治、经济生活中又特别需要。比如：“共产党”、“社会主义”、“合作社”、“拖拉机”等。显然，不借汉语词汇的主张是错误的，是不利于我们民族文字的发展的。
    有了苗文、布依文以后，我们是不是还需要学习汉文呢？答复是肯定的。要学习。我们除了学习本民族语文外，还要运用汉语拼音方案善于去学习汉语汉文。只有互相学习，特别是学习汉族的悠久文化，才有利于祖国各民族文化的发展。
    八年来，我们少数民族真是喜事重重，日子过得一天比一天好。土地改革、农业合作化、建立区域自治政权，现在又创立了民族文字。我相信，将来苗族文字方案和布依族文字方案推行后，对我们的社会主义建设事业，一定会起到很大的促进作用。
