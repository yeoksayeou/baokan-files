Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 22nd: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said on the 21st that if any of the passengers on the Syngman Rhee civil aviation aircraft that defected to northern Korea on February 16th wish to return home, they are free to go wherever they want. He pointed out that if the South Korean authorities truly want to know the wishes of those who want to return home, and have even the slightest concern for fulfilling those wishes, they have no reason not to hold direct negotiations with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The spokesman said in response to a question from a reporter of the Korean Central News Agency that we believe that whether the wishes of those who want to go where they want to go can be realized depends entirely on Syngman Rhee's attitude. He said that Syngman Rhee seems to have no intention of fulfilling these people's wishes, but is more eager to use the incident of this aircraft flying north to incite public sentiment.

The spokesman said that those who took this plane came to the northern part of the Republic to oppose the US imperialists' policy of aggression against South Korea and to find a way to survive. Because they found that it was no longer possible to live under the increasingly deteriorating fascist oppression and tyranny of the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The spokesman refuted the lies spread by the Syngman Rhee clique and the US ruling circles about the aircraft being forced to fly to the north by the people of the northern part of the Republic. He said that the lies and slanders of the Syngman Rhee clique and the US ruling circles are not worth refuting, because they are used to reversing black and white. If the Syngman Rhee clique and the US ruling circles mean that we can sit still in Pyongyang and bring a plane flying from Busan to Seoul to the north, then, frankly, we cannot bear such excessive praise.

The spokesman said that there are a total of thirty-four people on the plane, including four foreigners. Since they came to the northern part of the Republic, they have been doing very well, they are in good health, and they have received warm care and humane treatment. Therefore, they themselves have expressed their satisfaction and gratitude.

    朝鲜外务省发言人谈起义民航机问题
    驳斥美李集团的恶意捏造
    新华社平壤22日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人在21日说，如果在2月16日起义飞到朝鲜北部的那架李承晚民航飞机上的乘客中有人希望回家，他们可以随便到他们愿意去的地方。他指出，如果南朝鲜当局真正想要知道那些愿意回家的人的希望，并且对实现这些人的愿望稍微关怀的话，它们就没有理由不同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府直接举行谈判。
    这位发言人在回答朝鲜中央通讯社记者提出的问题时说，我们认为，那些希望到他们愿意去的地方的人的愿望能否实现，完全取决于李承晚的态度。他说，李承晚似乎无意实现这些人的愿望，而是更加热衷于利用这架飞机飞到北方来的这件事来煽动群众的情绪。
    发言人说，那些乘这架飞机的人是为了反对美帝国主义者对南朝鲜的侵略政策和寻找活路，而到共和国北部来的。因为他们发现在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的日益恶化的法西斯压迫和暴政下，已经不可能再生活下去。
    这位发言人驳斥了李承晚集团和美国统治集团散布的关于这架飞机是被共和国北部的人用强力迫使飞到北部的谎言。他说，李承晚集团和美国统治集团的谎话和诽谤是不值得一驳的，因为他们惯于颠倒黑白。如果李承晚集团和美国统治集团意思是说，我们坐在平壤一动也不动就能够把一架从釜山飞往汉城的飞机弄到北部来，那么，坦白地说，这种过分的夸奖是我们受不了的。
    发言人说，在这架飞机上总共有三十四个人，其中包括四名外国人。自从他们来到共和国北部以来，他们的情况都很好，身体也很健康，并且受到热情的照顾和人道的待遇。因此，他们自己都表示很满意和感激。
