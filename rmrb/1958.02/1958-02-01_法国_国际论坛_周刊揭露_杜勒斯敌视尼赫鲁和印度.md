Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Paris news: The French "International Forum" weekly reported that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in a report, told official or unofficial American representatives sent to India that their primary task was to do everything possible to weaken the influence of India's neutral foreign policy.

The "International Forum" weekly published a Washington dispatch on January 17th titled "Dulles, the Americans, and India," stating that in early December of last year, Dulles gave a report on American Asian policy to a training class of Americans sent to work in India. The dispatch said, "We have heard a vivid account of certain parts of the report from someone who listened to it."

The weekly said that Dulles emphasized in the report that the U.S. government and he himself were very uneasy about the spread of neutralism in Asia, the role played by India, and the influence of its neutralist foreign policy on other Asian countries. Therefore, Dulles pointed out to these future official or unofficial American representatives in India that their primary task was to do everything possible to weaken this influence.

Dulles also said in the report that India's second five-year plan for economic development was encountering great difficulties in its implementation, and if this plan failed, it would have a significant impact on India's prestige. In that case, Dulles said, it would not be useless to make no effort to "reduce the difficulties India faces in implementing the five-year plan."

The weekly reported that Dulles commended the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi for providing a "good example" in supporting pro-American groups, which also opposed any form of state economic intervention and the development of a state-owned economy. In this regard, Dulles particularly emphasized the activities of groups such as the "Free Enterprise Forum," pointing out that these groups should receive the full support of Americans in "all necessary forms."

The weekly said that the person who attended Dulles' special course also emphasized that Dulles' tone was sometimes激烈的，he unreservedly attacked Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government. He was particularly agitated when he talked about Goa, calling India's demands an "arrogant conspiracy"! Dulles believed that it was India who was treating Goa as a "colonizer," while "Portugal was only fighting for the independence of a territory it had owned for hundreds of years."

　　法国“国际论坛”周刊揭露
    杜勒斯敌视尼赫鲁和印度
    新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：法国“国际论坛”周刊报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯在一次报告中对派往印度的美国正式或非正式代表说，他们的首要任务是竭尽努力削弱印度中立外交政策的影响。
    “国际论坛”周刊1月17日刊载以 “杜勒斯、美国人和印度”为题的华盛顿通讯说，去年12月初，杜勒斯在一个派往印度去活动的美国人训练班上报告了美国的亚洲政策。通讯说，“我们曾经听到一个听了这篇报告的人生动地叙述了报告的某些内容。”
    这家周刊说，杜勒斯在报告中着重指出：美国政府和他自己对于中立主义在亚洲的蔓延、对于印度所起的作用以及它的中立主义外交政策对其他亚洲国家的影响，感到十分不安。因此，杜勒斯向这些未来的美国驻印度的正式或非正式代表指出：他们的首要任务是竭尽努力削弱这种影响。
    杜勒斯在报告中还说，印度发展经济的第二个五年计划在执行中遇到很大的困难，这个计划如果失败，对印度威信会有显著的影响。既然如此，杜勒斯就说：不去作任何努力来“减少印度执行五年计划时的困难”，不是无益的。
    这家周刊报道说，杜勒斯对美国驻新德里大使馆予以嘉勉，因为它在支持亲美团体方面提供了“良好榜样”，而这些团体同时还反对任何形式的国家经济干涉，反对发展国营经济。在这一方面，杜勒斯特别着重提出“自由企业论坛”等团体的活动，指出这些团体应该得到美国人“一切必要形式”的全力支持。
    周刊说，那位听杜勒斯专门课程的人也着重指出杜勒斯作报告时的口吻有时是激烈的，他毫无顾忌地攻击尼赫鲁总理和印度政府。他谈到果阿的时候尤其来得激动，他把印度的要求称之为“傲慢无礼的阴谋”！杜勒斯认为，以“殖民者”的身份对待果阿的是印度，而“葡萄牙只是为自己在好几百年以来就拥有的一块领土的独立而斗争”。
