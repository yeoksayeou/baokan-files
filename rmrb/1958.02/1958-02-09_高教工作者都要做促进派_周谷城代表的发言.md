　　Our socialist motherland needs modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. The reports given at the conference by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang all accelerate these modernizations. I was very excited to hear them, completely agree, and express my firm support. At the same time, I feel that our higher education workers should play a more direct or indirect role in promoting the modernization of our motherland's industry, agriculture, science, and culture.

　　Higher Education Workers Should Play a Promoting Role in the Ten Measures for Culture and Education

　　In his report, Vice Premier Bo Yibo put forward ten measures for culture and education, the principle of which is the combination of mental and physical labor. In class-antagonistic societies, mental and physical labor are not allowed to be combined: moreover, the formation of exploitative and exploited relations, and the formation of ruling and ruled relations, are conditioned on the non-combination of the two. The ruling class is using the ignorance of the broad masses of working people to carry out cruel exploitation against them. Socialist society is different; sooner or later, the opposition between mental and physical labor will be eliminated. Now that our leaders have taken wise measures, colleagues in higher education should work with other educators to play a promoting role and accelerate their realization as soon as possible. The ten measures also mention the need to "vigorously launch a patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests," which should also be promoted as soon as possible. Eliminating the four pests is a matter of humanity fighting against nature. In class societies, the ruling class, fearing that it would hinder their exploitation and affect their income, did not allow the working people to fight against nature. For example, feudal landlords would rather exploit the peasants completely, not allowing them any possibility of improving sanitation conditions. Even in capitalist society, although the four pests are sometimes eliminated, due to class antagonism, the four pests are tolerated in slums. Only in socialist society, where there are no slums, is the elimination of the four pests not restricted to certain areas. This kind of health campaign, seemingly ordinary, is actually unprecedentedly great. Higher education workers should play a promoting role in this regard to ensure remarkable results.

　　Higher Education Workers Should Play a Promoting Role in the Simplification of Chinese Characters and the Pinyin Scheme

　　Promoting the Chinese Pinyin Scheme Helps Unify the National Language

　　As far as language reform is concerned, judging from Wu Yuzhang's report, the achievements in the past few years have been very good. For example, the simplification of Chinese characters conforms to both historical trends and the demands of the people; simplified Chinese characters can save half the effort in writing, which is a very effective reform. What is especially valuable is the creation of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme. The Pinyin Scheme is the only effective tool for unifying language. With this tool, the extremely ununified languages of the whole country can be gradually unified. The lack of language unity is a very backward phenomenon. In the past, feudal warlords often used the lack of language unity to create localism for their own hegemonic rule. The situation was similar in medieval Europe; it was not until the emergence of nation-states in the fifteenth century and later that each country had a unified national language. Before liberation, China was in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial era, and the situation was still the same. The separatist warlords, dominating in various places, invariably exploited the lack of language unity. The motherland after liberation is an unprecedentedly unified country in history. Today, our economic system is unified nationwide, our political system is unified nationwide, and transportation is even more accessible in all directions, meeting the needs of unification. Only language is extremely ununified nationwide, which is a very incongruous and backward phenomenon. Before the Pinyin Scheme, even if we wanted to unify the language, we suffered from the lack of a standard. For example, the two characters "Hunan" are pronounced as Fulan by some, Wulan by others, Wule by others, and even other ways by still others; everyone insists on their own opinion, and there is no consensus. Why is there no consensus? It is because there is no standard, and none is reliable. It is different now. With the Pinyin Scheme, we have obtained the standard of correct pronunciation, and we are no longer afraid of the lack of consensus; the backward phenomenon of language ununity can be completely changed, and the national language that is common throughout the country can be formed. However, this matter is not simple and requires everyone to promote it. Higher education should play a good promoting role in this regard.

　　Promoting the Chinese Pinyin Scheme Can Accelerate the Elimination of Illiteracy

　　Pinyin symbols are not only the standard of correct pronunciation, but also an excellent tool to help literacy. There are still many illiterate people in our country, which hinders the promotion of science and technology, culture and art, etc. On the one hand, we demand the combination of mental and physical labor, but on the other hand, we cannot popularize science and technology, culture and art to the broad masses of working people. This is a contradiction. How to overcome this contradiction? The only way is to quickly eliminate illiteracy so that the broad masses of working people can become literate and use writing to absorb science and technology, culture and art in a short period of time. The Chinese Pinyin Scheme is of great use here. When Wu Yuzhang mentioned the use of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme in his report, he said that Pinyin symbols can annotate Chinese characters, which can "improve the efficiency of teaching Chinese characters. First of all, it can be used to annotate textbooks for primary schools and literacy textbooks in the northern dialect area. In addition, children's books, comic strips, and popular newspapers and periodicals can also be used to annotate. In this way, children and illiterate people who are new to writing can rely on Pinyin letters to read books and newspapers, and further recognize more Chinese characters." Illiterate people can learn more Chinese characters with the help of Pinyin symbols, and literacy work can be accelerated. The broad masses of working people can quickly master a certain number of Chinese characters that they should have, so they can absorb scientific and technological knowledge through writing and enjoy cultural and artistic life. This is the ideal we can achieve soon.

　　Some Opinions on the Simplification of Chinese Characters and the Pinyin Scheme

　　The simplification of Chinese characters must continue; the Pinyin Scheme should be promoted after it is adopted by the conference. Here, I would like to offer a few small opinions for your reference: 1. When simplifying Chinese characters, it is best not to make the tasks of certain characters too heavy. Chinese characters are monosyllabic characters, and there are many homophones. When simplifying, it is impossible to make the tasks of any character not heavy and only use one character for one purpose. However, if the tasks of certain characters are too heavy, even causing confusion, it is not good and should be avoided as much as possible. For example, the character "干" has very heavy tasks: clean, interfere, several... all use it, even the "幹" in cadre is replaced by it, writing "幹部" as "干部," which is not very ideal. It is best to avoid similar examples. 2. When promoting Pinyin, can we run a small, annotated, large-character poster that is popular in rural areas as a teaching material for promoting Pinyin and also for reporting news? The paper should be at most one-eighth the size of a current newspaper; the size of the characters can be as large as the characters in the example of Pinyin symbol annotation given to us at the conference. 3. Prevent arbitrarily replacing characters with Pinyin. It is of course possible for illiterate adults to learn Pinyin symbols and occasionally use them to spell out spoken language to express their meaning. However, over time, they may give up learning Chinese characters and arbitrarily replace Chinese characters with Pinyin symbols. I don't think this is good. On the one hand, we simplify Chinese characters for the convenience of learning; on the other hand, if we arbitrarily replace Chinese characters with Pinyin symbols, it will affect learning.

　　I am not very confident that what I have said above is correct; I venture to speak it out for the representatives to consider.

专栏：

　　高教工作者都要做促进派
    周谷城代表的发言
    我们的社会主义祖国，需要现代工业，现代农业，现代科学和文化。大会上李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任的几个报告都是加速这几方面的现代化的，我听了非常兴奋，完全同意，并表示坚决拥护。同时，我觉得我们高教工作者，对于祖国工业、农业、科学和文化各方面的现代化，要多多发挥直接或间接的促进作用。
    对于文教方面的十项措施  高教工作者要起促进作用
    薄一波副总理在报告中提出了关于文化教育方面的十项措施，其原则即是脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合。在阶级对立的社会里，脑力劳动与体力劳动是不许结合的：而且剥削与被剥削的关系之构成，统治与被统治的关系之构成，正以这两者不相结合为条件。统治阶级正利用着广大劳动人民的无知，对他们进行残酷的剥削。社会主义社会不然，迟早要消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的对立。现在，我们的领导既已采取英明措施，高教界的同人就应与其他各方面的教育工作者一道，发挥促进作用，促其及早实现。十项措施中又提到要“大张旗鼓开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动”，这也是要促其及早实现的。除四害是人类与自然作斗争的事情。在阶级社会里，统治阶级怕妨碍他们的剥削，影响他们的收入，不让劳动人民向自然作斗争。例如封建地主，宁愿把农民剥得精光，不让他们有任何可能去改善卫生条件。就是在资本主义社会里，虽未尝不除四害；然因阶级对立的原故，在贫民窟里却是纵容四害的。只有社会主义社会，既没有贫民窟，除四害更不分区。这种卫生运动，看似寻常，其实是空前伟大的。高教工作者对此，要发挥促进作用，促使成效卓著。
    对于汉字简化和拼音方案  高教工作者要起促进作用
　　推行汉语拼音方案  有助全国语言统一
　　至于文字改革，就吴玉老的报告看，几年以来，成绩非常好。例如汉字的简化，既合乎历史的趋势，又合乎人民的要求；简化了的汉字，书写起来，可省力一半，这是非常有效的改革。尤其可贵的，是汉语拼音方案的制成。拼音方案是统一语言的唯一有效工具。凭这工具，可以把全国极不统一的语言逐步统一起来。语言的不统一，是一种极落后的现象。过去的封建军阀，常利用语言的不统一，造成地方主义，以便自己称霸称王。欧洲中世纪，情形是如此的；直到十五世纪及以后，民族国家出现，各国才有统一的国语。中国在解放以前，半封建半殖民地时代，情形还是如此的。割据的军阀，在各地方称霸称王，未尝不利用语言的不统一。解放以后的祖国，是历史上空前未有的统一国家。今天我们的经济制度是全国统一的，政治制度是全国统一的，交通运输更是四通八达，合于统一的需要。唯有语言，全国极不统一，这是很不相称的落后现象。在没有拼音方案以前，即是要统一语言，也苦于没有标准。例如“湖南”两个字，有人说成Fulan，有人说成Wulan，有人说成Wule，更有人说成其他的样子；各执一词，莫衷一是。为什么莫衷一是呢？就是由于没有标准，无一是可衷。今后不然了，有了拼音方案，获得了正音的标准，不怕莫衷一是了；语言方面不统一的落后现象可以彻底改变了，通行全国的国语可以形成了。不过这事并不简单，尚待大家来促进。高教界于此，应好好地发挥促进作用。
　　推行汉语拼音方案  可以加快扫盲工作
    拼音符号固然是正音的标准，更是帮助识字的绝好工具。我们国内还有很多不识字的人，这于推广科学技术、文化艺术等是有妨碍的。我们一方面要求脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合，同时却又不能把科学技术、文化艺术等普及于广大劳动群众中，这是一个矛盾。如何克服这个矛盾呢？唯一办法就是赶快扫除文盲，使广大劳动人民，在短期内，个个都能识字，个个都能运用文字来吸收科学技术、文化艺术等。汉语拼音方案在这里有绝大的用处。吴玉老在报告中提到汉语拼音方案的用处时说拼音符号给汉字注音，可以“提高教学汉字的效率。首先可以用来在小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本上注音。此外，如儿童读物、连环图画、通俗报刊也可以用用来注音。这样，初学文字的儿童和文盲，就可以依靠拼音字母来阅读书报，并且进一步认识更多汉字”。不识字的人，可以借拼音符号的帮助，可以多识汉字，扫盲工作可以加速地进行；广大劳动人民很快就可以掌握应有的一定数量的汉字，从而可以憑文字吸收科学技术知识，可以享受文化艺术生活。这将是我们很快可以达到的理想。
　　对汉字简化和拼音方案的几点意见
    汉字简化还要继续进行；拼音方案，经大会通过后就要推广。我在这里且提出几个小小的意见，供大家参考：一、简化汉字时，最好不让某些字的任务太繁重。汉字是单音字，同音的多，简化时，要任何字的任务都不繁重，而只一字一用，那是不可能的。不过某些字的任务如果太繁重，甚至引起混乱，那就不好，最宜避免。例如“干”字，任务就是很繁重的：干净、干涉、若干……都用它，甚至连干部的“幹”字也用它来代替，把“幹”部写成“干”部，那就不甚合理想。类此的例子最好避免。二、推广拼音时，可否办一种小型注音大字报，在农村里流行，作为推广拼音的教材，兼作报道新闻之用。纸张至多只要现在一张报纸的八分之一那么大；字的大小可用大会发给我们的拼音符号注音举例的字那么大。三、防止任意以拼音代替文字。不识字的成年人，学会了拼音符号，偶而用来拼写口语，以表达意思，那当然是可以的。但久而又久，可能放弃汉字不学，而用拼音符号任意代替汉字。这样作，我想不好。我们一方面简化汉字，为的是便于学习；倘另一方面又用拼音符号任意代替汉字，那便会影响学习。
    以上所说，是否正确，自信力就不甚强；冒昧讲出，供代表们参考。
