I fully agree with all the reports of the conference.

I would now like to discuss the main situation of Hunan Province's organization of a great leap forward in agricultural production.

Since the beginning of winter, on the basis of the great victory of the struggle against the bourgeois rightists and the nationwide rectification movement, and on the basis of thoroughly opposing right-leaning conservative thought, and encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program, more than 30 million farmers in Hunan Province have devoted themselves with revolutionary heroism to the winter agricultural production movement centered on water conservancy construction and increased fertilizer accumulation, and have begun to set off an immense and magnificent upsurge in the great leap forward in agricultural production, full of confidence to complete and over fulfill the agricultural production targets of Hunan Province in 1958.

Great Achievements in Water Conservancy Construction and Fertilizer Accumulation in the Winter Agricultural Production Movement

According to preliminary statistics, in the past month, an average of more than 13.37 million people across the province have participated in various production movements every day, accounting for 44 percent of the total rural population of the province. The total labor days for water conservancy construction plans in the province is more than 280 million, and more than 200 million have been completed, accounting for 71 percent of the plan. The number of large and small water conservancy projects built throughout the province has expanded from the original plan of more than 790,000 to more than 1,145,000, and more than 600,000 have been completed. Among these water conservancy projects, there are 8,211 newly built reservoirs, which is more than one and a half times the total number of 3,213 newly built reservoirs since the liberation of the province eight years ago, and 42 times more than the 195 reservoirs built during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The completion of these water conservancy projects can increase the irrigation area by more than 1.9 million mu and improve the irrigation area by more than 14 million mu. In the water conservancy construction movement, labor competitions were widely carried out throughout the province. Thousands of people braved wind and rain, broke ice and frost, opened mountains and chiseled rocks, built canals and diverted water. After nightfall, they lit torches and gas lamps, the voices were boiling, the scene was hot, and they fought day and night to eliminate drought and flood disasters. In Xiangtan County, 320,000 people worked during the day and 150,000 people worked at night. The gas lamps in the county seat and market towns were almost sold out and borrowed. The county's water conservancy project plan, which originally required 7 million labor days, was completed by the end of last year with 7.2 million labor days. According to the current number of workers and progress, the province's water conservancy project plan can be successfully completed around the Spring Festival.

The task of accumulating 4 billion dan of fertilizer before spring plowing was completed in mid-January, and now we are working hard to complete the task of accumulating 11.7 billion dan of fertilizer this year. The characteristics of this year's fertilizer accumulation movement are large scale, many methods, good quality, and fast progress, and the advanced fertilizer accumulation experience of "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" in Liling County (the "Four Diligences" are diligent sweeping, diligent padding, diligent removal, and diligent burning, and the "Eight Haves" are cattle have pens, pigs have sties, ash has houses, manure has ponds, fields have grass seeds, there are manure pits in all seasons, people have toilets, and chickens and ducks have coops) has been widely promoted throughout the province, in order to guide the masses to make fertilizer accumulation a regular movement. In order to solve the fertilizer problems required for agricultural production increase from many aspects, we also expanded the green manure sowing area last winter, and this year we plan to reserve 1 million mu of green manure seeds to gradually solve the problem of self-sufficiency of green manure seeds. Zhuzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant and Shimen Defluorinated Phosphate Fertilizer Plant are actively preparing for construction, and the output of superphosphate and granular fertilizer will be more than doubled this year compared with last year. We have also vigorously bred pigs. At the end of last year, the number of pigs in stock in the province had reached 10 million. In Wangcheng County, there were only 120,000 pigs in 1953, which increased to 190,000 in 1956, and then jumped to 600,000 in 1957, with an average of 6 pigs per household. The total output value of pigs accounted for 22.8 percent of the county's total industrial and agricultural output value. Liushahe Township, Ningxiang, a famous place for the production of improved pig breeds, had a total of 3,585 large pigs and 33,024 small pigs in 1956, with an average of 8.2 pigs per household. In 1957, the total number of pigs in the township developed to more than 54,000, with an average of 12.3 pigs per household. What is particularly outstanding is Liushahe Cooperative, which has 792 households, with an average of 18 pigs per household. Developing pigs is a "one move with multiple gains". In terms of fertilizer accumulation alone, at the end of September 1957, the number of pigs in stock in the province was 9 million, which could provide about 400 million dan of high-quality fertilizer. Each dan of pig manure can increase grain production by at least 8 jin, and 400 million dan of pig manure can increase grain production by more than 3 billion jin. This year we plan to increase pig production by 20 percent, and by the end of the year, the number of pigs in stock will reach 12 million.

In terms of winter planting and spring harvesting crops, a total of 31 million mu has been completed (including 11 million mu of food crops), exceeding the original plan of 28.9 million mu by 7 percent. At present, the general growth is good. As long as we pay attention to field management and topdressing, there is great hope for a bumper harvest.

Which Links to Grasp in the Great Leap Forward

From the above situation, it seems that agricultural production in Hunan has begun a great leap forward. The responsibility of the leadership lies in taking all effective measures to vigorously promote this leap forward and promote its realization. In order to achieve this goal, our province is grasping the following links to carry out work.

First, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate right-leaning conservative thought. At present, right-leaning conservative thought is manifested in the fact that some people still hold a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude towards the production upsurge. They are unwilling to resolutely join the masses and throw themselves into the battle. In order to correct this erroneous thought, we must strengthen political and ideological education, thoroughly criticize the errors of right-leaning conservative thought, and use advanced figures and advanced deeds to educate them, so that they can deeply understand the endless potential after the change of production relations and the liberation of productive forces, believe in the great power of the masses, believe in the great role of the victory of the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, and believe in the great role of the leadership of the Party, so that they can transform from right-leaning conservative thought to active and progressive thought, from promoters of retreat to promoters of progress, from waiting and seeing to riding the wind and waves and bravely moving forward. Bailu Township in Changsha County, because it started early and grasped tightly, basically completed the original water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation plan in mid-November last year. Later, according to the wishes of the masses and the in-depth work of the township Party committee, it greatly expanded the original plan and mobilized the masses to fight hard for 25 days, resulting in the renovation of a 40-mile-long river and the dredging of more than 3,800 mountain ditches, so that the mountain flood disasters that raged several times a year could be controlled. This is an example of man conquering nature and breaking the status quo. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must step out of the organs, go deep into the grassroots, go deep into the masses, eliminate all right-leaning conservative thoughts, boost revolutionary vigor, strive for progress, and leap forward again and again in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. At present, we should quickly prepare for spring plowing to meet this tense battle of spring plowing production.

Second, we must carry out the rural rectification movement deeply and thoroughly, thoroughly criticize capitalist ideas in the countryside, and fully promote socialist ideas. Since the socialist debate on grain issues in September last year, a sharp two-road debate has unfolded in the rural areas of the province, giving a heavy blow to capitalist ideas, and the rural rectification movement has been launched accordingly, quickly forming an upsurge of socialist ideological education. This upsurge and the upsurge of agricultural production rose simultaneously and promoted each other, thus causing tremendous changes in the countryside, with the socialist wind overwhelming the capitalist wind. At present, the rectification of the first batch of 800 agricultural cooperatives has generally ended and has fully turned to production. The more than 23,000 agricultural cooperatives in the second batch of rectification have generally entered the stage of systematic rectification and reform. The rectification of the more than 27,000 agricultural cooperatives in the third batch has been fully launched in mid-January, and it is expected that the rural rectification movement in the province will come to an end by the end of February and the beginning of March. After rectification, a large number of Class III cooperatives have been raised to the level of Class I or Class II cooperatives, and the backward appearance has begun to change. However, there are also a few Class III cooperatives that have not improved much in the process of rectification. We are taking effective measures to resolutely change the appearance of a few Class III cooperatives before spring plowing in order to consolidate the socialist position in the countryside and expand the political and ideological foundation for the great leap forward in agricultural production.

Third, all cadres must earnestly improve their working methods and working styles so as to adapt themselves to the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production. Through the rectification of organs, great achievements have been made in this regard: the transfer of 100,000 cadres can be basically completed before the Spring Festival; cadres participating in labor and engaging in experimental fields have become a trend. More than 62,300 cadres in the province have engaged in more than 100,030 mu of experimental fields. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties, 7,000 cadres bought 16,000 pieces of agricultural implements. Several comrades from the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee also engaged in more than 20 mu of experimental fields at the Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute. In the past, some cadres who wore shoes, held notebooks, and walked with airs have now become cadres who are barefoot and bald, holding hoes, and taking the lead in production, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers, greatly strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses and the relationship between cadres and the masses. However, we must consolidate these correct practices ideologically, organizationally, and institutionally.

Fourth, we must tap the potential of all aspects and vigorously support agriculture. The production potential of our province is very large: at present, the unit area yield of crops is very unbalanced. Under basically the same natural conditions, the yield of rice is more than 1,000 jin per mu in some places, while it is only 300 to 400 jin in others. There are about 12 million to 15 million mu of low-yield fields in the province. As long as we have determination and methods, these low-yield fields can completely leap forward to high-yield fields. There are also mountainous areas that account for 60 percent of the total area of the province, which are rich in treasures. Tea oil alone has more than 11 million mu, and more than 7 million mu have been reclaimed. We have decided to issue more than 10 million yuan of interest-free loans for oil tea in 1958 to support the reclamation and construction of new oil tea forests. Potential exists in all directions and in all places. The problem is that we must mobilize and rely on the broad masses to actively tap it. Some people say that production has reached its peak and the potential has been exhausted. This statement is groundless. Therefore, we must mobilize and organize the forces of industry, handicrafts, transportation, finance and trade, culture, education and health, small and medium-sized towns, and the army to give active support to agricultural production in terms of manpower, financial resources, materials, technology, and politics. The actions of Zhuzhou City to fully support agricultural production have become a typical example of strengthening the socialist worker-peasant alliance and establishing socialist urban-rural relations. We are planning to promote it throughout the province in a planned way.

The new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the overall economic upswing in the province has arrived, and the enthusiasm of the people of the province to forge ahead is surging and constantly rising. In the winter production campaign, we have achieved a great victory. In the upcoming tense spring plowing campaign, we will achieve even greater victories. We have firm confidence that, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will unite the people of the province, move from victory to victory, and complete the combat task of a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

    冬季生产战役胜利很大  春耕战役争取更大胜利
    谭余保代表介绍湖南省声势浩大的农业生产高潮
    我完全同意大会的各项报告。
    我现在谈谈当前湖南省组织农业生产大跃进的主要情况。
    入冬以来，在反对资产阶级右派斗争和全民性整风运动的伟大胜利和彻底反对右倾保守思想的基础上，在全国农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，湖南省三千多万农民以革命的英雄气概，投入了以兴修水利、增积肥料为中心的冬季农业生产运动，并且开始掀起了声势浩大，波澜壮阔的农业生产大跃进的高潮，满怀信心地为完成和超额完成湖南省一九五八年农业生产的指标任务而英勇奋斗。
    在冬季农业生产运动中  修水利积肥料成就很大
    据初步统计，一个月来，全省平均每天有一千三百三十七万人以上参加各种生产运动，占全省农村总人数百分之四十四。全省兴修水利计划，劳动工日共二亿八千多万个，目前已完成二亿多个，为计划的百分之七十一。全省兴修大、小水利工程，已由原计划的七十九万多处扩大到一百一十四万五千多处，目前已完成六十多万处。在这些水利工程中，新建水库有八千二百一十一座，比全省解放八年以来新建水库的总和三千二百一十三座多了一倍半，比国民党反动派统治时期所建的一百九十五座水库多了四十二倍。完成这些水利工程，可以增加灌溉面积一百九十多万亩，改善灌溉面积一千四百多万亩。在兴修水利运动中，全省各地普遍开展了劳动竞赛。万千群众，冒风雨，破冰冻，开山凿石，修渠引水，入夜之后，打火把，点汽灯，人声沸腾，热火朝天，夜以继日地为消灭水旱灾害而战斗着。湘潭县白天有三十二万人出工，晚上有十五万人抢修，县城、集镇的汽灯，几乎卖光借尽。该县原订七百万个劳动日的水利工程计划，到去年年底即已完成七百二十万个劳动工日。按照目前的出工人数和进度来看，全省水利工程计划可以在春节前后胜利完成。
    春耕前积肥四十亿担的任务在一月中旬即已完成，现在正为完成今年积肥一百一十七亿担的任务而努力。全省每天有三百万人参加积肥，平均每天积肥四千万担。今年积肥运动的特点，是规模大、办法多、质量好、进度快，并且在全省广泛推行了醴陵县的“四勤八有”的先进积肥经验（“四勤”即勤扫、勤垫、勤出、勤烧，“八有”即牛有栏、猪有圈、灰有屋、粪有池、田里有草子、四季有粪凼、人有厕所、鸡鸭有埘），以便引导群众把积肥成为一种经常性的运动。为了从多方面解决农业增产所需要的肥料问题，我们去冬还扩大了绿肥播种面积，今年计划绿肥留种一百万亩，逐步解决绿肥种子自给问题。株洲氮肥厂和石门脱氟磷肥厂正在积极筹建，过磷酸钙和颗粒肥料的产量今年都将比去年增加一倍多。我们还大力繁殖了生猪，去年年底，全省生猪存栏数已经达到一千万头。望城县的生猪一九五三年只有十二万头，一九五六年增至十九万头，到一九五七年就跃进到六十万头，平均每户六头，生猪总产值占该县工农业总产值的百分之二十二点八。良种生猪名产地的宁乡流沙河乡，一九五六年共有大猪三千五百八十五头，小猪三万三千零二十四头，每户平均养猪八点二头；一九五七年全乡生猪发展到五万四千多头，每户平均养猪十二点三头，其中特别突出的是流沙河社，七百九十二户，每户平均养猪十八头。发展生猪是“一举数得”的事，仅就积肥一项来说，一九五七年九月底，全省生猪存栏数九百万头，大约可提供四亿担优质肥料，每一担猪粪至少可以增产粮食八斤，四亿担猪粪就可以增产三十多亿斤粮食。今年我们预备增产生猪百分之二十，到年底生猪存栏数将达到一千二百万头。
    冬种春收作物方面，共完成三千一百万亩（其中有粮食作物一千一百万亩），超过原计划二千八百九十万亩的百分之七。目前一般生长情况良好，只要注意田间管理，追施肥料，大有丰收希望。
    在大跃进中抓那几个环节
    从上述形势看来，湖南农业生产已开始大跃进。领导的责任就在于采取一切有效的措施大力推动这个跃进，并促其实现。为了达到这个目的，我省正抓紧以下环节进行工作。
    第一、坚决彻底地肃清右倾保守思想。目前右倾保守思想表现在有一部分人对生产高潮仍然抱怀疑、观望态度，他们不肯坚决地同群众一起，投入战斗。为了纠正这种错误思想，必须加强政治思想教育，彻底批判右倾保守思想的错误，要用先进的人物，先进的事迹教育他们，使他们深刻认识生产关系改变、生产力解放后的无穷无尽的潜力，相信群众力量的巨大，相信政治上思想上社会主义革命胜利的巨大作用，相信党的领导的伟大作用，使他们由右倾保守思想转变为积极前进的思想，由促退派变为促进派，由观望不前变为乘风破浪，勇敢向前。长沙县有一个百禄乡，由于动手早，抓得紧，原订的水利和积肥计划在去年十一月中旬就基本完成，后来根据群众的愿望和乡党委的深入工作，大大扩大了原订计划，发动群众，苦战二十五天，结果改修了一条四十里长的河流，疏通了三千八百多条山圳，使年年数次逞凶的山洪灾害得以制服。这是人定胜天，征服自然，打破现状的范例。所以各级领导干部，都必须走出机关，深入基层，深入群众，肃清一切右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地跃进再跃进。目前应迅速作好春耕准备，以迎接春耕生产这一场紧张的大战斗。
    第二、必须把农村整风运动搞深搞透，彻底批判农村中的资本主义思想，充分发扬社会主义思想。从去年九月关于粮食问题的社会主义辩论时起，全省农村中展开了尖锐的两条道路的大论战，对资本主义思想给予了沉重的打击，并随之展开了农村整风运动，很快地形成了社会主义思想教育的高潮。这个高潮和农业生产的高潮同时兴起，互相推进，因而使农村发生了巨大的变化，社会主义之风压倒资本主义之风。目前，第一批八百个农业社的整风，一般均已结束，并已全面转入生产。第二批整风的二万三千多个农业社，一般已经进入系统整改阶段。第三批二万七千多个农业社的整风已在一月中旬全面铺开，预计二月底三月初全省农村整风运动即可告一段落。经过整风，大批三类社已提高到一类或二类社的水平，落后面貌开始改观。但也有少数三类社在整风过程中改进不大，我们正在采取有效措施，在春耕前坚决把少数三类社的面貌改变过来，以巩固农村中的社会主义阵地，扩大农业生产大跃进的政治思想基础。
    第三、所有干部必须认真地改进工作方法和工作作风，使自己适应农业生产大跃进的新形式。通过机关整风，这方面已取得很大成绩：下放十万干部，春节前可以基本完成；干部参加劳动、搞试验田已经成为一种风气。全省已有六万二千三百多干部搞了十万零三千多亩试验田。根据八个县不完全的统计，七千个干部买了一万六千件农具。省委书记处的几个同志，也在省农业科学研究所搞了二十几亩试验田。过去某些脚穿鞋子、手拿本子、走路摆架子的干部，现在变成了赤脚光头、手拿锄头、生产带头的干部，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎，大大密切了党群关系和干群关系。但还必须从思想上、组织上和制度上把这些正确作法巩固下来。
    第四、必须发掘各方面的潜力，大力支援农业。我省生产潜力是很大的：目前农作物单位面积产量很不平衡，在自然条件基本相同的情况下，稻谷产量有的每亩在千斤以上，有的却只有三、四百斤。全省约有一千二百万到一千五百万亩低产田，只要有决心，有办法，这些低产田完全可以跃进为高产田。还有占全省总面积百分之六十的山区，宝藏丰富，仅茶油一项就有一千一百多万亩，已垦复七百多万亩我们已决定在一九五八年发放油茶无息贷款一千多万元，支援垦复并营造新油茶林。潜力四路八处都有，问题在于我们必须发动和依靠广大群众积极地去发掘。有人说，生产已到顶，潜力已挖尽，这种说法是无根据的。因此，必须动员和组织工业、手工业、交通运输、财经贸易、文教卫生、中小城镇和部队等各方面的力量，在人力、财力、物力、技术、政治等方面给农业生产以积极支援，株洲市全面支援农业生产的行动，已经成为加强社会主义工农联盟和建立社会主义城乡关系的一个典型。我们正在全省有计划地予以推广。
    全省农业生产大跃进和国民经济全面高涨的新形势已经到来，全省人民奋发前进的情绪正在汹涌澎湃地不断高涨，在冬季生产的战役中，我们已取得了巨大的胜利，在即将到来的紧张的春耕战役中，我们将获得更大的胜利。我们有坚强的信心，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，团结全省人民，从胜利走向胜利，完成今年农业生产大丰收的战斗任务。
