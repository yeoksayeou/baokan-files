Capital Athletes' Ring-City Race

(Our Dispatch) Yesterday morning, the annual Spring Festival Ring-City Race was held in the capital. This was jointly organized by various news organizations in the capital.

At a little after eight in the morning, more than 1,120 long-distance runners gathered at Tiananmen Square.

At 9:20, with the referee's command, the athletes began running westward. When they reached Xidan, Dong Yaolu, a student from the Mining College who had won the runner-up position in the previous two Ring-City Races, stood out and took the lead. Approaching Xisi, Yin Hua, a worker, overtook Dong Yaolu. After passing Tieshizi Hutong, having covered more than half the distance, Dong Yaolu, with his good endurance and physical strength, exerted himself and overtook Yin Hua again, taking the lead once more. Dong Yaolu ran with increasing vigor, passing Dongsi and Dongdan, and finished the entire race in 43 minutes and 4.4 seconds, returning to Tiananmen Square first. Yin Hua reached the finish line second, with a time of 43 minutes and 12 seconds.

The results of this year's Ring-City Race were better than the previous two years. This year's sixth-place finisher was more than two minutes faster than the first-place finisher in the previous two years.

Among the more than 1,100 participants in this competition, there were workers, cadres, students, officers, and soldiers. Many of them were well-trained long-distance runners who had participated in the first and second Ring-City Races.
