    Enjoying the Ping Opera "Sanliwan"
    Ren Guilin
    Zhao Shuli's novel "Sanliwan" has long been a beloved and well-known work among readers. However, adapting it for the stage is not an easy task; because the book depicts many characters and events, making it difficult to focus. The Ping Opera "Sanliwan," adapted and performed by the China Ping Opera Theater based on this novel, better embodies the spirit of the original work and is a good play worth watching among the current theatrical repertoire reflecting real life.
    The three playwrights, Jiang Feng, Gao Chen, and Xue Enhou, omitted Yuan Tiancheng and the "Inept" family, and prominently portrayed the old middle peasant Ma Duoshou, "Always Right," and the village head Fan Denggao and Fan Lingzhi's families. This allows the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads within and outside the Party to be fully expressed; the contradictions between the collective economy and the individual economy, and the contradictions between collectivism and individualism, run through the entire play like a red thread.
    Fan Denggao and Ma Duoshou's desire to become rich is also a natural thing. However, encountering socialist transformation, this selfish ideology contradicts the Party's policies and the interests of the masses, and even conflicts with their own children. Therefore, they feel distressed, and after a painful ideological struggle, the contradictions are unified; all the pain vanishes. A large group of optimistic peasants, collectivist peasants, appearing on the theatrical stage is so exciting! Compared to the farmer images in many of our historical dramas, this can't be said to be a big "leap forward."
    In this play, the younger generation of new peasants, like Fan Lingzhi and Wang Yusheng, are intelligent, cultured, and love labor. They do not understand selfishness and only know how to work for others. Even when dating, they adopt a new, straightforward attitude.
    Directors Hu Sha and Zhang Wei handled the entire play very lively, full of wit, and with a strong comedic atmosphere. We can see that the directors not only have a relatively deep understanding of these characters in the play but also show the gains they have made after diligently learning from the traditions of opera.
    The actors participating in this play can generally complete their tasks well. Zhang Defu, who plays Fan Denggao, appropriately portrays an old Party member in the countryside who temporarily makes political mistakes but is not of bad character. Xiao Yushuang, who plays his daughter Fan Lingzhi, also simply portrays this cheerful, brave, and truth-seeking new rural girl. Song Changwen, who plays Ma Duoshou, appropriately portrays a selfish and confused person who is laughable but not evil. Zhao Lirong, who plays his wife "Always Right," also completely exposes a backward and selfish old woman.
    After watching the Ping Opera "Sanliwan," I was very moved. If the play could be more refined and have fewer threads; and if the actors had more experience of rural life. We believe that the performance of this play will reach a more perfect level.

    欢看评剧“三里湾”
    任桂林
    赵树理的小说“三里湾”，早已是读者喜爱和熟知的作品。但要把它搬上舞台，却不是件容易事；因为书中描写的人物多，事件多，很难集中。中国评剧院根据这部小说改编、上演的评剧“三里湾”，较好地体现了原著的精神，是目前戏曲剧目中，反映现实生活值得一看的好戏。
    三位剧作者江风、高琛、薛恩厚舍去了袁天成、“能不够”一家人，比较突出地刻划了老中农马多寿“常有理”和村长范登高、范灵芝这两家人。这样，使得党内、党外的社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争充分地表现出来了；集体经济和个体经济的矛盾、集体主义和个人主义的矛盾，便像一条红线似的贯串着全剧。
    范登高、马多寿要求发家致富，原也是自然的事情。但碰上社会主义改造，这种自私自利思想，就和党的政策矛盾起来，和群众的利益矛盾起来，甚至和自己的儿女也发生矛盾。因此，他们感到苦恼，经过了一场痛苦的思想斗争，矛盾统一了；一切痛苦便云消雾散。一大群充满乐观主义的农民，集体主义的农民，出现在戏曲舞台上，是多么令人兴奋！这和我们许多历史剧中的农民形象相比，不能不说也是一个大“跃进”。
    在这一出戏中，年轻一代的新农民，像范灵芝、王玉生这些人，他们聪明有文化，热爱劳动。他们不懂得为己，只知道为人。就是谈恋爱，他们也是采取一种新的、爽朗的态度。
    导演胡沙、张炜把整个剧处理得很活泼，妙趣横生，喜剧气氛十足。我们能看出导演不仅对这些剧中人有着比较深刻的了解，同时，也能够看出他们努力向戏曲传统学习后的收获。
    参加这个戏演出的演员，大都能较好地完成任务。扮演范登高的张德福，把一个农村中在政治上一时犯错误，而品质并不坏的老党员，恰当的表现出来。扮演他女儿范灵芝的筱玉霜，也朴实的表现了这一个开朗、勇敢、坚持真理的新的农村少女。宋长文扮演的马多寿，把一个自私糊涂，虽可笑但不恶的人，恰如其分的演出来。扮演他妻子“常有理”的赵丽容，也把一个落后自私的老太婆，暴露无遗。
    看了评剧“三里湾”，很受感动。如果剧作能够再精练些、头绪少些；演员对农村的生活有更多的体会。我们相信，这出戏的演出将会达到更加完满的地步了。
