    Lowering Student Grants
    Our current People's Student Grant is 12 yuan per person per month, which is 2 yuan more than the teacher's college (Dalian-Lüshun area), and our standard of living is much higher than that of most people in the country, especially the 500 million hard-working farmers. In order to better respond to the Party's call for building the country through diligence and thrift, we suggest that the government change the People's Student Grant for secondary technical schools to 10 yuan per person per month, and also suggest that the government consider appropriately adjusting and reducing the student grants for colleges and universities.
    We can see that the result of this implementation will save a considerable amount of money for the country. Dalian Machine Manufacturing School alone, with 1,200 students, can save the country 28,800 yuan per year.
    If the food expenses are reduced, will it affect our health? We don't think so. We only need to compare ourselves with the teacher's college in the same area, with the middle school students whose monthly food expenses are only 7 or 8 yuan, and with the farmers whose living standards are generally lower than ours and who bear heavy physical labor, and we can draw this conclusion.

    降低助学金
    我们现在的人民助学金是每人每月十二元，比师范学校（旅大地区）每人每月多二元，而且我们这样的生活水平较全国大多数人民特别是五亿辛勤劳动着的农民的生活水平要高得多。为了更好地响应党勤俭建国的号召，我们建议政府把中等技术学校的人民助学金改为每人每月十元，同时也建议政府考虑适当调整和降低大专学校学生的助学金。
    我们可以看到，这样实行的结果，为国家节约的数字是很可观的。仅大连机器制造学校一千二百名学生全年就可为国家节约二万八千八百元。
    伙食费减少了，会不会影响我们的身体健康呢？我们认为是不会的。我们只要比比同一地区的师范学校，比比每月伙食费只七、八元的中学生，比比生活水平一般比我们低而担负着繁重体力劳动的农民，都可以得出这个结论。
