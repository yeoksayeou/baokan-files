Representative Dao Jingban introduced the development of various undertakings in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan. He said: The people of all ethnic groups in the motherland's border regions will surely join hands with all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland to transition to a bright and happy socialist society.

I fully agree with the two reports made by Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Li Xiannian and Vice Premier and Director of the State Economic Commission Bo Yibo. In both reports, it was pointed out that the national fiscal revenue and expenditure plan for last year was overfulfilled, which not only powerfully guaranteed the victorious completion of the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, but also prepared a good foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan, making us even more full of confidence in the great future.

Now, I would like to briefly report to the congress on the changes in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture over the past few years:

The Dehong Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southwestern border region of the motherland. Its original economic and cultural foundation was relatively backward. Before liberation, industrial and agricultural production was not well developed. In the early days of liberation, in 1950, the entire prefecture had only two private small factories with a total output value of about 500 yuan. In recent years, especially after the peaceful consultation on land reform, rural productive forces have been liberated, and then the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been carried out, which has further strengthened the unity between and within the various ethnic groups. All production and construction undertakings have made rapid progress. By the end of the First Five-Year Plan (the end of 1957), the entire prefecture had 46 factories and mines, including 10 processing enterprises under the grain department. As a result of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the Five-Year Plan was overfulfilled. The planned total industrial output value for 1957 is expected to be 185.8 percent of the Five-Year Plan, of which the local state-owned enterprises are expected to be 248.84 percent of the Five-Year Plan in 1957; the cooperative enterprises are expected to be 74.53 percent of the Five-Year Plan in 1957; the joint state-private enterprises completed 182.25 percent of the Five-Year Plan. Due to the arrival of the high tide of cooperation, the original private industries have all implemented joint state-private ownership. In terms of various major industrial products, electricity has completed 132.08 percent of the Five-Year Plan; raw coal 150 percent; matches 112 percent; tiles 127.29 percent; cotton cloth 163.13 percent; edible vegetable oil 203.63 percent; sugar 198.78 percent; soap 203.89 percent; and heavy leather completed 147.52 percent of the Five-Year Plan, etc. Most of the others have also completed or basically completed the Five-Year Plan, and only a very few products have not reached the Five-Year Plan target. The achievement of the above great achievements is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party, the completion of the cooperative movement, and the further strengthening of unity between and within the various ethnic groups. It also proves that as long as we unite under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can unleash greater potential and make further leaps forward in the Second Five-Year Plan period.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, agriculture also made rapid progress. The total grain output of the entire prefecture increased from more than 700 million jin in 1952 to more than 1.159 billion jin. The planting area of grain crops has also expanded by more than 100,000 mu. The peanut production among oil crops has increased by more than five and a half times compared with 1952, and rapeseed has also increased by 149.75 percent. Other economic crops such as coffee, purple stalk, and tea have also increased to varying degrees. In particular, many new economic crops have been cultivated, and the production of agricultural and sideline livestock has also increased greatly. The output of live pigs has reached more than 658,000, more than double the increase compared with 1952. Changning County in the prefecture has reached an average of one pig per person based on the population, thus exceeding the standard stipulated in the Forty Articles of Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. Other large livestock have also increased significantly. The number of buffalo alone has increased by more than 62,000 in five years. The achievement of these great achievements is inseparable from the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the beloved leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and inseparable from the vigorous assistance of the advanced ethnic groups in the motherland, especially the Han people and cadres. It is also the result of the increasingly close unity of the people and cadres of all ethnic groups in the border regions based on the continuous improvement of socialist consciousness and patriotism, and their hard work and hard work.

The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture is a place that not only has a subtropical climate, suitable for planting various food crops and cash crops, but also has abundant underground resources. According to what is now known, there are valuable mineral deposits such as saltpeter, copper, iron, placer gold, silver, mercury, lead, sulfur, semi-coke, lignite, crystal, and green bamboo stone. Recently, oil and phosphate mines have also been discovered near Tengchong and Longling. If these resources can be mined and fully utilized, it will be beneficial to our country's socialist construction and the development of the economic and cultural undertakings in the motherland's border regions. Therefore, in addition to actively exploring and developing ourselves, for relatively large-scale resources such as oil and phosphate mines, we hope that the central government and higher-level people's governments will organize exploration and development according to the needs of the country's socialist construction.

This year is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. The people of all ethnic groups in our border regions, like the people of the whole country, are enthusiastically responding to the call of the central government and are vigorously carrying out a production campaign centered on building farmland water conservancy and accumulating fertilizer. At present, there are about 160,000 laborers in the four counties working hard on water conservancy construction sites. We strive to increase agricultural production by 15 percent this year compared to last year. As for local industry, it is the same as agriculture. With the strong support of the state, we must also make a big leap forward. According to preliminary plans, in addition to expanding some existing factories and mines this year, we plan to build more than 30 new factories and mines, of which there are five larger ones in the six border counties. By the end of this year, we will be able to produce industrial products that our ancestors and ourselves never dared to think of being produced locally, such as glass, fragrant citronella oil, and maple citronella oil. In the near future, the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland's border regions will surely join hands with all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland to transition to a bright and happy socialist society. The border regions of the motherland will surely be built more beautifully.

### 把祖国的边疆建设得更美丽

    把祖国的边疆建设得更美丽
    刀京版代表介绍云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州各项事业发展的情况。他说：祖国边疆的各族人民也一定将和祖国各兄弟民族一道过渡到光明幸福的社会主义社会。
    我完全同意李先念副总理兼财政部长和薄一波副总理兼国家经济委员会主任的两个报告。在两个报告中，都指出了去年国家财政收支计划的超额完成，不但有力地保证了第一个五年计划最后一年的胜利完成，而且为第二个五年计划准备了良好的基础，使我们对于伟大的未来，更加充满了信心。
    现在我仅就德宏傣族景颇族自治州几年来的变化向大会简单的汇报一下：
    德宏自治州是在祖国的西南边疆，原来的经济、文化基础都比较落后，在解放前，工农业生产都不大发展，解放初期的一九五○年，全州只有产值共五百元左右的二家私营小工厂。这几年来，特别是经过了和平协商土地改革以后，解放了农村生产力，并接着开展互助合作运动，进一步加强了各民族之间和民族内部的团结，各项生产建设事业都有了飞跃的进展。至第一个五年计划末期（一九五七年底），全州已有厂矿企业四十六个，其中粮食部门所属加工企业十个。第一个五年计划执行的结果，超额完成了五年计划。工业总产值计划一九五七年预计为五年计划的百分之一百八十五点八，其中，地方国营一九五七年预计为五年计划的百分之二百四十八点八四；合作社营一九五七年预计为五年计划的百分之七十四点五三；公私合营完成了五年计划的百分之一百八十二点二五。由于合作化高潮的到来，原来的私营工业都实行公私合营。在各种主要工业产品方面，电力完成了五年计划数的百分之一百三十二点零八；原煤百分之一百五十；火柴百分之一百一十二；瓦百分之一百二十七点二九；棉布百分之一百六十三点一三；食用植物油百分之二百零三点六三；糖百分之一百九十八点七八；肥皂百分之二百零三点八九；重革完成了五年计划的百分之一百四十七点五二等等，其他也多数都完成或者基本上完成了五年计划，只有极个别的产品没有达到五年计划指标。以上伟大成就的取得，是同共产党的领导，合作化运动的完成，以及各民族间和各民族内部进一步加强了团结是分不开的。同时也证明了，只要在共产党领导下团结一致，是可以发挥更大的潜力，在第二个五年计划期内，进一步地向前飞跃发展。
    第一个五年计划期间，在农业方面，也有飞跃的进展。全州的粮食总产量，从一九五二年的七亿多斤增加到十一亿五千九百多万斤，粮食的播种面积也扩大十万多亩，油料作物中的花生比一九五二年增长五倍半多，油菜也增长百分之一百四十九点七五，其他经济作物如咖啡、紫梗、茶叶等都有不同程度的增长，特别是新栽培了不少的经济作物，农副业牲畜也增长很大，生猪的产量已达到六十五万八千多口，比一九五二年增加一倍还多，州内的昌宁县按人口计算已达到每人平均养一口猪，这样就提前超过了农业发展四十条纲要（修正草案）所规定的标准。其他大牲畜也有很大增加，单水牛在五年中就增长了六万二千多头。以上这些巨大成就的取得都是与伟大的中国共产党和各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席的正确领导分不开的，是与祖国的先进民族，特别是汉族人民和干部的大力帮助分不开的，也是由于边疆各族人民和干部在不断地提高社会主义觉悟和爱国主义觉悟的基础上日益亲密团结，努力生产、努力工作的结果。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州，是一个不但有亚热带气候，适宜于栽种各种粮食作物和经济作物的地方，而且地下蕴藏也很丰富，据现在已经知道的有硝、铜、铁、淘金、银、汞、铅、硫磺、半焦煤、木煤、水晶石、绿竹石等等宝贵矿藏，最近在腾冲和龙陵附近还发现有石油苗和磷矿，这些资源若能开采出来，充分利用，对于我国的社会主义建设，和发展祖国边疆的经济、文化事业，都将有益处的。因此，除了我们自己积极勘探和开发外，对于规模比较大的资源如石油、磷矿等，希望中央和上级人民政府根据国家社会主义建设的需要情况，组织勘探和开发。
    今年是第二个五年计划的第一年，我们边疆各族人民也和全国人民一样，热烈响应中央的号召，正在热火朝天地开展以兴修农田水利和积肥为中心的生产运动，目前只内四县就有约十六万个劳动力在水利工地上大力兴修水利，我们争取今年农业生产比去年增加百分之一十五。而在地方工业方面，也和农业一样。在国家的大力扶持下，也要大大跃进一步，据初步计划今年除了扩建一些原有厂矿外，准备再新建三十多个工厂和矿山，其中规模较大的在边沿六县就有五个。到今年年底，我们就可出产从前我们的祖先和我们自己所不敢想到由本地出产的工业产品，如玻璃、芬香原料的香茅油、枫茅油等等。而在不久的将来，祖国的边疆全族人民也一定将会和祖国各兄弟民族一道过渡到光明幸福的社会主义社会。祖国的边疆一定建设得更美满。
