Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th: As the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army (February 8th) approaches, people in various parts of Korea are spreading stories of the People's Army helping the people in production and construction. People say that the People's Army is not only a strong defender of peace and socialist cause but also an active builder of the socialist cause.

The people of Songrim City call the People's Army unit led by Lieutenant Colonel Hong Hyu-pyo "Songrim City Builders." The People's Army soldiers of the Hong Hyu-pyo unit not only participated in the restoration and construction of the Hwanghae Iron Works but also helped the local people build schools and residences. In the past year, the soldiers of this unit built more than 33,000 square meters of houses and dormitories, as well as a two-story nursery, a department store with a construction area of more than 2,300 square meters, two public bathhouses, a corn flour mill, and a school.

Model soldier Lee Jong-ho received a short vacation reward and returned to his hometown of Seoheung-ri, Oncheon County, South Pyongan Province. The youths of his hometown were mobilizing to participate in the construction of the Gihyang Irrigation Project. Lee Jong-ho immediately decided to join the labor with the youths of his hometown during his vacation. Inspired by Lee Jong-ho, the youths of Oncheon County exceeded their work tasks by an average of 40% every day. The Seoheung-ri Youth Team was rated as the first place in the labor competition.

The People's Army unit led by Major Jeong Dong-jin often helped agricultural cooperative members with their work from spring rice planting to autumn harvest. Just as the members were celebrating the harvest, the tide rose, and the members' labor achievements of the year were about to be flooded. The soldiers rushed to help the members rescue the rice. After four hours of intense labor, they finally rescued all of the more than 7,300 bundles of rice. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜人民军积极参加建设
    新华社平壤7日电　在朝鲜人民军建军十周年（2月8日）即将到来的时候，朝鲜各地人民传颂着人民军帮助人民进行生产建设的事迹。人们说，人民军不仅是和平和社会主义事业的坚强的保卫者，而且是社会主义事业的积极建设者。
    松林市人民把洪休杓中校率领的人民军部队称作“松林市建设者”。洪休杓部队的人民军战士不仅参加了黄海制铁所的恢复建设工作，还帮助驻地人民建设学校和住宅。去年一年内，这支部队的战士一共建筑了三万三千多平方公尺的住宅和宿舍，此外还建筑了一间两层楼的托儿所、一座建筑面积达两千三百多平方公尺的百货商店、两所公共澡堂、一座玉蜀黍制粉厂和一所学校。
    模范战士李宗浩得到短期休假的奖励回到家乡平安南道温泉郡瑞和里休假时，家乡的青年正在动员起来参加建设岐阳灌溉工程。李宗浩立即决定在假期内和家乡的青年一起去参加劳动。在李宗浩的鼓舞下，温泉郡的青年每天平均超额40％完成工作任务。瑞和里青年队在劳动竞赛中被评为第一名。
    郑东镇少校率领的人民军部队从去年春天插秧直到秋收，经常帮助农业社社员干活。正当社员们庆祝丰收的时候，潮水上涨，社员们一年来的劳动果实眼看就要被水淹没，战士们又争先恐后地帮助社员抢救稻子，经过四小时的紧张劳动，终于把七千三百多束稻子全部抢救出来。（附图片）
