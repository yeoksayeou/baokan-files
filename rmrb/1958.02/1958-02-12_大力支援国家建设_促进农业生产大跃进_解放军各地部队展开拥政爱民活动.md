Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Chinese People's Liberation Army units stationed throughout the country have recently begun their Spring Festival "Support the Government and Cherish the People" activities, focusing on vigorously supporting national construction, promoting a great leap forward in agricultural production, and further strengthening military-government and military-civilian relations.

In recent days, from the bitter cold of the Northeast to the early spring of Jiangnan, garrisons in various regions have organized large labor forces to support rural and urban construction. During the "Support the Government and Cherish the People" month, a certain PLA unit stationed in Beijing will contribute a total of 30,000 workdays to support suburban agricultural cooperatives in developing production. A certain unit stipulated that before the Spring Festival, each member should accumulate an average of 120 catties of fertilizer and send it to agricultural cooperatives as a festive gift. During the "Support the Government and Cherish the People" month, some units will also allocate manpower to assist local people in running winter schools, carrying out winter mass sports activities, and cooperating with local people in doing a good job in "eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene." Many units stationed in cities have inquired in advance with local relevant departments about the supply of goods during the festival and have decided not to buy or buy less of some New Year goods that are in short supply on the market. Troops stationed in the Lushun-Dalian area have decided to allocate a batch of manpower, vehicles, and ships during the Spring Festival to assist local transportation departments in transferring New Year goods and transporting passengers.

In addition, garrisons in various regions have recently summarized their "Support the Government and Cherish the People" work from the past year and are preparing to report to local Party and government organs and relevant departments. Many units are also preparing to hold military-government and military-civilian forums to continue to listen to criticisms and opinions from government agencies and the people. The Shenyang Military Region has also decided to thoroughly inspect military land use during the Spring Festival and hand over unnecessary and temporarily unused portions to agricultural cooperatives for cultivation as soon as possible.

Many units have decided to invite cadres from local Party and government organs and representatives from all walks of life to report to the officers and soldiers on the country's socialist construction, visit the troops' regularization and modernization construction, and view military technical performances before and after the festival. At the same time, the troops are also preparing to organize officers and soldiers to visit local factories and agricultural cooperatives and report on their activities in defending the motherland to people from all walks of life before and after the festival. During the festival, the cultural troupes, soldiers' amateur performing teams, and film projection teams of various troops will specially perform congratulatory performances and screen films for people from all walks of life.

    解放军各地部队展开拥政爱民活动
    新华社11日讯　中国人民解放军驻全国各地部队以大力支援国家建设、促进农业生产大跃进和进一步密切军政、军民关系为主要内容的春节“拥政爱民”活动，已经在最近陆续开始。
    连日来，从严寒的东北到早春的江南，各地驻军都组织了劳动大军支援农村和城市建设。北京驻军某部在“拥政爱民”月期间将共以三万个人工支援郊区农业社发展生产。某部规定所属人员春节前平均每人要积攒一百二十斤肥料送给农业社作为节日的礼物。在“拥政爱民”月期间，有些部队还将抽出人力协助当地人民举办冬学，开展冬季的群众体育活动和配合当地人民做好“除四害、讲卫生”等工作。不少驻在城市的部队，都事先向当地有关部门了解节日期间的物资供应情况，对一些市场上供应量较少的年货，确定不买或少买。驻旅大地区的部队决定春节期间抽出一批人力、车辆和船只，协助当地交通部门转运年货和运送旅客。
    此外，各地驻军都在最近总结了去年的“拥政爱民”工作，准备向当地党政机关和有关部门进行汇报。不少部队还准备召开军政、军民座谈会，继续听取政府机关和人民群众的批评意见。沈阳部队并且决定春节期间彻底清查一次军事用地，尽量把不必要的和暂时用不上的部分早日交农业社耕种。
    很多单位决定在节日前后，邀请当地党政机关的干部和各界人民的代表向部队官兵报告国家社会主义建设情况，参观部队的正规化、现代化建设和军事技术表演。同时，部队也准备在节日前后组织军官、士兵参观访问当地的工厂、农业社，并且向各界人民汇报自己保卫祖国的活动。各部队的文工团、战士业余演出队和电影放映队，节日期间将专门为各界人民进行祝贺演出和放映电影。
