Having listened to the reports of Vice Premiers Bo Yibo and Li Xiannian of the State Council, I fully endorse them and am determined to resolutely implement them in my future work. Now I will report to the conference on the lessons learned in production and the current situation of the Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinning County, Yunnan.

In the past, Jinning was a low-yield county, and Shangsuan was an even poorer place, where harvests failed two years out of three and even maggots wouldn't grow in the latrines. People usually didn't have enough water to drink, and in the rainy season, “you could catch fish in the potholes.” Most people didn't have enough to eat or wear. Since the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, production has developed year by year. In the past, the best land of wealthy middle peasants only yielded 370 jin per mu. Last year, the entire cooperative's 8,300 mu of land averaged 551 jin of rice per mu. The total value of grain production increased by 80% compared to 1952, and the total value of agricultural and sideline production increased by two and a half times compared to 1952. The production and living standards of the entire cooperative have already exceeded those of the local wealthy middle peasants. However, even so, we are still very dissatisfied, because we originally planned to increase production by more than 20% in 1957 compared to 1956, but grain production only increased by half a percent, and the collective's total income actually decreased compared to 1956. What was the cause of this? It’s infuriating to talk about.

	Defeated the Rightists’ Attack, Achieved Victory in the Two-Line Struggle

Last spring, when everyone was happy and actively responding to the Central Committee's call to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957 by all possible means, an evil wind came. Rightists colluded with landlords and rich peasants in the countryside to attack the Party and socialism. Some wealthy middle peasants also stirred up trouble, creating a chaotic atmosphere, and even some poor and lower-middle peasants were affected. We were vigilant against landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. We struggled against them as soon as they made a move. We were also not very complacent about those who used to ride on the backs of the people, were treated leniently by the people after liberation, became high officials but still wanted to oppose the Party and socialism, as well as those intellectuals who were nurtured by the bourgeoisie. They wanted to use the Communist Party's rectification campaign to carry out sabotage. Our province had a vice governor named Gong Zizhi, who openly slandered that "cooperatives starve people" and "the three fixings are bad." I then refuted him in a talk published in the Yunnan Daily based on the facts of Shangsuan. But when the county party secretary found out about this, he gave me a good scolding. He didn’t allow us to oppose the rightists, or to struggle against counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and rich peasants. He said that all of this was a contradiction among the people, that all contradictions among the people were because socialism was being done too vigorously, and that the Communist Party should be responsible. He was a college student from a bourgeois background. Not only could he spout a set of fallacies, but he was also very good at attacking people. He everywhere scolded me and those comrades who insisted on the three-fix policy and said that the cooperative had great achievements as "having no mass viewpoint" and "having no party spirit." He didn't allow us to engage in thousand-jin cooperatives or thousand-jin teams. He said that all advanced production increase plans were bragging. He attacked all advanced measures and even called for dismantling the cooperatives. While this fellow desperately attacked us, he also distributed a large amount of state grain to the members according to work points. The county issued several million jin one after another. This confused everyone's thinking. Although I was very dissatisfied with him speaking on the side of the enemy, he was all-powerful at the time. We couldn't immediately recognize his reactionary face, and we couldn't distinguish between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and internal contradictions. We couldn't find a way to resolve the contradictions. At the same time, I also had peasant thoughts. When the work didn’t go smoothly, I thought that letting the peasants have more grain in their hands might save trouble. As a result, I fell for the trick of this rightist in the Party. The more grain that was taken down, the more capitalism raised its head, the harder the work became, and production suffered serious losses. This lesson was really too profound.

Since we launched a mass rectification movement in August last year, using the magic weapon of large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions taught by Chairman Mao, we gradually clarified the major issues of right and wrong. The vast number of members and cadres received a very profound education, which made me realize that the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism not only existed in the past but will continue to exist in the future; not only exists in society but also within the Party; not only exists on the issue of grain but also on the issue of production and cooperative management. In the future, only by constantly arming ourselves and educating the masses with socialist ideology can the cooperative develop and be consolidated, and production can make a great leap forward.

In the past, I thought that once the ownership system was changed, and everyone had joined the advanced cooperative, things would probably go very smoothly afterward. Facts have proved that my thinking was too naive. Rightists and enemies in the countryside will sabotage whenever they have the opportunity, not to mention that. Even within the peasantry, the ideological struggle between the two roads has not been completely resolved. For example, we had just clarified the major issues of right and wrong on the grain issue. As soon as we entered the rectification of the cooperative and the Party and discussed the Forty Articles, problems arose again. Some wealthy middle peasants always disagreed with strictly developing production and consolidating the cooperative in the socialist direction, always emphasizing "adapting to local conditions" first, not emphasizing the implementation of the state production plan first; always wanting to have more private plots and contribute less labor and fertilizer to the cooperative; the poor and lower-middle peasants advocated that production should make a great leap forward every year, and put forward very good production increase measures and targets, and they satirized, saying "the baby's wife, talking about it hangs in the air." Some use the perspective of individual peasants to view collective production, saying "things that cannot be done in dozens of lifetimes, I don't believe they can be done now," unwilling to expand the replanting area, unwilling to plant seedlings in the seedling fields, saying: "Rather eat thin porridge, don't plant seedling rice." This struggle between capitalism and socialism, between the advanced and the conservative, is very prominent in production issues and the management of cooperatives.

	Through Airing Views, Mass Consciousness Increased, Must Make Barren Mountains Bow Their Heads and Land Overturn

However, in the large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions, due to adhering to believing in the majority and firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, all incorrect thoughts were finally criticized by the masses. During the rectification of the cooperative and the Party, the masses put forward more than 2,000 criticisms to the Party branch and the cooperative management committee. The vast majority of these opinions were correct, especially those put forward by the poor and lower-middle peasants. They wholeheartedly supported socialism, fearing that the locomotive of the cooperative management committee and the Party branch would not have enough energy and would be weak in the struggle against capitalism. The criticisms were very sharp. They also raised many opinions on the unsound management system of the cooperative, unclear responsibilities, and the bad work style of some cadres. We have fiercely corrected all these correct opinions in the process of rectification. The incorrect and wrong opinions were handed over to the masses for debate, especially clarifying the reasons why the production increase plan was not completed, which further educated the cadres and the masses, and socialist enthusiasm became increasingly high. The tasks of autumn harvest, autumn planting, and grain storage were completed a month earlier, and saving grain became the fashion. When a wealthy middle peasant only said "there are not many grains of rations left," he was immediately surrounded and criticized by the masses, and his grain consumption was calculated. Especially in water conservancy construction, last year it was "the government builds reservoirs, the masses come to help," "the government builds ponds, the masses come to help," and each worker received five to seven jiao and more than a jin of rice from the government every day, but many people still played truant. This year, the project is larger than last year. Not only does the government not need to give money, but the entire ration is brought by themselves, and they are rushing to do it day and night. Now, the production enthusiasm of the members is extremely high! The slogans "Make barren mountains bow their heads," "Make the land overturn," "Split the high mountains in half and let the river pass through the high mountains," "Don't repair water conservancy well and don't pass the old age," "Don't accumulate 80% of the spring fertilizer and don't pass the old age" have become mass actions. The entire cooperative, except for a few people who are seriously ill or giving birth, including the five-guarantee households, have all moved, and the attendance rate has reached 97%. Every day when the cock crows for the first time, there are shouts and horse neighs in the village, and the fields and ditches are full of people working; it is dark and still doing work with gasoline lamps. By the time I came to the meeting, more than 1,000 workers, in less than two months, had completed 95% of the 120,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Fertilizer accumulation is also close to the target, and because there was a debate on the compost problem, the method was improved, the processing was meticulous, and there were professional groups, and the inspection and acceptance were strict, the quality and quantity of fertilizer were doubled compared to last year.

Formulate This Year's Production Targets to Welcome Competition

Mu Yield of 800 Jin, Total Value of Agricultural and Sideline Production More Than Doubled

Nine Pigs Per Household, 300 Work Days Per Labor Force

We are now launching a socialist production competition with all the fraternal cooperatives in the county and the province. Our main production increase targets for 1958 are: the unit area yield of grain should reach the requirement of 800 jin stipulated in the Forty Articles this year, the total grain output should increase by 56% compared with last year, and the total value of agricultural and sideline production should increase by 1.02 times. Proposing this indicator is completely based on and guaranteed. In fact, the planned targets of most production teams are even higher. The main measures to complete this indicator are water conservancy, fertilizer, and various technical processing. It is already certain that water conservancy can be completed ahead of schedule before the Spring Festival. In addition to ensuring the irrigation of the original 8,000 mu of land, it can also expand the land by more than 2,700 mu. In terms of fertilization, the average fine fertilizer per mu of land is 39 loads, miscellaneous fertilizer is 14 loads, and phosphorus ore powder is 150 jin, which can also be accumulated and added well in advance. The average number of pigs raised per household is 9.1, and we already had 8 last year, which is estimated to be greatly exceeded. The average number of work days per man and woman labor force is 300 days per year, more than 8 hours per day. As long as we maintain the enthusiasm of winter production, we can greatly exceed it. Great progress has been made in improving labor organization and leadership methods, and we must continue to do so. This year, we plan to sell 1.2 million jin of grain to the state in addition to completing the three-fix purchase task; the cooperative will retain 600,000 jin of grain (by next year we will have enough grain reserves for the entire cooperative to eat for a year), so that everyone can also be allocated 700 jin of grain. Our biggest weakness now is that technical reforms cannot keep up. For example, although the existing seeders, double-wheel double-share plows, oxcarts, and horse-drawn carts have all been used, they are still too few. We want to strive to overfulfill the 1958 plan and realize the other requirements of the Forty Articles ahead of schedule during the second five-year plan period. We are now desperately carrying out technical reforms, criticizing conservative thinking, and opening fire on nature. The members now have this requirement, and some of our female members have already carried more than 110 kilograms. It is not enough to simply emphasize increasing labor intensity. But on the other hand, one-third of the cattle and horses in the cooperative have not been used to replace manpower because of the lack of oxcarts and saddles, and there are very few handcarts. This alone shows how much technical reform needs to be done. As long as the transportation tools are further resolved, we can save at least nearly a thousand people every day to do other work. In terms of selecting good varieties of crops, artificial insemination and breeding of good breeds of livestock, developing fruit trees, eliminating the four pests, and cadres starting to engage in experimental fields and experimental plots, although we have made some achievements in the past few years, we are still very backward compared to other advanced regions. We have the determination and confidence to work hard to catch up in this regard. Our conditions are good, and the consciousness of the masses is high. As long as the leadership no longer lags behind reality, we will definitely be able to do things that people have not been able to do for thousands of years. Another example is birth control. Recently, we calculated that during the first five-year plan, the net increase in the population of the entire cooperative was 1,271, accounting for 28% of the original population of the entire cooperative. After the members understood the principle of family planning, six members with many children went to the hospital to tie their vas deferens within two days, and others bought more than 380 condoms.

Our cooperative decided to invest another 46,000 yuan to the county to repair other water conservancy projects, and invest 30,000 yuan to the tractor station to buy tractors. We know that accelerating the construction of socialism requires the joint efforts of all cooperatives. We believe that as long as all our working peasants continue to listen to the Party, unite on the basis of socialist ideology, constantly learn from the working class, seek the help of scientific and technical personnel, and under the leadership of the working class, all difficulties will bow to us, the Forty Articles will definitely be realized ahead of schedule, industrialization and agricultural modernization will definitely be completed ahead of schedule, and we will definitely be able to catch up with Britain in fifteen years.

### 一切困难都得向我们低头  李能代表介绍晋宁县上蒜农业社的生产建设

　　一切困难都得向我们低头
    李能代表介绍晋宁县上蒜农业社的生产建设
    听了国务院薄一波、李先念两位副总理的报告，我完全拥护，并且一定要在今后的工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我把云南晋宁县上蒜农业生产合作社去年生产上的教训和现在的情况，向大会汇报。
    过去晋宁是一个低产县，上蒜更是个三年两不收，痾屎不生蛆的穷地方，平时没有水吃，雨季“锅洞可以拿鱼”，多数人没得吃，没得穿。自从有了党和毛主席的英明领导，生产逐年发展。过去富裕中农最好的田，每亩才收三百七十斤，去年全社八千三百亩田，每亩单是稻谷平均就收五百五十一斤，粮食总产值比一九五二年增加百分之八十，农副业总产值比一九五二年增加两倍半，全社的生产和生活水平已经超过了当地的裕富中农。但是，虽然这样，我们还是很不满意，因为我们原来计划一九五七年是要比一九五六年增产二成以上的，结果粮食只增产半成，集体的总收入倒反比一九五六年减少，这是什么鬼原因？说起来真把人气坏了。
　　打退了右派分子的进攻  取得两条路线斗争的胜利
    去年春天，大家正在很高兴，积极行动起来响应中央号召的千方百计争取一九五七年大丰收的时候，来了一股歪风，右派分子和农村的地主、富农勾结起来向党和社会主义进攻，一部分富裕中农也闹起来，搞的乌烟瘴气，连一部分贫农、下中农也受到了影响。我们对地主、富农、反革命分子是有警惕的，他们一动我们就斗争，对那些过去骑在人民头上、解放后受到人民宽待、做了大官还要反党反社会主义的人，还有那些受资产阶级喂大的知识分子，他们要利用共产党的整风来搞破坏活动，我们也不是很麻痹的。我们省有个副省长叫做龚自知的，公开诬蔑说“合作化饿死人”，“三定不好”，我当时就根据上蒜的事实，向云南日报发表谈话反驳他。可是这事被县委书记知道了，他把我臭骂了一气。还不准我们反对右派，不准斗争反革命分子和地主富农。他说这一切都是人民内部矛盾，说凡是人民内部有矛盾都是因为社会主义搞得太猛，都要由共产党负责，他是个资产阶级出身的大学生。不但会讲一套歪道理，还很会打击人。他到处骂我和那些坚持三定政策、说合作化成绩大的同志是“没有群众观点”，“没有党性”，不准我们搞千斤社千斤队，他说所有的先进增产计划都是吹牛，他打击一切先进措施，并且还叫拆散合作社。这家伙一面拼命打击我们，一面又把国家的大批粮食按工分分给社员，全县先后发了几百万斤。这样就把大家的思想搞得非常混乱。我虽然很不满意他站在敌人方面说话，但是当时他一手遮天，我们一下子认不清他的反动面目，而且也分不清什么是敌我矛盾，什么是内部矛盾，找不着解决矛盾的办法；同时我还有农民思想，在工作搞不开的时候，也曾经认为让农民手里多有点粮食可能省事些。结果是上了党内这个右派分子的鬼当，粮食越往下拿，资本主义越抬头，工作越难做，生产受到严重损失，这个教训实在太深刻了。
    我们从去年八月开展全民整风运动，运用了毛主席教导的大鸣大放大辩论的法宝，逐步把大是大非搞清楚了，广大社员和干部都受到非常深刻的教育，使我认识到社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，不但过去有，今后还会有；不但社会上有，在党内也有；不但在粮食问题上有，在生产和合作社的管理问题上也有。今后只有时时刻刻用社会主义思想来武装自己和教育群众，社才能发展、巩固，生产才能大跃进。
    过去我以为所有制改变，什么人都入了高级社了，以后的事情大概会很顺利了。事实证明我的思想太幼稚。右派分子和农村里的敌人一有机会就要破坏，这且不说它。就说农民内部，思想上的两条道路的斗争其实也还没有完全解决。比如我们刚把粮食问题上的大是大非辩论清楚，一进入整社整党和讨论四十条纲要，问题又来了。有的富裕中农总是不赞成严格按照社会主义方向来发展生产和巩固合作社，总是首先强调“因地制宜”，不首先强调执行国家生产计划；总想多搞点自留地，少给合作社出工和投肥料；贫农、下中农主张生产应该年年大跃进，提出很好的增产措施和指标，他们就讽刺，说是“娃娃的媳妇，说了挂着”。有的是用个体农民的观点来看集体生产，说什么“几十辈子干不成的事，不信现在就干得成”，不愿扩大复种面积，秧田不愿栽秧，说：“宁吃稀粥粥，莫栽秧田谷”。这种资本主义同社会主义、先进同保守的斗争，在生产问题和合作社的经营管理问题上表现得非常突出。
　　通过鸣放群众觉悟提高了  要让荒山低头叫土地翻身
    但是在大鸣大放大辩论中，由于坚持了相信多数，坚决依靠贫农、下中农，所有不正确的思想最后都给群众批判下去了。整社整党中群众给党支部和社管会提了两千多条批评意见。这些意见，绝大多数是正确的，特别是贫农、下中农提的。他们衷心拥护社会主义，生怕社管会和党支部这个火车头劲头不足，同资本主义斗争软弱无力，批评非常尖锐。对社的管理制度不健全，责任不明，有的干部作风不好，也提出不少意见。所有这些正确意见，我们都在边整边改中狠狠改了。意见中有不正确的和错误的，交给群众去辩论，特别是辩清了增产计划没有完成的原因，更加教育了干部和群众，社会主义积极性就越来越高涨了。秋收、秋种和粮食入仓任务提早一个月完成，节约用粮成了风气，有一个富裕中农才说一句“口粮没有几颗了”，马上就被群众围住批评，算他的用粮账。特别是兴修水利，去年是“政府修水库，群众来帮助”，“政府修水塘，群众来帮忙”，每天每个工从政府拿到五至七角钱和一斤多大米，结果还有许多人开小差。今年工程比去年大，不仅不要政府给钱，口粮全部自带，而且是争先恐后，白日黑夜的干。现在，社员们的生产劲头大极啦！“叫荒山低头”，“叫土地翻身”，“把高山劈成两半，叫河水穿过高山”，“不修好水利不过老年”，“不积足大春肥料百分之八十，不过老年”的口号已经变成群众性的行动。全社除个别害重病、生娃娃的人外，连五保户在内都动起来了，出勤率达到百分之九十七。每天鸡叫头遍，村子里就人喊马叫，田里、沟里尽是做活的人；天大黑还点着汽灯马灯干。到我来开会时一千多个工，还不到两个月，已完成了十二万土方任务的百分之九十五。积肥也接近指标，而且因为在堆肥问题上进行了辩论，改进了方法，加工细致，又有专业组，检查验收严格，肥料质量数量都比去年提高一倍。
    订出今年生产指标欢迎竞赛
    亩产八百斤，农副业总产值增加一倍多
    每户养猪九头，每个劳动力出勤三百天
    我们现在正在和全县和全省各兄弟社展开社会主义生产大竞赛。我们一九五八年的主要增产指标是：粮食的单位面积产量要在今年达到四十条纲要规定的八百斤的要求，粮食总产比去年增五成六，农副业总产值增一点零二倍。提出这个指标是完全有根据和有保证的。实际上多数生产队的计划指标比这还高。完成这个指标的主要措施是水利、肥料和各种技术加工。水利已经肯定了在春节以前就能提早完成任务，除了保证原有八千多亩田的灌溉外，还可以再扩大田地二千七百多亩。施肥方面，田和地每亩平均细肥三十九挑，杂肥十四挑和磷矿粉一百五十斤，这些也能提早积足和加好工。养猪每户平均九点一头，我们去年已经有八头估计可以大大超过。男女劳动力平均每年每人出勤三百天，每天八小时以上，只要保持冬季生产这种劲头，可以大大超过。改进劳动组织和改进领导方法已经有很大进步，还要继续进行。今年我们计划完成三定征购任务之外，多卖一百二十万斤粮食给国家；社留储粮六十万斤（到明年我们就可以有足够全社一年吃用的储粮），这样每人还可以分到七百斤粮食。我们现在最大的弱点是技术改革还跟不上，例如播种机、双轮双铧犁，牛车、马车等，虽然现有的都已全部用上了，但是还太少。我们要争取超额完成一九五八年计划和提前在第二个五年计划期间实现四十条纲要的其他要求，现在正在拼命进行技术改革，批判守旧思想，向大自然开火。社员们现在都有这个要求，我们的女社员有的已背到一百一十多公斤，单单强调提高劳动强度已经不够了。但是另方面社里还有三分之一的牛和马，因为缺少牛车、马鞍，还没有用来代替人力，手推车也很少。单是这件事就可以看出技术改革有多少事情等着办的。只要把运输工具进一步解决了，我们每天至少就可以节约出将近一千个人来干其他活计。我们在选用农作物优良品种、牲畜人工授精和繁殖良种、发展果树、除四害、干部动手搞试验田试验地等方面，几年来虽然有些成绩，但是比起其他先进地区来，还很落后。我们有决心有信心在这方面努力赶上。我们的条件是好的，群众觉悟是高的，只要领导不再老是落后于实际，几千年来人们都做不到的事情我们一定都能做出来。又如节育，最近我们算了一算，第一个五年计划全社净增人口一千二百七十一人，占全社原有人口的百分之二十八。社员一懂得计划生育的道理以后，两天内就有六个儿女多的社员去卫生院把输精管扎了，其他的人还买了避孕套三百八十多个。
    我们社决定再投资四万六千元给县上修其他水利，投资三万元给拖拉机站买拖拉机。我们晓得要加快建设社会主义是要所有的合作社都一起努力才行。我们相信只要我们全体劳动农民继续听党的话，在社会主义思想基础上团结一致，不断地虚心向工人老大哥学习，争取科学技术人员的帮助，在工人阶级领导下，一切困难都会向我们低头，四十条一定能够提前实现，工业化和农业现代化一定能够提前完成，十五年一定能够赶上英国。
