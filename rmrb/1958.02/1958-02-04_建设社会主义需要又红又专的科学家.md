　　Building Socialism Requires Scientists Who Are Both Red and Expert
　　Tian Fu
    To build our country into a strong socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in about fifteen years, we must have highly developed natural sciences and social sciences. Since liberation, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, China's scientific undertakings have greatly developed. The scientific team has expanded twenty times, many new technologies and blank scientific departments have been established and strengthened, and the weak and backward state of the scientific foundation is rapidly changing. However, the quantity and quality of existing scientific cadres are still far from meeting the needs of China's socialist construction and development.
    As Stalin said, socialist construction "requires whole batches of hundreds and thousands of Bolshevik experts who are proficient in one of the various branches of knowledge. Without this, there is no need to talk about the rapid speed of our socialist construction. Without this, there is no need to talk about us catching up with and surpassing the advanced capitalist countries.” [Note 1] However, the basic situation of China's current scientific team is: there are still very few red experts; most experts are expert but not red; many party member cadres are red but not expert; many young scientific workers are not "reddening while becoming expert," but "becoming expert first and then reddening" or "only expert but not red." The formation of this situation has its historical roots. In old China, the children of the working people had very few opportunities to go to university, and only the children of bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists had the opportunity to receive higher education. Intellectuals from exploiting class families and who have been influenced deeply by bourgeois education, are naturally deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, among the existing experts, only a very small number are "both red and expert" scientists. The current party member cadres generally lack natural science knowledge. After participating in the revolution, these comrades were in a tense war environment for a long time and had very little time to study science and technology. These are the historical reasons why our country currently lacks experts who are both red and expert.
    The current situation is fundamentally different from that of old China. With the changes in the social system and the reform of the education system, China's educational institutions now belong to the working people and serve the vast working people. They are educational institutions "to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and good health." [Note 2] In the early days of the founding of the country, the Party put forward the policy that universities must open their doors to workers and peasants, so that worker and peasant cadres, working people, and the children of working people, have the opportunity to learn cultural and scientific knowledge. The Party not only attaches importance to directly training intellectuals of the working class from workers and peasants; it also always attaches importance to uniting, educating, and transforming the old intellectuals. Chairman Mao said: "We hope that China's intellectuals will continue to move forward, gradually establish a communist world outlook in the process of their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism, and gradually integrate with workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone retreat, there is no way out for retreat." [Note 3] In fact, many intellectuals are following Chairman Mao's teachings, studying Marxism-Leninism diligently under the education and help of Party organizations, and consciously carrying out ideological transformation. Some of them have become red experts.
    Cultivating red experts and establishing a scientific team of the working class is the historical task of our entire Party and the people of the whole country. Scientific workers and Party member cadres working in scientific research institutions must first take responsibility for realizing this task. How to undertake this major and glorious historical task? That is, according to their different situations, they must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, connect with reality, transform their thinking; conscientiously study scientific work, master scientific knowledge, and train themselves to become red experts with Marxist-Leninist thought who can independently conduct creative scientific research.
    To achieve this goal, the problems faced by scientists and Party member cadres working in scientific institutions, as well as young scientific workers, are different.
    Scientists are the main component of the scientific team and an important force in scientific research work. Most of them have a high academic level, are proficient in their own field, and can independently carry out scientific research work. They have a considerable understanding of the Party's emphasis on scientists and concern for scientific research work, and creating favorable conditions for the development of scientific research work in all aspects. The absolute majority of scientists are willing to accept the leadership of the Party, make some achievements in scientific research work, and contribute to the country. However, since they came from the old society, they are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology; after liberation, although they have been improved through various political movements and ideological transformations, many people still have bourgeois idealism and individualism to varying degrees due to the different degrees of personal awareness and the speed of progress. The idealist views of scientists in academic thought are mainly manifested in not recognizing that the most fundamental source of knowledge is human productive practice and the practice of class struggle, but thinking that it is abstract thinking. Under the guidance of this thought, some people do not combine the research topics they choose with China's specific conditions and the needs of socialist construction, but look for loopholes in books and literature. If the selected topic is to theoretically explain or explore a certain scientific law, it is of course possible, and even necessary; however, some people do not consider theoretical value or economic value, but only want to write papers as soon as possible to hunt for fame and fortune. Some people treat scientific research work plans with an attitude of individualism and liberalism. In their opinion, "making plans is only to cope with superiors," so the plan is set so that "outsiders nod when they see it, and insiders can't figure it out." Many scientists also lack collectivist ideas, or have not learned the method of collective work. When they are engaged in scientific research work, they are each minding their own business, "working independently in a collective," and "not cooperating with each other," causing unnecessary repetition of some research topics, and seriously wasting manpower and material resources. General scientists, especially natural scientists, mostly have a tendency to varying degrees to ignore politics, are unwilling to study Marxism-Leninism, are unwilling to participate in social activities, and cannot consciously and earnestly carry out self-ideological transformation. It is precisely because many scientists are not strict with themselves politically and their bourgeois ideology has not been thoroughly transformed, that when right-wing elements launched a rampant attack, they lost their way and resonated with the right-wing elements in their thoughts and feelings. Some people even degenerated into right-wing elements. Therefore, patriotic scientists, if they want to give full play to their talents, make achievements in scientific research work, and serve the socialist construction of the motherland, must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism. In learning, they must closely connect with their own ideological reality and work reality, use theory as a weapon to examine their own thinking, criticize bourgeois idealism and individualism, abandon the bourgeois world outlook, and gradually establish a communist world outlook. Only a transformation from thoughts and feelings to viewpoints and positions can enable them to effectively serve the socialist construction of the motherland; and follow the practice of their work to further understand socialism and recognize socialism. Old intellectuals have always come under the ideological guidance of "all other professions are inferior, only studying is superior." They generally have the idea of despising physical labor and are incompatible with the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Therefore, to be transformed into intellectuals of the working class, they must accept the training of collectivism, the training of physical labor, go deep into factories and rural areas to participate in physical labor, and solve the relationship between individuals and collectives, and the combination of mental and physical laborers from practice. Our scientific cause is for socialism. The idea of "science for the sake of science" has long been criticized. The size of a scientist's achievements can only be measured by his contribution to the socialist cause. Therefore, to be determined to be a red expert "must not only be an expert in the science he loves, but he should also be a politician and social activist, actively concerned about the fate of his country, understand the laws of social development, be good at applying these laws, and strive to become an active participant in the country's political leadership work. Of course, this is an additional burden for Bolshevik experts, but it is a promising burden." [Note 4]
    At present, we have very few Party member scientists. In scientific institutions, Party member cadres mostly do scientific organization work, political and ideological work, and administrative work. They have done a lot of work in organizing the scientific team, publicizing and implementing the Party's various policies on scientific work, helping scientific workers carry out self-ideological transformation, and creating conditions for scientific research work, which has ensured the healthy development of China's scientific cause. However, some Party member cadres lack confidence in working in scientific research institutions, are not at ease in their work, call themselves "transitional cadres," and dare not study their work, "walking around science"; some Party member cadres have the conditions to study their work but have not done so, or have not actively done so, so their professional level has improved very slowly, and they have not been able to figure out the details of scientific research work for a long time, and of course it is even more impossible to transform themselves into experts. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will inevitably delay the development of China's scientific cause. Therefore, Party member cadres must cheer up, study hard, and conscientiously study scientific work. The direction of Party member cadres' efforts in the future is first to understand the details of scientific research work. Every Party member leading cadre in a scientific institution must have a relatively clear understanding of the research topics of their unit, such as the purpose of the research, its academic significance and economic value, what equipment, measures, and conditions are needed for the research, etc. Second, they must gradually master the general laws of scientific research work and the ideological laws of scientific workers, so as to do a good job in ideological and organizational work for formulating scientific plans, cultivating scientific cadres, and carrying out academic activities. When formulating scientific research plans, they must proceed from the nature and development conditions of various disciplines and consider how to specifically implement the policy of combining theory with practice. When implementing the plan, they must pay attention to correcting various conservative ideas and unrealistic deviations. Persist in the socialist line of scientific undertakings and fight against capitalist tendencies at any time. After having a preliminary understanding of the scientific research situation in their department, they can then choose their research focus for further in-depth study. Through this key breakthrough, as well as the supplement of some necessary basic scientific knowledge, they can gradually become experts in a certain field.
    Young scientific workers are the fresh force in the scientific team. They are full of vigor and enterprising spirit and accept new things quickly. This is a good side. But their weakness is the lack of experience in actual struggle and productive labor; the issue of political stance has not been completely resolved. Therefore, they have poor discernment, are easily influenced by others, and are preconceived. Many young people are deeply influenced by the idea of "if you want to be famous, you must dig something out," and are only willing to study their work and are unwilling to care about politics. They put forward arguments such as "expert first and then red" and "division of labor between work and politics." Its essence is the bourgeois individualist idea of fame and fortune. Deep down in their hearts, they regard professional achievements as capital for hunting for honor and status. If young scientific workers do not overcome the individualist idea of becoming famous and establishing a family, it is impossible to cultivate themselves into "both red and expert" scientists needed by socialism. The attitude of doing scholarship from an individualistic starting point will not be honest either. They do not study hard, but try to take shortcuts and aim too high. It is also very difficult for such people to have real achievements in science. Even if they achieve something, they are only using scientific knowledge as "capital" to reach out to the people for fame and status. What is serving the working people and serving socialism is just empty talk. Seriously, they will go from political backwardness to political reaction and become waste products. The fact is very clear that young scientific workers living in the era of the socialist revolution and great leap forward are facing a severe question, that is, whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. Specifically, it is a question of whether to cultivate themselves into a new type of "both red and expert" scientist, or to become a waste product. We believe that the majority of young scientific workers will take the socialist road and are willing to cultivate themselves into "both red and expert" scientists needed for building socialism. However, only good wishes are not enough, but must be seen in action. This requires young people engaged in scientific work to learn both work and politics from the beginning, and also pay attention to physical health. The most important of these is to have the correct political direction, the working-class standpoint, and collectivist thinking. These are all prerequisites for young scientific workers to become red experts. Young scientific workers must solve this fundamental problem, and gradually establish a communist world outlook in their work and study, and in labor training. Only by establishing a communist world outlook can they understand the meaning of life, correctly handle the relationship between individuals and collectives, and consciously contribute their energy and wisdom to the cause of socialist construction. With the correct political direction, they must also master the scientific method of dialectical materialism by studying Marxism-Leninism, and use this method to engage in scientific research and study diligently in order to become experts in their field of science. Young scientific workers must also train themselves to be accustomed to doing organizational work, be good at organizing scientific research most effectively, and use human and material resources reasonably. At the same time, they must exercise their bodies and make themselves healthy people. Only in this way can young scientific workers become the successors of China's scientific cause.

　　建设社会主义需要又红又专的科学家
　　田夫
    我们要在十五年左右的时间内，把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，一定要有高度发达的自然科学和社会科学。解放以来，在党和政府的领导和支持下，我国科学事业得到了很大发展。科学队伍扩大了二十倍，建立和加强了许多新技术和空白科学部门，科学基础薄弱和落后的状况正在迅速改变。但是，现有的科学干部的数量和质量，还远远赶不上我国社会主义建设发展的需要。
    正像斯大林所说的，社会主义建设“需要整批的成百成千的能在各种各样知识部门里精通一项的布尔什维克专家。没有这个，就用不着谈什么我国社会主义建设底很快的速度。没有这个，就用不着谈什么我们会赶上和超过先进的资本主义国家”。〔注一〕可是目前我国科学队伍的基本情况是：红色专家还很少；多数专家是专而不红；许多党员干部是红而不专；许多青年科学工作者不是“边红边专”，而是“先专后红”或“只专不红”。这种情况的造成，是有它的历史根源的。在旧中国，劳动人民的子弟是很少有机会上大学的，只有那些官僚、地主和资本家的子弟，才有可能受到高等教育。出身于剥削阶级家庭，又长期地受到资产阶级教育的知识分子，自然受资产阶级思想的影响很深。因此，在现有的专家中，只有极少数是“又红又专”的科学家。目前的党员干部，一般地缺乏自然科学知识。这些同志参加革命后，长期处在紧张的战争环境，很少有时间进行科学技术的学习。这些就是我国目前缺少又红又专的专家的历史原因。
    现在的情况和旧中国的情况有了根本的不同。随着社会制度的变化，教学制度的改革，现在我国的教育机构，是属于劳动人民的，是为广大劳动人民服务的，“是培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者”的教育机构。〔注二〕在建国初期，党就提出了高等学校必须向工农开门的方针，使工农干部、劳动人民和劳动人民的子弟，有学习文化科学知识的机会。党不仅重视从工人农民中直接培养工人阶级的知识分子；同时也一向重视对旧知识分子进行团结、教育和改造。毛主席说：“我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的”。〔注三〕事实上有不少的知识分子，正遵循着毛主席的教导，在党组织的教育和帮助下，用功学习马克思列宁主义，自觉地进行思想改造，其中有一部分人已经成为红色专家了。
    培养红色专家，建立一支工人阶级的科学队伍，是我们全党和全国人民的历史任务。科学工作者和在科学研究机关工作的党员干部，首先要负起责任来实现这一任务。如何承担这个重大而光荣的历史任务呢？那就必须根据自己不同的情况，努力学习马克思列宁主义，联系实际，改造思想；认真钻研科学业务，掌握科学知识，把自己锻炼成为具有马克思列宁主义思想，能独立进行创造性的科学研究的红色专家。
    要达到这个目的，科学家和在科学机关工作的党员干部，以及青年科学工作者所面对的问题是不同的。
    科学家是科学队伍的主要组成部分，是科学研究工作的重要力量。他们中的大多数，都具有较高的学术水平，通晓本门业务，能独立进行科学研究工作。他们对党重视科学家，关心科学研究工作，从各方面为科学研究工作的开展创立有利条件，都有相当的认识。科学家中的绝对大多数，都愿意接受党的领导，在科学研究工作上做出一些成绩，贡献给国家。但是，由于他们是从旧社会来的，受资产阶级思想影响很深；解放后，虽然经过历次政治运动和思想改造，每个人都有所提高，但由于个人的觉悟程度和进步速度不同，许多人在不同程度上还有资产阶级唯心主义和个人主义思想。科学家在学术思想上的唯心主义观点，主要表现在不承认认识的最根本的源泉是人的生产实践和阶级斗争的实践，而认为是抽象的思维。在这种思想指导下，有些人选择研究题目就不结合我国的具体情况和社会主义建设的需要，而是从书本、文献中去找空子。如果选定的题目是为了从理论上阐明或探讨某一个科学规律，当然是可以的，甚至是必要的；然而有些人却既不考虑理论价值，又不考虑经济价值，仅仅是为了尽快写出论文来猎取名利。有些人以个人主义、自由主义的态度对待科学研究工作计划。在他们看来，“订计划只是为了应付上级”，因此，把计划定得“外行看了点头，内行看了摸不着头”。科学家中间还有很多人缺乏集体主义的思想，或者没有学会集体工作的方法。他们在进行科学研究工作的时候，是各顾各，“集体单干”，“互不协作”，造成一些研究题目不必要的重复，严重地浪费了人力和物力。一般科学家，特别是自然科学家大都存在着不同程度的忽视政治的倾向，不愿意学习马克思列宁主义，不愿意参加社会活动，不能自觉、认真地进行自我思想改造。不少科学家正是由于在政治上对自己要求不严，资产阶级思想没有得到彻底改造，所以当右派分子猖狂进攻时，就迷失了方向，在思想感情上同右派分子共鸣。甚至有些人也堕落成右派分子。因此，爱国的科学家要想充分发挥自己的才能，在科学研究工作上做出成绩，服务于祖国的社会主义建设，就必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义。在学习中要紧密地联系自己的思想实际和工作实际，把理论作为检查自己思想的武器，批判资产阶级的唯心主义和个人主义思想，抛弃资产阶级的世界观，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观。只有从思想感情到观点立场的转变，才能使自己卓有成效地为祖国的社会主义建设服务；并循着自己工作的实践来进一步认识社会主义和承认社会主义。旧知识分子一直是在“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的思想指导下走过来的，一般都有轻视体力劳动的思想，同劳动人民的思想感情格格不入。因此，要改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，必须接受集体主义的锻炼，体力劳动的锻炼，深入工厂、农村参加体力劳动，从实践中解决个人同集体的关系问题，解决脑力劳动者同体力劳动者结合的问题。我们的科学事业是为社会主义服务的。“为学术而学术”的思想早已受到批判。一个科学家成就的大小，只能拿他对社会主义事业的贡献来衡量。因此，要立志做一个红色专家“决不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的那门科学的专家，他同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家，积极关怀本国命运，通晓社会发展规律，善于运用这些规律，并力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。当然，这对于布尔什维克专家是一种附加的负担，但这是大有出息的一种负担。”〔注四〕
    目前我们的党员科学家还很少，在科学机构中，党员干部多是做科学组织工作、政治思想工作和行政工作。他们在组织科学队伍，宣传与贯彻党对科学工作的各项政策，帮助科学工作者进行自我思想改造，为科学研究工作创造条件等方面，都做了许多工作，保证了我国科学事业的健康发展。但是，有部分党员干部在科学研究机关工作缺乏信心，工作不安心，自称“过渡干部”，不敢钻研业务，“绕着科学走”；有些党员干部有条件去钻业务而没有去钻，或者是没有积极去钻，因而业务水平提高的很慢，长期摸不到科学研究工作的底细，当然更谈不到把自己变成内行和专家了。这种情况如果不迅速改变，势必延缓我国科学事业的发展。因此，党员干部必须振作精神，下苦功学习，认真钻研科学业务。党员干部今后努力的方向，首先是摸科学研究工作之底。科学机关的每一个党员负责干部，都要对本单位的研究题目有个比较清楚的了解，如研究的目的，它的学术意义和经济价值，搞研究需要什么设备、措施、条件等。其次，要逐渐掌握科学研究工作的一般规律和科学工作者的思想规律，以便为制订科学计划、培养科学干部、开展学术活动做好思想工作和组织工作。在制订科学研究计划时，必须从各门学科的性质和发展条件出发，考虑如何具体贯彻理论结合实际的方针。在执行计划时，要注意纠正各种保守思想和不切合实际的偏向。坚持科学事业的社会主义路线，随时和资本主义倾向进行斗争。在对本部门科学研究的情况有了初步的了解之后，就可以进而选择自己研究的重点，作深一步的钻研。经过这种重点突破，以及一些必要基础科学知识的补充，就可以逐渐使自己成为某一方面的内行和专家了。
    青年科学工作者，是科学队伍中的生力军。他们富有朝气和进取心，接受新事物快。这是好的一面。但是他们的弱点是缺乏实际斗争的经验和生产劳动的经验；在政治上立场问题没有得到彻底的解决。因此，辨别力差，容易受人影响，先入为主。许多青年深受“欲成名，必须钻出东西来”的影响，只愿钻研业务，不愿过问政治。他们提出什么“先专后红”，“业务政治分工”等论调。其实质，是资产阶级个人主义的名利思想。他们的思想深处是把业务成就当作猎取荣誉地位的资本。青年科学工作者，如不克服个人主义的成名成家思想，要想把自己培养成为社会主义所需要的“又红又专”的科学家，是不可能的。从个人主义出发搞学问的态度也不会是老实的。他们不是刻苦钻研，而是企图走捷径，好高骛远。这样的人在科学上要想有真正的成就，也是很困难的。他们即使有所成就，也不过是把科学知识作为“资本”，向人民伸手要名誉要地位而已。什么为劳动人民服务，为社会主义服务，只不过是一句空话。严重的，就会从政治上的落后走上政治上的反动，变成废品。事实很明显，生活在社会主义革命大跃进时代的青年科学工作者，面对着一个严峻的问题，就是走社会主义的道路，还是走资本主义道路的问题。具体的说，是要把自己培养成为一个“又红又专”的新型的科学家，还是要成为废品。我们相信，大多数青年科学工作者，是会走社会主义道路的，也愿意把自己培养成为建设社会主义所需要的“又红又专”的科学家。但是，只有好的愿望是不够的，而必须见之于行动。那就要求从事科学工作的青年，一开始就要既学业务，也要学政治，还要注意身体健康。这其中最主要的则是要有正确的政治方向，工人阶级立场和集体主义思想。这些都是青年科学工作者能否成为红色专家的前提。青年科学工作者要解决这个根本性的问题，就必须在自己的工作和学习中，在劳动锻炼中，逐步树立共产主义世界观。只有树立了共产主义世界观，才能懂得人生的意义，才能正确地处理个人与集体的关系，并自觉地把自己的精力和智慧贡献给社会主义建设事业。有了正确的政治方向，还必须通过学习马克思列宁主义，掌握辩证唯物主义的科学方法，并用这种方法去从事科学研究，刻苦地钻研，才能成为本门科学的专家。青年科学工作者，还要训练自己习惯于做组织工作，善于最有成效地组织科学研究，合理使用人力物力。同时还要锻炼身体，使自己成为体魄健全的人。只有这样，青年科学工作者才能成为我国科学事业的继承人。
