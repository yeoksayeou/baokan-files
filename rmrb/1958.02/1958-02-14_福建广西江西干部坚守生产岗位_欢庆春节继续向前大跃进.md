Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: Cadres in Fujian, Guangxi, and Jiangxi provinces, along with the masses, have decided to break with convention during the Spring Festival, putting forward the battle cry of not taking leave, not going home, and not delaying production, concentrating all efforts to strive for a great leap forward in production.

　　In Guangze County, Fujian Province, all 983 county and district government cadres are determined not to take leave or return home during the Spring Festival, and to persist in production and work. Su Guanren, a typist at the county People's Committee, and Li Qingsen, a general affairs staff member, who had originally planned to return home for their weddings or to visit relatives during the Spring Festival, have postponed their trips home. All 1,700 township and commune cadres in the county have also pledged to lead the masses in continuing to do a good job in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and field management during the Spring Festival, ensuring that the festival does not interfere with production. In Shunchang County, more than 300 office cadres have decided to divide themselves into two groups during the Spring Festival, taking turns going to the countryside to participate in production and staying in the offices to continue their work. The first group of 187 cadres who will go to the countryside to participate in production and celebrate the festival with the masses has already set off with hoes. More than 3,000 employees in the financial and trade departments in Fuzhou City have decided to maintain normal business hours during the Spring Festival, or to take advantage of the holiday to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in physical labor. The laborers at the second-phase construction site of the Gutian Hydroelectric Power Station have also posted big-character posters, guaranteeing that they will continue production as usual during the Spring Festival, and improve labor efficiency and quality, using the achievement of completing the second-phase project ahead of schedule to celebrate the festival.

　　Farmers and rural cadres participating in water conservancy construction and afforestation in Guangxi Province have put forward the slogan of not stepping down from the front line during the Spring Festival and taking the lead in advancing during the Spring Festival, demanding that this year's Spring Festival be turned into a festival of labor and construction. The 60,000 laborers participating in water conservancy construction in Lingui County have proposed not leaving the construction site during the Spring Festival, striving to complete the county's plan to expand the irrigated area by 470,000 mu by the end of February. The common slogan put forward by cadres and masses in the Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County is: "Secretaries go up the mountain, cadres go up the mountain, Party and League members go up the mountain, Lusheng (a traditional Miao instrument) and Caidiao (a folk opera) go up the mountain, blacksmiths and sales agents go up the mountain, medical personnel go up the mountain, 70% of the labor force goes up the mountain," launching a concentrated effort to reclaim wasteland and plant trees, and not stepping down from the front line during the Spring Festival. In order to achieve the plan of planting 45,000 mu of trees before the Spring Festival, Miao farmers in twelve townships in Antai District have volunteered to forgo the historically solemn Miao New Year and insist on developing barren mountains. During the Spring Festival, they will celebrate a year of unity with their Han brothers on the mountains. The CPC Yongning Prefectural Committee has decided to organize one million laborers to go to the mountains for afforestation during the Spring Festival. The CPC Yishan Prefectural Committee has also issued a call for leading cadres at all levels to go to the front line during the Spring Festival. More than 200 office cadres in Liujiang County have prepared their luggage and are about to leave for the construction sites to work with the laborers and celebrate the Spring Festival together.

　　In Jiangxi Province, tens of thousands of cadres who have been sent down to the mountainous areas have also recently expressed their intention not to return home for the Spring Festival. Guarantees and resolutions have been flying to the headquarters of various reclamation farms like snowflakes in recent days. Some resolutions and guarantees also described the benefits of not going home for the Spring Festival. All 170 people in the Mengshan Reclamation Farm not going home can save 3,100 yuan in travel expenses and contribute 1,190 more workdays.

    福建广西江西干部坚守生产岗位
    欢庆春节继续向前大跃进
    据新华社13日讯　福建、广西、江西的许多干部和群众决定打破常规过春节，纷纷提出春节不请假、不回家、不误生产，集中一切力量力争生产大跃进的战斗口号。
    福建省光泽县全县九百八十三个县、区机关干部都决心要在春节期间不请假、不回家，坚持生产和工作。原来准备在春节回家结婚或探亲的县人民委员会打字员苏观仁、总务人员李清森等，都推迟了回家结婚和探亲的日期。全县一千七百多个乡社干部也都保证要在春节期间带领群众继续作好兴修水利、积肥和田间管理等生产工作，作到过节不误生产。顺昌县的三百多名机关工作干部，决定在春节期间分成两批，轮流下乡参加生产和留在机关坚持工作，第一批下乡参加生产、同群众一起过节的一百八十七名干部已经在日前带了锄头出发。福州市财贸部门的三千多名职工都决定春节期间照常营业，或者利用春节例假上山下乡参加体力劳动。古田水力发电站第二期工地上的民工也纷纷贴出大字报，保证春节照常坚持生产，并提高劳动效率和质量，用提前修好第二期工程的成就来欢庆佳节。
    广西省参加兴修水利、造林的农民和农村干部，提出春节不下火线、春节带头上前线的口号，要求把今年的春节变成一个劳动的、建设的春节。临桂县六万参加兴修水利的民工，提出春节不离工地，力争全县在2月底完成灌溉面积四十七万亩的兴修水利计划。大苗山苗族自治县的干部和群众提出的共同口号是：书记上山，干部上山，党、团员上山，籚笙、彩调上山，铁匠、代销店上山，医务人员上山，70％的劳动力上山，突击开荒造林，春节不下火线。安泰区为了实现春节前造林四万五千亩的计划，有十二个乡的苗族农民自愿不过历来十分隆重的苗年，坚持开拓荒山。春节期间，在山上和汉族兄弟欢度团结年。中共邕宁地委已经决定在春节期间组织一百万劳动力上山造林；中共宜山地委也发出了各级领导干部春节上前线的号召。柳江县有两百多名机关干部已经准备行装，即将出发到工地上，同民工一起劳动，共度春节。
    江西省下放到山区的几万名干部，最近也纷纷表示春节不回家，保证书和决心书这几天像雪片一样飞向各垦殖场场部。有的决心书和保证书中还述了不回家过春节的好处。蒙山垦殖场全场一百七十多人不回家，共可节省路费三千一百元，多做劳动日一千一百九十个。
