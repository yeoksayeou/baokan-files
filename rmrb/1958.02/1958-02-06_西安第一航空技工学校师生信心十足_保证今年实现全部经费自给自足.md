Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 5th—Teachers and students of the Xi'an First Aviation Technical School decided to launch another great leap forward with revolutionary heroic spirit. At the oath-taking rally of all teachers and students on the evening of January 31, they announced: The original goal of striving to achieve full self-sufficiency by next year will be realized one year ahead of schedule this year; from this year on, they will not ask the state for a single penny, and will train 300 technical workers with socialist consciousness for the country every year.

In recent days, after studying the report of Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Second Session of the First Congress of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the report of Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Secretary Meeting of the Industrial and Mining Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all teachers and students further developed collective wisdom and deeply discussed this year's teaching and production internship plans. During the discussion, they discovered that there was still much potential in implementing work-study programs. After careful accounting, they believed that the goal of achieving self-sufficiency one year ahead of schedule could be achieved this year.

When discussing the income part, the workshop directors, teachers, and old workers of the internship factory all suggested that the processing time for lathe parts can be reduced by half this year, the assembly time for fitters can also be reduced by one-third, and the output value of electricians can be increased several times. Therefore, everyone believes that the original planned total output value of 2.1 million yuan this year can be overfulfilled, and after deducting material costs from the wealth created by this labor, a net profit of 1.8 million yuan can be obtained. They carefully calculated this year's various expenses and reduced the original budget of 710,000 yuan for all teaching expenses to 600,000 yuan. The school originally planned to accumulate 1.2 million yuan as production working capital. After clearing the warehouse and accounts, it was found that the inventory of equipment, semi-finished products, and reprocessed products was worth more than 400,000 yuan, and there was still more than 100,000 yuan in existing working capital. If the production working capital turnover cycle is changed from once a year to once every six months, the existing 600,000 yuan of working capital can meet the needs of future expanded reproduction. The school also considered that it would gradually expand its production scale this year. The 30 self-made lathes will be put into production in June this year, and there is no need to purchase other equipment. In this way, the originally planned equipment cost of 500,000 yuan was reduced to 220,000 yuan. In order to improve product quality and meet the task of trial-producing products, they also want to renovate a workshop and build a new central laboratory and central measurement room, simplifying the design and reducing the original plan of 300,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan. According to the above calculations, they can not only achieve self-sufficiency and self-investment in basic construction, but also save a net profit of 80,000 yuan to be turned over to the state.

All teachers and students of the school unanimously support the new plan to achieve self-sufficiency this year. Teachers and students have submitted letters of guarantee, determined to achieve this goal. (Wang Jian)

　　西安第一航空技工学校师生信心十足
    保证今年实现全部经费自给自足
    本报特约新华社西安5日电　西安第一航空技工学校师生决定以革命英雄气概再来一个大跃进。在上月31日晚上全校师生的誓师大会上，他们宣布：原计划明年争取达到全部经费自给自足的目标，要提前一年在今年实现；从今年起便不向国家要一个钱，每年为国家培养三百名有社会主义觉悟的技术工人。
    最近几天来，全校师生学习了中共上海市委书记柯庆施在中共上海市第一届代表大会第二次会议上的报告和中共陕西省委书记方仲如在中共陕西省委工矿党委书记会上报告后，进一步发挥集体智慧，深入地讨论了今年的教学和生产实习计划。讨论中，他们发觉在执行勤工俭学方面还有许多潜力，通过算细账后，认为今年便能提前一年实现经费自给自足的目标。
    在讨论收入部分时，实习工厂的车间主任、教师、老工人都提出：今年车工零件加工可压缩一半工时，钳工装配也可减少工时三分之一，电工的产值还可成倍地提高。因此，大家都认为今年原订二百一十万元总产值完全可以超额完成，从这笔劳动创造出来的财富中扣除材料费还可净得一百八十万元。他们精打细算的计算了今年的各项开支，把原预算全部教学经费七十一万元减少到六十万元。这个学校原打算积累一百二十万元作为生产流动资金，经清查仓库和账目后，发觉库存器材、半成品和再制品约值四十多万元，现存流动现金还有十多万元，如果把生产用流动资金使用周期从一年一次改变为半年一次，已有的六十万元流动资金便可满足今后扩大再生产的需要。这个学校还考虑到今年要逐步扩大生产规模，自制的三十台车床在今年6月份将投入生产，不必要再购买其他设备。这样原计划五十万元的设备费便减为二十二万元。为要提高产品质量和满足试制产品任务，他们还要在改建一个车间和新建中心试验室和中心计量室时，因陋就简把原计划三十万元降低为十五万元。按照上述计算，他们不但能作到自给自足，自行投资进行基本建设，还可节余八万元净利上缴国家。
    这个学校的全体师生一致拥护今年实现自给自足的新方案。师生们都纷纷提出保证书，决心实现这个目标。　（汪坚）
