According to the Zhejiang Daily report: A new style of learning of “teaching, learning, and farming simultaneously” is taking shape at Zhejiang Agricultural College. This is a major achievement in the rectification of Zhejiang Agricultural College.

From next semester onwards, every teacher, student, and staff member of Zhejiang Agricultural College will participate in planting experimental fields. Senior teachers will conduct comprehensive experiments in the experimental fields, fully implement advanced technologies, and ensure high yields. Currently, Jin Mengjia, the Party Secretary and President of the College, has formed a three-crop rice high-yield team with Professor Shen Xuenian, Associate Professors Wu Changji, Ye Changfeng, Yu Zhenyu, and Lecturer Li Xueliu. Among them are rice cultivation experts, rice pest experts, and experts in seed and soil research. They have formulated a detailed comprehensive plan, requiring that the yield of rice per mu in the 2.5 mu experimental field this year be increased from more than 727 jin in 1957 to 1,500 jin, striving to reach 1,800 jin. A two-crop-a-year (single-season late rice and winter barley) high-yield team composed of Vice President Professor Ding Zhenlin, Deputy Party Secretary Han Guang, and Associate Professor Chen Xichen, requires that the yield of late rice and barley per mu this year reach 1,500 jin, striving to reach 1,800 jin. A cotton-grain two-crop high-yield team composed of Vice President Professor Xiao Fu, Associate Professor Qu Tianxiang, and Lecturer Ji Daofan, requires that the yield of cotton this year reach 150 jin per mu, striving to reach 200 jin.

The news that school leaders and professors are personally taking the lead in planting experimental fields has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of young teachers and students. A dozen young teachers from the Agronomy Department have formed a production commando team, selected two mu of land as high-yield experimental fields, and have already applied fertilizer to the fields. Some second-year students from the Horticulture Department have repeatedly requested the leadership to approve their engagement in high-yield experimental fields, expressing their desire to compete with the senior teachers. In addition to focusing on high-yield experimental fields, many faculty and students have requested to gain practical experience in agricultural production through hands-on farming. According to the principle of developing a diversified agricultural economy while prioritizing grain production, all first-year students will participate in planting large field crops at the college's practice farm; students in the second year and above will engage in various experimental fields according to their respective majors, requiring them to be responsible for contracting labor, production, and costs. In the past, student teaching internships were concentrated in the last four weeks of a semester. From next semester onwards, it has been decided to break with convention and arrange teaching internships according to the production season, so that students can have the opportunity to operate personally throughout the entire process of crop growth.

In order to thoroughly overcome the situation of each engaging in its own affairs in scientific research and detachment from the actual agricultural production of the province, Zhejiang Agricultural College emphasizes the connection and collaboration in scientific research, conducts comprehensive experimental research, and emphasizes that scientific research must serve the great leap forward in agricultural production in the province. Currently, under the leadership of the Party and government leaders of the college, a research group including five teaching and research sections and thirty teachers has been organized to specifically study how to use horse manure, cow manure, human manure, rice straw, etc. to produce biogas for lighting and powering agricultural machinery. After this experiment achieves success, it will greatly contribute to solving the fuel problem for rural lighting and power in the province. In addition, the college also organized teachers to visit Xiaogan County, a "thousand-jin county" for rice in Hubei; a group was assigned among the teachers sent to the countryside to summarize large-area high-yield experiences in Huangyan County; and teachers including those in soil, geology, and water conservancy were organized to go to Longyou and Qu County to study the causes of low yields in low-yield fields and find ways to increase production.

Currently, a large-scale spring plowing movement is underway at Zhejiang Agricultural College. Although the semester exams are very intense these days, the students take time every day to catch insects, remove weeds, eliminate rats, and catch sparrows. Within two years, they will not only eliminate the four pests, but also eliminate various plant diseases and insect pests in the school's farm. In order to over fulfill the task of accumulating 150,000 dan of fertilizer for the 1,000 mu experimental farm, all teachers and students are willing to postpone the holiday and fight for five days. This decision has been warmly supported by all faculty, staff, and students. Many teachers and students have launched challenges and responses. A total of 1,230 faculty, students, and farm workers have volunteered to participate in this voluntary labor. In eight and a half days, more than 57,400 dan of pond mud were dug.

    院长党委书记齐动手　争取亩产水稻一千八
    浙江农学院师生自种丰产试验田
    据浙江日报报道　“边教边学边种田”的新学风正在浙江农学院形成。这是浙江农学院整改中的重大收获。
    从下学期起，浙江农学院全校师生员工每个人都要动手种试验田。老教师将在试验田里进行综合性试验，全面贯彻先进技术，保证达到丰产。现在，院党委书记、院长金孟加已和教授沈学年、副教授吴昌济、叶常丰、俞震豫、讲师李学骝等组成水稻三熟丰产小组。他们当中有水稻栽培专家、水稻病虫害专家，也有研究种子、土壤的专家。他们订出了详细的综合规划，要求今年在二亩半试验田里，每亩水稻产量从1957年的七百二十七斤多提高到一千五百斤，争取达到一千八百斤。副院长丁振麟教授、院党委副书记韩光和陈锡臣副教授等组成的一年两熟（单季晚稻、冬季大麦）丰产小组，要求今年晚稻和大麦产量每亩达到一千五百斤，争取达到一千八百斤。副院长萧辅教授和屈天祥副教授、季道藩讲师等组成的棉粮两熟丰产小组，要求今年棉花产量达到每亩一百五十斤，争取达到二百斤。
    学校领导人和教授们亲自带头种试验田的消息传开后，大大鼓舞了青年教师和学生们的干劲。农学系的十几个青年教师组成了生产突击队，选定了两亩田作为丰产试验田，并且已在田里施下了肥。园艺系二年级有些学生，一再要求领导上批准他们搞丰产试验田，他们表示要和老教师们竞赛。除了有重点地搞丰产试验田以外，许多教职员和学生要求通过亲手种田，取得农业生产的实际经验。根据在优先发展粮食生产的条件下，发展农业多种经济的方针，一年级学生将全部在院内的实习农场参加种大田作物；二年级以上的学生，则根据各人专业分别搞各种试验田，要求做到包工、包产、包本。过去学生教学实习是集中在一学期的最后四星期中进行的，从下学期起，决定打破常规，根据生产季节来安排教学实习，使学生在作物生长的全部过程中，都能得到亲自操作的机会。
    浙江农学院为了彻底克服科学研究中各自为政和脱离本省农业生产实际的状况，十分强调在科学研究中的联系协作，进行综合性的试验研究，同时强调科学研究必须为本省的农业生产大跃进服务。目前，在该院党政负责同志领导下，已组织了一个包括五个教研组、三十位教师的研究小组，专门研究如何利用马粪、牛粪、人粪、稻草等制造沼气，用来点灯和发动农业机械的问题。这个试验取得成效后，对解决全省农村照明、动力的燃料问题将有很大的作用。此外，该院还曾组织教师到湖北的水稻“千斤县”——孝感县去参观访问；在下放的教师中配备了一个小组，到黄岩县去总结大面积丰产经验；组织了包括土壤、地质、水利等方面的教师去龙游、衢县研究低产田的低产原因，找出增产的办法。
    现在，一个大规模的备耕运动正在浙江农学院展开。这几天虽然学期考试很紧张，但是学生们每天都抽出时间捉虫除草，灭鼠捕雀，他们在两年内不但要消灭四害，而且要消灭学校农场内的各种植物病虫害。为了超额完成实验农场一千亩积肥十五万担的任务，全校师生都愿意延迟放假，战斗五天。这一决定受到全体教职员工和学生们的热烈支持。许多师生掀起了挑战应战。全校自愿参加这次义务劳动的教职员、学生和农场工人共有一千二百三十人。在八、九两个半天中，共挖塘泥五万七千四百多担。
