    Poverty and Wealth, Good Things and Bad Things

    Not long ago, Jiangsu Province convened a "Socialist Agriculture High Yield Representative Conference." The conference, through a comparison of impoverished and prosperous regions, provided a profound lesson for people, especially representatives from prosperous regions.

    Songjiang and Suzhou prefectures are the most affluent and high-yielding agricultural areas in Jiangsu Province, and are also nationally renowned "lands of fish and rice." High-yield units in such high-production areas should have been at the forefront. However, contrary to expectations, Cai Xiang Agricultural Cooperative in Jurong County, where conditions are not as good as the Taihu Lake basin, achieved a leap forward in rice yield to 1,579 jin per mu. Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Xuzhou City, located on the barren and disaster-prone Huaibei Plain, achieved a leap forward in wheat yield to 815 jin per mu. Meanwhile, Songjiang and Suzhou, the "lands of fish and rice" in the Jiangnan region, which enjoy exceptionally favorable conditions, experienced a much smaller increase in production speed compared to the Su Bei region, where conditions are very poor. This caused people from the "lands of fish and rice" to deeply reflect.

    Why were the wealthy regions actually inferior to the poor regions? According to the self-examinations of representatives from Songjiang and Suzhou prefectures, the reasons were: lack of a great leap forward in thinking and insufficient drive; complacency due to the belief that they were number one in production in the province, leading to a lack of initiative and unwillingness to exert effort and sweat (unwillingness to invest in water conservancy and accumulate manure, preferring to buy cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizers); failure to summarize and learn from high-yield experiences; and cadres not cultivating experimental plots.

    This discussion has profound educational significance. It makes us once again appreciate the truth that good things and bad things can transform into each other. Under certain conditions, bad things can turn into good things, and good things can also turn into bad things. A good climate, fertile land, and abundant resources are all favorable objective conditions, which are good things. However, such good things can sometimes easily lead to complacency, stagnation, and a lack of ambition, resulting in backwardness, which becomes a bad thing. Poor mountains and harsh rivers, frequent disasters, and barren land are unfavorable objective conditions for production, and are naturally bad things. However, such conditions may also motivate people to strive for self-improvement, aim high, conquer nature, and transform the environment. In this way, bad things turn into good things.

    What is the responsibility of leadership? Here, the responsibility of leadership is: first, to strive to turn bad things into good things; second, to do everything possible to avoid turning good things into bad things, and to use these good things to create even greater good things. Specifically, for regions with poor objective conditions, it is necessary to encourage people to fully exert their subjective initiative, use subjectivity to transform objectivity, and change natural conditions. For regions with good objective conditions, it is also necessary to constantly remind people not to be complacent or slack, but to use the superior objective conditions to strive for the rapid development of agricultural production. Many regions have in fact done just that. Their experiences should be heeded by all localities. ·Song Fangzhu·

### 穷和富，好事和坏事

    穷和富，好事和坏事
    不久以前，江苏省召开了一次“社会主义农业高额丰产代表大会”。会议通过贫瘠地区和富庶地区的对比，给人们，特别是给富庶地区的代表，上了深刻的一课。
    松江、苏州两个专区，是江苏省最富庶的农业高产地区，也是全国有名的“鱼米之乡”。这样高产地区的高额丰产单位，本来应该是走在最前面的。但是不然，条件不如太湖流域的句容县蔡巷农业社，水稻亩产量竟跃进到一千五百七十九斤，位于贫瘠多灾的淮北平原上的徐州市郊红星农业社，小麦亩产量竟跃进到八百一十五斤；而得天独厚的江南“鱼米之乡”的松江、苏州两个地区，增产速度却比条件很差的苏北地区小得多。这就使得来自“鱼米之乡”的人们不能不深思猛省了。
    为什么富地区竟不如穷地区呢？根据松江和苏州专区的代表们的检查，原因是：没有跃进思想，干劲不足；自认为产量全省第一，不动脑筋，不肯出力、出汗（不愿多修水利多积肥，只想用钱买饼肥和化学肥料）；不总结、不学习丰产经验；干部不种试验田。
    这一番讨论有很深刻的教育意义。它使我们再一次体会到这样一个真理：好事和坏事是可以互相转化的，在一定的条件下，坏事可以变成好事，好事也可以变成坏事。气候好，土地肥沃，物产富足，这是很有利的客观条件，是好事。然而，这样的好事，有时也容易使人安于现状，故步自封，不知进取，结果造成落后，这就成了坏事。穷山恶水，灾害多，土地瘠薄，这是不利于生产的客观条件，当然是坏事。然而，这样的条件也可能激励人们发愤图强，力争上游，征服自然，改造环境。这样，坏事又成了好事。
    领导的责任是什么呢？在这里，领导的责任就是：第一，力争把坏事变成好事；第二，尽力避免把好事变成坏事，并且利用这个好事做出更大的好事。具体地说，就是：对于客观条件不好的地区，要激励人们高度发挥主观能动性，以主观改造客观，改变自然条件。对于客观条件好的地区，也要经常提醒人们不要自满，不要松懈，而要利用优越的客观条件极力争取农业生产的迅速发展。许多地区事实上也正是这样做了。他们的经验，应当受到各地的注意。　·宋方渚·
