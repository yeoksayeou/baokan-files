    Lenin—Honorary Soldier of the Red Army

    Soviet Red Army soldiers were filled with love for the beloved Communist Party and its founder, Lenin. During the years of the domestic war, many units took Lenin as an honorary soldier, included him in the rolls of their units, and regarded this as a great honor. In this photograph, we can see the "Red Army Soldier Service Handbook" of the honorary Red Army soldier Lenin, of the 1st Platoon, 1st Squad, 195th Yeisk Infantry Regiment.

    As an honorary soldier of the Red Army, Lenin paid special attention to the consolidation and education of the Soviet Army and Navy. One proof of this is the compilation of this first Red Army Soldier Service Handbook. This handbook is a precious Leninist document, because its content was personally reviewed and determined by Lenin himself.

    The first Red Army Soldier Service Handbook was not merely a "notebook," it was actually the basic political textbook for Red Army soldiers during the Soviet domestic revolutionary war, a guide from which soldiers could find answers to questions of a political and military service nature. This booklet was also an important propaganda document, an appeal to the soldiers of the revolutionary army. For example, the handbook contained an appeal to soldiers entitled "Red Army Soldier Comrade, Remember!", which briefly listed all the most important obligations of Red Army soldiers, and in fact, the concept of the military duty of Soviet citizens was constituted by these.

    Here are excerpts from this outstanding document:

    "Red Army Soldier! You are the defender of the interests of workers and poor peasants, you are the defender of the Soviet regime established by workers and peasants, protecting it from the attacks of any enemy.

    Always remember your noble title, and never, under any circumstances, tarnish this title.

    Remember that the Soviet regime gives you weapons to serve the great worker-peasant revolution….

    Always be prepared, when the Soviet regime issues a call, to stand up to defend the oppressed people. Execute orders accurately and quickly, devote yourself to studying military affairs, and carefully study various orders. Never stop learning to fight….

    Be an example of revolutionary consciousness—fight in the front, retreat in the rear.

    Be a model of revolutionary vigor, courage, and discipline.

    Sacredly maintain the spirit of comradeship and the close unity of the Red Army ranks.

    Never break off close ties with your own class, share the life of the working class, participate in its party, and do not isolate yourself from the party.

    Soldier of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army! Always be worthy of being a son of the working people, a staunch fighter of the great revolution."

    The soldiers of the Red Army and Navy gloriously carried out the instructions of the Communist Party and its leader, Lenin. They bravely fought for the cause of the revolution, for the cause of the working people.

    Under the wise leadership of the Lenin's Communist Party, the Soviet armed forces are now vigilantly defending the peaceful labor of the Soviet people, the creators of a communist society. Red Army soldiers strictly implement the great Lenin's behests. They are strengthening the combat effectiveness of the Soviet Army and Navy every day, and are always ready to obey the orders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government to defend the socialist motherland.

    列宁——红军的荣誉战士
    苏联红军战士们充满了对亲爱的共产党及其创建者列宁的热爱。在国内战争年代里，许多部队都把列宁作为荣誉战士，编入自己部队的名册，并且把这事看作是莫大的光荣。在这张照片上，我们可以看到当年第195耶伊斯克步兵团一连一排一班的荣誉红军战士列宁的“红军战士服务手册”。
    作为红军荣誉战士的列宁，对于苏联陆海军的巩固和教育特别注意。这方面的证明之一是这第一种红军战士服务手册的编制。这本手册是珍奇的列宁文献，因为它的内容是经列宁亲自加以审查和确定的。
    第一种红军战士服务手册不仅仅是“笔记”本，它实际上是苏联国内革命战争时期红军战士的基本政治课本，是战士们能从中找到政治性质和军事服务性质问题解答的指南。这一本小册子也是一个重要的宣传鼓动文件，是对革命军队战士的号召。例如，在手册中登载着题为“红军战士同志，要记住！”的一篇对战士的号召，它扼要地列举了红军战士一切最主要的义务，实际上，苏维埃国家军人职责的概念，就是由这些构成的。
    这里摘录这个卓越文件的片断：
    “红军战士！你是工人和贫苦农民的利益的保卫者，你是捍卫工农所建立的苏维埃政权使其免于遭任何敌人进攻的保卫者。
    要永远记住自己的崇高称号，无论何时无论如何不要辱没这个称号。
    要记住，苏维埃政权给予你武器，是要你为伟大的工农革命服务……。
    要随时准备着，当苏维埃政权一发出号召的时候，就挺身起来保卫被压迫的人们。要准确地迅速地执行命令，专心致志地钻研军事业务，认真研究各种命令。永远不要停止学习战斗……。
    要成为革命觉悟方面的典范——战斗在前，退却在后。
    要成为具备革命朝气、勇敢精神的模范和遵守纪律的模范。
    要神圣地保持同志友爱精神，保持红军队伍中的亲密团结。
    永远不要中断与自己阶级的密切联系，要与工人阶级同生命，参加它的党，并且不要同党隔绝。
    工农红军战士！要永远不愧为劳动人民的儿子，要成为伟大革命的坚定战士。”
    红军陆海军战士光荣地执行了共产党及其领袖列宁的指示。他们为了革命事业，为了劳动人民的事业勇敢地进行了斗争。
    苏联武装力量在英明的列宁党的领导下，现正警惕地捍卫着共产主义社会的创造者——苏联人民的和平劳动。红军战士严格地执行着伟大的列宁的遗训。他们每天在加强着苏联陆海军的战斗力，并随时准备遵照共产党和苏联政府的命令来保卫社会主义祖国。
