Shanghai's Thursday
By our Shanghai-based reporter and our correspondent collective writing.

Many people are concerned about the situation in Shanghai after it proposed eliminating bureaucracy and stagnation and promoting revolutionary vigor. Now, let us invite our dear readers to tour Shanghai on a Thursday. From here, you will see some vibrant scenes from Shanghai in the current Great Leap Forward situation.

Thursday is an unusual day in Shanghai.

Since the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to designate Thursday as a "meeting-free day" for municipal and district leading cadres to go deep into the grassroots, connect with the masses, and connect with reality, Thursday has become an extraordinary day. In the past few months, with the deepening of the rectification movement, the content of this activity day has become richer and more developed. On this day, a large number of cadres throughout the city generally leave their offices to carry out mass work.

Always Learn From the Best

Today is February 13th, Thursday.

The weather in Shanghai is sunny and relatively cold, with a morning temperature of five degrees below zero. The office building of the Municipal Party Committee is quiet, and the offices of secretaries and ministers are quiet. Except for the comrades on duty, they have all gone to the grassroots. Shanghai's Patriotic Health Campaign begins its grand evaluation today. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Chen Pixian, Wei Wenbo, Secretaries of the Secretariat, Cao Diqiu, Xu Jianguo, Liu Jiping and other responsible persons, all participated in the inspection work of grassroots units. The reporter and Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhu, District Head of the West Suburbs People’s Committee, first arrived in Huacun Township in the West Suburbs. Here, Comrade Wei Wenbo inspected the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis and personally went to the river to check whether the snails had been completely eliminated.

At 5 pm, they arrived at Baonan Township, more than ten miles away from Huacun Township. Comrade Wei Wenbo had obviously been here many times. He became a skilled guide, leading us to a river that had been renovated exceptionally cleanly. There were no weeds or bricks and tiles along the river. Soft soil was spread on both banks of the river. While walking, Comrade Wei Wenbo said to District Head Zhu and Chen Lanhai, Secretary of the Township General Branch: "The river channels renovated by the People's Liberation Army comrades are really beautiful. There are too many rubble and bricks and tiles along the river, which are often places where snails hide. Of course, the river channels renovated by the masses may be worse than those renovated by the People's Liberation Army, but we must always learn from the best, especially leaders should be more aware. I suggest that it is best to choose an opportunity to bring the branch secretaries there to take a look."

Holding "On-Site Meetings" in Factories

Early in the morning, the reporter rushed to the Third Woolen Mill in Yulin District. The Third Woolen Mill is one of the seventeen factories in Yulin District that have launched an anti-waste campaign and is at the forefront. Today, Xia Mingfang, First Secretary of the Yulin District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and some department heads, held an "on-site meeting" here to introduce experience to other factories in the district. Cadres from various factories packed the meeting room, and everyone listened attentively to the Party Secretary of the Third Woolen Mill introducing the factory's anti-waste experience. The Party Secretary of the Third Woolen Mill said humorously: "The leading cadres of our factory have established a 'court visit' system in the anti-waste movement. Every morning at 7:30, the Party Secretary and the factory director take a group of civil and military generals - heads of various departments - to 'court visit'. We are not going to pay homage to the emperor, but to see the big-character posters newly posted by the masses. While everyone reads, they assign the issues raised by the big-character posters on the spot and immediately deal with them after returning. This makes the rectification speed much faster..."

After the introduction, everyone went to visit the big-character posters of the Third Woolen Mill, visited the production situation in the workshop, and then held informal discussions and discussions. Finally, the District Committee Secretary made a summary. Many cadres from factories where anti-waste work was not going well, or had not yet started, said after participating in this meeting, "Now we have found the key."

This kind of "on-site meeting" is a new thing in Yulin District. In the past, the routine for meetings here was: no matter what was being discussed, grassroots cadres were brought to the leading organs, everyone spoke differently, the meeting time was prolonged, and the effect was limited. In this rectification, the district committee leaders resolutely eliminated bureaucracy, went out of the office, went to the grassroots to find experience, and promoted experience at the grassroots level. Before this meeting at the Third Woolen Mill, the Secretary of the Yulin District Committee had held an "on-site meeting" at the district's joint state-private owned Tongren Alloy Factory, summarizing and introducing the factory's experience in running enterprises diligently and frugally, which gave the responsible cadres of the factories in the entire district a good education.

Factory Director Goes to the Workshop to Acknowledge a Master

"As soon as Factory Director Ai Ding arrives in the morning, he goes to the workshop!" In the morning, when the reporter went to the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory to find Comrade Ai Ding, the comrades in the office told the reporter.

In the tool workshop, Comrade Ai Ding, a Communist Party member with twenty years of party membership, was holding a roll of drawings, standing next to a lathe, and humbly asking a young worker who was operating the lathe, inquiring about the processing procedure of a machine part and learning production technology. Factory Director Ai said to the reporter:

"Today I am going to the workshop to acknowledge a master, first establish a relationship, and after the Spring Festival, we will sign a master-apprentice contract." Speaking of this, Factory Director Ai bent down to help his master move the processed parts, just like a good apprentice.

After lunch, Factory Director Ai found several engineering technicians and asked them about the performance and precision of the twenty-two new varieties to be produced this year. Ai Ding said: "Since June last year, I have been taking a certain amount of time each week to participate in physical labor. At first, I helped sell food and vegetables and do cleaning work in the kitchen. Later, I went to the workshop to do production auxiliary work, moving things, sweeping the floor, etc., which has a certain effect on changing people's incorrect views on these labors, but this cannot be well combined with leading production. Therefore, I want to participate in labor in the future, mainly to learn production technology, so as to specifically lead production and gradually become both red and expert."

Visitors in the Driver's Dormitory

In the driver's dormitory of the second and third teams of the Fair Road Bus Terminal, several guests came early on Thursday morning. When everyone discovered that they were Wang Jifen, Director of the Transportation Bureau, Li Shaozhou, Deputy Director, and Gu Kaixi, Secretary of the Party Committee, they happily gathered around. Everyone sat on the edge of the bed and quickly discussed the current production upsurge without restraint. All over the country, competitions have been launched in terms of 300,000 kilometers without major repairs, extending tire life, and saving gasoline. Does the bus terminal have the conditions to respond? What are some difficulties? This is the theme of their visit to the workers for advice today. A dozen workers spoke one after another, discussing each point one by one. The discussion result was: the initiative of 300,000 kilometers without major repairs can be responded to. Some of the vehicles here have already achieved a record of more than 130,000 kilometers without major repairs, and there is hope of reaching this target if we work harder. Car tires can also be refurbished once they have traveled 100,000 kilometers. As a result of the discussion, everyone also put forward an initiative to "save three liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers."

When discussing safe production, Chen Baolin, the loading and unloading team leader who has been working for thirty years, said indignantly: "Who says accidents are unavoidable? I don't agree." He described his work situation to the leaders: He specializes in loading iron coke discs for steel mills, which is heavy and clumsy, and the most prone to accidents, but the group he leads has never had an accident because it is careful in its work. Efficiency has also been improved. In the past, it took 30 minutes to load a truckload of discs, but now it only takes six or seven minutes. After hearing Chen Baolin say this, everyone admitted that the safe production target could indeed be improved.

The workers then raised their current work concerns: the cooperation of the various relevant parties is not enough. For example, their buses arrive at the work site at 7:30 every morning, but the warehousing department does not open until 9:00, causing a large number of buses to wait empty at the warehouse door. Some departments also do not pay attention to transportation plans. The food company wants refrigerated trucks in this way, almost always wanting a truck for a while and then not wanting it, the refrigerated trucks are traveling back and forth in vain all day, wasting a lot of gasoline and manpower.

Bringing work issues directly to the grassroots and discussing them with the workers, instead of relying on layer-by-layer reports in the office as in the past, is a major reform in the leadership of the Shanghai Transportation Bureau after the rectification. This approach has helped them discover and solve many problems. Today, their conversation with the workers sitting on the edge of the bed has made them much clearer about the issue of the production upsurge in the transportation department.

A Vigorous Force in Agricultural Cooperatives

Early this morning, on the road leading to the suburbs, there was a continuous procession of people, braving the severe cold, setting off to the suburbs for voluntary labor.

What we saw was a team composed of 124 cadres from the Luwan District Committee of the Communist Party of China, including the District Committee Secretary and heads of various departments. They crossed the Huangpu River early in the morning and arrived at the Jinlian Cooperative in Jinqiao Township in the eastern suburbs. Water conservancy is being vigorously built in this suburban area recently, but because there are many families of workers here, there is a lack of labor. The Luwan District cadres who were sent down here to participate in labor reflected this situation to their organs and immediately received a response from the cadres of their organs. Everyone's labor enthusiasm was so high that it made the comrades leading the team embarrassed before they even started working: everyone signed up to do heavy work, and no one applied to do light work. In the end, it was necessary to implement compulsory measures, designating female comrades and comrades with weak bodies to do light labor.

Participating in agricultural labor in the suburbs is a regular activity on Thursdays for many organs in Shanghai. This activity is now gradually developing into a fixed contact system between organs and cooperatives. Organs have an obligation to provide regular support to the agricultural cooperatives they are in contact with. At the same time, this can also strengthen the connection with cadres who have been sent down. On the way back, the comrades of the Luwan District Committee had a heated discussion on this issue, and they decided to institutionalize this activity.

    上海的星期四
    本报驻上海记者、本报通讯员集体采写
    不少人关心着上海市在提出打掉官气和暮气、发扬革命朝气以后的情况。那么，现在我们就请亲爱的读者们，和我们一起来巡视一下上海的一个星期四吧。你将从这里看到在当前大跃进形势中上海的一些生气蓬勃的片段景象。
    星期四，是上海的一个不寻常的日子。
    自从中共上海市委决定把星期四作为市、区领导干部深入基层、联系群众、联系实际的“无会议日”之后，星期四就成了不平常的一天。而这几个月来，随着整风运动的深入，这个活动日的内容更加丰富和发展了。在这一天，全市范围的广大干部，普遍地走出办公室，进行群众工作。
    任何时候都要向好的看齐
    今天是2月13日，星期四。
    上海天气晴朗，气候比较冷，早上温度在零下五度。市委办公大楼里，书记们、部长们的办公室里都静悄悄的，除了值班的同志以外，他们都下基层去了。上海爱国卫生运动今天开始大评比，市委第一书记柯庆施、书记处书记陈丕显、魏文伯，副市长曹荻秋、许建国、刘季平等负责人，全部参加了基层单位的检查工作。记者和中共上海市委书记魏文伯同志、西郊区人民委员会的朱区长，首先到了西郊区的华村乡。在这里，魏文伯同志检查了防治血吸虫病的情况，亲自到河边查看了钉螺是否已经彻底消灭。
    下午五点，又到了离华村乡有十里多路的宝南乡。魏文伯同志显然已到这里来过多次，他成了一个熟练的向导，把我们领到一条修整得异常整洁的河边，沿着河没有杂草，没有砖头瓦砾，松软的泥土平铺在河岸两边，魏文伯同志一边走，一边对朱区长和乡总支书记陈林海同志说：“解放军同志帮我们修整的这些河道真是漂亮。沿河的瓦砾砖头太多了，这些常常是钉螺隐身之处。当然群众修整的河道是可能会比解放军差一些，但我们任何时候总要向好的方面去看齐，特别是领导者心中应该更有数些，我建议最好选择一个机会带那里的支部书记到这里来看一看。”
    下工厂开“现场会议”
    一清早，记者就赶到了榆林区的第三毛纺厂。第三毛纺厂是榆林区开展了反浪费的十七个工厂中跑在最前面的一个。今天中共榆林区委第一书记夏明芳和一些部门负责人，在这里召开“现场会议”，向这个区的其他工厂介绍经验。来自各厂的干部把会议室挤得满满的，大家都在聚精会神地倾听着第三毛纺厂党委书记介绍他们厂的反浪费经验。第三毛纺厂的党委书记风趣地说：“我们厂的领导干部在反浪费运动中建立了一种‘上朝’的制度，每天早晨七点半，党委书记和厂长便带着一批文武将相——各部门负责人去‘上朝’，我们不是去朝见皇帝，而是去看群众新贴出来的大字报，大家一边看，一边就把大字报提出的问题当场分配，回去就立即处理，这样做，整改速度就快得多了……”
    介绍之后，大家就分头参观国毛三厂的大字报，参观车间生产情况，以后又举行漫谈和讨论，最后并由区委书记作了总结。好些反浪费还搞得不好，或者还没有开展起来的厂的干部参加了这次会议以后，都说是“这一下摸着了门道了。”
    这种“现场会议”在榆林区是个新东西。这里过去开会的常规是：不论讨论什么，都把基层干部找到领导机关里来，大家各讲一套，会议时间拖长，效果也受限制。这次整改中，区委领导上坚决打掉官风，走出办公室，到基层去摸经验，并且就在基层推广经验。在国毛三厂这次会议以前，榆林区委书记已在本区的公私合营同仁合金厂里召开过一次“现场会议”，总结和介绍了这个厂勤俭办企业的经验，使参加会议的全区工厂负责干部受了一次很好的教育。
    厂长下车间拜师傅
    “艾丁厂长早上一来，就到车间去了！”上午，记者到国营上海机床厂去找艾丁同志时，办公室的同志这样告诉记者。
    在工具车间里，有着二十年党龄的共产党员艾丁同志，手里拿着一卷图纸，站在一台车床旁边，正虚心地向操纵这台车床的青年工人请教，询问着一个机件的加工程序，学习生产技术。艾厂长对记者说：
  “今天我是下车间拜师傅，先接上关系，春节过后，我们还要订一个师徒合同。”说到这里，艾厂长就弯腰替他的师傅搬加工的机件，就像一个很好的学徒那样。
    吃过午饭以后，艾厂长又找了几个工程技术人员，向他们请教今年要生产的二十二个新品种的性能和精密度。艾丁说：“从去年6月份起，我每星期抽出一定的时间参加体力劳动，起初是到厨房里帮助卖饭、卖菜和做清洁工作，后来到车间里做生产辅助工作，搬搬东西，扫扫地等，这对改变人们对这些劳动的不正确的看法有一定的作用，但这不能很好地和领导生产结合起来，因此，我想今后参加劳动，主要是学习生产技术，以便具体领导生产，逐步做到又红又专。”
    驾驶员宿舍里的来客
    公平路汽车一场二、三队的驾驶员宿舍里，星期四一清早就进来了几位客人，当大家发现他们就是交通局局长王季芬、副局长李绍周和党委书记顾开极的时候，就高兴地围了拢来。大家坐在床边上，很快就无拘束地讨论起了当前的生产高潮问题。三十万公里无大修、延长轮胎使用寿命、节约汽油等方面，各地都已经发起了竞赛，汽车一场有没有条件应战？有些什么困难？这是今天他们下来向工人们请教的主题。十几个工人你一言，我一语，逐条的加以讨论，讨论结果是：三十万公里无大修的倡议可以响应，这里的车子有的已做到十三万公里以上无大修的纪录，再努一把力是有希望达到这个指标的。汽车轮胎也可以做到行驶十万公里翻修一次。讨论的结果，大家还提出了一个“每百公里节约三公升汽油”的倡议。
    在讨论到安全生产的时候，已经有三十年工龄的装卸组长陈宝林激愤地说：“谁说事故是不可避免的？我就不同意。”他向首长叙述了他的工作情况：他是专装钢铁厂的铁焦圆盘的，这活重而笨，最容易出事故，可是他所领导的小组，因为工作中谨慎小心，就从来没出过事故。效率也提高了，过去装一卡车圆盘要三十分钟，现在只要六、七分钟。大家听陈宝林这么一说，都承认安全生产的指标确实还可以提高。
    工人们接着又提出了他们目前工作中的苦恼：各有关方面对他们的协作配合不够。比如，他们的汽车每天早晨七点半就开到工作地点，可是仓储部门要九点钟才办公，使得汽车大批的在仓库门口空等。也有些部门不重视运输计划，食品公司要冷藏车就是这样，几乎经常是一会儿要车子，一会儿又不要了，冷藏车整天徒劳往返，浪费了许多汽油和人力。
    把工作问题直接地带到下边去，和工人们商量，而不是像过去那样坐在办公室里依靠一层层的汇报，这是上海交通局领导干部在整风以后领导工作上的一个大改革，这种做法帮助他们发现和解决了许多问题。今天，他们坐在床边上和工人们的一席谈话，使他们对交通部门的生产高潮问题，心里亮堂得多了。
    农业社里的生力军
    这天一清早，走向郊区的大路上，不绝地行进着群众的队伍，他们冒着严寒，出发到郊区去义务劳动。
    我们看到的是由中共芦湾区委一百二十四个干部，包括区委书记和各部部长等组成的一支队伍，他们一早度过了黄浦江，来到了东郊金桥乡金联社。这一带郊区最近正在轰轰烈烈地兴修水利，但因为这里工人家属多，劳动力缺乏。下放在这里参加劳动的芦湾区干部向本机关反映了这个情况，立即得到了本机关干部的响应。大家的劳动热情是那么高，以致还未开始干活就使带队的同志为了难：人人都报名要干重活，没有一个人申请干轻活。最后只好实行强制办法，指定女同志和身体弱的同志作轻劳动。
    到郊区参加农业劳动，是上海许多机关在星期四的一项经常活动，这项活动现在正逐步发展成为一种机关与合作社之间的固定联系制度，机关有义务对它所联系的农业社给予经常的支援，同时这还可以加强和下放干部的联系。芦湾区委的同志在归来的途中，热烈地讨论了这个问题，他们决定要把这个活动制度化起来。
