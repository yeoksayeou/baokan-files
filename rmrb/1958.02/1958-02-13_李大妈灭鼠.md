    Auntie Li Eliminates Rats
    By our reporter, Yu Feng
    One afternoon, Comrade Liu from the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee of Anhui Province accompanied me to visit Auntie Li. As we walked from Miao Street in Hefei City into a small alley, we noticed that the alley was particularly clean. Comrade Liu said, "Before liberation, this was a notorious stinking alley. The reactionary Kuomintang troops lived nearby, dug up the stones in the alley, leaving it full of potholes. Whenever it rained, sewage and manure filled the ground. After liberation, Auntie Li took the lead in mobilizing everyone to fill in the road and change the sanitary conditions here."
    Auntie Li's name is Li Daoying, and the residents all call her Old Model. She is sixty-two years old this year and still full of vigor. She lives in a very simple house, but she keeps everything clean and tidy. From 1953 to now, she has caught more than 5,000 rats in various places. Two months ago, while she was attending the Municipal People's Congress, she did not participate in the evening entertainment activities and continued to set rat traps as usual, catching more than thirty rats in ten days.
    Auntie Li is now the deputy director of the Miaohou Street Residents' Committee, responsible for leading sanitation work. This Residents' Committee has consistently maintained regular sanitation work from 1952 to now. Now, this street has basically eliminated the four pests. You can't see flies in the summer, people don't sleep with mosquito nets, and there are no rats biting food or clothes at home. I visited more than twenty residents' homes on this street. Their living conditions are not good. Many households have their stoves in their homes, but every home is clean and bright, neat and tidy. A woman named Yu Xiaoyun who lived here moved to the outside of the East Gate some time ago, but after a few days she moved back. She said that she had become accustomed to the sanitary environment here and was reluctant to move away.
    It was not easy to promote sanitation work here at the beginning. Auntie Li told me that most of the people living here are poor households. When they are mobilized to pay attention to hygiene and eliminate the four pests, they rarely have extra money to buy rat traps and fly swatters. At first, Auntie Li saved some of the money she made from making shoe soles to buy rat traps and fly swatters for them. In 1952 and 1953 alone, she bought one hundred and ninety-six rat traps and many fly swatters. She said that it was okay to make a few more shoe soles to buy tools to encourage the masses to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene. The most difficult thing was to encounter people with closed minds. If he doesn't clean up, and you help him sweep, he will scold you. Auntie Li said that in 1953 she led a shock team to help bachelor Luo the carpenter clean up. Luo the carpenter was unwilling and would not allow them to clean up. When they washed off a layer of black dirt from his pot lid, he even said that they had eaten his pot lid. Later, Auntie Li introduced Luo the carpenter to make rat traps in the city for more than forty days and earned dozens of yuan. When he came back, he found Auntie Li and said, "Auntie Li, thank you for introducing me to make rat traps." From then on, he not only worked hard to clean up, but also became the head of the sanitation team. Auntie Li also organized many children on this street to swat flies. From 1954, every summer vacation she formed a fly-swatting team with a hundred or so school-age children. She made fly swatters for the children, and sometimes even led the children out to swat flies. When school was about to start, she used her prize money to buy prizes for the children who swatted flies. She said that the Communist Party and the People's Government cultivate and encourage her, and she also has the responsibility to cultivate and encourage the masses, and unite everyone to do a good job in sanitation.
    I asked her why she was so enthusiastic and persistent about the patriotic health movement. She said, "Other people have children who can defend the country, but I don't; but I can't have no contribution to the country. I can do the work of eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, and I will definitely take the lead in doing it to the end!"
    Don't look down on Auntie Li as a sixty-two-year-old woman, she does such a good job in sanitation, and she holds so many positions. She serves as the deputy director of the Residents' Committee, the grassroots president of the Red Cross, the director of the Women's Federation of the Residents' Committee, the head of the nursery station, and the People's Representative of the district and the city. Last year she also learned more than a thousand characters in the literacy class! Her enthusiasm is worthy of our learning.

    李大妈灭鼠
    本报记者　于风
    一天下午，安徽省爱国卫生运动委员会的刘同志，陪我去访问李大妈。走到合肥市庙街转进一条小巷时，我们看到这条巷子显得特别干净，刘同志说：“解放前这里是有名的臭人巷，国民党反动军队住在附近，挖走了巷里的石头，弄得坑坑洼洼，一下雨污水粪便满地。解放后李大妈带头发动大家，才把这条路填平，改变了这里的环境卫生”。
    李大妈的名字叫李道英，居民都叫她老模范。她今年六十二岁了，还是那样精神抖擞。她住在一间很简陋的房子里，但她把所有的东西都弄得干净利落。从1953年到现在，她已在各处捕鼠五千多只。两月前她参加市人民代表大会期间，晚上不参加文娱活动，照常下鼠夹捕鼠，十几天捕了三十多只老鼠。
    李大妈现在是庙后街居民委员会的副主任，负责领导卫生工作。这个居民委员会从1952年到现在，一直坚持了经常性的卫生工作。现在，这条街已经基本上消灭了四害，夏天看不到苍蝇，人们不放蚊帐睡觉，家里的吃食、衣物也没有老鼠咬。我参观了这条街的二十多家居民住房，他们的居住条件并不好。很多户的锅灶都安在住房里，但是家家的房里房外都是整洁明净，清清爽爽。住在这里的一个妇女虞小云，前些日子搬到东门外去住，没有几天她又搬回来了，她说她已经习惯了这里的卫生环境，舍不得搬走。
    这里的清洁卫生工作，开始不是很容易推动的。李大妈告诉我，这里住的大多是贫苦户，发动他们讲卫生除四害，他们很少有多余的钱买鼠夹、蝇拍。最初，李大妈把纳鞋底维持生活的几块钱节约一部分，买鼠夹、蝇拍送给他们，只是1952年和1953年两年，她就买了一百九十六把鼠夹和许多蝇拍。她说，自己多纳几双鞋底买工具，推动群众除四害讲卫生，这件事还好做，最困难的是碰上思想不通的人，他不打扫卫生，你去帮他扫，他还要骂你。李大妈说，1953年她带着突击队去帮助单身汉罗木匠打扫卫生，罗木匠不愿意，不许她们打扫。她们把他锅盖上一层黑垢洗掉，他还说把他的锅盖啃掉了。后来，李大妈介绍罗木匠到市里去做了四十多天的鼠夹，得了几十元，他回来就找李大妈说：“李大妈，谢谢你介绍我去做鼠夹。”从此以后，他不但努力打扫卫生，还当了卫生小组长。李大妈还把这条街上的许多小孩组织起来扑灭苍蝇。从1954年起，每年暑期她都把百十个学龄儿童组成灭蝇队，她给孩子们做蝇拍，有时还带领孩子们出去打苍蝇。快开学的时候，用自己所得的奖金买奖品送给打苍蝇的孩子们。她说，共产党和人民政府培养鼓励她，她也有责任培养鼓励群众，把大家团结起来做好卫生工作。
    我问她为什么对爱国卫生运动这样热心，这样坚持不懈，她说：“别人有孩子能保卫国家，我没有；可是我对国家不能没有贡献。我能做除四害讲卫生的工作，我一定带头把它做到底！”
    别看李大妈是一个六十二岁的老太太，她把卫生工作搞得这样好，担任的工作也真不少，她担任居民委员会副主任，红十字会基层会长，居民委员会的妇联主任，幼儿站站长，区和市的人民代表。去年她在扫盲班还学会了一千多个字呢！她的干劲，值得我们学习。
