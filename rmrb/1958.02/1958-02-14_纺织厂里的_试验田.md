    "Experimental Fields" in Textile Factories

    The Xi'an Daily reported on February 10th on its front page: Shaanxi Province's textile industry will make a great leap forward this year. The Northwest Textile Administration recently held a joint conference of factory directors, which decided to do everything possible to improve product quality and save cotton this year. It will also conduct large-scale, first-time trials and production of new products, saving the state more than 70 million yuan this year.

    In order to achieve the leap forward goals, the Textile Administration has decided to use the No. 2 and No. 5 State-owned Cotton Factories as "experimental fields" for in-depth work. At the same time, it requires each factory to designate one or two workshops or work areas as "experimental fields" to create experience and guide the entire factory.

    纺织厂里的“试验田”
    10日西安日报一版头条报道：陕西省纺织工业今年要大跃进，西北纺织管理局最近开了个厂长联席会议，决定今年要千方百计地提高产品质量、节约用棉，并要大规模地第一次试制和生产新产品，今年将为国家节省七千多万元。
    为着实现跃进目标，纺管局决定以国棉二厂和五厂作为深入工作的“试验田”，同时要求每厂都要确定一、二个车间或工区作为“试验田”，创造经验，指导全厂。
