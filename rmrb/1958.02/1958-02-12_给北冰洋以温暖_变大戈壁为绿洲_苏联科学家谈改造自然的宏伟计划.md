Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: In the past year or so, many Soviet scientists and engineers have frequently talked about various bold and grand designs and ideals for large-scale transformation of nature. They talked about building a dam across the Bering Strait to improve the climate of the Northern Hemisphere, turning the snow-covered Arctic Ocean into a vast expanse of green fields; about diverting Siberian rivers southward to irrigate the deserts of Central Asia; about using water from the Tibetan Plateau to transform the Mongolian Gobi Desert. … These inspiring designs are very moving and have resonated with many people around the world.

To understand these epic and heroic design plans, Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Moscow, Li Nan, recently interviewed Markin, an engineer at the Moscow Power Institute. Markin is an expert in Soviet power engineering and is very familiar with these ideal design plans. In front of several large charts of world power resources, Markin carefully introduced the content and significance of these design plans.

Markin pointed out that transforming the climatic conditions of the Northern Hemisphere is the ideal of generations of mankind. The Northern Hemisphere has an area twice the size of Europe that is under the lock of severe cold. The Arctic Ocean, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk are sources of severe cold, and the Arctic Ocean is a huge ice storage cellar.

The Bering Strait is the gateway separating the Eurasian and American continents, connecting the world's largest and warmest Pacific Ocean with the smallest and coldest Arctic Ocean.

As everyone knows, the older generation of Soviet engineers, Shumilin, once proposed building a dam across the Bering Strait, which is only eighty kilometers wide and has an average depth of forty meters. Installing hundreds of powerful pumps driven by nuclear power stations with a capacity of millions of kilowatts on the dam could create a warm current flowing from the Pacific Ocean through the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. This warm current could bring two or three times more heat per year than the total oil reserves in the world could generate. Today, with the widespread use of nuclear energy, this plan is entirely feasible from a technical point of view.

Later, Soviet engineer Borisov proposed a new idea, advocating that the warm currents of the Atlantic be diverted to the Arctic, because the warm currents of the Atlantic are closer to the Arctic Circle than the Pacific, and more warm currents flow to the Arctic region, making it easier to destroy the solid ice of the Arctic Ocean. The warm current could raise the annual average temperature of the Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and the Arctic Ocean, which are connected together, to ten degrees Celsius above zero.

After the temperature of the Arctic Ocean rises, it will cause changes in air currents. Cold waves from the Arctic Ocean will disappear. The Pacific coast and large areas of land close to the Arctic Ocean will warm up. The northern and northeastern regions of the Soviet Union will be relieved of the threat of severe cold and can directly navigate to other oceans in the world through many rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean. The Soviet Union's longest Arctic Ocean coastline will become a prosperous area. And the Arctic Ocean coast of North America, where climatic conditions are even harsher, will benefit even more.

It is estimated that the Bering Strait dam can raise the temperature of the New Siberian Islands by forty degrees, the temperature of Hudson Strait by thirty degrees, and the Bering Strait by fifteen degrees. Even further south, New York, London, Berlin, Moscow, and Vladivostok could also increase by six to ten degrees.

Another noteworthy ideal is that of Soviet hydroelectric engineer Shul'gin, who proposed mobilizing the water flow on the Tibetan Plateau to irrigate Central Asia and the Mongolian Gobi Desert. As everyone knows, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Mekong River, all with abundant water, originate in this area. Shul'gin's proposed design is to dig canals and tunnels in the mountainous areas of the upper reaches of these three rivers, connecting the three rivers, and diverting the surplus water that is not needed downstream to the north.

The combined water flow will pass through the Yellow River valley and divide into two branches. One branch flows northeast, irrigating the eastern part of the Gobi Desert, then flows into the Heilongjiang River basin and into the Sea of Okhotsk. One branch flows northwest, passing through the western part of the Gobi Desert, the Junggar Pass, and connecting with Lake Balkhash in the Soviet Union. These two water flows will form a waterway of up to eight thousand kilometers, connecting the coastal areas of Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union. The water flow here can irrigate, generate electricity, and change the face of the Gobi Desert and the climate of the regions affected by it.

Soviet scientists have also proposed plans to divert some Siberian rivers to flow south and to divert some European rivers that flow north to flow south into the Volga River. Now, these plans are already being practically investigated and designed by scientific research institutions. For example, the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet Hydroelectric Engineering Design Institute is already carrying out the design work of diverting the Pechora River and the Vychegda River from the north to flow into the Volga River. The first to be realized will be the Pechora River flowing into the Volga River through the Kama River.

Engineer Markin finally pointed out that changing the climate of the Northern Hemisphere, especially the Arctic region, is not a fantasy. In thirty or forty years, these ideals will become a reality. The most important thing is to use the power of international cooperation to realize these ideals. Modern engineers should consider international cooperation, at least engineering plans for cooperation between neighboring countries.

### 给北冰洋以温暖  变大戈壁为绿洲  苏联科学家谈改造自然的宏伟计划

    给北冰洋以温暖  变大戈壁为绿洲
    苏联科学家谈改造自然的宏伟计划
    据新华社莫斯科11日电　最近一年多来，许多苏联科学家和工程师经常谈到大规模改造自然的各种大胆宏伟的设计和理想。他们谈到在白令海峡上建筑一座堤坝来改善北半球的气候，使遍地冰雪的北冰洋畔变成绿野千里；谈到叫西伯利亚的河流转向南流，灌溉中亚细亚的沙漠；谈到用西藏高原上的水流改造蒙古的大戈壁。……这些理想的设计是十分动人的，得到了世界上许多人士的反响和共鸣。
    为了了解这些史诗一般的豪迈的设计方案，新华社驻莫斯科记者李楠最近访问了莫斯科动力研究所工程师马尔金。马尔金是苏联动力工程方面的专家，很熟悉这些理想设计方案。马尔金在几幅世界动力资源大挂图面前仔细地介绍了这些设计方案的内容和意义。
    马尔金指出，改造北半球的气候条件，是人类世世代代的理想。北半球有比欧洲大两倍的地区处在严寒的封锁下面。北冰洋、白令海和鄂霍次克海是严寒的来源，北冰洋更是一个巨大的冰库寒窖。
    白令海峡是分隔欧亚和美洲两块大陆的门户，连系着世界上最大的最温暖的太平洋和最小的最寒冷的北冰洋。
    大家知道，苏联老一代的工程师舒米林曾经提出，在宽不过八十公里、平均深度是四十公尺的白令海峡修一座堤坝，在堤坝上安装数百部由功率为数百万瓩的原子能电站带动的强大的唧筒，就可以造成一股由太平洋经过北冰洋流向大西洋的暖流。这种暖流每年可以带来比世界全部石油储量所能发出的热量还要大两、三倍的热量。在原子能得到广泛利用的今天，这个方案就技术上讲是完全可以做到的。
    后来，苏联工程师波里索夫又提出了新的主张，他主张反过来将大西洋暖流引向北极，因为大西洋的暖流比太平洋更接近北极圈，流向北极地带的暖流更多，这样，就更容易摧毁北冰洋的坚冰。暖流可以将连结在一起的白令海、白令海峡、楚克奇海、北冰洋的全年平均温度提高到摄氏零上十度。
    北冰洋的温度提高后，就会引起气流的变化。由北冰洋来的寒潮将会消失。太平洋岸和接近北冰洋的大片陆地就会暖和起来。苏联北部和东北部地带将会解除酷寒的威胁，可以经过许多流向北冰洋的河流直接同世界其他海洋通航。苏联最长的北冰洋海岸将变成一片繁荣的地区。而气候条件更加严酷的北美洲北冰洋沿岸将会得到更大的利益。
    据估计，白令海峡堤坝可以使新西伯利亚群岛的温度提高四十度、赫德逊峡的温度提高三十度、白令海峡提高十五度。甚至更南的纽约、伦敦、柏林、莫斯科、海参崴也可以提高六度到十度。
    另一个值得一提的是苏联的水电工程学家舒尔吉提出的动员西藏高原上的水流来灌溉中亚细亚和蒙古大戈壁的理想。大家知道，水量丰富的长江、黄河、湄公河都是发源于这一地区的。舒尔吉提出的设计就是在这三条河流上游山区开凿运河和隧道，将三条河联系起来，把下游不需要的过剩水量，引向北方。
    联合起来的水流将通过黄河河谷，分成两支。一支流向东北，灌溉大戈壁的东部，再流入黑龙江流域，注入鄂霍次克海。一支流向西北，经过大戈壁的西部、准噶尔山口，和苏联巴尔喀什湖连结起来。这两支水流将组成长达八千公里的航道，把哈萨克、中国、蒙古、苏联滨海区域连结起来。这里的水流可以灌溉、发电，并且改变大戈壁的面貌和受它影响的地区的气候。
    苏联的科学家们还提出了使西伯利亚的一些河流改向南流，使欧洲部分一些向北流的河流南流入伏尔加河的方案。现在，这些方案已经有科学研究机关在从事实际的考察和设计了。例如，苏联水电工程设计院列宁格勒分院已经在进行使彼乔拉河、麦晋河从北方转向流入伏尔加河的设计工作。最先实现的将是彼乔拉河经过卡马河流入伏尔加河。
    马尔金工程师最后指出，改变北半球的气候，特别是北极地区的气候，这并不是幻想。三、四十年后，这些理想就会变成现实。最重要的是要用国际合作的力量来实现这些理想。现代的工程学家应该考虑到国际合作，至少是相邻的国家相互合作的工程计划。
