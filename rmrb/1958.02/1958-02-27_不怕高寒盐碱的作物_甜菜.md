Crops That Fear Neither Cold, Altitude, Nor Salinity – Sugar Beets

Sugar beet, also called sugar radish or "g疙瘩" [lumps], is the main raw material for the sugar industry in the north. Sugar beet belongs to the Chenopodiaceae family, Beta genus, and is a variety of the cultivated beet species. Besides this variety, there are also several other varieties such as fodder beet. Sugar beet (hereinafter referred to as beet) is a very resilient crop that yields better harvests than other field crops under poor soil and climate conditions.

Sugar beets are grown in the northern part of Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and parts of Southwest and Northwest China. According to statistics from agricultural departments, the national sugar beet cultivation area in 1956 was more than 2.2 million mu.

In recent years, many regions have been experimenting with sugar beet cultivation. Trial cultivation shows that sugar beets also grow very well in some high-altitude mountainous areas in Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other provinces. In the mountainous areas of Enshi Prefecture, Hubei, the yield of beet roots was 2,500 jin per mu last year, with large-scale high yields reaching 8,000 jin, and the sugar content generally around 11%.

Trial cultivation in various places also shows that sugar beets are highly resistant to salinity. In the saline-alkali lands of Inner Mongolia, Yanbei in Shanxi, and Yinchuan in Gansu, yields of beet roots can reach 2,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, some even higher than yields in non-saline areas.

How profitable is sugar beet cultivation? If each hectare of sugar beet produces 40,000 jin of beet roots, each hectare can yield 6,000 to 8,000 jin of sugar, 20,000 jin of beet stems and leaves, and 36,000 jin of beet pulp after sugar extraction. Beet stems, leaves, and beet pulp are all excellent livestock feed. The feeding value of dried beet pulp is similar to that of grain feed. It has also been calculated that if each mu produces 3,000 jin of sugar beets, 360 jin of sugar can be produced, 32.5 jin of liquor can be brewed from waste molasses, and the by-products are enough to feed more than one pig. From this, it can be seen that the economic significance of developing this crop is significant.

Although China's current sugar beet planting area has expanded seven or eight times compared to 1949, it still cannot meet the needs. To further develop this production, agricultural departments and others have planned to expand and trial plant sugar beets in 760,000 mu across the country this year, and correspondingly establish 1,800 handicraft sugar factories and 20 semi-mechanized sugar factories. Judging from the enthusiasm of some regions in developing this crop since last winter and this spring, this target is very likely to fall behind the planning figures in various regions.

The "Youyi" [Friendship] sugar beet planted in major sugar beet producing areas such as Northeast China and Inner Mongolia was introduced from Poland after liberation. Its original name was "Bus·P", and "Youyi" [Friendship] sugar beet was named by China. The sugar content of this variety's beet roots is as high as 18%-20% in Jilin, and its resistance to leaf spot disease is also relatively strong. Some sugar beet areas in China are now able to breed seeds themselves, and the situation of relying on imports for sugar beet seeds has begun to change. In 1957, the national self-bred sugar beet seeds totaled more than 1,000 tons.

### 不怕高寒盐碱的作物——甜菜

    不怕高寒盐碱的作物——甜菜
    糖甜菜也叫糖萝卜、疙瘩，是北方制糖工业的主要原料。糖甜菜属于藜科，甜菜属，甜菜栽培种的一个变种。除这个变种以外，还有饲料甜菜等几个变种。糖甜菜（以下称甜菜）是一种抗逆性很强的作物，在比较差的土质、气候等条件下，比其他大田作物有较好的收成。
    我国东北区北部、内蒙古、西南和西北部分地区都种植甜菜。据农业部门统计，1956年全国甜菜栽培面积有二百二十多万亩。
    近几年来不少地区在试种甜菜。从试种情况看，甜菜在湖北、四川、陕西、山西等省部分高寒山区生长得也很好。湖北恩施专区山地栽培的甜菜，去年每亩产块根二千五百斤，大面积高产的达到八千斤，含糖率一般在11％左右。
    各地试种的情况还表明，甜菜抗盐碱的能力很强。在内蒙古、山西雁北、甘肃银川等地的含有盐碱的土地上，每亩能收到菜根二千斤到五千斤，有些甚至高于非盐碱地区的产量。
    栽培甜菜的收益究竟有多大？如果每公顷甜菜产块根四万斤，每公顷就可以得到六千到八千斤糖，二万斤甜菜茎叶和三万六千斤榨糖后的废菜丝。甜菜茎叶和废菜丝都是很好的牲畜饲料。干废菜丝的饲养价值和谷物饲料相近。也有人这样计算过：如果每亩产甜菜三千斤，就可以制出三百六十斤糖，废糖蜜可以酿酒三十二斤半，副产物足够喂养一头多猪。由此可以知道，发展这项作物的经济意义是很大的。
    我国现在的甜菜种植面积虽然比1949年扩大了七、八倍，但是还不能适应需要。为了进一步发展这项生产，农业等部门曾计划在今年各地扩种、试种甜菜七十六万亩，相应地建立手工业糖厂一千八百个，半机械化糖厂二十个。从去冬今春一些地区发展这种作物的劲头看，这个指标很有可能落在各地规划数字的后面。
    我国东北、内蒙古等主要甜菜产区种植的“友谊”甜菜，是解放以后由波兰引进的，它的原名“Bus·P”，“友谊”甜菜是我国命名的。这个品种块根的含糖率在吉林高达18％—20％，抗褐斑病的能力也较强。我国部分甜菜区已能自己繁育种子，甜菜种子一向依靠进口的情况开始有了变化。1957年全国自繁的甜菜种子已有一千多吨。
