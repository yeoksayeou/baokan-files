At the Banquet Hosted by Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang
Premier Zhou's Speech

Dear Premier Comrade, dear comrades and friends:

Tomorrow we will conclude our visit to your country. During our visit, the grand welcome and warm reception given to us by the Korean government and the Korean people are something we will never be able to express enough gratitude for. We will never forget every moment we spent with the Korean people during the past week.

Although our visit was not long, thanks to the very thoughtful arrangements made by the Korean government, we have gained a relatively concrete understanding of your work in various fields. After this visit, the heroic image of the Korean people has become clearer and more profound in our minds. We have seen the diligence and perseverance shown by the Korean people in building socialism. We have seen the Korean people's confidence and ideals for the future.

Yesterday, when visiting the Sangyang Agricultural Production Cooperative, we met a respectable old lady whose entire family had been killed by the American aggressors. She took my hand and said that she was already sixty-five years old, but in order to build a better socialist life, she wanted to live even longer. Listen, this is the heroic voice of the Korean people!

Today, at the Hwanghae Iron Works, the directors of two workshops told us that during the difficult war years, hundreds of workers, disregarding the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, heroically maintained the equipment of these two workshops with selfless spirit. We have seen with our own eyes that the Hwanghae Iron Works not only still stands, but is also constantly expanding. This is the most vivid symbol of the indomitable spirit of the heroic Korean people.

On the eve of our departure, I would like to assure you that we will bring the great brotherly friendship of the Korean people back to the Chinese people. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I now wish the Korean people new and continuous victories in the cause of building socialism and in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and Premier Kim Il-sung.

Comrades, friends, I propose a toast:

To the health of Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung!

To the health of Comrade Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly!

To the fraternal and everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

To the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

To the great unity of the people of the world!

    在乔晓光大使举行的宴会上
    周总理的讲话亲爱的首相同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    明天我们就要结束在你们的国家里的访问。在我们进行访问的期间，朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民所给予我们的盛大欢迎和亲切接待，是我们无论如何也感激不尽的。我们将永远不会忘记在过去的一星期里我们同朝鲜人民欢聚在一起的每个时刻。
    虽然我们访问的时间并不长，但是，由于朝鲜政府做了十分周到的安排，我们对于你们各方面的工作都有了比较具体的了解。经过这次访问，朝鲜人民英雄的形象在我们的脑子里变得更加显明，更加深刻。我们看到了朝鲜人民在建设社会主义中所表现出来的勤劳和毅力。我们看到了朝鲜人民对未来的信心和理想。
    昨天，在参观上阳农业生产合作社的时候，我们遇到一位可敬的老大娘，她所有的亲人都遭到美国侵略者的杀害。她拉着我的手说，她已经六十五岁了，但是为了建设更加美好的社会主义生活，她还要活得更长。请听吧，这就是英雄的朝鲜人民发出来的豪迈的声音！
    今天，在黄海制铁所，两个车间的主任告诉我们，在艰苦的战争时期，几百个工人不顾敌人的狂轰滥炸，用忘我的精神英勇地护维这两个车间的设备。我们亲眼看到黄海制铁所不仅仍然屹立着，而且正在不断扩大。这是英雄的朝鲜人民不屈不挠的精神的最生动的象征。
    当我们将要同你们分别的前夕，我愿意向你们保证我们一定会把朝鲜人民兄弟般的伟大友谊带回给中国人民。我现在代表中国政府和中国人民，祝朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相的领导下在建设社会主义的事业中和和平统一祖国的斗争中取得新的、不断的胜利。
    同志们、朋友们，我建议
    为内阁首相金日成同志的健康，
    为最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健同志的健康，
    为中朝两国人民兄弟般的、万古长青的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，
    为世界人民大团结，干杯！
