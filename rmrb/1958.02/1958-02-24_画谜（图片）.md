    Picture Puzzle
    When drawing, attention should be paid to selecting the angle. Here is a clumsy painter who has created eleven sketches from the worst possible angles. Although his paintings are quite similar, it is difficult for others to appreciate them. Can you understand what he has drawn? (Answers will be provided on today's edition.)

    画画儿应该注意选择角度。这里是一位拙劣的画家，从最不好的角度画出来的十一幅写生画。尽管他画得也很像，可是别人欣赏起来却是困难的。你能看懂他画的是一些什么吗？（画题在今日本版）
