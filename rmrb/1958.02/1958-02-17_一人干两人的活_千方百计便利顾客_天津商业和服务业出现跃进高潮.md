Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 16th: Encouraged by the revolutionary spirit-filled initiative proposed by the workers of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store and the Mi Shi Da Jie Non-staple Food Store, commercial and service industry workers in Tianjin's department stores, vegetable markets, cotton cloth stores, grain stores, restaurants, barbershops, bathhouses, and other industries are full of energy and have begun a great leap forward upsurge.

In the past few days, leading cadres and workers in many commercial units have been working day and night to study and formulate targets and guarantees for responding to the initiative. The workers of the Huangjia Garden Department Store, recently selected as a 1957 Tianjin Model Store, in addition to responding to the initiative of the Tianqiao Department Store, also launched an initiative to start a competition among commercial workers throughout the city.

When studying and formulating targets for responding to the initiative, many store workers believed that commercial workers have great potential and that a large number of people can be transferred to support industrial and agricultural production. The workers of the Huangjia Garden Department Store decided to reduce fourteen people from the existing thirty-five, a reduction of 40%; and to change the current cross-work system to a "one shift to the end" system. The workers of the Tianxiangchi Bathhouse also broke the usual operating hours.

The workers proposed that after the personnel reduction, they should give full play to their revolutionary enthusiasm, one person doing the work of two, actively promoting sales of goods, expanding sales revenue, and saving expenses. The workers of the Huangjia Garden Department Store carefully calculated that they would increase the average daily sales revenue per person from 44 yuan to 91 yuan, increasing work efficiency by 107%. The North Station Department Store decided to accelerate the turnover of funds, accelerating the turnover rate from 3.14 times last year to 7 times, and reducing the funds occupied by commodities from 300,000 yuan last year to 200,000 yuan. The Women and Children's Goods Store proposed that this year's expenses be reduced by 1.58% compared to last year, saving the state 10,000 yuan.

In the guarantee conditions for responding to the initiative, many store workers have set out methods to facilitate customers. The workers of the Yongjuxing Restaurant in Nankai District, in order to completely eliminate the phenomenon of customers queuing for breakfast, made preparations in advance the afternoon before, increasing the number of people and stalls selling breakfast. Many vegetable and grocery stores in Hexi District established a system of selling goods on duty at night, dispatched mobile sales vehicles to workers' dormitories during the day to promote sales, and regularly delivered goods to the homes of the elderly and widowed.

    一人干两人的活　千方百计便利顾客
    天津商业和服务业出现跃进高潮
    据新华社天津16日电　天津市百货、蔬菜、棉布、粮食、饮食、理发、澡堂等各行各业的商业和服务业工作者，在北京天桥百货商场和米市大街副食品商店职工提出的充满革命精神的倡议鼓舞下，干劲十足，开始出现大跃进的高潮。
    几天来，许多商业单位的领导干部和职工一起，夜以继日地开会研究制订响应倡议的指标和保证条件。最近当选为1957年天津市模范门市部的百货公司黄家花园门市部的职工，除响应天桥百货商店的倡议外，还向全市商业职工发起了开展竞赛的倡议。
    很多商店的职工在研究制订响应倡议的指标时，认为商业工作人员潜力大，可以调出大批人力支援工农业生产。黄家花园百货门市部的职工决定从现有的三十五人中减去十四人，减少40％；改变目前的交叉工作制为“一班顶到底”。天香池澡堂的职工也打破过去营业时间的常规。
    职工们提出在人员减少后要发挥革命干劲，一个人干两个人的工作，积极推销商品，扩大卖钱额，节省费用开支。黄家花园百货门市部的职工算了细账，要把每人每天平均四十四元的卖钱额提高到九十一元，工作效率提高107％。北站百货门市部决定加速资金周转，周转速度由去年的三·一四次加速到七次，商品占用的资金由去年的三十万元减少到二十万元。妇女儿童用品商店提出今年的费用开支比去年降低1.58％，为国家节省开支一万元。
    许多商店的职工在响应倡议的保证条件中，订出了便利顾客的办法。南开区永聚兴饮食店的职工为了彻底消灭顾客吃早点排队的现象，在前一天下午提前做好准备工作，增加出售早点的人员和摊位。河西区许多蔬菜杂货门市部建立晚上值班售货的制度，白天出动流动售货车到职工宿舍推销，并且定期给孤寡户送货上门。
