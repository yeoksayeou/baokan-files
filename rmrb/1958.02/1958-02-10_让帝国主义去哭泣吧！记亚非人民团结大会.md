Let the Imperialists Weep!
A Record of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference
Wang Li

　　On the day the Cairo conference closed, an American reporter said with disappointment, "This conference has no big news, no quarrels, no ruptures, it's simply one-sided."

　　That's the truth. Nearly fifty countries from Asia and Africa with different social systems, and more than five hundred representatives from different social strata, political views, and religious beliefs, gathered together to discuss the urgent issues of the Asian and African people and major international issues in a very harmonious manner. Indeed, there were "no quarrels, no ruptures." On the issue of opposing imperialism, it was indeed "one-sided." Furthermore, on the basis of promoting the Bandung spirit, many major agreements were reached. For the imperialists, this was indeed "no big news." But for the Asian and African people, this is the biggest and most thrilling news.

　　I remember an interesting dialogue. An American reporter asked, "Why is it that throughout this conference, you only criticize the West?" A Chinese representative responded, "This is because your government has done things from beginning to end that deserve criticism from the Asian and African people. Who else should we criticize?"

　　This is also the truth. The biggest feature of this conference is the unanimous opposition to imperialism from beginning to end, truly worthy of being called a referendum of the Asian and African people. The result of the referendum shows that not only is the old-brand British and French imperialism rotten and moldy, but the new-brand American imperialism is also stinking. At this conference, they both received zero votes.

　　The unanimous adoption of opposition to the Eisenhower Doctrine formed the climax of the conference. When the chairman of the conference announced that the head of the Tunisian delegation proposed to change "opposing the Eisenhower Doctrine" to "opposing the American vacuum theory," it was immediately met with unanimous and stern questioning from Arab countries: "In the Near and Middle Eastern countries, the Eisenhower Doctrine is a well-known and deeply hated bad doctrine, why change it to another term?" When the Tunisian delegation later expressed its withdrawal of this proposal, thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue.

　　Supporting the national independence and liberation movements of the African people was the focus of this conference. At this conference, African countries accounted for the majority. More than half of all African countries attended this conference. The names of many countries are unfamiliar in international conferences. They stepped onto the stage of international political struggle for the first time and showed great prowess.

　　Africa, under the strict blockade and isolation of imperialism, is called the "mysterious continent." Its area accounts for one-fifth of the entire land area on Earth. Colonialists seriously began vying for Africa in the 1870s. After about thirty years, by the beginning of this century, in the words of the imperialists, "Africa was divided like a watermelon." In less than a century, the towering crimes of the colonialists in Africa far exceeded the sum of the crimes of all tyrants in human history.

　　Old-brand imperialists are still stubbornly clinging to their outdated views, desperately holding on to their last rear. Many "maxims" that are even more barbaric than the black language used by robbers when killing and looting: "Africa is me," "Africa, I hold you firmly!" "All of Africa and its treasures are ours," "If blacks are allowed equal opportunities, whites cannot survive," "Blacks do not need a home, they can sleep under a tree," etc., are still used by imperialists as the theoretical basis for ruling Africa.

　　Listen to the voices of the African people! Look at the current state of the African people's struggle! Moumié, Chairman of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, announced in a report on colonialism: "Everywhere in the wilds of Africa, from Port Elizabeth to Nairobi, passing through Tananarive to Ifni, passing through Mounono, Yaoundé, Alitienne and Gankan in French Guinea, the people are rising up!" The greedy colonialists often say, "African diamonds are cash cows, and gems are eternal," but the colonial system is by no means eternal. In Asia and Africa, it has already gone halfway to the grave, and the day it enters the tomb completely is indeed not far away.

　　When African representatives and Chinese representatives fraternize and chat, they always say that Mao Zedong and Nasser are the figures they respect the most. They admire Mao Zedong's two maxims the most: one is "The East wind prevails over the West wind," and the other is "Imperialism is a paper tiger." From their long experience, they can easily understand: "Imperialism is like a candle, it won't shine if you don't light it," "Imperialism is like garbage, it won't leave the house if you don't sweep it out." From the example of the Egyptian people defeating British and French imperialism, they understand that the real strongman is the African people, and that imperialism is not terrible and can be completely driven away. Due to the imperialist blockade, many of them only recently learned that China had been liberated and that the American imperialists had been defeated before the Chinese people's horses, which further encouraged their confidence in the victory of the struggle.

　　Originally, the US conspiracy to replace Britain and France was as obvious as "Sima Zhao's heart, known to all on the road," but it still put on a hypocritical face and appeared as the savior of the Near and Middle East and Africa, which had also confused the vision of some people. We should thank the proponents of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for so quickly and nakedly exposing the ferocious face of American imperialism. In the report on imperialism by Egyptian representative Mohieddin, it was pointed out that the Eisenhower Doctrine is "assistance with political, military and economic ropes." He hit the nail on the head about the essence of this "doctrine." He said: "The policy of contemporary imperialism is to waver between suddenly going mad and launching aggression from the outside, and suddenly using political conspiracies and creating coups to subvert nationally independent governments, as well as applying pressure and economic blockades as preparatory means to launch internal attacks." It is no wonder that American politicians lamented: "We will lose Africa, just like we lost China." They even arrogantly regarded Africa as something in America's pocket, which is the theoretical basis for their proposal to fill the "vacuum." Our friend, Indian representative Dr. Anup Singh, said it well: The "vacuum" that needs to be filled is probably the minds of the imperialists. Dr. Guo Moruo also added well, saying that the minds of the imperialists are not "vacuum," but are filled with selfish and greedy dirty views. Both of these remarks won applause from the audience.

　　The East is just like the rising sun, and the East has awakened. This conference fully demonstrated that today is the era when Easterners control their own destiny, and it also shows that Easterners will play a major role in protecting world peace, which is related to the destiny of mankind. The conference unanimously condemned the Paris Conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, condemned the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty, supported the peace proposals of the Soviet government, firmly advocated prohibiting the testing, production and use of nuclear weapons, and firmly advocated that Asian and African countries should become areas that do not accept foreign nuclear weapons and missiles. The conference reiterated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, and the conference expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the United Nations, which cannot fully represent the people of Asia and Africa. A series of resolutions passed by the conference further proved that the national independence and liberation movement forces of the Asian and African people belong to the forces that defend world peace, and belong to the forces of the East wind.

　　The seeds of friendship between the Asian and African people sown at the Bandung Conference blossomed and bore fruit at the Cairo Conference. The conference made a resolution to develop economic and cultural exchanges on the basis of opposing the imperialist blockade, equality and mutual benefit. At the conference, people addressed each other as brothers. For countries that have not yet achieved independence, people congratulated them on winning independence soon; for countries that have already achieved independence, people congratulated them on consolidating their independent status and congratulated their countries on prosperity and strength. In the economic report, the Soviet delegation proposed that it was willing to provide economic, financial and technical assistance to Asian and African countries without any conditions attached, and used the assistance to Egypt and Syria as an example. This became a sharp contrast with the imperialist noose-style assistance and received the warmest welcome from the conference.

　　The success of the Cairo Conference is inseparable from the support and assistance of the host Egyptians. If someone asks, what is the biggest support of the Egyptians for the conference? My answer is that the fighting spirit of the Egyptians in defeating the British and French imperialists a year ago is the greatest support for the Cairo Conference.

　　This is a clear impression that I had as soon as I arrived in Cairo. Every Egyptian we met, when mentioning imperialism, would always roll up his sleeves and call for a fight; when mentioning the War of Resistance, he would always be beaming; when mentioning Nasser, he would always call him a hero; when mentioning China, he would always say: "You helped us when we were in the most difficult time, we are good brothers."

　　We can see it more clearly at the mass rally celebrating the first anniversary of the liberation of Port Said. This is not so much a solemn military parade as a review of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of Port Said and the people of Egypt. The majestic army, equipped with jets and giant tanks, certainly cheered the friends and frightened the enemies, but what cheered the friends even more and frightened the enemies should be the ranks of children under the age of ten, elderly grandmothers and grandpas, young girls and women, especially the fighting heroes among them. When we went to the Martyrs' Cemetery to protect Port Said to present wreaths, Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, said after a silent prayer: "The heroes used their own blood to force the last soldier of the imperialists to finally withdraw from Port Said. Let us continue to force the last soldier of the imperialists to withdraw from the land of all colonies on earth!"

　　The Egyptians have set a brilliant example for the national independence and liberation movements of the people of the Near and Middle East and Africa. Subsequently, the Syrians struck at the conspiracy of Turkish and Israeli aggression arranged by American imperialism. Since the Egyptians and Syrians can achieve victory through struggle, then other people in the Near and Middle East and Africa can also achieve victory through struggle. This kind of encouragement can be obtained from every city in Egypt, especially from every corner of Cairo. During the conference, Cairo was dressed in festive attire, but what made her deeply touching was mainly that her soul permeated the spirit of fighting against imperialism.

　　The Chinese delegation was warmly received by the Egyptian hosts during the conference. The scenery of winter in Egypt is pleasant, and both sides of the Nile are still lush and full of greenery. Egyptians have a famous saying: "Whoever has drunk the water of the Nile, even if he goes far away, will have to come back to drink it three times." Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, said at the reception hosted by the mayor of Cairo, "Not just three times, but a thousand and one times!" He also welcomed Egyptian friends to drink the water of the Yangtze River more than once. This sentence expresses the deep friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people.

　　If the national independence and liberation movements of the vast majority of Asian countries have gained the fruits of victory; if the national independence and liberation movement in Latin America is still "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind is filling the building," then the national independence and liberation movement in Africa is exactly "the sound of rain is coming from across the forest." Let the imperialists weep!

　　让帝国主义去哭泣吧！
　　记亚非人民团结大会
　　王力
    在开罗会议闭幕的那一天，一位美国记者充满失望的心情说道：“这个会议没有大新闻，没有争吵，没有破裂，简直是一边倒。”
    这倒是实话。亚非两洲将近五十个不同社会制度的国家，五百多位不同社会地位、政治观念和宗教信仰的代表，欢聚一堂，十分融洽的讨论了亚非人民的紧迫问题和重大的国际问题，的确是“没有争吵，没有破裂”。在反对帝国主义的问题上也的确是“一边倒”。并且在发扬万隆精神的基础上，达成了许多重大的协议。这对于帝国主义者说来，也的确是“没有大新闻”。但是对于亚非人民说来，这就是最大的惊心动魄的新闻。
    我还记得一段有趣的对话。一位美国记者问道：“在这个会议上，为什么从头到尾都是骂西方？”一位中国代表应声答道：“这是因为你们的政府对待亚非人民从头到尾作的都是挨骂的事，不骂它还骂谁？”
    这也是实话。这个会议的最大特点就是从头到尾异口同声的反对帝国主义，真称得起是一次亚非人民的民意测验。测验的结果表明，不但老牌的英法帝国主义早已臭得发霉，新牌的美帝国主义也是腐臭的了。在这个会议上，他们都是零票。
    全体一致通过反对艾森豪威尔主义，形成了会议的最高潮。当大会主席宣布突尼斯代表团团长提议要把“反对艾森豪威尔主义”修改为“反对美国真空地带论”的时候，立即遭到阿拉伯国家一致严正的质问：“在中近东国家中，艾森豪威尔主义已是妇孺皆知的、恨之入骨的坏主义，为什么要变换另外的名词呢？”当后来突尼斯代表团表示撤回这个提议时，全场响起了春雷般的掌声。
    支持非洲人民的民族独立解放运动，是这次会议的重点。在这个会议上，非洲国家占多数。全非洲有一半以上的国家出席了这个会议。许多国家的名字，在国际会议上是陌生的，他们第一次登上国际政治斗争的舞台，并且大显身手。
    非洲在帝国主义严密封锁隔绝之下被人称作“神秘的大陆”。它的面积占地球上整个陆地面积的五分之一。殖民主义者认真开始争夺非洲是在十九世纪七十年代。大概经过了三十年，到本世纪初，拿帝国主义者的话来说：“非洲就像一个西瓜般地被瓜分了”。在不到一个世纪的年代中，殖民主义者在非洲的滔天罪行远远超过了人类历史上一切暴君的罪行的总和。
    老牌帝国主义还在顽固地凭借着陈腐不堪的观点，死守着他们最后的后方。许多比强盗在杀人越货时所说的黑话更野蛮的“格言”：“非洲即我”，“非洲，我牢牢地抓住你”！“全部非洲和它的珍奇之物都是我们的”，“如果允许黑人有平等机会，白人就不能生存下去”，“黑人不需要家，他可以在树底下睡觉”等等，至今仍被帝国主义者作为统治非洲的理论根据。
    听听非洲人民的声音吧！看看非洲人民的斗争现状吧！喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米在关于殖民主义的报告中宣布：“在非洲到处林莽的地方，从伊丽莎白港到内罗毕，经过塔那那利佛到伊夫尼，经过麦诺诺、耶昂特洛姆、阿利琴和法属几内亚的甘坎，人民都在揭竿而起了”。贪婪的殖民主义者常常说：“非洲的钻石是摇钱树，宝石是永恒的”，但是，殖民主义制度绝不是永恒的。在亚非两洲，它已经大半截下土了，全部进入坟墓的日子，的确是不远了。
    当非洲代表和中国代表一起联欢和闲谈的时候，他们总是说，毛泽东和纳赛尔是他们最尊敬的人物。他们最欣赏毛泽东的两句格言：一句是“东风压倒西风”，还有一句：“帝国主义是纸老虎”。他们从长期经历中非常容易懂得：“帝国主义好比蜡烛，不点不亮”，“帝国主义好比垃圾，不扫除不出屋门”。他们从埃及人民击败英法帝国主义的事例中，懂得了真正的强者是非洲人民，而帝国主义并不可怕，完全是可以赶走的。由于帝国主义的封锁，他们中间许多人是不久前才知道中国已经获得解放，并且知道了美帝国主义者曾经在中国人民的马前败退，这就更加鼓舞了他们斗争胜利的信心。
    本来，美国取英法而代之的阴谋是如同“司马昭之心，路人皆知”，但是它还是装出伪善的面孔，以中近东和非洲救世主的姿态出现的，这也曾经迷惑了一些人的视觉。应该感谢“艾森豪威尔主义”的倡导者，因为它如此迅速地赤裸裸地暴露出美帝国主义的狰狞面目。在埃及代表毛希丁关于帝国主义的报告中，就指出了艾森豪威尔主义就是“附有政治、军事和经济绳子的援助”。他一语道破了这个“主义”的实质。他说：“当代帝国主义的政策，就是徘徊犹豫于一下子发逞疯狂，从外部发动侵略，又一下子通过政治阴谋，制造政变来颠复民族独立政府，以及施加压力和经济封锁，作为准备手段，来发动内部进攻。”这就难怪美国政客们哀鸣：“我们将丧失非洲，像丧失中国一样”。他们竟蛮横地把非洲当作为美国的囊中之物，这也就是他们提出要填补“真空”的理论根据。我们的朋友印度代表阿努普·辛格博士说得好：恐怕要填补的“真空”，倒是帝国主义者的头脑。郭沫若博士也补充得好，他说帝国主义者的脑子并不是“真空”，而是充满着自私和贪婪的肮脏观点。这两个人的话，都博得全场鼓掌。
    东方正如同初升的旭日，东方觉醒起来了。这一次会议充分表现了今天已是东方人掌握自己命运的时代，也表现出东方人将在关系人类命运的保卫世界和平的问题上起着重大的作用。会议一致谴责了北大西洋公约集团国家的巴黎会议，谴责了马尼拉条约和巴格达条约，会议支持了苏联政府的和平建议，坚决主张禁止核子武器的试验、生产和使用，坚决主张亚非各国应成为不接受外国核武器和导弹的地区，会议重申了和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则，会议对联合国目前这种不能充分代表亚非人民的现状表示了不满。会议通过的一系列决议更加证明了亚非人民的民族独立解放运动力量是属于保卫世界和平这方面的力量，是属于东风方面的力量。
    万隆会议种下的亚非人民友谊的种子，在开罗会议上开了花，结了果。会议作出了在反对帝国主义封锁和平等互利的基础上，发展经济和文化交流的决议。在会议上，人们都以兄弟相称。对于尚未独立的国家，人们祝贺他们早日争取独立；对于已经取得独立的国家，人们祝贺他们巩固自己的独立地位，祝贺他们的国家繁荣昌盛。苏联代表团在经济报告中，提出愿意不附带任何条件，对亚非国家提供经济、财政和技术援助，并且以对埃及和叙利亚的援助作为范例，这同帝国主义的绞绳式的援助成为鲜明的对照，受到了大会最热烈的欢迎。
    开罗会议的成功，和会议的东道主埃及人的支持和协助是分不开的。如果有人问，埃及人对会议最大的支持是什么？我的回答是，一年前埃及人举国一致，战胜英法帝国主义者的战斗精神，是对开罗会议的最大支持。
    这一点，是我一到达开罗市就产生的鲜明的印象。我们遇到的每一个埃及人，一提起帝国主义，总是卷起袖子叫打；一提到抗战，总是眉飞色舞；一提起纳赛尔，总是称之为英雄好汉；提到中国的时候，也总是说：“你们在我们最困难的时候，帮助了我们，我们是好兄弟。”
    我们在庆祝塞得港光复一周年纪念的群众大会上可以看得更加清楚。这与其说是一个庄严的阅兵大会，不如说是一个塞得港人民和埃及人民反帝斗争的检阅大会。雄伟的军队，装备着喷气机和巨型坦克，固然使朋友们振奋，使敌人胆寒，但更加使朋友们振奋，使敌人胆寒的，应该是不足十岁的孩子们、年迈的老太太和老伯伯们、年轻的姑娘们和妇女们的行列，特别是他们中间的战斗英雄们。当我们到保卫塞得港烈士公墓敬献花圈的时候，郭沫若团长在默祷之后说：“英雄们用自己的血，逼迫帝国主义者的最后一兵终于退出了塞得港，让我们继续逼迫帝国主义者的最后一兵退出地球上所有的殖民地的土地吧！”
    埃及人为中近东和非洲人民的民族的独立解放运动树立了光辉的榜样。接着，叙利亚人又打击了美帝国主义所布置的土耳其和以色列进犯的阴谋。既然埃及人和叙利亚人能够经过斗争取得胜利，那么，其他的中近东人和非洲人也同样能够经过斗争取得胜利。这种鼓舞，人们可以从埃及的每一个城市、特别是从开罗的每一个角落里得到。在开会期间，开罗市是节日盛装的打扮，但是她之所以感人很深，主要还是她的灵魂渗透着反对帝国主义的战斗的精神。
    中国代表团在开会期间，受到了埃及主人的友谊接待。埃及冬天的景色是宜人的，尼罗河两岸还是苍翠满园。埃及人有一句有名的谚语：“谁要是喝过尼罗河的水，即使走远了，还要回来喝三次”。郭沫若团长在开罗市长的招待酒会上说，“何止三次，应当是一千零一次！”他并且欢迎埃及朋友不止一次地来喝喝扬子江的水。这句话表达了中埃人民深厚的友情。
    如果说，亚洲绝大多数国家的民族独立解放运动已经得到胜利的果实的话；如果说，拉丁美洲的民族独立解放运动还是“山雨欲来风满楼”的话，那么，非洲的民族独立解放运动正是“雨声一片隔林来”。让帝国主义去哭泣吧！（附图片）
