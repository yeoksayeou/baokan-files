Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 20th: The Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a statement on February 20, 1958, the full text of which is as follows:

    On February 5, 1958, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement putting forward various proposals for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea. These proposals not only conform to the interests of all the Korean people and the people of all countries participating in the Korean War, but will also open up new and realistic ways to ease the tense situation in the Far East. On February 7, 1958, the Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement supporting the Korean government's proposals and expressing its readiness to consult with the Korean government on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea. All officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fully agree with and warmly support the statements of the Chinese and Korean governments. After consultations with the Korean government, our government has proposed to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that it take the initiative to withdraw completely from Korea. All officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fully agree with our government's proposal and have decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, with the first batch to be completed before April 30. The joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments on February 19, 1958, has already announced this decision of our army. Now, we also demand that the United States and other countries participating in the United Nations forces take similar measures and withdraw all their troops from South Korea without delay, in order to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of tensions in the Far East.

    It has been seven years and three months since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea on October 25, 1950, to fight alongside the Korean People's Army against the aggression of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people are peace-loving. Only when the U.S. government launched the war of aggression against Korea, while at the same time occupying our territory of Taiwan, and disregarded the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, brazenly crossing the 38th parallel and seriously threatening our country's security, did the Chinese people find it unbearable and launched the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, forming the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, coming to Korea to cooperate with the Korean People's Army to resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism. Together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, we faced an unprecedentedly brutal enemy under extremely difficult conditions. After nearly three years of heroic struggle, we finally repelled the invasion of the aggressive forces headed by U.S. imperialism, driving the enemy back to where they originally launched the war - the 38th parallel, forcing them to stop the war. After the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, strictly abided by all the provisions of the armistice agreement, opposed the U.S. side's constant plots and actions to undermine the armistice agreement, and waged a resolute struggle to maintain the armistice and defend peace. At the same time, all officers and men of our army, during their stationing period, also assisted the Korean people in rebuilding their peaceful life.

    The righteous actions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have been warmly embraced and fully supported by the people of China and Korea from the very beginning, and have received the deep sympathy and broad support of all peace-loving people in the world. This has made it possible for us to fulfill the sacred mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country, and not to fail the trust of the entire Chinese people. Our struggle and efforts have made due contributions to stopping aggression and defending peace. This is the glory of the Chinese people and the glory of all officers and men of our army. The martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, and will be remembered forever!

    During the more than seven years that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been in Korea, we have shared hardships and difficulties with the Korean people, lived and fought together, and forged a brotherly friendship as close as flesh and blood. At the same time, practice has also made us more deeply realize the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Chinese and Korean people, who are as interdependent as lips and teeth and share weal and woe, and realize the truth that resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is protecting our homes and defending our country. Over the past seven years, this fighting friendship between our army and the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, which has been forged with blood, is eternal and unbreakable. We will also always remember the love, support, and care given to our army by the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic People's

    今年全部撤出朝鲜　四月底撤完第一批
    志愿军总部发表声明
    要求美国和其他国家军队同样全部撤出朝鲜
    如果美帝国主义胆敢再次发动侵朝战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国的优秀儿女将再一次跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民一起粉碎敌人的进犯。
    新华社平壤20日电　中国人民志愿军总部1958年2月20日发表声明，全文如下：
    1958年2月5日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表声明提出了立即从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和实现朝鲜和平统一的各项建议。这些建议不仅符合全朝鲜人民和所有参加朝鲜战争的各国人民的利益，而且也将为和缓远东紧张局势开辟新的现实的途径。1958年2月7日，中华人民共和国政府发表声明，支持朝鲜政府的建议，并且表示准备就中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的问题同朝鲜政府进行磋商。中国人民志愿军全体官兵完全赞成并且热烈支持朝中两国政府的声明。我国政府在经过同朝鲜政府磋商后，向中国人民志愿军提出了主动从朝鲜全部撤出的建议。中国人民志愿军全体官兵完全赞同我国政府的建议，决定于1958年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批将于4月30日前撤完。朝中两国政府1958年2月19日的联合声明已经宣布了我军的这一决定。现在，我们同时也要求美国和参加联合国军的其他各国，同样采取措施，毫不拖延地把自己的军队全部撤出南朝鲜，以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决和远东紧张局势的和缓。
    自从中国人民志愿军于1950年10月25日进入朝鲜，同朝鲜人民军并肩作战抵抗美帝国主义的侵略以来，到现在已经有七年零三个多月了。中国人民是热爱和平的。只是在美国政府发动了侵朝战争，同时又侵占了我国的领土台湾，而且无视中国人民和中国政府的一再警告，悍然越过三八线，严重威胁我国安全的时候，中国人民才忍无可忍，发动了伟大的抗美援朝、保家卫国的运动，组成中国人民志愿军，开来朝鲜，配合朝鲜人民军抵抗美帝国主义的侵略。我们同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一道，在极端困难的条件下迎击了空前残暴的敌人，经过近三年的英勇斗争，终于击退了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军队的进犯，把敌人打回到他们原来发动战争的地方——三八线，迫使他们不得不把战争停止下来。停战以后，中国人民志愿军又同朝鲜人民军一起，严格地遵守停战协定的一切规定，反对美国方面不断破坏停战协定的阴谋和行为，为维护停战和保卫和平进行了坚决的斗争。同时，我军全体官兵在驻防时期，还协助了朝鲜人民重建自己的和平生活。
    中国人民志愿军的正义行动，一开始就受到中朝两国人民的热烈拥护和全力支援，受到全世界一切爱好和平的人民的深切同情和广泛支持。这就使我们有可能完成抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣使命，而没有辜负全中国人民的委托。我们的斗争和努力，对于制止侵略、保卫和平作出了应有的贡献。这是中国人民的光荣，也是我军全体官兵的光荣。在伟大的抗美援朝战争中牺牲的烈士们将永远活在朝中人民和全世界人民的心中，而万古流芳，永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军在进入朝鲜的七年多时间里，同朝鲜人民同艰苦，共患难，一起生活，一起战斗，结成了亲如手足的兄弟友谊。同时在实践中也使我们更加深切地体会到中朝人民唇齿相依、休戚与共的骨肉关系，体会到抗美援朝就是保家卫国的真理。七年来，我军同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军之间用鲜血凝结起来的这种战斗友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的。朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和金日成首相对于我军的爱护、支援和关怀，我们也将永远感念不忘。我们对朝鲜人民在战后时期恢复人民经济和建设社会主义所取得的伟大成就感到极大的鼓舞。朝鲜人民的勤劳勇敢的品质和艰苦奋斗的作风，值得我们永远学习。
    我们不久就要离开朝鲜了。我们将要同亲爱的朝鲜父老兄弟诸姑姊妹们告别，长期的战斗友谊使我们感到依依不舍。就是对朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木，我们都有着深厚的感情。在我们即将开始撤出朝鲜国土的时候，我们愿意向朝鲜人民保证，虽然我们即将离开你们了，但是，我们的心将永远同你们在一起，我们仍然会同在朝鲜的时候一样，继续关怀我们两国人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的共同事业。如果美帝国主义和它的追随者胆敢破坏朝鲜停战协定的尊严，再一次发动侵朝战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再一次跨过鸭绿江来，同朝鲜人民军一起为粉碎敌人的侵犯而共同战斗。朝中两国人民既然能在几年前打退美帝国主义的疯狂进攻，那么，当今天中朝两国人民的力量更加强大，而国际形势已经是东风压倒西风的时候，我们就更有把握使重新发动战争的侵略者遭到比上次更加惨重的失败。
    胜利将永远属于为反抗侵略而斗争的朝中人民！
    中朝人民间亲如骨肉的友谊和团结万岁！
