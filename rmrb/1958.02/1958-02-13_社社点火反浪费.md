    Light Fires in Every Commune to Oppose Waste
    The Fujian Daily raised a new issue of opposing waste. On February 7th, page two reported that old habits of extravagance and waste left over from the old society are still prevalent in Longxi, Qingliu, and other counties. For example, weddings require lavish banquets. In Xianhua Commune, Xintang Township, Longxi County, a couple whose children are already thirteen or fourteen years old, and who are both over forty, are planning to wear floral crowns and kowtow again during the Spring Festival to make up for the excessively simple wedding before liberation. The custom of hosting banquets and inviting guests is even more prevalent in Qingliu County. From childbirth to children wearing shoes, growing hair, celebrating one month, two years, four years, and ten years old; and from marriage to growing a beard and celebrating birthdays, banquets are held and guests are invited. In the past two months, there have been fifty such events in Chengbei Township alone. The Fujian Daily also published an editorial titled "Light Fires in Every Commune to Oppose Waste," believing that the entire province's rural areas should greatly promote thrift and oppose waste in managing households.
