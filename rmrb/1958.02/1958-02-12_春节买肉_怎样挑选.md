    Buying Meat for Spring Festival: How to Choose
    The Spring Festival is fast approaching, and almost every family is preparing to buy some pork, beef, or mutton to celebrate the Spring Festival and enjoy a dumpling meal.
    The pork, beef, and mutton we eat daily are all inspected before slaughter and after slaughter by slaughterhouses before being put on the market. However, unclean transportation tools, inadequate covering during transport, or improper storage during sales can cause contamination and spoilage.
    How do we identify the quality of meat when we buy it?
    Pork: Fresh pork has a slightly dry membrane on the surface, the muscle is dense and elastic, the fibers are fine and soft, and it is interspersed with fat. The color of the meat varies, depending on the age of the pig, its nutritional status, and the part of the body, and may be pale, grayish-red, light red, or dark red. The surface should be clean and hygienic, with clean scraping, and no sores, suppuration, or signs of pox. Non-fresh pork has a very dry surface, appears black or moldy and green, is unclean and dirty, and the muscle color is dark, moist, and sticky. Fresh frozen pork has a normal and bright color, the meat is firm, and when pressed with a hand, the contact surface appears red, the fat section is white, and the surface is clean. Non-fresh frozen meat has a surface contaminated with a lot of soil, the meat is purplish-brown or has an odor.
    Beef: Fresh yellow beef is brown-red and shiny, the meat is firm, the muscles are interspersed with fat, and there is no residual blood, hair, or contamination with soil and feces. Water buffalo meat is darker in color, with a deep brown-red color, the fibers are finer and looser, and the fat is drier.
    Mutton: Fresh mutton is firm, dark red, has fine fibers, and is slightly interspersed with fat, but the opposite is true for fattened sheep. Goat meat is paler in color than mutton, with less subcutaneous fat and intermuscular fat, and has a stronger muttony smell.
    Non-fresh beef and mutton have a very moist and sticky surface, are moldy and gray or green, and have an odor. At the same time, the surface of the meat is also very unhygienic.

    春节买肉  怎样挑选
    春节很快就要到了，几乎家家都在准备买点猪肉、牛肉或者羊肉过春节，吃一顿饺子。
    我们日常食用的猪、牛、羊肉，都是经过屠宰加工厂进行宰前检疫和宰后检验再投入市场的。但往往由于运搬工具不洁，途中苫盖不严或在销售环节中保管不善，也会造成污染和腐败变质。
    我们买肉时如何识别它的质量好坏呢？
    猪肉：鲜猪肉的表面有将干燥之外膜，肌肉细密而有弹性，纤维细软，并且夹杂脂肪。肉色因猪只的年龄大小及其营养状况与部位不同，而有苍白、灰红、苍红和暗红等不同。且表体清洁卫生，刮毛干净，无生疮化脓和有痘现象。非新鲜的猪肉是肉的表面很干燥，呈现黑色或起霉变绿、污秽不洁，肌肉色暗湿润而带粘性。新鲜的冻猪肉是色调正常而鲜明，肉质坚实，以手按之其接触面呈现红色，脂肪断面为白色，而且表体干净。非新鲜的冻肉的表面污染泥土较多，肉呈紫褐色或带有臭味。
    牛肉：凡颜色棕红发光，肉质坚实，肌肉间夹杂脂肪，无余血带毛和泥土粪便污染现象的黄牛肉，都是新鲜的。而水牛肉则肉色较暗，带有深棕红色，纤维较细而松弛，脂肪较干燥。
    羊肉：新鲜的绵羊肉的肉质坚实，颜色暗红，纤维较细，稍有脂肪夹杂，但肥育之绵羊则反之。山羊肉的颜色较绵羊的肉色苍白，皮下脂肪和肌肉间脂肪少，且膻味较大。
    非新鲜的牛肉和羊肉的表面非常湿润而带粘性，并且起霉发灰发绿，带有臭味，同时，肉的表面也很不卫生。
