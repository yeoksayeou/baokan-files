    In the newly built bathhouse in Masi Zhuang Township, Dengfeng County, at the foot of Mount Funiu in Henan Province, more than 50 children from the Yingnan No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative's kindergarten took a bath one afternoon. The children, stripped naked, exposing their round arms and legs, were both surprised and delighted. When they came in, they looked like little mud balls, but after the bath, they became clean and rosy.
    The Masi Zhuang bathhouse was jointly funded by six agricultural cooperatives in the township, and it was completed on January 15th. Masi Zhuang Township faces the Ying River and backs onto the Funiu Mountains. Since ancient times, the masses here have not had the habit of bathing regularly, especially in winter. Many old women and men have not bathed for decades. In January of this year, Masi Zhuang Township launched a sanitation campaign, proposing to change customs and habits and turn Masi Zhuang Township into a sanitary township. The six agricultural cooperatives then jointly established a bathhouse. The entire cost of building the bathhouse was only over 200 yuan, and many of the utensils were made using the cooperative's existing materials. For example, the bathhouse's two pools, thirteen small earthen beds for resting, and the straw mats on the earthen beds were all made from the cooperative's bricks, tiles, and wheat straw, and were built and woven by people drawn from the cooperative. The bathhouse also has a barbershop, and the barber is a cooperative member who has just learned to cut hair. A bath and a haircut together cost only about ten cents. Having a bathhouse not only cultivates people's hygiene habits, but also the sewage from the bath can be used as fertilizer.
    Since the establishment of the Masi Zhuang bathhouse, it has been warmly welcomed by the masses. In a month, more than 1,000 cooperative members have taken baths there. More than a dozen old women in their fifties and sixties in Masi Zhuang Village have gone to the bathhouse to bathe. An 85-year-old man, Wu Yonglin, who had never bathed in a bathhouse before, came to bathe with a cane on the first day the bathhouse opened. After the bath, he told everyone he met: Chairman Mao is so thoughtful for the people, calling on everyone to pay attention to hygiene is really great (meaning very good).
    Now, the people in this township are gradually changing their living habits. Every night, groups of cooperative members come to the bathhouse to wash off the dirt after returning from working in the reservoirs and fields.
    Like this kind of rural bathhouse, the Jindian District, where Masi Zhuang Township is located, has already established five. Around the Spring Festival, fifteen more will be added. The district plans to have bathhouses in every township and cooperative this year.

    乡村澡堂
    新华社记者　方徨
    在伏牛山脚下，河南登封县马寺庄乡新建的澡堂里，一天下午接待了五十多个颍南一社幼儿园的小朋友来洗澡。一个个脱得精光、露着圆滚滚的小胳膊和小腿的孩子们，又惊又喜。进来时一个个像土蛋蛋的娃娃，洗过澡后，变得又干净又红润了。
    马寺庄澡堂是由这个乡的六个农业社投资合办的，在1月15日建成。马寺庄乡面临着颍河，背靠着伏牛山脉，自古以来，这儿的群众就没有经常洗澡的习惯，尤其是冬天更不洗澡，有许多老大娘、老大爷几十年没有洗过澡。今年1月份，马寺庄乡开展卫生运动，提出要移风易俗，把马寺庄乡变成卫生乡的口号，六个农业社于是合资建立了一个澡堂。建立澡堂的全部用费只花了二百多元，很多用具都是利用合作社原有的物资制的。如澡堂里两个浴池、十三个供休息用的小土炕以及土炕上铺的草垫子，都是用社里的砖瓦和麦草，由社里抽人砌好、编好的。澡堂还设有一个理发室，理发员是由刚学会理发的社员担任。一个人连洗澡带理发只花一角钱左右。有了澡堂不仅养成了人们的卫生习惯，而且洗过澡的污水还可以作肥料。
    马寺庄澡堂建立以来，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。一个月来，已经有一千多个社员来洗过澡，马寺庄庄上有十多个五、六十岁的老太婆都到澡堂洗过澡。一个八十五岁、从来没有在澡堂里洗过澡的老大爷吴永林，在澡堂开办后的第一天就拄着拐杖来洗澡。洗后他逢人就说：毛主席替老百姓想得真周到，号召大家讲卫生就是不赖（很好的意思）。
    现在，这个乡的人们逐渐改变了生活习惯，每天晚上，成群的社员从水库和地里劳动回来以后，都要到澡堂里去洗掉一身的尘土。
    像这样的乡村澡堂，马寺庄乡所在的金店区已经建立了五个，春节前后还要增加十五个，这个区计划今年要做到乡乡、社社都有澡堂。
