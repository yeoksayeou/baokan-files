Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 11th: Over 90% of the workers at the Guangzhou General Station of the Guangdong Provincial Transportation Bureau have voluntarily expressed their determination to stay at their transportation posts during the Spring Festival and not take leave to return home.

This determination was first collectively proposed by the First Passenger Vehicle Team. Xu Bingyi, an old model worker of the team, said to the drivers: "After streamlining the organization and transferring cadres downwards, the administrative staff are doing the work of three people. During this busy Spring Festival transportation period, we drivers must also exert revolutionary vigor and never take leave to go home, and never leave our posts." The drivers said, "To support production and facilitate passengers, we can celebrate the festival anywhere." The eighteen drivers of the entire team quickly posted big-character posters expressing their determination.

After the first shot was fired, all the workshops and offices were buzzing. Those who signed up to respond to the challenge accounted for more than 90% of the station's employees. The administrative staff were not originally busy during the Spring Festival, but they also signed up to go to the grassroots stations to carry luggage for passengers, arrange seats, and clean the carriages.

    坚守运输岗位春节不回家
    广州运输总站90％的职工表示决心
    据新华社广州11日电　广东省运输局广州总站已有90％多的职工主动表示春节期间要坚守运输岗位，不请假回家。
    这个决心是第一客车分队首先集体提出的。这个分队的老模范许炳怡向队内的司机说：“紧缩机构、下放干部以后，行政管理人员一人作三人的工作了，我们司机在这运输繁忙的春节期间，也要发挥革命干劲，决不请假回家，决不离开工作岗位。”司机们表示：“为了支援生产，为了方便旅客，我们在哪里过节都行。”全分队十八个司机很快贴出了大字报，表示决心。
    第一炮打响以后，各车间、各股室都沸腾起来了。签名应战的人占全站职工90％多。行政管理人员春节工作本来不忙，但他们也纷纷报名要求到各基层车站去给旅客搬行李、对座位和打扫车厢。
