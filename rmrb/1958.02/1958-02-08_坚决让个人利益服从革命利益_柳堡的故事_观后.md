　　Resolutely Subordinate Individual Interests to Revolutionary Interests
　　——After Watching "The Story of Liubao"
　　Yang Guo
    What should be done when individual interests and revolutionary interests conflict? Is it to abandon revolutionary interests to fulfill individual interests, or to sacrifice individual interests to obey revolutionary interests? The film "The Story of Liubao" gives us a correct and reasonable answer.
    The story takes place and unfolds in Liubao, a newly liberated area during the Anti-Japanese War. While depicting Li Jin, the deputy squad leader of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army, the author also depicts the life and activities of our revolutionary troops at that time: how they trained soldiers, how they helped the local people with production, how they attacked enemy strongholds, etc., thereby expressing the flesh-and-blood connection between the revolutionary army and the people, and expressing the noble qualities of the revolutionary army.
    The film focuses on the love between Li Jin and Er Mei Zi, a rural girl, and Li Jin's self-struggle. When we see the simple, implicit, yet easily discernible admiration that Er Mei Zi expresses for Li Jin, we may feel a little surprised. But, when we learn about the tragic life experience of this rural girl, we will understand her. At that time, there were only two paths in front of her: either to be possessed by the traitor Liu Hu Zi and suffer for the rest of her life; or to choose a beloved soldier in the revolutionary troops she admired as her loyal and reliable protector, as her lifelong support. Naturally, Er Mei Zi, who was ambitious, would inevitably choose the latter. The closer disaster looms over a person, the stronger their yearning for happiness becomes; when a person is rescued from disaster, their gratitude to those who rescued them will be infinite. Er Mei Zi possesses both of these emotions. She focuses both of these emotions on Li Jin (although she also knows that rescuing her is not just Li Jin's affair alone), which naturally grows and matures into a profound love. She regards this love as closely linked to her own destiny. It is serious, not frivolous.
    Li Jin's love for Er Mei Zi is also naturally formed. Li Jin initially has some good feelings for Er Mei Zi. This good feeling is built on: because she is also a sister from a family of sufferers, because of her love and care for him, and of course because of her beautiful youth and purity. However, when he understands her difficult situation, in addition to sympathy, he also develops a sense of inescapable responsibility, feeling that he has a responsibility to protect her from disaster, although at the time he does not understand that relying on his own strength alone to solve the disaster of Er Mei Zi alone cannot solve the entire revolutionary problem. And this love of Li Jin for Er Mei Zi is not allowed by the military discipline at that time, which constitutes a contradiction.
    This contradiction is resolved under the care and education of the Party. In the film, the image of the company political instructor is very amiable. He cares for Li Jin like an elder brother and also teaches him like an elder. When he talks to Li Jin, he affirms the correct aspects of Li Jin's thoughts and feelings, and also criticizes the incorrect aspects, so that Li Jin finally realizes that only by temporarily sacrificing personal immediate interests and obeying the needs of the revolution is it possible to safeguard not only the long-term interests of him and Er Mei Zi, but also the long-term interests of the entire nation. Finally, Li Jin restrained his emotions, obeyed the organization's decision, and after rescuing Er Mei Zi from Liu Hu Zi's hands, participated in the revolutionary struggle to liberate the whole country.
    The film ends with this arrangement: after the victory of the revolutionary war, with the permission and encouragement of the organization, Li Jin met with Er Mei Zi, who had also joined the revolution at this time. Therefore, their meeting was not simply a meeting between a couple of lovers, but a meeting between a couple of revolutionary comrades who had been separated for a long time. While tasting the fruits of the victory of the revolution, they also tasted the fruits of love. The comedic ending emotionally satisfies the audience; and the thematic idea that "individual interests and revolutionary interests are consistent" is also specifically expressed through artistic images.
    This film was produced by the August First Film Studio. The August First Film Studio has a short history, and the actors are all newcomers in the film industry. It is gratifying that they can achieve such results. We expect them to produce more and better new films.

　　坚决让个人利益服从革命利益
　　——“柳堡的故事”观后
　　杨果
    当个人利益和革命利益发生矛盾的时候应该怎么办？是背弃革命利益以成全个人利益呢，还是牺牲个人利益以服从革命利益？电影“柳堡的故事”给予我们一个正确而且合情合理的解答。
    故事是在抗日战争时期一个新解放区——柳堡中发生和展开的。作者在描写主要人物解放军某连副班长李进的同时，也描写了我们革命部队当时的生活和活动的情况：他们如何练兵，如何帮助当地群众生产，如何攻取敌人据点等等，从而表达了革命军队和人民的血肉联系，表达了革命军队的高贵品质。
    影片着重地表现了李进和农村姑娘二妹子的恋爱，以及李进进行的自我斗争。当我们看到二妹子对李进所表示的那种纯朴的含蓄的然而又一眼可以看得出的爱慕时，或许会感到有点突然。但是，当我们知道这个农村少女的可悲的身世以后，便会谅解她了。当时，在她的面前只有两条道路可走：或是被汉奸刘胡子所占有，痛苦一辈子；或是在她所喜欢的革命部队中，选择她心爱的一位战士，作为她忠实可靠的保护人，作为她终身的依靠。自然有志气的二妹子是必然会选择了后者的。当灾难越是逼近一个人的时候，他对幸福的憧憬就越强烈；当一个人在灾难中被人挽救出来时，他对挽救他的人们的感激会是无穷无尽。这两种感情，在二妹子身上都有。她把这两种情感集中地投注在李进身上（虽然她也知道挽救她不是李进一个人的事），就自然成长和成熟为一种深刻的爱情。她把这种爱情和自己的命运紧密连结起来看待。它是严肃的，而不是轻率的。
    李进对二妹子的爱情，也是自然形成的。李进最初对二妹子也有些好感。这种好感是建筑在：因为她也是受苦人家的姊妹，因为她对他的爱慕和关怀，当然也因为她美好的青春和纯洁。但是，当他了解到她的苦难处境时，在同情之外，他更产生了一种义不容辞的责任感，觉得他有保护她免于灾难的责任，虽然当时他还不理解，只凭自己一个人的力量，只解救二妹子一个人的灾难，是不能解决整个革命问题的。而李进对二妹子这种爱情，又为当时军纪所不允许，这就构成了矛盾。
    这个矛盾在党的关怀、党的教育下获得解决。影片中，连队指导员的形象，是非常可亲的。他像兄长一样爱护李进，也像长辈一样的教导他。他和李进谈话时，肯定了李进思想感情中正确的一面，也批判了不正确的一面，使李进终于认识到，只有暂时牺牲个人眼前利益，服从革命的需要，才有可能维护不但是他和二妹子的，而且是全民族的长远利益。终于李进克制了自己情感，服从了组织决定，在把二妹子从刘胡子的手中抢救出来以后，参加了解放全国的革命斗争。
    电影最后作了这样处理：革命战争胜利后，李进在组织的允许和鼓励下，和二妹子会见了，这时二妹子也已经参加革命了，因此他们的会见，已不单单是一对情人的会见，而是一对久别的革命同志的会见了。他们在尝到革命胜利果实的同时，也尝到了爱情的果实。喜剧的结局，从情感上满足了观众；而“个人利益和革命利益是一致的”。这个主题思想在理论上的含意，也通过艺术形象具体表达了出来。
    这部影片是由八一电影制片厂摄制的。八一制片厂历史不久，演员也都是影坛上一些新人，能有这样的成绩，确是可喜的。我们期待他们能生产出更多更好的新影片来。
