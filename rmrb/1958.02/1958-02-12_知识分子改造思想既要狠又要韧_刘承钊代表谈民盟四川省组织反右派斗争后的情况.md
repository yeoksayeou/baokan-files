Intellectuals must be both ruthless and resilient in reforming their thinking
    Representative Liu Chengzhao discusses the situation of the Sichuan Provincial Organization of the China Democratic League after the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    I fully endorse all the reports of the congress and am willing to resolutely fight for their implementation. Now, I will only make a statement on the situation of the Sichuan organization of the China Democratic League after the Anti-Rightist Struggle.
    Sichuan is one of the three major strongholds of the Zhang-Luo Anti-Party Alliance. In recent years, the Zhang-Luo Alliance, through their agents Pan Dakui and his right-wing group, carried out various anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies in Sichuan. Especially in May and June last year, they took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to direct right-wing elements in various parts of Sichuan to ignite a "big fire" of frantic attacks on the Party and socialism. This fire started in Chengdu and Chongqing and spread to more than ten cities and counties, including Ya'an, Nanchong, Leshan, Neijiang, Luzhou, Zigong, Mianyang, Suining, Xichang, Yibin, Santai, Xichong, Yuechi, and Jintang. At one point, some cities and counties could not continue their CPPCC meetings, and social order was disrupted in some cities and counties. Their reactionary arrogance reached its peak for a time. The fire they ignited spread to all sectors of society, with the cultural and educational circles, especially universities and colleges, as the focus of their attack. Ten out of the eleven universities and colleges in Chengdu were ignited by them. At Southwest Normal College in Chongqing and Nanchong Normal College, they incited and manipulated students to plan strikes and demonstrations. At Sichuan Agricultural College in Ya'an, they even manufactured a small disturbance according to their criminal intentions. In May last year, the Pan Dakui right-wing group specially sent its confidant Zhao Yiming to Ya'an to mobilize right-wing elements at the Agricultural College to "be gunners and lift the lid." Under their instigation, right-wing elements at the Agricultural College, using the excuse of opposing the relocation of the college, openly put forward reactionary slogans such as "opposing the highest leading organ, the State Council" and "bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism." They also established a so-called "Action Committee," forcing students to strike and boycott exams, and demonstrate in the streets, causing trouble at the Ya'an Railway Station, demanding to petition in Chengdu. Not only that, they even detained and interrogated the responsible comrades of the work team sent by the Ya'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Agricultural College to help with the rectification, monitored the secretary of the college Party committee, and beat the secretary of the Ya'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the president of the Ya'an Municipal People's Court who went to maintain order. What is even more appalling is that they also attempted to steal rifles, cut electric wires, and planned to set fires and kill people. In Ya'an, they had caused such upheaval. One can imagine how many heads would have fallen if their entire conspiracy had succeeded!

    The vigorous Anti-Rightist Struggle achieved victory. The rightists were isolated, the centrists turned to the left, and the leftists became stronger.
    However, things did not and could never develop as the Zhang-Luo Alliance had hoped. Things moved forward according to the wishes of the working people and along the bright road of socialism. The Zhang-Luo Alliance's criminal activities against the Party and socialism in Sichuan profoundly educated the people from the negative side and aroused the incomparable indignation of the broad masses of people and the majority of honest members of the Democratic League. In the past six months, under the leadership of the Party, the Sichuan Democratic League launched a vigorous Anti-Rightist Struggle, exposing 427 right-wing group members and other right-wing elements, accounting for 16.96% of the total number of Democratic League members in Sichuan. At present, the Anti-Rightist Struggle has basically ended with a major victory. The great victory of the Anti-Rightist Struggle is not only manifested in the thorough exposure and isolation of the rightists, but more importantly, it has educated the broad masses of centrists, enabling them to take a big step forward on the road of socialist transformation and undergo varying degrees of leftward political changes. According to statistics from the Chengdu Institute of Technology branch of the Democratic League, out of the 51 members in the institute, excluding 4 right-wing elements, in the early stage of the Anti-Rightist Struggle, there were 12 leftists and 35 centrists (including 11 centrists leaning to the left and 12 centrists leaning to the right). After the education and training of the Anti-Rightist Struggle, the number of leftists has increased to 16, while the number of center-right elements has decreased to 6 (a decrease of 50% compared to the original figure). At present, whether from the perspective of the Democratic League organization or the individual situation of the Democratic League members, some gratifying new atmospheres have initially emerged on a number of major issues.

    Whether or not to have the leadership of the Party and whether or not to take the socialist road is the fundamental difference between us and the bourgeois rightists. In general, bourgeois intellectuals fundamentally do not oppose the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road. They have a positive side in that they can accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road. On the other hand, because they basically still stand on the bourgeois position, they always have varying degrees of suspicion and resistance to the leadership of the Party, especially the Party's leadership on the cultural, educational, scientific, and technological fronts, believing that in the past, "the Party managed too much, controlled too tightly, and hindered initiative." Some people even believe that "laymen cannot lead experts." Regarding the great achievements our country has made in recent years, generally speaking, they feel satisfied and excited, but they are not yet accustomed to or adapted to the socialist system, feeling out of place in many respects and having varying degrees of dissatisfaction and resistance. A member of the Democratic League who is a professor at Chengdu Institute of Technology said: "In the past, although I did not openly oppose the leadership of the Party, I was never clear in my mind about why I should accept the leadership of the Party. Because I felt uncomfortable with many of the Party's policies and guidelines, I could not help but have some doubts. For example, because it was inconvenient to buy things at one time, I doubted whether public-private joint ownership was superior." He also said that in the past, when he implemented the policies and tasks put forward by the Party Committee and the administration, he "often had to discount them." In the Anti-Rightist Struggle, the exposure of the bourgeois rightists' conspiracy to oppose the leadership of the Party and attempt to restore capitalism was an extremely vivid and profound education for the broad masses of centrists. Through this struggle, the broad masses of centrists clearly saw the road ahead of them: either accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road, or accept the leadership of the bourgeois rightists and take the capitalist road. There is no other road. And in today's China, the possibility of taking the latter road does not exist. They have the painful experience of living under reactionary rule in the past, and they are unwilling to take this road. Therefore, they have further moved closer to the Party, and their socialist consciousness has been generally improved compared to the past. In the past, the right-wing elements in the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Democratic League completely bypassed the left-wing elements in the League and failed to consult with the Communist Party, and held a series of symposiums with the nature of inciting trouble during the blooming and contending of helping the Party rectify its style, which made some centrists with unclear political attitudes be blinded and shouted with the right-wing elements, creating a very bad influence. However, after the Anti-Rightist Struggle won a victory, the right-wing elements were isolated, the centrists began to wake up, and supported the leadership of the left-wing elements in the Democratic League. This gradually transformed and strengthened the relationship between the League and the Party. Many tasks can be carried out by the League and the Party through consultation. After publicity and consultation, the Party's major policies concerning the Democratic League can be basically implemented within the Democratic League. For example, the leader of the Sichuan University Branch of the Democratic League had a large distance from the Party in the past and "nominally agreed but actually disagreed" with the Sichuan University Party Committee, and completely adopted an attitude of opposition to the Party Committee during the blooming and contending. However, after the Anti-Rightist Struggle, they have been able to actively consult with the Party to carry out their work, and can rely on the Party members and left-wing elements of the League to carry out their work. Also, for example, some professors at Chengdu Institute of Technology, when implementing the policies and tasks put forward by the school Party Committee in the past, were always discounted and could not be thoroughly implemented. But since the counter-party and counter-socialist conspiracy of the rightists was exposed, their attitude has also changed.

    Many League members have overcome some of their individualism. They are applying to go to the countryside and mountains and are willing to transform themselves through labor.
    Another new atmosphere that has appeared among the majority of League members is reflected in their attitude towards work and various issues. In the past, many League members verbally spoke of serving the people wholeheartedly, but in reality, they stood on the bourgeois individualistic position. For whatever issue, they always started from the selfish and self-interested point of view, pursuing personal fame and status everywhere. Whenever their personal desires could not be fulfilled, they were full of complaints and dissatisfaction. Some people "looked at the other mountain and thought it was higher," and had opinions wherever they went, and were not at ease with their work. In teaching, they "taught but did not teach people," "managed teaching but did not manage learning," saying that "it does not matter whether it is a yellow cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat." They did not educate students according to socialist requirements, but stubbornly reflected and promoted bourgeois academic viewpoints, instilling bourgeois worldviews and outlooks on life in students. In scientific research work, they also often divorced themselves from reality and the collective, first considering how to make themselves famous and profitable, without regard to the needs of socialist construction and the demands of the broad masses of working people. They shut themselves up in their personal studies or laboratories, unwilling to cooperate with others, unwilling to conduct collective research, fearing that others would benefit from their light or take advantage of them, and the result was often futile, even harming others and benefiting themselves. All these problems have been criticized many times in the past, and some effects have been achieved. But because the fundamental position of intellectuals has not fundamentally changed, these problems cannot be completely solved for a while. After the education of the Anti-Rightist Struggle, especially after the exposure and criticism during the key rectification stage, many League members' socialist consciousness has been raised to varying degrees, and they have made preliminary criticisms of their bourgeois individualistic thinking. League member teachers who had been uneasy in their work for a long time are now settled; those who did not care about politics and did not actively participate in political movements in the past have now changed; many people have initially criticized their bourgeois teaching viewpoints; some have abandoned their long-standing scientific research plans that were divorced from reality; and many problems that could not be solved in their work for a long time have now been solved. Those who used to complain about "not enough space" and "too few instruments" no longer complain; those who used to have two people doing the work of one person and still shouting "not enough manpower" now have cadres sent down, manpower reduced, but work is still proceeding as usual, and even better than before.

    On the issue of ideological remolding, most League members generally lacked due awareness in the past and had varying degrees of resistance. They were dissatisfied with the ideological remolding movements of the past, considering it "a painful lesson," and today they believe that intellectuals have already been remolded and are no longer two-faced, and that the current problem is only a general issue of ideological style. They said, "Whoever says that intellectuals need to be remolded must remold themselves." During the Great Blooming and Contending period, under the instigation and deception of right-wing elements, the broad masses of centrists showed varying degrees of wavering, proving that they did not only have general ideological style problems, but that the fundamental problem of their political stance had not been resolved. After the education of the Anti-Rightist Struggle, most League members had a clearer assessment of themselves than before and felt the need for fundamental remolding to varying degrees. Many people actively applied to go to the countryside and mountains, willing to remold themselves in labor training. Out of the 48 League members at Sichuan University of Finance and Economics (excluding 14 right-wing members), 46 applied; the number of League members at Sichuan Medical College who applied to go to the countryside and mountains also accounted for more than 80% of the total number of League members. In the past, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism was very thin within the Democratic League. Many people believed that criticism was "suppression" and "encirclement and suppression," so they were all friendly and superficially harmonious, and their thoughts did not meet. After the Anti-Rightist Struggle, due to the increased awareness of ideological remolding, this situation has changed significantly. A League member teacher at Sichuan University of Finance and Economics had consistently been unwilling to accept opinions, and when others criticized him, he often walked away or left the meeting halfway, expressing resistance. Now, he has been able to accept opinions more humbly. When the form of big-character posters first appeared, many League members were not used to it, thinking that "there are many ways to criticize" and that it was not necessary to use the form of big-character posters. They said that big-character posters were "public warnings" and were not suitable for the so-called characteristics of intellectuals. But now, many people are happy to use the form of big-character posters. In the general rectification movement of cadres in the Sichuan Provincial and Municipal Committees of the Democratic League, after ten days of blooming and contending, 24 cadres posted more than 300 big-character posters, most of which were directed at leading cadres (including political stance and leadership style), and most of the criticized leading cadres also expressed their willingness to accept them humbly.

    These new changes in the Sichuan Democratic League after the Anti-Rightist Struggle are gratifying. It convincingly illustrates the great significance of the Anti-Rightist Struggle and also illustrates the truth that the Democratic Parties organizations and the individuals of the Democratic Parties members must undergo fundamental reform and can be reformed under the leadership of the Party.

    It is only the beginning of fundamentally transforming the political position. It still requires a long and arduous struggle.
    However, it should be seen that the above new atmosphere only reflects the beginning of intellectuals' fundamental transformation of their political position. On the one hand, these new atmospheres should be acknowledged, but these new atmospheres must not be overestimated. The new atmosphere is only a beginning. Transforming bourgeois intellectuals into working-class intellectuals is by no means an overnight success. It must go through a long, repeated, and arduous struggle. Therefore, our Democratic League organization must continue to help its members and the intellectuals it is connected with, under the leadership of the Party, through the rectification movement, through regular education work and labor practice, to gradually realize the serious task of fundamentally transforming themselves.
    (1) It should be seen that after the Anti-Rightist Struggle, although the broad masses of League members have made varying degrees of improvement and progress, on the issue of accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road, there are still many people who are in an unconscious, passive, and intermediate state. In the future, they may still resist the leadership of the Party and waver in taking the socialist road on various issues. Therefore, we must continue to help the broad masses of League members further "break the capitalist position and establish the socialist position," gradually overcome and finally eliminate their wavering state in accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road, so that they can stand firmly on the position of the working class and serve the cause of socialist construction wholeheartedly.
    (2) Most League members have deeply ingrained bourgeois individualistic ideas. Although this idea has been criticized more deeply in the Anti-Rightist Struggle and the rectification study, some people still do not admit that there is a need for fundamental remolding; some people verbally admit that there is a need for self-remolding, but lack due determination and courage. We must help the broad masses of League members to deeply remold their ideology, gradually establish and strengthen the proletarian collectivist consciousness, and overcome bourgeois individualistic ideas.
    (3) In the high tide of sending cadres down to lower levels, many League members applied to go to the mountains and the countryside, demanding to be tempered and transformed in the mass struggle and labor production. This is a gratifying new phenomenon. However, some League members still cannot let go of the stinking airs of intellectuals, and still despise industrial and agricultural production and the workers and peasants, thinking that the peasants are "backward" and that intellectuals going to the mountains and the countryside is "making a big fuss over a trifle" and "not worth the loss." They are still content with their state of "not touching the sky above and not touching the ground below," like gentlemen on the beams, unwilling to combine with the workers and peasants and combine with reality. We must further enlighten the consciousness of the broad masses of League members, help them put down their airs, and promote their combination with the workers and peasants and their combination with productive practice, so as to truly transform themselves and better serve the cause of socialist construction.
    Through the rectification and the Anti-Rightist Struggle, the Sichuan Democratic League organization and the broad masses of League members have undergone great changes. On this basis, we should further strive, under the leadership of the Party, to complete the fundamental transformation of the Democratic League organization and the individual members of the League.

    知识分子改造思想既要狠又要韧
    刘承钊代表谈民盟四川省组织反右派斗争后的情况
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告，并愿为其贯彻实现而坚决奋斗。现在仅就民盟四川组织经过反右派斗争后的情况作如下发言。
    四川是章罗反党联盟的三大据点之一。近年来，章罗联盟通过他们的代理人潘大逵及其右派集团在四川进行了种种反党反社会主义的阴谋活动。尤其是在去年五、六月间，他们利用党整风的机会，指挥四川各地右派分子放起了一场向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的“大火”。这场火从成都、重庆两地烧起，一直烧到雅安、南充、乐山、内江、泸州、自贡、绵阳、遂宁、西昌、宜宾、三台、西充、岳池、金堂等十余市县，一度闹得有的市县政协会议开不下去，有的市县社会秩序受到破坏，其反动气焰的嚣张，一时达于极点。他们所放的火遍及社会各界，而以文教界、特别是大专学校作为进攻的重点；成都十一所大专学校中已有十所被他们点起火来，重庆西南师范学院、南充师范专科学校，在他们的煽动操纵下，曾经酝酿罢课游行，而在雅安四川农学院，他们更是按照了他们的罪恶意图，制造了一次小的骚乱。去年五月，潘大逵右派集团特派心腹干将赵一明去雅安活动，鼓动农学院右派分子“当炮手，揭盖子”；农学院右派分子在他们唆使下，以反对迁院为借口，公然提出“反对最高领导机关国务院”，“官僚主义比资本主义更危险”等反动口号，并成立了所谓“行动委员会”，强迫学生罢课罢考，上街游行，大闹雅安车站，要到成都请愿。不仅如此，他们竟至扣押审讯中共雅安地委派到农学院帮助整风的工作组负责同志，监视学院党委书记，殴打前去维持秩序的中共雅安市委书记和雅安市人民法院院长，而更令人发指的是，他们还企图窃夺步枪，割取电线，打算放火和杀人。在雅安这个地方，他们曾经闹得这样天翻地覆，可以设想，他们的整个阴谋如果得逞，全中国不知将有多少人头落地！
    声势浩大的反右派斗争取得胜利  右派孤立中间派向左转左派强大
    但是，事情并没有而且也决不可能如像章罗联盟所妄想的那样发展，事情是按照劳动人民的意愿，按照社会主义的光明道路前进的。章罗联盟在四川的反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，从反面深刻地教育了人民，激起了广大人民和多数正直盟员的无比义愤。半年来，在党的领导下，四川民盟开展了声势浩大的反右派斗争，先后揭发出了潘大逵等右派集团分子和其他右派分子四百二十七名，占四川盟员总数的百分之十六点九六。目前，反右派斗争已经以取得重大胜利而基本结束。反右派斗争的伟大胜利，不仅表现在彻底暴露和孤立了右派，更重要的是教育了广大的中间分子，使他们在接受社会主义改造的道路上大大地前进了一步，在政治上发生了不同程度地向左前进的变化。据成都工学院民盟支部统计，该院五十一个盟员中，除右派分子四人不计外，在反右派斗争初期，左派十二人，中间派三十五人（内中间偏左的十一人，中间偏右的十二人）；经过反右派斗争的教育和锻炼，左派已增为十六人，而中右分子则减为六人（较原数字减少百分之五十）。目前，无论是就民盟组织或者是就民盟盟员的个人情况来看，在若干重大问题上，都已经初步地出现了一些可喜的新气象。
    要不要党的领导和走不走社会主义道路，这是我们和资产阶级右派之间的根本分歧所在。一般资产阶级知识分子根本上并不反对党的领导和走社会主义道路，他们具有可以接受党的领导和走社会主义道路的积极的一面，但另一面，由于他们基本上还站在资产阶级立场，他们对于党的领导，特别是对党在文教科技战线上的领导，总是存在着不同程度的怀疑和抵触，认为过去“党管得太多，卡得太紧，妨碍了积极性”，有的人甚至认为“外行不能领导内行”；对于我们国家几年来所取得的伟大成就，一般的说，他们感到满意和兴奋，但对于社会主义制度，他们却一时还不习惯，不适应，在很多方面感到格格不入，也存在着不同程度的不满和抵触。成都工学院有一位盟员教授说：“过去我虽然没有公开反对党的领导，但对为什么要接受党的领导，思想上一直不明确。对党的很多方针政策，由于自己感觉不方便，就不免有些怀疑。比如因为买东西一时不方便，我就怀疑公私合营是否优越”，他又说，他过去执行党委和行政所提出的方针任务时，“往往要打折扣”。在反右派斗争中，资产阶级右派分子反对党的领导和企图使资本主义复辟的阴谋被揭露之后，这对广大中间分子来说，是一次极其生动和深刻的教育。经过这次斗争的教育，广大中间分子清楚地看到了摆在他们面前的道路：或者是接受党的领导，走社会主义的道路；或者是接受资产阶级右派的领导，走资本主义的道路。其他的道路是没有的。而在今天中国的条件下，走后一条道路的可能性是不存在的，他们有着过去在反动统治时代生活的痛苦经验，也不愿意走这一条道路。因此，他们已进一步向党靠拢，社会主义觉悟较前普遍有所提高。民盟成都市委机关中的右派分子，在去年利用帮助党整风的鸣放中，曾完全撇开了盟内左派分子和不与共产党协商，单独召开了一系列的带有煽风点火性质的座谈会，因而使得一些政治态度不明的中间分子受了蒙蔽，跟着右派分子叫喊，造成了十分恶劣的坏影响。但以上情况自反右派斗争获得了胜利，右派分子被孤立，中间分子开始醒悟过来，并拥护民盟内左派分子的领导，这样就逐步转变和密切了盟与党的关系，许多工作民盟与党可以彼此协商进行了，经过宣传协商，党的有关民盟的重大方针政策，可以基本在民盟内贯彻执行了。如民盟四川大学支部领导人，过去和党有较大的距离，对川大党委“貌合神离”，在大鸣大放中更是完全采取和党委对立的态度。但在反右派斗争以后，已能主动的向党彼此协商进行工作，能依靠民盟内的党员与盟的左派分子进行工作了。又如成都工学院的某些教授，过去在贯彻执行学校党委会所提出的方针任务时，总是被打折扣而无法彻底贯彻的。但自右派分子的反党反社会主义阴谋被揭穿后，他们的态度也改变了。
    不少盟员的个人主义有所克服  申请下乡上山愿在劳动中改造
    出现在多数盟员中的另一个新气象，表现在他们对待工作和各种问题的态度上。过去不少盟员口头上讲全心全意为人民服务，但实际上站在资产阶级个人主义立场上。对无论什么问题，他们总是首先从个人自私自利观点出发，处处都在追求个人的名誉地位，每当个人欲望不能称心如意的时候，他们就牢骚满腹，抵触不满，有的人“这山看着那山高”，走到那里也有意见，不安心工作。在教学上，他们“教学不教人”“管教不管学”，说是“不管黄猫黑猫，只要捉到耗子就是好猫”。他们不是按照社会主义的要求对学生进行教育，而是固执地反映和宣扬资产阶级的学术观点，向学生贯输资产阶级的世界观和人生观。在科学研究工作上，他们也往往脱离实际，脱离集体，首先考虑的是如何使自己成名得利，而不计及社会主义建设的需要和广大劳动人民的要求，他们孤单单地把自己个人关在书房里或者实验室里，不同别人配合协作，不愿意集体研究，唯恐别人沾了他的光，沾了他的便宜，而结果往往是徒劳无功，甚至是损人不利己。所有这一切问题，过去曾经多次批判过，也或多或少收到了一些效果。但因为知识分子的根本立场基本上尚未改变，这些问题一时也不可能彻底解决。经过反右派斗争的教育，特别是经过着重整改阶段的揭发批判，不少盟员的社会主义觉悟有了不同程度的提高，他们对自己的资产阶级个人主义思想已作了初步的批判。过去长期不安心工作的盟员教师，现在情绪安定了；过去对政治不关心，对政治运动不积极参加的人，现在有了转变；很多人初步地批判了自己的资产阶级教学观点；有的人放弃了自己过去长期坚持的脱离实际的科学研究计划；很多业务工作上长期不能解决的问题，现在也解决了；过去闹“空间不够”“仪器太少”的人，现在不闹了；过去两个人做一个人的事还在喊“人手不够”，现在干部下放，人手减少，工作仍然照常进行，而且比过去做得还好。
    在思想改造问题上，多数民盟盟员过去普遍缺乏应有的自觉，存在着不同程度的抵触情绪，他们对过去的思想改造运动不满，认为那是“一个痛苦的教训”，而在今天他们认为知识分子已经改造好了，没有两面性了，目前的问题只是一般的思想作风问题。他们说：“谁说知识分子要改造，谁本身就得改造”。大鸣大放期间，在右派分子的煽惑和愚弄下，广大中间分子不同程度地表现动摇，证明他们并不是只有一般思想作风问题，而是根本政治立场问题没有得到解决。经过反右派斗争的教育，多数盟员对于自己有了较前清醒的估计，在不同程度上感到了根本改造自己的必要，很多人踊跃申请下乡上山，愿意在劳动锻炼中改造自己。四川财经学院共有盟员四十八人（右派十四人未计算在内），提出申请的即达四十六人；四川医学院的盟员申请下乡上山的，也占盟员总数百分之八十以上。在民盟内部，批评和自我批评的空气过去非常稀薄，很多人认为批评是“打击”，是“围剿”，因而彼此一团和气貌合神离，思想不见面。反右派斗争后，由于对思想改造的自觉性有所提高，这种情况已有显著的转变。四川财经学院有一位盟员教师，一贯不虚心接受意见，别人批评他时，往往拂袖而去或者中途退出会场，表示抗拒，现在别人提出意见，他已能比较虚心地接受。大字报这种形式开始出现时很多盟员不习惯，认为“批评方式多种多样”，不一定要采用大字报的形式，他们说大字报是“当众警告”，不适合所谓知识分子的特点，而现在，不少人乐于采用大字报这种形式了。民盟四川省市委机关干部在一般整风中，经过十天的鸣放，二十四个干部共贴出了大字报三百多份，其中大部分是针对领导干部的（包括政治立场和领导作风等），被批评的领导干部也大多数表示了虚心接受的态度。
    四川民盟在反右派斗争以后所出现的这样一些新变化是令人高兴的。它令人信服地说明了反右派斗争的伟大意义，也说明了民主党派组织和民主党派成员个人必须进行根本改造和在党的领导下可以得到改造的真理。
    仅仅是根本改造政治立场的开始  还需要经过长期艰苦的斗争过程
    但是，应该看到，以上一些新气象仅仅是反映了知识分子根本改造政治立场的开始。一方面应当承认这些新气象，但对于这些新气象决不能估计过高。新气象还仅仅是开始。把资产阶级知识分子改造成为工人阶级知识分子决不是一蹴可成的，它必须经过长期的、反复的、艰苦的斗争过程。因此，我们民盟组织还必须在党的领导下，通过整风运动，经过经常的教育工作和劳动实践，帮助自己的成员及其所联系的知识分子逐步实现根本改造自己的严重任务。
    （一）应该看到，经过反右派斗争，广大盟员虽然已经有了不同程度的提高和进步，但在接受党的领导和走社会主义道路的问题上，还有不少的人仍然处于不自觉的被动的中间状态，他们在今后还可能在这样那样的一些问题上对党的领导发生抵触，对走社会主义道路发生动摇。因此，我们还必须继续帮助广大盟员进一步“破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场”，逐步克服以至最后消灭他们在接受党的领导和走社会主义道路上的动摇状态，使他们能站稳工人阶级的立场，全心全意的为社会主义建设事业服务。
    （二）多数盟员存在着根深蒂固的资产阶级个人主义思想。在反右派斗争和整风学习中，这种思想虽然受到了比较深刻的批判，但是有些人仍然不承认有根本改造自己的必要；有些人虽然口头上承认有自我改造的必要，但是缺乏应有的决心和勇气。我们必须帮助广大盟员深入思想改造，逐步树立和坚定无产阶级集体主义意识，克服资产阶级个人主义思想。
    （三）在干部下放的高潮中，不少盟员申请上山下乡，要求在群众斗争和劳动生产中锻炼改造自己。这是一种可喜的新现象。但是有些盟员仍然放不下知识分子的臭架子，仍然轻视工农业生产和工农群众，认为农民“落后”，知识分子上山下乡是“大材小用”“得不偿失”等等。他们仍安于自己所处的那种“上不沾天，下不着地”梁上君子的状态，不愿同工农结合，同实际结合。我们必须进一步启发广大盟员的自觉，帮助他们放下架子，促进他们同工农群众结合，同生产实践结合，以便于真正改造自己，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    经过整风和反右派斗争，四川民盟组织和广大盟员已经起了很大的变化。在这个基础上，我们应当在党的领导下，进一步努力，为完成民盟组织和盟员个人的根本改造而奋斗。
