    Qi Baishi's "Getting Rich" picture has attracted the attention of many viewers. The abacus in "Getting Rich", as a visual image, is really not more attractive than Qi Baishi's flowers, birds, insects, and fish. However, that long inscription can be read as an independent literary work, and it feels meaningful to read. It touches on significant social issues, but it doesn't seem to be following any solemn intention, just casual conversation. It doesn't feel difficult to read, and it seems like the painter didn't find it difficult to write either.

    Reading such an inscription easily brings to mind excellent Chinese literary works, those literary works where "the words are exhausted, but the meaning remains."

    In a collection of jokes compiled in the Ming Dynasty, there is one titled "Feng Shui"; like the inscription on "Getting Rich", it is very interesting to read, and its satirical effect is also very strong. Its content is like this:

    A dying man asked his son to nail four large copper rings to the side of his coffin. The son asked him why. He replied: "In the future, you will inevitably listen to the feng shui masters and move me around."

    Such a joke does not explicitly say what ideological struggle it is fighting against, but its essence has not deviated from the major issues of ideology. This bizarre story not only mocks those who are superstitious about feng shui, greedy for wealth, and willing to exploit the dead, but also mocks those hypocrites who hide their unsightly purposes behind beautiful reasons.

    A clear theme does not mean dry and monotonous language, and a serious theme does not necessarily have to be embodied only in a solemn form. A light and lively form and sharp ideological content do not have to conflict. A conversation does not have to directly state a conclusion to be considered conclusive, and content with affirmative significance can be expressed in a questioning tone. In order to avoid stiff and thus boring preaching, and to enhance the appeal and persuasiveness of art, the above-mentioned jokes and Qi Baishi's inscription on "Getting Rich" should also be worthy models for how to reflect life. Even though these works are satirical rather than eulogistic.

    Qi Baishi painted a tumbler when he was in his sixties, which was also a satirical work of art. The appearance of the tumbler is very similar to the clown in a song and dance drama wearing official robes. He inscribed a poem on the painting, saying that those uneducated bureaucrats are like tumblers, without a heart. Along with the poem, he also inscribed a few lines. The general idea is: once, in front of the Nanyue Temple, he spent three coins to buy a tumbler and gave it to his son to play with. The eldest son thought it was a clever thing and advised him to take it with him when he traveled far, and to copy some for the children to play with. Little did the eldest son know that this thing is everywhere. These inscriptions, like the inscription on "Getting Rich", have one advantage: they are good at inspiring readers to "participate" in the "creative" activity of art, instead of simply stuffing certain concepts into readers, not forcing readers to accept certain concepts. In the double meaning of the words, it clearly contains the painter's hatred of the reactionary rulers. However, this expression of hatred does not try to force the audience to be moved like an over-the-top, emotion-manufacturing performance, but is a powerful enlightenment, an interesting inducement. Like those visual images that express the beauty of flowers, birds, insects, and fish, it makes the appreciator naturally accept the old painter's propaganda.

    The inscription on "Getting Rich", like the inscriptions in the jokes "Feng Shui" and "Tumbler", has meaning within the words. To make it easier for most readers to read, I tried to translate it into Mandarin:

    In May of the Dingmao year (1927), someone asked me to paint a "Getting Rich" picture. I asked: "There are too many ways to get rich, what should I paint?" The guest said: "Whatever you want." I asked: "Should I paint Zhao Yuanshuai (the God of Wealth)?" The answer was: "No." I asked again: "How about painting the clothes, hats, and seals used by officials?" The answer was still: "No." I asked again: "How about painting things like knives, guns, and ropes?" The guest said: "No, either. Paint an abacus." I said: "That's very good. It can both get rich and avoid dangerous means; the abacus is a thing of benevolence." So I painted it in one go and inscribed the words. After the guest left, I painted another one and kept it for myself. The God of Wealth, clothes, hats, seals, knives, guns, ropes, and the abacus are all independent phenomena; the ways to get rich, dangerous means, and benevolence are all independent concepts. When they are combined together, relying on their complementary roles, people feel that within this combination, there is a hidden, intangible but clearly perceptible concept, emotion, and even thought. All of this is not because the author cannot say it directly, not because the author does not dare to say it directly, not because it is inconvenient to say it directly, but because it is intentionally left for the reader to say. That is to say: the clothes, hats, and seals used by reactionary rulers, the knives, guns, and ropes used by robbers, and the abacus used by exploiters are not in themselves hateful things, they do not in themselves represent good or evil, just as the pens and inks used for writing and painting have no class nature. However, when they are combined with concepts such as ways to get rich and dangerous means, rather than with concepts such as diligence and labor, the reader will, as the painter expects, form a judgment in their mind that can only be this and not that, determining that the nature of illegitimate means of making money is equivalent to the plunder of robbers.

    If the strength of film art montage lies in embodying a specific theme through the use of excellent structure, then Qi Baishi's inscription on "Getting Rich", like Du Fu's "Ballad of the War Wagons" and Ma Zhiyuan's "Heavenly Pure Sand", can be appreciated as a film montage.

    Looking at it as a camera, the old painter's point of attention is shifting. By using this shift, he highlights the nature of individual things under specific conditions. Moreover, more importantly, based on the old painter's selection and organization of the "details" that make up the montage sentence, it expresses Qi Baishi's creative intention as a "playwright" or "director." His "camera" first faces Zhao Yuanshuai, who represents the desire to get rich, then the clothes, hats, and seals of officials, then the knives, guns, and ropes used by reactionary rulers or robbers, and then the abacus, the "dangerous means," and "benevolence." Without relying on explanatory "subtitles," this group of "shots" with clear clues has revealed the full meaning of things, and embodies the attitude of the old painter standing from the perspective of the working people—opposing the exploiters, hating exploitation. That is to say, these phenomena and concepts, combined according to the painter's certain creative intention (not arbitrarily pieced together), provide readers with a powerful hint, causing readers to associate with something that does not directly appear in the text. This is like the so-called "intermediate object" produced by several shots linked together. Qi Baishi does not present the reader with abstract conclusions, but leads the reader to a certain conclusion. As a fighting weapon, this way of writing that "exhausts the words but leaves the meaning inexhaustible" is a very interesting and powerful way of writing.

    The advantages of this inscription in terms of language skills are the same as the techniques used by the old painter when shaping visual images. It not only makes certain relatively close phenomena and concepts complement each other, just as people juxtapose peach blossoms and human faces, making it easy for readers to understand their commonalities. Moreover, just as he paints flowers, birds, insects, and fish, he is good at making things of opposing nature, allowing opposing things to achieve a unified and harmonious description, thereby strengthening the attractiveness and expressiveness of the artistic image. In painting, Qi Baishi is accustomed to making contrasting factors such as guest and host, strength and weakness, virtual and real, movement and stillness, dryness and prosperity, density and lightness, and skillful and clumsy, so that the characteristics of the object are expressed very clearly. The inscription on "Getting Rich" is also a comparison of the combination of things of opposite nature. In order to further attack the exploiters, Qi Baishi deliberately said that the illegitimate tools for getting rich are "benevolent tools." "Benevolence" is sarcasm here; this sarcasm makes the contrast between benevolence and unrighteousness strong, making the nature of illegitimate means of making money—plunder, especially the nature of those plunderous behaviors hidden under false and beautiful reasons—more accurate, clearer, and more vivid. This way of writing is similar to Lu Xun's use of birthday buns to describe graves in the novel "Medicine", and similar to the saying "You are a good person, you are picked out from among the good people," in order to create a more powerful negation in the assumed affirmation.

    Using various methods, such as using circuitous rather than direct writing, arousing the reader's thinking, rather than stiffly stuffing ready-made opinions into the reader; this is one of the reasons why these literary works are interesting rather than boring. The playwright Stanislavsky believes: "In art, one can only induce, not command." ("Conversations", page 194) The artistic technique of the inscription on "Getting Rich" is not only a model of satirical literature.

    齐白石“发财图”的题跋
    ——文艺欣赏随笔
    王朝闻
    齐白石的“发财图”，引起很多观众的注意。“发财图”里的算盘，作为一种视觉形象，实在不见得比齐白石画的花、鸟、虫、鱼更吸引人。可是那一大段题跋，可以当成独立的文学作品阅读，读起来觉得意味深长。它接触了意义重大的社会问题，可是它好像不是服从什么庄严的意图，只不过随便谈天。读起来觉得很不吃力，也觉得画家写起来很不吃力似的。
    读了这样的题跋，很容易联想到中国优美的文学作品，联想到那些“文已尽而意有余”的文学作品。
    明朝选辑的一本笑话集里，有一则题名“风水”的；像“发财图”的题跋，读起来觉得很有趣，讽刺的作用也很强。它的内容是这样的：
    一个临终的人，要他的儿子在棺材的边上钉四个大铜环。儿子问他，这是为什么？回答说：“你们日后少不得要听风水先生的话，把我搬来搬去”。
    这样的笑话，并不明说它是在和什么思想意识作斗争，它的实质却没有脱离思想意识的重大问题。这一个读起来觉得怪诞的故事，不只嘲笑了那些迷信风水、贪图富贵却又不惜利用死尸的人，而且，也嘲笑了那些把不漂亮的目的掩藏在漂亮的理由之下的伪善者。
    主题明确不是语言干瘪和单调，严肃的主题不一定只有一本正经的形式才能体现，轻松活泼的形式和思想尖锐的内容可以不冲突。不见得只有直接把结论说出来的谈话才算是有结论的，肯定意义的内容不见得不可以用疑问的语气来表现。为了避免生硬因而乏味的说教，为了加强艺术的吸引力和说服力，上述的笑话和齐白石“发财图”的题跋，应该也是如何反映生活的一种值得学习的榜样。尽管这些作品是讽刺的而不是歌颂的。
    齐白石在六十多岁时，画了一幅不倒翁，也是一件讽刺的艺术品。不倒翁的样子很像歌舞剧中的官衣丑。画上题了一首诗，说那些没有学问的官僚和不倒翁一样，没有心肝。和诗一起还题了几行字。大意是说：从前在南岳庙前，花了三个钱买了一个不倒翁，送给儿子玩耍。大儿子认为是巧东西，劝他出远门时带了去，复制一些给孩子们玩耍。大儿子哪里知道，这东西到处都有。这些题跋，也像“发财图”的题跋一样，它的好处之一，是善于启发读者“参加”到艺术的“创造”活动中来，不是简单地把一定的概念硬塞给读者，不是强令读者接受一定的概念。在双关的话里，分明包含着画家憎恶反动统治者的心情。可是这种憎恶感情的表现，不像做戏过火、制造感情的表演那样，企图强求观众感动，而是一种有力的启发，有趣的诱导。像那些表现了花鸟虫鱼的美的视觉形象一样，使欣赏者自然而然地接受老画家的宣传。
    “发财图”里的题跋，也像笑话“风水”和“不倒翁”里的题跋，是话里边有话的。为了便于多数读者阅读，我尝试着把它用普通话译出来：
    丁卯年（1927年）5月初，有人找我画一幅“发财图”。我问：“发财的门路太多，画什么才好？”客人说：“随你便”。我问：“要画赵元帅（财神老爷）吗？”回答说：“不是”。我又问：“画官儿用的衣、帽、印玺之类的东西怎么样？”还是这样回答：“不是”。我又问：“画刀、枪、绳索之类的东西怎么样？”客人说：“也不是。画一块算盘吧。”我说：“那很好。既可以发财，又不用危险的手段；算盘，是仁的东西。”于是一下子就画成了，题了字。客人走后，我又另画了这一幅收藏起来。财神老爷，衣、帽、印玺、刀、枪、绳索，算盘，都是各自独立的现象；发财的门路，危险的手段，仁，都是一些各自独立的概念。当它们被组合在一起，靠它们相辅相成的作用，使人感到在这一组合之中，潜伏着一种不可捉摸却又是分明可以体会得出的观念、感情以至思想。这一切，不是作者不会直接说，不是作者不敢直接说，不是不便用语言直说，而是有意留给读者去说。这就是说：反动统治者使用的衣、帽、印玺，强盗使用的刀、枪、绳索，剥削者所使用的算盘，本身并不是什么可憎的东西，本身不代表善与恶，正如写字作画的笔和墨没有阶级性一样。可是，当它们和发财的门路、危险的手段等概念相结合，而不是和勤俭、劳动等概念相结合时，读者就会按照画家所预期，在脑海中构成只能如此而不能如彼的判断，断定不正当的生财之道的性质相当于强盗的掠夺。
    如果说电影艺术蒙太奇的长处在于运用佳妙的结构体现特定的主题，那么，齐白石的“发财图”的题跋，好像杜甫的“兵车行”，马志远的“天净沙”，可以当成电影的蒙太奇来欣赏。
    当成摄影机来看，老画家的注意点在转换。利用这种转换，突出了处于特定条件之下的各别事物的性质。而且，更重要的是基于老画家对于构成蒙太奇句子的“细节”的选择和组织，表现了作为“剧作者”或“导演”的齐白石的创造意图。他的“摄影机”首先是对着代表发财愿望的赵元帅，再是对着当官儿的衣、帽、印玺，再其次再对着反动统治者或强盗用的刀、枪、绳索，往后对着算盘，对着“危险的手段”，“仁”。不必依靠注释性的“字幕”，线索分明的这一组“镜头”已经揭示了事物全部的含义，体现了站在劳动人民角度来观察现实的老画家的态度——反对剥削者，憎恨剥削。这就是说，按照画家一定的创造意图而组合在一起（不是任意拼凑在一起）的这些现象和概念，给读者提供一种有力的暗示，使读者联想到一种没有直接出现在文字之内的东西。这好比互相联接在一起的几个镜头所产生的所谓“中间物”。齐白石不给读者提出抽象的结论，而是把读者引向一定的结论。作为战斗的武器，这种“言有尽而意无穷”的写法，是很有趣也很有力的写法。
    这一题跋在语言技巧上的好处，和老画家塑造视觉形象时所运用的手法是相通的。它不只是使某些比较接近的现象和概念互相补充，像人们把桃花与人面并提那样，让读者便于了解它们的共通性。而且，正如他画花、鸟、虫、鱼一样，善于使性质对立的东西，让对立的东西得到统一的和谐的描写，从而加强艺术形象的吸引力和表现力。齐白石在绘画里，惯于使宾主、强弱、虚实、动静、枯荣、浓淡、工拙等对立的因素，使对象的特质表现得很鲜明。“发财图”的题跋，也是对照利用性质相反的东西的结合。为了进一步攻击剥削者，齐白石故意把不正当的发财工具说成是“仁具”。“仁”，在这儿是一句反话；这一反话，使仁与不仁有了强烈的对比，使不正当的生财之道的性质——掠夺，特别是那些掩盖在虚伪的漂亮理由之下的掠夺行为的性质，显得更确切，更鲜明，更生动。这种写法，和鲁迅在小说“药”里用祝寿的馒头来形容坟墓相似，和人们所说“你是好人，你是好人里头拣出来的”语言相似，为的是在假设的肯定中造成更有力的否定。
    利用各种方式，例如不用径直的而用宛曲的写法，唤起读者的思索，而不是生硬地把现成的意见硬塞给读者；这就是这些文艺作品使人感到有味而不是枯燥的原因之一。戏剧家史坦尼斯拉夫斯基认为：“在艺术中只能诱导，不能命令。”（“谈话录”第194页）“发财图”的题跋的艺术技巧，不只是讽刺文学的榜样。
