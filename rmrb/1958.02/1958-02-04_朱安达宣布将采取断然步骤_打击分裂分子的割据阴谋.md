Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 3rd: Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda reported to the parliament this morning on the separatist conspiracy to establish a "State of Sumatra," saying that the government had obtained a document drafted by the fugitive former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, Lubis, concerning the conspiracy to establish a new "state" or another "central government." He said, "The government will take decisive steps to deal with any attempt to issue a declaration establishing a so-called state or government."

Juanda said: "The government is indeed aware that on January 9, 1958, a meeting was held in Sungai Dareh, a small town on the border of West Sumatra and Jambi, attended by a group of prominent figures in military and political circles." He said that among those present were Lubis, Simbolon, Jambek, Hussein, political leaders Natsir and Sjafruddin, and Sumitro. They discussed some political issues, and no definite solution was reached. The details of the meeting are still unknown.

Juanda said that the military leaders of the First Military Region, Second Military Region, and Aceh Defense Region in Sumatra have expressed their disapproval of any separatist attempts. The government is certain that the number of separatists is small, and their attempts to peddle their ideas will not succeed.

Juanda also condemned other colonialist conspiracies against Indonesia, such as destroying the Indonesian economy by encouraging barter trade and smuggling, sowing discord in order to frustrate Indonesia's struggle for the liberation of West Irian, and thwarting efforts to eliminate the remnants of colonialist economics throughout Indonesia.

　　朱安达宣布将采取断然步骤
    打击分裂分子的割据阴谋
    据新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达今天早上就分裂分子企图成立“苏门答腊国”的阴谋向国会作报告说，由在逃的前陆军副参谋长卢比斯所起草的、有关阴谋建立一个新的“国家”或另行成立一个“中央政府”的文件，已经落入政府的手里。他说：“政府将采取断然的步骤来对付任何尝试发布成立所谓国家或政府的宣言的企图”。
    朱安达说：“政府确实地知道，在1958年1月9日，在西苏门答腊和占碑边境的小镇双溪达腊曾经举行过一个会议，参加的有一批军界和政界出名人士”。他说，与会者当中有卢比斯、西姆波朗、贾姆贝克、侯赛尼、政治领袖纳席尔和沙弗鲁丁及苏米特罗等人。他们讨论了一些政治问题，没有获得肯定的解决办法，会议的详细内容还不知道。
    朱安达说，在苏门答腊的第一军区、第二军区和亚齐防区的军事领袖们已经表示他们不支持任何分裂主义者的企图。政府肯定分裂分子在数量上是少的，他们贩卖他们的想法是不会成功的。
    朱安达还谴责殖民主义者对印度尼西亚进行的其他阴谋活动，例如，用鼓励换货贸易和走私来摧毁印度尼西亚经济，进行挑拨离间以便挫折印度尼西亚争取解放西伊里安的斗争和在全印度尼西亚肃清殖民主义经济残余的努力。
