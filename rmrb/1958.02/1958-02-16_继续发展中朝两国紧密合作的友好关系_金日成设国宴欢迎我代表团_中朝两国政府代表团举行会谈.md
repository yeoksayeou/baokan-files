    To further develop the close cooperative and friendly relations between China and Korea
    Kim Il-sung Hosts State Banquet Welcoming Our Delegation
    Government Delegations of China and North Korea Hold Talks
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th – Premier Kim Il-sung hosted a state banquet tonight to welcome the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai.
    In their speeches at the state banquet, Premier Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated their commitment to continue developing and consolidating the close cooperative and friendly relations between the peoples of China and Korea, forged in blood.
    In his speech, Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that the friendship between our two peoples has been formed and developed through a long period of common struggle. Today, the peoples of Korea and China are closely united in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and have formed close cooperative and friendly relations in the common struggle to defend socialist achievements and world peace. He said: "In the future, we will continue to strive to strengthen the fraternal friendship and solidarity with our close friend and helper – the Chinese people, and we will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the great Chinese people."
    Premier Kim Il-sung also said: "In the struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and to build socialism, the Korean people will surely strive for brilliant victories to gloriously defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp."
    Premier Zhou Enlai then delivered a speech. He said: "Since we arrived in your country, we have been surrounded by an atmosphere of warmth and friendship. Everywhere we have been warmly welcomed by the Korean people," "which has made us deeply appreciate the friendship and love of the Korean people for the Chinese people, and has also made us feel the warmth of the socialist family." Premier Zhou said: "There is a great friendship between China and Korea, not only because our two countries are neighbors as close as lips and teeth, but more importantly, because we both have the lofty ideals of communism and are members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. This great internationalist friendship is precisely the common characteristic of the relations between all socialist countries." This unity, after the meeting of communist and workers' parties in Moscow last November and the publication of two important declarations, has developed to a new stage, providing further guarantees for the cause of world peace and human progress.
    Premier Zhou expressed his belief that with the support of the powerful socialist camp, and with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the hardworking and brave Korean people will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve new and greater victories in their cause.

    继续发展中朝两国紧密合作的友好关系
    金日成设国宴欢迎我代表团
    中朝两国政府代表团举行会谈
    新华社平壤15日电　金日成首相今天晚上举行国宴欢迎以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团。
    金日成首相和周恩来总理在国宴会上致词时，再一次表示要继续发展和巩固中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的紧密合作的友好关系。
    金日成首相在讲话中指出，我们两国人民的友谊，是通过长期的共同斗争所形成和发展起来的。今天，朝中两国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭里紧紧地团结在一起，在保卫社会主义成就和世界和平的共同斗争中结成了紧密合作的友好关系。他说：“我们今后仍将为加强同我们亲密的朋友和援助者——中国人民的兄弟般的友谊团结而继续努力，我们将永远和伟大的中国人民并肩前进。”
    金日成首相还说：“朝鲜人民在实现祖国的和平统一和建设社会主义的斗争中，必将争取光辉的胜利，来光荣地保卫社会主义阵营的东方前哨”。
    周恩来总理接着致词。他说：“自从我们来到你们的国家，就一直被热情和友好的气氛所包围。无论在那里，我们都受到了朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎”，“使我们深刻地体会到朝鲜人民对中国人民的友谊和热爱，也使我们感到社会主义大家庭的温暖。”周总理说：“中国和朝鲜之间存在着伟大的友谊，不仅因为我们两国是唇齿相依的邻国，而且更重要的，是因为我们都有着共产主义的崇高理想，都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员。这种伟大的国际主义友谊，正是所有社会主义国家之间相互关系的共同特点。”这种团结经过去年11月各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行会议和发表两个重要宣言，发展到了一个新的阶段，使世界和平和人类进步的事业有了进一步的保证。
    周总理表示相信，有了强大的社会主义阵营的支持，有了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民一定能够克服一切困难，在自己的事业中取得新的和更大的胜利。
