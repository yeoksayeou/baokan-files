    The Milk Fruit Tree in Uncle Ho's Garden
    By Our Correspondent Xiāo Guāng
    I had never seen a milk fruit tree before, but I often heard friends in Vietnam talk about it. Comrades who had come from the South, especially those who lived in the countryside, always spoke of milk fruit trees with great interest and infinite nostalgia. Even those of us foreign guests who knew nothing about milk fruit couldn't help but yearn for it.
    Friends returning from the South explained, "The milk fruit tree is to the southern countryside almost what bamboo is to the northern Vietnamese countryside." We had lived in the Vietnamese countryside and knew how important bamboo was in people's lives of labor and struggle: from bright, airy houses to waterwheels and farm tools for crops, from simple bridges to light fishing boats, from the ladders soldiers carried during assaults to the barbed bamboo stake traps, what could be done without bamboo? And in ordinary families, whether it was the old grandfather's smoking pipe, the baby's cradle, the young man's carrying pole, or the girls' coolie hats... all were made of bamboo.
    It is said that on the highways, along canals, and in front of rural houses in South Vietnam, milk fruit trees are often planted in rows. They have tall trunks and lush green leaves; they absorb nutrients and moisture from the fertile alluvial soil, and bloom with dense clusters of small flowers. Milk fruit is a popular fruit in the South, about the size of an orange, with juicy, tender flesh and a faint, sweet, milky flavor. Many South Vietnamese comrades spent their happy childhoods under these tall milk fruit trees, and many thirsty and tired soldiers recovered their strength after sucking the juice of milk fruit. During the war of resistance, the guerrilla government distributed milk fruit trees to poor farmers. Six trees were enough for a family of five to eat, and also to provide for children's schooling. In the enemy's rear areas, one could see scenes everywhere: children sitting under milk fruit trees watching the moon, listening to their grandmothers tell stories of the Jade Rabbit and the Cinnamon Tree. Girls husked rice under the milk fruit trees, and during the hot noons, farmers often lay bare-chested in hammocks under the shade of the milk fruit trees, chanting anti-war poems. Women often fed their young children milk fruit juice in the evenings, humming as they fed:
    Dear child,
    Eat well and sleep well;
    Mommy has to go out and won't be back until midnight,
    Mommy is going to fight the enemy!
    To protect our milk fruit tree to feed you.
    Comrades returning from South Vietnam will never forget the scene of the 1954 regroupment to the North. At that time, the villagers who had persevered in the struggle together for many years got up early and rested late to sew clothes and quilts and steam cakes for their beloved soldiers; they reluctantly saw them off for one stage after another.
    Batch after batch of regrouped soldiers boarded Soviet and Polish ships to go north. When the last group was about to leave, the South Vietnamese villagers were truly heartbroken. Everyone wondered: How could we send a living gift to Uncle Ho, so that our hearts and wishes would grow day by day in the North! After thinking about it, they unanimously chose the milk fruit tree. Thus, a young milk fruit tree followed the last group of regrouped comrades to a place more than a thousand kilometers away from their hometown.
    When this sapling appeared in Cen Mountain, it was immediately surrounded and watched for a long time by the South Vietnamese people temporarily gathered there. Although they had only left South Vietnam a few days before, the familiar milk fruit tree deeply touched people's longing for their hometown. Everyone praised the good idea of the villagers, but worried that it had left its warm homeland, and the old South Vietnamese farmers who had taken care of it all year round, would it be able to survive?
    Last New Year's Day, some Southern students went to the Presidential Palace in Hanoi to pay a New Year's visit to President Ho Chi Minh. They accidentally saw a small milk fruit tree in Uncle Ho's vegetable garden, and the children rushed over as if they had discovered a miracle. Was it not? A real South Vietnamese milk fruit tree growing together with North Vietnamese cabbages and peppers!
    The staff of the Presidential Palace, unable to resist the children's repeated requests, had to tell them the story of Uncle Ho planting the milk fruit tree. He said: "In the winter of 1954, the little milk fruit tree was sent to the Central Committee Office of the Labor Party by comrades regrouping from South Vietnam. When Uncle Ho heard the news, he sent someone to bring it to the Presidential Palace; he personally dug the soil, dug the pit, and planted it in the vegetable garden. In the first few days, when it didn't rain, Uncle Ho watered it every day. The tap water of the capital, like 'the rain of July,' sprinkled on the trunk and branches. Gradually, the leaves became more vibrant, and the new buds grew more and more. Despite his heavy workload, Uncle Ho came to the vegetable garden to do productive labor every day after work. And the first job was to take care of the milk fruit tree, pull out weeds, check for insects, and strengthen the roots... Only when he really couldn't spare the time did he entrust the task to the guards."
    The children's eyes were moist as they listened. They gently stroked the leaves of the milk fruit tree, as if touching the cheeks of a baby. Before their eyes, everyone only hoped that the milk fruit tree would grow up quickly, so that they could ask Uncle Ho to taste authentic Southern fruit.
    The story of Uncle Ho planting the milk fruit tree quickly spread among the Southern people.
    After that, when South Vietnamese friends talked to me about the milk fruit tree, they no longer spoke with regret, lamenting that I would not be able to see it before the reunification of the North and South, but excitedly told me: "A milk fruit tree from South Vietnam has grown up under Uncle Ho's patient care!"
    The excitement and enthusiasm of my friends could not help but make me feel that this was not just about a tree, it was almost like they were talking about themselves. And the care and love that the milk fruit tree received, wasn't it exactly what the Southern people living in North Vietnam felt in their own lives! Almost from the first day of the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, and President Ho Chi Minh began to lead and organize the people to prepare to welcome the regrouped compatriots from the South. For more than three years since the ceasefire, tens of thousands of Southern people have been properly settled in North Vietnam for work, study, and production. The Vietnamese National Assembly has also specifically discussed how to better settle the regrouped compatriots from South Vietnam. ...
    I am very happy to have the opportunity to see the milk fruit tree planted by President Ho with my own eyes before leaving Hanoi. It has taken root firmly in the ground and is about four feet tall. The fresh green leaves are verdant and fluttering gently in the breeze blowing from West Lake. There is not a single weed around it. Everywhere one can see the diligence and care of the cultivator. The milk fruit tree naturally reminded me once again of those friends who had returned from South Vietnam; may they grow as strong as it does and dedicate more strength to the struggle for the reunification of Vietnam.

### 胡伯伯园子里的奶果树

    胡伯伯园子里的奶果树
    本报记者　萧光
    奶果树，我以前没有见过，只是在越南常听朋友们讲起。南方集结来的同志，特别是那些家住在农村的人们，每逢提到奶果树，总是那样满有兴味和无限怀念，连我们这些从不知奶果为何物的外国客人，也不由得对它向往起来。
    从南方归来的朋友解释说：“奶果树之于南部农村，简直跟竹子是北越农村的象征差不多。”我们在越北乡间住过，知道竹子在人们的劳动和战斗生活中占着多么重要的地位：从明亮通风的屋子到庄稼用的水车、农具，从简便的桥梁到轻巧的渔船，从战士们冲锋时背的云梯到带倒钩的竹签陷阱，哪一样离得开竹子？而在普通的家庭里，不论是老爷爷抽的烟袋、婴儿睡的摇篮或是小伙子挑的扁担、姑娘们戴的凉帽……也无一不由竹子做成。
    听说，在南越的公路上、水渠旁，还有农村的屋舍跟前，奶果树常是排列成行。它们躯干高大、枝叶碧绿；从肥沃的冲积土壤中吸收养料和水分，开出一串串茂密的、小小的花朵。奶果在南方，是一种大众化的水果，它的个儿有柑子大，果肉鲜嫩多汁、带着一股淡淡的香甜的奶味。多少南越同志曾在这种高大的奶果树下度过自己欢乐的童年，多少饥渴疲劳的战士在吮吸了奶果汁后而恢复了体力。抗战期间，游击区政府把奶果树分给贫苦的农家。六棵树就足够五口之家的吃用了，还可以供小孩上学。在敌后根据地，到处都能看到这样的图景：小孩子坐在奶果树下看月亮，听老祖母讲白兔和玉桂的故事。姑娘们在奶果树底下舂米，而当炎热的午间，农民常敞着胸脯躺在奶果树荫下的吊床上，吟唱抗战诗歌。妇女往往在傍晚给小儿女喂奶果汁，她们边喂边哼哼：
    亲爱的孩子，
    好好吃好好睡；
    妈妈要出去半夜才能回，
    妈妈去打敌人呀！
    保卫咱们的奶果树给你喂。
    南越归来的同志是终生难忘1954年北上集结的情景的。那时，多年在一起坚持斗争的乡亲父老起早歇晚地为亲爱的子弟兵缝衣缀被、蒸糕做饼；依依不舍地送了一程又一程。
    集结的战士，一批又一批搭乘苏联和波兰的轮船北上，当最后一批人将要离开的时候，南越乡亲的心里真是难受极了。大家寻思：怎么能捎一件有生命的礼物给胡伯伯才好，让我们的心意和愿望在北方与日俱长！想来想去，竟不约而同地选中了奶果树。就这样，一棵幼小的奶果树就随着末一批集结的同志，到了远离故乡一千多公里的地方。
    当这棵小树在岑山出现的时候，它立刻被暂时集中在那里的南越人久久地围拢来观看。虽然离开南越没有几天，熟悉的奶果树却深深地触动着人们对家乡的思念。大伙儿称赞乡亲父老出的好主意，可又担心它离开了气候温暖的故乡，离开了常年看护它的南越老农，是不是能活？
    去年元旦，一些南方学生到河内主席府给胡志明主席拜年，偶然在伯伯的菜园里看到了一棵小小的奶果树，孩子们就像发现了奇迹似的飞奔过去。可不是吗？一棵真正的南越奶果树，同北越的大白菜和辣椒长在一块儿！
    主席府的工作人员拗不过孩子们的再三恳求，只得给他们讲述胡伯伯栽种奶果树的经过。他说：“1954年冬天，小奶果树由南越集结来的同志送到了劳动党中央办公厅。胡伯伯听到这个消息就派人把它带到主席府来；亲自刨土挖坑，栽在菜园子里。头些日子，不下雨，伯伯就天天给它浇水。首都的自来水，像‘七月的雨’一样洒在树干和枝叶上。渐渐的，叶子变得益加鲜绿，新的枝芽也愈长愈多了。尽管工作繁重，伯伯每天下了班都要到菜园子来生产劳动。而第一件活儿就是照顾奶果树，拔掉杂草、检查虫子、加固树根……只有实在抽不出身来的时候，才委托警卫员同志帮忙。”
    孩子们听着听着眼睛潮润了。他们轻轻地抚摸奶果树的叶子，就好像在摸婴儿的面颊。眼前，大家只盼奶果树快快长大，好请胡伯伯尝尝道地的南部水果。
    胡伯伯栽种奶果树的故事，很快就在南方人中间传遍了。
    这以后，南越朋友和我谈起奶果树的时候，已不再带着抱憾的口气，惋惜我在南北统一以前看不到它了，而是十分兴奋地告诉我：“一棵南越来的奶果树，已在胡伯伯的耐心照顾下成长起来了！”
    朋友们那种激动和热烈的神气，不能不使我感到这哪儿仅仅是指的一棵树，简直像在谈论他们自己。而奶果树所受到的种种关怀和爱护，不也正是生活在北越的南方人所身同感受的么！越南劳动党、政府和胡志明主席，几乎从和平恢复的第一天开始，就领导和组织人民着手准备迎接南部的集结同胞了。停战三年多来，几万南方人在北越或工作、或学习和生产，都被安顿得妥妥贴贴。越南国民大会也曾专门讨论过怎样更好地安置南越集结同胞的问题。……
    我很高兴能有机会在离开河内之前，亲眼看到胡主席栽种的奶果树。它已经牢固地在地里生根，长的有四尺来高了。鲜绿的叶子青翠欲滴，和着西湖吹来的微风轻轻飘拂，周围不见一根杂草。处处可以看出培植者的勤劳和周到。奶果树很自然使我又一次想起那些南越归来的朋友；愿他们像它一样茁壮地成长起来，在为争取越南重新统一的斗争中献出更多的力量。（附图片）
