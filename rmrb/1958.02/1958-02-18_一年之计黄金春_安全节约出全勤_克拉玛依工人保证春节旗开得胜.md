Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, February 17th: The Karamay oil region, frozen by ice and snow, is already enveloped in a unique early spring atmosphere.

Today, before the morning whistle blew, thousands of oil workers, under the bold battle cry of "Seize the golden spring of the year, resolutely break with convention during the Spring Festival, and guarantee safety, savings, and full attendance," draped in starlight, boarded shuttle buses heading to the worksite.

When reporters arrived at the Zhang Yunqing drilling team, which has always maintained the advanced title of safe and rapid drilling, the newly assigned derrickman had already climbed to the top of the derrick against the morning wind. The temperature at this time was more than twenty-eight degrees below zero. Mud and ice chips splashed under the feet of the drillers, and they were concentrating on fighting bravely to safely drill the first oil well in the second five-year plan five days ahead of schedule. Two oil extraction girls (two female cadres who had just been transferred from the office) on the construction site had their hair and eyebrows covered with frost and ice beads. When it was time to get off work, they resolutely refused to leave, occasionally operating the switches and gates on the oil well. When the foreman asked them to warm up, they held up their fingers and said, "We still have to produce twenty more tons of crude oil."

The workers of the Wusu'er (Uyghur) advanced and rapid derrick installation team, who had already prepared their New Year's plans, also automatically withdrew their leave requests that day. They took the lead in going to the most remote and arduous Baikouquan to install new wells. In order to save time and improve efficiency, the entire team moved to the snow-covered Gobi Desert to sleep in the open, aiming for a flying start during the Spring Festival and successfully installing a new well.

    一年之计黄金春　安全节约出全勤
    克拉玛依工人保证春节旗开得胜
    新华社克拉玛依17日电　在冰雪封冻的克拉玛依油区，已经笼罩着特有的早春气氛。
    今天，早晨上班的汽笛还没有鸣，数千名石油工人便在“抓住一年之计黄金春，坚决打破常规过春节，保证安全节约全出勤”的豪迈的战斗口号下，披着星光，坐上班车奔向了工地。
    当记者来到一直保持着安全、快速钻进先进称号的张云清钻井队的时候，新接班的架工迎着晨风已攀上云端钻井架顶。这时的温度是零下二十八度多，泥水和冰渣在钻工们脚下飞溅，他们全神贯注地在为提前五天安全钻成第二个五年计划里的第一口石油井奋勇激战着。在工地上的两位采油姑娘（刚从机关下放来的两位女干部），头发眉毛上结满了霜花和冰珠。到了下班的时候，可是她俩却坚决不下班，时而活动石油井上的开关闸门。当师傅叫她们去暖暖时，她俩将手指一比划说：“我们还要多干二十吨原油哩。”
    早已准备好过年计划的乌苏尔（维族）先进快速井架安装队的工人，这天也自动收回请假条，他们一马当先地走向了最边远、最艰苦的百口泉去安装新井。为了争取时间提高效率，他们全队都搬到大雪弥漫的戈壁滩上露宿，要在春节旗开得胜，安装成功一口新井。
