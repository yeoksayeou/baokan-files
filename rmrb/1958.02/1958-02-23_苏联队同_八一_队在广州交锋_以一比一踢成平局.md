    苏联队同“八一”队在广州交锋
    以一比一踢成平局
    新华社广州22日电　苏联国家足球队今天同中国人民解放军“八一”足球队在广州又以一比一踢成平局，上半场“八一”队曾以一比零领先。
    这场球赛几乎每一分钟都在紧张激烈的争夺中渡过。比赛一开始，双方就展开了猛烈的攻势。苏联队左边锋伊里因和左内锋布宗诺夫互相配合，曾多次快速切入对方禁区，准备射门，但都被“八一”队后卫阻截或挡出。三十九分钟时，“八一”队后卫长传一球，中锋冼迪雄在中场左边得球后吊向对方门前，左边锋崔亨燮迅速赶上劲射，球直飞入网，先得一分。此后，双方争夺更趋激烈，苏联队的主力队员奈托、布布金和伊凡诺夫等人虽然都没有上场，但是他们依然接连发动攻势，直逼对方禁区。
    在下半场比赛中，“八一”队门前屡生险象，三十七分钟时，因右前卫周兴犯规，被苏联队中锋谢孟良在发“角球”区附近发球吊中，中卫克雷热夫斯基赶上，用头将球顶入网内，比分成一比一。
    此后，苏联队攻势更盛，除守门员外，几乎全班人马都压过了中场。“八一”队力图求和，“死守”阵地，一比一的比数保持到终场。
    苏联国家足球队将在23日由广州乘火车去上海访问。
    又讯　苏联国家足球队在15日和16日，曾在广州先后以四比零战胜我国长春市足球队，以五比零击败沈阳队。13日，北京足球队在广州同苏联国家足球队以一比一战成平局。
