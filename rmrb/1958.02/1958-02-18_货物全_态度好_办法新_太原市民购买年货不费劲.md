Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th - Many residents of Taiyuan City say that this year they are having a thrifty and comfortable socialist Spring Festival.

In the past, as soon as the twelfth lunar month arrived, citizens began preparing for the Spring Festival. But this year, there are not much more people on the streets buying New Year goods than on a normal Sunday, and there are no long queues at the poultry, fish, and meat stores. A city-wide foodstuff market, the largest, which opened before the festival, receives more than 30,000 customers every day, but from morning till night there are no quarrels to be heard. The reporter met an old woman here carrying a full bamboo basket of New Year goods. She entered from the South Gate and exited from the North Gate in less than half a day, having purchased all the food for her family to celebrate the festival. She repeatedly praised the place for having abundant goods, being hygienic, having good service attitude from the sales staff, and having new methods.

In previous years, the most annoying thing before the Spring Festival was having to queue up to take a bath, get a haircut, or mend clothes. This year, thanks to the active improvements in the work of bathhouses and barbershops, this phenomenon has been eliminated. People can get their hair cut and take a bath in half the time it used to take.

About 10,000 service personnel in Taiyuan City started preparing New Year goods a month ago, and calculated the supply quantities of more than ten essential items such as meat, vermicelli, tofu, sugar, dates, and peanuts, and issued shopping certificates to the citizens. In this way, citizens can purchase goods in the market or from street vendors at any time, without having to queue up at all. During the supply period, in addition to generally extending business hours, various service departments also reduced the purchasing and payment procedures, set up temporary sales points, and organized staff to deliver goods to citizens' homes. Some stores also considered the needs of single men, washing the chicken and fish, making various kinds of good cold dish platters, and preparing dumpling fillings for sale. Zhao Quande, director of the Taiyuan City Urban Service Bureau, has been checking the supply situation in various streets every day recently. On the 14th, after he discovered a shortage of vegetables in the western suburban industrial and mining area, he immediately sent eighteen cadres to the wholesale department to transfer goods, avoiding a supply breakdown there.

    货物全　态度好　办法新
    太原市民购买年货不费劲
    据新华社太原17日电　太原市许多居民都说，今年过的是一个勤俭朴素而又舒适的社会主义春节。
    过去一入腊月，市民们就着手筹办过春节。但在今年，上街购买年货的人并不比平常星期天多多少，鸡鸭鱼肉门市部也没有长长的排队的人群。节前新开张的一座全市最大的副食品商场，每天要迎送三万多顾客，但是从早到晚听不到争吵的声音。记者在这里遇到一位提着满满一竹篮年货的老大娘，她从南门进去北门出来不到半天时间，就置齐全家过节的食品。她连连夸赞这里货物全、讲卫生，售货员态度好，办法新。
    往年春节前，人们最讨厌的是洗澡、理发和拆补衣服都要排队等候。今年由于澡堂、理发店积极改进工作，这种现象已经消除了。人们只花过去的一半的时间就可以理好发、洗好澡。
    太原市约有一万个服务人员早在一个月前就开始准备年货，并且把肉类、粉条、豆腐、糖、枣和花生等十多种必需品计算好供应数量，制出购物证分发给市民。这样，市民随时都可以从市场或沿街叫卖的小贩那里如数购到货物，根本不用排队。在供应期间，各服务部门除了普遍延长营业时间以外，还缩减购货交款手续，增设临时售货点，组织工作人员给市民送货上门。有些门市部还为单身汉着想，把鸡、鱼洗刷好，制成各种好菜拼盘，调好饺子馅出卖。太原市城市服务局局长赵全德最近每天都到各街道检查供应情况。14日，他发现西郊工矿区缺乏蔬菜后，立即派出十八个干部到批发部调货，避免了那里的供应脱节。
