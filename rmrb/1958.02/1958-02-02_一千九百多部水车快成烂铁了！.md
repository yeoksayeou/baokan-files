　　Over 1,900 Waterwheels Are About to Become Scrap Iron!
    In today's great leap forward in agriculture and major development of water conservancy, it's hard to believe that over 1,900 Liberation-style waterwheels are left out in the open, subjected to rust and the elements, with no one paying attention. But this is the truth. These waterwheels are currently behind the office of the Taiyuan City Machine and Iron Production Cooperative on Shengli Street, outside the North Gate of Taiyuan City.
    The story is this: A year ago, the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative ordered 2,700 Liberation-style waterwheels from the Taiyuan City Machine and Iron Production Cooperative. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative only took 770, leaving 1,930 unclaimed. At the time, some comrades exposed this fact, but no one paid attention. An official from the Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative's data department said, "We have known about this for a long time and are in litigation with the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative." Why didn't the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative take delivery? It is said that farmers in the province are not accustomed to using this type of waterwheel. However, why weren't they promoted to farmers during last year's severe drought? Obviously, this explanation doesn't hold water. The Machine and Iron Cooperative is also irresponsible. The director said, "The Provincial Cooperative has already paid for these waterwheels, and it is the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's business to take delivery. We are only responsible for making them and not for what happens after." It's strange that they say they are "not responsible" for matters concerning national interests!
    These 1,930 waterwheels are worth 230,000 yuan. Spending tens of thousands of yuan now could revive them, reducing the country's losses. It is hoped that the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the other involved units will not simply "litigate" and shirk responsibility, leading to these waterwheels becoming scrap iron!

### 一千九百多部水车快成烂铁了！

　　一千九百多部水车快成烂铁了！
    在农业大跃进、水利大发展的今天，居然有一千九百多部解放式水车还搁在露天之下，任随锈蚀、风吹雨打，无人过问。这话恐怕难以令人相信，然而是事实。这些水车现在还放在太原市北门外胜利街太原市机器铁工生产合作社的办公室后面。
    事情是这样的：一年以前，山西省手工业联社在太原市机器铁工生产合作社订制了二千七百部解放式水车，省供销社只取走了七百七十部，尚余一千九百三十部没有提取。当时就有同志揭发这一事实。但是谁也没理睬。省手工业联社资料处一个干部说：“这件事我们早已知道，正在和省供销社打官司呢。”省供销社为什么不提货？据说是因为这种水车本省农民不习惯使用。但是，为什么在去年旱情严重的时候，不向农民宣传推广？显然不能自圆其说。机铁社也不负责任，社主任说：“这些水车省社早已把钱付了，取货是供销社的事。我们只管做，以后的事管不着。”有关国家利益的事，说“管不着”，真奇怪！
    这一千九百三十部水车，值二十三万元。现在花上几万元，还能叫它复活起来，使国家少受些损失。希望山西省手工业联社、供销社等三个单位不要只是“打官司”，推卸责任，以致让这些水车变成烂铁！　张拴来等三人
