Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 25th – According to TASS, Parisian communists held a memorial meeting for Marcel Cachin on the evening of the 23rd. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez delivered a report on Cachin's life and activities.

He said that Marcel Cachin devoted his life to the working class, remained steadfastly loyal to socialism, and tirelessly fought for the welfare of the working people, for freedom and peace, and for the independence and prosperity of France. These are the fundamental characteristics of Marcel Cachin. He called on hundreds of thousands of working people to join the Communist Party in order to strengthen the party's ranks and struggles!

Thorez called on French communists to learn from Cachin, to be inspired by the glorious example of the October Revolution as he was, to be as heroic and disciplined as he was, to arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist theory as he did, in order to strive for the realization of the communist ideal.

    巴黎共产党员追悼加香
    多列士号召向加香学习
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎共产党员23日晚上举行了马赛尔·加香的追悼大会。法国共产党总书记多列士作了关于加香生平和活动的报告。
    他说，马赛尔·加香把他的毕生精力献给了工人阶级。坚定不移地忠于社会主义。孜孜不倦地为劳动人民福利、为自由和和平、为法国的独立和富强而奋斗，是马赛尔·加香的基本特点。他号召成千上万的劳动人民加入共产党，以便加强党的队伍和斗争！
    多列士要求法国共产党员向加香学习，像他那样为十月革命的光荣范例所鼓舞，像他那样英勇和守纪律，以他为榜样用马克思列宁主义理论武装自己，以争取共产主义理想的实现。
