Let the Land Be Universally Greened, Transforming the Landscape of the Motherland
Spring Afforestation Progresses Rapidly in Various Regions

(Our dispatch) This year, spring afforestation in various regions started early and progressed rapidly. This time last year, spring afforestation in various regions had just begun, but now Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou and other provinces have completed 16,490,000 mu.

This year, all provinces have paid attention to concentrated and contiguous afforestation, and have closely coordinated afforestation with water conservancy construction. At present, 424 forest cooperatives with thousands of mu each, and 16 forest cooperatives with 5,000 mu and 10,000 mu each have emerged in Anhui and Hubei provinces. The area designated for concentrated or contiguous afforestation in Hunan and Hebei provinces accounts for more than 70% of the total afforestation area in the provinces. Shanxi Province requires that every county have a forest cooperative with 10,000 mu this year. Anhui Province plans to green 250,000 mu of barren hills on both sides of Chaohu Lake within three years. The Lu'an Special District of this province is building water conservancy projects on one hand and afforesting along the newly built water conservancy projects on the other. At present, the entire special district has completed more than 52,000 water conservancy projects, of which more than 39,000 have already been greened, accounting for 75% of all projects. Since Fujian Province launched a concentrated afforestation campaign from the beginning of Spring (February 4), the provincial Party committees have strengthened specific leadership, and the province has planted more than 1,180,000 mu of fir, pine, etc., approaching the amount of afforestation in the entire province last year.

Recently, according to the new situation of the broad masses enthusiastically participating in afforestation, all provinces (regions) are revising greening plans, and many regions have decided to complete the task of greening barren land and barren hills stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program within twelve years ahead of schedule. The original national afforestation task for this year was 64,200,000 mu, but the afforestation plans for this year recently proposed by only twelve provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, have reached more than 70,000,000 mu, exceeding the national afforestation plan by 11%. Anhui Province has now completed more than 4,420,000 mu of afforestation, overfulfilling the 1958 afforestation plan of 4,400,000 mu; this figure is more than the total afforestation area in 1956 and 1957. Now this province has added an afforestation task of 4,400,000 mu. Guangdong and Fujian provinces have both planned to basically green the entire province within five years. Guangdong Province is preparing to afforest 100,000,000 mu during the second Five-Year Plan period. At present, Gao'yao, Zhanjiang, Hepu, Huiyang and other special districts have formulated leap forward plans to green the entire special districts in two to three years. Jiangsu Province has put forward the battle slogan of "Greening in two years, consolidating in one year, and completing in three years," and will complete the planting of 1 billion trees around houses and along roads, rivers, and fields this year to realize the greening of "four sides."

    让大地普遍绿化  使祖国河山易色
    各地春季造林进展很快
    本报讯　今年各地春季造林开始得早，进展得快。去年这个时候，各地春季造林还刚刚开始，可是现在安徽、福建、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西、四川、贵州等省已完成一千六百四十九万亩。
    今年各省在造林中都注意集中地成片地造林，并且使造林与水利建设密切配合。目前，安徽、湖北两省已出现千亩林社四百二十四个，五千亩和万亩林社十六个。湖南、河北两省预定集中或成片造林的面积占全省造林总面积的70％以上。山西省要求今年县县出现万亩林社。安徽计划三年内绿化巢湖两岸荒山二十五万亩。这个省的六安专区一面修水利，一面在刚修成的水利工程沿岸造林。现在全专区已完成水利工程五万二千多处，已经绿化的就有三万九千多处，占全部工程的75％。福建省自立春（2月4日）开始突击造林以来，由于各地党委加强了具体领导，全省已营造杉、松等达一百一十八万多亩，接近全省去年造林的数量。
    最近各省（区）根据广大群众踊跃参加造林的新形势，正在修订绿化规划，许多地区决定提前完成农业发展纲要规定的十二年绿化荒地荒山的任务。全国原定今年造林任务是六千四百二十万亩，仅河北、山西、甘肃、山东、安徽、福建、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西、贵州十二省最近提出的今年的造林计划，即已达七千多万亩，超过全国造林计划11％。安徽省现已完成造林四百四十二万多亩，超额完成了1958年造林四百四十万亩的计划；这个数字比1956年和1957年两年造林面积的总和还多。现在这个省又追加造林任务四百四十万亩。广东、福建两省都已计划在五年内基本绿化全省。广东省准备第二个五年计划期内造林一亿亩，目前，高要、湛江、合浦、惠阳等专区已订出二至三年绿化全专区的跃进计划。江苏省提出“两年绿化、一年巩固、三年完成”的战斗口号，今年要完成四旁植树十亿株，实现“四旁”绿化。
