    Promote "Three Diligences" with Leadership
    Xiao Tong
    Comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced have become revolutionary slogans for promoting the leap forward in all our undertakings. Recently, some universities, secondary vocational schools, and technical schools have also launched this socialist competition in terms of running schools diligently and thriftily, producing diligently and thriftily, and engaging in work-study programs diligently and thriftily. Some departments have already begun to promote the "Three Diligences" with leadership.
    The close integration of education and production has many benefits. This is the socialist educational policy. Education departments and educators must attach importance to this policy, change their skeptical attitude, and conscientiously implement and promote it. Diligent and thrifty production, diligent work-study programs, and diligent and thrifty school management are good ways to implement the integration of education and production. They can combine learning and doing, mental labor and physical labor, so that educated youth can thoroughly get rid of the ideological influence of the exploiting classes who despise physical labor and physical laborers, and thus become laborers who have both socialist consciousness and culture.
    It is a great thing for secondary vocational schools and technical schools to implement a half-work, half-study system and gradually achieve self-sufficiency. Some school leaders are full of concerns, worrying that materials will not be supplied in time, products will not be sold, that the plan will not be completed midway, and that funding will be difficult to solve. There are always difficulties in doing anything, especially when things are just beginning, there will be more problems and difficulties. Some schools have already found solutions. The Party and the government will also assist in solving these problems. For a revolutionary, in the face of difficulties, he should despise and overcome difficulties with a revolutionary heroic spirit, and should not be frightened by difficulties. Success depends on human effort. As long as we muster revolutionary drive, resolutely mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and let the masses speak out, debate, and think of ways, methods will come continuously. It is entirely possible to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency. At the meeting of 73 technical schools convened by the Second Ministry of Machine Building in Xi'an, after visiting, learning, discussing, and criticizing various conservative ideas, ten schools, including the No. 221 Technical School, will achieve self-sufficiency this year, and the half-work, half-study and self-sufficiency plans of other schools have also been advanced by one to three years compared with the original targets.
    Work-study programs and half-work, half-study are basic measures to embody China's educational policy, and are also an important link in implementing the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results in education and promoting the development of China's education. All localities need to promote the "Three Diligences" with leadership.

    有领导地推行“三勤”
    筱桐
    比先进、学先进、赶先进，这已成为促进我国各项事业跃进的革命口号。最近，一部分高等学校、中等专业学校和技工学校在勤俭办学、勤俭生产、勤工俭学方面，也发起了这种社会主义竞赛，并且有的部门已经有领导地推行“三勤”。
    教育和生产密切结合，好处很多。这是社会主义的教育方针。教育部门和教育工作者要重视这个方针，转变怀疑态度，认真贯彻推广。勤俭生产、勤工俭学、勤俭办学，就是贯彻教育和生产结合的好办法，可以使学和做，脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来，使知识青年彻底摆脱剥削阶级轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的思想影响，从而成为既有社会主义觉悟又有文化的劳动者。
    中等专业学校、技工学校实行半工半读，逐步做到自给自足，这是件大好事。有些学校的领导同志却顾虑重重，耽心材料供应不上，产品销售不出去，怕中途计划完不成，经费不好解决。做任何一项事情困难总归是有的，特别是当事情刚开始做的时候，问题和困难会更多些。有的学校已经找到了解决的办法，对于这些问题，党和政府也将协助加以解决。对于一个革命者来说，在困难面前应当以革命的英雄气概藐视和战胜困难，不应当被困难吓倒。事在人为，只要鼓起革命干劲，坚决发动群众，依靠群众，让群众鸣放、辩论，想办法，办法就会源源而来。实现自给自足的目标是完全可能达到的。这次第二机械工业部在西安召开的七十三所技术学校的会议上，经过参观、学习、讨论和批判各种保守思想，二二一技工学校等十个学校今年就要做到自给自足，其余学校的半工半读、自给自足的计划也比原定指标提前了一年到三年。
    勤工俭学、半工半读是体现我国教育方针的一项基本措施，也是在教育事业中贯彻多快好省，促进我国教育事业发展的重要环节。各地需要有领导地推行“三勤”。
