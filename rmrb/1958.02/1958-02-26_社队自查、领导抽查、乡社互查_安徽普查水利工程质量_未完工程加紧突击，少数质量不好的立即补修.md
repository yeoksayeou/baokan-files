Self-Inspection by Communes and Teams, Spot Checks by Leaders, Mutual Inspection Between Townships and Communes
Anhui Conducts Comprehensive Inspection of Water Conservancy Project Quality
Unfinished Projects are Intensified with Crash Efforts, Minor Quality Defects are Immediately Repaired

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Anhui Daily: After completing the second 800 million cubic meters of water management tasks, Anhui Province has now completed more than three-quarters of the third 800 million cubic meters of water management tasks. At present, in addition to intensifying the rush to build unfinished projects, various localities are also conducting comprehensive inspections and acceptance of the quality and benefits of completed projects.

The inspection and acceptance of water conservancy projects in various places are generally carried out using the method of "self-inspection by communes and teams, spot checks by leaders, and mutual inspection between townships and communes." Throughout the province, the special districts and counties alone have successively organized 3,880 inspection teams to go deep into various places to promote townships and communes to compare against the "six guarantees" contracts, measuring the width, depth, and slope of each pond and dam to see if they meet the planned requirements, and using methods such as cone-hole water filling to test the quality of the project. The results of the general inspection and acceptance show that not only has the progress of water conservancy construction this past winter and spring been rapid, but also the quality and benefits of most projects meet the standards. Of the 17,852 projects completed in Shucheng County, 95% meet the engineering quality requirements. All 861 ponds and dams in Bailong Township, Qinglong District, Feidong County, meet the quality requirements. After inspection and acceptance, the few projects that did not meet the quality requirements were reinforced and repaired in a timely manner. The Dawa Reservoir of the Xinmin Commune in Xiaochi Township, Taihu County, had been completed for half a month. During inspection and acceptance, it was considered that this reservoir alone could not solve the problem of drought threatening the entire commune, so it was decided to build another Wushan Reservoir. In this way, the commune can completely eliminate drought this year.

After inspection and acceptance, qualified completed projects are rapidly establishing and improving management and maintenance organizations, and are beginning to store and conserve water.

    社队自查、领导抽查、乡社互查
    安徽普查水利工程质量
    未完工程加紧突击，少数质量不好的立即补修
    本报讯　安徽日报消息：安徽省在完成第二个八亿方的治水任务以后，第三个八亿方的治水任务又已完成了四分之三以上。目前，各地除对未完工程加紧突击兴修以外，还对已竣工的工程进行工程质量和效益的普查验收工作。
    各地对水利工程的检查验收工作，一般都是采取“社队自查、领导抽查、乡社之间互查”的办法进行的。全省仅专区、县两级就先后组织了三千八百八十个检查组，深入各地推动乡、社对照“六包”合同，逐塘逐坝丈量宽、深、边坡等是否符合计划要求，并以锥洞灌水等办法检验工程的质量。普遍检查验收的结果表明，去冬今春兴修水利的进度不仅是飞快的，而且绝大部分工程的质量和效益合乎标准。舒城县已完工的一万七千八百五十二处工程，有95％合乎工程质量要求。肥东县青龙区白龙乡的八百六十一处塘坝全部合乎质量要求。少数不合质量要求的工程在检查验收以后，都及时进行了加固补修。太湖县小池乡新民社的大洼水库已经完工半月，检查验收时认为单是这一座水库还不能解决全社受旱灾威胁的问题，又决定再修建一个吴山水库。这样，这个社在今年就可以全部消灭旱灾。
    已经完工的合格工程，经检查验收后，都在迅速地建立和健全管理养护组织，并开始蓄水保水。
