Double-wheeled double-share plows can be widely promoted
Zhejiang Agricultural Machinery Conference reaches conclusion after debate
    (Our report) Hangzhou - The Zhejiang Daily reports: Zhejiang Province's Agricultural Department, Industry Department, and other relevant departments recently jointly convened a provincial agricultural machinery conference. The conference focused on studying how to systematically and plannedly promote and use agricultural machinery throughout the province to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production.
    Whether the double-wheeled double-share plow could be promoted in Zhejiang Province was the most debated issue at the conference. Many representatives were skeptical about promoting the double-wheeled double-share plow in Zhejiang Province. They said the double-wheeled double-share plow was too bulky, could not plow sticky soil fields, could not plow small mountain fields, and there were no conditions for promotion in areas lacking cattle; even in areas with cattle, promotion would be difficult. In short, there were many difficulties, and they believed that the double-wheeled double-share plow was not as good as a wooden plow.
    But the facts are not like this. Comrade Wu Zuowang of the Jiaxing Prefecture Agricultural Bureau said in his big-character poster: "The natural conditions in Jiashan and Changxing counties are basically the same, but the situation of using double-wheeled double-share plows in these two counties is completely different. Jiashan County has 540,000 mu of paddy fields, which are plains and low-lying fields, and the land that can be plowed with double-share plows accounts for 70% of the total cultivated land; the county has 5,813 water buffaloes, and a total of 736 double-wheeled double-share plows have been promoted. Changxing County has 640,000 mu of paddy fields, with both plains and some mountainous areas, and the land that can be plowed with double-share plows accounts for 60% of the total cultivated land; the county has 8,198 water buffaloes, and a total of 291 double-wheeled double-share plows have been promoted. In the spring plowing of 1957, the double-share plows used in Jiashan County accounted for 68% of the promoted number, plowing 18,600 mu of land; the double-share plows used in Changxing County accounted for only 17.1% of the promoted number, plowing 2,750 mu of land. In 1957, Jiashan County promoted another six double-share plows, while Changxing County did not promote any, but instead blindly returned 275 plows. Why is this? The reason is that Jiashan County has achieved the following three points: ① Leaders go deep and have great determination; ② Technical training is good; ③ Specific problems are solved well. What is the reason why Changxing County did not promote it? We ask them to answer it themselves." His meaning is that this is not a practical difficulty, but rather a failure to resolve ideological problems.
    The representatives also used ample facts to prove that double-wheeled double-share plows can also be used in most areas of the mountains. Jiande County is one of the main mountainous counties in the province, but the Sandu Township and Three Cooperatives in this county bought a total of ten double-wheeled double-share plows in 1955 and 1956, and all of them have been used in the past few years. Especially during the autumn drought of 1957, the soil was hard, and wooden plows could not plow it, but later double-share plows were used, which plowed deeply and quickly, ensuring the timely sowing of autumn corn. Because of the educational effect of multiple yield increases, the cooperative members highly evaluated the double-share plow, saying that the double-share plow is a "yield-increasing plow" and no longer want to use wooden plows. In 1957, the cooperative added another seven double-share plows. In addition to Jiande, many mountainous counties such as Songyang, Longyou, and Qu County also have such facts.
    Can double-share plows really increase production? The speeches of the representatives from the Jiaxing area were the most persuasive. For the past two years, countless facts in the Jiaxing area have proven that all land cultivated with double-share plows has yielded more than land cultivated with wooden plows, regardless of whether it is rice or spring flowers. According to twenty-two comparative experiments in Jiashan, Jiaxing, and other counties in 1957, under the same soil quality, variety, fertilization level, and cultivation management conditions, continuous cropping rice cultivated with double-share plows yielded 8.4% more than rice cultivated with wooden plows, intercropping rice yielded 12.2% more, and single-season late rice yielded 13.6% more. According to experiments using double-share plows in rapeseed and cotton fields in the Jiaxing Agricultural Experiment Station and Jiashan, Pinghu, and other places, under the same conditions, rapeseed cultivated with double-share plows yielded an average of 58.7% more per mu than rapeseed cultivated with wooden plows. Based on the increased range of yield from comparative experiments in various places, calculated at an increase of 50 jin of grain per mu, the entire Jiaxing Prefecture has increased its grain production by 60 million jin in the past two years due to the use of double-share plows.
    Some people say: It is certain that double-share plows yield more than wooden plows, but the efficiency is not high, and it is not as good as two wooden plows. This statement is also not true. For example, the Qingfeng Cooperative in Fengtong Township, Jiashan County, uses double-share plows to plow weedy fields, and can generally plow 12 to 13 mu per day, and can reach a maximum of more than 18 mu, which is 20-30% more than plowing 10 mu of land per day with two wooden plows.
    After great debate, the conference unanimously affirmed the benefits of double-share plows and decided to promote 30,000 double-share plows throughout the province in 1958 and to ensure that they play their role. Finally, they also reviewed some of the shortcomings in the promotion of double-share plows in the past few years and proposed that they should strengthen the training of farm tool operators in the future, carefully select training targets, conduct more field operation experiments, and ensure that the cooperative's business management also keeps up. In particular, they must seriously solve the problems of cattle allocation and work points for farm tool operators.

### 双轮双铧犁可以普遍推广  浙江农业机械会议争辩后得出结论

　　双轮双铧犁可以普遍推广
    浙江农业机械会议争辩后得出结论
    本报讯　浙江日报消息：浙江省农业厅、工业厅等有关部门最近联合召开全省农业机械会议，集中研究了如何在全省范围内有步骤、有计划地推广和使用农业机械，以适应农业生产大跃进的需要。
    双轮双铧犁能否在浙江省推广？是这次会议上争论最多的问题。很多代表对在浙江省推广双轮双铧犁抱着怀疑态度。他们说双轮双铧犁太笨重，粘土田不能耕，山区田面小不能耕，缺牛地区根本没有条件推广，有牛地区推广也有困难。总之，困难很多，认为双轮双铧犁还不如木犁好。
    但是事实并不是这样。嘉兴专署农业局武佐望同志贴的大字报上说：“嘉善和长兴两县的自然条件是基本上相同的，但是这两个县使用双轮双铧犁的情况完全不同。嘉善县有水田五十四万亩，是平原低田地区，可以使用双铧犁耕作的土地占总耕地的70％；全县有五千八百十三头水牛，共推广了七百三十六台双轮双铧犁。长兴县有水田六十四万亩，有平原也有部分山区，可以使用双铧犁耕作的土地占总耕地的60％；全县有八千一百九十八头水牛，共推广了二百九十一台双轮双铧犁。1957年春耕，嘉善县使用的双铧犁占推广数的68％，耕了一万八千六百亩田；长兴县使用的双铧犁仅占推广数的17.1％，耕了二千七百五十亩田。1957年嘉善县又推广了六台双铧犁，长兴县没有推广，相反还盲目退犁二百七十五台。这是为什么？原因是嘉善县做到了这样三点：①领导深入、决心大；②技术传授好；③解决具体问题好。长兴县没有推广是什么道理呢？要请他们自己来答复。”他的意思是这不是实际困难，而是思想问题没有解决。
    代表们还用充分的事实证明：双轮双铧犁在山区的大部分地区也能使用。建德县是本省主要的山区县份之一，可是这个县的三都乡三社都在1955年和1956年两年中，共买了十部双轮双铧犁，几年来全都使用起来了。特别是在1957年秋旱季节，土硬，木犁耕不动，后来用双铧犁来耕，耕得又深又快，保证了秋玉米的及时播种。由于多次的增产事实教育了社员，社员对双铧犁的评价很高，说双铧犁是“增产犁”，从此不愿再用木犁了。1957年该社又增添了七部双铧犁。除建德外，松阳、龙游、衢县等许多县山区也都有这样的事实。
    双铧犁究竟能不能增产？嘉兴地区代表的发言最有说服力。两年来，嘉兴地区有无数的事实证明：凡是用双铧犁耕作的土地，不论水稻和春花都比木犁耕作的增产。1957年据嘉善、嘉兴等县二十二个对比试验来看，在同样土质、品种、施肥水平和栽培管理等条件下，用双铧犁耕作，连作稻要比木犁耕作的增产8.4％，间作稻要比木犁耕作的增产12.2％，单季晚稻要比木犁耕作的增产13.6％。据嘉兴农业试验站和嘉善、平湖等地在油菜、棉花田上用双铧犁耕作的试验，在同样条件下，用双铧犁耕作的，油菜每亩平均产量比木犁耕作的增产58.7％。根据各地对照试验增产的幅度推算，以每亩增产五十斤粮食计算，两年来整个嘉兴专区由于使用双铧犁而增产的粮食达六千万斤。
    有人说：双铧犁比木犁增产是肯定的，但是效率不高，抵不上二部木犁。这话也是不确实的。如嘉善县凤桐乡庆丰社用双铧犁耕草子田，一天一般可耕十二到十三亩，最高可以达到十八亩多，比二部木犁一天耕十亩田增加20—30％。
    会议经过大争大辩，一致肯定了双铧犁的好处，决心1958年要在全省推广双铧犁三万部，并且要使它们发挥作用。最后，还检查了前几年推广双铧犁中的一些缺点，提出今后要加强训练农具手的工作，慎重选择训练对象，多作田间操作试验，合作社的经营管理也要跟上去。特别是要认真解决耕牛调配和农具手的工分问题。
