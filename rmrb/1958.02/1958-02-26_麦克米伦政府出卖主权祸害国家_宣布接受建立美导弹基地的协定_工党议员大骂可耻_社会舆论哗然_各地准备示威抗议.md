(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency, London: The British government announced on the 25th an agreement signed with the United States regarding the establishment of American missile bases in Britain. This agreement grants the United States dual and ultimate control over missiles and nuclear warheads.

When Defense Minister Sandys announced this agreement in the House of Commons on the 24th, hundreds of people rushed to the House to protest the agreement. They demanded the abandonment of the plan to establish these bases. According to the agreement, all nuclear warheads of these American missiles "shall, in accordance with United States law, be wholly owned by the United States and shall be wholly in the custody and under the control of the United States." The agreement stipulates that "the decision to launch these missiles shall be made jointly by the two governments."

One clause of the agreement is particularly provocative to the people of Asian countries, stating that missile launch tests will not only be conducted at launch sites with equipment provided by the United States but also at the Woomera test range in Australia.

While announcing this agreement in the House of Commons, Sandys also announced that these American missile bases would be mainly built in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and the east coast of England. At this point, cries of "Shame!" erupted from the Labor benches.

The publication of the US-UK agreement on the establishment of missile bases, as well as the British government's earlier announcement of its decision to use nuclear weapons regardless of whether the Soviet Union used such weapons, has caused alarm and indignation among people in British society. It has been decided to hold protest demonstrations across Britain on March 1st.

The "Daily Mirror," the newspaper with the largest circulation among British dailies, criticized the US-UK agreement on the establishment of American rocket bases in Britain on the 25th, saying that the agreement was a "bad deal" for Britain.

The newspaper said, "It is a big mistake for the Conservative government to commit Britain to the establishment of joint US-UK rocket bases before discussions on disarmament at the highest level." The newspaper believes that the timing of signing this agreement could not be worse, given the prospect of a possible summit meeting.

The "Daily Herald" pointed out that the hydrogen bomb race is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the British people "are disappointed that the government insists on adding rocket bases to hydrogen bombs, even at the risk of undermining the hope of successfully holding a summit meeting." The newspaper criticized the British Labor Party and the Trades Union Congress for failing to lead the British labor movement in the fight against "nuclear madness" and called for a campaign to force the government to negotiate with the Soviet Union instead of escalating the hydrogen bomb race.

The "Worker's Daily" condemned the US-UK missile base agreement as a "suicidal treaty" for Britain. The newspaper pointed out that once rockets are used, "Britain will become a target for hydrogen bomb retaliation on a scale that will cause unimaginable destruction and loss of life."

An editorial in "The Times" pointed out that the United States is eager to deploy missile weapons in Britain for purely military considerations. However, the missile agreement is not something that can arouse enthusiasm. The newspaper said that the "Thor" missiles that the United States intends to deploy in Britain are "troublesome weapons that rely on a very complex fuel system." These weapons cannot be placed underground and therefore have only questionable value due to their relative vulnerability.

"The Times" also expressed doubts about the government's intention to build its own British-made ballistic missiles. The newspaper emphasized, "Before we irrevocably commit ourselves to a missile race that we cannot afford," now is the best time to withdraw from the nuclear weapons race.

    麦克米伦政府出卖主权祸害国家
    宣布接受建立美导弹基地的协定
    工党议员大骂可耻　社会舆论哗然　各地准备示威抗议
    本报综合报道　据新华社伦敦讯：英国政府25日宣布了同美国签订的关于在英国建立美国导弹基地的协定。这个协定给予美国以对导弹和核弹头的双重的最后控制权力。
    当国防大臣桑迪斯24日在下院宣布这一协定时，有成百的人赶到下院去抗议这个协定。他们要求放弃建立这种基地的计划。根据这项协定，所有这些美国导弹的核弹头“将按照美国法律完全为美国所拥有，并且完全处于美国的监护和控制之下”。协定规定，“发射这些导弹的决定将由两国政府共同作出”。
    协定有一条规定对亚洲各国人民特别具有挑衅性质，这条规定说，不仅要在美国提供设备的发射场进行导弹发射试验，而且还要在澳大利亚的伍麦拉试验场进行这种试验。
    桑迪斯在下院宣布这项协定的同时还宣布，这些美国导弹基地主要地将建造在英国东部的林肯郡、约克郡和英国东海岸。这时，工党议席上发出了“可耻！”的喊声。
    美英关于建立导弹基地协定的公布以及前些时候英国政府宣布它决定使用核武器而不管苏联是否使用这种武器这件事，在英国社会人士中引起了惊恐和愤慨。英国全国各地已经决定在3月1日举行抗议示威。
    在英国各种日报中销路最大的“每日镜报”25日批评英美关于在英国建立美国火箭基地的协定说，这项协定对英国来说是一宗“坏交易”。
    这家报纸说，“保守党政府在最高级会议讨论裁军问题以前就使英国对建立美英联合火箭基地承担义务是一个大错误”。报纸认为，鉴于可能召开最高级会议的前景，签订这项协定的时机是再坏也没有了。
    “每日先驱报”指出，氢弹竞赛正在变得愈来愈危险，而英国人民“对于政府甚至不顾破坏成功地举行一次最高级会议的希望的危险而坚持在氢弹以外再加上火箭基地感到失望”。这家报纸批评英国工党和职工大会没有领导英国劳工运动来进行反对“核疯狂”的斗争，它呼吁开展一个运动来迫使政府同苏联举行谈判而不是加紧氢弹竞赛。
    “工人日报”谴责美英导弹基地协定对于英国是一项“自杀的条约”。这家报纸指出，只要一旦火箭被使用，“英国就要变成氢弹回击的目标，其规模将引起难以想像的毁灭和生命的损失”。
    “泰晤士报”社论指出，美国出于纯军事的考虑而急于把导弹武器配置在英国。但是，导弹协定并不是什么可以引起人们热情的东西。报纸说，美国打算在英国设置的“雷神”式导弹是一种“依靠非常复杂的燃料系统的麻烦的武器”。这种武器不能设置在地下，因此由于其相对地容易遭到破坏而只有可怀疑的价值。
    “泰晤士报”对于政府打算建立英国自制的弹道导弹也表示怀疑。报纸强调，“在我们还没有不可挽回地委身于我们所无力承担的导弹竞赛以前”，现在是退出核武器竞赛的最好时机了。
