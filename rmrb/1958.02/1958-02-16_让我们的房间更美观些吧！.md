    Let's Make Our Rooms More Beautiful!
    Shi Genyuan
    Around the Spring Festival, after sweeping away dust and grime, everyone likes to decorate their homes to be more beautiful. How can we make our rooms clean and beautiful?
    Arranging a room requires attention to simplicity and cleanliness. Unnecessary furniture and odds and ends should not be crammed into the room; it will reduce effective space, make people feel cluttered and crowded, and also be a burden for sweeping dust and maintaining regular cleanliness. We can place the most needed pieces of furniture compactly in the room. Infrequently used boxes and sundries should be placed in the storage room and closet. If there is no storage room or closet, we should make full use of the space in the room and place them neatly under the bed or on top of the cabinet. Some things, like boxes, can be used to stack them into a platform, covered with a cloth, and used as a piece of furniture, isn't that interesting? In addition, you can also use lead wire and old cloth to enclose a wardrobe. Nailing clothes racks and lead wires behind the door and in the corners can make full use of it to hang clothes and towels.
    Sometimes, pulling a curtain to separate a large room into a small room and using it as a children's room or storage room is also good.
    When considering the color of the interior, attention should be paid to the coordination of the color tones of furniture, bed sheets, soft chair fabrics, and window curtains. The style and color of the indoor furniture are best matched consistently. Dark, light, angular, or rounded should be placed together as much as possible, so that it will appear neat and beautiful.
    Windows play a great role in the lighting, ventilation, and aesthetics of the room, and we can decorate them appropriately. Half-length curtains can be made of colored paper, printed cotton cloth, or printed linen cloth, and long window curtains from top to bottom can also be used. When the weather gradually warms up, lighter and simpler fabrics can be used to make window curtains, facing the gentle breeze outside the window, making people feel extraordinarily bright and beautiful.
    Decorating the walls with some pictures can make the room appear more beautiful and vibrant. The pictures can be mounted in simple frames or supported by cardboard; the height of the hanging is generally about the same as the eye level when a person is standing. If you want to create a tranquil atmosphere in the room, it is more appropriate to choose pictures and photos with content such as still life, Chinese paintings of flowers and birds, bright buildings, landscapes, and close-ups of people. Large-scale posters and too lively pictures will have the opposite effect, especially for smaller rooms. Too many wall hangings are not beautiful either.
    Some people like to fold up quilts and pillows and put them on the bed, which is certainly good-looking, but in order to maintain cleanliness and tidiness, it is also beautiful to spread the bedding flat and cover it with a blanket or bed sheet that coordinates with the color of the room. If conditions permit, decorate a net buckle or cloth tablecloth on the table or coffee table, or lay a piece of colored paper under the exposed net buckle to make the color tone of the room more harmonious. Some vases, stationery, alarm clocks or art crafts can also be placed on the table, five-drawer cabinet and bookshelf.
    Bright windows and clean tables, fresh air, and the room is elegant and refreshing, which will naturally make people feel happy. Through our own labor, we can obtain such a beautiful and comfortable environment, why not do it!

    让我们的房间更美观些吧！
    史根源
    春节前夕，大家在扫尘除垢之后，都喜欢把住房布置得漂亮些。怎样才能使房间整洁美观呢？
    布置房间要注意简单、整洁。用不着的家具和零碎东西，不要塞满一屋子，它会减少有效空间，使人感到凌乱和拥挤，而且也是扫除尘土，保持经常清洁的一个负担。我们可以把最需用的几件家具，紧凑地放置在房间里。不常用的箱子、杂物等，放到储藏室和壁橱里去。如果没有储藏室和壁橱，应该充分利用房内的空间，将它们整齐地放在床下或柜顶上。有些东西，像箱子等利用它们叠成台子，上面罩一块布，当成一件家具用不是很有意思吗？此外还可以自己用铅丝、旧布来围成一个挂衣橱。门后边、墙角处钉上挂衣架和铅丝，就能充分利用它来挂衣服和手巾了。
    有时拉一幅帷幔，把一大间间隔出一个小间来，利用它作儿童室或储藏室都很好。
    在考虑室内颜色时，要注意家具、床单、软椅布面、窗幔的色调应协调。室内家具的式样颜色，最好能配得一致些，深色的、浅色的、棱角硬的或较圆润的，应尽可能地让同一类的放在一起，这样就会显得整齐美观。
    窗户对房间的采光、通风和美观上都有很大的作用，我们可以适当地装饰它一下。用色纸、印花棉布、印花麻布等做成半截窗帘，还可以使用从上到下的长窗幔。当此天气逐渐转暖时，可用轻飘淡素一些的布料做窗幔，迎着窗外的和风，使人感到分外的明媚绮丽。
    在墙壁上点缀一些图片，可以使房间显得更加美丽而有生气。图片可以刊在边框简单的镜框里，或者用硬纸衬托着；挂的高度一般和人站着时的视平线差不多。若想使室内产生恬静的气氛，选用静物、国画的花鸟画、明快的建筑物、风景、人物特写照等内容的画片和照片较适宜。大幅的招贴画和太热闹的画面，均会起相反的效果，尤其对比较小的房间更不适宜。墙上贴挂得过多也并不美观。
    有些人喜欢将被子、枕头折叠起来摆在床上，这样固然好看，但为了保持清洁整齐，可以将被褥平铺，罩上同房间色调协调的毯子或床单也很美观。如果有条件，在桌子、茶几上复饰一块网扣或布的桌垫或者在露空的网扣下，铺一张色纸，使房间的色调更加和谐。桌上、五屉柜上和书架上还可以摆设一些花瓶、文具、闹钟或美术工艺品。
    明窗净几，空气新鲜，房间里又很雅致爽目，自然会使人精神愉快。通过自己的劳动，使我们能够获得这样一个优美而舒适的环境，何乐而不为！
