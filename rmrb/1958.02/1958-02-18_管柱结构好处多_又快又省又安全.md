The representative Wang Juqian suggested promoting the pipe pile structure. The pipe pile structure is the most important new technology of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project. By using this method, all work can be carried out above the water surface, avoiding harmful working conditions, being relatively unrestricted by water levels, and allowing bridge pier construction to be fully rolled out. Floating and transportation work is simpler, and less aquatic equipment is needed, thus not only guaranteeing the quality of the bridge but also shortening the construction period, saving investment, and ensuring the safety of workers. Several other bridge projects, such as the Minjiang Bridge, have also adopted this method. From the various projects and experimental work that have already been carried out, it appears that the pipe pile structure can solve various deep-water foundation projects well, quickly, economically, and safely. It is hoped that relevant departments can utilize and promote it.

I fully agree with the reports of Deputy Prime Minister Li Xiannian, Deputy Chairman Peng Zhen, Deputy Prime Minister Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. In the reports, as well as in the speeches of the representatives in the group meetings and the general meeting, I have heard about the great leap forward in all aspects of the country, which has greatly excited and encouraged me. Now, I would like to give a very brief report to the conference on the initial development and application of new technologies from the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project to other projects.

Among the new technologies of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project, the most important is the pipe pile structure foundation. The so-called pipe pile structure is to construct the bridge pier foundation cap on a group of reinforced concrete pipe piles. The composition of these pipe piles is to first sink large-diameter reinforced concrete pipes (the diameter of those used for the Yangtze River Bridge is 155 cm) through the sand layer at the bottom of the river to the bedrock, and drill into the rock within the pipe to the necessary depth. Then, a steel reinforcement cage is placed, and concrete is poured to form a pipe pile that is tightly connected to the bedrock. The load of the bridge pier is then transmitted to the solid bedrock through these pipe piles. By using this method, all work can be carried out above the water surface, avoiding harmful working conditions, being relatively unrestricted by water levels, and allowing bridge pier construction to be fully rolled out. Floating and transportation work is simpler, and less aquatic equipment is needed, thus not only guaranteeing the quality of the bridge but also greatly shortening the construction period, saving investment, and ensuring the safety of workers.

The pipe pile structure has been applied to other completed projects, such as the Minjiang Bridge on the Neijiang-Yibin Railway. The bridge is 352 meters long, and each pier in the water uses nine pipe piles with a diameter of 155 cm. The geological conditions of the Minjiang River include large pebbles mixed in the sand layer above the rock layer, which were not present in the Wuhan Yangtze River. Difficulties were encountered when sinking the pipe piles. Later, the stone-suction cylinder was improved, and the project was able to proceed smoothly, which further developed the sinking technology and showed that pipe piles can be sunk in pebble layers.

The pipe pile structure is currently being used in the following projects: (1) The Zhanghe Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, which is 667 meters long, is a double-track bridge. Each pier uses two pipe piles with a diameter of 360 cm, which reduces the number of piles and develops towards larger diameters, actually forming a thin-walled caisson that can be sunk deeper than ordinary caissons. The geological conditions of the Zhanghe Bridge are pebbles mixed with clay, which are tightly bonded and difficult to dig with a grab bucket. Difficulties were also encountered during sinking. After various methods were tested, the use of an air-suction dredger and a grab bucket alternately proved to be more effective. Although other tests are still being conducted, it has already been shown that sinking is possible. (2) The Hutuo River Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, which is 458 meters long, uses four pipe piles with a diameter of 155 cm for each pier in order to utilize the remaining pipe piles from the Yangtze River Bridge. (3) The Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, which is 2,800 meters long (this is the plan suggested by the Ministry of Railways in December last year, which is slightly shorter than the existing Yellow River Bridge; the State Construction Commission is still considering a shorter bridge plan, and the final length has not yet been determined). Each pier uses two pipe piles with a diameter of 360 cm. Due to the scouring conditions at the bottom of the river, the pipe piles need to be sunk more than 40 meters below the riverbed. The pipe piles at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge were only sunk about 20 meters, so whether they can be sunk so deep still needs to be tested on site. This is the development of the pipe pile structure towards larger sizes and greater depths. (4) The Mingshan Reservoir project in Hubei Province, due to geological fault conditions, the dam design was changed to use a pipe pile structure with locks. This type of pipe pile with locks was tested at the Yangtze River Bridge construction site and is now being used in a water conservancy project for the first time.

The pipe pile structure is currently being designed for the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge and the Nanchang Ganjiang River Bridge.

The waterproof cofferdam project for the Three Gorges Dam also has a plan to use a pipe pile structure in its planning, and plans are being made on how to carry out the experimental work. A few days ago, I also heard Representative Wang Huzhen mention that a certain project of the Sanmenxia Reservoir is also planning to use a pipe pile structure. In addition, we have sunk pipe piles with a diameter of 5 meters into the soil up to 30 meters in the hardest clay, which can be used as a reference or application for mine shafts. As for the main machine for sinking pipe piles, the vibratory pile driver, the vibratory force has been developed to 320 tons currently in practical use on the construction site.

From the various projects and experimental work that have already been carried out, we believe that the pipe pile structure can solve various deep-water foundation projects well, quickly, economically, and safely. It can be applied to bridge projects, water conservancy projects, and harbor projects. It is hoped that relevant departments can study and promote its application.

Of course, the development and application of the pipe pile structure also has a series of problems and difficulties that need to be studied and overcome. Although the Soviet experts who helped build the Yangtze River Bridge have gradually returned to their country last year, the Sino-Soviet cooperative scientific research base in Wuhan still exists and continues to cooperate with the Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Transport Engineering of the Soviet Union. This year, many new topics have also been stipulated. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, by diligently learning from the Soviet Union, and with the good unity of technicians and workers, we will definitely be able to achieve a great leap forward in new technologies, just like in other aspects, to accelerate our socialist construction.

    管柱结构好处多  又快又省又安全
    汪菊潜代表建议推广管柱结构。管柱结构是武汉长江大桥工程最主要的新技术，采用这种方法，全部工作都可以在水面以上进行，可以避免有害的劳动条件，相对地不受水位限制，桥墩施工可以全面展开，浮运工作比较简单，水上设备需要较少，所以不仅保证了桥的质量，而且缩短了施工期限，节省了投资，保障了职工的安全。其他几个桥梁工程，如岷江桥等，也都采用了这种方法。从已经进行的各项工程和试验工作来看，管柱结构可以又好又快又省又安全地解决各项深水基础工程，希望各有关部门能加以利用和推广。
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任的报告。在报告之中以及在小组会上和大会上代表们的发言之中，都听到了全国各方面的大跃进，使我非常兴奋鼓舞。我现在仅就武汉长江大桥的新技术初步发展地运用到其他工程上的情况，向大会作一个很简单的汇报。
    武汉长江大桥工程的新技术中，最主要的是管柱结构基础。所谓管柱结构是把桥墩基础承台修筑在一群钢筋混凝土管柱上。这些管柱的组成是先把大口径的钢筋混凝土管子（长江大桥所采用的是直径一百五十五公分）通过江底沙层沉到基本岩层，并在管子内钻岩达到必要的深度，然后放置钢筋骨架，灌以混凝土，使成为管柱并与岩盘紧密地连接起来，桥墩的荷载就通过这些管柱传到坚固的岩盘上。采用这种方法，全部工作都可以在水面以上进行，可以避免有害的劳动条件，相对地不受水位限制，桥墩施工可以全面展开，浮运工作比较简单，水上设备需要较少，所以不仅保证了大桥的质量，而且大大地缩短了施工的期限，节省了投资，保障了职工的安全。
    管柱结构运用在其他工程上而已经完工的有内江宜宾铁路上的岷江桥，桥长三百五十二公尺，水中桥墩每个采用一百五十五公分直径的管柱九根。岷江地质情况在岩层上面的沙层中夹有大卵石，这是武汉长江所没有的，下沉管柱时曾经遇到困难，后来改进了吸石筒，工程得以顺利进行，也就是下沉技术得到进一步的发展和说明了管柱是可以在卵石层内下沉。
    管柱结构运用在其他工程上而正在进行的有：（1）京广铁路线上的漳河桥，桥长六百六十七公尺，是一座双线桥，每个桥墩采用直径三百六十公分的管柱两根，也就是减少根数而发展到大直径方面去，实际上形成了薄壁沉井，比普通沉井可以下得深些。漳河桥的地质情况是卵石夹胶泥，凝结得紧密牢固，抓土斗不容易挖动，下沉时也遇到了困难，经过各种方法的试验，以采用空气吸泥机和抓土斗交互使用，比较有效，虽然还在做其他试验，但是已经说明了是可以下沉的。（2）京广铁路线上的滹沱河桥，桥长四百五十八公尺，为了利用长江大桥剩余的管柱，每个桥墩采用直径一百五十五公分的管柱四根。（3）京广铁路线上的黄河大桥，桥长二千八百公尺（这是铁道部去年十二月所建议的方案，比现有黄河桥的长度略短，现在国家建设委员会还在考虑短桥方案，长度尚未作最后决定），每个桥墩采用直径三百六十公分的管柱两根。由于河底冲刷情况，管柱需要从河底下沉四十公尺以上，在武汉长江大桥仅下沉二十公尺左右，所以是否能下沉如此之深，还需要实地试验，这是管柱结构向大和深的方面发展。（4）湖北省明山水库工程，由于地质情况有断层，拦河坝改变设计，采用带锁口的管柱结构，这种带锁口的管柱曾经在长江大桥工地做过试验工作，这是初次运用到水利工程上去。
    管柱结构运用在其他工程上而尚在设计中的有重庆长江大桥和南昌赣江大桥。
    长江三峡拦河坝的防水围堰工程，在规划中也有用管柱结构的方案，正在计划如何进行试验工作。前几天又听到汪胡桢代表谈及三门峡水库的某项工程也拟采用管柱结构。此外，我们曾经在最硬粘土中把直径五公尺的管柱下沉入土达三十公尺，对于矿山竖井就可作为参考或应用。至于下沉管柱的主要机具震动打椿机，目前在工地实用的已经发展到震动力三百二十吨。
    从已经进行的各项工程和试验工作来看，我们认为管柱结构是可以又好又快又省又安全地解决各项深水基础工程，无论在桥梁工程上，水利工程上，海港工程上都能够运用，希望各有关部门都能加以研究和推广运用。
    管柱结构的发展运用，当然也还有一系列的问题和困难需要加以研究和克服，帮助长江大桥建设的苏联专家虽然都已在去年陆续回国，但是中苏合作科学研究武汉基点仍还存在，继续和苏联运输工程部科学研究院进行合作，今年还规定了很多新的课题。我们相信在党的领导之下，努力向苏联学习，技术人员和工人很好的团结起来，一定能够在新技术方面也像其他各方面一样的大跃进来加速我们社会主义的建设。
