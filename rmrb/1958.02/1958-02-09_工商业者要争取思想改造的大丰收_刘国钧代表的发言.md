　　Industrial and Commercialists Must Strive for a Bumper Harvest in Ideological Remolding
    Speech by Representative Liu Guojun
    I fully endorse Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 state budget and the draft 1958 state budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. In their reports, Vice Premier Li and Vice Premier Bo used convincing facts to illustrate that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have victoriously completed and overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan. The construction of the motherland is developing by leaps and bounds at an unprecedented speed, fully demonstrating the infinite strength and great superiority of the socialist system. I am over seventy years old this year. I lived in the old society for decades and have lived in the new society for eight or nine years. Based on my own personal experience, I have seen the glorious achievements of the motherland in building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and I have seen the socialist camp growing stronger, more prosperous, and powerful. Contrasting this with the precariousness, poverty, and backwardness of the old China under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and contrasting it with the production decline and difficulties of the capitalist camp, I deeply feel that the new cause of the working people is like the rising sun, with broad prospects. The reactionary and corrupt ruling class is like the setting sun, gradually declining. This has once again given me a socialist education, and made me further realize how truly and with what profound practical significance it is to "listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road."
    Thoroughly Changing Political Standpoint is the Primary Task of Industrial and Commercialists
    Now, the glorious task of our people is to build socialism. As a class, the bourgeoisie is the enemy of socialism. To fully build socialism, the bourgeoisie must be completely eliminated. If we industrial and commercial people are to truly take the socialist road and devote ourselves to the cause of socialism, we must have a prerequisite: resolutely abandon the capitalist standpoint and stand on the socialist standpoint. If this problem is not solved, taking the socialist road and participating in socialist construction is just empty talk. Therefore, earnestly and wholeheartedly transforming ourselves, thoroughly changing our political standpoint, is a primary task for us in the industrial and commercial circles in building socialism.
    Some people in our industrial and commercial circles often have this kind of thinking: After the high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in 1956, our means of production have been changed from private to public ownership. The main symbol of the bourgeoisie is the private ownership of the means of production. We have handed over the means of production, so aren't we in favor of socialism, or even meritorious to socialism? In fact, this kind of thinking is wrong. First of all, we should not beautify ourselves. The bourgeoisie is an exploiting class and is not born in favor of socialism. It is undeniable that I believe that handing over the means of production was forced by the general trend and the will of the people, and was due to the Party's adoption of correct policies and measures. At that time, there were contradictions and struggles in the depths of our minds, and we did not try to weigh the gains and losses. Resisting socialist transformation is like an ant trying to stop a chariot, not what we wanted, but what we couldn't do; accepting socialist transformation, we could get fixed interest, be taken care of and arranged by the government, and be able to get what we want in politics, economy, and social status. Our children and grandchildren can also share the fruits of socialism and communism. In the final analysis, although our handing over the means of production is objectively beneficial to socialism, subjectively it is still for our own benefit. Besides, where did the means of production occupied by the bourgeoisie come from? We didn't bring the means of production from our mother's womb, and we "can't carry burdens on our shoulders, and can't carry baskets in our hands." We ourselves can't manufacture the means of production. Our means of production are the wealth created by the hard work of the working class. In the past, we exploited the labor of the working class and took the fruits of the working class's labor as our own; now, we hand over the wealth created by the working class to the state led by the working class, making it the property of the whole people, which is really as it should be. If we take this as a reason to be proud of ourselves to the people, it is really unreasonable.
    Changing Standpoint Cannot be Accomplished Overnight; The Bourgeois Tail Will Seize the Opportunity to Expose Itself
    My past understanding of this issue was also extremely one-sided, and even wrong. Since liberation, I have always thought that I was actively leaning towards the Party, that I sincerely supported the Party's leadership, and that in the process of socialist transformation, I was actively striving for transformation and following the Party and government's policies. I also thought that the bourgeoisie had handed over the means of production, which was almost equivalent to being transformed. Now there is only one more tail of fixed interest. As long as the fixed interest is abandoned, it will be considered passed. This shows that there is complacency in my thinking, and my understanding of my ideological essence is very poor. I take my transformation problem too simply, as if changing the standpoint is not a big problem, and ideological remolding can be accomplished overnight. This idea is really very wrong. After this anti-Rightist struggle and rectification education, I deeply realized that our national bourgeoisie has a dual nature in its political standpoint. On the one hand, although they are willing to accept the leadership of the Communist Party to varying degrees and are willing to take the socialist road; on the other hand, they have not yet fundamentally abandoned the capitalist standpoint. Especially when encountering specific problems, they are not completely convinced of socialism, the working class, and the leadership of the Communist Party. Precisely because the bourgeois essence has a negative and backward side, before the bourgeois essence has been completely transformed, given the opportunity, the bourgeois tail will be exposed, and the emotions of resistance to socialism and socialist transformation will be revived. This was most clearly demonstrated when the Rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party. At that time, I, like many friends in the industrial and commercial circles, not only did not resolutely safeguard the interests of the Party and the people, but also showed wavering and hesitation in the anti-Rightist struggle, and even resonated with Rightist thoughts, and even disseminated wrong opinions myself. This is a serious lesson, worthy of our serious vigilance! This shows that the bourgeoisie handing over the means of production is only the first step in transforming themselves. Eradicating the bourgeois ideological roots and changing the bourgeois political standpoint is still an extremely arduous task. Now, I further realize that when dealing with any issue, starting from different class angles and for different class interests, there will be different standpoints and attitudes. If we still stand on the bourgeois standpoint, we will inevitably start from the interests of capitalism, at the expense of weakening and undermining the interests of socialism; we will inevitably not actively participate in building socialism, but want to develop capitalism and engage in capitalist restoration activities. In this great historical period when the people of the whole country are striving to build socialism, whoever insists on the capitalist standpoint, whoever wants to restore capitalism, whoever wants socialism to regress to capitalism, whoever wants to run counter to the socialist road, will inevitably be opposed by the people of the whole country, making themselves enemies of the people, sinners of socialism, and crushed under the wheels of history.
    In the Exciting Socialist Upsurge, We Must Work Hard and Practically Together with the People of the Whole Country
    Now, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are overcoming all difficulties, riding the wind and waves, advancing triumphantly on the road to strive for a new leap forward in the national economy in 1958, and striving to realize the agricultural development program ahead of schedule, and striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other important industrial outputs in fifteen years or a little longer, carrying out creative labor, and setting off a new production upsurge. In this exciting socialist construction upsurge, we industrial and commercialists must throw ourselves into this upsurge and complete two tasks at the same time. On the one hand, we must, together with the people of the whole country, work hard and practically with a hundredfold of enthusiasm, and actively do our work well in our own work posts. What we are doing is the socialist construction undertaking that competes with imperialism for time and speed. We want to change the poor and backward face of the motherland in a relatively short period of time. We want to create happiness for future generations. It is impossible without a fiery enthusiasm. On the other hand, we must also actively participate in rectification and study, further transform ourselves, resolutely change our political standpoint, thoroughly transform our ideological essence, and make ourselves a veritable laborer, who can gradually possess the political standpoint and ideological qualities of the working people, and strive for a bumper harvest in ideological remolding, and strive for a great leap forward in ideological remolding!

　　工商业者要争取思想改造的大丰收
    刘国钧代表的发言
    我完全拥护李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告、吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告。李副总理和薄副总理在他们的报告中，用令人信服的事实，说明我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，已经胜利地完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划。祖国的建设事业，正以一日千里的速度飞跃发展，充分地表现了社会主义制度的无限的力量和巨大优越性。我今年七十多岁了，生长在旧社会几十年，在新社会中也已生活了八、九年，以我自己的亲身经历，看到祖国在共产党和毛主席领导下建设社会主义的光辉成就，看到社会主义阵营日益生长壮大、繁荣富强；再对照旧中国在国民党反动统治下的风雨飘摇、贫困落后，对照资本主义阵营的生产衰退、困难重重，使我深深的感觉到：劳动人民的新兴事业，好比旭日东升，前途广阔；反动腐朽的统治阶级，总似夕阳西下，日趋没落。这使我再一次地受到了社会主义教育，使我更进一步地体会到：“听毛主席话、跟共产党走、走社会主义道路”，是怎样的千真万确，具有无比深刻的实际意义。
    彻底地改变政治立场  是工商业者首要任务
    现在，我们全国人民的光荣任务是建设社会主义。作为一个阶级来说，资产阶级是社会主义的敌人。要社会主义全部建成，就要资产阶级彻底消灭。我们工商业者要能真正地走社会主义道路，投身于社会主义事业，就要具备一个先决条件：坚决地抛弃资本主义立场，站到社会主义立场上来。这个问题不解决，走社会主义道路，参加社会主义建设，无异是一句空话。因此，认真地、脱胎换骨洗心涤肺地改造自己，彻底地改变自己的政治立场，是我们工商界人士在建设社会主义中的一个首要任务。
    我们工商界中常有人存在这样的思想：在一九五六年对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的高潮以后，我们的生产资料已经由私有变为公有，作为资产阶级的主要标志是生产资料的私有，我们交出了生产资料，还不是赞成社会主义甚至是有功于社会主义吗？其实，这样的思想是错误的。首先，我们不要美化自己。资产阶级是一个剥削阶级，不是天生就赞成社会主义的。毋庸讳言：我认为交出生产资料，是迫于大势所趋、人心所向，是由于党采取了正确的政策措施。当时我们的思想深处不是没有矛盾、没有斗争的，我们也未尝没有权衡过利害得失。抗拒社会主义改造是螳臂挡车，非所不欲，乃所不能；接受社会主义改造，自己可以拿到定息，可以得到政府的照顾和安排，在政治上、经济上、社会地位上都能各得其所，自己和子孙还可以分享社会主义和共产主义的果实。归根到底，我们交出生产资料，客观上虽然是对社会主义有利的，但在主观上还是为了更有利于自己。何况，资产阶级所占有的生产资料是哪里来的呢？我们没有从娘肚里带来生产资料，我们“肩不能挑担，手不能提篮”，自己也制造不出生产资料。我们的生产资料是工人阶级辛勤劳动创造的财富。以前，我们剥削了工人阶级的劳动，把工人阶级的劳动成果据为己有；现在，我们把工人阶级创造的财富，交给工人阶级领导的国家，使之成为全民的财产，真是理所当然。如果我们以此向人民居功自傲，实在是毫无道理的事。
    改变立场不可能一蹴而就  资产阶级尾巴会伺机暴露
    我过去对这一问题的认识，也是异常片面的，乃至是有错误的。解放以来，我总以为我是积极向党靠拢的，对党的领导是竭诚拥护的，在社会主义改造过程中，是积极争取改造、遵循党和政府的方针政策办事的。我还以为资产阶级交出了生产资料，就等于改造得差不多了，现在不过只多一条拿定息的尾巴，只要定息一放弃，就算过关了。这就说明我思想上存在自满情绪，对自己的思想本质认识很差。我把自己的改造问题看得太简单，好像改变立场不是一个大问题，思想改造可以一蹴而就。这种想法真是大错特错了。经过这次反右派斗争和整风教育，使我深刻地认识到，我们民族资产阶级在政治立场上存在着两面性。一方面，虽然在不同程度上愿意接受共产党的领导，愿意走社会主义道路；但是，在另一方面，还没有基本上抛弃资本主义立场，特别是在碰到具体问题的时候，对于社会主义、工人阶级和共产党的领导，还不是完全心悦诚服。正由于资产阶级本质存在着消极落后的一面，在资产阶级本质没有完全得到改造以前，一有机会，资产阶级的尾巴就会暴露出来，对于社会主义和社会主义改造的抗拒情绪，就会死灰复燃。这在右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，表现得最为明朗。当时，我和很多工商界朋友一样，不仅没有坚决维护党和人民的利益，且在反右派斗争中表现得动摇、犹豫，而且还和右派思想共鸣，甚至自己也散发了错误言论。这是一个严重的教训，值得我们严重地警惕！这说明了：资产阶级交出了生产资料，只是完成了改造自己的第一步。拔除资产阶级的思想根子，改变资产阶级的治政立场，还是一个异常艰巨的任务。现在，我进一步地认识到：对待任何问题，从不同的阶级角度出发，为了不同的阶级利益，就有不同的立场和态度。我们如果仍然站在资产阶级立场上，就必然要从资本主义利益出发，不惜削弱和破坏社会主义利益；就必然不是积极参加建设社会主义，而是想发展资本主义，搞资本主义的复辟活动。在这全国人民努力建设社会主义的伟大历史时期，谁要坚持资本主义立场，谁要想使资本主义复辟，谁就是要社会主义向资本主义倒退，谁要与社会主义道路背道而驰，谁就必然要遭受全国人民的反对，使自己成为人民的公敌，社会主义的罪人，在历史的车轮下被粉碎。
    在激动人心的社会主义高潮中  要和全国人民一道苦干、实干
    现在，全国人民正在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，排除万难，乘风破浪，在争取一九五八年国民经济新的跃进道路上高歌迈进，为争取提前实现农业发展纲要，为争取在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产量方面赶上或者超过英国，进行创造性的劳动，掀起一个新的生产高潮。在这个激动人心的社会主义建设高潮中，我们工商业者一定要投入这个高潮中去，同时完成两个任务。一方面，我们要和全国人民一道，以百倍的干劲，苦干、实干，在自己的工作岗位上，积极做好工作。我们干的是和帝国主义争比时间比速度的社会主义建设事业，我们要在较短时期内改变祖国的贫困落后面貌，我们要为子孙万代造福，没有一股火热的干劲是不行的。另一方面，我们还要积极参加整风学习，进一步改造自己，坚决地改变自己的政治立场，彻底地改造自己的思想本质，使自己成为一个名副其实的劳动者，能够逐步具有劳动人民的政治立场和思想品质，争取在思想改造中大丰收，争取在思想改造中大跃进！
