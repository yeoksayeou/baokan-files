Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 16th - The Asian-African Women's Conference held its first plenary session this morning. Women representatives from Asian and African countries, in their speeches, emphasized the role played by women in maintaining the cause of peace and introduced the achievements of women in national construction.

    Indonesian women's delegation leader, Santoso, in her speech, appealed to the conference to assist the Indonesian people in eliminating the current situation created by the imperialists and to support their struggle to recover West Irian. She demanded that atomic energy not be used for destructive purposes. She also said that the Bandung spirit would help strengthen world peace and cooperation.

    Tahi'a Muhammad, representative of the United Arab Republic, spoke of the various restrictions on women during colonial rule and the situation of women after the country achieved independence.

    Ceylon women's representative, De Mel, talked about how Ceylon women are striving to deal with women's issues left over from colonialism.

    Indian women's delegation leader, Mrs. Menon, introduced the new rights enjoyed by Indian women after the country's independence.

    Burmese women's delegation leader, Du Qingla, also compared the situation of women during British rule with that after Burma's independence.

    Afghan women's representative, Mrs. Slayoui, said that the most important issue at present is to guarantee world peace and strengthen mutual understanding and cooperation among the peoples of the world. She praised the convening of the Bandung Conference, which gave Asian and African women the opportunity to discuss women's issues.

    Shi Liang, head of the Chinese delegation, also spoke at the meeting.

    After the representatives of each delegation spoke, Pakistani representative, Zeenat Rashid Ahmed, gave a report on education issues in Asian and African countries. In her report, she pointed out the backwardness that still exists in education in Asian and African countries, as well as the progress made since achieving political freedom. In her report, she called for the rights of Asian and African women and children and the equal right to education. Subsequently, the Japanese representative gave a supplementary report on education issues.

    When the observer of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization was invited to report on education issues at the meeting, the Chinese women's delegation left the meeting. Shi Liang, head of the Chinese women's delegation, had already pointed out in her speech that because the United Nations and its specialized agencies have deprived China of its legitimate rights in the United Nations, the Chinese delegation could not listen to the various reports made by the United Nations and its specialized agencies at this meeting. At the morning plenary session, congratulatory messages sent to the conference by women and organizations from various countries, including Soong Ching Ling and the All-China Women's Federation, were also read out. This afternoon, the meeting discussed education issues.
