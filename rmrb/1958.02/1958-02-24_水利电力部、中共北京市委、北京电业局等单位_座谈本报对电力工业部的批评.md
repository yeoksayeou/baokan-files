The Water Conservancy and Electric Power Ministry, CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, Beijing Electric Power Bureau, and other units
Discuss this newspaper's criticism of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry
Everyone believes that this criticism has promoted the work of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Beijing Electric Power Bureau; however, some of the content of the criticism is inconsistent with the facts.

This newspaper reports: The Water Conservancy and Electric Power Ministry, the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, the Beijing Electric Power Administration Bureau, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, the National Committee of the Electric Power Workers' Union, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and this newspaper held a discussion on the 16th at the Shijingshan Power Plant regarding the criticism published in this newspaper on February 8th, "The Shijingshan Power Plant's initiative of relying on the masses to reform unreasonable systems has spread throughout the country, but the Ministry of Electric Power Industry remains indifferent."

At the discussion, everyone exchanged opinions in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Everyone believed that the basic spirit of this newspaper's report was correct in criticizing the Ministry of Electric Power Industry for not promptly summarizing the experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant and not promptly organizing relevant enterprises to send people to observe and learn. The criticism of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau (in the news report, mistakenly referred to as the Beijing Electric Power Administration Bureau) was also in line with the facts. However, some of the content in the news report was inconsistent with the facts.

Comrade Liu Lanbo, former Minister of the Electric Power Industry, said in his speech: This criticism from the People's Daily of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry is timely and helpful to our work. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry indeed did not provide enough support for the reform of the Shijingshan Power Plant and did not promptly summarize it and organize relevant enterprises to learn from it. Comrade Liu Lanbo believed that this criticism promoted the work of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. Comrade Liu Lanbo said that after the newspaper published the criticism, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry held two meetings to discuss it and took two measures. First, the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Beijing Electric Power Bureau went to the Shijingshan Power Plant on the 12th to hold a meeting with representatives of the workers and expressed their support for the reform of the Shijingshan Power Plant workers, and made a self-criticism of the shortcomings of insufficient support in the past. Second, all electric power bureaus and factories were notified to send a director or factory director in charge of managing welfare and reward work to Beijing before February 25th, and the ministry would organize them to visit the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Qishuyan Power Plant to observe and learn from their experience in relying on the masses to reform unreasonable rules and regulations.

Comrade Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, said in his speech: The Party committee must support the socialist enthusiasm of the workers and masses. However, the issue of workers' welfare is relatively complex. At present, reasonable adjustments should only be made to those welfare benefits that cause disunity among workers, based on the increased awareness of the masses. Because these issues involve a wide range, adjustments must be made cautiously, and political and ideological work must be done for the workers to raise their awareness through extensive airing of views, debate, and discussion, and be carried out on the basis of the workers' conscious and voluntary participation.

Comrade Huang Jinghua, Director of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, made a self-criticism at the meeting. He said that the People's Daily's criticism of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau was completely correct, and this criticism promoted their understanding and correction of shortcomings in their work. After the newspaper's criticism, they made two reviews within the bureau. The reason why they did not provide enough support for the Shijingshan Power Plant's initiative was because they underestimated the awareness of the workers and masses, fearing that things would go wrong, and their thinking lagged behind reality, so they did not promptly organize subordinate units to learn from the experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant. Another reason was that the Beijing Electric Power Bureau lagged behind the Shijingshan Power Plant in the steps of rectification. For example, the reform of unreasonable welfare benefits was not organized for serious discussions among the masses in time, so only partial reforms were carried out according to the provisions of the higher authorities, and the level of reform is still behind the Shijingshan Power Plant.

Comrade Wu Lengxi, Editor-in-Chief of this newspaper, and Comrade Nie Meichu, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Transportation Department of this newspaper, and Comrade Lu Chaoqi, a reporter, explained the process of publishing this news report at the meeting, and made self-criticisms of the shortcomings of the reporter and editor in the process of collecting and editing this news report, such as not carefully verifying the facts in order to speed up the process, and the lack of a sense of responsibility and one-sided thinking. The news report said that the Ministry of Electric Power Industry disagreed with the Shijingshan Power Plant's organization of workers to discuss the abolition of the system of using electricity without paying and the unreasonable safety reward system, which is not in line with the facts. Regarding the issue of the system of workers using electricity without paying, during the rectification campaign at the Shijingshan Power Plant, an assistant minister of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry went to understand the situation. When the factory party committee reported to him that the time was ripe to organize workers to discuss the abolition of this system, the assistant minister said that he would return to the ministry for research and then reply, but there was no reply afterwards. Not long after, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau issued a notice without the approval of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, which not only did not abolish the system but also expanded the scope of free electricity use. The news report turned the matter of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau into the matter of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. Regarding the reform of the unreasonable safety reward system, it happened in 1956. At that time, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry issued an instruction to modify this system, which lowered some of the original reward rates and also increased some. The Shijingshan Power Plant believed at the time that the original system was unreasonable and should be thoroughly revised. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry considered that the system involved a wide range and that a thorough revision was still difficult, so it did not adopt the opinions of the Shijingshan Power Plant. The news report in this newspaper mistakenly said that this matter occurred during the rectification movement. In addition, before this newspaper issued the criticism, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry had issued a "Notice on the Need to Reasonably Rectify the Reward, Subsidy, and Welfare System of the Electric Power Industry during the Rectification Movement" in November of last year, and circulated a notice in its internal publications praising the experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant. This news report in this newspaper did not mention this fact. The above errors were caused by the reporter of this newspaper not being serious and responsible enough in the collection and writing, not seeking truth from facts, and not verifying the facts with relevant units.

Also speaking at the discussion were Lu Yu, Minister of the Industrial Department of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, He Gaoming, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Electric Power Workers' Union, Lu Xiaohan, Deputy Director of the Labor and Wage Department of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, Ma Futang, Deputy Director of the Beijing Electric Power Administration Bureau, Li Ximing, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shijingshan Power Plant, and Zhang Guinan, Director of the plant.

### 水利电力部、中共北京市委、北京电业局等单位  座谈本报对电力工业部的批评

    水利电力部、中共北京市委、北京电业局等单位
    座谈本报对电力工业部的批评
    大家认为，这个批评对电力工业部和北京电业局的工作起了促进作用；但是批评的内容有一部分和事实有出入。
    本报讯　水利电力部、中共北京市委、北京电业管理局、北京电业局、电业工会全国委员会、石景山发电厂和本报，于16日在石景山发电厂就2月8日本报发表的“石景山发电厂依靠群众改革不合理制度的创举传遍全国，电力工业部对它无动于衷”的批评举行了座谈。
    在座谈会上，大家都本着批评与自我批评的精神交换了意见。大家认为，本报在这个消息中，批评电力工业部没有及时地总结石景山发电厂的经验，没有及时地组织有关企业派人去观摩和学习，基本精神是正确的。新闻中对北京电业局
  （新闻中误为北京电业管理局）的批评也合乎事实。但是，新闻中也有一部分和事实有出入。
    前电力工业部部长刘澜波同志在发言中说：这次人民日报对电力工业部的批评，是适时的，对工作是有帮助的。电力工业部对石景山发电厂的改革确实有支持不够之处，没有及时地加以总结和组织有关企业来学习。刘澜波同志认为这次批评对电力工业部的工作起了促进的作用。刘澜波同志说，在报纸提出批评以后，电力工业部曾开了两次会议加以讨论，并采取了两项措施。一是由电力工业部和北京电业局的负责同志在12日到石景山发电厂和职工代表开了一次会，表示支持石景山发电厂职工的改革，并对过去支持不够的缺点进行了自我批评。二是通知各电业局、各工厂于2月25日以前，派一位管理生活福利和奖励工作的局长或厂长前来北京，由部组织去石景山发电厂、戚墅堰发电厂观摩学习，吸收他们依靠群众改革不合理的规章制度的经验。
    中共北京市委第二书记刘仁同志在发言中说：党委对职工群众的社会主义积极性必须支持。但是，职工生活福利问题是比较复杂的。目前只应当在群众觉悟提高的基础上，对那些引起职工内部不团结的生活福利待遇进行合理的调整。由于这些问题涉及的面很广，在调整的时候必须慎重，必须对职工做好政治思想工作，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论，提高职工的觉悟，在职工自觉自愿的基础上进行。
    北京电业局局长黄靖华同志在会上作了自我批评。他说，人民日报对北京电业局的批评，事实是完全正确的，这个批评对他们认识和改正工作中的缺点起了促进的作用。报纸批评以后，他们曾经在局内作了两次检讨。对石景山发电厂的创举所以支持不够，一个原因是对职工群众的觉悟估计不足，怕出乱子，思想落后于实际，因此没有及时组织所属单位学习石景山发电厂的经验。另一个原因是，在整改步骤上，北京电业局落后于石景山发电厂一步，像改革不合理的生活福利待遇就来不及组织群众认真讨论，因此只根据上级的规定进行了部分改革，目前仍落后于石景山发电厂改革的水平。
    本报总编辑吴冷西同志和本报工业和交通运输部副主任聂眉初同志、记者陆超祺同志在会上说明了发表这篇新闻的经过，并且就记者和编辑在这则新闻采编过程中为了图快，没有认真核对事实，以及责任心不强、思想片面等缺点作了自我批评。这篇新闻中说，电力工业部不同意石景山发电厂组织职工讨论取消用电不花钱的制度和不合理的安全奖励制度，是跟事实不符的。关于职工用电不花钱的制度问题，在石景山发电厂整风期间，电力工业部一位部长助理去了解情况，工厂党委向他汇报时认为组织职工讨论取消这个制度的时机已成熟，部长助理当时表示回部研究后答复，但是以后并没有回答。不久之后，北京电业局没经过电力工业部批准就发出一个通知，不但没有取消这个制度，而且将免费用电的范围扩大了。新闻中把北京电业局的事说成了电力工业部的事。关于改革不合理的安全奖励制度问题，是1956年发生的，当时电力工业部发布了一个修改这个制度的指示，对原来的奖励率有的降低，也有的提高了。石景山发电厂当时认为原来的制度不合理，应该彻底修改。电力工业部考虑到这个制度涉及的面比较广，彻底修改还有困难，没有采纳石景山发电厂的意见。本报新闻中把这件事误说成是整风运动中发生的。另外，在本报提出批评之前，电力工业部曾在去年十一月份发出“在整风运动中对电力工业奖励、津贴福利制度需进行合理整顿的通知”，并在内部刊物上通报表扬石景山发电厂的经验，本报新闻中对这一事实也没有说明。以上这些错误，是由于本报记者在采写中不够认真负责、实事求是，没有向有关单位核对事实而造成。
    在座谈会上发言的，还有中共北京市委工业部部长陆禹、电业工会全国委员会副主席何高明、电力工业部劳动工资司副司长路肖韩、北京电业管理局副局长马馥塘、石景山发电厂党委书记李锡铭和厂长张桂楠。
