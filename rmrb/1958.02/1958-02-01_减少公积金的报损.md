Reducing Losses from Public Accumulation Funds
　　Sheng Qiwen

The increase in public accumulation funds of agricultural production cooperatives indicates an increase in public accumulation, which means the possibility of expanded reproduction. This is because agricultural cooperatives mainly use the method of retaining public accumulation funds to increase the purchase of fixed assets and expand capital construction.

However, in the past two years, the reported losses of public accumulation funds of agricultural cooperatives have been considerable. According to a survey of sixteen agricultural cooperatives in Laiyang Special District, Shandong Province, more than 48,000 yuan was retained in public accumulation funds in 1956, but more than 9,000 yuan was reported as losses in the same year, equivalent to 18.68% of the public accumulation funds retained in that year. Among them, the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Gushan Township, Rushan County, retained more than 1,300 yuan in public accumulation funds in 1956, but reported a loss of 1,061 yuan, accounting for 78.65% of the public accumulation funds in that year. Other surveys, such as those of nine agricultural cooperatives in Changwei Special District, showed a loss rate of 22.77%; a survey of six cooperatives in Liaocheng Special District showed a loss rate of 13.81%.

The reasons for this phenomenon are: damage to fixed assets (farm tools) and death of livestock. For example, the Xinjian Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe Township, Shouguang County, retained more than 4,900 yuan in public accumulation funds in 1956, but due to the death of one horse, one mule, one cow, and two donkeys, the public accumulation fund reported a loss of 640 yuan, accounting for 13% of the public accumulation fund in that year. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Jitai District of the same county retained more than 5,800 yuan in public accumulation funds in 1956, but due to the death of one horse, one mule, and two cows, the public accumulation fund reported a loss of more than 680 yuan, accounting for 11.85% of the public accumulation fund in that year.

In 1957, the phenomenon of reporting losses from public accumulation funds increased compared to 1956 in some cooperatives. For example, a survey of sixteen cooperatives in Laiyang Special District estimated that more than 57,000 yuan would be retained in public accumulation funds, but by the end of September, more than 13,000 yuan had been paid out from the public accumulation funds, accounting for 23.37% of the planned public accumulation funds, an increase of 4.7% in losses compared to 1956. The reported losses of nine cooperatives in Changwei Special District accounted for 27.81% of the planned retention, an increase of 5.04% compared to 1956.

In the production process, the wear and tear of farm tools and the illness and aging of livestock are unavoidable. However, with better operation and management, and with careful use, farm tools can be damaged less, and with good livestock feeding and management, weakness can be prevented and death avoided. Therefore, on the one hand, agricultural cooperatives must strengthen operation and management, thoroughly implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, establish strict systems, and strengthen labor discipline; on the other hand, they must strengthen ideological education for cooperative members and foster the idea of loving the cooperative. They should also combine rectification of the cooperative with concrete examples from the cooperative itself, and educate the cooperative members by accounting. Losses written off from public accumulation funds must have approval procedures and cannot be easily written off. At the end of the year, they should be announced to the cooperative members to solicit opinions; conversely, this can educate the cooperative members to cherish public property, reduce losses, and increase accumulation, which is conducive to expanded reproduction.

### 减少公积金的报损

　　减少公积金的报损
　　盛奇文
    农业生产合作社公积金的增加，就表示公共积累的增加，就意味着有扩大再生产的可能。因为农业社主要是以提存公积金的办法来增购固定财产和扩大基本建设的。
    但在过去两年中，农业社公积金报损的数字是不小的。据山东莱阳专区十六个农业社的调查，1956年公积金共扣留四万八千多元，而当年就报损了九千多元，等于当年扣留公积金的18.68％；其中乳山县孤山乡星光农业社1956年扣留公积金一千三百多元，却报损了一千零六十一元，占当年公积金的78.65％。其他如昌潍专区九个农业社的调查，报损率占22.77％；聊城专区六个社的调查，报损率占13.81％。
    发生这种现象的原因是：固定财产——农具的损坏、牲畜的死亡。例如寿光县南河乡新建农业社1956年扣留公积金四千九百多元，因死马一头、骡子一头、牛一头、驴两头，公积金报损六百四十元，占当年公积金的13％；该县纪台区五星农业社，1956年扣留公积金五千八百多元，因死马一头、骡子一头、牛二头，公积金报损六百八十多元，占当年公积金的11.85％。
    1957年在某些社来说，公积金报损现象比1956年还有增加。如莱阳专区十六个社的调查预计扣留公积金五万七千多元，而到9月底已从公积金中付出一万三千多元，占预留公积金的23.37％，比1956年损失增加4.7％。昌潍专区九个社报损占预留27.81％，比1956年增加5.04％。
    在生产过程中，农具的旧损、牲畜的病老，是不可避免的。但是经营管理较好，使用时爱护，农具就可少损坏，牲畜饲养管理得好，就可防止瘦弱避免死亡。因此，农业社一方面必须加强经营管理，深入贯彻勤俭办社方针，制订严格制度，加强劳动纪律；另一方面必须加强对社员的思想教育，树立爱社思想。并应结合整社，以本社具体实例，通过算账，对社员进行教育。对于从公积金报销的损失，要有批准手续，不能轻易从公积金中报损，年终应向社员公布，让社员提意见；反过来又可以教育社员爱护公共财产，减少报损，增加积累，以利于扩大再生产。
