　　Drama and Film Go to the Countryside and Mountains
    Jiangxi Farmers Watch Zhou Xinfang's Play
    On the afternoon of January 23rd, Mr. Zhou Xinfang, director of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre and famous playwright, who was on a tour performance in Nanchang City, led actors from the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre and the Xinmin Peking Opera Troupe to Wangchenggang in Xinjian County to perform for the farmers. This news had spread among the farmers four days prior, and they anxiously awaited the chance to see the play. When Mr. Zhou Xinfang arrived, even before dark, many members from more than thirty agricultural cooperatives around Wangchenggang, as well as some farmers from twenty li away, rushed to see the play. More than three thousand people packed a spacious auditorium.
    That day, they performed "Beating Yan Song" and "Sisters-in-Law Sword Competition," both excellent programs. "Beating Yan Song" is one of Mr. Zhou's signature performances. When he, playing Zou Yinglong, appeared on stage, the audience applauded enthusiastically several times. Although there were many people that day, the order was very good; although it was cold, the atmosphere in the auditorium was very warm. Everyone was captivated by Mr. Zhou's outstanding artistic performance. After the play, one farmer ran onto the stage and warmly shook hands with Mr. Zhou to express his thanks, and the audience below erupted in thunderous applause.

　　Shijiazhuang Prefecture Pingju Troupe Performs in the Deep Mountains
    More than eighty actors from the Shijiazhuang Prefecture Pingju Troupe climbed mountains and waded through rivers to arrive in Jianping County, a mountainous area, on January 20th. They arrived at five o'clock in the afternoon, and the farmers, who had been eagerly awaiting their arrival, welcomed them with applause. An old man named Li, who was over seventy years old, said: "Since we parted ways in 1956, I haven't seen you again. Now that you're here, I'm going to watch my fill." The actors, despite their fatigue, performed that very evening, and the auditorium was packed with more than a thousand spectators.
    In order to perform for more farmers, the actors divided the troupe into two groups and went to perform in the deep mountains. On January 23rd, more than thirty actors, carrying their luggage, climbed over high mountains and ridges, and walked through muddy grasslands to reach Beiye. Beiye is a village surrounded by mountains, more than thirty li away from the county town of Jianping. In the past, no theater troupe had ever come here, and the farmers had rarely seen plays. This time, the actors set up a mat shed as a stage in the open air. Although the weather was cold, the actors performed with enthusiasm, and the audience watched with enthusiasm. The farmers were very satisfied. An old man named Liu, who was sixty-two years old, said happily: "An old man like me is lucky enough to see Pingju before I die! Who in ancient times has ever seen a city troupe come to a mountain valley to perform? This is truly a happy event that I couldn't even dream of!"

    Films Go to the Mountains
    To enliven the cultural life of mountainous areas, rural film projection teams in various counties of Jiangxi Province have been actively going into the mountains for mobile screenings.
    The Yongxiu County film projection team in the Jiujiang area, as early as the end of last year, carried their machines along mountain trails, regardless of the high cliffs and steep slopes, and climbed over high mountains and ridges to screen films in four newly reclaimed areas, including the Fenghuang Mountain Reclamation Farm, the Xiangtanxi Cultivation Farm, and the Luoshendian. In the past, these places were mountainous areas infested with wild beasts. The people who originally lived in the mountains had never seen movies before. After seeing the movies this time, they happily said: "The desolate mountains and poor ridges have undergone a great transformation, and a projector has been set up on the hillside."
    In order to further develop cultural activities in mountainous areas, the Jiangxi Provincial Bureau of Culture has decided that during the Spring Festival, in addition to the rural film projection teams of various counties continuing to go to the mountains, it will also draw cadres from three units, namely the Provincial Film Distribution Company, the Provincial Film Equipment Repair and Supply Station, and the Film Projection Cadre Training Class of the Provincial Cultural and Art Cadre School, to form three more film projection teams. From mid-February, they will go to twelve provincial-level agricultural, forestry, fishing, and animal husbandry comprehensive reclamation farms, including Jinggang Mountain, Damao Mountain, Wugong Mountain, Huanggang Mountain, Zhanggong Mountain, Yun Mountain, and Xi Mountain, to screen films, so that the masses in the mountainous areas can universally see new films.

　　戏剧电影下乡上山
    江西农民看周信芳的戏
    1月23日下午，正在南昌市作巡回演出的上海京剧院院长、著名戏剧家周信芳先生，率领上海京剧院、新民京剧团的演员，来到新建县望城岗为农民演戏。这个消息，早在四天以前就在农民中传开了，他们焦急地盼望着能早看到戏。周信芳先生一来，天还没有黑，望城岗周围的三十多个农业社的许多社员，以及二十里以外的一部分农民都跑来看戏，三千多人，把一个宽大的礼堂挤得水泄不通。
    这天演的是“打严嵩”和“姑嫂比剑”，两个节目都很精彩。“打严嵩”是周先生的拿手好戏之一，当他扮演的邹应龙在台上出现的时候，观众多次热烈鼓掌。这天，人虽多，但秩序非常好；天虽冷，但礼堂的气氛很热烈。大家都被周先生卓越的艺术表演吸引住了。戏演完后，有一位农民跑上台去，和周先生热烈地握手道谢，台下的观众也响起了春雷般的掌声。

　　石家庄专区评剧团到深山演出
    石家庄专区评剧团的八十多个演员，爬山涉水，于1月20日来到山区建屏县。他们到这里已经下午五点了，农民们早就盼望他们来，一看到他们，便鼓掌欢迎。一位七十多岁的李大伯说：“自打1956年和你们分手后，一直没有再见到你们，这一回你们来了，我可要狠狠看个饱。”演员们不顾疲累，当天晚上就演起戏来，礼堂里挤满了一千多观众。
    演员们为了给更多的农民演戏，将剧团分成两个班，分头到深山里演出。1月23日，三十多个演员背着行李，爬过高山峻岭，走过泥泞草地来到北冶。北冶距建屏县城三十多里，是群山环抱中的一个村子，过去这里从没有来过剧团，农民们也很少看过戏。这次，演员们露天搭起席棚当戏台，天气虽然冷，但演员演得起劲，观众也看得起劲。农民们十分满意，六十二岁的刘大伯高兴地说：“临死的人了！还有眼福看看评剧哩。往古千年谁见过城里的剧团来山沟里演戏。这真是作梦也梦不到的喜事！”　　　（建屏县计划委员会　韩秀文）
    电影上山
    江西省各县农村电影放映队，为了活跃山区文化生活，纷纷深入山区巡回放映。
    九江地区的永修县电影放映队，早在去年年底就抬着机器，沿着山上的小径，不顾崖高坡陡，翻越高山峻岭，先后在凤凰山垦荒场、向滩溪垦植场、罗神殿等四个新垦区放映了电影。这些地方，过去曾是猛兽出没的山地，原在山区居住的人们，从来没有看见过电影，这次看到电影后，高兴地说：“荒山穷岭大翻身，山坡上架起了放映机。”
    为了进一步开展山区的文化活动，江西省文化局决定在春节期间，除由各县农村电影放映队继续上山外，将在省电影发行公司、省电影器材修理供应站和省文化艺术干部学校电影放映干部训练班等三个单位中抽调干部，再组成三个电影放映队，自2月中旬起分别到井岗山、大茅山、武功山、黄岗山、障公山、云山、西山等十二个省属农、林、渔、牧综合垦植场巡回放映，使山区的群众能普遍看到新影片。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（林放）
