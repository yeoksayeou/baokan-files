I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the execution of the 1957 national budget and the 1958 national budget report, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the 1958 national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. Our meeting also made a decision, in accordance with the law, to remove and suspend the participation of the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist rightists holding important positions in state organs and among the national people's representatives. Such a serious handling is fully in line with the wishes of the people of the whole country and marks the great victory of the people's struggle against the rightists.

	The Motherland's Construction Advances Rapidly; Our Future Holds Great Promise

From the leaders' reports, we are excited to learn that our country's socialist construction is achieving brilliant successes and advancing rapidly. Before liberation, our country was a poor and backward country. Under the oppression of reactionary rule and the three major enemies, it was following the path of dying capitalism. Industrial and agricultural production declined day by day, the people's lives became more and more difficult, the strength of national defense became weaker and weaker, and the country's destiny moved deeper and deeper into the abyss of being enslaved and exploited. People of my generation have witnessed the precarious state of the country and the people living in dire straits for decades, which is truly worrying. With the Communist Party of China, based on the brilliant theories of Marxism-Leninism and the advanced experience of the Soviet revolution, combined with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, leading the people of the whole country to embark on the road of socialism, changing the social landscape, improving the people's lives, developing the national economy, and raising the country's status, great victories have been achieved on all fronts. When I visited the Northwest, Wuhan, and other places, I personally saw large-scale iron and steel plants, oil plants, thermal power plants, waterworks, tractor plants, the huge hydroelectric power projects of Liujiaxia and Sanmenxia, and the Wuhan Bridge spanning the Yangtze River, all being established one by one. Many things that could not be manufactured in the past can now be manufactured, and manufactured very well. Many things that were unimaginable in the past are now being realized quickly, better, and in considerable quantities. The news agencies of imperialist countries have also had to publish news that the European Coal and Steel Community admits that China has made the greatest progress in steel production since 1952. Both past achievements and future progress show that within fifteen years or a little more, our country will catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products. In international affairs, the new China has also occupied an extremely important position. Last July, as a representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I went to the German Democratic Republic to attend the Seventh Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany. I deeply felt the sincere and ardent friendship of the fraternal countries towards us, and because of the supreme international status of our country, we were greatly respected everywhere. We are proud to be citizens of the new China.

Our country, thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, has transformed from an old and declining country into a country with a bright future and full of youthful vitality after only eight short years, and is marching on the broad road from a backward agricultural country to an advanced industrial country. This eloquently proves the principle that taking the socialist road can lead to prosperity, while taking the capitalist road will inevitably lead to death and destruction. Since our future is so "full of hope," and we are in a new historical period of such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and a nationwide rectification movement has been launched, we should be delighted and confident, with the heroic spirit of "riding the long winds and breaking the ten thousand li waves," and "drum up our energy and strive for the upper reaches."

	Industrial and Commercialists Have Not Yet Passed the Socialist Test Well; They Should Actively Accept Transformation and Contribute to the Country's Construction

From a historical perspective, our national bourgeoisie is a patriotic class, but in the past, they only loved a country of a bourgeois democratic nature. Today, our country is already a socialist country, and capitalism has become something absolutely incompatible with the nature of our country. If we want to truly become patriots, we must abandon the reactionary capitalist standpoint, take the socialist standpoint, love the socialist motherland, resolutely follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road. It should be admitted that although we industrial and commercialists handed over the means of production in the upsurge of the three major transformations, which fundamentally changed the economic base, the vast majority of us have not yet abandoned the capitalist standpoint. We still have varying degrees of nostalgia for capitalism and varying degrees of resistance to socialism. This shows that we have not yet passed the socialist test well in terms of political standpoint and political ideology. Since last June, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country have vigorously launched a struggle against the rightists. Through participating in the comprehensive rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles, including the struggle against the rightists, most of us industrial and commercialists have been educated and tempered in the movement, identified which of the socialist and capitalist roads to take, what are the advantages and disadvantages, clarified the direction for the future, and established the confidence and determination to transform our political standpoint. As the motherland is advancing, we industrial and commercialists should, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the working class, actively accept transformation so that we can provide our talents and serve socialism wholeheartedly, and contribute our strength to the country's socialist construction together with the people of the whole country.

	Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Backbone Participates in Rectification; Great Gains from Self-Examination and Setting Personal Plans

Now, based on my personal experience, I will briefly talk about the experience of Shanghai's industrial and commercial backbone in participating in the general rectification and setting personal rectification plans. Under the correct leadership of the Party and the specific assistance at all levels, Shanghai's comprehensive rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles is being carried out in batches and centrally, and has achieved great successes. The first batch of six thousand backbone members has completed their rectification study. Through the extensive airing of views, debates, and more than 170,000 big-character posters, the students have initially learned how to distinguish between major rights and wrongs, and how to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. On the basis of achieving a decisive victory in the struggle against the rightists, they have turned to general rectification and proceeded in an orderly manner according to the steps of ideological preparation, self-examination, mutual assistance, continued airing of views, setting personal rectification plans, and writing rectification experience summaries. Self-examination and setting personal rectification plans are two relatively important parts. Self-examination is entirely based on the students' conscious willingness. Through the method of asking, answering, and debating, they deeply expose their thoughts, analyze and criticize them, so as to improve their understanding, help each other, and make progress together. The gains are great. For example, one student, who studied in the United States, used to say that the "profit" of capitalism has the effect of promoting production, and whether socialism or capitalism is better remains to be seen. Through this anti-rightist struggle and self-examination, he realized the reactionary nature of the capitalist standpoint, exposed and criticized his past erroneous views, and took the initiative to request to give up his concurrent salary. He also prepared to remit 30,000 Hong Kong dollars from abroad to the country, and prepare to catch up with the American level in three products within this year. Another student, after examination and improved understanding, said: "Before the upsurge, I loved the factory but not the home. After the upsurge, I loved the home but not the factory. Now, after rectification, I feel that I have begun to transform to love the factory first and then the home."

After self-examination, setting a good personal rectification plan is an effective way to consolidate the gains. Personal rectification plans generally include six basic contents: (1) Accept the leadership of the Party and the working class; (2) Be dutiful and responsible, and work hard; (3) Actively and proactively handle public-private relations; (4) Participate in physical labor; (5) Strengthen political theory study and improve socialist consciousness; (6) Change lifestyle. When setting personal rectification plans, some people first solicit the opinions of public representatives, and some people return to the enterprise to listen to the opinions of public representatives and employees, and revise the plan. When the content of the plan is helped by the masses, it is often assessed based on points such as "is it like" (whether it conforms to the specific situation of the person), "is it feasible" (whether it is feasible), "is it sincere" (whether it is out of sincere willingness), and "is it ruthless" (whether it has the determination to change ruthlessly), as well as whether it can be "done," "found out," and "remembered." After the plan is set, it can be continuously modified and supplemented as the individual's ideological understanding continues to improve and the specific environment changes. The implementation of each person's rectification plan can be helped and checked at any time by the leaders of the enterprise or the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce organizations. This time, the establishment of personal rectification plans is based on the fact that everyone's participation in general rectification has improved their ideological understanding. I believe that it will definitely play a major supervisory and promoting role in the self-transformation and self-education of industrial and commercialists.

	The Transformation of Class Essence is a Process of Rebirth; Rectification is to Prescribe the Right Medicine for the Sick

For us industrial and commercialists, breaking the capitalist standpoint and establishing the socialist standpoint through rectification is the transformation of class essence, a process of rebirth. A long-term illness cannot be cured all at once, and it is indeed painful and not easy to do. From the clear and strong contrast between the old and new China, we, including the industrial and commercial circles, see that the socialist system is incomparably superior. Except for a few rightists, the people of the whole country like socialism and hate capitalism. With this understanding, we can understand that only by resolutely making up our minds, actively participating in the rectification movement, and transforming our political standpoint can we adapt to our current economic status and live and work in a socialist society. If we can regard participating in the rectification to transform our political standpoint as something that we must do and is very beneficial to ourselves, we will not feel difficulties, nor will we feel more pain in the transformation. This time, our Shanghai industrial and commercialists participated in the rectification study. Through self-examination, with the help and supervision of the Party and the masses, we have set out and are constantly implementing personal rectification plans. Except for a few rightists, everyone feels like a sick person has obtained a "prescription for the right medicine," and everyone feels happy and excited. This is very beneficial to continuing to transform their own standpoint and viewpoint in the future.

General rectification in the industrial and commercial circles is a new task, and Shanghai's experience has not yet been summarized. What I have talked about above is only based on my personal superficial understanding. If there are any inappropriate places, please criticize and correct them, representatives and comrades in the industrial and commercial circles.

    抛弃反动的资本主义立场站到社会主义立场上来
    胡厥文代表谈工商业者改造立场问题
    我完全同意并衷心拥护李先念副总理的一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算报告、彭真副委员长的常务委员会工作报告、薄一波副总理的一九五八年度国民经济计划的报告和吴玉章主任关于汉语拼音方案的报告。我们这次会议并对担任国家机关重要职位的和全国人民代表中的反共、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子，依法作出了罢免和停止出席的决定，这样的严肃处理是完全符合全国人民的愿望的，标志着全国人民反右派斗争的伟大胜利。
    祖国的建设一日千里  我们的前途大有希望
    从首长们的报告里，我们兴奋地了解到我们国家的社会主义建设事业，成就辉煌，正以一日千里之势向前迈进。解放以前，我国是一个贫穷落后的国家，在反动统治和三大敌人的压迫下，走的是垂死的资本主义道路，工农业生产日益减退，人民的生活日益困苦，国防的力量日益微弱，国家的命运日益走向被奴役压榨的深渊。我们这一辈子的人，几十年来亲眼看到国家的局面风雨飘摇，人民处在水深火热之中，真是忧心如捣。有了中国共产党，根据马克思列宁主义的光辉学说和苏联革命的先进经验，结合中国革命的具体实践，领导着全国人民走上社会主义的道路，改变了社会面貌，改善了人民生活，发展了国民经济，提高了国家地位，在各个战线上都取得了伟大的胜利。我在西北、武汉等地参观的时候，亲眼看到规模宏大的钢铁厂、石油厂、热电厂、自来水厂、拖拉机厂、刘家峡和三门峡发电量巨大的水力发电工程以及横跨长江天堑的武汉大桥，都在一一的建立起来。许多过去不能制造的东西，现在能制造了，而且制造的很好，许多过去无法想像的事情，现在很快地、更好地、相当多地实现了。帝国主义国家的新闻机构，也不得不发布欧洲煤铁联营集团承认从一九五二年以来我国在产钢方面进步最大的消息。过去的成就和今后的进程都表明，在十五年或稍多一点时间内，我国在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面，将赶上或者超过英国。在国际事务中，新中国也已占着极其重要的地位。去年七月，我代表中国民主建国会去德意志民主共和国，参加德国自由民主党第七次代表大会，我就深刻地感受到兄弟国家对我们真挚炽烈的友情，和由于我国国际地位的崇高，我们到处受到极大的尊重，我们自以为是新中国的公民而感到自豪。
    我们的国家，由于有了中国共产党的正确领导，由一个古老衰败的国家，经过了短短的八年，已经成为一个前途光辉灿烂、富有青春活力的国家，正在从落后的农业国改变为先进的工业国的坦途上迈进，雄辩地证明了走社会主义道路可以日趋繁荣兴盛，走资本主义道路必然趋向死亡毁灭的道理。我们的前途既是这样“大有希望”，处在这样一个千载难逢的历史上的新时期，又兴起了全民性的整风运动，我们就应该欢欣鼓舞地、信心百倍地怀着“乘长风、破万里浪”的豪迈心情，“鼓起干劲，力争上游”。
    工商业者还没有过好社会主义关  应积极接受改造为祖国建设出力
    我们民族资产阶级从历史上看，是一个爱国的阶级，但过去所爱的只是资产阶级民主主义性质的国家。今天，我们的国家已是一个社会主义性质的国家，资本主义已经成为与我们国家的性质绝对不能相容的东西。我们要真正成为一个爱国主义者，就必须抛弃反动的资本主义的立场，站到社会主义的立场上来，热爱社会主义的祖国，坚决地跟共产党走，走社会主义道路。应该承认，我们工商业者虽然在三大改造的高潮中交出了生产资料，使经济基础发生了根本性的变化，但是，我们当中极大部分的人，基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场，对于资本主义还有不同程度的留恋，对于社会主义还有不同程度的抵触，这就说明，我们在政治立场和政治思想上还没有过好社会主义关。去年六月以来，全国人民在党的领导下，轰轰烈烈地展开了反右派的斗争，我们工商业者通过参加包括反右派斗争在内的工商界全面整风运动，大多数人在运动中受到了教育和锻炼，识别了社会主义与资本主义两条道路何去何从、孰优孰劣，明确了今后的方向，树立起改造政治立场的信心和决心。祖国在前进，我们工商业者应该在中国共产党和工人阶级的领导下，积极接受改造，才能够提供我们的才能，全心全意地为社会主义服务，才能够和全国人民一道，对国家的社会主义建设事业贡献我们的力量。
    上海工商界骨干分子参加整风  自我检查订立个人规划收获很大
    我现在根据个人的体会，简要地谈谈上海市工商界骨干分子通过参加一般整风，订立个人整改规划的经验。上海市工商界全面整风运动在党的正确领导和层层具体帮助下，正在分批集中地进行，取得了很大的成就。第一批六千骨干分子的整风学习，已经结束，曾经通过大鸣大放大辩论和数逾十七万张的大字报，使学员们初步学会了怎样明辨大是大非；怎样使用批评与自我批评的武器，在取得反右派斗争决定性胜利的基础上，转入一般整风，循序按照思想准备、自我检查、相互帮助、继续鸣放、订立个人整改规划和写整风心得体会等步骤进行自我检查和订立个人整改规划是两个比较重要的部分。自我检查完全出于学员的自觉自愿、通过问、答、辩的方式，深入地暴露思想进行分析批判，做到提高认识，相互帮助，共同进步，收获是很大的。例如有一位学员，是美国留学生，过去口口声声说资本主义的“利”有推进生产的作用，终究社会主义好还是资本主义好，还要看一看，通过这次反右斗争和自我检查，认识到资本主义立场的反动性，暴露和批判了自己过去的错误看法，并且主动要求放弃兼薪，还准备把国外的三万元港币汇到国内，准备把三种产品在今年内赶上美国水平。又有一位学员，通过检查、提高认识后，他说：“高潮前我是爱厂不爱家，高潮后是爱家不爱厂，现在经过整风，我感到已经开始转变为先爱厂后爱家了”。
    在自我检查以后，订好个人整改规划，是巩固收获的有效方法。个人整改规划一般包括六个基本内容：（1）接受党和工人阶级的领导；（2）守职尽责、努力工作；（3）积极主动搞好公私关系；（4）参加体力劳动；（5）加强政治理论学习，提高社会主义觉悟；（6）改变生活作风。订立个人整改规划的时候，有的事先征求公方代表的意见，有的回到企业以后，再来听取公方代表和职工的意见，并修订规划。规划的内容经由群众帮助的时候，常常以“像不像”（是否符合本人具体情况）、“行不行”（是否行得通）、“诚不诚”（是否出于真诚意愿）和“狠不狠”（是否具有狠狠地改的决心）以及能否“做得到”、“查得出”、“记得牢”等点，作为考核的标准。规划订立以后，可以随着本人思想认识的不断提高和具体环境的变化，不断地加以修改和补充。每个人的整改规划的执行情况，可以随时要求所在企业的领导上或民建会、工商联组织予以帮助检查。这次订立个人整改规划是建立在每个人参加一般整风提高了思想认识的基础上的，相信它一定能在工商业者的自我改造和自我教育的过程中，起着重大的督促和推动作用。
    阶级本质改造是脱胎换骨过程  整风就是对患病的人对症下药
    我们工商业者通过整风破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，这是阶级本质的改造，是一个脱胎换骨的过程，长期得来的病不是一下子可以医好的，做起来确是要有相当的时间是痛苦的，也不是很容易的。我们全国人民包括工商界在内从新旧中国的鲜明而强烈的对比中看到，社会主义制度是无比优越的，全国人民除少数右派分子外都喜欢社会主义，痛恨资本主义。有了这样的认识，我们就可以理解到，只有痛下决心，积极投入整风运动，改造我们的政治立场，才能适应我们现在所处的经济地位，在社会主义社会里生活、工作下去。我们能够把参加整风改造政治立场当作自己非做不可的、对于自己十分有益的事，就不会感觉困难，也不会在改造中感到更多的痛苦。我们上海工商业者这次参加了整风学习，通过自我检查，在党和群众的帮助和监督下，订出了并且不断地执行着个人整改规划，除少数右派分子外，大家都觉得像患病的人获得了一个“对症下药”的药方一样，都感到欣幸感奋，这对今后继续改造自己的立场观点是十分有利的。
    工商界一般整风是一项新的工作，上海市的经验也还没有总结出来，以上所谈的，仅仅本于个人的肤浅的认识，不恰当的地方，还请各位代表和工商界同志们批评指正。
