The current wage treatment for ordinary workers and general service workers in various departments and regions is generally somewhat high. Because ordinary workers and general service workers only engage in simple manual labor, and are generally recruited locally with relatively close ties to farmers, their wage treatment being excessively higher than farmers' income would arouse dissatisfaction among farmers and easily attract a large influx of farmers into cities. This would hinder agricultural production and increase difficulties in urban labor employment arrangements and residents' living supplies. In order to change this situation, it is now determined to establish the standards for the wage treatment of ordinary workers (referring to formal and temporary ordinary workers in the construction industry, as well as temporary ordinary workers in enterprises, institutions, and state organs) and general service workers (referring to service personnel, attendants, and general communication personnel in enterprises, institutions, and state organs, excluding confidential communication personnel). The People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government are responsible for formulating and implementing these standards according to the specific circumstances of each region, based on the following principles.

I. The wages of newly recruited formal and temporary ordinary workers (grades one to three) in the construction industry should not exceed the income of local farmers by too much, but the difference between urban and rural living standards should be taken into account. Therefore, their wage standards should be determined in principle to be equivalent to the income of stronger laborers in average or medium agricultural cooperatives in the main source areas of local ordinary workers, plus the difference in urban and rural living expenses. The specific standards shall be determined by the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, implemented uniformly within the province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, and reported to the Ministry of Labor for record.

The existing wage standards of formal ordinary workers and temporary ordinary workers whose contracts have not expired, who were recruited before the promulgation of these regulations, will not be changed. However, when they are promoted in the future, they should be implemented in accordance with the newly stipulated wage standards in the area.

II. The wage standards for newly recruited general service workers should, in principle, not exceed the wage standard of the twenty-eighth grade of the current wage standard table (1) for state organ staff. The specific regulations shall be formulated by the People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, implemented uniformly within the province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, and reported to the Ministry of Labor for record.

The existing wage standards of general service workers who were recruited before the promulgation of these regulations will not be changed.

III. These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    国务院关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中
    普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定
    （1957年11月16日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十五次会议原则批准）
    （1958年2月6日国务院全体会议第七十次会议修改通过）
    目前各部门、各地区的普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇，一般都有些偏高。由于普通工和勤杂工只从事简单的体力劳动，并且一般都是就地招收的，同农民的关系比较密切，他们的工资待遇比农民的收入高出过多，就会引起农民的不满，并且容易吸引农民大量流入城市，既有碍于农业生产，也给城市中劳动就业的安排和居民的生活供应等方面增加了困难。为了改变这种状况，现在确定将普通工（指建筑业中正式的和临时的普通工人以及企业、事业单位和国家机关中的临时的普通工人）和勤杂工（指企业、事业单位和国家机关中的勤务员、服务员和一般通讯员，不包括机要通讯员）的工资待遇的标准，责成各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据以下原则，按照各地具体情况，规定执行。
    一、今后新录用的建筑业中正式的和临时的普通工（一级至三级）的工资既不可超过当地一般农民的收入过多，又要照顾城乡生活水平的差别，因此，他们的工资标准，应该以相当于当地普通工主要来源地区的一般中等农业社中劳动力较强的农民的收入加上城乡生活费用的差额为原则予以规定；其他企业、事业单位和国家机关今后新录用的临时普通工的工资标准，应该大体相当于或者略低于当地建筑业普通工的工资标准。具体标准都由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会规定，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行，并且报送劳动部备案。
    在本规定发布以前已经录用的正式普通工和合同期未满的临时普通工的现行工资标准，都不予变动。但是，他们在今后升级的时候，都应该按照当地新规定的工资标准执行。
    二、今后新录用的勤杂工的工资标准，应该以最高不超过现行国家机关工作人员工资标准表（一）第二十八级的工资标准为原则，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会具体规定，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行，并且报送劳动部备案。
    在本规定发布以前已经录用的勤杂工的现行工资标准，不予变动。
    三、本规定自发布之日起施行。
