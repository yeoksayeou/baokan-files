	"Woe" Brothers
	The United States is plagued by rats, and France is no exception. Truly "woe" brothers. It is said that in France, the number of rats has exceeded the total population, with fifty million rats causing approximately $500 million in damages annually. In Paris alone, there are approximately five million rats, while only twelve people are fighting against the rat infestation (see Wenhui Daily, February 2nd).
	There are three alarming points: Firstly, the number of rats is astonishing; secondly, the losses are shockingly high; thirdly, the number of people fighting the rat infestation is shockingly low.
	In our country, the situation is completely different: the achievements in eliminating the four pests are amazingly great. Taking Beijing as an example, some street shops have already posted the eight characters "Four Pests Eliminated, Inspection Welcome." This pride, this vigor, will undoubtedly astonish our "woe" brothers.

### “难”兄“难”弟

    “难”兄“难”弟
    在美国老鼠成灾，在法国也不例外。真是“难”兄“难”弟。据说，在法国老鼠已经超过了人口的总数，五千万只老鼠，每年造成价值约五亿美元的损害。仅在巴黎大约就有老鼠五百万只，而与老鼠作斗争的只有十二个人（见2月2日文汇报）。
    这有三点惊人之处：一、老鼠多得惊人；二、损失大得惊人；三、与鼠害作斗争的少得惊人。
    而在我国情况就完全不同：除四害成绩大得惊人。试以北京为例，一些街道的铺面上，已经贴出了“四害已除，欢迎检查”八个大字。这种自豪，这种干劲，无疑会使“难”兄“难”弟大吃一惊的。
