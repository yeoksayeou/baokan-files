Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 14th: When the Erhe Dam project in Jiangsu Province began, many newly built shed stores appeared on the construction site. Although these stores were simple, the variety of goods was considerable. Rice, fuel, cooking oil, pork, candy, biscuits, canned goods, vegetables, and general merchandise were all available. The more than 20,000 migrant workers on the construction site have been able to obtain fresh vegetables from these stores every day during the eighty-plus days since construction began.

Erhe was originally a desolate place. In the past, people were afraid of the dike collapsing at Hongze Lake, so few settled here. Even those who lived here often fled to other places to make a living after disasters. Naturally, stores would not open here, and even peddlers rarely appeared. However, after the Erhe Dam project started, it became a bustling market. State-owned, supply and marketing cooperatives, and jointly owned state-private department stores, cloth shops, grocery stores, restaurants, barbershops, sewing shops, as well as Xinhua Bookstore, post office, banks and other units set up retail departments, agencies and business offices, forming a street. The employees on the construction site find it very convenient in terms of eating, using, and external contacts. At night, the small street is illuminated by electric lights as if it were daytime, and the stores are crowded with customers. The few days before the Spring Festival were especially lively, and the salespersons were overwhelmed.

    水利工地上的商店
    新华社南京14日电　在江苏省二河闸工程开工的时候，工地上就出现了许多新搭起的棚子商店。这些商店的店房虽然简陋，但商品的花色品种却不少。大米、燃料、食油、猪肉、糖果、饼干、罐头、蔬菜以及日用百货，一应俱全。工地上的二万多民工在开工以来的八十多天中，每天都能在这些商店里得到新鲜蔬菜。
    二河，原是一个荒凉的地方，过去人们害怕洪泽湖决堤，很少有定居户住在这里，即使住在这里的人，在遭灾以后也往往逃往别地谋生。商店当然不会在这里开张，就是货郎担也很少在这里出现。可是二河闸开工以后，这里就成了一片闹市。国营、供销社和公私合营的百货店、布店、杂货店、饭菜馆、理发店、缝纫店，以及新华书店、邮局、银行等单位设立的门市部、代办所和营业所，连成了一条街道，工地上的员工在吃、用和对外联系等方面都很方便。入夜，小街上电灯照耀如同白昼，商店里顾客拥挤。春节前几天这里尤其热闹，营业员们大有应接不暇之势。
