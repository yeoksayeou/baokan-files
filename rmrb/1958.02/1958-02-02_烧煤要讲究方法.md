　　Burning Coal Requires Skillful Methods
　　My family has seven people. During this cold winter season, we only use 300 jin of coal dust per month for both heating and cooking. Before winter, 250 jin per month was enough. I have visited some other families, and their coal consumption is higher than mine. This shows that there is still great potential for saving coal in households. Here, I will first introduce my coal-burning methods for my sisters' reference.
    1.  For families using coal dust, saving one or two jin of coal per day per stove is easily achievable if the coal is mixed well. The ratio of coal to soil should be appropriate. Too much soil will result in a weak fire and incomplete coal burning. Too little soil will make the coal brittle, and unburnt coal will be mixed in with the slag. The ratio of soil to coal should be approximately one to four. Frequent turning and mixing of the coal will enhance its burning power and make it less prone to crumbling.
    2.  Add coal according to the amount of heat required for the dishes being cooked. Add less coal for dishes that cook easily and more coal for dishes that take longer to cook. Avoid having excessive heat in the stove after the dishes are cooked and try to avoid adding coal midway through cooking.
    3.  Make full use of the stove's residual heat. The hot water and small amount of warm water needed in the household should generally be heated using the residual heat of the stove after cooking, avoiding starting a separate coal fire solely for boiling water. After sealing the fire in the evening, add the water needed for the next morning to the pot and place it on the stove. This will reduce heat consumption when preparing breakfast the next day.
    4.  Close the fire as soon as it is not needed, maintaining the stove fire without allowing the coal inside to burn fiercely. Mastering this method of sealing the fire allows you to add a little more coal in the evening and then start the fire the next morning without adding any coal, enough to cook a simple breakfast. Some families do not seal the fire, which may seem like the stove burns for a shorter time, but in reality, each time you start a fire, you consume several extra jin of coal, as well as some firewood.
    Adopting these methods may add some inconvenience, but in terms of saving fuel to support the great leap forward in national production, and in terms of thriftiness in managing our households, we should not find these inconveniences troublesome.
    There must be many other ways to save coal in households. I hope that female comrades who participate in housework will jointly research and experiment, and introduce more good experiences.

### 烧煤要讲究方法

　　烧煤要讲究方法
    我家有七口人。在这寒冬季节，连烤火带做饭，每月只用煤末三百斤。在冬天以前，每月有二百五十斤也就够了。我曾经访问过一些人家，他们用煤量都比我家高。这说明节约家庭用煤的潜力还很大。这里，我先把烧煤的方法介绍出来，供姐妹们参考。
    一、使用煤末的家庭，如果把煤和得好，每个火炉一天节约一、二斤煤是很容易办到的。煤和土要保持适当的比例，土多了火不旺，煤烧不透；土少了煤块易碎，煤渣里会夹带黑煤。土和煤的比例大约是一比四。和煤要勤翻多捣、拌得均匀，煤的燃烧力就强，又不容易碎。
    二、根据所做菜饭需用的热量添煤。易熟菜饭少添煤，难熟菜饭适当多添煤，不要使菜饭做好后炉内还有过多火力，也尽可能不中途添煤。
    三、充分利用火炉的余热。家庭里平时所需的开水和少量温水，一般应利用做饭后的火炉余热，尽量不要专为烧水通开煤火。晚间封火后，把明晨需用的水添在锅内，放在炉上，第二天做早饭时就可减少热的消耗量。
    四、不用火时即时将火封闭，既要保持火炉不灭，也不让炉内存煤发生炽烈燃烧。掌握好这种封火方法，晚上稍微多添进一点煤，次晨通开火不用添煤，就能做熟一顿简便早餐。有些家庭不封火，表面看来好像火炉燃烧的时间短了，实际上每升一回火要多消耗几斤煤，另外还要消耗一些木柴。
    采用以上方法会多少添些麻烦，但从节约燃料支援国家生产大跃进的重大意义来说，从勤俭持家来说，我们是不应该嫌这些麻烦的。
    节约家庭用煤的方法一定还很多，希望参加家务劳动的妇女同志们共同研究试验，多介绍一些好经验。
