Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 6th: At a civic welcome rally held at the Red Fort this evening, thousands of Delhi citizens warmly welcomed Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and shouted "Long Live Ho Chi Minh and Vietnam."

　　Amidst warm applause, President Ho Chi Minh said, "We are very pleased to see that the people of our two countries have been fighting side by side for the same ideals in the common struggle for world peace and national independence."

　　President Ho Chi Minh traced the fraternal relations between the people of India and Vietnam in their struggle for independence and praised India's achievements in national construction. He expressed gratitude to the Indian government and people for their contribution to the success of the Geneva Conference and their efforts in fulfilling their responsibilities as chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission. He said: "The most heartfelt wish of the Vietnamese people at present is to reunify their country through the free general elections stipulated in the Geneva Accords. However, due to the sabotage conspiracies of imperialists and their agents, Vietnam has not yet been unified." He said: "We firmly believe that our struggle for national reunification will be victorious." He firmly believed: "The Indian people are eager to see Vietnam reunified soon, just as the Vietnamese people are eager to see Goa return to the Indian family soon."

　　Prime Minister Nehru, speaking at the meeting, praised President Ho Chi Minh's outstanding character, calling him a "great freedom fighter" and a "source of love." He recounted the mutual connections and concern between the people of the two countries in their struggle for independence. Nehru said that the war in Vietnam ended due to the Geneva Accords, but not all problems have been resolved. India has a significant responsibility to serve on the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina. He said, "If we refuse to do so, we would be shirking our responsibility."

　　Prior to this, the chairman of the Delhi Municipal Committee, Aggarwal, presented President Ho Chi Minh with a red brocade banner and carpet woven with his congratulatory message. President Ho Chi Minh presented Aggarwal with the flag of the citizens of Hanoi.

　　When President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Nehru traveled by car through the beautifully decorated streets to the Red Fort, tens of thousands of citizens cheered and shouted slogans.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 6th: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said at a reception held for him this afternoon on the lawn of the Constitution Club here: "Striving for peace, cooperation, and friendship - this is the spring of mankind."

　　This reception was organized by Indian parliamentarians, leaders of social groups, and other prominent figures. At the meeting, President Ho Chi Minh narrated the history of the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa against foreign oppressors. He said he was very happy because the people of many Asian and African countries had achieved independence, but his happiness was not complete because in Goa in India, in Africa, and in the Americas, there were still people suffering.

　　Mrs. Ramishwari Nehru, chairperson of the Citizens' Reception Committee, was unable to attend due to illness. Her welcoming speech was read by parliamentarian Brahm Prakash. The welcome speech said: "Your arrival among us strengthens the bonds of friendship that bind India and Vietnam together." "We, the people of India, love and respect you as much as your own people." Prime Minister Nehru, who arrived during the reception, addressed the meeting with moving words, welcoming this "so outstanding" and "guest who inspires love at first sight." He said, "Humanitarianism and love for humanity are the greatest things that can generate love." Nehru praised Ho Chi Minh as a man of "great heart," saying that we feel proud to have the opportunity to welcome him.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 7th: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said on the evening of the 6th at a banquet held by Indian President Prasad to welcome him that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam supports Prime Minister Nehru's attitude in response to the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit conference.

　　Prime Minister Nehru, cabinet ministers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries attended the banquet.

　　President Ho Chi Minh also said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam opposes all military aggressive blocs and advocates universal disarmament and the prohibition of the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

　　President Prasad, on behalf of the Indian people and government, extended a warm welcome to President Ho Chi Minh, saying: "We welcome the outstanding leader of the people and the great freedom fighter."

　　President Prasad also said that India has been watching the post-war situation in Vietnam with great concern and sympathy. "We hope that the current situation will be transformed into a unified Vietnam built through peaceful means and in accordance with democratic principles."

　　印度人民敬爱胡志明主席
    德里市民盛会欢迎国宾
    胡志明和尼赫鲁强调两国友好关系
    据新华社新德里6日电　今天傍晚在红堡举行的市民欢迎大会上，成千上万的德里市民热烈地欢迎越南民主共和国主席胡志明，并且高呼“胡志明和越南万岁”。
    胡志明主席在热烈的掌声中说：“我们非常高兴地看到，我们两国人民在争取世界和平和民族独立的共同斗争中，一直并肩为同一理想而奋斗。”
    胡志明主席追溯了印度人民和越南人民在争取独立的斗争中的兄弟般的关系，并且赞扬印度在建设国家方面的成就。他表示感谢印度政府和人民对日内瓦会议的成功所作出的贡献，以及履行国际监督和监察委员会主席职责而作的努力。他说：“目前越南人民最衷心的愿望就是通过日内瓦协议所规定的自由普选重新统一他们的国家。但是由于帝国主义者和他们的代理人的破坏阴谋，越南还没有统一。”他说：“我们坚信，我们争取国家重新统一的斗争一定会取得胜利。”他坚信：“印度人民渴望看到越南早日重新统一，正像越南人民渴望看到果阿很快回到印度大家庭中去一样。”
    尼赫鲁总理在大会上讲话时，赞扬胡志明主席的出众的品德，称颂他是“伟大的自由战士”和“爱的泉源”。他追述了两国人民在争取独立的斗争中的相互联系和关怀。尼赫鲁说，越南的战争由于日内瓦协议而结束了，但是并不是所有的问题都获得了解决。印度负有重大的责任在印度支那国际监督和监察委员会中服务。他说：“我们假如拒绝这样作，就是规避责任了。”
    在这以前，德里市政委员会主席阿加瓦尔向胡志明主席献上织有他的祝辞的红色锦旗和地毡。胡志明主席把河内市民的旗帜赠送给阿加瓦尔。
    当胡志明主席和尼赫鲁总理乘汽车通过装饰得十分美丽的街道前往红堡的时候，成千成万的市民夹道欢呼，高喊口号。
    据新华社新德里6日讯　越南民主共和国主席胡志明今天下午在这里宪法俱乐部的草场上为他举行的一次招待会上说：“为和平、合作、友谊而奋斗——这是人类的春天。”
    这次招待会是由印度国会议员们、社会团体领袖和其他著名人士组织的。在会上，胡志明主席叙述了越南人民和亚非人民反对外国压迫者的斗争历史。他说：他感到很高兴，因为许多亚非国家的人民已经取得独立，但是他的高兴还不彻底，因为在印度的果阿、在非洲、在美洲，现在仍旧有人在忍受苦难。
    公民招待委员会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人因病没有出席。她的欢迎辞由议员布腊姆·普腊卡什宣读。欢迎辞说：“你来到我们中间，加强了使印度和越南结合在一起的友谊联系。”“我们印度人民就像你们自己的人民那样爱戴和尊敬你”。在招待会进行时进来的尼赫鲁总理用感人的言语在会上致词，对这位“如此出众”、“使得我们一见就生敬爱之心的客人”表示欢迎。他说：“人道主义和对人类的热爱是能产生爱的最伟大的东西。”尼赫鲁赞扬胡志明是一个“心灵伟大”的人，他说，有机会能够欢迎他使我们感到自豪。
    据新华社新德里7日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明6日晚上在印度总统普拉沙德为欢迎他而举行的宴会上说，越南民主共和国支持尼赫鲁总理响应苏联关于召开最高级会议的建议的态度。
    出席宴会的有尼赫鲁总理、内阁部长们和各国外交使节等。
    胡志明主席还说，越南民主共和国反对一切军事侵略集团，并且主张普遍裁军和禁止试验和使用原子武器和氢武器。
    普拉沙德总统代表印度人民和政府对胡志明主席表示热诚的欢迎，他说：“我们欢迎卓越的人民领袖和伟大的自由战士。”
    普拉沙德总统还说，印度一直以非常关怀和同情的心情注视着战后的越南局势。“我们希望目前的局面将会转变为通过和平方法和根据民主原则建成的统一的越南”。胡志明主席在新德里机场同印度总统普拉沙德热烈拥抱　（新华社稿）
