　　Nanchang Area Middle School Work-Study Programs Become a Trend
    Students Gain Labor Training, Reduce National Expenditure, and Solve Personal Difficulties

    (Our report) Jiangxi Daily reported: In the Nanchang Special Zone of Jiangxi Province, a work-study ethos has formed among middle school students. Zhangshu Middle School, Fengcheng Middle School, Fengcheng Junior Middle School, Wanzai Middle School, and other schools have organized work-study committees or groups to vigorously support students in part-work and part-study, enabling many students from families with financial difficulties to continue their studies, reducing national expenditure, and allowing students to receive training through labor.

    At Zhangshu Middle School, work groups and transportation groups organized by some students from families with financial difficulties perform odd jobs or transport building materials for the school, using the income earned to pay for tuition and food. During the three-day agricultural busy season holiday last year, more than 300 students from the school participated in construction site labor, donating the proceeds of over 200 yuan to the school to buy political textbooks and as donations to support water conservancy construction. More than 360 of the 500+ students at Fengcheng Junior Middle School participated in agricultural labor, completing 78,735 work points. 52 people participated in sideline production, and 87 people picked up leftover grain in the fields. The school also organized garden planting groups and laundry groups to help 32 students from families with financial difficulties solve the problem of tuition and food expenses. Some students at the school use their time after school every day, Saturdays, and Sundays to weave baskets for agricultural cooperatives, earning 10 yuan per person per month. These students' tuition and living expenses can be completely covered without relying on family support or student aid. Wanzai Middle School and Fengcheng High School also organized barber groups and repair groups, using their spare time to participate in barbering and repairing labor such as galoshes, sneakers, and washbasins. In Qingjiang County, 1,026 students from three middle schools participated in construction site infrastructure, and the income earned was enough to solve their difficulties with food and tuition fees.

    Through labor practice, not only has the economic difficulty of schooling been solved for some students, but the main gain is that they have received training in labor, and their socialist ideological consciousness has been greatly improved. According to a survey conducted by Fengcheng Junior Middle School in the first class of the second grade of the school, at the beginning of this semester, 32 of the 54 students in this class were willing to participate in agricultural production labor after graduation, which increased to 42 after a semester of work-study education and labor training. Many students have given up or reduced their people's student aid because they have labor income. Zhangshu Middle School has about 70 students who have reduced or given up their student aid. In labor practice, students have also learned labor production skills such as harvesting rice, plowing fields, planting vegetables, and weaving baskets, and have gradually developed excellent qualities of diligence and simplicity. Moreover, students who do well in work-study programs generally have better academic performance. (Liao Lingying)

　　南昌地区中学勤工俭学成风气
    得到劳动锻炼　减少国家开支　解决个人困难
    本报讯　江西日报报道：江西省南昌专区各中等学校学生勤俭求学已形成风气。樟树中学、丰城中学、丰城初级中学、万载中学等校都组织了勤工俭学委员会或小组，大力支持学生半工半读，使许多家庭经济困难的学生能够坚持读书，减少了国家的开支，并使学生从劳动中得到锻炼。
    樟树中学由一部分家庭经济困难的学生组织的勤杂组和搬运组，给学校做零工或搬运建筑材料等，把得来的报酬缴了学费、伙食费。在去年三天农忙假当中，该校学生三百多人参加工地劳动，所得二百多元献给学校买政治教材和作为支援水利建设的捐款。丰城初级中学五百多个学生中有三百六十多人参加了农业劳动，做了七万八千七百三十五个工分，有五十二人参加副业生产，还有八十七人去拣田里留下的谷穗。学校里还组织了园地种植组和洗衣组，帮助三十二个家庭经济困难的学生解决了学费膳费问题。该校有一些学生利用每天放学以后的时间、星期六以及星期天给农业社织蔑篓，每人每月能得十元的收入，这些学生的学费和生活费可以完全不依靠家庭负担和助学金补助。万载中学和丰城高中还组织了理发组、修补组，利用课余时间参加理发和修补套鞋、球鞋、脸盆等劳动。清江县有三个中等学校一千零二十六个学生参加了工地基建，所得报酬足够解决他们膳费、学杂费的困难。
    通过劳动实践，不仅解决了一部分学生求学的经济困难，更主要的收获是：他们在劳动中得到了锻炼，社会主义思想觉悟有很大提高。据丰城初级中学在该校初二第一班的调查，这学期开学初，这个班五十四个学生中愿意在毕业后参加农业生产劳动的是三十二个，通过一个学期勤工俭学的教育和劳动锻炼后，增加到四十二个。许多同学由于自己有劳动收入，都放弃或退减了人民助学金。樟树中学就有七十来个退减了助学金的。同学们在劳动实践中，也学到了割稻、犁田、种菜、编篾篓等劳动生产技能，并逐渐养成勤劳朴素的优秀品质。而且，一般勤工俭学做得好的学生，学习成绩也比较好。　（廖玲瑛）
