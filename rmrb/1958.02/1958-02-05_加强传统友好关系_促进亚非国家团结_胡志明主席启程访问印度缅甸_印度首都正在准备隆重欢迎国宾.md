Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th February: Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam departed from Hanoi by plane this afternoon for a visit to India.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh is visiting at the invitation of the Indian government. At the invitation of the Burmese government, Chairman Ho Chi Minh will visit Burma after his visit to India.

Accompanying Chairman Ho Chi Minh on his trip abroad are Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai, Minister of the Premier's Office Pham Hung, Minister of Commerce Phan Anh, Minister of Culture Hoang Minh Giam, and other accompanying personnel.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh made a brief speech at the airport, saying that his visit to India and Burma aims to further strengthen the friendship between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and India and Burma, and to promote solidarity among Asian and African countries in order to strengthen the forces defending world peace.

Among those who went to the airport to see off Chairman Ho Chi Minh were Vietnamese state leaders such as Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Le Duan, Truong Chinh, Ton Duc Thang, representatives of all ethnic groups and people from all walks of life in Vietnam, diplomatic envoys from various countries to Vietnam, and Indian expatriates, totaling more than 1,500 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th February: The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published an editorial today on Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit to India and Burma, saying that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's trip will further strengthen the relations between Vietnam and India and Burma, and make the traditional friendship between the people of Vietnam and the people of India and Burma closer.

The editorial said that Vietnam attaches great importance to its friendly unity with India and Burma and other freedom-loving, peace-loving Asian and African countries. Because this friendly unity, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, is one of the factors guaranteeing the victory of the cause of anti-colonialism and defense of peace.

The editorial said that the people of Vietnam, India, and Burma have been oppressed by colonialism in the past and have waged heroic struggles to get rid of this oppression. Now, the common goal of the people of the three countries is to complete independence, build a new life, and strive to defend peace and international cooperation. This common goal makes it easier for them to understand and support each other.
