Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd. Hubei Province is widely organizing technical guidance groups in rural areas to disseminate advanced production technologies and experiences, helping technologically backward areas catch up with the advanced.

Currently, the province-wide rice technical guidance group and cotton technical guidance group are being organized. According to preliminary determination by relevant departments in Hubei Province: The rice technical guidance group will consist of 450 rice cultivation experts drawn from Xiaogan and Huanggang prefectures, which have historically had better double-cropping rice cultivation techniques. After the Spring Festival, they will go to Xiangyang, Yichang, and Enshi prefectures, which have newly expanded rice cultivation areas, to impart advanced double-cropping rice cultivation techniques. The cotton guidance group, consisting of more than 260 cotton planting experts from Macheng, Guangji, Tianmen, Huangmei and other counties that achieved abundant cotton harvests last year, will go to Yichang and Xiaogan prefectures to guide cotton planting.

The rice and cotton guidance groups organized by Xiaogan Prefecture are also concentrating on training in Xiaogan and Hanchuan counties.

Last year, Hubei Province used the method of technical guidance groups to help 11 counties, including Xiangyang, Sui, Gucheng, Nanzhang, and Yichang, develop double-cropping rice, achieving great results. After technical guidance, these areas that trialed double-cropping rice generally achieved yields of more than 700 jin per mu, with some reaching more than 1,000 jin, and widely disseminated the experience of planting double-cropping rice. This year, after the organization of a great leap forward in agricultural production in various places, technical requirements are even more urgent. The relevant leaders in Hubei Province attach great importance to this work. At present, the counties responsible for drawing guidance personnel are carrying out serious mobilization and selection to ensure that the best technically skilled and ideologically progressive agricultural cooperative members are dispatched on schedule.

　　湖北组织技术辅导团
    到各地传授种水稻棉花经验
    新华社武汉3日电　湖北省各地农村广泛组织技术辅导团，传播先进生产技术和经验，帮助技术落后地区赶上先进。
    目前，全省水稻技术辅导团和棉花技术辅导团正在着手组织。据湖北省有关部门初步确定：水稻技术辅导团由双季稻耕作技术历来较好的孝感、黄岗两专区抽调四百五十名水稻栽培能手组成。他们将在春节后前往新扩大水稻耕地较多的襄阳、宜昌、恩施三个专区，传授先进的双季稻栽培技术。由去年获得棉花丰产的麻城、广济、天门、黄梅等县的二百六十多名植棉能手组成的棉花辅导团，将去宜昌、孝感两专区辅导植棉。
    孝感专区所组织的水稻、棉花两个辅导团，也正集中在孝感、汉川两县训练。
    湖北省去年曾采用技术辅导团的方法帮助襄阳、随县、谷城、南漳、宜昌等十一县发展双季稻，获得很大成绩。这些试种双季稻地区，经过技术辅导后，亩产稻谷一般达到七百多斤，高的达一千多斤，而且广泛地传播了种双季稻的经验。今年各地组织农业生产大跃进后，技术要求更为迫切。湖北省各有关领导十分重视这一工作。现在，负担抽调辅导员的各县正在进行认真动员、挑选，保证如期把技术最好、思想进步的农业社社员派遣出去。
