Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th -- Nanchong County has recently reorganized its spring plowing production preparation work, timely plugging the loopholes that spring plowing preparation was not keeping up with the Great Leap Forward plan.

　　The county's spring plowing production preparation work was originally arranged according to the agricultural production plan set at the end of last year. Because this plan lagged behind the actual situation, a Great Leap Forward plan was re-formulated at the beginning of this year, and the grain production increase target was raised from the original 11.5% to 45.3%, and other indicators were also increased. In this way, the original spring plowing production preparation work has been unable to adapt. For example, the multiple cropping index has changed from the originally planned 191% to 212%. In addition to expanding double-cropping rice, it is also necessary to greatly expand the area for intercropping and additional planting. However, the double-cropping early rice seeds originally prepared were still 190,000 jin short, and some intercropping and additional crop seeds had not yet been prepared. The county originally planned to buy oxen from other places, but because the sale of oxen decreased in various places during the Great Leap Forward, the county was still short of 4,000 oxen. According to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward, the county was still short of 10 billion jin of fertilizer. Because some cadres still have conservative ideas, and some have doubts about the Great Leap Forward, they either did not notice the above problems or did not pay attention to solving them in time after discovering them.

　　After the Nanchong County Party Committee discovered this, it immediately convened a meeting of district party committee secretaries and township general branch secretaries to criticize the conservative thinking of some cadres. The meeting analyzed the favorable conditions for realizing the Great Leap Forward plan and made a comprehensive inspection of various spring plowing preparation tasks. It was decided to adopt methods such as key procurement, mutual adjustment, and the development of local varieties to replace some early rice varieties, to solve the seed problem. In terms of oxen, in addition to feeding the existing oxen well and improving cultivation efficiency, mutual support and adjustment will be carried out between mountains and dams, and between townships, according to the order of cultivation. In addition, the masses will be mobilized to pull plows manually to advance the plowing of rice paddies. The county will launch multiple short-term shock fertilizer accumulation campaigns, broaden the sources of fertilizer, allocate tasks to households, and complete them on schedule. At the same time, small bone meal factories will be established in the eleven districts of the county to process and rush to produce materials locally, so that the fertilizer shortage problem can be basically solved.

### 南充县重新安排备耕工作

　　南充县重新安排备耕工作
    据新华社成都30日电　南充县最近重新安排春耕生产准备工作，及时堵塞了春耕准备赶不上大跃进计划的漏洞。
    这个县的春耕生产准备工作，原来是根据去年年底订的农业生产计划安排的。这个计划因为落后于实际，今年年初重新制订了大跃进的计划，粮食增产指标由原来的11.5％提高到45.3％，其余各项指标也都有所提高。这样，原来安排的春耕生产准备工作已不能适应，例如复种指数由原来计划的191％改变为212％，其中除扩大双季稻外，还要大量扩大增种间种面积。但原来准备的双季稻早稻种籽还差十九万斤，一部分间种和增种作物种籽还没有准备。全县原准备从外地买耕牛，因各地在大跃进中出售耕牛减少，全县尚缺耕牛四千头。按照大跃进的要求，全县肥料也还差一百亿斤。由于部分干部还存在着保守思想，有的对大跃进有所怀疑，因而他们对上述问题发现不到或发现后没有及时注意解决。
    中共南充县委发现后，立即召开区委书记和乡总支书记会议，批判了部分干部的这种保守思想。会议分析了实现大跃进计划的有利条件，对各项春耕准备工作作了全面检查。决定采取重点收购、互相调剂和发掘当地品种代替一部分早稻品种等办法，来解决种籽问题。耕牛方面，除喂好现有耕牛和提高耕作效率外，并在山地与坝地、乡与乡之间，按照耕作先后，进行互相支援调剂。此外还将发动群众用人力拉犁，提早翻耕秧田。全县将开展多次的短期突击积肥运动，广开肥源，把任务分配到户，按期完成；同时在全县十一个区开办小型骨粉制造厂，就地取材，加工赶制，这样，缺肥问题就可基本解决。
