    Open the Door to Compare, Jump Out of the Circle to Compare
    Jing Yu

    "When the door is closed, you think you're pretty good, but when you open the door, you realize you're behind." This is an experience of the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in the process of comparing advanced techniques and enthusiasm. This raises an important question: should we compare with the door closed, or should we compare with the door open?

    There are various attitudes: some people only want to close the door, look at the present, compare with the past, and feel that their company is developing step by step, which is quite gratifying. Some people advocate opening the door to compare conditionally, and the condition is that the comparison object must be exactly the same as themselves, otherwise they think it is not easy to compare. Some people hold the attitude of "better than those below, but not as good as those above." Although they open the door, they just go their own way. There is also a kind of person who opens the door and finds that their indicators are more advanced than those of their brother factories, so they become proud and complacent and do not seek to improve. All these attitudes will trap our cause in a stagnant state, and make us depressed.

    In contrast to the above attitudes, some people are never satisfied with their own level, even if their level reaches the highest national standard, they must jump out of the national scope and be determined to catch up with and even surpass the most advanced level in the world. This is the attitude of a true revolutionary. The comrades of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are like this. Some of their indicators in transportation power are very advanced compared with those of brother factories. However, they are not satisfied with this level. They jump out of the circle of the metallurgical industry system and compare with the advanced indicators of the railway transportation and power systems, and find that their most advanced indicators are still behind these enterprises. This practice of constantly seeking advanced methods can encourage oneself to always maintain a clear mind, a humble attitude, and an enterprising spirit; so that people who are prone to pride have no time to be proud, and people who may relax are not easy to relax.

    To carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, we must compete with imperialism for time and speed. If all our enterprises, like the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, open the door to compare, jump out of the circle to compare, and always move towards the most advanced goals, then our country will have great hope and will be able to catch up with the imperialist countries in the shortest time and at the fastest speed.

### 打开门来比  跳出圈外比

    打开门来比  跳出圈外比
    静宇
    “关着门看，觉得自己还不错，打开门一看，才知道自己落后了。”这是石景山钢铁厂职工在比先进、比干劲的过程中的一个体会。这里向人们提出一个重要问题：究竟应该关起门来比呢，还是敞开门来比？
    有着各种各样的态度：有的人只愿关起门来，看现在、比过去，觉得自己的企业步步发展，颇堪自慰。有的人主张有条件地打开门来比，这个条件就是所比的对象一定要跟自己一模一样，否则就认为不好比。也有人抱着“比上不足、比下有余”的态度，虽然把门打开了，却只是我行我素。还有一种人打开门来，发现自己指标比各兄弟厂都先进，于是就骄傲自负，不求上进。所有这些态度，都会使我们的事业陷在暮气沉沉的境界中，萎靡不振。
    同上述各种态度相反，有的人一时一刻也不满足于自己的水平，即使自己的水平达到了全国最高的标准，也要跳出国家的范围，决心赶上以至超过全世界最先进的水平。这是真正的革命家的态度。石景山钢铁厂的同志们就是这样。他们在运输动力方面有些指标同兄弟工厂比起来已经很先进了。但是，他们并不满足于这个水平，他们跳出冶金工业系统的圈子，去同铁路运输与电力系统的先进指标对比，发现了原来自己最先进的指标还落在这些企业的后面。这种不断寻找先进的做法，可以鞭策自己永远保持清醒的头脑、谦逊的态度和进取的精神；使容易骄傲的人来不及骄傲，可能松劲的人也不容易松劲了。
    干社会主义革命，干社会主义建设，一定要同帝国主义争时间、比速度。如果我们所有的企业都像石景山钢铁厂那样，打开门来比，跳出圈外比，永远朝着最先进的目标前进，那么，我们的国家就大有希望，就能够用最短的时间、最快的速度赶到帝国主义国家的前面去。
