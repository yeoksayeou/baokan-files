Industrial and Commercial Business Owners Must Resolve to Undergo "Complete Transformation"
    Delegate Tong Shaosheng Reports on the Anti-Rightist Struggle and Rectification Situation in Sichuan Province's Industrial and Commercial Circles

I offer the following remarks on my experiences with the comprehensive rectification movement carried out in Sichuan Province's industrial and commercial circles.

The rectification movement in Sichuan's industrial and commercial circles, focusing on countering the Rightists, breaking with the capitalist stance, and establishing a socialist stance, is being carried out comprehensively under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and local Party committees. Except for a few remote areas where extensive airing of views is still underway, most areas have entered the stage of counter-attacking the Rightists and clarifying major issues of right and wrong, while some areas have transitioned to general rectification on the basis of victory in the anti-Rightist struggle. It is estimated that the anti-Rightist struggle throughout the province can be basically concluded within the first quarter of this year. Since the launch of the rectification movement in industrial and commercial circles, I have personally participated in the joint meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Democratic National Construction Association and the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, and I have been involved in guiding the rectification movement in various cities and counties within the province. In this great movement, I, along with the majority of industrialists and merchants, have indeed received a concentrated socialist education and have deeply realized that extensive airing of views, major debates, and big-character posters are important methods for transforming the political stance of industrial and commercial circles. However, at the beginning of the movement, our understanding of rectification was still abstract. A few people had some preliminary understanding of the reactionary nature and harm of the capitalist stance, and of the division of contradictions of two different natures, but this was not deep or specific enough, while most people had a vague understanding, and some even fundamentally denied it. What aspects does the capitalist stance manifest itself in? And how to "break" it and how to "establish" the socialist stance? In the minds of most people, it was very unclear. Through extensive airing of views and major debates, we further realized the reactionary nature and harm of the capitalist stance, saw clearly the reactionary and ugly face of the Rightists, and the necessity of transforming the political stance of the intermediate elements.

　　Without Thoroughly Transforming the Political Stance, There is a Danger of Developing into a Rightist

Looking at the Rightists in the industrial and commercial circles exposed in various places, they, like the Rightists in other circles, stubbornly cling to the hostile sentiments of the bourgeoisie: they firmly oppose the leadership of the Party and the socialist system; they oppose and undermine the Five Great Movements, the Three Great Transformations, and various national policies and measures. They deny the existence of class relations and oppose continuing to accept socialist transformation. They undermine Sino-Soviet friendship and unity, slander the "leaning to one side" foreign policy, believing that it is better to "eat sugar on both sides," dreaming of seeking refuge with American imperialism. In the struggle, we also dragged out the various Rightist groups headed by Lin Quanjie, Zhong Yunhe, Li Xijiu, Luo Xiaoyuan, and Chen Yumin from the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and from Chengdu, Chongqing, Zigong, Wanxian and other places. These Rightists and Rightist groups have engaged in many sinful activities in politics and economics. The Rightist backbone elements among them were not only consistently anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist in the past, but they are still continuing to release poison and attack during the airing of views and debates, refusing to bow their heads and confess their guilt. These Rightists harbor serious ideas of changing the political climate. They hope that a Hungarian incident will occur in our country and that a third world war will break out, plotting to overthrow the leadership of the Party, realize capitalist restoration, and drag China back to the dead end of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. In the struggle, it is also clear that most of us in the industrial and commercial circles are intermediate elements who have basically not abandoned the capitalist stance. They have two sides. Although there is a side that tends to accept the leadership of the Party and accept socialism, there is also indeed another side that retains varying degrees of attachment to capitalism. They are hesitant about accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road. Many of them sympathize with and support the Rightist remarks, and some of their arguments are the same as those of the Rightists. What is more common is the feeling of "the present is not as good as the past" after the entire industry was jointly operated, and they feel unaccustomed to the socialist system. In particular, they have feelings of regret about not being able to get rich after the change of ownership, such as saying: "The Yangtze River Bridge is good, but it cannot be moved to my own home." They feel unaccustomed to and dissatisfied with the socialist collective leadership system, believing that they cannot be the masters of their own affairs, and they miss the special privileges of capitalist individual "dictatorship." On the issue of accepting the leadership of the Party, many people also admit it abstractly but oppose it specifically, separating the Party from the working class, separating the entire organic organization of the Party, admitting the leadership of the Party but not admitting the leadership of the working class, admitting the leadership of the higher-level Party organizations but not admitting the leadership of the grassroots Party organizations, especially looking down on the Party members of their own enterprises. In their hearts, they do not truly accept the leadership of the Party. On the issue of accepting socialist transformation, many people express "disgust," feeling "annoyed" when they hear the word transformation, believing that this is "a pass that never ends." To mention transformation again is to make the bourgeoisie feel inferior, and they are not convinced in their hearts about the truth of conducting essential transformation of "complete transformation." Hearing the criticism of the bourgeoisie is like having "thorns on their backs," and they are very interested in past enjoyment and corrupt lives. They feel that fixed salary income is not as convenient as it used to be to spend money, and even in abiding by public order and implementing fixed-quota distribution, they feel that it is not as good as before when they were superior because they had money. They are incompatible with the working people, and they are not convinced that the working people have turned over to be masters, and they look down on workers and peasants. Many people have a resistance to the great "Five-Anti" movement, believing that it is an unsolvable "knot" and a "unforgettable 1952." These negative and even confrontational emotions towards the leadership of the Party and the socialist road fully expose the two-sidedness and wavering of the intermediate elements, and also show that the capitalist stance of the intermediate elements has basically not been abandoned. Through the analysis and criticism of the many capitalist stances and ideas related to major issues of right and wrong that the industrial and commercial circles themselves have aired, everyone has deeply and specifically recognized the reactionary nature and harm of the capitalist stance, thus making the vast majority of people sober up and see clearly that these anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist Rightists are indeed pulling the wheel of history backward and are reactionaries moving against the tide of revolution, and that there are indeed irreconcilable antagonistic contradictions between them and the people of the whole country. If these Rightists who adhere to the capitalist stance and resolutely oppose the people are not completely defeated, it is indeed very dangerous. This requires us industrialists and merchants to draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy politically and ideologically, and actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle. And through the anti-Rightist struggle, the vast number of intermediate elements can also receive a profound socialist education. It is necessary to make the vast number of intermediate elements realize that although the reform of the capitalist ownership of the means of production was completed in 1956, the position and point of view of many industrialists and merchants have not undergone essential changes with the change of the economic base. Many people have two sides and are in a state of intermediate elements. Therefore, all industrialists and merchants with the above-mentioned situation, if they do not resolve to carry out an essential transformation of complete transformation, and do not thoroughly and completely transform their political stance, then there may be a danger of developing into a Rightist, and even the possibility of transforming from contradictions among the people into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. If this is the case, it will not only be detrimental to the socialist cause, but also very dangerous for their own future. Therefore, it is necessary to resolve to carry out in-depth essential transformation.

　　Leading Cadres Must Take the Lead in Transforming the Political Stance and Lead the Masses to Pass the Socialist Barrier Well

Adopting the methods of extensive airing of views, major debates, big-character posters to carry out the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles was not smooth sailing, but rather went through a series of complex and tortuous processes. To break the capitalist stance and establish the socialist stance is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, solving the problem of whether or not to pass the socialist barrier in the struggle between the two roads, and therefore is also a fierce self-class struggle. However, because the vast majority of people in the industrial and commercial circles have basically not completely abandoned the capitalist stance, they doubt, resist, and worry about the principles and policies of the rectification movement, especially the methods of extensive airing of views, major debates, and big-character posters, and many people have varying degrees of hypocrisy. They fear that airing of views will make them become Rightists, "lose face," and "lose their reputation." Some activists also worry that if they air their views, will the Party and the government still trust them, will they lose their prestige among the masses, and they are repeatedly and intensely engaged in ideological struggle in their hearts, hesitating. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the policies and remove ideological concerns. It should be affirmed that the capitalist stance and ideas of most of us in the industrial and commercial circles are objectively existing. Without airing of views and debate, we cannot break the capitalist stance and establish the socialist stance, and therefore we cannot resolve to take the socialist road, truly transform our political stance, pass the socialist barrier well, and transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers. But ideological concerns cannot be eliminated at once. When this problem is solved, that problem will follow. The general rule is that after basically breaking down the concerns, there is a layer-by-layer wait-and-see attitude, thinking of "seeing how the group leader and the leadership air their views." Because the leadership backbone of the industrial and commercial circles, for the most part, are intermediate elements who have basically not abandoned the capitalist stance, it is even more important to unify the thinking of our leadership in the industrial and commercial circles. We must truly recognize that the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles is the affair of the industrial and commercial circles themselves. As the leadership backbone of the industrial and commercial circles, we must not only transform our own political stance, but also lead and motivate the masses to transform their political stance and pass the socialist barrier well. To resolutely complete this arduous and glorious task, we must resolve to take the lead and do a good job in airing views. This is a key issue. Solving this problem will enable the leadership to be combined with the masses, promoting and influencing each other; and at the appropriate time, organizing large-scale airing of views, motivating the majority, and gradually guiding the airing of views to go deeper. But after the airing of views is launched, we must also prevent the idea that "the airing of views is almost done, and we can hand in the papers," and constantly check the depth and breadth of the airing of views, and constantly conduct comparisons and rankings, and overcome it, so that the extensive airing of views can be further guided to go deeper. In order to conscientiously achieve thorough airing of views, we must also, on the basis of extensive airing of views, promptly use various forms such as big-character posters and symposiums to conduct mutual exposure and mutual "gift-giving," thoroughly exposing the capitalist stance. This not only leaves the Rightists with nowhere to hide, and their reactionary faces are exposed without reservation; at the same time, it also creates favorable conditions for major debates.

　　Major Debates Educated the Intermediate Masses and Clarified Right and Wrong on Fundamental Issues

Major debates are an important stage with decisive significance in clarifying the lines between right and wrong and conducting ideological transformation. Because the problems that have been aired involve a wide range of areas, with thousands of threads and myriad details, and there are many specific practical problems, it is necessary to conduct meticulous classification and ranking of all problems according to the specific circumstances before launching the debates. Determine the order of debate problems based on the issues that everyone is most concerned about, and adopt the method of moving from the specific to the principle, from the practical to the theoretical, completely summarizing the specific problems and reactionary arguments in all aspects to the political stance, and conduct systematic and repeated debates against the various reactionary arguments of the Rightists based on the method of presenting facts and reasoning, combined with vivid and realistic examples. This not only forcefully shattered the arguments of the Rightists, achieving a hard, thorough, and stinky defeat, but also profoundly educated the intermediate masses, enabling them to draw a clear line between major issues of right and wrong on a number of fundamental issues, find the root of the capitalist stance, and clarify the direction of establishing the socialist stance. In major debates, we must adhere to believing in the majority of the masses. Although the intermediate elements have basically not abandoned the capitalist stance, have some common ground with the Rightists, and have a relatively strong tendency of leniency, they still have the positive side of tending to accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road. As long as we focus on education, constantly improve their awareness, and through the exercise of struggle, they can overcome leniency and actively participate in the debate. The experience of many places proves that as long as the awareness of the masses is improved, they can mostly criticize the Rightists with vivid and obvious facts in the form of personal experience, and the effect is good. At the beginning of the debate, due to the general level of the industrial and commercial circles, especially the industrial and commercial circles in small and medium-sized cities, the facts presented were not powerful enough and the reasoning was not sufficient enough, but this difficulty can be completely overcome. As long as the backbone elements earnestly lead the masses, collectively study, lead and help in criticizing the Rightist reactionary arguments, and appropriately organize forces through the combination of group, joint group, and general assembly debates, and conduct persuasive speeches, the masses will quickly improve, be able to draw a clear line between major issues of right and wrong, and make the major debates develop enthusiastically.

　　The Left is Consolidated and Expanded, the Intermediate Elements Turn to the Left, and the Right is Increasingly Isolated, Divided, and Disintegrated

The rectification movement in Sichuan's industrial and commercial circles has achieved great victories due to the correct leadership of the Party, the specific application of the methods of extensive airing of views, major debates, and big-character posters, and the implementation of the mass line, with emphasis on ideological work. The face of the industrial and commercial circles is already changing. The Left has been tempered and is being consolidated and expanded; the intermediate elements have been educated and are constantly transforming to the Left; and the Right is increasingly isolated, divided, and disintegrated. Many of us in the industrial and commercial circles feel relaxed and happy through the rectification, thereby realizing that this is the Chinese Communist Party continuing to implement the policy of peaceful transformation, once again saving the industrial and commercial circles, enabling the industrial and commercial circles to transform their political stance and improve their ideological awareness through the rectification, and taking another step forward on the road of advancing to socialism after the upsurge of joint operation. But we in the industrial and commercial circles must not think that the problem of transforming the political stance has been completely solved through the rectification movement and generate a sense of slackness. From the perspective of the class nature of the industrial and commercial circles, the roots of exploitation have not yet been dug up, and there is still a considerable distance between the thoughts and feelings and living habits and the workers. To carry out the essential transformation of complete transformation, we must go through arduous efforts. We should constantly strengthen learning, conduct rectification every one or two years, and展开展开 criticism and self-criticism. More importantly, in the process of self-transformation based on enterprises, we should go deep into the lower levels, actively participate in physical labor, and through labor practice, truly recognize the glory of labor, establish a labor point of view, thereby shortening the distance between ourselves and the workers in thoughts and feelings and living habits, and transforming ourselves into genuine laborers.

　　工商业者要下决心“脱胎换骨”
    童少生代表报告四川省工商界反右派斗争和整风情况
    我就四川省工商界开展全面整风运动的体会，作如下的发言。
    四川工商界以反击右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为教育内容的整风运动，在中共四川省委和各地党委领导下，业已全面展开。除边远少数地区尚在进行大鸣大放外，大部分地区已进入反击右派、辩明大是大非的阶段，部分地区则已在反右斗争胜利的基础上转入一般整风。估计全省在本年第一季度内可以基本结束反右斗争。自从工商界整风运动开展以来，我亲身参加了四川省民建会、四川省工商联召开的两会委员会联席会议，并参与了对省内各市、县整风运动的指导，在这一伟大的运动中，我和多数工商业者，确是集中受到了一次社会主义教育，并深刻体会到大鸣大放、大争辩、大字报是工商界改造政治立场的重要方法。但在运动开展之初，我们工商界对整风的认识，还只是抽象的，对资本主义立场的反动性及其危害性，对两种不同性质矛盾的划分，少数人有一些初步认识，但不够深刻和具体，而大部分人则认识模糊，有些人更根本否认。究竟资本主义立场表现在哪些方面？以及如何“破”、如何“立”？在多数人的心目中是非常不明确的。通过大鸣大放、大争，使我们进一步认识到资本主义立场的反动性及其危害性，看清了右派分子的反动丑恶面目和中间分子改造政治立场的必要性。
　　不彻底地改造政治立场  就有向右派发展的危险
    从各地暴露出来的工商界的右派分子来看，他们和其他各界右派一样，死抱着资产阶级的敌对情绪：坚决反对党的领导，反对社会主义制度；他们对五大运动、三大改造和国家各项政策措施，无不进行反对和破坏。他们否认阶级关系的存在，反对继续接受社会主义改造。他们破坏中苏友好团结，污蔑一边倒的外交政策，认为不如“两头吃糖”，梦想投靠美帝国主义。在斗争中，我们还从省工商联及成都、重庆、自贡、万县等地拖出了以林全九、锺云鹤、李锡九、罗筱元、陈裕民为首的各个右派集团。这些右派分子和右派集团在政治上、经济上作了很多的罪恶活动，他们中的右派骨干分子不仅在过去是一贯反党、反人民、反社会主义的，就是在鸣放争辩中也还在继续放毒进攻，不肯低头认罪。这些右派分子存在着严重的变天思想，他们盼望着我国发生匈牙利事件，爆发第三次世界大战，阴谋推翻党的领导，实现资本主义复辟，把中国拖回半封建、半殖民地的绝路上去。在斗争中，同时也清楚地看出我们工商界中大多数人是中间分子，基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场，他们具有两面性，虽然有倾向于接受党的领导，接受社会主义的一面，但同时也确实存在有不同程度地留恋资本主义的另一面，对接受党的领导和走社会主义道路还是三心二意的。其中有不少的人是同情和支持右派言论的，有些论点与右派还是相同的，比较带有普遍性的是在全业合营之后，存在着“今不如昔”之感，对社会主义制度感到不习惯，特别是对所有制改变之后再不能发财致富，有后悔的情绪，如说：“长江大桥虽好，不能搬到自己家里来”；对社会主义集体领导制度感到不习惯、不满意，认为不能个人当家做主，留恋资本主义个人“独断专行”的特权思想；在接受党的领导问题上，很多人也是抽象承认，具体反对，把党与工人阶级割裂开来，把党的有机组织的整体割裂开来，承认党的领导，不承认工人阶级的领导，承认上级党组织的领导，不承认基层党组织的领导，特别是对本企业职工党员瞧不起，在思想深处不是真正的接受党的领导的；在接受社会主义改造问题上，很多人表示“厌恶”，听到改造二字，就感到“泼烦”，认为这是“过不完的关”，再提改造就是资产阶级低人一等，对“脱胎换骨”地进行本质改造这一真理，内心是不服的，听到批判资产阶级的话就如“芒刺在背”，对过去享乐腐化生活，则津津乐道，深感兴趣；对固定工资收入感到不如以前用钱方便，甚至在遵守公共秩序，实行定额配销方面，也觉得不如以前因有钱而高人一等；与劳动人民格格不入，对劳动人民翻身作主不服气，看不起工人、农民；不少的人对伟大的“五反”运动存在着抵触情绪，认为是解不开的“疙瘩”，是“难忘的一九五二年”。这些对党的领导和走社会主义道路的消极甚至对抗的情绪，充分暴露了中间派的两面性和动摇性，也说明了中间派的资本主义立场基本没有抛弃。对工商界自己鸣放出来的很多有关大是大非的资本主义立场和思想，通过大争辩的分析批判后，大家都深刻而具体地认识了资本主义立场的反动性及其危害性，从而使绝大多数人头脑清醒过来，看清楚了这些反党、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子，确实是把历史车轮拉向后退，是逆革命之潮流而动的反动派，是确实同全国人民存在着不可调和的对抗性的敌我矛盾，这些坚持资本主义立场、坚决与人民为敌的右派分子，若不彻底打垮，确实是非常危险的，这就要求我们工商业者必须从政治上、思想上划清敌我界限，积极地投入反右派斗争。并通过反右派斗争，使广大中间分子也能受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，一定要使广大中间分子认识到一九五六年虽然完成了资本主义生产所有制的改革，但不少工商业者的立场观点，并没有随着经济基础的改变而获得本质的改变，不少人是存在着两面性的，处于中间分子的状态，因此凡是具有以上情况的工商业者，如果不决心进行脱胎换骨的本质的改造，不狠狠地彻底地改造自己的政治立场，那就可能有向右派发展的危险，甚至于有可能从人民内部矛盾转化为敌我矛盾。如果这样，这不但对社会主义事业不利，而对自己的前途也是非常危险的。所以这是非下决心进行深入的本质的改造不可的。
　　领导骨干要带头改造政治立场  带领群众过好社会主义这一关
    在工商界采用大鸣大放、大争、大辩、大字报的方式开展整风运动并不是一帆风顺，而是经过一系列复杂曲折过程的。破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场，就是在政治战线上、思想战线上的社会主义革命，解决在两条道路斗争中能否过好社会主义关的问题，因而也就是一场激烈的自我阶级斗争，但由于工商界绝大多数人基本上还没有彻底抛弃资本主义立场，对于整风运动的方针、政策，特别是大鸣、大放、大争、大辩、大字报的方式，怀疑抵触，顾虑重重，不少的人均在不同程度上存在着虚伪应付的现象。怕鸣放了当右派，“丢面子”，“下招牌”，有些积极分子也顾虑鸣放出来，党和政府会不会还信任他，在群众中会不会失掉威信，内心里都在反复地、剧烈地进行着思想斗争，徘徊不定。因此，必须反复地交代政策，解除思想顾虑。应当肯定我们工商界中多数人的资本主义立场和思想是客观存在的，不鸣不争，就不能破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，因而也就不能下定走社会主义道路的决心，真正改造政治立场，过好社会主义这一关，把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。但思想顾虑并不是一下可以解除的，这个问题解决了，那个问题就会接着又来。一般的规律，是在基本上打破顾虑之后，就出现了层层观望，“看组长，看领导如何鸣放”的思想。由于工商界整风领导骨干一层，多数是基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场的中间分子，因此，更重要的是统一我们工商界领导层的思想，要确实认识工商界整风运动是工商界自己的事情，作为工商界的领导骨干，不仅要改造自己的政治立场，而且还必须领导和带动群众改造政治立场，过好社会主义关。要坚决完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务，就必须下定决心，带头下水，搞好鸣放。这是一个关键问题，这个问题解决了，就能够使领导与群众结合在一起，相互推动，相互影响；并在适当时期，组织大会鸣放，带动多数，把鸣放逐步导向深入。但在鸣放开展起来之后，还必须防止认为“鸣放已经差不多了，可以交卷了”的思想，要不断地检查鸣放的深度和广度，不断地进行评比和排队，加以克服，使大鸣大放进一步导向深入。为了认真作到鸣深放透，还必须在大鸣大放的基础上，及时运用大字报和座谈会等各种形式，进行彼此揭露，互相“送礼”，彻底暴露资本主义立场，这就不仅使右派分子无藏身之处，反动面目暴露无遗；同时，也为大争大辩创造了有利条件。
　　大争大辩教育了中间群众  在根本问题上辨明是非
    大争大辩是划清是非界限，进行思想改造的具有决定意义的重要阶段。由于鸣放出来的问题涉及面广，千头万绪，并有许多具体实际问题，因此，在开展争辩之前，必须把所有问题，根据具体情况，进行细致的分类排队工作。根据大家最关心的问题，确定争辩问题的次序，并采用由具体到原则，从实际到理论，把各个方面的具体问题和反动论点完全归纳到政治立场上来，根据摆事实，讲道理的方法，结合现实生动的事例，针对右派各种反动论点进行系统地反复地辩论。这就不仅有力地击破了右派的论点，做到了打狠、打透、打臭，而且也深刻的教育了中间群众，使之对若干带根本性的问题能够划清大是大非的界限。找到资本主义立场的根子，明确立社会主义立场的方向。在大争大辩中要坚持相信群众的多数，虽然中间派基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场，与右派有某些相通之处，温情主义比较浓厚，但他们仍还有倾向于接受党的领导和走社会主义道路的积极的一面，只要抓紧教育，不断提高觉悟，通过斗争的锻炼，是能够克服温情主义积极参加争辩的。不少地方的经验证明，只要群众觉悟提高以后，多能以现身说法的方式，生动明显的事实批判右派，效果都是良好的。在辩论之初，由于工商界、特别是中小城市的工商界一般水平不高，曾经有过摆事实不够有力，说道理不够充分的情况，但这种困难是完全可以克服的，只要骨干分子认真带动群众，在批判右派反动论点中，集体研究、领导帮助，并通过小组、联组和大会辩论相结合的方式适当组织力量，进行有说服力的发言，群众就会迅速提高，能够划清大是大非的界限，使大争大辩热烈的开展起来。
　　左派巩固扩大　中间派向左转  右派日趋孤立、分化和瓦解
    四川工商界整风运动，由于党的正确领导，具体运用了大鸣大放、大争辩、大字报的方法，并贯彻了群众路线，注重了思想工作，因而取得很大的胜利。工商界的面貌已经在起变化，左派受到了锻炼，正在巩固和扩大；中间派受到教育，不断向左转化；右派日趋孤立、分化和瓦解。我们工商界很多人通过整风都感到轻松愉快，从而体会到这是中国共产党继续贯彻和平改造方针，再一次挽救了工商界，使工商界通过整风，改造政治立场，提高思想觉悟，继合营高潮之后向社会主义前进的道路上又跨进了一步。但我们工商界决不能认为通过整风运动，改造政治立场的问题就已完全解决，产生松劲思想。从工商界的阶级本质来说，剥削根子尚未挖掉，思想感情、生活习惯与工人之间尚有不小的距离，要进行脱胎换骨的本质改造，还必须经过艰苦的努力。应不断地加强学习，每隔一、二年进行一次整风，展开批评和自我批评，更重要的是以企业为基地进行自我改造过程中，深入下层，积极参加体力劳动，通过劳动实践，真正认识劳动光荣，树立劳动观点，从而在思想感情、生活习惯上缩短与工人之间的距离，把自己改造成为名副其实的劳动者。
