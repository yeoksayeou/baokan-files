Following the opening of the posthumous works exhibition of China's great artist Qi Baishi in the capital, it has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. Up to today, more than 80,000 people have visited. People not only gain artistic appreciation from it, but also are deeply inspired and encouraged by the spirit of this outstanding art master who lived to old age, learned to old age, worked to old age, and worked diligently throughout his life.

In order to further learn from this art master in a better way, the Chinese Artists Association has held three symposia. Nearly a hundred people attended, including famous artists in the capital and heads of various branch associations from other places who came to Beijing for meetings, such as Yu Feian, Qin Zhongwen, Fu Baoshi, Li Keran, Ye Qianyu, Jiang Zhaohe, Wu Zuoren, Cai Ruohong, Wang Chaowen, Hua Tianyou, and Huang Xinbo. Whether they were Chinese painting artists, printmakers, oil painters, sculptors, or cartoonists, they all unanimously agreed that the reason why Qi Baishi's art can so deeply touch people's hearts, and why the vigorous, optimistic, and upward spirit in his works is so closely related to the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of the people, is inseparable from his birth among the working people and his consistent maintenance of the simple, kind, and pure qualities of the working people. In the old society, he never compromised with the ugly and brutal rulers and national enemies, and adhered to noble national integrity; he did not cater to the corrupt atmosphere of the old society, never stained himself with the bad habits of the decadent class's literati and maintained the true color of the working people. He enthusiastically praised the great rivers and mountains of the motherland; he also entrusted his attachment and praise for working life to the rakes, hoes, chickens, and oxen he used to raise in his youth. These works all expressed the simple, healthy, and full life desires and indomitable will of the working people. He gave implicit but unforgiving satire to the darkness of the old society.

The artists' experience in learning from Qi Baishi is that they see each other's strengths. One common point is that they see from the works, quotations, drafts, and poems of Bai Shi's life at various periods: the correct path he explored in long-term and arduous artistic labor. He advocated "to have something seen in the chest first, then the pen will be divine." "The beauty lies in the likeness and unlikeness." He was both faithful to objective reality and mastered the characteristics of art; he was neither rigid in superficial resemblance nor violated the truth; he opposed both naturalism and formalism, so as to achieve the highest state of both form and spirit. He once went all out to painstakingly learn the essence of the artistic heritage of his predecessors, but he also demanded to get rid of the old conventions of his predecessors and achieve innovation through high creativity. Some old Chinese painters also combined this point to criticize their own conservative thinking, and proposed that they should learn from Qi Baishi's attitude of inheriting and carrying forward the heritage. Qi Baishi's works use both skill and clumsiness, and his brushwork and ink are extremely high, which is even more surprising that his painting, poetry, calligraphy and seal cutting show each other's ingenuity and achieve a perfect combination. His artistic practice has solved many contradictions that past painters have not solved, such as: the unification of classical art and folk art, achieving both elegance and popularity, returning art that was previously separated from the people to the people; the unification of excellent skills and rich content, etc., showing the development prospects of Chinese painting art, and providing a reference experience for the construction of a new socialist national culture. The artists also believe that Qi Baishi's artistic contribution needs to be valued more highly, and it is recommended to establish a special research institution.

    学习现实主义大师齐白石的艺术
    首都美术家展开热烈的讨论研究
    本报讯　我国伟大艺术家齐白石的遗作展览会在首都开幕后，受到了各界人士的热烈欢迎。到今天为止前往参观者已有八万余人。人们不仅从中得到艺术欣赏的一种满足，而且从这位杰出的艺术大师活到老、学到老、做到老，一生刻苦勤劳的干劲，也深深受到启发和鼓舞。
    为了进一步更好地向这位艺术大师学习，中国美术家协会已经召开了三次座谈会，出席的有首都著名美术家和各地来京开会的各分会负责人于非暗、秦仲文、傅抱石、李可染、叶浅予、蒋兆和、吴作人、蔡若虹、王朝闻、滑田友、黄新波等近百人。不论中国画画家、版画家、油画家、雕塑家或漫画家，都一致认为：齐白石的艺术所以能这样深深扣动人的心弦、作品中那种蓬蓬勃勃乐观向上的情绪与广大人民思想感情息息相关，是和他出身于劳动人民，始终保持了朴实、善良、纯正的劳动人民品质分不开的。在旧社会，他从没有向丑恶凶暴的统治者和民族敌人妥协，坚持了高尚的民族气节；他不迎合腐败的旧社会风气，从不沾染没落阶级的文人墨客的恶习而保持了劳动人民本色。他满腔热情地歌颂祖国的大好山河；也把自己对劳动生活的依恋和赞美寄托于少年时曾用过的耙子、锄和喂养的鸡群与耕牛等。这些作品都抒发了劳动人民朴质、健康、饱满的生活欲望和不屈的意志。对旧社会黑暗，他给以既含蓄又不容情的讽刺。
    美术家们向齐白石学习的心得，是互见所长的，其中有一个共同点，是从白石老人生平各个时期的作品、语录、画稿和诗草中看出：他在长年累月的辛勤刻苦的艺术劳动中，所探索出的正确道路。他主张“要胸中先有所见之物，然后下笔有神。”“妙在似与不似之间”。既忠实于客观现实，又掌握住艺术的特性；不拘泥于表面的形似，也不违背真实；反对自然主义也反对形式主义，从而达到形神兼备的最高境界。他曾全力以赴地刻苦学习前人的艺术遗产中的精华，但又要求脱尽前人窠臼，以高度的创造精神达到推陈出新。有的老国画家还结合这点批判了自己的保守思想，提出应该学习齐白石对待遗产既继承又发扬的态度。齐白石的作品巧拙并用，笔情墨趣极高，更令人惊服他的画、诗、书法和篆刻四者互见匠心，达到了完美的结合。他的艺术实践解决了过去的画家未曾解决的很多矛盾，如：古典艺术和民间艺术得到统一，达到雅俗共赏，把以前脱离人民的艺术交还于人民；卓越的技巧和丰富的内容统一等，展示了中国画艺术的发展前途，为建设社会主义的民族新文化提供了借鉴的经验。美术家们还认为：对齐白石的艺术贡献，需要有更高的估价，建议成立专门研究机构。
