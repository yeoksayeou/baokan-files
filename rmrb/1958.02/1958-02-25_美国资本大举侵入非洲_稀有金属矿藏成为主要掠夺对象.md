Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Berlin Dispatch: The "Neues Deutschland" newspaper recently published an article exposing the large-scale invasion of Africa by U.S. capital.

The article pointed out that although U.S. capital had already invaded Africa and controlled certain economic sectors before and during World War II, Africa has become even more significant to U.S. monopoly capital as a source of profit, a supplier of cheap raw materials, and a strategic stronghold, due to the loss of many strategic strongholds and raw material bases in Asia after the war. Currently, the total investment of U.S. monopoly groups in Africa has reached two billion U.S. dollars. They extract staggering profits from the labor of the African people every year.

The article cited several examples of the active expansion of U.S. capital in Africa. The Republic of Liberia in West Africa is the starting point for U.S. capital's expansion into Africa. From 1950 to 1956, U.S. investment in this country increased from 82 million U.S. dollars to 250 million U.S. dollars, more than tripling. The gold, platinum, diamonds, manganese, timber, and cocoa deposits and resources there are the main targets of plunder by U.S. monopoly capital.

In North Africa, U.S. capital first entered the three sectors of non-ferrous metals, petroleum, and uranium mining. It also has a strong desire for the mining of iron sand, borax, manganese sand, and diamonds in French West Africa and Equatorial Africa.

The Belgian Congo occupies a priority position in the plan of U.S. capital's expansion into Africa, because the uranium ore produced here ranks first in the capitalist world, cobalt ore accounts for three-quarters of the total output of the capitalist world, copper accounts for 7.5%, and zinc accounts for 9%. In addition, it also produces large amounts of manganese, gold, and diamonds. Diamond production accounts for more than half of the world's output. The intervention of U.S. capital in the Belgian Congo has already threatened the power of British capital here.

U.S. capital is also extremely active in the Union of South Africa. At present, at least 160 U.S. companies belonging to the Morgan, DuPont, Mellon, Rockefeller and other consortia are operating here. From 1942 to 1956, U.S. private investment in the Union of South Africa alone increased from 86 million U.S. dollars to 275 million U.S. dollars. U.S. "General Motors" and "Ford Motor Company" recently opened assembly plants here.

In addition, U.S. capital has also extended to Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Portuguese Angola. Since 1952, the total amount of "loans" from the United States to Ethiopia has reached 100 million U.S. dollars.

The article pointed out that as U.S. capital massively invades the spheres of influence of Britain and France in Africa, the contradictions between these imperialist countries are becoming increasingly acute. In order to resist the invasion of U.S. capital into North Africa, French monopoly groups are sparing no effort to absorb British investment to strengthen their own power; while the United States is uniting with West German monopoly capital in an attempt to further expand its power in Africa.

    美国资本大举侵入非洲
    稀有金属矿藏成为主要掠夺对象
    新华社24日讯　柏林消息：“新德意志”报最近刊登了一篇文章，揭露美国资本大举侵入非洲的情况。
    文章指出，虽然早在第二次大战以前和战时，美国资本就已经侵入非洲并控制了非洲的若干经济部门，但是由于战后美国在亚洲失去了不少战略据点和原料基地，因此，非洲作为利润源泉、廉价原料供应地和战略据点，对于美国垄断资本来说更有了巨大的意义。目前美国垄断集团在非洲各地的投资总额已经达到二十亿美元。它们每年从非洲人民的劳动中榨取惊人的利润。
    文章举出了美国资本积极在非洲进行扩张的若干实例。西非的利比利亚共和国是美国资本向非洲扩张的起点。从1950年到1956年，美国对这个国家的投资从八千二百万美元增加到二亿五千万美元，即增加了两倍多。那里的黄金、铂、钻石、锰、木材和可可等矿藏和富源是美国垄断资本掠夺的主要对象。
    在北非，美国资本首先是打入有色金属、石油和铀矿开采等三个部门。它对法属西非和赤道非洲境内的铁砂、硼砂、锰砂和钻石开采也有强烈的欲求。
    比属刚果在美国资本向非洲扩张的计划中占据着优先地位，因为这里出产的铀砂在资本主义世界居第一位，钴砂占资本主义世界全部产量的四分之三、铜占7.5％、锌占9％。另外，这里还出产大量的锰、黄金和钻石。钻石产量占世界产量的一半以上。美国资本对比属刚果的插手已经威胁到英国资本在这里的势力。
    美国资本在南非联邦也极其活跃。目前至少有分属摩根、杜邦、梅隆、洛克菲勒等财团的一百六十家美国公司在这里活动。从1942年到1956年，仅美国对南非联邦的私人投资额就从八千六百万美元增加到了二亿七千五百万美元。美国“通用汽车公司”和“福特汽车公司”不久前都在这里开设了装配厂。
    此外，美国资本也伸入了南北罗得西亚和葡属安哥拉等地。从1952年以来，美国对埃塞俄比亚的“贷款”总额已经达到一亿美元。
    文章指出，随着美国资本大举侵入英、法在非洲的势力范围，这些帝国主义国家间的矛盾正日趋尖锐化。法国垄断集团为了抵制美国资本入侵北非，正在不惜吸收英国的投资来壮自己的声势；而美国则正在联合西德垄断资本，企图更进一步扩大它在非洲的势力。
