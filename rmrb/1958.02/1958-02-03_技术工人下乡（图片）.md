　　Skilled Workers Go to the Countryside
    To support the great leap forward in agricultural production, over 900 outstanding skilled workers from 51 state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province have gone to the countryside to help farmers repair agricultural power machinery and tools. They will ensure that all of the province's existing 3,930 power machinery are up and running before the spring plowing, to irrigate in times of drought and drain in times of flood, striving to achieve a brilliant victory in grain and cotton production in 1958.

　　技术工人下乡
    山西省五十一个国营厂矿的九百多名优秀技术工人，为了支援农业生产大跃进，已经下乡帮助农民检修农业动力机械和农具。他们要保证全省现有的三千九百三十台动力机械在春耕前全部开动起来，遇旱浇地，遇涝排水，争取在1958年粮棉产量上打一个漂亮仗。
