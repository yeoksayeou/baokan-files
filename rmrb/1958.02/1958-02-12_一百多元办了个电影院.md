From various newspapers:

    A Movie Theater Built for a Little Over One Hundred Yuan
    On February 7th, the Liaoning Daily prominently featured on the front page of its second edition a report about the Lingqian District of Dalian City building a movie theater for 137 yuan, along with a short commentary titled "Running Cultural Undertakings Thriftily."
    The theater's venue was a dormitory on the second floor of the Lingqian Market, costing nothing; the projector was shared with the Cultural Bureau's film team, also costing nothing; the curtains were borrowed used ones from a sister cinema, again costing nothing; even the screen was hand-painted on a white wall. The one hundred plus yuan was spent on buying wood (to build seats), buying electrical wiring, etc.
    This movie theater can accommodate 300 people. Although the equipment is simple, the ticket prices are low, and more importantly, it is convenient for the masses. Since its opening on New Year's Day this year, it has attracted hundreds of viewers every day.

    一百多元办了个电影院
    7日辽宁日报以二版头条地位，报道大连市岭前区用一百三十七元钱办了一个电影院，并且发表了题为“勤俭办文化事业”的短评。
    这个影院的场地是利用岭前市场二楼一间宿舍，不花钱；电影机是与文化局电影队合用的，也不花钱；窗帘是向兄弟影院借来旧的，也不花钱；甚至银幕也是用双手在白墙上画的。一百多元钱就用在买木板（搭座位）、买电线等上面。
    这个电影院可容三百人，设备虽然简陋，但是票价低，更重要的是群众称便，今年元旦开幕以来，每天都吸引了上百的观众。
