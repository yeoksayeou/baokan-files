    Leadership Methods Should Also Take a Great Leap Forward
    Yi Huai
    "Shanghai's Thursdays" have brought us good news and confidence: in the high tide of the all-round Great Leap Forward, the work methods and work style of leading cadres will also undergo a Great Leap Forward, and the situation of leadership lagging behind the masses will definitely be quickly improved.
    Leaders neither directly produce grain nor personally manufacture machines. The leap forward for leaders lies in whether they can eliminate bureaucratism, inertia, and arrogance, improve leadership methods, and go among the masses to lead them in a leap forward.
    The Secretary of the Yulin District Committee of Shanghai and the Director of the Transportation Bureau are doing just that. They go deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, and promptly discover, summarize, and disseminate the good experiences and good methods of grassroots units; they bring the leadership's intentions for production and work to the lower levels, consult with the workers, and solicit their opinions. Any good experience or good method is created by the masses, not concocted by leaders sitting in their offices. Only by frequently going among the masses can one come into contact with all kinds of new things, making leaders sharp-eyed and clear-eared, and making leadership work more effective.
    Is there any difficulty in going among the masses? We can't say there isn't. Two months ago, Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, severely criticized the bureaucratic style of leading cadres being divorced from the masses in his report to the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress: some leaders can only be seen by the masses in newspapers; some leaders are not at all warm when they see the masses, "with both hands in their pockets, not even smiling"; some people are full of bureaucratic airs, bossy, making the masses feel intimidated; some people only know how to hold meetings and write official documents all day long, and rarely move among the masses.... This situation is by no means unique to Shanghai. In some places, it is difficult for the masses to meet with leaders and talk to them even when they come to the door. Even on ordinary days, this style is often criticized and condemned. However, for many comrades, criticism is just criticism, and improvement is not great. They always feel that it is not that they are unwilling to leave the office, but that there are many stumbling blocks that make it impossible for them to frequently go among the masses.
    Stumbling blocks exist, but there are ways to kick them away. Since some leading comrades in Shanghai and other places can do this, others can certainly do it as well. In fact, whether it can be done or not depends on whether there is determination. The stumbling block is first and foremost within oneself, and that is bureaucratism. However, for Communists and non-Party revolutionary cadres, changing it is not too difficult. Taking one's hands out of one's pockets, being more warm when meeting the masses, and making the masses feel the equal and close relationship between them and the leaders is precisely the true color of revolutionaries. As long as there is sufficient determination, we can restore our original appearance. Stumbling blocks also exist in many of our work systems. However, the system is set by us, and we can set it and change it; the system is for our service, it is our tool, and we must not be enslaved and bound by it, becoming its tool. Many leading comrades who have already left the office have first broken free from the shackles of these conventions!

### 领导方法也要来个大跃进

    领导方法也要来个大跃进
    易槐
    “上海市的星期四”给我们带来了喜讯和信心：在全面大跃进的高潮中，领导干部的工作方法和工作作风也将来一个大跃进，领导落后于群众的状况一定能够很快地有所改进。
    领导者既不直接生产粮食，也不亲自制造机器。领导者的跃进就在于能不能打掉官气、暮气、骄气，改进领导方法，到群众中去领导群众跃进。
    上海市榆林区委书记和交通局局长就是这样做的，他们深入到基层，深入到群众中去，及时地发现、总结、传播基层单位的好经验、好办法；把领导上对生产和工作的意图带到下边去，和工人们商量，征求工人们的意见。任何好经验、好办法都是由群众创造出来的，而不是领导者坐在办公室里杜撰的。只有经常到群众中去，才能接触到各种新鲜事物，使领导者变得耳聪目明，领导工作更富有成效。
    到群众中去，有没有困难呢？不能说没有。两个月前上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志在上海市党代表大会上的报告中曾严厉地批评了领导干部脱离群众的官风：有些领导者，群众只有在报纸上才能看到他们；有些领导者见了群众一点也不亲热，“两手插在口袋里，笑也不笑一下”；有些人官气十足，盛气凌人，使群众望而生畏；有些人一天到晚只会开会办公文，很少在群众中间活动……。这情形决不是上海所特有的。有些地方，群众找上门来，也很难和领导者见上一面，谈上几句话。就是在平日，这种作风也是常常受到批评和责难的。可是，对于不少同志来说，批评尽管批评，改进却是不大。他们总觉得不是自己不愿走出办公室，而是绊脚石很多，使得他们无法经常到群众中去。
    绊脚石是有，但是，有办法踢开。既然上海市以及其他地方的一些领导同志能够这样做，其他的人当然也能这样做。其实，做不做得到，关键就在于有没有决心。绊脚石首先就在自己身上，那就是官气。可是，对于共产党人和非党的革命干部来说，改掉它，并不是太困难的事情。把手从口袋里拿出来，见了群众亲热一些，使群众感到他和领导者之间的平等的亲切的关系，这正是革命者的本色，只要有足够的决心，就可以还我本来面目。绊脚石还存在于我们的很多工作制度之中。可是，制度是我们定下的，我们可以定它，也可以改变它；制度是为我们服务的，它是我们的工具，我们决不能受它们的奴役和束缚，成为它们的工具。许多已经走出办公室的领导同志就都是首先摆脱了这些常规的束缚的！
