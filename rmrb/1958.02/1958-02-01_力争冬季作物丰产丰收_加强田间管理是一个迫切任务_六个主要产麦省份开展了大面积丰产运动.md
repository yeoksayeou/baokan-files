Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch, January 31st: Xinhua News Agency agricultural reporter reports: Strengthening field management of winter crops and striving for a bumper harvest has become an urgent task for all agricultural cooperatives planting these crops.

　　Currently, winter crops are growing well in most parts of the country. In the fields of the southern regions, it is already a lush green, with wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, green manure, and other crops growing vigorously and pleasingly, with plant growth in some areas surpassing previous years. In the northern regions, most wheat fields have received good winter irrigation and topdressing, and wheat seedlings are growing more vigorously than in previous years; winter wheat in some areas, which grew poorly due to late sowing caused by autumn drought, has also improved before the ground froze. However, some areas are currently neglecting the management of winter crops due to being busy with water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, or poor labor allocation. This situation needs to be changed quickly.

　　This reporter understands that due to the autumn drought in the northern provinces last year, although the planting area of wheat in the southern provinces has increased compared to previous years, the national winter wheat planting area is still more than 8 million mu less than in 1956. To strive for increased wheat production this year, the main reliance is on increasing the yield per mu; therefore, strengthening winter field management of wheat fields is the key to increasing production. In addition, the sowing of wheat in the north was relatively late due to the autumn drought, and the late replanting in the south was also relatively late, which requires strengthening irrigation, topdressing, field management, and other measures to make up for it.

　　Although the winter wheat planting area has decreased compared to the past, the total planting area of all winter crops has slightly increased compared to last year. Among them, the rapeseed planting area reached more than 36 million mu, an increase of more than 2 million mu compared to last year. Green manure crops, which are one of the main sources of fertilizer in the southern rice-growing areas, have increased in planting area by about 10 million mu compared to last year. As long as farmers in various regions can earnestly strengthen field management and prevent various possible disasters, the total output of various winter crops this year, including winter wheat, may still increase compared to previous years.

　　It is understood that in the high tide of winter production, the field management of winter crops has been done well in most areas. According to incomplete statistics before the ground froze, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, and other six provinces have already irrigated more than 42 million mu of wheat. For example, the irrigated wheat area in Shandong Province has increased six times compared to the same period last year. The southern provinces have also paid attention to ditching, draining, and frost prevention in wheat fields. Most areas of the country have also carried out field management work such as weeding, topdressing, and frost prevention for rapeseed.

　　However, unfavorable factors such as poorly growing winter crops and excessive plant growth requiring the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests still exist, so management must be strengthened. According to local experience, establishing specialized agencies, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for field management, and combining the rural rectification movement with winter production are all effective ways to promote the field management of winter crops. At present, attention should be paid to making full use of the water conservancy projects that have been extensively built and the fertilizers that have been accumulated in large quantities in winter, to expand the area of spring irrigation and topdressing as much as possible, and to do a good job in spring management such as hoeing and raking to conserve moisture and preventing frost damage (and in the south, doing a good job in ditching and drainage).

Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch, January 31st: Farmers in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Anhui provinces, whose wheat production and planting area account for about 60% of the country, are launching a large-scale bumper harvest movement for wheat, striving to achieve a great leap forward in wheat production this year.

　　Last winter, when wheat was sown, these provinces suffered from a drought that was rare in decades. Although local farmers tenaciously carried out drought resistance and rushed to plant, the winter wheat planting area was still more than 5 million mu less than in 1956, and relatively serious seedling shortages and broken ridges occurred in some areas of wheat fields. Therefore, in addition to strengthening wheat field management, farmers in these six provinces have generally adopted measures to cultivate high-yield wheat fields to increase production, striving for a yield of two mu of wheat from one mu. According to incomplete statistics, the six provinces have established a total of more than 86 million mu of high-yield wheat fields, equivalent to 35% of the winter wheat planting area of the six provinces and close to one-quarter of the national winter wheat planting area. The planned average yield per mu of these high-yield fields is more than 200 jin, generally about twice as high as the average yield per mu of the provinces in 1957. After these high-yield plans are realized, these six provinces will be equivalent to planting more than 80 million mu of winter wheat more than last year. This will not only make up for the reduction in planting area last winter (the country reduced by more than 8 million mu) and the possible reduction in production caused by seedling shortages in some areas of wheat fields, but also increase the total wheat production this year compared to last year.

　　Since entering winter, while extensively building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer, farmers in these six provinces have generally carried out wheat field management centered on watering and topdressing. Farmers in many areas have also promoted the "five waterings and three fertilizations" movement created in Henan Province. For example, parts or almost all of the 20 million mu of high-yield wheat fields in Shandong Province and 14 million mu of high-yield fields in Hebei Province have been topdressed, and before the ground froze, most or all of these wheat fields were watered once, twice, or even three times. After the ground froze, farmers in various regions braved the severe cold to move snow and ice to the wheat fields and carry out activities such as compaction to conserve moisture. The management of general wheat fields has also been greatly strengthened. Of the more than 70 million mu of winter wheat in Henan Province, more than 50 million mu have been fertilized once or twice. Farmers in the Guanzhong and Hanzhong areas of Shaanxi Province have topdressed 80% to 90% of their wheat fields, and the general fertilized area is about 20% more than in the same period last year.

　　Due to a series of work, wheat seedlings are currently growing vigorously in most areas of these six provinces. The wheat seedlings in Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces have deep roots and many tillers this year, which is rare in previous years.

　　力争冬季作物丰产丰收
    加强田间管理是一个迫切任务
    六个主要产麦省份开展了大面积丰产运动
    本报特约新华社31日讯　新华社农业记者报道：加强冬季作物的田间管理、力争丰产丰收，已经成为一切种植这些作物的农业社的迫切任务。
    目前全国大部分地区冬季作物生长良好。南方地区的田野里，已是一片葱绿，小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆、绿肥等作物长得茁壮，引人喜爱，有些地区的植物生长情况胜过往年。北方地区，大部分麦田由于得到了良好的冬灌和追肥，麦苗也长得比往年旺盛；部分地区因秋旱迟播，生长较差的冬小麦，封冻前也有好转。但是目前有一些地区因忙于修水利、积肥，或者因对劳力安排的不好，放松了对冬季作物的管理。这种情况需要迅速改变。
    本社记者了解：由于北方各省去年秋旱，虽然南方各省种麦面积比往年有所增加，但全国冬小麦播种面积比1956年仍少八百多万亩。争取今年小麦增产，主要依靠提高每亩的产量，因而加强麦田冬季田间管理是增产的关键。加以北方去秋因旱种麦较迟，南方后期补种的也较迟，这都需要加强浇灌、追肥、田间管理等措施来加以补救。
    冬小麦种植面积虽比过去减少，但全部冬季作物的总播种面积则比上年略有增加。其中，油菜籽播种面积达三千六百多万亩，比上年增加二百多万亩。作为南方水稻区主要肥源之一的绿肥作物，种植面积大约比上年增加一千万亩左右。只要各地农民能够认真加强田间管理，防治各种可能遭遇的灾害，今年各项冬季作物，包括冬小麦的总产量仍可能比往年增加。
    据了解，在冬季生产高潮中，大部地区的冬季作物田间管理工作做得较好。截至封冻前的不完全统计，山东、河北、河南、陕西、甘肃、江苏等六省已经浇麦四千二百多万亩。例如山东省浇麦面积比上年同期增加了六倍。南方各省还注意在麦田里进行开沟、排水和防冻工作。全国大部分地区的油菜也都经过了除草、追肥、防冻等田间管理工作。
    但是生长不好的冬季作物以及植物生长过旺，需要防治病虫害等不利因素仍然存在，因此必须加强管理。根据各地经验，设立专门机构、指定专人负责田间管理，把农村整风运动和冬季生产结合起来进行等，都是促进冬季作物田间管理工作的有效办法。在目前，要注意充分利用冬季已经大量兴修的水利工程和增积的肥料，尽量扩大春灌、追肥面积，做好锄耙保墒、防止霜冻灾害（南方还要做好开沟排水）等春季管理工作。
    本报特约新华社31日讯　小麦产量和播种面积占全国60％左右的河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、安徽六省农民，正在开展小麦大面积丰产运动，争取实现今年的小麦大跃进增产。
    去年冬天小麦播种时节，这些省遭到了几十年来少有的干旱。当地农民虽然顽强地进行抗旱抢种，但冬小麦的播种面积仍比1956年少了五百多万亩，部分地区麦田还发生了比较严重的缺苗断垅现象。因此，这六个省农民除了加强麦田管理工作外，普遍地采取培育小麦丰产田的增产措施，力争一亩小麦收获两亩的产量。据不完全统计，六省共建立小麦丰产田八千六百多万亩，相当于六省小麦冬播面积的35％，接近全国冬小麦播种面积的四分之一。这些丰产田的每亩平均产量计划都在二百斤以上，一般都比本省1957年的每亩平均产量高一倍左右。这些丰产计划实现后，这六省就等于今年比去年多种了八千多万亩冬小麦。这样不仅弥补去冬播种面积的减少（全国减少了八百多万亩）和部分地区麦田缺苗可能造成的减产损失，而且可以使今年的小麦总产量比去年增加。
    入冬以来，这六个省农民在大规模兴修水利和积肥的同时，普遍进行了以浇水和追肥为中心的麦田管理工作。不少地区农民还推行了河南省创造的“五水三肥”（给麦子浇五次水上三次肥）运动。例如山东省两千万亩小麦丰产田和河北省一千四百万亩丰产田部分或者几乎全部都施了追肥，并且在封冻前，这些麦田的大部分或全部都浇了一遍两遍甚至三遍水。当大地封冻后，各地农民又冒着严寒向麦田移雪搬冰和进行镇压保墒等活动。对一般麦田的管理工作，也大大加强。河南省七千多万亩冬小麦中，已有五千多万亩施肥一次到两次。陕西省关中和汉中地区的农民，80％到90％以上的麦田施了追肥，一般施肥面积都比去年同期多20％左右。
    由于进行了一系列工作，目前这六省大部分地区的麦苗生长茁壮。河南、陕西等省今年的麦苗扎根深、分蘖多，更是往年所少见。
