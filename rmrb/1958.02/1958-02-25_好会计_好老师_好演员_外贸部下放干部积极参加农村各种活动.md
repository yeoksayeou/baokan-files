　　Good Accountant, Good Teacher, Good Actor
　　Cadres Transferred from the Ministry of Foreign Trade Actively Participate in Various Rural Activities
　　(Our Newspaper Reporter Zheng Qimin) Cadres from the Ministry of Foreign Trade who went to Xingtai Special Zone, Hebei Province, for labor training have, in the two months since their transfer, actively participated in agricultural production. In their spare time, many also voluntarily help agricultural cooperatives clear their accounts, teach young and middle-aged farmers to read and write, and assist cooperative cadres in carrying out rural cultural and recreational activities.
　　In the past, many agricultural cooperatives in Xingtai Special Zone were unable to settle their accounts on time due to the low professional level of their accountants, large number of accounts, and busy workload. After these transferred cadres arrived at the cooperatives, many voluntarily helped the accountants settle the accounts in their spare time. According to statistics from Longyao County, 80% of the transferred cadres participated in the accounting work of agricultural cooperatives in their spare time. The agricultural cooperatives where the transferred cadres were located not only cleared their past accounts, but were also generally able to achieve daily and monthly settlements, ensuring no outstanding accounts. In order to solve the accounting problems of agricultural cooperatives more thoroughly, the eight accountants who were transferred to Longyao County for labor training also used their spare time to research and formulate a set of simple and easy-to-implement accounting systems for agricultural cooperatives.
　　Helping farmers learn to read, study culture, and assisting local cultural and educational departments in eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged farmers has also become a trend among the transferred cadres. Currently, 60% of the more than 650 transferred cadres have served as teachers in people's schools and literacy classes. The cadres transferred to Gucheng Township and Dayan Village in Longyao County also organized local primary school graduates and young and middle-aged farmers with the equivalent of senior primary school education to establish two spare-time middle schools. Classes are held three evenings a week, and on the other three evenings, these spare-time middle school students go to various villages to carry out literacy work. Using this method, they quickly set off a high tide of cultural learning in Gucheng Township. Wang Yatian, a cadre transferred to Guanzhuang Village, Neiqiu County, also adopted the method of guaranteeing teaching and learning, and eliminated illiteracy among twelve people in two months of spare time.
　　Many transferred cadres also help farmers carry out cultural and recreational activities, and through these activities, they vividly publicize the Party and the country's current policies to the farmers, which greatly helps rural work. Chen Zhesheng, a cadre transferred to Longyao County, has compiled more than a dozen clapper talks in coordination with the current rural work of conscription, eliminating the four pests, accumulating fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects. He uses the time before and after farmers eat and during labor breaks to perform them, which powerfully publicizes the Party's policies. Some transferred cadres also take advantage of various opportunities to teach young farmers to sing and perform two-person comic shows, etc.
　　Many farmers treat the transferred cadres like their own relatives. The transferred cadres Tian Ken and Wang Yaxian live in the home of farmer Han Xiaodong in Beiyang Village, Neiqiu County. Every morning, they carry water, sweep the yard, and clean the manure pit for Han Xiaodong's family. When they return from work in the evening, they also help their landlords cook. The old couple Han Xiaodong are very happy. Old lady Han also gave Tian Ken and Wang Yaxian two names: Tian Ken is called "Tianxi" (Adding Joy), and Wang Yaxian is called "Laixi" (Bringing Joy). While calling "Tianxi" and "Laixi," the old lady said with tears of excitement: "I have never had a son or daughter-in-law in my life, and I have never encountered happy events. Your arrival is a double blessing." When Ji Mingdao, a transferred cadre, first arrived in Duanzhuang, Shahe County, he could not learn how to chop grass. Production captain Duan Helai patiently taught him hand in hand until Ji Mingdao had completely learned it, and Duan Helai felt relieved. When Li Baochi, a cadre transferred to Qianliu Village, Lincheng County, fell ill, his landlord, an old lady, asked for sick leave for him, bought medicine, and made noodle soup, busy until midnight without sleeping.

### 好会计　好老师　好演员  外贸部下放干部积极参加农村各种活动

    好会计　好老师　好演员
    外贸部下放干部积极参加农村各种活动
    本报讯　记者郑启民报道：中央对外贸易部到河北邢台专区劳动锻炼的干部，下放两个月来除了积极参加劳动生产外，许多人还能在劳动余暇，主动帮助农业社清算账目，教青壮年农民读书认字，协助社干部开展农村的文化娱乐活动。
    过去，邢台专区有许多农业社由于会计人员业务水平低，账目多，工作忙，致使许多账目不能按时结算。这些下放干部到社以后，许多人在业余时间自动帮助会计人员结算账目。据隆尧县统计，下放干部在业余时间参加农业社会计工作的占总数的80％。下放干部所在的农业社不仅过去的账目算清了，一般还能做到日清月结，保证不留后账。为了比较彻底地解决农业社的会计工作问题，下放到隆尧县劳动锻炼的八个会计师，还利用业余时间研究制定了一套简单易行的农业社会计制度。
    帮助农民识字，学文化，协助地方文教部门在青壮年农民中扫除文盲的工作，在下放干部中也形成了热潮。目前，在六百五十多个下放干部中，已有60％的人担任了民校教员和扫盲识字班的教师。下放到隆尧县古城乡和大言村的干部，还把当地的小学毕业生和相当于高小文化程度的青壮年农民组织起来，成立了两所业余中学。每周有三个晚上上课，另外三个晚上，这些业余中学的学生，便分别到各村去担任扫盲工作。他们运用这种办法，在古城乡很快地掀起了学习文化的高潮。下放到内丘县官庄村的干部王亚田还采用包教包学的办法，在两个月的业余时间内扫除了十二个文盲。
    许多下放干部还帮助农民开展文化娱乐活动，并且通过这个活动，生动地向农民宣传了党和国家当前的各项政策，对农村工作帮助很大。下放到隆尧县的干部陈哲生，配合当前农村征兵、除四害、积肥和兴修水利等工作，编写了十多个快板，利用农民吃饭前后和劳动休息时间演唱，有力地宣传了党的政策。有的下放干部，还利用各种机会教青年农民唱歌、演双簧等。
    许多农民对待下放干部像对自己的亲人一样。下放干部田恳和王雅贤，他们住在内丘县北阳村农民韩小东家里。天天早晨给韩小东家担水，扫院子，收拾粪坑。晚上劳动回来，还帮助房东烧火做饭。韩小东老俩口心里喜得美滋滋的。韩老太太还给田恳和王雅贤起了两个名字：田恳叫“添喜”，王雅贤叫“来喜”。老太太一面叫着“添喜”和“来喜”，一面激动地流着眼泪说：“我这一辈子没生过儿子，没娶过媳妇，没有遇见过喜事，你俩来了，这是双喜临门”。下放干部冀明道初到沙河县端庄时，学铡草，怎么也学不会，生产队长端合来便耐心地掰着手教，直到冀明道完全学会了，端合来才放了心。下放到临城县前留村的干部李宝池生了病，房东老太太给他请病假、买药、做面汤，忙的半夜不睡觉。
