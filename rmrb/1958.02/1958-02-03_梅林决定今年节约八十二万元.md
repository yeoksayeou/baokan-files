　　Meilin Decides to Save 820,000 Yuan This Year
　　(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 2nd dispatch) The Shanghai Joint State-Private Meilin Canned Food Factory has decided to raise its savings target for this year from the originally planned 450,000 yuan to 820,000 yuan. This was unanimously proposed by all employees of the factory after a more in-depth discussion.
　　For nearly half a month, when discussing savings plans, many departments and workshops in the Meilin Factory cited facts and requested revisions to the original savings targets. For example, the Supply and Sales Department originally planned to save 150,000 yuan this year. During the discussion, it was found that there was still potential to be tapped. For example, when making canned pork, the meat yield was low because the bones were not removed cleanly. If attention is paid to improving operating methods and the meat yield is increased by another 5%, 200,500 yuan can be saved. After these key departments discussed and revised the savings targets, all the factory's employees were enthusiastic and motivated, everyone tapping potential, carefully calculating everything, and finding more ways to save.

　　梅林决定今年节约八十二万元
    本报上海2日电　上海公私合营梅林罐头食品厂决定把今年的节约指标，从原订的四十五万元提高到八十二万元，这是全厂职工经过更为深入的讨论后一致提出的。
    近半个月以来，梅林厂的职工在讨论节约方案时，许多科室、车间的职工举出事实，要求修订原来的节约指标。如供销科，原计划今年节约十五万元，讨论时发现还有潜力可挖，例如做猪肉罐头时，因为拆骨不干净，出肉率较低，如果注意改进操作方法，再提高出肉率5％，就可以节约二十万零五千元。经过这些关键部门的讨论和修订节约指标，全厂职工热情振奋，人人挖潜力，事事算细账，找出了更多的节约办法。
