    The Scots are Taking Action
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan

    Not long ago, a Conservative Member of Parliament named Boothby questioned the Scottish Office of the British Ministry of Defense, demanding confirmation of the news that two American missile bases would be established in his constituency—East Aberdeenshire. The latter's answer was: "Your guess is a clever one!"

    It seems that no one doubts that the United States has chosen to establish missile bases on the east coast of Scotland. Sources say that this was decided as early as last October during the meeting between Macmillan and Eisenhower.

    Every honest Scotsman cannot but begin to consider: what will the establishment of American missile bases on their land bring them? As the Scottish Trades Union Congress pointed out, it will disrupt the peaceful life of the Scottish people, it will deter entrepreneurs from establishing new industries around the bases, and it will make Scotland a target for attack in future wars... This is a serious issue concerning the life and death of the Scottish people. Faced with this urgent situation, the Scottish people have resolutely launched a struggle against American bases.

    On the first night of our arrival in Glasgow (located in western Scotland, it is Scotland's largest city with a population of over one million), a mass rally against the bases, the largest and most successful in ten years, was held there. The hall with 2,500 seats was packed. It is said that some people came specifically from fifteen miles away. The next day, we met the Dean of Canterbury, Johnson, who spoke at the conference. He told us: "The Scottish people have a tradition of struggle, and their unity is particularly important in the anti-base struggle. If they do not agree to establish missile bases on their land, the British government will not be able to do anything."

    That same day at noon, the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Mr. Andrew Hood, received us.

    "I was the first to sign the anti-base protest letter put forward by the Scottish Labour Party." He proudly began with this sentence. When asked about the consequences of establishing missile bases in Scotland, he believed without a doubt: "This will mean disaster for the Scottish people!"

    Two days later, we met the Lord Provost again at a press conference. At this meeting, he, as an ordinary voter in the Scotstoun constituency, was the first to sign a petition protesting against the missile bases.

    This petition, which is preparing to collect more than 30,000 signatures, was initiated by the voters of the Scotstoun constituency. Because the disgraceful behavior of James Hutchison, the Conservative Member of Parliament produced in this constituency, aroused great anger among the voters. This Conservative MP openly stated in the British House of Commons: "I think Scotland is prepared to accept (the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army) deems necessary this base, and is proud of it!"

    The voters want to send the petition directly to this member of parliament. The petition reads: "We, the voters of the Scotstoun constituency, although we have different political views, we unanimously and firmly oppose your statement about the United States establishing missile bases in Scotland." "We ask you to try out your statement at a mass meeting in your constituency. Whom does it represent?"

    Everyone knows that a considerable number of workers in eastern Scotland are unemployed. The British government has taken advantage of this, using it as bait through its propaganda machine, clamoring loudly: "The establishment of bases will bring bread to the workers...."

    But the workers' answer is: "No work for the bases!" On the third day of our arrival in Glasgow, more than 7,000 plumbers in West Scotland passed a resolution refusing to work for the bases. Not long ago, the Scottish Labour Party requested the British Labour Party Executive Committee to launch a strong anti-base movement. The Scottish Trades Union Congress has passed a resolution against the bases and called on workers to refuse to work for the bases. Many city, town councils, and trade unions have passed similar resolutions.

    Someone told me that various labor movement organizations and social groups have become involved in the struggle against the bases, which is a prominent and rare phenomenon in Scotland.

    We visited many ordinary Scots. In contact with these simple people, you will find how strong a sense of national pride and anti-American sentiment is hidden in them. Even those who are indifferent to everything will tell you: "We don't like Americans."

    Once, we went to visit a mechanic's home. He used the phrase "I don't know" to answer all questions. But when the mention was made of the United States establishing missile bases in Scotland, he immediately said in a disgusted tone: "The Americans only brag, and the Scots will not welcome them."

    We also met an elderly person who simply could not believe that laboring farmers "should be the masters of the land." In his opinion, "only landlords are the true creators of wealth." However, when it comes to the United States, he would gnash his teeth and say: "The United States is disrupting world peace. People like Dulles should die sooner rather than later..."

    However, you can get clearer and more powerful answers from some enlightened Scots. They said: "If the Americans start establishing missile bases in Scotland, we will not hesitate to take action."

    In fact, this resistance has already begun.

    In the small town of Witzburgh, twenty miles from Glasgow, live Mr. and Mrs. Griherst, both doctors, who since last summer have collected more than 1,000 signatures, about one-third of the town's adults. Last September, they submitted a petition with more than 500 signatures to Macmillan, demanding a stop to hydrogen bomb tests. But the Prime Minister openly lied to his citizens in his reply, insisting that hydrogen bomb tests are not very harmful to people... This ridiculous letter is still displayed in the waiting room of the two doctors. After patients read it, more people sign the petition. The doctor couple told me: Scots are not used to and do not easily leave their names to others. Therefore, their work of collecting signatures is quite difficult. On the patient's medical record, they marked those who signed and those who did not, and then repeatedly persuaded those who were unwilling to sign until they agreed to sign. Mr. and Mrs. Griherst said that they are confident that in the next six months, all adults in the town will sign the petition against the missile bases. They will submit these petitions to the United Nations.

    The struggle against missile bases is only just beginning. It is said that American missiles will arrive in the United Kingdom by the end of this year; the construction of the bases will begin soon. Scottish land will be contaminated. Scotland will become the frontline of American "defense." However, the Scots will not sit idly by and let themselves be reduced to this fate. On February 21, the Glasgow City Council passed a resolution against the United States establishing missile bases in the United Kingdom. Therefore, a sharper new struggle is brewing.

### 苏格兰人行动起来了

    苏格兰人行动起来了
    本报记者　苏蓝
    不久以前，一位名叫布斯比的保守党议员，向英国国防部苏格兰办事处提出质问，要求证实这样一个消息：两个美国导弹基地将在他的选区——东阿伯丁——建立起来。后者的回答是：“你的猜测很聪明”！
    似乎无人怀疑，美国已选定在苏格兰的东海岸建立导弹基地。有消息说，这件事早在去年10月麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔会谈时就已经决定了。
    每一个正直的苏格兰人，都不能不开始考虑：美国的导弹基地建立在自己的土地上，将会给他们带来什么？正如苏格兰职工大会指出的，它将破坏苏格兰人民的和平生活，它将使企业家不敢在基地周围建立新的工业，它将使苏格兰在未来战争中成为被攻击的目标……。这是有关苏格兰人民的生死存亡的严重问题。面对着这个紧急的局面，苏格兰人民坚决地展开了反对美国基地的斗争。
    在我们到达格拉斯哥市（位于苏格兰西部，是人口一百万以上的苏格兰的最大城市）的头一天晚上，那里举行了一个十年来最大的、最成功的反基地群众大会。拥有二千五百个座位的大厅里挤满了人。据说，有些人是从十五英里以外特地赶来的。第二天，我们会见了在大会上发表演说的坎特伯雷教长约翰逊。他告诉我们：“苏格兰人民是有斗争传统的，而在反基地斗争中，他们的团结就显得特别重要。如果他们不答应在自己的土地上建立导弹基地，英国政府就什么也干不成。”
    就在同一天中午，格拉斯哥市的市长安德茹·胡德先生接见了我们。
    “我，第一个在苏格兰工党提出的反基地抗议书上签了名。”他自豪地以这样一句话开始。当问到他在苏格兰建立导弹基地的后果时，他毫不怀疑地认为：“这将意味着给苏格兰人民带来灾难！”
    两天之后，我们又一次在记者招待会上见到了这位市长。在这个会上，他以苏格斯顿选区一个普通选民的身份，在抗议导弹基地的请愿书上首先签名。
    这个准备征集三万多人签名的请愿书，是由苏格斯顿选区的选民们发起的。因为在这个选区中产生的保守党议员詹姆士·赫其逊的可耻行为，激起了选民们的极大愤怒。这位保守党议员曾在英国下院公然声称：“我认为苏格兰准备接受（北大西洋集团军）最高统帅认为必要的这种基地，并以此为荣！”
    选民们要把请愿书直接送给这位议员。请愿书上写道：“我们苏格斯顿选区的选民们，虽然有着不同的政治见解，但我们一致坚决反对你发表的关于美国在苏格兰设立导弹基地的声明。”“我们要求你在你的选区的群众大会上，来试试你的声明代表什么人？”
    谁都知道，在苏格兰东部有相当一部分工人正处于失业状态。英国政府就利用这一点，通过它的宣传机器，以此为诱饵大嚷大叫：“建立基地将为工人带来面包……。
    但工人们的回答是：“不为基地工作！”就在我们到达格拉斯哥的第三天，西苏格兰区的七千多水管工人通过了拒绝为基地工作的决议。不久以前，苏格兰工党要求英国工党执委会开展一个强有力的反基地运动。苏格兰职工大会已通过了反对基地的决议，并号召工人拒绝为基地工作。许多市、镇议会和行业工会都通过了类似的决议。
    有人告诉我，各种各样的劳工运动组织和社会团体，都卷入了反对基地的斗争，这在苏格兰是一个突出的、少有的现象。
    我们访问了许多普通的苏格兰人，在和这些朴实的人民接触中，你会发觉在他们身上蕴藏着多么强烈的民族自豪感和反美情绪。即使是对一切事物都漠不关心的人，也会告诉你：“我们不喜欢美国人”。
    有一次，我们到一个机械工人家里去作客。他用“我不知道”这么一句话来回答所有问题。但当提到美国要在苏格兰建立导弹基地时，他立刻以厌恶的口吻说：“美国人只会吹牛，苏格兰人不会欢迎他们”。
    我们还遇到过这样一位老年人，他简直不能相信劳动农民“应该是土地的主人”。在他看来，“只有地主才是财富的真正创造者”。可是，当谈到美国时，他就会咬牙切齿地说：“美国扰乱了世界和平，像杜勒斯这种人早点死就好了……。”
    然而，你从一些觉悟了的苏格兰人口中，可以得到更加明确有力的回答。他们说：“如果美国人开始在苏格兰建立导弹基地，我们会毫不犹豫地行动起来的。”
    事实上，这种反抗行动已经开始了。
    在离格拉斯哥二十英里的威茨伯小镇上，住着格里赫斯特夫妇，这两位医生从去年夏季以来，已经搜集了一千多人签名，约占该镇成年人的三分之一。去年9月，他们把五百多人的签名书呈递给麦克米伦，要求停止氢弹试验。但这位首相在回信中却公开向他的公民扯谎，硬说氢弹试验对人的危害不大……。这封滑稽可笑的信，到现在还摆在两位医生的候诊室中，当病人们读了它以后，就有更多的人在请愿书上签了名。医生夫妇告诉我：苏格兰人是不习惯也不轻易把自己的名字留给别人的。因此，他们搜集签名的工作是相当艰苦的。他们在病人的病历表上，把签了名的和未签名的都作了记号，然后对那些不愿签名的人一次又一次地进行说服，直到他们同意签名为止。格里赫斯特夫妇说，他们有信心在今后六个月中，使全镇的成年人都在反对导弹基地的请愿书上签名。他们将把这些请愿书交给联合国。
    反对导弹基地的斗争，现在仅只是开始。据说，美国的导弹将在今年年底运抵英国；基地的修建工作，不久以后就将开始。苏格兰的土地将被沾污。苏格兰将变为美国“国防”的前线。但是，苏格兰人是不会坐视使自己沦于这种命运的。2月21日，格拉斯哥市议会通过一项决议，反对美国在英国建立导弹基地。因此，一场更加尖锐的新的斗争，正在酝酿中。
