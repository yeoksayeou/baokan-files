　　Feigned Caution
　　When news of Indonesian rebels declaring an illegal so-called "government" in Central Sumatra reached Washington, U.S. government officials deliberately refrained from expressing their views, saying it was "too early" to comment.

　　But this feigned caution cannot conceal the real joy in their hearts. United Press pointed out that one of the leaders of the Central Sumatra rebels, Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, was "well-liked by certain officials in Washington." The news agency even undisguisedly revealed that the reason Washington officials were temporarily refraining from commenting was merely to wait and see if this government "could gain support from other parts of the outer islands, thereby becoming a confrontational organization to seize control of all of Indonesia."

　　This makes it even clearer what Dulles' intention was in publicly attacking the Indonesian government a few days ago.

    假装的谨慎
    当印度尼西亚叛乱分子在中苏门答腊宣布成立非法的所谓“政府”的消息传到了华盛顿后，美国的政府官员故意不表示态度，说什么现在发表任何意见还“太早”。
    但是这种假装的谨慎是掩盖不住他们心中的真正高兴的。合众社就指出，中苏门答腊叛乱分子的头目之一沙弗鲁丁，“很受华盛顿某些官员的赏识”。这家通讯社甚至毫不隐讳地透露，华盛顿官员所以暂不表示意见，不过是要等待看一看这个政府“到底能否从外围岛屿的其他地方得到支持，从而成为夺取全印度尼西亚控制权的一个对抗的组织”。
    这样就使人更清楚地看出，杜勒斯前几天公开发表攻击印度尼西亚政府的言论的用意何在了。
