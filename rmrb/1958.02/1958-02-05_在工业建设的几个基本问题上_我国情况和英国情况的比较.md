Comrade Qian Changzhao's Speech
　　After analysis, he believes that: steel production can catch up with Britain in fifteen years; coal production can catch up with Britain in five years; cement production can surpass Britain in ten years; fertilizer production can far exceed Britain in five years; and metal cutting machine tools can surpass Britain in ten years.
　　Please allow me to talk about the issue of China catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer.
　　Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the united efforts of the people of the whole country, China's First Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed and overfulfilled. During the First Five-Year Plan, we have established a socialist economic system and a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. The great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan have severely hit the imperialist elements and the domestic bourgeois rightists. The imperialist elements once said: "It is an illusion for China to implement a planned economy and implement a Five-Year Plan, it is like reaching for the moon"; the domestic bourgeois rightists once said: "China's First Five-Year Plan has been messed up." These shameless slanders have been shattered by vivid facts.
　　On the basis of the victory of the First Five-Year Plan and on the basis of the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, we are now starting the Second Five-Year Plan. The main task of the Second Five-Year Plan is to implement the policy put forward by the Party Central Committee of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, to build the country diligently and thriftily, starting from 600 million people, taking overall consideration and making appropriate arrangements. The people of the whole country are welcoming this great task with full confidence, ensuring that China's socialist construction will advance from victory to victory.
　　At the same time as starting the Second Five-Year Plan, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued a call of great significance to the people of the whole country, that is, to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer. We believe that it is entirely possible to realize this call, and we have full confidence in it.
　　At this moment, I would like to compare China's situation with that of Britain on several basic issues in industrial construction.
　　I. On the issue of economic system
　　China is a newborn socialist country and has established an advanced socialist economic system. Britain is an aging imperialist country and maintains a decadent capitalist economic system. Two systems, two trends. In the socialist economy, the public ownership of the means of production is suitable for the social nature of production. The planned development of the socialist economy guarantees the high-speed growth of production and ensures that the material and cultural needs of the people are continuously met. In the capitalist economy, there is an insurmountable contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of the means of production. The development of capitalist production is subject to the law of surplus value and the activities of capitalists pursuing high profits. Therefore, it is impossible to carry out planned leadership, and it is impossible to avoid the anarchy of production and periodic economic crises.
　　II. On the issue of construction direction
　　China has always adopted a peaceful diplomatic policy. We want peaceful coexistence, we do not want an arms race. Our peaceful construction is to change the backwardness of China's economy, expand and improve the material basis of people's lives, and prepare to build China into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in three five-year plans or a little longer. Britain is different. It has been following the United States and dare not give up the Cold War. The heavy military burden is imposed on the people. During the Labour Party's rule, the so-called "Attlee Plan" was implemented, and 4.7 billion pounds were directly used for military purposes. After the Conservative Party came to power, it further invested in the nuclear weapons race. Ten percent of the gross national product, one-eighth of metal products, and seven percent of the working population are spent on military affairs. The militarization of the national economy is fundamentally restricting the development of British production.
　　III. On the issue of labor force
　　The 600 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have a fine tradition of diligence and bravery. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the change in production relations and the liberation of productive forces, the people have become masters of their own affairs, fully exerting their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, and production upsurges have followed one after another. After the three major transformations, the five major movements, and the recent nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, political consciousness has been raised to an unprecedented level. There is no doubt that China can promote various socialist construction undertakings with more, faster, better, and more economical results in a relatively short period of time. Britain has a population of only over 50 million, and monopoly capital organizations control the economic lifeline of Britain. They have always used state organs to carry out unlimited exploitation of the working people. In recent years, they have intensified their efforts. In the name of anti-inflation, they have adopted various methods in an attempt to lower wages. The class contradictions in Britain are becoming increasingly acute. The total amount of strike time in the last three years is more than double that of the three years before the war.
　　IV. On the issue of resources
　　China has a large territory and abundant resources. In terms of minerals, after the liberation, thanks to the hard work of geological staff, investigations and surveys have proved that the reserves greatly exceed the estimates before the liberation. The reserves of iron ore are estimated to be over 12 billion tons; the prospective reserves of coal are about 1 trillion tons; tungsten, tin, and molybdenum rank first in the world; in addition, copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, sulfur, phosphorus, etc. are very abundant; investigations are continuing, and there will definitely be more discoveries. Britain has a small territory and limited resources. The reserves of iron ore are estimated to be less than 3.8 billion tons, and the iron content is very low, averaging about 30 percent; the prospective reserves of coal are about 173.9 billion tons; non-ferrous metals are very scarce. In the past, it relied on colonies to plunder arbitrarily. After the Second World War, national independence movements surged up. Some colonies have won independence, and some are in fierce struggle. This major change has fundamentally shaken the British Empire's foundation of exploitation on a global scale.
　　V. On the issue of industrial level
　　China's industrial level is currently not as good as Britain's. In terms of steel, China's output is only one-quarter of Britain's; in terms of coal, it is only a little more than one-half; in terms of cement, it is also only a little more than one-half; in terms of chemical fertilizers, it is only one-fifth; in terms of metal cutting machine tools, it is less than half. However, China has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization during the First Five-Year Plan, basically changing the incomplete and uncoordinated state of China's industry in the past, and has reasonably strengthened and established several industrial bases; trained a considerable technical force; and fully utilized new equipment and new technologies. Although Britain's current industrial level is higher than ours, due to the old foundation and the control of monopoly capital organizations, comprehensive technological innovation is almost impossible. In recent years, some industries have indeed used some new equipment and new technologies, but they are individual and very localized.
　　VI. On the issue of the market for industrial products
　　China has an extremely vast domestic market. According to the plan, the development of industry and the sales of products will not be a problem. At the same time, the vast domestic market will provide conditions for the further development of industry at any time. The British economy relies heavily on exports. Industrial products account for a large proportion of export items. Thirty percent of British industrial products are used for export. Therefore, the export market for industrial products has become a major factor determining British economic activity. After the Second World War, initially, due to the withdrawal of Germany and Japan from the world market, British exports made some progress. Now, West Germany and Japan have re-entered the world market, and their momentum is very strong; competition from the United States is becoming increasingly fierce; the colonial market has undergone fundamental changes; and trade with socialist countries is still subject to embargoes for fear of offending the United States. In short, the prospect of British exports is quite bleak, which will inevitably affect the development of the domestic economy.
　　VII. On the issue of international cooperation
　　The international relations between socialist countries are a combination of patriotism and internationalism. During China's First Five-Year Plan, the reason why the national construction work was able to have such a large scale and such a fast speed is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. In terms of science and technology, China has also signed cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to jointly conduct research and investigation work, coordinate with each other on important issues of science and technology, and help each other in the training of scientific and technological experts. The international relations between capitalist countries are the opposite. They intrigue with each other, compete for resources, and compete for markets. As far as Britain is concerned: on the one hand, it bullies weak countries, and on the other hand, it is busy dealing with the United States, which is riding on its head. For many years, Britain has actually played the role of a junior partner of the United States. Within the capitalist world, the United States excludes Britain everywhere, and often blatantly interferes in the affairs of the British people and the country. Despite the growing wave of anti-American sentiment among the British people, the British government has never had the courage to re-evaluate its policy towards the United States. Under these unequal circumstances, real cooperation is out of the question, whether in the economic or scientific and technological fields.
　　After comparing several basic issues in industrial construction, it is not difficult to imagine that the speed of China's industrial progress will be much higher than that of Britain. During China's First Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of industrial production was 18.3 percent, while Britain's was only 3.9 percent during the same period, which is a good proof. Now, let's analyze why the output of important industries such as steel, coal, cement, chemical fertilizers, and metal cutting machine tools in China can catch up with or surpass Britain in fifteen years:
　　China's steel production may reach 40 million tons by 1972. Britain's steel production in 1956 was 20.99 million tons. Even if we overestimate it, according to the average annual growth rate of 3.9 percent of Britain's steel production from 1938 to 1956, it will only be more than 38.6 million tons by 1972. By that time, we will have caught up with Britain. China's coal production may reach 230 million tons by 1962. Britain's coal production in 1956 was 225.54 million tons. For more than 40 years, Britain's coal production has often shown a downward trend. In 1956, it was more than 66 million tons less than in 1913. Due to the old foundation, technological innovation is extremely difficult. Due to the lack of certainty in the market, it may still be at about the same level as in 1956 by 1962. By that time, we may have caught up with Britain. China's cement production may reach 12.5 million tons by 1962. In another five years, by 1967, even if we underestimate the annual growth rate at 10 percent, it will be around 20 million tons. Britain's cement production in 1956 was 12.97 million tons. Even if we overestimate it, according to the average annual growth rate of 2.8 percent of Britain's cement production from 1938 to 1956, it will only be more than 17.6 million tons by 1967. By that time, we will have surpassed Britain. China's chemical fertilizer production may reach 7 million tons by 1962. Britain's chemical fertilizer production in 1956 was 3.52 million tons. Even if we overestimate it, according to the average annual growth rate of 3 percent of Britain's chemical fertilizer production from 1951 to 1956, it will only be more than 4.1 million tons by 1962. By that time, we will have far surpassed Britain. China's metal cutting machine tool production may reach 60,000 units by 1962. In another five years, by 1967, even if we underestimate the annual growth rate at 10 percent, it will be around 96,600 units. Britain's metal cutting machine tool production in 1956 was about 61,500 units. Even if we overestimate it, according to the average annual growth rate of 3.1 percent of Britain's metal cutting machine tool production from 1951 to 1956, it will only be more than 85,900 units by 1967. By that time, we will have surpassed Britain.
　　In addition to the above five important industries, we believe that the output of other important industries will also catch up with or surpass Britain in fifteen years or a little longer.
　　Fellow representatives, in fifteen years, the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture will catch up with or surpass the United States in the output of the most important products. In fifteen years or a little longer, China will catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products. By that time, human history will enter a new great turning point. "The socialist world will leave the imperialist countries far behind." In the peaceful competition between two different social systems, capitalism is destined to fail completely.
　　The future of the world will inevitably belong to the people, and it will inevitably belong to socialism.

　　在工业建设的几个基本问题上
    我国情况和英国情况的比较
　　钱昌照代表的发言
    他经过分析以后认为：钢产量十五年可以赶上英国；煤产量五年可以赶上英国；水泥产量十年可以赶过英国；化肥产量五年可以远远赶过英国；金属切削机床十年可以超过英国。
    请允许我谈一谈我国在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的问题。
    在中国共产党的正确领导下，在全国人民的团结努力下，我国第一个五年计划已经胜利地完成和超额完成了。在第一个五年计划期间，我们已经确立了社会主义的经济制度，我们也已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。第一个五年计划的伟大成就狠狠地打击了帝国主义分子和国内的资产阶级右派分子。帝国主义分子曾经说过：“中国实行计划经济，实行五年计划，乃是幻想，乃是伸手抓月亮”；国内的资产阶级右派分子曾经说过：“我国第一个五年计划搞坏了”。这些无耻谰言都被活生生的事实打得粉碎。
    在第一个五年计划胜利的基础上，在全民整风和反右派斗争胜利的基础上，我们正在开始第二个五年计划。第二个五年计划的主要任务是贯彻执行党中央提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，勤俭建国，从六亿人民出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排。全国人民满怀信心地迎接这一伟大任务，保证我国社会主义建设从胜利走向胜利。
    在开始第二个五年计划的同时，党中央和毛主席向全国人民发出了具有重大意义的号召，就是在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。我们认为实现这个号召是完全可能的，而且有充分把握的。
    我此刻就工业建设中几个基本问题，把我国的情况和英国作一比较。
    一、关于经济制度问题
    我国是新生的社会主义国家，已经确立了先进的社会主义经济制度，英国是衰老的帝国主义国家，保持着腐朽的资本主义经济制度。两个制度，两种趋势。在社会主义经济中，生产资料的公有制适合于生产的社会性，社会主义经济的计划发展，保证生产的高速度增长，保证人民物质文化的需要不断地得到满足。在资本主义经济中，生产的社会性与生产资料私有制之间存在着不可克服的矛盾，资本主义生产的发展，服从于剩余价值规律，服从于资本家追求高额利润的活动，因此不可能进行有计划的领导，也就无法避免生产的无政府状态，无法避免周期性的经济危机。
    二、关于建设方向问题
    我国一贯采取和平外交政策，我们要和平共处，我们不要军备竞赛，我们进行和平建设为的是改变我国经济的落后面貌，扩大、改善人民生活的物质基础，准备在三个五年计划或者再多一点的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。英国则不然，它一直跟着美国走，不敢放弃冷战，沉重的军事负担强加在人民头上，在工党执政时期，执行着所谓“艾德礼计划”，直接用在军事上的钱达到四十七亿英镑。保守党执政以后，更进一步投入核武器竞赛，国民生产毛值的百分之十，金属制品的八分之一，工作人口的百分之七都耗费在军事方面。国民经济的军事化正从根本上束缚着英国生产的发展。
    三、关于劳动力问题
    中国共产党领导下的六亿人民有勤劳勇敢的优良传统，中华人民共和国成立以后，由于生产关系的改变，由于生产力的解放，人民当家做主，充分发挥革命的积极性和创造性，生产高潮一个接着一个。经过三大改造、五大运动以及最近的全民整风和反右派斗争，政治觉悟更是空前提高。毫无疑问，我国可以在较短期间内又多、又快、又好、又省地推进各项社会主义建设事业。英国人口只有五千多万，垄断资本组织控制着英国的经济命脉，它们一贯利用国家机关对劳动人民进行无限制的剥削，近年来更是变本加厉，在反通货膨胀的名义下，采用各种各样的办法，企图压低工资，英国国内的阶级矛盾一天比一天尖锐化了。最近三年罢工时间的总和，较之战前三年，多至一倍以上。
    四、关于资源问题
    我国地方大，资源丰富，就矿产来说，解放以后由于地质工作人员的辛勤努力，经过调查勘测，证明储量大大超过解放以前的估计。铁矿石的储量估计在一百二十亿吨以上；煤的远景储量约为一万亿吨；钨、锡、钼居世界第一位；此外如铜、铅、锌、铝、锰、镁、硫、磷等都很丰富；现正继续查勘，肯定会有更多的发现。英国地方小，资源有限，铁矿石的储量估计不到三十八亿吨，含铁量很低，平均在百分之三十左右；煤的远景储量约为一千七百三十九亿吨；有色金属非常缺乏，过去依靠殖民地，肆意掠夺，第二次世界大战以后，民族独立运动，风起云涌，有些殖民地已经赢得独立，有些正在剧烈斗争中，这一重大变化，根本动摇了大英帝国在世界范围内的剥削基础。
    五、关于工业水平问题
    我国工业水平，目前不如英国，就钢来说，我国产量只有英国的四分之一；就煤来说，只有二分之一多一些；就水泥来说，也只有二分之一多一些；就化肥来说，只有五分之一；就金属切削机床来说，还不到一半，但是我国在第一个五年计划期间已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，基本上改变了我国工业过去残缺不全和互不配合的状态，合理地加强了和建立了好几个工业基地；锻炼了相当大的技术力量；充分运用了新的装备和新的技术。英国目前工业水平虽然较高于我，但由于底子旧，在垄断资本组织的控制下，全面性的技术革新几乎是不可能的，最近几年，某些工业确也运用了一些新装备和新技术，乃是个别的，很局部的。
    六、关于工业产品的市场问题
    我国有极其广大的国内市场，根据计划，发展工业，产品的销售不成问题，同时国内的广大市场又为工业随时提供进一步发展的条件。英国经济，在很大程度上，依赖出口，在出口项目中，工业产品占大部分，英国工业产品的百分之三十是用在出口的，因此工业产品的出口市场成为决定英国经济活动的一个主要因素。第二次世界大战以后，在资本主义世界范围内，最初由于德国、日本退出世界市场，英国出口有些进展，现在西德、日本重新进入世界市场，来势很猛；美国方面的竞争日益剧烈；殖民地的市场，发生了根本的变化；对社会主义国家的贸易，又以不敢得罪美国，仍在实施禁运。总之，英国出口前途相当黯淡，势必影响国内经济的发展。
    七、关于国际合作问题
    社会主义国家之间的国际关系是爱国主义和国际主义的结合。我国在第一个五年计划期间，国家建设工作，所以能够有这样大的规模，这样快的速度，和苏联的无私援助是分不开的。在科学技术上，我国又和苏联与其他社会主义国家签订合作协定，共同进行研究工作和考察工作，在科学技术的重要问题上则互相配合，在科技专家的培养上则互相帮助。资本主义国家之间的国际关系适得其反，它们勾心斗角，争夺资源，争夺市场。就英国来说：它一方面欺侮弱小国家，一方面穷于应付骑在它头上的美国，多少年来，英国实际上充当美国的小伙计的角色。在资本主义世界范围内，美国到处排挤英国，而且经常露骨干涉英国人民和国家的事务。尽管反美情绪的浪潮在英国人民中与日俱增，但英国政府始终没有勇气重新估计它的对美政策。在这种不平等的情况下，无论在经济方面，或者在科学技术方面，真正的合作是谈不到的。
    对工业建设中几个基本问题作了比较，不难想见我国工业进展的速度会大大高出英国，我国在第一个五年计划期间，工业生产每年平均增长率为百分之十八点三，英国同一时期只有百分之三点九，是个很好的证明。兹再就我国重要工业如钢、煤、水泥、化肥、金属切削机床等的产量，十五年内可以赶上或者超过英国一点加以分析：
    我国钢的产量到一九七二年可能达到四千万吨，英国一九五六年的钢产量为二千零九十九万吨，即使偏高估计，按照一九三八年至一九五六年英国钢产量的每年平均增长率百分之三点九推算，到一九七二年也只有三千八百六十多万吨，那时候我们已经赶上了英国。我国煤的产量到一九六二年可能达到二亿三千万吨，英国一九五六年的煤产量为二亿二千五百五十四万吨，四十多年来，英国的煤产量常呈下降趋势，一九五六年比一九一三年就少了六千六百多万吨，由于底子旧，技术革新极不容易，由于市场没有把握，到一九六二年也许还停留在一九五六年差不多的水平，那时候我们可能已经赶上了英国。我国水泥的产量到一九六二年可能达到一千二百五十万吨，再过五年，到一九六七年，即使按照每年增长率百分之十的偏低估计，也在二千万吨左右，英国一九五六年的水泥产量为一千二百九十七万吨，即使偏高估计，按照一九三八年至一九五六年英国水泥产量的每年平均增长率百分之二点八推算，到一九六七年也只有一千七百六十多万吨，那时候我们已经超过了英国。我国化肥的产量到一九六二年可能达到七百万吨，英国一九五六年的化肥产量为三百五十二万吨，即使偏高估计，按照一九五一年至一九五六年英国化肥的每年平均增长率百分之三推算，到一九六二年也只有四百一十多万吨，那时候我们已经远远地超过了英国。我国金属切削机床的产量一九六二年可能达到六万台，再过五年，到一九六七年，即使按照每年平均增长率百分之十的偏低估计，也在九万六千六百台左右，英国一九五六年金属切削机床的产量约为六万一千五百台，即使偏高估计，按照一九五一年至一九五六年英国金属切削机床的每年平均增长率百分之三点一推算，到一九六七年也只有八万五千九百多台，那时候我们也就超过英国了。
    除了上述五项重要工业以外，其他重要工业我们相信在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内其产量也一定可以赶上或者超过英国。
    各位代表，在十五年后苏联的工农业在最重要的产品的产量方面将会赶上或者超过美国，我国在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面将会赶上或者超过英国，那时候人类历史又将进入一个新的伟大的转折点，“社会主义世界将把帝国主义国家远远地抛在后面”。两种不同的社会制度在和平竞赛中，资本主义是注定要彻底失败的。
    世界的未来必然属于人民，必然属于社会主义。
