Xinhua News Agency, 31st - A person in charge of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission announced at a press conference held in Beijing today: In order to promote the development of sports in China and prepare for the 17th Olympic Games in 1960, a large-scale comprehensive sports meet—the First China National Games—will be held in Beijing in October 1959.
　　This sports meet, which will be held during the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China, is expected to have more than 3,000 male and female athletes participating, including twenty-three competition events such as track and field, weightlifting, and swimming. This will be the largest sports meet in Chinese history. In order to welcome this sports meet, a stadium capable of accommodating 50,000 spectators, to be built in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, will commence construction this year.
　　The person in charge of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission said that a great leap forward will also occur in China's sports work in 1958. In this year, it is necessary to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, rouse revolutionary vigor, continue to implement the policy of developing mass sports and accelerating the improvement of sports standards, and strive for more sports events to reach or approach international levels.
　　In 1958, grassroots sports activities will be further developed, especially the large-scale training of young athletes. Great achievements were made in this area in 1957. According to recent statistics, 850,000 people have passed various levels of the "Labor and Defense System" standards in 1957. As of 1957, more than 95,000 people nationwide have reached the standards for graded athletes; a total of 141 youth sports schools have been established in various regions.
　　Sports competitions are an important method for promoting mass sports, expanding the ranks of athletes, and improving sports standards. Therefore, in 1958, more competitions of various levels and sports events will be organized in a more planned manner. The various sports competition activities in 1958 will also be carried out in preparation for the first China National Games to be held in 1959.

　　中国人民体育运动大会
    将于一九五九年在北京举行
    新华社31日讯　体育运动委员会负责人今天在北京举行的一次记者招待会上宣布：为了推动中国体育运动的开展和准备参加1960年第十七届奥林匹克运动会，1959年10月间将在北京举行一次大规模的综合性的体育运动大会——第一届中国人民体育运动大会。
    这个将在新中国成立十周年时举行的运动大会，预计将有三千多名男女选手参加，包括田径、举重、游泳等二十三个比赛项目。这将是中国有史以来规模最大的一次体育运动大会。为了迎接这次运动大会，在北京东郊兴建的能容纳五万观众的运动场，将在今年动工。
    体育运动委员会的负责人说，1958年中国体育工作方面也将出现大跃进。这一年要克服右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，继续贯彻开展群众性的体育运动和加速提高运动水平的方针，争取更多运动项目的成绩达到或接近国际水平。
    1958年，将进一步开展基层的体育活动，特别是要大量地培养青、少年运动员。这方面的工作1957年曾经取得了很大成绩。据最近的统计，1957年已经有八十五万人分别通过了“劳卫制”各级标准。到1957年为止，全国已经有九万五千多人达到了等级运动员的标准；各地共建立了青、少年体育学校一百四十一所。
    体育运动竞赛是推动群众性体育运动、壮大运动员队伍和提高运动水平的重要方法。因此，1958年将要更有计划地组织更多运动项目的各级比赛。1958年的各项体育竞赛活动，还都将围绕着1959年举行的第一届中国人民体育运动大会来进行准备工作。
