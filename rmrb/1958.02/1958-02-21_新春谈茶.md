    New Year Talk on Tea
    Li Jingrui
    Tea is a common beverage in most households, and also an excellent choice for quenching thirst and sobering up after drinking and eating. For many years, it has been regarded as a precious item for drinking, entertaining guests, and gifting. The reason why tea is so popular is inseparable from the fact that it contains many beneficial components for the human body. These beneficial components are mainly:
    Theine: Also known as caffeine, is a stimulating alkaloid. It has the effects of refreshing the mind, strengthening the heart, diuresis, stimulating the central nervous system and gastric gland cells. Therefore, drinking tea can eliminate fatigue, activate thinking, promote blood circulation, and help digestion.
    Tannin: Can dissolve fat, coagulate bacterial proteins to achieve sterilization, and also carry unclean suspended matter in beverages for precipitation. Drinking a cup of strong tea after eating too much fatty meat can relieve greasiness and also promote bowel movements.
    Aromatic oil: Fragrant and palatable, it can stimulate the sense of smell and taste, giving people pleasure. Therefore, drinking tea often makes one feel fragrant and refreshing.
    Vitamin C: According to tests, 500 grams of green tea contains 135 milligrams of vitamin C after brewing.
    In addition, drinking more strong tea when drinking too much alcohol can excrete alcohol from the urine, and eliminate the fatigue caused by alcohol poisoning due to the stimulating effect of tea.
    Drinking tea has many benefits, but drinking too much or too strong is not good. Drinking too much can keep the nerves in a state of excitement for a long time, so it is easy to suffer from insomnia and neurasthenia. As for people with heart disease, high blood pressure, and excessive stomach acid, it is advisable to drink less tea, especially not strong tea, because drinking tea will increase the heart rate and blood pressure.
    There are many types and names of tea, but they mainly include the following:
    Black tea: It is made by withering, kneading, and fermenting fresh leaves. After brewing, the water color is red and bright, and the aroma is rich. China's Qimen black tea is one of the most famous high-grade teas in the world.
    Green tea: It uses high temperature to kill the enzymes in fresh leaves, maintaining the original emerald green color of the fresh leaves. The characteristics of green tea are fresh aroma and clear soup color. China is the world's largest green tea producer.
    Oolong tea: It is a unique semi-fermented tea produced in China. The bottom of the leaves after brewing is green in the middle and red on the outer edge, commonly known as "green leaves with red border." The characteristic of oolong tea is "the fragrance lasts longer and becomes clearer, and the taste lasts longer and becomes more mellow." It usually has a sweet aftertaste after drinking. Fujian's Wuyi rock tea, Anxi Tieguanyin, and Jianzhen narcissus are all examples.
    Scented tea: It is made by adding fresh flowers such as jasmine and magnolia to green tea. After brewing, the floral fragrance overflows, and the tea is sweet, leaving a long-lasting fragrance in the mouth after drinking.
    Compressed tea (brick tea): It is made by compressing fermented tea into various blocks, like a brick. Brick tea is deep in color and strong in taste, and it is durable and easy to carry. It is an indispensable necessity for ethnic minorities. Yunnan's Tuo tea is one of them.
    In addition, there are some special and precious teas, such as Longjing, Biluochun, and Maofeng, which are famous at home and abroad for their exquisite craftsmanship and pure and high fragrance.
    Generally speaking, black tea contains more theine and has a stronger taste, so drinking a cup of black tea when tired is easier to refresh the mind. Green tea contains more tannin and vitamin C, the tea color is clear and green, and it is cool and refreshing. Oolong tea has the characteristics of both red and green tea. Many people in Fujian, Guangdong, and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia like to drink oolong tea. Scented tea attracts many people with its unique aroma, and northerners mostly love to drink scented tea. As for tea bricks, because they are easy to dissolve fat, they are especially popular among ethnic minorities in border areas.

    新春谈茶
    李景瑞
    茶叶是一般家庭常备的一种饮料，也是酒醉饭饱后解渴、醒酒的良品。许多年来它都被人们当作饮用、待客和餽赠的珍品。茶叶之所以受到人们这样的喜好，这是与茶里边含有不少对人体有益的成分分不开的。这些有益的成分主要是：
    茶素：又叫咖啡因，是种有刺激作用的生物碱。它有提神、强心、利尿、兴奋神经中枢和胃腺细胞的功效，所以喝了茶，能消除疲劳，活跃思维，促进血液循环，并能帮助消化。
    单宁：能溶解脂肪，能凝固细菌的蛋白体而达到杀菌的作用，还能带着饮料中不洁的悬浮物而沉淀。吃多了肥肉时，喝杯浓茶可以解腻，还可以使大便通畅。
    芳香油：清香适口，能刺激嗅觉和味觉，给人以快感。所以喝了茶常觉芳香满口，沁人心脾。
    维生素丙：据化验，五百克绿茶冲泡后所含的维生素丙就有一百三十五毫克。
    此外，饮酒过量时，多喝浓茶可以把酒精从小便中排泄出去，并因茶的兴奋作用而消除中酒毒所引起的疲劳现象。
    喝茶的好处很多，但是喝得太多或太浓也不好。喝多了会使神经长期处于兴奋状态，因此易患失眠症及神经衰弱。至于患有心脏病、高血压以及胃酸过多的人，则以少喝茶为宜，尤其不要喝浓茶，因为喝茶会使心跳加快、血压增高。
    茶叶的种类和名称很多，但主要不外以下几种：
    红茶：它是将鲜叶经过萎雕、揉捻和醱酵而成。冲泡后水色红艳，香气馥郁。我国的祁门红茶是世界上最有名的高级茶之一。
    绿茶：它是用高温将鲜叶里的酵素杀死，保持鲜叶原有的翠绿色泽。绿茶的特点是香气新鲜，汤色清澈。我国是世界上最大的绿茶产国。
    乌龙茶：它是我国独产的半醱酵茶，冲泡后的叶底当中呈绿色，外沿呈红色，俗称“绿叶红镶边”。乌龙茶的特点是“香久益清，味久益醇”，喝了后通常有种甘甜的回味。福建的武夷岩茶、安溪铁观音、建甄水仙等都是。
    花茶：它是将绿茶加上茉莉、玉兰等鲜花而成。冲泡后花香四溢，而且茶叶甘甜，饮后口中余香久久不散。
    紧压茶（砖茶）：它是把醱酵茶压制成各种块状，像块砖似的。砖茶的色深味浓，又耐泡又好带，是兄弟民族不可缺少的必需品。云南的沱茶就是其中的一种。
    此外还有一些特种名贵茶，如龙井、碧螺春、毛峰等，都是以制工精巧、香味清高而驰名于国内外。
    一般说来，红茶含茶素较多，味道较浓，所以疲倦时喝杯红茶更易于提神。绿茶含单宁和维生素丙较多，茶色澄碧，清凉可口。乌龙茶兼有红绿茶的特点，闽粤及南洋华侨喜欢喝乌龙茶的人很多。花茶以它独到的香气吸引着许多人，北方人大都爱喝花茶。至于茶砖因易于溶解脂肪，所以特别受到边疆兄弟民族的欢迎。
