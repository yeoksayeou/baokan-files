The experience in governing the Mang River blossoms everywhere.
Henan, Shandong, and other provinces actively undertake governance planning for small and medium-sized river basins.

(Our newspaper reports) Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hebei and other provinces are learning from the experience of governing the Mang River, adopting the principle of "emphasizing water storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community-run initiatives," to fundamentally address the water hazards of medium and small rivers, and to comprehensively develop and utilize river water resources from tributaries to main streams and from upstream to downstream.

The Sha Ying River (in Henan), the largest tributary of the Huai River's upper reaches, is one of the first rivers to draw from the Mang River experience for fundamental governance. The plan for governing the Sha Ying River calls for soil and water conservation measures such as afforestation and terracing in the upper reaches, as well as the construction of gully dams and reservoir networks to intercept rainwater layer by layer. At the same time, cascade slow-flow dams will be built on tributaries to slow the speed of floodwaters, combined with diverting water to irrigate land along the banks, in order to achieve mountain water conservancy. In the plains, ditch and canal networks, as well as water storage projects such as dams, weirs, pits, and ponds will be built to divide rainwater, combined with well-digging to develop irrigation. In low-lying, flood-prone areas, small-scale flood storage reservoirs will be built to store water for irrigation, and a large number of water-tolerant crops such as paddy rice and upland rice will be planted. At the same time, the stored-water depressions will be used to grow aquatic products such as lotus roots and reeds. According to this plan, within three to five years, it will be possible to basically control soil erosion in mountainous and hilly areas, eliminate ordinary waterlogging, drought, and flood disasters, achieve water conservancy throughout the basin, and basically transform low-lying alkaline land. At present, the work of governing the Sha Ying River is in full swing. The Laiyang and Changwei areas of Shandong Province, also drawing on the experience of governing the Mang River, combined with their existing experience in water conservancy and soil and water conservation, have drafted a preliminary plan to fundamentally control the Dagu River, which flows across eight counties including Pingdu and Zhaoyuan. The plan calls for the construction of ten thousand ponds, dams, and reservoirs in the upper reaches, and a large amount of soil and water conservation work. In the middle and lower reaches, in the plains and low-lying areas, raised fields, embankments, platform fields, and water storage projects will be built to develop irrigation, transform dry land into irrigated land, and convert waterlogged lowlands into paddy fields. Efforts will be made to achieve water conservancy in the plains within three years (irrigation area accounting for more than 70% of cultivated land) and water conservancy in the mountainous and hilly areas within five years. At the same time, the Changwei area is also conducting basin planning for six major river systems including the Wei River, Jiao Lai River, Bailang River, Er River, Zi River, and Chao River, requiring a basic change in the rivers' appearance within three years. In order to realize the plan to fundamentally control the Yi River and Shu River in the next five years, the Linyi area sent a delegation of 72 county and district officials, led by the deputy commissioner, to Henan to visit and learn from the experience of governing the Mang River, and invited 14 experienced farmers to serve as technical instructors for river management in various counties. At present, the Party Committee and Commissioner's Office are responsible for the planning of six rivers, including the Yi River, Shu River, Wen River, and Lu Ju River, in separate areas.

Shanxi Province has organized large groups of cadres and masses to visit the Mang River basin in Henan Province twice, and is preparing to start the work of fundamentally controlling small rivers such as the Yu Shui River, Xiao River, Zhang River, Hutuo River, Yangwu River, Hun River, and Baideng River. At present, the planning committees and offices of these rivers have been established and are carrying out planning. In the Yanbei area, the commissioner has taken the lead in establishing the Hun River Management Committee to begin fundamentally controlling the Hun River as a prelude to promoting the Mang River experience throughout the area. In recent years, this area has widely promoted the management experience of Daquan Mountain, and hundreds and thousands of mountain peaks and tens of thousands of gullies have been managed.

After learning from the experience of governing the Mang River, Zhejiang Province, led by the deputy director of the Water Conservancy Department, conducted a basin plan for the Dongyang River, which has yielded experience and is prepared to be promoted on other rivers. Hebei Province has also been learning and promoting the experience of governing the Mang River since the beginning of the year, and is determined to carry out basin planning for special, county, township, and small and medium rivers.

    治理漭河经验四处开花
    河南山东等省积极进行中小河流域治理规划
    本报讯　河南、山东、山西、浙江、河北等省，正在学习治理漭河的经验，采取“以蓄水为主、小型工程为主、社办为主”的方针，根本治理中、小河流的水害，并从支流到主流、从上游到下游，全面开发综合利用河流水源。
    淮河上游最大的支流沙颍河
  （在河南部分），是较早吸取漭河经验进行根本治理的一条河流。治理沙颍河的规划确定在上游进行造林、修梯田等水土保持措施，并修建谷坊群、水库网，层层拦蓄雨水，同时在支流上修筑梯级缓流坝，减缓洪水流速度，结合引水灌溉沿岸土地，实现山地水利化。在平原地区兴修沟洫网及坝、堰、坑、塘等蓄水工程，分割雨水，并结合打井发展灌溉。在低洼易涝地区，修建小型蓄洪水库，蓄水灌溉，大量种植水稻、旱稻等耐水作物，同时利用蓄水洼地，种植莲藕、蒲苇等水产。按照这个规划，在三、五年内，就可以基本上做到控制山区丘陵的水土流失，消灭普通的水、旱、涝灾，达到全流域的水利化，洼地碱地基本改造完成。目前，治理沙颍河的工作正在紧张进行中。山东省莱阳、昌潍两专区也参照治理漭河的经验，结合本地区原有兴修水利和水土保持经验，拟定了根治流跨平度、招远等八县的大沽河的初步规划。确定在上游修建塘、坝、水库万座，大量进行水土保持；在中、下游平原洼涝地带，兴修畦田、围堤、台田及蓄水工程，发展灌溉，变旱地为水浇地，改涝洼地为水稻田。争取在三年内平原地区实现水利化（灌溉面积占耕地70％以上），五年内山地丘陵区实现水利化。与此同时，昌潍专区还进行潍河、胶莱河、白浪河、洱河、淄河、潮河等六条主要河系的流域规划，要求在三年内基本改变河流面貌。临沂专区为了实现今后五年根治沂沭河的计划，由副专员率领县、区负责干部七十二人，到河南参观学习漭河治理的经验，并约请有经验的农民十四人到各县担任治河的技术指导工作。目前已由地委、专署负责同志分片包干进行沂河、沭河、汶河、潞泇河等六条河流的规划。
    山西省已前后两次组织大批干部群众到河南省漭河流域参观，并准备开始根治洓水河、肖河、漳河、滹沱河、阳武河、浑河、白登河等小河流的工作。目前，这些河流的规划委员会和办公室都已成立，正在进行规划。在雁北专区，已由专员挂帅成立了治理浑河委员会，着手根治浑河，作为全区推广漭河经验的先声。这个专区几年来由于普遍推广了大泉山的治理经验，已有成百成千座山头和成千上万道沟壑得到治理。
    浙江省学习治理漭河的经验后，由水利厅副厅长率领规划队，进行了东阳江的流域规划，已取得经验，准备在其他河流上推广。河北省也自年前起学习推广治理漭河的经验，决心把专、县、乡和中小河流的流域规划搞起来。
