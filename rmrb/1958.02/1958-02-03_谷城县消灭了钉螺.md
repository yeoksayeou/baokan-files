　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Gucheng County, Hubei Province, one of the schistosomiasis endemic areas, actively carried out mass schistosomiasis prevention and control work, and basically eliminated snails within its territory last year.
　　The county's large-scale campaign to eliminate snails began in the spring of 1956 and basically eliminated snails by the spring of 1957.
　　Under the unified arrangement of the water conservancy and snail eradication headquarters, the county's snail eradication activities ensured that "water conservancy and snail eradication do not interfere with each other." The masses used the method of opening new ditches and burying old ditches to eradicate snails, which not only eradicated 90% of the snails but also expanded the irrigation area, enabling more than 2,800 mu of bad fields that "relied on the sky for rain" to achieve a bumper harvest.
　　Recently, the farmers of Gucheng County, combined with winter production, conducted a re-examination and thoroughly eliminated the remaining snails.

　　谷城县消灭了钉螺
    据新华社讯　血吸虫病疫区之一的湖北省谷城县，积极开展群众性的血吸虫病防治工作，在去年基本消灭了境内的钉螺。
    这个县大规模消灭钉螺的斗争是从1956年春天开始的，到1957年春天基本消灭了钉螺。
    这个县的灭螺活动在水利、灭螺指挥部的统一布置下，作到了“水利灭螺两不误”。群众运用开新沟埋旧沟的办法来进行灭螺，不仅使90％的钉螺被扑灭掉，又扩大了灌溉面积，使二千八百多亩“望天收”的坏田获得了丰收。
    最近，谷城县的农民又结合冬季生产进行了复查，彻底消灭了残存的钉螺。
