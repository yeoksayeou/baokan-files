　　The Northwest Russian Language Institute is like a garden. On both sides of the gate, a neat green hedge is formed by many small pine trees and holly bushes. This is the school's wall. Inside the wall, countless trees of all sizes are planted, including apple trees, pear trees, peach trees, and apricot trees, as well as Chinese parasol trees, poplars, pines, cypresses, and willows. Next to some of the trees and in the open spaces, patches of plump Chinese cabbages and green radishes are planted, making the scene particularly quiet and beautiful.
　　It is quite common for universities to plant trees to beautify the campus, but what is valuable here is that the trees were not purchased at great expense, but were cultivated by the faculty, staff, and students themselves.
　　This school was established in 1952. At that time, many open spaces in the school were overgrown with weeds, which were unsightly and unhygienic. Not long after the school started, Principal Wang Yunfeng and some veteran cadres who had undergone arduous revolutionary training were transferred to work at the school. They brought to the school the spirit of hard work and frugality in running schools, which they had learned in old liberated areas such as Yan'an. After arriving at the school, they mobilized all the teachers, students, and staff to start reclaiming the wasteland on the campus, planting various seedlings, vegetables, wheat, and beans on the newly reclaimed land. At that time, because everyone did not understand the techniques of cultivating trees and planting vegetables, they hired two workers to regularly cultivate the seedlings and cultivate the fields. However, the vegetables, crops, and tens of thousands of seedlings on more than 20 mu of land were too much for one or two people to handle. Every planting, plowing, sowing, and harvesting season, all the teachers, students, and staff were mobilized for voluntary labor. The fruits of everyone's labor were very rich. Now, the school has more than 50,000 trees of various kinds. The nursery they cultivated not only meets their own tree planting needs, but also supports brother schools in greening their campuses. The harvest of vegetables is also considerable. From 1954 to now, they have produced more than 303,000 jin of vegetables. In addition to a very small portion being sold to nearby schools, most of the vegetables are sold to student canteens and staff cafeterias at prices 20% lower than the market price. More than a quarter of the vegetables used by the school's cafeteria each year are produced on its own campus. These vegetables are fresh, cheap, and complete in variety. Therefore, although the students' food expenses are the same as those of other universities in Xi'an, the food is much better than in other schools. Since 1954, the school has also used vacant land to produce more than 8,000 jin of wheat, more than 9,800 jin of beans, and more than 1,500 jin of hemp and sunflower and other oil crops. Since 1953, the school has been using leftover food, dishwater, and rotten vegetable leaves to feed pigs. So far, they have fattened and slaughtered 246 fat pigs, and the pens are still raising 128 sows, piglets, and fat pigs. This has greatly reduced the amount of pork supplied to them by the state. Especially when the state's pork supply is most tight during the New Year and other festivals, they do not need the food company to supply even a single jin of pork. Even the problem of meat for family members is solved by raising pigs themselves.
　　Although the teachers, students, and staff of Northwest Russian Language Institute have participated in many voluntary labor activities on campus in the past, they were only carried out when the school needed them for production, and there was no system of physical labor. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call for intellectuals to train themselves through physical labor, everyone has further realized the importance of participating in physical labor. Many people have suggested that participation in physical labor should be regularized and a system should be established. Based on everyone's opinions, the trade union has decided that faculty and staff should participate in physical labor for half an hour every day. Since the beginning of this semester, a wave of enthusiasm for participating in physical labor has formed in the school. During leisure time every day, many faculty and staff can be seen working, some carrying soil in large baskets, some digging the ground, some moving bricks, and some repairing trees. The principal, the party committee secretary, and other main leading cadres of the school took the lead in participating in physical labor, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in labor. Therefore, except for a few faculty and staff members who are sick or too old, most of them have voluntarily signed up to participate in labor. Professors Sun Xiandong and Ai Zigao, who are over 50 years old, were persuaded by others to rest, but they still insisted on getting up every morning to participate in half an hour of labor. In this short period of more than two months, the faculty and staff have moved more than 30,000 adobe bricks to help repair the wall of the family dormitory, leveled about one mu of low-lying land with the large amount of loess dug out from the heating ditch, and prepared to plant vegetables next year. They also used the soil to build a rockery for the school's kindergarten. The cadres of the general affairs department renovated the school's trees during voluntary labor, and the cut branches were dried to make good firewood. They calculated that the school would not need to buy firewood for heating this winter, and may even have some left over to sell to the families of employees for heating. At present, the faculty and staff are reclaiming a large piece of land where bricks, tiles, and lime were piled up during basic construction in the past, preparing to remove the top layer of soil in order to sow grain and vegetables next spring.
　　The students' enthusiasm for labor is even higher. They said that the principal and teachers, who have experienced many years of arduous revolutionary environment training, still insist on participating in physical labor, and the old professors are so old that they are also actively training their ideological consciousness through labor. We are so young and have not been trained in a harsh environment, so we should transform our non-working-class ideological consciousness by participating in physical labor. In order to turn physical labor into a regular system, the students put forward many opinions and suggestions through big-character posters and League branch meetings. The students in each class proposed that they should wash their own clothes and quilts in the future, and the female students volunteered to sew quilts for the male students. Some students suggested through big-character posters to streamline the school's odd-job workers and let students be responsible for cleaning the environment and cleaning the pigsty; some students also proposed to completely divide the vegetable garden and wheat field to the students for their own cultivation, and many students also suggested establishing regular contact with factories and agricultural cooperatives. Now the school's Youth League Committee and the Student Union are formulating specific plans for students to participate in physical labor based on everyone's opinions.
　　Before the plan was formulated, the students had already taken active actions. Not long after the school started, they started pulling grass from the stadium and leveling their own stadium. They also built two three-meter-wide roads with cinder on the campus, and these two roads were more than 200 meters long. When building the road, some people broke their hands while smashing stones, some people rubbed blisters on their hands while digging soil, and some people rubbed their shoulders swollen while carrying soil, but no one complained. Everyone worked vigorously after school every afternoon. While building the road, the students also opened up more than two mu of land in front of the dormitory, made neat ridges, and planted spinach.
　　In addition to participating in school-wide physical labor, the students in some classes also formulated specific plans for their class to participate in labor. The students in Class 29 decided that in addition to washing their own clothes and participating in labor such as planting vegetables, they would also worship the cooks as teachers, help them cook, and learn cooking skills within two years. They divided all the students in the class into five groups, and every afternoon one group went to the cafeteria to help cut vegetables, knead dough, or wipe tables and wash dishes. Most of these students do not know how to cook, and some students do not even recognize whole green garlic sprouts. Some students wore white aprons for the first time to participate in labor and did not dare to go out of the kitchen to the dining hall to wipe the tables. Some students carried out a large pot of soup with the cooks and blushed with shame when they saw their classmates. Some students cut their hands while learning to cut vegetables and felt very embarrassed. However, when they saw that their classmates only had respect and encouragement for their labor, and there was no sarcasm at all, they realized that their shyness was entirely due to the influence of petty-bourgeois ideology. Now they are used to this kind of labor, and they not only do not feel ashamed, but also feel proud. In addition, the students in Class 30 have also begun the labor of cleaning toilets by division of labor.

    劳动的果实
    本报记者　李茜
    走进西北俄文专科学校简直像进了花园一样，大门两旁由许多小松树、冬青组成一道整整齐齐的绿篱，这就是学校的围墙，围墙里边种着数不清的大大小小的树木，其中有苹果树、梨树、桃树和杏树，也有梧桐、白杨、松柏和杨柳树，有些树木的旁边和空地上种着一片片肥硕的大白菜和青萝卜。显得特别幽静美丽。
    在高等学校里多种一些树木美化校园本来是很普通的事，可贵的是，这里的树木没有花费很多的钱采购，而是教职员工和学生们亲自动手培植起来的。
    这个学校是1952年建立的，那时，学校中很多空地上都长满了荒草，既不美观又有碍卫生。开学不久，王云风校长和一些曾经受过革命艰苦锻炼的老干部调到这个学校工作，他们把在延安等老解放区艰苦奋斗、勤俭办学的精神带到学校。他们到校后，就发动全校师生员工动手开垦校内荒地，在新开垦的荒地上栽种上各种树苗、蔬菜、小麦和豆类，当时因为大家不懂栽培树木和种植菜蔬的技术，就请了两个工人经常培育这些树苗和耕种田地，但是，二十多亩地的蔬菜、庄稼和成千上万株的树苗，一、两个人是忙不过来的。每到植树、翻地、播种和收获的季节，就发动全校师生员工义务劳动。大家劳动的果实是非常丰硕的，现在，这个学校已经有五万多株各种不同的树木。他们培养的苗圃不仅满足自己植树需要，而且还支援兄弟学校绿化校园。蔬菜的收获量也是很可观的。从1954年到现在，他们生产的蔬菜已达三十万三千多斤，这些菜除了很小部分卖给附近学校外，绝大部分都是以低于市价20％的价格卖给学生灶和教工食堂。这个学校的食堂每年用的蔬菜有四分之一以上都是自己校园生产的，这些菜既新鲜又便宜，种类也很齐全，因此，学生们的伙食费虽然和西安其他高等学校一样，伙食却比其他学校好得多。1954年以来，这个学校还利用空地生产了八千多斤小麦、九千八百多斤豆和一千五百多斤麻子、葵花等油料作物。这个学校从1953年起就利用学校的剩饭菜、刷锅水和烂菜叶等喂猪，到目前为止，他们已经喂肥宰杀了二百四十六头肥猪，圈内还养着一百二十八头母猪、小猪和肥猪，这就大大减少了国家对他们供应猪肉的数量，尤其是过年过节国家猪肉供应最紧张的时候，他们一斤猪肉都不要食品公司供应，连家属吃肉问题也靠自己养猪解决的。
    西北俄专的师生员工们过去虽然参加过校内很多次义务劳动，但究竟还是学校生产上需要时就搞一次，没有形成体力劳动的制度。自党中央提出知识分子通过参加体力劳动锻炼自己的号召以后，大家更进一步认识到参加体力劳动的重要意义，很多人建议把参加体力劳动经常化，并订出制度，工会根据大家的意见，确定教职员工每天半小时的时间参加体力劳动，从本学期开学以来，这个学校就形成了参加体力劳动的热潮。每天的课余时间，都可以看到很多教职员工在劳动，有的用大筐抬土，有的在挖地，有的在搬砖，也有的在修理树木。校长、党委书记和学校其他主要领导干部带头参加体力劳动，大大的鼓舞了群众参加劳动的热情。因此，除个别有病或年龄太大的教职员外，绝大部分都自动报名参加了劳动，五十多岁的孙现冬教授和艾子高教授虽然年纪大了，别人劝他们休息，但是他们还是坚持每天早晨起来参加半小时劳动。在这短短的两个多月的时间内，教工们就搬运了三万多块土坯帮助修好了眷属宿舍的围墙，将修暖气沟槽挖出的大量黄土垫平了约一亩大的一块洼地，准备明年种菜，还用这些土为学校幼儿园修了一座假山。总务处的干部们在义务劳动时把学校的树木进行了整修，把砍下来的树枝子晒干就是很好的柴。他们计算了一下，今年冬季全校生火不用买柴，还可能剩下来一部分卖给职工家属生火。目前，教职员工们正在开垦一大块过去在基本建设时堆放砖瓦石灰的土地，准备把表面一层土去掉，以便明年开春播种粮食和菜蔬。
    学生们的劳动热情更高，他们说，曾经经过多年艰苦革命环境锻炼的校长和先生们还坚持参加体力劳动，老教授们年纪那么大了也积极从劳动中锻炼自己的思想意识，我们这样年轻，又没有受过艰苦环境的锻炼，更应该从参加体力劳动中改造自己非工人阶级的思想意识了。为了把体力劳动变成经常的制度，学生们通过大字报和团支部大会提了很多意见和建议。各班同学都提议以后自己动手洗衣服洗被子，女同学还自告奋勇为男同学缝被子。有些同学通过大字报建议精简学校的杂工，由同学担任打扫环境卫生、清理猪舍等工作；还有的学生提议把菜园和麦地也完全分给学生自己耕种，也有不少同学建议同工厂和农业社建立经常联系，现在校团委和学生会正在根据大家的意见制订学生参加体力劳动的具体方案。
    在方案没有制订以前，同学们已经积极行动起来，他们在开学不久，就动手拔体育场的草，并平整了自己的体育场。他们还用灰碴在校内修了两条三公尺宽的路，这两条路长达二百多公尺。在修路时，有人砸石子打破了手，有人挖土时把手磨成泡，有人抬土把肩磨肿了，但是没有一个人叫苦，大家每天下午下课后就精神抖擞的劳动起来了。在修路的同时，学生们还在宿舍前面开出二亩多地，做成整齐的畦子，种上了菠菜。
    有些班的同学除了参加全校性的体力劳动外，还拟定了本班参加劳动的具体计划。二十九班的同学们决定除了自己洗衣服，参加种菜等劳动外，还拜炊事员为老师，帮助他们做饭，自己在两年的时间内学会做饭技术。他们把全班同学分成五个组，每天下午有一个组到食堂帮助切菜、揉面、或擦桌洗碗。这些同学绝大部分是不会做饭的，甚至有的同学连整棵的青蒜苗都不认识，有些同学第一次参加劳动戴上白围裙不敢走出厨房门到饭厅去擦桌子，有的和炊事员抬出一大盆汤来，看见同学就羞的红了脸，也有的同学学切菜把手切破了，感到很不好意思。但是，当他们看到同学们对自己的劳动只有尊敬和鼓励，而没有一点讽刺意思的时候，才意识到自己怕羞完全是小资产阶级思想在作怪。现在他们已经习惯了这种劳动，不但不感到羞，而且感到自豪了。另外，三十班的同学也开始了分工打扫厕所的劳动。
