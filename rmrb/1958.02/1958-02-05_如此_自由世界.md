    Such a "Free World"
    Beasts in Religious Clothing
    A shocking murder case of a priest killing a woman of good family recently occurred in France. This priest, named Dernols, preached in the French town of Youluffe. He seduced a 19-year-old girl named Rikin. After she became pregnant, the priest killed her with a pistol and also killed the fetus in her womb with a knife.
    After the incident, investigations proved that Dernols was a hypocrite, licentious and cruel. He had seduced married women and young girls more than once, and committed adultery with a widow with four children, defrauding the widow of 200,000 francs to buy a car.
    Although Dernols was considered to have "committed the most serious crime of a French priest," he was only sentenced to forced labor by the court, which aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the local public.
    A Suicidal Government Drives People to Suicide
    Clement was a perfume merchant in Paris, living in a luxurious apartment with his wife, Felicie. Not long ago, neighbors discovered that Felicie was not at home. Clement told them, "She went to Italy." Later, Clement also suddenly disappeared. A few days later, the landlord smelled a bad odor in his apartment and called the police to break in. They found that all the furniture in the house had been destroyed. Felicie was dead in the bathtub, and Clement was dead on the sofa with a bullet hole in his forehead. It turned out that Clement had first killed his wife, hid her in the bathtub, and then committed suicide. The police found a suicide note on the table, which read: "I don't want to leave anything to the government that is leading the country to destruction... I believe that it is better to end my life sooner than to endure suffering and slowly die in such a chaotic so-called democratic country."
    New York is a Haven for Juvenile Delinquents
    The February 7 issue of "U.S. News & World Report," published in advance, said that many schools in New York City have become terrifying areas where juvenile delinquents are rampant. The magazine listed a series of recent events, saying: "On January 21, a thirteen-year-old girl was raped in the basement of John Marshall Junior High School in Brooklyn; on January 23, a female teacher at Brooklyn's Junior High School 67 was threatened by a group of students with sticks, and they confined her to the classroom; on January 28, George Goldfarb, the principal of John Marshall Junior High School, committed suicide by jumping off a building; on the same night, a thirteen-year-old black girl was raped at Brooklyn Junior High School 20; on January 29, a rape case involving juveniles occurred near the school."
    According to police records, in 1957, there were 3,298 criminal cases in New York City public schools, 515 of which were more serious crimes.
    The Suffocating British Film Industry
    An article in the British "Daily Worker" stated that 70% to 80% of the films currently screened in the UK are American films, and the British film industry has been suffocating under Hollywood's influence for many years.
    The article pointed out that the new year will bring a new crisis to the British film industry, and this crisis will be deeper and more fundamental. Cold numbers show that the number of British film audiences is decreasing. In the last three months of last year, this number dropped by an astonishing astronomical figure of 25%, which is 60 million fewer visits than a year ago. This situation will be even worse this year.
    The article pointed out that although audiences indicate that they love to watch domestic films every year in film selections, British producers have not made any efforts to promote film production. The British film industry has been a servile colonial outpost of Hollywood for too long. In the past thirty years, the money earned by Hollywood has been enough to pay off a considerable portion of the national debt.

专栏：如此“自由世界”

　　如此“自由世界”
    披着宗教外衣的野兽
    法国最近发生了一椿神父杀害良家妇女的凶杀案件。这个名叫德诺尔斯的神父在法国的尤路菲镇传教，他诱奸了一个名叫丽金的十九岁的少女，在她怀孕后，神父用手枪把她杀死，并且用小刀把她腹中的胎儿也杀害了。
    案件发生后，经调查证明，德诺尔斯乃是一个荒淫残暴的伪君子。他曾不止一次地诱奸有夫之妇和少女，并同一个有四个孩子的寡妇通奸，骗取了这个寡妇二十万法郎，买了一辆汽车。
    德诺尔斯虽然被认为“犯了法国神父最严重的罪行”，但是却只被法庭判处劳役，因而引起当地公众普遍不满。
    自杀的政府逼人自杀
    克里门特是巴黎的一个香水商人，同他的妻子费莉茜住在豪华的公寓里。不久前，邻居发现费莉茜不在家了，克里门特告诉他们说：“她上意大利去了。”后来，克里门特也突然失踪了。几天后，房东发觉他的寓所有臭味，便找来警察破门而入。只见满屋家具尽已破坏，费莉茜死在浴缸里，克里门特死在沙发上，额上有一个子弹孔。原来克里门特先杀死了他的妻子，把她藏在浴缸内，然后自杀。警察在桌上发现一封遗书，上面写道：“我不愿留下任何东西给正在将国家引向毁灭的政府……。我相信，与其在这样混乱的所谓民主国家里忍受痛苦而慢慢死去，不如尽早结束生命”。
　　纽约是少年罪犯的巢穴
    预先出版的2月7日一期“美国新闻与世界报道”说，纽约市的好些学校已经成了少年犯罪分子猖獗活动的恐怖地区。杂志列举最近发生的一系列事件说：“1月21日，一个十三岁的女孩在布鲁克林的约翰马歇尔初级中学地下室被强奸；1月23日，布鲁克林第六十七中学的一名女教员遭到了一群拿着棍子的学生的威胁，她被他们禁闭在教室内；1月28日，约翰马歇尔初级中学校长乔治·高尔法跳楼自杀；同一天晚上，一个十三岁的黑人女孩在布鲁克林第二十中学被强奸；1月29日，在学校附近发生了牵连少年的强奸案。”
    据警察局的材料说，在1957年中，在纽约公立学校内发生了三千二百九十八起犯罪案，其中五百十五起是较重大的犯罪案。
    窒息中的英国电影业
    英国“工人日报”的一篇文章说，目前在英国放映的影片中有70％到80％是美国片子，多少年来英国电影事业一直在好莱坞的窒息下。
    文章指出，新的一年将给英国电影事业带来新的危机，而且这个危机将更深刻，更带根本性。冷酷的数字表明英国电影观众的人数越来越少了，去年最后三个月中，这个数字下降了25％的惊人天文数字，比一年前少了六千万人次。今年这个情况将要更糟。
    文章指出，虽然每年影片评选观众都表示爱看本国电影，英国的制片商们却没有作什么努力来促进制片工作。英国的电影工业在太长的时期内一直是好莱坞卑躬屈节的殖民前哨据点。过去三十年来，被好莱坞赚去的钱足以偿付相当大的一部分国债。
