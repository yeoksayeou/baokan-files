    Half-Month Agricultural Situation
    "Beginning of Spring" (February 4) – "Rain Water" (February 19)
    During the half-month between "Beginning of Spring" and "Rain Water," although several days fell within the Spring Festival period, agricultural activities in various regions did not decrease due to the holiday. Water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and fertilizer delivery were all important projects in the preparatory work for spring plowing in various places. Many regions seized the Spring Festival period to continue a concentrated effort on these tasks. On the day before the Spring Festival, the Shaoyang Special District of Hunan Province mobilized two million people and accumulated 40 million dan of fertilizer. In Lujiang, Feidong, and Shouxian counties of Anhui Province, many members of agricultural cooperatives worked as usual on Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year. In Lujiang County, more than 140,000 cooperative members participated in water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and field management of summer-ripening crops on the first day of the Lunar New Year.
    Many northern regions, like the south, broke with convention and celebrated the Spring Festival with labor. This fully reflects the revolutionary drive of the people in the great leap forward of socialist construction.
    In northern regions, early-maturing crops such as spring wheat and barley have begun to be sown during this period. Some areas in the North China Plain started earlier. Before the Spring Festival, Handan and Cangxian Special Districts in Hebei Province had already sown 1.2 to 1.3 million mu of early-maturing crops such as spring wheat. Under the slogan "Bid farewell to the old year by watering the land, and welcome the new spring by sowing seeds," the broad masses of cooperative members in Cangxian Special District mostly achieved the goal of: Finishing sowing on the 29th, and starting again on the morning of the first day.
    In northeastern northern areas and eastern Inner Mongolia, spring wheat sowing can only be carried out after the thaw. Agricultural cooperatives in spring wheat areas in Gansu and Qinghai provinces are preparing for the specific work of sowing, which generally begins after "Awakening of Insects."
    Most rice-growing areas in the south have begun activities such as preparing nursery fields and soaking seeds. Some areas have already put rice seeds into the fields.
    The seedling work in the southern flue-cured tobacco planting areas generally also begins during this period. Around "Beginning of Spring," the Zunyi Special District of Guizhou has sown more than 66,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco, accounting for more than one-third of the sowing plan. The Zunyi Special District of Guizhou Province started sowing flue-cured tobacco about half a month earlier this year than in the past.

    半月农情
    “立春”（2月4日）——“雨水”（2月19日）
    “立春”到“雨水”之间的半个月里虽然有几天处于春节阶段，但是各地的农事活动并没有因为过节而减少。修水利、积肥、送粪等都是各地备耕工作当中的重要项目，许多地区都抓住了春节期间继续突击这些事情。春节前一天，湖南邵阳专区出动二百万人，积肥四千万担。安徽省庐江、肥东、寿县的许多农业社的社员，在农历新年的除夕和正月初一照常出勤。庐江县在初一这一天就有十四万多社员参加修水利、积肥和对夏熟作物进行田间管理等工作。
    北方许多地区也和南方一样，打破了常规，在劳动中欢度春节。这充分反映了人们在社会主义建设大跃进中的革命干劲。
    北方地区的春小麦、大麦等早熟作物，已在这个时期开始播种。华北平原的一些地区动手较早，河北省邯郸、沧县两个专区已在春节前播下春麦等早熟作物一百二、三十万亩。沧县专区广大社员在“浇地辞旧岁，播种迎新春”的口号鼓舞下，大部分做到：播种干到二十九，初一早上又动手。
    东北北部和内蒙古东部等地区，要在开冻以后才能进行春麦播种。甘肃、青海等省春麦区的农业社正在准备播种的具体工作，一般在“惊蛰”后开始播种。
    南方大部水稻区都开始了整理秧田、浸种等活动。有些地区已把稻种下到田里。
    南方烤烟种植区的育苗工作一般也在这个时期动手。贵州遵义专区在“立春”前后已播种烤烟六万六千多亩，占播种计划的三分之一多。贵州遵义专区今年烤烟播种比过去早半个月左右。
