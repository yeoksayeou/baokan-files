Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The first batch of conscripted soldiers from the People's Liberation Army Land Forces, having completed their three-year service, are now successively bidding farewell to the troops, retiring and returning to the production front, and are being incorporated into the reserve force according to the law.

This batch of conscripted soldiers was recruited to supplement the People's Liberation Army in accordance with the principles of the conscription system, based on the State Council's decision in November 1954 before the promulgation of China's Military Service Law.

Before leaving the troops, each unit universally held farewell meetings. Unit leaders and comrades encouraged them to continue to maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army after returning to their hometowns, actively participate in agricultural production, exemplarily abide by government laws and decrees, and participate in reserve training on time, striving for new glory on the agricultural production front. When they set off to return home, each unit was led by unit leaders with officers and soldier representatives, drumming and gonging to send them off to the station. To ensure the smooth journey of the retiring conscripted soldiers, each unit also dispatched advance teams to coordinate with relevant local departments in setting up food and transportation stations at appropriate locations along the way, and also transferred some officers to send them back to their place of origin.

On the eve of their departure, the retiring conscripted soldiers, with reluctance, exchanged souvenirs such as photos and diaries with their comrades who remained in the troops, and signed and wrote inscriptions on each other's diaries. Many also made competition agreements, agreeing to strive for new achievements in their respective posts. Many units of retiring conscripted soldiers, with a spirit of responsibility to the end, launched activities to ensure "doing the last thing well" before leaving the team, "standing the last shift well," and "performing the last mission well." They also passed on their experience and technology to the new comrades who took over. When handing over the weapons they used, they wiped the weapons clean, and many also wrote parting poems on the guns. A soldier of a certain unit, Chen Jinliang, wrote: "I picked up my beloved gun and wiped it brightly under the moonlight. I am leaving tomorrow to build a beautiful farm. May the comrade who accepts this gun have excellent shooting results and a strong determination to defend the motherland." Wei Haisi, a Yi ethnic minority soldier who had received four awards, ran to the artillery piece to bid farewell to it when he left the company, saying, "Once the country needs me, I will fly from my hometown of Guizhou back to you like a bird." The retiring conscripted soldiers also stated at many farewell meetings that they would go all out like they did in the army and make new achievements on the production front, striving to be model workers.

Over the past three years, under the leadership of the Party, and with the education and help of commanders and veteran soldiers at all levels of the troops, these conscripted soldiers not only successfully carried out combat duties such as border defense, coastal defense, air defense, and internal security, but also successfully completed the formal military training and political and cultural learning plans. Many conscripted soldiers also excellently completed arduous tasks such as building barracks, defense projects, and railway projects. In performing these tasks and strict formal training, they significantly improved their political awareness and cultural level, mastered certain military techniques and military knowledge, and strengthened their organization and discipline. Many of them have become grassroots backbones of the troops in implementing various tasks, won the glorious title of excellent shooter and technical expert, and have been accepted as members of the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League. For example, among the retiring conscripted soldiers of the Nanjing troops, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for 90%; those who have won the title of excellent shooter and technical expert account for 60%. After their retirement, they will play an important role in strengthening militia organizations and reserve construction, and in strengthening socialist economic construction.

According to Article 10 of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China, some of the sergeants in this batch of conscripted soldiers, although they have completed their active service period, still remain in the troops to serve beyond their term of service according to the needs of the army and their own wishes. The sergeants who have been approved to serve beyond their term of service all believe that this is a great honor, and they are determined to stick to their combat posts and continue to defend national defense and the socialist construction of the motherland.

    学好了保卫祖国的本领　返回到建设祖国的岗位
    首批义务兵服役期满退伍还乡
    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军陆军部队的第一批义务兵，服役三年已经期满，现正陆续告别部队，退伍回到生产战线，并依法编入预备役。
    这批义务兵是我国兵役法颁布前根据1954年11月国务院决定，按义务兵制原则试行征集补充人民解放军的兵员。
    退伍义务兵在离开部队前，各部队普遍地举行了欢送大会，部队首长和战友们都勉励他们回乡后继续保持和发扬人民解放军的优良传统，积极参加农业生产，模范地遵守政府法令，按时参加预备役训练，在农业生产战线上争取新的光荣。在启程还乡的时候，各部队都由部队首长率领军官和士兵代表，敲锣打鼓地把他们欢送到车站。为了使退伍义务兵归途中顺利，各部队还派出了先遣队，协同地方有关部门在沿途适当地点设立了饮食站和交通站，并抽调了一部分军官，送他们返回原籍。
    在离队前夕，退伍义务兵们怀着恋恋不舍的心情，和留队的战友们互相赠送了像片、日记本等纪念品，并在日记本上互相签名、题辞留念。很多人还互订了竞赛条件，相约在各自的岗位上争取新的成绩。很多部队的退伍义务兵都以负责到底的精神，展开了保证在离队前“作好最后一件事”，“站好最后一班岗”、“执行好最后一次勤务”的活动。他们还把自己的经验和技术传授给接班的新战友。在移交自己使用的武器时，他们都把武器擦拭得干干净净，许多人还在枪炮上写下了惜别的诗句。某部士兵陈金良写道：“我拿起心爱的枪，月光下把它擦亮。明天我就要走了，去建设美丽的农庄。愿接受这支枪的同志，射击成绩优秀，保卫祖国的决心坚强。”受过四次奖励的彝族战士韦海思，在离开连队的时候，特地跑到大炮跟前向炮告别，他说：“国家一旦需要我，我会像鸟儿一样，从家乡贵州再飞到你的跟前。”退伍义务兵们还在许多欢送大会上表示：回乡后一定像在部队里一样鼓足干劲，在生产战线上做出新的成绩，争取做劳动模范。
    三年来，这批义务兵在党的领导下，在部队各级指挥员和老战士的教育、帮助下，他们不但胜利地执行了边防、海防、空防和内卫等战斗勤务，而且圆满地完成了正规军事训练和政治、文化学习计划。许多义务兵还出色地完成了修建营房、国防工程和铁路工程等艰巨任务。在执行这些任务和严格的正规训练中，他们都显著地提高了政治觉悟和文化水平，掌握了一定的军事技术和军事知识，并且加强了组织性和纪律性。其中许多人都已成为部队贯彻执行各种任务的基层骨干，获得了优等射手和技术能手的光荣称号，并被接收为共产党员或共青团员。如南京部队退伍的义务兵中，共产党员和共青团员占90％；获得优等射手和技术能手称号的占60％。他们退伍以后，对于加强民兵组织和预备役建设，对于加强社会主义经济建设，都将发挥重要作用。
    根据中华人民共和国兵役法第十条的规定，这批义务兵中有一部分军士，虽然服现役期已满，但根据军队的需要和他们本人的自愿，仍然留在部队超期服现役。被批准超期服现役的军士们，都认为这是极大的光荣，他们决心坚守在自己的战斗岗位上，继续保卫国防、保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
