　　Prime Minister Nehru Says
    Only One Way to End the Cold War: Adopt the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 4th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a mass meeting in Bombay on the 3rd that there is only one way to end the "Cold War," and that is to adopt the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    He said, "We are absolutely convinced today that there is no other way for the world to go but to accept these principles."
    In his speech, he reiterated that India's foreign policy is guided by the "Panchsheel" (Five Principles).
    He also said that some Baghdad Pact countries' recent request at the Baghdad Pact Ankara meeting to obtain atomic weapons was a "horrifying and stupid request."

　　尼赫鲁总理说
    结束冷战只有一个办法  采取和平共处五项原则
    新华社新德里4日电　印度总理尼赫鲁3日在孟买的一个群众大会上说，结束“冷战”只有一个办法，那就是采取和平共处五项原则。
    他说，“我们今天绝对相信，世界除接受这种原则之外，别无其他出路”。
    他在演说中重申印度的外交政策以“潘查希拉”（五项原则）为指导原则。
    他还说，某些巴格达条约国家在最近巴格达条约安卡拉会议上要求得到原子武器，这是一种“骇人听闻的要求和愚蠢的要求”。
    尼赫鲁希望在亚洲放置原子弹和氢弹的事永远不会发生。尼赫鲁还抨击在北大西洋公约国家内配置导弹的建议。
