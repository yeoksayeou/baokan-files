Notes

    "Uncompensated Aid"
    Recently, the United States Information Service in Phnom Penh has very generously provided free screenings of many films to local residents, even supplying the projectors for free.
    It turns out that these films are all propaganda for the so-called "American way of life," mainly depicting obscene and murderous events. After many young people in Phnom Penh watched them, many cases of rape, murder, and theft occurred.
    This is probably the "uncompensated aid" that the United States has always boasted of providing to underdeveloped countries!

    “无偿援助”
    最近，金边的美国新闻处非常慷慨地给当地居民免费放映了许多影片，甚至连放映机也免费供应。
    原来这些影片都是宣传所谓“美国生活方式”，以描写淫秽、凶杀事件为主要内容的。金边许多青少年看了以后，发生了不少奸淫、凶杀和盗窃的案件。
    这大概就是美国一向吹嘘的对不发达国家提供的“无偿援助”吧！
