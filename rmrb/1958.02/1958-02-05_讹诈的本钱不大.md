    Little Capital for Blackmail
    After a small American satellite went into space, American news agencies announced that the United States' rigid attitude towards a summit meeting would be altered due to the successful launch of the satellite. If this were the case, then peace-loving people of all nations would be nodding in approval.
    However, this propaganda actually leaks such information, as if the United States believes that launching a satellite has greatly strengthened its "position of strength" in international negotiations. In other words, the United States intends to regard its small satellite as capital for political blackmail. If this is the case, the ruling groups in the United States have miscalculated. It should be known that, even as a bargaining chip in negotiations, a thirteen-kilogram satellite is very light.

    讹诈的本钱不大
    在美国的一颗小小的人造卫星上了天以后，美国通讯社宣传说，美国对最高级会议的僵硬态度将会因为发射人造卫星成功而有所改变。如果事情真是这样，那末，各国爱好和平的人民是要额首称庆的。
    但是这种宣传实际上是透露这样一种风声，仿佛美国认为因为发射了一颗人造卫星而大大加强了它在国际谈判中的“实力地位”。换句话说，美国打算把它那颗小卫星看作是进行政治讹诈的本钱。如果事情是这样的话，美国的统治集团就未免打错算盘了。须知，就是作为谈判上的砝码，十三公斤的小卫星也是分量很轻的。
