Representative Song Mou said: The people of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan have been eagerly demanding reform for several years, and their wishes have turned into actions, forming a revolutionary momentum among the masses. The vast majority of clerical and secular leaders in the prefecture have seen the wishes and strength of the masses and agreed to the reform. Last spring, the first batch of peaceful consultation land reform was completed; now, the last batch of more than 50,000 Tibetan and Yi people's settlements are undergoing pilot reform work; at the same time, the collectivization movement is steadily progressing in the reformed areas. Now, an overwhelming revolutionary torrent has formed in the autonomous prefecture, and no force can stop it.

The state's first Five-Year Plan has been successfully overfulfilled. Now, the people of all ethnic groups across the country are entering the first year of the second Five-Year Plan with a hundredfold confidence, launching a production upsurge in all aspects, with the agricultural leap forward as the main focus. These grand revolutionary movements, as well as the magnificent call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, and the publication and promotion of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, have greatly encouraged the people of all ethnic groups in our Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, and greatly promoted our work in various aspects.

The Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has more than 100,000 Tibetan, Naxi, Han, Lisu, Yi, and other ethnic groups, with a vast area and abundant resources. The prefecture has more than one million mu of cultivated land and hundreds of thousands of mu of arable wasteland. From river valleys more than 1,000 meters above sea level to plateaus 3,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level, it is suitable for planting various crops such as rice, corn, highland barley, buckwheat, and potatoes; there are 65,000 yaks, hybrids of yak and cattle, and yellow cattle, 23,000 horses, mules, and donkeys, 160,000 goats and sheep, more than 100,000 pigs, and hundreds of miles of grassland pastures, which can develop animal husbandry; the prefecture also has large areas of dense forests, rich mineral deposits, and many precious specialties such as cordyceps, fritillaria, deer antlers, and musk. Just like other regions of the motherland, the natural potential for developing the national economy is enormous. However, because the prefecture has not yet fully completed social reform, except for the first, second, and third districts of Weixi County, which have achieved collectivization, areas with a population of more than 50,000 have just completed land reform last spring, and areas with a population of more than 50,000 are still under the shackles of the feudal system. Therefore, various productions have not been developed as they should be, and people's lives have not been significantly improved.

Only through social reform can we develop the national economy, improve people's lives, and make society progress and the nation prosper. This can be understood not only in principle, but also with many vivid practical examples: the rapid progress in production in the inland areas, neighboring prefectures and counties, and collectivized areas within the prefecture in recent years, as well as the overfulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan, have been witnessed and heard by all. Taking the agricultural leap forward in the prefecture as an example, it is enough to educate us: the agricultural production upsurge in the collectivized first, second, and third districts of Weixi County is as hot as in the inland areas. Even in the Jinjiang District of Zhongdian County, which completed land reform only last spring, because it has been liberated from the feudal system and guided by the collectivization movement, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has been unprecedentedly high. In the area with a population of more than 20,000, 5,000 to 6,000 people are participating in water conservancy construction. They want to dig through mountains and rocks to build 30 to 40 water conservancy projects, including a large canal 60 kilometers long, benefiting more than 24,000 mu of land, and expanding rice fields by 10,000 mu; another 3,000 to 4,000 people are accumulating fertilizer, building pigsties and toilets everywhere, and searching for natural fertilizer all over the mountains, planning to increase fertilizer by more than 50%. In addition to wheat processing and other farm work, the attendance rate has reached more than 90%. There are no idlers in the village, and the winter slack season has become a busy winter! However, in the Dazhongdian Dam in the same county, there are fertile hundreds of thousands of mu of flat cultivated land. As long as some drainage projects are built, the crop yield can be greatly increased. There are also tens of thousands of livestock. As long as some livestock pens are built, the amount of fertilizer can be increased several times. However, because the feudal system has not yet been abolished, the farmers' production base is very weak, and their enthusiasm is not high enough, so a production upsurge has not been launched. However, people's hearts are always moving forward. The prosperous scene in the collectivized areas and reformed areas within the prefecture, especially in the advanced areas of the country, is like the sunshine shining on the earth, illuminating the path of the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture. The masses of people complain about the delay in carrying out reform. They yearn for the socialist road to prosperity and want to get rid of the shackles of the feudal system. For several years, they have been eagerly demanding reform, and their wishes have turned into actions, forming a revolutionary momentum among the masses. The vast majority of clerical and secular leaders in the prefecture have recognized the future of the nation and the individual, and seen the wishes and strength of the masses, and therefore agreed to the reform. Many public leaders have participated in the reform work with a positive and supportive attitude. Therefore, in the winter before last year, after full preparation, and based on the spirit of the central government and the characteristics of the region, a land reform plan for peaceful consultation was formulated and pilot reforms were carried out. By last spring, under the correct leadership of the Party, the first batch of reforms was completed. Because the policies were conscientiously implemented, the masses were mobilized, the upper strata were united, and freedom of religious belief was protected, the masses in the areas that had not yet been reformed were greatly encouraged, and the upper strata were stabilized and educated. Now, the pilot reform of the last batch of more than 50,000 Tibetan and Yi people's settlements is underway. We are prepared to finally complete the peaceful consultation land reform in the second quarter of this year, and at the same time actively and steadily carry out the collectivization movement in the reformed areas. In these tasks, as the governor of the autonomous prefecture and a representative figure in the religious circles, the Living Buddha of Zhongdian Great Temple, I should play a leading role from the wishes of the people and the fundamental interests of the nation. Now I have made up my mind to abandon exploitation and serve the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture with peace of mind.

Socialism is the common goal of all ethnic groups, and social reform is the inevitable path to socialism. Completing the last batch of peaceful consultation land reform in our autonomous prefecture, as well as actively and steadily carrying out the collectivization movement in the reformed areas, is already a matter of course that cannot be delayed any longer. The democratic revolution and the socialist revolution are the urgent demands of the masses and the fundamental interests of the nation. Now, an overwhelming revolutionary torrent has formed in the prefecture, and no force can stop it. However, there are still a few people who do not understand the greater good, and for the interests of the exploiting class, they attempt to resist reform. That is a betrayal of the national interests and a violation of the people's will, and will be shattered by the revolutionary torrent and spurned by the masses of people! The democratic revolution that is currently underway and the socialist revolution that is coming next are bound to win a complete victory. We are determined, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the state, to conscientiously implement the policies, mobilize the masses, unite the upper strata, complete various social reforms, carry out rectification and socialist education, overcome local nationalism, inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, accelerate our pace, catch up with the advanced, and strive to vigorously develop our agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and other industrial and mining enterprises in the second Five-Year Plan, together with the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and strive for a comprehensive surge in economic construction, so as to fundamentally change our poor and backward situation!

Finally, I sincerely wish the conference success and the country prosperity.

    社会改革是通往社会主义必由之路
    松谋代表说：云南迪庆藏族自治州人民群众，几年来一直迫不及待地要求改革，而且心愿变成了行动，形成了群众的革命声势。全州僧俗头人绝大部分看见群众的愿望和力量，同意改革。去年春完成第一批和平协商土地改革；现在最后一批五万多人口藏、彝族聚居区正进行改革试点工作；同时在已改革的地区稳步进行合作化运动。现在自治州里已经形成压倒一切的革命洪流，任何力量也阻挡不了它。
    国家第一个五年计划胜利地超额完成了。现在全国各族人民，正以百倍信心跨入第二个五年计划的第一个年头，掀起了以农业大跃进为主的各个方面的生产高潮，这些浩大的革命声势，以及十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的宏伟号召和全国农业发展纲要修正草案的公布与宣传，大大鼓舞了我们云南省迪庆藏族自治州各族人民，大大促进了我们各个方面的工作。
    迪庆藏族自治州有十多万藏、纳西、汉、傈僳、彝等各族人民，地区辽阔，资源丰富，全州有百余万亩耕地和数十万亩可耕荒地，从拔海一千多公尺的河谷地带到拔海三、四千公尺的高原，适宜于稻谷、玉米、青稞、荞子、洋芋等多种作物的种植；有毛牛、犏牛、黄牛共六万五千头，马、骡、驴共二万三千匹，山羊、绵羊共十六万只，猪十多万口和连绵数百里草原牧场，可以发展畜牧；州内还有大片茂密的森林、丰富的矿藏、以及虫草、贝母、鹿葺、麝香等许多珍贵特产。正如祖国其他地区一样，发展国民经济的自然潜力是巨大的，只因为到目前为止，州内还没有全部完成社会改革，除去维西县第一二三区已实现合作化外，有五万多人口的地区刚于去年春季完成土地改革，还有五万多人口的地区尚在封建制度束缚下面，所以各种生产得不到应有的发展，人民生活也还没有得到显著的改善。
    只有经过社会改革，才能发展国民经济，改善人民生活，才能使社会进步，民族繁荣，这不但在道理上可以理解，而且有许多鲜明的实际例证：内地、邻近州县和州内合作化地区几年来生产上的突飞猛进，以及超额完成第一个五年计划，已是有目共睹，有耳共闻的事了，就以州内展开农业大跃进的情况论比，也足以教育我们：合作化了的维西县一二三区的农业生产高潮，固然跟内地一样热火朝天，就是去年春季才完成土地改革的中甸县金江区，由于从封建制度下解放出来了，又有合作化运动指引着，群众生产积极性空前高涨，二万多人口的地区，参加修水利的达五、六千人，他们要穿山凿岩，兴修三、四十件水利工程，其中有长达六十公里的大水沟，受益二万四千余亩，要扩大稻谷田一万亩；还有三、四千人在积肥料，处处修建圈房厕所，满山去找自然肥，计划增加肥料百分之五十以上，加上小麦加工等其他农活，出勤率已达百分之九十以上，村里没有闲人，冬闲变成了冬忙！但是就在同一个县的大中甸坝，本来有肥美的数十万亩平坦耕地，只要兴修一些排涝工程，就能大大提高作物产量，还有数以万计的牲畜，只要修建一些畜圈就可增加几倍肥料，但是因为封建制度仍未废除，农民生产底垫很薄，积极性也不够高，所以就未能掀起生产高潮。然而人心总是向前的，州内合作化地区、已改革地区，特别是全国先进地区欣欣向荣的情景，有如普照大地的阳光，照亮了州内各族人民的路途，人民群众埋怨迟迟不进行改革，他们向往社会主义康庄大道，要摆脱封建制度的束缚，几年来一直迫不及待地要求改革，而且心愿变成了行动，形成了群众的革命声势。而全州僧俗头人，绝大部分都已认清民族的前途和个人的前途，看见群众的愿望和力量，因而同意改革，许多公众领袖都以积极赞助的态度参加改革工作，所以在前年冬，经过充分准备，根据中央精神和地区特点，制定了和平协商土地改革方案，进行试点改革，到去年春，在党的正确领导下，完成了第一批改革，由于认真贯彻了政策，发动群众，团结上层，保护信仰宗教自由，所以大大鼓舞了尚未改革地区的群众，安定了也教育了上层，现在正在进行最后一批五万多人口藏彝聚居区的试点改革，我们准备在今年第二季度最后完成和平协商土地改革，同时在已改革地区积极稳步地进行合作化运动。在这些工作中，我身为自治州州长又是一个宗教界代表人物，中甸大寺的活佛，应该从人民的意愿和民族的根本利益出发，起好带头作用，现在我已下定决心，放弃剥削，心安理得地为全州各族人民服务。
    社会主义是各族人民的共同目标，社会改革是通往社会主义的必由之路。在我们自治州内完成最后一批和平协商土地改革，以及积极稳步地在已改革地区进行合作化运动，已经是水到渠成不容再缓的事了。民主革命和社会主义革命是群众的迫切要求，是民族的根本利益，现在在州里已经形成压倒一切的革命洪流了，任何力量也阻挡不了它。但是也还有少数不明大义的人，为了剥削阶级的利益，企图抗拒改革，那是背叛民族利益违反人民意志的，必将为革命洪流所击碎，为人民群众所唾弃！目前正在进行的民主革命和接着要来的社会主义革命是要获得全胜的，我们决心在党的领导和国家的扶持下，认真贯彻政策，发动群众，团结上层，完成各项社会改革，进行整风和社会主义教育，克服地方民族主义，鼓起干部群众的革命干劲，快马加鞭，迎头赶上，争取在第二个五年计划内，跟着全国各族人民，大力发展我们的农业、畜牧业、林业和其他工矿企业，力争经济建设的全面高涨，从根本上改变我们贫困落后的面貌！
    最后，我虔诚地祝福大会成功，国家昌盛。
