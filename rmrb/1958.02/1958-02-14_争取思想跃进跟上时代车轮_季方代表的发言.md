I fully agree with and warmly support the four important reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. I suggest that the congress approve them.

In 1957, under the leadership of the Communist Party, China achieved unprecedented and great victories on all fronts. As Vice Premier Bo Yibo pointed out in his report: "After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, great victories were achieved on the political and ideological fronts. This victory promoted the victory on the economic front, and the victory on the economic front further consolidated the victories on the political and ideological fronts." Looking back to the fourth session of the First National People's Congress last year, the people of the whole country, especially the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, under the leadership of the Communist Party, were launching a fierce offensive against the rampant bourgeois rightists and carrying out a strong counterattack. The Party taught us that the anti-Rightist struggle was a revolution on the political and ideological fronts. After completing the revolution in the ownership of the means of production, if we do not follow it with a socialist revolution on the political front, and do not thoroughly defeat the bourgeois rightists who are hostile to socialism, socialist construction will not be guaranteed. Through this fierce struggle, the leadership of the working class over all aspects of our national affairs has been further consolidated, and the broad masses have received a profound socialist education. Facts fully prove that the struggle against the bourgeois rightists under the leadership of the Party is correct and necessary. The brilliant victories we have already achieved and are achieving on the economic front today are inseparable from these victories on the political and ideological fronts.

The shocking anti-Rightist struggle gave everyone a profound socialist education, making them realize that without thoroughly transforming bourgeois ideology, they would not be able to pass the socialist test and would not be able to control the destiny of the country and themselves.

Rightist chieftain Zhang Bojun manipulated and controlled the leadership of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party for a long time, consistently playing his double-dealing tricks. After the high tide of the three major socialist transformations, he tampered with the political and organizational lines of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, using its legal organization and legal status to stand against the Communist Party. In particular, taking advantage of the opportunity to help the Party with rectification, he launched a rampant attack on the Party, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. Because some members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party were deceived by the double-dealing tricks used by Zhang Bojun and other rightists for a long time, they did not clearly understand their anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary nature in the early stage of the anti-Rightist struggle, and showed weakness. The rightists, on the other hand, tried every means to quibble and refused to surrender to the people. This situation quickly changed under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the people of the whole country. We united all the forces in the anti-Rightist struggle, relied on the masses, and adhered to the policy of "presenting the facts and reasoning things out," conducting a series of exposures and criticisms of the rightists. Through these exposures and criticisms, the right-wing clique headed by Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party had to bow their heads one after another in the face of a large amount of evidence, expressing their surrender to the people. Over the past six months, this struggle we have carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party has achieved a major victory. As of January 20 this year, out of more than 9,600 members of the whole party, a total of more than 700 rightists have been ferreted out, and their conspiracies and main criminal facts have been fully recognized by the masses. In this shocking struggle between the two roads, everyone has received the most profound socialist education, realizing that if the bourgeois standpoint is not thoroughly transformed, they will not be able to pass the socialist test and will not be able to control the destiny of the country and themselves. The vast majority of middle-of-the-roaders have seen through the reactionary and ugly faces of the right-wing clique, and most of them hold a deep-seated indignation that is irreconcilable. From the recent discussions on dealing with rightists, they all felt that the Communist Party's policy was too lenient and too great.

Fellow delegates, from this anti-Rightist struggle, we deeply realize that the anti-Party and anti-socialist actions of the right-wing clique headed by Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have their historical and class roots; their failure is also determined by objective laws. In the stage of socialist revolution, after the capitalist ownership system has been basically eliminated in our country, there are only two paths before the bourgeois intellectuals. One is to be determined to change their political stance and follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism, which is a bright road; the other is to adhere to the capitalist stance and take the road of opposing the Party and opposing socialism, which is a road to self-destruction. The right-wing clique headed by Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu failed and were battered and bruised because they adhered to the capitalist stance and took the road of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. They should have known how people like Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek failed, but they did not and were unwilling to learn a lesson from the shameful end of these people. Looking back at history, through the anti-Rightist struggle over the past six months, it is even more clear that the communist society is the inevitable trend of human historical development, and the Communist Party cannot be opposed, and socialism cannot be opposed. Whoever opposes the Party and opposes socialism will be resisting the laws of historical development and will inevitably become a pathetic weeping wretch. Through this anti-Rightist struggle, they have also seen the greatness of the power of the broad masses who love socialism. This is a particularly deep problem we have experienced in the anti-Rightist struggle.

The political stance of most members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has not been completely changed. We must catch up quickly, launch a conscious high tide of self-transformation, learn from the working people, and strive for the goal of being both red and expert, thoroughly transforming the bourgeois nature of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party into a political force that truly serves the workers and peasants.

Fellow delegates, the development of the domestic and international situation in the past year has been so rapid. This favorable situation has strengthened our confidence in building socialism a thousand times. The two artificial satellites launched by the Soviet Union and the declaration issued by the communist parties of sixty-four countries in Moscow have shown with the most eloquent facts that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. The call of the Party and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more has given the people of the whole country tremendous encouragement. 1958 is the first year of China's Second Five-Year Plan, a year in which the people of the whole country, on the basis of overfulfilling the victory of the First Five-Year Plan, are even more confident in taking the posture of an Oriental dragon, riding the wind and waves, and striving for progress. At this meeting, we have already heard the heroic voices from the representatives from various industrial and agricultural production fronts, with the dynamic momentum of "high mountains bowing their heads and rivers giving way." The motherland's rivers and mountains are truly undergoing "rapid changes." People like me who were born in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and grew up in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, like the dozens of senior predecessors present, have tasted the taste of "devastation and misery" for many years. Looking at the past from the present is something that I really never dreamed of. I am really too excited and too satisfied. But looking at the future from the present, and looking at the future from the standpoint of the working class and the communist worldview, it is only the first step in the Long March. Cherishing the past is indeed reactionary, and being satisfied with the status quo will also lag behind. Take our democratic parties, for example. Although we have achieved a major victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, we must also stir up our energy on the ideological and political fronts, strive for a leap forward, a great leap forward, in order to adapt to the wheels of the era that are riding the wind and waves. Although the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has, under the leadership of the Communist Party, smashed the leadership of the Zhang, Huang, and Li right-wing clique, reversed the reactionary political direction, and the great majority of justice in organizations at all levels has risen, and we are working and studying wholeheartedly and taking the road of socialism, the political stance of most members has not been completely changed. If we have the idea of competing with turtles, how can we play the role of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party? Therefore, we must catch up quickly. We must, under the inspiration of this unprecedentedly victorious and developing situation in the country, bravely advance together with our fraternal democratic parties, encourage all party members to actively participate in the general rectification movement on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, launch a conscious high tide of self-transformation, and encourage all party members to strive to go down to the lower levels, strive to go to the countryside and mountains, eliminate officialdom, learn from the working people, and strive for the goal of being both red and expert. We must also powerfully play a role in promoting and promoting the great struggle to catch up with Britain in fifteen years and to realize the program for agricultural development and eliminate the four pests ahead of schedule. Thoroughly transform the bourgeois nature of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party into a political force that truly serves the workers and peasants.

I cannot help but cheer for the infinitely bright and beautiful future of the motherland, cheer for the continuous victory of the socialist cause, and cheer even more for the correct leadership of the invincible and ever-victorious Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and cheer for world lasting peace.

Please criticize and correct my fellow delegates.

Finally, I would also like to warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the current international situation and China's foreign policy, and warmly support the Chinese government's statement on fully supporting the peaceful initiative of the Korean government, preparing to consult with the Korean government on the withdrawal of the Volunteer Army, and demanding that the United States and other countries take measures to withdraw their troops from South Korea. This is another powerful action of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.

    争取思想跃进跟上时代车轮
    季方代表的发言
    我完全同意并热烈拥护李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理以及吴玉章主任的四个重要报告。建议大会予以批准。
    一九五七年，我国在共产党领导下，各个战线上都取得了空前伟大的胜利，这种情况，诚如薄一波副总理在报告中所指出的：“经过整风运动和反右派斗争，在政治战线和思想战线上取得了伟大的胜利，这个胜利，促进了经济战线上的胜利，经济战线上的胜利，又进一步地巩固了政治战线和思想战线上的胜利”。回顾去年举行第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议的时候，全国人民，首先是工人、农民和革命知识分子，在共产党的领导下正开始开展了对资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，进行强有力的反击。党教导我们，反右派斗争，是一场政治战线和思想战线上的革命。在完成了生产资料所有制方面的革命后，如果不随之以政治战线上的社会主义革命，不把敌视社会主义的资产阶级右派彻底打垮，社会主义建设是没有保证的。通过这场激烈的斗争，进一步的巩固了工人阶级对我们国家事务各方面的领导，使广大群众受到了一次深刻的社会主义的教育。事实完全证明，在党领导下的反资产阶级右派的斗争，是正确的，必要的。我们今天在经济战线上已经取得和正在取得的飞跃的辉煌的胜利，就是与这种政治战线和思想战线上的胜利分不开的。
    在触目惊心的反右派斗争中，使大家受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，认识到如果不彻底改造资产阶级思想，就过不了社会主义关，就掌握不了国家和自己的命运。
    右派头子章伯钧长时期的操纵和把持着农工民主党的领导实权，一贯玩弄其两面派的手法，在社会主义三大改造高潮以后，篡改了农工民主党的政治路线和组织路线，利用合法的组织和合法的地位，和共产党分庭抗礼，特别是借帮助党整风的时机，向党发动了猖狂的进攻，企图推翻共产党的领导。由于农工党内有一部分人被章伯钧等右派分子长时期以来所惯用的两面派手法所蒙蔽，因此，在反右派斗争初期这部分人对他们的反党反社会主义的反动本质还认识不清，表现得软弱无力，而右派分子则百般狡赖，不肯向人民缴械投降。这种情况，在共产党的领导和全国人民的支持下，很快得到了改变。我们团结了所有反右斗争的力量，依靠群众并坚持“摆事实、讲道理”的方针，对右派分子进行了一系列的揭发和批判。通过这些揭发和批判，在农工党内以章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球为首的右派集团，在大量罪证面前都不得不先后低下头来，表示向人民投降。半年多来，我们在共产党领导下所进行的这一斗争，已经取得了重大的胜利，到今年一月二十日为止，全党九千六百多个成员中，一共揪出了七百多个右派分子，他们的阴谋活动和主要罪恶事实已完全被群众所认识。在这场触目惊心的两条道路斗争中，大家都受到了一次最深刻的社会主义教育，认识到如果资产阶级的立场得不到彻底的改造，就过不了社会主义的关，就掌握不了国家和自己的命运。极大部分的中间分子已看透了右派集团反动的丑恶面貌，大都抱着深恶痛绝、势不两立的义愤。从最近处理右派分子的讨论中都感觉到共产党的政策太宽大而又太伟大了。
    各位代表，从这次反右派斗争中我们深刻地认识到，农工民主党内以章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球为首的右派集团，他们反党反社会主义是具有其历史根源和阶级根源的；他们的失败也是由客观规律所决定的。在社会主义革命阶段，在我国已经基本消灭了资本主义所有制以后，摆在资产阶级知识分子面前的，只有两条道路。一条是决心改变自己的政治立场，跟着共产党走社会主义的道路，这是一条光明的道路；另一条是坚持资本主义的立场，走反党反社会主义的道路，这是一条自取灭亡的道路。以章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球为首的右派集团，他们之所以失败，之所以被碰得头破血流，就因为他们坚持资本主义的立场，走着反党反社会主义的道路。他们应该知道汪精卫、蒋介石这些人是怎样失败的，但是他们没有并且不愿意从这些人的可耻的结局里吸取教训。回顾历史，通过这半年多来的反右派斗争，更可说明共产主义社会是人类历史发展的必然趋势，共产党是反不得的，社会主义是反不得的。谁要反党反社会主义，就是与历史的发展规律作反抗，就一定会变成向隅而泣的可怜虫，经过这次反右派斗争他们也已经看到了广大人民热爱社会主义力量的伟大了。这是我们在反右派斗争中体会特别深刻的一个问题。
    农工民主党大多数成员的政治立场尚未完全改变，必须急起直追，掀起自觉的自我改造高潮，向劳动人民学习，向又红又专的目标努力，彻底把资产阶级性质的农工民主党，改变成为真正为工农服务的政治力量。
    各位代表，近一年来国内外形势的发展是如此迅速，这种有利形势千百倍地加强了我们建设社会主义的信心。苏联所发射的两颗人造卫星和六十四个国家的共产党在莫斯科发表的宣言，以最雄辩的事实表明了东风已经压倒西风。党和毛主席号召在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，更给了全国人民以莫大的鼓舞。一九五八年是我国国民经济第二个五年计划开始的一年，是全国人民在超额完成了第一个五年计划的胜利基础上更信心百倍地以东方巨龙的姿态乘风破浪，力争上游的一年。就在这次会议上我们已经听到了许多来自各个工农业生产战线上的代表们所发出的那种“高山低头、河水让路”般生动劲头的豪迈声音，祖国河山真正是在发生着“日新月异”的变化；像我这样从清朝光绪年间出世，从半封建半殖民地长大过来的人，也跟在座的几十位前辈先生一样，尝过了多少年“满目疮痍、生民涂炭”的味道，从过去看现在真是做梦也想不到的事，实在太兴奋、太满足了，但是从现在看将来，从工人阶级的立场和共产主义的世界观去看将来，那还不过是万里长征的第一步，留恋过去，果然是反动的，满足现状，也是要落伍的。就拿我们民主党派来讲，虽然在反右派斗争中已经取得了重大的胜利，但还必须在思想战线和政治战线上鼓起干劲，争取跃进、大跃进，才能和乘风破浪的时代车轮相适应。农工民主党虽然已经在共产党的领导下粉碎了章、黄、李右派集团的领导，扭转了反动的政治方向，各级组织的极大部分正气已经上升，一心一意地工作与学习走社会主义的道路，但大多数成员的政治立场尚未完全改变，如果存有跟乌龟竞赛的思想，那怎么还能跟共产党起出长期共存、互相监督的作用呢？所以我们必须急起直追，一定要在全国这种空前胜利发展形势的鼓舞下，和各兄弟民主党派一起奋勇前进，鼓励全党成员在反右派斗争胜利的基础上积极投入一般整风运动，掀起自觉的自我改造高潮，鼓励全党成员争取下放，争取下乡上山，打掉官气，向劳动人民学习，向又红又专的目标努力；我们也一定要为十五年赶上英国和农业发展纲要与消灭四害等提前实现的伟大斗争中，有力地起出一种推动和促进的作用。彻底把资产阶级性质的农工民主党，改变成真正为工农服务的政治力量。
    我现在禁不住要为祖国无限光明美丽的前途而欢呼，为社会主义事业不断的胜利而欢呼，更为战无不胜攻无不克的中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导而欢呼，为世界的持久和平欢呼。
    请代表同志们批评指正。
    最后我还要热烈拥护周恩来总理关于目前国际形势和我国外交政策的讲话，并热烈拥护我国政府关于完全支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议，准备同朝鲜政府磋商撤出志愿军、要求美国和其他各国采取措施，从南朝鲜撤出军队的声明，这又是东风压倒西风的一个有力行动。
