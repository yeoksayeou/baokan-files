    The Development of Hungary's Agricultural Cooperativization Movement
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    Struggling Against Revisionist Tendencies
    In the past year, during the process of restoring agricultural production cooperatives, the central and state party organizations have twice conducted in-depth investigations in rural areas, adopting several measures to combat the influence of counter-revolutionaries and revisionism.

    For a relatively long period after the October Incident, there were also deep-seated revisionist viewpoints and capitalist influences in rural issues. These were mainly manifested in the following problems:

    Firstly, local party and government cadres did not dare to boldly promote and lead the agricultural production cooperativization movement, fearing that this would damage relations with the peasants. Some even advocated abolishing the party and government's leadership over production cooperatives, demanding the establishment of independent autonomous institutions. The local governments of many states, townships, towns, and cities were slow to restore the agricultural departments, preventing many cooperatives from receiving timely assistance and supervision from the state. In the past, there was resentment that the government interfered too much with the cooperatives, but after the October Incident, there was a tendency to let them drift. Only after the publication of the agricultural program and its discussion among agricultural cadres nationwide did most local cadres ideologically recognize the party's policy in rural areas, and realize that developing production cooperatives was the party's unwavering line in the countryside, and the only correct path for peasants to take.

    Secondly, whether a unified model charter was needed also went through many debates. Some cooperatives believed that the past charter was too rigid, and simply abolished or arbitrarily modified it. Almost 40% of the cooperatives did not fully comply with the charter. Especially regarding the distribution issue, most did not follow the charter. They attempted to find new distribution methods, such as some cooperatives not distributing according to workdays but instead adopting methods of paying wages according to land or by the day. Some even adopted distribution methods deviating from cooperation, such as dividing the planting and sharing the harvest equally.

    Whether tractor stations and production cooperatives were necessary, and whether large tractors could be purchased, also sparked heated debates. Some contradictions existed between cooperatives and stations. For example, some stations, in pursuit of numbers, did not pay attention to quality and were not timely in their work. Some stations even refused to cultivate on behalf of cooperatives because the terms could not be agreed upon. Some charged too high fees. All of this aroused dissatisfaction among cooperative members. Therefore, some cooperatives wanted to get rid of the supervision of the machinery stations and payments to them, purchasing large machines themselves. If they had spare capacity, they even planned to cultivate for individual farmers to increase income.

    The government issued a formal notice last summer, confirming that the model charter of the production cooperative remained effective, believing that it was basically correct. It reiterated that private plots should not exceed one *hold*, and that tractor stations should not only not be abolished, but also strengthened and improved in their work. Remuneration should be reduced compared to the past. Production cooperatives could purchase small machines, but not large machines. The public accumulation fund of cooperatives and cooperative groups should not be less than 5%. All provisions in the model charter related to socialist principles could not be changed. Only individual provisions could be modified appropriately according to local conditions. This prevented the rise of some revisionist viewpoints and capitalist tendencies within the cooperatives.

    Production Cooperatives Are More Consolidated Than Before

    The proportion of poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperatives has increased from 38% in the past to 58%, small peasants have decreased from 36% to 27%, and middle peasants have decreased from 26% to 15%. It can be seen that the main members who withdrew from the cooperatives were middle peasants and small peasants. In terms of politics, 20% of the current cooperative members are Communist Party members, which is even better than the situation in industry. The leadership of the cooperatives, who showed steadfastness during the October Incident, have increased prestige among cooperative members, and those who wavered have been replaced. Political unity within the cooperatives has been strengthened compared to the past.

    One-third of the cooperatives have withstood the tests of the two storms of 1953 and 1956 and have persisted. They are politically, economically, and organizationally consolidated. Individual bad elements within the cooperatives have been purged. These cooperatives are the cornerstone of socialism in the countryside. They have taken deep root in the cause of cooperation, and their experiences and achievements have played a demonstrative role among all peasants.

    Two-thirds of the cooperatives were shaken during the counter-revolutionary riots and were reorganized after being dissolved. They suffered economic losses, but internal order, labor discipline, and production enthusiasm are now improved compared to the past.

    The current task of the party and government is to continue to consolidate the existing cooperatives and groups, making them models in terms of business management first. At the same time, they should continue to develop cooperative members, first absorbing peasants who have withdrawn from the cooperatives back into the cooperatives.

    Short-term training courses were opened nationwide last winter to train management personnel. Technical leadership should also be strengthened. The government stipulates that cooperatives with more than five hundred *hold* of cultivated land can hire agronomists. Small cooperatives can jointly hire agronomists, with subsidies from the state. The government's economic assistance to the cooperatives especially emphasizes promoting production. In the past, due to unprincipled assistance, such as providing loans for the payment of workdays, the state also provided loans, which instead fostered the cooperatives' reliance mentality. Some cooperatives were often in debt, damaging the credibility of the cooperative cause. Many peasants were unwilling to join the cooperatives because they saw that the cooperatives had a lot of debt. After the state canceled the regulations on the sown area of ​​crops, how to encourage the increase of commodity production that meets the needs of the country has become the first extremely important issue. The government is now formulating a decree to promote the increase of commodity production in production cooperatives, using price policies to consolidate the commodity production of the cooperatives. The state uses different prices, machinery supply, and preferential loan conditions to encourage the increase in commodity production. In addition, cooperation is promoted by using the agricultural slack season in winter. Now, the first thing to do is to eliminate the closed-door mentality of the cooperatives so that peasants who have withdrawn from the cooperatives can be brought back to the road of cooperation. Secondly, small and middle peasants should be attracted to join the groups first, gradually cultivating peasants' habits of collective production.

    Correctly Treat All Classes in the Countryside

    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, in the cooperativization movement, learns from past lessons and will correctly implement Lenin's three slogans on agricultural cooperativization and the principle of gradual transition. At present, cooperative farmers, including cooperative groups and specialized groups, total about 185,000 households. There are still about 1.5 million individual households, which are composed as follows:

    900,000 poor and lower-middle peasant households with four *hold* or less (some of whom are workers engaged in agriculture), 250,000 small peasant households with four to eight *hold*, 350,000 middle peasant households with eight to twenty-five *hold*, and 4,000 rich peasant households with more than twenty-five *hold*.

    Poor and lower-middle peasants are the largest class in the countryside. Some of them are agricultural workers. They used to be poor and lower-middle peasants and have now entered state-owned farms, tractor stations, and forestry work. They also cultivate a small amount of land at home. Another part works in urban enterprises or mines and lives in rural areas, engaging in semi-proletarian agriculture. There is also a small part who are temporary workers who regularly help others cultivate. These individual households generally operate as a sideline because the land is scattered, and the production level is very low. This class, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants who have joined the cooperatives, have shown the best political performance and the firmest position in the October Incident. This class should be the pillar of the party's socialist transformation cause in the countryside. However, due to past mistakes, there was a lack of political and ideological leadership and organization for them, and the reliance and help for them lacked purpose and principles, which instead promoted the growth of individual tendencies. In the right-leaning period, the middle peasants gained the upper hand, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were abandoned and squeezed out. Now, the party and the government are actively strengthening the organizational leadership of this class in order to establish the dominance of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside.

    The party regards 250,000 small peasants as future cooperative members. These peasants have received many benefits from the new regime in the past twelve years, and it is relatively easy to persuade them to join the cooperatives. Many of them want to emulate the middle peasants, seeing the status of the middle peasants as the prospect of their efforts. Therefore, they need to strengthen ideological education and promote the superiority of cooperation.

    The 350,000 middle peasants are the majority of laboring peasants, with the nature of commodity production. They are diligent and thrifty, and most capable of labor. Their cultivated land accounts for one-third of the country's cultivated land and 46.8% of the cultivated land of individual peasants. These households are an important factor in rural production. Without the participation of the basic masses of middle peasants in production cooperatives, the socialist transformation of agriculture is impossible. However, it is more difficult to attract middle peasants to join the cooperatives. In the past, the principles of gradual transition and low-level forms of cooperation were not emphasized. The current policy is to first guide middle peasants to join low-level organizations, while still emphasizing the method of land dividends in advanced cooperatives, because middle peasants bring land into the cooperatives and are very interested in land dividends. Hungarian comrades have noted that one of the reasons for the rapid development of cooperativization in Bulgaria is due to the flexible grasp of the land dividend policy. Now, on the one hand, in addition to stipulating land dividends, it is also allowed for middle peasants to form cooperatives together. On the one hand, the party and government's policy is to promote cooperativization, but at the same time, it must not undermine the individual economy. Therefore, the government also provides certain assistance to middle peasants in improving production.

    The well-off middle peasants with about twenty *hold*, their living standards have exceeded those of workers and cadres in the city. Because their income is too high, the government has taken appropriate restrictions, such as taxing those who hire long-term workers, and will formulate a progressive income tax for peasants to restrict the development of their capitalist tendencies.

    In the past, there were 75,000 rich peasant households, occupying more than 20% of the country's cultivated land, and they were once a powerful exploiting class in the countryside. By the end of the first five-year plan, most of the rich peasant economy had been eliminated. The "left" errors towards rich peasants in the past were manifested not in taking isolation and restriction measures, but in prematurely eliminating the rich peasant economy, destroying rural productivity. During the subsequent period of right-leaning revisionism, opportunists believed that the struggle against rich peasants was over, and adopted an attitude of class peace towards rich peasants. As a result, the restoration of rich peasants was promoted.

    There are currently 4,000 rich peasant households, occupying little land and having little economic influence, but their political influence is not small. The October Incident proved that the strength of class enemies in the countryside was underestimated in the past, and class enemies were only reduced to existing rich peasants. In fact, some rich peasants also mobilized former lawyers, village chiefs, gendarmes, former military officers, and "workers" from the former ruling class who were engaged in labor in state-owned farms and forestry to oppose the worker-peasant regime and the socialist cause.

    The party and the government's attitude towards the existing rich peasants is not to destroy their production, but to limit their exploitation, mainly to isolate them politically, and reduce the political influence of rich peasants and other hostile elements in the countryside. In the past, strict class discrimination policies were adopted for their children. In the future, attention will be paid to their transformation, education, and use, and a differentiated attitude will be adopted.

    Another reason for the slow development of the cooperativization movement in the past was the failure to earnestly implement the principle of gradual transition. In Hungary, in addition to production cooperatives, there are two other forms of low-level organizations: one is a production cooperative group that only jointly operates agricultural crops, and livestock farming is operated separately; the other is a specialized group, where farmers extract one or several types of cooperative operations from various operations, such as preparing feed together for raising pigs, and irrigating together for sowing rice, etc. However, for a long time, there have been contradictory ideas among group members. On the one hand, they want to enjoy the preferential treatment of the government, and on the other hand, they are unwilling to develop further in the direction of cooperation. In the past, these low-level forms were not valued, and neither propaganda education nor active measures were taken. Therefore, many groups, although they have been established for four or five years, have not been upgraded to cooperatives; some have long existed in name only.

    At the beginning of this year, the government has set more strict preferential conditions. Group members can enjoy better treatment than individual farmers when applying for loans from the state or selling products. However, the group must use 5% of the total annual income as a public investment to lay a material foundation for further cooperation. Generally, small and middle peasants are willing to join such cooperative groups. At present, the number of specialized groups has exceeded the number before the October Incident.

    Another important measure to realize gradual transition was the recently held National Consumer Cooperative Conference. The conference stipulated that it should also assume political tasks in the future, and promote the development of production cooperativization through the activities of consumer cooperatives. For example, when signing production and marketing contracts with individual farmers, it should be considered to organize neighboring fields to plant the same crop, so that mechanized farming can be used. Consumer cooperatives can sell small machines to such combinations, so as to promote the cooperative labor of individual farmers. During the period from 1949 to 1951, consumer cooperatives played a significant role in the national cooperativization movement. Later, under the influence of revisionism, they gradually became purely commercial institutions for supplying and selling goods. Now, its political mission in the cooperativization movement is re-emphasized, making it an important link to correctly realize the worker-peasant alliance.

    The above-mentioned situations show that Hungary's agricultural cooperativization movement has experienced an extremely tortuous and arduous road. The road that Hungary has taken vividly confirms that right-wing revisionism will inevitably lead to the development of rural capitalism, which is the main enemy in the cooperativization movement, and the two are as incompatible as fire and water. After undergoing the most severe tests in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, Hungary's countryside has now begun to embark on a broad road. Hungary's party and government are taking various measures, such as economic measures, political organization, and ideological education, to complete the great task of socialist transformation in the countryside.

    匈牙利农业合作化运动的发展
    本报记者　胡济邦
    与修正主义倾向作斗争
    一年来在恢复生产合作社的过程中，中央和各州的党组织曾两次深入农村进行重点调查，采取若干措施同反革命和修正主义的影响作斗争。
    在十月事件后的一个较长时期内，农村问题中也存在着较深的修正主义观点和资本主义影响，它主要表现在以下的一些问题上：
    首先党和政府的地方干部不敢大胆宣传和领导农业生产合作化运动，怕因此与农民搞坏关系。有的甚至主张取消党和政府对生产合作社的领导，要求成立独立自治机构。许多州、乡、镇、市的地方政府迟迟没有把农业科恢复起来，使许多社不能及时得到国家的帮助和监督。过去嫌政府对社干预过多，十月事件后则有任其自流的倾向。在农业纲领公布并在全国农业干部中展开讨论以后，大多数地方干部才从思想上认识到党对农村的政策，才认识到发展生产合作社是党在农村中坚定不移的路线，也是农民应走的唯一正确的道路。
    其次，是否需要统一示范章程也经过很多争论。有一些社认为过去章程订得太死，干脆把它取消或任意加以修改，几乎有40％的社没有完全按照章程办事。特别关于分配问题，大多不按章程办事，它们企图寻找新的分配方法，如有的社不按劳动日分配而采取按土地或按日支付工资的办法，有的竟然采用分种和收获对分等等脱离合作倾向的分配办法。
    要不要拖拉机站和生产合作社、可不可以购买大型拖拉机的问题，也引起热烈的争论。社与站之间存在过一些矛盾，如有的站因追求数字，不注意质量，工作不及时；有的站因条件谈不妥，甚至拒绝代耕；有的收费太高，所有这一切都引起社员的不满。因此有些社就想摆脱机器站的监督和对它的支付，自购大型机器，如果有余力还打算替个体农民耕种以增加收入。
    政府在去年夏天发出正式通告，确定生产合作社的示范章程继续有效，认为它基本上都是正确的，并重申私人园地不能超过一霍尔特，拖拉机站不仅不能取消，而且还要加强和改进工作。酬金比过去要降低，生产合作社可购买小型机器，但不能买大型机器。社和合作组的公积金不得少于5％。示范章程内有关社会主义原则的一切规定都不能改变，只有个别规定，可以因地制宜加以某些修改。这样才制止了一些修正主义观点和资本主义倾向在合作社内的抬头。
    生产合作社比过去更巩固了
    社的成员，贫雇农的比重由过去的38％上升为58％，小农从36％降为27％，中农从26％降为15％，可见退社的主要是中农和小农。在政治方面，现有社员中20％是共产党员，比工业中的情况还好些。社的领导在十月事件中表现坚强的，在社员中的威信提高了，动摇的已被撤换。社内政治团结比过去加强了。
    三分之一的社是经受过1953年、1956年的两次暴风雨的考验而坚持下来的。它们在政治上、经济上和组织上都很巩固，社内的个别坏分子已被清除，这些社是社会主义在农村的基石，它们在合作化事业中已扎下很深的根子，它们的经验和成就已在全体农民中起着示范作用。
    三分之二的社在反革命暴乱时期受到震动，是经过解散又重新组织起来的。经济上受了损失，但内部秩序、劳动纪律和生产情绪现在比过去都有提高。
    党和政府的当前任务是继续巩固现有的社和组，使它们在经营管理方面首先作出榜样。同时也继续发展社员，首先吸收退社的农民回社。
    去年冬季已在全国开设短期训练班，培养管理人员。技术领导也要加强。政府规定：凡超过五百霍尔特耕地的社，可聘请农艺师，小社可几家合聘，国家予以补助。政府对社的经济援助特别强调以促进生产为目的，过去由于无原则的帮助，如支付劳动日，国家也给予贷款，这样反而助长社的依赖思想。有些社经常负债度日，损害了合作事业的威信，许多农民看到社负债多就不愿入社。国家取消关于农作物播种面积的规定后，如何鼓励增加合乎国家需要的商品生产成为目前第一个极其重要的问题。现在政府正在制定一项促进生产合作社增加商品生产的法令，利用物价政策来巩固社的商品生产，国家以不同价格、机器供应和贷款条件的优待来鼓励商品生产量的提高。此外，利用冬季农闲期间宣传合作化。现在首先要消除社的关门主义情绪，这样才能争取退社的农民回到合作化的道路。其次是吸引小农、中农先入组，逐渐培养农民对集体生产的习惯。
    正确对待农村中的各个阶层
    匈牙利社会主义工人党在合作化运动中吸取过去教训，将正确地执行列宁关于农业合作化的三个口号和逐步过渡的原则。目前合作化农民，包括合作组和专业小组约共十八万五千户。单干户还有约一百五十万，其组成如下：
    四霍尔特以下的贫雇农九十万户（其中一部分为兼营农业的工人），四至八霍尔特的小农二十五万户，八至二十五霍尔特的中农三十五万户，二十五霍尔特以上的富农四千户。
    贫雇农是农村中最大的一个阶层，其中一部分是农业工人，他们过去是贫雇农，现已进入国营农场、拖拉机站和森林业工作，家中又兼耕少量土地。又一部分是在城市企业中或矿山上工作，住在农村兼操农业的半无产者。还有一小部分是经常帮助别人耕种的临时工。这些单干户因土地零星分散，一般当作副业经营，生产水平很低。这个阶层加上已入社的贫雇农，在十月事件中政治方面表现最好，立场最坚定，这一阶层应该是党在农村社会主义改造事业中的支柱。但由于过去的错误，对他们缺乏政治思想和组织的领导，对他们的依靠和帮助缺乏目的性和原则性，反而助长单干倾向的增长。在右倾时期，中农占了上风，贫雇农被抛弃，受排挤。现在党和政府积极加强对这个阶层的组织领导，以便在农村中树立起贫雇农的优势。
    党把二十五万小农看作未来的社员，这部分农民十二年来得到新政权很多好处，争取他们入社比较容易。他们中间有不少人想向中农看齐，以中农地位为自己努力的前景，因此对他们需要加强思想教育，宣传合作化的优越性。
    三十五万中农是劳动农民的大部分，具有商品生产的性质，他们勤俭持家，最能劳动。他们的耕地占全国耕地三分之一，占个体农民耕地46.8％，这部分农户是农村生产中的重要因素。没有中农的基本群众参加生产合作社，农业的社会主义改造就不可能实现。但吸引中农入社则比较困难。过去对逐步过渡的原则和对低级合作形式未加重视。现在的政策是先引导中农加入低级组织，同时在高级社仍强调土地分红的办法，因为中农都带土地入社，对土地分红很感兴趣。匈牙利的同志们注意到保加利亚合作化发展迅速的原因之一是由于灵活掌握土地分红的政策。现在，一方面除规定土地分红外，同时也允许中农可以一起组社。党和政府的政策一方面既要推行合作化，同时又不得破坏个体经济。因此，政府对中农在提高生产方面也给以一定的帮助。
    二十霍尔特左右的富裕中农，他们的生活水平已超过城市的工人和干部。因为他们收入过高，政府已采取适当限制，如雇长工要纳税，并将制订农民累进所得税，以限制其资本主义倾向的发展。
    富农在过去有七万五千户，占有全国耕地20％以上，曾是农村中一个强大的剥削阶级。在第一个五年计划末期，富农经济的绝大部分已被消灭。过去对富农“左”的错误，表现在不是采取孤立和限制，而是过早地消灭富农的经济，破坏了农村的生产力。在以后右倾修正主义的时期，机会主义者认为反富农的斗争已经结束，对富农抱阶级和平的态度。结果助长了富农复辟。
    现在尚有四千户富农，占地不多，经济影响不大，但政治影响则不小。在十月事件中证明了过去对农村阶级敌人力量估计不足，把阶级敌人只缩小在现存富农的身上，实际上一部分富农还发动了过去的律师、乡长、宪兵、旧军官和过去统治阶级出身投入国营农林业中劳动的“工人”来反对工农政权和社会主义事业。
    党和政府对现存富农的态度是不破坏其生产，但限制其剥削，主要是从政治上孤立他们，缩小农村中富农及其他敌对分子的政治影响。对其子弟过去采取严格的阶级歧视政策，今后将注意对他们的改造、教育和使用，采取区别对待的态度。
    过去合作化运动发展缓慢的又一原因是没有认真执行逐渐过渡的原则。在匈牙利除生产合作社外，还有两种低级组织形式，一种是只合伙经营农作物的生产合作组，养畜业则各自经营；另一种是专业小组，农民在多种作业中抽出一种或几种合伙经营，如养猪一起准备饲料，播种稻谷合伙灌溉等等。但长期以来，组员中存在着矛盾思想，一方面要享受政府的优待，另方面又不愿再向合作化方向发展，过去对这类低级形式不予重视，既少宣传教育，也不采取积极措施。因此，许多小组虽已成立四、五年还不见升级组社；有的早已名存而实亡。
    本年初，政府已订出较严格的优待条件，组员向国家贷款或出售产品时可以享受比单干农民优异的待遇，但小组必须以每年总收入的5％作为公共的投资，以便为进一步合作化打下物质基础。一般小农和中农都愿意加入这类合作小组。目前专业小组已超过十月事件前的数目。
    实现逐步过渡的另一重要措施是在不久前召开了全国消费合作社会议，会议规定今后应兼负政治任务，通过消费合作社的活动，促进生产合作化的发展。如与单干农民订生产供销合同时，应考虑到组织邻田播种同一作物，这样可以使用机耕，消费合作社对这类组合可以出售小型机器等，以促成单干农民的合伙劳动。1949年—1951年期间，消费合作社在全国合作化运动中起过显著作用，以后在修正主义影响下也逐渐变成供销商品的纯商业机构了。现在又重新强调其在合作化运动中的政治任务，使其成为正确实现工农联盟的一个重要环节。
    上面所述的种种情况，说明匈牙利农业合作化运动经历了极其曲折而艰巨的道路。匈牙利所走过的道路活生生地证实了右派修正主义必然引向农村资本主义的发展，它是合作化运动中的主要敌人，二者之间如同水火之不能相容。匈牙利的农村在同反革命的斗争中，经过最严重的考验以后，现在已开始走上康庄大道。匈牙利的党和政府正采取经济措施，政治组织和思想教育等各种措施，来完成农村社会主义改造的巨大任务。　　　（续完）
