Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 31st - Prime Minister Nehru, speaking at a mass meeting in Delhi commemorating the tenth anniversary of Gandhi's death, addressed the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council and newspaper reports about Pakistan and other Baghdad Pact countries requesting the United States to provide them with atomic weapons. He said that giving atomic bombs to any Asian country would be dangerous and terrible, and for any Asian country to accept atomic bombs would be suicidal. He warned that in the event of war, the countries that accepted atomic bombs would be the first targets of attack.

He pointed out that distributing atomic bombs, ballistic missiles, and similar weapons to other countries "will completely poison the already uneasy atmosphere in the world today, and the arrival of atomic bombs in Asia will cause a terrible wave of opposition everywhere."

Nehru specifically mentioned the point that "thousands of planes loaded with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are flying over Europe day and night" to emphasize the turbulence of the international situation and the seriousness of the Cold War. He said that now is the most appropriate moment for the Soviet Union and the United States to reach an agreement. He added: "Therefore, some solution must now be reached on the basis of disarmament."

Indian public opinion is increasingly opposed to the establishment of missile bases in Asian and African countries, and many newspapers have strongly condemned suggestions in this regard. Newspapers such as "The Tribune" and "Free Press" have once again called for a summit meeting, as suggested by the Soviet Union, to ease tensions.

　　尼赫鲁总理发出警告
    亚洲国家不要接受美国原子弹
    据新华社新德里31日电　尼赫鲁在德里纪念甘地逝世十周年的群众大会上讲话时谈到了巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议以及关于巴基斯坦和其它巴格达条约国家要求美国向它们提供原子武器的报纸消息。他说，给任何亚洲国家原子弹将是危险而可怕的，任何亚洲国家接受原子弹就是自杀。他警告说，万一发生战争，接受原子弹的国家将首先是攻击的目标。
    他指出，向其它国家分送原子弹、弹道导弹和类似的武器“将会完全毒化今天世界上已经是不安的气氛，原子弹到亚洲来将会到处引起反对它的可怕的浪潮”。
    尼赫鲁特别提到了“数以千计的装载着原子弹和氢弹的飞机正日以继夜在欧洲上空飞行”这一点来强调国际局势的动荡不安以及冷战的严重性。他说，目前是苏联同美国之间达成协议的最适当的时刻。他又说：“因此，现在必须在裁军的基础上取得某种解决。”
    印度的舆论愈来愈反对在亚非国家内建立导弹基地，许多报纸严词谴责了这方面的建议。像“论坛报”、“自由新闻”这样一些报纸都再度要求像苏联建议的那样举行最高级会议来缓和紧张局势。
