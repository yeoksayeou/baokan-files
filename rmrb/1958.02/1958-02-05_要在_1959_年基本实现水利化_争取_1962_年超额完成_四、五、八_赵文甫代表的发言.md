I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the draft 1958 national budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of language reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. Now, I would like to report to the Congress on the development of the water conservancy construction movement in Henan Province.

Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the people of Henan Province have launched earnest study and heated discussions, unanimously expressing their support. The great call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products within the next fifteen years or a little longer has further inspired the enthusiasm of the people of Henan for building socialism. The people of our province are determined to basically realize water conservancy throughout the province next year and strive to achieve an average grain yield of 600 jin per mu and an average cotton yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1962, overfulfilling the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) five years ahead of schedule.

　　**"A Sea of People During the Day, Lights Everywhere at Night" - A High Tide of Water Conservancy Construction Sweeps the Province**

Since September last year, under the impetus of the great nationwide rectification movement, the rural areas of Henan have launched a new high tide of production and construction centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. With the fearless revolutionary spirit of moving mountains and filling seas, the people of the province have been marching day and night towards high mountains and steep ridges, towards deep valleys and steep slopes, towards plains and low-lying areas, and towards saline-alkali and sandy wastelands. The waves of the movement have been getting bigger and bigger, one wave higher than another. The labor force involved has grown from more than 5 million to more than 15 million. The mountains and plains are full of people, "a sea of people during the day, lights everywhere at night."

　　**Original Plans Repeatedly Surpassed, Revised Again and Again, Irrigation Area of 40 Million Mu to be Completed Before Wheat Harvest**

During the movement, the original plans have been repeatedly surpassed and revised again and again. For example, before the high tide emerged, our original plan for 1958 was to expand the irrigated area by 7 million mu; in just over a month of drought resistance and wheat planting, the irrigated area was expanded by 6.1 million mu, almost completing the year's plan. Therefore, the plan was revised to 10 million mu, but it was soon discovered that this target was still conservative and revised again to 20 million mu; however, now more than 23 million mu has been completed, and the plan has to be raised again to 40 million mu (to be completed before the wheat harvest this year). Although this astonishing figure is equivalent to five and a half times the total irrigated area of 7.2 million mu developed in the thousands of years before liberation, it is certain to be realized. According to the latest statistics, the main water conservancy construction projects completed in our province are: expanded irrigated area of 23,410,000 mu, 117.05% of the original plan; drainage and flood control area of 14,680,000 mu, 146.8% of the original plan; preliminary control of soil erosion area of 8,834 square kilometers, 129% of the original plan. At the same time, 777.8 billion jin of fertilizer was accumulated, 117% of the original plan. During the movement, the broad masses of the working people showed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in building socialism, contributing their strength, materials, money, and ideas. The labor attendance rate is generally above 95%, and many reach 100%. According to incomplete statistics from the province, the masses voluntarily contributed more than 500 million bricks, more than 1 million jin of hemp, more than 500,000 pieces of wood, and invested more than 30 million yuan in cash. At the same time, tens of thousands of inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals have emerged like snowflakes. Things that were usually impossible to do can be easily solved as long as we rely on the masses.

　　**The Fighting Slogan Proposed by the People of Yuxian County in the Funiu Mountains: "Mountains Are Hard, But Not Harder Than Our Determination; Mountains Are High, But Not Higher Than Our Footprints."**

During the movement, the broad masses of the working people displayed heroic spirit that could move mountains and cover the world, and countless moving deeds emerged. The people of Jiyuan County, where the story of Yugong Yishan (The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains) originated, are redoubling their efforts after taming the Mang River and continuing to march towards nature. Every day, more than 150,000 laborers are mobilized throughout the county, determined to fundamentally change the natural landscape and build Jiyuan into a socialist paradise of happiness. The people of Yuxian County, located in the Funiu Mountains, proposed the fighting slogans: "Mountains are hard, but not harder than our determination; mountains are high, but not higher than our footprints" and "Protecting water and soil is like protecting our lives, and managing mountains and ditches is like managing our homes." They promoted the successful experience of governing Jiu Mountain and Cai Ping Mountain to all 913 mountains in the county. The red flags of competition are fluttering all over the mountains, and the people are singing "We want to make the 913 mountains bow their heads to the people one by one." In just 14 days, they completed 30% of the original mountain management plan and are determined to complete the five-year mountain management project this year, realizing water conservancy throughout the county. Truly, things that could not be done in the old society for thousands of years and could not even be dreamed of are now being done in dozens of days, a few months, or a year. The people of Yuanyang County, located in the saline-alkali depression in northern Henan and suffered particularly severe disasters for four consecutive years, proposed the heroic slogan: "Bite the bullet, fight hard for three years, muster all our strength, turn the three reds (sweet potatoes, sorghum, red peppers) into the three whites (white rice, white flour, white cotton), turn the saline-alkali depression into rice paddies, and turn Yuanyang into a small Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River)." Nearly 80,000 letters of determination were written by the masses, and 4.4 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed in 50 days, equivalent to half of the total earthwork of the county's water management projects in the ten years after liberation. The county is an old disaster area, and many villages cannot find wives for their young and middle-aged men. In their labor, they held up stone rollers and shouted: "Comrades! For rice, for white flour, for socialism, dig canals and ditches to change the fields into rice paddies, remove the hat of disaster area, not be a food-deficient household, not be a bachelor, let's all work hard!" This year, the county can convert 300,000 mu to rice cultivation, and 150,000 mu to dry rice; next year, the rice paddy area can be developed to more than 800,000 mu, and the county will basically realize rice paddy cultivation and become a small Jiangnan. However, when the masses began to take action, those with serious right-leaning conservative thinking proposed a plan like this: "One year for design, two years for construction, and three years for completion." The broad masses of the working people in Fengqiu County, located in the sandy wasteland north of the Yellow River, are fighting the sandy wasteland day and night, planting trees and forests, preventing wind and fixing sand, improving the soil, opening rivers and digging ditches, transforming depressions, and converting them into rice paddies. The members of Yanglou Agricultural Cooperative in the county are singing in their labor: "The harmful river of ten thousand years will become a beneficial river, the sandy wasteland of ten thousand years will become a green forest, this year we will realize water conservancy, dig up the roots of poverty and plant seedlings of wealth."

　　**Members of Xingyang Agricultural Cooperative Proposed: "Young People Have the Energy of Zhao Yun, Adults Have the Strength of Wu Song, Children are Like Luo Cheng, the Elderly Work Like Huang Zhong, Cadres Plan Like Zhuge Liang, and Women Surpass Mu Guiying."**

In Huaiyang County, located in the eastern Henan plain, more than 270,000 laborers persisted in fighting day and night in the freezing weather, creating many advanced experiences in digging ponds without draining water. The members of Wanggou Agricultural Cooperative in Xingyang County proposed: "Men, women, old, and young are all on the expedition. For the completion of 270,000 cubic meters of earthwork, we worked fiercely. Young people have the energy of Zhao Yun, adults have the strength of Wu Song, children are like Luo Cheng, the elderly work like Huang Zhong, cadres plan like Zhuge Liang, and women surpass Mu Guiying." The masses in Hexi Township, Mi County, proposed: "The bald ridge is big and big, the torrential water is like a tyrant, everyone works together to eliminate the water tyrant, we will realize slope-field water conservancy in sixty days and achieve the 'four, five, eight' target." In addition, many young men and women voluntarily postponed their marriage time in order to realize water conservancy and build a new socialist countryside. For example, Li Mianni from Fangshan District, Yuxian County, discussed with the man's family and postponed her marriage for one year for the sake of water conservancy construction. The thirteen women from Shuanggou Township who returned to their parents' homes also participated in the mountain management project. Dear representatives! What do these countless, indescribable heroic deeds that cannot be found even in the Twenty-Four Histories show? It fully demonstrates that the nationwide rectification movement initiated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has great historical significance in promoting the cause of socialist construction; it fully demonstrates that once the Party's policies are accepted by the broad masses of the working people, they become a huge material force; it fully demonstrates that today's working people have not only become the masters of society but have also begun to become the masters of nature, and that the working people are the true creators of history; it fully demonstrates that under the socialist system, productive forces have been developing vigorously and unrestrainedly, and the socialist system has incomparable superiority and vigorous vitality. The bourgeois rightists' attempt to pull back the wheel of history and conspire to restore the capitalist system has been shamefully and thoroughly defeated.

The reason why the water conservancy construction movement in Henan has been able to develop so rapidly and turbulently is, first of all, because the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines have been resolutely implemented, and the secretaries have taken action, the heads have been responsible, the whole Party has been mobilized, the whole people have been launched, and the whole Party and the whole people have been engaged in water conservancy. Second, it is because, in the nationwide rectification movement, the struggle between the two lines in water conservancy construction has been resolutely carried out, criticizing the erroneous guiding ideologies of isolated management, neglecting mutual cooperation; only draining water and eliminating harm, neglecting water storage and promoting benefits; only engaging in large-scale projects, neglecting small-scale projects; relying on the state to take care of everything, neglecting the self-reliance of the masses, and so on. At the same time, it also severely criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking that "the water conservancy construction in 1956 was not a leap forward but a rash advance," "water conservancy construction cannot be carried out as a movement, but only slowly," "mountainous and hilly areas have difficult conditions and cannot implement water conservancy," "disaster areas can only relocate people, engage in sideline occupations, and do some small business, but cannot engage in water conservancy construction," and "technical forces are limited, surveying and design cannot keep up, and materials are lacking, so large-scale water conservancy construction cannot be carried out," and so on. Therefore, the guidelines of more, faster, better, and more economical and overall planning, comprehensive management, focusing on storage, focusing on small-scale, and focusing on cooperative management have been implemented, combining point, line, and surface management, combining various regions, combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, and combining water conservancy construction with increased production in the current year. The common characteristic of all those with right-leaning conservative thinking is that they do not have enough understanding of the Party's great leading role, do not have enough understanding of the urgent demand of the broad masses to engage in water conservancy and collective wisdom, and infinite power, and do not have enough understanding of the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. They always unconsciously use the old ideological scale of private ownership to estimate the new socialist development process. Experience has proved that constantly carrying out the struggle between the two lines and overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking is the primary key to rapidly and comprehensively carrying out the water conservancy construction movement. Third, it is because the leadership style has been improved, the working method of adhering to the mass line has been persisted in, and advanced experience has been summarized and promoted in a timely manner. In addition to a few leaders staying in the organs to grasp the overall situation, the majority went to the front line, went deep into the construction sites, went deep among the masses, contracted and were responsible for specific areas, established a responsibility system, discovered problems and solved them on the spot, discovered typical examples and held meetings on the spot, and issued circulars on the spot, organizing visits and spreading information in a timely manner. Many leaders worked together with the broad masses of cadres and people, personally operated on the spot, set an example, gained experience, comprehensively promoted it, and spread it everywhere, making the construction site a school and the project a textbook. According to incomplete statistics, the number of cadres and people organized throughout the province to visit and study both inside and outside the province reached more than one million.

　　**Overall Planning, Comprehensive Management, Adopt Different Measures According to Different Situations**

Although Henan's water conservancy construction has achieved great results, it has not yet realized water conservancy, and water and drought disasters still threaten agricultural production increase. Therefore, we plan to expand the various irrigated areas to about 110 million mu next year, accounting for about 80% of the province's total cultivated land of 136 million mu, and basically realize water conservancy throughout the province. Our water conservancy construction policy is: under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive management, focus on the construction of small-scale projects, supplemented by medium-sized projects, and build large-scale projects when necessary and possible; rely on the masses, focus on agricultural cooperatives to run them, supplemented by the state; focus on storage, supplemented by drainage, taking into account both upstream and downstream, and closely combining various regions; emphasize both drought prevention and flood control, emphasize both quantity and quality, emphasize both construction and use; combine promoting benefits and eliminating harm, combine water conservancy construction with increased production in the current year, and combine current interests with long-term interests. At the same time, adopt different measures according to different regions:

In mountainous and hilly areas, implement the policy of overall planning, comprehensive development, combining ditch and slope management, and centralized management, and adopt the method of focusing on storage, closely combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, and concentrating on managing and fully utilizing one mountain, one slope, and one ditch, so as to make slopes terraced and terraces water-conserved. It is required that when the rainfall is within 200 mm, no runoff is generated, the soil does not go down the mountain, and the water does not leave the river; in the event of extremely heavy rainstorms, the flood disaster is reduced. At the same time, various water sources should be utilized, various projects should be built, and irrigation should be developed. It is required that the irrigated area be developed to 15 million mu in 1959, and the area for ensuring planting and seedling protection be developed to 10 million mu, so that water conservancy is basically realized in mountainous and hilly areas.

In the plains, ditches and gullies should be built horizontally, and earthen ridges should be built along contour lines. When the rainfall is 150 mm, it should be absorbed and treated on the spot; when the rainfall is 200 mm, it should be treated in sections; when the rainfall is more than 200 mm, it should be distributed within a large area. In the next two years, 500,000 new wells will be drilled, plus the existing 1.3 million wells, reaching 1.8 million wells, fully utilizing groundwater and developing irrigation. In terms of utilizing surface water, in addition to mobilizing the masses to dig and build a large number of small-scale canals, ponds, small reservoirs for crops, river dams, and ditch and gully networks, the state will also subsidize the construction of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, so that the well-irrigated and canal-irrigated area in the plains reaches 90 million mu, realizing water conservancy.

In low-lying, flood-prone, and saline-alkali areas, comprehensively adopt the "three reforms" measures of changing the terrain, changing the crops, and improving the cultivation system, combining flood control and water conservancy. Plant a large number of water-resistant crops such as rice, sorghum, and medicinal corn according to local conditions. Utilize the water resistance of sorghum and medicinal corn to build seasonal reservoirs, which can both store water for irrigation and develop production. It should be ensured that when the rainfall is 200 mm, water does not flow out, and when the rainfall is more than 200 mm, it can be distributed and treated without generating runoff.

In addition to building a large number of mass-based small-scale projects, some large and medium-sized projects should also be built according to needs and possibilities, so that they can become the backbone of small-scale projects, so as to solve the particularly large water and drought disasters in various rivers.

　　**Expand Rice Paddy Area and Strive for a Great Leap Forward in Agriculture**

In order to strive to overfulfill the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule in 1962, we plan to combine water conservancy construction, improve the soil, and vigorously develop rice production in the next three years or so, increasing the rice paddy area from 7.2 million mu in 1957 to 50 million mu, accounting for 36% of the province's total cultivated land area. This is a key measure for Henan to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production and a major revolution on the agricultural front. According to existing experience, with double cropping of rice and wheat, calculated at an average yield of 400 jin of rice and 200 jin of wheat per mu, these 50 million mu alone can produce 30 billion jin of raw grain, exceeding the province's total grain output in 1957 by more than 5 billion jin.

This year, it is planned to convert 10 million mu to rice paddies, plus the existing 7.2 million mu, reaching 17.2 million mu. Large-scale water conservancy construction and large-scale rice paddy conversion are the primary keys to Henan Province striving for a bumper harvest and a great leap forward in agriculture in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. The province, prefecture, county, and grassroots organizations have all held special meetings to make specific deployments, and the broad masses have already taken action. There are currently four issues: one is water, one is technology, one is seeds, and one is fertilizer. The water problem is being vigorously addressed. The technical problem is being organized for solution. On the one hand, 150 experienced leading cadres and 3,000 agricultural cooperative members with rice planting skills are being transferred from the old rice areas of the province, and 3,000 agricultural cooperative members with rice planting skills are being hired from brother provinces, a total of more than 6,000 people. Each county, township, and cooperative in the new rice areas has teachers to provide specific guidance and assistance; on the other hand, an equal number and quality of outstanding cadres and members are being transferred from the new rice areas to the old rice areas inside and outside the province to study while working. Many of the cadres and members transferred from within the province have already arrived, and all can arrive before the Spring Festival, and those from outside the province will arrive after the Spring Festival. The rice seed problem requires a total of 120 million jin, which is being organized for transfer. In addition to fully utilizing various fertilizer sources, the fertilizer problem is mainly to develop pig raising and fertilizer accumulation. This year, it is planned to increase the number of live pigs from more than 7.4 million last year to 20 million. In 1957, various places in our province test-planted more than 3,000 mu of rice paddies, with the highest yield of more than 970 jin per mu, the general yield of 500 to 600 jin per mu, and the lowest yield of 300 jin per mu. Because this year is the first year of large-scale rice paddy conversion, there is a lack of experience. Calculated at an average yield of 300 jin of rice per mu, 10 million mu can increase the production of 3 billion jin of raw grain.

　　**Criticize Right-Leaning Conservative Thinking, Boost Revolutionary Enthusiasm, We Have Confidence in Realizing Water Conservancy and Overfulfilling the "Four, Five, Eight" Target**

Can Henan basically realize water conservancy next year? The answer can be affirmed from the historical development process of water conservancy construction in our province: before the liberation of the province in 1949, it took thousands of years to develop 7.2 million mu of irrigated area. From 1949 to the high tide of agricultural cooperation in the winter of 1955, another 7.5 million mu was developed in the seven years on the basis of small-scale peasant economy and mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the six months of the cooperative high tide from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, it leapt to 24 million mu, equivalent to more than three times that of thousands of years before liberation, and also equivalent to more than three times that of the seven years after liberation. From the spring of 1956 to the autumn of 1957, although it relaxed under the influence of right-leaning conservative thinking, it still developed 5 million mu. Since late September 1957, under the impetus of the nationwide rectification movement and inspired by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), right-leaning conservative thinking has been criticized and revolutionary enthusiasm has been boosted. In just over four months, another 23 million mu has been developed; it is expected that another 17 million mu will be developed before the wheat harvest this year. In this way, the total irrigated area in the province can reach more than 83 million mu before the wheat harvest, accounting for 61% of the total cultivated land of 136 million mu and 75.4% of the water conservancy plan of 110 million mu. In this way, developing another 26 million mu of irrigated area in one year next year and basically realizing water conservancy throughout the province is not wishful thinking, but completely feasible.

Dear representatives: After another year of efforts by the people of Henan Province, water conservancy can be basically realized, eliminating ordinary water and drought disasters. In two or three years, the rice paddy area will be developed to 50 million mu, and with other measures, agricultural production will undergo a great leap forward. By 1962, the grain output may reach more than 60 billion jin, more than double that of 1957, overfulfilling the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) five years ahead of schedule, and will make more contributions to the country's socialist industrialization, and people's lives will also be greatly improved. Compared with the old Henan before liberation, when there was a severe drought, crops withered and the land was barren for thousands of miles. When there was a flood, houses collapsed and turned into vast oceans. In addition, the reactionary ruling class exploited and oppressed the people, took advantage of the people's danger, and made a fortune from the disaster, creating a tragic scene of people fleeing from famine and begging, wives and children being separated, corpses on the road, and hungry people in the wild. What a stark contrast! Of course, this does not mean that the people of Henan will have nothing to do in two or three years. No, even after this plan is realized, it is only the first step towards marching towards nature, and the journey to the highest ideal of the people—communist society—is still very long. They will never be satisfied with the existing achievements and stop moving forward. This does not mean that Henan has no shortcomings and difficulties in the current and future water conservancy construction. We have encountered many difficulties and there are many shortcomings and errors in our work, and we will encounter many difficulties and make shortcomings and errors in the future. For example, the current development of the movement is unbalanced, and some leading cadres still have relatively serious right-leaning conservative thinking, and new right-leaning conservative thinking will also be generated in the future; the technical design force cannot keep up with the needs of construction; certain water conservancy construction materials are particularly lacking; the task of leveling the land is still very large, and there is a shortage of water lifting tools. To make the existing projects give full play to their benefits, a lot of hard work is still needed; and with the realization and development of water conservancy, a series of new problems that are difficult to predict will inevitably be brought about, waiting for us to study and solve. However, all these shortcomings and difficulties can be overcome through efforts, and they cannot stop the people of Henan from moving forward bravely!

Dear representatives, please criticize and correct any inappropriateness in the above speech!

专栏：

　　要在1959年基本实现水利化  争取1962年超额完成“四、五、八”
    赵文甫代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算（草案）的报告、彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告、薄一波副总理关于一九五八年国民经济计划草案的报告和吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告。现在我仅就河南省的水利建设运动的发展情况向大会作如下汇报。
    自从全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，河南全省人民开展了认真的学习和热烈的讨论，一致表示拥护。党中央提出争取在今后十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召，更加鼓舞了河南人民建设社会主义的积极性。我省人民决心要在明年使全省基本上实现水利化，争取在一九六二年粮食平均亩产达到六百斤，棉花平均每亩单产达到一百斤皮棉，提前五年超额完成全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的粮棉增产指标。
    白天一片人　夜间遍地灯  全省掀起兴修水利高潮
    从去年九月以来，河南农村在伟大的全民性整风运动的推动下，掀起了以兴修水利和积肥为中心的生产建设新高潮。全省人民以移山填海的大无畏的革命精神，夜以继日的向高山峻岭进军，向深谷陡坡进军，向平原凹地进军，向盐碱沙荒进军。运动的波澜，一波大于一波，一浪高过一浪，参加的劳动力，由五百多万人发展到一千五百多万人，漫山遍野，人山人海，“白天一片人，夜间遍地灯”。
    原订计划突破再突破修改又修改，麦收以前要完成灌溉面积四千万亩
    在运动中，原订各项计划，突破再突破，修改又修改。例如，我们在高潮出现前，原计划一九五八年度扩大灌溉面积七百万亩；仅仅一个多月的抗旱种麦运动，就扩大了灌溉面积六百一十万亩，几乎完成了一年的计划。于是，把计划修改为一千万亩，随即又发觉这个指标仍然保守，再修改为二千万亩；可是，现在却已完成了二千三百多万亩，不能不把计划再提高到四千万亩（今年麦收以前完成），这个惊人的数字虽然相当于解放前几千年共发展灌溉面积七百二十万亩的五倍半，然而它是有把握实现的。截至最近的统计，我省已经完成的水利建设主要工程情况是：发展灌溉面积二千三百四十一万亩，为原计划的百分之一百一十七点零五；除涝面积一千四百六十八万亩，为原计划的百分之一百四十六点八；初步控制水土流失面积八千八百三十四平方公里，为原计划的百分之一百二十九。同时，积肥七千七百七十八亿斤，为原计划的百分之一百一十七。在运动中，广大劳动群众表现了高度的建设社会主义的积极性和创造性，有力出力，有料兑料，有钱出钱，有计献计。劳动出勤率一般都在百分之九十五以上，好多达到百分之一百。据全省不完全统计，群众自愿兑砖达五亿多块，兑麻达一百多万斤，兑木材达五十多万件，投资现金达三千多万元。同时，各种发明创造和合理化建议，成千上万的涌现出来，像雪片似的纷纷飞来。平常办不到的事情，只要依靠群众，都迎刃而解了。
    伏牛山区禹县人民提出的战斗口号：“山硬硬不过决心，山高高不过脚心。”
    在运动中，广大劳动群众表现了拔山盖世的英雄气概，出现了无数的动人事迹。为愚公移山故事所自出的济源县，人民在驯服了漭河之后，正在再接再厉，继续向大自然进军，每天全县出动劳力十五万余人，决心要从根本上改变自然面貌，把济源建设成为一个社会主义的幸福乐园。处在伏牛山区的禹县，人民提出了“山硬硬不过决心，山高高不过脚心。”“保水保土如保命，治山治沟如治家”的战斗口号，他们把治理鸠山和菜坪山的成功经验推广到全县九百一十三个山头上，竞赛的红旗，满山招展，人民高唱着“要使九百一十三个山头，一个一个的向人民低头”，仅仅在十四天的时间内就完成了原定治山计划的百分之三十，决心要在今年完成五年的治山工程，全县实现水利化。真是，过去旧社会几千年根本办不到而且连做梦也梦不到的事情，现在居然几十天、几个月、年把子就办到了。处在豫北盐碱凹地、连续四年遭受特重灾害的原阳县，人民提出了“咬紧牙关，苦战三年，鼓起一股劲，变三红（红薯、红高粱、红辣椒）为三白（白米、白面、白棉花），变盐碱凹地为稻田，把原阳变成小江南”的豪迈口号，群众写决心书近八万份，五十天完成四百余万土方，相当于解放后十年治水总工程土方的一半。该县是老灾区，许多村庄的青壮年找不到老婆，他们在劳动中高举着石硪呼唱着：“同志们！为大米，为白面，为社会主义，开渠挖沟改稻田，摘掉灾区帽，不当缺粮户，不当光棍汉，大家加油干！”该县今年就可改种水稻三十万亩，旱稻十五万亩；明年稻田可以发展到八十余万亩，全县基本实现稻田化，变成小江南。可是，在群众开始行动起来的时候，那些有严重右倾保守思想的人，却提出了一个这样的计划：“一年设计，二年施工，三年完成。”处在黄河北岸沙荒地区的封丘县，广大劳动人民，日夜不停的同沙荒搏斗，植树造林，防风固沙，改良土壤，开河挖沟，改造凹地，改种稻田。该县杨楼农业社的社员们在劳动中歌唱着：“万年害河变利河，万年沙荒变绿林，今年实现水利化，挖掉穷根栽富苗”。
    荥阳农业社社员提出：“青年劲头赛赵云，壮年力气赛武松，少年儿童像罗成，老人干活似黄忠，干部策划胜诸葛，妇女赛过穆桂英”
    处在豫东大平原的淮阳县，二十七万多劳动大军，在冰天雪地里日夜坚持战斗，创造了许多挖塘不下水的先进经验。荥阳县王沟农业社的社员们提出：“男女老少齐出征，为完成二十七万土方干的凶，青年劲头赛赵云，壮年力气赛武松，少年儿童像罗成，老人干活似黄忠，干部策划胜诸葛，妇女赛过穆桂英。”密县河西乡群众提出：“秃岭大又大，暴水似恶霸，大家齐动手，消灭水恶霸，要在六十天，坡田水利化，实现四、五、八。”此外，许多男女青年为了实现水利化，建设社会主义的新农村，自愿推迟了结婚时间。如禹县方山区李棉妮，为了水利建设，和男方商议，推迟结婚一年。该县双沟乡走娘家的十三个妇女也参加了治山工程。各位代表！这些举不尽、说不完和查遍二十四史也找不到的英雄事迹表明了什么呢？它充分表明了党中央和毛主席倡导的全民性整风运动，对于推动社会主义建设事业有着伟大的历史意义；它充分表明了党的政策一旦为广大劳动群众所接受，就变成了巨大的物质力量；它充分表明了今天的劳动人民不仅作了社会的主人，而且开始成为自然的主人，劳动人民是历史的真正创造者；它充分表明了在社会主义制度下，生产力得到了奔腾豪放的发展，社会主义制度有着无比的优越性和旺盛的生命力。资产阶级右派分子妄想拉回历史前进的车轮，阴谋恢复资本主义制度，已经是可耻地彻底地失败了。
    河南的水利建设运动之所以能够如此迅速地汹涌澎湃地开展起来，首先，是由于坚决贯彻执行了党中央的方针政策，实行书记动手，首长负责，全党动员，全民发动，全党全民办水利。第二，是由于在全民性整风运动中坚决的开展了在水利建设上两条路线的斗争，批判了那种只是孤立治理，忽视相互配合；只是排水除害，忽视蓄水兴利；只搞大型工程，忽视小型工程；依赖国家包办，忽视群众自办等错误指导思想。同时，又严肃地批判了那种说什么“一九五六年水利建设不是跃进而是冒进。”“水利建设不能搞运动，只能慢慢来。”“山区丘陵，条件困难，不能实行水利化。”“灾区只能移民、搞副业、做点小生意，不能搞水利建设。”“技术力量有限，勘察设计跟不上，物资缺乏，不能大搞水利建设。”等等右倾保守思想。因而，才贯彻执行了多、快、好、省和全面规划、综合治理、以蓄为主、以小型为主、以社办为主的方针，使点、线、面治理结合起来，使各种地区结合起来，使大、中、小型工程结合起来，使水利建设和当年增产结合起来。所有有右倾保守思想的人的共同特点是：对党的伟大领导作用认识不足，对广大群众迫切要求兴修水利和集体智慧、无穷尽的力量认识不足，对社会主义制度的无比优越性认识不足，他们总是不自觉的以旧的私有制的思想尺度来估量新的社会主义发展进程。经验证明，不断开展两条路线的斗争，克服右倾保守思想，是迅速全面的开展水利建设运动的首要关键。第三，是由于改进了领导作风，坚持了走群众路线的工作方法，及时总结和推广先进经验。各级领导干部除少数留在机关掌握全局外，大多数都身临前线，深入工地，深入群众，分片包干，建立责任制，发现问题，就地解决，发现典型，就地开会，就地发通报，组织参观，及时传播。许多领导干部与广大干群一道，亲自动手，共同实地操作，作出样子，取得经验，全面推广，遍地开花，作到了以工地为学校，以工程为教材。据不完全统计，全省组织干群到省内外参观学习的人数共达一百多万。
    全面规划　综合治理  根据不同情况　采取不同措施
    河南的水利建设事业虽然已经取得了很大的成绩，但是还没有实现水利化，水、旱灾害仍然威胁着农业增产。因此，我们计划在明年把各种灌溉面积发展到一亿一千万亩左右，占全省总耕地一亿三千六百万亩的百分之八十左右，全省基本上实现水利化。我们水利建设的方针是：在全面规划、综合治理的原则下，以兴修小型工程为主，中型工程为辅，在必要和可能的条件下，兴修大型工程；依靠群众，以农业社兴办为主，以国家兴办为辅；以蓄为主，以排为辅，上下游兼顾，各种地区密切结合；防旱与除涝并重，数量与质量并重，建设与使用并重；兴利与除害相结合，水利建设与当年增产相结合，当前利益与长远利益相结合。同时，根据不同地区，采取不同措施：
    在山区和丘陵区，贯彻执行全面规划，综合开发，沟坡兼治，集中治理的方针，采取以蓄为主，农、林、牧、水利密切结合，一山一坡一沟集中治理和全面利用的办法，做到坡地梯田化，梯田水利化。要求一次降雨二百公厘以内时，做到不产生径流，土不下山，水不出川；在特大暴雨的情况下，减轻洪水灾害。同时，要利用各种水源，修建各种工程，发展灌溉。要求一九五九年度灌溉面积发展到一千五百万亩，保种保苗面积发展到一千万亩，使山区和丘陵区基本上实现水利化。
    在平原地区，按水平线修成沟洫网，按等高线修成土埂。在一次降雨一百五十公厘时，做到就地吸收处理；在一次降雨二百公厘时，做到分割处理；在一次降雨二百公厘以上时，在大范围内做到分配处理。在今明两年内打新井五十万眼，加上现有的一百三十万眼，达到一百八十万眼，充分利用地下水，发展灌溉。在利用地上水方面，除了发动群众大量开挖修建小型渠道、塘、作物小水库、拦河闸坝、沟洫网以外，还有国家补助兴办大、中型水利工程，使平原地区的井灌、渠灌面积达到九千万亩，实现水利化。
    在低洼易涝盐碱地区，全面采取改变地形、改种作物和改善耕作制度的“三改”措施，把除涝和兴利结合起来，因地制宜大量种植水稻、高粱、药玉米等耐水作物，利用高粱、药玉米耐水性强的特点，修建季节性的水库，既可蓄水灌溉，又能发展生产。做到一次降雨二百公厘时水不外流，一次降雨二百公厘以上时，能够分配处理，不发生径流。
    除大量兴修群众性的小型工程外，也要根据需要与可能，办一些大中型工程，使之成为小型工程的骨干，以便解决各河道特大的水、旱灾害。
    扩大稻田面积  争取农业上的大跃进
    为了争取提前在一九六二年超额完成全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中所规定的粮、棉增产指标，我们计划在今后三年左右时间内，结合水利建设，改良土壤，大力发展水稻生产，将稻田面积由一九五七年的七百二十万亩发展到五千万亩，占全省总耕地面积的百分之三十六。这是河南组织农业生产大跃进的一项关键性的措施，也是农业战线上的一项大革命。根据现有经验，稻麦双作，以每亩平均产稻四百斤和小麦二百斤计算，只是这五千万亩即可产原粮三百亿斤，超过一九五七年全省粮食总产量的五十多亿斤。
    今年计划改种稻田一千万亩，加上现有的七百二十万亩，达到一千七百二十万亩。大兴水利和大改稻田，是河南省争取第二个五年计划头一年农业大丰收、大跃进的首要关键。省、专、县和基层组织都已经召开了专门会议，进行了具体部署，广大群众已经行动起来。当前的问题有四个：一个是水，一个是技术，一个是种子，一个是肥料。水的问题，正在大力进行。技术问题，正在组织解决，一方面从本省老稻区抽调出一百五十名有经验的领导骨干和三千名有种稻技术的农业社员，并且从兄弟省聘请三千名有种稻技术的社员，共六千多人，新稻区的每个县、乡、社都有老师具体指导和帮助；另一方面，从新稻区调出同等数量和质量的优秀干部与社员，到省内外老稻区还工学习。省内抽调的干部和社员，许多已经到达，春节前可以全部到达，省外的春节后到达。稻种问题，共需一亿二千万斤，正在组织调运中。肥料问题，除充分利用各种肥源外，主要是发展养猪积肥，今年计划生猪由去年的七百四十多万头，发展到二千万头。一九五七年我省各地试种稻田三千多亩，最高的亩产九百七十多斤，一般亩产五、六百斤，最少的亩产三百斤。今年大面积改种稻田因为是第一年，缺乏经验，每亩平均以产稻三百斤计算，一千万亩即可增产三十亿斤原粮。
    批判右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，我们有信心实现水利化和超额完成“四、五、八”
    明年河南是否能够基本上实现水利化呢？从我省水利建设的历史发展过程中，就可以得出肯定的答案：全省在一九四九年解放以前，几千年才发展了七百二十万亩灌溉面积，从一九四九年到一九五五年冬农业合作化高潮以前的七年中，在小农经济和互助合作运动的基础上又发展了七百五十万亩。一九五五年冬到一九五六年春合作化高潮的六个月中，一跃发展了二千四百万亩，相当于解放前几千年的三倍多，也相当于解放后七年的三倍多。一九五六年春到一九五七年秋，虽然在右倾保守思想影响下，松了一口气，但是，仍然发展了五百万亩。一九五七年九月下旬以来，在全民性整风的推动下，在全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的鼓舞下，批判了右倾保守思想，鼓起了革命干劲，仅仅四个多月的时间，又发展了二千三百多万亩；预计到今年麦收以前再发展一千七百万亩。这样，全省灌溉面积在麦收以前共可达到八千三百多万亩，占总耕地一亿三千六百万亩的百分之六十一，占水利化计划一亿一千万亩的百分之七十五点四。这样，明年一年再发展灌溉面积二千六百多万亩，全省基本上实现水利化，这不是胡思乱想的，而是完全可以办到的。
    各位代表：河南全省人民再经过明年一年的努力，就可以基本上实现水利化，消灭普通水、旱灾害，两三年后使稻田发展到五千万亩，加上其他各项措施，农业生产将会发生大跃进，到一九六二年粮食就可能达到六百多亿斤，比一九五七年增加一倍多，提前五年超额完成全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中所规定的粮食增产指标，对国家社会主义工业化将会作出更多的贡献，人民生活也将会大大提高。这与解放前的旧河南相比，那时发生大旱时，禾苗枯萎、赤地千里，发生大水时，墙倒屋塌、一片汪洋，再加反动统治阶级的压榨与剥削，乘人民之危，大发灾难财，造成了逃荒要饭、妻离子散、路有尸骨、野有饿殍的凄惨景象，则是一个多么鲜明的对照啊！当然，这并不是说河南人民在两、三年以后就没有事情可作了，不是的。这个计划实现以后，也只是向大自然进军迈进了第一步，距离人民的最高理想——共产主义社会的行程还很远，他们决不会满足已有成绩而止步不前。这更不是说，河南在当前和今后的水利建设事业中就没有缺点和困难了，我们在工作中曾经遇到了不少困难和存在着许多缺点错误，而且今后还会遇到许多困难和发生缺点错误。例如，目前运动发展不平衡，一部分领导干部仍然存在着比较严重的右倾保守思想，而且将来还会产生新的右倾保守思想；技术设计力量赶不上施工的需要；某些水利建设物资特别缺乏；平整土地任务还很大，提水工具不足，要使现有工程充分发挥效益，还须要作许多艰苦的工作；而且随着水利化的实现和发展，必然还会带来一系列的难以预料到的新问题，等待着我们去研究解决。但是，所有这些缺点和困难，经过努力，都是可以克服的，都挡不住河南人民的勇往直前！
    各位代表，以上发言，如有不当之处，请批评指正！
