Comprehensive Utilization of Mountain Rivers Achieves Three Goals at Once

    (Reported by our newspaper) Hunan Province's leadership is planning to "comprehensively utilize mountain river water resources to promote the rapid development of industry and agriculture in mountainous areas." The Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have dispatched three working groups, composed of engineering and technical personnel from transportation, shipping, water conservancy, forestry industry, and industrial departments, after the Spring Festival to Rucheng, Pingjiang, and Yongshun, three mountainous counties, to conduct comprehensive surveying and design of three small river channels. The goal is to ensure that, through comprehensive management, these small rivers can both irrigate farmland, allow the passage of boats and rafts, and also accommodate water turbines or small power stations to develop small-scale local industries. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee plan to gain experience in comprehensive management and utilization on these three river channels, and then gradually promote it throughout the mountainous areas of the province.

    The reason why the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee attach such importance to the comprehensive utilization of small river channels in mountainous areas is based on the characteristics of abundant rainfall, lush vegetation, and numerous perennial rivers in the mountainous areas of Hunan. According to preliminary investigations, there are more than a thousand small river channels distributed in the mountainous areas of the province. After these river channels are harnessed and comprehensively utilized, the following benefits can be achieved. First, from the perspective of developing mountain transportation, river repair is the most economical method. Opening one kilometer of small river waterway generally costs nine-tenths less than building one kilometer of highway. The freight cost of wooden sailboats is also nearly half that of truck transportation. If all the interconnected mountain river channels can accommodate wooden sailboats, a large amount of labor will be saved. Second, from the perspective of farmland irrigation, because the slope of mountain rivers is relatively steep, building dams and gates section by section in the upper reaches of the small river channels and opening canals can divert water for irrigation. This is not only beneficial to the mountainous areas but also to the downstream areas because the function of flood storage will reduce the difference in water level between floods and droughts in the downstream areas, ensuring that the small river channels have a steady flow of clear water. Third, from the perspective of developing local industry, after these small river channels are harnessed, water-powered machinery (such as rice mills, paper pulp beaters, sawmills, etc.) can be installed on the dikes along the river, providing cheap power for local industries, and enabling agricultural cooperatives to run some processing plants for agricultural and sideline products. If all the small river channels in the province can be comprehensively utilized in this way, bringing benefits from multiple perspectives, it will undoubtedly play a significant role in developing the mountain economy.

    Hunan farmers have previously utilized these small rivers. For example, installing waterwheels, water mills, water pestles, and water grinders along the rivers, but in the past, under the constraints of the scattered small-scale peasant economy, the benefits were minimal. After liberation, the shipping, forestry industry, water conservancy, and other departments have also spent a lot of manpower and material resources on projects such as opening waterways and building dams for water storage, but due to the lack of unified leadership and overall planning at that time, these projects mainly benefited one department and could not fully realize their benefits from multiple perspectives.

    Recently, there have been some typical examples of comprehensive management and utilization of small river channel water resources in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the Qianyang Special Zone, which is a great encouragement for the cadres working in the mountainous areas of Hunan. Jishou County used a method of combining public and private efforts to harness and comprehensively utilize a millennium of stagnant water – the Danqing River. This river is fifty-five kilometers long within Jishou, with a difference in water level of fifty-four meters between the upper and lower reaches. Surveying and design began in September last year, and thanks to the active participation of the people along the river, it was harnessed in just three months. Now, four simple locks have been built on this small river, allowing sailboats with a load of three to five tons to pass all year round (this alone can save more than 20,000 laborers who rely on carrying loads on their shoulders and backs each year); seventeen giant waterwheels have been built, which can lift water for irrigation all year round; and thirteen water mills have been installed, which can be used as power for rice milling and oil extraction. The leadership of Jishou County also plans to gradually establish small local industries along the river, such as oil mills, wineries, grain and feed processing plants, and agricultural tool repair shops. In the future, these factories will all be powered by small hydropower stations and water turbines. Guangping River in Huitong County has also undergone similar comprehensive management and utilization.

    At the recent agricultural production conference held by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, many county party secretaries from mountainous areas unanimously agreed, during discussions about the great leap forward in production, that the provincial party committee's proposal to harness and comprehensively utilize small river channels in mountainous areas would have a tremendous effect on promoting and developing mountain production and transportation. They also believed that the conditions for comprehensive management and utilization of small river channel water resources in mountainous areas were now available. Therefore, the Hunan Provincial leadership decided to make a comprehensive plan and first conduct pilot work in selected areas, and then promote it throughout the province after gaining experience.

### 灌溉农田·改善交通·发展工业  综合利用山区小河一举三得

    灌溉农田·改善交通·发展工业
    综合利用山区小河一举三得
    本报讯　湖南省领导部门正计划“综合利用山区小河水利资源，推动山区工农业生产迅速发展”。湖南省委和省人民委员会已经派出由交通部门、航运部门、水利部门、森林工业部门、工业部门的工程技术人员组成的三个工作组，春节后分别到汝城、平江、永顺三个山区县，对三条小河道进行全面勘测和设计，使小河经过综合治理，既能灌溉农田，通行船只和木排，又能装置水轮机或小型发电站，发展小型地方工业。省委和省人民委员会计划在这三条小河道上取得综合治理、综合利用的经验后，便逐步在全省山区推广。
    湖南省委和省人民委员会所以这样重视山区小河道的综合利用，是根据湖南山区雨量充沛，山上草木茂盛，小河流多是常年流水的特点提出的。据初步调查，全省分布在山区的小河道有一千条以上。这些河道经过整治和综合利用，就可收到以下几个方面的效益。第一，从发展山区交通来说，修河是最经济的，开辟一公里的小河航道，一般的比修建一公里公路的投资要便宜十分之九以上。木帆船的运费，也比汽车运费低廉近一半。如果四通八达的山区小河道都能通行木帆船，即可节省大量劳动力。第二，从农田灌溉来说，因为山区河流的坡度比较大，在小河道的上游节节筑坝、造闸，开辟渠道，可以引水灌田。这不仅有利于山区，并有利于下游，因为滞洪蓄水的作用，将降低下游洪水与枯水的水位差，使小河道清水长流。第三，从发展地方工业来说，这些小河道经过整治后，都可以在沿河的堤坝上，装置利用水力的机械（如碾米、打纸浆、锯木等），为地方工业提供廉价的动力，并使农业社也有可能办一些农副产品的加工厂。如果全省的小河道都能这样的综合利用，从多方面发挥效益，毫无疑问，将对发展山区经济起到很大的作用。
    湖南农民对这些小河也曾利用过。如在河边安装筒车、水碾、水碓、水磨等，但过去在分散的小农经济的条件限制下，效益很小。解放以后，航运、森林工业、水利等部门也都花过不少的人力和物力，进行开辟航道，筑坝蓄水等工程，但由于当时缺乏统一领导，全面规划，这些工程主要对一个部门发生作用，还不能从多方面发挥它的效益。
    最近，在湘西土家族苗族自治州和黔阳专区，已经有了一些综合治理综合利用小河道水利资源的典型事例，这对于湖南山区工作干部是很大的鼓舞。吉首县用民办公助的办法，整治并综合利用了一条千年死水——丹青河。这条河在吉首境内长五十五公里，上下游的水位差达五十四公尺。从去年9月间开始测量设计，由于沿河群众积极参加，只花三个月就整治好了。现在，这条小河上建立了四座简易船闸，常年可以通行载重三吨到五吨的帆船（只此一项，每年就可节省二万多个靠肩挑背负来运输的劳动力）；建立了十七座巨型筒车，一年四季可以提水灌田；安装了水碾十三部，可以作为碾米、榨油的动力。吉首县领导机关还计划逐步在沿河建立榨油厂、酿酒厂、粮食和饲料加工厂、农具修配厂等小型地方工业，将来这些工厂都可用小型水电站和水轮机作动力。会同县广平河也作了同样的综合治理和利用。
    不久前中共湖南省委召开的农业生产会议上，许多山区的县委书记在讨论生产大跃进的时候，一致认为省委提出的整治和综合利用山区的小河道，对于促进和发展山区生产、交通有巨大的作用。并认为现在已经具备了综合治理、综合利用山区小河道水利资源的条件，因此，湖南省领导部门决定作出全面规划，并先在试点进行工作，取得经验后即在全省推行。
