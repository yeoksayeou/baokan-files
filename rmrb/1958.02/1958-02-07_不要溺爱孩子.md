　　Don't Spoil Children
　　Wu Tianmin
    Abao is already five years old. His mother always holds the bowl and feeds him bite by bite, afraid that he won't be able to hold the bowl or use chopsticks. Sometimes, Abao asks to eat by himself, but his mother always says to him, "You can't eat by yourself, let me feed you." When Abao wants to go out to play, his mother accompanies him, partly to watch him so he doesn't fight with other children, and partly to help him with urination and defecation at any time.

    Dalan is eager to go to school, so she wants to get up as soon as she wakes up. Her mother says to her, "It's only 6:30, it's cold, sleep a little longer. I'll call you later." One day, her mother discovered that Dalan was washing her own handkerchief and immediately said to her, "It's dirty, don't wash it, I'll wash it for you later."

    Perhaps some people think that mothers like these are good mothers who take good care of their children. In fact, this is completely wrong. Such mothers are preventing their children from developing their own abilities and are cultivating their children's dependence. They not only do not give their children the opportunity to develop independent living skills, but also deprive them of the opportunities to find them themselves. If Abao and Dalan grow up to become weak and incompetent social misfits who only know how to enjoy themselves and don't know how to be diligent, their mothers should be held primarily responsible.

    "Being afraid to give a star and instead giving the moon" is an idiom that satirizes parents who spoil their children. And there are indeed such parents.

    Little Guai's father always brought back some sweets and toys when he came home every Saturday. After receiving this batch of things, Little Guai would make new demands. Little Guai's father would still smilingly record it in his diary and promise to do it. This time, Little Guai was eating when his father came home. The first thing his father did after entering the door was to put a small accordion in front of his son. Unexpectedly, Little Guai looked very dissatisfied and waved his hand, pushing the accordion and other things on the table to the ground. The father was very regretful. He thought to himself, well, his son is already seven years old, and he still buys him such a small accordion, isn't this deceiving him! So he said to Little Guai in a low voice, "Wait a moment, I'll ask Uncle Lin to borrow some money, and I'll buy you a big one right away."

    The younger daughter saw the accordion and couldn't help but touch it. Little Guai slapped her. The mother also slapped her in the face, "You are not allowed to touch your brother's things!"

    Some people say that Little Guai is really lucky to have parents who love him so much. In fact, what kind of person will Little Guai become in the future? Obviously, who else but Little Guai's parents can satisfy him so unprincipledly? When his desires cannot be satisfied, what terrible things will he do?

    These questions are worthy of deep thought by parents.

### 不要溺爱孩子

　　不要溺爱孩子
　　吴天敏
    阿宝已经五岁了。妈妈总是端着碗一口一口地喂他吃饭，生怕他拿不住碗，使不了筷子。有时候，阿宝要求自己吃，妈妈总是对他说：“你不会自己吃，还是我喂你吧。”阿宝要出去玩，妈妈就陪他去，一来可以看着他不跟别的孩子打架，二来也可以随时帮助他大小便等等。
    大兰因为惦记着上学，一醒就要起床。母亲对她说：“才六点半，怪冷的，多睡会儿吧。回头妈妈叫你。”有一天妈妈发现大兰正在洗自己的手帕，立刻对她说：“挺脏的，别洗了，等会儿妈妈替你洗。”
    也许有人觉得这样的妈妈才是对孩子爱护备至的好妈妈。其实，这完全错了。这样的妈妈是在阻止孩子发展自己的能力，是在培养孩子的依赖性。她们不但没有给孩子们锻炼独立生活能力的机会，而且剥夺了孩子们自己找到的机会。如果阿宝跟大兰长大之后成为软弱无能、只会享受、不会勤劳的社会废品，他们的母亲应负主要责任。
    “要星星不敢给月亮”，这是一句讽刺父母骄纵子女的成语。也真有这样的父母。
    小乖的父亲每个星期六回家的时候总带些糖果、玩具等回来。小乖在收到这批东西以后，就要提出新的要求了。小乖的父亲照例笑嘻嘻地记在日记本上，答应照办。这一次小乖正在吃饭，爸爸回来了。爸爸进门后的第一件事，就是把一个小手风琴放在儿子面前。没想到，小乖一看很不满意，伸手一挥，把手风琴和桌上放的其它东西都推到地下去了。父亲很后悔。自己想，本来么，儿子都七岁了，还给他买这么一个小手风琴，这不是欺骗他吗！于是低声下气地对小乖说：“等一等，我去找林伯伯借点钱，马上给你买个大的来。”
    小女儿看见了手风琴不由得去摸了一下。小乖给了她一巴掌。母亲也顺手打了她一个耳光，“哥哥的东西不许你动！”
    有人说，小乖真幸运，父母亲那么疼爱他。其实，小乖将来会变成怎样的人呢？很明显，除了小乖的父母以外，有谁能这样无原则地满足他呢？当他的欲望不能满足的时候，他将会做出什么可怕的事情来呢？
    这些问题值得做父母的深思。
