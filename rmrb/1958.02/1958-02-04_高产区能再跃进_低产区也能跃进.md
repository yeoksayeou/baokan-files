Title: High-Yield Areas Can Leap Forward Again, Low-Yield Areas Can Also Leap Forward

During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, many advanced units emerged on the agricultural production front, achieving leaps in output. More than sixty counties and cities achieved the increased production targets set by the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule, leading the way. However, there were also some places where production was very low, progress was slow, or stagnant. Can advanced high-yield areas leap forward again? Can backward low-yield areas leap forward? The news published in this newspaper today that the Chao-Shan Special District, a high-yield area in Guangdong, is striving to achieve a grain yield of over 900 jin per mu this year, and that Tancheng County, a low-yield county in Shandong, is striving to achieve a grain yield of 500 jin per mu this year, answers this question affirmatively. However, even now, many people still answer this question negatively in their minds.

Many comrades hold the view that once the output reaches a certain level, it is difficult or even impossible to increase it further, at least not to leap forward. This "production ceiling theory" in high-yield areas (that is, the "no leap forward theory" in high-yield areas) is wrong and harmful. Some areas with better natural conditions have been slow to progress because they have been influenced by this conservative thinking, which has prevented them from fully utilizing their favorable factors. The Taihu Lake area in southern Jiangsu had an average grain yield of more than 570 jin last year, which seems like a good achievement on the surface; but a closer calculation shows that the average annual growth rate over five years was only 3.49%. If it continues at this rate, it will not reach the target of 800 jin by 1967. Can the speed here be accelerated? Can production still leap forward? The answer is yes. Yesterday, this newspaper published the news that five special districts in Jiangsu are striving to complete the ten-year targets in three years, and the Suzhou Special District along Taihu Lake is preparing to achieve a grain yield of 800 jin per mu within three years. Because many agricultural cooperatives have not yet fully utilized the superiority of collectivization, the production enthusiasm and initiative of the farmers have not been fully unleashed, and modern agricultural science and technology have not been widely applied, the potential for increased production is still very great. As long as the enthusiasm of the masses can be aroused and organized, a leap in production is entirely possible. In 1955, the per mu yield of rice in Chao'an County, Guangdong, reached 1,064 jin, which, in the eyes of people with conservative ideas, could be considered to have reached a certain height, right? However, thanks to the county's efforts to eliminate disasters, improve technology, and increase the multiple cropping index, the output has increased significantly every year: in 1957, the average output of 310,000 mu of grain crops in the county reached more than 1,200 jin. This year, they plan to leap forward again to more than 1,400 jin. From this, it can be seen that as long as people continue to work hard, the production in high-yield areas will not reach a ceiling, and it will be able to leap forward.

The news published in this newspaper today from Shantou Special District in Guangdong particularly powerfully refutes the "production ceiling" theory in some high-yield areas. In a vast area including fifteen counties, the grain yield per mu has reached 800 jin, which is still unique in our country. However, this area does not think that it has reached its peak, nor does it think that it cannot leap forward. This area is now carrying out two large-scale mass movements with earth-shattering momentum, one is the land leveling movement mainly in the plains, and the other is the land water conservancy movement mainly in the mountainous and hilly areas. These two movements will basically eliminate waterlogging and drought disasters in the entire special district this year, and increase the grain yield per mu to 900 jin or even more than 960 jin. The sandy fields of one season will be transformed into two seasons after land leveling and soil improvement, and the land of two seasons will become three seasons due to the rotation of dry and wet crops. This fact shows that in high-yield areas, there are still many things that can and should be done, and there is still plenty of room to increase production and strive for a leap forward. It is completely inconsistent with the facts to think that once the output reaches a certain level, it cannot be increased or leap forward again.

Some comrades often inappropriately emphasize objective difficulties such as natural conditions and geographical conditions, and believe that production cannot have a leap in development under poor natural conditions. They call this "seeking truth from facts" or "materialism," which is an important reason for the slow progress of production in their areas. It is undeniable that natural conditions have an impact on agricultural production. However, natural conditions are not unchangeable. Under certain conditions, people's subjective efforts, leadership's determination, and practical and effective measures can change some natural conditions. Huang County, Shandong, was originally a place with nine droughts in ten years, and in the past, each mu of land could only produce an average of more than 200 jin of grain. After the land reform, they actively transformed nature and improved technology. In 1952, the per mu yield reached 430 jin. After the collectivization, another upsurge of transforming nature was launched, and in 1956, it leaped to 580 jin per mu. Now the per mu yield of Huang County is more than double the average yield of Shandong Province. Tancheng County, Shandong, published in this newspaper today, was originally a low-yield county. In 1956, the average grain yield per mu in the county was only 189 jin, but this year it plans to work hard for a year to achieve the 500 jin target stipulated in the program, and work hard for five years to catch up with Jiangnan. Although this leap forward plan has yet to be realized, the plan of the Tancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China is positive and reliable, the measures they have taken to increase production are also practical, and the winter water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, winter plowing, pig raising and other work carried out to achieve 500 jin this year has been overfulfilled. They are fully guaranteed to reach the program target this year. Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan Province, is located in a deep mountain, with steep slopes and many stones. In 1953, the per mu yield was only 310 jin. After the collectivization, they vigorously transformed nature, and in 1957, the per mu yield increased to 442 jin. Recently, Lushan County used such materials to refute the saying that "mountain areas lack fertilizer and water and cannot leap forward," unified the thinking of cadres, and unanimously agreed to strive to achieve the target of 500 jin per mu this year. They want to cross the Yangtze River within five years. Facts have proved that as long as conservative thinking can be overcome, difficulties can be eliminated, and progress can be boldly sought, areas with poor conditions can also leap forward.

The saying that "production has reached its peak" and "cannot leap forward" is directly related to the complacency of some comrades. There are some comrades who become complacent when they have achieved a little success in their work, as if they will never lag behind others and can sit back and relax. However, by the time they wake up, they have already fallen far behind others. Gao Ping District in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, is such a case. Since liberation, Gao Ping District has been an advanced district in Zunyi County, and agricultural and sideline production has been doing very well. However, they did not use the existing foundation to strive for faster progress, but instead carried the burden of "advanced", and cadres generally developed a proud emotion of "work reaching its peak, production reaching its peak", looked down on the experience of other places, and perfunctorily dealt with the instructions of the county party committee, and even acted against them, so the pace of progress has become very slow in the past two years. During the five years, the net income of farmers in Songlin District, which is adjacent to the boundary, has increased threefold, while Gao Ping District has only increased by 80%. The grain output in Songlin District has increased by 116% in the past three years, while Gao Ping District has only increased by 37%. In contrast, the originally advanced Gao Ping District is now obviously behind. "Modesty makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind". Every comrade, especially comrades in advanced areas, should firmly remember this teaching of Chairman Mao.

### 高产区能再跃进  低产区也能跃进

　　高产区能再跃进  低产区也能跃进
    在第一个五年计划期间，农业生产战线上出现了很多先进单位，在产量上有了飞跃的发展。其中有六十多个县市提前实现了农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的增产指标，走在先进行列的最前面。但是也有一些地方产量很低，进展不快，或者停滞不前。先进的高产区能不能再跃进？落后的低产区能不能跃进？今天本报发表的广东高产区潮汕专区争取今年粮食亩产达到九百斤以上和山东低产县郯城县争取今年粮食亩产达到五百斤的消息，肯定地回答了这个问题。然而，直到现在，仍然有不少人在思想深处的答案是否定的。
    不少的同志有这样一种看法，他们认为产量到了一定高度，就很难甚至不可能再提高了，至少是不能跃进了。这种高产地区“生产到顶论”（也就是高产地区“不能跃进论”）是错误的和有害的。有些自然条件较好的地区，就是由于受了这种保守思想的影响，使有利因素不能充分发挥作用，因而进展迟缓。江苏南部的太湖地区，去年粮食产量平均五百七十多斤，表面看来成绩似乎还不错；但细算一下，五年间平均每年递增率只有3.49％。如果按照这个速度走，到1967年还达不到八百斤的指标。这里的速度是不是可以加快呢？生产是不是还能跃进呢？回答是肯定的。昨天本报发表了江苏五个专区争取三年完成十年指标的消息中，太湖沿岸苏州专区就准备在三年内达到粮食亩产量八百斤。因为目前很多农业社还没有充分发挥合作化的优越性，农民们的生产热情和积极性还没有充分发挥出来，现代化的农业科学技术还没有普遍运用，增产的潜力还大得很。只要能把群众的干劲鼓动起来，组织起来，生产的跃进就是完全可能的。广东潮安县1955年水稻的亩产量已经达到一千零六十四斤，这在有保守思想的人看来，可算是到了一定高度了吧？但是由于这个县努力消除灾害，改进技术，提高复种指数，产量还是年年都有很大提高：1957年全县三十一万亩粮食作物的平均产量到了一千二百多斤。今年他们计划再跃进到一千四百多斤。由此看来，只要人们不断努力，高产地区的生产也是不会到顶的，也是能够跃进的。
    今天本报发表的广东汕头专区的消息，特别有力地驳斥了某些高产地区的“生产到顶”论。在一个包括十五个县的广大地区，粮食亩产达到八百斤，在我国现在还是独一无二的。然而这个地区并不以为这就到顶了，也不认为就不能跃进了。这个地区现在正以移山倒海之势进行着两个大规模的群众运动，一是以平原地区为主的土地大平整运动，一是以山区、丘陵区为主的土地水利化运动。这两个运动将使全专区在今年基本消灭水旱灾害，粮食亩产提高到九百斤甚至九百六十斤以上。一造的沙田将经过平整土地和改良土壤变为两熟，两熟的土地将因水旱作物轮种而变为三熟。这个事实说明：在高产的地区，能够做和应该做的事情仍然很多，提高产量以至争取跃进仍然大有余地。认为产量达到一定高度就不能再提高、再跃进，是完全不合事实的。
    也有一些同志时常不适当地强调自然条件、地理条件等等客观的困难，认为在较差的自然条件之下，生产就不可能有飞跃的发展。他们把这称为“实事求是”或“唯物主义”，这是他们的地区生产进展迟缓的重要原因。不可否认，自然条件对农业生产是有影响的。但是，自然条件并不是不可改变的。在一定条件下的人的主观努力、领导的决心和切实有效的措施，就可以改变某些自然条件。山东黄县本来是个十年九旱的地方，过去每亩地平均只能产粮二百多斤。土地改革以后，积极改造自然，改进技术，1952年亩产量便达到四百三十斤。合作化以后又掀起一次改造自然的高潮，1956年便跃进到了亩产五百八十斤。现在黄县的亩产量已经高过山东全省平均产量一倍以上。今天本报发表的山东郯城县，原来是个低产县，1956年全县粮食亩产平均只有一百八十九斤，但今年计划苦战一年，实现纲要规定的五百斤指标，苦战五年，赶上江南。虽然这个跃进的规划尚待争取实现，但是中共郯城县委的计划是积极可靠的，他们采取的增产措施也是切实的，而且为实现今年达到五百斤而进行的冬季水利、积肥、冬耕、养猪等工作已经超额完成。他们今年达到纲要指标是有充分保证的。河南鲁山县的燎原农业社地处深山，坡陡石多，1953年的亩产量只有三百一十斤。合作化以后大力改造自然，1957年亩产量便提高到了四百四十二斤。最近鲁山县运用这类材料，驳倒了“山区缺肥少水、不能跃进”的说法，统一了干部思想，一致同意争取今年实现亩产五百斤的指标，他们要在五年以内跨过长江。事实证明，只要能够克服保守思想，排除困难，锐意求进，条件不好的地区也是可以跃进的。
    “生产到顶”、“不能跃进”的说法，同某些同志的骄傲自满情绪直接关联着。有这样一些同志，他们在工作稍微有点成绩的时候，便自满起来，似乎永远也不会落在别人后面，可以高枕而卧了。可是，等到一觉醒来，却已远远地落在别人后面了。贵州遵义县的高坪区就是这种情形。解放以来，高坪区一直是遵义县的先进区，农副业生产都搞得很好。但是他们没有利用已有的基础争取更快的前进，却背上了“先进”的包袱，干部中普遍产生“工作到顶、生产到顶”的骄傲情绪，瞧不起外地经验，对县委指示敷衍塞责，甚至阳奉阴违，因而近两年来前进步伐变得非常缓慢。地界毗连的松林区五年间农民纯收入增加了三倍，而高坪区只增加八成。松林区最近三年的粮食产量增加了116％，而高坪区只增加了37％。相形之下，原来先进的高坪区现在明显地落后了。“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。每个同志特别是先进地区的同志，应该牢牢地记住毛主席的这一教诲。
