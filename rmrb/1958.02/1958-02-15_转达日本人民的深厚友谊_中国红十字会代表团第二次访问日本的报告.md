Conveying the Profound Friendship of the Japanese People
—Report on the Second Visit to Japan by the Chinese Red Cross Delegation—
Li Dequan
Since the Chinese Red Cross Delegation visited Japan in November 1954, three full years have passed. During these three years, the Chinese Red Cross, in the spirit of humanitarianism, and with the strong support of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, has made continuous efforts to assist Japanese nationals in returning to their country, assist Japanese war criminals who have been leniently treated and released in returning to their country, assist Japanese women in returning to Japan to visit relatives, return the remains of Japanese who died in China to Japan, and help investigate the whereabouts of Japanese people. These efforts have not only garnered deep gratitude from all sectors of Japanese society for the tremendous assistance from the Chinese Red Cross and the Chinese people, but have also further promoted the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. At the same time, friends from all walks of life in Japan, Korean friends, and overseas Chinese compatriots have continued to make significant efforts to collect and return the remains of Chinese martyrs. To date, 2,724 sets of remains of martyrs have been returned to China. We should thank the Japanese people for carrying out this work under various difficulties, a fact that demonstrates the broad Japanese people's love for peace and their desire for Sino-Japanese friendship. On October 4, 1956, Chairman Li Dequan sent a letter to the Executive Committee for the Consolation of Chinese Captives and Martyrs, expressing the hope of the Chinese Red Cross to send a delegation to visit Japan again, in order to express face-to-face, on behalf of the Chinese people and the families of the martyrs, gratitude to the Japanese people for their efforts in returning the remains of the martyrs and to commemorate the martyrs who died in Japan; and at the same time to make new contributions in strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. On June 3, 1957, upon the formal invitation of Mr. Oya Keijun, Chairman of the Welcome Committee for the Chinese Red Cross Delegation, which was composed of more than seventy Japanese civil organizations, and after repeated efforts and urging from friends from all walks of life in Japan, the second friendly visit was finally realized.

The Chinese Red Cross Delegation, led by Chairman Li Dequan and Deputy Leader Liao Chengzhi, a group of thirteen people, left Beijing on December 2, 1957, arrived in Tokyo on the 6th, and ended its formal visit schedule on the 27th, leaving Japan on January 9, 1958, and returning to China.

During this three-week visit in Japan, the Chinese Red Cross Delegation visited Tokyo, Sapporo, Otaru, Hakodate, Aomori, Akita, Nagoya, Gifu, Osaka, Kobe, Nara, Kyoto, Okayama, Tamano, Shimonoseki, Moji, Fukuoka, Mito, Hitachi, Kawasaki, Yokohama, and other places, visiting more cities and villages than during its first visit to Japan. The people from all walks of life that were contacted were also more extensive than last time. To welcome the Chinese Red Cross Delegation, a massive nationwide mass movement was launched among the Japanese people. Therefore, wherever the delegation went, it received enthusiastic welcome and cordial reception from the masses. Japanese friends said that the delegation was like a warm current, wherever it went, it became warm. Welcome rallies were held in all locations. At stations and on streets, large welcome slogan towers were erected and large horizontal street banners were hung. People waved the national flags of China and Japan, as well as the flags of various organizations and units. In some places, thousands upon thousands of people lined the streets to welcome the delegation. Women and children in festive attire presented the delegation with bouquets of flowers. When passing through the streets, some people scattered colorful paper flowers from windows on the upper floors. Chinese music was played through loudspeakers, and the cheers of the masses were interspersed with the sound of firecrackers, the scene was just like a festival.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese imperialism kidnapped hundreds of thousands of Chinese people, forcing them to engage in heavy labor in mines, harbors, and factories throughout Japan, resulting in the massacre of large numbers of Chinese people or death due to overwork and malnutrition. This time, the delegation went to Hanaoka, Akita Prefecture, where the Hanaoka massacre occurred, and also to many places where Chinese martyrs died. The Red Cross Delegation mourned the Chinese martyrs at their graves with heavy hearts. Naturally, these have all become the past, and what we see now is a completely different scene from the past. When the delegation arrived in Hanamaki, Hanawa, and Osarizawa, the men, women, and children of these towns all held the national flags of China and Japan and cheered and waved to the delegation along the streets. Every household hung the flags of Japan and the People's Republic of China. They welcomed the Chinese Red Cross Delegation as if they were welcoming their closest guests. In our conversations with Japanese friends, we learned that even in the most difficult years, the local residents were full of sympathy for the Chinese. They gave the Chinese food and cigarettes, and they extended friendly hands to the Chinese martyrs. These all deeply moved the delegation. There we also had the opportunity to meet with Korean friends who had worked alongside the Chinese martyrs and shared their hardships. They and the Japanese people helped the Chinese refugees. Especially after the end of the war, Korean friends overcame various obstacles and carried out a great deal of work under very difficult circumstances in order to excavate and return the remains of the martyrs who died in Hanaoka. We express our deep gratitude to the local Korean friends, Japanese friends, and overseas Chinese in Japan for their friendly and humanitarian work. Throughout Japan, we heard that the Japanese people had spent huge amounts of manpower and material resources to collect the remains of Chinese martyrs. They even investigated the name, place of origin, age, and date of death of each martyr. In particular, workers, peasants, and Buddhist figures have provided the greatest assistance to this work. In Hokkaido, we learned that the workers of the Muroran Japan Steel Company, during a year-long strike against layoffs, spent three consecutive days excavating the remains of martyrs. In Okayama Prefecture, in order to bury the remains of Chinese martyrs collected by more than a thousand monks, a delicate and magnificent Soul Gathering Hall for the remains of Chinese martyrs has been built on Mount Kannonin in Tamano City.

During the visit to Japan, local Japanese friends and the Japanese people, in order to commemorate the Chinese martyrs who died in various parts of Japan during the war, held solemn and grand memorial services in Tokyo, Hokkaido, Akita, Gifu, Osaka, Kobe, Okayama, Fukuoka, Ibaraki, and other places. In Tokyo, Mr. Oya Keijun, Chairman of the Welcome Committee for the Chinese Red Cross Delegation and Chairman of the Executive Committee for the Consolation of Chinese Captives and Martyrs, Mr. Takaoka Ryosen, Chairman of the All-Japan Buddhist Association, Mr. Kazami Akira, Director of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Mr. Hirano Yoshitaro, Director of the Japan Peace Committee, Mr. Katayama Tetsu, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo, Director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Mr. Hatakeda Satomi and Mr. Nishizawa Ryuji, Standing Committee Members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Mr. Okamoto Shigeho, Standing Director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Ms. Oyama Ryuko, Chairman of the Japan National Relief Association, as well as representatives from all walks of life, about four hundred people, participated in the memorial service. In the memorial services in various places, the local prefectural governors, mayors, chairmen of the prefectural assemblies, as well as representatives and friends from all walks of life, also participated. They represented the Japanese people in expressing condolences to the Chinese martyrs who died in Japan and expressed apologies to the families of the Chinese martyrs and the Chinese people. In their eulogies, they unanimously emphasized that the Japanese people resolutely oppose war and will never allow the mistakes of the past committed by Japanese imperialism to be repeated, and rely on lasting peace in Asia, Africa and the world. The Japanese people demanded efforts to realize friendly relations between Japan and China, and restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China as soon as possible, in order to comfort the heroic spirits of the Chinese martyrs. Mr. Oya Keijun repeatedly stated that in order not to repeat the mistakes of the past committed by Japan, and to further strive for peace and happiness, the Japanese people must join hands with the Chinese people and work together. He said that this is an undertaking to realize peace in Asia, Africa and the world. At the memorial service, many people expressed their willingness to continue the work of collecting and returning the remains of the martyrs in the future. According to Mr. Oya Keijun, 143 more sets of remains of martyrs have been collected in various parts of Japan, and they are preparing to return them to China soon. At the memorial services held in various places, the Chinese Red Cross Delegation expressed its gratitude on behalf of the families of the martyrs and the Chinese people. The humanitarian actions carried out in this regard by Mr. Oya Keijun and other gentlemen of the Executive Committee for the Consolation of Chinese Captives and Martyrs, friends from all walks of life, and the Japanese people, are a manifestation of the Japanese people's love for peace, opposition to war, and friendship with the Chinese people. The traditional friendly relations between China and Japan for two thousand years should be rapidly restored on a new basis of equality and mutual benefit, and China and Japan should re-enter a new historical stage of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence, so that the generations of Chinese and Japanese people will always live in friendship and never encounter the disasters of war again. Only in this way can we comfort the sacrificed martyrs and educate this generation of people. The delegation this time handed over to Mr. Oya Keijun a list of 2,306 sets of remains of Japanese who died in China (32 of whom were named), which the Chinese Red Cross had found based on the materials provided by the Japanese delegation to China and the Japanese people, and expressed the willingness of the Chinese Red Cross to continue to assist in the investigation, collection, and return of the remains of Japanese people. Prior to this, the Chinese Red Cross had returned 142 sets and 14 boxes of Japanese remains found in Yunnan, Shanghai, and Northeast China to Japan.

During the visit, the delegation held fifteen press conferences, participated in welcome mass rallies held for the delegation in Tokyo, Osaka, Hakodate, Hanawa Town in Akita Prefecture, Mito, and Okayama, and attended more than sixty welcome receptions, banquets, tea parties, garden parties, and forums. In Tokyo, the delegation also visited the Executive Committee for the Consolation of Chinese Captives and Martyrs, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, the Social and Labor Committee of the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and the Japan National Relief Association and other organizations. Members of the Diet from various parties of the Japanese House of Representatives also specially held a tea party to welcome the delegation. The delegation was welcomed and warmly received by the responsible persons of local governments such as the prefectural governors, chairmen of prefectural assemblies, mayors, and chairmen of city councils in many places. The delegation had the opportunity to meet with representatives from all walks of life in politics, economics, culture, arts, academia, news, publishing, medicine, fishery, religion, as well as youth, women, and trade unions in Tokyo and the places it visited, and met extensively with the Japanese people in various places.

We are very grateful to Mr. Oya Keijun and other gentlemen and friends from all walks of life in the central and local Welcome Committees for the Chinese Red Cross Delegation for their warm and thoughtful reception and arrangements. The friendly visits and extensive contacts in various parts of Japan further strengthened mutual understanding and enhanced friendship.

Through this visit, we deeply felt that, due to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese peoples in recent years, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples have been established and are developing day by day. People from all walks of life in Japan are eager for the Chinese and Japanese peoples to be forever friendly and live together in peace, restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible, and further conduct economic, cultural, and technical exchanges. This is something that no external force can destroy or obstruct. Mr. Shinoda Hiroshi, a member of the Japanese Diet and former Deputy Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, said at a banquet held by the Welcome Committee: "The friendly relations between Japan and China have been established and have become flesh and blood relations." Mr. Yamamoto Kumaichi, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, said in his speech at a welcome reception held by the economic circles: "The entire Japanese people welcome the arrival of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan with the same feeling as welcoming their mothers and brothers." And expressed: "Japanese manufacturers and economic circles are eager for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and are willing not only to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations from the economic exchange, but also to further strengthen cultural and other exchanges to contribute to the peace of Asia and the world." He also expressed his belief at the meeting that, with the efforts of the people of the two countries, the fourth Japan-China trade agreement will definitely be signed in the near future. Mr. Arita Hachiro, who had visited China not long ago, once said at a welcome luncheon: "Although diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not been restored, the foundation for restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries has long been established." Mr. Asanuma Inejiro, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, said in his speech at a welcome tea party held by members of the Japanese Diet: "The fact that we can hold a tea party in the Japanese Diet today to welcome the Chinese Red Cross Delegation, and that Mr. Masutani Hideji, Speaker of the House of Representatives, also participated in the welcome party, shows that Sino-Japanese relations are moving forward." Mr. Nosaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, said at the farewell reception for the delegation in Tokyo: "The second visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan is of great significance. It brought the friendship of the Chinese people and promoted the further development of friendly relations between the two countries." The responsible persons of the Japanese local governments and all Japanese friends who the delegation contacted unanimously stated that the traditional friendly relations between China and Japan must be restored. They opposed the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and expressed their willingness to overcome all difficulties to promote the early establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. They believed that the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation promoted the further development of relations between the two countries. Mr. Obata Tadayoshi, Chairman of the Osaka Welcome Committee, said at a welcome mass rally attended by representatives from various circles in the two prefectures and five counties of the Kansai region of Japan and about 1,500 people: "When we first welcomed the Chinese Red Cross Delegation in Osaka, we did not understand each other completely, but after three years, when we welcome you again today, this situation has completely changed." He also expressed that the people of Osaka believed that when the third time they welcomed the Chinese Red Cross Delegation, China and Japan had already restored diplomatic relations. Mr. Tabuchi Hisashi, the mayor of Okayama City, said at a banquet held by various circles in Okayama Prefecture to welcome the delegation: "Okayama Prefecture, from the prefectural governor to 1.6 million prefectural residents, only recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China, and diplomatic relations between Japan and China must be restored." These words represent the sincere wishes of millions of Japanese people.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by Japanese people who had lived in China. They repeatedly expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people and the Chinese Red Cross for assisting nearly 30,000 Japanese nationals in China to return to their country since 1953. When these returnees met with the delegation in various places, they were like meeting relatives. Some of them were still wearing the clothes they wore when they lived in China, some spoke fluent Chinese and continued to learn Chinese. Some asked to bring letters and things to Chinese friends. In short, they expressed a strong feeling of friendship and nostalgia for the new China. The delegation was also warmly welcomed by Japanese war criminals who had been leniently treated and released in various places. They deeply thanked the lenient policy of the government of the People's Republic of China, which released more than 1,000 war criminals and assisted them in returning to their country since 1956. The delegation met with representatives and families of the released war criminals in various places, participated in the forum held by them in Tokyo, and some came from very far away, introduced his family, sent photos, and some wept bitterly, they expressed their apologies to the Chinese people. They expressed that as long as they are alive, they will resolutely contribute everything to the cause of opposing war and defending peace, and make the greatest efforts for the friendship between China and Japan. Overseas Chinese and Korean residents in Japan also warmly welcomed the delegation. The delegation always took time out of its busy schedule to introduce to the overseas Chinese the tremendous achievements of the new China's construction, and encouraged the overseas Chinese to strengthen unity, love their motherland, abide by the laws of the country of residence, and promote the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people.

The Chinese Red Cross Delegation expressed that after returning to China, it must convey the deep friendship expressed by Japanese friends from all walks of life and the Japanese people to the Chinese people. Through this visit to Japan, the delegation also conveyed the friendly wishes of the Chinese people to the Japanese people. In its speeches in various places, the delegation pointed out that China and Japan have had friendly historical relations for thousands of years, and only in the recent few decades have there been unpleasant relations, but that has become a thing of the past. After the Second World War, China and Japan have undergone great changes. The liberated Chinese people are now building the socialist society of their motherland, and the Japanese people are fighting for peace and independence. Because the circumstances of the Chinese and Japanese peoples have changed, the feelings of the two peoples have also changed. The delegation expressed the sympathy and support of the Chinese people for the current situation of the Japanese people and the struggles they are waging. The delegation told the Japanese people that the Chinese government's policy of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence towards Japan is an important part of China's peaceful diplomatic policy, because the Chinese people know that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples not only conforms to the interests of the two peoples, but also is conducive to peace in Asia and world peace. The delegation also pointed out that the current international situation has undergone fundamental changes, the forces of peace have surpassed the forces of war, the east wind has prevailed over the west wind, and the world situation has thus entered a new turning point. The fantasies of a small handful of warmongers are even more difficult to realize. The delegation told them that after this visit to Japan, it deeply felt that the voices of the Japanese people demanding Sino-Japanese friendship and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries are more widespread and more developed than three years ago. The tree of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, cultivated on such a basis, cannot be blown down by any typhoon. The delegation also introduced to the Japanese people the achievements of China's construction over the past few years and the prospects of its long-term plans, and expressed that in the future it will be necessary to further develop economic, cultural and technical exchanges between the two countries. The delegation told the Japanese people that despite the fact that some Western rulers do not like and do not recognize the new China, there is no force in the world that can stop the progress of the 640 million Chinese people. The delegation also repeatedly emphasized that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and oppose any political conspiracy to create "two Chinas", clarifying our firm position. When the delegation talked about the above issues, it won warm applause and inner resonance from the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Japanese people expressed their support for the just position of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, and at the same time, the delegation expressed the support of the Chinese people for the Japanese people's struggle to recover Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands from the occupation of US imperialism.

During its visit to Japan, the delegation also held talks with three groups, namely the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and exchanged views on relevant issues. The delegation also handed over to the three Japanese groups a list of 880 Japanese people, which had been investigated based on the letters provided by the Japanese people over the years and the materials brought by the Japanese delegations to China over the years. Prior to this, the Chinese Red Cross had notified the three Japanese groups and their families of the news of 286 Japanese nationals in China. At the meeting, the delegation repeatedly urged the three Japanese groups to send ships as soon as possible to pick up the Japanese nationals who are preparing to return to their country and the Japanese war criminals who were released last September. The delegation stated that the Chinese Red Cross will continue to assist Japanese nationals in returning to their country, Japanese women in returning to their country to visit relatives, and investigating the news of Japanese people in China.

During its visit to Japan, the delegation also visited Kansai University in Osaka, the Osaka Blood Bank, Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, the undersea highway between Shimonoseki and Moji, the Tokai Village Atomic Energy Research Institute in Ibaraki Prefecture, the Hitachi Machine Works, the Hitachi Mine Smelting Plant of the Japan Mining Company, the Canon Camera Factory in Tokyo, the China Research Institute, the Shiseido Cosmetics Factory, the Fukuoka Orphanage, the Nanny Training Institute and other units. The delegation also toured the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto, Nara Horyuji Temple, Todaiji Temple Great Buddha Hall, as well as the aquariums in Tamano, Shimonoseki, Numazu, and the Hakone scenic area. The Japanese people have shown their high wisdom in the fields of construction, science, technology and culture, and we admire these very much. We were pleased to visit the tombs of Tang Dynasty monk Ganjin and Chinese scholar Zhu Shunshui of the late Ming Dynasty in Nara and Ota City, Ibaraki Prefecture. Chinese people established a deep friendship with the Japanese people more than a thousand years ago, and these two Chinese pioneers made brilliant examples for the friendship between China and Japan.

When we ended our visit to Japan and returned to China, the moving scenes of the Japanese people warmly welcoming the delegation in various places left us with unforgettable impressions. The kind and familiar faces of Japanese friends seemed to be still in front of our eyes, and the loud voices of Japanese friends shouting "Long live peace and friendship" and singing "Tokyo-Beijing" were still echoing in our ears. Undoubtedly, the second visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan deepened the understanding between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and further promoted the friendship between the two peoples. The Chinese Red Cross is willing to continue to contribute its strength in this regard, and with joint efforts, greater development will surely be achieved in the future friendly relations between China and Japan.

    转达日本人民的深厚友谊
    ——中国红十字会代表团第二次访问日本的报告——
    李德全
    中国红十字会代表团自1954年11月访日以来，已经过了整整三个年头，在这三年中，中国红十字会本着人道精神，在中华人民共和国政府的大力支持下，和中国人民一起对于继续协助日本侨民回国，协助被宽大处理和释放的日本战犯回国，协助日本妇女回日本探亲，送还死亡在中国的日本人遗骨回日本，帮助调查日本人的消息等方面进行了不断的努力。这些工作，不仅日本各阶层人民对于中国红十字会和中国人民的巨大帮助表示十分感谢，并且进一步促进了中日两国人民的友好关系。与此同时，日本各方面的朋友，朝鲜朋友及华侨同胞，为了收集和送还中国烈士的遗骨，也继续作了重大的努力。到目前为止，已经送还到中国的烈士遗骨达二千七百二十四具。我们应当感谢日本人民在各种困难之下，进行了这项工作，这一事实也正表明了广大日本人民热爱和平以及要求中日友好的心情。1956年10月4日李德全会长致函中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会，表示中国红十字会希望派遣代表团再度访日，以便代表中国人民和烈士家属当面感谢日本人民为送还烈士遗骨所作的努力和追悼在日殉难烈士；同时也为了在加强中日两国人民的友谊方面作出新的贡献。1957年6月3日，经由日本七十多个民间团体组成的中国红十字会代表团欢迎委员会会长大谷莹润先生的正式邀请，又经日本各方面朋友的多次努力和敦促，终于实现了第二次的友好访问。
    中国红十字会代表团在团长李德全，副团长廖承志率领下，一行十三人在1957年12月2日离开北京，6日到达东京，27日结束了正式的访问日程，在1958年1月9日离开日本回国。
    这次在日本的三周访问期间，中国红十字会代表团访问了东京、札幌、小樽、函馆、青森、秋田、名古屋、岐阜、大阪、神户、奈良、京都、冈山、玉野、下关、门司、福冈、水户、日立、川崎、横滨等地方，比第一次访日时访问了更多的城市和乡村。接触到的各阶层人民也比上次广泛。为了欢迎中国红十字会代表团，在日本人民中掀起了规模巨大的全国性的群众运动。因此代表团每到一地，都受到广大群众的热情欢迎和亲切的接待。日本的朋友们说，代表团像一股暖流，无论到哪里，哪里就热起来。所有各地都举行了欢迎集会，车站、街头竖着大幅的欢迎标语塔和挂着大幅的横街标语，人们挥舞着中日两国的国旗和各团体各单位的旗帜，有的地方成千上万的群众在沿途夹道欢迎，妇女和儿童们穿着盛装送给代表团一束束鲜花，当穿过街道时，有的群众在楼上窗口散着彩色缤纷的纸花。扩音器播放着中国音乐，在群众的欢呼声中还夹着一声声爆竹，景象真如过节日一样。
    在抗日战争期间，日本帝国主义曾经劫走了成千上万的中国人，迫使他们在日本各地的矿山、港湾、工场从事重劳动，以致大批的中国人遭受虐杀或因劳动过重、营养不良而死去。这次代表团曾到了花冈惨案发生地——秋田县花矢町，也到了中国烈士殉难的许多地方。红十字会代表团以沉痛的心情在墓地悼念了中国烈士。自然，这些都已经成为过去，现在我们所看到的是和过去完全不同的另一种情景。当代表团到达花轮町，花矢町，尾去泽时，这些城镇的男女老少都手执中日两国的国旗，向代表团夹道欢呼，招手致意。家家户户悬挂着日本和中华人民共和国两国的国旗。他们像迎接最亲密的客人那样欢迎中国红十字会代表团。我们和日本朋友的谈话中，知道即使在最困难的年月里，当地居民对于中国人也是充满了同情心的，他们给了中国人食物和香烟，他们向中国烈士伸出友好的帮助的手。这些都使代表团深受感动。在那里我们也有机会同当时和中国烈士在一起劳动同甘共苦的朝鲜朋友见了面，他们和日本人民一道帮助了中国难友。特别是在战争结束后为了挖掘和送还在花冈牺牲的烈士遗骨，朝鲜朋友突破了种种阻挠，在十分困难的情况下进行了许多工作。我们对于当地朝鲜朋友、日本朋友以及在日本的华侨所作的这项友好和人道主义事业表示深切的谢意，在日本各地，我们听到日本人民为收集中国烈士遗骨，曾经花费了巨大的人力和物力。他们甚至把每一个烈士的姓名籍贯年龄死亡年月等材料都调查清楚。特别是工人、农民和佛教界人士对这项工作的努力协助最大。在北海道，我们知道室兰日本钢铁公司的工人们在坚持进行为时一年的反对解雇的罢工中，就曾连续三天进行了烈士遗骨的挖掘工作。在冈山县为了安葬经过一千多个和尚搜集的中国烈士遗骨，已经在玉野市观音院山上建筑了一座精致而又宏伟的中国烈士遗骨的聚灵堂。
    在访日的期间，各地日本朋友们和日本人民为了追悼战时在日本各地牺牲的中国烈士，曾经在东京、北海道、秋田、岐阜、大阪、神户、冈山、福冈、茨城等地分别举行了庄严而隆重的追悼仪式。在东京，有中国红十字会代表团欢迎委员会会长、中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会委员长大谷莹润，全日本佛教会会长高阶珑仙，恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章，日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎，日中文化交流协会会长片山哲，日中友好协会理事长内山完造，日本共产党中央委员会常委裤田里见、西泽隆二、日本工会总评议会常务干事冈本繁穗，日本国民救援会会长大山柳子以及各界代表约四百名参加了追悼会，在各地方的追悼会上，也都有当地的县知事、市长、议会议长以及各界代表和朋友们参加，他们代表日本人民对在日殉难的中国烈士表示哀悼，并向中国烈士的家属和中国人民表示道歉，他们在致悼词时一致强调指出：日本人民坚决反对战争，决不许再重复日本帝国主义过去所犯的错误，来依靠亚非和世界的持久和平。日本人民要求努力实现日中两国的友好关系，尽早恢复日中两国的邦交，以慰中国烈士的英灵。大谷莹润先生曾一再表示号召日本人民为了不重复日本过去犯过的错误，并且进一步争取和平和幸福，必须与中国人民携起手来共同努力，他说，这是一项实现亚非和世界和平的事业。在追悼会上，许多人表示今后愿继续收集和送还烈士遗骨的工作。据大谷莹润先生宣布，日本各地又收集了一百四十三具烈士遗骨，准备最近送还中国。中国红十字会代表团在各地举行的追悼会中，代表烈士家属和中国人民表示感谢，对于以大谷莹润为首的中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会诸位先生，各界朋友以及日本人民在这方面所进行的人道主义行动，是日本人民热爱和平反对战争，和中国人民友好的表现。中日两国两千年来传统的友好关系应该在新的平等互利的基础上迅速恢复，中日两国重新进入友好合作和平共处的新的历史阶段，使中日两国人民的世世代代子孙永远友好相处，不再遇到战争的灾害。只有这样，才能安慰牺牲了的烈士们和教育这一代的人们。代表团这次把中国红十字会根据日本访华代表团和日本人民提供的材料所找到的在中国死亡的日本人遗骨二千三百零六具的清单（其中有姓名的三十二名）交给了大谷莹润先生，并表示中国红十字会愿意继续协助调查，收集和送还日本人遗骨的工作。在这以前中国红十字会曾经把在云南、上海和东北等地找到的一百四十二具和十四匣日本人遗骨送还给了日本。
    在访问期间，代表团曾经举行了十五次记者招待会，参加在东京、大阪、函馆、秋田县花矢町、水户、冈山等地为代表团举行的欢迎群众大会，出席了六十多次欢迎酒会、宴会、茶会、游园会、座谈会等。代表团在东京还访问了中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会、日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会、日本国会参议院社会劳动委员会、恢复日中邦交国民会议和日本国民救援会等团体。日本众议院的各党派的议员们还特地举行了茶话会欢迎了代表团。代表团在很多的地方受到了县知事，县议会议长、市长、市议会议长等地方政府负责人的欢迎和热情接待。代表团在东京和所到过的地方都有了机会与政治、经济、文化艺术、学术、新闻、出版、医学、渔业、宗教等各界和青年、妇女、工会等团体的代表人物进行了接触，并在各地广泛的和日本人民见了面。
    我们很感谢以大谷莹润先生为首的中央的以及地方的中国红十字会代表团欢迎委员会各界先生和朋友的盛情、周到的接待和安排。在日本各地所进行的友好访问和广泛的接触，进一步加强了彼此之间的了解和增进了友谊。
    通过这次访问，我们深深地感到，由于近几年来中日两国人民的共同努力，中日两国人民的友好关系已经建立了起来，并且日益发展着。日本各阶层人士热望中日两国人民永远友好、和平相处，早日恢复邦交，并进一步进行经济、文化、技术等交流。这是任何外来力量都不能破坏或阻碍的。日本国会议员、前自由民主党副总干事筱田弘作在欢迎委员会举行的宴会上说：“日中两国的友好关系已经建立起来，成了血肉相连的关系。”日本国际贸易促进会会长山本熊一在经济界等举行的欢迎酒会上致词说：“全体日本国民以欢迎自己的母亲和兄弟般的心情来欢迎中国红十字会访日代表团的到来。”并表示：“日本制造商和经济界都热望日本与中国的邦交正常化，不但愿意从经济交流这方面来促使邦交的正常化，并且愿意更加加强文化等其他方面的交流来对亚洲和世界的和平作出贡献。”他还在会上表示相信在两国人民的努力下，一定在不久的将来将要签订第四次日中贸易协定。不久以前访问过中国的有田八郎先生曾经在一次欢迎午餐会上说：“日中两国邦交虽然没有恢复，但为恢复两国邦交的基础早已建立起来。”日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在日本国会议员举行的欢迎茶会上致词说：“今天能在日本国会内举行欢迎中国红十字会代表团的茶会，而众议院议长益谷秀次也参加了欢迎会，这个事实表明中日关系正在朝前迈进。”日共第一书记野坂参三在代表团东京临别酒会中说：“中国红十字会代表团再次访问日本的意义重大，它带来了中国人民的友谊，促进了两国友好关系的进一步发展。”代表团所接触过的日本地方政府负责人和所有的日本朋友一致表示中日两国传统的友好关系必须得到恢复。他们反对企图制造两个中国的阴谋，并表示愿克服一切困难来促使早日与中华人民共和国建立邦交。他们认为中国红十字会代表团的这次访问促进了两国关系的进一步发展。大阪欢迎委员会委员长小畑忠良在日本近畿二府五县各界代表和约一千五百人参加的欢迎群众大会上致词说：“当我们第一次在大阪欢迎中国红十字会代表团的时候，我们之间还不够完全了解，但是经过了三年之后，当今天我们再次欢迎你们的时候，这种情况完全改变了”。他还表示大阪人民相信在第三次欢迎中国红十字会代表团的时候，中日两国已经恢复了邦交。冈山市市长田渊久先生在冈山县各界举行的欢迎代表团的宴会上说：“冈山县从县知事到一百六十万县民只承认中华人民共和国政府，日中两国邦交一定要恢复。”这段话正是代表千百万日本人民的真诚愿望。
    代表团在各地受到了曾经侨居过中国的日本人的热烈欢迎。他们一再表示感谢中国人民和中国红十字会从1953年以来协助了近三万名在华日侨归国。这些回国日侨在各地和代表团见面时像见到亲人一样，他们有的还穿着旅居中国时候的衣服，有的说着流利的中国话并在继续学习中文。有的要求带信带东西给中国朋友。总之他们对新中国表示出强烈的友好和怀念的心情。代表团在各地也曾受到了被宽大处理与释放的日本战犯的热情欢迎，他们深深感谢中华人民共和国政府的宽大政策，自1956年以后释放了一千多名战争犯罪分子并且协助他们回国。代表团在各地都同被释战犯的代表和家属们见了面，参加过他们在东京举行的座谈会，有的从很远的地方赶来，介绍他的家人，送照片，有的流泪痛哭，他们表示对中国人民谢罪。他们表示只要活着，就要坚决为反对战争保卫和平的事业，贡献自己的一切，为中日两国的友好作最大的努力。各地的华侨和旅日朝鲜侨民也都特别热情的欢迎代表团，代表团也总是在百忙中给侨胞们介绍新中国建设的巨大成就，并勉励侨胞加强团结，热爱祖国，遵守居住国的法律，促进中日两国人民的友好关系。
    中国红十字会代表团表示回中国后一定要把日本各界朋友和日本人民对中国人民所表示的深厚的友谊转达给中国人民。代表团通过这次访日还把中国人民对日本人民的友好愿望转达给日本人民。代表团在各地的讲话中都指出中日两国有几千年的友好历史关系，只有最近短短的几十年有过不愉快的关系，但已经成为过去的事情了。在第二次世界大战以后，中国和日本都经历了很大的变化，解放了的中国人民现正在建设祖国的社会主义社会，日本人民则为和平和独立而进行斗争。由于中日两国人民所处的境遇有了变化，因此两国人民的感情也起了变化。代表团表达了中国人民对于日本人民今天的处境和日本人民所进行的斗争的同情和支持。代表团告诉日本人民，中国政府对日本所采取的友好合作，和平共处的政策是中国和平外交政策的重要部分，因为中国人民知道中日两国人民的友好不但符合两国人民的利益，而且也有利于亚洲和平和世界和平。代表团同时还指出目前的国际形势已经发生了根本的变化，和平的力量已经超过了战争的势力，东风压倒了西风，世界形势因而进入了新的转折点。一小撮好战分子的狂想更难实现了。代表团告诉他们说，这次访问日本以后深深感到日本人民要求中日友好和恢复两国邦交的呼声，比起三年以前更加普遍也更加发展了。在这样的基础上培植起来的中日人民友谊之树是任何台风也吹不倒的。代表团还给日本人民介绍了中国几年来建设的成就和远大计划的前景，并表示今后需要更加发展两国之间的经济、文化和技术上的交流。代表团告诉日本人民，尽管有些西方国家的执政者不喜欢并且不承认新中国，但是世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡六亿四千万中国人民前进的道路。代表团还多次强调了中国人民一定要解放台湾、反对任何制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋，阐明了我们的坚定立场。代表团在谈到上述问题时，都博得日本广大群众热烈的掌声和内心的共鸣。日本人民表示支持中国人民解放台湾的正义主张，同时代表团也表达了中国人民对于日本人民要求从美帝国主义占领下收回冲绳岛和小笠原群岛等斗争的支持。
    代表团在日本访问期间还和日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会等三团体进行了交谈，对有关问题交换了意见。代表团并且把根据历次日本人民来信所提供的和历次日本访华代表团带来的资料调查后已有结果的日本人名单八百八十名交给了日本三团体。在这以前，中国红十字会曾把二百八十六名在华日侨的消息通知了日本三团体和他们的家属。代表团在会谈中多次敦促日本三团体迅速派船来把准备回国的日侨和去年9月释放的日本战犯接回到日本去。代表团表示中国红十字会今后仍将对日侨回国和日本妇女回国探亲以及调查在华日本人消息等予以继续协助。
    代表团在访日期间还参观了大阪关西大学、大阪血库、京都立命馆大学、下关门司之间的海底公路、茨城县东海村原子能研究所，日立机器制作所，日本矿业日立矿山制炼所，东京开浓照相机工厂，中国研究所，姿姿化妆品工厂，福冈孤儿院，保姆训练所等单位。代表团还游览了日本的古都京都，奈良法隆寺，东大寺大佛殿，以及玉野、下关、沼津等地的水族馆，箱根风景区。日本人民在建设、科学、技术和文化领域方面显示了他们高度的智慧，我们对这些都感到钦佩。在参观中我们感到高兴的是，在奈良和茨城县太田市参拜了唐代鉴真和尚和明末中国学者朱舜水先生的墓地。中国人在一千多年前就和日本人民建立了深厚的友谊，这两位中国的先驱者为中日两国的友好作出了光辉的范例。
    当我们结束了在日本的访问回到中国的时候，对于日本人民在各地热烈欢迎代表团的动人情景，给了我们 难忘的印象，日本朋友们亲切而熟悉的面孔好像还在眼前，日本朋友们高呼和平友好万岁的响亮的声音，高唱“东京—北京”的歌声还在耳边震荡。通过第二次中国红十字会代表团的访日，无疑是加深了中日两国人民之间的了解，进一步促进了两国人民的友谊。中国红十字会愿在这方面继续贡献自己的力量，在共同的努力下，必将在今后的中日两国友好关系上取得更大的发展。
