Stand at the Forefront of the Anti-Waste Movement
　　Su Xing
    Currently, a high tide of special contention and rectification focusing on anti-waste is being launched throughout the country. Judging from the situation in many advanced regions and units that have already been mobilized, this anti-waste movement is indeed a raging fire, burning widely, deeply, and thoroughly. It is wide because whether it is industrial and mining enterprises, transportation departments, financial and trade departments, or cultural and educational departments, whether it is central or local, whether it is urban or rural, as long as there is waste, it will be burned. It is deep because for every agency, enterprise, and school, all waste phenomena in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources will be burned. It is thorough because this anti-waste campaign is taking advantage of the momentum of the rectification movement, igniting the fire of anti-waste, the mass movement is fierce and enthusiastic, and the leading cadres are determined to improve their work, so problems are easily solved.

    In the rectification phase of the rectification movement, why launch a large-scale anti-waste movement? Regarding this issue, it seems that most comrades can appreciate its great significance in economic and political terms and have adopted a supportive attitude. However, there are still a small number of comrades who do not fully understand its significance. Some are satisfied with existing achievements and feel that waste has been "almost" eliminated; some emphasize the particularity of their unit and feel that there is "little profit"; some still have concerns due to a lack of clear understanding of the purpose and policy boundaries of anti-waste. For these comrades, I feel it is still necessary to repeatedly explain the positive significance of the anti-waste struggle to encourage them to muster their fighting spirit and stand at the forefront of the movement.

    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "All cadres and all the people must be constantly reminded that our country is a large socialist country, but also a poor and economically backward country, which is a great contradiction. To make our country prosperous and strong, it will take decades of hard work, including the implementation of a policy of building the country industriously and thriftily and opposing waste." This statement is extremely profound. Our country is a large socialist country, and the needs in production and life are also large. To make our country a strong country with a modern industrial and agricultural base, so that 600 million people can live a prosperous and cultured life, there must be a leap in social production, which requires a large amount of capital. However, since we are a poor and economically backward country, capital accumulation is limited. Although the growth rate of our country's national income is very fast (an average annual increase of 9.8% from 1952 to 1956), the income level is very low. According to the National Bureau of Statistics: In 1956, the national income per capita in the country was only about 150 yuan (calculated at current prices). From 1953 to 1956, the national income increased by only about 9 yuan per capita per year (including the newly added population). This situation places great constraints on the increase of both accumulation funds and consumption funds. According to the current accumulation rate (22.5% in 1956) or even slightly higher than the current accumulation rate, the funds we can use for production are also limited in quantity. That is to say, there is a contradiction between the requirement to expand production and capital accumulation. In order to resolve this contradiction, we must proceed from the actual situation in our country, build the country industriously and thriftily, eliminate all waste, and save every penny for the cause of socialist construction.

    Recently, a large amount of waste has been exposed in various places and various aspects of the country. These phenomena are incompatible with our construction policy. For example, the Meilin Canned Food Factory wasted 450,000 yuan in four years, equivalent to half of its existing working capital; the North China Radio Equipment Factory has over 1 million yuan worth of stockpiled materials; and the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory caused a loss of 340,000 yuan to the state in 1957 from defective products alone. Not only industrial and mining enterprises, but also commerce, finance, culture, education, health, and other departments all have serious waste phenomena. According to preliminary calculations by the 13 companies under the four bureaus of the Shanghai commercial system, various wastes in the past two years amounted to 10.5 million yuan. Of course, some waste phenomena are indeed caused by our lack of experience, which is inevitable in a certain sense (learning experience and skills requires paying tuition). However, most waste phenomena are not due to a lack of experience, but because we do not consider the overall interests of the country and lack the idea of building the country industriously and thriftily. Some cadres still cannot fully appreciate the contradiction in socialist construction pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong above. They do not understand that the funds used for accumulation from our national income are only so much (basic construction investment in 1956 was about 14 billion yuan), and even if there is more, it cannot withstand arbitrary waste of 10 million here and 1 million there. It is very clear that if waste is not eliminated, the speed of socialist construction will be seriously affected.

    Eliminating waste, saving more funds, and building socialism is a matter of great significance. However, it cannot include the entire significance of the anti-waste struggle. Judging from the current situation of the anti-waste struggle, the problems exposed by the masses are quite extensive. In industrial and mining enterprises, it involves all aspects of basic construction, planning management, the use of funds (fixed assets and working capital), cost accounting, product quality, and work quotas; commercial departments involve all aspects of procurement, sales, business management, commodity storage, and allocation in the process of commodity circulation; cultural, educational, and health departments involve all aspects of basic construction, books, instruments, and so on. Since the problems are so widespread, we cannot but seriously consider what shortcomings and errors exist in our enterprises in formulating plans and managing business, leaving loopholes for the generation of waste? And how to try to plug these loopholes?

    Comrade Mao Zedong told us: Under certain conditions, bad things can also be transformed into good things. This can also be seen for waste. Wasting a lot of the country's manpower, material resources, and financial resources is a bad thing. However, if we are good at summing up experiences and lessons from the anti-waste struggle, leading the masses to thoroughly solve a number of key issues, eliminate waste, tap potential, and establish the spirit of building the country industriously and thriftily and running all undertakings industriously and thriftily, it will become a good thing. For example, in the anti-waste movement, the Beijing Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute adopted the method of exposing, inspecting, and correcting at the same time, and in just four days, it revised more than 100 engineering designs with excessively high standards and blindly pursuing architectural forms, saving the country more than 6 million yuan. What the Beijing Urban Planning Bureau Design Institute can do, why can't other enterprises, agencies, and schools do it?

    Take China's industrial enterprises as an example. Although many of our factories and mines have undergone democratic reforms and production reforms, and implemented the management methods of economic accounting systems, there are still many shortcomings and loopholes in many enterprises due to insufficient experience and serious bureaucracy of leading cadres. For example, how to arrange the rational possession and use of funds, how to calculate and reduce costs, how to stipulate and revise quotas, how to improve product quality and reduce defective products... and a series of other issues have not been well resolved to date. In this anti-waste struggle, these problems have been exposed, and many problems that have not been resolved for many years have also been raised. This forces us to analyze the situation, summarize experiences, tap potential, compare with the advanced, and seek solutions to problems. Now, a spirit of vigor can be seen in many enterprises, and they are combining the inspection of waste, plugging loopholes, revising the plan to increase production and practice economy, and improving business management methods. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.

    Of course, the full results of the anti-waste struggle for enterprise management cannot yet be fully seen. However, it can be affirmed that after this movement, the level of enterprise management will also appear a great leap forward, which is a struggle between the advanced and the backward, and also contains a struggle between the thrifty socialist management methods and the wasteful capitalist management methods. In this struggle, the advanced socialist principles of running all undertakings industriously and thriftily will surely win, thereby promoting the great development of socialist production.

    Opposing waste is not only of great significance in economic terms, but also of great significance in political terms.

    Waste is a characteristic of the capitalist system. Squandering and waste are also the consistent style of the bourgeoisie. Marx once pointed out that the luxury and waste of capitalists is "a part of the overhead costs of capital," which capitalists often use to show the huge profits and stable credit of their enterprises. Conversely, thrift is a feature of the socialist system, and diligence and thrift are the virtues of the working class. Waste and socialism are incompatible. As early as 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All government workers should understand that corruption and waste are extremely serious crimes." Because the socialist system is based on the public ownership of the means of production, everyone's attitude towards public property can show his attitude towards socialism. No matter who it is, if he does not cherish the public property that we have accumulated bit by bit, and arbitrarily squanders and wastes it, it should be regarded as a criminal act against the cause of social construction.

    Of course, as has been said before, waste phenomena should also be treated differently. Some waste phenomena should be attributed to a lack of experience. For these phenomena, lessons should be learned from them, and it is never too late to mend the fold and resolutely overcome them. In addition, many waste phenomena are caused by the love of pomp, extravagance, subjectivism, and bureaucracy in leadership, especially bureaucracy. For these sources of waste, a thorough ideological criticism must be carried out. Therefore, opposing waste is also a revolution on the political and ideological front, and an important part of the rectification movement.

    Is this good? Very good. This is a work of changing customs and habits. Through the opposition to waste, capitalist management ideas, the behavior of squandering public property, subjectivism and bureaucracy are criticized and resisted; socialist management ideas, cherishing public property, diligence and frugality will become a fashion. Everyone no longer compares in pomp and extravagance; on the contrary, they compare advanced indicators, compare savings, and compare vigor. In this way, the Party's policy of building the country industriously and thriftily, running enterprises industriously and thriftily, running cooperatives industriously and thriftily, running schools industriously and thriftily, running all undertakings industriously and thriftily, and managing families industriously and thriftily can be more thoroughly implemented. If this situation can be created, it shows that socialist ideology has won a decisive victory over capitalist ideology.

    Opposing waste is a long-term task. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Opposing waste, like criticizing other shortcomings and mistakes, is like washing your face." The face must be washed every day, but the current opportunity is very important. The current opposition to waste is already a magnificent mass movement, creating a vigorous high tide of rectification. In order to do this movement well and thoroughly, everyone who is loyal to the cause of socialist construction should stand at the forefront of the anti-waste movement.

　　站到反浪费运动的前面来
　　苏星
    目前，全国正掀起一个以反浪费为中心的专题鸣放和专题整改的高潮。从已经发动起来的许多先进地区和先进单位的情况来看，这次反浪费运动的确是一团烈火，烧的又广、又深、又透。说它广，是指不论工矿企业、交通运输部门、财政贸易部门和文化教育部门，不论中央和地方，不论城市和乡村，只要有浪费，都要烧到。说它深，是指对于每个机关、企业、学校，在人力、物力和财力各个方面所有的浪费现象，都要烧到。说它透，是指由于这次反浪费是乘整风运动之风，点起反浪费之火，群众运动的来势猛，热情高，领导干部改进工作的决心大，因此，问题易于得到解决。
    在整风运动的整改阶段，为什么要大张旗鼓地发动一个反浪费运动呢？对待这样一个问题，看来大多数同志都能够体会到它在经济上和政治上的重大意义，采取了促进的态度。但是，还有一小部分同志不完全了解它的意义，他们有的满于现有成绩，觉得浪费已经反的“差不多”了；有的强调本单位的特殊性，觉得“油水不大”；有的由于对反浪费的目的和政策界限认识不清，还有顾虑。对于这样一些同志，我感到还有必要反复说明反浪费斗争的积极意义，使他们鼓起斗志，站到运动的前面来。
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中曾经指出：“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”这段话是极其深刻的。我国是一个社会主义的大国，在生产和生活方面的需要也大。要使我国成为具有现代化工业和现代化的农业基础的强国，使六亿人口能够过富裕的有文化的生活，社会生产必须有一个飞跃的发展，这就需要大量的资金。但是，由于我们是一个经济落后的穷国，资金积累是有限度的。我国国民收入的增长速度虽然很快（1952年到1956年平均每年增长9.8％），收入水平却很低。根据国家统计局的资料：1956年全国每人平均的国民收入，只有一百五十元左右（按现价计算），从1953年到1956年，全国平均每人每年（包括新增加的人口在内）增加的国民收入只有九元左右。这种情况，对于积累基金和消费基金的增加，都存在着很大的约束。按照现在的积累率（1956年是22.5％）甚至稍高于现在的积累率来看，我们能够用在生产方面的资金，在数量上也是有限制的。这就是说，在扩大生产的要求和资金积累之间存在着矛盾。为了解决这个矛盾，必须从我国的实际出发，勤俭建国，杜绝一切浪费，节省出每一分钱来，用于社会主义建设事业。
    最近全国各个地方各个方面揭发出来了大量的浪费现象。这些现象和我们的建设方针是不能相容的。例如梅林罐头食品厂四年中就浪费了四十五万元，相当于现有流动资金的一半；华北无线电器材厂积压的物资价值一百多万元；长辛店机车车辆修理工厂1957年仅废品一项就为国家造成了三十四万元的损失。不仅工矿企业、商业、财政和文教卫生和其他部门，都存在着严重的浪费现象。上海市商业系统四个局所属的十三个公司的初步计算，两年来的各种浪费即达一千零五十万元之巨。当然，有一些浪费现象的确是由于我们缺乏经验所造成，这从一定的意义上说是难免的（学经验，学本事要花学费）。但是，多数浪费现象，并不是由于缺乏经验，而是由于不替国家算大账，缺乏勤俭建国的思想。有些干部还不能完全体会毛泽东同志在上面所指出的社会主义建设中的矛盾。他们不了解我国从国民收入当中用于积累的资金只有那末多（1956年的基本建设投资一百四十亿左右），而且即使再多，也架不住这里一千万，那里一百万地任意浪费。事情很清楚，如果不反掉浪费，社会主义建设的速度必然受到严重影响。
    反掉浪费，节约更多的资金，建设社会主义，这是一件有重大意义的事情。但是，还不能包括反浪费斗争的全部意义。从最近反浪费斗争的情况来看，群众揭发出来的问题是相当广泛的。在工矿企业中涉及到基本建设、计划管理、资金（固定资产和流动资金）运用、成本核算、产品质量、工时定额等各个方面；商业部门涉及到商品流转过程中进货、销货、经营管理、商品保管和调拨等各个方面；文教卫生部门涉及到基本建设、图书仪器等各个方面。问题既然这样广泛，我们就不能不认真地考虑一下，我们的企业在制定计划、经营管理方法各方面究竟存在着那些缺点和错误，为浪费现象的产生留下了漏洞？又怎样设法堵塞这些漏洞？
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：在一定的条件下，坏事也可以转变成为好事。对于浪费也可以这样看。浪费国家大量的人力、物力、财力，这是一件坏事。但是，如果我们善于从反浪费斗争中总结经验教训，领导同群众一起，彻底解决一批关键性的问题，杜绝浪费，挖掘潜力，树立起勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的精神，那就会变成好事。例如北京城市规划管理局设计院在反浪费运动中，采取边揭发、边检查、边改正的办法，在短短四天内，就修改了一百多项标准过高、盲目追求建筑形式的工程设计，为国家节省了六百多万元。北京市城市规划管理局设计院能够做到的事，别的企业、机关、学校为什么不可以做到呢？
    拿我国的工业企业作例子。我们的许多厂矿虽然经过了民主改革和生产改革，实行了经济核算制的管理方法。但是，在许多企业里，由于经验不足和领导干部的严重的官僚主义，缺点和漏洞还是很多的。比如关于怎样安排资金的合理占有和使用，怎样核算和降低成本，怎样规定和修改定额，怎样提高产品质量减少废品……等等一系列的问题，至今没有得到很好的解决。这次反浪费斗争当中，把这些问题都揭发出来了，其中许多多少年来没有解决的问题也提出来了。这样，就迫使我们分析情况，总结经验，挖潜力，比先进，寻求解决问题的办法。现在在许多企业已经可以看到一股干劲，他们正结合检查浪费，杜绝漏洞，修定增产节约计划，改进经营管理方法。这是一种十分可喜的现象。
    当然，反浪费斗争对于企业经营管理所带来的全部结果，现在还不能完全看到。不过，可以肯定的说，经过这次运动，企业的经营管理水平也将会出现一个大跃进，这是先进同落后之间的斗争，同时也包含着克勤克俭的社会主义经营管理方法同浪费挥霍的资本主义经营管理方法之间的斗争。在这个斗争中先进的勤俭办一切事业的社会主义原则一定会获得胜利，从而促进社会主义生产的大发展。
    反对浪费，不但在经济上有重大意义，在政治上也有重大意义。
    浪费，这是资本主义制度的特征。挥霍、浪费，也是资产阶级的一贯作风。马克思曾经指出：资本家的奢侈、浪费，是“资本的场面费用的一部分”，资本家经常用它来显示自己企业利润的庞大和信用的稳固。相反的，节约却是社会主
  义制度的特征、勤劳节俭是工人阶级的美德。浪费和社会主义是不能相容的。毛泽东同志远在1943年就说过：“应该使一切政府工作人员明白，贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。”因为，社会主义制度是以生产资料公有制为基础的，每个人对待公有财产的态度，就可以表明他对待社会主义的态度。不论是谁，如果对于我们一点一滴地积累起来的公共财产，毫不心疼，任意挥霍、浪费，就应当把它看做是对社会建设事业的一种犯罪行为。
    当然，前面已经说过，对于浪费现象也应当区别对待。有些浪费现象要记在经验不足的账上，对于这些现象，要从中吸取教训，亡羊补牢，坚决克服。此外许多浪费现象则是由于爱排场、摆阔气，领导上的主观主义、官僚主义，特别是官僚主义所造成的。对于这些浪费的根源，必须从思想上进行彻底的批判。因此，反对浪费，同时就是政治思想战线上的革命，是整风运动的重要组成部分。
    这样做好不好呢？很好。这是一种移风易俗的工作。经过反对浪费，资本主义经营思想、挥霍公共财产的行为、主观主义和官僚主义受到批判和抵制；社会主义经营思想、爱护公共财产、勤俭朴素将成为一种风尚。大家不再比排场、比阔气了，相反的，要比先进指标、比节省、比干劲。这样，才能够更彻底地贯彻党所提出来的勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办学校、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的方针。能造成这种局面，就表明社会主义思想对于资本主义思想取得了决定性的胜利。
    反对浪费，是一项持久的工作。正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“反对浪费，同批判其他缺点错误一样，好比洗脸。”脸是天天都要洗的，不过，目前的时机非常重要。现在的反对浪费已经是一个波澜壮阔的群众运动，造成了轰轰烈烈的整改高潮，为了把这次运动搞好，搞透，一切忠实于社会主义建设事业的人，都应当站到反浪费运动的最前列来。
