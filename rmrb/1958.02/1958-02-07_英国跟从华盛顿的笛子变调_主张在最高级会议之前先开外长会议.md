Xinhua News Agency, London, February 6th. A British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement on the 5th, emphasizing the need for a foreign ministers' meeting before holding an East-West summit, and stating that there was "no disagreement" between Britain and the United States on the method of preparing for the summit. The Foreign Office's statement reinforces the view that Washington's pressure has had an effect on Whitehall officials.

While making the above statement, the British Foreign Office spokesman also attempted to deny differences of opinion within the British government regarding the convening of a summit. However, it was noted that just a few days earlier, Prime Minister Macmillan, on a tour of the Commonwealth, and Deputy Prime Minister Butler in London, had both stated that they would not be too rigid about the exact methods and procedures for preparing for the summit. Reporters attending the reception asked for an explanation of these contradictory statements made by British cabinet members and the Foreign Office regarding the preparation of the summit. Although the Foreign Office spokesman tried to answer vaguely, he still seemed very embarrassed.

Reuters, in reporting on Britain's attitude, pointed out that Britain has "taken a step back and switched to supporting the US attitude," which is to demand a foreign ministers' meeting before holding a summit, even though this proposal to delay the summit has been rejected by the Soviet Union. According to Reuters reporters, the change in the British Foreign Office's view occurred after a secret meeting last week between British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and US Secretary of State Dulles.

### 英国跟从华盛顿的笛子变调  主张在最高级会议之前先开外长会议

　　英国跟从华盛顿的笛子变调
    主张在最高级会议之前先开外长会议
    新华社伦敦6日电　英国外交部发言人5日发表声明，强调先要举行外长会议然后再召开东西方最高级会议，并且表示英美两国在最高级会议的准备方法的问题上“并没有分歧”。外交部的这个声明加强了人们的这种看法：华盛顿的压力已经对白厅官员们发生了作用。
    英国外交部发言人在作出上述声明的同时，还企图否认英国政府内部在关于召开最高级会议问题上有分歧的意见。但是人们注意到，只是在几天以前，在访问英联邦的旅程中的首相麦克米伦和在伦敦的代理首相巴特勒都曾经表示，他们对于准备最高级会议的确切方法和程序不会太死板。出席招待会的记者们要求解释英国内阁阁员们和外交部在最高级会议的准备的问题上先后发表的这些互相矛盾的谈话，外交部发言人虽然在答复中竭力说得含糊其辞，但是仍然显得非常尴尬。
    路透社在报道英国的态度时指出，英国已经“后退一步，转为支持美国的态度”，这就是在举行最高级会议以前要求先召开外长会议，虽然这种拖延最高级会议的主张已经为苏联所拒绝。据路透社记者说，英国外交部看法的改变是在上星期英国外交大臣劳埃德和美国国务卿杜勒斯举行秘密会议以后发生的。
