　　Shanxi Rehabilitates the "Three Treasures"

    (Our report) The Shanxi Daily published a front-page headline on February 4th featuring a statement by the head of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction, affirming the correctness of promoting the Jin Huanghou (Golden Queen) corn, expanding the area of multiple cropping, and promoting the Xinjiang cotton planting experience. On the same day, the newspaper published an editorial entitled "Rehabilitating the Three Treasures," criticizing some people for their incomplete views, insufficient enthusiasm for promoting advanced experiences, and lack of technical understanding and adherence to the mass line, which caused them to lose their way when the "small typhoon" blew in.

    The news stated: In Shanxi Province, after the autumn of 1956, a wind swept through, saying things like "Jin Huanghou doesn't tassel," "If it falls in autumn, it falls in summer; two crops are not as good as one," "Nine earlies, three mores, one late, cotton grows into bare stalks," and so on. Afterwards, people called this the "Jin Huanghou Incident," the "Multiple Cropping Incident," and the "Nine Earlies, Three Mores, One Late Incident." As a result, in 1957, the corn planting area in the province decreased from 9.16 million mu in 1956 to 6.52 million mu; the multiple cropping index dropped from 10.2% in 1956 to 7.7%; and effective yield-increasing experiences such as dense planting of cotton and the selection of superior seeds were no longer promoted, leaving farmers to "volunteer."

    "Jin Huanghou" is a High-Yielding Crop

    Why did the "Jin Huanghou Incident" occur? The news stated: In the late summer and early autumn of that year, just as the "Jin Huanghou" was tasseling and flowering, unfortunately, rain followed rain, the sun disappeared, the temperature turned cold, and early frost followed, causing some corn not to tassel or to tassel without setting seeds. Therefore, the saying "Jin Huanghou doesn't tassel" quickly spread throughout the province. Complaints and accusations came from all directions, directed at agricultural technical cadres. The fact that things got so big was, of course, related to the subjective and bureaucratic work style of the agricultural leadership. For example, some areas with high altitudes and cold climates were not suitable for "Jin Huanghou" to grow, but they were still allowed to promote it. In addition, individual areas rigidly stipulated tasks, without consulting with the masses, violating the principle of adapting to local conditions, and technical guidance did not keep up, etc. These objective and subjective conditions combined to cause a serious reduction in production of more than 200,000 mu of Jin Huanghou corn.

    However, the direction of promoting high-yield crops is correct, and the increase in production of "Jin Huanghou" is the basic situation; the reduction in production is, after all, in the extreme minority. The corn that did not tassel or whose tassels did not mature accounted for only about 2% of the total corn area. Therefore, "Jin Huanghou" is definitely a high-yield crop and must be appropriately expanded in the future.

    Area of Multiple Cropping Needs to be Expanded

    When talking about the issue of multiple cropping, the news believes that, from the perspective of the climate conditions of Shanxi Province, most areas of southern Shanxi, central Shanxi, and southeastern Shanxi, and part of eastern Shanxi, can implement a two-crop-a-year system; and a large part of the area can implement a three-crop-in-two-years system. Fully utilizing climate conditions and increasing the area of multiple cropping is one of the effective measures to increase the yield per unit area and achieve a great leap forward in agriculture. The argument that "two crops are not as good as one" is actually a reflection of conservative thinking. 1956 was precisely a year of significant increase in grain production in Shanxi Province, with the total grain output of the province reaching 8.67 billion jin, which was 30 million jin more than the bumper year of 1953. This is inseparable from the active expansion of high-yield crops and the increase in the multiple cropping index. Most of the "thousand-jin cooperatives" and high-yield villages in Shanxi Province are cooperatives or villages that have done a good job of two crops a year or even three crops a year.

    Judging from the experience of the past few years, multiple cropping must have certain conditions, that is, there must be fertilizer, water, labor, and suitable seeds. In a few areas, the increase in production from multiple cropping is not significant, and individual areas even reduce production. This is not because multiple cropping cannot increase production, but because the necessary preparatory work for multiple cropping has not been done well. In the high tide of production and construction, a large amount of water can be found; fertilizer accumulation can also be doubled; and labor can also be solved as long as it is arranged reasonably. Therefore, the news writes that striving to increase the multiple cropping index of the province to 20% in the next few years should become a direction for the people of Shanxi to strive for.

    Xinjiang Cotton Planting Experience Should Continue to be Promoted

    The news stated that the main reasons for the decline in cotton production in some areas of Shanxi Province in 1956 were heavy rain, abundant weeds, many insects, little sunshine, and low temperature, and no emergency measures were taken to adapt to the harsh climate. It was by no means due to the promotion of Xinjiang's "Nine Earlies, Three Mores, One Late" cotton planting experience. According to a survey of 21 agricultural cooperatives, including the Tuanjie Cooperative in Anju Township, Quwo County, the Wuyi Cooperative in Yongji, and the Liaoyuan Cooperative in Jieyu, they implemented the Xinjiang cotton planting experience in accordance with local conditions. On more than 13,000 mu of cotton fields, cotton production not only exceeded 1955, but also exceeded the bumper year of 1954. In particular, in 1957, Shanxi Province had 270,000 mu of cotton fields with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and 21 "100-jin cotton cooperatives" appeared, mainly due to the reasonable implementation of the "Nine Earlies, Three Mores, One Late" cotton planting experience. In this year, the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station developed the "Nine Earlies, Three Mores, One Late" cotton planting experience in accordance with local conditions on 200 mu of dryland cotton fields, with a yield of 180 jin and 15 liang of ginned cotton per mu. Facts have proved that by promoting the "Nine Earlies, Three Mores, One Late" cotton planting experience in accordance with local conditions, and constantly developing and enriching it in practice, cotton production can be significantly increased.

    The news concludes: "Promoting 'Jin Huanghou' corn, expanding the area of multiple cropping, and promoting the Xinjiang cotton planting experience are the three treasures of the great leap forward in agriculture in Shanxi Province, which must be firmly grasped and not lost."

### 山西为“三宝”恢复名誉

　　山西为“三宝”恢复名誉
    本报讯　山西日报在2月4日以一版头条地位刊载了山西省农业建设厅负责人发表谈话的消息，肯定推广金皇后玉米、扩大复种面积、推广新疆植棉经验的正确性。同一天，报纸以“为三宝恢复名誉”为题发表社论，批判一些人看问题不全面、推广先进经验劲头不足，再加上不懂技术、不走群众路线，因而在“小台风”刮来时迷失了方向。
    消息说：山西省在1956年秋后，曾相当普遍的刮起一股风，说什么“金皇后不出穗”，“秋倒夏，夏倒秋，两料不如一料收”，“九早三多一晚，棉花长成光秆”等等。事后，人们把这叫成“金皇后事件”、“复播事件”和“九早三多一晚事件”。由于这样，全省在1957年，玉米播种面积由1956年的九百一十六万亩，缩减到六百五十二万亩；复播指数由1956年的10.2％，下降为7.7％；而棉花密植和选用优种等行之有效的增产经验，也不再提倡了，听凭农民“自愿”。
    “金皇后”是高产作物
    为什么会闹起“金皇后事件”呢？消息说：那年夏末秋初，正当“金皇后”吐穗扬花的时候，不幸大雨一场接一场，阳光不见了，气温变冷了，早霜接踵而至，造成一部分玉米没有吐穗或吐穗不结籽。于是“金皇后不出穗”之说，迅速传遍全省。埋怨、责备，便从四面八方压到农业技术干部头上来。事情会闹得这么大，当然跟农业领导机关的主观主义工作作风有关。如某些地高气候冷的地区，本来不适宜“金皇后”生长，但也准许推广了。还有个别地区硬性规定任务，不和群众商量，违犯了因地制宜原则，技术指导也没跟上，等等。这些主客观条件合在一起，致使二十万多亩金皇后玉米严重减产。
    但是，推广高产作物的方向是对的，“金皇后”增产是基本的情况，减产毕竟是极少数。不出穗或出穗未成熟的，仅占玉米总面积的2％左右。所以，“金皇后”肯定是一种高产作物，今后必须坚持适当的扩大。
    复种面积需要扩大
    在谈到复种问题时，消息认为，从山西省气候条件来说，晋南、晋中、晋东南的大部分地区，晋东的一部分地区，都可以实行一年两作制；还有很大一部分地区，可以实行二年三作制。充分利用气候条件，增加复播面积，是提高单位面积产量，实现农业大跃进的有效措施之一。“两料不如一料收”的论调，其实是保守主义思想的反映。1956年，正是山西省粮食产量显著提高的一年，全省粮食总产量达八十六点七亿斤，比丰收的1953年还多三千万斤。这同积极扩大高产作物和提高复播指数是分不开的。山西省出现的“千斤社”和高额丰产乡，大部分都是一年两作甚至一年三作搞得好的社或乡。
    从几年来的经验来看，复播要有一定条件，这就是要有肥、有水、有劳力、有适宜的种籽。少数地区复播增产不显著，个别的甚至减产，这不是复播不能增产，而是没有做好复播应有的准备工作。在生产建设高潮中，水能大量的找到；积肥也能办到翻一翻；而劳力只要合理安排，也是能够解决的。因此消息写道，争取在今后几年内，全省复播指数提高到20％，这应该成为山西人民一个奋斗的方向。
    新疆植棉经验应继续推广
    消息说，1956年山西省部分地区棉花减产主要原因是，雨大、草多、虫多、日照少、温度低，没采取适应恶劣气候的紧急措施，绝不是由于推广了新疆的
  “九早、三多、一晚”植棉经验。据曲沃县安居乡团结社、永济五一社、解虞燎原社等二十一个农业社调查，他们因地制宜地贯彻了新疆植棉经验，在一万三千多亩棉田上，棉花产量不仅超过1955年，而且超过丰收的1954年。特别是1957年，山西省有二十七万亩棉田亩产皮棉一百斤，出现了二十一个“百斤棉社”，主要是由于合理地贯彻“九早、三多、一晚”植棉经验的结果。这一年，运城农业试验站在二百亩旱地棉田上，因地制宜发展了“九早、三多、一晚”植棉经验，亩产皮棉达一百八十斤十五两。事实证明，因地制宜地推广“九早、三多、一晚”植棉经验，并在实践中不断发展它、充实它，棉花产量就能显著提高。
    消息最后说：“推广‘金皇后’玉茭、扩大复播面积、推广新疆植棉经验，这是山西省农业大跃进的三件宝，要紧紧抓住，不能丢掉。”
