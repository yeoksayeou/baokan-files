Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Nearly two thousand students from the Beijing Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School, taking advantage of their winter vacation from February 1st to 12th, brought their own tools to Qinghe Town in Haidian District to participate in voluntary labor for water conservancy construction, contributing to the great leap forward in the motherland's agriculture.

For twelve days, these returned overseas Chinese students, mostly from Southeast Asian regions where summer lasts all year round, worked with great enthusiasm under the slogan "Not afraid of the freezing cold, everything for water conservancy," excavating over 4,700 cubic meters of earth, completing their task three days ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota by 100%. The Qinghe Town agricultural cooperative specially presented them with a silk banner to commend their patriotic enthusiasm and labor achievements.

In this group of returned overseas Chinese students, almost no one had participated in physical labor before. Now, many students have expressed that if they do not pass the entrance exams for schools this summer, they are willing to participate in agricultural production and become the first generation of educated farmers. They believe that participating in agricultural production is also a glorious path for returned overseas Chinese students.

    北京市近两千名华侨学生
    寒假参加水利建设
    新华社14日讯　北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校的近两千名学生，从1日到12日，利用寒假，自带工具到海淀区清河镇参加兴修水利的义务劳动，为祖国农业大跃进出一份力量。
    十二天来，这些绝大多数来自长年皆夏的东南亚各地的归国华侨学生们，在“天寒地冻都不怕，一切为了水利化”的口号下，干劲十足，一共挖出四千七百多土方，提前三天并超额一倍完成任务。清河镇农业社为表彰他们的爱国热情和劳动功绩，特地赠给他们一面锦旗。
    在这批归国华侨学生中，过去几乎没有人参加过体力劳动。现在，许多学生都表示如果今年暑假考不上学校，愿意参加农业生产，做第一代有文化的农民。他们认为，参加农业生产，对于归国华侨学生同样是一条光荣的道路。
