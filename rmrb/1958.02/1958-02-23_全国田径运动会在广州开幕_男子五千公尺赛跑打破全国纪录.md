The first national track and field competition of the year – the 1958 National Spring Track and Field Championships – opened on February 22nd at the Yuexiu Mountain Stadium in Guangzhou. In the two finals held after the opening ceremony, one event – the men's 5,000-meter race – broke the national record.

The first person to break a national record this year was Huang Zhiyong, a long-distance runner from the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Today, in the men's 5,000-meter final, he finished the entire race first with a time of 15 minutes 6.8 seconds. This new national achievement not only broke the 1957 national record of 15 minutes 9.6 seconds, but also improved upon his own time of 15 minutes 7.7 seconds, which he set in January of this year.

A total of twenty-five athletes participated in the men's 5,000-meter final. The second place finisher was Su Wenren, a twenty-two-year-old railway worker from Kunming, with a time of 15 minutes 19.2 seconds.
