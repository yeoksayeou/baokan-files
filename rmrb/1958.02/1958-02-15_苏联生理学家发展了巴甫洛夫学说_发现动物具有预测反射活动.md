Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from Moscow: According to TASS, Soviet physiologist and Moscow University professor L. Krushinsky, after long-term research and experiments on animal reflex activity, concluded that in addition to the conditioned and unconditioned reflexes discovered by Pavlov, animals also possess a third type of reflex – the predictive reflex (or extrapolation reflex). This type of reflex is based on intellectual activity. Higher animals have the ability to imagine the development process of things, compare individual phenomena, and foresee the arrival of future events. These predictions are understood through the sensory organs.

Krushinsky determined that certain types of animals and birds have varying degrees of extrapolation reflexes, which are directly related to their living conditions. The reflexes discovered by Krushinsky are innate, but they can only appear after certain animals have accumulated the necessary experience. The prerequisite for extrapolation reflexes is a specialized nerve organ in the cerebral cortex – "operational memory," which can identify and determine the changing rules of certain factors, especially the direction and speed of movement. Knowing these regularities allows one to foresee future changes and react accordingly. It can be seen that this new type of reflex is different from conditioned and unconditioned reflexes, and is not a direct response to stimuli that are currently in effect. In addition, the new type of reflex may also have a certain antagonism with conditioned reflexes, because the latter is more or less based on some imitation activities.

As the degree of development of the extrapolation reflex increases, animals will be able to solve various complex tasks. Experience shows that forcing animals to solve tasks that they are not capable of can disrupt their nerve activity and lead to illness. It is reasonable to speculate that this disruption can also occur in humans. The result of excessive tension in extrapolation reflex activity may be diseases of people's nerve organs. Professor Krushinsky believes that recognizing new reflexes gives people new weapons in the fight against nervous system diseases.

Doctor of Biology and Soviet representative to the "International Biologists Association," Radikina-Kots, told a TASS reporter that Professor Krushinsky's research has great scientific and practical significance. Professor Krushinsky has proposed a new, very clever, and extremely simple method for studying animal behavior, and has positively solved the long-debated question of whether animals have concepts. The new type of reflex allows us to determine the physiological processes that serve as the basis for retaining stimulus traces, that is, the emergence of concepts. Concepts are the basis for animals to form thought processes and the basis for the ability to "foresee" actions. We are faced with the prospect of cultivating animal breeds with more complete extrapolation reflex activity systems.

The famous mathematician and leader of research work in cybernetics, Professor Lyapunov, said that Krushinsky's discovery is not only important for physiologists and psychologists, but also for mathematicians. Understanding the process of animal extrapolation makes it possible for mathematicians to solve important problems in cybernetics with a new attitude. Studying the extrapolation process will help establish systems that can make predictions in areas that the human brain cannot reach. We plan to establish a specialized cybernetics-physiology laboratory at Moscow University soon.

    苏联生理学家发展了巴甫洛夫学说
    发现动物具有预测反射活动
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联生理学家、莫斯科大学教授列·克鲁辛斯基经过长期的对动物的反射活动的研究和实验后得出结论说：动物除了巴甫洛夫所发现的条件反射和无条件反射以外，还有第三种反射——预测反射（或称外推反射）。这种类型的反射是以智力活动为基础的。高级动物有想像事物发展过程、比较个别现象和预见未来事件的到来的能力。这些预测都是通过感觉器官来领会的。
    克鲁辛斯基确定，某些种类的动物和飞禽具有不同程度的外推反射，这同它们的生活条件有直接关系。克鲁辛斯基所发现的反射是先天性的，但是，只有当某些动物积累了必须的经验以后这种反射才能出现。外推反射的前提是在大脑皮质中有一专门的神经器官——“操作记忆”，这种记忆能够查明和确定某些因素的变化规律，特别是运动的方向和速度。知晓这些规律性就可以预见今后的变化并发生相应的反应。由此可见，这种新类型的反射同条件反射和无条件反射不同，不是对当时起作用的刺激物的直接反应。此外，新类型反射还可能同条件反射有一定对抗，因为后者是或多或少地以一些模仿活动为基础。
    随着外推反射发展的程度，动物将能解决各种复杂的任务。经验表明，强使动物解决它力不胜任的任务，会破坏它的神经活动和导致生病。有根据推测，这种破坏也会出现在人的身上。外推反射活动过度紧张的结果，可能就是人们的神经器官病。克鲁辛斯基教授认为，认识新的反射使人们在同神经系统疾病进行斗争时有了新的武器。
    生物学博士、苏联驻“国际生物学家协会”代表拉迪基娜—科茨对塔斯社记者说，克鲁辛斯基教授的研究有着巨大的科学和实际意义。克鲁辛斯基教授提出了一个新的、十分聪明、而又极其简单的研究动物行为的方法，并且肯定地解决了动物是否有概念这个一直在争论的问题。新类型反射使我们可能确定作为保留刺激痕迹、即出现概念的基础的生理过程。概念是动物形成思维过程的基础，是“预见”行动的能力的基础。在我们面前出现了一个可能培养出外推反射活动系统较完善的动物品种的远景。
    著名的数学家、控制论方面研究工作的领导人佳普诺夫教授说，克鲁辛斯基的发现不仅对生理学家和心理学家很重要，对数学家也同样重要。了解动物外推作用过程使数学家有可能以新的态度解决控制论方面的重要问题。研究外推作用过程有助于建立能够在人脑所达不到的范围内进行预见的系统。我们打算最近在莫斯科大学建立一个专门的控制论—生理学实验室。
