    Are Increased Production Measures and Leap Forward Targets Compatible?
    Pre-spring Plowing Inspection is Imminent
    Hunan Province Will Launch Mass Discussion to Ensure Plans are Rooted and Take Hold
    Zhejiang Province's Huangyan County Burns the Bad Habit of "Only Talking, Not Doing"
    Changsha, February 27th (Our Reporter Huang Yubai) -- The Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a telephone conference of county party secretaries held on the evening of February 24th, instructed all localities to combine production with the method of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate, to boldly mobilize the masses to comprehensively inspect and discuss this year's Leap Forward plan and measures, and to do a good job in all pre-spring plowing preparations in order to quickly greet and organize an even greater high tide of spring plowing production this year.
    The Provincial Party Committee believes that what should be seen first and foremost is that the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the province's farmers are unprecedentedly high, but specifically in terms of achieving this year's agricultural production Great Leap Forward targets and measures, the ideological understanding of the broad masses is still uneven. The majority of the masses have shown increasing enthusiasm in multiple revisions of production plans, but some of the masses still have doubts and lack confidence in the Great Leap Forward targets and measures. This contradiction between advanced increased production targets and measures and the masses' temporarily not fully adapted thinking is the main problem brought about by the new situation of the Great Leap Forward on the agricultural front. The solution to this contradiction must be to use the method of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate, to boldly mobilize the masses, and to conduct a comprehensive inspection and discussion of this year's Leap Forward targets and measures. Through inspection and discussion, this year's Leap Forward plan will take root and take hold among the broad masses, and the Leap Forward plan and measures will become a material force that inspires and encourages the masses to move forward, so as to further improve all pre-spring plowing work.
    In order to do a good job in this inspection and discussion, the Provincial Party Committee criticized the tendency of some cadres to not dare to boldly mobilize the masses to debate the plan, measures, and the entire pre-spring plowing work, believing that this is a new right-leaning conservative thought in leadership ideology. They do not see the great potential of the masses, underestimate the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses, and attempt to replace ideological mobilization with administrative orders. This idea is harmful. Facts have proven that boldly mobilizing the masses and using the method of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate to inspect plans and measures results in the masses becoming more and more enthusiastic. Many places have reported that the more they debate, the more they feel the potential is great, the more they feel there are many methods, and the more they feel the Great Leap Forward is completely possible.
    The Provincial Party Committee requires leading cadres at all levels to continue to go deep, cultivate experimental fields, grasp typical examples, and find experience and laws so that the upcoming spring plowing production high tide can be organized even better.
    (Our Dispatch) According to Zhejiang Daily: Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, through inspecting the Leap Forward measures in pre-spring plowing production, burned the style of only talking and not doing, and overcame the complacency and paralysis of cadres. Now, throughout the county, between districts, townships, cooperatives, and teams, a mass inspection of increased production targets and measures is being further carried out from top to bottom and from bottom to top, striving to ensure that this year's spring plowing preparations truly meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward.
    Not long ago, the responsible persons of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Huangyan County Party Committee jointly inspected the measures and current pre-spring plowing work of the Luqiao No. 1 Cooperative and the Shipu Cooperative of Mapu Township for achieving the 1958 increased production targets, and found that the increased production measures of many cooperatives were not compatible with the targets. For example, although the increased production measures of the Shipu Cooperative in Mapu Township were relatively specific, many increased production measures were not consistent with what was said and what was done. The plan was to harvest 800 jin per mu in the early rice season, and the measure was to promote improved varieties, but on the signs planted in the fields, there were still many early rice plants of the "503" variety. "503" is a backward early rice variety in Huangyan, and at best can only yield 500 jin per mu. Therefore, the plan to harvest 700 jin, 800 jin, or 850 jin per mu in the early rice season was not prepared for in terms of seeds. The cooperative director said that pest control work had been done; after inspection, the rice roots in the red clover fields had not been removed, and some of the rice roots had two or three rice stem borers in each clump. The Luqiao No. 1 Cooperative's output last year was 1,081 jin, and the plan for this year is 1,550 jin, but there are low-yield fields in the high-yield team. There was a problem with fertilization of early rice last year, and there was a lot of lodging. They did not know the reason for the lodging. It is also unclear which aspects to focus on in this year's increased production efforts.
    If these problems exist in these two first-type cooperatives, do these situations also exist in other areas of the county? After conducting a comparative inspection among cadres in the county's districts and townships, many problems that had not been thought of before were revealed. The Tongyu and Yuanqiao districts planned to carry 150 to 200 dan of pond mud per mu to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, but before the Spring Festival, the average was only 60 to 70 dan per mu, less than half of the plan. After the secretary of the Yuanqiao District Committee discovered these problems, he was so anxious that he stayed up all night, criticizing the past complacency and the generalized style of leadership. Inspections in Xinqiao, Tongyu, and other districts found that many township and cooperative cadres held a passive attitude of ordering the targets like this, but doing as much as they could in action.
    At a county-wide conference of district and township cadres recently convened by the County Party Committee, a serious criticism was made of that kind of complacent, paralyzed thinking and the idea of only talking and not doing. Among the county, district, and township cadres, the "fire of generalized leadership style" and "fire of only talking and not doing" were ignited, and mutual criticism and self-criticism were carried out.

### 看增产措施和跃进指标是否适应？  备耕大检查刻不容缓

    看增产措施和跃进指标是否适应？
    备耕大检查刻不容缓
    湖南省将发动群众辩论使计划落脚生根
    浙江省黄岩县火烧“只说不做”的坏作风
    本报长沙27日电　记者黄驭白报道：中共湖南省委在2月24日晚召开的全省县委书记电话会议上，指示各地结合生产，用大鸣大放大争的方法，放手发动群众，全面检查和讨论一次今年的跃进计划和措施，做好各项备耕工作，以便迅速迎接和组织今年春耕生产的更大高潮。
    省委认为：当前应该首先看到的是，全省农民的政治觉悟与生产积极性空前高涨，但是具体到实现今年农业生产大跃进的指标和措施上，广大群众的思想认识水平还是不平衡的。大部分群众在多次修订生产计划中表现干劲越来越大，但是有一部分群众对大跃进的指标和措施还有疑虑，信心不足。这种先进的增产指标和措施与群众暂时还不完全相适应的思想状况的矛盾，就是农业战线出现大跃进的新形势以后所带来的主要问题。解决这个矛盾的办法，必须用大鸣大放大争的方法，放手发动群众，将今年的跃进指标和措施进行一次全面的检查和讨论。通过检查讨论，使今年的跃进计划在广大群众中落脚生根，使跃进计划和措施成为激发和鼓励群众前进的物质力量，以便进一步做好各项备耕工作。
    为了搞好这次检查和讨论，省委批评了有些干部不敢放手发动群众辩论计划、措施和整个备耕工作的倾向，认为这是一种领导思想上的新的右倾保守思想。他们看不见群众的伟大潜力，对广大群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性估计不足，企图用行政命令去代替思想发动，这种想法是有害的。事实证明：放手发动群众，用大鸣大放大争的方法检查计划和措施的结果，是群众的干劲越来越大。许多地方都反映：越辩论，越觉得潜力大，越觉得办法多，越觉得大跃进完全可能。
    省委要求各级领导干部继续深入下去，搞试验田，抓典型，摸出经验和规律，使即将到来的春耕生产高潮组织得更好。
    本报讯　浙江日报消息：浙江省黄岩县通过检查备耕生产中的跃进措施，火烧只说不做的作风，克服了干部的自满麻痹思想。现在全县的区与区、乡与乡、社与社、队与队之间，正在进一步开展自上而下和自下而上的群众性的检查增产指标和增产措施，力争今年的春耕准备切实符合大跃进的要求。
    不久以前，中共浙江省委和黄岩县委的负责人，一起检查了黄岩县路桥一社、马铺乡石硑社实现1958年增产指标的措施和当前的备耕工作，发现不少合作社增产措施与指标不相适应。如马铺乡石硑社增产措施虽然比较具体，但是好些增产措施讲的和做的对不起头来。计划上早稻一季要收八百斤，措施上是推广良种；但是田里插的牌子上，却有不少早稻仍是“503”品种。“503”在黄岩是一种落后的早稻种，最好的也只能亩产五百来斤。因此，早稻一季收七百斤、八百斤、八百五十斤的计划，在种子上就没有准备好。社主任讲除虫工作已经做了；经过检查，红花草田里的稻根仍旧没有除，稻根中有些每丛就有二、三个螟虫。路桥一社去年的产量是一千零八十一斤，今年计划是一千五百五十斤，但是高产队里有低产田，去年早稻施肥有毛病，倒伏很多，他们对倒伏的原因却不知道。今年增产应从那些方面来努力也不明确。
    这两个第一类型社尚且存在这些问题，在全县其他地区是否也存在着这些情况呢？在全县区乡干部中开展对比检查以后，原来许多没有想到的问题都摆出来了。桐屿区、院桥区为实现亩产一千斤，计划每亩要挑一百五十担至二百担的塘泥，但在春节前，每亩平均只有六十担至七十担，不及计划的二分之一。院桥区委书记发现了这些问题以后，急得晚上通夜不眠，批判了过去的自满情绪和领导工作的一般化作风。新桥、桐屿等区检查，发现有不少乡、社干部抱着在指标上是这样订，在行动上却是做多少算多少的消极态度。
    县委在最近召开的全县区乡干部大会上，对那种自满麻痹思想和只讲不做的思想行为，进行了严肃的批判。在县区乡干部中，开展“火烧一般化领导作风”、“火烧只说不做的作风”，相互开展了批评与自我批评。（附图片）
