　　High Mountains Display Unusual Splendor, Deep Gullies Bloom with Rare Flowers
    Large Areas of Thousand-Jin Yield Fields Appear in Northern Shaanxi

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Yan'an and Yulin Special Districts of Shaanxi Province have created tens of thousands of mu of high-yield fields while building the mountainous regions of the motherland, not only achieving the target of 400 jin of grain per mu, but also creating new records in mountainous grain production of 1,000 jin and 2,000 jin per mu.

    In the historically low-yield grain area of northern Shaanxi, over 10,000 mu achieved yields of over 400 jin per mu in 1957, with 283 mu in the Yan'an Special District exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, and the highest yield reaching 2,210 jin per mu.

    These heroic banners of high yield are not erected on the mild climate and fertile plains, but in the harsh, frost-free, short-season, and barren deep mountains, the gullied valleys, and the sandy areas along the Great Wall known as "barren lands." Local farmers, through hard work, transformed steep slopes with severe soil erosion into terraced fields, blasted rocky cliffs to build irrigation canals, and turned dry land into paddy fields. In the sandy areas along the Great Wall, where sandstorms obscured the sky, Party and government leaders mobilized the masses to plant windbreaks, plant saplings, and stabilize sand dunes. In this way, pieces of desert were transformed into fertile fields, and dry gullies became granaries, resulting in many large areas of thousand-jin yield fields.

    Guidebao Gully in Guidebao Township, Yulin County, is one such thousand-jin gully, appearing in a hilly and sandy area. The gully is more than ten li long, with 423 mu of irrigated land. The gully contains the Huayuangou and Weijialou Agricultural Cooperatives. In 1956, these two cooperatives simultaneously transitioned to advanced cooperatives. Under the Party's call to increase grain production, Huayuangou Cooperative proposed a target of 1,000 jin per mu for irrigated land and initiated a competition with Weijiagou Agricultural Cooperative. To help them achieve their goal of high yield, the local Party committee sent technical cadres to the agricultural cooperatives to help brainstorm ideas, find solutions, and resolve specific problems arising in production. Since then, the production of these two agricultural cooperatives has developed rapidly. After a year of hard work, the members of Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative achieved fruitful results, exceeding their original plan with an average yield of 1,018 jin of grain per mu. Although Weijialou Agricultural Cooperative did not reach 1,000 jin, they also achieved a high-yield of 880 jin per mu. In 1957, although the gully encountered summer drought and autumn frost, the average yield of Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative still reached 1,053 jin, with 4.5 mu of high-yield fields averaging 1,900 jin per mu. Weijialou Agricultural Cooperative learned from the high-yield experience of Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative and also achieved a high-yield record of 1,012 jin of grain per mu that year. Since then, Guidebao Gully has become a thousand-jin gully.

    In the pursuit of large-area high yields, Guidebao Gully expanded the multiple cropping area and increased the planting of high-yield crops. Persisting in regular fertilizer collection and accumulation campaigns was also an important reason for achieving increased production.

    Houqinghe Agricultural Cooperative in Yijun County is located in a small valley in the Qiaoshan Mountains of northern Shaanxi. It is surrounded by high mountains, the land is extremely barren, the sunshine hours are very short, and the climate is cold. It used to be a low-yield area in Shaanxi Province. Most of the cooperative members were refugees who had fled from other places in the past. After the implementation of collectivization in 1956, under the specific guidance of the local Party committee, the cooperative closely combined the production experience of old farmers with advanced farming techniques, which rapidly increased grain production, especially rice production. In 1956, the 68 mu of rice planted by the cooperative averaged 537 jin per mu, with 3.3 mu of high-yield fields averaging 1,016 jin per mu, earning the title of Yijun County's high-yield rice cooperative. Last year, the cooperative continued to reclaim some wasteland, expanding the rice planting area to 100 mu. Despite being affected by frost, drought, and hail storms, the average yield still reached 720 jin per mu, with 40 mu of rice averaging 1,150 jin per mu, and 2 mu of youth experimental fields yielding 1,654 jin per mu, creating the highest mountainous rice yield record in the country.

    The farmers of Houqinghe Cooperative have come up with many ways to increase grain production. For example, everyone agreed that the main reasons for the low rice yield in the past were low soil temperature, sparse plant spacing, and insufficient fertilization. In order to increase soil temperature, the cooperative members began to cultivate the land, fertilize, and harrow in mid-March when the paddy fields were still frozen. When the seedlings grew to three or four inches, they drained the water to dry the fields every noon to promote seedling development. They also implemented rational shallow irrigation to increase soil temperature, promote fertilizer decomposition, and shorten the rice ripening time.

    Baimatan Central Cooperative in Huanglong County also created the "twin-stalk close planting and seedling retention method" when planting corn (leaving 2,000 tuos per mu, with each tuo retaining two corn seedlings of the same size close together. This achieves the purpose of close planting, while also benefiting from ventilation and light transmission, and can reduce nutrient consumption and maintain soil fertility). In 1957, it achieved a mountainous corn yield record of 1,958 jin per mu. Lianqi Agricultural Cooperative in Yanchang County created an even more amazing record of 2,210 jin of corn per mu in 1957.

    The heroes building the mountainous areas, in the tide of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, have once again sounded the horn to march in a more distant direction. They confidently proposed: to erect higher and larger high-yield red flags in the high mountains and deep gullies, so that high mountains display unusual splendor, and deep gullies bloom with rare flowers. For example, when formulating the 1958 production plan, Houqinghe Agricultural Cooperative deeply tapped into production potential. They proposed a leap forward target of 1,000 jin per mu for 100 mu of rice, and 2,000 jin per mu for 10 mu. In order to achieve this advanced target, all the members of the cooperative have launched a large-scale winter production upsurge. First, they launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign of thousands of carts and tens of thousands of dan, ensuring that 12,000 jin of fertilizer is applied per mu this year. At the same time, they continued to carry out basic water conservancy and land construction work.

    Recently, relevant units in various counties have systematically summarized these high-yield experiences in mountainous areas and are vigorously promoting them by running training courses, etc., so that these valuable experiences can blossom and bear fruit in all low-yield areas.

### 高山放异采　深沟开奇花  陕北出现大面积千斤丰产田

　　高山放异采　深沟开奇花
    陕北出现大面积千斤丰产田
    本报讯　陕西省延安、榆林两专区在建设祖国的山区中，创造了成千上万亩的高额丰产田，不仅达到亩产粮食四百斤的指标，而且创造了亩产千斤、两千斤的山区粮食生产新纪录。
    历史上粮食低产区的陕北地区，1957年有一万多亩亩产达到四百斤以上，其中延安专区有二百八十三亩亩产千斤以上，最高亩产达到二千二百一十斤。
    这些英雄的丰产旗帜不是树立在气候温和、土质肥沃的平川上，而是树立在气候严寒、无霜期短、土质贫瘠的深山里，丘陵沟壑交错的峡谷里以及被称为“不毛之地”的长城沿线风沙地带。当地农民凭着辛勤的劳动把坡度很大、水土流失严重的山坡修成梯田，炸开石崖，修成水渠，变旱地为水田。在风沙蔽天的长城沿线流沙地区，党政领导上发动群众栽风障，植树苗，固沙丘。就这样使一片片的沙漠变为沃野，使干沟变成了米粮川，出现了不少大面积的千斤丰产田。
    榆林县归德堡乡归德堡沟就是在多风沙的丘陵甘壑地带出现的一个千斤沟。这个沟全长共十多里，有四百二十三亩水浇地。沟内有花园沟和韦家楼两个农业社。1956年这两个社同时转入高级社，花园沟社在党关于增产粮食的号召下，提出水地亩产千斤的增产指标，并且和韦家沟农业社开展了竞赛。当地党委为了帮助他们实现丰产的愿望，派了技术干部到农业社帮助出主意，想办法，解决生产中发生的一些具体问题。从此，这两个农业社的生产就得到了飞跃的发展。花园沟农业社的社员们经过一年的辛勤劳动，获得了丰硕的果实，以平均亩产一千零十八斤粮食的成绩超额完成了原订计划；韦家楼农业社虽然没有达到千斤，也取得了平均亩产八百八十斤的丰产成绩。1957年这个沟虽然遇到了夏旱、秋冻等灾害，但花园沟农业社的平均亩产仍然达到一千零五十三斤，其中有四亩半高额丰产田平均亩产达一千九百斤。韦家楼农业社学习了花园沟农业社的增产经验，这年也获得了平均亩产一千零一十二斤粮食的丰产纪录。从此，归德堡沟就变成了一个千斤沟。
    归德堡沟在争取大面积丰产中扩大了复种面积，增种了高产作物。坚持经常的搜肥积肥运动，也是获得增产的重要原因。
    宜君县后清河农业社位于陕北乔山山脉的一条小山谷里，这里两边全是高山，土地异常贫瘠，日照时间很短，气候寒冷，原是陕西省的一个低产地区。这个社的社员大部分是过去由外地逃荒来的。1956年实行合作化以后，该社在当地党委的具体指导下，把老农的生产经验和先进的耕作技术密切结合起来，使粮食的产量尤其是水稻的产量飞速提高。1956年该社种植的六十八亩水稻平均亩产达五百三十七斤，其中有三亩三分高额丰产田平均亩产达一千零一十六斤，获得了宜君县水稻丰产社的称号。去年该社继续开垦了一部分荒地，水稻种植面积扩大到一百亩。尽管受到霜冻、旱灾和风雹暴雨的侵袭，但是平均亩产仍达到七百二十斤，其中有四十亩水稻平均亩产达一千一百五十斤，有二亩青年试验田亩产达一千六百五十四斤，创造了全国山区水稻亩产最高纪录。
    后清河社的农民想出了很多提高粮食产量的办法。如大家一致认为过去水稻产量低的主要原因是地温低，株距稀，施肥少等，为了提高地温，该社社员在3月中旬水田还结冰时就开始整地、施肥、耙耱；当秧苗长到三、四寸时，每天中午就退水晒田，以促进秧苗发育。他们又实行了合理浅灌来提高地温，促进肥料分解，缩短水稻成熟的时间。
    黄龙县白马滩中心社在种植玉米时还创造了“双胞棵密植留苗法”（每亩田留二千兜，每兜留大小一致，靠在一起的玉米苗两株。这样，既达到了密植的目的，又兼得通风透光之利，还可以减少养分消耗，保持地力），1957年获得亩产一千九百五十八斤的山区玉米丰产纪录。而延长县联旗农业社1957年更创造了亩产二千二百一十斤玉米的惊人纪录。
    建设山区的英雄们，在全国工农业生产大跃进的浪潮中，又吹起了向更远大的方向进军的号角，他们满怀信心地提出：要在高山深沟中树起更高更大的丰产红旗，使高山放异彩，深沟开奇花。如后清河农业社在制订1958年生产规划时，深入挖掘生产潜力，他们提出了水稻百亩亩产千斤，十亩亩产两千斤的跃进指标。为了争取这个先进指标的实现，该社全体社员已经掀起了一个规模巨大的冬季生产高潮，他们首先开展了千车万担的积肥运动，保证今年每亩地施肥一万二千斤。同时，继续开展了水利和土地的基本建设工作。
    最近，各县有关单位已经系统地总结了这些山区高额丰产经验，正在利用开办训练班等方式大力推广，以便使这些宝贵的经验在所有低产地区开花结果。
