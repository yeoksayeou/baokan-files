Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 8th: The Liaoning Province recently held a representative meeting of activists in socialist agricultural construction. All the representatives attending the meeting enthusiastically responded to the call of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive to achieve the grain production targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) four years ahead of schedule for the entire province. They also wrote a letter to farmers and agricultural workers throughout the province, advocating for a large-scale socialist production competition.

At this meeting, the representatives listened to the report by Chu Fengqi, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, and extensively exchanged advanced experiences from various parts of the province in achieving and exceeding the agricultural development program targets ahead of schedule, creating high-yield records for various crops, and organizing rapid leaps forward in production. In particular, the advanced experiences introduced by the representatives of Macheng County in Hubei Province, Xinxiang Special Zone in Henan Province, and Dashan Commune in Junan County in Shandong Province provided great inspiration and encouragement to the representatives. Representatives from Beizhen, Xinmin, Fengcheng, and Haicheng counties originally thought that their county's plan to achieve the agricultural development program targets two or three years ahead of schedule was already very advanced. However, after comparing themselves with the five neighboring counties of Xinbin, Andong, Gaiping, Yingkou, and Qingyuan, which had similar conditions, they realized they were being conservative. They hurriedly revised their production targets overnight and wrote letters and made phone calls to their respective counties, townships, and communes, requesting revisions to their production plans. Currently, twelve counties in the province have decided to achieve and exceed the grain production targets stipulated in the agricultural program this year, and two counties have decided to break through the per-mu yield of ginned cotton target stipulated in the program this year.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that, under the conditions of cooperativization, an annual increase of 8% is entirely possible.

　　辽宁争取提前四年实现四百斤
    据新华社沈阳8日电　辽宁省最近召开社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议。参加会议的全体代表热烈响应中共辽宁省委提出的号召，争取全省提前四年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的产粮指标，并给全省农民和农业工人写了一封信，倡议展开社会主义生产大竞赛。
    在这次会议上，代表们听了辽宁省副省长褚凤岐的报告，广泛交流了省内各地提前超额实现农业发展纲要指标、创造各种作物高产纪录和组织生产快速跃进等各方面的先进经验。尤其是湖北省麻城县、河南省新乡专区、山东省莒南县大山社代表介绍的先进经验，给代表们很大的启发和鼓舞。北镇、新民、凤城、海城等县的代表们，原先以为本县提前两三年实现农业发展纲要指标的计划已经很先进了，但是同条件差不多的新宾、安东、盖平、营口、清原五个毗邻县一比较，发现自己保守了，赶忙连夜修订生产指标，并给本县、本乡、本社写信打电话，要求修订生产规划。目前全省已有十二个县决定在今年实现和超过农业纲要规定的粮食产量指标，两个县决定在今年突破纲要规定的亩产皮棉指标。
    省委认为在合作化的条件下，每年递增8％是完全可能的。
