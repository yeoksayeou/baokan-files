Xinhua News Agency, February 13th
Can non-staple food stores that sell fish, meat, vegetables, eggs, oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar make a great leap forward? The employees of the Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store in Beijing have made a positive conclusion in this regard, and have already taken the first step on the road to a great leap forward.

In the initiative proposed to all commercial employees in the city on the 5th, the store's employees proposed: reducing the number of personnel from fifty-two to thirty-six; breaking through the eight-hour work system, with one shift working until the end of the day; improving service quality to facilitate customers; implementing holiday rotations and abolishing overtime pay; planning to increase sales by 6% this year compared to last year, reduce expenses by 1.33%, reduce commodity losses by 0.1%, increase capital turnover by sixteen times, and increase profits turned over to the state by 1.17%.

This is a medium-sized comprehensive store that sells more than 1,200 kinds of goods. In the past, the whole store had fifty-two employees, and many people only worked five or six hours a day. Some salespersons had a stiff and indifferent service attitude and often made mistakes, but they still complained about low wages and few benefits.

The Dongdan District Non-staple Food Management Office strengthened its leadership over this store during the Rectification Campaign, mobilized employees to speak out freely and expose shortcomings in management, and also widely solicited customer opinions. At the end of last year, residents in the store's service area raised more than 300 suggestions regarding service attitude, commodity storage, and procedural systems. Some housewives said, "When we buy garlic and radishes, the salesperson gives us whatever they grab. Why aren't we allowed to choose?" Some customers criticized the store for not processing meat and cold dishes in advance, but only starting to do so when the store opened, causing customers to wait in long lines. On the one hand, the Dongdan District Non-staple Food Management Office asked the store's employees to plan improvement methods separately, and on the other hand, organized them to visit the Fangshan Coal Mine, the Beijing Heating Material Factory, and the Yongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative to see the revolutionary drive of workers and peasants. This method of visiting advanced units played a great educational role for them. After returning to the store, they widely conveyed and discussed what they had seen. Salesperson Li Fachang said, "The miners' labor is really not simple. They work hard all day in the dark underground. We only work three or four hours a day. The difference is too great." Communist Youth League member Wu Changzeng said, "How energetic the peasant brothers are! In the freezing weather, men and women, old and young, work day and night to build water conservancy projects, and even put forward the slogan of surpassing the Yellow River and crossing the Yangtze River in terms of output. Look at our store, selling goods, sheltered from the wind and rain, with too many people doing nothing, and still complaining about wages and benefits." This inspired the enthusiasm of all the salespersons, and everyone was dissatisfied with their existing work performance, and they asked the leaders to lead everyone to improve their work and make a great leap forward in the store's work.

The Dongdan District Non-staple Food Management Office and the store's leaders actively supported and encouraged this revolutionary enthusiasm of the salespersons, and immediately organized the salespersons to discuss how to learn from the drive of workers and peasants. In the discussion, four major contradictions hindering the store's leap forward were exposed: First, the eight-hour work system was not in line with the actual situation of commercial work, which limited the salespersons' enthusiasm and should be adjusted immediately; Second, there were too many people, which could not improve labor efficiency. Sometimes only one customer came, but a row of salespersons stood behind the counter. The number of personnel should be reduced to support agricultural construction; Third, it was unreasonable to receive overtime pay that was twice the salary for doing more work and demanded its abolition; Fourth, the layout of the goods yard was not convenient for customers. A sixteen-meter-long counter in the vegetable section blocked the customers from buying vegetables, preventing them from choosing at will, and should be dismantled. Many sales groups also put forward many positive suggestions in connection with their own group's situation. A salesperson in a food group north of the store suggested that they were very close to the store, the food they sold overlapped with the store's, and five people only did more than one hundred yuan of business a day. This business point should be removed and merged into the food group in the store; the tobacco, liquor, and cooked meat group also requested to be merged with the food group. After these three groups were combined, six people would be enough, and ten people could be reduced.

While checking and improving their work, the store's salespersons also summarized some of the store's experiences in serving customers: processing commodities such as chicken, fish, and ribs in the store according to customer needs; in order to facilitate customers, in addition to dispatching mobile sales vehicles, "customer order boxes" were also set up in larger institutions and dormitories. Customers could write a note on what commodities they needed and put it in the box, and the salespersons would deliver the commodities to the customers' homes on a regular basis; the store established regular contact with customers and gave full play to the role of the eight "commercial supervisors" elected by the customers. Any criticisms or suggestions from customers could be promptly brought to the store for improvement. For some temporarily insufficient commodities, they were studied together with the supervisors, and proper sales methods were obtained. For example, if there were not many eggs, priority was given to patients and lying-in women, and then sold to general customers. They made every effort to eliminate the phenomenon of customers waiting in line to buy goods. For commodities with large sales volumes, such as pork and lard, they were processed in advance, some were divided into "portions," so that customers could buy them as soon as they arrived. When the number of customers buying a certain commodity increased, the salespersons supported each other, and the manager and accountant also participated in the sales, so as not to waste the customers' time. They decided to adhere to these good methods.

Now, the various indicators proposed in the store's initiative, except for some that will have to wait until the end of the year to be verified, have been fully implemented in terms of working hours, reducing personnel, abolishing overtime pay, and improving service quality. When people walk into this store, they will immediately feel a vigorous revolutionary spirit, and every employee is busy receiving customers, and no idlers can be seen. Yue Zhongguang, a salesperson in the vegetable section, once sorted vegetables all night. The next day, when he saw that there were many customers buying vegetables, he automatically helped to sell vegetables, and only went to rest when the number of customers decreased. On the afternoon of the 9th, Chen Cengshan, a salesperson in the aquatic products section, hurriedly walked out of the store, and everyone thought he had gone to rest. When he came back to work in the afternoon, they learned that he had gone to the Central Experimental Opera House to promote some chicken, fish, and frozen eggs.

### 彻底改进工作　充分便利顾客  米市大街副食品商店职工学习工农革命干劲

    彻底改进工作　充分便利顾客
    米市大街副食品商店职工学习工农革命干劲
    本报特约新华社13日讯　经营鱼、肉、菜、蛋、油、盐、酱、醋的副食品商店能不能跃进？北京市米市大街副食品商店的职工在这方面作出了肯定的结论，并且在跃进的道路上已经迈出了第一步。
    这个商店的职工在5日向全市商业职工提出的倡议中提出：人员从五十二人减到三十六人；突破八小时工作制，一天一班顶到底；提高服务质量，便利顾客；实行假日轮休，取消加班费；今年计划比去年销货额增加6％，费用减少1.33％，商品损耗降低0.1％，资金周转增加十六次，上缴利润增加1.17％。
    这是一个经营着一千二百多种商品的中等规模的综合性商店。过去全店有五十二个职工，很多人一天只做五、六个小时的工作，有些售货员服务态度生硬、冷淡、常出差错，而他们还嫌工资低、福利少。
    东单区副食品管理处在整风运动中加强了对这个店的领导，发动职工大鸣大放，揭发经营工作中的缺点，同时并普遍征求顾客意见。在去年年底，这个商店服务范围内的居民，对服务态度、商品保管和手续制度等方面提出了三百多条意见。有的家庭主妇说：“我们买蒜头、萝卜，售货员拿什么就给什么，为什么不准挑选？”有的顾客批评这个商店事先不对肉类、盘菜加工，开门时才动手，使顾客排很长的队等候。东单区副食品管理处一方面让这个商店的职工分别规划改进的办法，同时组织他们参观房山煤矿、北京市暖气材料厂和永丰农业生产合作社看工人农民的革命干劲。这种参观先进的办法，对他们起了很大的教育作用。他们回店以后普遍进行了传达和讨论。售货员李发昌说：“矿工们的劳动真不简单，整天在不见太阳的井下紧张劳动，我们一天只忙三、四个小时，比起来真相差得太远了。”共青团员吴长增说：“农民兄弟的干劲多足！在天冰地冻的日子里，男女老少都不分日夜地兴修水利，还提出了在产量上跨黄河、过长江的口号。再看看咱们店里卖货，风吹不着，雨打不着，人多闲着没有事干，还闹工资、福利。”这一来，激发了所有的售货员们的热情，大家都不满意自己现有的工作成绩，纷纷要求领导上领导大家改进工作，在商店工作上来个大跃进。
    东单区副食品管理处和商店的领导上积极支持并鼓励售货员们的这种革命热情，立即组织售货员们讨论如何学习工人、农民的干劲。在讨论中，揭发出妨碍商店跃进的四大矛盾：第一、八小时工作制的规定不符合商业工作的情况，限制了售货员积极性的发挥，应该立即调整工时；第二、人员过多，不能够提高劳动效率，有时候只来一个顾客，而柜台里却站着一排售货员，应该减少人员，支援农业建设；第三、多做点工作就要拿比工资多一倍的加班费，太不合理，要求取消；第四、货场设置不便利顾客，蔬菜组一个十六公尺长的柜台把买菜顾客挡在外边，不能随意挑选，应该拆掉。许多售货组联系本组情况还提出了很多积极的建议。在这个商店北边的一个食品组售货员提出，他们离店很近，所经营的食品又和店里重复，而且五个人一天只作一百多元的买卖，应该把这个营业点撤掉，合并到店内的食品组；烟酒熟肉组也要求和食品组合并。这三个组合起来以后，有六个人就行了，可以减去十个人。
    这个商店的售货员在检查改进工作的同时，还总结了本店在为顾客服务方面的一些经验：在店内根据顾客需要对鸡、鱼、排骨等商品进行加工；为了方便顾客，除了出动流动售货车外，还在较大的机关、宿舍设了“顾客要货箱”，顾客需要什么商品，写个纸条放在箱内，售货员定时把商品送到顾客家里；这个店和顾客建立了经常联系，充分发挥了顾客选出来的八个“商业监督员”的作用，顾客有什么批评、建议都能够及时提到商店加以改进，对某些暂时不足的商品，和监督员一起研究后，并获得了妥善的出售办法。如鸡蛋不多，就先照顾病人、产妇，然后卖给一般顾客。全力消灭顾客排队候购的现象，对销售量较多的猪肉、猪油等商品，提前加工，有的分成“份”，使顾客随到随买。在买某一种商品的顾客增多的时候，售货员们互相支援，经理、会计也参加售货，免得顾客浪费时间。他们决定要把这些好的办法坚持下去。
    现在，这个商店在倡议中所提出的各项指标，除有些要等到年终时才能核算外，在工时、减人、取消加班费和提高服务质量方面，已全部贯彻执行。人们走进这个商店，就会立刻感到一股蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气，个个职工都忙着接待顾客，看不到一个闲人。蔬菜组的售货员岳中光有一次整理了一夜蔬菜，第二天看到买菜的顾客很多，就自动帮助卖菜，一直忙到顾客减少了才去休息。水产组售货员陈层山在9日中午，急急忙忙地走出店门，大家都以为他休息去了，下午他回来上班的时候，才知道他已经到中央实验歌剧院推销了一部分鸡、鱼和冰蛋。
