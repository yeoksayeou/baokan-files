    Turning the "Four Pests'" Headquarters into a Beautiful Artificial Lake
    People of the Dongsi District of Beijing Undertake Voluntary Labor During the Spring Festival
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) To thoroughly eliminate the four pests, the people of Dongsi District in Beijing began constructing a worker's lake outside Andingmen yesterday. This area was originally a kiln pit depression filled with stinky water, the headquarters of the four pests in Dongsi District, and local residents called it the "man-eating pit."
    After the lake is completed, it can store 850,000 cubic meters of water, irrigating more than 4,200 mu of land. The surrounding area will be planted with trees, and the lake will be stocked with fish, turning it into a beautiful scenic area.
    The lake construction project is being carried out entirely through voluntary labor. It began on February 20th and is scheduled to be completed by March 20th. The construction site only prepared more than 900 earth baskets and tubs, and 2,000 shovels and picks. The notice was to start work on the third day of the lunar new year, but in fact, from New Year's Eve, one or two thousand people have been coming to work every day voluntarily. There were not enough tools, so residents brought their own. Some Young Pioneers even brought basins from home to carry soil.
    Participants in digging the lake include district people's representatives, workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, teachers, students, commercial workers, housewives, and office cadres, lamas from Yonghe Temple, nuns and monks from temples, and Young Pioneers. Liu Laowu, a 68-year-old man who lives by this pit, had worked as a hired hand for landlords since he was a child, and slept by this stinky pond at night, his body covered in mosquito bites. The old man was extremely happy when he heard that the government was going to dig a lake, and he volunteered to dedicate eighty ridges of vegetable garden land.

    把“四害”的大本营变成美丽的人工湖
    北京东四区人民春节展开义务劳动
    本报讯　北京市东四区人民，为了彻底消除四害，昨天在安定门外开始修建一座工人湖。这原来是一块窑坑洼地，臭水满塘，是东四区四害的大本营，当地居民都叫它“吃人坑”。
    这个湖修成以后，可以蓄水八十五万立方公尺，能灌溉四千二百多亩土地，四周将种满树木，湖里准备养鱼，变成一个美丽的风景区。
    建湖工程完全用义务劳动进行。从2月20日开始，准备到3月20日完成。工地只准备了九百多个土筐和土篮，两千把锹、镐。通知是在旧历初三开工，实际上从除夕那天起每天都有一两千人自动来干活。工具不够用，居民们自己带来了工具。有些红领巾甚至从家里拿来了脸盆端土。
    参加挖湖的人，有区人民代表，工人，解放军官兵，教师，学生，商业工作者，家庭妇女和机关干部，雍和宫的喇嘛，寺院的尼姑、和尚，和少先队员。在这个坑边住着个六十八岁的老头刘老五，他自小给地主扛活，晚上就睡在这臭塘边上，蚊子咬得他身上满是斑点。老人家听说政府要挖湖，高兴极了，自报奋勇献出了八十畦菜园地。
