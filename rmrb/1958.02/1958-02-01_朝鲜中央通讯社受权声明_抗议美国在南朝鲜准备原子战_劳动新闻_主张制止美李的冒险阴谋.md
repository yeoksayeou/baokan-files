　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st - The Korean Central News Agency, authorized, issued a statement on the 30th, protesting the United States' actions of transporting atomic cannons into South Korea and the US military holding large-scale atomic war exercises in South Korea.
    The Korean Central News Agency statement said that the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique continue to rudely violate the armistice agreement, transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, and continue to strengthen military forces, plotting to provoke a new war. This is another serious provocative act aggravating the tense situation in Korea and threatening peace.
    The statement said that we resolutely condemn and protest this criminal act of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st - The Pyongyang "Labor News" published an editorial today stating that the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique recently conducted the largest atomic "strike" military exercise since the armistice in the area near the military demarcation line, and immediately after transported atomic cannons into South Korea. This is the most blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the most serious provocative act against peace. The Korean people resolutely protest and condemn this act.
    The editorial said that for four years since the Korean armistice, the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique have continuously violated the armistice agreement, and this time they are trampling on the armistice agreement even more rudely. These facts prove that they are continuing to aggravate the tense situation in Korea and the Far East, plotting to provoke a new war, and attempting to turn South Korea into the foremost base for atomic weapons and missiles. This is a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world.
    The editorial said that the Korean people resolutely advocate: maintaining the Korean armistice and transforming the armistice into a consolidated peace; immediately stopping the adventurous war conspiracy of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique; and unhesitatingly abolishing the US imperialist colonial rule over South Korea. The Korean people also resolutely advocate that the issue of Korean unification must be resolved by the Korean people themselves in a peaceful manner. To this end, the US aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea, and the democratic rights of the South Korean people and the freedom of activity of all political parties and social organizations must be guaranteed.

    朝鲜中央通讯社的声明说，美帝国主义和李承晚集团继续粗暴地违反停战协定，把原子武器运进南朝鲜，并且继续增强军事力量，策划挑起新的战争。这是加剧朝鲜的紧张局势以及威胁和平的又一次严重的挑衅行为。

    据新华社平壤31日电　平壤“劳动新闻”今天发表的社论说，美帝国主义和李承晚集团最近在军事分界线以南的附近地区举行了停战以来规模最大的原子“出击”军事演习以后，紧接着就把原子炮运入南朝鲜。这是最粗暴地违反朝鲜停战协定的行动，也是对和平的最严重的挑衅行为，朝鲜人民坚决抗议和谴责这种行为。

    社论说，朝鲜人民坚决主张：维护朝鲜的停战，并且把停战转变为巩固的和平；立即制止美国和李承晚集团的冒险的战争阴谋；毫不迟疑地废除美帝国主义对南朝鲜的殖民统治。朝鲜人民还坚决主张朝鲜的统一问题必须由朝鲜人民自己以和平的方式来加以解决。为此，美国侵略军必须立即撤出南朝鲜，必须保障南朝鲜人民的民主权利以及一切政党和社会团体的自由活动。
