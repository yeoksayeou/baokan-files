Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: At the fifth session of the First National People's Congress today, representatives continued to hold a general meeting for discussion. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, stated in his speech that all cultural workers should resolutely implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, boost their energy to closely coordinate with the new leap forward on the industrial and agricultural fronts, and promote a cultural upsurge.

Qian Junrui pointed out that going deep into the masses, especially into the countryside, better integrating with the worker-peasant masses, and carrying out widespread, in-depth, and arduous cultural propaganda among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is the central link in the current work of all cultural institutions and cultural workers. In 1958, we must achieve a great leap forward in this area. Now, a large number of writers and artists have already gone or are going to the countryside and factories, and a nationwide cultural movement facing workers and peasants, deeply involving workers and peasants, and wholeheartedly serving workers and peasants is gradually taking shape.

Qian Junrui emphasized that all cultural departments and artistic groups across the country must carry the anti-waste movement through to the end. He demanded that national cultural expenditures in 1958 be reduced by 5% to 10% compared to what was listed in the national budget. Qian Junrui said that extravagant waste and that kind of extravagance, bureaucracy, and stagnation must be completely burned away with a raging fire, and a new atmosphere of diligence, thrift, hardship, and simplicity must be established. Only in this way can cultural and artistic undertakings truly become the cause of the worker-peasant masses and better serve them. Qian Junrui also pointed out that not performing bad plays and not circulating bad books and bad songs is the duty of every artist. He said that the prevalence of bad plays, bad books, bad songs, and bad dances essentially marks the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on socialism in the ideological field. We must maintain high vigilance and must conduct serious criticism, resistance, and opposition to the poisonous weeds that poison and corrode the working people.

In their speeches, the representatives pointed out that in order for culture and science to better serve the great leap forward in production and construction and the worker-peasant masses, a top priority is to continue strengthening the ideological transformation of intellectuals. When Deng Chumin, Vice Governor of Shanxi Province, spoke about this issue, he said that after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, even if some intellectuals no longer openly compare the Party to a mother-in-law and themselves to a daughter-in-law, some people still do not have a sense of ownership, and regard the relationship between the people and the Party and themselves as a guest-host relationship, and cannot link their personal fate with the fate of the working people, the hopeful fate of the nation, and the great communist cause. This is very dangerous for the progress of every intellectual.

Deng Chumin said that this spring is another extraordinary spring. In this great time, as long as intellectuals are determined to transform themselves, there is no force that can stop the pace of progress. What is most feared is that they do not clearly understand their class attributes and overestimate themselves.

Democratic party members should open their hearts and be pure, frank, and honest people.

In his speech on the transformation of bourgeois elements, bourgeois intellectuals, and members of democratic parties, Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Governor of Hunan Province, pointed out that the situation of the great leap forward is exciting, but at the same time, it cannot but create a sense of "the situation is pressing," spurring people to quickly stop "fooling around" and end the dangerous state of being "gentlemen on the beams." Otherwise, walking on cotton, one day they will still stumble.

He said that the democratic parties should thoroughly liquidate the adverse effects of the Rightists through the rectification movement on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, so that every member firmly accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and firmly takes the socialist road. At the same time, they must also make a painful determination to get rid of officialdom and open their hearts. A considerable portion of the members of the democratic parties who came from the old society, if they do not eliminate officialdom, the beautiful words of "serving workers and peasants" will become worthless nonsense. Members of all democratic parties, including myself, should openly open their hearts through rectification and be pure, frank, and honest people. Otherwise, making falsehoods will be exhausting and clumsy, singing old tunes during the day and clownish faces at night, putting themselves in a state of mental division. Long nights and recurring dreams will certainly not allow them to sleep peacefully, and they will inevitably waver politically, leading to adverse and dangerous consequences.

Agricultural research work should be combined with the wisdom and labor creations of hundreds of millions of peasants.

At today's meeting, Ding Ying, President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Xiang Nan, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and other representatives spoke about promoting a great leap forward in agricultural scientific research; vigorously promoting work-study programs; and more broadly carrying out mass sports movements to improve the health of the people across the country, in order to better serve the great leap forward in production and construction in these areas. Ding Ying, who recently returned from the Soviet Union, said that agricultural scientists should seriously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, boost their revolutionary spirit, summarize the rich experience of agricultural production in China for thousands of years, and combine it with the wisdom and labor creations of hundreds of millions of peasants, in order to realize a great leap forward in agricultural scientific research and better serve the great development of agriculture in the country. In his speech, Xiang Nan said that work-study programs can reduce state expenditures, expand the student body, increase the proportion of worker-peasant students, improve the quality of learning, and better cultivate talents who meet socialist requirements and are both red and expert. This policy should be actively and systematically implemented in schools across the country to make a great leap forward in China's education from quantity to quality.

Rong Gaotang emphasized that sports work must continue to adhere to the policy of carrying out mass sports movements. He believes that as long as we continue to implement the above policy and continuously improve the technical level of athletes, China's sports cause will surely be able to achieve a great leap forward in ten years and strive to catch up with the world level in major sports in about ten years.

Rong Gaotang said that during the first five-year plan period, Chinese athletes broke the national record 1,725 times, and in 1957, three world records appeared in weightlifting, swimming, and women's high jump. In particular, female high jumper Zheng Fengrong created the first world record in track and field, shocking the world. This is another powerful proof of the great superiority of China's socialist system, and it also proves that it is entirely possible to strive for more sports achievements to reach the international level.

Zhao Jianmin, Governor of Shandong Province, reported to the conference on the heroic deeds of the people of Shandong in overcoming extraordinarily large floods and droughts, fully demonstrating the great strength of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party to overcome any difficulties. He said that Shandong suffered from unprecedented floods and droughts last year, the worst in a century and decades, respectively. With the strong support of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and all parts of the country, the party, government, military, and people of the province worked hard and finally overcame the extraordinarily large floods and droughts, safely rescuing more than 1.5 million disaster victims trapped in deep water, repairing more than 1.34 million collapsed houses, rushing to plug more than 12,000 breaches in large and small rivers, and rushing to plant more than 5.2 million mu of late autumn crops; in the drought resistance, the province basically completed the winter wheat planting plan. Through disaster relief work, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened. Many disaster victims concluded from their own experience: "I have never seen such a great famine, I have never seen such a good government, and the kindness of the Communist Party can never be forgotten." Now, the people of the province are launching an unprecedented upsurge in agricultural production.

Gao Shuxun, Vice Governor of Hebei Province, reported to the conference on the magnificent plan for the great development of agriculture in Hebei Province. He said that since the beginning of winter, the people of the province have launched an unprecedentedly magnificent mass movement to build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer, requiring the basic realization of water conservancy in the province in the next two years; this year, 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu is required; this year, pig farming will reach 20 million heads, and in 1962, the province will average one pig per person (50 million heads); soil improvement will be completed in three years, and 50 million mu will be improved this year; this year, the number of counties and cities with a grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu will reach 80 (only nine counties and two cities last year), and the number of counties and cities with a cotton yield of more than 60 jin per mu will reach 70 (only eight counties and one city last year); a three-year blitz and a five-year completion of greening. He said that after achieving the above requirements this year, the province's agricultural cooperatives can basically catch up with or exceed the production and income levels of local rich middle peasants. Now the people of the province are bravely advancing towards the goal of "fighting hard for three years to change the face of the land, and completing the ten-year plan in five years."

Ji Jinmei, Director of the General Office of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Lei Chunguo, Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, respectively introduced the work situation in Tibet and the Jingpo area of Yunnan to the conference. Ji Jinmei said that in recent years, the Tibet region has achieved remarkable results in politics, economy, culture, and health. There, small-scale industries such as power plants, automobile repair plants, and iron factories have been built; primary and secondary schools have been established in various places, and students are admitted free of charge; medical institutions have been established in important towns to treat Tibetan people free of charge.

Ji Jinmei emphasized that since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the offices of various basic units, the work in Tibet has entered a new stage, laying a reliable foundation for the Tibetan people to move towards a socialist society. He stated that in the future, it is necessary to further strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet; continue to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist patriotic united front; thoroughly implement the peaceful agreement; and resolutely safeguard the unity and development of the motherland's national family, in order to better build the new Tibet of the motherland.

Representative Lei Chunguo said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Jingpo people have begun a direct transition to a socialist society. By the end of 1957, the number of agricultural cooperatives run by the Jingpo and Lisu peoples had increased from 86 in 1956 to 216, and another half of the peasant households had joined mutual aid teams, and the people's lives had generally improved. Lei Chunguo stated that on their road forward, they hope that the Han and other advanced fraternal nationalities will continue to provide them with assistance.

At today's meeting, Li Hui, Deputy Commissioner of the Jinnan Prefecture of Shanxi Province, Wang Guangying and Zhu Jisheng, Vice Chairmen of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhou Shutao, Vice Mayor of Tianjin, Cui Dexi, Shandong Provincial Industrial Labor Model, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, Zhu Xianfang, Deputy Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry, Liu Peizhi, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Li Chenggui, Kang Juying, and Kuang Jingrong, Hunan Provincial Agricultural Labor Models, and Zhang Yi, Wu Yixiu, Qiu Ji, Yi Meihou, and Fang Junshi, overseas Chinese representatives, also made speeches or written statements. A total of twenty-six representatives spoke at today's meeting.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Li Weihan, Wang Weizhou, Wu Yuzhang, Yang Mingxuan, Zhang Nanxian, Zhou Shutao, Tang Shengzhi, Ba Jin, Deng Fangzhi, and Xiraojiacuo.

Today's meeting ended at 7:05 p.m. Tomorrow is Sunday, and the meeting will be adjourned for one day.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: At the fifth session of the National People's Congress held this morning, twenty-four representatives from workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the military expressed their determination to bring their wisdom and talents into play and contribute their strength in every possible way in the great upsurge of socialist construction.

Intellectuals should be promoters of writing reform

The meeting was held at 9:00 a.m. Many intellectual representatives stated that in the work of writing reform, everyone should be a promoter, contribute to the cultural construction of the motherland, and fight against all kinds of conservative habits. Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University, said that writing reform is considered from the interests of 600 million people, it is for the working people and future generations, and intellectuals who have mastered culture should play an active role in this work, not stand by, passively treat, and should not only look at this issue from personal habits and temporary convenience.

Chen Yuan said that we are a "poor and blank" country, not only in the economy and other aspects must we work hard, but also make the national working people quickly master culture. He believes that now there is a shortcut to master culture, so we should not take the old road. In particular, every teacher education worker should be a promoter, take active action, and contribute to the unprecedented feat of changing China's cultural backwardness.

Wu Yifang, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, said in a written statement that the complex dialects in Jiangsu bring many inconveniences to work, and therefore, she particularly felt the great significance of promoting Mandarin. Wu Yifang said that with the Chinese phonetic alphabet, it provides a tool for learning culture and promoting Mandarin in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and it will become a powerful weapon to help the working people carry out cultural revolution.

Dappu Sheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association, emphasized in a written statement that writing reform is also a great good thing for the people of ethnic minorities. In addition to using their own ethnic languages and writing, all ethnic groups urgently need a common national language and a common script, which is of great benefit to consolidating the unity of all ethnic groups and helping ethnic minorities learn from the Han elder brother.

Wang Chonglun, Hu Zhaosen, Meng Tai, Shao Xianghua, and Zhang Mingshan, five representatives from Anshan Iron and Steel, made a joint statement today. They said that now the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel feel that their responsibility is glorious and heavy, and they are determined to respond to the call of the central government to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in steel production in fifteen years or a little longer. They said that the workers of Anshan have initially determined that this year's pig iron production will increase by 16.1% compared with last year, steel production will increase by 25.4% compared with last year, and steel production will increase by 16.9%. They said that in order to achieve a great leap forward in production, we must continue to learn advanced experience from the Soviet Union and brother factories and mines, and improve technology in order to better play the potential of equipment.

The Gobi turns into an oasis and the desert becomes fertile land

Some representatives from remote areas of the motherland talked about the various great feats of the peasants in transforming nature. Xue Wanxiang, a forestry labor model from Minqin County, Gansu Province, talked about the great struggle of the people in his hometown against wind and sand. He said that Minqin County is close to the Mongolian desert, and when the wind blows, the yellow sand obscures the sky. In the agricultural cooperative he belongs to, five villages have been buried by quicksand in the past thirty years, and more than 4,000 mu of farmland out of more than 6,000 mu have been covered by quicksand and cannot be cultivated. Since 1951, the masses have launched a large-scale afforestation movement, and now the quicksand has been basically blocked, and many lands that were submerged by sand in the past have been taken back. Xue Wanxiang said that their Zhangye area is also preparing to build a large sand-proof forest belt along the edge of the desert, 3,000 li long and 3 li wide. In the near future, the Hexi Corridor will become a good place where the wind will not become a disaster, the sand will not move south, the Gobi will turn into an oasis, and the desert will become fertile land.

Bayanhu, the county head of Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province (Mongolian), said that the production upsurge in Zhaoyuan County was carried out under the conditions of suffering from a particularly large flood disaster in 1957, a rare heavy snowfall of more than three feet deep last winter, and a severe cold of more than 30 degrees below zero. The peasants said: "The winter in the Great Northern Wilderness has turned into spring", and the people of the county have the confidence to achieve an average yield of 400 jin per mu in the county this year. They said: "Mountains and rivers can be changed, and leaping forward is not difficult", "Jump to the north of the Yellow River this year, jump to the south of the Yellow River in three years, and cross the Yangtze River within ten years."

Build the army diligently and thriftily to support socialist construction

Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, focused on the issue of building the army diligently and thriftily and the army's participation in national socialist construction. He said that the year-by-year reduction of defense expenditures will not affect national defense construction and army building. In order to use the state funds mainly in economic construction, the national defense expenditures in the state budget have been reduced every year since the first year of the first five-year plan. In 1953, the defense expenditure was 6.17644 billion yuan, accounting for 28.87% of the state's total budget in that year. This year's defense expenditure budget is 5 billion yuan, which has dropped to 15.12% of the state's total budget.

Gan Siqi said that our army is the people's army, and we have the ambition and determination to spend the least money and do the most things.

Some representatives from the business community expressed that they should actively transform their positions, boost their enthusiasm, and truly make more contributions to the country. Hu Juewen, a representative from Shanghai, said that we industrialists and businessmen can only resolutely invest in the rectification movement and transform our political positions in order to adapt to our current economic status and live and work happily in a socialist society. Chen Jing, a representative from Hubei, requested in a written statement that industrialists and businessmen should also have a great leap forward in self-transformation. He said that if our political position does not change, we will become an onlooker, or a promoter of retreat, or even an obstacle to progress in the great leap forward of the motherland.

Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Christianity in China, called on Christians across the country to resolutely take the socialist road with a hundredfold confidence in the current new international and domestic situation. Wu Yaozong asked Chinese Christians to completely eliminate the thoughts and feelings that conflict with socialism, whether these thoughts and feelings come from the old society or from the Western bourgeoisie. He emphasized that only by obtaining the people's point of view and the people's position can we resolutely and happily take the socialist road.

Also speaking and making written statements at this morning's conference were Qin Yingji, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, Chen Side, Vice Governor of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Guangdong Province, agricultural labor models Zhang Sizhou and Rao Xingli, Xu Chiwen, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department, Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, industrial labor model Li Fenglian, Wang Xuncai, Deputy Director of the Fifth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Liu Chengzhao, President of Sichuan Medical College, Luo Wencai, Deputy County Head of Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, and other representatives.

The executive chairmen of the morning conference were Huang Yanpei, Gao Chongmin, Ma Mingfang, Hu Yaobang, Yang Hanxian, Guojimugu, Mei Lanfang, Zhou Wenjiang, and Han Wangchen.

　　配合工农战线的大跃进
    文化工作必须赶快追上去
    人民代表强调知识分子应加快改造步伐促进文化高潮
    据新华社8日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议今天下午继续举行大会讨论。文化部副部长钱俊瑞代表在发言中要求全国文化工作者坚决贯彻为工农兵服务的方针，为密切地配合工业战线和农业战线的新跃进而鼓起干劲，促进文化高潮。
    钱俊瑞指出，深入群众，特别是深入农村，更好地和工农群众相结合，向广大工农兵群众进行普遍深入和艰苦的文化宣传工作，这是一切文化机构和文化工作者当前工作的中心环节，1958年我们必须在这方面来一个大跃进。现在，大批作家和文艺工作者已经或者正在下乡下厂，一个全国规模的面向工农、深入工农，全心全意为工农服务的文化运动已经在逐渐形成。
    钱俊瑞强调全国所有文化部门和文艺团体必须把反浪费运动进行到底，他要求1958年的全国文化经费要比国家预算所列的节减5％到10％。钱俊瑞说，要用熊熊烈火，把铺张浪费和那种阔气、官气、暮气彻底烧掉，树立起勤劳、节俭、艰苦、朴素的新风气，只有这样才能使文化艺术事业真正成为工农群众的事业并更好地为他们服务。钱俊瑞还指出，不演坏戏，不流传坏书和坏歌曲是每个文艺工作者所应尽的职责。他说，坏戏、坏书、坏歌、坏舞的流行，实质上标志着资产阶级在思想领域内向社会主义的猖狂进攻。我们必须保持高度警惕，必须对毒害和腐蚀劳动人民的毒草进行严肃的批判、抵制和反对。
    代表们在发言中指出：要使文化和科学能够更好地为生产建设大跃进和工农群众服务，一个头等重要的问题是必须继续加强知识分子的思想改造。山西省副省长邓初民代表在谈到这个问题时说，经过整风和反右派斗争，纵然某些知识分子再不公开地把党比作婆婆，把自己比作媳妇，但有些人总是没有主人翁感觉，把人民和党同他的关系看做是主客关系，不能把个人的命运同劳动人民的命运、大有希望的民族命运、伟大的共产主义事业联系在一起。这对于每一个知识分子的进步来说，都是很危险的。
    邓初民说，今年的春天又是一个不平凡的春天，在这大好的时光里，知识分子只要决心改造，前进的步伐是没有任何力量阻挡得住的，最怕的就是他对自己的阶级属性认识不清，过高的估计自己。
    民主党派成员应该把心交出来做纯洁的人，坦白的人，老实的人
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席、湖南省省长程潜代表的发言在谈到资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子和民主党派成员的改造问题时指出，大跃进的形势令人闻风起舞，同时也不能不产生“形势逼人”之感，鞭策人们应该迅速停止“鬼混”，结束“梁上君子”的危险状态，否则，脚底下踩着棉花，有朝一日，仍然会栽跟头的。
    他说，各民主党派应该在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，通过整风运动彻底清算右派的恶劣影响，使每个成员坚决地接受共产党的领导和坚定地走社会主义道路，同时还必须痛下决心打掉官气，把心交出来。在旧社会混过来的相当大一部分的民主党派成员，如果官气不除，“为工农服务”的漂亮言词将成为一文不值的废话。各民主党派成员包括我自己在内，都应通过整风赤裸裸地把心交出来，做纯洁的人，坦白的人，老实的人。否则作伪心劳日拙，白天唱老生，晚上唱花鼻子，把自己陷于精神分裂的状态，夜长梦回，一定不能安心睡觉，在政治上必将摇摆不定，招致恶劣危险的后果。
　　农业研究工作应和几亿农民的智慧和劳动创造结合起来
    在今天下午的大会上，中国农业科学院院长丁颖、共青团中央书记处书记项南、国家体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠等代表，分别谈到要促进农业科学研究工作的大跃进；大力提倡勤工俭学；更广泛地开展群众体育运动以提高全国人民的健康水平，在这些方面更好地为生产建设大跃进服务。最近刚从苏联回国的丁颖说，农业科学工作者要认真学习苏联先进经验，鼓起革命干劲，总结中国几千年来农业生产的丰富经验，与几亿农民的智慧和劳动创造相结合，来实现农业科学研究工作的大跃进，更好地为全国农业大发展服务。项南在发言中说，勤工俭学可以减少国家开支，扩大学生队伍，增加工农学生成分，提高学习质量，更好地培养出合乎社会主义要求的又红又专的人材，这个方针应该积极地有步骤地在全国学校中普遍实行，使我国教育事业从数量到质量也来个大跃进。
    荣高棠强调体育工作必须继续坚持开展群众性体育运动的方针。他认为，只要我们继续贯彻上述方针和不断提高运动员的技术水平，我国体育事业就一定能够在十年内来个大跃进，力争十年左右在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平。
    荣高棠说，在第一个五年计划期间，我国运动员打破了全国最高纪录一千七百二十五次，在1957年出现了举重、游泳、女子跳高三项世界纪录。特别是女子跳高运动员郑凤荣，第一次创造了田径方面的世界纪录，震动了全球。这是我国社会主义制度巨大优越性的又一有力证明，同时也证明争取更多的运动项目的成绩达到国际水平是完全可以作到的。
    山东省省长赵健民代表向大会报告的山东人民战胜特大洪水和旱灾的英雄事迹，充分证明在共产党领导下的中国人民具有克服任何困难的巨大力量。他说，山东去年连续遭到百年以来未有的水灾、数十年未有的大旱灾。在党中央、国务院和全国各地大力支援下，全省党、政、军、民艰苦奋斗，终于战胜了特大洪水和旱灾，使被深水围困的一百五十余万灾民安然脱险，修复倒房一百三十四万余间，抢堵大小河流决口一万二千余处，抢种晚秋作物五百二十余万亩；在抗旱中基本上完成了全省冬小麦播种计划。通过救灾工作，进一步密切了党与群众的关系，许多灾民从切身体验得出结论说：“从来没有见过这样的大灾荒，从来没有见过这样的好政府，共产党的恩情永世不能忘”。现在，全省人民正在展开空前的农业生产高潮。
    河北省副省长高树勋代表向大会报告了河北省农业大发展的宏伟规划。他说，入冬以来，全省人民开展了一个空前壮阔的群众性兴修水利和积肥运动，要求在今后两年基本上实现全省水利化；今年要求每亩地施肥一万斤；今年养猪将达到二千万头，1962年全省平均要达到一人一头猪（五千万头）；三年完成改良土壤，今年改良五千万亩；今年粮食亩产四百斤以上的县、市将达到八十个（去年只有九个县二个市），棉花亩产六十斤以上的县、市将达到七十个（去年只有八个县一个市）；三年突击，五年完成绿化。他说，在实现上述今年的要求后，全省农业社就可以基本上赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产、收入水平。现在全省人民正在向“苦战三年改变面貌，十年计划五年完成”的目标奋勇前进。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会办公厅主任计晋美代表、云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长雷春国代表，分别向大会介绍了西藏和云南景颇族地区的工作情况。计晋美说，几年来，西藏地区在政治、经济、文化、卫生各方面都已获得了显著成绩。在那里，现在已经建成了发电厂、汽车修配厂、铁工厂等小型工业；各地已经设立了中小学校，学生免费入学；重要城镇都设立了医疗机构，免费为藏族人民治病。
    计晋美强调指出，从西藏自治区筹备委员会和各基巧办事处成立后，已使西藏的工作进入了一个新的阶段，奠定了西藏人民走向社会主义社会的可靠基础。他表示，今后要进一步加强汉、藏民族和西藏内部的团结；继续巩固和扩大反帝爱国统一战线，彻底执行和平协议；坚决维护祖国民族大家庭的统一和发展，以便更好地建设祖国的新西藏。
    雷春国代表说，在中国共产党的领导下，景颇族已经开始了向社会主义社会的直接过渡。到1957年底，景颇族和傈僳族人民办的农业社，已经由1956年的八十六个发展到二百一十六个，另外还有一半农户加入了互助组，人民生活普遍得到改善。雷春国表示，在他们前进的道路上，希望汉族和其他先进的兄弟民族继续给予他们帮助。
    在今天下午大会上发言或作书面发言的，还有山西省晋南专署副专员李辉，天津市工商联副主任委员王光英、朱继圣，天津市副市长周叔弢，山东省工业劳动模范崔德锡，中国致公党主席陈其尤，江西省工业厅副厅长朱仙舫，黑龙江省工商联主任委员刘佩芝，湖南省农业劳动模范李呈桂、康菊英、林业劳动模范旷经荣，华侨代表张翼、吴益修、丘及、蚁美厚、方君时等代表。今天下午发言的代表共有二十六人。
    今天下午大会的执行主席是：李维汉、王维舟、吴玉章、杨明轩、张难先、周叔弢、唐生智、巴金、邓芳芝、喜饶嘉错。
    今天下午的大会七时零五分结束。明天是星期日，大会休会一天。
    据新华社8日讯　在今天上午举行的全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，工人、农民、知识分子和军队等方面的二十四位代表在发言中，纷纷提出要在伟大的社会主义建设高潮中，发挥智慧和才能，想尽各种办法贡献出自己的力量。
　　知识分子要当文字改革的促进派
    大会在上午九时举行。很多知识分子代表表示要在文字改革工作中，人人都当促进派，在祖国的文化建设事业上贡献力量，并且同各种守旧的习惯力量作斗争。北京师范大学校长陈垣代表说，文字改革是从六亿人民的利益考虑的，是为劳动人民和子孙后代着想的，掌握了文化的知识分子应当在这一工作中起积极的作用，不能袖手旁观，消极对待，不应仅从个人的习惯和一时的方便来看这个问题。
    陈垣说，我们是一个“又穷又白”的国家，不但在经济上以及其他方面要苦战，并且要使全国劳动人民尽快的掌握文化。他认为现在已经有了掌握文化的捷径，因此不应该仍走旧路。尤其每一个师范教育工作者，要当促进派，积极行动起来，在改变我国文化落后状态的史无前例的壮举中贡献力量。
    江苏省副省长吴贻芳代表在书面发言中，谈到江苏境内方言复杂，给工作带来很多不便，因此，特别感到推广普通话这一工作的重大意义。吴贻芳说，有了汉语拼音方案，就提供了一个学习文化、推广普通话的多、快、好、省的工具，它将成为帮助劳动人民进行文化革命的有力武器。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生代表在书面发言中强调说，文字改革工作对少数民族人民也是一件极大的好事，各族人民除了使用本民族的语言文字外，还迫切需要一种全国共同的语言和通用的文字，而这对于巩固各族人民的团结、帮助少数民族向汉族老大哥学习，是大有益处的。
    来自鞍钢的王崇伦、胡兆森、孟泰、邵象华、张明山等五位代表今天联合发言。他们说，现在鞍钢的职工都感到自己的责任光荣重大，他们决心响应中央提出的在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁产量方面赶上或超过英国的号召。他们说，现在鞍山职工已经初步确定今年生铁产量比去年增长16.1％，钢的产量比去年增长25.4％，钢材增长16.9％。他们说，为了实现生产大跃进，必须继续向苏联及兄弟厂矿学习先进经验，提高技术，以便更好地发挥设备潜力。
　　戈壁变绿洲沙漠成良田
    祖国边远地区的一些代表，谈到了农民们改造大自然的各种伟大壮举。甘肃省民勤县的林业劳动模范薛万祥，谈到他们家乡人民同风沙所进行的伟大斗争。他说，民勤县紧靠蒙古沙漠，风刮起来黄沙遮天。他所在的农业社，三十年来有五个庄子给流沙埋掉，六千多亩耕地就有四千多亩被流沙盖住不能耕种。自从1951年起，群众展开了大规模的植树造林运动，现在流沙基本上被挡住了，许多过去被沙子淹没的田地已被夺回来。薛万祥说，他们张掖专区还准备沿沙漠边缘造一条长三千华里、宽三华里的防沙大林带。不久的将来，河西走廊就将变成风不成灾，沙不南移，戈壁变绿洲，沙漠成良田的好地方。
    黑龙江省肇源县县长巴彦胡代表（蒙族）说，肇源县的生产高潮是在1957年遭受特大洪水灾害、去冬降了几十年少有的三尺多深大雪和零下三十多度严寒的条件下开展起来的。农民们说：“北大荒的冬天变成了春天”，全县人民有信心把今年全县平均每亩产量达到四百斤。他们说：“山河都可改，跃进并不难”，“今年跳到黄河北，三年跳到黄河南，十年之内过长江。”
　　勤俭建军支援社会主义建设
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇代表的发言，着重谈了勤俭建军和军队参加国家社会主义建设问题。他说，国防费的逐年减少，并不会影响到国防建设和军队建设。为了把国家资金主要用在经济建设方面，从第一个五年计划的第一年起，国家预算中的国防费每年都有所减少。1953年国防费用是六十一亿七千六百四十四万元，占国家当年总预算的28.87％，今年国防费预算五十亿元，已下降到国家总预算的15.12％。
    甘泗淇说，我们的军队是人民的军队，我们有志气和决心，花最少的钱，作最多的事。
    一些工商界的代表，表示要积极改造立场、鼓起干劲、真正对国家作出更多的贡献。上海市代表胡厥文说，我们工商业者只有痛下决心积极投入整风运动，改造政治立场，才能适应我们现在所处的经济地位，愉快地在社会主义社会里生活和工作下去。湖北省代表陈经?在书面发言中要求工商业者在自我改造方面也要来一个大跃进。他说，我们的政治立场不改变，在祖国的大跃进中就会成为一个旁观者，或者是促退派，甚至成为前进中的阻碍。
      中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗代表在书面发言中，号召全国基督教徒在当前国际国内的新形势下，以百倍的信心坚决地走社会主义道路。吴耀宗要求中国基督徒必须彻底地消除同社会主义相抵触的思想感情，不管这种思想感情是从旧社会来的，还是从西方资产阶级来的。他强调只有取得了人民的观点，人民的立场，才能坚决地、愉快地走社会主义道路。
