Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 25th. According to TASS, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party passed a resolution welcoming the results of the 35th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and supported the resolution of this plenary session on the sectarian activities of the group of Schirdewan, Wollweber, and others.
	The resolution of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party emphasized that these people attempted to change the Party's effective policies in building socialism and strengthening the worker-peasant regime in the German Democratic Republic under the pretext of anti-dogmatism. The activities of this group against the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany violated the interests of the entire German working class.
	The resolution said: The resolution of the 35th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will also help the German Communist Party to strengthen its ranks politically and ideologically. The German Communist Party believes that the further successful construction of socialism in the German Democratic Republic is of decisive significance for consolidating peace, which will contribute to the bankruptcy of the aggressive policies of the West German ruling group and facilitate the smooth realization of the policy of restoring German unity through the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys.

    德国统一社会党制止宗派活动
    德共中央政治局表示拥护
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社柏林24日讯：德国共产党中央委员会政治局通过决议，欢迎德国统一社会党中央委员会第三十五次全会的结果并且拥护这次全会关于希德万、沃维伯等人的集团的宗派活动问题的决议。
    德国共产党中央委员会政治局的决议着重指出，这些人企图借口反教条主义来改变党在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义和加强工农政权方面所采取的有成效的政策。这个集团反对德国统一社会党领导的活动是违反整个德国工人阶级的利益的。
    决议说：德国统一社会党中央委员会第三十五次全体会议的决议也将帮助德国共产党在政治上和思想上加强自己的队伍。德国共产党认为在德意志民主共和国进一步成功地建设社会主义对于巩固和平具有决定性的意义，这将促使西德统治集团的侵略政策破产，并且促使通过建立两个德国的邦联来恢复德国统一的政策顺利实现。
