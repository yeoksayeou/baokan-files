I completely agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Director Wu Yuzhang.

From my personal experience at the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, I believe that the State Council's national economic plan for this year is fully in line with the ardent wishes of the vast majority of workers and the current situation of a great leap forward in production. The key to realizing this plan lies in leaders believing in the power of the masses and fully supporting and developing their enthusiasm and creativity.

Since the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory carried out the "Great Blooming and Contending," "Great Rectification and Improvement," and socialist education movement last October, the relationship between leaders and the masses has greatly improved, and the masses' sense of responsibility as masters has greatly increased. In the past, the masses were not able to speak their minds freely to cadres, or subordinates to superiors, and there was still a bit of "unnaturalness." However, after this rectification movement, the masses not only said everything they wanted to say, but also saw with their own eyes that the leadership, based on everyone's opinions, resolutely corrected shortcomings and improved work; the leadership went deep into the workshops to help the masses solve problems in a timely manner, went deep into the dormitories to talk with the masses, and cadres participated in physical labor like ordinary workers. All of this made the masses intimately realize that the workers' opinions were valued by the leadership, and the relationship between cadres and workers became closer. The masses were in a good mood and felt full of energy, wanting to dedicate all their strength to society. At this moment, the Party put forward the call to catch up with Britain, and a vigorous and lively upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy by catching up with the advanced, tapping potential, and thinking of ways was launched.

With the masses mobilized, the face of production changed. The indicators that the leadership considered advanced, the masses said were conservative; problems that had not been solved for a long time were now solved smoothly.

With the masses mobilized, the face of production changed. The indicators that the leadership considered advanced, the masses said were conservative; problems that had not been solved for a long time were now solved smoothly; things that the leadership thought were impossible, the masses came up with many ways to do. When our factory discussed the 1958 national plan at the beginning of the year, the leadership proposed producing 2,000 diesel engines for the whole year; after discussion by workshop cadres, it was raised to 2,200 units; after discussion by workers, it rose again to 2,400 units, an increase of 62.5% over the 1957 output. The original plan was to produce 155,000 oil pump nozzles per year, but after discussion by the masses, it was raised to 210,000 units, an increase of 110% over the 1957 output. An important feature of this year's production upsurge is that it not only pays attention to increasing output, but also pays attention to increasing product variety and reducing costs. The original plan was for our factory to reduce costs by 1.7% compared to last year, but after the upsurge, the leadership felt that the original target was too conservative and revised it to 10%. After discussion by the masses, everyone expressed their support and endorsement. The original decision was that the 120-horsepower new diesel engine designed by our factory itself would be successfully trial-produced next year, but now the masses are striving to trial-produce it this year. In order to actively support agricultural production, our factory is preparing to trial-produce gas generators this year. In order to strive to catch up with the technical level of advanced countries in the field of power machinery, we have also decided to jointly trial-produce free pistons and gas turbines with the Shanghai Power Research Institute and the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory this year. The output is so large, there are so many advanced new products, and the costs have to be reduced. Such an annual task was something that we dared not even think about in the past.

The masses demonstrated endless wisdom and unexpected strength, solving many difficult problems. This proves that the advanced plan is practical and feasible, not just a temporary impulsive fantasy of the masses.

Perhaps some people will ask: Is such a plan a temporary impulsive fantasy of the masses? No. The masses proved that this plan is practical and feasible. They demonstrated endless wisdom and unexpected strength, solved many difficult problems, and found many tricks to improve efficiency. For example, the leadership believed that the weak link in increasing the production of diesel engines was that the existing boring machines could not produce any more; however, in the discussion, the masses pointed out that there were still many idle hours on the boring machines, mainly because the lifting equipment was not sufficient and the production line was too long. As long as a jib crane was added (which would not cost much) and the production line was slightly adjusted, the parts for three more diesel engines could be bored every day, and 900 more diesel engines could be produced in a year. While improving the utilization rate of boring machines, the masses also thought that they should be prepared for any accidents on the boring machines, so a worker suggested that our factory should imitate the "universal boring head" ourselves. With this tool, as long as it is installed on a flat plate, it is equivalent to adding a simple special boring machine, and one "boring head" can at least share 30% of the task of a universal boring machine. This suggestion was actually made several years ago, but at that time, many people thought that the technology was too complicated and we could not do it, so we never dared to try it. In this production upsurge, in order to achieve the goal of increasing production, the technical staff plucked up the courage to overcome all difficulties and make this "boring head." Now the trial production of the "boring head" has begun, and the masses have great confidence and are full of energy. Some people are unwilling to rest even on Sundays and are wholeheartedly studying technical problems, and it is estimated that the trial production can be completed in the second quarter. In this way, the first "checkpoint" blocking the increase in diesel engine production was broken through. Also, the leadership believed that if the output of diesel engines was greatly increased, the production area of the foundry workshop in our factory would not be enough, and some of the castings would have to be outsourced to other factories for cooperation. After the masses in the foundry workshop had a heated discussion on this issue, everyone believed that the castings should be done by our factory as much as possible, because the price of cooperative parts is almost twice as high as the cost of our factory, and more importantly, the quality is not guaranteed and the supply is not timely. In order to solve the problem of insufficient production area, the masses proposed to change the cylinder liner, which occupies a lot of area, to centrifugal casting to replace die casting. This method not only saves production area, but also saves raw materials; in addition to the price difference of cooperative parts, it is estimated that adopting this suggestion can save more than 100,000 yuan a year. As soon as the problem of insufficient production area in the foundry workshop was spread, it immediately received the active support of the workers in the cold working workshop. They believe that the water tanks at both ends of the diesel engine are now cast, which are bulky and take up space, and can be stamped out of copper sheets, and they took the initiative to make a sample and send it to the leadership to prove that their opinion is achievable. In this way, not only the difficulty of insufficient production area in the foundry workshop is alleviated, but also materials can be saved and costs can be reduced. Originally, everyone always thought that saving the cost of outsourced parts was the job of the purchasing staff of the supply department, and it was difficult for others to help; however, because when discussing the national plan this year, we mobilized the masses to seriously discuss and find ways to reduce costs, the old worker Chen Jingen and the third-level worker Zhu Baogen in the assembly workshop accidentally saw a voltage regulator produced in Tianjin in the electrical equipment company, which was 20% cheaper than the voltage regulator produced in Nanjing used by our factory. They took the initiative to report this discovery to the leadership. After buying it for testing, the quality fully met the requirements. By adopting this suggestion, it is estimated that the cost can be reduced by 80,000 yuan for the whole year. After the comrades in the supply department heard this news, they felt very ashamed and immediately held a group meeting to review the past shortcomings, and were determined to muster their energy to reduce the cost of purchasing other outsourced parts by an estimated 100,000 yuan this year. This is how the upsurge changed everyone's work attitude, not shirking each other, but rushing to do it.

As long as enterprise leaders adopt a positive attitude, believe in the power of the masses, and rely on the enthusiasm of the masses, they are fully qualified to implement the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical.

Comrades, from the facts I have cited above, we can see that the enthusiasm of the masses for production is very high, and a revolutionary spirit is now prevalent throughout the country. Under this situation, leading the way, actively organizing a new leap forward in the national economy, can promote the socialist construction cause to develop faster and better, and the wish of the people of the whole country, who are looking forward to building our country into a socialist power, can be realized sooner. At the same time, it can also be explained that many of our enterprises still have great potential. As long as the enterprise leaders adopt a positive attitude, believe in the power of the masses, and rely on the enthusiasm of the masses, they are fully qualified to comprehensively implement the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. In the past, for a period of time, some of our leaders did not have enough understanding of this point, and as a result, they not only failed to achieve more and faster, but also failed to achieve better and more economical, but instead hindered the development of potential forces in all aspects. After this rectification movement, the masses were mobilized, and the central government put forward the correct policy in a timely manner, and various right-leaning conservative ideas were criticized, and our cause can move forward by leaps and bounds. We must consolidate the enthusiasm of the masses on the existing basis, continue to improve the awareness of the masses, support the advanced initiatives of the masses, promote advanced experience, and lead production to a new upsurge.

Dear representatives: The face of the motherland is changing rapidly, and the socialist cause is advancing by leaps and bounds. What power is driving it? It is our Party, the working class that has seized power, and the awakened 600 million people. As Chairman Mao said, this force is as endless as a broken atomic nucleus, and no one can stop it. I am a worker who has been working for more than 50 years. After liberation, I was trained by the Party and promoted to deputy director of the factory. I will certainly live up to the Party's cultivation of me. Although I am 63 years old, I do not feel old. I will constantly be vigilant and overcome pride and complacency, learn humbly, and bring out greater enthusiasm, and work with all the workers to build our country into a great socialist power with our own hands in a short period of time.

    依靠群众没有克服不了的困难
    吴梅生代表谈上海柴油机厂职工的革命干劲
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波两位副总理以及彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的报告。
    从我在上海柴油机厂的亲身体验，认为国务院作出的今年的国民经济计划，是完全符合广大职工的热烈愿望，符合当前生产大跃进的形势的。实现这个计划的关键，在于领导者相信群众的力量，充分支持和发挥群众的积极性和创造性。
    上海柴油机厂自从去年十月进行大鸣大放、大整大改和社会主义教育运动以来，领导和群众的关系有了很大的改善，群众的主人翁责任感大大提高。过去群众对干部、下级对上级，还不能够毫无顾忌地畅所欲言，还有一点“不自然”。但是，经过这次整风运动，群众不但把想讲的话都讲了出来，而且亲眼看见领导上根据大家的意见，狠狠地改正缺点，改进工作；领导深入车间帮助群众及时解决问题，深入宿舍同群众谈心，干部像普通工人一样参加体力劳动，所有这些，使群众亲切地体会到工人的意见受到领导重视，干部和工人的关系更接近了。群众的心情舒畅了，觉得浑身都是劲，要为社会献出一切力量。正在这个时候，党提出了赶上英国的号召，于是一个赶先进、挖潜力、想办法的增产节约热潮，就生龙活虎地掀起来了。
    群众发动起来，生产面貌改变。领导上认为先进的指标，群众说是保守了；长期没有解决的问题，现在顺利解决了。
    群众发动起来，生产面貌就变了样。领导上认为先进的指标，群众说保守了；长期没有解决的问题，现在顺利解决了；领导上以为没有办法的事，群众想出许多办法来了。我们厂在年初讨论一九五八年国家计划的时候，领导上提出全年生产柴油机二千台；经过车间干部讨论，就提高到二千二百台；再经过工人讨论又上升到二千四百台，比一九五七年产量提高百分之六十二点五。油泵油嘴原计划年产十五万五千只，经过群众讨论以后，提高到二十一万只，比一九五七年产量提高百分之一百一十。今年生产高潮的一个重要特点，是不仅注意增加产量，而且注意增加产品种类和降低成本。原来计划今年我们厂成本比去年降低百分之一点七，但在高潮后，领导上感到原订指标太保守了，修正为百分之十，群众讨论以后，一致表示支持、拥护。原来决定我们厂自己设计的一百二十马力新型柴油机，要在明年试制成功，现在群众争取要在今年试制出来。为了积极支援农业生产，我们厂今年准备试制煤气机。为了在动力机械方面努力赶上先进国家的技术水平，我们还决定今年同上海动力研究所、上海汽轮机厂共同试制自由活塞和燃气轮机。产量这样的大，高级新产品又这样多，成本呢，又要降低。像这样的年度任务，过去是连想也不敢想的。
    群众表现出无穷无尽的智慧和意想不到的力量，解决了许多困难问题。这证明订的先进计划是切实可行的，并不是群众一时热情冲动的空想。
    也许有人要问：这样的计划是不是群众一时热情冲动的空想？不。群众证明了这个计划是切实可行的。他们表现出无穷无尽的智慧和意想不到的力量，解决了许多困难问题，找出了许多提高效率的窍门。例如，领导上认为增产柴油机的薄弱环节，是现有的搪床没办法再多出生活；可是，群众在讨论中，指出搪床的闲置工时还很多，主要原因是起重设备不够用，生产路线太长，只要增加一台摇臂吊车（费钱不多），和稍稍调整生产路线，就可以每天多搪三台柴油机的零件，一年可以多出产九百台柴油机。在提高搪床利用率的同时，群众还想到应该为搪床万一发生意外做好准备，所以有一位工人提出我们厂自己仿制“万能搪头”，有了这个工具，只要把它装在平板上，就等于增加了一台简单的专用搪床，一个“搪头”可以至少分担一台万能搪床任务的百分之三十。这个建议其实早在几年以前就提出来了，那时候许多人认为技术太复杂，我们做不了，一直不敢尝试；这次生产高潮中，为了实现增产的目标，技术人员鼓足勇气要克服一切困难，做成这种“搪头”。现在“搪头”的试制工作已经开始，群众信心很大，劲头十足，有些人连星期日也不愿意休息，一心一意地钻研技术问题，估计到第二季度就可以试制完成了。这样，阻挡柴油机增产的第一个“关口”被突破了。还有，领导上认为：如果大量增产柴油机，本厂铸工车间的生产面积就不够用，必须把一部分铸件请外厂协作。这个问题经过铸工车间的群众热烈讨论，大家认为铸件应当尽量由本厂自己做，因为协作件的价格比本厂成本几乎高一倍，更重要的是质量缺乏保证、供应不及时。为了解决生产面积不够用的问题，群众提出把占面积很多的气缸套改为离心浇铸，来代替模铸，这个办法不但节省生产面积，而且可以节约原材料；加上协作件的差价，估计采用这个建议，一年可以节约十几万元。铸工车间生产面积不足的问题一传出去，立即得到冷作车间职工的积极支援。他们认为，现在柴油机水箱两端的水槽是铸造的，既笨重又占地方，完全可以用铜皮冲压出来，并且主动做了一个样品送给领导上，证明他们的意见是做得到的。这样，不但减轻了铸工车间生产面积不足的困难，而且，还可以节省材料，降低成本。本来，大家总认为节约外购件的费用，是供应科采购员的事，别人很难帮忙；可是，由于今年讨论国家计划时，我们发动群众认真讨论想办法来降低成本，结果装配车间的老工人陈金根同三级工朱宝根，有一次偶然在电工器材公司看到一种天津出品的电压调节器，比本厂采用的南京出品的电压调节器价格便宜百分之二十，就把这个发现主动向领导上汇报，经过买来试验以后，质量完全符合要求。采用了这个建议，估计全年可以降低成本八万元。供应科的同志们知道这个消息以后，感觉很惭愧，马上召开小组会，检查过去的缺点，并决心鼓起干劲，要在今年采购其他外购件方面降低成本预计有十万元。高潮就是这样改变了大家的工作态度，不是互相推拖，而是抢着干了。
    只要企业领导采取积极态度，相信群众力量，依靠群众的积极性，就完全有条件贯彻执行多快好省的建设方针。
    同志们，从我上面所举的事实可以看出，现在群众的生产热情是很高的，目前全国普遍出现革命的劲头。在这种形势下，领导上因势利导，积极组织国民经济的新跃进，就可以促进社会主义建设事业发展得快一些、好一些，全国人民日夜盼望的把我国建设成一个社会主义强国的心愿，也就可以早一点实现了。同时，还可以说明，我们有不少企业的潜力还很大，只要企业领导采取积极态度，相信群众力量，依靠群众的积极性，就完全有条件全面贯彻多、快、好、省的建设方针。过去有一个时期，我们有些领导人员对这一点认识不够，结果非但不能多、快，也不能好、省，反而妨害了各方面潜在力量的发挥。经过这次整风运动，群众发动起来，中央及时提出正确的方针，各种右倾保守思想受到批判，我们的事业就可以大踏步前进了。我们必须在目前已有的基础上，巩固群众的热情，继续提高群众的觉悟，支持群众的先进倡议，推广先进经验，把生产引向新的高涨。
    各位代表：祖国的面貌在迅速地变化着，社会主义事业在飞跃地前进着，是什么力量推动的呢？是我们的党，是掌握了政权的工人阶级，是觉醒了的六亿人民。这股力量正如毛主席说的，如同冲破了的原子核一样是无穷无尽的，是谁也阻挡不了的。我是一个工人，做了五十多年工了，解放后经过党的培养，提拔为副厂长，我一定不辜负党对我的培养。我虽已六十三岁了，但并不感到老，我一定不断地警惕与克服骄傲自满，虚心学习，拿出更大的干劲，和全体工人同志一起，用我们自己的双手在短时期内，把我们的国家建设成一个伟大的社会主义强国。
