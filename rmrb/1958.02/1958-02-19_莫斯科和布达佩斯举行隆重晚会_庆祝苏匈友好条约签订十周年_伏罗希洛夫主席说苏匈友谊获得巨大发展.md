Xinhua News Agency, February 18th - TASS reports: February 18th marks the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. On the eve of this day (February 17th), a celebration was held in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in Moscow.

    Komarov, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Zhukov, Chairman of the State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Mikhailov, Minister of Culture, Padolichev, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Popova, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, representatives from all walks of life in Moscow, and Hungarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Boldoczki, attended the evening party. Zhukov, Komarov, and Boldoczki spoke at the party.

    In his speech, Boldoczki said that the Hungarian-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance expressed the mutual love and respect between the Hungarian and Soviet people, and their determination to help each other. The great significance of this treaty for Hungary is immeasurable. Since liberation, with the help of the Soviet Union, Hungary has transformed from a relatively backward agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country.

    On the evening of the 17th, a grand commemorative evening party was also held in Budapest, the capital of Hungary.

    Szamogyi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that Hungary's cooperation with the Soviet Union shows the world that large countries and small countries can coexist as equal nations. During the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956, the friendship between the Soviet and Hungarian peoples withstood the test. After the counter-revolutionary forces were crushed, the Soviet Union provided Hungary with material, political and moral assistance, once again opening the road to prosperity for the Hungarian people.

    Soviet Ambassador to Hungary, Gromov, also spoke at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, February 18th - TASS Moscow: On the eve of the tenth anniversary (February 18th) of the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, in answering questions from the Hungarian News Agency, "People's Freedom" and Hungarian Radio reporters in Moscow, said that in the ten years since the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, the friendship between the Soviet and Hungarian peoples has been further strengthened, and the two countries have seen positive developments in political, economic and cultural relations.

    The question posed to Chairman Voroshilov by the Hungarian reporters was: "How do you evaluate the relationship between the Soviet Union and Hungary in the ten years since the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance?" In his answer, Voroshilov said that the treaty is based on the Leninist principles of equality, fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, and socialist internationalism.

    Voroshilov said that the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is a solid guarantee of Hungary's security. During those difficult days when international reactionaries and domestic counter-revolutionary forces attempted to usurp the fruits of the Hungarian working people, the Soviet Union accepted the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and gave Hungary the necessary assistance. In this way, the Soviet government demonstrated its loyalty to international obligations and its loyalty to the great principles of proletarian internationalism.

    Voroshilov pointed out that the principles stated in the Soviet-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance were further developed in the joint declaration issued by the Soviet government and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government in March 1957. This declaration reaffirmed the vitality of the Leninist principles on which the countries of the socialist camp build their relations with each other.

    Voroshilov congratulated the Hungarian people on their further achievements in socialist construction.

    莫斯科和布达佩斯举行隆重晚会
    庆祝苏匈友好条约签订十周年
    伏罗希洛夫主席说苏匈友谊获得巨大发展
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社报道：2月18日是苏匈友好合作互助条约签订十周年。在这一天前夕（17日），在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了庆祝晚会。
    苏联最高苏维埃民族院副主席科马罗夫、苏联国家对外文化委员会主席茹科夫、文化部长米哈伊洛夫、外交部副部长帕多利切夫、苏联对外文化协会理事会主席波波娃和莫斯科各界代表以及匈牙利驻苏联大使波尔多茨基等参加了晚会。茹科夫、科马罗夫和波尔多茨基在晚会上讲了话。
    波尔多茨基在讲话时说，匈苏友好合作互助条约表达了匈苏两国人民互相爱戴和尊重以及他们互相帮助的决心。这个条约对匈牙利的巨大意义是难以估计的。解放以来，在苏联的帮助下，匈牙利已经从比较落后的农业——工业国变成了工业——农业国。
    17日晚，匈牙利首都布达佩斯也举行了隆重的纪念晚会。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员绍莫吉在会上讲了话。他说，匈牙利同苏联的合作向全世界表明，大国同小国是可以作为平等的国家而共处的。在1956年10月反革命叛乱期间，苏匈两国人民的友谊经受住了考验。在反革命势力被粉碎以后，苏联在物质上、政治上和道义上援助了匈牙利，再一次给匈牙利人民打开了走向繁荣的道路。
    苏联驻匈牙利大使格罗莫夫也在会上讲了话。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在苏匈友好合作互助条约签订十周年（2月18日）前夕，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫在回答匈牙利通讯社、“人民自由报”和匈牙利电台驻莫斯科记者的问题时说，苏匈友好合作互助条约签订十年来，苏匈两国人民之间的友谊进一步加强了，两国在政治、经济和文化关系上有了积极的发展。
    匈牙利记者向伏罗希洛夫主席提出的问题是：“您怎样评价苏匈友好合作互助条约签订后十年来苏匈两国的关系？”伏罗希洛夫在回答时说，这个条约是建立在列宁主义的平等、兄弟合作和互助以及社会主义国际主义原则的基础上的。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏匈友好合作互助条约是匈牙利安全的巩固保证。在国际反动派和国内反革命势力企图篡夺匈牙利劳动人民的果实的那些严重的日子里，苏联接受了匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，给匈牙利以必要的帮助。这样，苏联政府就表现了对国际义务的忠诚，对伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚。
    伏罗希洛夫指出，苏匈友好合作互助条约中陈述的原则，在1957年3月间苏联政府和匈牙利工农革命政府共同发表的宣言中得到了进一步的发展。这个宣言重申了社会主义阵营各国赖以建立彼此关系的那些列宁主义原则的生命力。
    伏罗希洛夫祝贺匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中取得进一步的成就。
