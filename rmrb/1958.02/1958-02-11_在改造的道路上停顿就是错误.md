    To Stop on the Road of Transformation is a Mistake
    In the spring of 1956, industrialists and businessmen accepted the joint state-private ownership of entire industries, which was a great leap forward in the transformation of our enterprises; now, our participation in the anti-Rightist struggle and the general rectification movement, accepting political and ideological socialist transformation, is the great leap forward in the transformation of us as individuals.
    With only economic socialist transformation, and without political and ideological socialist transformation, industrialists and businessmen can never be transformed from exploiters into genuine laborers, that is, they cannot successfully pass the test of socialism.
    Speech by Representative Chen Jingshe
    I listened with great excitement to the reports of leaders such as Li Xiannian, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, and Wu Yuzhang. In particular, the report on the state budget and national economic construction gave me the greatest encouragement. I fully support these reports. We should all do our utmost to strive to over fulfill the various targets set out in the reports.
    This year is the first year of our country's victorious start to the development of the Second Five-Year Plan for the national economy, and it will also be a year of a great leap forward in our country's economic construction. According to the current situation, a huge upsurge in the socialist construction cause is being launched on all fronts of the national economy. Chairman Mao instructed us that everyone should summon up revolutionary drive and strive for the upper reaches. I believe that this has special, intimate, and significant meaning for us industrialists and businessmen.
    Since liberation, our motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has rapidly changed its past poverty and backwardness, and will catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom, the earliest developed capitalist country, in the production of important industrial products such as steel in about fifteen years. What an exhilarating and inspiring thing this is! Faced with the great leap forward in the construction of the motherland, every conscientious and patriotic industrialist and businessman will never remain indifferent. Since liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have united, educated, and transformed us, helping us to transition from exploiters to glorious working people, and have regarded us as a wealth of the country, giving us various kinds of care and arrangements. Now, we should ask ourselves: In the great leap forward of the motherland's economic construction, how will we also summon up our drive, strive for the upper reaches, make contributions, and truly play our role as wealth?
    Through this anti-Rightist struggle, we have deeply realized that, in the upsurge of socialist transformation in 1956, although the ownership of our enterprises has basically changed, we have not undergone socialist transformation politically and ideologically. Why did the reactionary remarks of the Rightist leader Zhang Naiqi have a considerable market in our business community? Why did the so-called "Ten Dissatisfactions" reactionary arguments of Wang Yiming, a Rightist leader in Wuhan, also resonate with some people in the business community? This is because our transformation as individuals has not been completed, and the vast majority of us have not fundamentally abandoned the reactionary capitalist stance. Our motherland is striding forward on the bright road of socialism, while most of us industrialists and businessmen are still basically standing on the capitalist stance, and to varying degrees, still have a sense of resistance to the socialist system. Before our political stance is changed and our ideological feelings towards socialism are established, how can we fully play our active role and how can we advance together with the great leap forward of the motherland?
    We are deeply grateful to the Party and the government for the peaceful transformation policy they have adopted towards us, which has enabled us to happily complete the transformation of the ownership of the means of production two years ago today, and has led us onto the socialist road. However, we industrialists and businessmen should also thank the Party and the government with gratitude for carrying out political and ideological socialist transformation for us. Only with economic socialist transformation, and without political and ideological socialist transformation, we industrialists and businessmen cannot transition from exploiters to genuine laborers, that is, we cannot successfully pass the test of socialism. The reason why people like Zhang Naiqi and Wang Yiming have degenerated into Rightist elements who are despised by everyone is because they refused to continue to accept further transformation after the basic completion of enterprise transformation.
    After the basic completion of enterprise transformation, because we are still receiving fixed interest and the roots of exploitation have not been removed, our ideological feelings and living habits are still very different from those of the working people. If we stop on the road of transformation and do not move forward, it would be a great mistake. We must deeply thank the Party and the government for timely launching the anti-Rightist struggle and the general rectification movement, and after the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, leading us industrialists and businessmen to carry out political and ideological socialist transformation. We must fully recognize the great significance of political and ideological socialist transformation, and, like accepting enterprise transformation, accept the transformation of people with even more joy and excitement.
    During the period of the great leap forward in the motherland, we industrialists and businessmen must also have a great leap forward in self-transformation. In the spring of 1956, we accepted the joint state-private ownership of entire industries, which was a great leap forward in the transformation of our enterprises; now, our participation in the anti-Rightist struggle and the general rectification movement, accepting political and ideological socialist transformation, is the great leap forward in the transformation of us as individuals. Without political and ideological socialist transformation, if our political stance cannot be changed and our socialist consciousness cannot be raised, then, in the great leap forward of the motherland, we will become onlookers, or promoters of regression, or even obstacles to progress. It is absolutely impossible to be satisfied with the status quo and be satisfied with being in the middle.
    At present, some areas in our business community are still carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle, and most areas have entered the general rectification on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle. Through the anti-Rightist struggle, we have not only ferreted out many Rightist elements and discredited them thoroughly, but also enabled the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen to be tempered, to recognize the harmfulness of the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightist elements, to brighten their eyes, and to provide favorable conditions for carrying out the general rectification. However, until now, not everyone in our business community has a clear understanding of the importance and necessity of the general rectification, or is completely free of ideological concerns. No. There are still some people among us who have concerns about participating in the general rectification. For example, they believe that after the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, everyone has raised their awareness and is determined to take the socialist road, so the general rectification is not important. This statement is naturally incorrect. Rectification and anti-Rightism are closely related, but the anti-Rightist struggle is to defeat the reactionary conspiracy of the Rightists, and the rectification movement is to transform our political stance and thinking. The anti-Rightist struggle cannot replace the general rectification. Some people think that the rectification is to make us recognize which of the two roads of capitalism and socialism is inferior and which is superior, and where to go. Now we admit that we have two sides and are willing to accept the leadership of the public side and continue to accept transformation, so the general rectification is not necessary. This statement is also incorrect. Through the anti-Rightist struggle, many people have indeed raised their awareness and strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road. However, this is not the case for everyone; at the same time, even if some people have made progress, it is not that they no longer need to continue to improve and consolidate. In fact, the so-called improvement in awareness of some people is still stuck in words and on the surface, and the problem has not been solved ideologically. For example, because Rightist elements generally oppose public representatives and deny that there are still two sides, some people have expressed their acceptance of the leadership of the public side and admit that they have two sides; however, why must we accept the leadership of the public side? How can we sincerely accept leadership? And why are there still two sides? How can we overcome the two sides and take a big step to the left? And so on, these issues have not been truly understood. Therefore, this can only show that we industrialists and businessmen have an urgent need to carry out general rectification, but it is by no means that it can be dispensed with or can no longer be emphasized. These are just two examples. In addition, some people have various ideological situations, showing concerns or lack of enthusiasm for general rectification. We must explain the policies to everyone, explain the principles well, so that everyone understands the importance and necessity of general rectification, so that they, like accepting enterprise transformation, happily and cheerfully actively participate in general rectification and strive to achieve self-transformation.
    Our meeting is being held in the upsurge of socialist economic construction in our country. In order to rapidly build our motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, the people of the whole country are riding the wind and waves and exerting all their strength. We industrialists and businessmen have been taught by the Party and Chairman Mao for a long time, and except for a very small number of Rightist elements, we are all willing to accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road. We must follow the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, summon up revolutionary drive, actively participate in the rectification movement, make a firm determination, and change our stance. We must take the enterprise as the base, carry out self-transformation in work practice and labor training; practice diligence and thrift, do a good job in production, overcome all right-leaning conservative ideas, give full play to all potential forces, make due achievements, and advance together with the great leap forward of the motherland.

### 在改造的道路上停顿就是错误

    在改造的道路上停顿就是错误
    1956年春工商业者接受了全行业公私合营，是我们企业接受改造的大跃进；现在，我们参加反右派斗争和一般整风运动，接受政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，就是我们人的改造的大跃进。
    只有经济上的社会主义改造，而没有政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，工商业者决不可能从剥削者变成名副其实的劳动者，也就是不能过好社会主义这一关。
    陈经畬代表的发言
    我以非常兴奋的心情，听了李先念、彭真、薄一波、吴玉章等各位领导人的报告。特别是国家预算和国民经济建设的报告，给了我最大的鼓舞。对于这些报告，我完全拥护。我们都应该尽我们最大的力量，为超额完成报告中所规定的各项指标而奋斗。
    今年是我国胜利地开始发展国民经济第二个五年计划的第一年，也将是我国经济建设大跃进的一年。依照目前的形势来看，在国民经济的各个战线上，都正在掀起巨大的社会主义建设事业的高潮。毛主席指示我们，每个人都要鼓起革命的干劲，争取上游。我认为，这对于我们工商业者来说，更具有特别亲切和重大的意义。
    解放以来，我们的祖国在中国共产党领导下已经迅速地改变了过去的贫困和落后的面貌，将在十五年左右时间内在钢铁等重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过世界资本主义发展最早的英国。这是一件多么令人欢欣鼓舞的事情！在祖国建设大跃进的面前，每一个有良心的、爱国的工商业者，是决不会无动于衷的。解放以来，中国共产党和人民政府对我们进行团结、教育和改造，帮助我们由剥削者向光荣的劳动人民过渡，并且把我们视作国家的一项财富，给予了我们各种照顾和安排。现在，我们应该反躬自问：在祖国经济建设大跃进中，我们也将怎样鼓起干劲，力争上游，作出贡献，真正发挥我们的财富作用呢？
    经过这次反右派斗争，我们深刻地认识到，在一九五六年社会主义改造高潮中，我们企业的所有制固然基本上改变，但是我们在政治上和思想上还没有经过社会主义改造。右派头子章乃器的反动言论为什么在我们工商界会有相当大的市场？我们武汉的右派头子王一鸣的所谓“十大不满”的反动论调，为什么也会引起工商界一部分人的共鸣？这就是由于我们人的改造还没有完成，我们中间极大多数人基本上还没有抛弃反动的资本主义立场的原故。我们的祖国在社会主义光明大道上迈步前进，而我们工商业者多数的人还基本上站在资本主义立场，对社会主义制度在不同程度上还存在抵触情绪。在我们的政治立场没有改变、我们对社会主义的思想感情还没有建立以前，我们怎样能够充分发挥我们的积极作用，怎样能够随着祖国的大跃进而一起前进呢？
    我们深深地感谢党和政府对我们所采取的和平改造政策，使我们能够在两年前的今天，兴高采烈地基本完成生产资料所有制的变革，使我们走上了社会主义道路。但是，我们工商业者同样应该以万分感激的心情，感谢党和政府对我们进行政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，只有经济上的社会主义改造，而没有政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，我们工商业者是决不能够由剥削者过渡到名副其实的劳动者，也就是不能过好社会主义这一关的。像章乃器、王一鸣之类的人，所以会堕落成为人人唾弃的右派分子，就是由于在企业改造基本完成后，拒绝继续接受进一步的改造的原故。
    在企业改造基本完成后，由于我们还在拿定息，剥削的根子还没有除去，我们的思想感情和生活习惯，同劳动人民还有很大的距离。如果我们在改造的道路上就停顿下来，不再前进，那是极大的错误。我们要深深地感谢党和政府及时地开展了反右派斗争和全民整风运动，在经济战线上社会主义革命胜利以后，又领导我们工商业者进行政治上和思想上的社会主义改造。我们必须充分认识政治上和思想上社会主义改造的重大意义，要和接受企业改造一样，以更为欢天喜地、兴高采烈的心情，来接受人的改造。
    在祖国大跃进时期，我们工商业者在自我改造方面，也必须来一个大跃进。一九五六年春我们接受了全行业公私合营，是我们企业接受改造的大跃进；现在，我们参加反右派斗争和一般整风运动，接受政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，就是我们人的改造的大跃进。如果没有政治上和思想上的社会主义改造，我们的政治立场不能改变，社会主义觉悟不能提高，那末，在祖国的大跃进中，我们就会成为一个旁观者，或者是促退派，甚至是前进中的阻碍。要想安于现状，安于中间，是决不可能的。
    现在，我们工商界有的地区还在进行反右派斗争，大部分地区都已在反右派斗争胜利的基础上正在先后转入一般整风。通过反右派斗争，我们不仅揪出了不少的右派分子，把他们斗臭斗透，而且使极大多数工商业者受到了锻炼，认识到右派分子的反动言行的危害性，擦亮了自己的眼睛，为开展一般整风提供了有利的条件。但是，直到现在，对于一般整风的重要性和必要性，我们工商业者并不是每一个人都已有了清楚的认识，或者思想上都已没有顾虑。不是的。我们中间还有一些人对于参加一般整风是存在着顾虑的。例如，他们认为反右派斗争胜利后，大家都已提高了认识，决心走社会主义道路，一般整风就无关重要了。这种说法自然是不对的。整风和反右有密切的联系，但是，反右派斗争是击垮右派的反动阴谋，整风运动是改造我们的政治立场和思想，反右派斗争决不能代替一般整风。有些人认为，整风是为了使我们认识资本主义和社会主义两条道路谁劣谁优、何去何从问题，现在我们承认自己有两面性，愿意接受公方领导，继续接受改造，所以一般整风就没有必要了。这种说法也是不正确的。通过反右派斗争，不少的人确实提高了认识，坚定了走社会主义道路的信心。但是，这并不是所有的人都是这样；同时，即使有的人有了进步，也并不是不再需要继续提高和巩固。事实上，有些人的所谓认识提高，也还停止在口头上和表面上，在思想上并没有解决问题。例如，由于右派分子一般都反对公方代表，否认还有两面性，因而有些人就表示接受公方领导，承认有两面性；但是，为什么一定要接受公方领导？怎样才能做到真心诚意地接受领导？以及为什么还有两面性？怎样才能克服两面性而向左转一大步？等等，对于这些问题是并没有真正认识的。所以，这只能说明我们工商业者有迫切进行一般整风的必要，而决不是可以不要或者可以不再重视一般整风。这只是举二个例子。此外，有一些人还有各种各样的思想情况，表现出对于一般整风有顾虑或者不够积极。我们一定要向大家交代政策，好好地说明道理，使大家了解一般整风的重要性和必要性，从而使他们和接受企业改造一样，兴高采烈、身心愉快地来积极参加一般整风，努力实现自我改造。
    我们这次会议是在我国社会主义经济建设高潮中召开的。为了迅速地把我们祖国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，全国人民正在乘风破浪，发挥自己的一切力量。我们工商业者长时期受到党和毛主席教导，除了人数极少的右派分子以外，都是愿意接受党的领导，走社会主义道路的。我们一定要遵照党和毛主席的指示，鼓起革命的干劲，积极参加整风运动，痛下决心，改变立场。我们一定要以企业为基地，在工作实践和劳动锻炼中，进行自我改造；勤俭节约，搞好生产，克服一切右倾保守思想，发挥一切潜在力量，做出应有的成绩，随着祖国的大跃进而一起前进。
