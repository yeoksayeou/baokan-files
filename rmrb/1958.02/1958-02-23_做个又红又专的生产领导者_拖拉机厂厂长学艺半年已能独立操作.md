    Be a Production Leader Who is Both Red and Expert
    Tractor Factory Director Learns Skills for Half a Year and Can Now Operate Independently
    Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang: On the first day of the Spring Festival, Liu Gang, the director of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, paid a New Year's visit to his master, lathe worker Wang Yongsheng.
    For more than half a year, Liu Gang has been working in the workshop alongside the workers to learn production technology, and he has become very familiar with them.
    After being transferred to the tractor factory as director in 1955, Liu Gang was determined to become an industrial production leader who was both red and expert. For more than two years, he has used his spare time to complete the basic knowledge of metal technology, machine manufacturing technology, and industrial production technologies such as grinding, turning, forging, and heat treatment, as well as courses at the university's engineering college. Since May of last year, he has also gone to the workshop and apprenticed himself to Wang Yongsheng, a sixth-grade lathe worker. He spends two afternoons a week personally operating the machines and learning production technology. After more than half a year of study, he can now operate independently and do the work of a third-grade lathe worker. This year, he plans to basically reach the level of a fourth-grade technician and strive to do some of the work of a fifth-grade technician.

    做个又红又专的生产领导者
    拖拉机厂厂长学艺半年已能独立操作
    据新华社洛阳讯　春节第一天，第一拖拉机制造厂厂长刘刚，曾给他的老师傅车工王永生拜年。
    半年多来，刘刚下车间和工人共同劳动，学习生产技术，已经和工人们混得很熟了。
    刘刚从1955年转业到拖拉机厂当厂长后，决心要做一个又红又专的工业生产领导者。两年多来，他利用业余时间学完了金属工艺学、机器制造工艺学，以及磨工、车工、锻工、热处理等工业生产技术基本知识和大学工学院的课程。从去年5月，他又下车间，拜了六级车工王永生为师傅，每个星期抽出两个下午，下车间亲自操作，学习生产技术。经过半年多来的学习，现在他已经能独立操作，作三级车工的活。今年他计划要基本上达到四级技工的水平，争取做部分五级技工的活。
