Xinhua News Agency report:

　　In Hong'an County, Hubei Province, everyone knows about Xu Dama (Old Woman Xu).

　　Xu Dama’s name is Xu Zhengxiu, and she is now seventy-two years old. More than thirty years ago, her husband and eldest son joined the Red Army, and Xu Dama was also elected as a member of the township Soviet Women's Association. In those days, she mobilized women everywhere to wash clothes and make shoes for the Red Army, support the front lines, and also organized comfort teams and farming teams to do work and cultivate fields for the families of Red Army soldiers. Later, her husband died, and her eldest son also went north with the main force of the Red Army (sacrificed on the way north), while she remained in place to persist in the struggle. In an attempt to find out the whereabouts of the Red Army from her, the enemy beat her until she bled profusely and fainted several times, but she remained steadfast. She firmly believed that the Red Army would return and the revolution would be victorious.

　　The War of Resistance Against Japan began, and the New Fourth Army came to Hong'an. Xu Dama risked her life to get in touch with the Party again, and secretly sent grain and scouted intelligence for the New Fourth Army, persisting until liberation.

　　In the spring of 1953, the first mutual aid team appeared in Wansheng Township. This mutual aid team was organized by Xu Dama in response to the Party's call. The following year, she led the transformation of this mutual aid team of only fourteen households into a primary cooperative – the Spark Agricultural Cooperative. In the early days of running the cooperative, she served as the vice director of the cooperative. Despite encountering many difficulties at the time, none of them made this old woman retreat. Later, the cooperative was well-managed. Under the influence of this cooperative, and through her patient mobilization, in the winter of 1955, all fifty-four households in the village joined the cooperative, and the original primary cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative. In the past two years, the cooperative has increased production year after year, especially last year. The members praised Xu Dama in this way: "With Dama as our leader, our lives are improving step by step."

　　Since liberation, Xu Dama has been named a model worker of the province, prefecture, and county six times, and at the age of sixty-eight, she gloriously joined the Party and became a Communist Party member. In 1956 and 1957, she went to Beijing twice to attend the National Conference of Activists in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families and Demobilized Soldiers and the Third National Women's Congress. People compare Xu Dama to a "doctor" who cures ideological illnesses. They say: If you have a "disease," you will be cured as soon as you think of Xu Dama. (Edited by this newspaper)

    在湖北省红安县，人们都知道有个徐大妈。
    徐大妈名叫徐正修，现在已经七十二岁了。三十多年以前，她的丈夫和大儿子参加了红军，徐大妈也被选为乡苏维埃妇女会的委员。在那些日子里，她到处发动妇女，为红军洗衣、做鞋，支援前线，还组织慰问队、代耕队，替红军家属做活种田。后来，她的丈夫牺牲了，她的大儿子也随红军主力北上（在北上途中牺牲），而她则留在原地坚持斗争。敌人为了企图从她嘴里探出红军的动向，曾经把她打得鲜血直流，几次昏死，但她始终坚贞不屈。她深信：红军一定会回来，革命一定会胜利的。
    抗日战争开始了，新四军来到了红安。徐大妈冒着生命危险又同党取得了联系，并且秘密地为新四军送粮食、探情报，一直坚持到解放。
    1953年春天，万胜乡出现了第一个互助组。这个互助组是徐大妈响应党的号召组织的。到了第二年，她又领导着把这个只有十四户的互助组转成初级社——星火农业社。在办社初期，她担任了社的副主任，尽管当时碰到许许多多困难，都没有使这位老人退缩。以后，合作社办好了。在这个社的影响下，又经过她耐心动员，1955年冬天，全村五十四户人家全入了社，原来的初级社这时也转成了高级社。这两年，社里连年增产，特别是去年增产更多。社员们这样赞颂着徐大妈：“有了大妈这个带头人，我们的生活步步升”。
    解放以来，徐大妈先后六次被评为省、专区、县的模范，在六十八岁时又光荣地参加了党，成为共产党员。1956年、1957年，她曾经两次到北京出席全国烈军属复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会和全国第三次妇女代表大会。人们都把徐大妈比作是一个治思想病的“医生”，他们说：有了“病”，只要一想到徐大妈就会好的。（本报作了删节）（附图片）
    在日常生活中徐大妈也不感到孤独，每日都有一群青年男女帮助她料理家务。图为共青团员叶秀兰（左）帮助大妈做饭。　新华社记者　李九龄摄
