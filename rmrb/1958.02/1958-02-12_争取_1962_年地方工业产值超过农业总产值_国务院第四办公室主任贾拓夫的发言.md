I would like to offer some opinions on vigorously developing local industry.

In the past two weeks, the People's Daily has published four more inspiring news reports. These are the goals proposed by the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, and Jiangxi: to strive to have the output value of local industry exceed the total output value of agriculture by 1962, or a little later. The proposal of this grand leap forward goal undoubtedly has national significance. It points to a new situation and new tasks that will inevitably emerge in local industry nationwide, following the high tide of agricultural production and the high tide of industrial construction.

**The New Situation and New Tasks of Local Industry**

The actual situation of the First Five-Year Plan indicates that, on the one hand, the increase in the output value of local industry largely depends on the development of agricultural production. On the other hand, the growth rate of the output value of local industry will greatly exceed the growth rate of agricultural production. Precisely because of this, the ratio of the total output value of local industry to the total output value of agriculture nationwide has changed from approximately 1:2 in 1952 to 1:1.5 in 1957. During the Second Five-Year Plan, as long as local industry maintains a development speed twice that of agriculture, the ratio of the output value of local industry to the total output value of agriculture can be further increased from 1:1.5 to 1:1, or even the former exceeding the latter. Assuming that the growth rate of agricultural production averages around 7% to 10% per year in the future, then an average annual growth of around 14% to 20% for local industry can enable the output value of local industry to catch up with the total output value of agriculture. Therefore, the proposals of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Anhui provinces to have the output value of local industry catch up with the total output value of agriculture by 1962 are based on objective grounds.

The situation of the proportion of local industrial output value to agricultural output value in each province last year shows that Shaanxi, Anhui, and Gansu, which have a relatively weak foundation, can make the output value of local industry catch up with the total output value of agriculture in 1962, and most provinces in the country have no reason not to be able to do so.

In 1957, it is estimated that the proportion of local industrial output value in each province and region to the total output value of local industry and agriculture combined in the province is roughly as follows: there is one province (Liaoning) where the output value of local industry accounts for more than half and exceeds the total output value of agriculture; there are three provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jilin) where it accounts for less than half but is close to the total output value of agriculture; there are four provinces (Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Sichuan) where it accounts for about one-third; and there are eleven provinces where it accounts for about one-quarter. Shaanxi, Anhui, and Jiangxi belong to this category. The remaining provinces are between 15% and 20%, and Gansu province belongs to this category. If Shaanxi, Anhui, and Gansu, which currently have a relatively weak foundation in local industry, can make the output value of local industry catch up with the total output value of agriculture in 1962 or a little later, then most provinces and regions in the country have no reason not to be able to do so.

Local industry and agricultural production are very closely related. Therefore, the current surging development of the high tide of agricultural production and the high tide of industrial construction will inevitably drive the unprecedented development of local industry. If we underestimate this new situation, we will make mistakes.

The vast majority of local industries are consumer goods that process agricultural products and means of production that serve agricultural production. About 90% of the consumer goods in the country are produced by local industries, and a considerable portion of the means of production that serve agricultural production are also produced by local industries. At present, most of these products are in short supply, and there is an objective and urgent need to vigorously develop them. In addition, local industries also produce a large number of export goods and produce various indispensable collaborative products to support large-scale industrial construction. In both of these aspects, the future development prospects are also very broad. It can be seen that local industry is closely integrated with agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people, and its development will first depend on the development of agricultural production, because only the development of agricultural production can provide local industry with sufficient raw materials and a broad market. Conversely, the development of local industry is an indispensable condition for promoting agricultural production, because without the development of local industry, it is impossible to supply agriculture with the necessary means of production, and it is impossible to process a large number of agricultural products into industrial products to meet social needs. At the same time, local industry is an indispensable assistant to large-scale industrial construction and an important source of foreign exchange. Therefore, it can be concluded that the current surging development of the high tide of agricultural production and the high tide of industrial construction will inevitably drive these main parts of local industry to achieve unprecedented development during the Second Five-Year Plan. This is a new situation that will appear before us, and this new situation will inevitably replace the old situation during the First Five-Year Plan, in which the production potential of local industry, especially consumer goods, could not be fully utilized due to insufficient supply of agricultural raw materials. If we underestimate this new situation, our work will lag behind the development of the objective situation, and we will inevitably commit conservative errors.

There are five favorable conditions for striving for a great leap forward in local industry: Local industry has the potential to flourish everywhere in rural areas; Although the development of each province and region is uneven, it will promote a common upsurge under the guidance of the state plan; Local initiative will be further developed; The production enthusiasm of workers will be unprecedentedly high; Strong support from all aspects.

Here, in striving for a great leap forward in local industry, the following favorable conditions must also be pointed out:

First, the superiority of China's socialist system and the implementation of the policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry will enable industry and agriculture and animal husbandry to be closely integrated, and local industry has the potential to flourish everywhere in rural areas.

Second, after several years of development, China's local industry generally has a fairly strong foundation. Although the development in each province and region is uneven, this unevenness will promote a common upsurge in all provinces and regions under the guidance of the state plan.

Third, the improvement of the state's industrialization, commercial finance, and other management systems will further enhance local initiative, thereby being more conducive to the development of local industry.

Fourth, the vast number of workers and masses in local industry have a spirit of diligence, bravery, hard work, and in-depth research. In particular, after the rectification campaign and the great debate, their political and ideological awareness has been further improved, and their enthusiasm and creativity will be further developed, and their production enthusiasm will be unprecedentedly high.

Fifth, under the correct leadership of the Party, China's local industry will receive strong support from all aspects. With the above conditions, it is of course possible for most provinces and regions in the country to realize the great ideal of making the output value of local industry exceed the total output value of agriculture within five years or a little longer.

Several tasks that should be done well at present

In order to vigorously develop local industry under the new situation, it goes without saying that a lot of in-depth and meticulous hard work is needed. At present, special attention should be paid to doing the following main tasks well:

Fully exploit raw material resources

First, we must fully tap the potential of raw material resources.

Raw materials in areas with convenient transportation have been or are beginning to be utilized; wild raw materials in mountainous areas are rarely or not utilized; some of the raw materials that are utilized are only used in part, and there is no comprehensive utilization. This shows that there is great potential in raw materials.

In recent years, local industry, especially light industry production, has often encountered difficulties due to insufficient raw materials, which has affected the speed of industrial development. Can we overcome the raw material difficulties and strive for a great development of local industry? I think it is possible. Because the potential of raw materials is still very large. From the perspective of raw material utilization, raw materials in large, concentrated areas with convenient transportation have been utilized or are beginning to be utilized; for those small, scattered, wild raw materials in areas with inconvenient transportation, they are rarely utilized or not utilized at all; even among the raw materials that have been utilized, there are still many raw materials that are only used in part, and their by-products have not been comprehensively utilized. From the perspective of raw material production, the yield per unit area of various cash crops is constantly increasing, and the quality is also gradually improving. On the premise of not affecting or minimally affecting grain yield, the planting area of cash crops can also be appropriately expanded; as for those wild materials that can be used as industrial raw materials such as fiber, starch, and fat, utilizing them will inevitably promote their development.

Planting sunflowers on 20 million mu of saline-alkali and low-lying land will increase the national average of edible oil by 1.7 jin per person.

Taking oil as an example, in the past few years, due to the shortage of oil, the average amount of edible oil distributed to the national population of our country is still relatively low. At present, the agricultural sector is actively planning and taking measures to strive to increase the yield per unit area and stabilize the area of oil crops; it is also considering increasing the planting of peanuts in red soil and sandy wasteland areas, planting sunflowers and other oilseeds in saline-alkali and low-lying areas, and increasing the planting of woody oilseeds in mountainous areas. Some agricultural cooperatives in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, have tried planting sunflowers on saline-alkali land, with an average yield of about 250 jin per mu, which can extract 60 to 70 jin of oil. Feeding pigs with sunflower discs and sunflower oil cakes produced per mu can exceed the benefits of grain produced per mu. Adding the 60 to 70 jin of oil extracted is equivalent to more than three times the income from planting grain in a considerable area. Years of practice have proved that sunflowers have the advantages of being alkali-resistant, drought-resistant, and flood-resistant. There are 140 million mu of low-lying land and more than 300 million mu of saline-alkali land in the country. If 20 million mu of saline-alkali land and low-lying land are used to plant sunflowers, with an average yield of 200 jin per mu, 540,000 tons of vegetable oil can be increased in one year, which is equivalent to increasing the national average of edible oil by 1.7 jin per person. Not to mention that sunflower, castor bean, and other oil crops can be planted on roadsides, riversides, village edges, and other gaps.

The economic value of planting sugar beets on saline-alkali land is also very high. Wild fruits for winemaking can save a lot of grain.

The situation of sugar crops is roughly the same. The economic benefits of planting sugar beets on saline-alkali land are comparable to those of sunflowers. In addition to being used for sugar production, each mu of sugar beets can be used to feed livestock only with the stems, leaves, and waste silk of sugar beets, which is equivalent to more than one mu of sorghum production. In some low-yielding grain areas and dead-end grain areas in the south, sugarcane can be planted, and the yield per mu is similar to that of sugar beets.

In the winemaking industry, recently, relevant ministries and regions of the central government have initially studied wild fruits and opened up a broad avenue for winemaking raw materials. Among them, only acorns are said to have an estimated annual output of about 8 billion jin nationwide. If half of them are used for winemaking, about 400,000 tons of wine can be produced, which is equivalent to the amount of wine produced from more than 900,000 tons of corn.

Sugarcane bagasse may become an important raw material for textile and papermaking.

Brick making with furnace ash and cement making with furnace slag are of good quality.

The raw materials for the textile industry are very unstable. All localities have paid attention to the issue of increasing cotton production, and are actively planning to cultivate and increase the production of silkworm cocoons, wool, and hemp. In addition, all localities are actively studying the use of wild fibers, such as degummed flax and apocynum to blend with cotton; cotton stalks and yellow ramie are used to blend sacks. The cotton stalks planned to be used in 1958 can weave more than 1 million sacks. The Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry has achieved preliminary results in trial-producing pulp for artificial fibers from sugarcane bagasse. It seems that sugarcane bagasse is very likely to become an important raw material for the textile industry.

The raw materials for papermaking were very tight a year or two ago. Recently, after efforts from all parties, this situation has also improved. Among the raw materials for papermaking, the amount of grass fiber used is increasing year by year. Recently, the trial production of printing paper and cardboard paper from sugarcane bagasse has been successful; the trial production of cement bag paper from cotton stalks has also yielded preliminary results. These achievements will reduce the use of wood and increase the production and supply of paper.

In some places, bricks are made from furnace ash and cement raw materials are made from furnace slag, and the quality is very good, which also solves the difficulty of urban disposal of furnace ash waste (furnace ash accounts for about 60% of the winter waste in Beijing).

Decentralized underground resources can be used to run more small and medium-sized factories and mines.

Comprehensive utilization of raw materials must be strived for in the future.

As for China's underground resources, they are also very rich. In addition to those concentrated resources with large reserves that need to be mined and processed in a focused manner, there are also many scattered resources, such as coal, iron, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, oil shale, as well as mica, asbestos, graphite, and other mineral deposits, which can be used to build small and medium-sized factories and mines according to the conditions to increase raw material production and enrich export sources. Other raw materials such as ceramics and glass industry are available in all provinces and regions, and can be gradually developed according to market needs.

There is also great potential in the comprehensive utilization of resources and improving the output rate. For example, 1 million tons of cottonseed, in addition to producing more than 150,000 tons of cottonseed oil, can produce 22,000 tons of byproduct shellac, 75,000 tons of short velvet, 4,000 tons of alcohol, 14,000 tons of soap, and 143 tons of glycerin; a sugar factory that processes 1,000 tons of sugar beets per day, in addition to producing 22,400 tons of white sugar per year, can also produce 1,600 tons of alcohol and 200,000 tons of feed, which can support 50,000 dairy cows. For example, if the oil extraction rate of the oil industry in 1958 is increased by an average of 1%, it is equivalent to increasing the production of edible oil by 70,000 tons; if the sugar extraction rate of native sugar is increased by an average of 1%, it is equivalent to increasing the production of sugar by 30,000 tons. All of these must be strived for in the future.

Small and medium-sized enterprises are the mainstay of decentralized construction.

Second, we must implement the policy of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises and decentralized construction.

The raw materials needed by local industry are scattered, and the sales market of products is also scattered. Therefore, local industry should focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, and should generally be decentralized and built in small and medium-sized towns, rural areas, and mountainous areas. There are many benefits to adopting this approach.

There are ten major benefits to adopting this approach

First, it can enable enterprises to make full use of local resources.

Second, it can enable enterprises to easily grasp market conditions, be flexible in production, and better adapt to social needs.

Third, because it is close to the raw material production area and the sales market, it can save transportation costs for raw materials and products.

Fourth, it is possible to solve the labor arrangement problem of seasonal production in factories. Factories can sign seasonal worker or temporary worker contracts with agricultural cooperatives to rationally allocate and use the labor force for industrial and agricultural production.

Fifth, it is possible for factories to support agricultural production in terms of power equipment and machinery repair. At the same time, according to the development of the local agricultural economy and rural needs, joint factories with diversified operations can be established, such as generating electricity, processing grain and rice, ginning cotton, and extracting oil. In this way, agriculture promotes the development of industry, animal husbandry, and other sideline occupations, and conversely, industry promotes the development of the rural and mountainous economy.

Sixth, it is possible to mobilize local and even agricultural cooperative manpower, material resources, and financial resources to establish local industries, reducing the state's investment in capital construction.

Seventh, it is possible to increase farmers' income, improve farmers' scientific and cultural level, and further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.

Eighth, it is possible to prevent the urban population from being too concentrated, reduce the supply burden of urban life needs, and reduce the state's investment in municipal construction.

Ninth, it is possible to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas.

Tenth, it is possible to make local industry leap forward comprehensively on a national scale.

Of course, this does not mean that local industry can only be small and medium-sized, and cannot be large-scale. Based on the experience of the First Five-Year Plan, in cases where resources are relatively concentrated and technical requirements are high, or because the comprehensive utilization of resources is not only technically feasible but also economically cost-effective, it is natural to consider building larger-scale enterprises. However, such large-scale enterprises are, after all, a minority on a national scale, and even a smaller minority for local industry.

We should ideologically recognize the correctness and necessity of this policy.

Some people have not yet figured out the policy that local industry should focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and decentralized construction. They have the following main concerns:

(1) They believe that "the investment in small factories is relatively greater than that in large factories." They assume that small factories are only a microcosm of large factories in terms of equipment, factory buildings, and welfare facilities. In fact, this is not the case. Small factories and large factories have not only quantitative differences, but also qualitative differences. For example, the pulping process of large paper mills requires high temperature and high pressure, which requires high-pressure boilers; while small paper mills can use ordinary pots or iron buckets for cooking, and some can also use lime soaking. Large factories use a lot of people and need a lot of dormitories and other living welfare facilities; small factories use fewer people, most of whom live locally, and fewer or no dormitories and welfare facilities can be built. Therefore, the unit construction investment of small factories is generally not greater than that of large factories, but smaller than that of large factories. For example, the construction of a sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,000 tons of sugar beets requires an investment of about 14 million yuan, and the construction cost per ton of sugar is 520 yuan; while the construction of a small sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 20 to 30 tons of sugar beets only requires an investment of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and the construction cost per ton of sugar is only about 150 yuan. Other industries have similar situations.

(2) They believe that "the management cost and product cost of small factories are relatively increased compared with large factories." This is also worth studying. For example, in terms of the number of people who are separated from production, some small factories and handicraft cooperatives can achieve less separation from production, semi-separation from production, and non-separation from production by administrative management personnel; while the management personnel of large factories who are separated from production are generally more than 20%, and even after the streamlining of personnel in some factories during this rectification movement, they are generally still around 10%. Other production costs also vary, and not everything is higher for small factories. To take a step back, even if the production cost of some small factories is higher than that of large factories, it is more beneficial to the country to engage in small factories from the perspective of utilizing resources, saving transportation costs and investment in transportation lines and equipment, and adapting products to market needs. Some small factories can also engage in diversified operations in different seasons, such as egg factories can process fruits, etc., and can reduce costs if they start work all year round; not to mention that small factories generally expand the utilization of resources and can also promote the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.

(3) They believe that "small factories are not as good as large factories in terms of comprehensive utilization of raw materials and product quality." It should be admitted that this situation does exist in some industries. However, in this case, it is still possible to implement the principle of combining large, medium, and small, and focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises. For example, the quality requirements for fiber degumming are relatively high, and it is possible to build parent-child factories that combine small factories and large factories. That is: semi-degumming is first carried out in small factories (child factories) or workshops, and then transported to large factories (parent factories) with better equipment for processing and utilization according to different uses that require full degumming. This not only reduces the amount of transportation (the volume is reduced after fiber is semi-degummed), but also reduces the degumming cost compared to the past when large and small factories are combined. As for those raw materials that need to be comprehensively utilized, they can also be initially processed in small factories. For example, sugarcane can be first squeezed by small pressing machines and then the sugarcane juice is sent to large factories for sugar refining. Some by-products can also be used by the small factories themselves. To take a step back, even if some small factories cannot use by-products, it is much better than not using completely dispersed resources. As for product quality, even if the equipment and technical conditions of small factories are relatively poor, it is not necessarily bad. For example, a small cannery affiliated to the Urban Service Department near Caishikou in Beijing has a scale of one ton per day, but now it only produces half a ton per day. The quality of the canned food produced has been tested and meets export standards. To take another step back, some small factories can gradually improve through efforts, even if the product quality is not good today.

It can be seen that the policy of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises and decentralized construction in towns and villages for local industry is precisely the implementation of the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results. The correctness and necessity of this policy are beyond doubt.

Of course, the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises should also pay full attention to solving some problems in resources, power, transportation, and production technology. At present, we should summarize the existing experiences of small and medium-sized enterprises by industry and propose some standard designs, even if they are preliminary, which will be very helpful for the development of local industry.

Fully exploit production potential

Third, we must fully exploit the existing production potential, strengthen enterprise management, improve production technology, increase product varieties, improve product quality, and regularly study social needs and improve business methods.

Existing local industrial enterprises, although small in scale, are numerous and have great potential. Sufficient attention should be paid to existing enterprises. In order to strive for a great leap forward in local industry, it is necessary to fully exploit the production potential of existing enterprises. Strengthening enterprise management is an important step in exploiting the potential of existing enterprises. In recent years, the management of local industrial enterprises has been greatly improved. However, most enterprises still have varying degrees of waste, and the production costs of many enterprises are still relatively high, and the labor productivity is still relatively low. Through the rectification movement, on the basis of improving mass awareness, relying on the masses, we must vigorously improve management, overcome waste, reduce costs, and improve labor productivity. Improving production technology is another important step in exploiting the potential of existing enterprises. Many local enterprises can greatly increase output, improve quality, and increase varieties with slight improvements in equipment, operation, or labor organization. It does not cost much money, and the results are fast and effective. Such examples can be found in every region. This practice of making the most of existing conditions, running factories diligently and thriftily, and fully exploiting potential should be greatly promoted.

Local industry should regularly study social needs, especially the needs of agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people. After the great leap forward in agricultural production, the manufacturing and repair tasks of agricultural power machinery, small water pumping machines, new agricultural implements, improved agricultural implements, small agricultural implements, insecticide machinery, and transportation tools have greatly increased. Agricultural power equipment should preferably be able to use various fuels such as firewood, grass, coal, and oil, and can be used for farming, weeding, harvesting, water pumping, and transportation. Some agricultural machinery can also consider using water power, animal power, human power, and wind power. All agricultural machinery should be lightweight, strong, durable, and inexpensive. This requires strengthening investigation and research and solving problems according to local conditions.

Market conditions are constantly changing, and local industrial production should pay attention to adapting to this change. At the same time, business methods should also pay attention to adapting to this change. Due to diligent and thrifty construction of the country and diligent and thrifty households, a new atmosphere has formed in urban and rural areas, group purchasing power has decreased, and residents' purchasing power has also changed somewhat. Therefore, industries such as furniture and sewing, which were once in short supply, have reduced their manufacturing tasks, while the demand for furniture repair and clothing alteration has increased. This requires these industries of local industry and handicraft cooperatives to promptly pay attention to adjusting unreasonable prices and solving shortcomings in business methods, so as to achieve the purpose of both adapting to social needs and increasing industrial production.

In the process of vigorous development of local industry, it is necessary to strengthen overall planning. The purpose of this overall planning is to promptly solve the new problems that constantly occur in development between raw material supply, industrial production, and product sales, so that various provinces, cities, and regions, within provinces, cities, and regions; between various industries, within various industries; between various years, and within various years can closely cooperate and form an organic link, so as to actively strive for balance on the basis of development, and promote higher development through balance. This mutual promotion and mutual assistance can more powerfully promote the new leap forward in local industry.

The key to a great leap forward in local industry lies in boosting energy and overcoming conservative ideas; we must do everything possible to tap the potential of raw materials, rather than "waiting for the rabbit to hit the tree"; we must consider the size of factories according to the circumstances, rather than blindly running large factories;

We must calculate carefully and strive for perfection, rather than wasting money and resources.

Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done to catch up with and exceed the total output value of agriculture by 1962. The primary key is to boost revolutionary enthusiasm and overcome conservative ideas. Experience has shown that when there were difficulties in industrial raw materials or sales, two attitudes have emerged. One is to do everything possible to tap the potential of raw materials and study social needs; the other is to adopt the method of "waiting for the rabbit to hit the tree" and waiting for raw materials and customers to come to the door. If the former method is adopted, production will develop very quickly. If the latter method is adopted, it will form an old cow pulling a broken cart. Experience has also proved that there are also two approaches to the construction scale of factories. One is to consider the size of the factory according to the raw material supply and sales situation, adapting to the needs; the other is to disregard the objective situation, only focusing on the internal affairs of the factory, and blindly building large factories. If the former method is adopted, local industry will develop faster; if the latter method is adopted, it will increase supply and marketing difficulties and national losses. Experience has also proved that there are also two different approaches to capital construction and business management. One is to calculate carefully, strive for perfection, spend less money, do more things, spend the same amount of money and do more things, and some things can be done without spending money; the other approach is to be wasteful, not counting carefully, and causing waste. The former approach plays a promoting role, while the latter approach plays a demoting role. There are differences between advanced and backward in all aspects of local industry. We must enable the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become more advanced. We must learn and absorb all the advanced experience that can be absorbed, mobilize all the positive factors that can be mobilized, and give full play to all the forces that can be brought into play (including human, material, and financial resources). We will continue to tirelessly tap the huge potential of local industry. Objective conditions are available. The key lies in recognizing the development situation, boosting revolutionary enthusiasm, riding the wind and waves, striving for the upstream, and resolutely fighting to strive to realize that local industry exceeds the total output value of agriculture in 1962!

### 争取1962年地方工业产值超过农业总产值  国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫的发言

专栏：

    争取1962年地方工业产值超过农业总产值
    国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫的发言
    我想就关于大力发展地方工业问题发表一些意见。
    最近两周，人民日报又连续发表了四篇振奋人心的消息，这就是陕西、甘肃、安徽、江西四省提出的：到一九六二年或稍多一点时间，地方工业的产值要争取超过农业总产值，这个豪迈的大跃进的奋斗目标的提出，无疑的具有全国的意义，它在指明全国地方工业随着农业生产高潮和工业建设高潮而必然要出现的一种新形势和新任务。
    地方工业的新形势和新任务
    第一个五年计划的实际情况指明：地方工业产值的增加，一方面在很大程度上要依靠农业生产的发展，另一方面，地方工业产值的增长速度又一定会大大地超过农业生产增长的速度，正是由于这点，全国地方工业产值和农业总产值的比例，大体上已经由一九五二年的一比二改变为一九五七年的一比一点五。在第二个五年计划期间，只要地方工业保持比农业加倍的发展速度，就可以使地方工业产值和农业总产值的比例由一比一点五进而达到一比一甚至前者超过后者。假定说：农业生产速度今后每年平均增长百分之七至十左右，那末，地方工业每年平均增长百分之十四至二十左右，就可以使地方工业产值赶上农业总产值了。因此，陕西、甘肃、安徽三省提出的要在一九六二年使地方工业产值赶上农业总产值是有客观根据的。
    去年各省地方工业产值和农业产值所占比例的情况说明，基础比较薄弱的陕西、安徽和甘肃能够做到在1962年使地方工业产值赶上农业总产值，全国大多数省份没有理由做不到
    一九五七年预计全国各省区地方工业产值在本省范围内占地方工业和农业总产值合计的比例，大体上是：地方工业产值占一半以上超过农业总产值的有一个省（辽宁），占不到一半但接近农业总产值的有三个省（江苏、浙江、吉林），占三分之一左右的有四个省（广东、黑龙江、山西、四川），占四分之一左右的有十一个省。而陕西、安徽和江西三省就是属于这一类，其余几省都在百分之十五至二十之间，甘肃省就是属于这一类。如果说，现在地方工业基础还比较薄弱的陕西、安徽和甘肃三省能够做到在一九六二年或稍多一点时间内使地方工业产值赶上农业总产值，那末，在全国大多数省区就没有理由做不到这点。
    地方工业和农业生产关系非常密切，因此，目前农业生产高潮和工业建设高潮汹涌澎湃的发展，必然要带动地方工业空前发展，对这种新情况估计不足，就要犯错误
    地方工业的绝大部分是农业产品加工的消费资料和为农业生产服务的生产资料，而全国消费资料百分之九十左右是由地方工业进行生产的，为农业生产服务的生产资料，也有相当大的部分是由地方工业进行生产的。目前这些产品的绝大部分又都是供不应求，客观上迫切要求大力加以发展。此外，地方工业还生产大量的出口物资，并且为配合大工业建设生产各种必不可少的协作产品。在这两个方面，今后的发展前途也是非常广阔的。由此可见，地方工业和农业生产及城乡人民生活密切结合，相依为命，它的发展，首先将取决于农业生产的发展，因为只有农业生产的发展才能供给地方工业以充分的原料和广阔的市场，反过来，地方工业的发展又是促进农业生产必不可缺少的条件，因为没有地方工业的发展就不能供给农业以必要的生产资料，就不能把大量的农产品加工成为工业品，供给社会需要。同时地方工业又是大工业建设必不可少的助手和供给外汇的重要源泉，因此，可以断定：目前农业生产高潮和工业建设高潮汹涌澎湃的向前发展，必然要带动地方工业的这些主要部分在第二个五年计划期间获得空前的发展。这就是在我们面前将要出现的一种新情况，这种新情况必然要代替第一个五年计划期间由于农产品原料供应不足而使地方工业特别是消费资料的生产潜力不能得到充分发挥的老情况。如果我们对这种新情况估计不足，我们的工作就要落在客观形势发展的后面，就不可避免的要犯保守主义的错误。
    争取地方工业大跃进有五个有利条件：地方工业有可能在农村遍地开花；各个省区发展虽不平衡，但在国家计划指导下将促成共同高涨；地方积极性将进一步发挥；职工生产热情将会空前高涨；各方面的大力支援。
    这里，在争取地方工业的大跃进中，还必须指出以下的有利条件：
    第一，我国社会主义制度的优越性和在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针的贯彻执行，将使得工业和农牧业紧密地互相结合起来，地方工业有可能在农村遍地开花。
    第二，我国的地方工业经过几年来的发展，一般说已经有了相当强大的基础。虽然在各个省区的发展是不平衡的。不平衡将在国家计划的指导下促成全国各省区共同的高涨。
    第三，国家的工业化，商业财政等管理体制的改进，必将进一步发挥地方积极性，从而更加有利于地方工业的发展。
    第四，地方工业的广大职工群众，有着勤劳勇敢、刻苦钻研的精神，特别是经过整风和大辩论之后，政治思想觉悟进一步提高，积极性和创造性会有更大的发挥，生产热情会有空前的高涨。
    第五，我国的地方工业在党的正确领导下将会得到各方面的大力支援。有了上述这些条件，全国大多数省区要在五年内或者稍多一点时间实现地方工业产值超过农业总产值这个伟大的理想，当然是有可能做到的。
    目前应该注意做好的几项工作
    为了在新的情况下大力发展地方工业，不消说需要做很多深入细致的艰苦工作，目前应该特别注意做好以下几项主要工作：
    充分发掘原料资源
    首先，要充分发掘原料资源的潜在力量。
    交通方便地区的原料已经或开始注意利用；山区野生的原料，很少或没有利用；有些利用的原料，也仅用其一部分，没有综合利用。这说明原料潜力很大
    几年来，地方工业尤其是轻工业生产，往往遇到原料不足的困难，影响工业发展速度。我们能不能克服原料困难，争取地方工业的大发展呢？我认为是可能的。因为目前原料的潜力还是很大的，从原料利用方面来说，大量集中的、交通便利地区的原料，已经利用或者开始注意利用；对于那些小量分散的、野生的、交通不便地区的原料，就很少利用或者根本没有利用；即使在已经利用的原料当中，也还有很多原料只用了一部分，对它们的副产品没有综合地加以利用。从原料生产方面来说，各种经济作物的单位面积产量，都在不断增加，质量也在逐步提高，在不影响和少影响粮食产量的条件下，还可以适当地扩大经济作物的种植面积；至于那些野生的、可以作为纤维、淀粉、脂肪等工业原料的物资，加以利用之后，也必然会促进它们的发展。
    用二千万亩盐碱低洼地种植向日葵全国每人平均增加食油一点七市斤
    以油料为例，过去几年来，由于油料不足，我国全国人口平均分得的食油量还是比较低的。目前农业部门正在积极规划，采取措施，力争提高单位面积产量，稳定油料作物的面积；还考虑在红壤、沙荒地区增种花生，在盐碱低洼地区种向日葵等油料，在山区增种木本油料。山西定襄县的部分农业合作社，在盐碱地上试种向日葵，每亩产量平均在二百五十斤左右，可以榨油六、七十斤，每亩地所产的向日葵盘子和向日葵油饼喂猪，可以超过每亩所产粮食的效益，加上榨油六、七十斤，就相当于相当面积种粮食收入的三倍以上。几年来的实践证明，向日葵具有耐碱、耐旱、耐涝的优点，全国有一万四千万亩低洼地，三万万亩以上的盐碱地，如果拿出二千万亩盐碱地和低洼地来种向日葵，平均每亩收二百斤，一年就可以增产植物油五十四万吨，等于全国每人平均增加食油一点七市斤。更不用说在路边、河边、村边和其他空隙地带都可以种向日葵、蓖麻籽等油料作物了。
    盐碱地种甜菜经济价值也很大  酿酒用野果可以节省大量粮食
    糖料作物的情况，大体也是如此，在盐碱地上种甜菜的经济效益和向日葵不相上下。每亩甜菜，除了用于制糖之外，仅就甜菜的梗叶废丝用来喂牲口，就可以顶得上一亩多高粱的产量。在南方的若干粮食低产地区和死角粮地区，可以种植甘蔗，每亩收益也和甜菜差不多。
    在酿酒工业方面，近来中央有关各部和地区在初步研究了野生果实之后，为酿酒原料开辟了一个广阔的途径，其中仅橡子一项，据说全国估计年产有八十亿斤左右，如果拿一半来酿酒，就可以出酒四十万吨左右，相当于九十多万吨玉米的出酒数量。
    甘蔗渣可能成为纺织造纸重要原料
    用炉灰制砖和炉渣制洋灰质量很好
    纺织工业的原料很不稳定，各地对棉花增产问题已经重视，对蚕茧、毛、麻的培育增产也正在积极规划。此外，各地正在积极研究利用野生纤维，以胡麻、罗布麻等脱胶后和棉花混纺；用棉杆皮和黄洋麻混纺麻袋，一九五八年计划利用的棉杆皮就可以多织一百多万条麻袋。长春应用化学研究所以甘蔗渣试制人造纤维的浆粕，已获得初步成就，看来甘蔗渣很有可能成为纺织工业的重要原料之一。
    造纸原料前一、二年还很紧张，最近经过各方面的努力之后，这种情况，也有所改善。在造纸原料中，草类纤维的用量是逐年上升的。最近，以甘蔗渣试制印刷纸和图板纸，已经成功；以棉杆皮试制水泥袋纸也有初步结果。这些成就，都将减少木材的用量，增加纸张的产量和供应量。
    有的地方，利用炉灰制砖、利用炉渣做洋灰原料质量很好，还解决了城市处理炉灰垃圾的困难（北京市的冬季垃圾中，炉灰占百分之六十左右）。
    分散的地下资源可以多办中小厂矿
    综合利用原料今后必须努力去作
    至于我国的地下资源，也是很丰富的。除了那些集中的、蕴藏量很大的资源需要有重点地采掘和加工外，还有很多分散的资源，如煤、铁、有色金属、稀有金属、油页岩以及云母、石棉、石墨等矿藏，可以根据条件兴办中小型的厂矿，增加原材料生产，充实出口货源。其他如陶瓷和玻璃工业的原料，各省、区都有，可以根据市场需要，逐步发展。
    在资源的综合利用和提高出品率方面的潜力也很大。例如一百万吨棉籽，除了出棉籽油十五万多吨以外，可以出副产?酫二万二千吨，短绒七万五千吨，酒精四千吨，肥皂一万四千吨，甘油一百四十三吨；日处理甜菜一千吨的糖厂，除了年产白砂糖二万二千四百吨以外，还可以生产酒精一千六百吨，饲料二十万吨，可以供养奶牛五万头。又如一九五八年油脂工业的出油率如果平均提高百分之一，那就等于增产食油七万吨；土糖的出糖率如果平均提高百分之一，那就等于增产食糖三万吨。所有这些，今后都要努力去做。
    中小为主分散建设
    其次，要贯彻执行以中小型为主、分散建设的方针。
    地方工业所需要的原料是分散的，而产品的销售市场也是分散的。因此，地方工业应当以中小型为主，并且一般地应当分散建设在中小城镇、农村和山区。采取这种做法，有很多好处。
    采取这种做法有十大好处
    首先，能够使得企业充分利用当地资源。
    第二，能够使得企业便于掌握市场情况，生产机动灵活，更好地适应社会需要。
    第三，因为靠近原料产地和销售市场，因此能够节省原料和产品的运输费用。
    第四，就有可能解决工厂季节性生产的劳动安排问题，工厂可以和农业合作社订季节工或者临时工的合同，合理调配和使用工业和农业生产的劳动力。
    第五，就有可能在动力设备和机械修配等方面工厂支援农业生产。同时，根据当地农业经济的发展和农村需要，可以兴办多种经营的联合工厂，例如既发电、又粮米加工、又轧花、又榨油。这样，农业促进了工业、牧业和其他副业的发展，反过来，工业又促进农村和山区经济的发展。
    第六，就有可能动员地方以至农业合作社的人力、物力和财力来兴办地方工业，减少国家基本建设的投资。
    第七，就有可能增加农民收入，提高农民的科学、文化水平，进一步加强工农联盟。
    第八，就有可能使得城市人口不至于过分集中，减少城市生活需要的供应负担，减少国家对于市政建设的投资。
    第九，就有可能缩小城市和乡村之间的差别。
    第十，就有可能使得地方工业在全国范围内，全面地大跃进。
    当然，这里并不是说地方工业就只能是中小型的，不能办大型的。根据第一个五年的经验，在资源相当集中和技术要求较高的情况下，或者由于资源的综合利用不仅在技术上可以办到，而且在经济上也是合算的情况下，自然也要考虑建设规模较大的企业。不过这样的大型企业就全国来说，毕竟是少数，就地方工业来说，更是少数。
    应该从思想上认识到这一方针的正确性和必要性
    有些人，对于地方工业应该以中小型为主和分散建设的方针，还没有在思想上搞通，他们有以下几点主要的疑虑：
      （一）他们认为：“小厂的投资要比大厂相对地增大”。他们设想小厂只不过是大厂在设备、厂房、福利设施等方面的缩影。实际上并不是这样。小厂和大厂不仅有着量的不同，还有着质的区别。例如，大型纸厂制浆过程需要高温高压，这就需要高压锅炉；而小型纸厂采取普通的锅或铁桶蒸煮就可以了，有的还可以采取石灰沤的办法。大厂用人多，需要很多宿舍等生活福利设施；小厂用人少，大都居住在本地，宿舍和福利设施等可以少建或者不建。因而小厂的单位建设投资一般不是比大厂大，而是比大厂小。例如，建设一个日处理甜菜一千吨的糖厂，大约需要投资一千四百万元，每吨糖的建设费用为五百二十元；而建设一个日处理二十至三十吨甜菜的小糖厂，只要投资七至八万元，每吨糖的建设费用大约只要一百五十元左右。其他行业也有类似情况。
      （二）他们认为：“小厂的管理费用和产品成本比大厂相对地增加”。这一点也值得研究。例如，以脱离生产的人数来说，有些小厂和手工业合作社可以做到行政管理人员少脱离生产、半脱离生产和不脱离生产；而大厂脱离生产的管理人员一般总是在百分之二十以上，经过这次整风运动有的工厂人员精简之后，一般也还在百分之十左右。其他生产成本也互有高低，并不是一切都是小厂的高。退一步说，即使有些小厂的生产成本比大厂高一些，但是从利用资源、节约运输费用和运输线路设备的投资，以及产品适应市场需要等方面考虑，搞小厂对国家更为有利。有些小厂，在不同的季节还可以进行多种经营，例如蛋厂可以进行水果加工等，常年开工，成本还可以降低；更不用说，小厂一般是扩大利用了资源，还可以促进农业和牧业的发展了。
      （三）他们认为：“小厂在综合利用原料和产品质量方面不如大厂”。应当承认，在若干行业确实存在着这种情况。但是，在这种情况下，也还是可以贯彻执行大中小相结合，并且以中小型为主的方针，例如纤维脱胶的质量要求较高，可以建设一些小厂和大厂相结合的子母工厂，这就是：先在小型厂（子厂）或作坊中进行半脱胶，根据不同的用途，需要全脱胶的再运到设备较好的大厂（母厂）去处理利用，这样不仅可以减少运输量（纤维半脱胶之后，体积减少），将大小厂合并计算，脱胶成本也比过去降低。至于那些需要综合利用的原料，也可以在小厂进行初步加工。例如甘蔗，先由小型榨机压榨后，再将蔗汁送大厂炼糖。有些副产品小厂本身也可以利用。退一步说，即使有些小厂不能利用副产品，也比较分散的资源完全不去利用要好得多。至于产品质量，即使小厂的设备和技术条件比较差一些，也不见得就一定不好。例如城市服务部所属的一个在北京菜市口附近的小型罐头厂，规模是日产一吨，现在只有日产半吨，生产的罐头，经过检验，质量合乎出口标准。再退一步说，有些小厂，即使今天产品质量不好，也还是可以经过努力，逐步改进的。
    由此可见，地方工业以中小型为主和分散建设于城镇农村的方针，正是贯彻执行又多、又快、又好、又省的勤俭建国的方针。这个方针的正确性和必要性，是不用再怀疑的了。
    当然，举办中小型企业，也应该充分注意解决资源、动力、运输以及生产工艺上的一些问题。目前，我们应当按行按业地很好地总结已有的中小型企业的经验，提出一些那怕是初步的标准设计来，这对于发展地方工业是很有帮助的。
    充分发挥生产潜力
    第三，要充分发挥现有的生产潜力，加强企业管理，改进生产技术，增加产品品种，提高产品质量，经常研究社会需要，改进经营方式。
    现有的地方工业企业，规模虽小，但数量众多，而且潜力很大。对现有的企业，应该予以足够的重视。为了争取地方工业的大跃进，必须充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力。加强企业管理，这是发挥现有企业潜力的一个重要步骤。这几年来，地方工业企业的管理工作，有了很大改进。但是，大多数企业，还存在着程度不同的浪费现象，不少企业的生产成本还比较高，劳动生产率还比较低。应该通过整风运动，在群众觉悟提高的基础上，依靠群众，狠狠地改进管理工作，克服浪费，降低成本、提高劳动生产率。改进生产技术，是发挥现有企业潜力的又一个重要步骤。许多地方企业往往在一些设备上、操作上或者劳动组织上，稍加改进，就能够大大提高产量、改进质量、增加品种，花钱不多，收效又大又快，这类事例，在各个地区都可找到。这种因陋就简、勤俭办厂、充分发挥潜力的做法，应该大大提倡。
    地方工业要经常研究社会需要，特别是农业生产和城乡人民生活的需要。农业生产大跃进之后，农业动力机械、小型抽水机器、新式农具、改良农具、小农具、杀虫药械以及交通工具的制造和修理任务大大增加。农业动力设备，最好是可以使用柴、草、煤、油等各种燃料，既能够用来耕田、锄草、收割，又能够用来抽水、运输。有些农业机械，还可以考虑用水力、畜力、人力和风力。所有的农业机械都应当是轻便、坚牢、耐用，价廉物美。这就要加强调查研究，因地制宜地加以解决。
    市场情况，经常变化，地方工业生产固然要注意适应这种变化，同时，经营方式也要注意适应这种变化。由于勤俭建国、勤俭持家，在城乡形成一种新的风气，集团购买力有所减少，居民购买力也起了一些变化，因此像家具、缝纫等行业，过去一度供不应求，现在制造任务有所减少，而家具修理和服装翻改的要求有所增加。这就要求地方工业和手工业合作社的这些行业，及时注意调整不合理的价格和解决经营方式上的缺点，使之达到既能够适应社会需要，又能够增加工业生产的目的。
    在地方工业蓬勃发展的过程中，必须加强统筹规划工作，这种统筹规划工作的目的是为了及时解决发展中在原料供应、工业生产和产
  品销售之间不断发生的新问题，使各省、市、区之间，省、市、区内部；各行业之间，各行业内部；各年度之间，各年度之内互相密切配合，并且结成有机的联系，以便在发展的基础上积极地争取平衡，通过平衡促进更高的发展，这样相互助长，相互促进，就能更有力地推动地方工业的新跃进。
    地方工业大跃进关键在于鼓足干劲，克服保守思想；要千方百计地挖掘原料潜力，而不是“守株待兔”；要根据情况考虑工厂大小，而不是盲目办大；
    要精打细算精益求精，而不是财大气粗造成浪费。
  当然，地方工业产值要在一九六二年赶上和超过农业总产值，需要做的工作还很多。首要的关键在于鼓足革命干劲，克服保守思想。经验证明：工业原料或销路发生困难的时候，曾经出现过两种态度，一种是千方百计地挖掘原料潜力，研究社会需要；另一种是采取“守株待兔”的办法，等待原料和顾客上门。采取前一种办法，生产就发展得很快，采取后一种办法就形成老牛拖破车。经验也证明：在工厂的建设规模上，也有两种做法：一种是根据原料供应和销售情况，考虑工厂规模的大小，随弯就圆，适应需要；另一种是不顾客观情况，只从工厂内部着眼，盲目地办大厂。采取前一种办法，使地方工业发展得较快；采取后一种办法，就增加供销困难和国家损失。经验还证明：在基本建设和经营管理方面也存在着两种不同的做法，一种是精打细算，精益求精，少花钱，多办事，花同样多的钱，办更多的事，有些事不花钱也能办；另一种做法是财大气粗，不算细账，造成浪费。前一种做法，是起着促进的作用，后一种做法则起着促退的作用。在地方工业的各个方面，都存在着先进和落后的差别，必须使落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进，学习和吸取一切可以吸取的先进经验，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，发挥一切可以发挥的力量（包括人力、物力和财力），继续不懈地挖掘地方工业的巨大潜力。客观条件是具备的，关键在于我们认清发展形势，鼓足革命干劲，乘风破浪，力争上游，坚决地为争取实现地方工业在一九六二年超过农业总产值而奋斗！
