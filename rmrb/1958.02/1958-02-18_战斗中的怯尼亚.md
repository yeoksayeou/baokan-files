	Kenya in Battle

	Traveling southwest from Somalia, on the northeastern corner of Africa, one arrives at Kenya, a British colony located on the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa. To realize their legitimate rights, the Kenyan people’s national liberation armed struggle has been ongoing for more than five years. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's resolution on imperialism stated: "The Kenyan people have the right to self-determination and to recover their forcibly occupied lands."

	Kenya is a tropical country straddling the equator. It has an area of ​​more than 582,000 square kilometers, which is slightly less than two and a half times that of the United Kingdom. The population is approximately 6.15 million, of which 97% are Black Africans. The capital is called Nairobi. The name Kenya comes from the towering Mount Kenya within its borders, meaning "white mountain."

	Since ancient times, the Kenyan people have lived and worked peacefully on their own land. Chinese ceramics from the 14th to 17th centuries were discovered in Kenya the year before last, which shows that commerce in Kenya was very active in ancient times. British imperialism began to invade Kenya in the early 19th century, and it and the German colonizers who followed engaged in fierce competition in East Africa. In 1890, Britain and Germany signed a treaty dividing the spoils, with Britain acquiring Kenya and Uganda. In 1895, Britain declared Kenya a "East African Protectorate," and in 1920 it was renamed the "Colony and Protectorate of Kenya." Britain demarcated the narrow coastal area of ​​the central and southern regions as a "protectorate," and the rest of the area as a directly administered British colony. There was essentially no difference between the two parts, both of which were colonies under the rule of the British Governor.

	Due to the British imperialists' cruel plunder and exploitation, Kenya is still an extremely backward agricultural country. The main agricultural products include sisal hemp, coffee, tea, wheat, corn, cotton, peanuts, and leather. Almost all of these are monopolized by British colonizers as export commodities, and the Kenyans' own grain is insufficient to feed themselves. Kenya's already mined minerals such as alkali, salt, gold, and kyanite are also monopolized by British capital. American oil capital has also infiltrated northern Kenya after the war, obtaining exploration and exploitation rights.

	At the same time, Britain also uses Kenya as an important strategic base for controlling the Indian Ocean and suppressing the people of East Africa. Mombasa, Kenya's largest port, was a British military base during World War II. After the war, Britain continued to carry out military construction in Kenya for a long time. Since Britain's invasion of Egypt was defeated and Cyprus's value as Britain's main strategic base in the Middle East has been greatly reduced, British colonizers are reorganizing their Middle East strategic deployment. According to a report in the British "Times" on November 8 last year, Britain will establish an East African Command in Kenya as a strategic reserve force for its entire Middle East invading force.

	The land issue is the most important issue in the lives of the Kenyan people. The northern zone, which accounts for three-fifths of Kenya, is a semi-desert area, and more than 85% of the country's population and good farmland are concentrated on the coastal plains and southwestern highlands. However, British colonizers have seized all the good farmland in this area by force, driving the native blacks to arid "reserves." As a result, more than 5.8 million Kenyan Africans are forced to live on only 135,000 square kilometers of barren land in their own country, while more than 40,000 white immigrants occupy half of the country's fertile arable land. They actually cultivate only one-tenth of these lands. Africans who are driven to the "reserves" and cannot make a living have to go to the colonizers' plantations or flock to the cities and are forced to sell cheap labor.

	For more than sixty years, the Kenyan people have never succumbed to the cruel colonial rule. They have persisted in fighting for national independence and the recovery of their plundered land. The largest Kikuyu tribe, which accounts for one-fifth of Kenya's population, has played a significant role in the struggle. They organized the East African Association and the Kikuyu Central Association very early on, guiding the Kenyan people to fight. The scale of the Kenyan people's struggle has become larger and larger with the development of the entire African national liberation movement after World War II. After the war, the "African Union," which expressed the democratic aspirations of the Kenyan people, was organized. By 1952, 100,000 people had joined the Union. Workers in the capital Nairobi and Mombasa held strikes in 1944, 1947, 1950, and 1955 respectively. A large-scale Kenyan peasant movement also broke out in 1952. The excited Kenyan people destroyed the crops and livestock on the British people's estates and farms. The British colonial authorities were extremely panicked and declared a "state of emergency" in Kenya on October 20, 1952. The entire country was placed under martial law, and more than 30,000 soldiers and police equipped with modern weapons were mobilized to launch a frenzied attack on the Kenyan people, prohibiting all progressive organizations of the Kenyan people from engaging in activities, arresting "African Union" leader Kenyatta, and carrying out massacres and imprisonments of the Kenyan people. In the three years after the declaration of the "state of emergency," more than 90,000 Kenyans died in military operations, died tragically in prison, and starved to death due to exile.

	In the face of the British colonizers' armed attack, the Kenyan people organized their own armed forces and resisted stubbornly. For many years, there has been a patriotic armed organization with religious overtones called "Mau Mau" among the Kikuyu people. They rose up and resisted the British colonial army unyieldingly. The slogan of the "Mau Mau" struggle is: "Take back the land stolen by the white people." They established effective military and administrative organizations in the jungle, established their own government and parliament, and had a sound conscription, taxation system, and supply system, as well as their own courts and news agencies.

	For five years, the Kenyan people's armed resistance to the British imperialist guerrilla warfare has not only consumed a large amount of British manpower and material resources (in the first two and a half years alone, Britain's direct consumption reached approximately 75 million US dollars), but also seriously threatened British colonial rule in East Africa, making it impossible for Britain's colonial plan to merge Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika into an East African Federation to be realized.

    战斗中的怯尼亚
    从非洲东北角的索马里兰西南行，便到达位于东非印度洋岸的英国殖民统治下的怯尼亚。为了实现他们的正当权利，怯尼亚人民的民族解放武装斗争，已经进行五年多了。亚非人民团结大会关于帝国主义的决议中写道：“怯尼亚人民有权实行自决和收复他们被强占的土地”。
    怯尼亚是横跨赤道的热带之国。它的面积有五十八万二千余平方公里，相当于英国的两倍半弱。人口约六百一十五万，其中97％是非洲黑人。首都叫内罗毕。怯尼亚的国名来自境内的高耸的怯尼亚山，它的意思是“白色的山”。
    从古代以来，怯尼亚人民在自己的土地上和平劳动和生活着。前年在怯尼亚发现了十四到十七世纪的中国陶瓷，这说明在古代怯尼亚的商业就很活跃。英帝国主义在十九世纪初叶开始侵入怯尼亚，它和接踵而来的德国殖民者在东非展开激烈争夺。1890年，英德签订分赃条约，英国获有怯尼亚和乌干达。1895年英国宣布怯尼亚为“东非保护国”，1920年又改称为“怯尼亚殖民地和保护国”。英国把中南部沿海狭长地区划作“保护国”，其余地区划为英国的直属殖民地，这两部分实质上没有区别，都是在英国总督统治下的殖民地。
    由于英帝国主义的残酷掠夺和剥削，怯尼亚至今是一个极端落后的农业国，主要农产品有西沙尔麻、咖啡、茶、小麦、玉蜀黍、棉花、花生及皮革等。它们几乎全部作为出口商品被英国殖民者垄断，怯尼亚人自己的粮食却不足自给。怯尼亚已经开采的碱、盐、黄金和蓝晶石等矿产同样被英国资本所垄断。美国石油资本战后也渗入了怯尼亚的北部，取得勘探和开采的权利。
    英国同时还把怯尼亚当作控制印度洋和镇压东非人民的重要战略基地。怯尼亚最大的港口蒙巴萨在第二次大战时就是英国军事基地，战后英国又长期在怯尼亚进行军事建设。自从英国侵略埃及遭到失败，而塞浦路斯作为英国中东的主要战略基地的价值已经大大减弱以后，英国殖民者正在重新改组它的中东战略部署。据英国“泰晤士报”去年11月8日报道，英国将在怯尼亚建立东非司令部，作为它整个中东侵略部队的战略后备部队。
    土地问题是怯尼亚人民生活中最重要的问题。占怯尼亚五分之三的北部地带是半沙漠区，全国85％以上的人口和良田集中在沿海平原和西南部高地。而英国殖民者却将这一带良田用武力全部攫为己有，把土著黑人驱逐到干旱的“居留地”去，结果，使五百八十万以上的怯尼亚非洲人在自己的国土上被迫居住在面积只有十三万五千平方公里的贫瘠地区，四万多白种移民却霸占着全国半数肥沃的耕地，而他们实际耕种的不过是这些耕地的十分之一，被赶到“居留地”的无以为生的非洲人不得不到殖民者的种植园或拥向城市被迫出卖廉价的劳动力。
    六十多年来，怯尼亚人民从来没有向残酷的殖民统治屈服，他们坚持为民族独立和收回被劫夺的土地而斗争。在斗争中起显著作用的是占怯尼亚人口五分之一的最大的吉库犹部族，他们很早就组织过东非人协会和吉库犹中央协会，引导怯尼亚人民进行斗争。怯尼亚人民斗争的规模随着二次大战后整个非洲民族解放运动的发展愈来愈大。战后，表达怯尼亚人民民主愿望的“非洲人联盟”组织起来了，到1952年，有十万人参加了这个联盟。首都内罗毕和蒙巴萨的工人在1944年、1947年、1950年、1955年分别举行了罢工。大规模的怯尼亚农民运动也在1952年爆发了，激奋的怯尼亚人民破坏了英国人的庄园和农场的作物和牲畜。英国殖民当局异常惊慌，1952年10月20日宣布怯尼亚进入“紧急状态”，全国戒严，并调集了三万多名配备有新式武器的军警，对怯尼亚人民展开疯狂进攻，禁止怯尼亚人民的一切进步组织活动，逮捕了“非洲人联盟”领袖肯雅塔，大举屠杀和监禁怯尼亚人民。在宣布“紧急状态”的三年中，死在军事行动中的加上惨死狱中以及因放逐而饿死的怯尼亚人共有九万多人。
    在英国殖民者的武装进攻面前，怯尼亚人民组织起自己的武装部队顽强的抵抗着。多年来，吉库犹族中存在着名叫“茅—茅”的带有宗教色彩的爱国武装组织，他们奋起不屈地抵抗着英国殖民军，“茅—茅”的斗争口号是：“把白种人偷去的土地夺回来”。他们在丛林中建立了有效的军事和行政组织，成立了自己的政府和议会，有完善的征兵、税收制度和供应系统，还有自己的法庭和新闻机构。
    五年来，怯尼亚的人民武装抵抗英帝国主义的游击战争不仅消耗了英国大量的人力和物力（仅在头两年半的时期内，英国的直接消耗就达七千五百万美元左右），而且严重地威胁着英国在东非的殖民统治，使英国企图把怯尼亚、乌干达和坦噶尼喀三地合并为东非联邦的殖民计划一直无法实现。　（新华社）
