　　Reported by Shanxi Daily: A wave of comparing to the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is sweeping across industrial and transportation enterprises in Taiyuan City, with enterprises seeking advanced indicators and individuals seeking advanced rivals.

　　In order to quickly leave the technical and economic indicators of the United Kingdom behind, some factories compared their quality with the famous British products when setting their leap forward plans; some construction units compared their speed with the United Kingdom. Before liberation, the glass tubes and water level gauges on boilers were monopolized by British and American products in the Chinese market for decades. However, in recent years, the products of Taiyuan Zhongyuan Glass Factory have been sold to more than 20 provinces and cities across the country, and water level gauges have also been exported abroad. After the Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with the United Kingdom in steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years, the factory's employees dissected and analyzed the British famous brand "Vishaw Pura" glass tube and found that the heat resistance and appearance of their own products exceeded "Vishaw Pura," but the corrosion resistance and other aspects were not as good. The employees proposed to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and East Germany to make product quality surpass the United Kingdom within five years. Shanxi Chemical Plant learned that the quality of West German lithopone was higher than that of the United Kingdom, and the employees proposed to catch up with the quality indicators of West Germany and surpass the United Kingdom this year. In January, they had already increased the quality of lithopone from 76% to 82%. The initial rolling mill workshop under construction in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was originally planned to be put into production in the first quarter of 1959, but now it will be advanced to October this year, with the entire construction period shortened to fourteen months. The fastest construction speed for a workshop of this scale in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States is sixteen to eighteen months. Similar situations also occurred in Xing'an Chemical Materials Factory, Lianjin Electric Appliance Repair Factory, and other units.

　　Comparing indicators, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced with similar enterprises across the country has become a mass movement in the city's industrial and transportation departments. After discussing the advanced indicators of fraternal enterprises, the employees of each unit were stirred up with unparalleled revolutionary drive and regarded catching up with and surpassing advanced indicators as the most glorious task. The employees of Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant want to further reduce the coal consumption indicator by 1.5% compared with the state plan this year, reaching 0.515 kilograms of coal consumed per kilowatt-hour, catching up with Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant. The employees of Xishan Coal Mine want to make this year's daily output level catch up with Fengfeng Coal Mine, and the full-member efficiency indicators catch up with Datong Coal Mine.

　　When comparing indicators, the advanced technical and economic indicators of fraternal enterprises became the most powerful weapon against complacency and conservatism. Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has made great progress in the past year or so, and some cadres and workers have developed a sense of complacency, believing that other factories are not as good as their own. After the leaders printed and distributed the various indicators of fraternal factories across the country to the employees, the employees were greatly shocked in their thinking, generally shed the ideological baggage of complacency, and unanimously expressed that they would make the vehicle in-factory days indicator catch up with Mudanjiang and Shijiazhuang two vehicle repair factories this year. Many cadres in Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory have always believed that their unit is very advanced, cannot see the advanced aspects of fraternal enterprises, and cannot see the potential of their own factory. Recently, when comparing indicators, they found that the average processing product of each machine tool in Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory reached 36.8 tons in 1956, while their own factory only reached 22 tons last year, which greatly surprised cadres and workers at all levels. They immediately took action to tap potential in many ways and will catch up with Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory this year.

　　With the development of the high tide of comparing to the advanced and catching up with the advanced, a wave of popularizing advanced experience and technological innovation, and a wave of competition between people, also appeared in the high tide, and became a huge force driving the high tide forward. The employees of Lianjin Electric Appliance Repair Factory implemented innovations in four types of technical equipment, which not only increased production efficiency by six to twenty-one times respectively, but also reduced the volume of transformers and increased the insulation strength by three times. In order to realize the leap forward in production, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory established an advanced experience promotion leading group headed by the party committee secretary and the factory director, and is vigorously promoting the basic experience of Huanggu Village and Shijiazhuang two vehicle repair factories. Now, the competition between people organized by this factory through technical performances has been deeply developed, and many workers in the mechanical workshop have completed more than twelve hours of labor quota every day in eight hours. After the paint group of Taiyuan Railway Passenger Car Section sent people to Tianjin and Changxindian to learn advanced experience, they immediately changed their working methods and completed the January plan eight days ahead of schedule. Now, the atmosphere of mutual visits and learning between enterprises is higher than ever. In order to realize the leap forward plan, Taiyuan Public Transport Company will send people to Tianjin Public Transport Company to learn advanced experience.

　　At the recent meeting of party committee secretaries of industrial and transportation enterprises held by the CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee, it was requested that all units further carry out the work of comparing to the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. This wave will further develop forward.

### 比指标甩掉自满包袱　比先进鼓足革命干劲  太原工矿企业赶先进浪潮汹涌澎湃

　　比指标甩掉自满包袱　比先进鼓足革命干劲
    太原工矿企业赶先进浪潮汹涌澎湃
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：企业找先进指标，个人觅先进对手，比先进、学先进、赶先进的浪潮，漫卷着太原市工业和交通企业。
    为了把英国的技术经济指标很快地抛在后面，一些工厂在订跃进计划的时候，和英国的名牌产品比质量；一些建设单位和英国比速度。锅炉上的玻璃管和水面计，在全国解放前，英美产品垄断了我国市场达几十年，而最近几年来，太原中元玻璃厂的产品销售到全国二十多个省市，水面计还远销国外。党中央提出十五年赶上英国钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量的号召以后，这个厂的职工解剖并分析了英国的名牌货“维肖浦”玻璃管，发现本厂产品的耐热和外观都超过“维肖浦”，但在耐腐蚀性等方面还不及“维肖浦”，职工们提出要认真学习苏联和民主德国的先进经验，使产品质量在五年内超过英国。山西化学厂了解到西德的立德粉的质量比英国高，职工们提出在今年赶上西德的质量指标而超过英国，他们在1月份已经把立德粉的质量由76％提高到82％。太原钢铁厂正在施工的初轧车间，原来计划在1959年第一季度投入生产，现在要提前到今年10月份，全部施工期限缩短为十四个月，而这样规模的车间，在英美等国最快的施工速度是十六到十八个月。类似上述的情况，还发生在兴安化学材料厂、联进电器修造厂等单位。
    和全国同类型企业比指标、学先进、赶先进，在全市工业、交通部门已经成为群众性运动。各单位职工讨论了兄弟企业的先进指标以后，激起了无比的革命干劲，都把赶上和超越先进指标看成是最光荣的任务。太原第一发电厂职工，要把今年煤耗指标比国家计划再降低1.5％，达到每发一度电耗煤零点五一五斤，赶上上海杨树浦发电厂。西山煤矿职工，要使今年的日产量水平赶上峰峰煤矿，全员效率指标赶上大同煤矿。
    在对比指标的时候，兄弟企业先进的技术经济指标，成为反对自满保守思想最有力的武器。太原机车车辆修理厂一年多来进步很大，有些干部和工人产生了自满情绪，认为别的厂不如本单位；领导人员把全国兄弟厂的各项指标印发到职工中以后，职工们思想上大为震动，普遍甩掉自满的思想包袱，一致表示要使车辆在厂日数指标，今年赶上牡丹江和石家庄两个车辆修理厂。太原矿山机器厂有不少干部，一直认为本单位很先进，看不见兄弟企业先进之处，看不见本厂的潜力；最近在对比指标的时候，发现上海矿山机器厂的每台机床，1956年平均加工产品达三十六点八吨，而本厂去年才达二十二吨，使各级干部和工人大吃一惊，立即行动起来从多方面挖潜力，要在今年赶上上海矿山机器厂。
    随着比先进、赶先进高潮的发展，一个推广先进经验和革新技术的浪头，和一个人与人之间比赛的浪头，也出现于高潮之中，并成为推动高潮前进的巨大力量。联进电器修造厂职工，在四种技术设备上实行了革新，不仅使生产效率分别提高六倍至二十一倍，还缩小了变压器体积，使绝缘强度提高三倍。太原机车车辆修理厂为了实现生产跃进，成立了由党委书记和厂长挂帅的推广先进经验指导组，正在大力推行皇姑屯和石家庄两个车辆修理厂的基本经验。现在，这个厂通过组织技术表演掀起的人与人之间的比赛已经深入展开，机械车间许多工人每天八小时都完成了十二小时以上的劳动定额。太原铁路客车段油漆小组，派人到天津和长辛店学习先进经验回来以后，立即改变了工作方法，提前八天完成了1月份计划。现在，企业之间互相访问和学习的空气，比任何时候都高涨。太原市公共汽车公司为了实现跃进计划，将派人到天津市公共汽车公司学习先进经验。
    中共太原市委在最近召开的工业、交通企业党委书记会议上，要求各单位进一步开展比先进、学先进、赶先进的工作。这个浪潮将进一步向前发展。
