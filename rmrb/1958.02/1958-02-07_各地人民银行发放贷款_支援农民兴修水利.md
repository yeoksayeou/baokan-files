　　People's Banks in Various Regions Issue Loans
    to Support Farmers in Building Water Conservancy Projects

    This newspaper reports (text): As various regions vigorously undertake water conservancy projects based on the principle of diligence and thrift, People's Banks have promptly issued water conservancy loans, providing necessary support to many agricultural cooperatives. Jiangxi Province has allocated 8 million yuan from recovered agricultural loans as water conservancy loans. Hubei Province has allocated 9 million yuan from its agricultural loan quota and distributed it to various counties to support agricultural cooperatives in water conservancy construction. Henan Province, from November to December 20th last year, a period of fifty days, issued a total of 1.7 million yuan in water conservancy loans. Nanyang Special District in this province, from December 1st to 20th last year, issued a total of 240,000 yuan in water conservancy loans, helping 1,019 agricultural cooperatives purchase 523 waterwheels, dig and repair 7,102 wells, construct 759 ditches, canals, dams, and ponds, and purchase 6,468 various water conservancy tools.
    The loans issued this time are generally used in the areas where agricultural cooperatives need them most. According to a survey of four agricultural cooperatives in Majian and Xinbai townships in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, 201 small-scale water conservancy projects have been built, benefiting 8,300 mu of farmland, with a total engineering cost of 19,650 yuan, averaging only 97 yuan per project and 2.37 yuan per mu. Of the total engineering cost, agricultural cooperatives raised 16,050 yuan themselves, the state invested 500 yuan, and the bank loaned 3,100 yuan. In Hengnan County, Hunan, the original allocation of water conservancy loans was 120,000 yuan, and now 152 reservoirs and more than 10,000 ponds and dams have been built. Most of the required funds were resolved by the agricultural cooperatives themselves, with only a portion of the funds borrowed from the bank. Based on the current situation, the county's water conservancy loans will not be used up, so 10,000 yuan has been transferred to support other areas.

### 各地人民银行发放贷款  支援农民兴修水利

　　各地人民银行发放贷款
    支援农民兴修水利
    本报讯　当各地按照勤俭办水利的原则大兴水利的时候，人民银行及时发放水利贷款，给了许多农业社以必要的支持。江西省已从收回的农贷中拨出八百万元作为水利贷款。湖北省从农贷指标划出九百万元，分配到各县支援农业社进行水利建设。河南省在去年11月到12月20日的五十天中，共放出水利贷款一百七十万元，这个省的南阳专区在去年12月1日到20日共放出水利贷款二十四万元，帮助一千零一十九个农业社购买水车五百二十三部，打井和修井七千一百零二眼，修建沟、渠、坝、塘等工程七百五十九处，购买各种水利工具六千四百六十八件。
    这次发放的贷款一般都是用在农业社最需要的地方去。根椐浙江省兰溪县马涧、新柏等乡四个农业社的调查，已经兴建小型水利二百零一处，受益田八千三百亩，花用工程费用一万九千六百五十元，平均每处仅九十七元，每亩二元三角七分。工程费用总数中，农业社自筹资金一万六千零五十元，国家投资五百元，银行贷款三千一百元。湖南衡南县原来分配水利贷款十二万元，现在已建成水库一百五十二座，塘坝一万多处，所需费用，大部分是依靠农业社自己解决的，只向银行贷了一部分款。根据现在的情况看，这个县的水利贷款用不完，因此抽调一万元支持其他地区。
