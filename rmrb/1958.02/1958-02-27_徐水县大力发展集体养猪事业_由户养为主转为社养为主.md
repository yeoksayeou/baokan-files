Editor's Note: Xushui County's approach of focusing on collective pig raising and vigorously developing the collective pig-raising business is a bold and revolutionary measure in the current new situation of the agricultural leap forward. We believe that any region with certain conditions, after mass debate and with the consent of the masses, can and should adopt this approach to actively guide the pig-raising business from household raising to collective raising (as for the proportion of collective and household raising, it can vary from place to place) to strengthen the foundation of the collective economy and consolidate the cooperative ownership system.

Of course, this does not mean that household pig raising is no longer important in the future. The state will still guarantee appropriate income for pig-raising households, and agricultural cooperatives must continue to help pig-raising households raise pigs well to support agricultural production and national construction.

This newspaper reports: (By our reporter Zhang Chao) Vigorously developing the collective pig-raising business, with collective raising as the main focus and household raising as a supplement, has become an important policy in Xushui County, Hebei Province, for this year's great leap forward. To date, the number of pigs in the county has surged from 37,000 last year to 320,000 (an average increase from half a pig per household to five pigs per household). The 259 agricultural cooperatives have established more than 1,700 collective pig farms and more than 13,000 collective pigsties. Among them, 96 cooperatives have collective pig raising accounting for more than 50% of the total pig raising in each cooperative, with Dasigezhuang Pubu River Second Cooperative reaching 70%. The Xushui County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided that by autumn, the entire county should reach the standard of Pubu River Second Cooperative, that is, collective pig raising accounting for two-thirds (70%) and household pig raising accounting for one-third (30%); and it stipulates that each household should not raise more than two pigs in the future.

In order to ensure that the county's per-mu yield reaches 500 jin, the county committee put forward a slogan: "10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu." However, more than half of the fertilizer needs to be solved by raising pigs. The original 37,000 pigs were far from meeting the needs of this year's agricultural leap forward. The county committee put forward another slogan: "Raise one more pig, accumulate ten more carts of fertilizer, and harvest 200 more jin of grain." And through visiting pig farms, professional conferences, and other various meetings, carefully calculating accounts, explaining the reasons, and elucidating the benefits of pig raising for individuals, cooperatives, and the country, the vast number of members gritted their teeth and invested more than 2 million yuan in a short period of time (including investment in materials). The county committee then organized more than 160 cadres to go to Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Hubei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and other provinces to buy 280,000 fine piglets and some sows. By the end of the year, the number will increase to more than 500,000.

The great leap forward in pig raising has created two new problems: First, the original proportion of collective and household raising is no longer suitable for the new situation. If household raising continues to be the main focus, for example, 80% is for household raising, calculating based on more than 60,000 households in the county, each household would have to raise an average of four pigs, and by the end of the year, it would reach about seven pigs per household, which would inevitably occupy the labor force of the members and increase the cooperative's manure and fertilizer reward expenses; more seriously, because pig raising is profitable, it will inevitably promote the capitalist tendencies of the members and damage the interests of the collective economy. In order to avoid this situation, the county committee actively guided the agricultural cooperatives to shift from household raising to a combination of collective and household raising, and then to collective raising as the main focus. Pig-raising households will still be given appropriate rewards and assistance.

In order to ensure that agricultural cooperatives raise a large number of pigs well, the county committee firmly grasped two main links:

First, mobilize the masses to overcome the difficulty of feed. The masses said, "Pigs eat all kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find it or not." The county committee organized a group of cadres to learn pig-raising experience in Anguo and other counties, and then sent more than 30 cadres to pilot feed processing stations in eight cooperatives. Each township formed a five-person feed processing guidance group headed by the deputy secretary of the township party committee in charge of pig raising, and each production team formed a five to seven-member feed collection and processing professional group of women and male semi-laborers. The pilot results found that more than 120 kinds of plant stems and leaves can be used as roughage after processing. Then, an exhibition was held and promoted throughout the county. Now, every cooperative has a feed processing station, and the county can process 240 million jin annually. When green feed (alfalfa, sweet potatoes, etc.) is on the market, there will be more than enough feed.

Second, carry out epidemic prevention and health care work. If agricultural cooperatives concentrate a large number of pigs, an epidemic will spread instantly, which is a serious test of the policy of collective raising as the main focus. The county committee first concentrated more than 800 middle and primary school graduates and cooperative cadres, trained an epidemic prevention and health care team. Now every cooperative has a livestock guidance unit and a livestock clinic. There is one "pig doctor" for every 1,000 pigs and one "health worker" for every 500 pigs. 80% of the pigsties have established a regular disinfection system, wiping the pens with lime once every half month and washing the troughs with hot salt water every three to five days. Shady pens have been changed to sunny pens, some pigsties have been changed to cellars, some have added small pens inside, many pigsties have also hung grass curtains and heated them inside the pigsties, so that the piglets can spend the winter comfortably. Some members also put the little guests from the south in their homes and take them to the warm kang to spend the winter. Spring is coming, which is the season for pig epidemics. The county committee issued a notice as early as the end of January, stipulating that the first ten days of February will be a concentrated epidemic prevention period, and launched a competition for disease-free pig townships, disease-free pig cooperatives, and disease-free pig teams.

For Xushui County, developing pig-raising with collective raising as the main focus is completely unfamiliar, and the time and tasks are very tight. Therefore, in the initial period, the county committee invested two secretaries to lead the work personally. One secretary presided over the purchase of piglets, the collection of feed, the establishment of pig farms, and the training of cadres, and went deep into a township to conduct pilot projects; one secretary presided over the visit to pig farms, professional meetings, and mobilization reports, reporting every week. In just three months, a livestock production front focusing on pig raising was established from the county to the cooperative. Each township had a deputy secretary of the township branch, and each cooperative had a director who was responsible for this work, and it was decided to establish a livestock company managed by the Commercial Bureau to manage pig raising and other livestock production.

    徐水县大力发展集体养猪事业
    由户养为主转为社养为主
    编者按：徐水县采取社养为主、大力发展集体养猪事业的作法，在目前农业大跃进的新形势下，是一项大胆的革命措施。我们认为：凡是具备了一定条件的地区，经过群众辩论，征得群众同意，都可以而且应当采取这个作法，积极地把养猪事业由户养为主引导到社养为主（至于社养和户养各占多大比例，可以因地制宜），以增强集体经济的基础，巩固合作社所有制。
    当然，这并不是说今后户养猪不重要了，国家仍将保障养猪户有适当的收益，农业社仍须继续帮助养猪户把猪养好，来支援农业生产和国家建设。
    本报讯　本报记者张潮报道：大力发展集体养猪事业，以社养为主、户养为辅，已经成为河北省徐水县今年大跃进中一项重要的方针。到目前为止，全县生猪由去年的三万七千头激增到三十二万头（平均每户由半头上升到五头）。二百五十九个农业社，已经建立了一千七百多个集体养猪场，一万三千多个集体猪圈。其中有九十六个社的社养猪已占各社养猪总数的50％以上，大寺各庄瀑河二社已达到70％。中共徐水县委最近决定：在秋季以前，全县达到瀑河二社的标准，即社养猪占三分之二（70％），户养猪占三分之一（30％）；并且规定以后户养猪每户不超过两头。
    为了保证全县亩产量达到五百斤，县委提出一个口号：“每亩万斤肥”。但是，一半以上的肥料要靠养猪来解决。原有的三万七千头猪，远不能满足今年农业大跃进的需要，县委又提出一个口号：“多养一头猪，多积十车肥，多打二百斤粮。”并且通过参观养猪，专业会议和其他各种会议，算细账，讲道理，阐明养猪对个人、社和国家的好处，广大社员咬紧牙关，短时间内投资二百多万元（包括投料）。县委随即组织一百六十多名干部，分头到山东、河南、山西、湖北、黑龙江、辽宁等省，买到了二十八万头优良猪秧和一部分母猪。到年底，将发展到五十多万头。
    养猪大跃进产生了两个新问题：第一、原有社养户养的比例已经不适合新的情况。如果继续以户养为主，例如80％归户养，按全县六万多户计算，平均每户要养四头猪，到年底，就要达到每户七头左右，势必占用社员的劳动力，增加社的粪肥奖励开支；更严重的是由于养猪利大，势必助长社员的资本主义倾向，损害集体经济利益。县委为了避免这种情况，就积极地引导农业社，由户养为主经过社养户养并重而转入社养为主。对养猪户仍将给以适当的奖励和帮助。
    为了保证农业社把大量的猪养好，县委紧紧抓住了两个主要环节：
    一、发动群众克服饲料的困难。群众说：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找。”县委组织一批干部到安国等县去学习了养猪经验，随后派出三十多名干部，在八个社试办饲料加工站。各乡以负责养猪的乡党委副书记为首组成五人饲料加工指导小组，各生产队组成五至七名妇女和男半劳力的饲料搜集加工专业小组。试办结果，发现一百二十多种植物茎叶经过加工可作粗饲料。接着就举办展览会，推广到全县。现在，社社都有了饲料加工站，全县全年可加工二亿四千万斤，等到青饲料（苜蓿、薯类等）上场，饲料就绰绰有余了。
    二、开展防疫保健工作。农业社集中了大量的猪，一有疫病，就会顷刻蔓延，这是对社养为主方针的严重考验。县委首先集中了八百多名中、小学毕业生和社干部，训练出一支防疫保健队伍，现在社社都有畜牧指导股和畜牧诊疗所，每一千头猪有一名“猪医生”，每五百头猪有一名“保健员”。80％的猪圈建立了经常的消毒制度，半月用石灰抹一次圈，三、五天用热盐水洗一次槽。向阴圈改为向阳圈，有的猪圈改地窖，有的圈内加小圈，许多猪圈还挂上了草帘子并且在猪圈里面生火保温，让猪秧们舒适地度过冬天。有些社员还把南方来的小客人放到家里，抱到热炕上过冬。春暖即将来临，正是猪疫流行的季节，县委早在1月底就发出通报，规定2月上旬为防疫突击旬，展开了一个无病猪乡、无病猪社、无病猪队的竞赛运动。
    以社养为主发展养猪事业，对徐水县说来，完全是一件生疏的事情，时间、任务又很紧迫，因此，在开始一个时期内，县委投入了两个书记亲自领导。一个书记主持购买猪秧、搜集饲料、建立猪场、训练干部，并深入一个乡搞试点；一个书记主持参观养猪、专业会议、动员报告，每周汇报。在短短三个月内，从县到社建立了一条以养猪为重点的畜牧生产战线，各乡有一名乡支部副书记，各社有一名社长分工负责这项工作，并决定成立一个由商业局主持的畜牧公司，来管理养猪和其他畜牧生产。
