    A Note

    The Lee Seung-man regime has signed an agreement with the United States to import 50 million US dollars worth of surplus American grain from the United States. South Korea will import more than 760,000 tons of American wheat and other grains in the 1958 fiscal year, and the South Korean authorities will use 82% of the proceeds from the sale of these grains for military expenditures, with most of the remainder going to cover the US government's expenses in South Korea.
    For the United States, this is indeed a worthwhile deal. It can not only dump surplus agricultural products, but also force the Lee Seung-man regime to maintain huge military expenditures, and solve its expenses in South Korea, achieving three gains with one move.
    But for South Korea, this is a harmful and unprofitable transaction. South Korea used to be a grain exporter, but after years of American occupation, it has become a grain-deficient area. Last year, it had already imported 19 million US dollars worth of surplus grain from the United States. This method of quenching thirst with poison will undoubtedly make South Korea sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of starvation.

    一举三得
    李承晚政权同美国签订了一项南朝鲜从美国进口五千万美元美国剩余谷物的协定。南朝鲜将在1958财政年度输入七十六万多吨美国的小麦和其他谷物，而南朝鲜当局将把出售这些谷物所得的款项的82％用作军事开支，其余大部分将作为美国政府在南朝鲜的用费。
    对美国来说，这确是一笔合算的买卖。既可以倾销过剩农产品，又可以迫使李承晚政权维持庞大的军事开支，还可以解决它在南朝鲜的用费，一举三得。
    但是对于南朝鲜来说，这却是有害无益的交易。南朝鲜以前本来是出口粮食的，多年来在美国的占领下竟变成缺粮地区，上一年度已从美国进口了一千九百万美元的剩余谷物。这种饮鸩止渴的办法无疑将使南朝鲜在饥饿的泥潭中愈陷愈深。
