    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 16th: The United States' "Atlas" intercontinental missile failed again in a test on the 15th. When the Air Force attempted to launch such a missile at the Cape Canaveral test site in Florida, the missile only emitted a puff of white smoke but failed to lift off. According to the Air Force, the failure was due to "technical difficulties."
    The United States government has previously conducted five tests of launching the "Atlas" intercontinental missile. Only two of these achieved partial success, while the remaining three were failures.

    美国洲际导弹连试连败
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹15日又一次试验失败。当空军部在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角试验场发射一颗这样的导弹时，导弹只冒出一股白烟，但是却不能起飞。据空军部宣布，这次试验失败的原因是由于“技术上的困难”。
    美国政府以前也曾经就发射“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹进行过五次试验。但是只有两次取得部分的成功，其余三次都宣告失败。
