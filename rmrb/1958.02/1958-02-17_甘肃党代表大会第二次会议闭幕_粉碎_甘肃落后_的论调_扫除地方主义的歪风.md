Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th – The Second Session of the Second Gansu Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded on the 11th. The meeting put forward the inspiring slogan of "Boosting Enthusiasm, Fighting Hard for Three Years, Striving for Further Leaps in Industry and Agriculture, and Achieving the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in Six Years."

The preparatory meeting of the Delegates Congress began on December 13th of last year and lasted for a total of fifty-seven days. The formal meeting began on February 9th of this year. A total of 1,172 delegates and observers attended the meeting, including cadres from the province, special districts, counties, districts, townships, and communes, with 600 delegates among them.

The meeting first affirmed the great achievements made by the Party in leading rural work since 1956, criticized the right-leaning conservative ideology manifested in the "Gansu Backwardness Theory," and thoroughly exposed localism, local ethnic chauvinism, and the affluent middle peasant mentality among cadres. Some issues that had long been debated within the Gansu Party were clarified and a consensus was reached through airing of views and debates at this meeting. The delegates believed that this was a meeting of great ideological leap forward, a meeting to strengthen the unity of the Party, and that attending this meeting was truly "better than reading books for ten years."

Those who advocate the "Gansu Backwardness Theory":
	Turning a blind eye to advanced things, refusing to see the creative spirit of the masses

The meeting held that a right-leaning conservative ideology, manifested in the "Gansu Backwardness Theory," has long existed within and outside the Gansu Party. People with this kind of thinking tend to overemphasize the backward aspects of Gansu and the local objective difficulties, turning a blind eye to the vigorous creative spirit of the broad masses, and ignoring advanced things. Although Gansu has undergone tremendous changes in recent years, they still sigh and lament. They advocate that all work should be done "slowly," fearing that haste will lead to chaos. Although this kind of thinking has been constantly criticized in the past, it has not been eradicated at the root and always hinders the leap forward of various tasks. In 1956, due to the criticism of right-leaning conservative ideology within and outside the Party, a high tide led to the completion of 4 million mu of irrigated land throughout the province. In the second half of 1956 and the first half of 1957, because a gust of right-leaning wind blew, the momentum began to wane. The provincial Party committee initially proposed the task of building 3 million mu of irrigated land in 1957, but it could not be assigned. After repeated reductions, it was set at 1.35 million mu, but only 1.02 million mu were completed by the end of September. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, combined with the development of the rectification movement, everyone's enthusiasm was boosted again, and more than 5 million mu of irrigated land were built in four months this winter. This once again proves how important it is to criticize right-leaning conservative ideology for the great leap forward of various tasks.

Localists:
	Chanting the absurd tune of "Gansu People Governing Gansu," attempting to eliminate class struggle

The meeting also criticized the argument that "understanding lags behind reality" is not subjectivism, which was once the "theoretical" basis of right-leaning conservative ideology. Thoroughly criticizing this argument eradicated the roots of right-leaning conservative ideology from an epistemological point of view.

The meeting seriously criticized the serious localist tendencies within the Gansu Provincial Party organization. Localists have always denied the unity of the proletariat and emphasized the alliance of "local people." They are very enthusiastic about the reactionary slogan of "Gansu People Governing Gansu." They vigorously promoted the history of "Gansu local people" excluding foreign rulers, saying that this was the anti-foreign struggle of the Gansu people, used to negate class struggle, and used to prove that no matter what foreign rulers in history or foreign Communist Party members today, they are generally not welcomed by "Gansu people." These localists, who have no class perspective, advocate uniting with the exploiting class, the feudal upper class, and even reactionaries, or coexisting peacefully and not struggling. They do not care what class these "local people" represent, what policies they implement, nor what kind of people those "foreigners" are, what policies they implement, thinking that local people are good anyway, and foreigners are bad. Localists are generally status quo maintainers. They rely on backward forces and protect backward aspects, so they are most afraid of changing the status quo and least willing to face the strength of the masses. Localists have always only emphasized the particularity of Gansu and have no overall perspective. They use the excuse that Gansu's economy is backward, ethnic relations are complex, and natural conditions are poor to demand special treatment everywhere, that the work progress should be particularly slow, the burden should be particularly light, that the amount handed over to the state should be as little as possible, and that the amount asked from the state should be as much as possible. They do not subordinate the part to the whole, the local to the central government, but try every possible means to create special circumstances, attempting to turn Gansu into an independent kingdom at their disposal. Localists have always been factionalists. They exclude externally and push each other out internally. On the one hand, they oppose the Party's cadre policy of both ability and integrity, and promote their "old relationship, old subordinates" cadre policy. As long as they are "old relationships and old subordinates," they can be exempted from punishment for making mistakes, party membership can be given away casually, political history can be not examined, and job positions can be arranged casually. If the Party disagrees with their opinions, they will say that this is "foreign cadres rectifying local cadres." On the other hand, they slander the Party for not paying attention to cultivating local cadres, only emphasizing the importance of foreign cadres, and accuse foreign cadres of not being able to cooperate and work with local cadres, and not caring about the suffering of the people. The meeting carried out a serious exposure and sharp criticism of localist elements with these serious localist manifestations, greatly promoted the proletarian communist spirit of righteousness, and improved the political consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and party members. The meeting held that the criticism of localism not only strengthened the unity of the Party, but also attacked right-leaning conservative ideology.

Revolutionary Vigor Washes Away Senility, Striving for Further Leaps in Production

On the basis of the great ideological leap forward, the meeting proposed that the people of the province must boost their revolutionary enthusiasm and strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in six years. The meeting also determined the main targets for the Second Five-Year Plan, which are advanced and inspiring for Gansu, where natural conditions are quite difficult. By 1962, the total grain output of Gansu (excluding the areas to be assigned to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) should reach 18.2 billion catties. The grain yield per mu should reach 350 catties. The total cotton output should reach 2.4 million dan, and the cotton yield per mu should reach 80 catties. The area of irrigated land and watered land should reach 40 million mu. The area of soil and water conservation should reach 150,000 square kilometers. The multiple cropping area should reach 167 million mu, accounting for 21% of the total area. The total output value of local industry (excluding handicrafts) should reach 2.4 billion to 2.8 billion yuan. As long as the above targets are achieved, by 1962, each agricultural person in the province will have an average of more than three mu of irrigated land, and the drought situation can be fundamentally changed. The province will have an average of more than 1,240 catties of grain per person, and the grain problem can be fundamentally solved. At the same time, the output value of local industry can also approach or catch up with the output value of agriculture. The industrial output value per capita can reach 210 yuan. At that time, all agricultural cooperatives can exceed the production level of well-to-do middle peasants.

The meeting also discussed the issue of changing customs and habits, and demanded that the people of the province, with the heroic spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," basically eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, lice, and sandflies within three years, and make Gansu a "seven-without province" after five years. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, we must also launch a high tide of education and culture, and strive to basically achieve universal education and eliminate illiteracy within three years.

When the representatives discussed how to strive for a great leap forward in Gansu's industrial and agricultural production, their emotions were warm and their speeches were enthusiastic. The gloom brought by individual regions and some representatives was quickly washed away by the revolutionary vigor overflowing at the meeting. The news of victory after victory from various places also constantly influenced the meeting. Under this momentum of riding the wind and waves and striving for the upper reaches, the meeting drew up the industrial and agricultural production targets for 1958, and decided to win a great victory in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1958, the total grain output of the province (excluding the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) will increase by 2.3 billion catties compared with 1957, and the total cotton output will increase from 176,000 dan in 1957 to 350,000 dan. 10 million mu of water conservancy projects will be built, and 25,000 square kilometers of soil and water conservation will be completed. The province will strive to have 14 counties with a yield of 400 catties per mu, 9 counties with 500 catties, and launch a movement of 10,000 Dengjiabao (the province's model of soil and water conservation). The total output value of local industry will increase from 150 million yuan to 310 million yuan.

We Must Strengthen the Party's Leadership and Strive to Achieve Production Plans

In order to strive for a great leap forward in Gansu's industrial and agricultural production, the meeting believed that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership in all aspects, and Party organizations at all levels must give full play to their role in promoting. To this end, first of all, we must give play to the subjective initiative of people, understand and grasp the laws of nature, and systematically transform nature. Secondly, we must go deep into reality, sum up experience, and seriously engage in experimental fields, experimental factories, experimental workshops, experimental handicraft cooperatives, and experimental stores. The responsible comrades of the provincial Party committee, prefectural Party committees, and county Party committees must personally engage in experimental fields. In order to ensure the universal implementation of this method, it is necessary to establish a system for responsible cadres at all levels to go down in rotation. Responsible comrades of the province should spend at least four months a year at the grassroots level, responsible comrades of prefectural committees and special districts should spend half a year, and responsible comrades of counties should spend eight months. Only in this way can leaders at all levels truly go deep down and obtain real experience. Third, all places should strengthen contact and communicate with each other. In order to cooperate with each other, support each other, and promote each other in the struggle to transform nature and in other various tasks, to solve problems in a timely manner, and to exchange experiences, appropriate regional ties should be established between special districts and special districts, between counties and counties, and between townships and townships. Some meetings in the province can be held in separate groups according to these connections. Fourth, we must implement the leadership method of comparison and the leadership method of grasping both ends (advanced and backward) and driving the middle. All departments, special districts and special districts, counties and counties, townships and townships, cooperatives and cooperatives should compare with each other, compare the advanced, compare the work, compare the enthusiasm, compare the vigor, compare the ambition, compare the leadership, compare the study, etc., and various meetings should also compare, so that they can constantly push the backward forward and make the advanced more advanced. Fifth, all comrades, especially comrades in business departments and scientific and technological circles, must overcome the idea of only being expert and not red, and must make their business and technology subordinate to politics and serve politics. Comrades in Party and government leading organs must eliminate officialdom and overcome the phenomenon of empty talk. They must work hard to study and gradually become experts in their business. In order to make technical cadres and intellectuals both red and expert, in addition to organizing them to seriously study Marxism-Leninism, they must also be organized to participate in physical labor, so that they can undergo a transformation through physical labor and gradually become intellectuals of the working class.

This meeting also powerfully promoted the rectification movement of provincial-level organs. During the meeting, the delegates put forward many opinions to the provincial-level organs, and the relevant units checked their work according to these opinions and submitted written reports on the results of the handling to the meeting.

    甘肃党代表大会第二次会议闭幕
    粉碎“甘肃落后”的论调  扫除地方主义的歪风
    据新华社兰州16日电　中共甘肃省第二届代表大会第二次会议已经在11日闭幕。会议提出了“鼓起干劲、苦战三年，力争工农业跃进再跃进，六年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”的振奋人心的口号。
    代表大会的预备会议从去年12月13日开始，共开了五十七天。正式会议在今年2月9日起举行。参加会议的代表和列席人员共一千一百七十二人，包括省、专、县、区、乡、社六级干部，其中代表有六百人。
    会议首先肯定了从1956年以来党在领导农村工作中所获得的巨大成就，批判了以“甘肃落后论”为表现形式的右倾保守思想，彻底揭露了地方主义、地方民族主义和干部中的富裕中农思想。有些在甘肃党内长期存在着争论的问题，在这次会议上经过鸣放和辩论，在认识上取得了一致。代表们认为这是一次思想大跃进的会议，增强党的团结的会议，参加这次会议真是“胜读十年书”。
    “甘肃落后论”者：
    对先进事物熟视无睹闭眼不看群众创造精神
    会议认为，甘肃党内外长期存在着以“甘肃落后论”为表现形式的右倾保守思想。有这样思想的人，往往过分强调甘肃的落后方面和当地的客观困难，闭眼不看广大群众生气勃勃的创造精神，对于先进事物熟视无睹。甘肃这些年来虽然有了天翻地复的变化，他们还是一味唉声叹气。他们主张一切工作都要“慢慢来”，惟恐快了会出乱子。这种思想过去虽然不断地受到批判，但并没有连根拔掉，总是时隐时现地阻碍着各项工作的跃进。1956年由于在党内外批判了右倾保守思想，一个高潮全省就完成了四百万亩水地。1956年下半年和1957年上半年，因为吹来了一股右倾歪风，开始泄了劲，省委起初提出1957年兴修三百万亩水地的任务就分配不下去，后来一减再减，才确定为一百三十五万亩，但是到9月底仅完成一百零二万亩。党的八届三中全会以后，结合整风运动的开展，又鼓起了大家的干劲，这个冬季四个月内就兴修了五百多万亩水地。这就再一次证明，批判右倾保守思想对于各项工作的大跃进是多么重要。
    地方主义者：
    高唱“甘人治甘”滥调  妄图取消阶级斗争
    会议还批判了所谓认识落后于现实不是主观主义的论调，这种论调曾经是右倾保守思想的“理论”根据。彻底批判这种论调就从认识论上挖掉了右倾保守思想的根子。
    会议严肃地批判了甘肃省党组织内的严重的地方主义倾向。地方主义者从来否认无产阶级的团结，强调“地方人”的联合。他们非常热衷于“甘人治甘”这个反动口号。他们大肆宣扬“甘肃地方人”排斥外来统治者的历史，把这说成是甘肃人的排外斗争，用来否定阶级斗争，用来证明不管历史上的外来统治者也好，今天外来的共产党员也好，一概不受“甘肃人”的欢迎。这些毫无阶级观点的地方主义者，主张和剥削阶级、封建上层甚至反动分子联合起来，或者和平相处，不要斗争。他们不管这些“地方人”代表什么样的阶级，执行什么样的政策，也不管那些“外来人”是什么样的人，执行什么样的政策，认为反正本地的就好，外来的就不好。地方主义者一般的是现状维持派，他们依靠的是落后势力，保护的是落后方面，因此最害怕改变现状，也最不愿意正视群众的力量。地方主义者向来只强调甘肃的特殊，而没有全局的观点。他们借口甘肃经济落后，民族关系复杂，自然条件不好，处处要求特殊，工作进度要特别慢，负担要特别轻，交给国家的越少越好，向国家要的越多越好。他们不是局部服从整体，地方服从中央，而是千方百计地制造特殊，企图把甘肃变成一个由他们随意支配的独立王国。地方主义者又从来都是宗派主义者，他们对外排斥，对内倾轧。他们一方面反对党的德才兼备的干部政策，推行他们“旧关系、老部下”的“干部政策”。只要是“旧关系老部下”，犯了错误可以不处分，党籍可以随便赠予，政治历史可以不审查，工作职位可以随便安排。如果党不同意他们的意见，他们就说这是“外来干部整地方干部”。另一方面，他们又诬蔑党不重视培养地方干部，只重用外来干部，并且指责外来干部不能和地方干部合作共事，不关心人民疾苦。会议对于具有这些严重的地方主义表现的地方主义分子进行了认真的揭露和尖锐的批评，大大发扬了无产阶级的共产主义的正气，提高了广大干部和党员的政治觉悟。会议认为，对于地方主义的批判不但增强了党的团结，同时也打击了右倾保守思想。
    革命朝气冲洗了暮气  力争生产跃进再跃进
    会议在思想大跃进的基础上，提出了全省人民一定要鼓起革命干劲，奋斗六年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的口号，确定了第二个五年计划的各项主要指标，这些指标在自然条件相当困难的甘肃来说，是先进的，是振奋人心的。到1962年甘肃粮食总产量（不包括将要划归宁夏回族自治区的地区在内）要达到一百八十二亿斤。粮食亩产量达到三百五十斤。棉花总产量达到二百四十万担，棉花亩产量达到八十斤。水地、水浇地要达到四千万亩。水土保持面积，要达到十五万平方公里。复种面积达到一亿六千七百万亩，占总面积的21％。地方工业总产值（不包括手工业）要达到二十四亿到二十八亿元。只要达到了上述各项指标，到1962年，全省每一农业人口平均就可有三亩多水浇地，干旱面貌可以基本上改观。全省每人平均有一千二百四十多斤粮食，粮食问题就可以根本上解决。同时，地方工业的产值也可以接近或赶上农业的产值。工业产值按人口平均可以达到二百一十元。那时，所有农业社都可以超过富裕中农的生产水平。
    会议还讨论了移风易俗的问题，要求全省人民以“愚公移山”的英雄气概，在三年内基本上消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、虱子、白蛉子等，五年后使甘肃变成“七无省”。随着工农业生产的大跃进，同时要掀起一个教育文化的高潮，争取在三年内基本上实现普及教育，扫除文盲。
    代表们在讨论如何力争甘肃工农业的大跃进时，情绪热烈，发言踊跃，有个别地区、部分代表带来的一股暮气，很快就被会议上洋溢着的革命朝气冲洗干净。各专区代表分别提出要提前四年、五年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的战斗口号，并且互相展开了友谊竞赛。张掖专区提出的口号是：“十年指标一年完成，三年跨黄河，八年过长江”，力争把河西走廊提早建设成为甘肃高额丰产粮棉基地。全省最干旱的定西专区提出要在五年内实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），把定西专区建设成为甘肃的粮油基地。这个专区五年内粮食亩产量要达到五百斤，争取达到六百斤，每人平均有粮食三千斤。1957年这个区有一百五十万亩水地，五年内要发展到一千五百万亩水地，水地就占耕地面积的90％。
    会议开始举行的时候，甘肃农村正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的冬季生产高潮。会议的精神迅速地传到各个战线上，对广大群众起着极大的鼓舞作用。而各地传来的一个接着一个的胜利消息，也时时影响着会议。在这种乘风破浪、力争上游的气势下，会议拟出了1958年的工农业生产指标，决计在第二个五年计划的头一年赢得一个大胜利。1958年全省（不包括宁夏回族自治区）粮食总产量比1957年增加二十三亿斤，棉花总量由1957年的一七·六万担，增加到三十五万担。兴修水利一千万亩，完成水土保持二万五千平方公里。全省要争取出现十四个亩产四百斤的县，九个五百斤的县，并展开一万个邓家堡（全省水土保持模范）运动。地方工业总产值要由一·五亿元增加到三·一亿元。
    必须加强党的领导争取实现生产的规划
    为了力争甘肃工农业生产的大跃进，会议认为必须从各方面加强党的领导，各级党组织一定要充分发挥促进作用。为此，首先要发挥人的能动性，认识和掌握自然的规律，对自然进行系统的改造。其次要深入实际，总结经验，认真搞试验田、试验厂、试验车间、试验手工业社、试验商店等。省委、地委、县委的负责同志，都要亲自搞试验田。为了保证这种方法的普遍推行，必须确定各级负责干部轮流下去的制度。省的负责同志每年至少要有四个月在下面，地委、专区负责同志应当有半年，县的负责同志应当有八个月。只有这样，各级领导才能真正深入下去，才能取得真正的经验。第三，各地要加强联系，互通声气。为了在改造自然的斗争和其他种种工作上互相配合、互相支持、互相推动，及时解决问题，交流经验，专区和专区之间、县和县之间、乡和乡之间，都应该建立适当的区域联系。省里有些会议可以根据这些联系分片召开。第四，要实行对比的领导方法，实行抓两头（先进、落后）、带动中间的领导方法。各部门之间，专区和专区、县和县、乡和乡、社和社之间，都要互相比较，要比先进、比工作、比劲头、比朝气、比志气、比领导、比学习等，各种会议也要比，这样就可以不断地把落后推向前进，使先进的更加先进。第五，所有同志，特别是业务部门和科学技术界的同志，必须克服那些只专不红的思想，必须使自己的业务和技术服从政治，服务于政治。党政领导机关的同志，必须打掉官气，克服讲空话的现象。要努力钻研，在业务上逐步变成内行。为了使技术干部、知识分子达到又红又专，除了组织他们认真学习马克思列宁主义外，还要组织他们参加体力劳动，通过体力劳动使他们脱胎换骨，逐步变成工人阶级的知识分子。
    这次会议还有力地推动了省级各机关的整风运动。会议期间，代表们对省级机关提出了不少意见，有关单位根据这些意见检查了自己的工作，并且将处理的结果向会议作了书面报告。
