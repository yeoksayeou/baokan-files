One Day of Water Conservancy Upsurge
Xinhua News Agency collective creation

On February 7th, seven million working people in Guangdong Province continued to battle on thousands of water conservancy construction sites, creating earth-shattering feats with their ordinary hands. Its scale is too grand and its vitality too vivid to be fully captured or described by any single pen. Here are just a few snippets of scenes that reporters witnessed on the same day.

From Dawn to Dusk

February 7th marked the beginning of the fortieth day of the Wunihwan Reservoir project in Meicun, Yingde County, northern Guangdong. At dawn, the construction site, spanning two to three square *li*, was already bustling with people. Braving the cold weather, people carried soil barefoot in the mud. Eight people in a group, using ropes to tie forty- *jin* stones, pounded the earth with a rate of thirty-five strokes per minute. More than fifty laborers pulled an eight thousand- *jin* stone roller, shouting and rolling on the new soil. Herds of cattle, ridden by cowherds, turned circles on the ground, trampling the soil. Young male and female laborers competed with each other, carrying soil from the mountains at a rapid pace over a distance of more than four hundred meters. They wanted to complete the reservoir before the Spring Festival so that 3,600 *mu* of farmland could be permanently free from disasters. They called this "a year of hard work for ten thousand years of happiness."

At precisely twelve o'clock at night, as the reporter was writing in the construction site headquarters, the sound of pounding could still be heard outside. Looking out into the distance by moonlight, the teams carrying mud were still moving continuously.

At the Zhuzijia Mountain pass, forty-five meters high and one hundred and fifty meters long, hundreds of skilled laborers were fiercely attacking the mountain rocks, aiming to lower the pass by thirty-seven meters and excavate it into a river channel tens of meters wide. This was the most challenging part of the project. The laborers declared: "We won't go home for the Spring Festival until Zhuzijia lowers its head." The members of the Xinqiao Youth Shock Brigade had been working in the mountain pass for two days and one night without coming down since 00:00 on the 5th. That night, they continued to challenge and compete with the Jiangbu Youth Shock Brigade for the mobile red flag. Late at night, it suddenly started to rain, and the wind-driven rain stung people's faces. The shock brigade members put on raincoats and bamboo hats, still braving the wind and rain, and carried soil back and forth on the muddy slopes. The rain kept falling, and everyone kept working relentlessly without rest. It was not until the lights on the construction site gradually went out that they were the last group to come down the mountain. By this time, it was 00:30 on February 7th.

New Guests

At 7:00 PM on February 7th, the Wunihwan Water Conservancy Headquarters received a group of new guests from a neighboring township. A young representative asked the local District Party Secretary in an inquiring tone: "The hundred-plus people who have come to support us have decided to start work at 4:00 AM every day and finish at 11:00 PM. What do you think?"

Where does this drive come from? Grassroots cadres told us: "This is mainly the result of socialist education and great debates conducted among the peasants." He said that last year, some laborers could earn 70 cents for every cubic meter of earth moved, plus a subsidy of six *liang* of rice, but they were still unwilling to work hard. Now, more than 3,000 laborers from neighboring townships have come to support us, asking for no pay, bringing their own food, and still working hard. Everything is changing now, and this is socialism!

Land Boats and Aerial Transportation

On a water conservancy construction site in the Pearl River Delta, several small boats with four large wooden wheels attached to the bottom were carrying soil in place of people in the black, soft mud. This was the creation of the members of the First Village Cooperative of Baida Township, Xinhui County.

The area where the First Village Cooperative is now building water conservancy projects is a pot-shaped sandy field surrounded by dikes, filled with ditches, barren land, and depressions. They decided to destroy all the old ditches, depressions, and barren land, level the land, and re-dig the drainage and irrigation system. However, this project involved a huge amount of work. If they relied on people carrying soil, they would not be confident of completing it before the Spring Festival. Therefore, the Township Party Secretary and the cooperative members converted a large number of small river transport boats in the cooperative into land boats. Using small boats pushed by people, pulled by ropes, or drawn by cattle to transport soil increased labor efficiency twelvefold.

If you think the "land boats" of the Pearl River Delta are strange, then you can't help but exclaim when you see the Jilishan water conservancy construction site near Qinzhou County.

Here, there are five or six aerial transportation lines on the construction site. In an instant, soil flies from this mountain to that mountain. There are wooden double tracks on the ground, and wooden "small trains" carrying soil shuttle back and forth automatically. These are all creations of the peasants.

When the reporter arrived at the construction site on the 7th, it was a sunny and warm day, and the construction site was particularly lively. The hissing sound of the aerial transportation lines, the creaking sound of the wooden trains on the ground, and the mountain songs of the laborers mixed together, echoing through the valley.

Here, there are also several newly created soil transportation methods being tested, including the ground iron cable soil transportation method, which can transport 15,000 kilograms of mud each time; the sliding bamboo soil transportation method, which can continuously slide mud baskets filled with soil to the dam head; and the soil raking method, which uses cattle to drag iron rakes to rake the soil to the sliding ditch, and so on.

At 6:00 PM that evening, the reporter heard Zhang Zhaosheng, the deputy director of the construction site, announce the day's achievements over the loudspeaker: a total of 1,574 cubic meters of earth were moved, nearly three times more than the 400-plus cubic meters done each day before the implementation of technical innovations, and the number of laborers on duty was reduced by more than 400 compared to before.

Everyone Contributes a Share

Leaving the bustling water conservancy construction site and arriving at the villages of Fucheng Township, Qingyuan County, is a different scene. Here, there are no waving hoes and shovels, and no endless streams of people carrying soil. Instead, pigs and cattle roam freely in the courtyards, and children play in groups. There is not the same lively labor scene as on the construction site, but there is not a single idle person.

Old Grandpa Huang Yingxiu of Changpu Village was holding Manlan, a one-year-old from the neighbor's house, and basking in the sun at the door. Grandpa Huang is eighty years old this year and blind. He heard that the government was going to build water conservancy projects to completely control the floods and was extremely happy. Since he can remember, the water flowing down from Mount Bijia has meant that this place has never escaped floods for a single year. Grandpa Huang has suffered countless hardships. Now, although he cannot directly participate in labor, he keeps Manlan well-behaved so that her parents can work on water conservancy projects with peace of mind.

Old Granny Huang Zhou, who has been blind for many years, is not idle either. She is groping to change diapers for Shui Lian, a five-month-old girl from across the street, and then groping to the corner of the house to feed the already chopped wild vegetables to the six geese that are squawking beside her. This is also what she is taking care of for the couple across the street who are carrying soil.

Even elderly people like Grandpa Huang and Granny Huang Zhou, who are already disabled, have their own work to do. Chen Dagu, an octogenarian who is one of the "Five Guarantees" households and not disabled, is even more useful. She carries one child on her back, leads two others by the hand, and also takes care of the pigs and chickens in the yard.

It is even livelier at noon. Boys and girls aged thirteen or fourteen, and old grandpas and grandmas aged fifty or sixty, each carrying a baby under one year old on their backs, go to the construction site in groups to find their mothers for breastfeeding.

On the morning of the 7th, the reporter also visited the Gongguan Town of Maoming County, near the Jianjiang Water Conservancy Project in western Guangdong. I looked at the doors of almost all of the nearly 300 households in this market town. Most of the doors were locked. Most of these households had gone to the construction site. In the houses with open doors, there were either elderly people or groups of children playing. Many of the staff of banks, post offices, grain and other agencies and stores worked half a day in the office and half a day at the construction site to provide support.

The reporter visited an ironware and agricultural tool production cooperative in the town. However, the members of the cooperative had all gone to the construction site today. Neighbors told the reporter that in order to support the construction of water conservancy projects and ensure the supply of tools, the 27 members of the cooperative had been working hard for more than two months, starting before dawn and going to bed late at night. They not only insisted on working more than 14 hours a day, but also tried every means to improve work efficiency. In the past, it took 14 furnace firings to produce a hoe. During this period, on the premise of ensuring quality, they reduced the number of furnace firings by half.

The residents of Gongguan Town and the peasants on both sides of the Jianjiang River, with this spirit, unprecedentedly cut off the greatly harmful river in the south of the motherland and split off half of the fifteen mountains blocking the canals. The historical drought in the Maonan Plain is about to be eliminated.

At the Headquarters

In the morning, the reporter came to Puyang Township, sixty *li* away from Lianjiang County on the Leizhou Peninsula. In a vast expanse of rolling hills, near the village, there is a small house. This is the office of the Lianjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Entering the office of this county Party committee, one cannot see any trace of an office atmosphere. Most of the dozen or so rooms upstairs and downstairs are locked or the doors are ajar. Most people have gone to various water conservancy construction sites around the area to inspect the work as soon as it dawns. The few people who remain at home have built this small house into a battlefield command post. In this house, there are seven or eight telephones and a switchboard. The comrades responsible for collecting information from various townships said that they were busy every night until one or two o'clock in the morning before they rested, and they are now busy talking to various places.

The Lianjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China moved here from the county seat in late December last year. The county party congress held at that time required the county party committee to deeply lead the water conservancy work. The day after the meeting closed, the county party committee office moved to this place, the most severely drought-stricken place in the county.

An official at the command post said that now, except for individual members who are still staying in the county seat to continue working, they have all come down. Under their influence, all 33 township party committees in the county have moved to key project construction sites and the most severely drought-stricken communities to deeply lead the work. All Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and township and community cadres in the county's rural areas are standing at the forefront of water conservancy construction.

    水利高潮一日
    新华社记者集体创作
    7日，广东省七百万劳动人民，继续战斗在千千万万的水利工地上，用一双双普通的手，创造着惊天动地的事业。它气魄太大，过于生动，任何一枝笔都概括不了，描述不了。这里只是记者在同日看到的一些片断的场面。
    从黎明到夜晚
    7日，粤北英德县美村乌泥湾水库工程刚刚步入第四十天。7日天刚亮，方圆两三华里的工地上已经到处都是人流，人们迎着寒冷的天气赤脚在泥泞中挑土。八个人一组用绳系着四十斤重的石块以一分钟三十五下的速度上下打硪压土，五十多个民工拉着八千斤重的石滚吆喝着在新土上滚动，耕牛三五成群由牧童骑着在地上团团打转踏土。年青的男女民工互相竞赛，从四百多公尺的运距，健步如飞地自山上把泥土挑下来。他们要在春节前把水库修好，使三千六百亩田永远清除灾患。他们把这叫作“一年辛苦万年福”。
    夜晚十二时正，记者在工地指挥部执笔时，户外仍然一片打硪声。乘着月光往外远眺，蠕动着的挑泥的队伍络绎不断。
    在四十五公尺高、一百五十公尺长的猪仔夹山坳里，好几百名精干的民工正在向山石强攻，要把山坳打下三十七公尺、凿通成为一条几十公尺宽的河道。这里是工程最艰巨的地方。民工们提出：猪仔夹不低头就不回家过春节。新桥青年突击队的队员，打从5日零时起就在山坳里干了两天一夜、没有下山。这晚，他们照样与江步青年突击队挑战竞赛，争夺流动红旗。深夜，忽然下起雨来，雨乘风势打得人们脸孔作痛。突击队员穿上蓑衣，戴起竹笠，仍然顶着风雨，踏着泥泞的坡道，来回不停地挑土。雨无休止地下，大家也不知休息地一个劲干。直到工地上的灯火渐渐息灭了，他们才最后一批走下山来，这时，已是2月7日零时三十分。
    新来的客人
    7日晚七时，乌泥湾水利指挥部里到了一批自邻乡来的新客。一个年青的代表用探询的口气问这里的区委书记：我们来支援的一百多个人，决定在今后每日早上四时开工，夜十一时收工，你看行不？
    这股干劲从什么地方来？基层干部对我们说：这主要是在农民中进行了社会主义教育和大辩论的结果。他说，在去年，一些民工们每搞一土方能拿到七角钱，还补贴六两米，可是他们还不愿意干。现在，邻乡的三千多民工来支援我们，不要报酬，自带口粮，还是用劲的干。现在一切都在变，这就是社会主义嘛！
    陆地行舟和空中运输
    在珠江三角洲的一个水利工地上，几只底下装上四只大木轮的小艇，正在乌黑松软的烂泥里代人载运泥土。它是新会县百大乡一村社社员们的创造。
    一村社现在修水利的这个地方，是一块锅底形的沙田大围，围内布满着水沟、荒基和洼地。他们决定把所有的旧水沟、洼地、荒基全部毁掉，整平土地，重新挖排灌纲。但是这个工程做起来工作量太大了，如果靠人挑土，春节前没有把握完成。于是，乡党委书记和社员们把社里原有大量的小河运输艇改装成陆用艇。用人推、绳纤或牛拉着的小艇来运土，劳动效率提高了十二倍。
    如果你看了珠江三角洲的“陆地行舟”觉得稀奇，那么，你再看看靠近钦县鸡笠山水利工地，就禁不住要失声叫好了。
    这儿的工地上，有五、六条空中运输线，霎那之间，泥土从这个山头便飞到了那个山头；地上有木制双轨道，木头“小火车”载着土穿梭似地自动来往。这些全是农民的创造。
    7日记者到工地的时候，正当天晴日暖，工地特别活跃。空中运输线发出的嘶嘶声，地上木头火车发出的轧轧声，和民工们的山歌声混在一起，响彻山谷。
    在这里，还有几种刚刚创造的新的运土方法在试行，其中有每次可运三万斤泥的地面铁索运泥法；可以连续不停地把盛着泥土的泥筐滑至坝首的滑竹运泥法；以耕牛拖铁耙把泥土耙至滑沟上的耙泥法等等。
    这天黄昏六点钟，记者听到工地副主任张兆生用广播筒宣布了这天的成绩：共做土方一千五百七十四个，比未实行技术革新时每天做四百多土方提高了近三倍，而出勤的劳动力却比以前减少了四百多个。
    人人贡献一分力量
    离开轰轰烈烈的水利工地来到清远县附城乡的各个村庄，另是一番景象。这里没有挥动着的锄头和铁锹，更没有穿梭不息的担泥的人流，而是猪牛满院漫步，儿童成群嘻戏，这里没有工地上那么热火朝天的劳动情景，却也没有一个闲人。
    长埔村的黄应修老大爷抱着邻屋的一岁的满兰在门口晒太阳。黄老大爷今年八十岁了，眼睛又失明了，他听说政府要修水利，彻底治理水灾，高兴极了。他从记事以来，笔架山上流下来的水，使这个地方没有一年逃脱过水灾。黄老大爷不知吃过了多少苦头。现在他虽然不能直接参加劳动，他却把满兰带得乖乖，让他的爸爸妈妈都安心地去修水利。
    眼睛失明了多年的黄周氏老太婆这个时候也没有闲着，她正在摸着给对门五个月的小女孩水莲换尿布，然后摸着到屋角去把已经切好的野菜揣给正在旁边呱呱叫的六只鹅吃，这也是她给对门担泥去的两夫妇管养的。
    像黄老大爷和黄周氏这样已经残废的老人，尚且有自己分内的工作，没有残废的五保户——八十多岁的陈大姑目前更是有用的人了，她背着一个，牵着两个还附带地照管着院里的猪呀、鸡的。
    一到中午就更热闹了，十三四岁的男孩女孩，五六十岁的老大爷老大娘，每人背着一个不满一岁的娃娃成群结队到工地上去找母亲吃奶。
    记者在7日上午又访问了靠近粤西鉴江水利工程的茂名县公馆镇，几乎看遍了这个墟镇的近三百户人家的大门，门上有锁的占多数，这些人家多到工地上去了。门户开着的，屋内不是年老的长者，就是三五成群的孩子们在玩耍。所有银行、邮政、粮食等机关和商店的工作人员，不少时候是半天在机关工作，半天到工地去支援。
    记者访问了镇上的一家铁器农具生产合作社。可是社员们今天都上工地了。邻近的人告记者说，为了支援兴修水利保证供应工具，这个合作社的二十七位社员起五更睡半夜地干了两个多月。他们不仅每天坚持十四个小时以上工作，还想尽一切办法提高工作效率。往常生产一把锄头需要经十四次炉火，这期间他们在保证质量的前提下，将炉火次数减少了一半。
    公馆镇的居民们与鉴江两岸的农民们，就以这股干劲，把祖国南边为害很大的河流破天荒地拦腰截断，将十五座挡着渠道的山岭劈去了半边。茂南平原历史性的干旱就要消灭了。
    在指挥所里
　　早上，记者来到了雷州半岛上距离廉江县城六十里的铺洋乡。在一片丘陵起伏的旷野上，靠近村边，有一座小屋。这便是中共廉江县委会的办公室。
    进入这个县委机关的办公室里，看不出一点点机关的味道。屋子里上下两层的十多个房间大都上了锁或虚掩房门，人们多在天刚亮就到周围各个水利工地去检查工作。留在家里的少数人把这所小房子建成了一个战地指挥所。在这个屋子里，安装着七、八部电话机和一台总机。负责收集各乡情况的同志们说，他们每天晚上忙到一两点钟才休息，现在正和各地紧张地通话。
    中共廉江县委是去年12月下旬从县城搬到这里来办公的。那时召开的县党代表大会，要求县委深入领导水利工作。会议闭幕后的第二天，县委办公室便搬到这个全县受旱灾最严重的地方来。
    指挥所的一位干部说，现在除个别委员仍留县城坚持工作外，都下来了。全县三十三个乡党委在他们的影响下，都搬到了重点工程工地和受旱灾最严重的社深入领导。全县农村中的共产党员、共青团员和乡社干部都站在兴修水利的最前列。　（本报有删节）
