Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: The city of Guangzhou held a representative meeting of advanced producers from the 8th to the 9th. The 1,400 representatives attending discussed how to launch a new upsurge in production and construction and proposed a battle cry to all workers in the city in response to the People's Daily editorial's call - resolutely break with convention for the Spring Festival.

The first to jump on stage to respond to the People's Daily's call to "break convention for the Spring Festival" was She Junnan, chief engineer of the Guangzhou City Urban Construction Design Institute. He said that last year, coal miners across the country took two days less vacation during the Spring Festival and produced hundreds of thousands of tons more raw coal for the country. This exemplary behavior is a model for all workers in our city. He said that in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, our working class should overcome all difficulties, break with convention, and resolutely complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state. During the Spring Festival, we must strive not to go home if we can avoid it, and not to return early if we can delay our return. Several other representatives then expressed their firm support for the People's Daily's call.

Liao Limin, Chairman of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, requested at the end of the meeting that all the advanced producers and advanced workers present lead the city's workers to launch a new upsurge in production, ensure the completion and overfulfillment of production tasks during the Spring Festival, and arrange frugal and simple recreational activities during the Spring Festival holiday.

At the meeting, many representatives also put forward proposals and challenges for comparing quality and catching up with advanced levels.

　　能不回家就不回家　能迟回家就迟回家
    响应号召打破常规过春节
    广州先进生产者要带动群众勤俭度假期
    新华社广州9日电　广州市在8日到9日举行了先进生产者代表会议。到会的一千四百名代表讨论了如何掀起生产、建设新高潮的问题，并且向全市职工提出了响应人民日报社论号召的战斗口号——坚决打破常规过春节。
    第一个跑上讲台响应人民日报“打破常规过春节”号召的，是广州市城市建筑设计院总工程师佘俊南。他说，去年全国煤矿职工在春节少休假两天，为国家多生产了几十万吨原煤。这种模范行为，是我们全市职工的榜样。他说，在第二个五年计划的头一年，我们工人阶级应该克服一切困难，打破常规，坚决完成党和国家交给我们的任务。在春节期间，我们要作到能不回家就不回去，能迟回家的就不早回去。接着，有好几个代表先后表示坚决响应人民日报的号召。
    广州市工会联合会主席廖立民在会议结束时，要求到会的全体先进生产者、先进工作者，要带动全市职工，掀起生产新高潮，保证在春节期间完成和超额完成生产任务，并且要勤俭朴素地安排春假期间的文娱生活。
    在会上，许多代表还提出了比质量、赶先进的倡议书和挑战书。
