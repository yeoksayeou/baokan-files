Xinhua News Agency, 4th - China will expand the irrigated area of farmland by 500 million mu during the second five-year plan, and the area of soil and water conservation will reach 570,000 square li. Li Baohua, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Water Conservancy, presented this target in a report at the first national congress of the Chinese Agricultural Water Conservancy Trade Union on the 3rd.

Li Baohua said that the country is currently in an unprecedented upsurge of agricultural production centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, which is larger in scale than the production upsurge from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956. According to preliminary statistics up to January 31, the projects built nationwide since last October can expand the irrigated area by 117.89 million mu, exceeding the plan to expand the irrigated area by 92.21 million mu for the entire year of 1958; during the same period, the area of improved irrigation, soil and water conservation, and flood drainage nationwide has also exceeded 50 million to 70 million mu. With these newly expanded irrigated areas, plus the original irrigated areas, the total irrigated area nationwide has exceeded 600 million mu, roughly averaging one mu of irrigated land per person. Together with the results of soil and water conservation, this achievement has greatly enhanced drought resistance. On a national scale, the threat of drought has been basically resolved. These achievements in farmland water conservancy construction have also laid the foundation for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Li Baohua said that the tremendous achievements made in the national upsurge of water conservancy construction prove that carrying out mass water conservancy construction movements can fundamentally change China's arid landscape within three years. He said that the national upsurge of water conservancy construction is still developing. Judging from the situation from last October to the present, the irrigated area that has already been expanded is more than 110 million mu. If most parts of the country experience several more upsurges of water conservancy construction, the national irrigated area can reach more than 1 billion mu, which can basically realize water conservancy and achieve the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) to basically eliminate common floods and droughts within twelve years, five years ahead of schedule.

Finally, Li Baohua put forward specific guidelines for completing the water conservancy construction tasks of the second five-year plan. He said that future water conservancy construction work must implement the comprehensive management principle of combining flood prevention, flood drainage, irrigation, soil and water conservation, power generation, and navigation, and the principle of centralized management by rivers. It must implement the principle of "emphasizing storage, supplemented by discharge," "mainly small-scale, supplemented by medium-scale, while establishing necessary possible large-scale projects."

　　全国在五年内基本实现水利化
    扩大灌溉面积五亿亩，提前消灭普通水旱灾害
    李葆华在农业水利工会代表大会上提出计划指标
    新华社4日讯　我国在第二个五年计划期间将要扩大农田灌溉面积五亿亩，水土保持的面积也将达到五十七万平方里。水利部副部长李葆华3日在中国农业水利工会第一次全国代表大会上作报告时提出了这个指标。
    李葆华说，目前全国正处在一个空前规模的以水利与积肥为中心的农业生产高潮之中，这个高潮比1955年冬到1956年春的生产高潮规模更大。根据到1月31日为止的初步统计，全国从去年10月份以来兴修的工程，可以扩大灌溉面积一亿一千七百八十九万亩，超过了1958年全年扩大灌溉面积九千二百二十一万亩的计划；在这同一时期，全国改善的灌溉面积和水土保持面积以及除涝面积也都在五千万亩到七千万亩以上。这些新扩大的灌溉面积，加上原有的灌溉面积，全国的灌溉总面积已经超过六亿亩，大体上平均每人有一亩水地。加上水土保持的成果，这一成就大大地增强了抗旱能力。就全国范围来说，已经基本解决了旱灾的威胁。农田水利建设工作的这些成就，也为今年农业生产大跃进打下了基础。
    李葆华说，全国在兴修水利高潮中取得的巨大成就，证明了开展群众性的修水利运动，是可以争取在三年内从根本上改变我国的干旱面貌的。他说，现在全国兴修水利的高潮还在发展，就从去年10月到目前为止的情况来看，已经扩大的灌溉面积就有一亿一千多万亩，那末全国大部地区再经过几个兴修水利高潮，全国灌溉面积就可以达到十亿多亩，这就可以基本实现水利化，就可以提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所提出的在十二年内基本上消灭普通水灾和旱灾的要求。
    李葆华在最后提出了完成第二个五年计划水利建设任务的具体方针。他说，今后水利建设工作必须贯彻防洪、除涝、灌溉、水土保持、发电、航运等相结合的综合治理和按河流集中治理的方针，必须贯彻“以蓄为主、以泄为辅”“小型为主、中型为辅、同时建立必要的可能的大型工程”的方针。
