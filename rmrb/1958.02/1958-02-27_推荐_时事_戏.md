    Recommending "Current Events" Plays
    Cao Yu
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre has staged four satirical comedies on current events against the rightists.

    These four plays are: "Oh Dear! The American Little Moon" by Chen Baichen, Liu Canglang, Wang Mingfu, and Huang Ti (Directors: Ouyang Shanzun, Lin Jing), "Higher Garbage" by Liu Canglang (Director: Bai Sen), "Huang Tan Visits Prison" by Fang Cheng (Director: Mei Qian), and "Fighting Sunday" by Chen Zhongxuan (Director: Ouyang Shanzun).

    These are four short plays that have deeply won the hearts of the people. They are said to have "deeply won the hearts of the people" because these four plays express what we want to say in our hearts. Some of them make a huge voice against the "Cold War" and call for peace, and some of them strongly express the high-spirited fighting will of the revolutionary masses of China today.

    Last year, the rightists wanted to restore capitalism, and we wanted to defend socialism. They attacked, we counterattacked, and the people finally victoriously encircled and suppressed these "higher garbage," demons and monsters, and even the "Huang" and "Tan" who "visited prison" and the right-wing reporter who stirred up trouble, like in "Fighting Sunday," were all wiped out.

    This great victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, and the infinitely radiant Soviet science, the two socialist "moons" going to heaven, are equally great contributions to the socialist cause of mankind.

    The anti-rightist struggle is a great socialist revolution on the domestic political and ideological fronts, and it is a huge theme.

    At the same time, today the East wind prevails over the West wind, and American imperialists are on the road to sunset, which shows that the role of "reactionaries" has also failed on the world stage, which is an even more important theme.

    In addition to the huge themes of socialist construction, the masses urgently need writers to reflect on such equally important issues. These four satirical comedies and some recent excellent anti-rightist scripts are sharp spears that pierce the hearts of these Chinese and foreign reactionaries.

    Saying that these four plays are well written, of course, not only refers to the authors' use of such timely themes. Everyone says that the scripts and performances are lively and novel and can attract people. Each short play is a vivid picture with bright colors and a brisk rhythm. They have one thing in common: they all burn with ardent political feelings, love what the masses love, and hate what the masses hate. They distinguish between love and hate from the people's eyes, so they have won the joy of so many masses.

    I especially like "Oh Dear! The American Little Moon" and "Higher Garbage." It should be said that these are two fairly complete satirical comedies. It can be seen that the authors have very rich materials, and their ability to select and use materials is indeed brilliant.

    "Oh Dear! The American Little Moon" is a brave attempt.

    Originally, "political commentary" content and "drama" form are rarely integrated together, and there is generally a sense of separation between the two. However, under the author's ingenious pen, this political commentary theme has become a sharp, unique satirical comedy. Its importance lies not only in the fact that it is a dramatic weapon that charges into battle, but also in the fact that it continues the glorious tradition of our country's playwrights in adopting rapid and strong means to reflect the current reality and current events for the revolutionary struggle for many years.

    Today, it is a great thing that our playwrights directly serve politics, promote politics straightforwardly, and write successful scripts with "current events" as the theme.

    Thanks to Chen Baichen, this sharp hand, an experienced expert, look how vividly he exposes the negative characters on the world stage, and how thoroughly he analyzes the unspeakable thoughts of these warmongers: Eisenhower, Dulles, and McElroy are lifelike in his writing. He exaggerates, but he makes people believe it. He and his talented collaborators—Liu Canglang, Wang Mingfu, and Huang Ti—have created a group of hateful, hateful, despicable, and ridiculous characters!

    The artistic forms on the stage should be ever-changing and diverse, but the political emotions conveyed to the audience cannot be blurred in the slightest. The authors have achieved these two points.

    "Oh Dear! The American Little Moon" is a demon-revealing mirror. These four authors clearly portray the embarrassing psychology of the American warmongers who are in a dilemma. They clearly tell the audience that the key to the failure of the American rulers does not lie in whether they can launch artificial satellites, but in their capitalist system, which makes American technology completely lag behind today's socialist era. A few days ago, the United States finally sent their "small" satellite into the sky, which was originally expected by the authors and people, and is not surprising. However, as the play points out, failure is failure, and American science and technology are definitely behind the Soviet Union (today I read in the newspaper that the United States' third launch of the "Vanguard" rocket has failed again!), which is an irreversible fact for the American warmongers.

    "It's too late, can't catch up with the Russians!" (Eisenhower in the play) This fatal failure in speed makes the four-star generals in the White House only have the share of being dejected. The author releases a heart-wrenching arrow, whether the American little moon is launched or not, the world has reached a new turning point: the United States is on the decline, and the "Russians" have caught up.

    The scene after Eisenhower and Dulles failed to launch the Little Moon is very brilliant. It speaks of the greatest distress of American imperialists: they have neither the "strength" to conquer the world nor are they willing to coexist peacefully with socialist countries. Eisenhower sighed and said, "We can't fight, we can't make peace, God, how did the United States get to this point!"

    Today, the "inner monologue" of American imperialists is exactly like this.

    In the end: that typical American product, a little swindler who specializes in doing business of informing, sells them the most secret secret again. This secret is: the spy who destroyed the "American Little Moon"—the symbol of American scientific development—is none other than the President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense, the three war-mongers kept by the American monopoly bourgeoisie! This ending is unexpected, but in people's minds, it is indeed well thought out.

    Liu Canglang's "Higher Garbage" writes a leading figure of the rightists quite well. This person "Zang Dongxi" is based on something, but everyone understands that this "Zang Dongxi" also summarizes all these double-dealers, the dregs of the new society, the "dirty things" that everyone should punish. The arrangement of the plot is appropriate. But I love the positive characters in the author's pen even more, the "barber" who represents the working people. It is a commendable thing that such a believable positive character appears in the satirical comedy and that the equally standing "Zang Dongxi" can be contrasted. This play develops quickly, has strong logic, and is a powerful satirical comedy.

    The author of "Huang Tan Visits Prison" is the satirical painter Fang Cheng. His writing is the same as his painting, both laughing, scolding, and becoming articles. The stage treatment is also in line with the author's intention, tightly connected, and well-matched. With the sound of gongs and drums, Huang Tan jumped out, stylizing and proceduralizing the die-hard and reactionary descendants of secret agents, murderers, and Huang Shiren together. The techniques of the author and stage artists are quite neat and clean.

    Chen Zhongxuan's "Fighting Sunday" writes about the children of New China in the anti-rightist movement. The children like to watch it very much, and the adults also watch it with relish. After watching the play, someone said, "Such a next generation! It is very reassuring to hand over the cause of the motherland to them." It must be pointed out that many adult actors play children in this play, but they perform with emotion and are quite similar. It is said that except for the young actor Chen Xiaoping, the average age of the other actors who play children is 27 years old, and they are already the parents of twenty children. It is a good phenomenon that adult actors are enthusiastic about performing children's plays, and larger theaters often arrange children's plays, which should be promoted.

    These several satirical comedies against the rightists have a common shortcoming, which lies in how the authors estimate the protagonists in the play—the rightists who are satirized—and how to deal with their problems.

    The rightists' countercurrent against socialism is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, and it does have a despicable and ridiculous side, but merely describing these is not enough to complete their faces. In that way, it gives us the feeling that it is like finishing drawing a person and forgetting to draw the eyes, not drawing the most important thing. The authors somewhat ignored the sinister and vicious side of the rightists, and unconsciously emphasized the ridiculous side, which easily makes people forget in the laughter the fatal danger of the rightists in the kind of "either you die or I live" struggle with us. And reminding the masses and making the people always maintain vigilance is precisely the educational effect that we should first obtain in the play.

    Everyone knows that if the rightists' attempt to subvert the Communist Party is realized, millions of people will lose their heads, and the people will fall into the darkness of reactionary rule again. Today, writing about the rightists, if they are only written as a pile of despicable and ridiculous bugs that can be swept away effortlessly, then it can still be said that the truth has not been completely written. Writing satirical dramas about current events is a heartwarming thing. But to penetrate people's hearts, it must hit the key. In the anti-rightist plays, the ferocity and viciousness of the rightists must be written in order to outline their main contours.

    In satirical dramas, making people laugh is very important. Everyone also welcomes the description of the rightists' stupidity, ignorance, vulgarity, hypocrisy, and the ridiculous aspects of their lives. But everyone prefers to deepen their understanding of things after laughing. The art of making people laugh is indeed much more difficult than the art of making people moved, but the art of making people think after laughing is even more difficult. The mayor satirized by Gogol in "The Government Inspector" is a model we should learn from when describing satirical objects. The mayor's stupidity and meanness are naturally written to the fullest extent, extremely ridiculous. But the most unforgettable thing is the mayor's ruthlessness and ferocity. The impression he gives is: the poison he releases can almost corrode the entire society of the Tsarist era (naturally, he is actually a product of that society); anything beautiful in the world will be destroyed when it encounters him and will wither immediately. Gogol's art makes people feel that the mayor's bone-deep malice is hidden in his seemingly very ridiculous words and deeds. Further requirements based on this point, the central characters of these plays ("Higher Garbage"'s Zang Dongxi, also feels unsatisfying at this point) still give us a feeling of being incomplete and not deep enough.

    I recommend these four plays because they are loud horns, telling us that art should be closely combined with politics. In the history of modern Chinese drama, there is a long history of reflecting revolutionary reality with diverse dramatic forms, thereby promoting the tradition of reality. During the 25,000-mile Long March and the long years of resistance against Japan, many works emerged that closely combined political tasks and art. These works have content and art, and their role in the era is as clear as the sun and the moon (who can forget "Put Down Your Whip" and "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland"! ), the people will always remember them.

    Writing short plays about current events, reflecting the problems that need to be solved urgently in the current society in a timely manner, naturally needs to be written well, but it should be reflected more quickly. The words "catch up with the task" seem to be outdated, and imply that since it is "catching up", it will not be written well. Some people even say that things written by "catching up with the task" are destined to be shallow. This concept is arbitrary and needs to be changed. It is said that "Oh Dear! The American Little Moon" only took one week from scratch, and they also did a lot of other things at the same time. It can be seen that writers (naturally, there are other prerequisites), if they usually care about politics, have a lot of materials on hand, have broad knowledge, and have strong judgment, their work can be done to a certain extent "more, faster, better, and more economical."

    The key is probably first in political enthusiasm. When writing articles, the bad atmosphere, such as today's "waste" and "conservative ideology", should be turned into a sea of flames on paper, burning fiercely and cleanly. For the positive atmosphere that should be greatly cultivated, such as "building the country with diligence and thrift", "more, faster, better, and more economical", and "cadres being sent to lower levels", the pen should be a drizzle and wind, moisturizing people's hearts, and urging people to muster up energy and strive for the upstream.

    I agree with the words satirical comedy on current events put forward in the advertisements of these four short plays. The word "current events" says bluntly that it is reasonable and well-founded for dramas to write about current events. Throughout the ages, in order to reform reality, writing current events dramas, from Aristophanes to Mayakovsky, there have been countless brilliant precedents. In our operas (such as Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" and local operas "Yang Naiwu and Xiaobaicai", etc.), as well as in the creations of the predecessors of spoken drama, Ouyang Yuqian, Tian Han, Xia Yan, Lao She, Yang Hansheng, Chen Baichen, etc., there are countless good works with enthusiastic, lively, and timely exert powerful political functions.

    I really hope that the road of this "current events" play can inspire more writers and start writing.

    Current events dramas can be long or short, can be eulogized, can be satirical, can be written as comedies, or written as farces, and can also adopt other various different and expedient forms. It can use real people and real events, but it does not necessarily have to be real people and real events. It can be ever-changing according to the time and place; those who are good at using it can appreciate its wonderfulness. It only has one requirement, which is speed and timeliness.

    Naturally, the speed of reflection is its advantage, but it also contains shortcomings.

    To write quickly, authors are often not allowed to chew the materials carefully, so it is difficult to deeply excavate the theme and the ideological content caused by current events. But the biggest limitation of current events dramas is probably in the portrayal of characters. The author cannot observe and ponder his characters for a long time, and in a hurry, he can easily write them sketchy and simple. Some people say that the characters in current events dramas are often just a good and bad mask. Comparing features and short stories, features are often written as soon as possible according to current needs, and the characters they describe may not be written as perfectly as the characters in short stories. But this is not entirely the case. Polevoy's feature characters are vivid and real, giving people a complete impression.

    Therefore, the characters in current events dramas are not destined to be simple and sketchy. Naturally, for those who are usually indifferent to current events and forcibly put together writing when they are in a hurry, "the characters in current events dramas are prone to be masked" becomes an absolute truth. But if the author has always been familiar with his characters, his characters can certainly be written vividly and deeply, even in current events dramas.

    Secondly, we still lack experience in writing current events dramas. There are still very few exemplary works that reflect the booming socialist construction and world politics in the form of current events dramas. This makes our writing of this type of genre particularly difficult. But this is an extremely convenient weapon that is urgently needed by the masses. Like an instant effect, it can quickly and directly serve politics. As long as we write often, write more, accumulate experience, and become proficient in writing, we will definitely produce good current events plays that both exert timely political functions and stand the test of time.

    This spring is very different. Everyone is ambitious and high-spirited. A revolutionary spirit is surging in everyone's actions. Everything is developing in a more beautiful and richer socialist direction.

    To paint the appearance of this glorious and splendid great era, we should add the sharp new pen of current events dramas!　February 6, 1958

    推荐“时事”戏
    曹禺
    北京人民艺术剧院上演了四出反右的时事讽刺喜剧。
    这四出戏是：陈白尘、刘沧浪、王命夫、黄悌的“哎呀呀！美国小月亮”（导演：欧阳山尊、林婧），刘沧浪的“高等垃圾”（导演：柏森），方成的“黄谭探监”（导演：梅阡），陈中宣的“战斗的星期天”（导演：欧阳山尊）。
    这是四个深得人心的短戏。说它们“深得人心”，是因为这四出戏说出了我们心中要说的话。它们有的发出反对“冷战”、呼吁和平的巨大声音，有的强烈地表现了今天中国革命群众的昂扬斗志。
    去年，右派分子们要复辟资本主义，我们要保卫社会主义。他们攻，我们反攻，人民终于胜利地围剿了这些“高等垃圾”，妖魔鬼怪，连“探监”的“黄”、“谭”和那兴风作浪，像在“战斗的星期天”里面的右派记者，也一概打灭干净。
    这个整风、反右斗争的伟大胜利，和光芒万丈的苏联科学，社会主义的两个“月亮”上了天，同样都是人类对社会主义事业的极大贡献。
    反右斗争是国内政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义大革命，是一个巨大的主题。
    与此同时，今天东风压倒西风，美帝国主义者走上了日薄西山的道路，说明“反动派”这个角色在世界舞台上，也遭到失败，更是一个重要的题材。
    群众迫切需要作家们在写社会主义建设的巨大题材之外，也反映这类同等重要的问题。这四个讽刺喜剧和最近一些优秀的反右剧本，便是一只一只的锐利的戈矛，刺中了这些中外反动派的心窝。
    说这四个戏写得好，当然不仅是指作者们运用了这样适时的题材。大家说，这些剧本和演出的形式都生动、新颖，能吸引人。每一个短剧都是一副色彩鲜明、节奏明快的活生生的图画。它们有一个共同点，都燃烧着炽烈的政治情感，爱群众之所爱，恨群众之所恨。从人民的眼里，分清爱憎，因此博得这样多群众的欢喜。
    我特别喜欢“哎呀呀！美国小月亮”和“高等垃圾”，应该说，这是两本相当完整的讽刺喜剧。看得出，作者笔下的材料非常丰富，他们选择、运用材料的本领也确实高明。
    “哎呀呀！美国小月亮”是一个勇敢的尝试。
    本来，“政论”内容和“戏剧”形式难得揉合在一起，二者之间，一般说是有些阻隔之感的。但在作者的生花妙笔下，这篇政论性的题材，成了一本尖锐锋利、别具一格的讽刺喜剧。它的重要还不只在于它是一个冲锋陷阵的戏剧武器，而更在于它继续了我国剧作家多年为了革命斗争，对当前现实，对时事，采取迅速、强烈的手段来反映的光荣传统。
    今天我们剧作家为直接服务于政治，单刀直入地宣传政治，写出了以“时事”为题材的成功的剧本，这是大可以高兴的事。
    感谢陈白尘，这个尖锐的手笔，老练的行家，你看他把世界舞台上的反面人物揭露得多么活，把这些好战分子不敢告人的思想剖析得多么透：艾森豪威尔，杜勒斯，麦克艾罗伊在他笔下是活灵活现的。他夸张，但他叫人相信。他和他的有才能的合作者们——刘沧浪、王命夫、黄悌——塑造出一群多么可厌、可憎、可鄙、可笑的人物！
    舞台上的艺术形式要千变万化，多种多样，但政治的情感，传达给观众，却一丝一毫不能模糊。这两点，作者们是做到了的。
    “哎呀呀！美国小月亮”是一面照妖镜。这四位作者，把美国的好战分子进退两难的尴尬心理刻划明白。他们明明确确地告诉观众，美国统治者失败的关键并不在于他们是否能放射出人造卫星，而是在他们的资本主义制度，把美国的技术科学弄得完全落在今天社会主义的时代的后面。前两天，美国终于把他们的那个“小”卫星送上天空，这原在作者和人们的意料中的，无足为奇。然而正如剧中指出，失败就是失败，美国的科学技术肯定的落在苏联后面（今天看报，美国放射“先锋号”火箭第三次又失败了！），是美国好战分子们无可挽回的事实。
    “迟了，赶不上俄国人了！”（剧中艾森豪威尔语）这个致命的速度上的失败，使白宫里的四星将军们，也只有垂头丧气的分儿。作者放出一支椎心的利箭，无论美国的小月亮放得出去与否，世界走上了新的转捩点：美国走上了下坡路，“俄国人”赶到前面去了。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在小月亮放射失败以后的那一场戏是很精采的，它说出了美帝国主义者的最大苦闷：既无征服世界的“实力”，又不愿与社会主义国家和平共处。唉声叹气的艾森豪威尔说道：“战不能战，和不能和，上帝啊，美国怎么落到这步田地！”
    今天，美帝国主义者的“内心独白”正是这样。
    结尾：那个典型的美国产物，专做告密生意的小骗子又卖给他们一个最秘密的秘密。这个秘密是：破坏“美国小月亮”——美国科学发展的象征——的间谍不是别人，却正是总统、国务卿、国防部长这三个为美国垄断资产阶级所豢养的战争贩子！这个结尾出人意外，却又在人意中，确实想得好。
    刘沧浪的“高等垃圾”，把一个右派分子头面人物写得相当好。“臧东曦”这个人是有所依据的，却谁都明白这个“臧东曦”又概括了所有这些两面派，新社会的渣子，人人得而诛之的“脏东西”。情节的安排是恰当的。但我更爱作者笔下的正面人物，那个代表劳动人民的“理发师”。讽刺喜剧里出现这样一个令人相信的正面人物，和那同样站得住的“臧东曦”，能够对衬起来，是一件难能可贵的事情。这个戏发展得快，逻辑性强，是一本有力的讽刺喜剧。
    “黄谭探监”的作者是讽刺画家方成。他的文笔和画笔一样，都是嘻笑怒骂，皆成文章。演出上的处理也和作者的企图合拍，接得紧，扣得上。锣鼓一声响，黄谭跳出来，把特务、杀人犯、和黄世仁的死硬、反动的后代，一起风格化、程式化，作者和舞台艺术家们的手法是相当干净利落的。
    陈中宣的“战斗的星期天”，写出了反右运动中的新中国的儿童。孩子们很欢喜看，大人们也看得津津有味。看完了戏，有人讲：“这样的下一代！把祖国的事业交给他们，是非常放心的。”须指出，这个戏里有许多成年演员扮演小孩，却演得有情感，相当像。据说除小演员陈小平外，其余扮孩子的演员平均年龄二十七岁，他们已是二十个孩子的父母了。成年演员热心演儿童剧，大一点的剧院常排儿童剧，是一个应该提倡的好现象。
    这几个反右的讽刺喜剧有一个共同的缺点，便在作者如何估计剧中主人翁——被讽刺的右派分子们及如何处理他们的问题上。
    右派分子们反社会主义的逆行正像螳臂挡车，确有可鄙可笑的一面，但仅仅把这些描写了，他们的面目便不够完全。那样，给我们的感觉就像画完了一个人，忘记画眼睛，没有画出最主要的东西。作者有些忽略右派分子狠毒险恶的那一面，不知不觉地偏重了可笑的那一面，容易使人们在笑声中，忘记了右派分子们在和我们那种“你死我活”的斗争里的致命的危险性。而提醒群众，使人民永远保持着警惕，正是我们在剧里首先应该得到的教育效果。
    谁都知道，右派分子想颠覆共产党的企图如果实现，便是千百万人头落了地，人民又将堕入反动统治的黑暗里。今天写右派分子，若把他们仅仅写成是一堆可鄙可笑的臭虫，可以毫不费力地一扫而光，那么，仍可以说是还没有完完全全地写出了真实。写时事讽刺剧是一件得人心的事。但要深入人心，就必须击中要害。在反右的戏里，就必须写出右派分子的凶恶险毒，才勾勒得出他们的主要轮廓。
    在讽刺剧里，令人笑是很重要的。大家也是欢迎描写右派分子们的愚蠢无知、庸俗虚伪以及生活上那些可笑的地方的。但是大家更喜欢笑了之后，却加深了对事物的认识。使人笑的艺术确实比使人感动的艺术难多了，但笑完了还能使人思索的艺术是更难的。果戈里在“巡按”里所讽刺的市长是我们在描写讽刺的对象时应该学习的典范。市长的愚蠢卑鄙自然写得淋离尽致，可笑之极。但最使人忘记不了的，还是这个市长的狠辣、凶恶。他给人的印象是：他放出的毒害，几乎可以腐蚀整个帝俄时代的社会（自然，实际上他也是那个社会的产物）；世上任何美好的东西，遇见了他，便会遭到毁灭，登时枯萎。果戈里的艺术使人感到市长的刻骨的毒恶就藏在他那表面上非常可笑的言行里。从这一点进一步的要求，这几个戏的中心人物（“高等垃圾”的臧东曦，在这一点上也令人感到不够满足）仍然给我们一种不够完全，不够深刻之感。
    推荐这四个戏，因为它们是嘹亮的号角，告诉我们艺术应该紧密地结合政治。中国的现代戏剧史里，以多种多样的戏剧形式，反映革命现实，从而推动现实的传统，是有悠久历史的。二万五千里长征，和长期的抗日岁月里，出现了多少把政治任务和艺术紧密结合的作品。这些作品有内容，有艺术，它们在时代中起的作用，昭若日月，（谁能忘记“放下你的鞭子”和“兄妹开荒”！），人民是永远记得的。
    写关于时事的短戏，及时反映当前社会迫待解决的问题，自然要写得好，但更应该反映得快。“赶任务”这三个字仿佛过了时，而且含着既然“赶”，便会写不好的意思。有人甚至于说“赶任务”写出的东西就定然浅薄，这种观念是武断的，须要改变一下。“哎呀呀！美国小月亮”据说从无到有仅用了一个星期，而他们同时还做了其它不少的事情。可见作家（自然，还有其他先决条件），如果平时是关心政治的，手下材料多，知识广，判断力强，他的工作便可以做到在一定程度上“又多，又快，又好”。
    关键恐怕首先在政治热情。写出文章来，对那坏的风气，譬如今天的“浪费”，“保守思想”，就要纸上腾起一片火焰，炽猛地烧个干净。对那正面的，应大大加以培养的气象，譬如“勤俭建国”，“多、快、好、省”，“干部下放”等，笔下就是一片细雨和风，浸润人心，催动人们鼓起干劲，力争上游的心情。
    我赞同这四个短戏的广告上提出时事讽刺喜剧的字样。“时事”二字，开门见山，说出戏剧写时事，是合情合理，有根有据的。古往今来，为了改革现实，写时事剧，从阿里斯多芬到马雅可夫斯基，有无数光辉的先例。我们的戏曲（如昆曲“十五贯”和地方戏曲“杨乃武和小白菜”等），以及话剧前辈欧阳予倩、田汉、夏衍、老舍、阳翰笙、陈白尘等的创作里，就有举不胜举的热情洋溢，生动活泼，及时发挥强有力的政治作用的好作品。
    真希望这个“时事”戏的道路能够引起更多作家们的灵感，动起笔来。
    时事剧可长可短，可以讴歌，可以讽刺，可以写成喜剧，或写成闹剧，还可以采取其它种种不同、便宜行事的形式。它可以用真人真事，但也不一定要真人真事。它可以因时因地，千变万化；善于运用的人就能体会它的妙处。它仅有一个要求，便是迅速及时。
    自然，反映的迅速是它的好处，但也含着缺点。
    要写的快，往往不允许作者对材料细嚼烂咽，因而对主题，对从时事引起的思想内容，难于挖掘得深透。但时事剧最大的局限性，恐怕是在人物的刻画上。作者对他的人物不能长久的观察揣摩，在仓促命笔中，容易把他们写的潦草简单。有人说，时事戏中的人物，往往仅是一个好与坏的脸谱。以特写和短篇小说做比，特写常是应当前需要，尽快写成的，它所描写的人物，可能不如短篇小说的人物写的完美些。但这也不完全如此，波列伏依的特写人物，便生动真实，使人得到完整的印象。
    因此，时事戏中的人物并非命定就是简单的，潦草的。自然，遇见那些平时对当前的事变无动于衷，急来便生拉活扯地硬凑来写作的人，“时事戏中的人物容易脸谱化”，便成了绝对的道理。但如果作者对他的人物一直是熟悉的，他的人物，即便在时事戏里，也必然可以写得活生生的，有深度的。
    其次，写时事戏我们还缺乏经验。以时事戏的形式来反映如火如荼的社会主义建设和世界政治的典范作品还很少。这使我们这类体裁的写作，便感到特别的困难。但这是一种极便利，又为群众迫切需要的武器。如立竿见影，它能迅速地直接服务于政治。只要我们常写，多写，累积经验，写熟了，定然会产生既发挥及时的政治作用，又经得住久看的好的时事戏。
    今年春天大不同，人人雄心勃勃，意气扬扬，一股革命干劲，奔腾在每个人的行动里，一切都向更美好更丰富的社会主义方向发展。
    画出今天这光辉灿烂的伟大时代的风貌，应该添加时事戏这一支锋利的新笔！　于1958.2.6
