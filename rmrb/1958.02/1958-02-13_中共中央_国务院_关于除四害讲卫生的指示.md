Instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council
On Eliminating the Four Pests and Promoting Hygiene
(February 12, 1958)

Summary of Instructions:

    A high tide of patriotic hygiene movement centered on eliminating the four pests has formed across the country. Currently, the Party and the government must firmly and actively lead this movement, developing it throughout all areas that have basically achieved socialist ownership transformation during the spring and summer of this year, truly achieving a level where every household knows about it and everyone participates.

    Eliminating flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows is an important step in our conquest of diseases and elimination of pests, harmful animals, and harmful birds that endanger humans. We must not only conquer human diseases but also conquer diseases, pests, and animal damage affecting livestock, poultry, and crops. This struggle is an important aspect of humanity's great war to conquer nature and transform nature, and an important aspect of our country's great cultural revolution to transform weakness into strength, and backwardness into advancement.

    The requirements for eliminating rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes, and for basically eliminating the most serious diseases harming the people, can not only be achieved within ten years but are also entirely possible to achieve ahead of schedule.

    The movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene must be combined with urban and rural production. It must combine the strength of the masses with technical strength, and combine surprise attacks with regular work. 1958 is the first year of the nationwide march towards the four pests and diseases, and this year's surprise activities will inevitably take more time than usual. The work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene in each grassroots unit should be inspected once a week, each larger unit should be inspected and evaluated once a month, and a major inspection and overall evaluation should be conducted at the end of the year. The First Secretary of the local Party organization must personally take charge of this movement, grasping planning, grasping propaganda, grasping inspection and evaluation, and promoting the administrative heads of each unit to do the same.

    A high tide of patriotic hygiene movement centered on eliminating the four pests has formed across the country. In provinces and cities across the country, the broad masses are mobilizing on a large scale to eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes, promote hygiene, eradicate the diseases most seriously harming the local people, and have proposed plans to achieve the requirements set forth in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule within a few years. As of now, according to incomplete statistics, the provinces and directly administered municipalities that have set dates to achieve "four-free" status ahead of schedule include Beijing, set at two years; Henan, set at three years; Shanghai, set at three to five years; Jiangsu, set at four years; Shandong, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Gansu, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, set at five years; and Anhui, set at five to eight years. Cities and counties that have decided to achieve "four-free" status within this year include Nanjing, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nantong in Jiangsu; Jinan, Yangxin, and Shanxian in Shandong; Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Jiaozuo, and Dengfeng in Henan; Lanzhou in Gansu; Tunliu in Shanxi; and Lixian and Hejian in Hebei. Cadres and the masses are full of enthusiasm and confidence in this movement, and the movement is making new progress every day. Currently, the urgent task of the Party and the government is to firmly and actively lead this movement, developing it throughout all areas that have basically achieved socialist ownership transformation during the spring and summer of this year, truly achieving a level where every household knows about it and everyone participates. This spring, every province, city, autonomous region, every county, district, every township, every cooperative, factory, mine, enterprise, institution, school, and army unit must formulate its own annual and long-term plans for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, and must strive to lay a solid foundation for achieving long-term plans within this year.

    The fundamental requirements for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, as stated in the National Agricultural Development Program, are to achieve the goals of eliminating disease, inspiring everyone, changing customs and habits, and transforming the country. Since the dawn of humanity, people have been threatened by diseases and various pests, harmful animals, and harmful birds. Our people have created a wealth of experience in the long struggle against disease, but only after the victory of the socialist revolution can we mobilize together under the leadership of the Party and the government, and fight to eliminate disease in a planned and organized manner. Eliminating disease and protecting the lives and health of the people is to protect the most important wealth and the most important productive force in the world. For this purpose, we must pay attention to environmental hygiene and personal hygiene, we must prevent the occurrence of diseases and stop the spread of diseases. Flies transmit dysentery, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and polio. Mosquitoes transmit malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and filariasis. Rats transmit plague, schistosomiasis, leptospirosis, tsutsugamushi disease, murine typhus, and rat-bite fever. To protect the health of the people, we must eliminate flies, mosquitoes, and rats. In addition to spreading disease, rats also consume a large amount of grain and damage clothing, houses, and field embankments and dikes. Like rats, sparrows are also a major enemy of crops. Eliminating flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows is an important step in our conquest of diseases and elimination of pests, harmful animals, and harmful birds that endanger humans. In the process of this struggle, we will greatly improve the people's level of hygiene and health, gradually control the spread and occurrence of the most harmful diseases in various regions and occupations, and enable the broad masses to increase their confidence and courage in controlling the natural environment, in order to further conquer all diseases and eliminate all pests, harmful animals, and harmful birds. We must not only conquer human diseases but also conquer diseases, pests, and animal damage affecting livestock, poultry, and crops. This struggle is an important aspect of humanity's great war to conquer nature and transform nature, and an important aspect of our country's great cultural revolution to transform weakness into strength, and backwardness into advancement, which is closely related to improving labor efficiency, developing the industrial and agricultural economy, and improving the people's living standards. Any idea that ignores the significance of this struggle, considering it an unimportant trivial matter, is wrong.

    The main obstacles to eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, in addition to the aforementioned idea that this is a trivial matter, is "making a fuss about nothing," is that many people are afraid of the difficulties in this struggle and do not believe that the four pests and many unhygienic habits can be eliminated. However, the experience of the patriotic hygiene movement since 1952, especially the experience of the large-scale winter elimination of the four pests and promotion of hygiene movement recently launched in various places, fully demonstrates the bankruptcy of this skepticism. Facts have proven that as long as the local Communist Party members and government workers can truly lead the masses with revolutionary spirit, the local movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene can develop rapidly, and the local environmental hygiene can be fundamentally improved in a very short period. It is particularly worth pointing out that many advanced areas in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene are not institutions and schools with better sanitation equipment, but precisely places where working people with more difficult living conditions live, and even remote and poor mountainous areas. The achievements of these areas are mainly due not to the fact that the government and cooperatives spent a lot of money, but to the determination, strength, and wisdom of the masses. Judging from the recent situation, the requirements for eliminating rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes, and for basically eliminating the most serious diseases harming the people, can not only be achieved within ten years but are also entirely possible to achieve ahead of schedule.

    In order to lead the patriotic hygiene movement centered on eliminating the four pests well, all localities should pay close attention to the following issues:

    (1) The movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene must be combined with urban and rural production, so that the movement directly serves production, and the plan to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene is placed within the overall production and construction plan.

    In rural areas, it must be combined with agricultural production. The problem of handling human and animal manure is of great importance to both hygiene and fertilizer accumulation and must be resolved first. It is necessary to universally ensure that everyone has a toilet, and to ensure that cattle and horses have stables, pigs and sheep have pens, and poultry have nests. In some places where humans and animals live together, human and animal separation should be gradually implemented. Toilets should have sheds, and manure buckets, manure tanks, and manure pits should be covered. Livestock pens should be padded with soil frequently, manure should be removed frequently, and they should be cleaned frequently. It is necessary to frequently dredge ditches, repair potholes, drain sewage, remove weeds, sweep up garbage, collect manure, and vigorously promote the method of sealing compost with mud. The work of digging pupae to eliminate maggots, preventing flies and eliminating flies, tidying up toilets, managing manure, cleaning courtyards, and improving environmental hygiene should be combined with the work of increasing fertilizer, protecting and improving fertilizer efficiency, so that weeding and eliminating mosquitoes, dredging ditches and digging ponds to drain water and prevent larvae and eliminate snails, should be combined with composting green manure, building farmland water conservancy, diverting sewage to collect pond mud for fertilizer, and raising fish in ponds and ditches, to combine hygiene work with the work of developing agricultural production as much as possible.

    In cities, it must be combined with urban construction, industrial and commercial management, urban-rural mutual assistance, and school education. In order to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in cities, it is necessary to solve the problem of treating urban manure, garbage, and sewage, transforming, dredging, or filling unsanitary river ditches and potholes, and properly arranging and managing some of the industries that are most likely to attract flies and rats and are most likely to spread diseases (such as the processing industry of animal hair, feathers, skins, bones, blood, and meat, the candy and sauce manufacturing industry, tofu workshops, flour mills, the catering industry, the breeding industry, etc.). The treatment of urban manure, garbage, and sewage must serve the nearby agriculture as much as possible. A method of establishing long-term contracts between enterprises, institutions, schools and agricultural cooperatives can be adopted to actively develop cooperation between urban areas and nearby agricultural cooperatives in this regard. In all public activity places and public entertainment places, attention must be paid to cleanliness and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. In factories, mines, construction sites, and newly developed areas, in addition to paying attention to the treatment of manure, garbage, and sewage, and the elimination of mosquitoes, flies, and rats, special attention should also be paid to the management of food, the cleanliness of dormitories, the protection of workers' health, and the prevention of occupational diseases and frequently occurring diseases. Enterprises, institutions, and schools must not only accept the inspection and management of hygiene work by urban district and street organizations, but also should make full use of their favorable conditions to overcome the backward state of certain units and actively play a leading role in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. In schools, sanitation education should be strengthened, and the development of hygienic habits should be regarded as an aspect of moral conduct, and students' participation in the elimination of the four pests and promotion of hygiene activities both inside and outside the school should be regarded as a part of the overall labor education. Institutions and military units must also participate in urban voluntary labor to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

    (2) In the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, the strength of the masses must be combined with technical strength, and surprise attacks must be combined with regular work.

    Eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene must thoroughly rely on the strength of the masses, implement the mass line and the spirit of diligence and thrift in hygiene work, and oppose the erroneous view that promoting hygiene must cost a lot of money, purchase a lot of medicines and equipment, and mobilize a lot of experts. In order to fully mobilize the masses, it is necessary to mobilize the organizations of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation, mobilize all propaganda forces, and carry out vivid and powerful propaganda in response to the specific situation, the specific requirements at the time, and the specific ideological concerns existing among the masses. Various forms of propaganda, such as newspapers, magazines, broadcasting, slides, movies, big-character posters, propaganda posters, street propaganda, door-to-door propaganda, visits, exhibitions, mass meetings, resident group meetings, etc., should be used as much as possible. Basic common sense and advanced experience on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and preventing and treating diseases must be regularly and carefully introduced by newspapers and broadcasts, and must be compiled into brochures and picture pages and distributed to the grassroots in large quantities. Activists and advanced collectives in the masses who eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene should be commended and rewarded. Sparrows can be used as food, and to encourage the capture of sparrows, they can be purchased by the state.

    However, in order to make the mass movement quickly effective, technical strength must also catch up at the same time. This includes research on the living habits of the four pests and other organisms that endanger humans, research on the occurrence and epidemic patterns of serious local diseases, the dissemination of technical knowledge and experience in effectively eliminating the four pests and eliminating diseases, the formulation of specific plans (especially plans for eliminating serious local diseases), the introduction, production, and supply of drugs and equipment necessary for large-scale elimination of the four pests and elimination of diseases, and the training and allocation of necessary technical personnel. The current situation in many places is that the mass movement has risen, but technical guidance and scientific research are far behind, and this situation must be changed rapidly. All medical and health institutions and related scientific research institutions, health personnel, and Red Cross members should actively participate in the mass movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, and strive to strengthen their work, and strive to stand in front of the mass movement to promote the development of the movement.

    Because it is necessary to mobilize millions of people to change the habits accumulated over millions of years in a short period of time, because the masses are busy at different times, and the activities of the four pests and many disease vectors and germs have a certain seasonality, the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene must rely on certain surprise attacks. During the year, the time when the four pests begin to become active in early spring is a major battle, the time when infectious diseases are rampant in summer and autumn is a major battle, and winter is combined with accumulating fertilizer, repairing water conservancy, improving sanitary conditions, and eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies is another major battle. Holding a major cleaning in conjunction with the Spring Festival, May Day, and National Day is also a kind of surprise activity. In addition, due to time, place, and event, there will be surprise activities in conjunction with inspection and evaluation. 1958 is the first year of the nationwide march towards the four pests and diseases, and this year's surprise activities will inevitably take more time than usual. The work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene in each grassroots unit (such as a production team, a work section, a street) should be inspected once a week, each larger unit (such as a cooperative, a township, a factory in a city, a district) should be inspected and evaluated once a month, and a major inspection and overall evaluation should be conducted at the end of the year, in order to lay the foundation for the implementation of long-term plans.

    In the struggle to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, in addition to doing a good job in surprise activities to make the movement more in-depth and advanced step by step, each unit and each household must also formulate regular work plans, and try to make the work regular in order to supplement the shortcomings of the surprise activities and consolidate the results of the surprise activities. Each place should, in a planned and step-by-step manner, propose to the masses some universally achievable requirements related to environmental hygiene and personal hygiene according to the specific conditions at the time and place, and should gradually improve the Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committees at all levels, grassroots medical institutions, and mass hygiene organizations in urban and rural areas (Patriotic Hygiene Groups should be established in all enterprises, institutions, schools, military units, streets, and cooperatives), so that the sanitary conditions and sanitary work conditions of each household and each unit are regularly inspected, supervised, and guided, so that the sanitary work in various places can be improved every month and updated every year.

    (3) The key to the decision of the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene lies in the leadership of the Party. The First Secretary of the Party organizations at all levels must personally take charge of this movement, grasping planning, grasping propaganda, grasping inspection and evaluation, and promoting the administrative heads of each unit to do the same.

    The plans of each local unit must be suitable for the situation of the local unit. Which serious diseases are there in the local area, which are the main harmful insects, harmful birds and harmful animals that must be eliminated, how long will it take to eliminate each, how should the order be arranged, what forces and methods should be mainly relied on, and how should it be combined with production and construction work must be clear in mind when formulating the plan. The specific slogans proposed to the masses can be adapted to local conditions. For example, in areas with schistosomiasis, the elimination of the four pests should be added to the elimination of snails, in areas with kala-azar, the elimination of sandflies should be added, and in areas with bedbugs and fleas, the elimination of bedbugs and fleas should be added. In cities, promoting hygiene can include dissuading people from spitting everywhere, and in factories, the focus can be on preventing occupational diseases, etc. The work tasks need to be divided into several stages in a few years (for example, first focusing on eliminating the four pests, and then switching to eliminating important diseases), and different priorities should also be set at different times of the year (for example, when to concentrate on eliminating rats and when to concentrate on eliminating sparrows).

    The time to achieve the plan depends on the development of the mass movement. Those who are indeed in a position to achieve the plan ahead of schedule should strive to achieve it ahead of schedule, and the content of the plan can also be supplemented and revised year by year. Grasping both the advanced and backward ends and driving the middle is a good way to lead production, and it is also a good way to lead the elimination of the four pests and promote hygiene. All localities must be good at using these methods to vigorously disseminate the experience of advanced units, eliminate "dead ends" in the movement, and constantly bring the work of the entire region up to the level of advanced units.

    All provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and special districts must formulate their own annual and long-term plans for eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating important diseases in the first half of this year, and must conduct monthly and quarterly inspections and evaluations of the work of subordinate units and issue circulars in order to commend the advanced and urge the backward. Ten years depend on three years, and three years depend on the first year. As long as Party and government organizations at all levels are conscientious and responsible, act vigorously and decisively, and persist to the end, we will certainly be able to lay a solid foundation for this work within this year, eliminate the four pests in a few years, basically eliminate the most serious diseases harming the people, and greatly improve the sanitary conditions of the country.

    关于除四害讲卫生的指示
    （一九五八年二月十二日）
    指示内容提要
    一个以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的高潮已经在全国形成。目前党和政府要坚决地积极地领导这一运动，在今年春夏两季把这一运动发展到全国一切已经基本上实现了社会主义所有制改造的地方，真正达到家喻户晓、人人动手的程度。
    消灭苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀，是我们征服疾病和消灭危害人类的害虫害兽害鸟的一个重要步骤。我们不仅要征服人类的疾病，而且要征服家畜、家禽和作物的病害、虫害和兽害。这个斗争，是人类征服自然改造自然的伟大战争的一个重要方面，是我国人民转病弱为健强、转落后为先进的伟大文化革命的一个重要方面。
    消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子和基本上消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的要求，不但可以在十年内实现，而且完全可能提前实现。
    除四害讲卫生的运动必须同城乡生产相结合。必须使群众力量和技术力量相结合，使突击工作和经常工作相结合。1958年是全国向四害和疾病大进军的第一年，今年的突击活动必然要比平常花费较多的时间。各基层单位的除四害讲卫生工作，应该每星期检查一次，各较大单位，应该每月检查评比一次，年终应该大检查总评比一次。各地党组织的第一书记对于这一运动必须亲自动手，抓规划、抓宣传、抓检查评比，并且要推动各单位的行政负责人同样亲自动手。
    一个以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的高潮已经在全国形成。在全国各省市，广大群众正在大规模地行动起来，消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子，提倡卫生，扑灭危害当地人民最严重的疾病，并且纷纷提出规划，准备在几年时间内提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所提出的要求。截至目前为止，据不完全统计，提前实现“四无”的省和直属市，已经有北京定为两年，河南定为三年，上海定为三至五年，江苏定为四年，山东、山西、浙江、福建、广东、云南、甘肃、辽宁、黑龙江定为五年，安徽定为五至八年。决定在今年内就实现“四无”的市和县，有江苏的南京、常州、镇江、南通，山东的济南、阳信、单县，河南的郑州、开封、洛阳、焦作、登封，甘肃的兰州，山西的屯留，河北的蠡县、河间。干部和群众在这一运动中充满干劲和信心，运动每天都有新的进展。目前党和政府的迫切任务，就是要坚决地积极地领导这一运动，在今年春夏两季把这一运动发展到全国一切已经基本上实现了社会主义所有制改造的地方，真正达到家喻户晓、人人动手的程度。要在今年春季，使每一省、市、自治区，每一县区，每个乡镇，每个合作社、厂矿企业、机关、学校、部队，都订出自己除四害、讲卫生的年度计划和长期计划，而且务必在今年内打下实现长期计划的巩固基础。
    除四害、讲卫生的根本要求，如全国农业发展纲要所说，是要达到消灭疾病、人人振奋、移风易俗、改造国家的目的。自有人类以来，人们一直受着疾病和各种害虫害兽害鸟的威胁。我国人民在反对疾病的长期斗争中创造了丰富的经验，但是只有在社会主义革命胜利以后，才能够在党和政府的领导下一致动员起来，有计划有组织地为消灭疾病而斗争。消灭疾病，保卫人民的生命和健康，这就是保护世界上最重要的财富和最重要的生产力。为此目的，必须讲求环境卫生和个人卫生，必须预防疾病的发生，制止疾病的传播。苍蝇传播痢疾、伤寒、霍乱、肝炎、脊髓灰白质炎，蚊子传播疟疾、乙型脑炎、血丝虫病，老鼠传播鼠疫、血吸虫病、钩端螺旋体病、恙虫病、鼠型斑疹伤寒、鼠咬热。为了保卫人民的健康，必须消灭苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠。老鼠除了传播疾病以外，还大量损耗粮食，破坏衣物、房屋以及田埂堤坝。同老鼠一样，麻雀也是农作物的大敌。消灭苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀，是我们征服疾病和消灭危害人类的害虫害兽害鸟的一个重要步骤。在这一斗争的过程中，我们要大大提高人民的卫生水平和健康水平，逐步控制在各个地区、各种职业中为害最烈的疾病的蔓延和发生，使广大群众对于控制自然环境增加信心和勇气，以便进而征服一切疾病，消灭一切害虫害兽害鸟。我们不但要征服人类的疾病，而且要征服家畜、家禽和作物的病害、虫害和兽害。这个斗争，是人类征服自然改造自然的伟大战争的一个重要方面，是我国人民转病弱为健强、转落后为先进的伟大文化革命的一个重要方面，对于提高劳动效率、发展工农业经济、改善人民生活有密切的关系。任何忽视这一斗争的意义、认为是无关重要的小事的想法都是错误的。
    除四害讲卫生的主要障碍，除了上述认为这是小事，是“小题大做”的想法以外，就是许多人害怕这一斗争中的困难，不相信四害和许多不卫生的习惯能够除掉。但是1952年以后的爱国卫生运动的经验，特别是最近时期各地大规模展开的冬季除四害讲卫生运动的经验，充分说明了这种怀疑论的破产。事实证明，只要那里的共产党员和政府工作人员能够真正用革命精神把群众领导起来，就能够使那里的除四害讲卫生运动得到迅速的发展，并且在很短期间根本改善当地的环境卫生。值得特别指出的是，很多除四害讲卫生的先进地区，并不是卫生设备较好的机关学校，而恰恰是生活条件比较困难的劳动人民聚居的地方，甚至是偏僻贫苦的山区。这些地区成绩的获得，主要也不是由于政府和合作社花了很多钱，而是由于群众的决心、力量和智慧。从最近时期的情况看来，消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子和基本上消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的要求，不但可以在十年内实现，而且完全可能提前实现。
    为了领导好以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，各地应当切实注意以下几个问题：
    （一）除四害讲卫生的运动必须同城乡生产相结合，使运动直接为生产服务，并且把除四害讲卫生的计划放在总的生产建设的计划之内。
    在农村，要同农业生产结合起来。人畜粪便的处理问题对于卫生和积肥都关系重大，必须首先解决。要在全国普遍做到人有厕所，并且做到牛马有栏，猪羊有圈，家禽有窝。在某些人畜同居的地方，要有步骤地实现人畜分居。厕所要加棚，粪桶粪缸粪池要加盖。牲畜栏圈，要勤垫土，勤起粪，勤打扫。要经常疏通沟渠，修整坑洼，排导污水，铲除杂草，打扫垃圾，收集粪便，大力推广泥封堆肥办法。要使挖蛹灭蛆、防蝇灭蝇、整理厕所、管理粪便、打扫庭院、改善环境卫生的工作同增加肥料、保护和提高肥效的工作结合进行，使除草灭蚊、疏沟挖塘排水防孑孓灭钉螺的工作，同沤压绿肥、兴修农田水利、引污水取塘泥肥田、水塘水沟养鱼的工作结合进行，尽可能地把卫生工作和发展农业生产的工作合而为一。
    在城市，要同市政建设、工商业管理、城乡互助和学校教育结合起来。为了在城市除四害讲卫生，必须解决城市的粪便、垃圾、污水的处理，改造、疏浚或者填垫不清洁的河沟坑洼，妥善安置和管理一些最容易吸引苍蝇老鼠和最容易传染疾病的行业（例如动物毛羽皮骨血肉的加工业、糖果油酱制造业、豆腐房、粉房、饮食业、饲养业等）。城市的粪便、垃圾、污水的处理必须尽可能地为附近的农业服务，可以采取由企业、机关、学校与农业社定立长期合同的方式，积极发展市区同附近的农业社在这一方面的合作。在一切公共活动场所和公共娱乐场所，必须注意清洁和防止传染病的传播。在厂、矿、工地和新开发地区，除了必须注意粪便、垃圾、污水的处理和蚊、蝇、老鼠的消灭以外，还需要特别注意饮食的管理，宿舍的清洁，工人健康的保护，职业病和多发病的防止。企业、机关、学校不但必须接受城镇的区街组织对于卫生工作的检查管理，而且应该充分利用自己的有利条件，克服目前某些单位的落后状态，积极地在除四害讲卫生的运动中起带头作用。在学校中，要加强卫生教育，把养成卫生习惯作为操行成绩的一个方面，并且要把学生参加校内外除四害讲卫生的活动作为整个劳动教育的一个部分。机关和部队也都必须参加城市除四害讲卫生的义务劳动。
    （二）在除四害、讲卫生的运动中，必须使群众力量和技术力量相结合，使突击工作和经常工作相结合。
    除四害讲卫生必须彻底依靠群众的力量，贯彻卫生工作中的群众路线和勤俭精神，反对那种认为讲卫生就必须花很多钱、购置很多药械、调集很多专家的错误观点。为了充分发动群众，必须把工会、青年团、妇女联合会的组织动员起来，把一切宣传力量动员起来，针对当地具体情况、当时具体要求和群众中存在的具体思想顾虑，进行生动有力的宣传。各种宣传形式，例如报刊、广播、幻灯、电影、大字报、宣传画、街道宣传、挨户宣传、参观、展览、群众大会、居民小组会等等，都应该尽量采用。关于除四害、讲卫生、防治疾病的基本常识和先进经验，报刊广播必须经常认真介绍，并且必须编印成小册子和画页，大量发行到基层去。群众中的除四害讲卫生的积极分子和先进集体，应该给予表扬和奖励。麻雀可以作食品，为了鼓励捕捉麻雀，可以实行收购。
    但是为了使群众运动迅速见效，必须同时使技术力量赶上去。这里包括对于四害和其他危害人类的生物的生活规律的研究，对于当地严重疾病的发生和流行的规律的研究，有效地消灭四害、消灭疾病的技术知识和经验的传播，具体计划（特别是消灭当地严重疾病的计划）的制订，大规模消灭四害、消灭疾病所必需的药物器械的介绍、生产和供应，必要的技术人员的训练和分配等等。现在许多地方的情况是，群众运动起来了，但是技术指导和科学研究还远远地落在后面，这种情况必须迅速改变。所有医药卫生机构和有关的科学研究机构、卫生人员和红十字会会员，都应该积极投入除四害讲卫生的群众运动中去，并且努力加强自己的工作，力求站到群众运动的前面来促进运动的发展。
    由于要动员千百万群众在短时期内改变千百万年的积习，由于群众的忙闲各个时间不等，而四害和许多病媒、病菌的活动又有一定的季节性，所以除四害讲卫生运动必须依靠一定的突击活动。在一年中间，春初四害开始活跃的时候是一场大战斗，夏秋间传染病猖獗的时候是一场大战斗，冬季结合积肥、修水利、改善卫生条件、消灭越冬蚊蝇又是一场大战斗。配合春节、五一节、国庆节举行大扫除，也是一种突击活动。除此以外，因时因地因事，配合检查评比，还会有突击活动。1958年是全国向四害和疾病大进军的第一年，今年的突击活动必然要比平常花费较多的时间。各基层单位（例如一个生产队，一个工段，一条街道）的除四害讲卫生工作，应该每星期检查一次，各较大单位（例如一个合作社，一个乡，城市一个工厂，一个区）应该每月检查评比一次，年终应该大检查总评比一次，以便为实现长期计划打下基础。
    在除四害讲卫生的斗争中，除了搞好突击活动，使运动一步比一步更深入更前进以外，还要使每一个单位每一户人家订出经常的工作计划，尽量使工作经常化，以补充突击活动的不足，巩固突击活动的成果。各个地方要根据当时当地的具体条件，有计划地循序渐进地向群众提出一些可以普遍作到的有关环境卫生和个人卫生的要求，并且要逐步把各级爱国卫生运动委员会、基层医疗机构和城乡的群众性卫生组织健全起来（在各企业、机关、学校、部队、街道、合作社都应该成立爱国卫生小组），使每一户人家每一个单位的卫生状况和卫生工作状况都经常有人检查、督促和指导，使各地的卫生工作能够月月改进，年年更新。
    （三）除四害讲卫生运动的决定关键，在于党的领导。各级党组织的第一书记对于这一运动必须亲自动手，抓规划，抓宣传，抓检查评比，并且要推动各单位的行政负责人同样亲自动手。
    各地方各单位的规划必须适合本地方本单位的情况。当地究竟有哪些严重疾病，有哪些主要的必须消灭的害虫害鸟害兽，各需要多长时间消灭，先后次序怎样摆，主要依靠什么力量什么方法，怎样同生产建设工作相结合，在制定计划的时候一定要心中有数。向群众提出的具体口号各地可以因地制宜，例如除四害在有血吸虫病地区要加上消灭钉螺，有黑热病地区要加上消灭白蛉子，有臭虫、跳蚤的地区要加上消灭臭虫、跳蚤，讲卫生在城市中可以包括劝止随地吐痰，在工厂中可以着重防治职业病等等。工作任务在几年中间需要分几个段落（例如首先着重除四害，随后转入消灭重要疾病），在一年的不同时间中也要定出不同的重点（例如何时集中消灭老鼠，何时集中消灭麻雀）。
    实现计划的时间要看群众运动发展的状况。凡是确有条件提前实现的应该争取提前实现，计划的内容也可以逐年有所补充修改。抓先进和落后的两头，带动中间，组织参观展览，这是领导生产的好方法，也是领导除四害讲卫生的好方法。各地必须善于运用这些方法，大力传播先进单位的经验，消灭运动中的“死角”，使全区的工作不断地向先进单位的水平看齐。
    各省、市、自治区和专区都必须在今年上半年定出本区的除四害、讲卫生、消灭重要疾病的年度计划和长期计划，并且必须按月按季对所属单位的工作状况加以检查评比通报，以便表扬先进，督促落后。十年看三年，三年看头年，只要各级党政组织认真负责，雷厉风行，坚持到底，我们就一定能够在今年内为这一工作打下巩固的基础，在几年内消灭四害，基本上消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，使全国的卫生状况大为改观。
