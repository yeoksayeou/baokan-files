Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th—The Indonesian Cabinet, at its cabinet meeting held on the evening of the 11th, rejected the so-called "Charter for the Defense of National Security" put forward by Husein, leader of the Central Sumatran "Wild Bull Division Council" which is rebelling against the central government, and other separatists. In this "ultimatum"-style "charter," the separatists arrogantly threatened the Indonesian Cabinet to resign within five days.

The Cabinet also decided to expel Husein, Lubis, Simbolon, and Dahlan Djambek from the army because they had engaged in activities that violated military discipline and endangered national security. All battalion commanders of the Fourth Infantry Regiment stationed in Central Sumatra, originally commanded by Husein, are temporarily under the direct leadership of the Army Chief of Staff, pending the appointment of a new regimental commander. A spokesman for the Army Chief of Staff said on the evening of the 11th that the Army Chief of Staff believed that the "ultimatum" presented to the government by Husein and others violated the oath of soldiers and the principles of the nation. The spokesman said that the Army Chief of Staff had ordered the military authorities in various provinces to strengthen vigilance and regularly report on the situation in their respective military regions.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th—A delegation composed of 43 representatives from various regions of Sumatra visited Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda on the 11th, expressing their opposition to the so-called "ultimatum" put forward on the evening of the 10th by Husein, leader of the Central Sumatran "Wild Bull Division Council" which is rebelling against the central government, and his accomplices. The delegation expressed its full support for the current government and demanded that the government take severe measures against these rebellious elements.

Prime Minister Juanda said when receiving the delegation that the government could not accept the "ultimatum." He said that the Sumatra issue must be resolved under the premise of avoiding war, but this does not mean that the government is unwilling to take resolute measures. Prime Minister Juanda pointed out that at present, the local disturbances have exceeded the scope of Indonesia's internal problems, because external forces are interfering in affairs.

    朱安达内阁严拒分裂分子的“最后通牒”
    决定把侯赛尼等开除出军队
    苏门答腊代表团要求严厉对付反叛集团
    新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚内阁在11日傍晚举行的内阁会议上，拒绝了反叛中央的中苏门答腊“雄牛师委员会”领袖侯赛尼和其他分裂分子提出的所谓“保卫国家安全宪章”。分裂分子在这个“最后通牒”式的“宪章”中，狂妄地威胁印度尼西亚内阁在五天内辞职。
    内阁还决定把侯赛尼、卢比斯、西姆波朗和达兰·贾姆贝克开除出军队，因为他们进行了违反军纪和危害国家安全的活动。原来由侯赛尼指挥的驻在中苏门答腊的第四步兵团的所有营长暂时归陆军参谋长直接领导，等待任命新的团长。陆军参谋长的发言人在11日晚上说，陆军参谋长认为，侯赛尼等人向政府提出的“最后通牒”违反了军人的誓言和国家的准则。发言人说，陆军参谋长已经命令各省军事当局加强警惕，并且经常报告他们所管辖的各个军区的情况。
    据新华社雅加达12日电　由苏门答腊各地区的四十三名代表组成的一个代表团在11日拜访了印度尼西亚总理朱安达，表示反对反叛中央的中苏门答腊“雄牛师委员会”领袖侯赛尼和他的同谋者在10日晚间提出的所谓“最后通牒”。代表团表示充分支持现政府，并且要求政府对这些叛逆分子采取严厉的措施。
    朱安达总理在接见代表团的时候表示，政府不能接受“最后通牒”。他说，苏门答腊问题必须在避免战争的前提下解决，但是这并不表明政府不愿采取坚决的措施。朱安达总理指出，目前，地方上的骚乱事件已经超出了印度尼西亚内部问题的范围，因为外来的力量在干预事务。
