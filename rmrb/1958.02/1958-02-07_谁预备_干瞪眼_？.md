A Note

　　Who is Preparing to "Stare Each Other Down"?
    At a press conference on the 5th, Eisenhower once again poured cold water on the summit conference of great powers. In order to find a reason for his obstruction of the conference, he said with great seriousness: "It is clear that if it is known in advance that both sides will fundamentally not make concessions to each other's arguments, and frankly speaking, they are just staring each other down across the table, then there is no benefit in participating in a top-level meeting."
    Eisenhower's statement seems to be not entirely unreasonable. Who wants to hold a summit conference where everyone "stares each other down"? However, the Soviet Union is not preparing to go to the summit conference to "stare each other down." Not only can this be believed from the Soviet Union's consistent attitude towards great power consultation, but also from the sincerity shown in Bulganin's recent letters to Western countries.
    What about the American side? Eisenhower himself has always believed that there is no benefit in holding a summit conference. Therefore, it is conceivable that the United States intends to go to the meeting to "stare each other down."
    However, the American government leaders clearly know that under the gaze of the world's people, it is a bit difficult to "stare each other down" regardless of everything. It is precisely because of this that the Washington authorities are doing everything possible to prevent the summit conference from succeeding.

　　谁预备“干瞪眼”？
    艾森豪威尔在5日记者招待会上又再给大国首脑会议泼冷水。他为了替自己阻挠会议召开的行径找理由，一本正经地说：“很清楚，如果事先知道双方都根本不会使自己迁就对方的论点，而且坦白地说，彼此只是在桌子两头面对面地干瞪眼，那么参加最高级会议就不会有什么益处。”
    艾森豪威尔的这种说法好像并不是毫无道理的，谁希望举行一次大家“干瞪眼”的最高级会议呢？但是苏联并不是准备到最高级会议上去“干瞪眼”的。不仅是苏联一贯对待大国协商的态度上可以使人相信这一点，布尔加宁最近给西方国家的几封信中所表现的诚意也可以使人相信这一点。
    美国方面怎么样呢？艾森豪威尔本人就是一直认为召开最高级会议没有什么好处。因此可以想见，美国是打算到会上去“干瞪眼”的。
    不过美国的政府首脑显然知道，在世界人民千目所视之下，想不顾一切地“干瞪眼”是有点困难的。正是因为这样，所以华盛顿当局不惜千方百计阻止最高级会议开成功。
