Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Washington: Wernher von Braun, designer of the American "Jupiter" rocket, told reporters on February 1st that the United States would need five years to have any hope of "catching up with the Soviet Union" in rocket and missile technology.

Braun was the chief designer of Hitler's German V-2 rockets and was captured by the United States in World War II. The scientist, originally from Germany, said that the latest U.S. satellite launch was "merely competing with the Soviet Union's artificial satellites in spirit."

Braun also mentioned that one of the reasons for the success of the American satellite launch was the change to a type of "fuel that is more or less imported."

When asked about the relative position of the U.S. achievements compared to those of the Soviet Union, he said, "We must remember that the weight of the equipment launched by the United States—the weight of the satellite itself—is only a fraction of the weight of the Soviet Union's first satellite (180 pounds), and is much lighter compared to the weight of the Soviet Union's second satellite (1,100 pounds)."

Reuters reported that Braun's remarks "reduced" the "sense of joy" that existed in the United States at the time of its satellite launch.

　　“丘辟特”式火箭设计师布劳恩说
    美国在火箭方面比苏联落后五年
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国“丘辟特”式火箭设计师韦尔纳·布劳恩2月1日对新闻记者说，美国需要五年的时间才有希望在火箭和导弹技术方面“赶上苏联”。
    布劳恩是希特勒德国V—2火箭的主要设计人，他在第二次世界大战中被美国俘去。这个原籍德国的科学家说，美国这一次发射卫星“只是在精神上同苏联的人造卫星竞赛”。
    布劳恩还谈到，美国卫星发射成功的原因之一是由于改用了一种“不如说是舶来品的燃料”。
    有人问到美国的成就同苏联的成就比较起来居于何等地位，他说，“我们必须记住：美国发射的器械的重量——卫星本身的重量——只有苏联的第一个卫星的重量（一百八十磅）的若干分之一，而同苏联的第二个卫星的重量（一千一百磅）的重量相比更要轻得多。”
    路透社记者报道说，布劳恩的谈话使美国在它的卫星发射时所存在的“喜悦情绪”“降低了”。
