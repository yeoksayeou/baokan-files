　　Less Bragging is Better
　　Although it was "called forth after a thousand requests," the United States finally launched an artificial satellite, which is always a welcome thing, as long as the American satellite is for scientific research and not for other ulterior motives.
　　But being able to launch such a satellite that is much lighter, much smaller, requires a much lower level of rocket technology, and can reach a much smaller area than the Soviet artificial satellite, is nothing to brag about. As some Western newspapers have said, it is not enough to redeem the face lost by the United States in the past few embarrassments, let alone show that American science and technology are still far behind the Soviet Union.
　　However, Dulles immediately became ecstatic and boasted that the United States "can do almost anything." Dulles's arrogance can only be met with scorn. Because, until now, the United States has not been able to launch a satellite that can fly over the White House, and the red moon of the Soviet Union still hangs high in the sky over Washington.

　　少吹为妙
    虽然是“千呼万唤始出来”，美国终于发射了一个人造卫星，总是一件可喜的事情，只要美国的这个卫星是为了科学研究而不是别的不可告人的目的。
    但是能够发射这样一个比苏联的人造卫星轻得多、小得多、所需的火箭技术水平低得多、可以达到的地区范围小得多的卫星，是没有什么值得吹牛的。正如一些西方报刊所说的，它还不足以挽回美国过去几次出丑所失去的面子，更不用说它表明了美国的科学技术仍然远远落在苏联的后面了。
    然而杜勒斯马上得意忘形，大吹什么美国“几乎什么事都能办得到”。杜勒斯的这种大言不惭只能使人嗤之以鼻。因为，直到现在美国还发射不了一个能够在白宫头顶飞过的卫星，华盛顿的上空还仍然高悬着苏联的红色月亮哩。
