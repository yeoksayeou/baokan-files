    A Major Event in China's Labor and Wage Work

    The State Council's four provisional regulations regarding the handling of employee retirement, wage treatment for ordinary workers and odd-job men, the duration of apprenticeships and living allowances, and employee home visits, after more than two months of extensive discussions by millions of employees, repeated research and revisions by government labor departments, and approval by the State Council's plenary meeting and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, are being announced and implemented today. This is a major event in China's labor and wage work.

    Labor wages and labor insurance benefits are complex issues. They are closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people and are a concrete manifestation of the socialist principles of production and distribution. Correctly handling this issue can promote the development of social productive forces and accelerate the advancement of socialist construction. However, people have various demands for life, and there can be different proportions in production and distribution. What standards should be used to solve these problems? There must be a unified understanding. Starting from the fact that we have 600 million people, taking overall consideration and making appropriate arrangements is the basic principle we adopt to solve these problems. As Chairman Mao told us: "When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people," "Our policy is to take overall consideration and make appropriate arrangements." All the measures in the four regulations are formulated based on these instructions. Its basic spirit is that when dealing with labor wages and labor insurance benefits, we must consider both the interests of the state and the interests of individuals; we must not allow too much disparity between the living standards of workers and peasants, but also take into account the special conditions of urban and worker life; we must consider the unity of new and old workers, but also not ignore the technical differences between them, and so on. Last November, when the State Council decided to submit the draft of the four regulations to the broad masses for discussion, this newspaper made extensive explanations on these issues. Today, we are very pleased to see that after several months of discussion, the level of understanding of the broad masses of employees has been generally improved, and they have a comprehensive understanding of labor wages and labor insurance benefits. Starting from the fact that we have 600 million people, considering problems, and solving problems, this idea has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

    The discussion situation of employees in various places and mass letters show that the broad masses of employees warmly support the four regulations and have put forward many valuable opinions in the discussions. For example: the draft stipulated that employees who have worked for ten years can enjoy retirement and pension benefits. Employees in the discussion believed that retirement and pension benefits must be enjoyed with considerable contributions to society, and ten years of work seemed too broad and should be appropriately increased. The draft did not stipulate the issue of apprentices enjoying reward allowances and labor insurance benefits. Employees believed that enjoying rewards and labor insurance benefits is of positive significance for exerting the enthusiasm and creativity of production and should be considered for supplementation. The draft stipulated that car and boat fares for returning home to visit relatives exceeding one-half or one-third of the employee's salary could be subsidized. Employees believed that the country's economy is still very difficult, and it is already preferential treatment to continue to pay wages during the home visit period. It is unreasonable to subsidize everyone regardless of whether they have financial difficulties. All these opinions fully demonstrate the sense of responsibility and selfless spirit of the employees as masters of the country. It is this spirit that has driven many people to handle the relationship between individuals and the state with a correct attitude, and has driven a vigorous new situation in various labor fronts.

    The drafting, discussion, revision, and promulgation and implementation of the four regulations fully implement the mass line. This is a major innovation in China's labor and wage work and a method that the broad masses of employees particularly appreciate. The fact that the masses put forward more than 168,000 opinions in just over two months is a very good illustration. We believe that rules and regulations belong to the superstructure, and they serve the economic base. In order to adapt to the development and changes of the economic base, rules and regulations must also be frequently revised and supplemented. In the past few years, in order to put various tasks on the right track, various departments have formulated many rules and regulations. Many of these rules and regulations have played a positive role in China's socialist construction, but a considerable number of rules and regulations, due to the limitations of past experience and the changes in the situation in recent years, have now revealed some shortcomings and problems, which are not conducive to building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way and improving the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses. To revise these rules and regulations, it is certainly necessary to have top-down inspections, but more importantly, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to speak out freely and debate. As Comrade Ma Wenrui, Minister of Labor, said in his explanation: For these rules and regulations, "we must adopt a method that combines mobilizing the masses from the bottom up for discussion and systematically inspecting from the top down." The success of this discussion once again proves the correctness of the mass line pointed out by the Party.

    It should be pointed out that in this discussion, there are still a few people who are preoccupied with personal interests and lack the attitude of being masters of the country. Some people believe that daughters-in-law and parents who live in different places should also be stipulated to have visiting leave. Some people demand that apprentices be taken care of by the state for food and clothing from the beginning, earning money to support their families, and so on. These demands, from a personal perspective, seem reasonable, but they are inconsistent with the collective interest. Expanding the enjoyment of visiting relatives' benefits will require the state to pay huge holiday wages and prepare a huge reserve workforce. As for the demand to have the apprentice's life completely "taken care of" by the public, it is also unreasonable. Every issue has a standard of right and wrong. Without standards, there is no right and wrong. From comparing the State Council's revised four provisional regulations with the past drafts, we can clearly see that the standard of right and wrong is: starting from the fact that we have 600 million people, starting from strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and being conducive to developing production. Measuring various opinions according to these standards can lead to correct handling. The State Council's four regulations were revised in accordance with the above principles. Minister of Labor Ma Wenrui's explanation clearly reflects that all correct opinions have been adopted, and all incorrect opinions and excessive demands have not been adopted.

    Now the four provisional regulations promulgated by the State Council will be implemented across the country. When implementing them, we must also formulate detailed rules for implementation according to the specific situation. In the process, we will encounter many specific problems and ideological problems, such as the proper resettlement of retired personnel, labor arrangements during home visits, apprentice training plans, etc., all of which require a lot of specific organizational and ideological work. To do these tasks well, we should also adopt the working method of the mass line, combine it with the rectification movement, mobilize the masses, let everyone speak out freely, fully, contend, and debate, so that all problems can be solved practically. Facts have proven that adhering to believing in the majority of the masses can surely get things done well and make the Party and the state's policies and laws become the thoughts and actions of the masses.

### 我国劳动工资工作中的一件大事

    我国劳动工资工作中的一件大事
    国务院关于职工退休处理、普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇、学徒的学习期限和生活补贴、职工回家探亲等四项暂行规定，经过几百万职工两个多月的广泛讨论，经过政府劳动部门的反复研究和修改，经过国务院全体会议通过和人大常委会的批准，在今天公布施行了。这是我国劳动工资工作中的一件大事。
    劳动工资和劳保福利，是一个复杂的问题。它同广大人民的生活密切相关，也是社会主义的生产和分配原则的具体体现。正确地处理了这个问题，就可以促进社会生产力的发展，加速社会主义建设事业的前进。但是，人民对于生活有各种不同的要求，生产和分配也可以有不同的比例，究竟根据什么标准来解决这些问题呢？必须要有一个统一的认识。从六亿人口出发、统筹兼顾、适当安排，这就是我们解决这些问题所采取的基本方针。正如毛主席告诉我们的：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”，“我们的方针是统筹兼顾，适当安排”。四项规定的所有措施，正是根据这些指示制定的。它的基本精神是，在处理劳动工资和劳保福利的时候，既要照顾国家的利益，也要照顾个人的利益；既要使工农生活水平不要有太大的悬殊，也要照顾城市和工人生活的特殊条件；既要照顾新老工人的团结，也不能漠视他们之间的技术差别，等等。去年11月，国务院决定将四项规定草案提交广大群众讨论的时候，本报曾经对这些问题作过广泛的说明。今天，我们非常高兴地看到，经过几个月的讨论，广大职工的认识水平有了普遍的提高，对于劳动工资和劳保福利问题有了全面的认识。从六亿人口出发，考虑问题，解决问题，这个思想已经是深入人心了。
    各地职工讨论的情况和群众来信表明，广大职工群众是热烈拥护四项规定的，并且在讨论中提出了很多宝贵的意见。例如：草案中规定职工劳动十年可以享受退休养老的待遇，职工们在讨论中认为：退休养老必须对社会有相当贡献才能享受，劳动十年显得太宽了，应该适当提高。草案中对学徒享受奖励津贴和劳保待遇问题没有规定，职工们认为：享受奖励和劳保待遇，对发挥生产的积极性和创造性有积极意义，应该考虑补充。草案中规定回家探亲的车船费超过本人工资二分之一或三分之一的可以补助，职工们认为：目前国家经济还很困难，探亲期间，工资照发，已经是优待了，如果不问经济上是否困难，一律补助是不合理的。所有这些意见，充分表现了职工们的主人翁的责任感和大公无私的精神。正是这种精神，带动了许多人以正确的态度来处理个人和国家之间的关系，带动了各个劳动战线上出现蓬蓬勃勃的新局面。
    四项规定的起草、讨论、修改，直至公布施行，充分地贯彻了群众路线。这是我国劳动工资工作的重大革新，也是广大职工特别表示满意的一种办法。在短短的两个多月中，群众提出了十六万八千多条意见，这就是一个很好的说明。我们认为，规章制度是属于上层建筑的东西，它是为经济基础服务的，为了适应经济基础的发展和变化，规章制度也必须经常修改和补充。在过去几年中，为了使各项工作走上正轨，各个部门曾经制定了不少的规章制度。这些规章制度，有许多对于我国社会主义建设事业起了积极作用，但是，也有相当一部分规章制度，由于过去经验的局限性和几年来情况的变化，现在已经显露出若干缺点和毛病，不利于多快好省地建设社会主义和提高群众的觉悟和积极性。要修改这些规章制度，固然需要由上而下的检查，但是更重要的，则是发动群众鸣放辩论。正如劳动部长马文瑞同志的说明中所说的：对于这些规章制度，“必须采取由下而上地发动群众讨论和由上而下地系统地检查相结合的方法”。这次讨论的成功，再一次证明了党所指出的群众路线的正确。
    应当指出，在这次讨论中，还有少数人斤斤计较个人利益，缺乏主人翁的态度。有的人认为儿媳和父母分居两地，也应该规定探望假期。有的人要求学徒开始就由国家管吃管穿，挣钱养家，等等。这些要求，从个人角度来看，似乎是合理的，然而，这是同集体利益不符的。扩大了探亲的享受待遇，国家就要付出巨大的假期工资，同时，还要准备庞大的预备工队伍。至于把学徒的生活全部由公家“包下来”的要求，也是不合理的。任何问题都有一个是非标准，没有标准就没有是非。我们从国务院修正四项暂行规定和过去的草案比较，可以清楚地看到，是非标准就是：从六亿人口出发，从加强工农联盟出发，有利于发展生产。根据这些标准来衡量各种意见，就可以得到正确的处理。国务院的四项规定，正是按照上述原则加以修正的。劳动部长马文瑞的说明，清楚地反映了凡是属于正确的意见都被采纳了，凡是错误的意见和过高的要求，都没有采纳。
    现在国务院颁布的四项暂行规定就要在全国各地贯彻执行了。在贯彻执行的时候，还要按具体的情况，制定实施细则。在这中间，还会碰到许多具体问题和思想问题，如退休人员的妥善安置，探亲期间的劳动安排，学徒工的学习规划等等，都要作许多具体的组织工作和思想工作。要作好这些工作，同样地应当采取群众路线的工作方法，结合整风运动，发动群众，大鸣、大放，大争、大辩，使各项问题都得到切合实际的解决。事实证明：坚持相信群众大多数，一定可以把事情办好，使党和国家的政策法令成为群众的思想和行动。
