    A New Explanation of American Aid
    To promote the US foreign aid program, Washington government officials are coming out to publicize it. US President Dwight D. Eisenhower made a high-sounding speech, saying that foreign aid is essential to help allies "become self-reliant," "help them improve their living standards," and help them "strengthen their own power." Vice President Richard Nixon even asked the American people to "make sacrifices" to pay for foreign aid.
    If things were really as these two presidents said, the American ruling group could be called "benevolent and charitable." But another supporter, Mr. Stevenson, probably afraid that some people would be unwilling to "make sacrifices" to do this "good deed," explained that American foreign aid is "not a charitable undertaking, but a kind of circulating capital."
    The words of these American politicians, taken together, reveal the essence of so-called American foreign aid: under the guise of helping others, they do things that benefit themselves; they make taxpayers pay the bills so that big bosses can get rich.
    Not to be Manipulated
    Just as the world is increasingly calling for American troops to go home, Eisenhower put forward a new theory on the 24th. He said: The United States must try its best to avoid being "gradually pushed back from its current borders," and must never allow "the United States to become a country with troops stationed everywhere."
    Eisenhower's statement nakedly exposed the true face of American imperialism: America's borders are not on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean and the west coast of the Atlantic Ocean in the Americas, but in Western Europe to the west, Japan and South Korea to the east, and even further places; American troops must be stationed on the territory of other countries forever, not on their own territory.
    Eisenhower also said that some people "are trying to deprive us of this natural right and make us subject to the manipulation of other countries." People wonder when God endowed America with such a right? Today, the people of all countries want to deprive the United States of its privilege of occupying their land, but this is not to manipulate the United States, but to exercise their natural rights and refuse to be manipulated by the United States.

    札记
    美援新解
    为了推销美国的援外计划，华盛顿的政府官员都出来大力宣传。美国总统艾森豪威尔冠冕堂皇地讲了一套，说什么对外援助之所以必不可少是因为要帮助盟国“自立”，“帮助它们提高生活水平”，帮助它们“加强自己的力量”。副总统尼克松甚至要求美国人民为了支付对外援助款项而“作出牺牲”。
    如果事情真如这两位总统所说的那样，美国的统治集团可谓“乐善好施”了。但是另一位帮腔的史蒂文森先生，大概是怕有人不愿“作出牺牲”来做这种“善事”，解释说，美国的对外援助“不是作为一种慈善事业，而是作为一种流动资本。”
    这几位美国政客的话加在一起，算是道出了美国所谓对外援助的实质：打着帮助别人的幌子，来干有利自己的事；让纳税人掏腰包，使大老板发财。
    不受摆布
    正当全世界要求美国军队滚回去的呼声日益高涨的时候，艾森豪威尔在24日却发表一套新理论。他说：美国要极力避免“从目前所在的边界上被逐渐推回来”，而且决不能让“美国成为一个到处驻扎军队的国家。”
    艾森豪威尔这段表白，把美国帝国主义的真面目赤裸裸地暴露了出来：美国的边界不是在美洲的太平洋东岸和大西洋西岸，而是在西至西欧、东至日本、南朝鲜，甚至更远的地方；美国的军队必须永远驻扎在别国的领土上，而不是驻扎在自己的领土上。
    艾森豪威尔还说什么，有人“企图剥夺我们这一天赋的权利，而使我们听凭别的国家的摆布。”人们奇怪上帝什么时候赋予了美国这样的权利呢？今天各国人民就是要剥夺美国占领他们国土的特权，不过这并不是什么要摆布美国，而是行使他们天赋的权利，不甘听凭美国的摆布罢了。
