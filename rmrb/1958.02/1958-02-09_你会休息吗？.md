　　Do You Know How to Rest?
　　Lù Yuānyīng
    Comrade Lenin once said that those who know how to rest can work well. Yes, whether you are mainly engaged in physical labor or mental labor, you need to rest after work. A good rest will make you more energetic when you work. After getting off work and returning home, some people like to turn on the radio to listen to songs and news; some people like to read newspapers or play chess; some people like to take a walk or play ball in the park; and some people like to lie down and sleep. These are usually called rest. But which kind of rest is the best?
    The father of Russian physiology, Sechenov (1829-1905), firmly opposed quiet, motionless rest methods. He conducted such an experiment: he gave the tired right hand a quiet rest, and at the same time used the non-tired left hand to rhythmically lift and lower things. At this time, the right hand could get a better rest. Sechenov also determined through many experiments that the most effective and beneficial rest is not only a short period of quiet rest for the tired right hand (this is called passive rest), but also the left hand (or other organs) working at the same time (active rest). According to Sechenov's opinion, completely quiet and motionless rest is not very good. Of course, the already tired organs need a quiet rest, but the other organs of the whole body can be in an active state, so that the tired organs can better and faster eliminate fatigue. Therefore, if we feel tired from doing a certain job, we can use other organs to do another job, which is the best way to rest. Of course, we should also consider our own physical conditions, and proper sleep is still necessary.
    People who do more physical labor can do some more mentally demanding activities during rest, such as reading books and newspapers, playing chess, listening to music, or doing other recreational activities. People who do more mental labor should combine more physical labor during rest, such as tidying up the house, cleaning the yard, or doing some outdoor activities, such as playing ball, skating, walking, etc. You can stick to it according to your personal preferences, which will be of great benefit to your health. In short, we should learn to rest actively.

### 你会休息吗？

　　你会休息吗？
　　陆渊英
    列宁同志曾说过会休息的人才会工作。是的，无论你主要从事体力劳动还是脑力劳动，工作完了以后，都需要休息。休息得好，工作起来就更加精力充沛。下班以后回到家里，有的人愿意打开收音机听听歌曲和新闻；有的人喜欢看看报纸或下象棋；有的人喜欢到公园散散步或打打球；也有的人愿意躺下来睡大觉。通常把这些都叫作休息。但是那一种休息最好呢？
    俄罗斯生理学之父谢切诺夫（1829—1905）坚决反对安静不动的休息方法。他作过这样一个试验：对感到疲劳的右手给以安静的休息，同时用没有疲劳的左手有节拍地提起和放下东西，这时候右手便可以得到较好的休息。谢切诺夫还通过许多试验确定了：最有效和最有益处的休息不仅是疲劳的右手要短时间安静的休息（这叫消极的休息），而同时还要左手（或其他器官）作工作（积极的休息）。根据谢切诺夫的意见，完全安静不动的休息并不是很好的。已经感到疲劳的器官当然要安静的休息，可是整个身体的其他器官可以处在积极的活动状态中，这样就能够使感到疲劳的器官更好地和更快地消除疲劳。所以我们作某一种工作感到疲劳了，可以用另外的器官去作另一种工作，这才是最好的休息方法。当然还应该考虑自己的身体条件如何，而且适当的睡眠还是必要的。
    体力劳动较多的人，休息时可以做些比较费脑力的活动。如看书看报，下棋、欣赏音乐，或作其他游艺活动等。脑力劳动较多的人，在休息时应多结合些体力劳动，如整理住房，清扫庭院，或者作些户外活动，如打球、溜冰、散步等。可以随着个人不同的爱好，坚持作下去，这样就会对身体有很大好处。总之，我们应该学会积极的休息。
