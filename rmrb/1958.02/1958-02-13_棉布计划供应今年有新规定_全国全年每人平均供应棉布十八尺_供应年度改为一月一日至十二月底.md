Xinhua News Agency, 12th — The State Council has approved the Ministry of Commerce's report on cotton cloth supply for 1958.

The report states that cotton production in 1957 is expected to reach 32.8 million dan. The procurement situation is good, estimated to reach 27 million dan. Therefore, in 1958, more than 5 million bales of cotton yarn and more than 150 million bolts of cotton cloth can be produced. At the same time, more than 2 million dan of cotton can be reserved to implement the principle of "making up for lean years with good years." With this reserve, even in a lean year, the stability of cotton yarn production can be basically guaranteed, and the planned supply of cotton cloth to the people can also be ensured.

When issuing cloth coupons for the fourth cotton cloth planned supply year, it was stipulated that the national annual average quota was sixteen feet per person. If there was a bumper cotton harvest, efforts would be made to reach eighteen feet. Now, due to the bumper cotton harvest and increased yarn and cloth production, it has been decided to supply an average of eighteen feet of cotton cloth per person nationwide in 1958.

The report states that the method for distributing civilian cloth, since the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth in September 1954, has been to use September 1st of the current year to August 31st of the following year as a planned supply year, and distribute cloth coupons in two installments. According to several years of experience, the disadvantage of this method is that the planned supply quota for the next year's cotton cloth must be decided in June, when cotton production cannot yet be estimated, which can easily lead to quotas that are too high or too low. To overcome the above shortcomings, the Ministry of Commerce proposed in the report that from 1958, the cotton cloth planned supply year be changed from January 1st to December 31st. Since the first installment of cloth coupons for the fourth planned supply year was issued until the end of February 1958, the 1958 quota will be issued for ten months starting in March, until December 31st. From 1959, the full year's cloth coupons for January-December will be issued annually.

Regarding the number of coupons and the method of issuing coupons this year, eleven feet have already been issued for the first installment (six months) of the fourth planned supply year. To take care of the need for cloth in the winter of 1957, 80% was calculated as 8.8 feet before the end of December 1957, and there are still 2.2 feet for January-February 1958. That is to say, to meet the 1958 annual quota of eighteen feet, subtracting the 2.2 feet for January and February, 15.8 feet still need to be issued for the ten months from March to December. For ease of calculation, sixteen feet will be issued.

In order to regulate winter cloth use, the March-December 1958 cloth coupons will still be issued in two installments: the first installment (March-August), six months, will be issued at a national average of seven feet per person, and the second installment (September-December), four months, will be issued at a national average of nine feet per person.

In addition, the report also proposes that, in order to take care of the people's cloth needs, the first installment of cloth coupons for the fourth planned supply year (i.e., the September 1957 to February 1958 cloth coupons) can continue to be used until the end of August 1958, after which they cannot be used; the March-August 1958 cloth coupons can be used until the end of December; and the September-December cloth coupons cannot be used in advance.

The report concludes by stating that although there is a bumper cotton harvest this year, the cotton reserves are still not large. In order to implement the central government's principle of "making up for lean years with good years," all localities must strictly adhere to the stipulated targets and not exceed them, and must continue to implement the various provisions of the fourth annual cotton cloth unified sales implementation plan.

### 棉布计划供应今年有新规定  全国全年每人平均供应棉布十八尺  供应年度改为一月一日至十二月底

    棉布计划供应今年有新规定
    全国全年每人平均供应棉布十八尺
    供应年度改为一月一日至十二月底
    新华社12日讯　关于商业部1958年棉布供应问题的报告已经国务院批准。
    报告说，1957年棉花生产量可达到三千二百八十万担；收购情况良好，估计可达到二千七百万担。因而1958年可生产棉纱五百多万件，棉布一万五千多万匹；同时还可以储备棉花二百多万担，以贯彻“以丰补歉”的方针。有了这个储备，如果遇到一个歉年，就可以基本保证棉纱生产的稳定，从而人民群众的棉布计划供应，也可得到保证。
    在第四棉布计划供应年度发放布票时曾经规定：在这个计划供应年度里全国全年每人平均定量是十六尺，如果棉花丰收，争取达到十八尺。现在由于棉花丰收，纱布增产，1958年决定供应棉布全国平均每人十八尺。
    报告说，民用布发放办法，自1954年9月开始实行棉布计划供应以来，都是以当年9月1日至下年8月31日为一个计划供应年度，分两期发放布票。根据几年来的经验，这个办法的缺点是下一年度的棉布计划供应定量必须在6月份决定，当时棉花产量尚不能估计，容易产生定量偏高、偏低的现象。为了克服以上的缺点，商业部在报告中提出：从1958年起，把棉布计划供应年度改为从1月1日起至12月31日止。由于第四计划供应年度第一期布票是发到1958年2月底的，因此1958年度由3月份起发十个月的布票，发到12月31日为止，从1959年起按年度发给1—12月的全年布票。
    关于今年发票数量和发票办法，第四计划供应年度第一期（六个月）已发十一尺，为了照顾1957年冬季用布，1957年12月底以前按80％计算为八点八尺，1958年1—2月尚有二点二尺。即是说，1958年全年十八尺的定量，减去1、2月份的二点二尺，3—12月份十个月尚需发放十五点八尺。为了便于计算起见，发十六尺。
    为了调节冬季用布，1958年3—12月布票仍分上下两期发放：上期（3—8月份）六个月全国每人平均发七尺，下期（9—12月份）四个月全国平均每人发九尺。
    此外，报告中还提出，为了照顾人民群众的用布需要，第四计划供应年度第一期布票（即1957年9月至1958年2月布票）可以继续通用到1958年8月底，过期不能再使用；1958年3—8月的布票可以通用到12月底；9月至12月的布票则不能提前使用。
    报告最后说，由于今年棉花虽然丰收，但棉花储备还是不多的，为了贯彻中央“以丰补歉”的方针，各地对规定的各项指标务必严格掌握，不要突破，并须继续贯彻第四年度棉布统销实施方案的各项规定。
