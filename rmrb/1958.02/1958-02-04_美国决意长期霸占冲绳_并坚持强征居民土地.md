Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: According to a Kyodo News Agency Washington dispatch, U.S. State Department officials emphasized on February 2nd that the U.S. policy towards Okinawa has essentially not changed. These officials denied rumors that the U.S. is considering returning administrative rights over Okinawa to Japan.

According to reports, U.S. State Department officials also said that the U.S. will not modify or relax its established policy on the U.S. military's requisition of land in Okinawa simply because of the recent result of the Naha mayoral election.

According to a Kyodo News Agency Naha dispatch, U.S. military authorities have already issued an announcement on January 20th to places like Gushichan Village in Naha City, declaring that they will use a lump-sum payment method to requisition local land for a long period of time. Local residents are urgently discussing countermeasures regarding this matter.

　　美国决意长期霸占冲绳
    并坚持强征居民土地
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：据共同社华盛顿消息说，美国国务院人士2月2日强调说，美国对冲绳的政策基本上没有变动。这些人士否认美国正在考虑把冲绳的行政权归还给日本的传说。
    据报道，美国国务院人士还说，美国不会仅仅因为最近那霸市长选举的结果而修改或放松对美军在冲绳征用土地的问题的既定政策。
    据共同社那霸消息，美军当局已经在1月20日向那霸市具志头村等地发表公告，宣布用一次付清租金的办法长期征用当地的土地。当地居民正在为这件事情紧急商议对策。
