Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 13th: The Beijing Railway Administration's 1958 Conference of Advanced Producers and Worker Representatives passed a proposal on the 11th from the Beijing Railway Administration to fifteen fraternal bureaus across the country, suggesting a competition.

The proposal states that the workers of the Beijing Railway Administration will, in the spirit of revolution, launch a massive million ton-kilometer per day movement, ensuring that the entire bureau increases production from the current 840,000 ton-kilometers per day to 1 million ton-kilometers per day before May 1st, and saving 80 million yuan for the country throughout the year. They propose this as a condition for initiating a socialist competition with fraternal bureaus nationwide.

The proposal says that to achieve this goal, the workers of the Beijing Railway Administration guarantee to resolutely implement the principles of building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, handling all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. They will mobilize all positive factors, tap all potential strengths, and further deepen the anti-waste movement, burning away all wasteful phenomena. They have decided to demand even higher standards of themselves, guaranteeing a technical speed of 45 kilometers, a static load of 37.1 tons, a travel speed of 32 kilometers per hour, a transfer time of 2.3 hours, a stopping time of 6.5 hours, a daily wagon kilometerage of 360 kilometers, a daily locomotive kilometerage of 480 kilometers, an average gross weight of 2,200 tons for freight trains, 100% punctuality for passenger train departures and operations, 98% punctuality for freight train departures and 95% punctuality for operations, a 32.1% rate for direct freight trains, a track inspection car score of 0.8 points, a total defect rate of 5.6% for locomotive repair defects, a section defect rate of 3.3%, and ensuring that capital construction and major repair projects are fast, of good quality, and low in cost. They will improve the quality of passenger service, achieving "four goods" (good service, good safety, good cleanliness, good economy) and "four no's" (no mosquitoes, no flies, no rats, no bedbugs), and guaranteeing safe operations and the elimination of accidents.

The proposal says that the workers of the Beijing Railway Administration have decided to launch a wave of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, conducting two comprehensive comparisons throughout the bureau this year. They will compare plans, compare indicators, compare savings, compare technology, compare safety, compare enthusiasm, and compare cooperation; they will compare station with station, section with section, team with team, group with group, and individual with individual. Through these comparisons, they will achieve mutual learning, so that the advanced become even more advanced, and the backward catch up with the advanced, achieving a common great leap forward.

The proposal calls for ensuring the strengthening of organization and discipline, strengthening unity, and conscientiously implementing various rules and regulations; ensuring the active learning of advanced experiences and the carrying out of the rationalization proposal movement.

The proposal concludes by guaranteeing that under the leadership of the Party, all workers and their families will unite closely, demonstrate the heroic spirit of the working class, muster their energy, strive for the upstream, overcome all difficulties, and promote a great leap forward in railway transportation, in order to adapt to the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production.
