Xinhua News Agency, February 24th – The 36 automobile drivers of the General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, based on the characteristics of the work of automobile drivers in government offices and the results of experimentation, recently proposed to the drivers of various municipal-level organs that they should not mechanically apply the eight-hour work system used in industrial enterprises, but should instead implement a system of working one full shift.

Inspired by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of work, these drivers are full of energy. When discussing how to achieve a leap forward in driver work, they all agreed that the work of government office automobile drivers is not like the continuous labor of industrial workers. On average, they spend less than half of their eight hours driving, and it is necessary to reform this. In order to further improve their work, they also proposed in their initiative: guarantee availability on call and no rest until the task is completed; work as usual when there is a task during off-duty hours; no lateness, no early departure, and no absenteeism; safe driving throughout the year without personal injury or liability accidents.

These drivers have been implementing the one-full-shift method since February 14. As a result, they feel that manpower is abundant. One driver has already gone to learn how to operate a portable boiler, and they are now studying further reductions in personnel to support construction.

    汽车司机一班顶到底
    北京市人委司机向市级机关司机提出倡议
    新华社24日讯　北京市人民委员会机关事务管理处三十六名汽车司机，根据机关汽车司机的工作特点和实验的结果，最近向市级各机关司机倡议不机械搬用工业企业中工作八小时制度，实行一班顶到底的办法。
    这些司机在工农业生产和各方面工作大跃进的鼓舞下，干劲十足。他们在讨论司机工作如何跃进的问题时，都认为机关汽车司机的工作不像产业工人那样连续劳动，每天八小时中平均开车的时间还不到一半，有必要加以改革。为了进一步做好自己的工作，他们在倡议书中并提出：保证随叫随到，不完成任务不休息；轮休时遇有任务照常上班；不迟到、不早退、不缺勤；全年安全行驶，不发生人身伤亡和责任事故。
    这些司机已从本月14日开始实行一班顶到底的办法。实行的结果感到人力有富裕，已有一名司机去学开锅驼机，现在他们正在研究进一步减少人员来支援建设的问题。
