    "Experts" so domineering
    According to Taiwan newspapers, American "experts" have extended their reach to all major economic departments of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, manipulating all economic power. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's financial budget must be approved by American "experts," and Taiwan's so-called "economic construction plans" must also be reviewed and approved by American "experts."

    Not long ago, a middle school building in central Taiwan was built with "US aid." Because the kitchen and toilets did not meet American standards, the American "expert" who came to inspect angrily cursed the teachers and students of the school as "pigs" and forced them to compensate for the construction costs of the school building.

    The Taiwan authorities recently held a "Forestry Conference." In addition to a few officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in charge of forestry, the rest of the participants were American "forestry experts." According to news reports, the American "experts" took a "dominant stance" at the meeting, insisting that the Taiwan authorities accept their "suggestions," forcing the officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "abandon the opinions or claims they should have expressed," causing these officials to feel "a sense of suffocation" inside.

    Taiwan newspapers say that the American "experts" in Taiwan "are only third- or fourth-rate characters," but they "actually strut around, considering themselves authorities, giving orders and forgetting themselves"; Taiwanese people with a little national self-esteem hold an attitude of "disgust" and "resentment" towards American "experts."

    The US military has a way of making money
    On Nongan Street, Zhongshan North Road, Taipei, there is a large-scale, modern "63" laundry shop. The owner is named Field, and he is a US Army major and the son-in-law of former US Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Kirk. Field's laundry does business with the US military as well as with Taiwanese residents. Under normal circumstances, the laundry's monthly turnover is 3,000 to 3,500 US dollars, but it has never paid business tax to the Taiwan authorities; moreover, all the laundry's real estate was seized from residents, and it has never paid rent or land rent.

    Since opening a shop in Taiwan is so profitable, even Field's father-in-law, former US Navy Admiral Kirk, was moved. As a director of the Ingos Taiwan Shipyard, he is engaged in shipbuilding in Taiwan. He not only demanded that the Taiwan authorities lend the company 8 to 9 million US dollars, but also that the company not pay income tax to the Taiwan authorities for three years after it officially started operations.

    Taiwan newspapers say that US military officers and soldiers are doing big business in Taiwan, and some Taiwanese merchants specialize in selling "private goods" shipped from the United States for members of the US advisory group. Therefore, some Taiwanese people say that the US military in Taiwan are "profiteers" who enjoy privileges.

    US military runs amok
    Before the Spring Festival, during the grand temple fairs in several areas of Taiwan, American soldiers frantically drove around in jeeps, throwing wine bottles at people, often getting out of the car to forcibly pull women to dance "cowboy" dances, or shouting wildly. Residents near the US military area in Keelung stay indoors whenever the US military receives their pay, fearing disaster. On the highway from downtown Taipei to the US military residential area, there are often tragic incidents of people being hit or killed by US military vehicles. Now the Taiwan authorities have designated this highway for the exclusive use of the US military. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    美国侵略者在台湾

    “专家”如此专横
    据台湾报纸透露，美国“专家”已伸展到台湾国民党的各个主要经济部门，操纵了一切经济大权。蒋介石集团的财政预算要征得美国“专家”同意，台湾的所谓“经济建设计划”也要由美国“专家”审查批准。
    不久以前，台湾中部用“美援”建筑了一所中学校舍，因为厨房和厕所不合美国标准，前来视察的美国“专家”竟怒骂这个学校的师生是“蠢猪”，并且胁迫赔偿建筑校舍的工程费。
    台湾当局最近召开了一次“林业会议”，参加这次会议的，除了蒋介石集团主管林业的少数官员以外，其余都是美国的“林业专家”。消息说，美国“专家”在会上以“喧宾夺主的姿态”，一定要台湾当局接受他们的“建议”，逼迫蒋介石集团的官员“放弃了其应当表示的意见或主张”，使这些官员内心都有“一股闷气”。
    台湾报纸说，在台湾的美国“专家”“不过以三、四流脚色充数”，却“居然高视阔步，以权威自命，颐指气使，忘其所以”；台湾稍有民族自尊心的人，对美国“专家”都抱着“厌恶”和“愤恨”的态度。
    美军生财有道
    台北中山北路农安街，有一家规模宏大、设备新颖的“六三”洗衣店。老板名叫菲尔德，他是一个美军少校，也是前美国第七舰队司令柯克上将的女婿。菲尔德的洗衣店既做美军的生意，也做台湾居民的生意。在通常情况下，这家洗衣店每月的营业额是三千至三千五百美元，但它从没有向台湾当局缴纳过营业税；而且洗衣店的全部房产都是霸占居民的，也从没有缴纳过房租和地租。
    在台湾开店既能如此发财，因而连菲尔德的岳父、前美国海军上将柯克也动了心。他以殷格斯公司台湾造船厂董事的身分，在台湾经营造船业。他不仅要挟台湾当局贷给这个公司八百万至九百万美元，而且在这个公司正式营业以后，三年不向台湾当局缴纳所得税。
    台湾报纸说，美军官兵在台湾大做生意，台湾的有些商人专替美军顾问团人员出售从美国运来的“私货”。因此，有的台湾老百姓说，在台湾的美军是享有特权的“奸商”。
    美军横冲直撞
    春节前，台湾好几个地区大拜拜（神会）时，美国兵丧心病狂地乘吉普车四处乱闯，酒瓶朝人乱丢，时常下车强拉女人跳“牛仔”舞，或者狂叫不已。在基隆美军驻区附近的居民，每逢美军发饷的一两天，都闭门不出，怕招来灾难。由台北市区通美军住宅区的公路上，经常发生有人被美军汽车撞倒或撞死的惨事，现在台湾当局已把这条公路划归美军专用。（新华社讯）（附图片）
