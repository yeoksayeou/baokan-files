    American Underworld

    Young Pirates
    Mr. Sears, a fifty-three-year-old American industrial capitalist, took his family of five aboard his luxurious private yacht, the "Fiesta II," to celebrate the New Year at sea as 1958 approached. On New Year's Eve, the yacht docked off the coast of Crowe Island in Florida.

    It was a clear, starry night when three pirates of similar appearance suddenly appeared on the yacht as the Sears family was admiring the beautiful scenery on the bow, raising pistols and aiming them at the night travelers' family:
    "Don't move, do as we say!"

    The three pirates were only forty-eight years old combined, but they spoke very fiercely:
    "We are going to Mexico immediately!"
    The yacht's owner successfully persuaded the pirates that enough fuel had to be prepared, and it was best to postpone the departure until the next day.

    So, under the coercion of the three teenage pirates, Sears steered the boat towards Islamorada Island. Sears' eldest son, David, took the opportunity to report to a sailor's office, and soon after, the police caught up with the yacht in a speedboat. At this time, the shorts-clad pirates had no choice but to throw their guns into the sea and surrender. The three were Mick Morley, seventeen; Johnny Cox, sixteen; and Tommy Edwards, fifteen. They had escaped from home in one of their fathers' cars. (Ning)

    少年海盗
    五十三岁的席亚斯先生是美国的一个工业资本家。在1958年新年到临之际，席亚斯携带了全家五口人，驾驶华丽的私人游艇“费也斯塔2号”，准备在海上欢度新年。除夕晚上，该艇在佛罗里达的克罗爱岛海岸停泊。
    这是一个星密风清之夜，正当席亚斯全家在艇首观赏美景之际，三个形状相似的海盗突然出现在这艘游艇上，并举起手枪对准夜游者的全家：
    “不许动，按我们说的去做！”
    三个海盗加起来才只有四十八岁，可是话讲得倒很厉害：
    “我们马上要到墨西哥去”！
    游艇的主人成功地说服了海盗们：必须准备足够的燃料，最好是推迟到第二天动身。
    于是席亚斯在三个少年海盗的挟持下，把船开往伊斯拉摩拉达岛。而席亚斯的大儿子大卫就利用这个机会到一个海员处报信，不久以后警察就乘摩托艇赶上了游艇。这个时候，这些短裤海盗们只好把枪投到海里而束手就擒。这三个人是米克·摩来，十七岁；琼尼·勾克斯，十六岁；托米·爱德华，十五岁。他们是乘坐其中一个人的父亲的汽车从家中逃出的。（宁）
