Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The headquarters and Beijing branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League jointly held a memorial meeting this afternoon to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the "February 28 Uprising" of the Taiwan people. The Taiwan compatriots in Beijing who attended the meeting unanimously denounced the US plot to create "two Chinas" in an attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan. All speakers were full of confidence that Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the motherland's big family.

The memorial meeting was presided over by Li Chunqing, vice chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Li Chunqing said that a kind mother will not abandon her children, and a strong motherland will not abandon her territory and people. The Taiwan people have only one motherland, and that is the People's Republic of China. Without her, Taiwan's future is a colony, and the fate of the Taiwan people is that of foreign slaves. The US plot to create "two Chinas" must be bankrupted. Because our motherland has become strong, the great leap forward in the motherland's socialist construction is also a great leap forward in the liberation of Taiwan. The international situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind is beneficial to our liberation of Taiwan. We firmly believe that the day of Taiwan's liberation is getting closer and closer.

Li Chunqing also refuted the fallacies spread by US imperialism, such as "trusteeship of Taiwan," "referendum," and "Taiwan autonomy."

Xie Nanguang, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, narrated the history of US aggression against Taiwan over the past 100 years at the meeting, and pointed out that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's participation in the US act of creating "two Chinas" and hostility towards China has aroused the opposition of the Japanese people. Xie Nanguang also pointed out: Patriotic Taiwan military and political figures must prevent being sold out by the United States. The only way out is to turn around and participate in the patriotic movement for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan; there is no second way out.

Tian Fuda (Gaoshan nationality), a representative of the National People's Congress, said at the meeting that the 200,000 Gaoshan people in Taiwan, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the US occupation of Taiwan and the plot to create "two Chinas."

Yang Chunsong, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Chen Wenbin, associate researcher of the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee, Wei Zhengming, president of Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and many overseas Chinese of Taiwanese origin who returned from Japan also spoke at the meeting.

More than 100 Taiwan compatriots in Beijing participated in the memorial meeting.

    国际形势大变化　祖国建设大跃进
    解放台湾的日子越来越近
    台盟总部纪念台湾人民“二·二八起义”十一周年
    据新华社27日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部和北京市支部，今天下午联合举行了台湾人民“二·二八起义”十一周年纪念会。到会的在京台湾同胞一致痛斥美国制造“两个中国”企图永远霸占台湾的阴谋。所有发言的人都充满信心地相信台湾一定能够回到祖国大家庭的怀胞。
    纪念会由台湾民主自治同盟副主席李纯青主持。李纯青说，慈祥的母亲不会丢掉她的孩子，强大的祖国不会放弃她的领土和人民。台湾人民的祖国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国。离开了她，台湾的前途就是殖民地，台湾人民的命运就是外国的奴隶。美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋一定要破产。因为我们的祖国已经强大起来了，祖国社会主义建设的大跃进，也就是解放台湾的大跃进。东风压倒西风的国际形势对我们解放台湾有利。我们深信台湾解放的日子已经愈来愈近。
    李纯青还驳斥美帝国主义散布的所谓“托管台湾”、“公民投票”、“台湾自治”等谬论。
    政协全国委员谢南光在会上叙述了一百年来美国侵略台湾的历史后指出，日本首相岸信介参预美国制造“两个中国”的敌视中国的行为，已经引起日本人民的反对。谢南光同时指出：具有爱国心的台湾军政界人士，要防止被美国出卖，只有掉转头来参加和平解放台湾的爱国运动，除此以外再也没有第二条出路。
    全国人民代表大会代表田富达（高山族）在会上说，台湾二十万高山族人民与全国人民一道，坚决反对美国霸占台湾和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    在会上发言的还有政协全国委员杨春松、中国文字改革委员会副研究员陈文彬、北京中医医院院长魏正明等和从日本归国的台湾籍华侨多人。
    参加纪念会的在京台湾同胞有一百多人。
