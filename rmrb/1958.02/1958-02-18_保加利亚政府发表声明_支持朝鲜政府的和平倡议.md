Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 16th: Newspapers here today published a statement issued by the Bulgarian government on the 14th, expressing full support for the proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The statement pointed out that these suggestions of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea embody the precious desire of the Korean people to reunify their artificially divided homeland and open up a practical and feasible path for a comprehensive solution to the Korean question, which has remained unresolved for twelve years.

The statement said that the Bulgarian people, like the people of Korea and all peace-loving people around the world, are equally concerned about the deteriorating situation in Korea. The U.S. side has consistently violated the armistice agreement, transported atomic weapons into South Korea, and U.S. and South Korean troops recently conducted atomic war exercises. The South Korean government has constantly issued war cries to re-attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—all of which have exacerbated the situation in Korea and threatened world peace. The statement pointed out that the main reason for exacerbating tensions in this region of the world and the fundamental obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea is the occupation of South Korea by U.S. troops. Therefore, the Bulgarian government believes that the most important prerequisite for the peaceful reunification of Korea and the elimination of the danger of a new war is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korean territory. The Government of the People's Republic of China has already announced its willingness to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. If other relevant countries also express the same desire, then it will be easier to reach an agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. The statement concluded by saying that the Bulgarian government hopes that all countries concerned with maintaining peace in the Far East and the world will assist in the peaceful resolution of the Korean question in the spirit of these suggestions.

### 保加利亚政府发表声明  支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议

    保加利亚政府发表声明
    支持朝鲜政府的和平倡议
    新华社索非亚16日电　今天这里的报纸刊载了保加利亚政府14日发表的声明，声明表示完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队、和平统一朝鲜的建议。
    声明指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府这些建议体现了朝鲜人民要求统一被人为地分裂着的祖国的宝贵愿望，打开了全面解决十二年来未能解决的朝鲜问题的切实可行的途径。
    声明说，由于朝鲜局势的日益恶化，保加利亚人民同朝鲜以及全世界爱好和平的人们感到同样的不安。美国方面一贯破坏停战协定，把原子武器运入南朝鲜，美国和南朝鲜军队不久前举行了原子战争演习，南朝鲜政府不断发出重新进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争叫嚣——所有这一切都加剧了朝鲜的局势，威胁着世界和平。声明指出，加剧世界这一地区紧张局势的主要原因与和平统一朝鲜的根本障碍是美国军队对南朝鲜的占领。因此保加利亚政府认为，和平统一朝鲜、从而消除爆发新战争危险的一个最重要的先决条件就是从朝鲜领土撤出一切外国军队。中华人民共和国政府已经宣布愿意从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军。如果其他有关国家也表示同样愿望的话，那么就从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队问题达成协议就容易了。声明最后指出，保加利亚政府希望所有关心维护远东和世界和平的国家本着这些建议的精神协助朝鲜问题的和平解决。
