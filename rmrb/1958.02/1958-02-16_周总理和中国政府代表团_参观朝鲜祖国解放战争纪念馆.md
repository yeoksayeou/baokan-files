Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th: Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government delegation he led, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung, visited the Korean Fatherland Liberation War Memorial Hall this morning.

The memorial hall has sixteen sections, displaying more than 3,600 exhibits, recording the great victories achieved by the Korean people in the war against the American aggressors.

After the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai wrote an inscription for the memorial hall as a souvenir. The inscription reads: "For the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle, the Korean people's heroes will be immortal. The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples will last forever."

Premier Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Zhang Wentian, and General Su Yu slowly walked through the various sections, carefully viewing the exhibits. They visited the sand table model of the Battle of Taejon, in which the Korean People's Army annihilated the U.S. 24th Infantry Division and captured its commander, Dean, in the early stages of the Korean War. Colored electric lights flashed on the model, indicating the victorious process of this major battle. Premier Zhou and his party then stopped in front of an anti-aircraft machine gun. The narrator told Premier Zhou that Kim Ki-u, a double hero of Korea, had used this machine gun to shoot down twelve enemy planes in one month. The narrator also pointed to a green-painted cannon and said that this cannon had killed or wounded more than 3,000 enemies, which attracted the attention of the visitors. This "Youth Guard" cannon had experienced the entire Korean War. When there were no vehicles to tow it, the gunners used manpower to pull it into battle. Premier Zhou and others also watched a statue of a People's Army telephone operator who, after being wounded, used his body to connect a broken telephone line, ensuring the victory of the battle. The heroic deeds and images of the Korean People's Army left a deep impression on the visitors.

Premier Zhou Enlai and others also visited the Chinese People's Volunteers section of the hall, viewing sand table models of battles such as Shangganling and Kumsong, and a statue of the hero Huang Jiguang. As they visited, they discussed the heroic deeds created by the Chinese and Korean people's armies with Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice Premier Nam Il, General Kim Kwang-hyup, and others who accompanied them.

The exhibits in the hall strongly illustrated the deep friendship forged between the Chinese and Korean peoples in battle. Premier Zhou Enlai stared at an oil painting for a long time. The oil painting depicts a Korean farmer encountering an enemy plane bombing while rushing to transport wounded Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers during the Shangganling Campaign. He sacrificed himself by lying on the wounded soldiers to protect them. Premier Zhou Enlai also viewed the stretcher used by the martyr Park Jae-geun, which was on display here. Premier Zhou Enlai praised this respectable Korean farmer in his speech yesterday. Also on display were a wooden basin and a broken earthenware pot. Premier Kim Il-sung introduced to Premier Zhou Enlai that these were the things used by the Korean people to deliver food to the Volunteers during the Battle of Flying Tiger Mountain, braving artillery fire. At that time, more than 30 Koreans sacrificed themselves to get the food up the mountain, but in the end, the Korean people finally delivered the food to the Volunteers. The Chinese guests also saw a very familiar oil painting, depicting a Korean child falling into the water and a Volunteer immediately jumping into the water, saving the Korean child but sacrificing his own life. This is the story of the internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, which is widely circulated among the Chinese and Korean peoples.

After the visit, the Chinese guests led by Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung and others took a group photo with the generals of the Korean People's Army in front of the memorial hall.

    周总理和中国政府代表团
    参观朝鲜祖国解放战争纪念馆
    新华社平壤15日电　周恩来总理和他率领的中国政府代表团由金日成首相陪同在今天上午参观了朝鲜祖国解放战争纪念馆。
    这个纪念馆有十六个分馆，陈列着三千六百多件展品，纪录着朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略者的战争中所取得的伟大胜利。
    周恩来总理在参观以后为纪念馆题词留念。题词是：“为反帝国主义斗争的胜利，朝鲜人民英雄永垂不朽。朝中两国人民的战斗友谊万古长存”。
    周恩来总理、陈毅、张闻天和粟裕大将缓步走过各个分馆，仔细地观看了陈列的展品。他们参观了朝鲜战争初期朝鲜人民军歼灭美军第二十四师，活捉师长迪安的大田战役的沙盘模型。彩色的电炬在模型上闪耀着，标示着这次重大的战役取得胜利的过程。周总理一行接着在一挺高射机关枪前面停留了下来。解说员告诉周总理说，朝鲜双重英雄金基禹曾经使用这挺机枪在一个月中击落敌机十二架。解说员还指着一门涂着绿色油漆的大炮说，这门大炮曾经杀伤了三千多名敌人，他的话引起了参观者的注意。这门“民青号”大炮曾经经历了整个朝鲜战争的过程。炮手们在没有汽车牵引时曾经用人拉着它进行战斗。周总理等还观看了一个人民军电话员的塑像，这个电话员在负伤以后用自己的身体把断了的电话线连接起来，保证了战斗的胜利。朝鲜人民军的英雄事迹和形象给了参观者很深的印象。
    周恩来总理等还参观了馆内的志愿军分馆，观看了上甘岭、金城等战役的沙盘模型和黄继光英雄的塑像。他们一面参观一面和陪同参观的金日成首相、南日副首相、金光侠大将等谈论着朝中人民军队创造的英雄事迹。
    馆内的陈列品强烈地说明了朝中两国人民在战斗中结成的深厚友谊。周恩来总理在一幅油画前凝视了很久。这幅油画描绘一个朝鲜农民在上甘岭战役中抢运中国人民志愿军伤员时遭遇敌机轰炸，他用自己的身体伏在伤员身上掩护伤员而牺牲了自己。周恩来总理还观看了陈列在这里的朴在根烈士使用的担架。周恩来总理昨天在讲话中曾经赞誉过这位可敬的朝鲜农民。这里还陈列着一个木盆和一个破了的瓦罐。金日成首相向周恩来总理介绍说，这是志愿军在飞虎山作战时朝鲜人民冒着炮火给志愿军送饭用的东西。当时为了把饭送上山去曾经牺牲了三十多个朝鲜人，但是最后朝鲜人民终于把饭送给了志愿军。中国客人们还看到了一幅很熟悉的油画，油画上描绘着一个朝鲜儿童落到水里，一个志愿军立即跳下水去，他救活了朝鲜儿童而牺牲了自己的生命。这就是在中朝两国人民中间广泛流传的国际主义战士罗盛教的故事。
    参观完了以后，以周恩来总理为首的中国客人们和金日成首相等，同朝鲜人民军的将领在纪念馆前合影留念。
