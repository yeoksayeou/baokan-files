When you have a watch, how do you judge its quality? How do you maintain it? What do you do when minor problems arise? Is a "diving watch" forever waterproof? Here's some common knowledge about using watches.

Q: Does a louder ticking sound indicate better quality?

A: Generally speaking, the louder the ticking sound, the lower the quality of the watch. Watches with rough movements lack diamond bearings on the escapement (a major part inside the watch) and instead use solid steel wires, causing the balance wheel to make a loud, heavy sound when it rotates. Watches with fine movements have two diamond bearings on the escapement, and the balance wheel makes a very slight sound when it rotates. Some watches with better waterproofing even have balance wheel rotations that are barely audible.

While the ticking sound cannot determine the quality of the watch, it can help determine if there are problems with the installation of the movement or if the balance staff has been damaged during transport or storage. The method is: hold the watch in one hand, first listen with the dial facing up, then with the dial facing down, then stand it up with 12 o'clock facing up, 12 o'clock facing down, 3 o'clock facing up, 3 o'clock facing down, tilted facing up, and tilted facing down. If the sound is always "dang, dang, dang," the same size, and without any noise, it is called a watch that "runs in all directions" and is a good watch without problems.

Q: Can waterproof watches be worn for swimming? Can shockproof watches be worn for playing ball? Can antimagnetic watches be tested on a magnet?

A: No, you can't. Waterproof watches can only prevent water vapor in the air from entering, as well as water droplets splashed on them by accident when it rains or when washing your face. The reason why our country signs import contracts for "waterproof watches" instead of "diving watches" for foreign trade is precisely this. "Diving watch" was a deceptive advertisement used by capitalists in the past to earn high profits. In the hot summer, suddenly jumping into the water with a watch on, the watch will be subjected to water pressure, plus thermal expansion and contraction, and even the best waterproof equipment cannot prevent water from entering. However, usually very little water enters, which is not immediately noticeable, and after three to five days, a layer of small water droplets can be seen on the surface glass. Although very little water enters, it also has a rusting effect on the movement. In addition, there are rubber rings between the watch cover and the case, and between the surface glass and the case. If they are frequently exposed to water, the rubber rings will rot, and eventually they will lose their waterproof function. In summer, arms are prone to sweating, and many people use plastic backing to put on the watch, which is beneficial to protecting the watch.

Shockproof watches have better shock resistance than ordinary watches, but they are still afraid of severe shocks. Because shockproof watches have two springs at both ends of the balance staff, ordinary shocks will not break the balance staff. However, severe shocks will not only break the balance staff, but also damage other parts. Therefore, it is best to take off the watch when playing ball or doing physical labor.

The antimagnetic performance of antimagnetic watches is generally not very good. Therefore, watches should not be placed on radios or near motors, generators, or electricity meters, because radios, motors, etc. have magnets and coils, which will magnetize the watch and affect the accuracy of its timekeeping.

Q: Why do watches need to be cleaned and oiled?

A: The purpose of cleaning and oiling is to wash away the dirt on the movement and apply new oil to protect the movement. A new waterproof watch, as long as the cover has not been opened, only needs to be cleaned and oiled every two or three years, or even longer. It is unfounded to say that it needs to be cleaned and oiled once a year. Of course, watches without waterproofing equipment need to be cleaned and oiled more frequently.

The most prominent sign of a watch that needs to be cleaned and oiled is that it runs slower and slower, and sometimes stops after only five or six hours when fully wound. At this time, you should immediately find a watch repair technician to check it. If you don't clean and oil it immediately, in addition to affecting the accuracy of timekeeping, more importantly, it affects the service life of the balance staff. The balance staff moves four times per second, more than 30,000 times a day and night. After a certain period of time, the oil on the balance staff will run out. At this time, the friction increases, the rust prevention ability decreases, and the balance staff will soon break.

Q: Can the surface dial be prevented from darkening and turning black?

A: The chemical "Axitong" is coated on the surface dial. It is easily oxidized, especially after moisture enters the watch, the oxidation will accelerate, and thus it will gradually darken and turn black. In addition, sunlight will also cause the dial to fade and darken. Therefore, to protect the dial, the watch should not be exposed to moisture, and should not be exposed to the hot sun in summer.

### 当你有了手表以后

　　当你有了手表以后
    当你有了手表以后，怎样判断它的质量？怎样保养？有了小毛病怎么办？“游泳表”是不是永远可以防水？……这里给你介绍一些使用手表的常识。
    问：手表走动的声音越大，是否说明质量越好？
    答：一般说来，走动声音越大，手表的质量越次。机件粗糙的手表因骑马（表内一个主要零件）上没有钻石轴承，仅有立体式钢丝代替钻石，因而摆轮转动时发音很粗重。机件精细的手表，因骑马上装有两个骑马钻石，摆轮转动的声音很轻微。还有些防水设备比较好的手表，摆轮转动的声音甚至听不出来。
    从手表走动的声音虽然不能判断表的质量，但是却可以判断机件安装是否有毛病，以及在运输保管中是否震坏了摆尖。听的方法是：用一只手拿着表，先将盘面朝上听，再盘面朝下听，然后立起12点朝上，12点朝下，3点朝上，3点朝下，偏着朝上，偏着朝下，如果声音都是当当当，大小一样，没有杂音，这就叫一只“能走八方”的手表，是一只没有毛病的好表。
    问：防水手表是否可以戴着游泳？防震手表是否可以戴着打球？防磁手表是否可以在磁石上试一下？
    答：不可以。防水手表只能防空气中的水蒸汽的侵入，下雨天以及洗脸时不小心溅上的水滴。我国对外贸易签订进口合同时称防水表，而不称游泳表，正是这个道理。“游泳表”是过去资本家为赚取高额利润的一种欺骗宣传。在炎热的夏天，戴着手表骤然跳下水去，由于手表受到水的压力，再加上热涨冷缩，防水设备再好也不能防止进水。不过通常是进水极微，马上觉察不出来，过三、五天之后，就可以在表面玻璃上看到一层小水珠。水虽然进的很少，对机件也有锈腐作用。另外，表盖和表壳之间，表面玻璃和表壳之间都有橡皮圈，如果经常沾水，橡皮圈便会腐烂，到一定时候便会失去防水的作用。夏天手臂易出汗，许多人用塑胶底托套在表上，这对保护手表是有益的。
    防震手表的防震性能比普通手表好一些，但也怕剧烈震动。因为防震表在摆尖两端安有两个弹簧，一般震动不会把摆尖震断。然而剧烈震动，不仅摆尖会被震断，其它机件也会受到损伤。所以，打球或从事体力劳动时，最好把手表摘下来。
    防磁手表的防磁性能，一般并不很好。所以，手表不应放在收音机上，或靠近马达、发电机、电表处，因为收音机、马达等等都有磁石和线圈，会把磁过到表上，影响表走时的准确性。
    问：手表为什么要洗油？
    答：洗油的目的是，洗掉机件上的油垢，另涂上新油，保护机件。一块新的防水表，只要没开过表盖，二、三年或者更多一些时间才需洗油。有人说每年都得洗一次油，是没有根据的。当然，没有防水设备的手表，洗油时间就需勤一些。
    该洗油的手表，最突出的象征是越走越慢，有时上足弦走五、六小时便停了。这时就应立即找修表技师检查一下。该洗油而不马上洗，除了影响走时准确以外，更重要的是影响摆尖的使用寿命。摆尖每秒钟要走动四下，一天一夜要走动三万多下，到一定时期，摆尖上的油就会耗光，这时磨擦力加大，防锈能力减少，摆尖很快就会断掉。问：能使表面字盘不发暗变黑吗？
    答：表面字盘上涂有化学药品“阿雪通”，它很易被氧化，尤其水气侵入表内以后，氧化更会加快，因而便逐渐发暗变黑。此外，阳光照射也会使字盘退色变暗。因此，要保护字盘，就要不使手表受潮，在夏季不要在烈日下曝晒。
