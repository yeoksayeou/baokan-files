Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 27th: Shanghai's literary and art circles are launching a movement against waste and conservatism, focusing their fierce attacks on backward ideas and systems that restrict creative and performance potential, demanding that literary and artistic creation and performance rapidly and massively reflect the myriad phenomena of the Great Leap Forward era, and further promote the great development of production.

The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Writers Association posted more than 800 big-character posters in a single day on the 26th. Writers Jin Yi, Jun Qing, Luo Sun, and others posted seven, eight, or even more than ten posters each. Many big-character posters criticized the lethargy and indolence existing among writers. One big-character poster criticized a writer: "As a professional writer, you don't consider creating much. Anyway, you don't have to worry about life, and you just procrastinate when it comes to writing." Another big-character poster criticized Jun Qing for never stepping into a factory gate in the several years he has been in Shanghai. Various theaters and troupes under the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture posted more than 4,200 big-character posters in four hours on the afternoon of the 26th.

The work plans formulated by various units have been constantly broken through and revised again and again in the torrent of opposing waste and conservatism. The three feature film studios under the Shanghai Film Studio originally planned to produce 23 films this year, but this has now been revised to 35. After mass discussion, it is believed that efforts can be made to reach 38. Tianma Film Studio proposed reducing the cost of each film from an average of 220,000 yuan last year to 150,000 yuan, and shortening the production time of each film from 230 days last year to 150 days. The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Musicians Association originally proposed creating 150 mass songs per month, but in February, more than 200 songs have already been created, exceeding the original target by more than one-third.

Under the rising revolutionary enthusiasm, the routines of many units have been broken. Tianma Film Studio decided to adopt two shifts, day and night, for cross-shooting to overcome the difficulty of insufficient studios. Many theaters don't have enough scripts, so they adopted the method of screenwriters, directors, and leading actors working together to research and create, greatly shortening the scriptwriting time. The Shanghai Song and Dance Troupe criticized the idea that there is a contradiction between performance and creation. While touring factories and villages, they are also creating, and have now created 22 new songs and 14 dances. They also plan to increase the number of performances this year tenfold compared to last year, reaching 1,100.

Many people in Shanghai's literary and art circles have formulated personal plans and are striving to become both red and expert. More than 50 writers have already formulated plans. Many writers have gone down to factories, the countryside, and the armed forces.

    迅速大量地反映大跃进时代的万千气象
    上海文艺界大反暮气和懒气
    据新华社上海27日电　上海文学艺术界正在通过反浪费反保守的运动，向一切束缚创作和演出潜力的落后思想和制度集中猛攻，要求文艺创作和演出能迅速而大量地反映大跃进时代的万千气象，进一步促进生产大发展。
    中国作家协会上海分会26日一天内贴出了大字报八百多张，作家靳以、峻青、罗荪等都贴了七、八张到十多张。许多大字报批评作家中存在的暮气和懒气。有一张大字报批评一位作家：“身为专业作家，考虑创作不多，反正生活不愁，写作不推就拖”。另一张大字报批评峻青到上海几年来，从来未进入工厂大门一步。上海市文化局所属的各个剧院和剧团，26日下午四个多小时内就贴出了四千二百多张大字报。
    各单位订出的工作规划，在反浪费反保守巨流中已经不断地被冲破，一次再次地修改。上海电影制片公司所属三个故事片厂，原来计划今年摄制影片二十三部，现在已修改为三十五部，经过群众讨论，认为还可以向三十八部努力。天马电影制片厂提出每部影片的成本从去年平均二十二万元降低到十五万元，每部影片的生产时间从去年的二百三十天缩短到一百五十天。中国音乐家协会上海分会原提出每月创作群众歌曲一百五十个，但是2月已经创作了二百多个，超过了原指标三分之一多。
    在高涨的革命干劲下，许多单位的常规被打破了。天马电影制片厂决定采取日夜两班交叉拍摄，克服摄影棚不够用的困难。许多剧院的剧本不够，就采取编剧、导演和主要演员一起研究创作，大大缩短编剧时间。上海歌舞团批判了认为演出和创作有矛盾的思想，一面在工厂、农村巡回演出，一面创作，现在已创作新歌二十二首，舞蹈十四个。他们还打算把今年的演出场数比去年增加十倍，达到一千一百场。
    上海文艺界许多人已经订出个人规划，向又红又专的方向努力。作家中订出规划的已有五十多人。许多作家已下厂、下乡、下部队。
