　　Leningrad filmmakers recently produced a new feature film, "Immortal Road." The film introduces the life of the Czechoslovak national hero Julius Fučík (1903-1943) from his arrest by the fascist German secret police to his death sentence. Most of the events in the film take place in Prague's Pankrác Prison, where Fučík wrote "Report from the Gallows." The film ends with the book's conclusion, "People, I loved you! Be vigilant!"

　　The art film "Oath of the Rebels," written by the famous Bulgarian writer Vassilev, has recently been released in Bulgarian cinemas. This film depicts the heroic struggle of the Balkan and Hungarian people against the Turkish conquerors in the eighteenth century.

　　The protagonist of the film, the rebel militia commander Strashil, is a fighter who liberates his compatriots, but he abandons the cause of the people for his personal happiness, and thus loses the trust of the people. Although he has a family, he is lonely. Later, he returns to the people and to the struggle, and only then does he find true happiness again.

　　The Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently jointly produced a color feature film "Brothers" for the first time.

　　The film depicts the struggle of the Korean people to rebuild their country after the war, unfolding a moving plot through the changes of two brothers. One brother participated in the Korean National Liberation War, while the other, growing up in South Korea, was deeply influenced by enemy ideology. Only after he returned to Democratic Korea did he discover the truth about the new social system.

　　Two young directors from the Moscow Film Studio recently wrote and directed a short film called "Fragments of a Story." This film is adapted from Sholokhov's short story "The Fate of a Man," which describes the Patriotic War. Soviet People's Artist Bondarchuk plays the protagonist Sokolov.

　　The film has now been successfully produced. In this film, Bondarchuk once again showed his talent, creating the image of an ordinary, heroic Soviet soldier. Not long ago, Sholokhov watched this film, and he said to the directors and actors: "Andrei Sokolov, the protagonist of the novel I imagined, is exactly like this." (Attached picture)

　　伏契克的形象搬上银幕  萧洛霍夫新作拍成电影
    列宁格勒电影工作者最近摄制了一部新的故事片“不朽的道路”。影片介绍了捷克斯洛伐克民族英雄尤利乌斯·伏契克
  （1903年到1943年）从被法西斯德国的秘密警察逮捕到被判死刑期间的生活。影片中大部分事件发生在布拉格潘克拉茨监狱，伏契克在这个监狱里写了“绞刑架下的报告”，影片最后以这本书的结语“人们，我是爱你们的！你们可要警惕啊！”结束。
    保加利亚著名作家华西列夫编的艺术影片“起义者的誓言”最近已在保加利亚各电影院上映。这部影片是描写十八世纪巴尔干和匈牙利人民反对土耳其征服者的英勇斗争事迹的。
    影片中的主角——起义民兵将领斯特拉希尔是一个解放本国同胞的战士，但是他为了个人幸福而放弃了全民的事业，因此也就丧失了人民的信任。他虽然有了一个家庭，但是他是孤独的。后来他回到人民中，回到斗争中，才重新找到了真正的幸福。
    苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最近第一次合摄了一部彩色故事片“兄弟”。
    影片描写战后的朝鲜人民为重建祖国而作的斗争，通过两兄弟的变化展开了动人的情节。这两兄弟一个参加了朝鲜民族解放战争，而另一个由于生长在南朝鲜，深受敌人的思想侵蚀，直到他回到民主朝鲜后，才发觉新社会制度的真相。
    莫斯科电影制片厂的两位青年导演最近编导了一部名叫“小说片断”的短片。这部片子是根据萧洛霍夫描写卫国战争的短篇小说“一个人的遭遇”改编的。苏联人民演员邦达丘克担任主角索科洛夫。
    现在影片已经摄制成功。在这部影片中，邦达丘克再一次表现了他的天才，创造了一个普通的、英雄的苏联士兵的形象。不久前，萧洛霍夫看了这部影片，他对导演和演员说：“我所想像中的小说主角，安德烈·索科洛夫正是这个样子。”（附图片）
