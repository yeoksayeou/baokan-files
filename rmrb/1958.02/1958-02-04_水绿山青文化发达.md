　　Green Waters, Green Mountains, Developed Culture
　　Writing Letters and Calculating Accounts No Longer Requires Asking for Help
　　The Shipowan Agricultural Cooperative in Lingbao County, Henan Province, located amidst mountain ranges and surrounded by high mountains, has sixty-eight households. In the past, only three people were literate, one having attended school for eight days, and two having attended elementary school for two years. People had to travel over mountains and ridges to places fifteen miles away to ask for help reading letters and keeping accounts. The literacy campaigns of the past few years since liberation have changed this culturally backward situation. Now, more than sixty farmers have graduated from people's schools, and they are responsible for the cooperative's work recording, letter writing, and accounting, no longer needing to travel over mountains and ridges to ask for help. Currently, another forty-five farmers continue to participate in spare-time elementary school studies. They excitedly say, our mountain area is no longer a culturally backward place! (Yan Weijun)
　　No Shortage of Work Recorders Now
　　Xiaochang Township in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, is a mountainous area surrounded by mountains and with dispersed residences. Before liberation, it was not only economically poor but also culturally very backward. The entire township had only one elementary school, and over 95% of the young and middle-aged people were illiterate. In the early days of establishing agricultural cooperatives after liberation, they couldn't even find a single work recorder. Therefore, farmers urgently demanded to learn to read and write.
　　Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, literacy campaigns have been launched since 1952. Farmers have actively enrolled in winter schools to learn to read, and young farmers have also transferred to regular people's school studies. By the end of 1957, out of 697 young people in the township, 634 were literate, accounting for 90.8% of the total number of young people. According to the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, illiteracy among young people was eliminated ten years ahead of schedule.

　　Farmers Attend Junior High School
　　Bali Township in Ankang County is located in the southern Shaanxi mountainous area. For eight years, under the leadership of the Party, farmers throughout the township, through hard work, have fundamentally changed the face of the mountain area. Now, it is not only green mountains and clear waters, but also cultural undertakings have experienced rapid development. In addition to the 307 farmers throughout the township who have eliminated illiteracy and taken on various jobs, last winter, the township also newly established a spare-time junior high school class, six senior elementary school classes, fifteen people's schools, and thirty-six literacy groups, with 1,447 people enrolled, exceeding the number of people who should be enrolled in the township by 16.5%. The township was therefore rated as a model township for literacy elimination in the county. (Zhang Yongling)

　　水绿山青文化发达
    写信算账不再求人
    山岭纵横高山环抱的河南省灵宝县石坡湾农业社，有六十八户人家，过去只有三个人识字，一人上过八天学，二人上过二年初小。人们看信记账总是要翻山越岭到十五里以外的地方去求人。解放几年来的扫盲运动，改变了这种文化落后的面貌。现在已经有六十多个农民从民校毕了业，农业社的记工、写信、算账都由他们来担任，不再翻山越岭去求人了。现在还有四十五个农民继续参加业余小学学习。他们兴奋地说，我们山区再不是文化落后的地方了。（严维钧）
    如今不缺记工员
    河北遵化县小厂乡是个群山环绕、居住分散的山区。解放前不仅经济上贫困，文化上也非常落后，全乡只有一所小学，95％以上的青壮年都是文盲。解放后，建立农业社的初期，连一个记工员也找不出。因此，农民迫切要求学习文化。
    在党和人民政府的领导下，从1952年起就开展了扫盲运动，农民纷纷入冬学识字，青年农民还转入了正常的民校学习。到1957年止，全乡六百九十七个青年，识字的有六百三十四人，占青年总数的90.8％。按全国农业发展纲要修正草案的规定要求，提前十年扫除了青年人中的文盲。（共青团遵化县委会）
    农民上初中念书
    安康县八里乡位于陕南山区。八年以来，全乡农民在党的领导下，经过辛勤的劳动，已经从根本上改变了山区的面貌。现在，不仅是青山绿水，而且文化事业也有了飞跃的发展。全乡除三百零七名农民扫除了文盲，担任了各方面的工作外，去年冬天，这个乡还新办了一所业余初中班，六所高小班，民校十五处，识字组三十六处，一千四百四十七人入了学，超过全乡应入学的人数16.5％。这个乡因此被评为全县扫盲模范乡。　（张永龄）
