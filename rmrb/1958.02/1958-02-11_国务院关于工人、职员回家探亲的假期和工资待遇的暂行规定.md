    Provisional Regulations of the State Council on Vacation and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff Returning Home to Visit Relatives
    (Approved in principle by the 85th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on November 16, 1957)
    (Revised and adopted by the 70th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on February 6, 1958)
    Article 1. These provisional regulations are formulated to appropriately address the issue of workers and staff living far from their hometowns and separated from their families returning home to visit relatives.
    Article 2. The term "returning home to visit relatives" as used in these regulations refers only to workers and staff returning home to visit their fathers, mothers, and spouses. Formal workers and staff who have worked continuously for one year or more in state-owned or joint state-private enterprises, institutions, state organs, and people's organizations, and who do not live with their fathers, mothers, or spouses and are unable to reunite with them by using public holidays, may enjoy the benefits of these regulations.
    Article 3. Workers and staff who already have their fathers, mothers, or spouses living with them at their place of work, or workers and staff who live relatively close to home and can reunite with their fathers, mothers, or spouses by using public holidays, or workers and staff who enjoy other paid continuous vacations of two weeks or more each year, shall not enjoy the benefits of these regulations.
    If both husband and wife are workers and staff, working separately in different locations and unable to reunite by using public holidays, even if both have their fathers and mothers living with them at their respective work locations, one of them may be allowed to enjoy the benefits of these regulations. Workers and staff who work in the same location as their father or mother but whose spouse is in another location and unable to reunite by using public holidays may also be allowed to enjoy the benefits of these regulations.
    Article 4. Workers and staff returning home to visit relatives shall, in principle, be granted leave once a year. The length of the vacation shall be determined based on the distance of the journey, and shall be two to three weeks (including public holidays, the same below). If, due to work needs, the administrative side cannot grant leave to certain workers and staff in the current year, the consent of the grassroots trade union organization should be obtained, and leave of four to five weeks should be granted in the next year. For certain workers and staff whose work locations are too far from home and whose travel time back and forth requires more than ten days, leave may be granted once every two years, with a vacation of five to six weeks. No additional travel leave will be granted beyond the above-mentioned vacations.
    Article 5. Workers and staff shall be paid wages for their home visit vacation according to their hourly wage standard.
    Article 6. The round-trip transportation costs for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives shall, in principle, be borne by the individual. If the individual has genuine difficulties in bearing the costs, the administrative side of the unit where the worker or staff is located may provide appropriate subsidies. The subsidy methods shall be stipulated in the implementing rules.
    Article 7. The administrative side of each enterprise, institution, state organ, and people's organization should, in conjunction with the grassroots trade union organization, reasonably arrange the home visit vacations for workers and staff, striving not to hinder the normal progress of production and work, and shall not increase staffing levels as a result.
    Article 8. The People's Committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government may formulate implementing rules based on these regulations, and uniformly implement them within their respective province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government. The implementing rules for the railway and shipping systems shall be formulated by their respective central competent departments and implemented within their respective departments, and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Labor for the record.
    Article 9. These regulations shall also apply to supply and marketing cooperatives, but shall not apply to schools, handicraft production cooperatives, transportation cooperatives, and joint state-private enterprises with undetermined interest rates.
    Article 10. These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定
    （1957年11月16日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八十五次会议原则批准）
    （1958年2月6日国务院全体会议第七十次会议修改通过）
    第一条　为了适当地解决远离家乡同家属分居两地的工人、职员回家探亲的问题，制定本暂行规定。
    第二条　本规定所称的回家探亲，只是指工人、职员回家探望父亲、母亲和配偶。在国营、公私合营的企业、事业单位和国家机关、人民团体中连续工作满一年的正式工人、职员，同父亲、母亲、配偶都不住在一起而又不能够利用公共休假日回家团聚的，可以享受本规定的待遇。
    第三条　凡是在本人工作地点已经有父亲或者母亲或者配偶住在一起的工人、职员，或者离家较近能够利用公共休假日与父亲、母亲、配偶团聚的工人、职员，或者每年享有其他领取工资的连续两个星期以上的假期的工人、职员，都不享受本规定的待遇。
    夫妇双方都是工人、职员，分别在两地工作而又不能够利用公共休假日团聚的，即使双方在工作地点都已经有父亲、母亲同住，可以允许一方享受本规定的待遇。工人、职员与父亲或者母亲同在一地工作而配偶在外地又不能够利用公共休假日团聚的，也允许享受本规定的待遇。
    第四条　工人、职员回家探亲，原则上每年给假一次。假期根据路程的远近，规定为两个星期至三个星期（包括公共休假日在内，下同）。如果因为工作需要，行政方面对于某些工人、职员当年不能够给予假期，应该取得工会基层组织的同意，在下一个年度合并给假四个星期至五个星期。某些工人、职员的工作地点离家太远，旅途往返所需用的时间在十日以上的，可以每两年给假一次，假期为五个星期至六个星期。除了上述假期以外，不另给路程假。
    第五条　工人、职员回家探亲的假期，按照本人的计时工资标准发给工资。
    第六条　工人、职员回家探亲所需用的往返车船费，原则上由本人自理，如果本人自理确有困难的时候，由工人、职员所在单位的行政方面酌予补助，补助办法在实施细则中规定。
    第七条　各企业、事业单位和国家机关、人民团体的行政方面应该会同工会基层组织，合理地安排工人、职员回家探亲的假期，务求不妨碍生产和工作的正常进行，并且不得因此而增加人员编制。
    第八条　各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会可以根据本规定制定实施细则，在本省、自治区、直辖市范围内统一执行；铁道、航运系统的实施细则各由其中央主管部门制定，在本部门范围内执行，都报送劳动部备案。
    第九条　本规定同样适用于供销合作社，但是不适用于学校、手工业生产合作社、运输合作社和未定息的公私合营企业。
    第十条　本规定自发布之日起施行。
