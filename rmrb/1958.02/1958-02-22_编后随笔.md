    Editor's Notes
    The news that the Luoyang Machinery Factory and the Yuqi Iron Factory have trial-produced small tractors has once again opened our eyes. In the past, whenever tractors were mentioned, or agricultural mechanization was mentioned, we thought of the large-scale Luoyang Tractor Factory under construction, and felt that only by building many such factories could the rural areas of the whole country use iron oxen to cultivate the land. In this way, we always felt that the realization of agricultural mechanization was a relatively distant problem. Now, the two very poor, very old, and very small factories in Luoyang and Yuqi have manufactured tractors that are both cheap and suitable. It has changed our old concept, and the "long-term vision" of agricultural mechanization has become a "near-term vision" that is very promising to be realized in a relatively short period of time. This change once again illustrates a truth: in our society, relying on the conscious labor of the working masses, old machines can be used to create many unexpected miracles!

    编后随笔
    洛阳机械厂和玉溪铁工厂试制小型拖拉机的消息，又一次打开了我们的眼界。过去，一提起制造拖拉机，一提起农业机械化，就想到正在兴建中的规模宏大的洛阳拖拉机制造厂，觉得只有新建很多个这样的工厂，才能让全国农村都用铁牛耕地。这样，就总觉得实现农业机械化是个比较遥远的问题。现在，洛阳和玉溪的两个很穷、很旧、很小的工厂，制造出又便宜又适用的拖拉机来了。它改变了我们的旧观念，农业机械化的“远景”变成了很有希望在比较短的时间内实现的“近景”。这个变化，再次说明了一个真理：在我们的社会里，依靠工人群众的自觉劳动，可以用旧机器创造出许多意想不到的奇迹来！
