To the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress:

The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress, held from June 26 to July 15, 1957, entrusted the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to handle the issue of revoking the qualifications as deputies to the National People's Congress and other positions of rightists, depending on the circumstances. The following proposal is now made on this issue:

(1) Prior to this session, the rightists whose qualifications as deputies to the National People's Congress had been formally revoked by their original electoral units include Qian Duansheng, Shen Zhiyuan, Yang Yitang, Jiang Feng, Liu Lanqi, Sha Wenhan, Yang Siyi, Wang Guosong, Li Shihao, Song Yunbin, Yao Shunfu, Feng Xuefeng, Zeng Zhaolun, Xiang De, Tan Tiwu, and Lei Tianjue, sixteen in total. Among them, Qian Duansheng's position as a member of the Bills Committee of the National People's Congress and Zeng Zhaolun's position as a member of the Budget Committee of the National People's Congress are naturally revoked along with the revocation of their qualifications as deputies.

(2) Regarding the qualifications as deputies of the rightists Zhang Naiqi, Pan Dakui, Zeng Shufan, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, Huang Xianfan, Fei Zhendong, Qiao Chuanjue, Ma Zhemin, Zhang Bojun, Ye Duyi, Cheng Shifan, Pan E’bo, Luo Longji, Fei Xiaotong, Chu Anping, Qian Weichang, Qian Sunqing, Ou Baichuan, Wang Tianxi, Han Zhaoe, Ding Ling, Zhang Dongmu, Xie Xuehong, Yang Ziheng, Zheng Lizhai, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Xu Zhucheng, Huang Yaomian, Wang Yizhai, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Yunchuan, Zhu Junyun, Bi Mingqi, Tan Zhiqing, Long Yun, and Li Zuoan, thirty-eight in total, the Credentials Committee has submitted a proposal to the Congress, stating that they have lost the legal basis to continue performing their duties as deputies to the National People's Congress and should not attend the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress. Therefore, the Standing Committee has decided to recommend that the Congress remove Huang Shaohong, Long Yun, and Chen Mingshu from their positions as members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, remove Fei Xiaotong, Huang Xianfan, and Ou Baichuan from their positions as members of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, remove Zhang Yunchuan, Chen Mingshu, Huang Shaohong, Huang Qixiang, Xie Xuehong, and Luo Longji from their positions as members of the Bills Committee of the National People's Congress, remove Long Yun from his position as Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Council, and remove Huang Qixiang from his position as a member of the National Defense Council.

    第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议：
    一九五七年六月二十六日至七月十五日举行的全国人民代表大会第四次会议，曾经把关于撤销右派分子全国人民代表大会代表资格和其他职务问题，交由全国人民代表大会常务委员会酌量情况处理。现在就这个问题提出建议如下：
