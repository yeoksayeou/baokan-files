    Good Planting in the Experimental Fields of Cadres in Bengbu and Wuhu Special Districts
    New Changes in Cadre Style and Farming Habits
    Kunming Municipal Party Committee Calls on Rural Work Cadres to Do Well in Experimental Fields
    (Our report) The leading cadres at all levels in Bengbu and Wuhu Special Districts, Anhui Province, generally attach importance to the work of planting experimental fields. During last year's autumn planting, the county, district, township and commune leading cadres in Bengbu Special District planted more than 13,000 mu of experimental fields. These experimental fields broke the local old habits of not applying winter fertilizer or winter irrigation to autumn-sown crops, and generally carried out topdressing, winter irrigation, and weeding, so the wheat seedlings grew strong and healthy. As a result, Shagou Township, Huaiyuan County, also changed its past habit of not applying winter fertilizer and applied fertilizer to the wheat fields. Sun Dongfu, a cadre in the township, was a student and did not understand production. After planting experimental fields, he learned how to plow and hoe, and also learned about production knowledge such as what crops to plant in which season and how many seeds to sow.
    In Lujiang County, Wuhu Special District, there was no habit of ditching and managing ditches in summer crop fields in the past. Water accumulated in the fields could not be drained, which affected crop growth. Zhan Xianyu, the county party secretary, made a small ditch every four or five rows of seedlings in the experimental field for ditching experiments. This could not only drain the accumulated water, but also cultivate the soil to keep it warm, so that the rapeseed, which was not growing well, grew tender and green. In less than half a month, the county universally promoted the ditching method. From then on, when the masses saw the cadres topdressing and hoeing wheat in the experimental fields, they also topdressed and hoeed wheat. The masses often asked the cadres what they were going to do in the experimental fields. Now, the cadres here have formed a style of studying technology and are vying to buy agricultural technology books to learn knowledge. The Xinhua Bookstore sold out of agricultural technology books in December last year.
    (Our report) After receiving the CCP Central Committee's notice on promoting the planting of experimental fields, the Kunming Municipal Party Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss it. On the 15th, it issued instructions to the suburban district committees and relevant departments, requiring rural work cadres at the municipal, district, and township levels and departments and units directly related to agricultural production to plant experimental fields. It was also emphasized that leading cadres must do it themselves. After last year's autumn planting, some cadres in the city successively opened up some experimental fields, but most agencies and township and commune leading cadres did not actively participate. The Municipal Party Committee stipulated that experimental fields must be regarded as a major business to be engaged in.
    Regarding the scope of the experiment, the Municipal Party Committee also made the following regulations: (1) Conduct various comparative experiments under the same soil quality and cultivation conditions, such as dense planting, sparse planting, early sowing, late sowing, intercropping, mixed cropping, improved varieties, and native varieties. (2) Conduct experiments on reasonably changing local farming methods and farming systems. (3) Conduct various experiments aimed at solving the main obstacles to increasing production locally, such as soil improvement and depression transformation. (4) Select different soil qualities and conduct experiments on foreign yield-increasing experiences and foreign improved varieties. Special experiments should also be conducted on pig raising and the development of fruit trees. At the same time, it is stipulated that the main cadres of the city and districts should report to the Municipal Party Committee for record what kind of experimental fields they are planting, so that they can be inspected.

### 蚌埠芜湖两专区干部试验田种得好  干部作风和耕作习惯有新变化  昆明市委号召农村工作干部搞好试验田

    蚌埠芜湖两专区干部试验田种得好
    干部作风和耕作习惯有新变化
    昆明市委号召农村工作干部搞好试验田
    本报讯　安徽省蚌埠、芜湖两专区各级领导干部普遍重视种试验田的工作。蚌埠专区县、区、乡社领导干部在去年秋种时种的试验田有一万三千多亩。这些试验田打破了当地对秋种作物不施冬肥、不冬灌的旧习，普遍进行了追肥、冬灌和锄草，麦苗生长茁壮。怀远县沙沟乡因此也改变过去不追冬肥的习惯，在麦田里追了肥。该乡干部孙东富，是学生出身，不懂生产。通过种试验田后学会了犁地、锄地，也知道什么庄稼在什么季节种，下多少种子等生产知识。
    芜湖专区庐江县，过去在夏季作物田里没有抽沟理沟的习惯，田里积水不能排除，影响作物生长。县委书记湛先余在试验田里每隔四、五行苗做一条小沟，进行抽沟试验，这样既能排除积水，又能培土保温，使本来生长得不好的油菜长得又嫩又青。不到半个月全县普遍推行了抽沟办法。从此以后群众一看见干部在试验田里追肥、锄麦，群众也追肥锄麦。群众还经常向干部打听试验田里要作什么。现在，这里的干部已经形成了钻研技术的风气，争着买农业技术书籍学习知识，新华书店关于农业技术的书籍在去年12月就销售一空。
    本报讯　中共昆明市委接到中共中央关于推行种试验田的通知后，当即召开市委会议进行了讨论，15日向郊区区委及有关部门发出指示，要求市、区、乡的农村工作干部和与农业生产有直接关系的部门、单位，都种试验田。还强调种试验田一定要领导干部亲自动手。去年秋种以后，这个市部分干部陆续开辟了一些试验田，但大部机关和乡、社领导干部没有积极动手。市委规定，必须把试验田作为一项主要业务来搞。
    关于试验的范围，市委还作了如下规定：（一）在同等土质和耕作条件下，作各种不同的对比试验。如密植、稀植，早播、迟播，单作、混作，良种、土种等。（二）作合理改变当地耕作方法和耕作制度的试验。（三）针对解决当地增产主要障碍的各种试验。如土壤改良，洼地改造等。（四）选择不同土质，进行外地增产经验及外地优良品种的试验。对养猪、发展果木方面，也要有人专门进行试验。同时规定市、区主要干部种什么试验田，要向市委报告备案，以便检查。
