I completely agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and will resolutely implement them.

With the great victories of our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction, the Central Committee has proposed that within ten to fifteen years, we should not only build our country into a nation with modern industry and modern agriculture, but also transform it into a nation with modern science and culture. This is an extremely inspiring and great call. Furthermore, with the great victories of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province, both in urban and rural areas, are vigorously organizing a great leap forward in production, which will bring a new and tremendous development to our province's cultural and educational undertakings. With a feeling of pride, joy, and excitement, I would like to express some superficial opinions on the issue of people-run schools in Guizhou.

Nearly 500,000 Students in People-Run Primary Schools, Accounting for 30.5% of the Total Number of Primary School Students

Although Guizhou was a relatively backward mountainous area in terms of economy and culture in the past, primary school education has developed rapidly since liberation. Currently, there are more than 1,634,000 students in primary schools throughout the province, accounting for about one-tenth of the province's population. According to rough estimates (not excluding over-age children), the number of students in school accounts for more than 60% of all school-age children in our province. Among the 1.6 million students, there are 498,000 students in people-run primary schools, accounting for 30.5% of the total number of primary school students. The significant development of people-run primary schools in recent years fully proves that the Central Committee's policy of actively promoting people-run schools is correct; it shows that mass participation in running schools is not only necessary but also possible.

How were the more than 6,000 people-run primary schools in our province established? It is not difficult to imagine that many difficulties were encountered in the process. However, the broad masses of working people, though poor, have high aspirations. They were not daunted by various difficulties. Instead, the difficulties aroused their great enthusiasm and creativity, which they turned to overcoming the challenges. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, they exhausted all possible means to start schools and gradually consolidate them. Because they had suffered the pain of being "illiterate" in history, they not only urgently demanded to learn culture after liberation but also deeply valued and cared about their children's education. Some said, "If we don't have culture, we certainly won't be able to do a good job in socialism." But "if everything is paid for by state funds, the state funds will not be enough. The Party led us to overthrow the landlord class, can't we start a school for our children?" Their enthusiasm for running schools is like a long river, surging forward. No difficulty can stop them.

Making Do With What is Available, Self-Reliance, Building Schools With Our Own Hands

People-run schools implement the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily. They are very hard-working. The school buildings and equipment are all made do with what is available, and self-reliance is adopted to solve the problems. Temples, ancestral halls, and all available public houses are used, or private houses are borrowed. For repairs and construction, everyone contributes labor and materials. There are many examples of this. Zhanming Primary School in Sansui County was established as early as 1951. The school buildings and equipment were solved by the masses voluntarily contributing labor, materials, and money. The parents of the students used discarded wood to make desks and blackboards; everyone used donated wood and bark and their own labor to build school buildings, spending more than seventy workdays and twelve yuan to build a school building that could accommodate forty-nine students. If built according to the construction and equipment standards of public primary schools, it would require more than 2,000 yuan. If all the more than 6,000 people-run primary schools in the province were built according to this standard, it would require the state to invest more than 20 million yuan. The teachers and students of Sanpeng People-Run Primary School in Dushan County worked together, made their own bricks, cut their own grass, and used discarded wood. They spent only eight cents to buy nails and built a dormitory that could accommodate thirty people. The schools built by the masses with their own hands are especially cherished and supported by them. When there are difficulties, everyone contributes and they are all solved. Some people said: "As long as our children can go to school and not be 'illiterate' like ourselves when they grow up, we have been liberated. Although we can't afford much money now, our strength is not small. Little by little, everyone can contribute and start a school." Many schools' teachers and students make their own teaching aids and sports equipment. Some also use the students' extracurricular income to subscribe to newspapers and magazines. During an autumn harvest, the students of Huangniquing Primary School in Shibing County combined the love-grain movement, picked up more than 300 kilograms of grain, and sold it for nearly ten yuan, subscribing to "China Youth Daily," "New Children's Newspaper," and "Little Friend," and bought more than 30 comic books, enriching the teaching life. It can be seen that the potential power of relying on the collective strength of the masses to run schools is very great. Why do some people not value the strength of the masses and ignore the strength of the masses? The courses offered by people-run primary schools are mainly Chinese and arithmetic. Teaching is combined with the needs of rural production, such as arithmetic combined with how to record work points, etc. Teaching time: during the busy farming season, a half-day system is adopted, and it is not uniformly stipulated whether to go to school in the morning or in the afternoon. It doesn't matter whether it's early or late; come early to teach early and let go early, come late to teach late and let go late. During the busy season, school is closed. Extracurricular activities: carry out activities such as planting trees, planting vegetables, planting sunflowers, and tidying up the campus and leveling the playground. After school, students also help their families or cooperatives with work. Many cooperatives also have plans to arrange light work such as herding cattle for children.

Flexible Forms, Varying Scales, Self-Raising Funds, Various Methods

This spirit of diligence and thrift and flexibility can also be seen from the scale and form of the schools. The scale varies: small schools have one class with a dozen students; large schools have six classes with more than 200 students. Generally, the scale is smaller, with two or three classes being more common. There are currently several main forms of running schools: 1. People-run. The expenses are entirely raised by the masses. 2. Cooperative-run. The method of collecting tuition fees and cooperative subsidies is adopted, which is uniformly managed by the cooperative management committee and included in the cooperative's total budget. School buildings, equipment, and repairs are also planned and managed by the cooperative management committee, mobilizing cooperative members to contribute labor and materials. 3. People-run with public assistance. Tuition fees are collected, and a portion is subsidized from local additional funds, and a portion is subsidized by the public.

There are also various ways for the masses to raise funds themselves. 1. Whoever goes to school pays for it. The method is to determine the charging standard according to the grade level, with higher grades charging four yuan per student per semester, and lower grades charging one or two yuan. Some charge according to the student's family situation, such as a maximum of four yuan, a general three yuan, and a minimum of one yuan. Another way is to charge an average fee based on the number of students, generally three yuan per student per semester. 2. Raise funds in a self-reliant way based on needs and the principle of voluntariness in a fair and reasonable manner. 3. Give full play to the potential of mass labor and carry out blitz production labor for the school to raise funds. For example, in the past, people-run primary schools in Dushan city raised funds for school expenses by mobilizing the masses to engage in short-distance antimony ore transportation (each transportation could raise 100 yuan). In this way, adopting various forms makes it easier to give full play to and concentrate the strength of the masses, increase schools, expand classes, and enroll more children. At the same time, this spirit and method of diligence and thrift in running schools is not only necessary to rely on the strength of the masses to solve the financial difficulties of schools, but also necessary to correctly implement the country's education policy and cultivate laborers. It enables children to establish the view that labor is glorious, cultivate their habit of hard work and simplicity, and be cultivated from an early age to become modern new-style farmers who can use both their brains and hands.

Setting up Part-Farming and Part-Study Spare-Time Middle Schools, Cultivating Knowledgeable Youths Who are Capable in Both Literary and Military Skills

People-run middle schools have begun to develop in our province, but there are not many. Currently, there are about 3,000 students. Last year, Renhuai County in our province relied on the strength of the masses to set up a part-farming and part-study spare-time middle school. The situation of this school is as follows:

In Sangmu District, Renhuai County, there is a mountainous area called "Qiwangjia," which is 1,700 meters above sea level, with high mountains and heavy fog, cold climate, and a very remote location. Last summer, the Renhuai County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Renhuai County People's Committee, based on the requirements of the masses, in order to develop mountain production and cultivate hard-working and studious laboring intellectuals, used the old site of the farm on "Qiwangjia" Mountain to set up a farm spare-time junior middle school.

This farm spare-time junior middle school was mainly established by relying on the strength of the masses, so it was named the Qunli Farm Spare-Time Junior Middle School. When the news that the county decided to establish this school spread, it immediately received the enthusiastic support and active support of the masses in the local and neighboring districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives. Some agricultural cooperatives sent cattle, some sent piglets, and some sent farm tools (22 agricultural cooperatives nearby sent more than a dozen cattle and 54 piglets); the district's joint clinic sent a batch of medical supplies; county, district, and township cadres sent books and production tools, respectively, and donated more than 800 yuan. The government allocated a subsidy of 4,000 yuan. This not only helped solve the various difficulties at the beginning of the school's establishment, but also gave the school staff great encouragement. This school stood majestically on the "Qiwangjia" Mountain.

The masses welcomed this part-farming and part-study school very much, and cadres and the masses actively sent their children to apply for the school. Yang Maolin, the secretary of the 4th District Committee of Xishui, whose younger sister had been admitted to Tongzi Middle School, personally sent his younger sister to apply for the school after hearing that Renhuai was going to establish this part-farming and part-study school. When student Chen Zhaode's elder brother sent Chen Zhaode to apply for the school, he said: "None of my family has ever studied for generations. Now a family of more than a dozen people are illiterate. I am a Communist Party member and the production team leader in the cooperative. I am determined to take the socialist road. Because I am illiterate, my work is very difficult. I sent my younger brother to this school to cultivate him into a person who has both culture and can work." Student parent Wei Zhiqin said: "Like this kind of school, you can learn culture and grow crops. After three years, you will be capable in both literary and military skills, and you will no longer be half-baked." The school currently has 226 students, including 200 children of workers and peasants, and there are two Communist Party members and 54 Communist Youth League members.

Equal Emphasis on Work and Study, Half-Day Study and Half-Day Production, Work-Study Program, All Difficulties are Solved

The main feature of this school is that it emphasizes both work and study. The school's arrangement for studying and farming is: half-day study, half-day production; more study on rainy days, less study on sunny days. Generally, there are five lessons on three days of the week, and two lessons on three days of the week. The rest of the time is for labor, self-study, and rest. The students fetch water themselves, chop firewood themselves, carry grain themselves, and cultivate wasteland, farm, and raise livestock themselves. The school's production activities are carried out by class. The school has a production management committee. There are four classes in the school, and each class is divided into four production teams. Each class has a fixed farming area and farming task. In addition, a sideline production group is organized, and production tasks are fixed. Students are given work points for the work they do, and pay is given according to work. After several months of hard work, remarkable achievements have been made in production. The school has now sown more than 50 mu of wheat, 30 mu of buckwheat, and 20 mu of vegetables, and has harvested more than 10,000 catties. It has raised more than 100 pigs, accumulated more than 600,000 catties of fertilizer, and afforested more than 1,000 mu. In addition, it has made a batch of wooden and bamboo goods. In the past six months, it has repaired three classrooms, eight dormitories, and 28 pig pens, and transported thousands of catties of salt for the agricultural cooperative. Now, they are continuing to plow wasteland and are preparing to plant Chinese medicinal herbs such as white peony, angelica, and chuanxiong.

The school's study is also intensive. The courses currently offered in the first grade include politics, literature, Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, botany, etc., which are basically the same as ordinary middle schools. Teachers not only participate in production with the students, but also conduct teaching closely in conjunction with production. In the botany class, they combine fertilizer accumulation to teach students the principles of high-temperature composting. In the politics class, they also organize students to debate on important issues (such as whether labor is glorious). The quality of the students is relatively good. They have mastered a certain amount of production scientific knowledge. Now 37 people have learned to plow, 142 people have mastered the high-temperature and fast-acting composting method, and more than 80 people can do carpentry or masonry work. Judging from an arithmetic test held in the fourth class, among the 52 students, 10 got a score of 5, 36 got a score of 4, 4 got a score of 3, and only 2 got a score of 2.

This school was newly established not long ago, and it has many difficulties, but the teachers and students have the courage to overcome all difficulties. I think as long as we resolutely implement the principle of running schools diligently and thriftily and implement the method of work-study, all difficulties can be solved, and the school can be run well.

In the past, our understanding of the Central Committee's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily was not deep enough, and our understanding of the great significance of people-run schools was not profound, and we emphasized standardization. This affected the enthusiasm of the masses to run schools, and at one time created the phenomenon that the masses relied on the government to run schools or waited for the government to take over the schools after they were established. At the same time, emphasizing standardization resulted in neglecting labor education and failing to integrate school education with actual production labor. After agricultural cooperativization, on the basis of great development of production, the people's living standards have gradually improved greatly, and the masses' financial resources have become more abundant. We must resolutely implement the Central Committee's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and vigorously continue to develop mass participation in running schools. As Vice Premier Bo Yibo pointed out, the curriculum arrangement and education progress of schools run by the masses can be determined according to the opinions of the masses and the specific conditions of the local area, the forms can be diverse, and the learning time can be of different lengths. And the system of part-work and part-study should be implemented step by step. Then, our school education undertakings, under the correct leadership of the central and local Party committees and governments at all levels, will surely achieve new, greater and better development.

　　群众出钱出力办学校  培养勤耕苦读新农民
    田君亮代表介绍贵州省群众办学勤俭办学的情况
    我完全同意薄一波副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任所作的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    随着我们国家社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，中央提出了要在十年至十五年内不仅要把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业的国家，而且还要将我国建成为一个具有现代科学文化的国家。这是一个极端振奋人心的伟大号召。加以现在贵州省各族人民随着整风运动和反右派斗争的伟大胜利，无论城市、农村，都在轰轰烈烈的组织生产大跃进，这将为我省的文化教育事业带来一个新的巨大的发展。我以豪迈愉快兴奋的心情，就贵州的民办学校问题，发表一点粗浅的意见。
    民办小学学生近五十万  占小学生总数的30.5％
    贵州过去虽是一个经济文化较落后的山区，但在解放后小学教育就很快的有了大大的发展。现在，全省小学在校学生有一百六十三万四千余人，约占全省人口的十分之一。据不够精确的计算（没有除去超龄儿童），在校学生约占我省全部学龄儿童的百分之六十以上。在一百六十余万学生中，全省民办小学学生有四十九万八千余人，占小学生总数的百分之三十点五。几年来民办小学能有这样大的发展，完全证明了中央积极提倡民办的方针是正确的；说明了群众办学不但是必要的，也是可能的。
    我省的六千多所民办小学是怎样办起来的呢？不难想像，这中间是经历了许多的困难的。但是广大的劳动人民，人虽穷而志气特高，他们并没有被各种困难所吓倒，反因困难之来而激起极大的积极性创造性，转用以克服困难。在党和政府的领导下，想尽了一切所能想到的办法，把学校竟办了起来，并且逐步的得到巩固。他们因为在历史上受尽了“睁眼瞎”的痛苦，因此解放后不惟自己迫切要求学习文化，而且深切地重视和关心自己的子女的学习。有的说：“我们如果没有文化，就一定办不好社会主义的事情。”但是“如果事事都由国家的经费来开支，国家经费是来不及的。党领导我们能够打倒地主阶级，我们就不能够为自己的子女办个学校吗？”他们办学的积极性有如长河流注，奋迅直前。任何困难决不能阻止他们。
    因陋就简　自力更生  自己动手　创建学校
    民办学校贯彻了勤俭办学的方针，他们是很艰苦的。学校的校舍、设备，都是因陋就简，采取自力更生的办法来解决。利用了庙宇、祠堂和一切可以利用的公房，或者借用民房。必须修缮、修建的，就大家献工、献材料来解决。这方面的事例很多。三穗县有个展明小学，远在一九五一年就开办了，校舍、设备就是由群众自动出人工、献材料、捐钱解决的。学生家长利用废旧木料做课桌、黑板；大家用捐献的木料、树皮，自己出人工来盖校舍，花了七十多个工，十二元钱，便把一所可容纳四十九个学生的校舍居然修好了。如果按照公办小学的基建、设备标准来修建，需要二千余元，如果全省六千多所民办小学，都按这个标准来修建，那就需要国家投资二千余万元。独山县三捧民办小学，师生动手，用了一个月的时间，自己打砖，自己割草，利用废旧木料，只花八角钱买钉子，就盖好一间可容三十个人住的宿舍。群众用自己的双手办起来的学校，他们特别爱护、支持，有了困难，每人出一把力，就都解决了。有的群众说：“只要娃儿读上书不再像自己一样长大来是个‘睁眼瞎’，我们翻了身，现在能出的钱虽还不多，但力量可不小，星星点点，大家一凑也能办个学校”。许多学校师生动手自制教具和体育用具。有的还用学生课外的收入来订书报杂志。施秉县黄泥罄小学在一次秋收时，学生们结合爱粮运动捡粮三百余斤，卖得人民币将近十元，订了“中国青年报”、“新少年报”、“小朋友”等报刊，还买了三十多册连环画等，丰富了教学生活。可以看出，依靠群众的集体力量办学，潜在力量是很大的。为什么有些人不重视群众的力量，忽视群众的力量呢？民办小学开设的课程：主要是语文和算术。教学则结合农村生产的需要，如算术结合如何记工分等。教学时间：农忙时采取半日制，不一律规定上午或者是下午上学。也不论早晚，早来早教早放学，晚来晚教晚放学。大忙时就放假。课外活动：开展植树、栽菜、种向日葵和整校园、平操场等活动。学生放学回家还帮助家里或社里做活路。许多合作社还有计划的为儿童安排了放牛等轻便活路。
    形式灵活　规模有大有小  自筹经费　办法多种多样
    这种勤俭办学的精神和灵活性，还可以从学校的规模和形式上看出来。规模有大有小：小的一班，十几个学生；大的有六班，学生二百余人。一般是规模较小，设二、三个班的较多。办学形式，现在主要有这几种：一、民办。经费完全由群众自筹。二、社办。采取收学费和社补助的办法，统一由社管会管理，并列入社的总预算。校舍设备、修建也由社管会统一筹划管理，动员社员献工献料。三、民办公助。收学费，从地方附加经费中补助一部分，公助一部分。
    群众自筹经费的办法也是多种多样的。一、谁上学谁出钱。办法是依年级高低确定收费标准，高年级每生每学期四元，低年级一、二元。有的根据学生家庭情况来收费，如最高四元，一般三元，最低一元。再就是根据学生人数平均收费，一般为每生每学期三元。二、根据需要和自愿原则，以平均合理负担的方式自筹。三、发挥群众劳动的潜力，为学校进行突击性的生产劳动来筹集经费。如过去独山城区民办小学便是通过发动群众从事短距离的搬运锑矿（每搬一次可筹集一百元）作为学校经费。这样，采取多种多样的形式，就更便于发挥和集中群众的力量，增设学校，扩大班级，吸收更多的儿童入学。同时，这种勤俭办学的精神和办法，既为依靠群众力量，解决学校经费困难所必需，也是正确贯彻国家的教育方针，培养劳动者的任务所必要。使儿童树立起劳动光荣的观点，养成他（她）们艰苦朴素的习惯，从小就被培养成为一个能脑手并用的现代新式农民。
    办起边耕边读的业余中学  培养能文能武的知识青年
    民办中学在我省已开始发展，但还不多，现约有学生三千人。去年我省仁怀县依靠群众力量，办了一所边耕边读的业余中学。这所学校的情况是这样：
    仁怀县桑木区有个叫做“七碗架”的山地，拔海一千七百公尺，山高雾大，气候寒冷，位置也很偏僻。去年夏季，中共仁怀县委和仁怀县人民委员会根据群众的要求，为了发展山区生产，培养勤耕苦读的劳动知识青年，就利用“七碗架”山的农场旧址，办了一所农场业余初级中学。
    这间农场业余初级中学，主要也是依靠群众的力量办起来的，因此取名叫做群力农场业余初级中学。当县里决定创办这间学校的消息传出后，立即得到了当地和邻近的区乡、农业社群众的热烈拥护和积极支持。农业社有的送耕牛，有的送猪仔，有的送农具（附近二十二个农业社送给耕牛十几头，猪仔五十四只）；区的联合诊所送了一批医药用品；县、区、乡干部分别送了书籍和生产用具，并捐献人民币八百余元，政府拨给补助费四千元。这不仅帮助解决了办校之初的种种困难，而且给办校人员极大的鼓舞。这所学校就在“七碗架”的山上巍然出现了。
    群众对这间半耕半读的学校十分欢迎，干部和群众都积极的送自己的子弟来报考。鳛水四区区委书记杨茂林同志的妹妹，本来考取了桐梓中学，听说仁怀要办这间半耕半读的学校后，亲自把他妹妹送来报考。学生陈昭德的哥哥送陈昭德来报考时说：“我家几辈人都没有读过书，现在一家十几口人都不识字，我是一个共产党员，在合作社里担任生产队长，是坚决走社会主义道路的人，就因为不识字，工作很吃力，我送我弟弟来上这间学校，就是要把他培养成为又有文化又能劳动的人。”学生家长魏志勤又说：“像这样的学校，能学到文化，又会种庄稼，三年出来后能文能武，再不是半边的了”。该校现有学生二百二十六人，其中工农子弟二百人，并有两个共产党员，五十四个共青团员。
　　工读并重　半天读书半天生产  勤工俭学　一切困难迎刃而解
    这间学校办学的主要特点，就是工、读并重。学校对读书和耕作的安排是：半天读书，半天生产；雨天多读，晴天少读。一般一个星期有三天上五节课，有三天上两节课，其余的时间便是劳动、自学和休息。学生们自己挑水，自己砍柴，自己搬运粮食，自己开荒、种地、喂养牲畜。学校的生产活动，是按班级来进行的。学校设有生产管理委员会，全校四个班，每个班分设四个生产小队。每个班都有固定的耕作地区和耕作任务。此外还组织副业生产小组，并固定了生产任务。学生们作了活路，都要评记工分，实行按劳取酬。经过几个月的努力，在生产上取得了显著的成绩。全校现已播种了五十多亩麦子，三十亩荞麦，二十亩蔬菜并已收割一万多斤。喂猪一百余头，积肥六十多万斤。造林一千多亩。此外，还做了一批木货和篾货。半年来修了三间教室，八间宿舍，二十八个猪圈，并替农业社运了数千斤食盐。现在，他们正在继续翻犁荒土，还准备种白芍、当归、川芎等中药材。
    学校的学习也是紧张的。现有的一年级所设课程有政治、文学、汉语、算术、历史、地理、植物等，基本上和普通中学的一样。教师们不仅和学生们一道参加生产，并密切结合生产进行教学。在上植物课时，就结合积肥，教学生们学会高温堆肥的原理。在上政治课时，对重要问题（如劳动是不是光荣）还组织学生们进行辩论。学生们的质量都比较好，掌握了一定的生产科学知识，现在有三十七人学会犁土，一百四十二人掌握了高温速效堆肥方法，八十多人能做木工或泥水工。学习上从第四班举行的一次算术测验来看，五十二个学生中，得五分的有十人，得四分的三十六人，得三分的四人，得二分的只有二人。
    这间学校新成立不久，它的困难还很多，但是，教师和学生们都有勇气来克服一切困难。我想只要坚决贯彻勤俭办学校的方针，实行勤工俭学的方法，一切困难也是能够迎刃而解的，学校也是无有办不好的。
    过去我们对中央勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针认识不够，体会不深，对民办学校的重大意义认识不深刻，强调正规化。这就影响了群众办学的积极性，并一度产生了群众依赖政府办学或者办起来等待政府接办的现象。同时，强调正规化的结果，忽视了劳动教育，不能把学校教育与实际生产劳动很好地结合起来。农业合作化以后，在生产大发展的基础上，人民群众的生活逐步获得很大的改善，群众的财力更为雄厚。我们要坚决贯彻执行中央勤俭建国的方针，大力地继续发展群众办学。正如薄一波副总理所指出的，群众举办的学校，课程安排和教育进度可以根据群众的意见和当地的具体情况来决定，形式可以多种多样，学习时间可以长短不同。并且有步骤地实行半工半读的制度。那末，我们的学校教育事业，在中央和地方各级党政的正确领导下，决能获得新的更大更好的发展。
