Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th - TASS: The United Nations Security Council met on February 18, under the chairmanship of Soviet representative Sobolev, to discuss Tunisia's proposal accusing France of aggression in the village of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef on February 8, 1958. The Security Council's agenda also included France's accusation against Tunisia regarding the Algerian situation.

For several days, the United States and Britain have exhausted all means in Washington, Paris, London, and at the United Nations headquarters in New York to prevent the Security Council from substantively discussing Tunisia's accusation. To this end, the United States and Britain suggested mediating between Tunisia and France. Both Tunisia and France accepted this mediation proposal. Therefore, yesterday's Security Council meeting adopted the agenda and heard statements from some representatives, who all believed it was necessary to use the opportunity for mediation to resolve the conflict between Tunisia and France.

Sobolev spoke in his capacity as the Soviet representative. He referred to the US and British proposal to mediate the French-Tunisian conflict, saying that the issue of mediation was in accordance with the UN Charter. He said that the Soviet delegation felt it necessary to declare that the Soviet government's view on the issue of mediation is that a country can mediate any international conflict or dispute, but should not use such mediation to pressure any country to accept conditions that undermine its sovereignty, or take the opportunity to profit for the country offering mediation.

The Tunisian representative, who was invited to attend the Security Council meeting, said that in resolving the conflict, Tunisia, both within and outside the United Nations, will adhere to the terms put forward in the letter requesting the Security Council to convene this meeting. It is known that the Tunisian government, in these documents, considers the bombing of Tunisian villages by French aircraft as an act of aggression, and emphasizes that this is not the first time such an act has occurred. In order to maintain international peace and security in the region, Tunisia insists that all French troops be completely withdrawn from Tunisian territory and that France stop the war in Algeria.

The Tunisian representative said that the mediation by the United States and Britain has not yet begun, and it is unknown what the outcome will be. Therefore, he reserves the right to request the Security Council to convene an emergency meeting at any time to resume discussion of Tunisia's accusation against France.

The Security Council meeting adjourned on the motion of representatives from Sweden and Japan. Tunisia's accusation of French aggression against Tunisia remains on the Security Council's agenda.

    安理会讨论突尼斯控诉法国侵略案
    索波列夫正告美英不可借调解谋利
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社纽约19日讯：联合国安全理事会2月18日在苏联代表索波列夫主持下开会，讨论了突尼斯控诉法国1958年2月8日在萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村侵略突尼斯的提案。在安全理事会的议程上还列入了法国就阿尔及利亚事件对突尼斯的控诉案。
    几天以来，美国和英国在华盛顿、巴黎、伦敦和纽约联合国总部用尽一切办法，不让安全理事会切实地讨论突尼斯的控诉案。为此，美国和英国建议替突尼斯和法国调解。突尼斯和法国都接受了这一调解建议。因此，安理会昨天的会议通过了议程，并且听取了某些代表的发言，他们都认为有必要利用调解的机会来解决突尼斯和法国的冲突。
    索波列夫以苏联代表的身份发言。他提到美国和英国调解法、突冲突的建议，并且说调解问题是符合联合国宪章的。他说，苏联代表团认为有必要声明，苏联政府在调停问题上的看法是，一个国家可以调解任何一个国际冲突或争端，但是不应该利用这种调停来压迫任何一个国家接受损害其主权的条件，或者趁此机会为出面调解的国家谋利。
    应邀参加安理会会议的突尼斯代表说，在解决冲突的问题上，突尼斯在联合国内外都将坚持在要求安理会召开这次会议的信中所提出的那些条款。大家知道，突尼斯政府在这些文件中认为法国飞机轰炸突尼斯村庄是侵略行为，同时强调指出，这种行为已经不是第一次了。为了维护这个地区的国际和平和安全，突尼斯坚持要所有法国军队全部从突尼斯领土撤出并且要法国停止在阿尔及利亚的战争。
    突尼斯代表说，美国和英国的调停还没有开始，不知道将会有什么样的结果。因此他保留要求安理会随时召开紧急会议来恢复讨论突尼斯对法国的控诉案的权利。
    安理会会议根据瑞典和日本两国代表的动议宣布休会。突尼斯控诉法国侵略突尼斯的控诉案仍然保留在安理会的议程上。
