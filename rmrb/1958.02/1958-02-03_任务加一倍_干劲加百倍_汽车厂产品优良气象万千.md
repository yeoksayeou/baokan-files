Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 2nd. The employees of the First Automobile Works, who overproduced more than 500 cars for the country last year, have again excellently completed this year's January automobile production plan.

　　This year, although the factory's car output has increased by more than double compared to last year, the workers' enthusiasm has increased even more. The casting workshop's January casting output increased by 20% compared to December, the month with the highest output last year, while the scrap rate was the lowest since production began. The quality of almost all of the more than 130 types of castings met the technical requirements. The engine workshop, which has the most demanding production tasks, has achieved a new record of over 90% of workers producing no defective products, due to workers strictly following the process during operation and maintaining close contact with technical inspection personnel.

　　The production scheduling records of the general assembly workshop show that because all workshops can supply high-quality auto parts according to plan and in a balanced manner, the operation of the general assembly line is more normal than in any previous month.

　　任务加一倍　干劲加百倍
    汽车厂产品优良气象万千
    本报特约新华社长春2日电  去年为国家超产五百多辆汽车的第一汽车制造厂职工又出色地完成了今年1月份的汽车生产计划。
    今年，这个工厂的汽车产量虽然比去年增大了一倍多，但是工人们的干劲却增加得更多。铸工车间1月份铸件产量比去年产量最高的12月提高了20％，而废品却是开工生产以来最少的一个月，一百三十多种铸件的质量，几乎全部达到了技术要求。生产任务最繁重的发动机车间，由于工人在操作过程中严格执行工艺，并且同技术检查人员密切联系，已经出现了90％以上工人无废品的新纪录。
    总装配车间的生产调度记录表明：由于各车间都能按计划均衡地供应质量优良的汽车零件，总装配线的运转比以往任何一个月都更为正常。
