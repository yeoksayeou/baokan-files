　　Not Terrible, But Excellent
　　-- On Promoting the Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow
　　There can be two different attitudes towards any new thing – a revolutionary attitude and a conservative attitude. In the work of promoting the double-wheel double-share plow in our province, these two attitudes are particularly evident.
　　Some people say the double-wheel double-share plow is terrible and not suitable for rice cultivation at all. This can be represented by some comrades in Yin County. In 1957, they returned a large number of double-wheel double-share plows to the supply and marketing cooperatives. Some people say the double-wheel double-share plow is excellent, enthusiastically welcome it, and try every means to overcome difficulties so that it can be promoted. This can be represented by the comrades in Huangyan County.
　　In order to promote the double-wheel double-share plow, Huangyan County has taken many measures and done a lot of work. They recognize that promoting the double-wheel double-share plow is an important measure to promote a great leap forward in agricultural production. The county's Party Congress has made corresponding resolutions for this purpose. And leading cadres personally took the lead, set an example, gained experience, and promoted the general. They not only wrote this matter into their resolutions, but also seriously did a lot of work, organizing all cadres to implement it. Huangyan County has taken vigorous measures in six aspects in promoting the double-wheel double-share plow: First, it has repeatedly carried out demonstrations, held exhibitions, and organized visits to solve the conservative ideas of cadres and the masses; Second, it has strengthened technical guidance and trained farm implement operators in every team; Third, it has rationally organized labor, solved the problem of matching cattle, and implemented the system of five determinations and three guarantees (the five determinations are determining people, cattle, fields, quality, and distribution; the three guarantees are guaranteeing the plow, cattle, and teaching technology); Fourth, it has established semi-mechanized production teams in areas with suitable conditions to give greater play to the double-share plow; Fifth, it has renovated the land to meet the needs of the double-share plow, abolishing field ridges, merging fields, and widening roads; Sixth, it has solved the problem of insufficient cattle. In order to promote the double-wheel double-share plow, the relevant departments in Huangyan County have also done a lot of work. They have indeed mobilized the whole Party and everyone has taken action. Supply and marketing, grain, banks, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural departments have all done a lot of work. As a result of the above work done by Huangyan County, more than 50,000 mu of land plowed with double-wheel double-share plows have increased production compared with those plowed with wooden plows. The index of increased production generally reached 4.8%, and as high as 33% in the first cooperative of Jiaokeng Township in 1957 in comparison with wooden plows. The county farm's land plowed with double-wheel double-share plows produced 64 jin more per mu than those plowed with wooden plows. Not only the experiments in Huangyan County proved that the use of double-wheel double-share plows can increase production and save labor, but also in Jiashan County, and in many agricultural cooperatives and farms in the province, the superiority of the double-wheel double-share plow has been proven. The significant advantages of the double-wheel double-share plow are that it saves labor, improves labor efficiency, reduces labor intensity, plows deeper, and turns the soil evenly, making the land's fertilizer retention stronger, and making the rice roots deeper and the fertilizer absorption area larger. Therefore, it can greatly increase crop production. More than a year of practice has proven that the comrades in Huangyan County are true promoters, not demoters. The double-wheel double-share plow is not terrible, but excellent.
　　What work did the leaders of Yin County do to promote the double-wheel double-share plow? They only held a training class with only fifty people, but even this training class was only attended by more than twenty people. As a result, no serious training was carried out, and it had to be changed to a forum. People who attended the forum neither learned the technology nor solved ideological problems and then dispersed. During the spring plowing period, they did not carry out other organizational work. When the masses returned the plows in large numbers, they did not take the necessary measures.
　　Now, the superiority of the double-share plow has been clearly placed before us. All kinds of arguments criticizing the double-wheel double-share plow have been proven to be unfounded by facts. In order to learn from this matter and improve our understanding, it is not without significance to recall the various statements we came into contact with at that time.
　　"Farmers have always plowed the fields with one cow, how can two cows be harnessed to one plow? How can the cows cooperate?" Facts have proven that as long as they are matched and trained, the cows can cooperate with each other and adapt to the needs of double-wheel double-share plow cultivation. Many agricultural cooperatives in Huangyan County and other counties have achieved successful experience in training cattle to pull double-share plows.
　　"Using the double-wheel double-share plow puts too much burden on the cows." However, according to measurements, the cow does not work harder when pulling the double-wheel double-share plow than when pulling the wooden plow. On the contrary, the traction resistance of two wooden plows is 11% heavier than the double-wheel double-share plow. Moreover, the pulling force of the double-wheel double-share plow can be greatly reduced. Now the industrial and agricultural departments are studying how to solve this problem, and have already achieved results, and will further improve it in the future.
　　"The fields are small and the roads are narrow, and the double-wheel double-share plow cannot be used." Facts have proven that small fields can be changed into large fields, and narrow field ridges can also be widened. Changing small fields into large fields and changing narrow field ridges into wider roads is originally a requirement for the development of agricultural production, which can greatly improve labor efficiency. Changing small plots of land into large plots is also a new need brought about by the agricultural technology revolution after cooperativization, and it is entirely possible to solve this problem after cooperativization. However, some comrades are still firmly bound by the state of these small plots of land, and have not thought of being able to remove this bondage and break this bondage. Some people also use the fact that farm implement operators do not know how to use the double-wheel double-share plow, or that they are not skilled in using it at the beginning, to negate the role of the double-wheel double-share plow. They do not know that the technical proficiency of farm implement operators will also gradually improve. This technology can be mastered through training and practice. Cultivation efficiency can be improved accordingly with the improvement of the operator's operating skills. When Lianyuan Cooperative of Lianshu Township, Wenling County, began to try using the double-wheel double-share plow, it could not plow even three mu a day, but two days later it increased to eight or nine mu. Later, it plowed twelve mu, while the local wooden plow could only plow four mu. This is one example.
　　Subjective and objective conditions are changing, and they are bound to change.
　　History requires us to look forward, not backward. We must be masters of nature, not slaves of nature. The history of the development of human society is first of all the history of the development of production, the history of people creating and developing production tools. In order to develop production, our ancestors have experienced a very difficult path, which is many times greater than the difficulties encountered in the process of promoting double-wheel double-share plows. They have overcome all difficulties. Can the current difficulties in promoting the double-wheel double-share plow prevent us from moving forward?
　　Due to the increase in the multiple cropping index in our province, the vigorous development of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and the implementation of various other production increase measures, a contradiction has emerged in agricultural production between the promotion of production increase measures and the shortage of labor. After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the broad masses of peasants have a strong desire to develop productive forces. One of the manifestations of this desire is the demand to improve farm implements, learn technology, and learn advanced experience. Because only by continuously improving agricultural production tools and continuously improving agricultural technology can we solve the contradiction between the promotion of advanced production increase measures and the shortage of labor, can we continuously improve the level of agricultural production, and can we continuously improve the living standards of the broad masses of peasants, and realize the tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
　　The development of the productive forces of any society is manifested in the improvement of labor tools and the improvement of the production experience and labor skills of laborers. After cooperativization, in order to make the productive forces of our new society develop, especially to achieve leap-forward development, the most fundamental issue is to grasp the two elements of improving tools and improving technology, and to make them constantly change and progress. In order to promote the development of productive forces, our current historical task is to carry out a technological revolution while continuing to complete the revolution on the political front and the ideological front. Through this revolution, we will change our backward technological situation and greatly improve our productive forces.
　　In order to promote the revolution in agricultural technology, what we must pay special attention to now is how to summarize and promote the masses' improvements and creations in agricultural technology, and to popularize and improve the masses' creations. It is wrong to ignore the advanced tools, advanced technologies, and advanced experiences that appear among the masses. However, it is also wrong to reject and refuse new tools and new experiences from outside. We must both summarize the existing advanced experiences among the local masses, and promote the advanced technologies and experiences from other places that have been proven to be effective, and be good at using the technologies and experiences from other places according to local conditions, and develop them.
　　Promoting double-wheel double-share plows and other new-style farm implements, coupled with other technical measures, can help us carry out this technological revolution in agriculture. Promoting double-wheel double-share plows and various new-style farm implements is a great beginning for technically transforming agriculture and leading agriculture onto the track of modernization and mechanization. When we adopt or promote various new-style farm implements, we are taking a step forward in the agricultural technology revolution. Therefore, the attitude we take towards promoting the double-wheel double-share plow is essentially the question of whether we want to carry out the agricultural technology revolution, whether we want to develop productive forces, and whether we want eight hundred jin. The fundamental difference in the issue of promoting the double-wheel double-share plow lies here.
　　Right-leaning thinking in agricultural production is often manifested in the learning and promotion of new farming systems, new agricultural technologies, and new farm implements. Being brave in innovation will promote the improvement of agricultural productive forces; sticking to old ways will hinder the development of productive forces. Promoting or hindering the development of productive forces is the difference between revolutionaries and conservatives. We should be revolutionaries and not conservatives.
　　The emergence of any new tool will not be without shortcomings. The history of the development of the entire production tool shows that the development of production tools is also a process from imperfection to perfection. Many shortcomings need to be overcome in production practice. Many production tools also need to be transformed according to the characteristics of different regions to make them suitable for local conditions and meet the needs of different regions and different situations. There are indeed some unsuitable places for the double-wheel double-share plow, which was originally suitable for use in the north, to be promoted in the paddy fields of the south. However, it now appears that these unsuitable places can all be overcome by improving the double-share plow. Now we have achieved preliminary results in improving the double-share plow according to the characteristics of rice-growing areas, and we have initially overcome the shortcomings of the original double-wheel double-share plow that were unsuitable for cultivation in rice-growing areas. This is also the difference between revolutionaries and conservatives. Revolutionaries believe in and support the development of new things, help it overcome some shortcomings, and make it grow stronger; while conservatives shrink back when they encounter difficulties, and feel that nothing is easy to do. They take a skeptical attitude towards promoting double-wheel double-share plows in rice-growing areas and striving to achieve eight hundred jin and one thousand jin. The agricultural production upsurge that has risen and is rising higher and higher, and the high enthusiasm of the broad masses to strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, are demonstrating the boundless strength of the broad masses. Under the leadership of the Party, they will surely turn ideals into reality and sweep away the pessimistic arguments of conservatives.
　　To promote the double-wheel double-share plow, we must adopt the method of personal experimentation, typical demonstration, and visits and performances, and use facts to convince the masses; we must help the masses master the technology and create conditions for the smooth use of the double-wheel double-share plow; we must continue to conduct experiments under different conditions; and we must conduct correct selection and serious training for farm implement operators. It is also wrong to let things take their own course, or to simply blindly pursue the numbers of promotion without considering the specific conditions.
　　Historical experience tells us that whether we stand at the head of the masses to lead the masses is an important key to test the Party's leadership and test every Communist Party member. We should stand in front of the masses to lead the masses, not accommodate the backward emotions of the masses, firmly support advanced and new things, and promote the development of productive forces. This is the important lesson we should learn in the work of promoting the double-wheel double-share plow.

　　浙江日报社论
    不是糟得很而是好得很
　　——论推广双轮双铧犁
    对于任何新生的事物都可能有两种不同的态度——革命的态度和保守的态度。本省在推广双轮双铧犁的工作中，这两种态度表现得尤为明显。
    一种人说双轮双铧犁糟得很，根本不适宜于水稻耕作。这可以以鄞县的某些同志为代表。他们在1957年曾经把大批的双轮双铧犁退给供销合作社。一种人说双轮双铧犁好得很，热烈地欢迎它，千方百计克服困难，使它能够得到推广。这可以以黄岩县的同志为代表。
    为了推广双轮双铧犁，黄岩县采取了许多措施，做了许多工作。他们认识到推广双轮双铧犁是促进农业生产大跃进的一项重要措施，全县党的代表大会曾经为此作出了相应的决议。并且由领导干部亲自动手，做出样子，取得经验，推动一般。他们不仅把这件事情写在自己的决议里面，而且认真做了许多工作，组织全体干部贯彻执行。黄岩县在推广双轮双铧犁中，从六方面采取了有力的措施：首先是多次进行示范、开展览会，组织参观，解决干部和群众的保守思想；其次是加强技术指导，队队训练农具手；第三是合理组织劳力，解决耕牛搭配问题，实行五定三保制度（五定是定人、定牛、定田、定质、定分；三保是保犁、保牛、保教技术）；第四是在有条件的地区建立半机械化生产队，使双铧犁发挥更大的作用；第五是适应双铧犁的需要来整修土地，取消田塍、合并田块、加宽道路，第六是解决耕牛不足问题。为了推广双轮双铧犁，黄岩县有关的各个部门也做了许多工作，他们的确做到了全党动员，大家动手。供销、粮食、银行、手工业联社、农业部门都做了许多工作。黄岩县做了上述工作的结果是：五万多亩用双轮双铧犁耕的田地都比用木犁耕的增加了产量。增产的指数一般的达4.8％，高的如焦坑乡第一社1957年与木犁对照试验，高达33％。县农场用双轮双铧犁耕的田比木犁耕的每亩增产六十四斤。不仅黄岩县的试验证明了使用双轮双铧犁可以增产，节省劳动力，而且在嘉善县，在全省许多农业社和农场，都证明了双轮双铧犁的优越性。双轮双铧犁显著的优点是节省劳动力，提高劳动效率，减低劳动强度，耕得深，翻土匀，使土地蓄肥力强，使稻根扎得深，吸肥面大，因而，可以使农作物大大增产。一年多的实践证明：黄岩县的同志是真正的促进派，而不是促退派。双轮双铧犁不是糟得很，而是好得很。
    鄞县的领导上对于推广双轮双铧犁做了些什么工作呢？他们仅仅举办过一次只有五十人参加的训练班，可是，就是这次训练班，也只到了二十多人，结果就没有认真进行训练，只好改为座谈会，参加座谈会的人既没有学会技术，又没有解决思想问题就散了。在春耕期间，他们也没有进行其他的组织工作。当群众大批退犁的时候，他们也没有采取应有的措施。
    现在，双铧犁的优越性已经清楚地摆在我们面前。各种各样非难双轮双铧犁的论调，事实证明是没有根据的。为了从这件事情里面吸取教训，提高我们的认识，回忆一下当时我们所接触的各种各样的说法，不是没有意义的。
    “农民耕田历来就是一头牛，两头牛怎样能够套在一部犁上呢？牛怎样能够合作呢？”事实证明，只要经过搭配，经过训练以后，牛就可以彼此合作，适应双轮双铧犁耕作的需要。黄岩县和其他县的不少的农业社都已取得了训练耕牛拉双铧犁成功的经验。
    “使用双轮双铧犁，牛的负担太重了。”但据测量的结果，牛拉双轮双铧犁并不比拉木犁吃力，相反，二部木犁的牵引阻力还要比双轮双铧犁重11％。而且双轮双铧犁的拉力还是可以大大减低的。现在工农业部门已经在研究解决这个问题，并且已经有了结果，将来还会进一步改良。
    “田小路窄，双轮双铧犁是无法使用的。”事实证明了：小块田可以改成大块田，田埂窄狭也是可以加宽的。把小块田改成大块田，把窄狭的田埂改成比较宽大的道路，这本来是发展农业生产的要求，可以大大提高劳动效率。把小块田地改大，这也是合作化之后实行农业技术革命带来的新的需要，而在合作化以后，也完全可能解决这个问题。可是，有些同志还是牢牢地被这种小块田地的状况束缚住，没有想到能够解除这种束缚，打破这种束缚。还有人拿农具手不会使用双轮双铧犁，或者开始使用不熟练的情况来否定双轮双铧犁的作用。他们不知道农具手的技术熟练程度也是会逐渐提高的。只要经过训练、经过实践就可以掌握这种技术。耕作效率可以随着农具手的操作技术的熟练程度的提高而相应的提高。温岭县联树乡联源社开始试用双轮双铧犁时，一天耕不到三亩，两天以后就提高到八、九亩。以后就耕到十二亩，当地木犁只能耕到四亩。这就是一个例子。
    主观和客观的情况都在变化，而且是一定要变化的。
    历史要求我们向前看而不要向后看。我们要作自然的主人而不要作自然的奴隶。人类社会发展的历史首先是生产发展的历史，是人们创造和发展生产工具的历史。我们的祖先为着发展生产，曾经经历了十分艰难困苦的道路，比之在推广双轮双铧犁过程中出现的困难不知要大多少倍。一切困难他们都克服了。难道目前推广双轮双铧犁的这一些困难就能够阻止我们前进吗？
    本省由于复种指数的提高，大力开展兴修水利积肥运动，以及推行其他各种增产措施，在农业生产中已出现了推行增产措施和劳动力不足的矛盾。在实现了农业合作化之后，广大农民又存在着强烈的发展生产力的愿望。这种愿望表现之一是要求改良农具，学习技术、学习先进经验。因为只有不断改良农业生产工具和不断提高农业技术，才能解决推广先进增产措施和劳动力不足的矛盾，才能不断地提高农业生产的水平，也才能够不断提高广大农民的生活水平，提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的任务。
    任何社会的生产力的发展，都表现在劳动工具的改进、劳动者的生产经验和劳动技术的提高上面。在合作化之后，要使我们的新社会的生产力向前发展，特别是获得飞跃的发展，最根本的问题，就是要抓住改进工具和提高技术这两个要素，使之不断地变革和进步。为了促进生产力的发展，我们现在的历史任务就是要在继续完成政治战线上和思想战线上的革命的同时，进行一个技术革命，通过这个革命，改变我们技术落后的状况，大大提高我们的生产力。
    为了促进农业技术的革命，现在我们特别要注意的是如何总结和推广群众对于农业技术的改进和创造，把群众的创造加以普及、提高。忽视群众中出现的先进工具、先进技术、先进经验，是不对的。但是，排斥与拒绝外来的新的工具和新的经验，也是不对的。既要总结本地群众中现有的先进经验，又要推广外地的已经行之有效的先进技术和经验，善于根据本地的情况利用外地的技术和经验，并使之发展。
    推广双轮双铧犁和其他的新式农具加上其他的技术措施，便可以帮助我们在农业方面进行这种技术革命。推广双轮双铧犁和各种新式农具，便是对农业进行技术改造、把农业引上现代化机械化轨道的伟大的开端。我们采用或推广了各种各样的新式农具，便是在农业技术革命上前进了一步。所以，对于推广双轮双铧犁采取什么态度，实质上是我们要不要进行农业技术革命的问题，要不要发展生产力的问题，要不要八百斤的问题。在推广双轮双铧犁这个问题上存在的根本分歧就在这里。
    农业生产方面的右倾思想，往往表现在对待新的耕作制度、新的农业技术、新的农具的学习和推广上。勇于革新就会促进农业生产力的提高；因循守旧就会阻碍生产力的发展。促进或者阻碍生产力的发展，这就是革命派和保守派的区别所在，我们应该作革命派而不要作保守派。
    任何一种新的工具的产生不会没有缺点。整个生产工具发展的历史，说明生产工具的发展也是由不完善走向完善的，许多缺点要在生产实践中加以克服。许多生产工具也需要根据不同地区的特点加以改造，使之因地制宜，适应不同地区不同情况的需要。开始适宜于在北方使用的双轮双铧犁要在南方水田区推广，的确有一些不适宜的地方。可是，现在看来，这些不适宜的地方都是可以用改进双铧犁的办法来加以克服的。现在我们根据水稻地区的特点来改进双铧犁，已经取得了初步成绩，已经初步克服了原来双轮双铧犁存在的不适宜于在水稻地区耕作的缺点了。这也是革命派和保守派不同的地方。革命派相信和扶持新事物的发展，帮助它克服某些缺点，使它成长壮大；而保守派则是碰到困难就低头退缩，觉得什么事情都不容易办到，他们对水稻地区推广双轮双铧犁、对争取实现八百斤、一千斤，都采取怀疑态度。现在已经兴起并且日益高涨的农业生产高潮，广大的群众争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要的高度热情，正表现着广大群众的无穷无尽的力量，在党的领导下，一定能够将理想变成现实，扫除保守派的悲观论调。
    推广双轮双铧犁一定要采取亲自试验，典型示范，参观表演，用事实说服群众的方法；一定要帮助群众掌握技术，创造顺利使用双轮双铧犁的条件；一定要继续在不同条件下继续进行试验；对于农具手进行正确的选择和认真的训练。放任自流，或者简单化的不根据具体条件而盲目追求推广的数字也是不对的。
    历史的经验告诉我们，是不是站在群众前头去领导群众，这是考验党的领导、考验每个共产党员的重要关键，我们应该站在群众的前面去领导群众而不要迁就群众中落后的情绪，坚定地支持先进的与新生的事物，推动生产力的发展。这就是在推广双轮双铧犁这件工作中我们应该吸取的重要教训。
