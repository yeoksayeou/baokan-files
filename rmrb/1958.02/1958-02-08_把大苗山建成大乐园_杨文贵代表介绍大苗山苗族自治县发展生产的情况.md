I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now I will give a brief report to the congress on the afforestation and greening work of the Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County in Guangxi Province.

The Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County is located in the northeast corner of Guangxi Province, at the southernmost end of the Miao Mountains. It has a vast area with a sparse population, fertile land, abundant rainfall, and a mild climate. The vegetation is evergreen all year round, making it ideal for developing forestry. However, before liberation, bandits, despots, landlords, rich peasants, and unscrupulous merchants and officials colluded to carry out the most barbarous and cruel oppression and exploitation of the ethnic minorities. The vast majority of the barren hills and more than 70% of the timber were controlled by them, while the working people lived a life of semi-starvation and poverty. A mountain song was widely circulated locally: "Ethnic minorities suffer much, tears flow like rivers when their suffering is mentioned. Three people share a pot of rice during the day, and five people share a quilt at night." This is a depiction of the tragic life of the past. Under such circumstances, production could never develop. Only after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, did the working people become the masters of the country, making it possible to develop and utilize the rich natural resources, turn dead treasures into living treasures, develop mountain production, support national industrial construction, and improve people's lives.

	The Autonomous County Fully Mobilizes, Achieving Greening Four Years Ahead of Schedule

In our autonomous county, there are a variety of timber forests, mainly cedar, as well as economic forests such as oil-tea camellia, tung oil trees, mushroom wood, tea trees, fruit trees, eucommia, and cork oak. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile fields and more than 120 kinds of local specialties. The main way to develop production is forestry. Therefore, in the five years since the establishment of the autonomous county, we have widely mobilized the masses to carry out afforestation, forestry, and forest protection. The county has used about 4.5 million labor days to complete 654,422 mu of afforestation (mostly cedar), exceeding the afforestation target of the first five-year plan by 10%, and basically meeting the standards and quality, with a survival rate of over 96%. The vast majority is afforestation with complete land preparation, planting tung oil trees in combination with cedar, which can also harvest miscellaneous grains. It is exactly: "Three years of miscellaneous grains, four years of tung oil, ten years of cedar cover the mountains." This not only increases current income, but also strengthens the care of young forests, promotes the growth of young forests, and shortens the time to maturity (generally it takes 25 to 30 years to mature, but full land preparation only takes 18 to 25 years), combining timber forests and economic forests, solving the problem of current and long-term interests. In the process of afforestation and forest cultivation, we successfully experimented with four-season afforestation in the Dong'an Forestry Cooperative, and it has been effectively promoted in many townships and cooperatives. At the same time, we organized about 600,000 labor days to comprehensively prune more than 300,000 mu of existing forests, cutting down wild vines and miscellaneous trees, changing the past phenomenon of allowing miscellaneous trees and wild vines to climb and compete for survival. We also continuously carried out cultivation, soil loosening, and weeding work on 200,000 mu of young forests that were not fully prepared, using more than 1.2 million labor days. In this way, through comprehensive pruning, cultivation, and other measures, we can promote faster growth and better quality of the trees. Due to large-scale publicity and education on fire prevention and forest protection, taking various effective measures, relying on the masses, and widely carrying out forest protection and fire prevention work, forest fires have decreased year by year, and more than 85% of the townships have basically achieved no fires for five years. We also pay enough attention to planned logging, mountain pulling, and transportation work. In five years, we sold more than 627,000 cubic meters of high-grade building timber to the state (missing the materials of one district). Since the second half of last year, like all provinces and cities around the nation, we have gone through the counterattack against illegal landlords and rich peasants and the socialist debate in the countryside, and the socialist consciousness of the people has greatly improved. The publication of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has further encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses, and revolutionary vigor has soared unprecedentedly. All these favorable factors have promoted a great leap forward in the development of forestry production. The county still has 920,000 mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation, which will all be afforested in the next few years. This year, the county plans to afforest 500,000 mu, nearly doubling the amount in 1957. Eighty-two townships will be completely greened. The whole county has launched a comprehensive mobilization, formulated plans, and assigned responsibility areas. In addition to township and cooperative plans, joint township and joint cooperative efforts have been organized to cooperate closely, support each other, eliminate large areas of barren hills, and accelerate greening. Currently, regardless of male or female labor, people are carrying rice and bedding to the mountains to set up shelters and carry out crash afforestation. Judging from the current enthusiasm of the masses and the progress of the movement, 500,000 mu will definitely be overfulfilled. In this way, it is possible to basically green the entire county in 1959, completing the original plan to green the county in 1963 four years ahead of schedule.

	Agriculture Must Also Leap Forward, Aiming to Become a Surplus Grain County This Year

After greening, the county will have about 1.1 million mu of cedar timber forests, estimated to produce an average of at least 20 cubic meters of timber per mu, totaling 22 million cubic meters. With a 30-year rotation period, after 15 years, an average of 730,000 cubic meters can be harvested annually, with an annual income of 23.36 million yuan at current values, averaging 106 yuan per person per year based on the current population. There are also primitive forests in Jiuwandashan, Yuanbaoshan, Gunbeilaoshan, and Sijianshan, with reserves of more than 3 million cubic meters, which are now being actively prepared for felling. In addition, there are nearly 1 million mu of miscellaneous firewood mountains waiting to be utilized or converted into timber forests, which can also increase a lot of income. In terms of other economic forests, based on the current situation and future planting, it is planned that in ten years, the average annual output of tea seeds may be 5,000 dan, tung oil seeds 72,000 dan, tea 37,000 dan, fragrant mushrooms 2,500 dan, square paper 87,500 dan, and Nan bamboo 200,000.

In addition to forestry, the Great Miao Mountain is a source of water and fertilizer, which is extremely beneficial to the development of agriculture. This year, it can become a surplus grain county. One seedling transforming into two seedlings has been fully successful. Even the high-altitude cold mountain areas located on the ridge of the Miao Mountains have also achieved a bumper harvest of two seedlings. It is also particularly worth mentioning that many districts and townships have changed to using glutinous rice and japonica rice seeds for the second crop, which has increased production significantly compared to other commonly used second crop varieties, and is now being fully promoted. Therefore, not only in the development of forestry, achieving a great leap forward, but also in agriculture, we are fully confident of completing and completing ahead of schedule the task of 800 jin per mu. Other economic crops, fruit trees, under-forest crops, animal husbandry, etc., also have great development potential. As long as we use the spirit of revolution from beginning to end, think boldly, act boldly, fully mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and rely on the wisdom and endless strength of the working masses, it can definitely be done. With the leadership of the Party and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, it is the fundamental guarantee to overcome all difficulties and complete or overfulfill all tasks.

	Arriving at Great Miao Mountain is Like Entering a Paradise, Conquering Nature in the Songs of Labor

Now when you enter Great Miao Mountain, you will see many five-column wooden buildings, large and small new villages built along both sides of the Beijiang River by the people with their own manpower, materials, and financial resources. The daily necessities and production tools of each family are complete, the children are very healthy, the dresses of the girls are so exquisite, the endless stream of wooden rafts are transported downstream along the river, and the majestic sounds of pulling wood in the valley are constantly transmitted. When celebrating the Miao New Year, at night, the beautiful and loud sounds of Lusheng come from mountain villages far and near, and the echoes in the valley come together, making it even more rhythmic, as if the entire Great Miao Mountain is holding a song and dance party. Seeing and hearing all this, one knows without asking that the people of all ethnic groups in Great Miao Mountain have undergone fundamental changes in all aspects under the leadership of the Party, and are now continuing to move forward along the road of building socialism. The 50,000-kilowatt Beijiang River Hydropower Station is being prepared for construction. In a few years, there will be green mountains, clear waters, birds singing, and flowers fragrant. Cars will climb to the top of Miao Mountain, and steamships will also enter the mountain.

For the great future, more than 200,000 working people in the county have formed an unstoppable labor army, marching towards nature with overwhelming force. We have firm confidence and determination to guarantee the realization of the Party's call—to build the mountainous area into a socialist paradise.

　　把大苗山建成大乐园
    杨文贵代表介绍大苗山苗族自治县发展生产的情况
    我完全同意李先念副总理，薄一波副总理，彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任所作的各个报告，现在我就广西省大苗山苗族自治县造林绿化工作向大会作简要汇报。
    大苗山苗族自治县，位于广西省的东北角，苗岭山脉的尽南端，地广人稀，土地肥沃，雨量充沛，气候温和，草木四季常青，最适宜发展林业。但解放前，土匪恶霸、地主富农、奸商官吏结成一体，对少数民族人民进行最野蛮最残酷的压迫和剥削，绝大部分的荒山，和百分之七十以上的木材，都掌握在他们的手中，劳动人民却过着半饥饿的贫困生活，当地普遍地流传着这样一首山歌：“少数民族苦情多，提起苦来泪成河，白天三人共筒米，晚上五人共被窝”，这是过去人们悲惨生活的写照。那样情况，生产是绝不会发展的，只有解放后，在党的领导下，劳动人民成为国家的主人，才有可能开发、利用丰富的自然资源，变死宝为活宝，发展山区生产，支援国家工业建设，改善人民生活。
    自治县全面总动员　提前四年实现绿化
    在我们自治县，有以杉木为主的多种多样的用材林，和油茶、油桐、菌木、茶叶、果树、杜仲、栓皮栎等经济林，有数十万亩良田，有一百二十多种土特产品，发展生产的途径主要是林业，因此自治县成立后，五年来，我们广泛的发动群众，开展造林、育林、护林，全县已经用去四百五十万左右的劳动日，完成六十五万四千四百二十二亩的造林任务（大部是杉木），超额完成第一个五年计划造林任务的百分之十，并且基本合乎规格质量，成活率达到百分之九十六以上，绝大部分是全垦造林，杉木兼种油桐，又可收杂粮。正是：“三年杂粮，四年桐，十年杉木满山岗”。这样，既能增加当年收入，又能加强对幼林的护理，促进幼林生长，缩短成材时间（一般要二十五年至三十年才成材，全垦只用十八年至二十五年就可成材），把用材林和经济林结合起来，解决了目前利益和长远利益的问题。在造林和育林的过程中，我们在洞安林业合作社，试验四季造林成功，并且已在许多乡社推广有效。同时，我们曾组织了六十万左右的劳动日，对三十多万亩原有树林进行全面修枝，砍除野藤杂树，改变过去那种任凭杂树野藤攀登互相竞争生存的现象。又对那些不经过全垦的二十万亩的幼林，连续进行中耕松土、除草等抚育工作，共用去劳动日一百二十万之多。这样，通过全面的修井、中耕等措施，能促使林木成长快，材质好。由于大规模的开展对防火护林的宣传教育，采取各种有效措施，依靠群众，广泛地开展护林防火工作，森林火灾逐年下降，已有百分之八十五以上的乡做到五年基本无火灾。在计划砍伐、拉山、放运工作上，也给予足够的重视。在五年内，共售给国家的高级建筑用材，达六十二万七千多立方公尺（缺一个区的材料）。去年下半年以来，我们跟全省、全国各地一样，经过了对不法地主、富农的反击和农村的社会主义大辩论，人民群众社会主义觉悟大大提高。全国农业发展纲要
  （修正草案）公布后，更鼓舞了广大干部和群众的革命积极性，革命干劲空前高涨。这一切有利的因素，促使林业生产的发展来了一个大跃进。全县尚有九十二万亩宜林荒山，要在最近几年内全部造上林。今年全县计划造林五十万亩，比一九五七年增加将近二倍。将有八十二个乡全部绿化。全县已经进行全面的总动员，制订规划，分配责任区，除了乡、社规划外，还组织了联乡、联社，通力协作，互相支援，消灭大片荒山，提前绿化。目前不分男女劳动力，都扛米背被窝上山搭棚住宿，突击开荒造林。据当前群众的劲头和运动的进展看来，五十万亩一定会超额完成的。这样有可能在一九五九年就可基本全县绿化，把原来打算在一九六三年绿化全县的计划要提前四年完成。
    农业也要大跃进　今年要成余粮县
    绿化后，全县将共有杉木用材林约一百一十万亩，估计最低每亩平均产木材二十个立方公尺，合计为二千二百万立方公尺，以三十年为轮伐期，十五年后，每年平均能砍伐七十三万立方公尺，以现在价值计算，每年收入二千三百三十六万元，按现有人口平均每人每年收入一百零六元。还有九万大山、元宝山、滚背老山、四简山等处原始森林，储蓄量也在三百万立方公尺以上，现在，正在积极准备开伐中。此外，尚有近一百万亩左右的杂柴山，正等待利用或改种用材林，这一切，也能够增加许多收入。在其他经济林方面，根据现有情况加上今后种植，计划十年后，可能平均年产茶籽五千担，桐籽七万二千担，茶叶三万七千担，香菌二千五百担，方纸八万七千五百担，南竹二十万根。
    除林业外，大苗山是个水源山，是个肥料山，对于发展农业也是极其有利的。今年可以做到余粮县。一苗变两苗，已经全面成功，连位于苗岭山脊上的高寒山区也获得二苗丰收，还特别值得提出的，有许多区乡，二苗改用糯禾与粳禾种子，比其他通用二苗品种增产很多，现在正在全面推广中。因此，不单独在林业发展方面，实现大跃进，在农业方面也完全有把握完成和提前完成亩产八百斤的任务，其他如经济作物，果树，林下作物，畜牧业等等，也有很大发展。只要自始至终的用革命的精神，大胆的想，大胆的干，充分发动群众，组织群众，依靠劳动群众的智慧和无穷无尽的力量，一定可以做到的，有了党的领导和群众的革命干劲，是克服一切困难，完成或超额完成一切任务的根本保证。
    到了大苗山好像进乐园　劳动歌声中征服大自然
    现在当你进入大苗山就会看到沿着贝江河两岸，人们用自己的人力，物力，财力新建起来的许多五柱木材楼房，大小不等的新的村庄，各个家庭的日常用具和生产工具都很齐全，孩子们都很健康，姑娘们的衣裙是那样的讲究，川流不息的木排，沿江下运，山谷里拉木头的雄壮声音不断的传来，当过苗年的时候，晚上，幽美宏亮的芦笙声，由远近不一的山庄吹来，和那山谷的回音凑在一块，显得更有节奏，似乎整个大苗山在举行歌舞晚会一样，见闻这一切，不问自知大苗山各族人民在党的领导下，各方面已经起了根本变化，现在正在沿着建设社会主义的道路上继续迈步前进。五万瓩的贝江河水力发电站，正在准备兴建中。数年后，真是青山绿水，鸟语花香，汽车爬到苗山顶，汽船也要进山冲。
    为了伟大的未来，全县二十多万劳动人民已组成一支锐不可当的劳动大军，以排山倒海之势向大自然进军，我们具有坚强的信心和决心，保证实现党的号召——把山区建设成为社会主义的乐园。
