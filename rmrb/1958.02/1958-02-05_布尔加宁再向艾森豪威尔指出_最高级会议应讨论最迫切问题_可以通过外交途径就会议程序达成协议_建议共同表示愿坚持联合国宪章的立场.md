Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS reported from Moscow on the 3rd: In his latest letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin pointed out that Moscow welcomed with satisfaction the U.S. President's expression of willingness to meet with Soviet leaders and leaders of other relevant countries. The letter also noted that Eisenhower also agreed with the Soviet Union's hope for the success of the highest-level meeting. It is with this desire that the Soviet government suggests that the participants in the meeting focus on the most pressing issues, issues that, based on the attitudes already expressed by various countries, give some confidence that a positive resolution can be achieved at present.

Bulganin's letter was delivered to the U.S. State Department on February 2nd by the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in the United States.

In his letter, Bulganin pointed out that the meeting could reach agreement on the procedures for discussing those issues (currently difficult to resolve) that will be addressed in the next stage of talks. Bulganin expressed his conviction that this gradual approach to resolving international problems is the most realistic and successful approach under current conditions. Even reaching agreement on individual issues initially would create favorable preconditions for resolving other outstanding issues.

The letter pointed out that while the U.S. President agreed to discuss the issues raised by the Soviet Union at the meeting, he also preemptively indicated that he did not believe it was beneficial or necessary to reach agreement on issues such as: the proposal that the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union renounce the use of nuclear weapons, the proposal that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization conclude a non-aggression pact, and the proposal that force not be used in resolving issues in the Middle East and Near East. His excuse was that the obligations stipulated in the above proposals are already included in the obligations that the UN Charter imposes on its member states. He also used this excuse as a basis to deny the Soviet Union's proposal that the Soviet Union and the United States firmly express their desire to develop friendly and peaceful cooperative relations.

Bulganin wrote that if the U.S. government believes it is impossible and inappropriate to accept the proposal regarding a firm expression of willingness by the Soviet Union and the United States to develop friendly and peaceful cooperation between the two countries, "this situation can only cause us deep regret."

The letter stated, "We believe that the current unsatisfactory state of relations between the two countries is by no means a necessity, and there are fully sufficient practical conditions to improve it, as evidenced by the cultural, technical, and educational exchange agreement recently signed by representatives of our two countries."

The letter said that we cannot help but feel disappointed that our proposal to take new and important steps on this path is rejected under the pretext of the UN Charter, an excuse that is clearly artificial.

Bulganin wrote that the implementation of the measures we have proposed will help consolidate the United Nations, helping it to truly become an effective organization for defending peace. If one consistently stands on the position of the UN Charter, one must first eliminate military blocs. The letter emphasized that since Western countries are currently unwilling to take this step, the Soviet government suggests making a joint resolution expressing a firm willingness to adhere to the UN Charter and unremittingly implement measures that can guarantee the security of all nations.

Bulganin then pointed out that Eisenhower's letter essentially suggests abandoning the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council, a principle on which the United Nations is based. The Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman emphasized that abolishing the principle of unanimity among the great powers would lead to abuse of power, damage to the interests of the minority, and the use of the United Nations to serve a particular country or group of countries. Departing from the principle of unanimity among the great powers would not only fail to strengthen the United Nations, but would instead harm the organization, ultimately leading to its collapse... If one truly wants to make the United Nations an effective organization for international cooperation, rather than a tool in the hands of advocates of the "position of strength" policy, then such a practice cannot be tolerated.

Bulganin said that as for the issue of the situation in Eastern European countries mentioned by the U.S. President, the Soviet government's position on this issue does not need to be explained, and any dispute over this issue is of no benefit.

The letter expressed firm belief that the interests of consolidating world peace require "all of us to dedicate ourselves to solving those problems that can create conditions for the development of peaceful cooperation among the peoples of all countries. It is not permissible for some people to raise issues that attempt to divert us from the truly important issues of defending peace, thereby poisoning international relations."

Regarding the U.S. President's opinions on the issue of disarmament in the letter, Bulganin wrote, "Of course, we do not deny the importance of the issue of only using outer space for peaceful purposes, that is, first and foremost, the importance of prohibiting intercontinental ballistic missiles with hydrogen warheads." However, this issue can only be discussed as part of the overall issue of prohibiting nuclear and rocket weapons. If Western countries agree to discuss the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the cessation of testing these weapons, and the removal of foreign military bases in other countries, then the Soviet Union, in order to consolidate peace and reach a disarmament agreement, is also prepared to discuss the issue of intercontinental rockets.

As for the U.S. President's belief that a meeting of foreign ministers should be held before the high-level meeting, and that the convening of the high-level meeting actually depends on the outcome of the foreign ministers' meeting, Bulganin wrote: "Considering the positions preemptively adopted by some possible participants in the foreign ministers' meeting, it is difficult to believe that the foreign ministers' meeting will not add obstacles to the convening of the high-level meeting and bury this urgent and important issue from the very beginning." The letter is confident that if an agreement can be reached to hold a high-level meeting, then the procedures and other issues related to implementing this agreement will not be difficult to resolve. These issues can be agreed upon through ordinary diplomatic channels.

### 布尔加宁再向艾森豪威尔指出  最高级会议应讨论最迫切问题  可以通过外交途径就会议程序达成协议  建议共同表示愿坚持联合国宪章的立场

　　布尔加宁再向艾森豪威尔指出
    最高级会议应讨论最迫切问题
    可以通过外交途径就会议程序达成协议
    建议共同表示愿坚持联合国宪章的立场
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在给美国总统艾森豪威尔的最新的一封信中指出，莫斯科满意地欢迎美国总统关于愿意同苏联领导人和其他有关国家领导人会谈的表示。信中还指出，艾森豪威尔也赞同苏联希望最高级会议成功这一观点。苏联政府正是本着这种愿望建议，会议参加者集中注意于这样一些最迫切的问题，即根据各国已经表示的态度使人在一定程度上相信目前可以得到积极解决的问题。
    布尔加宁的这一封信已经由苏联驻美国代办在2月2日递交给美国国务院。
    布尔加宁在信中指出，会议可以就下一阶段会谈所要讨论的那些问题（目前尚难解决的问题）的程序达成协议。布尔加宁表示确信，对国际问题这种逐步解决办法是目前条件下最现实的、可以保证成功的办法。最初那怕是就个别问题达成协议也会给解决其他悬而未决的问题创造有利的前提。
    信中指出，美国总统一方面表示同意在会上讨论苏联所提出的问题，另一方面又预先暗示：他不认为就下列这样一些问题达成协议是有益的或必要的，例如：美、英、苏三国放弃使用核武器的建议，北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约缔约国缔结互不侵犯协定的建议，以及在解决中近东问题时不使用武力的建议。他的借口是，上述建议所规定的义务已经包括在联合国宪章给它的会员国所规定的义务中。他还用这个借口作为根据，来否定苏联主张苏联和美国坚定表示希望发展友好与和平合作关系的建议。
    布尔加宁写道，如果美国政府认为不可能和不宜于接受关于苏美两国坚定表示愿意发展两国间友好与和平合作的建议，“这种情况只能使我们深感遗憾”。
    信中写道，“我们认为，目前两国关系的不能令人满意的状况决不是出于什么必要，完全有充分的实际条件使它改善，最近我们两国代表签订的文化、技术和教育交流协定就是明证”。
    信中说，我们不能不感到失望的是，我们主张在这条道路上采取新的重要步骤的建议被人借口有联合国宪章而加以拒绝，这种借口显然是人为的。
    布尔加宁写道，实现我们所提出的措施，将有助于联合国的巩固，帮助它真正成为保卫和平的有效机构。如果是始终一贯地站在联合国宪章的立场上，就首先必须消除军事集团。信中强调说，既然西方国家目前还不愿意采取这个步骤，所以苏联政府建议作出共同的决议，表明坚决愿意坚持联合国宪章的立场并且不懈地实行能够保障各国人民安全的措施。
    布尔加宁接着指出，艾森豪威尔的信实质上是建议放弃安全理事会中的大国一致原则，而这个原则是联合国赖以生存的基础。苏联部长会议主席着重指出，废除大国一致的原则就会导致滥用职权、破坏少数的利益和利用联合国来效力于某个国家或国家集团。离开大国一致的原则不仅不能加强联合国，相反只会损害这个组织，最后使它陷于崩溃……如果真正想使联合国成为国际合作的有效机构，而不是成为“实力地位”政策拥护者手中的工具，那末这种做法是决不能容许的。
    布尔加宁说，至于美国总统所提到的关于东欧国家局势的问题，苏联政府对这个问题的立场是用不着解释的，对这个问题的任何争论是没有什么益处的。
    信中表示坚信，巩固世界和平的利益要求“我们全体致力于解决那些能够为发展各国人民和平合作创造条件的问题，有人提出一些问题，想使我们离开保卫和平的真正重要问题借以毒化国际关系，这是不能容许的”。
    关于美国总统信中对裁军问题的意见，布尔加宁写道，“当然，我们并不否认关于只能和平利用星际空间问题的重要性，也就是说，首先是禁止带氢弹头的洲际弹道火箭问题的重要性”。但是，这个问题只能作为禁止核武器和火箭武器总的问题的一部分来讨论。如果西方国家同意商讨禁止原子武器和氢武器、停止试验这些武器和撤销在他国境内的外国军事基地等问题，那么苏联为了巩固和平和达成裁军协议，也准备讨论洲际火箭问题。
    至于美国总统认为在高级会议之前应该举行外长会谈，并且认为高级会议的召开实际上取决于外长会谈的结果，布尔加宁写道：“如果考虑到外长会议某些可能的参加者预先所采取的立场，则很难相信外长会谈不会给召开高级会谈增添障碍和使这个迫切的重要问题一开始就被葬送掉”。信中确信，如果能够达成举行高级会议的协议，那末有关实行这项协议的程序和其他问题就不难解决了。这些问题可以按普通外交手续达成协议。
