　　Striving Forward with Wings!
　　Ge De
    Reading the February 1st People's Daily, I couldn't help but think of "flying." The headline news said: "Although it is still the season of severe winter and the beginning of the year, the prelude to the great leap forward in economic construction in the first year of the second five-year plan has already begun." Reminded by "severe winter and the beginning of the year," I suddenly realized that spring had actually arrived. Although I don't know if this spring has feet, or if there is such a thing as "the footsteps of spring," spring has indeed arrived, and right before us is "立春" (the Start of Spring).
    I feel that this year's spring didn't walk in, but flew in. In that case, time should have wings. On second thought, it seems that everything in our country has grown wings. And time seems to be racing with them: all things are leaping forward; time is also leaping forward. Isn't this "Start of Spring" arriving suddenly while people are too busy to receive it?
    In the past, the relationship between time and space has never seemed so subtle as it does now, and it has never evoked such bizarre illusions in our minds as it does now. For example, looking at the changes in the things around us, every day, we feel like we have lived many years. Many people probably feel the same way. The Shanxi Province representatives to the First National People's Congress gave an example to prove that the farmers there have done in one year what their ancestors did in thousands of years. From the perspective of time change, a winter seems like only a moment; it seems like we haven't even seen the sun set, and it seems like we haven't even gone to sleep, yet spring has arrived, surpassing winter. If we look at the changes in people, the elimination of lethargy and the invigoration of spirit make us feel even more energetic than in previous years. This is probably what some people call "the younger you get"; time seems to be flowing backward. It's the same time, but the feeling of it is different before and after: in the days of suffering, we felt that every day was like a year, but in the high tide of construction, we felt that every year was like a day.
    What is the reason for this? I think it lies in people's attitude towards it. People in suffering are consuming time; in a heroic and vigorous undertaking, they are rushing to cross it. This "rushing to cross" is also seen in the newspapers. I remember that in the rectification of state organs, someone put forward the slogan of not building bridges but rushing to cross. Now everything is being rushed to cross. The representatives to the National People's Congress said: "See five years in three years, see three years in the first year, this conference should make the first year of the second five-year plan a good start." This is a sign of "rushing to cross." They also said: If we work hard for three years, we can quickly change the face of the motherland. This hard work for three years is also rushing to cross. In fact, rushing to cross started a long time ago, and we have rushed through this winter: we have given wings to all kinds of things and driven them to leap forward.
    However, time itself is also flying. From the past of days like years to today's years like days, doesn't this prove the leap of time? One year, three years, five years, and even fifteen years, will all fly by like this. We cannot stop time, but we can make it leave more splendid and magnificent traces in this world. Therefore, we must use hard work to rush to cross. The People's Daily editorial said: "Don't be afraid of slow steps in the past, but be afraid of not catching up quickly." (February 1st) We have already accelerated the pace of progress, but time is moving faster. To beat this time, we must also muster our own wings.
    People can grow wings. The people's representatives said: "The great rectification and the anti-rightist struggle have given unexpected great effect to the human factor and the political factor in economic construction. The spirit of the people across the country to strive forward is like a torrent, promoting the great development of socialist cause." These "people with unexpectedly great effect" and "the spirit of striving forward" are precisely our wings. A winter's struggle has tempered our wings, and facing the spring of "the first year," we must strive forward with even greater courage. This is heroic, glorious, and happy, but it is also a hard battle. Let us fly up - let's have a great leap forward in thought. The three years of hard work have begun, but three years is only a moment in history, because the Chinese Communists' more than 30 years of hard work are only "like a day." Happiness is calling to us, and we are striving forward towards it with wings.

### 奋翼前进！

　　奋翼前进！
　　葛德
    读着2月1日的人民日报，不由的便想到了“飞”。那头条新闻里说：“现在虽然还是严冬岁首的季节，但是这第二个五年计划第一年的经济建设大跃进的序幕已经揭开了。”由于“严冬岁首”的提醒，我猛然悟到春其实已经来了。我虽然不知道这春到底有没有脚，也不知道到底有没有所谓“春天的脚步”，但是春天毕竟是来了，眼前就是“立春”。
    我觉得今年的春天不是走来的，而是飞来的。那末，时间应该是有翅膀的了。又一想，在我们国家里，好像什么都已长出了翅膀。而时间又好像在同它们赛跑：各种事物都在跃进；时间也在跃进。这“立春”不就是在人们不暇接待中突然到来的吗？
    以往，时间同空间的关系，都没有现在的显得这样微妙，它也从没有在我们的头脑中，引起过现在这样离奇的幻觉。比如，看看周围的事物的变化，每一天，我们觉得是等于过了许多年。大概有许多人会有同感的。第一届全国人民代表大会的山西省代表就举例证明：他们那里的农民，在一年时间内已经干了祖先们几千年干的事情。从时间的变化上，一个冬天，又觉得似乎只是一刹那，我们好像还没有看到过太阳落，连觉似乎也还没有去睡过，然而，春天却越过冬天到来了。如果看看人的变化呢？暮气的扫除，精神的奋发，反觉精力更胜往年，这大概就是有些人所说的那“越过越年轻”；时间又似乎是在倒流的。同样是时间，对它的感觉前后也有不同：在苦难的日月里，觉得度日如年，在建设的高潮中却又觉得度年如日。
    原因在哪里？我以为在于人们对它的态度。人在苦难中，对于时间是一种消磨；在豪迈蓬勃的事业中，却是一种抢渡。这“抢渡”，也是从报纸上看到的。记得是在国家机关的整改中，有人提出了不要搭桥要抢渡的口号。现在是连什么都在抢渡了。全国人民代表大会的代表们说：“五年看三年，三年看头年，这次大会要使第二个五年计划的第一年来一个好开端。”这就是要“抢渡”的表示，他们又说：苦战三年，我们就能使祖国的面貌迅速改观。这苦战三年，也就是抢渡。其实抢渡又是老早就开始了的，这一个冬天，我们就是抢渡过来的：我们曾给各种事物安上翅膀驱使它们飞跃前进。
    然而，时间本身也在飞动。从过去的度日如年，一变而为今天的度年如日，不就证明着时间的飞跃。一年、三年、五年，乃至十五年，都会这样的飞去。我们无法使时间停留，我们却能要它在这世界上留下更为绚烂壮丽的痕迹。于是我们必须用苦战来抢渡。人民日报的社论说：“不怕过去脚步迟缓，而怕不急起直追。”（2月1日）我们已经加快了前进的脚步了，然而时间前进得更快些，要赛过这时间，我们也要鼓起自己的翅膀来才行。
    人是可以生出翅膀来的，人民代表们说过：“伟大的整风和反右派斗争，使人的因素和政治的因素在经济建设中发挥了意想不到的伟大作用，全国人民奋发前进的情绪就像一股激流一样，推动着社会主义事业的大发展。”这有着“意想不到的伟大作用的人”和“奋发前进的情绪”，不正就是我们的翅膀。一个冬天的奋斗，锻炼了我们的翅膀，迎着“头年”的春天，我们要更加鼓翼奋勇前进。这是豪迈、光荣、幸福，但也是苦战。让我们飞起来吧——来一个思想的大跃进。三年苦战开始了，然而三年在历史上也不过是一瞬间，因为中国共产党人三十多年的苦战，也不过只是“如一日”的。幸福在向我们招唤，我们朝它奋翼前进。
