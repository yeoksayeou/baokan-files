　　Try to Buy the Same Fabric When Making Clothes

　　Xu Shuzhen is a mother of eight children. Her husband's monthly salary is more than seventy yuan. This money has to support ten people, and four children go to school (one in middle school and three in elementary school). In a place like Beijing, it's really tight. But Xu Shuzhen is a thrifty and capable housekeeper who arranges the family in an orderly manner. Not only does she not run a deficit, but she can also save three or five yuan a month. Here are a couple of small things to talk about:
    When her family adds clothes for the children, they always try to buy the same color fabric. Xu Shuzhen said that this has several advantages: First, the clothes of the big and small children can be cut together, which can save fabric; second, if the clothes are torn in the future, the broken clothes can be pieced together and altered for the younger ones to wear; third, the leftover pieces of fabric from tailoring can be used uniformly. Her family, adults and children, wear dozens of pairs of shoes a year, and they have never bought shoe upper fabric. They are all made by piecing together small pieces of fabric left over from tailoring clothes.
    Xu Shuzhen never throws away socks that are too worn to wear. She unravels the torn socks into yarn, twists them into thread, and uses them to make shoe soles. She even takes out the cotton from the cotton shoes that the children have worn out and saves it for reuse.
    Xu Shuzhen often says to people: "When I think of the days before liberation, I still feel sad. Now a family of ten can eat enough and dress warmly, but we can't forget our roots when life is better." In order to reduce the burden on the country, Xu Shuzhen decided to stop applying for tuition subsidies for her children starting this year.

### 做衣服尽量买同一种布

　　做衣服尽量买同一种布
    许淑贞是八个孩子的妈妈。她爱人每月工资收入七十多元。这些钱要养活十口人，还有四个孩子上学（一个上中学，三个上小学），在北京这样的地方，可真是够紧的了。可是许淑贞是位勤俭持家的能手，把家里安排得井井有条，不但不拉亏空，每月还能储蓄三、五块钱。这里不妨列举一两件小事来谈谈：
    他们家给孩子们添衣服的时候，总是尽量买一色的布。许淑贞说这有几个好处：第一、大小孩子的衣服套着裁，能节省布；第二、将来衣服穿破了，把几件破衣拼凑在一起，还能给小的改着穿；第三、裁衣剩下来的布块，好统一安排用处。他家大人孩子一年要穿几十双鞋，从来没有买过鞋面布，都是利用裁衣服剩下的小布块拼凑着做的。
    许淑贞从来不肯把破得不能穿的袜子扔掉。她把破袜子拆成纱，搓成线，纳鞋底用。甚至孩子们穿破了的棉鞋，她也要把棉花拆出来，留着再用。
    许淑贞常对人说：“想起解放前的日子，到现在还心酸。现在一家十口，吃得饱，穿得暖，可是日子好了也不能忘本。”为了减轻国家的负担，许淑贞决定从今年开始，不再给孩子们申请学费补助了。
