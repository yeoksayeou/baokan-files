To Support the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture in a Spirit of Promotion
    Tractor Factory Strives to Go Into Production Ahead of Schedule
    (Our newspaper, Luoyang, 2nd dispatch) The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, with the revolutionary spirit of the promotion faction, has revised its plant construction schedule and decided to go into full production three quarters ahead of schedule. In the second half of next year, it will produce the Dongfanghong (East is Red) -54 tractor, and increase the production of other types of small tractors by thousands to support agricultural production. At present, all employees of the plant are carrying out various tasks in an organized and planned manner, adhering to the general line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in building socialism. Production and auxiliary power workshops will soon be put into production one after another. All cadres in the plant have begun to study various technical materials. Relevant departments have begun to carefully check and review various basic data to ensure complete accuracy. The technical department is working on translating, reviewing and reproducing all product drawings that have arrived at the factory to ensure the needs. Various tool manufacturing workshops are carrying out the production of thousands of non-standard equipment. Material staff have formulated a plan for substitute materials, requiring reliable sources to be found for the production and auxiliary materials of all tractors. The technical inspection, warehouse transportation, and service system departments are all studying how to serve the upcoming large-scale production.
    During the revision of the above plan, the tractor factory also accepted the national task of refitting Dongfanghong -54 tractors and the trial production of 16-horsepower tractors. The trial production of the 16-horsepower tractor is based on existing drawings to implement the principle of being economical and practical, modifying the design to use cheap coal instead of oil as fuel, and requiring a low price and wide use, for power generation, water lifting, plowing, and harvesting. The trial production of this type of tractor has already begun, and twenty units can be produced by the end of the year.

    拖拉机厂在修订上面计划期间，还接受了国家交给的改装德特54型拖拉机和十六马力拖拉机的试制任务。对十六马力拖拉机的试制，是参照现成图纸贯彻既经济又适用的原则来修改设计，要求能用价钱便宜的煤炭代替油料作燃料，而且要求售价便宜，用途广，能用来发电、车水、耕种、收割。现在这种拖拉机的试制工作已经开始，到年底可以出产二十台。
