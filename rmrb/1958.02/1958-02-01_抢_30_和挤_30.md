　　Snatching "30" and Squeezing "30"
　　Zhou Zhizhong
    This is a number-counting game played by two people. During the game, the two players take turns counting, from 1 to 30 (or more), with each person saying at least one number and at most two numbers each time (if you want to snatch more numbers, you can also stipulate that each person can say more numbers). For example, if A says 1 or 1, 2, then B says 3 or 3, 4; then A continues to say the next number. Whoever snatches the number "30" first is considered the winner. The method of squeezing "30" is the same as snatching "30", but the result is exactly the opposite of what was said above: whoever says the number "30" first loses.
    Many people are familiar with this game, but not everyone knows the secret to winning. Now, let me briefly introduce the method to win:
    The method for snatching "30" is: divide the number to be snatched by the sum of the minimum and maximum number of digits that each person can say. If there is a remainder, the number of the remainder is how many digits you preemptively say from 1 (remainder 1, say 1; remainder 2, say 1, 2;...), and then let the other party continue; if it is evenly divisible, then you do not have to preempt, but let the other party speak first. For example, to snatch "30," and it is stipulated that each person can say at least one number and at most two numbers at a time, then divide 30 by 3, which is evenly divisible without a remainder. At this time, you let the other party speak first, but the number of digits you say must add up to three with the number said by the other party, and the last digit must be 3 or a multiple of 3. For example, if the other party says 1 at the beginning, you say 2, 3; if the other party says 1, 2, you say 3. Then, if the other party says 4, you say 5, 6; if the other party says 4, 5, you say 6. Below, as long as you master this trick, and the last number you say each time is 9, 12, 15..., etc., you will definitely be able to snatch "30" first and win. The method to win by snatching other numbers is the same.
    The method to win by squeezing "30" is exactly the opposite of snatching "30." As long as you know the trick to win by snatching "30", it will not be a problem to turn it around and achieve victory in squeezing "30".

### 抢“30”和挤“30”

　　抢“30”和挤“30”
　　周志忠
    这是两个人在一块比赛数数的游戏。比赛时，两人接连数数，从1数到30（更多的数字也可以），每人每次最少说一个数，最多说两个数（如果抢更多的数字，也可以规定每人多说几个数）。例如，甲说1或1、2，乙就接着说3或3、4；然后甲再接着说下去。如果谁先抢到说“30”这个数，谁就算是取得胜利。挤“30”的方法同抢“30”相同，只是结果与上边说的正相反：谁要先说到“30”这个数，他就失败了。
    这个游戏很多人都熟悉，但取得胜利的秘诀却不是大家都知道的。现在把取胜的方法简单介绍一下：
    抢“30”的方法是：将规定要抢的数，除以每人所能说的数字的最少个数和最多个数的和，如果有余数，余数是几，你就抢先从1起连说几个数字（余1，说1；余2，说1、2；……），然后叫对方接着说；如果除之适尽，那么，你就不必抢先，而让对方先说。如抢“30”，规定每人一次最少说一个数，最多说两个数，就以3除30，适尽无余。这时你就让对方先说，但你所说的数字个数，一定要同对方说的个数凑成三个，而且最后一个数字一定是3或3的倍数。如开始对方说1，你就说2、3；对方说1、2，你就说3。接着，如对方说4，你就说5、6；对方说4、5，你就说6。以下，你只要掌握住这个窍门，每次说的最后一个数是9，12，15……等等，你就一定能先抢到“30”，取得胜利。抢别的数取胜的方法，道理相同。
    挤“30”取胜的方法同抢“30”恰好相反。只要知道了抢“30”取胜的窍门，反过来取得挤“30”的胜利，也就不成问题了。
