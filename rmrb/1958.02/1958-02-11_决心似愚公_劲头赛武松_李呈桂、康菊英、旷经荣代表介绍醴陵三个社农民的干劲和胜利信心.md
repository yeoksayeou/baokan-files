We fully endorse the reports made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Here, let us introduce the current production situation of Baofeng Agricultural Cooperative in Liling County, Hunan Province, and Hongxing and Zhurong Peak Agricultural Cooperatives in Hengshan County.

The land used by our three cooperatives is in hilly areas, close to the mountains, and the natural conditions are not very favorable. However, because we are under the leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and have embarked on the road of socialist cooperation leading to happiness, we have used collective strength to transform nature and overcome disasters within two or three years, so that our production and life are rising day by day. For example, Baofeng Agricultural Cooperative achieved the target of 800 jin of grain per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) eleven years ahead of schedule in 1957. The grain production plan for 1958 is 1,600 jin per mu, which is to double. Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative and Zhurong Peak Agricultural Cooperative are also striving to achieve the goals of 1,100 jin and 800 jin of grain per mu respectively in 1958, ten years ahead of schedule.

In order to achieve this year's grain production target, after enthusiastic discussions among the cooperative members, the enthusiasm is particularly high, and many ideas have been thought of. Everyone says that they are very confident in achieving this target, as long as they are willing to work hard. Therefore, since October last year, our three cooperatives have launched a vigorous farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaign. This movement is large in scale, and the members are full of energy, which has never been seen before. The members of Baofeng Agricultural Cooperative composed a folk song, which fully expresses this revolutionary enthusiasm and confidence in victory. This folk song says:

	Our determination is like Yu Gong,
	Our enthusiasm is like Wu Song,
	Our strength is greater than the sky,
	Our enthusiasm is like a blazing fire;
	Thousands of troops and horses are building water conservancy,
	Moving mountains and overturning seas to show heroism,
	Accumulated fertilizer piles up like mountains,
	We are confident in exceeding production by a thousand catties.

The planning of our cooperatives for this water conservancy project is constantly being revised and expanded, and is constantly being broken through. The achievements already made are very significant: The members of Zhurong Peak Agricultural Cooperative have straightened a small river that was eight bends and four curves and three miles long with their own hands. This river can no longer cross the fields and wash away and submerge the crops that have been planted as in the past. Hongxing and Baofeng Agricultural Cooperatives have also comprehensively renovated the irrigation system this year and realized water conservancy. In the water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movement, many heroic deeds and advanced figures have emerged, so we will not talk about them one by one.

Fellow representatives: When we talk about these achievements, we will naturally and sincerely feel grateful for the wise leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao! On the other hand, we also always remember: Last year—the second year that our country's farmers, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, realized agricultural cooperation, the right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack by taking advantage of our Party's rectification campaign. In our commune, the capitalist elements also cocked their tails, stirred up trouble, and attempted to undermine our commune. At this time, the Party led us to launch the anti-rightist struggle and the rural rectification movement, using the method of extensive airing of views, big contending, and big debate to thoroughly criticize and attack the capitalist elements, and crush the conspiracies of the right-wing elements. Our eyes were also clear, and our cooperative became as solid as iron. This is the solid political and ideological foundation for us to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

We once again express to all the representatives: We have full confidence that we will be able to unite all the members and enable our commune to achieve the grain production target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program this year, and achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production.

    决心似愚公　劲头赛武松
    李呈桂、康菊英、旷经荣代表介绍醴陵三个社农民的干劲和胜利信心
    我们完全拥护彭真副委员长、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任所作的报告。
    在这里让我们介绍一下，我们所在的湖南省醴陵县保丰农业社和衡山县红星、祝融峰农业社当前生产的情况。
    我们这三个社的用土都是在丘陵地区，靠近大山，自然条件并不十分优越。但是，由于我们在伟大的共产党和毛主席的领导下，走上了通向幸福的社会主义的合作化道路，在两、三年工夫之内，我们用集体的力量改造了自然，战胜了灾害，因而使得我们的生产和生活一天天地步步高升。如保丰农业社在一九五七年就提前十一年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产粮食八百斤的指标。一九五八年的粮食产量计划是每亩一千六百斤，要翻一个翻。红星农业社和祝融峰农业社也都在朝着提前十年即在一九五八年分别实现粮食亩产一千一百斤和八百斤的目标奋斗。
    为了达到今年的粮食增产指标，经过社员同志们的热烈讨论，劲头特别大，办法也想得多，大家都说要达到这个指标的把握很大，只要舍得苦干。因此，从去年十月起，我们这三个社都展开了一个热火朝天的兴修农田水利和积肥运动。这个运动规模大，社员们劲头足，都是以前没有看见过的。保丰农业社的社员们编了一支山歌，便充分表达了这种革命干劲和胜利信心。这支山歌说：
    我们的决心似愚公，
    我们的劲头赛武松，
    我们的力量比天大，
    我们的热情像火红；
    千军万马修水利，
    移山倒海逞英雄，
    积得肥来堆如山，
    超产千斤有信心。
    我们几个社这次兴修水利的规划，总是不断修改扩大，又不断被突破。已经取得的成绩是很大的：祝融峰农业社的社员已经把一条八弯四曲三里长的小河，用双手改直了，这条河再也不能像过去一样横田过田地冲毁和淹没种好了的庄稼了。红星和保丰两个农业社今年也已经通盘修整了灌溉系统，实现了水利化。在修水利和积肥运动中，出现了许多的英雄事迹和先进人物，我们就不一个一个来讲了。
    各位代表：当我们讲到这些成就时，我们的心里就会自然而然地、真心地感激伟大的共产党和毛主席的英明领导！而另一方面我们也时刻记得：在去年——我们全国农民在党和毛主席领导下实现了农业合作化的第二年，右派分子乘我们党整风的机会发起了一次疯狂的进攻。在我们社里，资本主义分子也翘起了尾巴，兴风作浪，企图搞垮我们的社。就在这个时候，党领导我们展开了反右派斗争，开展了农村整风运动，用大放大鸣大辩论的办法，彻底地批判和打击了资本主义分子，粉碎了右派分子的阴谋，我们的眼睛也看清楚了，我们的合作社，更是像铁一样的巩固起来了。这就是我们今年实现农业生产大跃进的坚实的政治思想基础。
    我们再一次向各位代表表示：我们有充分信心，一定能够团结全体社员，使我们的社在今年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食产量指标，在农业生产上来一个大跃进。
