　　Jiangsu Peking Opera Troupe's Performances
    The Jiangsu Peking Opera Troupe recently performed “The Pearl Given at Rainbow Bridge” and “The Story of a Soul’s Departure” in Beijing. This troupe was established in 1955, and its predecessor was the Peking Opera team of the cultural troupe of the Southern Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu Military Regions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    “The Pearl Given at Rainbow Bridge” is adapted from "Sizhou City." It removes the irrational mythological elements of the original play, affirms the love between the Water Mother and Bai Yong, and has also made some revisions and improvements in the martial arts aspects. "The Story of a Soul’s Departure" tells the story of Zhang Qianniang and Wang Miao's love, and how her soul eloped because of her father's obstruction, possessing a strong romantic spirit.
    These two plays have won awards at the first Jiangsu Province Opera Observation and Performance Conference. (Yun)

　　江苏京剧团的演出
    江苏省京剧团最近在北京演出了
  “虹桥赠珠”和“离魂记”等剧目。这个剧团成立于1955年，它的前身是中国人民解放军苏南和苏北军区文工团的京剧队。
    “虹桥赠珠”是根据“泗州城”改编的，它去掉了原来剧中神怪不合情理的部分，肯定了水母和白永之间的爱情，在武打方面也作了某些整理加工。“离魂记”是叙述张倩娘和王庙恋爱，因受父亲阻挠而灵魂私奔的故事，具有较强烈的浪漫主义的精神。
    这二个戏在江苏省第一届戏曲观摩演出大会上都曾获奖。（匀）
