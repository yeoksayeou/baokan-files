　　What will the weather be like tomorrow?
　　——Talking about the weather forecast of the Meteorological Observatory
　　Gong Zhongchun
    Will it be windy or snowy tomorrow? This is a matter of daily concern for everyone. Some people with experience in weather will look up at the sky to see what kind of clouds and wind there are to judge the weather for tomorrow. Although relying on experience to look at the sky can tell the weather changes in a short period of time, it is not very accurate after all. The more reliable one is the weather forecast of the meteorological observatory.
    The change of weather is mainly caused by the flow of air. With the operation of the atmosphere, the weather phenomena occurring in one area can often affect areas hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away. For example, if it is snowing heavily in Inner Mongolia today, it is very likely that these snow-laden clouds will come to North China with the airflow tomorrow, causing the Beijing area to snow as well; if there is a cold air current over Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union today, a cold wave is likely to occur in Northeast China in a day or two.
    However, weather changes are not mysterious.
    In many places around the world, whether it is a bustling town or a remote frontier, a hot desert or a grassy grassland, a year-round snow-covered plateau or a basin below sea level, as well as a mountain top often shrouded in clouds and fog or a vast ocean, there are meteorological observatories and stations, where thousands of meteorological workers observe weather changes day and night according to certain procedures and time intervals. In addition to observing clouds, rain, snow... with the naked eye, they also use instruments to observe various meteorological conditions on the ground and in the upper air. After obtaining the observation records, each station sends them to the local meteorological observatory or the central meteorological observatory by telegram. Each meteorological observatory uses various specific symbols and numbers to fill these observation records on a map, and a weather map can be made. From the weather map, you can see the temperature of various places, the direction and speed of the wind, the distribution of clouds, the area of rain and snow, and so on. In this way, each meteorological observatory can predict the future weather evolution by comparing the various weather maps of the previous day or two and the local weather conditions. Therefore, the meteorological observatory can often tell people more accurate weather conditions. For example, the powerful typhoon that landed in Xiangshan, Zhejiang in early August 1956, due to the relatively accurate forecasts and warnings issued by the relevant meteorological observatories in advance, enabled various places to make timely prevention and rescue work, reducing the loss of people's lives and property.
    Sometimes the weather forecast is inaccurate because:
    First, there are not enough meteorological observatories and stations, and the distribution is uneven, especially the distribution of high-altitude stations is far from meeting the needs. A certain weather condition has a certain range, such as the range of thunderstorms, its diameter is as small as within 20 kilometers, but sometimes it can be intermittently distributed in a zone of more than 1,000 kilometers. Due to the small number of measuring stations, omissions often occur and are not detected in time.
    Second, the atmospheric evolution process is much more complicated than the changes of other substances, and meteorology itself is still a young science. The scale of atmospheric change is very large, and there are many factors that dominate the change (such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, etc.). Until now, many meteorological theoretical problems have not been properly resolved. In practice, meteorology has only become an independent research science in recent decades. Especially my country's meteorological undertakings have only developed after the founding of New China. Therefore, there is still insufficient accumulation of experience, and many of the inherent laws of meteorology have not been fully grasped by meteorological workers; there are also insufficient instrument and equipment. At present, we can only make forecasts of weather trends, and the forecasting methods are not perfect, so the forecasting results are difficult to achieve absolute accuracy. Now the accuracy rate of weather forecasts in the Soviet Union has reached 80%-90%. The accuracy rate of disaster weather forecasts in my country can reach 80%-85%, and the accuracy rate of general short-term weather forecasts is only 70%-80%. We are working hard to reach the international level.

　　明天的天气怎样？
　　——谈气象台的天气预报
　　龚仲春
    明天会不会刮风、下雪？这是大家日常所关心的事情。有些对天气有经验的人，会抬头看看天，看是什么云、什么风？来判断明天的天气。凭经验看天空，虽然也能知道短时间内的天气变化，毕竟不大准确。比较可靠的还是气象台的天气预报。
    天气的变化主要就是因为空气流动所造成。随着大气的运行，一个地区所发生的天气现象往往可以影响到几百公里甚至几千公里以外的地区。比如，如果今天内蒙古地区在大雪纷飞，很可能明天这些下雪的云层随着气流来到华北，使北京地区也下起雪来；如果今天苏联贝加尔湖地区上空有冷气流，很可能过一两天我国东北地区会发生寒潮。
    但是，天气变化不是神秘莫测的。
    在世界许多地方，无论是繁华的市镇和荒僻的边疆，还是燥热的沙漠和绿草成茵的草原，或是终年积雪的高原或低于海平面的盆地，以及经常云雾弥漫的山顶或波涛万顷的海洋，都分布着气象台、站，在那里有成千上万的气象工作人员，按着一定的规程和时间间隔，日日夜夜地对天气变化情况进行观察。他们除用肉眼观察云、雨、雪……外，还利用仪器观测地面和高空的各种气象情况。各个站得到观测记录后，就用电报拍发到当地气象台或中央气象台。各气象台便用各种特定的符号和数字，把这些观测记录填到一张地图上，就可以制出一张天气图。从天气图上，可以看出各地气温的高低，风的方向和速度，云层的分布，雨雪的地区等等。这样，各气象台对照前一两天的各色各样的天气图和当地的天气情况，就可以预测出未来天气演变的情况了。所以气象台能经常把比较准确的天气情况告诉人们。例如，1956年8月初在浙江象山登陆的强大台风，由于各有关气象台事先发布了比较准确的预报和警报，使各地及时地作了预防和抢救工作，减少了人民生命财产的损失。
    有时候天气预报不准确，是因为：
    第一，目前气象台、站还不够多，分布也不均，尤其是高空台、站的分布还远远不能满足需要。一定的天气状况有一定的范围，比如雷雨的范围，它的直径最小到二十公里以内，但有时候它又可以断续的分布在长达千余公里以上的地带中。由于测站少，往往就有遗漏，未能及时发现。
    第二，大气演变过程比其他物质的变化过程要复杂得多，而气象科学本身还是一门年青的科学。大气变化的规模很大，支配变化的因素很多（像温度、气压、湿度、风向、风速等），直到现在，还有许多气象理论上的问题，没有获得适当的解决。在实践方面，气象成为一门独立研究的科学还是近几十年的事。特别是我国的气象事业，新中国成立后，才得到发展。因此在经验积累上还很不足，有许多气象本身的规律性尚没有完全被气象工作者所掌握；仪器设备方面也还不足。目前，我们还只能做到天气趋势的预报，预报方法还不是完美无缺的，因而预报结果也难以达到绝对准确。现在苏联天气预报的准确率已经达80％—90％。而我国灾害性天气预报的准确率可以达80％—85％，一般短期天气预报的准确率不过达到70％—80％。我们正在为着达到国际水平而努力。
