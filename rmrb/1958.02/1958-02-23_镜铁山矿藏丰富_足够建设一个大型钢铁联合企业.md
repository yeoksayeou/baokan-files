    Jingtieshan's Rich Mineral Deposits
    Sufficient for Building a Large Iron and Steel Complex
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 22nd: Resource exploration work near Jingtieshan in the Gansu area has concluded, confirming that the iron ore deposits buried here are sufficient for building a large-scale iron and steel complex.
    This mining area is the most important mining area of the Jingtieshan Iron Mine. After more than a year of exploration, it has been determined that the reserves here are more than what the national plan requires, and the iron content of the ore also meets the requirements of industrial production. Approximately two-thirds of the entire reserves have an iron content grade of around 40%. Auxiliary materials necessary for smelting iron and steel, such as limestone, dolomite, and quartzite, have also been found in sufficient quantities around the iron ore.
    Jingtieshan belongs to the Qilian Mountains and is located southwest of Jiuquan City in Gansu Province. In 1955, with the help of local herdsmen, geological explorers found a large area of ​​shiny specular hematite outcrops in this area, so the geologists called it "Jingtieshan" (Mirror Iron Mountain).

    镜铁山矿藏丰富
    足够建设一个大型钢铁联合企业
    新华社兰州22日电　甘肃地区镜铁山附近一个矿区资源勘探工作已经结束，证实这里埋藏的铁矿石足够用来建设一个大型钢铁联合企业。
    这个矿区是镜铁山大铁矿最主要的矿区。经过一年多勘探，确定这里的储量比国家计划要求的还要多，矿石含铁量也合乎工业生产要求，其中含铁品位在40％左右的约占整个储量的三分之二。冶炼钢铁必需的石灰石、白云石、石英岩等辅助原料，也在铁矿外围找到了足够的产地。
    镜铁山属于祁连山系，在甘肃省酒泉市的西南面。1955年，地质勘探人员在当地牧民的帮助下，在这一带找到了大片乌亮的镜铁矿石露头，因此地质人员管它叫做“镜铁山”。
