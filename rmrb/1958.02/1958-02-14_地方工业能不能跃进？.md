    Can Local Industry Leap Forward?
    Can local industry leap forward? This is a matter of ideology that local industrial cadres in Liaoning Province need to resolve when formulating production plans. Many enterprise leaders overemphasize difficulties, saying things like "potential has been exhausted" and "equipment is old," and cannot propose a plan that meets the requirements of a leap forward. On the 10th, the Liaoning Daily published on its front page a headline about the total output value of local industry in Benxi City increasing from 94 million yuan last year to 200 million yuan, indicating that a major debate between advanced and conservative thinking was conducted during the formulation of this leap forward target. The target was broken through eight times, increasing from the original 15% growth to 70% growth. Based on this fact, the Liaoning Daily commentator published a commentary, pointing out that local industry can leap forward.

    地方工业能不能跃进？
    地方工业能不能跃进？这是辽宁省地方工业干部在制订生产计划中要解决的一个思想问题。有不少企业的领导者过分强调困难，说什么“潜力挖光了”“设备老旧”，提不出一个符合跃进要求的计划。10日辽宁日报一版头条刊登了本溪市地方工业总产值将要由去年的九千四百万元增加到两亿元的消息，说明这个跃进指标制订过程中曾开展了一场先进与保守思想的大辩论，指标八次被突破，由原来增长15％提高到增长70％。辽宁日报评论员根据这一事实，发表了评论，指出地方工业是能跃进的。
