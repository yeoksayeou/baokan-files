(Special dispatch from Xin Hua News Agency) Henan Province has decided to use rabbit-adapted attenuated hog cholera vaccine to inoculate 19 million pigs this year, basically eliminating hog cholera. It will also establish 23 hog disease-free counties, 268 hog disease-free townships, and 1,728 hog disease-free communes, creating experience for the complete elimination of various pig diseases in the next two to three years.

In the past, tens of thousands of pigs in Henan Province died annually from diseases such as hog cholera, swine fever, and swine erysipelas, causing serious losses to pig production. In response to this situation, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Service Department recently jointly summarized past pig disease prevention and control work, identified experiences and lessons, and, in accordance with the spirit of spending less money and doing more, formulated specific measures for preventing and controlling hog cholera this year using rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine. It requires that agricultural departments in each special zone and county, in addition to assigning two to three technicians to set up small-scale vaccine factories to manufacture vaccines, immediately organize approximately 100,000 local livestock conservation cadres and folk veterinarians for short-term training on a rotating basis. They will then go to the countryside to contract out areas, assisting the province's more than 56,000 agricultural communes to train two epidemic prevention workers per commune to learn vaccine manufacturing and vaccination techniques, achieving commune-by-commune epidemic prevention and pig-by-pig injection, preventing the occurrence and spread of hog cholera.

Henan Province began trial production of rabbit-adapted attenuated hog cholera vaccine last spring. According to inspections and appraisals in 36 counties (cities), the immunization rate of pigs inoculated with this vaccine is almost 100%.

    社社防疫　猪猪注射
    河南今年将基本消灭猪瘟
    本报特约新华社专讯　河南省决定今年用猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗预防注射一千九百万头生猪，基本上消灭猪瘟，并将建立起二十三个无猪病县、二百六十八个无猪病乡、一千七百二十八个无猪病社，为今后二、三年内彻底消灭生猪的各种疫病创造经验。
    河南省过去每年死于猪瘟、猪肺疫、猪丹毒等病疫的生猪总有几十万头，使养猪生产受到严重损失。针对这种情况，河南省农业厅、服务厅最近共同总结了过去的病猪防治工作，找出经验教训，并且根据少花钱多办事的精神，制定今年利用兔化弱毒疫苗等防治猪瘟的具体措施，要求各专区、县的农业部门除抽出二至三个技术员办起小型疫苗厂制造疫苗以外，并立即把各地大约十万名家畜保育干部和民间兽医等组织起来，轮流进行短期训练，然后去农村分片包干，帮助全省五万六千多个农业社每社培训两个防疫员，学会制造疫苗和防疫注射技术。作到社社防疫、猪猪注射，制止猪瘟发生和流行。
    河南省在去年春天开始试制猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗，根据三十六个县（市）检查鉴定，利用这种疫苗注射过的猪，免疫率几乎达到100％。
