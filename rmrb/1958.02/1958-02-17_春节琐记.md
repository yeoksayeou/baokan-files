    Random Notes on the Spring Festival
    Zuo Huan
    Today is Lunar New Year's Eve. According to old customs, the household chores today are the most trivial and the liveliest during the Spring Festival. It signifies bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, and it is the beginning of another year. People hope for a bright future and peace for the family, so they inevitably offer some prayers for blessings. There are many customs related to New Year's Eve, and they vary from place to place. Now, let's briefly discuss the general customs:
    Around the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month, near the Spring Festival, every household cleans the house, dusts away the cobwebs, and washes bedding, signifying renewal and getting rid of the old. After cleaning the house, spring couplets are pasted on the door frames. Originally, peach wood boards with inscriptions were hung on the doors, said to ward off evil spirits and misfortune. Later, this gradually changed to pasting spring couplets.
    Since ancient times, people have often drunk Tusu wine during the Spring Festival. A Song Dynasty poem says: "Only use poverty and sorrow to gamble for long-term health, not hesitating to be the last to get drunk on Tusu." Drinking wine infused with Tusu herbs is believed to be good for health.
    On New Year's Eve, every household keeps lamps and candles burning all night, representing brightness and symbolizing a year of plenty. Some families beat the rice storage bins and welcome the New Year's meal at night, drawing many circles on the ground with white powder, each circle representing a storage bin of grain. A pot of rice is cooked, sprinkled with dates and chestnuts, and eaten after New Year's Day to show that there will be rice to eat every year.
    The New Year's Eve reunion dinner always includes a bowl of carp and tofu, taking the homophones for "abundance" and "wealth." Carp leaping over the Dragon Gate also signifies "nobility." Silly children often stay up all night. There is a saying: "Staying up for the winter father makes him live a long life, staying up on New Year's Eve makes mother live a long life." Some people also use scallions to hit children's heads at the fifth watch (around 3-5 am), said to add intelligence.
    In various places, besides greeting each other with "Happy New Year" on New Year's Day morning, the first thing people eat also differs. Some eat cake first (homophone for "high"), some eat dates first (homophone for "early"), some drink almond tea first (homophone for "luck"); some eat persimmons first ("everything goes as you wish"), some eat a Five-Spice Dish (including scallions, garlic, chives, artemisia, and mustard, tender spicy vegetables eaten together, representing welcoming the new), and some eat Yuanxiao (sweet rice dumplings, symbolizing reunion).
    In the old society, the Spring Festival brought different feelings to people of different classes, with sweetness and bitterness. The rich families with wine and meat were joyful, while the poor families were worried. Those who were exploited relied on debt and pawning to survive on ordinary days, and during the Spring Festival, creditors pressed for debt even more urgently. No wonder the poor called the Spring Festival "the year-end hurdle." There is a saying in the North: "The Laba porridge that delivers the message, the Guan Dong candy that takes your life (a common name for maltose candy), the dumplings that save your life." When Laba arrives, the calendar secretly tells people that the Spring Festival is approaching. After the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month, after the Kitchen God is offered sacrifice, creditors begin to collect debts. Coming to collect once or twice, coming to collect every day, forcing the debtor to the point of having no way out, even throwing themselves into the river or well, and the family is scattered. From the 23rd to New Year's Eve, the poor families are truly like being fried in oil, and New Year's Eve is even harder to bear. The debt collector wearing a fur coat, holding a red lantern, stubbornly sits in the debtor's house, refusing to leave until the money is received. What do the poor have to repay? That is truly "life-threatening"! But debt collectors customarily stop collecting after midnight on New Year's Eve.
    Because most people in the North eat dumplings on New Year's Day morning, dumplings have become "life-saving."

    春节琐记
    左宦
    今天是阴历除夕，按旧俗，春节中以今天的家务事情最琐碎，也最热闹。它表示除旧迎新，又是一年的开端，人们都希望未来的日子美好，人口平安，不免要作些祝福的祈祷。关于除夕的风俗很多，各地也不相同，现在大略谈谈一般的习俗：
    蜡月二十四交年节前后，家家户户要扫房掸尘，拆洗被褥，取更新除旧的意思。扫房之后，就要在门楣上贴春联。最早是用桃板刻符，挂在门上，据说可以避邪，除不祥，后来逐渐改变，成为贴春联了。
    古来春节多饮屠苏酒，宋人诗：“但把穷愁博长健，不辞最后醉屠苏”。用屠苏药草泡酒喝，取其能健身。
    除夕夜家家灯烛通宵，表示光明灿烂、象征来年丰衣足食。有的人家在夜间要打稻囤，接年饭，即在地上用白粉作许多圈圈，一个圈代表一囤粮食。煮熟一锅饭，在上面洒上枣栗等物，过了元旦再吃这锅饭，以示年年有饭吃。
    除夕团圆饭，总要摆上一碗鲤鱼和豆腐，是取“余”，“富”的谐音。鲤鱼跳龙门，又有“贵”的意思。痴儿騃女多守岁不睡。俗语：“守冬爷长命，守岁娘长命”。还有在五更时用葱打小孩头，据说是添聪明。
    各地元旦早上除了见面道声“新禧”外，第一口先吃的东西也不一样，有先吃糕的（谐高），有先吃枣的（谐早），有先吃杏仁茶的（谐幸）；有先吃柿子的（事事如意），有吃五辛盘的（即葱，蒜、韭、蒿、芥，辛嫩之菜，杂和食之，表示迎新），有吃元宵的（取意团圆）。
    在旧社会，春节带给不同阶级的人的感觉，也有甜苦之分。朱门酒肉之家是兴高采烈，贫寒人家却愁眉难展。那被剥削的人们，平日就倚借债典当渡日，到了春节，债主要债逼的更紧。无怪贫寒人要称春节是“年关”了。北方有这样一句话——送信的腊八粥，要命的关东糖（麦芽糖的俗称），救命的饺子。到了腊八，日历暗中告诉人快到春节了，腊月二十三祭灶后，便是债主开始讨债的日子了。一次二次的来讨，天天的来讨，把借债人逼得走头无路，甚至投河觅井，家人分散。从二十三到除夕这七天中，贫寒之家真如受油熬煎，到了除夕更是难熬。那来讨债的腿子穿上皮袄，手持红灯笼，赖坐借债人家中，非要到钱不肯走开。穷人拿什么去还？那真是“要命”！但讨债人在习惯上是过了除夕午夜就不讨了。
    因为元旦早上北方大多吃饺子，所以饺子就成了“救命”的了。
