Xinhua News Agency, 5th - The First National Congress of the Chinese Agricultural Water Conservancy Trade Union, lasting eight days, concluded on the 5th.

The conference passed a resolution requiring trade union organizations at all levels of agricultural water conservancy to earnestly and vigorously launch socialist competitions, widely igniting a mass upsurge of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced, so that advanced units become even more advanced, and backward units can rapidly rise to the advanced level, in order to achieve common leap forward and promote an all-around surge in agricultural water conservancy construction.

The resolution also pointed out that the national state-owned agricultural and water conservancy systems must continue to carry out rectification campaigns under the leadership of the Party, further enhance the socialist consciousness of the masses, and cultivate agricultural water conservancy workers into a large army of production with consciousness, organization, and discipline. At the same time, they must more actively implement the policy of diligence and thrift and "more, faster, better, and more economical," eliminate all waste, and deeply tap production potential, so that state-owned farms become model enterprises with high output, low costs, and large profits.

The resolution stated that responsible cadres of agricultural water conservancy trade union organizations at all levels should also pay special attention to going deep into production, going deep into the grassroots, and going deep into the masses, and participate in running "experimental plots" to obtain practical production knowledge and transform themselves from laymen into experts in order to better lead the great leap forward in production and adapt to the needs of the development of mass movements.

During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De attended and addressed all the delegates. He called on employees of the national agricultural water conservancy system to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, rapidly develop state-owned agriculture, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, and complete the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan. He pointed out that state-owned farms, animal husbandry farms, and tractor stations, as advanced forms of socialist agriculture, have great prospects for development. He said that in order to develop state-owned farms and animal husbandry farms, it is necessary to practice strict economy. Employee dormitories, cattle sheds, and horse pens should be simple and crude, and the differences in working hours, wages, and welfare should not be too far from those of local farmers. We should maximize the role of labor and strive to increase the income of farms and animal husbandry farms.

During the conference, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Zhen, Minister of Land Reclamation, Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, and Li Baohua, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy, all attended and delivered speeches.

At this conference, seventy-six representatives reported on their experiences in the work of trade unions in state-owned farms and animal husbandry farms and in running farms diligently and thriftily (including written speeches); representatives from another two hundred and thirty-five farms, animal husbandry farms, tractor stations, and water conservancy construction units put forward a competition initiative to the employees of the national state-owned agricultural water conservancy system, centered on realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production. This competition initiative received unanimous approval and support from all the representatives.

The conference elected He Yingcai and fifty-two others as members of the National Committee of the Chinese Agricultural Water Conservancy Trade Union, and An Zhenyi and ten others as alternate members.

　　农田水利工作者决心比先进带落后
    推动水利建设全面高涨
    新华社5日讯　历时八天的中国农业水利工会第一次全国代表大会已在5日结束。
    会议通过了决议，要求农业水利工会各级组织必须切实把社会主义竞赛蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来，广泛地掀起一个群众性的比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮，从而使先进的单位更加先进，落后的单位能够迅速提高到先进水平，以达到共同跃进，推动农业水利建设的全面高涨。
    决议并指出，全国国营农业和水利系统必须在党的领导下继续开展整风运动，进一步提高群众的社会主义觉悟，把农业水利工人培养成为有觉悟、有组织、有纪律的生产大军，同时要更积极地贯彻勤俭节约和“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针，消除一切浪费现象，深入挖掘生产潜力，使国营农场成为产量高、成本低、利润大的模范企业。
    决议说，农业水利工会各级组织的负责干部，还应当特别注意深入生产、深入基层和深入群众，并且参加搞“试验田”，以取得实际生产知识，使自己由外行变成内行，以便更好地来领导生产大跃进和适应群众运动发展的需要。
    在会议期间，朱德副主席到会向全体代表讲了话。他号召全国农业水利系统的职工贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，迅速发展国营农牧业和水利事业，完成第二个五年计划的任务。他指出，作为社会主义农业中的高级形式的国有制的农牧场和拖拉机站，是有伟大发展前途的。他说，为了发展国营农牧场，必须厉行节约。职工宿舍、牛棚马圈等应该因陋就简，在劳动时间、工资福利等方面也不要同当地农民相差过远。应该最大限度地发挥劳动力的作用，努力增加农牧场的收入。
    会议期间，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、农垦部长王震、农业部长廖鲁言和水利部副部长李葆华，都到会讲了话。
    在这次会议上，有七十六位代表分别在大会上报告（包括书面发言）了国营农牧场工会工作的经验和勤俭办场等方面的经验；还有二百三十五个农牧场、拖拉机站和水利建设等单位的代表，向全国的国营农业水利系统的职工，提出了以实现农业生产大跃进为中心内容的竞赛倡议，这个倡议竞赛得到了全体代表的一致赞同和支持。
