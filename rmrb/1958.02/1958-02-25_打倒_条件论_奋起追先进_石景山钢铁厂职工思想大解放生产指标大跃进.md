Xinhua News Agency, February 24th. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, in its anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, boldly faced its backwardness, bravely compared itself with the most advanced brother factories, and even stepped outside the metallurgical system to compare with the most advanced units in other industrial systems, achieving a great victory for the entire plant both economically and ideologically.

　　Looking at Ourselves Behind Closed Doors, We Felt We Were Not Bad
　　Opening the Door to Look, We Realized We Were Backward

In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, the factory's workers and masses exposed many conservative and backward phenomena in production. The masses criticized the "stable improvement" policy proposed by the factory last year as not clear enough, and that in its implementation, it only emphasized stability and neglected improvement. To change this conservative thinking and backward phenomena, the leadership was determined to eliminate bureaucracy, arrogance, and complacency, and proposed the slogan of "three comparisons" to all employees: compare products and speed with brother factories, and compare work enthusiasm with the peasant masses. They also announced a list of advanced production indicators from various factories in the national metallurgical system. The result of the comparison showed that in iron smelting: the blast furnace utilization coefficient was not as high as Anshan Iron and Steel; the coke ratio (coke used to smelt one ton of iron) and the air blast downtime (time for blast furnace shutdown for repairs) were not as low as Anshan Iron and Steel; in coking, the coal washing recovery rate (ratio of washed clean coal to raw coal) was not as high as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and the coke lump size (excellent large coke) was not as good as Shijiazhuang Coking Plant; in casting, the ingot mold finished product rate was not as high as Anshan Iron and Steel and Shanghai Steel Plant; in transportation and power, although some indicators were more advanced than brother factories, after jumping out of the metallurgical system and comparing with the advanced indicators of the railway transportation and power systems, it was found that the factory's locomotive overhaul cost was higher than that of the Mudanjiang and Tangshan locomotive repair plants, and the boiler coal consumption was not as low as that of the Shijingshan Power Plant.

This comparison revealed that more than 20 indicators were behind one or several other factories, which suddenly awakened all the factory's employees. Some employees said: "Looking at ourselves behind closed doors, we felt we were not bad, but opening the door to look, we realized we were backward." The broad masses of employees were filled with emotion and demanded to catch up. However, a few technicians and cadres expressed doubt about this comparison method. Some said: "Anshan Iron and Steel is a modern factory, and its raw material conditions are better than ours, so we cannot compare with it." Someone in the Transportation Department believed that "steel plants cannot be compared with railway departments, as railway departments have complete conditions," and so on.

　　Comparing with Advanced Should Not Emphasize the Same Conditions
　　As Long as it Can Promote Production, We Should Compare

Could such a comparison be made? Did they dare to make such a comparison? Under the leadership of the Party Committee, all the employees of the factory, after discussion, affirmed this question. Many people pointed out that the conditions of each factory and mine in the country are not completely the same, and if we emphasize completely the same conditions, we will cancel the competition. Some people said that regardless of whether it is the railway system or the metallurgical system, as long as it is beneficial to promoting our production upsurge, we can compare. An engineer in the Iron Smelting Department said that Anshan Iron and Steel does not have better conditions than our factory in everything. The equipment conditions of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace and our factory's blast furnace are the same, but it uses 70 kilograms less coke to smelt one ton of iron than our factory.

After solving this ideological understanding problem, the enthusiasm of the workers and masses to compare with the advanced became even higher, and many employees tried every means to tap potential, and new indicators continued to emerge. However, when discussing the Great Leap Forward indicators, some conservative thinking of lacking vigor and settling for less was also exposed. An individual engineer in the Iron Smelting Department said that he had confidence in catching up with Anshan Iron and Steel, but no confidence in surpassing Anshan Iron and Steel. His opinion was to let the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant only follow behind the advanced forever, and not run in front of the advanced. When the leaders of the steam workshop of the Power Department were setting coal consumption leap forward indicators, they only compared with some less advanced units, and did not compare with the most advanced units, only stopping the coal consumption indicators at a less advanced level (that is, using 116 kilograms of coal to burn one ton of steam), and did not raise it to the most advanced level (that is, using less coal than 116 kilograms to burn one ton of steam). The new coal consumption indicators were hastily determined without full discussion. The Party Committee promptly pointed out that this attitude was actually crawling thinking, not leap forward thinking.

　　The Working Masses are the Most Powerful Promotion Force
　　They are the Main Force for Sweeping Away Bureaucracy, Arrogance and Complacency

Based on this situation, the Party Committee further required that all indicators be taken to the worker masses for discussion. If the leaders of a unit could not come up with their own indicators, they would take out the advanced indicators of others and let the masses of their department discuss them themselves. Facts have proved that the working masses are not only direct producers, but also the most powerful promotion force. When the coking workshop discussed the coal washing recovery rate indicators, the foremen broke through the plans of the department, and the workers broke through the plans of the foremen. The new indicators leaped from more than 63% last year to more than 74% now. After the factory leaders handed over the target of producing 470,000 tons of pig iron this year to the masses for discussion, the workers immediately demanded a significant increase in this target. As a result of mass discussion, the pig iron production plan has risen to 480,000 tons, an increase of 11% over last year. Compared with the new indicators currently set by this factory and the indicators of other factories last year, about 10 items have reached the advanced level. For example, the factory's 0.39% blast furnace air blast downtime has exceeded Anshan Iron and Steel's level of 0.46%; the 74.41% coal washing recovery rate has exceeded Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's level of 72.6%; and the locomotive overhaul cost of 21,000 yuan has caught up with the Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Plant's level of 21,000 yuan.

This vigorous movement of comparing with the advanced not only led to a great leap forward in the factory's production indicators, but also powerfully eliminated the bureaucracy, arrogance, and complacency in the thinking and work style of cadres, technicians, and some workers, and enabled the broad masses of employees to take a big step forward ideologically. The broad masses of employees generally recognized the great political significance of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced. Many employees said that in the past, when the leaders criticized the indicators for being low, they attributed it to objective conditions, and when the leaders asked to raise the indicators, they asked for people, money, and equipment, but now they understand that these ideas are wrong. They said that the peasant masses can draw water up the mountains with simple iron picks, so as the working class, which is the leading class, what difficulties cannot be overcome?

Now, all the factory's employees are striving for the early realization of advanced indicators with a surging momentum. A wave of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced is also sweeping through the factory between furnaces, between shifts, and between individuals. The Iron Smelting Department has adopted the method of planting experimental plots. Two engineers have walked out of the office, each responsible for a blast furnace, to create new experiences in blast furnace utilization coefficients. In just over ten days, new records have been constantly emerging, and the daily output of the two main blast furnaces has reached the level of the new indicators. The coke fines rate (substandard coke fines) of one coke oven in the Coking Workshop has been reduced from 2.39% in the past to below 2%.

### 打倒“条件论”  奋起追先进  石景山钢铁厂职工思想大解放生产指标大跃进

    打倒“条件论”  奋起追先进
    石景山钢铁厂职工思想大解放生产指标大跃进
    新华社24日讯　石景山钢铁厂在反浪费反保守运动中，大胆正视自己的落后现象，勇敢地去比最先进的兄弟工厂，甚至跳出冶金系统，去比其他工业系统最先进的单位，使全厂在经济上和政治思想上打了一个大胜仗。
    关着门看，觉得自己还不错
    打开门一看，才知道自己落后了
    在反浪费反保守运动中，这个工厂的职工群众揭发了许多生产上的保守落后现象，群众批评厂里去年提出的“稳定提高”的方针不够明确，这个方针在推行中又只强调了稳定而忽视了提高。领导上为了改变这种保守思想和落后现象，决心打掉官气、骄气和暮气，向全体职工提出了和兄弟工厂比产品、比速度，同农民群众比干劲的三比口号，并公布了一批全国冶金系统各厂的先进生产指标。比的结果，证明这个厂在炼铁方面：高炉利用系数不如鞍钢的高，焦比（炼一吨铁所用的焦炭）、复风率（高炉停风进行修理的时间）等不如鞍钢的低；炼焦方面的洗煤回收率（洗过的净煤占原煤的比率）不如太原钢铁厂的高，焦炭块度（优良的大块焦炭）不如石家庄炼焦厂的好；铸造方面的钢锭模成品率也不如鞍钢和上海钢厂的高；在运输和动力方面，虽然有些指标比兄弟厂先进，但是在他们跳出了冶金系统这个圈子，去同铁路运输和电力系统的先进指标比较后，就发现工厂的机车大修成本高于牡丹江、唐山的机车修理厂，锅炉煤耗不如石景山发电厂的低。
    这样一比，发现有二十多项指标落在别的一个或者几个工厂的后边，使全厂职工顿时清醒过来。有的职工说：“关着门看，觉得自己还不错，打开门一看，才知道自己落后了。”广大职工情绪激昂，纷纷要求迎头赶上。但是也有少数技术人员和干部对这种比法，表示怀疑。有人说：“鞍钢是现代化的厂，原料条件比我们好，我们不能同它比。”运输部有人认为“钢铁厂不能和铁路部门比，铁路部门条件齐全”等等。
    比先进不应强调条件一样
    只要能促进生产就应该比
    能不能这样比？敢不敢这样比？这个厂的全体职工在党委会的领导下，经过辩论，肯定了这个问题。许多人都指出：全国各厂矿的条件都不完全一样，如果强调条件完全一样，就会取消比赛。有的人说：不管是铁路系统还是冶金系统，只要对促进我们的生产高潮有好处，就可以比。炼铁部一个工程师说，鞍钢也并不是什么条件都比本厂好，鞍钢一号高炉和本厂的高炉设备条件相同，但炼一吨铁就比本厂少用七十公斤焦炭。
    在解决了这个思想认识问题以后，职工群众比先进的情绪更加高涨起来，许多职工都千方百计挖掘潜力，新的指标不断出现。但是在讨论跃进指标时，也暴露出一些劲头不大、适可而止的保守思想。炼铁部的个别工程师说，他对追赶鞍钢有信心，对超过鞍钢没有信心，他的意见是让石景山钢铁厂只能永远跟在先进的后面追，而不能跑到先进的前面。动力部蒸气车间领导上在订煤耗跃进指标时，只比一些不太先进的，而不和最先进的比，只把煤耗指标停止在不太先进的水平上（即烧一吨蒸气用煤一百一十六公斤），而不把它提到最先进的水平（即烧一吨蒸气用比一百一十六公斤更少的煤），新的煤耗指标没有经过充分讨论，便草率确定下来。党委会及时指出这种态度实际上是爬行思想，而不是跃进思想。
    工人群众是最有力的促进派
    是扫除官气骄气暮气的主军力
    根据这一情况，党委会进一步要求所有指标都要拿到工人群众中去讨论，那个单位领导上拿不出自己的指标，就把别人的先进指标拿出来，让本部门的群众自己去讨论。事实证明：工人群众不仅是直接的生产者，而且也是最有力的促进派。焦化车间讨论洗煤回收率指标时，工段长们突破了部里的计划，工人群众又突破了工段长们的计划，新指标由去年的63％多跃进到现在的74％多。工厂的领导上把今年生产四十七万吨生铁的指标交给群众讨论后，工人群众立即要求大大提高这个指标，经过群众讨论的结果，生铁产量计划已经上升到四十八万吨，比去年增长11％。拿这个厂目前订的新指标和其他工厂去年的指标比较，已约有十项达到了先进水平。例如这个厂的0.39％的高炉复风率，已经超过鞍钢的0.46％的水平；74.41％的洗煤回收率，已经超过太原钢铁厂的72.6％的水平；机车大修成本两万一千元，已经赶上了牡丹江机车修理厂两万一千元的水平。
    这个轰轰烈烈的比先进的运动，不仅使工厂的生产指标来了一个大跃进，而且也有力地清除干部、技术人员和部分工人思想作风上的官气、骄气和暮气，使广大职工在政治思想上跃进了一大步。广大职工普遍认识到比先进、赶先进的重大政治意义。许多职工说：过去领导上批评指标低了，他们就归之于客观条件，领导上要求提高指标，他们就要人、要钱、要设备，现在明白这些思想是错误的。他们说：农民群众靠着简单的铁镐，就能引水上山，作为领导阶级的工人阶级，难道还有什么困难不能克服？
    现在，全厂职工正以一股汹涌澎湃的气势，争取先进指标的早日实现。厂内也掀起了炉与炉、班与班、个人与个人之间的比先进赶先进的热潮。炼铁部已经采取了种试验田的方法，两个工程师走出办公室，一个人负责一个高炉，创造高炉利用系数的新经验。短短十多天里，新纪录已经不断出现，两个主要高炉的日产量，已经达到了新指标的水平。焦化车间一焦炉的焦末率（不合格的焦炭碎末）已从过去的2.39％，降低到2％以下。
