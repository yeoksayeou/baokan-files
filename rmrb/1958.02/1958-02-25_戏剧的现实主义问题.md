	“The Problem of Realism in Drama”

	This collection of essays gathers twenty-two papers by the author, Zhang Guangnian, concerning dramatic creation and the problem of realism. Among them, "Realism in the Legacy of Traditional Opera," "Historical Materialism and the Problems of Historical Dramas and Mythological Dramas," and "Advancing Along the Path of Realism in Traditional Opera," criticize the anti-historical tendencies in the creation and adaptation of folk legends and historical subjects in traditional opera, and clarify that only a historical approach to the legacy of traditional opera and only a realistic method of creation are the correct paths. Essays such as "Striving to Create Typical Characters of Socialist New People on the Stage" and "Artistic Types and Social Essence" offer insightful discussions on how to correctly understand and create typical characters.

	When a revisionist wind began to blow through the literary and art circles at the end of 1956, the author wrote the article "Socialist Realism Exists and Develops," which sternly refuted revisionism and resolutely defended socialist realism. (Ping)

    “戏剧的现实主义问题”
    这部论文集收集作者张光年的二十二篇有关戏剧创作和现实主义问题的论文。其中“戏曲遗产中的现实主义”、“历史唯物论与历史剧、神话剧问题”、“沿着戏曲的现实主义轨道前进”等篇，对戏曲的民间传说与历史题材的创作和改编中的反历史主义倾向作了批判，并阐明只有历史主义地对待戏曲遗产，只有现实主义的创作方法，才是正确的道路。“为了在舞台上创造社会主义新人的典型性格而奋斗”、“艺术典型与社会本质”等篇，对如何正确地理解和创造典型性格，做了精辟的论述。
    当1956年末，文艺界开始刮起一股修正主义歪风时，作者写出的“社会主义现实主义存在着、发展着”一文，对修正主义予以严正的批驳，坚决保卫社会主义现实主义。　（平）
