　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo: Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, stated in the “Akahata” newspaper on the 3rd that the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party is preparing to convene a national representatives conference in February of this year to discuss the party's work guidelines for the Diet election campaign, as well as the party's work inside and outside the Diet.

　　He said that in the process of the election struggle, the ranks of the Communist Party will be further united, and the party's connection with the working masses will be strengthened.

　　Nosaka Sanzo pointed out that the Japanese public is increasingly demanding the dissolution of the Diet, but the current government is trying to avoid this. He said that the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, trade unions, and democratic organizations have already actively launched a struggle to strive for the dissolution of the Diet and the early holding of new elections.

　　Nosaka Sanzo pointed out that in order to establish a united front, the united action of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic organizations is of particularly great significance. He pointed out that the possibility of achieving such unity is increasing. He pointed out that at the local level, there are already examples of the establishment of a united front between socialists and communists. He said that efforts must be continued to unite the Communist Party and the Socialist Party and all domestic democratic forces on a nationwide scale.

    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社东京讯：日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三在3日的“赤旗报”上发表谈话说，日本共产党中央委员会准备在今年2月间召开全国代表会议，讨论党在国会竞选运动中的工作方针和党在国会内和国会外的工作的问题。
    他说，在竞选斗争的过程中，将进一步团结共产党的队伍和加强党同劳动群众的联系。
    野坂参三指出，日本公众越来越坚决地要求解散国会，但是目前的政府却想避开这件事。他说，现在共产党、社会党、工会和民主团体已经积极展开斗争，争取解散国会，早日举行新选举。
    野坂参三指出，为了建立统一战线，共产党、社会党以及其他民主组织的行动一致具有特别重大的意义。他指出，达成这种团结一致的可能性日益增长。他指出，在地方上，已经有了社会党人和共产党人之间建立统一战线的范例。他说，必须继续努力，在全国范围内把共产党和社会党和国内一切民主力量团结起来。
