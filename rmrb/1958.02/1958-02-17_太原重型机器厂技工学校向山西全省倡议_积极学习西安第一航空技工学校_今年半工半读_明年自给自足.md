This newspaper reports:

    The entire faculty, staff, and students of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Workers' Technical School, filled with revolutionary vigor, proposed to learn from Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School and issued a proposal to all brother workers' technical schools in Shanxi Province.

    Under the influence of the Party Central Committee's policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, running schools with diligence and thrift, and handling all undertakings with diligence and thrift, as well as the socialist school management methods of Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School, the school, after breaking down conservative thinking, tapping potential, and striving to increase production value sixfold to reach one million yuan, proposes to achieve half-work half-study this year and strive for self-sufficiency next year, so as not to ask the state for a single penny. The proposal is directed to all brother workers' technical schools in Shanxi Province. They demand the resolute implementation of the socialist teaching principle of combining theoretical teaching with practice, and combining internship, practice, operation, teaching, and product manufacturing, fundamentally overcoming the wasteful phenomenon of practicing for the sake of practicing. It is estimated that the school will create a total value of 800,000 to 1,000,000 yuan this year. It will achieve half-work half-study this year and self-sufficiency next year. During the half-work half-study period, the school will bear the students' medical expenses of 4,800 yuan, internship and experiment expenses of 68,640 yuan, and machine equipment maintenance and repair costs. The school will bear half of the people's scholarships, which amount to 69,600 yuan annually.

    Actively and systematically carry out socialist labor emulation campaigns, improve students' skilled operation skills, and increase labor productivity, so as to educate students to eliminate major accidents and equipment accidents, and strive to reduce minor accidents; at the same time, educate students on the collectivist spirit and communist moral qualities of unity, mutual assistance, and discipline. The indicators for the labor emulation campaign are: a quality pass rate of 96% for lathe workers, with a defect rate not exceeding 4%; a quality pass rate of 97% for milling workers, with a defect rate not exceeding 3%; a quality pass rate of 100% for fitter assembly, with a defect rate of parts processing not exceeding 2%; a product qualification rate of 85% for foundry workers, with a defect rate not exceeding 15% (calculated by weight); a product qualification rate of 96% for forging workers, with a defect rate not exceeding 4%; and an attendance rate of 98% or more.

    Strengthen teaching management, improve teaching quality, improve and strengthen the production internship management system, and resolutely do a diligent and thrifty job in running the school well, cultivating technical talents who are both expert and red.
