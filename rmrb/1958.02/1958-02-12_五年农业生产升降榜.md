    Five-Year Agricultural Production Rise and Fall Chart
    The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee adopted a comparison method to promote the great leap forward in agricultural production in various cities and counties. Recently, it made a chart of the rise and fall of the output of major agricultural products in various cities and counties in the province during the first five-year plan period and notified it to various places. This chart is called the "Five-Year Agricultural Production Rise and Fall Chart" and was published on the second page of the February 8th Shanxi Daily. From this chart, we can clearly see which counties have been increasing their output year by year in the past five years; which counties have been declining all the time; and which counties have increased their output in which year and decreased in which year.

    五年农业生产升降榜
    山西省人民委员会采用评比方法推动各市、县农业生产大跃进。最近将全省各市、县在第一个五年计划期间的主要农产品的产量升降情况，作了一个榜通报各地，这个榜叫做“五年农业生产升降榜”，刊在2月8日山西日报的二版上。从这个表上可以清楚地看到：五年来有哪些县的产量是年年上升的；有哪些县是一直下降的；哪些县的产量在哪年上升了，哪年又下降了。
