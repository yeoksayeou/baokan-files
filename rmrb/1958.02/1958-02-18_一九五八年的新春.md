    New Spring of 1958
    Xie Juezai
    I have spent seventy-five New Springs, but this year's New Spring is truly unparalleled.
    Human strength flourishes and surpasses the strength of heaven, and the east wind rises to suppress the west wind.
    The best time to plan for the year is early spring, and the united hearts of hundreds of millions of people can startle even stone.
    It is difficult for planning departments, revising and increasing the plan many times over.

    一九五八年的新春
    谢觉哉
    曾过七十五新春，今岁新春真绝伦。
    人力勃兴胜天力，东风飚起压西风。
    一年之计春来早，亿众齐心石亦惊。
    难煞机关作计者，几回修正几回增。
