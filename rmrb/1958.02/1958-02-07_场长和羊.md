　　The Farm Director and the Sheep
　　By our reporter Shen Shi

　　Once, Yang Wenxian, the director of the Gongnais Stud Farm, was in Urumqi attending a livestock industry conference. He shared a room with another comrade from a state-owned farm. During their casual conversation, that comrade sighed and said, "Sheep! How many more years will we be mixed up with them?"

　　Yang Wenxian, sensing his abnormal mood, asked, "Are you not very interested in working at a state-owned sheep farm?"

　　"I don't understand it, how can I get involved!"

　　Yang Wenxian comforted him, saying, "What's there to be afraid of! If you don't understand, delve into it, and you will slowly understand."

　　Yang Wenxian came to the stud farm in June 1954. Once, he asked a technician about the sheep herding situation. The person retorted, "Director! Do you understand sheep?" He knew this was sarcasm, but he did not back down. He had previously worked in the personnel department of the Livestock Bureau and had never been in contact with sheep. Coming here, he naturally faced difficulties in his work. When he recalled the hardships and obstacles encountered along the way from the Hubei-Henan-Anhui revolutionary base area to the Northwest during the Long March, and the suffering he endured when the warlord Sheng Shicai imprisoned him in Urumqi! However, the enemy's bayonets had not intimidated him, so how could he fail to manage a state-owned stud farm under his own government?

　　At that time, the stud farm did not have a complete set of regulations. Workers who had previously herded livestock for landlords were not yet treating the farm as their home. They brought their own sheep, taking extra care of their own sheep while being careless about the public's sheep during grazing. Veterinarians, using the excuse that "the sheep are sick and should be slaughtered," would feast on mutton. Yang Wenxian felt a pang of heartache seeing the Xinjiang sheep, which had been bred for so long, dying one after another.

　　At that time, the stud farm had no sheepfolds, no shearing sheds, no dipping pools... Workers lived in yurts and dugouts in winter. A few dilapidated houses by the Gongnais River served as both offices and dormitories for the staff. A consultant who came from inland stayed for a few days and said in disappointment, "Is this really the stud farm I imagined?" When Yang Wenxian heard this, he encouraged his comrades, saying, "Let him laugh! If he comes here again in a few years, he will change his opinion." Someone suggested building an office, but Yang Wenxian said, "If production hasn't improved, it's hard to feel at ease even sitting in the office!"

　　The stud farm's employees included members of seven ethnic groups. Yang Wenxian did not understand the languages of the minority ethnic groups, and there was no translator when he first arrived, which added another layer of difficulty to the work. At this time, the higher-ups appointed Maisifu Kaz as the deputy director of the stud farm. Maisifu Kaz came from a poor Kazakh herding family. After liberation, the Soviet expert Troitsky came to the stud farm to breed stud sheep, and Maisifu Kaz was his assistant. He was conscientious and responsible in his work and had a high reputation among the herders. Yang Wenxian talked to him about the steps and methods for rectifying the stud farm, and he expressed his full support.

　　In the early spring of 1955, Marabek's flock of sheep gave birth to 545 lambs, but 90 died. Yang Wenxian and Maisifu Kaz learned from the herders that Marabek only took care of his own 40-odd sheep when the ewes were giving birth, leaving the public's sheep to freeze in the wild. They found Marabek and explained in detail how much loss the death of 90 lambs had caused to the country, making him feel ashamed. However, when they persuaded him to have his father herd his own sheep for him, he was unwilling. He said, "If the sheep aren't around, what will my family live on?" Maisifu Kaz said, "You don't have to worry about life. In 1943, a bolt of cloth could only be exchanged for two sheep, but now one sheep can buy more than forty yards of cloth. The wages you earn are enough to support your whole family." Marabek finally agreed to have his father herd his own sheep.

　　More than thirty sheep in the flock of the herder Aidelihan were bitten or injured by wolves one night; it turned out that he had left the flock and gone back to his yurt to sleep. All the employees of the farm discussed this matter, and many people advocated dismissing him. Yang Wenxian believed that although Aidelihan was seriously derelict in his duties, the main reason for the death of the sheep was the lack of socialist education for the herders in the past and the absence of grazing regulations. He did not agree with everyone's opinion and instead assigned Aidelihan to herd cattle. One day, Aidelihan fell seriously ill, and Yang Wenxian sent someone to escort him to Yining for treatment. The herders throughout the farm were deeply moved. They said, "Who used to care about us when we got sick?"

　　While Yang Wenxian and Maisifu Kaz were conducting arduous and meticulous work among the herders, they also cleaned up the livestock and formulated grazing regulations and methods for handling private livestock and registering livestock deaths. After a year, the situation at the stud farm changed. Backward herders were transformed, Marabek became an advanced producer, and the livestock mortality rate decreased significantly. At the end of 1955, the stud farm turned over a profit of 214,000 yuan to the state.

　　Although the work of the stud farm began to get on the right track, the supply system mentality among the staff was still very strong. They said, "The farm doesn't have a seeder, please ask the higher-ups to allocate one to us!" So the seeder was allocated. They said, "We also need a mower." The mower was then piled up in the warehouse. Their idea was: regardless of whether these production tools are really needed, buy them first! Yang Wenxian thought that if they didn't prioritize, didn't calculate costs, and didn't use their brains, it would inevitably increase expenses and hinder the development of production. After the dipping pool was completed, Hasan, the head of the accounting section, told Yang Wenxian, "Managing the dipping pool requires twenty people." Yang Wenxian was very surprised to hear this and said to Hasan, "Calculate it and see if that many people are really needed?" After Hasan calculated, only eight people were needed. The whole farm then calculated the details again, and the number of management personnel at the farm headquarters, grazing workers, and temporary workers added during the lambing and shearing seasons was reduced. Because Yang Wenxian had a clear idea of running the farm diligently and frugally, the stud farm's profit turned over to the state increased to 387,000 yuan by 1956.

　　In the midst of the arduous work of rectifying the stud farm, Yang Wenxian tirelessly studied animal husbandry techniques. When he was with Maisifu Kaz, he would ask him if he didn't understand something. During the summer transfer to the pasture, he led a translator and went to graze in the Tianshan Mountains with the herders, and talked with the old herders, who shared many herding experiences. Over time, his knowledge of livestock breeding and management also became richer. In the past, the stud farm's forage reserves were arranged in the autumn. Yang Wenxian thought that storing already withered grass must have low nutritional value, so could the grass cutting time be moved forward? But he wasn't sure, and he couldn't get an answer from experienced herders either. He read books on the subject and confirmed that his idea was correct. After that, harvesting began when the forage bloomed and bore fruit. Once, Yang Wenxian went to inspect the sheep herd grazed by Kuannis and found the sheepfold to be very damp. He warned Kuannis that the sheep might catch diseases. Kuannis replied, "I've been grazing sheep for several years, and I've never seen sheep get sick from sleeping in a damp place." Yang Wenxian went to consult the old herder Abudu Alang, who said, "People get sick if they sleep in a damp place for too long, isn't it the same for sheep?" He talked to Kuannis again, and Kuannis finally cleaned the sheepfold. Not long after, disease broke out in his flock. Yang Wenxian quickly sent a veterinarian to treat them, preventing the spread of the disease. Kuannis later said to another herder, "We can't underestimate Director Yang anymore, he knows even more than us!"

　　场长和羊
　　本报记者　沈石
    一次，巩乃斯种羊场场长杨文先在乌鲁木齐参加畜牧业工作会议。和他同住一间房的也是一位从国营牧场来的同志，两人闲谈的时候，那位同志感叹地说：“羊！我们和它混到哪一年呢？”
    杨文先发觉他这种不正常的情绪，便问道：“你对国营羊场工作兴趣不大吗？”
    “我不懂，叫我怎好插手啊！”
    杨文先安慰他说：“怕什么！不懂，钻下去，慢慢会懂的。”
    杨文先在1954年6月来到种羊场。一次，他问一位技术员放羊的情形，这人反问他：“场长！你懂得羊吗？”他明明知道这是讽刺，却没有退缩。以前他在畜牧厅搞人事工作，从来没有接触过羊。到了这里，工作当中，自然免不了困难。当他回想起从鄂豫皖根据地经过长征到达西北的时候，沿途遇到多少艰难险阻，盛世才匪徒把他囚禁在乌鲁木齐的时候，又遭受多少苦难！然而，敌人的刺刀没有吓倒他，难道在自己的政权下，一座国营种羊场就不能管理好吗？
    那时候，种羊场还没有一套完善的制度，曾经给牧主放过牲畜的工人，还不是以场为家。他们带来了自己的羊，放牧的时候，对自己的羊倍加爱护，对公家的羊漫不经心。兽医借口“羊有病，应该宰杀”，便饱餐一顿羊肉。杨文先看到经过长期培育出来的新疆羊一批一批地死去，真是心如刀割。
    那时候，种羊场没有羊舍，没有剪毛房，没有药浴池……工人冬天住蒙古包和地窝子，巩乃斯河边十几间破烂的房屋，便是工作人员的办公室兼宿舍。有一位从关内来的顾问呆了几天，失望地说：“这难道是我想像的种羊场吗？”这句话被杨文先知道了，他鼓励同志们说：“任他嘲笑吧！若干年后，他如果再来这里，会改变看法的。”有人向他建议盖一个办公室，杨文先说：“生产还没有搞好，坐在办公室里，心也很难安哩！”
    种羊场的职工包括七个民族的成员。杨文先不懂少数民族语言，初来时也没有翻译员，工作多了一层困难。这时候，上级任命麦斯甫卡孜担任种羊场的副场长。麦斯甫卡孜出身于哈萨克族的贫苦牧民的家庭。解放后，苏联专家特罗依茨基来种羊场培育种羊，他是专家的助手，做事认真负责，在牧工当中有很高的威信。杨文先和他谈起整顿种羊场的步骤和办法，他表示全力支持。
    1955年春初，马拉别克的羊群生下五百四十五只羊羔，死了九十只。杨文先和麦斯甫卡孜向牧工们了解，才知道马拉别克在母羊产羔的时候，只照料自己的四十多只羊，让公家的羊放在野外受冻。他们找到马拉别克，同他算细账，使他明白死去九十只羊羔，给国家造成了多少损失。马拉别克感到很惭愧。可是，当劝说他把自己的羊交给他父亲代牧的时候，他又不愿意。他说：“羊不在场，我一家人的生活怎么办？”麦斯甫卡孜说：“你不用担忧生活，1943年，一匹布要换两只羊，现在一只羊可买四十多丈布，你挣的工资足够养活全家了。”马拉别克终于同意把自己的羊交给他父亲代牧。
    牧工艾德力汗的羊群，一个晚上被狼咬死咬伤三十多只；原来他离开了羊群回蒙古包睡觉去了。全场职工讨论这件事，许多人都主张开除他。杨文先认为艾德力汗虽然严重失职，但过去对牧工缺少社会主义教育，没有规定放牧的纪律，是羊只死亡的主要原因。他没有同意大家的意见，而改派艾德力汗去牧放牛群。一天，艾德力汗患了重病，杨文先派人护送他到伊宁治疗。全场的牧工深受感动，他们说：“从前我们生了病，有谁来过问呢？”
    杨文先和麦斯甫卡孜一方面在牧工当中进行艰苦细致的工作，一方面清理畜群，制定出放牧的纪律和处理私人牲畜、牲畜死亡登记等办法。经过一年，种羊场的情况便不同了，落后的牧工有了转变，马拉别克成了先进生产者，牲畜的死亡率显著地降低，1955年年终，种羊场给国家上缴了利润二十一万四千元。
    种羊场的工作虽然开始走上正轨，可是职员当中的供给制思想还很浓厚。他们说：“场内没有播种机，请示上级给我们调拨吧！”于是播种机调拨来了。他们说：“我们还需要割草机。”割草机又堆在库房里了。他们的想法是：不管是不是真正需要这些生产工具，先购置了再说！杨文先想，如果不分轻重缓急，不核算成本，不开动脑筋，必然增加开支，阻碍生产的发展。药浴池竣工以后，会计股长哈桑告诉杨文先：“管理药浴需要二十人。”杨文先听了非常惊奇，对哈桑说：“你算一算，是不是需要这么多人？”哈桑核算后，只要八个人就够了。全场又算了一次细账，场部管理人员、放牧的工人、接羔和剪毛季节增加的临时工都减少了。由于杨文先有明确的勤俭办场的思想，到1956年，种羊场给国家上缴的利润增加到三十八万七千元。
    杨文先在整顿种羊场的繁重工作当中，孜孜不倦地钻研牧畜技术。他和麦斯甫卡孜在一起的时候，不懂，便问麦斯甫卡孜。夏季转移草场，他领着翻译员，和牧工一道到天山丛中去放牧，找老牧工座谈，他们说出了许多放牧的经验。日子久了，牲畜饲养管理的知识也随着丰富起来。从前，种羊场储备牧草安排在秋天。杨文先想到，储存已经枯萎的草，草的营养价值一定低，能不能把割草的时间提前呢？可是他没有把握，问有经验的牧工，也得不到解答。他翻阅这方面的书籍，才证实了他想法的正确。以后，牧草开花结实的时候便开始收割。一次，杨文先去检查库安尼斯牧放的羊群，发现羊圈很潮湿。他警告库安尼斯，羊可能传染疾病。库安尼斯回答说：“我放了几年的羊，也没有见到羊睡在湿的地方就生起病来。”杨文先去请教老牧工阿布都阿朗，阿布都阿朗说：“人睡在潮湿的地方久了，也会生病的，羊还不是一样吗？”他又和库安尼斯谈，库安尼斯才把羊圈打扫干净。隔不多久，疾病在他的羊群发生了，杨文先赶紧派兽医去治疗，才防止了疾病的蔓延。库安尼斯后来对另外一位牧工说：“不能再小看杨场长了，他比我们懂得还多哩！”
