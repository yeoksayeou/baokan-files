    Two "Ifs"
    The United States is urging the Baghdad Pact member states to accelerate their arms race and war preparations. However, at the Ankara meeting, facing the clamoring needs of the member states, it only squeezed out a meager ten million US dollars as a "gift" to the Baghdad Pact countries. And this "gift" is still subject to "if the US Congress agrees to do so." This is more than a bucket of cold water poured on the heads of the member states who are eagerly awaiting large amounts of US dollars. The experience of Iran, one of the Baghdad Pact members, is an example. Iran's military expenditure amounts to 8 billion rials annually (100 rials equals 1.3 US dollars), which has resulted in a budget deficit of 10 billion rials for Iran this year. No wonder Iran's "Hafteh Khāverī" (Hafteh Khāverī Observation Weekly) complained: "If Iran had not joined the Baghdad Pact, its economic situation would not be like this." Obviously, even if Iran could get a share from Dulles' "gift" offered "if" it is given, the amount would be a drop in the bucket compared to its budget deficit.

    两个“假如”
    美国催促巴格达条约各成员国加紧扩军备战，可是，在安卡拉会议上，面对着嗷嗷待哺的各成员国，却只挤出一千万美元之数，作为给巴格达条约各国的“赠礼”。而这笔“赠礼”还有待于“假如美国国会同意这样做的话”。这样一来，对于眼巴巴盼望着大量美元的各成员国来讲，岂止是兜头一盆冷水。巴格达成员国之一伊朗的遭遇即是一例。伊朗支出的军费每年达八十亿里亚尔（一百里亚尔等于一点三美元），这就使得伊朗今年度的预算赤字竟达百亿里亚尔之巨。难怪伊朗的“哈弗特吉观察周刊”抱怨说：“假如伊朗不参加巴格达条约，那么它的经济情况就不会这样。”显而易见的，即使伊朗也能从杜勒斯“假如”给予的“赠礼”中，分得一份，所得之数，比起它的预算中的赤字来，真不过是杯水车薪。
