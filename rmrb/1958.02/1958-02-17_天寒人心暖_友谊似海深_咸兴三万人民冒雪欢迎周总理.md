Xinhua News Agency, Hamhung, February 16th: Premier Zhou Enlai, leading the Chinese government delegation, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nam Il, arrived here at eight o'clock this morning, as heavy snow fell from the sky. However, the grand and warm welcome from the people of Hamhung made the Chinese guests feel extraordinarily warm.

When Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Wentian, and General Su Yu stepped off the train with Premier Kim Il-sung, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nam Il, they were greeted by six thousand citizens of Hamhung waving flowers and colored flags, with a sea of cheers of "Long Live!" lasting for ten minutes. Here, the Chinese guests met with Li Weimin, Chairman of the People's Committee of South Hamgyong Province, and Hyun Moo-kwang, Chairman of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, among others.

Subsequently, the Chinese guests, accompanied by their hosts, traveled by car to visit the Hungnam Chemical Fertilizer Factory, a famous chemical industrial base in Korea, where they were warmly welcomed by more than 30,000 people. At the welcoming rally, after Factory Director Zhang Guang delivered a welcoming speech, Premier Zhou Enlai said, "The rapid recovery and continuous increase in production of the large-scale Hungnam Chemical Fertilizer Factory is an important support for the development of Korean agriculture."

Premier Zhou Enlai highly praised the workers here. He said, "The workers in the Hungnam area have a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, having fought against Japanese imperialist rule and against American imperialist aggression. After the armistice, you, with your selfless labor and high spirit of patriotism, quickly restored the severely damaged factory equipment and continuously increased the production of chemical fertilizers. In the past two years, the significant increase in agricultural production in Korea is inseparable from the contribution of your hard work."

Premier Zhou Enlai, facing the Soviet experts standing in front of the welcoming crowd, said, "The restoration and construction of your factory also benefited greatly from the assistance of our closest friends, the Soviet people. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Soviet experts who are helping to work here." At this time, Soviet experts and the welcoming masses applauded warmly.

When the Chinese guests visited the factory, workers lined the streets to welcome them wherever they went. Premier Zhou Enlai and others carefully visited every production workshop. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi also had brief conversations with many workers, inquiring about their production and living conditions.

The factory director, on behalf of all the workers, presented gifts to the Chinese government delegation.

During the visit, the factory负责人 told the Chinese guests that the Hungnam Chemical Fertilizer Factory was built in 1929 with investment from Japanese zaibatsu and put into production in 1940. The factory area covers 2 million square meters, with a building area of 700,000 square meters. The main products are divided into three categories: chemical fertilizers, aluminum, and grease, with a total of forty-five large and small workshops. After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the workers dispersed some important equipment, and five thousand workers went to the battlefield, while other workers opened underground factories and persisted in production. American imperialism carried out barbaric destruction of this factory. On August 1, 1950 alone, American planes dropped 1,200 large bombs on the factory, turning it into a wasteland. However, in less than two years after the war, all the factory employees gradually rebuilt the factory from the ruins, and with the help of the Soviet Union, began to build a modern ammonium nitrate fertilizer workshop with an annual output of more than 136,000 tons. The factory overfulfilled the three-year production plan in two years and four months, supplying 160,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer for agriculture.

Premier Zhou Enlai and others stayed in the factory for about two hours. When the delegation left, the streets were crowded with people, and more people gathered on both sides of the road, cheering and waving goodbye.

When the Chinese guests returned to Hamhung Station, the crowd that had welcomed them was still waiting there, and hundreds more young men and women had joined them. They were dressed in beautiful national costumes and performed graceful Korean national dances to the music and cheers. Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Kim Il-sung stood side by side and enjoyed the dance performance.

Before leaving the station, the负责人 of the People's Committee of South Hamgyong Province and the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the Korean Workers' Party presented gifts to Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the people here. Premier Zhou Enlai also accepted a basket of rice and a basket of apples from Han Biyun, a 61-year-old member of the Xinsan Agricultural Cooperative in Dongcheon-ri, Sinpo County, and Park Bok-soon, a 41-year-old female member of the Gwangheung-ri Agricultural Cooperative. After hearing the news that the Chinese delegation was coming, they took a train specifically to come. Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his deep gratitude for their kindness.

At 10:30 a.m., the guests and hosts boarded the train and left Hamhung amidst cheers, heading towards the heroic city of Wonsan. (Photos attached)

    天寒人心暖　友谊似海深
    咸兴三万人民冒雪欢迎周总理
    据新华社咸兴16日电　周恩来总理率领的中国政府代表团由金日成首相和南日副首相兼外务相陪同，在今天清晨八点钟到达这里，当时天空正飘着鹅毛大雪。但是咸兴人民盛大而热烈的欢迎使中国客人感到分外的温暖。
    周恩来总理、陈毅副总理兼外交部长、张闻天副部长、粟裕大将同金日成首相、南日副首相兼外务相等走下火车的时候，迎着他们的是咸兴市六千市民挥舞着鲜花和彩旗，海涛一般的欢呼“万岁”声持续了十分钟之久。在这里，中国客人会见了咸镜南道人民委员会委员长李维民，朝鲜劳动党咸镜南道委员会委员长玄武光等人。
    随后，中国客人由主人陪同，乘车前往朝鲜著名的化学工业基地——兴南化学肥料工厂参观，受到三万多人热情澎湃地欢迎。在欢迎会上，厂长张光致欢迎词后，周恩来总理说：“规模宏大的兴南化学肥料厂的迅速恢复和不断提高生产，对于朝鲜农业的发展是一个重要的支援。”
    周恩来总理极为称赞这里的工人们。他说：“兴南地区的工人同志们，有着光荣的革命斗争传统，曾经先后为反对日本帝国主义统治和反对美帝国主义的侵略而斗争。停战以后，你们又以忘我劳动和高度的爱国主义精神，迅速恢复了遭受严重破坏的工厂设备，不断地提高了化学肥料的产量。近两年来，朝鲜农业的显著增产，是同你们的辛勤劳动的贡献分不开的。”
    周恩来总理面对着站在欢迎群众面前的苏联专家说：“在你们工厂的恢复建设中，也有着我们最亲密的朋友——苏联人民的大力援助。我们借此机会向在这里帮助工作的苏联专家们致意。”这时苏联专家和欢迎群众一起热烈鼓掌。
    中国客人参观这个工厂时，所到之处都有工人夹道欢迎。周恩来总理等走到每一个生产车间仔细参观。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理还同许多工人进行了简短的谈话，询问他们的生产和生活情况。
    这个工厂的厂长代表全体工人向中国政府代表团送了礼物。
    在参观的时候，工厂的负责人告诉中国客人，兴南化学肥料工厂是在1929年由日本财阀投资兴建的，在1940年投入生产。厂地面积二百万平方公尺，建筑面积七十万平方公尺。主要产品分为化学肥料、铝、油脂三类，共有大小车间四十五个。在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，工人们把部分重要设备进行了疏散，有五千名工人走上战场，其他工人开设了地下工厂，坚持生产。美帝国主义对这个工厂进行了野蛮破坏，仅在1950年8月1日这一天，美国飞机就在这个工厂投掷了大型炸弹一千二百枚，将工厂夷为一片平地。但是，全厂职工在战后不到两年的时间，就把这个工厂逐渐从废墟中重建了起来，并且在苏联的帮助下，开始新建年产量达十三万六千多吨的现代化的氮铵肥料车间。这个工厂用两年零四个月的时间，就超额完成了三年的生产计划，为农业供给了十六万吨硫铵肥料。
    周恩来总理等在这个工厂里逗留了约两个小时。当代表团离开的时候，沿路人山人海，更多的群众聚集在道路两旁欢呼送别。
    中国客人回到咸兴车站时，原来在那里欢迎的群众依然等候在那里，而且又增加了几百名男女青年。他们穿着漂亮的民族服装，在乐曲和欢呼声中表演优美的朝鲜民族舞蹈。周恩来总理和金日成首相等并肩站在一起欣赏了舞蹈表演。
    在离开车站以前，咸镜南道人民委员会和朝鲜劳动党咸镜南道委员会负责人代表这里的人民向周恩来总理献礼。周恩来总理还接受了新方郡东川里新山农业社六十一岁的社员韩必运老大爷和光兴里农业社四十一岁的妇女社员朴福顺的一篮大米和一篮苹果。他们是在知道了中国代表团要来的消息以后，乘火车专程赶来的。周恩来总理对他们的盛意表示深深的感谢。
    上午十时半，宾主登上火车，在一片欢呼声中离开咸兴，向英雄的城市——元山前进。（附图片）
