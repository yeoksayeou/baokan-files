After being tempered by the fires of anti-waste and anti-conservatism,
    The capital's factories and mines are completely renewed in the rectification campaign.
    (Our newspaper reporter Ye Jianyun reports) Since Beijing deployed and launched the anti-waste campaign on January 14, sixty state-owned industrial enterprises and fourteen transportation units in the city have successively carried out special rectification against waste and conservatism. This campaign has sounded the alarm against the bureaucracy and conservative thinking of leading personnel, and has increased the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in cherishing state property, playing a role in promoting the current production upsurge.
    The scale and momentum of this special rectification campaign against waste and conservatism have exceeded the large-scale airing of views in the first stage of the rectification campaign. According to statistics from thirty-one enterprises over twenty days, workers posted a total of 200,000 big-character posters, putting forward 430,000 opinions. Of these opinions, some factories and mines have already processed more than 75%, and the least have processed 30%.
    The economic significance and political effect of Beijing's special rectification against waste and conservatism are very obvious. Broadly speaking, there are the following six aspects:
    First, it is of great benefit to improving leadership style and methods, eliminating official airs, stagnation, and arrogance, and clearing away conservative thinking. For example, the leaders of the First Automobile Accessories Factory had serious complacency and conservative thinking at the beginning of this year, believing that production was already "full" and no longer actively soliciting outside work to expand production. After the anti-waste campaign was launched, workers successively posted more than 500 big-character posters, focusing on exposing problems such as conservative production plans and backward labor quotas. Workers questioned the leaders in big-character posters, saying: The production plan is arranged loosely, the machines are not fully utilized, why not give the workers more work to do? An order from another factory for 100,000 cylinder head gaskets was not accepted by the leaders; workers criticized this practice in big-character posters, saying that it was "starving while looking at a pie." In terms of labor quotas, some work that could be completed in two hours was set at eight hours without modification. Workers said that this was a quota for the promoters of retreat. After mass exposure and criticism, the leaders of this factory immediately made a self-criticism and rearranged the production plan. The output value plan for this year has increased from the original 9 million yuan to 14 million yuan.
    Second, it has inspired the socialist enthusiasm of the masses. For example, the qualified product rate of the Electron Tube Factory last year was 85%. The leaders believed that this standard had reached the international level and that it was impossible to improve it further. Workers generally believed that there was little possibility of improvement. After the anti-waste campaign was launched, they calculated three accounts for processes, work sections, and workshops, and found that waste products alone would bring a loss of 1.4 million yuan to the country within a year. After debate, everyone agreed that the production of waste products was not entirely a matter of equipment and technical conditions, but more importantly, a lack of enthusiasm and a desire to save trouble. After unifying their understanding, workers launched a surge of enthusiasm to compete in drive. At present, their qualified product rate has reached 94%, and they have also put forward the goal of striving to reach 95%.
    Third, it has provided sufficient factual data to enable leaders to arrange the 1958 national plan in accordance with the spirit of promotion. The Zhangjiakou Locomotive Turning Section of the Beijing Railway Administration is a vivid example. Originally, the state assigned the section a locomotive washing and inspection time of sixteen hours; after looking at the actual situation last year, the leaders hardened their hearts and proposed shortening it to fifteen hours; some people disagreed, saying that it would be good to reach seventeen hours, and some grassroots cadres also opposed it, so the leadership retreated, saying, "We are planting watermelons in January, picking watermelons in February, and holding watermelons in March." (meaning: take it slow, don't rush). After the anti-waste campaign was launched in mid-January, workers exposed many key problems in production, and in the last ten days of January, the washing and repair time was shortened from 26 hours to 14 hours and 25 minutes, with the lowest taking only nine hours. After the fire of anti-waste burned away the leaders' infinite worries, this section has proposed to shorten the washing and repair cycle to eleven hours.
    Fourth, it has enabled technical personnel to further realize that they must go deep into reality and combine with the workers. In the past, many technical personnel believed that technical problems could not follow the mass line. When they encountered difficulties, they only went to look up books and find information. This time, the Changxindian Rolling Stock Factory put forward tens of thousands of opinions in the anti-waste airing of views. The technical opinions were researched and answered by the technical personnel. At the beginning, they studied and processed them in the office, processing only five or six a day. Later, they went to the workshop to discuss and process them with the workers, and they could process dozens a day. Many opinions that were considered difficult to handle in the past were also handled after discussion with the workers.
    Fifth, anti-waste and anti-conservatism is a lively and vivid socialist education course. Workers were very distressed to see the various wasteful phenomena that were exposed. They criticized the bureaucracy of the leadership and the purely technical views of the technical personnel, and also made deep self-criticisms. After criticism and self-criticism, socialist consciousness was generally improved, initiative and awareness were strengthened, and production enthusiasm was even higher. For example, Zhang Lian'en, an old worker at the Changxindian Rolling Stock Factory, and another worker cooperated during the anti-waste campaign to successfully develop a tool called a "muffler." Using this tool to forge castings can save the country more than 120 tons of metal materials a year. The design section of a factory needed to review hundreds of thousands of drawings within ten days; under normal circumstances, this task would take two months to complete, but driven by the anti-waste competition of the workers in the workshop, they completed it in eight days. Seeing the enthusiasm of the masses, the leaders of the factory happily said: The masses are mobilized, and this energy can really move mountains and fill the sea.
    Sixth, anti-waste and anti-conservatism also raised the issue of breaking with conventions. Many norms, regulations, rules, and standards have been followed for many years, but now it seems that doing so is wasteful. As the enthusiasm of the masses is further brought into play, the leadership is forced to break with conventions.
    Beijing's special airing of views against waste and conservatism is being carried out in the upsurge of rectification; this special airing of views has enriched the content of the rectification and brought the rectification work to a new stage. Many of the opinions aired by the workers show that the important reasons for waste phenomena are bureaucracy and subjectivism on the part of the leadership; and the lack of a high sense of responsibility for state property is an important reason on the part of the masses. The fundamental problem is ideological. Therefore, anti-waste must solve these ideological problems—establish the idea of building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and careful calculation, oppose bureaucracy, subjectivism, and conservative thinking, and oppose an attitude of not caring about state property. At present, Beijing's anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign is continuing to develop in depth along this direction.

    经过反浪费反保守的烈火千烧百炼
    首都厂矿在整风中万象更新
    本报讯　记者叶剑韵报道：北京市从1月14日布置开展反浪费运动以来，全市已经有六十个国营工业企业和十四个交通运输单位先后开展了反浪费反保守的专题整改。这次运动对领导人员的官僚主义和保守思想敲起了警钟，使广大职工提高了爱护国家资财的积极性；对当前的生产高潮起了促进的作用。
    这次反浪费反保守专题鸣放规模之大、来势之猛，超过了整风第一阶段的大鸣大放。据三十一个企业二十天的统计，职工们共贴出二十万张大字报，提出了四十三万条意见。对这些意见，部分厂矿已经处理了75％以上，最少的也已经处理了30％。
    北京市反浪费反保守专题整改的经济意义和政治效果十分明显。大体看来有如下六个方面：
    第一、对改进领导作风、领导方法，打掉官气、暮气、骄气，清除保守思想有很大好处。如第一汽车附件厂的领导人，今年年初自满情绪和保守思想相当严重，认为生产已经“吃饱了”，不再积极地揽外活扩大生产。反浪费开展以后，职工们接连贴了五百多张大字报，集中揭发了生产计划保守、工时定额落后等问题。工人们在大字报上责问领导说：生产计划排的松，机器吃不饱，为什么不多给工人活干？有十万件汽缸垫的外厂定货，领导人不接受；工人们贴大字报批评这种做法，说这是“看着馅饼挨饿”。在工时定额方面，有的两个小时可以干完的活，却定为八个小时，也不作修改。工人们说，这是促退派的定额。经过群众揭发批评，这个厂的领导人员立即作了检查，并且重新安排了生产计划。今年的产值计划，由原定的九百多万元，上升到一千四百万元。
    第二、激励了群众的社会主义干劲。如电子管厂去年的正品率是85％，领导人认为这个标准已经达到了国际水平，再提高是不可能的。职工们一般也认为提高的可能性不大。反浪费运动开展以后，他们算了工序、工段、车间的三笔账，仅废品一项，一年之内就要给国家带来一百四十万元的损失。经过辩论，大家一致认为，出废品不完全是设备和技术条件问题，重要的还是干劲不足，图省事怕麻烦。在统一了认识以后，职工们掀起了比干劲的热潮。目前，他们的正品率已经达到94％，还提出了达到95％的努力目标。
    第三、提供了充分的事实资料，使领导人有可能按照促进的精神安排1958年的国家计划。北京铁路管理局张家口机务折返段就是个鲜明的例子。原来国家交给这个段的机车洗检时间是十六个小时；领导人员看了看去年的实际情况，狠了狠心才提出缩短为十五个小时；有些人不同意，说能达到十七个小时就不错了，有些基层干部也反对，领导方面也就打了退堂鼓，说是“咱们是一月务西瓜，二月摘西瓜，三月抱西瓜。”（意思是：慢慢来，不着急）。1月中旬开展反浪费运动以后，职工们揭发了生产中的许多关键问题，下旬洗修时间就由二十六小时一下缩短到十四时二十五分，最低的只花了九个小时。在反浪费之火烧尽了领导人员的无限忧虑之后，这个段已经提出，要把洗修周期缩短到十一个小时。
    第四、使技术人员进一步认识到必须深入实际，和工人群众相结合。过去不少技术人员认为技术问题是不能走群众路线的，他们碰到了疑难，就只去翻书本找资料。这次长辛店车辆厂在反浪费鸣放中提出了一万几千条意见。其中有关技术方面的意见，由技术人员研究解答。开始的时候，他们在办公室里研究处理，一天只处理五、六条，后来下车间去和工人商量一道处理，一天就可以处理几十条。有许多意见，过去认为是很难办到的，经过和工人商量，也办到了。
    第五、反浪费反保守是一堂生动活泼的社会主义教育课程。职工们看到了揭发出来的各种浪费现象，很是痛心。他们一方面批评领导方面的官僚主义，批评技术人员的单纯技术观点，同时也作了深切的自我批评。经过批评与自我批评，社会主义觉悟普遍提高，主动性自觉性加强了，生产热情更加高涨。如长辛店车辆厂老工人张连恩和另一个工人合作，在反浪费运动期间研究成功了一种叫闷子的工具，用这种工具锻铸机件，一年内可以为国家节约一百二十多吨金属材料。某厂设计科，需要在十天之内审查完毕几十万张图纸；在一般的情况下，这批任务需要两个月才能完成，但在车间工人反浪费比干劲的热潮推动下，他们用了八天的时间就完成了。厂的领导人看到群众这股热情，高兴地说：群众动起来了，这股劲儿真可以拔山填海。
    第六、反浪费反保守还提出了打破陈规的问题。许多规范、章程、规则、标准，多少年来一直是照这样干的，现在看来，这样办就是浪费。由于群众的积极性进一步发挥了，就迫使领导方面不得不打破陈规。
    北京市的反浪费反保守专题鸣放，是在整改高潮中进行的；这个专题鸣放，又丰富了整改的内容，使整改工作进展到一个新的阶段。从职工鸣放出来的许多意见中可以看出：所以造成浪费现象，从领导方面检查，官僚主义和主观主义是重要原因；从群众方面检查，对国家财产缺乏高度责任心是个重要原因。根本问题是思想问题。因此，反浪费就要解决这些思想问题——树立勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、精打细算的思想，反对官僚主义、主观主义和保守思想，反对不关心国家财产的态度。目前，北京市的反浪费反保守运动正在沿着这个方向继续深入发展。
