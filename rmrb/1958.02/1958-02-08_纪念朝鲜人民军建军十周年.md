　　Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
　　Korean People's Army General Cui Xian
    The Korean people and all officers and men of the Korean People's Army are welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army in the midst of a vigorous struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the socialist construction of the northern half of the Republic.
    The Korean People's Army, the armed forces of the Korean people, has traversed a glorious combat journey under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic.
    Although the history of the Korean People's Army is not long, this short history radiates brilliant glory. During this historical period, the Korean People's Army, with its spirit of infinite loyalty to the motherland and the people, repelled the imperialist aggressors, gloriously defended the motherland, and established immortal feats of combat.
    Only after our country was liberated with the help of the great Soviet army did the Korean people enjoy true freedom and embark on the road of prospering the motherland and creating a new history. In the northern half of the Republic, under the leadership of the Party, a people's regime was established, various democratic reforms were implemented, and a revolutionary democratic base for the peaceful reunification of the motherland was created. However, in the southern half of our country, since the landing of the US imperialists, they have consistently pursued a colonial policy of enslaving the Korean people and have openly implemented a policy of aggression against the northern half of the Republic.
    In this situation, it was necessary for the Korean people to create a people's armed force to defend their revolutionary achievements and the independence and freedom of the motherland.
    Thus, on February 8, 1948, the Korean Workers' Party established the armed forces of the Korean people—the Korean People's Army. The Korean People's Army is a people's armed force composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of workers, peasants, and all the people. Its backbone is composed of revolutionary patriotic fighters who have received political and military training in the anti-Japanese armed struggle organized by staunch communists led by Comrade Kim Il-sung.
    The Korean Workers' Party absorbed the Soviet military science and the experience of the Soviet army, established the basic principles for army building and troop education, and gave continuous care in order to strengthen and develop the People's Army into a modern regular army. The Party cultivated new-type military and political cadres from the working people who were able to equip troops with modern technology and command and educate troops well, and established iron discipline and the principle of one-man leadership in the troops.
    The Korean Workers' Party established a political education system in the People's Army, educating the soldiers with Marxist-Leninist revolutionary thought, a lofty spirit of patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and a thought of infinite hatred for the enemy, so that the soldiers could be trained into indomitable revolutionary fighters.
    In this way, during the period of peaceful construction, the Korean People's Army reliably defended the democratic base in the northern half and the creative labor achievements of our people, and especially during the just Fatherland Liberation War to repel the armed aggression of the US-Li bandit gangs, it fully demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, mass heroism, and its invincible power.
    The heinous US imperialists not only tried every possible means to obstruct the peaceful reunification of our country, but also, in order to turn the Korean people into their slaves and further transform Korea into a bridgehead for aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, finally on June 25, 1950, according to a predetermined plan, instigated their running dog, the Li Seung-man bandit gang, to launch a sudden armed invasion against the northern half of the Republic along the entire 38th parallel.
    The people of our country faced extreme danger. All officers and men of the People's Army, who were infinitely loyal to the Party, the motherland, and the people, responded to the Party's call of "Everything for the annihilation of the enemy" and unanimously threw themselves into the sacred war to strike the aggressors.
    When our motherland was in its most difficult time, the fraternal Chinese people, holding high the banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Motherland," dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to assist the Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War with their blood.
    The Korean People's Army, in coordination with the Chinese People's Volunteers, drove the enemy who had penetrated deep into the northern half of the Republic south of the 38th parallel and liberated the entire area of the northern half of the Republic from the enemy's occupation. The Korean-Chinese People's Armies achieved great victories in the five campaigns; they also inflicted serious blows on the enemy in the active defensive warfare and frustrated the enemy's repeated and stubborn attacks step by step. The cunning aggressors, hiding behind the "truce talks," continuously launched a series of large and small offensives, such as the "Summer Offensive" and the "Autumn Offensive," which were also completely bankrupted under the strong counterattack of the Korean-Chinese People's Armies. Thus, the US aggressors had no choice but to admit their crushing defeat and signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on the 38th parallel, where they had originally launched the war of aggression.
    In the cruel flames of the three-year Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean People's Army, together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, overcame numerous difficulties, fully demonstrated a lofty spirit of patriotism, internationalism, and collective heroism, and established brilliant achievements that will be forever recorded in Korean history.
    In the fierce battles against the US aggressor troops, the Korean People's Army displayed unprecedented revolutionary heroism and patriotism, and gloriously defended the freedom and independence of the beloved motherland. Our People's Army officers and men, in the brutal war to annihilate the enemy, wholeheartedly dedicated their precious blood and lives for the freedom and independence of the motherland, for the great cause of the Party and the people, and countless Heroes of the Republic and model combatants emerged among them. Thirteen joint units and units were awarded the glorious title of Guards, 481 people were awarded the glorious title of Hero of the Republic, and more than 746,000 officers and men were awarded various national medals and badges.
    The heroic officers and men of the Chinese People's Volunteers shared weal and woe with the People's Army, demonstrated unparalleled heroism, brilliantly completed the sacred task of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending Our Homes and Motherland," and established a lofty spirit of internationalism.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers produced more than 300,000 heroes, meritorious persons, and combat models of various levels on the Korean battlefield. The entire Korean people will never forget the precious blood shed by the brave Chinese People's Volunteers on our country's territory, and the Korean people will forever sing the immortal feats established by the Chinese People's Volunteers with the greatest gratitude and warm love for generations to come.
    The guiding and leading force of the Korean people—the Korean Workers' Party—organized and inspired the victory of our people during the war.
    In order to further strengthen the combat effectiveness of the People's Army, the Party Central Committee passed a resolution in October 1950 to establish political organs and Party organizations within the People's Army. The political organs and Party organizations within the People's Army, as the most reliable helpers of the commanders, thoroughly implemented the Party's policies and resolutions, and armed every soldier of the People's Army with a spirit of loyalty to the Party and the motherland, a firm conviction in victory, a high degree of hostility to the enemy, proletarian internationalism, and noble qualities, inspiring them to establish glorious combat achievements and inspiring the entire army to move towards the final victory of the war.
    During the Fatherland Liberation War, the support and solidarity of the people of socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world powerfully inspired the Korean people and all officers and men of the People's Army who were fighting for the victory of the war.
    The people of the socialist countries of Europe and Asia, headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, regarded the suffering of the Korean people as their own and gave selfless material assistance and spiritual support to the Korean people.
    The Korean people will never forget the assistance given by the people of the socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union, and will never forget the glorious and great feats established by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield.
    The victory of the Fatherland Liberation War demonstrated the invincible vitality of the people's democratic system established in the northern half of the Republic, the solid political and moral unity of the Korean people closely united around the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, and once again showed that the forces of peace are infinitely stronger than the imperialist forces of war.
    After the war, the consistent position of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic has been that the Korean armistice should be turned into a consolidated peace, and the issue of Korean reunification should be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves without any foreign interference, and a series of concrete and feasible plans have been put forward, such as withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, reducing the military strength of North and South Korea, establishing business ties between North and South Korea, and convening an international conference of relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. At the same time, in order to realize these plans, the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic are conducting a consistent struggle.
    In order to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland, our Party and government reduced the People's Army by 80,000 in 1956, and 19 divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers have also withdrawn from Korea and returned to their motherland.
    However, the US imperialists, who are occupying South Korea, are not only trying every possible means to oppose the peaceful reunification of our motherland, but also unilaterally abandoning the armistice agreement, escalating the tension in Korea, and frantically preparing for a new military invasion.
    In this situation, the Korean People's Army, together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, strictly abides by the Korean Armistice Agreement, thwarts the enemy's adventurous actions step by step, and stands firmly on the front line of peace, guarding the revolutionary democratic base in the northern half and the creative labor achievements of all the people with high vigilance and like a copper wall and iron barrier.
    Our People's Army officers and men are not intoxicated with victory or complacent because of it. They are constantly studying the advanced Soviet military science and the experience of the Fatherland Liberation War, striving to improve their military skills to meet all the requirements of modern warfare, striving to master modern weapons and combat techniques, constantly strengthening the organizational discipline of the troops, and actively participating in the post-war reconstruction of the people's economy.
    Our People's Army officers and men, with a noble spirit of patriotism of infinite loyalty to the Party and the motherland, are constantly arming themselves, and holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, further strengthening the friendship and solidarity with the people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
    Today, as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, all the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army are filled with the determination: to be united like steel around the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, to excellently complete the glorious combat tasks entrusted by the motherland and the people, to reliably defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, and to further glorify the revolutionary and patriotic traditions of the Korean People's Army.

　　纪念朝鲜人民军建军十周年
　　朝鲜人民军上将　崔贤
    朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军全体官兵，在为祖国的和平统一和共和国北半部的社会主义建设而展开的轰轰烈烈的斗争环境中，迎接着朝鲜人民军建军十周年。
    朝鲜人民的武装力量——朝鲜人民军，在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，走过了光荣的战斗行程。
    朝鲜人民军的历史虽然不长，但这不长的历史却放射着灿烂的光辉。在这一历史期间，朝鲜人民军以对祖国和人民无限忠诚的精神，击退了帝国主义侵略者，光荣地捍卫了祖国，建立了不朽的战斗的丰功伟绩。
    我国在伟大的苏联军队帮助获得解放以后，朝鲜人民才享有了真正的自由，走上了繁荣祖国、创造新历史的道路。在共和国北半部，在党的领导下建立了人民政权，实施了各项民主改革，进而创建了和平统一祖国的革命的民主基地。然而，在我国的南半部，自从美帝国主义者登陆以来，一贯实行奴役朝鲜人民的殖民地政策，并且公然实行反对共和国北半部的侵略政策。
    在这种情况下，朝鲜人民就有必要创建保卫自己革命成果和祖国独立自由的人民武装力量。
    这样，朝鲜劳动党在1948年2月8日建立了朝鲜人民的武装力量——朝鲜人民军。朝鲜人民军是由工人、农民和全体人民的优秀儿女所组成的人民武装力量。它的骨干是在以金日成同志为首的坚定的共产主义者组织进行的抗日武装斗争中得到了政治和军事锻炼的革命爱国斗士。
    朝鲜劳动党吸取了苏联的军事科学和苏联军队的经验，树立了建军和部队教育的基本原则，并且为了使人民军加强和发展成现代的正规军而给予不断的关怀。党培养出了能够以现代的技术装备部队并能良好地指挥和教育部队的劳动人民出身的新型军政干部，在部队里建立了钢铁般的纪律和一长制的原则。
    朝鲜劳动党在人民军部队中确立了政治教育体系，以马克思列宁主义革命思想、崇高的爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神、对敌人无限憎恨的思想教育了军人，使军人们锻炼成为百折不挠的革命斗士。
    这样，朝鲜人民军在和平建设时期，可靠地保卫了北半部的民主基地和我国人民所取得的创造性的劳动成就，尤其在击退美李匪帮的武装侵略的正义的祖国解放战争时期，充分发挥了高度的爱国主义精神和群众英雄主义精神及其不可战胜的威力。
    可恶的美帝国主义，不仅千方百计地阻挠了我国的和平统一，而且为了要变朝鲜人民为自己的奴隶，进而变朝鲜为侵略中华人民共和国和苏联的桥头堡，终于在1950年6月25日，按着预定计划，嗾使走狗李承晚匪帮在三八线全线发动了对共和国北半部的突然的武装侵犯。
    我国人民面临了极大的危险。对党对祖国和对人民无限忠诚的人民军全体官兵，响应党的“一切为了歼灭敌人”的号召，一致投入了打击侵略者的神圣的战争。
    当我们的祖国最艰苦的时候，兄弟般的中国人民，高举着“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的旗帜，派遣由自己的优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军，以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民正义的祖国解放战争。
    朝鲜人民军在同中国人民志愿军的协同作战下，深入到共和国北半部的敌人被赶到了三八线以南，从敌人的强占下解放了共和国北半部的整个地区。朝中人民军队在五次的战役中取得了巨大的胜利；在积极的防御战中也给了敌人以严重的打击，步步挫败了敌人的反复不断的顽强攻击。狡猾的侵略者躲在“停战谈判”的幕后连续发动了“夏季攻势”、“秋季攻势”等大大小小一连串的攻势，也在朝中人民军队的强力反击下遭到了彻底的破产。这样，美国侵略者不得不被迫承认他们的惨败，在他们原先发动侵略战争的三八线上，签订了朝鲜停战协定。
    在三年祖国解放战争的残酷火焰中，朝鲜人民军同兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一道，克服重重困难，充分发挥了崇高的爱国主义精神、国际主义精神和集体英雄主义精神，建立了永被记载于朝鲜历史上的光辉业绩。
    朝鲜人民军在同美国侵略军的残酷战斗中，发挥了史无前例的革命英雄主义和爱国主义精神，光辉地捍卫了可爱的祖国的自由和独立。我们的人民军官兵在歼灭敌人的残酷战争中，一心一意为了祖国的自由和独立，为了党和人民的伟大事业，不惜献出了自己宝贵的鲜血和生命，他们中涌现了无数共和国英雄和模范战斗员。有十三个联合部队和部队荣获了光荣的近卫称号，四百八十一人荣获了共和国英雄的光荣称号，七十四万六千多名官兵荣获了各种国家勋章和奖章。
    英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵们，同人民军同甘苦，共生死，发挥无可比拟的英雄主义精神，光辉地完成了“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的神圣任务，树立了崇高的国际主义精神。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上一共涌现了三十余万名之多的各级英雄、功臣和战斗模范。全体朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军勇士们在我们祖国疆土上所流下的宝贵鲜血，朝鲜人民将以最大的感激和热烈的爱戴，永世万代地传颂中国人民志愿军所建立的不朽的功勋。
    朝鲜人民的指导的和领导的力量——朝鲜劳动党，在战时组织和鼓舞了我国人民的胜利。
    党中央为了进一步加强人民军的战斗力，1950年10月通过了在人民军部队内建立政治机关和党组织的决议。人民军部队内的政治机关和党组织，作为指挥官最可靠的帮助者，彻底地贯彻了党的政策和决议，并且用忠于党和祖国的精神、坚定的必胜信心、对敌人的高度的敌忾心、无产阶级国际主义精神和高尚的品质，武装了人民军的每个军人，鼓舞他们建立了光辉的战斗功勋，鼓舞全军走向了战争的最后胜利。
    在祖国解放战争时期，以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民给予朝鲜人民的支持和声援，有力地鼓舞了为战争的胜利而斗争的朝鲜人民和人民军全体官兵。
    以伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国为首的欧亚社会主义阵营各国人民，把朝鲜人民的痛苦视为自己的痛苦，给予了朝鲜人民以无私的物质援助和精神上的支持。
    朝鲜人民永不会忘记以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民给予的援助，永不会忘记中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上建立的光辉伟大的功勋。
    祖国解放战争的胜利，显示了建立在共和国北半部的人民民主制度的不可战胜的生命力，显示了紧紧团结在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府周围的朝鲜人民在政治上和道德上的坚固和统一，并且再一次表明了和平力量比帝国主义战争势力无比强大。
    战后，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府一贯坚持的立场是，朝鲜的停战应转向巩固的和平，朝鲜的统一问题应在没有任何外国干涉的条件下，由朝鲜人民自己来和平解决，并且提出了从朝鲜境内撤出一切外国军队，缩小南北朝鲜的兵力，建立南北朝鲜之间的业务联系，召开和平解决朝鲜问题的有关国家的国际会议等一系列具体可行的方案。同时，为了实现这些方案，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府进行着始终一贯的斗争。
    我们的党和政府，为了促进祖国的和平统一，1956年裁减了人民军的八万人，同时中国人民志愿军的十九个师也已经撤离朝鲜，返回祖国。
    然而，霸占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义，不仅千方百计地反对我们祖国的和平统一，而且片面地废弃停战协定，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势，疯狂地准备新的军事侵犯。
    在这种情况下，朝鲜人民军同兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一道，严格地遵守着朝鲜停战协定，步步粉碎着敌人的冒险行动，坚定地屹立在和平的前哨上，以高度的警惕，铜墙铁壁般地保卫着北半部的革命的民主基地和全体人民创造性的劳动果实。
    我们的人民军官兵，丝毫没有为胜利所陶醉或因此而自满，他们不断地研究着苏联的先进军事科学和祖国解放战争时期的经验，努力提高自己的军事技能，以适应于现代战争的一切要求，努力精通现代武器和战斗技术，不断地加强部队的组织纪律，并且积极参加战后人民经济的恢复建设。
    我们的人民军官兵，以无限忠诚于党和祖国的高尚的爱国主义精神，不断地武装着自己，并且高举着无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，进一步加强同以苏联、中华人民共和国为首的兄弟各国人民之间的友谊团结。
    在庆祝朝鲜人民军建军十周年的今天，朝鲜人民军的全体将士充满着这样的决心：钢铁般地团结在以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的周围，将出色地完成祖国和人民所委托的光荣的战斗任务，可靠地捍卫社会主义阵营的东方前哨，进一步光辉地发扬朝鲜人民军的革命的爱国的传统。
