    Sulphur Mountain

    A natural sulfur deposit has been discovered in the western part of the Qilian Mountains. It is located in Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, Gansu Province. The mineral belt runs from southeast to northwest, and over a range of 29 kilometers, yellow natural sulfur is exposed on the surface everywhere, emitting a strong, suffocating sulfurous odor. Local herders call this area "Sulphur Mountain." After preliminary exploration by geological personnel at three locations, the reserves are initially estimated to be several hundred thousand tons.

    Natural sulfur deposits are also called native sulfur, and such deposits are not commonly found in China. Judging from the mineral samples taken, this deposit is mostly high-grade ore with a sulfur content of over 20%. It can be mined open-pit in the future.

    硫磺山
    祁连山西部发现一个自然硫磺矿。它位于甘肃省肃北蒙古族自治县境内，矿带从东南走向西北，在二十九公里长的范围，到处有黄色的自然硫露出在地表，散发着浓郁窒鼻的硫磺味。附近牧民把这一带称为“硫磺山”。经过地质人员在三个地点进行初步勘探，初步推算，储量约有几十万吨。
    自然硫矿又叫天然硫，这种矿藏在我国发现的还不多。从取回的矿样来看，这个矿大部分是含硫量在20％以上的富矿，将来可进行露天开采。
