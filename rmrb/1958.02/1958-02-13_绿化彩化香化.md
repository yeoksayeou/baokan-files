    "How to Green, Colorize, and Beautify Shanghai with Fragrance" is the title of an eye-catching news item in the February 10th edition of the "Liberation Daily." The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee specifically invited more than forty horticulturists, botanists, professors, and engineering technicians to a forum. The scientists present put forward many valuable suggestions. Someone analyzed Shanghai's climatic conditions and expressed confidence that Shanghai's suburbs could be full of fruit trees everywhere. Someone suggested planting more fragrant plants from the perspective of Shanghai's fragrance industry needs. Someone suggested appropriately cultivating bonsai and potted woody plants on the roofs and balconies of tall buildings to bring "a hundred flowers blooming" to Shanghai. Many people expressed their willingness to participate in the work of "three transformations."

    绿化彩化香化
    “上海如何绿化彩化香化”这是10日解放日报上一条引人注意的消息的标题。上海市人民委员会专门邀请了四十多位园艺和植物学家、教授、工程技术人员举行座谈会。到会的科学工作者提出了许多宝贵意见。有人分析了上海的气候条件，满怀信心地表示，一定能使上海郊区处处有果树。有人从上海芳香工业的需要出发，认为应该多种芳香植物。有人建议在高楼大厦的屋顶、凉台上适当栽培盆景和盆栽的木本植物，使上海来个“百花齐放”。许多人都表示愿意参加“三化”的工作。
