Cadre Transference to Rural Areas

　　A Thousand Jin of Rice per Mu!
    Walking through Tiankang Township in Minhou County, Fujian Province, people always praise Nie Daochan's name when they mention his achievement in leading the masses to create high-yield fields producing a thousand jin per mu in the mountainous area.
    Nie Daochan was originally the deputy director of the Forestry Bureau of Minhou County. He was transferred to work in Tiankang Township in the mountains in February of last year. From the first day he arrived in Tiankang Township, he took off his shoes and actively participated in production with the farmers, leading the masses forward.
    This township is surrounded by mountains, with many mountains and large ridges, and the land is barren and yields are very low. Many people always feel that there is not much "potential" to be found in agricultural production in mountainous areas. After Nie Daochan came to the mountainous area, he had been considering this question: How to break the masses' inherent prejudices and actively transform the face of the mountainous area?
    When he first proposed "changing single-season rice to double-season rice," the masses generally couldn't accept it. At this time, he went deep into the masses to understand the situation and found that the township had experimented in 1956, and the result was that two seasons were not as good as one, with a reduction of fifty or sixty jin of grain per mu. Therefore, the masses said in disappointment: "Changing single to double is a production reduction measure."
    Faced with this situation, Nie Daochan was not discouraged. He spent a few days studying the issue with old farmers. The old farmer Zhang Xianjin said that based on the experience of other places and our own experience, changing single to double will definitely increase production. The main reason for the failure of double-season rice in 1956 was that more than 30 mu of "green water fields" that should not have been changed were also changed. Secondly, the season was delayed by fifteen days beyond the "Grain Rain" period, and some fields were fertilized too little, far from meeting the needs of double-season and dense planting. Later, he also heard that a field of single-season rice changed to double-season rice by Zhang Lirend's production team increased production by 30% compared to the previous year. So, Nie Daochan asked Zhang Lirend to introduce the process of the change to everyone, educating the masses and rekindling their enthusiasm.
    The first double-cropping rice was planted in the mountains. As the saying goes, "Whatever has a mouth needs to eat, whatever has roots needs fertilizer." When it came time to transplant late rice seedlings, they encountered a shortage of fertilizer. At this time, he and others went to the mountains to find fertilizer sources. In the thickets of miscellaneous trees, they collected more than two hundred dan of bird droppings. At the same time, he mobilized the masses to carry out a "three cleanings" (clean ditches, clean pits, clean sheds) fertilizer accumulation campaign, accumulating more than eight hundred dan of fertilizer.
    After a year of hard work, the double-cropping rice on 90 mu of single-season fields in the township was successful. Among them, the yield per mu of 12 mu of mountain rice even reached a thousand jin! (Zeng Quan)

　　Liming is Busy Picking Manure
    At the crack of dawn, the streets in Huishui County, Guizhou Province, were very quiet. The morning north wind was bitterly cold. Several people in cadre uniforms were carrying manure baskets on their shoulders, searching for cow and horse manure along the street. These manure pickers are comrades from the General Office of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee who have been transferred to the ShouChuang cooperative in Huishui County to engage in labor production.
    Not long after they arrived here, they saw the leadership's instructions on vigorously carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement in the Guizhou Daily, and they actively participated in this movement. From that time on, not only could these people be seen picking manure in the fields and on the hillsides of Changling Township, but also in the streets and alleys of Huishui City, one could often encounter this group of young people carrying manure baskets, asking door to door: "Uncle, Auntie, do you have livestock? We are here to collect manure." Once, an old lady at a horse shop saw them wearing cadre uniforms, and the woman still had a wisp of partially permed hair, so she asked with a smile: "Are you the cadres who came down from Guiyang to be farmers?" "Yes, old lady, we are here to learn from the farmers," one of the young people replied with a smile. "Ah, Mao Zedong's cadres are both civil and military. Good! Let's go to the backyard. No one has cleaned the manure in my pigsty for years, and there are also piles of horse manure, which are washed all over the yard when it rains..." The old lady said excitedly as she walked to the backyard.
    In this way, they often crawled into pigsties and stables, raking out piles of manure and carrying them back to the cooperative in manure baskets. Although the stinking smell rushed into their noses, their faces always showed a happy expression. Especially when they encountered the most good manure, they were as happy as explorers discovering rare mineral deposits. They said excitedly: "We are simply mining for gold!" In the past ten days or so, some comrades have accumulated more than a thousand jin of fertilizer.

　　The First Lesson in Labor
    It was my third day at the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Guizigou Township, Jilin City. In the morning, the oxen were already harnessed to the sleds, the horses were harnessed to the rubber-wheeled carts, and the people had all arrived. Thus began the first day of our new life. My task was to load the carts, loading manure onto the carts to be pulled to the fields.
    I picked up a pickaxe and began hacking at the unloosened manure pile. Team Leader Chen and Director Yang didn't want me to do it, fearing that I couldn't handle it since I was new to the work. So I had to put down the pickaxe and pick up a shovel to load manure onto the cart. The production team leader instructed Li Bangquan, a member of the cooperative who was working with me, to help me and teach me the technique of shoveling manure. When I heard this, I felt a little unconvinced: "Can't I even shovel manure?"
    In the sub-zero weather, the manure was already frozen solid. The manure that had been dug up was still like a stone, making a "ding-dang" sound as the shovel struck it. An old woman watched me curiously. Seeing my effort in shoveling manure, she obviously couldn't stand it: "You can't do it like that! The manure is frozen solid, you can't shovel down from the top like that! Shovel around the edge, and add a kick with your foot, so it's not strenuous, and you can shovel it full. You have to find the trick to work!" She turned to Li Bangquan and said, "You teach him, he's new here, he doesn't know!" I did as she instructed, and it really had a good effect. At this time, I couldn't help but think of what the production team leader had said just now, and my face felt hot. I worked hard, the more I worked, the more interesting it became, and I didn't even straighten my back, filling a sled of manure in one breath. A member of the cooperative saw that I was doing it wrong and came up to me and said with concern: "You can't do it like this! You can't be impatient when working, you have to do it evenly. If you do it like this, you'll be exhausted before noon!" I looked at him with gratitude and began to work slowly and evenly according to what he said.
    The sun gradually set, and it was time to rest. I unharnessed the livestock, carrying the shovel and pickaxe, and walked into the warm room. Everyone summarized the day's labor achievements and rated them. I got seven points (full marks)! With gratitude and an unprecedentedly pleasant mood, I accepted the first baptism of labor. The fatigue immediately disappeared, and I felt strength all over my body again.

　　People's School Restored
    Zhou Sihui, a 22-year-old girl. After being transferred to the Jufeng Agricultural Cooperative in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, on November 5th last year, she not only worked hard in labor training, but also actively helped farmers learn culture.
    There are more than 40 young and middle-aged people in the Fourth Production Brigade of the Jufeng Agricultural Cooperative, but only one of them is a junior high school student, and only six have the equivalent of a higher elementary school education. With a low level of education, it is not only difficult to learn advanced technology, but it is also inconvenient to record work points. The work point numbers they recorded were often blurred and unclear, and after a long time, they couldn't even recognize them themselves. When settling accounts, they often had disputes and quarrels because of this. Some members of the cooperative who were illiterate even used receipts for buying chaff to buy grain. In the past, there was also a people's school here, but for various reasons, it had not been in session for more than a year.
    After Zhou Sihui learned about this situation, she made up her mind to revive the people's school. She first talked to the members of the cooperative to understand the reasons for the school's closure. Member Bao Yongjie told her: In the past, one school was run by a large brigade, the journey was far, it was very inconvenient to go to class at night, and it affected the production of the next day. The opinions of the other members were similar to those of Bao Yongjie. Zhou Sihui told Li Maogui and Zhong He the opinions of the members. Li Maogui and Zhong He were cadres who were transferred to this team with her. After hearing these opinions, they were also willing to help the farmers revive the people's school. After they studied, they decided to establish three people's schools with the small team as the unit, and they would each serve as teachers.
    Soon, three people's schools were established. The members of the cooperative didn't have money to buy literacy textbooks, so Zhou Sihui took out seven yuan to buy them. Zhou Sihui taught the members of the cooperative a class every other night. Now, in the people's school she teaches, there are already eight or nine members who regularly persist in learning.

    下放干部在农村
　　亩产千斤稻！
    走过福建省闽侯县田壋乡，人们一提起聂道灿的名字，总要夸他带领群众创造山区千斤丰产田的成绩。
    聂道灿原是闽侯县林业局副局长，去年2月份下放到高山的田壋乡工作。他到田壋乡的第一天起，就脱掉鞋子，积极地和农民一起参加生产，带领群众前进。
    这个乡是一个群山环抱的乡，山多岭大，土地贫瘠，产量很低，很多人总感到山区的农业生产没有多大“文章”可做。聂道灿来到山区以后，就一直考虑这个问题：怎样打破群众固有的成见，积极起来改造山区面貌呢？
    当他第一次提出“单季稻改双季稻”时，群众普遍接受不了。这时他就深入群众中去了解，发现这个乡1956年曾作过试验，结果两季不如一季收，每亩减产五、六十斤粮食。因此群众失望地说：“单改双，是个减产措施”。
    遇到这个情况，聂道灿并没有灰心，他花了几天时间和老农专门研究这个问题。老农张先进说，从外地的经验以及我们自己的体会来看，单改双肯定要增产。1956年双季稻失败的主要原因，是“青水田”不应该改的也改了三十多亩。其次是季节超过“谷雨”迟了十五天，还有些田施肥太少，远不能满足双季又密植的需要。后来，他又听说张礼仁生产队一丘季稻改双季稻的田，比前年增产了三成。于是，聂道灿就请张礼仁向大家介绍改制的经过，教育群众重新鼓起了劲头。
    山区第一次插上了连作稻。常言说得好，“长嘴的要吃，生根的要肥。”当开始插晚稻秧时，就碰到了缺肥的困难。这时候，他就和别人到山里去找肥源。在杂树丛中，他们收集了二百多担鸟粪。同时他又发动群众，开展了“三清”（清沟、清坑、清舍）积肥运动，共积了八百多担肥料。
    经过一年的努力，全乡九十亩单季田改双季田的连作稻成功了。其中十二亩山区稻的亩产量，还达到了一千斤！　（曾全）
    黎明拣粪忙
    天麻麻亮，贵州省惠水县城里街道上十分清静。清晨的北风吹得冷飕飕的。有几个穿干部服的人，肩上挑着粪筐，沿街寻找着牛粪马粪。这些拣粪的人，就是中共贵州省委办公厅下放到惠水首创社劳动生产的同志。
    他们到这里不久，就在贵州日报上看到了领导上关于大力开展积肥运动的指示，便先后积极投入了这个运动。从那时候起，不仅在长岭乡的田坝里、在山坡上能见到这些人在拣粪，就是在惠水城区的大街小巷也经常能遇到这群青年小伙子挑着粪筐，挨家逐户地问：“大伯、大妈，你家喂了牲口没有？我们是来要粪的。”有一次，一家马店老太太见到他们穿着干部服装，女的头上还有一绺尚未最后剪完的烫发，就笑眯眯地问：“你们就是贵阳下来当农民的干部吗？”“是的，老大妈，我们是来向农民学习的。”其中一个年轻人带笑回答她。“唉呵，毛主席的干部就是文武双全哩。好！我们到后院去，我家猪圈里几年的粪都没有人掏了，马粪也有几大堆，一下雨来冲得满院都是。……”老太太兴奋地边说边走向后院。
    就这样，他们经常钻到猪圈里、马房里，把粪一堆一堆地耙出来，又装到粪筐里挑回社去。虽然那股腥臭的气味往鼻子里扑，但他们的脸上总是显露着愉快的神气。特别是每当遇到好粪最多的时候，就似勘探队员发现了稀有的矿苗那么高兴，他们兴奋地说：“我们简直是在掏金子呀！”十多天来，有的同志已经积了一千多斤肥。

　　劳动第一课
    是我到吉林市郊贵子沟乡红星农业社的第三天。早晨，牛已架上了爬犁，马也架上了胶皮车，人们也都已来到，于是就开始了我们新生活的第一天。我的任务是装车，把粪装上车拉到地里去。
    我拿起洋镐往没有刨松的粪堆刨去。陈队长和杨主任好歹也不叫我干，为的是怕我乍一干活受不了。于是我只好放下洋镐，拿起洋铲往车上上粪。生产队长吩咐同我一起干活的社员李邦权，要他帮助我，教我铲粪技术。我一听这话，心里有些不服气：“难道我铲粪也不会吗？”
    零下十几度的天气，粪已经冻硬了，刨过来的粪，还是像石头一样，打得洋铲叮当地响。一位老大娘好奇地看着我。她看我铲粪这股劲，显然是耐不住了：“你这样干那行哩！粪冻硬了，从上面铲下去那行哩！绕着边铲，再加脚一蹬，这样又不费劲，又铲得满满的，干活也得找窍门呀！”她回过头来对李邦权说：“你教教人家，他乍来，不会嘛！”我照着她指点的做去，的确收到了良好的效果。这时我不由地想起刚才生产队长的话来，脸上热烘烘的。我使劲地干，越干越有趣，连腰也不直一直，一口气就装满了一爬犁粪。一位社员看到我这样干不对头，就走到我面前，关怀地说：“你这样干，不行呀！干活不能性急，要匀匀的干。你这样干，保准不到一上午就把你累垮！”我带着感激的心情看了看他，依着他的说法缓缓匀匀地干起来。
    太阳渐渐西沉，该休息了。卸下牲口，荷着洋铲和洋镐，走进暖室。大伙儿总结一天来的劳动成绩，进行评分，我得到了七分（满分）！我带着感激和从所未有的极为愉快的心情，接受了劳动的第一次洗礼，疲倦立时消失，浑身又有了力量。
                        （萧克昌）
    民校恢复了
    周思辉，一个二十二岁的姑娘。她于去年11月5日下放到湖南省衡阳市驹峰农业社后，不但努力进行劳动锻炼，还积极帮助农民学习文化。
    驹峰农业社第四生产大队，有四十多个青壮年，但其中只有一个初中生，相当于高小文化水平的，也只有六人。文化水平低，不要说学习先进技术有困难，就是记个工分也不方便。他们记的工分数字常常模糊不清，日子久了，连自己也认不清楚。清工结账时，他们常因此闹起纠纷，争吵不休。有的社员不识字，还拿买糠的折子去买粮食。过去，这里也有一所民校，但由于许多原因，已经一年多没有上课了。
    周思辉了解到这一情况后，就下定决心要把民校再办起来。她首先找社员谈话，了解民校停课的原因。社员包永洁告诉她：过去一个大队办一个民校，路程远，晚上去上课很不方便，而且影响第二天的生产。别的社员的意见，和包永洁的差不多。周思辉把社员的意见告诉了李茂贵、钟鹤。李茂贵和钟鹤是和她一块下放到这个队的干部，听到这些意见后，也愿意帮助农民把民校再办起来。经过他们研究后，决定以小队为单位成立三所民校，由他们三人分别兼任教员。
    不久，三所民校成立了。社员没有钱买识字课本，周思辉就拿出七元钱给他们买。周思辉隔一天晚上，给社员们上一次课。如今，她所教的那个民校，经常坚持学习的社员已经有八、九人了。（邓秀海）（附图片）
