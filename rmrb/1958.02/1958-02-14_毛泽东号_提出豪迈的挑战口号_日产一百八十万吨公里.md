Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 13th. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive group has put forward the ambitious goal of an average daily production of 1.8 million ton-kilometers throughout the year, challenging all railway locomotive groups nationwide. This was proposed by Cai Lianxing, chief driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, and driver Hu Chundong at the 1958 Advanced Producers and Employee Representatives Conference of the Beijing Railway Administration.

Before the conference, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive group had already guaranteed an average daily production of 1.5 million ton-kilometers throughout the year. After the conference opened, representatives from various sections and stations compared their advanced experiences, tapped potential, and set new leap forward targets. Therefore, Cai Lianxing and Hu Chundong decided to make another great leap forward. They analyzed that on February 3rd, the locomotive ran six round trips, and with only two trains exceeding the traction quota, it reached more than 1.6 million ton-kilometers. The situation on the 4th and 5th was similar to the 3rd. They believe that if the locomotive is well maintained, pulls fewer empty cars, or can mix light and heavy loads, it is possible to complete an average daily production of 1.8 million ton-kilometers throughout the year. At the same time, various departments of the Beijing Railway Administration are also making great leaps forward. Freight transport workers are loading more goods, and train operation workers are compiling more over-axle trains, creating favorable conditions for locomotives to pull more and run faster.

The "Mao Zedong" locomotive group also proposed that the coal saving plan be increased from 270 tons to 400 tons, and the technical speed be increased from 50 kilometers to 53.5 kilometers. (Attached picture)

### “毛泽东号”提出豪迈的挑战口号  日产一百八十万吨公里

    “毛泽东号”提出豪迈的挑战口号
    日产一百八十万吨公里
    新华社天津13日电　“毛泽东号”机车组提出全年平均日产一百八十万吨公里的奋斗目标，向全国铁路机车组挑战。这是“毛泽东号”机车司机长蔡连兴和司机胡春东在北京铁路管理局1958年先进生产者及职工代表会议上提出的。
    “毛泽东号”机车组在这次会议召开以前，就提出全年平均日产一百五十万吨公里的保证。会议开幕以后，各段、站的代表互比先进，挖掘潜力，订出了新的跃进指标，因此蔡连兴和胡春东就研究决定再来个大跃进。他们分析了在2月3日这一天，机车来回跑了六趟，仅有两列车超过牵引定数就达到了一百六十多万吨公里；4日、5日两天的情况也同3日差不多。他们认为如果保养好机车，拉的空车少，或者能轻重混编，全年平均完成日产一百八十万吨公里是可能的。同时北京铁路管理局的各个部门都在跃进，货运职工要多装，车务职工要多编超轴列车等，也为机车多拉快跑创造了有利条件。
    “毛泽东号”机车组同时提出，节煤计划要从二百七十吨增加到四百吨，技术速度从五十公里提高到五十三点五公里。（附图片）
