Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th dispatch from TASS: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, received MacDonald, the foreign editor of the British "The Times" on January 31, and discussed with him important international issues such as disarmament, summit meetings, the situation in the Middle East, and some domestic issues in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union hopes to fundamentally solve the disarmament problem and ultimately eliminate the army.

The first question raised by MacDonald was: What results does the Soviet government hope to achieve by putting forward the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons as the second item for discussion at the summit meeting?

Khrushchev said that we hope to fundamentally solve the disarmament problem. We advocate the ultimate elimination of the army and its replacement by a civil police system, that is, no armed forces in the country, but only a civil police force to maintain domestic security. Before the October Revolution and in the initial period after the October Revolution, our party did consider establishing a national police force to replace the standing army. Mr. Churchill taught us a lesson because he organized an attack on the Soviet Union. Indeed, Britain and Churchill himself had a great influence, forcing our country to build its own powerful army to defend the Soviet state from enemy aggression. But I want to emphasize that the existence of a standing army is not out of our belief, but is caused by a certain situation. We are internationalists and believe in the friendly cooperation of the people of all countries. Our goal is not war, but peace.

Khrushchev continued, if we attach great importance to our army, it is out of necessity. Since capitalist countries cannot survive without an army, then we should also have an army. If there must be an army, then this army must be capable of resisting any forces that threaten us. Some people accuse us of trying to impose our will on other countries with the help of a powerful armed force; they accuse us of wanting to impose our ideology on other countries. Mr. Dulles can be said to have reached the pinnacle in this regard. But this is nonsense. I think even Mr. Dulles himself does not believe what he says. If he continues to say so, it is simply to achieve propaganda purposes and arouse hatred towards the Soviet Union.

The victory of communism in the world does not require armed forces.

Sometimes, some people quote my remarks, saying that I expressed belief in the victory of our cause, that is, the cause of communism, in the world. Our enemies then make a big fuss based on this, saying that the Soviet Union maintains a powerful armed force in order to achieve its goals by force, that is, to conquer the world. This is also nonsense.

If we talk about the victory of communism in the world, then this primarily refers to the inevitable victory of communist ideas, the victory of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, and the development of all countries in accordance with the objective laws discovered by Marx and Lenin, which are independent of people's will. And in order to achieve the victory of advanced ideas that reflect the urgent needs of social development, there is no need for armed forces, neither traditional armed forces nor atomic armed forces. If a theory is correct and reflects the laws of social development, it will surely capture the minds and consciousness of millions of people and become the greatest force in the struggle for new and advanced things.

For example, we don't need to teach the British to carry out a revolution and establish a socialist system in their country. When they are convinced that the existing system in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries can give the people more benefits than the capitalist system, when they are convinced that there are unlimited possibilities under the socialist system for people to better develop their talents, they will do it themselves. This is our view.

Khrushchev said that the people of all countries will solve the problems of social development themselves. If the people wish to take the socialist road, we can only welcome and sympathize with this wish, but if they are unwilling to do so and are willing to retain the old social lifestyle on a capitalist basis, we will not consider this a reason for war; this cannot become a reason for conflict between the people of all countries.

Khrushchev pointed out that in order to promote communist ideas, and to spread and consolidate these ideas in people's minds, what is needed is not an army, but peace. Indeed, we firmly believe that our ideas are bound to win. But what will bring victory to these ideas is not war, but the higher living standards of the people under the socialist system, the higher development of culture, science, art, and everything else that mankind needs for survival rather than death. Any hydrogen bomb or rocket is powerless to oppose this; any Atlantic Treaty or Baghdad Pact cannot stop the spread of scientific communist ideas, because due to the logic of life itself, this idea is increasingly grasping people's minds and hearts.

Our confidence and belief in the inevitable victory of communism is based on this. Everyone will surely move towards this goal, but it is difficult to say when. This is a long road.

Khrushchev said that when all the people in the world or a large part of the people in the world are moving towards communism, there will be some distribution of labor and obligations among these people. This is not competition, but comradely cooperation, rationally allocating forces in order to spend less and produce more products to meet the needs of society and people's lives. This is our ideal, this is our goal. Does it require an international war to achieve this goal?

However, the ruling groups in Western countries hate our country, hate other socialist countries, and hate our communist ideas, and want to eliminate us, so we have to preserve our armed forces to defend the achievements of our people. Now, when the Soviet Union is no longer alone, and the powerful socialist camp uniting nearly one billion people is growing stronger and more consolidated, this hope of eliminating socialist countries by force is a arrogant hope. This is completely impossible.

That is why we want to retain our powerful armed forces, which can frustrate the arrogance of the imperialist madmen.

Khrushchev said that some politicians in capitalist countries hope to force the Soviet Union into a more acute "cold war" environment, so that the Soviet Union will spend more funds on armaments, in order to weaken our country's economic strength and hinder its development in a peaceful direction. However, despite their implementation of the "cold war" policy, our country's economic development speed still greatly exceeds and will continue to exceed all capitalist countries. The facts eloquently prove this. The day is not far off when we will catch up with the most advanced capitalist countries and surpass them in terms of per capita output. By then, everyone will see more clearly the undeniable superiority of the socialist system.

Therefore, the Soviet Union has no interest in the arms race and maintaining the "cold war" policy, based on realistic conditions and future prospects. We advocate eliminating the "cold war" policy, establishing the most sincere and friendly relations with all countries, and achieving complete disarmament and the elimination of armed forces. But obviously, our counterpart is not prepared to do so at present.

Khrushchev pointed out that in politics, sometimes it is necessary to follow the rules of gradual transition, solving problems in several stages. Initially, we can first solve uncomplicated and mature problems, and then, when the conditions of greater international trust are in place, we can transition to the next stage, gradually achieving complete disarmament and establishing friendly relations between countries. We advocate a comprehensive and thorough solution to the disarmament problem, but we know that our counterpart is obviously not prepared to do so. Although we advocate establishing friendly relations, we also understand that it cannot be done with just a word. We do not completely trust our Western partners, and they do not completely trust us. Let us live together and see, let us interact with each other more often, develop trade, so as to prove that we are not "cannibals", and we eat the same things as our partners.

The reason why I want to say so much to answer the first question is because I think this is the starting point for other questions.

When an agreement is reached on stopping nuclear tests, the Soviet Union is also prepared to accept supervision.

The second question raised by MacDonald was about the supervision of stopping nuclear weapons testing. He asked Khrushchev whether he thought that the testing of nuclear bombs or other explosive devices could not be detected from afar.

Khrushchev said that I think it is impossible, because explosions can always be detected. When an agreement is reached on stopping nuclear weapons testing, if other countries think it is necessary to establish supervision, we are also prepared to accept this. Supervisory posts must be reasonably arranged within our country and other countries, so that those who are unwilling to eliminate the "cold war" and insist that we are opposed to establishing supervision in order to continue secret nuclear weapons testing will have no excuses.

Khrushchev refuted the Americans' claim of a "clean" hydrogen bomb. He said that this kind of discussion does not help disarmament and eliminating the "cold war", but is to continue implementing the "position of strength" policy. Honest scientists in the United States, Britain, and other countries have refuted the possibility of manufacturing a "clean" hydrogen bomb.

Khrushchev mentioned in the conversation that it is a terrible thing for planes carrying already armed hydrogen bombs to fly over peaceful cities. The policy associated with bombers equipped with hydrogen bombs flying over Britain can be called a stupid policy.

We must seek ways to prepare for the summit meeting that can avoid it ending in failure.

The third question raised by MacDonald was: Is the Soviet government inclined to agree to postpone the summit meeting from the "next two or three months" suggested by the Soviet Union to a later date, if this makes the meeting more likely to be held?

Khrushchev said that the next two or three months is what we assumed. As long as it is beneficial, the date can be postponed. Speaking of this, I remember something: When I was a young fitter, the factory owner paid wages irregularly, sometimes once every two or three months. I remember that a mine once posted a notice: "Wages will be paid at the end of the month," but it did not specify which year or which month. We are also a little worried that the summit meeting will also be set for "the end of the month" without specifying which month or which year.

MacDonald then asked Khrushchev whether he would still oppose convening a meeting of foreign ministers if the meeting of foreign ministers was limited to preparing for the summit meeting.

Khrushchev said that I personally have never opposed making good preparations for the summit meeting. It is originally logical that the existence of foreign ministers is to handle international issues. However, if you have a child, you naturally want a good nanny to take care of it. You want to choose a nanny who can ensure the safety of your child. If you are a person who likes flowers and hire a gardener to plant flowers, you naturally want to try to find a gardener who is not only very capable and knowledgeable in this area, but also cherishes, cultivates, and cares for these flowers. Unfortunately, among the foreign ministers there are still "gardeners" who make people worry about the fate of the flowers and "nannies" who make people worry about the fate of the children. In other words, we are worried that the summit meeting will die in the embryonic stage. Then what we will get will not be a baby, but a miscarriage. This is what we are worried about. We must seek a way to prepare for the summit meeting that can avoid this consequence. It is also possible that this meeting needs to be prepared through diplomatic means.

MacDonald said in the conversation that after the summit meeting, the foreign ministers must also meet to complete the resolutions formulated by the heads of government. It can be seen that even after the summit meeting, the results will still be sabotaged.

Khrushchev said that this is entirely possible. Even after the summit talks, the agreements reached may be sabotaged. We hope that the summit talks can become the force that pulls international relations out of the current state, because this will give more hope for reaching positive resolutions. After the summit meeting, the ministers can continue to work, but then it will be more difficult for them to obstruct, and they will have to consider public opinion.

If the people of all countries conclude that the "cold war" must be eliminated, then no force can stop this, and a solution will eventually be found. Those who oppose eliminating the "cold war" are very clear about this, so they are afraid of the meeting of heads of government and afraid of achieving positive results at the summit meeting. It must be known that after the public obtains the first few positive results, they will exert stronger pressure to continue to improve international relations. The enemies of peace always portray the Soviet Union as an evil force, saying that the Soviet Union is untrustworthy, unreliable, and so on, regardless of the facts. But the people of all countries are tired of hearing this kind of talk, and they are beginning to ignore it. It seems that a summit meeting is inevitable.

The plan to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe is one of the steps towards achieving complete disarmament.

MacDonald asked whether the plan for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe could be combined with an agreement to reduce conventional forces in this region.

Khrushchev said that what is intended to be resolved here is not a narrow problem, but a broader problem. We insist on the position of complete disarmament. The further we advance in this regard in the first stage, the easier it will be to achieve the ultimate goal. We are willing to completely ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, achieve complete disarmament, completely withdraw foreign troops stationed in other countries' territories, and eliminate foreign bases in other countries' territories. We know that our counterpart is unwilling to solve the problem in this way, so we suggest solving the problem gradually and in stages, suggesting that we not start with a fundamental solution to the disarmament problem, but with a gradual solution to the disarmament problem. In this way, we can achieve the main goal step by step, which is to achieve a solution to the problem of complete disarmament.

If the major powers do not interfere, the Arab countries and Israel can improve relations more quickly.

MacDonald then asked Khrushchev whether he thought it might be better for all parties to temporarily suspend the supply of weapons to the Middle East region for one or two years as a prerequisite for easing tensions.

Khrushchev said that this is a wise path. We said in London that it is appropriate for both sides to stop supplying weapons to the Middle East region. Obviously, not only should the supply of weapons to the Middle East region be delayed, but an agreement should also be reached on the point of not interfering in their affairs, so that their sovereignty and independence can be recognized. All this should be done in such a way that the people of Arab countries do not think that we are announcing a postponement to make them unarmed, thereby providing opportunities for the aggressive forces of other countries to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries or to invade them and deprive them of their independence as they please. This is a bad and harmful practice. We must anticipate this and eliminate this phenomenon. If we simply announce a postponement, then the Arabs will think that the Soviet Union has changed its policy and abandoned the principles that we have already announced and are strictly implementing. Our principles originate from the United Nations Charter: we safeguard the sovereignty and independence of Arab countries, and advocate that other countries do not interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, and so on.

When talking about the relations between Arab countries and Israel, Khrushchev said that we believe that if the major powers do not interfere, then the Arab countries and Israel themselves can reach mutual understanding more quickly and reach an agreement on their mutual relations. This will help achieve peace in the region and help seek the possibility of eliminating tensions there. If some kind of external intervention is taken now, there may not be any benefits, because the mutual relations there are very acute. It seems that the leaders of the Israeli state should better consider the current specific situation and consider the interests of the Arab world. At present, Israel often not only does not consider these interests, but also openly despises them and takes a provocative attitude towards Arab countries.

In order to make the most rational use of the Soviet Union's material resources and other resources, the role of the party is constantly growing.

MacDonald asked Khrushchev to explain how the growing role of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union should be understood, and whether the appointment of many party secretaries indicates that the role of the Central Committee of the Communist Party is growing.

Khrushchev said that your understanding of this question is very correct. Yes, the changes you mentioned indicate the growing role of the Communist Party in our country's life, and obviously this role will grow even more in the future. Now here, some of the previous forms and methods of administrative connections between districts, states, and republics have been weakened. At the same time, the ideological connections between states and republics have been strengthened and consolidated, and the unity of the Soviet people has been further consolidated. In this regard, the Communist Party plays a decisive role, and the role of the party is strengthening. The people of our country are a unified and friendly family. The factors that form this family are: their political views are consistent, their political goals are consistent, and their personal interests are the same. Every Soviet republic considers its own characteristics to solve the tasks it faces in accordance with the general tasks facing the Soviet Union. We believe that solving economic and administrative problems is the internal affair of every republic and every nation.

The mutual relations between the various ethnic groups in our country are constantly developing. The various functions of the state are also changing. When our country creates the conditions for transitioning to a communist society, many institutions of state administration will gradually disappear. The army, courts, procuratorates, and other institutions will perish. It looks like the courts will exist longer than the army and other administrative institutions. It is also possible that the courts will continue to exist, of course, with some changes. It must be known that various disputes will still occur between people, and there should be an arbitration institution to resolve these disputes.

I do not intend to speculate on the changes in our society in a more distant period, but now our social life is already developing in the direction of Marxist-Leninist principles. In this case, in order to make the most rational use of our existing material resources and other resources, the role of the party is constantly growing. The party has a more powerful foundation than state institutions. The emergence and existence of the party is not the result of certain legislative obligations. The development of the party is derived from people's political views, that is, from those circumstances caused by the state of spiritual factors. And mankind will always need spiritual factors.

Due to the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, the current situation of Soviet industry and agriculture is much better than in the past.

MacDonald finally asked Khrushchev whether he was satisfied with the implementation of the plan to reorganize the management of industry and construction.

Khrushchev said that not only am I satisfied, I am simply extremely happy. This even exceeded all our boldest expectations and predictions. Due to the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, our strength has grown a lot, and the situation of domestic industry and agriculture is now much better than in the past. And now, when we are carrying out the work of reorganizing machine tractor stations, we will guarantee to better stimulate the development of our economy, especially agriculture.

All these phenomena are easy to explain. In the past, we mainly used administrative factors to lead the work of industrial enterprises and agriculture. But the forces of the party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League did not fully exert the initiative they could have exerted. Now, in the case of decentralized management of industry, the leadership of industry and construction has been transferred to the local level, closer to enterprises and construction sites. Therefore, the influence of the party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League organizations on the work of enterprises has been unprecedentedly improved. These organizations are more active and proactive, and their sense of responsibility for completing the plan has increased. And the plan itself is formulated with the participation of the enterprise. There is much more that can be said on this topic. But if we put it simply, we should emphasize that we have received excellent results due to the implementation of the measures to reorganize the management of industry and construction. It is of course very difficult for one minister to lead the entire domestic industry from a center located in Moscow. At that time, the minister should stand higher than God, because he has to know and see what Sakhalin Island, Kamchatka, Baku, or Armenia are doing. But this is an inconceivable thing. Now we have transferred the power to solve all the problems in the work of enterprises to the local level, which can only benefit the work.

MacDonald then said that your country's improvements in agriculture are indeed huge.

Khrushchev said, but there must be even greater improvements. In September 1953, after we implemented certain measures in agriculture, we overcame the phenomenon of stagnation. Later, we revised several laws to create better conditions for the development of agriculture, and then agriculture began to develop rapidly and gain momentum.

If we can break the deadlock between countries, it will have a good impact on improving international relations and domestic conditions.

The same is true of international affairs—if we can break the deadlock in the current relations between our countries, especially between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, and start to develop mutually beneficial trade and improve international cultural, sports, and other ties, this will have a good impact on improving international relations and domestic conditions. Reducing armed forces and reducing military spending will create great possibilities for improving people's living standards. If we can break the current deadlock in international relations and change it in the direction of eliminating the "cold war", then this is already a remarkable thing. Of course, an agreement on complete disarmament will not be reached in the initial stage. However, I can foresee that the tendency of unilateral disarmament may strengthen, because when people see that the danger of war has disappeared, then countries with large armed forces will demand to reduce their armed forces in order to free up manpower and a large amount of material resources to develop their own economy, thereby demonstrating the superiority of this or that national system in the peaceful competition, in the competition to improve the living standards of their own people. This is a very good direction, because people do not need to bleed or be afraid. This is a matter of great concern to everyone and all mankind.

    赫鲁晓夫对“泰晤士报”国外部编辑说
    看来高级会议非举行不可
    应当从解决已成熟的问题入手逐步达到全面裁军
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫1月31日接见了英国“泰晤士报”国外部编辑麦克唐纳，并且同他谈了有关裁军、高级会议、中近东局势等重要国际问题和苏联国内的一些问题。
    苏联希望从根本上解决裁军问题，最终消灭军队。
    麦克唐纳提出的头一个问题是：苏联政府最近把禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题提出来作为高级会议讨论的第二个项目，希望达到怎样的结果？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们希望从根本上解决裁军问题。我们主张最终消灭军队而改为民警制度，就是说，在国内没有武装部队，而只有维持国内治安的民警部队。在十月革命以前时期和十月革命以后最初一段时间，我们党确实考虑到建立全民性的警察来代替常备军。丘吉尔先生倒给我们上了一课，因为他组织了对苏联的进攻。的确，英国和丘吉尔本人曾经起了很大的影响，使我国不得不建立自己强大的军队来保卫苏维埃国家免遭敌人的侵犯。但我想强调一下，常备军队的存在不是出于我们的信念，而是一定的局势所造成的。我们是国际主义者并且相信世界各国人民的友好合作。我们的目的不是战争，而是和平。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，如果说我们很重视我们的军队，那么，这是迫不得已的。既然资本主义国家没有军队就活不下去，那么我们也应该有军队。既要有军队，那么这支军队就要有能力抵抗任何威胁我们的势力。有人责难我们，说我们极力掌握一支强大的武装力量，好像是想借助它们把自己的意志强加于其他国家，他们责难我们，说我们想把自己的意识形态强加于其他国家。在这方面杜勒斯先生可以说是登峰造极了。但这是无稽之谈。我想，就连杜勒斯先生本人也不相信他所说的话。如果他还继续这么说，那无非是为了达到宣传目的，借此激起对苏联的仇恨。
    共产主义在全世界取得胜利，并不需要武装力量。
    有时，有人引证我的言论，说我表示相信我们的事业、即共产主义事业在全世界的胜利。我们的敌人就根据这一点大放厥词，说苏联保持一支强大的武装力量就是为了以武力达到自己的目的，即征服全世界。这也是胡说。
    如果我们说共产主义在全世界的胜利，那么这首先是指共产主义思想的必然胜利、马克思列宁主义哲学的胜利、各国按照马克思和列宁所发现的不依人们意志为转移的客观规律的发展。而为了取得反映社会发展的迫切要求的先进思想的胜利，并不需要武装力量，既不需要传统的武装，更不需要原子武装。如果一个学说是正确的并且反映社会发展的规律，那它就一定会掌握千百万人的心灵和意识，并且成为在争取新的、先进事物的斗争中的最伟大的力量。
    比如说，我们没有必要去教英国人进行革命，教他们在本国建立社会主义制度。当他们确信苏联和其他社会主义国家的现有制度比资本主义制度能给人民更多的好处，当他们确信在社会主义制度下有无限可能使人们能够更好地发挥自己的才能的时候，他们自己会做到这一点的。这就是我们的看法。
    赫鲁晓夫说，各国人民会自行解决社会发展问题。如果人民希望走社会主义道路，那我们只有欢迎和同情这种愿望，但如果他们不愿意这样做，而愿意在资本主义基础上保留陈旧的社会生活方式，那我们不会考虑把这点作为战争的理由；这也不可能成为各国人民发生冲突的理由。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，为了推动共产主义的思想，为了在人们的意识中传播和巩固这种思想，需要的不是军队，而是和平。的确，我们坚信我们思想必定胜利。但是将给这种思想带来胜利的并不是战争，而是人民在社会主义制度下更高的生活水平，是文化、科学、艺术的更高发展以及人类的生存而不是死亡所需要的一切的更高发展。任何氢弹、火箭要反对这点都是无能为力的；任何大西洋公约或者巴格达条约都不能阻挡科学的共产主义思想的传播，因为由于生活本身的逻辑，这种思想日益掌握人们的思想和心灵。
    我们对共产主义必然胜利的信心和信念就是基于这一点。所有的人一定会走向这个目标，至于说在什么时候，那是很难说的。这是一条漫长的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当世界上全体人民或很大一部分人民都走向共产主义的时候，在这些人民当中劳动和义务就会有某种分配。这不是竞争，而是同志式的合作，合理地分配力量，以便花费少而能生产更多的产品以满足社会、人们的生活消费。这就是我们的理想，这就是我们的目的。难道要达到这个目的需要国际战争吗？
    但是，西方国家统治集团由于仇恨我国，仇恨其他社会主义国家，仇恨我们共产主义思想，想消灭我们，所以我们不得不保存武装部队来保卫我国人民的成果。现在，当苏联已经不是孤独一国、团结了将近十亿人口的强大社会主义阵营日益壮大和巩固的时候，想用武力消灭社会主义国家的这种指望就是狂妄的指望。这完全是办不到的。
    正因为这样，我们要保留我国强大的武装部队，它们能挫折帝国主义狂人的气焰。
    赫鲁晓夫说，资本主义国家的某些政客指望强迫苏联处在更加尖锐的“冷战”环境中，从而使苏联在军备方面消耗更多的资金，以削弱我国的经济能力和妨碍它沿着和平的方向发展。然而，尽管他们实行“冷战”政策，我国的经济发展速度仍然大大地超过、并且将继续超过一切资本主义国家。事实雄辩地说明了这一点。我们赶过最先进的资本主义国家并在按人口平均的产量方面赶过它们的日子已经不远了。到那时候每个人将会更清楚地看到社会主义制度的无可争辩的优越性。
    因此，苏联根据现实条件和未来的前景，对军备竞赛和保持“冷战”政策是没有丝毫兴趣的。我们主张消除“冷战”政策，主张同一切国家建立最真诚和友好的关系，主张全面裁军和消灭武装力量。但是显然，我们的对方目前不准备这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在政治方面有时要遵循逐步过渡的规则，分几个阶段来解决问题。起初，可以先解决不复杂的已经成熟的问题，而后，当国际间更加信任的条件已经具备时，可以过渡到下一阶段，逐步达到全面裁军，建立各国之间的友好关系。我们主张全面彻底地解决裁军问题，但是我们晓得，我们的对方显然不准备这样做。虽然我们主张建立友好关系，但是同时也懂得不能单凭一句话。我们不完全相信我们西方伙伴，他们也不完全相信我们。让我们相处看看，让我们更经常地互相交往，发展贸易，从而证明我们不是“吃人精”，我们吃的东西同我们伙伴吃的东西一样。
    我之所以要说这么多的话来回答头一个问题，是因为我认为这是其他问题的出发点。
    当停止核试验达成协议时，苏联也准备接受监督。
    麦克唐纳提出的第二个问题是关于停止试验核武器的监督问题。他问赫鲁晓夫是否认为进行核弹或其他爆炸装置的试验可以不被远方获悉。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我认为不可能，因为爆炸总是可以被发现的。当停止试验核武器达成协议时，如果其他国家认为需要建立监督，我们也准备接受这一点。必须在我国和其他国家的境内合理地布置监督岗，以使这样一些人无所借口，这些人不愿消除“冷战”并硬说我们为了继续秘密试验核武器而反对建立监督。
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥了美国人所谓“干净”氢弹的说法。他说，这种议论无助于裁军和消灭“冷战”，而是为了继续执行“实力地位”政策。美国、英国和其他国家的正直科学家驳倒了制造“干净”氢弹的可能性。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中提到，载着已经装备好了的氢弹的飞机在和平城市的上空飞来飞去真是一件可怕的事。同装备氢弹的轰炸机在英国上空飞行这件事有联系的政策，可以称之为愚蠢的政策。
    必须寻求可以避免高级会议流产的方式来准备高级会议。
    麦克唐纳提出的第三个问题是：苏联政府是否倾向于同意使高级会议不在苏联所建议的“最近两三月内”举行，而推迟若干时日举行，如果这样使会议更有可能举行的话？
    赫鲁晓夫说，最近两三个月，这是我们假定的。只要有好处，日期可以推迟。谈到这里，我想起这样一桩事：年青时我是个钳工，那时厂主付给工资是不定时的，有时两三个月付一次。我记得，有一个矿井曾经贴了这样一个布告：“工资将在月底发”，但是没有说明哪一年，哪一月。我们也有点耽心，怕高级会议也被确定在
  “月底”，而不指明哪一月哪一年。
    麦克唐纳接着问赫鲁晓夫，如果外交部长会议只限于准备高级会议，您是否仍然反对召开外交部长会议呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我个人从来也不反对要对高级会议进行很好的准备。外交部长的存在就是为了处理国际问题，这一点原本是合乎逻辑的。然而，如果您有一个小孩，您自然希望有个好的保姆来照顾。您要选择能够保障您的小孩安全的保姆。假如您是一个喜欢花的人，并且雇一个园丁来种花，您自然要设法找到一个不仅在这方面很能干、很内行，而且也珍惜地培植和爱护这些花的园丁。遗憾的是，在外交部长当中还有那种使人耽心花的命运的“园丁”和使人耽心小孩命运的“保姆”。换句话说，我们耽心高级会议在胚胎中就遭到夭亡。那时我们得到的将不是婴儿，而是流产。这就是我们所耽心的。必须寻求一种可以避免这种后果的方式来准备高级会议。也可能，需要通过外交的途径来准备这次会议。
    麦克唐纳在谈话中表示，在高级会议以后，外交部长也同样必须开会来完成政府首脑所制定的决议。可见，即使在高级会议以后，成果也还会遭到破坏。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这完全可能。就是在高级会谈之后，已达成的决议也可能遭到破坏。我们希望，高级会谈能够成为那种使国际关系摆脱当前状态的力量，因为这会给达成积极的决议以更多的希望。在高级会议后，部长们可以继续工作，但是那时他们将更难进行阻挠，他们将不得不考虑舆论。
    如果各国人民得出结论：必须消除“冷战”，那么任何力量也不能阻碍这个，解决问题的办法终归一定会找到。反对消除“冷战”的人非常清楚这点，因此他们害怕政府首脑会谈，害怕在高级会议上达成积极成果。要知道，公众在获得头几个积极成果后，将会施加更强烈的压力，争取使国际关系继续不断地改善。和平的敌人不顾事实，总是把苏联描绘成一种邪恶的力量，说苏联不守信用，不可信赖等等。但是各国人民已经听厌了这种话，他们开始不理会这种话。看来，高级会谈非举行不可。
    在中欧建立无原子区的计划，是实现全面裁军的步骤之一。
    麦克唐纳提出，是否可以把中欧无原子区的计划同缩减这个地区的常规军队的协定结合在一起？
    赫鲁晓夫说，这里所打算解决的并不是范围很窄的问题，而是更为广泛的问题。我们坚持全面裁军的立场，第一个阶段我们在这方面前进的越远，达到最终目标也就越容易。我们愿意完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，全面裁军，完全撤出驻在别国境内的外国军队和消除在别国境内的外国基地。我们知道我们的对方不愿意这样解决问题，因此我们建议逐步地、分阶段地解决问题，建议不是从裁军问题的根本解决开始，而是从裁军问题的逐步解决开始。这样就可以一步一步地达到主要的目标，也就是达到全面裁军问题的解决。
    如果大国不干涉的话，阿拉伯国家和以色列可以更快地改善关系。
    麦克唐纳接着问赫鲁晓夫是否认为，各方面暂缓一二年供给中东地区武器以作为缓和紧张局势的一个先决步骤可能比较有好处呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说，这是一条明智的道路。我们在伦敦的时候曾经说过，双方停止供应中近东地区武器是合宜的。显然，不仅应该缓期供给中近东地区武器，而且应该就不干涉它们的事务这点达成协议，使它们的主权和独立得到承认。这一切应该做到这样：应该使阿拉伯国家人民不致认为我们宣布缓期是要他们手无寸铁，从而为其他国家的侵略势力干涉阿拉伯国家内政或者为所欲为地进犯它们和剥夺它们的独立提供机会。这是一种不好的和有害的做法。必须料到这一点并消除这种现象。如果我们简单地宣布缓期，那末阿拉伯人就会认为，苏联改变了自己的政策，放弃了我们已经宣布的并且在严格执行的原则。我们的原则起源于联合国宪章：我们维护阿拉伯国家的主权和独立，主张其他国家不干涉这些国家的内政等等。
    在谈到阿拉伯国家和以色列的关系时，赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，如果大国不干涉的话，那么阿拉伯国家和以色列自己可以更快地取得互相了解，就它们之间的相互关系达成协议。这就会有助于这一地区达到安宁和有助于寻求消灭那里紧张局势的可能性。如果现在采取某种外来干涉，就未必会有什么好处，因为那里相互之间的关系非常尖锐。看来，以色列国家领导人应当更好地考虑一下当前的具体情况，考虑阿拉伯世界的利益。目前以色列对这种利益往往不仅不考虑，而且还公然加以藐视，对阿拉伯国家采取挑衅的态度。
    为了最合理地利用苏联的物质资源和其他资源，党的作用就不断增长。
    麦克唐纳请赫鲁晓夫解释一下应当如何理解苏联共产党中央委员会日益增长的作用，任命很多党的书记是否表明共产党中央委员会的作用日益增长。
    赫鲁晓夫说，您对这个问题的理解很正确。是的，您所说的变化表明了共产党在我国生活中的作用日益增长，显然这种作用今后将更加增长。现在我们这里，区、州和共和国之间以前那些行政联系的形式和方法有某些削弱。同时，州和共和国之间的思想上的联系有了加强和巩固，苏联人民的团结有了进一步巩固。在这方面，共产党起着决定性的作用，党的作用在加强。我国人民是一个统一的友好的家庭，结成这个家庭的因素是：他们的政治观点是一致的，政治目的是一致的，切身利益是相同的。每一个苏维埃共和国都是根据苏联所面临的总任务，考虑自己的特点来解决自己面临的任务。我们认为，解决经济和行政问题是每一个共和国、每一个民族的内部事务。
    我国各族人民之间的相互关系是不断发展的。国家的各种职能也在发生变化。当我国创造出过渡到共产主义社会的条件时，国家行政管理的很多机构就要逐渐消亡。军队、法庭、检察院和其他机构都要灭亡。看样子，法庭将要比军队和其他行政机构存在得更久一些。也可能，法庭还会继续存在，当然需要有所改变。要知道人们之间还会发生各种纠纷，应当有一种仲裁机构来解决这些纠纷。
    我不打算推测我们社会在更遥远时期的变化，然而现在我们社会生活已经在依据马克思列宁主义原理的方向发展着。在这种情况下，为了最合理地利用我们现有的物质资源和其他资源，党的作用就不断增长。党比国家机构具有更有力的基础。党的产生和存在并不是由于某些立法性的义务的结果。党的发展是导源于人们的政治观点，即导源于精神因素状态的那些情况所促成的。而人类对于精神因素则是永远需要的。
    由于改组了工业和建设的管理，苏联工农业现况比过去好得多。
    麦克唐纳最后问赫鲁晓夫对改组工业和建设管理的计划执行情况是否感到满意。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不仅仅是满意，我简直高兴极了。这甚至超出了我们一切最大胆的期望和预测。由于改组了工业和建设的管理，我们的力量增长了好多，国内的工业、农业的状况现在比过去好得多了。而现在，当我们进行改组机器拖拉机站的工作的时候，我们将保证更好地刺激我们的经济、特别是农业的发展。
    所有这一切现象是很容易说明的。从前我们主要是用行政因素领导工业企业和农业的工作。而党、工会和共青团的力量却没有充分发挥他们所能发挥的积极性。现在，在分散管理工业的情况下，工业和建设的领导都转到地方，更接近于企业和工地。因此，党、工会和共青团组织对企业工作的影响力量空前地提高了。这些组织更积极和主动了，他们对完成计划的责任感增加了。而且计划本身也是在本企业必须参加的情况下制定的。在这个题目上还可以讲许多。但如果简单点说，那就应当强调指出，由于实施了改组工业和建设的管理的措施，我们收到了极好的效果。从位于莫斯科的一个中心，一个部长领导国内的全部工业，当然是很困难的。那时，部长应当比上帝还站得高，因为他得知道和看到比如库页岛、堪察加、巴库或亚美尼亚都在做些什么。而这却是不可思议的事情。现在我们把解决企业工作中的一切问题的权力转给了地方，这只能使工作受到好处。
    麦克唐纳接着说，贵国在农业方面的改进的确是巨大的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，可是还要有更大的改进。1953年9月，我们在农业方面实现了某些措施以后，克服了停滞的现象。后来，我们又修改了几项法律，为发展农业创造了更好的条件，于是农业便开始迅速地发展、鼓起劲头来了。
    如果能够打破各国僵局，对改善国际关系和国内状况都会有好影响。
    国际事务也是如此——如果我们能够打破我们各国之间、而首先是苏、美、英、法和其他国家之间当前关系的僵局，开始发展互利的贸易，改善国际文化、体育和其他联系，这对改善国际关系和国内状况都会产生良好的影响。裁减武装部队和减少军费开支会创造很大的可能来提高人民生活水平。假如我们能打破目前国际关系的僵局，使它朝着消除“冷战”的方向改变，那么这已经是一件了不起的大事了。当然，最初阶段不会达成关于全面裁军的协议。但是，我可以预料，单方面裁军的倾向可能加强，因为当人们看到，战争的危险已经消失，那末拥有大批武装部队的国家就要求裁减本国的武装部队，以便腾出人力和大量的物力来发展本国经济，从而表明这种或那种国家制度在和平竞赛、在提高本国人民生活水平的竞赛当中的优越性。这是一个很好的方向，因为人们不需要流血，也不必恐惧。这是每个人和全人类极为关心的事。
