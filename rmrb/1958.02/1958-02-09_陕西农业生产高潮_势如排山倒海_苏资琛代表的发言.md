I fully agree with all the reports presented at the conference and am confident and willing to work hard to realize them! We also believe that these reports will greatly inspire the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, who will use an overwhelming revolutionary drive to achieve astonishing results in the wave of the great leap forward in production.

From the sandy hills of northern Shaanxi to the rugged Qinling Mountains – Astonishing examples of high-yield harvests are constantly emerging

Shaanxi Province has more than 17.8 million hardworking and brave people and more than 67 million mu of cultivated land, of which more than 48 percent is mountainous, with very low yields. However, since the socialist revolution changed the ownership of the means of production, liberating productive forces, and especially since the study of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Draft) and socialist ideological education, the peasants have been greatly encouraged and have done many amazing things, with unprecedented increases in crop yields. Even in the sandy hills of northern Shaanxi and the rugged Qinling and Bashan Mountains in southern Shaanxi, many examples of high-yield harvests have emerged, which have further boosted our confidence and drive to complete the various indicators of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule and exceeding targets, especially the grain targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin per mu, and the cotton targets of 40, 60, 80, and 100 jin per mu. For example, the Nanba Cooperative in Xixiang County, located in the Bashan mountain area, has a sandy field where the water source relies only on rainwater accumulated in ponds, yet the rice yield reached 1,650 jin per mu; some agricultural cooperatives in Shangxian and Luonan counties have wheat yields of 1,150 jin per mu and corn yields of more than 1,958 jin per mu. The sweet potato yield on sloping land in cooperatives in Baihe and Lan'gao counties reached 13,920 jin per mu. Northern Shaanxi is a sandy, high-altitude, cold, and arid mountainous area. For many years, the average grain yield per mu was only 20 to 30 jin. However, now the paddy field in the Houqinghe Cooperative in Yijun County has a yield of 1,654 jin per mu, and the cornfield in the Baimatan Cooperative in Huanglong County has a yield of more than 1,956 jin per mu. In addition, agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Yan'an, Ganquan, and Zizhou have millet yields of 1,035 jin per mu, broomcorn millet yields of more than 1,143 jin per mu, and sorghum yields of 1,010 jin per mu. In the Guanzhong Plain area, some dry land wheat yields in the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative and the Lijia Gou Cooperative in Chengcheng County have increased from the original 100 jin to 1,203.4 jin to 1,265 jin. Some paddy field wheat yields in the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County have reached 1,198.5 jin per mu. The per mu yield of ginned cotton in the paddy fields of the Zhichuan Agricultural Cooperative in Hancheng County and the Bali Dian Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County has increased from the original 30 jin to 347.6 jin to 393.9 jin. The per mu yield of ginned cotton in the dry land cotton fields of the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Qianxian County has increased from the original 10 jin to 152 jin. The per mu yield of spring-sown corn in the Zao Ping Agricultural Cooperative in Chunhua County in the Guanzhong mountain area reached 2,294 jin. Large-scale high yields have already been achieved in four counties (cities) including Chang'an, Gaoling, Xianyang, and Xi'an, and twenty-three counties (cities) including Wugong and Xianyang, where the average grain yield per mu of twenty-six townships and four hundred and seventy agricultural cooperatives has reached more than 400 jin, completing the grain yield targets of the National Programme for Agricultural Development ten years ahead of schedule; in six counties (cities) including Nanzheng and Baocheng in southern Shaanxi, five townships and one hundred and twenty-five agricultural cooperatives have already surpassed the Yangtze River in grain yield, with an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu; especially in Hougou, Guidebao, Yulin, along the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi, where 432 mu of cultivated land has achieved an average grain yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. As for cotton, fourteen counties (cities) including Dali, Weinan, and Fuping have more than 2 million mu with an average yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Four cities and counties, including Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling, and Xi'an, have an average yield of more than 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The Jinghui Irrigation Area, with 400,000 mu, has an average yield of more than 95 jin of ginned cotton per mu, already reaching the 80-jin target in the National Programme for Agricultural Development. These many examples demonstrate that we can complete and exceed the various indicators in the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule.

The masses in Dali put forward a heroic slogan: Work hard for five years to cross the Huai River, and fight continuously for ten years to cross the Yangtze River.

Thanks to the correct leadership and support of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, our relatively good land and climate, our long-standing farming experience and new technologies, our increasing water conservancy and fertilizers, and the support of our rapidly developing industry for agriculture, especially since the rectification campaign in rural areas and the great debate between the two roads, the determination of the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road has been strengthened, greatly encouraging their high socialist labor enthusiasm and overwhelming drive. For example, the masses in Dali have already put forward the heroic slogan in agricultural production: "Work hard for five years to cross the Huai River, and fight continuously for ten years to cross the Yangtze River." The people in the Yulin area are currently overcoming the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius to build water conservancy projects, truly "thousands of miles of ice, enthusiasm boiling"; the masses in Jingbian put forward the slogan "The cold weather and frozen ground do not stop work, and the confidence in increasing production is harder than iron," and are now working hard to build water conservancy projects in the desert, and have already completed and exceeded the planned tasks by more than three times. This drive of the broad masses of peasants will greatly promote the leap forward in agricultural production. For example, from October to December last year, the rectification campaign greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the peasant masses. In just three months, more than 3.89 million mu of paddy fields were built, which is 300,000 mu more than the paddy fields built in the two thousand years before liberation. Soil and water conservation is also being carried out with great enthusiasm. Many agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi are building terraced fields on stone mountains, carrying soil to pave on the stones to grow crops, and building ponds to store rainwater for irrigation. These are all creating conditions for completing and exceeding the targets of the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule.

Any place can become an advanced area – The key lies in mobilizing the great power of the masses

Of course, it is not without difficulties for us to complete and exceed the grain and cotton targets and other targets of the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. We need to bring out our revolutionary drive, try every means to find solutions, give full play to the high labor enthusiasm of the masses, and encourage the masses to fully exert their conscious initiative and creativity to overcome all difficulties. This is the vitality of socialism. We have no reason to say that what advanced places can do, other places cannot do; nor can we say that what areas with poor conditions can do, areas with good conditions cannot do. "Everything depends on human effort." There are no insurmountable difficulties and nothing that cannot be done. For example, in order to make the river water flow through the hillside to irrigate the fields, the Yaozewa Agricultural Cooperative in Shenmu County chiseled a 20-zhang long stone cave in the hillside with a hammer and drill, finally changing the course of a small river to flow westward, leading it to the sandbank more than two zhang high, building more than 520 mu of paddy fields, and making the average grain yield reach 350 jin per mu, with nine mu of experimental fields reaching 785 jin per mu.

In addition to building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, improving soil, improving seeds, farm tools, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and continuously improving farming techniques, etc., to achieve the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, it is also particularly important to continuously fight against right-leaning conservative thinking. In the past, many of our achievements were obtained by overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking: From the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956, we criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and completed agricultural cooperativization and the full public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce. Last year, in conjunction with the rectification campaign, we criticized right-leaning conservative thinking again, and our grain requisition, drought resistance, wheat sowing, and water conservancy construction have also made unprecedented and rapid progress. Right-leaning conservative thinking is a major obstacle to our promotion of the great leap forward in production. Because it does not see the great power of the masses; on the contrary, only the great power of the masses can completely break right-leaning conservative thinking. We must fully rely on the masses and greatly give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, which is the fundamental guarantee for our great leap forward in agricultural production.

Increased harvests year after year – The masses have great confidence – We must break through this year's agricultural production plan

The 1958 agricultural production plan that is currently being formulated in our province aims for a total grain output of 11.5 billion jin, striving to reach 12.5 billion jin, an increase of 3.5 billion jin over 1957 and 1.7 billion jin over the unprecedented bumper harvest of 1956. The total cotton output is 2.35 million dan, striving to reach 2.5 million dan, an increase of 580,000 dan over 1956 and 290,000 dan over the unprecedented bumper harvest of 1957. Such continuous growth will fill everyone with confidence and hope for our great future, and will even more strongly exert their infinite power. We can also see their incomparable joy from the songs of praise of the broad masses. They say: "The world is changing strangely, corn yields 2,200, always listen to the Party's words, and production grows really fast!" They also say: "The cooperatives are beating gongs and drums, singing praises of cooperation, engaging in fertilizer accumulation, and building dams, teaching water to climb up the original; the harvests grow longer every year, and grain and cotton are as beautiful as mountains! The facts before our eyes will speak, and we believe that the power of socialism is great, and we will not forget the grain growers when we eat rice. The Communist Party is our own parents!" These words are full of boundless enthusiasm and great power. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the more than 17 million peasant masses in our province are rejoicing and confidently striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production and completing and exceeding the various indicators in the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule!

　　陕西农业生产高潮  势如排山倒海
    苏资琛代表的发言
    我完全同意大会各项报告，并信心百倍地愿为其实现而努力！我们更相信这些报告，将大大激发亿万人民的心情，以排山倒海的革命干劲，在生产大跃进的浪潮中，做出骇人成绩。
　　风沙丘陵的陕北和山骨嶙峋的秦岭  高额丰产的惊人事例纷纷传来
    陕西省有一千七百八十多万勤劳勇敢的人民，有六千七百多万亩耕地，其中百分之四十八以上是山区，产量很低。但自社会主义革命改变了生产资料所有制，解放了生产力，尤其是农业发展纲要（草案）的学习和社会主义的思想教育以来，大大的鼓舞了农民，做出许多惊人事迹，农作物产量空前增长着。就是在陕北的风沙丘陵地带和陕南的石骨嶙峋秦岭、巴山之间，都涌出了不少的高额丰产事例，这些事例，更鼓舞了我们的信心和干劲，能提前和超额完成农业发展纲要（修正草案）的各项指标，特别是粮食四、五、八指标和棉花四、六、八、一百指标。如西乡县南坝社在巴山山区，有块沙土地，水源只靠陂塘积蓄的雨水，水稻却亩产一千六百五十斤，商县、雒南等县的农业社有的小麦亩产一千一百五十斤，玉米亩产一千九百五十八斤多。白河、岚皋等县的社有山坡地的红薯亩产达一万三千九百二十斤。陕北是风沙高寒亢旱山区，过去多少年粮食亩产量平均不过二、三十斤，可是现在宜君县后清河社水稻丰产田，亩产达一千六百五十四斤，黄龙县白麻滩社玉米丰产地亩产达一千九百五十六斤多，还有延安、甘泉、子洲等县农业社的有谷子亩产一千零三十五斤，糜子亩产一千一百四十三斤多，高梁亩产一千零一十斤。关中平原区澄城县红旗农业社和李家沟社的旱地小麦有的亩产量已由原来的一百斤左右，提高到一千二百零三点四斤至一千二百六十五斤。渭南县和平农业社水地回茬小麦有的亩产达一千一百九十八点五斤。韩城县芝川农业社和渭南县八里店农业社水地棉花亩产皮棉已由原来的三十斤左右提高到三百四十七点六斤至三百九十三点九斤。乾县红星农业社旱地棉花亩产皮棉已由原来的十多斤提高到一百五十二斤。关中山区淳化县的棗萍农业社春播玉米亩产达二千二百九十四斤。大面积丰产已有长安、高陵、咸阳、西安等四个县（市）和武功、咸阳等二十三个县（市）的二十六个乡和四百七十个农业社的粮食平均亩产量已达四百斤以上，提前十年完成了农业发展纲要粮食产量指标；陕南的南郑、褒城等六个县（市）有五个乡和一百二十五个农业社的粮食产量已经跨过长江，平均亩产达到八百斤以上；尤其陕北长城沿线榆林归德堡后沟有四百三十二亩耕地，粮食亩产平均达到一千斤以上。至于棉花有大荔、渭南、富平等十四个县（市）二百多万亩平均亩产皮棉达一百斤以上。泾阳、三原、高陵、西安市等四个市县平均亩产皮棉达八十斤以上，泾惠灌区四十万亩平均亩产皮棉九十五斤以上，已经达到农业发展纲要中八十斤的指标。这许多事例正表明我们能够提前、超额完成农业发展纲要中的各种指标。
    大荔群众提出英雄口号  苦干五载跨淮河连战十年过长江
    由于我们有中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导和支援，我们有比较良好的土地和气候，我们有悠久的耕作经验和新的技术，我们有愈来愈多的水利和肥料，我们有发展惊人的工业对农业的支持，特别是农村开展整风以来，经过两条道路的大辩论，更坚定了广大农民群众走社会主义道路的决心，大大鼓舞了他们高度的社会主义劳动热情和排山倒海的干劲。例如大荔群众在农业生产上已经提出了“苦干五载跨淮河，连战十年过长江”的英雄口号；榆林专区人民，目前已战胜零下二十多度的严寒兴修水利，真是“千里冰封，干劲沸腾”；靖边群众提出“天寒地冻工不停，增产信心比铁硬”的口号，现正热汗腾腾的在沙漠地里修水利，并已提前和超额完成计划任务的三倍以上。广大农民群众的这种干劲，将会大大促进农业生产的向前跃进。例如去年十至十二月，由于整风运动大大激发了农民群众的劳动热情，短短的三个月期间，就修成水地三百八十九万多亩，比解放前两千多年修成的水地还多三十万亩，还有水土保持也是热火朝天的干着。陕南山区许多农业社都在石山上修梯田，担土铺在石头上种庄稼，修陂塘蓄雨水来灌溉。这些都是为提前和超额完成农业发展纲要的指标创造条件。
    任何地方都能成为先进地区  关键在于发动群众巨大力量
    当然，我们要提前和超额完成农业发展纲要的粮、棉指标和其他指标并不是没有困难，而是要我们拿出革命的干劲，千方百计的想办法，发挥群众高度的劳动热情，鼓励群众充分发挥其自觉的积极性和创造性战胜一切困难，这就是社会主义的生命力。我们没有理由说，先进地方能办到的事，其他的地方就办不到；更不能说条件不好的地区能办到，而条件好的地区反办不到。总是“事在人为”，就没有克服不了的困难，没有办不到的事情。例如神木县窑则洼农业社，为了使河水穿过山腰灌溉田地，一锤一钻地在山腰中凿成了一条二十丈长的石洞，终于把条小河改道西流，引上两丈多高的沙滩，修成五百二十多亩水地，使粮食平均亩产达到三百五十斤，内有九亩试验田亩产已达七百八十五斤。
    提前实现农业发展纲要，除了兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤、改良籽种、农具、防治病虫和不断改进耕作技术等等外，还特别要不断地与右倾保守思想作斗争。过去我们许多成绩都是在克服右倾保守思想的情况下获得的：一九五五年下半年到一九五六年上半年，我们批判了右倾保守思想，就完成了农业合作化和资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营，去年下半年结合整风，又批判了右倾保守思想，我们的征粮、抗旱种麦、兴修水利等工作也获得了空前的迅速进展。右倾保守思想是我们促进生产大跃进的大障碍。因为它看不见群众的巨大力量；恰恰相反，只有群众的巨大力量才能彻底打破右倾保守思想。我们要充分依靠群众，大大发挥群众的积极性和创造性，这就是我们农业生产大跃进的根本保证。
    年年收成增加　群众信心很大  一定要突破今年农业生产计划
    现在我省正酝酿的一九五八年农业生产计划，粮食总产量为一百一十五亿斤，争取达到一百二十五亿斤，比一九五七年增三十五亿斤，比一九五六年空前大丰收增十七亿斤。棉花总产量为二百三十五万担，争取达到二百五十万担，比一九五六年增五十八万担，比一九五七年空前大丰收增二十九万担。这样不断的增长，就会使每个人对我们的伟大未来充满信心，充满希望，也就会更坚强的发挥他们无穷无尽的力量。我们只从广大群众的歌颂声中也可以看出他们的无可比拟的喜悦心情。他们说：“世事翻新真奇怪，玉米打了二千二，永远只听党的话，产量真个长的快！”又说：“社社锣鼓乱敲打，声声歌唱合作化，搞积肥，修水坝，教水只往原上爬；年年收成只管长，粮、棉如山美札啦！眼前实事会说话，才信社会主义力量大，吃米不忘种谷人，共产党就是咱的亲爹妈！”这些词句里正充满无限的热情和巨力，我省一千七百多万农民群众，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，正万分欢欣鼓舞的、满怀信心的为农业生产大跃进，提前、超额实现农业发展纲要中的各项指标而奋斗！
    不当之处，请批评指正。
