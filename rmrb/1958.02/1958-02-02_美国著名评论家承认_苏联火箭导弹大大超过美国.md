Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 28th dispatch from TASS: The American "Saturday Evening Post" published an article by the famous commentator Stewart Alsop. In discussing how to eliminate the gap between the Soviet Union and the United States in the manufacture of intercontinental ballistic weapons, he pointed out: "It is impossible to seek any miraculous 'breakthrough' to make up for the time we have lost. The Soviet Union has far surpassed us in the manufacture of rockets and missiles."

The author believes that the successful launch of two Soviet artificial earth satellites means that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in the manufacture of strategic-range ballistic rockets. This is because:

First, in the manufacture of medium-range ballistic rockets, the ratio between the United States and the Soviet Union is "hundreds to zero." He believes that the American "Jupiter" and "Thor" rockets "will not become weapons for at least a year (perhaps even longer)."

Second, the United States is also behind the Soviet Union in the manufacture of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The author specifically pointed out that the Soviet "rockets are multi-stage," while the American "Atlas" rocket, which has not been successfully tested, "is only a single-stage large rocket." Alsop believes, "It will take three, maybe five years, for us to make intercontinental ballistic rockets for combat."

Third, in the manufacture of rocket engines, the author believes that the fact that the United States was defeated by the Soviet Union in the launch of artificial satellites is sufficient to clearly prove the United States' backwardness in this regard.

### 美国著名评论家承认  苏联火箭导弹大大超过美国

　　美国著名评论家承认
    苏联火箭导弹大大超过美国
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：美国“星期六晚邮报”刊载著名的评论员斯图尔特·艾尔索普的一篇文章，他在谈到如何消灭苏联和美国在制造洲际弹道武器方面的距离时指出：“不可能求得任何奇迹的‘突进’来弥补我们丧失的时间。苏联在制造火箭导弹方面远远地超过了我们”。
    作者认为，两颗苏联人造地球卫星的发射成功，意味着苏联在制造战略射程的弹道火箭方面大大超过了美国。这是由于：
    第一，在制造中程弹道火箭方面，美国同苏联的比数是“数百比零”，他认为美国的“丘辟特”式和“雷神”式火箭“至少在一年之内（也许时间还更长些）不能成为武器。”
    第二，是在制造洲际弹道导弹方面，美国也落后于苏联。作者特别指出，苏联的“火箭是多节的”，而美国所没有试验成功的“阿特拉斯”火箭“只不过是单级大火箭”。艾尔索普认为，“要经过三年，也许是五年，我们才能制成战斗用的洲际弹道火箭”。
    第三，在制造火箭发动机方面，作者认为，在发射人造卫星这件事上美国被苏联击败的情形，就足以明显地证明美国在这方面的落后。
