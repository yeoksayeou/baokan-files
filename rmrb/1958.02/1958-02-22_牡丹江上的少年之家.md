    The Children's Home on the Mudanjiang River
    By Our Correspondent Miáo Fēng
    One sunny afternoon, I walked into the Mudanjiang "Children's Home." There were many children here, some buried in books and newspapers, some playing table tennis and basketball, some blowing bugles, playing the huqin, banging gongs, drumming, rehearsing songs and dances, and puppet shows, and some pruning apple trees in the botanical garden.
    Since its establishment in October 1954, the Mudanjiang "Children's Home" has organized and helped more than 3,500 middle and primary school graduates study on their own. Among them, more than 450 have been promoted to higher schools through self-study, and more than 1,700 have entered industrial and agricultural production and are employed in various industries. There are still more than 1,300 people, distributed in more than 230 groups, studying with peace of mind. How do they study on their own? Are they learning well?
    Self-study time is from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. I visited many groups set up on kangs (heated brick beds) in various homes, including Han Chinese groups and Korean groups. Except that the houses vary in size, brightness, and the number of group members (five to seven), the layout and learning methods of the groups are basically the same. The walls are covered with study schedules, timetables, duty rosters, study covenants, criticism and praise bulletin boards, roll call books, and scorebooks. For each subject, each group has a subject representative (a "little teacher"), who is an outstanding student in that subject selected by the group. They attend two lessons a week at the Children's Home and then pass on the knowledge to the group. Each group has a group leader, also elected by everyone, who organizes and leads the study under the guidance of the teacher and presides over the weekly review meeting. The review covers study, unity, labor, punctuality, and the leave system. There are those who are praised and those who are criticized.
    When I arrived at Yáo Yùjié's group, the sixteen-year-old Chinese language representative, Mǎ Fènglán, was standing by the blackboard, asking the five students sitting around the kang table: "What is the main idea of 'Honest Words'? Who is the author? What other works does he have?" Everyone lowered their heads but raised their hands. Raising your hand before speaking and not making noise are clearly written in the covenant. Mǎ Fènglán appointed Liú Wànfù to answer and reminded him not to bite his nails anymore. Liú Wànfù is the only boy in this group, the youngest, only thirteen years old. He often likes to gnaw on his thumb like a puppy gnawing on a bone. At this time, he put his hand down obediently and answered the question. Afterwards, everyone successively raised different opinions and supplements, and finally, the subject representative summarized them. Each group felt that this method of questioning and discussion was good, inspiring each other and making it easier to remember. Students who did not study hard also slowly became interested in learning.
    From the very beginning, the Children's Home paid attention to labor education. In addition to explaining the glory of labor on ordinary days, the teachers often called on the children to participate in social labor and housework. They are model units for participating in social labor in the city. Many groups also often help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers by carrying water, chopping firewood, and sweeping the courtyard, and helping the government register households, eliminate illiteracy, and read newspapers to the masses. They have also cultivated a botanical garden of more than two mu (a Chinese unit of area), planted more than 100 fruit trees, and built a small greenhouse for cultivating various vegetable seedlings and flowers. Recently, they bought three piglets, which everyone takes turns feeding, and built three small pig sheds.
    Because the Children's Home paid attention to the labor education of children, most of the children understood the glory of labor from the bottom of their hearts. When the Mudanjiang Youth Collective Farm organized people to reclaim wasteland in Mishan County, more than 150 people signed up.
    The children used to gather in groups, playing marbles, kicking footballs, and fighting in the streets, hindering traffic. Not only were they often injured and scratched, but they also committed many pranks. The loss of goods in shops, the loss of books in bookstores, and the loss of money by pedestrians occurred from time to time. After the establishment of the "Children's Home," this situation has greatly reduced.
    Does it require a lot of state funding and increase the burden on parents to run such a "Children's Home"? No, not at all.
    The Mudanjiang "Children's Home" was established in this way. The Mudanjiang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of relevant personnel from various organs and organizations and decided that the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League should be responsible for the specific organization and leadership work. The Municipal People's Committee allocated a room for training "little teachers" and a reading room, paid the salaries of seven teachers, and various organs and organizations donated several thousand books and more than 30 musical instruments. The Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League subsidized 20 yuan per month for books and newspapers. Parents only had to pay 5 jiao (a Chinese unit of currency) per quarter for miscellaneous expenses. That was all, but it solved a problem that everyone was concerned about very well.
    After visiting the Mudanjiang Children's Home, I thought that it might not be difficult to run such a "Children's Home" that is supported by everyone and does not cost much money in various cities of our country! Let the "Red Peonies" like those on the Mudanjiang River bloom even redder and brighter all over the country.

### 牡丹江上的少年之家

    牡丹江上的少年之家
    本报记者　苗风
    一个晴朗的下午，我走进了牡丹江“少年之家”。这里有许多孩子，有的埋头在书报里，有的打乒乓球、篮球，有的吹大号、拉胡琴、敲锣、打鼓、排练歌舞和木偶戏，还有的在植物园里修剪苹果树的枝芽。
    牡丹江“少年之家”从1954年10月建立以来，已经组织和帮助了三千五百多中、小学毕业生自学，其中，有四百五十多名经过自学升学，一千七百多名投入工、农业生产，和在各行各业就业。现在还有一千三百多人，分布在二百三十多个小组安心学习。他们是怎么自学的呢？学得好吗？
    上午八点至十一点是自学时间。我参观了设在各家炕头上的许多小组，有汉族组、也有朝鲜族组。各组除房子有大有小，有亮有暗，组员五至七人不等外，小组的布置和学习方法基本相同。墙上贴挂着学习时间表、课程表、值日表、学习公约、批评和表扬壁报、点名册、记分册。各门功课，各小组都有科代表（小先生），科代表是本组选出的某门功课的优秀生，每星期到少年之家听两次课，然后在小组传授。各小组都有小组长，也是大家选的，组长在老师指导下组织领导学习，主持每星期六的检讨会。检查学习、团结、劳动、遵守时间、请假制度等。有受表扬的，也有受批评的。
    我到姚玉洁小组的时候，十六岁的语文科代表马凤兰正站在黑板旁，向围坐在炕桌旁的五个同学提出：“老实话”的主题思想是什么？作者是谁？他还有什么著作？大家低着头，却举起手。发言先举手，不可喧哗，公约上已写得明白。马凤兰指定刘万富回答，并提醒他不要再啃指甲。刘万富是这个小组里唯一的男孩子，年龄最小，只十三岁。常常喜欢像小狗啃骨头一样啃大拇指。这时他规规矩矩放下手，回答问题。之后，大家依次提出不同意见和补充，最后科代表归纳起来。各小组都觉得这种提问、讨论的方法好，相互启发，容易记忆。不努力学习的学生，也慢慢对学习发生了兴趣。
    少年之家一开头，就注意了劳动教育，老师们除平时讲解劳动光荣的道理，还常常号召参加社会劳动和家务劳动。他们是全市参加社会劳动的模范单位。许多小组还经常帮助烈、军属抬水、砍柴、扫院，帮助政府登记户口、扫盲、给群众读报等。他们还开垦了二亩多地的植物园，栽了一百多棵果树，还有一个培育各种菜秧和花草的小温室，小温室是自己盖的。最近买了三只小猪，大家轮流喂养，又盖了三间小猪棚。
    由于少年之家注意了对儿童的劳动教育，绝大部分孩子都从思想深处懂得了劳动光荣的道理。在组织牡丹江青年集体农庄到密山县垦荒时，有一百五十多人报了名。
    孩子们，他们曾经成群结伙，在街道上弹琉璃球，踢足球，打架，妨碍交通，经常摔伤擦破，自不必说，且做出了许多恶作剧。商店丢货，书店丢书，行人丢钱的事，时有发生。“少年之家”成立之后，这种情况大大减少了。
    办这样一个“少年之家”，是否需要国家花很大的本钱和加重家长的负担呢？不，完全不需要。
    牡丹江“少年之家”是这样成立起来的。中国共产党牡丹江市委，召开了各机关团体有关人员的会议，决定由团市委负责具体组织领导工作，市人民委员会拨出一间训练小先生兼阅览室的房子，支出七个教员的薪水，各机关团体捐助了几千册书和三十多件乐器，团市委每月补助二十元书报费，家长每季只负担五角钱的杂支费。仅仅如此而已，却很好地解决了一个大家所关心的问题。
    访牡丹江少年之家后，我想，在我们祖国的各个城市里，办这样一个：大家支持、花钱不多的“少年之家”，也许并不困难吧！让像牡丹江上的“红牡丹”，在全国各地开得更红更鲜艳吧。
