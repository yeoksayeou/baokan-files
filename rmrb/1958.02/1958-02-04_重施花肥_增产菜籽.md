Current Problems That Should Be Paid Attention to in Agricultural and Vegetable Production

　　Heavy Application of Flower Fertilizer to Increase Rapeseed Production
    "Water seedlings for wheat, fertilize flowers for rapeseed," is a valuable experience accumulated by our laboring farmers over the years. Judging from the examples of high yields in various places, applying a heavy top dressing of fertilizer during the initial flowering period of rapeseed can generally increase production by 20% to 30%. The increase in production is even more significant when the base fertilizer is lacking. In a comparative experiment in the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Xupu County, Hunan Province, the fertilized area increased production by 26% compared to the unfertilized control area. The experimental results of the Yiyang Agricultural Experiment Station in Jiangxi Province showed that applying 10 dan of human and animal manure per mu during the initial flowering period of rapeseed increased production by 31% compared to the unfertilized control area.
    This year, the rapeseed in the main producing areas has grown well in the early stage, which has laid a good foundation for increasing rapeseed production. In order to further promote the increase of rapeseed production and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest, it is necessary to pay special attention to this important link for increasing production. If all winter rapeseed is generally heavily fertilized once during the flowering period, the oil pressed from the increased rapeseed (calculated according to a 20% increase in production) could supply at least 25 million people for one year.
    Why can a heavy top dressing of fertilizer during the initial flowering period of rapeseed significantly increase production? From the perspective of rapeseed growth, after the beginning of spring, the temperature gradually rises, and rapeseed grows and develops rapidly. At this time, the plants need much more nutrients than before due to rapid budding, bolting, increased branching, and enlarged leaves. From the perspective of rapeseed characteristics, rapeseed has an indeterminate inflorescence. It generally takes 30 to 40 days from the beginning of flowering to the end of the flowering period. Because of the long flowering period and the simultaneous flowering and pod formation, more nutrients are consumed. Therefore, it is very necessary to apply a heavy top dressing of fertilizer during the early flowering period when the rapeseed plants urgently need fertilizer and the soil fertility is difficult to meet the needs of the plants.
    The timing of heavy top dressing of fertilizer during the initial flowering period of rapeseed varies depending on the growth conditions and variety characteristics. Generally, it is more appropriate to apply fertilizer when 5%-10% of the plants in the field begin to bloom. The types of fertilizer should mainly be decomposed human and animal manure, with an application rate of about 15 to 20 dan per mu. In areas with chemical fertilizers, quick-acting chemical fertilizers—ammonium sulfate—can also be applied in combination.
    Heavy top dressing of fertilizer during the initial flowering period is one of the important measures to increase rapeseed production. Selecting excellent varieties, improving the quality of rapeseed sowing, and increasing the application of base fertilizer and seedling fertilizer are also important factors in increasing the yield per unit area of rapeseed.

### 重施花肥　增产菜籽

　　重施花肥　增产菜籽
    “麦要浇芽，菜要浇花”，这是我国劳动农民多少年来积累的宝贵经验。从各地的丰产实例来看，油菜在初花期重施一次追肥，一般可以增产二成到三成。在底肥缺乏的情况下，增产效果更为显著。湖南省溆浦县灯塔农业社，在对比试验中，施肥的比不施肥的对照区增产26％。江西省弋阳农业试验站试验结果，在油菜初花期每亩施用人、畜粪十担，比不施的对照区增产31％。
    今年主要产区的油菜，前期生长较好，已为油菜增产打下了良好基础。为了进一步促进油菜增产，力争全面丰收，还要特别抓紧这一重要增产环节。全部冬油菜，如果普遍重施一次花肥，估计增产的菜子（按增产二成计算）榨的油，最少可以供应二千五百多万人吃一年。
    在油菜初花期或苔期重施一次追肥，为什么能够显著增产呢？从油菜生长情况看，开春以后，气温逐渐上升，油菜生长发育较快，此时植株由于现蕾、抽苔迅速、分枝增多、叶片增大，所需养分比以前大大加多。从油菜的特性看，油菜为无限花序，从开始开花到花期终了，一般要经过三四十天。由于花期长和一面开花一面结荚，所以消耗的养分就多。因此，在油菜植株迫切需肥的开花初期，在土壤肥分难以满足植株需要的情况下，重施一次追肥，是十分需要的。
    油菜初花期重施追肥的时间，因为生长情况和品种特性不同而有先后，一般在田间有5％—10％开始现花的时候追肥较为合适。肥料的种类，以腐熟人、畜粪尿为主，每亩施用量十五到二十担左右。有化肥的地区，还可以结合施用速效性的化肥——硫酸氨。
    初花期重施追肥，是油菜的重要的增产措施之一。选用优良品种，提高油菜播种质量，增施基肥和苗肥等，也都是提高油菜单位产量的重要因素。（尤述）
