Inspect Preparations for Spring Ploughing

After the Spring Festival, most parts of the country will successively begin spring ploughing activities. How are the preparations for spring ploughing going? It is necessary to conduct a thorough inspection.

Undeniably, after the rectification campaign and commune consolidation, the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the peasants have been unprecedentedly enhanced, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, and the management of the communes has also improved. In particular, the winter production campaign has laid a solid foundation for spring ploughing and this year's great leap forward. However, it must also be noted that this year's winter production has been centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. It is very likely that some places have focused on water and fertilizer to the neglect of other preparations for spring ploughing. For example, are there enough improved seeds? Are there shortages of draught animals and farm tools? Are the technical measures adapted to the increased production plan? These are all problems.

In mid-January, Xinhui County inspected the preparations for spring ploughing and found that 20% of agricultural cooperatives had not done a good job.

A year's plan starts in the spring. Doing a good job in preparing for spring ploughing is an important condition for ensuring timely spring sowing, which is of great importance to the success of a year's production. It is hoped that the departments concerned will seize the opportunity to conduct an inspection of the preparations for spring ploughing and help the weak links catch up with the advanced. This is very necessary.

    备耕工作要检查
    过了春节，全国大部地区都将陆续开始春耕活动。备耕工作究竟做得怎样了呢？需要很好地检查一下。
    不可否认，经过整风整社，农民的政治觉悟和生产积极性空前提高，干群关系更加密切，社的经营管理也有了改进；特别是经过冬季大生产运动，为春耕生产和今年的大跃进打下了有力的基础。但是也不能不注意到，今年的冬季生产是以兴水利和积肥为中心的，很可能有些地方由于集中精力搞水肥而忽视了其他备耕工作，比如优良种子够不够？耕畜农具缺不缺？技术措施是否和增产计划相适应？这些都是问题。
    新会县在1月中旬检查了备耕情况，发现20％农业社的备耕工作做得不好。
    一年之计在于春。做好备耕工作是保证及时春播的重要条件，这对一年生产成绩的好坏有很大关系。希望有关部门抓紧时机，对备耕工作进行一次检查，帮助薄弱环节赶上先进，非常必要。
