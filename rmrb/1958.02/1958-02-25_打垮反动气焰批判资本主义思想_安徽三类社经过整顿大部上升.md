Smash Counter-Revolutionary Arrogance, Criticize Capitalist Ideologies
Most of Anhui's Third Category Cooperatives Rise After Rectification

(Report from our newspaper) The rectification work of the third category of cooperatives in Anhui Province can be basically concluded by the end of this month. According to statistics in mid-January: of the third category cooperatives that have been rectified, about 46% rose to first category cooperatives, about 37% rose to second category cooperatives, and about 17% were not deep or thorough in their rectification.

Cooperatives that have completed rectification, especially those that have been thoroughly rectified, have completely changed their original backward state. The main manifestations are: implementing the class line and establishing the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperatives; thoroughly smashing counter-revolutionary arrogance, criticizing the capitalist ideologies of rich middle peasants, and raising the socialist consciousness of cooperative members; changing leadership styles and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses; improving management and administration; and a unprecedented surge in the production enthusiasm of cooperative members. For example, before the rectification of the Miaodong Cooperative in Fengyang County, more than 110 cooperative member households clamored to withdraw from the cooperative, and draft animals and farm implements were not managed by dedicated personnel, resulting in the starvation and freezing to death of 248 livestock, damage to more than 110 farm implements, abandonment of more than 1,000 mu of farmland, and a labor attendance rate of only 50%. After the rectification, the accounts that had not been cleared for several years were made public, and the system of contracted work, contracted output, and contracted finances was implemented. Production was carried out in full swing. According to statistics in mid-January: the number of attendees increased from 400 to more than 700, and more than 400,000 dan of manure had been accumulated, exceeding the total amount of manure accumulated since the establishment of the cooperative, and the water conservancy construction task had been overfulfilled by more than 20,000 cubic meters of earthwork.

In cooperatives where the rectification was not deep or thorough, the main problems remained unsolved, or even untouched. For example, the Taoyuan Cooperative in Taoyuan Township, Jinzhai County, remained a third category cooperative after rectification. Its manifestations were: (1) Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements were not attacked. There were thirteen counter-revolutionaries in the cooperative, eleven of whom had blood debts, and no action was taken. The local tyrant Li Yunqing, who had thirteen blood debts, was still at large. Those who should have been arrested were not arrested. The rich peasant element Peng Songyuan, who was criticized, still refused to admit his guilt and complained everywhere. After the upper-middle peasant Feng Kehuang was criticized, he also colluded with backward cooperative members to plan to strike at active elements after the work team left. (2) No action was taken against bad cadres. For example, party member Zhou Zili had been a bandit who robbed people, and when the army marched south, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks as the chairman of the poor peasants' association, and later defected, but no action was taken against him. After the rectification of the Sanhe Cooperative in Xiao County, the bad element Wang Yulan even said: "I must fight the Communist Party again."

The reasons for the rough rectification: the main reason is that the work teams were not at ease with the rectification work and had impatience and fear of difficulties. For example, the provincial party committee work team of the Wobei Cooperative in Woyang County believed that the three-month period for rectification had arrived and requested to return to the office. Cadres of the Jianglou Cooperative work team in Fuyang County were afraid of trouble and time-consuming and unwilling to re-elect the organization, and reported to the higher authorities that "this cooperative cannot find poor peasants to be leading cadres." Zhang Xiushui, the leader of the Taohong Cooperative work team in Xuan Cheng County, repeatedly reported to the county party committee that "we have completed the 1958 production plan and the three contracts," but in reality, none of them were completed. Some work teams in the Chahua District of Fuyang County believed that their task was to carry out extensive debate and rectification was a matter for cooperative cadres. When the Furen Eighth Cooperative was rectifying, the work team requested to return to the office, saying: "The rectification of cooperative cadres can be done, and we will go again when the debate comes."

Party committees at all levels are studying solutions to the above problems: to conduct processing and remedial classes for cooperatives that have not been thoroughly rectified, or to re-rectify them, first arresting counter-revolutionaries, and then launching debates and rectifications; to conduct appropriate criticism and education for cadres who are not at ease with their work, and to require them to resolutely rectify the cooperatives well, thoroughly, and to the end, doing a good job on one cooperative at a time.

    打垮反动气焰批判资本主义思想
    安徽三类社经过整顿大部上升
    本报讯　安徽省对三类社的整顿工作到本月底可以基本结束。据1月中旬统计：整顿过的三类社，升为一类社的约占46％，升为二类社的约占37％，不深不透的约占17％。
    已经整顿结束的合作社，凡是整顿深透的都彻底改变了原来落后的面貌，主要表现是：贯彻了阶级路线，树立了贫、下中农在合作社中的领导优势；彻底的打垮了反动气焰，批判了富裕中农的资本主义思想，提高了社员的社会主义觉悟；改变了领导作风，密切了干群关系；改善了经营管理；社员的生产积极性空前高涨。如凤阳县庙东社整社前有一百一十多户社员闹退社，耕畜农具无专人管理，以致饿死和冻死牲口二百四十八头，损坏农具一百一十多件，抛荒田地一千余亩，劳动出勤率只有50％。整社后，公布了几年来未清理过的账目，实行了包工包产包财务。生产搞得热火朝天。据1月中旬统计：出勤人数由四百人增加到七百多人，已积肥四十多万担，超过办社以来积肥的总和，水利兴修任务已超额完成两万多土方。
    整顿不深不透的合作社，主要是存在的问题没有得到解决，甚至原封未动。如金寨县桃园乡桃园社，整顿后仍为三类社，其表现：（1）地主、富农和反革命分子、坏分子未受到打击。该社有十三个反革命分子，其中有十一人有血债，没作处理，恶霸分子李云清有十三条血债仍逍遥法外。应捕的也没有捕起来。被斗的富农分子彭松远仍不低头认罪，到处喊冤。上中农冯克黄被批判后，还拉拢落后社员计划在工作组走后打击积极分子。（2）对坏干部没有进行处理，如党员周自立曾当过土匪抢过人，大军南下时混入革命阵营当贫农团主席，后又叛变，也未处理。萧县三河社整顿后坏分子王玉兰还说：“我非和共产党再斗一下不可。”
    整社粗糙的原因：主要是工作组不安心整社工作，有急躁和畏难情绪。如涡阳县涡北社省委工作组认为抽调整社三个月时间已到了，要求回机关。阜阳县蒋楼社工作组干部怕麻烦怕费时间不愿改选组织，竟向上级汇报说“这个社找不到贫农当领导骨干。”宣城县桃红社工作组长张修水因急于回机关，屡次向县委汇报说“我们1958年生产计划搞好了，三包也搞好了”，实际上都未搞好。阜阳县插花区有些工作组认为他们的任务是搞大放大鸣大辩论，整改是社干部的事。阜仁八社在整改时工作组要求回机关，说：“整改社干可以搞，到辩论时我们再去。”
    以上问题各级党委已在研究解决：对整顿不彻底的社进行加工补课或重新进行整顿，先逮捕反革命分子，后发动鸣放整改；对不安心工作的干部，进行适当的批评教育，要求坚决把社整好，搞深搞透搞到底，搞好一个算一个。
