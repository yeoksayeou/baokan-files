　　Fiercely Burn Away Conservative, Crawling Thought
    High Yields Even in Barren Mountains; High Yields Even for Low-Yield Crops
　　Representative Li Yaoxian said:
    The area where the Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative of Gaozhangzi Township, Lingyuan County, is located is a barren mountainous region with “no mountain not bald,” “no river not dry,” “lacking all three resources (fuel, fodder, fertilizer),” and “suffering all five disasters (water, drought, insects, hail, frost).” In the past, the masses here always believed that increased production could only crawl, not leap forward, and that the targets of the Agricultural Program could not be achieved. Last year, 110 mu of experimental fields were planted, and the average yield per mu reached 780 jin, nearly four times the local average yield. This example is like a blazing fire, burning away conservative, crawling thought. The entire cooperative plans to achieve the target of 400 jin per mu stipulated in the Agricultural Program eight years ahead of schedule in 1959.
    I want to talk about two issues. First, I will talk about whether the Agricultural Development Program can be achieved in barren mountainous areas; second, I will talk about how to complete the 1958 production increase task.
    I am the director of the Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative of Gaozhangzi Township, Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province. Our place is a place with "many mountains, none of which are not bald; many rivers, none of which are not dry," the land is barren and the yield is very low. In the past few years, the cooperative has been established and production has developed. Last year, based on the average population of the entire cooperative, each person's income was 78 yuan, plus household sideline occupations, it was about 100 yuan. Compared with the local wealthy middle peasants, it has already caught up with them. With the increase in income, the lives of the members have also improved, and there is enough food to eat, and there are no households lacking food. The grain sold to the state has also increased year by year. In 1955, 350,000 jin were sold to the state, in 1956, 300,000 jin more were sold, and last year, 170,000 jin more were sold than the year before. However, the unit area yield per mu in our cooperative has not increased rapidly in the past few years. From 1954 to 1957, it was 180 jin, 200 jin, 210 jin, and 215 jin, climbing up a little every year, but as slow as a turtle, it is still twice as low as the 400 jin required by the Agricultural Development Program. Last year, some of us were worried, watching the plain areas propose to reach the requirements of the program in five or seven years, how long would it take for our mountainous areas to climb? This also caused a dispute in the cooperative. Some people thought, "Our place, which 'lacks all three materials (fuel, fodder, fertilizer) and has all five disasters (water, drought, insects, hail, frost),' is satisfied with being able to get this far. It's really adventurous dreaming to want to hit 400 jin." Later, the general branch decided, based on the previous experience of increasing production in small plots, to try it out anyway and see how much more grain could be produced. They put effort into planting millet on a two-slope field of 110 mu and set a plan of 400 jin. In the autumn, it greatly exceeded the plan, with an average of 780 jin per mu, more than three times higher than other land. This shocked the entire cooperative, and everyone came to see it. It is really possible to make "high yields produced on two-slope land, and high yields produced on low-yield crops." This time, we also learned a lesson: we don't need to crawl anymore, things are done by people, and we can leap forward!
    There is nothing special about the technology for this land to produce so much, only three things. The first is fertilizer. 5,400 jin of pig manure was applied per mu, and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate was also applied as a top dressing. The second is deep plowing, plowing six inches deep, doubling the depth of plowing. We must thank the double-wheeled double-share plow for this. The third is reasonable close planting. Since this 110 mu of two-slope land can do this, why can't other places do it? This greatly broadened the horizons and opened the minds of the members. Those members who opposed it the most and didn't believe that 400 jin could be produced at the beginning of spring also became the most convinced and most opposed to conservatism because we specifically had them harvest, pull, and pack this land, and they personally measured the weight. This matter has become a constantly discussed issue in our cooperative. When we debated the issue of grain and cooperativization last winter and organized the entire cooperative to study how to achieve the Agricultural Development Program, a great debate broke out on whether production could be rapidly increased. The example of this 110 mu of land, after the members' socialist consciousness was raised through the socialist education movement, became a blazing fire, fiercely burning away conservative, crawling thought. The enthusiasm of the members soared, and they insisted that all 15,000 mu of land in the cooperative should produce grain like the 110 mu. After repeated debates and detailed research, we have formulated a plan to compete with the brother cooperatives in the plain areas. We want to achieve the target of 400 jin per mu stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule in 1959. After that, we will cross the Yellow River and compete with the brother cooperatives south of the Yellow River to achieve the 500 jin plan.
    Next, I want to talk about the second issue. The yield per mu in our cooperative will reach 400 jin in 1959, and the planned yield per mu in 1958 is 300 jin. Compared with 215 jin in 1957, this is a leap forward. We guarantee that this leap forward will be made. The method is the same as that of brother cooperatives across the country. Respond to the call of the Party and mobilize all forces to engage in a high tide of agricultural production. Since the winter, almost 100% of the labor force in our cooperative has participated in farmland construction projects and manure accumulation campaigns. In previous years, after the snow and ground froze, it was a slack winter, but this year it has become a busy winter, doing the same work. Now, two-thirds of all projects have been completed, and the plan can be overfulfilled before spring plowing.
    In our place, in order to permanently guarantee a good harvest, we must achieve the four sentences that the old generations dreamed of for many years, but could never achieve in the individual economy: that is, to achieve "all mountains are green, all waters are clear, river channels are squeezed narrower, and gullies are leveled." This winter's production upsurge is focused on doing this. The entire winter requires about nearly 100,000 workdays, equivalent to 30% of the annual workdays. We started to dress up every bald mountain in this way, that is, to give it a "hat, waistband, and leggings." "Wearing a hat" means planting trees on the top. This spring, we can plant 2,000 mu of trees, and another 1,500 mu in the autumn, which can green 20% of the barren mountains and bald ridges, and we plan to complete all greening in another four years. "Waistband" means building terraces, which is the focus of current construction. There are a total of 3,500 mu of mountainous land in the cooperative, and 2,500 mu of terraces have been built. The remaining ones will all be completed before spring plowing, so that all mountainous land will be terraced. Small terraces are also being renovated and connected into large areas. The entire cooperative also has more than 6,000 mu of sloping land, all of which must be "dams along the slope, horizontal contour lines, leveled hilltops, and filled-up depressions" before spring plowing. "Leggings" means building valley weirs at the foot of the mountain, which we call blocking mountain gullies, to retain water and soil and create platform land. More than 2,000 of these have been completed, and it is estimated that 4,000 can be built before spring plowing, and a large number of purple wattle trees will be planted along both sides of the gully. In another three to five years, when these projects are completed, we can "have green mountains and clear rivers." At the same time, we are also fighting for land with the river滩. The old people say that both sides of the river used to be good land, but later they were taken away by the river. We are determined to take it back. The method is to cooperate with water and soil conservation projects, planting poplar trees on the river滩 to squeeze it, squeezing it towards the foot of the mountain, or squeezing it from both sides towards the middle. "The river channel should be dredged so that the water does not rush around. If there is a mountain, rely on the mountain; if there is no mountain, fix it in the middle." As a result of doing this, 400 mu have been reclaimed last year, and 750 mu can be reclaimed this year. It is planned to reclaim 3,000 mu of land in five years. As long as water and soil conservation is done well, "leveling the gullies" will not be difficult. In the upsurge of production, we have leveled fifteen gullies and reclaimed seventy or eighty mu of land, and we are continuing to fill the gullies. This year, our cooperative is also learning from the methods of brother cooperatives and building two ponds and dams. One has already been completed, and we are preparing to start a trial planting of 60 mu of paddy fields this year, and then continue to do it on a large scale. The area of irrigated land has also been expanded.
    The fertilizer accumulation campaign is another important part of the production upsurge. By the time of spring plowing, the amount of manure accumulated, picked, dug, burned, exchanged, and swept can reach 90 million jin, 50% more than last year. In previous years, manure was only transported in large quantities in the first month of the lunar year, but this year it was transported early. 60% has been transported in early January, and all of it can be transported before the Spring Festival. An average of 5,400 jin can be applied per mu, which is a guarantee for increasing production. Now, our cooperative has an average of 2.2 pigs per household. By the end of the year, we will develop to one pig per person. With the development of other livestock, we can completely achieve 6,500 jin of manure fertilizer per mu next year.
    The success of deep plowing on 110 mu of land last year dispelled the doubt that "the ground is cold when plowed deep." The new agricultural tools have gained credibility. After the autumn harvest, thirteen double-wheeled double-share plows, twenty-eight step plows that were not "welcomed," five wave-type plows, etc., plus more than 130 old agricultural implements were all dispatched. Except for the steep slopes, all were plowed, of which 40% were deep plowed.
    This production upsurge, because it was launched after the socialist education movement, has changed the face of our cooperative in all aspects from production to ideology. People who were half-hearted about socialism have greatly decreased; those wealthy middle peasants who held their tails high last summer lowered their tails after everyone's debate. No one listened to their words, and some people's tones have also changed because they cannot but be convinced. Some members who did not like to work very much have also changed greatly because the whole atmosphere has changed. The cooperative director is now not worried about the low attendance rate, but is too busy with quotas and plans. Everyone is very enthusiastic, making the elderly and children unable to sit still. In our cooperative, there are five or six elderly people over the age of seventy who have retired. They can't sit still and have come out to ask to do some work, or go up the mountain to take a look; the children are also carrying small ladles to pick up sheep manure pellets, saying that they want to save tuition fees for themselves so that they don't have to ask their mothers for it in the future.
    The management and administration of the cooperative have been improved somewhat in the rectification and production upsurge. The cadres of our cooperative all feel that the great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate are really good methods and really solve problems. Things that are difficult to handle are easily solved by a great debate. Similarly, it is no longer possible for the cadres of the cooperative to be bureaucratic because the members also want to have a great airing of views, a great blooming, and a great debate. If they are bureaucratic, they will be criticized and forced to correct themselves. In terms of management and administration, we have also implemented the method of "assessing work points based on mu, setting production based on land, paying work points based on production, and rewarding overproduction" since last year, and it has been improved this year. In the past, we used the "three guarantees" method. "Three guarantees" sometimes have loopholes and are prone to the tendency of "emphasizing work points and de-emphasizing production" because sometimes stealing work is cheaper than being penalized for reducing production. For example, a plot of land guarantees 1,000 jin of production and 50 work points, but only 40 work points are actually done, and 10 work points are concealed. In the autumn, 800 jin of grain are produced. The reduction of 200 jin is penalized at 40%, which is 80 jin, equal to four work points. He still gets 46 work points, 6 more work points. These 6 work points are used for other work and are also counted as work points, and more income is earned from personal sideline occupations. This is exploited, and it is not rewarding diligence and punishing laziness, but rewarding laziness and punishing diligence. The new method is to calculate a number of how many jin of grain are equal to one work point based on the "three guarantees." For example, 30 jin of grain is equal to one work point. In the autumn, for every 30 jin of grain turned in by the team within the guaranteed production, the cooperative gives one work point; for every 30 jin of grain produced over the guaranteed part, one and a half work points are given; and for every 30 jin of high-yield records, two work points are given as a reward for exceeding the guaranteed production, in order to encourage the members to come up with ways to increase production. The members all welcome this method, and the number of people who are parochial and selfish has greatly decreased because it is useless to steal work and hide production, and no benefit can be gained. The members all take the initiative to care about the increase in production. For example, some teams not only weed three times as stipulated by the work points, but weed four or five times. In order to increase production, the Second Team also raised funds to buy a car, and four teams saved financial expenses to buy ammonium sulfate for top dressing, and some teams bought sprayers, etc., in order to produce more yields and earn more work points and rewards. This better solves the contradictions between the collective and the individual, and between the cooperative and the team, and improves the members' collective concept and socialist consciousness. We are preparing to further improve this method in order to better encourage the members' enthusiasm and develop the cooperative's production.
    We feel that there are more activities and more tiring since the winter than in any other year, but it is not as suffocating as last summer. On the contrary, we are doing it very smoothly and very happily. We fully know that this new situation of riding the wind and waves is the great result of the Party launching the rectification movement. With a heart of great gratitude, we express to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that we are determined to resolutely support and support the realization and completion of our country's budget and construction plan with practical actions of overfulfilling the cooperative's production plan and realizing the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
    Finally, the representatives of our province, Liu Hongda, Zhang Wenchun, Wu Fengqi, Zhang Zhenfa, Zheng Kuifu, and Tong Yulan, asked me to represent them in expressing to the conference: they fully agree with the national budget and the national plan, and they asked me to express their attitude on their behalf that their six cooperatives will guarantee to achieve and exceed the grain and cotton production increase targets stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program this year.
    I wish the conference a successful conclusion.

　　狠狠烧毁保守爬行思想
    贫瘠山地也高产　低产作物也高产
　　李耀先代表说：
    凌源县高杖子乡联合农业社所在的地区是个“无山不秃”“无河不干”“三料（燃料、饲料、肥料）全缺”“五灾（水、旱、虫、雹、霜）俱全”的贫瘠山区。这里的群众过去一直认为增产只能爬行，不能跃进，无法实现农业纲要的指标。去年，这里种了一百一十亩试验田，结果平均亩产达到七百八十斤，接近当地平均亩产的四倍。这一事例就像一把烈火，烧毁了保守爬行思想，全社计划在一九五九年即提前八年实现农业纲要规定的亩产四百斤的指标。
    我想讲两个问题。第一，先讲一讲在贫瘠山区能不能实现农业发展纲要；第二，讲讲怎么完成一九五八年增产任务。
    我是辽宁省凌源县高杖子乡联合农业社的主任。我们那里是个“山多，无山不秃；河多，无河不干”的地方，土地瘠薄，产量很低。这几年办社，生产有发展，去年要按全社人口来平均，每人收入是七十八元，加上家庭副业，是一百元上下。同当地富裕中农比较已经赶上他们了。收入增加，社员生活也就有了改善，粮食够吃了，没有缺粮户了。卖给国家的粮食也年年增加了。一九五五年卖给国家三十五万斤，一九五六年多卖了三十万斤，去年比前年又多卖了十七万斤。但是我们社每市亩的单位面积产量几年来增长的不快。从一九五四年到一九五七年是一百八十斤、二百斤、二百一十斤、二百一十五斤，每年都往上爬一点，可是像乌龟似的那么慢，同农业发展纲要要求的四百斤相比还差一倍。去年我们有些发愁，看着人家平原地区提出五年、七年达到纲要要求，我们山区爬到多?才行呢？社里为这个还引起了一场争论，有些人认为，“咱们这个‘三料（燃料、饲料、肥料）俱缺，五灾（水、旱、虫、雹、霜）俱全’的地方，能弄到这样就满足了，还想打四百斤，真是冒进作梦”。后来总支根据以前小块地的增产经验，决定无论如何也得硬着头皮试验一下，看看到底能多打多少粮，就在一块有一百一十亩的二坡地上下功夫试种了谷子，定了个四百斤的计划。到秋天大大超过了计划，每市亩平均竟打了七百八十斤，高出别的地三倍多，这一下子震动了全社，大家都来看，真的可以使“高产产在二坡地上，高产出在低产作物上。”这一来，我们也得到了教训：不用再爬行了，事在人为，可以跃进！
    这块地打这么多，也没有什么特别的技术，只是三条。第一是肥料，每市亩地上了五千四百斤猪圈粪，还追了十斤硫氨。第二是深翻，翻六寸，深翻一倍，这得感谢双轮双铧犁。第三是合理密植。既然这一百一十亩二坡子地能做到这样，别的地方为什么就做不到呢？这给社员大大开了眼界，开了脑筋，那些春起最反对、最不相信能打四百斤的社员，也由于我们专门把这块地的割、拉、打包给他们，他们亲自量了份量，就变成了最信服、最反对保守的了。这件事在我们社里成了一个引起不断谈论的问题，赶到去年冬天我们辩论完了粮食和合作化问题，组织全社研究如何实现农业发展纲要的时候，就爆发了一场能否迅速提高产量的大辩论。这一百一十亩地的事例，在社员经过社会主义教育运动提高了社会主义觉悟之后，就变成了一把烈火，狠狠地烧毁了保守爬行思想，社员的干劲高涨，非叫全社一万五千余亩土地都像一百一十亩那样给出粮不可。经过反复地辩论和详细的研究，我们已经制定了计划，要同平原地区的兄弟社竞赛，我们要在一九五九年提前八年实现农业发展纲要规定的每市亩四百斤的计划，以后我们就要跨过黄河同黄河南的兄弟社竞赛，实现五百斤的计划。
    下面我想讲第二个问题。我们社一九五九年单产要达到四百斤，一九五八年的单产计划是三百斤，这同一九五七年的二百一十五斤比较起来是一个跃进，这个跃进我们保证跃得过去。办法就是同全国各兄弟社一样，响应党的号召，发动一切力量搞农业生产高潮。我们社入冬以后，全社几乎百分之百的劳动力都参加了兴修农田工程和积肥运动，往年下雪地冻以后就是冬闲，今年变成了冬忙，一样的干，现在全部工程已完成了三分之二，到春耕前可以超额完成计划。
    在我们这个地方，要想永久地保证农业丰收，必须做到老辈人多年梦想、但是在个体经济时永远也办不到的四句话：就是做到“有山皆绿，有水皆清，河套挤窄，沟子弄平”。这次冬季生产高潮，我们就是集中力量这么办的。整个冬天大约需要近十万个工，等于全年劳动日的百分之三十。我们对每一座秃山开始用这种办法来打扮它，就是给它“戴帽子，捆腰带，打裹脚”。“戴帽子”就是上边栽树，今春能栽树二千亩，秋天再栽一千五百亩，能绿化百分之二十的荒山秃岭，准备再有四年就全部完成绿化。“捆腰带”就是修梯田，是当前施工的重点，全社山地共三千五百市亩，梯田已修成二千五百亩，剩下的，春耕前全搞完，使山地全部梯田化。小块梯田也都加以改造，连成大片的。全社还有六千余亩坡地，春耕前都要做到“坡地修坝沿，湾垅水平线，高岗撤平了，洼地往起垫”。“打裹脚”就是在山下修谷坊，我们叫闸山沟，揽住水土，搞台子地。这个已经完成了两千多道，估计春耕前可搞出四千道并且在沟两沿大量种紫穗槐。再过三、五年这些工程都做好了，我们就可以“有山皆绿、有河皆清”了。与此同时，我们还同河滩争地，听老人说，河两岸原来都是好地，后来都被河夺去了，我们决心把它再夺回来，办法是配合水土保持工程，在河滩栽杨树挤它，往山跟挤，或者由两岸往中间挤，“河道要疏通，不叫水乱冲，有山靠山去，无山固定在当中”，这么办的结果，去年已夺回四百市亩，今年能夺回七百五十市亩地，五年内计划夺回三千亩地。只要水土保持搞好了，“沟子弄平”也就不困难了，在生产高潮中，我们已经弄平了十五条沟，搞出了七、八十亩地，还正在继续填沟。我们社今年还学习兄弟社的办法，修了两座塘坝，已经修成了一座，准备从今年开始先试开六十亩水田，以后再继续大搞。水浇地的面积也扩大了。
    积肥运动是生产高潮的又一个重要内容，到春耕为止，“积、拣、挖、烧、换、扫”的粪肥能达九千万斤，比去年多百分之五十，往年都是正月才大送粪，今年早早就开送了，一月上旬已送出百分之六十，春节前可全部送完，每市亩地平均起来能够上五千四百斤，这对增产是一个保证。现在我们社里每户平均是二点二头猪，到年底要发展到每人一头猪，加上其它牲畜的发展，明年的粪肥完全可以做到每市亩六千五百斤。
    去年一百一十亩地深翻的成功，打消了“翻深了，地冷”的怀疑，新农具有了信用了，秋收之后，十三台双轮双铧犁，不受“欢迎”的二十八台步犁，五台波式犁等，加上旧农具一百三十多台全部出动，除去陡坡地全都翻了，其中深翻的百分之四十。
    这个生产高潮因为是在社会主义教育运动之后开展起来的，所以从生产到思想各个方面都改变了我们社的面貌。和社会主义闹三心二意的人大大减少了；那些在去年夏天高高翘起尾巴的富裕中农，经大家一辩论，尾巴就夹起来了，他们的话没有人听了，有些人的调子也变了，因为他不能不折服。有些不大爱干活的社员也大大改变了，因为整个的风气变了。当社主任的现在不是为出勤率不高而发愁，而是为定额和计划忙不过来了。大家干劲很大，使老年人和孩子也坐不住了。我们社里有五、六位年过七十岁的已经养老的老人，坐不住了，也出来要求干点活，或者上山去看看；小孩子也带着个小瓢拣羊粪蛋，说是要给自己攒学费，以后不用向妈妈要了。
    社的经营管理工作在整风和生产高潮中得到了一些改进。我们社干部都感到大鸣大放大辩论真是好办法，真解决问题，不好办的事情，一大辩论就很容易地解决了。同样的，社干部要官僚也不行了，因为社员也要来个大鸣大放大辩论，要官僚就得受批评、逼着得改正。在经营管理上我们从去年起还实行了“按亩评工，按地定产，按产付工，超产奖励”的办法，今年又加以改进。以前是用“三包”办法，“三包”有时出漏洞，容易产生“重工轻产”的偏向，因为偷工有时比减产受罚还有便宜。譬如一块地包产一千斤，包工五十个，实际只干四十个工，瞒工十个，到秋天打粮八百斤，减产的二百斤按百分之四十计罚，是八十斤，等于四个工，他仍得四十六个工，多得六个工，这六个工干在别的活上又要计工，干个人副业，也多收入。这就被钻了空子，不是奖勤惩懒，而是奖懒惩勤了。实行新的办法就是在“三包”基础上，最后综合计算出一个多少斤粮等于一个工的数字，譬如三十斤粮折一个工，秋天队里在包产产量内每交三十斤粮，社里就给一个工；超产部分每三十斤粮给一个半工，高产纪录的每三十斤则给两个工，作为对超过包产产量的奖励，以鼓励社员都来想办法超产。社员都欢迎这个办法，闹本位、耍私心眼的大大减少了，因为偷工瞒产没有用，得不到便宜。社员都主动关心产量的提高，例如有些队不只是按包工规定铲三遍，而是铲四遍、五遍，二队为了增加生产，还自己筹备买了一台车，还有四个队自己节约财务开支，买硫氨追肥，有的队买喷雾器等以求多打产量，多领工和得奖励，这样就比较好地解决了集体与个人、社与队之间的矛盾，提高了社员的集体观念和社会主义觉悟。我们准备再进一步地改进这个办法，以更好地鼓舞社员的干劲，发展社的生产。
    我们感到入冬以来比哪年活都多，都累，但是却不像去年夏天那么憋气；相反，干的十分顺气，干的十分痛快。我们充分知道这种乘风破浪的新局面，是党发动整风运动所造成的伟大成果，我们怀着万分感激的心情向党中央和毛主席表示，我们决心以超额完成社的生产计划、提前实现农业发展纲要的实际行动，来坚决拥护和支持我们国家的预算和建设计划的实现和完成。
    末了，我们省的刘洪达、张文春、吴凤岐、张振发、郑奎福、佟玉兰等代表，叫我代表他们向大会表示：他们完全赞成国家预算和国家计划，并且叫我替他们表示态度，他们六个社都要在今年保证实现和超过农业发展纲要规定的粮棉增产指标。
    祝大会胜利成功。
