    I fully endorse the reports made at the conference and will resolutely implement them in future work. Now I will talk about the issue of mass education in Henan Province.

    **Mass Education: Huge in Scale, Diligent Study: Excellent Results**

    Since the liberation of Henan Province in 1949, middle and primary schools have greatly developed. Currently, there are over 312,000 middle school students in the province, an increase of 6.6 times compared to 1949; and over 4,890,000 primary school students, an increase of more than two times compared to 1949. However, this is still not enough to fully meet the needs of the masses. The state has already made great efforts, but for the time being, it cannot allocate more money to develop middle and primary schools. Therefore, vigorously promoting community-run schools and meeting the needs of the masses' children to attend school as much as possible is a very important matter.

    In the past two years, community-run schools in Henan Province, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have experienced rapid development, just like other construction projects. According to current statistics, community-run junior middle schools enrolled 2,540 classes in 1957, with 138,766 students; community-run senior middle schools enrolled 35 classes, with 1,827 students; and community-run primary schools have 226,755 students, of which 100,000 were developed in 1957. The number of students in community-run middle schools has reached 2,586 classes, with 141,335 students, accounting for 28.26 percent of the total number of students in public and private middle schools. Judging from the situation of these community-run schools, they can be basically divided into three categories. The first category is those run by factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and organizations. These schools are mostly located in cities, and although the number is not large, the quality is relatively good. The second category is those collectively run by factory and mine workers, enterprise and institution cadres, street residents, and agricultural cooperative members. These schools are mostly located in rural areas, with the largest number, and are the main form of mass education. The third category is privately run schools, which are small in number and still have some problems.

    The vast majority of students in community-run schools have a high enthusiasm for learning and good grades. Students deeply understand that starting a school is difficult and the opportunity is hard-won, so they inherit the excellent tradition of "diligently farming and studying hard." According to reports, in eighteen schools in Xuchang, Shangshui, and other counties, there has been no absenteeism in half a year, and assignments such as compositions, drafts, and notes are complete. According to a survey of Huangzhuang Community-Run Middle School in Xuchang, the test scores of fifty students in the literature class were: ten with a score of four, thirty-seven with a score of three, and three with a score of less than three; the test scores of fifty-four students in the arithmetic class were: twenty-one with a score of one hundred, five with a score above ninety, seven with a score above eighty, fifteen with a score above seventy, three with a score above sixty, and only three who failed. The grades of many community-run schools have basically caught up with the level of regular schools.

    **Rely on the Masses, Make Do with What You Have, Resolve School-Building Difficulties**

    How did community-run schools in Henan Province develop?

    Because community-run schools are newly established, they have difficulties in terms of school buildings, funding, and teachers. However, adhering to the spirit of thrift in running all undertakings and fully relying on the strength of the masses, we adopted the working method of the mass line. These difficulties have been solved with the help of the masses.

    We made do with what we had and used various methods to solve the problems of school buildings and furniture. In terms of school buildings, some were newly built, some were allocated public houses by the government, and some were borrowed, leased, or shared with spare-time schools. In terms of school furniture, generally, students brought their own, new furniture was made, or furniture from former private schools was borrowed. Thanks to the strong support of the masses who contributed labor and materials, general community-run schools did not spend much money in this regard.

    The funding for schools is based on the principle that whoever attends school pays for it. The fee standard is determined according to the production and living standards of the local people. Generally, middle school students pay four yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees per semester, with a few paying as much as twenty yuan. Some schools only charge public miscellaneous fees and allocate work points to teachers. According to surveys, each student bears a burden of forty yuan per year at most and fifteen yuan at least, which is two-thirds less than going to school elsewhere. Moreover, this burden can be completely solved by the income earned by students participating in labor during vacations and after school.

    The hiring of teachers is done locally. This way, the township and cooperative understand the teachers, and it is also convenient for leadership. According to statistics from Shangshui and Wuyang counties, 70 percent of the teachers in community-run middle schools are high school graduates and intellectuals from society. Only a few community-run schools in individual places have transferred some incumbent backbone forces from public schools. Last year, teachers participated in the rural mass debate together with students. The awareness of the vast majority of teachers has been raised, they can work hard to study their profession, and work actively, basically able to meet the needs of students. When schools hire teachers, they are carefully selected, so teachers are generally competent and can work with peace of mind. There are individual exceptions.

    Regarding the administrative leadership of community-run schools, our practice is: whoever runs the school leads it. Community-run schools have established management committees, whose members are the party and government leaders of the township and cooperative, local school principals, cultural instructors, enthusiastic school organizers, student parents, etc. The management committee is responsible for handling major school issues. The current situation is: the county education bureau guides the business, the party branch of the township and cooperative is responsible for political and ideological education work, and the school management committee handles fundraising and other matters.

    **Community-Run Middle Schools Have Five Major Benefits**

    Community-run middle schools have five major benefits and four satisfactions.

    Judging from the situation since last year, the masses have responded very well to community-run schools. Our investigations have also proved that the effect of community-run schools is good. Generally speaking, community-run schools have five major benefits and four satisfactions.

    The five major benefits are:

    **Able to Meet the Needs of the Masses**

    First, it has satisfied, to a certain extent, the growing need for cultural life of the masses. With the great development of industry and agriculture, the masses' demand to send their children to school has become increasingly urgent. When the state is currently unable to run more schools, mobilizing the masses to use collective strength to solve the problem of their children's schooling is indeed a good way, as experience has shown. Although the quality of schools run by the masses is not consistent at present, in general, it is better for students to be able to attend school than not to attend school; it is better to run more schools and recognize more characters than to run fewer schools and recognize fewer characters. There are also two lines of thought on this issue: one is to completely rely on the state to take care of everything, aiming too high, and looking down on community-run schools; the other is, under the auspices of the state, to follow the mass line and vigorously promote the collective running of schools by the masses. In our work, we have seriously criticized the first guiding ideology and adhered to the second guiding ideology, so community-run schools have developed rapidly.

    **Can Reduce the Burden on Families**

    Second, students go to school nearby, reducing the burden on families. Community-run schools have implemented the principle of enrolling students nearby. Many regions have made unified plans for public and private schools when building schools. For example, in Xinxiang, Shangqiu, and other special districts, every township has a middle school. The homes of students at Xuchang County Middle School are generally within seven or eight li, and 460 of the 651 students in six schools in Qi County, Kaifeng, and other places live within five li of the school. Being close to home makes it convenient for students to study and work, and also reduces the burden on students' families.

    **Close Integration of Education and Labor**

    Third, education can be closely integrated with labor and practice. Students in community-run middle schools have more opportunities and longer time to participate in labor. In daily labor, students naturally cultivate labor views and develop labor habits. Students in community-run middle schools participate in labor in their spare time, Saturday afternoons, and Sundays. Many students bring manure baskets to school. The slogan they put forward is "Busy with production, free for reading." If there is no work in the village on Sundays, they still insist on attending classes. When production is busy, they take holidays to participate in labor. Twenty-nine students from Xiaozhang Village Community-Run Middle School in Shangshui County earned 2,400 work points for drought resistance in a week; sixty students from Liuzhuang participated in twelve days of rush planting and earned 8,000 work points. Wang Airong, a female teacher at the school, led students to dig wells and slept on the construction site at night, which not only completed the well-digging task of the cooperative ahead of schedule but also encouraged women to actively participate in labor. The masses in Daolinggang Township, Xihua, seeing that the students worked well and could learn culture, gave the community-run middle school in the township ten mu of experimental land, the income of which belonged to the school, to help solve the school's funding problems. Experimental gardens are a problem that has not been well solved in public schools for a long time, but community-run middle schools have solved it.

    **Convenient for Townships and Cooperatives to Lead the School**

    Fourth, most schools are located in rural areas, making it convenient for townships and cooperatives to lead the school. Community-run schools are directly led by townships and cooperatives, who pay close attention to the ideological education of teachers and students in a very concrete way. Party and government leaders of townships and cooperatives often go to schools to give reports to students, and some also frequently visit student parents. Doing so can solve the ideological problems of teachers, students, and parents in a timely and effective manner. For example, after the opening of Xihua Daolinggang Community-Run Middle School, the students' thinking was very chaotic. They said that the school was divided into community-run and public parts, which was unfair to the students; they disliked the simple equipment of the community-run school, and so on. The school's management committee led the students to use the method of great airing, great blooming, and great debate to mobilize students to debate these issues. In the end, the students realized that going to school was their own business, and the state could not take care of everything. Everyone was at ease to study, and the teachers also said that they must run the school well.

    **Save a Lot of Expenses for the Country**

    Fifth, it saves a lot of expenses for the country. It can be said that the vast majority of mass education has achieved diligence and thrift in running schools. Although there are still a few school buildings and furniture in community-run schools that are newly built and newly made, generally, attention is paid to the principle of thrift. If you can avoid spending money, you avoid it, and if you can spend less money, you spend less. The 200 yuan of start-up funds for Gouzhao Community-Run Middle School in the suburbs of Zhengzhou were used to repair thirteen tile houses and were not used up. A basketball hoop was also made. It cost only seventy yuan to build six school buildings at Xucun Community-Run Middle School in Shangshui. The public miscellaneous fees controlled by the school are very tight, limited to expenses such as chalk and paper, with the most per class not exceeding eight yuan. Many schools advocate that students bring "a bundle of firewood back and forth" to school. The firewood used for heating, drinking boiled water, and steaming buns is solved in this way in schools such as Xucun in Shangshui and Daolinggang in Xihua. Since there is no book fee for schools, everyone is mobilized to donate books. Luotang Community-Run Middle School in Shangshui and Yumin Middle School in Wuyang collected more than 2,000 books and established a library to solve the students' extracurricular reading problems. Students help farms cut soybeans and pick sweet potatoes in the fields, using labor income to solve the cost of subscribing to newspapers. Some schools also plan to raise fish, pigs, and plant lotus roots to reduce tuition fees and reduce the burden on students with income from sideline production.

    **Community-Run Middle Schools Have Four Satisfactions**

    Cadres are Satisfied, Parents are Satisfied, Students are Satisfied, and Teachers are Satisfied

    The four satisfactions are:

    First, community-run middle schools are directly led by townships and cooperatives. When the central work comes, it is easy to grasp, and the cadres are satisfied. Community-run schools can combine with the central work and promote other work, which is a good assistant for grassroots cadres in townships and cooperatives. Political classes in community-run middle schools are often taught by the secretaries of party organizations in townships and cooperatives, and the content of the textbooks is closely combined with the central work. Whatever the farmers do, the school teaches. When the central work comes, they first report to the students. In this way, teachers and students become a propaganda army and can publicize policies. Therefore, cadres regard teachers and students as reliable assistants in their work.

    Second, learning is not divorced from production, tuition fees are easy to solve, and parents are satisfied. Students attending community-run schools read books without delaying production, and tuition fees can be solved by the students themselves, so parents are very satisfied.

    Third, more students have the opportunity to attend school, and students are satisfied.

    Fourth, some early established schools have given strong support to those established later, reducing the difficulty in teaching, and teachers are satisfied.

    Community-run schools have many benefits, and all parties are satisfied, so they are easy to consolidate. According to our survey, community-run schools in Zhoukou, Shangshui, Xuchang, Wuyang, and other counties and cities in Xuchang Special District can be 100% consolidated, and community-run schools in Xinxiang Special District can also be consolidated by more than 90%.

    The masses are willing to run schools, and the masses will also run schools. Primary and secondary school education is an education undertaking that is closely related to the interests of the masses. It is difficult to develop and improve without the support of the masses. The experience of mass education in our province proves that it is entirely feasible to rely on social and mass forces and adopt various forms to run schools, and the effect is also very good. We regard mass education as a policy that must be adopted in the education sector for a considerable period of time in the future. Along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, there will also be a great leap forward in education.

    Henan plans to develop another 300,000 students in community-run primary schools and 180,000 students in community-run middle schools this year.

    Now let's talk about some issues to be resolved.

    Community-run schools are a new task, and we do not have much experience, so there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. For example, current schools still lack some necessary systems to run the schools better; but this does not mean to create a set of systems that restrict the development of community-run schools. Some people are not clear enough about the goal of cultivating students and always compare equipment and conditions with public schools; some teachers are not of high enough quality; some schools charge too much; some schools still have extravagance and waste, and so on. But we believe that as long as we strengthen leadership, further implement the policy of community-run schools, and conscientiously summarize the advanced experience created by the masses, these problems can be solved.

    In short, primary and secondary school education is general education, a local and mass cultural education undertaking. Its development should not be separated from the foundation of industrial and agricultural production, nor can it be separated from the help and support of the broad masses. In recent years, under the correct leadership of party organizations and people's governments at all levels and the strong support of the people, primary and secondary school education in our province has made great progress. However, with the gradual improvement of people's lives, more and more people are sending their children to school. The current situation of primary and secondary school education in our province, whether in terms of quantity or quality, is far from meeting the needs of the masses. At the same time, the state has made great efforts in developing primary and secondary school education, and it is currently impossible to increase funding too much to open more schools. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the policy of mass education and encourage social groups and the masses to run schools to supplement the deficiencies of state-run schools. Our province plans to develop another 300,000 students in community-run primary schools and 180,000 students in community-run middle schools in 1958, as a goal to strive for. We are determined to have a great leap forward in education in 1958, along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    Finally, I would like to make a suggestion: we feel that the number of students estimated to be enrolled in schools run by the masses themselves in the draft national economic plan for 1958 is too small. For example, it is estimated that 180,000 students can be developed in community-run junior middle schools. As mentioned earlier, Henan alone plans to newly develop another 180,000 students this year on the basis of the past. Therefore, it is recommended that relevant state departments appropriately increase the target for mass education.

### 坚持群众办学方针　教育事业才能跃进  高镇五代表谈河南省群众办学的经验

    坚持群众办学方针　教育事业才能跃进
    高镇五代表谈河南省群众办学的经验
    我完全拥护大会上所作的几个报告，并要在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我来谈谈河南省群众办学的问题。
    群众办学　数量巨大  勤耕苦读　成绩很好
    河南省自一九四九年解放以来，中、小学有很大发展。目前我省在校的中学生有三十一万二千多人，比一九四九年增长六点六倍；在校的小学生有四百八十九万多人，比一九四九年增长了两倍多。但是，还不能完全满足群众的要求。国家已经作了很大的努力，目前暂时还不能拿出更多的钱用在发展中、小学方面。因此，大力提倡民办学校，尽量满足群众子弟上学的要求，是件很重要的事情。
    近两年来，河南省民办学校在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，和其他各项建设事业一样有突飞猛进的发展。根据目前统计，民办初中一九五七年度招生二千五百四十班，十三万八千七百六十六人；民办高中招生三十五班，一千八百二十七人；民办小学在校学生二十二万六千七百五十五人，其中一九五七年发展十万人。民办中学在校学生已到达二千五百八十六班，十四万一千三百三十五人，占公、私立中学在校学生人数的百分之二十八点二六。从这些民办学校的情况来看，基本上可分三类。第一类是厂矿、企业、机关、团体举办的，这类学校多设在城市，数量虽不多，但质量比较好。第二类是厂矿、企业职工，机关、团体干部，街道群众和农业社社员集体举办的，这类学校多设在农村，数量最大，是群众办学的主要形式。第三类是私人办的学校，数量不多，目前还存在一些问题。
    民办学校的学生绝大多数学习的情绪很高，成绩也不错。学校创业维艰，机会得来不易，学生们对此深有体会，因而他们继承了“勤耕田、苦读书”的优良传统。据了解，许昌、商水等县十八个学校，半年来没有旷课现象，作文、演草、笔记等作业很齐全。据许昌黄庄民办中学的调查，文学课五十人的测验成绩是：四分的十人，三分的三十七人，不到三分的三人；算术课五十四人的测验成绩是：一百分的二十一人，九十分以上的五人，八十分以上的七人，七十分以上的十五人，六十分以上的三人，不及格的只有三人。有不少民办学校的成绩，基本上赶上了正规学校的水平。
    依靠群众　因陋就简  建校困难　迎刃而解
    我省民办学校是怎样开展起来的呢？
    民办学校因为是初创，所以在校舍、经费、师资等方面都有困难。但是我们本着勤俭举办一切事业的精神，充分依靠群众的力量，采取了群众路线的工作方法。这些困难都在群众的帮助下迎刃而解了。
    我们因陋就简，采用各种办法解决了校舍、校具问题。在校舍方面，有的是新建，有的公家拨给了公房，有的是借用、租赁或同业余学校共同使用。在校具方面，一般是自带、新做或借用过去私立学校的校具。由于群众大力支持，献工献料，一般的民办学校在这方面都花钱不多。
    学校的经费是采取谁上学谁拿钱的办法。根据当地群众的生产和生活水平来确定收费标准。一般的中学生每学期交学杂费四元，有少数的多到二十元。也有些学校，仅收公杂费，另给教师拨付工分。据调查，每个学生每年负担多则四十元，少则十五元左右，比去外地上学要节省三分之二。而且这个负担，学生在假期和课余参加劳动所得的报酬，完全可以解决。
    聘请教师是就地取材。这样乡、社对教师了解，也便于领导。据商水、舞阳县的统计，民办中学的教师有百分之七十是高中毕业生和社会上的知识分子。只有个别地方的民办学校从公立学校调去了一些现职骨干力量。去年，教师同学生一起参加了农村大辩论，绝大部分教师觉悟提高，能努力钻研业务，积极工作，基本上能满足学生的要求。学校在请教师时，都经过慎重选择，所以教师们大都能称职和安心工作，不好的是个别的。
    关于民办学校的行政领导问题，我们做法是：谁办就由谁来领导。民办学校都设立管理委员会，管理委员会的成员是乡、社的党政负责人、当地学校校长、文化教员、热心办学人士、学生家长等，管理委员会负责处理学校重大问题。目前的情况是：县教育局指导业务，乡、社党的支部负责政治思想教育工作，经费筹措等由学校管理委员会办理。
    民办中学有五大好处
    民办中学有五大好处和四大满意。
    从去年以来的情况看，群众对民办学校，反应很好。经过我们的调查也证明民办学校的效果不错。总的说来，民办学校有五大好处和四大满意。
    五大好处是：
    能满足群众需要
    第一，在一定程度上满足了群众日益增长的文化生活需要。随着工农业的大发展，广大群众送子女入学的要求日益迫切。当国家目前尚不可能举办更多的学校的时候，发动群众用集体力量解决自己子女入学问题，经验证明确实是一个好办法。虽然目前群众办的学校质量上还不能一致，但是总的来说，学生能上学总比不能上学好；多办几所学校多识几个字，总比少办几所学校少识几个字好。在这个问题上也存在着两条路线：一条是完全依赖国家包办，好高骛远，看不起民办；另一条是在国家兴办之下，走群众路线，大力提倡群众集体兴办。我们在工作中严肃批判了第一种指导思想，坚持了第二种指导思想，所以民办学校才迅速的发展起来了。
    可减少家庭负担
    第二，学生上学近，减少了家庭负担。民办学校在吸收学生时贯彻了就近入学的原则。不少地区建校时把公、私立学校统一作了规划。如新乡、商丘等专区乡乡有中学，许昌县中学，学生的家一般都在七、八华里以内，杞县、开封等六个学校的六百五十一个学生，有四百六十人的家离学校在五里地之内。学校离家近，学习、劳动都方便，也使学生的家庭减少了负担。
    教育同劳动密切结合
    第三，教育同劳动和实际能够密切结合。民办中学学生参加劳动的机会多、时间也长。在日常的劳动中就自然而然地培养了学生们的劳动观点，养成了劳动习惯。民办中学学生，在课余、星期六下午、星期天都要参加劳动，不少学生上学时带上粪筐。他们提出的口号是“忙了生产，闲了读书”。星期天如果村上没活作，他们仍坚持上课，生产忙时即放假参加劳动。商水县小张庄民办中学学生二十九人抗旱一周，挣了二千四百个工分；刘庄六十个学生参加十二天抢种，挣了八千个工分。该校女教师王爱荣，带着学生打井，晚上就睡在工地上，不仅提前完成了该社的打井任务，还鼓舞了妇女积极参加劳动的热情。西华道陵岗乡的群众看到学生劳动好，又能学文化，就给了该乡民办中学十亩实验田，收入归学校，借以帮助解决学校经费问题。实验园地在公立学校是长期没有很好解决的问题，而民办中学解决了。
    便于乡社对学校的领导
    第四，学校大多设在乡村，乡和社对学校领导方便。民办学校是由乡、社直接领导的，他们对于教师和学生的思想教育工作抓得很紧，很具体。乡和社的党、政负责人经常到学校去给学生们作报告，有的还经常访问学生家长，这样做能及时有效地解决了教师、学生和家长的思想问题。例如，西华道陵岗民办中学，开学后学生思想很混乱，说学校分民办和公立两部分，这是国家对学生不公平；嫌民办学校设备简陋，等等。这个学校的管理委员会，就领导学生采用大鸣、大放、大辩论的办法，发动学生辩论这些问题。最后学生们认识到上学是自己的事，国家不可能完全包下来，大家都安心学习了，教师们也表示一定要办好这个学校。
    为国家节省大量开支
    第五，给国家节省了大量开支。群众办学，可以说是绝大多数做到了勤俭办学。民办学校的校舍、校具等虽然还有少数是新建和新做的，但是一般的都注意了节约的原则。能不花钱就不花，能少花钱就少花。郑州郊区沟赵民办中学的二百元开办费，修理了十三间瓦房没用完，又做了一付篮球架，商水许村民办中学盖了六间校舍只花了七十元钱。公杂费学校掌握都很紧，仅限于开支粉笔、纸张等，每班最多的不超过八元。不少学校提倡学生上学“来回一把柴”，如商水许村、西华道陵岗等学校烤火、喝开水、学生馏馍用的烧柴都是这样解决的。学校没有图书费，就发动大家捐书，商水罗堂民办中学，舞阳民办的育民中学，搜集了二千多册书，成立了图书室，解决了学生课外阅读问题。学生们帮助农场割豆子、下地拣红芋，用劳动收入解决订报费用。有的学校还准备养鱼、养猪、种藕等，借副业生产的收入，来降低收费标准，减少学生的负担。
    民办中学有四大满意
    干部满意　家长满意　学生满意　教师满意
    四大满意是：
    第一，民办中学由乡、社直接领导，中心工作来了，容易抓，干部满意。民办学校能结合中心工作，并推动其他工作，是乡、社基层干部的很好的助手。民办中学的政治课有不少是由乡、社党组织书记担任的，教材内容也密切地结合了中心工作，农民做啥，学校教啥。中心工作一来，他们就先向学生作报告。这样教师和学生就变成了一支宣传大军，并能宣传政策。因此，干部把学校师生看成了工作中的可靠的助手。
    第二，学习不脱离生产，学费容易解决，家长满意。学生上民办学校，读了书，又不耽误生产，学费学生自己也可以解决，家长都很满意。
    第三，更多的学生有入学机会，学生满意。
    第四，一些早建立的学校给予了后建立的大力支持，减少了教学上的困难，教师满意。
    民办学校好处多，各方面又都感到满意，因而也就容易巩固下来。据我们调查，许昌专区的周口、商水、许昌、舞阳等县市的民办学校可以百分之百地巩固下来，新乡专区的民办学校也可达到百分之九十以上巩固下来。
    群众愿意办学校，群众也会办学校。中小学教育是关系群众切身利益的教育事业，脱离群众的支持是难以发展和提高的。我省群众办学的经验就证明了依靠社会和群众力量，采用多种多样的形式来办学校是完全可行的，而且效果也是很好的。我们把群众办学看成是今后相当长时期内，在教育事业上必须采取的方针。与工农业生产大跃进同时教育事业也来一个大跃进
    河南今年计划再发展民办小学学生三十万人，民办中学学生十八万人。
    现在来谈谈一些待解决的问题。
    民办学校是一项新的工作，我们的经验还不多，因而还有些问题，急待解决。例如，目前的学校还缺乏一些把学校办得更好的必要的制度；但这不是说去搞一套束缚民办学校发展的制度。有些人对培养学生的目标还不够清楚，总是同公立学校比设备，比条件；教师有的质量不够高；有的学校收费偏高；有些学校还有铺张浪费现象，等等。但是我们认为，只要加强领导，进一步贯彻民办学校的方针，认真地总结群众创造出来的先进经验，这些问题都是可以解决的。
    总之，中小学教育是普通教育，是地方性和群众性的文化教育事业。它的发展不应当脱离工农业生产的基础，又不能离开广大群众的帮助和支持。几年来，我省中小学教育在各级党组织和人民政府的正确领导和人民群众的大力支持下，已经有了很大的发展。但是，随着人民生活的逐步改善，群众送子女入学的越来越多，我省中小学教育的目前状况，无论从数量上或质量上说，都远不能满足群众的要求。同时国家在发展中小学教育事业方面，已尽了很大的努力，当前也不可能过多地增加经费来开办更多的学校。因此，必须贯彻执行群众办学的方针，提倡社会集团和群众举办学校，以补助国家办学的不足。我省于一九五八年度计划在现有的基础上再发展民办小学三十万人，民办中学十八万人，作为奋斗的目标。我们决心在一九五八年工农业生产大跃进的同时，在教育事业上也来一个大跃进。
    最后提一点建议：就是在一九五八年度国民经济计划草案中估计群众自办学校招生的人数，我们感觉少了。如估计民办初中学生可发展十八万人，前边已经说过，只河南就打算本年度在过去基础上再新发展十八万人，因此，建议国家有关部门适当增加群众办学的指标。
    各位代表！我的发言，如有不当之处，请批评指正！
