    Those with Potential Should Not Be Mobilized to Return Home
    This issue, I just can't understand it, and recently it has affected my mood even more, even diminishing my love for my children. When the children are naughty, I hate them, thinking that if I hadn't given birth to these little monkeys, I would have graduated from university by now. At the very least, I would be a section-level cadre, and I wouldn't be so far behind my classmates.
    I was originally studying at a military and political cadre school, but I was mobilized to return home because I was pregnant with my first child. Later, I went to the nursing school of Beijing Medical College for a year, but I had to drop out again because I gave birth to my second child. Later, when the children got a little older, I found a nanny, and I got away to work as a temporary primary school teacher. Until November 1956, I passed the entrance exam for the Beijing Local Industry Bureau Workers' School, graduated after half a year, and was assigned to the factory as a clerk. Although I only get a living allowance of 28 yuan a month, I don't think it's too little. On the contrary, I feel mentally happy and willing to serve the people wholeheartedly. Now that I have just given birth to my third child, I am very afraid of being mobilized to return home again. In fact, I have properly arranged for all three children: the oldest has just started school, the second is sent to kindergarten, and the third is sent to the nursing room. Some odd jobs around the house are taken care of by a young relative. My husband earns more than 80 yuan a month.
    I am only twenty-five years old, and I have some education. This is a great time to serve the country and the people. Although my work ability is a little poor, it can be gradually improved. Therefore, I disagree with resigning and returning home to participate in housework.
    I believe that female employees who have working conditions and hopes for further education, even if the work is not currently needed, should be given training as long as it will be needed in the future. If they are mobilized to return home, it is in conflict with the spirit of appropriately and vigorously training and promoting female cadres put forward by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
    If there are many children and no relatives to take care of them, the housework is heavy, they are older, and the work is not needed, then resigning and returning home to participate in housework is completely correct. However, some units discriminate against female employees, regardless of the circumstances, and as long as there are two or three children, they are listed as objects of mobilization for resignation, as an excuse to unload burdens. I think this practice is also incorrect.

    有培养前途的就不该动员回家
    这个问题，我也是搞不通的，近来更加影响我的情绪，甚至减少了对孩子的热爱。孩子们一淘气，我便恨起来，如果不生你们这些猴毛，我现在也大学毕业了。起码是一个科员级的干部了，至少不会太落在我的同学们的后面。
    我原在军政干部学校学习，因为怀第一个孩子，被动员回了家。后来到北京医学院护士学校读书一年，由于生第二个小孩，又只得退学。后来，孩子大了一点，找了个保姆，我脱身去当临时的小学教员。直到1956年11月，我考上北京地方工业局职工学校，半年毕业，被分配到厂里当办事员。虽然每月只得生活补助费二十八元，我倒不嫌少，反而感到精神愉快，愿意全心全意为人民服务。现在刚生第三个小孩，我很怕又被动员回家。其实，我已把三个孩子都妥善安排好了：大的刚上学，二的送幼儿园，三的送哺乳室。有些零星家务，有一个亲戚的小姑娘帮助我料理。我爱人每月工资八十多元。
    我才二十五岁，有点文化，正是为国家为人民效劳的大好时机，虽然工作能力差些，但是可以逐步提高的。所以，我不同意退职回家参加家务劳动。
    我认为女职员有工作条件、又有深造希望的，即使目前工作暂不需要，只要将来是需要的，就应给予培养。如果动员回家，是与中共第八次党代表大会所提出的适当的大力的培养和提拔女干部的精神是有抵触的。
    如果孩子多而无亲人料理，家务繁重，年岁较大，工作又不需要，那末退职回家参加家务劳动是完全正确的。可是有些单位歧视女职工，不分青红皂白，只要是有两三个小孩的，都列为动员退职的对象，作为卸包袱的借口，我认为这种作法也是不正确的。
