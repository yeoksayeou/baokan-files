　　Lanzhou to Liujiaxia Railway Survey Completed

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. The survey work for the railway from Lanzhou to Liujiaxia has been completed, and preliminary design is now underway based on the survey data collected from the field.

　　This railway is being built to serve the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. Preliminary calculations indicate that the railway line will be 37 kilometers long, requiring it to cross the Yellow River twice and pass through a relatively large number of tunnels, making the project quite arduous.

　　兰州到刘家峡铁路勘测完毕
    新华社兰州8日电　从兰州到刘家峡的铁路已经完成勘测工作，现在正根据从野外收集回来的勘测资料进行初步设计。
    这条铁路是为建设刘家峡水力发电站服务的。初步计算，铁路线长三十七公里，要两次跨过黄河，并通过较多的隧道，工程相当艰巨。
