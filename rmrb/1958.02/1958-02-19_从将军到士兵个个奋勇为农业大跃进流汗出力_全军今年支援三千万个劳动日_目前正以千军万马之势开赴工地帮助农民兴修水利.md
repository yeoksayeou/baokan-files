Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army will support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production with more than 30 million labor days in 1958. This figure is one-third more than in 1957.

The characteristics of the PLA's support for the agricultural Great Leap Forward this year are: well-planned, large-scale, enthusiastic, and fast-acting. Before the Spring Festival, all units generally formulated plans to support agricultural production that greatly exceeded those of previous years. Some units invited provincial leaders to participate in and guide the planning process, and proposed that the army would definitely do what the local areas needed the army to support. Some units also submitted the drafted plans to the local party committees for review and approval. Many battalion and company units have also established contact with the agricultural cooperatives where they are stationed, and have made plans to regularly help the agricultural cooperatives with labor. This year, the Zhejiang Military Region plans to support agricultural production with 2 million labor days. The Wuhan troops used a total of 1.3 million labor days to support agricultural production in 1956 and 1957, but this year they will complete 1.4 million labor days, which is 100,000 labor days more than the total of the previous two years. The Guangzhou troops plan to support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture with 4.3 million labor days this year, which is 1.62 million labor days more than last year.

In the upsurge of supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, from generals to soldiers, everyone takes pride in being able to participate in labor, and everyone strives to be the first. The Guangzhou troops are the most enthusiastic and the fastest to act. In mid-January, a large army had already set off for the construction sites to help local people build water conservancy projects. After the Spring Festival, they will have completed more than 3 million labor days. The troops stationed in Kunming have already done more than 56,000 labor days for the Changpo Reservoir, completing more than 68,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Troops stationed in Fuzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other regions are currently investing in the upsurge of supporting agricultural production with rapid action and full enthusiasm. Many troops did not take holidays or shortened their holidays during the Spring Festival and continued to work on various water conservancy project sites.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The labor force of 7,000 to 8,000 officers and soldiers from the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and units stationed in Beijing who participated in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, under the slogan of "No holidays, no stopping work, go all out to celebrate the Spring Festival," carried out tense labor on the construction site on the 18th – the first day of the Spring Festival – just like usual. Senior generals such as Vice Minister of National Defense Wang Shusheng also went to the construction site to participate in labor.

More than 2,000 officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Nanjing carried their tools to the Jin Chuan River and Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing on the morning of the 18th to dig mud. Commander Xu Shiyou, Lieutenant General Xiao Wangdong, Lieutenant General Yu Lijin and other leaders of the troops also went to the construction site to participate in digging mud for fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the southern provinces are vigorously supporting the farmland water conservancy construction movement with a force of thousands of troops. Since before and after the New Year, good news has been frequently reported from various water conservancy construction sites. It is really a large army going into battle, changing the landscape.

The more than 200 water conservancy projects participated in by the officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Guangzhou came to an end around the Spring Festival, and it is estimated that more than 3 million labor days will be completed. The troops stationed on Hainan Island participated in the construction of 43 water conservancy projects, and have completed more than 198,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. Thirteen projects have been completed, and the vast number of officers and soldiers are stepping up construction on 30 construction sites such as the Wushan Yong Reservoir. After all these projects are completed, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 123,000 mu, and the grain output can be increased by about 5 million jin. A certain unit of the troops stationed in Huiyang participated in the construction of 27 projects, and has completed more than 148,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Two reservoirs have been built. After all the projects are completed, 357,000 mu of paddy fields can be irrigated. The Zhanjiang troops and the masses jointly built eight projects, including the Xuwen Dashuiqiao Reservoir, most of which are about to be completed. Since December last year, the troops stationed in the Chaoshan area have participated in the construction of the Jieyang Xinxi River Reservoir, and later allocated 510,000 labor days to support 19 projects such as reservoir construction, dike removal, and soil improvement. Most of these projects have now been completed.

Most of the 65 water conservancy projects undertaken by the troops stationed in Hunan have been completed. The officers and soldiers participating in the construction of the Guanyinmiao Reservoir in Hengshan are working day and night to complete this permanent project that can irrigate 50,000 mu of farmland as soon as possible. The soldiers participating in the construction of the "August 1st Reservoir" and "Army-Civilian Reservoir" in Hengchang Township, Hengyang County, still used flashlights to dig into the rock layer at 12 o'clock in the night. They sang:
	"Not afraid of wind, not afraid of cold, black night as day, five days' task completed in three days." Under the shock construction of the officers and soldiers, these two reservoirs were completed in less than a month. From then on, the drought resistance capacity of this township has increased from 25 days to 70 days.

Every day, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers stationed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other places are vigorously supporting the masses in building reservoirs, dredging rivers and canals, and digging mud for fertilizer. The troops stationed in Nanjing worked day and night at the Huangma Reservoir construction site under Zijin Mountain for a month and a half, and have completed more than 37,000 cubic meters of earthwork. On February 10, the troops stationed in Shanghai completed the task of helping the suburbs to eliminate snails, build water conservancy projects, and accumulate fertilizer on time and ahead of schedule, digging a total of 715,000 cubic meters of soil, exceeding the original plan by 110,000 cubic meters. The completion of this task has increased the suburban agricultural cooperatives by more than 500,000 cubic meters of fertile mud, making more than 60,000 mu of farmland in the northern suburbs permanently free from water disasters, and will completely eradicate schistosomiasis in the western suburbs. Under the slogan of "No troops will be withdrawn when the ground is frozen three feet, and no work will be stopped when the snow falls three feet," the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Zhejiang garrison completed more than 25,000 cubic meters of earthwork in just over 20 days on the construction sites of two large reservoirs. They said that they must complete the project in time as a Spring Festival gift to the local people.

Since January, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers of the Kunming troops have brought their own tents, military horses, machinery and tools to various construction sites to build water conservancy projects. The officers and soldiers participating in the construction of the Changpo Reservoir in the suburbs of Kunming are working in three shifts day and night. They ensure that they will not leave the construction site during the Spring Festival. A certain unit of the troops stationed in Lincang is helping local ethnic minorities to build a large ditch that is 100 li long, which is being stepped up. After the completion of this ditch, it can irrigate the paddy fields of twelve agricultural cooperatives. In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the local troops are also vigorously helping farmers of all ethnic groups to build a 45-li-long canal and a reservoir that can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields.

    从将军到士兵个个奋勇为农业大跃进流汗出力
    全军今年支援三千万个劳动日
    目前正以千军万马之势开赴工地帮助农民兴修水利
    新华社18日讯　中国人民解放军在1958年内将以三千多万个劳动日支援农业生产大跃进。这个数字比1957年多三分之一。
    解放军各部队今年支援农业大跃进的特点是：规划好、声势大、劲头足、行动快。春节前夕，各部队都普遍制定了大大超过往年的全年支援农业生产的规划。有的部队在制定规划时请省的负责人参加指导，并且提出地方需要军队支援什么，军队一定办到。有的部队还把订出的规划交地方党委审核批准。许多部队的营连单位，也普遍和驻地农业社建立了联系，订出了经常帮助农业社劳动的计划。浙江军区今年计划以二百万个劳动日支援农业生产。武汉部队1956年和1957年支援农业生产共用了一百三十万个劳动日，今年却要完成一百四十万个劳动日，比以往两年的总和还多十万个劳动日。广州部队今年计划以四百三十万个劳动日支援农业大跃进，比去年多一百六十二万个劳动日。
    在支援农业大跃进的高潮中，从将军到士兵，人人都以能参加劳动为荣，个个争先。广州部队干劲最足、行动最快，在一月中旬千军万马就已开赴工地，帮助当地人民兴修水利。春节后，他们将要完成三百多万个劳动日。驻昆明部队已为长坡水库做了五万六千多个劳动日，完成六万八千多土方。福州、南京、北京、济南、沈阳、兰州、成都、内蒙古、新疆等地区驻军，目前都以快速的行动，充足的干劲，投入了支援农业生产高潮。许多部队在春节期间不休假或缩短假期，继续在各个水利工程工地上劳动。
    据新华社18日讯　解放军总部和驻北京部队各单位七、八千名官兵组成的参加修建十三陵水库的劳动大军，在“不休假，不停工，鼓足干劲过春节”的口号下，18日——春节的第一天和往日一样，在工地上进行了紧张的劳动，国防部副部长王树声大将等高级将领，也去工地参加了劳动。
    驻南京部队的二千多名官兵，在18日清晨，各自携带着工具分别到南京金川河、玄武湖挖泥。部队首长许世友上将、萧望东中将、余立金中将等也都到工地上参加挖泥积肥。
    新华社16日讯　解放军驻南方各省部队正以千军万马之势，大力支援农田水利建设运动。从新年前后以来，各个水利工地上捷报频传，真是大军上阵，河山变色。
    驻广州部队官兵参加修建的两百多项水利工程，到春节前后告一段落，估计将完成三百万个以上的劳动日。海南岛驻军参加修建的四十三项水利工程，已完成十九万八千多土石方，有十三项工程已经完工，广大官兵正在乌山涌水库等三十个工地上加紧施工。这些工程全部完成以后。可以扩大灌溉面积十二万三千多亩，增产粮食约五百万斤。惠阳驻军某部参加修建的二十七项工程，已经完成十四万八千多土方，有两座水库已经建成；全部工程完成以后，可以灌溉三十五万七千多亩稻田。湛江驻军和群众共同修建的徐闻大水桥水库等八项工程，大部分即将完工。潮汕地区驻军从去年12月份起，就参加揭阳新西河水库的修建工程，后来又拨出五十一万个劳动日支援修水库、移堤、改良土壤等十九项工程。目前这些工程已经大部分完成。
    湖南驻军担负的六十五项水利工程，大部分已经完工。参加建设衡山关王庙水库的官兵，为了提早完成这项能灌田五万亩的永久性工程，正在日夜赶工。参加修建衡阳县衡常乡“八一水库”和“军民水库”的战士们，在深夜十二点还用手电照着开凿石层，他们唱着：
  “不怕风，不怕寒，黑夜当白天，五天任务三天完。”在官兵们的突击施工下，不到一个月，这两座水库都已完工。从此，这个乡的抗旱能力由二十五天提高到了七十天。
    江苏、浙江、上海等地驻军每天都有成千上万的官兵在大力支援群众修建水库、疏浚河渠、挖泥积肥。南京驻军在紫金山下的黄马水库工地上，夜以继日地劳动了一个半月，已经完成三万七千多土方。上海驻军在2月10日已按时并超额完成了帮助郊区灭钉螺、兴修水利、积肥的任务，共挖土七十一万五千方，超过原定计划十一万方。这一任务的完成，使郊区农业社增加了五十多万方的肥泥，使北郊六万多亩田地永不受水灾之害，并将使西郊区彻底根绝血吸虫病。浙江驻军某部官兵在“地冻三尺不收兵、雪下三尺不停工”的口号下，仅二十多天就在两个大型水库工地上完成了两万五千多土方，他们表示一定要及时完工，作为给驻地群众的春节献礼。
    昆明部队成千上万的官兵从1月起就自带账篷、军马、机械和工具，分赴各个工地兴修水利。参加修建昆明市郊长坡水库的官兵们正在日夜三班地轮流施工，他们保证春节不下工地。临沧地区驻军某部帮助当地少数民族修筑的一条长达一百华里的大水沟，正在加紧施工。这条水沟完工后，可以灌溉十二个农业社的水田。在德宏傣族景颇族自治州，当地驻军也在大力帮助各族农民修建长达四十五华里的水渠和可灌溉一万多亩水田的水库。
