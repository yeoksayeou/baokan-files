Spring Festival Gift - Downed a Chiang Kai-shek Plane
    Xue Qingpu Liu Yihao

    As we welcome the first Spring Festival of the Second Five-Year Plan, the soldiers of a naval aviation unit on the Shandong Peninsula are guarding the motherland's airspace with extra vigilance.

    Early in the morning, firecrackers echoed from villages and towns near and far. The soldiers deeply understand that the more it is a time of celebration and national rejoicing, the more vigilant we must be against enemy harassment. Sure enough, around ten o'clock in the morning, a Chiang Kai-shek RB-57 twin-engine jet aircraft took off from Taoyuan base in Taiwan. It was captured by our radar troops when it was still in the deep sea far from the mainland. On the radar screen, it could be seen that it was sneaking north along the southeast sea of our country.

    All duty personnel were vigilantly watching the changes in the enemy's situation in their respective positions. The duty aircraft group on the take-off line was waiting for the order to take off and meet the enemy. The enemy plane entered the Yellow Sea and suddenly changed course, scurrying straight towards Lianyungang. Obviously, the enemy was trying to sneak into the Jiaodong coastal area from high altitude and at high speed.

    Lieutenant Hu Chunsheng and his wingman, Second Lieutenant Shu Jicheng, accepted the order to intercept the enemy. Two silver swallows rushed into the sky like arrows from a bow, chasing towards the direction of the enemy plane.

    "××, turn left and climb higher."

    "The enemy plane is twelve kilometers ahead to your left, pay attention to searching!"

    The guiding voice of the ground command post came continuously from the radio. Hu Chunsheng became more calm and excited. He thought of today being the Spring Festival, and of the expectations of his superiors, and couldn't help but widen his eyes. In an instant, at an altitude of more than 14,000 meters to the left front, he spotted a black dot like a sparrow: it was the enemy plane! He looked at the instruments again, and they were already in the stratosphere at an altitude of more than 15,000 meters. He reported to the ground command post while calling his wingman, increased the throttle, and rushed straight towards the rapidly flying enemy.

    "××, hit them hard, blast them into smithereens in the air!"

    The ground commander's decisive order added strength to Hu Chunsheng. He skillfully maneuvered the plane, cleverly approaching the enemy plane, two thousand meters, one thousand meters...

    Shu Jicheng reminded his flight leader:
    "Attention, adjust the sight!"

    Hu Chunsheng opened fire. At high altitude, the vibration force was great, and the first shot missed. He immediately turned the nose of the plane, bit the enemy plane again, and waited until it entered the ideal firing range, and the enemy plane's projection filled the entire ring, before he slammed down the cannon button. Shells drilled into the Chiang Kai-shek plane's right engine, left wing root, and tail, and the enemy plane rose with circles of thick smoke, sliding downwards. Hu Chunsheng rushed forward and fired again from three hundred meters. When he disengaged, he was only seventy meters away from the enemy!

    The wingman Shu Jicheng had already been unable to suppress his anger. Seeing that the enemy plane had not yet exploded, after receiving the flight leader's order to attack, he pulled the plane up, then skillfully inverted it, and fired a few shells at the enemy. The stubborn enemy was still struggling in the sky. He was not willing to give up, thinking that he would crash the enemy into the sea even if he had to ram it. He followed up and added a few more shells, only to see a large chunk of the enemy plane's right wing shattered by the shells. He quickly flipped over and dodged, and the enemy plane, trailing a stream of thick smoke, plunged straight into the rolling waves.

    春节献礼——打下了一架蒋机
    薛清浦　刘义豪
    当我们迎来第二个五年计划的第一个春节的时刻，山东半岛的海军航空兵某部战士们，格外警惕地守卫着祖国的海空。
    清晨，远近村庄、城镇，鞭炮声频传。战士们深深懂得，愈是逢年过节、举国欢腾的时候，就愈要警惕敌人的骚扰。果然，上午十时左右，蒋军一架RB—57型双发动机喷气式飞机，从台湾桃源基地起飞了。当它还在距大陆很远的深海里，就已被我雷达兵捕捉到了，在雷达萤光屏上，可以看出它正沿着祖国东南海面向北偷窜。
    各种值勤人员在自己的岗位上，警觉地注意敌情的变化，起机线上的值班机群，在等待起飞迎敌的命令。敌机进入黄海海面，突然改变航向，直朝我连云港方面窜来。很明显，敌人妄图从高空，以大速度窜犯胶东沿海地方。
    胡春生中尉和他的僚机舒积成少尉，接受了拦截敌人的命令后，两只银燕像脱弦的箭一样，驰向天空，向敌机所在方向追扑过去。
    “××，向左转弯，爬高。”
    “敌机就在你左前方十二公里处，注意搜索！”
    无线电里，接连传来地面指挥所引导的声音。胡春生更加沉着、振奋，他想到今天是春节，想到首长的期望，不觉瞪大了眼睛。一瞬间，在左前方一万四千多公尺处，发现一个像麻雀样的黑点：是敌机！他再看仪表，已经在一万五千公尺以上的同温层高空了。他一面向地面指挥所报告，一面招呼僚机，加大油门，向疾飞的敌人直扑而去。
    “××，狠狠的打，打它个空中开花！”
    地面指挥员果断的命令，给胡春生增加了力量，他灵巧地操纵飞机，巧妙地向敌机逼近，二千公尺，一千公尺……
    舒积成提醒自己的长机说：
      “注意，调整瞄准具！”
    胡春生开炮了，在高空，震动力大，第一次射击落空了。他马上扭转机头，再咬住敌机，直等进入到理想的射击距离，敌机投影占满了整个光环，才猛地一按炮钮。炮弹钻进了蒋机右发动机、左翼根和尾部，敌机腾起了一圈圈浓烟，向下滑落。胡春生赶上前去，从三百公尺处再开炮射击，等他脱离时，距敌人只有七十公尺了！
    僚机舒积成早已压不住满腔怒火，见敌机还没有爆炸，得到了长机命令攻击后，便把飞机拉了上去，接着就巧妙地反扣下来，对着敌人“砰砰”几炮。顽强的敌人，仍在天空中挣扎。他那肯甘休，心想我撞也要把你撞下海去，跟上去又补了几炮，只见敌机右翼被炮弹打得崩裂一大块。他急翻身闪过去，敌机拖着一股浓烟，直栽进了滚滚的波浪里。
