    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 25th. The United States Senate passed a bill proposed by the government on the 24th, deciding to increase the US national debt limit by 5 billion US dollars: from 275 billion US dollars to 280 billion US dollars. Previously, the House of Representatives had already passed this bill.
    The current amount of US government debt has reached as high as 274 billion US dollars. The reason it is requesting a further increase in the national debt limit is that huge military expenditures have made the financial situation very tight, and it therefore intends to continue borrowing heavily. After Congress passed the government's bill, the Treasury Department has decided to announce the issuance of 1.5 billion US dollars in new bonds on the 25th.

    填补军费开支的无底洞
    美国会通过提高国债限额
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院24日通过政府提出的一项法案，决定把美国国债限额提高五十亿美元：从二千七百五十亿美元提高到二千八百亿美元。在这以前，众议院已经通过了这个法案。
    美国政府目前的国债数目已高达二千七百四十多亿美元。它所以要求进一步提高国债限额，是因为庞大的军费开支使财政情况十分拮据，因而打算继续大量举债。在国会通过政府的法案后，财政部已经决定在25日宣布发行十五亿美元的新债券。
