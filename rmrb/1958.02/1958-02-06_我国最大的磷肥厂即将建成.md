　　China's Largest Phosphate Fertilizer Plant to Be Completed Soon

　　(Our newspaper dispatch) China's first large-scale, new-type phosphate fertilizer plant – the state-owned Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant – will be completed in June of this year.

　　At present, the civil engineering work has been basically completed. The equipment for a production system with an annual output of 200,000 tons of powdered fertilizer has been installed and will begin trial operation by the end of February. The equipment for a production system with an annual output of 200,000 tons of granular fertilizer began installation in the fourth quarter of last year and will be completed and put into production by the end of June this year.

　　This plant was designed by Chinese designers under the direct guidance of Soviet experts. The plant is designed to produce 400,000 tons of ordinary superphosphate per year. (Zhang Guozheng)
