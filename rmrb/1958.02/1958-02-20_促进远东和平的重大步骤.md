Our government delegation, led by Premier Zhou Enlai, paid a visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the invitation of the Korean government and held sincere and friendly talks with the Korean government delegation. After the talks, the two sides issued a joint statement and reached complete agreement on expanding and developing the friendly relations between the two countries, strengthening the friendly unity of socialist countries, the current international situation, and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. During this meeting, the two sides focused on exchanging views on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The two sides agreed that the proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its statement on February 5 were timely and realistic in the current international situation, reflecting the national aspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Based on its consistent position of actively promoting the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Chinese government, in addition to fully supporting the Korean government's proposals in its statement on February 7, has now, after consultation with the Korean government, proposed to the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea on its own initiative. The Chinese People's Volunteers have fully agreed to this proposal of the Chinese government and have decided to withdraw all of their troops from Korea in batches before the end of this year. The decision of the Korean and Chinese sides to withdraw all the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is a proactive and major measure to seek to break the current stalemate in Korea created by the United States, promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and strive for further easing of the tense situation in the Far East.

The visit of our government delegation to Korea and the talks with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea undoubtedly have great significance for further strengthening the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. The friendship between our two peoples has been tested by long-term joint struggles against aggression. Especially in the war against American imperialist aggression, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese and Korean people have further consolidated and developed this traditional friendship with their blood. The Korean people's defeat of American aggression not only defended the independence of their motherland, but also guaranteed China's security. In the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, the Chinese people have also more deeply recognized the relationship of interdependence and shared destiny between the two countries. In recent years, in order to promote their respective socialist construction, our two countries have carried out extensive cooperation in the fields of economy, culture, science, and technology, providing each other with brotherly assistance and learning from each other. The friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, as the joint statement says, "not only conform to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but are also based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding national equality and proletarian internationalism," and are therefore eternal and unbreakable.

Our two countries are members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and like other socialist countries, we have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and have consistently advocated that the Korean issue should and must be resolved through peaceful means; the peaceful reunification of Korea should and must be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The Chinese people's decision to form a volunteer army to go abroad and fight alongside the Korean people was an act of forbearance, forced upon us when the American aggressors ignored the warnings of the Chinese people, crossed the 38th parallel in a big way, pressed to the Yalu River, and occupied our territory of Taiwan, threatening our security, and were left with no choice but to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and defend our country. After the American aggressor troops were repeatedly defeated on the Korean battlefield and finally had to agree to a truce, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, made unremitting efforts to maintain the stability of the truce and strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is an undeniable fact. Now, in response to the Korean government's proposal, the Chinese government has proposed to withdraw all the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, and has obtained the consent of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This proactive and positive measure once again fully demonstrates the utmost sincerity of the Korean and Chinese sides in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and easing tensions in the Far East.

The Chinese people's decision to withdraw their volunteer army from Korea is primarily aimed at promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea. As everyone knows, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a prerequisite for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Because only when all foreign troops withdraw from Korea can the Korean people resolve their own problems through consultations without foreign interference, which is an extremely obvious principle. In the years since the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly advocated the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. This reasonable proposition has not been realized due to the stubborn opposition of the US authorities. Now, the international situation has undergone changes that are favorable to the cause of peace, and the forces of peace and socialism have surpassed the forces of war and imperialism on a global scale. The peaceful foreign policy of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is increasingly gaining popularity, while the US imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation is becoming increasingly unpopular. The United States' arbitrary and hegemonic rule in Western Europe has undergone profound changes, and the differences between the United States and its allies are becoming increasingly acute. The call for peaceful consultations between East and West is becoming increasingly loud. The United States is becoming increasingly discredited in the eyes of the people of the Middle East and Asia, and the struggle of the people of Eastern countries for independence and peace is on the rise. The US imperialist position is becoming increasingly isolated, and the difficulty for it to launch wars of aggression is increasing. In such an unprecedentedly favorable international environment, the decision to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is completely timely. The Chinese people have always cherished peace. In the past, sending their volunteer army to Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea was for peace, and now proactively withdrawing the volunteer army from Korea is also for peace, in order to promote the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. If the United States and other countries participating in the "United Nations forces" have a minimum of sincerity for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, after the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to withdraw all their troops from Korea, they have no reason not to take similar measures to withdraw all their troops from South Korea. We know that some countries other than the United States participating in the "United Nations forces" have not always held a rigid attitude towards the issue of troop withdrawal. The question now is whether the United States still wants to go its own way. After the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to withdraw all their troops from Korea, if the US authorities still want to go their own way and refuse to withdraw their aggressor troops from South Korea, it can only further show that they are afraid of peace, and can only further show that they are deliberately obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, which will inevitably make the aggressive face of the United States more thoroughly exposed, and make it more isolated in front of the peace-loving people of the world.

The proactive measure of withdrawing all the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is a manifestation of the full confidence of the Korean and Chinese people in maintaining the cause of peace. The three-year Korean War has proved that the Korean and Chinese people who bravely fight to resist aggression and defend their homes and defend their country are invincible. Today, the Korean and Chinese sides have resolutely decided to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea while the American aggressor troops are still occupying South Korea. This shows that the Korean and Chinese people are full of confidence in their own strength. If the US government and the Syngman Rhee clique regard the great actions of the Korean and Chinese sides to promote peace as a sign of weakness, then they will once again make a huge misjudgment. The joint statement pointed out: "The people of the world will no longer allow imperialism to launch new wars. The Korean people's strength to resist aggression is also stronger than ever before. The Chinese and Korean people have inseparable interests. The Chinese people have never ignored any infringement by imperialism on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the past, and will never ignore it in the future." If imperialism thinks there is an opportunity to take advantage of and dares to take the risk of launching a new adventure, it will inevitably taste the crushing counterattack of the Korean and Chinese people once again, and suffer unimaginable consequences.

The current international situation is very conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. While deciding to withdraw all the volunteers from Korea, the Chinese people sincerely hope and will continue to actively support the efforts of the Korean people and government so that the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully at an early date, and the Korean people's national aspiration for peaceful reunification of their motherland can be realized at an early date. All countries and people who care about the Korean situation and peace in the Far East should, in this favorable new situation, rise up to support the just actions of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland, urge the early withdrawal of the US aggressor troops from Korea, and promote the realization of peaceful reunification in Korea, thereby further easing the tense situation in the Far East.

### 促进远东和平的重大步骤

    促进远东和平的重大步骤
    由周恩来总理率领的我国政府代表团，在应邀访问朝鲜民主主义人民共和国期间，同朝鲜政府代表团举行了诚挚友好的会谈。会谈后，双方发表联合声明，就扩大和发展两国的友好关系、加强社会主义国家的友好团结、目前国际形势和和平解决朝鲜问题，取得了完全一致的看法。在这次会谈中，双方着重就一切外国军队撤出南北朝鲜和和平解决朝鲜问题交换了意见。双方一致认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在2月5日声明中提出的各项建议，在目前国际形势下是适时和现实的，它反映了朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的民族愿望。中国政府本着一贯积极促进朝鲜问题和平解决的立场，除了在2月7日的声明中完全支持朝鲜政府的各项建议以外，现在在同朝鲜政府协商以后，又向中国人民志愿军提出了主动撤出朝鲜的建议。中国人民志愿军已经完全同意中国政府的这一建议，并且决定在今年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜。朝中方面决定从朝鲜全部撤出中国人民志愿军，是谋求打开美国目前在朝鲜所造成的僵持局面、推动朝鲜问题的和平解决、并为争取进一步缓和远东紧张局势的主动的重大的措施。
    我国政府代表团的访问朝鲜和同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的会谈，毫无疑问，对于进一步加强中国人民和朝鲜人民的传统的友谊，有着重大的意义。我们两国人民的友谊经受过长期的反抗侵略的共同斗争的考验，特别是在反对美帝国主义的侵略战争中，中朝人民的优秀儿女用鲜血更加巩固和发展了这种传统友谊。朝鲜人民打败美国的侵略，不仅捍卫了自己祖国的独立，同时也保障了中国的安全。中国人民在伟大的抗美援朝、保家卫国的斗争中，也更深切地认识了两国之间唇齿相依、安危与共的关系。近几年来，为了促进各自的社会主义建设，我们两国在经济、文化、科学、技术等方面展开了广泛的合作，互相给予兄弟般的援助，并且互相学习。我们两国的友好合作关系，正如联合声明所说，“不仅符合于和平共处的五项原则，而且是以马克思列宁主义关于民族平等和无产阶级国际主义的原则为基础的”，因此它是永恒的和牢不可破的。
    我们两国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员。我们两国，和其他社会主义国家一样，一贯奉行和平外交政策，一贯主张朝鲜问题应该而且必须通过和平途径加以解决；朝鲜的和平统一，应该而且必须由朝鲜人民自己解决。中国人民组成志愿军出国同朝鲜人民并肩作战，是在美国侵略者不顾中国人民的警告，大举越过“三八线”，进逼鸭绿江边，并侵占我国领土台湾，威胁到我国安全的情况下，忍无可忍，被迫起而抗美援朝，卫国保家。当美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上屡战屡败，终于不得不被迫同意停战之后，中国人民志愿军又同朝鲜人民军一道，为维护停战的稳定和争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，作了不懈的努力。这是有目共睹的事实。现在，中国政府响应朝鲜政府的建议，提出从朝鲜全部撤出中国人民志愿军，并且已经得到中国人民志愿军的同意。这一主动的积极措施，再一次充分表明了朝中方面谋求和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和远东紧张局势的最大诚意。
    中国人民决定把自己的志愿军撤出朝鲜，首先是为的促使朝鲜的和平统一。谁都知道，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，是实现朝鲜和平统一的先决条件。因为只有一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，朝鲜人民才能够在不受外来干涉的条件下，通过协商的途径，自己解决自己的问题，这是极为明显的道理。在朝鲜停战以来的几年中，朝中方面就一再主张所有外国军队全部撤离朝鲜。这个合理的主张，由于美国当局的顽固反对而一直未能实现。现在，国际形势已经发生了有利于和平事业的变化，和平和社会主义的力量在世界范围内超过了战争和帝国主义的力量。以苏联为首的社会主义国家的和平外交政策愈来愈深入人心，而美帝国主义的扩军备战政策则愈来愈不得人心。美国在西欧独断专横的统治地位已经发生深刻的动摇，美国同它的盟国之间的分歧正愈来愈尖锐。要求东西方和平协商的呼声正愈来愈响亮。美国在中近东和亚洲各国人民的心目中，愈来愈声名狼籍，东方各国人民为独立和和平的斗争正在高涨。美帝国主义的处境日益孤立，它要发动侵略战争的困难日益增大。在这样的空前有利的国际形势下，决定从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军是完全适时的。中国人民一贯酷爱和平。过去派遣自己的志愿军到朝鲜去抗美援朝是为了和平，现在主动地从朝鲜撤退志愿军也是为了和平，为了促使一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退。美国和参加“联合国军”的其他国家，如果对于和平解决朝鲜问题具有起码的诚意，在中国人民志愿军决定全部撤出朝鲜之后，就没有理由不同样采取措施把它们的军队全部撤出南朝鲜。我们知道，参加“联合国军”的美国以外的其他一些国家，对于撤军问题并不是始终抱着僵硬的态度的，现在的问题是美国是否仍旧要一意孤行。在中国人民志愿军决定全部撤出朝鲜之后，美国当局如果仍然想一意孤行，不肯从南朝鲜撤出它的侵略军，那只能更加说明它害怕和平，只能更加说明它蓄意阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，这必然使美国的侵略面目更加彻底暴露，而在全世界和平人民面前更加陷于孤立。
    从朝鲜全部撤出中国人民志愿军这一主动措施，是朝中人民对于维护和平事业具有充分信心的表现。三年的朝鲜战争已经证明，为反抗侵略、卫国保家而英勇战斗的朝中人民是不可战胜的。今天，朝中方面在美国侵略军仍然侵占南朝鲜的情况下，毅然决定从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军，这正说明了朝中人民对于自己的力量满怀信心。如果美国政府和李承晚集团把朝中方面促进和平的伟大行动看作是软弱的表现，那末它们就会再一次犯极大的估计错误。联合声明指出：“现在全世界的人民更不容许帝国主义发动新的战争。朝鲜人民反抗侵略的力量也已经比过去任何时候更为强大。中国人民和朝鲜人民有着休戚相关的利益，帝国主义对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的任何侵犯，中国人民过去没有，今后也绝对不会置之不理。”帝国主义如果以为有机可乘，敢于冒天下之大不韪，发动新的冒险行动，那末必然再一次尝到朝中人民的粉碎性的还击，遭到不堪设想的后果。
    目前国际的形势十分有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决。中国人民在决定从朝鲜全部撤出志愿军的同时，衷心地希望并且将继续积极支持朝鲜人民和政府的努力，使得朝鲜问题能够早日和平解决，朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的民族愿望能够早日实现。关心朝鲜局势和远东和平的一切国家和人民，都应该在这样有利的新形势下，起来支持朝鲜人民和平统一自己的祖国的正义行动，促使美国侵略军队早日撤出朝鲜，促进朝鲜和平统一得以实现，从而使远东的紧张局势得到进一步的缓和。
