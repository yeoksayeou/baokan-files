　　State-owned Farms and Ranches to Reclaim More Than Twice the Area Opened Since Liberation During the Second Five-Year Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The area of wasteland to be reclaimed by state-owned farms and ranches during the Second Five-Year Plan will be more than twice the total area of wasteland reclaimed by state-owned farms and ranches since the nationwide liberation.
    Minister of State Farms and Land Reclamation Wang Zhen delivered a report today to the representatives attending the First National Congress of the China Agricultural and Water Conservancy Trade Union. In his report, he elaborated on the work of running farms diligently and thriftily and actively developing the wasteland production of state-owned agriculture and animal husbandry. He said that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the state will invest 2 billion yuan in reclaiming wasteland and building state-owned farms and ranches. The state-stipulated wasteland reclamation target is 40 million mu, but in the great leap forward in national agricultural production, the employees of state-owned agricultural enterprises must also achieve a great leap forward in production, and strive to complete the task of reclaiming 60 million mu of wasteland. The total grain output (cumulative) should strive to reach 41 billion jin, the total cotton output should reach 14.4 million dan, and at the same time, animal husbandry and agricultural product processing should be greatly developed.
    National state-owned farms have already made great achievements in the work of reclaiming wasteland, and the scale of reclamation is expanding year by year. From 1949 to 1952, the cumulative reclamation was 4 million mu in four years, from 1953 to 1955, the cumulative reclamation was 4.46 million mu in three years, and the area of reclamation in 1956 and 1957 each reached more than 4 million mu.
    Wang Zhen said that according to estimates from surveys over the past few years, there are 1.5 billion mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed in our country, of which 800 million mu have been surveyed and prospected, and 500 million mu of the 800 million mu are relatively easy to reclaim. These wastelands are mostly concentrated in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and western Sichuan Province.
    Wang Zhen said that state-owned farms and ranches are the highest organizational form of agricultural and animal husbandry production in socialist society. This form of ownership is a superior force for highly developing agricultural and animal husbandry productivity, especially for reclaiming large wasteland plains, large wasteland mountainous areas, and beaches. He said that by the end of the First Five-Year Plan, 710 state-owned farms and ranches mainly engaged in grain, cotton, animal husbandry, rubber, fruit trees, vegetables, etc. (excluding farms in special districts and counties) have been established throughout the country, with a total of 18 million mu of cultivated land, 420,000 employees, and nearly 10,000 standard tractors (15 horsepower each), as well as many trucks, agricultural machinery, livestock, agricultural product processing equipment, and so on. During the First Five-Year Plan, it also produced 4 billion jin of grain, 480 million jin of soybeans, and 940,000 dan of ginned cotton for the country. In addition, it has also made great achievements in cultivating and supplying improved varieties to agricultural cooperatives, improving cultivation techniques, and creating large-scale, high-yield experience. According to incomplete statistics, 23 state-owned farms across the country have already reached the targets of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin of grain per mu ten years ahead of schedule, and 47 farms have reached the target of 60 jin or more of cotton per mu, of which 4 farms have reached 100 jin per mu, and some high-yield fields have even reached 1,600 jin of unginned cotton per mu. However, on the whole, the grain output of state-owned farms and ranches is still relatively low. In order to strive to achieve the targets stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule, the employees of state-owned agricultural enterprises across the country need to make a leap in terms of political ideology, management policy, and technical measures, so that the advanced will become more advanced, and the temporarily backward farms will catch up quickly and catch up with the production level of the advanced farms.
    Wang Zhen said that in the rectification movement, the situation of large organizational structures and excessive non-production personnel in state-owned farms and ranches in various places has been greatly changed. He said that at present, after the work of cadres going to lower levels and streamlining institutions, the number of management personnel in state-owned farms and ranches in various places has generally been reduced to below 2%, which is of great significance for training cadres and improving field and farm production. In his report, Wang Zhen also called on state-owned farms and ranches across the country to resolutely implement the policy of combining production and construction and running enterprises diligently and thriftily in production and construction; and he encouraged the representatives attending the meeting to make greater contributions to the country's socialist construction in their future work.

### 国营农牧场在第二个五年计划内  开荒面积将超过解放以来的两倍

　　国营农牧场在第二个五年计划内
    开荒面积将超过解放以来的两倍
    新华社30日讯　我国国营农牧场在第二个五年计划中开垦荒地的面积，将超过全国解放以来国营农牧场全部开荒面积的二倍。
    农垦部部长王震今天向出席中国农业水利工会第一次全国代表大会代表作了报告。他在报告中就勤俭办农场和积极发展国营农牧业的开荒生产工作作了详细的阐述。他说，在第二个五年计划中，国家用于开垦荒地建设国营农牧场的投资将有二十亿元，国家规定的开荒指标是四千万亩，但是在全国农业生产大跃进中，国营农业企业的职工也要来一个生产大跃进，努力争取完成开垦六千万亩荒地的任务。粮食总产量（累计数）要争取达到四百一十亿斤，棉花总产量要达到一千四百四十万担，同时，还要大大发展畜牧业和农产品加工业。
    全国国营农场在开垦荒地的工作上已经取得了很大的成绩，垦荒的规模是逐年扩大的，从1949年到1952年四年累计开荒为四百万亩，1953年到1955年三年累计开荒为四百四十六万亩，而1956年和1957年每年开荒的面积都达四百万亩以上。
    王震说，根据几年来的调查估计我国可以开垦的荒地，有十五亿亩，其中经过调查勘察的有八亿亩，八亿亩中比较容易开垦的有五亿亩。这些荒地大都集中在黑龙江、内蒙古、青海、新疆以及四川省西部。
    王震说，国营农牧场是社会主义社会中农牧业生产的最高组织形式，这种所有制形式，是高度发展农牧业生产力，尤其是开垦大荒原、大荒山区和海滩的一种优越力量。他说，到第一个五年计划期末，全国各地已经建立起七百一十个以经营谷物、棉花、畜牧、橡胶、果树、蔬菜等为主的国营农牧场（不包括专区和县的农场），共有耕地一千八百万亩，职工四十二万人，拖拉机近一万标准台（每台十五马力），还有许多载重汽车、农业机具、牲畜、农产品加工设备等等。在第一个五年计划期间，还为国家生产了四十亿斤粮食，四亿八千万斤大豆和九十四万担皮棉，此外，在培育、供应农业社良种、改进栽培技术和创造大面积高额丰产经验等方面也取得了很大成绩。据不完全统计，现在全国已有二十三个国营农场提前十年达到了粮食亩产四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标，有四十七个农场达到了棉花亩产六十斤以上的指标，其中有四个农场达到亩产一百斤，有部分丰产田并且达到亩产子棉一千六百斤。但是，整个看来，国营农牧场粮食的产量还是比较低的，为了争取提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案规定的指标，全国国营农业企业的职工需要从政治思想，经营方针和技术措施等方面来个飞跃的提高，使先进的更加先进，暂时落后的农场急起直追，迅速赶上先进农场的生产水平。
    王震说，在整风运动中，各地国营农牧场组织机构庞大、非生产人员过多的情况已有很大改变，他说目前各地国营农牧场经过干部下放和精简机构工作，管理人员一般都已经降到2％以下，这对培养锻炼干部和改进田农牧场生产都有很大意义。王震在报告中，还号召全国国营农牧场在生产建设中，要坚决贯彻执行边生产边建设、勤俭办企业的方针；他并且勉励出席这个会议的代表，在今后的工作中为祖国的社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
