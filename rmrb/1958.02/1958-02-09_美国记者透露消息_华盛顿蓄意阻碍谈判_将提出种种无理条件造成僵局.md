Xinhua News Agency, February 7th dispatch from New York (TASS): American newspapers and magazines have made all sorts of speculations and arguments about the issues that Bulganin proposed to Eisenhower in his letter that should be discussed at the East-West summit, while at the same time advocating the discussion of other issues with various possible restrictions. This shows that the American ruling group is fundamentally unwilling to engage in serious negotiations.

An Associated Press reporter said that the United States firmly insists that "the German question must be a major issue at any meeting between East and West." However, this reporter completely ignored that discussing the German question without the participation of representatives from both Germanys is unimaginable.

Some reporters say that the United States will advocate establishing control over outer space, that is, advocate banning intercontinental ballistic missiles, while evading discussion of the issue of banning nuclear weapons. As can be seen from the commentary in the "Washington Post and Times Herald," the purpose of the American ruling group in proposing this issue is: "to shift the responsibility for saying 'no' from the United States to the Soviet Union." This newspaper believes that if negotiations cannot be avoided, then one should try to blame the failure of the negotiations on the Soviet Union.

The "New York Herald Tribune" particularly opposes the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. It wrote that Secretary of State Dulles and many others believe that this proposal is "a plan to undermine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and create a vacuum in Europe by disarming Germany." At the same time, this newspaper believes that the proposal to expand trade implies "giving up control over strategic goods."

This newspaper also bluntly stated that some people in the United States still intend to bring up the issue of "liberating Eastern Europe" for discussion. However, commentator Lippmann of this newspaper admitted that "no serious person would think that negotiations could be conducted on this position." He believes that "this is actually a dead-end policy implemented in a divided and occupied Europe."

　　美国记者透露消息
    华盛顿蓄意阻碍谈判
    将提出种种无理条件造成僵局
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约6日讯：美国的报纸和杂志对布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信中所提出的应该在东西方最高级会议上讨论的问题作出了各种各样的臆测和论证，同时主张讨论另外一些伴有各种可能的限制条件的问题，这就表明了美国统治集团根本不愿意进行认真的谈判。
    美联社记者说，美国坚决主张，“在东西方之间的任何会议上，德国问题都必须是一个主要的问题”。但是，这个记者完全忽略了，如果没有两个德国的代表参加，讨论德国问题是一件不可想像的事情。
    有些记者说，美国将主张建立对宇宙空间的控制，即主张禁止洲际弹道火箭，同时却规避讨论禁止核武器问题。从“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”的评论中可以看出，美国统治集团打算提出这个问题的目的是：“把说‘不行’这个字的责任由美国卸给苏联”。这家报纸认为，如果不能避免谈判的话，那就应该设法把谈判的失败归罪于苏联。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”特别反对在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。它写道，国务卿杜勒斯以及很多其他人士认为这个建议是“破坏北大西洋公约组织和用解除德国的武装的方法在欧洲建立真空的计划”。这家报纸同时认为，关于扩大贸易的建议是意味着“放弃对战略货物的控制”。
    这家报纸还露骨地表示，在美国有人还有把“解放东欧”的问题提出来讨论的意图。但是，这家报纸的评论员李普曼承认：“没有一个认真的人会认为在这种立场上可以进行谈判”。他认为：“这实际上是在被分割和被占领的欧洲实行的一种死胡同政策”。
