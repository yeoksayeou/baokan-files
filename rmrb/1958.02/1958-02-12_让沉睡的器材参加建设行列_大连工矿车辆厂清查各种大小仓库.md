Let Dormant Equipment Participate in Construction
Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory Checks All Kinds of Warehouses

(Reported by Luda Daily) A factory-wide movement to thoroughly check warehouses has been launched at the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory.

This factory has many large and small, open and not-so-open warehouses. The entire factory has a general material warehouse, a parts warehouse, and a tool warehouse; each workshop also has its own material warehouse, semi-finished product warehouse, and tool warehouse. Many departments, such as the laboratory and the power room, also have their own warehouses – these are all open. In addition, there are countless unofficial small warehouses among many workers. A large amount of material is overstocked in these warehouses, hiding huge waste. After the anti-waste movement began, this factory launched a mass inspection of these warehouses. For some open warehouses, they adopted a method of combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. On the one hand, leaders verified the amount of overstock from the accounts, and on the other hand, the masses made disclosures and criticisms. For the small warehouses among the workers, the workers were mobilized to consciously hand over the accumulated materials to the workshop while exposing wasteful phenomena.

The investigation revealed that the phenomenon of material overstocking in this factory was very serious. Last year, all factories felt that the supply of coke was insufficient, but this factory overstocked more than 1,400 tons of coke. According to statistics, in the tool warehouse, there were 192 pieces of tools that exceeded the reserve and were not needed by the factory at all, worth more than 42,800 yuan. Although the laboratory is not a large department, the situation of material overstocking in the warehouse is very alarming. The imported drug potassium iodate can be used for forty or fifty years; more than forty bottles of sodium fluoride are overstocked and are not needed at all now. Some precision instruments ordered from abroad, such as hardness testers, oil analyzers, and photometers, are also overstocked in the warehouse because too many were purchased and they cannot be used. Each of these instruments is worth at least several thousand yuan. The phenomenon of material overstocking in the small warehouses of the workers is also very serious. Workers in just four groups in the tool workshop cleaned out 130 kilograms of tools from their small warehouses, worth 1,170 yuan, including many precision gauge blocks, milling cutters, etc. According to statistics from the finance section, this factory has overstocked a total of more than 2.78 million yuan in raw materials, auxiliary materials, fuel, and tools, exceeding the quota. Paying interest to the bank alone costs more than 160,000 yuan per year.

The investigation also found that due to overstocking and poor management, many materials deteriorated and were lost. More than nine tons of welding rods (worth more than 1,000 yuan per ton) in the material warehouse have all deteriorated and cannot be used, and more than six tons of automatic welding wire are rusted. Many parts were lost in the general parts warehouse, including more than 1,500 pieces of finished products and rough castings of sixty tons of tippers alone.

Why did such serious overstocking and waste occur? According to the masses' disclosures, blindly purchasing under the influence of the idea of "having it in reserve just in case" is an important reason for the overstocking. For example, when the purchasing staff saw a gauge block attachment on the market, they "estimated it could be used" and bought it back, resulting in an overstock of seven sets, each set worth 400 yuan. The overstocking of some equipment in the laboratory is caused by the idea of preferring the new and disliking the old. For example, there was already an oil analyzer that could be used, but they disliked it for being old and bought another one. However, the oil analysis project has not yet been established. Disregarding policies and rushing to purchase goods in short supply is another important reason for the overstocking in this factory. When coke was in short supply last year, this factory sent five or six people to Shanxi at high prices to rush to purchase 3,000 tons of coke, but they could not use it all, resulting in an overstock of 1,400 tons. The colorimeter overstocked in the laboratory was bought in order to spend money when other instruments could not be bought and if the money was not spent it would have to be handed over. However, because there was already one, the newly purchased one could not be used and had to be stored in the warehouse.

    让沉睡的器材参加建设行列
    大连工矿车辆厂清查各种大小仓库
    本报讯　据旅大日报报道：大连工矿车辆厂掀起了全面清查仓库的运动。
    这个工厂有许多大大小小的、公开的和不公开的仓库。全厂有总的材料库、零件库、工具库，各个车间还有各自的材料库、半成品库和工具库，许多科室如试验室、动力室等也都有自己的仓库，这些都是公开的；另外，在许多工人中还有无数的不公开的小仓库。在这些仓库中超定额积压着大量的物资，隐藏着巨大的浪费。反浪费运动开始后，这个工厂就对这些仓库展开了群众性的清查工作。对一些公开的仓库，他们采取了上下结合的方法，一方面由领导从账上核算积压的数字，另一方面由群众进行揭发和批评。对工人中的小仓库，便发动工人在揭发浪费现象的同时，自觉地把积存物资交到车间。
    清查中发现，这个工厂积压物资的现象是十分严重的。去年各厂都感到焦炭供应不足，但是这个厂却积压了一千四百多吨焦炭。据统计，在工具库里面，积压着的超过储备量和本厂根本用不上的工具就有一百九十二件，价值四万二千八百多元。试验室虽然是个不大的部门，但是仓库中积压物资的情况十分惊人。进口药品碘酸钾可以使用四、五十年；氟化钠积压了四十多瓶，现在根本用不上。一些由国外订购的精密仪器，如硬度计、油脂分析器、光度计等，也都由于买多了用不上而积压在库里。这些仪器每台至少都值数千元。工人中的小仓库积压物资现象也很严重。工具车间仅四个小组的工人就从小仓库中清理出一百三十公斤工具，价值一千一百七十元，其中有许多精密的卡板、铣刀等。据财务科的统计，这个工厂在原材料、辅助材料、燃料、工具等四方面一共超定额积压资金二百七十八万余元。只是向银行付利息全年就得十六万多元。
    清查中还发现，由于积压和管理不善，许多材料变质了，丢失了。材料仓库中的九吨多电焊条（每吨价值一千多元），全都变质不能使用，六吨多的自动电焊条丝生了锈。零件总库有许多零件丢失了，其中只六十吨翻车的成品和毛坯就丢失了一千五百多件。
    为什么会造成这样严重的积压和浪费呢？据群众揭发，在有备无患的思想支配下盲目进行采购，是造成积压的重要原因。如采购员看到市场上有块规附件，“估计能用”，就买回来，结果积压了七组，每组价值四百元。试验室有些设备所以积压是喜新厌旧思想造成的。如油脂分析器，本来有一台，也能用，但是嫌年久了，就又买了一台。可是油脂分析项目到现在还没有建立起来。不顾政策地抢购缺货，是这个工厂造成积压的另一个重要原因。在去年焦炭缺少的时候，这个工厂出高价派了五、六个人到山西去抢购了三千吨焦炭，结果用不了，积压了一千四百吨。试验室积压的比色计，是在买别的仪器买不到、而如果不买钱要上缴的情况下，为了花钱才买来的。但是因为原来有了一台，新买的用不上，只得压在仓库里。
