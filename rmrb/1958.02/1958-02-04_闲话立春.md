　　A Casual Chat About the Beginning of Spring
　　Zuo Huan
    Today (the sixteenth day of the twelfth lunar month) is the Beginning of Spring, which is also the start of spring agricultural labor. This morning, the "Fang Star" in the sky appeared due south. In ancient times, people would see the Fang Star in the morning and go to plow the fields and turn the soil, beginning agricultural labor. Therefore, this star was also called "Agricultural Auspice."
    To symbolize spring plowing, in some places in the past, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, people would use soil to make male and female idols, two of each, holding hoes, standing beside an ox made of soil, so that people could contemplate the objects and attach importance to labor. In some places, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, before dawn, a green flag was erected outside the door to show the welcoming of spring. Because "green" symbolizes the revival of the earth and the rejuvenation of all things.
    Since the Han Dynasty, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, women often wore spring hair ornaments, spring wins, which were small flags cut from green silk or paper, stacked in layers of more than a dozen, connected together, and worn on the head. Some were also cut into the shapes of spring swallows, spring butterflies, etc. In short, they all expressed that "spring" has come! In some ancient poems and lyrics, we often see descriptions of hairpin spring banners and wearing spring swallows, such as Jiaxuan's lyrics: "Spring has returned, see the graceful spring banners on the beauty's head." In some places, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, spring chickens and spring swallows were made with feathers and silk, and spring flowers and spring willows were sold on the streets. Wanqiu Yayan's spring lyrics: "The snow has not completely melted on the Xiaoyue Tower, and the spring message is transmitted by the sudden breaking of the waxing wind. Colorful chickens and silk swallows, pearl banners and jade wins, all return to the hairpin temples." This is what it refers to.
    In the past, the diet on the day of the Beginning of Spring was also different from usual. On this day, spring platters were eaten. The food in the spring platter varies from saying to saying. According to the records of various books, it is nothing more than celery sprouts, leek yellows, radishes, artemisia, spring bamboo shoots, and other raw vegetables and spring pancakes. In the Jin Dynasty, there was even a custom of giving spring platters, most of which were radishes and celery sprouts. Because they were raw vegetables, they could not be eaten too much, only to take the meaning of welcoming the new. After the Tang and Song Dynasties, the custom of making spring cakes and spring platters became even more popular, and some literati often improvised poems, describing the shape and color of spring platters. Families with gardens would also display flower platters on the day of the Beginning of Spring, which is probably similar to today's flower baskets.

　　闲话立春
　　左宦
    今天（农历十二月十六）是立春，立春又是春季农业劳动的开端。在今天早晨，天上的“房星”出现在正南。古时人们在早晨看见房星便去耕地翻土，开始农业劳动，因此这颗星又叫“农祥”。
    为了象征春耕，在立春日，过去有的地方用土作成男女偶像各二人，手持锄头，站在用土作成的牛的旁边，使人们睹物思义，重视劳动。也有的地方在立春日天未亮时，要立一面青色旗子在门外，以示迎接春天。因为“青”象征着大地回春，万物苏生。
    自汉以来，立春这天妇女多戴春旛、春胜，就是用青色绸子或纸剪作小幡模样，重重叠叠十几个，连在一起，戴在头上。也有剪成春燕、春蝶等形状的，总之都是在表示着“春”来了！在一些古诗词中，我们也常看到形容簪春幡、戴春燕之类的句子，如稼轩词：“春已归来，看美人头上袅袅春幡”。还有的地方，立春日用羽毛和绸子作春鸡、春燕，街上有卖春花和春柳的。万俟雅言春词：“晓月楼头未雪尽，乍破腊风传春信。彩鸡缕燕，珠旛玉胜，并归钗鬓。”就是指此而言。
    从前，立春日的饮食也与平日不同，这天要吃春盘。春盘内的食品其说不一，综合各书所记，不外芹芽、韭黄、萝卜、蒿子、春笋，以及其他生菜和春饼等。晋时更有馈送春盘的风俗，其中大多是萝卜、芹芽之类，因系生菜，不可多吃，只取迎新之意而已。到唐宋以后，作春饼、春盘之风更盛，一些文人墨客常即席吟咏，描写春盘形色。有花园的人家，在立春日还要摆出花盘来，这大概与今日的鲜花篮相似了。
