　　Xinhua News Agency, February 9th, Moscow Dispatch via TASS: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has issued a letter to all voters regarding the upcoming election of the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to be held on March 16th. The letter to voters points out that, as in the past, in the upcoming election, the Communist Party will form a united alliance with non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The CPC Central Committee calls on all voters to unanimously vote for the candidates proposed by this alliance.

　　The letter to voters points out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will continue to dedicate itself to strengthening and consolidating the great and lofty cause of defending peace. The Party believes that its primary internationalist duty is to tirelessly expand its ties with great China and all socialist countries. The Communist Party declares that it will continue to tirelessly care for the consolidation of socialist countries, further develop Soviet democracy, and educate the people in the spirit of patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

　　The letter to voters says that caring for the satisfaction of the Soviet people's growing material and spiritual needs will continue to be the main direction of the efforts of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union. The Party will unremittingly struggle to further develop the economic, scientific, and cultural sectors, and to solve the Soviet Union's main economic task, namely, to catch up with and surpass the largest capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production.

　　The letter to voters points out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, representing the fundamental interests of the people, has consistently pursued a policy of peace. Based on its sincere desire to ease international tensions, the Soviet Union has reduced its armed forces by a total of 2.14 million people in the past three years. This is a practical embodiment of the Leninist policy of peace. The letter to voters says: Neither in the past nor now has the Soviet Union ever used force against other countries to impose its own system and ideology on others, because doing so is contrary to the nature of socialist countries and the Soviet Constitution. We firmly and sincerely declare that we are willing to coexist peacefully and amicably with all countries in a lasting and consolidated environment of peace. The Soviets advocate peaceful coexistence between the two systems because they believe that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system.

　　The letter to voters continues by saying that, whether in the past or now, the Communist Party has always been concerned about the consolidation and development of socialist countries and socialist democracy. Only socialist democracy can open up infinitely broad space for the development of the talents and wisdom of millions of ordinary people. The rulers of the Western world, who have established systems of enslavement in their own countries, talk glibly about "pure democracy." "Pure democracy" under the capitalist system is a deception, and bourgeois ideologists and reformists use this deception to conceal the dictatorship of monopoly capital. Under the guise of this "democracy," they have committed and are still committing the most appalling crimes against humanity.

　　The letter to voters points out that in the four years since the last election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, many measures have been taken in the Soviet Union to improve the welfare of the people, such as: improving preferential treatment and support, ceasing the issuance of public bonds, abolishing many kinds of taxes, raising wages, shortening working hours, and so on. All of this has promoted the increase of the actual wages of workers and staff and the income of collective farmers. The housing problem in the Soviet Union is also being successfully resolved. For example, this year will see the construction of housing with a total area of 61 million square meters. Collective farmers and rural intellectuals will build 800,000 houses.

　　The letter to voters lists many materials illustrating the achievements made by the Soviet Union in the development of industry, agriculture, science, and culture over the past four years. The letter to voters points out that in the past four years, the Soviet Union has built more than 3,000 large industrial enterprises, several large-scale hydroelectric power stations, including the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. The production of steel, the mining of coal and oil, the production of electricity, and the production of daily necessities and food have all greatly increased. Thanks to the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, the 1957 industrial production plan was greatly overfulfilled.

　　In these four years, the Soviet people and the younger generation have reclaimed 36 million hectares of wasteland, wheat production has increased by 40%, and cattle have increased by nearly 11 million head. At present, the Soviet Union's milk production has reached 95% of the level of the United States, and the Soviet Union's production of fats and oils has already exceeded that of the United States.

　　In the field of science and technology, Soviet scientists and engineers have built the world's first atomic power plant, produced the latest jet aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and made great discoveries in electronics and remote control mechanics. They launched two artificial earth satellites, thus making outstanding contributions to world science.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 9th, Moscow Dispatch via TASS: The Soviet Union's election campaign has entered a new stage. On the 8th, many electoral districts across the country convened pre-election meetings to discuss the nomination of candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet. At the meetings in various electoral districts, participants all approved of those who had been nominated as candidates for deputies to the highest organs of power. Representatives from all walks of life requested that the candidates for deputies accept the votes of the voters in the district where they were nominated.

　　Moscow announced on the 8th an open letter from members and alternate members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the election committees in charge of the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　The letter pointed out that members and alternate members of the Presidium had received many letters and telegrams from various electoral districts nominating them as candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. However, given that each candidate for deputy can only be elected in one electoral district, they have each agreed to accept the nomination of one electoral district as its candidate for deputy.

　　苏共中央发表告全体选民书
    号召选举党与非党联盟候选人
    苏共中央主席团成员接受各选区提名
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会就将在3月16日举行第五届苏联最高苏维埃选举事发表了告全体选民书。告选民书指出，和过去一样，在即将举行的选举中，共产党将同非党工人、农民和知识分子结成统一的联盟。苏共中央号召全体选民一致投票选举这个联盟所提出的候选人。
    告选民书指出，苏联共产党今后仍将致力于加强和巩固保卫和平这一伟大的崇高事业。党认为自己首要的国际主义职责是，不倦地扩大同伟大的中国、同所有社会主义国家的联系。共产党声明，它今后仍将不倦地关怀巩固社会主义国家，进一步发扬苏维埃民主，并且以爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义精神教育人民群众。
    告选民书说，关心满足苏联人民日益增长的物质和精神需求，今后仍将是苏联共产党和政府努力的主要方向。党将坚持不懈地奋斗，以争取进一步发展经济、科学和文化部门，争取解决苏联的主要经济任务，即在按人口平均计算的产品生产方面赶上和超过最大的资本主义国家。
    告选民书指出，代表人民根本利益的苏联共产党一贯执行和平政策。苏联从缓和国际紧张局势的真诚愿望出发，最近三年来裁减了武装部队共二百一十四万人。这是列宁主义的和平政策的实际体现。告选民书说：无论过去或现在，苏联从来都不对其他国家采取武力，来把自己的制度和意识形态强加给别人，因为这样做是违背社会主义国家的本质和苏联宪法的。我们坚决而真诚地宣布，我们愿意同一切国家在持久和巩固的和平环境中友好共处。苏联人主张两个制度和平共处，因为他们相信社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。
    告选民书接着说，无论过去或现在，共产党都经常关怀社会主义国家和社会主义民主的巩固和发展。只有社会主义民主才能为千百万普通人的天才和智慧的发展开辟无限广阔的天地。在本国建立起奴役制度的西方世界的统治者们侈谈什么“纯粹的民主”。资本主义制度下的“纯粹的民主”是欺骗，资产阶级的思想家和改良主义者用这种欺骗的手段来掩饰垄断资本的专政。在这种“民主”的幌子下他们对人类干下了、而且还在干着最骇人听闻的罪行。
    告选民书指出，在上届苏联最高苏维埃选举以来的四年中，苏联国内采取了许多旨在提高人民福利的措施，如：改进优抚赡养、停止发行公债、取消许多种捐税、提高工资、缩短工作日等等。所有这一切都促进了职工的实际工资和集体农民收入的增加。苏联的住宅问题也正在顺利地解决中。例如，今年将建筑总面积为六千一百万平方公尺的住宅。集体农民和农村知识分子将建筑八十万幢住房。
    告选民书列举了许多材料，说明四年来苏联在发展工业、农业、科学和文化方面所取得的成就。告选民书指出，四年来苏联建成了三千多个大工业企业，几个大规模的水电站，其中包括世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站。钢铁产量、煤和石油的开采量、电力的生产、日用品和食品的生产都大大增加了。由于实现了对工业和建筑业管理的改组，1957年工业生产计划大大超额完成了。
    在这四年中，苏联人民和青年一代开垦了三千六百万公顷的荒地，小麦生产增加40％，牛差不多增加了一千一百万头。目前，苏联的牛奶产量已经达到美国水平的95％，而苏联油脂的生产已经超过了美国。
    在科学技术方面，苏联科学家和工程师建立了世界上第一个原子能发电站，制成最新式的喷气飞机、洲际弹道火箭，在电子学和遥控机械学方面也有了巨大的发现。他们发射了两个人造地球卫星，从而对世界科学作出了卓越的贡献。
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的选举运动已经进入了新的阶段，8日，国内很多选区召开了选区的选前会议，讨论最高苏维埃代表候选人的提名问题。在各选区的会议上，参加者都赞成那些被提名为最高政权机关的代表候选人。各界代表要求代表候选人接受他们被提名的那个区的选民的投票。
    莫斯科在8日公布了苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员和候补委员给负责苏联最高苏维埃选举事宜的各区选举委员会的一封公开信。
    信中指出，主席团委员和候补委员收到了许多选区提名他们作苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的信件和电报。但是，鉴于每个代表候选人只能在一个选区受选，因此他们分别同意接受一个选区的提名，作为它的代表候选人。
