Wuhan, February 22nd: To ensure that Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace is put into production ahead of schedule on October 1st, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have made special decisions. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Party Committee has also put forward the slogan "Strive for seven months to produce iron, strive for three years to complete the plant", setting off a construction upsurge on the construction site.

To guarantee that Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace produces iron ahead of schedule on October 1st, two problems must be solved: First, equipment and materials must be supplied according to the advanced schedule. Second, leaders must thoroughly change their ideology and work style, go deep into the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Therefore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has listed the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction project as the top priority, giving first priority to the materials needed by Wuhan Iron and Steel. For the foreign equipment needed by Wuhan Iron and Steel, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has asked the State Economic Commission to supply it according to the advanced schedule. The domestic equipment needed by Wuhan Iron and Steel has been negotiated with the First Ministry of Machine Building to resolve. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a special instruction to ensure the early completion of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace, requiring all cadres of Wuhan Iron and Steel to mobilize urgently, requiring all units to continue to vigorously support Wuhan Iron and Steel, and deciding to establish the Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Headquarters, with Liu Jisun, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, and Wang Kewen, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, serving as the commander and deputy commander, responsible for supporting the work of Wuhan Iron and Steel. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Party Committee has sent nearly 400 workers to Macheng and Hong'an to learn their drive and leadership experience, to organize cadres to thoroughly change their ideology and work style, to go deep into the front lines to solve problems, and to go deep into the masses to implement "eating, living, and laboring together." The Wuhan Iron and Steel Party Committee has also formulated a construction plan for No. 1 blast furnace, requiring the entire party and all employees to strengthen the overall concept, subordinate everything to the construction of the blast furnace and coke oven, and subordinate everything to construction. They also decided to strengthen the construction force of No. 1 blast furnace, increasing it from the original one construction site to three construction sites working simultaneously. Regarding the most serious equipment problem at present, on the one hand, they are organizing the masses to clean up warehouses and tap potential, and on the other hand, they are sending working groups to factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiangtan and other places to discuss the supply of equipment according to the advanced schedule.

Now, a massive production upsurge has been set off at the construction site of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace and No. 1 coke oven, and a five-level plan has been formulated. The civil engineering project, which was originally required to be completed in July, is guaranteed by the civil engineering workers to be completed two months ahead of schedule, withdrawing from the site in May. Many workers have also consciously put forward the action slogans "Work hard in heavy rain, work extra hard in light rain, make up for half a day on days without rain", "Seize sunny days, rush on cloudy days, treat light rain as good weather, and make one night equal to daytime." The 140 pillars of the No. 1 blast furnace material bin trestle, originally planned to install one every two and a half work shifts and would not be completed until the end of February, were installed one per shift by Liu Fuyou's mixed work team, completing the installation two days before the Spring Festival. Zhao Songlin, a scaffolder, and Ding Dexing, a riveter, could only assemble four rings of the hot blast stove shell in two shifts, but now they assemble three rings in one shift, increasing work efficiency by 50%. Now, 19 rings of the blast furnace body have been installed, and three more rings are to be installed. Its three hot blast stoves and large chimney have reached the design elevation, and the quality meets the standards. Mechanical installation, electrical installation, pipeline, and furnace construction and other professional workers have all entered the site to carry out comprehensive cross-operation construction. More than a dozen construction units have also launched a collaborative competition, creating construction conditions for each other and cooperating with each other.

To ensure the supply of coke and gas to the blast furnace, more than 70 projects are under construction at the coking and chemical plant at the same time. The furnace construction workers of No. 1 coke oven also decided to complete the 90-day furnace construction plan in 75 days, ensuring that coke production starts on September 1st.

    苦战七月　高炉出铁　苦战三年　全厂建成
    武钢掀起规模浩大的建设高潮
    本报武汉22日电　为了确保武钢一号高炉提前在10月1日投入生产，冶金工业部和中共湖北省委已专门作出决定，武钢党委也提出了
  “苦战七月，高炉出铁；苦战三年，全厂建成”的口号，在工地上掀起了建设高潮。
    为了保证武钢一号高炉提前在10月1日出铁，必须解决两个问题：一是设备、材料按提前的日期供应；一是领导彻底转变思想作风，深入群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性。因此，冶金工业部已把武钢建设工程列为第一位，对武钢所需要的材料首先满足；对武钢所需要的国外设备，冶金部已请国家经济委员会按提前的期限供应；武钢所需要的国内设备，已与第一机械部商定解决。中共湖北省委最近专门发出保证武钢一号高炉提前建成的指示，除了要求武钢全体干部紧急动员起来外，要求各单位继续大力支援武钢，并决定成立武钢建设指挥部，由湖北省副省长刘济荪和武汉市副市长王克文担任正副指挥长，负责支援武钢的工作。武钢党委根据省委指示，已派遣了近四百名职工去麻城、红安学干劲，学领导经验，组织干部彻底转变思想作风，深入到现场去解决问题，深入到群众中去实行“同吃、同住、同劳动”。武钢党委还制订了一号高炉的施工规划，要求全党、全体职工加强整体观念，一切服从于高炉、焦炉建设，一切服从于施工。他们还决定加强一号高炉的施工力量，由原来一个工地负责增加为三个工地同时施工。对当前最严重的设备问题，他们一方面组织群众清理仓库，挖掘潜力，一方面派工作组分别去北京、天津、太原、沈阳、大连、哈尔滨、上海、广州、湘潭等地的工厂，商议按提前工期供应设备。
    现在，武钢一号高炉工地和一号焦炉工地上，已掀起了规模浩大的生产高潮，并制订了五级规划。原来要求在7月份完工的土建工程，土建工人保证提前两月建成，在5月份退出场地。许多工人还自觉地提出“大雨小干，小雨大干，不下雨顶一天半”“抓晴天，抢阴天，麻分细雨当好天，一个夜晚顶白天”的行动口号。一号高炉料仓栈桥的一百四十根柱子，原计划二个半工安一根，要到2月底才能安完，刘福友混合工作队却设法做到一个工一根，春节前两天就安装完毕。架子工赵松林和铆工丁德兴原来两班的时间只能拼装四圈热风炉壳，现在一班就拼装了三圈，提高工效50％。现在，高炉炉体已安装了十九圈，还有三圈就安装完毕。它的三座热风炉和大烟囱已达到设计标高，质量合乎标准。机装、电装、管道和筑炉等专业工人都已进入现场，进行全面交叉作业施工。十几个施工单位还展开了协作竞赛，互相创造施工条件，互相配合。
    为了保证供应高炉的焦炭和煤气，炼焦化工厂有七十多个项目同时施工。一号焦炉的筑炉工人还决定用七十五天完成九十天的筑炉计划，确保9月1日开始出焦。
