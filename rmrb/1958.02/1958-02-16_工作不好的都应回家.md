    I believe that having many children is not the main reason for female workers to resign and return home to do housework. Instead, a comprehensive consideration should be given based on their work performance, work needs, and whether children affect their work. We used to have a comrade in charge of documents who was already a mother of seven children. She was shrewd, capable, thrifty, simple, meticulous, and responsible in her work. Not only did she manage the housework in an orderly manner, and the children were all healthy and lively, but she also completed her work excellently. For a female worker with many children like this, what reason do we have to ask her to resign and return home to do housework? Conversely, I know a female comrade who works in a university library. She is also very shrewd, well-educated, and in excellent economic condition (her husband is a lecturer). She only has two children, but she is always late, leaves early, or is absent without reason because of her children or housework. Her work often has errors, and she is very arrogant and delicate, and her relationship with the masses is not good. In my opinion, this comrade should resign and return home to temper herself through housework.

### 工作不好的都应回家

    工作不好的都应回家
    我认为子女多不是女职工退职回家从事家务劳动的主要理由，还是应该从本人工作表现、工作需要以及是否因子女而影响工作等方面加以全面考虑为宜。我们这里过去有一位管文件的同志，已是七个孩子的妈妈了。她精明干练、勤俭朴素、工作细致负责，不仅把家务管理得井井有条，孩子们个个健壮活泼，而且把工作完成得很出色。像这样一位多子女的女职工，我们有什么理由让她退职回家从事家务劳动呢？相反地，我认识的一位在某大学图书馆工作的女同志，她也很精明，受过高等教育，经济条件很优越（爱人是讲师），仅有两个孩子，却老是因孩子或家务事而迟到早退、无故不到，工作经常出差错，而且傲劲很大，娇气十足，群众关系不好。像这位同志，我看倒应该退职回家，到家务劳动中去锻炼。
