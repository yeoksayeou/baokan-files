I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the current international situation and our country's foreign policy. I also agree with and support the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and suggest that the congress approve them.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo mentioned in his report that "in order to expand the textile industry, we must fully utilize various fiber resources." I would now like to talk about some situations and existing problems in this regard:

	More Detailed Investigation of Wild Hemp Production

(I) Existing textile fiber resources. In addition to a large amount of cotton, our country also produces a wide variety of hemp. In addition to the approximately four to five million dan of ramie, flax, flaxseed, and sesame cultivated artificially, there are also various types of wild hemp.

	1. Since the discovery of red wild hemp (i.e., Luo Bu Ma) in the saline-alkali wasteland of Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu in 1952, which was proven by the Central Textile Department to be a good textile raw material, in 1957, a large number of red wild hemp were also successively discovered in about 4 million mu of saline-alkali wasteland in six counties in Shandong, including Guangrao and Lijin. This hemp is locally called "tea stalk" because its leaves can be used as tea, hence the name. These leaves can also be used to feed cattle and sheep. Dezhou in Shandong also has this hemp. Recently, more than 100,000 jin of red hemp have also been found in Binhai County, Jiangsu. Furthermore, wild red hemp is also found in the saline-alkali wasteland of provinces such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei. The amount discovered so far is about two to three million dan nationwide. If these wild hemp are utilized, it is equivalent to more than one million dan of cotton.

	Red wild hemp is strong in nature and is a perennial plant. It is not afraid of cold and hot climate changes and can resist saline-alkali soil, so it can grow independently in saline-alkali wasteland, and artificial cultivation is also relatively easy. Because it does not occupy arable land, it does not compete with cotton and grain for land. Our country has a large amount of saline-alkali wasteland, estimated to be at least 100 million mu. If red hemp is planted on these wasteland, the same effect as reclaiming wasteland for cotton cultivation can be achieved without investing a large amount of capital, because each mu of red hemp can also produce 50 to 100 jin of spinnable fiber. Therefore, red hemp is indeed one of the most promising varieties for increasing textile raw materials in the future.

	2. In 1957, mountain foot hemp was also discovered, growing wild in the mountainous areas of Fujian. The fiber is slender, approximately equal to 60-70 count fine wool. The tensile strength is four times that of cotton. Its quality is better than ramie, and the price is only one-third of ramie. Its production situation and output are currently under investigation.

	3. Hubei Province has a great enthusiasm for finding wild fibers, and more than a dozen types were found in 1957. These fibers can all be used for papermaking. Among them, wild ramie (i.e., ramie) is not planted by anyone, but grows on its own. More than 40,000 dan were found in Hubei Province alone. In addition, nearly 10,000 dan of sugar hemp were also found. Furthermore, stinging nettle and gorgeous hemp were discovered in Northeast China in 1953, and gorgeous hemp was also found in Sichuan in 1957. The fiber of stinging nettle is longer and slightly thicker than ramie; the fiber of gorgeous hemp is approximately equal to cotton, but its strength is four times that of cotton.

	It is hoped that relevant departments will conduct a more detailed investigation of the output of these wild hemp. Our motherland is vast and rich in resources, and the reserves of spinnable fibers must be very large, and they still need to be continuously discovered.

	Better Utilization of Existing Fibers

(II) Experimentation and Utilization of Hemp Fiber. The Textile Department has been leading the experimental research on various spinnable hemp fibers since 1950. It has explored a set of usable methods and machinery and equipment in degumming. With these preparations, the new fibers found by various provinces can be identified and test-spun and applied immediately. Among the fiber resources listed above, some are long fibers, such as ramie, stinging nettle, mountain foot hemp, and part of red wild hemp, which can be purely spun or blended on silk spinning machines or wool spinning machines; after the raw hemp is cut short and degummed, it can also be blended on cotton spinning machines. However, for sesame, flax, flaxseed, flax waste, gorgeous hemp, and sugar hemp, because their single fibers are shorter, they can be processed as follows: (1) Blend with cotton using cotton spinning machines;
    (2) Pure hemp yarn can also be spun on coarse wool spinning machines.

	From 1950 to 1953, a lot of trial manufacturing work was done on ramie. In terms of clothing and other daily necessities, there are various colored clothing fabrics, socks, mosquito net cloth, towels, tablecloths, bed sheets, etc. spun purely from ramie; there are also various colored clothing fabrics blended or interwoven with silk, wool, rayon, and cotton. These small batches of trial products have been exhibited abroad many times. In terms of industrial products, there are canvas, conveyor belts, spindle tapes, etc. spun purely from ramie.

	Ramie textiles that are officially produced, such as those produced by Shanghai No. 9 State-owned Cotton Mill and Guangdong Ramie Textile Factory, include water hoses, shoe sewing thread, and various linen fabrics.

	Over the past few years, the above two factories have made some achievements in improving quality and reducing costs.

	According to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, under the leadership of the Textile Department, cotton-ramie blending work began in Shanghai in 1954 using ramie and red wild hemp. This is a new thing. After three years of experimental work, certain achievements have been made, but some problems still exist, such as more yarn breakage in the spinning of fine yarn and poor strength. We believe that these shortcomings will be overcome in the long run. In 1957, due to insufficient raw cotton, various provinces and cities and various enterprise departments tried their best to find resources to increase production. Tianjin No. 4 and No. 6 State-owned Cotton Mills used flax waste for cotton-ramie blending in order to increase production and save money, spinning coarse and medium count yarn and weaving canvas, which achieved very good results and gained experience. Shanghai No. 9 State-owned Cotton Mill used ramie long fiber spinning waste short fiber for cotton-ramie blending, which also increased production and accumulated experience. Hubei Province used the lowest grade ramie (the sorting waste of exported ramie), which was degummed in Shanghai, and spun it into medium count cotton-ramie blended yarn in Shashi Yarn Factory, weaving nearly a hundred kinds of fabrics, such as towels, bed sheets, and various colored printed fabrics, which attracted the attention of the leadership. In order to quickly and fully utilize various wild fibers and low-grade ramie, ramie velvet, wild ramie, red wild hemp, and sesame, a ramie refining plant with a daily output of 2 to 8 tons is being actively prepared. Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Tianjin and other places are preparing to start cotton-ramie blending this year. The Guangdong's new ramie textile factory with 20,000 spindles and Hunan's Zhuzhou ramie textile factory with 5,000 spindles will be put into production successively this year and next year.

	Two Suggestions

(III) Two problems currently existing:

	1. The problem of peeling red wild hemp. The areas that produce red wild hemp are mostly sparsely populated with little labor. If manual hemp peeling is used, the price is too expensive. For example, in Xinjiang, the wage is two yuan per person per day, and one person can only peel two or three jin. In order to quickly enable this abundant textile raw material to be utilized as soon as possible, it is recommended that the central government designate relevant departments to be responsible for researching and trial-producing this hemp peeling machine.

	2. In the textile department, ramie has often been in short supply in recent years, causing difficulties in production. It is hoped that the agricultural department will increase ramie production under possible conditions. At the same time, it is also hoped that relevant departments will consider allocating more ramie to the textile department under possible conditions this year to facilitate the development of the ramie textile industry.

	Listening to the speeches of the representatives made me feel extremely excited and encouraged. I am an old intellectual and must transform myself thoroughly. I am determined to learn from the workers and learn from the peasants, learning their spirit of selfless labor and active production, and work wholeheartedly to strive for the realization of socialist industrialization. I am also willing to follow the textile industry technicians across the country, respond to the call of Vice Premier Bo Yibo, make full use of existing fiber resources, and contribute all my strength to produce various kinds of yarn and cloth for the people of the whole country.

	If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please criticize and correct it.

### 充分利用纤维资源扩充纺织工业  酆云鹤代表的发言

专栏：

    充分利用纤维资源扩充纺织工业
    酆云鹤代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理关于目前国际形势和我国外交政策的讲话。并同意和拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的各项报告，建议大会予以通过。
    薄一波副总理在报告中曾提到“为着扩充纺织工业，对于各种纤维资源，必须充分利用”。我现就这一方面谈谈以下一些情况和存在的问题：
    更详细地调查野生麻的产量
    （一）现有的纺织纤维资源。我国除大量的棉花外，还生产多种多样的麻类。除人工培植的约四、五百万担苎麻、线麻、亚麻及胡麻外，还有多种野生麻类。
    1、自一九五二年新疆、青海、甘肃的盐碱荒地上发现红野麻（即罗布麻）经中央纺织部试验证明为良好的纺织原料以来，一九五七年山东广饶、利津等六个县约四百多万亩的盐碱荒地上也相继发现大批红野麻，这种麻当地称之为“茶棵子”，因为它的叶子可以作茶，故名，此叶也可以喂牛、羊，山东德县也有此麻。最近江苏滨海县也发现了红麻十万多斤。又山西、陕西、河北等省的盐碱荒地上也有野生红麻。现在已经发现的，全国约有二百至三百万担。如果把这些野麻利用起来，相当于一百多万担棉花。
    红野麻生性坚强，是一种宿根生植物，不怕气候的冷热变化，又能抗盐碱土壤，故能在盐碱荒地上自行生长，人工培植亦比较容易。因为它不占良田，故不与棉粮争地。我国盐碱荒地数量很大，估计至少有一亿多亩，若在这些荒地上种植红麻，不需投入大量资金，即可获得与开荒种棉同样的效果。因为每亩红麻也能生产五十至一百斤的可纺纤维。故红麻实为今后增加纺织原料的一个最有希望的品种。
    2、一九五七年又发现山脚麻，野生于福建山区。纤维细长，约等于六、七十支细羊毛。拉力为棉的四倍。其质量比苎麻好，而价格仅有苎麻的三分之一。其生产情况及产量，现正调查中。
    3、湖北省对于寻找野生纤维的劲头很大，一九五七年找到了十几种。这些纤维均可以造纸。其中野苎麻（即苎麻）并无人种植，是自己生长的，在湖北一省就找到四万多担。此外还找到糖麻近一万担。此外，一九五三年在东北发现了螫麻、艳麻，一九五七年在四川也找到了艳麻。螫麻的纤维比苎麻长而稍粗；艳麻的纤维约等于棉花，但强力为棉的四倍。
    这些野生麻的产量，希望有关部门予以更详细的调查。我们祖国地大物博，可纺纤维的蕴藏量一定很大，均尚有待于继续发现。
    更好地利用现有的纤维
    （二）试验和利用麻纤维的情况。纺织部从一九五○年即开始领导试验研究各种可纺的麻纤维。在脱胶方面已摸索出一套能用的方法和机器设备。有了这些准备，才能使现在各省所寻到的新纤维能即时得到鉴别和试纺应用。以上所列举的纤维资源中，有的是长纤维，如苎麻、螫麻、山脚麻和部分红野麻，能在绢纺机或毛纺机上纯纺或混纺；将生麻切短后经过脱胶，也可在棉纺机上混纺。但如胡麻、线麻、亚麻下脚、艳麻、糖麻，因其单纤维较短，可以作如下处理：（1）利用棉纺机与棉混纺；
    （2）亦能用粗毛纺机纺纯麻纱。
    一九五○年至一九五三年，对于苎麻曾作过多方面的试制工作。在衣着及其它日用品方面，有纯麻纺的各种花色衣料、袜子、蚊帐布、毛巾、台布、被单等；还有同绢丝、羊毛、人纤、棉花等混纺或交织的各色衣料。以上这些小量的试制品，曾出国展出过多次。在工业用品方面，有纯麻试纺织的帆布、运输带、锭带等。
    正式生产的苎麻纺织品，如上海国棉九厂、广东苎麻纺织厂生产有：水龙带、鞋缝线及各种麻布。
    以上两厂几年来在质量的提高和成本的降低都取得了一些成绩。
    根据多、快、好、省的原则，从一九五四年起在纺织部的领导下，利用苎麻、红野麻在上海开始进行棉麻混纺工作，这是一件新事情。经过三年来的试验工作，取得了一定的成绩，也还存在着某些问题，如细纱断头较多，强力较差。这些缺点，我们相信，在今后较长时间内会能克服的。在一九五七年由于原棉不足，各省市和各企业部门千方百计寻找增产资源，天津国棉第四第六厂为了增产节约，曾利用亚麻下脚进行棉麻混纺，纺出了粗支及中支纱，织成帆布，成绩很好，并取得了经验。上海国棉九厂利用苎麻长纤纺下脚短纤作棉麻混纺也增加了生产，积累了经验。湖北省利用最低级的苎麻（出口苎麻的剔庄货），经上海脱胶后，在沙市纱厂纺成棉麻混纺的中支纱，织制成近百余种织物，如毛巾、被单、各色花布等，曾引起领导上的重视。为了迅速的充分利用各种野生纤维及低级苎麻、苎麻绒、野生苎麻、红野麻及胡麻等，正在积极筹建日产二至八吨的炼麻厂。准备本年度开始棉麻混纺的有上海、湖北、湖南、四川、天津等地。广东新建的两万锭子的苎麻纺织厂，湖南株洲市五千锭子的苎麻纺织厂，均将于今明年先后投入生产。
    两点建议
    （三）目前存在的两个问题：
    1、红野麻的剥皮问题。生产红野麻的地区，多系地广人稀劳动力少。若用手工剥麻，价格太贵。如新疆每人每天工资两元，一个人只能剥二、三斤。为了迅速地使此项丰富的纺织原料能早日得到利用，建议中央指定有关部门负责研究试制此项剥麻机器。
    2、苎麻几年来在纺织部门，常因供不应求，造成生产上的困难，希望农业部门在可能的条件下增产苎麻，同时在本年度也希望有关部门考虑在可能的条件下多分配一些苎麻给纺织部，以利麻纺工业的发展。
    我听了各位代表的发言，使我感到万分的兴奋和鼓舞，我是一个旧知识分子，必须脱胎换骨地改造自己，我决心向工人学习，向农民学习，学习他们的忘我劳动和积极生产的精神，全心全意地努力工作，为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗。我并且愿意追随全国的纺织工业技术人员，响应薄一波副总理的号召，充分利用现有的纤维资源，为全国人民生产多种多样的纱布而贡献自己的一切力量。
    以上发言如有不当之处，敬请各位代表批评指正。
