　　I fully endorse the reports made to the conference by Vice-Chairman Peng, Vice-Premiers Bo and Li, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

　　I would like to talk about how we should run education in the future. Over the past eight years, our national education has achieved brilliant successes in terms of both quantity and quality, which is certain. However, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We still have certain shortcomings, namely, insufficient attention to political and labor education. Chairman Mao's educational policy is: "Education should enable those who receive it to develop in terms of morality, intellect, and physical fitness, and become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness." From Chairman Mao's instruction on this educational policy, it can be seen that to build a great socialist society, we must, according to Chairman Mao's educational policy, strengthen political and ideological education and labor education for students. To make students understand how to build socialism, we must cultivate young students into a new type of cultured laborer with socialist consciousness, not train students into bookworms who only know how to recite dead knowledge and are detached from politics and labor, studying solely for the sake of further education. I fully endorse the cultural and educational plan in Vice-Premier Bo Yibo's report on the national economic plan. He instructed that "the system of part-work part-study education should be implemented step by step. Secondary schools and universities, wherever conditions permit, should independently or jointly run experimental factories, experimental farms, and experimental pastures,... engaging in both education and production labor; those that cannot run them independently can sign production internship contracts with local factories, workshops, and service industries for internships, or participate in local regular voluntary labor and agricultural cooperative labor, so that learning and labor are combined." The proposal of such a part-work part-study system is timely and meets the needs of the 600 million people of the country. Moreover, it is seen that the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China has drafted a decision on advocating diligence and thrift in study among students. At the same time, middle schools across the country, driven by the general trend and popular sentiment, are beginning to develop in this direction. Taking the education departments of our Liaoning Province as an example, last winter, a plan was drafted to pilot a few middle schools with work-study programs this year, especially in remote mountainous counties, so that middle school students can engage in part-work part-study, and the state can even spend less money, with students using their own hands under the leadership of the principal and teachers to build houses and farm the land themselves, becoming self-sufficient and saving expenses for the state in the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily. This will be promoted from points to the whole. Currently, teachers and students in urban and rural middle schools in our province are taking time off each week to go to the countryside to participate in the production labor of agricultural cooperatives, and some are also participating in factory labor. In the future, this will be further advanced to catch up with the needs of the socialist great leap forward. Will there be difficulties in catching up? Will it be abandoned halfway? I believe not, because I have seen that even in the adverse conditions of the reactionary ruling era, some people ran a work-study middle school. I personally saw teachers and students in Shaanxi going up the mountains to collect firewood, reclaiming wasteland, building simple dormitories with their own hands, and making earthen paper. Although they were obstructed or persecuted by reactionary secret agents everywhere at that time, they finally overcame the difficulties. I know that the students' grades in that school were not lower than those in the reactionary national middle schools. They were able to endure hardship and loved labor, paid attention to the anti-Japanese national salvation, and most of the students' thinking was progressive. However, the reactionary regime at that time did not recognize those students, and they were not allowed to work after graduation, saying they were suspected of being communist. However, in the end, the most progressive students went to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to participate in revolutionary work. This situation only shows that work-study was possible even under that reactionary regime, let alone today, under the people's democratic regime led by the Party. Now, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the implementation of the part-work part-study system in our schools can certainly be successful and is full of hope.

　　Our country has a large population, mainly farmers, with farmers accounting for more than 500 million. There are more than 76 million primary and secondary school students, which is a good phenomenon. Currently, what can be done if students do not participate in labor after graduation? It is right for students to go on to further education, but how can there be so many universities and colleges to go to? If the old methods continue, students and parents will still fantasize about "all occupations are lowly, only studying is noble." If they cannot go on to further education, won't the education departments have to waste a lot of effort every summer vacation? Promoting the idea that labor is good and labor is glorious, but the content of education is preparation for further education, so students still want to go on to further education. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for secondary schools to shift to part-work part-study and enter into labor production, combining mental and physical labor, but the curriculum must also be changed to a certain extent. Will there be difficulties in changing the education system? There are difficulties, but as long as there is determination, a plan, and a method, the difficulties can be overcome step by step.

　　Last fall, I went to the countryside to visit the Shenyang middle school graduates participating in the labor of the solar fruit tree production cooperative in Gaiping County. At that time, I learned that the young men and women of the high school graduates of the three fruit tree cooperatives, under the leadership and education of the district and township party committees, were able to share weal and woe with the farmers and integrate with them in tasks such as picking apples, selecting apples, and packing apples. Through labor, the students truly realized the role and glory of labor. Therefore, student commune members are always concerned about all their fruit trees and cotton, and they also learned about students' love for technical research. One day, when a storm came, they hardly slept at night, fearing that the storm would harm the apples and cotton bolls in the commune. Another student heard the commune's mules running away at night, and he immediately consciously got up to chase the mules. These vivid and powerful facts prove and embody the students' deep feelings for the wealth of the commune after participating in the cooperative. This spirit of loving the commune as their home is truly moving. Young students realize that a bowl of porridge and a meal should be thought of as hard-won, and half a thread and half a strand should always be mindful of the difficulty of material resources; this kind of understanding is a valuable product of labor. This proves that labor has tempered the youth, transformed the youth, and also improved the youth. Therefore, students must participate in labor to promote their socialist consciousness. This further proves the correctness of the Party's policy on graduates. Gradually increasing the number of conscious and cultured youth participating in labor in rural areas can gradually change the face of rural areas, and can also quickly reform agricultural technology, increase the yield per unit area, and further promote the accelerated realization of the forty articles of the agricultural program. If the part-work part-study system is well implemented, students' participation in agricultural labor will be more conducive to the great leap forward in agricultural production.

　　Last December, I visited the Soviet Education Exhibition Hall and saw that they universally attached importance to comprehensive technical education in primary and secondary schools. Students in cities had to participate in factory internships, and students in rural areas had to participate in agricultural labor. Moreover, they could receive material rewards from the government for new varieties tested out through labor. There was also a rural middle school that was of a part-work part-study nature, and all their experimental fields were very successful, which is worth learning from.

　　In short, our country's current national education must, as Chairman Mao instructed, cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Students cultivated in this direction, with labor habits and a correct understanding of labor, will immediately participate in industrial and agricultural labor production if they fail to pass the entrance examination to universities and colleges. In this way, not only can young students get what they want, but also new reinforcements can be added to the industrial and agricultural production fronts. Comrades engaged in education, under the leadership of the Party, we have the confidence and determination to muster our energy, strive for the upper reaches, and take education work a step further.

　　中等学校半工半读非常必要
    车向忱代表的发言
    我完全拥护彭副委员长、薄、李副总理和吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。
    我想谈谈我们今后应该怎样办教育的问题。过去八年来，我们的国民教育从数量到质量都是有辉煌的成就，这是肯定的。但是不能满足现状，我们还有一定的缺点，就是对于政治和劳动教育注意不够。毛主席指出的教育方针是：“应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”从毛主席这样一个教育方针的指示可以看出来，我们建设伟大的社会主义，就必须根据毛主席的教育方针，要给学生加强政治思想教育和劳动教育，要使学生认识怎样建设社会主义，就必须把青年学生们培养成为一个新型的有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，不是要把学生培养成一个只知背诵死的知识，专门为升学而升学的脱离政治、脱离劳动的书呆子。我完全拥护薄一波副总理的国民经济计划报告里的文化教育计划，他指示“有步骤地实行半工半读教育制度，中等学校和高等学校凡是有条件单独举办或者联合举办实验工厂、实验农场和实验牧场的，……一面从事教育，一面从事生产劳动；不能单独举办的，可以同当地的工厂、作坊和服务行业订立生产实习合同，进行实习，或者参加当地的定期义务劳动和农业合作社劳动，使学习和劳动结合”。这样一个半工半读的制度的提出是及时的，也是符合全国六亿人民需要的。又看到了全国共青团中央已拟定了关于在学生中提倡勤工俭学的决定。同时全国各地方中学校由于大势所趋人心所向开始向这个方向发展。以我们辽宁省教育部门来说：去年冬已草拟一个计划，拟定在今年试办几处有工读性的中学校，尤其是要把学校办在边远的山区县份，使中学生能够半工半读，甚至国家少出几个钱，用学生的双手在校长、教员领导下亲自动手盖房子，自己种地，自给自足，以勤俭办学的精神给国家节省开支。这样由点到面的推广。现在我省城市和农村的中学的师生每周抽暇下乡参加农业合作社生产劳动，也有参加工厂劳动的，今后更要进一步赶上社会主义大跃进的需要。赶上去，会不会有困难？会不会半途而废呢？我相信不会的，因为我看到过去在反动统治时代恶劣的条件下，还有人搞过一个勤工俭学的中学校，在陕西我亲眼看过师生们上山打柴，也开过荒，师生自己动手盖简单宿舍也制过土纸等劳动。虽然当时是处处被反动的特务们所阻挠或迫害，但终于战胜了困难。我知道那个学校学生的成绩并不低于反动的国立中学，能吃苦爱劳动，注意抗日救亡，学生思想大半是进步的，只是当时反动政权下不承认那些学生，他们毕业不准工作，说有赤化嫌疑，可是最后最进步的学生走上陕北边区参加革命工作了。这一情况只是说明了勤工俭学在那反动政权下尚有可能，何况今天是党所领导的人民民主政权了。现在我们的学校在党中央的正确领导下，实施半工半读制度肯定可以搞好，是大有希望的。
    我国人口众多，主要是农民，农民占五亿以上，中小学生七千六百多万，这是一个好现象。目前来说，学生毕业如不参加劳动，怎能得了呢？学生毕业升学是应该的，但是哪有那样多的大专学校可升呢？如果照旧办法下去，学生和家长还幻想“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的。升不了学，不是年年暑假期间教育部门得费多少唇舌吗？宣传劳动好，劳动光荣，但是教育内容是为了升学的准备，所以学生还要升学。因此，中等学校转向半工半读、步入劳动生产，使脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来完全必要，但是课程也要有一定变更。教育制度改变一下有无困难呢？困难是有的，但是只要有决心，有计划，有办法，困难是可以逐步克服的。
    去年秋后，我曾下乡探望在盖平县太阳升等果树生产合作社的沈阳中学毕业生参加合作社的劳动，当时了解到三个果树合作社的高中毕业生的男女青年，在合作社摘苹果、选苹果、装苹果等项工作，在区乡党委的领导教育下，学生们能作到与农民同甘共苦，与农民打成一片。男女青年们通过劳动，真正体会到劳动的作用和光荣。因此，学生社员就时刻关心他们所有的果树和棉花，同时也了解到学生爱好技术的研究。有某天暴风雨来临，他们几乎夜不能眠，怕风暴伤害了社里的苹果和棉桃。还有个学生夜里听到社里骡子跑了，他马上自觉地起来追骡子。这些生动有力的事实，证明了也体现了学生参加合作社后对社的财富所抱有的深厚感情，这种爱社如家的精神，真是动人。青年学生们体会到一粥一饭当思来处不易，半丝半缕，恒念物力维艰；这种体会是宝贵的劳动产物。这证明劳动锻炼了青年，也改造了青年，同时也提高了青年，所以，学生非参加劳动，不能促进他们的社会主义觉悟。这更证明了党对毕业生政策的正确性。农村中逐渐增加有觉悟有文化的青年参加劳动，才能逐渐的改变农村的面貌，也能很快地改革农业技术，提高单位面积产量，更能促进农业纲要四十条的加速实现。如果半工半读学制贯彻好，学生参加农业劳动，对于农业生产大跃进更为有利了。
    去年十二月间，我曾参观了苏联教育展览馆，看到了他们中小学校里普遍的都重视综合技术教育，学生在城市要参加工厂实习，在农村要参加农业劳动，并且对于劳动试验出来的新品种，可以得到政府的物质奖励，更有一种农村中学是半工半读的性质，他们所有的试验田都很有成绩，是值得我们学习的。
    总之，我们国家目前的国民教育，必须按照毛主席所指示的那样：要培养有社会主义觉悟，有文化的劳动者。遵照这个方向培养下去的学生，有了劳动习惯和对劳动的正确认识，考不上大专学校，马上就会去参加工农劳动生产，这样一来，既能使青年学生各得其所，又能给工农业生产战线上增加新的生力军。搞教育的同志们，在党的领导下，我们有信心有决心鼓起干劲力争上游，把教育工作跃进一步。
