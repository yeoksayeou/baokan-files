Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th. The Soviet Union will develop its gas industry at a very rapid pace in the future. According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Union's total gas production in 1958 will increase to 31 billion cubic meters, an increase of 11 billion cubic meters over last year. The absolute increase in gas this year will be almost more than twice the increase in gas in the Soviet Union during the five years from 1951 to 1955.

In the next seven or eight years, the total gas production in the Soviet Union will increase to approximately 150 billion cubic meters (the vast majority of which will be low-cost natural gas). By 1972, total gas production will increase to 270 billion to 320 billion cubic meters, an increase of 13 to 15 times the current level. By 1965, the heat energy generated by natural gas extracted in the Soviet Union alone will be roughly equal to the total heat energy currently produced by coal from several important coal regions in the Soviet Union: Donbass, Pechora, and the Moscow coal region.

The Soviet Union currently has 160 gas producing areas, which is sufficient to ensure the rapid development of the natural gas industry in the coming years. However, in order to meet longer-term needs, gas producing areas will continue to be vigorously explored throughout the country, especially in the North Caucasus, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, the Volga River Basin, Central Asia, and Western Siberia.

In order to adapt to the rapid development of the gas industry, the Soviet Union will accelerate the construction of gas pipelines in the future. At present, plans to establish a unified gas network in the European part of the Soviet Union and the Ural region have matured. Due to the establishment of large-scale gas networks, more than 500 cities and settlements in the Soviet Union will be gasified in the next seven or eight years.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th. In the past year, the Soviet Union laid a total of 4,000 kilometers of oil and gas pipelines. In order to adapt to the rapid development of the oil and gas industry, it is planned to build another 5,000 kilometers of oil and gas pipelines this year.

This year, the Soviet Union will lay the second gas pipeline from Stavropol to Moscow (the first was completed a year ago), as well as the Serpukhov (in the Moscow region) - Leningrad, Saratov - Gorky gas pipelines, and other gas pipelines. In the next seven or eight years, the total length of Soviet gas pipelines will increase to 35,000 kilometers to 40,000 kilometers. The construction of gas pipelines is very difficult. For example, the gas pipelines being built in Armenia and Georgia must cross high mountains, canyons, and cliffs, and the gas pipelines laid in Central Asia must pass through large deserts.

### 苏联大力发展煤气工业  七八年内总产量将达一千五百亿立方公尺  煤气管总长度增加到三万五千到四万公里

    苏联大力发展煤气工业
    七八年内总产量将达一千五百亿立方公尺
    煤气管总长度增加到三万五千到四万公里
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联今后将以非常快的速度发展煤气工业。据苏联报纸报道，1958年苏联煤气总产量将增加到三百一十亿立方公尺，即比去年增加一百一十亿立方公尺。这一年煤气绝对增加量将差不多比1951到1955年五年间苏联的煤气增加量多两倍以上。
    在最近七、八年间，苏联的煤气总产量大约将增加到一千五百亿立方公尺
  （其中，绝大部分将是成本低廉的天然煤气）。到1972年，煤气总产量将增加到二千七百亿到三千二百亿立方公尺，即增加为现在的十三倍到十五倍。到1965年，单是苏联开采的天然煤气所能产生的热能，就将大约等于苏联几个重要煤区——顿巴斯、彼乔拉和莫斯科煤区目前出产的煤所能产生的全部热能。
    苏联目前已经有一百六十个煤气产地，足以保证最近几年天然煤气工业迅速发展的需要。但是，为了满足比较长时期的需要，今后还将在全国各地，特别是北高加索、乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、伏尔加河流域、中亚细亚和西西伯利亚等地大力勘探煤气产地。
    为了适应煤气工业的迅速发展，今后苏联将加速煤气管的建设。现在，建立苏联欧洲部分和乌拉尔地区的统一煤气网的计划已经成熟了。由于大规模的煤气网的建立，在最近七、八年内，苏联将有五百多个城市和居民点煤气化。
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　在过去一年中，苏联总共铺设了四千公里的输油管和煤气管。为了适应石油和煤气工业的迅速发展，今年还计划再修建五千公里的输油管和煤气管。
    今年苏联将要铺设从斯·塔米罗波尔到莫斯科的第二条煤气管（第一条已经在一年前建成），以及谢尔普霍夫（在莫斯科州）—列宁格勒、萨拉托夫—高尔基煤气管和其他一些煤气管。在今后七、八年内，苏联煤气管的总长度将增加到三万五千公里到四万公里。煤气管的建设工程十分艰巨。例如在亚美尼亚和格鲁吉亚建设的煤气管要穿越高山、峡谷和峭壁，在中亚细亚铺设的煤气管，要通过大沙漠。
