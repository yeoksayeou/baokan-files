    I fully support all the reports of the conference and will strive to implement them in the great leap forward of the production front in 1958.

    Now, I will report to the conference on the basic completion of illiteracy elimination in Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, focusing on the situation in one township.

    Yulin Township has made great achievements in illiteracy elimination. Ninety-seven percent of the township's young and middle-aged people have become literate farmers. Currently, the township runs eight higher primary school classes and three after-work junior high school classes. Every village has a theatrical troupe, and every household has books and newspapers, making cultural life very active.

    Yulin Township is a mountainous area inhabited by both Han and Korean ethnic groups, with a total of ten production cooperatives, 772 households, and 3,305 people. The rate of farmer participation in the cooperatives reaches 99.6 percent. Under the leadership of the Party, agricultural production has also developed along with the development of cooperation. The total grain output in 1949 was 2.74 million jin, and in 1956, even under the impact of autumn floods, it increased to 3.86 million jin, an increase of over 41 percent. As people's living standards improve, their demand for culture is also increasing, especially after the advanced stage of collectivization.

    The township began to hold farmer literacy classes in 1949, organizing learning while conducting propaganda. In 1952, the quick literacy method was promoted, and a system of year-round learning was initiated. However, efforts were inconsistent, resulting in a situation where winter schools were held every year, and learning started from scratch every year. From 1953, the practice of "guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning" and the adoption of various forms of learning began, with an average of 34 people becoming literate each year. Some farmers became interested in learning culture. In 1956, under the influence of the high tide of advanced collectivization, illiteracy elimination also reached a high tide. In this situation, they analyzed the situation of illiteracy elimination, made plans, and organized the final stages, mobilizing all 333 young and middle-aged illiterate men and women in the township who met the conditions to participate in learning. After a year, by early April 1957, 287 people had reached the literacy standard, accounting for 86.18 percent of the township's illiterate population. Now, 97 percent of the township's young and middle-aged people have become literate farmers. In order to continue to improve, they have also established eight higher primary school classes and three after-work junior high school classes, with more than 270 students pursuing further education. Due to the active cultural life, every village has a theatrical troupe, and every household has books and newspapers. The libraries of each village have 8,160 books, and farmers often organize dance parties in their spare time.

    They are not only advanced in illiteracy elimination but also not lagging behind in other work. Last year, they completed the tasks of grain requisition and purchase, as well as the purchase of live pigs, ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. Furthermore, in response to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, farmers studied agricultural technology publications and created a chaotic grass rice harvester (i.e., a crushed grass grain cleaner) during threshing, which increased efficiency seven times compared to manual winnowing (threshing the harvested crops again). On average, it threshed an additional 50 jin of rice per hectare, allowing the machine to clean a total of 40,000 jin of rice. Now, in order to achieve a great leap forward in production in 1958, the township is swept up in a vigorous upsurge of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in the frozen and snowy land, fighting to achieve the requirements of the agricultural development program ahead of schedule.

    How could Yulin Township complete the illiteracy elimination work so quickly?

    The main reasons why Yulin Township was able to complete the illiteracy elimination work so quickly are as follows:

    1. Analyze the Situation, Plan Comprehensively, and Organize the Final Stages

    Under the encouragement of the high tide of collectivization in 1956 and the guidance of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the Township Party Committee inspected the illiteracy elimination work, but the conclusion was that they were not confident despite years of effort. Therefore, they decided to investigate thoroughly. The Township Party Secretary, the Township Head, and others went to Majia Cooperative to conduct a trial investigation by promoting spring plowing. Subsequently, each cooperative also conducted an investigation. It was found that there were 470 young and middle-aged illiterate people in the township. From 1949 to the spring of 1956, a total of 137 people had become literate, accounting for over 46 percent, leaving 333 people. However, most of these remaining 54 percent were semi-literate or close to meeting the literacy standards. Based on this, they analyzed that due to the development of illiteracy elimination work in recent years, the masses had already formed a habit of learning. At the same time, a large number of primary and secondary school graduates had joined production, and the illiteracy elimination team had grown stronger (at that time, there were 17 civil school teachers, 73 "little teachers," and 76 activists). Many experiences had also been accumulated in illiteracy elimination work in recent years, and the collective production system of cooperatives made learning more convenient. However, there were also difficulties, which were that those with better learning conditions were decreasing, while those with poorer conditions were relatively increasing (those with poor memory, those with many children and heavy housework, etc.). Thus, they calculated three accounts and made arrangements: (1) calculating the account of illiteracy elimination targets and illiteracy elimination forces, finding that there were 350 people who could teach, which not only could fully cover the teaching but also had a surplus; (2) based on experience, calculating the account of the effectiveness of different learning forms for different targets, seeing which forms and methods were good; (3) calculating the account of the time required to eliminate illiteracy in one person. In this way, teaching arrangements were made from person to household, and the time for literacy was determined, so that teachers and learners signed contracts for guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning. The Township Party Committee formulated a plan, initially determining to complete the task of illiteracy elimination in the autumn of 1958, and put forward the call to strive for cultural families and cultural teams. After extensive discussions among the masses, the time was advanced to the end of April 1957 to complete illiteracy elimination.

    However, the plan did not go smoothly. At the beginning, some cadres lacked confidence, especially in women, believing that the remaining ones had many children, heavy housework, were scattered, and had great ideological obstacles, fearing that further rash advances would lead to failure and being unable to clean up the mess, which would be embarrassing, etc. Some people also said, "I've learned a bagful of big characters in recent years, just blowing air if you want to eliminate illiteracy in one year," etc. After handing over the plan to the masses for discussion, the situation changed greatly. The core force for illiteracy elimination increased by 272 people, and 17 different forms of childcare organizations were set up, solving the difficulties for women who had many children, heavy housework, and inconvenient learning and production. In this way, women became more active in participating in learning and production, increasing from the original 39 to 251 working in the fields. Civil school teachers and "little teachers" also specifically covered the targets to be eliminated. The masses reflected that this time "the leadership has something to grasp, the masses have something to strive for, and the civil school teachers are also clear-headed." The civil school teacher Lu Guangliang said, "I have been a civil school teacher for several years, organizing winter school every year and starting from scratch every year, and I can't see any enthusiasm. This time, I finally have a clue, and I feel clear-headed." The confidence of the core force and the masses has been improved, and they have become active in participating in production. For example, Tian Guilian, a mother of eight children, solved the problem of childcare. She earned 700 work points and 120 yuan from digging medicinal herbs and 308 bundles of firewood in a year and also got rid of her illiterate status.

    2. Cadres Take the Lead, Layer-by-Layer Contracting, Diverse Forms, and Sound Systems

    The Township Party Committee provides unified leadership and comprehensive arrangements for production and learning. According to the busy and slack seasons, they put forward different organizational forms of illiteracy elimination to adapt to production activities and proposed arrangements for learning requirements, centralized learning, and review and consolidation time. Production and illiteracy elimination were closely integrated. Under the influence of the reporting of good news from the joint cooperatives, the entire township put forward the slogan of "striving to be the first in the exam," and each cooperative successively put forward "striving to be the second in the exam" to compete. Thus, each cooperative, branch secretary contracted the cooperative, branch committee members contracted the team, Party members contracted the group, and activists contracted by person. One person was left in the township to take care of daily work, and other cadres went down to the cooperative to contract production, contract various tasks, and contract illiteracy elimination, so that each cadre regarded it as an indispensable task. Cooperative cadres played a leading role in learning, and most of them first got rid of their illiterate status. The township established a training station, and the cooperative established a teaching and research group, electing capable civil school teachers as teaching directors. They also established a system of "one certificate and two slips" (one certificate is to guarantee learning time, and two slips are to write a leave slip if something happens, and whoever occupies learning time must write a reason slip). They also put forward the slogan "learn at night, practice during the day, and study all year round." In order to adapt to production and take care of the learning of different targets, they adopted various forms of illiteracy elimination: night civil school blitz, review in the fields during the day (during rest), and brought mobile book bags to the fields. During rest, "little teachers" consciously organized reading newspapers to help everyone review what they had learned. They organized three- or two-person kang-head groups for women with many children, and "little teachers" went to teach at night (some were daytime classes), and they checked and helped review during the day. They also carried out the method of one person eliminating one illiterate, guaranteeing teaching and guaranteeing learning. They called the illiterate who were difficult to eliminate "taking the fortress." For example, it took a lot of effort to take the fortress of Wu Yuxia. The first "little teacher" who contracted her was so angry that she cried and ran away after only a few days. Later, Ni Zemin, a patient and strong fifteen-year-old, was sent to contract her. At first, Wu excused herself by borrowing things to hide away. Once, the "little teacher" waited until dark without her returning. This continued for six or seven days, but Ni Zemin did not lose heart. After that, he went at night, but as soon as Wu saw Ni coming, she hid away again, returning only when she was about to sleep. As soon as she entered the door and saw that he had not left, she said, "…I know all the shit you pulled when you squatted down. Forget it, go back to sleep quickly." After Ni Zemin was rebuffed, he thought: No matter how difficult it is, I must take this fortress. The next day, he went without mentioning the word "learning," but just helped her with work and coaxed the children. After a few days, she was moved and started learning. But when she encountered difficulties, she either beat the children and cried or threw a tantrum. The "little teacher" gave her his prize-winning notebook and pencil and patiently adopted the method of learning less and teaching more, analyzing the shapes of the characters, recognizing characters by seeing objects, and encouraging her when she made progress. Later, Wu Yuxia became an activist in learning. After a year, a rural woman who didn't know a single character got rid of her illiterate status one month ahead of schedule according to the plan.

    In addition, they also used literacy signs erected on the roadside and in the center of the street, and wrote the new characters of the day on them, which the instructors explained when they passed by on the way to and from the fields collectively. They also widely used the methods of recognizing characters by seeing objects (pasting characters on various utensils), broadcasting literacy, and students sending character blocks for guidance. The public opinion said that this form was "learning at night, practicing during the day, seeing the characters more than a dozen times a day." These forms not only created a strong learning atmosphere but also played a positive guiding role in reviewing and consolidating new characters.

    3. Cultivate Models, Spread Experience, and Promote Comprehensively

    After the township cadres divided and contracted, they demanded that the cooperatives have key teams and the teams have key people, making models to promote the work. Over the past year, in addition to creating a chaotic grass rice harvester, harvesting more grain, and promoting the granular fertilizer seed mixer created by Yulin Cooperative, which increased work efficiency tenfold, they organized teaching demonstrations in illiteracy elimination, promoted the experience of Manan Cooperative in solving work stoppages and facilitating centralized learning by recording work points in the fields, the experience of Majia Cooperative in various forms of learning, Tian Guiyun's method of teaching new characters by connecting words, Fu Yingman's method of teaching a large number of new characters in a blitz, etc. Therefore, the in-depth development of illiteracy elimination work was greatly promoted. Over the past year, 70 advanced individuals have been rewarded, and 36 young people have joined the Communist Youth League organization. They not only promoted the experience of local living examples but also paid attention to learning from the experience of other places, such as the planning of Xinsheng Village and Yang Surong's teaching method in Liaoning. In this way, continuous mutual learning and promotion made the work lively and vigorously.

    4. Strengthen Ideological Education, Grasp Propaganda and Mobilization, and Form an Atmosphere of Glory in Illiteracy Elimination

    During the high tide of collectivization, they mobilized 200 young people, 120 women, and 330 members of the Illiteracy Elimination Association, organized lecture groups and propaganda teams, and launched a large-scale propaganda movement. Through the propaganda of the relationship between building a new socialist countryside and improving culture, a high tide of illiteracy elimination was also formed. At that time, every household posted slogans, and everyone wore name tags for learning culture. From then on, the final stages of illiteracy elimination also began. They accepted the experience of this propaganda and often used methods such as express reports, blackboards, honor rolls, radio stations, slides, and cultural homes to commend advanced individuals and advanced deeds of wives persuading husbands, daughters helping mothers, and parents-in-law supporting daughters-in-law to learn. They also combined teaching, targeted the ideological situation of the students, and used methods such as organizing discussions and individual connections to solve ideological obstacles and promote illiteracy elimination. They exchanged experiences at the township and cooperative model award meetings, and whether it was a production unit or an individual, they regarded illiteracy elimination as a condition to establish positive figures. This played a certain positive role in promoting production and learning.

    Over the past year, they have used the above-mentioned various methods to infiltrate each other, making the work of the entire township greatly active.

    Yulin Township's leading completion of the illiteracy elimination work has promoted the development of Ning'an County. More than 80 percent of the county's more than 100,000 young and middle-aged people have escaped from the state of illiteracy, basically completing the task of illiteracy elimination.

    Yulin Township's leading completion of the illiteracy elimination task has promoted the development of Ning'an County. In the spring of 1957, they organized an introduction at the county's three-level cadre meeting and specially convened a county-wide illiteracy elimination core cadre meeting, introducing Yulin Township's illiteracy elimination plan and promoting their experience. After a year of efforts in 1957, out of the county's 285,000 people, among the 102,600 young and middle-aged people, those who were literate (meeting the literacy standards) had reached 82,840, accounting for more than 80 percent. Currently, 9,001 farmers are participating in higher primary school classes, and 6,117 are participating in junior high school classes. Nearly a thousand people have been selected as technicians, accountants, and propagandists. Most townships and cooperatives have theatrical troupes, and farmers throughout the county subscribe to 42,000 copies of various newspapers and periodicals. Now, the county has basically completed the task of illiteracy elimination (there are still 16,222 illiterate, semi-literate, or close to being eliminated). Therefore, Ning'an County has become a cultural county. Now, they are organizing forces to eliminate the remaining illiteracy and are separately grouping those who have been eliminated to consolidate and continue further study, fighting to improve the scientific knowledge level of farmers.

    In order to better and comprehensively realize the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and build a new socialist countryside, it is recommended that relevant departments can plan and compile some practical scientific knowledge textbooks for rural areas, so as to carry out the learning of scientific knowledge in rural areas.

    百分之八十以上的青壮年有了文化
    宁安县基本上完成扫盲任务
    任国栋代表谈黑龙江宁安县榆林乡扫盲的经验和全县的扫盲成就
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告，并且在一九五八年生产战线的跃进过程中，努力贯彻执行。
    现在，我就黑龙江省宁安县基本完成扫盲问题，向大会汇报一个乡的情况。
    榆林乡扫盲工作有很大成绩，全乡百分之九十七的青壮年成了有文化的农民，现在全乡办了八个高小班，三个业余初中班。全乡社社有剧团、户户有书报，文化生活十分活跃。
    榆林乡是一个汉族、朝鲜族合居的山区，共十个生产社，七百七十二户、三千三百零五人，入社农户达百分之九十九点六。在党的领导下，随着合作化的发展，农业生产也有了发展，一九四九年粮食总产量二百七十四万斤，一九五六年在秋季水灾侵袭下，也增长到三百八十六万斤，提高百分之四十一强。由于人民生活的提高，人民对文化的要求也在增强，尤其高级合作化后更加明显。
    该乡于一九四九年开始举办农民识字班，一面组织学习，一面进行宣传。一九五二年推广了速成识字法，开始坚持常年学习制度，但都文齐武不齐，因此前三年形成年年办冬学，年年从头学的局面。从一九五三年贯彻了包教保学、采用多种形式学习的办法起，每年平均扫盲三十四名，部分农民对学文化已发生了兴趣。一九五六年在高级合作化高潮的影响下，扫盲也成了高潮，他们在这种形势下，分析了扫盲的情况，进行了规划，组织扫尾，于是动员全乡现有三百三十三名有条件的男女青壮年文盲，参加了学习。经过一年时间，于一九五七年四月初，使二百八十七名达到了扫盲标准，占全乡文盲数的百分之八十六点一八。现在全乡的青壮年有百分之九十七成为有文化的农民了。他们为了继续提高，又办了八个高小班、三个业余初中班，二百七十余名学员在深造。由于文化生活的活跃，已形成社社有剧团，户户有书报，各社图书馆有书八千一百六十册，并且农民在业余时间，经常组织舞蹈晚会。
    他们不仅在扫盲工作上是先进的，而且在其他工作上也不落后，去年征粮购粮与收购生猪等任务，都是提前超额完成了。并且农民响应增产节约号召，学习农业技术刊物，在打场时创造了乱草打稻机（即碎草清粒机），比人工捞扬（把打过的庄稼再打一次）效率提高七倍，平均每公顷多打出稻子五十斤，使该机器共清理出稻子四万斤。现在该乡为了一九五八年生产大跃进，在冰天雪地里卷入轰轰烈烈的兴修水利积肥的高潮，为提前实现农业发展纲要的要求而进行着斗争。
    榆林乡怎么能这样快完成扫盲工作？
    榆林乡能够很快地完成扫盲工作，主要原因是这样的：
    一、分析情况，全面规划，组织扫尾
    该乡党委在一九五六年合作化高潮鼓舞与农业发展纲要（修正草案）督导下，检查了扫盲工作，但结论是年年扫而心里没有底。于是下决心摸底，乡委书记、乡长等，到了马家社，通过推动春耕，进行摸底试点，接着各社也都经过了摸底。统计全乡青壮年文盲有四百七十人，从一九四九年至一九五六年春，共扫盲一百三十七名，占百分之四十六强，还剩下三百三十三名。但这百分之五十四左右，多是半文盲或接近扫除标准的。他们据此进行分析，由于几年来扫盲工作的开展，群众已经形成学习习惯，同时有大批中小学毕业生参加了生产，扫盲队伍已经壮大（当时有民校教师十七名，小先生七十三名，积极分子七十六名），几年来扫盲工作也积累了许多经验，合作社的集体生产制度更便利于学习。但是也有困难，这就是学习条件较好的日益减少，条件较差的相对的增多（记忆力差的、孩子多家务重的等），这样又算了三笔账，进行安排：（一）算扫盲对象与扫盲力量的账，找到能教学的有三百五十名，不但可以全部包教，而且有余；（二）根据经验，算不同对象用不同形式学习效果的账，看那些形式好、办法好；（三）算扫除一个文盲所需时间的账，这样由人到户安排包教，确定脱盲时间，使教者与学者订立包教保学合同。乡党委就这样订了规划，初步确定一九五八年秋季完成扫盲任务，并提出争取文化之家、文化队的号召，经过群众广泛的讨论后，使时间提前到一九五七年四月末完成扫盲。
    但是，规划并不是一帆风顺的。开始有的干部就信心不足，尤其对妇女，以为剩下的都是孩子多、家务重，又分散，有的思想障碍也大，怕再冒进，下台不好收拾，扫除不了，喊出去多么难堪，等等。有的群众也说：“几年来斗大的字识一口袋，一年扫除，净吹”等。把规划交给群众讨论后，情况大大变了。扫盲骨干力量增加二百七十二人，并且组织了十七个不同形式的托儿组织，解决了妇女孩子多、家务重，学习生产不方便的困难。这样，妇女参加学习与生产都积极了，由原三十九名增加到二百五十一名下地劳动，民校教师、小先生同时也具体包了被扫的对象。群众反映这次“领导有抓手，群众有奔头，民校教师心里也亮堂了”，民校教师卢广亮讲“我当了几年民校教师，年年组织上冬学、年年从头学，也看不出劲头来，这回可有头绪了，我心里也亮了”，骨干与群众的信心都提高了，参加生产也积极了，如八个孩子的妈妈田桂莲解决了孩子的托管，她一年来挣工七百分，挖药材挣钱一百二十元，打柴三百零八捆并且摘掉了文盲帽子。
    二、干部带头，层层包干，形式多样，制度健全。
    乡党委在生产与学习上统一领导，全面安排，根据忙闲季节，提出扫盲不同的组织形式，适应生产活动，并提出学习要求与集中学习以及复习巩固的时间安排问题。使生产与扫盲紧密结合，在联合社报捷的影响下，全乡提出“争取考第一”的号召，各社也相继提出“争取考第二”进行竞赛。于是各社，支书包社、支委包队、党员包组、积极分子按人包干，乡里留一人照顾日常工作，其他干部下去到社，包生产、包各项工作、包扫盲，使每个干部都把它当成一条不能缺少的事去办，社干部在学习中起带头作用，一般的都首先摘掉了文盲帽子，乡里建立了传授站，社建立了教学研究组，选举能力强的民校教师为教导主任，并且建立了“一证二条”的制度（一证是保证学习时间，二条是有事写请假条，谁占用学习时间写理由条），并且提出口号“晚上学，白天练，常年学习不间断”，为了适应生产与照顾不同对象的学习，他们采用多种形式扫盲：晚间民校突击，白天下地复习（休息时）并把流动书袋拿到地头，在休息时，小先生有意识的组织读书报，帮助大家复习所学过的字，对孩子多的妇女组织三二人的炕头组，晚间小先生去教（有的是白日班），白天有空检查帮助复习，并且开展了一人扫一盲办法，包教保学，他们对于难扫除的文盲叫拿堡垒，例如拿吴玉霞这个堡垒的时候费了很大的劲，第一个小先生包了不几天就被气得哭跑了，后来又派了一个耐心而坚强的十五岁的倪泽民包教她，开始吴借口借东西躲出去了，有一次小先生一直等到天黑也没有回来，这样连续六、七天，但倪泽民没有灰心，以后就晚间去，可是一见倪来，她又躲出去了，等到临睡时才回来，一进门见他还没有走，便说：“……你撬起尾巴拉了几个屎蛋我都知道，你算啦吧，快回去睡觉”。倪泽民碰了钉子后，就想：再困难我也非拿下这个堡垒不可，第二天去，也不提学习二字，只是帮助她干活，哄孩子，过几天后她被感动了，开始了学习，但在碰到困难时不是打孩子哭，就是耍脾气，小先生又把自己得奖的本子、铅笔送给她，并耐心的采取少学多教、分析字形、见物识字、有进步就鼓励的办法，进行辅导，以后吴玉霞成了学习中的积极分子。经过一年的时间，使一个一字不识的农村妇女，按照计划提前一个月摘掉了文盲帽子。
    除此以外，还用识字牌竖于路旁街心，并把每日的生字写上，在集体下地与回家经过路旁时由辅导员给解说，并且广泛运用了见物识字（各种用具上帖字），广播识字，学生送字块等办法辅导，群众的舆论说这种形式，是“黑天学，白天练，一天见字十几遍”，这些形式不仅造成了浓厚的学习风气，并且对复习巩固生字起了积极的辅导作用。
    三、培养典型、传播经验，推动全面
    乡干部分工包干后提出，要求社有重点队，队有重点人，做出样子，推动工作。一年来在生产上，除了创造了乱草打稻机，多收了粮食，推广了榆林社创造的颗粒肥料拌种器，提高工作效率十倍，在扫盲上组织了教学观摩，推广了马南社地头记工解决窝工和便于集中学习的经验，马家社的多种形式学习经验，田桂芸的生字连词教学法，傅英满的大量突击生字教学法等等，因此大大的推动了扫盲工作的深入开展，一年来有七十名先进人物受到奖励，三十六名青年加入了共青团的组织。他们不仅推广了当地现身说法的经验，而且注意学习了外地经验，如新生村的规划以及辽宁的杨素荣教学法等，这样不断的互相学习推动，使工作生动活泼的开展起来了。
    四、加强思想教育，抓紧宣传鼓动，形成了扫盲光荣的空气
    他们在合作化高潮时候，发动了二百名青年，一百二十名妇女，三百三十名扫盲协会的会员，组织了讲演团宣传队，掀起了声势浩大的宣传运动，通过建设社会主义的新农村与提高文化的关系的宣传，也随着形成了扫盲高潮，当时是家家贴标语，人人戴学习文化的名笺，从此以后扫盲的扫尾工作也相继开始了，他们接受了这次宣传经验，经常以快报，黑板报，光荣榜，广播台，幻灯，文化之家等办法，表扬了妻劝夫、女帮母、公婆支持媳妇学习的先进人物和先进事例。并且结合教学，针对学员的思想情况，用组织座谈和个别串连的办法，去解决思想障碍，推动扫盲，在乡社的奖模会上交流经验，不论生产单位与个人，都把扫盲当成一个条件，来树立正面人物，这样对生产与学习起了一定的积极推动作用。
    他们一年来运用了上述各种方法互相渗透，使全乡工作大大活跃了。
    榆林乡带头完成扫盲工作，对宁安全县起了推动作用。全县十万多青壮年中已有百分之八十以上脱离了文盲状态，基本上完成了扫盲任务。
    榆林乡的带头完成扫盲任务，对宁安全县起了推动作用，他们于一九五七年春，在全县三级干部会议上组织了介绍，并且专门召开了全县的扫盲骨干会议，介绍了榆林乡的扫盲规划，推广了他们的经验，经过一九五七年一年的努力，全县二十八万五千人，其中十万二千六百名青壮年中，有文化的（够扫盲标准的）已达到八万二千八百四十人，占百分之八十以上。现在参加高小班学习的农民九千零一人，参加初中班学习的六千一百一十七名，并且有近千人被选为技术员、记账员、宣传员，大部分乡社有剧团，全县农民订各种报刊四万二千份，现在全县已基本上完成了扫盲任务（尚有一万六千二百二十二名文盲、半文盲或接近扫除的）。因此宁安县已经成为文化县了，现在他们正在组织力量扫除剩余的文盲，并且把已扫除的分别编组进行巩固与继续深造，为提高农民科学知识水平而斗争。
    为了更好的全面的实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）建设社会主义的新农村，建议有关部门能够有计划的编写一些对农村实用的科学知识课本，以便在农村开展科学知识的学习。
