　　Kunming Launches a "Eliminate the Four Pests" Campaign
    Breakthroughs Still Needed in a Few Neglected Areas

    (Our dispatch) Kunming City has recently seen over 200,000 people involved in a patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests.

    Kunming, a city of fewer than 400,000 people, has witnessed thousands upon thousands of people engaged daily in the movement to eliminate the four pests and improve hygiene, led by Zhao Zengyi, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Secretaries Guo Shaochuan, and Deputy Mayors Zhang Langji and Jing Zhuru. Twenty-five main streets have been swept clean. Health units at the provincial and municipal levels have organized more than 20 medical workers into 224 mosquito and fly eradication teams. In a single day, they fumigated over 1,800 meters of sewers with chemicals, cleaned over 1,600 toilets, and dug up over 300 kilograms of pupae and maggots. According to incomplete statistics, the entire city has swept 25 streets, washed over 41,000 square meters of streets, removed over 19,000 loads of garbage, collected over 400 kilograms of maggots, killed the equivalent of over 600 matchboxes of flies, caught over 1,000 rats, and cleaned over 2,000 toilets.

    Although the health campaign has been vigorously launched among the broad masses, some "dead corners" still exist. Units such as the Yunnan Iron Factory and the Panlong District Tax Bureau have historically been neglected in the health movement. They have so much garbage that they have run out of places to put it. The flower beds in the Yunnan Iron Factory's courtyard have become garbage dumps, and the Tax Bureau's offices have also become piles of garbage. Surrounding residents have voiced their opinions, demanding that they make immediate improvements.

　　昆明已掀起除四害热潮
    少数死角地区还须突破
    本报讯　最近，昆明市已有二十多万人投入了以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。
    不到四十万人口的昆明市，近日来在市委第一书记赵增益、书记郭少川和副市长张琅基、经竹如等负责同志的带动下，每日都有成千上万的人投入除四害讲卫生的运动中，二十五条大街清扫得干干净净。省级市级各卫生单位组织了二十多名医务工作人员，组成二百二十四个灭蚊蝇队，他们一天就用药物熏了下水道一千八百多公尺，清理厕所一千六百多个，挖蛹挖蛆三百多公斤。据不完全的统计，全市已清扫街道二十五条，冲洗街道四万一千多平方公尺，清除垃圾一万九千多担，捞蛆四百多公斤，灭蝇六百多火柴盒，捕鼠一千多只，清扫厕所二千多个。
    尽管卫生运动已在广大的阶层中汹涌澎湃的开展，但是个别“死角”仍是存在的。云南铁厂、盘龙区税务局等单位，历来是卫生运动的死角，他们的垃圾已多得无处可放，云南铁工厂院子里的花池成了倒垃圾的地方，税务局的办公室也成了垃圾堆。周围居民纷纷提出意见，要他们立即改进。
