Children are growing up but using less grain

I have four children, and my husband works at the People's Bank. My eldest child studies at a water conservancy school, the second child is in junior high, the third is in elementary school, and the youngest daughter is in kindergarten. The whole family of six relies on my husband's monthly income of over eighty yuan to make a living. In addition to housework, I also serve as a family member representative, literacy teacher, and street sanitation worker. In my spare time, I also do some needlework, which can also supplement some pocket money.

Now I would like to introduce some experience in saving grain.

My family of five eats at home (the eldest child lives at school). In 1955, the grain ration was 123.5 jin. In 1956, I saved 7 jin, and last year I saved another 3 jin. Now only 113.5 jin are left each month. Although the children are getting bigger day by day, I have never asked to increase the grain, nor have I asked for subsidies. Instead, the grain consumption has decreased year by year. Because I understand that grain is the most precious treasure, and the country needs grain for construction. Based on my experience over the years, the principles of saving grain are: eat fermented dough instead of unleavened dough, eat noodle soup instead of dry noodles, eat steamed rice instead of boiled rice, and eat dishes that save rice instead of dishes that waste rice. The actual situation is this: five people eat boiled rice using 2.5 jin of rice per meal, while eating steamed rice only requires 2 jin of rice and there will still be a bowl of rice left over; eating dry noodles requires 3 jin of flour, while eating noodle soup only requires 2 jin. In addition, eating stuffed buns is also more flour-saving than eating steamed buns. I often use cabbage stalks and dried shrimp to make fillings for steamed vegetable buns. Three jin of flour can make five pots, which is more than eating steamed buns for half a meal.

I hope that housewives with experience in thrift and household management will introduce more experiences.

### 孩子长大了用粮反而减少了

　　孩子长大了用粮反而减少了
    我有四个孩子，爱人在人民银行工作。大孩子在水利学校读书，二孩子上初中，三孩子上小学，小女儿在幼儿站。全家六口人，全仗爱人每月八十多元收入维持生活。我除了操持家务以外，还担任家属委员、扫盲教师和街道卫生等工作。空闲时还作些针线活，也能补助一些零用。
    现在我想介绍一点节约粮食的经验。
    我家五口人吃饭（大孩子住校）。1955年粮食订量一百二十三斤半，1956年节约了七斤，去年又节约三斤，现在每月只剩一百一十三斤半了。孩子们虽然一天比一天大，可是我没要求过增加粮食，也没要求过补助，用粮反而一年比一年减少。因为我懂得，粮食是宝中之宝，国家要建设就少不了粮食。根据我几年来的经验，节省粮食的原则是：吃发面不吃死面，吃汤面不吃捞面，吃蒸饭不吃捞饭，吃省饭的菜不吃费饭的菜。实际情况是这样，五口人吃捞饭每顿用二斤半米，吃蒸饭有二斤米就够了，还能剩一碗饭；吃捞面要用三斤面，吃汤面有二斤就够了。另外，吃带馅的包子也比吃馒头省面。我常用白菜帮子和蝦皮做馅蒸菜包子，三斤面能蒸五锅，比蒸馒头多吃半顿。
    希望勤俭持家有经验的主妇们，多多介绍经验。
