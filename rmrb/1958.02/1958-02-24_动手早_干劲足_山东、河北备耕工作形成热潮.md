Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 23rd: Shandong Province's spring production this year started with a strong momentum, high enthusiasm, and high attendance rate. According to preliminary statistics, 55 counties and cities have set their grain production increase targets at 400 to 500 catties per mu or more. Huang County and Shouzhang County, with the strongest momentum, plan to create "1,000-catty counties." Xiajin and Gaotang counties, which have over one million mu of cotton fields, will create "100-catty per mu ginned cotton counties" this year. Judging from the production increase targets set by various special districts and counties, they generally exceed the bumper year of 1956 by more than 50%, and some even double or triple. Most agricultural cooperatives in the province have also formulated or are revising production plans, and more than half of the cooperatives have completed or are in the process of carrying out the "three guarantees and five fixings" work. According to understanding of the agricultural cooperatives that have formulated plans, over 10,000 cooperatives are demanding that this year's yield reach the national agricultural development program (revised draft) target of "500 catties per mu," over 1,000 cooperatives will create "1,000-catty cooperatives," and some cooperatives are demanding to reach 1,000 catties per mu or even double 1,000 catties.

In order to achieve the above production increase targets, Huimin, Liaocheng, Heze, Tai'an, Linyi and other special districts started a manure delivery upsurge in mid-January, more than 20 days earlier than last year. Currently, 210,000 people in Qidong, Boxing, and Liaocheng counties participate in manure accumulation and delivery every day. In Huantai County, the fastest county, spring field manure delivery is nearly completed. In order to maintain good moisture and strive for timely sowing, many areas have adopted the method of thawing one layer of frozen soil and harrowing one layer of soil. The progress of harrowing the land is very rapid. According to statistics from eleven counties including Linqing, more than 3 million mu of spring fields have been harrowed. Irrigation of wheat fields has also begun in various places.

The amount of fertilizer applied to spring fields this year will greatly exceed last year. At present, the province has accumulated 380 billion catties of soil fertilizer. In addition to being used for topdressing wheat fields, each mu of spring fields this year can be applied with more than 5,000 catties of base fertilizer, which is one and a half times more than last year's spring field base fertilizer. The transportation and selection of seeds in various places have also been carried out earlier than in previous years.

The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to make the spring production upsurge better than last winter, with a larger scale and greater enthusiasm. It requires all localities to do everything possible to strive for a good wheat harvest. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that this is the primary key to striving for a bumper harvest in 1958. The Provincial Party Committee also requires strengthening technical guidance for sowing, improving the quality of sowing, and ensuring that 80 million mu of spring-sown crops are sown well and grow vigorously on time. In spring production, we should continue to grasp the three key elements of increasing production: water, fertilizer, and soil, and achieve the goal of reaching 30 million mu of irrigation area this year in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 22nd: Currently, over 13 million people in rural areas of Hebei Province are engaged in spring plowing and sowing work.

According to statistics from 55 counties in Baoding, Cangxian, and Handan special districts, more than 23 million mu of land have been irrigated. In fourteen counties including Hejian, Qingyun, and Wuqiao, the number of people involved in irrigation has reached over 700,000, and about 100,000 mu can be irrigated every day. Some high-altitude and cold regions outside the Great Wall have also implemented ice transportation for irrigation.

The manure delivery activities have now been widely launched throughout the province. According to statistics as of February 10, the province has delivered more than 313.23 million catties of manure, accounting for 54% of the total accumulated fertilizer. In Qing County, more than 50,000 male and female commune members deliver manure every day. This county is a low-lying area, and in order to save time and deliver manure before thawing, it put forward the slogan of "Let the livestock rest, but not the people, not the carts," and launched a concentrated attack on manure delivery day and night.

The sowing of early-maturing crops has also begun. Counties in the Handan special district in the south have sown more than 200,000 mu of hyacinth beans, spring wheat, etc. Agricultural cooperatives in Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, Tianjin, Baoding and other special districts are leveling, plowing and harrowing the land, fertilizing, and irrigating.

    动手早　干劲足
    山东、河北备耕工作形成热潮
    据新华社济南23日电　山东省今年春季大生产一开始就出现劲头足、干劲猛、出勤率高的澎湃气象。据初步统计，已有五十五个县、市今年的粮食增产指标要求达到亩产四百斤至五百斤以上，增产劲头最足的黄县和寿张县都计划创造千斤县。拥有百余万亩棉田的夏津和高唐两县，今年都要创造亩产百斤皮棉县。从各专区、县所订的增产指标看，一般均比丰收的1956年还要增加50％以上，有的翻一翻甚至三翻。全省大部农业社也都制订或正在修订生产计划，并有半数以上的社已经结束或正在进行“三包、五定”工作。根据对订出计划的农业社的了解，已有上万个社要求今年的产量达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指标“亩产五百斤”，有上千个社将创造千斤社，并有部分社要求达到亩产千斤以上或双千斤。
    为了实现以上的增产目标，惠民、聊城、菏泽、泰安、临沂等专区，1月中旬就形成了送粪热潮，比去年提前二十多天。现在齐东、博兴、聊城三县每天参加积肥和送粪的有二十一万多人，最快的桓台县春田送粪已近完成。为了保好墒争取适时播种，许多地区采取化一层冻，耙一层土的办法，耙地进展非常迅速，据临清等十一个县的统计，目前已耙春田三百多万亩。各地浇灌麦田的活动也已开始。
    今年春田的施肥量，将大大超过去年。目前全省已积土肥三千八百多亿斤，除用于麦田追肥外，今年每亩春田可施底肥五千斤以上，比去年的春田底肥增加一倍半。各地种子的调运和选换工作也比往年提前进行。
    省委要求各地把春季生产高潮搞得比去冬还要好，要求规模更大、劲头更足。要求各地千方百计力争小麦丰收。省委指出这是争取1958年丰收的首要关键。省委还要求加强播种技术指导，提高播种质量，保证八千万亩春播作物适时种好、苗全苗旺。在春季生产中还应继续抓住水、肥、土三大增产关键，提前实现今年灌溉面积达到三千万亩的计划。
    据新华社保定22日电　河北省农村目前有一千三百多万人投入备耕、播种工作。
    据保定、沧县、邯郸三个专区五十五个县的统计，目前已浇地两千三百多万亩。河间、庆云、吴桥等十四个县投入浇地的达七十多万人，每天可浇十万亩左右。塞外一些高寒地区还实行了搬冰浇地。
    现在全省的送粪活动已普遍展开。截至2月10日的统计，全省已送出粪肥三千一百三十二亿三千多万斤，占已积肥料总数的54％。青县每天送粪的男女社员达五万多人，这个县是低洼地区，为争取时间在化冻前送粪，提出“歇牲口、不歇人、不歇车”的口号，昼夜突击送粪。
    早熟作物的播种工作也已经开始。南部邯郸专区各县已播种扁豆、春麦等二十多万亩。邢台、石家庄、沧县、天津、保定等专区的农业社正在平整、耕耙土地，施肥，灌水。
