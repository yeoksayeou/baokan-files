    Agricultural Cooperatives' 1957 Distribution Work Generally Good
    Public Accumulation Universally Expanded
    Majority of Commune Members' Income Increased, Households in Debt Reduced
    (By Our Own Correspondent) According to initial information from relevant departments: in the year-end distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in various regions in 1957, the relationship between the state, the agricultural cooperatives, and the commune members was handled relatively thoughtfully. The proportion of agricultural cooperatives' increased production and commune members' increased income increased compared to the past, public accumulation generally increased, and households in debt decreased.
    According to statistics from more than 117,000 cooperatives in six provinces—Hebei, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou—and Beijing: cooperatives with increased production accounted for 78.58%, those with stable production accounted for 10.1%, and those with reduced production accounted for 11.32%. In Hebei Province, 80% of cooperatives and over 80% of farming households increased their income. In the suburban areas of Beijing, 80% of the cooperatives increased production, 92.9% of the commune members increased their income, and households with decreased income accounted for 7.1%. The main reason for the reduction in income was the impact of natural disasters.
    On the premise of increased production and ensuring increased income for commune members, agricultural cooperatives in various regions generally expanded public accumulation and increased investment in production and grain reserves. According to reports, the public accumulation funds of agricultural cooperatives in provinces such as Shaanxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jilin generally increased from 3% of total income in the previous year to 5%-8%. Heilongjiang Province plans to increase it to 13%-15% of net income. The public accumulation funds of agricultural cooperatives in Tongren and Zunyi areas of Guizhou Province increased by about double compared to the previous year. In addition, some cooperatives, while increasing public accumulation and ensuring the completion of state grain purchase tasks, also retained a certain amount of grain reserves. Incomplete statistics from agricultural cooperatives in Hunan and Guizhou provinces show that they retained a total of over 400 million jin of grain reserves, averaging about 10,000 jin per cooperative. More than 30% of the cooperatives in Hebei Province retained grain reserves.
    The number of households with overdrafts and those who received nothing in the distribution was also reduced compared to the past. According to a survey of some cooperatives in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, households with overdrafts generally accounted for about 15% of the total number of commune members. The number of households whose food grain allocation was insufficient relying on labor income also decreased compared to the past.
    However, there are also some noteworthy problems in the distribution: First, according to reports from Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Yunnan, and other provinces, the phenomena of concealing production, privately distributing, selling less surplus grain, and attempting to default on state grain purchase tasks are quite common when distributing grain. In severe cases of concealing production, such as in Yishan area of Guangxi Province, 440 cooperatives were found to have concealed 17 million jin of output, averaging 40,000 jin per cooperative. Second, in expanding public accumulation, the two tendencies of "deducting less and distributing more" and "deducting more and distributing less" coexist, but the phenomenon of "deducting less and distributing more," i.e., being able to accumulate more but not actively increasing accumulation, is the main one. For example, among 142 cooperatives in Lingle County, Guangxi Province, 84 had low deductions, and 14 cooperatives did not retain any public welfare fund or public accumulation fund at all. Among 288 cooperatives with increased production in Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, 53.12% did not retain production expenses for the next year when formulating distribution plans, 41.11% retained a portion, and only 5.77% retained enough.

    农业社1957年度分配工作一般良好
    公共积累普遍扩大
    绝大部分社员收入增加，超支户减少
    本报讯　据有关部门初步了解：各地农业社1957年年终分配工作中，国家、农业社和社员三方面的关系处理得比较周到。农业社的增产和社员增加收入的比重比过去增加，公共积累普遍增多了，超支户减少了。
    据河北、陕西、浙江、湖北、四川、贵州六省和北京市十一万七千多个社的统计：增产的社占78.58％，平产的占10.1％，减产的占11.32％。河北省有80％的社和80％以上的农户都增加了收入。北京市郊区80％的社增产，92.9％的社员增加了收入，减收户占7.1％，减收的主要原因是由于受到自然灾害的影响。
    各地农业社在增产和保证社员增加收入的前提下，一般都扩大了公共积累，增加了生产投资和储备粮。据了解，陕西、广西、湖南、浙江、吉林等省农业社的公积金，一般由前年占总收入3％提高到5％—8％。黑龙江省计划提高到占纯收入的13％—15％。贵州铜仁、遵义两专区农业社的公积金比前年增加一倍左右。此外，有些社在增加公共积累、保证完成国家征购任务的情况下，还留了一定数量的储备粮。湖南、贵州两省农业社不完全统计，共留储备粮四亿多斤，每社平均一万斤左右。河北省有30％以上的社留了储备粮。
    分配中超支户和分空户也比过去减少。据江苏、浙江一部分社调查，超支户一般占社员总数15％左右。依靠劳动收入口粮分配不足的户也比过去减少。
    但分配中也有一些值得注意的问题：一、据广东、浙江、河南、云南等省反映，在分配粮食时，瞒产、私分、少卖余粮、企图拖欠国家征购任务的现象相当普遍。瞒产严重的，如广西省宜山专区四百四十个社就核出产量一千七百万斤，平均每社瞒产四万斤。二、在扩大公共积累上，“少扣多分”和“多扣少分”两种偏向同时存在，而“少扣多分”、能够多积累而不积极增加积累的现象是主要的。如广西省凌乐县一百四十二社中有八十四个扣留偏低，有十四个社根本没留公积金和公益金。广东省开平县二百八十八个增产社制定分配方案中，没留次年生产费的占53.12％，留一部分的占41.11％，留足的仅5.77％。
