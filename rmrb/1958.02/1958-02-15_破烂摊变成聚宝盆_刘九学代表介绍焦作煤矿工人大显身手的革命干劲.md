From Junk Heap to Treasure Trove
Representative Liu Jiuxue Introduces the Revolutionary Drive of Jiaozuo Coal Mine Workers

    I fully support the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and guarantee to resolutely implement them in my work. Now I will report on the situation of our mine.

    Jiaozuo Coal Mine Regains Youth: Annual Output Reaches Over 2 Million Tons
    Our Jiaozuo Coal Mine's main production mines during the First Five-Year Plan were "old junk heaps" that had been plundered by British and Japanese imperialists for more than forty years. At that time, the annual output was only 400,000 to 500,000 tons. After vigorous restoration, expansion, and new construction after liberation, as of last year, the annual output had reached 2.4 million tons. Jiaozuo Mine has regained its youth. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of Jiaozuo Coal Mine have overcome many production difficulties, such as severe water inrush, super-high gas levels, and scattered transportation. They have painstakingly studied and collectively created many ingenious coal mining methods that can adapt to various harsh environments and special difficulties, such as "repeated construction," "skyward chute four-face mining," "excavating gangue to find coal," and "crawling to find coal." They have promoted fifteen types of small-scale mechanized tools that do not require state investment, freeing more than 1,300 workers from heavy manual labor. By adhering to the principles of "more, faster, better, and more economical," "building the country diligently and thriftily, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily," and "safe production," the workers have shown great skill, "turning the junk heap into a treasure trove." Over the past five years, they have mined more than 9.9 million tons of high-quality coal, completed the First Five-Year Plan target 81 days ahead of schedule, and overproduced 610,000 tons of coal, turning over more than 4.5 million yuan in profits, accumulating enough funds for the state to build ten pairs of modern mines with an annual output of 300,000 tons or more, achieving great results.

    Workers' Awareness Greatly Increased: Advanced Creations are Endless
    Our coal mining team, together with all the mine's workers, under the correct leadership of the Party and government and the promotion of the trade union and Communist Youth League organizations, after a series of political movements over the past five years, especially participating in the nationwide rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, and the socialist education movement, the class consciousness of all workers has been greatly improved. They have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm in production, creating and promoting "wooden plank false roofs," "longwall mining method," "Soviet one-shift coal mining system," "integrated operation of mechanical and electrical workers," "advanced support rock support," "pit wood substitutes," and other advanced methods and experiences, greatly improving labor productivity, saving a lot of materials and funds, and completing the state's First Five-Year Plan task for our team five months and twenty-seven days ahead of schedule. They also overproduced 64,600 tons of raw coal above the task. In terms of cost savings, they saved the state a total of more than 146,000 yuan. The cost of producing raw coal has also decreased year by year compared to the state plan. For example, in 1957, the raw coal ash content (the ratio of mud and gangue to coal) was 19% lower than the state plan, which is equivalent to increasing the production of a large amount of raw coal for the state. Labor productivity was 4.09 tons in 1953, and reached 5.17 tons last year, an increase of 26.41% compared to 1953, an average annual increase of 6% over five years. In addition to better completing the above-mentioned economic indicators, our team also paid special attention to safe production. No major personal injury or death accidents have occurred in the past five years. If calculated from 1949, there have been no major injury or death accidents for nine years, which has played a considerable role in the workers' peace of mind and active production. Production was completed comprehensively ahead of schedule and beyond the target. The workers' living standards and welfare have also gradually improved significantly. More importantly, some operational techniques and safe production experience have been initially acquired, and a group of technical new forces mastering longwall coal mining have been trained for the country, laying a good foundation for the successful completion of the state's task for our team in the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Propose to Launch a New Upsurge to Support the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture
    Relying on the leadership of the Party, acting according to the Party's guidelines and policies for coal mining enterprises, believing in the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of workers, organizing mass roof management committees, and carrying out ideological mobilization and technical research through team and group backbones, and constantly criticizing conservative thinking are the basic experiences for completing the above-mentioned production tasks.

    Although our team has achieved great results, there are still many shortcomings in our work. We are not satisfied with the past, but look forward to the future with confidence. The call made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel or other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more is a great encouragement to us. At the end of last year, our team issued a proposal to all employees in the province to launch a new upsurge in production. As a result, our team has achieved the target of increasing coal production by 21,490 tons by the end of 1957, ahead of schedule by three days and over-fulfilling the target by 0.35%.

    Now, our Jiaozuo City Congress of the Communist Party of China has proposed to march towards the Second Five-Year Plan, organize a new upsurge in industrial production, and support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. In the next five years, it will increase Jiaozuo's coal output from 2.4 million tons last year to 6 million tons. I believe that this ambitious plan can be completed under the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all mine workers.

    破烂摊变成聚宝盆
    刘九学代表介绍焦作煤矿工人大显身手的革命干劲
    我完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任所作的报告，并保证在工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我报告一下我矿的情况。
    焦作煤矿恢复青春　年产达二百多万吨
    我们焦作煤矿在第一个五年计划期间的主要生产矿井，是曾经被英、日帝国主义者所掠夺过四十多年的“老破烂摊”，那时年产量也不过是四、五十来万吨，解放后，经过大力恢复扩建和新建，截至去年，年产量已达二百四十万吨，焦作矿已恢复了它的青春。五年来，焦作煤矿的职工们，在党的领导下，克服了涌水特大、瓦斯超级、运输分散等生产上的许多困难，刻苦钻研集体创造了能够适应各种恶劣环境和特殊的困难的“重复修建”、“溜天四采”、“刨矸找煤”、“爬行找煤”等许多奇妙的采煤方法，推广了十五种不需要国家投资的小型机械化工具，解放了一千三百多工人的笨重体力劳动，在坚持贯彻“多、快、好、省”、“勤俭建国、勤俭办企业”的方针和“安全生产”的原则下，工人们大显身手，“把破烂摊变成了聚宝盆”，五年来挖掘出优质煤炭九百九十多万吨，提前八十一天完成了第一个五年计划指标，并超额增产了煤炭六十一万吨，上缴利润四百五十多万元，为国家积累的资金足够建设十对年产三十万吨以上的现代化矿井，取得了很大的成绩。
    工人觉悟大大提高　先进创造无穷无尽
    我们采煤队和全矿职工一起，在党、政的正确领导和工会、共青团组织的推动下，经过五年来一系列的政治运动，特别是参加了全民性的整风、反右派斗争和社会主义教育的运动后，全体职工的阶级觉悟大大提高，在生产中发挥了高度的劳动积极性，创造和推广了“木板假顶”、“长壁式采煤法”、“苏联一班采煤制”、“机电工交叉作业”、“超前支架托岩?”、“坑木代用品”等等先进的方法和经验，大大提高了劳动生产率，节约了大量的材料和资金，提前五个月零二十七天完成了国家给我队的第一个五年计划的任务，还超任务多产了原煤六万四千六百吨，在成本节约上，共计给国家节约十四万六千余元。生产原煤的成本也逐年较国家计划降低，如一九五七年度原煤含?率（泥?占煤比重）较国家计划降低百分之十九，等于为国家增产了大量原煤。劳动生产率一九五三年为四点零九吨，到了去年就达到五点一七吨，比一九五三年提高了百分之二十六点四一，在五年内平均每年递增百分之六。我队除了较好地完成了上述各项经济指标外，还特别注意安全生产，五年来没有发生过重大的人身伤亡事故，如果从一九四九年算起，就是九年没有发生重大的伤亡事故了，这对工人的安心积极生产，起了相当的作用。生产全面地提前超额完成了，职工们的生活福利也逐步有了很大的提高，更重要的是初步地取得了一些操作技术和安全生产的经验，为国家培养了一批掌握长壁式采煤的技术新生力量，为胜利完成第二个五年计划国家给我队的任务，打下了良好基础。
    倡议掀起新高潮　支援农业大跃进
    依靠党的领导，根据党对煤矿企业提出方针政策办事，相信广大工人群众的智慧和力量，组织了群众性的顶板管理委员会，通过班组骨干进行思想动员与技术研究等工作，不断地批判保守思想，是完成上述生产任务的基本经验。
    我们队虽然取得了很大的成绩，但我们的工作中还存在着许多缺点。我们并不满足于过去，而是满怀信心地展望着将来。党中央和毛主席提出的十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁或其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的号召，对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。去年年末，我队曾向全省职工发出掀起生产新高潮倡议，结果我队已提前三天超额百分之零点三五，实现了倡议中到一九五七年底再增产煤炭二万一千四百九十吨的指标。
    现在我们中共焦作市代表大会已经提出向第二个五年计划进军，组织工业生产新高潮，支援农业生产大跃进，在今后五年内把焦作的煤炭产量由去年的二百四十万吨，提高到六百万吨，我相信这个豪迈的计划，在党的正确领导与全矿职工的努力下，一定能够完成。
