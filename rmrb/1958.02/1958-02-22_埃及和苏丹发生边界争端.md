Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 21st: Egypt and Sudan have recently had a dispute over border issues. The Egyptian government issued a statement on the 18th saying that the Sudanese government's action of including the area north of 22 degrees north latitude into the Sudanese electoral district and dispatching troops to that area violates the 1899 agreement and undermines Egyptian sovereignty. At the same time, the Sudanese government also leveled accusations against Egypt. Sudan believes that the area mentioned by Egypt has been under Sudanese jurisdiction since 1902, and Egypt has not previously made any claims to this area.

The territory in dispute between the two countries includes a tribal inhabited area of approximately 10,000 square miles north of 22 degrees north latitude along the Red Sea coast, and a small area north of 22 degrees near Wadi Halfa on the Nile River. The population living in these two areas is approximately 60,000. Egypt has announced that it will hold a referendum in these areas on February 21 regarding the establishment of the United Arab Republic. Sudan has also included these areas as electoral districts for the Sudanese general election scheduled for February 27.

    埃及和苏丹发生边界争端
    据新华社开罗21日电埃及和苏丹最近发生了边界问题的争执。埃及政府在18日发表声明说，苏丹政府把北纬二十二度以北的地区划入苏丹的选区，并且调派军队到那个地区去，这个行动违反了1899年协定，并且破坏了埃及的主权。同时，苏丹政府也对埃及提出指责。苏丹认为，埃及提到的这块地区从1902年起就在苏丹的管辖下，埃及过去没有提出过对于这个地区的要求。
    两国发生争执的领土包括红海沿岸北纬二十二度以北一块约一万平方英里的部落居住地区，以及在尼罗河畔瓦迪哈尔法附近二十二度以北一小块地区。在这两个地区居住的人口约有六万。埃及宣布要在2月21日在这些地区举行关于成立阿拉伯联合共和国的公民投票。苏丹也把这些地区列为订于2月27日举行的苏丹大选的选区。
