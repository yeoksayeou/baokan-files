Title: Song of the Spring of 1958

This happened at the end of January this year,
South of the Yangtze River, spring grass sprouts, north of the Yellow River, the ice weakens,
One day it was late at night, Yuansheng came to visit me,
After only a few words of greeting, suddenly tears streamed down his face.
I asked him, "Is your wife well? Why are you so upset?"
He said, "Lin Xian is well, and I am also okay,
But during the rectification campaign, I was severely criticized.
You know, last spring, the fire of self-criticism was first lit,
The rightists had treacherous intentions, taking the opportunity to encroach,
For a time, it was difficult to distinguish between poppies and dandelions.
A certain professor at the academy was very active at that time,
Writing articles on 'early spring,' his words were venomous but euphemistic,
I once felt the same way and said it to others,
Now that I think about it, it was a terrible mistake.
But my loyalty to the Party is as strong as ever,
Can you speak to the organization on my behalf?"
I said, "No need to say anything, the Party is very correct,
It severely criticized you, but it treated you kindly,
It didn't label you a 'rightist' and fight against you,
You should examine yourself; bitter medicine is good for you.
Quickly respond to the call, leave your desk,
Go to the workers and peasants, and share their joys and sorrows."
Yuansheng listened to my advice and resolved to change his life,
"Let's go and take a look," he followed me out of the city,
The farmers of Laojuntang, forgetting hunger and thirst, were dredging the river;
Some were carrying mud, some were building the embankment foot,
They raised thousand-jin stones together, lifting and shouting in unison!
Yuansheng, seeing this situation, pondered in his heart:
"We have the same parents, why do we feel so different?
I fear the cold in heavy fur coats, while they work shirtless?"
Then we visited Mentougou, and Yuansheng followed along,
Changing into a worker's uniform, wearing a rattan helmet,
The helmet was equipped with a small electric light, with a battery tucked in his belt.
Down the well three hundred feet, there were new landscapes,
The cold wind came from the bottom of the well, freezing us to shivers.
Yuansheng asked the miners, "Aren't you cold?"
The miners smiled without answering, their faces black, their eyes bright.
They would rather keep ten thousand families warm than care about their own tattered clothes;
Returning in the same vehicle, Yuansheng sat in silence,
I asked, "What do you think?" He said, "I have gained something.
I couldn't figure it out before, but now I know how vast the world is;
I used to be very conceited, but now I know I was worthless."
After Yuansheng parted ways, we lost contact for a week,
Suddenly I received a letter from him, sent from Eastern E:
"My hometown has changed greatly in recent years,
The wasteland has become fertile land, and the canal water flows vigorously.
Hundreds of generations of farmers are digging water weirs,
Trying to plant double-cropping rice, promoting oats and barley,
Fish and carp leap in the ponds, and cows and sheep produce rich dairy products.
The great leap forward in production is unstoppable,
Things that seemed impossible are all being done;
Why was I so indifferent to this in the past!?
Fortunately, Chairman Mao earnestly struck the wooden clapper,
After the prefectural committee talked to me, I rejoiced like a sparrow,
Preparing for twenty years of large-scale wasteland reclamation,
Hoe in hand, shoes and socks already off,
I suddenly feel energized and unafraid of the cutting wind.
Lin Xian is burdened with the children, and I temporarily entrust them to you,
Tell her I am not suffering; even eating coarse food is acceptable.
Waiting only for the conditions to build a small thatched cottage,
To bring her to farm together, not envying Nanyang Ge."
After reading Yuansheng's letter, I felt ashamed of myself,
I advised him to go down, but I am still bound,
The motherland is not lonely in 1958.
The people are working hard, each one surpassing the other,
Yuansheng is also moving forward, how can I retreat?
In late March in Yanjing, I will cross the Yellow River and Luo River,
You build roads, and I will level the bumps,
You accumulate fertilizer, and I will add a dipper of manure,
The spring breeze blows across the earth, and flowers bloom everywhere.
Paradise emerges in the world, astonishing the returning cranes!

    歌一九五八年之春
    田汉
    此事发生在　今年一月末，
    江南春草生，河北坚冰弱，
    某日已深夜，远生来访我，
    寒暄才几句，忽然双泪落。
    问他“妻可好，何以心情恶？”
    他说“林娴好，自己也还可，
    只是整风时，狠狠受批驳。
    你知去年春，烧身初引火，
    右派心肠险，乘机想侵夺，
    一时很难分，罂粟与杜若。
    学院某教授，当时很活跃，
    著文论‘早春’，心毒话婉约，
    我曾有同感，对人也说过，
    现在想起来，真是天大错。
    可是我对党，忠心犹如昨，
    能否对组织，替我说一说？”
    我说“不用说，党是很正确，
    狠狠批评你，待你却不薄，
    没有当‘右派’，把你相斗搏，
    你该自省察，苦口是良药。
    快快应号召，离开办公桌，
    走向工农中，与他共苦乐。”
    远生听我劝，决心改生活，
    “先去看看吧”，随我离城郭，
    老君堂农民，开河忘饥渴；
    有的挑泥土，有的筑堤脚，
    齐举千斤石，一举一吆喝！
    远生见此情，心里自揣度：
    “同是父母肉，何以异感觉，
    我怯重裘寒，他们打赤膊？” 
    旋访门头沟，远生也跟着，
    换上青工服，戴上藤帽壳，
    帽装小电灯，电池掖腰槖。
    下井三百呎，别有新丘壑，
    井底寒风来，冻得打哆嗦。
    远生问矿工：“你们可冷么？”
    矿工笑不答，脸黑眼灼灼。
    宁愿万家暖，哪顾一身破；
    回去同车辆，远生默然坐，
    我问“意如何？”他说“有收获。
    以前想不通，才知天地阔；
    以前很自负，才知是糟粕。”
    远生分手后，周来失联络，
    忽然得他信，远寄自东鄂：
    “故乡这几年，大大改面目，
    荒原成沃壤，渠水流活泼。
    农人千百辈，水堰正开凿，
    试种双季稻，推广燕麦稞，
    鱼鲤跃池塘，牛羊富乳酪。
    生产大跃进，其势不可遏，
    以为不可能，件件都在作；
    何以我过去　对此心淡漠！？
    幸而毛主席，谆谆击木铎，
    地委谈过后，欢跃如家雀，
    准备二十年，生荒大开拓，
    锄头拿在手，鞋袜亦已脱，
    顿觉气力来，不怕风如削。
    林娴累儿女，暂时相拜托，
    告她我不苦，菜根殊可嚼。
    只等有条件，聚茅结小阁，
    接她同躬耕，不羡南阳葛。”
    读完远生信，反觉自惭怍，
    我劝他下去，自己尚羁缚，
    一九五八年，祖国不寂寞。
    人民干劲大，一个赛一个，
    远生也向前，难道我退却？
    燕京三月暮，我将过河洛，
    你们修道路，我也平坎坷，
    你们积肥粪，我也添斗勺，
    春风吹大地，满眼舞花萼。
    人间涌天堂，惊煞归来鹤！
                    2月8日作
