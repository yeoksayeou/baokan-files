Representative Da Pusheng said that using Mandarin Chinese as the common language of the country and Chinese characters as the universal writing system is of great benefit to consolidating the unity of all ethnic groups in our country, enabling our ethnic minorities to receive help from the Han Chinese elder brother, and to learn from the Han Chinese elder brother, and to the development of our various ethnic minorities.
I fully agree with the reports of Vice Chairman Peng, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. I support the congress's serious handling of bourgeois right-wingers.
Regarding the benefits of the work of simplifying Chinese characters and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme for improving the cultural level of the Chinese people and promoting the socialist construction cause, Director Wu Yuzhang has already made a comprehensive explanation, and I wholeheartedly support it. I am a member of an ethnic minority, and I would like to offer some opinions on the work of language reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme from the perspective of ethnic minorities.
I believe that the simplification of Chinese characters and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme are not only a great boon for the Han Chinese working people, but also a great boon for the people of our ethnic minorities. Today, our country has achieved unprecedented unity and unification in politics, economy, and culture. The greatest interest of all ethnic groups in the country is to consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups and strive for the common goal of building socialism. In addition to using their own ethnic languages and scripts, all ethnic groups in the country urgently need a common national language and a universally used national script. Mandarin Chinese is the most appropriate common language in the country, and Chinese characters are the most appropriate universal writing system in the country.
Using Mandarin Chinese as the common language of the country and Chinese characters as the universal writing system is not only because 600 million people in the country use Mandarin Chinese and Chinese characters—in fact, Mandarin Chinese and Chinese characters have become the common language and universal writing system of the country—but also because doing so is of great benefit to the progress and development of our ethnic minorities. Because the Han Chinese not only account for 94 percent of the country's total population, but also are the most advanced ethnic group in our country in terms of politics, economy, and culture, and are the elder brother of all ethnic groups in our country. If the ethnic minorities in our country want to change their backward state and develop into advanced socialist ethnic groups, they cannot do without the help of the Han Chinese elder brother, and they cannot do without learning from the Han Chinese brothers. Using Mandarin Chinese as the common language of the country and Chinese characters as the universal writing system is of great benefit to consolidating the unity of all ethnic groups in our country, enabling our ethnic minorities to receive help from the Han Chinese elder brother, and to learn from the Han Chinese elder brother, and to the development of our various ethnic minorities.
It is often difficult for our ethnic minorities to learn Mandarin Chinese and Chinese characters. Our Hui ethnic group uses the same language and writing system as the Han Chinese; Mandarin Chinese and Chinese characters are the language and writing system of the Hui ethnic group. This is where the Hui people have an advantage over other ethnic minorities. However, because the Hui people are scattered in various places, the dialects in various places are not entirely the same, and it takes several years to learn to recognize and use Chinese characters, so there are many illiterate people. Now that the simplification of Chinese characters and the promotion of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme have made it easier for people of all ethnic groups to learn Mandarin, learn Chinese characters, improve their culture, and learn the advanced experience of the Han Chinese in all aspects more quickly; and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is also used as a common basis for the creation of scripts by ethnic minorities in our country; this also makes it easier for the Han Chinese people to learn the culture of ethnic minorities, and is more conducive to the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country, conducive to the mutual assistance and mutual learning of all ethnic groups, and conducive to the cause of socialist construction. How can our ethnic minorities not wholeheartedly support such a great good thing that has a common interest for all ethnic groups?
I propose that we should actively promote the work of simplifying Chinese characters and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, and we should also be enthusiastic and make a great leap forward in this work.

　　汉字简化和汉语拼音方案便利了少数民族学习汉字汉语
    达浦生代表说，以汉语作为全国的共同的语言，以汉字作为全国的通用文字，这对于巩固我国各族人民的团结，使我们少数民族接受汉族老大哥的帮助，向汉族老大哥学习，对于我们各个少数民族的发展都是有很大益处的。
    我完全同意彭副委员长、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任的报告。拥护大会对资产阶级右派分子的严肃处理。
    关于汉字简化工作和汉语拼音方案，对于提高我国人民文化水平、促进社会主义建设事业的益处，吴玉章主任已经作了全面的说明，我衷心拥护。我是一个少数民族，我想从少数民族方面对文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案问题，谈一点意见。
    我认为简化汉字工作和汉语拼音方案，不仅对于汉族劳动人民是一件大好事，就是对我们少数民族的人民，也是一件极大的好事。今天，我们国家在政治、经济、文化上实现了空前的团结和统一，全国各族人民的最大利益就是巩固各民族的团结，为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗。全国各族人民除了使用本族的语言文字外，还迫切需要一种全国共同的语言和全国通用的文字。汉语就是全国最适当的共同语言，汉文就是全国最适当的通用文字。
    以汉语作为全国的共同语言，以汉字作为全国的通用文字，不仅是由于全国有六万万人使用汉语、汉文，事实上汉语、汉文已成为全国的共同语言和通用文字，还因为这样做对我们少数民族进步和发展有很大益处。因为汉族不仅在人口方面占全国人口总数的百分之九十四，而且在政治、经济、文化等方面都是我国最先进的民族，是我们全国各个民族的老大哥。我国各少数民族要改变自己的落后状态，要发展成为社会主义的先进民族，没有汉族老大哥的帮助是不行的，不向汉族兄弟学习是不行的。以汉语作为全国的共同语言，以汉字作为全国的通用文字，这对于巩固我国各族人民的团结，使我们少数民族接受汉族老大哥的帮助，向汉族老大哥学习，对于我们各个少数民族的发展都是有很大益处的。
    我们少数民族学习汉语、汉文，常常感到有很大的困难，不容易学。我们回回民族是和汉族使用同一语言和文字的；汉语、汉文就是回回民族的语言和文字。这是回族较其它少数民族更为有利的地方。但是由于回族分居各地，各地的方言也不尽同，汉文也得好几年的功夫才能会认、会用，所以文盲很多。现在简化汉字工作和汉语拼音方案推广以后，就能更便于我们各族人民学习普通话，学习汉字，提高文化，能够更快地学习汉族各方面的先进经验；而汉语拼音方案又作为我国少数民族创造文字的共同基础；这样也便于汉族人民学习少数民族的文化，也更有利于全国各族人民的大团结，有利于各族人民的互助、互学，有利于社会主义建设事业。这种对各族人民有共同利益的极大的好事，我们少数民族怎能不衷心地拥护呢。
    我提议，我们应该积极地推进汉字简化工作和汉语拼音方案，在这个工作方面也应该鼓起干劲，来一个大跃进。
