    What is the Road to Solving the Seed Problem?

    Under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the agricultural departments of Shaanxi Province conducted a survey of crop varieties throughout the province last year and discovered many excellent varieties among the more than five thousand varieties grown by farmers. Cultivating and promoting these varieties will greatly help to solve the shortage of good seeds this year. We feel that the approach taken by the agricultural leaders in Shaanxi is very good, and especially that their spirit of following the mass line to solve the seed problem is even better.

    This year, many regions will expand the area of multiple cropping and change their farming systems, creating a large demand for seeds. At present, a large-scale inter-regional seed transfer is underway, but it is far from meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production. Solving the seed problem should never rely solely on state supply, but should face the masses and rely on the masses to solve it.

    解决种子问题的道路何在？
    在农业大跃进的形势推动下，陕西省农业部门去年对全省农作物品种作了调查，在五千多个农家品种中发现了许多优良品种。培育和推广这些品种，对于解决今年良种不足将有很大的作用。我们感到陕西农业领导部门采取的这个办法很好，尤其感到他们走群众路线解决种子问题的精神更好。
    今年，许多地区都将扩大复种面积和改变耕作制，对种子需要量很大。目前地区之间大量调剂种子的工作正在进行，但是，它远不能适应生产大跃进的需要。解决种子问题绝不应该持单纯依靠国家供给，而应该面向群众，依靠群众来解决。
