　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 4th: According to the Vietnamese "People's Daily," before the International Commission headquarters in Vietnam moved from Hanoi to Saigon, the Chairman of the International Commission, Ambassador Gokhale of the Indian delegation, Gularski of the Polish delegation, and Carter of the Canadian delegation, paid a farewell visit to President Ho Chi Minh at the Presidential Palace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the afternoon of the 3rd.

　　President Ho Chi Minh welcomed the International Commission's efforts to consolidate peace and ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords, despite the difficult environment. President Ho Chi Minh expressed his deep belief that the International Commission will continue its efforts to ensure respect for the Geneva Accords and contribute to the consolidation of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. He wished the International Commission greater success. President Ho Chi Minh said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in the spirit of respecting and strictly implementing the Geneva Accords, will continue to assist the International Commission as it has in the past and will work together with the Commission.

　　President Ho Chi Minh said that in the current situation, the idea of peaceful consultation has seen new development in the world. All issues between countries can be resolved through peaceful consultation. North and South Vietnam are two parts of one country, and there is no reason why the authorities on both sides cannot come together through talks to realize the urgent desire of all Vietnamese people to reunify their country peacefully as soon as possible. President Ho Chi Minh said: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is ready at any time to discuss with the Southern regime any methods aimed at unifying the country on the basis of the Geneva Accords. He said he hoped that the Southern regime would respond to the reasonable proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the desire of the people of the whole country to hold consultative conferences to discuss the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords, first of all, to establish normal relations between the two sides.

　　胡志明主席接见国际委员会代表团团长
    重申和平统一越南的愿望
    据新华社河内4日电　据越南“人民报”报道，在越南国际委员会总部从河内迁往西贡以前，国际委员会主席、印度代表团团长高尔大使，波兰代表团团长古拉尔斯基和加拿大代表团团长卡特，3日下午到越南民主共和国主席府向胡志明主席辞行。
    胡志明主席对国际委员会不顾环境的困难，仍然为巩固和平和保证日内瓦协议的实施而努力进行活动表示欢迎。胡志明主席表示深信国际委员会将继续努力使日内瓦协议获得尊重，为巩固越南和东南亚的和平作出贡献。他祝国际委员会将获得更大的成就。胡志明主席说，越南民主共和国政府本着尊重和严正实施日内瓦协议的精神，将同过去一样继续帮助国际委员会，并且同委员会一起工作。
    胡志明主席说，在目前的形势下，世界上和平协商的思想有着新的发展。各国间的一切问题都可以用和平协商的方法解决。北越和南越是一个国家的两部分，双方当局没有理由不能在一起通过会谈来早日实现越南全体人民以和平方法统一祖国的迫切愿望。胡志明主席说：越南民主共和国政府随时准备同南方政权共同探讨目的在于在日内瓦协议的基础上统一国家的任何办法。他说，希望南方政权对越南民主共和国的合理建议和全国人民关于举行协商会议以讨论继续实施日内瓦协议、首先是建立双方间正常关系问题的愿望给予回答。
