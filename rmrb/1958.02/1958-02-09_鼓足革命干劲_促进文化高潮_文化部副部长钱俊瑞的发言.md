Now, our motherland is truly a spring garden that cannot be confined, revealing a vigorous spirit and a thriving scene everywhere. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the entire Chinese people are experiencing one revolution after another, one victory after another. How can a truly liberated great nation not burst forth with the infinite potential accumulated over millennia? How can it not radiate its immense brilliance to the world? Our country's enormous social productive forces, after the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, have been thoroughly liberated, how can they not develop by leaps and bounds? And "workers and laborers are the primary productive force of all mankind" (Lenin), how can our worker-peasant laborers not be as lively as dragons and tigers, making mountains bow their heads and rivers give way, displaying the heroic spirit of turning the world upside down? Precisely because of this, I fully agree with the two reports by Vice Premiers Li and Bo, because they appropriately express the firm will and correct steps of our 600 million people to stride forward and strive for a new leap forward.

The vast majority of cultural workers deeply feel the necessity of thorough transformation, and a cultural movement oriented towards and deeply rooted in workers and peasants has gradually taken shape

China's intellectuals, China's cultural workers, have been constantly tempered and transformed in our people's continuous revolution. However, the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle that began last year gave them the most profound impression and the greatest impact. This socialist revolution on the political and ideological front gave them a real revolutionary shock. The vast majority of cultural workers have drawn a clear line with the Rightists in the anti-Rightist struggle, and at the same time deeply felt the necessity of further transformation – to be completely liberated from the influence of that narrow, vulgar, and despicable bourgeois worldview. Their awareness has been raised, and their creative enthusiasm and revolutionary zeal have also been greatly enhanced. Now, a large number of writers and artists have already gone or are going to factories and rural areas to participate in labor training, or to participate in grassroots work. They are determined to unconditionally and permanently integrate themselves with the worker-peasant masses. A nationwide cultural movement oriented towards workers and peasants, deeply rooted in workers and peasants, and serving workers and peasants wholeheartedly is gradually taking shape. Composers in Shanghai have formulated a plan to compose 1,500 mass songs this year. Musicians in Beijing have proposed the initiative of establishing contact with a mass amateur music group for each person. Drama, opera, song and dance, acrobatics, and ballad singing troupes across the country are all going to the countryside, mountains, factories, and mines in a planned way to conduct touring performances. Many art troupes go deep into remote mountainous areas, old revolutionary base areas, mining areas, and forest areas, traversing mountains and ridges, performing while participating in physical labor. Many art workers are creating a large number of New Year pictures and comic strips. The Shanghai art circles have initiated a mass art movement. Filmmakers are enthusiastically producing and screening rural films. A new atmosphere of better serving the broad masses of worker-peasant-soldier readers has also emerged in the publishing industry.

Facts have proved that the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle are indeed the most fundamental driving forces for the vast number of cultural workers in our country to boost their revolutionary zeal and strive for a new leap forward. All our cultural workers should, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, and while striving to continue to complete the rectification campaign, further boost their enthusiasm, closely cooperate with the new leap forward on the industrial and agricultural fronts, resolutely implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, go deep into the masses, especially into the rural areas, better integrate with the worker-peasant masses, and conduct universal, in-depth, and arduous cultural propaganda work to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the central link in the current work of all cultural institutions and cultural workers. In 1958, we must make a great leap forward in this area, fulfilling our duty as the superstructure.

Developing mass self-run cultural undertakings and mass amateur cultural activities is the main direction of future cultural work

We must especially vigorously develop amateur cultural activities of the worker-peasant masses. In this regard, we have a fairly solid foundation. Currently, there are more than 500,000 mass amateur art organizations (amateur theater troupes, singing teams, instrumental ensembles, folk music societies, etc.) and about 400,000 factory and rural clubs nationwide. Through these organizations, the worker-peasant masses sing, entertain themselves, and educate themselves, playing a great role in socialist construction. Here is an example - the Tian'e Agricultural Cooperative's club in Xishui County, Hubei Province. When the Jigongshan Reservoir project of this cooperative started in November last year, all the cooperative members went to the construction site, and the club also moved to the construction site. This construction site club was in full swing. From November 22nd to 25th, it posted 140 slogans, made 24 propaganda boards, and three door bulletin boards, as well as basket bulletins, big-character posters, news flashes, and honor rolls. It exhibited "Yangtze River Bridge," "Ten Major Water Conservancy Projects," "Schematic Diagram of Water Conservancy Projects," and "Labor Attendance Rate and Labor Efficiency Competition Chart," as well as many propaganda paintings. Six loudspeakers continuously reported current events and the progress of the project, and also commended model figures and model deeds. It organized cultural and artistic activists to sing drum songs, clapper talks, and duets when the cooperative members were resting. Seeing that nine women from the seventh team were carrying more soil and running faster, the club seized the typical example, issued picture newspapers to commend them, and compiled ditties to be sung everywhere: "The seventh team's women are highly efficient, going up and carrying, everyone is like going to the front line, making contributions to water conservancy." In this way, the enthusiasm of all cooperative members was fully boosted, and labor efficiency became higher and higher. For example, sixteen members of the third team completed the task of clearing ten and a half cubic meters of soil in one evening in just over an hour. We believe that this kind of mass amateur cultural work should be greatly promoted.

Each province and city can make a plan for developing mass amateur cultural work. For example, Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, made a plan for mass cultural propaganda activities to cooperate with the great leap forward in agricultural production last winter and this spring. This plan requires the entire region to organize a cultural propaganda army of more than 500,000 people, including 2,108 professional cultural teams and 58,375 amateur cultural teams; requires the creation of 5,949 pieces of propaganda and singing materials based on typical materials from various counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives, including 321 scripts; the supply of 490,000 copies of various propaganda materials and 276 pictures; the establishment of 17 fixed exhibition rooms and 6,438 mobile exhibitions; the holding of 298 large and small opera, song, and dance performances; the compilation of 5,860 wall newspapers, 23,080 blackboard newspapers, and the arrangement of 228 propaganda windows. Specific requirements are also put forward for book reading, wired broadcasting, slides, and lectures. At the same time, it is required to develop 681 rural clubs and 63,000 propagandists. Such a plan can also be imitated in various provinces, prefectures, and counties across the country.

We suggest that all cultural organs, groups, and cultural workers across the country closely follow the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, face factories and rural areas, create a large number of new works and new films that promote the great leap forward and are loved by the masses, greatly strengthen the guidance of amateur cultural activities of worker-peasant masses, and supply them with a large amount of recreational materials. We suggest that all cultural groups and cultural workers, together with the large number of cadres currently being sent to lower levels, greatly develop mass amateur cultural activities in factories and rural areas, and, on the principle of mass voluntarism, help develop mass amateur cultural organizations, especially the organization of clubs. Vigorously developing mass self-run cultural undertakings and mass amateur cultural activities is the main direction of the active development of national cultural work in 1958, during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Professional cultural and artistic groups should focus on improving quality, doing more popularization work and guidance work for mass amateur culture, and at the same time, in accordance with the spirit of running undertakings diligently and thriftily, strictly implement streamlining and economy, and oppose extravagance and waste. It is suggested that the new theaters, cinemas, troupes, cultural centers, and film projection teams listed in the 1958 plan should be arranged in ethnic minority areas, remote areas, and new industrial areas, and they must be small in scale and should not blindly increase specifications and unit prices.

Some people say that cultural departments are "clean water yamen" (referring to departments where there is little opportunity for corruption), and there is not much waste. This statement is not in line with the facts. Of course, many cultural and artistic groups are able to run their businesses diligently and thriftily and work hard, such as a large number of film projection teams, bookstores, troupes, cultural centers, and cultural stations below the county level. However, it cannot be denied that the extravagance and waste of many cultural and artistic groups is quite serious. Currently, the Ministry of Culture is launching a vigorous anti-waste campaign in its affiliated agencies and organizations. According to the disclosed materials, it can be seen that the waste of many institutions is alarming. Here is just one example, the Central Experimental Opera House. It is a group directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, and it is very serious in terms of personnel backlog and material waste. For example, among its sixty-eight actors, there were five who performed ten to fifteen times throughout the year last year, twenty-three who performed twenty to thirty times, thirty-one who performed thirty to forty times, and the most performed forty-two times, only three people; there were six people who did not perform at all throughout the year. Its stock of costumes is as many as 5,000 pieces, and there are 800 various light bulbs. For their play "Welcome Spring Flowers," they first made twenty-one sets of costumes, and because they were not satisfactory, they were all rejected and discarded; the scenery for a house was almost three stories high, and finally, a section was sawed off before it could be moved onto the stage. The performance cost of one play "La Traviata" reached 23,000 yuan. To perform a play called "Choosing a Son-in-Law," it was rehearsed, and the scenery was also made, but it was not performed later, and now even the scenery cannot be found. The average cost of each performance of this theater is 3,000 yuan, the performance income is 1,000 yuan, and the state subsidy is 2,000 yuan. It should be stated that in the national cultural and artistic groups, the situation of waste like the Experimental Opera House is not an isolated case, and there are also more serious cases than it.

How is this serious waste phenomenon in cultural departments caused? First of all, it is because the leaders of many cultural departments and many cultural workers have serious bourgeois extravagant and wasteful ideas. They have not realized that building the country diligently and thriftily is our fundamental policy for building socialism, and that extravagance and waste is an unforgivable crime against the people. Secondly, it is because many cultural and artistic groups do not implement the policy of culture serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the close integration of cultural workers and workers, peasants, and soldiers, but are led by the nose by bourgeois literary and artistic ideas and capitalist management ideas, divorced from the masses, formalistic, competing in ostentation, and emphasizing pomp. Finally, the bureaucratic style of many cultural leading organs (primarily the Central Ministry of Culture) is the most important reason for causing waste. They have not properly managed and strictly controlled and inspected the finances, infrastructure construction, staffing, and even major policies of cultural and artistic groups in peacetime, which has caused the current serious waste situation due to long-term delays and laxity. Therefore, this time, a vigorous anti-waste campaign must be launched in cultural and artistic groups across the country. After several stages of great airing of views, great debate, great rectification, and great transformation, the extravagance and waste and the pompousness, officialdom, and lifelessness must be completely burned off with a raging fire, and a new atmosphere of diligence, thrift, hard work, and simplicity must be established. Only in this way can our cultural and artistic undertakings truly become the undertakings of the worker-peasant masses themselves and better serve them. On the basis of the anti-waste campaign, we suggest that cultural and artistic groups across the country make a plan for increasing production and practicing economy, vigorously strengthen business management, streamline institutions, save expenses, and strive to ensure that the cultural funding in 1958 can be reduced by 5% to 10% compared with the state budget, that is, saving 10 million to 20 million yuan of funds for the country; the directly affiliated units of the Central Ministry of Culture should strive to reduce expenses by 10% to 15%, that is, 6 million to 9 million yuan. It is not allowed for bourgeois ideology to attack socialism, and resolutely oppose bad plays, bad books, and bad songs, and bad dances. Finally, I want to say one more thing: We must criticize and oppose bad plays, bad books, and bad songs.

In the past year, some bourgeois intellectuals, artists, and businessmen, in order to seek personal gain and at the same time attempt to drag the new society back with the bourgeois reactionary worldview, distorted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" from the bourgeois standpoint and point of view, and brazenly performed bad plays such as "Killing Son to Report," "Big Splitting Coffin," "Living Zombie," and "Huang Shi's Daughter Tours the Underworld," distributed reactionary, absurd, and obscene bad books such as "The Last Emperor's Legend," "The Strange Hero Terrorist Party," and "Sweet as Honey," spread reactionary, lewd, and vulgar so-called "yellow songs" such as "China Night," "Crazy World," "When Will You Come Again," "Night Shanghai," and "Fragrant Wild Flowers," and promoted bad dances such as "Ap Fei Dance." This has seriously affected some young workers, peasants, especially students, making their labor and study discipline lax, their thinking degenerate, their lives corrupted, and even embarking on the road of crime and reaction.

We must recognize that the prevalence of these bad plays, bad books, bad songs, and bad dances essentially marks the bourgeois frantic attack on socialism in the ideological field. We must raise our sense of smell and conduct serious criticism of these poisonous weeds that poison and corrode the working people. When we discover the prevalence of bad plays, bad books, bad songs, and bad dances, we should promptly launch debates among the masses and conduct criticism together with the masses, so that everyone can recognize these poisonous weeds and their serious harm to socialist construction, to improve the awareness and discernment of the masses, that is, to improve the people's immunity, and turn the poisonous weeds into fertilizer. In this regard, we hope to get the close cooperation and concerted action of national people's representatives and trade unions, youth leagues, women's federations, and other relevant parties. Mr. Mei Lanfang, a famous artist in our country, and others jointly issued a call in July last year, "We don't perform bad plays." All our cultural and artistic workers serve the people and serve socialism, and should warmly respond to this just call, ensure themselves and agree not to perform bad plays, and not to spread bad books and bad songs. This is the solemn responsibility that every cultural and artistic worker in the new China should fulfill. Of course, while criticizing and struggling against poisonous weeds, we must continue to resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and never waver our determination to implement this policy because we have discovered some poisonous weeds.

Any cultural garden, if the proletariat does not occupy it, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. This is a basic law of cultural construction in the transition period. The reason why bad plays, bad books, bad songs, and bad dances still have a certain market today also shows that our socialist cultural and artistic work still has serious shortcomings. We have done very poorly in popularizing work for workers, peasants, and young people, and there are too few creations suitable for workers and peasants to read and appreciate. In the future, we must make 120,000 points of effort to create a large number of new mass songs and scripts, compile and print good popular books, carry out socialist mass singing movement, and promote good plays and good books, and occupy the mass cultural position firmly with a grand army. This is the basic construction work of our country's socialist culture. Every revolutionary cultural worker has no reason to refuse to undertake such a solemn obligation to destroy capitalism and promote socialism. We have reason to believe that we will certainly be able to do this.

　　鼓足革命干劲　促进文化高潮
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞的发言
    现在，我们的祖国真个是春色满园关不住，到处流露出蓬勃的朝气和欣欣向荣的景象。全中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，一个革命接着一个革命，一个胜利接着一个胜利。一个真正被解放了的伟大的民族，它怎能不迸发出千年万代所蕴藏着的无穷无尽的潜力呢？它怎能不向全世界放射出它的万丈光芒呢？我们国家的巨大的社会生产力，经过民主革命和社会主义革命，已经得到彻底的解放，它怎能不飞跃发展呢？而“工人、劳动者是全人类的首要生产力”（列宁），我国的工农劳动人民又怎能不生龙活虎一般，让高山为它低头，河水为它让路，显出旋乾转坤的英雄气概呢？正因为这样，我完全同意李、薄副总理的两个报告，因为它们恰当地表达了我们六亿人民迈开大步，争取新的跃进的坚强意志和正确的步子。
    绝大部分文化工作者痛感彻底改造的必要，面向工农深入工农的文化运动已逐渐形成
    我国的知识分子，我国的文化工作者，曾经在我国人民的不断革命中得到不断的锻炼和改造。但是，从去年开始的整风运动和反右派斗争，却给他们以最深刻的印象和最巨大的影响。这个政治思想战线上的社会主义革命给他们真正的革命的冲击。极大多数的文化工作者在反右派斗争中同右派划清了界限，同时痛感到自己有进一步改造——从那种窄狭的庸俗的卑鄙的资产阶级世界观的影响下彻底解放出来之必要。他们的觉悟提高了，他们的创作热忱和革命干劲也随之大大提高了。现在，大批的作家和艺术工作者已经或者正在下厂下乡，进行劳动锻炼，或者参加基层工作，他们决心无条件地、长期地和工农群众相结合。一个全国规模的面向工农，深入工农，全心全意为工农服务的文化运动已经在逐渐形成。上海的作曲家已经制定今年创作一千五百首群众歌曲的计划。北京的音乐家提出每人和一个群众业余音乐团体建立联系的倡议。全国各地的戏剧、戏曲、歌舞、杂技、曲艺团体都在有计划地下乡、上山、下厂、下矿，进行巡回演出。不少艺术团体深入偏僻山区、老区、矿区、森林地带，翻山越岭，一边演出，一边参加体力劳动。许多美术工作者在创作大量的年画和连环画，上海美术界倡议开展群众美术运动。电影工作者在热情地制作和放映农村片。出版界也出现了更好地为广大工农兵读者服务的新气象。
    事实证明，整风运动和反右派斗争确乎是使我国广大文化工作者鼓足革命干劲，争取新的跃进的最基本的推动力量。我们全体文化工作者应该在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，和努力继续完成整风运动的同时，更加鼓起干劲，密切地配合工业战线和农业战线的新跃进，坚决地贯彻为工农兵服务的方针，深入群众，特别是深入农村，更好地和工农群众结合，向广大工农兵群众进行普遍的深入的和艰苦的文化宣传工作。这是一切文化机构和文化工作者当前工作的中心环节。一九五八年我们必须在这一方面来一个大跃进，尽一种上层建筑所应尽的本分。
    发展群众自办的文化事业和群众业余文化活动是今后文化工作的主要方向
    我们要特别用力开展工农群众的业余文化活动。在这方面我们是有相当雄厚的基础的。现在全国有群众业余艺术组织（业余剧团、歌唱队、自乐组、吹歌会等）五十多万个，工厂和农村的俱乐部有四十万个左右。工农群众通过这些组织，自唱自乐，自我教育，对社会主义建设起着伟大的作用。这里可以举一个例子——湖北浠水县天鹅农业社的俱乐部。去年十一月这个合作社的鸡公山水库工程开工了，全体社员都上了工地，俱乐部也搬到了工地。这个工地俱乐部就开足马力，活动开了。从十一月二十二日到二十五日，它张贴了一百四十张标语，办了二十四块鼓动牌，三块门板报，还办了筐报、大字报、喜报和光荣榜。它展出了“长江大桥”、“水利十大建设”、“水利工程示意图”和“劳动出勤率和劳动效率竞赛图”，以及许多宣传画。六个广播筒不停地报告时事和工程进展状况，还表扬模范人物和模范事迹。它组织文娱积极分子，当社员休息的时候，演唱鼓书、快板和对唱。俱乐部看到七队九个妇女挑土挑得多，跑得快，就抓住典型，出画报表扬，编了顺口溜，叫到处唱：“七队妇女效率高，上的上来挑的挑，个个都像上火线，兴修水利立功劳。”这样，全体社员的干劲被鼓得足足的，劳动效率越来越高。像三队十六个社员在一个晚上一个多钟头就完成了十方半土的清基任务。我们认为这种群众业余文化工作应该大大提倡。
    各省、市对于发展群众业余文化工作都可以来个规划。例如湖北孝感专区对于去冬今春配合农业生产大跃进，曾经作了群众文化宣传运动的规划。这个规划要求全区组织一支五十多万人的文化宣传大军，其中包括专业文化队伍二千一百零八人，业余文化队伍五万八千三百七十五人；要求根据各县、区、乡、社的典型材料，创作宣传演唱材料五千九百四十九件，其中剧本三百二十一个；供应各种宣传资料四十九万份，图画二百七十六幅；举办固定的展览室十七个，流动展览六千四百三十八次；举办大、小戏曲歌舞会演二百九十八次；编壁报五千八百六十块，黑板报二万三千零八十块，布置宣传橱窗二百二十八个。对图书阅览、有线广播、幻灯、讲座也都提出具体的要求。同时要求发展农村俱乐部六百八十一个，发展宣传员六万三千人。这样的规划在全国各省、专、县也都可以仿办。
    我们建议全国一切文化机关、团体和文化工作者，紧紧跟上今年工农业生产的大跃进，面向工厂、面向农村、大量创作为群众所喜爱的促进大跃进的新作品和新电影，大大地加强对工农群众业余文化活动的辅导，大量供应他们各项文娱资料。我们建议一切文化团体和文化工作者，协同现在大批下放的干部，在工厂、农村大大开展群众业余文化活动，并且在群众自愿的原则下，帮助发展群众业余文化组织，首先是俱乐部的组织。大力发展群众自办的文化事业和群众业余文化活动，这就是在一九五八年，在第二个五年计划期内，全国文化工作积极发展的主要方向。专业文化艺术团体应该着重提高质量，多做普及工作和对群众业余文化的辅导工作，同时要根据勤俭办事业的精神，厉行精简节约，反对铺张浪费。一九五八年计划中所列的新建剧场、电影院、剧团、文化馆和放映队等，建议各地方着重把它们安排在少数民族地区、边远地区和新工业区，而且必须是小型的，不要盲目提高规格和单价。
    有人说，文化部门是“清水衙门”，浪费不大。这话不合乎事实。当然，有许多文化艺术团体是能够勤俭办事业，艰苦地进行工作的，例如大批的电影放映队，县以下的书店、剧团、文化馆和文化站。但是，不能否认许多文化艺术团体的铺张浪费是相当严重的。目前文化部正在所属机关团体中展开一个热火朝天的反浪费运动。根据揭发的材料，可以看出不少机构的浪费情形是惊人的。这里只举一个例子，这就是中央实验歌剧院。它是归文化部直接领导的一个团体，它在人力积压、物力浪费方面都很严重。比如在它的六十八个演员中，去年全年演出十次到十五次的有五人，演二十次到三十次的二十三人，演三十次到四十次的三十一人，最多的演出四十二场，只三人；全年没有演出一场的却有六人。它库存的服装有五千件之多，各种灯泡有八百个。他们演“迎春花开”一个戏，先做了二十一套服装，因为不合意，全部否定作废；布景搞一座房子，几乎有三层楼高，最后锯掉一截才搬上舞台。“茶花女”一个戏的演出费用达到二万三千元。要演一个名为“挑女婿”的戏，排好了，布景也作了，后来没有演出，现在连布景也找不到了。这个剧院每演一场戏平均费用三千元，演出收入一千元，国家赔贴二千元。应该说明，在全国文化艺术团体里，像实验歌剧院那样浪费的情况并不是个别的，也还有比它更加严重的。
    文化部门这种严重的浪费现象是怎样造成的呢？首先，是由于许多文化部门的领导人和不少文化工作者有严重的资产阶级挥霍铺张的思想，他们没有认识到勤俭建国乃是我们建设社会主义的根本方针，而挥霍浪费对人民说来是一种不可宽恕的罪过。其次，是由于许多文化艺术团体不是贯彻文化为工农兵服务，文化工作者和工农兵密切结合的方针，而是被资产阶级的文艺思想和资本主义经营思想，牵着鼻子走，脱离群众，形式主义，比阔气、讲排场。最后，许多文化领导机关（首先是中央文化部）的官僚主义作风则是造成浪费的最主要的原因。它们平素对文化艺术团体的财务、基建、编制以至重大方针，没有很好地管理和严格的控制和检查，长期拖拉放任，造成了今天严重浪费的局面。因此，全国文化艺术团体这番必须掀起轰轰烈烈的反浪费运动，经过大鸣大放、大争大辩、大整大改几个阶段，用熊熊烈火，把铺张浪费和那种阔气、官气、暮气彻底烧掉，树立起勤劳、节俭、艰苦、朴素的新风气。只有这样，我们的文化艺术事业才能真正成为工农群众自己的事业，才能更好地为他们服务。在反浪费运动的基础上，我们建议全国文化艺术团体都搞一个增产节约的规划，大力加强经营管理，精简机构，节省开支，努力做到一九五八年的文化经费能够比国家预算所列的节减百分之五至十，即为国家节约一千万元到二千万元的资金；中央文化部的直属单位应该努力做到节减经费百分之十至十五，即六百万元到九百万元。不准资产阶级思想向社会主义进攻，坚决反对坏戏、坏书、坏歌、坏舞最后我还要说一个问题：我们要批判和反对坏戏、坏书和坏歌曲。
    这一年来，一部分资产阶级知识分子、艺人和商人，为了贪图私利，同时企图用资产阶级的反动的世界观来拖新社会的后腿，他们从资产阶级的立场和观点出发，歪曲“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，放肆地演出像“杀子报”、“大劈棺”、“活僵尸”、“黄氏女游阴”一类的坏戏，发行像“末代皇帝传奇”、“奇侠恐怖党”、“甜如蜜”等反动、荒诞、淫秽的坏书，传布像“支那之夜”、“疯狂世界”、“何日君再来”、“夜上海”、“野花朵朵香”等反动、淫荡、下流的所谓“黄色歌曲”，和推行“阿飞舞”一类的坏舞蹈。这样就严重地影响到一部分青年工人、农民、特别是学生，使他们的劳动和学习纪律松弛，思想堕落，生活腐化，甚至走上犯罪和反动的道路。
    我们必须认识，这些坏戏、坏书、坏歌、坏舞的流行，实质上标志着资产阶级在思想领域内向社会主义的猖狂进攻。我们必须提高嗅觉对这些毒害和腐蚀劳动人民的毒草进行严肃的批判。在发现坏戏、坏书、坏歌、坏舞流行的时候，我们就应该及时地在群众中展开辩论，同群众一起进行批判，使大家认识这些毒草，它们对于社会主义建设的严重危害，来提高群众的觉悟，和鉴别力，就是说，提高人民的免疫力，把毒草变成肥料。在这方面，我们希望得到全国人民代表和工会，青年团，妇联以及其他有关方面的密切配合和一致行动。我国著名艺术家梅兰芳先生等曾经在去年七月联名发出“我们不演坏戏”的号召。我们全体文化艺术工作者是为人民服务，为社会主义服务的，应该热烈地响应这个正义的号召，保证自己并且相约不演坏戏，不流传坏书和坏歌曲。这是每一个新中国的文化艺术工作者所应尽的庄严的职责。当然在对毒草进行批判和斗争的同时，我们必须继续坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，决不要因为发现了一些毒草，就动摇我们执行这一方针的决心。
    任何文化园地，如果无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领。这是过渡时期文化建设的一条基本规律。今天坏戏、坏书、坏歌、坏舞之所以还有一定的市场，正也说明我们的社会主义文化艺术工作还有严重的缺点。我们对工农群众和青年的普及工作还做得很差，适合于工农阅读和欣赏的创作还太少。今后我们必须使出十二万分的干劲，大量地创作新的群众歌曲和剧本，编印好的通俗图书，开展社会主义的群众歌咏运动，推广好戏、好书，以堂堂之师，巩固地占领群众文化的阵地。这是我国社会主义文化的基本建设工作。每一个革命文化工作者没有任何理由可以拒绝承担这样一项灭资兴无的庄严义务。我们有根据相信，我们一定能够办到这一点。
