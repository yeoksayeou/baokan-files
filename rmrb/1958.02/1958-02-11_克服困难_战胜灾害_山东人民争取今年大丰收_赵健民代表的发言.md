I fully agree with the reports on the draft state budget and the draft state economic plan made by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and fully agree with the report on the current reform of the Chinese script and the Chinese phonetic alphabet made by Director Wu Yuzhang.

Currently, a magnificent new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production is emerging across the country. In this era of great change, the people of Shandong, like the people of the whole country, are giving full play to their revolutionary drive and engaging in a vigorous socialist construction. However, Shandong Province suffered its worst flood and drought disasters since the founding of the country last year. The people of Shandong are launching an upsurge in agricultural production under the conditions of overcoming severe flood and drought disasters. Now I will report to the congress on how the people of Shandong have boosted their revolutionary drive, overcome all difficulties, conquered the disasters, strived for a bumper harvest in 1958, and strived to basically achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule.

**Shandong, with Support from All Sides, Struggled Hard and Overcame Last Year's Severe Floods and Droughts**

In July last year, our province experienced eight torrential rains in less than twenty days, with a total rainfall of 600 to 800 millimeters, and more than 1,000 millimeters in some areas, exceeding 150 percent of the average annual rainfall. A total of 12,985 breaches occurred in rivers, both large and small, throughout the province. At that time, the southwestern part of our province was a vast expanse of water for hundreds of miles, with a depth of 2 to 3 meters. Motorboats with a draft of 1.7 meters could navigate without hindrance, forming the worst flood disaster in a century. At the same time as the torrential rains, some areas were hit by several hurricanes (referred to by the masses as tornadoes). For example, a hurricane in the southern part of Shan County on the night of July 10th destroyed fourteen villages in just five minutes, collapsed more than 120,000 houses, and caused more than 890 casualties among the masses. A hurricane in Dongguan, Linyi, caused more than 200 casualties. A total of 75 counties and cities in the province suffered from floods. More than 12,000 villages were surrounded by water or flooded, and more than 1,000 villages were completely destroyed by floods and wind. A total of more than 34.9 million mu of land was inundated, resulting in a total reduction of more than 3.3 billion jin of grain. More than 3 million houses collapsed due to floods and wind. A total of 1,499 people were drowned or crushed to death, and 5,824 were injured. A total of 6,686 livestock were drowned or crushed to death, and more than 2,100 were injured. In total, there were 9.2 million disaster victims in the province, of which 7.4 million were severely affected.

Faced with this serious disaster situation, we mobilized all possible forces, and under the leadership and concern of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and with the strong assistance of fraternal regions, we went all out to fight heroically and stubbornly against natural disasters. Party and government organs and organizations in the disaster areas took rescue and disaster relief as the overriding central task. The broad masses of cadres and people worked day and night to repair breaches and rescue and resettle disaster victims. When the disaster situation was at a critical juncture, the Central Military Commission, the General Flood Control Headquarters, and the land, sea, and air forces and fraternal governments of Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Lianyungang, and other places sent a large number of technical personnel and various modern life-saving equipment to carry out rescue efforts. A total of 123 sorties were made by airplanes, 108 amphibious vehicles and trucks, more than 470 rubber boats and motorboats, and more than 20,000 lifebuoys. More than 400,000 jin of cooked food were airdropped. In the rescue and relief efforts, the broad masses of cadres, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and the People's Liberation Army fully developed the noble character of sharing weal and woe with the people. For example, the county party secretary and county magistrate of Chengwu County, during the heavy rains, led more than 40 cadres, took wooden boats, and carried more than 4,000 jin of cooked food, risking danger and braving the rain to deliver food to the disaster victims surrounded by floods. When the disaster victims received the cooked food, some were moved to tears. When the Taipingliu River embankment in Juye County breached, Wang, the district party secretary, and Zhu, the district head, led more than ten cadres to block the breach with their bodies, persevering for a day and a night. Dong Ruiguang, a member of the Communist Youth League in Miaolou Township, Chengwu County, led more than 20 young people, enduring hunger and cold for nine consecutive hours throughout the night, floating more than eight li in the water, and rescued a large number of square timbers and beams worth 27,000 yuan for bridge construction and carried them to the construction site. In order to quickly repair the breaches to ensure the safety of the people's lives and property in the Yanzhou area and the smooth flow of the Jinpu Railway, the officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Yanzhou formed three human dikes with their arms linked together in the chest-deep rapids, persevering in rescue for five hours until the breaches were completely blocked. Countless heroic deeds like this emerged. In Linyi Prefecture alone, there were 30 model units and more than 300 model figures in rescue and disaster relief. During the struggle for rescue and disaster relief, comrades Lei Daxiang, Xie Linzhang, Wang Sangui, officers of the People's Liberation Army, Fu Shaolan, president of the Pingyi County Court, Qian Xingyuan, a people's teacher in Shan County, and Li Xieshan, director of the health clinic, unfortunately sacrificed their precious lives. They will always be mourned by the people of Shandong.

Thanks to the hard work of the Party, government, army, and people throughout the province, the extraordinary flood was finally overcome, and more than 1.5 million disaster victims trapped in deep water were safely rescued. At the same time, it greatly inspired and encouraged the people in the disaster areas to rebuild their homes, restore production, and overcome the disasters. In just over a month after the disaster, more than 1.34 million collapsed houses were repaired, more than 12,000 breaches in rivers large and small were repaired, and more than 5.2 million mu of late autumn crops such as cowpeas, sweet potatoes, and corn were replanted.

The flood disaster had just passed when drought disasters followed. After the beginning of autumn, the province was generally dry. There was little rain and thin clouds for a hundred days. There was only 40 millimeters of rainfall in more than three months, which was 15 percent of the rainfall in the same period in previous years, while the evaporation was 150 percent more than in the same period in previous years. Among them, 31 counties had no rain for 60 days, and others had no rain for 103 days. This formed the worst drought disaster in decades in the province. The remaining crops and replanted late autumn crops after the flood disaster mostly withered. A total of 82 million mu of late autumn crops in the province suffered reduced yields due to drought, of which more than 40 million mu were affected by disaster, resulting in a total reduction of more than 2 billion jin of grain.

When the drought became a disaster, the Party, government, army, and people throughout the province once again mobilized urgently and launched a production campaign centered on fighting drought, planting wheat, and protecting autumn crops. A total of 250,000 cadres from government agencies, officers and soldiers from the troops, enterprise employees, and teachers and students from schools, together with more than 10 million agricultural cooperative members, plunged into the vigorous struggle against drought. All available water sources and water tools were utilized, and old wells were actively repaired, new wells were dug, water sources were excavated, and water tools were added. In many areas, thousands of troops and horses worked during the day, and lights shone everywhere at night, watering and planting wheat day and night, forming an unprecedented mass upsurge against drought. In the fight against drought, the broad masses also displayed their creativity. For example, many rivers, wells, and pits in Dingtao County had already dried up. The masses came up with many new methods such as digging rivers in rivers, digging pits in pits, connecting rivers to pits, and connecting pits to wells to make full use of water sources. The total length of canals dug throughout the county reached 1,964 li. In Heze Prefecture, a severely affected area, 8.35 million mu of wheat were planted against drought, exceeding the wheat planting plan. A total of nearly 30 million mu of wheat was planted against drought by carrying water by hand or shoulder throughout the province, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total wheat sowing area, basically completing the province's wheat sowing plan. The masses reflected that this was a miracle of man conquering nature under the leadership of the Communist Party.

**Vigorously Carry Out Production for Self-Relief, Practice Economy to Overcome Difficulties, and Cooperativization Shows Unparalleled Superiority**

On the basis of overcoming the flood and drought disasters, we immediately launched a production for self-relief movement in the disaster areas. Due to the severe attacks of flood and drought disasters, some cadres and disaster victims in the disaster areas were once ideologically unstable, pessimistic, and afraid of difficulties, lacking the confidence to produce for self-relief and overcome the disasters. Some disaster victims relied solely on government relief, and some disaster victims blindly migrated outward. Therefore, we conducted extensive and in-depth socialist education in the disaster areas, extensively mobilized and helped agricultural cooperatives formulate production for self-relief plans, comprehensively arranged the production and life of cooperative members, and with the strong support and active leadership of the Party and the government, greatly enhanced the confidence of the masses in the disaster areas in production for self-relief and launched a movement of production for self-relief and practicing economy to overcome difficulties. According to incomplete statistics from the disaster areas of Jining, Heze, Linyi, and Tai'an prefectures, 1.41 million disaster victims have launched more than 30 kinds of sideline production. As of December last year, they had already earned 42.22 million yuan. Among them, 35 percent of the 5,552 disaster-stricken cooperatives in Jining Prefecture had achieved self-sufficiency with surplus, 44.7 percent of the disaster-stricken cooperatives were able to produce for self-relief, and other cooperatives were also able to solve some problems. In addition, they also collected more than 400 million jin of dried vegetables and other substitutes for food. Due to the development of education on practicing economy to overcome difficulties, frugality has become a common practice.

While carrying out the production for self-relief movement in the disaster areas, a movement to increase production, practice economy, and support the disaster areas was also launched in non-disaster areas and cities. In rural areas, the broad masses of peasants warmly responded to the call of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee to "strive to produce ten more jin of grain per mu of land and five more jin of ginned cotton per mu of cotton field to make up for the deficiencies and support the disaster areas." They also stored a large amount of dried vegetables to support the disaster areas, raised livestock on behalf of the disaster areas, resettled disaster victims who had been transferred, and helped the disaster areas repair houses. For example, more than 800 agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas in Linyi Prefecture contributed labor and grass to help disaster-stricken cooperatives repair more than 28,000 collapsed houses. Cooperative members in non-disaster areas in Heze County took the initiative to resettle more than 8,000 disaster victims and lent out more than 1,500 houses. A total of more than 134,000 disaster victims were resettled in non-disaster areas throughout the province. In cities, government agencies, troops, factories, mines, enterprises, schools, and urban residents saved one to two liang of food per person per day, saving a total of more than 100 million jin of grain. They also actively donated to disaster relief, donating a total of more than 2.4 million yuan in cash and more than 640,000 pieces of clothing.

Under the instructions and concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, fraternal regions and the People's Liberation Army also strongly supported the production for self-relief movement in the disaster areas. The State Council has approved that our province will sell more grain than it purchases by more than 1 billion jin in 1957, and has allocated an additional 57 million yuan to our province for relief funds and bank loans. The Hebei Province sent a comfort group and donated 200,000 yuan in cash. Beijing and Shanghai donated 450,000 yuan in cash and more than 68,000 pieces of winter clothing. In addition, 77 delegates to the National People's Congress saved food and clothing and donated money to relieve the disaster victims in our province. All of this has greatly encouraged our determination and confidence in overcoming the disaster and has played a significant role in ensuring the victory over the disaster. Here, on behalf of the people of Shandong Province, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Party Central Committee, the State Council, fraternal regions, the People's Liberation Army, and the delegates to the National People's Congress.

Through the disaster relief work, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened. The broad masses clearly understand that the Party and the People's Government share the same destiny and breathe the same air with them. In particular, when recalling the tragic situation caused by the disaster during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they have increased their love for the Communist Party and the People's Government. Many disaster victims reflected, "The Kuomintang airplanes dropped bombs, and the Communist Party airplanes delivered life-saving food. The old people have never seen steamed buns falling from the sky." "In the old society, when disasters occurred, wives and children were separated, and families were destroyed. Now there is food, shelter, and clothing, and every family is reunited." "I have never seen such a big disaster, and I have never seen such a good government. The kindness of the Communist Party will never be forgotten." They concluded from their personal experience: "Melons cannot be separated from vines, children cannot be separated from their mothers, and the working people cannot be separated from the Communist Party."

It should be admitted that the unparalleled superiority of cooperativization and the great power of organized forces have been fully demonstrated in the struggle against the flood and drought disasters. Without the collective strength of the people organized by the cooperative, it would not have been possible to achieve such great disaster relief results, it would not have been possible to quickly restore production, and the losses to people's lives and property would have been unimaginable. In the extremely tense situation of the flood, each cooperative and team threw themselves into the battle with organization, planning, and division of labor. The front line was engaged in flood prevention and rescue, and the rear was engaged in resettling the old and weak and transferring property and grain. The cooperative made unified arrangements to solve the problems of disaster victims who had no clothes, no food, no housing, or were injured or killed. In the struggle against drought, the cooperative mobilized and organized all members, men, women, old, and young, to do their best, utilize all available tools and water sources, and water and plant wheat and restore production day and night. The serious test of the two major disasters on the cooperative, after the two struggles, the cooperative was not weakened, but more consolidated, and further strengthened the will of the masses to take the road of cooperativization and greatly improved the prestige of the cooperative. In Chengwu County, a heavily affected area, more than 3,000 individual farmers actively requested to join the cooperative after overcoming the flood and drought disasters. Disaster victims generally reflected: "Cooperatives can both resist floods and resist droughts. Nothing can be done without cooperatives."

Up to now, although our province has made great achievements in disaster relief work, there are still many difficulties and problems in front of us. First of all, under the impact of the extraordinary flood that occurs once in a century, millions of severely affected disaster victims have lost all their savings accumulated over the years. Secondly, the collapse of houses in the flood-stricken areas is serious. Although the disaster victims have been initially resettled, some houses have been built simply, and some have not collapsed, but they are still in danger of collapsing due to flood damage. There is an extreme shortage of grass and feed in the disaster areas, and the phenomenon of livestock diseases, slaughter, and sales is still relatively serious in some areas. Diseases caused by disasters may spread and become popular this spring. In addition, the leadership of disaster relief work in some areas still has the phenomenon of being not thorough, not detailed, and not specific. There are still some disaster victims blindly migrating outward in some areas. Therefore, it is still a very arduous task to completely overcome the serious disaster before the wheat harvest, ensure that no disaster victim is hungry or flees the famine, that no mu of land is left uncultivated, and that no livestock dies. We must not be complacent or slack in the slightest, and we must conscientiously implement the disaster relief policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, give full play to favorable conditions, overcome difficulties, and continue to lead the people of the province to work hard with heroic and tenacious spirit to completely overcome the disaster.

**The Masses Urgently Demand to Eradicate Natural Disasters and Launch a Movement to March Towards Agriculture**

Delegates! Although the flood and drought disasters in 1957 brought deep disasters to the people of Shandong and caused a great loss of wealth, they could not scare the people of Shandong under the leadership of the Communist Party. On the contrary, they educated the people and strengthened the people's confidence. Fighting against natural disasters, fundamentally changing the natural appearance, greatly reducing the harm of natural disasters, and forever eradicating the harm of natural disasters have become the urgent demands of the people of the whole province. As early as after the autumn drought and wheat planting last autumn, Shandong immediately launched a turbulent wave of conquering nature and marching towards agriculture last winter. At present, the upsurge of agricultural production in the province is developing in a comprehensive, in-depth, and lasting way. According to recent statistics, about 18 million men and women, full and semi-laborers, have invested in farmland capital construction, pig raising, fertilizer accumulation, wheat field management, and diversified economic production. In just over two months, mass farmland water conservancy construction has approached or greatly exceeded the original planned level. In total, 400,000,285 new wells have been dug throughout the province, more than 330,000 old wells have been repaired, 17,729 ponds and reservoirs have been built, 9,000 are under construction, 4.61 million mu of ditches, ridge fields, enclosed fields, and terrace fields have been built, 5.58 million mu of large ridge fields have been built, 13,231 canals have been built, and more than 90,000 grain dams have been built. The completed projects can expand the irrigated area by 13.33 million mu, improve the irrigated area by 1.23 million mu, drain the waterlogged area by 6.27 million mu, and control the soil erosion area by 2,076 square kilometers. Pig raising and fertilizer accumulation have progressed rapidly. The number of live pigs raised has reached 8.48 million, an increase of 20.1 percent compared with before winter. A total of 337.8 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, and 17.3 million mu of soil has been deeply ploughed, deeply cultivated, and improved. In short, the scale of the movement, the breadth of the content, and the speed of the progress are all unprecedented. In the first five-year plan, the agricultural harvest of the province was two bumper years (1954, 1956), one average year (1955), and two disaster years (1953, 1957). We believe that after several years of full-scale mass small-scale farmland water conservancy construction, coupled with the large-scale projects of comprehensive national governance, gradually taking effect and being completed, we are confident that we can deal with water and drought disasters like in 1953 and ensure that they will not become disasters, and that serious disasters like last year can also greatly reduce their harm.

On this basis, we have proposed to the people of the province on the 23rd of last month that in terms of farmland capital construction this year, the expansion of the irrigated area will be increased from the original planned 10 million mu to 20 million mu, and strive to reach 30 million mu. (We estimate that after the upsurge of water conservancy this winter and next spring, the water conservancy of the province can be basically realized before 1960.) It is required that the planned 10 million mu of large ridge fields be changed to 30 million mu. The planned area for expanding the transformation of waterlogged depressions is changed from the originally planned 3 million mu to 5 million mu, so that 15 million mu of waterlogged depressions will be protected from drought and flood. Expanding the work of soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, it is required that the area of soil and water loss control be increased from the originally planned 6,000 square kilometers to 20,000 square kilometers. In terms of pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, the planned 10 million heads will be increased to 15 million heads, and strive to reach 20 million heads. In terms of agricultural production, the total grain output will be guaranteed to reach 32 billion jin, and strive to reach 35 billion jin. The total cotton output will be guaranteed to reach 4.8 million dan, and strive to reach 5.35 million dan. We will cultivate 1,000 cooperatives with a yield of 1,000 jin, and strive to have a 500-jin prefecture and a 1,000-jin county this year to drive the great leap forward in production throughout the province. In addition, we also call on the people of the province to make up their minds, make all preparations, make persistent efforts, and strive to basically realize the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) ahead of schedule during the second five-year plan, and strive to make the province's grain output double the highest annual output in 1956, reaching 60 billion jin, so that the average possession of the people of the province reaches 1,000 jin.

Delegates! Under the correct leadership and support of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, we have overcome the serious flood and drought disasters last year, and are now giving full play to the revolutionary drive to completely transform nature, conquer nature, and strive to basically realize the struggle to achieve the targets of the Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and firmly developing the wisdom and revolutionary spirit of the broad masses, we will be able to gradually build Shandong Province into a new Shandong with sufficient food and clothing with the momentum of riding the wind and waves! And together with the people of the whole country, we will quickly build the motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    克服困难　战胜灾害
    山东人民争取今年大丰收
    赵健民代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波副总理所作的关于国家预算草案和国家经济计划草案的报告，完全同意彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告，完全同意吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革和汉语拼音方案的报告。
    目前，在全国范围内，出现了一个波澜壮阔的工农业生产的新高潮。在这个伟大变革的时代里，山东人民也像全国人民一样，鼓足了革命的干劲，进行着热火朝天的社会主义建设。但是，山东地区在去年遭受了建国以来最大的一次水旱灾害，山东人民是在战胜了严重的水旱灾害的条件下掀起农业生产高潮的。现在我把山东人民如何鼓起革命干劲，克服一切困难，战胜灾荒，争取一九五八年大丰收并争取提前五年基本上实现全国农业发展纲要指标的情况，向大会作以下的汇报。
    山东在各方面支持下艰苦奋斗  战胜了去年严重的水灾和旱灾
    去年七月，我省在不足二十天的时间里，连降八次暴雨，综合雨量达六百至八百公厘，有些地区达一千公厘以上，超过全年平均雨量的百分之一百五十，全省大小河道决口达一万二千九百八十五处，当时我省西南部地区方圆数百里形成一片汪洋，水深二至三公尺，吃水一公尺七的机轮畅行无阻，形成百年来未有的大水灾。在暴雨的同时，部分地区夹有数次飓风（群众称龙卷风），如单县南部七月十日夜一次飓风，仅五分钟的时间毁坏了十四个村庄，刮倒房屋十二万余间，群众死伤八百九十余人。临沂东关一次飓风死伤二百余人。全省共有七十五个县、市遭受水灾，被水包围和进水的村庄有一万二千多个，被水灾风灾完全冲毁的村庄有一千多个；淹没土地共三千四百九十余万亩，共计减产粮食三十三亿余斤；因水灾、风灾而倒塌的房屋三百余万间；淹死、砸死群众一千四百九十九人，伤五千八百二十四人；淹死、砸死牲畜六千六百八十六头，伤二千一百多头。总计全省灾民共有九百二十万人，其中重灾民七百四十万人。
    面对这一严重灾情，我们调动了一切可能调动的力量，在党中央国务院的领导关怀及兄弟地区的大力援助下，全力以赴，同自然灾害进行了英勇顽强的斗争。灾区党政机关团体则以抢险救灾为压倒一切的中心任务，广大干部、群众不分昼夜，抢险堵口，抢救安置灾民。当灾情处于紧急关头之际，中央军委、防汛总指挥部、及上海、天津、南京、徐州、广州、沈阳、连云港等地陆海空军和上述地区兄弟政府，派来了大批技术人力和各种现代化的救生器材，奋勇抢救。前后共出动飞机一百二十三架次，水陆两用汽车、卡车一百零八辆，橡皮舟、机轮等四百七十余只，救生圈两万余个，空投熟食四十余万斤。在抢险救灾中，广大干部、党团员、人民解放军充分发扬了与人民同甘苦共患难的高贵品德。例如，城武县县委书记和县长，在大雨成灾期间，带领四十多名干部，乘坐木船，携带熟食四千余斤，涉险冒雨给被洪水围困的灾民送饭，灾民得到熟食，有的感激流泪。当巨野县太平流河堤决口时，该区区委王书记和朱区长，带领十余名干部以身堵口，坚持一天一夜。城武县苗楼乡共青团员董瑞光带领二十多名青年，在澈夜连续九小时，忍饥耐寒，浮水八里路以外，把价值二万七千元架桥用的大批方木大梁抢救回来抬到工地。为了迅速抢险堵口以确保兗州地区人民生命财产的安全和津浦铁路的畅通，驻兗州部队的官兵，他们在水深齐胸的激流里挽臂组成三道人堤，坚持抢救了五小时，直到决口全部堵好才出水上岸。像这样见义勇为、舍身救人的英雄事迹是不胜枚举的，仅临沂专区即出现了三十个模范单位和三百多名抢险救灾的模范人物。在抢险救灾的斗争中，解放军军官雷大祥、谢林章、王三贵、平邑县法院院长傅绍兰、单县人民教师钱行远、卫生所所长李协山等同志不幸献出了自己的宝贵生命，他们将永远为山东人民所悼念。
    由于全省党、政、军、民的艰苦奋斗，终于战胜了这场特大洪水，使被深水围困的一百五十余万灾民安然脱险。同时，也大大振奋和鼓舞了灾区人民重建家园、恢复生产、战胜灾荒的决心和信心。仅在灾后一个多月的时间里，修复倒房一百三十四万余间，抢堵大小河流决口一万二千余处，抢种菜豆、地瓜、玉米等晚秋作物五百二十余万亩。
    水灾刚过，旱灾接踵而来。入秋以后，全省普遍干旱，百日之内云薄雨微，三个多月仅降雨四十公厘，为历年同期降雨量的百分之十五，而蒸发量却比历年同期多百分之一百五十，其中有三十一个县少者六十天无雨，多者一百零三天无雨。形成全省数十年未有的大旱灾。水灾之后残存的庄稼及补种的晚秋作物大都干死。全省有八千二百万亩晚秋作物因旱减产，其中四千多万亩成灾，共约减产粮食二十亿余斤。
    当干旱成灾时，全省党、政、军、民再一次地紧急动员起来，投入了以抗旱种麦保秋为中心的生产运动。全省有二十五万机关干部、部队官兵、企业职工和学校师生员工，协同千余万农业社员投入了热火朝天的抗旱斗争。凡是能利用的一切水源水具都利用起来，并积极修复旧井，增打新井，挖掘水源，增添水具。许多地区白天千军万马，夜间灯火遍野，夜以继日地浇水种麦，形成了前所未有的群众性的抗旱高潮。在抗旱斗争中，广大群众还发挥了创造精神。例如，定陶县的许多河、井、坑已经浇干，群众又想出了河里挖河、坑里挖坑、河连坑、坑连井等许多新方法，充分利用了水源，全县挖引河渠长达一千九百六十四华里。在重灾区的菏泽专区，抗旱种麦八百三十五万亩，超额完成了种麦计划。全省共计手提肩挑浇水抗旱种麦近三千万亩，占全部小麦播种面积的百分之五十以上，基本上完成了省的小麦播种计划。群众反映这是共产党领导人民出现的人定胜天的奇迹。
    大力进行生产自救节约渡荒  合作化显示了无比的优越性
    在战胜水、旱灾害的基础上，我们在灾区紧接着开展了生产自救运动。由于水、旱灾害的严重袭击，灾区的部分干部和灾民曾一度思想动荡不安，消极畏难，缺乏生产自救、战胜灾荒的信心，有些灾民单纯依靠政府救济，并有部分灾民盲目外流。因此，我们在灾区广泛深入地进行了社会主义教育，广泛发动并帮助农业社制定生产自救计划，全面安排社员的生产、生活，加以党和政府的大力扶持，积极领导，大大提高了灾区群众生产自救的信心，掀起了生产自救、节约渡荒的运动。据济宁、菏泽、临沂、泰安四个专区的灾区不完全统计，有一百四十一万灾民开展了三十多种副业生产，截至去年十二月份业已收入四千二百二十万元，其中济宁专区五千五百五十二处灾社，有百分之三十五的受灾社达到自给有余，有百分之四十四点七的受灾社能够生产自救，其它社也能解决部分问题。另外还采集干菜和其他代食品四亿余斤；由于节约渡荒教育的开展，省吃俭用已形成风气。
    和灾区开展生产自救运动的同时，在非灾区和城市也开展了增产节约支援灾区的运动。在农村，广大农民热烈响应了中共山东省委、省人民委员会提出的“争取每亩地多打十斤粮、每亩棉田多产五斤籽棉，以丰补歉，支援灾区”的号召；并大量储备干菜支援灾区，为灾区代养牲畜，安置转移来的灾民，帮助灾区修建房屋等。如临沂专区有八百余处非灾区农业社，出工献草，帮助受灾社修复倒房二万八千余间。菏泽县非灾区社员主动安置了八千多灾民，借出房子一千五百余间。全省共在非灾区安置灾民十三万四千余人。在城市，机关、部队、厂矿、企业、学校和城市居民中，每人每日节约一至二两口粮，共节约粮食一亿斤以上；并踊跃捐献救灾，共捐现金二百四十余万元，衣物六十四万余件。
    在中央国务院的指示和关怀下，兄弟地区和人民解放军，也有力支持了灾区的生产自救运动。国务院已批准我省一九五七年度粮食销多于购十亿多斤，另增拨给我省救济款和银行贷款五千七百余万元；河北省派来慰问团，捐助现金二十万元；北京和上海市捐助现金四十五万元，寒衣六万八千余件；另外有七十七位全国人民代表大会代表，节衣缩食，捐款救济我省灾胞。所有这一切，都大大鼓舞了我们战胜灾荒的决心和信心，对保证战胜灾荒起了重大的作用。在这里，我谨代表山东全省人民，向党中央、国务院、向兄弟地区、向人民解放军和全国人民代表大会代表，表示衷心的感谢。
    通过救灾工作，进一步地密切了党与群众的关系，广大群众都清楚的了解，党和人民政府同他们是同命运共呼吸的，特别是回忆到国民党反动统治时期，灾荒所造成的惨境时，更增加了对共产党和人民政府的热爱，许多灾民反映说：“国民党的飞机扔炸弹，共产党的飞机送救命粮，老辈子没见过天上掉馍馍”。“旧社会遇到灾害，妻离子散，家破人亡；现在是有吃有住又有穿，家家团圆”。“从来没有见过这样的大灾荒，从来没有见过这样的好政府，共产党的恩情永世不能忘”。他们从切身的体验中得出结论说：“瓜离不开秧，孩儿离不开娘，劳动人民离不开共产党”。
    应该承认，在这次抗击水旱灾害的斗争中，充分显示了合作化的无比优越性，表现了组织起来的巨大力量。如果没有合作社组织起来的人民集体力量的发挥，那么，取得如此巨大的抗灾成绩是不可能的，迅速恢复生产是不可能的，人民生命财产损失之大将是不可想像的。在水灾万分紧张的情况下，各个社、队都有组织有计划有分工地投入战斗，前方防汛抢险，后方安置老弱，转移财物、粮食；对无衣无食无房和死伤的灾民，合作社统一安排解决，在抗旱斗争中，合作社发动组织了男女老少所有社员，各尽其能，利用一切可以利用的工具和水源，日夜不停地浇水种小麦，恢复生产。两次大灾对合作社的严重考验，经过两次斗争，合作社不是削弱了，而是更加巩固了，更加坚定了群众走合作化道路的意志，大大提高了合作社的威信。重灾区城武县在战胜水旱灾害之后，有三千多单干农民积极要求入社，灾民普遍反映：“合作社既能抗涝，又能抗旱，没有合作社啥也办不到”。
    到目前为止，我省救灾工作虽然取得巨大成绩，但在我们面前还是有很多困难和问题的。首先，在百年一遇的特大洪水冲击下，数百万特重灾民，多年积蓄损失一空。其次，水灾地区房屋倒塌严重，灾民虽已初步安置，但有些房屋修建简陋，有的虽未倒塌亦因受洪水伤害，仍有倒塌危险；灾区烧草、饲料极端缺乏，牲畜病疫、宰杀、出卖现象有的地区还较严重；因灾发生的疾病，今春可能蔓延流行。此外，有的地区对救灾工作的领导，还存在有不深入不细致不具体的现象，有的地区还有部分灾民盲目外流。因此，要彻底战胜麦收前的严重灾荒，保证不使一个灾民挨饿逃荒，不使一亩土地荒芜，不使一口牲畜死亡，还是一项十分艰巨的任务。我们丝毫不能自满、松懈，必须兢兢业业，切实贯彻中共中央国务院的救灾方针，充分发挥有利条件，克服困难，继续以英勇顽强的精神，领导全省人民艰苦努力，彻底战胜灾荒。
    群众迫切要求根绝自然灾害  掀起了向农业大进军的运动
    各位代表！一九五七年的水旱灾害虽然给山东人民带来深重的灾害，造成了大量财富的损失，但它吓不倒共产党领导下的山东人民，相反的教育了人民，坚定了人民的信心。向自然灾害作斗争，从根本上改变自然面貌，大大削减自然灾害的危害，永远根绝自然灾害的危害，已成为全省人民的迫切要求。山东各地早在去秋抗旱种麦之后，紧接着于去冬掀起了征服自然向农业大进军的汹涛巨浪，目前全省规模的农业生产高潮，正在向全面深入持久的发展着，根据最近统计：约有一千八百余万男女整、半劳力投入了农田基本建设，养猪积肥、麦田管理和副业多种经济等生产运动。在两个多月的时间内，群众性的农田水利建设都接近或大大超过原定计划的水平。总计全省已打新井四十万零二千七百八十五眼，修旧井三十三万多眼，修建塘坝、水库一万七千七百二十九个，正在修建的九千个，沟洫畦田、圩田、台田四百六十一万亩，大地畦田五百五十八万亩，渠道一万三千二百三十一条，谷坊九万多座。已经完成的工程可以扩大溉灌面积一千三百三十三万亩，改善灌溉面积一百二十三万亩，除涝面积六百二十七万亩，控制水土流失面积二千零七十六平方公里。养猪积肥进展较快，生猪存养量达到了八百四十八万头，比冬前增加了百分之二十点一。积肥三千三百七十八亿斤，深翻深刨改良土壤一千七百三十万亩。总之，运动规模之大、内容之广、进展之速都是空前的。在第一个五年计划中，全省农业收成是两个丰年（一九五四年，一九五六年），一个平年（一九五五年），两个灾年（一九五三年，一九五七年）。我们认为：经过今后几年全力开展群众性的小型农田水利建设，再加上国家综合治理的大型工程，逐步生效竣工之后，我们有把握对付像一九五三年那样的水旱灾可以保证不致成灾，像去年那样的严重灾害也可以大大减轻其危害程度的。
    在这个基础上，我们已于上月二十三日向全省人民提出今年在农田基本建设方面，扩大灌溉面积由原定一千万亩增加到二千万亩，争取达到三千万亩。（我们预计：经过今冬明春的水利化高潮，在一九六○年以前就可以基本上实现全省的水利化。）要求大地畦田由原定计划一千万亩改为三千万亩。扩大涝洼改造面积计划由原定的三百万亩改为五百万亩，达到一千五百万亩地的涝洼地旱涝保收。扩大山区水土保持工作，要求控制水土流失面积由原定的六千平方公里，增加到二万平方公里。在养猪积肥方面，由原定计划的一千万头，增加到一千五百万头，争取达到二千万头。在农业生产方面，粮食总产量保证达到三百二十亿斤，争取达到三百五十亿斤。棉花总产量保证达到四百八十万担，争取达到五百三十五万担。我们要培养出一千个千斤社，并尽可能争取在今年出现一个五百斤专区，一个千斤县，以带动全省各地生产大跃进。此外，还号召全省人民下定决心，进行一切准备，再接再厉，争取在第二个五年计划期间，基本上提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的指标要求，争取使全省的粮食产量比最高年产量的一九五六年翻一翻，达到六百亿斤，使全省人民的平均占有量达到一千斤。
    各位代表！在中共中央和国务院的正确领导和支持下，我们已经战胜了去年的严重水旱灾害，目前正鼓足革命的干劲彻底改造自然、征服自然，争取提前五年基本上实现农业发展纲要指标的斗争。我们坚信：在党中央和国务院的正确领导下，坚定地发扬广大群众的智慧和革命精神，我们就能够以乘风破浪之势，逐步把山东省建成为丰衣足食的新山东！并和全国人民一道，迅速地把祖国建设成为一个繁荣富强，具有现代工业，现代农业，现代科学文化的社会主义国家。
