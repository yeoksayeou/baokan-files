    Changes of "Spring" in the Countryside (Clapper Talk)
    Zhao Shuli
    Since I was a child, I've always said spring is good,
    Who knew my dad would find it a source of dread?
    He said, "You kids, you just don't understand:
    Every year when spring comes, things go unplanned.
    If the autumn harvest is good, the grain we get's not low,
    But sadly, we owe debts that people want to know,
    Enough to eat or not, we always have to sell,
    Sell it at a loss, and in spring, we're in grain's hell."
    Old Uncle from the east courtyard gives a bitter laugh,
    He says, "For poor folks, spring's a path of wrath.
    The rich folks, they have a different game:
    They hoard grain in the fall, sell it in spring, what a shame!
    Take a string of cash, earn two or three in trade.
    When spring comes for them, how can they not parade?
    What do we have to join their joyful sound?"
    These old folks, they never knew a world renowned,
    Clearly good spring scenery, yet they can't help but frown.
    Later in the countryside, a new look did abound:
    Land reform divided fields, landlords lost their ground;
    Grain was purchased by the state, private merchants nowhere found;
    Advanced cooperatives, production leaped and crowned;
    Grain distribution had standards, no one could be drowned,
    Surplus grain sold collectively, for people's money renowned,
    More work, more gain; no work, no grain to be found.
    This new life, with a brand-new savor,
    Everyone in winter looks forward to spring's behavior.
    Some speculators, just wanting a quick knack,
    Unable to get rich, they say the commune's wack.
    Same grain distribution, they say they're still on the rack.
    Waste money when they have it, ask the commune when they lack.
    They argue when they want, make trouble when they attack,
    Always trying to break things up, looking for the devil's track.
    Some middle and poor peasants, don't know this act,
    Copying others' ways, shouting the same tact,
    Falling for their schemes, making folks laugh at the fact.
    If we leave the commune, our lives will fall back;
    If there's no unified purchase, grain prices will go off track,
    Spring grain prices rise, autumn grain prices fall, smack!
    Falling into their hoards, rising when they sell, crack!
    We have no money to buy, they want to sell the land back.
    Those bitter springs, we've lived through no small stack,
    Our elders, they already taught us that fact.
    This year's spring, things leap and bound great——
    Production must rise, thought must elevate.
    We middle and poor peasants, no more backward state!
    Recognize right and wrong, only walk the sunny gate.
    Those speculators, let them reveal their fate.
    Find out their motives, help them to appreciate.
    Thought must be rectified, production must elevate,
    Rectification and production, a good union to create.
    Every village builds ponds, every commune digs a canal's estate,
    Opening mountains, blasting rocks, everywhere a great cannonade.
    Working has no men and women, doing has no young and old, elate,
    This good spring, we're living it up, celebrate!
    The elders of the past, sadly passed away early, too late,
    This good spring of ours, they didn't get to await.

    “春”在农村的变化（快板）
    赵树理
    从小过春天，只说春天好，
    谁知我的爹，因此添烦恼？
    他说“孩子家，你们不知道：
    年年到春天，情况都不妙。
    遇着好秋景，打粮也不少，
    可惜欠下债，人家要催讨，
    够吃不够吃，粮食总得粜，
    粜得冒了头，春天吃不饱。”
    东院老大伯，一旁发苦笑，
    他说“穷人家，就怕春来到。
    人家有钱人，另外是一套：
    秋天囤下粮，春天往外粜，
    拿上一吊钱，赚你两三吊。
    人家到春天，怎能不欢笑？
    咱们凭什么，跟着凑热闹？”
    这些老人家，未遇好世道，
    明明好春景，偏得把泪掉。
    后来农村里，换成新面貌：
    土改分了田，地主权失掉；
    粮食行统购，私商捞不到；
    高级合作化，产量往上冒；
    分粮有标准，谁也少不了，
    余粮集体卖，换成人民票，
    多劳便多得，不劳不得要。
    这种新生活，满有新味道，
    人人到冬天，都盼春来到。
    有些投机客，光想取点巧，
    不得发洋财，就说社不好。
    一样分粮食，他说吃不饱。
    有钱浪费掉，没钱向社要。
    想吵他就吵，想闹他就闹，
    总想闹散伙，去找鬼门道。
    有些中贫农，不识这一套，
    学着人家走，跟着人家叫，
    中了人家计，惹得人家笑。
    咱们离了社，生活没有靠；
    再要不统购，粮价上下跳，
    春天粮食涨，秋天粮食落，
    落了人家囤，涨了人家粜，
    咱们没钱买，卖地人家要。
    那些苦春天，过得不算少，
    咱的上辈人，早已领过教。
    今年过春天，事事大飞跃——
    生产要提高，思想要改造。
    咱们中贫农，休戴落后帽！
    认清大是非，只走阳关道。
    那些投机客，让他亮亮宝。
    摸着他的底，帮他开开窍。
    思想也要整，生产也要搞，
    整风与生产，两下结合好。
    村村修水塘，社社开渠道，
    开山崩石头，到处响大炮。
    上工没男女，做活没老少，
    把个好春天，过得很热闹。
    前辈老人们，可惜去世早，
    咱这好春天，他们未等到。
        一九五八年二月十六日
