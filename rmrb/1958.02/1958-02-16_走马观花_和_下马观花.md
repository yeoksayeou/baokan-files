"Skimming the Surface" and "In-Depth Investigation"
	Zeng Zhi

Leading cadres going deep into the grassroots and deep into reality can adopt two methods: one is "skimming the surface," and the other is "in-depth investigation."

The so-called "skimming the surface" means that leading cadres use a relatively short period of time to go deep into reality to make a "surface" observation, to have a rough understanding of a place or several places, a task or several tasks, and to roughly understand the nature of the problem.

Although "skimming the surface" is not a very good method, it is still better to "go" and "observe" than not "go" and not "observe." Because even if you "go" very fast and "observe" not carefully and deeply enough, the more you "go" and the more you "observe," the more phenomena you will see. By concentrating, analyzing, and studying these phenomena, the essence of things will be revealed, and the nature of the problem will become clear.

"In-depth investigation" is certainly better than "skimming the surface." "Dismounting" will not be as hasty as "riding," allowing for more detailed and in-depth investigations and research. It allows for a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the entire progress and process of the work, and can more profoundly discover and solve problems in a timely manner.

It would certainly be good if leading comrades could frequently "dismount for in-depth investigation." If, due to busy work, it is impossible to frequently "dismount" and they can only "skim the surface" sometimes, it is also not unacceptable. But whether it is "riding" or "dismounting," the key is whether you actually "observe" the "flowers." As long as you truly "observe" the "flowers," even if it is a "riding" type of "observation," it will be beneficial to the work. If you only "ride" without "observing" the "flowers," even if you run around below every day, from south to north, from east to west, even if you travel all over China, it will still be of no avail and will only waste a lot of the state's travel expenses.

The purpose of "observing flowers" is to "evaluate flowers," that is, to see which "flowers" are good and which "flowers" are not good, where they are good, and where they are bad. In this way, good "flowers" can be made to bloom more, and bad "flowers" will no longer bloom. There are also two methods for "evaluating flowers": one is to offer your own opinions on one "flower," and the other is to comment on many "flowers." Both of these methods are needed. If you don't comment on one "flower," you won't be able to offer your own opinions on many "flowers."

However, "skimming the surface" or "in-depth investigation" up to "evaluating flowers" has not been achieved by all leading cadres. Some leading cadres often go to the grassroots, but they only "ride" or "dismount" without "observing the flowers." If they don't "observe the flowers," of course, they cannot "evaluate the flowers." Zhang Wen, deputy director of the Safety Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, is such a leader. In the fourth quarter of 1957, Zhang Wen stayed at the Fengfeng Coal Mine for more than ten days. One could say he "dismounted," but he did not "observe" the "flowers." Instead, he stayed in the guest house to sleep and play poker. Because Zhang Wen's interest in playing poker was too strong, the responsible comrades of the Mining Bureau who went to the guest house to talk to him about work had no choice but to retreat.

Although leading cadres like Zhang Wen, who do not "observe the flowers" regardless of whether they "ride" or "dismount," are individual cases, their impact is very bad. No wonder some comrades angrily criticize such leaders as "sightseeing tourists" during the rectification campaign.

May our leading cadres take Zhang Wen as a warning. Whether "riding" or "dismounting," do not be "sightseeing tourists," but be "experts" in "observing flowers" and "evaluating flowers." In this way, our work can continuously leap forward, and all subjectivism and bureaucratism can be eliminated.

    “走马观花”和“下马观花”
    曾志
    领导干部深入基层、深入实际，可以采取两种方法，一种是“走马观花”，一种是“下马观花”。
    所谓“走马观花”，就是说领导干部利用较短的时间深入实际中去作“面”的观察，对一个地方或几个地方、一件工作或几件工作，作轮廓的了解，大体上弄清问题的性质。
    “走马观花”虽然不是一个很好的方法，可是，“走”了“观”了总比不“走”不“观”好。因为即使“走”得很快，“观”得也不够仔细和深入，但“走”得多了“观”得多了，收入眼底的现象就多。集中、分析、研究了这些现象，事物的本质就会显露出来，问题的性质就会明朗化起来。
    “下马观花”当然比“走马观花”好，“下马”就不会像“走马”那样仓促，可以作一些比较细致、深入的调查研究，可以比较全面、系统地了解整个工作进展的情况和过程，可以比较深刻地发现和及时解决一些问题。
    领导同志如果能够经常“下马观花”当然很好，如果由于工作繁忙，不可能经常“下马”有时只能“走马”观花，也未尝不可。但不论是“走马”还是“下马”，关键都在于“观”不“观”花。只要真正“观”了花，即使是“走马”式的“观”法，对工作也有好处。如果只“走马”而不“观”花，即使天天在下面跑，从南到北，从东到西，整个中国都跑遍了，还是于事无补，而且白白浪费了国家很多旅费。
    “观花”的目的是在于“评花”，就是说要看看哪些“花”好，哪些“花”不好，好在哪里，坏在哪里，这样，就可以使好“花”多开放，坏“花”不再开。“评花”也有两种方法，一种是对一枝“花”提出自己的意见来，一种是对许多枝“花”加以评论。这两种方法都需要，不对一枝“花”进行评论，对许多枝“花”也就会提不出自己的意见来。
    但是，“走马观花”或者“下马观花”直至“评花”，并不是所有的领导干部都已经做到了的。有些领导干部虽然经常到基层中去，但却是只“走马”“下马”而不“观花”。不“观花”当然不能“评花”。煤炭工业部安全监察局副局长张文，就是这样的领导人。1957年第四季度，张文曾在峰峰煤矿停留了十多天，要说“下马”也算得是“下马”了，但却不“观”花，而是住在招待所睡觉、打扑克。因为张文打扑克的兴味太浓，到招待所去找他谈工作的矿务局负责同志，只好望而却步。
    像张文这样不管是“走马”还是“下马”都不“观花”的领导干部，虽然是个别的，但影响却非常坏，难怪有些同志在整风中要气愤地批评这样的领导人是“参观旅行家”。
    但愿我们的领导干部，都能以张文为戒。不论是“走马”或是“下马”，都不要做“参观旅行家”，而要做一个“观花”，“评花”的“专家”。这样，我们的工作就能不断地跃进，一切主观主义、官僚主义就能肃清。
