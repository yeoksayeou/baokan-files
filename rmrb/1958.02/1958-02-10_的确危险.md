　　Indeed Dangerous
    Western newspapers have recently been constantly exposing the US authorities' efforts to obstruct the holding of top-level meetings and the adoption of all measures conducive to easing international tensions. According to a report in the "New York Times" on the 7th, the US State Department has instructed US embassies in Western European countries to prevent these countries from accepting the Polish Foreign Minister's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. In its instructions, the US State Department described the Polish proposal as an "extremely dangerous" plan.
    Anyone with a normal brain understands that establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is a good way to prevent the danger of war. How can the US authorities describe it as an "extremely dangerous" plan? It turns out that the US State Department told its subordinates that if the Polish plan were accepted, the US would need to change its strategic policy based on the establishment of forward bases. To put it more clearly, if a nuclear-weapon-free zone were established in Central Europe, the US would not be able to build nuclear war bases there. For the US war plan, isn't the Polish proposal "extremely dangerous"?
    However, the danger to the US war plan is precisely where the security of the people of the world lies. As pressure from public opinion in Western European countries demanding acceptance of the Polish proposal is increasing day by day, it will probably not be so easy for US envoys in Western Europe to carry out the instructions of their superiors.

　　的确危险
    西方报刊最近不断揭露美国当局竭力阻挠举行最高级会议和采取一切有利于缓和国际紧张局势的步骤。据“纽约时报”7日报道，美国国务院已经指令美国驻西欧各国的大使馆，叫它们阻止西欧国家接受波兰外长关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议。美国国务院在指令中，把波兰的建议说成是一个“极端危险”的计划。
    只要是脑筋正常的人都明白，在中欧建立无原子武器区是一项防止战争危险的好办法，美国当局怎能把它说成是“极端危险”的计划呢？原来是这样：美国国务院告诉它的下属，如果接受波兰的计划，那美国就需要改变以建立前进基地为基础的战略方针了。说得清楚些，如果在中欧建立了无原子武器区，美国就不能在那里搞原子战争基地。对于美国的战争计划来说，波兰的建议可不是“极端危险”的吗？
    然而对美国战争计划的危险威胁正是世界人民安全之所在。西欧各国舆论要求接受波兰建议的压力正日益增大，美国驻西欧使节要执行他们上级的指示，恐怕不是那么容易的事情。
