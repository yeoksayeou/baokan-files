Hand Over Your Heart to Socialism and the Communist Party
Chen Qiyou Representative Discusses the Transformation of Democratic Party Members

The past year, 1957, was a year of great victory for socialism worldwide, a year when the East Wind prevailed over the West Wind. Internationally, this victory was marked by the astounding achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology, the publication of the two Moscow Declarations, the success of socialist countries in construction, and the upsurge of the peace movement worldwide, etc. In our country, this victory was marked by the comprehensive and over-fulfilled completion of the First Five-Year Plan in the economic sphere, and the victories of the nationwide rectification campaign and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists in the political and ideological spheres.

At this meeting, we heard Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft of the 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft of the 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee Wu Yuzhang's "Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme." We also heard reports from representatives from all fields about the victories achieved on various production fronts and the unparalleled high production morale of the broad masses of the people. These reports powerfully illustrate that everything in our country is thriving and has the potential for a great leap forward. In 1957, our national budget, despite some financial difficulties in the winter of 1956, was still implemented very well, and according to estimates, there was still a surplus. In 1957, our economic construction plan was also completed very well. Just consider the drafting of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, which concerns 600 million people. Which government of all the previous reactionary rulers would have been willing to serve the people so wholeheartedly?

On the basis of the comprehensive and over-fulfilled completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the Second Five-Year Plan for national economic construction, which begins this year, will undoubtedly be able to move forward with assurance. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao instructed us that the success or failure of the Second Five-Year Plan depends on the first three years, the first three years depend on the first year, and the first year depends on the first month. Judging from the existing achievements and the exciting revolutionary drive of the people across the country, we have every reason to say that our country will be able to complete or over-fulfill the targets set in the Second Five-Year Plan in all aspects. Not only that, we also have full confidence that, in accordance with the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we will catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and major industrial products in about fifteen years. The Chinese nation is truly "full of hope."

When we think of our achievements, we cannot help but think of the great nationwide rectification campaign and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, which are still underway under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Although this movement has not yet completely ended, it has basically achieved extremely great victories. As a result of the anti-Rightist struggle, the people across the country have received a very profound socialist education, thus brightening their eyes, recognizing the ugliness of the rightists, exposing all the shameless slanders they have made against the successes achieved by the country, drawing a clear line between themselves and the rightists, and isolating the rightists. As a result of the thorough rectification carried out and being carried out within the people, bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism have been severely attacked, and a new atmosphere has emerged in state organs. On this basis, the people across the country have a deeper and more concrete understanding of the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, as well as building the country through diligence and thrift, thus their enthusiasm for production has soared unprecedentedly. The root of the great victory in 1957 should be said to be the great movement of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle.

I am a bourgeois intellectual and also a member of a democratic party. The democratic parties have always stated that they trust and obey the leadership of the Communist Party and are willing to exist as assistants to the Communist Party in the great cause of building socialism. However, the process of the anti-Rightist struggle illustrates a fact, namely, that the vast majority of members of the democratic parties with a bourgeois nature are still in an intermediate state, and must undergo a thorough transformation of breaking with the capitalist standpoint and establishing a socialist standpoint before the democratic parties can be worthy of being assistants to the Communist Party and political organizations serving socialism, and can be worthy of coexisting with the Communist Party for a long time. Therefore, on the basis of the victory already achieved in the anti-Rightist struggle, the democratic parties should actively carry out a general rectification movement with the change of standpoint as its content, and then gradually move into rectification to reform their work style and methods. Members of the democratic parties, including myself, must be determined to accept socialist transformation, change our bourgeois standpoint to a socialist standpoint, hand our hearts completely over to socialism and the Communist Party, muster revolutionary enthusiasm, and strive upward together with the people of the whole country to fight for the great socialist construction of the motherland.

    把心交给社会主义和共产党
    陈其尤代表谈民主党派成员的改造问题
    过去的一年，一九五七年，是社会主义在全世界取得伟大胜利的一年，是东风压倒西风的一年。在国际上标志着这种胜利的，为苏联在科学技术上的惊人成就、莫斯科两个宣言的发表、社会主义各国建设上的成功，以及和平运动在全世界范围内的高涨等等；在我们的国家，标志着这种胜利的，则是国民经济建设第一个五年计划全面地完成和超额完成的在经济战线上的胜利和全民整风运动以及反对资产阶级右派斗争在政治战线上思想战线上的胜利。
    在这一次会议上，我们听到李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”，薄一波副总理所作的“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”，彭真副委员长所作的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”，中国文字改革委员会吴玉章主任所作的“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，还听到来自各方面的代表们关于各个生产战线上获致胜利和广大人民生产情绪无比高昂的生动事实的报告。这些报告有力地说明了我们国家的一切都是蓬蓬勃勃在前进的，而且都是具有大跃进的潜力的。一九五七年，我们的国家预算，虽然在一九五六年冬季国家财政有一些困难的情况下，仍然执行得很好，根据预计，还有结余；一九五七年，我们的经济建设计划同样完成得很好。再就关系到六亿人民的汉语拼音方案的草拟来说罢，试问以前一切反动统治者有那一个政府肯这样全心全意地为人民来服务的。
    在第一个五年计划这样全面完成和超额完成的基础上，无疑地将使今年开始的国民经济建设第二个五年计划可以有保证地迈步前进。中共中央和毛主席指示我们第二个五年计划的成功与否，要看头三年，头三年要看头一年，头一年要看头一月。从现有的成绩看，再从全国人民动人心弦的革命干劲来看，我们有充分的理由说，我们国家是能够在各方面完成或超额完成第二个五年计划所规定的指标的。不仅这样，我们还有充分的信心，按照中共中央和毛主席的号召在十五年左右的时间内在钢铁和主要工业产品的产量上赶上或超过英国。中华民族实在是“大有希望”的。
    想到我们的成绩就不能不想到迄今仍在进行的在中共中央和毛主席领导下的全民整风和反对资产阶级右派的伟大运动。这个运动，现在虽还没有完全结束，但是基本上已获得了极其伟大的胜利。由于反右派斗争，使全国人民受到很深刻的社会主义教育，因而擦亮了自己的眼睛，认清了右派分子的丑恶，拆穿了他们对国家所获得的成功所进行的一切无耻诬蔑，同右派分子划清了界限，把右派分子孤立起来；由于在人民内部进行了和进行着彻底的整风，使官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义受到狠狠的打击，使国家机关出现了新气象。在这种基础上，全国人民对于多、快、好、省以及勤俭建国等原则有更深刻而具体的认识，从而对生产的劲头空前高涨。一九五七年的伟大胜利的根源应当说是由于有了全民整风和反右派斗争这一个伟大运动。
    我是一个资产阶级的知识分子，亦是民主党派的成员之一。民主党派一向是表明信赖并服从共产党的领导，并愿在建设社会主义的伟大事业中作为共产党的助手而存在的。然而反右派斗争运动的过程说明了一个事实，即，资产阶级性的民主党派的成员绝大多数还是处于中间状态，还必须经过破资本主义立场立社会主义立场的脱胎换骨的改造，民主党派才能配称为共产党的助手和为社会主义服务的政治团体，才能配与共产党长期存在。因此，民主党派应当在反右派斗争已经取得胜利的基础上，积极进行以改变立场为内容的一般整风运动，然后才能逐步转入整顿改革工作作风和工作方法。民主党派的成员，包括我自己在内，必须下定决心，接受社会主义改造，改变自己的资产阶级立场为社会主义立场，把我们的心完全交与社会主义和共产党，鼓起革命干劲，与全国人民一起，力争上游，为祖国伟大的社会主义建设而奋斗。
