Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 21st: The Egyptian government issued a statement this afternoon saying that the Egyptian government has decided to postpone the resolution of its border issue with Sudan until after the Sudanese general election. The purpose of doing so is to maintain the friendly relations that link the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples together. The Sudanese general election is scheduled to be held on February 27.

The statement said that negotiations to resolve the border issue will be held immediately after the formation of the new Sudanese cabinet.

The statement said, "Egypt, which has been cooperating with Sudan for the freedom and independence of Sudan, has taken this step mainly to thwart the conspiracies of those malicious people who have repeatedly taken the opportunity to worsen relations between the two countries." The statement continued, "Egypt has ignored the provocative acts that attempted to create the impression of armed intervention or aggression against Sudanese territory when there were no Egyptian troops on the southern border other than the normal border patrol."

The statement said, "The Egyptian government reiterates that the establishment of the Egyptian armed forces is not for the purpose of invading Sudan, but to help it resist the common enemy."

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council met on the evening of February 21 to discuss the border dispute between Egypt and Sudan.

The representatives of Sudan and Egypt presented their respective situations on this issue at the meeting on the 21st.

After listening to the statements of the Sudanese and Egyptian representatives, the President of the Security Council, Soviet representative Sobolev, suggested that the Security Council stop discussing this issue based on the expression of both sides' willingness to resolve their disputes peacefully after the Sudanese general election. The Security Council unanimously agreed to this suggestion and decided to postpone the discussion of this issue indefinitely.

Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, February 22nd: Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil and Interior Minister Rahman both expressed their welcome on the 21st to the Egyptian government's statement on postponing the resolution of the border issue until after the Sudanese general election. Al-Azhari, leader of the National Union Party, who is campaigning in Malakal in the south, also welcomed the Egyptian statement. He said that the border dispute could then be resolved through negotiations.

The news about postponing the resolution of the border dispute was broadcast here in the afternoon of the 21st, and the newspapers here issued extra editions for this matter.

Public opinion here generally welcomes Egypt's conciliatory step. They believe that this step helps to eliminate opportunities for imperialists to operate and helps to eliminate the possibility of imperialists using disputes to interfere.

    苏丹政界和舆论欢迎埃及的声明
    新华社开罗21日电　埃及政府在今天下午发表声明说，埃及政府已经决定把它同苏丹的边界问题推迟到苏丹举行大选以后解决。这样做的目的是为了保持把埃及人民和苏丹人民联结在一起的友好关系。苏丹大选预定在2月27日举行。
    声明说，解决边界问题的谈判将在苏丹新内阁成立后立即举行。
    声明说，“为了苏丹的自由和独立而一直同苏丹合作的埃及所以采取这个步骤，主要是为了挫折那些曾经多次利用机会来使这两个国家的关系恶化的怀有恶意的人的阴谋。”声明接着说，“埃及没有理睬那种企图在南部边境除了正常的边境巡逻队以外并没有埃及军队的时候，制造武装干涉或者侵略苏丹领土的印象的挑拨行为。”
    声明说，“埃及政府再次宣布，埃及武装部队的建立并不是为了侵略苏丹，而是为了帮助它抵抗共同的敌人。”
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会2月21日晚间开会讨论了埃及同苏丹的边界纠纷问题。
    苏丹和埃及的代表在21日的会议上分别就这一问题陈述了情况。
    会议在听取了苏丹和埃及代表的陈述以后，安全理事会主席、苏联代表索波列夫根据双方都愿意在苏丹大选以后用和平方法解决它们之间的争端的表示，建议安全理事会停止就这一问题进行讨论。安全理事会一致表示同意这一建议，决定不定期地延期讨论这一问题。
    新华社喀土穆22日电　苏丹总理哈利勒和内政部长拉赫曼21日都表示欢迎埃及政府关于把边界问题推迟到苏丹大选后再行解决的声明。正在南部马拉卡尔进行竞选的民族联合党领袖阿扎里也欢迎埃及的声明。他说，这样，边界争端就能够通过谈判来解决。
    21日下午在这里广播了有关延期解决边界争端的消息，这里的报纸为这件事出了号外。
    这里舆论普遍欢迎埃及的这个和解的步骤。它们认为，这个步骤有助于消除帝国主义者活动的机会，有助于消除帝国主义者利用纠纷进行干涉的可能性。
