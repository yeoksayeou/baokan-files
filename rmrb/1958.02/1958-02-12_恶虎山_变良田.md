    "Evil Tiger Mountain" Transformed into Fertile Land
    In Linjiang County in southern Jilin, there is a Wolong (Crouching) Tiger Mountain. In the old society, the trees on the mountain were burned and felled, resulting in severe soil erosion and declining yields year after year. Farmers moved away one after another, calling it "Evil Tiger Mountain."
    Now, "Evil Tiger Mountain" is covered with terraced fields, and the mountain slopes are full of ditch-building, fish-scale pits, fruit trees, and protective forest belts. Last year, the corn yield here was more than 5,000 jin per hectare. This achievement has set an example for the entire mountainous county. On the 8th, the Jilin Daily published a detailed report by reporter Chen Youting on this creation and published an editorial on the first page entitled "Starting from Wolong Tiger Mountain," believing that with such a successful experience, the work of controlling soil erosion now has a model.

    “恶虎山”变良田
    吉林南部的临江县有个卧虎山。在旧社会山上的树木被烧砍一光，水土流失严重，产量年年下降，农民纷纷搬走，他们叫它是“恶虎山”。
    现在的“恶虎山”遍山梯田、山坡上下尽是谷坊、鱼鳞坑、果树、防护林带工程。去年这里的玉米每公顷产五千多斤。这个成绩给全县山区树起了一面旗帜。8日吉林日报刊登了记者陈有廷对这一创造的详细报道并在一版发表了题为“从卧虎山谈起”的社论，认为有了这样一个成功的经验，控制水土流失的工作就有了榜样。
