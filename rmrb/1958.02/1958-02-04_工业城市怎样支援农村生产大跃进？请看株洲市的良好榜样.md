How Can Industrial Cities Support the Great Leap Forward in Rural Production?
　　Please See the Good Example of Zhuzhou City
    Changsha, February 3rd (Reporter Fan Rongkang) – How can industrial cities support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in suburban areas? Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, has set a good example. All factories, government offices, and schools in the city are linked with an agricultural production cooperative, responsible for supporting agricultural production in all aspects. All engineering and technical personnel in the city have been organized to study and improve agricultural machinery. All aspects of urban work pay attention to supporting agriculture, strengthening urban-rural relations, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. According to Ma Zhuangkun, First Secretary of the Zhuzhou Municipal Party Committee, with the strong support of the city, the Zhuzhou suburbs will basically achieve the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development within three years.
    Supporting Agricultural Production is the Responsibility of Industrial Cities Zhuzhou is located on the bank of the Xiang River. Before liberation, it was a small town of 7,000 people belonging to Xiangtan County. After 1953, it gradually developed into the largest industrial city in Hunan Province. Now it has a population of 180,000, including 110,000 urban residents. In the past few years, although Zhuzhou City has done a lot of work in supporting agricultural production, such as organizing workers and technicians to help farmers build water conservancy projects and fight drought, the idea of mobilizing the city to support agriculture was not very clear. Last year, after the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially encouraged and promoted by the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the Zhuzhou Municipal Party Committee clearly stated that supporting agricultural production is the responsibility of industrial cities, and quickly took measures to form a surge of supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture throughout the city.
    Now, all the larger factories, government offices, and schools in Zhuzhou City have been linked with nearby agricultural cooperatives, responsible for four aspects of work: 1. Assisting local Party organizations in political and ideological work and current affairs propaganda; 2. Helping agricultural cooperatives increase production technically; 3. Providing manpower on the premise of not affecting production, work and study; 4. Helping agricultural cooperatives solve the supply of agricultural production materials as much as possible.
    Organizing City Engineering and Technical Personnel to Trial-Produce Agricultural Machinery Zhuzhou is a newly emerging heavy industrial city with complete mechanical equipment and strong engineering and technical forces. Now, the Machinery Research Institute and the Science Popularization Association are organizing a "Technical Research Institute for Supporting Agriculture." In addition to equipping full-time engineering and technical personnel, it also organizes city engineering and technical personnel to use their spare time to research and trial-produce agricultural machinery. More than ten types are planned to be trial-produced and promoted this year. Hunan lacks animal power and rural labor, but transportation still relies on people carrying and pushing wheelbarrows that can only carry two to three hundred catties. Now, the "Technical Research Institute for Supporting Agriculture" is preparing to trial-produce animal-powered and human-powered rubber-wheeled vehicles suitable for the road characteristics of the South. It also plans to organize scientists in the city to contract areas, carry out science popularization education for farmers regularly in their spare time, and gradually establish technical night schools in agricultural cooperatives.
    Planned Discharge of Sewage to Rural Areas, Benefiting Both Urban and Rural Areas The construction of factories requires requisitioning land and often easily damages the original water conservancy system in rural areas. Zhuzhou City pays great attention to this aspect of work, striving to avoid similar situations. Not only that, but Zhuzhou City also actively considers farmland water conservancy issues while planning urban construction. Zhuzhou City has three waterways, all converging into the Xiang River. Whenever the Xiang River rises, it often backflows and causes disasters. Last year, when it was decided to build a bridge on the Baishi Port, it was also decided to set up a gate under the bridge. In this way, although the municipal construction investment will increase by 150,000 yuan, 6,200 mu of rice fields can be protected from floods and can be replanted with double-cropping rice, which can increase grain production by 500 jin per mu on average. The income from increased production in two years can recover all the investment. Urban sewage is an excellent fertilizer for rural areas. Zhuzhou City began using sewage for irrigation in 1956, and now 2,500 mu of farmland has been irrigated with urban sewage. It is planned to use all 7,600 tons of sewage produced in the city every day, and increase the area irrigated by sewage to 8,300 mu this year. Farmland irrigated with urban sewage can produce 1,000 jin of grain per mu without adding other fertilizers, only some lime. Now the new sewage system is being surveyed intensively. Small projects in the sewage system will be invested by agricultural cooperatives using the sewage, while large projects will be invested by the state. In this way, although the state will spend more money, newly built factories do not need to build septic tanks, and all factories can use less bleach, which is still cost-effective. Zhuzhou City slaughters 70,000 pigs every year, which can produce 600,000 jin of pig bones. Pig bones can not only extract bone marrow oil for industrial use, but bone meal is also a good fertilizer. Starting from February 1, Zhuzhou has stopped selling pig bones, all of which are used to make bone marrow oil and bone meal. In addition, transportation departments, commercial departments, and postal and telecommunications departments have also formulated plans to support rural areas.
    Urban and Rural Mutual Assistance is Full of Enthusiasm, Striving to Achieve the Forty Articles in Three Years The people of the whole city have launched activities to support rural areas. This year, in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign, one million dan of fertilizer will be accumulated for rural areas, and 560,000 dan have already been completed. In the recent water conservancy movement, workers alone have supported 6,000 man-times, and technicians have surveyed eight reservoirs for farmers in more than ten days.
    The Zhuzhou suburbs are full of enthusiasm with the strong support of the city. They plan to catch up with the level of local well-to-do middle peasants this year, achieve the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development within three years, and ensure that grain production per mu reaches 1,000 jin this year. It is also decided to achieve a vegetable yield of 10,000 jin per mu this year, and an annual output of 123,000 pigs, doubling the output of last year. The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in the Zhuzhou suburbs will more powerfully support the city's industrial and transportation construction. Many directors of agricultural cooperatives gave reports to factories, government offices, and schools, giving great encouragement to the people of the city.

　　工业城市怎样支援农村生产大跃进？
　　请看株洲市的良好榜样
    本报长沙3日电　记者范荣康报道：工业城市怎样支援郊区农村的生产大跃进？湖南省株洲市已做出了良好榜样。这个城市所有的工厂、机关和学校都分别同一个农业生产合作社挂上钩，负责从各方面来支援农业生产；全市工程技术人员都被组织起来，研究改良农业机械；城市工作的各方面都注意了支援农业，密切城乡关系，巩固工农联盟；全市人民都参加了支援农村的活动。据株洲市委第一书记马壮昆说：在城市大力支援下，株洲郊区将在三年内基本实现农业发展纲要四十条。
    支援农业生产是工业城市的责任　株洲位于湘江之滨，解放前是湘潭县所属一个七千人口的小镇，1953年后，逐渐发展为湖南省最大的工业城市。现在拥有十八万人口，其中城市人口十一万人。过去几年来，株洲市虽然也在支援农业生产方面做了不少工作，如组织工人和技术人员帮助农民兴修水利，抗旱救灾等等，但发动城市支援农业的思想还不十分明确。去年，党中央三中全会以后，特别是在农业大跃进的鼓舞和推动之下，中共株洲市委明确了支援农业生产乃是工业城市的责任，迅速采取了措施，在全市形成了一个支援农业大跃进的热潮。
    现在，株洲市所有较大的工厂、机关、学校都已同附近的农业社挂上了钩，负责四个方面的工作：一、协助当地党组织做政治思想工作和时事宣传工作；二、从技术上帮助农业社增产；三、在不影响生产、工作和学习的前提下，提供人力；四、尽可能帮助农业社解决农业生产的器材供应问题。
    组织全市工程技术人员试制农业机械　株洲是一个新兴的重工业城市，各种机械设备齐全，工程技术力量很大。现在正由机械研究所和科学普及协会出面组织一个“支援农业技术研究所”，除配备专职工程技术人员外，并组织全市工程技术人员利用业余时间，研究和试制农业机械。今年计划试制和推广的就有十种以上。湖南畜力不足，农村劳动力缺乏，但运输还得靠人挑，人推的独轮车也只能载重二、三百斤。现在，“支援农业技术研究所”正准备试制一种适合南方道路特点的畜力和人力的胶轮车；还计划组织全市科学工作者分片包干，利用业余时间定期向农民进行科学普及教育，在农业社内逐步建立技术夜校。
    有计划地向农村排灌污水，城乡两利　建设工厂就要征用土地，常常容易破坏农村原有的水利系统。株洲市非常注意这方面的工作，力求避免类似的情况。不仅如此，株洲市在规划城市建设的同时，还主动地考虑农田水利问题。株洲市共有三条水港，尽皆汇入湘江。每逢湘江水涨，常常倒灌成灾。去年决定在白石港建桥时，就同时决定在桥下设闸，这样，市政建设投资虽然要增加十五万元，但六千二百亩稻田可免受水灾，并可改种双季稻，平均每亩可增产粮食五百斤，两年增产所得，就可把全部投资收回。城市污水是农村极好的肥料，株洲市从1956年起就开始利用污水灌田，现在已有二千五百亩农田受到城市污水灌溉。计划要把城市每天所有七千六百吨污水全部利用起来，今年内使污水灌溉面积增至八千三百亩。受到城市污水灌溉的农田，不加其他肥料，只用些石灰，每亩都可争取生产粮食一千斤。现在新的污水系统正在加紧勘测中。污水系统中的小工程，将由使用污水的农业社投资，大工程则是国家投资。这样，国家虽然要多花一些钱，但新建的工厂可以不建化粪池，所有的工厂都可以少用大量漂白粉，也还是合算的。株洲市每年宰杀生猪七万头，可出猪骨六十万斤。猪骨不但可以提炼骨髓油用到工业上去，骨粉也是很好的肥料。2月1日起，株洲已停售猪骨，全部用于制骨髓油和骨粉。此外，运输部门、商业部门、邮电部门也都订出了支援农村的计划。
    城乡互助干劲十足，争取三年实现四十条　全市人民都展开了支援农村的活动。今年内要结合爱国卫生运动，为农村积肥一百万担，现已完成了五十六万担。最近的水利运动中，仅工人已支援人工六千人次，技术人员在十多天中为农民测量了八个水库。
    株洲郊区在城市大力支援下，干劲十足。他们计划在今年内赶上当地富裕中农的水平，三年内实现农业发展纲要四十条，保证今年粮食亩产一千斤。还决定今年就实现蔬菜亩产一万斤，生猪年产十二万三千头，比去年增产一倍。株洲郊区农业生产的大跃进，将更有力地支援城市的工业交通建设。许多农业社的主任到工厂、机关和学校做报告，给城市人民很大的鼓舞。
