　　Asia Does Not Want Atomic Weapons
　　*People's Daily* Commentator
    In his recent statements, Indian Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly stated his opposition to the establishment of rocket bases in Europe or Asia, advocating the establishment of regions free from weapons of mass destruction. He said that the larger the area and the greater the number of such regions, the better it would be for the world. At the same time, Prime Minister Nehru also mentioned that India itself not only does not ask others to give it atomic bombs, but on the contrary, "we will not manufacture atomic bombs, we will not use atomic bombs."
    Prime Minister Nehru's remarks and propositions have positive significance in the current international situation and are worthy of attention. This is because the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are still stepping up preparations for atomic war, regardless of the opposition of peace-loving people and governments of all countries. These sinister activities of imperialism cannot but cause uneasiness to everyone who cares about world peace. Human reason and conscience demand that everyone rise up to oppose and eliminate the threat of atomic war and give peace to the world. Prime Minister Nehru's remarks reflect the peace aspirations of millions of people and are a voice of reason and conscience.
    For us Asians, Prime Minister Nehru's proposal is even easier to understand. The people of Asia were the first to suffer the disaster of atomic weapons. First-hand experience tells us that turning Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free zone is in the best interest of the people of all Asian countries. The Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving Asian countries are working to free Asia from the threat of atomic war and consolidate lasting peace in Asia and the world. Although the Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons, it has always advocated banning such weapons and has proposed to stop atomic weapons testing together with the United States and Britain. These circumstances show that for the people of Asian countries, the threat of atomic war does not come from Asian countries themselves, but from outside Asia.
    The fact we see is that while the United States refuses to stop testing and banning atomic weapons, it is establishing missile bases everywhere from the Americas to Europe and from Europe to Asia. In the Far East, the United States has turned Okinawa into an atomic war base, deployed "Matador" missiles in our territory of Taiwan, shipped "Sidewinder" missiles to Japan, and shipped atomic cannons into South Korea. During the Baghdad Pact Ankara meeting, the United States not only forced Turkey to agree to establish missile bases on its territory, but also conspired to establish missile bases in other Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact. These activities of the United States are obviously aimed at establishing atomic weapons bases in many regions of Asia, vainly attempting to launch atomic war in places far away from the United States. Therefore, to turn Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and to eliminate the threat of atomic war to Asia, we must resolutely oppose the United States establishing missile bases and storing atomic weapons in Asia. Prime Minister Nehru is right, "Atomic bombs coming to Asia will cause a terrible wave of opposition everywhere."
    While opposing the establishment of rocket bases in Asia, Prime Minister Nehru also stated that India will never accept atomic bombs and will make India a country that does not produce or use atomic bombs. This is also a wise and positive peace proposition.
    We believe that Prime Minister Nehru's remarks and propositions will receive positive evaluation and widespread support in Asia.

　　亚洲不要原子武器
　　本报评论员
    印度总理尼赫鲁在他最近发表的各项言论中，一再申明反对在欧洲或亚洲建立火箭基地，主张建立没有大规模毁灭性武器的地区。他说，这种地区的面积越大，数量越多，对世界越有好处。同时，尼赫鲁总理还提到印度本身不但不要求别人给予原子弹，相反地，“我们不会制造原子弹，我们不会使用原子弹”。
    尼赫鲁总理的这些言论和主张，在当前的国际形势下有其积极的意义，是值得人们重视的。因为以美国为首的帝国主义国家现在仍然不顾各国爱好和平人民和政府的反对，正在加紧准备原子战争。帝国主义的这些罪恶的活动不能不引起每个关心世界和平的人们的不安，人类的理智和良心要求大家起来反对和消除原子战争的威胁，给世界以和平。尼赫鲁总理的言论反映了千百万人民的和平愿望，是理智与良心的呼声。
    对于我们亚洲人民来说，尼赫鲁总理的主张更是容易理解的。亚洲人民最先受到原子武器的灾难。切身的经验告诉我们，把亚洲变为无原子区是符合亚洲各国人民的最大利益的。苏联、中国及其他爱好和平的亚洲国家，都在努力促使亚洲摆脱原子战争的威胁，巩固亚洲及世界的持久和平。苏联虽然拥有原子武器，但它一向就主张禁止这种武器，并建议同美英一起停止原子武器的试验。这些情况表明，对亚洲各国人民来说，原子战争的威胁不是来自亚洲国家本身，而是来自亚洲之外。
    我们看到的事实是，美国一边拒绝停止试验和禁止原子武器，一边正在从美洲到欧洲，又从欧洲到亚洲，到处建立导弹基地。在远东，美国把冲绳变成了原子战争基地，把“斗牛士”导弹配置在我国的领土台湾，把“响尾蛇”式导弹运给日本，并且把原子大炮运进南朝鲜。在巴格达条约集团安卡拉会议期间，美国不仅迫使土耳其同意在其领土上建立导弹基地，并且阴谋策划在巴格达条约的其他穆斯林成员国内建立导弹基地。美国的这些活动显然是要在亚洲的许多地区建立原子武器基地，妄想利用远离美国本土的地方发动原子战争。因此，要把亚洲变为无原子区，要消除原子战争对亚洲的威胁，就必须坚决反对美国在亚洲建立导弹基地和储存原子武器。尼赫鲁总理说得对，“原子弹到亚洲来将会到处引起反对它的可怕的浪潮”。
    尼赫鲁总理在反对在亚洲建立火箭基地的同时，还表示印度决不接受原子弹，而且要使印度成为不生产、不使用原子弹的国家。这也是明智的和具有积极意义的和平主张。
    我们相信，尼赫鲁总理的这些言论和主张会在亚洲得到肯定的评价和广泛的支持。
