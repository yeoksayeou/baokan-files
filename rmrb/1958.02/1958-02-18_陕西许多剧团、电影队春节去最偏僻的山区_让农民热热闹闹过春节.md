Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 16th: Many theatrical troupes and film projection teams in Shaanxi Province are preparing to go to the most remote areas during the Spring Festival holiday to perform and let the farmers in those areas also have a lively Spring Festival. The Xi'an Municipal Song and Dance Troupe will soon go to the temples of three counties bordering Chang'an, Lantian, and Xi'an to perform.

The farmers here have not seen a play for more than twenty years. Hearing that the best troupe in the province is coming to them, they have specially cleaned up their residences to welcome the arrival of the troupe.

Theatrical troupes or film projection teams in Ankang, Pingli, Huanglong, and Chunhua and other places have recently gone to the mountainous areas to perform. Ankang and Huanglong counties have also organized socialist cultural propaganda teams of more than forty people to tour the mountainous areas, performing and publicizing the current domestic and international situation.

It is estimated that the number of performances by various theatrical troupes in Shaanxi Province in mountainous areas this year can account for 30% to 50% of the total number of performances, and the number of screenings by film projection teams in mountainous areas will also greatly increase. The Provincial People's Theater has decided to send the best actors and programs to the Yulin desert area and the Great Wall line in northern Shaanxi to perform, and ensure that it travels all over the mountainous areas of the province within three years.

    让农民热热闹闹过春节
    新华社西安16日电　陕西省许多剧团、电影放映队春节假期准备到最偏僻的地方去演出，让那些地方的农民也过个热闹的春节。西安市歌舞剧团最近将到长安、蓝田、西安交界的山区三县寺演出。
    这里农民二十多年都没看到戏，这次听说省内最好的剧团要到他们那里去，已特地打扫好了住处，迎接剧团的到来。
    安康、平利、黄龙、淳化等地的剧团或电影队最近都已经到山区演出。安康、黄龙两县还组织了四十多人的社会主义文化宣传大队，到山区巡回演出，并宣传当前国内外形势。
    预计陕西各剧团今年到山区演出的场数，可占演出总场数的30％到50％，电影放映队到山区放映的场数也大为增加。省人民剧团已决定把最好的演员和节目一齐送到陕北榆林沙漠地带和长城线上演出，保证三年内走遍全省山区。
