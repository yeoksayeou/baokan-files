Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 24th - The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak National Front jointly held a special meeting in Prague this morning to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the February Victory.

    First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee and President of the Republic, Novotný, spoke at the meeting. When talking about the February events, he pointed out that the February victory meant the completion of the revolutionary process of the Czechoslovak people's democratic system becoming a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victory of this event fully proved that the political line formulated by the Eighth Party Congress was absolutely correct. He said that the great achievements Czechoslovakia has made in the past ten years will make it possible for the upcoming Eleventh Party Congress to propose the task of completing the socialist construction of the country.

    Novotný said that the existence of a people's democratic Czechoslovakia and the construction of socialism were made possible because the Soviet Union is our liberator, friend, and ally, because we are part of the powerful socialist camp, and because we have the support of the entire international workers' revolutionary movement. He also emphasized that this is also a guarantee of Czechoslovakia's national independence and national freedom.

    At the meeting, Czechoslovak enterprise collectives, worker collectives, and agricultural cooperatives, as well as some workers, were awarded medals and honorary titles to reward them for their contributions to the country.

    庆祝捷二月事件胜利十周年
    捷共中央和民族阵线联合集会
    新华社布拉格24日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会和捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线中央委员会今天上午在布拉格联合举行特别会议，庆祝二月事件胜利十周年。
    捷共中央第一书记、共和国总统诺沃提尼在会上讲了话。他在谈到二月事件时指出，二月胜利意味着捷克斯洛伐克人民民主制度成为无产阶级专政的形式的革命过程的完成。这一事件的胜利完全证明了党的第八次代表大会所制定的政治路线是绝对正确的。他说，捷克斯洛伐克在过去十年中取得的巨大成就将使得即将召开的第十一次党代表大会有可能提出完成国家社会主义建设的任务。
    诺沃提尼说，人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的存在和建设社会主义之所以成为可能，是因为苏联是我们的解放者、朋友和盟国，因为我们是强大的社会主义阵营的一部分，因为我们有着整个国际工人革命运动的支持。他还强调指出，这也是捷克斯洛伐克国家独立和民族自由的保证。
    会上，授予捷克斯洛伐克企业集体、工人集体和农业合作社以及一些工人以勋章和荣誉称号，以奖励他们为国家所建树的功绩。
