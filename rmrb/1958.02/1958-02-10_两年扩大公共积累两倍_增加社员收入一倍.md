Rao Xingli, Representative, Discusses the October Agricultural Cooperative's Plan for Correctly Handling the Relationship Between the Collective and the Individual
    Doubling Public Accumulation in Two Years, Doubling Members' Income
    Accumulate More in Good Years, Less in Lean Years; the More Production Develops, the More We Must Accumulate

    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, on "The Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," and suggest that the congress approve them. Today, I would like to express some opinions on increasing production, expanding public accumulation, and correctly handling the issue of accumulation and distribution to members.

    Our October Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, accumulated a total of 20,000 yuan in the three years from the establishment of the elementary cooperative in 1952 to its transformation into an advanced cooperative in 1955, and further developed to 55,000 yuan by the end of 1957. The cooperative now has seven water pumps, fourteen flatbed carts, four threshers, sixteen double-wheel double-share plows, and thirteen 7-inch walking plows and improved plows; it has built five flatbed cart roads; and it has established a primary school, a health clinic, a drama troupe, a club, and a broadcasting room. The income of members has also increased from an average of about 50 yuan per person in 1952, to an average of about 67 yuan per person in 1955, to an average of about 100 yuan per person in 1957. Due to the continuous increase in public accumulation on the basis of production growth, the cooperative's means of production have also greatly increased, and the material and cultural life of the members has improved to a certain extent accordingly, which in turn has promoted the increasing consolidation of the cooperative and the greater development of production. We deeply realize that only by correctly handling the relationship between the collective and the individual, that is, by correctly determining the ratio of internal accumulation and distribution to members, by continuously increasing the cooperative's public accumulation and expanding the cooperative's basic construction investment on the basis of production growth and the gradual increase of members' income (except in years of major disasters), can there be a solid material foundation for the greater development of internal production and the further consolidation of the cooperative's organization. In order to further expand accumulation and increase income on the basis of production growth, we plan to strive for an average grain yield of 1,400 jin per mu of paddy field in the whole cooperative in 1958, and an average grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu in 1959, basically achieving a doubling of public accumulation and a doubling of members' income within two years.

    However, in the past, especially before 1956, we were not clear enough in our thinking about how agricultural cooperatives should correctly handle the relationship between the collective and the individual. The cooperative cadres emphasized keeping less and distributing more in their thinking (which was appropriate in the early stages of establishing the cooperative), emphasizing the increase in members' income, and paying insufficient attention to the increase in the cooperative's public accumulation, and lacking a sufficient understanding of its important significance; the members, under the influence of the idea of relying on the cooperative, one-sidedly emphasized improving their lives, believing that in the past, they would buy fields and land if they had money, and now that they could not exploit others, they could only improve their lives. This erroneous thinking was most evident in 1956, when more than 50 households in the whole cooperative overspent more than 3,000 yuan throughout the year, the vast majority of whom were not households with difficulties due to a lack of labor or large families. The main reason for the overspending was the failure to establish the idea of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, managing the household diligently and thriftily, and regarding the cooperative as home. For example, the income from household sideline occupations of cooperative members in 1957 was more than 24,000 yuan, while it was only 10,000 yuan in 1956; in 1957, vegetables were grown and eaten by themselves, while in 1956, they generally bought vegetables to eat; in 1957, an average of 3.7 pigs were raised per household, while in 1956, an average of less than one pig per household was raised.

    I believe that the principle of correctly handling the relationship between the collective and the individual should be: "Accumulate more in bumper years, accumulate less in poor years, and accumulate more as production develops." The specific method is: the portion distributed to the members should be based on the absolute amount distributed in the previous year, and a ratio of accumulation and distribution should be determined for the portion of income increased due to increased production; if production increases a lot, the proportion distributed to the members should be small, and if production increases little, the proportion distributed to the members should be slightly larger, with a maximum limit of no more than 40 percent of the increased production; if production is reduced due to major natural disasters that are irresistible by human power, and the income of the members cannot reach the absolute amount distributed in the previous year, the principle of maintaining the minimum living standards of the members should be adhered to, organizing the members to produce to overcome the famine, and not touching or minimizing the use of the cooperative's public accumulation. The advantage of handling the relationship between the collective and the individual in this way is that in normal years, it not only takes into account the gradual increase in the personal income of the members, but also ensures the continuous and relatively rapid increase in the cooperative's public accumulation. The actual distribution situation in our cooperative in the past two years is: in 1956, the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations was 169,000 yuan, of which 112,000 yuan was distributed to the members, accounting for 67 percent, and 17,000 yuan was accumulated, accounting for 10 percent; in 1957, the total income was 180,000 yuan, of which 117,000 yuan was distributed to the members, accounting for 65 percent, and 18,000 yuan was accumulated, accounting for 10 percent. Although the percentage of the members' income in the total income in 1957 decreased by 2 percentage points compared with 1956, the actual income of the members increased somewhat compared with 1956, and the public accumulation of the cooperative also increased slightly. In 1958, the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations in the whole cooperative is planned to be 280,000 yuan, and it is planned to be distributed according to the above-mentioned principles, that is, the actual figure distributed to the members in 1957 will be used as the base, and 30 percent of the income increased due to increased production will be given to the members, so that the actual income of the members will be 166,000 yuan (117,000 yuan plus 49,000 yuan), and the total amount distributed to the members will only account for 60 percent of the total income, while the actual income of the members will still increase by 43 percent compared with 1957, and the public accumulation of the cooperative can be increased by 42,000 yuan, accounting for 15 percent. This is an increase of 76.4 percent over the original figure of 55,000 yuan. In 1959, the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations in the whole cooperative is planned to be 350,000 yuan, and it is estimated that 210,000 yuan will be distributed to the members, accounting for 60 percent, and the cooperative's accumulation will be increased by 52,500 yuan, accounting for 15 percent. In this way, it will be possible to achieve a nearly doubling of public accumulation and a nearly doubling of members' income within two years.

    In order to achieve the above-mentioned plan, we must adhere to the principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and managing the household diligently and thriftily, which has been repeatedly instructed to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and constantly expand accumulation and expand production. Only in this way can we further expand accumulation and increase income on the basis of production growth, further consolidate the agricultural production cooperative, and truly make the agricultural cooperative "unbreakable by sticks and impenetrable by knives." Zhang Xi'e, the production captain of the 13th team in our cooperative, could not find an ideal partner in the cooperative, so should she go to another cooperative? But she was reluctant to leave her own cooperative. This example has already initially demonstrated the superiority of increasing the cooperative's public accumulation. In terms of basic construction, we plan to purchase one universal tractor and two threshers in 1958, and during the second five-year plan, each production team will have one Wuhan-made small universal tractor, one thresher, and two flatbed carts in terms of large-scale tools, so as to reduce the burden of labor in production and transportation, alleviate the tension in labor, and further intensify and meticulously cultivate the land, and increase the yield per unit area more quickly and more effectively. Our cooperative does not have much land per capita, and there is no wasteland to be reclaimed, so increasing the yield per unit area is of particular importance. In order to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production, and strive to achieve the plan of doubling public accumulation and doubling members' income within two years, the production enthusiasm of all members has been unprecedentedly high. Of the 645 male and female laborers in the whole cooperative, 80 percent are invested in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation every day. Now, the water conservancy task has been fully completed, and 70 percent of the annual fertilizer accumulation plan has also been completed. At present, all members are further searching for fertilizer sources, increasing fertilizer accumulation, strengthening field management, and resolutely, stubbornly, and confidently striving to achieve a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu within two years, to further expand the cooperative's public accumulation, consolidate the cooperative's organization, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the members.

### 两年扩大公共积累两倍  增加社员收入一倍

　　饶兴礼代表谈十月农业社正确处理集体和个人之间关系的计划
    两年扩大公共积累两倍  增加社员收入一倍
    丰年多积累歉年少积累生产越发展越要多积累
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”、彭真副委员长关于“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”和中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”，建议大会通过。我今天想就增加生产，扩大公共积累，正确地处理积累和对社员的分配的问题发表一点意见。
    我们湖北省浠水县望城乡十月高级农业生产合作社，从一九五二年成立初级社到一九五五年转为高级社三年内共积累资金两万元，截至一九五七年底又发展到五万五千元。现在全社已有抽水机七部，大板车十四部，脱粒机四部，双轮双铧犁十六部，七寸步犁和改良犁十三部；已修建板车路五条；并举办了小学一所，成立了卫生室、剧团、俱乐部、广播室各一个。社员收入也由一九五二年的每人平均约五十元，一九五五年每人平均约六十七元，增长到一九五七年的每人平均约一百元。由于在生产增长的基础上的公共积累的不断增加，因而社的生产资料也有了很大的增长，社员的物质文化生活也相应地有了一定程度的改善，反转来又促进了合作社的日益巩固和生产的更大发展。我们深刻地体会到，只有正确地处理集体和个人之间的关系，即正确地确定社内积累和对社员的分配的比例，在生产增长的基础上，在社员收入逐年有所增加的情况下（特大灾害年景除外），不断地增加社的公共积累，扩大社的基本建设投资，这样社内生产的更大发展，社的组织进一步巩固，才有雄厚的物质基础。为了在生产增长的基础上进一步扩大积累、增加收入，我们计划一九五八年争取全社水田平均亩产粮食一千四百斤，一九五九年平均亩产粮食二千斤，两年内基本上达到公共积累增加两倍，社员收入增加一倍。
    但是，农业社如何正确地处理集体和个人之间的关系的问题，在过去，特别是在一九五六年以前，我们在思想上是不够明确的。社干思想上是强调少留多分（这在办社初期是应该的），强调社员增加收入，对于社的公共积累的增加则注意得不够，对它的重要意义也认识不足；社员则在依赖社的思想的支配下，片面地强调改善生活，他们认为过去有钱就买田买地，现在不能剥削别人了，当然只有改善生活。这种错误思想在一九五六年表现得最明显，全社有五十余户全年超支三千多元，其中绝大多数户都不是缺乏劳力、家大口阔的困难户。超支的主要原因就是没有树立勤俭办社、勤俭持家、以社为家的思想。如一九五七年社员家庭副业收入二万四千余元，一九五六年只一万元，一九五七年蔬菜是自种自食，一九五六年一般是买菜吃，一九五七年平均每户养猪三点七头，一九五六年平均每户却不到一头。
    我认为正确地处理集体和个人之间的关系的原则应该是：“丰收年多积累，歉收年少积累，生产愈发展，积累愈多”。具体办法是：分配给社员的部分，以上年分配的绝对数作基数，因增产而增加的收入部分，再确定一个积累和分配的比例，增产多，分配给社员的比例小，增产少，分配给社员的比例稍大，最高以不超过增产部分的百分之四十为限；如因人力不可抗拒的特大自然灾害造成减产，社员的收入不能达到上年分配的绝对数时，应该以维持社员的最低生活为原则，组织社员生产度荒，不动或尽量少动社的公共积累。这样处理集体和个人之间的关系的好处是，在正常年景下既照顾了社员个人收入的逐年有所增加，又能保证不断地比较迅速地增加社的公共积累。两年来，我们社的实际分配情况是：一九五六年农副业总收入十六万九千元，分配给社员的十一万二千元，占百分之六十七，积累一万七千元，占百分之十，一九五七年总收入十八万元，分配给社员的十一万七千元，占百分之六十五，积累一万八千元，占百分之十。虽然一九五七年社员收入部分占总收入的百分比比一九五六年下降了百分之二，社员的实际收入却比一九五六年有所增加，而社员的公共积累也稍有增长。一九五八年全社农副业总收入计划为二十八万元，拟按上述原则进行分配，即以一九五七年实际分配给社员的数字作基数，因增产而增加的收入部分再以百分之三十分给社员，这样社员的实际收入就是十六万六千元（十一万七千元加四万九千元），分配给社员的总数只占总收入的百分之六十，而社员的实际收入仍较一九五七年增加百分之四十三，社的公共积累却可增加四万二千元，占百分之十五。较原有数五万五千元增加百分之七十六点四。一九五九年全社农副业总收入计划为三十五万元，预计分配给社员二十一万元，占百分之六十，增加社的积累五万二千五百元，占百分之十五。这样在两年内就可以达到公共积累增加近两倍，社员收入增加近一倍。
    为了达到上述计划，必须坚持党中央和毛主席一再指示我们的勤俭办社、勤俭持家的原则，不断地扩大积累、扩大生产。只有这样才能在生产增长的基础上进一步扩大积累，增加收入，才能进一步巩固农业生产合作社，真正地把农业社办得“棒打不散，刀砍不入”。我们社里十三队的生产队长张细娥，在社内找不到理想的对象，到别的社去吧？又舍不得离开自己的社，这个例子就已经初步显示了社的公共积累增加的优越性。在基本建设方面，我们计划在一九五八年购置万能拖拉机一部、脱粒机二部，在第二个五年计划期间达到每个生产队在大型工具方面有武汉制造小型万能拖拉机一部、脱粒机一部、大板车二部，在生产、运输各方面减轻劳动负担，缓和劳动力的紧张状况，以便进一步地精耕细作，更多更快地提高单位面积产量。我社每人平均占地不多，又无荒地可开，因此提高单位面积产量就具有特别重要的意义。为了组织农业生产的大跃进，争取两年内公共积累增加两倍、社员收入增加一倍的计划的实现，全体社员的生产热情空前高涨，全社男女劳动力六百四十五人，每天投入兴修水利和积肥的占百分之八十，现在水利任务已全部完成，全年的积肥计划也已完成百分之七十。目前全体社员正在进一步寻找肥源，增积肥料，加强田间管理，坚决顽强满怀信心地为实现两年内亩产粮食二千斤，为进一步扩大社的公共积累、巩固社的组织、提高社员的物质文化生活水平而奋斗。
