    Notes

    Praise and Criticism Share the Same Principle
    Dulles has been subjected to criticism from all sides recently, but on the 6th he suddenly received praise. U.S. Senator Bridges praised him for successfully resisting the "increasingly loud demands for a summit meeting" and lauded him as "the main propagandist of the free world against the Soviet Union and communism."
    In fact, the very points for which Dulles is praised by Bridges are the very points for which he is being criticized by people of all countries.

    褒贬同一理
    杜勒斯最近一个时期以来受尽了各方面的责骂，6日却忽然受到了称赞。美国参议员布里奇斯赞誉他成功地抵住了“主张召开最高级会议的日益高涨的要求”，称颂他为“自由世界反苏反共的主要宣传家”。
    其实，杜勒斯受布里奇斯夸奖之处也就正是他被各国公众同声责骂之处。
