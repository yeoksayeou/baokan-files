　　Ordinary Experience, Great Power
　　——Introducing Several Major Experiences in the Leadership Work of the CCP Shou Zhang County Committee
　　Chen Xiaodong, Wu Fei, Wang Chengbin
　　Editor's Note: This article was originally published in Shandong Dazhong Daily. When publishing this article, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote an editor's note, which said:
　　"The reason why Shou Zhang County has done a relatively good job in recent years is mainly because the county committee has faithfully studied and firmly implemented the instructions of the Party, and has been able to closely combine the spirit of the Party's instructions with the specific conditions and the demands of the masses in this county; on major issues, the secretary takes the lead personally, follows the mass line in everything, has determination, has methods, cadres take the lead, and work hard. This attitude towards the Party's revolutionary cause is precisely what we need in the current struggle to build a new socialist countryside. The experience of the Shou Zhang County Committee is ordinary. It is the truth that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly put forward, but there are not many leadership methods like the Shou Zhang County Committee in our province. The several experiences of the Shou Zhang County Committee can be achieved by the leadership organs and leading comrades of all counties. The Provincial Party Committee hopes that all counties in the province will seriously study it as a reference for improving leadership in the rectification movement."
　　In order to enable more people to study and learn from the leadership work methods of the Shou Zhang County Committee, we have specially excerpted and reprinted this article as follows.
　　Shou Zhang is located in the western plain of Shandong Province, with the Yellow River flowing through the county for more than one hundred miles. The county has a population of more than 71,000 households and more than 310,000 people. The cultivated land is more than 820,000 mu. Due to the harm of the Yellow River and serious sandy waste land, coupled with extensive farming in some areas, the output is very low. During the period of reactionary rule and during the war, the Yellow River caused great harm, disasters occurred year after year, the people's lives were impoverished, and they relied on relief every year. It was a grain-deficient county.
　　However, the people of Shou Zhang are not willing to be poor. With the leadership of the Party, the people have the courage to overcome disasters and change poverty, and poverty will become the driving force for progress. The masses actively fought against water disasters and sandy wasteland, which increased grain production year by year. Agricultural production has increased repeatedly. In 1953, the average yield per mu of grain was 146 jin, which increased to 182 jin in 1954, and then increased to 227 jin in 1955, an annual increase of more than 24%. In 1956, when agricultural cooperation was realized, agricultural production experienced an astonishing leap forward. The average yield per mu of grain was 341 jin, an increase of 49.8% compared with 1955, and the average actual grain income per person was 620 jin, and the average total income per person was 67 yuan (including grain), exceeding the level of local wealthy middle peasants. At the same time, Shou Zhang County also relied on cooperatives to carry out a mass pig-raising campaign. In August 1955, there were only 8,000 pigs raised in Shou Zhang County, an average of one pig for every nine households. By mid-November 1957, the county had raised more than 200,000 pigs, an average of nearly three pigs per household, an increase of twenty-four times in two years. On the basis of developing production, people's lives began to become prosperous. The Shou Zhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China developed production with revolutionary spirit and changed the face of poverty. This is an example worthy of emulation and one of the glorious examples in the province.
　　Truly Put Ideological Work First
　　The Shou Zhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has truly put ideological work first. This is first reflected in the fact that the County Committee seriously and conscientiously studies and understands the spirit of the Party's instructions, analyzes specific situations and the demands of the masses, so that the spirit of the Party's instructions is combined with the actual conditions of the county. After the upsurge of cooperation in the winter of 1955, the county committee analyzed the situation in the county: sandy wasteland and red silt land accounted for more than half, the soil was poor, well-digging was very difficult, and even if there was water, it could not be used. And the demand of the masses is to first improve the soil, turning over silt to cover sand, and turning over sand to cover silt, deep plowing five or six feet deep, to turn the land into "golden land", so that increased production would be guaranteed. According to the experience of the masses, the county committee made up its mind to focus on plowing, mobilizing the masses to plow 130,000 mu in one winter. With this item alone, more than 20 million jin of grain was increased in 1956.
　　In the unwavering implementation of the Party's instructions and resolutions, debates on two roads were constantly conducted. The county committee always adhered to the spirit of presenting facts and reasoning, using socialist ideology to defeat capitalist ideology, and using an active spirit of creation to defeat right-leaning conservative ideology. In the spring of 1955, more than 1,000 primary cooperatives were developed in the county, with nearly 50% of peasant households joining the cooperatives. At this time, a dispute arose. Some said it was "rash advance" and advocated resolutely shrinking; others said that the cooperatives were doing well and should be developed and consolidated. At the county committee meeting, led by Comrade Liu Chuanyou, secretary of the county committee, facts proved that the vast majority of primary cooperatives had increased production, the masses were satisfied, and the cadres were happy. Therefore, in that year, only six of the more than 1,000 cooperatives in the county were "contracted", and a large number of cooperatives were not blindly cut down. This year, the county committee also found that some cadres believed that "after the land reform, the poor peasants turned over, the countryside became dominated by middle peasants, and there were no poor peasants to rely on." The county committee conducted a survey of three townships. Among the 926 members of 45 cooperatives, there were 258 poor peasants, accounting for more than 27%, plus new and old lower-middle peasants, totaling about 70% of the total number of members. The county committee used this fact to powerfully convince the cadres, so that they realized that it is necessary to firmly implement the Party's class line in the countryside of relying on the poor peasants and firmly uniting with the middle peasants. After rectification, the leadership of the county's cooperatives was mainly in the hands of poor and lower-middle peasants.
　　In the spring of 1956, after the upsurge of cooperation, the county committee found that many cadres believed that with cooperation, everything would be easy to handle, so they developed styles such as spreading out and coercion and command. Some cadres also developed capitalist ideas such as taking advantage of and not participating in labor. And some masses also doubted whether cooperation was superior. These ideas and styles affected the development of production and the consolidation of cooperatives. According to the central government's instructions on running cooperatives diligently and democratically, the county committee conducted universal education within the Party in response to these ideological problems, and trained more than 2,000 cadres above the branch committee level, and then educated the county's Party members. As a result, the style of cadres was changed, the ideology of Party members was improved, and the emotions of the masses were stabilized. Therefore, after the autumn of 1956, the "typhoon" against cooperation did not blow up. The winter production upsurge was a vigorous success.
　The County Committee attaches great importance to the normalization of ideological work. Every time a work meeting is held, it always first investigates and studies the ideological trends of cadres and the masses, and solves ideological problems. In the past few years, the Party class system of grassroots Party organizations has been adhered to. Each township general branch has a secretary or deputy secretary in charge of ideological work, with two to three branch instructors, and team branches have instructors. Party classes are held twice a month in spring and winter, and once a month in summer and autumn. The content of Party classes includes basic Party knowledge, policy tasks, political current events, etc., and is coordinated with current work for education. The county's propaganda network has been universally adhered to, with networks in cooperatives and groups in teams, with more than 15,000 propagandists. Their consistent practice is: political and ideological work is carried out in production movements and various practical tasks; the ideological work of the branch must go deep into households, cadres go deep into the production process, work with members, and solve ideological problems in labor. For common ideological problems, the masses are mobilized to debate universally to seek solutions. Adhering to these practices, the ideological work of the upper and lower levels can be normalized.
　　With a Plan, the Entire Party Can Be Mobilized
　　The Shou Zhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China regards the correct formulation and resolute implementation of a comprehensive plan as a basic link in organizing and guiding socialist collective production, and as an important measure to mobilize the entire Party and mobilize the masses to build a better life.
　　Every time a plan is formulated, the county committee conducts typical investigations in advance (at least three typical materials), and the indicators are proposed based on needs and possibilities, so that they are advanced and reliable, and take into account the interests of all three parties. When formulating the land-turning plan in the winter of 1955, the county committee investigated the land that should be deeply plowed in the county (more than 430,000 mu), the time for land-turning in winter (100 to 120 days), the number of workdays required per mu of land (an average of 25 workdays), and the labor force that could participate in land-turning (30,000 to 40,000 people), and then according to the needs of increasing production in 1956, proposed the target of turning over 100,000 mu of land. The methods of formulating and implementing the plan have been universally discussed by cadres and the masses, so the process of formulating the plan has become a process of ideological mobilization, turning the plan into practical actions of cadres and the masses.
　　In the process of implementing the plan, the Shou Zhang County Committee also paid attention to discovering new problems in a timely manner and solving them in a timely manner. In the spring of 1957, when the county's pig-raising reached 100,000 heads, a pig epidemic occurred, and the summer wheat suffered from disaster and reduced production. Individual leading cadres of the county committee wavered on completing the plan of raising 180,000 heads of pigs, and the confidence of cadres and the masses was not high. Until August, there were only 80,000 pigs. After the county committee noticed it, it re-investigated the bottom of grain production in 1956 and the bottom of grain actually obtained by members in Taiqian and other cooperatives, proving that the basis for formulating the pig-raising plan was completely reliable. Although the county suffered from disaster and reduced production, the actual grain obtained per person could still reach about 500 jin, and the masses had the strength to complete the pig-raising plan. The problem lay in the leadership. The county committee settled this account clearly at the cadres' meeting, carried out criticism and self-criticism, overcame the wavering emotions of some leading cadres, and everyone's confidence doubled. Some effective measures were taken in a timely manner, so the number of pigs increased rapidly, and by November, the annual pig-raising plan was overfulfilled.

　　With a Typical Example, the Masses Can Be Persuaded
　　The Shou Zhang County Committee also attaches great importance to cultivating typical examples, summarizing the creations of the masses, and promoting comprehensive work. The methods of the county committee to lead agricultural production all come from the masses and return to the masses. In the winter of 1951, the county committee discovered the typical example of Zhang Jing'an (a single farmer), a labor model in Dongzhuang, Jiahe District, who turned over silt to cover sand and transformed sandy wasteland for a large increase in production (from 40 or 50 jin per mu to more than 300 jin), and realized that starting from improving the soil and transforming natural conditions could gradually change the county's poverty. However, when promoting Zhang Jing'an's land-turning experience, the masses reflected that "the method is good, but there is no strength!" Because deep plowing (about five feet deep) one mu of land requires 20 to 30 workdays. The small-scale peasant economy and individual production make it very difficult to develop agricultural production. This gave the county committee another inspiration: according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, developing mutual aid and cooperation and liberating rural productive forces can fundamentally solve this difficulty. In 1952, the county committee established a primary cooperative in Jingyanggang (where Wu Song fought the tiger), proving that there is great strength in organizing. Therefore, the county committee widely publicized and vigorously promoted it with a "model" of turning over land to increase production in one hand and a "model" of cooperatives having strength in the other, educating and persuading the masses. Mutual aid and cooperation have greatly developed, the number of land-turning has continued to increase, and it has promoted the small leap forward in grain production in 1954 and 1955. But to further increase production, it is necessary to increase fertilizer; and the peasants of Shou Zhang have never had the habit of raising pigs to accumulate manure. In the winter of 1954, the county committee summarized and disseminated the experience of Men Zhaoshan of Gaomiao Village, Zhaosheng Bai Township, who mobilized his family to raise pigs by calculating the details, the experience of Fan Xianzhang Primary Cooperative in Cui Dafeng Township in solving pig feed, and the experience of Chen Hanyun Primary Cooperative in Chengpo Township in raising pigs to accumulate manure and high output, breaking the conservative and fearful emotions that the masses have no habit and cannot raise pigs. After that, the county committee promptly came up with "models" in feeding management, using coarse feed instead of fine feed to fatten pigs, educating the masses to adopt and promote. The county committee has two fixed base-point cooperatives, with county committee members stationed in the cooperatives for a long time to create various experiences, and three deputy-point cooperatives of different types. Districts have base-point cooperatives, cooperatives have base-point teams, and each department has its own base-point cooperatives. It has truly achieved "each level has a base-point, and everything has a model." The county committee has disseminated 252 typical experiences in the past two years, most of which were discovered and summarized by the responsible comrades of the county committee themselves.

　　In terms of promoting typical experiences, the county committee has adopted a variety of methods. The meetings of the county committee to deploy work are all prepared with typical examples in advance and disseminated at the meetings. The examples of Zhang Jing'an turning over land to increase production and the typical examples of Yang Shengming Primary Cooperative in Jingyanggang in 1952 were all cases where the county committee sent responsible cadres to lead them to meetings in various places, with real people and real things, speaking from personal experience, and the effect was good. When launching a production upsurge in the winter of 1955 and promoting the experience of the Hongfeng Cooperative in Jiahe Township, Jiahe District in turning over silt to cover sand, the county committee convened a county-wide conference of district, township, and cooperative cadres in Jiahe Township, visited the site, learned on the spot, fully discussed, made a plan, and after the cadres returned, they led the masses to take immediate action. Therefore, the winter production upsurge quickly appeared, and the county turned over 130,000 mu of land.
　　Organize Strength into the Most Important Aspects
　　When carrying out each central task, the Shou Zhang County Committee paid attention to mobilizing the strength of all parties to serve it. The county committee made demands on all departments and made unified plans and unified arrangements, and unified inspections and summaries. After accepting work tasks, the departments also studied and formulated plans. This not only ensured the central work, but also carried out business work, and properly solved the contradiction between business work and central work.

　　Every time the county committee determined the central task, and made arrangements to the districts, townships (cooperatives), the secretary of the county committee and other responsible comrades immediately went deep into the districts, townships (cooperatives) to help discuss arrangements, and led the district and township cadres to earnestly implement the decisions of the county committee. The county committee organs often only left one secretary at home to grasp the work. One of the five secretaries was stationed in the district for a long time, and the other four were stationed in the district, township (cooperative) for at least four to six months of the year. Among the 27 members of the county committee, 21 often went down or were stationed in the base-point cooperative for a long time. As long as there are two main responsible cadres in many departments, one is left to manage daily work, and the other is to work at the grassroots level and in the cooperative. This is the case with the departments directly under the county committee, and the same is true for the departments directly under the county people's committee. Of the more than 100 cadres in the county committee organs, only more than 30 often insisted on working at home. Half of the cadres in the county people's committee organs often went down to work. Responsible cadres such as the deputy county head, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, the deputy director of the Grain Bureau, the president of the court, the deputy director of the bank, and the manager of the department store all worked in the district, township (cooperative) for a long time and engaged in base-point work. In this way, the leadership over grassroots work has been effectively strengthened.

　　For comrades who go to the grassroots level to help with their work, the county committee emphasized that they should rely on the Party branch to carry out their work, act as "advisers" instead of "commanders," avoid taking over and doing everything, in order to cultivate the independent working ability of grassroots cadres. The leadership composition of the Shou Zhang grassroots Party organization is pure, which is of great significance for firmly completing the socialist transformation of agriculture and socialist construction tasks, and implementing the Party's class line in the countryside. After the advanced cooperation in the winter of 1955, the Party branch guaranteed the absolute leadership over the cooperative, and there was no phenomenon of "replacing the Party with the cooperative." Among the 88 township branches in the county, 82 were united and able to excellently complete the tasks of the Party. The county committee has always insisted on the political education of Party members, often using communist ideology to educate Party members to be selfless and wholeheartedly serve the people. Individual Party members who violated laws and disciplines were dealt with in a timely and serious manner; at the same time, model Party members were evaluated and rewarded every year. Therefore, Party members throughout the county were full of high political enthusiasm, actively responded to the Party's call, and were able to unite the masses with their own exemplary actions and stand at the forefront in the struggle to develop agricultural production.

　　Secretaries Take the Lead, Cadres Take the Lead, Set an Example, Work Hard
　　On many important issues, the Shou Zhang County Committee took the lead personally. In the spring of 1957, when the pig epidemic was prevalent and threatened the interests of the masses, the county committee convened an emergency meeting of county, district, and township (cooperative) cadres, and called for "secretaries to go deep into pig farms" and "wherever things are tight, the secretary should go." After the meeting, Comrade Liu Chuanyou, secretary of the county committee, personally went deep into the pig farms and studied methods to stop the spread of the pig epidemic with veteran breeders. He found that poor feeding management was the main cause of the pig epidemic, and found many simple and effective methods to cure pig diseases from "local masters," which played a major role in stopping the spread of the pig epidemic. Every year during the flood season of the Yellow River, the county committee organs only left a few cadres to grasp the situation, and the vast majority of cadres led by Comrade Liu Chuanyou went to the dike and stayed on the dike all night with the masses. During production and disaster relief, cadres ate and lived with the victims and led the victims to produce for self-rescue. Comrade Liu Chuanyou was fixed in the first team of Taiqian Commune for a long time to participate in labor and guide production. Every time he went to the countryside, he would always talk to old farmers and had many close farmer friends. Whenever there was a difficulty, he would go to the masses to ask for advice and learn, and find a way to overcome the difficulty. It is with this diligent and dedicated communist spirit of serving the people that they are inspiring the cadres, Party members, and masses of the county. This socialist enthusiasm combined with reality and the masses has become a huge material force, and this force will be endless in the struggle to build a new socialist countryside.

　　These ordinary and valuable experiences of the Shou Zhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China have played a huge role in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture and the socialist construction of the countryside. They are continuing to use these experiences and rely on this force to lead the people of the county to a new peak of agricultural production increase. They are full of confidence in building Shou Zhang into a prosperous and wealthy, well-fed and well-clothed happy paradise.

　　平凡的经验　巨大的力量
　　——中共寿张县委领导工作中的几点主要经验介绍
　　陈晓东　吴飞  汪承彬
    编者按：这篇文章原载山东大众日报，在发表这篇文章的时候，中共山东省委写了一段按语，按语中说：
      “寿张县最近几年来的工作所以做得比较好些，主要是县委忠诚地研究与坚定地贯彻执行了党的指示，能够把党的指示精神与本县的具体情况和群众要求密切地结合起来；在重大的问题上，都是书记亲自动手，事事走群众路线，有决心，有办法，干部带头，艰苦奋斗。这种对待党的革命事业的态度，正是我们当前建设社会主义新农村的斗争中所必需的。寿张县委的经验是平凡的，它是党中央和毛主席所一再提出过的真理，可是在我省像寿张县委领导工作的方法，还不是很多的。寿张县委的几点经验，是各县的领导机关和领导同志都能够做到的。省委希望全省各县认真加以研究，作为整风中改进领导的参考。”
    为了使更多的人研究和学习寿张县委的领导工作方法，我们特将这篇文章摘要转载如下。
    寿张，位于山东省西部平原，黄河流经县境百余华里。全县居民七万一千余户，三十一万余人。耕地八十二万余亩，由于黄河为害，沙荒严重，再加部分地区耕作粗放，产量甚低。在反动统治时期和战争期间，黄河为害甚大，灾荒连年，人民生活贫困，年年靠救济，是个缺粮县。
    但是，寿张人民并不甘心贫困。有了党的领导，人民就有了战胜灾害、改变贫穷的勇气，贫困就会变成前进的动力。群众积极地向水害和沙荒作斗争，使粮食产量逐年提高。农业一再增产，1953年平均亩产粮食一百四十六斤，1954年就提高到一百八十二斤，1955年又提高到二百二十七斤，每年递增24％以上。在实现农业合作化的1956年，农业生产更发生了惊人的大跃进，平均亩产粮食三百四十一斤，比1955年增产49.8％，每人平均实得粮食六百二十斤，总收入每人平均六十七元（粮食在内），超过了当地富裕中农的水平。同时，寿张县还依靠合作社，开展了群众性的养猪运动。1955年8月，寿张全县养猪不过八千头，平均九户一头。到1957年11月中旬，全县养猪达到二十万多头，平均每户将近三头，两年增加了二十四倍。在发展生产的基础上，人民生活开始富裕起来。中共寿张县委以革命精神发展生产，改变穷困面貌，这是一个值得效法的榜样，是全省的光辉范例之一。
    真正把思想工作放在第一位
    中共寿张县委真正做到了把思想工作放在第一位。这首先表现在县委严肃认真地研究领会党的指示的精神，分析具体情况和群众的要求，使党的指示精神与本县的实际情况相结合。1955年冬合作化高潮后，县委就分析了全县的情况：沙荒地红淤地占一半多，土质坏，打井很困难，有水也用不上。而群众的要求是首先改良土壤，翻淤盖沙、翻沙盖淤，深翻五、六尺，变成“蒙金地”，增产就有把握。县委根据群众经验，下定决心，重点抓翻地，发动群众一冬翻地十三万亩。仅此一项，1956年就增产粮食二千余万斤。
    在坚定不移地贯彻执行党的指示、决议中，不断地进行了两条道路的辩论。县委始终坚持摆事实、讲道理的精神，以社会主义思想战胜资本主义思想，以积极创造精神，战胜右倾保守思想。1955年春，全县初级合作社发展到一千多个，入社农户近50％。这时发生了争论，有的说“冒进”了，主张坚决收缩；有的说合作社办得好，应当发展巩固。在县委会议上，以县委书记刘传友同志为首，用事实证明了绝大部分初级社增了产，群众满意，干部高兴，好得很。因此，在那一年，全县一千多个合作社，只“收缩”了六处，没有盲目地砍掉大量合作社。这年，县委还发现有些干部认为，“土地改革后贫农翻了身，农村中农化了，没有贫农可依靠了”。县委进行了三个乡的调查，在四十五个社九百二十六户社员中，贫农就有二百五十八户，占27％以上，加上新、老下中农，合计占社员总数的70％左右。县委用这个事实有力地说服了干部，使他们认识到，必须坚定地贯彻依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农这条党在农村的阶级路线。此后经过整顿，全县合作社的领导主要掌握在贫农和下中农手里。
    在合作化高潮后的1956年春，县委又发现不少干部认为合作化了，一切事情都好办了，因而滋长了铺大摊子和强迫命令等作风。部分干部沾光取巧得便宜，不参加劳动等资本主义思想也在滋长。而有些群众对合作化是否优越也在怀疑。这些思想、作风，影响生产的发展和合作社的巩固。县委根据中央关于勤俭办社和民主办社的指示精神，针对这些思想问题，在党内普遍地进行了教育，训练了支部委员以上的干部两千余人，进而教育了全县党员。结果，干部作风有转变，党员思想有提高，群众情绪也稳定了。因此，1956年的秋后，反对合作化的“台风”就没有刮得起来。冬季生产高潮就搞得轰轰烈烈。
  县委十分重视思想工作经常化。每次开工作会议，总是先调查研究干部、群众的思想动态，解决思想问题。几年来，基层党组织的党课制度一直坚持着，每一个乡总支有一个书记或副书记专管思想工作，有支部教员二至三人，队支部有辅导员。春、冬两季每月上党课两次，夏、秋两季每月一次。党课内容有党的基础知识、政策任务、政治时事等，作到了配合当前工作进行教育。全县宣传网普遍坚持着，社里有网，队里有组，有宣传员一万五千多名。他们一贯坚持的作法是：政治思想工作在生产运动和各项实际工作中去进行；支部的思想工作要深入到户，干部深入生产过程，与社员一起劳动，在劳动中解决思想问题。对于普遍性的思想问题，则发动群众普遍辩论，求得解决。坚持这些作法，上下的思想工作就可以经常化起来。
　　有了规划就能动员全党
    中共寿张县委把正确制订和坚决实现全面规划，看成是组织与指导社会主义集体生产的基本环节，看成是动员全党、动员群众建设美好生活的重要措施。
    每次制订规划，县委都事先进行典型调查（至少有三个典型材料），指标的提出是根据需要与可能，做到既先进又可靠，兼顾三方面的利益。1955年冬制订翻地规划时，就是调查了全县应深翻的土地（四十三万余亩），冬季翻地的时间（一百到一百二十天），每亩地所需工数（平均二十五个工），可能参加翻地的劳动力（三万到四万人），然后根据1956年增产的需要，提出翻地十万亩的指标。1957年初制订全年养猪规划时，先摸清了1956年粮食产量和社员实得粮食（平均每人六百二十斤）的底，研究了粗饲料的来源，加上对养猪典型社、户的调查，才确定每户养猪两头半，全县养猪十八万头。制订规划和实现规划的办法，都经过干部和群众普遍讨论，因而制定规划的过程，也就变成了思想动员，变规划为干部、群众实际行动的过程。
    在实现规划的过程中，寿张县委还注意了及时发现新问题，并及时加以解决。1957年春季，全县养猪达到十万头时，发生了猪疫，夏季小麦受灾减产，县委个别领导干部对完成养猪十八万头的规划发生动摇，干部、群众的信心也不高。直到8月，毛猪只有八万头。县委察觉后，又在台前等合作社重新调查了1956年粮食产量的底和社员实得粮食的底，证明制订养猪规划的根据完全可靠，虽然全县受灾减产，每人实得粮食仍然可以达到五百斤左右，群众有力量完成养猪规划，问题在于领导。县委在干部大会上算清了这笔大账，开展了批评与自我批评，克服了某些领导干部的动摇情绪，大家信心倍增，及时采取了一些有力的措施，因而养猪数字迅速增长，到11月，就超额完成了全年养猪规划。
　　有了典型就能说服群众
    寿张县委还非常重视培养典型，总结群众创造，推动全面的工作。县委领导农业生产的办法，都是从群众中来又回到群众中去。1951年冬，县委发现了夹河区董庄劳动模范张景安（单干户）翻淤盖沙、改造沙荒地大增产（由亩产四、五十斤增至三百斤以上）的典型事例，认识到从改良土壤着手，改造自然条件，就可以逐步改变全县的贫困面貌。但是，在推广张景安翻地经验的时候，群众反映说：“办法好是好，就是没力量！”因为深翻（五尺上下）一亩地，要用二、三十个工。小农经济、个体生产，给发展农业生产以很大困难。这又给了县委一个启示：要根据党中央和毛主席的指示，发展互助合作，解放农村生产力，就可以从根本上解决这个困难。1952年，县委就在景阳岗（武松打虎处）成立了一处初级合作社，证明组织起来力量大，翻地有办法。于是，县委一手拿着翻地增产的“样子”，一手拿着合作社有力量的“样子”，广泛宣传，大力推广，教育说服了群众。互助合作有了很大发展，翻地数目不断增多，促进了1954年和1955年粮食增产的小跃进。但要进一步增产，就得增施肥料；而寿张农民从来没有养猪积肥的习惯。1954年冬，县委就总结传播了赵升白乡高庙村门兆山用算细账的办法动员全家养猪的经验，崔大风乡范宪章初级社解决养猪饲料的经验，和城坡乡陈汉云初级社养猪积肥产量高的经验，打破了认为群众没习惯就不能养猪的保守畏难情绪以后，县委又在饲养管理、以粗代细喂肥猪等方面，及时地拿出“样子”，教育群众采用推广。县委有两个固定的基点社，由县委委员长期驻社，创造各种经验，并有三个不同类型的副点社。区有基点社，社有基点队，各部门又有自己的基点社。真正做到了“层层有基点，事事有样子”。县委两年来传播了二百五十二个典型经验，多数是县委负责同志亲自发现总结的。
    在推广典型经验方面，县委采用了多种多样的办法。县委每次部署工作的会议，都是事先准备好典型，在会上传播。1952年传播张景安翻地增产的事例和景阳岗杨升明初级社的典型，都是县委派负责干部带领他们到各地开会，真人真事，现身说法，效果良好。1955年冬发动生产高潮，推广夹河区夹河乡洪峰社翻淤盖沙经验时，县委就在夹河乡召开全县区、乡、社干部大会，现场参观，就地学习，充分讨论，作好规划，干部回去后就带领群众立即行动。因此，冬季生产高潮迅速出现，全县翻地十三万亩。
    把力量组织到最主要方面来
    在进行每一项中心工作时，寿张县委都注意调动各方面的力量，来为它服务。县委向各部门提出要求，并且作出统一的计划和统一安排，统一进行检查、总结。部门在接受工作任务之后，也都研究制订计划。这样做，既保证了中心工作，也开展了业务工作，妥善地解决了业务工作与中心工作的矛盾。
    县委每次确定了中心任务，向区、乡（社）作了部署以后，县委书记和其他负责同志，都是立即深入区、乡（社），帮助讨论布置，领导区乡干部切实贯彻执行县委的决定。县委机关常常只留一位书记在家掌握工作，五位书记中有一位副书记长期驻区，其余四位全年至少有四个月到六个月的时间驻在区、乡（社）。县委委员二十七人中，有二十一人经常下去或长期驻在基点社。许多部门只要有两个主要负责干部，都是留一人管理日常工作，另一人到基层、到合作社里工作。县委直属部门如此，县人民委员会直属部门也如此。县委机关百余干部，经常在家坚持工作的只有三十余人。县人委机关干部经常有一半下去工作。副县长、水利局长、粮食局副局长、法院院长、银行副行长、百货公司经理等负责干部，都长时间在区、乡（社）里工作，搞基点。这样，就切实加强了对基层工作的领导。
    对于到基层帮助工作的同志，县委强调要他们依靠党支部进行工作，当“参谋”，不当“司令”，避免包办代替，以培养基层干部的独立工作能力。寿张基层党组织的领导成份纯洁，这对于坚定地完成农业的社会主义改造和社会主义建设任务，贯彻党在农村的阶级路线，有重要的意义。1955年冬高级合作化后，党支部保证了对合作社的绝对领导，没有“以社代党”的现象。全县八十八个乡支部中，有八十二个团结一致，能够出色地完成党的任务。县委始终坚持对党员的政治教育，经常以共产主义思想教育党员要大公无私，全心全意地为人民服务。对个别违法乱纪的党员，及时地、严肃地加以处理；同时每年评选奖励模范党员。因此，全县党员充满着高涨的政治热情，积极响应党的号召，能够以自己的模范行动去团结群众，在发展农业生产的斗争中站在前列。
    书记动手　干部带头  以身作则　艰苦奋斗
    在许多重要问题上，寿张县委都是书记亲自动手。1957年春猪疫流行，威胁群众利益，县委召开县、区、乡（社）干部紧急会议时，就号召“书记要深入猪场”，“哪里吃紧，书记就到哪里”。会后，县委书记刘传友同志就亲自深入猪场，同老饲养员研究制止猪疫流行的办法，发现饲养管理不善，是猪疫流行的主要原因，又向“土师傅”找到许多治好猪病的简易有效的办法，对制止猪疫起了重大作用。每年黄河防汛时，县委机关只留守几个干部掌握情况，以刘传友同志为首的绝大多数干部上了堤，和群众一起彻夜坚守大堤。生产救灾时，干部与灾民同吃同住，领导灾民生产自救。刘传友同志长时间固定在台前社一队参加劳动，指导生产。他每次下乡，总要找老农民谈心，有许多农民知心朋友。一有困难，就到群众中去请教、学习，找到了克服困难的办法。他们就是以这种勤勤恳恳、全心全意为人民服务的共产主义精神，鼓舞着全县的干部、党员和群众。这种社会主义劲头与实际与群众相结合，就变成了一股巨大的物质力量，这个力量在建设社会主义新农村的斗争中将是无穷无尽的。
    中共寿张县委这些平凡而可贵的经验，在推进农业的社会主义改造和农村的社会主义建设事业中发挥了巨大的力量。他们正继续运用这些经验和依靠这种力量，带领全县人民奔向新的农业增产的高峰，他们满怀信心要把寿张建设成一个繁荣富裕、丰衣足食的幸福乐园。
