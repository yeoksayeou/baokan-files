    Here is a set of tea utensils. But these are not commodities from a store, but rather homemade toys for children. The tea tray is made from the lid of a large "Weirfu" box, the teacups are made of cardboard, the saucers are made from the lids of small "Baiquelin" boxes, and the thermos is made from a small glass bottle that once contained medicine and thin iron sheets. If children want to furnish a room for their dolls, it is best to guide them to make a set of tea utensils themselves.

    一套茶具
    这里摆着一套茶具。但这些不是商店里的商品，而是家庭自制的儿童玩具。这只茶盘是用大“维尔肤”盒盖做的，茶杯是用马粪纸做的，碟子是用小“百雀羚”盒盖做的，热水瓶是用一只装药水的小玻璃瓶和薄铁皮做成的。如果孩子们要为他们的洋娃娃布置房间的时候，最好指导他们亲自动手做一套茶具。
