The United Arab Republic

On February 1, Egyptian President Nasser and Syrian President Kuwatly signed a declaration of great significance at the Republic Palace in Cairo, announcing the establishment of the United Arab Republic jointly composed of Egypt and Syria. According to the results of the referendums held in Egypt and Syria on the 21st, the vast majority of voters in the two countries supported the union of Egypt and Syria and elected Nasser as President of the United Arab Republic.

Egypt and Syria are both Arab countries. Egypt is located in northeastern Africa, straddling Asia and Africa, with an area of ​​more than 990,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 24 million. 90% of the people believe in Islam, and more than 90% are Arabs. Syria is located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of ​​more than 187,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 3.9 million. 85% believe in Islam. The residents are mainly Arabs.

Egypt and Syria are not only of the same Arab ethnicity, with a common language and customs, but also share a common history. They and all Arab nations were originally a unified whole, but from the 16th century they were conquered by the Turks and incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. After World War I, when they broke free from Turkish oppression, Western colonialists adopted a divide-and-rule approach and continued to carry out colonial rule over Arab countries.

However, the heroic people of the Arab countries have never stopped fighting. After the October Socialist Revolution, the movement of the people of these countries to strive for national liberation entered a new stage. Especially after the Second World War, their struggle for national independence has gained new momentum and achieved great victories. In April 1946, the Syrian people forced the British and French troops to withdraw from Syria and achieved independence. Egypt also established an independent republic in 1953, and then completely broke free from the shackles of British colonial rule.

The people of independent Egypt and Syria are closely united in the struggle against imperialist aggression, safeguarding the independence of the Arab nation, and defending peace in the Middle East. Especially in recent years, the people of the two countries have successively experienced the great storms of opposition to the aggression by US, British and French imperialism, but their joint struggle has withstood severe tests and achieved brilliant victories. In 1956, when Egypt suffered a severe crisis from the military aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, Syria immediately severed diplomatic relations with the British and French aggressors, cut off the oil pipelines of the aggressor countries in Syria, and fully supported the just anti-aggression war of the Egyptian people in actual actions. When the United States carried out subversion and prepared to launch a war of aggression against Syria in 1957, the Egyptian people firmly stood on the side of Syria and loudly shouted "to live and die with Syria." Egypt also sent troops to aid Syria. The struggle of the people of Egypt and Syria to unite and defend national independence, with the strong support of the people of all countries, has caused the imperialist conspiracies of aggression to go bankrupt one after another in the Middle East.

What the United States and other imperialists fear most is the unity of the Arab nation. Therefore, they are doing their best to carry out divisive activities, attempting to isolate Egypt and Syria in order to achieve the goal of defeating them one by one. However, the unity of Egypt and Syria is developing and consolidating day by day. As early as October 20, 1955, they signed a joint defense treaty and established a joint command of the armed forces of the two countries. The treaty stipulates that "both parties guarantee that if one country is invaded, the other country will immediately provide assistance." This treaty has fully played its role in resisting the aggression of British, French and American imperialism.

Egypt and Syria have favorable conditions for developing and prospering their national economies. They both produce large quantities of cotton. The quality of Egyptian long-staple cotton is the best in the world, and its output accounts for 60%-65% of the world's total long-staple cotton output. Egypt also has many important mineral deposits. Syria is rich in wheat. Due to long-term plunder by imperialism, the economies of Egypt and Syria are very backward, and Syria's industrial base is even weaker. In recent years, British, French, and American imperialism have carried out economic aggression against them, refusing to grant unconditional loans, attacking their cotton and wheat exports, etc., in an attempt to force them to submit economically. However, Egypt and Syria adhere to the policy of equal and mutually beneficial international economic cooperation, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, they have thwarted the economic aggression attempts of British, French and American imperialism.

The military alliance and economic cooperation between the people of Egypt and Syria in the struggle to safeguard national independence and develop their national economies have laid a solid foundation for the establishment of the United Arab Republic.

### 阿拉伯联合共和国

    阿拉伯联合共和国
    2月1日，埃及总统纳赛尔和叙利亚总统库阿特利在开罗共和宫签署了一项具有重大意义的宣言，宣布成立由埃及和叙利亚联合组成的阿拉伯联合共和国。根据埃及和叙利亚在21日举行公民投票的结果，两国绝大多数选民都拥护埃及和叙利亚联合，并且选举纳赛尔为阿拉伯联合共和国总统。
    埃及和叙利亚都是阿拉伯国家。埃及位于非洲东北部，地跨亚非两洲，面积九十九万多平方公里，人口约二千四百多万，90％的人信仰伊斯兰教，90％以上是阿拉伯人。叙利亚位于地中海东岸，面积十八万七千多平方公里，人口约三百九十多万，85％信奉伊斯兰教。居民主要是阿拉伯人。
    埃及和叙利亚不仅同是阿拉伯民族，有着共同的语言和风俗习惯，而且还有着共同的历史。它们同所有阿拉伯民族原是统一体，但从十六世纪开始就被土耳其人征服，并被并入奥斯曼帝国的版图。第一次世界大战以后，当它们从土耳其的压迫下摆脱出来的时候，西方殖民主义者采取了分而治之的手段，继续对阿拉伯国家进行殖民统治。
    但是，英勇的阿拉伯国家人民一天也没有停止过斗争。十月社会主义革命后，这些国家人民争取民族解放的运动进入了一个新的阶段。特别是第二次世界大战后，他们争取民族独立的斗争有了新的高涨，取得了巨大的胜利。1946年4月，叙利亚人民迫使英法军撤出了叙利亚，取得了独立。埃及也在1953年成立了独立的共和国，接着完全挣脱了英国殖民统治的枷锁。
    独立了的埃及和叙利亚两国人民，在反对帝国主义侵略、维护阿拉伯民族独立和保卫中东和平的斗争中，休戚相关，紧密团结。特别是在最近几年间，两国人民先后经历了反对美、英、法帝国主义侵略的巨大风浪，但他们的联合斗争经受住了严重的考验，取得了光辉的胜利。1956年，当埃及遭受英法和以色列军事侵略的严重关头，叙利亚立即断绝了与英法侵略者的外交关系，切断了侵略国家在叙利亚的输油管，在实际行动中全力支持了埃及人民的正义的反侵略战争。而当美国在1957年对叙利亚进行颠复和准备发动侵略战争的时候，埃及人民也坚决地站在叙利亚一边，响亮地高呼“要同叙利亚共存亡”，埃及还派遣军队驰援叙利亚。埃、叙两国人民团结一致捍卫民族独立的斗争，在各国人民的有力支持下，使帝国主义的侵略阴谋在中东一个接着一个地破产了。
    美国和其他帝国主义最害怕的，是阿拉伯民族的团结。因此，它们竭力进行分化活动，企图孤立埃及和叙利亚，达到各个击破的目的。但是，埃及和叙利亚的团结，日益发展和巩固。它们早在1955年10月20日就签订了共同防御条约，建立了两国武装部队的联合司令部，条约规定“双方保证在任何一国被侵略时，另一国立即予以援助”。这个条约已在反抗美英法帝国主义侵略时期，充分发挥了它的作用。
    埃及和叙利亚具有发展和繁荣国民经济的有利条件。它们都出产大量的棉花。埃及的长纤维棉花的质量是世界第一，产量占世界长纤维棉花总产量的60％—65％。埃及还有许多重要矿藏。叙利亚则盛产小麦。由于长期受到帝国主义的掠夺，埃叙两国经济都很落后，叙利亚的工业基础更为薄弱。这几年来，美英法帝国主义对它们进行经济侵略，拒绝给予不附条件的贷款，打击它们的棉花和小麦出口等等，企图在经济上迫使它们屈服。但埃及和叙利亚坚持实行平等互利的国际经济合作政策，在苏联的无私援助下，挫败了美英法帝国主义的经济侵略企图。
    埃、叙两国人民在维护民族独立和发展国民经济的斗争中的军事联盟和经济合作，奠立了建立阿拉伯联合共和国的坚固基础。
