A New Situation Unfolds
Bai Sheng

After the anti-rightist struggle and rectification in various colleges and universities, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff has rapidly increased. Under the situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction, many schools have implemented the principles of diligence and frugality in running schools, diligence and frugality in production, and combining work and study. They have achieved the goals of sending cadres to lower levels for labor training, opening the school gates, establishing close ties with their neighbors, and sending Party committee cadres and teaching staff to work in departments and faculties. "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" have brought a completely new atmosphere everywhere.

The "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" in colleges and universities are important methods for reforming higher education and running socialist universities well. The significance of this approach lies in thoroughly breaking away from the bourgeois teaching ideology and policies that have long influenced our colleges and universities, namely, the separation of theory from practice, teaching from production, mental labor from physical labor, and professional work from politics. It also thoroughly breaks away from the bad bourgeois ideas and work styles of extravagance and waste, and emphasizing ostentation. It has created a new situation of great leap forward for colleges and universities.

The masses' awareness has been raised, and innovative approaches have been put forward. Does this mean that there are no longer any ideological problems in some educational departments and school leaderships? No, it does not.

Some people understand "Three Diligences" purely from an economic point of view. They believe that doing so is only to solve the current economic difficulties of the state and individuals, and only to save some money, without seeing the important significance of "Three Diligences" in teaching reform. Because doing so will completely change our bourgeois educational methods and enable us to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist consciousness who combine theory with practice, and red experts who are both red and expert.

Some people are also afraid that implementing the "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" will affect the quality of teaching and scientific research work, and affect the Party's leadership of political work. What is the reality? "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" are precisely for the purpose of combining teaching with production, theory with practice, and education with politics. Doing so will only better improve the quality of teaching and scientific research work.

Some people also believe that implementing "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" will affect the running of regular colleges and universities. Socialist colleges and universities should implement the policy of combining education with production. Only by implementing "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" can teaching be combined with production, mental labor with physical labor, and theory with practice. "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" are precisely the methods of running schools that we need. They are by no means temporary measures. We must not measure them with bourgeois ideas of running schools, or regard new things with bourgeois "regular" eyes.

The new atmosphere of "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" has emerged on the basis of the broad masses of teachers, students, and staff raising their socialist consciousness through extensive airing of views, great debates, and great contending. Now the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, a new situation and new atmosphere in education have unfolded, and new people have emerged. What is the responsibility of educational departments and school leaders? It is to consolidate and promote the enthusiasm of the masses for "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings," boldly mobilize the masses, firmly believe in and rely on the masses, and gradually make "Three Diligences" and "Three Openings" an important working method of colleges and universities, and constantly enrich and replenish new content. We believe that if this is the case, China's higher education will have great prospects and can develop forward at a greater speed along the correct direction of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    新的局面展开了
    柏生
    各地高等学校经过反右派斗争和整改以后，广大师生员工社会主义觉悟迅速提高。在社会主义建设大跃进的形势下，许多学校贯彻了勤俭办学、勤俭生产、勤工俭学，做到下放干部劳动锻炼，开放学校大门，和左邻右舍密切联系，党委干部和教学人员下放班系工作。“三勤”“三放”，到处气象一新。
    高等学校“三勤”和“三放”，是革新高等教育，办好社会主义大学的重要办法。这种做法的意义，在于彻底打破了资产阶级长期影响在我们高等学校中的理论脱离实际，教学脱离生产，脑力劳动脱离体力劳动，业务脱离政治的教学思想和方针，也彻底打破了资产阶级铺张浪费，讲究排场的坏思想和坏作风。它给高等学校创造了大跃进的新形势。
    群众的觉悟提高了，革新的做法拿出来了。是不是在一些教育部门和学校领导方面是不是已经完全没有什么思想问题了呢？不是的。
    有些人只单纯从经济意义出发来理解“三勤”，他们认为这样做只是为了解决当前国家和个人的经济困难，只是节省一些钱，而没有看到“三勤”在教学改革方面的重要意义。因为这样做，会使我们完全改变了资产阶级的教育方法，能够培养理论结合实际，有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，又红又专的红色专家。
    还有些人怕贯彻“三勤”“三放”后会影响了教学和科学研究工作的质量，影响党领导政治工作。事实如何呢？“三勤”“三放”正是为了使教学结合生产，理论联系实际，教育结合政治。这样做只会更好地提高教学和科学研究工作的质量。
    还有些人认为贯彻了“三勤”“三放”会影响了办正规的高等学校。社会主义高等学校应当贯彻教育和生产相结合的方针，要实行了“三勤”和“三放”，才能使教学结合生产、脑力劳动结合体力劳动，理论联系实际。“三勤”和“三放”正是我们需要的办学的办法，决不是什么临时措施，我们决不能拿资产阶级的办学思想来衡量它，拿资产阶级的“正规”眼光来看待新鲜事物。
    “三勤”“三放”的新气象，是在广大师生员工通过大鸣大放，大争大辩，提高社会主义觉悟的基础上出现的。现在群众的情绪非常高涨，展开了教育事业的新局面，新气象，出现了新人物。教育部门和学校领导者的责任是什么呢？就是要巩固和发扬群众的“三勤”“三放”积极性，放手发动群众，坚决相信群众和依靠群众，逐步使“三勤”“三放”成为高等学校的重要的工作方法，并且不断丰富和充实新的内容。我们相信，如果这样，我国的高等教育事业会大有希望，就可以沿着多快好省的正确方向以更大的速度向前发展。
