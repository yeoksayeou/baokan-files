    Yunnan University Students Find Ways to Work-Study, Regardless of On or Off Campus, With or Without Pay

    (Our newspaper's Kunming dispatch) Students at Yunnan University are actively responding to the call for work-study programs and have launched various labor activities.

    After the Yunnan University Party Committee conveyed the policy of work-study in November of last year, the school's Communist Youth League and Student Union organized student seminars. In the seminars, university students were extremely enthusiastic and suggested many avenues for work-study programs. At that time, it was decided to conduct experiments in seven classes within the Chinese, Chemistry, and Agriculture departments, and then promote it throughout the university. After more than two months of experimentation, great achievements have been made. To date, 393 out of 465 students in the seven classes have participated in work-study activities.

    On campus, they organized activities such as cutting mimeograph stencils for the publishing section, cleaning books for the library, and cleaning classrooms, accumulating fertilizer, washing clothes, and knitting sweaters. The spare time labor of more than 100 students in the stencil cutting alone can replace more than 40 temporary workers. In addition to reducing a large amount of wage expenditure for the school, students can also receive a small amount of pay. After the students participated in cleaning the classrooms, the school reduced the staffing of five janitorial staff, saving the state more than 1,000 yuan in wage expenditures each year. In the past, the fertilizer for the school's experimental farm was transported by temporary workers hired from outside. After the students participated in fertilizer accumulation, the expenditure on temporary workers' wages was greatly reduced. They also organized many people to participate in the construction project of the teaching building, totaling more than 5,000 person-times. Off campus, students earned some income by moving books for Xinhua Bookstore. Four students also proofread galleys for the "Border Youth Daily," earning 50 cents per page proofread, with each person earning more than 3 yuan per month. The school also organized seven students to serve as teachers in the spare time school and Russian teachers at the Yunnan Iron Factory, reducing the factory's staffing, and the students also had income. In addition, the school also organized many voluntary labor activities. During the New Year, a "New Year Voluntary Labor Day" was organized with more than 1,600 participants. Many students also went to the park to help clean, help workers carry soil and move flowers, and helped the police maintain traffic order on the streets.

    After this period of work-study labor education, a thrifty atmosphere emerged in the school. Some students who participated in work-study labor received some wages. In addition to buying some daily necessities for their mothers and sending them home, they also proposed to the school that they no longer need to receive clothing subsidies. More than 100 students who participated in on-campus construction projects earned an average of more than 6 yuan in wages each. Some students voluntarily proposed not to receive student aid, and some students used their wages to buy reference books and daily necessities. Students have also undergone great changes in their thinking. Some said, "Participating in labor at school, exercising for one or two years, being both a worker and a university student, is really great!"

    Now the work-study movement at Yunnan University has become widespread throughout the school. The school's Party, Communist Youth League, and Student Union are summarizing their experiences in order to promote it throughout the school.

### 不分校内校外　不论有无报酬  云南大学学生找到勤工俭学门路

    不分校内校外　不论有无报酬
    云南大学学生找到勤工俭学门路
    本报昆明讯　云南大学学生积极响应勤工俭学号召，开展了各种各样的劳动活动。
    去年11月，中共云南大学党委会传达了勤工俭学的方针后，该校共青团和学生会就组织了学生座谈。在座谈中大学生们情绪极为高涨，提出了很多勤工俭学的门路。当时就确定先在中文系、化学系、农业系的七个班内作试验，然后再向全校推广。经过两个多月的试验，取得了很大成绩。到目前止，七个班的四百六十五个同学中，已有三百九十三人参加了勤工俭学的活动。
    在校内，他们组织了为出版科刻蜡板，为图书馆清理图书及打扫教室、积肥、洗衣服、打毛线衣等活动。仅刻蜡板一项，一百多个学生的业余劳动就可以代替四十多个临时工，学校除减少了大批工资的支出外，学生们也能得到稍许的报酬。学生们参加打扫教室的劳动后，学校减少了五个勤杂人员的编制，每年为国家节约一千多元的工资支出。过去，该校试验农场的肥料，都是从外边雇临时工来校挑送，学生们参加了积肥后，就大大的减少了临时工工资的支出。他们还组织了许多人参加教学大楼的修建工程，共达五千多人次。在校外，学生们为新华书店搬书，也得到一些收入。还有四个学生为“边疆青年报”校对清样，每校一版可得报酬五角，每人每月可得工资三元多。学校还组织了七个学生在云南铁工厂担任业余学校的教学及俄文教员，减少了铁工厂编制，学生们也有了收入。此外，学校还组织了很多义务劳动。新年时组织了一千六百多人的“新年义务劳动日”，不少学生还到公园帮助打扫清洁，帮工人挑土、搬花；在街上帮民警维持交通秩序。
    经过这一段勤工俭学的劳动教育后，学校出现了勤俭的风气。有的学生参加勤工俭学的劳动后，得到一些工资，除给母亲买了些日用品寄回家，还向学校提出不再领衣服补助。参加校内基建工程的一百多个学生，每人平均得工资六元多，有些学生就主动的提出不领助学金，有的学生把工资买了参考书和日用品。学生们在思想上也起了很大变化。有的说：“在校参加劳动，锻炼一二年，又是工人又是大学生，真好！”
    现在云南大学勤工俭学的运动已普及全校，该校党、团和学生会正在总结经验，以便在全校推广。
