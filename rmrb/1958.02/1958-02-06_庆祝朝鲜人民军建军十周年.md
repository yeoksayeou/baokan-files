　　Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
　　Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers　Yang Yong
    February 8th this year is the glorious festival of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Korean People's Army. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers extend warm congratulations to our closest comrades-in-arms!
    Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean People's Army has gone through ten glorious years and withstood various severe tests, becoming an invincible force.
    During the Korean War, the head of imperialism, the United States, was once frantically gathering troops from more than a dozen vassal states and using a large number of its own "elite" land, sea, and air forces, attempting to strangle the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea in one fell swoop, and then invade the People's Republic of China. However, with the support of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, and with the assistance of peace-loving people all over the world, under the heroic blows of the people's armies of both Korea and China, the invaders finally suffered a shameful defeat and were forced to retreat to the location where they launched the war—the 38th parallel. The victory of the Korean War proved that the power of the people is invincible; it proved that the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is inviolable; it proved that the world's peace and democratic forces are infinitely powerful. The victory of the Korean War was a severe blow to the imperialist warmongers and was a great encouragement to the peace-loving people of the world and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries oppressed by imperialism. The achievements made by the Korean people and their army in this regard are immortal in world history.
    After the armistice, the Korean Workers' Party and the government led the people to rebuild their peaceful and happy homes. The heroic Korean People's Army, on the one hand, persistently defended the northern edge of the demilitarized zone and the east and west coasts, monitored the enemy, and thwarted many enemy provocations, maintaining the armistice agreement and effectively guaranteeing the peaceful construction of the Korean people. On the other hand, the military and political training of the troops has also made great progress. During this period, the Korean People's Army also responded to Marshal Kim Il-sung's call to "immediately transform the heroic spirit of defeating the enemy in the anti-aggression war into restoration and construction," and entire regiments and battalions went to factories and mines to participate in construction. In particular, in 1955, 80,000 soldiers were demobilized and returned to their hometowns to engage in production, strengthening the strength of the production front and accelerating the recovery and development of the post-war economy. We, the Chinese People's Volunteers, are excited for our comrades-in-arms for the new brilliant achievements they have made in a short period of time!
    The Chinese People's Volunteers, whether in the war or in post-war construction, have received great encouragement and education from the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. We have been inseparable for several years, as close as flesh and blood. Our friendship is a fighting friendship forged with blood. From the day we entered Korea to fight, the people and armies of the two countries did not let differences in language or customs affect the exchange of friendship between us. The officers and soldiers of the Volunteers have a universal feeling that the elders of Korea love us as they love their own children; the comrades of the Korean People's Army care for us as they care for their own brothers. During the war, we and the Korean People's Army marched shoulder to shoulder through enemy fire; we marched together under the scorching sun, camped out in the cold night, and dined together in the tunnels; we supported each other in times of hardship and sang triumphant songs together in victory. We will always remember that the comrades of the Korean People's Army paid a bloody price in many battles to assist our offensive or cover our retreat; they spared no effort to save the wounded; they guarded us to give us adequate rest; and in order to solve the difficulties in our lives, they would rather endure hardships themselves and send us food and fuel. This great friendship encouraged us to complete various arduous combat missions. During the war, the Korean people also supported our army with unparalleled enthusiasm, building roads for our advancement, sending us water and food, transporting the wounded, letting us live in their houses, lending us furniture, and giving us comfort and encouragement many times. The touching deeds of martyrs like Park Jae-geun, who risked their lives to rescue our wounded, will never be forgotten by all our officers and soldiers; and famous models of supporting the army and the front lines, such as Ham Jae-bok, Gu Bu-ryeok, and Seok Gil-ryeong, are loved by all our officers and soldiers. After the war, we and the Korean People's Army not only jointly guarded the armistice line, but also joined the high tide of construction. Our friendship has developed and deepened even more. The Korean Party, government, army, and people send delegations to comfort us every major festival, giving us great encouragement, especially when we encounter danger, they always do their best to turn danger into safety. The support and care of the Korean people and the army for us constantly encourages our entire army.
    Over the past few years, the Chinese People's Volunteers have not only joined the Korean People's Army in crushing the attacks of the ferocious enemy and achieving victory in the war. After the war, we also actively assisted the Korean people in rebuilding their homeland. We have deep feelings for every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea. Our slogan of action is "Help build Korea as we build our motherland." During the war, we used the gaps between battles to build more than 15,000 houses for the Korean people; repaired more than 2,700 canals and embankments; and repaired more than 2,700 bridges. After the war, we helped the Korean people carry out large-scale construction work. At the beginning of last year, the leading organs of the Volunteers called on the entire army to use 300,000 man-days to help the Korean people with production and construction. This call was enthusiastically responded to by all officers and soldiers, and by the end of the year, more than 637,000 man-days were completed, more than double the original plan. All officers and soldiers of the Volunteers regard helping the Korean people with production and construction as their greatest glory. At the same time, we also provided disaster relief and medical treatment to the Korean people, sharing weal and woe; and conducted many friendly visits and mutual learning to enhance the friendship between Korea and China. The heroic and tenacious spirit of the Korean People's Army, its fearlessness of hardship, strict observance of discipline, and excellent style of regularization are worthy of our learning. The Korean people's fine qualities of diligence, bravery, and love for their country are deeply engraved in the hearts of the vast number of officers and soldiers. The friendship formed between the armies of Korea and China in the struggle against the common enemy can be said to be a model of the two armies fighting side by side and uniting closely.
    We, the Chinese People's Volunteers, cherish very much the fighting friendship between us and the Korean People's Army. We will continue to learn from the excellent style of the Korean People's Army; we will do our best to help the Korean people build a peaceful and happy life with our labor; we will always stand together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and strive to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people and armies of Korea and China! (Attached pictures)

　　庆祝朝鲜人民军建军十周年
　　中国人民志愿军司令员　杨勇
    今年2月8日，是英雄的朝鲜人民军建军十周年的光荣节日，中国人民志愿军的全体官兵向我们最亲密的战友，致以热烈的祝贺！
    朝鲜人民军在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，走过了十年的光荣的历程，经受了各种严重的考验，已成为一支不可战胜的力量。
    在朝鲜战争中，帝国主义的首脑美国，曾疯狂一时，纠合了十几个仆从国家的军队，并动用了自己大量的陆海空军“精锐”部队，妄图一举扼死年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，进而侵犯中华人民共和国。但在苏联和社会主义兄弟国家支持下，在全世界爱好和平人民的援助下，在朝中两国人民军队的英勇打击下，侵略者终于遭到可耻的失败，并被迫退回他们发动战争的地点——三八线。朝鲜战争的胜利，证明了人民的力量是不可战胜的；证明了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营是不可侵犯的；证明了世界和平民主力量是无限强大的。朝鲜战争的胜利对于帝国主义战争贩子是一个严重的打击。对于世界爱好和平的人民和受帝国主义压迫的殖民地半殖民地的人民，则是一个极大的鼓舞。朝鲜人民及其军队在这方面所建立的功绩，在世界历史上是永垂不朽的。
    停战后，朝鲜劳动党和政府领导着人民重建自己和平幸福的家园。英雄的朝鲜人民军，一方面坚持不懈地坚守非军事区北沿，坚守东西海岸，监视着敌人，粉碎了敌人许多次的挑衅，维护了停战协定，有力地保证了朝鲜人民的和平建设；另一方面，部队的军事政治训练也取得了很大成绩。在此期间，朝鲜人民军又响应了金日成元帅“把反侵略战争中战胜敌人的英雄气概，立即转到恢复建设中去”的号召，成团成营的部队到厂矿参加修建。特别是1955年有八万军人复员回乡生产，加强了生产战线的力量，加速了战后经济的恢复和发展。我们中国人民志愿军为我们的战友，在短短的时期内所取得的新的光辉成就而感到兴奋！
    中国人民志愿军，无论在战争中或是战后建设中，都从朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军那里得到很大的鼓舞和教益。几年来我们相处无间，亲同骨肉。我们的友谊是用鲜血凝结起来的战斗友谊。从我们入朝作战那天起，两国人民和军队并没有因言语不同，习惯不同而影响我们之间友情的交流。志愿军官兵有一个普遍的感觉，就是：朝鲜的父老，像热爱自己子弟似的热爱着我们；朝鲜人民军同志，像关怀自己兄弟似的关怀着我们。在战争期间，我们和朝鲜人民军曾肩并肩地冒着敌人的炮火前进；曾一起在烈日下行军，在寒夜里露营，在坑道中共餐；曾在艰险中互相支援，在胜利中同唱凯歌。我们将永远记得：朝鲜人民军同志们在多次战斗中，为协助我们进攻或掩护我们撤退而付出过血的代价；为抢救伤员而不惜牺牲；为使我们得到充分休息，给我们担任警戒；为解决我们生活上的困难，宁肯使自己忍受艰苦，把粮食、燃料送给我们。这种伟大友情，曾鼓舞着我们完成了各项艰巨的战斗任务。朝鲜人民在战争中，也同样以无比的热情支援我军，为我们修筑前进的道路；为我们送水送饭，运输伤员；让给我们房屋住，借给我们家具用；并多次给我们慰劳和鼓励。像朴在根烈士那样舍命抢救我们伤员的深切感人的事迹，为我们全体官兵永念不忘；像咸在福、具富力、石吉荣等著名的拥军支前模范，为我们全体官兵爱戴。战后，我们和朝鲜人民军，不但共同警卫在停战线上，而且还一起投入建设的高潮。我们之间的友情更发展了、深厚了。朝鲜党政军民每逢重大节日，都派代表团来慰问我们，给我们极大鼓舞，特别是当我们遇着危险的时候，总是尽最大力量使我们转危为安。朝鲜人民和军队对我们的支持和关怀，随时都在鼓舞着我们全军。
    中国人民志愿军，几年来不仅和朝鲜人民军共同粉碎了凶恶的敌人的进攻，取得了战争胜利。战后，我们又积极协助朝鲜人民重建家园。我们对朝鲜的一山一水，一草一木都有深厚的感情。我们的行动口号是“像建设祖国一样，帮助建设朝鲜”。在战争期间，我们就利用战斗间隙，为朝鲜人民盖房一万五千余间；修水渠堤坝二千七百余条；修桥二千七百余座。战后又帮助朝鲜人民进行大规模的修建工作。去年年初，志愿军领导机关号召全军以三十万个人工帮助朝鲜人民进行生产建设。这一号召受到全体官兵的热烈响应，到年底完成了六十三万七千多个人工，超过了原订计划一倍多。志愿军全体官兵，都把帮助朝鲜人民进行生产建设，看作自己最大的光荣。与此同时，我们还为朝鲜人民救灾、治病，同甘共苦；为了增进朝中友谊而进行多次友好访问，相互学习。朝鲜人民军的英勇顽强、不怕艰苦、严守纪律以及正规化的优良作风，是值得我们学习的；朝鲜人民的勤劳、勇敢、热爱祖国的优良品质，深深地铭刻在广大官兵的心里。朝中两国军队，在反抗共同敌人的斗争中形成的友谊，可以说是两国军队并肩战斗，亲密团结的模范。
    我们中国人民志愿军，十分珍爱我们和朝鲜人民军之间的战斗友谊。我们将不断地学习朝鲜人民军的优良作风；将尽最大的努力，以自己的劳动来帮助朝鲜人民建设和平幸福的生活；我们将永远和朝鲜人民及朝鲜人民军站在一起，为保卫远东和世界和平，为朝鲜的和平统一而奋斗。
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    朝中两国人民及其军队的牢不可破的友谊万岁！（附图片）
