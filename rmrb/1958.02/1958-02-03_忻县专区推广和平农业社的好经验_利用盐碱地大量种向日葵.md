　　Xinxian Special District Promotes the Good Experiences of the Peace Agricultural Cooperative
    Massively Planting Sunflowers in Saline-Alkali Land
    (Our report) The Xinxian Special District of Shanxi Province has decided to utilize 200,000 mu of saline-alkali land to plant sunflowers this year, increasing the planting area by seven times compared to last year.
    Fanzhi, Daixian, Guoxian, Xinxian, Dingxiang and other counties in the Xinxian Special District have more than 380,000 mu of saline-alkali land, distributed among 42 townships and 207 agricultural cooperatives along the banks of the Hutuo River. Due to the erosion of salt and alkali, ordinary crops do not grow easily in these areas, and the harvest is very small. In recent years, many agricultural cooperatives, according to the instructions of the Party and the government to "fully utilize and improve saline-alkali land" and "actively increase the production of oil crops without competing with grain for land," have planted sunflowers in saline-alkali land. The results have proved that sunflowers not only have the characteristics of drought and flood resistance, but also have strong resistance to salt and alkali erosion, and the benefits are greater than growing grain. For example, the Peace Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxiang County (including Zhaojiaying and Cuijiaying villages) tried planting two mu of sunflowers in 1954. After planting, it rained continuously, with an annual rainfall of more than 610 millimeters. Generally, large autumn crops were greatly reduced due to flooding and salt-alkali erosion. For example, millet only yielded 130 jin per mu (worth 8.3 yuan); sorghum yielded 150 jin per mu (worth 9.7 yuan); while sunflowers yielded an average of 200 jin per mu, worth 22 yuan, which was more than twice as much as sorghum and nearly twice as much as millet. Due to the success of the trial planting, the local people were greatly inspired, and the planting area increased year by year. In 1955, the cooperative planted 120 mu and achieved a high yield record of 250 jin per mu on average. In 1956, the planting area increased to 1,137 mu. Although the rainfall was too high (612 millimeters per year), the average yield was still 202 jin per mu, of which 54 mu yielded 304 jin, and 10.5 mu planted in lightly alkaline land yielded 400 jin. In 1957, the planting area increased to 1,256 mu. Although there was drought first, then frost, and a lack of fertilizer, the yield was still 115.5 jin per mu, of which 423 mu were intercropped with soybeans, yielding an additional 30 jin of soybeans per mu. The masses concluded that the characteristics of sunflowers were: "salt-resistant, alkali-resistant, waterlogging-resistant, and drought-resistant."
    This year, the Peace Agricultural Cooperative initially plans to plant 1,900 mu of sunflowers, with a planned yield of 250 jin per mu. They also made the following estimates of specific benefits:
    First, the benefit calculation for the agricultural cooperative itself: (1) The total output of sunflower seeds for the whole year is 475,000 jin. After deducting production investment, the actual income is 40,850 yuan. Intercropped soybeans can bring in 4,389 yuan. The total income from the two items is more than 45,200 yuan. (2) A total of 760,000 jin of sunflower heads can be produced. With appropriate combination of fine feed, 1,520 pigs can be raised (500 jin of feed per pig per year), with a net income of 73,520 yuan. (3) A total of 430,000 jin of sunflower leaves and soybean stalks can be produced, which can raise more than 2,100 sheep. Valued at 18 yuan per sheep, the net income is 28,400 yuan. (4) A total of more than 3,200 jin of wool can be produced, with a net income of more than 2,600 yuan. (5) Pigs and sheep can accumulate more than 23 million jin of fertilizer. Every 10,000 jin can increase grain production by 200 jin, for a total increase of 460,000 jin of grain. At 7 fen per jin of grain, the income is more than 32,300 yuan. (6) A total of 950,000 jin of sunflower stalks can be produced, with an income of 9,500 yuan. The total income of the above six items is more than 192,000 yuan. The average income per person for the entire cooperative of 2,032 people is 94 yuan, an increase of 44 yuan compared to the average total income of 50 yuan per person in the entire cooperative in 1957.
    Second, the calculation of benefits for the state: (1) 475,000 jin of sunflower seeds, calculated at an oil yield of 27%, can produce more than 128,200 jin of oil, which can supply 51,300 rural people with edible oil for one year (2.5 jin per person per year in the local rural area), and can supply the entire population of the cooperative with edible oil for more than 25 years. (2) The oil cake yield of sunflower seeds is calculated at 27%, which can produce more than 128,000 jin of oil cake, which can supply more than 2,700 pigs in the agricultural cooperative. (3) The shelling rate of sunflower seeds is calculated at 40%, producing a total of 190,000 jin of shells, which can supply more than 1,200 sheep in the agricultural cooperative (150 jin per sheep). (4) A total of 57,000 jin of soybeans, calculated at an oil yield of 12%, can produce more than 6,800 jin of soybean oil. (5) The oil cake yield of soybeans is calculated at 88%, which can produce more than 50,000 jin of soybean cake, which can supply more than 800 pigs in the agricultural cooperative.
    After accounting, the broad masses of cooperative members further realized that planting sunflowers on saline-alkali land not only does not affect or has little effect on grain production, but also has great benefits for increasing fertilizer, increasing grain yield, supporting the factory with oil, increasing the income of cooperative members and the state, improving people's lives, and improving the soil, thereby launching a mass production movement centered on improving alkaline land and accumulating fertilizer to prepare for the 1958 production.
    Under the leadership of Party organizations, many agricultural cooperatives in the Xinxian Special District have successively formulated plans to utilize saline-alkali land to plant sunflowers.

　　忻县专区推广和平农业社的好经验
    利用盐碱地大量种向日葵
    本报讯　山西忻县专区决定今年利用盐碱地种植向日葵二十万亩，比去年种植面积提高七倍。
    忻县专区的繁峙、代县、崞县、忻县、定襄等县，共有盐碱地三十八万余亩，分布在滹沱河两岸的四十二个乡、二百零七个农业社。由于盐碱的腐蚀，这些地区一般农作物不易生长，收获量很少。近几年来不少农业社根据党和政府“充分利用和改良盐碱地”、“在不与粮食争地的前提下，积极增产油料作物”的指示，在盐碱地里种植了向日葵。结果证明：向日葵不但有抗旱抗涝的特性，而且对盐碱腐蚀的抵抗力也很强，比种粮食的收益还大。如定襄县和平农业社（包括赵家营和崔家营两村），在1954年试种了向日葵二亩。种植后，一直是阴雨不断，年降雨量达六百一十多公厘，一般大秋作物都因天涝水浸和盐碱腐蚀而大量减产。如糜子每亩仅产一百三十斤（值价八元三角）；高粱每亩产一百五十斤（值价九元七角）；而向日葵每亩平均产到二百斤，值价二十二元，比高粱多收入一倍多，比糜子多收入近两倍。由于试种成功，当地群众得到极大的启示，播种面积逐年增加。1955年全社播种一百二十亩，获得每亩平均二百五十斤的丰产纪录。1956年播种面积增加到一千一百三十七亩，由于降雨量太大（年降六百一十二公厘），但每亩仍平均产二百零二斤，其中有五十四亩产到三百零四斤，轻碱地里种的十亩半竟产到四百斤。1957年播种面积增加到一千二百五十六亩，虽然由于先旱后冻和缺少肥料，但每亩仍产了一百一十五点五斤，其中有四百二十三亩间作黄豆，每亩还多产了黄豆三十斤。群众对向日葵的特性作了八个字的结论是：“耐盐、耐碱、耐涝、耐旱”。
    今年，和平农业社初步计划种向日葵一千九百亩，每亩计划产量二百五十斤。他们并对具体收益作了如下的测算：
    第一，对农业社本身的收益测算：（一）全年共产葵花籽四十七点五万斤，减去生产投资，实收入四万零八百五十元。间作的黄豆可收入四千三百八十九元。两项共收入四万五千二百多元。（二）共可产葵花头七十六万斤，适当搭配精饲料可以养猪一千五百二十口（每口猪一年饲料以五百斤计），纯收入七万三千五百二十元。（三）共可产葵花叶子和黄豆秸子四十三万斤，可以养羊二千一百多只。每只作价十八元，纯收入为二万八千四百元。（四）共可产羊毛三千二百多斤，纯收入为二千六百多元。（五）猪和羊共可积肥二千三百多万斤，每一万斤可增产粮食二百斤，共可增产粮食四十六万斤，每斤粮食以七分计，收入三万二千三百多元。（六）共可产葵花秆子九十五万斤，可收入九千五百元。以上六项合计收入十九万二千多元。全社二千零三十二人，每人平均收入九十四元，比1957年全社每人平均总收入五十元还增加了四十四元。
    第二，对国家收益的测算：（一）葵花籽四十七点五万斤，按27％的出油率计，共可产油十二万八千二百多斤，可供应五万一千三百个农村人口食用一年（当地农村每人每年供应二点五斤），可供应本社全部人口食用二十五年多。（二）葵花籽的出饼率以27％计，可产油饼十二万八千多斤。可供应农业社养猪二千七百多头。（三）葵花籽的出壳率以40％计，共出壳十九万斤，可供应农业社喂羊一千二百多只（每只羊以一百五十斤计）。（四）黄豆共五点七万斤，以出油率12％计，共产豆油六千八百多斤。（五）黄豆出饼率以88％计，可产豆饼五万多斤，可供农业社养猪八百多头。
    经过算账以后，广大的社员群众进一步认识了利用盐碱地种向日葵，不但不影响或很少影响粮食的产量，而且对增加肥料、提高粮食产量、支援工厂油料、增加社员与国家收入和改善人民生活、改良土壤都有极大的好处，从而以改良碱地和积肥为中心，掀起了一个为1958年生产做好准备的群众性的生产运动。
    忻县专区不少农业社在党组织的领导下都纷纷订出了利用盐碱地种植向日葵的计划。
