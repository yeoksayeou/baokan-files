I fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Bo Yibo on behalf of the State Council; the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen; the report on writing reform made by Elder Wu; and the report on the examination of representative qualifications. I suggest that the congress adopt these documents.

Now, I would like to report to the congress some information about the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory that I know.

I. Production Achievements Worthy of Pride

　　The Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory was originally a dilapidated repair shop, but now it produces all the machines used in textile factories, completing the First Five-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule, and also exporting to help Asian and African countries develop their textile industry.

　　The Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory was a dilapidated repair shop taken over from the enemy and puppets. Before 1951, it was still mainly engaged in repair work, with very few products. It was not until 1952 that it transformed into a factory producing textile machinery. The main products are carding machines and AC motors for textile factories. After entering the First Five-Year Plan, production has developed rapidly. The production of motors has increased more than six times compared to 1952, and the production of carding machines has increased more than two times compared to 1952. Under the leadership of the Party, all employees completed the First Five-Year Plan one year and twelve days ahead of schedule by carrying out socialist labor competitions, and also sent hundreds of veteran workers above grade five to support newly built factories.

　　The machines used in the older textile factories were all imported from foreign countries, but the complete set of machines used in the factories built after 1952 were all domestically produced. All motors and carding machines are now produced by our factory. Moreover, since 1956, the machines we produce have also been exported to help Asian and African countries such as Vietnam, Egypt, Burma, and Indonesia develop their textile industries. In 1953, the machines we produced also participated in the Leipzig International Exhibition and received good reviews. This surprised those capitalist countries who looked at the new China with old eyes. They could not imagine that our industry could develop so rapidly and be able to produce such good machines in just a few years since the founding of our country. From the actual use of various factories in China in recent years, the quality and efficiency of the products are not worse than foreign goods. This is a great progress, and the employees of our factory are often encouraged by this and feel proud. However, we are not complacent or arrogant. The workers realize that this honor can only be obtained under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, every time I come to a meeting, the workers ask me to thank the Party and Chairman Mao on their behalf for their education of us workers, and tell Chairman Mao: We must produce more new machines faster, better, and more economically.

II. Diligence and Frugality in Running Factories, Relying on the Masses

　　Do not require large state investment, do not add a large number of new equipment, but transform old enterprises, tap potential, consult with the masses on everything, and give play to the collective wisdom of the masses, not only producing machines, but also ensuring quality.

　　Production has been greatly developed and product quality has been gradually improved. How did this come about? Is it because the state invested a lot of money and added a lot of new equipment? No, in recent years, although the factory has successively added some new equipment, we mainly rely on the transformation of old enterprises, tapping potential, and learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. I can prove that it is possible to do more with less money by giving a few examples.

　　The pig iron furnace in our factory used to have a row of tuyeres, and the efficiency of iron smelting was very low. When producing three carding machines a day, two furnaces had to be used. We learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and changed the furnace to three rows of tuyeres. This greatly improved the efficiency of iron smelting. Since 1956, when producing eight carding machines a day, it was enough to use one furnace to smelt iron. This not only increased production, but also saved fuel and manpower. It also increased the temperature of the molten iron. There are also other equipment, such as milling machines, many of which were refitted by ourselves using some waste materials. In this way, although a large amount of new equipment has not been added, the production volume is still guaranteed to increase several times. In the process of implementing diligence and frugality in running enterprises, it is not without resistance. For example, some individual cadres want to be ostentatious, feeling that in a factory with thousands of people, putting the finished products and blanks on both sides of the road, building a mat shed, and then building another mat shed, is so crowded that even cars can hardly pass, which is very unseemly. However, because the vast number of employees understood the great significance of the central government's policy of "diligence and frugality in running enterprises," these ideas were promptly criticized. Experience has proved that the principle of relying on the masses works, and it is not possible not to consult with the masses. Our factory has these two examples: In 1954, the leaders planned to rebuild the baking kiln. When the bureau came down to consult with the workers, the result was that only the existing equipment was slightly repaired, and it could still be used for at least ten years without the need for rebuilding; another example is the finishing kiln that is currently being built. They did not consult with the workers before construction, resulting in more money being spent and it not being very suitable.

　　In terms of improving product quality, employees put forward the slogan of "more glorious and more glorious," not only to manufacture machines, but also to manufacture them well. Therefore, they also used a lot of brainpower. For example, for carding machines, they studied the different functions of various parts and found out which parts wore out severely and needed to have higher hardness. Before this, the same iron was used everywhere, so the parts that wore out severely broke early, affecting the life of the machine. After the employees' research, different grades of iron were used for casting according to the different performance requirements of different parts. The method of adding cold iron was used to increase the hardness of the iron to avoid shrinkage porosity. For some parts that require particularly high hardness, some scrap steel was added during casting and melted into the molten iron to increase its hardness. As a result, although we cannot all use high-quality steel to make machines, we have paid attention to the important parts, coupled with a strict inspection system, so the quality of the machines is guaranteed.

III. Striving for a Leap Forward Requires Support

　　In 1958, we will strive for a new leap forward on the basis of the victory in 1957. On the one hand, we will ensure the completion of the output stipulated by the state plan and continuously improve product quality; at the same time, we will actively trial-produce various new products and research and trial-produce various machines for spinning flax, wool, rayon, and chemical fibers to promote the development of China's textile industry.

　　We are now trial-producing new products such as wool carding machines, new carding machines, and metal card clothing. In the past, the cotton spinning card clothing used in various textile factories was imported from foreign countries, or materials were imported from foreign countries and then processed and manufactured by ourselves, which cost a lot of foreign exchange. Each set cost 85 pounds, equivalent to nearly 600 yuan in RMB, which must be a large figure nationwide. If we manufacture metal card clothing ourselves, we will not only save foreign exchange, but also save about half the cost compared to imported goods. On the other hand, the metal card clothing we trial-produce can also reduce the downtime for needle replacement and can improve the carding efficiency compared to the card clothing currently in use. Adding two working rollers under the burr roller can increase the carding efficiency by about 30% compared to the present. About 10,000 spindles can use a dozen fewer carding machines, which can reduce state investment for newly built textile factories. In 1958, the state plans to build new textile factories, which can save hundreds of machines and reduce the construction of many factory buildings. We hope that relevant departments can strongly support us so that this new product can be put into production as soon as possible.

　　Since the rectification campaign, all employees have been inspired with revolutionary vigor, striving for progress, and creating new production records more than 60,000 times from November to the end of January. For example, the youth embedding team in the motor workshop basically completed the February plan in January. The average production efficiency of this workshop increased by 30%. The chain team in the cold working workshop often failed to complete the plan before the rectification campaign. Since the start of the rectification campaign, they have overfulfilled the plan every month. In the mechanical workshop, 90% of the people created new records every day in September.

　　The concept of product quality has also been greatly strengthened among all employees. In the past, some workers in the assembly workshop often argued with the inspection personnel. Now, the workers attach importance to quality and seriously correct the opinions put forward by the inspection personnel. The outstanding effect of workers paying attention to quality is that the number of defective products and late repairs has been greatly reduced. For example, the scrap rate of the casting workshop in the third quarter of 1957 was 8.8%, while in the fourth quarter it was only 4.25%, a decrease of 52%, which was also 23% lower than the target required by the higher authorities.

　　At present, like the rest of the country, we have launched a widespread and in-depth anti-waste campaign, a production upsurge and a great leap forward in production, and launched a socialist labor competition. The slogan of all employees in our factory is: good trial production of new products, good product quality, good diligence and frugality, good safe production, good unity and mutual assistance, good learning of advanced experience, and good compliance with labor discipline.

　　This year, we will guarantee to improve quality, ensure safe production, overfulfill the state plan, and complete the task of trial-producing new products.

　　In completing the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, we still have some difficulties. The most prominent problem at present is that ball bearings cannot be fully supplied, so some of the carding machines and motors we produce do not have bearings installed. Therefore, they cannot be put into production immediately when they arrive at the textile factory. We hope that the higher authorities will help solve this problem.

　　Although there are still difficulties in our work, the experience of the past few years has proved that the ideological consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the workers can overcome any difficulties. Therefore, we believe that after the socialist debate, all employees will be able to overfulfill the tasks of 1958, strive for a new leap forward, and will be able to catch up with or surpass Britain in about fifteen years together with the people of the whole country.

    我们要更多更快更好更省地制造新机器
    刘同诰代表表达青岛纺织机械厂职工的决心
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理代表国务院所作的报告；彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告；吴老所作的文字改革报告；和代表资格审查的报告。建议大会通过这些文件。
    现在仅就我所知道的青岛纺织机械厂的一些情况，向大会汇报一下。
    一、生产成就值得自豪
    青岛纺机厂原是一个破烂修配厂，现在生产全部纺织厂所用机器，提前一年多完成了第一个五年计划，而且还出口帮助亚非国家发展纺织业。
    青岛纺织机械厂，是从敌伪手中接受下来的一个破烂修配厂，在一九五一年以前，仍旧主要是做一些修配的工作，产品很少。从一九五二年开始，才转变成为一个生产纺织机器的工厂。主要产品是梳棉机和纺织厂用的交流电动机。进入第一个五年计划后，生产有了飞跃的发展，电动机的生产比一九五二年增加了六倍多，梳棉机的生产比一九五二年增加了两倍多。全体职工在党的领导下，通过开展社会主义劳动竞赛，提前一年零十二天完成了第一个五年计划，并且输送出数百名五级以上的老工人，支援新建的工厂。
    建厂老一点的纺织厂中所用的机器，都是靠外国进口，但是从一九五二年以后建厂的，全套机器就都是我们国产了，所有的电动机和梳一类的机器现在都是我们厂出产的。不仅如此，从一九五六年起，我们生产的机器还出口了一些帮助越南、埃及、缅甸、印度尼西亚等亚非国家发展纺织工业。一九五三年我们生产的机器还参加了莱比锡国际展览，得到了好评。使那些用旧眼光看新中国的资本主义国家感到惊讶，他们想不到，我们建国仅仅几年竟使工业发展的这样迅速，能够造出这样好的机器。从这几年国内各厂实际使用来看，产品的质量和效率都不比外国货差。这是一个很大的进步，我们厂的职工常常因此而受到鼓舞，感到自豪。但是，我们并没有自满和骄傲，工人们都认识到这种荣誉只有在党的领导下才能得到，所以我每次来开会，工人都让我代表他们感谢党和毛主席对我们工人的教导，告诉毛主席：我们一定要更快、更好、更省的，生产出更多的新机器。
    二、勤俭办事依靠群众
    不要国家大量投资，不是增添大量新设备，而是改造旧企业，挖潜力，事事同群众商量，发挥群众的集体智慧，不仅造出了机器，还保证了质量。
    生产得到了很大的发展，产品质量逐步提高，是怎样得来的呢？是不是因为国家投了大量的资金，增添了大量的新设备呢？不是的，几年来，工厂虽然陆续增添了一些新的设备，但主要的我们还是依靠对旧企业的改造，挖掘潜力，学习运用苏联的先进经验。我举出几个例子就可以证明，少花钱也可以多办事。
    我厂的化铁炉，过去都是一排风口，化铁的效率很低，每日生产三台梳棉机时，就得两座炉都用。我们学习了苏联先进经验，把炉子改为三排风口，这样化铁的效率大大提高了，从一九五六年每日产八台梳棉机，只用一座炉化铁就够了。既增了产，又节约了燃料和人力。并且提高了化铁水的温度。还有其它的一些设备，如铣床等有许多就是我们自己用一些废料改装的。就是这样虽然没有增加大量的新设备，生产量仍旧保证了数倍的增加。在贯彻勤俭办企业的过程中，也不是没有阻力的，例如有个别的干部要排场，觉得几千人的一个厂子，把做出来的成品和毛坯都放在路两旁，搭一个席棚，又搭一个席棚，拥挤的几乎连汽车都走不开，很不像样子。但是由于广大职工了解了中央指示的“勤俭办企业”方针的重大意义，这些思想都受到了及时的批判。经验证明了：只要依靠群众这条方针就能行得通，不和群众商量就不行。我厂有这样两个例子：在一九五四年领导上曾计划要改建烤型窑，局里下来和工人一商量，结果只把现有设备稍加修理，至少还能再用十年根本用不着改建；另外是现在正在修建的定性窑，动工前就没和工人商量，结果多花了钱，还并不太合用。
    在提高产品质量方面，职工提出光荣更光荣的口号，不仅要造出机器，而且要造的好，因此也用了许多脑筋，例如梳棉机，就研究了各种零件的不同作用，找出了哪些机件磨损的厉害，需要有较高的硬度。在这以前是不论什么地方都用一样的铁，因此磨损利害的机件早早的就坏了，影响机器的寿命。经过职工的研究，按不同零件所要求的不同性能，分别使用不同等级的铁来铸造，有用加冷铁的办法提高铁的硬度避免缩松，对一些需要特别硬的零件，在铸造时再加一些废钢，化在铁水里，提高它的硬度。这样做的结果，使我们虽然还不能都用质量好的钢铁来造机器，但是重要的部件我们都注意了，再加上严格的检验制度，所以机器的质量也就有了保证。
    三、争取跃进需要支援
    一九五八年我们将在一九五七年胜利的基础上争取新跃进。一方面保证完成国家计划规定的产量和不断提高产品质量；同时，积极试制各种新产品，研究试制用于麻、毛、人造纤维和化学纤维纺织的各种机械，以促进我国纺织工业的发展。
    我们现在正在试制梳毛机、新型梳棉机和金属针布等新产品。在过去各纺织厂用的棉纺针布都是从国外进口，或是从国外进口材料，再自己加工制造，耗费的外汇很大，每套要八十五英镑，合人民币近六百元，全国算起来一定是一个很大的数字。如果我们自己制造金属针布，不仅节省了外汇，而且成本比进口货节约一半左右。另一方面我们试制的金属针布，还可以减少抄针的停车时间，可以比现在用的针布提高梳棉效率，再在刺毛辊下面加两个工作辊，这样就能使梳棉机效率比现在提高百分之三十左右。大约一万纱锭可以少用十几台梳棉机，对新建纺织厂就可减少国家投资。一九五八年国家计划新建的纺织厂，就可省下几百台机器，就可少建许多厂房，我们希望有关部门能大力支持我们，使这项新产品及早的投入生产。
    整风以来，全体职工鼓起了革命干劲，力争上游，自十一月到一月底，创造生产新纪录六万多次，如电机车间青年嵌线组，在一月份就基本上完成了二月份的计划，这个车间平均生产效率提高30％。冷作车间链条小组在整风前经常完不成计划，整风开始每月都超额完成计划，机械车间九月份每天有90％的人创造新纪录。
    全体职工对产品质量的观念也大大加强了，装配车间过去有些工人常和检验人员争执，现在工人重视了质量，对检验人员提出的意见认真改正。由于工人注意了质量的效果，突出的表现在废品和迟修件大大减少。如铸工车间一九五七年第三季度废品率8.8％，而第四季度仅4.25％，降低了52％，也比上级所要求的指标降低23％。
    目前我们同全国一样，已掀起了一个广泛深入的反浪费运动，掀起了生产高潮和生产大跃进，开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，我们全厂职工的口号是：新产品试制好、产品质量好、勤俭节约好、安全生产好、团结互助好、学习先进经验好、遵守劳动纪律好。
    我们今年将保证提高质量、安全生产、超额完成国家计划和新产品试制任务。
    在完成第二个五年计划的任务中，我们也还存在着一些困难，目前最突出的就是滚珠轴承得不到充分的供应，使我们生产出的一些梳棉机、电动机没有轴承安装，因此到了纺织厂不能立即投入生产，希望上级帮助解决。
    工作中虽然还有困难，但是几年来的经验证明了：工人的思想觉悟和劳动热情，可以克服任何的困难。因此我们相信，全体职工在经过了社会主义大辩论之后，一定能够超额完成一九五八年的任务，争取新的跃进，一定能够和全国人民一起在十五年左右赶上或超过英国。
