Take Action Quickly and Improve Hygiene
    Some Units in Qingdao Have Terrible Hygiene
    (Our report) Qingdao has put forward the slogan of striving to become a "Four-Without" city this year. However, judging from the current situation, the progress of the movement is very uneven. What is particularly prominent is that the hygiene of a small number of collective units such as government offices, enterprises, and factories is still lagging behind that of street residents. The street offices in Taixi District recently organized a major hygiene inspection. Among the 184 courtyards inspected, although clean households accounted for more than 95%, the hygiene work of some government offices, factories, and enterprises was very poor. Street cadres have repeatedly raised opinions to them, requesting them to clean the hygiene areas they are responsible for, but most units still do not improve. In the kitchen of Qingdao People's Broadcasting Station, dust has accumulated thickly on the steamer lids, and the bowls, chopsticks, and basins are not clean. The three dormitories are also extremely unhygienic. In particular, the sewage pipes in the Feixian Road dormitory are broken, and feces are overflowing, affecting the surrounding environmental hygiene. The window glass of the kitchen, cafeteria, and office of the Runhua Wood Factory on Feixian Road has not been wiped to this day, and the courtyard has not been cleaned. Most of the residents and toilets in the Rubber Factory No. 9 dormitory are also very dirty.

　　赶快行动起来，搞好卫生
    青岛市有些单位卫生工作很糟
    本报讯　青岛市已经提出了争取今年成为“四无”城市的口号。但是从目前情况来看，运动进展情况很不平衡，尤其突出的是少数机关、企业、工厂等集体单位的卫生状况，至今仍落后于街道居民。台西区各街道办事处最近组织了一次卫生大检查，被检查的一百八十四个院中，虽然清洁干净的户占到95％以上，可是还有一些机关、工厂、企业的卫生工作就做得很差劲。街道干部曾经多次向他们提出意见，要求他们清扫所负责的卫生区域，但是大多数单位还是不改进。青岛市人民广播电台厨房里的笼屉盖上，灰尘已积得很厚，碗、筷、盆都不干净，三处宿舍也极不卫生，特别是费县路宿舍的污水管道坏了，粪便四溢，影响到周围的环境卫生。费县路润华木厂的厨房、食堂和办公室的窗玻璃，至今未擦，院子也未打扫。橡胶九厂宿舍大多数住户和厕所也都很脏。
