    Commemorating the Eleventh Anniversary of the February 28th Uprising
    Li Chunqing
      Every year on this day—February 28th—we especially
  miss our elders, brothers, and sisters in Taiwan who are in distress. Our hearts often cross thousands of mountains and rivers, cross the Taiwan Strait, and return to Taiwan. With the Chinese mainland entirely liberated today, only Taiwan is still under U.S. military occupation, a reality that cannot but weigh heavily on our hearts.
    But today, this year, our mood is different; we have another kind of excitement and optimism.
    Why are we happy? Because we personally see the motherland of the Taiwanese people—the People's Republic of China—full of youthful vitality, advancing like flying, and advancing in the posture of a giant. China has overfulfilled its first Five-Year Plan and can produce more than five million tons of steel and over 120 million tons of coal annually. And this year, in the first year of the second Five-Year Plan, 600 million people are all stirring up revolutionary fervor, leaping forward on the industrial and agricultural fronts with an overwhelming momentum. Our country's goal is to catch up with and surpass Britain in the production of steel and other industrial products within fifteen years. China's leap towards socialist industrialization is also a leap towards the prospect of liberating Taiwan.
    The United States occupies Taiwan by relying on imperialist force. Since ancient times, no country can rely solely on force, disregarding justice, and not be ultimately defeated. The Taiwanese people have witnessed the decline of Japanese imperialism. People can see that the post-war international situation is one in which socialist forces are rising and imperialist forces are declining. The United States' position of strength is weakening year by year. Take atomic weapons, for example. At the end of World War II, the United States monopolized the secret of atomic weapons and used them to threaten and blackmail other countries. Four years later, in 1949, the Soviet Union announced that it had atomic weapons; four years later, in 1953, the Soviet Union declared the successful testing of a hydrogen bomb; another four years, last year, the Soviet Union successfully tested intercontinental missiles, and two artificial satellites went into space. At this time, the United States lagged behind in the latest weapons and important science and technology. If the United States still had some atomic advantage when it occupied Taiwan in 1950, then in today's missile age, the United States is already at a disadvantage. The United States is not only declining in its position of strength, but also its domestic economic crisis has been worsening in the past year, and its economic power is also declining. Today's situation is already: socialist forces prevail over imperialist forces, the forces of peace prevail over the forces of war, and the East wind prevails over the West wind. The United States' reliance on force to occupy Taiwan cannot last long.
    Even though the domestic and international situations are conducive to the liberation of Taiwan, like all historical aggressors, the American aggressors are by no means willing to withdraw from Taiwan voluntarily. In 1950, the United States attempted to strangle the young People's Republic of China from three directions: Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan. After three years of bloody war and complex and acute diplomatic struggles, the United States failed in Korea and Indochina. The United States knows that China cannot be deceived on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, so it is conspiring to create
  "Two Chinas" to seek a legitimate position for the permanent occupation of Taiwan. To realize this conspiracy, the United States has been preparing public opinion for several years. In October last year, at the 19th International Red Cross Conference held in New Delhi, the United States insisted on inviting representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek Group to participate, which was the most blatant performance of the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." The so-called "Two Chinas" is not just in one form. In addition to maintaining the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan as the "Government of the Republic of China," there are also absurd proposals such as handing Taiwan over to "United Nations Trusteeship" and creating a "Republic of Taiwan." In December last year, U.S. Senator Morse in Tokyo advocated "handing Taiwan over to the United Nations Trusteeship." In January this year, authoritative sources in Washington said: The United States may revive its plan to support an independent "Republic of Taiwan." No matter what form the United States uses, the essence of "Two Chinas" is to separate Taiwan from the motherland, allowing it to occupy Taiwan forever and making the Taiwanese people slaves of the United States forever. We must resolutely oppose this.
    Needless to say, the dignified citizens of the People's Republic of China—the Taiwanese people—will never be slaves of foreign countries. The Taiwanese people will never allow their homeland to be used by foreign countries as a foothold for aggression against the motherland. If the United States is not forgetful, it should remember what happened less than a year ago.
  On May 24, 1957, an anti-American demonstration broke out in Taipei, destroying the U.S. Embassy and tearing up the American Stars and Stripes. The Taiwanese people have already spoken out in action and expressed their attitude towards the United States. Is there any need for a "referendum"? If we link the Taipei anti-American demonstration with the February 28th Uprising eleven years ago, then the free will of the Taiwanese people is: oppose the United States! Oppose the Chiang Kai-shek Group! The free will of the Taiwanese people is: demand that the U.S. aggressive forces immediately withdraw from Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek is not qualified to represent China, nor can he represent Taiwan and the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people will not allow any country to be established in their homeland. Taiwan has never been a country and will never be a country in the future.
    No one knows better than the Taiwanese people: there is only one motherland, and that is the People's Republic of China. Without it, the future of Taiwan can only be a colony; without the motherland, the fate of the Taiwanese people is slavery. With decades of experience, the Taiwanese people deeply know that to liberate themselves, they must rely on the motherland. The Taiwanese people demand to return to the motherland, just like children demanding to return to their mother's side, and no one can stop them. If someone says to the Taiwanese people, "Your Taiwan is a country," the Taiwanese people will definitely think you are crazy. If someone says that the status of Taiwan is undetermined, that is scolding the Taiwanese people for being a people without a country. This is a slander against the Taiwanese people, and we must never tolerate this malicious slander that disregards the dignity of the Chinese people.
    Everyone knows what ethnic group they belong to. The Taiwanese people certainly know what ethnic group they belong to. But some people insist on calling a deer a horse, saying that the Taiwanese residents are not Han Chinese. Yes, like other provinces on the mainland that have ethnic minorities, Taiwan also has ethnic minorities in the Chinese national family, namely, the Gaoshan ethnic compatriots. But the vast majority of Taiwanese residents, accounting for more than 95%, are children of the Han Chinese, who are historically ancient, hardworking, and brave children of the Han Chinese. In order to split Taiwan, falsely claiming that Taiwanese Han residents are not Han Chinese, according to our traditional customs, this is not only an insult to the living, but also an insult to our ancestors. We cannot tolerate this insult.
    Because the vast majority of Taiwanese residents are Han Chinese, even after fifty years of Japanese rule, their customs and even ideology have not changed, and they are exactly the same as Han residents on the mainland. The Taiwanese people believe that Taiwan Province should be the same as other provinces on the mainland and there is nothing special about it. Now, according to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, only ethnic minorities need autonomy; in Taiwan, except for the mountainous areas, there is no need for autonomy. Therefore, the so-called Taiwan autonomy is unfounded and has ulterior motives. This proposition is also to create arguments for "Two Chinas," attempting to separate Taiwan from the motherland. In short, all the fallacies aimed at creating "Two Chinas" are fallacies that rape the will of the Taiwanese people, and all are conspiracies and tricks that are diametrically opposed to the interests of the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people will resolutely oppose these fallacies and conspiracies to the end.
    No matter how many conspiracies the imperialists have, the Taiwanese people understand in their hearts. There are two worlds in front of them, one is today's Taiwan under the rule of the U.S. and Chiang, what they see is: Taichung has been dry for a long time, and farmers are bent over by debt. Rice prices in Taipei are soaring, and unemployed people wandering the streets take jumping into the Tamsui River as their final destination. An American warship rammed and sank a fishing boat in the waters off Tainan, and Kuomintang officers carried carbines and strafed employees of a car company in Zhongli. Judges commit suicide, and journalists are jailed. And the officialdom is a scene of debauchery, corruption, and fraud. Employees of the pseudo-Taichung County Government reported an average of 490 days of travel expenses per person per year. From Keelung to Eluanbi, there is such an infuriating scene everywhere.
    And in the motherland is another world, what we see is: on the water plateau, rice fields fly up the mountain. In the freezing cold, the lights are all over the mountains and plains, night is like day, and hundreds of millions of farmers are building water conservancy projects day and night. This year, on average, a new large factory or mine will be completed every forty-six hours. All pests and harmful birds have been subjected to unprecedented extermination. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, here there is nothing that is not promoted if it is beneficial, and no abuse that is not eliminated, and the whole country is working hard to build socialism. And on the scaffolding of every newly built high-rise building, on every newly installed boiler, large banners can often be seen with the words: "Strive for the liberation of Taiwan!" The Taiwanese people have such an unprecedented motherland and its 600 million brothers, may I ask, can such a motherland allow its territory to be reduced to a colony forever? Can the Chinese people allow their compatriots to be slaves of foreign countries forever? Impossible, a thousand impossibilities!
    For several generations, the Taiwanese people have looked north to the Central Plains, hoping that the motherland would become strong. Now they have finally waited for it. Although they can only look across the sea, they have seen the powerful motherland coming towards Taiwan, and the footsteps are getting louder and louder, and closer and closer. No matter how far or near the road to liberate Taiwan is, we will one day reach that destination. The Taiwanese compatriots will one day break away from the dark world of the U.S. and Chiang reactionary rule and return to the embrace of the beloved mother—the great motherland.
    In such a great era, in such a favorable situation, on this day commemorating the eleventh anniversary of the February 28th Uprising, we call on: the Taiwanese compatriots on the mainland, we are all good sons and daughters of the great motherland, we should unite with the compatriots of the motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, stir up revolutionary fervor, plunge into the torrent of building socialism, leap forward again and again, and leap forward greatly! Every effort we make here, in the motherland, every drop of strength, will converge to become the strength to liberate Taiwan.
    We call on: the members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League to rise up, and on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, actively participate in the general rectification of the league. The country is leaping forward. The world is advancing. The times are advancing. Groups and individuals should also advance, failing to advance will lag behind and will not be able to adapt to the rapidly developing situation. Members of the TDSGL should carry out the transformation of their political positions and should have a great leap in their thinking. We have a responsibility to transform the TDSGL into a socialist political group, to serve the construction of the motherland and the liberation of Taiwan.

    纪念二·二八起义十一周年
    李纯青
      每年今天——2月28日，我们特别
  怀念在苦难中的台湾父老兄弟。我们的心常常越过千山万水，越过台湾海峡，回到了台湾。在中国大陆已经全部解放的今天，只有台湾还在美国武力侵占之下，这个现实，不能不使人心情沉重。
    但是今年今天，我们的心情不同了，我们另有一种兴奋和乐观的心情。
    为什么我们高兴呢？因为我们亲见台湾人民的祖国——中华人民共和国充满着青春的活力，像飞一样地前进，而且是以巨人的姿态在前进着。中国已经超额完成了第一个五年计划，能够年产钢铁五百多万吨，煤炭一亿二千余万吨。而今年，在第二个五年计划的头一年，六亿人民一齐鼓起革命干劲，在工业和农业战线上，以排山倒海的声势向前跃进中。我国的目标是：要在十五年后，在钢铁和其它工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。中国向社会主义工业化道路的跃进，也就是向解放台湾的前途跃进。
    美国霸占台湾是凭借帝国主义的武力。自古以来，没有一个国家可以单凭武力，不讲道义，而能不遭到最后失败的。台湾人民看见过日本帝国主义的没落。人们都可以看到，战后的国际形势，是社会主义的力量在上升，帝国主义的势力在下降。美国的实力地位一年不如一年了。就以原子武器来说吧。第二次世界大战结束的时候，美国独占原子武器的秘密，以此向别国进行威胁和讹诈。四年以后，1949年苏联就宣布有原子武器；再四年即1953年，苏联声明试验氢弹成功；又四年，即在去年，苏联试验洲际导弹成功，两颗人造卫星上了天，这时候，美国在最新武器和重要科学技术方面一齐落后了。如果说1950年美国霸占台湾当时，它还有什么原子优势的话，那么在今天导弹时代，美国已经处于劣势了。美国不仅在实力地位方面衰退，最近一年来，国内经济危机也日益恶化，经济力量也在衰退中。今天形势已经是：社会主义力量胜过帝国主义力量，和平的力量胜过战争的力量，已经是东风压倒西风。美国依靠武力霸占台湾是不可长久了。
    虽然如此，国内外形势都有利于台湾的解放，但像所有历史上的侵略者那样，美国侵略者绝不甘于自动退出台湾。1950年美国曾企图从朝鲜、印度支那、台湾三方面来扼杀年青的中华人民共和国。经过三年的流血战争，又经过了复杂尖锐的外交斗争，美国在朝鲜和印度支那都告失败了。美国知道在战场上和外交桌上中国不可欺，于是就阴谋制造
  “两个中国”，为永久侵占台湾谋取合法的地位。为了这一阴谋的实现，美国已经准备了几年的舆论，去年10月，在新德里召开的第十九届国际红十字大会上，美国坚持邀请蒋介石集团代表参加，这是阴谋制造“两个中国”的一次最露骨的表演。所谓“两个中国”也并非仅有一种形式，除掉保持蒋介石集团在台湾为“中华民国政府”以外，还有台湾交“联合国托管”，制造“台湾共和国”等等荒谬主张。去年12月美国参议员莫尔斯在东京就主张把台湾“交给联合国托管”，今年1月，华盛顿权威人士说：美国可能复活支持一个独立的“台湾共和国”的计划。不论美国用什么形式，“两个中国”的实质内容都是要使台湾脱离祖国，让它永远侵占台湾，让台湾人民永远做美国的奴隶。我们都要坚决反对。
    用不着说，堂堂的中华人民共和国公民——台湾人民，绝不会做外国的奴隶。台湾人民决不能容许自己的生身之地给外国做侵略祖国的立脚点。如果美国不健忘，应该记得不到一年前的事。
  1957年5月24日，台北爆发的反美示威，捣毁了美国大使馆，撕碎了美国星条旗，台湾人民已经以行动说了话，对美国表示了态度，难道还需要什么“公民投票”吗？如果把台北反美示威和十一年前二·二八起义联起来看，那么，台湾人民的自由意志就是：反对美国！反对蒋介石集团！台湾人民的自由意志就是：要求美国侵略势力立即从台湾撤出。蒋介石没有资格代表中国，也不能代表台湾和台湾人民。台湾人民不容许在他们的家园建立一个什么国家，台湾从来不是一个国家，将来也永远不会是一个国家。
    没有人比台湾人更清楚：祖国只有一个，那就是中华人民共和国。离开了它，台湾的前途只能是殖民地；没有祖国，台湾人的命运就是奴隶。积数十年的经验，台湾人民深知欲解放自己，必须依靠祖国。台湾人民要求回归祖国，就像孩子要求回到母亲身边那样，没有人能够阻挡。如果有人对台湾人说，你们台湾是一个国家，台湾人一定会以为你是疯子。如果有人说台湾地位未定，那就是骂台湾人是无国之民。这是对台湾人民的诽谤，我们绝不能容忍这种无视中国人民尊严的恶意诽谤。
    任何人都知道自己属于什么民族。台湾人民当然也知道自己属于什么民族。但是却有人硬要指鹿为马，说台湾居民不是汉族。是的，像大陆其它省份有少数民族一样，台湾也有中国民族大家庭中的少数民族，即高山族同胞。但是台湾居民的绝大多数，占95％以上，都是汉族的儿女，都是历史悠久、勤劳勇敢的汉族儿女。为了要分裂台湾，诬说台湾汉族居民不是汉族，按照我们传统的习惯，这不但是侮辱活着的人，而且是侮辱我们的祖宗。对于这种侮辱，我们不能忍受。
    因为台湾居民绝大多数都是汉族，即使经过日本统治五十年，风俗习惯以至意识形态并无改变，和大陆上的汉族居民完全一样。台湾人民认为，台湾省应该和大陆各省一样，没有什么特殊。现在根据中华人民共和国宪法，只有少数民族才需要自治；在台湾，除高山地区以外，是不需要自治的。因此，所谓台湾自治是没有根据的，是别有用心的。这种主张也是为“两个中国”制造论据，企图使台湾脱离祖国。总而言之，以制造“两个中国”为目的的种种谬论，无一不是强奸台湾人民意志的谬论，无一不是和台湾人民利益势不两立的阴谋诡计。台湾人民对于这些谬论和阴谋，誓必反对到底。
    不管帝国主义者有多少阴谋，台湾人民心里明白。摆在他们面前有两个世界，一个是在美蒋统治下的今日台湾，他们看到的是：台中久旱不雨，农民被债务压弯了腰。台北米价飞涨，流浪在街头的失业者以跳入淡水河为最后的归宿。美国军舰在台南海面撞沉了渔船，国民党军官携带卡宾枪在中坜扫射汽车公司的职员。法官自杀，新闻记者坐牢。而官场中是一片纸醉金迷，贪污舞弊，伪台中县政府职员每人平均每年上报四百九十天的出差费。从基隆到鹅銮鼻，到处都是这样一片令人发指的惨象。
    而在祖国是另一个世界，我们看到的是：水上高原，稻田飞上山。在冰天雪地里，灯火漫山遍野，夜晚当白天，日日夜夜有一亿农民在兴修水利。今年平均每隔四十六小时就要建设完成一座新的大工厂或大矿山。所有害虫害鸟都遭到史无前例的大歼灭。在共产党领导下，这里是无利不兴，无弊不除，全国都在努力建设社会主义。而在每一个新建高楼的脚手架上，每一个新装的锅炉上，常常可以看见大幅标语写着：“为解放台湾而奋斗！”台湾人民有这样前所未有的祖国及其六亿兄弟，请问，这样的祖国能够让自己的领土永远沦为殖民地吗？这样的中国人民能够让自己的同胞永远沦为外国的奴隶吗？不可能，一千个不可能！
    好几代的台湾人民都曾北望中原，盼望祖国强盛起来。现在终于盼到了。虽然他们还只能够隔海而望，他们已经看见强大的祖国正在向台湾走来，脚步声已经越来越响，越来越近了。不管解放台湾的路程远近，我们总有一天要达到那个终点。台湾同胞总有一天要脱离美蒋反动统治的黑暗世界，回到亲爱的母亲——伟大祖国的怀抱里来。
    在这样伟大的时代，这样有利的形势下，在纪念二·二八起义十一周年的今天，我们号召：在大陆的台湾同胞，我们都是伟大祖国的好儿女，应该和祖国同胞团结在一起，在中国共产党领导下，鼓起革命干劲，投入建设社会主义的洪流，跃进再跃进，大大地跃进！我们在这里，在祖国，所作的每一个努力，每一滴力量，都将汇归成为解放台湾的力量。
    我们号召：台湾民主自治同盟的成员起来，在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，积极参加盟的一般整风。国家在跃进。世界在前进。时代在前进。团体和个人也应该前进，不前进则将落后，将不能适应迅速发展的形势。台盟盟员应该进行政治立场的改造，应该来个思想大跃进。我们有责任，把台盟改造成为社会主义的政治团体，为建设祖国和解放台湾而服务。
