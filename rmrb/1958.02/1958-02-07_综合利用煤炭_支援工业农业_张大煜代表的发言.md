Comprehensive Utilization of Coal to Support Industry and Agriculture
    Speech by Delegate Zhang Dazhao

    I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget” and Vice Premier Bo Yibo’s “Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan.” I also warmly endorse the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme proposed by the Chinese Language Reform Committee.

    This conference is a conference to welcome a high tide of socialist construction. In the short few months since the last conference, many inspiring things have happened at home and abroad. The Party Central Committee has timely put forward the call to strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the next fifteen years or a little more. The people of the whole country have been stirred up with great revolutionary enthusiasm and are striding forward on the first step of our country's Second Five-Year Plan.

    Failure to Implement Comprehensive Coal Utilization Will Lead to Alarming Waste

    What I want to emphasize today is how to fully utilize our country's abundant coal resources, a favorable factor, to solve certain major problems in our industrial and agricultural construction, that is, how to comprehensively utilize coal to support the development of agriculture and industry.

    In agriculture, solving the problem of "eating" and "clothing" for our country's ever-growing population is a problem that we need to pay great attention to for a considerable period in the future. However, under our country's conditions, the development of agriculture encounters the difficulty of having little cultivated land, and agricultural mechanization also encounters the difficulty of lacking liquid fuels. It is of course not good to encounter these difficulties, but it is also good. If we treat these problems with a revolutionary attitude, it will greatly promote our country's synthetic fertilizer, synthetic fiber, and artificial liquid fuel industries.

    These difficulties, on the one hand, will greatly promote the chemical industry and artificial liquid fuel industry. In the foreseeable future, we will become a highly chemicalized country, and chemical products will occupy an important position in all aspects of our clothing, food, housing, and transportation. On the other hand, these difficulties will also greatly promote the development of our country's chemical, fuel, and other related sciences and technologies, and will promote us to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in these areas as soon as possible.

    Our chemical industry and artificial liquid fuel industry can be greatly developed because our country has extremely rich coal resources and an incomparably superior social system. This system guarantees that we can comprehensively plan our country's industrial and agricultural construction and comprehensively utilize our country's rich coal resources on a national scale to benefit the people. In addition to supplying heat, the comprehensive utilization of coal can also provide a large amount of chemical industrial raw materials and artificial liquid fuels.

    The so-called "comprehensive utilization," in our country's old saying, is "making the best use of everything." Our people have always been diligent and thrifty, and there are many examples of "comprehensive utilization" in our lives. For example, in rural areas, the waste heat from heating the kang and cooking is fully utilized.

    Coal has many different uses. Take bituminous coal as an example, because our country has more bituminous coal. Now, most of our bituminous coal is burned in household stoves and factory boilers. We only get heat directly from it, and nothing else, and it also makes the city full of coal smoke. If we do not directly burn bituminous coal, but first burn it into coke and use coke to burn the stoves, what else can we get besides heat? We can make a simple calculation of about 20 million tons, which is 40 percent of last year's civilian coal consumption. The result of the calculation is alarming. We can use the coal gas obtained from coking to produce about 6 million tons of ammonium sulfate (which can be used to increase grain production by about 36 billion catties); about 200,000 tons of crude benzene can be produced from the light oil obtained from coking (which can be used to produce about 100,000 tons of synthetic fiber Kapron, which can make 600 million shirts); dozens of chemical products in the thousands or tens of thousands of tons can also be obtained from coal tar, plastics, and medicines.

    No one would want to burn fertilizers, clothing, plastics, medicines, etc. in a stove, but many of our families and factories are doing so invisibly. This invisible waste is truly alarming.

    The use of coal changes with the development of science and technology. In the past, mankind only regarded it as fuel, and it is still our main source of energy today. But today we have begun to enter a new era of human conquest of nature. Atomic energy and thermonuclear reaction energy will become our inexhaustible source of energy. In the future, coal will become one of the most precious chemical industrial raw materials. We are currently in a transitional period. During this transitional period, the characteristics of coal utilization are that it is both used as fuel and as a chemical industrial raw material. This period is the period of comprehensive utilization of fuel and chemicals. Our industrial construction should conform to the characteristics of this period.

    Therefore, whether from the perspective of solving the difficulties in our country's current national economic construction or from the perspective of the prospects of scientific and technological development, the comprehensive utilization of coal is in line with the law and objective needs.

    Several Major Ways of Comprehensive Utilization of Coal

    There are many ways to comprehensively utilize coal. Based on various considerations, there are roughly the following major ways:

    (1) For civilian coal, most of our country's coal is currently used for civilian purposes. Therefore, several million tons of tar and coal gas can be recovered from civilian coal. In large cities, urban gasification can be implemented, using part of the gas and semi-coke as fuel for civilian and urban industrial use. This can obtain raw materials for producing synthetic fertilizers, synthetic fibers, synthetic plastics, etc. At the same time, it can save urban coal consumption, save urban transportation, and greatly improve urban sanitation.

    For coal used in small and medium-sized cities and villages, low-temperature or medium-temperature carbonization can be considered first. Part of the semi-coke is supplied for civilian use, and part is supplied for synthetic ammonia. Low-temperature tar can be processed into liquid fuel, and raw materials for synthetic fibers and plastics can be extracted from it.

    (2) For coal used in thermal power plants, the combination of low-temperature carbonization and power plants should also be considered. About 50,000 tons of liquid products can be recovered from a 1 billion kilowatt-hour power plant, which can be further processed into liquid fuels, synthetic fibers, plastics, insecticides, flotation agents, tanning agents, etc.

    (3) The production of metallurgical coke currently has a preliminary form of comprehensive utilization. From coking plants, in addition to metallurgical coke, we can also obtain products such as coal gas and high-temperature tar. These can be further processed into nitrogen fertilizer, synthetic fiber, etc. At present, the recovery rate of by-products such as tar and coal gas in our country's coking plants is quite high, but it can still be improved. There is still a lot of room for improvement here. Our country's steel industry will catch up with or surpass Britain in fifteen years or a little more. Fifteen years later, our country will produce more than 30 million tons of metallurgical coke. If the recovery rate of by-products such as crude benzene is increased by one-thousandth, more than 30,000 tons of crude benzene can be produced, which can make 90 million Kapron shirts.

    To Achieve Comprehensive Utilization of Coal, Scientific and Technological Research Must be Strengthened, and Obstacles of Conservative Thinking Must be Overcome

    However, to achieve the comprehensive utilization of coal and improve the degree of comprehensive utilization of coal is not without difficulties or obstacles. Difficulties and obstacles will come from two aspects: one is scientific and technological, and the other is ideological.

    There are many scientific and technological problems that need to be solved. For example, after the process of comprehensive utilization of coal is implemented on a national scale, we will have a large amount of low-temperature tar that needs to be processed. At present, other methods of processing low-temperature tar, except for high-pressure hydrogenation, are not mature enough. Another example is that the low-temperature carbonization industry needs to greatly improve the efficiency of the process in order to cooperate with large-scale thermal power plants. Another example is that in order to increase the recovery rate of by-products during coking, more young bituminous coal needs to be used in the production of metallurgical coke. However, how to use more young bituminous coal and ensure the quality of coke also requires a series of scientific and technological problems to be solved.

    Although some of these scientific and technological problems have not been satisfactorily solved internationally, as long as we boost our energy and organize our scientific research forces well under the leadership of the Party, and strengthen scientific research in this area, I firmly believe that through our active efforts and the help of fraternal countries, these problems can be solved.

    Because the comprehensive utilization of coal involves many departments and many technological reforms, conservative thinking will be the main ideological obstacle. To achieve the comprehensive utilization of coal, the close cooperation of all relevant departments is required. When planning and designing, the relevant enterprises should be united and connected with each other so that it becomes an enterprise that makes the best use of everything and has no waste residue.

    However, I believe that conservative thinking will be quickly overcome in the face of the unprecedented high revolutionary enthusiasm of our 600 million people. The contradictions between our various departments can be completely resolved through criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, it is entirely possible for our country to comprehensively achieve "comprehensive utilization of coal."

　　综合利用煤炭　支援工业农业
    张大煜代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”及薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”。我并热烈地拥护中国文字改革委员会所提出的汉语拼音方案草案。
    这次大会是一个迎接社会主义建设高潮的大会。上次大会以来短短几个月中，国内外发生了许多令人鼓舞的事情。党中央适时地提出了争取在今后十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的号召。全国人民已鼓起了极大的革命干劲，正在乘风破浪地迈开我国第二个五年计划的第一步。
    不实行煤的综合利用  就会造成惊人的浪费
    今天我要着重谈的，就是如何充分利用我国丰富的煤炭资源这一有利因素，来解决我国工农业建设中的某些重大问题，也就是如何综合利用煤以支援农业及工业的发展的问题。
    在农业方面，解决我国日益增长的人口的“吃”和“穿”的问题，是我们今后相当长时期内需要十分重视的问题。但是在我国条件下，发展农业遇到耕地少的困难，农业机械化也遇到液体燃料缺乏的困难。遇到这些困难当然不好，但是也好。如果我们以革命者态度来对待这些问题，它将大大促进我国的合成肥料、合成纤维和人造液体燃料等工业。
    这些困难，一方面将大大促进化学工业和人造液体燃料工业，在可以预见的将来，我们将要成为一个高度化学化的国家，化学产品将在我们的衣、食、住、行各个方面都占重要的地位。在另一方面这些困难也将大大促进我国化学、燃料及其他有关的科学技术的发展，将促进我们在这些方面尽早地赶上世界先进的科学水平。
    我们的化学工业及人造液体燃料工业可以大大发展是有根据的，根据就是我国有极其丰富的煤炭资源，和一个无比优越的社会制度，这个制度保证我们能够全面地规划我国的工农业建设，能够在全国范围内综合地利用我国丰富的煤炭资源，来为人民谋福利。综合地利用煤，除了可以供给热量以外，还可提供大量的化学工业原料和人造液体燃料。
    所谓“综合利用”，用我国的老话来说，就是“物尽其用”。我国人民一向是勤劳而俭朴的，在我们的生活中就有很多“综合利用”的例子。譬如农村里烧炕，煮饭时的废热就得到充分的利用。
    煤有许多不同的用法。就举烟煤为例，因为我国烟煤比较多，现在我们绝大部分烟煤都是在家庭的炉子里和工厂的锅炉下烧掉，我们从它直接得到的只是热，除此以外什么也没有了，还弄得满城是煤烟。如果我们不直接把烟煤烧掉，先把它烧成焦，用焦子来烧炉子，这样我们得到热以外，还能得到什么？我们可以把去年民用煤的百分之四十约二千万吨作一个简单的计算，计算的结果是惊人的。我们可以从炼焦时所得的煤气制取约六百万吨的硫氨（用它可以增产约三百六十亿斤粮食）；从炼焦时的轻质油可制约二十万吨粗苯（用它可产约十万吨的合成纤维卡普隆，可制六亿件衬衫）；从焦油中还可得好几十种数以千吨万吨计的化学产品，塑料和药品。
    没有人会愿意把肥料、衣料、塑料、药品等等放在炉内烧掉，但是目前我们许多人家、许多工厂却无形中如此做了，这种无形的浪费真正是惊人的。
    煤的用途是随着科学技术的发展而改变的，过去人类只把它当作燃料，到今天还是我们能量的主要来源。但我们今天已经开始进入了人类征服自然的新纪元，原子能及热核反应能将要成为我们取之不尽、用之不竭的能源，将来煤要成为最珍贵的化学工业原料之一。我们今天正处在一个过渡时期，在这个过渡时期内，煤的利用的特点是既作为燃料也作为化学工业原料。这个时期就是燃料——化学综合利用的时期，我们的工业建设应当符合于这个时期的特点。
    因此无论从解决我国当前国民经济建设中的困难来说，或从科学技术发展的远景来说，煤的综合利用是合乎规律的，亦合乎客观需要的。
    煤的综合利用的几个主要途径
    煤的综合利用途径很多，根据各方面考虑大致有以下几个主要途径：
    （一）对于民用煤，我国煤目前大部分是民用，因此从民用煤可以回收的焦油及煤气可达几百万吨。在大城市里可实行城市煤气化，以部分煤气及半焦作为民用及城市工业用的燃料。这样可以获得制取合成肥料，合成纤维，合成塑料等的原料。同时还可节约城市用煤，节约市内运输，大大改善城市卫生。
    对中小城市及乡村用煤，可以考虑先进行低温或中温干馏。以部分半焦供民用，部分供合成氨用。低温焦油可以加工为液体燃料，并从中提取合成纤维及塑料等的原料。
    （二）对于火力发电厂用煤，也应当考虑低温干馏与电厂的结合问题。从一个十亿度的发电厂就可以回收约五万吨的液体产物，这些可以进一步加工为液体燃料、合成纤维、塑料、杀虫剂、浮选剂、鞣革剂等等。
    （三）目前冶金焦的生产已经具备了初步的综合利用的形式，从炼焦厂我们除了得冶金焦以外，还可得到煤气、高温焦油等产品。这些都可以进一步加工为氮肥、合成纤维等等。目前我国炼焦厂的焦油及煤气等副产收率是相当高的，但是还可以提高的，这里可做的文章还很多。我国钢铁工业将在十五年或者更多一点的时间内赶上或超过英国。十五年后我国将要生产三千多万吨的冶金焦，副产收率方面如粗苯的收率提高千分之一，就可以增产三万多吨的粗苯，从而可做九千万件卡普隆衬衫。
    为了实现煤的综合利用  必须加强科学技术研究  必须克服保守思想障碍
    但是要实现煤的综合利用，提高煤综合利用的程度不是没有困难或障碍。困难和障碍将来自两个方面：一是科学技术上的，一是思想上的。
    在科学技术上需要解决的问题是不少的，譬如在全国范围内实行煤的综合利用的流程以后，我们将有大量的低温焦油需要进行加工，而目前低温焦油的加工，除了用高压加氢外其他方法都还不够成熟。又如低温干馏工业需要大大提高过程的效率，才能和大型火力发电厂相配合。又如为了提高炼焦时副产的收率，需要在冶金焦生产中多用年青的烟煤，但如何多用年青烟煤而又保证焦炭质量，也有一系列的科学技术问题需要解决。
    这些科学技术问题，虽然有一些在国际上还没有满意解决的，只要我们鼓起干劲，把我们的科学研究力量在党的领导下很好地组织起来，加强这方面的科学研究工作，我深信，通过我们积极的努力和兄弟国家的帮助，这些问题都是可以解决的。
    由于煤的综合利用牵涉到许多部门，和许多生产技术上的改革，因此保守思想将是主要的思想障碍。实现煤的综合利用，需要各有关部门的通力合作；在规划和设计的时候，要把有关的企业联合起来，彼此衔接起来，使它成为一个物尽其用没有废渣的企业。
    但是我相信，保守思想在我们六亿人民的革命干劲空前高涨的形势下，将会很快克服。我们各部门之间的矛盾是完全可以通过批评与自我批评来解决的。因此在我国完全有可能全面地实现“煤的综合利用”。
