    Also a Form of Exercise
    Zhao Shulin, People's Bank of Cangshan County, Shandong

    Last year, our county suffered from both floods and droughts, leading to reduced grain production. Under the call of "Planting one more grain is one more grain, planting one more plant yields one more harvest," the comrades within our office formed a labor group and turned over the idle space in the courtyard, planting Chinese cabbage, radishes, and carrots. In total, we harvested two thousand catties. Considering the soil quality of the plots we planted, it was not bad, and the water source was convenient. If these plots were farmed by peasants, the normal income would be half as much as ours. As the saying goes, "Crops won't yield grain without effort and manure." This year, we have readjusted our labor organization, adopting a method of assigning plots to individuals with unified use of accumulated manure, preparing to plant corn or sweet potatoes in the spring.

    The vegetables we grow ourselves are the same vegetables as those bought from the market, but for some reason, we always feel that things that have been worked on by our own hands are better than those bought from the market, and eating them is comfortable and satisfying. Anyone who works for their own food will have this feeling. Most of our labor time is used during leisure time, which also strengthens physical exercise. For some people who do not like activities, it also urges them to move around. More importantly, through labor, we can taste the flavor of labor and know that grain does not come easily.

    Our office only has these few empty plots (about six fen), but through labor, we have gained this harvest. It is understood that there are many institutions with empty plots like ours. If everyone makes use of these empty plots, the harvest will not only be "one grain and one plant," but many grains and many plants. In addition, for those of us who cannot go to the mountains and countryside for the time being (due to work needs or illness and old age), this is also a very good form of exercise.

    也是一种锻炼
    山东苍山人民银行  赵书林
    去年我们县受了水灾和旱灾，粮食减了产，在“多种一粒是一粒，多种一棵收一棵”的号召下，我们机关内的同志编成劳动小组，把院内闲着的空地翻起来，种上了白菜、萝卜、葫萝卜。总共收了二千斤。按我们种的这几块地的土质来说，是不赖，水源又方便，这些地要放在农民手里种，正常收入也要比我们多一半。俗语说：“庄稼不上粮，缺少工夫粪”。我们今年又重新调整了劳动组织，采取了分片包干积粪统一使用的办法，准备开春种上玉米或地瓜。
    我们自己种的菜和从集市上买来的同是一样菜，可是不知为什么，总觉得经自己手劳动的东西比从集市上买来的东西好，吃起来舒适畅快。这点感受凡是自劳自食的人都会有。我们劳动的时间，大部分是利用闲余时间，这样也加强了身体锻炼，对一部分不爱好活动的人来说，也督促了活动，更重要的是通过劳动，才能尝到劳动的味道，知道粮食来的不容易。
    我们机关仅这几块空地（约有六分）经过劳动，得到这点收获。据了解像我们这样有空地的机关单位，还不少，如果大家都把这些空地利用起来，所得的收获那不仅是“一粒一棵”，而是多粒多棵的了。这样做另外对我们这些暂时不能上山下乡的人（因工作需要或病老）来说，也是一种很好的锻炼。
