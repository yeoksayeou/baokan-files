Shaanxi Rural Curiosities

　　Fish Lake in the Desert

　　The “Hongjiannao Hai Zi” (Red Goose Lake) within the territory of Shenmu County in northern Shaanxi, was found after a survey last year to be rich in freshwater fish. Whenever a strong wind blows, large fish weighing several pounds often jump ashore. Locals say that there are carp weighing hundreds of pounds in the lake, and the output is very large.

　　“There are many wild ducks on the lakeside. Every year during the wild duck egg-laying season, you can pick up a large basket of wild duck eggs after walking a short distance along the lake. The eggs taste delicious.

　　The Shaanxi Provincial Aquatic Products Department has now planned to develop the lake's fish production.

　　Wild Kudzu for Weaving

　　Kudzu is a wild plant that grows everywhere in the barren hills, old dams, roadsides, and riverbanks of Pingli County in southern Shaanxi. Its fiber can be used to weave cloth. The kudzu cloth woven is strong and durable, with a light yellow color, and is beautiful without dyeing. According to preliminary investigations, Pingli County produces approximately 25 million jin of kudzu annually, which can be made into 1.5 million jin of fiber, equivalent to the cotton produced by 300,000 mu of cotton fields.

　　Pingli County will soon build a kudzu textile factory.

　　Insect Sugar

　　In the rural areas of Zhangjiapan and Liuguiwan in Jingbian, northern Shaanxi, a type of sugar is made using the secretions of an insect. Locals call this sugar insect sugar. The taste and color of insect sugar are the same as ordinary brown sugar.

　　This small insect that secretes sugary liquid lives on willow trees. It is called the “oil sweat insect”, is about the size of a broad bean, and is dark red. It is most abundant in July and August each year, and it resides on the branches of willow trees without moving. At this time, there is a white sticky secretion on the branches and leaves below it, which farmers call "oil sweat feces," which is the raw material for making sugar. Under the trees with the most insects, this sticky substance often flows to the ground and solidifies into a thick layer. (Xinhua News Agency)

    陕西农村珍闻
    沙漠里的鱼湖
    陕北神木县境内的“红碱淖海子”，经去年勘察，发现盛产淡水鱼类。每遇大风吹来，常有几斤重的大鱼随风跃上岸来。当地人民谈，湖内有几百斤重的鲤鱼，并且产量很大。
    “湖边野鸭很多，每年在野鸭产蛋期间，只要沿着湖边走不远就可以拣回一大筐野鸭蛋，蛋味鲜美。
    现在，陕西省水产部门已经规划开发这个湖的鱼产。
    可织布的野葛麻
    葛麻是遍生于陕南平利县荒山老坝和路旁河边的一种野生植物。它的纤维可以织布，织成的葛布结实耐用，色地浅黄，不用印染就很漂亮。据初步调查，平利县每年产葛麻约两千五百万斤，可制成一百五十万斤纤维，相当于三十万亩棉田所产棉花。
    平利县在最近将兴建一座葛麻纺织工厂。
    虫糖
    陕北靖边张家畔、柳桂湾一带农村利用一种虫子的分泌物来熬糖。当地人把这种糖叫作虫糖。虫糖的滋味、色泽和普通红糖一样。
    这种分泌糖液的小昆虫寄居在柳树上，称为油汗虫，约有扁豆大小，呈黑红色，每年7、8月最多，栖息在柳树枝上，不走动。在它下边的枝叶上这时候就有一种白色的粘状分泌物，农民们称为油汗屎，这便是熬糖的原料。在虫子最多的树下，这种粘状物往往流到地面上，凝聚成厚厚的一层。　（新华社）
