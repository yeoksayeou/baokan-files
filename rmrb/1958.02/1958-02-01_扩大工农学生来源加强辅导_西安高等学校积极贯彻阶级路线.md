Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 31st: Shaanxi Province's universities and colleges are actively implementing the policy of opening doors to workers and peasants during rectification, expanding the sources of worker-peasant student enrollment, and strengthening tutoring for worker-peasant students. At present, various institutions are preparing to establish worker-peasant middle schools and worker-peasant classes based on specific conditions, and those that were established in the past but were discontinued midway are also being prepared for restoration. The Xi'an Institute of Architectural Engineering is also preparing to compile separate teaching plans and textbooks for the worker-peasant class students to be opened separately next semester, and to equip experienced teachers to undertake the teaching and tutoring work of this class. Jiaotong University has specially set up a question-and-answer room for worker-peasant students. Northwest Agricultural College is preparing to run a training course for veteran cadres, absorbing veteran cadres tempered by revolutionary struggles to participate in learning, so that they can reach the level of university graduation in several major courses in two years.

In terms of enrollment, various schools will also change the past situation of giving too much emphasis on test scores, neglecting political quality, and setting up examination areas mostly in large cities when recruiting new students. In the future, in addition to facing factories, rural areas, old revolutionary base areas, and small and medium-sized cities for enrollment, the Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts will also implement a method of first testing political courses and then testing professional courses during examinations. It is planned that by 1962, worker-peasant students in school will account for 80% of the total number of students.

Some schools have also appropriately raised and expanded the standards and coverage of scholarships for worker-peasant students, and reduced scholarships for general non-worker-peasant students.

Since liberation, the proportion of worker-peasant students in Xi'an's universities and colleges has increased year by year, and currently accounts for about 40% of the total number of students in each school. However, during the recent rectification and great debate in various schools, it was revealed that many leading cadres and some teachers had ideas of despising workers and peasants, and did not give enough care and help in study and life according to the characteristics of worker-peasant students' poor cultural foundation and the heavy burden of general families, which made some worker-peasant students in school unable to overcome learning difficulties and repeat grades or drop out. During the rectification, all schools conducted debates based on the above opinions and studied and formulated measures to continue implementing the class line.

　　扩大工农学生来源加强辅导
    西安高等学校积极贯彻阶级路线
    据新华社西安31日电　陕西省各高等学校在整改中积极贯彻向工农开门的方针，扩大工农学生来源，加强对工农学生的辅导等工作。目前各院校正准备根据具体条件，增设工农中学和工农班，过去设立而中途停止的也准备恢复起来。西安建筑工程学院还准备为下学期单独开设的工农班学生另编教学计划和教材，并且配备有经验的教师担任这个班的教学和辅导工作。交通大学专门为工农学生设立了答疑室。西北农学院准备举办老干部进修班，吸收经过革命斗争锻炼的老干部参加学习，使他们以两年时间在几门主要课程方面达到大学毕业的水平。
    在招生工作方面，各学校也要改变过去录取新生偏重考试分数忽视政治质量和考区多设在大城市的情况。西安美术专科学校今后招生除了面向工厂、农村、老区和中小城市外，在考试时，还将实行先考试政治课，再考试专业课的办法，计划到1962年时，在校的工农学生将占到学生总数的80％。
    有些学校还适当提高和扩大工农学生助学金的标准和享受面，减少一般非工农成份学生的助学金。
    解放后，西安各高等学校工农学生比重逐年增加，目前约占各校学生总数40％左右。但是，在最近各个学校整改大辩论中，揭露了不少领导干部和一些教师存在着轻视工农的思想，没有根据工农学生文化基础差、一般家庭负担重等特点在学习和生活上给以足够的关怀和帮助，使有些在校工农学生因学习困难无法克服而留级或退学。整改中各学校都根据上述意见，进行了辩论，研究制定了继续贯彻阶级路线的措施。
