　　The Whole Year's Work Depends on a Good Start in Spring: Sichuan Is Busy Preparing for Spring Farming
　　Chengdu, February 8th. As the Beginning of Spring has just passed, the earth is reviving, and the Sichuan Basin is tensely preparing for spring plowing.

　　In Yibin, Luzhou in the south of the basin, and Jiangjin, Neijiang and other areas in the central region where the season starts earlier, spring plowing has already begun. Even in the Daxian, Nanchong, and Mianyang regions in the north where the season is later, and in the Chengdu Plain where the temperature is lower, preparations for spring plowing have also begun. In Xichong County, the weather is colder and cattle cannot go into the water, but under the leadership of cadres at all levels, the masses have generally started digging paddy fields and preparing to sow early rice.

　　The province's work on building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and improving the soil is now continuing to expand its achievements. A labor army of more than 20 million people has been fighting for nearly two months, expanding the irrigated area by 7.09 million mu. The province's plan to increase the irrigated area is expected to be completed more than double the original target, and the progress of the project is unprecedentedly rapid. In the past month or so, Fushun County has completed irrigation of more than 320,000 mu. Within the most recent week, the county will achieve water conservancy. Throughout the province, more than 6.33 million mu of land has been processed and improved, exceeding the original soil improvement plan by 67%. The province has completed soil and water conservation work on an area of ​​4.16 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 38.6%. A total of 286.9 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated in various places, with an average of 2,428 jin of fertilizer applied per mu. The number of pigs raised throughout the province has increased by 50% compared with the same period last year.

　　Various departments are actively supporting spring plowing. The grain department has collected more than 25 million jin of various high-quality rice seeds and more than 14 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds from various places outside the province. Other high-quality seeds such as sugar beets and flax are also steadily entering Sichuan. This year, the various chemical fertilizers produced by the local fertilizer industry will increase by more than 85% compared with last year. As a result of supply and marketing cooperatives tapping potential and finding sources of goods from all aspects, although the overall supply of commercial fertilizers is very scarce, the total supply this year is expected to increase by 7.52% compared with last year. By the end of January, more than 25,000 tons of phosphate rock powder had begun to be supplied to grassroots cooperatives in various places. The supply of various pesticides and machinery this year has increased by 24% to 84.46% compared with last year. The supply and marketing cooperatives will help farmers adjust more than 95,000 head of draught cattle. In terms of production funds, the local People's Banks have done a good job in recovering old loans, so the funds that can be loaned this year are relatively abundant. In addition, the total amount of loans that can be issued by credit cooperatives throughout the province will be doubled compared with last year. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have also widely mobilized the masses to invest. The Neijiang area originally planned to organize members to invest 6 million yuan, and has now collected it all.

　　一年之计在于春  四川备耕农事忙
    本报成都8日电　立春刚过，大地回春，四川盆地紧张地迎接春耕。
    盆地南部宜宾、泸州及中部江津、内江等季节较早的地区，春耕工作早已动手。就连北部季节较晚的达县、南充、绵阳专区和气温较低的成都平原，春耕准备工作也都已经开始。西充县天气较冷，牛不能下水，但群众在各级干部的带动下，也普遍展开了挖水田、准备播种早稻的活动。
    全省兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤的工作，现正继续扩大战果。二千多万人的劳动大军，已经战斗近两个月，扩大灌溉面积七百零九万亩。全省增加灌溉面积的计划，预计即将超额一倍完成，工程进展之迅速空前未有。富顺县近一个多月，已完成灌溉面积三十二万多亩。在最近一周内，全县将实现水利化。经过加工改良的土地，全省已达六百三十三万多亩，已超额67％完成原订土壤改良计划。全省已完成水土保持面积四百一十六万亩，超过原计划38.6％。各地积肥共达二千八百六十九亿斤，平均每亩已可施肥二千四百二十八斤。全省养猪数已比去年同期上升50％。
    各部门积极支援春耕，粮食部门已从省外各地搜集了各种水稻良种二千五百多万斤，棉花良种一千四百多万斤，其他如甜菜、亚麻等良种，亦在源源入川。地方肥料工业今年生产的各种化学肥料，将比去年增加85％以上。供销合作系统从各方面挖潜力、找货源的结果，虽然整个商品肥料很缺，但今年预计总的供应量还可比去年增加7.52％。到1月底止，已有二万五千多吨磷矿粉在各地基层社开始供应。各种农药械今年的供应量比去年增加24％到84.46％。供销社将帮助农民调剂耕牛九万五千多头。在生产资金方面，各地人民银行收回旧贷的工作作得较好，今年可以贷放的资金就比较充裕，加上全省信用社可以发放的贷款额，总数将比去年增加一倍。各地农业社也广泛发动群众投资，内江地区原计划组织社员投资六百万元，现已集齐。
