　　Hospitals Have Great Potential for Saving Food
    The waste of staple food by patients in hospitals is significant. The main reasons for this waste are: (1) Catering staff and ward food distribution personnel generally have the mindset of being generous rather than frugal; (2) Some patients believe that since they are paying for their meals, they do not cherish food, sometimes taking more than they can eat and leaving the rest to be wasted.
    In order to plug the loopholes in food waste, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College implemented a "semi-cafeteria system" starting from November 6th last year. This method mainly fixes the amount of staple food and non-staple food needed by patients, with refunds for surplus staple food and charges for shortages (separate charges for staple food). As a result of implementation, an average of more than 50 catties of grain can be saved per day. From January to October last year, the hospital handed in an average monthly surplus of more than 460 catties of grain. After the implementation of the "semi-cafeteria system," it handed in more than 1,600 catties of grain in November and more than 1,900 catties of grain in December. From these figures, the implementation of a quantitative supply of staple food for patients is the key to eliminating food waste in every hospital.
    In addition, I believe that after a patient is hospitalized, the hospital should collect grain ration tickets according to the patient's original standard grain ration because the patient's food intake is generally less than that of a healthy person, and those extra grain ration tickets should be brought to the hospital and handed in uniformly by the hospital, rather than being left at home. If every hospital in the country could do this, the amount would be significant.　　　　　　Qu Huiqing

### 医院节约粮食的潜力很大

　　医院节约粮食的潜力很大
    医院里病员主食的浪费很大，造成浪费的原因主要有两个：（一）炊事员同志和病房配膳人员，一般都存在宽打窄用的思想；（二）有的病员认为自己花钱吃饭，很不爱惜粮食，有时要的多，吃不完就剩下让它浪费。
    北京医学院第二附属医院为了堵塞粮食浪费的漏洞，从去年11月6日起实行了“半食堂制”。这种办法主要将病员所需的主食量和副食固定下来，主食多退少补（另收主食费）。实行的结果，每天平均可节约五十多斤粮食。该院从去年1月至10月平均每月上缴余粮四百六十多斤，实行“半食堂制”以后，11月份一个月就上缴余粮一千六百多斤，12月份上缴一千九百多斤。从这些数字来看，对病员所需的主食量实行定量供应是每个医院杜绝粮食浪费现象的关键。
    另外，我认为病员住院以后，医院应当按照病员本人原来的食粮定量标准收粮票，因为病员的食量一般比好人少，而那些多余的粮票就应当带到医院来，由医院统一上缴，不应当留在家里。如果全国每一个医院都能这样做，这笔数字是很大的。　　　　　　区慧清
