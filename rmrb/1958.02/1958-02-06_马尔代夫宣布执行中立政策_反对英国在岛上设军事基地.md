Xinhua News Agency, February 5th, Colombo Dispatch: The Maldives government delegation said in Colombo on the 4th that many residents of the Maldives Islands oppose the establishment of an air force base by the British on their islands. The Maldives government delegation is in Colombo negotiating with the British High Commissioner on the new base on Gan Island, including the resettlement of the island's eight hundred residents. The government delegation said that they are currently studying a draft agreement, and if it is not suitable, they will reject it and demand that the British leave.

According to the "Ceylon Daily News," the new government of the Maldives Islands, led by Ibrahim Nasir, declared that it is determined to pursue a neutral policy like that pursued by India and Ceylon.

It is known that this former British colony located in the Indian Ocean southwest of Ceylon declared itself an "independent republic" within the Commonwealth in 1953. The Maldives Islands play an important role in ensuring aviation links between Britain and Australia, New Zealand, and its possessions in the Far East. Britain attempted to maintain control over the islands and supported the former Ali Didi puppet regime, and obtained the Didi government's consent to establish British military bases on the islands.

The "Ceylon Daily News" said that in order to protest this move by the authorities, the islanders overthrew the pro-British Didi government and demanded a change in the agreement signed with Britain regarding the establishment of military bases.

### 马尔代夫宣布执行中立政策  反对英国在岛上设军事基地

　　马尔代夫宣布执行中立政策
    反对英国在岛上设军事基地
    据新华社5日讯　科伦坡消息：马尔代夫政府使团4日在科伦坡说，马尔代夫群岛的许多居民反对英国在他们的岛屿上建立空军基地。马尔代夫政府使团正在科伦坡同英国高级专员谈判关于在甘岛的新基地的问题，包括重新安置这个岛上的八百居民的问题。政府使团说，他们现在正在研究一个协定草案，如果它不合适，他们将会拒绝它，并且要求英国离开。
    据“锡兰之光报”报道，由易卜拉欣·纳赛尔领导的马尔代夫群岛的新政府声明，它决心执行像印度、锡兰所执行的那种中立政策。
    大家知道，这个位于锡兰西南的印度洋上的前英国殖民地已经在1953年宣布为英联邦内的一个“独立的共和国”。马尔代夫群岛在保证英国同澳大利亚、新西兰和它在远东的属地的航空联系上起着重要作用。英国企图保持对群岛的控制，便扶植了前阿里·戴迪傀儡政权，并且取得戴迪政府的同意在岛上建立英国的军事基地。
    “锡兰之光报”说，为了抗议当局的这种举动，岛上居民推翻了亲英的戴迪政府，并且要求改变同英国签订的关于建立军事基地的协定。
