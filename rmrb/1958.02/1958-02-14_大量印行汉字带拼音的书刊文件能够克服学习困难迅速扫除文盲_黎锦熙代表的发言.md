I completely agree with the four reports by Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Vice Chairman Peng, and Director Wu. Now, regarding what Vice Premier Bo said in the "Draft National Economic Plan for 1958" under the section on culture and education, "To ensure the basic elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people within the next ten years, we must vigorously carry out the movement to eliminate illiteracy," and what Director Wu said in the "Report on Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme," "The main purpose of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to annotate Chinese characters and spell Mandarin Chinese, to help literacy, unify pronunciation, and teach Mandarin Chinese, aiming to facilitate the learning and use of Chinese characters by the broad masses of people," "It can first be used to annotate the primary school Chinese textbooks and literacy textbooks in the Northern dialect area," "Children and illiterate people who are just learning to read can rely on the phonetic alphabet to read newspapers and further recognize more Chinese characters;" "We should vigorously promote the learning of Mandarin Chinese among cadres, especially local cadres at the district level and above and young cadres. On the other hand, because dialects still play an important role in local activities, foreign cadres should also actively learn local dialects in order to closely connect with the masses and do a good job": Combining these words, I would like to express some opinions on the use of the phonetic alphabet to help eliminate illiteracy, the promotion of Mandarin Chinese among the broad masses of people, and the attitude towards local dialects in local activities.

Simplifying Chinese characters halves the writing effort, which is welcomed by the broad masses; internationalizing Chinese character annotation is correct and timely.

Simplifying Chinese characters can save half the writing effort, so it is warmly welcomed by the broad masses, especially children. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme further helps by annotating the pronunciation of Chinese characters, and at the same time, it combines Mandarin Chinese (Beijing standard pronunciation) to annotate the unified pronunciation for the whole country, which takes over and develops the function of the phonetic symbols of the past forty years. The phonetic alphabet scheme uses Latin letters, which will be popularized to 600 million people across the country, and worldwide, there are more than sixty countries using Latin letters, with a population of over 600 million, which makes it possible for people familiar with this form of writing to reach more than half of the world's population. This is very beneficial to the cultural exchange between the people of all countries, and it is in line with socialist internationalism. We are "internationalizing" the form of national letters while simultaneously "nationalizing" the function of international letters. Director Wu also mentioned in his report, "Latin letters are widely used in science and technology, have many uses, and many opportunities to come into contact with them, so they are not easily forgotten. If phonetic symbols are used, middle school students still have to learn Latin letters; if Latin letters are used, there is no need to learn phonetic symbols again." In order to simplify the learning of letters for the new generations of 600 million people, arrangements should be made now to internationalize the letters used to annotate Chinese characters as soon as possible, and at the same time, Latin letters can be "nationalized" to serve Chinese characters and the Chinese language, and to serve the languages ​​and scripts of all ethnic groups in the country. Therefore, it is correct and timely to use Latin letters to replace phonetic symbols now. Although the two have their own difficulties in initial learning and their own strengths and weaknesses in Chinese phonetics, we should not haggle over the long-term prospects of language reform; those who are just learning can complete the task in one go with a surge of effort.

Widely print Chinese characters with Pinyin in books and documents, so that it can penetrate into people's lives and daily work, and create an environment for learning the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese as quickly as possible.

The purpose of formulating the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is currently only to facilitate the learning and use of Chinese characters by the broad masses of people, not to replace Chinese characters, because Chinese characters are still in use in Chinese society. Therefore, to ensure the basic elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people within the next ten years, the question is how to closely combine the phonetic alphabet with Chinese characters, so that the phonetic alphabet can indeed help the learning and application of Chinese characters, that is, it can indeed be used to control and standardize the pronunciation of Chinese characters, overcome the difficulties of learning Chinese characters, shorten the learning period, and quickly eliminate illiteracy. Based on my decades of experience in language reform work, I would like to introduce a method that I personally believe is effective, which is to widely and massively print general books and documents with Chinese characters with Pinyin, especially important documents that are currently being studied and that everyone must read, such as the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China," the forty articles of the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program," and so on. In this way, the phonetic alphabet and Chinese characters are closely combined, not only in primary school Chinese textbooks and literacy textbooks, nor only in children's books, comic strips, and popular newspapers and periodicals, but in order to allow this important printed matter to penetrate and popularize into all aspects of the daily life and central work of the people, so that the general working masses and cadres at all levels who are busy with work can easily access the combination of the phonetic alphabet and Chinese characters in different working environments. In fact, it is fine to just look at the Chinese characters, because the Chinese characters are already familiar; it is fine to occasionally look for the phonetic annotation, because this is an uncommon and error-prone character or they are afraid of not pronouncing the character accurately; it is fine to read the Pinyin only, because they are not familiar with all the Chinese characters, so they may as well "read the book first, then learn the characters." People with different cultural levels gather at a conference table or in a meeting place, spread out the documents, and take what they need; they do not have to go to a time and place for studying Pinyin or practicing Mandarin Chinese to see the phonetic alphabet in writing. This can create an environment for learning the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese as quickly as possible, and establish it deeply and universally, so that people who are too busy with work will no longer feel that learning the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese is another burden. Of course, general publicity, promotion, and teacher training for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme are also necessary, and the government leadership should have a detailed and appropriate plan; there is also the issue of teaching methods for primary school Chinese textbooks to start learning the phonetic alphabet, which should have a "Great Leap Forward" design, which remains to be discussed; furthermore, the method I introduced of printing general books and documents with Chinese characters with phonetic annotations, which used to be called "phonetic annotated Chinese characters," is now annotated with the phonetic alphabet, and the printing technology also needs to be studied.

In rural areas, as long as the phonetic alphabet is universally learned, the literacy movement and the promotion of Mandarin Chinese can be combined; foreign cadres should learn the local language, and local people should learn Mandarin Chinese. It is not difficult to learn through comparative study of the phonetic alphabet.

In the vast rural areas, local dialects still play an important role in local activities, which is the current reality and also a problem that the language reform movement has failed to completely solve over the past decades. Now, as long as the books and documents that everyone must read are widely and massively distributed in print with Chinese characters with Pinyin, a standard of unified pronunciation can be established in writing. Because the situation in rural areas is no longer what it was in the past, listening to the central radio broadcasts, listening to the reports conveyed by foreign cadres, and more recently, the joint labor of cadres and students who have been sent down to the countryside, everyone is exposed to Mandarin Chinese, which is consistent with the standard of these books and documents with Chinese characters and Pinyin; as long as the phonetic alphabet is universally learned, the literacy movement to eliminate illiteracy and the movement to promote Mandarin Chinese can basically be combined with each other. On the other hand, foreign cadres must strive to learn the local dialect, or local people (which may also include foreign cadres) must quickly and economically switch from their own respective dialects to the nationally unified Mandarin Chinese, to learn or understand, they must also rely on the phonetic alphabet to individually and systematically compare the pronunciation of the dialect and the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese on this kind of books and documents with Chinese characters and Pinyin, and gradually practice, Mandarin Chinese can be learned, and the local dialect is not difficult to learn either. Originally, the promotion of Mandarin Chinese is not to force everyone to speak it in every occasion, but to require everyone to be able to speak it in any region; it is not hoped that everyone can speak it beautifully, but to require everyone to be able to speak and understand it. As long as one can recite or read aloud general vernacular books and documents according to the Beijing standard pronunciation, this person has obtained a guarantee that the level of Mandarin Chinese has reached this standard. Therefore, books and documents with Chinese characters and Pinyin can not only help literacy, overcome difficulties, shorten the learning period, and accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, but also strengthen the unity and development of national languages ​​and related aspects.

In general, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has adopted a mass communication tool suitable for the new era in social life and cultural and educational work, which can help the people of the whole country strengthen and accelerate the pace and speed of progress on the road of socialist construction. I recommend that the conference approve it!

    大量印行汉字带拼音的书刊文件能够克服学习困难迅速扫除文盲
    黎锦熙代表的发言
    我完全同意李副总理、薄副总理、彭副委员长和吴主任的四个报告。现在，我就着薄副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”中文化教育项下所说的“保证在今后十年内基本上扫除青年和壮年中的文盲，必须大力开展扫除文盲的运动”，和吴主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”中所说的“汉语拼音方案的主要用途是给汉字注音和拼写普通话，以帮助识字、统一读音和教学普通话，目的在于便利广大人民的学习和使用汉字”，“首先可以用来在小学语文课本和北方话区的扫盲课本上注音”，“初学文字的儿童和文盲，就可以依靠拼音字母来阅读书报，并且进一步认识更多汉字”；“应该在干部中，特别是区以上各级地方干部和青年干部中，大力提倡学习普通话。在另一方面，由于方言在地方性活动中仍然起着重要的作用，外来干部还应当积极学习当地的方言，以便密切联系群众，做好工作”：把这些话结合起来，对于利用拼音字母来帮助扫除文盲问题以及在广大人民中推广普通话和在地方性活动中对待当地方言的问题，发表一点意见。
    简化汉字写来省力一半，广大群众表示欢迎；汉字注音国际化，正确而及时。
    简化汉字写起来可以省力一半，因此受到广大群众特别是少年儿童的热烈欢迎。汉语拼音方案又对汉字来个注明读音的帮助，同时结合了普通话（北京标准音）来注明全国统一的读音，这就把四十多年来的注音字母的功用接替过来，发展下去。拼音方案采用了拉丁字母，将要普及于全国六万万人民，而在全世界范围内，用拉丁字母的六十多个国家，人口也超过了六万万，这就有可能使熟悉这种文字面貌的人，达到全世界人口的过半数。这对于各国人民的文化交流是非常有利的，是符合于社会主义的国际主义的。我们把民族字母的形式“国际化”，同时就是把国际字母的功用“民族化”。吴主任在报告中也提到，“拉丁字母在科学技术上普遍使用，用处多，接触机会多，学了不容易忘记。采用注音字母，一般中学生仍旧要学拉丁字母；采用拉丁字母，却不必再学注音字母。”为了六万万人将来新生的几代精简一次字母的学习，现在就该作出安排，把目前给汉字注音的字母趁早国际化起来，同时就可使拉丁字母“民族化”起来，为汉字汉语服务，为国内各兄弟民族的语言文字服务。所以现在拿拉丁字母来接替注音字母，是正确的，适时的。虽然这两者在初步学习上各有难易，在汉语拼音上也互有短长，但我们正视着文字改革的远景前程，就不必斤斤计较；初步学习的，只要一鼓起干劲来，就可以一气呵成，完全学会的。
    广泛印行汉字带拼音的书刊文件，使之深入到人民生活和日常工作中去，可以尽先尽快地创造出学习拼音字母和普通话的环境。
    汉语拼音方案制定的目的，目前只在于便利广大人民的学习和使用汉字，并非用来代替汉字，这是因为目前中国社会上还在通行着汉字。因此，要保证在今后十年内基本扫除青年和壮年中的文盲，问题就在于怎样把拼音字母和汉字紧密地结合起来，让拼音字母确实能够帮助汉字的学习和运用，就是说，确实能够用来控制和规范汉字的读音，克服学习汉字的困难，缩短学习期限，迅速扫除文盲。我且凭几十年来搞文字改革工作的经验总结，介绍个人认为有效的一种办法来，就是广泛地大量地印行汉字带拼音的一般书刊文件，尤其是正在展开学习、人人必读的重要文件，例如“中华人民共和国宪法”、“全国农业发展纲要修正草案”四十条等等。就这样把拼音字母和汉字紧密地结合起来，不仅仅结合在小学语文课本和扫盲课本中，也不仅仅结合在儿童读物、连环图画和通俗报刊中，为的是要让这种印刷体才的重要书刊文件深入并普及到任何方面人民群众的日常生活和中心工作中去，让一般忙于工作的工农大众和各级干部在不同的工作环境中都易于接触到拼音字母和汉字结合的东西，实际上，只看汉字也好，因为汉字已经熟识了；偶寻注音也好，因为这是个冷僻易错的字或者怕字音读得不准；专读拼音也好，因为汉字还没有都熟识，就不妨“先读书，后识字”。文化水平不同的人们集合在一张会议桌子或者一个会场里，摊开文件，各取所需；不一定要到研究拼音或练习普通话的时间和场合才能在书面上见到拼音字母。这就可以把学习拼音字母和普通话的环境尽先尽快地创造出来，深入而普及地树立起来，让工作太忙的人们再不会感觉到学习拼音字母和普通话是另一种负担。当然，对于汉语拼音方案的一般宣传、推广和师资培养等等工作也都是必要的，政府领导方面当有周详妥当的计划；还有小学语文课本开始学习拼音字母的教学方法问题，应当来个“大跃进”的设计，还待讨论；再说，我所介绍的这个用汉字带注音印行一般书刊文件的办法，过去叫做“注音汉字”，现在改用拼音字母注音，在印刷技术上也还要加以研究的。
    在农村中只要普遍学会拼音字母，识字运动和推广普通话都可以结合进行；外来干部要学本地话，当地群众要学普通话，通过拼音字母对照学习，都不难学会。
    在广大的农村中，地方性活动仍然是方言起着重要的作用，这是目前的事实，也是几十年来搞文字改革运动的未能完全解决的问题。现在，只要把人人必读的书刊文件，用汉字带拼音的印刷品广泛地大量地传布起来，就可在书面上树立着统一读音的标准。因为农村中已经不是往年的现象，听中央的广播，听外来干部的传达报告，最近更有下放的干部学生们的共同劳动，大家都在耳边厢接触到普通话，跟这汉字带拼音的书刊文件标准是一致的；只要普遍学会了拼音字母，扫除文盲的识字运动和推广普通话运动，基本上是可以互相结合的。另一方面，外来干部要努力学习当地方言，或者是当地群众（也可包括外来干部）要从自己各别的方言又快又省地进入全国一致普通话，学会或者听懂，也得依靠拼音字母在这种汉字带拼音的书刊文件上把方言的读音和普通话的读音个别地并且系统地对照起来，逐步练习，普通话可以学会，当地方言也不难学会。本来普通话的推广，并不是强迫人人在任何场合都必须说，可是要求人人在任何地区都能够说；不是希望人人都能够说得很漂亮，可是要求人人都能说得出、听得懂。只要能够照北京标准音朗诵或宣读一般白话的书刊文件，这个人的普通话就获得了达到这种水平的保证了。因此，汉字带拼音的书刊文件，不但可以帮助识字，克服困难，缩短学习期限，加快扫除文盲，并且可以加强民族语言以及有关方面的统一和发展。
    总的说来，汉语拼音方案是在社会生活和文教工作方面采定了一种适合新时代的大众传达工具，可以帮助全国人民在社会主义建设的道路上加强加快前进的力量和速度。我建议大会予以批准！
