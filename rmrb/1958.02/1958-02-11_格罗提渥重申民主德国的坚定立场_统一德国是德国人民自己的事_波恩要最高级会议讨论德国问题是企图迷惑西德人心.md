Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th. According to a report by the German News Agency (ADN) in Berlin on February 8th: The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, spoke about the issue of holding an East-West summit and German reunification on February 7th when he met with Jacques J. Marie, a reporter from Agence France-Presse.

Marie asked whether, if a summit were held, it would be necessary for the meeting to discuss the reunification of Germany. Grotewohl said that the summit first needs to discuss the major issue of disarmament, which is of concern to the whole world. If this major issue can be resolved, then the resolution of the German question will be closer. Grotewohl pointed out that the Bonn government's suggestion to make the German question the central topic of the summit is only intended to deceive the people of West Germany.

Grotewohl emphasized that the reunification of Germany is a matter for the German people themselves. The GDR firmly believes that the divided state of Germany will not last long, and the German people will eventually achieve the reunification of Germany. We propose establishing a confederation to bring the two Germanys closer together.

Grotewohl said that the German Democratic Republic opposes the establishment of any atomic armaments. It advocates the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and calls for a nationwide referendum on this issue throughout Germany. He said that the GDR has only one condition for the reunification of Germany, and that is to eliminate the threat of war, so that a reunified Germany can become a peace-loving and democratic country where militarists and fascists cannot find a place to live.

    新华社9日讯　据德意志通讯社柏林8日讯：德意志民主和共国总理格罗提渥7日在接见法新社记者雅克·让马里时谈到了有关举行东西方最高级会议和德国统一的问题。
    让马里问如果召开最高级会议，这个会议是否需要讨论德国重新统一的问题。格罗提渥说，最高级会议首先需要讨论的是举世关心的关于裁军的大问题。如果能够解决这个大问题，那么德国问题的解决就较为接近了。格罗提渥指出，波恩政府建议把德国问题作为最高级会议的中心议题，这只是为了要迷惑西德的人民。
    格罗提渥强调，德国重新统一是德国人民自己的事情。民主德国坚决认为，德国的分裂状态是不会长久下去的，德国人民终久会获致德国的重新统一。我们建议建立一个邦联，使两个德国互相接近。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国反对建立任何原子军备，它主张建立一个无原子武器区，并且就这个问题在全德举行全民投票。他说，民主德国对于德国重新统一只有一个条件，那就是消除战争威胁，使重新统一后的德国能够成为军国主义者和法西斯分子无法容身的爱好和平的民主国家。
