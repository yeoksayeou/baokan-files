Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 26th: The General Delegation of the Chinese People's慰问 Group to Korea held a慰问 rally this afternoon at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. When Wang Yifu, head of the General Delegation; Rong Yiren and Wu Tao, deputy heads of the General Delegation; and representatives of the慰问 Group, accompanied by General Yang Yong, commander of the Volunteers, and General Wang Ping, political commissar, ascended the rostrum, thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue.
　　General Wang Ping said in his speech that the慰问 Group brought the concern and boundless love of the people of the motherland for their children who are far away from home. Our motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds, and when we rejoice in every achievement of the motherland's construction, we feel even more responsible.
　　General Wang Ping said that the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to withdraw completely from Korea in batches before the end of 1958. This action marks the victorious conclusion of the historical task entrusted to the Volunteers by the people of the motherland in the more than seven years of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. We, together with the Korean people, have achieved victory in the war and defended peace in the Far East and the world. This achievement is inseparable from the assistance and encouragement of the people of the motherland.
　　Wang Yifu, head of the General Delegation, said in his慰问 speech that the people of the motherland are always concerned about and thinking of the most beloved people who are far away from the motherland guarding the front lines in Korea—the Chinese People's Volunteers. Through your more than seven years of struggle, you have victoriously completed the sacred mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. The immortal feats you have established for the people of the motherland, for the Korean people, and for world peace will never be forgotten by the people of the motherland.
　　After Wang Yifu, head of the General Delegation, outlined the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction in recent years, he continued, "Every achievement of the motherland is closely related to your heroic struggle. The people of the motherland hope that before you withdraw from Korea, you will continue to maintain vigilance, consolidate your fighting will, and at the same time humbly learn from the hardworking Korean people and the heroic Korean People's Army, and continuously enhance friendship and unity with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army."
　　At the meeting, the General Delegation presented the Volunteers' headquarters with a banner and gifts. After the meeting, the PLA Navy Art Troupe, which accompanied the慰问 Group to Korea, gave a慰问 performance.

    新华社平壤26日电　中国人民赴朝慰问团总团今天下午在中国人民志愿军总部举行慰问大会。当慰问团总团长王一夫，副总团长荣毅仁、吴涛和慰问团代表在志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将等陪同下登上主席台时，全场响起了春雷般的掌声。

    王平上将说，中国人民志愿军决定于1958年底以前全部分批撤出朝鲜，这一行动标志着志愿军在七年多抗美援朝斗争中完成了祖国人民的托咐，即将胜利结束这一历史任务。我们与朝鲜人民一起取得了战争的胜利，保卫了远东及世界和平，这一成就是同祖国人民的援助和鼓舞分不开的。
    王一夫总团长在大会上致慰问词说，祖国人民无时无刻不在关怀着和挂念着远离祖国守卫在朝鲜前线的最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。经过你们七年多的斗争，胜利完成了抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣使命。你们为了祖国人民，为了朝鲜人民，为了世界和平所建立的不朽功勋，是祖国人民永远不能忘记的。
    王一夫总团长在概述了几年来祖国社会主义建设的伟大成就以后接着说，祖国的每一项成就，都和你们的英勇斗争密切关联着。祖国人民希望你们在撤离朝鲜以前，继续保持警惕性，巩固战斗意志，同时要虚心地学习勤劳的朝鲜人民和英勇的朝鲜人民军，不断地增进与朝鲜人民以及朝鲜人民军的友谊和团结。
    会上，慰问团总团向志愿军总部献了锦旗和礼品。大会结束后，随同慰问团赴朝的解放军海军文工团进行了慰问演出。
