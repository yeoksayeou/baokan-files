I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. I agree with and endorse Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft national economic plan for 1958, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 state budget and the draft 1958 state budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on current language reform work and the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

From the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress to the present, our people have victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan. The nationwide rectification movement that began in the second half of last year profoundly educated the people of the whole country and further enhanced the socialist consciousness of the whole nation. This is a great victory for our country's socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This victory has spurred an unprecedented and inspiring new landscape in our country's construction: in industry, we will catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years; in agriculture, we will comprehensively implement the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) during the first to third five-year plans to further rapidly develop productive forces. These great revolutionary programs are inspiring the enthusiasm and drive of the people of the whole country to build socialism. Now the people of the whole country are launching a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

The world situation, due to the success of the Moscow Conference and the launch of two Soviet artificial satellites, has once again ushered in a new turning point in human history; the forces of the new world have surpassed the old world, and the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. This situation is more conducive to the development of our country's socialist cause, which is a major event worthy of celebration by the people of our country.

In the second half of last year, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission mobilized the vast number of dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to participate in the nationwide rectification movement and the struggle against rightists. Through extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, they clarified major issues of right and wrong, and further strengthened their confidence and determination to follow the socialist road.

Abroad, due to the continued and in-depth implementation of our country's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, our international status has continued to improve, and the vast majority of overseas Chinese have become increasingly closely united around the motherland. The Chiang gang's special agents among the overseas Chinese are becoming increasingly isolated. The friendship between the overseas Chinese and the people of their countries of residence has also been greatly enhanced, and the friendly relations between our country and their countries of residence have become closer.

Dependents of Overseas Chinese and Returned Overseas Chinese Should Participate in Production Labor and Contribute to the Construction of the Socialist Motherland
In order to meet the requirements of the new revolutionary situation, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission held its Second First Plenary Session in November last year. According to the spirit of the rectification movement, it examined the bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism in overseas Chinese affairs; criticized the lack of socialist ideological education for dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, the neglect of the fact that dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese should play an active role in building the socialist motherland like the people of the whole country, the neglect of education for returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese to face agricultural labor production and practice thrift and diligence in managing their families; the excessive accommodation and care for dependents of overseas Chinese; and the lack of resolute handling of certain bad elements. It clarified that overseas Chinese affairs departments must resolutely strengthen socialist ideological education for dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, must adhere to the principle of "overall planning and appropriate arrangements" starting from the 600 million people, and handle the special problems of dependents of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students. They should participate in production, participate in labor, and participate in learning like the people of the whole country, and contribute their own strength to the construction of the socialist motherland. Overseas Chinese affairs departments should resolutely implement the central government's instructions on the transfer of cadres to lower levels, in order to train cadres, closely connect with dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, lead dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to participate in production, and strengthen grassroots overseas Chinese affairs work.

Overseas Chinese Should Treat Each Other with Sincerity, Help Each Other, and Frustrate the Chiang Gang's Plot to Harm Overseas Chinese
In order to better implement the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, future overseas Chinese work should first properly resolve the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese, so as to enhance the friendly relations between our country and their countries of residence and facilitate the long-term residence of overseas Chinese in their countries of residence. We advocate that overseas Chinese choose the nationality of their country of residence according to the principle of voluntariness, and be loyal to the country and people they have chosen. For those who retain Chinese nationality, we require them to continue to abide by the policies and laws of their countries of residence, respect the customs and habits of the local people, encourage overseas Chinese commercial economy, transition to local industry, or cooperate with local national capital for operation, and participate in economic construction that is conducive to the national independence of their countries of residence. Overseas Chinese children should learn the local languages, geography, history, and livelihood skills, so as to study and make a living locally. Within the overseas Chinese community, we should continue to implement the spirit of "Patriotism is one family," "Patriotism regardless of order," "Harmony is precious," and "Treat each other with sincerity," extensively carry out mutual assistance, unite all forces that can be united, crack down on and isolate the Chiang gang special agent ringleaders, and frustrate their conspiracies and crimes of harming overseas Chinese.

For overseas Chinese who must return to the country for various reasons, we welcome them to join the people of the whole country in participating in labor production and building the socialist motherland. We will systematically lead them to open up wasteland and cultivate land in Hainan Island and the southern mountainous areas and areas with development potential, and give full play to their expertise in operating tropical crops.

I fully support the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry during the Second Five-Year Plan. In the past few years, our country's agricultural development has achieved great results: the socialist transformation of agriculture was completed ten years ahead of schedule, agricultural cooperativization was basically completed, grain output in 1957 increased by more than 60 billion catties compared with 1952, and great achievements were also made in agricultural capital construction. During the First Five-Year Plan, irrigation increased by 72 million mu, while the actual completion was 210 million mu.

Dependents of Overseas Chinese and Returned Overseas Chinese Invest in the Construction of Overseas Chinese Hometowns and Actively Participate in Water Conservancy and Fertilizer Accumulation
Due to the superiority of cooperativization, the living standards of farmers have been considerably improved. According to statistics from sixteen provinces and cities, among the 345,000 agricultural production cooperatives, 86,616 agricultural cooperatives have caught up with or exceeded the production and income levels of local well-to-do middle peasants. The agricultural development of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the main hometowns of overseas Chinese, has also achieved brilliant results. The total agricultural output value of Guangdong Province increased from 2.69 billion yuan in 1952 to 3.62 billion yuan in 1957. The total grain output in 1957 was 24.5 billion catties, an increase of 5.6 billion catties compared with 1952. Eight counties with a yield of 1,000 catties per mu appeared in the province. Shantou Prefecture, Foshan City, and Lianping County realized the production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule. In 1957, about 20 percent of the agricultural cooperatives and 30 to 40 percent of the farmers in the province caught up with or exceeded the income level of local well-to-do middle peasants. Although Fujian Province suffered relatively serious natural disasters in 1956 and 1957, 1956 was still a bumper year, and the total agricultural output value in 1957 increased by 20 percent compared with 1956. Local industries have also changed the backward phenomenon before liberation and now account for more than 32 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value.

The key to developing agriculture at present is to vigorously carry out mass water conservancy and hog raising and fertilizer accumulation. This is an important measure to ensure increased grain production and strive to change the face of the countryside more quickly. Guangdong and Fujian have already begun large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements. In many areas, dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese have actively participated in this movement. The Overseas Chinese Dependents Work Committee of Matou Town, Nan'an County, Fujian Province, allocated 13,000 yuan to help build water conservancy facilities without interest. Zhang Zhentu, a returned overseas Chinese who had only returned to the country for more than a month, took out 15,000 yuan to invest in his hometown for the construction of flood control dikes, and also actively participated in the preparation work for the project. Dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese should use their surplus remittances, temple fair expenses, wedding and funeral expenses, and savings from superstition for production, in order to strive to basically eliminate water and drought disasters in overseas Chinese areas within one or two years.

Encouraging dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to invest in building small fertilizer plants in their hometowns is completely in line with the current needs of agricultural development. Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company plans to build three small fertilizer plants in overseas Chinese hometowns this year. This approach can not only comprehensively increase production, but also solve the problem of grain and non-staple food supply in overseas Chinese areas. However, it still takes time from plant construction to production. Therefore, it is very necessary to accumulate more farm manure. I have repeatedly proposed encouraging returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese to raise more pigs. The method is "plant feed first and then raise pigs." Raising pigs provides fertilizer to increase production. Pigs are small "chemical fertilizer plants." Raising pigs can directly help agriculture and indirectly help industry. The income from bristles alone is considerable. Raising pigs has many benefits. The vast number of returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese are also actively participating in the fertilizer accumulation movement. More than 30 overseas Chinese women in Shichang She, Jiangzhou Township, Enping County, Guangdong Province, organized a fertilizer accumulation expedition team and went to accumulate fertilizer 20 li away. They accumulated 15,000 catties of fertilizer in four days. In the future, they should also raise more pigs. This year, each household of dependents of overseas Chinese should strive to raise one to two pigs.

Developing Mountainous Area Economy Has Broad Prospects and We Welcome Dependents of Overseas Chinese and Returned Overseas Chinese to Produce in Mountainous Areas
Developing the mountainous area economy is a glorious task for the people of the whole country. About 80 percent of the total area of the mainland is mountainous and semi-mountainous. Fujian is nine mountains and one field, and Guangdong also has a large mountainous area. Mountainous areas are rich in resources. The general goal of mountainous area production and construction in the future is to build the current economically and culturally backward mountainous areas into economically and culturally advanced, prosperous, happy, and socialist mountainous areas. Those returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese who require the government to arrange employment in cities and towns should also respond to the call of the Party and the government and go to the mountainous areas to participate in agricultural labor. Developing the mountainous area economy has broad prospects.

Overseas Chinese children also have many good examples in developing the mountainous area economy. Wu Youlian, a child of an overseas Chinese family in Jinjiang County, responded to the call to work in the mountainous area of Ninghua and achieved outstanding results. He was selected as a national agricultural labor model. Dai Guiying, 17 years old, performed excellently in labor and was selected as a second-class labor model in the Dading Township Third Senior Cooperative in Shishan District, Nan'an County. Wang Ruizhen, a primary school graduate who wants to work in the socialist countryside for the rest of her life, was selected as a people's representative of Shangzhang Township, Fuqing.

Planting Tropical Plants with High Economic Value Is an Important Task for Returned Overseas Chinese
The income from sideline occupations operated by our country's farmers generally accounts for one-third of the income from agricultural and sideline occupations. There are many types of rural sideline occupations. Our country spans the temperate and subtropical zones and has abundant plant resources. It is very suitable for planting economic crops, especially tropical and subtropical plants, in the south. Returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese should, under the leadership of local governments and cooperatives, give priority to the development of grain production, make overall plans, adapt to local conditions, and engage in the production of cotton, hemp, silk, sugar, tea, tobacco, fruits, peanuts, sesame, tung oil, bamboo, pepper, citronella, olives, coffee, cocoa, rubber, coconuts, etc. Guangdong and Yunnan provinces have particularly good conditions and can grow a large number of tropical crops. The Guangdong Subtropical Resources Development Committee has initially formulated an eleven-year plan, deciding that more than 13 million mu of wasteland that has been surveyed and planned will be planted with rubber, sisal, sea island cotton, mangroves, coconuts, oil palm, and coffee by state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives. In the first half of last year, Hainan Island planted more than 110,000 mu, and the planting area of oil palm and sisal increased by about five times compared with last year. Although Yunnan is located on the frontier, it is also a treasure land for growing tropical crops. More than 40 kinds of tropical crops with particularly high economic value can be grown, such as shellac, rubber, and camphor. Yunnan has established 13 tropical crop farms and is planting a large number of rubber and coffee.

Developing Hainan and southern Yunnan is an important task for returned overseas Chinese. Many returned overseas Chinese have experience in operating tropical and subtropical economic crops. Many scientists among the returned overseas Chinese also hope to study the production of economic crops, cultivation techniques, and the development of various commodity production in the motherland, increase yields, and increase national wealth.

In areas where conditions permit, returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese can also engage in the production of valuable medicinal materials such as antlers, musk, cassia bark, amomum villosum, cardamom, cinchona, and rhubarb, and Hepu pearls, etc., and raise more cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits, chickens, ducks, and geese, etc., and also engage in the production of dairy products from cattle and sheep. In coastal areas, they can fish and weave nets, salt and dry seafood, and combine with local conditions to make bamboo curtains, bamboo chairs, bamboo beds, bamboo hats, and weave rattan chairs and other handicraft and sideline production. They can use silk and wool blended weaving and silk and cotton blended weaving to supply raw materials for the textile industry. They can also use bamboo, reeds, and sugarcane to supply raw materials for the paper industry. In addition, all production avenues with development potential should be vigorously developed. This can not only increase social wealth, increase the materials for foreign trade, increase the income of rural people, and enable rural people to have food, clothing, and use; but also support industry and promote national industrialization.

Our nation has awakened and is carrying forward a vigorous revolutionary spirit. It is like a rising sun, full of vitality. Our country is now a scene of prosperous construction everywhere. Many things that many people thought could not be done in the past have been done by the masses in a short period of time. We are doing things that no one has done before. I hope that overseas Chinese will be more united and patriotic, enhance friendship with the people of their countries of residence, and contribute to promoting friendship between China and their countries of residence and to Asian and world peace.

Overseas Chinese affairs departments in various localities should make overall plans, strengthen political and ideological education for returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese, so that they and the people of the whole country can summon revolutionary enthusiasm, strive for progress, build the socialist motherland more, faster, better, and more economically, increase production and practice thrift, be diligent and thrifty in managing their families, and work hard under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government to complete and overfulfill the 1958 production and construction tasks.

　　侨眷归侨同样要鼓起干劲力争上游
    华侨事务委员会何香凝主任的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，我同意和拥护薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，和吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告。
    （一）
    从全国人民代表大会第一届第四次会议到现在，我国人民胜利地完成了第一个五年计划。去年下半年开始的全民性的整风运动，空前深刻地教育了全国人民，更加提高了全民的社会主义觉悟。这是我国在政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利。这一胜利促使我国建设上出现了一种空前的令人振奋的新景象：在工业方面，要在十五年左右在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国；在农业方面，要在第一个到第三个五年计划期间全面贯彻实施全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），进一步迅速发展生产力。这些伟大的革命纲领，鼓舞着全国人民建设社会主义的热情和干劲。现在全国人民正掀起工农业生产的大跃进。
    世界局势由于莫斯科会议的成功和苏联两颗人造卫星上天，人类历史又一次出现一个新的转折点；新世界的力量已经超过旧世界，东风压倒了西风，这一形势更加有利于我国社会主义事业的发展，这是我国人民值得欣幸庆祝的大事。
    （二）
    去年下半年，侨务部门发动广大侨眷、归侨参加了全民性的整风运动和反右派斗争，通过大鸣大放，大字报，大辩论，明辨了大是大非，更坚定了走社会主义道路的信心和决心。
    在国外，由于我国和平共处五项原则的继续深入贯彻，国际地位不断提高，绝大多数的华侨日益紧密地团结在祖国周围。华侨中的蒋帮特务分子日益孤立。华侨和侨居国人民友谊也有了更大的增进，更密切了我国和侨居国的友好关系。
    侨眷、归侨要同样参加生产劳动  为建设社会主义祖国贡献出力量
    为着适应新的革命形势的要求，中侨委在去年十一月举行了第二届第一次委员会议，根据整风运动精神检查了侨务工作中的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义；批判了对侨眷、归侨进行社会主义思想教育不够，忽视侨眷、归侨应和全国人民一样在建设社会主义祖国中发挥积极的因素，忽视对归侨、侨眷面向农业劳动生产和勤俭持家的教育；对侨眷、归侨迁就照顾多；对某些坏分子坚决处理不够等缺点和错误。明确了侨务部门今后必须坚决加强对侨眷、归侨的社会主义思想教育，必须坚持从六亿人民出发“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的原则，处理侨眷、归侨、归国华侨学生的特殊问题。他们要和全国人民一样地参加生产，参加劳动，参加学习，为建设社会主义祖国贡献出自己的力量。侨务部门应当坚决执行中央关于干部下放的指示，以便锻炼干部，密切联系侨眷、归侨，领导侨眷、归侨参加生产，加强基层侨务工作。
    国外华侨要相见以诚互助互济  粉碎蒋帮特务祸侨害侨的阴谋
    为了更好地贯彻和平共处五项原则的精神，今后国外华侨工作，首先应妥善地解决华侨双重国籍问题，以增进我国和侨居国的友好关系，便利华侨在当地长远居留。我们主张让华侨根据自愿的原则，选择侨居国国籍，并效忠于所选择的国家和人民。对于保留中国国籍的人，我们要求他们继续遵守侨居国的政策、法令，尊重当地人民的风俗习惯，鼓励华侨的商业经济，转营当地工业，或与当地民族资本合作经营，参加有利于侨居国民族独立的经济建设。华侨子女应当学习当地的语言文字、地理历史和谋生技术，以便在当地升学、谋生。华侨内部，仍应贯彻“爱国一家”、“爱国不分先后”、“和为贵”、“相见以诚”的精神，广泛开展互助互济，团结一切可能团结的力量，打击、孤立蒋帮特务罪魁，粉碎他们祸侨害侨的阴谋罪行。
    对于因各种原因必需回国的华侨，我们欢迎他们和全国人民一道，参加劳动生产，建设社会主义祖国。我们将有计划地领导他们在海南岛及南方山区和有发展条件的地区，开荒垦殖，发挥他们经营热带作物的专长。
    （三）
    我完全拥护在第二个五年计划期间，在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针。几年来，我国农业发展已经取得了巨大的成绩：提前十年完成了农业的社会主义改造，基本上完成农业合作化，粮食产量一九五七年比一九五二年增长了六百多亿斤，农业基本建设方面也取得巨大成就，第一个五年计划水利增加灌溉面积是七千二百万亩，而实际完成二亿一千万亩。
    侨眷归侨投资建设侨乡  积极参加修水利积肥料
    由于合作化的优越性，农民的生活水平有了相当的改善，据十六个省市的统计，在三十四万五千多个农业生产合作社中有八万六千六百一十六个农业社已赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产和收入水平。主要侨乡广东、福建两省的农业发展也取得了辉煌的成绩。广东省农业总产值从一九五二年的二十六亿九千万元增加到一九五七年的三十六亿二千万元，粮食总产量一九五七年是二百四十五亿斤，比一九五二年增五十六亿斤，全省出现了八个千斤县，汕头专区和佛山市、连平县提前十年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的生产指标。一九五七年全省约有百分之二十的农业社和百分之三十至四十的农户赶上或者超过了当地富裕中农的收入水平。福建省虽然一九五六年和一九五七年受到较严重的自然灾害，但一九五六年还是大丰收，一九五七年农业总产值比一九五六年增加百分之二十。地方工业在解放后也改变了解放前的落后现象，已占工农业总产值的百分之三十二强。
    当前发展农业的关键，是大力开展群众性的兴修水利与养猪积肥。这是保证粮食增产，争取更快改变农村面貌的重要措施。广东、福建都已开始了大规模兴修水利和积肥运动。很多地区的侨眷、归侨积极地投入了这一运动。福建南安县山区码头镇的侨属工作委员会，拨出一万三千元，无利息投资帮助兴修水利，回国才一个多月的归侨张振凸，拿出一万五千元投入乡里做修建防洪堤的费用，同时还积极参加工程的筹备工作。侨眷、归侨应该把侨汇余资、酬神赛会、婚丧大事和迷信的节省费用，用在生产上，以便在一、二年内争取基本消灭侨区的水旱灾害。
    鼓励侨眷、归侨在家乡投资兴办小型肥料厂，是完全适合目前农业发展需要的。福建华侨投资公司准备在今年内在侨乡兴办三个小型肥料厂，这种做法既能全面增加生产，而且也是解决侨区粮食和副食品供应问题的一个好办法。但是从建厂到生产毕竟还需要一段时间，因此，广积农家肥是十分必要的。我过去曾多次提出鼓励归侨、侨眷多养猪，办法是“先种饲料后养猪”。养猪有肥料可以增加生产，猪就是小的“化学肥料厂”，养猪既可以直接帮助农业，又可以间接帮助工业，仅猪鬃一项，收入也不少，养猪是有很多好处的。广大归侨、侨眷对积肥运动也是积极参加的，广东恩平县江州乡石塘社三十多个侨眷妇女就组织了积肥远征队，到二十华里外去积肥，四天积肥一万五千斤，今后还应该多养猪，争取今年侨眷每户应争取养猪一头到两头。
    开发山区经济有广阔前途  欢迎侨眷归侨到山区生产
    开展山区经济，是全国人民一项光荣的任务。在大陆国土上总面积中有百分之八十左右是山区和半山区，福建是九山一田，广东山区面积也很大。山区资源丰富。今后山区生产建设的总目标是要把现在经济上文化上落后的山区建设成经济上文化上进步、繁荣、康乐、幸福的社会主义的山区。要求政府在城镇安排职业的归侨、侨眷，也应响应党和政府号召，到山区去参加农业劳动。开发山区经济是有广阔前途的。
    华侨子女在发展山区经济上也有不少好榜样，晋江县侨属子女吴友联，响应号召到宁化山区劳动，有突出的成绩，被选为全国农业劳动模范；十七岁的戴桂英劳动出色，被选为南安县诗山区大庭乡第三高级社的二等劳动模范。要在社会主义农村干一辈子的小学毕业生王瑞珍，被选为福清上张乡人民代表。
    种植经济价值特大的热带植物是归国华侨的一项重要任务
    我国农民经营的副业收入，一般占农副业收入三分之一。农村副业种类很多，我国地跨温带和亚热带，植物资源丰富，在南方经济作物特别是热带和亚热带植物的种植非常合适。归侨、侨眷应该在优先发展粮食生产的条件下，在各地政府和合作社的领导下，统筹兼顾、因地制宜，从事棉、麻、丝、糖、茶、烟、水果、花生、芝麻、桐油、竹子、胡椒、香茅、橄榄、咖啡、可可、树胶、椰子等生产。广东和云南两省条件特别好，可大量种植热带作物。广东亚热带资源开发委员会初步制订十一年规划，决定一千三百多万亩经过勘察和规划的荒地，由国营农场和农业社来种植橡胶、剑麻、海岛棉、红树、椰子、油棕和咖啡等，去年上半年海南岛已种植了十一万多亩，油棕和剑麻的种植面积比去年增加五倍左右。云南虽地处边疆，但也是种植热带作物的宝地，可以种四十多种经济价值特别大的热带作物，如紫胶、橡胶、樟脑等。云南已建立了十三个热带作物农场，大量种植橡胶和咖啡。
    开发海南和云南南部是归侨的重要任务。许多归侨有经营热带和亚热带经济作物的经验，归侨中也有不少科学家希望研究祖国经济作物生产情况，栽培技术，发展各种商品的生产，增加产量，以增加国家财富。
    在有条件的地方，归侨、侨眷还可经营鹿茸、麝香、玉桂、砂仁、豆?、金鸡纳霜、大黄等贵重药材和合浦珍珠等生产，多喂养牛、羊、猪、兔和鸡、鸭、鹅等家畜、家禽，此外，还可兼养牛、羊乳制品生产。在近海地方，可以打鱼织网，腌晒海产，并结合当地情况，做竹帘、竹椅、竹床、竹帽、织藤椅等手工业、副业生产。利用丝毛合织、丝棉合织，供应纺织工业原料。利用竹子、芦苇、甘蔗等，又可供给造纸工业原料。此外，一切有发展可能的生产门路，都要大力发展。这样不仅可以增加社会财富，增加对外贸易的物资，增加农村人民的收入，使农村人民自己有吃的，有穿的，有用的；而且可以支援工业，促进国家工业化。
    我们的民族已经觉醒起来，正在发扬旺盛的革命精神，他如初生的太阳，朝气勃勃。我们的国家现在到处是兴旺繁荣的建设景象，过去许多人认为办不到的事，群众却在不长的时间内办到了。我们正在做着前无古人的事业。我希望国外华侨更加团结爱国，增进和侨居国人民的友谊，为促进中国与侨居国友好，为亚洲和世界和平贡献力量。
    各地侨务部门都应做全面规划，加强对归侨、侨眷的政治思想教育，使他们和全国人民一道鼓起革命干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义祖国，增产节约，克勤克俭，勤俭持家，在中国共产党、人民政府领导下，为完成和超额完成一九五八年生产建设任务而努力。
