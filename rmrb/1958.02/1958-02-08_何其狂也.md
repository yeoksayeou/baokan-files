Title: How Arrogant!

    Last November, the British philosopher Bertrand Russell published an open letter in the British weekly "New Statesman" addressed to both Khrushchev and Eisenhower, advocating that the Soviet and American leaders meet face-to-face to discuss the issue of peaceful coexistence. Khrushchev had already expressed his welcome to Russell's proposal in a reply, but Eisenhower was slow to respond.

    Recently, Eisenhower actually had Dulles answer on his behalf. "Ivory doesn't grow from a dog's mouth," and Dulles could not say anything good. In his letter, he repeated his die-hard anti-Soviet stance for the thousandth time, even criticizing Russell's reasonable view that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union needed to "abandon their belief in their own faith." Dulles said pretentiously: "It is of course good for the United States... it is not so for Soviet Communism... The Soviet Communist Party needs to abandon at least a part of their faith." What arrogance!

    The United States indeed does not need to abandon its faith, but the arrogant attitude and forever unrealizable dream of people like Dulles, who want to change the beliefs of others, must be abandoned.

    何其狂也
    去年11月英国哲学家罗素在英国“新政治家”周刊上发表了致赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔两人的公开信，主张苏美领导人当面会晤讨论和平共处问题。赫鲁晓夫早已在复信中对罗素的主张表示欢迎，但是艾森豪威尔却迟迟未予答复。
    最近艾森豪威尔竟让杜勒斯出面作答。“狗嘴里长不出象牙”，杜勒斯是说不出什么好话来的。他在信里第一千次重复他反苏的死硬主张，甚至批评罗素这样一个合理的观点：美国和苏联都没有必要“放弃对自己的信仰的信念”。杜勒斯神气活现地说：“对美国来说当然不错，……对苏联共产主义来说便不是这样，……苏联共产党有必要至少放弃他们一部分信仰”。好大的口气！
    美国的确没有必要放弃它的信仰，但是杜勒斯之流的这种要想改变别人信仰的狂妄态度和永远实现不了的梦想却非放弃不可。
