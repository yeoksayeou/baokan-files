    Idle Talk about Worshipping the Kitchen God

    "Offer sugar candy to the Kitchen God, the Great Year is coming." According to old customs, today is the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month, which is the day for worshipping the Kitchen God.
    The original worship of the Kitchen God was to worship the "first cook," because he taught people to cook food, which was a contribution to humanity. At that time, the sacrificial rites were very simple, only using cooking utensils such as basins and bottles to hold wine and food for sacrifice. It was only later that it gradually evolved into worshipping the Kitchen God.
    The Kitchen God was originally a vague, illusory, superstitious idol, but in the feudal ruling era, superstition helped the rulers maintain their feudal order, and the oppressed could also use it to express their feelings and as a spiritual sustenance. Therefore, legends about the Kitchen God and customs of worshipping the Kitchen God spread widely.
    It is said that the Kitchen God was originally a star in the sky, but because he committed a crime, the Jade Emperor demoted him to the human world, let him stay in other people's homes, observe who had done wrong, and then go to heaven to report to the Jade Emperor. And the Kitchen God, like a human being, has his own name, wife, children. His name is "Siming," and he specializes in observing minor faults in the human world and condemning errors. Huainan Wanbishu and Baopuzi also say that the Kitchen God reports people's sins to heaven, which reduces their lifespan, so the Kitchen God is also called "Siming."
    In the Eastern Han Dynasty, people worshiped "Siming" exclusively. They made a wooden statue one foot and two inches long, and travelers placed it in boxes and cabinets, while residents made another small house to enshrine it. The later Kitchen God image and Kitchen God shrine are derived from this. Cao Zhi's poem says: "The day is bitterly short, and there is plenty of joy, so set up a jade pot and prepare the eastern kitchen." In ancient times, the door of the kitchen was mostly in the east, hence the name Eastern Kitchen. The words "Eastern Kitchen Siming" are often seen on the Kitchen God statue, which is the meaning of this.
    The Han people said that the Kitchen God returned to heaven on the last day of the month (the end of the month), but it was not certain which month. However, Yin Zifang's sacrifice to the Kitchen God was on the La Day, so it can be seen that there was already a sacrifice to the Kitchen God in the twelfth lunar month in the Han Dynasty.
    Later, the Kitchen God was mostly sent off on the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month (or the twenty-fourth day), and the Kitchen God was mostly welcomed back on New Year's Eve. This may be because the twenty-third to New Year's Eve is exactly equivalent to an ancient "return" (date), and the twenty-fourth day is because the twelfth lunar month has large and small constructions, and the twenty-fourth day is also the day for the New Year festival.
    The ceremony of worshipping the Kitchen God begins after dinner when it is just getting dark. A table is set up, the Kitchen God statue is placed on it, and incense, candles, paper horses, clear tea, bowls, chopsticks, malt sugar, etc. are placed at the front of the table. In addition, a plate of horse grass and fodder and a bowl of cold water are placed, which is said to feed the Kitchen God's horse (since the Tang Dynasty, the Kitchen God has been mostly called the Kitchen King). Among these sacrifices, the main one is "sugar." Because the Kitchen God has eaten something sweet, he will say "good words" about people instead of "bad words" when he goes to heaven. In the old society, where "bribery and acceptance of bribes" prevailed, even the Kitchen God had to be bribed. Doesn't the couplet on the shrine frame also say "Speak good things in heaven, and protect peace in the world?!" The two words "good things" imply how much bitterness and pain the oppressed people felt! And among the ruling class who cheated and deceived each other, these two words "good things" meant how many ugly deeds they had done! The final part of the sacrificial ceremony is to take the Kitchen God statue out of the shrine, place it on top of yellow paper money and other items, and light it on fire. At the same time, the horse grass and fodder from the sacrifices are also burned. The Kitchen God ascends to heaven with the green smoke, and the program of worshipping the Kitchen God is considered to be over. As for those poor families, who usually have no smoke and a cold stove, they will not have enough money to buy sugar to worship the Kitchen God on this day, so they have to recite "The Kitchen God's surname is Zhang, a bowl of cold water and three incense sticks, the boy has had a hard time this year, and I will ask you to eat sugar next year." In this way, they bleakly spend the twenty-third day.
    Since liberation, although there are still people selling malt sugar on the streets every year on the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month, this is definitely not for the Kitchen God to eat, but to add some joy to the lives of our broad masses during their work breaks. Thinking of the bumper harvest of agriculture and the leap forward of industry, we live in this happy era, sweetness in our mouths! Sweetness in our hearts!

    闲话祭灶
    左宦
    “糖瓜祭灶，大年来到。”照旧习，今天是阴历腊月二十三，正是祭灶的日子。
    最初的祭灶是祭“先炊”者，因为他教人熟食，有功于人。当时祭礼很简单，只是用盆瓶之类的炊具把酒食盛在里面一祭而已。其后才逐渐演变成祭灶了。
    灶神本是个虚无缥渺、迷信偶像的名字，不过在封建统治时代。迷信既有助于统治者维持他的封建秩序，而被压迫者也可借此抒泄心情和作为精神寄托，因此，关于灶王的传说和祭灶的风俗，流传极广。
    据说灶王爷本是天上的一颗星宿，因为犯了罪，玉皇大帝便把他贬谪到人间，让他呆在别人家里，察看谁作了错事，然后便上天去向玉皇大帝汇报。而灶神也像人一样，有他自己的名字和妻室儿女。名叫“司命”，他是专察人间小过，谴责错误的。淮南万毕术同抱朴子上也说灶神上天告人罪状，有减寿之说，于是灶神也被称为“司命”了。
    在东汉时是专祭“司命”的。用木头作一尺二寸长人像，行路人放在箱箧中，居家人另作小屋供奉。后来的灶王像，灶王龛即袭此而来。曹植诗：“日苦短，乐有余，乃置玉樽办东厨”。古来庖厨之门，大多在东，因是有东厨之名。在灶神像上常常看到“东厨司命”四字即是此意了。
    汉人说灶神晦日（月底）归天，究竟哪个月，没有肯定。不过阴子方祭灶是在腊日，可知汉时已有腊月祭灶了。
    后来送灶多在腊月二十三日（或二十四日），接灶多在除夕。可能因为二十三到除夕正相当于古人的一个“来复”（日期），二十四日是因为腊月有大小建，而且二十四日又是交年节。
    祭灶的仪式，是在晚饭后天刚黑的时候开始。放好桌子，把灶神像摆出来，在桌子最前面放好香烛，纸马，清茶，碗筷和麦芽糖等。另外再摆一盘马草马料，一碗凉水，据说这是喂灶王马的（自唐以后多称灶神为灶王）。在这些祭品中主要是“糖”。因为灶神吃过嘴甜了，到天上去，就说人的“好话”而不说“坏话”了。在“行贿受赂”盛行的旧社会里，连灶王爷也要受贿赂。龛框的对子不是也写着“上天言好事，下界保平安”么？！“好事”这两个字意味着被压迫的人民多少辛酸！多少痛苦！而在尔诈我虞的统治阶级者中这“好事”二字又意味着他们干了多少丑恶的勾当啊！祭仪的最后一段，是将灶神像从龛中拿出，放在黄钱等物之上，点火焚化，同时把祭品中的马草马料一并焚烧。灶神便随着青烟上天而去，祭灶的节目至此便算演完了。至于那些贫穷人家，平日就是烟绝灶冷，到了这天更不会有富裕钱去买糖祭灶了，只好念着“灶王爷本姓张，一碗凉水三炷香，今年小子过的苦，明年再请您吃糖”。就这样黯然地度过了二十三日。
    解放后，虽然每到腊月二十三日，街头仍有卖麦芽糖的，但这绝不是给灶神吃了，而是让我们广大的群众，在工余之暇，添一些生活的愉快。想到农业的丰收，工业的跃进，我们生活在这幸福时代，甜在嘴里！甜在心头！
