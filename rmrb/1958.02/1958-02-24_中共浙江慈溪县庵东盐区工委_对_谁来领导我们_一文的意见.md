    The CCP Zhejiang Cixi County Andong Salt District Working Committee
    Opinion on "Who Will Lead Us?"
    Editor's Note: On January 3rd, this newspaper published a letter from Zhedong, a staff member of the CCP Andong Salt District Working Committee, titled "Who Will Lead Us?" on page three. Due to our lack of a serious and responsible attitude in handling this letter, and our failure to conduct necessary understanding and verification of the author and the facts, there were significant discrepancies in the facts. In addition to expressing our apologies to the CCP Andong Salt District Working Committee and taking this incident as a lesson, we are now publishing the CCP Andong Salt District Working Committee's opinion on this matter below:
    After the publication of Zhedong's article "Who Will Lead Us?" in the reader's column of the People's Daily on January 3rd, our Working Committee held a meeting on January 8th, convened by Secretary Sun. In addition to reviewing the organizational discipline of our agency over the past two years and the implementation of the resolution on strengthening Party unity, we criticized Zhedong's critical manuscript.
    We believe that Zhedong's criticism is fundamentally fabricated, exaggerates shortcomings, denies the positive leadership of the Provincial and Prefectural Committees over the Andong Salt District, and is an act of sowing discord and undermining unity. The article asks: "Who will lead us?" Our definite answer is: "The Provincial Committee, the Prefectural Committee, the County Committee, and the People's Committees at all levels, as well as the higher-level departments, are actively leading us."
    First, in terms of documents and publications: In January and March of 1957, during the handover period when the Salt District was placed under the leadership of Cixi, there was a very short period when we did not receive publications from the Provincial and Prefectural Committees. However, the County Committee's documents were sent to us without interruption. In addition, the Zhejiang Daily, Ningbo Dazhong, and Cixi Bao, which popularized the Andong Salt District cooperatives, were also guiding our work. Take the class policy education and cooperative rectification campaign conducted among the masses in February and March of 1957. This was mainly due to the guidance of Minister Xin of the Prefectural Committee, the direct leadership of the County Committee, and the Zhejiang Daily's publication of the results and methods of implementing and carrying out class policy and rectifying cooperatives in counties such as Xiaoshan, which enabled the Salt District to implement class policy and rectify cooperatives.
    Second, Zhedong's criticism that the Provincial and Prefectural Committees did not allow Andong cadres to attend meetings is even more absurd. The Provincial Committee's Rural Work Department holds a conference for salt district cadres every year, and also regularly holds work inspections and experience exchange meetings for salt district cadres. The Prefectural Committee's Cooperative Department also continuously holds meetings for salt district cadres. The Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau calls us to attend even more meetings, and there are also many meetings in the county. These meetings are attended not only by secretaries, district heads, and full-time cadres, but also by many cooperative cadres.
    Third, the enthusiastic concern for the leadership of the Andong Salt District is further demonstrated by the personal leadership of leading comrades from higher levels and cadres from higher-level organs. The Director and section chiefs of the Central Salt Affairs Bureau came, as well as the section chief of the Provincial Committee's Rural Work Department and the director of the Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau, who frequently came to provide guidance. Minister Xin of the Prefectural Committee treated Andong as his office, residing in Andong for even longer periods. The director of the Fishery and Salt Bureau, the section chief of the Cooperative Department, and other cadres from the Provincial and Prefectural Committees lived in Andong year-round without interruption. The Provincial Work Team is still in Andong, and Deputy Secretary Sun Zongkai of the County Committee and Committee Member Gao Jiugao of the County Committee both concurrently serve as secretaries of the Working Committee. The great achievements made by the Salt District over the past few years are inseparable from the personal guidance of these leading comrades.
    Fourth, Zhedong said that because the higher-level Provincial and Prefectural Committees did not send instructions to Andong and did not allow Andong cadres to attend meetings, and did not convey the content of meetings afterward, the Salt District did not promptly launch the increase production and practice economy movement, which seriously affected the completion of the 1957 production tasks. This is even more slanderous. The facts show that, thanks to the correct leadership and active support of the Provincial, Prefectural, and County Committees, the Salt District's increase production and practice economy movement was promptly implemented during the typhoon disaster in 1956, and a movement for self-salvation through increased production and thrift was launched. This helped us overcome the disaster and promote an all-round bumper harvest in salt and agriculture in 1957.
    Fifth, Zhedong is a clerk in the receiving and dispatch office of our Committee. He is usually passive in his work, using illness as an excuse. He has been very dishonest in the rectification movement. This time, he stole the name of the Working Committee in the People's Daily, deceived the trust of the People's Daily, and published this slanderous critical manuscript. We believe his mistake is serious and have given him criticism and education to help him correct his mistakes.

### 中共浙江慈溪县庵东盐区工委  对“谁来领导我们”一文的意见

1958-02-24
第3版()
专栏：

    中共浙江慈溪县庵东盐区工委
    对“谁来领导我们”一文的意见
    编者按：1月3日，本报三版发表了中共庵东盐区工委工作人员浙东的来信“谁来领导我们”，由于我们在处理这一来信时缺乏严肃负责的态度，对作者和事实没有作必要的了解和核对，因而事实有很大出入。我们除了对中共庵东盐区工委表示歉意，并以此事引为教训外，现将中共庵东盐区工委对此事的意见发表在下面：
    1月3日人民日报读者来信栏内，发表我们机关浙东所写“谁来领导我们”一文后，我们在1月8日由孙书记召开了工委会议，除检查了两年来我们机关的组织性纪律性和执行关于加强党内团结决议等问题外，对浙东的批评稿作了批判。
    我们认为浙东的批评，根本是捏造事实，扩大缺点，否认省委和地委对庵东盐区的积极领导，是挑拨离间、破坏团结的行为。文中问：“谁来领导我们”？我们肯定的答复：“省委、地委、县委和各级人委与上级部门都积极在领导我们”。
    一、从文件报刊方面来说：1957年1、3月间，当盐区划归慈溪领导的交接期间，有很短一段时间没发到过省地委的刊物。但县委的文件就没有间断地发给我们，还有普及庵东盐区合作社的浙江日报、宁波大众、慈溪报也在领导着我们的工作。就拿1957年2、3月间向广大群众进行阶级政策教育，整顿合作社的事情来说，主要是由于地委信部长的指导，县委的直接领导和浙江日报登载了萧山等县执行贯彻阶级政策整顿合作社的效果和方法，使盐区能够贯彻阶级政策整顿合作社。
    二、浙东批评省委、地委不让庵东干部参加会议，更是无稽之谈。省委农村工作部每年都要召开一次盐区干部会议，平时还经常召开盐区干部的工作检查和交流经验等会议，地委合作部也不断召开盐区干部会议，省盐务局叫我们参加的会议更多，县里会议也不少。这些会议，不仅书记、区长和脱产干部参加，连合作社的干部也有很多人参加。
    三、从上级领导同志和上级机关干部亲自领导庵东的情况来看，更说明对庵东盐区领导的热情关切。中央盐务总局有局长、科长来，省委农工部的处长，省盐务局的局长经常来指导。地委信部长更是把庵东当作他的办公室，驻庵东的时间更多。渔盐局局长、合作部科长和其他省地委干部，一年到头无间歇地住在庵东，省工作队现在还是在庵东，县委副书记孙宗凯同志，县委委员皋九皋同志都兼工委书记。盐区几年来取得的巨大成绩，是和这些领导同志的亲自指导分不开的。
    四、浙东说，由于上级省地委不给庵东发指示，不让庵东干部参加会议，而会后又不传达，致使盐区没有及时开展增产节约运动，严重的影响1957年生产任务的完成。这更是一种诽谤。事实说明：盐区的增产节约运动，由于省、地、县委的正确领导和积极支持，自1956年台灾过境时，便及时地贯彻了增产节约生产自救运动。渡过了灾荒，促使1957年盐农业全面丰收。
    五、浙东是本委机关秘书室的收发员，平时借口有病，工作消极。在整风中表现很不老实。这次在人民日报又盗窃了工委名义，骗取人民日报的信任，发表了这种诬蔑性的批评稿。我们认为他的错误是严重的，已给以批评和教育，以帮助他改正错误。
