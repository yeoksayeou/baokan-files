　　Hearts Bloom with Joy, Advance Courageously!
　　Ji Wei
    The same thing often has two completely different views and approaches. Faced with difficulties, some people complain and fear hardship, hesitating to move forward; others believe that difficulties make work more energetic and flavorful. Having achieved success, some people are satisfied with the status quo, while others take advantage of the victory to forge ahead and strive for even greater achievements. Some people are listless, often pessimistic and negative, while others are full of vigor, brimming with revolutionary optimism.
    We need to greatly promote revolutionary optimism, so that the people's hearts bloom with joy, full of confidence, courage, and high morale, working with increasing vigor!
    Some comrades often like to shout about difficulties, emphasize shortcomings, and exaggerate unfavorable conditions, so they are always heavy-hearted, full of worries, and find every step difficult, often ranking last in many tasks. We should remind these comrades, encourage them, boost their confidence, increase their courage, and help them find ways to overcome difficulties, so that their hearts also bloom with joy.
    Comrades working in any place should settle down in that place, take root, blossom, and bear fruit, and persevere in their work. They should love this place more and more, and cultivate their own revolutionary "love of their hometown"; not only loving the people of this place, but also loving every mountain, every river, every flower, and every tree. Leading comrades of a province, a county, a township, or a commune should enthusiastically familiarize themselves with and utilize all the superior conditions of this area, and joyfully discover and cultivate all the good people and good deeds of this area, creating various model units and model individuals. Leading comrades should give these good people and good deeds infinitely enthusiastic care, and constantly pay attention to their development; they should be able to vividly and specifically describe their advantages like enumerating family treasures, and use various appropriate opportunities to conduct propaganda and mobilization to their subordinate cadres, so that all cadres are familiar with the good people, good deeds, good villages, good communes, good factories, good mines, good mountains, and good waters of this area, making the cadres here feel more and more that this area is lovely, and more and more that being able to work here is a great happiness, so that they naturally develop a sense of pride as cadres of this area.
    Looking at models, looking at advantages, looking at favorable conditions, and being good at discovering and cultivating all excellent things is an important way to promote revolutionary optimism. For the backward things, bad phenomena, difficult conditions, unfavorable factors, and shortcomings and mistakes in various tasks in this place, should we turn a blind eye and a deaf ear in order to cultivate revolutionary optimism? Of course not, we should also pay attention to them at the same time. However, we should not forget that our attention to these negative factors is to eliminate them, and the purpose of developing all positive factors is precisely to clear away these negative and backward factors. Therefore, we cannot look at the negative factors in isolation, and cannot make the cadres feel that this is also a problem, that is also a mistake, this is a difficulty, and that is backward, making everyone's eyes full of darkness and their hearts full of sorrow. We must criticize shortcomings and mistakes on the premise of affirming achievements, analyze unfavorable conditions in the context of fully understanding favorable conditions, and find experiences and methods to overcome backward phenomena in advanced things. There are some leading comrades who, of course, may be more intelligent than their subordinates in some aspects. When they come to a place, they can indeed discover shortcomings that others have not noticed, and they can indeed find problems that others have not recognized. Therefore, they criticize this and blame that, this is wrong and that is not good. In fact, this leadership method is not clever, because it often dampens the enthusiasm of cadres and reduces their confidence in their work. What should an excellent leader's cleverness primarily manifest itself in when they come to any place? It should manifest itself in: they are good at discovering good people and good deeds that others have not discovered, and good at finding favorable conditions that others have not recognized. They can help subordinate cadres to better summarize and improve the good ideas, good work styles, and good experiences of these good people and good deeds, and establish various models for overcoming difficulties and correcting mistakes. They can also help cadres to better discover and utilize various favorable conditions, increase cadres' confidence in overcoming difficulties, and teach cadres to be good at changing unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. Therefore, they can not only keenly discover the problems here, but also study experiences and lessons that others have not thought of in response to the problems here; therefore, they can not only see the weaknesses of cadres, but also see the advantages of cadres, and can help cadres to overcome their weaknesses. Such a leader is a promoter, and an inspirer of revolutionary optimism.
    Some people believe that working in economically and culturally developed areas is of course very happy because the conditions are very good, but in areas where economic and cultural development is indeed relatively backward and the conditions are indeed more difficult, how can people be made to bloom with joy? To make these comrades also bloom with joy, the best way is to first find advanced examples and see the benefits. Because any place with relatively backward development is not all backward, there must be many advanced units and advanced individuals, and even particularly outstanding good examples. Seeing these advanced things is seeing hope, and the heart will be nourished, and will first change the extremely incorrect general impression of this area as "nothing is good, everything is backward". To determine whether the level and speed of economic and cultural development of an area are advanced or backward, it should mainly be compared with its past, to see on what basis it has developed, and to see under what specific conditions it has developed. It is not very fair to compare it with other regions only from absolute figures. Judging from absolute figures, the level of area A may not be as good as that of area B, but from the perspective of relative comparison, the development speed of area A may not necessarily be lower than that of area B. More importantly, we cannot look at the economic and cultural situation of an area from a static state, but from the perspective of development, and from the perspective of its development prospects. Looking at the current situation, it is not as good as others, but looking at its potential power, looking at its resources, looking at its treasures, especially looking at the mass conditions there, the future is often bright and the hope is endless. For example, remote mountainous areas may not be as good as plains areas near cities in terms of the current situation, but there are not only timber forests, economic forests, fruits, medicinal materials, rare flowers and herbs, and precious birds and animals, but also very rich mineral deposits underground; especially the masses there, because they have been in relatively difficult conditions for a long time, they have rich experience in fighting against nature, and have a strong desire and tenacious drive to get rid of poverty and build a prosperous mountainous area. The more fully we estimate these endless potential forces, the more we give people infinite hope and confidence, and the more we arouse people's love for these currently relatively backward areas. The more comrades working in these areas view the problem in this way, the more they will increase their love for this area, and the more they will increase their revolutionary optimism.
    What about difficulties? Of course, we must also face up to difficulties, and conduct specific analysis of specific difficulties. When specifically analyzing difficulties, we must look at them from the perspective of development, and from the perspective of overcoming them. When we have not started to overcome a difficulty, it seems to be very big. If we stop in front of this difficulty, the difficulty will always exist. If we do not let it lie on our path forward, and fight it with the spirit of marching to the battlefield with a triumphant song, the situation will change significantly in the struggle. Not only will this difficulty be gradually overcome, but mainly our subjective combat effectiveness will be continuously improved in the struggle. The better the combat conditions, the more combat experience we have, especially when small victories accumulate into big victories, and one victory after another, the masses' confidence and enthusiasm in the struggle will become higher and higher. The difficulties that originally seemed very big will no longer be a problem, and the tasks that were originally considered difficult to complete will be insignificant. The great miracles created in the water conservancy construction movement in many regions this time fully illustrate this problem. Anhui Province has historically been a province plagued by droughts and floods, especially the Huaibei area, which has suffered the most. There, the vast expanse of four or five thousand acres of dry land, with few mountains, few trees, little water, few ditches, little manpower, few livestock, and little capital, of course, the conditions for irrigation and flood prevention water conservancy construction are very difficult. However, the people of Anhui were not hindered by the difficulties, and the water conservancy projects completed in the province in more than two months exceeded the total number in the two years since cooperation. On the basis of the victory of completing 800 million cubic meters of earthwork, it was proposed to double it again before spring plowing, adding 800 million cubic meters of earthwork. In just one month after adding the task, the added task was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota, and the work was done faster and with better quality. They have already overfulfilled the water conservancy project of 1.6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone. If these earth and stone are connected one cubic meter by one cubic meter and paved into a traffic road one meter wide and one meter high to the moon, it can be paved more than four times (the earth is 380,000 kilometers away from the moon). What a great achievement. However, the people of Anhui who have invested in this great struggle are becoming more and more enthusiastic and ambitious. They have added another 800 million cubic meters of tasks, and in the tense water conservancy construction movement and rural rectification movement, they have also simultaneously launched a fertilizer accumulation movement, a sanitation movement, a greening movement, and an anti-waste movement; some facts here prove that the potential power of the masses is huge, and several major tasks can not only advance side by side, but also cooperate with each other and encourage each other. Revolutionary drive here makes people more and more energetic, and revolutionary optimism here makes people more and more happy.
    Looking at models, looking at advantages, looking at benefits, looking at potential, looking at all favorable conditions, looking at development prospects; despising difficulties, eliminating backwardness, finding good experiences, good methods, and good examples to overcome all shortcomings and correct various mistakes, and turning negative factors into positive factors; we must strengthen our subjective ambition, and subdue the objective arrogance, give full play to revolutionary optimism, and make everyone's hearts bloom with joy and advance courageously!

　　心花喜放、奋勇向前！
　　季委
    同样一件事，常常有两种完全不同的看法和作法。有了困难，一种人叫苦怕难，裹步不前；一种人认为有困难干起来才有劲，才有味道。有了成绩，一种人满足现状，一种人乘胜挺进，争取更大的战果。一种人暮气沉沉，常常消极悲观，一种人朝气勃勃，充满着革命的乐观情绪。
    需要大大发扬革命的乐观主义，使人民心花怒放，信心百倍，勇气十足，斗志昂扬，越干越有劲！
    有的同志常常喜欢喊叫困难、强调缺点、夸大不利的条件，因而他们总是心情沉重，苦恼万端，寸步维艰，很多工作都是倒数第几名。应该提醒这些同志，给他们鼓劲加油，提高他们的信心，增加他们的勇气，帮助他们找出办法克服困难，使他们也心花怒放起来。
    在任何一个地方工作的同志，都应当安安心心地在那个地方生根、开花、结果，坚持干下去。要越来越热爱这个地方，要培养自己的革命的“爱乡主义”；不只是热爱这个地方的人民，而且热爱这里的一山一水一花一木。一省一县一乡一社的领导同志都应当兴趣勃勃地去熟悉和利用这个地区的一切优越条件，欢欣鼓舞地去发现和培养这个地区的一切好人好事，创造各种各样的模范单位和模范人物。领导同志应当对这些好人好事寄予无限热情的关怀，经常注意他们或者它们的发展；要能够如数家珍似地把他们或者它们的好处生动具体地讲出来，利用各种适宜的机会向所属干部进行宣传鼓动，让全体干部熟悉本地区的好人好事、好乡好社、好厂好矿、好山好水，使得这里的干部越来越感到这个地区可爱，越来越感到能在这里工作是很大的幸福，使他们自然地产生出一种作为这个地区的干部的自豪感。
    看模范，看优点，看有利条件，善于发现和培养一切优良的事物，是发扬革命的乐观主义的一个重要办法。对于这个地方的落后的事物、不良的现象、困难的条件、不利的因素，以及各项工作中的缺点和错误，是不是因为要培养革命的乐观情绪，就应该熟视无睹不闻不问呢？当然不能，应当同时加以重视。但是，应当不要忘记，我们重视这些消极因素，是为了扫除它、消灭它，而发挥一切积极因素正是为了清扫这些消极落后的因素。因而不能孤立地去看消极的因素，不能使干部感到这也是毛病，那也是错误，这里是困难，那里是落后，弄得大家满眼是黑、满心是愁。要在肯定成绩的前提下批判缺点和错误，要在充分认识有利条件的情况下分析不利的条件，要在先进的事物中去找出克服落后现象的经验办法。有这样一些领导同志，当然他们可能在某些方面比下级干部高明些，他们到一个地方，确实能够发现人家没有察觉的缺点，确实能够找出人家没有认识到的毛病，因而他们这也指责、那也批评，这个不对、那个不行。其实，这种领导方法并不高明，因为这样常常会打击干部的情绪、降低别人的工作信心。一个优秀的领导者，到任何地方，他的高明应当首先表现在什么地方呢？应该表现在：他善于发现人家没有发现的好人好事，善于找出人家没有认识到的有利条件。他能帮助下级干部很好地总结和提高这些好人好事的好思想好作风好经验，树立各种各样克服困难和纠正错误的榜样。他也能帮助干部很好地发掘和运用各种有利条件，增加干部战胜困难的信心，教会干部善于改变不利条件为有利条件。因而他不只能敏锐地发现这里的毛病，而且能针对着这里的毛病研究出人家没有想出的经验教训；因而他不只能看出干部的弱点，而且能看出干部的优点，能帮助干部如何去克服自己的弱点。这样的领导者才是促进派的领导者，才是革命乐观情绪的鼓舞者。
    有人认为在经济文化发达的地区工作，条件很好，当然十分高兴，但是在经济文化的发展确实比较落后的地区，条件确实比较困难，怎能叫人也心花怒放起来呢？要使这些同志也心花怒放起来，最好的办法，还是首先找先进看好处。因为任何一个发展比较落后的地方，并不是一切都落后，一定也有很多先进的单位和先进的人物，甚至还有特别突出的好典型。看到了这些先进事物就看到了希望，心花就得到了滋养，就会首先改变对这个地区“什么都不好、什么都落后”的极为不正确的总印象。对于一个地区的经济文化发展的水准和速度，确定它是先进或者落后，主要应该和它的过去作比较，看它是在什么基础上发展起来的，看它是在什么具体条件下发展起来的，只从绝对数目字上去和其他地区进行比较，就不十分公正。从绝对数字看，可能甲地的水准不如乙地，但是从相对比较的数字来看，甲地的发展速度却不一定低于乙地。更重要的，是不能从静止的状态来看一个地区的经济文化情况，要从发展上去看，从它的发展前途去看。看现状，它不如人家，但是看它的潜在力量，看它的富源，看它的宝藏，特别是看它那里的群众条件，就常常是前途远大、希望无穷。比如边远的山区，拿现状来说可能不如靠近城市的平川地区，但是那里不只有用材林木，有经济林木，有果品，有药材，有奇花异草，有珍贵的飞禽野兽，而且地下还有很丰富的矿藏；特别是那里的群众，因为长期处在比较困难的条件下，他们具有和大自然作斗争的丰富经验，有着摆脱贫困状态、建设富饶山区的强烈愿望和顽强的干劲。越是充分估计到这些无穷尽的潜在力量，越是给人们以无限的希望和信心，越是激起人们热爱这些目前比较落后的地区。在这些地区工作的同志，越是这样看待问题，就越会增加对这个地区的热爱，就越能增长革命的乐观情绪。
    对于困难怎样办呢？当然也要正视困难，要对具体的困难进行具体分析。在具体分析困难的时候，要从发展中去看，从克服的过程中去看。当我们没有着手去克服一个困难的时候，看起来困难是很大的，如果我们在这个困难前面止步不前，困难就会永远存在，如果我们不让它躺在我们的前进道路上，以一种奏着凯歌上战场的精神去和它斗争，情况就会在斗争中发生显著的变化。不只是这个困难会逐渐被克服，主要是我们的主观战斗力在斗争中会得到不断地提高，越战斗条件越好，越战斗经验越多，特别是在集小胜为大胜、在一个胜利接一个胜利的情况下，群众的斗争信心和斗争热情会越来越高涨。原来看起来很大的困难，就不在话下，原来认为很难完成的任务，就微乎其微。这次在很多地区的水利建设运动中所创造出来的巨大奇迹，就充分说明了这个问题。安徽省在历史上就是一个不旱就涝、灾害重重的省份，特别是淮北地区受灾最重，那里一望无际的四五千万亩旱川地带，山少树少水少沟少，人力少牲畜少资金少，在这里进行灌溉和防涝的水利建设，当然条件是十分困难的。但是安徽人民并没有被困难阻挡着去路，全省在两个多月内完成的水利工程就超过合作化以来两年的总数，在完成八亿土方的胜利基础上提出在春耕前再翻一翻，追加八亿土方的任务。在追加任务以后仅仅一个月，又提前超额完成了追加任务，干得速度更快、质量更好。他们已经超额完成了十六亿土石方的水利工程，如果把这些土石方一公方一公方的连接起来，铺成一条一公尺宽一公尺高的通往月球的交通大道，可以铺成四条还多（地球距月球三十八万公里），这是多么伟大的成就。但是投入这一伟大斗争中的安徽人民，干劲越来越大，志气越来越高，他们又追加了八亿公方的任务，而且在紧张的水利建设运动和农村整风运动中，又同时开展了积肥运动、卫生运动、绿化运动和反浪费运动；这里的若干事实证明，群众的潜在力量是巨大的，几种主要工作齐头并进不只可能，而且还能彼此配合、互相鼓舞。革命的干劲在这里使人们越来越精力充沛，革命的乐观主义在这里使人们越来越喜笑颜开。
    看模范，看优点，看好处，看潜力，看一切有利条件，看发展前途；蔑视困难，消灭落后，找出克服一切缺点和纠正各种错误的好经验好办法好典型，把消极因素变为积极因素；要长主观的志气，灭客观的威风，充分发挥革命的乐观主义，使人人心花喜放，奋勇向前！
