　　The Story of Lead
  　　Miyang
    For a long time, archaeologists have been puzzled by the fact that the skeletons of people from a certain period in ancient Rome, when excavated, are different from ordinary remains, often bearing a peculiar black stain. However, the bones of people from earlier or later periods at the same site do not exhibit this phenomenon at all. After chemical analysis, it was found that the bones with black stains contained a particularly high amount of lead, while the bones of people from other countries or other periods in Rome contained almost no lead. This result made people even more puzzled: why did the bones of people from this period alone contain so much lead? Why was this lead concentrated in the bones? Archaeologists spent a lot of effort trying to solve this problem. The first thing that caught their attention was the large number of lead pipes often found in the ruins of ancient Roman cities. The riddle seemed to be solved: the ancient Romans used lead pipes to transport tap water, and people must have been poisoned by lead. But the final solution to this problem was only recently discovered. It turns out that when lead interacts with water containing carbon dioxide, a very small portion is dissolved. After this trace amount of lead enters the human body, it partially replaces the calcium in the bones and remains in the bones forever. Over time, the amount of lead increases. After a person dies, the sulfur in the muscles is decomposed, and it interacts with the lead in the bones to form black lead sulfide stains. People from earlier times did not know how to make lead pipes, while people from later times already knew how to use iron pipes, so their skeletons did not exhibit the above phenomenon.
    Two or three centuries ago, when people's knowledge of chemistry was still very shallow, another matter caused archaeologists and even artists a great deal of trouble: why were the portraits in murals or clay sculptures found in ancient buildings or caves always with black faces? Historical documents have never recorded that ancient people liked to use black to paint portraits! Later, it was learned that almost all the painters in the ancient world used lead white (basic lead carbonate) for all the pigments used to paint portraits. Over time, it gradually reacted with the sulfur in the air to form lead sulfide and turned black. Although the reason was found, in the end, we cannot see the original appearance of the works. Can we restore the original colors without damaging the original painting at all? People tried their best, and the problem was finally solved: just soak the blackened part in very dilute hydrogen peroxide, because hydrogen peroxide can oxidize the black lead sulfide into lead sulfate.
    Now, the position of lead is becoming more and more important. It is simply unimaginable for general light and heavy industries or national defense industries to lack lead.
    Lead has the special ability to block radiation emitted by radioactive materials, so it is often used as a protective layer in the atomic energy industry to protect workers from harm. Doctors who perform X-ray fluoroscopy for patients in hospitals often wear large aprons, which also contain lead.
    Pure lead has a strong resistance to chemical corrosion, so chemical reactions are often carried out in lead boxes in the sulfuric acid manufacturing industry. This method of manufacturing sulfuric acid is called the "lead chamber process."
    An important use of lead is to manufacture storage batteries. Each lead-acid battery requires dozens of pounds of lead. If you think about how every airplane, car, tractor, and tank... must have at least one storage battery, then the amount of lead used is staggering. With the further development of China's industrialization, the demand for lead will increase even more sharply.
    In the national defense industry, lead is often used to manufacture bullets because lead has a high specific gravity, which can increase kinetic energy when fired. Lead containing 0.5% arsenic is much harder than pure lead, and it is often used to manufacture shot pellets.
    As for lead compounds, the Chinese have been using them for a long time, especially those alchemists and physicians, and their application range is even wider today.
    Massicot (lead monoxide) has long been an effective medicine for treating eczema and burns. In addition, a mixture of dry massicot and glycerin is a strange adhesive that can bond almost anything together, such as stone, metal, glass, bakelite, etc., and it is also airtight after bonding. This adhesive is often used in the radio industry to glue the bulbs and bases of electron tubes together.
    Some lead compounds are also often used to replace calcium in ordinary glass to make "lead glass," which is the general so-called optical glass. It is an indispensable material in the manufacture of telescopes, microscopes, and other optical instruments.
    In the pigment industry, lead compounds also occupy a fairly important position. Lead white is generally no longer used much because it easily turns black. Lead chromate, called "chrome yellow," is still an excellent yellow pigment because of its stable properties. Lead iodide is similar to tin sulfide and is often used as a gold pigment. Lead iodide has a finer texture than tin sulfide and is often used in printing.
    Lead is toxic, and typesetting workers are most susceptible to lead poisoning, so factories should pay special attention to ventilation and personal hygiene after work. The initial signs of lead poisoning are graying of the gum edges, inflammation of the cornea, abdominal pain, etc., and continued development can cause neurological disorders. Currently, toothpaste containers are made of a compound of lead and tin. In general, this is not very good, but because the amount of lead dissolved in the toothpaste is very small, and it is always rinsed away with water in the mouth, very little enters the human body, and generally does not cause lead poisoning.

    铅的故事
  　米扬
    很久以来一直使得考古学家感到迷惑的一个问题就是：发掘出来古罗马某一时期的人的骨胳同一般尸骨不同，经常带有一种特殊的黑斑。可是同一地点的更古远一些或者更晚近一些人的骨胳上却又完全没有这种现象。经过化学分析以后，发现带黑斑的骨胳里铅的含量特别多，而别国人或者其他时期的罗马人的骨胳中却几乎一点也不含铅。这个结果使得人们更加迷惑了：为什么独有这一时期人的骨中含有这么多铅？为什么这些铅又偏偏都集中在骨头里？为了解决这个问题，考古家曾花费了不少劳动。首先引起他们注意的就是从罗马古城废墟中常常发现大量的铅管。谜语似乎被揭穿了，古罗马人都是用铅管输送自来水的，人一定中了铅毒。但这问题的最终解决还是不久以前的事。原来铅和含有二氧化碳的水起作用后就有极小一部分被溶解下来，这微量的铅进入人体以后，就把骨中的钙部分地代换出来，并且永远存于骨中，日积月累，铅的数量可就多了。人死以后，肌肉中的硫被分解出来，它和骨中的铅起作用就形成了一块块黑色的硫化铅斑痕。更古一些的人，他们还不会制造铅管，而晚近一些的人却已经会使用铁管了，因此他们的尸骨就没有上述的现象。
    两三世纪以前，当人们的化学知识还很浅薄的时候，另一件事情又使得考古学家甚至美术家大伤脑筋：为什么古代建筑或洞窟中发现的壁画或泥塑中的人像都是黑脸？历史文献中也从来没有记载过古代人喜欢用黑色来画人像呀！后来才知道，古代几乎世界上所有的画家画人像时所有的颜料都是铅白（碱式碳酸铅），日子一长，它就同空气中含的硫逐渐生成硫化铅而变成黑色。原因尽管找到，可是终究看不到作品的原来面目了，到底还能不能丝毫不损原画而又使它回复当年的色彩呢？人们费尽了心思，问题总算得到了解决：只要用很稀的双氧水去浸洗变黑的部分就行了，这是因为双氧水能将黑色的硫化铅氧化变成硫酸铅的原故。
    现在铅的地位愈来愈显得重要，一般轻重工业或者国防工业如果缺少铅那简直是不堪想像的事。
    铅对于放射性物质发出来的射线有特殊阻挡的本领，因此在原子能工业中常常用铅来作保护层使工作人员免受伤害。医院中替病人作爱克斯光透视的医生常常穿着大围裙，这中间也夹着铅。
    纯铅抗化学药品腐蚀的能力很强，因此在制造硫酸的工业中常常使化学反应在铅制的箱内进行。这种制造硫酸的方法称为“铅室法”。
    铅的一个重要用途就是用来制造蓄电池，每一个铅制蓄电池需用铅好几十斤，大家如果想到每一架飞机、汽车、拖拉机和坦克……至少都要有一个蓄电池的话，那么铅的用量该有多么惊人。随着我国工业化进一步开展，铅的需要量更会直线上升。
    国防工业中铅常被用来制造枪弹的弹头，这是因为铅的比重很大，发射时可以增加动能的原故。含0.5％砷的铅比纯铅的硬度要大好多倍，它经常被用来制造猎枪子弹的弹丸。
    至于铅的化合物，中国人很早就在使用了，特别是那些炼丹家和医药学家，在目前它的应用范围更加广阔了。
    密陀僧（一氧化铅）自古以来一直是治疗湿疹和烧伤的有效药。此外，干燥的密陀僧和甘油的混合物是一种古怪的粘合剂，它几乎能把任何东西粘在一块，诸如石头，金属，玻璃，电木等，粘合后并且还密不透气。无线电工业中经常用这种粘合剂把电子管的灯泡和灯座粘在一起。
    铅的一些化合物也常用来代替普通玻璃中的钙而制成“铅玻璃”，这就是一般所谓的光学玻璃。它是制造望远镜、显微镜等光学仪器中不可缺少的材料。
    在颜料工业中铅的化合物也占有相当重要的地位。铅白由于容易变黑，一般已不大用它。一种称为“铬黄”的铬酸铅由于性质稳定，仍然是一种优良的黄色颜料。碘化铅和硫化锡相似，是经常被用作金色颜料的。碘化铅比硫化锡的质地更为细密，印刷上常用到它。
    铅是有毒的，排字工人最易中铅毒，因此工厂内应当特别注意通风，下班后经常注意个人卫生。铅中毒最初的征兆是牙床边缘变成灰色，眼角膜发炎，腹痛等，继续发展即会引起神经错乱。目前牙膏的容器都是铅与锡合成的，总的说来这是不太好的，不过因为铅溶入牙膏中的量很微小，同时在口中总是被水漱掉，很少进入人体，一般不致因此而中铅毒。
