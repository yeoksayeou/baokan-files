Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 20th: The Delhi City Peace Council held a mass rally in Delhi on the afternoon of February 19th, demanding the earliest possible convocation of a top-level meeting attended by heads of governments from various countries.

Indian renowned writer Mulk Raj Anand said at the meeting that the current situation makes such high-level talks even more urgently needed because at the recent Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council, efforts were made to transport atomic weapons to Asia. The people of Asia and Africa must loudly support the demand for a top-level meeting.

The resolution passed at the meeting pointed out that holding lower-level preparatory meetings before holding a top-level meeting is useless.

Another resolution passed at the meeting condemned the recent atrocities of French aircraft bombing Tunisian villages and demanded that France withdraw all its troops from Tunisia and Algeria.

General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ajoy Ghosh, expressed his support at the meeting for the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference's demand for moral assistance to the Algerian National Liberation Front.

He said that imperialists must know that the world has changed, and acts of aggression against the people of Asia and Africa cannot be tolerated.

Famous French peace activist Fernand Viau sharply condemned military blocs, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, at the meeting.

    德里和平理事会举行群众集会
    要求尽早召开最高级会议
    据新华社新德里20日电　德里市和平理事会2月19日下午在德里举行了群众集会，要求尽早召开有各国政府首脑参加的最高级会议。
    印度著名作家穆尔克拉志·阿南德在会上说，目前的形势更加迫切需要举行这种高级会谈，因为在最近举行的巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议上，人们曾竭力要把原子武器运到亚洲来。亚非人民必须大声疾呼地支持举行最高级会议的要求。
    这个集会上通过的决议指出，在举行最高级会议以前，先举行低级的预备会议是没有用处的。
    会上通过的另一项决议谴责了最近法国飞机轰炸突尼斯村庄的暴行，并且要求法国从突尼斯和阿尔及利亚撤出一切军队。
    印度共产党总书记高士在会上表示支持亚非人民团结大会提出的关于给予阿尔及利亚民族阵线以道义援助的要求。
    他说，帝国主义者必须知道，世界已经改变了，对亚非人民的侵略行为是决不能容忍的。
    法国著名和平人士费南·维?在会上尖锐地谴责了包括北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约在内的军事集团。
