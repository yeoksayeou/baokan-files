    Notes

    Near and Far
    Marvin Stone, Director of the Far East Bureau of the International News Service, said that one of the "main reasons" the United States opposes the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea is that "it is obvious that the Chinese only need to withdraw north of the Yalu River" to fulfill such a deal. The implication is that China is close to Korea, while the United States is far away. After the withdrawal, it would be easier for Chinese troops to return to Korea than for American troops.
    This is a very old argument. The United States has long used this untenable reason to refuse to withdraw its troops from South Korea. According to this reasoning, South Korea can only be permanently under American occupation, because the geographical situation of Korea being close to China and far from the United States can never be changed.
    But Mr. Stone has forgotten one thing: the people of all countries demand that the American invading forces withdraw from South Korea, without allowing them to come back at any time. Therefore, worrying about the long distance is completely unnecessary.

    近和远
    国际新闻社远东分社社长马文·斯通说，美国所以反对从朝鲜撤退外国军队，“主要原因之一是：很明显，中国人要履行这样的交易只需撤到鸭绿江以北”就可以了。言下之意是，中国离朝鲜近，美国离朝鲜远，撤退以后美军要再来朝鲜不如中国军队方便。
    这是一种十分陈旧的论调了。美国长久以来就拿这种站不住脚的理由拒绝从南朝鲜撤军。根据这种理由，南朝鲜就只能永远处于美国的占领之下，因为朝鲜离中国近而离美国远的地理情况是永远改变不了的。
    但是斯通先生忘记了一点：各国人民要求美国侵略军从南朝鲜撤退，并没有允许他们什么时候卷土重来，因此，为路途遥远担心是完全多余的。
