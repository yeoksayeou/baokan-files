Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: A nationwide comprehensive League consolidation effort is underway in the rural branches of the Communist Youth League. Preliminary statistics indicate that 150,000 branches have already undergone consolidation, 300,000 branches are currently undergoing consolidation, and the remaining 120,000 branches will commence consolidation successively. The League branches have displayed a new atmosphere after consolidation.

This League consolidation effort is being conducted in close conjunction with the rural rectification movement, on the basis of extensive airing of views, blooming, and great debate. After the commencement of the rectification movement, the League organizations have paid attention to mobilizing League members to actively participate in extensive airing of views, blooming, and great debate alongside the masses. During the extensive airing of views, blooming, and great debate, the majority of League members have performed well, resolutely supporting the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist road, actively struggling against all words and deeds opposing the Party's leadership and opposing socialism, once again proving that the Communist Youth League is the Party's reliable assistant. However, the extensive airing of views, blooming, and great debate have also exposed that a very small number of anti-socialist elements, class alien elements, serious law-breaking and discipline-violating elements, and various bad elements exist within the League; some League members have vague stances and cannot distinguish between friend and foe; some League members harbor varying degrees of bourgeois individualism; and a small number of League branches are in a state of disarray.

League organizations in various regions are universally employing the method of extensive airing of views, blooming, and great debate to solve various problems existing within the League. Many League branches are organizing League members to universally conduct airing of views within the League, so that the vast majority of League members can express everything they want to say, achieving ideological communion. For political and ideological problems existing among League members, League organizations are conducting debates within the League using the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and persuading people with reason. For some problems in the work of the League branches, the method of extensive airing of views, blooming, and great debate is also used to solve them.

In the League consolidation work, various regions are closely combining ideological consolidation with organizational consolidation. League organizations first focused on examining the political stance of League members, criticizing the capitalist thoughts and behaviors of some League members. While conducting ideological consolidation, anti-socialist elements and various bad elements who have infiltrated the League are being thoroughly exposed and criticized, and then expelled from the League. League members who have made mistakes are given education or disciplinary action according to the seriousness of their offenses. Individuals who are extremely backward, incorrigible despite repeated education, and completely unqualified to be League members are advised to withdraw from the League or have their League membership revoked.

The vast majority of branches that have completed League consolidation have re-elected their branch committees, adjusted the composition of the branch committees, and strengthened the leadership core of the branches. According to statistics, more than 80% of the new League branch cadres are from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds.

After the League consolidation, the work of the League organization has made great leaps forward, the ideological style of League members and League cadres has undergone significant changes, and the political enthusiasm and production drive of League members have also greatly increased. According to preliminary statistics from various regions, after League consolidation, the proportion of Communist Youth League branches in rural areas that are well-organized and actively working has increased from about 30% to more than 50%, and the proportion of branches that are working relatively backward has decreased from about 20% to about 5%. According to statistics from eight provinces and cities, including Hebei and Beijing, the advanced elements among League members have increased from 37% to more than 60%, and the backward elements have decreased from about 20% to about 5%. League members in many places have proposed to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production with the determination of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and the courage of "Wu Song beating the Tiger."

　　用大辩论的办法解决团内各种问题
    全国农村普遍进行整团
    据新华社31日讯　全国农村的共青团支部正在普遍进行整团工作。据初步统计，目前已经有十五万个支部进行了整顿，有三十万个支部正在整顿，其余十二万个支部也将陆续开始整顿。经过整顿后的团支部都出现了新的气象。
    这次整团工作是紧密地结合农村整风运动，在大鸣大放大辩论的基础上进行的。整风运动开始后，团的组织就注意发动团员积极和群众一起进行大鸣大放大辩论。在大鸣大放大辩论中，大部分团员表现是好的，他们坚决拥护共产党的领导和走社会主义的道路，积极地同各种反对党的领导和反对社会主义的言行进行斗争，再一次证明了共青团是党的可靠的助手。但是，经过大鸣大放大辩论，也暴露出团内有极少数反社会主义分子、阶级异己分子、严重违法乱纪分子和各种坏分子；有些团员立场模糊，划不清敌我界限；有些团员存在着程度不同的资产阶级个人主义思想；有一小部分团支部处于涣散状态。
    各地团组织普遍运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法来解决团内存在的各种问题。许多团支部在团内组织团员普遍进行鸣放，使绝大多数团员都把要说的话说尽，做到思想见面。对于团员中存在的政治上、思想上的问题，团组织用摆事实，讲道理，以理服人的方法在团内展开辩论。对于团支部工作中的一些问题，也运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法来加以解决。
    在整团工作中，各地都把思想整顿和组织整顿密切结合进行。团组织首先着重检查了团员的政治立场，批判了一些团员的资本主义思想和行为。在思想整顿的同时，对于混入团内的反社会主义分子和各种坏分子都在经过彻底的揭露和批判后，清除出团。对于犯有错误的团员根据情节轻重分别给以教育或纪律处分。对于个别极端落后、屡教不改、完全不够团员条件的人，就劝告他们退团或者开除他们的团籍。
    已经结束整团工作的支部，绝大多数都改选了支部委员会，调整了支部委员的成分，加强了支部的领导核心。据统计，新的团支部干部中，有80％以上是贫农和下中农。
    经过整团后，团组织的工作有了很大的跃进，团员和团干部的思想作风有了显著的改变，团员的政治热情和生产干劲也大大高涨。据各地的初步统计，经过整团后，农村中组织健全、工作活跃的共青团支部由30％左右上升到50％以上，工作比较落后的支部由20％左右下降到5％左右。又据河北、北京等八个省、市的统计，团员中先进部分已由37％上升到60％以上，落后部分由20％左右下降到5％左右。许多地方的团员提出了要以“愚公移山”的决心和“武松打虎”的勇气来力争农业生产的大跃进。
