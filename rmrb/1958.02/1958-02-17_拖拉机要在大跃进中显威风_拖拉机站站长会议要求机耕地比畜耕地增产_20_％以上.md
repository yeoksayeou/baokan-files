Xinhua News Agency, 16th - In order to actively organize the agricultural production Great Leap Forward in the tractor station service areas and to continuously reduce the cost of mechanized farming operations, the recently concluded National Agricultural Machine Tractor Station Directors' Meeting summarized and exchanged the achievements, experiences, and shortcomings of tractor station work nationwide during the first Five-Year Plan period, and proposed improvement measures. Among the one hundred and forty-six station directors attending the meeting, twenty-one have already put forward initiatives for socialist competition to organize the production Great Leap Forward in the service area and reduce operating costs.

During the first Five-Year Plan period, the work of China's tractor stations developed rapidly, with great achievements, and accumulated relatively rich experience. During this period, the Changzhi Station (Shanxi Province) and Mowei Station (Shaanxi Province), which paid attention to diligence and thrift in running the station, emerged; the Maoling Station (Shaanxi Province), which achieved unified arrangements and comprehensive guidance, resulting in increased production year after year; the Huaide Bayi Station (Jilin Province), which carried out multiple operations and was welcomed by farmers; the Shenyang Station (Liaoning Province), which achieved both increased production and facilitated mechanized farming through rational land planning; the Sucheng Station (Anhui Province), which achieved results in modifying farm implements to meet increased production requirements; the Huanghua Station (Hebei Province), which used its own machines to transform a bitter sea into a granary; and the Linyi Station (Shanxi Province), which ensured safe production and had no accidents for three years.

The meeting pointed out that with the continuous development of national industrialization, in addition to actively improving and enriching existing old stations, new stations will be developed in suitable areas in a planned way in the future. In order to run the existing tractor stations well, this meeting first required all tractor stations nationwide to generally increase production on mechanized land by more than 20% compared to local animal-cultivated land in 1958, based on the local Great Leap Forward targets, and to achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule on one-third to one-half of the mechanized farming area. Each station should also cultivate high-yield demonstration fields of more than a thousand mu. The meeting also emphasized that all tractor stations should adhere to the policy of "building the country diligently and thriftily, and running the stations diligently and thriftily." It is required that in 1958, each station, as a unit, should achieve a balance between production costs and operational income, with a surplus; more than half of the stations nationwide should calculate fixed asset depreciation fees and achieve a balance of payments. It is required that all stations nationwide calculate fixed asset depreciation fees within the next one or two years, achieve a balance of payments, and have a surplus. The meeting believed that achieving the above tasks is arduous but possible and must be done. The meeting pointed out the favorable conditions for achieving the above tasks.

This meeting also focused on the management methods of agricultural machinery in China. During the first Five-Year Plan period, regarding the management methods of agricultural machinery, the "state-owned, commune-operated" management method emerged, in which tractors and agricultural machinery were handed over to agricultural cooperatives for operation and use, and the tractor station only collected depreciation fees, with the machinery still owned by the state (the Beijing Tractor Station has been piloting this for a year), and the "commune-owned, commune-operated" method, in which agricultural cooperatives funded the purchase of tractors and agricultural machinery (the Xingye Cooperative in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, has been piloting this for a year). The meeting believed that these two management methods have vitality and were generated based on China's economic conditions and social conditions. The meeting required that in 1958, pilot projects be actively set up in areas with suitable conditions to create conditions for promoting this method in the future. However, the meeting also specifically pointed out that the existing "state-owned, state-operated" management method of tractor stations is still the main one at present, and every effort must be made to run it well.

    拖拉机要在大跃进中显威风
    拖拉机站站长会议要求机耕地比畜耕地增产20％以上
    据新华社16日讯　为了积极组织拖拉机站服务区的农业生产大跃进和不断地降低机耕作业成本，最近闭幕的全国农业机器拖拉机站站长会议总结交流了第一个五年计划时期全国拖拉机站工作的成绩、经验和缺点，提出了改进办法。出席会议的一百四十六个站长中，有二十一个已经提出了组织服务区生产大跃进和降低作业成本的社会主义竞赛的倡议书。
    在第一个五年计划时期我国拖拉机站工作发展迅速，成绩很大，积累了较丰富的经验。在此时期，出现了注意勤俭办站的长治站（山西省）、马嵬站（陕西省）；做到统一安排，全面指导，因而连年增产的茂陵站（陕西省）；开展多项作业，受到农民欢迎的怀德八一站（吉林省）；在合理规划土地上，做到既利增产、又利机耕的沈阳站（辽宁省）；适应增产要求，改装机具有成绩的宿城站（安徽省）；用自己的机器，使苦海变粮仓的黄骅站（河北省）和安全生产，三年无事故的临猗站（山西省）等。
    会议指出随着国家工业化的不断发展，今后除积极提高与充实现有老站外，在适宜地区还将有计划地发展新站。为了把现有的拖拉机站办好，这次会议首先要求全国各拖拉机站1958年在当地跃进指标的基础上，机耕地一般比当地畜耕地增产20％以上，并在三分之一到二分之一的机耕面积上提前实现全国农业发展纲要的指标，各站还应培养千亩以上的高额丰产田。会议还强调指出，各拖拉机站要坚持“勤俭建国，勤俭办站”的方针。要求1958年以站为单位做到生产费用和作业报酬收支相抵，并有盈余；全国要有半数以上的站，计算固定资产折旧费，达到收支相抵。要求在今后一年或者两年之内全国各站都计算固定资产折旧费，达到收支平衡，并有盈余。会议认为实现上述任务是艰巨的，但是可能的，必须做到的。会议指出了实现上述任务的有利条件。
    这次会议还着重对我国农业机械的经营方式进行了研究。第一个五年计划时期在农业机械的经营方式上，出现了把拖拉机、农业机械交给农业社经营使用，拖拉机站只收折旧费，机械仍为国家所有的“国有社营”的经营方式（北京拖拉机站已经试行一年）和由农业社出资购买拖拉机、农业机械的“社有社营”的方式（黑龙江省拜泉县兴业社已经试办一年）。会议认为，这两种经营方式是具有生命力的，它是根据我国的经济情况和社会条件产生的。会议要求1958年在有条件的地区积极布点试验，为以后推行这种方式创造条件。但是会议也特别指出，现有拖拉机站的经营方式“国有国营”目前仍是主要的，必须千方百计把它办好。
