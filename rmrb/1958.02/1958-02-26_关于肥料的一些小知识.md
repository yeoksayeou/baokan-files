Some Small Knowledge About Fertilizers

    Why can't ammonium nitrate fertilizer be mixed with lime and wood ash?

    The People's Daily published an article on page 3 on January 23 this year, "How to Transport and Store Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer," which stated: "Ammonium nitrate cannot be mixed with lime and wood ash to avoid reducing fertilizer effectiveness." Why? Because ammonium nitrate, as a fertilizer, utilizes the nitrogen it contains. Half of the nitrogen in ammonium nitrate exists in nitric acid, and the other half exists in ammonium. Ammonium has a characteristic that when it encounters alkaline substances, it undergoes a chemical change and releases free gaseous ammonia. In this way, nitrogen is also released into the air as part of gaseous ammonia. If there are enough alkaline substances, all the nitrogen in the ammonium will turn into ammonia gas. Therefore, ammonium nitrate cannot be used together with alkaline fertilizers such as lime and wood ash.

    By the same token, all fertilizers containing ammonia, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and human and animal urine, should not be mixed with alkaline substances during storage and use, just like ammonium nitrate. If mixed together, all the nitrogen in ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride will be lost, rendering them ineffective as fertilizers.

    Raw Manure Cannot Fertilize Fields

    The excrement of humans and other animals contains a large amount of nitrogen, so it is a good fertilizer. However, raw manure that has not been fermented cannot be used to fertilize fields. This is because plants cannot directly absorb the nitrogen in raw manure. It must be mixed with an appropriate amount of sludge, leaves, and water, and left for a certain period of time to rot and ferment before it can be used. Fermentation involves the mass reproduction of bacteria in the manure, which decomposes the organic matter in the manure, partially transforming it into soluble nitrogen-containing salts, which can then be absorbed by the roots of plants as nutrients. At the same time, manure often contains urine, which is alkaline. If it is used to fertilize fields without fermentation, it will cause the soil to become alkaline. Many plants cannot grow well in alkaline soil. After fermentation, urea decomposes into nitrogen-containing salts, and the soil will not become alkaline. (Ji)

    Why can wall soil or kang soil be used as fertilizer?

    The kangs (heated brick beds) in rural areas are connected to the cooking stove, and the chimney passes through the inside of the kang. The smoke from burning firewood for cooking every day also passes through the chimney. After the plant proteins in the firewood are burned, the nitrogen element in them turns into ammonia gas and is released. The kang soil absorbs this ammonia gas through the chimney. The kang soil that has been smoked for a long time can be used as nitrogen fertilizer, with a potency four to five times higher than that of ordinary river mud.

    After long-term wind, sun, and rain, rural earthen walls often have many white frost-like substances at the base, which are nitrate substances. Nitrate contains a lot of nitrogen, so it can also be used as fertilizer. Comparative tests have shown that using this kind of old wall soil as fertilizer is two to three times more effective than ordinary river mud. In many rural areas in the north, the kang is dismantled once in late winter and early spring, which not only increases the source of fertilizer but also serves as a cleaning and sanitation measure, which is indeed a good experience that serves two purposes.

    关于肥料的一些小知识
    为什么硝酸铵肥料不能与石灰和草木灰混在一起使用？
    人民日报今年1月23日第三版刊登的“怎样运输和保管硝酸铵肥料”，一文中说：“硝酸铵不能和石灰、草木灰混在一起，以免降低肥效”。为什么呢？因为硝酸铵作为肥料，是利用其中所含的氮。硝酸铵中的氮，有一半存在于硝酸中，另一半则存在于铵中。铵有一个特性，就是当它遇到碱性物质时，就会发生化学变化，而能放出游离的气体氨（又叫阿摩尼亚）。这样氮也就作为气体氨的一部分而逸散在空气里。如果碱性物质足够多的时候，铵中的氮就会全部变成氨气。因此不能把硝酸铵同碱性肥料——石灰、草木灰等一起使用。
    同样道理，凡含有氨的肥料如硫酸铵、?砂（氯化铵）和人畜尿等都和硝酸铵一样，在存放和使用的时候，都不能和碱性物质混在一起。如果混在一起，硫酸铵和氯化铵中的氮将会全部丢失而无肥效。

    生粪不能肥田
    人和其他动物的粪便内含有大量的氮素，所以是很好的肥料。但是没有经过发酵的生粪却不能用来肥田。因为植物不能直接吸收生粪里的氮素，须在粪便中加入适量的污泥、树叶和水搅拌后放置一定时间使之腐烂发酵才能用。发酵，是粪便内的细菌大量繁殖，能分解粪便内的有机物，使之部分变成可以溶解的含氮盐类，这才能被植物的根部吸收成为养料。同时粪便中往往夹杂着尿，带有碱性如未经发酵即用之肥田，就会使土地起碱。许多植物不能在碱土里很好地生长。发酵后尿素分解成含氮盐类，土地就不会起碱了。　（吉）
    墙土或炕土为什么能作肥料？
    农村的炕都是同锅台连在一起的，烟筒就从炕里面通过。每天煮菜烧饭所烧柴草的烟也都要经过烟筒。柴草中的植物蛋白质燃烧之后，其中的氮元素变为氨气放出，炕土借着烟筒的作用吸收了这种氨气，长期经烟熏过的炕土就可用作氮肥，效力比一般河泥高四到五倍。
    农村的土墙经过长期风吹、日晒、雨淋后，在墙根常发现许多像碱一样的白霜，这就是硝酸盐类的物质。硝酸盐含有许多氮元素，所以也可以作肥料。经比较证明用这种多年的墙土作肥料，比一般河泥的肥效高两、三倍。北方的许多农村在冬末春初时都要扒一次炕，一方面增加了肥源，另一方面又作了清洁卫生工作，确是一举两得的好经验。
