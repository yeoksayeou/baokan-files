    "In the Angmena Tribe"

    "In the Angmena Tribe" depicts the story of the People's Liberation Army marching into the Kachin mountains on the southwestern border to suppress bandits and liberate the Angmena tribe. Due to the long-term blockade of the Kachin mountains by the reactionary government, the Kachin people harbored deep hatred for the outside world. Coupled with the conspiracies and sabotage of the bandits, these factors made it difficult to liberate this beautiful land. However, the invincible People's Liberation Army finally overcame various difficulties and liberated this mysterious land.

    The novel portrays many distinct characters, including a strong and composed political instructor, a squad leader who is infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause, and vivid images of soldiers. They are brave, agile, and full of revolutionary optimism, but each also has their own shortcomings. Particularly noteworthy are the images of several Kachin people. Let us see how the gentle and beautiful Kachin girl Nani slaps her lover - a traitor - across the face; how the kind and resolute Kachin elder Yan Kan jumps off a cliff to capture the enemy of the nation - the nephew he raised.

    The descriptions of the beautiful natural scenery and rich national characteristics are also a feature of this novel.

    “在昂美纳部落里”
    “在昂美纳部落里”描写了人民解放军进军西南边境的佧佤山剿匪和解放昂美纳部落的故事。由于长期以来反动政府对佧佤山的封锁，佧佤族人民对外界的仇恨很深，加以土匪的阴谋破坏，这些都给解放这块美丽的土地造成了困难。但是无坚不摧的人民解放军终于克服了种种困难，解放了这个神秘的国土。
    小说刻划了不少性格鲜明的人物，有坚强镇静的指导员，有对革命事业无比忠诚的班长，也有栩栩如生的战士形象，他们勇敢、矫捷，充满了革命乐观主义精神，但也有各自不同的缺点。其中特别令人注目的，是几个佧佤人民的形象。让我们看看温柔美丽的佧佤姑娘娜妮是怎样把沉重的耳光打在情人——叛徒的脸上；慈祥、坚毅的佧佤老人岩坎是怎样跳下崖去抓住民族的仇敌——自己抚育过的外甥。
    幽美的自然景物的描写和富有浓郁的民族色彩，也是这部小说一个特色。
                            （裴雯）
