Heroic Spirit Soaring, Rivers and Mountains Change Color
　　Fujian Strives to Become a Thousand-Jin Province in Five Years
　　(Our dispatch from Fuzhou, February 5th) The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Fujian Province put forward four slogans full of revolutionary vigor and heroic spirit: To achieve a great leap forward in thinking, a great leap forward in targets, and also to achieve a great leap forward in measures and a great leap forward in work style. The meeting put forward a great leap forward plan to achieve the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within five years.
　　The meeting demanded that by 1962, the average grain yield per mu in the province should reach more than 800 jin, striving to achieve a "Thousand-Jin Province" (currently less than 480 jin). In 1962, the total output value of local industry in the province should reach about 3 billion yuan (currently only 210 million yuan), and the proportion of modern industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value should increase from the current 17.2% to about 40%. In addition, within five years, the province should build 6,000 kilometers of highways and 10,000 kilometers of mountain roads, so that all major towns and townships in the province are accessible by highways, and most agricultural cooperatives are accessible by roads; basically eliminate barren mountains and complete greening; eliminate the "four pests" and strive to become a "four-without province"; ensure that every cooperative has a primary school, every township has a complete primary school, every district has a junior high school, and every county has a complete high school, and at the same time, eliminate illiteracy among the province's young and middle-aged people. A province that is almost entirely mountainous and economically relatively backward will, after five years of hard work, achieve a complete change in its appearance.
　　This meeting lasted for fifty-eight days and successfully concluded on January 30. The meeting correctly analyzed the current revolutionary situation and severely criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking existing within the Party. As the representatives said, this is a promoting conference.
　　The meeting believed that some comrades held a "more or less" guiding ideology to view the past work and envision the future undertakings. The manifestation of this type of person is that they become arrogant and complacent with a little achievement, no longer want to move forward, their thinking is solidified, and their hands and feet are also slow. Especially after working hard for a while, they want to stop and rest. Their main problem is that they only look backward and not forward, believing that the law of development of the revolutionary cause is not a leap forward promoting a leap forward, but a leap forward stopping and then a leap forward. Another part of the comrades waver and are unstable in the revolutionary process. When the climate is favorable to them and the work is smooth, they can exert effort; when they encounter difficulties and contradictions, they complain about this and that, this is not right and that is not right. The problem with this type of person is that they only look at negative factors and ignore positive factors; they exaggerate local unfavorable factors and reduce universal favorable factors. Their thoughts on the Party's call are clear today, but unclear tomorrow, and their enthusiasm fluctuates like waves. There is also a type of comrade who has no sense of awareness and responsibility for the revolutionary cause. The meeting strictly criticized these erroneous ideas, advocated and promoted the spirit of continuous revolution, opposed mediocrity, and believed that people who embrace mediocrity look stable, but in reality, they lack revolutionary vigor, and developing in this way will inevitably lead to the danger of falling behind. The meeting criticized those who are timid and bow their heads to difficulties, believing that those who avoid difficulties do so because they do not know that things develop in constant contradictions, one contradiction will lead to another contradiction, old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions will arise. Continuous revolution is to continuously solve the contradictions before us, continuously promote the development of things, and only by always maintaining revolutionary vigor and revolutionary enthusiasm can we adapt to the needs of the development of the revolutionary situation.
　　In order to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program targets five years ahead of schedule, the meeting demanded that this year's grain output reach 10 billion jin, an increase of 14.2% compared to 1957, and an average yield of more than 500 jin per mu. This year, the province will have eleven grain thousand-jin counties (cities) and seven grain eight-hundred-jin counties (cities). The Longxi Special District proposed to learn from the Chaozhou-Shantou Special District in Guangdong and ensure that it becomes the first grain eight-hundred-jin special district in the province this year. The Jinjiang Special District has a large population and little land, and historically it has been the area with the greatest need for grain and the most grain shortages. After achieving the goal this year, it will be transformed from a grain-deficient area to a self-sufficient or surplus area, and two-thirds of the counties in the district will have a grain yield per mu of 800 jin or more.
　　The meeting emphasized that the key to building socialism in Fujian lies in developing the mountain economy. The policy for developing the mountain economy is to comprehensively develop forestry, animal husbandry, and native and special products, minerals, and other diversified economies, on the condition of doing a good job in soil and water conservation and giving priority to the development of grain and oil crops. The meeting pointed out that Fujian is basically a mountainous area and a "green treasure house." In recent years, the development and changes in the mountain economy have been great. As long as we show revolutionary spirit and work hard, the economic development of the mountain areas can surpass the coastal areas.

### 英雄气壮  河山易色  福建争取五年实现千斤省

　　英雄气壮  河山易色
    福建争取五年实现千斤省
    本报福州5日电　中共福建省第一届代表大会第二次会议提出了富于革命干劲和英雄气魄的四大口号：要达到思想大跃进、指标大跃进，同时也要达到措施大跃进、作风大跃进。会议提出了一项大跃进计划，在五年内实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的指标。
    会议要求：到1962年，全省粮食平均亩产量达到八百斤以上，争取实现“千斤省”，（现在不到四百八十斤）。1962年，全省地方工业产值达到三十亿元左右（目前仅有二亿一千万元），现代工业在工农业产值中的比重，由目前的17.2％增加到40％左右。此外，五年内全省要修建公路六千公里，山区大道一万公里，作到全省大的乡镇都通公路，大部分农业社都通大道；基本上消灭荒山，完成绿化；消灭“四害”，争取成为“四无省”；作到社社有小学，乡乡有完小，区区有初中，县县有完中，同时在全省青壮年中扫除文盲。一个几乎全境是山区、在经济上又比较落后的省份，经过五年苦战，达到彻底改变面貌。
    这次会议共开了五十八天，已于1月30日胜利闭幕。会议正确分析了当前的革命形势，严厉地批判了存在于党内的右倾保守思想。正如代表们说的，这是一个促进大会。
    会议认为，有一部分同志抱着差不多的指导思想来看待过去的工作、设想今后的事业。这种人的表现是，有了一点成绩便骄傲自满起来，不再想前进了，思想也凝固了，手脚也迟钝了，特别当猛干大干一阵以后，就想停顿一下，休息一下。他们的主要毛病是只向后看，不向前看，认为革命事业发展的规律不是跃进催跃进，而是跃进停顿再跃进。另有一部分同志在革命进程中摇摆不定，动荡不稳，当气候对他们有利、工作顺利的时候，便能使上劲；当遇到困难和矛盾的时候，便埋怨这个埋怨那个，这个也不对了那个也不对了。这种人的毛病在于只看消极的因素，无视积极的因素；夸大局部的不利的因素，缩小普遍的有利的因素。他们对党的号召是，今天思想通了，到明天又不通了，干劲像波浪一样起伏不定。还有一种同志对革命事业没有自觉感和责任感。会议严格批判了这些错误思想，提倡和发扬了不断革命的精神，反对了中庸之道，认为抱着中庸之道的人，看起来平平稳稳，实际上是革命朝气不足，发展下去不可避免地会有掉队的危险。会议批判了那种畏首畏尾向困难低头的人，认为迴避困难的人就在于不知道事物是在不断的矛盾中发展的，一个矛盾将导致另一个矛盾，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会产生，不断革命就是要不断解决摆在面前的矛盾，不断促进事物的发展，而只有始终保持革命朝气和革命干劲，才能适应革命形势发展的需要。
    为了提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要指标，会议要求今年粮食产量达到一百亿斤，比1957年增产14.2％，每亩平均产量达到五百斤以上。今年全省将出现粮食千斤县（市）十一个，粮食八百斤县（市）七个。龙溪专区提出了向广东潮（州）汕（头）专区看齐，保证今年成为全省第一个粮食八百斤专区。晋江专区人多土地少，历史上就是需粮最大缺粮最多的地区，今年实现目标以后，将由缺粮区变成自给区或余粮区，全区将有三分之二的县粮食亩产量达到八百斤或千斤以上。
    会议强调指出：福建建设社会主义的关键在于发展山区经济。开发山区经济的方针是，在做好水土保持、优先发展粮食和油料作物的条件下，全面发展林业牧业和土特产、矿产等多种经济。会议指出：福建基本上是山区，是一个“绿色金库”，几年来山区经济发展变化很大，只要拿出革命精神，鼓足劲来干，山区的经济的发展是能够超过沿海地区的。
