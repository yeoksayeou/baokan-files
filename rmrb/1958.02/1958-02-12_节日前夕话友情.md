Talking about Friendship on the Eve of the Festival
By our reporter Dai Feng

February 14th is the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This day has become a festival for the people of our two countries. On the eve of this festival, the reporter interviewed several Soviet friends who have worked in China. They talked about their impressions of China, remembered their Chinese friends, and cared about the construction of the Chinese people. They, like all Soviet people, love the Chinese people and sincerely support them. This kind of friendship has never existed in history...

In a simple office of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, I met Grigory Stepanenko, a Soviet expert who had worked in our country for three years. On the front of his dark brown suit, he conspicuously wore a commemorative badge of the five-star red flag given to him by a Chinese comrade.

"I lived in China for three years. To be honest, I think those three years passed too quickly," Stepanenko began kindly. "I think I can be regarded as a direct witness to the growing consolidation and development of Soviet-Chinese friendship. All Soviet people love the Chinese people, and I love them even more. China is simply my second motherland."

Stepanenko is an expert at the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture in charge of state farm management. At the invitation of the Chinese government in 1954, he served as a consultant in the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Land Reclamation. During his three years of working in China, he traveled all over Northeast and South China to help our country organize land planning and reclaim wasteland, and only returned to Moscow last year.

Speaking of China, his bright eyes sparkled with joy. He paused for a moment and then said:

"I should say that I am not unfamiliar with my second motherland. A long time ago, I remember when I was a member of the Communist Youth League, I cheered for the victory of your Red Army and for your establishment of the first Soviet regime. Of course, the temporary setbacks in your revolutionary cause also pained my heart."

"Going to work in liberated China, I think, is a task I should complete, and it is also my early wish. In particular, the work of establishing the state-owned 'Friendship' Farm, in which I participated, is the greatest happiness of my life. This farm is truly the crystallization of our friendship!"

Due to his modesty, he only briefly talked about his work at the "Friendship" Farm. In fact, Stepanenko and the Soviet experts he led did a great deal of work. They not only completed the land planning of the "Friendship" Farm and established scientific land planning and wasteland surveying work for our country, but also cultivated a group of farm management cadres for our country.

Stepanenko continued: "The diligence and modesty of the Chinese comrades made the work achieve amazing results. This has been deeply educating me. I have traveled almost all over China, and everywhere is a high tide of building socialism. This huge and amazing leap forward power has broken conventions, overcome difficulties, and achieved victory. I believe, I should say I firmly believe, that if our two brotherly countries advance hand in hand, victory will surely belong to us."

I asked him what he would like to say to his old Chinese friends during this festival. He said: "There is too much I want to say. I think the 'Friendship' Farm must have made greater progress this year. The workers of Chinese state-owned farms must also pay more attention to the multi-faceted development of the farm, and pay more attention to animal husbandry. I often receive letters from Chinese comrades. If I were to make a criticism, those letters are all written too politely. In the future, I hope everyone will communicate often and talk more about problems. You must know that my heart has never left you. Your cause is my cause, and your difficulties are also my difficulties..."

I also visited another Soviet expert who had just returned from China. This Soviet expert is closely related to China's ability to produce color films such as "New Year Sacrifice" and "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" in just a few years. This expert is Grigory Liepin. He is tall and often bursts into hearty, enthusiastic laughter when talking to me. He is the chief engineer of the Moscow Gorky Film Studio and served as a consultant in the Film Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Culture. He helped solve many major problems in the construction of China's film industry, one of which was helping to build color film studios in Beijing, Shanghai and other places.

"I remember there is a very good saying in your Chinese language, 'Every festival makes one think of relatives'," Liepin said with a hearty laugh, "That's how I feel now!"

"We have only signed the alliance treaty for eight years, but our consolidated friendship will last forever. The Chinese people have made great achievements in all aspects in the past eight years. I don't want to say anything else, just look at the achievements you have made in the film industry in the short eight years. For someone like me who has been engaged in the film industry for more than 30 years, I am also deeply amazed. The quality of your recently produced color films and widescreen films is very good. Especially for people like me who understand the state of the Chinese film industry before liberation, one cannot help but feel infinite joy for your achievements. It is because of the care of your party and government for the film industry that you have achieved such great achievements."

Afterwards, he talked about his old friends.

"I often work with engineers from Shanghai, Beijing, and Changchun film studios. The Chinese comrades' hard work and modesty made a deep impression on me."

He put a large pile of letters in front of me, about twenty letters. These are recently from China. Some of these letters are written in Chinese, and some are written in Chinese mixed with Russian. These letters contain greetings, talks about their own work, and requests for solutions to work difficulties.

Liepin pointed to the letter and said with a smile: "Now you can see that I have never thought that I have left the Chinese film industry and left my Chinese friends!"

The Gorky Film Studio has close ties with the Chinese film industry. All Chinese films screened in the Soviet Union are dubbed and copied by the Gorky Film Studio. Last year, "New Year Sacrifice", which was dubbed and copied by the factory, was well received by the audience. The "Family", copied by the factory, has met with Soviet audiences. Soon, they will start dubbing and copying films such as "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" and "Song Jingshi".

When I said goodbye to him, he shook hands with me enthusiastically and said earnestly: "Please send my greetings to the Chinese filmmakers. I hope you don't write about the work I did in China, I didn't actually do anything. Just write 'I love China'."

The third person I visited was a Soviet Honored Artist who had just returned from China. Thousands of Chinese artists and university students have listened to his courses on "Art Theory" and "History of Russian Soviet Art". His name is Alexander Semoshkin, and he is currently the curator of the Pushkin Museum of Art in Moscow.

Shortly after returning to China, Semoshkin wrote a "Chinese Impression" and gave a special report on China on Moscow Radio.

"To calculate the time, I only stayed in China for a year," Semoshkin calmly said. "To talk about feelings, I can't finish talking about it in a few days and nights. During this year, I never felt that I was living in a foreign country. Artists are good at using the most beautiful words to describe moving feelings. But when I think back to everything in China, I cannot use words. I can only say that I have a deep love for China in my heart. I love the thriving new life, and even more the simple and hardworking builders of the new life."

"Coming back from China, I feel that my horizons have been broadened. China's long and splendid culture has given me a deep impression. For example, let's talk about your traditional Chinese painting, I like it very much. I especially like traditional Chinese paintings that reflect the new life of modern China."

Talking about strengthening contacts in the future, Semoshkin said: "After I arrived in China, I deeply felt that we must further strengthen contacts, understand each other and learn from each other. Last year, we held an exhibition of Chinese traditional Chinese paintings in our museum, which not only aroused great interest among the broad masses of people, but also benefited our painters a lot."

"The mutual love and mutual learning between the people of our two countries is strength. I am willing to dedicate everything to strengthen this kind of strength," Semoshkin concluded.

    节日前夕话友情
    本报记者　戴枫
    2月14日是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订八周年纪念日。这一天已成为我们两国人民的节日了。在这个节日前夕，记者访问了几位在中国工作过的苏联朋友。他们谈起了对中国的印象，念念不忘他们的中国朋友，关怀中国人民的建设。他们同所有苏联人民一样热爱着中国人民，热诚地支持中国人民。这种友情在历史上是从未有过的……
    在苏联农业部一间简朴的办公室里，我会见了在我国工作过三年的苏联专家葛利高里·司契潘尼科。他那深褐色的西服前襟上，醒目地别着一个中国同志送给他的五星红旗的纪念章。
    “我在中国住了三年，说真的，我觉得那三年实在过得太快了。”司契潘尼科亲切地开始说：“我想，我可以算是苏中两国巩固友谊日益发展的一个直接见证人。所有的苏联人都热爱中国人，我呢，更爱。中国简直是我的第二祖国。”
    司契潘尼科是苏联农业部负责国营农场管理工作的专家。1954年应中国政府的邀请，先后曾在中国农业部和农垦部担任顾问。他在中国工作的三年里，为了帮助我国组织土地规划，开垦荒地，曾走遍了我国东北、华南各地，去年才回到了莫斯科。
    提起中国，他那明亮的眼睛闪耀着喜悦的光辉。他沉默了一下接着说：
    “应该说，我对第二祖国并不是陌生的。很早之前，记得我还是共青团员的时候，我就为你们红军的胜利，为你们建立起第一个苏维埃政权而欢呼。当然，你们革命事业的暂时挫折，也曾绞痛过我的心。”
    “到解放了的中国去工作，我认为是我应该完成的任务，也是我早期的愿望。特别是我所参加的建立国营‘友谊’农场的工作，是我一生中最大的幸福。这个农场真正是我们友谊的结晶啊！”
    由于自谦，他只轻描淡写地谈了些他在“友谊”农场的工作。实际上，司契潘尼科和他所领导的苏联专家们作了巨大的工作。他们不仅完成了“友谊”农场的土地规划，为我国建立了科学的土地规划和荒地勘测工作，并为我国培养了一批农场管理干部。
    司契潘尼科接着说：“中国同志的勤劳、谦虚，使工作取得了惊人的成就。这一点一直深深地教育着我。我差不多走遍了全中国，到处是一片建设社会主义的高潮。这种巨大惊人的跃进力量，打破了成规，克服了困难，取得了胜利。我相信，应该说我坚信，咱们两国兄弟手携手前进，胜利一定属于我们。”
    我问他在这节日里想对中国老朋友说些什么。他说：“想说的太多了。我想，‘友谊’农场这一年一定有了更大的发展。中国国营农场的工作者一定也更加注意农场的多方面的发展了，对畜牧业也更加注意了。我经常收到中国同志来信，如果说句批评的话，那些信都写得太客气了，今后希望大家经常通信，多谈些问题。要知道，我的心一点也没有离开你们。你们的事业，就是我的事业，你们的困难，也就是我的困难……”
    我还访问了另一位刚从中国回来的苏联专家。这位苏联专家与中国在短短几年内能拍制像“祝福”、“女篮五号”这样的彩色影片有密切关系。这位专家是葛利高里·列宾。他高高的身材，同我谈话时常常发出爽朗的热情的笑声。他是莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂的总工程师，曾在中国文化部电影局担任顾问。他帮助解决了许多中国电影事业建设上的重大问题，其中之一就是在北京、上海等地帮助建起了彩色电影摄制厂。
    “我记得你们中国有一句很好的俗语‘每逢佳节倍思亲’”，列宾笑声朗朗地说：“现在，我就是这种心情啊！”
    “我们签订同盟条约才八年，但我们巩固的友谊是永世长存的。中国人民在最近八年内各方面都取得了巨大成就，别的我不想说，只看你们短短八年来在电影事业上取得的成就吧。对我这从事于电影事业三十多年的人，也是深感惊奇的。最近你们出品的彩色片、宽银幕影片，质量都非常好。尤其像我这样了解中国解放前的电影事业状况的人，就更不能不为你们这种成就而感到无限高兴。有你们的党和政府对电影事业的关心，所以才取得了这样大的成就啊。”
    随后，他谈起自己的老朋友们。
    “我同上海、北京、长春电影制片厂的工程师们常在一起工作。中国同志工作坚苦努力，待人谦虚，给了我深刻的印象。”
    他放在我面前一大堆信件，有二十来封。这是最近从中国来的。这些信有的是用中文写的，有的是用中文夹杂着俄文写的。这些信有问候的，有谈自己工作的，有请求解决工作困难的。
    列宾指着信笑着说：“现在你可以看得出来，我从来没有认为，我是离开了中国电影事业，离开了中国朋友！”
    高尔基电影制片厂与中国电影界有着紧密的联系。在苏联放映的所有中国影片都是由高尔基电影制片厂配音复制的。去年，这个厂配音复制的“祝福”，受到了观众们一致好评。该厂复制的“家”，已同苏联观众见面了。不久将着手配音复制“女篮五号”和“宋景诗”等等影片。
    当我向他告别时，他一面热情地同我握手，一面恳切地说：“代我向中国电影工作者问候。关于我在中国作的工作，希望你不要写，我事实上没有做什么。你只写‘我爱中国’就行了。”
    我所拜访的第三个人是一位苏联功勋艺术家，他刚从中国回来。成千的中国艺术家、大学生听过他的“艺术理论”、“俄罗斯苏维埃艺术史”课。他叫亚历山大·谢莫希金，现任莫斯科普希金艺术博物馆馆长。
    谢莫希金回国后不久就写了一本“中国印象记”，在莫斯科广播电台做过关于中国的专题报告。
    “要算时间，我在中国只停留了一年，”谢莫希金从容不迫地谈起来：“要说感受，是几天几夜也谈不完的。这一年多里，我从来没有感到过我是生活在外国。艺术家们都擅长运用最美好的词汇来描绘动人心弦的感受。但是在回想到中国的一切时，我却无法运用词汇。我只能说，我内心蕴藏着对中国的深爱。我爱蒸蒸日上的新生活，更爱那俭朴勤劳的新生活建设者。”
    “从中国回来，我感到自己的眼界扩大了。中国悠久灿烂的文化给了我很深的印象。譬如，就说你们的国画吧，我非常喜爱它。我更喜欢反映现代新中国新生活的国画。”
    谈到今后加强联系时，谢莫希金说：“从我到了中国之后，我深切感到我们必须更进一步加强联系，相互了解、相互学习。去年在我们馆里举行了中国国画展览，不仅引起了广大人民的极大兴趣，而且，对我们画家们说来，也得益不浅。”
    “我们两国人民间相互的热爱、相互的学习，这就是力量。我愿为加强这种力量而献出一切。”谢莫希金结束时说。
