Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: The Indonesian Ministry of Information, in a radio broadcast statement on the evening of February 25th, reiterated that Indonesia, as an independent nation, has full power to determine the extent of its territorial waters.

The Ministry of Information pointed out that the Indonesian government's new decision on the issue of territorial waters is based on Indonesia's national interests, while past decisions were made by Dutch colonialists according to their own interests.

Prior to this, on December 13, 1957, the Indonesian government decided that the seas surrounding the Indonesian islands, between the islands, and connecting the islands are Indonesian territorial waters, and the territorial waters between Indonesia and foreign countries are extended from three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles. Subsequently, countries such as the United States, Britain, and Japan expressed opposition.

The Ministry of Information pointed out that it is necessary to protect the waterways and territorial waters between the Indonesian islands, which are Indonesia's abundant resources and the source of livelihood for the Indonesian people.

The Ministry of Information also pointed out that the continuous activities of Dutch warships in Indonesian territorial waters are in violation of the Indonesian government's decisions and endanger the security of the Indonesian nation and people.

According to Antara News Agency, the Naval Information Office announced on February 25 that the Dutch submarine "Drenthe" intercepted the ship "Gadjah Barong," which had been taken over by the Indonesian government from the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd, in the Makassar Strait on the 20th, and seized the weapons of fourteen Indonesian army personnel on board, and towed the "Gadjah Barong" to West Irian.

    印度尼西亚政府维护国家利益
    坚持有权决定本国领海范围
    新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚情报部25日晚间在电台广播的声明中再一次指出，印度尼西亚作为一个独立国家有充分权力来决定本国领海的范围。
    情报部指出，印度尼西亚政府作出的关于领海问题的新决定是从印度尼西亚的国家利益出发的，而过去的决定是荷兰殖民主义者根据它自己的利益作出的。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚政府在1957年12月13日决定，围绕印度尼西亚各岛屿的、在各岛屿之间和联接各岛屿的海面是印度尼西亚的领海，印度尼西亚同外国之间的领海从三海里扩展为十二海里。其后，美、英、日等国家表示反对。
    情报部指出，必须保护印度尼西亚各岛屿之间的水路和领海，这是印度尼西亚的丰富资源，也是印度尼西亚人民赖以生活的泉源。
    情报部还指出，目前荷兰军舰不断在印度尼西亚领海活动，这是违反印度尼西亚政府的决定的，而且也危害了印度尼西亚国家和人民的安全。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，海军新闻处在25日宣布，荷兰潜水艇“德伦特号”20日在望加锡海峡拦劫了已经被印度尼西亚政府接管的荷兰皇家轮船公司的船只“加兴巴号”，并且夺取了船上的十四名印度尼西亚陆军人员的武器，还把“加兴巴号”拖到西伊里安去。
