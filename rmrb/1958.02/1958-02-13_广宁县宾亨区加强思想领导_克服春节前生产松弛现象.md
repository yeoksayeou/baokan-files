    Binheng District, Guangning County, Strengthens Ideological Leadership
    Overcome Pre-Spring Festival Production Slacking

    (Our dispatch) Some agricultural cooperative members in Binheng District, Guangning County, Guangdong, after completing the first phase of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, were busy finding money for the New Year, resulting in a period of production slacking.

    Some members of the 87 cooperatives in the district believed that since the Spring Festival was approaching, they should concentrate on developing side occupations that could generate cash income, so they could eat and drink well and have a "comfortable New Year."

    District and township cadres immediately launched a discussion of this issue throughout the district, making many cooperative members realize that spending less money for the New Year was not a big deal, but failure to complete the winter production plan would jeopardize this year's increased production. The vast majority of cooperatives also changed their plans to prioritize side occupations over agriculture and pursue more money for the New Year.

    The Nan Village Cooperative of Binheng Township had a large water conservancy task in the previous period and few avenues for side occupations, earning only eight yuan a day, which was not enough for the cooperative members to buy oil and salt, resulting in lackluster attendance. The leadership then proactively helped them find avenues for side occupations, so that each household could receive more than ten yuan before the New Year. As a result, many cooperative members enthusiastically engaged in fertilizer accumulation and soil improvement work.

    Some cooperatives, such as the Dacheng Cooperative and Jinji Cooperative in Dalian Township, were fully capable of resolving their Spring Festival expenses, but the members were unsure and blindly complained about not having money for the New Year. After assessing their assets and calculating their income, the members of these cooperatives also settled down.

    广宁县宾亨区加强思想领导
    克服春节前生产松弛现象
    本报讯　广东广宁县宾亨区的一些农业社社员，在完成第一期中小型水利计划后，便忙于找钱过年，因此，一度发生了生产松弛现象。
    这个区八十七个社中有一些社员认为春节将到，要集中力量多搞有现款收入的副业，好在春节期间吃个痛快，过个“舒服年”。
    区乡干部立即将这个问题在全区展开讨论，使许多社员认识到过年少用点钱不要紧，冬季生产计划不完成今年增产就没有保证。绝大部分社也都改变了重副业、轻农业，追求过年多分钱的打算。
    宾亨乡南村社前段水利任务大，副业门路不多，一天收入只得八元，不够社员买油盐，社员出勤冷冷落落。领导上便主动帮助他们找副业门路，到过年每户可分十多元，因此，许多社员又热烈投入了积肥改良土壤工作。
    也有一些社如大良乡大诚社、金鸡社春节用款是完全能够解决的，但社员心中无底，也盲目叫喊无钱过年。这些社经过摸家底，核算收入后，社员们也都安下心来。
