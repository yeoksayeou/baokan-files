    At Minus Thirty Degrees
    By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong
    The dead of winter envelops Fulaerji, the rising town on the Heilongjiang grasslands. On the construction site of the Fulaerji Heavy Machinery Plant – hailed as a red star on the grasslands – ice and snow are everywhere, and the biting Mongolian wind whips up swirling blizzards. The temperature here often drops to minus thirty degrees Celsius, sometimes even minus forty.
    One might well ask: how can construction possibly continue in such frigid weather? Yet, on this construction site spanning over ten square kilometers, a construction army of more than ten thousand people, having conquered the threat of severe cold, is laboring intensely day and night.
    In an office building next to the construction site, I found Deputy Manager Chen Dianyuan, one of the leaders of the Construction Engineering Department's directly subordinate engineering company responsible for this project. This deputy manager, who was a division commander in the People's Liberation Army just three years ago, still spends most of his time on the construction site, personally directing the work and resolving difficulties, just like a commander on the battlefield. Finding him in the office this time was indeed fortunate.
    Deputy Manager Chen Dianyuan began to tell me about the winter construction situation. He said, "In terms of workload, this winter's construction tasks are more than twice that of the same period last year, and equivalent to one-third of this year's total tasks. Because of the heavy workload, cold weather, and complex and difficult construction techniques, we put forward the slogan: 'Make the cold bow its head, make difficulties give way!' Now, all projects are overfulfilling their quotas." This shows that our workers are capable of withstanding the test of cold.
    Then, Comrade Chen Dianyuan added, "When the Party Central Committee issued the great call for our country to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years, the builders of the Fulaerji Heavy Machinery Plant enthusiastically responded. They understand that the speed of the plant's completion is directly related to whether steel enterprises like Wuhan and Baotou can be put into production sooner, and directly related to whether we can catch up with or surpass Britain's steel production within fifteen years. When the workers link their work to these goals, they proactively propose the fighting goal of completing the construction half a year or a year ahead of schedule.
    Speaking of this, Deputy Manager Chen wanted me to go to the construction site to see the workers' enthusiasm. He said, "Seeing is believing. The workers' actual actions can answer everything you want to know."

    At the Piling Site
    Following the roar of the pile drivers, I walked towards the piling site. More than ten thousand piles need to be driven here as a foundation, and only after these piles are driven can the concrete foundations above ground be poured, the steel beams and columns erected, and the roofs and brick walls built. Therefore, the workers call it a key project. I thought of the scene when I came here a few months ago: at that time, due to the complex geological conditions, a pile that was originally planned to be driven in a few hours took two or three days to drive in; some piles could not be driven in at all. Now, the workers have adopted the "soil disposal" and "water flushing" piling methods proposed by Soviet experts, and the piling project is proceeding smoothly. The workers have put forward the slogan "Time is wealth, the piling project is the overall progress of the project." No matter how cold the weather is, the pile drivers standing in the open field are constantly hammering the piles, and one pile after another is being sent underground. They are not made of steel, but they are not afraid of the cold even more than steel. In the coldest times, the pile drivers cannot be stopped, because if they are stopped, the engine and cylinders will freeze and break. The pile drivers are operating day and night without end, and the piling workers are guarding the pile drivers day and night. The heroic piling workers are working so hard, determined to complete the pile foundation project five months ahead of schedule.

    The Arduous "Caisson" Project
    The workers also introduced to me the recently completed "caisson" project. This is a major part of the heavy machinery plant's rough heat treatment workshop, which will house three huge quenching furnaces for quenching giant parts weighing hundreds of tons for the entire plant. This project is equivalent to building a multi-story building underground. Not only has it never been done in China's construction history, but it is also rare in the world. Workers have to endure two and a half to three "atmospheres" of pressure in the closed, dark, and airtight caisson to excavate soil. They have to endure the foggy oil and carbon fumes; they have to constantly fight against the mud that rises from underground; when digging the cutting edge at the bottom of the caisson, they have to crawl in the mud because of the narrow working surface. The workers working in the "caisson" overcame all kinds of difficulties with their amazing perseverance, created many glorious achievements in the construction, and ensured that the "caisson" project was completed half a year ahead of schedule with good quality.

    The Prototype of Several New Factory Buildings
    On the construction site, the most eye-catching thing is the forest of steel standing high in the sky in the southwest corner of the factory, where the hoisting workers are lifting various metal components from the ground to the sky. At night, the lights here are as bright as day, and locomotives pull trains in and out, unloading the metal components onto the ground. At dawn, the construction site begins to boil. Various lifting machines roar into the construction site, and the workers responsible for assembling and welding the components in the air also climb to the high altitude of the steel forest. The "steel giant" weighing forty tons and standing seventy meters tall also begins to get busy. Moving back and forth on the steel track, waving its steel giant arm, extending and contracting to lift various types of metal components into the air and placing them on the factory frame. Now, the component hoisting work of the entire factory's largest steel casting and hydraulic press workshop is about to end, and the component hoisting work of four workshops including large-scale metal processing and rough heat treatment has also begun. Steel columns stand tall like forests, and several prototypes of new factory buildings have been erected on the construction site.

    Enthusiasm Overwhelmed the Cold
    The workers hoisting and welding at a height of thirty or forty meters in the air must be much colder than the people on the ground! They are touching cold steel, and the sharp and piercing cold wind is blowing in their faces. Although the administration has stipulated a system of workers taking turns to rest on the ground, no one is willing to come down to rest until it is time to get off work. Why? According to them, "Our labor enthusiasm has overwhelmed the cold in North Manchuria, and everyone doesn't feel cold." Saying they don't feel cold is not necessarily true, but saying their labor enthusiasm is high is definitely true. Hoisting worker Zhou Shilun is a southerner who had hardly ever seen snow before; but on the snowy Heilongjiang grassland, he withstood the test of the cold. One day, just as a Siberian cold wave was hitting, Zhou Shilun climbed to the top of a steel column in the open air. At some point, one of his gloves was torn by the steel wire rope, and the exposed skin immediately froze to the steel, tearing off a layer of skin. At first, blood flowed straight down, and then even the blood froze. Zhou Shilun endured the pain and continued to climb back and forth on the steel beam frame. With the movement of the lifting machinery, he straightened and assembled the components on this side for a while, and then riveted the steel beam joints on that side. He was so busy that he hardly had a minute to rest. After working continuously in the air for half a day, his fingers were so swollen and thick that he couldn't even take off his gloves when he came down, but he climbed to the high altitude to work again the next day. Under his leadership, their team overfulfilled the plan month after month.
    The cold climate in North Manchuria also makes the underground soil freeze hard and thick. No matter how powerful the excavators and bulldozers are, they can't pry open a piece of it. The workers drove dense iron drills into the ground, wired them with electric wires, and turned on the current. The heat of the electricity was like a red-hot iron block inserted straight into the heart of the earth, and the heat flow diffused and radiated in all directions. After a day, the hard soil was heated and loosened. At this time, the excavators and bulldozers began to dig the soil.
    Under the hands of the heroic construction workers, the Fulaerji Heavy Machinery Plant is changing day by day. It is hard to believe that in just over a year, the blueprints of the architects have become a reality, and the prototype of a majestic heavy machinery plant has clearly appeared before people's eyes.

    在零下三十度
    本报记者　康伟中
    隆冬笼罩着黑龙江草原上的新兴城镇——富拉尔基。在被人们誉为草原上的一颗红星——富拉尔基重型机器厂——的工地上，到处冰天雪地，刺骨的蒙古风卷起了万丈风雪。这里的气候经常是零下三十度，有时降到零下四十度。
    人们一定会想到：这样的大冷天，怎么还能施工呢？然而在这方圆足有十多公里的建设工地上，一支万余人组成的建设大军战胜了严寒的威胁，正在日日夜夜紧张地劳动着。
    在建设工地旁边一座办公大楼上，记者找到了陈佃园副经理，他是负责这项工程的建筑工程部直属工程公司的领导者之一。这位副经理三年前还是人民解放军的师长，现在，他仍像驰骋在战场上的指挥官一样，把绝大部分时间深入到工地，亲自指挥施工，解决工作中的困难。这次我能在办公室里找到他，确是件幸运的事。
    陈佃园副经理开始向我谈到冬季施工的情况。他说：“按工作量来说，今年冬季施工的任务，相当于去年同期任务的两倍多，相当于今年任务的三分之一。因为任务多、天气冷、施工技术又复杂困难，我们提出了：‘让寒冷低头，让困难让路’的口号。现在各项工程都能超额完成。”这说明我们的工人是能够经得起寒冷的考验的。
    接着，陈佃园同志又说：“当党中央提出我国在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面要在十五年内赶上或超过英国的伟大号召后，富拉尔基重型机器厂的建设者们，就热烈地响应了这个号召。他们懂得这个厂建成的快和慢，直接关系到武汉、包头等钢铁企业能否早日投入生产，直接关系到十五年能否赶上或超过英国的钢产量。当工人们把自己的工作同这些联系起来的时候，他们便主动提出提前半年或一年建成的奋斗目标。
    谈到这里，陈副经理要我到工地上去看看工人的干劲。他说：“百闻不如一见，工人的实际行动，可以解答你所要知道的一切。”
    在打桩工地上
    随着打桩机的轰鸣声，我向打桩工地走去。这里要打进一万多根作为基础的桩子，这些桩子打下去，地面上的混凝土基础才能浇灌，钢梁柱子才能立起来，屋面、砖墙才可以修建，因而工人们把他叫做关键工程。我想到了几个月前我来这里的情景：当时因为地质情况复杂，本来计划几小时就能打进一根桩子的，结果两、三天才能打进；有的桩子根本打不下去。现在，工人们采用了苏联专家提出的“弃土”、“水冲”打桩法，打桩工程顺利地进行着。工人们提出了“时间就是财富、打桩工程就是工程总进度”的口号，不管气候多么寒冷，矗立在旷野上的打桩机不停地锤着桩子，一根根桩子被送入地下。他们不是钢铁打出来的，但是他们却比钢铁还不怕冷。在最冷的时候，打桩机也不能停开，因为停开了，发动机和气缸就会冻坏。打桩机日夜无休止地开动着，打桩工人也就夜以继日地守在打桩机旁。英雄的打桩工人就是这样顽强地劳动着，决心要提前五个月完成桩基工程。
    艰苦的“沉箱”工程
    工人们还向我介绍了这里最近完工的“沉箱”工程。这是重型机器厂粗加热处理车间的一个主要部分，里面将设三个巨大的淬火炉，为全厂上百吨的巨型部件进行淬火。这个工程等于在地下兴建一座几层高的楼房。不仅在我国建筑史上从未有过，就是在世界上也为数不多。工人们要在封闭着的不见天不透风的沉箱里，抗住两个半到三个的“大气压”来进行挖土。要忍受雾气腾腾的油、炭味；要不时地和从地下泛上的泥浆作斗争；挖沉箱下部的刃角时，因工作面窄小，要在泥浆中爬行干活。工作在“沉箱”里的工人们，以他们惊人的毅力克服了种种困难，在施工中创造了不少光辉的事绩，保证了“沉箱”工程在质量良好的基础上提前半年完成了任务。
    几个新厂房的雏型
    在建筑工地上，最惹人注目的是矗立在厂西南角高空那一片钢铁丛林，在那里，吊装工人正把各种金属构件由地面吊向空中。入夜，这里灯光如昼，火车头牵引着列车驶进驶出，把满载的金属构件卸到地上。黎明，工地上就开始沸腾起来了。各种起重机械吼叫着驶进了工地，负责在空中装配和焊接构件的工人也爬上了钢铁丛林的高空。那个起重四十吨、身高七十公尺的“钢铁巨人”也开始忙碌起来了。在钢轨道上来回移动，挥舞着钢铁巨臂，一伸一缩地把各种类型的金属构件吊向空中，安放在厂房架上。现在，全厂最大的铸钢、水压机车间厂房的构件吊装工作即将结束，大型金工、粗加热处理等四个车间的构件吊装工作也已经开始，钢柱耸立如林，在工地上已经矗立起了几个新厂房的雏型。
    热情压服了寒冷
    在三、四十公尺高空吊装和焊接的工人们，他们不知比地面上的人要冷多少倍！他们手摸的是冰冷的钢铁，迎面袭来的是尖厉刺骨的冷风。虽然行政上曾规定工人轮流下地休息的制度，可是不到下班时间谁也不肯下来休息。为什么呢？按照他们的话说是：“我们的劳动热情已经压服住了北满地区的寒冷，大家不觉得有什么冷。”说不觉得冷不见得是实话，说劳动热情高这倒是千真万确的。吊装工人周仕伦是个南方人，过去几乎连雪都没有见过；可是在冰天雪地的黑龙江草原上，他却经受住了寒冷的考验。有一天，正当西伯利亚寒流袭来的时候，周仕伦却向无遮无拦的高空钢柱顶端爬去。不知什么时候他的一只手套被钢丝绳刮破了，露出的皮肤立刻和钢铁冻结在一起，扯下了一层皮。最初鲜血直流，后来连血也冻结了。周仕伦忍受着疼痛，继续在钢梁架上爬来爬去，随着起重机械的移动，他一会儿在这边把构件摆正装配好，一会儿又在那边把钢梁衔接处用铆钉钉上。他忙得几乎连一分钟休息的时间都没有。他在高空连续工作半天后，手指头冻肿得那样粗，下来时连手套都脱不下来了，可是第二天他又爬到高空工作了。在他的带动下，他们的小队月月超额完成计划。
    北满寒冷的气候也使地下的土层冻得又硬又厚，任凭挖土机和推土机有多么大的威力，也别想撬开它一块。工人们在地上打下了密密麻麻的铁钎子，在上面网上电线，通上电流，那电的热力就像烧红的铁块子一样直插入土地的腹心，热流向四面扩散幅射，经过一天的时间，这坚硬的土地就热气腾腾地被化开和松动了。这时候挖土机和推土机才开始挖土。
    富拉尔基重型机器厂在英雄的建筑工人的手下，正日新月异地在发生着变化。真叫人难以相信，仅仅在一年多的时间内，建筑师笔下的蓝图已经成为现实，一座巍峨的重型机器厂雏形已清晰地呈现在人们眼前。（附图片）
