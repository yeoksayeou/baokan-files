(Special dispatch from Harbin by our newspaper and Xinhua News Agency) The winter upsurge of water conservancy construction in Heilongjiang Province has continued for nearly four months. The momentum of the movement is growing stronger. Now is the coldest time of the year here, with the lowest temperature reaching minus thirty-five degrees Celsius. In the field, a drop of hot sweat from the face to the ground will immediately freeze into ice. But on the silver plain, which is covered with ice for thousands of miles, there are red flags fluttering during the day and red lights shining at night. The number of people participating in water conservancy construction in the province has increased from 180,000 to 270,000. Fifty to seventy percent of the water conservancy project plans have now been completed in five-fourths of the province's counties.

Heilongjiang Province is located four thousand miles north of the Yellow River. The whole province is striving to achieve the target of 400 jin per mu as stipulated in the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program within five years. The construction of water conservancy projects is one of the main measures to increase production and achieve this leap forward. The six-foot-thick frozen soil only leaves a white mark when struck with a pickaxe. The weight of the pickaxes used in Shuangcheng County has increased from the usual seven to ten jin to ten to twelve jin. After the frozen soil layer is broken, the soft soil will re-freeze overnight after work. Wuchang County, which decided to achieve the target of 400 jin of grain per mu this year, has created eight methods to overcome the frozen soil layer, one of which is to work in three shifts, day and night, after breaking the frozen soil layer, so that the soft soil has no chance to freeze.

Under these difficult conditions, an average laborer can only complete about one cubic meter of earthwork per day. But the perseverance and determination of the farmers to build water conservancy projects make all difficulties seem insignificant. The "water conservancy construction competition" carried out in the mountainous Shangzhi County is the main content of the winter production competition in each township and each cooperative in the county. The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jixian County has 2,175 mu of land that suffers from major floods and major disasters, minor floods and minor disasters, and reduced production even without floods. They decided to start this year to cut down ridges and fill in pits to eliminate waterlogging. In a strong wind a few days ago, the snow was swept into the air, and the sky and the ground were filled with snow mist, making it impossible for people to open their eyes. However, the members of the Pioneer Cooperative still worked in the wind and snow all day.

Farmers in Heilongjiang Province have also created many experiences in winter water conservancy construction. Large frozen soil blocks cannot be used to build projects, so they are broken into small pieces to be used as filling, and the gaps between the small pieces are filled with soft soil. After opening the frozen soil layer, instead of just digging soft soil downwards, they also hollow out the surrounding area from the soft soil layer like coal mining, and then open the hollowed-out frozen soil, which increases work efficiency by 60%.

### 黑龙江农民冒严寒修水利  争取在五年内粮食生产达到纲要指标

    黑龙江农民冒严寒修水利
    争取在五年内粮食生产达到纲要指标
    本报特约新华社哈尔滨专讯　黑龙江省掀起的冬季兴修水利热潮，已经持续了近四个月。运动的声势越来越大。现在这里已经是全年最冷的时候，最低温度达到零下三十五度。在野外，一滴热汗从脸上掉到地下，马上就会凝结成冰。但在千里冰封的银色原野上，白天是红旗飘飘，夜晚是红灯照耀。全省参加兴修水利的人数从十八万人增加到二十七万人。占全省五分之四的县，现在已经完成水利工程计划50％—70％。
    黑龙江省在黄河以北四千里之外。全省争取在五年内提前实现农业发展纲要四十条所规定的亩产四百斤的指标。兴修水利工程，是实现这种跃进的主要增产措施之一。六尺厚的冻土，洋镐打上去只起一个白痕。双城县使用的洋镐，已经由通常用的七斤到十斤增加到十斤到十二斤。打开冻土层，软土在收工后一夜之间又会重新冻住。决定今年就实现亩产四百斤粮食指标的五常县，创造了八种战胜冻土层的办法，其中有一种是打开冻土层后，三班轮流、昼夜不停的工作，让软土没有机会冻住。
    在这种困难的条件下，一个劳动力一天平均只能完成一个土方左右。但是农民兴修水利的毅力和决心使一切困难都显得微不足道。多山的尚志县开展的“比修水利”，就是这个县每个乡、每个社冬季生产竞赛的主要内容。集贤县先锋农业生产合作社有二千一百七十五亩地是大涝大灾、小涝小灾、不涝也减产。他们决定从今年开始，削岗填坑，消灭内涝。在几天前的一次大风中，积雪被卷到空中，满天满地一片雪雾，风刮的人睁不开眼睛。但是先锋社的社员，仍然在风雪中干了一天。
    黑龙江省的农民，在冬季兴修水利工程中，也创造了许许多多的经验。大的冻土块不能筑工程，就把它打成小块做填方，小块之间的空隙，填上软土。打开冻土层后，不光向下挖软土，还像采煤那样，从软土层向周围掏洞取土，而后再把挖空的冻土打开，这就使工作效率提高了60％。
