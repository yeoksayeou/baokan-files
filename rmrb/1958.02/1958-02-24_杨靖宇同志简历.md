    Comrade Yang Jingyu, originally named Ma Shangde, was from Queshan County, Henan Province. In 1923, he was admitted to Henan Provincial Kaifeng Industrial School. Later, he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League. In 1926, under the Party's instructions, he left the industrial school and went to Queshan, Xinyang, and other places to organize the peasant movement, becoming one of the leaders of the Nanzhao Peasant Uprising in Queshan, Henan on April 5, 1927. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in May of the same year. After the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Yang Jingyu went to the White areas of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other places to do Party work. Later, he was sent to Northeast China by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He was arrested five times in Kaifeng, Luoyang, Shenyang, Fushun, and other places. Because of his firm stance as a Communist Party member, he waged a tenacious struggle against the reactionary rulers and safeguarded the secrets of underground work.
      After the "September 18th Incident," Comrade Yang Jingyu was released from prison. Soon after, he was sent to Harbin by the Manchurian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, where he served as the Chairman of the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Secretary of the Party District Committee. He worked hard in factories, railways, schools, social organizations, and suburban rural areas, mobilizing the masses, organizing anti-Japanese associations, supporting the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, and mobilizing workers, peasants, youths, and students to join the army to resist Japan.
    In the spring of 1932, Comrade Yang Jingyu served as the Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. In the early summer of the same year, he also served as the Secretary of the Military Commission of the Manchurian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. In the autumn of that year, he went to Southern Manchuria on behalf of the Provincial Committee to inspect and reorganize the local Party organizations and guerrilla units and anti-Japanese associations along the Shenyang-Jilin Railway.
    In early 1933, Comrade Yang Jingyu served as the political commissar of the Panshi Guerrilla Force (South Manchurian Guerrilla Force of the 32nd Army of the Chinese Red Army). He launched a powerful anti-Japanese guerrilla war in Yongji, Yitong, Shuangyang, Panshi, Dongfeng, Xifeng, Huadian, Huinan, Tonghua, and other places, becoming the core force of the anti-Japanese armed forces in Southern Manchuria. Since then, the relationship between the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in the vast areas of Southern Manchuria has become closer, the unity of the Chinese and Korean nationalities has been increasingly consolidated, and the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement of the broad masses has been increasingly surging.
    On September 18, 1933, the First Independent Division of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army was declared established in Panshi, and Comrade Yang Jingyu served as the commander and political commissar of the division. From the winter of the same year to the spring of the following year, after the Japanese Kou's "Great Suppression" was crushed by our People's Army, the anti-Japanese armed forces greatly developed, and the guerrilla zone expanded southward.
    At the Second National Congress of Workers and Peasants held in Ruijin, Jiangxi, in early 1934, Comrade Yang Jingyu was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic. In September of the same year, the First Congress of the Communist Party of China Southern Manchuria Party and the Communist Youth League was held between Mengjiang (now Jingyu County) and Huinan to discuss the instructions of the Central Committee and the Manchurian Provincial Committee, and the Provisional Committee of the Communist Party of China Southern Manchuria Local Committee was established, with Comrade Yang Jingyu as the Secretary of the Special Committee. On November 7, 1934, the 17th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the First Army of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army was declared established, with Comrade Yang Jingyu as the commander and political commissar. At this time, the troops were winning successive victories, their military strength was increasing, and their military prestige was greatly enhanced. The troops straddled the mountainous areas and vast plains of Jilin and Liaoning provinces, shaking the Japanese puppet regime and encouraging the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to actively participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation cause.
    In 1935, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was formed, and Comrade Yang Jingyu served as the commander and political commissar of the First Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army.
    In early 1936, the Southern Manchurian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China was established, and Comrade Yang Jingyu served as the secretary. In June of the same year, the eleven armies of the Anti-Japanese United Army were ordered to be reorganized into the First, Second, and Third Route Armies, with Comrade Yang Jingyu as the commander-in-chief and political commissar of the First Route Army.
    In the autumn of 1938, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous policy of "passive resistance to Japan and active anti-communism," the Japanese Kou exerted tremendous pressure on Northeast China, dispatched heavy troops, and launched a massive offensive against the Anti-Japanese United Army and various base areas. The guerrilla war entered a difficult period. In order to preserve strength, Comrade Yang Jingyu divided the troops into smaller units and dispersed them in Mengjiang, Huadian, Fusong, Linjiang, Tonghua, and other places.
    On February 18, 1940, Comrade Yang Jingyu, in order to meet with Comrade Yi Junshan to discuss anti-"encirclement" and other issues, went to Xipaizi Village in Mengjiang County and encountered the Japanese Kou, fighting for five days and nights. On February 23, he was surrounded by the enemy in Bao'an Village (now Jingyu Village), Mengjiang County. In a fierce battle, two soldiers accompanying him as guards were killed and one was wounded. Comrade Yang Jingyu was fearless and calmly fought back, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. He fought to the last and died heroically for the country.
