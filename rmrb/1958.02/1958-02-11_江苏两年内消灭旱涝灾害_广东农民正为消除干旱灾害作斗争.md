Jiangsu to Eliminate Drought and Flood Disasters Within Two Years
    Guangdong Farmers Are Fighting to Eliminate Drought Disasters
    (Our Dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, through the sectional water conservancy conference, creatively proposed a grand plan for developing small-scale farmland water conservancy on a larger scale throughout the province, based on the combination of summarizing mass experience and carrying out scientific research in light of local conditions. The task of small-scale water conservancy projects in the province jumped from 1 billion cubic meters of earthwork to 2.5 billion cubic meters. The progress of water conservancy projects can also be greatly accelerated. All drainage projects will be completed before Qingming Festival this year, all irrigation projects will be completed before Qingming Festival next year, and the finishing touches will be completed before Qingming Festival in 1960, for a total of 3.9 billion cubic meters of earthwork. After these projects are completed, the irrigated area will be expanded by more than 44 million mu, which, together with the original irrigated area, will account for 88.6% of the province's cultivated land area. The original plan to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters within three years will be completed within two years. By that time, the small-scale farmland water conservancy projects scattered throughout the province, together with the role played by large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, will enable the 100,000 square kilometers of land in Jiangsu Province to create the miracle of no danger from floods that occur once every 100 to 300 years, no flooding from rainstorms that occur every ten years, and no drought even if it does not rain for 50 to 60 days.
    Since the beginning of winter, a mass upsurge in the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects has been launched throughout Jiangsu Province. As of February 4, the average number of people participating in small-scale water conservancy projects every day reached more than 5 million, and the completed earthwork has exceeded 500 million cubic meters. The twelve counties and cities in the Huaiyin area have also launched a campaign for each full-time cadre to dig "100 cubic meters of earth." The secretaries of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the party committees of twenty-two counties and cities, including Jiangdu, Siyang, and Lishui, all went to the construction site to dig and transport earth. In order to further promote the progress of small-scale water conservancy projects and mobilize the masses on a larger scale, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the characteristics of various regions of the province, convened water conservancy conferences in Suining, Changshu, Nantong, and Nanjing, respectively, led by provincial party secretaries and responsible comrades from relevant departments and bureaus. Each conference organized representatives to visit the small-scale water conservancy projects of advanced counties, advanced townships, or advanced cooperatives, summarized many water management experiences created by the masses, and determined different water management policies for different regions. For example, the experience of Juxing Cooperative in Suining County in draining water in sections according to local contour lines and comprehensively developing ditch-dike-field systems is a model for preventing floods and droughts in plain slope areas. In 1957, many areas in this county were not flooded even after continuous rainfall for three days, with a rainfall of 175 mm. After summarizing the experience of this county, the water management policy of "emphasizing storage and combining drainage and irrigation" was determined for the entire Xuhuai plain slope area. If the water management experience of Suining County is fully promoted in the plain slope area, which accounts for one-third of the province's cultivated land area, it will play a decisive role in changing the face of agricultural production in the Xuhuai area.
    On the basis of summarizing the experience of the masses, each conference analyzed, studied, and synthesized the experience of the masses, and summarized thirteen types of engineering specifications adapted to the characteristics of various regions. These thirteen specifications generally include various situations in each type of region. For example, in hilly and mountainous areas, four different engineering specifications were researched from the experience of the masses according to the different characteristics of mountainous areas, semi-mountainous and semi-hilly areas, purely hilly areas, and semi-mountainous and semi-dike areas. With these specific specifications, the blindness of the masses in the construction of small-scale water conservancy can be greatly reduced, work efficiency can be improved, speed can be accelerated, and one cubic meter of earth can play the role of one cubic meter of earth.
    The sectional conferences not only played the role of visiting, exchanging, and summarizing experiences, but more importantly, because the conferences were personally presided over by responsible comrades of the provincial party committee, they criticized conservative ideas and clarified the earthwork tasks while visiting on the spot. Because the policies studied by the sectional conferences were clear and the methods were specific, the confidence and determination of local leading cadres were greatly enhanced.
    (Our Dispatch) The Southern Daily has recently published a series of editorials criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas in some areas, calling for boosting enthusiasm, and striving to basically eliminate drought disasters within two years. According to recent statistics, 64 of the 117 counties and cities in Guangdong Province can basically eliminate drought and flood disasters before the spring plowing; and another 36 counties and cities can achieve water conservancy by the autumn harvest. The remaining 17 counties can eliminate water and drought disasters by 1959. At present, a total of more than 610,000 projects have been started and completed throughout the province. In order to guide the smooth development of the movement, the Guangdong water conservancy departments are carrying out comprehensive planning, preparing for year-round construction, and vigorously organizing visits, promoting advanced experience, and improving construction tools and operating methods. At present, aerial soil transportation, ox-cart soil pulling, and ox-plow soil ploughing are being promoted throughout the province, and the work efficiency in many areas has been increased by two to three times to five to six times. In order to ensure the quality of the project, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently issued instructions, requiring the masses to carry out a comprehensive inspection before the Spring Festival, so as to repair any defects, make up for any leaks, and fill any gaps, to ensure that it can be used after repair, and lay a solid foundation for eliminating drought disasters.

    江苏两年内消灭旱涝灾害
    广东农民正为消除干旱灾害作斗争
    本报讯　中共江苏省委通过分片水利会议，在总结群众经验与进行科学研究相结合的基础上，创造性地提出了一个在全省范围内因地制宜地、更大规模地发展小型农田水利的宏伟计划。全省小型水利工程任务从十亿土方跳到二十五亿土方。水利工程进度也可大大加快，今年清明节以前全部完成排涝工程，明年清明前全部完成灌溉工程，到1960年清明前扫尾，一共可完成三十九亿土方的工程。这些工程完成后，将扩大灌溉面积四千四百多万亩，连同原有的灌溉面积，共占全省耕地面积的88.6％。原订三年内基本消灭旱涝灾害的规划，将提前在两年内完成。到那时全省星罗棋布的小型农田水利加上大、中型水利工程发挥的作用，就将使江苏省方圆十万平方公里的土地上，出现一百年到三百年一遇的洪水不出险，十年频率的暴雨不受涝，五十天到六十天不下雨也不受旱的奇迹。
    入冬以来，江苏全省即掀起了群众性兴修小型水利的高潮。到2月4日止，平均每天参加小型水利工程的人数达五百万人以上，完成的土方已超过五亿的数字。淮阴专区十二个县市，还开展了每个脱产干部挖“一百方土”的运动。淮阴地委和江都、泗阳、溧水等二十二个县市的党委书记都亲赴工地挖土运土。为了进一步促进小型水利工程的进度，更大规模地发动群众，江苏省委又按照本省各种不同地区的特点，由省委书记及有关部、厅负责同志在睢宁、常熟、南通、南京分片召开了水利会议。各片会议都组织代表参观了先进县、先进乡或先进社的小型水利工程，总结了许多来自群众创造的治水经验，确定了各种不同地区不同的治水方针。如睢宁县炬星社按地方等高线分段排水，全面搞沟洫圩田的经验，是平原坡地防涝防旱的榜样。这个县1957年很多地区连续下雨三天，雨量达一百七十五公厘也不受涝。总结了这个县的经验，便确定了整个徐淮平原坡地“以蓄为主，排灌兼施”的治水方针。占全省耕地面积三分之一的平原坡地，如果全部推广睢宁县的治水经验，对改变徐淮地区农业生产面貌将起决定的作用。
    在总结群众经验的基础上，各片会议又把群众的经验经过分析、研究和综合，归纳出了十三种适应各种不同地区特点的工程规格。这十三种规格大体上包括了每一种类型地区各种不同的情况。如丘陵山区，就根据山区、半山半丘陵区、纯丘陵区、半山半圩区等不同特点，从群众经验中研究出了四种不同的工程规格。有了这具体的规格，就可以大大减少各地群众在兴修小型水利中的盲目性，提高工效，加快速度，挖一方土就可以发挥一方土的作用。
    分片会议不仅起了参观、交流和总结经验的作用，更重要的是因各片会议由省委负责同志亲自主持，因此一面就地参观，一面就地批判保守思想，明确土方任务。由于分片会议研究的方针明确，办法具体，大大增强了各地领导干部的信心和决心。
    本报讯　南方日报最近连续发表社论，批判部分地区右倾保守思想，要求鼓起干劲，在两年之内作到基本上消灭旱灾。根据最近统计，广东全省一百一十七个县市中有六十四个县市在春耕以前，就可以基本消灭旱涝灾害；到秋收以前又有三十六个县市可以达到水利化。剩下的十七个县到1959年可以消灭水旱灾害。目前全省已开工和完工的工程共计六十一万多处。为了指导运动的顺利开展，广东水利部门正在进行全面规划，准备长年施工，同时大力组织参观，推广先进经验，改进施工工具和操作方法。目前，在全省范围内推广空中运土，牛车拉土，牛犁土等，许多地区的工效已提高两、三倍到五、六倍。为了保证工程质量，广东省委最近发布指示，要求在春节以前，发动群众进行一次全面检查，作到有缺就修，有漏就补，有缝就填，保证修了能用，为消灭旱灾打下坚实基础。
