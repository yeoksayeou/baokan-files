I fully agree with and warmly support Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 budget and the 1958 national budget, as well as Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft 1958 national economic plan, Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of writing reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet scheme. I guarantee to resolutely implement them in future work and strive to achieve results.

Now I would like to talk about the situation of the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province and offer some opinions. Please feel free to criticize and correct any inappropriateness.

	Establishment and Improvement of Ethnic Regional Autonomy Government - New Ethnic Relations are Constantly Growing and Consolidating

Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is a multi-ethnic area. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and like other parts of the country, it has achieved great results in just a few years. First of all, because the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee correctly implemented the Central Government and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, our Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture established and improved the ethnic regional autonomy government. People of all ethnic minorities, under the unified leadership of the state, have truly realized the right to manage their own internal affairs and be masters of their own affairs. Therefore, the ethnic estrangement, hostility, and even the cruel situation of armed fights historically left over have been fundamentally eliminated. The unity between and within ethnic groups has been strengthened day by day, and the new ethnic relations of "ethnic equality, close unity, mutual assistance, and common development" have been continuously growing and consolidating. The entire pastoral area shows a new atmosphere of unity in production and common development.

In terms of agricultural and animal husbandry production, since the second half of 1955, promoted by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization nationwide, the small agricultural areas in our prefecture have basically realized agricultural cooperativization. There are 22 advanced agricultural production cooperatives, with 1,082 participating households, accounting for 82.03% of the total number of agricultural households. Because of the superiority shown after being organized, productivity has been greatly developed. In the last year of the country's First Five-Year Plan (1957), the total sown area of various crops in the prefecture, including state-owned farms and youth collective farms, was 158,367 mu, equivalent to 4.5 times the total sown area of Haixi area in the first year of the First Five-Year Plan (1953); equivalent to more than 7 times the total sown area in the early days of liberation. In 1957, the average yield per mu was 285.34 jin. The total grain output reached 39,337,733 jin, equivalent to more than 4.8 times the total output of Haixi area in the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, and equivalent to more than 9 times the early days of liberation. Therefore, the task of increasing production in the Haixi area during the Qinghai Province's First Five-Year Plan was successfully completed. As a result, the masses of all ethnic groups in the Haixi area can not only be self-sufficient in terms of food needs but also vigorously support the country's construction and the resource exploration and development work in the Qaidam area.

	Thousands of Troops Rushing in, Men and Women, Old and Young, Working Together - Building Water Conservancy and Accumulating a Large Amount of Fertilizer to Greet a New Upsurge in Production

In 1958, we will continue to meet and strive to overfulfill the task of increasing production in the first year of the country's Second Five-Year Plan with a hundredfold confidence and perseverance. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the Central Government proposed the policy of "developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry." At the same time, it also requires us to complete various construction tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. This policy and measure of the Central Government is very correct and wise for our Haixi in Qinghai Province, as it is for all parts of the country. We must resolutely implement the policy put forward by the Central Government, which is of vital importance to accelerating China's socialist construction and catching up with or surpassing the United Kingdom in important industrial products in fifteen years. Therefore, we must resolutely implement this policy put forward by the Central Government and turn it into the actual actions of the people of all ethnic groups in our prefecture. At the same time, in order to develop agricultural production, we have also vigorously implemented the decision of the Central Government and the province to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns this winter and next spring. We have adopted various methods such as repairing canals, digging springs, digging wells, intercepting torrents, undercurrents, and building ponds to extensively build water conservancy projects to increase the irrigated area and sufficient water. In the initial plan for 1958, the irrigated area will be expanded by 50,353 mu, and the total irrigation area will reach 200,872 mu, an increase of 31.4% compared with 1957. We strive to achieve an average yield per mu of 400 jin, as required by the National Agricultural Development Program for our region. Can this production increase task be achieved? We have full confidence and conditions in this. In the small agricultural areas of our prefecture, the land is flat and the soil is fertile. As long as the leaders are determined, show revolutionary vigor, trust the masses, and rely on the masses, it is completely achievable by following the instructions of the Party and the state. For example, in 1957, the average yield per mu of the Xixing Agricultural Cooperative in Chahanwusu reached 476 jin. The yield per mu of 2.8 mu of high-yield wheat reached 1,750 jin, and the yield per mu of 1.7 mu of high-yield Qingke reached 1,800 jin. In 1957, Nuomuhong Farm planted 22,325 mu, with an average yield per mu of 339 jin, including 6.5 mu of high-yield wheat with a yield of 1,482.24 jin per mu. Now there is a farm and a cooperative that have achieved great success in grain production. Especially in their small areas of high-yield land, they have reached a figure of more than 1,400 jin per mu - this is an advanced and valuable example for our agricultural production increase. Their experience in obtaining high yields is:

	(1) Fertile land and sufficient fertilizer;

	(2) Selecting excellent varieties, sowing early at the right time, and ensuring full seedlings;

	(3) Irrigating on time, topdressing in stages, and removing weeds;

	(4) Strengthening organizational leadership, formulating plans, and conscientiously adopting new technical measures.

In the future, farms, villages, and agricultural cooperatives in our prefecture should absorb their advanced production experience, work hard, tap production potential, and greatly increase the yield per unit area, so that it is possible to achieve the target of an average yield of 400 jin per mu. In particular, the current situation in rural areas is exciting. Since the second half of 1955, the collective ownership of the means of production has been basically realized, and the rural socialist position has been further consolidated politically and ideologically through the socialist debate. The enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups for production has been greatly improved. In addition, the streamlining of institutions has decentralized a group of cadres to the production front. Under their active response to the call of the Party and the government and their promotion, a production upsurge of water conservancy construction and a large amount of fertilizer accumulation has been formed in the countryside, with thousands of troops rushing in, men and women, old and young working together in every cooperative, every household, and every person, to strive to greet the great leap forward in production in 1958.

	The Pilot Animal Husbandry Cooperatives Showed Superiority - The People of All Ethnic Groups Eliminated Doubts and Actively Asked to Run Cooperatives

In terms of animal husbandry production, the development in the past few years after liberation has also shown that it is developing at a speed that is incomparable to the old society. By 1957, the total number of various livestock in the prefecture reached 1,314,048 (heads/pieces), equivalent to 1.07 times the total number of livestock in the Haixi area in the first year of the country's First Five-Year Plan, and equivalent to 3.02 times the early days of liberation. However, the great development of animal husbandry production must also take the road of cooperativization. This point has become more and more obvious and is undoubtedly believed by people. Taking the Haixi area as an example, since the second half of 1955, five animal husbandry production cooperatives have been established on a trial basis in the pastoral areas where conditions permit. These cooperatives are healthy, and their superiority is becoming more and more obvious. In 1956, the distribution of the four cooperatives increased their income to varying degrees compared with 1955, including one cooperative where 100% of the members increased their income and two cooperatives where more than 90% of the members increased their income. According to the pre-distribution situation in 1957, the income of each cooperative increased even more than in 1956, and some increased by more than double, including one cooperative where 100% of the members increased their income and three cooperatives where more than 90% of the members increased their income. In 1957, the survival rate of livestock breeding in each cooperative reached more than 90%, which was about 8% to 10% higher than that of the local herders. Because the pilot cooperatives showed their superiority, the doubts, concerns, and misunderstandings of the people of all ethnic groups about the socialist transformation of animal husbandry were greatly eliminated in fact. After the great debate at the Second Session of the Second People's Congress of the Prefecture in October 1957, more and more people believed that only by taking the road of cooperativization can animal husbandry production have a broad development prospect and that the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is to develop animal husbandry more and better. They said: "The lamp will not be bright if it is not turned, and the words will not be clear if they are not said. Cooperativization is good." Therefore, people who were originally worried and hesitant became active, strengthened their confidence in running cooperatives, and resolutely demanded to run cooperatives in 1958. According to our statistics, the four regions under the leadership of Dulan, Tianjun, Delingha Working Committee, and Alton Quqike Kazakh Autonomous Region (district level) requested to run 42 cooperatives in 1958 and 4 public-private joint-stock farms. These regions that require to run cooperatives and farms are all mature in conditions, the masses are eager, and the leaders and representatives actively support them. Based on this situation, we have made active preparations in all aspects last winter to greet the great development of animal husbandry cooperativization in our prefecture. At the same time, I hope that the people of all pastoral areas in the country should proceed from the interests of national socialist construction and from the happiness and prosperity of their own ethnic groups, resolutely take the road of agricultural and animal husbandry cooperativization, actively publicize the various policies of the Party and the state, and constantly improve the socialist awareness of the people of all ethnic groups, and actively strive to develop production and build our country into a country with both modern industry and modern agriculture (animal husbandry) as soon as possible.

	Be Vigilant and Overcome Local Nationalism - Consolidate National Unity and Ethnic Solidarity

The reason why we have achieved the above results is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party, the close unity of cadres, especially the enthusiastic help of Han cadres, and the hard work of the people of all ethnic groups. In order to further implement the various policies and measures of the Central Government and the province, strengthen ethnic unity, and help develop the economic and cultural undertakings of ethnic minorities, the Party and the state have repeatedly proposed to overcome Han chauvinism in ethnic minority areas in the past few years. This is of course correct and has achieved good results. At the same time, the Central Government has long pointed out that it opposes both Han chauvinism and local nationalism. According to this spirit, to check the situation in our prefecture, although the local nationalist sentiment among local ethnic cadres is not serious, it has also grown among individual cadres. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant and strictly overcome it, so as not to allow it to develop to a serious point. In order to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity between all ethnic groups and promote the cause of socialist construction, we must strengthen political and ideological education among cadres, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and timely criticize these two nationalisms, strengthening ethnic unity. This is a very important work.

　　农业牧业大发展　合作化起了大作用
    官保加代表介绍青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州情况
    我完全同意并热烈拥护李先念副总理关于一九五七年预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算的报告与薄一波副总理关于一九五八年国民经济计划草案的报告，以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告，保证在今后工作中，坚决贯彻执行，努力作出成绩。
    现在我就青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州的情况，谈几点意见，有不妥之处，请各位代表批评指正。
　　建立和健全了民族区域自治政权  新的民族关系正不断增长和巩固
    海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州是一个多民族地区，在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，和全国各地一样，在短短的几年内取得了很大的成绩。首先，由于省委和省人委正确贯彻了中央和毛主席的民族政策，我们海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州建立和健全了民族区域自治政权，各少数民族人民在国家统一领导下，真正实现了管理本民族内部事务当家作主的权利。因而，从根本上消除了历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂、仇视，甚至于械斗的残酷情况。民族间及民族内部的团结日益加强，“民族平等，亲密团结，互相帮助，共同发展”新的民族关系不断地增长和巩固，整个牧区呈现了团结生产共同发展的新气象。
    在农牧业生产方面，从一九五五年下半年以来，在全国农业合作化高潮的促进下，我州小块农业区基本上实现了农业合作化，共有高级农业生产合作社二十二个，参加农户一千零八十二户，占总农户的百分之八十二点零三。由于组织起来以后，显示了它的优越性，使生产力得到广阔的发展，在国家第一个五年计划的最后一年（一九五七年），全州连同各个国营农场、青年集体农庄在内，各种作物播种面积十五万八千三百六十七亩，相当于第一个五年计划第一年（一九五三年）海西地区播种总面积的四点五倍；相当于解放初期播种总面积的七倍多。一九五七年平均单位面积产量亩产二百八十五点三四斤。粮食总产量达到三千九百三十三万七千七百三十三斤，相当于第一个五年计划第一年海西地区总产量的四点八倍多。相当于解放初期的九倍多。因之，胜利地完成了青海省第一个五年计划在海西地区的增产任务。因此，使海西地区各族群众在粮食需要方面不仅可以自足，而且还大力支援了国家建设和柴达木地区资源勘察与开发工作。
　　千军万马浩浩荡荡男女老少齐动手  兴修水利大量积肥迎接生产新高潮
    一九五八年我们还要继续以百倍的信心和毅力来迎接和努力超额完成国家第二个五年计划第一年的增产任务。在第二个五年计划期间，中央提出：“在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业与发展农业同时并举”的方针，同时还要求我们又多、又快、又好、又省地完成各项建设任务。中央的这一方针、措施，对我们青海省海西来说，和全国各地一样是非常正确而英明的。我们要坚决执行中央提出的方针，对加速我国社会主义建设和用十五年的时间，在重要工业产品方面赶上或超过英国是具有十分重要的意义。因此，我们要坚决贯彻执行中央提出的这一方针，变成我们州内各族人民的实际行动。同时，为了发展农业生产，我们还大力贯彻了中央和省关于今冬明春大规模地开展兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定，采取修渠、挖泉、挖井、拦截洪流、潜流、修池等多种多样的办法，广修水利，以增加灌溉面积和充足水量。一九五八年初步计划扩大灌溉面积五万零三百五十三亩，灌溉总数将达到二十万零八千七百二十亩，比一九五七年增加百分之三十一点四。单位面积产量争取平均达到全国农业发展纲要对我们地区要求的亩产四百斤。这个增产任务能不能达到呢？对此，我们有充分的信心和条件，在我州各小块农业区，土地平坦，土质肥沃，遵照党和国家的指示，只要领导下决心，拿出革命的干劲，相信群众，依靠群众，是完全可以达到的。比如一九五七年察汗乌苏西星农业社平均亩产达到四百七十六斤。丰产小麦二亩八分，亩产达到一千七百五十斤，丰产青稞一亩七分，亩产达到一千八百斤。诺木洪农场一九五七年播种二万二千三百二十五亩，平均亩产达到三百三十九斤，其中有丰产小麦六亩五分，亩产达到一千四百八十二点二四斤。现在有一个农场和一个社，在粮食生产上已经取得了很大的成就。特别是在它们的小块丰产地上，已经达到亩产一千四百斤以上的数字——这是我们农业增产的先进的可贵的榜样。它们获得高额丰产的经验是：
    （1）土地肥沃，肥料充足；
    （2）选择优良品种，适期早播，保证全苗；
    （3）按时灌溉，分期追肥，除净杂草；
    （4）加强组织领导，制定计划，认真采用新的技术措施。
    今后，在我们州内的农场、农庄和农业合作社，应该吸收它们的先进的生产经验，辛勤劳动，挖掘生产潜力，都可以大大提高单位面积的产量，就可能实现平均亩产四百斤的指标。特别是现在农村的情况是令人兴奋的，从一九五五年下半年以来基本上实现了生产资料集体所有制，又经过社会主义大辩论，进一步从政治上思想上巩固了农村社会主义阵地，各族人民群众生产的积极性，已经大大提高，再加上机关精简，下放了一批干部，到生产战线上去，在他们积极地响应党和政府的号召与推动下，农村已经形成了千军万马、浩浩荡荡、社社动手、人人动手、家家户户、男女老少一齐动手的兴修水利和大量积肥料的生产高潮，为迎接一九五八年的生产大跃进而努力。
    试办的畜牧业合作社显示优越性  各族群众消除怀疑积极要求办社
    在畜牧业生产方面，解放后几年来的发展，同样说明了它是以旧社会不可比拟的速度向前发展，到一九五七年，全州各种牲畜总头数达到一百三十一万四千零四十八头（只），相当于国家第一个五年计划头一年时海西地区牲畜总头数的一点零七倍，相当于解放初期的三点零二倍。但是畜牧业生产的大发展，同样必须走合作化的道路，这一点已经越来越明显，为人们相信无疑。就以海西地区来说，从一九五五年下半年以来，在牧业区有条件的试办了五个牧业生产合作社，这些社都是健康的，它的优越性越来越明显，一九五六年四个社的决分：比一九五五年不同程度的都增加了收入，其中百分之百的社员增加收入的一个社；百分之九十以上社员增加收入的两个社。一九五七年根据预分情况来看，各社比一九五六年的收入更有增加，有的增加了一倍多，其中百分之百的社员增加收入的一个社；百分之九十以上社员增加收入的三个社。一九五七年各社牲畜繁殖成活率都达到百分之九十以上，比当地牧民群众高出百分之八至十左右。由于试办的社显示了优越性，从事实上大大消除了各族群众对畜牧业社会主义改造不应有的怀疑、顾虑和误解。一九五七年十月经过州第二届人民代表大会第二次会议大辩论，越来越多的人相信了：只有走合作化的道路，畜牧业生产才有广阔的发展前途，畜牧业的社会主义改造是为了更多、更好地发展畜牧业。他们说：“灯不拨不亮，话不说不透，还是合作化好。”因此，原来还有顾虑而犹豫的人变得积极了，坚定了办社信心，坚决要求在一九五八年办社，我们统计了一下，所属都兰、天峻、德令哈工委和阿尔顿曲克哈萨克族自治区（区级）四个地区要求一九五八年办社的达到四十二个，要求办公私合营牧场的四个。这些要求办社、办场的地区都是条件成熟，群众要求迫切，头人、代表积极支持。根据这样情况，我们在去冬从各方面作了积极准备，来迎接畜牧业合作化在我州的大发展。同时，我希望全国所有各牧业区人民，都应从国家社会主义建设利益出发，从本民族的幸福、繁荣出发，坚决走农、牧业合作化的道路，积极的宣传党和国家的各项政策，不断地提高各族人民的社会主义觉悟，积极努力发展生产，把我国尽快地建设成为一个既有现代化工业又有现代化农（牧）业的国家。
    警惕和克服地方民族主义  巩固祖国统一和民族团结
    我们所以取得以上成绩，主要由于党的正确领导，干部的亲密团结，特别是汉族干部的热情帮助和各族人民群众的辛勤努力的结果。为了进一步贯彻执行中央和省的各项方针政策与措施，加强民族团结，帮助发展少数民族经济、文化事业，几年来，在少数民族地区党和国家一再提出克服大汉族主义，这当然是正确的，取得了良好的成绩，同时，中央早已指出，既反对大汉族主义，同时也反对地方民族主义，根据这种精神，检查我们州内的情况，在当地民族干部中的地方民族主义情绪虽然不严重，但是个别干部中也有所滋长，因此，必须高度警惕严加克服，不使它发展到严重的地步。为了巩固祖国的统一和各民族间的团结，推进社会主义建设事业，今后我们还要加强干部中的政治思想教育，开展批评与自我批评，及时批判这两种民族主义，加强民族团结，是十分重要的工作。
