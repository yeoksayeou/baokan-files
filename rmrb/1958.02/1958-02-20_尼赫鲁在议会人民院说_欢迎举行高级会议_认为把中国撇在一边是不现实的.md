Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 18th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated on the afternoon of February 18th in the Indian Parliament's People's House, during his response to the Parliament's debate on the speech of Indian President Prasad, that he welcomed the proposal to convene a high-level meeting of the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries.

Prime Minister Nehru said that refusing to accept this proposal "would be harmful." He also said, "Under the current circumstances, we feel that holding a meeting of foreign ministers would not lead to progress, but would lead to the adoption of a more rigid attitude."

In his reply, Nehru criticized the attitude of those countries that left a large country like China aside. He said that this attitude was unrealistic. He said that adopting such an attitude on many other issues in Asia was also unrealistic.

Commenting on Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, he believed that such a step could also create a favorable atmosphere.

In his reply, Nehru also vehemently condemned the atrocities of French aircraft bombing Tunisian villages.

    尼赫鲁在议会人民院说
    欢迎举行高级会议
    认为把中国撇在一边是不现实的
    新华社新德里18日电　印度总理尼赫鲁18日下午在印度议会人民院就议会关于印度总统普拉沙德的讲话进行的辩论作答辩时，表示欢迎召开苏联、美国和其他国家的高级会议的建议。
    尼赫鲁总理说，拒不接受这项建议“将是有害的”。他还说，“在目前情况下，我们感到举行一次外交部长会议不会导致进展，而会导致采取更加僵硬的态度。”
    尼赫鲁在答辩中批评了把中国那样的大国采取撇在一边的那些国家的态度。他说，这种态度是不现实的。他说，在对待亚洲的其他许多问题上采取这样的态度也是不现实的。
    在评论波兰提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议时，他认为这样的步骤也能够产生良好的气氛。
    尼赫鲁在答辩中还激烈地谴责了法国飞机轰炸突尼斯村庄的暴行。
