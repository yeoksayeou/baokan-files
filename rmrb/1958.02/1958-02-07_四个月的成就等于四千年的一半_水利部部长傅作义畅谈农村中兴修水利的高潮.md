I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. At the same time, I would like to talk about the current situation of farmland water conservancy construction.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee put forward the principle that industrial development and agricultural development should be carried out simultaneously on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the decision on large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation movement, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), a vigorous mass movement to build farmland water conservancy has been launched. Compared with the high tide of 1956, this movement has the following characteristics:

Scale is Large, Enthusiasm is High

First, the scale is large and the enthusiasm is high. The number of people working every day nationwide was 20 to 30 million in October, rising to 60 to 70 million in November, exceeding 80 million in December, and developing to about 100 million in January. From deep mountains to shallow mountains, to hills, to plains, to depressions, to the seaside, from the north and south of Tianshan Mountains to both sides of the Pearl River, red flags are flying everywhere, fighting against drought and flood disasters. In the coldest areas of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, the masses still persevered in construction despite the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The masses described the scene at the construction site as "a sea of red in the daytime and a sea of light at night," a sea of red is the fluttering red flags, and a sea of light is the tens of thousands of lights. "Mountains are not higher than determination, and the cold weather cannot freeze enthusiasm," this is the heroic spirit of the masses and their bold slogans.

Speed is Fast, Quality is Good

Second, the speed is fast and the quality is good. In August 1957, the National Farmland Water Conservancy Conference proposed a target of expanding the irrigated area by 44.08 million mu in 1958. The Fourth Rural Work Conference convened by the Central Rural Work Department in October revised it to 61.84 million mu. The National Planning Conference convened by the State Economic Commission in December further revised it to 92.21 million mu. However, according to statistics as of January 31, the actual completed figure nationwide has reached 117.98 million mu, overfulfilling the annual plan in 120 days. Among them, Hebei Province has completed 25.42 million mu, Henan Province has completed 22.52 million mu, Shandong Province has completed 13.33 million mu, and Anhui Province has completed 1.74 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. According to the current situation, the average daily increase in irrigated area nationwide can be about one million mu. Judging from this amazing speed, the national expansion of irrigated area will greatly increase, and the original planned targets in various places are constantly being adjusted. At the same time, various regions have also carried out tremendous work on water and soil conservation, depression management, and improvement of existing irrigated areas. According to statistics as of January 31, the preliminary controlled area of soil and water conservation has completed 45,269 square kilometers, the area of depression management has completed 74.52 million mu, and the area of improved irrigation has completed 52.78 million mu. The large number of farmland water conservancy projects built this year, from the beginning of construction, leaders at all levels paid attention to implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and attached great importance to project quality. During the construction process, inspections and comparisons were constantly organized, and formal acceptance was required after the completion of larger projects. Therefore, the quality of the projects done in various places this year is generally good.

Rely on Mass Wisdom to Create Rich Experience

Third, relying on the wisdom of the masses, created more and better experiences. On the basis of the 1956 water conservancy upsurge, various regions continued to implement the principle of adapting to local conditions, and created many relatively mature experiences for various different natural conditions. In the past, our treatment of depressed and waterlogged areas always considered drainage more, resulting in high labor costs and small effects. Tianjin and Cangxian prefectures in Hebei Province, based on the natural characteristics of depressed and waterlogged areas, adopted the policy of adapting, restricting, utilizing, and transforming, relying on the masses, and created the experience of transforming depressed land into rice fields, turning the original saline-alkali wasteland into a treasure land with a yield of 300 to 1,200 catties of grain per mu. The masses said this was "a step to heaven." In the past, some people believed that plains could be water conservancy-ized, but mountains could not. However, in the high tide, the masses created a lot of experience in mountain water conservancy-ization. Dongliang Mountain in Wushan County, Gansu Province, is a dry mountain beam with an altitude of more than 1,900 meters. The people here suffered from drought in the past. After cooperation, they were determined to compete with the heavens. Relying on the determination of the leadership, relying on the wisdom of the masses and the strength of the collective, they built a 60-mile-long canal, opened up mountains and ridges, crossed cliffs and deep valleys, and finally brought the Niehe River water to Dongliang Mountain, turning more than 30,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land, and some of it was planted with rice. In the southern provinces, although there is more rainfall, before cooperation, under the production conditions of each household, the pond and dam water sources could not be adjusted to each other, and most of them had low drought resistance. If it did not rain for dozens of days, some ponds and dams would dry up. Now, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hubei and other places have created the experience of "long vines bearing melons" on the basis of cooperation. According to the terrain conditions, the channels and ponds are linked together, the water sources are uniformly allocated, and the surplus is used to make up for the deficiencies, forming a complete irrigation system, saving water, expanding the irrigation area, and greatly improving drought resistance. In the 1956 upsurge, the scope of water conservancy project planning was mostly one township and one cooperative, and the goals either focused on drought prevention and drought resistance, or simply paid attention to drainage. This year, there has been a new development. The scope of planning in many areas has developed from one township and one cooperative to one county, one prefecture, or a small river basin. The management methods are from slope to foot of the mountain, from plain to depression, and various types of projects cooperate with each other for comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization. The first to create this experience was the Mang River Basin in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province. As a result, soil erosion was controlled in the mountainous areas, rice fields were planted in the depressions, and the first small hydropower station began to be built along the river. In 1956, under the condition of 120 mm of daily rainfall, the Mang River flood was reduced from 500 cubic meters per second to 70 cubic meters per second. Now this experience has been promoted in many places and has been creatively developed.

Politics Plus Technology, Hard Work Plus Perseverance

Fourth, politics plus technology, hard work plus perseverance, have cultivated a large number of cadres who are both red and expert in the water conservancy movement. Leading comrades at all levels went deep into the construction sites, learning from workers, learning from farmers, and learning from technicians. Many secretaries of the prefectural and county committees, commissioners, county heads, and leaders of townships and cooperatives have transformed from laymen into experts and become experts in water conservancy work. After mastering water conservancy technology, they can better combine the wisdom of the masses to solve key problems in their work. They are not only political leaders, but also production technicians, and also direct laborers.

It should be especially pointed out here that the active and proactive support of relevant departments in this year's water conservancy movement is a great force in promoting the development of the high tide. Taking farmland water conservancy drainage and irrigation machinery as an example, more than 500,000 horsepower will be produced this year, and it is planned to increase it to more than 700,000 horsepower, of which more than 200,000 horsepower of machinery can be supplied to farmers before April this year. Other departments such as agriculture, forestry, meteorology, railways, transportation, materials supply and marketing, and scientific research also regard actively cooperating with the water conservancy movement as an important task.

In the past eight years, with the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the efforts of the people across the country, great achievements have been made in water conservancy construction nationwide. However, the scale, speed, and endless potential of this year's water conservancy movement are really amazing. Before liberation, our ancestors opened up 230 million mu of irrigated land in four thousand years. Now, 117 million mu have been opened up in four months. The achievements in four months are equal to half of four thousand years. If you are not there, you dare not believe it. Where does this heroic spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm come from?

First of all, the consolidation and development of the cooperative system has organized 500 million farmers, turning the scattered individual economy into a powerful collective force. Therefore, they are eager to expand production, increase yields, and quickly get rid of poverty and backwardness, and they also have such conditions and such strength. The liberated productive forces and the awakened masses can do miracles that no one has ever dared to imagine. Therefore, if the farmers in the era of individual economy were treading in place or moving forward slowly, the farmers currently organized under the leadership of the working class are striding forward. Especially through rectification, anti-rightist struggle, and the great socialist debate, the leftists defeated the rightists, and the active and progressive thinking overwhelmed the passive, conservative, and dogmatic thinking. At the same time, cadres at all levels further overcame bureaucratic-ism, sectarian-ism, and subjectivism, and the relationship between leaders and the masses became closer. Many leading comrades of prefectural and county committees moved their offices to the countryside, to the construction sites, and to the forefront of the water conservancy movement, participating in production and leading production. The recent transfer of a large number of cadres to the countryside will also have a great effect on the development of agricultural production. It can not only comprehensively train cadres in labor, but also promote the technical revolution in agricultural production by bringing culture and technology to the countryside. At the same time, this wise measure fundamentally breaks the old concept of "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior," which has been entrenched in people's minds for thousands of years. Labor is glorious, the atmosphere has changed greatly, and it will have a profound impact on the entire socialist cause of the country.

Finally, and most fundamentally, all of this should be attributed to the wise and strong leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Party is the organizer, leader, and inspirer of all undertakings in our new China. After the great airing of views, great debates, and great struggle, the Party's prestige among the masses has been further enhanced. In the rectification movement, the rightists said that the Party could not lead this and the Party could not lead that. However, the people of the whole country said that the Party can lead this and the Party can lead that. Not only can it lead, but it can lead well. Where there is no Party leadership, nothing can be accomplished. Countless facts have proven a truth: the path pointed out by the Party is never wrong. Wherever the Party points, the people of the whole country will swarm there with the strength of thousands of troops and horses and overwhelming power. There are no enemies that cannot be defeated and no undertakings that cannot be completed. In the past, people often said that we are an ancient nation. Under the leadership of the Party, our nation has rejuvenated and has a bright future. Indeed, in history, our nation has a glorious and long past, but more importantly, under the leadership of the Party, 600 million people have seen a more distant and brighter future for themselves. This is the source of our strength to overcome difficulties and create miracles. Our industry, after fifteen years, will strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom, the first country to implement the industrial revolution, in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products. Our agriculture, on the basis of being organized, will also gradually implement the technical revolution and mechanization and electrification. After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), 65 counties and cities across the country have reached the targets set by the program in terms of the average yield per mu of grain ten years ahead of schedule, and eight "thousand-catty counties" have emerged. Many northern regions with lower yields have put forward bold slogans, saying that the unit area yield should "cross the Yellow River openly and cross the Yangtze River secretly." The National Agricultural Development Program originally stipulated that the requirement of "four, five, and eight" should be achieved in 1967. Now it seems that it can be greatly advanced. Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces have proposed that this target can be achieved in five years or a little longer. In terms of water conservancy construction, this year, the irrigated area has been expanded by 117 million mu in four months, and the national irrigated area has reached more than 630 million mu, with an average of one mu of paddy field or irrigated land per person. Judging from this speed, after several more water conservancy upsurges, the irrigated area of our country can reach more than one billion mu, basically realizing water conservancy, and completing the requirement of basically eliminating ordinary floods and droughts within twelve years as proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule. When construction of the Sanmenxia Reservoir on the Yellow River began, some comrades were very concerned about when the soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River could be effective because they were worried that the reservoir would be filled with sediment. Now it seems that although there are still many difficulties in the work of soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the difficulties can be overcome and soil and water conservation will definitely be completed ahead of schedule. The clearness of the Yellow River can be seen in the era of Mao Zedong. Our great and young motherland has infinite resources and infinite potential. Six hundred million people are of one heart and one mind, striving for a common goal. We will surely be able to build our motherland into a great, prosperous, and civilized country in the shortest possible time. The Chinese people have long been oppressed by domestic and foreign enemies, living a life of humiliation and hopelessness. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they have overthrown oppression, established confidence, liberated the productive forces, and also liberated people's thinking. They are moving forward with a lively and vigorous spirit, and everyone feels proud and proud. I am a person from the old society. I am very lucky and excited to be able to personally participate in the great socialist construction of our country and humbly learn from workers, learn from farmers, and learn from all advanced producers.

　　四个月的成就等于四千年的一半
    水利部部长傅作义畅谈农村中兴修水利的高潮
    我完全同意李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理和吴玉章主任的报告，同时，愿意谈一谈当前农田水利建设进行的情况。
    自从党的三中全会对国家建设提出了在优先发展重工业的基础上发展工业与发展农业同时并举的方针，中共中央和国务院发布了关于大规模地兴修农田水利和积肥运动的决定，中共中央公布了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），广大群众兴修农田水利的运动就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。这个运动和一九五六年的高潮相比，有以下的特点：
    规模大　干劲足
    首先是规模大，干劲足。全国每天出工人数，十月份是两三千万人，十一月份上升为六七千万人，十二月份超过了八千万人，一月份发展到一亿人左右。从深山到浅山，到丘陵，到平原，到洼地，到海边，从天山南北，到珠江两岸，到处红旗招展，与旱涝灾害进行着斗争，在最寒冷的黑龙江和内蒙地区，群众仍冒着零下三十度的严寒坚持施工。群众形容工地的景色是“白天一片红，晚上一片明”，一片红是红旗飘扬，一片明是万盏灯火。“山高高不过决心，天冷冻不了热心”，这就是群众的英雄气概和他们所提出的豪迈口号。
    速度快　质量好
    第二是速度快，质量好。一九五七年八月，在全国农田水利会议上提出的一九五八年扩大灌溉面积的指标是四千四百零八万亩，十月份中央农村工作部召开的第四次农村工作会议修改为六千一百八十四万亩，十二月份国家经委召开的国家计划会议又修改为九千二百二十一万亩，可是据截至一月三十一日的统计，全国实际完成的数字，已经达到一亿一千七百九十八万亩，用一百二十天的时间超额完成了全年计划。其中河北省已完成二千五百四十二万亩，河南省完成二千二百五十二万亩，山东省完成一千三百三十三万亩，安徽省已做了土石方十七亿四千万公方。按现在的情况，平均全国每天可以增加灌溉面积约一百万亩，以这种惊人的速度来看，全国扩灌面积还要大大地增加，各地原订的计划指标都在不断地进行调整。与此同时，各地对水土保持、洼地治理和改善现有灌溉面积也都进行了巨大的工作，截至一月三十一日统计，水土保持初步控制面积已完成四万五千二百六十九平方公里，洼地治理面积已完成七千四百五十二万亩，改善灌溉面积已完成五千二百七十八万亩。今年修筑的大量的农田水利工程，在开始兴修的时候，各级领导就都注意贯彻了多、快、好、省的方针，十分重视工程质量。在施工过程中不断地组织检查评比，较大的工程完成后要进行正式验收。所以今年各地所做的工程一般质量是好的。
　　依靠群众智慧创造丰富经验
    第三，依靠群众的智慧，创造了又多又好的经验。在一九五六年水利高潮的基础上，各地继续贯彻因地制宜的原则，针对各种不同的自然条件，创造了许多比较成熟的经验。过去我们对于洼涝地区的治理，总是多考虑排水，结果是费工大，效果小。河北省天津、沧县等专区根据洼涝地区的自然特点，采取适应、限制、利用、改造的方针，依靠群众，创造了改造洼地改种稻田的经验，使着原来的盐碱荒地，变成了每亩产粮三四百斤到一千二百斤的宝地，群众说这是“一步登天”。过去有人认为平原可以水利化，山区不能水利化，但是在高潮中群众创造了很多山区水利化的经验。甘肃省武山县东梁山是个拔海一千九百多公尺的旱山梁，这里人民过去受尽了旱灾的苦，合作化后，他们坚决要与老天比高低，他们依靠领导的决心，依靠群众的智慧和集体的力量，修了六十里长的渠道，开山辟岭，跨过断崖深谷，终于把聂河水引上了东梁山，使三万多亩旱地变成了水浇地，并且有一部分种植了水稻。南方各省，雨水虽然较多，但是在合作化以前，在一家一户的生产条件下，塘坝水源不能互相调剂，多数抗旱能力很低，几十天不下雨，有的塘坝就干涸了，现在云南、贵州、湖北等地，在合作化的基础上创造了“长藤结瓜”的经验，根据地形条件，把渠道和水塘联结起来，水源统一调配，以有余补不足，形成了一个完整的灌溉系统，节约了水量，扩大了灌溉面积，大大提高了抗旱能力。在一九五六年高潮中，水利工程规划的范围多数是一乡一社，目标或者偏重于防旱抗旱，或者单纯的注意排水，今年有了新的发展，规划的范围已经有很多地区由一乡一社发展至一个县、一个专区或一个小河流域，治理的方法，是从坡面到山脚，从平川到洼地，多种多样的工程互相配合，全面开发，综合利用。首先创造这一种经验的是河南省新乡专区的漭河流域，结果在山区控制了水土流失，在洼地改种了稻田，沿河开始修筑起第一座小型水力发电站，一九五六年在日雨量一百二十公厘的情况下，漭河洪水由五百秒公方降低到七十秒公方。现在这一经验已在很多地方推广，并且有了创造性的发展。
    政治加技术　干劲加钻劲
    第四，政治加技术，干劲加钻劲，在水利运动中培养了大批又红又专的干部。各级党政领导同志都是深入工地，向工人学习，向农民学习，向技术人员学习，很多地委县委书记、专员、县长、乡社领导干部都已经变外行为内行，成为水利工作的专家。他们掌握了水利技术以后，就能更好地结合群众的智慧，解决工作中的关键问题，他们既是政治领导者，又是生产技术员，也是直接劳动者。
    在这里应该特别提出，在今年的水利运动中，各有关部门积极主动的支援，是促进高潮发展的一个很大的力量。单就农田水利排灌机械一项来说，今年就要生产五十多万马力，还计划增加到七十多万马力，其中有二十多万马力的机械，可以在今年四月以前供应到农民手里。其他农、林、气象、铁道、交通、物资供销以及科学研究等等部门也都把主动配合水利运动当作了自己的一个重要的任务。
    八年来，在中央的正确领导和全国人民的努力下，全国水利建设获得了很大的成就，但是像今年水利运动这样的规模，这样的速度，这样无穷无尽的潜力，实在令人惊奇。解放前，我们的祖先四千年开辟了两亿三千万亩的灌溉面积，现在四个月开辟了一亿一千七百多万亩，四个月的成绩等于四千年的一半，若非身临其境，真是不敢相信。这种英雄气概和革命干劲究竟是从何而来呢？
    首先是合作化制度的巩固和发展，把五亿农民组织起来，使分散的个体经济，变成为强大的集体力量，因而他们迫切要求扩大生产，提高产量，迅速摆脱贫困落后的状态，而且他们也有了这样的条件，有了这样的力量。解放了的生产力，觉醒了的群众，可以干出前无古人的谁也不敢想像的奇迹来。所以如果说个体经济时代的农民是原地踏步或慢腾腾地前进，目前在工人阶级领导下组织起来的农民，则是大踏步地前进。特别是通过整风、反右、社会主义大辩论，左派战胜了右派，积极的前进的思想压倒了消极的因循保守的思想。同时各级干部进一步克服了官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的作风，领导与群众的关系更加密切，许多地委县委等领导同志，都把办公室搬到农村，搬到工地，搬到水利运动的最前线，参加生产，领导生产。最近大批干部下放到农村，也将对农业生产的发展有很大作用。既能在劳动中全面地锻炼干部，文化下乡，技术下乡，也将直接促进农业生产的技术革命，同时，这一英明的措施根本打破了几千年来盘据在人们脑子里的“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的陈腐观念，劳动光荣，风气大变，对全国整个社会主义事业都将发生深远的影响。
    最后，最根本的说，这一切都应该归功于中国共产党的英明的坚强的领导。党是我们新中国一切事业的组织者，领导者，鼓舞者。在经过大鸣大放大争大辩之后，党在群众中的威信更加提高。在整风运动中，右派分子说，党不能领导这，党不能领导那，但全国人民说，党既能领导这，也能领导那，不但能领导，而且领导得好，那里没有党的领导，那里就一事无成。无数事实证明了一条真理，党指出的道路永远没有错，党指向那里，全国人民就以千军万马、排山倒海的力量拥向那里，没有不能战胜的敌人，没有不能完成的事业。过去人们常说我们是个古老的民族，在党的领导下，我们的民族已经返老还童，前途远大。诚然，在历史上，我们的民族有着光荣的悠久的过去，但是更重要的是在党的领导下，六亿人民看见了自己更远大更灿烂的未来，这是我们战胜困难创造奇迹的力量的源泉。我们的工业，在十五年后，要争取在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过全世界最先实行工业革命的英国。我们的农业，在组织起来的基础上也要逐步实行技术革命和机械化、电气化。在全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布以后，全国已经有六十五个县、市在粮食每亩平均产量上提前十年达到了纲要所提出的指标，并且出现了八个千斤县。北方许多产量较低的地区，都提出豪迈的口号，说单位面积产量要“明渡黄河，暗渡长江”。全国农业发展纲要原来规定在一九六七年实现“四、五、八”的要求，现在看来，可以大大提前，浙江、广东、江苏、山东、安徽、江西等省都已提出五年或者较多一点的时间就可达到这一指标。在水利建设方面，今年用四个月的时间扩大灌溉面积一亿一千七百多万亩，全国灌溉面积已经达到六亿三千多万亩，每人平均一亩水田或水浇地。按这样的速度来看，再经过几个水利高潮就可以使我国的灌溉面积达到十亿多亩，基本上实现水利化，提前五年完成全国农业发展纲要所提出在十二年内基本上消灭普通的水灾和旱灾的要求。在开始修筑黄河三门峡水库时，有些同志因为担心水库被泥沙淤满，非常关心黄河中游的水土保持什么时候能够发挥效益，现在看来，虽然黄河中游的水土保持在工作中还有很多困难，但是困难都是可以克服的，水土保持一定能够提前完成，黄河之清，在毛泽东时代是可以看到的。我们伟大而年青的祖国，资源无穷，潜力无穷，六亿人民一条心，一股劲，奔赴一个共同的目标，我们一定能在最短期间把祖国建成为一个伟大、富强、文明的国家。中国人民长期地受着国内外敌人的压迫，过着屈辱的没有希望的生活，现在，在共产党和毛主席领导下，推翻了压迫，树立了信心，解放了生产力，也解放了人们的思想，正在以生龙活虎、朝气蓬勃的精神，向前迈进，每个人都感到自豪和骄傲。我是一个从旧社会来的人，能够亲身参加我国伟大的社会主义建设，虚心地向工人学习，向农民学习，向一切先进生产者学习，觉得非常幸运，非常兴奋。
