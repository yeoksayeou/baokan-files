    Gambling Sweeps Britain
    British gamblers squandered a staggering 555 million pounds on gambling last year!
    This figure was released by a Church of England study group on gambling. The figure shows that Britons gambled away seven million pounds more last year than the year before. Of this huge sum, more than half was lost on horse racing. In addition, dog racing and football matches have become great opportunities for British gamblers to gamble.

    赌风遍英国
    去年英国的赌徒因为赌博，竟挥霍掉五亿五千五百万英镑！
    这是英国圣公会研究赌博问题小组委员会公布的数字。这个数字表明：英国人去年赌掉的钱比前年的还要多七百万英镑。在这笔巨款中，有一半以上是赛马输掉的。此外，赛狗和足球赛也成了英国赌徒们聚赌的大好机会。
