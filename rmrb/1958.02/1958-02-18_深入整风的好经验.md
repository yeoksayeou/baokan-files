Good Experience in Deepening the Rectification Campaign
Cao Baoming

The Wuhan No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory's organization of cadres and masses to visit and learn from rural areas and small enterprises is a good experience.

Currently, some factories' rectification campaigns are not thorough enough, but under the influence of this nationwide ideological movement, some new features have emerged in production. As a result, some leading cadres in these enterprises have developed illusions, regarding individual new features in production as the arrival of a climax; especially upon seeing the production climax already arriving in other units, they fail to analyze their own situation calmly, relax the rectification campaign, and are eager to focus on organizing a production climax as the center of their work. The result is that production lacks a political and ideological foundation, and the climax is delayed.

The Wuhan No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory did not adopt this attitude. They were not satisfied with the fact that nearly 90% of the problems had been corrected and that most people were relatively satisfied. They further organized cadres and masses to visit and learn from rural areas and small enterprises, using the vivid things there to infect and inspire everyone, so that everyone could take these advanced figures and advanced ideas as examples, compare themselves, and demand of themselves. This further clarified everyone's understanding of the working class's leading responsibility, the relationship between the individual and the country, improving living standards and developing production, democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline. This, in turn, made many previously difficult problems easily solved, and allowed the two climaxes of rectification and production to appear simultaneously, with the movement developing broadly, deeply, and vigorously.

In the past, learning from the advanced in industry mostly referred to learning advanced experience in production management and technical operations, which was business learning. Its activities were often limited to factories with similar production nature and roughly the same technical conditions. This time, the Wuhan No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory's proposal to learn from the advanced is to learn advanced ideas and advanced work styles, which is political learning. Factories, rural areas, shops, and schools can all be visited for learning, which is a new development in ideological education work. Combining these two kinds of learning, going wherever there is advancement to learn, can enable us to continuously improve our political and ideological level and our business and technical level, so that the cause of socialist construction can continue to leap forward.

    深入整风的好经验
    曹葆铭
    武汉国棉一厂组织干部和群众去农村和小企业参观、学习，是个好经验。
    现在有些工厂整风很不彻底，但在这个全民性的思想大运动影响下，也在生产上出现了一些新气象。于是，这些企业里的一些领导干部便发生了错觉，把生产上的个别新气象当做高潮已经出现；特别是看见别的单位生产高潮已经到来，便不冷静地分析自己的情况，放松了整风，急于以组织生产高潮为中心来开展工作。这样做的结果，生产缺乏政治思想基础，高潮反而迟迟不能出现。
    武汉国棉一厂不是采取这样的态度。他们没有满足已经改了将近90％的问题和多数人已经比较满意的情况，进一步组织干部和群众去农村和小企业参观学习，用那里的活生生的事物来感染大家，激励大家，使大家以这些先进人物、先进思想为榜样，对比自己，要求自己。这就使大家对工人阶级的领导责任，对个人与国家、改善生活与发展生产、民主与集中、自由与纪律等问题，在思想上进一步明确起来，进而使原来难于解决的许多问题迎刃而解，使整风与生产两个高潮同时出现，运动发展得很广，很深，很猛。
    学习先进，过去在工业上大多指学习生产管理和技术操作方面的先进经验，是业务学习，其活动也往往限制在生产性质相同而技术条件也大体相同的工厂里。武汉国棉一厂这次提出学习先进，是学习先进思想和先进作风，是政治学习，无论工厂、农村、商店和学校都可去学习，是思想教育工作的新发展。把这两种学习结合起来，哪里有先进，就到哪里学，就能使我们不断地提高政治思想水平和业务技术水平，使社会主义建设事业不断地向前飞跃发展。
