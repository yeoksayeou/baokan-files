Xinhua News Agency, February 16th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Zhuofei reports: The rectification movement in central state organs is currently experiencing a new surge, setting off a massive anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign. Various organs have already posted 250,000 big-character posters against waste, and the momentum of the movement is exceptionally rapid. Now, many units are proposing to muster their energy and ensure that the fire of anti-waste burns brightly everywhere. Through this movement, they aim to fight an "annihilation battle" in the economic, political, and ideological spheres.

After several high tides of the rectification movement, the masses' ideological awareness has been greatly enhanced. They have skillfully mastered the democratic methods of great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters. Once the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement was mobilized, many units posted tens of thousands of big-character posters within two or three days. Some individuals posted more than a hundred big-character posters, creating a lively, vibrant, and magnificent spectacle. The posters targeted every aspect of work, thought, and life. In addition to the posters, 312 anti-waste exhibitions were held within the central state organs, and 354 youth anti-waste shock brigades were organized. Judging from the intensity of the movement and the enthusiasm of the masses, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has surpassed previous airing movements. The trend of the movement is, in effect, to take anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the guideline, forming a grand summary of the First Five-Year Plan and a major inspection of shortcomings.

Faced with the rising revolutionary fervor of the people across the country, especially the vigorous revolutionary drive reflected in the recent Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress, leading cadres of various organs have been greatly encouraged. None are willing to lag behind. They personally took the lead, deeply mobilizing the masses and competing in drive by taking the lead in airing their views. In the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, cadres at the section chief level and above universally took the lead in posting big-character posters, setting themselves on fire and setting fire to all wasteful phenomena that should be burned. This ministry has 8,000 people. In the first few days, the number of big-character posters increased by 4,000 to 5,000 each day, and later increased to more than 10,000. The leadership originally estimated that each person might post an average of three big-character posters, but now it is estimated that each person may post ten. By the 15th, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry had already posted more than 60,000 big-character posters. The posters formed a blazing sea of fire, burning into every corner, and the quality was relatively high. Everyone was mobilized, and they want to compete in this airing movement to see who has the greater drive and who contributes more to the country's construction cause.

The determination and energy of the leading cadres are also reflected in their ability to go deep into grassroots units to air their views together with the masses and personally inspect waste. A vice minister of the Ministry of Public Security led an anti-waste inspection team to inspect eight warehouses and discovered many serious cases of waste, promoting the in-depth development of the movement.

The actual situation proves that those who lack enthusiasm in airing views are those whose leadership lacks revolutionary drive and exhibits a lifeless atmosphere. In order to quickly catch up with the advanced and eliminate backward phenomena, many units have sent representatives to visit advanced units. The Party Committee of Central State Organs also specifically convened an enlarged meeting on the 16th, where advanced units such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Trade introduced their experiences in carrying out the anti-waste movement to promote the backward units to catch up. Some units organized mutual observation, forming a revolutionary competition. They put forward the slogan of "three comparisons" in the observation, namely, comparing big-character posters, comparing depth and thoroughness, and comparing drive. Some units also organized leading cadres to conduct evaluations on the spot where the big-character posters were posted, or convened meetings on the spot to promote the backward to catch up with the advanced.

In recent days, dozens of organs have gone to the Livestock Products Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which has done a good job in airing views, to visit the site. Under the leadership of leading cadres, an average of 26 big-character posters have been posted per person, and one cadre has posted 135 big-character posters, all of high quality. This company is full of revolutionary spirit in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. The leadership assigns combat tasks every day, requiring all staff to use their spare time, everyone to use their brains and hands, to make the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement deep and thorough.

The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has promoted the wisdom of the masses and mustered revolutionary drive, which has exposed a large number of astonishing waste phenomena and some serious conservative ideas to the masses, giving people a most vivid education in building the country and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and inspiring people on how to tap those infinite potentials. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Light Industry after great airing and blooming, there was 100 million yuan worth of waste in design, capital construction, production, and other aspects during the First Five-Year Plan period. In 1957 alone, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry suffered losses of more than 17 million yuan due to drilling accidents nationwide. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, due to poor planning and mismanagement in design, construction, and material supply, resulted in idle work, shutdowns, and absenteeism of contracting enterprises, equivalent to 6% of the total actual working days, which is equivalent to 458 people not working for a year. The reasons for these wasteful phenomena are partly due to lack of experience and partly due to the bureaucracy and subjectivism of leading cadres. Cadres sharply criticized the shortcomings of leading cadres in this regard and hoped that they would learn from these lessons in the anti-waste struggle.

The situation in many organs proves that the anti-waste struggle has greatly exceeded its economic significance. Through anti-waste, it is necessary to kill two birds with one stone, burn away political and ideological waste phenomena, and eliminate official air, moribund air, extravagant air, arrogant air, and pampered air. According to preliminary revelations, the problems in this regard are prominently manifested in the waste of manpower. Because some organs have official air and moribund air, the degree of lax labor discipline and high absenteeism is quite alarming. The Foreign Languages Press has long been moribund. In the half year from June to November 1957 alone, a total of 241 months and 4 days were lost due to personal leave, absenteeism, and lateness, with an average of 41 people not working each month. Some photographic reporters in one unit of this publishing house spent two to three months of the year doing nothing. More seriously, some staff members simply do not work during office hours, but instead engage in activities such as fighting crickets and doing crossword puzzles. In many departments, the masses sharply criticized official air, extravagant air, and pampered air. Some bureau-level leading cadres in some departments of the Ministry of Agriculture specifically made long-distance calls before returning from business trips to have the ministry send cars to pick them up. The masses criticized this as being too pampered. Some research staff in the scientific research institutions of the Ministry of Agriculture are also very pampered. For example, some staff members do not do it themselves, and even basic processes such as observation, recording, and operation are handed over to trainees or even untrained temporary staff, resulting in numerous errors. The masses ridiculed these researchers as "Jia Baoyu." Some scientific research departments also proposed to oppose fame in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, because some scientific researchers, in order to become famous, focused solely on obtaining associate doctoral degrees and abandoned their professional work, causing great losses to the work.

Many units have proposed that without opposing waste and conservatism, it is impossible to eliminate official air and moribund air, and it is impossible to better muster revolutionary drive and achieve a great leap forward in production. In actual struggle, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry put forward twelve slogans, including opposing waste, building the country diligently and thriftily; comparing with the advanced, making a great leap forward; opposing conservatism, sweeping away moribund air; opposing dogmatism, speaking practically; setting oneself on fire, eliminating official air and arrogant air; changing customs and habits, eliminating extravagant air; promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism, breaking with individualism; accounting for both economic and political matters; carrying out great rectification and great transformation, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, enriching the content of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. The leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is determined to fight the anti-waste and anti-conservatism battle to the end, planning to increase profits for the country by more than 100 million yuan in 1958. At the recent National Salt Affairs Work Conference, the Ministry of Food Industry combined the discussion of issues raised in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, overcame conservative ideas, mustered enthusiasm, and decided to rely on agricultural cooperatives to increase this year's construction scale from the original 8 million tons of salt to 12 to 13 million tons of salt without the state increasing a single penny of investment.

Currently, a small number of units lack enthusiasm in opposing waste and conservatism. The leading cadres of these units do not yet recognize the significant economic and political significance of conducting anti-waste in in-depth rectification. They view the in-depth rectification movement as very simple. For example, one unit of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives proposed an extremely simple plan on how to carry out anti-waste: two days of airing views, two days of debate, and two days of rectification. Such a plan is clearly bureaucratic and cannot achieve any results. Some units, after mobilization, make a lot of noise but little rain. Leading cadres are not seen taking the lead in posting big-character posters, nor are they seen going deep into the grassroots to mobilize the masses. They themselves are moribund and lack drive, so naturally, the movement cannot be deepened.

### 在经济上、政治上、思想上再打一个“歼灭战”  反浪费反保守一箭三雕  中央国家机关掀起整风运动的新高潮，以反浪费反保守为纲，形成对第一个五年计划的大总结，对缺点的大检查

    在经济上、政治上、思想上再打一个“歼灭战”
    反浪费反保守一箭三雕
    中央国家机关掀起整风运动的新高潮，以反浪费反保守为纲，形成对第一个五年计划的大总结，对缺点的大检查
    新华社16日讯　新华社记者王濯非报道：中央国家机关的整风运动目前正出现一个新的洪峰，掀起了声势浩大的反浪费反保守运动。各机关已经贴出了二十五万张反浪费的大字报，运动的来势异常迅猛。现在，许多单位提出，要鼓足干劲，一定把反浪费的大火烧个满天通红，通过这个运动，在经济上、政治上、思想上打个“歼灭战”。
    经过了整风运动的几个高潮之后，群众的思想觉悟已经大大提高，他们熟练地掌握了大鸣大放大争大辩的民主方式，反浪费反保守运动一经动员之后，许多单位两三天之内便贴出了上万张的大字报。有的一个人贴出了一百多张大字报，真是生动活泼，洋洋大观，大字报烧到了工作、思想和生活的各个方面。除了大字报以外，在中央国家机关内还举办了三百一十二个反浪费展览会，组织了三百五十四个青年反浪费突击队。从运动来势之猛烈、群众情绪之踊跃来看，反浪费反保守运动超过了以前数次鸣放运动。运动发展的趋势，实际上是以反浪费反保守为纲，形成了对第一个五年计划的大总结，对缺点的大检查。
    面对着全国人民高涨的革命热情，特别是最近召开的第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上所反映出来的蓬勃的革命干劲，各机关的领导干部都受到很大的鼓舞，个个都不甘落后，他们亲自挂帅出马，深入发动群众，并且以自己带头鸣放来比干劲。冶金工业部处长以上干部普遍带头贴大字报，引火烧身，也引火烧一切应该烧的浪费现象。这个部共有八千人，开始几天，每天增加四五千张大字报，以后增加到一万多张，领导上原估计每人平均可能贴出三张大字报，现在估计每人可能贴出十张大字报。到15日为止，冶金部的大字报已经达到六万多张。大字报形成了熊熊的火海，烧到了每个角落，而且质量都比较高。所有的人都发动起来，他们要在这个鸣放运动中，比比谁的干劲大，比比谁对祖国的建设事业多贡献出一份力量和心血。
    领导干部的决心大、劲头足还表现在他们都能够深入基层单位同群众一起鸣放，亲自检查浪费情况。公安部一位副部长率领反浪费检查小组检查了八个仓库，发现了很多严重的浪费现象，推动了运动的深入展开。
    实际情况证明，鸣放劲头不大的，都是领导上革命干劲不足，表现了暮气沉沉。为了迅速赶上先进，消灭落后现象，许多单位都派出代表到先进单位去参观。中央国家机关党委还在16日专门召开了扩大会议，由冶金工业部和对外贸易部等先进单位介绍开展反浪费运动的经验，促进落后单位赶上去。有的单位组织互相观摩，形成了革命的竞赛，他们在观摩中提出了“三比”的口号，即是比大字报，比深透，比劲头。有的单位还组织领导干部在贴大字报的现场进行评比，或者在现场召开会议，推动落后赶先进。
    最近几天以来，有几十个机关到鸣放得好的对外贸易部畜产公司去现场参观。这个公司在领导干部带领下，平均每人已经贴了二十六张大字报，有一个干部已经贴了一百三十五张大字报，质量都比较高。这个公司在反浪费反保守运动中充满了革命的精神，领导上每天布置战斗任务，要求所有工作人员利用业余时间，人人动脑动手，把反浪费反保守运动搞深搞透。
    在反浪费反保守运动中发扬了群众的智慧，鼓足了革命干劲，这就使大量惊人的浪费现象和一些严重的保守思想赤裸裸地暴露在群众面前，使人们普遍地受到一次最生动的勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的教育，启发了人们如何去挖掘那些无穷的潜力。轻工业部经过大鸣大放以后初步统计，第一个五年计划期间，在设计、基本建设、生产等方面的浪费有一亿元。石油工业部1957年仅全国钻井事故就损失一千七百多万元。邮电部在第一个五年计划期间，由于计划不周，设计、施工、物资供应等方面的管理不善，结果包工企业的窝工、停工、缺勤工日数，相当于全部实际工日数的6％，等于四百五十八人一年没有工作。产生这些浪费现象的原因，有些是由于经验不足，有些是由于领导干部的官僚主义、主观主义而产生的。干部们尖锐地批评了领导干部在这方面的缺点，希望他们在反浪费斗争中吸取教训。
    许多机关的情况证明，反浪费斗争已经大大地超出了它在经济上的意义，要通过反浪费，一箭射双雕，烧掉政治上和思想上的浪费现象，打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气。根据初步揭露，这方面的问题突出地表现在人力的浪费方面。由于有些机关有官气、暮气，劳动纪律松懈、缺勤率高的程度是相当惊人的。外文出版社长期以来暮气沉沉，仅1957年6月到11月的半年中，由于因私事请假、旷工、迟到等原因，总共缺勤二百四十一个月零四天，平均每月有四十一人不做工作。这个出版社有一个单位的部分摄影记者一年中窝工两个月到三个月。更严重的是有些工作人员在办公时间根本不做工作，而去做斗蟋蟀与填字谜一类的事情。在许多部门中，群众对官气、阔气、娇气进行了尖锐的批评。农业部有些司局一级的领导干部出差回来以前，专门打长途电话回来，要部里派汽车去接。群众批评说，真是娇气太浓了。农业部科学研究机关内有些研究工作人员娇气也很浓。如有些工作人员不亲自动手，连观察、记载、操作等基本过程也交给见习生去做，甚至交给没有经过训练的临时工作人员去做，结果是错误百出。群众讽刺这些研究人员是“贾宝玉”。有些科学研究部门在反浪费反保守运动中还提出要反掉名气，因为有些科学研究人员为了自己出名，一心为了考副博士，放弃了业务工作，给工作造成了很大的损失。
    许多单位提出，不反浪费不反保守便绝不能打掉官气和暮气，也就不能更好地鼓起革命干劲，来个生产大跃进。冶金工业部在实际斗争中提出反对浪费，勤俭建国；比先进，大跃进；反保守，扫暮气；反教条，讲实际；引火烧身，打掉官气、骄气；移风易俗，打掉阔气；兴无灭资，破个人主义；既算经济账，也算政治账；大整大改，做到多快好省等十二个口号，充实了反浪费反保守运动的内容。冶金工业部领导方面决心把反浪费反保守这一仗打到底，计划在1958年多为国家增加上亿元的利润。食品工业部在最近召开的全国盐务工作会议上结合讨论反浪费反保守运动中提出的问题，克服了保守思想，鼓起了干劲，决定依靠农业合作社将今年的建设规模由原八百万吨盐增加到一千二百到一千三百万吨盐，不要国家增加一个钱的投资。
    现在，有少数单位反浪费反保守的劲头不足，这些单位的领导干部还不认识在深入整改中进行反浪费的重大经济和政治意义，他们把深入整风运动看得很简单。如全国供销合作总社有一个单位对如何展开反浪费曾提出一个极为简单的计划：两天鸣放，两天辩论，两天整改。这样的计划显然是官样文章，不能收到什么成效。有些单位在作了动员以后，雷声大，雨点小，不见领导干部带头贴大字报，也不见领导干部深入下层发动群众，他们本身暮气沉沉，干劲不足，自然就不能使运动深入展开。
