　　How to Divide the Inheritance?
    In the past, there was a man with very strong feudal ideas and a bias toward sons. Unfortunately, he fell seriously ill and was on the verge of death. At this time, his wife was pregnant but had not yet given birth. He looked at his wife on his sickbed and, thinking about his condition, made a will regarding the inheritance issue. He said to his wife: If you give birth to a boy, then the boy will get two-thirds of my property, and you will get one-third; if you give birth to a girl, then you will get two-thirds of the property, and the girl will get one-third. After making the will, the man died soon after. Later, his wife gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl. The wife didn't know how to divide his inheritance in a way that wouldn't violate his will. So she went to consult a famous lawyer at the time. Do you know how this lawyer solved the problem?
    The answer will be in tomorrow's newspaper.

　　遗产怎么分？
    从前，有一个封建思想十分浓厚、重男轻女的人，不幸得了重病，奄奄一息，眼看就要死了。这时，他的妻子正怀有孕，尚未分娩。他在病床上看看他的妻子，又想想自己的病情，于是就关于遗产问题立了一个遗嘱，对妻子说：如果你生下的是男孩，那么，男孩得我的产业的三分之二，你自己得三分之一；如果你生下的是一个女孩，那么，你就得产业的三分之二，女孩得三分之一。立完遗嘱后，这个人不久就死了。后来，他的妻子竟一胎生了两个小孩，一男一女。妻子不知如何分配他的遗产，才不违背他的遗嘱。就跑去请教当时一个有名的律师。你知道这个律师是怎样解决这个问题的吗？
    答案见明日本报。
