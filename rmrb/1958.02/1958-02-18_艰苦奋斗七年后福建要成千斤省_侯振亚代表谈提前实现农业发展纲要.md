Fujian Province guarantees that the total grain output this year will reach over 10 billion jin, with an average yield of over 500 jin per mu; in 1962, it will reach 17.5 billion jin, with an average yield of 900 jin per mu, and in 1964 it will strive to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, becoming a "Thousand-Jin Province."

I fully support the reports made to the congress by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now, I will report to the congress on the issue of Fujian Province achieving the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule.

With the great victories achieved on all fronts across the country in 1957, the people of Fujian, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have achieved brilliant successes in the struggle to implement the First Five-Year Plan. In the agricultural front alone, the struggle between the two roads in rural politics and ideology has achieved a decisive victory. Production has increased, and agricultural cooperatives and the system of unified purchase and sale have been further consolidated. The relationship between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses, has become closer.

Achievements in 1957

The total income of farmers increased by more than 13% compared to 1956. Three "Thousand-Jin Counties" and four "Eight-Hundred-Jin Counties/Cities" emerged in the province.

On the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture in 1956, the total income of farmers in 1957 (including logging and rural handicrafts) reached 1.559 billion yuan, an increase of 13.46% compared to 1956. Pig raising increased by 38%, logging doubled, and many cash crops, animal husbandry, forestry, and fisheries also increased production. Grain production was slightly higher than the bumper harvest level of 1956. The work in 1957 was more comprehensive and solid. The province had three "Thousand-Jin Counties": Longxi, Haicheng, and Changle. Nan'an, Yunxiao, Fuzhou, and Zhangzhou (cities) had an average grain yield of over 800 jin per mu, achieving the requirements stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. According to the survey data of 10,000 agricultural cooperatives, it is estimated that about 30% of the cooperatives in the province have caught up with or exceeded the production level and income level of local well-to-do middle peasants, and in many counties in mountainous areas, more than 40% of the cooperatives have reached this level. In the past year's production, many high-yield records have also emerged, such as Fangting Agricultural Cooperative in Anxi County, which had a high-yield field with a rice yield of 2,173 jin per mu. There were more than 5,000 mu of "Thousand-Jin Rice Fields" in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian. Zhulian Agricultural Cooperative in Putian had a peanut yield record of 1,000 jin per mu. Hailiang Agricultural Cooperative in Fuqing created a jute yield record of 1,000 jin per mu. "Ten-Thousand-Jin Sweet Potatoes" have also been developed a lot. Some villages have created records of raising five, seven, or ten pigs per household. Due to the basic implementation of the class policy of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants, the vast majority of cooperatives are basically consolidated.

The victory of agricultural production in the past two years, especially the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1956, has enabled the over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan. Compared with 1952, grain production in 1957 increased by 19.43%, which is a great victory for the people of the province in building socialism.

Of course, the experience and lessons learned in rural work in the past year are extremely rich. We should earnestly draw lessons from them and effectively improve our work to usher in a high tide of production.

I. Fujian Province's Plan and Methods for Striving for a Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production

I. Achieving the National Agricultural Development Program Five Years Ahead of Schedule and the Tasks for 1958.

Since the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), leaders at all levels and the people of the province have launched enthusiastic study and discussions, unanimously expressing their support. The Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC proposed that the guiding principle of our country's economic construction is "to implement a policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry." This is completely correct. In order to firmly implement this policy, Fujian has decided to focus on the development of agriculture, realize the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, and enable the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives in the province to catch up with and exceed the production level and income level of local well-to-do middle peasants within two or three years. Strive to achieve the great task of realizing the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule. To this end, eight goals for agricultural development are proposed:

Eight Major Goals of Agricultural Development

(1) Agricultural production should continue to implement the policy of focusing on grain and comprehensively developing production. Grain production requirements: In 1958, the total output will reach more than 10 billion jin, an increase of 14.2% compared to 1957, and the average yield per mu in the province will reach more than 500 jin; in 1962, the total output will reach 17.5 billion jin, double the increase compared to 1957 (the total grain output of the province in 1957 was 8.75 billion jin). The average yield per mu will reach 900 jin, and in 1964, efforts will be made to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, realizing the "Thousand-Jin Province."

(2) Forestry production: Within five to seven years, afforestation and mountain closure for forest cultivation will reach 60 million mu, and more than half of the province's land area will become forest, completing greening. In 1962, logging will reach 5 million cubic meters, and the development of bamboo forests will reach 5 million mu; in 1958, afforestation will be 4 million mu, mountain closure for forest cultivation will be 8 million mu, 900,000 mu of bamboo forests will be reclaimed, 2.3 million mu of young forests will be nurtured, logging will be 3 million cubic meters, and 14 million bamboo poles will be felled. This is the second goal.

(3) Fishery production: In 1958, the task of 325,000 tons will be completed, an increase of 15%. In 1962, it will reach 550,000 tons, an increase of nearly 70% compared to 1957. This is the third goal.

(4) Oil production: Strive to achieve self-sufficiency in oil within three years starting from 1958. This is the fourth goal of agricultural production in our province. The main way to do this is to increase the unit area yield of existing peanuts and oil tea. The rapeseed yield should be increased from the current average of 20 jin of oil to more than 30 jin, and it is required to reclaim all the abandoned oil tea forests in 1958; the peanut yield should be increased from the current average of 140 jin per mu to more than 280 jin. With the addition of other oil production, the province's oil production can be increased from the current 480,000 dan to more than 1 million dan, and the oil-deficient province can be turned into an oil self-sufficient province. While increasing the unit area yield, it is also necessary to vigorously build new oil tea forests year by year. By 1962, it will reach 5 million mu. After seven to ten years, our province can become a province with surplus oil that can be exported.

(5) Animal husbandry and rural sideline and handicraft industries. Live pigs: In 1958, it will reach 5.68 million heads, with an average of more than two heads per household. In 1962, the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program will be completed more than doubled, reaching 12 million heads, with an average of four heads per household. Cattle: In 1958, it will reach 1.2 million heads, an increase of 20%. In 1962, it will reach 1.5 million heads, an increase of 50%. Sheep: In 1958, it will reach 550,000 heads. In 1962, it will reach 1.5 million heads, an increase of more than two times. Other rural handicraft industries, family sideline industries, such as raising chickens, ducks, rabbits, bees, silkworms, etc., should be actively developed. This is the fifth goal.

(6) Cash crops such as sugarcane, tea, fruits, hemp, tobacco, and subtropical crops such as agave, kapok, woody oil, and spice crops should be actively developed accordingly. This is the sixth goal.

(7) Carry out a large-scale patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, and strive to basically achieve a "Four-Without Province" within five years, eliminate schistosomiasis within two years, and eliminate local diseases that seriously endanger people's health in batches and phases. This is the seventh goal.

(8) Actively develop state-owned agricultural and forestry economies and expand public ownership. We have been lagging behind in this regard in recent years. The state-owned agricultural and forestry economy is both small and poor, especially in forestry, where most of the state-owned forests have not yet been managed. In the future, we must accelerate the development of state-owned agricultural and forestry economies. The development plan for 1958 must be guaranteed to be completed. This is the eighth goal.

Increase Yield per Unit Area

II. The main way to develop agricultural production is to increase the yield per unit area, which is of greater significance in our province where land is scarce and population is large. The large increase in production in 1956 was due to opposing right-leaning conservative ideas on the one hand and comprehensively promoting technical measures and advanced experiences to increase the yield per unit area on the other hand, such as water conservancy, fertilizer, reform, improved varieties, pest control, ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes, appropriate reclamation, and farming techniques. These measures should continue to be promoted in the future. The following is an explanation of the seven main measures:

(1) Water conservancy and fertilizer are two key issues in the development of agricultural production, and they are also two interrelated issues. Water and fertilizer are indispensable. We must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses to solve the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer. In terms of water conservancy construction, implement the policy of focusing on building small-scale water conservancy projects, combining large, medium, and small projects, and relying on cooperatives. Before and after the Spring Festival in 1958, complete the task of eliminating drought on 2 million mu, and strive to overfulfill 1 million mu within this year. Basically eliminate drought within two years. In mountainous areas, we should also vigorously promote the experience of changing flood irrigation to rotation irrigation and improving the bad mud fields. Complete the task of 1 million mu in 1958. At the same time, we should strengthen engineering management and irrigation technical guidance. In terms of accumulating fertilizer, in 1958, we must ensure that the amount of fertilizer applied is doubled compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied in the province reaches more than 1.5 billion dan. The accumulated fertilizer should reach about 1 billion dan before spring plowing. The most important method of accumulating fertilizer is to vigorously develop pig farming to accumulate fertilizer. This is a fertilizer accumulation method that is fast and guaranteed to be effective. It is required to enclose all live pigs and ensure that manure and urine are fertilized to the fields drop by drop. In addition to raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, our province also has a wide range of other fertilizer sources. We must also systematically promote the planting of green manure, and make full use of human manure, cattle manure, vigorously collect wild green manure, sea fertilizer, mud fertilizer, and accumulate miscellaneous fertilizer.

(2) Breed and protect farm cattle. Farm cattle are a long-term power in agricultural production. Even after agricultural mechanization, the power of cattle is still indispensable. We must pay great attention to the protection, management and breeding of farm cattle. Protect farm cattle to safely spend the winter, and strive not to freeze a cow to death. Cooperatives should be well managed, adhere to the system of "household feeding, combining breeding and use," promote the "five fixed" method, and require each cooperative to systematically achieve self-breeding and self-raising, and establish breeding bases. In addition to raising farm cattle in mountainous areas, we must also develop a large number of meat cattle.

(3) Continue to vigorously change the farming system in combination with rational crop rotation and expand the multiple cropping area. It is required to increase the multiple cropping area by 2.5 million mu in 1958. Adopt various methods according to local conditions, such as changing single-season rice to double-season rice, double-season rice to three-season rice, intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice, indica rice to japonica rice, one rice and one bean, one rice and one sweet potato, one rice and one bean and one wheat. In areas with suitable conditions, change one season to two seasons, and two seasons to three seasons.

(4) Promote improved seeds. The area of improved seeds that have been promoted effectively should be actively expanded, and attention should be paid to replanting some improved seeds that have been promoted for a long time. Agricultural technology departments should actively collect local excellent varieties, appraise and promote them. All cooperatives should cultivate sufficient seed retention fields, breed improved seeds, and rejuvenate improved seeds.

(5) Vigorously eliminate diseases and insect pests, implement the State Council's Provisional Measures for Plant Quarantine, and prevent the spread of diseases and insect pests. Vigorously promote the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, implement the principle of prevention is more important than treatment, and actively study radical treatment methods for diseases and insect pests that cannot be eradicated at present.

(6) Improve the soil and turn low-yield fields into high-yield fields. There are still 5 to 6 million mu of mountain ridges, iron rust fields, sandy soil fields, acidic soil fields, etc. in the province with a yield of less than 200 jin per mu. If we use the method of adding soil from elsewhere or applying more organic fertilizer to improve the soil, it is relatively easy to increase the yield by one or two times. This is a measure that achieves twice the result with half the effort, and should be promoted urgently.

(7) From now on, we must pay attention to studying and solving the problem of agricultural (forestry) mechanization, develop small-scale hydropower stations in mountainous areas, and pay attention to cultivating technical personnel in this area. Determined to promote double-wheel double-share plows, check the shortcomings of the past promotion of double-wheel double-share plows, adopt the method of personal experimentation, typical demonstration, and visiting performances, and use facts to convince the masses and help them master the technology; the selection and training of agricultural tool technicians should be carried out correctly and seriously, and the management of cooperatives should also keep up.

Comprehensively Develop the Mountainous Economy

III. Comprehensively develop the mountainous economy. Our province is basically a mountainous area, with great production potential and many production avenues. It is indeed a "green treasury" with infinite wealth. In recent years, the development and changes in the mountainous economy have been great, and it is no longer so backward. As long as we show revolutionary spirit and work hard, the development of the mountainous economy can surpass the coastal areas.

The key to socialist construction in our province lies in developing and developing the mountainous economy. The guiding principle for developing mountainous production is to comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and local specialties and minerals on the premise of doing a good job in soil and water conservation and giving priority to the development of grain and oil. To develop the mountainous economy, attention should be paid to solving the following four problems:

(1) The forestry problem. Forestry production occupies a very important position in mountainous production in addition to agriculture. To ensure the completion of forestry development tasks:

1.  Implement comprehensive management and give full play to the experience of "supporting long-term projects with short-term ones" among the masses. Implement intercropping of forest land to combine long-term interests with immediate interests.
2.  Afforestation should also implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. It must be built well and fast. The methods of afforestation should be adapted to local conditions and cannot be the same. For example, there are methods such as seedling planting, cutting, and sprouting renewal for planting fir trees. One should pay attention to not destroying the forest or wasting timber when logging; second, pay attention to not destroying soil and water conservation; third, construct as you cut and construct two mu for every mu cut. The logging and afforestation agencies should be completely merged to facilitate comprehensive planning for logging and afforestation and avoid the problem of only managing logging and not managing afforestation.
3.  Protect the forest. The destruction of forests and mountain burning has not been completely stopped. Practical forest fire prevention covenants and regulations should be stipulated according to the forest fire prevention experience of various places and strictly implemented.
4.  The issue of forest rights and the incorporation of forest trees into cooperatives must be resolved before spring plowing. Landlords and rich peasants who were omitted during the land reform should be dealt with. Unowned forests and natural forests should be nationalized. The issue of handling forest rights should be resolved at the same time as the issue of handling mountain forest incorporation into cooperatives.

(2) The issue of labor force in mountainous areas. The so-called labor force in mountainous areas is not in comparison with the coast. At present, an important aspect of solving this problem is to improve the labor organization and production management methods in mountainous areas. We should vigorously promote the experience of organizing mountain farming teams. The labor potential of women in mountainous areas is still great and needs to be further mobilized; the labor force in mountainous areas should be conserved and used rationally, so that men, women, old, young, full labor and half labor can all undertake appropriate production labor, like the Jianfeng Cooperative in Shunchang County, so that every household has no idlers. In this way, the problem of labor force in mountainous areas can be basically solved. In addition, coastal labor should be organized to migrate to the mountains in a planned way. The grain supplied to those who should stay in the countryside should not be transported back and forth in a centralized manner to save labor in the mountainous areas.

(3) The issue of processing industry going up the mountains. The processing industry of agricultural, forestry, and sideline products or handicrafts with raw materials in mountainous areas should go up the mountains instead of being concentrated in cities. This can not only develop industry and handicrafts, but also save transportation capacity, reduce costs, and also solve some fertilizer and feed for agricultural use.

(4) The issue of transportation in mountainous areas. During the Second Five-Year Plan, transportation should meet the needs of developing mountainous resources. The solution is to rely on cooperatives and the masses to build and improve simple roads, roads, mountain roads, and waterways in mountainous areas, in addition to national support for building trunk roads in mountainous areas.

In order to develop and develop the mountainous areas, we must advocate that cadres go to the mountains, work go to the mountains, meetings go to the mountains, culture, education, and health go to the mountains, and commerce, industry, handicrafts, enterprises, and careers go to the mountains. This should be a direction for the future.

Implement Rectification and Conscientiously Rectify Cooperatives

IV. Implement rural rectification and conscientiously carry out cooperative rectification. It is required to change the backward state of all three types of cooperatives (teams) before spring plowing. We must closely integrate with the production upsurge, set off a rectification upsurge, and conscientiously carry out cooperative rectification.

The basic requirements for cooperative rectification are:

(1) Resolutely implement the class line, maintain the advantage of the original poor peasants and lower-middle peasants (mainly the current poor peasants and lower-middle peasants in the new middle peasants) in the leadership composition of the cooperative, and at the same time pay attention to making the upper-middle peasants also have appropriate representatives.

(2) The cadres of the cooperative should take a step forward in ideological style through this cooperative rectification and learn the working methods of the mass line. After the rectification, implement democratic elections and improve the democratic system of the party member representative meeting. During this cadre devolution and the withdrawal of districts and merging of townships, more than 10,000 cadres should be transferred to serve as cooperative directors and branch secretaries to strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level.

(3) Agricultural (fishery) cooperatives should actively expand public accumulation. When we first cooperated, it was correct to adopt the method of "deducting less and distributing more." Now about 30% of the cooperatives in the province have caught up with the production level and income level of well-to-do middle peasants. This year, it is possible that more than 50% or 60% of the cooperatives will reach this level. Therefore, we should no longer emphasize "deducting less and distributing more," and should expand public accumulation as much as possible under the conditions that the income of cooperative members is increased. Expanding the public accumulation of the cooperative, expanding reproduction, and expanding basic construction will make the production cooperative more consolidated and production can leap forward greatly.

(4) Conscientiously do a good job in the autumn harvest distribution and manage the finances of the cooperative. Public financial disclosure should be further improved to ensure clear accounts. Reliable political elements among the devolved cadres and students in the countryside should be absorbed to solve the accounting problems of the cooperative.

(5) Implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and managing households diligently and thriftily. Oppose waste, practice thrift, and strive for simplicity in weddings, funerals, celebrations, and festivals. Each township and cooperative should formulate a gambling ban plan and strictly enforce the ban. The customs of doing Buddhist birthdays and "Pudu" in southern Fujian should be reformed. People who do not work and idle around should be handed over to production cooperatives for reform. In short, we must change the social atmosphere in all aspects. II. How to Achieve the Main Indicators of the Forty Articles Five Years Ahead of Schedule

In order to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule, we must continue to thoroughly implement the rectification movement advocated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carry out rectification severely, thoroughly change our style, eliminate officialdom, overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, and earnestly implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily. While focusing on the development of agriculture, we must actively and vigorously develop industry, change the backward face of industry in our province, and the output value of local industry will exceed the output value of agriculture within five years. Develop commerce, transportation, culture, education, health, and various production and construction undertakings, and actively cooperate with and support the great leap forward in agricultural production. We must take corresponding active measures in the organization. Fujian Province has decided to transfer 50 cadres above the level of director and deputy director (including provincial party committee secretaries, ministers and deputy ministers, and deputy governors), 300 directors and cadres of equivalent director level, and more than 1,000 county-level cadres to mainly strengthen the leadership at the county level, and strengthen the leadership of factories, farms, forest farms, and grassroots units in the cultural and educational front. 15,000 cadres, at least 10,000 cadres with good composition, active work, ability to contact the masses, and certain knowledge and experience in rural production work, should be transferred to strengthen the leadership of agricultural cooperatives and other grassroots work; in addition, 70,000 cadres will be devolved from the 160,000 administrative management cadres in the province to go to the mountains and the countryside to participate in agricultural, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry and other labor production, adding a group of culturally and technically proficient new forces to the labor front. The above-mentioned cadres are being devolved one after another, and all of them will be devolved before spring plowing. This will basically make organizational preparations for the great leap forward in agricultural production and other various production and construction. In addition, we must resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on "more, faster, better, and more economical," continue to oppose right-leaning conservative ideas, "boost our energy, strive for the upper reaches," "work hard for three years," and strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule.

    艰苦奋斗七年后福建要成千斤省
    侯振亚代表谈提前实现农业发展纲要
    福建省保证今年粮食总产量达到一百亿斤以上，平均亩产五百斤以上；1962年达到一百七十五亿斤，平均亩产量达到九百斤，1964年争取达到平均亩产一千斤，实现千斤省。
    我完全拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告，现在我就福建省提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要问题，向大会作如下汇报。
    随着一九五七年全国在各个战线上的伟大胜利，福建人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在执行第一个五年计划的斗争中，获得了辉煌的成就，单就农业战线上讲，农村政治、思想上的两条道路的斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利。生产增加了，农业合作社和统购统销制度进一步巩固了。党与群众的关系、干部与群众的关系进一步密切了。
    一九五七年的成就
    农民总收入比1956年提高13％以上。全省出现了三个千斤县，四个八百斤的县、市。
    在一九五六年农业大跃进的基础上一九五七年农民总收入（包括伐木和农村手工业等）达到十五亿五千九百万元，比一九五六年增长百分之十三点四六。养猪增加了百分之三十八，伐木增加一倍，许多经济作物、畜牧、林业、渔业等均有增产，粮食略高于一九五六年大丰收的水平。一九五七年的工作更全面踏实一些。全省有龙溪、海澄、长乐三个千斤县，南安、云霄、福州、漳州等四个县（市），每亩平均粮食达到八百斤以上，提前实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的要求。根据一万个农业社的调查材料估计，全省约有百分之三十左右的社已经赶上或超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平，山区有不少的县百分之四十以上的社达到这个水平。一年来的生产中，也出现了许多高额丰产纪录，如安溪县芳亭农业社有亩产稻谷二千一百七十三斤的丰产田，闽北山区有五千多亩千斤稻田，莆田的珠联农业社花生亩产一千斤的纪录，福清的海亮农业社创造了黄麻亩产一千斤的纪录，“万斤薯”也发展了很多。部分乡创造了每户养猪五头、七头、十头的纪录。由于基本上贯彻了依靠贫农、团结中农的阶级政策，绝大多数社基本上是巩固的。
    两年来农业生产的胜利，特别是一九五六年的农业生产大跃进，使第一个五年计划超额的完成了，一九五七年粮食产量和一九五二年相比，增长百分之十九点四三，这是全省人民建设社会主义的伟大胜利。
    当然，农村工作中一年来的经验教训是极其丰富的，我们应该认真从中吸取经验教训，切实改进我们的工作，掀起生产的高潮。
    一、福建省争取农业生产大跃进的计划和办法
    一、提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要和一九五八年的任务。
    自全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布后，全省各级领导和全省人民展开了热烈的学习和讨论，一致表示拥护。中共八届三中全会提出，我国经济建设方针，是“在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针”。这是完全正确的，为了坚定地贯彻执行这一方针，福建决定以发展农业为重点，实现农业生产不断地跃进，使全省绝大多数农业生产合作社在二、三年内赶上和超过当地富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平。争取提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要的伟大任务。为此，提出农业发展的八个奋斗目标：
    农业发展八大目标
    （1）农业生产要继续贯彻以粮食为主全面发展生产的方针。粮食生产要求：一九五八年总产量达到一百亿斤以上，比一九五七年增产百分之十四点二，全省平均亩产量达到五百斤以上；一九六二年总产量达到一百七十五亿斤，比一九五七年增产一倍（一九五七年全省粮食总产量八十七亿五千万斤）。平均亩产量达到九百斤，一九六四年争取平均亩产量一千斤，实现“千斤省”。
    （2）林业生产，在五年至七年内，造林、封山育林六千万亩，全省土地面积的半数以上成为森林，完成绿化。一九六二年伐木达到五百万立方公尺，发展竹林达到五百万亩；一九五八年造林四百万亩，封山育林八百万亩，垦复竹林九十万亩，抚育幼林二百三十万亩，伐木三百万立方公尺，伐竹一千四百万根。这是第二个奋斗目标。
    （3）渔业生产：一九五八年完成三十二万五千吨的任务，增产百分之十五。一九六二年达到五十五万吨，比一九五七年增产近百分之七十。这是第三个奋斗目标。
    （4）油料生产：争取从一九五八年起三年内做到油料自给，这是我省农业生产的第四个目标。主要是提高现有花生和油茶的单位面积产量。油菜从现有平均产油二十斤提高到三十斤以上，并要求在一九五八年内把荒芜的油茶林全部垦复起来；花生从现在平均每亩产量一百四十斤提高到二百八十斤以上，加上其他一些油脂生产，全省油料产量就可以从现在的四十八万担增加到一百万担以上，缺油省就可以变为油料自给省。在提高单位面积产量的同时，还必须逐年地大力营造新的油茶林，到一九六二年达到五百万亩，七年至十年以后，我省就可以变成油脂有余的能够输出的省。
    （5）畜牧和农村副业、手工业。生猪：一九五八年达到五百六十八万头，每户平均两头以上，在一九六二年超一倍完成全国农业发展纲要的要求，达到一千二百万头，每户平均四头。牛：一九五八年达到一百二十万头，增长百分之二十，一九六二年，达到一百五十万头，增长百分之五十。羊：一九五八年达到五十五万头，一九六二年达到一百五十万头，增长二倍多。其他农村手工业、家庭副业、养鸡、养鸭、养兔、养蜂、养蚕等均应积极地发展。这是第五个奋斗目标。
    （6）技术作物如甘蔗、茶叶、果产、麻类、烟叶以及亚热带作物如龙舌兰、木棉、木本油料、香料作物等，均应积极地相适应地发展。这是第六个奋斗目标。
    （7）开展大规模的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，争取五年内基本实现“四无省”，两年内消灭血吸虫病，并分批分期消灭严重危害人民健康的地方病。这是第七个奋斗目标。
    （8）积极地发展农业、林业国营经济，扩大全民所有制。我们几年来在这方面是落后的，国营的农、林业经济是既少又差，特别是林业方面，大部分国有林都还没有管起来。今后必须加速发展农、林业国营的经济，一九五八年的发展计划，必须保证完成。这是第八个奋斗目标。
    提高单位面积产量
    二、发展农业生产的道路主要是提高单位面积产量，这在我省地少人多的情况下有更重要的意义。一九五六年的大增产就是一方面反对了右倾保守思想，一方面全面地推广了提高单位面积产量的技术措施和先进经验，如水利、肥料、改制、良种、治虫、万斤薯、适当开荒以及耕作技术等，这些措施今后仍应继续推行。下面就七个主要措施分别说明：
    （1）水利和肥料是发展农业生产两个关键性的问题，也是两个相互关联的问题，水、肥缺一不可。我们必须依靠群众，发动群众来解决水利和肥料问题。在水利建设方面，贯彻兴修小型水利为主，大、中、小结合，社办为主的方针。在一九五八年春节前后，完成消灭旱灾二百万亩的任务，并在今年内争取超额完成一百万亩。在两年内基本消灭旱灾。山区还应大力推广变患灌为轮灌，及改良烂泥田的经验，在一九五八年完成一百万亩的任务，同时应加强工程管理和灌溉技术指导工作。在积肥方面，一九五八年要保证做到施肥量比去年增加一倍，全省施肥量达到十五亿担以上，在春耕前积肥应达到十亿担左右。积肥的方法，最主要的是大力发展圈猪积肥，这是一种收效快、有保证的积肥办法。要求把全部生猪圈起来，做到粪尿点滴肥田。除了养猪积肥外，我省其他肥源也是很广的。必须同时有计划的推广种植绿肥，并充分利用人粪尿、牛肥，大力采集野生绿肥、海肥、泥肥、堆积杂肥等。
    （2）繁殖与保护耕牛。耕牛是农业生产上长时期的动力，即使农业机械化以后，牛力仍然是不可减少的。必须十分重视耕牛的保护管理和繁殖。要保护耕牛安全过冬，力争不冻死一头牛。要把合作社饲养管理得好，坚持“分户喂养，养用合一”的制度，推广“五定”办法，并要求每一个合作社有计划地做到自繁自养，建立饲养基地，在山区除了饲养耕牛外，还要大量发展菜牛。
    （3）继续结合合理轮种大力改变耕作制度，扩大复种面积。要求一九五八年增加二百五十万亩的复种面积。因地制宜地分别采取单季稻改双季稻、双季稻改三季稻、间作稻改连作稻、籼稻改粳稻、一稻一豆、一稻一地瓜、一稻一豆一麦等多种办法，在有条件的地区，使一季改为两季，两季改为三季。
    （4）推广优良种子。对已经推广有成效的良种应积极扩大面积，对一些推广已久的良种要注意复种。农业技术部门应积极采集本地优良品种，鉴定推广。所有的合作社均应培植足够的留种田，繁殖良种，复壮良种。
    （5）大力消灭病虫害，执行国务院植物检疫试行办法，防止病虫害蔓延。大力推广防治病虫害药械，贯彻防重于治的方针，对目前尚无法根治的病虫害，应积极研究根治办法。
    （6）改良土壤，变低产田为高产田。全省山垅田、铁锈田、沙土田、酸性土壤田等，亩产量二百斤以下的，尚有五、六百万亩，如果我们用客土法或者多施有机肥等办法去改良土壤，使产量增加一倍或两倍是比较容易的，这是一个事半功倍的措施，应该抓紧推行。
    （7）从现在起，就必须注意研究和解决农（林）业机械化问题，发展山区小型水电站，并注意培养这一方面的技术力量。决心推广双轮双铧犁，检查过去推广双轮双铧犁的缺点，采取亲自试验，典型示范，参观表演，用事实说服群众的方法，帮助群众掌握技术；对于农具手要进行正确的选择和认真的训练，合作社的经营管理也要跟上去。
    全面发展山区经济
    三、全面发展山区经济。我省基本是一个山区，生产潜力很大，生产门路很多，确是一个“绿色金库”，财富无穷。几年来山区经济的发展变化很大，已不是那样落后了。只要我们拿出革命精神，鼓足劲头来干，山区经济的发展是能够超过沿海的。
    我省社会主义建设的关键在于开发和发展山区经济。发展山区生产的方针，是在做好水土保持，优先发展粮食、油料的条件下，全面地发展农业、林业、牧业和土特产、矿产等多种经济。发展山区经济，应注意解决以下四个问题：
    （1）林业问题。山区生产除农业外，林业生产占很重要的位置。为保证完成林业发展任务：
    1．要实行综合经营，充分地发扬群众中“以短养长”的经验。实行林地间种，使长远的利益和眼前的利益结合起来。
    2．造林也要贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，要造得好，还要速度快，造林的方法，应该因地制宜，不能千篇一律。如栽杉木有实生苗、插条、萌芽更新等办法。伐木一要注意不破坏森林，不浪费木材；二要注意不破坏水土保持，三要随伐随造，伐一亩造两亩。造林与伐木的机构，要彻底合并，便于伐木和造林全面规划和避免只管伐木不管造林的毛病。
    3．保护森林。森林的破坏和烧山还未完全制止。应根据各地的护林防火经验，规定出切实可行的护林防火公约和条例，并严格地执行。
    4．林权和林木入社问题，在春耕以前必须加以解决。土改时，漏划的地主、富农要加以处理，无主林和天然林应归国有，处理林权问题应该和处理山林入社问题同时解决。
    （2）山区劳动力问题。所谓山区劳动力不是和沿海比较而言的。目前解决这一问题很重要的一面是要改善山区劳动力组织和生产管理方法。要大力推广组织耕山队的经验，山区妇女劳动潜力还很大，需要继续发动；对山区劳力要节约和合理使用，使山区男、女、老、少，全劳动力和半劳动力都能担任适当的生产劳动，像顺昌县建锋社那样，做到家家户户无闲人。这样，山区劳动力的问题就基本上可以解决。此外，还要有计划地组织沿海劳动力移民上山。应该留乡的供应粮不要集中往返运输，以节省山区的劳动力。
    （3）加工业上山问题。农、林、副产品的加工业或者原料在山区的手工业，均应上山，而不应该集中到城市，这样做，既可以发展工业、手工业，又可以节省运输力，降低费用，还可以解决一部分农业用的肥料和饲料。
    （4）山区交通问题。在第二个五年计划期间，交通运输应该是适应开发山区富源的需要。解决的办法，除了国家支持修建山区公路干线以外，主要是依靠合作社，依靠群众，修建和改善山区简易公路、大路、山路及河道。
    为了开发和发展山区，我们要提倡干部上山，工作上山，会议上山，文教卫生上山，商业、工业、手工业、企业、事业上山。这应该作为今后的一个方向。
    贯彻整风认真整社
    四、贯彻农村整风，认真进行整社。要求在春耕以前改变所有三类社（队）的落后状态。必须紧密结合生产高潮，掀起整改高潮，认真地进行整社。
    整社的基本要求是：
    （1）坚决贯彻阶级路线，在社的领导成份中保持原来的贫农和下中农（主要是现在的贫农和新中农中间的下中农）的优势，同时注意使上中农亦有适当的代表。
    （2）合作社的干部，应该通过这次整社从思想作风上提高一步，学会群众路线的工作方法。经过整改以后，实行民主选举，健全党员代表会议的民主制度。在这次干部下放和撤区并乡时应该抽调一万个以上干部去当社长，当支部书记，加强基层的领导。
    （3）农（渔）业社应该积极地扩大公共积累。我们在合作化第一年的时候，采取“少扣多分”的办法，是正确的。现在全省已有百分之三十左右的社赶上了富裕中农的生产水平和收入水平，今年可能有百分之五十或六十以上的社达到这个水平，因此，不应该再强调“少扣多分”，应该在社员收入有所增加的条件下，尽可能扩大公共积累。扩大社的公共积累，扩大再生产，扩大基本建设，生产合作社才能更加巩固，生产才能大跃进。
    （4）认真地做好秋收分配工作，搞好社的财务管理。应由去年的财政公开进一步做到账目清楚。应吸收下放干部和在乡学生中的政治可靠分子解决社的会计问题。
    （5）贯彻勤俭办社，勤俭持家的方针。反对浪费，厉行节约，婚丧喜庆，过年过节，力求从简。各乡、社应订出禁赌计划，厉行禁赌。闽南地区做佛诞和“普度”的风俗，应进行改革。对不事劳动、游手好闲的人，应交给生产合作社进行改造。总之，要从各方面来改变社会风气。二、怎样提前五年实现四十条的主要指标
    为了提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要，必须继续深入贯彻党中央和毛主席倡导的整风运动，狠狠地进行整改，彻底转变我们的作风，打掉官气，克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，切实贯彻勤俭建国的方针。必须以发展农业为重点的同时，积极地大力发展工业，改变我省工业的落后面貌，地方工业产值在五年之内超过农业产值，发展商业、交通运输业、文教卫生事业及各项生产建设事业，积极配合与支援农业生产大跃进。必须在组织上采取相应的积极措施，福建省决定，抽调五十名厅、局长以上干部（包括省委书记、正副部长、副省长在内），三百名处长及相当处长级的干部，一千余名县级干部，主要加强县级领导，并加强工厂、农场、林场及文教战线等基层单位的领导，抽调一万五千名，至少一万名成份好、工作积极、能联系群众、有一定农村生产工作知识和经验的干部，加强农业合作社的领导，及其他基层工作；此外，并从全省十六万名行政管理干部中下放干部七万名，上山下乡，参加农、林、渔、牧及其他劳动生产，为劳动战线增加一批有文化、有技术的生力军。上述这些干部正在陆续下放，至春耕前一律下放完毕，这样将为农业生产及其他各种生产建设的大跃进基本上做好了组织准备。此外，还必须坚决执行党中央和毛主席关于“多、快、好、省”的指示，继续不断地反对右倾保守思想，“鼓起干劲，力争上游”，“苦干三年”，为提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。
