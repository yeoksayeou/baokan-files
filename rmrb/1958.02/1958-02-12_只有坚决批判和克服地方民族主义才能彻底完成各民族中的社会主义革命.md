Comrade Mamutniyazi revealed in his speech the conspiracy activities of local nationalists in Xinjiang to split the unification of the motherland, exclude the Han people, and oppose the leadership of the Party. He believes that opposing bourgeois nationalist ideology is an important component of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Only by resolutely criticizing and overcoming local nationalist ideology can we further consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, thoroughly complete the socialist revolution among all nationalities, and smoothly develop socialist construction among all nationalities.
I fully agree with and endorse the reports made to the conference by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

I am a cadre of a minority nationality and would like to talk about the issue of opposing local nationalism at this conference.

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have achieved great successes in all aspects. In a short period of eight years, we have not only completed the democratic reforms but also basically realized the socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production. Industrial, agricultural (pastoral) production has greatly developed, people's lives have been significantly improved, the historical system of national oppression has long been abolished, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and more than ten autonomous prefectures and counties of other ethnic groups have been established. People of all ethnic groups have realized the right to be masters of their own affairs in national life. All of this has enabled our Party to establish a fairly solid foundation among the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Now our Party is leading the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to leap forward courageously on the road of socialism. However, the reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes are not reconciled to their demise and are still trying every possible means to attack the Party. They believe that the Party's proposal for "correctly handling contradictions among the people" and the rectification movement are good opportunities for them to attack the Party, so they are fanning the flames everywhere and putting forward their reactionary demands. Many of them specialize in stirring up trouble and carrying out sabotage on national issues. They use "nationality" as a cover, appear as "representatives of national interests," and use various beautiful phrases such as "safeguarding national interests," "loving the nation," "national feelings," and "national honor" to disguise themselves and deceive the masses. In reality, they are scum among the minority nationalities, thorough bourgeois local nationalists, and enemies of socialism.

What do these local nationalists want to do in Xinjiang?

One, they first attempt to split Xinjiang from the great family of the motherland. They believe that implementing the policy of national regional autonomy and establishing autonomous areas cannot solve the national problems in Xinjiang. They demand separation and the establishment of "Uyghuristan" or the "Uyghur Republic." They regard today's regional autonomy as a preparatory stage for establishing a republic tomorrow. They oppose the name "Xinjiang," saying that "Xinjiang" is a new colony. They demand the establishment of federated republics or autonomous republics in China. In fact, they use this as a guise. What they want is "independence," the independence of a bourgeois republic, and dependence on imperialism. Our country's situation determines that we should realize the unification of the motherland by establishing autonomous areas rather than adopting a federal system. The population of minority nationalities in our country accounts for only six percent of the total population, and their distribution is mostly intertwined. Taking Xinjiang as an example, although the proportion of minority nationalities is relatively large, there are more than ten other minority nationalities besides the Uyghur nationality. At the same time, because of the long-term economic ties and cultural exchanges between the various nationalities in our country, especially in the past thirty years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a close and inseparable whole has been formed in the common struggle. Historical development has formed the economic and political foundation for the various minority nationalities to implement regional autonomy and establish localities within the great family of the motherland, and no conditions for establishing a federal system have been formed. Therefore, it is completely correct and necessary for our country not to adopt a federal system but to adopt a unitary state system as the basic policy for solving the national problems in our country. The experience of promoting the policy of national regional autonomy in Xinjiang has fully proved that the national autonomous regions are indeed the best form for solving the national problems in the Xinjiang region and have been enthusiastically supported and wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses of minority nationalities. The reason why the bourgeois local nationalists frantically attack the Party's national policy and put forward proposals such as "republics" is precisely to show their wolfish ambition to split the unification of the motherland and the Party, undermine the proletarian dictatorship, and undermine the socialist cooperation between the various nationalities. In order to realize their sinister conspiracy, they also groundlessly insist that Xinjiang was once an "independent" country. In fact, Xinjiang has always been a part of China. Their actions are just futile self-deception. The local nationalist elements who are making trouble for independence say that Xinjiang has a vast territory and abundant underground resources. Why didn't our ancestors who lived on this land for a long time achieve the achievements made under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Han people in the past eight years since liberation? Without the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, without sufficient funds, labor, and modern scientific and technological knowledge, it is impossible to turn underground resources into the wealth of the people. Without the mutual assistance and cooperation of the people of all nationalities in the great family of the motherland, it is impossible for a nation to build a prosperous socialist society alone.

Two, the bourgeois nationalists in Xinjiang, on the pretext that the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region should have national characteristics and on the pretext of realizing autonomous rights and nationalization, exclude Han cadres and oppose Han people going to Xinjiang. Everyone knows that in recent years, the work in all aspects of Xinjiang has achieved great results with the help of Han cadres and Han people and the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. People of all ethnic groups are endlessly grateful and praised the help of Han cadres and Han people, but bourgeois nationalists oppose Han cadres and Han people. They clamor that "the organs are Hanified, not nationalized." They increase the number of minority nationality cadres in autonomous organs whenever they have the opportunity, regardless of the situation and conditions, seriously violating the cadre policy of the Party and the state. They try their best to absorb and introduce people who sing the same tune as them to participate in the work. They absorb them as cadres and give them important positions regardless of whether they are class alien elements or counter-revolutionary elements, as long as they are of their own nationality. They are proud of the increase in the percentage of national cadres in the organs. They attempt to remove Han cadres from their posts without reason. In order to achieve their goals, they do not hesitate to deny the advantages of Han cadres, exaggerate their shortcomings, and even fabricate facts to attack Han cadres. If someone explains to them the importance of unity and cooperation among all nationalities, they will say, "There should be national feelings to love one's own nationality," and believe that only by holding such an attitude towards Han cadres can the role of national cadres be brought into play, which in practice is to exclude Han cadres. Some Uyghur nationalists often shout "My Uyghur," "The interests of the nation," etc., not only excluding the Han nationality, but also excluding other minority nationalities who have lived in Xinjiang for a long time and have similar religious beliefs and living habits, languages, and scripts, thinking that they are not as progressive as the Uyghur nationality, and opposing the cadres of other minority nationalities other than the Uyghur nationality from holding leadership positions in the Party and state organs. They often talk behind their backs. In their view, everything of their own nationality is good, and everything of other nationalities is not good. Even the bad things of their own nationality are good, and the good things of other nationalities are not good. They proudly say that the literature and art of the Uyghur nationality are superior to any other nationality. They call themselves "protectors of national interests" and "lovers of their own nation." In fact, they have become great nationalists to other minority nationalities in the autonomous region. They are fierce enemies who betray national interests, lead the nation away from their great motherland and other fraternal nations to the road of poverty and bankruptcy. Judging from the materials of some bourgeois local nationalists exposed in Xinjiang, what they love is not the working people of their own nationality, but a small group of feudal landlords, bourgeoisies, and other reactionary elements within their own nationality.

Three, they oppose the leadership of the Party and undermine the unity and solidarity of the Party. They know that the Communist Party is the decisive condition for leading the people of all ethnic groups to eliminate the exploitation system and establish the socialist system. In order to restore capitalism and other exploitation systems, they will inevitably try every means to attack the leadership of the Party. They slanderously say that "the leadership of the Party is the rule of great Han chauvinism," and "without the leadership of the Party, minority nationalities can also achieve liberation and build socialism on their own." They also viciously attack and insult the Party members of their own nationality, especially the Party members who are responsible for leadership. They insult the minority nationality leading cadres who stand on the Party's position as "being bought by the Han nationality" and "unable to represent national interests." In particular, they adopt the means of splitting the Party to achieve the goal of abolishing the Party. They say that Party members of other nationalities cannot seek happiness for their own nationality, and only Party members of their own nationality and the Party organizations composed of Party members of their own nationality can seek happiness for their own nationality. Therefore, they try their best to exclude Han Party members and cadres working in Xinjiang, especially Han Party members and cadres who hold leadership positions. Obviously, their purpose is to fundamentally eliminate the leadership of the Party. The Communist Party of China is the political party of the Chinese working class. Its purpose is to realize socialism and communism in China. It is the savior of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The Party organization is established based on the unity and solidarity of the proletariat and the principles of communism. There should be no sectarian or national boundaries within the Party. Therefore, the view of attempting to split the Party organization and build the Party according to national components is extremely reactionary and contrary to the principles of internationalism.

In addition to the above three aspects, local nationalism in Xinjiang is also manifested in many other aspects. Although the number of local nationalists is not large, their harm is quite great because they are wearing the cloak of nationality and appearing as "defenders of national interests," so they can still confuse and deceive some of the masses in a certain period of time. Especially in the case that many minority nationality cadres and intellectuals still have different degrees of local nationalist ideological tendencies, and the national estrangement left over from history has not been completely eliminated, the disguised reactionary activities of local nationalists are more likely to have an impact. Therefore, we must, in this nationwide rectification movement, thoroughly criticize local nationalist ideology among minority nationalities in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, and resolutely smash the conspiracy activities of local nationalists. Local nationalism is a bourgeois reactionary ideology. Opposing bourgeois nationalist ideology is an important component of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Only by resolutely criticizing and overcoming local nationalist ideology can we further consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, thoroughly complete the socialist revolution among all nationalities in our country, and smoothly develop the socialist construction cause of all nationalities in our country.

Cadres and people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang resolutely support the criticism of local nationalism. Since the second half of last year, cadres of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have generally studied Premier Zhou's and Vice Premier Ulanhu's speeches at the Qingdao National Work Symposium, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report at the Third Plenary Session, and Comrade Saifudin's report at the enlarged meeting of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee on December 16 last year. Through the study of these documents and reports, the political and ideological consciousness of cadres of all ethnic groups has been greatly improved. They have expressed their firm support for the instructions of the Central Committee and will carry out the struggle to criticize local nationalism to the end, and will never stop until complete victory is achieved.

Recently, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Party Committee is holding an enlarged meeting to criticize local nationalism. We believe that after this rectification movement, and after criticizing local nationalist ideology, the socialist consciousness of minority nationality cadres and the masses will be greatly improved, the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities will be further consolidated, so as to bring the socialist revolution and construction cause of our country to a new climax. At present, Xinjiang, like other parts of the country, has also seen a large-scale production leap forward. Let us, the people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, ride the wind and waves and forge ahead courageously.

Please criticize and correct any inappropriateness in the above speech.

    只有坚决批判和克服地方民族主义才能彻底完成各民族中的社会主义革命
    马木提尼牙孜代表在发言中揭露了地方民族主义者在新疆分裂祖国统一，排斥汉族人民以及反对党的领导的阴谋活动。他认为反对资产阶级民族主义思想是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的一个重要组成部分，只有坚决批判和克服地方民族主义思想才能进一步巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，才能彻底完成各民族中的社会主义革命，才能顺利发展各民族中的社会主义建设。
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的各项报告。
    我是一个少数民族干部，想在这次大会上谈一谈关于反对地方民族主义的问题。
    解放以来，新疆各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导之下，在各方面都获得了伟大的成绩。在短短八年的时间里，不仅完成了民主改革，而且基本上实现了在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，工、农（牧）业生产都有了很大的发展，人民生活已经得到显著改善，历史上的民族压迫制度早已废除，并且建立了新疆维吾尔自治区和十多个其他民族的自治州和自治县，各民族人民在国家生活中都实现了当家作主的权利。所有这些都使我们的党在新疆各民族人民中扎下了相当牢固的根基。现在我们的党正领导新疆各族人民，在社会主义大道上，奋勇跃进。但是，资产阶级和其他剥削阶级中的反动分子，并不甘心于他们的死亡，仍然千方百计地寻找机会向党进攻。他们认为党提出“正确处理人民内部矛盾”和整风运动是他们向党进攻的好机会，便到处煽风点火，提出他们的反动要求。他们中间许多人是专门在民族问题上兴风作浪、进行破坏的，他们打着“民族”的幌子，以“民族利益的代表者”出现，用“维护民族利益”“爱民族”“民族感情”“民族荣誉感”等等各种漂亮词句来伪装自己，欺骗群众。实际上他们是少数民族中的败类，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的地方民族主义者，是社会主义的敌人。
    这些地方民族主义者想在新疆干什么？
    一、他们首先是企图把新疆从伟大的祖国大家庭中分裂出去。他们认为实行民族区域自治政策建立自治地方的形式是不能解决新疆的民族问题，他们要求分立而成立“维吾尔斯坦”或者是“维吾尔共和国”。他们把今天的区域自治说成是为明天建立共和国的准备阶段。他们反对“新疆”这个名称，说“新疆”就是新的殖民地。他们要求在中国建立加盟共和国或自治共和国，实际上是拿这个做幌子，他们要的是“独立”，是资产阶级共和国的独立，是投靠帝国主义。我国的情况决定了我们应该以建立自治地方的形式来实现祖国的统一而不宜采取联邦制的形式。我国少数民族人口仅占全国人口的百分之六，而分布的情况又多是交错杂居，就以新疆来说，虽然少数民族人口占的比重较大，但是除了维吾尔族以外还有十多个其他的少数民族。同时，由于我国各民族长期以来，在经济上的联系和文化上的交往是很密切的，特别是近三十年来，在中国共产党的领导下，在共同的斗争中，已经形成一个密切不可分离的整体。历史发展形成了各少数民族在祖国大家庭内实行区域自治建立地方的经济和政治基础，没有形成任何建立联邦制的条件。因此，我国不采取联邦制而采取单一国家的制度，作为解决我国民族问题的基本政策是完全正确的，非如此不可的。从新疆推行民族区域自治政策的经验已经充分证明，民族的自治区的确是解决新疆地区民族问题的最好形式，已经得到少数民族广大人民的热烈拥护和衷心支持。资产阶级地方民族主义者之所以疯狂地攻击党的民族政策，提出“共和国”之类的主张，正是说明他们企图分裂祖国和党的统一、破坏无产阶级专政、破坏各民族之间的社会主义合作的狼子野心，他们为了实现他们的罪恶阴谋，还毫无根据地硬说新疆过去曾是“独立”的国家，事实上新疆从来就是中国的一部分，他们这样作只不过是枉费心机的自欺欺人而已。闹独立的地方民族主义分子说新疆土地广大，地下资源丰富，那为什么长久生活在这块土地上的我们的祖先没有干下像解放后八年来在党的领导下和汉族人民的帮助下所作出的成绩呢？只有自然条件，而没有祖国的统一和各族的团结，没有足够的资金、劳力和现代科学技术知识就不可能把地下资源变为人民的财富，没有祖国大家庭各族人民的互助合作，要想一个民族单独的建设成繁荣的社会主义社会是决不可能的。
    二、新疆的资产阶级民族主义者借口新疆维吾尔自治区应该有民族特点，借口实现自治权利和民族化来排斥汉族干部，反对汉族人民到新疆去。谁都知道，几年来新疆各方面的工作在汉族干部和汉族人民的帮助和新疆各族人民的共同努力下已经取得了很大的成绩，各少数民族人民对汉族干部和汉族人民的帮助，都是感之不尽，称赞不已，但是资产阶级民族主义者却反对汉族干部和汉族人民，他们叫嚣
  “机关汉族化了，不是民族化”，他们一有机会就不顾情况不顾条件地增加自治机关中的少数民族干部数量，严重地违犯党和国家的干部政策。他们极力吸收和介绍同他们一个鼻孔出气的人参加工作，他们不管是不是阶级异己分子和反革命分子，只要是本民族的人就吸收为干部，并且予以重用。他们就这样的为机关里的民族干部的百分比的增大而感到自豪，他们企图无故的把汉族干部撤职，为了达到他们的目的不惜否认汉族干部的优点，夸大缺点，甚至捏造事实，对汉族干部大肆攻击。如果有人给他们解释各民族的团结合作的重要，他们就说“应该有爱护自己民族的民族感情”，并且认为对汉族干部只有抱这样的态度才能发挥民族干部的作用，而这在实际上就是为了排斥汉族干部。一些维吾尔族的民族主义者常常高喊“我的维吾尔族”，“本民族利益”等等，不但排斥汉族而且也排斥历来生活在新疆的同一宗教信仰和生活习惯、语言文字方面相近的其他少数民族，认为他们不如维吾尔族进步，反对维吾尔族以外的其他少数民族干部在党和国家机关中担任领导工作。常常在背后说长道短。在他们看来，自己民族的一切都好，其他民族的一切都不好，自己民族不好的也是好的，其他民族好的也是不好的。他们自傲地说维吾尔族的文学艺术高于任何其他一个民族。他们自称是“民族利益的保护者”是“自己民族的热爱者”。实际上他们对自治区其他少数民族又成为大民族主义者。他们是出卖民族利益、让民族脱离自己的伟大祖国和其他兄弟民族走向贫困破产的道路的凶恶敌人。从新疆被揭发的一部分资产阶级地方民族主义者的材料来看，他们所热爱的并不是本民族的劳动人民，而是本民族内部的一小撮封建地主、资产阶级和其他反动分子。
    三、他们反对党的领导，破坏党的统一和团结。他们知道共产党是领导各族人民消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义制度的决定条件，他们为了恢复资本主义和其它剥削制度，就必然要千方百计地攻击党的领导。他们诬蔑说“党的领导是大汉族主义统治”，“没有党的领导，少数民族自己也能得到解放和建设社会主义”。他们对于本民族的党员，特别是负领导责任的党员，也进行恶毒的攻击和谩骂，他们侮蔑站在党的立场上的少数民族领导干部是“被汉族收买了”，“不能代表民族利益”。特别是他们采取分裂党的手段，来达到取消党的目的，他们说别的民族出身的党员不能为自己的民族谋幸福，只有自己民族出身的党员和由自己民族的党员所组成的党组织，才能够为本民族谋幸福，因此，他们极力地排斥在新疆工作的汉族党员干部特别是担任领导工作的汉族党员干部。很明显，他们的目的就是根本不要党的领导。中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，它的目的是在中国实现社会主义和共产主义，它是我国各民族人民的救星。党的组织是根据无产阶级的统一团结和共产主义原则建立起来的，在党内不能有任何宗派和民族界限。因此，那种企图分裂党的组织和按民族成分建党的观点是极端反动的，是与国际主义的原则相违背的。
    地方民族主义在新疆除主要表现在上述三个方面外，也表现在其它许多方面。地方民族主义者的人数虽然不多，但他们的危害性是相当大的，因为他们披着民族的外衣，以“民族利益的维护者”出现，所以在一定的时间内，还能迷惑和欺骗一部分群众。特别是在许多少数民族干部和知识分子中，还程度不同地存在着地方民族主义思想倾向，历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂还没有完全消除的情况下，地方民族主义者伪装的反动活动，就更容易发生影响。因此，我们必须在这次全民性的整风运动中根据党中央的指示，在少数民族中彻底批判地方民族主义思想，坚决粉碎地方民族主义者的阴谋活动。地方民族主义是一种资产阶级的反动思想，反对资产阶级民族主义思想是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的一个重要组成部分，只有坚决批判和克服地方民族主义思想，才能进一步巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，才能彻底完成在我国各民族中的社会主义革命，顺利发展我国各民族的社会主义建设事业。
    新疆各族干部和各族人民对于批判地方民族主义是坚决拥护的。从去年下半年以来，新疆各民族干部已经普遍学习了周总理和乌兰夫副总理在青岛民族工作座谈会上的讲话，学习了邓小平同志在三中全会上的报告，还学习了赛福鼎同志在去年十二月十六日在新疆自治区党委扩大会议上所作的报告。通过对这些文件和报告的学习，各民族干部的政治思想觉悟已经有了很大提高，纷纷表示坚决拥护中央的指示，把批判地方民族主义的斗争进行到底，不获全胜决不收兵。
    最近，新疆自治区党委正在召开扩大会议，批判地方民族主义，我们相信经过这次整风运动，批判了地方民族主义思想，就一定可以大大提高少数民族干部和群众的社会主义觉悟，进一步巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，从而把我国的社会主义革命和建设事业带向新的高潮。目前，新疆也同全国其它各地一样，已经出现了规模巨大的生产大跃进。让我们各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，乘风破浪，奋勇前进。
    以上发言如有不当之处，请批评指正。
