We listened to the reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. We not only felt very excited, but also received a vivid and profound socialist education.

The reports of the two Vice Premiers were composed of numbers, which fully illustrate the great leap forward in China's economic and cultural construction; these figures fully express the revolutionary drive of the people of the whole country to build socialism with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains; these figures fully demonstrate the strong vitality of the socialist system; these figures fully prove that socialism has overcome capitalism. Numbers are the most boring, but the numbers in the reports of the two Vice Premiers are like magnificent battle songs on the construction front, encouraging the people of the whole country to stride towards the road of socialist construction with the spirit of riding the wind and waves.

Why were we able to achieve such great victories on all fronts in the past year? Why is the speed and scale of construction this year (the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan) far exceeding any year of the First Five-Year Plan? The main reason is that the over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan laid the material foundation for the great leap forward in national economic construction in 1958; the new situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind in the international arena has further strengthened the brotherly unity of socialist countries and further increased the strength of mutual support, thereby further strengthening our confidence in rapidly building socialism. The most fundamental driving force is the nationwide rectification movement initiated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, as well as the struggle against the bourgeois rightists in this movement.

Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of the people of the whole country, through the anti-rightist struggle and the great debate between the socialist and capitalist roads in the nationwide rectification movement, have greatly raised their socialist consciousness and greatly increased their enthusiasm for labor. From the fields to the workshops, from the peasants to the workers, everyone is comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, making the backward catch up with the advanced, and making the advanced even more advanced. Just one month after the beginning of 1958, advanced planned quotas have been broken again and again, and have been revised eight or ten times. This is the revolutionary drive that inevitably emerges after the great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, this is the socialist driving force, and this is the most fundamental driving force for the great leap forward in national economic construction in 1958.

After the anti-rightist struggle, we initially realized that although our enterprises have been transformed, we individuals have not been correspondingly transformed, and we are accepting socialist transformation from a capitalist standpoint. Therefore, we are not almost transformed, but are basically still standing on the capitalist standpoint, and need a thorough transformation.

Rectification is the key to all work. Through the rectification movement, an unprecedentedly high socialist enthusiasm has emerged among the workers and peasants. At the same time, the rectification movement has also taken a big step forward for our vast number of industrialists and businessmen on the road of socialist transformation. Before the rectification movement, after the high tide of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, our vast number of industrialists and businessmen thought that after handing over the means of production, they had been almost transformed. If further transformation was needed, it seemed that there was nothing else to do besides preparing to give up fixed interest. After the anti-rightist struggle, the most filthy things existing in our own thoughts and actions were reflected from the mirror of the rightists. When refuting the fallacies of the rightists by presenting the facts and reasoning, we felt shocked again and again in the depths of our minds. It turned out that in the fallacies of the rightists, we had more or less resonance in this or that point. This made us initially realize that we were not almost transformed, but were basically still standing on the capitalist standpoint, and needed a thorough transformation. On the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, our industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai launched a general rectification. In the general rectification, through self-examination and mutual assistance, and using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, we further realized ourselves. It turned out that our unabandoned capitalist standpoint has brought unfavorable effects on the socialist cause in many of our words and deeds. Taking the nine of us as an example, before the rectification movement, we, like the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, thought that we were almost transformed, and considered ourselves to be the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles. If the industrial and commercial circles still needed a thorough transformation, then it was the vast number of other industrialists and businessmen who needed to be transformed, not the backbone members of the industrial and commercial circles. But after the anti-rightist struggle and the general rectification, after systematically examining our own stand and style, and launching criticism and self-criticism, we realized ourselves. It turned out that after the high tide, although our enterprises had been transformed and our economic status had undergone fundamental changes, we individuals had not been correspondingly transformed, and we were accepting socialist transformation from a capitalist standpoint. When the interests of socialism are consistent with our personal interests, we are delighted and support socialism; when the interests of socialism conflict with our personal interests, we will more or less generate some resistance. This shows varying degrees of wavering towards socialism, sometimes hot and sometimes cold. We accept the leadership of the Party, but there will be some feeling of powerlessness in the enterprise, whether hidden or apparent; the great achievements of socialist construction can also inspire our enthusiasm, but we pay more attention to our own abilities, and are more likely to exaggerate and be complacent about our own small achievements, and cannot forget them for a long time. Although the degree to which these aspects are manifested in the nine of us is different, the fact that we have basically not abandoned the capitalist standpoint is the same. Because we have basically not abandoned the capitalist standpoint, we often have some words and deeds that only care about ourselves and disregard the country, which has an adverse impact on socialist interests. For example, at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress in 1956, except for Representative Sheng Pihua, the eight of us spoke on the contradiction between industry and commerce. Although our speeches at that time exposed some contradictions that should be resolved, due to our uncorrected standpoint, we had a sense of dissatisfaction, and our view of the problem was one-sided, and then expanded and generalized, thus obliterating the fact that the achievements of commercial work were the main thing. This example fully illustrates that basically standing on the capitalist standpoint will bring unfavorable effects to the socialist cause at any time. Through rectification, we recognized ourselves, found our shortcomings and mistakes. On the one hand, we felt ashamed that we had not worked hard to transform ourselves in the past, and had failed the Party and the government's cultivation and education of us for more than eight years. On the other hand, it also promoted our determination and courage to transform ourselves.

The Shanghai industrialists and businessmen have formulated six rectification covenants as guidelines for joint action. The covenants stipulate that they must loyally accept the leadership of the Communist Party, be devoted to their duties, obey the leadership of the public sector, participate in physical labor, conscientiously study theory, and run enterprises diligently and thriftily.

Under the leadership of the Party, our vast number of industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai, through the profound education of the rectification movement, realized that they must continue to break down capitalism and establish socialism on the basis of the victory of rectification and anti-rightist movement, change their political stand, take the enterprise as the transformation base, and strive to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers, give full play to the socialist cause, and contribute their strength. For this reason, they have formulated rectification covenants as the common code of conduct for all industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai:

1.  Loyally accept the leadership of the Communist Party, always measure their political stand with the six standards instructed by Chairman Mao, love socialism, and wholeheartedly take the socialist road.
2.  Be devoted to their duties, complete work tasks, actively participate in socialist competition, establish a sense of socialist responsibility, abide by national policies and laws, and resolutely fight against illegal acts and all spontaneous capitalist tendencies.
3.  Obey the leadership of the public sector, accept the supervision of the masses of workers and staff, humbly learn from the working class, be open and honest with each other, unite and help each other, frequently conduct criticism and self-criticism, and actively improve the relationship between the public and private sectors.
4.  Consciously participate in physical labor, learn labor skills in the practice of labor production, gradually establish labor concepts, and cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people.
5.  Conscientiously study socialist political theory and current affairs policies, link with thought, link with reality, improve socialist consciousness and the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and resolutely draw a clear ideological line between the socialist and capitalist roads.
6.  Implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, learn the spirit of hard work and plain living of the working people, and develop a lifestyle of managing the household diligently and thriftily and practicing economy.

In addition to formulating these six rectification covenants as common guidelines for action, each of our Shanghai industrialists and businessmen has also, through self-examination and mutually helpful general rectification, formulated specific personal rectification plans for the future, based on the shortcomings and mistakes they have identified, combined with the requirements of the six covenants and the increasingly developing situation of the country.

We are determined to become genuine working citizens, and prepare in a timely manner to give up fixed interest; strive to learn the truth, continue to adhere to labor training, and constantly carry out self-transformation.

Through the nationwide rectification movement, including the anti-rightist struggle, our industrialists and businessmen have further recognized the right and wrong boundaries between the socialist and capitalist roads, and who is superior and who is inferior. This time, after listening to the reports of the two Vice Premiers, we have seen more clearly the infinite superiority and infinite brilliance of socialism. In the rectification movement, we have received the care and support of the Party, and have achieved great victories in further transformation, which has made us more aware that nothing can be done without the leadership of the Party, and it is impossible for us to achieve transformation. Therefore, the rectification movement has further promoted our sincerity and determination to listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road. The vast majority of the nine of us are both industrialists and businessmen and intellectuals. We know that our transformation is particularly arduous. In the future, under the leadership of the Party, we must make up our minds, strive to learn the truth, and constantly carry out self-transformation, so that we can always adapt to the situation of social development. In this rectification, the Party taught us to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. We deeply feel that this is the most effective method of self-transformation, and we have benefited greatly in this rectification movement. In the future, we must constantly apply it together with the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, so that it becomes a common practice, in order to obtain the benefits of frequent mutual assistance and common improvement. We have participated in voluntary labor. In the face of labor, we realized our incompetence and the glory of labor. The Party's call for intellectuals to transform themselves through labor training is completely correct. We must continue to adhere to labor training, establish labor concepts and the ideological feelings of the working people in the practice of labor, and transform ourselves into genuine working citizens. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, which is the period for the final elimination of exploitation, we must prepare in a timely manner to give up fixed interest, that is, even at present, we must use fixed interest income to buy more public bonds and do more social welfare undertakings. The above are the minimum things we should do in continuing to accept transformation in the future. We understand that the purpose of accepting transformation is to enable us to better serve the socialist cause. Therefore, at present, we should first learn from the revolutionary drive of workers and peasants to build socialism in full swing. We must give full play to our efforts, catch up, and contribute our strength to realizing Chairman Mao's grand call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years or a little more, and to over-fulfilling the national economic plan for 1958.

    不能站在资本主义立场上接受社会主义改造
    王性尧　胡子婴　胡厥文　郭棣活　盛丕华　汤蒂因　荣毅仁刘靖基　魏　如代表的联合发言
    我们听了李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任所作的报告，不仅感到非常兴奋，而且对我们说来，是受了一次生动而深刻的社会主义教育。
    两位副总理的报告，是用数字组成的，这些数字充分说明了我国经济建设和文化建设的大跃进；这些数字充分道出了全国人民以愚公移山的精神来建设社会主义的革命干劲，这些数字充分显示了社会主义制度的强大生命力；这些数字充分证明了社会主义战胜了资本主义。数字是最枯燥的，但是两位副总理报告中的数字，却似建设战线上的雄壮的战歌，鼓舞着全国人民以乘风破浪的气概向社会主义建设的大道迈进。
    为什么过去一年我们能够在各个战线上取得如此伟大的胜利？为什么今年（第二个五年计划的第一年）的建设速度和建设规模远远超过了第一个五年计划的任何一年？主要是第一个五年计划的超额完成，为我们奠定了一九五八年国民经济建设大跃进的物质基础；国际上东风压倒西风的新形势，进一步加强了社会主义各国的兄弟团结，进一步增长了相互支持的力量，从而更坚定了我们迅速地建设社会主义的信心。而最基本的推动力量是中共中央和毛主席倡导的全民性整风运动，以及在这个运动中所进行的反对资产阶级右派的斗争。
    全国广大人民，在党的领导下，经过反右派斗争，经过全民性整风运动中社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，大大提高了劳动积极性，从农田到车间，从农民到工人，到处是比先进，赶先进，使落后的赶上先进，使先进的更加先进。一九五八年刚过完了一个月，先进的计划定额突破又突破，已经修改了十次八次。这就是政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命取得巨大胜利之后必然出现的革命干劲，这就是社会主义动力，这就是一九五八年国民经济建设大跃进的最基本的推动力量。
    在反右派斗争后，我们初步认识到我们的企业虽然得到了改造，但我们个人并没有得到相应的改造，而且是站在资本主义立场上接受社会主义改造的。因此不是改造得差不多了，而是基本上还站在资本主义立场上，需要脱胎换骨的改造。
    整风是提起一切工作的纲，通过整风运动，在工人、农民群众中出现了空前高涨的社会主义干劲。同时，通过整风运动对我们广大工商业者来说，也在社会主义改造的大道上，向前迈进了一大步。在整风运动之前，全行业公私合营高潮之后，我们广大工商业者，自以为交出了生产资料，已经改造得差不多了。如果说再要进一步改造，除了为放弃定息作好准备之外，好像没有什么事可做了。经过反右派斗争，从右派分子这面镜子里反映出了存在于自己思想上和行动上最肮脏的东西，用摆事实、讲道理的方法驳斥右派分子的时候，自己的思想深处一次又一次地感到震动，原来右派分子的谬论中，这一点上或者那一点上自己也或多或少地有过共鸣之处。这样使我们初步认识了自己原来不是改造得差不多了，而是基本上还是站在资本主义立场，需要脱胎换骨地改造。在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，我们上海工商业者展开了一般整风。在一般整风中，经过自我检查和相互帮助，运用了批评与自我批评的武器，使我们更进一步认识了自己。原来我们尚未抛弃的资本主义立场，使我们的许多言行，给社会主义事业带来了不利的影响。就以我们九个人来说，在整风运动之前，我们和广大工商业者一样，以为改造得差不多了，而且自以为是工商界中的骨干。如果说工商界还需要脱胎换骨地改造，那末需要改造的是广大的其他工商业者，而不是工商业者中的骨干分子。但是经过反右派斗争和一般整风，经过了系统地检查自己的立场和作风，展开了批评与自我批评，才认识了自己。原来高潮之后，我们的企业虽然得到了改造，我们的经济地位已经起了根本变化，但我们个人并没有得到相应的改造，我们是站在资本主义立场来接受社会主义改造。当社会主义的利益与我们个人利益一致的时候，我们欢欣鼓舞，拥护社会主义；当社会主义的利益与我们个人利益有矛盾的时候，或多或少地会产生一些抵触情绪。这样就表现出不同程度的对社会主义忽冷忽热的摇摆状态。我们是接受党的领导的，但在企业中或隐或现地会出现一些大权旁落之感；社会主义建设的伟大成就，也能鼓舞我们的热情，但是更重视自己的能力，对自己的点滴小成绩，更易于突出夸大，沾沾自喜，久久不能忘怀。我们九个人表现在这些方面的程度虽然各有不同，但是基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场这一点是相同的。因为基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场，就时常会有一些只顾个人不顾国家的言行，使社会主义利益受到不利影响。例如一九五六年第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议开会时，除了盛丕华代表，我们八个人曾经为工业和商业之间的矛盾问题发了言。虽然当时我们的发言是揭露了一些应该解决的矛盾问题，但是，由于我们的立场没有端正，有着一种不服气的情绪，看问题就失于片面，再加以扩大、概括，这样就抹煞了商业工作的成绩是主要的事实。从这一事例充分说明了基本上站在资本主义立场随时会给社会主义事业带来不利的影响。我们通过整风，认识了自己，找到了自己的缺点和错误，我们一面惶愧地感到由于过去没有努力自我改造，辜负了党和政府八年多来对我们的培养和教育，但另一面也促进了我们改造自己的决心和勇气。
    上海工商业者订出六条整改公约，作为共同行动的准则。公约规定要忠诚地接受共产党的领导，守职尽责，服从公方领导，参加体力劳动，认真学习理论，勤俭办企业。
    我们上海的广大工商业者，在党的领导下，经过整风运动的深刻教育，认识到自己必须在整风反右胜利的基础上，继续破资本主义，立社会主义，改变自己的政治立场，以企业为改造基地，努力把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者，为社会主义事业鼓足干劲，贡献力量，为此已经订立了整改公约，作为我们上海全体工商业者共同的行动准则：
    一、忠诚接受共产党的领导，时刻以毛主席指示的六项标准来衡量自己的政治立场，热爱社会主义，一心一意走社会主义道路。
    二、守职尽责，完成工作任务，积极参加社会主义竞赛，树立社会主义责任感，遵守国家的政策法令，坚决同非法行为和一切资本主义自发倾向作斗争。
    三、服从公方领导，接受职工群众的监督，虚心向工人阶级学习，并开诚相见，团结互助，经常进行批评与自我批评，积极搞好公私共事关系。
    四、自觉地参加体力劳动，在劳动生产的实践中，学会劳动本领，逐步建立劳动观点，培养劳动人民的思想感情。
    五、认真学习社会主义政治理论和时事政策，联系思想，联系实际，提高社会主义觉悟和辨别是非能力，坚决划清社会主义和资本主义两条道路的思想界线。
    六、贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业，学习劳动人民艰苦朴素的精神，养成勤俭持家、勤俭节约的生活作风。
    除了订立这样六条作为共同行动准则的整改公约之外，我们上海工商业者每一个人还通过自我检查和互相帮助的一般整风，针对着自己检查出来的缺点和错误，结合着六条公约的要求，国家日益发展的形势，订出了今后继续进行自我改造的个人的具体整改计划。
    我们决心要成为名副其实的劳动公民，及时做好放弃定息的准备；努力学习真理，继续坚持劳动锻炼，不断进行自我改造。
    经过了包括反右派斗争在内的全民整风运动，使我们工商业者进一步认清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路谁优谁劣的是非界线。这次又听了两位副总理的报告，使我们更看清了社会主义的无限优越、无限光辉。在整风运动中，我们受到了党的关怀和支持，才获得进一步改造的巨大胜利，使我们更认识到离开了党的领导，什么事情都做不成的，我们要获得改造也是不可能的。因此整风运动更加促进了我们听毛主席话，跟共产党走，走社会主义道路的诚心和决心。我们九个人的极大多数，既是工商业者，又是知识分子，我们知道自己的改造是特别艰巨的。今后一定在党的领导下，下定决心，努力学习真理，不断进行自我改造，使自己永远能够适应社会发展的形势。在这次整风中，党教会了我们运用批评与自我批评的武器，我们深刻感受到这是自我改造最有效的方法，在这次整风运动中是受益匪浅的。今后我们要和广大工商业者一起不断的加以运用，使其成为风气，以期获得经常地相互帮助，共同提高的效益。我们曾经参加过义务劳动，在劳动的面前，我们才认识到自己的无能，才认识到劳动的光荣，党号召知识分子从劳动锻炼中来改造自己是完全正确的，我们要继续坚持劳动锻炼，要从劳动的实践中建立劳动观点，建立劳动人民的思想感情，使自己改造成为名副其实的劳动公民。在第二个五年计划期间，是最后消灭剥削的期间，我们一定及时做好放弃定息的准备，即在目前，也要以定息收入多买公债，多做社会公益事业。以上的种种，是我们今后继续接受改造中最起码应该做到的事。我们懂得接受改造的目的，是为了使我们 能更好地为社会主义事业服务。因此，在目前首先应该学习工人、农民热火朝天地建设社会主义的革命干劲，我们要鼓足干劲，迎头赶上，为实现毛主席提出的在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的豪迈号召，为超额完成国家一九五八年的国民经济计划，贡献我们的力量。
