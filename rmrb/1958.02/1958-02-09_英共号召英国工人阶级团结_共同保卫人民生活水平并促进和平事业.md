　　Xinhua News Agency, London, February 8th: The Communist Party of Great Britain calls on the working class to unite to defend the living standards of the British people and promote the cause of peace.

　　Harry Pollitt, Chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and John Gollan, General Secretary, made this request in a letter to the three joint secretaries of the National Labor Conference (Vincent Tewson of the Trades Union Congress, Morgan Phillips of the Labor Party, and Soson of the Cooperative).

　　The letter was sent on February 4th and released last night. The letter stated: "It has become increasingly clear that the Conservative government intends to reduce the living standards of the British people and obstruct all sincere efforts to seek peace." In this regard, the letter pointed out: the government's current policy effectively negates any increase in wages, and this policy is also a declaration of war on the trade unions. The government also intends to cut spending on social services in next year's budget. At the same time, the Conservatives are selling out Britain, concealing from the people the dangers of planes carrying hydrogen bombs on patrol, agreeing to the establishment of American rocket bases, and paying lip service to a summit conference while refusing to take the initial steps towards a summit conference.

　　The letter calls for joint action to defeat the Conservative's divide-and-rule policy and assures that the Communist Party fully supports all joint actions taken by the National Labor Conference to defend the living standards of the British people and promote the cause of peace.

　　英共号召英国工人阶级团结
    共同保卫人民生活水平并促进和平事业
    新华社伦敦8日电　英国共产党要求工人阶级团结起来保卫英国人民的生活水平并且促进和平事业。
    英国共产党主席哈里·波立特和总书记约翰·高兰在写给全国劳工会议的三个联合书记（职工大会的文森特·陶逊、工党的摩根·菲利普斯和合作社的索森）的信中提出了这种要求。
    这封信是在2月4日发出而在昨天晚上公布的。这封信说：“保守党政府打算降低英国人民的生活水平并且阻挠一切真诚谋求和平的行动，这一点已经日益明显。”这封信就此指出：政府目前奉行的政策实际上否决了工资的任何提高，这种政策也是对工会的宣战。政府目前还打算在下一年度的预算中削减社会服务事业的费用。同时保守党人正在出卖英国，他们向人民掩饰飞机装载氢弹运行巡逻的危险，同意美国建立火箭基地，并且空谈最高级会议而拒绝采取走向最高级会议的初步步骤。
    这封信要求采取联合行动以击败保守党分而治之的政策，并且保证共产党完全支持全国劳工会议为了保卫英国人民的生活水平和促进和平事业而采取的一切联合行动。
