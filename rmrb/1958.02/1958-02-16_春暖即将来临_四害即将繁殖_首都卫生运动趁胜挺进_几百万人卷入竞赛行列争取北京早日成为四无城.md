Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: After more than two months of arduous struggle, the people of the capital have achieved a great victory in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene: overwintering mosquitoes and flies in urban and suburban areas have basically disappeared, and 2.27 million rats and sparrows have been eliminated; areas inhabited by 1.6 million people, about one-third of the city's population, have reached the "four-no" standard.

	Guarantee Conditions Improve, "Four-No" Deadline Shortens
	Since the launch of the capital's campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene on December 5 last year, the broad masses have immediately plunged into the vigorous struggle to eliminate rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies. The city-wide competition conference held on January 15 this year brought the movement to a new stage. Thousands of regions and units set conditions and launched a grand competition to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. The current situation in the city is: the climax of the competition is higher than the last, the guaranteed conditions are getting higher and higher, the deadline for achieving "four-no" is getting shorter and shorter, the number of areas and units eliminating the four pests is increasing, and social customs have undergone great changes. After the Qianmen District proposed the challenge of achieving "four-no" by the end of this year, Dongsi District and Xidan District responded with the condition of realizing "four-no" before September to welcome National Day; Xuanwu District then wanted to become a "four-no" district by the end of June, and Xisi District was determined to dedicate its "four-no" achievements to May Day. In order to achieve "four-no" as soon as possible, residents of Fusujing in Xisi District, after catching all the sparrows and rats, used their hands to mix mud and block sparrow nests and rat holes in the severe cold of minus 22 degrees Celsius. Residents of Baochao Hutong climbed ladders more than ten meters high to block sparrow nests on the city walls. Residents of the Zhazipo Subdistrict Office mobilized more than 1,400 people and 66 large carts in two days to fill more than 70 stagnant water pits where mosquitoes breed.

	Grasp the Advanced, Grasp the Backward, Lead the Middle Forward Together
	Grasping the advanced, grasping the backward, and leading the middle is a prominent feature of Beijing's movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. At the beginning of the movement, many leading cadres in various regions and units lacked confidence and methods to eliminate the four pests. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee discovered that the masses in the jurisdiction of the Fusujing Subdistrict Office had created many experiences in eliminating the four pests, and quickly helped to study and summarize these experiences and introduce and promote them to other units. This subdistrict office then proposed a challenge with the condition of achieving "four-no" in a very short period of time, which promoted the city-wide competition. Various districts, townships, subdistrict offices, and many organizations also adopted this method to drive the vast intermediate areas and units to move forward together. Some units, due to the lack of attention from the leadership, have been in a backward state. The three levels of leadership organs of the city, district, and subdistrict offices and the broad masses tried every possible means to promote their conscious action and catch up quickly. The Black Metallurgical Design Institute used to have very poor environmental hygiene conditions, with garbage in the courtyard and many sputum stains in the office building corridors. Relevant departments repeatedly urged them, but they still did not take action. The neighboring Ministry of Food Industry challenged them, and this unit was quickly promoted. It has now carried out four cleanups and fumigated mosquitoes three times. The processing workshop of the Beijing Fifth Woodworking Production Cooperative had not been cleaned for more than a year. Cadres of the Second Residents' Committee of the Chaoyang Market Subdistrict Office in Dongdan District and street activists repeatedly urged them, but received no response. However, when a big-character poster appeared at the entrance of the workshop, demanding that they quickly clean up, the director of the cooperative immediately rushed to the workshop, mobilized the workers to clean the interior and the street, and selected a workshop hygiene supervisor to establish a rotating duty system for cleaning. The Dongsihui Electroplating Factory was also a unit that did not pay much attention to hygiene, with garbage piled up on both sides of the factory aisle. The Dongsi District Patriotic Health Campaign Committee had repeatedly urged and inspected this factory, but failed to move it. The负责人of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee took off their coats with the cadres who went to inspect and helped the factory to clean up. This action moved all the employees of the factory. In addition to reviewing the shortcomings of emphasizing production, poor conditions, and not paying attention to hygiene in the past, factory director Chen Baiyuan also mobilized all employees to quickly carry out cleaning.

	"Blocks" Provide Overall Leadership, "Lines" Implement
	To do a good job in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, all units are required to have a unified understanding, unified requirements, and unified actions without exception. At the beginning of the movement, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee determined the principle of combining the overall leadership of "blocks" (referring to regions) and the implementation of "lines" (referring to systems), stipulating that the city, district, and subdistrict offices are responsible for the overall leadership of the health work in their respective areas. All organs, schools, factories, and enterprises must separately implement the tasks uniformly arranged by the location and unconditionally accept their inspection and supervision. During the movement, various organs of the Central Government and Beijing Municipality sent capable cadres to participate in the meetings of the district and subdistrict offices to discuss health work. The central state organs also frequently convened subordinate units for inspection. According to the unified deployment of Beijing Municipality, General Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally took charge and mobilized and inspected the work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene in various military organs stationed in Beijing several times. This method of combining "blocks" and "lines" ensures the unified, comprehensive, and in-depth development of Beijing's movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

	The various blitz activities carried out in the capital's movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene played a great role in widely mobilizing the masses and promoting health work. At the beginning of eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee found that the development of the movement was unbalanced, some masses lacked sufficient understanding of the significance of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, and some units were not very energetic. For this reason, a large-scale blitz week activity was held throughout the city, with 150,000 people dispatched to publicize and more than 10,000 people participating in inspections, making the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene basically known to every household. During the rat extermination month, according to the characteristics of rats being good at fleeing, a blitz approach was also adopted, with all districts acting together to uniformly put out poisoned bait, leaving rats nowhere to hide. During the blitz to catch sparrows, under the slogan of "doing everything possible, from all directions, and encircling and suppressing comprehensively," hundreds and thousands of blitz teams were organized to catch sparrows and block nests. In addition, various organs, schools, factories, enterprises, and subdistrict offices also carried out blitz activities centered on various tasks.

	"You Inspect Me," "I Inspect You," Linking and Learning from Each Other
	The city-wide grand competition to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, which began in Beijing in mid-January, involved millions of people in the competition, marching towards the "four pests." At the same time, through inspection and evaluation, the movement was quickly developed widely and deeply. In the competition, "lines" and "blocks" carried out layer-by-layer inspection, mutual inspection, and frequent inspection. Many units with challenging and responding relationships were linked to each other, "you inspect me," "I inspect you," and evaluated and learned from each other. Cadres and masses from the Baochao Hutong Subdistrict Office went to the Fusujing Subdistrict Office, which challenged them, to observe and inspect. After discovering the two good methods of having covers on sewage pools and not putting coal briquettes and firewood in the house, they immediately made wooden covers for more than 40 sewage pools in their area and organized a mutual aid team of more than 300 people to help residents move coal briquettes and firewood from inside the house to outside.

	Now, crowds of people inspecting hygiene can be seen on the streets and alleys of the capital every day. Many people used to be afraid of being inspected, but now they put up signs at the door saying that their unit or yard has achieved "four-no" and welcomes inspection. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has decided to hold two city-wide large-scale evaluations in May and September this year to further promote the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

	The people of the capital have achieved great results in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in the past two months. However, the movement has not been carried out universally and deeply enough, and the guidance of specialized technology cannot keep up with the needs of the mass movement. Now that spring is approaching and the four pests will soon breed and reproduce, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has decided to further mobilize the masses on the basis of the initial victory that has been achieved, ride the wind and waves, and make the capital the most civilized "four-no" city as soon as possible.

    春暖即将来临  四害即将繁殖
    首都卫生运动趁胜挺进
    几百万人卷入竞赛行列争取北京早日成为四无城
    据新华社15日讯　首都人民经过两个多月的艰苦奋战，已经取得了除四害讲卫生运动的巨大胜利：城郊各区的越冬蚊蝇基本绝迹，二百二十七万只老鼠和麻雀被消灭；约占全市人口三分之一的一百六十万人所在的地区已达到“四无”。
    保证条件越提越高  四无期限越来越短
    首都的除四害讲卫生运动从去年12月5日揭开序幕以后，广大群众立即投入了如火如荼的消灭鼠、雀、蚊、蝇的斗争。今年1月15日举行的全市竞赛大会，把这个运动带进了一个新的阶段，成千上万个地区和单位，订出条件，展开除四害、讲卫生的大竞赛。目前全市的形势是：竞赛的高潮一浪高过一浪，保证的条件越提越高，做到四无的期限越来越短，消灭四害的地区和单位越来越多，社会风气有了很大变易。前门区提出在今年年底做到四无的挑战以后，东四区和西单区就以9月份以前实现“四无”迎接国庆节的条件来应战；宣武区接着要在6月底成为“四无”区，西四区就决心用“四无”的成绩向“五一”劳动节献礼。为了早日实现“四无”，西四区福绥境的居民捉光了麻雀、老鼠以后，在零下二十二度的严寒天气里，用手和泥堵雀窝、塞鼠洞。宝钞胡同的居民，登上三丈多高的梯子，堵城墙上的雀窝。渣子坡街道办事处的居民，两天内就出动了一千四百多人和六十六辆大车，填了七十多个孳生蚊子的积水坑洼。
    抓先进　抓落后带动中间一起前进
    抓先进，抓落后，带动中间，是北京除四害、讲卫生运动中的一个显著的特点。运动开始的时候，不少地区和单位的领导干部对能不能除掉四害缺乏信心和办法。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会发现了福绥境街道办事处管界的群众创造了很多除四害的经验，就迅速帮助研究、总结这些经验，向其他单位介绍推广。这个街道办事处随后又以在很短的时间内实现四无为条件提出挑战，推动了全市范围的大竞赛。各区、各乡、各街道办事处和许多机关团体也都采取了这种办法，带动广大的中间地区和单位一起前进。有些单位由于领导不重视，一直处于落后状态，市、区、街道办事处三级领导机关和广大群众就千方百计地推动他们自觉地行动起来，急起直追。黑色冶金设计院过去环境卫生情况很不好，院内有垃圾，办公室楼道有许多痰迹，有关方面多次督促他们，仍不动手，邻近的食品工业部向他们提出挑战，这个单位就很快被推动起来了，现在已经作了四次扫除，熏了三次蚊子。北京市第五木器生产合作社加工车间有一年多没有打扫了。东单区朝阳市场办事处第二居民委员会的干部和街道积极分子屡次督促他们，但都得不到反应。但当这个车间门口出现了一张居民要求他们迅速扫除的大字报后，这个社的主任立即赶到车间，动员工人们把室内和街道打扫得干干净净，并且选出了车间卫生负责人，建立了轮流值日打扫的制度。东四电镀厂也是一个很不讲究卫生的单位，工厂过道两边就堆积着垃圾。东四区爱国卫生运动委员会对这个厂曾进行过多次督促检查，但都推不动它。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会的负责人就和前往检查的干部一起，脱下外衣，帮助这个厂打扫。这种行动感动了全厂职工，厂长陈白元除对过去强调生产忙、条件差、不重视卫生工作的缺点作了检讨外，并发动全厂职工很快地进行了打扫。
    “块块”全面领导  “条条”贯彻执行
    除四害、讲卫生运动要做得好，就要求各单位无例外地统一认识、统一要求、统一行动。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会在运动一开始就确定了“块块”（指地区）全面领导和“条条”（指系统）贯彻执行的两相结合的领导原则，规定市、区、街道办事处对所属地区的卫生工作负责全面领导，所有的机关、学校、工厂、企业，都要按照所在地区统一布置的任务分别贯彻执行，并且无条件地接受其检查监督。在运动中，中央和北京市的各个机关，都派了得力干部参加所在的区、街道办事处讨论卫生工作的会议。中央国家机关并经常召集所属单位进行检查。中国人民解放军副总参谋长张宗逊上将根据北京市统一的布置，亲自出马，几次动员和检查各驻京军事机关除四害、讲卫生的工作。这种“块块”、“条条”相结合的方法，保证了北京市除四害、讲卫生运动统一、全面和深入地开展起来。
    首都在除四害、讲卫生运动中进行的各种突击活动，对广泛地发动群众和推动卫生工作起了很大的作用。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会在开始消灭过冬残存蚊蝇的时候，发现运动发展不平衡，有些群众对除四害、讲卫生的意义认识不足，部分单位劲头不大。为此在全市范围内举行了大规模的突击周活动，十五万人出动宣传，一万多人参加检查，使除四害、讲卫生运动基本上做到了家喻户晓。在灭鼠运动月，根据老鼠善于逃窜的特点，也采取了突击的方式，各区一起行动，统一投放药饵，使老鼠无处藏身。突击捕雀的时候，在“千方百计、四面八方、全面围剿”的口号下，组织了成百上千个突击队，捉雀堵窝。此外，各机关、学校、工厂、企业和街道办事处，也都进行了以各种不同任务为中心的突击活动。
    “你查我”“我查你”  互相挂钩互相学习
    北京在1月中旬开始的全市规模的除四害、讲卫生大竞赛，把几百万人民都卷进了竞赛的行列，向“四害”进军。同时通过检查和评比，就迅速地使运动又广又深地开展起来。在竞赛中，“条条”、“块块”都进行了层层检查、互相检查和经常检查。很多有挑战、应战关系的单位都互相挂钩，“你查我”“我查你”，并且互相评比，互相学习。宝钞胡同办事处的干部和群众到向他们挑战的福绥境街道办事处去观摩检查，发现后一地区污水池都有盖子和煤球、劈柴不放在屋里的两个好办法以后，立即给本地区的四十多个污水池做了木盖，并且组织了三百多人的互助队，帮助居民把煤球、劈柴从屋里搬到屋外。
    现在，在首都大街小巷里每天都可以看到检查卫生的人群。很多人过去怕被人检查，现在在门口贴上本单位或本院已经做到四无，欢迎检查的纸条。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会已经决定在今年5月、9月举行两次全市规模的大评比，以进一步推动除四害、讲卫生运动。
    首都人民在两个多月的除四害、讲卫生运动中已经取得了巨大的成绩，但是，运动还开展得不够普遍和深入，专门技术的指导跟不上群众运动的需要。现在，春暖即将来临，四害即将孳生、繁殖，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会为此已经决定在已经取得初步胜利的基础上，进一步发动群众，乘风破浪，使首都尽早成为最文明的四无城。
