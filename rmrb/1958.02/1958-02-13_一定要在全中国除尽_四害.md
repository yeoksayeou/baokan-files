    Must Eradicate the "Four Pests" Throughout China

    Today, this newspaper publishes the directive from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council regarding the elimination of the four pests and the promotion of hygiene. This directive is of utmost importance for further advancing the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests throughout the country. The directive requires the entire Party and government to resolutely and actively lead this movement, expanding it to all areas that have essentially completed socialist transformation during the spring and summer of this year, truly reaching a level where every household knows and everyone participates. The directive also proposes that this spring, every province, city, autonomous region, county, district, township, cooperative, factory, mine, enterprise, organization, school, and military unit should formulate its own annual and long-term plans for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, and must lay a solid foundation for realizing the long-term plans within this year.

    Since winter, the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests has gradually gained momentum nationwide. Many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have held rallies to pledge the elimination of the four pests, mobilizing all people, young and old, men and women. Cadres and the masses are full of energy and confidence, launching a grand campaign against flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows, and deciding to achieve "four-without" status ahead of schedule, within two, three, four, five, or eight years.

    The struggle to eliminate the four pests is an important part of humanity's historic great struggle to wage war against nature and conquer nature. Earth has had humans for hundreds of thousands of years, and China has had recorded history for over four thousand years. Although people in our history have continuously fought against nature, never before have we proactively, organizedly, and on a large scale launched an offensive against pests, harmful beasts, and harmful birds that poison the people, always remaining in a position of passive defense. Even in the European and American capitalist countries that call themselves "civilized nations," no country has been able to eliminate flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows. Because eliminating the four pests is an unprecedented feat, achieving "four-without" status is absolutely impossible without the general mobilization of the broad masses of the people, which is fundamentally unattainable in a society where the people are subjected to oppression and enslavement. Western colonizers insulted China as the "sick man of East Asia," saying we were backward and dirty. In fact, this is not the fault of the people, because in those dark ages, the broad masses of working people could not get enough to eat or wear, "warm in winter but the child cries of cold, abundant harvest but the wife weeps of hunger," how could they talk about eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene!? However, once our people were liberated and became masters of the country, they made a preliminary show of their strength in the patriotic health campaign against American bacteriological warfare in 1952 and achieved great success. Especially after the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production was basically completed, the Party Central Committee put forward the forty articles, calling for the elimination of the four pests and the promotion of hygiene, and the Chinese people more powerfully launched a struggle against pests, harmful beasts, harmful birds, and various epidemics, unveiling the prelude to this battle line in the great battle to conquer nature. Therefore, from a historical perspective, eliminating the four pests is by no means a trivial matter, but a groundbreaking event in Chinese history.

    Flies, mosquitoes, and rats are vectors for spreading diseases, while rats and sparrows are major enemies that damage grain and hinder production. The fundamental purpose of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene is to "eliminate diseases, invigorate everyone, change customs and habits, and transform the country." For many years, disease has been a serious threat to the Chinese people. Although the Chinese people have accumulated much valuable experience in preventing and controlling diseases, it was impossible to completely eliminate the root causes of diseases in the old society. The unhygienic habits and superstitious customs left over from the old society greatly affected people's health and the elimination of diseases. The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests is to eliminate various diseases and their root causes, promote the health of the people, and invigorate everyone by starting with the elimination of the four pests, popularizing hygiene knowledge, and breaking superstitions through mass movements, so as to change customs and habits. In this way, the Chinese people can transform from weakness and sickness to health and strength, from backwardness to advancement, and the face of our country can be completely renewed. This is a major aspect of China's great cultural revolution. Therefore, from the perspective of China's actual situation, eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene is by no means an optional trivial matter, but a major matter that should be greatly emphasized and vigorously carried out.

    After the nationwide rectification campaign and socialist education that began last year, especially after the Party Central Committee re-revised and promulgated the National Agricultural Development Program last winter, and repeatedly emphasized the great significance of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, all parts of the country have paid more attention to launching the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. However, there are also some people who doubt whether the four pests can be completely eliminated, whether unhygienic habits can be changed, and whether various difficulties can be overcome, or who are skeptical, lack confidence, and lack enthusiasm. It should be pointed out that this doubt, if it could be said to have some reason a year or two ago, is now completely unfounded, after many four-without villages, four-without townships, four-without towns, four-without streets, and four-without factories and mines have emerged throughout the country. Of course, to complete the elimination of the four pests and to achieve the requirements of "eliminating diseases, invigorating everyone, changing customs and habits, and transforming the country," it is not without difficulties, and it should be said that the difficulties are not small, but very large. Because since this is an unprecedented feat, difficulties are naturally unavoidable. The question is what attitude we take towards difficulties, whether to succumb to them or to stubbornly overcome them?

    In fact, many four-without villages, four-without townships, four-without towns, and four-without streets in cities did not achieve "four-without" status easily, and often their original sanitary conditions were particularly difficult. For example, in Chengqi Village in Fujian Province in southern China, there were originally many rats that bit chickens and pigs during the day and people at night. According to historical records, there have been more than 50 outbreaks of plague since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. Among the 2,000 patients with statistics, more than 1,500 died, and no less than 100 families were wiped out, with one family of 23 people all dying of plague. A folk song said: "People in Chengqi Village are panicked, the plague is raging, daughters die yesterday, sons die today, it is difficult to survive the eighth month." After the draft National Agricultural Development Program was promulgated, the village launched a rat-catching campaign in October 1956, mobilizing the masses. After more than a year of arduous efforts, they finally basically eliminated the rats, thereby eliminating the plague. An old woman said: "The Communist Party has done thousands of meritorious deeds, and eliminating rats is a great achievement." If Chengqi Village, where there were so many rats and such a severe plague, can become a rat-free village, why can't places with much better conditions than this village eliminate rats?

    Another example is Chengjiagiao Village, a remote mountainous area in Junan County, Shandong Province, which used to be a "six-many" village (many broken stones on the road, many garbage and feces, many stinky puddles, many mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows, many sores and diseases, and many deaths of people and animals due to illness), with very poor sanitary conditions. Starting in 1953, after five years of unremitting struggle, it finally became a model village for eliminating the four pests. Since such a backward mountainous village can eliminate the four pests, why can't other villages with better conditions also become "four-without" villages?

    Another example is Jinhua Street in Guangzhou, where more than 3,000 poor working people live. It used to be called "Three Stinky Street" (stinky ditches, stinky garbage dumps, stinky feces). After liberation, they gradually developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene. In this emergency sanitation campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, it quickly became "Three Eliminations" (mosquitoes, flies, rats) and "Six Withouts" (no dust, no garbage, no feces, no sewage, no spitting, no sundries) street. Why can't other city streets with better or the same conditions as this street do the same?

    The conclusion is: success depends on human effort. As long as the local Party committees attach importance to this work, effectively lead it, fully carry out propaganda and education work, widely mobilize the masses, and take effective technical measures, they will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties, eliminate the four pests, and make the masses develop the habit of paying attention to hygiene.

    Now, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country are vying to launch the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which started later, are now catching up. Judging from the recent situation, the goal of eliminating the four pests and basically eliminating the diseases that most seriously harm the local people within ten years is completely achievable. The task of the entire Party and the people of the whole country is to resolutely implement the directives of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, exert full effort, act vigorously and decisively, check and supervise on a monthly and quarterly basis, persist to the end, and strive to lay a solid foundation for eliminating the four pests within this year, and strive to eliminate the "four pests" throughout China in ten years or even less, making our country a prosperous and happy "four-without" nation.

### 一定要在全中国除尽“四害”

    一定要在全中国除尽“四害”
    今天本报发表了中共中央和国务院关于除四害讲卫生的指示。这个指示对于全国进一步展开以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，有着极其重要的意义。这个指示要求全党和政府坚决地积极地领导这个运动，在今年春夏两季把这个运动发展到全国一切已经基本上完成社会主义改造的地方，真正达到家喻户晓、人人动手的程度。这个指示还提出，要在今年春季，使每一省、市、自治区，每一县区，每个乡镇，每个合作社、厂矿企业、机关、学校、部队，都订出自己的除四害、讲卫生的年度计划和长期计划，而且务必在今年内打下实现长期计划的巩固的基础。
    以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，自入冬以来逐渐在全国范围内形成高潮。许多省、市、自治区召开了除四害的誓师大会，男女老少全民动员，干部和群众干劲十足，信心百倍，向苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀大进军；并且决定提前在两年、或者三年、或者四年、或者五年、或者八年内实现“四无”。
    除四害的斗争是人类向自然开战、征服自然的历史性的伟大斗争的一个重要组成部分。地球上自从有人类以来已有几十万年的历史，而我国自从有历史记载以来也有四千多年的历史。我国历史上人们虽然也不断地向自然界进行斗争，却从来没有一次主动地有组织地大规模地向毒害人民的害虫、害兽、害鸟发动进攻，总是处于被动的防御的地位。即使在自称为“文明之邦”的欧美资本主义各国，迄今也没有哪个国家能够做到把苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀消灭掉。因为除四害是前无古人的壮举，要实现“四无”，没有广大人民群众的总动员是绝对不可能的，而这在人民群众备受压迫、奴役的社会里是根本办不到的。西方的殖民者侮辱我国是“东亚病夫”，说我们落后，说我们脏。其实，这并不是人民的过错，因为在那些黑暗的年代里，广大劳动群众饭不充饥、衣不蔽体，“冬暖而儿号寒，年丰而妻啼饥”，那里谈得上除四害、讲卫生呢！？然而，我们的人民一旦获得了解放，成了国家的主人之后，在1952年的反对美国细菌战的爱国卫生运动中就初试锋芒，获得了巨大的成就。特别是在基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，党中央提出了四十条，号召除四害、讲卫生之后，我国人民就更加有力地展开了对害虫、害兽、害鸟以及各种流行病疫的斗争，揭开了征服自然的伟大战斗中这个战线的序幕。因此，从历史上看，除四害决不是无足轻重的小事，而是我国历史上破天荒的大事。
    苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠是传播疾病的媒介，而老鼠和麻雀还是损耗粮食、妨害生产的大敌。除四害、讲卫生的根本目的，就是“消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造国家”。多少年来，疾病对于我国人民是一个严重的威胁。我国人民虽然积累了许多宝贵的防治疾病的经验，但在旧社会中无法彻底消灭疾病的根源。从旧社会遗留下来的不讲卫生的习惯和迷信的风俗又大大影响了人民的健康和疾病的消除。以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，就是通过群众运动的方式，从除四害做起，普及卫生常识，破除迷信，彻底消灭各种疾病和它们的根源，增进人民体质的健康，使人人振奋，移风易俗。这样，我国人民就可以转病弱为健强、转落后为先进，我们国家的面貌就可以焕然一新。这是我国的伟大的文化革命的一个主要方面。因此，从我国的实际情况来说，除四害、讲卫生也决不是一件可有可无的小事，而是应当大讲特讲、大做特做的大事。
    经过了去年开始的全民整风运动和社会主义教育，特别是党中央去年入冬以后重新修正公布全国农业发展纲要，并且一再强调除四害、讲卫生的重大意义之后，全国各地都比较重视展开以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动了。但是，也并不是没有人对四害是否能除尽、不卫生的习惯能否改变、各种困难能否克服，发生怀疑，或者半信半疑，信心不足，劲头不大。应当指出，这种怀疑，如果在一两年前还可以说有些道理的话，那末，在现在，在全国已经涌现了许多四无村、四无乡、四无镇、四无街道、以及四无厂矿等等之后，就完全没有根据的了。当然，要完成除四害，要达到“消灭疾病，人人振奋，移风易俗，改造国家”的要求，并不是没有困难的，而且应当说，困难不是很小，而是很大的。因为既然这是前无古人的壮举，自然就免不了困难。问题在于我们对困难采取什么态度，是向困难屈服呢？还是顽强地战胜困难呢？
    事实上，许多四无村、四无乡、四无镇和城市中的四无街道，并不是轻而易举地实现“四无”的，而且往往是他们原来的卫生条件特别困难。例如，在我国南方的福建省的澄岐村，原来老鼠特多，白天咬鸡咬猪，晚上咬人。据历史记载，从清朝光绪年间起就不断发生鼠疫五十多次。在有统计的二千个患者中，死亡一千五百多人，灭门绝户的不下百家，有一家全家二十三口全部死于鼠疫。有一首民谣说：“澄岐村里人心慌，流行鼠瘟闹惶惶，昨朝死女今死男，在世难跨八月关。”在全国农业发展纲要草案公布后，从1956年10月起，这个村展开了捕鼠运动，发动了群众，经过一年多的艰巨努力，终于基本上消灭了老鼠，从而也消灭了鼠疫。一位老太婆说：“共产党领导千功万功，消灭老鼠是一大功。”原来老鼠这么多、鼠疫这么严重的澄岐村都能成为无鼠村，为什么条件比这个村好得多的地方不能消灭老鼠呢？
    又如山东的莒南县偏僻山区的程家峧村，过去是一个“六多”（路上碎石多，垃圾粪便多，臭水坑多，蚊蝇鼠雀多，生疮患病的多，人畜因病死亡多）村，卫生条件十分坏，从1953年开始，经过五年不懈的奋斗，终于成为消灭四害的模范村了。原来这样落后的山区村庄能够除尽四害，为什么条件较好的其他村庄不能也成为“四无”村呢？
    又如广州的金花街，那里居住着三千多户穷苦的劳动人民，原来被叫做“三臭街”（坑渠臭、垃圾堆臭、粪便臭），解放后，逐渐养成讲卫生的习惯，在这次以除四害为中心的突击卫生运动中很快地就成了“三灭”（蚊、蝇、鼠）、“六无”（无尘土、无垃圾、无粪便、无污水、无口痰、无杂物）街道。为什么条件比这街道好或者条件相同的其他城市街道不能一样做到呢？
    结论是：事在人为。只要各地党委重视这一工作，切实地领导起来，充分展开宣传教育工作，广泛发动群众，并采取有效的技术措施，就一定能够克服一切困难，除尽四害，使群众养成讲卫生的习惯。
    现在，全国各省、市和自治区都争先恐后展开以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动了。原来开展较晚的黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、内蒙古自治区现在也迎头赶上来了。从最近的情况看来，十年内消灭四害和基本上消灭危害当地人民最严重的疾病的目标，是完全可以达到的。全党和全国人民的任务就是坚决执行党中央和国务院的指示，鼓足干劲，雷厉风行，按月按季检查督促，坚持到底，务必在今年内奠定消灭四害的巩固基础，并且争取在十年甚至更短的时间内在全中国除尽“四害”，使我国成为富强康乐的“四无”之邦。
