Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 2nd. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a provincial agricultural work conference and a telephone conference of secretaries of prefectural, county, and municipal Party committees, calling on the people of the province to find all means to accelerate the pace of socialist construction and strive to complete the requirements put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within five years.

At the agricultural work conference, twenty-five counties proposed to achieve a grain yield of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu in 1958. The conference also used a large number of facts to criticize the thinking of following old ways, being satisfied with the status quo, and lacking revolutionary drive. For example, areas with poor conditions and low yields emphasized difficulties, saying that they could not make a leap forward; areas with relatively good conditions and high yields believed that production had reached its peak and lacked confidence in further increasing production. Responsible comrades attending the meeting from the Gannan District said that the Gannan District is adjacent to Guangdong Province, and the conditions in all aspects are similar. The Chaozhou and Shantou areas of Guangdong have already seen many counties with 800 jin and 1,000 jin per mu, but the current yield per mu in the Gannan District is only 428 jin. This is not because the conditions in the Gannan District are too poor, but mainly because we have more right-leaning conservative thinking and less revolutionary drive. Comrades from the Shangrao Prefecture who attended the meeting selected three different areas in the district, namely lakeside, mountainous, and hilly areas, for comparative analysis. They believed that in the same area, some had increased production year after year, and some had decreased production year after year, and the key issue was whether there was a revolutionary drive. Many comrades also introduced examples of relying on the strength of the masses to develop agriculture and carry out agricultural capital construction, and criticized the idea of attempting to rely solely on state assistance to achieve a great leap forward.

After criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, various places put forward the goal of catching up in a great leap forward. According to the plans put forward by various counties at the meeting, among the eighty-two counties in the province, twenty-five counties proposed to achieve a grain yield of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu in 1958, seven counties to achieve 700 to 800 jin, and ten counties to achieve 600 to 700 jin. Other counties also put forward great leap forward targets. In terms of water conservancy and fertilizer, various places have also put forward great leap forward measures.

In order to adapt to this new situation, Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, put forward the requirements of speeding up and making an all-round leap forward, and striving to complete the ten-year plan in five years at the telephone conference on January 31. He said that it is entirely possible to achieve this great leap forward. In order to strive to complete the plan five years ahead of schedule, it is necessary to look at three years in five years, and look at the first year in three years, and it is necessary to ensure a great leap forward in agricultural production this year and strive for a bumper harvest. In 1958, the province's total grain output is required to reach 17.5 billion jin, an increase of 25% over 1957; the total cotton output is required to reach 650,000 dan, an increase of 46%; the total output of flax is required to reach 1.2 million dan, an increase of 110%; the total output of oils and fats is required to reach 210 million jin, an increase of 75%; the output of live pigs is required to reach 8 million heads, an increase of 80%; and other agricultural production indicators are required to be further ahead of the original plan.

Yang Shangkui put forward measures and methods on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee. He said that first of all, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work, continue to criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas, and let go of mobilizing the masses, so that the slogan of striving for a great leap forward in all aspects and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture becomes the actual action of millions of people. Secondly, the current plan is to increase and improve the irrigated area by 8 million mu, and it is required to increase another 2 million mu on this basis, reaching 10 million mu. For accumulating and making fertilizers, it is required to double the original plan of 2.5 billion dan, reaching 5 billion dan. In addition, it is necessary to vigorously promote various measures to increase production. Third, it is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of Party and government leading organs at all levels and Party grassroots organizations over the production movement, effectively improve leadership methods, and establish a work system of comprehensive planning, several inspections, and year-end evaluations.

Yang Shangkui said that local industry must also be actively developed, and strive to make the total output value of local industry in the province catch up with the total agricultural output value of the province within seven years. Transportation, commerce and trade, culture, education, and health, and other aspects of work, should also be organized for a comprehensive leap forward accordingly.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 2nd. According to the progress of the great leap forward in water conservancy construction and other aspects, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently changed the plan put forward in early December 1957 to achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in ten years, to be achieved in the next five to seven years.

Anhui Province is traversed by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. According to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program, half of the cultivated land belongs to the 500 jin area and half belongs to the 800 jin area. To complete this grain target, it is necessary to increase the province's grain output from the current 24 billion jin to 48.3 billion jin. At the Provincial Party Congress in early December 1957, it was requested that the province's grain output reach about 40 billion jin by 1962 and more than 50 billion jin by 1967. However, in just over a month after the Party Congress, the masses were greatly motivated, and the earthwork completed for water conservancy projects exceeded more than twice the original plan of 800 million cubic meters, and is striving towards the goal of more than 2 billion cubic meters. At the same time, the province's work on accumulating fertilizer, greening, and eliminating the four pests has also overfulfilled the original plan. According to this situation, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee further studied the issue of realizing the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and timely revised the original plan. By 1962, the province's grain output will be increased to about 51 billion jin, the yield per mu in the Huaibei area will be increased from the current 204 jin to 530 jin, and the yield per mu in the Huainan area will be increased from the current 397 jin to 841 jin.

At the conference of county-level and above Party committee secretaries at the end of January, Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, explained the basis and possibility of realizing the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule. He said that according to the current enthusiasm of the masses, 2 billion cubic meters of earthwork can be completed for water conservancy in one winter and spring (and may be exceeded). In the next four years, as long as there is a slight increase year by year, it is entirely possible to make the total amount of earthwork for water conservancy reach 12 billion cubic meters in five years. As long as this goal is achieved, the province can basically eliminate drought and flood disasters and can carry out production reforms on a large scale. In terms of fertilizer, more than double the original plan can be completed this winter and spring. In the next five years, continue to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses in accumulating fertilizer, and increase the area of ​​green manure for single and intercropping from the current 6 million mu to about 70 million mu, which can solve the fertilizer problem for more than 60 million mu of farmland. If the number of pigs raised per household increases from the current one and a half to three, and each pig supplies fertilizer for three mu of land, the pigs raised by more than 7 million households in the province can also supply the needs of fertilizer for more than 60 million mu of land. In addition, there are human manure, animal manure, soil fertilizer, and miscellaneous fertilizer. By 1962, the province's grain sown area will reach more than 140 million mu, and fine fertilizer can also be applied to most of it, and the production increase effect will be even greater. He said that now there are ways to solve the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer, and relying on the enthusiasm of the masses to build socialism has made it possible to quickly realize these methods. This is an important basis for realizing the grain target of the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule.

Comrade Zeng Xisheng went on to say that in the future, with the completion of the 12 billion cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects and with a large amount of fine fertilizer, Anhui will be able to make a great leap in production. At that time, the province will vigorously change to high-yield crops, realize dry land to paddy fields, increase the yield per unit area of ​​summer harvest crops, and expand the multiple cropping index. He said that among high-yield crops, greatly changing to rice is the most important way to increase production. Anhui currently has only more than 30 million mu of rice sown area. If double-cropping rice is planted on 10 million mu during the second five-year plan, and the area of ​​dry land converted to paddy fields reaches more than 20 million mu, the rice sown area can be increased by 30 million mu. The yield per mu is increased from the current 300 jin to 500 jin, and the province can achieve 31.9 billion jin of grain by this item alone. It is very possible to realize this item. Now the province has more than 3 million mu of double-cropping rice, which reached more than 7 million mu in 1956. After several years of planting by the masses and cadres, they have a foundation in ideology and technology. Expanding to 10 million mu in five years is not only possible but will greatly exceed it. Regarding the conversion of dry land to paddy fields, after the masses vigorously developed water conservancy, there are conditions for converting 20 million mu of rice in five years. For example, this year, the Huaibei area alone will convert more than 4 million mu, and at this rate, Huaibei can reach the requirements of the entire province in five years. He then pointed out that the requirements for the yield per unit area of ​​other high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and corn in the revised plan are not high. For example, sweet potatoes only require the average yield per unit area of ​​the province to be increased from the current 1,200 jin to 2,000 jin, and many places have already reached this yield. Among the summer harvest crops, the requirements for barley and wheat are only to increase from the current 110 jin to 200 jin, and last year, millions of mu of wheat in Huaibei had already averaged more than 250 jin. The grain multiple cropping index has now been increased to 170% in the province, and only 200% is required to achieve the revised plan, which is not too high.

Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that the conditions for realizing the Agricultural Development Program in five years are fully available, but it is necessary to work hard in a down-to-earth manner with a revolutionary spirit to turn the possible into reality. He believes that the most important of these tasks is to strive to grasp the solution to the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer. He called on Party committees at all levels to lead the masses to give play to greater initiative and creativity, use their brains to think of more ways, and strive to be self-reliant. For example, for fertilizer, we must never wait for the state to supply chemical fertilizers, and we must achieve the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program even without chemical fertilizers. He demanded that according to this revolutionary spirit, and according to the greatly increased conditions of water conservancy and fertilizer, townships and societies should re-discuss and revise their plans to push production to a higher level.

　　力争上游的农业生产大跃进计划
    江西安徽决定十年指标五年实现
    本报特约新华社南昌2日电　中共江西省委最近召开了全省农业工作会议和全省地、县、市委书记电话会议，号召全省人民想一切办法加快社会主义建设的速度，争取在五年之内完成全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所提出的要求。
    在农业工作会议上，有二十五个县提出1958年粮食单位面积产量要达到八百斤到一千斤。这次会议还用大量的事实批判了因循守旧，满足现状和缺乏革命干劲的思想。例如：条件差、产量低的地区，有的强调困难，说不能跃进；条件比较好、产量比较高的地区，有的则认为增产到了顶，对再增产缺乏信心。赣南区出席会议的负责同志说，赣南区与广东省毗邻，各方面的条件相差不多。广东的潮州、汕头地区已出现了不少八百斤、一千斤的县，但赣南区现在单位面积产量仅四百二十八斤。这并不是由于赣南区的条件太差，主要是我们多了一个右倾保守思想，少了一个革命干劲。上饶专区参加会议的同志选择了本区滨湖、山区、丘陵三种不同地区进行对比分析，认为同样的地区，有的连年增产，有的连年减产，关键问题也在于有没有一股革命干劲。许多同志在会上还介绍了依靠群众力量来发展农业、进行农业基本建设的事例，批判那些企图单纯依赖国家帮助来实现大跃进的思想。
    在批判了右倾保守思想之后，各地提出了迎头赶上的大跃进目标。据各县在会议上提出来的计划，全省八十二个县中，有二十五个县提出1958年粮食单位面积产量达到八百斤到一千斤，有七个县达到七百斤到八百斤，有十个县达到六百斤到七百斤。其他的县也提出了大跃进的指标。在水利、肥料等方面，各地也都提出了大跃进的措施。
    为了适应这一新形势，省委第一书记杨尚奎在1月31日电话会议上提出快马加鞭全面跃进、十年规划争取五年完成的要求。他说，实现这个大跃进是完全可能的。为了争取提早五年实现规划，需要五年看三年，三年看头年，必须保证今年的农业生产大跃进，争取大丰收。1958年要求全省粮食总产量达到一百七十五亿斤，比1957年增产25％；棉花总产量达到六十五万担，增产46％；麻类总产量达到一百二十万担，增产110％；油脂总产量达到二亿一千万斤，增产75％；生猪产量达到八百万头，增产80％；其他各项农业生产指标都要求比原定计划更加前进一步。
    杨尚奎代表省委提出了措施和办法。他说，首先必须加强政治思想工作，继续批判各种右倾保守思想，放手发动群众，使全面大跃进争取农业大丰收的口号成为千百万群众的实际行动。其次，目前各地计划增加和改善灌溉面积为八百万亩，要求在这个基础上再增加二百万亩，达到一千万亩。积肥造肥，要求在原定二十五亿担计划的基础上再增加一倍，达到五十亿担。此外要大力推行各项增产措施。第三，必须进一步加强各级党政领导机关和党的基层组织对生产运动的领导，切实改进领导方法，建立全面规划、几次检查、年终评比的工作制度。
    杨尚奎说，地方工业也必须积极发展，争取全省地方工业的总产值在七年内赶上全省农业总产值。交通运输、商业贸易、文教卫生等各方面的工作，都要相应地组织全面跃进。
    本报合肥2日电　中共安徽省委根据在兴修水利等方面大跃进的进展情况，最近又把1957年12月初提出的全省十年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指标的计划，改为要在今后五年到七年内实现。
    安徽省境内江淮横贯，按照全国农业发展纲要的规定，有一半耕地属于五百斤地区，有一半属于八百斤地区，要完成这个粮食指标，就需要把全省粮食产量，由现在的二百四十亿斤提高到四百八十三亿斤。1957年12月初省党代会上，曾要求全省粮食产量到1962年达到四百亿斤左右，到1967年达到五百亿斤以上。但是，在党代会以后的短短一个多月的时间内，群众鼓足了极大的干劲，完成的水利工程土方，超过原订计划八亿公方的一倍以上，并正在向二十多亿方的目标努力。与此同时，全省积肥、绿化、除四害等的工作，也都超额完成了原订计划。安徽省委根据这种情况，对全省提前实现全国农业发展纲要指标的问题进一步做了研究，并及时地修订了原计划，到1962年就要把全省粮食产量提高到五百一十亿斤左右，淮北地区亩产由现在的二百零四斤多提高到五百三十斤，淮南地区亩产由现在的三百九十七斤多提高到八百四十一斤多。
    中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志1月底在县以上党委书记会议上，对提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要指标的根据及可能性作了说明。他说，根据目前群众的干劲，一个冬春即兴修水利二十亿土方（还可能超过），在以后四年多的时间内，只要逐年稍有增加，五年内完全有可能使兴修水利的土方总数达到一百二十亿公方。只要达到这个目标，全省便可基本消灭旱涝灾害，便可大规模实行生产改革。在肥料方面，去冬今春可完成原计划的一倍以上。今后五年继续发挥群众积肥的积极性，把单种套种的绿肥面积由现在的六百万亩增加到七千万亩左右，即可解决六千多万亩田地的肥料问题。如果每户养猪由现在的一头半增加到三头，每头猪供应三亩地施肥，全省七百多万户农户所养的猪，也可供应六千多万亩土地施肥的需要。此外，还有人粪、畜粪、土肥、杂肥等。全省粮食播种面积到1962年将达到一亿四千多万亩，还可大部施用细肥，增产效果更大。他说，现在有了解决水利、肥料问题的办法，依靠群众建设社会主义的干劲，使这些办法又有了迅速实现的可能，这就是要提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要上粮食指标的重要根据。
    曾希圣同志接着谈到，将来在完成一百二十亿土方的水利工程和有了大量细肥的情况下，安徽在生产上便有可能大大跃进了。那时，全省将大力改种高产作物，实现旱地改水田，提高夏收作物的单位产量以及扩大复种指数等。他说，在高产作物中，大量改种水稻，是提高生产量最重要的办法。安徽现在的水稻播种面积只有三千多万亩，如果在第二个五年计划期间把双季稻种植到一千万亩，旱地改为水田的面积达到二千多万亩，即可增加三千万亩的水稻播种面积，每亩产量由现在的三百斤提高到五百斤，全省单这一项即可达到三百一十九亿斤粮食。而实现这一项是很有可能的。现在全省已有三百多万亩双季稻，1956年曾达到七百多万亩，群众和干部经过几年来的种植，在思想上和技术上已都有了基础，五年内扩大到一千万亩不但可能而且将会大大超过。关于旱地改水田，经过群众大兴水利，五年改种二千多万亩水稻也有了条件，如今年只是淮北地区就要改种四百多万亩，按这个速度，淮北五年就可达到全省的要求了。他接着指出修订计划中对其他高产作物如红薯、玉米的单位面积产量的要求也是不高的，如红薯只要求全省平均单位面积产量由现在的一千二百斤提高到二千斤，而现在达到这一产量的地方已经很多。在夏收作物中，如对大麦小麦的要求，也只是由现在的一百一十多斤提高到二百斤，而去年淮北有成百万亩小麦已平均达到二百五十斤以上了。粮食复种指数现在全省已提高到170％，而在实现修订的计划时，只要求达到200％，这个要求也不算很高。
    曾希圣同志说，五年实现农业发展纲要的条件是完全具备了，但是，要用革命的精神，踏踏实实地工作，才能把可能变为现实。他认为这些工作中最重要的，还是努力抓紧解决水利和肥料的问题。他号召各级党委领导群众发挥更大的积极性和创造性，开动脑筋多想办法，力求自力更生，如肥料，绝不能等待国家供应化学肥料，要做到就是没有化学肥料，也能实现全国农业发展纲要的要求。他要求根据这种革命精神，根据大大增加了的水利、肥料等条件，乡乡社社都重新讨论修订自己的计划，把生产推向更高潮。
