Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, February 15th (TASS): Thai public opinion has expressed praise for the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies' gift of the latest medicines for treating cancer to the Thai Red Cross. “Picture News,” “Daily Mail,” and other newspapers have pointed out that this valuable gift is good evidence that consolidating and expanding Soviet-Thai relations is possible and beneficial.

“Picture News” wrote on February 15th, referring to recent news about the United States' intention to transport rocket and atomic weapons to Thailand, "Every Thai person now sees which camp provides truly beneficial assistance to the people and which camp is truly willing to ease international tensions and strengthen friendship between the people of all countries." The newspaper emphasized that the United States' attempt to force Thailand to accept rocket and atomic weapons conceals a direct threat not only to the Thai people but also to all peace-loving people of all countries.

    泰国舆论赞扬苏联赠药
    新华社讯　塔斯社曼谷15日电：泰国舆论对苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会赠给泰国红十字会治疗癌症的最新药品一事表示赞扬。“图画新闻”、“每日邮报”以及其他报纸都指出，这一宝贵的赠品很好地证明，巩固和扩大苏泰两国关系是可能的，也是有益的。
    “图画新闻”15日在谈到最近的关于美国打算把火箭武器和原子武器运往泰国的消息时写道，“每个泰国人现在都看到，在两个阵营中，哪一个阵营提供对人民真正有利的帮助，哪一个阵营真正愿意缓和国际紧张局势和加强各国人民间的友谊。”这家报纸着重指出，美国想迫使泰国接受火箭武器和原子武器的企图，隐藏着不仅是对泰国人民，而且是对各国爱好和平人民的直接威胁。
