　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd - General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Gollan, spoke at a Communist Party meeting in Bradford today, calling on the British people to oppose the government's allowing the United States to establish missile bases in Britain.
    He said that Britain's fate is being decided by secret negotiations currently underway in Washington, without consulting the British people. He denounced the government's actions as treasonous. Gollan said that Prime Minister Macmillan and Defense Minister Sandys hope to sign an agreement this month to provide British bases for American nuclear rockets, presenting Parliament with a fait accompli. Their aim is to have the American rockets set up before Christmas. And in order to enjoy the "glory" of being an American front line for nuclear suicide, the British people must pay 30 million pounds.
    He said: "It is said that the important clause in the agreement regarding who has the right to launch the rockets will be kept secret. This can only mean that the decision-making power is in the hands of the United States, in the hands of cold war fanatics like Dulles."
    Gollan pointed out that the government must not be allowed to conclude this agreement, which is related to the fate of the British people. He said: "Now, while the agreement has not yet been concluded, the whole issue should be brought to Parliament for debate. Resolutions and telegrams should be used to show Parliament and the government that British workers refuse to establish rocket bases. The time has come to tell the Americans to get out."

　　高兰号召英国人民及早行动  不许政府让美国设导弹基地
    新华社伦敦3日电　英国共产党总书记高兰今天在布莱德福的共产党会议上讲话时号召英国人民反对政府允许美国在英国建立导弹基地。
    他说，英国的命运正由目前在华盛顿举行的秘密谈判决定，而不同英国人民商量。他斥责政府的这种行动是叛国行为。高兰说，首相麦克米伦和国防大臣桑迪斯希望在这个月签订为美国核火箭提供英国基地的协定，使议会面对既成事实。他们的目的是在圣诞节以前设置好美国火箭。而为了享受作为原子核自杀的美国前线的“光荣”，英国人民就必须支付三千万英镑。
    他说：“据说，协定中关于谁有权发射火箭的重要条款将是保密的。这只能意味着这个决定权是操在美国手中，操在杜勒斯这样的冷战狂人手中。”
    高兰指出，绝不能允许政府缔结这个同英国人民命运攸关的协定。他说：“现在趁着协定还没有缔结，应该把整个问题拿到议会中进行辩论。应当用决议和电报向议会和政府表明，英国工人拒绝建立火箭基地。要美国人滚蛋的时候已经到了。”
