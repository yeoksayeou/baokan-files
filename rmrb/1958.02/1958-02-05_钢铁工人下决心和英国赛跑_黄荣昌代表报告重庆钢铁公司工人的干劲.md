Steelworkers Determined to Race Britain
Representative Huang Rongchang Reports the Drive of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Workers

　　I wholeheartedly support all the reports of the congress, especially the handling of the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists, which I firmly endorse. My fellow workers at our factory were particularly happy that I came to Beijing to attend the congress, and everyone wanted me to bring their heartfelt words to Chairman Mao. Now, I will report to the congress on the completion of the first Five-Year Plan of our Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and the drive of our workers to race Britain.

　　Completed Five-Year Plan Eleven Months Ahead of Schedule; Made Eighty New Products to Support the Whole Country

　　During the first Five-Year Plan, the worker comrades in our factory, like the rest of the country, worked hard in production entirely according to the words of the Party and Chairman Mao. We did a great job and achieved great results. We completed the first Five-Year Plan eleven months ahead of schedule. Compared with 1952, the total output value and the production of various major products increased significantly in 1957. The total output value more than doubled, steel output increased nearly tenfold, and steel products also increased more than twofold. Our production development speed is very fast. Steel production in our company increased more than twenty-three times in the eight years after liberation compared with the eight years before liberation. If we take the average annual growth rate of steel production in this factory from 1941 to 1949, the eight years before liberation, which was 25.4 percent, it would take two hundred and sixty-six years to reach our current level.

　　In the past five years, we have successfully trial-produced eighty new products, which have supported key construction projects in twenty-seven provinces and autonomous regions across the country, and also supported Vietnam and North Korea. Some products have also been sold to India and Pakistan.

　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese working class has shown its great skills and done an outstanding job. We have made high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. This is something that capitalist countries could only dream of. The Yangtze River Bridge is made of the bridge steel rolled by us. The steel rails rolled by us have been laid on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and now they have been laid out of Sichuan and over the Qinling Mountains. The Shu Road is no longer difficult, and transportation in Sichuan is now accessible in all directions. Now, every road leads to Beijing, and every road leads to great socialism.

　　Our dear Chairman Mao taught us: We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before. Although we have encountered many difficulties in production, when we encounter difficulties, we are filled with energy and fear nothing when we think of this sentence taught to us by our dear Chairman Mao. Every one of our employees is diligent, thrifty, hardworking, and loves the factory as their home, and always keeps increasing production and practicing economy in mind. We want to do more things in less time and build our country into a great socialist industrialized power like the Soviet Union as soon as possible. We are determined to realize this ideal. Our working class has an iron will, and no force can stop us from moving forward!

　　Put in More Effort and Keep Going; We Will Definitely Leave Britain Far Behind

　　Now, the Party has put forward the great call to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture in about fifteen years, and to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in the next fifteen years or a little longer. This has given us great encouragement. All our employees are determined to race against Britain, determined to catch up with Britain, and determined to run ahead of it. We unanimously put forward the guarantee: to give full play to revolutionary enthusiasm, muster revolutionary vigor, and set off a production upsurge. Every one of our comrades is very clear that, judging from the speed of our production development in the past few years, if we put in more effort and keep going, we will definitely be able to catch up with Britain and definitely be able to leave Britain far behind!

　　Bring Out the Greatest Energy to Set Off a Production Upsurge; New Records Appear One After Another

　　At present, our Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has already set off a production upsurge. Everyone has brought out their greatest energy and happily welcomed the tasks of the second Five-Year Plan. In September last year, we compiled a production plan for 1958 based on the production situation in the first three quarters: steel increased by 5.2 percent compared with 1957, but steel products decreased by 2.9 percent. However, after socialist education and the rectification movement, the enthusiasm of employees for production has greatly increased, and the production level has risen rapidly in the production upsurge. Rationalization proposals are made every day, and new records appear one after another. In the fourth quarter alone, 800 rationalization proposals were made, and nearly 300 new records were created in the five workshops of steelmaking, steel rolling, and ironmaking alone. Based on this situation, at the beginning of the year, we also set new targets for increasing steel and steel products by 35,600 tons and increasing the total output value by 9.95 million yuan. Under the leadership of the Party, a large-scale debate on promoting a great leap forward in production in 1958 is now being carried out among all employees, and a struggle against conservatism and waste is being launched. Everyone's enthusiasm is getting higher and higher, their energy is getting greater and greater, and new records are increasing. In early January, the company leadership decided to increase the production of steel and steel products by another 14,000 tons. At this moment, the company's trade union convened a conference of advanced producers for 1957 and the fourth quarter of this year. More than 1,000 advanced producers came to a grand gathering. After listening to the report of the Party Committee Secretary, they further clarified the current situation, clarified their tasks, and had more confidence and greater energy. All advanced producers resolutely swore an oath to march towards the second Five-Year Plan and unanimously passed the "Guarantee Letter Responding to the Proposal of the Employees of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant." After the advanced producers returned to the workshops, they and the worker brothers set off a wave of "finding advanced, comparing with advanced, learning from advanced, and catching up with advanced." Everyone made guarantees, everyone strived to be advanced, and the atmosphere was very lively. When the leadership handed over the various indicators of the third production plan increase to our workers for discussion, the appearance was completely new. After everyone calculated carefully and tapped potential, they put forward more advanced indicators. Take our small open hearth furnace workshop as an example. Originally, the life of each open hearth furnace was generally about 300 heats. In early January, a new record of 500 furnace life was created. The worker brothers immediately proposed to march towards the national record of 599 heats. Now it has broken through 600 heats and is advancing towards 650 heats. The steelmaking workers also proposed to resolutely learn from advanced factories and mines across the country, the quality should catch up with Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1, and they guarantee to refine 20,000 tons of high-quality steel, and the refining furnace rate should reach and exceed the level of Tianjin Steel Plate Factory, and also guarantee that the smelting time of each furnace of steel will be shortened by another sixteen minutes compared to the plan. The workers in the steel rolling workshop launched the "400-minute steel rolling competition per shift" in early January, striving to shorten non-production time as much as possible. Now, the actual production time per shift has reached 450 minutes. Some shifts have already created a record of 465 minutes, which is 65 minutes shorter than the originally planned competition plan per shift, and they guarantee to roll more high-quality steel products such as boiler steel plates and bridge steel that are urgently needed for our country's construction. The daily output of sintered ore in our ironmaking workshop at the beginning of the year was 40 to 50 pots. After the workers discussed it, they immediately proposed a guarantee of 72 pots per day. At the same time, the company recently held a meeting of technical personnel, and more than 300 technical personnel debated and discussed issues such as "whether we can catch up with Britain in about fifteen years" and "how to promote a great leap forward in production in 1958." They criticized conservative thinking, and everyone had great ambition and determination. They all made up their minds and guaranteed to be a "both red and expert" technical personnel. From these situations, it can be seen that the figure of increasing steel and steel products by 49,600 tons on the basis of the original plan is still relatively conservative. As long as we tap the potential well, we can still increase steel and steel products by another 25,000 tons. In this way, this year's steel output will actually increase by 17.86 percent compared with 1957, steel products will increase by 11.71 percent, the total output value will actually increase by 8.5 percent, labor productivity will increase by 10.52 percent, and the cost will decrease by 7.2 percent compared with 1957.

　　The great call of the Party Central Committee, the education of the rectification movement, the publication of the two Moscow declarations, and the encouragement of the development speed of the first Five-Year Plan have given all our employees a hundredfold confidence and full energy. This year, our production will surely have a great leap forward, and we will surely be able to complete the task more, better, faster, and more economically ahead of schedule. Of course, there are difficulties in front of us, but we will never be arrogant and complacent. Our working class has never been complacent. Under the leadership of the Party, we will unite and work hard together. We will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and catch up with Britain in about fifteen years and build our country into a great socialist power as soon as possible.

　　钢铁工人下决心和英国赛跑
    黄荣昌代表报告重庆钢铁公司工人的干劲
    我衷心拥护大会的各项报告，特别是对反党、反人民、反社会主义资产阶级右派分子的处理，我坚决拥护。我这次到北京来开会，我们工厂的职工同志特别高兴，大家都要我把心里的话带给毛主席。现在，我把我们重庆钢铁公司第一个五年计划的完成情况和大家怎样下决心和英国赛跑的劲头向大会汇报一下。
    提前十一个月完成五年计划  制成八十种新产品支援全国
    在第一个五年计划里，我们工厂的工人兄弟和全国一样完全按照党和毛主席的话加劲生产，我们干得很好，成绩很大。我们提前十一个月完成了第一个五年计划。生产总值和各种主要产品的生产，一九五七年和一九五二年比较，生产总值增加了一倍多，钢产量将近增加十倍，钢材也增加了两倍多。我们生产的发展速度是很快的。我们公司解放后八年钢的产量和解放前八年比较，钢就增加了二十三倍多。如拿解放以前这个厂一九四一年到一九四九年八年中钢生产每年的平均增长速度为百分之二十五点四来计算，要二百六十六年才能达到我们现在的水平。
    五年来，我们试制成功了八十种新产品，这些新产品支援了全国二十七个省和自治区的重点工程建设，还支援了越南，支援了朝鲜；有的产品还运销到了印度和巴基斯坦。
    在共产党领导下的中国工人阶级，大显身手，干得很出色。我们使高山低了头，河水让了路，这是资本主义国家做梦也想不到的。在长江大桥上，有我们轧出来的桥梁钢；我们轧出来的钢轨铺好了成渝铁路，现在已经铺出四川，铺过了秦岭，蜀道从此不再难了，四川的交通运输四通八达。现在是条条道路通北京，条条道路通向伟大的社会主义。
    亲爱的毛主席教导我们说：我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。虽然在生产中我们曾经撞到过许多困难，但是，当我们遇到困难的时候，一想起亲爱的毛主席教导我们的这一句话，全身都是干劲，什么困难都不怕。我们每一个职工同志都勤俭耐劳，爱厂如家，时时刻刻都把增产节约记在心上。我们要用很少的时间做更多的事情，早日把祖国建设成像苏联那样一个伟大的社会主义工业化的强国。我们坚决要实现这个理想，我们工人阶级有钢铁般的决心，任何力量也阻挡不了我们前进！
    再努一把力一股劲干下去  一定把英国远远抛在后面
    现在，我们的党提出了十五年左右把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，在今后十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的伟大号召，又给了我们很大的鼓舞。我们全体职工立志表示要和英国赛跑，坚决赶上英国，决心跑在它的前头。一致提出保证：要充分发挥革命的积极性，鼓足革命干劲，掀起生产高潮。我们每一个同志都很清楚，从我们几年来生产发展的速度来看，再努一把力，一股劲干下去，我们就一定能够赶上英国，一定能把英国远远地甩在后面！
    拿出最大劲头掀起生产高潮  新纪录一个紧接着一个出现
    目前，我们重庆钢铁公司已经掀起了生产高潮，大家拿出了最大的劲头，欢天喜地迎接了第二个五年计划的任务。去年九月份，我们曾根据前三个季度的生产情况，编制了一个一九五八年的生产计划：钢比一九五七年增长百分之五点二，钢材却减少百分之二点九。可是，经过社会主义教育和整风运动，职工生产的积极性大大提高，在生产高潮中生产水平上升得很快，合理化建议天天都有，新纪录一个接一个，第四季度就提出了合理化建议八百件，单是炼钢、轧钢、炼铁等五个车间，就创造了近三百个新纪录。根据这个情况，年初，我们又订出了再增产钢和钢材三万五千六百吨，增加生产总值九百九十五万元的新指标。在党的领导下，现在正在全体职工中进行促进一九五八年生产大跃进的大辩论，开展反保守和反浪费的斗争。大家的热情越来越高，劲头越来越大，新纪录越来越多。一月上旬，公司领导上决定再增产一万四千吨钢和钢材。正当这个时候，公司工会召开了一九五七年度和这一年第四季度先进生产者大会，一千多个先进生产者来了个大会师，他们听了党委书记的报告，更进一步认清了目前的形势，更加明确了自己的任务，信心百倍，劲头更高。全体先进生产者坚决誓师向第二个五年计划大进军，并一致通过了“响应石景山钢铁厂职工倡议的保证书”。先进生产者回到车间以后，和工人兄弟一起掀起了“找先进、比先进、学先进、赶先进”的热潮，人人提保证，个个争先进，搞得热火朝天。当领导上把第三次提高生产计划的各项指标交给我们工人一讨论，面貌全新。经过大家算细账，挖潜力，又提出了更先进的指标。就拿我们的小平炉车间来说，原来每届平炉的寿命一般是三百炉左右，一月上旬就创造了炉龄五百炉的新纪录，工人兄弟就马上提出向全国最高纪录五百九十九炉进军，现在已经突破了六百炉，正向六百五十炉猛进。炼钢工人还提出要坚决向全国各先进厂矿学习，质量要赶上上海钢铁一厂，并且保证炼出两万吨优质钢，炼炉率要达到并超过天津钢板厂的水平，还保证把每炉钢的冶炼时间比计划再缩短十六分钟。轧钢车间的工人在一月上旬开展了“每一班四百分钟轧钢竞赛”，力争尽量缩短非生产时间。现在，每班的生产时间实际上已达到四百五十分钟。有的班已经创了四百六十五分钟的最高纪录，就比原订竞赛计划每班的非生产时间更缩短了六十五分钟，并且他们保证要轧制出更多的我国建设急需的锅炉钢板和桥梁钢等优质钢材，我们炼铁车间的烧结矿年初的日产量是四十到五十锅，经过工人讨论，马上又提出日产七十二锅的保证。同时，公司最近还召开了技术人员会议，三百多名技术人员对“十五年左右能不能赶上英国”和“怎样来促进一九五八年生产大跃进”等问题展开了争辩，进行了讨论。他们批判了保守思想，个个志大劲足，都下定了决心，保证要作一个“又红又专”的技术人员。从这些情况可以看出，在原计划的基础上增产钢和钢材四万九千六百吨的数字仍然是比较保守的，只要我们好好的挖掘潜力，我们还可以再增产二万五千吨钢和钢材。这样，今年钢的产量就比一九五七年实际提高百分之十七点八六，钢材提高百分之十一点七一，生产总值实际提高百分之八点五，劳动生产率提高百分之十点五二，成本比一九五七年降低百分之七点二。
    党中央的伟大号召，整风运动的教育，莫斯科两个宣言的发表，第一个五年计划发展速度的鼓舞，我们全体职工信心百倍，干劲十足。今年我们的生产一定会来一个大跃进，一定能够更多更好更快更省地提前完成任务。当然，在我们面前也并不是没有困难的，但我们决不骄傲自满，我们工人阶级从来也没有自满过。在党的领导下，我们团结一致地一股劲干下去，我们一定能够战胜一切困难，在十五年左右赶过英国，早日把祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国。
