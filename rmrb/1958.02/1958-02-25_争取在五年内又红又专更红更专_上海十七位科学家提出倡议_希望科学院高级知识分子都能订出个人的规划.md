Strive to be Both Red and Expert, Even Redder and More Expert in Five Years
Seventeen Shanghai Scientists Put Forward a Proposal
Hoping that All Senior Intellectuals of the Academy of Sciences Can Make Personal Plans
Everyone Strives, Plans Individually
Mutual Assistance Usually, Annual Evaluation
Move Steadily to the Left, Strive for Complete Redness
    (Reported by the Shanghai Jiefang Daily) Seventeen scientists from natural science research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai have proposed to all senior intellectuals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: to be determined to be leftists and strive to become scientific workers who are both Red and expert, even Redder and more expert, within five years. Their proposal is as follows:
    In today's great leap forward in socialist construction, we, the workers engaged in natural science research, are deeply encouraged. We are determined to be leftists. Not only leftists in political life, but also leftists in scientific research, and leftists in lifestyle. We must guide science with dialectical materialism, and we must treat life with a communist worldview. Now, according to Comrade Ke Qingshi's five goals for intellectuals to gradually achieve through self-education and self-reform in "Riding the Waves and Accelerating the Construction of a New Socialist Shanghai," combined with the characteristics of natural science workers, we have formulated our own goals for effort and struggle to respond to the Party's call to transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals as soon as possible.
    1. Support the leadership of the Party. Fully trust the leadership of the Party politically, wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Party in scientific research activities, and resolutely implement the Party's policies and national scientific plans related to scientific undertakings.
    2. Firmly and actively take the socialist road. Politically, resolutely support the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In scientific research, we also firmly take the socialist road—scientific research serves socialist construction; conduct scientific research in an organized and planned manner in conjunction with national plans; give play to collective strength and develop contact and cooperation; and establish a thrifty style.
    3. Gradually integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, first establishing a correct labor view—valuing physical labor and respecting the labor of others, strengthening the mass viewpoint—going deep among the masses, believing in the power of the masses, and then truly integrating with the broad masses of workers and peasants emotionally.
    4. Correctly handle the contradictions between personal interests and collective interests, and national interests. Always consider the country and society first, then the individual, the whole before the part. Achieve obedience to national allocation, not emphasizing personal interests or ideals, never regarding research results as personal property, and abide by all national rules and regulations in scientific undertakings. Be accustomed to democratic centralism, being able to adhere to the truth and correct mistakes in a timely manner.
    5. Strive to study politics, actively delve into professional work, and constantly demand progress. Have a clear working-class position politically, and gradually establish the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism in thought. Be both energetic and innovative in business, and have a practical style. Implement political gains in business, and bring the spirit of rectification and the atmosphere of criticism to academic activities.
    If everyone strives towards the above goals, we believe that all senior intellectuals in the Shanghai natural science units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences can realize the Party's call, and leftists and middle-leftists can account for more than 60% in five years.
    Our slogans are: Everyone strives, plans individually, mutual assistance usually, annual evaluation, move steadily to the left, strive for complete redness.
    We propose to all senior intellectuals of our Academy that they can express their determination based on the above goals, combined with their own specific circumstances, and formulate and publicize their initial plans, clarify their specific goals of struggle (which can be further revised through the fourth stage of rectification), and formulate an overall plan on this basis as soon as possible. In this way, through personal efforts, organizational assistance, and mass supervision, closely combining politics and business, and cooperating with the great development of industrial and agricultural production, we can transform ourselves, improve ourselves, and strive to become working-class intellectuals who are both Red and expert in the current great leap forward in socialist science and culture.
    Proposers: Wang Yinglai, Zhu Xian, Wang You, Shen Shanjiong
            Li Lin, Zhou Ren, Luo Zongluo, Yang Pinglan
            Zhao Chenggu, Zhuang Xiaohui, Yin Hongzhang, Gao Yisheng
            Yao Xin, Feng Depei, Tang Yuwei, Cai Runsheng

    争取在五年内又红又专更红更专
    上海十七位科学家提出倡议
    希望科学院高级知识分子都能订出个人的规划
    人人争取  各自规划
    平时互助  年终评比
    步步向左  力求红透
    本报讯　上海解放日报消息：中国科学院在上海的自然科学研究机构的十七位科学家，向中国科学院全体高级知识分子提出倡议：下决心做左派，争取在五年内成为又红又专、更红更专的科学工作者。他们的倡议书如下：
    在今日社会主义建设的大跃进中，我们从事自然科学研究的工作者，深受鼓舞。我们有决心要做左派。不仅在政治生活中是左派，在科学研究中也是左派，在生活作风上也是左派。我们要以辩证唯物主义思想指导科学，我们要以共产主义人生观对待生活。现在根据柯庆施同志在“乘风破浪，加速建设社会主义的新上海”中提出的知识分子通过自我教育、自我改造的途径要逐步达到的五项目标，我们结合了自然科学工作者的特点，拟订了自己努力与奋斗的目标，来响应党的号召，要尽快地把自己改造成为工人阶级知识分子。
    一、拥护党的领导。在政治上完全信任党的领导，在科学研究活动上也衷心接受党的领导，坚决执行党所制订的有关科学事业的方针政策和国家的科学规划。
    二、坚定地积极地走社会主义道路。在政治上坚决拥护社会主义制度和无产阶级专政。在科学研究上也坚定地走社会主义道路——科学研究为社会主义建设服务；结合国家计划来有组织有计划地进行科学研究；发挥集体力量，开展联系合作；树立勤俭作风。
    三、逐步同工农兵打成一片，首先树立正确的劳动观点——重视体力劳动和尊重别人的劳动，加强群众观点——深入群众，相信群众的力量，进而和广大工人农民真正地在感情上打成一片。
    四、正确处理个人利益同集体利益、国家利益的矛盾。凡事先考虑国家、社会，后考虑个人，先整体后局部。做到服从国家调配，不强调个人兴趣或理想，决不把研究成果视为个人私有，遵守国家在科学事业上的一切规章制度。习惯于民主集中制，既能坚持真理，又能及时修正错误。
    五、努力学习政治，积极钻研业务，不断要求进步，在政治上有鲜明的工人阶级立场，在思想上逐渐树立辩证唯物主义的观点与方法。业务上既富有干劲和革新精神，同时有踏实的作风。把政治上的收获贯彻到业务中去，把整风的精神、批评的风气带到学术活动中去。
    如果大家都向以上目标努力，我们相信，在中国科学院沪区各自然科学单位中的全体高级知识分子能够实现党的号召，在五年之中，左派和中左分子能占60％以上。
    我们的口号是：人人争取、各自规划、平时互助、年终评比、步步向左、力求红透。
    我们向我院全体高级知识分子倡议，都能根据以上目标，表示决心，结合本人具体情况，订出并公布自己的初步规划，明确自己的具体奋斗目标（通过整风第四阶段，尚可进一步修正），尽快地在这一基础上制订出一个总的规划。这样，经过个人努力，组织帮助，群众监督，把政治与业务密切结合，配合工农业生产大发展，在当前社会主义科学文化事业大跃进中改造自己、提高自己，争取早日成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    倡议人：王应睐　朱冼　汪猷　沈善炯
            李林　周仁　罗宗洛　杨平澜
            赵承嘏　庄孝僡　殷宏章　高怡生
            姚鑫　冯德培　汤玉玮　蔡润生
            鲁子惠（姓名以姓氏笔划为序）
                      一九五八年二月二十日
