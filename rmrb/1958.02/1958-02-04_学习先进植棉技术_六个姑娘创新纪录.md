    Learning Advanced Cotton Planting Techniques
    Six Girls Create a New Record
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, February 2nd. A cotton planting group composed of six girls from the No. 21 Farm in the Manas River Basin Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps achieved a high-yield record last year. The 62.3 mu of cotton fields they managed produced an average of 727.8 jin of seed cotton per mu, with 1.8 mu averaging 1,467.3 jin per mu. This created the highest unit area yield record for Xinjiang cotton in 1957, exceeding the high-yield record of 1,392 jin of seed cotton per mu set by the nationally renowned cotton planting expert Liu Xuefo in 1955 by 75 jin; it was 219.16 jin less than the national high-yield record of the Xue Zhanchun group in 1956.
    This cotton planting group consists of six people. The group leader, Yu Aihua, and four others are young girls who came from Henan to Xinjiang in 1956 to participate in border construction. One is a family member of a farm worker. They do not have much experience in cotton planting, but because they conscientiously studied the cotton high-yield experience of Liu Xuefo and others, promoted advanced Soviet cotton planting techniques, adopted improved Soviet varieties, and carried out a series of intensive farming practices such as reasonable close planting and frequent soil loosening, they achieved a high yield of cotton.

    学习先进植棉技术
    六个姑娘创新纪录
    据新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　新疆军区农业生产建设部队玛纳斯河流域垦区二一农场，一个由六个姑娘组成的植棉小组去年获得了高额丰产纪录，她们管理的六十二点三亩棉田，平均每亩产籽棉七百二十七点八斤，其中一点八亩平均每亩产量为一千四百六十七点三斤，创造了1957年新疆棉花单位面积产量最高纪录，比全国著名植棉能手刘学佛1955年创造亩产籽棉一千三百九十二斤的丰产纪录高出七十五斤；比薛占春小组1956年的全国丰产最高纪录差二百一十九点一六斤。
    这个植棉小组共六个人，组长于爱花和其他四个人都是1956年从河南到新疆参加边疆建设的年轻姑娘，还有一个是农场职工家属。她们植棉经验不多，但由于认真地学习了刘学佛等人的棉花丰产经验，推行了苏联先进植棉技术，采用苏联良种，并进行合理密植和勤松土等一系列精耕细作，因而得到棉花丰产。（附图片）
