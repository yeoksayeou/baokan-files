Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Highway transportation workers in China are about to launch a nationwide movement for "Safety, Economy, 200,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul." This was stated in an important resolution passed today at the Second National Congress of the Chinese Highway Transportation Trade Union.

During the discussion of future tasks, the representatives believed that in addition to excellently completing the state's highway transportation tasks during the Second Five-Year Plan to support the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, a very important task for highway transportation workers is to leap forward on the basis of the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" movement and launch a nationwide movement for "Safety, Economy, 200,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul." This is the most practical and effective action for highway transportation workers to concretely implement the policy of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift. In 1955, highway transportation departments in China overhauled vehicles on average every 54,000 kilometers. After the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" movement was launched in 1956, in 1957, more than 7,800 vehicles nationwide exceeded 100,000 kilometers without major overhaul; more than 380 vehicles exceeded 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul; and the vehicle group 611 of the Beijing Public Transport Company had already reached 410,000 kilometers without major overhaul. At present, most vehicles across the country can achieve 100,000 kilometers without major overhaul.

If a vehicle achieves "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul," it not only saves the state approximately 4,000 yuan in repair costs, but also equals adding one vehicle's worth of transportation capacity for one month; if it is further increased to 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul, it will save the state more than 10,000 yuan in repair costs (equal to half a Liberation brand vehicle) and increase transportation capacity by two and a half months. At the same time, due to good vehicle maintenance, it can also greatly save the consumption of gasoline, tires, and steel plates. In the past two years, highway automobile transportation workers across the country have saved the state more than 20 million liters of gasoline. Now two tires last as long as three used to.

Actively carrying out the 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul movement will comprehensively drive the work in all aspects of the highway system. Practice has proven that this is the central link in comprehensively improving highway work.

### 公路运输职工提出豪迈的新目标  安全、节约、二十万公里无大修

　　公路运输职工提出豪迈的新目标
    安全、节约、二十万公里无大修
    据新华社30日讯　我国公路运输职工将要在全国范围内开展一个“安全、节约、二十万公里无大修”的运动。这是中国公路运输工会第二次全国代表大会今天通过的一项重要决议上说的。
    代表们在讨论今后的任务时认为，公路运输职工除了要很好地完成国家在第二个五年计划期间的公路运输任务以支援工农业生产大跃进外，很重要的一项工作是在“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动的基础上向前跃进一步，在全国范围内开展一个“安全、节约、二十万公里无大修”运动。这是公路运输职工具体贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业方针的最实际最有效的行动。在1955年，我国公路运输部门的汽车平均要跑五万四千多公里大修一次。经过1956年开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动以后，1957年，全国就有七千八百多辆汽车超过十万公里无大修；有三百八十多辆汽车超过二十万公里无大修；北京公共汽车公司六一一车组的汽车已经达到四十一万公里无大修。目前全国大部分汽车都能达到十万公里无大修了。
    一辆汽车达到“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”，不仅为国家节省大约四千元的修理费用，而且还等于增加一辆车一个月的运输力；如果再提高到二十万公里无大修，那就要为国家节省一万元以上的修理费用（等于半辆解放牌汽车），并增加二个半月的运输力。同时由于车辆维护保养得好，还能大大地节省汽油、轮胎和钢板的消耗。二年来，全国公路汽车运输工人共为国家节省了二千多万公升的汽油。现在二条轮胎顶过去三条轮胎使用。
    积极开展二十万公里无大修运动，会把公路系统各个方面的工作全盘地带动起来。实践证明，这是全面提高公路工作的中心环节。
