    Riding the Socialist Wind, Breaking the Capitalist Waves
    Industrial and Commercial Figures Must Resolve to Transform Themselves
    Speech by Vice Chairman Chen Shutong
    I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.
    At present, our country is showing a vigorous and prosperous new atmosphere everywhere, truly a spring across the land. "Striving forward to build our country into a strong socialist modern power" and "Boosting our energy and launching a great leap forward in production and construction" have become the common language and unified action program of the people throughout the country. Whether from the south or north, from rural areas to cities, the good news, achievements, and letters of determination coming from the industrial and agricultural production fronts are truly inspiring. This shows that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, following the great victories of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the people of the whole country are launching a new high tide of socialist leap forward with unparalleled revolutionary vigor, on a revolutionary scale, at a revolutionary speed, and with a revolutionary spirit. Living in such a great era, I truly feel immense excitement and encouragement.
    In the past period, many people, including myself, had serious conservative ideas and viewpoints, regarding the socialist construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical proposed by the Party as an "adventurist" policy, and using individual shortcomings in construction as a basis for generalizing. The main reason for this was a failure to recognize that revolution must be accomplished in one go, constantly leaping forward. The root cause is still the mischief of bourgeois ideology.
    Facing such a great leap forward upsurge, it reminds me that in the past, many people, including myself, had serious right-leaning conservative thoughts and viewpoints, regarding the socialist construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical proposed by the Party as an "adventurist" policy, and generalizing based on individual shortcomings that occurred in our country's major construction projects. Why did we have such views? Today, I can say that it was mainly due to insufficient understanding of the socialist revolution, failure to recognize that revolution should be accomplished in one go, without interruption, and that this is the leap forward. We failed to recognize that our country's socialist revolution is advancing through constant leaps forward, and failed to recognize, as the People's Daily editorial said, that "a leap forward is a jump from an old stage to a new stage. Since it is something new, it will naturally not be perfect, nor will it be foolproof. There will be some shortcomings and errors of this or that kind, but this is by no means 'adventurism'." Tracing the root of these erroneous understandings, it is still the bourgeois ideology at play, hence the inability to muster revolutionary vigor for the socialist cause and the underestimation of the vast people's revolutionary enthusiasm for socialism and their collective wisdom. Those with right-leaning conservative ideas mostly come from the old society or are from the bourgeoisie. As for myself, having lived in the old society for seventy-five years, I brought in many things from the old society, and some are very deeply rooted. I know that I am old, but when I absorb some new things and new events in the new society, I feel much younger. However, from the perspective of right-leaning conservative thinking, I am indeed old. It is not easy for old people to absorb new things and new events, but in order to mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, can people like me, who have a lot of old things in their minds, still be utilized? If we can be utilized, then we must wash away the old things in our minds. Some do not have many old things and can be washed away easily. Once washed away, absorbing new things can play a positive role. Some have deeply rooted old things, so it is not easy to wash them away, and it will take more effort and a certain amount of time. I believe that the contradiction between our right-leaning conservative thinking and the leap forward in national construction is precisely a manifestation of the contradiction between old and new viewpoints. This contradiction, on the surface, seems to be a contradiction between walking faster and more on the road of socialism and walking slower and less, but in essence, it is a contradiction between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology. Our country was originally a poor and backward country. In order to defend independence and freedom, promote the people's happiness, and strengthen the forces for defending world peace and the just cause of mankind, we should strive to do what we should and can do, so that our country can be built into a strong socialist country as much, as quickly, as well, and as economically as possible. If we should and can do more, faster, better, and more economically, but do not do more, faster, better, and more economically, this is right-leaning conservatism, which will not be beneficial to socialism or to the people of the whole country. Right-leaning conservative thinking is bourgeois thinking, which is a different ideological system from socialist thinking. If the ideological viewpoints are not aligned, the assessment of things will also be incorrect. Therefore, we must be seriously vigilant against right-leaning conservative thinking, and not be complacent and content with the status quo. People's thinking either advances or retreats. If the times are developing forward but one does not advance, one will become increasingly backward. If this continues, it will inevitably become a question of two roads. Therefore, we must wage a resolute struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking.
    The erroneous idea of considering the Great Leap Forward as "adventurism" among the industrial and commercial circles is by no means a question of faster, slower, more, or less compared to the ideas of the broad working people on the Great Leap Forward, but rather a fundamental question of which path to take: socialism or capitalism. Therefore, industrial and commercial figures must resolve to undergo a painful process of self-transformation in order to fundamentally transform their political stance.
    This issue may be clearer when discussed in relation to the industrial and commercial circles. The idea of considering the country's major construction as "adventurism" existed in the past among industrial and commercial circles. Even now, some people still have this erroneous idea about our country's current Great Leap Forward. They are not only dealing with the problem of right-leaning conservative thinking, but also the problem of lingering affection for capitalism. We must not say that this idea and the ideas of the broad working people on the Great Leap Forward are a question of faster, slower, more, or less. We should affirm that this is a fundamental question of which path to take: socialism or capitalism. Therefore, I believe that industrial and commercial figures must resolve this fundamental issue of stance in order to align their understanding and actions with the surging Great Leap Forward situation.
    During the high tide of the three major socialist transformations, industrial and commercial figures understood the general trend and accepted the joint state-private ownership, changing the private ownership system. This was progress for the industrial and commercial figures, but at the same time, it should be frankly admitted that this was not natural. Therefore, although the economic base underwent a fundamental change, most people had not yet abandoned the capitalist stance in politics and ideology. They showed "abstract support, concrete negation" for accepting the Party's leadership and taking the socialist road. They were half-hearted rather than sincere. Therefore, when a small group of right-wing elements, headed by Zhang Naiqi, launched a frenzied attack on the Party, many people naturally resonated with them and easily looked to the right, wanting to go back.
    Through the anti-rightist struggle, the majority of people in our industrial and commercial circles have received a profound education and have begun to undergo varying degrees of leftward transformation in politics. However, their acceptance of the Party's leadership and the socialist road may not yet be heartfelt. They fear the pain and difficulty of transforming their stance, lack resolve, and are still undecided, like trying to draw water with fifteen buckets, not yet taking control of their own destiny. This half-heartedness clearly shows a lack of courage to break with capitalism and a lack of determination to establish socialism. They still think that the new is not as good as the old, naturally making it impossible to adapt to the current Great Leap Forward situation. Therefore, industrial and commercial figures must resolve to actively participate in rectification in order to transform their political stance.
    Transforming one's political stance is an essential transformation. It would be self-deception to say that there is no pain. However, we should recognize that after a painful process of self-transformation, we will feel comfortable and happy. With such an understanding, we will also have the courage to carry out self-struggle and self-transformation.
    Industrial and commercial figures must honestly and respectfully learn from the good qualities of the workers and peasants, actively participate in physical labor, and overcome their right-leaning conservative thinking through practice and labor.
    The reports of the national model workers and peasants at this People's Congress on the revolutionary vigor and heroic deeds of the national workers and peasants in the Great Leap Forward in production, as well as the revolutionary enthusiasm they have shown in newspapers recently, striving to be the first and fearing to be the last, with high morale and making contributions to socialism, are the best examples for our industrial and commercial figures to transform themselves. Since we have the desire to transform ourselves into glorious laborers who support themselves, then we must honestly and respectfully learn from them, learn their revolutionary vigor, learn their unwavering will to serve socialism wholeheartedly, learn their good qualities of being hardworking and enduring hardship, and learn their arduous labor without fear of difficulties. By doing so, we can make up our minds, boost our energy, ride the socialist wind, break the capitalist waves, actively participate in rectification, go down to the workshops and stores, actively participate in physical labor, seriously transform our political stance, recognize that the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction is a revolution, is progress, and not adventurism; recognize that conservative thinking is capitalist thinking, which is an enemy of socialism, and wage unremitting struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking in practice and in labor production, firmly grasp the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and contribute all our strength to the socialist Great Leap Forward together with the people of the whole country!
    Now, people, regardless of age, are experiencing the socialist revolution, and land, regardless of north or south, is unfolding the cause of socialist construction. This year is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. The national workers and peasants are enthusiastically striving to complete the Agricultural Development Program in eight years, and the main industrial products such as steel are to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom within fifteen years. Revolutionary vigor promotes the continuous victorious advancement of one revolutionary movement after another. This is something that right-leaning conservative capitalist thinking cannot, dare not, and cannot imagine. This is the most powerful crushing of all slanders and conspiracies of bourgeois right-wingers. The facts eloquently prove that unprecedented undertakings can only appear in the socialist era and can only be realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The revolutionary reality has educated us that listening to Chairman Mao and following the Communist Party, resolutely taking the socialist road, is always our guide for action.

    乘社会主义之风  破资本主义之浪
    工商业者必须痛下决心改造自己
    陈叔通副委员长的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的报告。
    目前我们的国家到处呈现着生气蓬勃、兴旺隆盛的新气象，真是大地皆春。“奋勇向前，把我国建成一个社会主义现代化强国”，“鼓起干劲，掀起生产建设大跃进”，已经成为全国人民的共同语言，一致的行动纲领。不论天南地北，从农村到城市，所传来的工农业生产战线的捷报、战果和决心书，真是振奋人心，这显示了在中国共产党的领导下，继政治战线上、思想战线上社会主义革命取得伟大胜利之后，全国人民正以无比充沛的革命干劲，在全国范围内掀起了一个具有革命的规模、革命的速度、革命的气概的社会主义跃进新高潮。生活在这样伟大的时代里，真是感到莫大的兴奋和鼓舞。
    在过去一个时期内，好多人，包括我在内有着严重的保守思想和观点，把党提出的多、快、好、省的社会主义建设方针看作是“冒进”的方针，把建设中的个别缺点作为依据概括一般。所以这样，主要是没有认识到革命就是要一气呵成，不断跃进，追其根源仍然是资产阶级思想在作怪。
    面对着这样一个大跃进高潮的时候，使我回想到在过去一个时间里，好多人，包括我在内，有着严重的右倾保守的思想和观点，把党所提出的多、快、好、省的社会主义建设方针看作是“冒进”的方针，把我国在大建设中所发生的个别缺点作为依据概括一般。为什么会有这样看法？今天说来，主要是对社会主义革命认识不足，没有认识到革命应该是一气呵成，不容间歇，这就是跃进，没有认识到我国的社会主义革命就是在不断地跃进中前进，没有认识到如人民日报社论所说“跃进是从旧的阶段跳到新的阶段，既然是新的东西，自然不会十全十美，不会万无一失，会有一些这样或者那样的缺点和过失，但这决不是‘冒进’”。追溯这些错误认识的根源，仍然是资产阶级的思想在作怪，因而鼓不起自己对社会主义事业的革命干劲，更低估了广大人民对社会主义的革命热情和他们的集体智慧。有右倾保守思想的人，大都是来自旧社会，或是出身于资产阶级。以我来说，在旧社会里生活了七十五年，从旧社会里带进来的东西也就多了，并且有的很牢固。我自己知道年纪老了，但当我在新社会吸收了一些新东西、新事物的时候，自己就感到年轻得多了，但从右倾保守思想这一点来看，我毕竟是年纪老了。年老的人吸收新东西、新事物是不容易的，但为了调动一切可以调动的积极因素，像我这样脑子里旧东西很多的人，是不是还可以加以利用呢？如其可以利用，那必须把脑子里的旧东西洗清。有的旧的东西不多，容易洗，洗清了，吸收新的东西就可以发挥积极作用。有的旧东西根深蒂固，要洗清就不太容易，就要多费力些，并且还要一定的时间。我认为我们的右倾保守思想与国家建设跃进之间的矛盾，正是表现新旧观点的矛盾。这一矛盾，从表面上看来，似乎是在社会主义的道路上走快一些、多走一些和走慢一些、少走一些之间的矛盾，但是，实质上是社会主义思想与资本主义思想之间的矛盾。我们的国家原来是一个贫穷落后的国家，为了保卫独立自由，增进人民幸福以及壮大保卫世界和平和人类正义事业的力量，就应该努力去做到应该可以做到的事，使我们国家尽可能多、快、好、省地建成一个社会主义的强国。如果应该和可以多、快、好、省，而不多、不快、不好、不省，这就是右倾保守，这就不会对社会主义有利，对全国人民有利的。右倾保守思想就是资产阶级的思想，与社会主义思想是两种对立的思想体系，思想观点不对头，对事物的估价也就不对头，因此，我们要严肃地警惕右倾保守思想，不能故步自封，安于现状。人们的思想，不进则退，时代向前发展了，不前进，自己也就会日益落后。发展下去，必然成为两条道路的问题，因此，我们必须与右倾保守思想作坚决的斗争。
    工商界中把大跃进认为是“冒进”的错误想法同广大劳动人民对大跃进的想法决不是一个快、慢、多、少之间的问题，而是社会主义与资本主义两条道路何去何从的根本问题。因此工商业者必须痛下决心，经历一个痛苦的自我改造的过程，来从本质上改造自己的政治立场。
    这个问题，以工商界来说，可能说得更清楚些，工商界中过去对国家的大建设看成是“冒进”的想法是存在的。现在还有人对我国当前的大跃进仍有这样错误的想法。他们不仅是右倾保守的思想问题，而且是留恋资本主义的问题。我们决不能说这种想法与广大劳动人民对大跃进的想法是一个快、慢、多、少之间的问题，应该肯定地说这是社会主义与资本主义两条道路何去何从的根本问题。因此，我认为工商业者必须解决这个根本性的立场问题，才能使自己的认识、行动与蓬勃地大跃进的形势相适应。
    三大社会主义改造高潮的时候，工商业者懂得大势所趋而接受全业公私合营，改变了私有制，这是工商业者的进步，但同时应该不讳言，这并不是自然的。所以，虽然经济基础起了根本性的变化，但大多数人在政治上、思想上，还没有抛弃资本主义的立场。表现出对接受党的领导和走社会主义道路是“抽象拥护，具体否定”，是三心二意而不是真心诚意。因此，碰到以章乃器为首的一小撮右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，也有很多的人就很自然地引起共鸣，就很容易地向右看，想走回头路。
    通过反右派斗争，我们工商界中多数人受到了深刻的教育，在政治上开始了不同程度的向左转化，但对接受党的领导和走社会主义道路还未必是心悦诚服，改造立场怕痛畏难，决心不足，思想上十五个吊桶打水还是七上八下，没有掌握起自己的命运。这样三心二意，七上八下，显然是对破资本主义没有勇气，立社会主义没有决心，还以为新的不如旧的好，自然也就与当前大跃进的形势不可能相适应了。因此工商业者必须痛下决心，积极参加整风，才能改造自己的政治立场。
    改造政治立场是本质的改造。如果说是没有痛苦，那是自欺欺人的话。但我们应该认识到经过了一个痛苦的自我改造的过程，就会感到舒畅愉快。有了这样的认识，也就会有勇气进行自我斗争和自我改造。
    工商业者要老老实实地、恭恭敬敬地向工农群众的优良品质学习，要积极参加体力劳动，从实践中和劳动中克服自己的右倾保守思想。
    这次人代大会上，工、农业劳动模范的发言中所汇报的全国工人、农民在生产大跃进中的革命干劲和英雄事迹，以及最近一个时期内报纸上所报道的他们那种争先恐后，意志昂扬，为社会主义立功的革命热情正是我们工商业者自我改造最好的榜样。我们既有把自己改造成为自食其力的光荣的劳动者的愿望，那末就必须老老实实地、恭恭敬敬地向他们学习，学习他们的革命干劲，学习他们全心全意为社会主义服务的坚定意志，学习他们刻苦耐劳的优良品质，学习他们不辞艰难的辛勤劳动。这样做，我们才能下定决心，鼓起干劲，乘社会主义之风，破资本主义之浪，积极参加整风；下车间、下商店，积极参加体力劳动，认真改造自己的政治立场，认识社会主义建设的大跃进，是革命，是前进，而不是什么冒进；认识保守思想也就是资本主义思想，是社会主义的敌人，从实践中，从劳动生产中，与右倾保守思想作不懈的斗争，紧紧地掌握多、快、好、省的方针，与全国人民一起，为社会主义大跃进贡献出一切力量！
    现在，人不分老幼，都在经历着社会主义革命，地无分南北，都在展开社会主义建设的事业，今年是第二个五年建设计划的头一年，全国工人、农民，热火朝天地要把农业发展纲要争取八年完成，工业的钢铁等主要产品要在十五年内赶上并超过英国。革命的干劲，促进了革命运动一个接着一个不断的胜利前进，这是右倾保守的资本主义思想所不能、不敢、也无法想像的。这是最有力的粉碎资产阶级右派的一切诽谤和阴谋。事实雄辩地证明，史无前例的事业，只有在社会主义的时代才能出现，只有在中国共产党的领导下才能实现，革命的现实，教育了我们，听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，坚决走社会主义的道路，永远是我们行动的指南。
