    The Springtime of Our Era
    Jin Zhonghua

    Our era is one of great historical transformation. Looking at the world in the New Year, socialist countries are flourishing, and people are full of confidence; capitalism is a murky mess, full of contradictions. The world's climate has changed, and the wind direction has turned. To use the most popular phrase of the moment: the East wind prevails over the West wind.

    Spring brings hope to people. But this only has real meaning for socialist countries and nationally independent countries. In the old, major capitalist countries, even though spring has arrived, dark clouds still hang low, and the cold wind blows in gusts; people are trembling with fear, wondering when the recession will come and how much unemployment will increase. Some say: if New York sneezes, London will catch a cold. Capitalism has reached such a fragile state!

    We think of the three international conferences held not long ago. In early November last year, the socialist world celebrated its fortieth birthday. Leaders of Communist and Workers' parties from more than sixty countries gathered in Moscow and issued two historic declarations. The world's working class is united like brothers, and all peace-loving people are closely united: this is of epoch-making significance. In mid-December, another conference of Western countries was held in Paris, where the big and small bosses of the North Atlantic war bloc sang a duet; they shouted threats, complained to each other, and the result was a farce and an ugly show. From the end of December to the beginning of this year, another grand gathering was held in Cairo, where representatives from nearly fifty countries in Asia and Africa expressed the desire for unity of the 1.7 billion people, who make up two-thirds of the world's population; among them were people from socialist countries, people from nationally independent countries, people who had already achieved independence and liberation, and people from colonies and semi-colonies who are striving for independence and liberation. Despite these many differences, they were completely united in opposing imperialism and colonialism and in demanding peace, friendship, and cooperation—this is an unprecedented event in world history. These three conferences are a microcosm of the current world stage.

    At the beginning of this year, the Associated Press published its top ten news stories of 1957, selected from reader surveys. This is a capitalist news gimmick; but in today's world situation, this originally meaningless thing has even shown some special significance. The top news story was the launch of the Soviet Union's two artificial satellites. The second biggest news was the Little Rock incident in the southern United States, where insane persecution of Black people sparked a political storm. The third was the consolidation of the leadership of the Soviet Party headed by Comrade Khrushchev. And the tenth was the Girard incident, where the shooting of a Japanese woman by an American soldier sparked angry struggles by the Japanese people. Let's not talk about the others. Just these few news stories show that, on the one hand, socialist countries are moving forward head-on, politically as solid as a rock; on the other hand, they expose the naked madness and ugliness of US imperialism, which has been justly condemned by the people of the world.

    Now, in the skies at the beginning of 1958, there are two artificial satellites in operation. One is Soviet, which, according to a Western news agency, "is a huge object weighing one thousand one hundred and eighteen pounds," while the other artificial satellite, the American "Explorer," "only weighs about thirty pounds in total." In comparison, socialist Soviet Union has taken the lead, while capitalist America has been left far behind.

    The tremendous changes in the world situation are particularly clear at the beginning of 1958. We have crossed a major turning point in history and are leaping forward. Now, the center of gravity of the world has shifted; it is no longer in the West but in the East. Every step forward we take accelerates the change in the world situation.

    For the past few days, the voices of workers, farmers, scientists, and writers from the venue of our National People's Congress have attracted the world's attention. This is the oath of 600 million people marching towards socialism. Friends from all over the world are as happy as we are. Even some people with absolutely no good intentions cannot help but admit that this overwhelming driving force is unstoppable. A Tokyo dispatch from United Press International on the 6th of this month said: "Peaceful coexistence will dominate the Far East, and any method of increasing war tensions is useless. Many signs indicate that direction, and the strongest of them comes from the current session of the National People's Congress in Beijing."

    The imperialists are constantly thinking about creating war tensions, but now they know that this is very difficult. The idea of peaceful coexistence is increasingly gaining the upper hand. Let us have a peaceful competition! We believe that socialism will definitely win in peaceful competition.

    In the spring, a new green will appear in the socialist garden, bringing a riot of color and bearing abundant fruits. "Look at three years in five, look at the first year in three, and look at the spring in the first year," this is our common song of praise for socialist spring. Spring belongs to us, belongs to the increasingly bright and happy socialist world.

    我们时代的春天
    金仲华
    我们的时代是一个历史上大转变的时代。新年看世界，社会主义国家欣欣向荣，人们信心百倍；资本主义一片乌烟瘴气，到处充满矛盾。世界的气候变了，风向转了。用现在最流行的一句话：东风压倒了西风。
    春天，给人们带来了希望。但这只是对社会主义国家和民族独立国家来说，才有真实的意义。在老大的资本主义国家，虽然春天来了，还是暗云低垂，寒风阵阵；人们在胆战心惊地问着萧条何时来，失业增加多少。有人说：纽约打个喷嚏，伦敦会受到感冒。资本主义已到了如此弱不禁风的地步了！
    我们想到了不久以前举行的三个国际会议。去年11月初，社会主义世界欢庆它的四十岁诞辰。六十多个国家的共产党、工人党领导人物云集莫斯科，发表了两个历史性的宣言。全世界工人阶级像兄弟一样的团结，所有爱好和平的人民紧密地团结在一起：这是具有划时代的意义的。12月中，另一个西方国家的会议举行在巴黎，北大西洋战争集团的大小头目们，唱了一场对台戏；他们吆声恫吓，相互抱怨，结果成了一幕闹剧和丑剧。从12月底到今年初，再有一个盛大的集会举行在开罗，来自亚非两大洲近五十个国家的代表们，表达了占世界人口三分之二的十七亿人民要求团结的愿望；其中有来自社会主义国家的，也有来自民族独立国家的，有已经取得了独立解放的人民，也有正在争取独立解放的殖民地和半殖民地的人民，尽管有这许多不同，他们在反对帝国主义和殖民主义，要求和平、友好、合作方面，是完全一致的——这是世界历史上的一件空前盛事。这三个会议，正是当前世界舞台的一个缩影。
    今年年头，美联社发表了它从读者测验中选出的1957年的十大新闻。这是资产阶级新闻的玩意儿；但是在今天的世界局势下，这个本来无聊的玩意儿，竟然也显出了一些特殊的意义。头一件大新闻是苏联的两颗人造卫星上了天。第二件大新闻是美国南部由于疯狂迫害黑人而激起一个政治风暴的小石城事件。第三件是以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党的领导的巩固。还有第十件，是由于一个美国军官枪杀日妇而激起日本人民愤怒斗争的哲腊德事件。别的不去说它们了。仅就这几件新闻来说，一方面显示着社会主义国家正在迎头前进，政治上像磐石一样巩固；另一方面，则暴露着美帝国主义赤裸裸的疯狂和丑态，受到了全世界人民的正义指斥。
    现在，在1958年头的天空，有两颗人造卫星在运行着。一颗是苏联的，用一个西方通讯社的说法，“是一个重达一千一百一十八磅的庞然大物”，而另一颗人造卫星，美国的“探险者”，“总共才只有三十磅左右”。两相比较，社会主义苏联已经迈步走在前面，而资本主义的美国则远远被抛在后面了。
    世界形势的巨大变化，在1958年头特别看得清楚。我们已跨过了历史的重大转折点，飞跃前进。现在，世界的重心转移了，它已经不在西方而在东方了。我们的每一步前进，加速了世界形势的变化。
    几天来，从我们全国人民代表大会会场上发出的工人、农民、科学家、作家们的声音，吸引着世界的注意。这是六亿人民向社会主义进军的誓言。世界各国的朋友们和我们同样高兴。甚至有些绝无好意的人也不能不承认这种排山倒海的前进动力是无法阻挡的。本月六日合众社的一条东京电讯中说：“和平共处将在远东占优势，任何增加战争紧张局势的办法都没有用。许多迹象都表明那个方向，而其中最强烈的迹象，是来自目前在北京举行的全国人民代表大会会议。”
    帝国主义者念念不忘于制造战争紧张局势，但是现在他们知道这是很困难的了。和平共处的思想愈来愈占得了优势。让我们和平竞赛吧！我们相信社会主义一定会在和平竞赛中取胜。
    春天，在社会主义的大花园中将出现一片新绿，带来万紫千红，结成丰饶的果实。“五年看三年，三年看头年，头年看春天”，这是我们歌颂社会主义春天的共同歌调。春天是属于我们的，属于愈来愈光明和幸福的社会主义世界的。
