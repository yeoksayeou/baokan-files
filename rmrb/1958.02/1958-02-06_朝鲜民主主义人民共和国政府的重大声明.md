　　The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued an important statement on February 5 regarding the peaceful reunification of Korea, advocating for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the implementation of free elections throughout Korea for a certain period after the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from both North and South Korea. It also proposed that consultations between North and South Korea should be held as soon as possible to discuss economic and cultural ties, and that the armed forces of North and South Korea should be reduced to a minimum in the shortest possible time to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. These suggestions not only reflect the strong desire and firm will of the Korean people to see their homeland unified but also demonstrate once again the significant efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. At a time when the global political climate is shifting towards an easing of tensions, with an unprecedented surge in calls to "give the world peace," this effort by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will also powerfully promote the easing of global tensions.
　　It has been more than twelve years since the Korean people were liberated from Japanese rule, and more than four years since the end of the Korean War, yet Korea remains divided. This unfortunate situation is entirely the result of the United States' policy of aggression towards Korea. Even before the Korean War, the United States illegally used the flag of the United Nations in an attempt to permanently divide Korea and further transform it into its colony and war base. Therefore, due to its obstruction, the Soviet-American Joint Commission failed to reach any agreement on the issue of establishing a provisional Korean democratic government, and the three peaceful reunification proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea yielded no results. In 1950, the United States went so far as to launch a war, attempting to impose the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee clique it supported on North Korea by force. But the United States failed, and it was finally forced to sign the armistice agreement. After the armistice, the United States failed to fulfill the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the convening of a political conference to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and rudely refused to convene a political conference. At the same time, the United States signed a so-called mutual defense treaty with the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique it supported, strengthening its military occupation and colonial rule over South Korea. At the Geneva Conference, due to the United States continuing to adopt an unreasonable attitude, the consultations on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue also failed to achieve any results.
　　Korea's prolonged state of division has caused great damage to the interests of the Korean nation and brought great suffering to the Korean people. Even the mythical Milky Way has a bridge of magpies for passage, but the narrow divide in Korea has cut off contact between relatives and friends in the North and South, preventing the exchange of goods. For a unified nation, could there be a more abnormal and unreasonable situation than this? Due to the separation between North and South, the normal development of Korea's politics, economy, and culture has been hindered. Especially in South Korea, due to the collusion between the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, any desire for peaceful reunification and any patriotic action by the people has been subjected to brutal suppression, and the people's basic democratic rights and freedoms have been completely deprived. In fact, South Korea under the forcible occupation of the US military has today been reduced to a hell where the people have no means of livelihood and popular grievances are boiling. The continued presence of US troops in South Korea not only creates disasters for the Korean people, but also, due to the US violation of the armistice agreement and the introduction of atomic weapons into South Korea, South Korea has increasingly become a US atomic base. In order to eliminate the threat of a new war from Korean territory and consolidate peace in Korea and the Far East, the calls of the people of southern Korea to get rid of the US military occupation and colonial rule in South Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland are growing stronger and stronger.
　　The consistent position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and to seek a solution to the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea on the principle of Koreans handling their own affairs, and this is also a position that China, the Soviet Union, and all other peace-loving countries and peoples agree with and support. During the Korean armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side repeatedly proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops. However, the US side repeatedly and unreasonably refused to reach an agreement with the Korean-Chinese side on the withdrawal of foreign troops. Although the US side withdrew some troops, it still occupies important bases.
　　The United States refuses to withdraw its troops from Korea in an attempt to permanently occupy South Korea as a war base and colony, and to seize the opportunity to re-launch a war of aggression and extend the reactionary rule of South Korea to North Korea. But three years of war have proved that any attempt to resolve the Korean issue by force is doomed to failure. Since the United States could not do this more than seven years ago, then today, when the strength of the Korean people has become even greater and when the global tide of peace is even higher, if the United States goes against the will of heaven and insists on resolving the Korean issue by force, it can only be playing with fire and burning itself. In fact, the United States' refusal to withdraw its troops from South Korea does not indicate its strength, but only indicates its weakness; it relies more on bayonets to maintain its colonial rule over South Korea.
　　The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and wholeheartedly supported the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We fully support the various proposals put forward once again by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful reunification of Korea. These proposals not only conform to the greatest interests of the Korean nation but also conform to the interests of peace in the whole of Asia. The Korean region is also one of the hotbeds of war created by the United States around the world. If the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully, it will be of great significance for easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. Therefore, we believe that the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be given serious consideration and support by all relevant parties. We Chinese people will work together with the Korean people and all peace-loving people to realize these peaceful proposals.

### 朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的重大声明

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的重大声明
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日就朝鲜的和平统一问题发表重要声明，主张撤出在朝鲜的一切外国军队，并在一切外国军队全部撤出南北朝鲜以后，在一定时期内实行全朝鲜的自由选举；同时提出，应当早日实现南北朝鲜之间的协商，讨论经济文化联系，在尽量短的时间内把南北朝鲜的军队缩减到最低限度，以实现朝鲜的和平统一。这些建议不仅反映了朝鲜人民渴望祖国得到统一的强烈愿望和坚定意志，而且也再一次说明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的重大努力。在今天全世界政治气候转向东风解冻，“给世界以和平”的呼声空前高涨的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的这种努力，也将有力地推动世界紧张局势的趋向缓和。
    朝鲜人民摆脱日本统治已经十二年多了，朝鲜战争结束也已经四年多了，但是朝鲜至今仍处于分裂局面。这个不幸的局面，完全是美国对朝鲜的侵略政策所造成的。早在朝鲜战争以前，美国就非法利用联合国的旗帜企图长期分裂朝鲜，并进而把朝鲜变为它的殖民地和战争基地。因此，在它的阻挠下，苏美联合委员会在成立临时朝鲜民主政府问题上迟迟未能达成任何协议，而朝鲜民主主义人民共和国三次提出的和平统一朝鲜的方案也未能得到任何结果。1950年，美国竟不惜发动战争，想通过武力来把它所扶植的李承晚集团的反动统治强加于北朝鲜。但是美国失败了，最后它不得不在停战协定上签字。在停战之后，美国又不履行停战协定中关于召开政治会议以讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的规定，粗暴地拒绝召开政治会议。同时，美国同它所扶植的李承晚反动集团签订所谓共同防御条约，加强了对南朝鲜的军事占领和殖民统治。在日内瓦会议上，由于美国继续采取蛮不讲理的态度，关于和平解决朝鲜问题的协商也没有取得任何成果。
    朝鲜长期处于分裂状态，使朝鲜民族利益蒙受了极大损害，给朝鲜人民带来了极大痛苦。神话里的银河尚有鹊桥可通，而朝鲜的一线之隔，竟使南北亲朋断绝往来，有无不能相通。对于一个统一的民族来说，难道还有比这更不正常、更不合理的情况吗？由于南北隔绝，朝鲜的政治、经济、文化的正常发展都受到了阻碍。特别是在南朝鲜，由于美国和李承晚集团的互相勾结，人民要求和平统一的任何愿望和任何爱国行动都受到残暴的镇压，人民的起码的民主权利和自由都已被剥夺净尽。事实上，美军强占下的南朝鲜，今天已经沦为一个民不聊生、民怨沸腾的地狱。美军留驻南朝鲜，不仅给朝鲜人民制造了灾难，并且由于美国破坏停战协定，把原子武器运进南朝鲜，南朝鲜已经日益成为美国的原子基地。为了从朝鲜的领土上消除新的战争威胁，巩固朝鲜和远东的和平，朝鲜南部的人民要求摆脱美国在南朝鲜的军事占领和殖民统治、实现祖国和平统一的呼声，是越来越强大了。
    从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，使和平统一朝鲜的问题在朝鲜人自己处理自己问题的原则上求得解决，是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一贯主张，也是中国、苏联和其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民所赞同和支持的主张。在朝鲜停战的谈判过程中，朝中方面曾不断提出了撤退一切外国军队的建议。但是美国方面却一再蛮横无理地拒绝同朝中方面就撤退外国军队问题达成协议，美国方面虽然撤退了一部分军队，但仍然占据着重要的基地。
    美国拒绝从朝鲜撤退军队，是企图永久霸占南朝鲜作为战争基地和殖民地，并伺机重新发动侵略战争，把南朝鲜的反动统治扩展到北朝鲜去。但是三年的战争已经证明，任何想用武力来解决朝鲜问题的企图都是注定要失败的。七年多以前，美国既然做不到这一点，那么，当今天朝鲜人民的力量已经更加壮大，当全世界的和平浪潮更加高涨的时候，美国如果逆天行事，坚持用武力解决朝鲜问题，那就更是只能玩火自焚。其实，美国拒绝从南朝鲜撤军并不表明它的强大，而只是表明它的虚弱，它更加依靠刺刀来维持它对南朝鲜殖民统治罢了。
    中国人民对朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争，始终抱着深切的同情，并且给予衷心的支持。我们完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国目前再一次提出的关于撤退一切外国军队、和平统一朝鲜的各项建议。这些建议不仅符合朝鲜民族的最大利益，而且符合整个亚洲和平的利益。朝鲜地区也是美国在世界各地所制造的战争温床之一，朝鲜问题如果能够和平解决，对于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平将有重大意义。因此，我们认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建议，应该得到一切有关方面的郑重考虑和支持。我们中国人民将同朝鲜人民和一切爱好和平人民一起，为实现这些和平建议而努力。
