The Morphology and Life Cycle of Flies
Flies are insects of the order Diptera. Their bodies are divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. On both sides of the thorax are a pair of wings.

Most flies have a semi-circular head, convex in the front and flat in the back. Looking at the head from the front, there are two large compound eyes on the upper side, and a depression in the middle where a pair of antennae are located. The antenna is divided into three segments, the first and second segments are short, and the third segment is long and large, with a bristle called the antennal arista on top. The mouthparts in the center of the lower part of the fly's head are used to suck food. The shape of the mouthparts of various flies are different. Some can only suck, called sucking flies (such as houseflies), some can pierce the skin and suck blood, called blood-sucking flies (such as stable flies), and some have no mouthparts and do not eat anything, called non-feeding flies (such as cattle grubs).

The thorax of flies is short and wide, with a pair of wings on each side. The wing membrane is transparent, and in addition to the costal vein and subcostal vein, there are six longitudinal veins. On the abdomen of the fly are three pairs of legs, made up of eight segments. The last segment has a pair of claws and a pair of claw pads. The abdomen of the fly is short and wide, in an oblong shape, and four or five segments can be seen.

Flies are either female or male. In most male flies, the eyes on both sides of the face are closer to the midline, while in female flies, the eyes are farther from the midline. Females and males mate and lay eggs. The eggs are oblong. The eggs hatch into larvae, commonly known as maggots. Fly maggots are cone-shaped, pointed at the front and flat at the back. The larvae eat food, grow, and shed their skin twice. The third-stage larvae do not shed their skin, but contract and become pupae. The pupae develop internally and eventually transform into adults, which are flies. The wings of flies that have just hatched from the pupa are not yet unfolded, and they can only crawl and not fly. After some time, the wings unfold and harden, and they can fly. This is the general life cycle of a fly.

Some flies lay eggs that hatch into maggots immediately, or produce maggots directly (such as some flesh flies), but most flies lay eggs, which then transform and hatch into maggots.

The place where flies lay their eggs is where the larvae (maggots) breed, but because of the different types of flies, the places where fly maggots breed are also very different. Generally speaking, they can be divided into the following categories:

1.	Rotting organic matter: including animal feces, such as human, livestock, and poultry feces; rotting plant waste, such as livestock and poultry feed; residue from tofu and noodle production, rotten grass, etc. Many types of flies breed in these substances.
2.	Rotting animal tissue: such as carcasses of livestock, birds, or fish; animal bones, animal fur, and bird feathers, etc.
3.	Ulcerated wounds on living objects: if any animal, including humans and livestock, has a wound that is ulcerated and has an odor, it will attract flies to lay eggs and breed maggots in the ulcerated area.
4.	Organs of living animals: the subcutaneous tissue and stomach of cattle, horses, donkeys, etc., often have fly maggots parasitic on them.

Common Flies and Their Habits
There are many types of flies. In terms of size, there are very small fruit flies and very large hoverflies, like bees. In terms of color, there are grey-black flies (such as houseflies), green flies (such as green bottle flies), and blue flies (such as blow flies). In terms of temperament, some live in the wild, in fields, and in forests, and some live in or near homes. Generally speaking, flies that live in wild weeds only eat the juice of plants and flowers, and never approach humans or human food, so they are not important. However, flies that live near homes are important because they are important carriers of disease, so we must vigorously eliminate these types of flies.

There are also several types of flies in and around homes, the most common and important of which are the following:

1.	Housefly: Its scientific name is *Musca domestica*, commonly known as the "meal fly" or "rice midge," because this type of fly often gathers in groups to suck on human food. Its body is grey-black. It is the most common and numerous fly in homes and courtyards across the country, accounting for about 95% to 98% of the common flies in homes and courtyards, so it has become the general representative of all flies. The back of its thorax has four equally spaced black longitudinal stripes of equal length. The fourth longitudinal vein on the wing bends forward into an angular shape. The front of the abdomen is light in color, with an orange-yellow color on both sides near the thorax. The tail of the abdomen gradually darkens, and there is a black longitudinal stripe in the center of the back. A female housefly can lay about one hundred to one hundred and fifty eggs at a time. In summer, especially in southern China, female houseflies can lay eggs once every six to eight days. Excluding overwintering adult flies, a housefly can live for about two months, so a female housefly can lay eggs about ten times in its lifetime. The housefly larva takes about seven days to become a pupa, and the pupa takes about five days to become an adult fly. It takes about four days for the adult fly to emerge from the pupa, mate, and lay eggs again, so it takes about fifteen days for the entire process from egg to adult fly that can mate and lay eggs. As for the length of the housefly's activity season, there is a great difference between southern and northern China due to the country's vast land area. In the southernmost areas, it is warm all year round, so all stages of the housefly can be seen all year round. July and August are the peak breeding season for houseflies. In the northernmost areas, it is only more common during the warm season from May to July each year.

Houseflies like to eat everything. From the best and cleanest food to the dirtiest and smelliest human and animal feces and rotting animal carcasses, they like to eat it all. Human and other animal excretions, such as eye discharge, phlegm, pus, and blood, they also eat. Raw fish, meat, vegetables, salty soy sauce, pickles, sugars, melons, and fruits, they also like to eat. Rotting and spoiled food attracts even more houseflies to suck on it. Especially in families that do not pay attention to hygiene and in some special factories, such as blood meal factories, firecracker workshops, animal bone processing plants, pig farms, milk factories, candy and bread factories, and garbage and manure treatment plants, you can often see groups of houseflies densely packed on uncovered food, unwashed basins and bowls, blood meal, paste, animal bones, especially bone residue after oil extraction, milk containers, randomly spat phlegm, food for poultry and livestock, feces, and on unbandaged or smelly sores and the eyes and corners of the mouths of children. These complex habits of houseflies have a very close relationship with humans, making them important flies that directly or indirectly transmit many important diseases. In addition, houseflies have a habit of liking light. They often gather in groups to bask in the sun by the walls or under the eaves of the courtyard. They stop moving after dark. In dark weather and at night, they stay on the ceiling, hanging ropes, and electric wires.

Female houseflies lay their eggs in various rotting plant organic matter. The larvae that hatch from the eggs eat and grow in it. The feces of donkeys, horses, pigs, cattle, chickens, ducks, etc., other recently rotten and smelly food and garbage, and various grain residues used by tofu workshops and soy sauce gardens are all the favorite foods of houseflies and also the places where they like to lay their eggs the most. Because the respiratory openings of housefly larvae do not have special waterproof structures, they cannot grow in substances soaked in liquid, nor can they grow up eating fairly dry substances. Because the organic matter mentioned above is everywhere and in large quantities, houseflies are found throughout the country, and they are also the most numerous of all fly species in homes.

The climate in the south is warm, and it is not cold even in winter, so housefly larvae can often be seen in moist organic matter that has not been soaked in liquid. Adult flies can lay eggs and reproduce all year round, but the various stages of the growth process are somewhat prolonged. The winters in the north are cold, and the housefly larvae and even pupae are frozen to death in the breeding ground and the nearby loose soil. Adult flies can only gather in warm places with food, such as kitchens, dining rooms, special factories (such as firecracker workshops, oil barrel factories, milk processing plants), etc., to overwinter, and stop laying eggs and breeding at the same time, but they do not completely stop moving. When the temperature in the house drops (below 10℃), their activity decreases, and they can also be frozen to death at even lower temperatures. When the temperature is suitable (around 25℃), they are extremely active and can also mate. If the room maintains a suitable temperature for a long time and there are places suitable for larvae to breed, houseflies can still lay eggs and reproduce. Therefore, houseflies do not truly overwinter (hibernate) but rather live through the winter.

2.	Mountain Fly: Also known as the city fly, its appearance is very similar to that of the housefly, but it is slightly smaller and the color is lighter. The main difference between it and the housefly is that the back of its thorax has only two black longitudinal stripes. These longitudinal stripes have a not very obvious bifurcation in the front. Although there is also a black longitudinal stripe in the center of the abdomen, the entire abdomen is dark brown. Mountain flies like to live outdoors. Female flies like to lay eggs in fresh human feces, dog feces, and cow feces outdoors, so many mountain fly larvae can often be found in these small piles of feces. Mountain flies are the most common flies in the mountainous areas of China, more common in the south than in the north, and less common in the plains. In general, the habits of mountain flies are similar to those of houseflies, but the difference is that mountain flies are mostly outdoors, and the larvae breed in small piles of fresh human feces, dog feces, and cow feces outdoors. Therefore, mountain flies also have a very close relationship with humans and can transmit many diseases to humans.

3.	Large Housefly: Its scientific name is *Stomoxys calcitrans*, a common species in the genus *Stomoxys*. Its shape is similar to that of the housefly, but it is larger than the housefly and the color is lighter, being dark grey. The main difference between the large housefly and the housefly is that half of the end of its legs is orange-red, the tip of the chest is also light orange-red, the fourth longitudinal vein on the wings does not bend forward into an angular shape, but slightly forward into an arc, and the abdomen is also completely dark brown. It often likes to gather outdoors on human and animal feces and rotting vegetables, melons, and fruits to suck. Female flies also lay eggs on these substances, because these substances are also the best breeding grounds for their larvae. The large housefly is the most common fly species in cattle, donkey, and horse sheds. It generally does not like to enter human homes, but it is often found in kitchens and dining rooms. At the same time, it does not like too hot and too cold seasons, so it is more common in spring and autumn and less common in summer. In winter, female flies overwinter in damp and unventilated dark places. Large houseflies are found throughout the country, and are more common in the northwest.

4.	Latrine Fly: The most common are two types. Its appearance is similar to that of the housefly, but it is smaller than the housefly. The main difference between it and the housefly is that its antennal arista is smooth and hairless, and the fourth longitudinal vein on the wing is straight. Latrine flies are most common in toilets, but are also often found indoors and outdoors. The characteristic of its adults is that they often fly in the air, but the position does not move. They rarely stay on food to suck. Latrine flies like to lay eggs in cesspools, especially in feces pools where human feces and urine are mixed. It does not have a very close relationship with humans.

5.	Golden Blowfly: Its body is green-blue, short and fat, and it does not fly very agilely. This fly has a large head and large, bright red eyes, so it is also called the red-headed fly. It likes to eat sweet and fishy-smelling foods, such as cut or rotten raw melons, fruits, fishy-smelling fish and meat, etc. It is more common to see it sucking and laying eggs on thin and fresh human feces. Because it has this more special habit, the golden blowfly has also become an important vector of infectious diseases, especially for spreading intestinal infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever.

The main breeding places of the larvae of the golden blowfly are semi-liquid and liquid feces pools, cesspools, and fecal vats where people often defecate. Piles of golden blowfly larvae can be seen in these places. In addition, it can also grow in fresh and thin pig manure. Golden blowflies are found throughout the country, less in the north and more in the south. This type of fly is most common in villages and towns where public toilets are poorly managed. The adults of the golden blowfly can be seen in the south from May to October, with August being the most common. The warm season in the north is short, so adults only appear around July. Because the northeast and northwest do not have the habit of storing liquid human feces and the climate is cold, golden blowflies are extremely rare.

The life history of the golden blowfly is relatively special. Its larvae develop quickly. The larvae hatch from the eggs and grow to maturity and pupate in about four days. Except for overwintering, the pupal stage is only about four days, so the entire growth process of the golden blowfly is only a little over a week.

The golden blowfly overwinters as a pupa. The overwintering location is in the crevices, wall cracks, and nearby loose soil of its larval breeding grounds.

6.	Green Bottle Fly: Commonly known as the green bean fly. The thorax and abdomen of this fly are both shiny copper-green or bronze in color, so it is also called the shiny fly. It includes many types, the most common of which are *Lucilia sericata* (also known as the silver green fly) and *Lucilia caesar*. Its body is slightly smaller than that of the golden blowfly, and it flies more agilely. The head and eyes are small and not very red, making it easy to distinguish from the golden blowfly. These two types of green bottle flies like to eat smelly animal carcasses and smelly fish and shrimp the most, so they are most common in fish farms, animal bone, fur, chicken and duck feather, pig bristle processing plants, and places with rotting animal carcasses. They are also often seen on human and dog feces outdoors. Female flies only lay eggs on substances containing rotting meat, and the larvae can only eat rotting meat and grow in these substances. After growing to maturity, they crawl to the nearby drier soil to pupate. It takes about twelve days for the development from egg to adult fly. Green bottle flies generally do not like to enter indoors. *Lucilia sericata* overwinters as mature larvae in the soil near the breeding ground, and then pupates the following spring and hatches into adult flies. *Lucilia sericata* and *Lucilia caesar* are found throughout the country, and are most common in smelly places.

7.	Blow Fly: Also known as the blue fly. This fly includes several types. Its body is two to three times larger than that of the housefly. The thorax is blue-black with black longitudinal stripes, and the abdomen is dark blue-green. Therefore, it is not difficult to distinguish from the green bottle fly. The commonly seen species in China are *Calliphora vicina*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Protophormia terraenovae*. Adult flies do not enter indoors under normal circumstances. The first two types of adult flies often appear in toilets, garbage dumps, human and animal feces, and animal carcasses. They also like to approach food, such as fruits, sweets, etc. The larvae of *Calliphora vicina*, like the golden blowfly, mainly breed in semi-liquid and liquid fresh human feces, and also breed on the rotten meat of livestock feces, garbage, animal bones, fur, and animal carcasses, etc. The larvae of *Chrysomya megacephala* and *Protophormia terraenovae* mainly breed in substances containing rotten meat, so the larvae of these two types of blow flies are often found in the same place as the larvae of *Lucilia sericata*. However, it is much smaller in number than the green bottle fly. The common blow flies mainly overwinter as mature larvae in the moist and loose soil near the breeding ground, and a small number of pupae can also overwinter.

8.	Flesh Fly: This fly also includes many types. Most flesh flies are slightly larger than blow flies, greyish-brown, with clear three black longitudinal stripes on the back of the thorax, and chessboard-shaped black spots on the back of the abdomen that change with the direction of observation. The most common type in Chinese homes is *Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis*, which likes to eat human feces and fermented plant foods, such as soy sauce, pickles, etc. It can also be seen on smelly fish and meat. Its larvae mainly breed in liquid human feces, often growing together with the larvae of golden blowflies, but it can also grow in soy sauce vats, pickles, and rotten meat, so it is also often called the meat fly. Flesh flies often appear in soy sauce garden factories and fish and meat markets, but they do not enter indoors. Flesh flies overwinter as flies, often overwintering in the same place as the pupae of golden blowflies.

Among the various flies mentioned above, the most common in homes in various regions is the housefly, the most common outdoors is the golden blowfly, the mountain fly is the most common outdoors in mountainous areas, the large housefly is the most common in cattle and horse sheds, and the latrine fly is commonly seen in toilets. Other types of flies are only most common in more special environments, such as green bottle flies and blow flies being most common in processing plants for animal bones, fur, pig bristles, and chicken and duck feathers. Dog farms, because they often have large amounts of fresh dog feces, also have a lot of green bottle flies. Flesh flies are more common in soy sauce garden workshops. Of course, these types of flies can also be found in courtyards, but in very small numbers. Therefore, from the habits and numbers of adult flies, houseflies, golden blowflies, and mountain flies have the closest relationship with humans, so they are the main carriers of certain human diseases, especially intestinal infectious diseases.

From the eight most common and important flies mentioned above, it can be known that the reason why there are these flies near homes is that environmental hygiene has not been done well. If there are human, animal, and poultry feces, plant substances, such as livestock and poultry food waste, and rotting plants, such as vegetable leaves, spoiled melons and fruits, rotting animal products such as animal bones, fur, and feathers, etc., near the home, these flies will be produced. In addition to producing the above eight types of flies, these discarded items also produce other types of flies.

Diseases Transmitted by Flies and Methods of Transmission
Flies are very filthy. The reason why they can transmit diseases is due to this filthy habit. Flies can transmit five types of diseases.

1. Intestinal Infectious Diseases:

Dysentery: There are bacillary dysentery and amoebic dysentery. This disease is caused by the infection of dysentery bacilli or amoeba in the human intestines. People with dysentery have many bowel movements, which may contain pus and blood. Severe cases can cause fever and even death. The mortality rate of children with dysentery is even higher.

Typhoid Fever: There are typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. This is caused by the infection of typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever bacilli in the human intestines. People with this disease have a high fever, are weak all over, lose weight, and are bedridden. The course of the disease is generally about one month. If treatment is not appropriate, it can lead to death.

Cholera: This is an acute intestinal infectious disease, caused by the infection of cholera vibrio in the human intestines. When sick, one vomits and has diarrhea, and cannot eat or drink. If emergency treatment is not given, death can occur within a few days.

Brucellosis: This disease is caused by the infection of *Salmonella* in the human intestines. This disease is very common in nomadic areas. Sheep can also suffer from this disease. People with the disease have a high fever that lasts for about a month. Patients are bedridden and cannot work, and recovery is also slow.

The pathogens of these diseases are discharged from the body with human feces. Flies suck on these feces, and then go to human food, carrying the germs to the food. People who eat this food become infected. The most important flies for transmitting intestinal infectious diseases are golden blowflies, houseflies, and mountain flies. Other flies can also transmit the disease.

2. Respiratory Infectious Diseases: The most important diseases in this category are tuberculosis and pneumonia. Tuberculosis is caused by tuberculosis bacilli. People with tuberculosis are weak, lose weight, cough, and some have a slight fever. This is a chronic disease, but it is very difficult to cure. Pneumonia is an acute disease, some caused by bacteria and some caused by viruses. People with the disease have high fever, cough, and other symptoms. If treatment is not appropriate or not timely, the mortality rate of this disease is very high.

People with tuberculosis and pneumonia have pathogens in their sputum. Flies suck the sputum and then go to human food, carrying the pathogens to the food. People who eat this food become infected. The most important flies for transmitting this disease are houseflies and mountain flies.

3. Eye Diseases: Trachoma is a disease caused by a virus, and conjunctivitis is a disease caused by bacteria. People with these two eye diseases have red eyes and discharge. When sleeping, especially children, flies often go to the eyes to suck the discharge. These flies then go to the eyes of healthy people to suck, transmitting the disease to them. The most important flies for transmitting eye diseases are houseflies and mountain flies.

4. Neurological Disorders: Among this type of disorder, the disease transmitted by flies is poliomyelitis, also known as infantile paralysis. This is a disease caused by a virus. Children with the disease have symptoms such as fever and coma, and then develop paralysis, especially in the legs. Although the method of transmission is not very clear, it has been proven by experiments that nasal and oral excretions and feces are the source of infection. Flies eat these excretions, absorbing the virus of this disease, and then contaminate human food, and children who eat this food become infected. The most important flies for transmitting this disease are houseflies, mountain flies, and golden blowflies.

5. Skin Diseases: In summer, adults or children often have sores on the exposed parts of their bodies (such as legs, feet, etc.). Places that have been scratched by mosquito or flea bites in the summer are sucked on by flies, which transmit bacteria or spirochetes, causing sores on the skin. Some skin ulcers caused by cocci and yaws caused by spirochetes are transmitted by flies. The most important flies for transmitting these diseases are houseflies and mountain flies.

Flies transmit these diseases in the following ways:

1. External Contamination: Flies have many hairs on their bodies, mouths, and feet. When flies land on substances containing pathogens, such as feces, sputum, pus, etc., they become contaminated with many pathogens.

2. Internal Carrying: As everyone knows, flies eat very dirty items, such as feces, sputum, pus, etc. They eat the pathogens in these dirty things into their stomachs. When flies go to human food or the human body (such as the eyes, skin) to suck, the fly's mouth will spit out some liquid (this liquid is called a vomit drop), and also excrete feces. The vomit drop or feces of flies contain pathogens. These pathogens are transmitted from food or directly to humans.

Our scientists proved several years ago that an ordinary housefly excretes feces nine to forty times in ten hours. It has also been repeatedly seen that vomit droplets appear on the mouthparts of flies. Cultivation has also proven that a fly carries as many as seventeen million bacteria, 90% of flies carry *E. coli*, and 30% of flies carry dysentery bacilli. Different flies can carry different pathogens due to their different habits.

How to Eliminate Flies
There are only three ways to eliminate any insect: manual swatting, eliminating breeding, and using agents. All three of these methods are very important. They should be used comprehensively in the implementation of fly elimination, with the focus on preventing fly breeding.

1. Swatting: Swatting is an important method for eliminating flies. In residences, canteens, hospitals, factories, food workshops, vegetable factories, etc., everyone should take action. Immediately swat flies when you see them, so that the flies in these places can be eliminated and people's safety can be protected. It is especially important to swat large flies in the spring.

2. Eliminating Breeding: This is a more important measure for eliminating flies, because if flies are breeding in large quantities, not only will swatting be very laborious, but it will also be endless, diluting the positive effects of swatting work a lot.

Eliminating fly breeding should start with cleaning up fly breeding grounds near homes.

Indoor and Outdoor Cleaning: Indoor includes residences, kitchens, toilets, livestock rooms, offices, factories, storage rooms, and all other types of buildings. Outdoor includes courtyards, freight yards near courtyards, farms, manure yards, drying yards used by the food industry, and all other types of places. Different organic matter may exist in indoor or outdoor places. If these organic matter have appropriate moisture and temperature, different flies can lay eggs and breed maggots in them. If they are not cleaned regularly, the maggots will become flies. Even in winter, although the weather outside is very cold and not suitable for flies to lay eggs and breed, flies will still breed in warm indoor areas. In the livestock rooms of the northeast and in the indoor areas of other tofu factories, noodle factories, etc. in the north, many flies also breed in the cold winter. Therefore, whether in the warm season or in winter, indoor and outdoor areas should be well cleaned. The garbage cleaned out can be used as fertilizer.

Treatment of Waste and Waste Places: Waste refers to all discarded organic matter. Waste places refer to places where there is often waste or places where waste is stored. The treatment of waste and waste places is extremely important for eliminating fly breeding. Flies lay eggs and breed maggots in discarded organic matter. After these maggots complete their development, they crawl to the surrounding loose soil to pupate, and then hatch into flies. Therefore, not only should the area around the waste be kept clean regularly, but there should also be no loose soil, so as to prevent fly maggots from burrowing into the loose soil to pupate and hatch into flies.

The following principles should be followed to prevent and eliminate flies:

1. Preventing Flies from Laying Eggs: To prevent flies from laying eggs, the cesspools of toilets should be deep and dark, the pit openings should be flush, and tight covers should be added. The feces of livestock such as cattle, horses, and donkeys should be cleaned up in a timely manner and piled together to reduce the area where flies lay their eggs. The garbage cleaned from indoors and outdoors should be placed in covered containers. Animal bones, fur, poultry feathers, etc. should also be placed in containers. If the quantity is large, they can be placed in a room with screen doors and windows, and insecticides such as "223" and "666" can be used to spray and kill flies regularly.

2. Killing Adult Flies: This is an important measure. Although we try to avoid flies laying eggs on human and animal feces or garbage, it is still possible that a certain number of eggs will be laid in them and turn into maggots, so it is extremely important to treat feces and garbage in a timely manner. Human and animal feces are important fertilizers in agriculture, and some components of garbage also have fertilizer value. Recently, Beijing's method of treating coal ash and cleaning substances separately is a good method, because the cleaning substances can be used as fertilizer. Mix human and animal feces and garbage together, add an appropriate amount of chopped grass, pile them together, seal them with mud or put them in a pool. Due to the fermentation effect, heat of 60 to 70 degrees Celsius is generated, which can kill the fly maggots inside. After fermentation, because the organic matter has been decomposed, it no longer attracts flies to lay eggs. The feces and garbage treated in this way can still be used as good fertilizers.

3. Preventing Larvae from Entering the Soil to Pupate: This is also extremely important. The ground around toilets, the ground in livestock pens, and the ground where feces and garbage are stored should be solid, made of hard ground with a mixture of soil, lime, and sand or cement, to prevent fly maggots from burrowing into the soil to become flies. In addition to being hard, the ground where feces and garbage are stored can also have ditches around it to collect the maggots that crawl out to pupate and eliminate them. Some people sprinkle lime in or around toilets, which not only does not kill maggots, but also creates good conditions for fly maggots because the lime surface is the same as loose soil.

4. Eliminating Fly Pupae: If the above three methods are done thoroughly, there will be very few opportunities for fly maggots to pupate. When some of the basic measures mentioned above have not yet been implemented, it is also a remedial method to compact the soil near the breeding ground to prevent pupae from hatching. In addition, pupae can also be dug up, but this method has little effect on fly elimination, and if it is not handled properly, leaving loose soil can better promote fly maggots to burrow in.

5. Using Drugs: The above four methods are the most basic, because these methods prevent and eliminate fly breeding. Without breeding, there will naturally be no flies. However, in some cases, it is also necessary to use some insecticides to make up for the shortcomings of other methods.

In principle, both garbage and feces are substances that must be treated in a timely manner. Using insecticides on these substances not only wastes a lot of drugs, but also wastes a lot of manpower. Various regions in China produce some locally effective plants, which are often used to kill fly maggots in toilets. These plants can be used locally, but new ones need to be added frequently to maintain effectiveness.

The most commonly used insecticides in China now are "666" and "223". These two insecticides are not very effective for fly elimination in garbage and feces, because they are both residual insecticides, and feces and garbage are substances that should be treated in a timely manner. Therefore, "223" and "666" are mainly used to kill adult flies.

These insecticides are sprayed on the walls. Their general dosage is listed in the table below.
Wall Surface Properties	223 Dosage	Concentration	Dosage per Square Meter	223 Content per Square Meter
Water-Absorbing Wall Surface	2.5%	60-80 ml	1.5-2 grams
Non-Water-Absorbing Wall Surface	5%	20-30 ml	1-1.5 grams
Wall Surface Properties	666 Gamma Isomer Dosage	Concentration	Dosage per Square Meter	666 Gamma Isomer Content per Square Meter
Water-Absorbing Wall Surface	0.25%	60-80 ml	0.15-0.2 grams
Non-Water-Absorbing Wall Surface	0.5%	20-30 ml	0.1-0.15 grams

Some necessary indoor areas, such as kitchens, dining rooms, livestock sheds, etc., can be sprayed with either of the above two drugs. Spraying "223" once at the dosage listed in the table can maintain the fly-killing effect for two to three months, while spraying "666" once can maintain it for one to two months. However, it should be noted that if the dosage is insufficient, flies will develop resistance to these insecticides, and the effect will be reduced or ineffective.

Eliminating flies is to eliminate diseases and protect the health of the people. Although there are many types of flies, the most important are the types that breed in human and animal feces, garbage, and other rotting organic matter near homes. In addition to using various methods to eliminate flies in all stages, the most important thing is to clean up indoors and outdoors regularly, and to treat feces and garbage in a timely manner.

    积极消灭苍蝇
    中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所　傅修政
    苍蝇的形态和生活史
    苍蝇是双翅类的昆虫，身体分为头、胸、腹三个部分，胸的两侧有一对翅子。
    大半的苍蝇头是半圆形，前面凸后面平。从头的前面看，上方有两个大的复眼，中部中间有一个窝，里面有一对触角。触角分三节，第一节和第二节短小，第三节长而大，上面有一根毛称为触角芒。苍蝇头的下方正中的口器用来吸取食物。各种蝇类的口器形状都不同。有的只能吸食，称为吸食蝇类（如家蝇），有的能穿刺皮肤，吸取血液，称为吸血蝇类（如厩螫蝇），也有的没有口器，不吃东西，称为不食蝇类（如牛皮下蝇）。
    蝇类的胸部短而宽，两侧生一对翅子，翅膜质透明，除前缘脉和缘下脉外，还有六条纵脉。蝇的腹面生有腿三对，是八节作成的，最末一节有爪一对和爪垫一对。蝇的腹部短而宽，呈长圆形，能看见的有四五节。
    苍蝇有雌有雄。大半雄苍蝇面上两侧的眼靠近中线些，而雌苍蝇的眼就远离中线些。雌雄交配产卵，卵是长圆形，卵孵为幼虫，幼虫普通称为蛆。蝇蛆呈锥形，前端尖，后端齐。幼虫吃食物，生长脱皮两次，第三期幼虫不脱皮，前后收缩而成为蛹，蛹内部发育最后变化为成虫，就是苍蝇。初从蛹内孵出来的苍蝇翅尚未展开，只能爬不能飞，过一些时间翅子展开变硬就能飞翔。这是蝇的一般生活史。
    有些蝇类产出来的卵即刻就孵为蛆，或产出来就是蛆（如某些麻蝇），但大多数的蝇类都产卵，卵再变化而孵为蛆。
    蝇产卵的地方就是幼虫（蛆）孳生的地方，但是由于蝇的种类不同，蝇蛆孳生的地方也很不同。总的来说可分为以下几类：
    1、腐败的有机物质：有动物的粪便，如人、畜和家禽的粪便；腐败的植物性废品，如牲畜、家禽的饲料；豆腐、粉条作业余剩的渣滓、腐草等。这些物质中孳生的蝇类很多。
    2、腐败的动物组织：如畜类、禽鸟类或鱼类等的尸体，兽骨、兽类皮毛、禽类羽毛等。
    3、活动物体上的溃烂伤处：任何动物，包括人和牲畜的身上有了破伤，溃烂有气味，就吸引蝇类在溃烂处产卵生蛆。
    4、活动物的器官：如牛、马、驴等的皮下和胃内，也常有蝇类的蛆寄生。
    常见的蝇类及其习性
    苍蝇的种类很多。就它的大小来说，有形状很小的果蝇，也有形状很大如蜜蜂的食蚜蝇。就它的颜色来说，有灰黑色（如家蝇），有绿色（如绿蝇），也有蓝色（如丽蝇）。就它的性情来说，有的生在野外、田野、树林中，有的生在家庭里或家庭附近。一般说，生在野外杂草中的蝇类，只吃植物花草的液汁，从不靠近人身或接近人的食物，就不重要。但是，生在家庭附近的蝇类，因为它们是传染疾病的一些重要种类，所以要大力消灭的也就是这些种类的苍蝇。
    家庭里和家庭附近的蝇类也有好几种，最常见的和最重要的有以下各种：
    1、家蝇：学名舍蝇，俗称饭蝇或饭蠓，这是因为这种蝇经常成群密集吸食人的饭食而得名。它的身体为灰黑色。它是全国各地的家屋和庭院中最常见、数量最多的一种蝇子，约占家屋、庭院中常见蝇子总数的95％至98％，所以它也就成了所有蝇类的总代表。它的胸部的背面有四条距离几乎相等的等长的黑色纵纹。翅上的第四纵脉向前成角形弯曲，腹的前部色浅，两侧靠近胸部的地方是橘黄色，腹的尾部色渐灰暗，背面的正中并有黑色纵纹。一个雌家蝇每次约可产卵一百到一百五十粒。夏天，特别在我国的南方，雌家蝇每隔六到八天就可产卵一次，除过冬的成蝇以外，一个家蝇可活二月左右，所以一个雌家蝇一生约可产卵十次。家蝇的幼虫变为蛹约需七天，蛹过五天左右就变为成蝇，成蝇从蛹孵出到交尾后再产卵约需四天，所以从卵变到又能交配产卵的成蝇总共约需十五天左右。至于家蝇活动季节的长短，由于我国土地广大，南方和北方是有极大的差别的。在最南边，终年都很温暖，所以家蝇的各个时期终年都可看到，7、8月间是家蝇繁殖最盛的季节，在最北方，只有每年的5月—7月的暖季里才较常见。
    家蝇什么都喜欢吃。从最好最清洁的菜饭直至最脏最臭的人畜粪便，腐烂的动物尸体，它都喜欢吃。人和其他动物的排泄物，如眼屎、痰唾、脓、血等它也吃，生的鱼、肉、蔬菜、咸豆酱、咸菜、糖类、瓜、果等，它也喜欢吃，腐烂变味的菜饭更招引家蝇来吸食。特别在不注意卫生的家庭里和某些特殊的工场里，如血料厂，花炮作，兽骨加工场，养猪场，牛奶厂，糖果面包场，垃圾大粪处理场等地，常常可以看到成群的家蝇密集在未加盖的饭菜上，未洗的盆碗上，血料上，浆糊上，兽骨上，特别是经熬油后的骨渣上，盛牛奶的器具上，随地乱吐的痰唾上，家禽和家畜的食物上，粪便上，在未包扎的或发臭的脓疮上和小儿的眼睛、口角上。家蝇这些复杂的习性与人发生了极为密切的关系，而成为直接或间接传染多种重要疾病的重要蝇子。另外家蝇还有喜欢光的习性，它们常成群的在院内墙边或檐下晒太阳，天黑以后就停止活动。在阴暗的天气和夜晚，它们就停留在天花板（顶棚）上，悬挂的绳索上，电灯线上。
    雌家蝇产卵于各种腐败的植物性有机物中，从卵孵出的幼虫就在其中吃食、长大，如驴、马、猪、牛、鸡、鸭等的粪便，其他新近才腐败发臭的饭菜和垃圾，以及豆腐坊、酱园等所用过的各种粮类的废渣里，都是家蝇最喜吃食的东西，同样也是它最喜产卵的地方。家蝇幼虫的呼吸孔没有特殊的防水构造，所以它不能在有液体浸泡的物质中生长，同样，它也不能吃食相当干燥的物质长大。由于上面所说的那些有机物到处都有，而且数量很多，所以全国各地都有家蝇，而且在家庭里所有蝇种中它的数量也最多。
    南方的气候温暖，冬天也不冷，所以在潮湿而未被液水浸泡的有机物质中经常都可看到家蝇的幼虫，成蝇终年都可产卵繁殖，只是生长过程中的各个时期都延长一些。北方冬季寒冷，家蝇的幼虫甚至蛹都在孳生地及其附近的松土里被冻死，成蝇只能聚集在温暖而又有食物的厨房、饭厅、特殊的工场（如花炮作、油篓厂、牛奶加工场）等地方过冬，同时停止了产卵繁殖，但并不绝对停止活动。屋中温度降低时（10℃以下）它的活动减少，更低时也可被冻死。温度适合时（25℃左右），它极为活跃，也可进行交尾，如果室中长期保持适合的温度，又有适合幼虫孳生的场所，则家蝇仍然可以产卵繁殖。所以家蝇并不是真正的越冬（冬蛰）而是过冬。
    2、山蝇：又名市蝇，它的外形和家蝇很相似，但比家蝇稍小颜色也较浅些。它与家蝇最主要的区别是胸部的背面仅有二条黑色纵纹，这纵纹在前方有不甚明显的分叉，腹部的正中虽然也有黑纵纹，但整个腹部全为深棕色。山蝇喜欢生活在户外，雌蝇喜欢下卵于户外新的人粪、狗粪和牛粪中，所以在这些小的粪堆中，常可发现很多山蝇的幼虫。山蝇是我国山区最常见的蝇子，南方比北方多，平原区比较少些。总的来说，山蝇的习性与家蝇相似，而不同的是山蝇多在室外，幼虫孳生在室外新的小堆的人粪、狗粪和牛粪中。因此，山蝇与人的关系也十分密切，也可传染给人很多种疾病。
    3、大家蝇：学名厩腐蝇，是腐蝇属里常见的一种。它的形状和家蝇相似，但比家蝇大些，颜色也较浅，为暗灰色。大家蝇与家蝇最主要的区别是，它的腿的远端有一半是橘红色，胸部最后的尖端上也是浅橘红色，翅上的第四纵脉不向前呈角形弯曲，而是微向前呈弧形，腹部也完全为深棕色。它常喜聚集在室外的人畜粪便和腐败的菜蔬、瓜、果上吸食。雌蝇也就在这些物质上产卵，因为这些物质同时也是它的幼虫的最好的孳生场所。大家蝇是牛、驴和马的棚舍中最常见的蝇种，它一般不喜欢进入人住的家屋里，但也常发现它在厨房和饭厅里。同时它不喜太热和太冷的季节，所以春秋多而夏季少，在冬天雌蝇是在潮湿而不通风的暗处越冬。大家蝇在全国各地都有，在西北较多。
    4、厕蝇：最常见的有二种。它的外形和家蝇相似，但比家蝇小些。它与家蝇的主要区别点是，它的触角芒光滑无毛，翅上第四纵脉直。厕蝇在厕所中最多，室内外也常发现。它的成虫的特性是常在空中飞翔，但位置并不移动，它很少停留在食物上吸食。厕蝇最喜欢在粪坑中下卵，特别在人的粪尿混合的粪池里最多。它与人的关系不大密切。
    5、大头金蝇：它的身体呈绿蓝色，短而肥胖，飞行不十分敏捷。这种蝇头大，眼也大而鲜红，所以又称它为红头蝇。它最喜欢吃味甜和腥臭的食物，如切开的或腐烂的生食瓜类、水果、腥臭的鱼和肉类等。稀而鲜的人粪上更常见到它去吸食和产卵。由于它有着这种较为特殊的习性，所以大头金蝇也成为重要的传染病媒介，特别是传播霍乱、痢疾和伤寒等肠道传染病。
    大头金蝇的幼虫最主要的孳生处所是经常有人大便的半稀和稀的粪池、粪坑和粪缸中，在这些地方可以见到成堆大头金蝇的幼虫。此外，它也可在鲜而稀的猪粪中生长。大头金蝇在全国各地都有，北方少，南方多，在公共厕所管理得不好的村镇这种蝇最多。大头金蝇的成蝇，在南方5月—10月都可见到，而以8月最多，北方温热的季节短，所以成蝇只在7月前后出现，东北和西北因为没有存留稀人粪的习惯，气候又冷，所以大头金蝇极少。
    大头金蝇的生活史是比较特殊的，它的幼虫发育很快，幼虫从卵孵出后四天左右即长大成熟而变蛹，除越冬的以外，蛹期也只有四天左右，所以大头金蝇整个生长过程只有一周多。
    大头金蝇是以蛹越冬的，越冬的处所是它的幼虫孳生处所的缝隙、墙缝和附近的松土中。
    6、绿蝇：俗名绿豆蝇。这种蝇的胸部和腹部都为灿烂的铜绿或青铜色，故又称为灿蝇。它包括很多种类，最多的是丝光绿蝇（又称银绿蝇）和凯撒绿蝇两种。它的身体比大头金蝇小些，飞行也较敏捷，头和眼都较小而不甚红，与大头金蝇很容易区别。这两种绿蝇最喜欢食腥臭的动物尸体和腥臭鱼虾，所以它在鱼场、兽骨、皮毛、鸡鸭毛、猪鬃等加工场和有腐臭的动物尸体的处所最多，室外的人和狗的粪便上也常看见它。雌蝇只在含有腐肉的物质上产卵，幼虫也只能在这些物质中取食腐肉而生长，长大成熟后就爬到附近较干松的土中变蛹。由卵发育到成蝇约需十二天。绿蝇一般不喜欢进入室内。丝光绿蝇是以成熟的幼虫在孳生处所近旁的土中越冬，次年春天再变蛹而后孵为成蝇。丝光绿蝇和凯撒绿蝇全国各地都有，而以腥臭的场所最多。
    7、丽蝇：又名青蝇。这种蝇包括好几种。它的身体比家蝇大二到三倍，胸部为青黑色并有黑纵纹，腹部为深蓝绿色，因此，它与绿蝇不难区别。在我国各地常见的种类为格氏丽蝇、红头丽蝇和反吐丽蝇三种。成蝇在正常情形下不入室内。前两种成蝇常出现于厕所、垃圾堆、人畜的粪便和动物尸体上，也喜欢接近食物，如水果、糖食等。格氏丽蝇的幼虫主要与大头金蝇一样，孳生于半稀和稀的新人粪中，也孳生于牛、猪等畜粪、垃圾、兽骨、皮毛和动物尸体等的腐肉上。红头丽蝇和反吐丽蝇的幼虫主要的却是孳生于含有腐肉的物质中，所以这两种丽蝇的幼虫常和丝光绿蝇的幼虫在同一处所发现。只不过它在数量上要比绿蝇少得多。常见的丽蝇主要是以成熟的幼虫在孳生地附近的潮而松的土中越冬，少数的蛹也可越冬。
    8、麻蝇：这种蝇也包括很多种。大多数麻蝇的身体都比丽蝇稍大，麻灰色，胸部背面有清楚的三条黑色纵纹，腹部背面有随观察方向不同而变形的棋盘形黑斑。在我国家庭里最常见的一种是褐尾麻蝇，它喜欢吃人粪和发酵的植物性食物，如豆酱、咸菜等，腥臭的鱼和肉上也可见到它。它的幼虫主要孳生于稀人粪中，往往和大头金蝇的幼虫生长在一起，但它也可生长在酱缸、咸菜和腐肉里，所以又常称为肉蝇。麻蝇常出现于酱园工场，鱼和肉的市场上，但它不进入室内。麻蝇是以蝇越冬的，往往同大头金蝇的蛹在同处越冬。
    以上各种蝇子中，在各地家庭中最常见的是家蝇，室外最多见的是大头金蝇，山区室外以山蝇为最多，大家蝇以牛、马棚舍最多，厕蝇在厕所中多见。其他几种蝇子只有在较为特殊的环境中才最多，如绿蝇和丽蝇在兽骨、皮毛、猪鬃和鸡鸭毛的加工场最多，养狗场由于常有大量鲜狗粪，绿蝇也不少。麻蝇在酱园作坊较多。当然，这几种蝇子也可发现于庭院中，但数量极少。因此，从成蝇的习性和数量上来看，家蝇、大头金蝇和山蝇与人的关系最为密切，所以它们是人类某些疾病特别是肠胃传染病的主要传播者。
    从上面所提的八种家庭内最常见的最重要的苍蝇，就可以知道家庭附近所以有这些苍蝇，是因为环境卫生没有搞好，家庭附近如果存在着人、畜、家禽的粪便，植物性的物质，如牲畜、家禽的食物废渣，以及腐烂植物，如菜蔬的叶子，坏了的瓜果，腐败的动物产品如兽骨、皮毛、羽毛等等，都会产生这些苍蝇。这些废弃的物品除了产生上述八类蝇子外，还产生其他一些种类的苍蝇。
    苍蝇传染的疾病及其传染的方法
    苍蝇是非常污秽的。它们所以能够传染疾病也就是由于这种污秽的习性。苍蝇能够传染五类疾病。
    1，肠胃传染病：
    痢疾　有杆菌痢疾和阿米巴痢疾，这种病是由于人的肠子里染有痢疾杆菌或阿米巴所致。人患痢疾的时候大便次数很多，大便里可以带脓带血，重的可以发烧甚至于死亡。小孩患痢疾死亡率更高。
    伤寒　有正伤寒和副伤寒两种，这是由于人的肠子里传染上了伤寒或副伤寒秆菌所致。人得这种病的时候发高烧，全身无力，消瘦，卧床不起，病程一般约在一个月左右。治疗如不得法就可以死亡。
    霍乱　这是急性肠胃传染病，是由于人的肠内传染上霍乱弧菌所致。得病时上吐下泻，不能饮食，如不紧急治疗，数日内即可死亡。
    波浪热　这种病是由于人的肠内染上了沙门氏杆菌。这种病在游牧地区很常见，羊也会患这种病。患病的人发高热持续约一月之久，病人卧床不能工作，恢复也很慢。
    以上这些疾病的病原体随着人的粪便排到体外，苍蝇在这样的粪便上吸食，再到人的食物上去，就把病菌带到食物上去，人吃了这样的食物就传染上了病。传染肠胃传染病最重要的苍蝇有大头金蝇、家蝇和山蝇等，其他苍蝇也能传染。
    2，呼吸道传染病：这类疾病中最重要的有肺结核病和肺炎病。肺结核病是结核杆菌所致。患结核病的人，身体无力，消瘦，咳嗽，有的有轻度发烧。这是一种慢性病，但很不容易好。肺炎是一种急性病，有的由细菌所致，有的由病毒所致。人得病后，有高度发烧、咳嗽等症状。这种病，治疗不当或不及时，死亡率很高。
    患肺结核病和肺炎病者吐的痰内都有病原体，苍蝇吸食痰液再到人的食物上去，就把病原体带到食物上，人吃了这样的食物就受了传染。传染这病的最重要的是家蝇和山蝇。
    3，眼的疾病：沙眼是病毒所致的病，结合膜炎是细菌所致的病。患这两种眼病的人眼发红，流眼屎，在睡觉的时候，尤其小孩，常有苍蝇到眼上去吸食眼屎，这些苍蝇再到健康的人的眼上吸食，就把这病传染给他了。传染眼病的苍蝇最重要的是家蝇和山蝇。
    4，神经疾患：这一类疾患中，被苍蝇传染的疾病是脊髓灰白质炎，又称小儿麻痹症。这是病毒所致的病。小儿得病后，有发烧、昏迷等症状，后来就发生瘫痪症状，尤其是腿部。虽然传染的方法还不十分明了，但是经试验证明，口鼻排泄物和粪便是传染的来源。苍蝇吃了这些排泄物，就吸取了这种病的病毒，再到人的食物上使食物受染，小孩吃了这食物就受了感染。传染这种病最重要的是家蝇、山蝇和大头金蝇。
    5，皮肤疾患：在夏天的时候，大人或小孩的身体暴露部分（如腿、足等），常有生疮的事情。夏天因蚊虫或蚤类叮咬而抓破了的地方，苍蝇在上面吸食就传染上细菌或螺旋体，因而使皮肤上生疮。有些球菌所致的皮肤溃疡和螺旋体所致的莓疮都是由苍蝇传染的。传染这类疾病最重要的苍蝇是家蝇和山蝇。
    苍蝇传染这些疾病有下面一些方法。
    1、体外沾染：苍蝇的身体上、嘴上和脚上有很多毛。当苍蝇落在含有病原体的物质上的时候如粪便、痰液、脓液等就沾上了很多的病原体。
    2、体内携带：大家知道苍蝇吃很脏的物品，如粪便、痰液、脓液等，它把这些脏东西里面的病原体也吃到它的肚子里去。当苍蝇再到人的食物上或是人的身上
  （如眼上、皮肤上）吸食的时候，苍蝇的嘴里会吐出一些液体（这些液体称为吐滴），同时也排出大便。苍蝇的吐滴里或大便里都含有病原体。这些病原体从食物或直接传染给人。
    我们的科学家在数年前证明，一个普通家蝇在十小时内排泄粪便九—四十次。同时也屡次看见吐滴出现在苍蝇的口吻上。通过培养也证明，一个苍蝇携带的细菌达一千七百万个，有90％的苍蝇携带着大肠杆菌，30％的苍蝇携带着痢疾杆菌。不同的苍蝇由于它的习性不同，可以携带不同的病原体。
            怎样消灭苍蝇
    消灭任何昆虫，都不外乎三种方法，就是：人工扑打、消灭孳生和使用药剂。这三种方法都很重要，在灭蝇的实施中应当综合使用，而重点应当放在制止蝇类的孳生上。
    1、捕打：捕打是消灭苍蝇的一种重要方法，在居室、食堂、病院、厂房、食物工作间、菜厂等地方，人人动手，看到苍蝇立即捕打，这样就能把这些地方的苍蝇消灭净尽，保护了人的安全。春天捕打大苍蝇尤为重要。
    2、消灭孳生：这是消灭苍蝇的更重要的措施，因为如果苍蝇在大量孳生着，不但捕打工作十分费力，而且将是打不胜打，使捕打工作的积极效果冲淡了很多。
    消灭苍蝇孳生应该从清理家庭附近的蝇类的孳生场所入手。
    室内外清扫　室内包括居室、厨房、厕所、牲畜房、办公室、厂房、储藏室，以及一切其他类型的房屋。室外包括庭院，庭院附近的货站、农场、粪场、食品工业所用的晒场，以及其他一切类型的场所。室内或室外的场所都可能有不同的有机物质存在。这些有机物质如果有适当的潮度及温度都可以有不同的蝇类在内产卵生蛆，如果不经常打扫干净，蛆就变为苍蝇，就是在冬季里，外面天气虽然很冷不适于苍蝇产卵和孳生，但在暖和的室内苍蝇仍会孳生。在东北的牲畜房里和北方其他地区的豆腐房、粉房等室内，在严寒的冬天也有很多苍蝇孳生。因此，不论在暖季或冬季都应当很好地清扫室内外。清扫出来的垃圾可以作肥料。
    废物和废物场所的处理　废物是指废弃了的一切有机物质。废物场所指经常有废物的地方或存储废物的地方。废物和废物场所的处理对于消灭苍蝇的孳生有极重要的关系。苍蝇在废弃的有机物质里产卵生蛆。这些蛆发育完成以后就爬到周围的松土内变蛹，然后再孵化为苍蝇，所以废物周围的场所不但应该经常保持清洁，而且也应当没有松土，以免蝇蛆钻进松土变蛹，孵为苍蝇。
    防止和消灭苍蝇有下面一些原则：
    1、防止蝇类产卵：为了防止蝇类产卵，厕所的粪坑应当深而暗，坑口应当平齐，并且加严密的盖。牛、马、驴等牲畜的粪便，应该及时清扫，堆在一块，使苍蝇产卵的面积减少。从室内外清扫出来的垃圾，应当放在有盖的容器中。兽骨、皮毛、禽羽等也应放入容器中。如果量大，可放入有纱门纱窗的室内，按时用“二二三”、“六六六”等杀虫剂喷射杀蝇。
    2、杀死成蝇：这是一个重要的措施。虽然尽量避免蝇类在人畜粪便或垃圾上面产卵，但是仍有可能有一定数量的卵产在里面变成了蛆，因此及时的对粪便和垃圾加以处理是极为重要的。人畜粪便是农业上的重要肥料，垃圾里的某些成分也有肥料价值。最近北京市把煤灰和清扫的物质分开处理是很好的办法，因为清扫的物质就可以作为肥料。将人畜粪便和垃圾掺合起来，加上适量的碎草堆在一起，用泥封或装在池子里，由于发酵作用生摄氏六十度至七十度的热力，可以把里面的蝇蛆杀死。发酵以后由于有机物质已经分解，就不再吸引蝇来产卵，经过这样处理的粪便和垃圾，仍可以作为很好的肥料。
    3、防止幼虫入土变蛹：这也是极为重要的。厕所周围，牲畜圈舍的地面，存储粪便和垃圾的地面，都应当坚实，用三合土或水泥作成坚硬的地面，以防止蝇蛆钻入土内变蝇。存储粪类和垃圾的地面除了坚硬之外，也可以在四周作上沟，收集爬出来要变蛹的蛆加以消灭。有人在厕所里或厕所周围撒上石灰，这不但没有杀蛆作用，而且因石灰面和松土一样，反而给蝇蛆造成了良好的条件。
    4、消灭蝇蛹：如果上述的三种方法作的彻底，蝇蛆变蛹的机会就很少。在还没有作到上述的一些基本措施的时候，把孳生地附近的土打紧使蛹不能孵出也是补救的一个方法。另外也可以挖蛹，但是这个方法对灭蝇来说作用是不大的，而且如果处理不好留下松土，更能促使蝇蛆钻入。
    5、使用药物：以上四种方法是最基本的，因为这些方法是防止与消灭苍蝇的孳生。没有了孳生自然也就没有苍蝇。但是在某些情况下也有必要用一些杀虫剂来补其他方法之不足。
    从原则来说，无论是垃圾或粪便都是必须及时处理的物质，在这些物质上使用杀虫剂不但浪费药品很多，而且也浪费很多人力。我国各地都出产一些本地使用有效的植物，常用来杀厕所里的蝇蛆，这些植物可以就地取材的加以利用，但需要时常加上新的以保持效力。
    我国现在最常用的杀虫剂是六六六和二二三，这两种杀虫剂对垃圾与粪便的灭蝇效力是不大的，因为它们都是滞留性的杀虫剂，而粪便与垃圾都是应当及时处理的物质，因此二二三与六六六主要用在杀灭成蝇上。
    这些杀虫剂都是喷在墙面，它们的一般用量如下表所列。墙面性质  二二三用量  浓度  每平方公尺用量  每平方公尺含二二三量  吸水的墙面  2.5％  60—80毫升  1.5—2公分  不吸水的墙面  5％  20—30毫升  1—1.5公分墙面性质  六六六丙体用量  浓度  每平方公尺用量  每平方公尺含丙体六六六量  吸水的墙面  0.25％  60—80毫升  0.15—0.2公分不吸水的墙面  0.5％  20—30毫升  0.1—0.15公分
    有些必要的室内如厨房、饭厅、牲畜棚舍等等，可以用上述二种中的任何一种药物来喷射，就表内所列的剂量喷一次二二三可以维持杀蝇效力二到三个月，而喷一次六六六可以维持一到二个月。但应当注意如用药量不足，苍蝇对这些杀虫药会发生抗药性，效力就会减小或无效力。
    消灭苍蝇是为了消灭疾病，保护人民的健康。苍蝇种类虽然很多，但最重要的是家庭附近，孳生在人畜粪便、垃圾和其他腐败有机物质内的一些种类。除了用各种方法对苍蝇的各个时期加以消灭外，最重要的是户内户外经常打扫，粪便、垃圾及时处理。
