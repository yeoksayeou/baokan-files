Comrade Wu Han reports on Beijing's Patriotic Health Campaign Centered on Eliminating the Four Pests: He says: We will make the most civilized contribution to world civilization with the most civilized country and the most civilized people.

I completely agree with the reports made to the Congress by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now, I will briefly speak to the Congress about the revolutionary spirit of the working people of Beijing in launching the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, as well as the new initiatives and new atmosphere in commercial work:

	Wave Upon Wave, Each Batch Surpassing the Previous One, Guaranteeing That the Deadline for Achieving a "Four-Free" Status Is Shortened Again and Again
Since the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests began last December, it has entered a new high tide, with a grand momentum and swift action. During the first blitz week, 150,000 people took to the streets to promote the campaign in two days. The elimination of the four pests has been spread among the masses, and every household has been engaged in a major clean-up. In a few days, most parts of the city have achieved the elimination of mosquitoes and flies, with a completely new look. Because the broad masses of citizens have further recognized the great significance of eliminating the four pests, the importance of hygiene in protecting people's health and serving production, their enthusiasm has become even greater. As soon as the first surge passed, a new high tide of fervent competition was launched.

	In mid-January this year, the city held an 8,000-person oath-taking competition meeting. All districts, agencies, schools, and troops in the urban and suburban areas eagerly joined the competition. Before this, many units had already formulated plans to accelerate the elimination of the four pests. Wave upon wave, batch after batch, successive challenge letters and resolutions flew to the districts and the city like snowflakes. The conditions were raised higher and higher, and the deadline for guaranteeing a "four-free" status was shortened again and again. Originally, we estimated that it would take about two years to basically eliminate the "four pests" and bedbugs, that is, eliminate the five pests. However, with the rapid development of the campaign on such a scale, the time may be shortened. Qianmen District proposed to achieve a "four-free" status within one year, and Dongsi and Xidan Districts responded by eliminating the four pests in nine months. Xuanwu District said it would only take half a year, and Xisi District said four months would be enough. These facts fully demonstrate the determination and enthusiasm of the people of the capital to eliminate the four pests. Everyone is competing with each other. Regardless of gender, age, city, or countryside, people are actively participating in the competition, comparing their efforts, results, and consistency.

	Eliminating Two Million Rats and Sparrows, Many Regions and Units Achieve a "Four-Free" Status
The broad masses of people did what they said they would do. After the residents of Fusui Jing in Xisi District captured all the sparrows and rats, they used their hands to mix mud and block sparrow nests and rat holes in the severe cold of minus 22 degrees Celsius. Ding Zhongde, a blind young man in the East Suburb District, personally caught nine sparrows and also carried elementary school students to catch more than a dozen on the eaves. Chang De, an 85-year-old man in Chongwen District, has used a net to catch more than 30,000 sparrows this winter. His brother, Chang Ming, has also caught more than 20,000. Chang De's daughter's wedding bedding is all filled with sparrow feathers. The farmers carry fire guns to the fields and shoot sparrows during their breaks. Two farmers shot 12,000 sparrows this winter. An office in a Dongsi District street mobilized more than 1,400 people and 66 large carts in two days to fill and pave more than 70 stagnant water pits where mosquitoes breed, without spending a penny of the state's money.

	In order to kill rats, the masses bought more than one million packages of "Antu" poison, and some residents poisoned it as many as seven or eight times. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army carried dry food and went to the countryside to help farmers turn over firewood stacks and dig out rats. A colonel also helped an old couple with a major clean-up, clearing out the garbage in the house that had not been cleaned for more than 20 years. Such touching examples are countless and cannot be fully described.

	After more than two months of hard work, urban and rural residents have eliminated more than 1.05 million rats and more than 1.06 million sparrows. Forty-six street offices, 252 neighborhood committees, 15 townships and communes, 178 factories, 321 schools, and 406 agencies, a total of more than 6,300 regions and units, in places with a population of 1.6 million, have successively reported good news and achieved a "four-free" status!

	Eliminating the Four Pests Closely Integrated with Production to Serve Production: Manure and Dirty Soil Become Fertilizer, and Stinky Pits Become Fish Ponds
It should be pointed out that our elimination of the four pests is closely integrated with production and serves production. For example, two elementary school students in Changping carry brooms and manure baskets every day on their way to school, sweeping up livestock manure and dirty soil along the way, accumulating 10,000 catties of fertilizer this winter. The farmers say, "The broom sounds, the manure pile grows." In the past, the urban area had 940 tons of manure and 2,800 tons of garbage every day, which were transported to the suburbs for open-air storage. The stench was pungent, and flies were swarming, which the nearby residents could not bear. Now, farmers use the "mud-sealed composting" method to pile manure and organic waste together, pouring a layer of manure on a layer of organic waste, piling it up to about the height of a person, and sealing the outside with yellow mud. This allows it to ferment to 70 degrees Celsius, improving the effectiveness of the fertilizer, eliminating insect eggs, preventing flies from breeding, and increasing fertilizer by 900 million catties a year. In order to eliminate the breeding conditions for mosquitoes, the 18th Village Township of Nanyuan District processed and renovated four stinky pits and converted them into fish ponds.

	In many places where the elimination of the four pests and hygiene are well done, customs have truly changed, and everyone is invigorated. The situation in Yongfengtun Township, Changping District, before liberation: garbage was everywhere in the streets, dust was flying in the rooms, rats were running around, and flies and mosquitoes were rampant. Now, the farmers in this township sweep the public streets first, then their own courtyards and houses, as soon as it dawns. The whole township has clean streets, with no garbage in sight, and rats, flies, and mosquitoes have been basically eliminated. The farmers are all full of energy. They say, "Hygiene is good, the body is strong, work, work, work, and in one breath to the Yellow River!" (referring to production targets).

	Although great achievements have been made in eliminating the four pests, there are still many difficulties. Some people put the poisoned bait into the rat holes, and the rats pushed it out again. In some places, the sparrows are afraid of being shot by the soldiers, and they fly away as soon as they see people wearing military uniforms. As for flies, mosquitoes, and bedbugs, they reproduce quickly and in large numbers, and it is not easy to completely eliminate their breeding conditions. However, the devil is one foot tall, and the Tao is ten feet tall. Our people are laying a net of heaven and earth from all directions, and we must make it impossible for them to go to heaven or enter the earth, and completely eliminate them.

	Representatives: Completely and thoroughly eliminating these five types of enemies—mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, and bedbugs—although human history has gone through hundreds of thousands of years, it can be believed that no one has ever dared to make such a determination, let alone be able to do so, and be able to mobilize all the people to do it. Only in our era, the era of Mao Zedong, only people like us, people of the Mao Zedong era, not only said so, but also did so. Not only did so, but also will definitely do it well. This is a great cause that our predecessors did not dare to dream of. This is a great cause that our generation is about to realize. This is an extremely arduous cause, but it is also an extremely civilized cause. We will make the most civilized contribution to the people of the world with the most civilized country and the most civilized people.

    首都布下天罗地网　鼠雀蚊蝇无处躲藏
    吴晗代表报告北京市开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，他说：我们将以最文明的国家、最文明的人民，对世界文明做出最文明的贡献
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。现在我仅就北京市劳动人民鼓起革命干劲，开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的情况，和商业工作中的新倡议、新气象，向大会作一个简要发言：
    一浪高过一浪　一批赶过一批  保证做到四无的期限越提越短
    以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动从去年十二月开始以来，进入了新的高潮，声势浩大、雷厉风行。在第一次突击周中，两天里就出动了十五万人上街宣传。在广大群众中人人传诵除四害，家家动手大扫除。几天功夫，全市绝大部分地方做到了蚊蝇绝迹，面貌一新。由于广大市民进一步认识到除四害的重大意义，讲卫生保卫人民健康和为生产服务的道理，劲头越发大了。第一个突击浪潮刚过，又掀起了一个热火朝天大竞赛的高潮。
    今年一月中旬，全市召开了八千人的誓师竞赛大会，城郊各地区、各机关、学校、部队都争先恐后地投入了竞赛运动。在这以前，很多单位已经制定了加快地消灭四害的计划。一浪高过一浪，一批赶过一批，接二连三的挑战应战书和决心书，像雪片一样飞到各区和市里来，条件越提越高，保证做到“四无”的期限越提越短。原来我们估计，要基本上消灭“四害”和臭虫，即消灭五害，大概需要两年左右时间，但是，运动以这样的规模迅速地发展，时间还可能缩短，前门区提出要在一年内作到“四无”，东四、西单区就以九个月消灭四害来作回答；宣武区说只要半年就行；西四区便说四个月就足够了。这些事实，充分表现出了首都人民群众消灭四害的决心和积极性。真是一个赛过一个。人不分男女老幼，地不分城市乡村，都以比干劲，比效果，比经常，积极地参加到竞赛运动中来。
    消灭老鼠麻雀二百万只  许多地区单位做到四无
    广大群众说了就做，西四区福绥境的居民捉光了麻雀老鼠以后，在零下二十二度的严寒里，用双手和泥堵雀窝、塞鼠洞。东郊区双目失明的青年丁仲德，亲手捉了九只麻雀，还抗着小学生在房檐上捉了十几只。崇文区八十五岁的老人常德，一冬来用线网捕了三万多只麻雀，他的兄弟常明，也打了两万多只，常德嫁女儿的被褥都是用雀毛絮的。农民们背着火枪下地，歇晌的时候就打麻雀。有两个农民一冬打了一万二千只麻雀。东四区一个街道的办事处，两天就出动了一千四百多人和六十六辆大车，填垫了七十多个孳生蚊子的积水坑洼，没有用国家一个钱。
    为了灭鼠，群众买了一百多万包“安妥”药，有些居民投药七、八次之多。解放军官兵背着干粮，下乡帮助农民翻柴垛、挖老鼠。还有一个上校军官帮助一对老夫妇大扫除，把屋内二十多年没扫的垃圾，都清理出来。这种动人的事例数不清，也说不完。
    经过两个多月的苦战，城乡居民消灭了老鼠一百零五万多只，麻雀一百零六万多只，有四十六个街道办事处，二百五十二个居民委员会，十五个乡、社，一百七十八个工厂，三百二十一个学校和四百零六个机关，共六千三百多个地区和单位，一百六十万人口的地方，先后报捷，做到“四无”了！
    除四害紧紧结合生产为生产服务  粪便脏土成肥料臭水坑变养鱼塘
    应该指出，我们的除四害是和生产紧紧结合的，是为生产服务的。例如，昌平有两个小学生每天上学的时候，都带着篠帚、粪筐，沿路扫牲口粪和脏土，一冬积肥一万斤。农民说：“篠帚响，粪堆长。”过去，城区每天有九百四十吨粪便和二千八百吨垃圾，运到郊区露天存放，臭气扑鼻，苍蝇成群，附近居民熏得受不了。现在农民用“泥封堆肥”法，把粪便和有机垃圾堆在一起，一层有机垃圾浇上一层粪便，堆到大约一人高的样子，外面封上黄泥，这样便可发酵到摄氏七十度，提高了肥料效力，也消灭了虫卵，使苍蝇不能孳生，并且一年可以增加九亿斤肥料。南苑区十八里店乡为了消灭孳生蚊子的条件，把四个臭水坑加工修整，改作鱼塘。
    许多除四害、讲卫生做得好的地方，真做到了移风易俗、人人振奋。昌平区永丰屯乡解放前的情况：街头垃圾遍地、室内灰尘飞扬、老鼠到处乱窜、苍蝇蚊子猖狂。现在这个乡的农民，天一亮，先扫公共的街道，后扫自己的院子、屋里，全乡做到条条街道整洁，看不到一点垃圾，老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子基本灭绝，农民个个精神饱满，他们说：“卫生搞好、身子强，干、干、干一气黄河南！”（指产量指标）。
    虽然，除四害已经取得很大成绩，但是，困难还是不少。有的人把药饵投进鼠洞，老鼠又把它推了出来；有些地方的麻雀叫战士打怕了，看见穿军服的就一溜烟飞走。至于苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫繁殖得又多、又快，要全面彻底消灭它们的孳生条件并不很容易。可是，魔高一尺、道高一丈，我们人民群众正从四面八方，布下天罗地网，一定要搞得它上天无路，入地无门，彻底消灭干净。
    代表们：全面地彻底地消灭蚊子、苍蝇、老鼠、麻雀、臭虫这五类敌人，虽然人类历史经历了几十万年了，但是，可以确信，从来没有人曾经敢于下过这样的决心，更说不到能够这样做，能够发动全体人民来做。只有我们这个时代，毛泽东的时代，只有我们这样的人，毛泽东时代的人，不但这样说了，而且这样做了。不但这样做了，而且一定可以做好。这是一椿我们前人所不敢梦想的伟大事业，这是我们这一代人就要实现的伟大事业。这是一椿极其艰巨的事业，但是，也是一椿极其文明的事业。我们将以最文明的国家，最文明的人民，对世界人民做出最文明的贡献。
