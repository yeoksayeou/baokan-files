　　Amazing Achievements
　　Gu Youchang, a sanitation advanced worker first class in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, and a dockworker, has achieved amazing results in the Eliminate-Four-Pests campaign. In 1957, he single-handedly eliminated more than 2,600 rats, more than 4,700 sparrows, 90 jin of flies, 25 jin and 10 liang of pupae, and 31 jin of maggots, averaging seven rats, thirteen sparrows, and six liang of flies, pupae and maggots eliminated per day.

　　As early as the summer of 1952, Gu Youchang responded to the call from higher authorities by purchasing rat traps, fly swatters, and making fly cages to fight against rats, flies, and other pests. He used old iron mesh to make two fly cages, placing fish intestines, pear peels, shrimp shells, and other smelly items inside as bait. In the morning, he placed the cages in toilets and vegetable markets, and in the evening, he took them back. Each cage caught more than half a jin of flies per day. When catching rats, he often worked until late at night before resting.

　　Gu Youchang has always paid attention to mobilizing the masses to carry out the Eliminate-Four-Pests and hygiene campaigns. More than 300 households of family members in the Transportation Brigade of the Wuhu City Transportation Company, influenced and driven by him, are able to pay attention to eliminating the four pests at any time and any place, and every household is cleaned spotlessly, with good environmental hygiene.

　　From 1952 to now, Gu Youchang has persisted in eliminating the four pests for six years without interruption, and has been twice rated as a first-class advanced sanitation worker in Wuhu City and once as a second-class sanitation model in Anhui Province.

　　Three Years Without Interruption
　　Cai Yueying, a 72-year-old woman from Anjing Street in Wuhan City, has persisted in eliminating the "four pests" for three years without interruption.

　　In 1955, after hearing a mobilization report on eliminating the "four pests" on the street, Cai Yueying enthusiastically joined the Eliminate-Four-Pests campaign. She first purchased rat traps and set up a rat-catching network at home, catching dozens of rats in a row. Later, the number of rats gradually decreased, but they did not disappear completely. She often quietly climbed onto the plank buildings at night to destroy rat nests; she also used boiling water to scald rat holes, eliminating the rats in the burrows. She never relaxed her efforts against flies and mosquitoes. In addition to frequently swatting mosquitoes and flies inside and outside her own house, she also insisted on going to nearby garbage dumps and street corners every morning and afternoon to swat mosquitoes and flies. In the past three years, she alone has eliminated more than 330 rats and 2.4 million flies. She also actively organized young children aged seven to twelve on the street, leading them to participate in fly-catching activities every morning and evening, eliminating a large number of mosquitoes and flies, and expanding the achievements of the Eliminate-Four-Pests campaign. For the Anjing Street Grain Store, which did not pay much attention to rat-catching, she also provided her own rat-catching tools and bait and personally helped them eliminate rats. She has been rated as a city and district patriotic hygiene model five times.

　　Persisting in Rat-Catching in Spare Time
　　Yu Xiaozhang, a Eliminate-Four-Pests model and rat-catching expert in Guizhou Province, is a worker at Guiyang City No. 3 Middle School. After finishing his work in the school every morning, he spends about an hour collecting the rat-catching boards he had placed the day before, carefully washing them to remove the fishy smell; when he gets off work in the afternoon, he first places the rat-catching boards in nearby food processing shops and other places where rats often appear, and then goes home for dinner. He has bought a total of 110 rat-catching boards, and now regularly uses more than 40. Since he started catching rats, the best day he ever had was catching 48 rats, and once he caught five rats on one board. Usually, he catches more than 20 rats every day. From April of the year before last to now, he has killed more than 10,200 rats.

　　In addition to actively catching rats himself, Yu Xiaozhang also shares his rat-catching experience with others, helping them improve their rat-catching skills. Currently, he is working with residents of his street to study how to further search and catch rats, so that the street can become a rat-free street.

　　Due to his excellent rat-catching achievements, he was successively rated as a Eliminate-Four-Pests model in Guiyang City and Guizhou Province last June, and received medals, certificates and bonuses.

　　除四害英雄榜
　　惊人的战果
    安徽省芜湖市一等卫生先进工作者、搬运工人顾友昌，在除四害战线上获得惊人的战果。1957年中，他一人消灭老鼠二千六百多只，麻雀四千七百多只，苍蝇九十斤，挖蛹二十五斤十两，蛆三十一斤，平均每天消灭七只老鼠，十三只麻雀，六两苍蝇和蛆蛹。
    远在1952年夏天，顾友昌就响应上级号召，购买鼠夹、蝇拍，制造蝇笼，和老鼠、苍蝇等作斗争。他用旧铁纱网做了两个蝇笼，笼内放些鱼肠、梨皮、虾壳等腥臭物作诱饵，早晨把笼放在厕所、菜市场等地，晚上把笼取回，每个笼子每天捉到苍蝇半斤以上。捕鼠时，他时常忙到深夜才休息。
    顾友昌一直注意发动群众开展除四害、讲卫生的工作。芜湖市搬运公司运输大队三百多户家属，由于他的影响和带动，都能做到随时随地注意消灭四害，而且家家户户打扫得干干净净，环境卫生搞得很好。
    从1952年到现在，顾友昌六年如一日，除四害从未间断过，曾先后两次被评为芜湖市一等卫生先进工作者，一次被评为安徽省二等卫生模范。
    三年如一日
    武汉市安静街一位七十二岁的老太太蔡月英，三年如一日地坚持除“四害”。
    1955年，蔡月英在街道上听到除“四害”动员报告后，就热情地投入除“四害”活动。她首先购置捕鼠夹子，在家里布下捕鼠网，一连打了几十只老鼠。后来老鼠逐渐少了，但并没有绝迹。她经常在夜间悄悄地爬上板楼，捣毁老鼠的巢穴；又用开水烫鼠洞，消灭了地洞里的老鼠。对于苍蝇、蚊子，她也从不放松。除了经常扑灭自己屋内外的蚊蝇以外，还坚持每天清早和下午到附近垃圾堆、街头巷尾去扑灭蚊蝇。三年来，她一个人就消灭了三百三十多只老鼠、两百四十万只苍蝇。她还积极地把街道七岁到十二岁的少年儿童组织起来，每天早、晚带领着他们去参加捕蝇活动，消灭了大批的蚊、蝇，扩大了除四害的成果。对于不大重视捕鼠的安静街粮店，她也自备了打鼠工具和饵子，亲自帮助他们扑灭。她先后五次被评为市、区爱国卫生模范。
    坚持工余打鼠
    贵州省除“四害”模范、打鼠能手于校章，是贵阳市第三中学的工人。他每天清早做完校内工作后，用一小时左右的时间去收回头一天安放的打鼠板，细心地进行洗刷，去掉板上的腥味；午后下班时，先把打鼠板安放到附近的食品加工店和其他老鼠经常出没的地方，然后才回家吃晚饭。他先后共买了一百一十个打鼠板，现在经常使用的有四十多个。他从开始打鼠以来，效果最好的一天曾打到四十八只，有一次一个板就打死了五只老鼠。平时，一般情况下每天也打到二十多只。从前年4月到现在，他已打死老鼠一万零二百多只。
    于校章除自己积极打鼠外，还把自己的打鼠经验介绍给别人，帮助别人提高打鼠技术。目前，他正和所在街道的居民研究如何进一步搜索捕打，使那条街变成无鼠街。
    由于他捕鼠成绩优越，去年6月，先后被评为贵阳市和贵州省的除“四害”模范，并获得了奖章、奖状和奖金。
