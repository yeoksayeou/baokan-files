Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th. Xinhua reporter Guo Jia reports: At the four-day 1958 National Spring Track and Field Meet, young Chinese track and field athletes achieved new accomplishments: thirteen athletes broke eleven national records. The only pre-Liberation national record that had not been broken, the men's 100-meter record of 10.7 seconds, was also threatened. Liang Jianxun, a short-distance runner from the People's Liberation Army, achieved a time of 10.8 seconds in the competition.

Even more gratifying is the emergence of more new talents in the games. Su Wenren, a 22-year-old railway worker from Kunming, surpassed veteran long-distance runners Wan Lübo and Fu Shenghai in the men's 5,000-meter final, finishing second only to the champion Huang Zhiyong. Dong Shucai, a 21-year-old from Xi'an, took second place in the women's 800-meter final with a time of 2 minutes 20.7 seconds. It is worth noting that 157 athletes participated in the 100-meter race, making it the event with the highest participation rate among all 40 events in the games, and more athletes achieved results of around 11 seconds. Many sports experts believe that although they did not break the national record of 10.7 seconds, the existence of such a strong track and field team makes breaking this national record in the future very optimistic.

The athletes broke eleven national records after passing through the winter and not yet reaching their best competitive condition, which was not common in previous years. Many people in the sports community believe that this is a good start to the great leap forward in China's track and field movement.

    田径运动选手的新成就
    新华社广州25日电新华社记者郭家报道：在为时四天的1958年全国春季田径运动会上，年轻的我国田径选手又取得了新的成就：有十三名运动员刷新了十一项全国纪录。全国唯一没有被打破的解放前的男子一百公尺十秒七的全国纪录，也受到了威胁。解放军短跑选手梁建勋在比赛中创造了十秒八的成绩。
    更可喜的是，在运动会中又涌现出了更多的新手。昆明市二十二岁的铁路工人苏文仁在男子五千公尺决赛中，超过长跑老将万吕柏和傅生海，仅次于冠军黄志勇而获得第二名。西安市二十一岁的董淑才在女子八百公尺决赛中，以二分二十秒七的成绩获得了第二名。在男子一百公尺决赛中，广州市二十二岁的大学生李元新以十一秒二的成绩获得第五名。值得注意的是参加这次一百公尺比赛的运动员有一百五十七人，是这次运动会全部四十项比赛中参加人数最多的一个，而且有更多选手的成绩达到十一秒左右。许多体育专家认为，虽然他们没有打破十秒七的全国纪录，但是有这样一支壮大的田径队伍，打破这项全国纪录的前途是非常乐观的。
    运动员们在渡过了冬季，还没有达到最良好的竞技状态就打破了十一项全国纪录，这是往年所不常有的。许多体育界人士认为，这是我国田径运动大跃进的良好开端。
