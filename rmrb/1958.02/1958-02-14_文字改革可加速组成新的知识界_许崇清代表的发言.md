I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Director Wu Yuzhang, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

This year, we have victoriously entered the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. With the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, a magnificent and surging high tide of great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production has emerged nationwide. The National Economic Plan for 1958 and the budget for 1958, proposed by the State Council, adapt to the new revolutionary situation and plan new battle tasks for 1958 in the economic and cultural education fields. The combination of the state plan and the conscious practice of the masses, the overall coordination of all units, and the concerted efforts of all departments ensure the overfulfillment of tasks.

Transform old intellectuals, cultivate new worker-peasant intellectuals, and form a new intellectual class.

In the National Economic Plan for 1958, in the cultural education aspect, some measures for developing worker-peasant education propose a new task regarding intellectuals. Transforming old intellectuals and cultivating new worker-peasant intellectuals are two different tasks before us, differing in scale and process. Naturally, the approaches must also be different.

I would now like to share some of my personal opinions on language reform and the new tasks regarding intellectuals.

We inherited a limited number of scientific and technological cadres from the old society. The composition and scale of the previous intellectual class were small. It was only suitable for a semi-feudal and semi-colonial, backward agricultural country's level and could not meet the growing needs of a country rapidly advancing along the path of socialist industrialization.

During the First Five-Year Plan, although we cultivated a large number of cadres and greatly expanded our scientific and technological ranks, in terms of its social composition, it was still not much different from the composition of the previous intellectual class. Among them, the working class, peasants, and other laboring classes from democratic lower strata still accounted for a very small number.

After the elimination of class antagonism, the new class components of society have not yet been adequately reflected in the intellectual class.

Although our policy on intellectuals, under the general victory of socialist construction, has attracted many old intellectuals to serve socialist construction and make great contributions, in the new stage of further and widespread development of socialist construction, the tasks concerning intellectuals are presented to us in a new way and take on new significance. Without cultivating and strengthening the people's new intellectual force, the working class's grand plan for the socialist transformation of the country cannot be realized. Therefore, cultivating socialist intellectuals who are closely connected with workers and peasants and forming a new intellectual class, especially a new scientific and technological intellectual class, has become a decisive condition for the development of the country and an important condition for further strengthening and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

Since we established the people's democratic dictatorship, we have long eliminated the obstacles placed by the bourgeoisie and landlords on the education of workers and peasants. Education has become something accessible to the broad masses of workers and peasants. Universities and colleges have also opened their doors to workers and peasants. Practical workers have obtained the practical possibility of enriching their theoretical knowledge. During the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, we established the socialist economic system. Moreover, we have carried out tremendous organizational and ideological consolidation of this new economy and achieved new successes. Our socialist position is being strengthened and consolidated. We have embarked on a new stage of development. On the basis of our victory in the First Five-Year Plan and the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, a more magnificent upsurge of socialist construction has emerged. All the people have been invigorated, and the demand for culture is increasingly urgent. We now have the possibility to implement planned cultivation of cultural forces and to solve the task of forming a new intellectual class as a major national task.

In the past, the intellectual class was largely formed and developed spontaneously. In our present society, its formation and development can be guided in a planned way. This is a unique and extremely advantageous method different from that used by the ruling class in the past. We now have the possibility of launching a nationwide cultural upsurge of the entire people and solving the task of forming a new intellectual class on this basis. The cultural and spiritual upsurge of hundreds of millions of people will create a broad foundation for the constant replenishment and expansion of the intellectual force. The cultural revolution is manifested in this strong upsurge in the cultural level of the entire people. And the result of the cultural revolution is the birth of a new people's socialist intellectual class. The social composition and political outlook of this intellectual class, born in this way, can be different from the old intellectual class.

Several million young people from the working class, peasants, and other laboring classes must be educated in universities, secondary technical schools, and various cultural centers, as well as in factories, mines, farms, and agricultural cooperatives, and be added to the intellectual force to change the face of the intellectual class in their own image and likeness, so that members of the old intellectual class can be dissolved into the new people's intellectual class.

Since this intellectual class is born among the people, its formation means that the people have obtained the real possibility of fully exerting their creativity. And this marks a new upsurge of genuine people's democracy.

The phonetic alphabet plan has penetrated the lives of the people and become something that the people are accustomed to, so the cultural revolution has obtained the fundamental guarantee of final victory.

Looking at the task of language reform in relation to the current very urgent task of forming a new intellectual class, its significance and role are even greater. In particular, the phonetic alphabet plan in the reform plan is the most fundamental component of the entire plan. It can be compared to the launch system program of an artificial satellite. It has the same importance and similar value as the satellite launch system program. Only with the correct design of the launch system can the artificial satellite fly into the sky. Only with the correct Chinese phonetic alphabet design in language reform can it adapt to the needs of the situation, enable Chinese characters, which have long been divorced from the people, to be returned to the people as soon as possible, so that they can be mastered and used by the people, and give full play to their inherent role. The phonetic alphabet plan has penetrated the lives of the people and become something that the people are accustomed to, so the cultural revolution has obtained the fundamental guarantee of final victory.

Chinese characters were not invented by one person, as the legend in our history says. It is the result of the hard work of countless people. It was formulated to meet the needs of the entire national society, a unified, common means of exchanging ideas and accumulating knowledge that all members of society should know. Later, in a long process, it became the monopoly of a small number of people in the ruling class, which changed its original nature of being universally used by the masses. Some simplified characters specially created by the people for social struggle and development were regarded as "wrong characters" and "vulgar characters" and were discriminated against. Difficult to read, difficult to write, and difficult to remember have become the characteristics of Chinese characters. In addition, due to the influence of dialects, the pronunciation of a character varies from region to region. When pronounced, people do not understand each other. If a phonetic alphabet is not set as a unified standard, even if it can be spelled and annotated, it will not be widely used and its use will be small.

Our country has achieved unprecedented unity in politics, economy, and culture. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country are united and working hard for the common goal of building socialism. The people need a common language, a language for the whole people, to coordinate everyone's joint activities. To meet this need, the only way is to improve and expand the existing Northern dialect, which has the largest population of users. This is the new way of Chinese development determined by the development of our entire social life.

Simplified characters have been developing in Chinese characters since ancient times. This is the inevitable result of social struggle and development. In the future, due to the establishment of a socialist country, the increase in socialist production, the emergence of socialist culture, and the development of technology and science, a large number of new words and new phrases will appear, a large number of old words will disappear from the vocabulary, and the meanings of a large number of words will change. Inevitably, a large number of old characters will be discarded, and a large number of new characters will be created. Since these characters are created by the working people, they will naturally not be traditional characters but only simplified characters. The number of simplified characters will gradually increase. The number of traditional characters will gradually decrease. The final result will be that all traditional characters will be replaced by simplified characters.

In a certain stage of future development of Chinese characters, there may be some confusion. But we should understand that since the emergence of writing, the records of various knowledge and observations have also been chaotic and even contradictory. Later, after sorting and initially systematizing them, the gradually accumulated knowledge can identify the connections between various phenomena, their interdependence, and their regularity. In this way, the initial sprouts of science were produced. Without repeated sorting and public guidance, Chinese characters themselves would not have achieved such unity today. Our current simplified characters are just collected, sorted, and promoted from the creations of the masses. The role of conscious leadership is increasing. Even if there are some details in the design of the phonetic alphabet that are not carefully considered, it will certainly be possible to continue to improve it in practice, in the mastery and use of the people.

The language reform movement is a revolutionary movement in the development of Chinese characters and also a revolutionary movement in the development of the Chinese language.

The language reform movement is currently a revolutionary movement in the development of Chinese characters and also a revolutionary movement in the development of the Chinese language. This revolution is not carried out through sudden outbursts. It is a long process. But considering the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and all laboring people under the new socialist relations and the urgent demand of the masses to generally acquire knowledge, science, and culture on the basis of political and economic changes, once this revolution is launched, the arrival of victory will be faster than people initially expected. If we can fully grasp and utilize all possible existing conditions to promote its development, the victory of this revolution will not only come unexpectedly quickly, but the fruits of victory will be even greater. Especially among the vast cooperative farmers, they need to acquire knowledge, science, and culture, and they need a cultural revolution to promote the complete cooperation of the economy. Gearing up, striving for the top, in the language reform movement, our peasant brothers are very likely to have a great leap forward and achieve amazing great victories.

But after all, writing is only a tool for cultural development. The revolution in writing and the cultural revolution cannot be confused. "If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." Once the tools are improved, the work can certainly be done well. After the Chinese phonetic alphabet plan is approved, it can be used to expand and strengthen worker-peasant cultural education activities. From then on, all the people can speed up their pace, promote the cultural upsurge, set off the heroic spirit of the cultural revolution, and push the giant wheel of the march towards nature, wave after wave, from victory to victory.

    文字改革可加速组成新的知识界
    许崇清代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任和彭真副委员长的报告。
    今年，我们已胜利地进入了第二个五年计划的第一年。随着反右派斗争、政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，在全国范围出现了波涛壮阔、气势汹涌的工农业生产大跃进的高潮。国务院所提出的一九五八年度的国民经济计划和一九五八年度的预算，适应着当前的革命的新形势，规划了一九五八年度的经济上和文化教育上的新战斗任务。国家计划和人民大众的自觉的实践结合起来，所有的单位形成总的配合，各个部门协调一致，超额完成任务，是有保证的。
    改造旧的知识分子，造就新的工农知识分子，组成新的知识界。
    一九五八年度的国民经济计划中，在文化教育方面，对发展工农教育的一些措施，提出了关于知识分子的一个新的任务。改造旧知识分子和造就新的工农知识分子是摆在我们面前的两个不同的任务，不论在规模上和在进程上都不相同。当然做法也要有分别。
    我现在就文字改革和关于知识分子的新任务谈一些我个人的意见。
    我们从旧社会继承下来的科学技术干部为数无多。已往的知识界的组成规模不大。它仅适合于半封建半殖民地的、落后的农业国的水平，当然不能满足沿着社会主义工业化道路迅速迈进的国家日益增长的需要。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们虽然培养了一大批干部，大大地扩大了我们的科学技术队伍，但就它的社会成份来说，仍与从前的知识界的组成内容相差无几。在他们中间，工人阶级、农民和其他劳动者阶层出身的民主下层仍占极少数。
    阶级对立被消灭后，社会的新的阶级成份在知识界中还未得到适当的反映。
    我们的知识分子政策，在社会主义建设一般的胜利的条件下，虽已吸引了许多旧知识分子服务于社会主义建设，并作出了巨大的贡献。但在社会主义建设进一步广泛展开的新阶段，关于知识分子的任务，就以新的方式摆到我们面前，而取得新的意义。不造就和壮大人民的新的知识分子队伍，就不能实现工人阶级的规模宏远的社会主义国家改造的计划。因此，造就与工农骨肉相连的社会主义知识分子，组成新的知识界，特别是组成新的科学技术知识界，就成为国家发展的一个决定条件，而且是进一步加强和巩固人民民主专政的一个重要条件。
    我们建立了人民民主专政以来，早就已铲除了资产阶级、地主给工人、农民布置下的受教育的障碍。教育已成为广大的工农群众所能得到的东西。高等学校也向工农敞开了大门。实际工作者已得到了充实自己的理论知识的实际可能。在发展国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，我们确立了社会主义经济制度。而且对于这种新的经济又在组织上和思想上进行了巨大的巩固工作，获得了新的成就。我们的社会主义阵地正在加强和巩固。我们已走上了一个新的发展阶段。在我们已取得了第一个五年计划的胜利，并取得了全民整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利的基础上，出现了一个形势更加壮阔的社会主义建设高潮。全体人民都已振奋起来，对文化的要求益感迫切。我们已有可能实行有计划地培养文化力量，把组成新知识界的任务作为全国性的重大任务提出来加以解决。
    从前，知识界在很大的程度上是自发地组成和发展起来的。在我们现在的社会里，它的组成和发展已有可能有计划地来引导了。这是我们特有的不同于已往的统治阶级所用的一种极其有利的方法。我们已有可能实行全国规模地掀起全体人民的文化高涨，并在这个基础上来解决组成新知识界这个任务。千百万人民大众的文化高涨和精神高涨将为知识分子队伍的经常不断地补充和壮大创造广大的基础。文化革命就表现在全体人民的文化水平的这一有力的高涨上。而文化革命的结果，就是新的人民的社会主义知识界的诞生。这样地诞生出来的知识界，它的社会成份、它的政治面貌才能有别于旧的知识界。
    必须有几百万由工人、农民和其他劳动者阶层出身的青年，在高等学校、中等技术学校以及各种各样的文化策源地，而且还在工厂里、矿山里、农场里和农业合作社里受到教育，补充到知识分子队伍中去，按照他们自己的形象和模样来改变知识界的面貌，旧的知识界的成员才能溶解在新的人民的知识界中。
    这个知识界，由于它是诞生在人民中间的，它的形成，就意味着人民得到了尽量发挥自己的创造力的真正可能。而这又标志着作为真正人民的民主主义的新的高涨。
    拼音方案深入了人民的生活，成为人民习惯的东西，文化革命就获得最后胜利的根本保证。
    关联到新知识界的组成这个当前十分迫切的任务来看文字改革的任务，它的意义和作用就更加增长了。特别是改革方案中的拼音方案，是改革的整个方案的最根本的一个组成部分。它可以譬于人造卫星的发射系统方案。它与卫星发射系统方案具有同样的重要性和同类的价值。人造卫星有了正确的发射系统的设计，才能飞上天。文字改革有了正确的汉字拼音设计，才能适应情势的需要，使久已脱离了人民的汉字，尽快地归还到人民手里，为人民所掌握和使用，而尽量地发挥它所固有的作用。拼音方案深入了人民的生活，成为了人民习惯的东西，文化革命就获得了最后胜利的根本保证。
    汉字并不是某一个人的发明，如在我们的历史上所传说的那样。它是经过无数人们的辛勤努力而产生的结果。它是为了满足整个民族社会的需要而制订出来的统一的、共同的、社会全体成员都应该认得的交流思想的手段和积累知识的工具。后来，在长时期的过程中，成为了统治阶级的一小部分人的垄断物，就改变了它原来的大众通用的性质。人民为了社会的斗争和发展而特自创造出来的一些简体字则被认为“别字”、“俗字”，而受到视歧。难读、难写、难记更成了汉字的特征。加以方言的影响，一个字，因地区的不同而读音也有差别。读出来，彼此都不懂得。如果不定出一种语音作为统一的标准，即使能拼音、注音，通行不广，用处就不大。
    我们的国家，在政治、经济和文化上，实现了空前的统一，全国人民在党和政府的领导下团结一致，为建设社会主义这个共同目标而奋斗，人民正需要一种共同的语言，全民的语言，以调整大家共同的活动。要满足这个需要，惟有通过改进和扩大现存的使用人口最多的北方话的途径。这是我们当前整个社会生活的发展所决定的汉语发展的新途径。
    汉字从古以来就有简体字的发展。这是社会的斗争和发展的必然的结果。今后，由于社会主义国家的确立、社会主义生产的增进和社会主义文化的产生以及技术和科学的发展，大批的新词、新语将会出现，大批的旧词将会从词汇中消失，大批的词的意义将会改变，必然也就会有大批的旧字被废弃，大批的新字被创造出来。这些字既是出自劳动人民所创造，自然就不会是繁体而只是简体。简体字就会逐渐加多。繁体字就会逐渐减少。繁体字结局就会全部为简体字所代替。
    汉字在今后发展的一定的阶段，可能会发生一些混乱。但我们应该理解，自从文字产生后，各种知识和观察结果的记载也是杂乱无章，甚至互相矛盾的。以后经过整理而粗具系统，逐渐积累起来的知识，就可以辨明各个现象间的联系，相互依赖的关系及其规律性。这样，就产生了科学的最初的萌芽。汉字本身不经过更番的整理和大众的引导，也不会得到今天这样的统一。我们现行的简体字，也不过是搜集、整理人民大众的创造而推广出去的。自觉的领导的作用正增长着，就是拼音方案，即使在设计中还有一些细节考究得不大周到的，也一定能够在实践中、在人民的掌握和使用中继续求得完善。
    文字改革运动是汉字发展中的一个革命运动，同时也是汉语发展中的一个革命运动。
    文字改革运动在当前是汉字发展中的一个革命运动，同时也是汉语发展中的一个革命运动。这个革命不是通过突然爆发的方式来进行的。它是一个长期的过程。但估计到当前工人、农民以及全体劳动人民在新的社会主义关系下的革命积极性和在政治、经济的变革的基础上人民大众普遍的获得知识、科学和文化的迫切要求，这个革命一经发动，胜利的到来将会比人们当初所预料的还要快。如果我们能够充分地掌握和利用现存的一切可能的条件来促进它的发展，这个革命的胜利不但会来得出乎意外的快，胜利的战果还会更大。特别是在广大的合作化的农民中间，他们需要获得知识、科学和文化，需要文化上的革命来促成经济的完全合作化。鼓起干劲，力争上游，在文字改革运动中，我们的农民弟兄很有可能也来一个大跃进，而取得惊人的大胜利的。
    但文字毕竟不过是文化发展的工具，文字上的革命与文化革命不能混淆。“工欲善其事必先利其器”。工具既经改进，工作就一定可以做好，汉语拼音方案，经批准后就可以利用它来扩大和加强工农文化教育活动，全体人民从此就可以加快步伐，促进文化高潮，掀起文化革命的雄风，推动向自然进军的巨轮，一浪赶一浪地由胜利走向胜利。
