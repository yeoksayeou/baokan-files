Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Economic Commission Bo Yibo stated at the National People's Congress this afternoon, demanding that the people of the country “strive for a new leap forward in the development of the national economy in 1958, to create a good beginning for the Second Five-Year Plan.”
The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress continued this afternoon at 3 p.m. The meeting listened to "The Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1958" given by Bo Yibo on behalf of the State Council, and "The Report on the Current Work on Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" given by Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee on behalf of the Chinese Language Reform Committee.
In his report, Bo Yibo discussed five issues: (1) The victory on the economic front in 1957; (2) Striving for a new leap forward in the national economy in 1958; (3) Arrangement of the development plans for various sectors of the national economy in 1958; (4) Practicing strict economy and opposing waste; (5) Fully relying on and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to complete and over fulfill the national economic plan for 1958.
　　Main indicators of the 1958 Plan:
　　Investment in capital construction to increase by 17.8%
　　Gross industrial output value to increase by 14.6%
　　Gross agricultural and sideline output value to increase by 6.1%
In his report, Bo Yibo elaborated on the most important indicators of the 1958 annual plan for capital construction and industrial and agricultural production, and the arrangement of the development plans for various sectors of the national economy in 1958. He said that the speed and scale of China's capital construction in 1958 will be greater than in any previous year. According to the main tasks of developing the national economy in 1958, in the allocation of investment, investment in the agricultural sector, especially water conservancy construction, has been increased, and investment in heavy industry, especially fuel, electricity, metallurgy, chemical industry, and other industries serving agriculture, has been increased. At the same time, investment in local construction has also been increased to promote greater development of local industries oriented towards and serving the countryside. The total investment in capital construction this year is planned to be 14.577 billion yuan, an increase of 2.2 billion yuan, or 17.8%, over the estimated figure for 1957. This year, a total of 1,185 projects above the limit will continue to be constructed and begin construction, of which 716 are industrial construction projects and 185 are agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy construction projects. Among these industrial construction projects, 188 can be completed this year. In terms of industrial production, the planned gross industrial output value for 1958 is 64.37 billion yuan, an increase of 14.6% over 1957. According to the new situation of the high tide of agricultural production, the total output value of agriculture and agricultural and sideline production in 1958 is planned to be 68.83 billion yuan, an increase of 6.1% over 1957. This speed greatly exceeds the average speed of China's First Five-Year Plan. In terms of output, grain in 1958 will reach 392 billion jin, an increase of 22 billion jin over the previous year, an increase of 5.9%, and cotton will reach 35 million dan, an increase of 2.2 million dan over the previous year, an increase of 6.7%.
In the conclusion of his report, Bo Yibo said that our economic workers "must become promoters of socialist construction, not obstructors, nor status quo maintainers." He called for eliminating bureaucratic airs, bureaucraticism, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and fully relying on and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to strive to complete and over fulfill the national economic plan for 1958.
After Bo Yibo concluded his report, Wu Yuzhang then delivered "The Report on the Current Work on Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme."
Wu Yuzhang said that the current task of language reform in our country, as far as the Han nationality is concerned, is: (1) to simplify Chinese characters so that they can be more easily mastered and used by the broad masses of people, in order to eliminate illiteracy, popularize and improve culture more, better, faster and more economically among the broad masses of people; (2) to promote Mandarin Chinese in order to eliminate dialect barriers and promote the further unification of the Chinese language so that our language can better serve China's socialist construction; (3) to formulate and implement the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme to annotate Chinese characters and help promote Mandarin Chinese.
Wu Yuzhang pointed out that the work of language reform in our country in recent years has been carried out in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines. He then gave a detailed explanation of the important significance of promoting simplified Chinese characters and popularizing Mandarin Chinese, and the achievements made in recent years. When talking about the issue of formulating and implementing the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, he emphasized that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is not a Chinese phonetic writing system. The main purpose of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to annotate Chinese characters and spell Mandarin Chinese to help literacy, unify pronunciation, and teach Mandarin Chinese, with the aim of facilitating the learning and use of Chinese characters by the broad masses of people and promoting the further unification of the Chinese language.
Wu Yuzhang said that the "Draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" submitted to this conference for discussion and approval has undergone long-term research by experts, repeated discussions by people from all walks of life in the country, and multiple revisions. It truly reflects the opinions of the majority of people participating in the discussion and is more appropriate than previous schemes. Therefore, he hopes that this conference will approve the scheme after discussion, and hopes that it will be vigorously promoted step by step throughout the country.
The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Lin Boqu, Zhang Wentian, Zhang Zhizhong, Hua Luogeng, Ye Shengtao, Deng Baoshan, Kui Bi, Yang Zhihua, Li Shunda, and Hu Ziang.
Today's meeting ended at 6:20 p.m. In the morning, the representatives held group meetings separately.
The conference will continue tomorrow.

　　吴玉章报告当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案
    据新华社3日讯　国务院副总理兼国家经济委员会主任薄一波今天下午在全国人民代表大会会议上，要求全国人民“努力争取1958年的国民经济发展有一个新的跃进，为第二个五年计划创造一个好的开端”。
    第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议今天下午三时继续举行。会议分别听取了薄一波代表国务院所作的“关于1958年度国民经济计划草案的报告”，和中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章代表中国文字改革委员会所作的“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。
    薄一波在报告中谈到五个问题：（一）1957年经济战线上的胜利；（二）争取1958年国民经济的新跃进；（三）1958年国民经济各部门发展计划的安排；（四）厉行节约，反对浪费；（五）充分依靠和发挥群众的积极性和创造性，完成和超额完成1958年度的国民经济计划。
　　1958年计划主要指标：
　　基本建设投资增长17.8％
　　工业生产总值增长14.6％
　　农副业总产值增长6.1％
    薄一波在报告中就1958年度基本建设和工农业生产计划的最主要的指标、1958年国民经济各部门发展计划的安排等，作了说明。他说，1958年我国的基本建设的速度和规模，将比以往任何一年都要大得多。按照1958年发展国民经济的主要任务，在投资的分配上，增加了农业部门特别是水利建设部门的投资，增加了重工业部门特别是燃料、电力、冶金、化工和其他为农业服务的工业部门的投资。同时，也增加了地方的建设投资，以促进面向农村，为农村服务的地方工业的更大发展。今年基本建设投资总额拟定为一百四十五亿七千七百万元，比1957年的预计数增加了二十二亿元，增长17.8％。今年计划继续施工和开始施工的限额以上的建设项目共有一千一百八十五个，其中工业建设项目是七百一十六个，农林水利建设项目是一百八十五个。这些工业建设项目，在今年内可以建设完工的有一百八十八个。在工业生产方面，1958年工业总产值计划，拟定为六百四十三亿七千万元，比1957年增长14.6％。根据农业生产高潮的新形势，1958年农业和农副业的总产值，拟定为六百八十八亿三千万元，比1957年增长6.1％。这个速度，大大地超过了我国第一个五年计划的平均速度。以产量计算，1958年粮食将达到三千九百二十亿斤，比上一年增加二百二十亿斤，增长5.9％，棉花将达到三千五百万担，比上一年增加二百二十万担，增长6.7％。
    薄一波在报告的最后说，我们的经济工作人员“要成为社会主义建设的促进派，不要成为促退派，也不要成为现状维持派”。他要求打掉官气，打掉官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，充分地依靠和发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，为完成和超额完成1958年度的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    薄一波报告结束以后，吴玉章接着作“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。
    吴玉章说，当前我国文字改革的任务，在汉民族说来，就是：（1）简化汉字，使它更容易为广大人民掌握和使用，以便在广大人民中更多、更好、更快、更省地扫除文盲，普及和提高文化；（2）推广普通话，以消除方言的隔阂，促进汉语的进一步统一，使我们的语言能够更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务；（3）制定和推行汉语拼音方案，为汉字注音和帮助推广普通话。
    吴玉章指出，我国几年来的文字改革工作就是遵照上述方针来进行的。他接着就简化汉字的推行和推广普通话的重要意义和几年来所取得的成就，作了详细的说明。他在谈到制定和推行汉语拼音方案的问题时着重指出，汉语拼音方案不是汉语拼音文字。汉语拼音方案的主要用途是给汉字注音和拼写普通话，以帮助识字、统一读音和教学普通话，目的在于便利广大人民的学习和使用汉字，以及促进汉语的进一步统一。
    吴玉章说，提交这次大会讨论和批准的“汉语拼音方案草案”，曾经经过专家们的长期研究、全国各方面人士的反复讨论和多次修订，它确实反映了参加讨论的大多数人的意见，比以往各种方案更为妥善。因此，他希望这次大会经过讨论之后把这个方案予以批准，并且希望在全国范围逐步地大力推行。
    今天大会的执行主席是：林伯渠、张闻天、张治中、华罗庚、叶圣陶、邓宝珊、奎璧、杨之华、李顺达、胡子昂。
    今天的大会在下午六时二十分结束。上午各代表小组分组举行了会议。
    明天大会将继续进行。
