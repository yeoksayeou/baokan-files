Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 2nd. Gansu Province has mobilized the masses this year to build various small fertilizer plants (sites) using local materials.

According to incomplete statistics, more than two thousand small granular fertilizer sites, bacterial fertilizer sites, bone fertilizer plants, and blood fertilizer plants have been built or are under construction. The vast majority of townships have a small fertilizer plant (site). Some have even reached the point where every agricultural cooperative has a fertilizer plant. Lintao County has a total of 358 agricultural cooperatives. Since December of last year, the county has started building 358 granular fertilizer sites and one bacterial fertilizer plant. These plants have simple equipment, cost little money, and are built quickly. Generally, old houses are used, and equipment such as sieves, large pots, and steamers are purchased, and they can be built in one or two months. The plants that have been built or are under construction will produce some fertilizer before the spring planting. The 104 granular fertilizer sites built in Wuwei County can produce more than 11 million jin before the spring planting. The bacterial fertilizer plant built in Zhangye Prefecture will also produce fertilizer for seed mixing for more than 500,000 mu of land. According to last year's pilot results, these fertilizers generally have significant effects after application. Applying granular fertilizer can increase production by more than 7% per mu, bacterial fertilizer can increase production by 5% to 10% per mu, with some places increasing by 30%, and blood fertilizer can also increase production by more than 10%.

In addition, Gansu Province will also build three new and expand two medium-sized fertilizer plants this year to produce mud fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, bone fertilizer, and bacterial fertilizer. These plants will be put into production within the year. A large, modern nitrogen fertilizer plant is also being built in Lanzhou at an accelerated pace and will be basically completed in the fourth quarter of this year.

Gansu Province originally had very few fertilizer plants, with only two medium-sized fertilizer plants and ten small fertilizer sites built by counties and cities, which were far from meeting the needs. However, Gansu has abundant fertilizer resources, which are suitable for the large-scale development of the fertilizer industry. For example, peat (turf) is found almost everywhere in southern Gansu, northern Gansu, and the Hexi Corridor. Bones and blood of livestock are also abundant in Hexi and Gannan.

### 甘肃建设二千多个肥料厂

　　甘肃建设二千多个肥料厂
    新华社兰州2日电　甘肃省今年发动群众就地取材建设多种小型肥料厂（场）。
    据不完全统计，目前已经建成和正在建设的小型颗粒肥料场、细菌肥料场、骨肥厂和血肥厂等已超过两千个。绝大部分的乡都有一个小型肥料厂（场）。有的已经达到社社有肥料厂。临洮县共三百五十八个农业社。从去年12月这个县就动手建设了三百五十八个颗粒肥料场和一个细菌肥料厂。这些厂设备简单、花钱少、建设时间快。一般是利用旧房屋，买些筛子、大锅和蒸笼等设备，有一、二个月就能建成。现在已经建成和正在建设的厂都将在春播前生产部分肥料。武威县建起的一百零四个颗粒肥料场，春播前可以生产出一千一百多万斤。张掖专区建设的一座细菌肥料厂也将生产可供五十万亩以上土地拌种用肥。根据去年试点结果，这些肥料施用后一般效果都比较显著，施用颗粒肥料每亩地可增产7％以上，细菌肥料每亩可增产5％到10％；有的地方增到30％，血肥也可增产10％以上。
    此外，甘肃省今年还要新建三个、扩建两个中型肥料厂，生产泥肥、磷肥、骨肥和细菌肥料。这些厂年内即可投入生产。还有一座大型的现代化的氮肥厂正在兰州加紧兴建，在今年第四季度也可基本建成。
    甘肃省原来肥料厂很少，只有两个中型的肥料厂和县市建设的十个小型肥料场，远远不能满足需要。但是，甘肃地区的肥料资源很丰富，适宜大量发展肥料工业。如在甘肃南部、北部以及河西一带差不多到处都有草炭（泥煤）。河西和甘南牲畜的骨、血也很多。
