　　What Exactly Is Participating in the Revolution For?
　　Lin Hong
    The exemplary deeds of Comrade Fang Homing, a former Red Army regimental commander who retired to become a farmer and has diligently and frugally built his hometown over the past eight years, are highly educational for each of us, especially for young people who have recently joined the revolution. This fact leads us to deeply consider what exactly a person participates in the revolution for: is it to create a happy life for the people and build our country into a prosperous and strong nation? Or is it for personal gain, only knowing how to pursue personal fame, status, and material enjoyment?
    Communist Party members have the lofty ideals of communism and the great spirit of dedicating themselves to the cause of communism. The purpose of their lives in this world is to completely eradicate all unreasonable phenomena in the world, to fundamentally transform human society, and to fully develop the productive forces, thereby enabling everyone to live a prosperous, happy, and civilized life. Therefore, they have no personal selfish thoughts, but are constantly inspired by this lofty ideal; in order to realize this lofty ideal, they can endure all kinds of hardships and even sacrifice their personal lives. It is precisely because they possess this finest and most noble quality of mankind that they can strictly subordinate personal interests to the interests of the collective and the state, resolutely obey the needs of the work, and always excellently complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party, using their exemplary actions to influence and educate the masses, and rapidly advance the cause of revolution and construction.
    Fang Homing, a former Red Army regimental commander, is a person with this finest and most noble quality. As early as 1929, when the sky over our country was still full of dark clouds, he devoted himself to the magnificent cause of communism and threw himself into the storm of revolution. In more than twenty years, he withstood the test of the arduous revolutionary struggle, participated in the 25,000-li Long March, climbed over snow-capped mountains and grasslands, ate tree bark and grass roots, fought hundreds of battles on the revolutionary battlefield, shed blood and made contributions for the cause of the Party and the people, and is worthy of being a heroic son and daughter of the people. However, what is particularly worthy of respect is that although Fang Homing has made such contributions to the Party and the people, as some people say, even if he has no merit, he has worked hard, and he himself has changed from an ordinary soldier to a Red Army regimental commander; however, he does not have any sense of self-importance or complacency towards the Party and the people, and he regards everything he has done as something that a Communist Party member should do. He said to people: "In the past, when there was a need to fight, I went to fight. Now that there is a need for labor and production, I will come back to farm." It is precisely this thought of wholeheartedly serving the Party, the people, and the revolution that made him so heroic and tenacious on the revolutionary battlefield in the past, and made him contribute to the people. It is also this thought of wholeheartedly serving the Party, the people, and the revolution that, after the national liberation in 1949, made him unwilling to retire for recuperation, "letting the Party and the state support him for nothing," but resolutely carrying a small roll of luggage and returning to his hometown to become a farmer.
    A Red Army regimental commander who went through the Long March returning to his hometown to become a farmer is something that many people cannot understand; but for Communists, there is nothing incomprehensible. Since Communist Party members are wholeheartedly serving the people, and since they understand that the purpose of the revolution is to enable everyone to be well-clothed, well-fed, and well-housed, when their health is not suitable for working in the army, not being a regimental commander but becoming a farmer, and building their hometown with their fellow villagers, is a very ordinary thing. First of all, he pays attention to the interests of the people and the collective everywhere. According to the contributions he has made to the people, he can get the necessary care; but he refuses such care because he is unwilling to increase the burden on the people, and he wants to support himself with his own hands, working as much as he can. Not only that, when his family suffered misfortune and encountered difficulties in life, he did not reach out to the government for relief, but instead bought public bonds with the money he earned from temporary work. After he relied on the hard work of himself and his family and had more than 200 yuan of cash income last year, he did not use this money to improve his life, but first took out more than 100 yuan to repay the loan, because he believed that the country needed money for construction, and it didn't matter if personal life was a little tighter and harder. Secondly, Fang Homing often said to people: "When suffering hardships, look forward and look at the long-term; when enjoying happiness, look backward and don't forget your roots." It is precisely this heroic revolutionary optimism and firm revolutionary will that have enabled Fang Homing to overcome various difficulties in production and life in the past eight years, and under his active labor, agricultural cooperation has been realized in the whole township, greatly improving productivity and improving the lives of poor peasant brothers.
    In our Party and revolutionary ranks, there are many people like Fang Homing. They are the backbone of the Party and the pillars of the country, and are staunch fighters for building socialism and communism. But it should also be seen that there are still many people, especially many young people, who lack this firm revolutionary stand and lack the ideological qualities and work style of wholeheartedly serving the Party, the people, and the revolution. They also say in words that they are willing to serve the people wholeheartedly, but their subjective wishes cannot withstand the test of objective reality; when personal interests and collective interests conflict, they always think too much about personal interests and too little about collective interests, and even think only of themselves, without any collective concept or national concept at all. They are not like Comrade Fang Homing, who can be both an official and a civilian, but can only be an official and cannot be a civilian; can only work in big cities and cannot go to the countryside to work; can only live a life of enjoyment and cannot live a hard life. In short, they have not yet been dissolved by the revolution and have not completely given themselves to the Party and the people. This is the root of the problem. In order to be a staunch communist fighter, these comrades should be determined to transform themselves and completely change their bourgeois stand.
    Every one of our Party members and cadres should be encouraged by the exemplary deeds of Comrade Fang Homing, continue to move forward on the existing basis, and transform themselves into outstanding revolutionary fighters who take hardship first and enjoyment later, put the country first and the individual second, and can be both officials and civilians.

### 参加革命究竟为了什么

　　参加革命究竟为了什么
　　林洪
    红军老团长方和明同志解甲当农民，在过去的八年中克勤克俭地建设家乡的模范事迹，对于我们每一个人，特别是对于参加革命不久的青年人是很有教育意义的。这一事实引导我们深思的是一个人参加革命究竟为了什么：是为了替人民创造幸福的生活，把我们的国家建设成为一个繁荣富强的国家呢？还是为了自己的私利，只知道追逐个人的名誉地位和物质享受呢？
    共产党员具有共产主义的崇高理想，具有为共产主义事业而献身的伟大精神。他们生活在世界上的目的，就是为了彻底铲除人间的一切不合理的现象，为了从根本上改造人类社会，为了充分地发展生产力，从而使人人都过着富裕的、幸福的、文明的生活。因此，他们没有个人的私念，而是时刻为这个崇高的理想所鼓舞着；为了实现这个崇高的理想，他们可以忍受各种艰难困苦，甚至可以牺牲个人的生命。正是因为他们具有这种人类最优良、最高尚的品质，所以他们能够把个人的利益严格地服从于集体的和国家的利益，能够坚决地服从工作的需要，并且总是在工作中出色地完成党交给他们的任务，用自己的模范行动去影响和教育群众，把革命和建设的事业迅速地推向前进。
    红军老团长方和明，就是具有这种最优良、最高尚的品质的人。早在1929年，当我国的天空还满布着阴云的时候，他就献身于共产主义的壮丽事业，就投身于革命的暴风雨之中。在二十多年的时间内，他经受住了严酷的革命斗争的考验，参加了二万五千里长征，爬过雪山草地，吃过树皮草根，在革命的战场上身经百战，为党和人民的事业流过血，立过功，不愧为人民的英雄儿女。但是，特别值得人们崇敬的是，尽管方和明对党和对人民有过这样的贡献，正如一些人所说的没有功劳也有苦劳，并且他自己也由一个普通的士兵变为红军的团长；然而他对党和对人民没有任何居功自傲的思想，他把自己作过的一切都看作共产党员应该作的事情。他这样对人说：“过去需要打仗，我就去打仗。现在需要劳动生产，我就回来耕田。”正是这种一心为党、为人民和为革命的思想，使他在过去革命的战场上是那样地英勇顽强，为人民立下了功勋。也正是这种一心为党、为人民和为革命的思想，在1949年全国解放以后，使他不愿意去休养，“让党和国家白白养活自己”，而是毅然决然地背上一小卷行李，回到自己的家乡去当农民。
    一个经过长征的红军团长，回到自己的家乡当农民，这是许多人不能理解的；但是对于共产党人，就没有什么不可理解的地方。共产党员既然是全心全意地为人民服务，既然懂得革命的目的是为了使人人穿好、吃好、住好，而在自己身体不适宜在部队工作的时候，不当团长而去当农民，和乡亲们一起建设家乡，这是一件很平常的事情。首先，他处处注意到人民的利益，集体的利益，按照他对人民所作过的贡献，他可以得到必要的照顾；但是他拒绝了这样的照顾，因为他不愿意增加人民的负担，他要用自己的双手来养活自己，能劳动多少就劳动多少。不仅这样，在他的家庭发生不幸，生活遇到困难的时候，他也没有伸手向政府要救济，反而用打短工得来的钱买了公债。在他依靠自己和家人的辛勤劳动，去年有二百多元的现款收入以后，他又不是拿这笔钱来改善生活，而是首先拿出一百多元归还贷款，因为他认为国家建设正需要钱，个人的生活紧一点和苦一点没关系。其次方和明常对人说：“吃苦的时候要朝前看，看远景；享福的时候要朝后看，别忘本。”正是这种豪迈的革命乐观主义和坚定的革命意志，使方和明在八年中克服了生产和生活上的各种困难，而且在他的积极劳动之下，全乡实现了农业合作化，大大地提高了生产力，使穷苦的农民兄弟也改善了生活。
    在我们的党内和革命队伍中，有许多像方和明这样的人。他们是党的骨干和国家的栋梁，是建设社会主义和共产主义的坚定的战士。但是也应该看到，还有不少人特别是不少青年人，十分缺乏这种坚定的革命立场，十分缺乏一心为党、为人民和为革命的思想品质和工作作风。他们口头上也说是愿意全心全意地为人民服务，但是他们的主观愿望经不起客观实际的考验；一碰到个人利益和集体利益发生冲突的时候，他们总是过多地想到个人利益，过少地想集体利益，甚至一心为己，根本就没有集体观念和国家观念。他们不是像方和明同志那样，既能为官也能为民，而是只能为官不能为民；只能在大城市工作，不能到农村去工作；只能过享福的生活，不能过艰苦的生活。总之，他们还没有为革命所溶化，还没有把自己完全交给党和人民。这就是问题的根本所在。为要作一个坚定的共产主义的战士，这些同志就应该下决心改造自己，彻底转变自己的资产阶级立场。
    我们每个党员、干部，都应该从方和明同志的模范事迹中得到鼓舞，在已有的基础上继续前进，把自己改造成为吃苦在前享乐在后，国家第一，个人第二，既能为官也能为民的优秀的革命战士。
