Carry out the Cultural Revolution Quickly, Well, and Economically
Representative Wu Yifang Discusses the Work and Opinions on Language Reform in Jiangsu Province

I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the national budget for 1957 and the draft national budget for 1958, as well as Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the draft national economic plan for 1958. We firmly believe that, based on the victorious completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, and after the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people has been ignited, and their socialist construction initiative and creativity have soared to unprecedented heights. Coupled with the favorable international situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, 1958 will be a year of comprehensive great leap forward in China's socialist construction. We will definitely be able to complete and over-fulfill the national economic plan for 1958.

Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current language reform work and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme illustrates that language reform is a significant measure for socialist cultural construction. Because this work concerns the cultural traditions and cultural life of the entire nation, the Party and the government have adopted a policy of active and steady progress, which is entirely correct. Formulating and promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, simplifying Chinese characters, and popularizing Mandarin Chinese are the three specific tasks of the current language reform work. I enthusiastically support this Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme and suggest that the Congress approve it. Now, I will provide some brief information and opinions on the language reform work in Jiangsu Province over the past two years.

Following the Spirit of Prudence and Activity: Simplification of Chinese Characters Should Continue

Since the National Language Reform Conference in 1955, our province has conducted extensive publicity work in a planned manner. Over the past two years, we have compiled the booklet "Language Must Be Reformed Under Certain Conditions," published eleven types of language reform-related reading materials totaling 500,000 copies, and conducted publicity through newspapers, magazines, radio stations, as well as using pictures, slides, and report meetings. In the winter of 1955, the province and various cities and counties organized symposiums, inviting experts who studied linguistics, teachers from normal schools and primary and secondary schools, as well as democratic figures from all walks of life. After discussion, everyone believed that Chinese characters have their own development process and have made indelible contributions in Chinese history; however, learning Chinese characters is a difficult task. Feudal rulers and the leisured class hoped that the people would remain ignorant. They mastered the characters, but were indifferent to whether the characters met the needs of the broad masses. We are now building socialism, which requires all people to have culture. We should change the difficult-to-read, difficult-to-write, and difficult-to-remember situation of Chinese characters, making them easier for the broad masses to master and use. The conclusion of the symposium was that Chinese characters should be simplified to make them easier to write, and phonetic notation should be used with Latin letters to make them easier to read and remember, in order to meet the long-standing wishes of the broad masses. According to the statistics of more than 10,000 people who participated in the symposiums in various parts of our province, 90.6% supported simplifying Chinese characters, and 96.4% supported using phonetic letters to annotate Chinese characters.

Regarding the simplification of Chinese characters, since the State Council announced the table of simplified Chinese characters in January 1956, people from all walks of life in our province have warmly welcomed and actively adopted them. A primary school teacher in Nanjing said that the traditional Chinese characters in the lesson "National Day, Grand Meeting, Everyone Cheers Long Live Chairman Mao" originally had 98 strokes, but after simplification, there were only 39 strokes. This saves children a lot of time and energy when learning their mother tongue! Similarly, after the broad masses of working people gained liberation politically and economically, they urgently demanded a cultural liberation to meet their needs to participate in political, economic, and cultural activities. Their time is precious. They demand to recognize more characters in less time. Therefore, the problem now is that there are still too few simplified characters, and many commonly used characters with relatively complex strokes have not yet been simplified. Therefore, I fully support Director Wu Yuzhang's opinion that the simplification of Chinese characters should continue to be promoted in accordance with the spirit of prudence and activity.

Dialectal Differences Affect Daily Work: The Promotion of Mandarin Chinese Must Be Vigorously Carried Out

The dialects within Jiangsu are complex, and some dialects differ greatly from Mandarin Chinese, which causes many inconveniences in our daily work. Therefore, we deeply feel the great significance of promoting Mandarin Chinese. Taking the allocation of primary school teachers as an example, there is a surplus of primary school teachers in the Suzhou area of our province, but a shortage in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas. However, some normal school graduates who were assigned from southern Jiangsu to northern Jiangsu cannot settle down to work. This is certainly because they are not enthusiastic and responsible enough for the cause of people's education. But the fact that they cannot communicate in the local language, which causes many inconveniences in teaching and life, is also a practical problem. For example, in agricultural reform, we want to help farmers learn advanced production experiences. However, if farmers from Huaiyin go to Songjiang to learn how to grow rice, and farmers from Xuzhou go to Nantong to learn how to grow cotton, dialectal differences will bring many difficulties.

In order to promote Mandarin Chinese, our province trained lecturers and instructors for voice training classes in various places. We held four voice training classes in Nanjing with more than 700 primary and secondary school teachers participating. Then, voice training classes were held separately in various places. Now, 63% of primary school teachers, or more than 75,000, and 36% of secondary school teachers, or more than 6,000, in the province have learned Mandarin Chinese. About more than half of the primary and secondary school teachers can use Mandarin Chinese for teaching. Children in the lower grades of primary school can basically recite texts in Mandarin Chinese, and students in the middle and upper grades of primary school and in secondary schools and normal schools can mostly read texts aloud and answer questions in Mandarin Chinese in the classroom. At the same time as promoting Mandarin Chinese, in order to conduct dialect surveys and study the correspondence between the dialect phonology of various regions of our province and Beijing phonology, so that people in various dialect areas can more easily master Beijing phonology, we jointly invited relevant professors from six universities and some people from the community with Shanghai to hold a dialect survey meeting and established a dialect survey work guidance group. We have now compiled Mandarin Chinese learning manuals for Xuzhou, Pixian, and Wujiang, and Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Yangzhou, which have been submitted to the publishing house. We are currently compiling eight or nine learning manuals for Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Xinhailian. It is expected that all the Mandarin Chinese learning manuals for various parts of the province will be compiled before the summer vacation this year.

Since the Language Reform Committee published the first draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme in February 1956, many people in all walks of life in our province, especially primary and secondary school teachers, have learned the phonetic alphabet, and everyone hopes that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme can be finalized as soon as possible. Now, a high tide of comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is forming throughout the province, and the working people are becoming more and more eager to have a tool that facilitates the learning of Chinese characters, so as to rapidly improve their cultural level. It is not difficult to imagine that when this set of phonetic letters is fully promoted, whether it is eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, or learning in spare time and improving technology, the time will be greatly shortened. Therefore, I believe that this set of phonetic letters is a tool for learning culture and promoting Mandarin Chinese quickly, well, and economically in the high tide of economic construction, and is a powerful weapon to help the working people carry out the cultural revolution.

Leaders Should Attach Importance to Language Reform Work and Mobilize the Enthusiasm of the Masses

Over the past two years, under the correct leadership of the central government, our province has achieved certain results in language reform work, but it is far from enough. We have learned from our work practice that the primary key to doing this work well is the importance attached to it by the leadership. In 1956, because the province grasped this work relatively tightly, a high tide of learning Mandarin Chinese and the phonetic alphabet was formed in various places; in the second half of 1957, the province paid less attention to this work, and there was a slackening phenomenon in various places. Similar situations also exist in various cities and counties. In Xuzhou, the leadership grasped tightly in 1956, and almost all teachers taught in Mandarin Chinese; in 1957, the leadership relaxed, and the number of people who spoke Mandarin Chinese gradually decreased. On the contrary, the leaders of Huaian County have always attached importance to this work, organizing teachers to learn pronunciation, exchange experiences, including this work in the plan, and regularly checking and supervising it, so the language reform work in the county has been done very well. Secondly, language reform work is a mass work, and it is necessary to vigorously publicize and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. There are various ways to mobilize the masses, such as organizing evaluations and competitions. Particular attention should be paid to the close cooperation of the Communist Youth League and the trade union. For example, the Qingjiang City Education Trade Union held a teachers' Mandarin Chinese competition, and the Hai'an County Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Education Section held a children's Mandarin Chinese competition, which had a very good effect. While mobilizing the masses, it is also necessary to actively give play to the strength of experts, organize expert symposiums, publish articles, give reports, and guide dialect survey work to promote the progress of language reform work. Again, it is necessary to train backbones at all levels, so that the backbones can lead everyone to learn. Starting in 1956, the province selected teachers to study at the Central Voice Research Class. After returning to the province, they were responsible for the province's teacher training and promoted the language reform work in their units; the province also trained a group of backbones for various cities and counties, letting them be responsible for the training of teachers in the cities and counties. At the same time, the provincial and municipal and county teachers' colleges and schools, as well as the correspondence department of Nanjing Normal College, also taught the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese. This has trained the backbone and provided a strong guarantee for the gradual development of our province's work. After the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is approved at this conference, we will guide the leaders at all levels in the province to formulate specific plans to promote language reform work according to the actual conditions of each place, continue to do a good job in publicity, organize forces, implement it, and actively promote it in a focused and step-by-step manner; Give full play to the role of the phonetic alphabet in eliminating illiteracy, unifying pronunciation, and promoting Mandarin Chinese, so as to better serve the improvement of the cultural level of the people in our province and promote the socialist construction cause.

    多快好省地进行文化革命
    吴贻芳代表谈江苏省文字改革工作情况和意见
    我完全同意李先念副总理关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告以及薄一波副总理关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告。我们坚信：我国人民在胜利完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的基础上，经过全民整风和反右派斗争，亿万人民的革命干劲被激发起来，建设社会主义的积极性和创造性空前高涨，加以东风压倒西风这一有利的国际形势，一九五八年将是我国社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的一年，我们一定能够完成和超额完成一九五八年度的国民经济计划。
    吴玉章主任关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告，说明了文字改革是社会主义文化建设的一个重大措施。由于这一工作是有关全国人民文化传统和文化生活的一件大事，党和政府采取了积极的稳步前进的方针，是完全正确的。制定和推行汉语拼音方案以及简化汉字、推广普通话是当前文字改革工作的三项具体任务。我热烈拥护这个汉语拼音方案，并建议大会予以批准。现在，我就江苏省两年来的文字改革工作，提供一些简单的情况和意见。
    根据既慎重又积极的精神  汉字简化工作应继续推行
    我省在一九五五年全国文字改革会议以后，有计划地进行了广泛的宣传工作。两年来，我们编写了“文字在一定条件下必须改革”的小册子，出版了十一种计五十万册有关文字改革的读物，并通过报纸、杂志、电台以及利用图片、幻灯、报告会等进行宣传。一九五五年冬季，省和各市县组织了座谈会，邀请对文字学有研究的专家、师范和中、小学语文教师以及各界民主人士参加。经过讨论，大家认为：汉字有它发展的过程，在我国历史上有过不可磨灭的贡献；但是学习汉字是件困难的事。封建统治者和有闲阶级是希望人民愚昧无知的，他们掌握了文字，至于文字是否符合广大人民的需要，是漠不关心的。我们现在正在建设社会主义，要求全体人民都有文化。我们应当改变汉字难读、难写、难记的情况，使文字较容易地为广大人民掌握和使用。座谈会的结论是：汉字要简化，使它易写，并用拉丁字母注音，使它易读易记，以满足广大群众多年以来的愿望。根据我省各地参加座谈会的一万余人的统计，拥护简化汉字的占百分之九十点六，赞成使用拼音字母为汉字注音的占百分之九十六点四。
    关于简化汉字问题，自从一九五六年一月国务院公布汉字简化表后，我省各阶层人民都热烈欢迎和积极采用。南京市一个小学教师说，“国庆日、开大会，大家欢呼毛主席万岁”这一课内的繁体字原有九十八画，简化后只有三十九画，这使儿童们在学习祖国文字时节省多少时间和精力啊！同样的，广大劳动人民在政治上、经济上获得解放以后，迫切要求文化上的翻身，以适应他们参加政治、经济、文化活动的需用。他们的时间是宝贵的。他们要求用较少的时间识较多的字。所以说，现在的问题是简体字还嫌少了，还有不少比较常用而笔画较繁的字尚未简化。因此，我完全拥护吴玉章主任的意见：简化汉字工作应该根据既慎重又积极的精神，继续推进。
    方言隔阂影响了日常工作  推广普通话必须大力进行
    江苏境内方言复杂，并且部分方言和普通话差别较大，使我们在日常工作中感到许多不便。因此，我们对推广普通话这一工作的重大意义感受很深。以小学教师的调配问题为例，我省苏州专区小学教员过剩，徐州、淮阴专区不足，但是有些从苏南分配到苏北的师范毕业生不能安心工作。这固然是由于他们对人民教育事业不够热情、不够负责。但是言语不通，使得他们在教学和生活上诸多不便，也是一个实际问题。又如在农业改制中，我们要帮助农民学习先进生产经验，但是如果淮阴农民到松江去学种水稻，徐州农民到南通去学种棉花，因为方言隔阂，会带来很多困难。
    我省为了推广普通话，为各地培训语音训练班的讲师和辅导员，曾在南京举办了四期计有七百多个中小学教师参加的语音训练班。然后，各地也都分别举办了语音训练班。现在全省已有百分之六十三即七万五千多个小学教师、百分之三十六即六千多个中学教师学习了普通话，约有二分之一以上的中小学教师能用普通话进行教学，小学低年级儿童基本上已全部能用普通话朗诵课文，小学的中高年级和中学、师范的学生，在课堂内也多能用普通话朗读课文和回答问题。与推广普通话同时，为了进行方言调查工作，研究我省各地区方言语音与北京语音之间的对应规律，以便各方言区人民较容易地掌握北京语音，我们曾和上海市共同邀请了六所高等学校的有关教授和一些社会人士，举行了方言调查会议，成立了方言调查工作指导组。现在已经编出徐州、邳县、吴江等三个市、县的学习普通话手册，还有已交出版社的上海、苏州、无锡、扬州等四个市的学话手册，正在编写的常州、镇江、新海连等地的八、九本学话手册。预计在今年暑假前，可将全省各地学习普通话手册全部编写出来。
    自从文字改革委员会在一九五六年二月发表了汉语拼音方案第一个草案以后，我省各界人士特别是中小学教师已有不少人学习了拼音字母，大家并希望汉语拼音方案能够早日定案。现在，全省工农业生产全面跃进的高潮正在形成，劳动人民要求有一套便于学习汉字的工具、以便迅速提高自己文化水平的心情愈益迫切。不难想像，当这套拼音字母得到全面推广的时候，不论是扫除文盲、普及教育，或者是业余学习、提高技术，都会大大缩短时间。因此，我认为：这套拼音字母是在经济建设多快好省高潮中学习文化、推广普通话的多快好省的工具，是帮助劳动人民进行文化革命的有力武器。
    领导要重视文字改革工作  并且要发动群众的积极性
    两年来，我省在中央的正确领导下，在文字改革工作中虽已取得了一定的成绩，但是很不够的。我们在工作实践中体会到：做好这一工作的首要关键是领导重视。一九五六年由于省里对这一工作抓得比较紧，各地就形成了学习普通话和拼音字母的热潮；一九五七年下半年省里对这一工作过问稍少，各地就有松懈现象。各市县也有类似情况。徐州市一九五六年领导上抓得紧，教师几乎人人都用普通话教学；一九五七年领导上放松了，说普通话的人也就逐渐减少。相反的，淮安县领导一直重视这一工作，组织教师学习语音，交流经验，把这一工作列入计划，经常检查督促，县内文字改革工作就做得很好。其次，文字改革工作是一个群众性的工作，一定要大力宣传，发动群众的积极性。发动群众的办法是多种多样的，如组织评比、竞赛等，特别要重视青年团、工会的密切配合。如清江市教育工会举办了教师普通话比赛会，海安县青年团县委协同教育科举行儿童普通话比赛会等，效果很好。与发动群众同时，还要积极发挥专家的力量，组织专家座谈，发表文章、做报告、指导方言调查工作，以推动文字改革工作的进行。再次，还要层层训练骨干，使骨干带动大家学习。一九五六年开始，省选派教师到中央语音研究班学习，回省后负责省的师资培训和推动自己所在单位的文字改革工作；省里又为各市县培养一批骨干，让他们负责市县师资的培训工作。与此同时，省和各市、县教师进修院、校以及南京师范学院函授科，也都教学了拼音字母和普通话。这就培训了骨干，给我省逐步开展工作提供了有力的保证。在汉语拼音方案得到这次会议批准后，我们将引导省内各级领导根据各地实际情况，作出推进文字改革工作的具体方案，继续做好宣传工作，组织力量，贯彻实施。我们还打算抽调师范和中小学教师加以训练，使之成为推广拼音字母的骨干，在当地政府统一布置下进行传授，有重点有步骤地积极推行；发挥拼音字母在扫除文盲、统一读音、推广普通话中的作用，更好地为提高我省人民的文化水平和促进社会主义建设事业服务。
