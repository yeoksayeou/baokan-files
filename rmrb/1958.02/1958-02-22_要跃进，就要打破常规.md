To Leap Forward, We Must Break with Convention
Chen Dake

Our motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds. We have basically completed the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production, and are victoriously carrying out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This has unprecedentedly inspired the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to engage in socialist construction. The people of the whole country are advancing towards socialism with the heroic spirit of overwhelming mountains and seas, and with redoubled energy. They are full of vigor, full of energy, and demand to break with convention and bravely leap forward. However, consciousness always lags behind social existence. Especially in times of drastic historical change, some people's thinking will not keep up with the progress of the times. Therefore, they are panicked by this situation. According to them, this is an abnormal phenomenon: demanding to break with convention, that's terrible! The situation has developed, the tasks have changed, but their thinking is still stuck in the old place. They are satisfied with the achievements they have made, content with the status quo, and afraid of disrupting the normal state.

Yes, demanding to break with convention is an abnormal phenomenon for some people. But this is not bad at all, but very good! To make revolution, we must break with convention; to leap forward, we must also break with convention.

The so-called "convention" is opposed to "change." Constancy and change are a unity of opposites. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The relative permanence of all processes is relative, but the mutability of one process transforming into another is absolute." ("On Contradiction") This means that the unity of opposites is relative, while the struggle of opposites is absolute; under certain conditions, opposites will inevitably transform into each other. Therefore, breaking with convention is the struggle and transformation of opposites. This is also the inevitable law of the development of things.

The establishment of conventions is to maintain a certain order. It is a part of the social superstructure. The superstructure is always built on a certain economic base and serves a certain economic base. The old society had its own superstructure, and so does socialist society. Although they are fundamentally different, neither of them is immutable. In the old society, a minority of exploiters were in a ruling position, while the broad masses of laborers were in a ruled position, and this was an order. In order to maintain this order, the rulers established a superstructure suitable to their own interests, including various rules and regulations - conventions, in order to consolidate their exploitation and enslavement of the broad masses of laborers. However, Marx said: "At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production... Then comes the era of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation, the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed." Revolution is an earth-shaking change. It is a sudden change, a leap forward. To carry out revolution, it is necessary to transform through force, sweep away the old foundation, and change the old order. This also requires breaking the conventions that serve the old foundation and maintain the old order. In the revolutionary years of the past, we severed all the shackles on the people. The three great enemies were eliminated, and the people became the masters of the country; the ownership of capitalists and individual private owners was changed, and the means of production were owned by the whole people and collectively. This is an unprecedented change, a rapid and sudden leap forward. Without this change, without this leap forward, it would be impossible to overthrow the mountains that oppressed the people and destroy the shackles that bound the development of productive forces. And the working people becoming the ruling class, and the public ownership of the means of production, this is changing the old order and breaking the old conventions.

Now, in carrying out socialist construction, unless you don't leap forward, you don't need to break with convention. Of course, our relations of production are suitable for the nature of the productive forces, and our superstructure is also suitable for the needs of the economic base. However, in the development of socialism, the organization of the superstructure still needs to be constantly improved. Similarly, all rules and regulations, like all superstructures, also need to change with the changes of the economic base, with the growth of industry, agriculture, cadres, and the cultural level of the people. This is because the superstructure is determined by the economic base, and the superstructure also has its counter-effect. Reasonable rules and regulations will improve the masses' awareness and promote the development of production, while unreasonable rules and regulations will hinder the improvement of the masses' awareness and the development of production. For several years, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the work, various work departments have established some rules and regulations. However, precisely because these rules and regulations are established according to certain circumstances, the actual situation has changed, and the rules and regulations must also change accordingly. In the past eight years, we have completed three major reforms and three major transformations. Moreover, our country is a "poor and blank" big country, and we must quickly change this backward situation. This requires us to oppose the practice of slow and gradual progress, and constantly and rapidly leap forward. At present, a situation of overall leap forward has been launched in various places. Through this rectification movement, the broad masses have greatly improved their socialist awareness and have been liberated politically and ideologically. This liberated force is like the large amount of heat energy released by the fission of atomic nuclei. We are in an era of great leap forward, and the face of our motherland is changing with each passing day, and the development of construction is promising. However, many rules and regulations of various work departments have not changed, and they are already outdated for the new situation. Moreover, in our work, there are some rules and regulations that were originally unreasonable, and some were even inherited from the old society without any changes, and they are even more decadent and backward for the new situation. Therefore, we must have the courage to break these conventions. Only in this way can we adapt to the needs of the economic base, promote the development of productive forces, and improve the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.

Regarding this aspect, many units have already given us many outstanding examples. In school education, theory is divorced from practice and physical labor is despised. This is the convention of bourgeois education. However, in this rectification movement, some industrial and agricultural colleges have reversed this practice and boldly broken this convention. They let experimental equipment carry out production, and let teachers and students participate in productive labor. As a result, they greatly increased the wealth of the country, strengthened the students' concept of diligence and thrift, improved the quality of learning, and saved the country's education funds. Some enterprise employees have also exerted revolutionary energy and reformed unreasonable and outdated rules and regulations. Some enterprises used to stipulate some higher and wider safety awards and bonus awards, etc. At that time, these regulations played a certain role in ensuring safe production and completing production plans; but now the machinery and equipment have been improved, and the technical level has also been improved, therefore, some of the contents of these regulations can no longer meet the needs of production. Unreasonable and outdated reward systems not only cannot play a role in promoting production, but also play a role in hindering production. Therefore, these enterprises modified this reward plan through the broad masses of employees speaking out freely, thereby greatly promoting the upsurge of production enthusiasm.

Leap forward is revolution. To constantly leap forward, we must constantly make revolution. We are proponents of continuous revolution. We believe that everything is constantly changing, and similarly, there are no unchanging conventions in the world; everything is endlessly developing in the struggle with decaying things, and similarly, we must continuously break with conventions. Otherwise, they will become obstacles in our leap forward and hinder the development of socialist cause.

In order to carry out socialist construction in a more, faster, better and more economical way, we must be advanced proponents of continuous revolution, and not be backward conservatives.

### 要跃进，就要打破常规

    要跃进，就要打破常规
    陈大可
    祖国正在突飞猛进。我们已在生产资料所有制方面基本完成了社会主义革命，并且正在胜利地进行着政治上思想上的社会主义革命。这就空前地鼓舞了全国人民进行社会主义建设的热忱。全国人民正以排山倒海的英雄气概，精神百倍地奔向社会主义。他们朝气蓬勃，干劲十足，要求打破常规，奋勇跃进。但是，意识总是落后于社会存在的。特别是在历史急剧转变的时候，有些人的思想就会跟不上时代的前进。因此，他们对着这个局面，却惊惶失措起来。按照他们看来，这是一种反常现象：要求打破常规，这还了得！形势发展了，任务改变了，但是他们的思想还停留在老地方。他们满足于既得的成就，安于现状，唯恐破坏常态。
    是的，要求打破常规，这对某些人来说是一种反常现象。但是，这不是糟得很，而是好得很！要革命，就要打破常规；要跃进，也要打破常规。
    所谓“常”，是同“变”相对立的。常和变是对立的统一。毛泽东同志说：“一切过程的常住性是相对的，但是一种过程转化为他种过程的这种变动性则是绝对的。”（“矛盾论”）这就是说，对立面的统一是相对的，而对立面的斗争却是绝对的；在一定的条件下，对立面必然会相互转化。因此，打破常规，就是对立面的斗争和转化。这也就是事物发展的必然规律。
    常规的建立是为了维持一定的秩序的。它是社会上层建筑的一个部分。上层建筑总是建立在一定的经济基础上并为一定的经济基础服务的。旧社会有其自己的上层建筑，同样，社会主义社会也有其自己的上层建筑。虽然它们有着根本区别，但是它们都不是一成不变的。在旧社会，少数剥削者居于统治地位，而广大劳动者却居于被统治地位，这就是一种秩序。为了维持这种秩序，统治者就建立了适合于其自己利益的上层建筑，其中包括各种规章制度——常规，以便巩固他们对广大劳动者的剥削和奴役。但是，马克思说：“社会底物质生产力发展到一定程度时，便和它们向来在其中发展的那些现存生产关系……发生矛盾。……那时社会革命时代就到来了。随着经济基础的变更，于是全部庞大的上层建筑物中也就或迟或速地发生变革。”革命是翻天复地的变化。它是一个突变，是一个跃进。进行革命就要通过强力变革，扫除旧基础，改变旧秩序。这也就要打破那些为旧基础服务的、维护旧秩序的常规。在过去革命的年代中，我们斩断了一切人民身上的束缚。三大敌人被消灭了，人民成了国家的主人；资本家和个体私有者的所有制被改变了，生产资料归于全民和集体所有。这就是一个史无前例的变化，就是一个迅速突然的跃进。如果没有这个变化，没有这个跃进，那末推翻压迫人民的大山，摧毁束缚生产力发展的桎梏，是不可能的。而劳动人民成为统治阶级，生产资料的公有化，这就是改变旧秩序，打破旧常规。
    现在，在进行社会主义建设中，除非你不跃进，你才不要打破常规。当然，我们的生产关系是适合于生产力的性质的，我们的上层建筑也是适合于经济基础的需要的。但是，在社会主义发展中，上层建筑的组织仍需不断地加以改进。同样，一切规章制度也像所有上层建筑一样，也需随着经济基础的变化，随着工业、农业、干部和人民文化水平的增长而变化。这是因为上层建筑是为经济基础决定的，并且，上层建筑还有其反作用。合理的规章制度会提高群众觉悟和促进生产发展，而不合理的规章制度却会妨碍群众觉悟的提高和生产的发展。几年以来，为了保证工作的顺利进行，各个工作部门建立了一些规章制度。但是，正是由于这些规章制度都是根据一定的情况建立起来的，所以实际情况变了，规章制度也就必须随之改变。八年以来，我们已完成了三大改革，三大改造。并且，我国是一个“又白又穷”的大国，我们还要迅速改变这种落后的状况。这就要求我们反对那种滞缓渐进的作法，而不断地迅速地跃进。目前，一个全面跃进的形势已在各地展开。通过这次整风运动，广大群众已经大大地提高了社会主义的觉悟，在政治上思想上得到了解放，这种解放出来的力量，正有如原子核分裂放出的大量热能一样。我们正处身于一个大跃进的时代，我们祖国的面貌日新月异，建设事业的发展鹏程万里。但是，各个工作部门的许多规章制度仍旧没有改变，它们对于新的形势已经是陈旧不堪了。并且，在我们的工作中，还有一些规章制度原来就是不合理的，有的甚至是旧社会遗留下来原封未动的，它们对于新的形势就更是腐朽落后了。因此，我们就要有充分的勇气打破这些常规。只有这样，才能适应经济基础的需要，促进生产力的发展，提高群众的革命干劲。
    关于这个方面，目前不少单位已给我们作出了许多出色的榜样。在学校教育中，理论脱离实际、轻视体力劳动，这就是资产阶级教育的常规。但是，在这次整风运动中，有的工业和农业院校一反这种做法，大胆地打破了这种常规。他们让实验设备进行生产，让师生参加生产劳动。于是，他们就大大地增加了国家的财富，加强了学生的勤劳节俭观念，提高了学习的质量，并且节省了国家的教育资金。有些企业的职工也发挥了革命的干劲，改革了不合理的陈旧的规章制度。有的企业过去规定了一些较高较宽的安全奖和超额奖等。当时这些规定对保证安全生产、完成生产计划，是曾起过一定作用的；但是现在机器设备有了改进，技术水平也有了提高，因此，这些规定的某些内容已不能适应生产需要了。不合理的陈旧的奖励制度，不仅不能起促进生产的作用，反而起了促退生产的作用。于是，这些企业通过广大职工大鸣大放，修改了这种奖励方案，从而就大大地促进了生产积极性的高涨。
    跃进就是革命。我们要不断跃进，就是要不断革命。我们是不断革命论者。我们认为，一切事物都是不断变化着的，同样，世界上也决没有不变的常规；一切事物都是在同衰颓的东西进行斗争中无休止地发展着的，同样，我们也要连续不断地打破常规。否则，它们就会成为我们跃进中的障碍，阻挡社会主义事业的发展。
    为了又多又快又好又省地进行社会主义建设，我们要做先进的不断革命论者，不要做落后的保守主义者。
