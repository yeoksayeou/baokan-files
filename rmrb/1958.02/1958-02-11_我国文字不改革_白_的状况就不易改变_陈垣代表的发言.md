Without Reforming Chinese Characters, the Situation of "Being Backward" Will Not Easily Change
Speech by Representative Chen Yuan

I completely agree with the reports made to the congress by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.

Recently, I have been feeling excited and invigorated. Triumphant news keeps pouring in from all fronts, and everything is advancing by leaps and bounds. Our nation is truly full of hope, and our cause is truly promising. In the short nine years since the national liberation, thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country, which was plagued by disasters and was semi-feudal and semi-colonial, has been transformed into a new and improved state like today, and is leaping forward at an incredible speed. The Chinese people have not only stood up bravely and firmly, but we have also started running! Our 600 million hard-working and courageous people are united to race against time. We have endless power, which can not only change customs and habits but also move mountains and overturn the earth. At the first meeting of our congress, Chairman Mao said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." Yes, our cause is unprecedented and has never been seen before. Things that could not be solved in thousands of years have been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and in the hands of the people! In such a heroic and glorious era, in the face of the heroic spirit and revolutionary vigor of the national workers and peasants, intellectuals like us truly feel ashamed on the one hand, and on the other hand, feel that we must work a hundred times harder, learn, transform, and contribute all our strength.

I would like to say a few words specifically on the issue of language reform.

Chairman Mao said that our country is "poor" and "backward." That is to say, we are still very poor economically and very backward culturally. To change this situation of "being poor and backward," we must not only fight hard in the economy and other aspects, but also come up with various measures in the popularization and improvement of culture so that the working people of the whole country can master culture as soon as possible, so as to build our country better and faster. The implementation of language reform is the best measure to popularize and improve culture. Therefore, we must vigorously promote it; otherwise, "being backward" will not easily change. Therefore, this is a major event in the cultural life of our people, and it is something that everyone should not ignore.

The current Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is more complete than any previous one.

Books with Chinese text marked with Latin letters appeared as early as the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. I have seen two of them, both written by people from Huizhou. One is "Cheng's Ink Garden," which is about ink making. It used various pictures as styles for ink making. Some of them were religious pictures. The book contains a title by Matteo Ricci, which is phoneticized with Latin letters. The other is Wang Tingne's "Ipu," which is about Go. It contains a passage of greeting written by Matteo Ricci in Latin letters, but when read together, it does not make sense. Later, I discovered that each word was originally cut and pieced together from "Ink Garden." The reason he did this was just to show off the breadth of his social circle. In 1927, I printed the Roman letter phonetic transcription in "Ink Garden" and Wang's forged greeting from Matteo Ricci, and added textual research, entitled "Europeanized Art and Roman Letter Phonetic Transcription in the Late Ming Dynasty." I heard that the Language Reform Publishing House has reprinted this book, named "Roman Letter Phonetic Transcription Articles in the Late Ming Dynasty."

In Matteo Ricci's view, he wanted to use Latin letters to help foreign missionaries learn Chinese characters. Cheng only felt curious and novel, and did not mean to make it easy to read and recognize. Wang was simply deceiving people. However, it can be seen that not many people knew about Latin letter phonetic transcription at that time, so he dared to fake it to shock the world and show off his customs.

This is the earliest use of Latin letters to phoneticize Chinese characters. In the more than 300 years since then, some foreign missionaries have adopted other phonetic methods. In the past 60 years, many patriotic people and linguists in our country have actively advocated language reform and created various phonetic schemes.

Now we have traced back more than 300 years of history and summarized 60 years of experience to formulate the current Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. This scheme absorbs many useful things from predecessors and is indeed more complete than any previous one. After the first draft of this scheme was published in February 1956, it widely solicited opinions from all parties and repeatedly studied and discussed it. We are extremely responsible and cautious about this issue, and it is by no means as the rightists say that it was done by a small number of people behind closed doors.

We should consider issues from the perspective of the interests of the whole people and carry out language reform with a revolutionary spirit.

The number of Chinese characters is large, and the strokes are complicated, making it difficult for people to learn, remember, read, and write. When we were young, we spent a lot of time learning. When we recognized characters, we recognized them by rote, and if we couldn't remember them, the teacher would hit our palms. It was hard work to recognize a few characters. If there was really no shortcut, it would be okay to work hard, but now that there is obviously a shortcut, we should not still take the old path.

Historically, the working people of our country have had no opportunity to master culture. Naturally, this is mainly caused by the social system and the reactionary ruling class, and the complexity of Chinese characters is also one of the important reasons. If the past economic foundation is not changed, it will of course be difficult to improve the cultural level of the whole people. After the change of ownership today, if the characters are not reformed, the complexity of Chinese characters will still be a great obstacle, and it will not be easy to rapidly improve the cultural level of our country. After the reform of Chinese characters, it will be easy to recognize and write due to the simplification of Chinese characters; it will be easy to read with phonetic transcription; and the unification of language will be gradual through the universal promotion of Mandarin Chinese. At that time, there will be great changes in the cultural level of our country. In fact, Chinese characters are now far behind the objective needs of China's social development in many ways. Therefore, we must be brave, bold, and use a revolutionary spirit to carry out language reform. This is the need of today's historical development, and it is also an important task that is related to the happiness of the broad masses of working people and future generations.

In this work, we intellectuals who have mastered culture should play an active role and should strive to support this work, and not stand by and treat it passively. However, there are also some people who think that they have already learned Chinese characters, and that language reform has little to do with them, so they do not pay attention to or care about this matter, and even have various concerns, which is very bad. Our language reform is considered from the interests of 600 million people, is for the sake of the majority, and is for the sake of the working people and future generations who do not yet know how to read but will definitely learn to read in the future. We should consider this from the interests of the whole people and from the urgent demands of the broad masses of working people, and not just from personal habits and temporary convenience.

This is a major event and also a new thing. In the past, we did not publicize it enough, which caused some people to be indifferent, and some people even had some misunderstandings. I have a friend who was a little unaccustomed to the use of simplified characters when they first appeared in the newspaper. He heard that phonetic writing would be used later, and felt that it was not very good, so he did not ask about this work. However, after the Premier Zhou's report was published in the newspaper, he carefully and repeatedly read the full text of the report, and then realized the importance of language reform. He said that language reform turned out to be like this, the method is too good, the government thought it too well. So he actively supported this work and took the initiative to promote it to his friends. From this point of view, we must strengthen publicity work in the future to make everyone understand the important significance of language reform, so that resistance will be reduced and efficiency will be improved during implementation.

Teacher education workers have an unshirkable responsibility for promoting language reform.

We teacher education workers have an even more inescapable responsibility for promoting language reform. Our Beijing Normal University has established a working committee to promote Mandarin Chinese, preparing to train backbones, promote work, and use phonetic letters to promote Mandarin Chinese. We have included it in this year's work program. In the future, under the leadership of the Party, with the guidance of language reform expert Mr. Li Jinxi and the joint efforts of our teachers and students, we must carry out this work in a planned way.

At the same time, I hope that every teacher education worker in our country will take active action and become a promoter of language reform, contributing to cultural construction.

Let us popularize and improve culture as soon as possible and change the backward state of culture in our country. Let us jointly participate in this unprecedented feat and build our motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science.

    我国文字不改革  “白”的状况就不易改变
    陈垣代表的发言
    我完全同意李先念、薄一波副总理，彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向大会所作的报告。
    最近这些时候，一直都使我感到心情激动，精神振奋，各个战线上的捷报频传，事事都在突飞猛进，我们的民族真是大有希望，我们的事业真是大有可为。在全国解放短短的九年中，由于伟大的共产党、毛主席英明正确的领导，才把我们一个灾难重重、半封建半殖民地的国家，改变成今天这样的面貌一新，并且在一日千里的飞跃向前。中国人民不但英勇坚强的站起来了，而且我们跑起来了！我们六亿勤劳勇敢的人民团结起来，要和时间赛跑，我们有无穷无尽的力量，不仅可以移风易俗，而且可以排山倒海，覆地翻天。在我们的大会第一次会议上，毛主席说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”是的，我们的事业，是史无前例的，是前无古人的，几千几百年也没办法解决的事情，在共产党领导下在人民的手里都作出来了！在这样豪迈光荣的时代，在全国工农大军的英雄气概和革命干劲的面前，像我们这样的知识分子，真是一方面觉得惭愧，一方面觉得更要百倍努力，学习、改造，贡献出自己所有的力量。
    我现在单就文字改革的问题讲几句话。
    毛主席说，我国是一“穷”二“白”，那就是说我们在经济上还很贫困，文化上还很落后，要改变这样“又穷又白”的情况，不但在经济上以及其他方面还要苦战，在文化的普及和提高上，也要想出种种措施，使得全国劳动人民尽快的掌握文化，才能更加迅速的建设好我们的国家。文字改革的推行，就是普及和提高文化最好的措施。因此我们必需大力推行，不然，“白”就不易改变。所以说这是我国人民文化生活中的一件大事，是我们每个人都不应忽视的事情。
    现在的汉语拼音方案比以前的任何一种都更加完善
    有拉丁字母标注汉文的书，早在明朝万历年间就有了，我曾见过两部，都是徽州人著的。一部是“程氏墨苑”，是讲制墨的，他采用了各种图画做为制墨的式样，有几种是宗教的图画，书中有利玛窦的题词，就是用拉丁字母注音的。另一部是汪廷讷的“奕谱”，是讲围棋的，内有利玛窦用拉丁字写的赠言一段，但连念起来，不成文理，后来我才发现他原来每一个字都是从“墨苑”里剪下来拼凑而成的。他所以如此，不过是为了想炫示他交游的广阔。一九二七年，我曾将“墨苑”中的罗马字注音，及汪氏伪造利玛窦赠言影印出来，并加以考释，名为“明季之欧化美术及罗马字注音”，听说文字改革出版社已将此书重印，名“明末罗马字注音文章”。
    在利玛窦的意思，是想用拉丁字母来帮助外国传教士学习汉字。程氏则只是好奇，觉得新鲜，并没有使人易读易识的意思。汪氏则简直是骗人。不过因此可知当时认识拉丁字母注音的人还不多，所以他才敢于作假以惊世炫俗。
    这是最早采用拉丁字母来给汉字注音的。三百多年以来，又有一些外国教士采用其他拼音方式；最近六十年来，我国的许多爱国人士、语文学者，更都积极提倡文字改革，并且创制了各种拼音方案。
    我们现在追溯了三百多年的历史，并总结了六十年来的经验，制订了现在的汉语拼音方案。这个方案吸取了前人许多有益的东西，确实比以前的任何一种都更加完善。一九五六年二月，这方案的第一个草案发表后，又广泛的征求了各方面的意见，反复研究讨论。对这个问题，我们是极其负责和慎重的，绝不像右派分子们所说只是少数人关起门来搞的。
    应该从全民利益来考虑问题　用革命精神来进行文字改革
    汉字的数目多，笔画繁，使人难学难记，难读难写，我们幼学的时候，都是费了很多时间，认字时都是生吞活剥的认，记不住塾师就要打手心，好辛苦才认识几个字。如果真是并无捷径，辛苦点也应该，但现在明明有了捷径，我们就不应仍走旧路。
    在历史上，我国历代的劳动人民都没有机会掌握文化，自然主要是社会制度和反动统治阶级所造成，而汉字的繁难也是重要原因之一。过去的经济基础不改变，全民文化水平提高当然有困难，在今天所有制改变以后，如果文字不改革，由于汉字的繁难，仍是一个很大的阻碍，我国文化水平还不易迅速提高。文字改革以后，由于汉字简化，就易认易写了；用拼音文字注音，就易读了；普通话普遍推广，语言就逐渐统一了。那时我国的文化水平，就会有很大的变化。事实上汉字在许多方面现在已经远远落后于我国社会发展的客观需要，因此，我们一定要勇敢的，大胆的，用革命的精神，来进行文字改革。这是今天历史的发展需要，也是关系着广大劳动人民和子孙后代幸福的一件重要工作。
    在这个工作上，我们掌握了文化的知识分子，应当起积极的作用，应当努力支持这一工作，不能袖手旁观，消极对待。但是，也还有一些人，认为自己已经学会了汉字，文字改革与自己关系不大，所以对这件事不注意、不关心，甚至有种种顾虑，这是很不好的。我们的文字改革，是从六亿人民的利益考虑的，是为多数人着想的，是为现在还不认识字而将来一定要认字的劳动人民与子孙后代着想的。我们应当从全民利益来考虑，从广大劳动人民的迫切要求来考虑，不应仅从个人的习惯和一时的方便来看这个问题。
    这是一件大事，也是一件新事，过去我们的确是宣传不够，以致造成一些人的漠不关心，甚至还有人有些误解。我有一个朋友，当报上开始用简体字时，他有些看不惯，听说以后还要改用拼音文字，觉得总是不太好，因此就对这工作不闻不问，但是在报上公布了周总理的报告以后，他仔细的反复的阅读了报告的全文，才认识到文字改革的重要，他说文字改革原来是这样，办法太好了，政府想得太周到了，于是他就积极支持这一工作，并主动的去向朋友们宣传。由此看来，今后我们还要加强宣传工作，要使人人都了解文字改革的重要意义，则推行时，就会减少阻力，提高效率。
    师范教育工作者对推行文字改革工作有不可推卸的责任
    我们师范教育工作者，对推行文字改革工作更有不可推却的责任。我们北京师大已成立了推广普通话工作委员会，准备培养骨干，推动工作，用拼音字母来推广普通话。我们已把它订在今年的工作纲要里面。今后我校在党的领导下，并有文字改革专家黎锦熙先生的指导和我们师生的共同努力，一定要把这工作有计划的开展起来。
    同时也希望我们全国的每一个师范教育工作者，都积极行动起来，都来作一个文字改革工作的促进派，在文化建设上出一把力。
    让我们来尽快的普及和提高文化，改变我国文化落后状态。让我们来共同参加这史无前例的壮举，把祖国建设成一个拥有现代工业、现代农业、现代文化科学的社会主义强国吧。
