Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots Brave the Rain to Queue in "Long Lines"
To See the "Yangtze River Bridge" Documentary

This newspaper reports that the "Yangtze River Bridge" film, produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, has been screened in Kowloon, Hong Kong, since February 1st, and in Macao since February 7th. The screening of the film has been warmly welcomed by compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao. The Ping An Theatre in Kowloon, where the film premiered, saw a surge in advance ticket sales two days before the opening. Despite the rain, a "long line" of people queuing to buy tickets in advance persisted from morning to night in front of the theater. This enthusiastic scene has not been seen for more than twenty years.

The audience included not only compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macao and social celebrities, but also many foreigners. When the title credits of the "Yangtze River Bridge" appeared on the screen, the audience applauded enthusiastically. When the bridge was completed, and thousands of people surged forward to present flowers to the builders of the bridge, the audience burst into another round of warm applause. When the bridge officially opened to traffic, the audience applauded and cheered even more.

Many viewers have written letters expressing their feelings after watching the film, and are proud of the achievements of the great socialist construction cause of the motherland. Hong Kong and Macao newspapers published many news reports, commentaries, and pictures during the screening of the film, and many people also wrote poems in praise. The Hong Kong Southern Film Company specially compiled and printed a beautiful album for the screening of the film; the Ping An Theatre installed a three-dimensional model advertisement as long as one hundred feet outside the front wall of the theatre, with vehicles moving and walking on the bridge, shining brightly at night. Watercolors of the bridge by the painter Chen Fushen and oil paintings of the bridge by Chen Haiying and Li Liudan were also displayed in the hall of the Ping An Theatre for the audience to appreciate.

    港澳同胞冒雨排“长龙”
    争看“长江大桥”纪录片
    本报讯　中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制的“长江大桥”一片，已于2月1日起在香港九龙公映，澳门也于7日起参加联映。该片的公映，受到港澳同胞热烈欢迎。首映该片的九龙平安戏院在开映前两天就出现了预订门票盛况。虽然天雨，但从早到晚戏院门前始终有着一条冒雨预购门票的“长龙”。这种热烈情景是二十多年来未曾有过的。
    该片观众不仅有港澳各界同胞和社会名流，而且还有不少外国人士。当银幕上映出“长江大桥”的片头字幕时，观众就热烈鼓掌起来；当大桥合拢，成千人群涌去给大桥的建设者献花时，观众又响起了一阵热烈的掌声；当大桥正式通车的时候，观众更为之鼓掌欢呼。
    许多观众都纷纷写信表达他们的观后感想，为祖国的伟大社会主义建设事业的成就而自豪。港澳报刊在该片映出期间发表了许多新闻、评论和图片，还有不少人赋诗赞颂。香港南方影业公司特为该片的映出编印了一本精美的画册；平安戏院在门前大墙外装置了一座长达百呎的立体模型广告，大桥上有车辆活动行走，入晚大放光明。画家陈福善的大桥水采画和陈海鹰、李流丹的大桥油画，也陈列在平安戏院大厅，供观众欣赏。
