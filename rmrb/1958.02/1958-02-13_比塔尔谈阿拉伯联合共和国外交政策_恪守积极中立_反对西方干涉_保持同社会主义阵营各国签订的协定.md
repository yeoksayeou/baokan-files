Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 11th. According to a report from Damascus by a reporter from the Indian Press Trust, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said on the 10th that the foreign policy of the United Arab Republic will be the "same old policy" of active neutrality pursued by Egypt and Syria.

Bitar said when meeting with reporters that the strength of Syria and Egypt's active neutrality and non-alignment policy lies in the fact that the entire Arab public opinion supports it. "That is why we never talk from the government but from the position of the Arab people who constitute the basic elements. Governments can change, but the people cannot."

When the reporter asked about the economic and cultural agreements signed by Syria with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, Bitar said, "These agreements were concluded on the basis of active neutrality, and active neutrality will be the policy of the new country; these two facts indicate that these agreements will continue to exist as such."

When talking about the new country's relations with Western countries, Bitar said: "Past experience makes us hold a cautious attitude towards them. These countries have often plotted conspiracies against Syria and Egypt in the past, and they may still do something in the future."

Bitar said: "I don't think there will be any dramatic changes in the new country's relations with Britain and France. The fact is that negotiations are currently underway between Egypt and the United Kingdom, and the relationship between the new country and Britain will mainly depend on the results of these negotiations."

The reporter asked whether the new country would propose talks with the United States to discuss U.S. Middle East policy, including the Eisenhower Doctrine. Bitar said, "Future talks with the United States may be beneficial, but the main thing is that the new country's political attitude and its policies will convince the United States and other Western countries that it is useless to interfere in the affairs of this region any further." Bitar said: "Our experience shows that the clear and practical dangers we currently and will face come from imperialism and Zionism. We believe that this is what we are facing. Our foreign policy takes this fact into account, so we believe that only through active neutrality can we defend ourselves from international threats."

Bitar also stated that the United Arab Republic will insist on continuing the struggle against the Baghdad Pact.

Bitar also said: The United Arab Republic will welcome the Soviet Union's proposal to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

### 比塔尔谈阿拉伯联合共和国外交政策  恪守积极中立　反对西方干涉  保持同社会主义阵营各国签订的协定

    比塔尔谈阿拉伯联合共和国外交政策
    恪守积极中立　反对西方干涉
    保持同社会主义阵营各国签订的协定
    据新华社新德里11日电　据印度报业托辣斯记者从大马士革报道，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔10日说，阿拉伯联合共和国的外交政策将是埃及和叙利亚所奉行的积极中立的“同一个老政策”。
    比塔尔在接见记者时说，叙利亚和埃及的积极中立和不参加集团的政策的力量在于这一事实：整个阿拉伯舆论都支持它。“这就是为什么我们从来不从政府而是从构成基本因素的阿拉伯人民的地位来谈的原因。政府可以变换，而人民是不能变换的。”
    当这位记者问起叙利亚同苏联以及其他人民民主国家签订的经济和文化协定时，比塔尔说，“这些协定是在积极中立的基础上缔结的，而积极中立将是新国家的政策；这两个事实表明，这些协定将继续那样存在下去”。
    在谈到新国家同西方国家的关系时，比塔尔说：“过去的经验使我们对于它们的态度抱谨慎的态度。这些国家过去是常常策划反对叙利亚、埃及的阴谋的，将来它们也还可能干些什么。”
    比塔尔说：“我不认为新国家同英法两国的关系会有什么戏剧化的改变。事实是：谈判现在正在埃及和联合王国之间进行，新国家和英国之间的关系主要将取决于这些谈判的结果。”
    记者问到新国家是否会倡议同美国进行会谈，讨论美国的中东政策，包括艾森豪威尔主义在内。比塔尔说，“将来同美国会谈可能是有益的，但是主要的事情是：新国家的政治态度和它的政策将使美国以及其他西方国家相信：再要对这一地区的事务进行任何干涉都是没有用的。”比塔尔说：“我们的经验表明，我们目前和将来所遭受的明确实际的危险来自帝国主义和犹太复国主义。我们认为这就是说我们所面对的危险。我们的外交政策考虑到这样一个事实，所以我们认为，只有通过积极中立，我们才能保卫我们自己，不受国际威胁”。
    比塔尔还表示，阿拉伯联合共和国将坚持进行反对巴格达条约的斗争。
    比塔尔还说：阿拉伯联合共和国将欢迎苏联提出的使中东成为无原子武器地区的建议。
