Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th: The Daye Steel Plant's electric furnace workshop has adhered to the mass line in its production technology work, enabling the quality of steel ingots to jump from last place among similar steel plants nationwide to first place. From January to mid-February this year, the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 99.89%, exceeding the national advanced level of 1957. The quality qualification rate of the vast majority of steelmaking shifts in the entire workshop reached 100% in January, thereby changing the backward situation of poor product quality that had long existed in the plant and catching up with the national advanced ranks.

The severe "subcutaneous bubbles" in electric furnace steel ingots have been an important reason for the poor product quality of this steel plant for a long time. Since the second half of 1955, the electric furnace workshop began to mobilize employees to organize a major transformation in quality by relying on them. On the one hand, they used methods such as detailed accounting, holding exhibitions, and giving reports to expose the national economic losses caused by poor quality, educating employees to establish the idea of doing a good job in quality; on the other hand, a test research group was organized, headed by Sun Xindong, deputy director and engineer of the workshop, and some technicians, according to the recommendations of Soviet experts, selected key points and conducted a series of experiments with shifts. After finding out the cause of the "subcutaneous bubbles" in the experiment, a specific medicine was prescribed, and practical and feasible measures were taken. After repeated trials and summaries, the final plan was finalized and incorporated into the regulations.

In the process of experimental research, the workers put forward many good methods, which enriched the technical management work of the steel plant. Leading cadres and technicians of the electric furnace workshop also went deep into the work shifts and workers' residential areas, using forms such as symposiums, production meetings of the same type of work, observation performances, and key demonstrations to summarize and promote the advanced experience of workers in improving product quality.

    大冶钢厂发动群众促进生产技术大转变
    电炉钢质量从全国末名跃居首位
    据新华社武汉27日电　大冶钢厂电炉车间在生产技术工作中坚持群众路线的工作方法，使钢锭质量从全国同类钢厂中的最后一名跃居为第一名。今年1月到2月中旬，钢锭合格率达到99.89％，超过1957年全国先进水平。全车间绝大部分炼钢班1月份的质量合格率，都达到了百分之百，从而改变了全厂长期以来存在的产品质量低劣的落后局面，赶上了全国先进行列。
    电炉钢锭“皮下气泡”严重，是较长期以来造成这个钢厂产品质量低劣的重要原因。从1955年下半年起，电炉车间开始发动职工，依靠职工来组织质量大转变。他们一方面用算细账、办展览会、作报告等形式，揭发质量低劣造成国家经济损失的情况，教育职工树立搞好质量的思想；另一方面，以车间副主任、工程师孙欣栋为首，组织部分技术人员，成立了试验研究小组，根据苏联专家建议，选定重点，跟班进行一系列的试验。在试验中找出产生“皮下气泡”的原因以后，就对症下药，采取切实可行的措施。这样经过多次反复试验、总结，最后定案，把它纳入规程。
    在试验研究过程中，工人们提出了许多好的办法，丰富了钢厂的技术管理工作。电炉车间的领导干部和技术人员，也都深入班组、工人住宅区，运用座谈会、同工种生产会、观摩表演、重点示范等形式，总结和推广工人在提高产品质量方面的先进经验。
