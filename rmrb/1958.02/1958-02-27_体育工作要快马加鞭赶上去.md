    Sports Work Must Pick Up the Pace
    Cao Di
    The nation is currently in a high tide of socialist construction, with rapid leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and other areas of work. Under this new situation, in order to better serve production and construction, sports work must also catch up in a timely manner. Sports workers should exert revolutionary drive and make the sports cause also take a great leap forward.
    In recent years, China's sports cause has already made considerable achievements. More and more people are participating in sports activities, and sports have played a significant role in enhancing people's health and promoting production. The level of sports has improved by leaps and bounds, and outstanding athletes such as Chen Jingkai, Qi Lieyun, and Zheng Fengrong, who have broken world records, have emerged. However, it should be seen that the achievements we have already made in sports are very disproportionate to our great nation of over six hundred million people and our lofty international status. Looking at the current situation of the great leap forward across the country, China's sports cause must pick up the pace even more.
    Today's publication of the news about the Shanghai conference of ten thousand sports activists marks that sports work has also begun to leap forward. In 1957, more than 1.3 million people in Shanghai, with a population of seven million, regularly participated in sports activities. This time, their leap forward plan includes a goal of reaching four million people regularly participating in sports activities in 1958. They also plan to reach world level in thirteen sports within ten years, of which nine will break world records. Their slogan is: "Everyone participates in ten minutes of sports activities every day, striving to work ten more years for socialism." What a heroic leap forward plan this is! In addition to Shanghai, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, also held a conference on February 17 to promote the great leap forward in sports work. They set the target of catching up with Tianjin in terms of sports level and surpassing Tianjin in developing mass sports. Changzhou, Jiangsu, once proposed a sports competition initiative to several brother cities in the province. Sixteen universities in Jiangsu have also launched inter-school sports socialist revolution competitions and have proposed competition initiatives to universities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Many other places and units are also formulating sports leap forward plans or launching sports work competitions. Shanghai, Tangshan, Changzhou and other places, they have become pioneers in the great leap forward in sports and have set a good example. It is hoped that other regions will compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and not fall behind in the leap forward.
    A mass sports upsurge has been set off in many places, and more people will participate in sports activities in the future. Only in this way can sports better serve production and construction, and can we achieve the goal of catching up with international levels in major sports in about ten years.

    体育工作要快马加鞭赶上去
    曹弟
    目前全国正处在社会主义建设的高潮中，工农业生产以及其他方面的工作都在大踏步地向前跃进。在这个新形势下，为了更好地为生产和建设服务，体育工作也必须及时赶上去，体育工作者们应该发挥革命干劲，让体育事业也来个大跃进。
    几年来，我国体育事业已经有了不小的成就。参加体育活动的人越来越多，体育运动在增强人民体质、促进生产方面起了显著的作用；运动水平飞跃提高，出现了陈镜开、戚烈云、郑凤荣等创造世界纪录的优秀运动员。但是应该看到，我们在体育运动上已获得的这点成就，同我们六亿多人民的伟大国家和我们崇高的国际地位是很不相称的。再看一看目前全国大跃进的形势，我国体育事业更必须快马加鞭赶上去。
    今天本报发表的上海召开一万体育活动分子大会的事，就标志着体育工作也已开始向前跃进。七百万人口的上海，在1957年有一百三十多万人经常参加体育活动。这次，他们的跃进规划中计划1958年经常参加体育活动的要达到四百万人。他们还规划在十年内有十三个项目达到世界水平，其中有九个项目打破世界纪录。他们提出的口号是：“每人每天参加十分钟体育活动，争取为社会主义多工作十年”，这是个多么豪迈的跃进规划。除上海外，河北唐山市也在2月17日召开了促进体育工作跃进大会，他们订出指标，要在运动水平方面赶上天津，在开展群众体育方面赶过天津。江苏常州曾向该省几个兄弟城市提出体育竞赛倡议。江苏的十六所大学也开展了校际体育社会主义革命竞赛，并向北京、上海、天津的高等学校提出竞赛倡议。还有不少地方和单位也在制订体育跃进规划或展开体育工作竞赛。上海、唐山、常州等地，他们成了体育大跃进中的先行者，做出了好榜样。希望其他各地，要比先进、学先进、赶先进，不要在跃进中落了后。
    群众性的体育运动高潮已在不少地方掀起了，今后会有更多的人来参加体育活动。只有这样，才能使体育运动更好地为生产和建设服务，才能做到使我国体育运动在十年左右在主要项目上赶上国际水平。
