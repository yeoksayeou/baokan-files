    Lunaphobia
    Nikolayev
    U.S. Congressman Kennedy Keetchin looks up at the sky over Washington every night, worrying that missiles launched from Mars or Venus will fall on his head. He feels that first-magnitude stars are posing a threat to him, smaller stars are so suspicious, and the silvery moon seems to have dimmed due to atomic or hydrogen bomb explosions.
    According to Mr. Keetchin, the achievements of modern science will lead to "an unprecedented danger of devastating human civilization." He guesses that humans will fly to the moon and other planets. If other planets are suitable for human habitation, then "interstellar war" will certainly occur. Because if a country can establish its rule on the moon, it will certainly "expand" its rule to Earth, using the moon as its rocket launch base to attack Earth. Any planet could launch an "attack" on Washington at any time in the future. Therefore, he hysterically clamors about the danger of "interstellar war," urging Americans to reconsider the "defense" of the "free world," that is, not only to consider how to "defend" against the Bolsheviks on Earth, but also to "defend" against the possible "attacks" of residents of Mars and other planets in the future.
    One day, Keetchin told a representative of New York Radio that the Soviet Union would defeat the Americans in flying to the moon and other planets. While the conquest of outer space is still in its infancy, the United States should "take immediate action" through the United Nations, by formulating "interstellar space navigation regulations" or other means.
    This congressman is now making detailed plans to seize the moon, thinking that it is not useless to make such plans before the United States can launch rockets to the moon.
    Keetchin's interstellar war mania is no less than that of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal. Forrestal once climbed a skyscraper due to war mania and jumped from the building into the street. Now, for Mr. Keetchin, the skyscraper is still too low, and he seems to want to jump down from the moon and other planets as stepping stones to be satisfied. This interstellar phobia prevalent among some people in the United States has developed on the basis of the phobia of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two systems. The only difference is that interstellar phobia appears in the moonlight. (Abridged translation from "Soviet Russia Daily" - Xinhua News Agency) (With picture)

    恐月病
    尼古拉耶夫
    美国国会议员肯尼迪·基钦每天夜里仰望华盛顿的天空，顾虑着从火星或金星上发射下来的导弹将会落到他的头上。他感觉，一等星象是向他摆着威胁的姿态，小一点的星星是那末形迹可疑，发着银白色光辉的月亮也像是因原子弹或氢弹的爆炸而黯然失色了。
    照基钦先生的意见，现代科学的成就将会导致“史无前例的人类文明备受摧残的危险”。他猜想，人类将会飞上月球，还会飞往其他星球。如果其他星球适于人类居住的话，那么，肯定会发生“星际战争”。因为，如果有一个国家能够在月球上建立它的统治的话，那么，它就必定会将它的统治“扩张”到地球，将月球作为它的火箭发射基地，对地球进行攻击。任何星球将来都有可能随时发动对华盛顿的“进攻”。因此，他歇斯底里地到处叫嚣“星际战争”的危险，要美国人重新考虑“自由世界”的“防务”问题，那就是说，不但要考虑如何“防御”地球上的布尔什维克，而且要“防御”火星等行星上的居民将来可能的“攻击”。
    有一天，基钦对纽约广播电台的代表说，苏联在飞向月球和其他星球方面将会击败美国人。趁征服宇宙空间的工作尚处在胚胎时期的时候，美国就应该通过联合国，通过制订“星际空间航行条例”或其他办法而“立刻行动起来”。
    这位议员现在正进行拟定侵占月球的详尽计划，他想，在美国能够将火箭发射上月球之前，作这种筹划并不是无益的。
    基钦这种星际战争狂谵症比起美国前国防部长福莱斯特尔来并不逊色。福莱斯特尔当年曾因患战争狂热症而登上摩天大厦，从楼上往街心跳下。现在，对基钦先生来说，摩天大厦还嫌过于低矮，他似乎想把月球和其他行星当作跳板跳下来才心满意足。这种流行于美国某些人士中间的星际恐惧病是在对和平共处和两个制度和平竞赛的恐惧病的基础上发展起来的。所不同的是，星际恐惧病是在月光下显现罢了。（节译自“苏维埃俄罗斯报”——新华社）（附图片）
