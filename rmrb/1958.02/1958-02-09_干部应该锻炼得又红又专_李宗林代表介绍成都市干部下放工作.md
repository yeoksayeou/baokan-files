　　I fully agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft of the 1958 National Budget," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft of the 1958 National Economic Plan," and Director Wu Yuzhang's "Report on the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme."

　　Now I will give the conference a brief report on the issue of cadre downward transfer in Chengdu:

　　An Important Part of the Rectification Campaign

　　In the government system, some people are inefficient; in enterprises, the proportion of non-production personnel is too large. Some young intellectuals cannot withstand the tests of storms. Therefore, cadre downward transfer is not only necessary but also a matter of urgency.

　　The rectification movement in Chengdu's government offices is currently in the rectification and improvement phase. One of the main tasks of this phase is to streamline institutions and transfer cadres downward. Streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward is a major revolutionary measure in our country's current socialist revolution and construction. Chairman Mao pointed out its significant political meaning in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his "Report on the Rectification Movement" at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, further explained in detail the great significance of streamlining institutions and reducing non-production personnel for the cause of national construction. We believe that these central directives are completely correct, and taking measures to transfer cadres downward is absolutely necessary. Taking Chengdu's actual situation as an example, although a batch of cadres were transferred downward from municipal and district state organs and municipal enterprises from January to October last year, most of them returned to production posts and played an active role in production; however, considering the overall situation in Chengdu, the phenomenon of large institutions and excessive personnel still exists quite commonly and seriously, whether in government organs or enterprises and institutions. From the perspective of the government system, the phenomenon of inefficiency is relatively common; from the perspective of enterprises and institutions, the proportion of non-production personnel is also too large. The total average number of non-production personnel in 85 municipal factories accounts for 17.4 percent, which is obviously excessive. Not only that, but the vast majority of these non-production personnel are young intellectuals who have not undergone practical training in production labor or class struggle. These young intellectual cadres are generally enthusiastic and active and have played a certain role in their work, but because their bourgeois ideology has not been tested and tempered by actual struggle, they have not yet integrated with the worker-peasant masses, do not know the hardships of revolution and construction, and do not understand the thoughts and feelings of the worker-peasant masses. Therefore, not only are they unable to competently complete their tasks, but they generally cannot withstand the tests of major struggles, let alone real risks. During the period when bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, many of them once experienced political wavering, and some became prisoners of the rightists. These situations show that it is not only entirely necessary to transfer cadres downward to receive training in labor production, but it is indeed a matter of utmost urgency for our country's socialist revolution and construction. It is very wise of the central government to raise this issue in a timely manner.

　　The work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward is an important part of the current rectification and improvement. According to the guidelines and methods proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC regarding streamlining institutions and reducing non-production personnel, Chengdu began this work in late November and early December last year. The initial plan is to merge and reduce a total of 289 institutions in municipal, enterprise, and institutional organizations, reduce personnel by more than 30 percent from the municipal and district state establishment, and reduce non-production personnel by 35 to 65 percent from various enterprises and institutions, which can reduce approximately 13,000 people in total. The work of transferring cadres downward is being carried out in batches. Currently, a large number of cadres have been transferred to the labor front and grassroots units. The cadres transferred to rural areas have basically all arrived in rural areas by the end of January. The entire work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward will be fully completed by the end of April at the latest. The vast majority of the personnel reduced this time are being transferred to the labor front or grassroots units for training, and only a small number are retiring.

　　Many Benefits of Cadre Downward Transfer

　　It can improve efficiency, strengthen the connection between leaders and the masses; strengthen the labor front, turning consumer power into production power; and play a role in changing customs and habits by eradicating the social malady of despising physical labor.

　　Through the work of transferring cadres downward, we feel that there are many benefits to cadre downward transfer, and many long-standing problems can be solved through cadre downward transfer. Many organs and enterprises in Chengdu have large institutions and too many levels, which seriously affects the improvement of work efficiency and promotes the development of bureaucracy and subjectivism. This situation is also linked to the phenomenon of excessive personnel. After cadre downward transfer and personnel reduction, it will promote the streamlining of institutions and the reduction of levels, which will help improve work efficiency and improve work style, and help strengthen the close ties between leading organs and grassroots units and even the broad masses. Because a large number of transferred cadres directly participate in industrial and agricultural production or work in grassroots units, this strengthens the labor production front and strengthens the grassroots. Reducing non-production personnel and increasing direct production personnel turns consumer power into production power, which not only saves the country's manpower and financial resources, but also plays an active role in promoting our country's social productive forces, increasing social material wealth, and accelerating national construction. The leadership of many grassroots units in Chengdu was quite weak in the past. After this cadre downward transfer, the leadership of these units can be strengthened to a certain extent, which is conducive to promoting the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of cultural and educational work. As mentioned earlier, the vast majority of cadres in Chengdu are young intellectuals who have not undergone actual struggle training. They generally walked through the "three doors," that is, out of the home door, into the school door, and out of the school door, into the office door; they have not yet integrated with the worker-peasant masses, and have not yet established a proletarian standpoint and worldview. This cadre downward transfer is an excellent opportunity for them to receive training and transformation. This will give them the opportunity to participate in labor production that creates material wealth, learn in labor practice, establish correct labor views, have the opportunity to learn from the worker-peasant masses, establish close ties with the worker-peasant masses, and establish correct mass views; have the opportunity to participate in actual struggle, learn in the storms of mass struggle, and establish correct class views. As long as they earnestly study and comprehend Marxism-Leninism in actual struggle, and establish correct labor views, mass views, and class views, they will be able to undergo a transformation and become outstanding cadres with both ability and integrity needed by the Party and the country. Cadre downward transfer and direct participation in labor production play a role in changing customs and habits by eradicating the social malady of despising physical labor and physical laborers. The masses commented on this movement saying: "How could there be officials becoming farmers in history? Now cadres go to the countryside and the mountains to share weal and woe with the people. This movement is too great." Due to the influence of cadre downward transfer, the number of primary and secondary school graduates applying to go to the countryside has been increasing. According to incomplete statistics, from December last year to now, it has reached more than 2,000 people. Cadre downward transfer also has a profound impact on students in school. Many young students have written applications and resolutions to the school's Party branch, expressing their willingness to go to the "most difficult mountain areas and temper themselves in labor." Judging from the letters and visits from the people requesting employment, those requesting to go to the mountains and the countryside accounted for 30 percent in November last year. Since January this year, the number of people requesting to go to the mountains and the countryside has increased to 60 percent. Rural people who flowed into the cities, seeing cadres going to the countryside and the mountains, began to return to their hometowns to produce in large numbers. From November last year to now, more than 21,500 people have returned to their hometowns, accounting for about 27 percent of the rural population that has flowed into the cities since liberation. All of the above is enough to show that streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward is indeed a revolutionary measure with key importance. If this problem is solved well, many problems will be solved easily, and many other problems will also have the conditions for smooth resolution. It should also be pointed out that communism will eliminate the opposition between mental and physical labor, while capitalism deepens this opposition. Cadre downward transfer will greatly promote the combination of mental and physical labor, thereby creating conditions for completely eliminating the opposition between these two types of labor. It can be said that the revolutionary measure of cadre downward transfer is one of the fundamental measures for building socialism and communism in our country, and its enormous and far-reaching revolutionary significance will become increasingly apparent as time goes on.

　　Two Key Issues in Doing a Good Job in Organizing Downward Transfer: One is that leading cadres must make up their minds, and the other is to solve the problem of who to transfer, the arrangement of transferred personnel, and living subsidies according to the principle of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training."

　　Precisely because the work of transferring cadres downward is so important, it is very important to do a good job in organizing and ideologically preparing cadres for downward transfer. In the organizational work of cadre downward transfer, we have grasped two key issues, one is the leadership's determination and the other is the implementation of relevant downward transfer policies. We have learned that first of all, we must make leading cadres of various units truly understand the great political significance of transferring cadres downward. Only when they make up their minds can they resolutely implement the policy of streamlining institutions and reducing non-production personnel. In the beginning, the understanding of this policy by leading cadres of many units was not very clear. They mistakenly believed that more people are better for doing things, mistakenly believed that streamlining institutions and reducing non-production personnel would affect work efficiency, and mistakenly believed that leading cadres would reduce bureaucracy if they did less or no specific work. We thoroughly criticized these erroneous views and helped these comrades make up their minds, eliminate many worries, and abandon the procrastination style, which created favorable conditions for implementing the policy of cadre downward transfer. In implementing the relevant cadre downward transfer policies, we followed the principle of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training" and the spirit of being responsible for the transferred cadres. First, we focused on solving the problem of who to transfer. Those who should be transferred and can be transferred are resolutely mobilized to voluntarily apply for downward transfer. These people are mainly young intellectuals who have not undergone actual struggle training, and a small number are those who need to be transferred due to work needs even though they have undergone actual struggle training. Those who should be transferred but cannot or should not be transferred due to too many practical difficulties at present are generally left for later transfer. Secondly, there is the issue of arranging transferred personnel. In addition to a small number of cadres who need to retire, the initial plan is for about 60 percent of the transferred personnel to be transferred to rural areas in the Ya'an region to engage in agricultural production; in view of the fact that Chengdu needs to train a group of cadres familiar with industrial production as a reserve, about 30 percent are transferred to factories and mines to engage in industrial production; in order to strengthen grassroots units, especially cultural and educational grassroots and newly established joint public-private enterprises, about 10 percent are transferred to grassroots units in the city. Third, there is the issue of living subsidies for transferred personnel. We believe that personnel transferred to industrial and agricultural production should, in principle, be like workers and farmers, relying on their own labor income to maintain their lives, but in order to appropriately take care of the difficulties they may encounter in production and life in the initial stage of downward transfer, it is determined that: personnel transferred to rural areas will receive their original salary for the first year, and in the second and third years, subsidies will be given at the discretion of their performance and labor income. Personnel transferred to factories and mines will have their salaries assessed according to the new work post, and the difference between the lower salary and the original salary will be supplemented by the original unit for one year for cadres promoted before December 1955; cadres promoted after January 1, 1956 will have their salaries assessed according to the new work post; those who are transferred to apprentices will be treated according to the salary standard of old apprentices.

　　Ideological Work Mainly Relies on Great Debates

　　The vast majority of transferred cadres are in a happy mood and high spirits, clarifying many confused ideas and criticizing various erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie.

　　In the ideological work of cadre downward transfer, the main focus is to inspire the ideological consciousness of the vast number of transferred cadres, mobilize them to respond to the call of the Party and the country, and consciously apply for downward transfer, to go to the countryside, to go to the grassroots, to go to the labor front, to train themselves, and to build a new countryside. The main form of ideological education work is the great debate, and individual talks, small-scale seminars, and family visits are also used to understand and help transferred cadres with their ideological problems and specific difficulties. In the process of the debate, on the one hand, it can be seen that after the previous stage of the anti-rightist struggle, many intellectual cadres have begun to feel that they do need to be thoroughly transformed, and they have a high degree of awareness of responding to the Party and the country's policy of transferring cadres downward and transforming intellectuals; on the other hand, it also exposes that many people still have relatively serious misconceptions about the cadre downward transfer policy, about labor and the laboring people. They mistakenly believe that cadre downward transfer is "throwing away burdens," believe that intellectuals participating in labor production is "wasting talent" and "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut," believe that being a worker or a farmer has no future, believe that farmers are backward and dirty and there is nothing to learn from farmers, believe that intellectuals can be transformed without participating in physical labor or integrating with the worker-peasant masses, and so on. These erroneous arguments are essentially bourgeois individualistic ideas that despise physical labor and the laboring people, and are a manifestation of a lack of awareness that bourgeois intellectuals must be transformed into proletarian intellectuals. In response to this situation, we guided the vast number of cadres to conduct in-depth and thorough debates on the great revolutionary significance of the cadre downward transfer policy, the necessity and importance of intellectuals training and transforming themselves in labor, the necessity and importance of intellectuals integrating with the worker-peasant masses, the necessity and importance of building a cadre team that can withstand risks and strive for communism, and how to deal with difficulties. This debate generally lasted for three weeks. After this great debate, many confused ideas were clarified, various erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie were criticized, and a vivid and profound socialist education was conducted for the vast number of cadres. This made the vast majority of cadres have a correct understanding of the great political significance of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward, and felt that it was indeed necessary to go to production labor and to the worker-peasant masses to train and transform themselves; they realized that only by going to labor and to the worker-peasant masses can they truly transform themselves into proletarian intellectuals and train themselves into outstanding cadres who are both red and expert; they clarified that intellectuals participating in labor production is not without a future, but has a great future, and is not wasting talent, but is training talents. Many people said that they were "three-door" cadres in the past, and this time they want to enter the labor production "door" and train and transform themselves in labor production; some people said that they want to "transform themselves from timber into steel" by participating in labor production this time; many people said that they want to eat, live, and labor with the farmers, and want to learn the knowledge of class struggle and production struggle from the worker-peasant masses, and learn the habit of loving labor and the style of hard work and simplicity; some people said that they want to "strive to be an activist" in this labor training; and some people said that they want to use their "hands" and "hard work" to contribute to the "development of agriculture" in the motherland. Some family members said: "My children are Communist Party members. If Communist Party members don't go, who will go?" Some family members also made requests to their children, hoping that they would strive to be a model agricultural worker. On the basis of ideological debate, 90 percent of the cadres in the city applied to "go to the mountains and the countryside," many people asked to go to difficult mountain areas, many people asked to be transferred downward in the first batch, and many cadres' family members also encouraged and supported their loved ones to "go to the mountains and the countryside." Because the ideological work was done relatively thoroughly, the vast majority of transferred cadres are in a happy mood and high spirits. Only a small number of people are not firm enough in their attitude. Ideological education work is still being carried out for this group of people in order to help them clarify their thoughts and transform themselves earnestly and thoroughly.

　　After the Transferred Cadres Arrived in the Rural Areas

　　The vast majority performed well and received good reviews from the farmers; they expressed their willingness to learn from the working people and transform themselves; a few performed poorly and need long-term education.

　　Judging from the situation after the transferred cadres arrived in the rural areas of Ya'an, the vast majority performed well. They ate and lived with the farmers, and participated in labor production with the farmers on the second day. They carried and delivered fertilizer, built dikes, reclaimed wasteland, helped farmers with household chores such as fetching water, carrying firewood, and cooking, and helped farmers with cleaning and sanitation work, which received good reviews from the farmers. At present, transferred cadres generally do six to eight work points (ten work points are one work day) every day, and only a very few people do not reach five work points. Some transferred cadres used their expertise to help farmers do things, such as people who originally did accounting work helping cooperatives with bookkeeping and accounting; people who originally did health work helping farmers with medical treatment; and many cadres publicized policies to farmers and helped farmers learn culture. All of this made the farmers very moved. Some intellectuals who used to look down on the working people, now see that the peasant masses not only have a high enthusiasm for production and a simple and hard life, but also have a clear understanding of the enemy-friend boundaries and policy boundaries in their political understanding. In fact, they have shattered the erroneous view that farmers are backward, and now everyone has expressed their willingness to learn from the working people and transform themselves. Generally speaking, the vast majority of transferred cadres showed a spirit of hard work and simplicity, and expressed their willingness to integrate with the peasant masses and share weal and woe, so the peasant masses' comments were good. The peasant masses reflected: "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party lead well, so many cadres come down to work." And said: "Transferred cadres have no airs of cadres." On the other hand, a few people performed poorly after going down. They squandered wastefully, slept late, did not actively participate in labor production, made trouble to go home, and so on. For this kind of people, in the future, we must strengthen education more long-term in labor.

　　The work of transferring cadres downward in Chengdu is still ongoing. In order to resolutely implement the policy of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward, and to do a good job in the downward transfer, we must continue to pay attention to conducting serious struggles against conservative ideas and parochialism that do not proceed from the overall situation, as well as various manifestations of individualism, and continue to prevent irresponsible and hasty phenomena. At the same time, for the cadres who have already been transferred downward, the original units should establish regular contact with them, pay attention to giving them necessary education and assistance politically, care about their production, study and life, and help them solve the difficulties that can be solved, so that these cadres can truly be trained on the labor front and in actual struggle to become staunch fighters who wholeheartedly strive for communism.

专栏：

　　干部应该锻炼得又红又专
    李宗林代表介绍成都市干部下放工作
    我完全同意李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”、彭真副委员长“关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”和吴玉章主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告”。
    现在我就成都市下放干部问题向大会作一简要汇报：
    整改工作中重要一环
    政府系统，有的人浮于事；企业单位，非生产人员比例过大。一些青年知识分子经不起风浪的考验。所以干部下放不仅必要，而且是当务之急。
    成都市机关的整风运动，目前正处在整改阶段。这一阶段的主要工作内容之一是紧缩机构，下放干部。紧缩机构，下放干部是我国当前社会主义革命的建设工作中一项重大的革命措施，毛主席早在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中就已指出了它的重大的政治意义。邓小平同志在中共八届三中全会上所作的“关于整风运动的报告”中，又详细地说明了紧缩机构，减少脱产人员，对于国家建设事业的重大意义。我们认为，中央这些指示都是完全正确的，采取下放干部的措施是完全必要的。以成都市的实际情况来说，虽然在去年一至十月份陆续从市、区国家机关和市属企业单位中下放了一批干部，其中大部分人回到了生产岗位，并在生产中起了积极作用；但就成都市的整个情况来看，无论在政府机关，或企业、事业单位，机构庞大、人员过多的现象，仍然是较普遍较严重地存在着。从政府系统来看，人浮于事的现象较为普遍；从企业和事业单位来看，非生产人员的比例也过大，市属八十五个工厂非生产人员的总平均数占百分之十七点四，显然是过多了。不仅如此，而且在这些脱产人员中，绝大部分是没有经过生产劳动或阶级斗争实际锻炼的青年知识分子。这些青年知识分子干部，一般热情、积极，在工作中起了一定的作用，但由于他们具有资产阶级思想没有经受过实际斗争的锻炼和考验，还没有和工农群众相结合，不知道革命和建设的艰难困苦，不了解工农群众的思想感情，因而不仅不能胜任地完成自己的任务，而且一般经不起较大斗争风浪的考验，更不要说真正的风险了。在资产阶级右派分子向党、向社会主义猖狂进攻期间，他们中的不少人就一度发生了政治动摇，有的成了右派分子的俘虏。这些情况说明，下放干部使他们在劳动生产中得到锻炼，不仅是完全必要的，而且的确是我国社会主义革命和建设工作的一项当务之急，中央及时提出这个问题是非常英明的。
    紧缩机构、下放干部的工作是当前整改中重要的一环。根据中共八届三中全会提出的关于紧缩机构，减少脱产人员的方针和办法，成都市在去年十一月底十二月初即开始了这项工作，初步计划全市机关、企业、事业机构共计划归并和减少二百八十九个，从市、区国家编制中减少人员百分之三十以上，从各企业、事业单位中减少脱产人员百分之三十五至六十五，共可减少一万三千人左右。下放干部的工作是分批进行的，目前大批干部已陆续下放到劳动战线和基层单位去，下放农村的干部，业已在一月底基本上全部到达农村，整个紧缩机构、下放干部工作最迟在四月底即可全部完成。这次减少的人员，绝大多数是下放到劳动战线或基层单位去锻炼的，只有少数人是属于退职退休的。
    干部下放的好处很多
    能提高效率，密切领导和群众的联系；加强了劳动战线，把消费力量变成生产力量；对于社会上鄙视体力劳动的恶习起了移风易俗的作用。
    通过下放干部的工作，我们感到干部下放的好处很多，通过下放干部可以解决许多长期不能解决的问题。成都市的许多机关、企业单位，由于机构庞大，层次太多，严重地影响了工作效率的提高，助长了官僚主义和主观主义的发展。这种状况，又是和人员过多的现象相联系的。干部下放，人员减少之后，就会促进机构的紧缩和层次的减少，有助于工作效率的提高和工作作风的改进，有助于加强领导机关和基层单位以至广大群众之间的密切联系。由于大批下放干部直接参加了工农业生产或到基层单位工作，这就加强了劳动生产战线，加强了基层。非生产人员减少，直接生产的人员增加，把消费的力量变成了生产的力量，这不仅节约了国家的人力财力，而且对于促进我国的社会生产力，增加社会物质财富，加速国家建设，都将起积极的作用。成都市的许多基层单位，过去的领导是相当薄弱的，这次干部下放后，这些单位的领导都可得到一定程度的加强，有利于促进工、农业生产高潮和文化教育工作的改进。如前所说，成都市的干部，绝大多数是未经过实际斗争锻炼的青年知识分子，他们一般是走了“三门”，即出了家门，进了校门，出了校门，进了机关门；他们还没有和工农群众相结合，还没有确立无产阶级的立场和世界观。这次干部下放，是使他们获得锻炼和改造的一个极好的机会。这将使他们有机会参加创造物质财富的劳动生产，在劳动实践中学习，树立正确的劳动观点，有机会向工农群众学习，同工农群众建立密切的联系，树立正确的群众观点；有机会参加实际斗争，在群众斗争的风浪中学习，树立正确的阶级观点。只要他们在实际斗争中认真学习和领会马克思列宁主义，树立了正确的劳动观点、群众观点、阶级观点，他们就有可能获得脱胎换骨的改造，成为党和国家所需要的德才兼备的优秀干部。干部下放，直接参加劳动生产，对于社会上鄙视体力劳动、体力劳动者的恶习，起了移风易俗的作用。群众对这个运动评价说：“历史上那有当官的去当农民，现在干部下乡上山和人民群众同甘共苦，这个运动太伟大了”。由于干部下放的影响，现在申请到农村的中小学毕业生已日益增多，据不完全的统计，从去年十二月份到现在，已达二千余人。对于在校学生，干部下放也有深刻的影响，不少青年学生向学校党支部写申请书、决心书，表示愿到“最艰苦的山区去，在劳动中千锤百炼，改造自己”。从人民来信、来访要求就业的情况看，去年十一月份要求上山下乡者占百分之三十，今年一月份以来，要求上山下乡的人数已增至百分之六十。流入城市的农村人口，看到干部下乡上山，开始大批返乡生产，从去年十一月到现在，返乡者已达两万一千五百余人，约占解放几年来流入城市的农村人口的百分之二十七。上述种种，都足以说明紧缩机构下放干部的确是一个带有关键性的革命措施，这个问题解决得好，许多问题就将迎刃而解，而另外许多问题也将因此而获得顺利解决的条件。还应当指出，共产主义将消除脑力劳动和体力劳动间的对立，而资本主义则加深这种对立，干部下放将大大促进脑力和体力两种劳动的结合，从而为完全消除这两种劳动间的对立创造条件。可以说，干部下放这一个革命措施，是在我国建设社会主义和共产主义的根本性的措施之一，随着时间的推移，它的巨大而深远的革命意义也将日益明显地表现出来。
    做好下放的组织工作两个关键性问题：一个是领导干部要下决心，一个是根据“统一安排，全面锻炼”方针，解决下放什么人、下放人员的安排和生活补助等问题。
    正因为下放干部工作是如此的重要，所以，做好干部下放的组织工作和思想工作就十分要紧。在干部下放的组织工作中，我们抓住了两个关键问题，一个是领导决心问题，一个是贯彻执行有关下放政策的问题。我们体会到，首先要使各单位领导干部真正懂得下放干部的重大政治意义，下了决心，才能坚决贯彻执行紧缩机构，减少脱产人员的方针。在开始时不少单位的领导干部对这个方针的认识是不很明确的。他们误认为人多好办事，误认为紧缩机构，减少脱产人员会影响工作的效率，误认为领导干部不做或少做具体工作就会减少官僚主义。对这些错误观点，我们进行了彻底的批判，帮助这些同志下了决心，消除了许多忧虑，抛弃了拖泥带水的作风，就为贯彻执行干部下放方针造成了有利条件。在贯彻执行有关干部下放的政策中，我们根据“统一安排，全面锻炼”的方针，和对下放干部负责的精神，首先抓住下放什么人的问题予以解决。凡属应该下放而又可能下放者，坚决动员其自觉申请下放，这部分人主要是未经过实际斗争锻炼的青年知识分子，也有少数是虽经过实际斗争锻炼但工作需要下放的；凡属虽应下放但因目前实际困难太多因而不能或不宜下放者，则一般留待以后下放。其次，是下放人员的安排问题，除少数干部需要退职退休外，初步计划下放到雅安专区农村从事农业生产者约占下放人员的百分之六十；鉴于成都市需要培养一批熟悉工业生产的干部后备，下放到厂矿从事工业生产者约百分之三十；为了加强基层单位特别是文教基层和新公私合营企业的领导，下放到本市基层单位者约百分之十。第三是下放人员的生活补助问题，我们认为，下放到工农业生产中的人员，原则应和工人农民一样，依靠自己的劳动收入来维持自己的生活，但为了适当照顾他们在下放初期在生产和生活上可能发生的困难，确定：凡下放到农村的人员，第一年原工资照发，第二年、第三年根据本人的表现和劳动收入的情况，酌情予以补助。凡下放到厂矿的人员，一九五五年十二月以前提拔起来的干部，下放后的工资按新工作岗位评定，低于原工资的差额由原在单位补发一年；一九五六年一月一日以后提拔起来的干部一律按新的工作岗位评定工资；下放当学徒者按老学徒的工资标准待遇。
    思想工作主要依靠大辩论
    绝大多数下放干部都是心情舒畅，精神愉快，澄清了许多糊涂观念，批判了资产阶级的各种错误思想。
    在下放干部的思想工作中，主要是启发广大下放干部的思想自觉，动员他们响应党和国家的号召，自觉地申请下放，到农村去，到基层去，到劳动战线上去，锻炼自己，建设新农村。思想教育工作的主要形式是大辩论，同时又采取了个别谈心、小型座谈、家庭访问等方式，了解和帮助下放干部的思想问题和具体困难。在辩论的过程中，一方面看出经过前一阶段的反右斗争，许多知识分子干部已开始感觉到自己确有彻底改造的必要，他们对于响应党和国家下放干部、改造知识分子的政策有较高的自觉；另一方面，也暴露出不少人对干部下放政策、对劳动和劳动人民，仍然存在着比较严重的错误认识。他们错误地认为下放干部是“丢包袱”，认为知识分子参加劳动生产是“浪费人才”、“大材小用”，认为当工人、农民没有前途，认为农民落后、农民脏、向农民没有学头，认为知识分子不参加体力劳动、不和工农群众结合也可得到改造等等。这些错误论调，实质上是轻视体力劳动轻视劳动人民的资产阶级个人主义思想，是对资产阶级知识分子必须改造成为无产阶级知识分子缺乏自觉的一种表现。针对这种情况，我们引导广大干部，对干部下放政策的巨大革命意义、知识分子到劳动中锻炼改造的必要性和重要性、知识分子一定要和工农群众相结合的必要性和重要性、建立为共产主义奋斗的经得起风险的干部队伍的必要性和重要性、以及如何对待困难等问题，进行了深入透彻的辩论。这场辩论一般都进行了三个星期。经过这场大辩论，澄清了许多糊涂观念，批判了资产阶级的各种错误思想，对广大干部进行了一次生动、深刻的社会主义教育。使绝大多数干部都对紧缩机构下放干部的重大政治意义有了正确的认识，感觉到确有必要到生产劳动中，到工农群众中，去锻炼和改造自己；他们认识到只有到劳动中去、到工农群众中去，才能把自己真正改造成为无产阶级知识分子，锻炼成为又红又专的优秀干部；他们明确了知识分子参加劳动生产不是没有前途，而是大有前途，不是浪费人才，正是锻炼人材。许多人表示，自己过去是“三门”干部，这次要进劳动生产“门”，在劳动生产中锻炼改造自己；有的人说，这次参加劳动生产，要将自己“由木材锻炼成钢材”；许多人表示，要与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，要向工农群众学习阶级斗争和生产斗争的知识，学习热爱劳动的习惯和艰苦朴素的作风；有的人表示，要在这次劳动锻炼中，“争取当一个积极分子”；还有的人表示，要用自己的“双手”和“辛勤劳动”，为祖国“农业的发展贡献一分力量”。有的家属说：“我的儿女是共产党员，如果共产党员都不去，那个还去呢？”还有的家属向自己的儿女提出希望，希望他们争取当一个农业劳动模范。在思想辩论的基础上，全市百分之九十的干部申请“上山下乡”，许多人要求到艰苦的山区去，许多人要求首批下放，许多干部的家属也鼓励和支持自己的亲人“上山下乡”。由于思想工作做得比较深透，绝大多数下放干部都是心情舒畅、精神愉快的。只有少数人的态度不够坚决。对这部分人还在继续进行思想教育工作，以便帮助他们把思想弄通，认真地彻底地改造自己。
    下放干部到农村以后
    绝大多数表现的好，获得农民的好评；表示愿向劳动人民学习，改造自己；个别的表现不好，需要长期加以教育。
    从下放干部到达雅安农村后的情况看，绝大多数人的表现是好的。他们和农民同吃、同住，第二天便同农民一道参加了劳动生产。他们背送肥料，修筑堰塘，开垦荒地，帮助农民进行挑水、背柴、煮饭等家务劳动，并帮助农民进行清洁卫生工作，获得了农民的好评。现在下放干部一般每天都做到了六至八个工分（十个工分为一个劳动日），少数人已做到十至十三个工分，做不到五个工分的人仅占极少数。有的下放干部发挥自己的专长，帮助农民做事，如原来做会计工作的人帮助合作社记账、算账；原来做卫生工作的人帮助农民看病；许多干部向农民宣传政策，帮助农民学习文化。这一切，都使农民十分感动。过去有些看不起劳动人民的知识分子，现在看到农民群众不但生产热情很高，生活朴素艰苦，而且在政治认识上敌我界限、政策界限都很明确，事实上已经粉碎了那种认为农民落后的错误看法，现在大家都表示愿意向劳动人民学习，改造自己。总的说来，绝大多数下放干部都表现了艰苦朴素的精神，表示愿意同农民群众打成一片，同甘共苦，因而农民群众的评论是良好的。农民群众反映：“毛主席、共产党领导的好，这样多干部下来劳动。”并且说：“下放干部没有干部架子。”另一方面，有个别的人下去之后表现不好，他们挥霍浪费，睡懒觉，不积极参加劳动生产，闹回家等等，对这一种人，今后在劳动中须更长期的加强教育。
    成都市下放干部的工作现在还在继续进行。为了坚决贯彻执行紧缩机构、下放干部的方针政策，做好下放工作，还必须继续注意同保守思想和不从全局出发的本位主义思想以及各色各样的个人主义表现作严肃的斗争，继续防止不负责任和草率从事的现象。同时，对于已经下放的干部，原在单位要与他们建立经常的联系，注意从政治上给他们以必要的教育和帮助，关心他们的生产、学习和生活，并帮助他们解决可能解决的困难，使这批干部真正能够在劳动战线上、在实际斗争中，锻炼成全心全意为共产主义奋斗的坚强战士。
    以上发言，如有不当之处，请批评指正。
