Notes

    No Benefit
    U.S. Army Secretary Brucker publicly stated on the 12th that the United States would not gain any benefit from a summit meeting with the Soviet Union.
    This kind of argument is, of course, quite startling, but from another perspective, it is not entirely without reason. It depends on what kind of benefit the United States wants to obtain. If certain ruling groups in the United States conceive of peace as a disaster, or if they harbor the intention of seeking advantages at the expense of others, then a summit meeting is indeed harmful and unhelpful to them.
    However, people like Brucker do not understand that in today's situation where the people of all countries strongly demand a summit meeting, if the U.S. ruling groups refuse or delay the convening of the meeting, then it will probably be even less beneficial to them.

### 没有好处

    没有好处
    美国陆军部长布鲁克12日公开说：在和苏联举行的最高级会议上美国得不到什么好处。
    这种论调当然是十分可惊的，但是从另一方面来说，也并非全无道理。这要看美国想得到的是什么样的好处。如果美国某些统治集团从他们视和平如灾祸的立场来设想，或者是抱着从旁人身上讨便宜的打算，那末最高级会议对他们确是有害无益的。
    但是布鲁克之流没有明白，在今天各国人民强烈要求举行最高级会议的形势之下，美国统治集团要是拒绝或阻延会议的召开，那末恐怕对他们更没有好处。
