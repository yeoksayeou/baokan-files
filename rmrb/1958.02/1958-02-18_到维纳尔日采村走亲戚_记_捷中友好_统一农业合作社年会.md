Visiting Relatives in the Village of Vinarice
—A Record of the Annual Meeting of the "Czech-Chinese Friendship" United Agricultural Cooperative
By Our Correspondent Yang Yi

On the morning of February 4th, I accompanied Ambassador Cao Ying of our embassy in Czechoslovakia and other embassy comrades on a "relative-visiting" trip—to the "Czech-Chinese Friendship" United Agricultural Cooperative in the village of Vinarice, at their invitation to attend their annual meeting.

The annual meeting is a meaningful gathering method for agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia, essentially a meeting of cooperative members, generally held in January and February, taking advantage of the slack farming season before the start of spring plowing. At the meeting, the previous year's work is reported and discussed, and the production plan for the current year is adopted.

For the people of our country, the village of Vinarice is not an unfamiliar name. This April will mark the fifth anniversary of the establishment of friendly ties between it and the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangguozhuang, Beijing. Over the past five years, the village of Vinarice has seen countless footprints of Chinese guests and has taken away immeasurable deep feelings of the working people of Czechoslovakia. I had an unforgettable visit in the early summer of 1954, and now I am making a second visit with equally excited feelings during the traditional Chinese season of "Beginning of Spring."

The seventy-kilometer journey was quickly completed, and the car stopped in a small clearing on a high slope. The hosts warmly welcomed us into the cooperative's club, where the annual meeting was to be held. In the center of the room hung a portrait of Chairman Mao, flanked by tapestries and traditional Chinese paintings, and decorated with Chinese utensils, books, and toys. Each item here could tell you a vivid story, all containing the deep friendship of the Chinese people. The hall was filled with long tables, and when we entered, the tables were already full of people, who all stood up and applauded warmly. Some of us were old acquaintances and shook hands warmly, greeting each other.

I noticed that among the people attending the meeting, besides the cooperative members, there were many "guests." Among them were representatives of the local garrison, who had a contract with the cooperative to help with labor during the busy farming season; experts from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences who regularly assisted the cooperative; the deputy head of the county people's committee and the chairman of the township people's committee; and the head of the machine tractor station and representatives from neighboring village cooperatives. From the participants in the annual meeting, it could be seen that everyone had formed a harmonious collective for the rapid development of socialist agriculture.

The format of the meeting was lively, and the reports and speeches were quite brief and specific. Comrade Herman, the old chairman, pointed out in his report that the yields of major crops had increased last year, and the income of cooperative members had also improved. Now, each member can earn an average of five to six hundred workdays a year, with a cash reward of twenty-three crowns per workday, plus a physical reward of two kilograms of grain.

The chairman's report and the members' speeches also frankly pointed out some difficulties and shortcomings in the work. What was worrying was the lack of manpower. Currently, the cooperative only has more than thirty member households, with a total labor force of just over fifty people, and very few young and middle-aged people. The average age of the members has reached over fifty years old. There are only three agricultural households in the entire village who have not joined the cooperative, and there is not much potential to be tapped. To manage nearly four thousand mu of land and raise more than four hundred head of livestock, this amount of manpower would naturally feel strained. The chairman of the cooperative often said with emotion, "If we had more people, we could produce even more." The members put forward some solutions to the shortage of labor, such as attracting young people to participate in agricultural production, making better use of agricultural machinery, improving the degree of mechanization, and improving the organization and command of production. At the meeting, members also actively signed up for voluntary labor for the cooperative; when the army representative proposed to volunteer two hundred hours of labor for the cooperative, the agricultural expert also stood up and guaranteed to do fifty hours of voluntary labor for the cooperative, and the whole audience burst into warm applause.

Strengthening the members' love for the cooperative and cultivating the concept of "loving the cooperative like home" was also a central topic at this annual meeting. The area where the village of Vinarice is located is mainly engaged in industrial production. Nearby is the world-famous Skoda car factory. Four-fifths of the population of the entire village is engaged in industrial labor, and people in the cooperative members' families also participate in industrial production, and most of them are "men working in factories and women farming." Agricultural income is not the only income of the members' families, which cannot but affect the members' concern for the public affairs of the cooperative, and the members also have a not-so-small private plot to worry about. But despite this, the superiority of collectivization and the Czech Communist Party's attention to socialist ideological education have gradually made the farmers clear about their future. The enthusiastic speeches of the members at the meeting showed that the relationship between the members and the cooperative has improved, and this is the best guarantee for agricultural production.

While seriously discussing the problems in the work, the attentive hosts did not neglect the feelings of the Chinese people and Chinese guests in the slightest. Comrade Hanzlik, a member who had recently returned from a trip to China, enthusiastically told Ambassador Cao Ying about his impressions of New China. Comrade Herman, the chairman of the cooperative, repeatedly invited the member brothers of Zhangguozhuang to visit, and they had even prepared living rooms for the members of Zhangguozhuang. Comrade Herman himself also said that he would come to China to visit whenever he had the opportunity, and hoped to stay in Zhangguozhuang for a longer period of time to learn from the production and management experience of Chinese farmers. The meeting and the meal were held at the same time, and basins of sweets and dishes were constantly brought to the table. We all ate too much, but the hosts still kindly persuaded us to eat more. Laughter shook the whole venue, and the performances and music of the young soldiers added to the atmosphere of joy. A group of innocent and lively children also ran through the crowd, looking for Chinese guests to write inscriptions on their cherished notebooks as souvenirs. The embassy comrades brought several Chinese films "Premier Siroky Visits China," "Famous Scenic Spots in Beijing," and "Chrysanthemum." After these short films were shown, the hosts praised them endlessly, and some even asked to send them some flower seeds.

The annual meeting started at ten o'clock in the morning and had not ended by nine o'clock in the evening. We had to say goodbye because we had to rush back to the city. Before leaving, the chairman of the cooperative repeatedly urged us to send more people to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the establishment of friendship between them and the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangguozhuang.

    到维纳尔日采村走亲戚
    ——记“捷中友好”统一农业合作社年会
    本报记者　杨翊
    2月4日清晨，记者随同我国驻捷使馆曹瑛大使和使馆其他同志动身去“走亲戚”——前往维纳尔日采村“捷中友好”统一农业合作社，应邀参加他们一年一度的年会。
    年会是捷克斯洛伐克农业合作社的一种饶有意义的集会方式，实际上就是社员大会，一般在每年1、2月份利用春耕开始前的农闲时期举行。会上要报告和讨论头年工作，并通过当年的生产计划。
    对于我国人民来说，维纳尔日采村不是一个陌生的名字，今年4月将是它和我国北京张郭庄中捷友谊农业生产合作社建立友好联系的五周年。五年来，维纳尔日采村已数不清留下了多少中国客人的足迹，也无法计算带走了多少捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的深情厚意。记者曾在1954年初夏有过一次难忘的访问，现在又以同样激动的心情在我国传统的“立春”季节去作第二次的会见。
    七十公里的路程很快就走完了，汽车在一个高坡上的小场地停了下来，主人们热情地把我们迎进合作社的俱乐部，年会就在这儿举行。屋子正中挂着毛主席像，两旁还悬挂着织锦和国画，摆设着中国的器皿、书籍和玩具，这里每件东西都可告诉你一篇生动的故事，都包含着中国人民的深挚情谊。会场内摆了许多长桌，当我们进去时，桌旁已坐满了人，大家都站起来热烈鼓掌。我们中一些人和他们已是老相识了，彼此亲切握手，互相问候、招呼。
    我发现出席会议的人群中，除合作社社员外，还有许多“客人”。这里面有当地驻军代表，他们和合作社订有合同，在农忙时来帮助社里劳动；有常年协助合作社工作的农业科学院的专家；有县人民委员会的副县长和乡人民委员会的主席，还有机器拖拉机站的站长和邻村合作社的代表。从年会的参加者可以看出，为了社会主义农业的飞速发展，大家组成了一个和谐的集体。
    会议的形式是生动活泼的，报告和发言都相当简短而具体。老主席赫尔曼同志在报告中指出，去年主要农作物都增了产，社员收入也有所提高。现在每个社员平均一年可挣得五百到六百个劳动日，每个劳动日的现金报酬为二十三克朗，另外还有两公斤粮食的实物报酬。
    主席的报告和社员的发言中也坦率地指出了工作中的一些困难和缺点。使人焦心的是人力的缺乏，现在合作社只有三十多户社员，全部劳动力不过五十多人，而且青壮年很少，社员平均年龄已达五十多岁。全村未入社的农业人口只不过三户，能挖掘的潜力并不多。要经营近四千亩土地和饲养四百多头牲畜，这点人力自然会感到吃紧。社主席不时感慨地说：“如果人再多些，我们就能生产得更多。”社员们提出了一些解决劳动力不足的办法，如吸收青年参加农业生产，更好地利用农业机器，提高机械化的程度，改进生产的组织和指挥等。在会上，社员们也踊跃报名为合作社义务劳动；当军队代表提出为合作社义务劳动二百小时，农业专家也站起来保证给社里做五十小时的义务劳动时，全场当时响起了热烈的掌声。
    加强社员们对合作社的热爱，培养“爱社如家”的观念也是这次年会上的一个中心话题。维纳尔日采村所在的地区是以工业生产为主的，附近有世界驰名的斯科达汽车工厂，全村五分之四的人口从事工业劳动，社员家庭中也都有人参加工业生产，而且多是“男工女耕”，农业收入并不是社员家庭的唯一收入，这种情况不能不影响社员对社的公共事业的关心，而且社员还都有一块不算小的自留地得操心。但尽管如此，合作化的优越性和捷共对社会主义思想教育工作的注意，已逐步使农民们明确了自己的前途，社员们在会上的热烈发言，显示出社员与社的关系有了改进，而这也就是农业增产的最好保证。
    在严肃讨论工作中问题的同时，殷勤的主人也并未稍许疏忽对中国人民和中国客人的情意。新近自中国旅行归来的社员汉兹里克同志兴致勃勃地向曹瑛大使讲述他对新中国的观感。社主席赫尔曼同志一再邀请张郭庄的社员兄弟去访问，他们甚至已为张郭庄的社员准备好了住室。赫尔曼同志本人也表示一有机会就要来中国参观，并希望能在张郭庄多住一个时期，学习中国农民的生产和管理经验。会议和会餐在同时进行，一盆盆的甜食和一道道的菜肴不断地送上桌来。我们都吃得太饱了，而主人们仍好意地劝让着，要我们再多吃些。笑语声震荡着全场，部队小伙子们的表演和演奏更增添了人们的欢乐气氛。一群天真活泼的小朋友也在人丛中穿来插去，寻找中国的客人在他们珍爱的本子上题字留念。使馆同志带去了几部中国影片“西罗基总理访华”、“北京名胜”和“菊花”，这几部短片放映后，主人们赞赏不绝，有人还要求为他们寄去一些花籽。
    年会从早上十时开始，到晚上九时多还未结束，我们由于要赶回城内，不得不先告辞了。临别前，社主席还叮咛要多去些人参加他们与张郭庄中捷友谊农业生产合作社建立友谊五周年的庆祝会。
