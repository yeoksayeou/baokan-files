　　Student Grants Must Be Used Properly
　　Zhongsheng
    In order to foster the growth of the younger generation and enable students from families with financial difficulties, especially children from working-class families of workers and peasants, to study in higher education institutions, the state has established the People's Grant system. This system specifically embodies the principle of opening higher education to workers and peasants and has played a significant role in ensuring the development of higher education in our country and cultivating a large number of construction talents.

    Recently, many higher education institutions have revealed the phenomenon of some students arbitrarily wasting People's Grants. Some students use their grants to eat and drink extravagantly in restaurants, while others use them to buy leather shoes, get perms, smoke expensive cigarettes, and go to the theater. Some students send their People's Grants home, and others apply for cotton clothing subsidies even though they already have cotton clothing. Some children of industrialists and merchants who enjoy grant benefits even say, "My family's factories and enterprises are now under joint state-private ownership, so the state should be responsible for my university education."

    This situation does not meet the requirements of the state's establishment of the People's Grant system and is completely incompatible with the spirit of building the country and running schools diligently and thriftily. Our country is currently undertaking socialist construction on an unprecedented scale, and the people of the whole country are economizing on food and clothing to accumulate funds for socialist construction. Student grants are the fruits of the people's labor, how can they be wasted!

    The reason for the phenomenon of wasting student grants is mainly due to the fact that some students have the bourgeois ideology of pursuing personal enjoyment and lack the experience of hardship and simplicity. They have never thought that every bit they squander is the wealth created by the working people and should be cherished. On the other hand, there is bureaucracy in the management of student grants in schools, the approval process is not strictly controlled, and the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily and working while studying is not implemented. This also fosters the students' idea of relying entirely on the state and is a reason why they can arbitrarily waste state funds. In the past, schools did not do enough ideological education work for students when evaluating student grants.

    In order to ensure that student grants are used properly, it is necessary for higher education institutions to correctly handle the work of issuing People's Grants. Many schools have universally mobilized students to conduct special debates on this issue, allowing students to fully express their opinions and debate extensively. Through this expression and debate, students are given an ideological education on running schools diligently and thriftily and working while studying, and they overcome the wrong ideas that exist on this issue. This practice is worth promoting.

    In order to correctly exert the role of the People's Grant and prevent the phenomenon of wasting People's Grants, when adjusting the People's Grant, school leaders should strengthen the specific leadership of this work, carry out ideological education on hard work, simplicity, and working while studying for students, change the bureaucratic attitude in the past management of student grants, and overcome the shortcomings of not being serious enough in reviewing students' economic conditions, not thoroughly implementing the class line, controlling the subsidy scope of student grants too wide, and setting the subsidy conditions too low. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent over-strict handling and the phenomenon that some students who do have family difficulties do not dare to apply for student grants or that student grants are not approved.

    Student grants are a considerable amount of state funds. Schools should be responsible to the 600 million people and use this fund properly. It is necessary to both enable many students with family financial difficulties to study with peace of mind and train more talents for socialist construction for the country; and to not waste and cultivate college students who are hardworking, frugal, and have communist ideology and moral character for the country.

　　助学金要使用得当
　　众生
    国家为了青年一代的成长，使许多家庭经济困难的学生，特别是工农劳动人民家庭出身的子女能入高等学校学习，设立了人民助学金制度。这种制度具体体现了高等学校向工农开门的方针，对保证我国高等教育事业的发展，培养大批建设人才，起了重大作用。
    最近许多高等学校揭发出不少学生任意浪费人民助学金的现象。有的学生领来助学金就去上馆子大吃大喝，有的学生拿助学金买皮鞋、烫头发、抽高级香烟、看戏，有的学生领来人民助学金往家里寄，有的学生有了棉衣还申请棉衣补助费。有些享受助学金待遇的工商业资本家的子弟，甚至说，现在“我家工厂企业已经公私合营了，国家应该负责我上大学。”
    这种情况，不符合国家设置人民助学金的要求，同勤俭建国、勤俭办学的精神也是完全不相称的。我国正在进行空前规模的社会主义建设，全国人民都在节衣缩食，积累资金，建设社会主义。助学金是人民劳动的果实，岂容浪费！
    产生浪费助学金现象的原因，主要是由于一部分学生存在资产阶级追求个人享受的思想，缺乏艰苦朴素的锻炼，他们从没有想到过他们挥霍的一点一滴，都是劳动人民创造的财富，应该万分珍惜。另一方面，学校对助学金的管理工作上存在着官僚主义，批准过程掌握不严，没有贯彻勤俭建国、勤工俭学的方针，也是助长学生一切依靠国家包下来的思想和所以能够随意浪费国家资财的一个原因。过去学校在进行助学金的评定工作时，对学生的思想教育工作也做得不够。
    为了把助学金使用得当，高等学校都有必要正确地对待发给人民助学金的工作。有很多学校普遍发动学生对这个问题进行专题辩论，让广大学生在这个问题上大鸣大放，大争大辩。通过这一鸣放和争辩，对学生进行一次勤俭办学、勤工俭学的思想教育，克服学生在这个问题上存在的错误思想。这种作法是值得推广的。
    为了能够正确发挥人民助学金的作用，防止人民助学金的浪费现象，在调整人民助学金的时候，学校领导方面应该加强对这项工作的具体领导，对学生进行艰苦朴素、勤工俭学的思想教育工作，改变过去在管理助学金工作上的官僚主义态度，并且要克服过去审查学生的经济情况不够认真，贯彻阶级路线不够，掌握助学金的补助面太宽，以及补助条件订得过低等缺点。但同时也应该防止处理过严，发生某些家庭确有困难的学生也不敢申请助学金、或不批准助学金的现象。
    助学金是国家一笔数目不小的资金。学校应该对六亿人民负责，把这一笔资金用之得当。要作到既能使许多家庭经济有困难的学生安心求学，给国家培养更多的社会主义建设人才；又能不浪费，为国家培养出刻苦耐劳、勤俭朴素、具有共产主义思想和道德品质的大学生。
