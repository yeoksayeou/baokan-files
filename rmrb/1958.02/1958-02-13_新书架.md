    “Red Flag Genealogy”
    Liang Bin's novel "Red Flag Genealogy" is a good work. It depicts the class struggle in the rural areas on both sides of the Hutuo River before and after the Great Revolution through the changes in the Zhu Lao Zhong and Yan Zhihe families, three generations of farmers, and the history of the landlord Feng Lao Lan; and through the profound and broad impact of the "April 12th" coup on the people of central Hebei, it depicts the anti-head tax movement launched under the leadership of the Party and the student movement in Baoding Second Normal School for the sake of resisting Japan.
    The author, with simple brushstrokes, shapes the heroic images of Zhu Lao Zhong and Yan Zhihe's three generations, vividly portraying the different experiences of the three generations in different eras, and depicting how Yan Jiangtao and Zhang Jiaqing, two young people from different class backgrounds, became strong revolutionary fighters after being tempered by the flames of struggle under the leadership of the Party. The book is full of revolutionary optimism and a relatively strong atmosphere of life, and the descriptions of revolutionary struggle scenes are exciting.
    “Red Sun”
    In addition to Du Pengcheng's "Defend Yan'an," which was published in the past, Wu Qiang's "Red Sun" has recently been published, reflecting the Third Revolutionary Civil War.
    The story of "Red Sun" revolves around the famous Laiwu and Menglianggu battles on the East China battlefield. Shen Zhenxin, the army commander of a certain People's Liberation Army army, is the central figure running through the entire work. He is an old cadre from a poor peasant background who has gone through the Long March, is infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause, and is extremely caring for his subordinates. Although he appears somewhat irritable on the surface, his inner feelings are actually very rich and profound. The author portrays the image of this senior commander relatively vividly. At the same time, the author also writes about the different personalities of Deputy Army Commander Liang Bo, Regiment Commander Liu Changsheng, and soldiers Qin Shouben, Zhang Huafeng, and other different types of characters. Through the portrayal of these characters and the analysis of their noble inner feelings, the work reflects the heroic spirit and invincible power of our people's army, and also allows readers to more comprehensively understand the rich content of military life, so as to realize and understand where the infinite combat power of the People's Liberation Army comes from.
    “The Grandmother”
    Němcová was the greatest Czech realist writer of the 19th century and the founder of modern Czech prose literature. She devoted her life to the struggle for national liberation and women's freedom, and her literary works are actually a part of her fighting life. "The Grandmother," written in her later years, is a world-famous novel. It is based on the author's childhood memories of her grandmother, but it is not a biography of the author's grandmother. The book portrays the brilliant image of a working woman, reflecting the Czech rural life at that time and the simple and kind relationship between the working people. Here we can see many kind people, whose simple lives and humorous language will deeply attract us.

    “红旗谱”
    梁斌的长篇小说“红旗谱”是一部好作品。它通过朱老忠、严志和两家农民祖孙三代的变化和地主冯老兰的历史，描写了滹沱河两岸农村在大革命前后的阶级斗争面貌；并通过“四·一二”政变对冀中人民的深广影响，描写了在党领导下掀起的反割头税运动和为了抗日在保定第二师范引起的学潮斗争。
    作者以朴实的笔触，塑造了朱老忠、严志和祖孙三代的英雄形象，生动地描绘了三代人在不同时代的不同遭遇，并描写了严江涛和张嘉庆两个不同阶级出身的青年，怎样在党领导下，经过斗争烈火的冶炼，成为坚强的革命战士。书中充满了革命乐观情绪和比较浓厚的生活气息，革命斗争场面的描写是激动人心的。
    “红日”
    反映第三次国内革命战争的作品，除过去出版的杜鹏程的“保卫延安”外，最近又出版了吴强的“红日”。
    “红日”的故事是围绕着华东战场著名的莱芜和孟良崮两大战役展开的。人民解放军某军军长沈振新是贯穿全部作品的中心人物。他是一个贫农出身的经过长征的老干部，对于革命事业无限忠诚，对于下级无比爱护。虽然他表面看来有些暴躁，实际上他的内心情感却是非常丰富深厚的。作者比较生动地刻划了这个高级指挥员的形象。与此同时，作者也写出了副军长梁波、团长刘长胜、以及战士秦守本、张华峰等不同类型人物的不同性格。通过对于这些人物的刻划，以及对他们崇高的内心情感的剖析，作品反映了我们人民军队的英雄气概和无敌的力量，也使读者比较全面地了解了部队生活的丰富内容，从而认识到、理解到人民解放军的无穷的战斗力量是从何而来的。
    “外祖母”
    聂姆曹娃是十九世纪捷克最伟大的现实主义作家，也是捷克近代散文文学的奠基人。她一生都在为争取民族解放和妇女自由而斗争，她的文学作品实际上也就是她的战斗生活的一个组成部份。她暮年时写成的“外祖母”是驰名世界文坛的一部长篇小说。它是作者根据自己对外婆的儿时回忆写成的，但又不是作者外婆的传记。书中塑造了一个劳动妇女的光辉形象，反映了捷克当时农村生活情景以及劳动人民之间的纯朴而善良的关系。在这里我们可以看到很多善良的人，他们朴实的生活和饶有风趣的语言都会深深吸引住我们。
