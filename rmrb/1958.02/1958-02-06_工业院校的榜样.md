　　A Role Model for Industrial Colleges
　　Li Zi
    Implementing work-study programs, and cultivating young students to become new-type laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, is not only the urgent requirement of young students, but also a practice that meets the needs of 600 million people.
    How can we do it well? The Xi'an Aviation Technical School and the Beijing Aviation Institute have already shown us the way. In these two schools, experimental equipment has started production, students have participated in labor, and the school's funding has become partially self-sufficient. What does this mean? Allowing the school's experimental equipment to start production reduces the backlog and waste of industrial equipment, increases the wealth of the country, and increases the income of the school; allowing students to participate in labor strengthens their concept of diligence and thrift, and improves their understanding of book knowledge; allowing the school to be partially or fully self-sufficient saves the country's funds; these saved funds can be used to establish more schools or add more classes, increasing the number of industrial and technical cadres for the country, improving the country's industrial and technical level, and further meeting the people's demand for improved culture. This accomplishes several things at once. But it must be recognized that these are not just some changes in working methods, but will prompt teachers to make a series of changes in teaching ideology, teaching content, teaching methods, teaching organization, and work. At the same time, educational administrators should also make changes in administrative organization and management. This is an essential change in the thorough socialistization of education.
    Experimental equipment starts production; students participate in labor; schools are partially self-sufficient; these all run counter to the old bourgeois educational norms. To do this, we must break with convention. The most fundamental obstacle that will inevitably be encountered in promoting this work is the bourgeois educational ideology of theory divorced from practice and belittling physical labor. In order to run socialist education well, we must break through this obstacle.
    Let all industrial colleges launch a great debate on the two paths of educational ideology. The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. Socialist educational thought will inevitably defeat bourgeois educational thought.

　　工业院校的榜样
　　李梓
    实行勤工俭学，半工半读，把青年学生培养成为新型的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，这不仅是青年学生的迫切要求，也是符合六亿人民需要的做法。
    怎样做才好？西安的航空技工学校、北京的航空学院已经给我们指出了道路。在这两所学校里，实验设备开工生产了，学生们参加了劳动，学校经费自给了一部分。这些意味着什么呢？让学校的实验设备开工生产，这就减少了工业设备的积压浪费，为国家增加了财富，为学校增加了收入；让学生们参加劳动，这既加强了学生们的勤劳节俭的观念，又提高了学生们对书本知识的理解；让学校自给一部分或全部分，这就节省了国家的资金；这些节省下来的资金就可以用来增设学校或增设班次，为国家增加大量工业技术干部，提高国家工业技术水平，同时可以进一步满足人民提高文化的要求。这样作，一举数得。但是必须认识这不只是工作方法上的一些改变，这将促使教师们在教学思想，教学内容，教学方法，教学组织，工作方面作一系列的改变。同时，教育行政人员在行政组织和管理方面也要有所改变。这是教育工作彻底社会主义化的本质的改变。
    实验设备开工生产；学生参加劳动；学校自给一部分；这些都是一反过去资产阶级教育常规的。这样作，就要打破常规。在推进这一工作时所必然会遇到的最根本的障碍是资产阶级的理论脱离实际，轻视体力劳动的教育思想。为了办好社会主义教育事业，我们必须突破这一障碍。
    让所有工业院校展开一次教育思想上的两条道路的大辩论，真理是越辩越明的。社会主义教育思想必然战胜资产阶级教育思想。
