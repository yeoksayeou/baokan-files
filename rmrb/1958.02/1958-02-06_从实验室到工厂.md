　　From Laboratory to Factory
　　By our reporter Bai Sheng
    This is a new type of factory.
    In the northeast corner of the vast and beautiful campus of Beijing Aviation Institute, there is a row of spacious and bright gray buildings, which are the school's many laboratories. No, that's outdated. This is a new type of factory for the school to cultivate red aviation engineers.
    With a sense of excitement, on the sunny winter morning of February 1st, I walked into several laboratories of this factory. Experimenters and technicians were busy conducting various experiments or operations, meticulously making various instruments. In the instrument workshop, I saw many precision instruments made by teachers and workers, which surprised me. What is the difference between these precision instruments and the products manufactured by factories specializing in instrument production! The five self-made static and dynamic strain gauges placed in the instrument workshop, their precision and quality have approached the international level. This instrument is used to measure the stress of airplanes, automobiles, ships, bridges, large reservoirs, and mines. In the past, this instrument mainly relied on imports. This workshop has a static and dynamic strain gauge bought from Switzerland, and the self-made one is almost exactly the same as it. In order to ensure and meet the needs of teaching and scientific research, they have self-made 323 kinds of teaching instruments. At the same time, they process and customize 33 kinds of products for 170 units outside the school. The sales of strain gauge resistance filaments for industrial stress analysis have spread throughout the country. The production of only three stress analysis instruments, static and dynamic strain gauges, strain gauge resistance filaments, and concrete strain gauges, can save the country 890,000 yuan in foreign exchange a year. For some special instruments that are difficult to buy domestically, such as the wind tunnel balance for testing aircraft performance urgently needed for teaching, which could not be ordered at home and abroad for a while, teachers and experimenters imitated Soviet products for trial production, and produced three wind tunnel balances, with a price one-third cheaper than foreign products.
    In the internship workshop, I saw many finished products made by lower-grade students in combination with their homework during the internship class, such as many exquisite hand-cranked bench drills for agricultural machinery repair, iron forks for mines, iron kettles and coal stoves for households, and also saw products such as variable speed gears and piston pins trial-produced by senior students in combination with their internship assignments. The quality of these products seems to be very good. How happy the students are when they see the results of their own labor! Some students even specially buy back the finished products they produced as souvenirs.
    The scene a year ago
    But what was the situation in these laboratories a year ago? At that time, due to the limited time for teaching practice and laboratory classes each year, the doors of the laboratories were mostly closed. Here were complete sets of modern teaching equipment, but the utilization rate was only 30% per semester, especially during holidays, when most of them went into a dormant state. The laboratory had a large technical force from professors to experimenters and technicians, but their potential could not be brought into play. At that time, most of the raw materials used for teaching practice and experiments were scrapped after the practice experiments. The cost of materials for students to use for practice experiments alone cost 200,000 yuan each year. The metal materials used for internship each semester were about 138,000 kilograms, and the consumption and waste that turned into waste materials reached 81,000 kilograms. No wonder the students used to say humorously: "Internship is making waste products!"
    In a corner next to the internship workshop, I saw a large pile of scrap iron and steel piled up. There were a large number of steel bars, steel pipes, and iron sheets, all of which were rusty and covered with a layer of dust. The experimenter told me that this was the raw material that was scrapped and wasted after the students had taken the internship class in the past. Even this pile of steel is still very painful to see now!
    How the road was taken
    It was in March last year that Beijing Aviation Institute launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and the large amount of backlog and waste in the laboratory was exposed. Many teachers, students, and staff wrote blackboards and put forward the slogan: "Give full play to the potential of the laboratory, our teaching equipment must be fully utilized!" The president and the Party committee began to study how to solve this problem. In this way, the direction of running schools with diligence and thrift, utilizing existing teaching equipment and technical forces, and organizing production activities combined with teaching in a planned way on the principle of ensuring the needs of teaching and scientific research was put forward. However, this new direction of running schools with diligence and thrift, combining teaching and production, and turning laboratories into factories, was not very clear at the beginning. At that time, a debate was aroused among teachers and technicians.
    Many teachers, because they were accustomed to the old teaching methods that were divorced from practice, and had ideas of despising labor and despising practice, they did not pay attention to or were unwilling to go to the laboratory at all. Some teachers in the teaching and research department rarely went to the laboratory a few times a year. They handed over the task of tutoring experiments and internships to experimenters and technicians, and were unwilling to intervene. And many experimental staff in the laboratory could not improve their skills because they were doing experiments for the sake of experiments all year round. Some technicians and skilled workers were also uneasy about their work because they were influenced by teachers who despised practical work and one-sidedly emphasized the study of theory. Therefore, these teachers were afraid that combining teaching with production would hinder the completion of teaching and scientific research tasks and affect the quality of teaching; some experimenters were afraid that combining with production would affect their time to "march towards science"; some technicians were also worried that the machines in the laboratory would be damaged if they were combined with production. In short, there were many ideological concerns. Facing these ideological problems, how to better carry out this new topic! At that time, the leaders of the Party committee and the administrative leaders repeatedly studied this issue, although they did not clearly realize that how to run the laboratory well was already facing the serious problem of taking the capitalist and socialist roads. However, how to make the laboratory work conform to the socialist ideology of running schools with diligence and thrift was a relatively clear issue in the leadership's thinking.
    Advanced leads the backward
    In this way, the leaders of the institute began to understand the work of some laboratories in depth, solicited the opinions of many teachers and experimental technicians, and studied with them the issue of combining teaching with production and running laboratories with diligence and thrift. First, we started with some laboratories that supported the combination of teaching and production and advocated making full use of teaching equipment and technical potential to engage in production activities. For example, laboratories 302, 104, and the internship workshop. These teaching units had combined teaching and scientific research work to produce many teaching and experimental instruments in the past. The leaders of these units also supported the laboratory in organizing various production activities on the premise of ensuring the completion of teaching tasks. With the help of the school leaders, these laboratories first created the advanced experience of combining teaching and production, running schools with diligence and thrift, and producing with diligence and thrift.
    At that time, there was a clear contrast. That is, laboratories 302 and 303. These two laboratories were adjacent to each other, in a building. Everyone entered and exited through the same gate every day, but due to different ideological understandings of combining teaching with production, laboratory 302 quickly invested in production in combination with teaching with the support of the leadership, and the teachers and technicians were very motivated. Teachers personally came to the laboratory to help technicians study how to combine teaching to produce various products, and at the same time carried out scientific research from production. What about the students? In the experimental process, because theory was linked to practice, the quality of the experiment was also significantly improved, and the students' view of loving labor was strengthened. The technicians became more proficient in their skills due to frequent operations, and labor discipline was also strengthened. In a very short period of time, they have self-made many products and created a batch of wealth for the country. But what about laboratory 303? Because the leaders only considered the construction work of their own laboratory, and still had ideological concerns about combining teaching with production, they did not move for a long time. It was not until they saw the clear changes in laboratory 302 in combining teaching with production that they gradually changed their views. With the help of the institute leaders, they soon caught up. Now, they are a laboratory that is actively involved in production.
    Since July last year, eleven of the fourteen laboratories in the institute with production capacity have combined teaching with production in a planned and organized manner with 250 sets of teaching equipment. According to the equipment and technical capabilities and production characteristics of each laboratory and internship workshop, production tasks were arranged in a unified manner, and each laboratory successively established a production team.
    Old professors Sun Zhenjun and Peng Deyi, who had been influenced by bourgeois theory divorced from practical education for a long time, told me about their feelings with infinite emotion. Look, how much our laboratory has changed in the past year! The socialist idea of running schools with diligence and thrift not only greatly reduced the waste in our laboratory, saved the country's expenses, and achieved partial financial self-sufficiency, but also guided us on the teaching direction of linking theory with practice. Now, under the guidance of the school, we are preparing to study how to further engage in work-study production activities among students! Young technician Bai Baoku also enthusiastically told me about their motivation and ideological gains after turning the laboratory into a factory.
    The direction of socialist education
    Facing the warm winter sun, I walked out of this new type of factory, and my heart could not calm down for a long time. What force made such laboratories change their old appearance, and what force guided them from the road of waste to the road of production? I know that although this is only a small part of the great changes in a corner of socialist life, it must be a newly occurring thing that encourages us to move forward. Turning the laboratory into a factory, this road embodies the socialist idea of running schools with diligence and thrift. This is a method of running schools by breaking old conventions with a revolutionary spirit. It is a new direction of socialist education and a basic policy.
    Now, Beijing Aviation Institute is only at the beginning of turning the laboratory into a factory. It still faces some new problems that have not been solved, such as how to better arrange production tasks in combination with teaching, how to further according to the needs of teaching and scientific research, and the needs of national construction, gradually incorporate this new production force into the national plan track, and how to better carry out work-study activities among students. But no matter what, it has set an example for all institutions of higher learning of the same nature. If all the qualified engineering colleges and universities in the country can turn the laboratory into a factory, achieve diligence and thrift in running schools, diligence and thrift in production, and work-study programs, then how many new types of factories for training red engineers will appear in our country!

　　从实验室到工厂
　　本报记者  柏生
    这是一座新型的工厂
    在北京航空学院广阔美丽的校园的东北角上，有一排宽敞明亮的灰色房子，这是这个学校的许多实验室。不，这样说已经过时了，这是这个学校培养红色航空工程师的一座新型的工厂。
    怀着一种兴奋的感情，在2月1日这个阳光照耀的冬日早晨，我走进了这座工厂的几个实验室。实验员和技工们正在忙着进行各种实验或操作，在细心地制作着各种仪器。在仪表车间，我看到了教师、职工共同劳动制作出来的许多精密仪器，这不禁使我惊奇，这些精密仪器和专门生产仪器的工厂制造出来的产品有什么区别呢！放在仪表车间的五架自制的静动态应变仪，它的精密度和质量已经接近了国际水平。这种仪器是供测量飞机、汽车、船舶、桥梁、大型水库、矿坑等的应力用的。过去这种仪器主要靠国外进口，这个车间有一架从瑞士买来的静动态应变仪，自制的几乎完全和它一样。为了保证和满足教学和科学研究工作的需要，他们已经自制了三百二十三种教学仪器，同时为校外一百七十个单位加工订制三十三种产品，其中供工业上作应力分析用的测应变电阻丝片的销售已遍及全国，仅静动态应变仪、测应变电阻丝片和混凝土应变计三项应力分析仪器的生产，一年就可以为国家节省价值八十九万元的外汇。对于国内难买到的一些特殊仪器，如教学上急需的试验飞机性能用的风洞天秤，在国内外一时都订不到货，教师和实验员就仿照苏联成品进行试制，并且生产了三台风洞天秤，定价比国外便宜三分之一。
    在实习车间，我看到了低年级学生在上实习课时，结合作业制作出来的许多成品，如供农业机械修理用的许多精致的手摇台钻，供矿山用的铁叉子，供家庭用的铁壶和煤炉子，也看到高年级学生结合实习作业试制出来的变速齿轮和活塞梢等产品。这些产品的质量看来都很好。学生们看到自己双手劳动出来的成果时，是多么高兴呵！有些学生还特别把自己生产的成品买回去作纪念品。
    一年前的情景
    可是，一年前，这些实验室的情况是怎样的呢？那时候，由于每年进行教学实习和上实验课的时间有限，实验室的门大部分时间是关着的。这里摆着成套的现代化的教学设备，每学期的利用率只占30％，特别是假期，绝大部分都进入睡眠状态。实验室拥有从教授到实验员、技术工人的大量技术力量，但他们的潜力不能发挥。那时候，教学实习实验用的原材料，经过实习实验后大部分就都报废了。每年仅为学生用来实习实验的一笔材料费就得花二十万元。每学期实习用的金属材料约十三万八千多公斤，耗损浪费变为废料的就达八万一千多公斤。难怪过去学生们幽默地说：“实习就是制造废品！”
    在实习车间旁的一个角落里，我看到堆集着一大堆废铁、废钢，这里有大量的钢条、钢管和铁片，它们都生了锈，上面落满了一层尘土。实验人员告诉我，这就是过去学生们上过实习课以后，所报废和浪费掉的原材料。仅这堆钢铁，现在看了还叫人非常痛心！
    路是怎样走的
    那是去年3月间，北京航空学院轰轰烈烈地开展了增产节约运动，实验室的大量积压浪费现象，被揭露出来。许多师生员工纷纷写了黑板报，提出：“充分发挥实验室的潜力，我们的教学设备必须充分利用！”的口号。院长和党委都开始研究考虑如何来解决这个问题。这样，如何在保证教学和科学研究工作需要的原则下，利用现有教学设备和技术力量，有计划地组织与教学相结合的生产活动，勤俭办学的方向提出来了。但是，这个把教学和生产相结合，把实验室变成工厂的勤俭办学的新方向，一开始并不是很明确的。当时在教师和技术人员中间就引起了一场争论。
    不少教师因为习惯于过去那一套理论脱离实际的教学方法，和存在着轻视劳动，轻视实践的思想，他们根本不重视也不愿意下实验室。有些教研室的教师一年中很少到实验室去几次，他们把辅导实验和实习的任务，交给了实验员、技术员，自己不愿过问。而实验室的许多实验工作人员，因为常年都是为实习而实习，技术不能提高。有些技术员和技工因为受了教师们轻视实际劳动，片面强调钻研理论的影响，也不安心工作。因此，这些教师怕结合教学进行生产，会要妨碍教学和科学研究工作任务的完成，影响教学质量；一些实验员怕结合了生产，影响了自己“向科学进军”的时间，一些技术人员还耽心实验室的机器一结合生产会受到损坏。总之，思想顾虑是很多的，面对着这些思想问题，如何把这一新的课题更好地开展起来呢！当时院党委和行政领导上一再研究了这个问题，虽然并没有明确地认识到如何办好实验室，已经面临着走资本主义和社会主义两条道路的严重问题。但是，如何使实验室工作合乎勤俭办学的社会主义办学思想，这是领导思想上比较明确的问题。
    先进带动落后
    这样，院领导开始深入了解了一些实验室的工作情况，征求了不少教师和实验技术人员的意见，和他们一起研究教学结合生产，勤俭办实验室的问题。先从一些支持结合教学进行生产，主张充分利用教学设备和技术潜力从事生产活动的实验室试行做起。例如三○二、一○四等实验室和实习车间，这几个教学单位，过去都曾经结合教学和科学研究工作制作了不少教学实验仪器。这几个单位的领导人也都是支持实验室在保证教学任务的完成下，组织各种生产活动的。在学校领导的帮助下，这些实验室首先创造了教学和生产相结合的勤俭办学、勤俭生产的先进经验。
    当时，有个鲜明的对比。那就是三○二和三○三两个实验室。这两个实验室是毗邻，在一座楼，每天大家出入都走一个大门，但是由于对教学结合生产的思想认识不同，三○二实验室在领导的支持下很快地结合教学投入了生产，教师和技术人员的干劲很大。教师亲自下实验室里来，帮助技术人员一起研究如何结合教学制作各种产品，同时从生产中也进行了科学研究工作。学生呢？在实验过程中，由于理论联系实际，也显著地提高了实验的质量，加强了学生热爱劳动的观点。技术人员由于经常操作，技术更加熟练了，劳动纪律也加强了。在很短的一段时间中，他们已经自制了许多产品，为国家创造了一批财富。可是三○三实验室呢？因为领导上只考虑本实验室的建设工作，而对教学结合生产在思想上还有顾虑，因此在很长的一段时间里，他们都没有动起来，直到亲眼看到三○二实验室在教学结合生产中的鲜明变化，才逐渐改变了他们的看法。在院领导的帮助下，不久他们也很快地跟了上去。现在，他们已是个积极结合生产的实验室了。
    从去年7月开始，全院有生产能力的十四个实验室，已有十一个实验室的二百五十套教学设备，先后有计划有组织地结合教学进行了生产。根据各实验室和各实习车间的设备技术能力和生产特点，统一安排了生产任务，每个实验室并先后成立了生产小组。
    曾经长期受资产阶级理论脱离实际的教育影响的老教授孙振均和彭德一，无限感慨地对我谈起了他们的感想。看看，一年来我们的实验室变化多大呵！社会主义勤俭办学的思想，不但使我们的实验室大大减少了浪费，节省了国家的开支，做到了部分经费自给，也引导我们走上了理论联系实际的教学方向。现在，我们在学校的指示下正准备研究如何在学生中进一步搞勤工俭学的生产活动呢！青年技术员白宝库也热情地对我谈起把实验室变成工厂后，他们的干劲和思想收获。
    社会主义办学的方向
    迎着冬日的温暖的阳光，我走出了这座新型的工厂，心里久久地不能平息。是什么力量使这样一座座实验室改变了旧日的面貌，是什么力量指引着它们从浪费的道路走上了生产的道路？我知道，这虽然仅仅是社会主义生活的一个角落里的伟大变化中的一点，但是它必然是一件新发生的鼓舞我们前进的事情。把实验室变成工厂，这条道路体现了社会主义勤俭办学的思想，这是一种以革命的精神打破陈规办学的方法，它是社会主义办学的一个新方向，也是基本方针。
    现在，北京航空学院在把实验室变成工厂的做法上，还仅仅是一个开始，它还面临着一些新的问题没有解决，譬如如何结合教学更好地安排生产任务的问题，如何进一步根据教学和科学研究的需要，和国家建设的需要，逐步地把这一支新的生产力量纳入国家计划轨道的问题，以及如何更好地在学生中开展勤工俭学的活动的问题。但是，不论如何，它已是为所有同类性质的高等学校树立了一个榜样。假如全国所有有条件的工科高等学校都能把实验室变成工厂，做到勤俭办学、勤俭生产、勤工俭学，那么，我们的祖国各地将会出现多少座培养红色工程师的新型工厂呵！
