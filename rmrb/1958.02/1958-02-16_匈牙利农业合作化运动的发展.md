    The Development of Hungary's Agricultural Cooperativization Movement
    By our reporter, Hu Jibang
    In the first year after suffering counter-revolutionary destruction, Hungarian agricultural production achieved great success. Farmers were as happy with this year's harvest as they were when they received land in 1945. The government encouraged farmers' production enthusiasm through price policies. Thanks to the diligence of the farmers, almost no arable land in the country was left uncultivated. The output of various major crops generally increased, and the number of livestock also increased significantly. The total value of agricultural products for the year was approximately 42.5 billion forints, an increase of 4.5 billion forints compared to 1956, and an increase of approximately 7.5 billion forints compared to the average total value of the pre-war years.
    According to the 1955 statistics, agriculture's position in the Hungarian national economy accounted for 38.6% of the national income, and agricultural products accounted for 38.4% of export trade. The agricultural population accounted for 44.2% of the total population. It is said that the density of the rural population in Hungary ranks first in Europe. Therefore, the Party and the government particularly emphasized the importance of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation and the development of animal husbandry, and have made certain achievements in this regard.
  1957 was a year of high agricultural production
    Over the past year, the supply of agricultural products to cities has been better than in previous years, while also ensuring the supply of raw materials for light industry and the completion of agricultural export plans. After the government abolished the compulsory purchase system and regulations on the planting area of ​​grain, the country's biggest concern was how to ensure the supply of grain. Farmers' interest in animal husbandry has greatly increased. Therefore, in 1957, the planting area of ​​wheat decreased, and the planting area of ​​feed, especially corn, increased accordingly. As a result of farmers' deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, the total wheat output increased compared to 1956, estimated at 1.95 million tons. The state needs to control 1.2 million tons, of which 100,000 tons are reserve grain. One million tons have now been received, of which 800,000 tons were paid by land tax, state farms, tractor stations, and mills, and the remainder accounts for approximately 16%. In the past, it was obtained through the compulsory purchase system, but now it is freely purchased at market prices. At the beginning of last year, 530,000 tons of wheat were originally ordered from the Soviet Union, but later it was changed to 140,000 tons. These 140,000 tons will be exchanged with the Soviet Union for corn. The government plans to strive to achieve complete self-sufficiency in grain within one or two years by increasing the yield per unit area.
    Farmers' tax payments to the state were also completed more smoothly than in previous years. Farmers' incomes have generally increased, averaging about 20%-25%, and the government has supplied a large number of industrial products to rural areas. The achievements made on the agricultural front this year made both the government and the farmers happy, further increased the Party's prestige among the farmers, and improved the relationship between rural cadres and farmers.
    The achievement of this victory is due to natural factors, a good harvest year, and political factors. The policies and measures adopted by the Party and the government in rural areas after the counter-revolutionary rebellion was quelled have produced positive results.
    There are two different evaluations among cadres regarding the abolition of the compulsory purchase system. The departments in charge of taxation and purchase emphasize its positive aspects more, believing that the goal of increasing production has been achieved, and that purchasing (ordering production and sales contracts and buying on the free market) through tax and price policies is more flexible and effective than the compulsory purchase system. The agricultural departments leading production cooperatives believe that abolishing the compulsory purchase system and changing it to the purchase system was a transitional method adopted out of necessity after the counter-revolutionary rebellion; it also brought about negative aspects, that is, rural capitalism has grown somewhat, and farmers hope to maintain the status quo, which will affect the development of the cooperative movement. However, both departments believe that only large-scale collective agriculture can continuously increase production, and the state can actively realize planned leadership. Over the past year, while generally encouraging production, the Party and the government have strived to assist in the restoration and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. More than 1,000 advanced cooperatives have been reorganized after counter-revolutionary destruction, and most of them have surpluses in the year-end settlement. The cooperatives' public accumulation funds generally exceeded the regulations, increasing to about 10% to 15%.
    In this year's free production competition between collective and individual farmers, the small-scale peasant economy also achieved some development. But this was obtained under good harvest conditions, and it has certain limits. Although the production cooperative suffered counter-revolutionary damage not long ago, it was able to quickly recover, gain a foothold, and demonstrate the superiority of production. For example, in grain harvest, cooperatives generally yielded 30% more than individual farmers, and production costs were about 25% lower. In one-third of the well-managed cooperatives, the average income of members has caught up with the level of middle peasants, and the members of medium-sized production cooperatives also generally exceed the income of small peasants.
    However, at present, 76% of Hungary's arable land is still operated in small and dispersed plots, and more than 80% of farmers have not yet been organized. The scale of the existing 2,607 agricultural cooperatives is also relatively small, indicating that the potential capacity in agriculture has not yet been fully utilized. The agricultural program formulated by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party a few months ago and recent newspaper articles have repeatedly publicized and emphasized the superiority of large-scale agricultural production, pointing out that this large-scale production is not only the path for farmers to achieve a prosperous life in socialist countries, but also in capitalist countries, farm owners are moving towards large-scale enterprise production in order to reduce costs and strengthen the competitiveness of agricultural products in the international market. The difference is that the capitalist road is to bankrupt small farmers and adopt methods of merger and elimination; the socialist road is to adopt methods of inducing farmers to collectivize. Revisionists, however, fantasize that the small-scale peasant economy can also expand reproduction and spontaneously grow into socialism.
    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has put the socialist transformation of agriculture on the agenda, pointing out that the countryside is the main front for the struggle between the two lines in the future. It can be seen that due to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the development of agricultural cooperativization in Hungary was once hindered, and it was slower than the agricultural cooperativization movements in other people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe. Revisionism is the main obstacle to agricultural cooperativization
    Before liberation, the class relations in Hungary's rural areas were acute, and the degree of land concentration was similar to that of Poland. Of the 10 million holds (one hold equals 8.55 mu) of arable land in the country, 48% belonged to landlords. The largest landlord occupied 140,000 holds, and church land reached 900,000 holds. Among the 5 million agricultural population, there were 3 million poor and hired peasants. Agricultural operations were backward, and Prussian-style feudal production relations dominated, characterized by low productivity and poor farmers. When the land reform was implemented in 1945, more than 600,000 peasant households were allocated more than 3.5 million holds of arable land. This situation was a favorable political condition for carrying out the cooperative movement.
    Hungary's agricultural cooperative movement started in 1948. By 1953, collectively operated land accounted for 25%, plus state-owned land 12%, accounting for 37% of the total arable land. For example, in the four famous cooperative towns in eastern Hungary, the land collectively operated in 1951 had reached 75%. Many farmers who used to be hired laborers and short-term workers on the landlords' estates formed production cooperatives together. For example, in the town of Kalocsa with a population of 23,000, 92% of the farmers had joined the cooperative before the October incident, and now it still accounts for 85%.
    If there had not been the attacks of revisionism and counter-revolution in 1953 and 1956, Hungary's agricultural cooperativization could have completely reached the level achieved by Czechoslovakia. After undergoing two fierce shocks in five years, the cause of cooperativization suffered no small setbacks.
    During the first five-year plan period, especially in 1952, due to the influence of the tense international situation at that time, there was excessive industrial investment, and left-leaning rashness errors were committed. The agricultural cooperativization movement also committed errors of coercion and commandism due to the one-sided pursuit of numbers. Some farmers were negatively disposed toward the land due to excessive burdens, abandoned farming and went to work, and a large number of them flowed into the cities. In addition to the drought, 900,000 holds of land were abandoned in 1952, agricultural production declined, and urban supply was tight. In 1953, efforts began to correct the deviation. At that time, the Hungarian Working People's Party made a correct resolution to correct the errors in June. However, after Nagy became Chairman of the Council of Ministers, he violated the Party's resolution and took the opportunity to implement his own set of revisionist agricultural programs. In his government's policy program, he openly declared that "our agricultural production mainly relies on the small-scale peasant economy, and their production is necessary for the country. ...The government believes that encouraging the production of individual farmers is the primary task." He also declared: "The government will allow free leasing of land. If anyone is willing to take back for their own use the land that was previously dedicated to the state and is now retained by the government as part of the reserve land, they can take it back." At that time, most of the rich peasants had donated land exceeding that of the middle peasants in order to escape heavy taxes. This land had become the state's reserve land and the state had handed it over to production cooperatives for use. If the production cooperatives were dissolved, the rich peasants could legally reclaim the land. Nagy also publicly issued fallacies such as canceling the list of rich peasants and allowing farmers to freely withdraw from cooperatives. Nagy has always regarded himself as an expert on land issues within the Party. From theory to practice, he has consistently advocated consolidating the small-scale peasant economy, exaggerating the shortcomings of the cooperatives' mismanagement and waste, and opposing the path of cooperative large-scale production. At that time, local cadres felt very sudden about Nagy's statement, causing ideological confusion. The consequence was that not only did the individual farming ideas of the middle and small peasants rise, but also the confidence of some poor and hired peasants in the cooperatives was shaken, thinking that since the government did not support the cooperatives, it would be better to farm individually. Some farmers took rising to "middle peasant" as their goal. The rich peasants swaggered to the township government to demand the return of land and farm tools, and openly united with the middle peasants to launch an attack on the cooperatives. As a result, within two months, one-third of the production cooperatives were dissolved, and a large number of middle peasants withdrew from the production cooperatives.
    In early 1955, Nagy was dismissed. In that year, the production cooperatives had been restored to near their original level, but in the spring of 1956, the right-wing group once again attacked the cause of cooperativization. In early October, the right-wing group held a rural cadre meeting in Somogy County in the west, where they promoted that Hungarian farmers have their own characteristics and simply do not like production cooperatives, advocating that the economy of individual farmers should be developed and consolidated first, and that farmers would voluntarily join the cooperatives only when the income of all members exceeded that of the middle peasants; therefore, they came to such a conclusion: "The development of production cooperatives is a matter of decades later." The right-wing group also falsely accused the past road of cooperativization as completely wrong. Under the influence of this inflammatory rhetoric, the production cooperatives in this state were dissolved in large numbers again, just like in 1953, and many middle peasants withdrew from the cooperatives again, which ideologically and practically mobilized the counter-revolutionaries to attack the Party and the cooperatives in the rural areas.
    The large-scale dissolution of production cooperatives and the withdrawal of middle peasants occurred after November 4, 1956, mainly in late December and early January 1957. At that time, after the counter-revolutionary forces failed in the cities, some retreated to the countryside, attempting to disintegrate the socialist foundation in the rural areas. At that time, the Party and the government had no power to take care of the rural areas, so one-third of the cooperatives were dissolved. The counter-revolutionary attack on the cooperatives this time also used "reclaiming the original land" as the main slogan to incite the peasants, and used violence to attack those cooperatives with strong economic foundations.
    Individual farmers whose land had been adjusted by the production cooperatives in the past demanded the return of their original land, the withdrawing farmers demanded to take away their own plot of land, the rich peasants demanded the return of the donated land, and some even arbitrarily occupied and seized public land, creating a tense and chaotic state in the countryside. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government promulgated a decree in early February 1957 to guarantee the land legally used by cooperative members and individual farmers, pointing out that any unauthorized division of public land was invalid. On the other hand, compensation was allowed for farmers who suffered losses during land adjustment. This stabilized the order in the countryside and the spring plowing at that time. One-third of the production cooperatives firmly, and even armed themselves to defend their cooperatives and public wealth. Some cooperatives temporarily broke up in panic. For example, the Petőfi Production Cooperative in eastern Hungary sold all its livestock to individual farmers within two days because it was afraid of counter-revolutionary looting; and returned the cash received to repay the debts borrowed from the government over the years. There are many such examples. Because many cooperatives were dissolved under violence and threats, after the counter-revolution was crushed nationwide, some poor and hired peasants began to reorganize from February.
    As of December 1957, the achievements of Hungary's agricultural cooperativization movement are shown in the following table:

    匈牙利农业合作化运动的发展
    本报记者　胡济邦
    在遭受反革命破坏后的第一年，匈牙利农业生产已取得巨大成就，农民对于这一年的收获，像在1945年分得土地时那样高兴。政府通过物价政策，鼓励了农民的生产情绪。由于农民的勤奋，全国几乎没有一块荒芜的耕地。各种主要作物普遍增产，牲口数量也有显著增加，全年农产品价值约合四百二十五亿福林，比1956年增加四十五亿福林，比战前几年的平均总值约增加七十五亿福林。
    农业生产在匈牙利国民经济中的地位，据1955年的统计，占国民收入的38.6％，农产品占出口贸易的38.4％。农业人口占全国总人口的44.2％。匈牙利农村人口的密度据说在欧洲居首位，因此，党和政府特别强调深耕细作和发展畜牧业的重要意义，而且在这方面已作出了一定的成绩。
  1957年是农业生产高涨的一年
    一年来，城市农产品的供应比往年都好，同时还保证了轻工业原料的供给和农产品出口计划的完成。政府在取消征购制和关于谷物播种面积的规定后，全国最关心的是如何保证粮食的供应问题。农民对养畜业的兴趣大为提高，因此1957年小麦播种面积减少，饲料、特别是玉米的播种面积相应扩大。由于农民深耕细作的结果，小麦总产量比1956年增加了，估计达一百九十五万吨。国家需要掌握一百二十万吨，其中十万吨为后备粮。现已收到一百万吨，其中八十万吨是由土地税、国营农场、拖拉机站和磨坊缴纳的，其余约合16％。过去由征购制取得，现在则按市场价格自由收购。去年初，原向苏联订购小麦五十三万吨，后来改为十四万吨，这十四万吨将用玉米和苏联交换。政府计划在一、二年内，从提高单位面积产量上努力，作到粮食完全自给。
    农民对国家的纳税也比往年完成得顺利。农民收入普遍提高，平均约增20％—25％，政府并以大量工业品供应农村。这一年在农业战线上取得的成就，使政府和农民皆大欢喜，使党在农民中的威信更加提高，使农村干部和农民之间的关系也获得了改善。
    这个胜利的取得，一是由于自然因素，年成好，二是由于政治因素，党和政府在反革命叛乱平息后对农村所采取的政策和措施产生了积极效果。
    对征购制的取消，在干部中间有两种不同的估价。主管税收和收购的部门强调其积极的一面较多，认为增产目的已达到，通过税收和物价政策，进行收购（订产销合同和自由市场上的收买）比征购制更为灵活有效，领导生产合作社的农业部门则认为，取消征购制改为收购制是在反革命叛乱之后不得已的过渡办法；它也带来消极的一面，即农村资本主义有些滋长，农民希望保持现状，这会影响合作运动的开展。但是无论哪一个部门都认为只有集体化的大型农业才能不断提高生产，国家才能主动地实现有计划的领导。一年来党和政府在普遍鼓励生产的同时，努力协助农业合作社的恢复和巩固。在反革命破坏后重新组织起来的高级社约有一千多个，它们在年终结算时，绝大多数都有盈余。社的公积金一般都超过规定，提高到10％到15％左右。
    这一年集体和个体农民在自由生产的竞赛中，小农经济也获得某些发展。但这是在好年成的条件下而获得的，它有一定的限度，而生产合作社虽在不久前遭受反革命的破坏，仍能迅速恢复起来，站住了脚，而且显示出生产的优越性。如粮食收成，合作社比个体农民一般高出30％，生产成本约低25％，有三分之一经营良好的社，社员平均收入已赶上中农的水平，中等的生产合作社社员也普遍超过小农的收入。
    但目前匈牙利尚有76％的耕地是小块分散经营的，80％以上的农民还没有组织起来，现有的二千六百零七个农业合作社的规模也是比较小的，可见农业中的潜在能力还远未发挥。匈牙利社会主义工人党在几个月前制订的农业纲领和最近时期的报刊文章，都一再宣传和强调农业大规模生产的优越性，指出这种大规模生产不仅在社会主义国家是使农民走向富裕生活的发展道路，就是在资本主义国家，农场主为了降低成本，加强农产品在国际市场的竞争能力，也都走向大企业的生产。所不同的是：资本主义道路是使小农破产，采取兼并和淘汰的办法；社会主义的道路则是采取诱导农民集体化的办法。而修正主义者却幻想小农经济也能扩大再生产，能自流地长入社会主义。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党已把农业的社会主义改造提上日程，指出农村是今后两条路线斗争的主要阵地。可见由于反革命的叛乱，匈牙利农业合作化的发展曾一度受到了阻挠，比起东欧其他各人民民主国家的农业合作化运动缓慢了一些。修正主义是农业合作化的主要障碍
    解放前的匈牙利，农村阶级关系尖锐，土地集中程度与波兰相近，全国一千万霍尔特（一霍尔特合八点五五市亩）耕地中，48％属于地主所有。最大的一个地主占地达十四万霍尔特，教会土地达九十万霍尔特。五百万农业人口中有三百万贫雇农，农业经营落后，普鲁士式的封建生产关系占统治地位，其特点是生产力低，农民穷苦。1945年实行土地改革时，有六十多万户农民分得了三百五十多万霍尔特耕地，这种情况对于开展合作运动是一个有利的政治条件。
    匈牙利的农业合作化运动是从1948年开始的。到1953年，集体经营的土地已占25％，加上国营土地12％，占耕地总面积的37％。如在匈牙利东部地区著名的四个合作化小城，集体经营的土地在1951年已达到75％，有许多过去在地主庄园上当雇工和短工的农民原班一起组成生产合作社。如二万三千人口的卡尔察克城，十月事件前参加合作社的农民已占92％，现在仍占85％。
    如果没有1953年和1956年修正主义和反革命的进攻，匈牙利的农业合作化完全可以达到像捷克斯洛伐克所达到的水平。在五年之内经受两度激烈的震动，合作化事业遭受了不小的挫折。
    第一个五年计划时期，特别在1952年，由于当时国际紧张局势的影响，工业投资过多，犯了左倾冒进的错误，农业合作化运动也由于片面追求数字而犯了强迫命令的错误，一部分农民因负担过重，对土地抱消极态度，弃农从工，大批流入城市，又加上旱灾，以至于使1952年九十万霍尔特土地荒废，农业生产下降，城市供应紧张。1953年开始纠偏，当时匈牙利劳动人民党在6月作出纠正错误的正确决议。但由于纳吉当了部长会议主席，他违背了党的决议，乘机实行自己的一套修正主义农业纲领。他在政府的施政纲领中公然宣布“我们的农业生产主要是靠小农经济，他们的生产对国家是必须的。……政府认为鼓励个体农民的生产是首要的任务。”他又宣称：“政府要准许自由出租土地。如有人愿意把从前献给国家而现在由政府保留作为一部分后备地的土地收回自用，他们可以收回。”当时大部分富农为逃避重税曾将超过中农的土地捐献出来，这些土地已变成国家的后备土地，并且国家已把它交给生产合作社使用了。如果解散生产合作社，富农就可合法地收回土地。纳吉还公开发出取消富农名单、农民可以自由退社等等谬论。纳吉一向以党内的土地问题专家自居，他从理论到实践一贯主张巩固小农经济，夸大合作社由经营管理不仅造成浪费的缺点，而且反对走合作化大型生产的道路。当时地方干部对纳吉这种声明感到很突然，造成思想上的混乱。其后果不仅引起中农和小农的单干思想上升，而且使一部分贫雇农对于合作社的信心也发生动摇，认为政府既不支持合作社，则不如单干有前途了。一部分农民则以上升“中农”作为自己的奋斗目标。富农更是大摇大摆地来到乡政府要求归还土地和农具，公然联合中农向合作社发动进攻。结果在两个月之内，三分之一的生产合作社解散了，大批中农退出了生产合作社。
    1955年初，纳吉被撤职，在这一年生产合作社已被恢复起来，接近原有的水平，但1956年春天，右派集团又重新向合作化事业进攻。10月初，右派集团在西部绍莫吉州召开了一个农村干部大会，在会上宣扬匈牙利农民有自己的特点，根本不欢喜生产合作社，主张首先发展和巩固单干农民的经济，要等到所有社员的收入都超过中农时，农民就会自愿入社了；因此作出这样一个结论：“发展生产合作社是几十年以后的事。”右派集团还诬蔑过去的合作化道路完全是错误的。在这种煽惑言论的影响下，这一州的生产合作社又像1953年那样大批解散了，许多中农又退社了，这就为反革命在农村中向党和合作社进攻作了思想上和行动上的动员。
    生产合作社再度大批解散和中农退社是在1956年11月4日以后，主要在12月底和1957年1月上旬发生的。当时反革命力量在城市失败后，一部分退却到农村，企图在农村中瓦解社会主义基础。当时党和政府还没有力量顾到农村，因此三分之一的社被解散了。这次反革命向合作社的进攻也是以“收回原有土地”作为煽动农民的主要口号，并用暴力进攻那些经济基础强固的社。
    过去被生产合作社调整过土地的个体农民纷纷要求归还原有土地，退社农民要求带走自己的那块地，富农要求退还捐献的土地，有的更擅自占领和夺取公有土地，造成农村一度紧张而混乱的状态。匈牙利工农革命政府在1957年2月初公布法令保证社员和个体农民合法使用的土地，指出擅自分割公有土地一概无效。另一方面，允许对土地调整时受到损失的农民予以补偿。这才稳定当时农村的秩序和春耕的进行。其中有三分之一的生产合作社则是坚定不移地，甚至武装起来保卫住自己的社和公共财富。有一部分社是在惊惶失措中临时散伙的，如匈牙利东部的裴多菲生产合作社，当时因为怕反革命抢劫，在两天之内把全部牲口都拍卖给单干农民；并将收回的现款，归还历年向政府贷来的债务。情况稳定后，虽然已失去全部牲畜，但社员们又凑在一起，重新组织起来。这样的例子很多。由于许多社是处在暴力和威胁的情况下解散的，因此，当反革命在全国范围被粉碎后，从2月开始有些贫雇农又重新组织起来了。
    截止1957年12月止，匈牙利农业合作化运动的成就如下表：
