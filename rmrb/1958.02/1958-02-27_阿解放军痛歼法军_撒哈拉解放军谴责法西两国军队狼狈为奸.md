Xinhua News Agency, February 26th dispatch from Tunis: The Algerian National Liberation Army has continued to engage in fierce battles with the French colonial army over the past two days. In four major battles near Tablat, Akbou, the Soummam Valley, and Tenes on the 24th and 25th, a total of 93 French soldiers were killed or wounded, and three were captured alive.

Under the increasingly powerful strikes of the National Liberation Army, even the high-ranking officers of the French colonial army, such as paratrooper Colonel Bigeard, had to sadly admit that "time" is on the side of the Algerian people. He said that a year ago, the Algerian National Liberation Army was still using hunting rifles to fight, but today they are using machine guns and mortars to deal with the French colonialists.

Reports indicate that 10,000 French Air Force personnel have been reorganized into ground troops and sent to Algeria to replenish the French forces depleted in the Algerian war.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th dispatch from Rabat: The headquarters of the Moroccan "Saharan Liberation Army" issued a statement today, condemning the French and Spanish armies for their recent joint military operations in El Aaiún and Smara in the Western Sahara region, and for killing more than 600 peaceful local residents.

The statement said that the French and Spanish armies also used poison gas on the grasslands where livestock were grazing during this joint "sweep."

    阿解放军痛歼法军
    撒哈拉解放军谴责法西两国军队狼狈为奸
    新华社26日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军过去两天中继续同法国殖民军进行激烈战斗。24日及25日两天在塔布拉、阿克布、苏玛河谷和坦内斯附近的四次较大战役中，一共打死打伤了法军九十三名，生俘三名。
    在民族解放军越来越强大的打击下，连法国殖民军的高级军官、伞兵上校比舍阿也不得不悲哀地承认，“时间”对阿尔及利亚人民有利。他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军一年前还使用猎枪来作战，而今天他们已用机枪和迫击炮来对付法国殖民者。
    有消息说，一万名法国空军军人被改编为地面部队派往阿尔及利亚，来补充在阿尔及利亚战争中受到损失的法军。
    新华社26日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥“撒哈拉解放军”司令部今天发表声明，谴责法国军队同西班牙军队最近在西撒哈拉地区的阿尤恩和斯马拉采取联合军事行动，并且杀害当地和平居民六百多人。
    声明说，法、西两国军队在这次联合“扫荡”战中还曾经在放牧牲口的草原施放毒气。
