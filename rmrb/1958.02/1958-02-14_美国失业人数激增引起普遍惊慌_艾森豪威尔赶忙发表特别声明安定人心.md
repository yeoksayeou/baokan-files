Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 13th: The recession in U.S. economic activity and the rapid growth of the unemployed population have developed to such a serious extent that even President Eisenhower needs to issue a statement to reassure the people.

    Eisenhower issued a statement on the U.S. economic situation on the 12th. In his statement, he tried to alleviate the widespread panic caused by the U.S. Department of Commerce's material released on the 11th regarding the sharp increase in unemployment in January of this year. The Commerce Department's figures said that the number of unemployed in January of this year increased to 4.49 million, an increase of 1.12 million from December of last year, reaching the highest record in eight years.

    In his statement, Eisenhower acknowledged that "the January unemployment figures indicate that the current economic decline is more intense than is normal for this time of year." To reassure people, Eisenhower boasted that the current decline is not of a long-term nature, and he said: "In March (this year), we will see the unemployment situation begin to improve."

    Eisenhower put forward a plan to "support the restoration of economic activity," one of which is to greatly increase military procurement contracts using the old method of quenching thirst with poison. According to this plan, in the 1958 fiscal year, the U.S. government will increase the cost of military procurement contracts from $17.8 billion last year to $23.6 billion. He said that this would increase employment in many industrial areas.

    Eisenhower's plan also stipulates easing credit to stimulate housing construction and increasing public works expenditures. He mentioned that the government will increase the cost of building highways from $1.77 billion in the 1958 fiscal year to $2.38 billion in the 1959 fiscal year, and increase the cost of other public works from $1.73 billion in the 1958 fiscal year to $1.97 billion. In addition, Eisenhower also said that he would submit to the U.S. Congress a plan to modernize the postal service, according to which the U.S. government will spend $2 billion in the next three to five years.

    The U.S. President also requested that the lending power of the Export-Import Bank be increased by $2 billion to expand exports in order to shift the U.S. economic difficulties to other capitalist countries.

    After Eisenhower's statement was issued, many U.S. economists immediately expressed their disagreement with Eisenhower's view that the decline in U.S. economic activity would end in March.

    Nadier, an economist at "Hanover Bank and Trust Company," said he doubted that industrial employment would begin to increase in March of this year. He said: "Until now, the government has talked more and done less."

    Retail trade expert Zeromick believes that this economic recession will not recover as quickly as in 1954, especially for employment.

    Democratic senators in the Senate have called for emergency measures to alleviate unemployment.

    美国失业人数激增引起普遍惊慌
    艾森豪威尔赶忙发表特别声明安定人心
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国经济活动的衰退和失业人口的急剧增长已经发展到如此严重的程度，甚至需要总统艾森豪威尔出面发表一项声明来安定人心了。
    艾森豪威尔在12日就美国的经济情况发表了一篇声明。他在声明中力图缓和美国商务部11日发表的今年1月份失业人数急遽增加的材料所引起的普遍惊恐。商务部的数字说，今年1月份失业人数增加到四百四十九万人，比去年12月增加了一百一十二万人，达到八年来的最高纪录。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中承认“1月份的失业数字表明目前的经济下降比通常一年中的这个时间来得激烈”。为了安慰人心，艾森豪威尔扬言目前的下降不具有长期性质，他并且说：“在（今年）3月将会看到失业情况开始好转”。
    艾森豪威尔提出了一个“支持经济活动恢复”的计划，其中有一项就是用饮鸩止渴的老办法，大大增加军事采购合同。根据这项计划，在1958年年度，美国政府将把军事采购合同的费用从去年的一百七十八亿美元增加到二百三十六亿美元。他表示，这将会增加许多工业地区的就业。
    艾森豪威尔的计划还规定放宽信贷以刺激房屋建筑和增加公共工程费用等。他提到，政府将把用于建筑公路的费用从1958财政年度的十七亿七千万美元增加到1959财政年度的二十三亿八千万美元，把其他公共工程的费用从1958财政年度的十七亿三千万美元增加到十九亿七千万美元。此外，艾森豪威尔还说，他将向美国国会提出一项使邮政事业现代化的计划，根据这项计划，美国政府在今后三到五年内将支出二十亿美元。
    美国总统还要求把进出口银行的贷款权力增加二十亿美元来扩大输出，以便把美国的经济困难转嫁给其他资本主义国家。
    艾森豪威尔的声明发表后，美国许多经济学家立即表示不同意艾森豪威尔关于美国经济活动的下降将在3月终止的意见。
    “汉诺弗银行和信托公司”经济学家纳德勒说，他怀疑在今年3月工业就业人数会开始增加。他说：“直到目前，政府说得多、做得少。”
    零售贸易专家泽洛米克认为，这一次经济衰退不会像1954年那样快地恢复，对就业来说特别是如此。
    参议院的民主党议员们要求采取紧急措施来缓和失业现象。
