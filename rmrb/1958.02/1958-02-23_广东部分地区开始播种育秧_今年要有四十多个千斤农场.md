    Parts of Guangdong Begin Sowing and Nursing Seedlings
    This Year There Will Be More Than Forty "Thousand-Catty Farms"

    (Our Dispatch) Guangdong Province has forty-one special and county demonstration farms that aim to achieve "thousand-catty" yields of rice this year. They also plan to raise 40,000 pigs, doubling last year's number, and strive to accumulate 770,000 yuan in funds for the state. Currently, these farms have already begun preparing for spring plowing ahead of schedule. Some farms in the Chaoshan area and the Leizhou Peninsula have already started sowing and nursing seedlings, about five days earlier than last year.

    Last year, Guangdong Province already had twenty-three "thousand-catty rice farms." Among them, the Chenghai County Demonstration Farm had the highest yield, averaging 1,454 catties per mu. In the nationally renowned high-yield grain area of Chaoshan Prefecture, "thousand-catty farms" accounted for eleven out of fourteen farms. The natural conditions of the farms in various places are not very good, but due to the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas displayed by the staff, they have repaired water conservancy facilities, implemented soil improvement, carefully selected good seeds, and adopted various advanced measures, turning many low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields. For example, the Kuigang Demonstration Farm in Sanshui County had 107 mu of rice fields, which were perennially waterlogged and had heavy, sticky, and barren soil in the past. However, the staff personally built dikes and embankments to drain the waterlogging, and also applied 300 dan of pond mud per mu and returned all rice stalks to the field. As a result, all the rice fields were transformed into deep, soft, and fertile fields, increasing from an average of 724 catties per mu in 1953 to 1,004 catties in 1957.

    The advanced deeds of the "thousand-catty farms" in various prefectures and counties have aroused great interest among farmers. Farmers often visit these farms to observe and learn. According to statistics, more than 150,000 farmers visit these farms every year. Furthermore, farmers in various places have adopted a total of more than 18 million catties of improved rice varieties bred on the farms, such as "Baigu Nuo No. 16" and "Boli Zhan." These improved varieties can generally increase production by about 10%.

    The province currently has a total of 102 special and county farms. Due to the continuous improvement of management and operation, many farms have achieved surpluses, showing a thriving trend and demonstrating the superiority of the socialist agricultural economy.

### 广东部分地区开始播种育秧  今年要有四十多个千斤农场

    广东部分地区开始播种育秧
    今年要有四十多个千斤农场
    本报讯　广东省今年有四十一个专、县示范农场要实现水稻千斤场，要饲养生猪四万头，比去年增加一倍，并且争取为国家积累资金七十七万元。现在，这些农场已经提早进行春耕准备工作，潮汕地区和雷州半岛有些农场已经开始播种育秧，比去年提早五天左右。
    广东省去年已经出现了二十三个水稻千斤场，其中以澄海县示范农场的产量最高，平均每亩有一千四百五十四斤，著名全国的粮食高产地区潮汕专区十四个农场中，千斤场就占了十一个。各地农场的自然条件并不是很好的，但由于场内职工们用移山倒海的气概，修好了水利，实行土壤改良，精选良种和采取各种先进措施，使得许多低产田变成了高产田。例如三水县魁岗示范农场全场一百零七亩稻田，过去都是长年积水、粘质很重的瘦瘠田，但职工们亲手修筑堤围，排除渍水，又在每亩田上增施了三百担塘泥和全部经过稻秆回田，结果，使得全部稻田都变成深软的肥田，由1953年平均每亩七百二十四斤跃到1957年的一千零四斤。
    各专、县千斤农场的先进事迹引起农民很大兴趣，这些农场经常都有农民到场里去观摩学习，据统计，一年来到这些农场参观的农民约有十五万人以上。并且各地农民采取农场里繁育的“白谷糯16号”、“玻璃粘”等优良稻种共有一千八百多万斤，这些良种普遍都能增产一成左右。
    全省现有专、县农场共一百零二个，这些农场由于不断改善经营管理，有许多场已经得到盈余，表现得蒸蒸日上之势，显示了社会主义农业经济的优越性。
