    The heroic Soviet Army, from the day it was born in the flames of the great October Socialist Revolution, has traversed a glorious path of brilliant achievements for forty years. It has made outstanding contributions in defending the Soviet state, defending the cause of socialism, and defending the cause of world peace. All peace-loving people around the world hold infinite admiration and heartfelt gratitude for the Soviet Army's great contribution to the just cause of humanity. Today, as this new type of socialist army celebrates its 40th anniversary, the Chinese people, together with the Soviet people and all peace-loving people, celebrate this glorious festival with infinite excitement and extend warm congratulations to the glorious Soviet people and the glorious Soviet Army.
    The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution shocked the world. The imperialist countries were both fearful and hateful of the first socialist country in the world, and from the very beginning wanted to strangle it in its cradle. Faced with this grave situation, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, established their own glorious army. This people's army, guided by Marxist-Leninist ideology and possessing a high degree of revolutionary will, demonstrated an unstoppable sharpness from the very beginning. It overcame all difficulties with inferior equipment and finally completely crushed the armed intervention launched by fourteen imperialist countries, including Britain, the United States, and France, and the frenzied offensive of domestic counter-revolutionary forces, heroically defended the achievements of the October Revolution, consolidated the Soviet regime, and ensured the reliable growth and development of the first young socialist country.
    Born in the flames of the Great October Revolution and growing stronger in the domestic war, the Soviet Army was once again subjected to a severe test of war in the Soviet people's great Patriotic War. In the summer of 1941, the German fascist army, with its superior strength and equipment, perfidiously launched a sudden attack on the Soviet Union. In the difficult days of the early war, the Soviet army heroically conducted strategic defense, resisting the fascist army's offensive at every turn. However, the heroic Soviet Army, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, and with the support of the entire Soviet people, quickly shifted from strategic retreat to local counter-offensives, and then from local counter-offensives to strategic counter-offensives, completely defeating the powerful German fascist army, and subsequently annihilating the most elite Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism in the Far East, achieving a complete victory in the anti-fascist war. The glorious victory of the Soviet people and their army defended the Soviet state, defended human civilization, and helped the people of many countries in Europe and Asia to gain liberation. After World War II, a series of new socialist countries were born, and a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union was formed.
    The heroic history of the Soviet Army's victories fully demonstrates the great combat power of the working class's army under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Soviet Army is built on the foundation of the Soviet state system and the socialist system, on the foundation of the high revolutionary consciousness of the entire Soviet working people, and enjoys the support of the entire Soviet people and the progressive people of the world, and thus can be invincible and unstoppable.
    In the post-war period, the Soviet Army has continued to make great contributions to defending the cause of socialism and world peace. The existence of a powerful Soviet Army itself is a warning to the imperialist warmongers. The Soviet Army, together with the people's armies of the socialist camp, jointly defend the security of the countries of the socialist camp, enabling these countries to carry out the peaceful construction of socialism smoothly. In the Hungarian incident, the Soviet Army, with its great proletarian internationalist spirit, helped the Hungarian people crush the counter-revolutionary rebellion and defended Hungary's independence, freedom, and socialist cause. The existence of the Soviet Army is also one of the major factors in stopping the war of aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and curbing the conspiracy of US imperialism to ignite a new war in Syria. These facts all show that the powerful Soviet Army is a reliable defender of world peace and a faithful friend of all oppressed peoples and peace-loving people.
    Because the Soviet Communist Party is constantly strengthening political work in the Soviet Army, educating the troops with the principles of Marxism-Leninism and with the spirit of internationalism and patriotism; and because the Soviet Army possesses the richest combat experience and the most modern technical equipment, the Soviet Army has become the most powerful and most combat-effective revolutionary army in the world. The existence of a powerful Soviet Army encourages the efforts of the people of the socialist camp to engage in peaceful construction, encourages the struggles of the people of all oppressed nations to win independence and freedom, and encourages the struggles of the people of all countries to safeguard peace. The powerful Soviet Army is a pillar of world peace.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army have a deep combat friendship. This friendship is built on the ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism and on the foundation of the common cause of defending socialism and world peace. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has learned from the advanced experience of Soviet army building, learned from the rich combat experience and advanced military technology of the Soviet Army, and has now developed into a powerful armed force for defending the socialist cause and defending world peace. Now, the great unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is developing day by day, and the combat friendship between the two armies is also constantly strengthening. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will always stand firmly with the Soviet people and the Soviet Army, and will work together to defend the common cause of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to defend the cause of peace throughout the world.

### 英雄的苏联军队是世界和平的支柱

    英雄的苏联军队是世界和平的支柱
    英雄的苏联军队，从它在伟大的十月社会主义革命的烈火中诞生的那一天起，四十年来经历了战绩辉煌的光荣道路。它在保卫苏维埃国家，保卫社会主义事业和保卫世界和平事业方面，建立了卓越的功勋。全世界一切爱好和平的人民对苏联军队对于人类正义事业的伟大贡献怀着无限的敬佩和衷心的感激。今天，当这支新型的社会主义军队建军四十周年之际，中国人民同苏联人民以及一切爱好和平人民一起，以无限兴奋的心情欢庆这个光辉的节日，并向光荣的苏联人民和光荣的苏联军队表示热烈的祝贺。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利震惊了全世界。帝国主义国家对世界上第一个诞生的社会主义国家，既畏惧，又仇恨，一开始就想把它扼死在襁褓中。面对着这种严重的形势，苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导之下建立了自己的光荣的军队。这支以马克思列宁主义思想为指导的、具有高度革命意志的人民军队，在成立之初，就表现出锐不可当的锋芒。它以劣势的装备，克服一切困难，终于彻底粉碎了英、美、法等十四个帝国主义国家发动的武装干涉和国内反革命势力的猖狂进攻，英勇地保卫了十月革命的成果，巩固了苏维埃政权，使第一个年轻的社会主义国家的成长和发展得到了可靠的保证。
    在伟大十月革命的战火中诞生的、在国内战争中成长壮大的苏联军队，在苏联人民伟大的卫国战争中，再一次受到了严重的战争考验。1941年夏天，德国法西斯军队挟其优势的兵力和装备，背信弃义地突然向苏联发动进攻。战争初期的艰难的日子里，苏联军队英勇地进行战略防御，节节抗击法西斯军队的进攻。然而，英雄的苏联军队，在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导之下，在苏联全体人民的支持之下，很快就从战略退却转入局部反攻，接着又从局部反攻转入战略反攻，彻底打败了强大的德国法西斯军队，随后又在远东歼灭了日本帝国主义最精锐的关东军，反法西斯战争取得了完全的胜利。苏联人民及其军队的光辉的胜利，保卫了苏维埃国家，保卫了人类的文明，并且帮助了欧洲和亚洲的许多国家的人民获得解放。在第二次世界大战后，一系列的新的社会主义国家诞生了，以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营形成了。
    苏联军队从胜利走向胜利的英雄历史，充分证明了在共产党领导下的工人阶级的军队具有伟大的战斗力。苏联军队建立在苏维埃国家制度和社会主义制度的基础之上，建立在苏联全体劳动人民的高度革命觉悟的基础之上，得到全体苏联人民和世界进步人类的支持，因而能够战无不胜，所向无敌。
    在战后时期里，苏联军队继续为保卫社会主义事业和世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。强大的苏联军队的存在本身就是对帝国主义好战分子的警告。苏联军队同社会主义阵营各国人民军队一起，共同捍卫着社会主义阵营各国的安全，使这些国家得以顺利地进行社会主义的和平建设。在匈牙利事件中，具有伟大无产阶级国际主义精神的苏联军队，帮助匈牙利人民粉碎了反革命叛乱，保卫了匈牙利的独立、自由和社会主义事业。苏联军队的存在，也是制止英、法和以色列侵略埃及的战争和遏止美帝国主义在叙利亚燃起新战火的阴谋的重大因素之一。这些事实都说明，强大的苏联军队是世界和平的可靠的保卫者，是一切被压迫民族人民和爱好和平人民的忠实的朋友。
    由于苏联共产党在苏联军队中不断地加强政治工作，以马克思列宁主义的原则、以国际主义和爱国主义的精神教育部队；由于苏联军队拥有最丰富的战斗经验和最现代化的技术装备，苏联军队已经成为世界上最强大的、最具有战斗威力的革命军队。强大的苏联军队的存在，鼓舞了社会主义阵营各国人民从事和平建设的努力，鼓舞了各被压迫民族人民争取独立自由的斗争，鼓舞了各国人民维护和平的斗争。强大的苏联军队是世界和平事业的支柱。
    中国人民解放军和苏联军队有着深厚的战斗友谊。这种友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义的思想基础上，建立在保卫社会主义、世界和平的共同事业的基础上的。中国人民解放军在中国共产党的领导下，在长期的革命战争中，学习了苏联建军的先进经验，学习了苏联军队的丰富的战斗经验和先进的军事技术，现在已经发展成为一支强大的保卫社会主义事业和保卫世界和平的武装力量。现在，中苏两国人民之间的伟大团结正日益发展，两国军队之间的战斗友谊也正不断地加强。中国人民和中国人民解放军将永远坚定地同苏联人民和苏联军队在一起，为保卫以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的共同事业，为保卫全世界的和平事业，共同奋斗。
