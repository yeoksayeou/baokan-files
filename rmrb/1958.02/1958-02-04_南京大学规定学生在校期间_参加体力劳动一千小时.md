Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd. Nanjing University recently stipulated that undergraduate students must participate in at least 1,000 hours of physical labor during their period of study at the university.

During the rectification campaign, Nanjing University exposed and criticized the tendency among students to look down upon physical labor. Students universally requested the establishment of a labor system. Now, the school stipulates that students, in addition to receiving labor education in the classroom, must devote a certain amount of time each week to engage in on-campus and off-campus voluntary labor, take turns being responsible for the cleaning and sanitation of public places such as dormitories, classrooms, and laboratories, contract to take responsibility for the greening and campus construction within the school, and make contact with agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs for labor in the countryside on Sundays. During winter and summer vacations, they must participate in agricultural labor in the countryside for a period of time. The school will also organize work-study production activities, such as raising pigs, grinding tofu, and growing vegetables, based on possible conditions, to ensure that no water is left unused and no land is left uncultivated on campus.

　　南京大学规定学生在校期间
    参加体力劳动一千小时
    据新华社南京3日电　南京大学最近规定本科学生在校学习期间必须至少参加体力劳动一千小时。
    南京大学在整改期间，揭发和批判了学生中轻视体力劳动的思想和作风，学生普遍要求建立劳动制度。现在学校规定学生除在课堂接受劳动教育外，每星期要抽出一定时间从事校内和校外义务劳动，轮流负责宿舍、教室、实验室等公共场所的清洁卫生打扫工作，分工包干学校内的绿化和校园建设，并和郊区农业社联系，星期日下乡劳动。寒假暑假期间，要到农村参加一个时期的农业劳动。学校还根据可能条件，组织勤工俭学的生产活动，如养猪，磨豆腐，种菜，做到校内水不闲、地不空。
