I have listened to Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on language reform. I fully support them and will implement them in my future work. Now, I will report to the conference on the production situation of our cooperative.

Drought Cannot Scare the Young "July 1st Cooperative": We Have Achieved Consecutive Years of Increased Production and Income

I am from the "July 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Quanxian County, Guangxi. Our agricultural cooperative has many mountains and ridges within its borders, with more dry land than paddy fields, and poor soil and water conservancy. It is truly: "A good white field cave, water moving underground, three days of sunshine, men and women are all busy (with drought resistance)." Although the natural conditions are not so good, in recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and like our brother cooperatives across the country, we have continuously overcome difficulties and conquered the consecutive years of drought in production. Because no difficulty can scare our young "July 1st" Cooperative, on the contrary, it has tempered us. In recent years, we have still achieved consecutive years of increased production and income. Rice, in 1956, averaged 466 jin per mu, and in 1957, it reached 620 jin per mu (including miscellaneous grains), an increase of more than 30 percent. Peanuts, in 1956, only yielded an average of 130 jin per mu, and in 1957, the average income was more than 247 jin per mu, an increase of 90 percent. In 1956, each household averaged only one pig, and in 1957, after slaughtering for their own use and selling to the state, each household still averaged three pigs. Due to the increase in production last year, the total income of agricultural and sideline products of the entire cooperative increased by 18 percent compared with 1956. Adding the income from sideline occupations of the members' families, the average income per person in the entire cooperative was 115 yuan, which is more than 25 yuan higher than the average annual income per person of the local wealthy middle peasants in the past. On the basis of the improvement of the living standards of the members, public accumulation has been expanded. The current public accumulation has increased from 11,000 yuan in 1956 to 24,000 yuan in 1957.

The main measures for the year-by-year increase in production of our cooperative are to build water conservancy projects and transform dry land into paddy fields. In the past three years, the entire cooperative has built a total of 25 mountain ponds and reservoirs, 8 dams, 6 kilometers of ditches, and dug 24 wells, basically eliminating drought in the original 1,500 mu of dry land, and converting more than 150 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In the past, only one crop could be planted, but now two crops can be planted.

This Year, the Output Per Mu Will Be 1,000 Jin, Each Household Will Raise Nine Pigs, and the Average Income Per Person Will Reach 230 Yuan

After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program, everyone was very happy. The entire cooperative launched a great airing of views, a great debate, and a big debate on the National Agricultural Development Program. After the debate, the enthusiasm for socialist revolution soared to an unprecedented height. Everyone unanimously believed that the production in the past few years has been developing year by year, but the rate of increase is still very slow. It was a small leap forward, and this year we must have a great leap forward. Every member is full of confidence and wants to over fulfill the target of 800 jin per mu set by the National Agricultural Development Program this year. Therefore, the entire cooperative plans to increase the average yield of rice from 620 jin per mu in 1957 to 1,000 jin per mu this year, an increase of 60 percent compared with 1957; sweet potatoes from 1,700 jin per mu to 5,000 jin per mu; peanuts from 247 jin per mu to 450 jin per mu, an increase of more than 90 percent compared with 1957; this year, each household will raise an average of nine pigs, an increase of six pigs per household compared with 1957, an increase of two times; sideline production will increase by more than 35 percent compared with 1957. The general requirements are: 1,000 jin of grain per mu, nine pigs per household, and an average income of 230 yuan per person.

Water Conservancy Construction and Manure Accumulation Movement are in Full Swing: This Year We Will Eliminate Drought and Achieve Full Water Conservancy in the Entire Cooperative

In order to complete this plan, the entire cooperative has launched a vigorous movement of water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. The members said: "One year of hard work, ten years of happiness, ten years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness." We must eliminate drought this year and achieve full water conservancy in the entire cooperative. The water conservancy project we are currently building can irrigate more than 20,000 mu. This water conservancy project is 30 kilometers long and must pass through two stone mountains. The stone volume is nearly 10,000 cubic meters, but there are only two stonemasons in the cooperative. What should we do? Young people voluntarily signed up to learn stonemasonry. After 30 days of hard study day and night, the water conservancy project was completed, and they also learned stonemasonry. In this way, our cooperative originally had only two stonemasons, but now there are more than 40 who can do stonemasonry. They said: "Nothing is difficult in the world, as long as you put your heart into it." The water conservancy project we built was originally planned to take 50 days, but it only took 30 days to complete. The elderly said that this water conservancy project was proposed 200 years ago, but it has never been able to be built. Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party, we have realized it. Everyone is very happy and said: "Now we are not afraid of drought, even if it does not rain, we can guarantee increased production and income." While building water conservancy projects, we are also vigorously carrying out manure accumulation movement, planning to apply 200 dan of fertilizer per mu this year, twice as much as last year. Last winter, we had already accumulated 60 dan of fertilizer per mu. With the manure accumulation movement this spring, this manure accumulation plan is not only guaranteed to be completed but also over fulfilled. In addition, we are also actively carrying out soil improvement, selecting superior varieties, and promoting various advanced production technologies, etc., to ensure a great leap forward in production in 1958 in many ways.

    过去小跃进  今年大跃进
    蒋在球代表报告广西省全县“七一”农业社的生产干劲
    我听了李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一五九八年国家预算草案的报告”、薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划的报告”和彭真副委员长关于常务委员会的工作报告以及吴玉章主任关于文字改革的报告，我完全拥护，并今后在工作中贯彻执行。现在我将我们社的生产情况，向大会汇报一下。
    旱灾吓不倒年轻的“七一社”  我们做到了连年增产又增收
    我是广西全县“七一”农业社的，我们的农业社，境内多山多岭，旱田多、水田少，土质水利都很坏，真是：“好个白田洞，水在地下动，晴得三天来，男女都不空（要抗旱）。”虽然自然条件不那么好，但几年来，我们在党和政府的领导下，和全国各地的兄弟社一样，在生产中不断的克服了困难，战胜了连年来的旱灾。因为任何困难都不能够把我们年轻的“七一”社吓倒，相反的锻炼了我们，在几年来，还是连年增产增收。水稻，一九五六年平均亩产四百六十六斤，一九五七年达到了六百二十斤（包括杂粮），增产百分之三十多；花生，一九五六年每亩平均只产一百三十斤，一九五七年每亩平均收入二百四十七斤多，增产百分之九十；生猪，一九五六年每户平均只有一头，一九五七年除去自宰和卖给国家外，每户还平均有三头。由于去年生产增加，全社农副业总收入比一九五六年增长了百分之十八；加上社员的家庭副业收入，全社每人平均收入一百一十五元，和过去当地富裕中农每人每年平均收入比起来，还超过了二十五元。在社员生活水平提高的基础上，扩大了公共积累。现在的公共积累，已由一九五六年一万一千元增加到一九五七年二万四千元。
    我们社的生产逐年得到增产，主要措施是兴修水利和旱地变水田。全社在三年中共修了山塘水库二十五处，水坝八处，水沟六公里，打井二十四个；使原来一千五百多亩的旱田，基本上消灭了旱灾，把一百五十多亩旱地，改变成了水田，过去只种一造的，现在能种两造了。
    今年亩产千斤每户养猪九头  每人平均收入达二百三十元
    全国农业发展纲要公布后，大家很高兴，全社就对农业发展纲要展开了大鸣大放大辩论，辩论后，社会主义革命干劲空前高涨，一致认为，过去几年的生产连年都有发展，但增产的速度还是很慢的，是一个小跃进，今年要来一个大跃进。每个社员信心百倍，要在今年超额完成全国农业发展纲要亩产八百斤的指标，因此全社计划今年水稻平均每亩由一九五七年的每亩六百二十斤提高到亩产一千斤，比一九五七年增产百分之六十；红薯由每亩产一千七百斤提高到五千斤；花生由每亩产二百四十七斤提高到四百五十斤，比一九五七年增产百分之九十以上；今年每户平均养猪九头，比一九五七年每户增加六头，增产二倍；副业生产都要比一九五七年增加百分之三十五以上。总的要求是：亩产千斤粮，每户九头猪，每人平均二百三十元的收入。
    兴修水利积肥运动热火朝天  今年要消灭旱灾全社水利化
    为了完成这个计划，全社已热火朝天的开展了兴修水利和积肥运动。社员们说：“一年辛苦，十年幸福，十年辛苦，万年幸福。”要在今年消灭旱灾，全社水利化。我们现在修的一条水利，能灌溉二万多亩，这条水利全长三十公里，要经过两个石山岭，石方将近一万方，但社里只有两个会石工的，怎么办呢？青壮年就自动报名去学石工，他们经过三十天不分日夜的苦学，水利修通了，石工也学会了，这样我们社原来只有两个会石工的，现在已经有四十多个会做石工了。他们说：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，我们所修的这条水利，原计划需要五十天的时间，结果只花了三十天的时间就修通了。听老年人说：这条水利在二百年前曾有人提过，但一直无法修起，现在有了共产党领导我们实现了。大家都很高兴地说：“现在不怕天旱了，就是不下雨也能保证增产增收。”我们在修好水利的同时，还大力开展积肥运动，计划今年每亩下肥二百担，比去年增加两倍，去年冬天我们已经积到每亩有了六十担肥料，再加上今年春季积肥运动，这个积肥计划，不但有把握完成而且还会超额完成。此外，我们还在积极的开展改良土壤，选择优良品种和推广各项先进生产技术等工作，从多方面来保证一九五八年生产大跃进。
