    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 24th - The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today supporting the joint statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments regarding the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from North Korea. It also demanded that the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea also withdraw their troops from South Korea.
    The statement pointed out that the joint statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments provided many new and significant possibilities for resolving the Korean reunification issue and consolidating peace in Korea and the Far East. However, the United States has repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement by transporting war materials, and even atomic weapons, into South Korea, creating tension in Korea and the Far East.
    The statement pointed out that Korea is still in a state of division, and peace in Korea is seriously threatened, which is entirely caused by the United States. If the US government uses this as an excuse not to withdraw its troops stationed in South Korea, it will surely be severely condemned by the people of the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 24th - The joint statement of the Chinese and North Korean governments regarding the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has been warmly welcomed by the All-India Peace Council. In a statement issued here this morning, the All-India Peace Council said: The People's Republic of China has once again proved that it earnestly hopes to contribute all its strength to the cause of easing international tensions and to the peace and stability of Asia.

    越南民主共和国政府
    支持中朝两国联合声明
    新华社河内24日电　越南民主共和国政府今天发表声明，支持中朝两国政府关于从朝鲜撤退中国人民志愿军的联合声明，同时要求美国和其他在南朝鲜驻有军队的国家也把他们的军队撤出南朝鲜。
    声明指出，中朝两国政府的联合声明为解决朝鲜统一问题以及巩固朝鲜和远东的和平提供了许多新的巨大的可能性。但是，美国却屡次违反朝鲜停战协定，把战争物资、甚至原子武器运入南朝鲜，在朝鲜和远东地区制造紧张局势。
    声明指出，目前朝鲜仍然处于分裂状态，朝鲜的和平受到严重的威胁，这完全是美国所造成的。如果美国政府借故不撤退他们驻在南朝鲜的军队，他们一定会受到全世界人民的严厉谴责。
    据新华社新德里24日电　中朝两国政府关于中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的联合声明受到了全印和平理事会的热烈欢迎。全印和平理事会今天上午在这里发表的一篇声明中说：中华人民共和国再一次证明，它恳切地希望对缓和国际紧张局势的事业和对亚洲的和平和稳定贡献出自己的一切力量。
