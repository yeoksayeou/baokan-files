Our Country's Steel Industry Has a Bright Future

Comrade Xia Yikun believes that to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, the following important work needs to be done: 1. Do a good job in coal and iron resource exploration; 2. Research electric ironmaking; 3. Research and design continuous casting devices; 4. Strengthen the design work of rolling mill equipment; 5. Promote oxygen steelmaking; 6. Cooperate with nitrogen fertilizer plants as much as possible to use coke oven gas to produce fertilizer; 7. Explore resources such as nickel and chromium; 8. We must implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift; 9. We must closely cooperate with other industrial and agricultural production; 10. Criticize all conservative ideas.

I completely agree with Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the implementation of the 1957 national budget and the 1958 draft national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the 1958 draft national economic plan, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report on the current work of writing reform and the Chinese phonetic alphabet, and I suggest that the Congress approve them.

During the first five-year plan period, under the correct leadership of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao, our country launched a great upsurge in industrial and agricultural production throughout the country. Thanks to the selfless labor of the working people across the country and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we successfully overfulfilled the arduous and glorious tasks and laid the socialist economic foundation of our country. This year, we will continue to carry out a greater and higher-speed national socialist construction with full confidence on the basis of the great victory of last year's rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle.

In the 1958 national budget, we saw a large increase in economic construction investment and a large reduction in national defense expenditures and administrative management costs, which fully demonstrates our country's determination to build peace and implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. This is entirely in line with the interests of the peace-loving working people of the world.

The report also mentioned the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer, which made us engaged in the steel industry feel extremely excited and express our heartfelt support. I would like to talk about my opinions on the steel industry and ask the representatives to correct me.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our country basically did not have any steel industry. In the early days of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Anshan Iron and Steel was completely destroyed. In the short eight years after liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the active efforts of the working masses, and the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, restoration and expansion work was carried out. Our country's steel production is developing at a high speed. During the first five-year plan period, the average annual increase rate was as high as 31.2%, and it reached an annual output of 5.24 million tons of steel in 1957. Britain is an ancient capitalist industrial country, and it has a history of more than 100 years in the development of the steel industry. According to statistics, in the sixteen years from 1941 to 1956, Britain's steel output increased from 12.51 million tons to 20.99 million tons, with an average annual increase rate of only 3.5%. There is a world of difference between our country and Britain in terms of steel production growth rate, which fully proves the absolute superiority of our country's socialist system. Due to the increasing decline of foreign markets in capitalist countries, on the other hand, they do not have an extremely large domestic market like our country and socialist countries, so economic crises often occur due to sluggish sales of products. In addition, Britain's coal and iron resources are extremely scarce, and most of them are poor mines, mainly relying on imports from abroad. Therefore, Britain's steel production growth rate will continue to decline, or even may have to reduce production. Even if it can maintain this growth rate, it is estimated that after fifteen years, the annual output of steel will be only more than 36 million tons. Our country has a large amount of coal and iron resources and a vast domestic market. In the future, due to the establishment of the heavy machinery manufacturing industry and the leap forward in the coal industry, our country's steel industry will be able to develop at a higher speed. Therefore, I think it is entirely possible and necessary to increase our country's steel production to more than 40 million tons per year within fifteen years. At the same time, we must point out that it is not without difficulties to achieve this great goal. We should take all important measures and make the greatest efforts to complete the glorious task given to us by the Party and the government.

During the second five-year plan period, the construction of our country's steel industry is mainly to complete or largely complete the construction of the three major steel bases and to put all other medium-sized steel plants into production. In addition, in order to meet the needs of local steel, several small and medium-sized steel plants will be established. The construction of large, medium and small steel plants is carried out simultaneously in a decentralized manner, so that various types of large and small steel products and alloy steel can basically meet the needs of industrial and agricultural construction in various departments of the country within five years. From then on, our country's steel industry will have a solid foundation. By that time, I think the steel output can be at least doubled or more than doubled compared to the end of 1957. Later, due to the continuous expansion of equipment manufacturing capacity, by the end of the fourth five-year plan period, our country will definitely be able to produce more than 40 million tons of steel. To achieve this high-speed development, I think it is necessary to do the following important work well:

1.  Do a good job in the exploration of coal and iron resources. After several years of general survey work on iron ore resources in our country, everyone generally believes that it is very rich. However, until now, the discovery of large-scale deposits is still relatively small, which is not very beneficial to the construction of large-scale steel plants. This exploration work takes a relatively long time, and the construction time of each large-scale steel plant is also relatively long. According to past experience, it takes about ten years from mineral exploration to the completion of plant construction. After having plant construction experience, the time can be shortened, but it may also take seven or eight years. Therefore, the exploration of iron ore should be prepared as soon as possible, otherwise it will delay the entire work. In Hubei Province, it is recommended to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the western Hubei iron ore as soon as possible. Regarding the mining of coking coal, the conditions are better in the north, but much worse in the south, so special attention should be paid to drilling, and at the same time, research should be conducted on the method of coking with low-grade coal.

2.  Research electric ironmaking. Our country's coking coal reserves, especially in the south, are not very large. Moreover, coal has a wider range of uses in the chemical industry. But on the other hand, our country's water resources are particularly abundant. If electric ironmaking is applied, the consumption of coke can be saved by more than half. Therefore, it is possible to reasonably promote electric ironmaking. At present, the application of electric ironmaking in the world is still limited to small-scale, so it is necessary to conduct research and design work in this area, so as to carry out the construction of electric ironmaking equipment during the third or fourth five-year plan period.

3.  Research and design continuous casting devices. Although the current continuous casting device is still limited to small and medium-sized and special steel, it is gradually turning to large-scale. We should focus on research and key experiments, so that it can be applied to large-scale steel plants in the near future. In this way, the complex and heavy primary rolling mill equipment can be saved, construction investment can be saved, and the construction time can be shortened accordingly.

4.  Strengthen the design work of rolling mill equipment. In steel plants, rolling mill equipment accounts for the largest number, and most of them are non-standard equipment with relatively complex structures. The domestic design force for this equipment is still relatively weak. Therefore, it is best to train an appropriate number of design talents in heavy machinery manufacturing plants, and to appropriately conduct research and experiments on rolling technology in professional schools and research institutions, so that the immature rolling theory can be combined with practice, so that the performance of the equipment and the quality of the steel can be further improved, and construction investment can also be saved.

5.  Promote oxygen steelmaking. Using pure oxygen steelmaking in converters can improve quality and simplify equipment, and production can also be increased. Using oxygen steelmaking in open hearth furnaces can also increase production and reduce equipment and plant investment. Therefore, it is advisable to promote oxygen steelmaking in the construction of steel plants, reduce construction investment, and shorten construction time.

6.  Make full use of coke oven gas and nitrogen fertilizer plants to cooperate in the production of fertilizer. Although this adds trouble to the design of steel plants, it is of great significance in supporting agriculture. At the same time, oxygen can be supplied from the nitrogen fertilizer plant, reducing the construction investment of the oxygen plant.

7.  Explore resources such as nickel and chromium. In industrial construction, the application of high and low alloy steel is increasing. Therefore, the consumption of nickel and chromium is also increasing. Our country has very few discoveries of these metal resources at present. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct exploration as soon as possible to meet the needs of alloy steel smelting. On the other hand, we must also study alternative alloys.

8.  When building steel enterprises, we must implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift. In the construction of the steel industry, a large amount of national investment is required. Now our country's economic foundation is still very weak. Therefore, on the premise of not affecting production requirements, we should try to reduce various standards as much as possible, especially auxiliary facilities and living welfare parts, and we should save a lot and delete unnecessary items. Projects that can be postponed should also be postponed, so that these investments can be transferred to more urgently needed construction projects, so as to complete our country's socialist construction cause as soon as possible. In the process of implementing saving measures in the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, according to incomplete estimates, it can save more than 200 million yuan of national investment, which is of great significance to our country's socialist economic construction. In the construction of small and medium-sized steel plants, it is completely possible and reasonable to greatly reduce the degree of mechanization and automation based on the condition that our country has an abundant labor force. In this way, a small amount of investment can be spent, and in a short period of time, many small and medium-sized steel plants can be built in various provinces and cities across the country to produce small and medium-sized steel products, which will play a major role in solving the urgent needs of steel across the country and localities.

9.  The construction of the steel industry must be closely coordinated with other industrial and agricultural production. The variety, quality and quantity of all products must meet the requirements of various industries. Special steel and alloys required by the automobile industry, aviation industry, chemical industry and military industry should be met with all efforts. In this way, our country can gradually have an independent and complete industrial system. For agricultural construction, we should provide supplies on the spot, regardless of whether they are scattered or in batches. Small steel plants in various places should especially meet the steel needs of agricultural water conservancy construction and agricultural tools, so as to form a great alliance between workers and peasants and move forward together towards the great goal of socialist construction.

10. Criticize all conservative ideas. We must fight against all difficulties, and we must consult with the masses when doing things. The success of the revolution completely depends on the wisdom and strength of the masses. We must show the revolutionary spirit, not be afraid of all difficulties, and criticize all Right-leaning and conservative ideas. This is a struggle between two roads. We firmly take the socialist road, obey the leadership of the Party, and wholeheartedly serve the people, so as to guarantee the completion of the task.

1958 is the first year of the second five-year plan for our country's socialist economic construction. We warmly respond to the call of the Party and the government to ensure that the production and construction of our country's steel industry overfulfills the task. In the Wuhan area, we guarantee that the No. 1 blast furnace of WISCO will be put into production by the end of this year. We are full of confidence that within fifteen years, our country's steel production will definitely exceed Britain on the condition of guaranteeing quality.

Finally, I wish the conference success.

　　我国钢铁工业前途远大
　　夏以焜代表认为要十五年赶上英国，需要作下列重要工作：1．做好煤铁资源勘探工作；2．研究电气炼铁；3．研究并设计连续铸锭装置；4．加强轧钢设备的设计工作；5．推行氧气炼钢；6．尽量利用焦炉煤气和氮肥厂合作，进行肥料的生产；7．勘探镍铬等金属的资源；8．必须贯彻勤俭建国的方针；9．要同其他工农业生产紧密配合；10．批判一切保守思想。
    我完全同意李先念副总理所作的关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算的报告，薄一波副总理所作的关于一九五八年国民经济计划草案的报告，以及吴玉章主任所作的关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案的报告，建议大会予以通过。
    在第一个五年计划期内，我国在党、政府和毛主席的正确领导下，掀起了在全国范围内的工农业生产大高潮，由于全国劳动人民的忘我劳动和苏联的无私援助，胜利地超额完成了艰巨而光荣的任务，奠定了我国的社会主义经济基础。今年我们将满怀信心，在去年的整风运动和反右派斗争伟大胜利的基础上，继续进行更伟大的和更高速度的国家的社会主义建设。
    在一九五八年的国家预算中，我们看到了经济建设投资的大量增加，国防经费和行政管理费用的大量缩减，完全表现了我国和平建设的决心和贯彻了勤俭建国的方针，这是完全符合全世界爱好和平的劳动人民的利益的。
    在报告中还提到了党中央和毛主席所提出的在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召，使我们从事钢铁工业者感到无比的兴奋，并表示衷心的拥护。我想在钢铁工业方面谈谈我的意见，请代表们予以指正。
    我国在国民党反动统治时期，根本上可以说没有办什么钢铁工业。在抗战胜利初期，鞍钢又被彻底破坏。在解放以后的短短八年内，由于党和政府的正确领导、劳动群众的积极努力和苏联的大力帮助，进行了恢复和扩建工作。我国钢的产量以高速度向前发展着，在第一个五年计划期间，每年的平均增产速度高达百分之三十一点二，到一九五七年已经达到年产钢五百二十四万吨。英国是一个古老的资本主义工业国，它在钢铁工业的发展方面，已有一百多年的历史，根据统计数字，从一九四一年到一九五六年十六年的时间内，英国钢的产量是自年产一千二百五十一万吨增加到年产二千零九十九万吨，平均年增产速度只是百分之三点五。我国和英国在钢的增产速度上，真是有天壤之别，这完全证明了我国社会主义制度的绝对优越性。由于资本主义国家的国外市场日益雕落，另一方面他们又不像我国和各社会主义国家拥有极其广大的国内市场，因此时常要因为产品滞销而发生经济危机。此外英国的煤铁资源极为贫乏，而且大部是贫矿，主要靠国外进口。因此英国钢的增产速度将有继续下降趋势，甚或可能还要减产。就是假设还能保持这种增产速度，到了十五年后，预计也不过年产钢三千六百余万吨。我国拥有大量的煤铁资源，并拥有广大的国内市场。今后并由于重型机械制造工业的建立和煤炭工业的跃进，我国的钢铁工业将能以更高的速度向前发展。因此我认为在十五年内把我国的钢铁产量提高到年产四千多万吨是完全可能的，而且也是必需的。同时我们一定要指出，要达到这个伟大目标不是没有困难的，我们应采取一切重要措施和作出最大的努力，来完成党和政府给予我们的光荣任务。
    在第二个五年计划期内，我国钢铁工业的建设，主要是完成或大部完成三大钢铁基地的建设以及使其他中型钢铁厂的全部投入生产。此外为了满足地方的钢铁需要，建立若干中小型钢铁厂。这样大型和中小型钢铁厂的建设分散地同时并进，使各种大小型钢材以及合金钢，在五年内基本上都能满足国家各部门工农业建设的需要，从此我国的钢铁工业就有了巩固的基础。到那个时候，我想钢铁的产量比一九五七年年底，至少可以增加一倍多到二倍。以后由于设备制造能力的不断壮大，到了第四个五年计划末期，我国一定能够生产四千多万吨钢铁了。要达到这种高速度的发展，我认为需要做好下列的重要工作：
    1、做好煤铁资源的勘探工作。我国的铁矿资源经过了几年来的普查工作，大家一致认为是非常丰富的。但直到现在为止，大型的矿藏发现的还比较少，这对建设大型钢铁厂是不太有利的。这项勘探工作需要的时间比较长，而每一座大型钢铁厂的建设时间又比较长。根据过去的经验，从探矿到建厂完成，大约需要十年工夫。以后有了建厂经验，时间可以缩短些，但可能也需要七八年。因此对铁矿的勘探工作，应及早准备，否则就要贻误全部工作。在湖北部分，建议对鄂西铁矿及早作全面的勘探工作。关于炼焦用煤的开采，在北方的条件较好，但在南方则比较差得多，应请特别注意钻探，同时并研究应用低级煤炼焦方法。
    2、研究电气炼铁。我国炼焦用煤，特别在南方，藏量不太多。且煤在化工方面，用途更广。但另一方面，我国水力资源特别丰富，如应用电气炼铁，焦炭的耗量，当可节省一半以上，因此有合理推广电气炼铁的可能。现在世界上对电气炼铁的应用仍限于小型，因此有必要进行该方面的研究和设计工作，以便在第三或第四个五年计划期间进行电气炼铁设备的建设。
    3、研究并设计连续铸锭装置。现在连续铸锭装置，虽仍限用于中小型和特殊钢方面，但有日渐转向大型的趋势。我们应当着重研究和重点试验，使能在不久的将来，应用到大型钢铁厂。这样就可省去繁复沉重的初轧机设备，节约建设投资，并使建设时间，相应缩短。
    4、加强对轧钢设备的设计工作。在钢铁厂内，轧钢设备占最大数量，且大部系非标准设备，构造亦较复杂，国内对该项设备的设计力量，还相当薄弱，因此最好在重型机械制造厂内培养适当数量的设计人才，并在专业学校和研究机构里适当地进行轧钢工艺的研究和试验工作，这样才能使幼稚的轧钢理论和实际相结合，使设备的性能和钢材的质量，更能提高，同时也可以节约建设投资。
    5、推行氧气炼钢。在转炉中使用纯氧炼钢，可以改进质量并使设备简化，产量亦有所增加。在平炉中使用氧气炼钢，亦可增加生产，减低设备和厂房投资。因此在钢铁厂的建设中宜推行氧气炼钢，减低建设投资，缩短建设时间。
    6、尽量利用焦炉煤气和氮肥厂合作，进行肥料的生产。这虽对钢铁厂的设计上增加麻烦，但在支援农业，有很大的意义。同时可以从氮肥厂供应氧气，减少氧气厂的建设投资。
    7、勘探镍铬等金属的资源。在工业建设中，高低合金钢的应用，日益增多。因此镍铬等的用量，亦有所上升。我国对这项金属的资源，在目前发现的很少。因此宜从速进行勘探，以满足合金钢冶炼的需要，另一方面还要研究代用的合金。
    8、在建设钢铁企业的时候，须贯彻勤俭建国的方针。在钢铁工业的建设中，需用国家的投资是很大的。现在我国的经济基础还是很薄弱，因此在不影响生产要求的前提下，应尽量降低各项标准，尤其是辅助设施和生活福利部分，更应大量节约，删去不必要的项目。可以暂缓建设的项目，亦应推迟施工，以便把这些投资，转移到更迫切需要的建设项目去，这样才能提早完成我国的社会主义建设事业。这次武汉钢铁联合企业进行节约措施的过程中，根据不完全的估计，约可节约国家投资二亿多，这对我国的社会主义经济建设，具有重大的意义。在中小型钢铁厂的建设中，根据我国具有充裕劳动力的条件下，大量地降低机械化和自动化程度，是完全可以的，而且也是合理的。这样就可以花很少的投资，在很短的时间内，在全国各省市建成很多的中小型钢铁厂，生产中小型钢材，这对解决全国和地方的钢铁迫切需要起重大的作用。
    9、钢铁工业的建设要和其他工农业生产做好紧密的配合。所有产品的品种、质量和数量，须适应各种工业的要求。如汽车工业、航空工业、化学工业以及军事工业所需用的特种钢料和合金，应当尽一切努力，设法满足，这样才能使我国渐渐具备独立完整的工业体系。对于农业建设方面，我们应当不分零星或成批，都要做到随地供应，各地的小型钢铁厂特别要满足农业水利建设和农具等的钢铁需要，形成工农大联盟，共同为社会主义建设的伟大目标，迈步前进。
    10、批判一切保守思想。我们要和一切困难作斗争，做事要和群众商量。革命的成功，完全是靠群众的智慧和力量，我们要拿出革命的干劲，不怕一切困难，批判一切右倾和保守思想。这是两条道路的斗争，我们坚决走社会主义的道路，服从党的领导，做到全心全意为人民服务，这样才能保证任务的完成。
    一九五八年是我国社会主义经济建设第二个五年计划的第一年，我们热烈地响应党和政府的号召，保证我国钢铁工业的生产和建设，超额完成任务。在武汉地区，保证要把武钢的一号高炉在今年年底投入生产。我们充满信心，在十五年内，我国的钢铁生产量，一定能够在保证质量的条件下，超过英国。
    最后祝大会成功。
