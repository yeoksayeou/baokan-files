Stripped of the "Neutral" Guise
By Our Staff Commentator
    Just as the divisionist activities instigated by imperialism were running rampant in the Central Sumatra region of Indonesia, and the rebel elements entrenched there issued an "ultimatum" to the Indonesian government, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles brazenly stepped forward and made a blatant intervention in Indonesia's internal affairs. At a press conference on the 11th, he said that the United States hoped to see an Indonesian government that was "constitutional" and "capable of reflecting the true desires of the Indonesian people," and also directly attacked President Sukarno's proposed "guided democracy." The next day, Washington diplomats openly clamored that the United States had adopted a "tough policy" toward Indonesia. From then on, the United States shed the guise of "neutrality" that it had been feigning in the Indonesian people's struggle to liberate West Irian. Why did the United States choose this moment to "speak out"? Obviously, this was to openly support the rebel elements in Indonesia, incite and encourage them to oppose the Indonesian government more frantically, in order to realize the U.S.'s long-planned scheme to subvert the Indonesian government.
    Because the Indonesian government led by President Sukarno has insisted on implementing a peaceful and independent policy, the United States has always harbored resentment towards this government and has tried every possible means to overthrow it. Countless facts have proven this over the years. Last year, a member of the Indonesian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Subcommittee revealed that Dulles had attempted to put a party that would implement policies in line with the Western line in charge of the Indonesian government, and had attacked the Sukarno plan in a letter. This time, Dulles, seeing that the rebellion in Central Sumatra had begun, thought the time was ripe, and became so carried away that he openly came out to discredit the Indonesian government.
    However, Dulles' intervention is futile. The peaceful and independent policy pursued by the Indonesian government is in line with the interests of the entire Indonesian nation, so it has won the support of the Indonesian people. In recent months, under the leadership of President Sukarno, the Indonesian government and people have launched a struggle to recover West Irian, get rid of colonial economic control, and safeguard national sovereignty and independence. In this just struggle, the patriotic forces throughout Indonesia have become more closely united. Therefore, when a handful of rebel elements openly threatened the government to undermine this struggle, they were resolutely opposed by the people of the whole country and fell into complete isolation. The delegations from various parts of Sumatra to Jakarta, demanding that the government take resolute measures against the rebels, are the most powerful proof.
    Dulles' misfortune lies in the fact that he has once again underestimated the strength of the Indonesian people. His crude intervention in Indonesia's internal affairs not only failed to boost the morale of the rebels, as he had imagined, but instead educated the Indonesian people, arousing a higher degree of vigilance and further clarifying the U.S.'s policy towards Indonesia, immediately arousing great indignation among the Indonesian people. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio has already issued a stern warning against the U.S.'s rude behavior of interfering in internal affairs, and refuted Dulles' fallacies. At the same time, the Indonesian government has also begun to take resolute measures against the few rebel elements.
    The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Indonesian people. They express their great indignation at Dulles' rude behavior of interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and express their great concern about the current development of the Indonesian situation. At this moment, we are willing to repeat a passage from Premier Zhou Enlai's speech to the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress: "Imperialist conspiracies are endless, and the Indonesian people's struggle will be long-term and tortuous. However, we believe that as long as all the patriotic and democratic forces of Indonesia, as President Sukarno has repeatedly called for, unite and persevere in the cause of safeguarding national sovereignty and independence, the imperialist conspiracies are bound to fail, and the Indonesian people's struggle is bound to be victorious."

    剥下了“中立”的外衣
    本报评论员
    正当帝国主义所策动的分裂活动在印度尼西亚中苏门答腊地区猖狂起来，盘踞在那里的叛乱分子向印度尼西亚政府发出了“最后通牒”的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯竟明目张胆地出面，对印度尼西亚的内政进行了露骨的干涉。他在11日记者招待会上说，美国希望看到印度尼西亚有一个“合乎宪法的”、“能够反映印度尼西亚人民的真正愿望的政府”，并且还直接攻击了苏加诺总统提出的“有指导的民主”。第二天，华盛顿外交人士更公然叫喊，美国已经对印度尼西亚采取了“强硬政策”。从此，剥下了美国在印度尼西亚人民为解放西伊里安的斗争中，伪装“中立”的外衣。美国为什么选择这个时机“讲话”呢？显然的，这是公开给印度尼西亚的叛乱分子撑腰，煽动和鼓励他们更猖狂地反对印度尼西亚政府，以便于实现美国蓄谋已久的颠覆印度尼西亚政府的计划。
    由于苏加诺总统所领导的印度尼西亚政府坚持执行了和平独立的政策，因此美国始终对这个政府怀恨在心，并且千方百计地企图把它推翻。几年以来，已经有无数事实证明了这一点。去年，据印度尼西亚国会外交小组委员会的一位委员揭露，杜勒斯曾企图以执行符合西方路线的政策的政党来执掌印度尼西亚的政权，并在一封信中攻击过苏加诺方案。这一次，不过是杜勒斯看到中苏门答腊的叛乱已起，认为时机已到，竟至得意忘形，公然出来诋毁印度尼西亚政府。
    但是，杜勒斯的干涉是徒劳的。印度尼西亚政府所执行的和平独立政策是符合印度尼西亚全民族利益的，所以它得到了印度尼西亚人民的拥护和支持。近几个月来，在苏加诺总统的领导下，印度尼西亚政府和人民展开了收复西伊里安、摆脱殖民主义经济控制、维护国家主权和独立的斗争。在这一正义的斗争中，印度尼西亚全国的爱国力量更加紧密地团结起来了。因此，当一小撮叛乱分子公然对政府进行威胁来破坏这一斗争的时候，就遭到全国人民的坚决反对，而陷入完全孤立的地位。苏门答腊各地的代表团到雅加达，要求政府对叛乱分子采取坚决的措施，就是最有力的说明。
    杜勒斯倒霉的地方就在于他又一次低估了印度尼西亚人民的力量。他粗暴地干涉印度尼西亚内政的行动，不但没有能像他所设想的那样，助长叛乱分子的声势，反而教育了印度尼西亚人民引起更高度的警惕，进一步认清了美国对印度尼西亚的政策，立刻激起了印度尼西亚人民的极大愤慨。印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约已经对美国干涉内政的粗暴行为，提出了严正的警告，并且驳斥了杜勒斯的谬论。同时，印度尼西亚政府对于少数叛乱分子，也开始采取了坚决的措施。
    中国人民是全力支持印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争的。对于杜勒斯干涉印度尼西亚内政的粗暴行为，表示十分的愤慨，对于目前印度尼西亚局势的发展，表示十分的关切。在这个时候，我们愿意重复一次周恩来总理在向我国人民代表大会第五次会议的讲话中所说的一段话：“帝国主义的阴谋是层出不穷的，印度尼西亚人民的斗争将是长期的和曲折的。但是，我们相信，只要印度尼西亚的一切爱国民主力量，像苏加诺总统一再号召的那样，在维护国家主权和独立的事业中团结一致，坚持斗争，帝国主义的阴谋是一定要失败的，印度尼西亚人民的斗争是一定要胜利的。”
