I completely agree with and support the various reports presented at the conference, and I am determined to strive for the tasks put forward by Vice Premiers Li and Bo for 1958. Now, I will introduce some preliminary opinions on the construction policy of the food industry for your correction.

The products and industries currently under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food Industry include raw salt and its by-products, sugar, edible vegetable oil, cigarettes, canned food, dairy products, egg products, alcohol and various alcoholic beverages, soap, glycerin, aromatics, etc. In addition, monosodium glutamate, starch, maltose, soy sauce, etc. are also planned to be managed separately. The so-called supervision or management sometimes refers to arranging its annual production plan; sometimes, in addition to arranging its annual production plan, certain plans are made for its long-term development plan; sometimes it refers to providing certain guidance on its production technology. Some of the above-mentioned products are also managed by non-industrial departments in some places, and they have also done a lot of work.

During the First Five-Year Plan, food industrial production saw considerable growth.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the food industry had a significant growth. Dairy products grew the fastest, increasing thirteen-fold; canned food, egg products, alcohol, and fruit wines and other alcoholic beverages increased two to three times; sugar increased nearly one-fold; raw salt and cigarettes increased by half; and edible vegetable oil increased by about 19 percent. In 1957, the total output value of these products was more than 7 billion yuan, which is equivalent to about one-fifth of the total output value of local industry. During the First Five-Year Plan, the basic construction investment of the food industry was about 700 million yuan, which is one of the factors that promoted the growth of the food industry, but the main reason for the relatively large growth of the food industry was the exploitation of the potential of existing enterprises and the potential of handicrafts. During the First Five-Year Plan, the production of the food industry basically met the needs of the people, accumulated hundreds of billions of yuan in construction funds for the country, and also exchanged a large amount of foreign exchange. The above shows that our work has been successful. The reason for these achievements is due to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the efforts of the broad masses of workers and staff; at the same time, agriculture has supported the production of the food industry in terms of raw materials. We express our gratitude for the support of agriculture.

Judging from the formulation and implementation of the 1957 production plan, overcoming conservative thinking and establishing promotional thinking are important factors for a great leap forward in the food industry.

However, our work is not perfect, and there are still many problems. Judging from the formulation and implementation of the 1957 production plan, it shows that our conservative thinking is not small. For example, the planned salt production was 7 million tons, but the actual output reached 8.26 million tons, exceeding the plan by 18 percent; the planned cigarette production was 4.03 million cases, but the actual output was 4.32 million cases, exceeding the plan by 7 percent; the planned alcohol production was 53,000 tons, but the actual output was 61,000 tons, exceeding the plan by 15 percent; the planned beer production was 32,000 tons, but the actual output was 53,000 tons, exceeding the plan by 60 percent. Although the overproduction of some products has a certain relationship with objective conditions, for example, raw salt production is inseparable from the climate. In 1956, the climate was not good, and only 4.94 million tons were produced. The difference in output between good and bad years is very large. However, no matter how much objective conditions affect production, they cannot play a decisive role in production. The decisive factor lies in people's efforts, and whether our thinking is to promote the development of production with a spirit of promotion, or to hinder it. In order to illustrate this problem, let us take the work of increasing oil production as an example. In 1955, the country was very enthusiastic about increasing oil production, and various places were promoting it, so the production increased by 130,000 tons; in 1956, some regions were not very enthusiastic about promotion, and the increase decreased to 80,000 tons; in 1957, more regions were not very enthusiastic about promotion, and the increase was only 50,000 tons; if this continues, there is a danger of being pushed back. In January this year, we jointly held a national oil production conference with the Food Industry Union. At the meeting, Director Jia of the Fourth Office of the State Council personally guided us in promotion. According to Director Jia's instructions, we first clarified and implemented the idea of promotion, then exchanged experiences, and studied increasing production. Finally, the meeting proposed a promotional task of increasing oil production by 180,000 tons, which greatly exceeded our original target of increasing production by 100,000 tons. This shows that our thinking is far behind the masses. However, we are determined to overcome conservative thinking and establish promotional thinking; if we solve this problem, we will have the confidence to keep up with the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, with the great leap forward in agricultural production, local industries will also experience a great leap forward. At present, many provinces have proposed that the output value of local industries should catch up with and exceed the output value of agriculture in five years. Local industry catching up with and exceeding the output value of agriculture is a great promotional call. The food industry is basically a local industry and also an important component of local industry. Wherever there are agricultural raw materials for food processing, there is a food industry. Therefore, in order to ensure the realization of the call for local industry to catch up with and exceed agriculture, food industry workers must work hard and promote the great development of the food industry with a leaping posture. From the current situation, the food industry foundation in many provinces is very poor. To have a great leap forward, it must be multiplied several times. It cannot be said that there are no difficulties and hardships in advancing in a relatively poor foundation, but it is precisely this arduous task that is our great and glorious task.

The layout of the food industry will undergo fundamental changes. Enterprises will not be more concentrated in cities, but will be more distributed in raw material producing areas and rural areas.

How can the food industry leap forward? This is a difficult problem facing us. If this problem is not solved, the desire for a leap forward will become a pipe dream. During the First Five-Year Plan, we once had the idea and practice of focusing on large factories in the construction of the food industry, while neglecting the establishment of small factories, handicraft workshops, and the development of processing industries in agricultural cooperatives. As a result, not only did the business not develop quickly, but it also added many new contradictions. For example, in 1956, we had to stop the expansion project of the Zhengzhou Oil Factory; otherwise, the contradiction of raw material supply would become more tense and acute. Although these experiences and lessons have paid some price and spent some money on starting and stopping projects, they have educated us deeply and benefited us a lot. Now that we have accumulated certain experience, we can more consciously and correctly solve the problem of how to leap forward, and no longer repeat the past idea and practice of focusing on large factories.

Where is the way out? According to our recent study of the various instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and based on the spirit of these instructions, we have reviewed and summarized the experience of the First Five-Year Plan, and we have reached the following conclusion: The policy of combining large, medium, and small factories proposed by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is the only correct policy; to implement this policy in the food industry, it must be a combination of large, medium, and small factories, with medium and small factories as the main focus, establishing more small factories, and developing the food processing sideline production of agricultural cooperatives. According to this policy, the layout of the food industry will also undergo fundamental changes in the future. Food industry enterprises will not be more concentrated in cities, but will be more distributed in rural areas in raw material producing areas, and distributed in agricultural cooperatives. The above policy mainly emphasizes medium and small factories, but it does not go to the other extreme and deny the necessity of building large factories. It is also necessary to build several slightly larger factories in the food industry under certain conditions and requirements. For example, slightly larger sugar factories should be built in areas where sugar materials are relatively concentrated; for comprehensive utilization of resources, it is also necessary to build several slightly larger cottonseed oil factories, because cottonseed hulls can extract furfural, and furfural is one of the raw materials for plastics and nylon, and the demand for exports is also very large. Furthermore, the scale of canned food factories and fruit wine factories for export should not be too small.

The food industry has many industries, and each industry has its own characteristics and foundation. Therefore, when implementing the above policy, each industry should have some different practices, and there should be no uniformity. The following will explain the practices of several industries.

"Collect more oil, collect less materials," develop the oil processing sideline production of agricultural cooperatives, and combine oil materials, feed, and fertilizer to promote the increase in oil material production.

First, the planning of the oil industry. For the development of the oil industry, we are considering changing the past practice of concentrating too much oil material processing, and adopting the method of establishing more small factories and developing the oil processing sideline production of agricultural cooperatives; the state can "collect more oil and collect less materials," so that oil materials, feed, and fertilizer can be combined to promote the increase in oil material production by agricultural cooperatives. During the Second Five-Year Plan, we plan to develop a large number of small oil presses with a daily output of about 200 kilograms of oil, and actively improve existing soil presses to reduce labor intensity and increase oil yield. For some large cities with relatively concentrated oil pressing equipment, some equipment will continue to be transferred to raw material producing areas to facilitate the combination of "three materials." On the other hand, in order to comprehensively utilize cottonseed raw materials, several slightly larger cottonseed oil factories are also planned as needed. The above-mentioned small oil pressing equipment is newly trial-produced, and its advantages are: small, weighing only 140 kilograms; simple structure and easy maintenance; the production technology is not complicated, and agricultural cooperative members can master the operation by learning for only one day; the power only needs three to five horsepower; the oil yield is higher than general soil presses; the investment is not much, about 1,000 yuan.

Salt production is planned as a whole according to sales areas; the sugar industry is combined according to the size of the producing areas.

Secondly, the planning of the salt industry. Raw salt is not suitable for long-distance transportation, and the production layout should be planned as a whole according to sales areas; not only should there be a considerable number of large salt farms to supply export salt and industrial salt (alkali and fertilizer), but also some medium and small salt farms should be planned to supply edible salt, which is conducive to the development of salt production and also conducive to the development of the local economy. The construction of medium and small salt farms can be done by the state, agricultural cooperatives, or a combination of the two, depending on the specific conditions of each place. This can also open up a way for some coastal agricultural cooperatives with low incomes to increase production and income.

Again, the planning of the sugar industry. We are considering that in order to accelerate the development of sugar and save state investment, in addition to planning some large and medium factories, we advocate establishing as many small semi-mechanized and semi-manual sugarcane sugar factories and manual beet sugar factories as possible. These small factories produce dozens to two or three hundred tons of sugar per year, and the investment is very small. Therefore, it can be jointly run by agricultural cooperatives and relevant departments, or it can be run by agricultural cooperatives themselves. This is beneficial to both the state and the agricultural cooperatives; agricultural cooperatives can not only increase income, but also rationally and fully utilize the land. For example, some mountainous areas in the south can open a small sugarcane sugar factory as long as they plant a few hundred acres of sugarcane, and the north can use saline-alkali land to plant a few hundred or thousands of acres of beets to open a small beet sugar factory. The green tops, leaves, and waste filaments of beets can also be used as good feed, which is conducive to the mutual promotion and common development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry.

Combining mother factories and sub-factories to process fruits and rationally utilize mountain resources.

Fourth, the planning of fruit processing. During the Second Five-Year Plan, due to the rapid development of mountain production, a large amount of fruit resources need to be utilized and processed by the food industry. There are many ways to process, and various different products can be produced, such as dried fruits, dried fruits, fruit juice, jam, canned fruits, fruit wine, etc. Among them, a considerable part of fruit wine and canned fruits can strive to be exported in large quantities to earn foreign exchange. The quality specifications for export products are relatively strict. In order to ensure the quality requirements and timely process decentralized raw materials, the establishment of factories can adopt the method of combining large factories and small factories, that is, mother factories and sub-factories. Sub-factories (processing stations) can go deep into the mountains, take agricultural cooperatives as their base, and carry out preliminary processing, while mother factories produce high-end products. This combination of mother and sub-factories is very common in foreign countries and has already started in China, and we plan to further promote it in the future. In addition, the experience of Quyang County, Hebei Province, in simplifying and running small enterprises frugally is also worth advocating. There is a winery in this county. When they encounter difficulties with raw materials, they go to the raw material area to set up points, spent 80 yuan to set up a simple small factory, and accumulated more than 17,000 yuan in just four months. In this way, not only was the factory supported, but also the resources in the mountains were rationally utilized.

The above is just an explanation of the planning of several industries. We are conducting or are conducting similar planning for other industries, such as cigarettes, various alcoholic beverages, dairy products, egg products, the fragrance industry, starch, monosodium glutamate, etc. In order to gain experience in planning small enterprises, we recently helped Qinyuan County, a mountainous county in Shanxi Province, to make a plan for developing the food industry during the Second Five-Year Plan. Qinyuan County has rich agricultural and pastoral resources and mountain resources, but because the county lacks processing capacity, many raw materials are rotten or transferred out; fresh milk is only sold for five cents a catty, beets are directly used as feed, and most of the mountain fruits are rotten; while the sugar, wine, etc. consumed by the people of this county have to be transferred in from other places. After preliminary planning, Qinyuan County will build six small liquor factories, one alcohol factory, four dairy processing plants, twenty-two small beet sugar factories, and ten small oil factories during the Second Five-Year Plan. The construction funds mainly rely on cooperatives, and the state provides necessary support. In this way, five years later, Qinyuan County will not only have developed agriculture and animal husbandry, but also have established many industries accordingly, and the economic landscape will undergo tremendous changes.

Similar to Qinyuan County, not only does Shanxi have it, but other places also have it. If similar planning is carried out, it is not difficult to see that the numerous labor force in rural areas and the rich resources in mountainous areas can all be used to their full potential, and the land can also be used to its full advantage. In this way, the food industry can rely on the strength of all parties, especially the strength of counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives, without asking the state for more investment, and can promote the food industry to move forward in a leaping posture. In this way, we also have the confidence to raise the production level of 1962 to a new peak.

The preliminary planning opinions for several products in 1962 are as follows:

	Product			Output
				Achieved in 1957		1962 Level
	Edible Vegetable Oil	1.45 million tons		3.1 million tons
	Raw Salt			8.26 million tons		14 million tons
	Sugar			850,000 tons			3 million tons
	Alcoholic Beverages	730,000 tons			1.2 million tons

Comrades, China is a vast country with abundant resources and a large population. The climate is different in the east, west, south, and north, and there are even more diverse food resources. Therefore, the construction of factories should be based on local conditions, combining large, medium, and small sizes, with medium and small sizes as the main focus, to facilitate full employment. We are a socialist new country, and also an ancient country with extensive culture. The main food industries that have been passed down for thousands of years, such as sugar mills, oil mills, wineries, soy sauce mills, grinding mills, and flour mills, all have their unique engineering techniques. The state advocates that the five mills belong to the commune, and the agricultural cooperatives have now become advanced cooperatives, and their public accumulation funds have been allowed to increase; if each of the 800,000 communes across the country accumulates 10,000 yuan each year, a total of 8 billion yuan can be accumulated each year, which provides the communes with good conditions for running industries. At present, there is a power problem in running industries in rural areas. Since small charcoal and coal engines have been made, small food industries (including light industries) with machines first and then manual labor can be universally run. Furthermore, there is no need to open night shifts in rural industries, which eliminates the tension of working day and night in large industries. While starting work during the day and generating electricity at night, it will be seen that the sound of machines can be heard everywhere, and electric lights are lit in every household. Agriculture is an enterprise, and cities are also villages. Urban and rural economies are prosperous, and cultural technology is striving to be advanced. Various industries are blooming, creating a new industrialized model for the world. Only the Chinese Communist Party, with its great body and refined thinking, can make such magnificent and detailed plans and projects. We are willing to rely on the efforts of all food industry workers and comrades, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and we have the confidence to leap forward towards a great victory.

    大、中、小厂相结合　以中小厂为主
    促进食品工业大跃进
    食品工业部部长李烛尘的发言
    我完全同意和拥护大会上的各项报告，并决心为李、薄二位副总理所提出的一九五八年的任务而努力奋斗。现在，我介绍一下食品工业有关建设方针方面问题的一些初步意见，请各位代表指正。
    食品工业部现在主管的产品和行业计有原盐及其副产品、食糖、食用植物油、卷烟、罐头、乳制品、蛋制品、酒精及各种饮料酒、肥皂、甘油、芳香等。此外尚有味精、淀粉、饴糖、酱油等最近也拟分别加以管起来。所谓主管或管理，有些是指安排它的年度生产计划；有些除安排它的年度生产计划外还就它的长期发展计划作某些规划；有些是指对它的生产技术进行某些指导。上述产品中有一部分在地方还归非工业部门管理，他们也是作了许多工作的。
    第一个五年计划期间食品  工业生产有了相当大的增长。
    在第一个五年计划期间，食品工业有相当大的增长。最快的是乳制品，增长了十三倍；增长二倍到三倍的有罐头、蛋制品、酒精、果酒等饮料酒；增长将近一倍的有食糖；增长半倍的有原盐、卷烟；食用植物油增长了百分之十九左右。在一九五七年这些产品的总产值约七十亿元以上，等于全部地方工业总产值的五分之一左右。在第一个五年计划期间，食品工业的基本建设投资约为七亿元，这是促使食品工业增长的因素之一，但食品工业所以有较大的增长，主要还是发挥了原有企业的潜力和手工业的潜力。在第一个五年计划期间，食品工业的生产，基本上满足了人民的需要，并为国家积累了一百几十亿元的建设资金，还换取了大量的外汇。以上表明，我们的工作是有成绩的。所以获得这些成绩，是由于中央的正确领导和广大职工努力的结果；同时，还由于农业在原料方面支援了食品工业生产。我们对农业的支援表示感谢。
    从1957年的生产计划的制定和执行情况来看，克服保守思想，树立促进思想，是食品工业大跃进的重要因素。
    但是，我们的工作并不是十全十美的，毛病还是很多的。就一九五七年的生产计划的制定及其执行情况来看，说明我们的保守思想并不小。例如：盐的生产计划是七百万吨，实际达到八百二十六万吨，超过计划百分之十八；卷烟计划四百零三万箱，实际四百三十二万箱，超过计划百分之七；酒精计划五万三千吨，实际六万一千吨，超过计划百分之十五；啤酒计划三万二千吨，实际五万三千吨，超过计划百分之六十。虽然，有些产品的超产和客观条件有一定关系，例如原盐生产和气候分不开，一九五六年气候不好，只产了四百九十四万吨，丰、歉年之间产量相差的幅度是很大的。但是，无论客观条件对生产有多大影响，总不能是对生产起决定性作用；决定性的因素是在于人的努力，是在于我们的思想是以促进的精神去推动生产发展，还是去促退。为着说明这个问题，就以油脂增产工作为例，一九五五年全国油脂增产干劲很大，各地都在促进，就增产了十三万吨；一九五六年，有些地区促进劲头不大，增产数降到八万吨；一九五七年，促进劲头不大的地区更多，增产数只有五万吨；再发展下去，就有被促退的危险。今年一月，我们和食品工会联合召开全国油脂生产会议。会议上由国务院四办贾主任亲自指导我们促进。根据贾主任的指示，我们首先搞通和贯彻了促进思想，然后交流经验，研究增产；最后，会议提出了增产十八万吨油的促进任务，大大地超过了我们原提十万吨的增产指标。这就说明，我们的思想是大大地落后于群众。但是，我们有决心克服保守思想，树立促进思想；解决了这个问题，我们就有信心跟上农业生产大跃进的新形势。
    第二个五年计划，随着农业生产的大跃进，地方工业也将出现大的跃进；目前已经有不少的省提出，五年后地方工业的产值要赶上和超过农业的产值。地方工业赶上和超过农业的产值，这是一个伟大的促进号召。食品工业基本上是地方工业，也是地方工业重要的组成部分之一，哪里有供食用的农业原料加工，哪里就有食品工业。因此，为保证地方工业赶上和超过农业这一号召的实现，食品工业职工就要紧张的努力，以跃进的姿态来促进食品工业的大发展。从目前情况看来，有不少省的食品工业基础是很差的，要来一个大跃进，就必须翻上几翻。在基础比较差的情况下前进，不能说没有艰难和困苦，但，正是这个艰巨的任务，也就是我们的伟大而光荣的任务。
    食品工业的布局，将出现根本性的改变，企业不是更多地集中在城市，而是更多地分布在原料产区和农村。
    食品工业如何跃进？这是摆在我们面前的难题，不解决这个难题，跃进的愿望就会变成空想。在第一个五年计划期间，我们对食品工业的建设，曾经一度产生过偏重于搞大厂的想法和做法，而忽视了办小厂，办手工业工场，也忽视了发展农业合作社的加工事业。结果不但事业发展不快，反而增加了不少新的矛盾。例如，一九五六年我们不得不停止了郑州油厂的扩建工程，不如此，原料供应的矛盾就会更加趋向紧张尖锐。这些经验教训，虽然付出了某些代价，花了一些上马下马的费用，但对我们教育很深，受益不少。现在当我们积累了一定的经验之后，就可以比较自觉而正确地解决如何跃进的难题，不再重复过去偏重于搞大厂的想法和做法。
    出路何在呢？根据最近我们对于中共中央历次指示的学习和研究，并以这些指示精神，检查和总结了第一个五年计划的经验之后，我们得出如下的结论：中共八大所提出的大、中、小相结合的方针，是唯一正确的方针；食品工业贯彻这个方针，就必须是大、中、小相结合，以中、小为主，多办小厂，并发展农业合作社的食品加工副业生产。根据这个方针，今后食品工业的布局也将出现根本性的改变，食品工业的企业，不是更多地集中在城市，而是更多地分布在原料产区的农村，分布在农业合作社。上述方针，主要是强调了中、小厂，但并不是走到另一极端，否定建大厂的必要。食品工业在一定的条件和要求之下，建立若干规模稍大一点的工厂也是必要的。比方，糖料比较集中的地方，应当建立规模稍大的糖厂；又如，为了综合利用资源，建立若干个规模稍大的棉子油厂也是必要的，因棉子壳可以提取糠醛，糠醛是塑料和尼龙的原料之一，出口方面的需要量也很大。再如，供出口用的罐头厂和果酒厂的规模也不宜过小。
    食品工业所属行业很多，各个行业有其不同的特点和基础。因此，贯彻上述方针时，各行业应有某些不同的做法，绝不能强求一致。以下就几个行业的做法来加以说明。
    “多收油，少收料”，发展农业合作社的油脂加工副业生产，使油料、饲料、肥料三者结合，以促进油料的增产。
    首先，油脂工业的规划。对于油脂工业的发展，我们考虑改变过去某些油料加工过于集中的做法，而采用多办小厂，并且发展农业合作社的油脂加工副业生产；国家可以“多收油，少收料”，这样就可以使油料、饲料、肥料三者结合，以促进农业合作社增产油料。第二个五年，我们规划大量发展日产约二百公斤油的小型榨油机，并积极改良现有土榨，以减轻劳动强度，提高出油率；对于某些榨油设备比较集中的大城市，则继续调出部分设备到原料产地，以利于“三料”的结合。另一方面，为了综合利用棉子原料，也根据需要，规划若干规模稍大的棉子油厂。上述小型榨油设备是最近试制的，它的优点是：小，重量只有一百四十公斤；结构简单，检修便利；生产技术不复杂，农业社员只要学习一天就能掌握操作；动力只要三、五匹马力；出油率比一般土榨高；投资不多，约一千元左右。
    盐业生产按销区统筹规划；制糖工业按产地大小结合。
    其次，制盐工业的规划。原盐不宜于长途运输，生产布局应按销区统筹规划；不但要有相当数量的大型盐场供应出口盐和工业用盐（碱和化肥），同时也应规划一些中、小型盐场供应食用盐，这样既有利于发展盐业生产，也有利于发展地方经济。建设中、小型盐场，根据各地具体情况，可以由国家办，也可以由农业社办，或是二者合办；这样还可为沿海某些收入不高的农业合作社，打开一条增加生产，增加收入的途径。
    再次，制糖工业的规划。我们考虑为了加快糖的发展和节省国家投资，除计划安排一些大、中厂之外，提倡尽量多办小型的半机械半手工操作的甘蔗糖厂，和手工操作的甜菜糖厂。这些小厂，年产糖几十吨到二、三百吨，投资很小；因此，可以由农业合作社同有关部门合办，也可以由农业合作社自办。这样做，对国家对农业合作社都是有利的；农业社不但可以增加收入，而且还可以合理充分地利用土地。如南方某些山区，只要种上几百亩甘蔗就可开办一个小甘蔗糖厂，北方可以利用盐碱地种上几百或千余亩甜菜，就可开办一个小甜菜糖厂，甜菜的青头、菜叶、废丝，还可以做为良好的饲料，有利于工农牧业相互促进，共同发展。
    母厂、子厂相结合，进行果类加工，合理利用山区资源。
    第四，果类加工的规划。第二个五年，由于山区生产发展很快，大量的果类资源需要食品工业利用加工，加工的办法很多，可以生产各种不同的产品，如果脯、果干、果汁、果酱、果类罐头、果酒等。其中，有相当一部分的果酒和果类罐头，可以争取大量出口，换取外汇。出口产品的质量规格要求是比较严的。为了既要保证质量的要求，又要及时处理分散的原料，建厂可以采取大厂和小厂，也就是母厂和子厂相结合的做法。子厂（加工站）可以深入山区，以农业社为据点，进行初步加工，母厂则生产高级产品。这种子母厂结合的做法，在国外很普遍，国内也已开始，今后准备进一步推广。此外，河北曲阳县因陋就简，勤俭办小企业的经验也很值得提倡。这个县有一个酒厂，他们遇到原料困难的时候，就进山到原料区设点，花了八十元，办了一个简易小厂，只四个月，就积累了一万七千多元。这样，不但养活了工厂，而且山区的资源也得到合理地利用。
    以上仅就若干行业的规划来加以说明，其他行业，如卷烟、各种饮料酒、乳制品、蛋制品、芳香工业、淀粉、味精……等，我们都进行或正在进行类似的规划。为着规划小型企业方面取得经验，最近我们帮助山西省一个山区县——沁源县，作第二个五年发展食品工业的规划。沁源县有着丰富的农牧业资源和山区资源，但由于该县缺乏加工能力，许多原料都烂掉或外调了；鲜奶只卖五分钱一斤，甜菜直接做饲料，山果大部分烂掉了；而这个县人民吃的糖、酒等，反而要从外地调入。经过初步规划，沁源县在第二个五年计划期内，将兴建六个小型白酒厂，一个酒精厂，四个乳品加工厂，二十二个小型甜菜糖厂，十个小油厂。建设资金主要依靠合作社，国家给予必要的扶持。这样，五年后的沁源县，不但将有发达的农牧业，而且还相应地建立了许多工业，经济面貌将要引起巨大的变化。
    类似沁源县，不但山西有，其他地方也有。假如都进行类似的规划，那么就不难看出，农村中众多的劳动力和山区丰富的资源，都可以做到人尽其才，物尽其用，土地也可做到地尽其利。这样做，食品工业就能依靠各方面的力量，特别是县、乡力量和农业社的力量，不向国家多要投资，而可以促进食品工业以跃进的姿态向前发展。这样做，我们也就有了信心把一九六二年的生产水平提到新的高峰。
    一九六二年，若干产品的初步规划意见如下：
    产    品    产    量
                一九五七年达到      一九六二年水平
    食用植物油　一百四十五万吨    　三百一十万吨
    原盐　      八百二十六万吨　    一千四百万吨
    食糖      　八十五万吨        　三百万吨
    饮料酒    　七十三万吨　        一百二十万吨
    同志们：中国是一个地大物博人多的国家，东西南北气候不同，食品资源更是多种多样，所以建设工厂即应采取因地制宜，本大中小相结合，而以中小为主的方针，便利全民就业。我们是社会主义的新国家，同时又是广有文化的古国。数千年相传下来的主要食品工业，如糖坊、油坊、酒坊、酱坊、碾坊、粉坊等，均有它的独特工程工艺。国家既主张五坊归社，眼前农业合作社又均成为高级社，其公积金已允许提高；如全国八十万个社每社每年积累一万元，每年总共可积累八十亿元，这更为社准备了办工业的好条件。现今农村办工业存在一个动力问题，自小型木炭、煤炭发动机作出后，就可以普遍办先机后手的食品小工业（包括轻工业在内）。又乡村办工业不必开夜班，免除大工业的日夜作工的紧张情况。而日间开工，夜间发电，行见处处闻机声，家家点电灯，农业即企业，城市亦乡村，城乡经济并繁荣，文化技术争先进，各工业百花齐放，为全世界创出一个工业化的新典型，这只有中国共产党体大思精，才能做出这样宏伟而细致的规划和工程。我们愿依靠全体食品工业职工同志们的努力，在中共中央、毛主席和国务院的领导下，有信心向伟大的胜利而跃进。
