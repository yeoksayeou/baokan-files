Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. Regularly using revolutionary traditions and the advanced deeds of outstanding model figures to educate the broad masses of cadres and people has become one of the important methods for the Party organizations in Hong'an County, a revolutionary old base area in Hubei Province, to carry out ideological and political work. At present, the county is carrying out a study of the advanced deeds of Xu Zhengxiu, an old lady and family member of a revolutionary martyr who persisted in the revolution for thirty years and loves labor and the collective, and Fang Heming, a Red Army veteran regimental commander who returned to his hometown after being demobilized. 100,000 cadres and masses are participating in the study.
Since last spring, Hong'an County has organized similar studies five times. Because these studies were based on the ideological conditions of the cadres and masses at the time and were closely integrated with production, they have been extremely effective. Many cadres took the initiative to examine their own thinking during the study, and some even wrote letters of determination. Now, the county is filled with a strong political atmosphere, and the broad masses of cadres and people are in high spirits, showing a revolutionary and vigorous scene everywhere.

These outstanding model figures who have been commended in Hong'an County have all emerged from various tasks and are familiar to everyone. In particular, the advanced deeds of Xu Dama and Fang Heming are almost household names. Whether cadres or the masses, they all take them as examples, and some even compare them to ideological "doctors" and keys to solving difficulties, constantly encouraging themselves to move forward. For example, the women in this county originally did not have the habit of going to the fields to produce. After studying the deeds of Xu Dama, who is over seventy years old and works selflessly, the attendance rate of women in many places has increased significantly. In some townships and communes, because this year's water conservancy tasks are heavy and most of the male labor force has gone to build water conservancy projects, the women have taken on the work of accumulating fertilizer, weeding, and cultivating winter crops. Some places even have women digging sod, burning weeds, and picking up rice stubble under the moonlight at night.

Party organizations at all levels in Hong'an County attach great importance to the outstanding model figures who have emerged in various tasks. In the current winter production, many model figures have been discovered and commended in various places. For example, the water conservancy task in the Er Cheng District this year is very heavy, and the technical force is insufficient. Jiang Jirong, the deputy head of Xinzhai Township, has become an expert in water conservancy through hard study, and has become a "five-capable" cadre in water conservancy: able to survey terrain and determine dam sites, able to calculate slope ratios, able to calculate earthwork and stonework, able to use leveling instruments, and able to guide construction on site. After his deeds were spread, the Er Cheng District Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately organized township and commune cadres to launch a upsurge in learning water conservancy technology, and the vast majority of the more than 190 township and commune cadres in the district became "five-capable" cadres. After studying the deeds of Dong Deyi, the director of the newly built agricultural cooperative in Gaoqiao District, who worked hard to run the cooperative, the original thirteen cooperative directors were tired of their work, but now they have all become full of enthusiasm and are working hard.

In Hong'an County, from the First Secretary of the County Party Committee to the secretaries of Party committees at all levels, they personally grasp ideological and political work. They often understand and analyze the ideological conditions of cadres and the masses, and carry out education on the ideological problems they discover. When cadres were sent down to lower levels in March and April last year, the Hong'an County Party Committee, based on the ideological conditions of the cadres at the time, organized everyone to study the advanced deeds of Nie Dunwen, Li Haiqing, and Wang Zuntang, cadres who actively requested to be sent down, worked hard and deeply, and mobilized the masses to change the backwardness of the local area, promoting the development of the work of sending cadres down to lower levels. Because of the importance attached to ideological and political work, a large number of outstanding model figures have been discovered and cultivated in various tasks. In the past year alone, the leading organs of this county have summarized and commended 200 advanced units with high yields and 100 outstanding model figures. There are even more advanced collectives and outstanding model figures summarized and commended below the county level.

At present, ideological and political work in Hong'an County has gradually become institutionalized. All forty-eight townships in the county have established night Party schools, and most agricultural cooperatives have established patriotism days or love-the-collective days, regularly conducting political and ideological education for cadres and the masses.

### 思想上的“医生”　解决困难的“钥匙”  红安十万人学习徐正修方和明

　　思想上的“医生”　解决困难的“钥匙”
    红安十万人学习徐正修方和明
    新华社武汉7日电　经常用革命传统和优秀模范人物的先进事迹教育广大干部和群众，已成为湖北省革命老根据地红安县党组织进行思想政治工作的重要方法之一。目前，这个县正在开展向坚持革命三十年、平时热爱劳动、热爱集体的革命烈士家属徐正修老大妈和解甲归田的红军老团长方和明先进事迹的学习。参加学习的干部和群众有十万人。
    去年春天以来，红安县曾先后五次组织了类似这样的学习。由于这些学习都根据当时干部和群众的思想状况，紧紧结合生产进行，因而收效极大。许多干部在学习中，主动地检查了自己的思想，有的还写了决心书。现在，全县政治空气浓厚，广大干部和群众情绪旺盛，到处是一片革命朝气蓬勃的气象。
    红安县这些被表扬的优秀模范人物，都是从各项工作中涌现出来的，为大家所熟悉，特别是徐大妈和方和明的先进事迹，几乎是家喻户晓，无论是干部或群众，都拿他们作榜样，甚至有些人把他们比喻为思想上的“医生”和解决困难的“钥匙”，不断地鼓舞自己前进。例如这个县的妇女原来大都没有下地生产的习惯，学习了七十多岁的徐大妈忘我劳动的事迹以后，许多地方的妇女出勤率显著提高。有些乡、社由于今年水利任务大，男劳动力大都修水利去了，妇女就担负起了积肥、除草和培育冬季作物的工作，甚至有些地方的妇女到了夜晚还在月光下挖草皮、烧杂草、拣谷蔸。
    红安县各级党组织十分重视各项工作中涌现出来的优秀模范人物。在目前的冬季生产中，各地就发现并表扬了不少模范人物。例如二程区今年水利任务很大，技术力量不足，新寨乡副乡长江继容由于苦钻技术，从外行变成了内行，成为水利方面的“五会”干部：会测量地形确定坝址，会计算坡比，会计算土方石方，会使用水平仪，会指导工地施工。他的事迹被传开以后，中共二程区委立即组织乡社干部掀起一个学习水利技术的热潮，全区一百九十多名乡社干部绝大部分成了“五会”干部。高桥区通过学习新建农业社主任董德义艰苦办社的事迹以后，原来十三个社主任工作疲沓，现在个个变得情绪饱满，干劲很大。
    在红安县，从中共县委第一书记到各级党委书记，都亲自抓思想政治工作。他们经常了解、分析干部和群众的思想状况，并针对发现的思想问题进行教育。去年3、4月间干部下放时，中共红安县委根据当时干部的思想状况，组织大家学习积极要求下放、在工作中艰苦深入、发动群众转变了当地落后面貌的干部聂敦文、黎海清和汪遵汤的先进事迹，推动干部下放工作的开展。由于重视思想政治工作，就在各项工作中发现和培养了大批优秀模范人物。仅去年一年，这个县的领导机关就总结和表扬了二百个丰产先进单位、一百个优秀模范人物。县以下总结和表扬的先进社和优秀模范人物就更多了。
    目前，红安县的思想政治工作已逐渐形成制度。全县四十八个乡，乡乡建立了夜党校，大部分农业社建立了爱国日或爱社日，经常对干部和群众进行政治思想教育工作。
