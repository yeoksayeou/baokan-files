    The socialist revolution in the economic, political, and ideological spheres has established a new relationship between people and regions in our country: a relationship of mutual love, mutual assistance, and friendly cooperation. When a region wants to transform low-lying areas on a large scale to store water and plant rice, it first organizes people to visit other places to learn about the relevant practices and experiences. When this region makes significant achievements, other regions organize many people to visit and learn from the experiences that have been developed through practice, while also pointing out the shortcomings and weaknesses, and introducing the good experiences of their own regions to the people here. With regard to the material and technical support needed for this region to develop production after the transformation of the low-lying areas, all regions automatically offer it during their visits. Such a relationship is a truly communist relationship. Such a noble relationship has never existed and could not exist in any period of history, because people and regions did not have a common, long-term goal of struggle at that time.

    Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, this brand-new relationship has been established very naturally. The establishment of this new relationship will give a more powerful impetus to the development of productive forces. Things that a region cannot do on its own can be done smoothly with the mutual assistance and cooperation of several regions. Fragmentary and incomplete experiences in individual regions will be developed into systematic and complete experiences through the common practice of several regions. Things that individual regions need to explore for many years can now be quickly understood by visiting neighboring regions, thereby avoiding many detours and setbacks. An advanced technology that used to take many years to promote on a large scale can now be universally promoted in a very short period. The superiority of the socialist system is clearest here.

    In the past, mutual visits between regions often had an accidental nature, which was far from enough. This mutual visit should be made a regular system. Some central departments and provinces, when holding special meetings to discuss work in a certain area, choose regions with greater achievements and more experience in this area as the meeting place, holding the meeting while visiting and learning on the spot, comparing the local experience with the specific conditions of their own regions, and determining the action plans and steps for their own regions. This method has been developed since winter and should be said to be a very good method.

    In the past, some places created very successful experiences in some areas, but they could not be quickly promoted and applied to a wide range; some regions made mistakes and took detours in some areas, while other regions made the same mistakes and took the same detours after a long time. This situation was quite common. One of the important reasons is that there was no organization of regular mutual visits and evaluations. The socialist system gives us the possibility of promoting successful experiences at the fastest speed and avoiding detours to the greatest extent, but we have not fully utilized the superiority of socialism to turn this possibility into reality. This situation will rapidly change with the widespread adoption of the method of visits and evaluations.

    地区之间的新关系
    林木
    经济上、政治上和思想上的社会主义革命，使我们国家在人与人、地区与地区之间建立了一种新的关系，就是互爱互助、友好合作的关系。一个地区要大规模改造洼地，蓄水种稻，事先就组织一些人到外地参观，学习有关这方面的做法与经验。这个地区做出了较大的成就，别的地区又组织许多人来这个地区参观，学习这里经过实践而向前发展了的经验，同时也指出这里的缺点和弱点，把自己地区一些好的经验介绍给这里的人们；对于这里在洼地改造以后为了发展生产所需要的物资和技术的支援，各地区在参观的时候都自动提供出来。这样的关系，是真正共产主义的关系。这样高尚的关系，历史上任何时期都不曾有过，也不可能有，因为那时候人与人、地区与地区没有共同的远大奋斗目标。
    现在，在共产党的领导下，这种崭新的关系很自然地建立起来了。这种新关系的建立，将使生产力的发展得到更为有力的推动。一个地区自己办不到的事，在若干个地区的互助和协作之下能够顺利办到。个别地区的零碎而不完整的经验，将经过若干地区的共同实践而发展成系统的完整的经验。个别地区需要摸索许多年才能弄清的事情，现在只要到友邻地区参观一下就能很快地弄清，从而避免许多弯路和挫折。从前需要经过好多年才能在大范围内推广的一项先进技术，现在在很短的期间就能普遍推广了。社会主义制度的优越性，在这里是最清楚不过的了。
    从前，各地区的互相参观时常带有偶然的性质，这是很不够的。应当使这种互相参观成为一种经常的制度。有一些中央部门和省份在召开专门会议讨论某方面工作的时候，就选择对这方面工作有较大成就和较多经验的地区作为开会地点，一面开会，一面实地参观学习，拿当地的经验同自己地区的具体情况互相印证，确定自己地区的行动计划和步骤，这办法在冬季以来得到了发展，这应当说是一条很好的办法。
    过去有一些地方在某些方面创造了很成功的经验，但不能很快地推广应用到广大范围；有一些地区在某些方面犯了错误，走了弯路，而另外一些地区过了很久以后也犯了同样的错误，走了同样的弯路，这种情形相当不少。其重要原因之一，就是没有组织经常的互相参观和评比。社会主义制度给了我们用最大速度推广成功经验和最大限度地避免弯路的可能，但我们还没有充分地利用社会主义的优越性来把这种可能统统变成现实。这种情形将随着参观评比办法的普遍采用而迅速改变。
