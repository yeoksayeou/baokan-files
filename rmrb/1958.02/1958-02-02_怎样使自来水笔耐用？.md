　　How to Make Fountain Pens Durable?

The lifespan of fountain pens of the same brand varies greatly depending on usage and maintenance.

Although there are many types of fountain pens (such as gold nib pens and iridium nib pens), their usage and maintenance methods are the same. Here are some methods for your reference.

　　I. Use correct hand posture when writing. Some people, in order to obtain particularly fine handwriting, often like to use the side or reverse side of the nib (the side with the trademark is the front side) to write. In fact, the processing of the reverse side of the nib is not as fine as the front side, and writing with the reverse side appears rough and lacks elasticity. Over time, it will also affect the normal elasticity of the front of the nib, causing problems such as unsmooth ink flow and inconsistent stroke thickness. As for writing with the side of the nib, because the slit does not directly touch the paper, it is difficult for the ink to flow smoothly. At the same time, relying solely on one half of the iridium tip to write, over time, will wear away one half of the iridium tip a lot, while the other half remains intact. This will lose coordination and make it impossible to continue using. The correct writing posture should be: place the front of the nib squarely on the paper, keeping the entire pen at an angle of 45-75 degrees to the plane of the paper.

　　II. Use even force. Applying too much force will cause the iridium tip of the nib to spread open, causing the paper to tear, or even break the iridium tip. Applying too little force will affect the ink flow.

　　III. Do not misuse ink. The composition and formula of different brands of ink vary, and if used interchangeably, chemical changes will occur, producing a sedimentation effect that damages the ink sac and obstructs the ink flow. It is best to always use the same ink. If you must switch to another ink, be sure to thoroughly clean out the original ink in the ink sac with clean water. The ink sac should always contain ink; do not wait until there is not a drop of ink left before refilling. If there is too little ink in the ink sac, there will be more air, which can easily cause excessive ink flow and leakage when writing. When refilling ink, do not allow the nib to touch the bottom of the bottle to avoid damaging the nib.

　　IV. Keep the nib and the pen section (the part that holds the nib) clean and dry. Wipe the nib clean after refilling ink, and often wash the ink sac with water to prevent the pen feed slits from becoming clogged, which can cause leakage.

　　V. Do not play with the pen clip unnecessarily. The fatigue limit of the pen clip is generally around 10,000 times (i.e., from when it is clipped to the pocket to when it is taken out of the pocket counts as one time). Playing with it casually will inevitably shorten the lifespan of the pen clip.

　　VI. After using a fountain pen, immediately put on the cap and clip it to your pocket. Not capping the pen after use or placing it flat on the table will cause the ink to leak into the cap, and it is also easy for the nib to dry out and stop writing.

　　怎样使自来水笔耐用？
　　方孜行
    同一牌号的自来水笔，由于使用方法和保养情况不同，自来水笔使用年限的长和短就大有差别。
    自来水笔的种类虽多（如金笔、铱金笔等），但是它的使用和保养方法相同。这里介绍一些方法，供大家参考。
    一、写字时手势要正确。有的人为了求得特细的笔迹，往往爱用笔尖的侧面或反面（有商标的一面是正面）写字。其实，笔尖反面的加工不如正面细致，用反面写字便显得毛糙、缺乏弹力。时间久了，还会影响笔尖正面的正常弹力，造成出水不畅、笔道粗细不一等弊病。至于用笔尖的侧面写字，因为缝道没有直接接触纸面，很难流利地下水。同时，单靠笔尖铱头的一爿写字，久而久之，便会将铱头的一爿磨掉很多，而另一爿却依然完整，这就会失去协调作用，无法继续使用。正确的写字手势应该是：将笔尖的正面端正地放到纸上，使整支笔和纸的平面保持在45—75度之间。
    二、用力要匀称。用力重了会使笔尖的铱头叉开，造成拉纸，甚至使铱头一下揿断。用力轻了，会影响出水。
    三、不乱用墨水。不同牌号的墨水的成分和配方互有差异，如果穿插使用，会引起化学变化，产生沉淀作用，伤害皮胆、阻碍笔道。最好经常使用一种墨水，如必须换用另一种墨水时，也要将皮胆内原有的墨水用清水彻底打尽。皮胆内要经常保有墨水，不要到一滴水都没有了再吸水。皮胆内水少了，空气就多起来，写字时容易发生出水太涌和漏水现象。吸墨水时切勿将笔尖接触瓶底，以免损坏笔尖。
    四、使笔尖和笔项（装笔尖部分）经常保持清洁和干燥。吸完墨水要擦干净，还应常常用水洗打皮胆，以免塞住笔舌缝道而引起漏水。
    五、无故不玩弄笔夹。笔夹的疲劳度一般在一万次左右（即自挂到口袋上到从口袋上取下来算一次）。随手玩弄，势必会缩短笔夹的使用期限。
    六、自来水笔用过以后，应即套上笔套，插在口袋上。用笔后不套笔套或平放在桌上，会使墨水漏进笔套里面，也容易发生笔尖干结不下水现象。
