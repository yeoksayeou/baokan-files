The People's Daily Column:

I fully agree with the various reports of the conference. Now I would like to briefly report to the conference on the situation of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province.

The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, like all other parts of the country, after achieving victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front, continued to achieve victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in the struggle of the whole people's rectification, the counterattack against the bourgeois rightists, and the crackdown on rural landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are full of confidence, working hard, riding the waves, and striving for the top, fighting bravely to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Everyone Learns from Da Yu, Everyone Acts as the Foolish Old Man
Planned Targets Repeatedly Surpassed

The role of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people under the new socialist relations of production is truly great and incalculable. Under the enthusiastic labor enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, the production plan of the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee and the People's Committee has repeatedly surpassed various indicators. For example, the autonomous prefecture originally planned to increase the total grain output by 5.78 percent this year compared to last year, increasing production by more than 70.6 million catties. After repeated revisions, it was set to increase production by more than 227 million catties. However, at the party congresses of various counties, a goal was put forward to increase the total grain output to 1,776.6 million catties this year, increasing production by more than 640 million catties, an increase of 56.4 percent compared to last year. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, the prefecture increased the irrigated area. The original plan was 270,000 mu, which was later increased to more than 400,000 mu, and now it has been increased by the masses to more than 610,000 mu, an increase of nearly double. The number of water conservancy projects increased from the original plan of more than 5,500 to more than 58,700, and now the actual number of projects under construction has reached 65,000. The number of labor days increased from 4.58 million to 8.43 million, and then to 9.24 million. Now, nearly 250,000 farmers are actually building water conservancy projects every day, accounting for 35.7 percent of the rural labor force in the prefecture. The concerns of fearing difficulties and risks, such as "no land to repair," "no money to repair," "large projects cannot be repaired," "no technology to repair," and "the eye of heaven cannot be repaired," have all been broken. Now it is "to change the river to flow backward," "to let the water hang over the cliffs," "to irrigate the north fields with the water of the south mountain," and "to fill the eye of heaven and fertilize the Leigong fields." "Everyone learns from Da Yu, everyone acts as the Foolish Old Man." Indigenous designs, indigenous methods, indigenous tools, and indigenous technologies are all put into use. The overwhelming enthusiasm of the peasants is truly "invincible and unconquerable." They say, "People should be organized into cooperatives, trees should be organized into cooperatives, and fish should be organized into cooperatives." Therefore, not only in water conservancy, but also in all aspects of production such as fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, fish farming, and animal husbandry, they are full of energy.

The Poor Face of the Mountainous Area Has Changed Greatly
From Insufficient Grain to Surplus Grain

The vast majority of ethnic minorities in Hunan Province live in mountainous areas. Developing mountainous areas and developing mountainous production is the most important task of ethnic minority people in socialist construction. After the Party Central Committee put forward the call for cadres to go to the countryside and mountains and develop mountainous production, it further encouraged the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups to build mountainous areas. The natural resources of mountainous areas are extremely rich, but due to the long-term cruel oppression, exploitation, and plunder under the reactionary rule in the past, natural resources have not been developed, and production has not only failed to develop but has also been severely damaged, resulting in extreme poverty for the people. Some people cannot see this historical fact. When they talk about mountainous areas, they think that the people there are poor and the land is poor, and there is no future for construction. This is completely wrong. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the wisdom of the people of all ethnic groups has been brought into play, and they have used their diligent hands to change the poor face of the mountainous areas left over from the old society. Before liberation, the autonomous prefecture only produced 700 to 800 million catties of grain each year, and some rations had to be transported from other places every year. Last year, grain production reached 1,135 million catties, from insufficient to surplus. In addition to self-sufficiency, 70 to 80 million catties can be exported throughout the year. For example, after Guzhang County realized agricultural cooperation, all aspects of production have developed significantly. Last year, the total output value of agricultural and sideline production in the county increased by nearly 100 percent compared to 1952, including a 43.8 percent increase in grain, an 87 percent increase in tea, a 57 percent increase in the number of live pigs, and a 5.29-fold increase in tea oil. The income of farmers throughout the county increased by about 60 percent compared to 1952. 53.3 percent of the agricultural cooperatives have caught up with or exceeded the production level and living standards of the local well-to-do middle peasants. "The Xiangxi Mountain Area Has a Bright Future" and "The Xiangxi Mountain Area Has Great Potential" are the conclusions reached by the people of all ethnic groups from the facts.

Formulate a Comprehensive Plan for the Great Leap Forward in Production
Strive to Achieve a Yield of 800 Catties per Mu in Three to Five Years

In the upsurge of the great leap forward in production last winter and this spring, we conducted extensive investigations and studies on the construction and development of mountainous areas, and have made preliminary comprehensive plans. From this plan, we can already see the bright prospects for the construction of mountainous areas. The autonomous prefecture is a rich and beautiful mountainous area. The Wuling Mountains stretch from north to south, the climate is warm, the average annual temperature is around 17 degrees Celsius, the annual rainfall is 1,200 mm, the soil is fertile, the green grass is evergreen all year round, the streams, rivers, springs, and wells are densely distributed, and there are forests covering the sky everywhere. In this vast and sparsely populated mountainous area, each person can be allocated an average of more than 16 mu of cultivated land, soil, and barren mountains. We plan to turn all the cultivated land in the prefecture into paddy fields, and strive to reach or exceed the target of 800 catties of grain per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within three to five years. We are fully confident that this plan can be achieved. In addition to producing rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, corn, and other food crops, the prefecture also produces more than 360 kinds of local specialties and livestock products, and more than 100 kinds of medicinal materials. Among them are tung oil, tea oil, paint, wood, white wax, and giant salamanders, which are famous in domestic and foreign markets. While vigorously developing agricultural production, we will also comprehensively and vigorously develop economic forests, develop pig breeding, beekeeping, and the breeding of cattle and sheep. In terms of animal husbandry, in 1958, it is planned to raise 1.22 million live pigs, reaching more than three per household, an increase of 30 percent compared to last year; the number of cattle will be developed to more than 270,000, and the number of goats will be developed to more than 50,000.

Mountainous areas have always been blocked by transportation, and culture and technology are relatively backward. One-fifth of the working days are spent on transportation every year. Even so, some areas still have difficulty transporting timber, local specialties, and grain. Therefore, developing transportation in mountainous areas, breaking old farming habits, and promoting technological reforms are important issues for developing mountainous production. In the few years since liberation, we have made considerable achievements in this regard. Now, the mileage of highways open to traffic in the prefecture has doubled compared to 1952, and automobiles can be driven to all counties except two. In terms of farming techniques, after three years of trial planting and promotion, the old habit of not growing double-cropping rice in the autonomous prefecture was broken. Last year, more than 110,000 mu of double-cropping rice were planted, and this year it is planned to increase to more than 270,000 mu. More than 119,000 mu of early rice were planted in experimental Tian Shui fields. In the past, the masses were not accustomed to composting in pits. After the cadres personally went to the fields, took the lead in setting an example, and organized visits, the masses also began to compost in pits. The difficulties in building mountainous areas cannot stop the revolutionary forces of the people of all ethnic groups. We have the determination and confidence to overcome difficulties and build mountainous areas into happy paradises as soon as possible, vigorously develop mountainous production, and more forcefully support the socialist construction of the motherland.

Party Leadership, National Unity, Socialism is the Guarantee of a Happy Life for Ethnic Minorities

All construction achievements in ethnic minority areas have been achieved under the leadership of the great Communist Party, with the close unity and mutual assistance of the people of all ethnic groups, and on the basis of the great victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The people of ethnic minorities have deeply realized from their own personal experiences that Party leadership, national unity, and taking the socialist road are the guarantees for the people of ethnic minorities to move towards a happy life. Last summer, when the Party was carrying out the rectification movement, some rightists, under the guise of "caring" for ethnic minorities and wearing the cloak of ethnicity, incited ethnic division and encouraged ethnic minorities to leave the leadership of the Party and the socialist road among the people of ethnic minorities, especially among ethnic minority intellectuals. The rightists Pan Guangdan, Xiang Da, and the Tujia rightist Peng Bo used all kinds of conspiracies and tricks among the people of all ethnic groups in Xiangxi to incite ethnic division and undermine ethnic unity. However, in front of the awakened people of all ethnic groups, the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities of the rightists on ethnic issues, like their activities on other issues, were thoroughly defeated. Through this struggle against the rightists, the socialist consciousness of the ethnic minorities in our region has been further enhanced. The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture was officially established in October last year on the basis of the victory in the counterattack against the rightists. The close unity of all ethnic groups has been further strengthened and consolidated.

Carry out the Rectification and Socialist Education Movement
Thoroughly Criticize and Expose Local Nationalism

In this struggle of rectification and anti-rightist, it was indeed exposed that there are serious local nationalist ideas and emotions among some ethnic minority intellectuals and cadres. The rightists took advantage of these ideas and emotions to carry out conspiracy activities. On the issue of ethnic regional autonomy, they advocated "merging outward" or "going it alone"; they used the pretext of ethnicization of autonomous organs to exclude Han cadres and exclude the leadership of the Communist Party; they used the pretext of ethnic characteristics, stuck to old ways, refused to make progress, and even refused to take the socialist road. Local nationalists actually want to undermine national unity and hinder the progress of ethnic minorities. They are absolutely incompatible with socialism and communism. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose them, thoroughly expose and criticize them, and resolutely fight against these tendencies, so as to eliminate the ideological influence of local nationalism. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report on the rectification movement at the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "In all ethnic minority areas and among ethnic minority populations that have basically realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, socialist education should also be carried out, and anti-rightist struggles should be carried out appropriately." "In socialist education and anti-rightist struggles among ethnic minorities, in addition to the same content as in Han areas, emphasis should also be placed on opposing nationalist tendencies." This instruction is fully in line with the situation in our region. We have gradually launched the rectification movement and the socialist education movement, and are taking effective measures to make the rectification and socialist education movement deep and thorough.

Fellow representatives, we believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the close unity of all ethnic groups, concerted efforts, and hard work, we will definitely be able to build our motherland into a great modernized socialist power.

    湘西山区前途似锦
    石邦智代表报告湘西土家族、苗族自治州的情况
    我完全同意大会的各项报告。我现在向大会简要汇报一下湖南省湘西土家族、苗族自治州的情况。
    湘西土家族、苗族自治州和全国各地一样，在取得了经济战线上的社会主义革命的胜利后，又接着在全民整风、反击资产阶级右派和打击农村地主、富农、坏分子的斗争中，取得了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利。现在，全州各族人民正满怀信心，鼓起干劲，乘风破浪，力争上游，为争取实现今年农业生产大跃进而奋勇战斗。
    人人学大禹  个个做愚公  各项计划指标  一再被突破
    劳动人民在新的社会主义生产关系下的革命积极性的作用真是伟大的，不可估量的。自治州党委和人民委员会的生产计划，在各族人民积极高涨的劳动热情下，各项指标，一再被突破。比如自治州原来计划今年粮食总产量比去年增加百分之五点七八，增产七千零六十多万斤，一再修改，定为增产二亿二千七百多万斤；但是，在各县党代表大会上，却提出了今年粮食总产量达到十七亿七千六百多万斤，增产六亿四千多万斤的奋斗目标，比去年增产百分之五十六点四。为了保证粮食丰收，全州增加灌溉面积，原计划是二十七万亩，后增定为四十多万亩，现在被群众提增到六十一万多亩，增加近一倍。水利工程由原计划五千五百多处增到五万八千七百处，而现在实际动工的已达六万五千处了；劳动工日由四百五十八万个增到八百四十三万个，又提到九百二十四万个，而现在实际每天都有近二十五万农民在兴修水利，占全州农村劳动力的百分之三十五点七。过去那些“无地可修”，“无钱不能修”，“大工程不能修”，“无技术不能修”，“天眼孔不能修”等等畏难怕险的顾虑都被打破了，现在是“要改河水倒流”，“要水悬空过岩壁”，“要南山水灌北山田”，“要填死天眼孔，灌肥雷公田”。“人人学大禹，个个做愚公”，土设计，土办法，土工具，土技术，都要他起作用。农民排山倒海的劲头真是“无坚不摧，无攻不克”。他们说：“人要组织合作化，树也要组织合作化，鱼也要组织合作化”，因此，不仅是在水利方面，就是在积肥、造林、养鱼、畜牧等各个生产方面，也都浑身是劲。
    山区贫困面貌大有改变  从粮食不足到粮食有余
    湖南省的少数民族，绝大多数都居住在山区。开发山区、发展山区的生产，是少数民族人民在社会主义建设中的最主要的任务。在党中央提出了干部下乡上山和发展山区生产的号召后，更加鼓舞了广大各族人民建设山区的热情。山区的自然资源是极其丰富的，但是由于过去在反动统治长期残酷的压迫、剥削和掠夺下，自然资源没有得到开发，生产不但得不到发展反而遭到严重破坏，因而人民生活极端贫困。有的人看不到这个历史事实，他们一谈到山区，反认为那里人穷地穷，建设没有前途，这是完全错误的。解放以来，在党和政府的领导下，发挥各族人民的智慧，已经用勤劳的双手，改变了旧社会遗留下来的山区的贫困面貌。解放前，自治州每年只出产粮食七亿至八亿多万斤，年年都要从外地运进一些口粮。而去年生产粮食已达十一亿三千五百多万斤，由不足到有余，除自给外，全年还可输出七、八千万斤。比如，古丈县在实现农业合作化后，各项生产都有显著的发展。去年全县农副业生产总值比一九五二年增长了近一倍，其中粮食增加百分之四十三点八，茶叶增长百分之八十七，生猪头数增加了百分之五十七，茶油增加了五点二九倍。全县农民的收入比一九五二年增加了百分之六十左右，百分之五十三点三的农业社，已经赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平和生活水平。“湘西山区前途似锦”、“湘西山区大有搞头”，这是各族人民从事实中得到的结论。
    制定生产大跃进全面规划  争取三五年内亩产八百斤
    在去冬今春生产大跃进的高潮中，我们对建设和开发山区进行了广泛的调查研究，并已作出了初步的全面规划，从这个规划中，就已经可以初步看到建设山区的灿烂前景。自治州是一个富饶而美丽的山区，境内武陵山脉南北绵亘，气候暖和，常年气温在摄氏十七度左右，年降雨量一千二百公厘，土质肥沃，青草四季常绿，溪河泉井密布，到处都有参天蔽日的森林。在这幅员辽阔、地广人稀的山区，每人可以分到的田、土荒山平均在十六亩以上。我们计划把全州耕田变为水田，争取在三、五年内达到或超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产粮食八百斤的指标，这个计划是完全有信心实现的。全州除出产水稻、小麦、红薯、玉米等粮食作物外，还出产各种土特产品和畜产品三百六十多种，药材一百多种。其中有驰名国内外市场的桐油、茶油、油漆、木材、白蜡、娃娃鱼等。在大力发展农业生产的同时，我们也将全面大力地发展经济林，发展养猪、养蜂和繁殖牛羊。在畜牧业方面，一九五八年计划喂养生猪一百二十二万头，达到每户三头多，比去年增加百分之三十；耕牛发展到二十七万多头，山羊发展到五万多只。
    山区历来是交通阻塞、文化和技术比较落后的，每年有五分之一的劳动日花费在运输上，就是这样，也还有一些地区出产的木材、土特产品和粮食等难以外运。因此，发展山区的交通，打破旧的耕作习惯，推行技术改革，是发展山区生产的重要问题。解放几年来，我们在这方面已取得了不少成绩。现在，全州公路通车的里程比一九五二年增加一倍，除两个县外都能通汽车了。在耕作技术方面，经过三年来的试种推广，打破了自治州不种双季稻的旧习惯，在去年推广种植了十一万多亩双季稻，今年计划增加到二十七万多亩。试种天水田早稻十一万九千多亩；过去群众都不习惯沤凼，经过干部亲自下田，带头做出样子，组织参观，现在群众也都开始沤凼堆肥了。建设山区的困难，是阻挡不住各族人民革命力量的。我们有决心也有信心来克服困难，早日把山区建设成为幸福的乐园，大力发展山区的生产，更加有力地支援祖国的社会主义建设。
   党的领导　民族团结　社会主义是少数民族幸福生活的保证
    少数民族地区的一切建设成就，都是在伟大的共产党领导下，在各族人民亲密团结、互相帮助下，以及在取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利的基础上获得的。少数民族人民从自己亲身的经历中，特别深切地体会到：党的领导、民族团结、走社会主义道路，这是少数民族人民走向幸福生活的保证。去年夏天，在党进行整风运动的时候，一些右派分子，他们打着“关心”少数民族的幌子，披着民族外衣，在少数民族人民、特别是在少数民族知识分子中，挑拨民族团结，煽动少数民族离开党的领导，离开社会主义道路。右派分子潘光旦、向达和土家族右派分子彭泊，曾在湘西各族人民中间，用尽各种阴谋诡计，煽动民族分裂，破坏民族团结。但是，在觉悟了的各族人民面前，右派分子在民族问题上的反党、反社会主义的阴谋活动，也像他们在其它问题上一样，遭到彻底地失败了。我们地区的少数民族人民通过这一场反击右派的斗争，社会主义觉悟更加地提高了。湘西土家族、苗族自治州在反击右派胜利的基础上，已于去年十月正式成立。各民族的亲密团结更加增强和巩固了。
    开展整风和社会主义教育运动
    彻底批判和揭露地方民族主义
    在这一次整风和反右派的斗争中，也确实暴露了在一部分少数民族知识分子和干部中存在着严重的地方民族主义的思想和情绪，右派分子正是利用了这种思想情绪，进行阴谋活动。他们在民族区域自治问题上，主张“往外并”或“单独干”；他们借口自治机关民族化，排斥汉族干部，排斥共产党的领导；他们借口民族特点，故步自封，不求进步，甚至拒绝走社会主义道路。地方民族主义者实际上是要破坏民族团结和阻碍少数民族前进，他们和社会主义、共产主义是绝不相容的，因此，我们必须坚决予以反对，彻底揭露批判，并且坚决和这些倾向作斗争，从而肃清地方民族主义的思想影响。邓小平同志在党的八届三中全会上所作的关于整风运动的报告中指出：“在一切已经基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的少数民族地区和少数民族人口中，应该同样进行社会主义教育，并且适当地进行反右派斗争。”“在少数民族中的社会主义教育和反右派斗争，除了同汉族地区相同的内容以外，还应该着重反对民族主义倾向。”这个指示完全符合我们地区的情况，我们已经逐步地展开了整风运动和社会主义教育运动，并正在采取有效措施，使整风和社会主义教育运动搞深、搞透。
    各位代表，我们相信在共产党和毛主席的领导下，在各民族亲密团结下，一致努力，艰苦奋斗，我们一定能够把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的现代化的社会主义强国。
