Xinhua News Agency, February 20th Dispatch from Moscow (TASS): The Soviet National Cotton Growers Conference was held on February 18th and 19th in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow.

More than two thousand cotton growers from the Central Asian republics, Kazakhstan, and the South Caucasus participated in the conference. Agricultural scientists and experts from China, Democratic Korea, Afghanistan, and Burma were also invited to attend the conference.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered the opening speech at the conference. He first congratulated the workers from various regions who participated in the conference. He said that in 1957, the Soviet Union produced 4,355,000 tons of cotton, which is nearly six times that of 1913.

Khrushchev pointed out that the central issue of concern at this conference should be to increase the yield per unit area of cotton and expand cotton production, mechanize cotton planting work, minimize manual labor, and reduce costs. Khrushchev said that increased production of cotton, grain, and other crops will help to successfully solve the tasks of communist construction and further improve the material living standards of the Soviet people.

In his opening speech, Khrushchev also pointed out that this conference is a clear demonstration of the victory of Lenin's national policy. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has implemented Lenin's legacy, uniting all ethnic groups of the Soviet Union into a strong family.

Forty people spoke at the conference. Many people talked about the tasks of further developing the cotton industry. Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, Kamalov, reported at the conference that last year, the Republic of Uzbekistan supplied 2.8 million tons of cotton to the state. Before 1965, the collective farms and state farms of Uzbekistan would achieve an annual production of 4 million tons of raw cotton. It is planned to increase the yield per unit area of cotton by about 25% to 30%, expand the irrigated area by 600,000 to 700,000 hectares, thereby bringing the total irrigated area of cotton to 1.6 million hectares.

Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, Uljabayev, said that for most collective farms in Tajikistan, harvesting 30 to 35 quintals of cotton per hectare has become a common phenomenon. Here, the proportion of fine-staple varieties in the total cotton harvest has greatly increased. Compared with the pre-war period, the labor consumed to produce one quintal of cotton has been reduced by almost 60%.

Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich said in his speech that, according to the speeches of the conference participants, the Soviet Union will harvest more than 6.2 million tons of cotton this year, which is almost 50% more than last year's cotton production. Matskevich said that the Soviet Union has decided to expand the cotton planting area, and in Kazakhstan alone, it is preparing to reclaim about 300,000 hectares of virgin land for cotton planting.

The conference participants adopted a letter of guarantee for the further development of the cotton industry. The letter of guarantee stated, "We believe that in the peaceful competition with capitalist countries, our task is to at least double cotton production in the next twelve to fifteen years, so that the total cotton harvest in the Soviet Union reaches 9 million to 10 million tons."

Soviet party and government leaders Aristov, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Kosygin, and Pervukhin all participated in the conference.

    扩大棉花生产  使植棉机械化
    苏联举行全国植棉者会议
    今年收获量将比去年多百分五十
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联全国植棉者会议18日和19日在莫斯科大克里姆林宫举行。
    参加这次会议的有来自中亚细亚各共和国、哈萨克、南高加索等地的两千多名植棉者。中国、民主朝鲜、阿富汗和缅甸等国的农业科学家和专家也应邀参加了会议。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在会上致了开幕词。他首先向参加会议的各地劳动者致贺。他说，1957年苏联生产了四百三十五万五千吨棉花，差不多为1913年的六倍。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，这次会议注意的中心问题应当是提高棉花单位面积产量和扩大棉花生产，使植棉工作机械化，最大限度地减少手工劳动量，降低成本。赫鲁晓夫说，棉花、谷物和其他作物的增产，将有助于顺利解决共产主义建设的任务，进一步提高苏联人民的物质生活水平。
    赫鲁晓夫在开幕词中还指出，这次会议是列宁的民族政策胜利的明证。苏联共产党执行了列宁的遗训，把苏联各族人民团结成为一个强大的大家庭。
    在这次会议上发言的有四十人。许多人谈到进一步发展植棉业的任务。乌兹别克共产党中央委员会书记卡马洛夫在会上报告说，去年乌兹别克共和国供给国家二百八十万吨棉花。在1965年以前，乌兹别克的集体农庄和国营农场要使原棉年产量达到四百万吨。预定要把棉花的单位面积产量提高25％到30％左右，扩大灌溉面积六十万到七十万公顷，从而使棉花的受灌溉总面积达到一百六十万公顷。
    塔吉克共和国共产党中央委员会书记乌尔贾巴耶夫说，对塔吉克的大多数集体农庄来说，每公顷收获三十到三十五公担棉花已经是一种普通现象。这里在棉花的总收获量中，细绒品种的比重大大增加了。同战前比较，生产一公担棉花所耗费的劳动几乎减少了60％。
    苏联农业部长马茨凯维奇在发言中说，根据会议参加者的发言看来，苏联今年将收获六百二十万吨以上的棉花，这几乎要比去年的棉花产量多50％。马茨凯维奇说，苏联决定扩大棉花播种面积，单是在哈萨克就准备开垦约三十万公顷的生荒地来种植棉花。
    会议参加者通过了进一步发展植棉业的保证书。保证书中说，我们认为在同资本主义国家的和平竞赛中我们的任务是在今后十二年到十五年内把棉花生产至少增加一倍，即使苏联的棉花总收获量达到九百万吨到一千万吨。
    苏联党政领导人阿里斯托夫、布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、库西宁、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、柯西金、别尔乌辛都参加了这次会议。
