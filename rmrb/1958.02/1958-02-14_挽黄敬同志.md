	In Memory of Comrade Huang Jing
	Deng Tuo
	From dreams I wake in sudden fright, soul afar has flown,
	At the cold window, old friendships I recall, feelings newly shown.
	On Wutai Mountain, beacons blazed to heaven's height;
	Across the land, the battle hymns of all the fields did sound.
	Twenty years now history's page has claimed;
	A fragrant incense, one petal, for your loyalty renowned.
	The new tide surges ever higher today,
	The revolutionary Long March continues on its way.

    挽黄敬同志
    邓拓千
    里飞魂入梦惊，寒窗猛忆故人情。
    五台烽火连天壮；四野战歌匝地鸣。
    往事廿年归史传；心香一瓣吊忠贞。
    新潮今日方高涨，革命长征又一程。
