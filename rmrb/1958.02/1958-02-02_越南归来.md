Returning from Vietnam
By Our Correspondents Zhan Chao and Xiao Guang

Why are the relations between our two peoples so close and inseparable? Why do the Vietnamese people have such deep love for their neighboring brothers? Is it because of the thousands of miles of contiguous territory between the two countries? Or is it the mutual influence and transmission of culture and economic life since ancient times?

Indeed, these reasons cannot be ignored.

Opening a map, you can see the long border lines connecting the two countries, mountains linking mountains and rivers linking rivers. Whether you cross into Vietnam from Guangxi or Yunnan, you will find the mountains, rivers, and landscapes on both sides so similar: the same mountainous peaks, the same small bridges and flowing water, houses surrounded by banana trees and bamboo groves; the Zhuang people on this side and the Tho people on that side, wearing the same dark blue cloth short shirts and trousers, tied with black headscarves, carrying cloth bags embroidered with the same black Ruyi patterns, even their languages are very similar; the Dai people on this side and the Thai people on that side are both equally good at singing and dancing. … If you don't carefully identify the insignia and uniforms of the border guards, it is simply difficult to realize which side of the border you are on. No wonder a Chinese female comrade who went to Hanoi to work as a teacher was still asking, "Is Friendship Pass almost here?" even after the train had entered Vietnamese territory for more than ten minutes.

As for the origins of the relationship between the Chinese and Vietnamese nations, according to scholars' research, it can be traced back 4,800 years. And the diplomatic relations between the two countries began as early as 3,000 years ago. It is said that in 1109 BC, the State of Việt Thường sent envoys to present white pheasants to King Cheng of Zhou, and the Duke of Zhou made a compass cart to send the envoys of Việt Thường back to their country. Even temporarily putting aside these ancient historical materials, in modern life, it is not difficult to see the influence of the close relationship between the two countries in history. Not to mention that the older generation of intellectuals in Vietnam are mostly proficient in Chinese studies, and most of the younger people have also read classical literary works such as "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Philosophers talk about "Zhuangzi," "Analects," and "Lunheng" in a well-organized manner; doctors of traditional Vietnamese medicine always have a copy of Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" on their desks. Famous historical sites scattered throughout Vietnam retain stone plaques and archways inscribed in Chinese; in many folk legends and stories, many characters and locations are in China. In Vietnam, we celebrate the Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival every year as we do at home; and when appreciating Vietnamese ancient operas, the brocade robes and embroidered clothes, drumming and flute playing, and zither playing and applause often make people naturally think of our Cantonese opera and Peking opera.

The interconnected and similar economic and cultural life enhances mutual understanding and trust. However, this is not the whole answer. What is more important is the shared adversity of the Chinese and Vietnamese people in recent centuries: you see, the story of the Black Flag Army working with Vietnamese troops to defeat the French devils, after so many years, is still recited by Vietnamese men, women, old and young.

What is more important is that our two peoples have experienced the same smoke and flames of war on the road to socialism: the famous Vietnamese historian Tran Huy Lieu specifically mentioned this, he said: "After the October Revolution, the Vietnamese revolution and the Chinese revolution both opened a new era. The establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary upsurge of 1925-1927 were like a strong sea breeze blowing into Vietnam. The predecessor of the Indochinese Communist Party—the Vietnam Youth Revolutionary Comrades Association—took Guangzhou as its initial base, and from then on established foundations throughout Vietnam. At that time, many huge changes in the world were introduced into Vietnam through China. The vast number of Vietnamese youth breathed fresh air from the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, the Northern Expedition, and the Guangzhou Commune; these new ideals soon turned into revolutionary driving forces, prompting everyone to form organizations, and finally promoted the storm of the Vietnamese revolution between 1925 and 1929."

When the old revolutionary fighters of Vietnam talk about the early days, they often say: Our party is nine years younger than the Chinese Communist Party, but when the comrades just raised the flag of the sickle and hammer and entered the battle, they felt unparalleled confidence and strength. This is not only because we felt that we were fighting side by side with the proletariat and oppressed nations of the whole world, but also because we had the most reliable brothers and friends by our side—the great Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese worker-peasant masses!

For these old comrades, the history of the past thirty years is connected with personal and intimate memories, which are interspersed with many events full of internationalist spirit! French colonialists and Chinese warlords colluded many times to suppress the Vietnamese revolution and search for Vietnamese revolutionaries on Chinese territory; but the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples always helped each other and united closely. The Vietnamese working class organized strikes during our country's first revolutionary civil war to support our people's struggle; during the Anti-Japanese War, when our country's coast was blockaded by the Japanese invading army, the Vietnamese people transported military supplies from Haiphong to our country via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway….

Everyone remembers how much joy and excitement the Chinese people felt when they welcomed the victory of the Vietnamese August Revolution; and the Vietnamese people celebrated the birth of New China as if they were celebrating their own victory. A Vietnamese youth who worked as a telegraph operator still keeps a pair of damaged headphones, just because on October 1, 1949, he used them to listen to the grand occasion in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and heard Chairman Mao Zedong solemnly declare: "The Chinese people have stood up!" What kind of inspiration and encouragement did this strong and incomparable voice, which shook the world, give to the Vietnamese people, who were in extremely difficult circumstances at the time! President Ho Chi Minh firmly predicted: "The colonialists in Vietnam will also suffer a miserable defeat, just like in China!" After more than half a year of preparation, the heroic Vietnamese People's Army finally wiped out nine battalions of the French army in the entire northeast border, making the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam have a vast rear area in northern Vietnam, connected to the entire socialist camp.

The "Zhennanguan" on the Sino-Vietnamese border was changed to "Friendship Pass"; President Ho Chi Minh wrote a poem entitled "Only Changing One Word" to sing the friendship between the people of the two countries entering a new stage. Naturally, the French colonialists and American interventionists knew very well what the friendly unity between China and Vietnam meant to them, so they did everything they could to sow discord, distributing a large number of leaflets in the French-occupied areas, saying that New China would follow the feudal dynasties of Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing and come to bully Vietnam again…. But these lies could not stand the test of facts, people quietly cut out the portraits of President Ho and Chairman Mao printed on the leaflets and hid them deeply; while those colorful reactionary leaflets were thrown into the trash.

In the liberated areas, Vietnamese cadres, under the initiative of President Ho Chi Minh, worked hard to study Marxism-Leninism and delve into the experience of the Soviet revolution and construction. At the same time, Vietnamese cadres also had great interest in the experience of the Chinese revolution and construction in various aspects. As many as thirty or forty kinds of Chinese revolutionary documents were translated into Vietnamese in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, many of which were personally translated by President Ho.

The deep friendship of the Vietnamese people for the Chinese people is often concentrated in the respect and love for Chairman Mao Zedong. It is remembered that Luo Wenqiu, a national combat hero of Vietnam, was surrounded by his comrades when he returned to the army because he had embraced Chairman Mao when he visited China, and he was embraced tightly one by one. What a strong affection is contained in this, it cannot but be exciting.

"Brotherly friendship," we have often heard this term in the past and often used it, but it was only during the days spent in Vietnam that life taught us to understand its true meaning more deeply. (End) (Attached picture)

　　越南归来
　　本报记者　展潮　萧光
    我们两国人民的关系何以如此亲密无间？越南人民何以对自己的邻家弟兄怀着如此至深的爱？是由于两国领土的千里毗连？还是自古以来文化和经济生活的相互影响、流传？
    的确，这些原因都不容忽视。
    打开地图就能看见连接两国绵长的国境线，它们是山连着山、水连着水。不论你从广西或云南过境入越南，都会发现两边的山川风物多么酷似：一个样的山地的峰峦、一个样的小桥、流水，芭蕉和竹林环绕的人家；这边的僮族和那边的土族，穿着一式毛蓝布的短衫、长裤，扎着黑头巾，挎着同样绣有黑如意的布袋，甚至语言都大同小异；这边的傣族和那边的泰族，都是一样的能歌善舞。……如果你不认真辨认边防战士的徽号、服饰，简直很难意识到自己究竟在边界的哪一边。难怪一位到河内去做教师的中国女同志，当列车驶入了越南国境十多分钟之久，还在打听：“睦南关快到了没有？”
    至于中国和越南民族关系的渊源，按照学者们的考证，可以追溯到四千八百年前。而两国的邦交，也早在三千多年前已经开始。据说，在公元前1109年，越裳国派遣使节带白雉赠送周成王，周公旦又制造指南车送越裳国使者回国。就是暂时撇开这些古老的历史材料不谈，在现代的生活当中，也不难看出两国历史上密切关系的影响。且不说越南老一辈的知识分子大都通晓汉学，年轻些的人也多半读过“水浒”、“红楼梦”、“三国演义”之类的古典文学作品。哲学家谈起“庄子”、“论语”、“论衡”来，头头是道；东医的案头上少不了有一册李时珍的“本草纲目”。散布在越南各地的名胜古迹，保留着题有中文的石匾、牌坊；许多民间传说、故事中，不少人物和地点是在中国的。我们在越南，年年像在国内一样地过春节、端午和中秋；而当欣赏越南古戏的时候，那锦袍绣衣、击鼓吹箫和弹琴抚掌等等常使人自然而然地想起我国的粤剧和京剧。
    相通相近的经济和文化生活，增进着彼此的了解和信任。然而，这还不是答案的全部。更重要的是中越两国人民在近世纪以来的患难与共：你看，黑旗军协同越南部队大破法国鬼子的故事，过去多少年了，今天仍被越南的男女老少传诵着。
    更重要的是我们两国人民在走向社会主义的途程中，经历了同样的烽烟和战火：越南著名的历史学家陈辉燎特别谈起过这一点，他说：“十月革命以后，越南革命和中国革命都揭开了一个新纪元。中国共产党的成立和1925—1927年的革命高潮，就像一阵强烈的海风吹到了越南。印度支那共产党的前身——越南青年革命同志会，就以广州为最初的策源地，并从此在越南全国各地建立了基础。当时，世界上许多巨大的变化都经过中国传入越南。广大的越南青年从“五四”、“五卅”、北伐和广州公社等运动中呼吸到新鲜的空气；这些新的理想，不久就化为革命的动力，推动大家结成组织，终于在1925—1929年间促成了越南革命的风暴。”
    越南革命的老战士们，谈起早先的情况时，常说：我们的党比中国共产党小九岁，但是当同志们刚一举起镰刀锤头的旗帜、投入战斗的时候，就感到无比的信心和力量。这不仅因为我们觉着自己是在同全世界的无产阶级和被压迫民族并肩作战，而且在我们身旁就有着最可靠的兄弟和朋友——伟大的中国共产党和中国工农群众！
    对于这些老同志，近三十年来的历史，是和个人亲切的回忆连接在一起的，其中又贯串着多少充满着国际主义精神的事件啊！法国殖民主义者和中国军阀多少次勾结起来镇压越南革命，在中国国土上搜捕越南革命者；但中、越两国人民永远互相帮助，紧密团结。越南工人阶级在我国第一次国内革命战争中，就组织罢工来声援我国人民的斗争；抗日战争时期，我国海岸遭到日本侵略军的封锁，越南人民就把军事物资从海防经滇越铁路运进我国……。
    谁都记得，我国人民曾怀着多大的喜悦和兴奋迎接越南八月革命的胜利；而越南人民也像庆祝自己的胜利那样欢庆新中国的诞生。一位当过报务员的越南青年，至今还保存着一副破损的耳机，只因为1949年10月1日他曾用它来收听过北京天安门的盛况，听见毛泽东主席庄严地宣告：“中国人民站起来了！”这个震撼全世界的坚强无比的声音，给了当时境遇极度艰难的越南人民什么样的振奋和鼓舞啊！胡志明主席坚定地预言：“殖民主义者在越南也将和在中国一样，遭受到惨败的结局！”经过半年多的准备，英勇的越南人民军终于在东北边界全部消灭了法军九个营，使得年轻的越南民主共和国有了越北广阔的后方，同整个社会主义阵营连成一片。
    中、越边境的“镇南关”改成了“睦南关”；胡志明主席以“只改一个字”为题写诗歌唱两国人民的友好关系进入新的阶段。自然，法国殖民者和美国干涉者很懂得中、越的友好团结对它们意味着什么，因此极尽挑拨离间之能事，在法占区大量散播传单，说什么新中国将继汉、唐、元、明、清等封建王朝之后，又来欺侮越南……。可是这些谎话是经不起事实考验的，人们悄悄地把传单上印载的胡主席和毛主席像剪下来，深深地藏起；而那些五颜六色的反动传单却被抛到垃圾堆里去了。
    在解放区，越南干部在胡志明主席的倡导下，努力学习马克思列宁主义、钻研苏联革命和建设的经验。同时越南干部对中国革命建设各方面的经验，也怀抱着极大的兴趣。中国革命文献被译成越文的，抗战初期就有三、四十种，其中不少是胡主席亲自翻译的。
    越南人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，常常集中在对毛泽东主席的敬爱中，记得越南全国战斗英雄罗文求因为访问中国时和毛主席拥抱过，他回到部队时被战友团团地包围住，一个接一个地紧紧地拥抱了一遍。这里面蕴藏着多么浓重的情意啊，它不能不令人心神激动。
    “兄弟般的友情”，这个名词我们过去常听说，也常用到，但只是在越南度过的这段日子里，生活却教会了我们更深刻地领会它的真谛。　（完）（附图片）
