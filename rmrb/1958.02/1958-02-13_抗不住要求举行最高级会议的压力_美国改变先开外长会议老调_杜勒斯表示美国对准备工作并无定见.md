Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on the 11th, regarding the summit meeting that people all over the world urgently demand, that U.S. President Eisenhower is currently considering a reply to Bulganin's recent letter. After this reply is drafted, there will probably be further discussion on how to proceed. At the same time, Dulles still emphasized the need to establish a "procedure" on the issue of the summit meeting to "satisfy" the preconditions put forward by Eisenhower in his January reply to Bulganin for holding such a meeting, that is, there must be "sufficient preparation" and a "good hope" of obtaining positive results.

Due to the widespread condemnation around the world of the U.S. position of obstructing the smooth convening of a summit meeting, and the dissatisfaction expressed by some of its "allies," Dulles had to lower the tone on the U.S. preconditions. He said that "we (the United States) have no fixed ideas about how the preparation work (for the summit meeting) should be done." The United States insists that a foreign ministers' meeting held beforehand "is not essential."

However, Dulles also said that he believes that the opinion that it is "almost" impossible to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union "has not changed." He said, "I very much doubt whether things will become easier as long as we are actually trying to reach an agreement that is beneficial to the United States." Dulles's words revealed the U.S.'s purpose in holding negotiations.

Speaking of the situation in the Far East, Dulles stated that the United States is not prepared to make "any significant reductions" in its troops stationed in South Korea. Moreover, the United States believes that the provisions in the Korean Armistice Agreement prohibiting the import of reinforcing weapons are no longer "binding" on the United States, and the United States will continue to ship more modern equipment into South Korea, as it does now, to arm the troops of the Syngman Rhee puppet government.

Dulles blatantly interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs. In a viciously provocative and inflammatory tone, he said: "The islands outside Java are uneasy about the growing influence of the Communist Party on the Javanese government," and "this uneasiness has already been expressed." He said that the U.S. government is "watching with concern" the current situation in Indonesia. Dulles also said that the United States hopes to see a "constitutional government" in Indonesia, "a government that can reflect the true interests and desires of the Indonesian people." He attacked President Sukarno's proposed "guided democracy" and slandered it as "not entirely in accordance with (Indonesia's) provisional constitution." Dulles also said in an obviously provocative tone that "the current influence of the Communist Party on the Indonesian government" is "growing."

When a reporter asked Dulles whether he thought the French bombing of Tunisia constituted a crime of aggression against another country, he merely repeated France's explanation of the matter and refused to state the U.S.'s view. Dulles did not dare to deny that many of the weapons France used for colonial suppression in North Africa were U.S. equipment, and therefore he admitted that this bombing incident could not be said to have "nothing to do with" the United States. He said that the United States currently hopes to "minimize" this incident in order to avoid "affecting" the relationship between North African countries and the West.

### 抗不住要求举行最高级会议的压力  美国改变先开外长会议老调  杜勒斯表示美国对准备工作并无定见

    抗不住要求举行最高级会议的压力
    美国改变先开外长会议老调
    杜勒斯表示美国对准备工作并无定见
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯11日在记者招待会上谈到全世界人民迫切要求的最高级会议问题时说，美国总统艾森豪威尔目前正在考虑对布尔加宁最近信件的答复，在这个答复拟好以后，大概会进一步谈到如何进行的问题。同时，杜勒斯仍然强调要在最高级会议问题上定出一种“程序”，来“满足”艾森豪威尔在1月间给布尔加宁的复信中为举行这样一次会议提出的先决条件，即必须有“充分的准备”和有获得积极结果的“良好希望”。
    由于美国阻挠最高级会议顺利召开的立场在全世界受到广泛谴责而它的某些“盟国”也对此表示不满，杜勒斯不得不在美国的先决条件上放低调子。他说，“对于（最高级会议）准备工作应当怎样做，我们（美国）并无定见。美国坚持事前举行的外长会议“不是必不可少的”。
    但是，杜勒斯又说，他认为“几乎”不可能同苏联举行谈判的意见“并没改变”。他说，“我非常怀疑，只要我们实际上是在设法达成有利于美国的协议，事情是否会变得容易起来”。杜勒斯这番话道破了美国对谈判抱着什么目的。
    谈到远东局势，杜勒斯表示，美国并不准备对它驻在南朝鲜的军队作“任何重大的减少”。而且，美国认为朝鲜停战协定中关于禁止运入增援性武器的规定已经不再对美国有“约束力”，美国以后还要像现在那样把比较新式的装备运进南朝鲜来武装李承晚傀儡政府的军队。
    杜勒斯对印度尼西亚的内政进行了露骨的干涉。他以恶毒的挑拨和煽动的口气说：“爪哇以外的各岛屿对于共产党对爪哇政府的影响越来越大这一事实感到不安”，而且“这种不安已经表现出来了”。他说，美国政府正在“关切地观察”目前在印度尼西亚发生的情况。杜勒斯还说，美国希望看到印度尼西亚有一个“合乎宪法的政府”，“能够反映印度尼西亚人民的真正利益和愿望的政府”。他攻击苏加诺总统提出的“有指导的民主”，并且污蔑说这是“不十分符合（印度尼西亚）临时宪法的”。杜勒斯还以明显的挑拨口吻说，“目前共产党对印度尼西亚政府的影响”“越来越大”。
    有记者问杜勒斯是否认为法国轰炸突尼斯是对另一个国家犯了侵略罪，他只是重述法国对这件事情的解释，而拒绝说明美国的看法。杜勒斯不敢否认，法国用来在北非进行殖民镇压的武器有很多是美国装备，因而他承认这次轰炸事件不能说同美国“没有什么关系”。他说，美国目前希望把这个事件“缩小到最低限度”，以免“影响”北非国家同西方的关系。
