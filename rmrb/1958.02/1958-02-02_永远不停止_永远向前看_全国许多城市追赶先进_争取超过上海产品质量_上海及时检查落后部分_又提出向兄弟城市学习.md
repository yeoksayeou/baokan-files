　　Never Stop, Always Look Forward
    Many Cities Across the Country Catch Up with the Advanced, Striving to Surpass Shanghai's Product Quality
    Shanghai Promptly Examines Backward Areas and Proposes Learning from Brother Cities

    Our Newspaper Shanghai, January 1st Dispatch (Reporter Ji Yin): Shanghai, this important industrial base, is now at the forefront of the "compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced" competition among cities across the country, becoming a common object of friendly competition among cities. This is what Shanghai's industrial sector discovered after recently analyzing the current situation of the high tide of industrial production. According to preliminary materials here, many factories in more than a dozen cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Changsha, Ningbo, and Suzhou, have challenged Shanghai. They have designated the highest level of one or several indicators of a certain product in Shanghai as their goal, determined to catch up with and surpass them in the short term. This friendly competition between various regions within the country has become a new surge in the current high tide of industrial production in Shanghai.

    The factories challenging Shanghai from various places include various industries and factories of various sizes, covering an extremely wide range. However, according to comrades in Shanghai's industrial sector, Shanghai's strongest rivals are Tianjin and Guangzhou, and the friendly competition between these two brother cities and Shanghai has been extremely fierce in recent years. Recently, the Guangzhou Light Industry Bureau formally proposed at a cadre meeting that the more than 130 factories under the bureau should comprehensively catch up with and surpass Shanghai's level in terms of the quality of light industrial products within this year. Many factories in Tianjin have also proposed such goals. There are also many factories that, although they have not formally issued a challenge, are actually engaged in competition. According to recent inspections, many industrial products in Tianjin and Guangzhou have surpassed Shanghai in different aspects. Tianjin's leather balls, inks, bicycles, printed underwear, cotton yarn, printing and dyeing, and other products have surpassed Shanghai's similar products in some aspects. Guangzhou's flashlights, batteries, sewing machines, knitted underwear, spray paint, and other products are also superior to Shanghai's products in some aspects.

    What shocked Shanghai's industrial sector the most was that many of the regions that recently challenged Shanghai are some small and medium-sized cities that have only recently built or developed modern industries. This time, Hangzhou has several factories, including Southeast Chemical Factory, Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory, Hangzhou Power Plant, and Huafeng Paper Mill, which, after comparing and analyzing their products with similar products in Shanghai, decided to catch up with Shanghai's highest level. Hangzhou Power Plant will catch up with the nationally renowned Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant in terms of safe power generation, coal consumption, and technical management level within two years. Hangzhou Southeast Chemical Factory will raise the quality of its "Ship Brand" soap to the same level as Shanghai's nationally renowned "Guben Soap" this year. A factory in Ningbo with only twenty workers producing ballpoint pens has also set out measures to bring the quality of its ballpoint pens to the level of the current national famous brand – the "Fenghua" ballpoint pen made in Shanghai – within one year. In fact, some aspects of some industrial products in these small and medium-sized cities have already reached or even surpassed Shanghai's similar products. Hunan's batteries have surpassed Shanghai in terms of variety and lighting time. The quality of Shanghai's celluloid has fallen behind Luzhou, Sichuan. The variety of patterns of Shanghai's fancy socks is not as good as Nanhui, Jiangsu. Other places such as Hangzhou, Yantai, Shantou, and Jinan also have a small number of products that have surpassed Shanghai in some aspects. Some of these factories only started coming to Shanghai a few years ago to learn manufacturing technology, and now their products have surpassed the factories where they studied in Shanghai.

    Of course, in general, Shanghai's industrial level is still advanced, and Shanghai's industrial production has made great progress in recent years. The quality of many products is still at the forefront of the country. In particular, many light industrial products are not only the best in the country, but also enjoy a high reputation in the international market. According to the analysis and comparison of the industrial sector, there are still few products in Shanghai that are completely behind other regions; the more common situation is that some indicators of a product are behind brother regions. Last year, Shanghai exchanged 282 experiences on improving product quality and reducing product costs with Shenyang, Beijing, and Tianjin in the local mechanical and electrical industries. Shanghai had 174 items that were more advanced than them, and 108 items that were inferior to brother regions, which needed to be learned from them. The situation in the chemical industry, light industry, and textile industry is roughly the same. In the textile industry, some indicators such as evenness of yarn are not as good as the advanced level of Qingdao Textile Factory. In light industry, the quality, variety, or other aspects of several products such as enamel, alarm clocks, leather balls, accordions, flashlights, and red and blue pencils are inferior to similar advanced products in Dalian, Yantai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Jinan. In the chemical industry, the advanced level of celluloid, paint, tires, direct dyes, and other items has fallen behind the advanced level of Taiyuan, Dalian, Shenyang, and Tianjin in some aspects. These are the conclusions reached by Shanghai's industrial sector after conducting a comprehensive analysis and comparison of its own and foreign products recently. These unquestionable conclusions made the comrades in Shanghai's industrial sector both excited and nervous. What is exciting is the gratifying leap in industrial production in various brother regions, and what is nervous is the increasing pressure on Shanghai that comes with it.

    In fact, this "compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced" competition among cities, centered on Shanghai, has already begun a few years ago. In recent years, industrial departments in many cities have sent people to Shanghai to learn, especially Tianjin and Guangzhou, who have come most frequently. They often led by leading cadres, summarized Shanghai's advanced experience factory by factory, and then brought it back to combine it with the local situation and seriously promoted it, so that their products could be rapidly improved. This kind of learning reached its largest scale in 1956 when Shanghai held an exhibition of advanced experience. Sixty-two cities and towns across the country sent more than 10,000 cadres and workers to observe various advanced experiences at the exhibition, and these experiences later blossomed and bore fruit everywhere.

    Comrades in Shanghai's industrial sector said in a recent inspection that the problem lies in the fact that Shanghai did not realize that this learning activity also meant a friendly competition when receiving brothers from various regions who came to learn. They only saw the side of other regions coming to learn, but ignored the side that they were not as good as others. They were only busy receiving others who came to learn, but ignored that they should also go to other places to learn from their strengths.

    The Industry Working Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a cadre meeting to encourage cadres to formulate active measures after comparative analysis, strengthen the work of exchanging experiences with various places, catch up with those who have fallen behind, and strive to be more advanced for those who are still leading. Now, Shanghai's industrial departments have taken action one after another. They thank the encouragement of their brother regions and are determined to accept their friendly challenges. The Light Industry Bureau held more than ten days of meetings in a row, proposing that 29 products, such as sewing machines, accordions, and enamel, which are lagging behind other regions in certain indicators, should catch up with the advanced level of other regions within one year. The East China Textile Administration Bureau also held a factory director meeting, deciding that some backward indicators of Shanghai's textiles should quickly catch up with Qingdao, and the evenness of cotton yarn and the uniformity of count should reach Qingdao's advanced indicators in the fourth quarter of this year. All industrial competent bureaus are brewing to send people to other places to learn the advanced experience of brother factories. The Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau and the Textile Industry Bureau have decided to organize a group of technicians to go to the Northeast, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places to study in the second quarter.

    In the vast factories of Shanghai, there is now a chorus of responding to challenges. Many factories that received the challenge have held employee meetings and sent letters of response to brother factories in other places, expressing their willingness to launch a friendly competition with them in order to advance together.

　　永远不停止　永远向前看
    全国许多城市追赶先进　争取超过上海产品质量
    上海及时检查落后部分　又提出向兄弟城市学习
    本报上海1日电　记者季音报道：上海，这个重要的工业基地，现在正处在全国各城市之间“比先进，学先进，赶先进”竞赛的尖端上，成为各城市之间友谊竞赛的一个共同对象。这是上海工业部门在最近分析了当前工业生产高潮的形势之后发现的。根据此间的初步材料，现在已经有北京、天津、广州、武汉、杭州、长沙、宁波、苏州等十多个城市的许多工厂，向上海提出了挑战。他们指定以上海某种产品一项或几项指标的最高水平，作为自己的奋斗目标，决心要在短期内赶上和超过它们。这个国内各个地区之间的友谊竞赛，已经成为当前上海工业生产高潮中的一股新的激流。
    各地向上海挑战的工厂，包括了各种不同的行业，各种大小不等的工厂，范围极为广泛。但是据上海工业部门的同志说，上海的劲敌是天津和广州，这两个兄弟城市几年来同上海之间的友谊竞赛是极为激烈的。最近，广州轻工业局在一次干部会上已经正式提出，这个局所属的一百三十多个工厂，要在今年一年内在轻工业品的质量方面全面地赶上和超过上海的水平。天津也有不少工厂提出了这样的目标。也有许多工厂虽然没有正式提出挑战，而实际上却在进行着竞赛。据最近检查，天津和广州已有不少工业品在不同的方面赶过了上海。天津的球革、油墨、自行车、印花内衣、棉纱、印染等产品，在某些方面都已胜过上海的同类产品。广州的手电筒、电池、缝纫机、针织内衣、喷漆等产品，也已在某些方面优于上海的产品。
    使上海工业部门震动最大的是：最近向上海提出挑战的地区中，有不少是最近几年才建设或者发展起近代工业的一些中小城市。杭州这次有东南化工厂、杭州棉纺织厂、杭州电厂、华丰造纸厂等几个厂，在与上海同类产品作了对比分析之后，决定要赶上上海的最高水平。杭州电厂要在二年内，在安全发电、煤耗、技术管理水平等三方面赶上全国闻名的上海杨树浦发电厂。杭州东南化工厂要在今年把本厂“船牌”肥皂的质量，提高到全国闻名的上海“固本皂”的同等水平。宁波一家只有二十个工人的生产圆珠笔的工厂，也订出措施，要在一年内把圆珠笔的质量达到目前全国的名牌——上海造的“丰华”圆珠笔的水平。而事实上，这些中小城市目前已经有一些工业品的某些方面，达到了甚至超过了上海的同类产品。湖南的电池，在花色品种和放光时间方面已经胜过上海。上海赛璐珞的质量已经落后于四川泸州。上海花袜的花式品种不及江苏南汇。其他如杭州、烟台、汕头、济南等地，也都有少数产品，在某些方面胜过了上海。其中有些工厂，前几年才开始到上海来学习制造技术，而现在他们的产品已经赶过了他们在上海学习的工厂。
    当然，从总的方面来说，上海的工业水平还是先进的，上海工业生产上几年来的进步很大，许多产品的质量还是走在全国之先。特别是许多轻工业产品，不但在国内第一，在国际市场上也享有很高的声誉。据工业部门的分析对比，上海完全落后于其它地区的产品还是少数；比较多的情况是一种产品的某几项指标落后于兄弟地区。上海去年曾在地方机电工业方面，同沈阳、北京、天津三个地区，交流了二百八十二项关于提高产品质量、降低产品成本的经验，上海有一百七十四项比他们先进，有一百零八项差于兄弟地区，需要向他们学习。在化学工业、轻工业、纺织工业等方面，也大致上是这样的情况。纺织工业方面，有条干均匀度等指标不如青岛纺织厂的先进水平。在轻工业方面，有搪瓷、闹钟、球革、手风琴、电筒、红蓝铅笔等几种产品，在质量、花色或其它方面次于大连、烟台、天津、重庆、广州、济南的同类先进产品。化学工业方面，有赛璐珞、油漆、轮胎、直接性染料等几项，在某些方面落到了太原、大连、沈阳、天津的先进水平之后。这些都是上海工业部门最近对本厂和外地产品进行了全面分析、比较之后得出来的结论。这些无可置疑的结论，使上海工业部门的同志又兴奋，又紧张。兴奋的是各兄弟地区这种工业生产上可喜的跃进，紧张的是由此而来的对上海越来越大的压力。
    其实，以上海为中心的、各城市之间的这种“比先进，学先进，赶先进”的竞赛，在几年前已经开始了。这几年来，许多城市的工业部门都曾派人到上海来学习，尤其是天津和广州来得最勤，他们常常由领导干部亲自率领，一个厂一个厂地总结上海的先进经验，然后带回去结合当地情况，认真推广，使自己的产品得到迅速的提高。这种学习在1956年上海举行先进经验展览会的时候，达到了最大的规模。全国曾有六十二个城镇，派出了一万多干部和工人，观摩了这个展览会上的各种先进经验，这些经验以后普遍在各地开花结果。
    上海工业部门的同志在最近的检查中说，问题在于上海在接待各兄弟地区前来学习的时候，没有认识到这种学习活动，也意味着是一种友谊的竞赛。他们只看到别的地区来学习的一面，忽略了自己还不如别人的一面，他们只忙于接待别人前来学习，而忽略了自己也应当到别的地方去学习人家的长处。
    中共上海市委工业工作部最近召开了一次干部大会，鼓励干部在对比分析以后，订出积极的措施，加强与各地交流经验的工作，已经落后的要赶上，现在还领先的，也要做到更加先进。现在，上海的工业部门已经纷纷行动起来。他们感谢各兄弟地区的鞭策，决心接受他们的友谊挑战。轻工业局连续举行了十多天会议，提出要使缝纫机、手风琴、搪瓷等二十九种在某些指标上落后于外地的产品，在一年内分别赶上外地的先进水平。华东纺织管理局也举行了厂长会议，决定要使上海纺织品的某些落后指标迅速赶过青岛，棉纱的条干均匀度和支数均匀率都要在今年第四季度达到青岛的先进指标。各工业主管局都在酝酿派人到外地学习兄弟厂的先进经验。机电工业局、纺织工业局已决定在第二季度组织一批技术人员到东北、天津、青岛等地学习。
    在上海广大工厂中，现在更是一片应战声。许多接到挑战的工厂都召开了职工大会，给外地兄弟工厂寄去了应战书，表示愿同他们展开友谊竞赛，以便共同前进。
