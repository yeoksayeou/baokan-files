Xinhua News Agency report: A movement to create and improve tools is underway at many water conservancy construction sites in Zhejiang Province. Currently, twenty-five counties, including Rui'an and Jiaxing, are promoting this movement throughout the province. Another forty-eight counties are conducting typical experiments. After the Gongnong (Worker-Peasant) Reservoir construction site in Jiande County launched a tool reform movement, the number of new tools used on the site increased day by day, the quality improved day by day, and the efficiency increased day by day. When the bamboo rails were just laid and started transporting earth, three workers from the carpentry cooperative laid another wooden rail and improved the trolley, increasing the earth transportation efficiency by double that of the bamboo rail. However, two days later, the efficiency of the wooden railcar was greatly surpassed by the bamboo rail circulating earth-sliding method.

According to statistics from the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, more than 100 types of newly created and improved tools have been developed throughout the province, of which 38 can be widely promoted in various regions. To widely exchange experiences in this area, the Water Conservancy Department is transporting some new-style tools to larger water conservancy construction sites for a traveling exhibition.

These successfully tested new-style tools have the advantages of high efficiency, low cost, simple manufacturing, and easy operation, and can increase work efficiency by one to more than ten times. The steel wire circulating earth transport method created at the Yuxi Reservoir construction site in Rui'an County can transport eighty times per hour over a distance of 120 meters. Fourteen people operate it, and each person can complete 6.58 cubic meters of earthwork per day, increasing work efficiency by more than four times. The hand-cranked mud-dragging cart in Honghe Township, Jiaxing County, can transport 14,600 jin of mud per hour, increasing work efficiency by two times compared to manual carrying, while the cost of manufacturing a complete set of tools is only a little over seven yuan.

The formation of a mass tool reform movement in water conservancy projects in various parts of Zhejiang Province is the result of further strengthening leadership by Party committees at all levels. Since Zhejiang Daily introduced the achievements of Yuxi Reservoir in Rui'an County in January, which created a variety of water conservancy tools and greatly improved water management efficiency, the county Party secretaries of thirty-four counties throughout the province have gone deep into the construction sites to study and experiment with new-style tools together with the masses, as well as new organizational forms of operation adapted to the new tools.

### 浙江水利厅组织新工具巡回展览  瑞安等县改革工具形成运动

    浙江水利厅组织新工具巡回展览
    瑞安等县改革工具形成运动
    新华社讯　浙江省许多水利工地上正在开展创造和改良工具的运动。目前，全省已有瑞安、嘉兴等二十五个县正在推广这一运动。另有四十八个县正在做典型试验。建德县工农水库工地开展改革工具运动以后，工地上使用新工具的数量一天比一天多，质量一天比一天好，效率一天比一天高。竹轨刚刚铺好开始运土时，木器社的三个工人又铺设了一条木轨，改进了推车，运土效率比竹轨提高了一倍；可是隔了两天，木轨车的工效又被竹轨循环溜土法大大超过了。
    据省水利厅统计，全省新创造和改良的工具有一百多种，其中有三十八种可以在各地普遍推广。为了广泛地交流这方面的经验，水利厅将一部分新式工具运到各地较大水利工地去巡回展览。
    这些试验成功的新式工具都具有效率高、成本低、制造简单、操作轻便等优点，能提高工效一倍到十余倍。瑞安县愚溪水库工地创造的钢丝巡回运土法，在一百二十公尺的运送距离中，每小时能运八十次，十四人操作，每人每天能做六点五八土方，提高工效四倍以上。嘉兴县洪合乡的手摇拖泥车，每小时能运泥一万四千六百斤，比用人力挑提高工效二倍，而制造全套工具只需七元多。
    浙江省各地水利工程群众性的改革工具运动的形成，是各级党委进一步加强领导的结果。自从1月间浙江日报介绍了瑞安县愚溪水库创造了多种水利工具，治水效率大大提高的成就以后，全省有三十四个县的县委书记深入工地与群众一起研究试验新式工具以及和新工具相适应的新的操作组织形式。
