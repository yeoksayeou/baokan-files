I completely agree with the various reports made to this meeting by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now, I will report on the issue of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region opposing local nationalism and realizing a Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry.

The various constructions are rapidly advancing on the general track of national construction, presenting a prosperous and happy autonomous region to the people of all ethnic groups. The rightists attempted to drag the Mongolian people back to the old road of the past, arousing great indignation among the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, and they resolutely fought back.

1957 was a year of great victories for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on all fronts. Through rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, the unity of nationalities was further strengthened, and the socialist political and economic systems were consolidated. With the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution and the decisive victory of socialist transformation, the first Five-Year Plan was fully completed and overfulfilled, and various constructions in the autonomous region are rapidly advancing on the general track of national socialist construction. A prosperous and happy autonomous region is being presented to the people of all ethnic groups. The changes that have taken place in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, changes that have not been seen for thousands of years, are truly exciting and inspiring. However, the rightists, especially the rightists among the Mongolian nationality, were blinded by greed. During the period of great blooming and contending, they put on national costumes and launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism from the perspective of ethnic relations and the Party's ethnic policies. They viciously said that "socialism is eliminating nationalities" and that "socialism is creating national assimilation." They shouted the tune of "opposing assimilation" to oppose socialist industrialization, oppose cooperativization, oppose the development of science and culture, reject the help of the Han nationality, and carry out separatist activities. They put forward the proposition of "separate rule for Mongolians and Hans" or "Mongolian independence," attempting to separate the Mongolian nationality from the big family of the motherland and from the socialist road, and to drag the Mongolian nationality back to the old reactionary road of the past. Contrary to the wishes of the rightists, their attacks and restoration plots aroused great indignation among the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region and were resolutely countered.

The tremendous achievements made during the first Five-Year Plan have fundamentally changed the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Mongolian nationality and other nationalities in the region. This shows that the Mongolian nationality cannot be separated from the help of the Han nationality and cannot be separated from the big socialist family of the motherland.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the motherland. The Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic peoples in the region have lived together for a long time, jointly developing the economy and culture. Especially in the common struggle to win national liberation and in various revolutionary periods, unbreakable brotherly friendship has been forged. This kind of ethnic relationship has been further developed and consolidated on the basis of socialist transformation. The achievements made by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the economic and cultural fields with the help of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland, especially the Han nationality, along with the development of the motherland's construction cause, are ironclad facts. As a result of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in all aspects has been a great leap forward. Grain output has reached 4.55 million tons (an increase of one and a half times compared with 1947), and the total number of livestock has reached 22.38 million head, a net increase of 6.67 million head during the first Five-Year Plan. The total industrial output value is expected to reach 630 million yuan, of which local industry accounts for 350 million yuan. The proportion of industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 12 percent in 1952 to 30 percent in 1957. The industrial output value in 1957 is equivalent to the total from 1946 to 1952. The key national construction projects in the autonomous region—Baotou Steel, the forestry industry, and railways—have promoted the economic and cultural development of the autonomous region, and a road transportation and postal and telecommunications network has been initially formed. Cultural education, especially national education, has developed rapidly, and four institutions of higher learning have been established from scratch. All these construction achievements have fundamentally changed the political, economic, and cultural outlook of the Mongolian nationality and other nationalities in the region. These facts powerfully prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and smash the slander of socialism by the rightists. Facts also prove that the Mongolian nationality cannot and should not be separated from the help of the Han nationality and cannot be separated from the whole of the socialist motherland in its political, economic, and cultural development.

In recent years, we have resettled a considerable number of immigrants, which has played a good role in promoting the development of production and construction in the autonomous region. In the future, we will continue to welcome and help fraternal nationalities immigrate to Inner Mongolia to settle down. We oppose national separatism and oppose national division. Because national division is, in essence, undermining the unity of the big family of the motherland, which is beneficial to imperialism and capitalism and detrimental to national and socialist construction, and the result is the restoration of the old system. Strengthening national unity and jointly building socialism is the highest interest of the people of all ethnic groups. Only with national unity and the unity of all fraternal nationalities in the country can our cause achieve final victory.

In the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, we used the above-mentioned irrefutable facts and theories to expose the conspiracies of those rightists and defeat their attacks on us. At the same time, the broad masses of people have also recognized the major issues of right and wrong on the two roads in terms of national issues and deeply criticized the local nationalism tendencies of some people. Through rectification, the unity and solidarity within socialism has been further consolidated, and the Party's leadership has been further strengthened. Now, on the basis of the victories achieved in the rectification, anti-rightist, and criticism of local nationalism struggles, the people of all ethnic groups in the region are striving to basically build the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base during the second Five-Year Plan and achieve the goal of increasing total grain output by 82.2 percent and increasing the total number of livestock by 47.4 percent.

1958 is the first year of the second Five-Year Plan. We must lay a good foundation for the construction cause of the second Five-Year Plan in the Inner Mongolia region this year. We must further encourage revolutionary vigor, quickly launch a sustained and comprehensive production and construction upsurge, and achieve a Great Leap Forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production.

Strengthen Leadership, Launch Labor Emulation, and Promote the Great Leap Forward in Industry

This year is the year when the Baotou Industrial Base enters its construction peak. The auxiliary factories and factory area projects of Baotou Steel have already started construction. The No. 1 blast furnace will be constructed this year. Coal, electricity, railways, etc. serving Baotou Steel have either been completed or are continuing to be built. The forestry industry will complete the harvesting of 2 million cubic meters of timber and corresponding site renewal. Local industry and other construction undertakings will also have great development this year. Therefore, according to the central government's principle of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development heavy industries," we must first vigorously strengthen the leadership over industry, especially the construction of large industries. While strengthening the leadership of large industries, we must strengthen the leadership of local industries to promote their better service to agricultural and animal husbandry production, to national key construction, and to the production and living needs of urban and rural people. Second, we must launch a comprehensive and sustained upsurge in industrial production and complete various industrial production and construction tasks in a more, better, faster, and more economical manner. Mobilize all employees in the region to deeply carry out socialist labor emulation, resolutely implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and carry out the anti-waste struggle.

Build Water Conservancy, Increase Fertilizer Application, and Promote the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture

In 1958, grain output is required to reach 10.4 billion jin, an increase of 17 percent. The core of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture is to increase yield per unit area. After several years of effort, on the basis of cooperativization, the irrigated area in our region has reached 800,000 hectares, accounting for 14.4 percent of the cultivated land area. In 1956, the average grain output per agricultural population was 1,350 jin. However, Inner Mongolia is located at a high altitude, the climate is cold, the frost-free period is short, and the wind and sand are relatively large. Due to natural disasters in 1957, grain output was greatly reduced. In order to strive to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture, we must vigorously overcome right-leaning conservatism, fully mobilize the masses, and tap production potential. We must first focus on the important measures of building water conservancy and increasing fertilizer application, and reach an irrigated area of 15 million mu in 1958. Now, the farmers in the region have actively taken action, turning winter leisure into winter busy, and marching towards water conservancy construction. They are carrying out the work of leveling land, building embankments, changing flood irrigation to furrow irrigation, digging new wells, and repairing old wells. As of January 28, the statistics show that the region has completed 41.9 percent of the planned projects to increase irrigation area. In order to ensure the healthy development of the water conservancy movement, it is also necessary to implement the principles of overall planning, overall management, and centralized management. Each township, each commune, and each county must have an overall water conservancy construction plan and a phased implementation plan. The planned fertilization area in 1958 should reach 70 percent of the sown area, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu should be actively increased. At present, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the region has reached 59.3 percent of the planned fertilization area, and a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and application movement has been popularized throughout the region. The backward phenomenon of many places where people have no toilets and pigs have no pens has been changed. In order to expand the source of fertilizer, we are also vigorously developing the pig and sheep raising industry, developing some small coal industries, and changing the habit of burning manure and burning grass to increase the source of manure.

Improve Pastures, Establish Feed Bases, and Promote the Great Leap Forward in Animal Husbandry

In 1958, animal husbandry production requires that the total number of livestock reach 24.06 million head, a net increase of 7 percent. From the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957, some banners and leagues in Chahar, Hulunbuir, and Xilingol suffered unprecedented snow disasters in decades. Last year, the vast pastoral areas in the western part of the autonomous region suffered severe droughts, and even the Artemisia sphaerocephala in some areas withered. Up to now, the threat of drought has not been completely eliminated, but we rely on cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and the masses of herdsmen to actively develop water conservancy in pastoral areas, organize relocation of pastures, etc. The pastures in drought-stricken areas have been basically resolved, maintaining the stability of people's lives. In the struggle against disasters, we have received the care and support of relevant departments of the central government and the people of neighboring regions, which has greatly strengthened our disaster relief capabilities in terms of material and spirit.

In order to achieve this year's animal husbandry production targets, we must first insist on deeply carrying out the livestock increasing and protection movement centered on cooperation and mutual assistance, so that livestock can safely overwinter and overspring. We must try every means to preserve the basic breeding stock in disaster areas and strive to improve the breeding and survival rate of livestock. This is the key to increasing production. Second, carry out the four basic construction projects of animal husbandry production: build water conservancy, improve pastures, plan four-season pastures; establish feed bases; carry out animal epidemic prevention and control work; and improve livestock breeds. These are the fundamental measures to change the backward situation in pastoral areas technically. In our work, we must combine national assistance with the self-management of the masses and greatly give play to the strength of cooperatives and mutual aid groups.

Actively and steadily carry out the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. Emphasizing the steady side is correct, but we cannot ignore the active side. This year, it is planned to increase the number of herdsmen households joining cooperatives to 45 to 50 percent.

To achieve a Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry production, we must continue to carry out the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. This is unwavering. Only by transforming the individual animal husbandry economy into a collective economy can we unleash unlimited production potential. The socialist transformation of animal husbandry must be carried out actively and steadily. Under the condition that there is no experience in animal husbandry cooperativization, in order to prevent the use of agricultural cooperativization methods, emphasizing stability is correct, but some people only emphasize the stable side and ignore the active side; some people only see the shortcomings and errors in running cooperatives and deny the superiority of cooperativization, which is a manifestation of right-leaning thinking. The so-called active is to develop a batch, consolidate a batch, and then develop another batch on the basis of doing a good job of full preparation. We plan to increase the existing 24 percent of herdsmen households joining cooperatives by another 20 to 25 percent this year, so that 45 to 50 percent of herdsmen households join cooperatives. Therefore, we must implement the principle of mobilizing the whole Party and letting the secretaries take action, so that all cadres pay attention to animal husbandry and lead cooperativization.

Whether we can achieve a Great Leap Forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in 1958 and whether we can complete the various construction tasks of the autonomous region in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner, in addition to the above-mentioned measures, the key lies in our leadership. In the situation of the leaping forward of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in the autonomous region, strengthening the comprehensive leadership of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production is a reliable guarantee for the smooth completion of the various construction tasks in 1958. Therefore, we must further deepen the rectification movement, thoroughly eliminate the three bad styles, conscientiously implement the working methods of the mass line, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking in leadership, go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, further improve the style of leadership; vigorously criticize local nationalism, further strengthen the unity between the various nationalities, and under the strong leadership of the central government and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the multi-faceted, rapid, good, and economical construction policy, widely mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, inspire revolutionary energy, quickly launch a comprehensive new production upsurge, realize a Great Leap Forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, and strive to complete the various construction tasks in 1958!

    蒙古民族的繁荣离不开汉民族的帮助
    奎璧代表报告内蒙古自治区反对地方民族主义和争取实现工农牧业大跃进的情况
    我完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任向这次会议所作的各项报告。现就内蒙古自治区反对地方民族主义，实现工业、农业、牧业大跃进问题作一汇报。
    各项建设在国家建设总轨道上迅速前进，摆在各族人民面前的是一个日趋繁荣和幸福的自治区。右派分子企图把蒙古民族拖向旧日的老路上去，激起自治区各族人民的极大义愤，并给予坚决回击。
    一九五七年是内蒙古自治区在各个战线上取得伟大胜利的一年。经过整风和反右派斗争，进一步加强了民族团结，巩固了社会主义的政治制度、经济制度。随着我国人民民主革命的胜利，和社会主义改造的决定性胜利，第一个五年计划全面完成和超额完成，自治区的各项建设正在国家社会主义建设总轨道上迅速地前进。摆在各族人民面前的是一个日趋繁荣和幸福的自治区。在内蒙古自治区土地上发生的千百年来没有的变化。真是令人兴奋鼓舞。但是右派分子特别是蒙古民族中的右派分子却利令智昏，在大鸣大放时期，他们披着民族外衣，从民族关系上从党的民族政策上向党向社会主义进行了猖狂的进攻。他们恶毒的说“社会主义在消灭民族”，说“社会主义在制造民族同化”。他们喊着“反对同化”的调子来反对社会主义工业化、反对合作化、反对发展科学文化，排斥汉民族的帮助，进行分离主义活动。提出“蒙汉分治”或“蒙古独立”的主张，企图使蒙古民族脱离祖国大家庭、脱离社会主义道路，把蒙古民族拖向旧日的反动老路上去。与右派分子的愿望相反，他们的这种攻击和复辟阴谋，激起了自治区各族人民的极大义愤，给予了坚决的反击。
    第一个五年计划期间所取得的巨大成就，使内蒙古民族及区内其他民族的政治、经济、文化的面貌都发生了根本变化，这说明蒙古民族离不开汉民族的帮助，离不开社会主义祖国大家庭。
    内蒙古自治区是祖国不可分离的一部分。区内蒙汉人民和其他各族人民长期相处，共同发展了经济和文化。特别是在争取民族解放和各个革命时期的共同斗争中结成了牢不可破的兄弟友谊。这种民族关系在社会主义改造的基础上更有了新的发展和巩固。内蒙古自治区在祖国各兄弟民族特别是汉民族帮助下，随着祖国建设事业的发展，在经济、文化上所取得的成就，就是铁的事实。执行第一个五年计划结果，内蒙古自治区各方面的发展是一个很大的飞跃。粮食产量已达到四百五十五万吨（较一九四七年增长一倍半），牲畜总头数达到二千二百三十八万头，在第一个五年计划内纯增六百六十七万头。工业总产值预计达六亿三千万元，其中地方工业占三亿五千万元。工业在工农业总产值中的比重已由一九五二年的百分之十二上升到一九五七年的百分之三十，一九五七年工业产值相等于一九四六至一九五二年七年的总合。国家在自治区的重点建设——包钢、森林工业、铁路促进了自治区经济、文化的发展，公路交通邮电网已初步形成。文化教育特别是民族教育事业有了迅速发展，从无到有的建立了四所高等院校。所有这些建设成就，使蒙古民族及区内其他民族的政治、经济、文化面貌都发生了根本变化。这些事实，有力地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，粉碎了右派分子对社会主义的污蔑。事实也证明，蒙古民族在政治、经济、文化的发展上都离不开也不应该离开汉民族的帮助，离不开社会主义祖国大家庭这个整体。
    几年来我们安置了为数不少的移民，这对于发展自治区生产建设，已经起了良好的促进作用。今后仍将欢迎、帮助兄弟民族移民到内蒙安家落户。我们反对民族单干，反对民族分裂。因为民族分裂，实质上就是破坏祖国大家庭的团结统一，利于帝国主义和资本主义，不利于民族和社会主义建设，其结果是使旧制度复辟。加强民族团结，共同建设社会主义这是各民族人民的最高利益。也只有国家的统一，国内各兄弟民族的团结，我们的事业才能取得最后的胜利。
    在整风和反右派斗争中，我们用以上这些不可辩驳的事实和理论，揭穿了那些右派分子的阴谋，击溃了右派分子对我们的进攻。同时，也使广大人民认清了在民族问题方面两条道路的大是大非。深入地批判了某些人的地方民族主义的倾向。通过整改，社会主义内部的统一和团结又更加巩固了，党的领导更进一步加强了。现在全区各族人民，正在整风、反右派和批判地方民族主义斗争取得胜利的基础上，为着在第二个五年计划内，基本建成包头钢铁工业基地，实现粮食总产量增长百分之八十二点二，牲畜总头数增长百分之四十七点四的目标而奋斗。
    一九五八年是第二个五年计划的头一年，我们要在这一年为内蒙古地区第二个五年计划建设事业打下良好基础，我们要进一步地鼓舞革命干劲，迅速掀起持久全面的生产建设高潮，在工农牧业生产上来一个大跃进。
    加强领导　开展劳动竞赛
    促进工业大跃进
    今年是包头工业基地进入建设高峰的年代。包钢的附属工厂和厂区工程已经开始建设，第一号高炉要在今年施工，为包钢服务的煤、电、铁路等有的已经建成，有的继续进行建设；森林工业要完成二百万立方米的木材采伐和相应的迹地更新，地方工业和其他建设事业今年也有很大发展。因此，根据中央提出的“在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业与发展农业同时并举”的方针下，我们要首先大力加强对工业首先是大工业建设的领导。在加强大工业领导的同时加强对地方工业的领导，促进其更好地为农业和牧业生产，为国家重点建设，为城乡人民生产生活需要服务。其次掀起全面持久的工业生产高潮。要又多又好又快又省地完成工业生产和工业建设的各项任务。发动全区职工深入开展社会主义劳动竞赛，坚决贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针，开展反浪费斗争。
    兴修水利　增施肥料
    促进农业大跃进
    一九五八年要求粮食产量达到一百零四亿斤，增产百分之十七。农业大跃进的中心是提高单位面积产量。经过几年的努力，我区在合作化的基础上，灌溉面积已达八十万公顷，占耕地面积百分之十四点四，在一九五六年粮食产量平均农业人口每人一千三百五十斤。但内蒙地处原高，气候寒冷，无霜期短，风沙较大，一九五七年由于自然灾害，粮食产量曾大大减产。为了争取实现农业的大丰收，必须大力克服右倾保守，充分发动群众，发掘生产潜力，我们要首先抓住兴修水利和增施肥料的重要措施，在一九五八年达到灌溉面积一千五百万亩，现在全区农民已积极行动起来，变冬闲为冬忙，向水利建设进军。进行平地、打堰、改漫溉为畦灌、打新井、修旧井的工作，截至一月二十八日的统计，全区增灌面积计划，已完成工程计划的百分之四十一点九。为使水利运动健康的发展，还必须贯彻全面规划、全面治理、集中治理的方针，每乡、每社、每县都要有全面的水利建设规划和分期分批实施计划。一九五八年计划施肥面积要达到播种面积的百分之七十，并积极增加每亩施肥数量。目前全区积肥数量已达到施肥面积计划百分之五十九点三，一个声势浩大的积肥施肥运动已经普及全区。许多地方人无厕所、猪无圈棚的落后现象已经改变，为了扩大肥源，还正大力发展养猪养羊业，开发一些小煤业，改变烧粪烧草的习惯，以增加粪源。
    改良牧场　建立饲料基地
    促进牧业大跃进
    一九五八年牧业生产要求将牲畜总头数达到二千四百零六万头，牲畜纯增百分之七。一九五六年冬到一九五七年春，察哈尔，呼伦贝尔及锡林郭勒盟部分旗遭受了数十年来未有的雪灾。去年，自治区西部的广大牧区遭受了严重的旱灾，部分地区连沙蒿都枯死了。到现在旱灾的威胁还未完全消除，但是我们依靠合作社互助组和牧民群众，积极开展了牧区水利，组织移场等，旱灾区牧场基本得到解决，保持了人民生活的安定。我们在抗灾斗争中取得了中央有关部门和友邻地区人民的关怀和支持，在物质上精神上大大加强了抗灾力量。
    为了实现今年的牧业生产指标，首先坚持深入地开展以合作互助为中心的增畜保畜运动，使牲畜安全过冬过春。想尽一切办法保存灾区的基础母畜，努力提高牲畜的增殖成活率。这是增产的关键所在。其次进行牧业生产的四项基本建设。兴修水利，改良牧场，规划四季牧场；建立饲料基地；开展兽疫防治工作；改良牲畜品种等。这些都是从技术上改变牧区落后状况的根本措施。在工作中必须使国家帮助和群众自办相结合，把合作社互助组的力量大大发挥起来。
    积极稳步地进行对牧业的社会主义改造。强调稳进一面是对的，但不能忽视积极的一面。今年计划使入社牧户达到百分之四十五到五十。
    要牧业生产大跃进，必须继续进行对牧业的社会主义改造。这是坚定不移的。只有把个体的牧业经济变为集体经济，才能无限发挥生产潜力。牧业社会主义改造必须是积极稳步的进行。在牧业合作化全无经验的条件下，为防止搬用农业合作化作法，强调稳进是对的，但有些人只强调稳进的一面，忽视了积极的一面；有的人只看到办社中的缺点错误而否认合作化的优越性，这是一种右倾思想表现。所谓积极，就是在做好充分准备工作的基础上，发展一批，巩固一批，再发展一批。我们计划在今年现有入社牧户百分之二十四的基础上，再发展百分之二十至二十五，使入社牧户达到百分之四十五至五十，因此必须贯彻全党动员、书记动手的原则，使所有干部都来注意畜牧业和领导合作化。
    一九五八年能否实现工农牧业生产大跃进，能否又多、又快、又好、又省的完成自治区的各项建设任务，除了以上所提的各项措施而外，关键在于我们的领导。处在自治区工农牧业生产跃进的形势下，加强对工农牧业生产的全面领导，是顺利完成一九五八年各项建设任务的可靠保证，因此，必须进一步深入地开展整风运动，彻底打掉三个坏主义，认真贯彻群众路线的工作方法，克服领导上的右倾保守思想，深入实际，深入群众，进一步改进领导作风；大力批判地方民族主义，进一步加强各民族间的团结，在中央和毛主席的坚强领导下，在多、快、好、省和勤俭建设方针的指导下，广泛发动自治区各族人民，鼓起革命干劲，迅速掀起一个全面的新的生产高潮，实现工农牧业生产大跃进，为胜利完成一九五八年的各项建设任务而努力！
