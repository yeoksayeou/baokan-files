Spring Couplets Selection

    Going down to the countryside and up to the mountains to rush towards the labor front
    Tempered and refined to become a versatile talent in both arts and military skills

    Increasing production is better than a money tree
    Practicing thrift is like a treasure bowl
    (Wang Juenan)

    春联选
    下乡上山奔向劳动战线
    千锤百炼养成文武全才
    增产胜过摇钱树
    节约如同聚宝盆
    （王珏南）
