　　It is an Economic Battle, But Also a Battle of Ideology
    Chen Kehan Introduces the Ministry of Culture's Anti-Waste Situation and Experience at the Meeting of the Party Committee of State Organs

　　Chen Kehan, Vice Minister of Culture, introduced the progress and experience of the Ministry of Culture's anti-waste campaign at the 20th plenary meeting of the Party Committee of Central State Organs on the morning of February 5th. After more than ten days of mass airing of views and free airing of ideas in the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated units, a large number of wasteful phenomena and serious bourgeois business ideas were exposed. This campaign has once again given all employees a vivid socialist education.

    Chen Kehan first pointed out that launching an anti-waste campaign in cultural departments is not only an economic battle, but also an ideological battle. Through this campaign, we must not only burn away all wasteful phenomena and implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, but also mobilize the masses to start with exposing specific problems of waste, conduct in-depth inspections of leadership thinking and style, overcome the three bad tendencies, oppose bourgeois business ideas, and eliminate extravagance, bureaucratism, lethargy, arrogance, and delicacy, in order to earnestly implement the Party's policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and serving socialism.

    Horrifying Waste of Manpower
    A Famous Actor Works for One Minute and Twenty-One Seconds a Year

    Chen Kehan said that the characteristics of the Ministry of Culture's anti-waste campaign are strong momentum, rapid development, and fast progress. From January 24th, when Vice Minister Qian Junrui made a mobilization report, to the present, most of the 53 affiliated institutions and enterprises of the Ministry of Culture have launched a mass anti-waste upsurge. The signs of this are: more than 90% of the masses in these units have been mobilized, a large number of major wastes have been exposed, and they dare to criticize by name the leaders of their own units or higher authorities. Among the 9,783 people participating in the campaign in these 53 units, more than 33,500 opinions have been put forward through big-character posters and other forms, exposing many horrifying wasteful phenomena. The waste that has been exposed is mainly manifested in the use of manpower, which is most serious in artistic performing units. For example, some famous actors in the China Peking Opera Theater only performed 16 shows last year, and an actor in the Central Experimental Opera Theater only broadcasted for one minute and twenty-one seconds on the radio station last year. Twenty people in the Central National Song and Dance Troupe have not worked at all or have worked very little in the past three years. It is estimated that the employees of the departments directly under the Ministry of Culture in Beijing (excluding schools) can continue to be streamlined and delegated by about 15% on the basis of the current decentralization. The waste in the cultural system is also manifested in materials and equipment. The accumulation and waste of costumes in artistic performance departments is very serious. In addition to the costumes used for daily performances, the Experimental Opera Theater has more than 5,000 pieces accumulated in the warehouse. The Beijing Library buys too many copies of books, such as "Zizhi Tongjian," which was bought 140 copies, forming a large backlog. The People's Pictorial has only 17 photojournalists, but it owns 106 cameras, an average of about 7 cameras per reporter. In addition, waste in capital construction and foreign affairs is also very prominent. For example, the Beijing Film Printing Factory was constructed during the first five-year plan, with an investment of 17 million yuan. It is estimated that by the end of the second five-year plan, the productivity will only be used to 50%. The newly built Fine Arts Printing Factory is also designed too large and the standards are too high. Chen Kehan pointed out that based on the waste that has been exposed, it is estimated that the budget of the central units directly under the Ministry of Culture can be saved by about 15% this year.

    Lax Management System - Giving Money With Eyes Closed
    Chen Kehan pointed out that what is more important is that through anti-waste, the extremely serious bourgeois ideology and bureaucratic style existing in the cultural departments have been exposed. At present, the atmosphere of extravagance and ostentation is very common in artistic performance units, forming a bad style of comparing costumes and scenery instead of performances, which affects the inability to better implement the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers. The Central Experimental Opera Theater only puts on big plays for intellectuals, and the costumes and props for a play often cost more than 10,000 yuan. Due to the excessive pursuit of luxurious scenery, only the costumes and props for performances in other places require two or three train cars, which not only makes it impossible to go to factories and the countryside, but even small and medium-sized cities cannot go. The film and publishing departments have capitalist management ideas, and the management system is chaotic. Due to the great blindness in publishing and distribution work, the Xinhua Bookstore's inventory in 1957 reached more than 200 million yuan, and the ratio of inventory to sales was 72.7%. Many publishing houses also use the method of paying advances to authors to win over writers. Personalistic thoughts have grown somewhat among many creative, performance, and editing personnel. Many people attempt to "become famous in one fell swoop," only caring about personal fame and gain, and disregarding national interests. A director at the Beijing Film Studio has taken more than 30,000 yuan in wages for seven or eight years, but in order to become famous, he often excuses that the script is not good and has not made a film. Many editors are not enthusiastic about their own work, but rush to engage in amateur translation work, and many earn royalties. In many departments, departmentalism is also very serious. Chen Kehan said that this anti-waste campaign has also concentratedly exposed the weak political and ideological leadership of the Ministry of Culture, the lack of effective measures in implementing the Party's cultural work policy; the lax management system, "giving money with eyes closed"; the leaders do not go deep into the lower levels on weekdays, do not check their work, handle affairs subjectively, and are divorced from reality.

    Chen Kehan then talked about the experience of the Ministry of Culture in carrying out the anti-waste campaign. The experience of the Ministry of Culture proves that the key to ensuring the rapid and healthy development of the campaign lies in leadership. The leaders must have great determination, sufficient energy, and quick action, led by the top leader, and resolutely overcome the complacency of thinking that "there is not much waste in this unit, it is a 'clean yamen'" or "the anti-waste campaign is almost over," and mobilize the masses boldly without any scruples, not afraid of digging to the bottom, and personally take the lead in airing of views and free airing of ideas, igniting the fire to burn upwards. Wherever this is done, the campaign develops quickly and well. In terms of the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, it is mainly to fully explain the political significance of the anti-waste campaign and the relationship between anti-waste and business to the leading cadres and the masses of the affiliated units, to encourage revolutionary vigor, to dispel the concerns of some leading cadres about being held accountable, to explain that some wasteful phenomena are due to insufficient leadership experience, and also that many wasteful phenomena are mainly due to the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership of the Ministry of Culture. As long as the leading cadres can boldly mobilize the masses, stand in front of the campaign, discover errors and shortcomings, and earnestly examine and correct them, they will generally not be held accountable.

    Grasp Typical Cases to Promote General Cases; Summarize Experience to Guide the Campaign
    Chen Kehan said that resolutely following the mass line, and promptly popularizing the experience created by the masses, and opposing the right-leaning conservative thinking of passive fatigue and closed-door rectification have important significance for the development of the campaign. The anti-waste campaign can generally be divided into three steps: airing of views, debate, and rectification, which are interconnected and cross each other. At the beginning, the leadership should mobilize the masses to thoroughly expose the facts of waste, and should not rush to verify the facts and argue about right and wrong. Leading cadres should be good at dispelling the concerns of the masses, especially middle-level cadres, call on Party members and League members to take the lead in airing of views and free airing of ideas, and give play to the active forces of young employees. Some units of the Ministry of Culture have formed youth commando teams under the leadership of the Party. They are closely linked to the masses and have played an advanced role in the anti-waste campaign. In addition, the campaign can also be promoted in depth by organizing special inspection teams, holding exhibitions, and organizing evaluations and competitions. The inspection team must have representatives of the masses participate, be closely combined with the masses, and the inspection results should be announced at any time to promote in-depth airing of views. Exhibitions should also be small and simple, directly cooperate with the campaign, and need not pay too much attention to form.

    Chen Kehan said that the leaders must be good at grasping the laws of the campaign, guiding the masses to mainly point the finger at waste, bourgeois ideology, and bureaucratic work style, and must not make mistakes in the direction. There will inevitably be debates in the exposure of waste, and debates should be carried out on the basis of exposing the facts of waste, and prevent the debates from being led to abstract discussions of ideological issues. Chen Kehan said that according to the experience of the Ministry of Culture, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to widely air their views, and oppose all wastes, no matter how big or small; the leading cadres must also have a clear idea in their minds, grasp the key points, and guide the masses to gradually expose the waste with large amounts or serious nature. Leading cadres must often go deep into the grassroots units, grasp typical cases to promote general cases; on the other hand, they must not ignore the serious study of problems and systematically summarize experience to guide the campaign.

    Chen Kehan finally said that most of the units under the Ministry of Culture are about to move into special debates on anti-waste. In the stage of great debate, the leaders should still be determined to ignite the fire on themselves and ignite the fire upwards, boldly mobilize the masses, dare to express different opinions, and enlighten the masses to mainly examine the problems in the aspects of leadership ideology and work style. Through debate, we must formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy, personnel establishment plans, and other plans for improving work.

　　是一场经济仗　也是一场思想仗
    陈克寒在国家机关党委会议上介绍文化部反浪费情况和经验
    新华社6日讯　文化部副部长陈克寒5日上午在中央国家机关党委第二十次全体会议上介绍了文化部反浪费运动的进展情况和经验。文化部及所属单位经过十多天来群众性的大鸣大放，揭露出大量的浪费现象和严重的资产阶级业务思想。这次运动使全体职工再一次受到了生动的社会主义教育。
    陈克寒首先指出，在文化部门展开反浪费运动，不仅是一场经济仗，而且是一场思想仗。通过这次运动不仅要烧掉一切浪费现象，贯彻勤俭建国方针，而且要发动群众，从揭发浪费的具体问题入手，深入检查领导思想和作风，克服三个坏主义，反对资产阶级的业务思想，打掉阔气、官气、暮气、骄气和娇气，以认真执行党的文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方针。
    骇人听闻的人力浪费
    一个名演员一年工作一分二十一秒
    陈克寒说，劲头大、来势猛、发展快是文化部这次反浪费运动的特点。从1月24日钱俊瑞副部长作动员报告到目前为止，文化部所属五十三个事业、企业单位中绝大部分已掀起了群众性反浪费高潮，它的标志是：这些单位的90％以上的群众已经发动起来，对于大宗浪费有了大量的揭露，并且敢于指名批评本单位或上级领导人。这五十三个单位参加运动的九千七百八十三人中，通过大字报等形式，已经提出意见三万三千五百多条，揭露出许多骇人听闻的浪费现象。已经揭露出的浪费，首先表现在人力使用方面，这以艺术事业单位最为严重，如中国京剧院有的著名演员去年只演了十六场，中央实验歌剧院有一名演员去年只是在广播电台广播过一分二十一秒钟，中央民族歌舞团有二十人三年来完全没有工作或很少工作。据估计，文化部在北京的直属部门的职工（学校除外），在目前下放的基础上，还可以继续紧缩和下放15％左右。文化系统的浪费也表现在物资设备方面，艺术表演部门服装积压和浪费十分严重，实验歌剧院除日常演出所用的服装外，在仓库中还积压了五千多件。北京图书馆购书时复本太多，如“资治通鉴”就买了一百四十部，形成大量积压。人民画报社只有十七名摄影记者，却拥有照像机一百零六架，平均每个记者七架左右。此外，在基本建设、外事往来方面的浪费也很突出。如北京电影洗印厂在第一个五年计划期间施工，投资一千七百万元，估计到第二个五年计划期末，生产力只能用到50％。新建的美术印刷厂也设计太大，标准太高。陈克寒指出，从已经揭露出来的浪费情况看，今年文化部中央各直属单位的经费预算，估计可以节省15％左右。
    管理制度不严　闭着眼睛给钱
    陈克寒指出，更重要的是通过反浪费，揭露出文化部门中存在的极其严重的资产阶级思想和官僚主义作风。目前在艺术表演单位中，讲阔气、摆排场的风气很普遍，形成不比表演而比服装布景的坏作风，影响到不能很好地贯彻执行文艺为工农兵服务的方针。中央实验歌剧院尽排一些给知识分子看的大戏，排一个戏，服装、道具往往要花一万元以上。由于过度地追求豪华布景，到外地演出仅运服装道具就要两三个车皮，不仅无法下厂下乡，连中小城市也不能去。电影、出版部门都有资本主义经营思想，经营管理制度混乱。由于出版发行工作中盲目性很大，新华书店1957年库存达到两亿元以上，存货占销货的比例是72.7％。许多出版社还用预付稿费的办法来拢络作家。许多创作、表演、编辑等业务人员中，个人主义思想有所滋长，不少人企图“一举成名”，只顾个人名利，不顾国家利益。北京电影制片厂有一个导演七八年来拿了三万多元工薪，但为了个人出名，常借口剧本不好，而没有拍一部影片。不少编辑人员不热心于份内的工作，却争先搞业余翻译工作，好多拿稿费。在许多部门里，本位主义也很严重。陈克寒说，通过这次反浪费也集中地暴露了文化部政治思想领导薄弱，在贯彻执行党的文化工作方针上缺乏有效的措施；管理制度不严，“闭着眼睛给钱”；领导人平时不深入下层，不检查工作，主观办事，脱离实际。
    陈克寒接着谈到了文化部开展反浪费运动的经验。文化部的经验证明，保证运动迅速健康发展的关键在于领导。领导人要决心大、劲头足、行动快，由第一把手挂帅，坚决克服那种认为“本单位是‘清水衙门’没什么浪费”或“已经反得差不多了”等自满情绪，毫无顾虑，不怕挖底，大胆放手地发动群众，并且亲自带头鸣放，引火上烧。凡是这样做的地方，运动就发展得又快又好。在文化部的领导方面，主要是向所属单位领导干部和群众充分说明反浪费运动的政治意义以及反浪费同业务的关系，鼓舞革命干劲，解除有些领导干部怕追究责任等顾虑，说明有些浪费现象的产生是由于领导上经验不足，也有许多浪费现象的产生主要是由于文化部领导上的官僚主义和主观主义，各级领导干部只要能够放手发动群众，站在运动前面，发现错误缺点，认真检查改正，一般地不追究责任。
    抓住典型　推动一般  总结经验　指导运动
    陈克寒说，坚决走群众路线，及时推广群众所创造的经验，反对消极疲沓、关门整改的右倾保守思想，对于运动开展具有重要意义。反浪费运动一般地可以分为鸣放、辩论、整改三个步骤，它们又互相衔接、互相交叉。领导上开始时应当发动群众彻底揭露浪费事实，不要急于核对事实，争辩是非。领导干部应善于解除群众特别是中层干部的顾虑，号召党团员带头鸣放，发挥青年职工的积极力量。文化部有些单位在党的领导下组成青年突击队，他们密切联系群众，在反浪费运动中起了先进的作用。此外，还可以通过组织专门检查组、举行展览会、组织评比和竞赛等办法来推动运动深入发展。检查组必须有群众代表参加，同群众密切结合，检查结果随时公布，以推动深入鸣放。展览会也要力求小型简便，直接配合运动，不必太讲形式。
    陈克寒说，领导人要善于掌握运动的规律，引导群众把矛头主要指向浪费、资产阶级思想和官僚主义作风，不要弄错了方向。揭露浪费中必然会有辩论，辩论要在揭露浪费事实的基础上进行，防止把辩论引向抽象地谈论思想问题。陈克寒说，根据文化部的经验，既要发动群众广泛鸣放，不管大小浪费都要反对；领导干部也要心中有数，掌握重点，引导群众逐步揭露数目大或性质严重的浪费。领导干部要经常深入基层单位，抓住典型，推动一般；另一方面也不能忽视认真地研究问题，系统地总结经验，以指导运动。
    陈克寒最后说，文化部所属单位中大部分即将转入反浪费的专题辩论。在大辩论阶段，领导人仍应下定决心引火烧身和引火上烧，放手发动群众，敢于发表不同意见，并且启发群众主要检查领导思想作风方面的问题。要通过辩论，订出增产节约方案和人员编制方案，以及其他改进工作的方案。
