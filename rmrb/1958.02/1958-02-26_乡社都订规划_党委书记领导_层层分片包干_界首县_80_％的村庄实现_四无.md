    In Jieshou County, 80% of Villages Achieve "Four-No's"

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: As of the eve of the old Lunar New Year, Jieshou County in Anhui Province, after inspection, has already produced over nine hundred "Four-No Villages" and "Four-No Streets," accounting for 80% of the county's villages and streets. On the day before the Lunar New Year's Eve, the entire county launched a concentrated day of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, with 78% of the county's population participating in the hygiene campaign. Currently, the people of Jieshou County are carrying out a final extermination of the remaining "four pests," striving to achieve a "Four-No County" in the first half of this year.

    Jieshou County is the most advanced county in Anhui Province in the Four Pests Elimination campaign. In the month from January 14th to February 14th, an average of 270,000 people throughout the county, in conjunction with production, participated in the Four Pests Elimination campaign every day, accounting for more than 77% of the county's total population. A total of more than 480,000 sparrows have been caught, and more than 1,170,000 rats have been exterminated, an average of 22 sparrows and rats caught per household. At the same time, 52,543 nests of flies were exterminated, 12,132 nests of mosquitoes and sandflies were exterminated, more than 180,000 sparrow nests were destroyed, and more than 940,000 rat holes were blocked. In addition, all walls were plastered with mud, ditches were cleaned, and the interior and exterior were swept, clearing a total of more than 2.73 million dan of garbage.

    Jieshou County's Four Pests Elimination campaign achieved amazing results in a short period of time, first and foremost because it truly achieved "the whole Party taking action and the Secretary being responsible." After the county's Party Congress discussed and formulated a plan to eliminate the four pests in six months, the Party organizations of each township and commune extensively mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate specific plans for each township and commune. Next, a command headquarters was established at all levels, with the Party Committee Secretary personally serving as the commander. At the same time, the method of layer-by-layer division of responsibility was adopted, with county committee members responsible for townships, township cadres responsible for communes, commune cadres responsible for teams, team cadres responsible for sections, Party and League members responsible for households, and organizations responsible for their locations, establishing a strict responsibility system for the elimination of the four pests. While directing operations, leaders at all levels also personally participated in activities such as catching sparrows and exterminating rats. In this way, the Four Pests Elimination campaign quickly became a nationwide movement.

    Jieshou County also universally adopted leadership methods of organizing debates, calculating accounts and comparisons, and "grasping the advanced, learning from the advanced, and comparing with the advanced." The county organized more than 200 agricultural cooperative directors and representatives attending the Party Congress to visit and study Yang Xiaozhai, which had already achieved "Four-No's." In addition, each township and commune organized more than 100 observation and evaluation meetings in 65 key villages for the elimination of the four pests, setting off a wave of mutual competition.

    乡社都订规划　党委书记领导　层层分片包干
    界首县80％的村庄实现“四无”
    新华社讯　安徽省界首县到旧历除夕为止，经过检查，已出现九百多个“四无村”和“四无街道”，占全县村庄和街道的80％。除夕前一天，全县开展了一个除四害、讲卫生突击日，占这个县78％的人口投入了卫生运动。目前，界首县人民正对残余“四害”进行歼灭，争取在今年上半年实现“四无县”。
    界首县是安徽省除四害运动中最先进的县，这个县从1月14日到2月14日的一个月中，全县每天平均有二十七万人结合生产投入除四害运动，占全县总人口的77％强。共计已捕雀四十八万多只，灭鼠一百一十七万多只，平均每户捕鼠雀达二十二只。同时还灭蝇五万二千五百四十三合，灭蚊和白蛉子一万二千一百三十二合，捣毁雀窝十八万多个，堵鼠洞九十四万多个。另外还泥刷了所有墙壁，清理了阴沟，并打扫了室内外，共计清除垃圾二百七十三万多担。
    界首县除四害运动在短期内就取得了惊人的成绩，首先是因为真正做到了“全党动手、书记负责”。这个县在党代表大会上讨论制订出半年消灭四害的规划以后，各乡、社党的组织就广泛发动群众讨论，订出了一乡一社的具体规划。接着就建立各级作战指挥部，党委书记亲自担任指挥。同时又采取层层分片包干的办法，县委委员包乡、乡干部包社、社干部包队、队干部包片、党团员包户、机关包所在地，建立了严格的除四害责任制。在指挥作战的同时，各级负责人并亲自参加捕雀、灭鼠等活动。这样，除四害运动很快就变成了全民性的运动。
    界首县还普遍采用组织辩论、算账对比和“抓先进、学先进、比先进”的领导方法，全县除组织二百多个农业社主任和参加党代表大会的代表，到早已实现“四无”的杨小寨参观学习外，各乡、社也在六十五个除四害重点村组织了一百多次的观摩评比，掀起了相互竞赛的热潮。
