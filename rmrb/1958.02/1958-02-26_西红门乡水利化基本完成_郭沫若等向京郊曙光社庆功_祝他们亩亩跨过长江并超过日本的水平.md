Xihongmen Township Basically Completes Water Conservancy
Guo Moruo and Others Congratulate the Shuguang Cooperative in the Suburbs of Beijing
Wishing Them Grain Yields Per Mu to Cross the Yangtze River and Exceed the Level of Japan

    Glimmer of dawn first appeared in 1954,
    Crossing the Yangtze River in 1958,
    From now on, it will be a sun that never sets,
    Transforming Xihongmen Township into paradise.

This is the congratulatory poem that Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, wrote on the spot yesterday during a visit to the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xihongmen Township, Beijing's suburbs. Because this cooperative has mustered its energy and, in less than four months, excavated 130,000 cubic meters of earth and completed seven reservoirs, it has achieved water conservancy on 91.6% of the township's land. This year, it is guaranteed to produce 800 jin of grain per mu, and strives to reach 1,000 jin per mu. A month and a half ago, they were working intensely on construction. The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized people from literary and art circles to visit and have a get-together, and participated in some earth-carrying labor. Now, the water conservancy of the whole township has been basically completed, and a celebration meeting was held yesterday. The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles again organized people from literary and art circles, headed by Guo Moruo, to visit the cooperative and participate in their celebration meeting. Guo Moruo warmly congratulated the members at this celebration meeting. He said: "The members of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative have demonstrated the heroic spirit of socialism and won a great victory on the land of Xihongmen Township. I wish you all 16,000 mu of land per mu to cross the Yangtze River, and I wish you to exceed the level of Japan, and after several five-year plans, to reach 3,000 jin per mu." He also said: "Our scientific community must support you, and science must also make a great leap forward to support you with chemical fertilizers." At the celebration meeting, Yu Zhenfei, Yan Huizhu, Li Yuru and other famous actors of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, who are currently performing in Beijing, performed operas such as "Yu Tang Chun", "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and "San Cha Kou" for everyone, which were warmly welcomed by the peasants.

Yesterday, along with Guo Moruo, Tian Han, Yang Hansheng, Ouyang Yuqian, Xu Guangping, Zhao Shuli, Zhou Libo, Ai Wu, Xie Bingxin, Feng Zhi, Liu Kaiqu, Cao Jinghua and more than 100 people from literary and art circles visited the cooperative and participated in the celebration meeting.

    西红门乡水利化基本完成
    郭沫若等向京郊曙光社庆功
    祝他们亩亩跨过长江并超过日本的水平
    一九五四年初现曙光，
    一九五八年跨过长江，
    今后是永不下山的太阳，
    把西红门乡建成天堂。
    这是中国文联主席郭沫若昨天参观访问京郊西红门乡曙光农业生产合作社时即席写给这个社的祝词。由于这个社鼓足了干劲，不到四个月工夫，挖了十三万土方，完成了七个水柜，使全乡91.6％的土地实现了水利化。今年保证亩产粮食八百斤，争取达到千斤社。一个半月前，他们正在紧张施工中，中国文联曾组织文艺界前往访问联欢，并参加了一些运土劳动。现在全乡水利化已基本完成，昨天举行庆功大会。中国文联又组织了以郭沫若为首的文艺界人士再次访问这个社，并参加他们的庆功大会。郭沫若在这个庆功大会上向社员们热烈祝贺。他说：“曙光农业社的社员们表示了社会主义的英雄气概，向西红门乡的土地打了一个大胜仗。祝你们全社的一万六千亩土地亩亩跨过长江，并且祝你们超过日本的水平，几个五年计划之后，达到每亩三千斤。”他还说：“我们科学界一定要支援你们，科学也要来一个大跃进，支援你们化学肥料。”在庆功大会上，正在京演出的上海京剧院著名演员俞振飞、言慧珠、李玉茹等为大家演出了玉堂春、拾玉镯、三岔口等戏，受到了农民的热烈欢迎。
    昨天和郭沫若一同在这个社访问及参加庆功会的还有，文联的全国委员田汉、阳翰笙、欧阳予倩、许广平、赵树理、周立波、艾芜、谢冰心、冯至、刘开渠、曹靖华及文艺界共一百多人。
