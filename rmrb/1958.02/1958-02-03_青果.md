　　Green olives are already on the market. The lush, green olives, stored in glass jars, emit an alluring luster.

　　The green olive is actually called the olive. Because it has a characteristic of remaining green from the time it bears fruit until it ripens, it is usually called the green olive. The green olive also has another name, the "admonishing fruit," which comes from its flavor. When the green olive is first chewed in the mouth, it tastes astringent and slightly bitter, but after chewing for a while, it becomes somewhat sweet. The ancients compared this characteristic of being first astringent and then sweet to the honest and frank advice of ancient officials who remonstrated with feudal emperors, hence the name "admonishing fruit." However, this name is rarely used by the public except in writing.

　　The green olive tree is a tall tree. China is its place of origin, and it is most commonly planted in the warm climate provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Its leaves are oblong-lanceolate, one and a half to three and a half inches long and one to one and two-tenths of an inch wide. It blooms in the second month of the lunar calendar and the fruit ripens in August. It is shaped much like the northern jujube, seven or eight fen long, green in color, with a hard pit, sharp at both ends, with a wrinkled skin and faintly visible six raised ridges; the pit is divided into three chambers, each containing a kernel.

　　The Chinese people have a widespread habit of eating green olives. It is generally believed that it has the effect of promoting salivation, quenching thirst, and aiding digestion. Li Shizhen also said in the Compendium of Materia Medica that it can "stimulate the appetite, lower qi, stop diarrhea, promote salivation, stop thirst, treat sore throats, and chewing and swallowing the juice can detoxify all kinds of fish toxins."

　　According to modern nutritionists, green olives are very rich in vitamin C. According to Shen Tong, Yunnan-produced green olives contain 9 milligrams of vitamin C per milliliter of fruit; Wan Xin analyzed Guizhou-produced olives and found 3.95 milligrams per gram; Luo Dengyi measured 4 milligrams per gram of pulp. This amount is much higher than most vegetables. Therefore, eating some green olives not only has the effect of promoting salivation, quenching thirst, and aiding digestion, but also increases the supply of vitamin C.

　　In addition to being eaten fresh, green olives can also be made into various processed products with different flavors. There are many processing methods, and there are no less than a dozen common ones on the market, but the main ones are pickled with salt and sugar. The bitterness and astringency of the processed products are completely eliminated, making them more palatable, but unfortunately most of the vitamin C is lost.

　　Mediterranean countries in Europe, such as Italy and Greece, have a kind of Alebu tree, also called the olive tree, which is actually different from the Chinese olive tree. In botany, the Alebu tree and the olive tree belong to two different families. Although its pulp can also be eaten, its fruit is mainly used to extract oil, which is of much higher economic value than the pulp. The extracted oil can be used for cooking, lighting, and making soap, and it is also often used as a lubricant in medicine.

　　Painters often use doves holding olive branches in their mouths to symbolize peace. This allusion originally came from the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament. According to the original text, the branch held by the dove should be an Alebu tree branch. The Chinese text of Genesis translates it as an olive tree branch, so everyone has always called the Alebu tree branch in the mouth of the dove of peace an olive tree branch.

    青果早已上市了。装在玻璃罐里的一颗颗湛青碧绿的青果，发出诱人的光泽来。
    青果本名叫做橄榄。因为它有个特点，从结果到成熟，始终保持青色，所以通常都把它叫作青果。青果还有个别名叫谏果，这是由于它的味道的特点而来的。青果放在嘴里初咀嚼时，味道涩而又有些苦，等嚼过一会之后，又会觉得有些甜丝丝的。古人把它这种先涩后甜的特点，比作古代谏官规劝封建帝王的逆耳忠言，所以又有谏果之称。但这个名称除了见之于文字之外，群众很少这样叫的。
    青果树是一种乔木。我国是它的原产地，福建、广东等气候温暖的省分栽植最多。它的叶子是长椭圆状披针形，长一寸半至三寸半，阔一寸至一寸二分。每年阴历2月开花，8月果实成熟，形状很像北方的戛戛枣，长七、八分，颜色青绿，果核坚硬，两端尖锐，皮面多皱，隐约可以看出有六条隆起的棱；核内分为三室，每室都有一颗果仁。
    我国人民吃青果的习惯很普遍。一般都认为它有生津、止渴和助消化的作用。李时珍在本草纲目上也说它能“开胃下气，止泻，生津液，止烦渴，治咽喉痛，咀嚼咽汁，能解一切鱼龞毒。”
    根据近代营养学者的研究，青果所含的维生素丙很丰富。据沈同氏报告云南产的青果每毫升果中含有维生素丙9毫克；万昕氏分析贵州产的，每克中含有3.95毫克；罗登义氏测定每克果肉中含有4毫克。这个数量比较一般蔬菜要高得多。所以吃些青果，不但有生津止渴、助消化的效果，还可以增加维生素丙的供给。
    青果除了鲜吃以外，还可以制成各种风味不同的加工品。加工方法很多，市上常见的就不下十几种，但主要的不外是用盐糖腌渍。经过加工的制品，苦涩之味全消，吃起来更觉适口，可惜的是其中维生素丙大部都已损失了。
    欧洲地中海沿岸国家，如意大利、希腊等国有一种阿列布树，也被称为橄榄树，实际和我国橄榄树并不相同。在植物学上，阿列布树同橄榄树是分两科的。它的果肉虽然也可以供食用，但主要是用它的果实榨油，经济价值比果肉高得多。榨出的油可以食用、燃灯和做肥皂，在医药上也常利用它作滑润药。
    画家们常用口里衔着橄榄枝的鸽子，来象征和平。这个典故本来出于旧约创世记，依照原文，鸽子口里含的应当是阿列布树枝，创世记中文本上译为橄榄树枝，所以大家一直都把和平鸽口中的阿列布树枝叫作橄榄树枝了。
