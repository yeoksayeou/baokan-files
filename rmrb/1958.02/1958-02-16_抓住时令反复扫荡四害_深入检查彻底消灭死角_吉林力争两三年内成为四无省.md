Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 14th: The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a provincial telephone conference, proposing that, with the exception of remote and sparsely populated areas, efforts should be made to basically eliminate the "Four Pests" within two to three years, eradicate the most serious diseases endangering the people, and transform Jilin Province into a "Four-Without" Province. The people of the province are currently seizing the key season for eliminating the "Four Pests," boosting revolutionary enthusiasm, and conducting focused blitz campaigns and repeated sweeps. Around the Spring Festival, the province-wide Four Pests eradication campaign will enter a new upsurge.

In the previous period, the province seized the opportunity of the cold weather, when rats and sparrows were in a situation of no food in the wild and their activity range was reduced, to launch a large-scale rat and sparrow catching campaign. According to the statistics of thirty-eight cities and counties alone, from mid-January to February 5th, more than 727,100 rats and more than 1,637,300 sparrows have been caught, resulting in one rat-free town, 108 rat-free villages, three rat-free streets, and ninety-one rat-free neighborhood committees. At the same time, the people of the province, in conjunction with the rural manure accumulation campaign, launched a concentrated effort to clear snow, garbage, and feces to prevent garbage and dirt from blocking drainage facilities and breeding mosquitoes and flies after the snow melts in the spring. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the telephone conference, requested that all localities launch a war of annihilation against the "Four Pests" (based on the specific situation in Jilin Province, the focus is currently on eliminating rats, sparrows, lice, and cockroaches) before the Spring Festival, and rapidly push the winter patriotic health campaign to a new upsurge. In recent days, the people of the province are unfolding a mass patriotic health campaign in accordance with the traditional health habits of sweeping dust before the Spring Festival.

In order to eliminate blind spots and blank spots in the Four Pests eradication campaign, the province has organized powerful inspection teams and dispatched them to various places for weekly inspections. During the inspection, it was found that the depth and breadth of the campaign were very uneven. In nineteen cities and counties, such as Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Tonghua, and Yongji, where the Four Pests eradication campaign started earlier and the masses were very enthusiastic, the party and government leaders attached great importance to the development of the campaign and took the lead in sweeping snow and launching concentrated efforts to eliminate the Four Pests. Under the conditions of high mass enthusiasm, these regions put forward new goals and strive to eliminate the "Four Pests" in one to two years. However, there are also a few areas, such as Jiutai, Wangqing, Huaide, Fuyu, Hunchun, Qian'an, Anguang, Jingyu, and Changbai counties, which do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the Four Pests eradication campaign, do not have strong leadership determination, and have not comprehensively planned and arranged the patriotic health campaign and other work. Fuyu County planned to stop the health campaign and wait until the grain purchase task was completed and after the Spring Festival before proceeding. Jiutai County had not carried out mobilization for the patriotic health campaign by January 27th, and the county head also emphasized objective difficulties and did not agree to mobilize the masses on Sundays to launch a concentrated health campaign, believing that it would hinder the rest of the staff. These areas have been criticized by the provincial party committee and have begun to pay attention. Currently, these areas are mobilizing the masses to catch up quickly and make up for lost time.

### 抓住时令反复扫荡四害　深入检查彻底消灭死角  吉林力争两三年内成为四无省

    抓住时令反复扫荡四害　深入检查彻底消灭死角
    吉林力争两三年内成为四无省
    据新华社长春14日电　中共吉林省委最近召开全省电话会议，提出除地僻人稀的地方外，要力争在两三年内基本上除尽“四害”，消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，变吉林省为“四无”省。全省人民目前正抓住消灭“四害”的主要时令，鼓起革命干劲，进行有重点的突击运动和反复扫荡。春节前后全省除“四害”运动将进入新的高潮。
    前一时期，全省曾抓住天气寒冷，老鼠、麻雀处在四野无粮，活动范围缩小的时机，展开大规模的捕鼠捉雀运动。仅据三十八个市、县的统计，从1月中旬到2月5日，已捕鼠七十二万七千一百多只，捉雀一百六十三万七千三百多只，出现了一个无鼠镇，一百零八个无鼠屯，三个无鼠街和九十一个无鼠居民委员会。在此同时，全省人民还结合农村积肥运动，突击清除了积雪和垃圾、粪便，防止入春化雪以后，垃圾污物堵塞下水设备，孳生蚊蝇。中共吉林省委在电话会议上，要求各地在春节前，向“四害”（根据吉林省具体情况，目前着重消灭老鼠、麻雀、虱子、蟑螂）发起一次歼灭战，把冬季爱国卫生运动迅速推向新的高潮。这几天，全省人民正按照春节前扫尘的传统卫生习惯，展开全民性的卫生突击运动。
    为了消灭除四害运动的死角和空白点，全省组织了力量雄厚的检查组，分派到各地，每周检查一次。在检查中，发现运动开展的深度和广度很不平衡。除四害运动开展较早、群众干劲很足的长春、吉林、四平、通化、永吉等十九个市、县，党政领导人都非常重视运动的开展，并且自己带头扫雪、突击除四害。这些地区在群众热情高涨的条件下，提出新的奋斗目标，争取在一两年内除尽“四害”。但也还有少数地区，如九台、汪清、怀德、扶余、珲春、乾安、安广、靖宇、长白等九个县，对除“四害”运动的意义认识不足，领导决心不大，没有将爱国卫生运动和其他工作统筹规划，全面安排。扶余县准备把卫生运动停下来，等完成征购粮任务和过了春节以后再进行。九台县的爱国卫生运动到1月27日还没有进行动员，县长还强调客观困难，并且不同意利用星期日发动群众突击卫生工作，认为那样会妨害职工的休息。这类地区已经受到省委批评，开始引起重视。目前这些地区正在发动群众急起猛追，迎头赶上。
