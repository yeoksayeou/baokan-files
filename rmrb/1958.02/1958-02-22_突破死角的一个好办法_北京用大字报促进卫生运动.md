    A Good Way to Break Through Dead Ends
    Beijing Uses Big-Character Posters to Promote the Hygiene Movement
    (Our dispatch) Beijing residents are employing the method of posting big-character posters to criticize and propel some units with poor hygiene conditions to change their backwardness in the campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.
      "Hygiene is something everyone should pay attention to. The government calls for it year after year and promotes it all the time. Why does the Ministry of Commerce neglect this work? … Please, the person in charge of the Ministry of Commerce, pay attention to correcting this." This is a big-character poster posted by residents of Jingsheng Hutong to the Ministry of Commerce. Originally, the staff of the Ministry of Commerce neither swept the streets nor sprinkled water in the past, and the garbage cans were not carried out or collected on time. After the person in charge of the Ministry of Commerce saw the big-character poster, he immediately convened relevant personnel to hold a meeting, formulated an improvement plan based on the residents' criticisms and opinions, and sent cadres to actively contact the street office to solicit opinions. Now, every day, people from the Ministry of Commerce come out to sweep the streets with the masses to maintain the cleanliness of the area they are responsible for. After the staff dormitory of the Wuhua Medical Equipment Factory in Qianmen District was criticized by residents with big-character posters, the factory director immediately discussed the matter with the party branch secretary and the chairman of the trade union and carried out cleaning that very day. After the Dongliulichang Residents' Committee posted a big-character poster criticizing a workshop of the Xinlian Paper Box Factory, the factory director immediately convened a meeting. Not only was the workshop cleaned that noon, but other workshops were also cleaned in the evening. The dormitory of the Qianmen District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Wei Ran Hutong, although the housing conditions were very good, was very dirty. After being criticized by the Wei Ran Hutong Residents' Committee with big-character posters, they immediately cleaned it that afternoon and elected three hygiene supervisors. The processing workshop of the Beijing Fifth Wood Production Cooperative had not been cleaned for more than a year. The room was full of dust, the roof was covered with cobwebs, and the workers often poured dirty water into the street. Cadres of the Second Residents' Committee of the Chaoyang Market Office in Dongdan District and street activists had repeatedly urged them, but they paid no attention. However, when a big-character poster appeared in front of the workshop, demanding that they quickly clean up, the director of the cooperative immediately rushed to the workshop, mobilized the workers to clean the interior and the street, and elected a workshop hygiene supervisor and established a rotational duty system for cleaning. That day, the workers invited street cadres and residents to inspect, and everyone expressed satisfaction with the cooperative's leadership cadres' action of immediately cleaning up after accepting criticism. After inspection, the interior and exterior were "three clean," and the residents took down the big-character poster they had posted. Some units that were criticized, in addition to immediately cleaning up after accepting criticism, also formulated a system for regular hygiene. The big-character poster at the entrance of the training class of the Beijing Quyi Troupe Three in the east courtyard of Liangjiayuan has been replaced by a large "happiness" character, indicating that they have achieved "four noes." After being criticized, the training class formulated a system of carrying out a general cleaning once a week, and also stipulated that students, staff, workers, and others should be assigned to different areas and be responsible for the hygiene of classrooms, offices, kitchens, and other places.

    突破死角的一个好办法
    北京用大字报促进卫生运动
    本报讯　北京市的许多居民在除四害、讲卫生运动中，采用贴大字报进行批评的方法，推动了一些卫生不好的单位，改变了落后状况。
      “卫生是人人应当注意的事情。政府年年号召，时时宣传，而商业部为什么忽视这个工作？……请商业部负责人注意改正。”这是敬胜胡同居民给商业部贴的大字报。原来，商业部的工作人员过去既不扫街，也不泼水，垃圾箱也不按时抬出、收回。商业部负责人看了大字报以后就召集有关人员开会，根据居民们的批评和意见，订出了改进方案，并且派干部主动和街道办事处联系，征求意见。现在商业部每天都有人出来和群众一道扫街，保持责任保洁地段的清洁。前门区五华医疗器械厂的职工宿舍被居民贴大字报批评以后，这个厂的厂长立即同党支部书记和工会主席做了研究，并在当天进行了扫除。东琉璃厂居民委员会给新联纸盒厂一个车间贴了批评的大字报以后，厂长立刻召开会议，不但这个车间在当天中午进行了扫除，其他车间也在晚间进行了扫除。中共前门区委在魏染胡同的宿舍，虽然房子条件很好，但院内很脏。经魏染胡同居民委员会贴大字报批评以后，当天下午也立即进行了打扫，还选出了三名卫生负责人。北京市第五木器生产合作社加工车间已经有一年多没有打扫了，室内到处是灰尘，屋顶上挂满了灰网，工人们还常往街上乱泼脏水。东单区朝阳市场办事处第二居民委员会的干部和街道积极分子屡次督促他们，但都不加理睬。但当这个车间门口出现了一张居民要求他们迅速扫除的大字报后，这个社的主任立即赶到车间，动员工人们把室内和街道打扫得干干净净，并且选出了车间卫生负责人，建立了轮流值日打扫的制度。当天工人们并请街道干部和居民来检查，大家对这个社的领导干部接受批评立即打扫的行动表示满意，经过检查，室内外也做到了“三洁”，居民们便把自己贴的大字报揭下来了。有些被批评的单位在接受批评后，除立即进行打扫外，还订出了卫生经常化的制度。北京市曲艺三团在梁家园东大院的训练班门口的大字报已被标志做到“四无”的大喜字代替了。这个训练班在被批评后订出了每周进行一次大扫除的制度，还规定由学员、工作人员、工友等分片包干，负责教室、办公室、厨房等地的卫生工作。　（新华社专稿）
