Respected Chairman Comrade! Respected Comrades and Friends!

Today, we are here with great joy and delight to attend this grand gathering to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces.

For forty years, the Soviet Armed Forces, established by the Communist Party headed by the great Lenin, have experienced an arduous combat path to defend the achievements of the October Socialist Revolution; it has crushed two armed aggressions against our country by imperialists.

The victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union aroused the frenzied hatred of international imperialism. Therefore, the imperialists colluded with the overthrown Russian exploiting classes and mobilized all their forces to strangle the young Soviet Republic.

Defending the Achievements of the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Army Twice Crushed the Enemy's Offensive

In the summer of 1918, Soviet Russia was surrounded by enemies on all sides. Interventionists and White bandits occupied three-quarters of our motherland's territory; they established a bloody reign of terror in the occupied areas.

Under the leadership of Lenin, the Communist Party mobilized the entire Soviet people to wage a sacred struggle against the enemy. It was precisely the wise leadership of the Communist Party that ensured the victory over the enemies of our motherland during the period of foreign intervention and civil war.

The Soviet people and their young army fought hard for three years against numerous enemies under conditions of extreme hardship, hunger, cold, poverty, and economic destruction. This struggle was severe and arduous, and sometimes almost desperate. The enemy clamored for the inevitable demise of the Soviet regime and even prepared to celebrate victory. However, the Soviet people and their armed forces, inspired by the great ideal of the motherland's freedom and independence, defeated the counter-revolutionary army and drove out the remnants of the interventionists.

Back in those years, the superiority of the new social system over the capitalist system had already been demonstrated; the perseverance and fearlessness of the Soviet people, who were liberated from exploitation and oppression and understood the significance of the Soviet regime, were demonstrated.

The Soviet people's just struggle against foreign aggressors received the deep sympathy and support of workers in various countries.

Thousands of foreign working people, including more than 30,000 glorious sons of the Chinese people, fought heroically alongside the Soviet people in the civil war.

The Soviet people and their young army's victory over the combined offensive of the interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionary forces was the most disastrous military and political defeat for world imperialism. The malicious lie spread by the imperialists that the Soviet regime was imposed on the people by the Bolsheviks was reduced to ashes in the flames of the civil war. The victory of the Soviet people demonstrated clearly and eloquently the loyalty of the broad masses of the people to the socialist system; this victory demonstrated the great vitality and invincibility of the Soviet state born out of the October Revolution of 1917; it demonstrated the determination of the Soviet people to advance along the glorious path of building socialism.

On June 22, 1941, the German fascist bandits, fostered and instigated by British, French, and American imperialism, perfidiously invaded our territory. This was the second armed aggression against our country by the imperialists.

The fascist bandits who invaded our country attempted to destroy the Soviet social and state system, undermine the socialist achievements of the Soviet people of all nationalities, restore the rule of landlords and capitalists in our country, and enslave the Soviet people. Before the fascist German attack on the Soviet Union, the Hitler bandit gang had almost occupied the whole of Western Europe. In the capitalist world, there was no longer any force capable of stopping fascist aggression. Only the Soviet Army—a new type of army established and nurtured by the Communist Party—could be called such a force.

When the situation was extremely unfavorable to us in the early days of the war, our people and the men of the land and naval forces were forced to undergo extremely severe tests. The Hitler bandit gang perfidiously violated the non-aggression pact and attacked the Soviet Union with an army armed to the teeth. This army had two years of war experience, and it relied on the economy of almost the whole of Europe, with a population of 250 million and an annual production of 45 million tons of steel. This was the most powerful army in the capitalist world.

When it attacked the Soviet Union, it had more than seven million officers and soldiers, 20,000 aircraft, and 14,000 tanks.

Taking advantage of its temporary superiority, the enemy occupied important economic regions of our country in a short period of time, including the Donbas and Krivoy Rog region—the Soviet Union's main coal and metallurgical bases before the war, and occupied the richest regions of Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic coast, and Moldavia. The fascist bandit army directed its main blows at Moscow and Leningrad. Our motherland faced the danger of extinction.

However, these trials did not destroy the motherland's fighting will, nor did they shake the tenacious spirit of the Soviet people and their belief in the inevitable victory of their just cause. Under the leadership of Lenin's party, the Soviet people and their armed forces transformed into a unified combat camp, mobilizing all human and material resources to defeat the enemy. Soviet patriots launched a powerful guerrilla movement behind enemy lines. The superiority of the Soviet socialist social and state system enabled us to use all our strength to bring about a turning point in the war and then completely crush the enemy.

The fundamental socialist transformation carried out by the Soviet Union during the pre-war five-year plans was the foundation for the victory in the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet social and state system, the unbreakable worker-peasant alliance, the ardent patriotism of the Soviet people united around their leader and organizer—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, gained victory, and the wise policy of the Communist Party gained victory.

It must be pointed out that the Second Front in Western Europe was opened almost two years later than the stipulated deadline. By then, it was very clear that the Soviet Armed Forces were capable of single-handedly crushing the German fascist army and liberating the European people oppressed by the Hitler bandit gang.

In August 1945, the Soviet army began to fight against Japanese imperialism, inflicting a devastating blow on the elite troops of the Japanese Kwantung Army, thus playing an extremely important role in defeating imperialist Japan.

The Soviet Army Possesses the Latest Technological Equipment; Warmongers Who Dare to Provoke Will Not Escape Punishment

Like the people of all socialist countries, the Soviet people are engaged in peaceful construction and do not want war. The Communist Party and the Soviet government represent the will of the people, pursue a policy of peace, and consistently oppose war. From 1955 to 1956, the Soviet government unilaterally reduced its armed forces by a total of 1.84 million people, which is proof of this.

Not long ago, it was decided to reduce the army and navy by another 300,000 people. The Soviet Union has also put forward proposals such as prohibiting the testing, use, and production of atomic weapons and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, which are well known.

However, monopoly capital groups are unwilling to ease international tensions, unwilling to abandon the "Cold War" policy, and are doing everything possible to obstruct the settlement of urgent international issues through negotiations. They get rich by creating an atmosphere of war frenzy, extorting heavy taxes from the people, and obtaining incredible profits in arms production.

The complex international situation and the need to defend the interests of our motherland require all Soviet people to fight unremittingly to implement the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU: to maintain the defense of socialist countries at the level of modern military technology and science.

Thanks to the care of the Communist Party, the Soviet Army and Navy have mastered all the latest technological weapons and equipment, including atomic and thermonuclear weapons. The Soviet Armed Forces possess excellent ships, powerful aviation, armored forces, artillery, and various rocket weapons. If the warmongers dare to launch a war, there is now no place in the world where they can escape the severe punishment of justice.

The Communist Party constantly cares about consolidating the morale of the Soviet Army and the political education of Soviet soldiers. In this regard, the resolution of the October Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee played an extremely important and beneficial role. The resolution condemned the non-Party stance of former Minister of Defense Comrade Zhukov. The line pursued by Zhukov was to detach our armed forces from the Communist Party, weaken the Party organization, and virtually abolish the political organs in the army and navy.

The resolution of the October Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee will further enhance the Party's role in leading the armed forces. In this document, in the spirit of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, a concrete program is put forward for fundamentally improving Party and political work in the army and navy. All personnel of the army and navy, all Soviet people, unanimously and enthusiastically support this resolution of great significance.

All personnel of the army and navy are more closely united around the Communist Party, its Central Committee, and the Soviet government. Soviet soldiers are expanding their ties with local Party and Soviet organs, social organizations, enterprises, collective farms, and various institutions. Commanders, political organs, and Party organizations are carrying out tremendous work, educating soldiers with the glorious history of the Communist Party, the heroic labor examples of the Soviet people building communism, the spirit of infinite loyalty to the motherland and the cause of the Party, the combat traditions of the Soviet Armed Forces, proletarian internationalism, and friendship with peace-loving people of all countries.

The Combat Friendship Between the Armies of China and the Soviet Union Will Continue to Be Consolidated and Developed

Soviet soldiers and all Soviet people highly value the heroic revolutionary struggles waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the years under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the support of the broad masses of the people against feudalism, foreign aggressors, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the American aggression against Korea. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has completed the tasks entrusted to it by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people and has been tempered and developed in this struggle.

This struggle has achieved a brilliant victory, thereby creating the conditions for the founding of the People's Republic of China.

A solid combat friendship has been forged between the Soviet Armed Forces and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This friendship was forged in the battles of Soviet and Chinese soldiers fighting side by side against Japanese imperialism on Chinese soil.

This friendship is being consolidated day by day. Chinese soldiers are studying the combat experience of the Soviet army, and Soviet soldiers are also learning many beneficial things from our Chinese combat brothers.

We are proud that there is a friendly and close cooperative relationship between our people and the great Chinese people, and between the Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This relationship is based on the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950. We are happy that we have such loyal friends and combat comrades as the great Chinese people and their armed forces.

The presentation of the military flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Soviet Army is a new and extremely vivid expression of the close friendship between the people and armies of our two countries. This flag will inspire the soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy to serve the motherland and the cause of communism more selflessly.

The Soviet Armed Forces are closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet people. They have been tempered in the struggle against numerous enemies of the motherland and have won combat honors. Now, they vigilantly defend the peaceful labor and national interests of the Soviet people. They are always ready to carry out the orders of the Soviet government and repel any aggressor.

Allow me, on behalf of the Soviet Armed Forces, to wish you, dear comrades and friends, new and brilliant victories in the cause of building a new, prosperous, and socialist China!

Long live the great Chinese people and their heroic People's Liberation Army!

Long live the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China!

May the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people and armed forces of the two great powers, the Soviet Union and China, be increasingly consolidated and developed!

    苏联军队沿着胜利的道路前进
    苏联驻华武官朱道夫少将在庆祝苏军建军四十周年大会上的讲话敬爱的主席同志！敬爱的同志们和朋友们！
    今天，我们怀着非常欣慰和万分愉快的心情，来参加这个庆祝苏联武装部队建军四十周年的盛大集会。
    四十年来，以伟大列宁为首的共产党所建立的苏联武装部队，为保卫十月社会主义革命的成果而经历了艰巨的战斗道路；它粉碎了帝国主义者对我国进行的两次武装侵略。
    十月革命在苏联的胜利，引起了国际帝国主义疯狂的仇恨，因此，帝国主义者勾结被打倒了的俄国剥削阶级，动员一切力量来扼杀年青的苏维埃共和国。
    保卫十月社会主义革命的成果，苏联军队两次粉碎敌人的进攻
    1918年夏天，苏维埃俄罗斯被敌人四面包围。干涉者和白匪军侵占了我们祖国四分之三的土地；他们在占领区建立了血腥的恐怖政权。
    共产党在列宁的领导下，发动了全体苏联人民与敌人进行神圣的斗争。正是共产党的英明领导，保证了在外国干涉和国内战争时期战胜我们祖国的敌人。
    苏联人民和他们年青的军队在万分艰苦，饥寒交迫，贫穷和经济破坏的条件下，与为数众多的敌人进行了三年苦战。这个斗争是严重而艰巨的，有时几乎是处于绝境的。敌人叫嚣着苏维埃政权的必然灭亡，甚至准备庆祝胜利。然而，苏联人民及其武装部队，却在祖国自由独立的伟大理想鼓舞下，把反革命军队打得落花流水，干涉者的残余部队也被驱逐出去了。
    早在那些年代就已经显示出了新的社会制度对于资本主义制度的优越性；显示出了从剥削压迫下获得解放，并且理解苏维埃政权意义的苏联人民所具有的那种坚忍不拔和大无畏精神。
    苏联人民反对外国侵略者的正义斗争，得到了各国工人深厚的同情和支援。
    在国内战争中与苏联人民并肩英勇战斗的，有成千上万的外国劳动人民，其中包括三万多中国人民光荣的儿子。
    苏联人民和他们年青的军队战胜了干涉者和国内反革命势力的联合进攻，这是世界帝国主义在军事上政治上最惨重的失败。帝国主义者说苏维埃政权是布尔什维克强加在人民头上的，这种恶毒的谎言在国内战争的战火中已化为乌有了。苏联人民的胜利，显明而又雄辩地证明了广大人民群众对社会主义制度的忠诚；这个胜利表现了诞生于1917年十月革命中的苏维埃国家伟大的生命力和不可战胜性；表现了苏联人民沿着建设社会主义的光辉道路前进的决心。
    1941年6月22日，为英、法、美帝国主义所豢养和唆使的德国法西斯匪帮，背信弃义地侵入我国领土。这是帝国主义者对我国进行的第二次武装侵略。
    侵入我国的法西斯匪徒，妄图摧毁苏联的社会制度和国家制度，破坏苏联各族人民的社会主义成就，在我国恢复地主和资本家的统治，奴役苏联人民。法西斯德国进攻苏联以前，希特勒匪帮几乎占领了整个西欧。在资本主义世界中已经没有一种力量能够阻止法西斯的侵略。只有苏军——由共产党建立和培养起来的新型军队——才称得上是这种力量。
    当战争初期，情况对我们极端不利的时候，我国人民和陆、海军军人被迫经受了极为严酷的考验。希特勒匪帮背信弃义地破坏了互不侵犯协定，以武装到牙齿的军队向苏联进攻。这支军队具有两年的战争经验，它依靠着拥有二亿五千万人口和每年生产四千五百万吨钢的几乎整个欧洲的经济。这是资本主义世界最强大的军队。
    当它进攻苏联的时候，它拥有七百多万官兵、两万架飞机和一万四千辆坦克。
    敌人利用它暂时的优势，在短时间内侵占了我国重要的经济地区，包括顿巴斯和克里沃罗格区——苏联战前主要的煤和冶金基地，侵占了乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波罗的海沿岸和莫尔达维亚最富饶的地区。法西斯匪军将主要的打击指向莫斯科和列宁勒格。我们祖国面临着灭亡的危险。
    然而，这些考验并没有摧毁祖国的战斗意志，并没有动摇苏联人民的顽强精神和他们对自己的正义事业的必胜信念。在列宁的党领导之下，苏联人民及其武装部队变成为统一的战斗阵营，动员了一切人力和物力来战胜敌人。苏联爱国者在敌后展开了强大的游击运动。苏联社会主义社会制度和国家制度的优越性，使我们能够将一切力量都用来造成战争的转折并进而彻底粉碎敌人。
    苏联在战前五年计划期间所进行的社会主义根本改造，是伟大卫国战争胜利的基础。苏联的社会制度和国家制度、牢不可破的工农联盟、团结在自己的领袖和组织者——苏联共产党周围的苏联人民的炽热的爱国主义，获得了胜利，共产党的英明政策获得了胜利。
    必须指出，西欧第二战场是在迟于规定期限将近两年之后才开辟的。那时已经非常明显地可以看出，苏联武装部队能够单独地粉碎德国法西斯军队，解放在希特勒匪帮压迫下的欧洲人民。
    1945年8月，苏联军队开始对日本帝国主义作战，给了日本关东军精锐部队以歼灭性的打击，从而在战胜帝国主义日本方面起了极其重要的作用。
    苏军掌握了最新式的技术装备，战争贩子如敢挑衅将难逃惩罚
    苏联人民和各个社会主义国家的人民一样，从事着和平建设，不希望战争。共产党和苏联政府代表人民的意志，执行着和平政策，坚持不懈地反对战争。从1955至1956年间，苏联政府单方面裁减自己的武装部队共达一百八十四万人，这就是证明。
    不久以前又决定再度裁减陆海军三十万人。苏联提出了禁止试验、使用和生产原子武器，在中欧建立无原子武器区域等建议，也都是人所共知的。
    但是，垄断资本集团不愿意缓和国际紧张局势，不愿意放弃“冷战”政策，并且千方百计地阻挠用谈判的方法解决迫切的国际问题。他们靠着战争狂热的气氛发财致富，向人民榨取重税，在军火生产方面获得令人难以置信的暴利。
    复杂的国际局势和为了保卫我们祖国的利益，要求全体苏联人民为贯彻执行苏共第二十次代表大会的指示而坚持不懈地斗争：要将社会主义国家的国防保持在现代军事技术和科学的水平上。
    由于共产党的关怀，苏联陆、海军掌握着一切最新式的技术兵器和装备，包括原子武器和热核武器。苏联武装部队拥有出色的舰艇、强大的航空兵、装甲兵、炮兵及各种火箭武器。如果战争贩子敢于发动战争，现在世界上已再也没有地方可以使他们逃避掉正义的严厉的惩罚。
    共产党经常关怀着苏军士气的巩固和苏联军人的政治教育。在这方面，苏共中央十月全会的决议起了极其重大的、良好的作用。决议谴责了前国防部长朱可夫同志的非党立场。朱可夫奉行的路线是：使我国的武装部队脱离共产党，削弱党的组织，和实际上取消陆、海军中的政治机关。
    苏共中央十月全会的决议，将进一步提高党在领导武装部队中的作用。在这份文件里，根据苏共二十次代表大会的精神，提出了从根本上改进陆、海军中党和政治工作的具体纲领。陆、海军全体人员、全体苏联人民，一致热烈拥护这一具有重大意义的决议。
    陆、海军全体人员更加紧密地团结在共产党及其中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。苏联军人正在扩大与地方党和苏维埃机关、社会团体、企业、集体农庄和各个机关的联系。指挥员、政治机关和党组织，正在进行巨大的工作，用共产党的光荣历史、苏联人民建设共产主义的英勇劳动事例，用无限忠诚于祖国和党的事业的精神，用苏联武装部队的战斗传统，用无产阶级国际主义以及与爱好和平的各国人民友好的精神教育军人。
    中苏两国军队的战斗友谊将会继续获得巩固和发展
    苏联军人和全体苏联人民极为重视中国人民解放军多年来在中国共产党的英明领导和广大人民群众支持之下所进行的反对封建、反对外国侵略者、反对国民党反动派以及美国侵略朝鲜的英勇的革命斗争。中国人民解放军完成了中国共产党和中国人民交给它的任务，并在这一斗争中得到了锻炼和发展。
    这一斗争取得了光辉的胜利，从而为中华人民共和国的成立创造了条件。
    苏联武装部队和中国人民解放军之间结成了巩固的战斗友谊。这种友谊是在苏中军人在中国土地上并肩反对日本帝国主义的战斗中结成的。
    这种友谊在一天天地巩固。中国军人研究着苏联军队的战斗经验，而苏联军人也从我们中国战斗兄弟方面吸取许多有益的东西。
    我们感到自豪的是，我国人民和伟大的中国人民、苏联军队和中国人民解放军之间，存在着友好和密切合作关系。这种关系是以1950年2月14日签订的友好同盟互助条约为基础的。我们感到幸福的是，我们有伟大的中国人民及其武装部队这样忠诚的朋友和战斗同志。
    将中国人民解放军的军旗赠给苏联军队，乃是我们两国人民和军队之间亲密友谊的新的极其鲜明的表现。这面旗帜将鼓舞着苏联陆、海军的军人更加忘我地为祖国、为共产主义事业服务。
    苏联武装部队紧密地团结在共产党和苏联人民的周围，它在同人数众多的祖国的敌人斗争中得到了锻炼，并获得了战斗荣誉。现在，它警惕地保卫着苏联人民的和平劳动和国家利益。他们随时准备执行苏联政府的命令，回击任何侵略者。
    请允许我代表苏联武装部队，祝您们，亲爱的同志们和朋友们，在建设新的、繁荣的、社会主义中国的事业中获得新的、光辉的胜利！
    伟大的中国人民及其英勇的人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    祝苏中两大国人民及其武装部队之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊日益巩固与发展！
