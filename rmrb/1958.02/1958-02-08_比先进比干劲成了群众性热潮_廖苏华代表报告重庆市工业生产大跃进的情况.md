I completely agree with and support the reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and Director Wu Yuzhang, and I am determined to implement them in my practical work.

Under the impetus of the rectification movement, national industrial and agricultural production is developing rapidly. Chongqing is an industrial city, and I will now report to the conference on the leap forward in industrial production in Chongqing.

　　Factories and Mines Strive for a Great Leap Forward in Production - Original Plans to be Surpassed Again and Again

The factories and mines in Chongqing, after achieving a decisive victory in the anti-rightist struggle in the third quarter of last year, fully launched the rectification and socialist education movement. Initially, we put forward the slogan of "rectification and production without hindering each other," but the practice of the movement proved that even during the period of great airing of views, rectification not only did not delay production but also powerfully promoted production. Especially after the centralized rectification phase in November last year, the work style of leaders at all levels has greatly improved, the opinions raised by the masses have been seriously and promptly dealt with, and many key problems hindering production have been solved. This has greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm and political fervor of the workers, triggering a new, vigorous, and magnificent high tide of industrial production among the masses. Therefore, the city's production plan for the fourth quarter of last year was completed excellently, with the actual output value increasing by 22.64 percent compared with the third quarter. The city's total industrial output value for 1957 was 108.24 percent, successfully completing the First Five-Year Plan. At the end of last year, as the production high tide deepened, the city's workers studied Comrade Shaoqi's congratulatory speech at the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions and the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). People were inspired and became even more energetic. They further recognized the grand prospects for the development of industry and agriculture in our country and responded to the Central Committee's great call to catch up with and surpass Britain in major industrial products such as coal, steel, and electricity within fifteen years. At present, factories and mines are responding to these requirements by making guarantees, taking measures, and revising their original plans to strive for a great leap forward in production. The preliminary revised production value plan for central industries is generally about 20 percent higher than the original plan. For factories and mines with no problems in raw materials and sales, the increased production plan exceeds the original plan by 50 to 100 percent. The city's total output value of local industry is tentatively set to increase by more than 30 percent over last year. The city's capital construction is preparing to reduce investment by 10 percent while ensuring the original projects and engineering quality, saving the state 17 million yuan in investment.

To achieve the above major indicators in the great leap forward in production, the city's workers have full confidence and assurance because:

　　The New High Tide Has a Deep Mass Foundation - A Reliable Guarantee for the Great Leap Forward in Production

1. This new high tide of industrial production and the great leap forward in production emerged during the rectification movement, and it has a broad and deep mass foundation. This is a reliable guarantee for achieving a great leap forward in production.

First of all, the vast number of workers have greatly improved their political awareness in the rectification movement. This is prominently manifested in the further promotion of the working class's enthusiasm and creativity in production, the spirit of collectivism of unity and fraternity, and the full embodiment of the principles of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together" in production competitions. This is an important political condition for promoting a great leap forward in production. In this atmosphere of close unity in doing a good job in production and improving production, workers consciously launched socialist labor competitions between different types of work, between teams and groups, and between individuals, and mutually formulated competition conditions, making socialist labor competitions and the advanced producers movement more vivid, lively, in-depth, and widespread. Because in the competition, classes and groups actively exchanged experiences and jointly sought ways to protect equipment, many experiences that could not be promoted for a long time were successfully promoted, and the lifespan of equipment was extended. This greatly promoted production. For example, in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the lifespan of open-hearth furnaces has reached 620 heats, exceeding the national advanced level, thanks to workers assisting each other and improving technology, especially the mass-based furnace protection work. On February 1, they proposed moving towards 700 heats, which is a great leap forward in steel production. In the heated competition, advanced figures and advanced deeds continued to emerge. For example, Sun Hongliang, an old worker at Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant, organized all the workers in his group to propose using waste tools within two years, not receiving new tools, protecting equipment, and ensuring that five machine tools would not be repaired. Under the impetus of this upsurge, the plant proposed a struggle target of increasing production by 10 million yuan this year, accounting for 18.64 percent of the total annual output value, and saving 6.85 million yuan.

Secondly, in the movement, especially after rectification, airing of views, and socialist education, as the three styles of leadership began to be overcome and some unreasonable systems and regulations in factories and mines were initially improved, the relationship between cadres and workers improved, and workers loved and supported the Party's leadership even more. In particular, many old workers played their backbone leading role even more politically and in production. Since 1956, Chongqing's industrial and mining enterprises have absorbed more than 60,000 new workers, most of whom came from schools and rural areas and had not undergone labor training. Therefore, they had some excessive demands in life and showed some phenomena of not complying with labor discipline in production. In the great rectification debate, many old workers used their personal experiences to explain the pain they had personally experienced before liberation, which profoundly educated the new workers. Some old workers said: "In the past, workers were buried in ditches when they died, and buried on the road when they died; now they have holidays when they go home and subsidies for travel expenses, and they receive pensions when they are old. The Communist Party is really thoughtful!" This vivid recall and comparison had great educational significance. Some actively withdrew some excessive and unreasonable demands in the past, and fewer people applied for housing and subsidies. They generally proposed adjusting unreasonable wage and welfare systems and expressed their support for the four draft regulations promulgated by the State Council. The policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running enterprises diligently and thriftily has taken root in the hearts of the people, and increasing production and practicing economy and opposing waste have become the conscious actions of the vast number of people. After the socialist debate, more than 90 percent of the apprentices in some steel plants basically correctly understood the relationship between developing production and improving life, the relationship between individual interests and national interests, and the relationship between the working class and the peasants. Therefore, they expressed their willingness to reduce their existing allowance by about 20 percent. Apprentices in other factories and mines have similar demands. After socialist education, the old workers' sense of ownership in production became even stronger. Many old workers in the factory organized construction teams, used their spare time to collect waste materials, repair machines, and solve key technical problems in production. Under the promotion of the leading role of the old workers, comparing advanced, competing with enthusiasm, learning from advanced, and catching up with advanced has become a mass upsurge. These facts fully demonstrate that "the rectification movement is the key to lifting all work." Through the rectification movement, the face of factories and mines has been completely renewed.

　　Vigorously Carry Out the Anti-Waste Movement - Production Potential Can Still Be Greatly Tapped

2. We have great potential for achieving a great leap forward in production, which needs to be vigorously tapped.

First, we successfully and comprehensively overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan. At the end of the First Five-Year Plan, the city's total industrial output value increased by 223.46 percent compared with 1952, with an average annual increase of 31.73 percent, expanding the variety and cultivating a large number of technical forces, laying a reliable foundation for the city to organize a great leap forward in production and complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This shows on the one hand that the speed of industrial growth is amazing, reflecting the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and on the other hand, it also shows that the central government's correct principle of "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture on the basis of developing heavy industry."

Secondly, the production potential of factories and mines has not been fully exploited, and there is huge potential in production management, labor organization, and equipment utilization. According to incomplete statistics: the utilization rate of metal cutting machine tools in the city is only 65.71 percent; the utilization rate of forging equipment is only 49.67 percent; and the equipment utilization rate of the textile industry is only about 60 percent. At present, in the new high tide of production, workers have put forward many suggestions for improving management, improving equipment, rationally adjusting labor organization, and improving technology. Factories and mines are concentrating their efforts to solve them to fully exploit the potential in production.

In the process of rectification, factories and mines found that the waste and losses in production were very large. This not only does not conform to the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, but also is a major obstacle to achieving a great leap forward in production. If we carefully calculate and tap the potential, and invest the wasted and lost resources into production, we can invest less, do more, and promote a great leap forward in production. Therefore, all aspects of the city, especially factories and mines, have specially set aside a period of time in the rectification phase and are vigorously conducting a special airing of views and special rectification against waste. Leaders at all levels are very determined and personally grasp this movement. This plays a great role in promoting the leap forward in production. According to the preliminary investigation of 27 central industrial and mining enterprises in the city, the waste and losses are very serious. Generally, calculated from several aspects such as waste product losses, capital backlog, downtime losses, low quotas, design waste, and waste in non-production expenditures, they account for about 20 percent of the working capital. Calculated only from these 27 factories and mines, 40 million yuan can be saved this year, which is a large amount of wealth. The savings not only accumulate funds for the country and reduce costs, ensuring a certain amount of funds and raw materials in the great leap forward in production; more importantly, they enable the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running enterprises diligently and thriftily to be deeply implemented in practical actions, cultivating and developing the good customs of diligence and thrift among workers, and better comprehensively implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical.

In achieving the above great production leap forward, we may encounter some difficulties, such as the supply of certain raw materials and technological improvements. However, based on the above-mentioned many favorable factors, especially the determination to rely on the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses, we believe that difficulties can be overcome. Therefore, we express with full confidence: starting from the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, we will make the greatest efforts to achieve the greatest results. At present, we are deepening the rectification movement and striving for a comprehensive and thorough victory in the rectification movement. In the rectification movement, we will continue to overcome the three styles and focus on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking among leaders at all levels so that the leading ideology can correctly recognize the current new situation and combine with the enthusiasm of the masses, conscientiously organize the vast number of workers to deeply carry out socialist competitions, further promote the development of the socialist construction upsurge, and strive to achieve a great leap forward in production and accelerate the socialist construction of our country.

　　比先进比干劲成了群众性热潮
    廖苏华代表报告重庆市工业生产大跃进的情况
    我完全同意和拥护李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、薄一波副总理、吴玉章主任的几个报告，并坚决在实际工作中贯彻执行。
    全国工农业生产在整风运动的推动下，正突飞猛进地向前大发展。重庆是一个工业城市，我现在就重庆市工业生产跃进的情况向大会作一汇报。
    各厂矿力争生产大跃进  原订计划要突破再突破
    重庆市的厂矿企业，在去年第三季度反右派斗争取得决定性胜利之后，全面展开了整风和社会主义教育运动。最初我们提出了生产整风两不误的口号，但运动的实践证明，即使在大鸣大放期间，整风不但没有耽误生产，而且有力地推动了生产前进。特别是去年十一月份各厂矿经过集中整改阶段以后，各级领导干部的作风有了很大的改进，群众提出来的意见得到了认真和及时的处理，许多障碍生产的关键问题得到了解决，大大地激发了职工的生产积极性和政治热情，在群众中掀起了一个新的蓬勃壮阔的工业生产高潮。所以去年第四季度全市的生产计划完成得很出色，实际产值较第三季度增长百分之二十二点六四。全市一九五七年工业总产值完成百分之一百零八点二四，胜利完成了第一个五年计划。去年年底在生产高潮深入发展的时候，全市职工学习了少奇同志在全国第八次工会代表大会上的祝词和全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）以后，人心振奋，劲头更大，更加认识到我国工农业发展的宏大远景，纷纷响应中央在十五年内，要在煤、钢铁和电力等主要工业产品方面赶上并超过英国的伟大号召。目前，各厂矿企业都根据以上要求，纷纷提出保证，采取措施，修改原订计划，力争生产大跃进。中央工业初步修订的生产总值计划，一般都较原订计划提高百分之二十左右，有的原材料和销路没有问题的厂矿，增产计划超过了原计划百分之五十至一百。地方工业今年的生产总值初步确定较去年实际增长百分之三十以上。全市基本建设准备在保证原有项目和工程质量的前提下，削减百分之十的投资，为国家节省投资一千七百万元。
    在生产大跃进中，实现上述几项主要指标，全市职工是有充分信心的，有把握的。因为：
    新高潮有深厚群众基础  是生产大跃进可靠保证
    一、这次新的工业生产高潮和生产大跃进是在整风运动中出现的，它具有广阔深厚的群众性的基础。这是能够在生产上实现大跃进的可靠保证。
    首先，广大职工在整风运动中，大大提高了政治觉悟。它突出地表现在进一步发扬了工人阶级在生产中的积极性和创造性、团结友爱的集体主义精神，在生产竞赛中充分体现了
  “互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的原则。这是促进生产大跃进的重要政治条件。就在这种亲密团结搞好生产和提高生产的气氛下，工人们自觉地开展了工种同工种之间，班组同班组之间，个人和个人之间的社会主义劳动竞赛，互相制订了竞赛条件，使社会主义劳动竞赛和先进生产者运动更加生动活泼深入广泛地开展起来了。由于在竞赛中，班与班、组与组相互主动交流经验，共同设法爱护设备，因而许多过去长期不能推广的经验得以顺利推广，设备的寿命延长了。这对于生产的促进很大。例如重庆钢铁公司小平炉车间，在工人互相协助和改进技术，特别开展了群众性的护炉工作下，平炉寿命已达到六百二十炉，超过了全国先进水平，二月一日已提出向七百炉迈进，这是钢铁生产上的大跃进。在热火朝天的竞赛中，先进人物和先进事迹不断涌现。如重庆建设机床厂老工人孙洪亮组织全组工人提出在两年内利用废工具，不领新工具，爱护设备，保证五部机床不检修的倡议。在这种热潮下面，该厂提出了今年增产一千万元，占全年总产值百分之一十八点六四，并节约六百八十五万元的奋斗指标。
    其次，在运动中，特别是在经过整改、鸣放和社会主义教育之后，由于领导上的三个主义开始得到克服，厂矿企业中某些不合理的制度、规定等获得初步改进，因而干部和工人群众之间的关系改善了，工人更加爱戴和拥护党的领导了，特别是许多老工人更加在政治上和生产上发挥了他们的骨干带头作用。全市工矿企业自一九五六年来共约吸收了六万多名新工人，他们大多来自学校和农村，没有经过劳动锻炼。因而在生活上有些过高的要求，在生产上有不遵守劳动纪律的现象。在大整改辩论中，许多老工人采用现身说法的方式说明了自己在解放前所亲身经历过的痛苦，这就深刻地教育了新工人。有的老工人说：“过去工人是沟死沟埋，路死路埋；现在回家又有假期，又补助路费，老了还领养老金，共产党真是想得周到！”这种生动的回忆对比，教育意义很大。有的就主动撤回了过去某些过高的、不合理的要求，申请分房子的、申请补助的减少了，普遍提出调整不合理的工资福利制度，纷纷表示拥护国务院公布的四个规定草案。勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针深入人心，增产节约、反对浪费已成为广大群众的自觉行动。有的钢铁厂通过社会主义大辩论后，百分之九十以上的学徒基本上正确认识了发展生产与改善生活的关系，个人利益与国家利益的关系，以及工人阶级和农民的关系，因而表示愿意将现有的津贴待遇降低百分之二十左右。其它厂矿的学徒也有同样要求。经过社会主义教育，老工人在生产上的主人翁感更为强烈，很多厂的老工人组织施工小组，利用业余时间收集废料，检修机器，解决生产技术上的关键问题。在老工人这种带头作用的推动下，比先进、比干劲、学习先进、赶上先进已成为群众性的热潮。这些事实，充分说明“整风运动是提起一切工作的纲”，通过整风运动，厂矿企业的面貌已焕然一新。
　　大张旗鼓开展反浪费运动  生产潜力还可以大大挖掘
    二、在实现生产大跃进方面，是具备了很大的潜力要我们大力去挖掘的。
    首先，我们胜利地全面超额完成了第一个五年计划。在第一个五年计划期末，全市工业生产总值较一九五二年增长了百分之二百二十三点四六，平均每年递增百分之三十一点七三，扩大了品种，培养了大批的技术力量，为全市组织生产大跃进，提前完成第二个五年计划打下了可靠的基础。这一方面说明工业增长的速度是惊人的，体现了社会主义制度的无比优越，另一方面也说明中央制定的“在发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针”的正确。
    其次，各厂矿企业的生产潜力还没有充分发挥，无论在生产管理、劳动组织、设备利用等方面都蕴藏着巨大的潜力。据不完全的资料统计：全市金属切削机床的利用率只达百分之六十五点七一；锻压设备的利用率只达百分之四十九点六七；纺织工业的设备利用率也只达百分之六十左右。当前，在新的生产高潮当中，职工已纷纷提出改善管理、改进设备、合理调整劳动组织、提高技术等方面的许多建议。各厂矿企业正在集中力量，进行解决，以充分发挥生产上的潜力。
    各厂矿企业在整改当中，发现生产上的浪费损失很大。这不仅不符合勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的精神，也是实现生产大跃进的重大障碍，如果认真地精打细算，挖掘潜力，把浪费损失的资财投入生产，就可以少投资，多办事，促进生产大跃进。因此，全市各个方面，特别是厂矿企业在整改阶段中，专门划出一段时间，正在大张旗鼓地进行一个反浪费的专题鸣放和专题整改。各级领导干部的决心很大，都亲自掌握这一运动。这对于促进生产跃进有很大的作用。根据全市二十七个中央厂矿企业初步摸底的情况来看，浪费损失是很严重的，一般的以废品损失、资金积压、停工损失、定额偏低、设计浪费以及非生产开支中的浪费等几个方面计算，约占流动资金的百分之二十左右。仅以这二十七个厂矿来计算，今年就可节约四千万元，这是一笔很大的财富。节约下来不仅为国家积累了资金，降低了成本，使生产大跃进中资金和原材料得到了一定的保证；更重要的是使勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针得以深入地贯彻到实际行动中去，养成和发挥职工勤劳节俭的良好风气，更好地全面贯彻执行又多、又快、又好、又省的方针。
    在实现以上大生产的跃进中，可能遇到某些困难，如某些原料供应和技术改进等等，但基于上述的许多有利因素，特别是决心依靠群众的智慧和群众的积极性，我们相信困难是可以克服的，因此我们满怀信心地表示：从第二个五年计划开始的头一年起，就以最大的努力作出最大的成绩来。当前我们正在深入整风运动，争取整风运动全面的彻底的胜利。在整风运动中，继续克服三个主义并着重在各级领导干部中反对右倾保守思想，使领导思想能正确认识目前的新形势，并同群众的积极性结合起来，认真组织广大职工群众深入地开展社会主义竞赛，进一步推进社会主义建设高潮的发展，为实现生产大跃进和加速我国社会主义建设而奋斗。
