　　Xiaoshan-Chuanshan Railway Extends to Ningbo
    Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Opens to Traffic
    Xinhua News Agency, Ningbo, 1st. The Xiao (shan) - Chuan (shan town) railway opened to traffic to Ningbo today. So far, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway, which has never been opened to traffic in the history of our country, has opened to traffic. At 6:11 this morning, train No. 118, carrying more than 800 passengers, departed from Ningbo North Station for Shanghai. At noon, freight trains loaded with various seafood products also departed from here to all parts of the province and other parts of the country.
    Ningbo is close to the famous Zhoushan fishing ground. In the past, most of Zhoushan's abundant aquatic products relied on Shanghai for transit, and the transportation volume was limited. Along the 147-kilometer railway line from Ningbo to Xiaoshan, there are rich economic crop areas such as cotton, hemp, and tea, and a large amount of edible salt is also produced on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. After the railway opens to traffic to Ningbo, these materials can be gathered in large quantities through the crisscrossing rivers along the line, and then transported to all parts of the country from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and by sea.
    This railway officially started construction on July 1, 1953, and the section of the line from Ningbo to Chuanshan Town has not yet been completed.
    The construction of the railway from Ningbo to Hangzhou began as early as the end of the Qing Dynasty, but the entire line has never been opened to traffic; moreover, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the original railway project from Xiaoshan to Ningbo was completely destroyed.

### 萧穿铁路修通到宁波  泸杭甬铁路通车了

　　萧穿铁路修通到宁波
    泸杭甬铁路通车了
    新华社宁波1日电　萧（山）穿（山镇）铁路今天通车到宁波。至此，我国历史上从未通车的泸杭甬铁路通车了。今天清晨六点十一分，一一八次列车载着八百多名旅客从宁波北站驶往上海。中午，装载着各种海产的货物列车也从这里开往省内外各地。
    宁波贴近著名的舟山渔场。过去，舟山的丰富水产绝大部分依靠上海转运，运输量受到一定限制。从宁波到萧山一百四十七公里的铁路沿线，是丰富的棉、麻、茶等经济作物地区，杭州湾南岸还出产大量的食盐。在铁路通车到宁波以后，这些物资就可以通过沿线纵横交叉的河流大量汇集起来，再从浙赣、泸杭两线和海运运往全国各地。
    这条铁路是1953年7月1日正式开工的，现在宁波到穿山镇的一段线路还没有修好。
    修建宁波到杭州的铁路，早在清末就开始了，但是全线始终没有通车；而且在抗战时期，从萧山到宁波的原有铁路工程更全部遭到了破坏。
