Hubei Holds On-site Exchange Meeting on Rectification Experiences of Industrial and Transportation Enterprises
    Launching a Campaign for a Major Shift in Cadre Work Style
    "Eating, Living, Working, Entertaining, and Studying Together" with the Masses is the Future Policy
    Carry Forward the Fine Tradition of "Commander Going to the Front Line" to Gradually Achieve Both Red and Expert
    (Our newspaper’s correspondent Geng Weihai reports) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a provincial on-site exchange meeting on rectification experiences of industrial and transportation enterprises, calling for launching a movement of great ideological revolution and major work style transformation in industrial and transportation enterprises throughout the province.
    This meeting mainly studied and discussed the three rectification experiences of Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and Factory 201: First, they began to fundamentally transform the thinking and work style of cadres, using concrete actions to prove that the practice of "eating, living, and working together" with the masses during the land reform period can also be implemented in factories and enterprises, and has achieved preliminary results. Second, during the rectification, they organized some employees to visit and learn from the countryside, and then let them deliberate and connect with the masses, so that the broad masses of employees actively spoke out freely, posted big-character posters, and spontaneously launched a fervent communist education movement, which in turn set off a production upsurge of diligence and thrift in running enterprises and a quality leap forward. Third, they adopted a humble attitude of "learn from wherever there is advanced experience," and based on the current new situation in which agricultural production is at the forefront, organized cadres and workers to learn from advanced people and advanced deeds in the countryside, and used advanced thinking to promote the rectification movement in factories, so that factories quickly showed a new face.
    The meeting criticized the erroneous argument that in the past, some people regarded the "three togethers" in the countryside as "rural viewpoints" and opposed them, and believed that it was necessary to carry forward the fine tradition of the Party's close ties with the masses in previous revolutionary struggles. The meeting decided to establish the "eating, living, working, entertaining, and studying together" of enterprise cadres and the masses as a policy to thoroughly transform the thinking and work style of cadres. The meeting called on enterprise leaders to carry forward the fine tradition of "commander going to the front line" in the revolutionary war, step out of offices, meeting circles, and piles of documents, go to the forefront of production, participate in production, lead production, and gradually achieve both red and expert.
    The meeting believed that since cadres entered the cities, they have learned many scientific enterprise management systems and methods, but some people have also been contaminated by the bureaucratic work style of the bourgeoisie and have become estranged from the masses. It is of epoch-making significance to thoroughly improve the thinking and work style of cadres in this rectification. The meeting called on enterprises throughout the province to combine the current rectification and anti-waste campaign, boldly mobilize the masses, and launch a vigorous and large-scale movement of ideological revolution and work style transformation.
    This meeting eliminated the past formalistic format of listening to large reports, and adopted a meeting method of listening, watching, and discussing simultaneously, so that the problems were solved more centrally and deeply. Many representatives believed that this meeting was like "picture reading," with both principles and specific methods, with both bones and flesh. The representatives from Huangshi City initially had some doubts after listening to the comprehensive introduction of Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, but later they personally saw the big-character posters and production upsurge exhibition of the factory, and after visiting the workers' dormitories, the problems were solved.

    湖北召开工业交通企业整风经验现场交流会议
    掀起干部作风大转变运动
    与群众“同吃，同住，同劳动，同娱乐，同学习”是今后方针
    发扬“司令员上前线”的优良传统，逐步做到又红又专
    本报讯　通讯员耿维海报道：中共湖北省委最近召开的全省工业交通企业整风经验现场交流会议，要求在全省工业交通企业掀起一个思想大革命、作风大转变的运动。
    这次会议主要研究和讨论了武汉国棉一厂和二○一厂的三项整风经验：一是他们开始从根本上转变干部的思想作风，用具体行动证明了在土地改革时期与群众“同吃，同住，同劳动”的作法也能在工厂企业中实行，并且获得初步效果；二是他们在整风中组织部分职工到农村参观学习，然后由他们在群众中酝酿，串连，广大职工积极大鸣大放，贴大字报，自动展开一场热烈的共产主义教育运动，进而掀起了勤俭办企业和质量大跃进的生产高潮；三是他们采取“哪里有先进，就到哪里学”的虚心态度，根据目前农业生产高潮走在前面的新形势，组织干部和工人到农村学习先进人先进事，以先进思想来推动工厂的整风运动，使工厂中很快出现新面貌。
    会议对过去有人把农村“三同”也当做“农村观点”来反对的错误论调进行了批判，认为必须发扬党在历次革命斗争中密切联系群众的优良传统。会议决定把企业干部与群众“同吃，同住，同劳动，同娱乐，同学习”当做一项方针定下来，彻底转变干部的思想作风。会议要求企业领导干部发扬革命战争中“司令员上前线”的优良传统，从办公室、会议圈和文件堆里走出来，到生产最前线去，参加生产，领导生产，逐步做到又红又专。
    会议认为，干部进城以来，学习了许多科学地管理企业的制度和方法，但是有些人也沾染了资产阶级的官僚主义作风，同群众疏远了。在这次整风中彻底改进干部的思想作风，具有划时代的意义。会议要求全省企业结合目前的整改、反浪费，放手发动群众，掀起一个有声有色的大规模的思想大革命、作风大转变的运动。
    这次会议革除了过去听大报告的规格形式，采用边听、边看、边讨论的开会方法，使问题解决得比较集中，比较深透。很多代表认为，这次开会像“看图识字”一样，有原则方针又有具体办法，有骨头也有血肉。黄石市的代表最初听了武汉国棉一厂的全面介绍，还有一些疑问，后来他们亲自看了这个厂的大字报、生产高潮展览会，访问了工人宿舍以后，问题就解决了。
