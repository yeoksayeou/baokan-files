We three, representing our factories, launched the first salvo in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. All the workers are engaged in a production upsurge of "opposing conservatism, opposing waste, comparing with the advanced, and comparing with enthusiasm." The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory is preparing to manufacture more high-quality and low-priced agricultural machinery for our farmer brothers; the Hu County Thermal Power Plant guarantees safe power transmission and reduced coal consumption; the Beijing Repair Factory guarantees the supply of accessories for power plants, shortens working hours, and reduces costs.

We fully support all the reports of the conference and will conscientiously implement them. After listening to these reports, our enthusiasm is even greater. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely overcome all difficulties and victoriously overfulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state.

We three, representing our factories, like many fraternal factories in Beijing, have launched the first salvo in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, and have already overfulfilled the January output value plan. All the workers are engaged in a production upsurge of "opposing conservatism, opposing waste, comparing with the advanced, and comparing with enthusiasm." When discussing the annual and first-quarter production plans, everyone has a common enthusiasm, which is to strive for advancement, to make a great leap forward in the production plan, and then to stick to this advanced goal to the very end. Take the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory as an example. The comrades there understand the great role of their labor in supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. They bravely put forward the slogan "one person does the work of two," and plan to increase this year's total output value by one and a half times compared to last year's actual output value, and reduce total costs by 32%. Taking the ㄍㄊ4.9 type combine harvester as an example, costs can be reduced by 34%. It was also decided to trial-produce 22 new products, including "universal chassis combine harvesters" and so on. This year's design workload is very large, equivalent to the total design workload of the previous eight years. However, the design force will not be increased, and the enthusiasm of the existing personnel will be fully utilized to solve the problem. The workers of the entire factory also plan to use the 350,000 man-hours initially tapped to increase the production of 3,000 rocker-arm harvesters and other products. Manufacturing more high-quality and low-priced agricultural machinery for our farmer brothers has become the daily slogan of all the workers in the factory.

Then take the Shaanxi Hu County Thermal Power Plant where Representative Liu Dezhen is now working (he is from the Shijingshan Power Plant and was temporarily transferred to Hu County last year). After the rectification campaign last year, the enthusiasm of all the workers and masses in the plant was greatly improved. With the help of Soviet experts, at the end of last year, they ensured that two sets of machines and furnaces were put into production ahead of schedule under good trial operation conditions. When the national plan was initially discussed in January, reducing coal consumption alone could save the country about 2,000 tons of coal throughout the year. The youth shock brigade in the plant collected tens of thousands of kilograms of scrap steel and iron in January, saving the country a lot of steel.

After studying the People's Daily editorials "Resolutely Implement the Construction Policy of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical" and "Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves," our minds became clearer. After this stage of anti-waste, we strengthened our awareness of cherishing state property. Liang Zengxi and other veteran workers from the Shijingshan Power Plant recently discovered an open-air coal mine in the plant—a large coal ash pile that had accumulated for one or two decades. Seeing the tight supply of coal in the country, they wanted to use this pile of coal ash, so they dug open the topsoil, took out the coal ash, and asked the leadership to conduct a chemical analysis to see if it could be used. After testing, it was proved that one kilogram of coal ash could replace one kilogram of low-quality coal in terms of heating value, and it could be completely mixed with good coal for burning. This item alone saved the factory more than 7,000 tons of good coal. The factory originally planned to spend 70,000 yuan on unloading fees throughout the year. After discussion by the masses, it turned out that not a single penny needed to be spent, and the unloading task could be completed using the factory's own labor force. This year, it was originally planned that 17,000 man-days of offsite labor would be needed to help with maintenance. After careful calculation by the masses, this plan was also canceled by the workers themselves, which could save 100,000 yuan in expenses. The employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant are also actively learning from the advanced experience of the Yangshupu Power Plant to reduce coal consumption. The original plan was to consume 0.567 kg/kWh, but in January it has been reduced to 0.559 kg/kWh. If the average for the whole year can reach this level, more than 7,000 tons of coal can be saved in a year.

Finally, let me talk about the situation of the Beijing Repair Factory of the Ministry of Electric Power. The technical group of the boiler workshop of the Beijing Repair Factory recently proposed to the technical groups of various workshops: On the condition that the progress plan of the design work is not affected, squeeze out time, use old materials, and assemble a two-ton coal-fired machine for the boiler this year. They have taken on the entire design and manufacturing task of this product. They said that this would not only allow them to receive physical labor training, but also increase their production operation experience, and also save the country 10,000 yuan. On February 5th, the cement pole workshop also achieved a new record of 83 cement poles produced per day. Judging from the current enthusiasm of everyone, the goal of "exceeding Xi'an in terms of cement pole production and quality, and catching up with the Nanjing fraternal factory" that the workers put forward some time ago is completely achievable.

Fellow representatives: This year is the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan and a year of great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country. This conference is a conference to promote the great leap forward in national production. After we go back, we must set off an even higher upsurge in socialist production. Our agricultural machinery factory must guarantee all kinds of agricultural machinery needed for the great leap forward in agricultural production. Our power plant must guarantee safe power transmission, reduce coal consumption, catch up with advanced indicators, and support the production leap forward on various fronts. In order to guarantee the safe power transmission of power plants, our repair factory must guarantee the production of accessories for each power plant. We must shorten working hours, reduce costs, ensure quality, and restore the nameplate output of old and dilapidated equipment.

At the Eighth National Congress of Workers' Representatives, our Party, the political party of the working class, made a great call to us to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or a little more. We responded to this call with great excitement. After this National People's Congress, our enthusiasm is even greater. We must lead all the workers, use all our strength to complete the 1958 economic plan, and strive to build our socialist motherland more, faster, better, and more economically, and to achieve the goal of catching up with Britain within fifteen years ahead of schedule.

    订出先进目标一杆子扎到底
    我们三个人所在的工厂在第二个五年计划的头一年打响了第一炮，全体职工都投入“反保守、反浪费，比先进、比干劲”的生产高潮。北京农业机械厂准备给农民兄弟制造更多的物美价廉的农业机械；鄠县热电厂保证安全送电，降低煤耗；北京修造厂保证供应电厂配件，压短工时，降低成本。
    刘英源　刘德珍　黄润萍代表的联合发言
    我们完全拥护大会的各项报告，并且要认真贯彻执行。我们听了这些报告以后，我们的劲头更大了。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，什么困难我们都一定能够克服，胜利地超额完成国家交给我们的任务。
    我们三个人所在的工厂和北京市其他许多兄弟厂一样，在这第二个五年计划的头一年，打响了头一炮，已经超额完成了一月份的产值计划，全体职工都投入了“反保守、反浪费、比先进、比干劲”的生产高潮。大伙在讨论全年的和第一季度的生产计划的时候，都有一个共同的劲头，就是力争上游，使生产计划来一个大跃进，然后向着这个先进的目标，一竿子扎到底。就拿北京农业机械厂来说，那里的职工同志们都懂得自己的劳动对于支援农业生产大跃进的重大作用，勇敢地提出了“一个人顶两个人干”的口号，计划把今年总产值比去年实际增长一倍半，总成本降低百分之三十二，拿ㄍㄊ4.9型的联合收割机来说，就能降低成本百分之三十四。还决定要试制二十二种新产品，包括“万能底盘联合收割机”等等。今年设计工作量很大，相当于前八年设计工作量的总和。但是并不增加设计力量，用充分发挥现有人员的干劲来解决。全厂工人还计划把初步挖掘出来的三十五万个工时用来增产三千部摇臂式收割机和其他的产品。给农民弟兄制造更多的物美价廉的农业机械已经成为全厂职工的日常口号。
    再拿刘德珍代表现在所在的陕西鄠县热电厂来说（他是石景山发电厂的，去年临时借调到鄠县去工作），去年整风以后，全厂职工群众，经过大鸣大放，积极性大大提高，在苏联专家的帮助之下，去年年底保证了两台机炉在试运良好的情况下，提前投入了生产。今年一月里初步讨论国家计划时，光是降低煤耗一项，全年就可以给国家节煤两千吨左右，厂内的青年突击队在一月份搜集的废钢废铁，就有几万斤。给国家节约了许多钢材。
    我们学习了人民日报社论“坚决执行多、快、好、省的建设方针”、“乘风破浪”等文件以后，头脑更清醒了，经过这阶段的反浪费，加强了爱护国家财物的思想。石景山发电厂老工人梁增喜等同志最近发现了厂内有个露天煤矿——一个有一二十年堆积起来的大煤灰堆。他们看到国家煤炭供应紧张，就想利用这堆煤灰，就挖开浮土，取出煤灰，要求领导上进行化验，看看是不是能用。经过化验，证明一公斤煤灰就能顶一公斤低质煤的热量，完全可以同好煤掺合着烧。这一项就给工厂节约七千多吨好煤。厂内原来计划全年要花七万元卸车费，经过群众讨论，结果一个钱也不用花，用本厂的劳动力就可以完成卸煤任务。今年原来还计划需要厂外劳动力一万七千工帮助检修，经过群众精打细算，这个计划也被工人给免了，由厂子的工人自己干，可以节省费用十万元。石景山发电厂的职工并且积极学习杨树浦电厂的先进经验，降低煤耗，原计划耗为0.567公斤／度，一月份已经降到0.559公斤／度。如果全年平均能够达到这个水平，一年就可以节省七千多吨煤。
    最后再说说电力部北京修造厂的情况。北京修造厂的锅炉车间的技术组最近向各车间的技术组提出倡议：在不影响设计工作进度计划的条件下，挤出时间，利用旧料，在今年内组装一台两吨锅炉的燃煤机，他们把这个产品的设计和制造任务全包下来了。他们说，这样既可以受到体力劳动锻炼，又可增加生产操作经验，还可以为国家节约一万元。洋灰杆车间在二月五日也出现了日产八十三根洋灰杆的新纪录。从现在大伙的这股干劲看起来，工人们前些日子提出的“在洋灰杆产量和质量方面超过西安，赶上南京兄弟厂”的目标是完全能够达到的。
    各位代表：今年是我们国家第二个五年计划的头一年，是我国工农业生产大跃进的一年。这次大会是个促进全国生产大跃进的大会，我们回去以后，一定要掀起更高的社会主义生产热潮、我们农业机械厂一定要保证农业生产大跃进所需要的各项农业机械，我们发电厂一定要保证安全送电，降低煤耗，赶上先进指标，支援各个战线上的生产跃进，我们修造厂为了保证电厂的安全送电，一定要保证每个电厂的制作配件，我们要压短工时，降低成本，保证质量，恢复残旧设备的名牌出力。
    在第八次全国工人代表大会上，我们的党，工人阶级的政党，曾向我们提出了伟大的号召，在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国，我们万分兴奋地响应了这个号召。经过这次全国人民代表大会，我们的干劲更足了，我们一定要带动全体工人，为完成一九五八年的经济计划，使用浑身的力量，为更多、更快、更好、更省地建设我们的社会主义祖国，为提前实现十五年内赶上英国的目标奋斗。
