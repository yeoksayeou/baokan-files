Also a Scourge
    Shi Yuwu

    I recently came across an old book, and three bizarre and outlandish anecdotes captivated me:

    Xie Jingren's residence was clean and beautiful, but he always spat on the clothes of those around him. (Song Dynasty Zhao Yu's "Bin Tui Lu")

    Fu Jian's cousin, Lang, when he first crossed the Yangtze River,... Xie An often hosted banquets for him, and the hall was filled with courtiers. Lang wanted to boast about everything, even the tables, mats, pots, and seats. When he spat, he would order a young boy to kneel and open his mouth, spitting into it and then having him spit it out again. He would repeat this. Those present thought this was beyond their reach. (Book of Jin, Volume 114, Biography of Fu Lang)

    Yan Donglou's sputum was always caught by beautiful women with their mouths. As soon as he made a sound, a maid's mouth would cleverly reach out, calling it a "fragrant spittoon." (Qing Dynasty Yao Zhiyi's "Yuan Ming Lei Chao," citing Ming Dynasty Miscellaneous Records, Volume 17, Beauties)

    This is truly infuriating and unbearable, not only disgusting but also a loss of human dignity! To maintain the cleanliness and beauty of their residences, to boast, they actually spat on the clothes of servants and into the mouths of attendants and maids. What kind of heart did they have? Of course, the royal nobles of the feudal dynasties mostly indulged in extravagance and did everything, never regarding "inferiors" as human beings. But the behavior of Xie, Fu, and Yan, which was passed down to the later Shanghainese scoundrels, made even their own kind gasp and sigh, "beyond their reach."

    I am not here to settle old scores of class hatred with them, but it makes me think about the handling of phlegm.

    Foreigners used to think that we Chinese always "spit everywhere." In fact, they lack historical knowledge or deliberately distort the truth. Ancient Chinese medical literature often mentions the need to pay attention to hygiene habits. The "Qian Jin Yao Fang" says, "Always practice not spitting on the ground," which means to develop the habit of not spitting everywhere. In fact, as early as the beginning of the Common Era, we had records of using spittoons to collect phlegm. At that time, when the emperor went on巡幸 (xunxing - inspection tours), there were always attendants specifically holding spittoons. Small officials even considered it an "unparalleled honor" to get this job. The tribute from foreign countries, dependent states, and vassals often included spittoons. Even today, the Han Dynasty antiquities exhibition hall in the Palace Museum in Beijing still houses two "gilded" spittoons from about two thousand years ago, similar in style to the current ones but smaller, yet very exquisite.

    However, our ancestors certainly did not all "spit into spittoons." Those royal nobles later preferred to use servants as spittoons and treated the exquisite and delicate spittoons made of gold, jade, copper, crystal, and colored glaze as decorations to be admired. As for the common people, they could not even afford enough to eat and wear, and could not afford to pay attention to hygiene at all times. Gradually, the situation of "spitting everywhere" became common.

    After liberation, the Chinese people had the conditions to carry out planned and led sanitation campaigns. Especially recently, a patriotic movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene has surged like a magnificent wave to every corner of the country. Amidst the encouraging and proud news of the emergence of many areas and units free of the four pests, the situation of spitting everywhere has also decreased. Shanghai, Beijing, and other places also launched campaigns to discourage spitting everywhere last autumn and winter, so the situation has improved even more. But unfortunately, it is far from being eradicated.

    Spitting everywhere is clearly also a scourge. The harm is not in spitting but in spitting everywhere. As a result, it is not only unsightly but, more seriously, it spreads diseases. Scarlet fever, meningitis, pertussis, diphtheria, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other diseases are often spread from sputum. Among them, tuberculosis is the most serious. Last year, the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute of Dongdan District in Beijing examined more than 900 sputum samples on the street and found that 1% of the sputum contained tubercle bacilli. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital also took 35 sputum samples from the ground at a bus stop for testing and found that one sputum sample contained a large number of tubercle bacilli. The Dalian Anti-Tuberculosis Association tested 100 sputum samples and found that four sputum samples contained tubercle bacilli, with each sample containing millions of bacteria, and in some cases, tens of millions. According to scientists, a tuberculosis patient can cough up to 3 billion tubercle bacilli in one day. How shocking! But even more shocking is the bacteria's extremely strong resistance: it can survive for months or even years at 6 to 10 degrees Celsius. When floating in the air with dust, it can survive for eight to ten days. Even in direct sunlight, it can survive for half a day to a day.

    A healthy person does not spit phlegm. The trachea, bronchi, and lungs of healthy people constantly secrete mucus to moisten the mucous membrane, but this is not phlegm. Only when the respiratory tract is diseased will it secrete large amounts of mucus and need to be spat out, and this is phlegm. It can be said that where there is phlegm, there is disease. Perhaps he is not a patient with an infectious disease, but he may be a carrier, in short, he will spread the disease.

    How to deal with phlegm? It's easy indoors; spit into a spittoon, but the spittoon must be filled with some lime or water, and it must be washed and disinfected frequently. On the street and on public transport, it is impossible to set up spittoons everywhere, so you have to spit on your own handkerchief or paper, but after spitting, you should not use it for wiping, and it should be scalded with boiling water or burned. Some people spit on the ground and wipe it with their feet, thinking that this will destroy the evidence. In fact, bacteria cannot be wiped out; on the contrary, because the phlegm is wiped dry, it "emerges" faster, thus causing harm more quickly. Others hold it in and swallow it. This is also not good; the bacteria will still stir up trouble in the stomach.

    To eradicate this scourge, it seems that everyone needs to rise up and eliminate it. There are still situations like this: the spitter spits and doesn't care, while the bystanders turn a blind eye and do not interfere, so it seems that nothing has happened. I often do this. Seeing the scattered dirty things on the ground and in the corners of the walls, I also frown and feel disgusted. When someone coughs and shoots it straight out, I also feel impatient and annoyed. But unless the saliva splashes on me, lacking the patience to "let it dry," I am forced to protest, otherwise I will only give them a cold stare. Is it the legacy of "each person sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs," or the liberalism of "if it doesn't concern you, hang it high," or some other thought at work? I can't argue in detail, but anyway, they are all wrong. Let us all consciously and mutually supervise each other to eliminate this scourge, change customs and habits, and restore the original appearance of our working people who love cleanliness and hygiene!

    也是一害
    史御五
    偶翻旧书，三条光怪陆离的奇闻吸住了我：
    谢景仁居宇净丽，每唾必唾左右人衣。（宋赵与旹宾退录）
    苻坚从兄朗，初过江，……谢安常宴请之，朝士盈坐，并几褥壶席，朗每事欲夸之，唾则令小儿跪而张口，既唾而含出，顷复如之。坐者以为不及之远也。（晋书卷一百十四苻朗传）
    严东楼唾吐，皆美人以口承之。方发声婢口已巧就，谓之香唾盂。（清姚之驷元明类钞引明杂记卷十七美人条）
    这真令人怒发冲冠、气愤难忍，岂只感到恶心和失掉人的尊严而已！为了保持居室的整洁漂亮，为了夸耀，竟将痰吐在奴仆的衣裳上、侍童和侍女的嘴里，是何心肝？当然，封建王朝时代的王公贵族，大都穷奢极欲，无所不为，本来不把“下”人当人看待的。但像谢、苻、严这种一脉相传到后来的洋场恶少的行径的，就连他们的同类也不免瞠目咋舌，自叹“不及之远也”了。
    我不是要来同他们算阶级仇恨的旧账，只是由此想起了关于痰的处理。
    从前洋人以为我们中国人一向都是“随地吐痰”的。其实，是他们缺乏历史知识，或是故意歪曲。我国古代医学文献中常提到必须注意卫生习惯的话，“千金要方”中所说的“常习不唾地”，就是叫人养成不要随地吐痰的习惯。事实上早在公元初，我们就有了用痰盂收拾痰的记载。那时皇帝出巡，大都有专门捧着痰盂侍候的从者，小官们还以取得这个差使为“无上光荣”；外国、属国以及臣子的贡礼里面，也常常有痰盂一项，至今北京故宫博物院的汉代古物陈列室里，还存放着两个离现在约摸二千来年以前的“鎏金”痰盂，式样同现今的相仿而小些，却很精巧细致。
    不过，我们的祖先确也不曾个个做到“吐痰入盂”。那些王公贵族后来宁愿把奴仆当痰盂，而把那些金、玉、铜、水晶、琉璃做成的精致玲珑的痰盂当成摆设来赏玩。至于老百姓，吃、穿尚且不周，顾不到也不可能随时随地讲究卫生。渐渐地“随地吐痰”的情形也就普遍起来了。
    解放以后的中国人民，有了条件去进行有计划有领导的卫生运动。特别是近来，一个除四害、讲卫生的爱国运动，像壮阔的波澜，汹涌到了全国各个角落。在出现了许多个四无地区、单位的令人振奋自豪的消息声中，随地吐痰的情形也已经随着减少了。上海、北京等地去年秋冬还曾展开过劝止随地吐痰的运动，所以情形更为好转。但可惜还远远没有绝迹。
    随地吐痰分明也是一害。它害不在吐痰而害在随地。随地的结果，不仅有碍观瞻，更严重的是传染疾病。猩红热、脑膜炎、百日咳、白喉、肺炎、肺结核等病，很多是从痰里传染开去的。其中尤以结核病最厉害。去年，北京东单区结核病防治所检查过街上九百多口痰，发现1％的痰里有结核菌；上海防痨医院也曾在一个公共汽车站的地上取了三十五口痰去化验，发现有口痰里含有大量结核菌；旅大市防痨协会化验的一百口痰里，有四口痰有结核菌，每口含菌量少者几百万，多者几千万。据科学家计算，一个肺结核患者一天所吐的痰，可以含到三十亿个结核杆菌。多么惊心动魄！然而更其惊人的是细菌的抵抗力极强：在摄氏六到十度时可以活数月甚至数年之久，随着灰尘浮游在空中的时候可以活八到十日，就是在阳光直射下，也还能活半天到一天。
    一个健康的人是不吐痰的。健康人的气管、支气管和肺脏，平时也不断分泌出一些黏液来，用以润湿黏膜，但这不是痰。只有当呼吸道有病时，才大量分泌黏液，并要一吐为快，这才是痰。可以说，有痰就有病。也许他不是传染病患者，却可能是带菌者，总之是会传染疾病。
    怎么处理痰呢？在屋里好办，吐痰入盂便了，但痰盂里必须放些石灰或清水，要勤洗勤消毒。在街上，公共车辆上，不可能广设痰盂，只得吐在自己的手帕或纸上，但吐后不可再作揩拭用，应当用开水烫洗或烧掉。有人随地吐了之后用脚一擦，以为这就消尸灭迹了。其实，细菌是擦不死的，反倒因着痰被擦干而更快“脱颖而出”，因而危害也更快。又有人忍住不吐，往肚里咽。这也不妙，病菌到肚里照样会兴风作浪。
    要使这一害绝迹，似乎还有待于人人起而歼之。现在多少还有这样的情况：吐者自吐，毫不在乎，而旁人熟视无睹，不加干涉，于是仿佛相安无事。我就常如此。看到地上、墙角那星星点点的脏东西，也绉眉恶心；遇到别人咳的一声直射出去，也急躁厌烦。但除非唾沫星子溅到了自己身上，缺乏“唾面自干”的忍耐力，才逼不得已提出抗议，否则是至多白眼相加而已。究竟是“各人自扫门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜”的遗风呢，还是“事不关己，高高挂起”的自由主义呢，还是别的什么思想在作祟？我不及细辩，反正都不对。让我们大家自觉而又相互督促地一起来消灭这一害，移风易俗，还我们劳动人民爱好清洁卫生的本来面目！
