Who to Reach Out To?
Jiang Zhi Shui

In government offices, enterprises, and factories, a "reliance on the organization" mentality was once popular. Some people, facing difficulties in life for various reasons, which they might well be able to overcome themselves, thought: No need to rush, the organization will take care of it anyway. Surely the organization won't let me starve?

Relying on the organization is not wrong in itself. Revolutionary organizations will always provide spiritual encouragement and material assistance to comrades facing various difficulties, based on the specific circumstances. This is one of the clear proofs of our social system's superiority over the old society. However, those who say such things have their own views. Their so-called "reliance on the organization" is merely "dependence on the organization," which is to say, simply reaching out to the organization for things. There are probably quite a few people who hold this view; otherwise, why would there be so many unreasonable reasons among those applying for subsidies!

The market for this "reliance on the organization" is not large, but it does have some supporters, namely some well-meaning but bureaucratic leaders. When they encounter employee welfare issues, they spend money lavishly; when they encounter applications for hardship subsidies, they approve them all without exception. As a result, more and more people are reaching out to the organization for things, and backward ideas are also beginning to surface.

For example, some people demand more housing and more furniture; some demand that the organization pay for their water and electricity bills; some demand that the public pay for their baths and haircuts; and even when they break the windows of public dormitories themselves, they ask the public to replace them. If it's late in coming, they even throw tantrums at the general affairs department. In this way, how can the welfare expenses of government offices not increase year by year, and how can selfish and unreasonable demands not be made more and more frequently!

This kind of person is especially common among young workers and young cadres. The young workers in the factory, even though they take dozens of yuan each month, still complain that it's not enough to spend, and even though they receive a set of work clothes each year, they still complain that it's not enough. The lives of the cadres in government offices are already very comfortable, but if there is any slight inconvenience, they still shout and yell, complaining that this is not good and that is not good. They think that the cause that revolutionary predecessors left to them is only for enjoyment, only to reach out and endlessly demand things from the organization! Demand! Demand!

In this way, the tenacious spirit of many young people to actively overcome difficulties is worn away; the revolutionary drive to forge ahead is worn away, and people's thinking also begins to become rigid. All they see are personal and immediate trivial matters of life, and their revolutionary consciousness and lofty ideals disappear.

Happily, this evil trend is currently being reversed. The soaring ambition and will of hundreds of millions of people, riding the wind and waves and advancing bravely, are sweeping away the dust from these people, making them sober up.

After thorough airing of views, the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant calculated their accounts carefully and voluntarily canceled housing allowances, haircut allowances, and changed many unreasonable welfare benefits such as free medical treatment for family members. The Xiangjiang Machine Factory, by encouraging the masses to build their own houses and other methods, used the wisdom and strength of the masses to solve the long-standing housing shortage. Recently, more and more reports have appeared in the newspapers about workers in various places voluntarily requesting the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations. This master-like attitude of the masses, their innovative power, and their spirit full of unlimited hope and confidence are forming a new trend. This force cannot be stopped by anyone. It is impacting those who only reach out and demand, telling them that difficulties may exist, but they can no longer wait passively and dependently. They cannot let their outstretched hands only reach out to demand, but must go to create and strive. They must always believe in their own strength. As long as they muster revolutionary drive, no difficulty is insurmountable, and nothing cannot be obtained with our waving hands.

This force is also impacting those "caring for the lives of workers" but simply bestowing good-hearted leaders, letting them understand that they must believe in the majority of the masses, and that they must believe that the masses can use their own wisdom and strength to solve their temporary difficulties.

Oppose reaching out to the state for things! Let outstretched hands demand from difficulties, demand from backwardness, demand from nature!

    伸手向谁要？
    江之水
    在机关企业和厂矿里，曾经流行过一种“依靠组织论”，有人因为种种原因，生活上发生点困难，自己未必不能克服解决，但，他们却以为：甭着急，反正有组织照顾，组织上还能让我挨饿吗？
    依靠组织本不算错，革命组织对发生了各种困难的同志，总会根据情况给以精神的鼓舞和物质上的帮助的。这也是我们的社会制度之所以优异于旧社会的明证之一。但是说那种话的人，却另有自己的看法，他们所谓“依靠组织”，只是“依赖组织”，也就是伸手向组织上要而已。持这种观点的人恐怕不少，否则申请补助的人当中，何以有那么多不成理由的理由呢！
    这种“依靠组织论”的市场并不大，但是也有一些支持者，那就是一些发善心的官僚主义领导者。他们一遇到职工福利问题，就是大把地花钱；一遇到申请困难补助，就一律批准。结果，伸手向组织上要的人也越来越多了，落后思想也跟着露了头。
    例如有的人要求多住房子，多用家具；有的要求水电费由组织上负担；有的要求洗澡、理发公家出钱，甚至自己打碎了公家宿舍的玻璃，也让公家来换，来得迟了，还要向总务部门大发脾气。这样，机关福利开支怎能不一年年地增加，自私自利的不合理的要求怎么不会越提越多呢！
    在青年职工和青年干部中，这种人尤其多。工厂的青工，每月拿了几十元钱还嚷不够花，每年领了一套工服也嫌不够。机关干部的生活本来很优裕了，如稍有不周，也还大嚷大叫，这也不好，那也不好。他们以为革命前辈留给他们的事业只是享受，只是伸出手来无休止地向组织上索取，要！要！
    不少青年人积极克服困难的坚毅精神就这样消磨掉了；勇往直前的革命干劲消磨掉了，人的思想也开始僵化，睁眼看到的只是个人眼前的生活琐事，革命的自觉性和远大的理想都不见了。
    可喜的是，目前这股歪风正在扭转，亿万人民乘风破浪、奋勇跃进的雄心和意志，正在扫荡着这些人身上的灰尘，让他们清醒起来。
    石景山发电厂工人，经过大鸣大放，自己算细账，自动取消了住房津贴、理发津贴，改变家属治病不收费等好多不合理的福利待遇。湘江机器厂以鼓励群众自建住宅等方式，运用群众自己的智慧和力量，解决了长期解决不了的缺房困难。近来报上登的各地职工自动要求改革不合理规章制度的也越来越多，群众的这种主人翁的态度，革新的力量和充满无限希望、自信的精神，正在形成一股新的潮流。这力量是任何人所阻挡不了的，它冲击着那些光伸手要的人们，告诉他们，困难也许是有的，但不能再那样消极等待、依赖了，不能让伸出的手只是去要，而是要去创造，去争取。要永远相信自己的力量，只要鼓起革命干劲，没有什么困难是不可克服的，没有什么东西是不可以用我们挥动的双手所获取得的。
    这股力量也冲击着那些“关心职工生活”而单纯施予的好心的领导者，让他们明白，要相信群众中的多数，要相信群众是可以用自己的智慧和力量解决自己暂时的困难的。
    反对伸手向国家要！让伸出的双手向困难索取，向落后索取，向大自然索取！
