　　The Question of Writing Reform and the Rise and Fall of Calligraphy
　　Shen Yinmo
　　Writing reform is being carried out from the perspective of the interests of 600 million people and is proceeding step by step following the inevitable laws of the historical process of writing evolution. Therefore, it is easily accepted by the people. Although it is not specifically intended for the future of calligraphers, the act of writing is undoubtedly included. Since writing is involved, there must be a distinction between beauty and ugliness. Who wouldn't want to write strokes more beautifully? This will naturally involve calligraphy. Although the writing has changed, it does not hinder the study of calligraphy in the slightest. Even from a purely calligraphic point of view, its rise and fall cannot be determined by the likes and dislikes of a few people. If it really gets to the point where 600 million people ignore it, no one can prevent it from being abandoned. Otherwise, as long as someone hasn't forgotten it, and regardless of whether they are old or young, intellectuals or working people, feel a little bit of its loveliness, then even if you are unwilling to see it flourish, you can't stop it. This principle is self-evident, and I don't think anyone will object. Even when further writing reform comes—specifically, when pinyinization is implemented—Chinese characters may still exist because they will still have special uses, but they will not be used by the general public, but only by professionals.

　　Some people say that after simplification, the writing looks ungainly. This is influenced by the Qing Dynasty's rules against writing broken-style characters, thinking that broken-style characters are not suitable for elegant occasions. In fact, this only became strict after the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty; there were no such restrictions before. We may as well cite a few examples from past calligraphers. Every time the script changed, there was a calligrapher who wrote the new script. For example, when Great Seal script changed to Small Seal script, there was the Small Seal script calligrapher Li Si. When Small Seal script changed to Clerical script and was simplified into Zhangcao script, there were many famous Han stele calligraphers whose works still exist today, the most famous of whom were Cai Yong, Liang Hu, and Zhong Yao; grass script calligraphers included Zhang Zhi and Suo Jing. By the time of running script and regular script, the most famous were Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, all of whom were calligraphers of the new script. None of them disparaged the new script. Only those who, like Han Yu, were fond of antiquity would say that "Xizhi's vulgar script caters to charm," but this was only said to elevate the Stone Drum Inscriptions and is not a valid assessment. Looking at the Six Dynasties stone carvings, many famous steles contain broken-style characters, and we have not seen them express any dissatisfaction, only scholars like Yan Zhitui criticized them.

　　Today's calligraphers must serve the people. If they are unwilling to write the new script that 600 million people want to use, that is very wrong. As for some people saying that some characters are not good-looking or easy to write after simplification, that is only because they are not used to them. Are all the old characters good-looking and easy to write? For example, the characters "孑," "孓," "凸," and "凹" are, in my opinion, difficult to write beautifully.

　　Whether my views are correct or not naturally needs everyone's criticism. If we draw a conclusion based on the reasons I have stated above, it is that writing reform does not hinder the study of calligraphy, and simplified characters can also be written beautifully. As for the fear that Chinese characters will be abandoned, this is akin to杞人忧天 [the man of Qi fearing the sky would fall], which is unnecessary. Moreover, Premier Zhou recently spoke very clearly and thoroughly about the fate of Chinese characters in his report on the current tasks of writing reform, so you can rest assured.

　　文字改革与书法兴废问题
　　沈尹默
    文字改革是从六亿人民利益着眼来进行工作的，而且是遵循着文字演进的历史过程必然的规律来次第进行的。所以它很容易被人民接受，这固然没有专为书法家前途打算，而书写一事，无疑地是包括在内，既然要写，就不能没有美丑之分，点画能写得美观些，谁不愿意？这样一来，自然而然地会牵涉到书法上面去。文字虽然改变了，却与书法的研究丝毫没有妨碍。就是单从书法观点来说，它的兴废问题，也不是凭少数几个人的爱憎所能决定的，若真到了六亿人民都不去理睬它的时候，你要想它不至于废弃，那是谁也办不到的事；不然的话，只要有人没有忘记它，而且不问是老是少，是知识分子，是劳动人民，都略有几分觉得它的可爱，那你就是万分不愿意它兴盛起来，也是无法办到的。这种道理，不辩自明，我想不会有人提出异议。就是到了进一步文字改革的时候——明显地说，到了实行拼音化的时候，方块汉字，还有存在的可能，因为还有它的特别用场，不过是不归一般人来使用，而是只供专业的人来使用罢了。
    有人说文字简化后，写起来就不像样，这是受了以前不许写破体字的清规戒律的影响，以为破体字是不足登大雅之堂的。其实，这是到了清代乾隆以后，才严格起来的，以前是没有这种限制的。不妨试将历代书家实例举几个来看，每一次字体改易，必有写新体字的书家出现。如大篆变为小篆，就有一位小篆书家李斯。小篆变为隶书，又简化成章草，就有了现在尚存在的许多有名汉碑的书家，其中最有名的，如蔡邕、梁鹄、锺?；草书家有张芝、索靖等人。到了行楷时代，最有名的，要算锺、王，他们无一不是新体字的书家，他们没有一个人菲薄过新体字，只有像韩退之那样好古之士，才说过“羲之俗书趁姿媚”，但这也不过为作文字抬高石鼓文才这样说罢了，本不足为定评。再就六朝碑刻来看，好多名碑中，破体字就不少，不曾看见他们有不满意的说法，也只有学者们如颜之推才加以讥诮。
    今天的书家必须为人民服务，若果不愿意写六亿人民所要用的新体字，那是大不应该的。至于有人说，简化后有些字，既不好看，又不好写，那只是不大习惯的缘故，难道旧体字中个个都是好看好写的吗？如“孑”“孓”、“凸”“凹”等字，我觉得写起来就很难得好看。
    我的看法对不对，自然还要大家批评，如果照我上边所说的理由来下一个结论，就是：文字改革与书法研究，并无妨碍，简化了的字体，也有写得好看的可能。至于恐怕要把汉字废弃，这有类于杞人忧天，大可不必，何况最近周总理在当前文字改革的任务报告中，关于汉字的命运，已经说得很明白透彻，尽可放心。
