　　Four Advantages of Hydraulic Mining
    Fewer Accidents, Higher Efficiency, Less Timber, Lower Costs
    Representative Guo Qingsi Introduces the Experience of Pingxiang Coal Mine
    I fully agree with the work reports of Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang.
    I am a coal cutter from Pingxiang Coal Mine. Now, I will report to the conference on the issue of hydraulic mining in Pingxiang Coal Mine. In the second half of 1956, our mine sent people to the Soviet Union to study hydraulic mining methods. This mining method is also the most advanced in the Soviet Union and Poland. After the people who studied returned to the mine from the Soviet Union, the leaders of our mine attached great importance to it and organized personnel to conduct research and experiments. After more than five months, the experiment was finally successful. The mine designated a hydraulic mining area and has been in normal production since the second half of last year.
    Hydraulic mining uses high-pressure water of sixty atmospheres to mine coal. In general mines, water is not lacking. Using underground water to mine and transport coal can also reduce our physical labor and increase labor productivity by more than double. This points out a new path for improving mine production and coal mining technology.
    There are many benefits to using hydraulic mining. In summary, the main points are as follows:
    First, it can reduce accidents and ensure safe production. Using jackhammers, hand picks, and coal cutting machines for mining produces a lot of coal dust and gas; carelessness can easily lead to coal falls, rock falls, and roof collapses. Since we started using hydraulic mining in our mine, coal dust and gas have been greatly reduced. People stand in the roadway holding water guns and spraying the working face, which is far away from the coal falling point, thus avoiding accidents such as coal falls, rock falls, and roof collapses.
    Second, production efficiency is particularly high. One water gun only requires one person to operate and can mine 70 tons of coal per hour, which is more than double the mining efficiency of coal cutting machines.
    Third, it can save pit timber. Under normal circumstances, one thousand tons of coal requires an average of fifteen cubic meters of pit timber, and the consumption of pit timber is very large. Therefore, some people say, "Coal is exchanged for wood." Using hydraulic mining, one thousand tons of coal only requires three point eight cubic meters of pit timber, saving three-quarters compared to other mining methods.
    Fourth, it can reduce coal mining costs. Using jackhammers and hand picks for coal mining costs six or seven yuan per ton. Using coal cutting machines costs two yuan and thirty-six cents per ton. Using hydraulic mining, it only costs one yuan and fifty-nine cents per ton. The cost per ton of coal is more than 75% lower than using jackhammers and hand picks, and 32.6% lower than using coal cutting machines.
    Using hydraulic mining improves production conditions and reduces the labor intensity of workers, which is beneficial to the health of workers. Previously, some people called us coal miners "coal blacks" or "charcoal ancients." Now we have all become water gun, water pump, coal cutting machine, and sieve drivers, and are no longer "coal blacks" or "charcoal ancients."
    Now, our Pingxiang Coal Mine has mastered this advanced mining technology. In half a year of production practice, it has been proven that hydraulic mining will play an important role in reducing accidents, ensuring safe production, saving pit timber, increasing production, reducing costs, and accelerating the development of China's coal industry.
    Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, through various movements and studies, the class consciousness of the vast number of employees in our Pingxiang Coal Mine has greatly improved. Everyone has been inspired with revolutionary enthusiasm, and production is developing at a very fast pace. The total coal output increased from 537,000 tons in 1952 to 1,840,000 tons in 1957, an increase of two and a half times compared to 1952, overfulfilling the first five-year plan. Although we have made great achievements, we will never be complacent or arrogant. In the future, we must humbly learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and fraternal coal mines, work hard to produce, and make persistent efforts to complete and overfulfill the coal production plan for 1958.
    Please criticize and correct whether the above speech is appropriate.

　　水力采煤四大优点
    事故少、效率高、坑木省、成本低
    郭清泗代表介绍萍乡煤矿的经验
    我完全同意李副总理、薄副总理、彭真副委员长、吴玉章主任的各项工作报告。
    我是萍乡煤矿的一个割煤司机，现在我将萍乡煤矿使用水力采煤的问题，向大会作一汇报。在一九五六年下半年，我们矿上派人到苏联去学习水力采煤的方法。这种采煤方法，在苏联和波兰也是最先进的。学习的人从苏联回到矿上以后，我们矿的领导非常重视，组织人员进行研究和试验，经过五个多月，终于试验成功了。矿上划分了水力采煤区，从去年下半年起，已经做到了正常生产。
    水力采煤是用六十个大气压的高压水来采煤。在一般的矿井下，水是不缺的。利用井下的水采煤、运煤，也可以减轻我们的体力劳动，而且使劳动生产率提高一倍以上，这对于改进矿井的生产和采煤技术，指出了新的门路。
    用水力采煤好处是很多的，总括起来说，主要有以下几点：
    第一，可以减少事故，安全生产。使用风镐、手镐和割煤机等采煤，煤灰和瓦斯很多；一不小心就容易发生落煤、落石、冒顶的事故。我们矿上自使用水力采煤以来，煤灰和瓦斯大大减少。人在巷道中撑着水枪望工作面冲射，离落煤地点很远，就可避免落煤、落石、冒顶的事故。
    第二，生产效率特别高。一台水枪只要一个人操作，一小时可以采煤七十吨。比割煤机的采煤效率提高了一倍以上。
    第三，可以节省坑木。一般情况，一千吨煤，平均要十五立方公尺的坑木，坑木的消耗量是很大的，所以有人说，“煤是用木材换出来的”。使用水力采煤，一千吨煤只要三点八立方公尺的坑木，比其他采煤方法，节省四分之三。
    第四，可以降低采煤成本。用风镐、手镐采煤，每吨的成本要六、七元钱，用割煤机采煤，每吨的成本要两元三角六分，使用水力采煤，一吨只要一元五角九分，每一吨煤的成本较风镐手降低百分之七十五以上，较割煤机降低百分之三十二点六。
    使用水力采煤，改善了生产条件，工人的劳动强度减轻了，这就有利于工人的身体健康。以前有人把我们煤矿工人叫作“煤黑子”或“炭古老”，现在我们都成为水枪、水泵、割煤机和筛子司机，不再是“煤黑子”、“炭古老”了。
    现在，我们萍乡煤矿已经掌握了这种先进的采煤技术，在半年的生产实践中，已证明用水力采煤对于减少事故，保证安全生产、节省坑木、提高产量、降低成本和加速我国煤炭工业发展，将起着重要的作用。
    我们萍乡煤矿在党和毛主席的领导下，经过各种运动和学习，广大职工的阶级觉悟有了很大的提高。大家都鼓起了革命干劲，生产是以很快的速度向前发展。煤的总产量从一九五二年的五十三万七千吨，到一九五七年增长到一百八十四万吨，比一九五二年增加了两倍半，超额完成了第一个五年计划。我们虽然取得很大成就，但决不自满和不骄傲。在今后更要虚心学习苏联和兄弟煤矿的先进经验，努力生产，再接再厉，为完成和超额完成一九五八年的煤炭生产计划而奋斗。
    以上的发言，是否妥当，请代表们批评指正。
