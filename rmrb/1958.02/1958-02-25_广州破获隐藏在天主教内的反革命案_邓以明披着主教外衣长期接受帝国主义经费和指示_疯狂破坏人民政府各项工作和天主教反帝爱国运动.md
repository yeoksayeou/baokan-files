Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 24th: The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, based on tip-offs and after a long period of investigation, recently cracked the Deng Yiming counter-revolutionary case, which was concealed within the Catholic Diocese of Guangzhou. With the approval of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate, Deng Yiming was arrested according to law on the 5th; Yan Degeng, an accomplice in the same case, was also arrested at the same time. These two counter-revolutionaries are currently being interrogated by relevant departments.

The counter-revolutionary Deng Yiming, wearing a religious cloak, has for many years usurped the position of Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Guangzhou. Another counter-revolutionary, Yan Degeng, is a priest of the Sacred Heart Cathedral (Shishi Catholic Church) and also serves as the Bishop's secretary. Evidence from tip-offs from the masses and in previous cases cracking down on imperialist special agents proves that Deng Yiming has been illegally accepting funds from imperialism since liberation to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, implement reactionary instructions from the Vatican, cover up imperialist activities of dispatching special agents to New China, and collude with the spy Fu Shoukang to steal intelligence. Between 1951 and 1953, Deng Yiming received HK$90,000 from the Vatican for reactionary activities, and another 30,000 from American imperialists. He also directly received a portion of the funds from the imperialist Ma Liang, who was expelled from our country. After obtaining a large amount of funds from imperialism, Deng Yiming used them to actively support and aid domestic counter-revolutionary activities and counter-revolutionaries hidden within Catholicism. In February 1955, Deng Yiming also transferred RMB 2,135 yuan to Huang Keren (already arrested), a counter-revolutionary lurking in the Shantou Catholic Church, on behalf of the foreign spy Shi Weide. In 1955, Deng Yiming also sent 1,970 yuan to the Wan Cizhang counter-revolutionary group (already cracked) hiding in the Hengyang Catholic Church in Hunan Province.

While accepting money from imperialism, Deng Yiming also accepted reactionary political orders from imperialism. Over the years, among the reactionary instructions and documents Deng Yiming received from overseas imperialist elements were the Vatican's 1954 instructions inciting Chinese Catholics to be hostile to the Communist Party and oppose the People's Government, "Pope Pius XII's letter to the Archbishops, Bishops and other heads of Dioceses and Priests and Faithful of the Apostolic See in China," and the reactionary instructions passed by the Rome International Fides News Agency on July 13, 1957, to undermine the Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference, etc. After receiving these reactionary instructions, Deng Yiming immediately communicated them to reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements in Catholic churches in various places. For example, he once gave the reactionary instructions issued by the Vatican in 1954 to Wang Linuo, a counter-revolutionary lurking in the Catholic Church in Jiangmen City, and Huang Keren of the Catholic Church in Shantou City, and instructed them to carry out reactionary activities.

Deng Yiming also actively participated in the criminal activities of counter-revolutionaries dispatched from overseas to New China to carry out sabotage, according to the instructions of imperialist elements. Deng Yiming, under the command of Fu Shoukang, an imperialist spy expelled from our country, jointly organized a smuggling ring in Guangzhou, specializing in transporting counter-revolutionaries and landlord elements within Catholicism across the border. In 1952, Fu Shoukang conspired with Deng Yiming to use HK$3,000 to smuggle a reactionary element named Lin Yifen out of the country through the smuggler Chen Shaoguang; at the same time, he also smuggled the counter-revolutionary Zhao Yan to Hong Kong. In early 1953, after Wu Naiyuan and Huang Chao, reactionary elements in the Shanghai Catholic Church, arrived in Guangzhou, they were also smuggled across the border with the help of Fu Shoukang and Deng Yiming; on the eve of their departure, Deng Yiming also "blessed" these two reactionary elements, wishing them success in their smuggling. When Fu Shoukang was stealing intelligence and carrying out sabotage activities in Guangzhou, Deng Yiming was an active participant. He handed over documents collected through the church to Fu Shoukang for review and identification, and personally sent people to investigate the situation of the American spy Ford, who was arrested in our country, for Fu Shoukang.

Deng Yiming also colluded with the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group hidden in the Catholic Church, which was cracked in Shanghai in December 1955, in an attempt to gather counter-revolutionaries hidden in Catholic churches across the country and expand sabotage activities. As early as 1951, Deng Yiming personally went to Shanghai to contact the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group to discuss how to unite counter-revolutionaries in Catholic dioceses across the country to cope with the new situation in China. At the initiative of Deng Yiming and with the support of Gong Pinmei, a meeting was held, attended by Deng Yiming, Gong Pinmei, Zhou Jishi, a reactionary element in the Catholic Church in Jiangxi Province, and an imperialist element lurking in Shanghai. During his stay in Shanghai, Deng Yiming also visited the imperialist spy Ge Shouping and secretly discussed matters with this imperialist element who had been engaged in espionage activities in our country for many years. The issues they discussed included opposing the Catholic Church's anti-imperialist patriotic movement, the patriotic covenant should not include supporting the Communist Party, the Legion of Mary should not be recognized as a reactionary organization, and the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement should not be led within Catholicism, etc. After Deng Yiming returned from Shanghai, he launched a frenzied attack on and sabotaged the anti-imperialist patriotic movement in various churches in Guangzhou. In May 1953, Deng Yiming again sent Tan Tiande and others, counter-revolutionaries in the Guangzhou Catholic Church, to Shanghai under the guise of "pilgrimage" to learn the counter-revolutionary activity experience of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group.

In order to conspire to expand sabotage activities, Deng Yiming also personally contacted Huang Huaquan, a counter-revolutionary in Shanghai, in early 1952, exchanging information on Sino-Soviet friendly activities and the Catholic Patriotic Movement in the two places. Huang Huaquan sent Deng Yiming information on the activities of imperialist elements in the Shanghai Catholic Church and the People's Government's organization of Catholic priests and monks to study, in order to supply overseas imperialist elements. In 1954, Deng Yiming also contacted the Wan Cizhang counter-revolutionary group hiding in the Hengyang Catholic Church in Hunan Province, supplying funds to this counter-revolutionary group; Wan Cizhang also reported to Deng Yiming on the local Catholic Church's anti-imperialist patriotic movement. In January 1955, Deng Yiming also contacted counter-revolutionaries in the Catholic Church in Xinxiang, Henan, and immediately appointed the reactionary element Zhang Guozhen to establish a liaison point in Guangzhou to engage in secret money transfer activities. In February 1955, Huang Keren, a counter-revolutionary lurking in the Catholic Church in Shantou, arrived in Guangzhou and was "treated courteously" by Deng Yiming. Deng Yiming spent two days with Huang Keren exchanging information on the Catholic Patriotic Movement in the two places and discussing how to continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in various churches after the imperialist Li Peili was expelled from our country. Huang Keren proposed to gather leaders of dioceses to discuss, while Deng Yiming proposed that "although Li Peili is not in China, there are still people in Hong Kong who can be asked for instructions." Deng Yiming also introduced Huang Keren to contact the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group in Shanghai, and set up a contact point for Huang Keren in Guangzhou to exchange information with various code names.

Deng Yiming was extremely hostile to all political movements. During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, young Catholics signed up to join the Volunteer Army, and Deng Yiming personally stopped them. During the land reform, he actively incited Catholics to oppose land reform, support landlords, and insult peasants and land reform work cadres. Deng Yiming also slandered the Five-Anti Movement and forbade Catholics from participating in this movement.

Deng Yiming's hostility towards the People's Government and refusal to implement government decrees was particularly evident when the Guangzhou Military Control Commission announced the ban on the reactionary "Legion of Mary" organization in 1953. At that time, Deng Yiming convened a meeting to study countermeasures for sabotage, instructing "Legion of Mary" members not to register with the People's Government, and those who had withdrawn from the "Legion of Mary" should declare to the People's Government that they were revoking their registration. He also used divine power to strike and threaten some people who had already registered to withdraw from the "Legion of Mary," and incited "Legion of Mary" members to be "braver"; he encouraged and took care of some elements who resisted government decrees.

During the 1955 movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group was cracked in Shanghai. After learning about this, Deng Yiming immediately burned and dispersed reactionary documents, photos, letters and the Kuomintang party flag related to this counter-revolutionary group, which had been secretly preserved for a long time. On the other hand, he also spread the atmosphere of "religious persecution" everywhere among the clergy, threatening them to "prepare to go to jail." When Zeng Qinglin, a counter-revolutionary in the Catholic Church, was arrested according to law, Deng Yiming said that Zeng Qinglin was a "model of the church" and a "standard youth," wantonly slandering the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Until last year, Deng Yiming also organized some people in the Catholic Church to appeal separately, attempting to reverse the cases of Tan Tiande and other counter-revolutionaries in custody. When the rectification movement began, Deng Yiming again arranged and instigated some clergy to publicly attack the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries at the forum for airing views and demanded the release of counter-revolutionaries in custody.

Deng Yiming tried his best to sabotage the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics and used religious divine power to attack patriotic Catholics. As early as February 1951, he studied plans to sabotage the patriotic movement within the Catholic Church with imperialist elements Ma Liang, Yan Yiqun, and others lurking in the Catholic Church. After he assumed the position of bishop, he first forced the clergy to withdraw from the patriotic movement.

After Deng Yiming contacted the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group in Shanghai, he more actively planned for the counter-revolutionary Tan Tiande and others to frantically attack the anti-imperialist patriotic movement in various churches, slandering and attacking patriotic activists among the Catholics, and wooing and coercing Catholics to withdraw from the patriotic movement. In May 1953, he sent the counter-revolutionary Tan Tiande to Shanghai to learn the counter-revolutionary experience of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary group. After Tan returned, he organized a so-called "discipline team" to attack and sabotage patriotic activists by means of rumors, insults, discrimination, and disruptions. At the same time, he monitored patriotic Catholics and forbade them from entering the church to participate in religious life. Deng Yiming first announced to the Catholics in the Sacred Heart Cathedral that "all Catholics are not allowed to participate in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, and are not allowed to sign the indictment meeting to expel foreign priests (imperialist elements)." After the preparatory committee for the patriotic association was established by Catholics in Guangzhou, Deng Yiming said that the patriotic association was "harming the church," and members of the patriotic association should be "rejected," otherwise they would be "punished." According to preliminary statistics, more than 280 patriotic Catholics suffered his attacks for participating in the indictment of imperialist elements' crimes, withdrawing from the reactionary "Legion of Mary" organization, participating in the patriotic association, or enthusiastically participating in neighborhood work. Even the family members of patriotic Catholics were said by Deng Yiming to be "guilty" and should be "punished." A child Catholic was slapped and had his ears twisted for joining the Young Pioneers, and even his red scarf was torn off. In Deng Yiming's "Bishop's Mansion" "Children's Catechism Class," there was even a reactionary behavior of "catching red-necked ghosts" (referring to catching patriotic Catholics). Deng Yiming also strictly controlled and deceived the general clergy, interfering with their patriotic freedom. On August 17, 1956, Deng Yiming stipulated many restrictions for the clergy, hindering them from participating in patriotic activities. In 1956, some clergy were elected as people's representatives, and Deng Yiming severely criticized them, saying that this violated the "canon," "set a bad example in the church," and said that priests should not participate in social public activities without the approval of higher authorities, otherwise they would be opposing the church and disobeying the "Pope's orders." On December 8, 1955, Deng Yiming instructed the clergy to resist participating in the mass rally to eliminate counter-revolutionaries; in May 1956, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee Religious Affairs Office organized Catholic clergy to visit the "Exhibition of Evidence of Crimes of Counter-Revolutionaries Hidden in the Church," and Deng Yiming even obstructed it. Deng Yiming also forbade the clergy from reading Catholic patriotic books and magazines such as "Xinge" and "Guangchang." He also interfered with and attacked the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics in other regions.

Although Deng Yiming's crimes of undermining the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Catholics and undermining the interests of the people of the motherland were not completely exposed in the past, some of his evil activities were so rampant that they aroused public anger among some patriotic Catholics. Someone reported him to the public security organs. Since November of last year, some Catholic masses have held a series of gatherings to expose and accuse Deng Yiming.

    广州破获隐藏在天主教内的反革命案
    邓以明披着主教外衣长期接受帝国主义经费和指示
    疯狂破坏人民政府各项工作和天主教反帝爱国运动
    新华社广州24日电　广州市公安局根据检举材料，经过长期侦察，最近破获了暗藏在天主教广州教区内的邓以明反革命案。经过广州市人民检察院的批准，已经在5日依法逮捕了邓以明；同案犯颜德耕也同时被捕。这两个反革命分子现在正由有关部门进行审讯中。
    披着宗教外衣的反革命分子邓以明，多年来窃据着天主教广州教区主教的职位。另一个反革命分子颜德耕是石室天主堂的神甫，并兼任主教秘书。从人民群众的检举以及在历次破获帝国主义特务间谍案件中得到的证据证明，邓以明自解放后就一直非法接受帝国主义提供他进行反革命活动的经费，执行梵蒂冈的反动指示，掩护帝国主义向新中国派遣特务间谍分子的活动，并勾结间谍分子福寿康窃探情报。在1951到1953年间，邓以明从梵蒂冈接受的用来进行反动活动的经费就有港币九万元，另外由美帝国主义分子汇来的有三万元，他还直接从被我国驱逐出境的帝国主义分子马良那里取来了一部分经费。邓以明取得帝国主义供给的大量经费后，就用来积极支持和接济国内的反革命活动和隐藏在天主教内的反革命分子。1955年2月，邓以明还替国外的间谍诗卫德转交人民币二千一百三十五元给潜伏在汕头天主教会内的反革命分子黄克仁（已捕）；1955年邓以明又转寄一千九百七十元给潜藏在湖南省衡阳市天主教会内的万次章反革命集团（已破获）。
    邓以明一面接受帝国主义的金钱，一面接受帝国主义的反动政治命令。几年来，在邓以明接受海外帝国主义分子的反动指示、文件中，就有梵蒂冈在1954年发出的煽动中国天主教徒敌视共产党、反对人民政府的指示“教宗庇护第十二世致书中国总主教、主教和其余各教区首长并司铎及服膺宗座信友”、1957年7月13日梵蒂冈通过的罗马国际费特通讯社发表的破坏中国天主教代表会议的反动指示等等。邓以明接到这些反动指示后，即传达给各地天主教会内的反动分子和反革命分子。例如，他曾经拿1954年梵蒂冈发出的反动指示给潜藏在江门市天主教会内的反革命分子王理诺和汕头市天主教会的黄克仁等传阅，并指示他们进行反动活动。
    邓以明还根据帝国主义分子的指示，积极参与从海外派遣回新中国进行破坏的反革命分子的罪恶活动。邓以明接受被我国驱逐出境的帝国主义间谍福寿康的指挥，共同在广州组织偷渡集团，专门输送天主教内的反革命分子、地主分子偷越边境。1952年福寿康就与邓以明同谋，以三千元港币通过偷渡犯陈少光带一个叫林意芬的反动分子偷渡出境；同时，又把反革命分子赵炎偷渡往香港。1953年初，上海天主教内的反动分子吴乃元和黄超远到广州后，也是在福寿康、邓以明的帮助下偷渡出边境的；临行前夕，邓以明还替这两个反动分子“降福”，预祝他们偷渡成功。福寿康在广州窃探情报和进行破坏活动时，邓以明是积极参予者，他把通过教会所收集的文件都交给福寿康加以审查甄别，并且亲自派人为福寿康调查有关在我国被逮捕的美国间谍福尔德的情况。
    邓以明还和1955年12月在上海破获的隐藏在天主教内的龚品梅反革命集团勾结一起，阴谋纠集暗藏在全国各地区天主教内的反革命分子，扩大破坏活动。邓以明早在1951年的时候，就亲自到上海与龚品梅反革命集团取得联系，商讨如何联合全国天主教各教区的反革命分子来应付中国的新形势。在邓以明的提倡和龚品梅的支持下，召开了一次会议，参加的有邓以明、龚品梅和江西省天主教内的反动分子周济世，以及潜伏在上海的帝国主义分子。邓以明在上海期间，还拜访过帝国主义间谍格寿平，并同这个曾在我国进行了多年间谍活动的帝国主义分子密商。在他们密谋的问题中，包括反对天主教开展反帝爱国运动，爱国公约中不能写上拥护共产党，不能承认圣母军是反动组织，不能领导天主教内的抗美援朝运动等等。邓以明从上海回来以后，即在广州市的各个教堂内，对反帝爱国运动进行疯狂的攻击和破坏。1953年5月间，邓以明又派了广州天主教会内的反革命分子谭天德等人以“朝圣”为名，到上海学习龚品梅反革命集团的反革命活动经验。
    邓以明为了阴谋扩大破坏活动，在1952年初还亲自同上海的反革命分子黄铧全取得联系，互相交换两地的中苏友好活动和天主教爱国运动的情报。黄铧全曾把上海天主教内帝国主义分子的活动情况、人民政府组织天主教神甫和修士学习等情报送给邓以明，以供应海外帝国主义分子。1954年，邓以明又同潜藏在湖南省衡阳市天主教会内的万次章反革命集团取得联系，供应经费给这个反革命集团；万次章也把当地天主教展开反帝爱国运动的情报向邓以明报告。1955年1月，邓以明又同河南新乡天主教内的反革命分子取得联系，并立即指派反动分子张国珍在广州建立联络据点，从事秘密转款活动。1955年2月，潜藏在汕头市天主教会内的反革命分子黄克仁到广州，受到邓以明的“礼待”，邓以明曾和黄克仁用两天时间交换两地天主教爱国运动的情况，并商谈帝国主义分子黎培里被我国驱逐出境后如何利用各地教会继续进行反革命活动的问题。黄克仁提出要集中各地教区领导人进行商量，邓以明则提出“黎培里虽不在中国，但香港还有人，可以向他请示”。邓以明还介绍黄克仁到上海与龚品梅反革命集团联系，并替黄克仁在广州设立一个联系据点，以各种代号来交换情报。
    邓以明对历次政治运动都极端仇视。抗美援朝期间，青年教徒纷纷报名参加志愿军，邓以明曾亲自加以阻止。土地改革期间，他又积极煽动教徒反对土改，支持地主，辱骂农民和土改工作干部。邓以明也污蔑五反运动，不准教徒参加这个运动。
    邓以明仇视人民政府和拒绝执行政府的法令，特别表现在1953年广州市军事管制委员会宣布取缔反动“圣母军”组织的时候。邓以明当时曾召开会议，研究破坏的对策，指示“圣母军”分子不能向人民政府登记，已经退出“圣母军”的分子要向人民政府声明撤销登记，并且利用神权打击、威胁一些已经登记退出“圣母军”的人，并煽动“圣母军”分子要“勇敢一些”；对一些抗拒政府法令的分子则加以鼓励、照顾。
    在1955年肃反运动期间，上海破获了龚品梅反革命集团，邓以明获悉后，立即烧毁和分散了同这个反革命集团有关的反动文件、照片、信函以及长期秘密保存下来的国民党党旗。另一方面，他又到处向神职人员散播“教难”空气，恐吓他们“要准备坐牢”。当天主教会的反革命分子曾庆麟被依法逮捕时，邓以明却说曾庆麟是“教会模范”“标准青年”，肆意诬蔑肃反运动。直到去年，邓以明还组织天主教内的一些人分头上诉，企图为在押的反革命分子谭天德等翻案。在整风运动开始时，邓以明又布置和唆使一些神职人员，在鸣放座谈会上公开攻击肃反运动，要求释放在押的反革命分子。
    邓以明竭力破坏天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，利用宗教神权打击爱国教徒。早在1951年2月，他就同潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子马良、颜益群等研究破坏天主教内爱国运动的计划。当他担任主教职位以后，首先就迫使神职人员退出爱国运动。
    邓以明到上海与龚品梅反革命集团取得联系后，更加积极地策划由反革命分子谭天德等在各个教堂疯狂进行对反帝爱国运动的进攻，污蔑和打击教徒中的爱国积极分子，拉拢和胁迫教徒退出爱国运动。1953年5月，他派反革命分子谭天德去上海学习龚品梅反革命集团的反革命经验，谭回来后就组织了所谓“纠察队”，对爱国积极分子采取造谣、侮辱、歧视、捣乱等手段进行打击、破坏，同时监视爱国教徒，不准他们进教堂过宗教生活。邓以明先在石室教堂对教徒宣布“凡教友不准参加反帝爱国运动，不准在驱逐外国神长（帝国主义分子）的控诉会上签名”。广州天主教徒成立爱国会筹委会后，邓以明又说爱国会是“害教”的，爱国会成员应被“弃绝”，否则就给予“处罚”。据初步统计，因为参加控诉帝国主义分子罪行、退出反动“圣母军”组织、参加爱国会或热心参加街坊工作而遭受其打击的爱国教徒就达二百八十多人。甚至爱国教徒的家属，邓以明也说是有“罪”，要“处罚”。有一名儿童教徒因为参加了少先队，就被扭耳朵，掴巴掌，连红领巾也被撕毁。在邓以明“主教府”里的“儿童要理班”中，竟出现“捉红颈鬼”（意指捉爱国教徒）的反动行为。邓以明对一般神职人员也严加控制并进行欺骗，干涉他们的爱国自由。1956年8月17日，邓以明曾给神职人员规定了许多限制，阻挠他们参加爱国活动。1956年有些神职人员当选人民代表，邓以明即加以严厉指责，说这是违反“教典”，“在教会中树立了坏榜样”，并说未经上级批准，神甫一律不能参加社会公共活动，否则就是反对教会和不听“教皇命令”。1955年12月8日，邓以明指使神职人员抗拒参加肃反大会；1956年5月，广州市举行“潜藏在教会内的反革命分子罪证展览会”，市人民委员会宗教事务处组织天主教神职人员参观，邓以明也竟然加以阻挠。邓以明还禁止神职人员阅读“信鸽”、“广场”等天主教的爱国书刊杂志。他对其他地区天主教徒的反帝爱国运动也曾进行干涉和打击。
    邓以明破坏天主教徒的反帝爱国运动和破坏祖国人民利益的罪行，过去虽然没有完全暴露出来，但因为他的有些罪恶活动非常猖狂，早就激起了一些爱国教徒的公愤。有人向公安机关检举了他。去年11月份以来，部分教徒群众又举行了一系列的集会，对邓以明进行了揭发和控诉。
