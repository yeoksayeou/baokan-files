Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th. The Beijing Railway Bureau's 1958 Advanced Producers and Workers Representatives Conference, held in Tianjin, concluded on the 11th.

    The advanced producers and representatives attending the meeting proposed at the closing session that since the Beijing Railway Bureau is located in the capital, it should strive to become the nation's railway leader in all aspects of its work. They advocated vigorously launching a daily production of one million ton-kilometers movement among railway workers nationwide to adapt to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production with a great leap forward in railway transportation. They guaranteed that before the "May Day" International Labor Day this year, the current daily production of 840,000 ton-kilometers would be increased to one million ton-kilometers, and on the basis of completing the state plan, an additional 80 million yuan would be produced and saved throughout the year.

    887 advanced producers and worker representatives attended the meeting. Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union Wang Zhijie, and Deputy Director of the Industry Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xing Jun, all attended the meeting and gave reports.

    In the past month or so, workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, in the vigorous anti-waste and catch-up-with-the-advanced movement, have been experiencing production upsurges that are surpassing one another. The annual plan targets formulated by the bureau have been broken three times by the actual actions of the workers' great leap forward. The advanced producers and worker representatives from various stations and sections attended this meeting with this vigorous revolutionary drive. Therefore, a wave of comparing with the advanced, comparing with the drive, and comparing with the leap forward emerged at the very beginning of the meeting. On the first day of the appraisal, the representatives of the telecommunications department, based on the fact that five of the eight telecommunications sections had reduced the telephone error rate to zero, resolved to improve quality and eliminate errors. When each section was evaluating the labor productivity indicators, the representative of the Guye Section first proposed a leap forward plan to increase labor productivity by 41.5% in 1958. The representative of the Cangxian Section quickly caught up, proposing on the spot that the labor productivity indicator should be increased by 43.3%, surpassing the Guye Section. During the lunch break, the representatives of the Shijiazhuang Section also held an emergency meeting to learn from the Cangxian Section's methods of reforming the shift system and merging work areas, so that the labor productivity indicator was increased to more than 40%. Finally, the representatives of the Guye Section once again calculated, adopting measures such as improving the technical level of workers, and increased the labor productivity indicator to 51.1%, taking the lead again. After the labor productivity indicators of each section are realized, the telecommunications departments of the entire bureau can compress the number of established personnel by 44.8% this year. This spirit of striving to be upstream is also fully reflected in the evaluation meetings of business departments such as locomotive, engineering, and various marshalling stations. After evaluation by the representatives of each locomotive section, they further tapped their potential, making the daily production ton-kilometer indicators leap forward by a big step. Among the seven locomotive sections in the entire bureau, except for the Nankou Section, which has less cargo, the daily production ton-kilometer indicators of the other six sections have reached or exceeded one million.

    Outside the meeting, the workers of various stations and sections are constantly supporting the representatives' efforts to strive for the upstream with practical actions. From February 1st to 8th, the average daily number of loaded wagons in the entire bureau increased by 7% compared with the same period in January, and various major technical indicators have also improved. During the meeting, workers from some stations and sections reported good news to the representatives every day with new production achievements. The report of victory telegram sent by the workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot to the conference on the 8th stated: On that day, 20 drivers broke the technical speed indicators, 42 drivers saved locomotive coal, and the average material cost for washing and repairing a locomotive was 64.53 yuan. Two days later, another telegram of victory was sent, saying: 24 drivers broke the technical speed indicators, 48 drivers saved locomotive coal, and the average material cost for washing and repairing a locomotive was reduced to 53 yuan, one of which only cost 25 yuan. In a letter of victory to the conference, the workers of Shijiazhuang Station stated: The entire station's workers grasped the direction of traffic flow, incorporated the organization of over-axle trains into the plan, and organized 107 over-axle trains from February 1st to 8th, completing an over-axle task of more than 59,000 tons, which is more than 30,000 tons more than the total over-axle tonnage in January. The conference received a total of 549 letters of victory from workers of various stations and sections, forming a situation where the inside and outside of the conference echoed each other, and the entire railway was filled with the sound of a leap forward. As a result, all eleven major planned targets proposed by the entire Beijing Railway Bureau have caught up with and surpassed the most advanced level of the national railway's 1958 plan.

    让铁路运输同工农业一齐跃进
    北京铁路局职工大誓师争取样样工作名列第一
    新华社天津13日电　北京铁路管理局在天津召开的1958年先进生产者及职工代表会议11日闭幕。
    出席会议的先进生产者和代表们在闭幕会上提出：北京铁路管理局位于首都，应该要求自己在一切工作方面，努力成为全国铁路第一。他们倡议在全国铁路职工中大力开展日产百万吨公里运动，以铁路运输的大跃进来适应工农业生产大跃进。他们保证在今年“五一”劳动节以前，由现在日产八十四万吨公里提高到一百万吨公里，并且在完成国家计划的基础上，全年再增产节约八千万元。
    出席这次会议的，有先进生产者和职工代表八百八十七人。铁道部部长滕代远、铁路工会全国委员会主席王志杰、中共北京市委工业部副部长邢军，都到会作了报告。
    近一个多月来，北京铁路管理局的职工在轰轰烈烈的反浪费、赶先进运动中，出现了一班赛过一班的生产高潮。局里制订的本年度计划指标，已经三度被职工大跃进的实际行动突破。各站、段的先进生产者和职工代表带着这种蓬勃的革命干劲出席这次会议。因此，会议一开始就出现了比先进、比干劲、比跃进的热潮。电务部门的代表在评比的第一天，根据八个电务段中有五个段已经把电话差错率降低到零的情况，决心提高质量，消灭差错。各段评比劳动生产率指标的时候，古冶段的代表首先提出1958年提高劳动生产率41.5％的跃进计划。沧县段的代表急起直追，当场提出劳动生产率指标要提高43.3％，超过古冶段。在中午休会期间，石家庄段的代表也开了紧急会议，学习沧县段改革班制、合并工区的办法，使劳动生产率指标提高到40％以上。最后，古冶段的代表又一次核算，采取提高工人技术水平等措施，把劳动生产率指标提高到51.1％，再次领先。各段劳动生产率指标实现以后，全局电务部门今年就可以压缩定员人数44.8％。这种力争上游的精神，也充分体现在机务、工务和各编组站等业务部门的评比会中。各机务段的代表经过评比，进一步挖掘潜力，使日产吨公里指标都向前跃进了一大步。全局七个机务段，除货源较少的南口段以外，其余六个段的日产吨公里指标都达到或超过一百万。
    在会外，各站、段职工更是不断地以实际行动支持代表力争上游。全局2月份1日到8日的平均每天装车数比一月份同期增加7％，各项主要技术指标也都有提高。会议期间，每天都有些站、段的职工以新的生产成绩向代表们报捷。丰台机务段职工8日向大会拍来的报捷电报中说：当天有二十名司机突破了技术速度指标，有四十二名司机节省了机煤，洗修一台机车平均使用材料费六十四点五三元。过两天又拍来报捷电报说：有二十四名司机突破了技术速度指标，四十八名司机节省了机煤，洗修一台机车的平均使用材料费用降低到五十三元，其中有一台仅用二十五元。石家庄站的职工在给大会的报捷信中说：全站职工掌握好车流方向，把组织超轴列车纳入计划，从2月1日到8日就组织超轴列车一百零七列，完成超轴任务五万九千多吨，比1月份全月的超轴吨数还多了三万多吨。会议共收到各站、段职工的报捷信五百四十九件，形成了会内会外相呼应，全路一片跃进声。结果，整个北京铁路管理局提出的十一项主要计划指标，都已赶上并超过全国铁路1958年计划的最先进的水平。
