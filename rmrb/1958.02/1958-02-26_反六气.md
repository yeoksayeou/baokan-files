Against the Six "Qi"

A Communist Youth League organization, during a meeting, proposed opposing the six "qi". Now, these six slogans they put forward are extracted as follows:

	Contact the masses,		oppose bureaucracy;
	Brace yourselves,		oppose lethargy;
	Be modest and prudent,		oppose arrogance;
	Be diligent and thrifty,		oppose extravagance;
	Be strong and brave,		oppose fragility;
	Be strict with oneself,		oppose resentment.

    反六气
    一个青年团组织开会时，提出反对六气，现把他们提出的这六个口号摘出来：
    联系群众，　反对官气；
    振作精神，　反对暮气；
    谦虚谨慎，　反对傲气；
    勤苦节俭，　反对阔气；
    坚强勇敢，　反对娇气；
    严以责己，　反对怨气。
