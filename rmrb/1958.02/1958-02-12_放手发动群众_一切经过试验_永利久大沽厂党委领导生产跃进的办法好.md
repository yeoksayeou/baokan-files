Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 11th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yin Chongjing reported: The Chinese Communist Party's Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Factory Committee, in the great leap forward in production, implemented a leadership method of "boldly mobilizing the masses, with everything tested through experimentation," and achieved great results. For this factory's important product's output, quality, and consumption quotas, everything that could be tested was handed over to the masses of workers to boldly experiment with. The results of the experiments all reached or even exceeded the predetermined leap forward targets. As a result, everyone had a clear understanding and was full of confidence in preparing to strive to complete their own formulated leap forward plans.

　　In the beginning, in formulating the great leap forward plan, the Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Factory was severely hindered by conservative thinking. Conservative people wanted to follow the old formulas and said the leap forward targets proposed by the masses were "nonsense." Some even claimed, "You have political principles, I have technical principles." When the clash between advanced thinking and conservative thinking became difficult to resolve, many leading cadres, because they usually didn't go deep into the masses and rely on them enough, were also unsure about whether there was any production potential, and showed weak and ineffective leadership.

　　The Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Factory Party Committee made a full study of all these situations and decided to implement a leadership method of "boldly mobilizing the masses, with everything tested through experimentation," letting the masses judge who was right and who was wrong through experimentation. Therefore, more than 30 leading cadres from the Party, government, labor union, Communist Youth League, and technical departments formed a leading group, went deep into the workshops, held meetings with the workers, listened to the workers' opinions and methods, and prepared for various experiments together with the workers.

　　Could the daily output of soda ash, the factory's main product, be increased? This was the most important question to be solved in the experiment. Starting on January 19th, all the workers in the four workshops of the soda ash system organized a grand review of the production leap forward. On this day, the highest record of daily soda ash production since the factory was built was created, an increase of 26% compared with the average daily output last year. On the fourth day of the grand review, an even higher record was created, with daily output increasing by another 8%. The workers broke countless conventions in the four days. They fed in more than one ton of raw materials—limestone and salt—every hour. The flywheels of more than a dozen carbonation machines were all accelerated by five to twenty revolutions. The quota for each drying pot before liberation was only forty-five tons, which gradually increased to eighty-five tons over the years, and this time it was increased to over one hundred tons.

　　The experiment to improve the quality of magnesium carbonate was of great significance to this factory. Because the quality of this product had been low for a long time, not meeting the production requirements of other industrial sectors, several thousand packages had been stockpiled in the warehouse of the Tianjin Chemical Raw Materials Procurement and Supply Station. Therefore, this was not only a question of whether or not there could be a leap forward, but also a question of whether or not production could continue. The Party Committee organized relevant technical personnel and workers to hold a discussion meeting to study this issue. The technical personnel planned to fundamentally change the production method of magnesium carbonate, but four key production problems could not be solved, so they raised this issue to all the workers and asked them to offer suggestions. The workers solved all the problems after two hours of discussion. The most important of these was the issue of increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide. It was originally thought that it would be impossible without adding major equipment, but veteran worker Zhang Yuanming proposed improving the operation method, changing the feeding (limestone) from twice per shift to three times per shift, allowing the combustion layer to move down, and the concentration of carbon dioxide immediately increased by more than ten degrees. On February 3rd, the eighth day of experimenting with the new production method, the quality of magnesium carbonate increased from 87% in the past to 97.34%, fully meeting the requirements of first-class products.

　　Now the factory's Party Committee realizes that going deep into the masses, boldly mobilizing the masses, experimenting everything through the masses, and then letting the masses implement it with full confidence is a good leadership method and also a good leadership style.

### 放手发动群众　一切经过试验  永利久大沽厂党委领导生产跃进的办法好

    放手发动群众　一切经过试验
    永利久大沽厂党委领导生产跃进的办法好
    据新华社天津11日电　新华社记者尹崇敬报道：中共永利久大沽厂委员会在生产大跃进中实行“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的领导方法，收到很大效果。这个厂重要产品的产量、质量和消耗定额凡能试验的，都交给职工群众大胆的进行试验。试验的结果都达到甚至超过了预定的跃进指标。因而人人心中有数，信心百倍地准备为完成自己制订的跃进计划而奋斗。
    永利久大沽厂起初在制定大跃进的计划中，受到保守思想的严重阻碍，保守的人们要按照老一套的公式办事，对于群众提出的跃进指标，说是“胡来”。有人还声称：“你有政治原则，我有技术原则”。在先进思想和保守思想交锋得难解难分的时候，不少领导干部由于平时深入群众依靠群众不够，对于到底有无生产潜力也是心中无数，表现出领导软弱无力。
    永利久大沽厂党委对这一切情况作了充分的研究，确定实行“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的领导方法，让群众在试验中判明谁是谁非。于是，党、政、工、团和技术部门的领导干部一共三十多人组成了领导小组，分别深入车间，和工人一起开会，听取工人们的意见和办法，和工人一起进行各项试验的准备工作。
    这个厂主要产品纯碱的日产量能不能提高？这是试验中要解决的一个最重要的问题。1月19日开始，纯碱系统四个车间的全体职工组织了生产跃进大检阅。这一天，纯碱日产量就创造建厂以来的最高纪录，比去年平均日产量提高了26％。大检阅的第四天，又创造了一个更高的纪录，日产量又提高了8％。工人们在四天当中打破了无数陈规，他们每小时都投进去一吨以上的原料——石灰石和食盐，十几部炭酸机的飞轮都加快了五转到二十转，每只干燥锅在解放以前的定额都只有四十五吨，几年来逐渐提高到八十五吨，这次又提高到一百吨以上。
    提高炭酸镁质量的试验，对这个厂具有很大的意义。由于这个产品长期以来质量不高，不合其他工业部门生产的要求，天津化工原料采购供应站仓库里已积压了好几千包，因而这不单是能不能跃进，而且是能不能继续生产下去的问题了。党委组织有关的技术人员和工人举行座谈会，对这个问题进行研究。技术人员打算根本改变炭酸镁的生产方法，但有四个生产上的关键问题没法解决，于是向全体工人提出这个问题请他们献计。工人们经过两个钟头的讨论就全部解决了。其中最重要的一项是关于提高炭酸气的浓度问题，原以为不增加主要设备是不成的，可是，老工人张元明提出了改进操作方法，把每班两次投料（石灰石）改为三次投料，让燃烧层下移，炭酸气的浓度立即提高了十度以上。试验新生产方法的第八天——2月3日，炭酸镁的质量由过去的87％提高到了97.34％，完全合乎一级品的要求。
    现在这个厂的党委体会到：深入群众、放手发动群众，一切经过群众试验、再让群众充满信心地去实行，是一种好的领导方法，也是一种好的领导作风。
