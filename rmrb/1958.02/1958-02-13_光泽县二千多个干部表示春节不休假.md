More Than Two Thousand Cadres in Guangze County Indicate They Will Not Take a Holiday for the Spring Festival

(Our Dispatch) Fuzhou, Fujian—Recently, more than two thousand two hundred rural cadres in Guangze County, Fujian, have successively reported to the county and district Party committees that they will voluntarily give up their Spring Festival holiday and continue to lead production.

Some township cadres and the masses in Guangze County developed blind complacency due to the considerable achievements made in winter production. Many cadres were preparing for the Spring Festival, and the masses were also busy preparing for the New Year, bringing many tasks to a standstill imperceptibly. Yangtang Township, which had been at the forefront of various tasks, had, by the end of January, doubled its original plans in all areas compared to 1955. The masses felt this was sufficient, and the cadres no longer mobilized the masses to continue working. Based on these ideological conditions, the CCP Guangze County Committee analyzed the reasons for the cadres and masses' blind complacency and decided to launch a major debate throughout the county on "what harm does right-leaning conservative thinking do to production" in conjunction with the rectification movement, and to conduct a comprehensive inspection and comparison of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and other tasks in various townships. More than two thousand two hundred rural cadres throughout the county responded to the call of the County Party Committee and successively proposed to the county and district Party committees to give up their Spring Festival holidays and persist in leading the masses in production.

    光泽县二千多个干部表示春节不休假
    本报讯　福建光泽县全县二千二百多个农村干部，最近纷纷向县、区委表示，自动放弃春节假期休假，继续领导生产。
    光泽县有些乡干部和群众因冬季生产获得相当成绩，产生了盲目自满情绪。许多干部都准备过春节，群众也忙着准备过年，很多工作无形中停顿下来。原来各项工作都跑在前头的洋塘乡，到1月下旬止，原订各项计划都比1955年翻了一翻，这样群众就认为差不多了，干部也不去发动群众继续再干了。中共光泽县委根据这些思想情况，分析了干部群众产生盲目自满的原因，决定结合整风在全县开展一次“右倾保守思想对生产有什么害处”的大辩论，并对各乡水利积肥等工作进行全面的检查评比。全县二千二百多个农村干部响应县委的号召，纷纷向县区委提出放弃春节休假，坚持领导群众生产。
