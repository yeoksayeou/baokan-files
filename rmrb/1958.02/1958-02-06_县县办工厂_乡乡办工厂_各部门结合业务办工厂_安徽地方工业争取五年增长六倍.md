    Anhui Local Industry Strives for a Six-Fold Increase in Five Years
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 5th dispatch) While accelerating the development of agriculture, Anhui Province has decided to accelerate the development of local industry, striving to have the value of local industrial output catch up with or exceed the value of agricultural output within five to seven years. This is another goal set by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at a meeting of county-level Party committee secretaries held at the end of January.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee requires the entire Party to take action, mobilizing all possible manpower, materials, and financial resources, relying on the masses, relying on our own efforts, and, according to the characteristics of local resources, implementing the policy of counties running factories, townships running factories, and all departments running factories in conjunction with their business needs, to launch a new upsurge in the development of industry. At the meeting, Party committees at all levels unanimously agreed that this goal must be strived to be achieved.
    Although Anhui frequently suffers from natural disasters, the development of agricultural production is still very rapid. Because the industrial base is weak, industrial production is far behind agriculture in terms of output value. According to statistics for 1957, the total agricultural output value of the province was more than 3.3 billion yuan, while the local industrial output value was only more than 1.1 billion yuan. Local industry accounted for only 25% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The difference between the two output values was two-fold. By 1962, when the production targets of the National Agricultural Development Program are achieved ahead of schedule, the agricultural output value will increase to at least 7.1 billion yuan, which will be almost six times higher than the current local industry. According to statistics, in 1957, local products accounted for only 30% of the total sales of industrial products in the province, while products transferred from other provinces accounted for more than 60%. If local industry in this province does not change this backward situation and does not accelerate to catch up with agricultural development, it will not only seriously affect the increase in agricultural production, but also will not be able to meet the growing needs of the province's more than 30 million people in production and life.
    In the preliminary plan to strive to have the value of local industrial output in Anhui Province catch up with or exceed the value of agricultural output within five to seven years, the main focus is on vigorously developing coal, fertilizers, farm tools, electricity, textiles, food, and agricultural and sideline product processing industries. In terms of developing the coal industry, coal production will be increased from more than 90,000 tons in 1957 to 4 million to 5 million tons per year, an increase of more than 50 times. The province's coal needs will be strived to be self-sufficient within five years. In order to achieve this plan, many small and medium-sized mines and coal kilns will be established in the Huaibei Zhahe Plain and along the Huai River and Yangtze River. In terms of steel production, by 1962, the province's pig iron production will increase from more than 15,000 tons in 1957 to 520,000 tons, and 250,000 tons of steel will be produced. Now, Anhui Province has already built small blast furnaces and steel plants in Ma'anshan, Tongguanshan, Dangtu, Fanchang, Bengbu, Hefei, and other places. In terms of the electric power industry, in 1962, the province's power generation will increase from the current 50 million kilowatt-hours to more than 500 million kilowatt-hours, of which more than 360 million kilowatt-hours will be generated by the already built and to-be-built Foziling, Xianghongdian, and Mozitan hydropower stations, and the rest will be generated by developing a large number of small hydropower stations. In addition, due to the development of agriculture, fertilizer, machinery, textiles, agricultural and sideline product processing, and light industries for daily use will also be greatly developed. According to the plan, by 1962, the industrial output value of coal, electricity, and metal smelting will reach more than 350 million yuan, the chemical fertilizer industry and machinery industry will reach more than 760 million yuan, the textile and daily-use light industries will reach more than 2.25 billion yuan, and food processing and other industries will reach more than 3.99 billion yuan. The total of the above is more than 7.35 billion yuan. After completing the above indicators, the value of local industrial output will reach the level of the total agricultural production value in 1962.
    The foundation of local industry in Anhui Province is weak. To realize this plan, the output value must increase by 45% every year. If measured by conventional methods, there are difficulties. However, judging from the abundance of resources in Anhui, the development of agriculture, the vastness of the market, the enthusiasm of Party committees and the masses at all levels, and the support from all sides, as long as we overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and muster revolutionary vigor, it is very possible to strive to have the value of local industrial output catch up with or exceed the value of agricultural output within five years. In the early days of liberation in 1949, the output value of local industry in Anhui Province was only more than 250 million yuan, but by 1957 it had increased to more than 1.1 billion yuan. After breaking with conventions, the speed of development will be even faster. For example, this year's local industrial output value is planned to increase by 52% compared with 1957.
    In terms of funds, there are some difficulties, but as long as we rely on the masses and mobilize counties, townships, and departments to run small-scale industries according to the characteristics of local resources and business needs, there will be ways to solve them. Last year, counties such as Fanchang, Tongling, Guichi, Taihu, Qingyang, and Ningguo relied on investments from special districts and counties to run small iron mines, coal mines, lead-zinc mines, tea factories, and power plants. Counties such as Dangtu also built several paper mills. Among them, Fanchang County alone can produce 100,000 tons of ore annually from its self-run iron mine. Last year, the number of granular fertilizer plants run by counties and agricultural cooperatives reached 160, and this year, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province initially plan to build more than 10,000 granular fertilizer plants. It is also an effective way to solve funding problems for various departments to run industries in conjunction with their business needs. For example, last year, various departments ran many factories. Just by organizing cadres to participate in production during the reorganization of the financial and trade departments, 220 small factories were established in 62 counties to process agricultural and sideline products and make paper, which achieved very good results. This year, they also plan to build more than 100 small processing plants.

　　县县办工厂　乡乡办工厂　各部门结合业务办工厂
    安徽地方工业争取五年增长六倍
    本报合肥5日电　安徽省在加快发展农业的同时，决定快马加鞭发展地方工业，争取在五年到七年的时间内使地方工业的产值赶上或超过农业的产值。这是中共安徽省委在1月底举行的县以上党委书记会议上提出的另一个奋斗目标。
    安徽省委要求全党动手，调动一切可能调动的人力、物力、财力，依靠群众，自力更生，按照各地资源的特点，实行县县办工厂，乡乡办工厂，各部门结合业务需要办工厂，掀起一个发展工业的新高潮。在会议上，各级党委一致认为这一奋斗目标是必须努力达到的。
    安徽虽然经常遭受自然灾害，农业生产的发展还是很快。工业生产因为基础薄弱，在产值比例上和农业相差很远。根据1957年统计，全省农业产值为三十三亿多元，地方工业产值只有十一亿多元。地方工业只占工农业总产值的25％。两者产值差距达两倍。到1962年提前实现全国农业发展纲要的产量指标时，农业产值至少将增长到七十一亿元，就要比现在的地方工业高过近六倍。据统计，在1957年全省工业品的销售总额中，本省产品只占30％多，而由外省调进的产品占60％以上。本省地方工业如果不改变这种落后现状，不加快赶上农业发展，不但将会严重影响农业的增产，而且不能适应全省三千多万人民在生产和生活上日益增长的需要。
    安徽省在争取五年到七年内使地方工业产值赶上或超过农业产值的初步规划中，主要是大力发展煤炭、肥料、农具、电力以及纺织、食品、农副产品加工等工业。在发展煤炭工业方面，要把煤炭生产由1957年的年产九万多吨增加到年产四百到五百万吨，即增加到五十多倍。本省需要的煤炭，争取在五年内自给自足。为了实现这个计划，将在淮北闸河平原和沿淮、沿江各地建立许多中小型矿井和煤窑。在钢铁生产方面，到1962年全省生铁产量将由1957年的一万五千多吨增加到五十二万吨，并将生产二十五万吨钢。现在，安徽省已经在马鞍山、铜官山、当涂、繁昌、蚌埠、合肥等地建设小型炼铁炉和钢厂。在电力工业方面，1962年全省发电量将由现在的五千多万度，增加到五亿多度，其中有三亿六千多万度，靠已建和待建的佛子岭、响洪甸及磨子潭三个水电站发电外，其余将大量发展小型水力发电站。此外，由于农业的发展，肥料、机械、纺织、农副产品加工和日用品轻工业也将有很大发展。在规划中，到1962年，煤、电、金属冶炼的工业产值将达三亿五千多万元，化学肥料工业、机械工业将达七亿六千多万元，纺织、日用品轻工业将达二十二亿五千多万元，食品加工及其他三十九亿九千多万元。以上共计七十三亿五千多万元。完成上述指标后，地方工业产值将可达到1962年农业生产总值的水平。
    安徽省地方工业基础薄弱，要实现这个规划，每年的产值就要递增45％。如果拿常规来衡量，困难是存在的。但是从安徽资源的丰富、农业的发展、市场的广阔、各级党委和群众的积极性以及各方面的支援来看，只要克服右倾保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，在五年内争取地方工业产值赶上或超过农业产值是有很大可能的。安徽省地方工业在刚解放后的1949年，产值只有两亿五千多万元，到了1957年就增长到十一亿多。在打破常规后，发展速度将会更快。如今年地方工业的产值就计划要比1957年增长52％。
    在资金方面，有些困难，但只要依靠群众，发动各县各乡和各部门根据当地资源特点和业务需要兴办小型工业，就有办法解决。去年，繁昌、铜陵、贵池、太湖、青阳、宁国等县都靠专区和县的投资兴办了小型铁矿、煤矿、铅锌矿、茶厂、电厂等。当涂等县还办了好几个造纸厂。其中繁昌一个县自办的铁矿每年就可生产矿石十万吨。去年各县和农业合作社自办的颗粒肥料厂即达一百六十个，今年全省农业社初步打算兴办一万多个颗粒肥料厂。由各部门结合业务需要兴办工业，也是解决资金的有效办法。如去年各部门都办了不少工厂，只是财贸部门整编中组织干部参加生产，就在六十二个县办了二百二十个小型工厂，进行农副业产品加工及造纸等，获得很好效果。今年他们还准备再兴办一百多个小型加工厂。
