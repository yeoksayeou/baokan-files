Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: During the Spring Festival on the 17th and 18th, workers and peasants in Anshan, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and other places widely launched festive activities.

　　Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and farmers in the suburbs of Anshan City visited and celebrated each other before the Spring Festival. Workers from the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant visited the Zhongyi Agricultural Production Cooperative, with which they have had two or three years of friendship. They visited the cooperative's glass cellars and pigsties where leeks and celery were growing. Members of the agricultural cooperative told the workers that the glass cellars were newly built to ensure that the workers could eat fresh vegetables even in the freezing weather; this year, each cooperative member would also raise two or three fat pigs to support the workers.

　　In Chongqing, many factory and mine workers organized New Year visiting teams, and on the 18th, they enthusiastically paid New Year visits to farmers in suburban agricultural cooperatives with drums, dragon lanterns, and lion dances. Four New Year visiting teams organized by the Chongqing Jialing Machinery Factory visited four agricultural cooperatives, including Zhanwang and Guangming, on the 18th. More than 250 employees who went to Zhanwang Agricultural Cooperative held a get-together with thousands of local farmers, exchanged gifts, performed entertainment programs, and then groups of workers cordially discussed production and living conditions with the farmers. Li Zhaoyuan, director of Zhanwang Agricultural Cooperative, introduced to the employees that, compared with last year, this year the average yield of grain per mu in the whole cooperative will leap from 616 jin to 1,100 jin, the yield of vegetables per mu will leap from about 10,000 jin to 20,000 jin, and the number of pigs raised will increase eight times. More than 4,000 farmers in the cooperative will raise 160,000 poultry this year. Representatives of the Jialing Machinery Factory expressed that they would learn well from the spirit of the farmers of Zhanwang Cooperative, who are willing to work hard and boldly leap forward, and also expressed that this year they would also leap from the original plan of increasing production and saving 10 million yuan to 20 million yuan. In Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative, on the 18th, employees from six factories and enterprises came to pay New Year visits to the farmers. Employees from Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant specially brought gifts such as chisels, hammers, and sledgehammers made during the holiday on the 17th to the cooperative. The employees also expressed that they would support the agricultural cooperative with 3,000 workdays in the first quarter of this year to help them achieve the plan of doubling grain and vegetable production. Many farmers in the suburbs of Chongqing also carried fresh fish and vegetables to pay New Year visits to the factory and mine workers before the Spring Festival. When Nanping Agricultural Cooperative paid New Year visits to the employees of Chongqing Cement Plant, they sent the employees more than 600 jin of vegetables and 100 jin of live fresh fish, visited the factory, and had cordial discussions with the employees.

　　Employees of Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1 visited Qinfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the western suburbs on the 18th. During the get-together, employees and farmers signed a labor-peasant alliance friendship competition contract. The employees of the cigarette factory guaranteed that this year, in addition to completing the planned targets of more than 310,000 cases of cigarettes (calculated at 50,000 cigarettes per case) and more than 6 million yuan of profits to be turned over to the state, they would save another 2 million yuan. The employees also planned to go to the countryside to participate in voluntary labor according to the needs of the agricultural cooperative and the possibilities of the factory, organize medical forces to go to the countryside, amateur cultural troupes to go to the countryside, trucks to go to the countryside, and waste materials to go to the countryside to support the farmer brothers of Qinfeng Cooperative. The farmers of Qinfeng Cooperative are determined to compete with the employees of the cigarette factory with the leap forward targets of reaching 500 jin of cotton (seed cotton) per mu this year (130 jin last year), 10,000 jin of vegetables per mu (more than 7,000 jin last year), and raising 1,078 pigs (more than 300 last year). The employees and farmers also enthusiastically discussed the situation of both sides setting off a production upsurge today.

　　At the Xiaohongmen Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative construction site of the reservoir in Nanyuan District, Beijing, on the 18th, a labor front of more than 400 meters long was set up. 1,500 workers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and students, together with more than 1,000 members of the agricultural cooperative, were engaged in water conservancy construction and held a get-together during the labor rest time. People came to work and celebrate with the farmers one after another. The crowd from Beijing No. 2 Printing Factory and Chongwen District People's Committee had not yet left the construction site, and the voluntary labor team composed of workers and cadres led by the Secretary of the Nanyuan District Committee of the Communist Party of China also came with colorful flags, gongs and drums. The stevedores of the Coal Construction Company performed the "Lion Dance" for the farmers, and the members of the Hongguang Cooperative also performed the local yangko dance for the visitors.

　　The workers of the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill invited the members of their neighbor, the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative, to the factory on the evening of the 17th to celebrate the New Year's Eve together.
