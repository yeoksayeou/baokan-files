Everyone Cares for Transferred Cadres

　　Should transferred cadres do social work? Comrade Lin Qing:

　　Your letter raises the question: Among the comrades transferred with you, some, although they labor well and are praised by the farmers, are unwilling to do social work and unwilling to be concerned about the affairs of the cooperative.

　　Why are they unwilling to do social work? The main reason is they have the idea that they came down here for labor training, and that doing a good job in labor is enough. Doing social work would affect their training and transformation.

　　Yes, training and transforming oneself through labor is very important. However, taking time out from labor to do some social work is also a kind of training. It can enable us to better understand the farmers' thoughts and lives, more deeply appreciate the reality of rural society, and exercise our practical work abilities. Participating in labor and participating in social work are actually two sides of the same coin. Of course, it is not to say that there is no distinction between primary and secondary. For comrades who are transferred to participate in labor training, labor is still the primary thing, because they are, after all, different from comrades who are transferred to participate in grassroots work.

　　Will doing social work affect labor training? According to the situation of most transferred comrades, it not only does not affect their training and transformation, but also helps their training and transformation. Therefore, many comrades below actively participate in labor on the one hand, and strive to do some social work on the other. Some have become teachers in people's schools and news readers; some have become broadcasters and editors of blackboard newspapers; some have helped farmers carry out cultural and recreational activities; some have actively participated in the rural socialist debates and actively engaged in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside; some have enthusiastically helped cooperative cadres evaluate work and record work points, study ways to increase production, and do political work... In short, they enthusiastically help with everything they are needed for, and do their best in everything they can.

　　Many comrades feel that their relationship with the masses has become closer from helping farmers learn culture, seek knowledge, and carry out cultural and recreational activities, and they are able to more deeply appreciate the thoughts and feelings of the peasant masses. From participating in the socialist debates in the countryside, they have received vivid and concrete class education, and have a relatively clear understanding of the nature of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside. Many comrades feel that in the process of helping cooperative cadres do work and deal with problems, they have learned to use the method of class analysis and the method of the mass line. Are these not the training and transformation of the transferred comrades' stand, viewpoint, method, and thoughts and feelings? How could it be as some comrades think: that doing social work will affect their training and transformation?

　　It is speculated that the reason why some comrades think that doing social work will affect their training and transformation, and therefore are unwilling to do social work, only wanting to bury themselves in production, may be due to insufficient understanding of the necessity of doing social work, or it may be due to the laziness. May those with insufficient understanding become "sufficient," may those with lazy thoughts become diligent, and may all transferred comrades be able to do some social work as much as possible!

### 下放干部要不要做社会工作？

专栏：大家都来关怀下放干部

    下放干部要不要做社会工作？林清同志：
    你的来信提出了这样一个问题：就是同你一起下放的同志中间，有人虽然劳动得很好，并且得到了农民的好评，但是不愿意做社会工作，不愿意过问社里的事情。
    为什么不愿意做社会工作呢？主要是他们有这样一种想法：下来就是来劳动锻炼的，劳动好了就行了，做社会工作会影响到自己的锻炼和改造。
    是的，在劳动中锻炼改造自己，这是十分重要的。但是，在劳动之余，抽时间做些社会工作，也是一种锻炼，它可以使我们更多地了解农民的思想和生活情况，更深地体会农村社会的实际，并锻炼我们的实际工作能力。参加劳动和参加社会工作，实际上是一种二而一的关系。当然，并不是说两者之间就没有主次之分，对于下放参加劳动锻炼的同志来说，劳动还是主要的，因为他们毕竟同下放去参加基层工作的同志不一样。
    做了社会工作是不是就会影响劳动锻炼呢？根据大多数下放同志的情况来看，不但不会影响到自己的锻炼和改造，而且有助于自己的锻炼和改造。因此，许多同志在下面都是一方面积极参加劳动，一方面努力做一些社会工作。有的人当了民校教师、读报员；有的人当广播员、编黑板报；有的人帮助农民开展了文化娱乐活动；有的人积极参加了农村的社会主义大辩论，积极投入了农村两条道路的斗争；有的人热心地帮助社干部评工记账、研究增产办法、做政治工作……。总之，凡是需要他们帮助的，他们都热心地帮助，凡是他们力所能及的，他们都尽力地去做。
    很多同志从帮助农民学文化、求知识、开展文化娱乐活动中，感到自己和群众的关系密切了，能够比较深刻地体会到农民群众的思想感情了。从参加农村的社会主义大辩论中，受到了生动的、具体的阶级教育，比较清楚地认识了农村两条道路斗争的性质。很多同志感到在帮助社干部做工作、处理问题的过程中，学到了用阶级分析的方法，也学到了群众路线的方法。这些，难道不是对下放同志的立场、观点、方法和思想感情的锻炼和改造吗？怎么会像有些同志所想的：做社会工作会影响到自己的锻炼、改造呢？
    揣测起来，有些同志之所以认为做社会工作会影响到自己的锻炼、改造，因而不愿意做社会工作，只愿意埋头生产，可能是由于对做社会工作的必要性认识不足，也可能是由于懒汉思想的作怪。但愿认识不足的能够“足”起来，有懒汉思想的能够勤快起来，所有的下放同志都能够尽可能地做一些社会工作！
