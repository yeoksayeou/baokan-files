　　Five Kinds of Man-Made Fibers

　　The Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province has used five kinds of raw materials—cotton and hemp (cotton stalk skin), thatching grass, rice straw, banana tree bark, and paper mulberry bark—to trial-produce five kinds of man-made fibers by manual operation. The man-made fibers that were successfully trial-produced have been assessed by the Provincial Department of Industry and are considered to be of good quality and can be manufactured in large quantities.

　　These man-made fibers can be used to weave carpets, printed cloth, white cloth, canvas, socks, mosquito nets, gloves, towels, and麻袋 (ma dai, sacks). Banana fiber can also be used to make relatively valuable khaki fabric, and rice straw fiber can be used to make cotton wadding. If the above-mentioned various fibers are used to make clothing materials, 30%–40% of raw cotton needs to be added. Without adding raw cotton, they can be used to make cloth for packaging, etc.

　　Santai County is rich in the five raw materials of thatching grass, cotton, and hemp. Calculated on the basis of an annual output of 10 million jin of thatching grass and 1.5 million jin of cotton and hemp in the whole county, approximately more than 9 million jin of man-made fiber can be produced.

    五种人造纤维
    四川省三台县供销合作社利用棉麻（棉秆皮）、蓑草、稻草、芭蕉树皮、构树皮等五种原料，用人工操作试制成五种人造纤维。试制成功的这些人造纤维，经省工业厅鉴定，认为质量好，可以大量地制造。
    这些人造纤维可以分别用来织毯子、花布、白布、帆布、袜子、蚊帐、手套、毛巾、麻袋。芭蕉纤维还可以做价值较高的卡叽，稻草纤维可以做棉絮。上述各种纤维如果用来做衣料，都需要加30％—40％原棉。不加原棉，可以用以做包装等用布。
    三台县盛产蓑草、棉麻等五种原料。全县以年产一千万斤蓑草、一百五十万斤棉麻计算，大约可以制出九百多万斤人造纤维。
