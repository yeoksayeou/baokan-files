Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: Washington Dispatch: US President Eisenhower, at a press conference on the 5th, answered questions raised by reporters regarding the prospects of holding an East-West summit. In his responses, he continued to adopt a cold-water-pouring attitude towards holding such a meeting.

A reporter asked Eisenhower whether, given the several exchanges of letters between him and Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, he believed this had promoted understanding between the US and the USSR and increased the possibility of holding a summit. Eisenhower gave a negative answer to this question. He said that he did not currently believe there was "real factual basis" to draw "definitely favorable conclusions" regarding these two questions.

Amidst the rising global calls for a summit, Eisenhower dared not completely close the door to talks but continued to prevaricate and delay. He said that the US government is now engaged in "intense work," and that he would be studying with Secretary of State Dulles to see if they could propose "persuasive possible approaches" which, with "appropriate preparation," might lead to the convening of "a meeting of some nature."

Eisenhower stated that the US still insisted on holding a foreign ministers' meeting first to discuss substantive issues and stipulated that the summit must "have hope of reaching agreement." He also reiterated the eight points he proposed in his reply to Bulganin, including the requirement that the summit discuss the German question and the issue of "peaceful use of outer space."

When a reporter asked about the plan proposed by Poland to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, Eisenhower replied that it was "completely unimaginable" for the US to say how to handle this issue, that the US must proceed "very cautiously," and that it must "fully consider" the Atlantic Alliance. He said that the US "must never propose a one-sided suggestion that we withdraw (from Europe), or advocate that we demilitarize all of Central Europe."

### 要求东西方谈判呼声日益高涨  美国总统还在泼冷水

　　要求东西方谈判呼声日益高涨
    美国总统还在泼冷水
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔5日在记者招待会上就举行东西方最高级会议的前景问题回答了记者们向他提出的一些问题，他在回答中对举行这样一次会议继续采取泼冷水的态度。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，鉴于苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和他已经有数次书信往来，他是否认为已经促进了美苏两国的谅解和增加了举行一次最高级会议的可能性。艾森豪威尔对这个问题作了否定的回答。他说，他目前还不认为有“真正的事实根据”可以得出关于这两个问题的“确实有利的结论”。
    在全世界要求举行最高级会议的呼声日益高涨的情况下，艾森豪威尔不敢完全关死举行会谈的大门，而继续搪塞拖延。他说，美国政府现在正在进行“紧张的工作”，他将要和国务卿杜勒斯研究一下，看看是不是能够提出“具有说服力的可能做法”，以便“在适当的准备下”可能导致“某种性质的会议”的召开。
    艾森豪威尔表示美国仍然坚持先举行外长会议来讨论实质问题，并且规定最高级会议要“有达成协议的希望”。他还重申了他给布尔加宁的复信中提出的八点建议，其中包括要求最高级会议讨论德国问题以及“和平利用外层空间”问题。
    当记者问到波兰提出的在中欧建立无原子武器区的计划时，艾森豪威尔回答说，要美国来说如何处理这个问题是“完全不可想像的”，美国要“十分谨慎地进行”，要“充分考虑到”大西洋联盟。他说，美国“绝不要提出一个片面的建议主张我们退出（欧洲），或者主张我们把整个中欧非军事化”。
