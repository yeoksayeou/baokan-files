Xinhua News Agency, February 25th - The Paris-based "International Forum" weekly recently published a Latin American dispatch by John Hill, pointing out that a new demand for independence from the United States is evident throughout Latin America. A nationalism imbued with a strong anti-colonialist spirit has indeed become quite noticeable in Latin America. On the part of various governments, this tendency is manifested in taking various measures to diversify the foreign relations of Latin American countries while weakening Washington's control.

The article stated that the fundamental factor prompting Latin American countries to try to resist the United States is the increasingly widespread belief that the entire world situation has changed with the launch of the Soviet artificial satellites. Under the glow of the Soviet moon, Latin Americans see Washington's heavy-handed political and military practices as outdated.

The article also pointed out that the serious economic difficulties experienced by most Latin American countries in recent months are also one of the reasons why Latin Americans are seeking new ways to mitigate the harmful effects of the United States on Latin America.

For example, Mexican presidential candidate Adolfo López Mateos recently criticized the United States in a speech for "buying cheap and selling dear" in foreign trade, which has deepened the economic and foreign exchange reserve difficulties of all Latin American countries that rely on exporting raw materials to the United States. He said that the recent drop in prices of non-ferrous metals and other raw materials has made these countries realize once again that their almost complete dependence on the United States in foreign trade may have disastrous consequences for their economies.

In Brazil, business leaders advocate trade with the Soviet Union, believing that Brazil must find new markets.

In Chile, the decline in copper prices and the resulting domestic market depression have prompted people to consider expanding trade with the Soviet Union.

Similarly, Uruguay is seeking markets for its wool and agricultural products in Eastern Europe, especially after its wool exports to the United States were obstructed by American wool merchants, making this demand even more urgent.

In Argentina, an Argentine delegation headed by Undersecretary of Industry and Commerce Ondarts is visiting the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to negotiate the expansion of trade with these countries.

The United States' practice of using the fictitious "communist danger" as intimidation to keep Latin American countries in tow is also gradually failing. Recently, a foreign reporter asked López Mateos how he viewed the issue of defending the Americas against communism. Mateos replied, "We know our own problems; you take care of your own business!"

### 东风吹醒了拉丁美洲  许多国家渴望挣脱美国枷锁

    东风吹醒了拉丁美洲
    许多国家渴望挣脱美国枷锁
    新华社25日讯　巴黎“国际论坛”周刊最近刊载约翰·希尔写的一篇拉丁美洲通讯指出，拉丁美洲到处都表现出希望对美国保持独立的新要求。带着强烈的反殖民主义气息的民族主义在拉丁美洲确实已经十分明显地觉醒了。从各国政府方面说，这种倾向的表现是采取种种措施使得拉丁美洲国家对外关系多种多样，同时削弱华盛顿的控制。
    文章说，促使拉丁美洲各国设法抵制美国的根本因素是：人们日益普遍地认为，整个世界形势随着苏联人造卫星的发射而起了变化。在苏联月亮的照耀下，拉丁美洲人认为华盛顿在政治上和军事上的生硬作法是过时了。
    文章还指出，几个月来，拉丁美洲大多数国家的经济困难严重化也是促使拉丁美洲人谋求新的办法来减轻美国对拉丁美洲的有害影响的原因之一。
    例如，墨西哥总统候选人阿道夫·洛佩兹·马特奥斯不久以前在谈话中指责美国在对外贸易上“贱买贵卖”，使所有靠对美国输出原料的拉丁美洲国家在经济和外汇储备上加深了困难。他说，由于最近几个月来有色金属和其他原料价格的下跌，使这些国家再次认识到它们在对外贸易上几乎完全是以美国为中心的情况，可能对它们的经济突然产生灾难性的后果。
    在巴西，企业界领导人士主张同苏联贸易，他们认为巴西必须寻找新的市场。
    在智利，铜的价格的降低和因此造成的国内市场萧条，促使人们打算扩大对苏联贸易。
    同样，乌拉圭正在东欧为它的羊毛和农产品谋求市场，特别是在它对美国的羊毛输出受到美国羊毛商的阻挠之后这种要求更为迫切。
    在阿根廷，以工商部副部长翁达尔茨为首的阿根廷代表团正在访问苏联和东欧国家，谈判扩大同这些国家的贸易问题。
    美国用虚构的“共产主义危险”作恫吓来拉着拉丁美洲国家跟它走的作法也逐渐失灵了。最近有外国记者向洛佩兹·马特奥斯问到，他对美洲防御共产主义问题怎样看法。马特奥斯回答说：“我们自己的问题，我们自己知道，你们去管你们的事吧！”
