Talking About Red Beans on the 25th of the Twelfth Lunar Month
Yang Min

According to historical records, every household in ancient times would make red bean porridge to eat on the 25th of the twelfth lunar month. Ancient people believed that eating red bean porridge on this day would drive away evil spirits, ensure abundant crops, and bring health and peace in the coming year. Therefore, everyone ate it with hope, even babies, cats, and dogs were fed a little, and a portion was left for travelers who had not yet returned home. This is the custom of eating "kou mi porridge," which, although steeped in superstition, does have health benefits due to the many valuable properties of red beans.

One function of red beans is to clear toxins. In ancient times, red bean powder mixed with water or wine was often used to apply to various carbuncles, boils, and sores, and it was said to be effective. In the Compendium of Materia Medica, there are also records of using red bean powder as a topical application to cure mumps (i.e., parotitis) and back boils, which is worth our attention.

In addition, according to ancient medical books, red beans have many other functions such as strengthening the stomach, promoting salivation, removing dampness, benefiting qi, promoting urination, and quenching thirst. Therefore, many families are accustomed to cooking red bean porridge to eat during the hot summer and autumn days; cold food stores in large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin also specially prepare red bean porridge for sale. It can indeed clear heat and quench thirst.

Through modern scientific analysis, we know that red beans contain a very rich amount of vitamin B1 (second only to brown rice in content), so eating more can prevent and treat beriberi (and this, our ancestors had already discovered and used). We also know that the phosphorus and calcium content in red beans is about the same as that in white rice, but the iron content is about five times that of white rice, and the protein content is more than twice that of white rice. From this point alone, we can see its nutritional value.

It is said that nursing mothers who eat red bean porridge can also promote lactation. The Compendium of Materia Medica quotes "Chen Ziming's Formulas for Women": "My wife was a vegetarian, and seven days after giving birth, the milk ducts were not flowing. Medication was ineffective. By chance, she obtained a liter of red beans and cooked porridge to eat. That night, the milk flowed." How exactly this works is still worth studying.

Song Dynasty Fan Chengda's "Kou Shu Porridge Song" poem contains the line: "Every household on the twenty-fifth of the twelfth month, sifts rice like pearls and cooks with beans,... shaves ginger and cassia sprinkles cane sugar, slippery and sweet beyond compare to yellow millet." Indeed, red beans themselves are already fragrant and delicious. Mixed into porridge or rice, and with the addition of condiments, it will make people eat with relish.

    腊月廿五话赤豆
    杨旻
    据史籍记载，古时每逢腊月二十五，家家户户都要做赤豆粥吃。古人相信，这天吃了赤豆粥，疫鬼便会远逃，谷物便会丰美，来年就可以康乐平安了。因此，人人满怀希望地去吃它，连婴儿，甚至猫儿、狗儿，也要喂吃一点，还要留一份给在外未归的行人。这就是所谓吃“口敉粥”的风俗，虽然迷信的色彩非常浓厚，但由于赤豆具有许多可贵的功用，却病健身的效果也不是没有的。
    赤豆的一种功用是清毒。在古代，对于各种痈疽疮肿，多有用赤豆粉末和水或酒来涂敷的，据说效果良好。在本草纲目中，还记载了用赤豆为末外敷治愈痄腮（即今腮腺炎）、发背等病的故事，这很值得我们重视。
    此外，据古代医书的记载，赤豆还有健胃、生津、去湿、益气、利尿、解渴等许多作用。因而，在夏秋炎热的日子，许多人家习惯于煮赤豆粥吃；北京、天津等大城市的冷食店，还特备赤豆粥出卖。它确实能清暑解渴。
    经过现代科学的化验，我们知道赤豆含有非常丰富的维生素B1（仅次于糙米的含量），因而多吃了能预防和治疗脚气病（而这点，我们的祖先也早已发现和运用了）。我们还知道，赤豆中磷和钙的含量约同白米中的含量差不多，但含的铁量约相当于白米中的五倍，蛋白质的含量相当于白米中的二倍多。从这一点上，也足见它的营养价值了。
    据说，哺乳的母亲吃了赤豆粥还能通乳。本草纲目引“陈自明妇人良方”云：“予妇食素，产后七日，乳脉不行，服药无效，偶得赤小豆一升，煮粥食之，当夜遂行。”究竟如何，还值得研究。
    宋朝范成大的“口数粥行”诗中有句云：“家家腊月二十五，淅米如珠和豆煮，……锼姜屑桂浇蔗糖，滑甘无比胜黄粱。”的确，赤豆本身已经清香可口，掺入粥或饭中，再加上佐料，是会叫人吃得津津有味的。
