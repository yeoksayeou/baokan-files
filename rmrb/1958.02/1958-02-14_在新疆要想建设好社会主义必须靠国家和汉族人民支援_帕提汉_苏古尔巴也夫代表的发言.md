At this meeting, we heard and extensively discussed Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the Implementation of the 1957 National Budget and the Draft 1958 National Budget," Vice Premier Bo Yibo's "Report on the Draft 1958 National Economic Plan," Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director Wu Yuzhang's report "On the Current Work of Language Reform and the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme." These reports play a promoting role in further developing China's socialist construction and further improving the happy life of all ethnic groups, and helping all minority nationalities absorb advanced knowledge and improve their own national culture. I express my complete support and resolute implementation. Like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, are fighting with full confidence to victoriously complete the Second Five-Year Plan and build a powerful socialist motherland with modernized industry, modernized agriculture, and modernized science and culture.

Xinjiang is an Inseparable Part of the Motherland and Must Always Be With the People of All Ethnic Groups in the Motherland

Since the Central Committee issued instructions on carrying out rectification and socialist education among minority nationalities, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has launched a great debate on the two roads in rural areas in addition to carrying out rectification among cadres in government agencies, factories, and mines, combined with cracking down on illegal landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements; carried out extensive socialist education in pastoral areas, and according to the instructions of the Central Committee, the Autonomous Region Party Committee is holding an enlarged meeting to carry out the struggle against local nationalism. Due to the victorious development of rectification, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the anti-local nationalism struggle, the socialist political consciousness of cadres and the broad masses of all ethnic groups and their understanding of accelerating socialist construction have been increasing day by day, thereby stimulating unlimited production enthusiasm. Whether in industry, agriculture, or animal husbandry, the production upsurge is advancing wave after wave, with victory following victory. In particular, the upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in rural areas is even more magnificent. In recent months, a daily renewed production upsurge has appeared in every corner of the Autonomous Region. All ethnic groups have realized that the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the unified motherland, and must always live together with the people of all ethnic groups in the big family of the motherland, and jointly strive to build a prosperous and strong socialist motherland.

Remarkable Achievements in Industrial and Agricultural Production

In terms of industry: The total industrial output value of the Autonomous Region in 1957 reached 440.26 million yuan, an increase of 52 percent over 1956. Among them, the total output value of local industry was 287 million yuan, an increase of 114 percent over 1956. On the basis of the victory of rectification, amazing achievements have emerged on the industrial production front. For example, the October Automobile Repair Factory completed the First Five-Year Plan half a year ahead of schedule, with an annual output 7.2 times higher than in 1956. The Dushanzi Oilfield completed 55 percent of its plan in thirteen days of drilling in January, and oil extraction completed 54 percent of its plan in ten days. There are many such vivid examples.

In terms of agriculture: In 1957, the cultivated land area of ​​the Autonomous Region reached 25.73 million mu, the total grain output was 4.0068 billion jin, the total cotton output was 1.02 million dan, and the total oil output was 145.2 million jin. We originally planned to increase the cultivated land area to 30.4 million mu in 1958, the total grain output to 4.585 billion jin, the total cotton output to 1.4776 million dan, and the total oil crops to 178.19 million jin. However, judging from the situation of the great leap forward in rural production brought about by the rectification upsurge, our plan is indeed a bit conservative. The cultivated land area in the whole region has quickly increased from the originally proposed 1.7 million mu to more than 2.5 million mu. In 1957, the yield per unit area of ​​grain and cotton in six agricultural cooperatives in Kashgar Prefecture and the Makit Mechanized Farm exceeded the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). In the past, people were still skeptical about whether the Autonomous Region could "cross the Yellow River." However, now "crossing the Yellow River" and "crossing the Yangtze River" have become the battle slogans of farmers of all ethnic groups. Now five agricultural cooperatives have planned to "cross the Yangtze River" in grain yield this year, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. The grain yield in Miqan, Changji, and Bachu counties will exceed 400 jin. During the rectification, the Jinggangshan Cooperative in Sandao Township, Miqan County, increased the originally planned rice yield of 802 jin per mu to 910.3 jin. In 1957, more than 40 cotton-growing counties in the Autonomous Region reached the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program, with a yield of 40, 60, and 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Turpan, Shanshan, Toksun, Kuqa, Bachu, Makit, and other counties plan to average 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year.

Thousands of Troops and Horses Build Water Conservancy Projects on Both Sides of the Tianshan Mountains; Blizzards Can't Stop the Burning Hearts of Young People

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is a vast area with abundant resources and a sparse population. The saying "where there is water, there is land" is still circulating today. Encouraged by the great leap forward in agricultural production, a high tide of water conservancy construction by thousands of troops and horses has unfolded on both sides of the Tianshan Mountains. In 1958, the whole region will build and renovate a total of 991 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects. After completion this spring, in addition to ensuring the water supply for the existing 28 million mu of cultivated land in the whole region, the irrigated area can also be expanded by more than 3.14 million mu, more than double the 1.35 million mu proposed in October 1957. These projects not only demonstrate the production enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups, but also show many heroic deeds. More than 50,000 young and middle-aged farmers and thousands of government cadres in Hotan Prefecture have invested in water conservancy construction sites. As of the end of December 1957, four reservoirs and three canals have been built, which can irrigate 200,500 mu of land. The number of laborers at the Aksu Reservoir construction site in Shule County has increased from 8,000 to 12,000. After a month of intense construction, the expansion task of 240,000 cubic meters of earthwork has been basically completed. 15,000 people in Yecheng County participated in the construction of the Cangren Reservoir, and proposed to complete the task in 70 days. More than 5,000 farmers in WenSu County participate in the construction of the 17-kilometer-long Tailang River diversion canal every day. People are digging earth day and night. The task of 20 days was completed in 15 days, and it is expected to be completed and released in early March, which can irrigate more than 400,000 mu of cultivated land. The Urumqi Youth Canal is 32 kilometers and 393 meters long, and the project is quite large and arduous. It requires 520,774 cubic meters of earthwork and 274,714 cubic meters of stonework, requiring a total of 753,179 workdays. In order to respond to the Party's call to vigorously develop water conservancy, the youths of all ethnic groups in government agencies, troops, and schools in Urumqi City accepted this glorious task with voluntary labor, saving the country 2 million yuan. Construction began on December 10, 1957. As of January 24 this year, one-quarter of the entire project has been completed in one and a half months, including 140,000 cubic meters of earthwork and 70,000 cubic meters of stonework. 12,000 people have participated in the labor. The construction site is located at the northern foot of the Tianshan Mountains, and the climate is usually around minus 20 degrees Celsius, sometimes reaching more than minus 30 degrees Celsius. The stratum is generally frozen by 30 to 50 centimeters. There are often heavy snowstorms (level 8 or above), but the wind, snow, severe cold cannot stop the young people's burning hearts for building a socialist motherland. The labor also made them deeply realize the greatness of labor and the greatness of the working people. For example, Comrade Zhang Shiwen from the Engineering Office of the Corps said: "Through this labor, I truly realized the greatness of the working people. We did our best to complete only three cubic meters, while the worker comrades created a record of 17 or 8 cubic meters (some young workers of the Corps participated in voluntary labor). I used to think that I was a knowledgeable person, but it was not as reasonable as the workers thought to build cobblestones." Comrade Chen Zhenghui (female), a member of the Communist Youth League of the Corps, originally agreed to get married on December 15. When the date was approaching, many people persuaded her to go back. She said: "Marriage is a personal matter, and the canal construction project is related to the interests of the masses." She resolutely wrote to her lover to postpone the marriage. Comrade Tuo Erde, a cadre of the Third District of Urumqi, had a fingernail knocked off by a stone and plunged into the flesh. The doctor told him to return to his original unit for treatment as soon as possible. He said: "This hand is not working, there is another hand." So he continued to work with one hand. Comrade Kurban from the Transportation Bureau, when he saw a large stone rolling down from the slope, he was afraid of hurting others, so he bravely used his body to block it, and was injured as a result. The doctor told him to rest. He said: "Is it okay not to work? Even if I can't lift it, I still have to shovel." Their slogans are "minor injuries do not leave the front line, serious injuries do not complain," "learn from Paul," "not afraid of bone-chilling cold, not bowing to difficulties."

The Production and Construction Corps Plays a Demonstration and Promoting Role; the Manure Accumulation Movement Unfolds Like Overturning Mountains and Seas

Before liberation, farmers of all ethnic groups were not very accustomed to accumulating and applying fertilizer. After the People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, it played a demonstration and promoting role in agricultural production. Farmers of all ethnic groups gradually realized the importance of fertilizing farmland. After the great debate in rural areas, the manure accumulation movement also unfolded with the momentum of overturning mountains and seas. Regardless of men, women, old or young, they all participated in the manure accumulation movement. Sheep manure buried in the mountains for many years was excavated. This year, the Autonomous Region plans to accumulate 40 billion jin of fertilizer. According to statistics from Hotan, Aksu, Hami, Urumqi, Changji, and Kezilesu prefectures and autonomous prefectures alone, 40.39 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, with an average application of 3,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, exceeding the original plan. Under the influence of the local Party and government leaders sitting in command and personally doing it (for example, the two county party secretaries of Kuqa accumulated 4,000 jin of fertilizer, the branch secretary of the Sixty Households Township of Heshuo accumulated 20,000 jin, and the deputy branch secretary accumulated 30,000 jin), most of the government cadres and urban residents in most areas also set off a high tide of accumulating and contributing fertilizer to support agricultural production. In November 1957, the government cadres in Hami City accumulated more than 540,000 jin of fertilizer, and the cadres in Qitai County have accumulated more than 1 million jin. Three neighborhood committees in the First District of Yining City accumulated 2 million jin of fertilizer in one day on November 24, 1957. Thirteen religious figures in Keping County also actively participated in the manure accumulation campaign, accumulating 48,000 jin of fertilizer in twelve days.

Streamlining of institutions and transferring cadres to lower levels are proceeding smoothly (the region plans to transfer 50,000 to 60,000 cadres to lower levels). The unified purchase and sale of grain and the planned supply of cotton cloth are also being implemented in the same way as in the rest of the country, and have been warmly welcomed and supported by people of all ethnic groups. Starting from January 1958, the unreasonable parts of the salaries of government cadres have been adjusted, so the country can save about 10 million yuan this year. Significant results have also been achieved in strictly practicing increasing production and practicing economy and opposing extravagance and waste.

Xinjiang is Vast and Rich in Resources, with a Small Population; All Construction Must Rely on the Help of the Han People

Like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the people of all ethnic groups in our Autonomous Region have the confidence and determination to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural and industrial production in 1958. In agriculture, with the rectification and the great debate on the two roads, farmers of all ethnic groups not only distinguished right from wrong and resolutely took the socialist road, but also ushered in an unprecedented production upsurge. In addition, more than 90% of the Autonomous Region is irrigated land, there is a lot of arable land that can be cultivated to expand the cultivated land area, and water resources are abundant. Therefore, agriculture has great potential. In terms of industry, the existing factories and mines have great production potential. As long as the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers is continuously improved, production can be greatly increased. This year, the central government implemented the division of financial powers in autonomous regions. In addition, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will be laid to Hami this year. All these favorable conditions will undoubtedly greatly promote the great leap forward in local industry in the Autonomous Region. In addition, the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region deeply realize that our Autonomous Region is vast and rich in resources, with a small population. To build socialism well, we must rely on the support and help of the country and the Han people in terms of financial resources, materials, and human resources. Our main task now is to prepare conditions for the upcoming large-scale industrial construction. The patriotic health campaign is even more urgently needed in minority areas and should be seriously implemented, especially in pastoral areas. Carrying out the struggle against local nationalism in minority ethnic groups in combination with rectification and anti-Rightist is a major task for the Autonomous Region's party and government and people of all ethnic groups this year. Without doing a good job in the ideological work of opposing local nationalism, it is impossible to successfully carry out socialist construction. Because these national scum, wearing the cloak of safeguarding national interests, carry out conspiracies against the Party, the people, and socialism. They propose to establish a "Union Republic" and establish "Uyghurstan," attempting to split the unification of the motherland and undermine national unity. Only by cleansing these national scum from our revolutionary ranks and completely exposing their ugly faces in front of the people of all ethnic groups can socialist construction progress more rapidly and can we consolidate the great achievements of our socialist construction. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will definitely unite more closely, arouse revolutionary vigor, and, together with the people of the whole country, ride the wind and waves and fight to the end for the construction of a strong socialist motherland!

    在新疆要想建设好社会主义必须靠国家和汉族人民支援
    帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫代表的发言
    在这次会议上，听到并广泛地讨论了李先念副总理“关于一九五七年国家预算执行情况和一九五八年国家预算草案的报告”，薄一波副总理“关于一九五八年度国民经济计划草案的报告”，彭真副委员长关于人大常委的工作报告，吴玉章主任“关于当前文字改革工作和汉语拼音方案”的报告。这些报告对进一步发展我国社会主义建设事业和进一步改善各族人民幸福生活、帮助各少数民族吸收先进知识、提高本民族的文化方面都起着推动作用。我表示完全拥护并坚决贯彻执行。新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民与全国人民一样，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，信心百倍地为胜利地完成第二个五年计划和建设现代化的工业，现代化的农业，现代化的科学文化的强大的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
    新疆是祖国不可分割的一部分要永远和祖国各族人民在一起
    自从中央发出关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育的指示后，新疆维吾尔自治区除在机关干部、厂矿企业中进行整风外在农村中开展了大鸣大放的两条道路的大辩论，结合打击了不法地、富和反、坏分子；在牧区进行广泛的社会主义教育，并根据中央指示，自治区党委正在召开扩大会议进行反对地方民族主义的斗争。由于整风、反右派、反地方民族主义的胜利的开展，各族干部和广大群众社会主义的政治觉悟，和加速社会主义建设的认识日益提高，从而，激发了无限的生产热情。无论在工业、农业、畜牧业方面，生产高潮是一浪赶一浪，胜利接着胜利前进。特别是在农村兴修水利和积肥高潮更是波澜壮阔。几个月来，在自治区的每个角落里都出现了日日新又日新的生产高潮。各族人民都认识到新疆维吾尔自治区是统一的祖国不可分割的一部分，要永远的和祖国大家庭中各族人民生活在一起，共同为建设一个繁荣富强的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
    工农业生产取得惊人成就
    在工业方面：自治区一九五七年工业产量总值达到四亿四千零二十六万元，比一九五六年增加百分之五十二。其中地方工业总产值二亿八千七百万元，比一九五六年增加百分之一百一十四。在整风胜利的基础上，在工业生产战线上，出现了惊人的成就。如：十月汽车修配厂提前半年完成了第一个五年计划，年产量比一九五六年增加了七点二倍。独山子石油矿区元月份打井，在十三天中，完成了计划的百分之五十五，石油开采，在十天中，完成了计划的百分之五十四，像这样生动的事例是很多的。
    在农业方面：一九五七年自治区耕地面积达到二千五百七十三万亩，粮食总产量四十亿零六百八十万斤，棉花总产量一百零二万担，油料总产量一亿四千五百二十万斤。我们原计划一九五八年耕地面积要求达到三千零四十万亩，粮食总产量四十五亿八千五百万斤，棉花总产量一百四十七万七千六百担，油料作物一百七十八万一千九百担。但从整改高潮带来农村生产大跃进的情况看，我们的计划确实有些保守了，全区的开荒面积已由原来提出的一百七十多万亩很快地增加到二百五十多万亩。一九五七年喀什专区六个农业社和麦盖提机耕农场粮棉单位面积产量，已超过农业发展纲要（修正草案）的指标。过去人们对于自治区能否“跨黄河”还有怀疑。但是，现在“跨黄河”、“渡长江”已成了各族农民的战斗口号。现在已有五个农业社今年粮食产量要“渡过长江”，亩产一千斤，米泉、昌吉、巴楚三县的粮食产量要超过四百斤，米泉县三道坝乡井岗山社在整改中把原订亩产水稻八百零二斤提高到九百一十点三斤。自治区一九五七年有四十多个植棉县已达到全国农业发展纲要亩产皮棉四十、六十、八十斤指标以上。吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊、库车、巴楚、麦盖提等县，今年计划平均亩产皮棉一百斤。
    天山南北千军万马兴修水利  暴风雪挡不住青年火热的心
    新疆维吾尔自治区是个地大物博、人口稀少地区，“有水就有地”的民谚迄今还在流传。随着农业生产大跃进的鼓舞，在天山南北展开了千军万马兴修水利的高潮。全区一九五八年兴修和整修的中小型水利工程共有九百九十一项，今春完工后，除保证全区现有的二千八百万亩耕地用水外，还可扩大灌溉面积三百一十四万余亩。比一九五七年十月提出的一百三十五万亩增加一倍以上。在这些工程中既表现了各族人民生产热情，又出现了许多英雄事迹。和阗专区五万多青壮年农民和成千名机关干部投入水利工地，至一九五七年十二月底止已建成了四个水库和三条水渠，可灌溉二十万零五千亩地，疏勒县阿克斯水库工地劳动民工已由八千人增加到一万二千人，经过一个月的紧张施工已基本完成了二十四万土方的扩建任务。叶城县参加修建仓仁水库的民工有一万五千人，提出在七十天内完成任务。温宿县每天参加修建长达十七公里的太浪河引水渠的农民有五千多人，人们日夜不停的挖土方，二十天的任务，十五天就完成了，预计三月初即竣工放水，可灌溉耕地四十多万亩。乌鲁木齐青年渠全长三十二公里三百九十三公尺，工程相当宏大艰巨，需要填挖土方五十二万零七百七十四方，石方二十七万四千七百一十四方，共需劳动日七十五万三千一百七十九个工日。为了响应党的大力发展水利号召，乌鲁木齐市区机关、部队、学校的各族青年用义务劳动来接受了这项光荣任务。为国家节省二百万元。一九五七年十二月十日开始修建，至今年元月二十四日止，在一个半月的时间里已完成全部工程的四分之一，计土方十四万方，石方七万方。已有一万二千人参加了劳动。工地在天山北麓，气候平常在零下二十度左右，有时达到零下三十多度。地层一般结冻三十至五十公分。常有大雪暴风（八级以上），但风雪严寒阻挡不了青年们建设社会主义祖国的火热的心。在劳动中又深深使他们更加体会到劳动的伟大、劳动人民的伟大。如兵团工程处张石文同志说：“通过这次劳动，我真正认识到劳动人民的伟大。我们尽了最大的力量，只能完成三方，而工人同志却创造了十七、八方的纪录，（兵团部分青年工人参加义务劳动）过去以为自己是有知识的人，但砌起卵石来就不如工人想的合理。”兵团共青团员陈正慧同志（女），原来约定在十二月十五日结婚，临期许多人劝她回去，她说：“结婚是个人私事，修渠工程是关系着群众的利益。”毅然给其爱人去信，延期结婚。乌鲁木齐三区干部托尔地同志被石头打掉手指甲，陷入肉内，医生嘱其速回原单位治疗，他说：“这只手不行了，还有另一只手呢。”就这样他用一只手劳动下去。运输局库尔班同志，当他看见一块大石头从坡上滚下时，他怕伤着别人，自己奋勇用身体去挡住，结果受了伤，医生让他休息，他说：“不劳动还行吗？即使不能抬了，我也要铲。”他们的口号是“轻伤不下火线，重伤不叫苦”，“向保尔学习”，“不怕寒冷刺骨，不向困难低头”。
    生产部队起示范推动作用  积肥运动如排山倒海展开
    解放前各族农民对于积肥施肥不大习惯，人民解放军进疆后，在农业生产上起了示范推动作用。各族农民逐渐了解到农田施肥的重要。经过农村大辩论后，积肥运动也以排山倒海之势在开展起来了。无论男女老幼都参加了积肥运动，多少年埋没在山中的羊肥被挖掘出来了，今年自治区计划积肥四百亿斤。现只据和阗、阿克苏、哈密、乌鲁木齐、昌吉、克孜勒苏专区、自治州统计，已积肥四百零三点九亿斤，平均每亩可施肥三千至五千斤，已超过原订计划。在地方党政负责同志坐镇指挥、亲自动手的影响下，（如库车两个县委书记积肥四千斤，和硕六十户乡支书积肥两万斤，副支书积肥三万斤），绝大部分地区的机关干部、城镇居民也都掀起了积肥、献肥，支援农业生产的高潮。哈密市区机关干部在一九五七年十一月份内积肥五十四万多斤，奇台县干部已积肥一百多万斤，伊宁市一区三个居民委员会在一九五七年十一月二十四日一天内就积肥二百万斤。柯坪县十三个宗教人士也积极参加积肥行列，在十二天内也积肥四万八千斤。
    精简机构下放干部正在顺利进行（全区计划下放干部五万至六万人）粮食统购统销和棉布计划供应也同全国一样的实行了，并得到各族人民热烈地欢迎和支持。从一九五八年一月开始，调整了国家机关干部工资的不合理部分，因而国家今年即可少开支约一千万元。厉行增产节约、反对铺张浪费也获得了显著成效。
    新疆地大物博人口不多  各项建设要靠汉族帮助
    我们自治区各族人民同全国人民一样有信心有决心争取一九五八年在农业、工业生产上的大跃进。在农业方面随着整风整社和两条道路的大辩论，各族农民不但明辨是非，坚决走社会主义道路，而且出现了史无前例的生产高潮，加之自治区有百分之九十以上是水浇田，可垦耕地很多可以扩大耕地面积，水利资源丰富，因而农业方面具有极大的潜力。在工业方面，现有厂矿的生产潜力很大，只要继续提高广大职工的生产热情，就能大大增产。今年中央实行了自治地方财政权限划分，加上兰新铁路本年内铺轨到哈密，所有这些有利条件，无疑地要大大促进自治区地方工业的大跃进。另外，自治区各族人民深切地认识到我们自治区地大物博，人口不多，要想建设好社会主义必须依靠国家和汉族人民在财力、物力和人力上的支援和帮助。我们现在的主要任务是为迎接即将到来的大规模工业建设准备条件。爱国卫生运动在少数民族地区更是迫切的需要，应当认真贯彻执行，特别是牧区更要大力开展。在少数民族中结合整风、反右派开展反对地方民族主义的斗争是自治区党政和各族人民今年一项重大任务，不做好反对地方民族主义这一思想工作，就不可能胜利地进行社会主义建设。因为这些民族败类，披着维护民族利益的外衣，进行反党反人民反社会主义的阴谋，他们提出成立“加盟共和国”成立“维吾尔斯坦”，企图分裂祖国统一，破坏民族团结。只有把这些民族败类从我们革命队伍中清洗出去，在各族人民面前把他们的丑恶面目完全暴露出来，才能使社会主义建设更迅速地向前进展，才能巩固我们社会主义建设的伟大成就。我们坚决相信新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，一定能更加亲密团结起来，鼓起革命干劲，与全国人民一道，乘风破浪的为强大的社会主义祖国建设奋斗到底！
