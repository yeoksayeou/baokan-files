Xinhua News Agency report:

To inherit cultural heritage and develop a new socialist culture, the State Council's Scientific Planning Committee established an Ancient Books Collation and Publication Planning Group.

Comrades Kang Sheng and Zhou Yang Made Important Speeches on the Principles of Collating and Publishing Ancient Books

Xinhua News Agency dispatch The Ancient Books Collation and Publication Planning Group of the State Council's Scientific Planning Committee held its inaugural meeting from the 9th to the 11th. More than ninety people attended, including members of the group, figures from academic and cultural circles, and personnel from relevant departments. Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting and delivered important speeches on the principles and methods of collating and publishing ancient books. The meeting focused on discussing the guiding principles and tasks of collating and publishing ancient books and formulating a long-term plan.

In their speeches, Kang Sheng and Zhou Yang both pointed out that the work of collating and publishing ancient books had been successful in the past few years, but the shortcomings were a lack of overall planning and a lack of clear objectives. It is necessary and timely to establish an Ancient Books Collation and Publication Planning Group under the State Council's Scientific Planning Committee to make overall considerations and arrangements for the principles and plans for collating and publishing ancient books.

They pointed out that the collation and publication of ancient books must implement Chairman Mao's guiding principle, as instructed in "On New Democracy," of clearing our cultural heritage with a critical attitude. Clearing our ancient cultural heritage is an important condition for establishing a new socialist culture. However, our attitude towards cultural heritage is fundamentally different from that of national essence advocates. We do not accept everything uncritically. We clear cultural heritage in order to inherit it and develop it. We collate and publish ancient books not because of infatuation with the past, but because of belief in the future, believing that there are things in ancient books that we need to build a socialist culture.

At the same time, they pointed out that the collation and publication of ancient books must implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Kang Sheng said that the collation of ancient books should involve contention among a hundred schools of thought, with great freedom of expression, from the selection of versions to the compilation of special collections, all of which should concentrate on various different opinions for discussion. Zhou Yang said that the collation of ancient books should require the unity of materials and viewpoints, and should be commanded by Marxism-Leninism. We require those who have mastered the materials to seriously study Marxism-Leninism, and we also require those who have Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to painstakingly master the materials. But this is not easy, and requires a difficult process of effort, requiring hard work for several years, or even more than ten years. If some people, although their Marxist-Leninist viewpoints are somewhat lacking, are able to make the materials accurate, that is also good. The accuracy of the materials is very important, and do not rush to judge the popular nature of a certain classical literature from fragmentary words and phrases, otherwise it will distort history. For some works, it may be considered to publish two versions: one is a selection of essences, prepared for the majority to read; the other is both essence and dross, prepared for a few to study and criticize. He said that there are not many old experts engaged in scholarship now, and they should be allowed to fully exert their strength and express different opinions.

Kang Sheng and Zhou Yang both believed that the collation and publication of ancient books must adopt the method of combining experts and the masses. Kang Sheng said that the collation and publication of ancient books should rely on experts, otherwise it will not work. But on the other hand, it is also necessary to rely on the strength of the masses. When experts and the masses are combined, things can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. At the same time, the publication of ancient books should consider the needs of both experts and the masses. There are also different experts, who must take into account the needs of both old experts and young people who are about to become experts. In short, it is necessary to take into account the needs of the majority of people.

Qi Yanming, the convener of the Ancient Books Collation and Publication Planning Group, explained the preparations for the group, the working tasks of the group, and the method of formulating a plan for collating and publishing ancient books. Regarding how to formulate a plan for collating and publishing ancient books, Qi Yanming said that our plan must be combined with objective needs, and the publication of ancient books must consider the target audience. The target audience for ancient books can be roughly divided into three categories: first, experts, for whom the main thing is to provide reference materials, and the standards can be broader. However, it is necessary to carefully select versions and publish them in order of priority and urgency. The number of copies should not be too large, and the distribution method should vary from book to book. The second is general researchers, for whom representative works of value in various aspects of history can be selected, and several sets of basic famous books series should be published systematically in literature, history, and philosophy. These books should be carefully selected versions and undergo more collation and processing work, and there must be a publication note in front. The third is general readers, who need to be carefully selected or compiled, with simple annotations, some of which also need to be translated into vernacular, and some books also need an introduction to reading methods.

Qi Yanming said that to formulate our plan well and realize our plan, we must combine with relevant research institutions and teaching institutions and mobilize experts from all aspects. He requested that the first drafts of the three plans for literature, history, and philosophy be drafted by the end of February and issued to all parties for comments. In March, the opinions will be collected, revised, and balanced, and efforts will be made to finalize the plan roughly in mid-April, and then published in relevant newspapers and periodicals to solicit opinions more widely.

At the meeting, Zheng Zhenduo, Jian Bozan, and Pan Zinian, the conveners of the three groups for literature, history, and philosophy, respectively, spoke on the progress and problems of the three groups' draft plans. Feng Youlan, Du Guoxiang, Xu Senyu, Wei Jiangong, Wu Han, Xing Zanting, Jin Zhaozhi, Zhang Shizhao, Ji Wenfu, and others also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously agreed to conduct planned collation and publication of ancient Chinese books, and put forward many good opinions on the collation and publication work.

    继承文化遗产　发展社会主义新文化
    科学规划委员会成立古籍整理出版规划小组
    康生和周扬同志对整理出版古籍的方针作了重要发言
    新华社讯　国务院科学规划委员会古籍整理出版规划小组在9日到11日召开了成立会议。出席的有小组成员、学术文化界人士和有关部门的人员共九十多人。中共中央政治局候补委员康生和中宣部副部长周扬出席了会议，对整理出版古籍的方针和作法作了重要的讲话。会议着重讨论了整理出版古籍的方针任务和制订长远规划的问题。
    康生、周扬在讲话中都指出，几年来古籍的整理和出版工作是有成绩的，缺点是缺乏通盘计划和目的不够明确。在国务院科学规划委员会下面设立一个古籍整理出版规划小组，对整理出版古籍的方针和计划作全盘的考虑和安排，是很必要和很及时的。
    他们指出，整理和出版古籍，必须贯彻毛主席在“新民主主义论”中所指示的用批判的态度清理我国文化遗产的方针。清理我国古代文化遗产是建立社会主义新文化的重要条件。但我们对待文化遗产的态度与国粹主义者根本不同，我们不是无批判的兼收并蓄。我们清理文化遗产，是为了继承它和发展它。我们整理和出版古籍，不是由于迷恋过去，而是由于相信将来，相信古籍中有为我们建设社会主义文化所需要的东西。
    同时他们指出，整理和出版古籍必须贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针。康生说，整理古籍要百家争鸣，大放大鸣，从选择版本一直到编选专集，都应该集中各种不同的意见，加以讨论。周扬说，整理古籍应该要求资料和观点的统一，要用马克思列宁主义作统帅。我们要求掌握了资料的人认真地学习马克思列宁主义，我们也要求有马克思列宁主义观点的人刻苦地掌握资料。但这是很不容易的，需要一个艰苦的努力过程，要苦战几年，甚至十几年。如有的人，马克思列宁主义观点虽差一些，但能够把资料搞得准确，也是好的。资料的准确性是很重要的，不要忙于从片言只字中来判断某一种古典文学的人民性，否则会歪曲历史。对于有些著作，可以考虑出版两种版本：一本是选编精华，准备给多数人看的；一本是精华糟粕都有，准备给少数人研究批判的。他说，现在搞学问的老专家不多，要让他们充分发挥力量，使他们发表不同的意见。
    康生、周扬都认为，整理和出版古籍必须采取专家与群众相结合的办法。康生说，整理出版古籍应该依靠专家，否则不行。但另一方面也要依靠群众的力量。专家和群众两方面相结合，事情就可以做得又多又快又好又省。同时，出版古籍要考虑专家和群众两方面的需要。专家也有不同，既要照顾老专家的需要，也要照顾将要作专家的青年人的需要。总之要照顾大多数人的需要。
    整理出版古籍规划小组的召集人齐燕铭对小组筹备经过、小组的工作任务和制订整理出版古籍计划的办法作了说明。关于如何制订整理出版古籍的计划，齐燕铭说，我们的计划必须与客观需要相结合，出版古书一定要考虑对象。古书的读者对象大体有三类：第一是专家，对于他们，主要是供给参考资料，标准可以宽一些。但要精选版本，分别先后缓急出版。印数不宜过多，发行的方法也因书而异。第二是一般研究工作者，对于他们，可以选择历史上各方面有价值的代表性著作，应有计划地就文学、史学、哲学分别出版几套基本名著丛书。这些书要精选版本，作较多的整理加工工作，前面必须有出版说明。第三是一般读者，就需要精选或编选，作浅明的注释，有的还要翻成白话，有些书还要作介绍阅读方法的序言。
    齐燕铭说，要制订好我们的计划，要实现我们的计划，必须与有关研究机构和教学机构结合，把各方面的专家动员起来。他要求在2月底把文、史、哲三个计划的初稿拟出来，印发各方面征求意见。3月间把意见收回来，进行修改、平衡，争取4月中旬把计划大体定下来，然后在有关报刊上发表，更广泛地征求意见。
    在会议上，文、史、哲三个分组的召集人郑振铎、翦伯赞、潘梓年分别就三个分组草拟计划的情况和问题作了发言。在会上发言的还有冯友兰、杜国庠、徐森玉、魏建功、吴晗、邢赞亭、金兆梓、章士钊、嵇文甫等，他们一致赞成对我国古籍进行有计划的整理和出版工作，并对整理和出版工作提出了许多好的意见。
