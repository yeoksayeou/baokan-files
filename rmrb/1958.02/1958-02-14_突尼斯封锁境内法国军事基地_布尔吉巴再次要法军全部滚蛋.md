Xinhua News Agency, February 13th, dispatch from Tunis: Tunisian President Bourguiba, at a press conference on the 12th, once again demanded that all French troops withdraw from Tunisia. He said that the most pressing issue facing Tunisia is to achieve victory in the struggle for the withdrawal of French troops and to eliminate the remnants of colonialism in the relations between France and Tunisia. He also stated that it is not yet time to restore relations between the two countries.

Bourguiba indicated that he intends to request weapons from the United States and Britain again.

Bourguiba held this press conference shortly after a large demonstration by the Tunisian people in front of the presidential palace, demanding the withdrawal of French troops. Demonstrators held large banners with slogans such as "All French troops out of Tunisia."

It is reported that the Tunisian authorities have adopted blockade and resistance measures against all French military bases within the country. All French military bases are isolated, and the supply of food and water is continuously decreasing, with the massive Bizerte naval base particularly hard hit. French troops are not allowed to leave any base.

Tunisian Foreign Minister Mokaddem, on the 12th, warned the French Chargé d'Affaires in Tunisia, Benard, regarding rumors that French warships were sailing to Bizerte to provide reinforcements, saying that if the French authorities attempt to undermine Tunisia's ban on French warships entering Bizerte, it will have serious consequences.

On the same day, a large anti-French demonstration with several thousand participants was held in Bizerte. Four thousand Tunisian workers working at the large French shipyard in Ferryville also refused to work for the French military.

The Tunisian government also notified the French government that anyone holding French military identification would not be allowed to enter Tunisian territory. The Tunisian authorities demanded that France close most of its consulates and ordered four hundred French people living in the Tunisian border region bordering Algeria to leave the area.

Tunisian patriots have decided to designate February 14th as "Sakiet Day" and called on the Tunisian people across the country to hold demonstrations nationwide to protest the barbaric French bombing.

According to the Tunisian authorities, the government is preparing to rebuild a new village near the ruins of the village of Sakiet, which was destroyed by French aircraft, as an indictment of the "Algerian War and colonialist atrocities."

    突尼斯封锁境内法国军事基地
    布尔吉巴再次要法军全部滚蛋
    据新华社13日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯总统布尔吉巴12日在记者招待会上发表谈话，再一次要求法军全部撤出突尼斯。他说，目前摆在突尼斯面前的最迫切的问题是：使争取法军撤退的斗争获得胜利和消除法国同突尼斯关系中的殖民主义残余。他还说，目前还不是恢复两国关系的时候。
    布尔吉巴表示，他打算再度请求美英两国提供武器。
    布尔吉巴是在突尼斯人民在总统府前举行大示威要求法军撤退之后不久举行这次记者招待会的。示威者举着大幅标语牌，上面写着“法军全部撤出突尼斯”等口号。
    据报道，突尼斯当局对境内全部法国军事基地采取了封锁和抵制措施，所有法国军事基地都陷于孤立，粮食和水的供应不断减少，规模巨大的比塞大海军基地所受打击特别严重。法军不准离开任何基地。
    突尼斯外交部长莫卡德姆12日就有关法国军舰正在驶往比塞大港增援的传闻向法国驻突尼斯临时代办贝纳尔提出警告说，法国当局如果企图破坏突尼斯不许法舰开进比塞大的禁令，将会引起严重后果。
    同一天，在比塞大举行了有几千人参加的反法大示威。在斐尔维勒的法军大型造船厂工作的四千突尼斯工人，也拒绝为法军工作。
    突尼斯政府还通知法国政府，任何持有法国军人证件的人都不得进入突尼斯国境。突尼斯当局要求法国关闭它大部分的领事馆，并且勒令住在同阿尔及利亚接壤的突尼斯边境地区的四百个法国人离开那里。
    突尼斯的爱国者已经决定把2月14日定为“萨基埃特日”，并且号召突尼斯全国人民这一天在全国各地举行示威以抗议法国的野蛮轰炸。
    据突尼斯当局宣布，政府准备在被法机炸毁的萨基埃特村的废墟附近重新建立一座新村庄，作为对“阿尔及利亚战争和殖民主义暴行”的控诉。
