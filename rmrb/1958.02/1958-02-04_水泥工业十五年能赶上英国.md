　　Cement Industry Can Catch Up with Britain in Fifteen Years
　　Jin Disan
　　The Party Central Committee has issued a great call to the people of the whole country—strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years.
　　This slogan is also a glorious and arduous task for the cement industry.
　　What is the current production level of the British cement industry? How many years will it take for China's cement industry to catch up with or surpass the production level of Britain? Let's briefly discuss this issue.
　　Britain is one of the earliest countries in the world to produce cement. As early as the end of the eighteenth century, Britain created the cement industry. In 1824, it obtained the patent right to produce modern cement (Portland cement) at that time. Up to now, the production level of the British cement industry has developed to an annual output of 12.9 million tons, ranking fourth in the world's cement production. Therefore, the British cement industry has a fairly high level.
　　The development of the British cement industry has gone through a long road. It can be roughly divided into three historical periods, starting from the eve of the First World War. The first period was from 1913 to 1939. In twenty-six years, the output increased by 1.86 times, an average annual increase of 4%. The main reason why the British cement industry was able to achieve such relatively stable development during this period was that after a world war, Britain and other imperialist countries survived the severe economic crisis and enabled capitalism to have new development and "prosperity," so the cement industry also received corresponding growth. There was a widespread and profound crisis in 1929-1933, but it seems that the cement industry was not greatly affected at that time. It began to recover the following year (1933-34) and reached the peak of production in 1939—an annual output of 8.34 million tons. Therefore, this period was a period of rise and development of the British cement industry.
　　However, after 1939, the capitalist world experienced another unprecedented and far-reaching economic crisis. Britain's industrial production shrank, and Britain was plunged into the vortex of the Second World War, which began in 1941. The war made Britain's economic imbalance more serious, causing chaos in the process of reproduction and throughout the economic life. Therefore, from that time on, the production of the British cement industry began to decline, especially in the later stages of the war, the decline was even greater. The output in 1945 was almost only half of the highest annual output before the war. It was not until 1948 that it recovered to the pre-war level. Therefore, between 1940 and 1948, the British cement industry was in a state of decline and stagnation. This is the second historical period of the British cement industry.
　　After 1948, the British cement industry entered the third historical period, namely the post-war development period. During this period, the development speed of the British cement industry was quite fast. In seven years, the output increased by half. The average annual growth rate reached 5%. This is much faster than the development speed of pig iron, steel, and coal in Britain during the same period.
　　In general, in the forty-three years from 1913 to 1956, the output of the British cement industry increased from 2.92 million tons to 12.9 million tons, an increase of 341%, an average annual increase of about 3.5%.
　　Why has the British cement industry been able to achieve such relatively rapid development in the post-war years? The main reasons are:
　　(1) Various departments of the national economy rebuilt and built a certain number of houses after the war;
　　(2) Due to the vigorous implementation of foreign economic expansion, exports increased;
　　(3) Due to the militarization of the national economy, military strategic industries and factory buildings increased.
　　Britain is a country that relies on exports and also a country that exports a large amount of cement. The export volume of cement has always been the first in the world. In the years after the war, Britain took advantage of the weakening of Germany, Japan, and Italy to use resources to compete for foreign markets, expand its sphere of influence, and increase export levels, and increased the export ratio from 22% of all products to 35% to 40%. The average annual export volume of cement also increased to 1.7 million to 1.8 million tons. In 1952, it increased to 2.06 million tons. The increase in export volume has enabled the British cement industry to maintain a relatively high production level.
　　In the post-war period, the total number of residential buildings in Britain was much lower than the pre-war level. However, due to the expansion of military strategic buildings and factory construction, the British construction industry has made great progress. The construction volume in 1953 increased by 7% compared with the previous year; there was another increase in 1953. Since the construction industry accounts for about 14% of the total industrial production, its increased production will inevitably stimulate the rise in cement industry production.
　　It is precisely because of these factors that the British cement industry can achieve an average annual increase of 5% after the war; however, these factors are gradually declining. The current situation is: the competition in the capitalist world market is becoming increasingly fierce. Since 1955, the situation of Britain being squeezed by West Germany and Japan has become more serious (in 1956, Japan's cement exports surpassed Britain and jumped to the first place in the world); domestically, new investments in military industrial sectors have been largely completed, and the stimulation of the militarization of the national economy to the British economy has become exhausted. Since the end of 1954, the economic contradictions in Britain have grown significantly, the civilian industry has turned from stagnation to decline, and the production of certain heavy industries is also deteriorating. As the British government has adopted a series of measures to reduce the living standards of the working people to find a way out, the investment in residential construction has also been reduced by 15%. Investment in the renovation and expansion of fixed capital has also begun to decline.... These have gradually reduced the speed of production increase in the British cement industry. For example, it increased by 6.5% in 1954 compared with 1953, 4.8% in 1955, and only 1.5% in 1956. Therefore, in the next few years, it will be quite difficult for the British cement industry production to reach a speed of 5%. For the convenience of calculation, we might as well still consider this number. In this way, it is estimated that by 1967, it will reach about 22 million tons, and by 1972, it will reach a production level of about 28.4 million tons.
　　Now let's talk about the situation of China's cement industry.
　　China's cement industry began in 1886 and has a history of seventy-one years, more than sixty years later than Britain. Therefore, it is still relatively young, and it was initially established by British merchants of the Kaiping Mining Bureau near the coal mine.
　　From the first day of its birth, China's cement industry has been suffering from imperialist economic aggression for half a century until the liberation. Before the end of the First World War, it was a period when foreign cement monopolized the domestic market, and the cement industry was suffocated from the beginning. Since then, in the twenty years from 1917 to 1937, due to the fact that imperialist countries were busy healing the wounds of war, and the temporary "boom" phenomenon in the capitalist world, and the rise and upsurge of the domestic patriotic movement, China's cement industry had a little more development. By 1937, when the War of Resistance Against Japan began, China's cement output had been 2.44 times that of 1922, an increase of 750,000 tons in fifteen years. However, on the other hand, the monopoly forces of imperialism have gradually penetrated into the cement industry. According to the proportion of production, imported cement increased from 13% in 1922 to 27% in 1931, affecting the development of China's cement industry. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, China's cement industry suffered devastating destruction. At the same time, Japanese imperialist monopoly capital vigorously developed cement enterprises in China's territory and plundered China's resources, which reached its peak in 1942. At that time, including the Japanese cement industry in China, the output was 2.29 million tons, which was the highest production level in history. Afterwards, with the destruction of the war of aggression and the dark rule of the corrupt Kuomintang government, the production of the cement industry has always been at a very low level. By the time of the national liberation, the total production was only 660,000 tons. What old China left us was such a poor and dilapidated cement industrial base.
　　After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, China's cement industry has achieved unprecedented rapid development. After only three years, by the end of the period of recovery of China's national economy, the national cement output reached 2.86 million tons, greatly exceeding the pre-war peak level. After the construction during the first five-year plan period, it is expected to reach 6.8 million tons by 1957, exceeding the first five-year plan target by about 13.3%. The increase in cement production in five years is more than that of Britain in the twenty-three years from 1913 to 1936. Of course, the current production level of cement in China is still not high, and it is only equivalent to the production level of Britain in 1936. Therefore, we need to work hard and strive to catch up!
　　During the second five-year plan period, due to the greater and faster development of China's socialist construction cause, the domestic demand is constantly increasing and increasing substantially, China's cement industry will have further development and growth on the basis of the first five-year plan. According to the suggestions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the cement production level will reach 12.5 million to 14.5 million tons in 1962, that is to say, during the second five-year plan period, a growth rate of 13% to 16% per year will be achieved. Such a rapid growth rate is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of China's socialist system. According to our estimates, if the growth rates of 10% and 8.3% per year are adopted in the third and fourth five-year plans respectively, then China's cement industry will reach 20 million tons in 1967 and about 30 million tons in 1972 on the basis of the 12.5 million tons level in 1962. In this way, China's cement industry will catch up with or surpass the production level of the British cement industry in the same period during the fourth five-year plan period. We will complete the nearly thirty-five-year journey that Britain started in 1936 in less than fifteen years. This is the vigorous pace of the Chinese people and the heroic ambition of the Chinese people!

　　水泥工业十五年能赶上英国
　　金迪三
    党中央向全国人民发出了一个伟大的号召——争取在十五年左右，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。
    这个口号，对于水泥工业来说，同样是一个光荣而艰巨的任务。
    目前英国水泥工业的生产水平怎样？我国水泥工业在多少年内能赶上或超过英国的生产水平？我们就来简单的谈谈这个问题。
    英国是世界上最早生产水泥的国家之一。远在十八世纪末，英国就创造了水泥工业。到了1824年，又获得了当时生产现代水泥（波特兰水泥）的专利权。到现在，英国的水泥工业生产水平发展到年产一千二百九十万吨，在世界水泥生产中占第四位。因此，英国的水泥工业是具有相当高的水平的。
    英国水泥工业的发展是经历了漫长的道路的。从第一次世界大战前夕开始，大体可分为三个历史时期。第一个时期是从1913年到1939年。二十六年间，产量增加了一点八六倍，平均每年上升4％。这个时期英国水泥工业能够得到这样比较平稳的发展，主要是由于在经过了一场世界大战之后，英国和其他帝国主义国家渡过了严重的经济危机，并且使资本主义有了新的发展和“繁荣”，因而水泥工业也就得到了相应的增长。1929—1933年有过一次广泛而深刻的危机，但看来当时水泥工业所受的影响并不大，在次一年（1933—34年）就开始复苏，而且在1939年达到了生产的最高峰——年产八百三十四万吨。因此，这一时期是英国水泥工业的上升和发展时期。
    但是，在1939年之后，资本主义世界发生了又一次规模空前和影响深远的经济危机。英国的工业生产缩减，随着，英国又卷入了1941年开始的第二次世界大战的漩涡中。战争使英国的经济失调更严重，在再生产过程中以及整个经济生活中发生混乱现象。因而，从那时起，英国水泥工业的生产就开始下降，特别是在战争后期，下降得更多。1945年的产量几乎只有战前最高年产量的一半。直到1948年才恢复到战前水平。因此，在1940—1948年间，英国的水泥工业是处于下降和停滞的状态。这是英国水泥工业的第二个历史时期。
    1948年以后，英国水泥工业进入了第三个历史时期，即战后发展的时期。这时期，英国水泥工业的发展速度是相当快的。七年中，产量增加了一半。平均每年的增长速度达到5％。比同时期英国的生铁、钢和煤的发展速度都要快得多。
    总的看来，在1913年到1956年的四十三年间，英国水泥工业的产量由二百九十二万吨增加到一千二百九十万吨，增加了341％，平均每年增长3.5％左右。
    在战后的年代里，英国水泥工业为什么会得到这样比较快的发展呢？主要原因是：
    （1）国民经济各部门在战后重建和建筑一定数量的住宅；
    （2）由于大力实行对外经济扩张，增加了出口量；
    （3）由于国民经济军事化而使军事战略工业和工厂建筑增加。
    英国是一个依赖出口的国家，也是一个大量输出水泥的国家，水泥的出口量并且一直居于世界的首位。在战后几年里，英国利用德国、日本和意大利遭到削弱的机会，将资源都用于争夺国外市场、扩大势力范围和提高出口水平，并把出口比例从占全部产品的22％增加到35％至40％，水泥的每年平均出口量也提高到一百七十万至一百八十万吨。1952年增加到二百零六万吨。出口量的增加，使英国水泥工业有可能维持较高的生产水平。
    在战后时期，英国的住宅建筑总数大大低于战前的水平，但是，由于军事战略建筑和工厂建设的扩大，英国的建筑业还是有很大的进展。1953年建筑量较上年增加了7％；1953年又有增加。由于建筑工业要占到全部工业生产的14％左右，因而它的增产必然会刺激水泥工业生产的上升。
    正是由于这些因素，战后英国的水泥工业才能达到每年平均上升5％；然而，这些因素却正在逐渐的衰退着。目前的情况是：资本主义世界市场中的竞争越来越尖锐化，1955年以来，英国遭到西德和日本排挤的情况也更加严重了（1956年日本水泥出口量超过英国而跃居世界第一位）；在国内，军事工业部门的新投资已大部完成，国民经济军事化对于英国经济的刺激力已成为强弩之末了。从1954年年底起，英国的经济矛盾有了显著的增长，民用工业从停滞转为下降，某些重工业的生产也正在日益恶化。由于英国政府采取了一系列降低劳动人民生活水平的办法来找寻出路，在住宅建筑方面也减少了15％。为革新和扩大固定资本的投资也开始下降……。这些，使英国水泥工业生产上升的速度逐步降低。如1954年比1953年上升了6.5％，1955年上升了4.8％，而1956年只上升了1.5％。因此，今后若干年内，英国水泥工业生产要达到5％的速度是相当困难的。为了便于计算，我们不妨仍按照这个数字来考虑。这样，估计到1967年时，将会达到二千二百万吨左右，而到1972年时，将会达到二千八百四十万吨左右的生产水平。
    现在我们再来谈谈我国水泥工业的情况。
    我国水泥工业生产开始于1886年，已有七十一年历史，比英国足足晚了六十多年。因此，还是比较年青的，而且当初是由英商开平矿务局在煤矿附近设厂开始的。
    我国的水泥工业从降生的第一天起，直到解放前的整整半个世纪里，一直饱受帝国主义的经济侵略。在第一次世界大战结束以前，是外国水泥垄断国内市场的时期，水泥工业一开始就遭到窒息性的摧残。自此以后，在1917—1937年的二十年间，由于帝国主义各国忙于医治战争的创伤，以及资本主义世界出现暂时的“景气”现象，和国内爱国运动的兴起和高涨的影响，我国水泥工业才有了稍多的发展。到抗日战争开始的1937年，我国水泥的产量已为1922年的二点四四倍，十五年内增长了七十五万吨。但是，另一方面，帝国主义的垄断势力也逐步渗透到水泥工业中来了，按生产量的比重，进口的水泥由1922年的13％，增加到1931年的27％，影响了我国水泥工业的发展。抗日战争期间，我国水泥工业遭受到毁灭性的破坏，同时，日本帝国主义的垄断资本却在我国领土上大力发展水泥企业，掠夺我国的资源，这在1942年时，更达到了极点。当时包括日本在华的水泥工业在内，产量有二百二十九万吨，成为历史上最高的生产水平。往后，随着侵略战争的破坏，和国民党腐败政府的黑暗统治，水泥工业的生产始终处在很低的水平线上。到全国解放时，总共只有六十六万吨的生产量。旧中国所遗留给我们的就是这样一个贫弱残破的水泥工业基础。
    解放以后，在党和政府的正确领导下，我国水泥工业得到了前所未有的迅速发展。仅仅经过三年，到我国国民经济恢复时期终结的时候，全国水泥产量达到二百八十六万吨，大大超过了战前的最高水平。经过第一个五年计划期间的建设，到1957年，预计将达到六百八十万吨，超过第一个五年计划指标约13.3％。五年中水泥生产量的增加比英国从1913年到1936年二十三年间增加得还要多。当然，目前我国水泥的生产水平还是不高的，还只相当于英国1936年的生产水平。因此，我们需要拿出干劲来，努力赶上去！
    在第二个五年计划期间，由于我国社会主义建设事业将有更多更快的发展，国内需要的不断增加和大量增加，我国水泥工业将在第一个五年计划的基础上有更进一步的发展和增长。按照中共第八次代表大会的建议，1962年水泥的生产水平将达到一千二百五十至一千四百五十万吨，也就是说，第二个五年计划期间，将获得每年上升13％到16％的增长速度。这样迅速的增长速度是我国社会主义制度优越性的具体表现，按照我们的估算，如果在第三个五年和第四个五年分别采取每年增长10％和8.3％的速度，那么，我国水泥工业1962年在一千二百五十万吨水平的基础上，1967年将达到二千万吨，1972年将达到三千万吨左右。这样，我国的水泥工业将在第四个五年计划期内赶上或超过同时期英国水泥工业的生产水平。我们将用十五年以内的时间走完英国从1936年开始走的将近三十五年的历程。这是中国人民的矫健的步伐，也是中国人民豪迈的志气！
