Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 26th: After a vigorous debate on running farms diligently and thriftily, one hundred state-owned farms in Jilin Province have decided to implement the principle of accomplishing more with less money, or even accomplishing things without spending money. This year, they aim not only to avoid losses but also to achieve a surplus of 1.44 million yuan.

The farms have first decided to reduce non-production expenditures to below 10%. Except for industrial products, baskets and small farm tools will generally be made by the employees themselves. In the future, newly built livestock sheds will all be simple cattle and horse sheds, pig and sheep pens, and chicken and duck coops, with construction costs reduced to less than ten yuan per square meter. Employee dormitories will generally be built through a combination of self-construction and public assistance, reducing expenses by 80% compared to the past.

The farms are also streamlining their organizations with a revolutionary spirit and implementing various labor organization systems suitable for the characteristics of agriculture. The number of management personnel detached from production will be greatly reduced, from 12% of the total workforce to 1.5%-2%. All farms will abolish sections and offices, establishing a comprehensive office under the leadership of the farm director to handle daily affairs. In terms of working hours, they will change the habit of not asking about busy or slack seasons and resting on holidays, proposing the slogan of "early to bed and early to rise" like the peasants, and implementing a system of not resting during busy farming seasons to ensure the completion of production tasks.

From February onwards, the farms will implement the "three guarantees" system of guaranteed output, guaranteed cost, and guaranteed profit, and implement new methods for paying labor remuneration, that is, 60%-80% of the wages will be prepaid each month, and the remainder will be paid at the end of the year. If the plan is completed or overfulfilled, all wages can be obtained or over-quota rewards can be received. After the implementation of the "three guarantees" system, labor efficiency has generally improved. The attendance rate of Changchun Animal Husbandry Farm has risen to 100%, and six operations such as manure digging, manure delivery, and hemp rope spinning have each exceeded the labor quota by 50%-100%. During the Spring Festival, all one hundred farms in the province generally implemented rotating rest, keeping the machines running even when people were resting, and making a concentrated effort to deliver manure.

On the basis of opposing waste, opposing conservatism, and running farms diligently and thriftily, the farms have revised their grain production targets. This year, twenty-five farms have set a grain production target of 6,000 jin per hectare. Efforts will be made to increase the grain yield per hectare in all farms in the province from 2,144 jin in 1957 to 6,000 jin (400 jin per mu) within three years, ensuring the completion of the Five-Year Plan in three years.

    少花钱多办事　不花钱也办事
    吉林一百个农场今年要有盈余
    新华社长春26日电　吉林省一百个国营农场经过勤俭办场的大辩论，决定贯彻少花钱多办事或不花钱也办事的原则，今年做到不但不赔钱，而且要盈余一百四十四万元。
    各农场首先决定把非生产开支减缩到10％以下。除工业产品外，筐篓和小农具一般由职工自己动手做。今后新建畜舍，一律修成简朴的牛马棚、猪羊圈和鸡鸭架，造价每平方公尺降到十元以下。职工宿舍普遍采用自建公助办法，开支要比过去减少80％。
    各农场还以革命精神紧缩机构，推行适合农业特点的各种组织劳动制度。各农场脱产管理人员将大大精简，使脱产管理人员从占总人数12％减到1.5％—2％。各场一律取消科、室机构，成立在场长领导下的综合办公室，掌管日常事务。在作息时间上，改变不问忙闲、遇假日就休息的习惯，提出和农民一样“起早贪黑”的口号，实行农忙不休息的办法，保证完成生产任务。
    各农场从2月起推行包产、包成本、包利润的“三包”制度，实行新的付给劳动报酬办法，即每月预付60％—80％的工资，其余在年末结算时再付，如果完成计划或超额完成计划时，便可得到全部工资或获得超额奖励。推行“三包”制度后，劳动效率已普遍提高，长春畜牧农场出勤率上升到100％，刨粪、送粪、纺麻绳等六项作业各超过劳动定额50％—100％。在春节期间，全省一百个农场普遍实行轮流休息，歇人不歇车，突击送粪。
    在反浪费、反保守、勤俭办场的基础上，各农场重新修订了粮食生产指标。今年就有二十五个农场每垧产粮指标达六千斤。争取再有三年，全省各农场每垧产粮从1957年的二千一百四十四斤提高到六千斤（每亩四百斤），保证五年计划三年完成。
