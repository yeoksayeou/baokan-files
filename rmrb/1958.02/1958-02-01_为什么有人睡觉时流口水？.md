Why do some people drool while sleeping?

Our sleeping posture is often on our side. Over time, the cheek pressed against the pillow becomes numb. This numbness stimulates the cheek nerves, similar to the reaction caused by seeing hawthorns, which is drooling. Another reason is that not rinsing your mouth after meals leads to the production of lactic acid in the oral cavity. The salivary gland nerves, stimulated by lactic acid, also cause drooling. Because the nerves lose coordination during sleep, meaning the nerves controlling swallowing are "resting," coupled with sleeping on one's side, saliva easily flows out of the mouth. (Zhang Hong)

    为什么有人睡觉时流口水？
    我们睡觉的姿势，往往是侧着身子的。时间一长，贴枕的腮就会麻木。这种麻木对腮神经的刺激，同我们平时见了山渣所引起的反应相同，那就是流口水。再就是因为饭后不漱口，口腔中产生乳酸。腮腺的神经在乳酸的刺激下，也要流口水的。由于睡觉时神经失去了协调，也就是说控制吞咽神经“休息”了，再加侧身而卧，所以口水很容易流出嘴来。　（张宏）
