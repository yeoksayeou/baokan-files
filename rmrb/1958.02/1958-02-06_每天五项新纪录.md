    Five New Records Every Day

    (Our Dispatch) A mass-based competition to emulate the advanced is underway among the more than 10,000 workers of the Jiawang Mining Bureau in Xuzhou City. In twenty-four days, 118 new bureau-wide records have been set, averaging five per day.

    On the first workday of this year, the Zhuang Hongsheng tunneling team of the Hanqiao Mine achieved 0.941 meters per worker, setting a new tunneling record for the entire bureau. This news shocked the workers of the entire bureau. The Li Xingyuan team studied the experience of the Zhuang Hongsheng team and immediately created an even higher record of one meter of tunneling. Later, the Ma Zaiguang team caught up with a score of 1.06 meters.

    This kind of competition within the same work type is also being carried out in various work types such as coal mining, support, coal machinery, trams, roadway repair, hook-up, and pillar removal. The bureau's famous support expert Chang Wenshan team created a new record of setting up 50 shelves per person per day, exceeding the usual amount of shelf setting by about one time.

    每天五项新纪录
    本报讯　一个群众性的比先进的竞赛，正在徐州市贾汪矿务局的万余职工中开展起来。二十四天当中，出现了一百一十八项全局新纪录，平均每天有五项。
    今年第一个工作日，韩桥矿庄洪生掘进小组，每工达到零点九四一公尺，创造了全局掘进新纪录。这一消息震动了全局的职工。李兴元小组学习了庄洪生小组的经验，紧接着便创造了掘进一公尺的更高的纪录。后来，马在广小组又以一点零六公尺的成绩赶到前面。
    这种同工种竞赛，也在采煤、支柱、煤机、电车、巷修、挂钩、回柱等各种工种中开展起来。全局著名的支柱能手常文善小组，创造了每日每人扶棚五十架的新纪录，超过过去一般扶棚数量一倍左右。
