To Improve Leadership Style, Going Deep into Urban and Rural Grassroots Units
Ministry of Health Leaders Engage in "Experimental Plots"
Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Health Bureau Responsible Cadres Conduct Pilot Work at Tongren Hospital

This newspaper reports that the rectification movement within the Ministry of Health has entered the stage of in-depth rectification and reform. Recently, the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Health conducted discussions on the issue of improving leadership style and methods. In order to overcome the problems of bureaucracy and subjectivism in leadership, and to ensure that leadership thinking can keep up with the new situation of rapid advances in industrial and agricultural production and various other tasks, the leadership comrades of the Ministry of Health must organize their work with a revolutionary spirit, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, it has been determined that leading cadres should adopt the method of "experimental plots," going deep into grassroots health units to create typical examples and summarize experiences. To ensure the progress of "experimental plot" work, leaders at the director-general and bureau-director levels and above have been organized, determining that ministers, vice ministers, and Party Leadership Group members will spend four months each year going to areas with serious diseases, grassroots health units, and medical colleges to inspect and assist in the work; cadres at the director-general and bureau-director levels will take turns going to the grassroots to participate in practical work.

In order to more comprehensively cultivate various types of typical examples, the ministry has decided to select one county each in the south, north, and mountainous regions as "experimental plots" for rural health work. The preliminary selection includes a county in Hunan Province for the south, Zhuoxian County in Hebei Province for the north, and Huangling County in Shaanxi Province for the mountainous region. Within each of these counties, a director-general-level cadre will regularly hold a specific position in the county health section or county hospital. Currently, Li Benzhou, Deputy Director of the Medical and Preventive Department of the ministry, has already led a group of cadres to Huangling County to carry out the various specific organizational tasks of the "experimental plot." Personnel responsible for other experimental plot work will also arrive at their destinations successively before March.

The main content of the rural health work "experimental plots" roughly includes the following aspects: (1) organizing and relying on the masses to carry out the elimination of the four pests and the eradication of diseases, studying how to make the patriotic health movement regular; (2) based on the situation of the great leap forward in rural production, studying the organizational forms and development directions of rural grassroots health organizations; (3) studying the organizational form of county-level health organizations; (4) implementing the policy of running hospitals diligently and frugally, studying the establishment of simple sickbeds, and improving hospital management work. The above content will also be focused on separately in the three counties. For example, in Hunan, the main focus will be on eradicating schistosomiasis and malaria; in Hebei, the main focus will be on the organizational form of health organizations; and in Shaanxi, the main focus will be on preventing and controlling endemic diseases in mountainous areas and the form of health organizations in mountainous areas.

The Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Health has also decided to take Beijing Sixth Hospital as the "experimental plot" for urban hospital work. A director-general-level cadre from the Ministry of Health will take turns serving as a leader in the hospital, mainly implementing the spirit of the Ministry of Health's hospital conference and summarizing the experience of various tasks.

In addition, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Health Bureau, in order to gain experience and strengthen leadership over hospitals throughout the city, are using Tongren Hospital as an "experimental plot." Cui Yueli, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, Wang Dingkun, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, Yan Jingqing, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, and Yan Yi, Deputy Director, are responsible for the work of the "experimental plot." Comrades such as Cui Yueli and Wang Dingkun arrived at Tongren Hospital on the 11th of this month to participate in the work. They have now preliminarily formulated a work plan for the "experimental plot."

    改进领导作风　深入城乡基层单位
    卫生部领导干部搞“试验田”
    北京市委和卫生局负责干部到同仁医院进行试点工作
    本报讯　卫生部的整风运动已进入深入整改阶段。最近中共卫生部党组对改进领导作风和领导方法问题进行了讨论。为了克服领导上的官僚主义、主观主义毛病，使领导思想能够跟上目前工、农业生产和各项工作飞跃前进的新形势，卫生部领导同志必须以革命的精神组织工作，做到多快好省。因此确定领导干部都要采取“试验田”的办法，深入卫生基层单位，创造典型，总结经验。为了保证“试验田”工作的进行，将司、局长级以上的领导干部进行了排队，确定部长、副部长、党组成员每年外出四个月，到疾病严重地区、卫生基层单位及医学院校去检查帮助工作；司、局长级干部轮流到基层去参加实际工作。
    为了较全面地培养各类典型，该部确定选择南方、北方和山区各一个县做为农村卫生工作“试验田”。初步确定南方的为湖南省的一个县，北方的为河北省涿县，山区的为陕西省黄陵县。在以上各县内，经常有一个司长级干部在县卫生科或县医院担任具体工作。目前该部医疗预防司李本周副司长已经率领一批干部到黄陵县进行“试验田”的各项具体组织工作。负责其他试验田工作的人员，也将于3月份以前相继到达目的地。
    农村卫生工作“试验田”的主要内容大致有以下几方面：（一）组织和依靠群众开展除四害、消灭疾病，研究如何使爱国卫生运动经常化；（二）根据农村生产大跃进的情况，研究农村基层卫生组织的组织形式和发展方向；（三）研究县一级卫生组织的组织形式；（四）贯彻勤俭办医院的方针，研究设置简易病床，改进医院管理工作。以上内容，在三个县内也分别确定重点进行。如在湖南主要研究消灭血吸虫病、疟疾等，河北主要研究卫生组织的组织形式，陕西主要研究防治山区地方病和山区卫生组织的形式。
    卫生部党组还确定以北京市第六医院为城市医院工作的“试验田”。卫生部轮流有一个司长级干部在该院担任领导工作，主要贯彻卫生部医院会议的精神，总结各项工作的经验。
    又讯　中共北京市委和市卫生局为取得经验，加强对全市医院的领导，以同仁医院为“试验田”。并派市委统战部长崔月犁、宣传部副部长王定坤，市卫生局局长严镜清、副局长阎毅负责“试验田”的工作。崔月犁、王定坤等同志已于本月11日到同仁医院参加工作。现在，他们已初步制定出“试验田”工作计划。
