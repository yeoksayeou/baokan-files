Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: The International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam issued a communique on the 5th, before moving its headquarters to Saigon.

The communique stated that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, established on August 11, 1954, set up its headquarters in Hanoi. The International Commission originally decided that after the headquarters had been stationed in Hanoi for one year, it would move the headquarters to Saigon. It was not until November 1956 that the International Commission received notification from the Government of the Republic of Vietnam regarding its consent to the International Commission moving its headquarters to Saigon. However, from that time until recently, the necessary housing for the relocation had not been arranged. Now that these necessary arrangements have been properly made, the International Commission will move its headquarters from Hanoi to Saigon at the end of March this year.

During the period when the headquarters of the International Commission was stationed in Hanoi, an office was set up in Saigon, and each delegation stationed a representative in this office. When the International Commission moves to Saigon, this office will be dissolved, and at the same time, the International Commission will set up an office in Hanoi. At this time, the International Commission would like to express its gratitude to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the reception, assistance, and cooperation it has provided during the entire period that the headquarters has been stationed in Hanoi.

　　越南国际委员会总办事处
    下月将从河内迁西贡
    据新华社河内6日电　越南国际监督和监察委员会在把总办事处迁往西贡之前5日发表了一个公报。
    公报说，1954年8月11日成立的越南国际监督和监察委员会在河内设立了总办事处。国际委员会原来决定，在总办事处驻在河内一年以后，就把总办事处迁到西贡去。一直到1956年11月，国际委员会才接到越南共和国政府关于同意国际委员会把总办事处迁到西贡的通知。但是，从那个时候到最近，有关迁移所必需的房屋还没有安排好。现在，这些必要的安排已经妥当了，国际委员会将于今年3月底把总办事处从河内迁到西贡。
    在国际委员会总办事处驻河内期间，曾经在西贡设有办事处，每个代表团在这个办事处都驻有一名代表。当国际委员会迁到西贡的时候，这个办事处将解散，同时，国际委员会将在河内设立一个办事处。在这个时候，国际委员会谨对越南民主共和国政府在总办事处驻河内的整个期间所给予的接待、帮助和合作表示感激。
