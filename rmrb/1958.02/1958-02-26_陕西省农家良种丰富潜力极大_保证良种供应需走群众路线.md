Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: How to make fine seed selection and breeding adapt to the current needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production is a problem that the relevant departments in Shaanxi Province have begun to pay attention to and are trying to solve.

Recently, the reporter learned from the agricultural leadership departments of Shaanxi Province that, according to statistics on ten major crops such as wheat, cotton, and rice, the types of fine seeds currently available in the province can only meet about half of the province's needs for the popularization of fine seeds. Moreover, there is a lack of a large number of new reserve varieties to update and replace varieties that will be eliminated. One of the main manifestations of the lagging of fine seed selection and breeding work behind the development of production is the contradiction between the single variety of major crops such as wheat and rice and the multi-variety combination required for large-field production after cooperation. Shaanxi Province has made outstanding achievements in promoting wheat "Bima No. 1" in the past few years, but after most areas of the province planted this variety, it not only caused difficulties in labor and water and fertilizer supply due to the large concentration of farm work, but also caused widespread yield reduction due to the prevalence of stripe rust last year. Secondly, due to the lack of fine seeds, some crops in many areas of the province are still in a state of fine seed blank, which affects the increase in production.

To solve the problem of fine seed needs, we must resolutely follow the mass line. This has been proven by the experience of Shaanxi Province in the past. Selecting and breeding native varieties to accelerate the speed of fine seed popularization has always had successful experience in Shaanxi Province. For example, the famous "Bima No. 1" was a successful hybrid of the local native variety of grasshopper wheat and the introduced variety of Biyu wheat. In less than eight years, it has been promoted to 16 million mu in the province, accounting for more than 70% of the wheat field area. In 1952, "Yejihong" corn with early-maturing characteristics was discovered in Hancheng, and it has been promoted to 240,000 mu in 39 counties in the past five years, with a yield increase rate of up to about 19%. Many counties have also successfully used local native varieties to solve problems such as "corn on the mountain" and "rice on the mountain," and have achieved increased production. However, in recent years, some areas have developed the idea of ​​relying solely on state supply in the work of popularizing fine seeds, which has greatly delayed the speed of fine seed popularization.

After preliminary research, the agricultural leadership departments of Shaanxi Province believe that to overcome these contradictions and enable fine seed selection and breeding work to meet the requirements of agricultural leap forward in a "good, more, faster, and more economical" manner, in addition to actively cultivating new varieties, we should mainly tap the potential from the abundant native varieties. In 1957, the province discovered many valuable varieties in the investigation of more than 5,300 native varieties, which are worth propagating and promoting locally. For example, the "Bailiusha" and "Jiugenqi" millet seeds and the "Erben" corn seeds in northern Shaanxi, and the "Hongdatou" and "Duozhifen Nie" wheat in the Guanzhong area, not only have high adaptability and stress resistance, but also have yields that exceed the fine seeds promoted locally. Liu Chengzong, a seed selection expert from Ganhe Township, Zhouzhi County, has preserved more than 60 original wheat varieties, among which "Chengzong No. 22" is not only high and stable in yield, but also has a higher resistance to wheat midges and stripe rust than "Bima No. 1." In this survey, more than a dozen rare high-altitude rice varieties such as "Bingshui Bai" and "Jinguangzhao" and dozens of excellent miscellaneous grain varieties suitable for replanting, such as "Yiwofeng" soybeans, "Zigaitou" millet suitable for planting in mountainous areas, and "Lianjiatiao" black beans, were also discovered. These newly discovered fine seeds are very promising to fill the fine seed blank in some areas of the province for some crops. The investigation and evaluation of a large number of native varieties has also provided valuable information for the agricultural experiment and research departments of the province to select and breed new varieties. According to statistics, the agricultural experiment stations in the province have now selected more than 100 hybrid combinations from native varieties of nine types of crops and have begun to cultivate new varieties in large quantities.

    陕西省农家良种丰富潜力极大
    保证良种供应需走群众路线
    本报特约新华社专讯　如何使良种选育适应目前农业生产大跃进的需要，陕西省有关部门已着手注意研究解决。
    最近记者从陕西省农业领导部门获悉：根据麦、棉、稻等十个主要作物的统计，这个省现在所掌握的良种品类还只能满足全省良种普及需要的一半左右。而且，还缺乏大量新的后备品种用来更新和替换将被淘汰的品种。良种选育工作落后于生产发展的主要表现之一，是小麦、水稻等主要作物品种的单一化和合作化后大田生产所要求的多品种组合发生矛盾。陕西省在过去几年推广小麦“碧蚂一号”上取得突出成绩，但全省大部分地区都种植了这种品种后，不仅因农活的大量集中而造成了劳力和水、肥供应上的困难，而且去年曾因条锈病流行而造成普遍减产。其次，由于良种缺乏，全省现有不少地区的一些作物还处于良种空白状态，使增产受到影响。
    解决良种需要问题，必须坚决走群众路线，这一点是过去陕西省的经验所证明了的。选育农家品种以加速良种普及的速度，在陕西省历来就有成功的经验。如著名的“碧蚂一号”，就是引用当地农家良种蚂蚱麦和引进品种碧玉麦杂交成功的，在不到八年时间内全省已推广到一千六百万亩，占麦田面积的70％以上。1952年在韩城发现具有早熟特性的“野鸡红”玉米，五年来已推广到三十九个县二十四万亩面积，增产率高达19％左右。还有许多县份已经成功地利用当地农家品种，解决了“玉米上山”“水稻上山”等问题，获得增产。但是，最近几年来，有些地区在良种普及工作上产生了单纯依靠国家供应的思想，结果大大延缓了良种普及的速度。
    陕西省农业领导部门初步研究后认为，要克服上面这些矛盾，使良种选育工作能够“好、多、快、省”地适应农业跃进的要求，除了积极培育新品种外，主要应该从丰富的农家品种中去挖掘潜力。这个省在1957年对五千三百多个农家品种的调查工作中已经发现了许多名贵的品种，值得就地繁殖和推广。如陕北的“白流沙”、“九根齐”谷种和“二笨”玉米种，关中地区的“红大头”和“多枝分蘖”小麦等，不仅都具有很高的适应性和抗逆能力，而且有的产量已经超过当地推广的良种。盩厔县甘河乡的选种能手刘承宗，一个人就保存有六十多个小麦原始品种，其中“承宗22”号不仅产量高而稳定，抗吸浆虫和条锈病的能力还高于“碧蚂一号”。在这次调查中还发现了“冰水白”、“金光照”等十多个稀有的高山区水稻品种和适合于复种的“一窝蜂”大豆、适宜于山区种植的“紫盖头”糜子、“链夹条”黑豆等好几十个优秀的杂粮品种。这些新发现的良种，都很有希望可以用来填补全省某些地区的一些作物上的良种空白，通过对大量的农家品种的调查和评选。还给全省各农业试验研究部门提供了选育新品种的宝贵资料。据统计，现在全省各农业试验站已经从九类作物的农家品种里选定一百多个杂交组合，开始大量培育新的品种。
