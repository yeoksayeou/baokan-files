Fundamentally Change Work Style
Zhou Yun, Secretary of the Branch of the Fine Yarn Workshop, Wuhan State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1

“Pressure from Above, Squeezing from Below”

In the past, I didn’t think the work wasn't tough. The workshop meetings needed your leadership, the factory meetings needed your participation; sometimes there were several meetings a day, morning, afternoon, and evening. If the factory needed to find someone in the workshop, they would call you to find them. I was busy from morning till night, more than ten hours a day. I was so busy, but the masses' thinking was still chaotic, their demands for living standards were high, and the production plan was not completed. The situation was most serious in September and October last year, when the attendance rate was once as low as 70% and the yarn breakage rate rose to more than 70 ends. The work assigned by the higher authorities could not be implemented in the workshop. The demands made by the masses could not be met by the workshop. I thought this was really a case of “pressure from above and squeezing from below,” blaming the leadership for not providing specific help and blaming the masses for being ideologically backward. When the factory was about to send cadres to the countryside and new joint state-private factories, I went to the organization department two or three times a day, determined to be sent down and never do workshop leadership work again.

Just at this time, the factory organized workers to visit Junxian and Xiangfan, and the masses' thinking immediately underwent a drastic change. They universally and voluntarily abandoned excessive demands for living standards, and after work stayed in the workshop to clean up old materials, repair tools, and learn from others' advanced operating experience, setting off a production upsurge of diligence and thrift in running the enterprise and a quality leap forward. How could I thoroughly change my ideology and work style to truly lead this upsurge? I was troubled by not knowing where to start.

The experience of Hongan County enlightened and helped me!

They carry hoes to the fields to produce, we carry notebooks and walk around the workshop.

As soon as the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director led us into Hongan County, we felt that the atmosphere here was very different from that in our factory. We carried big notebooks around the workshop all day, and were criticized by the masses. The cadres here carried hoes to the fields to produce and were welcomed by the masses. We visited the Jiansu Commune in Xinghua Township, a large commune with more than a thousand households. The cadre stationed in the commune introduced the entire commune's situation without looking at a notebook, how many households, how many laborers, how many Party and League members, and how much land, what crops were planted last year, and how much the yield was, he didn't even pause for a moment, he even gave the decimal points. He was really familiar with the situation! What about myself? The situation in the workshop is much more concentrated than in an agricultural commune, but when the Party Committee asks me to report on the production situation, I can't talk about it, and I don't even know how many people are in the workshop. I began to realize that my past work was really not thorough enough.

We also visited the experimental plot of the County Party Committee Secretary. In the past, the Party Committee Secretary thought the experience of Hongan County was good and asked us to set up an experimental work zone as well. But our thinking was not clear, we didn't participate in production ourselves, and to understand the situation, we still had to look at reports and listen to reports from the foremen, making the experimental work zone nominal. This time I saw that they adopted the method of "three combinations," that is, leaders, technical cadres, and experienced old farmers worked together, so that leaders who didn't understand production could learn production through experimental plots, and new technologies could set an example through experimental plots for comprehensive promotion. Here, I found a way to transform myself from a layman to an expert.

We also listened to the comrades of the County Party Committee introduce how they used to concentrate cadres in the county, their work style was not thorough enough, and the masses criticized them for "four more and one less": more riding bicycles, more playing basketball, more eating in the canteen, more wearing overcoats, and less going to the countryside to run communes. Since the end of the year before last, they have been sending cadres down to change their work style, requiring cadres to go down and take long-term responsibility for running communes. A cadre lived only three miles from the commune where he was stationed, but he did not go home for three months during the intense drought resistance, and the masses gave him an evaluation: "In 1956, you were the wife's bodyguard, and in 1957, you became the people's servant." A cadre got along very well with the masses in the commune, and when the leadership wanted to transfer him, the masses refused to let him go, and said, "You can work here for the rest of your life, and we will get you a big coffin when you die." It was because the cadres' work style was thoroughly changed that Hongan County led the masses to achieve a great harvest in 1957. Their past situation was not better than our current situation, but when their ideology and work style underwent a great transformation, they achieved such great work results, which gave me confidence in doing a good job.

Finally, we also visited model figures such as Fang Heming and Xu Dama, among whom the most moving to me was the disabled soldier Jiang Chuanhai. His age was similar to mine, and we were both transferred from the army. He also lost a leg and had to use crutches to walk, but he supported his leg with a stick to hoe the ground. It was difficult to use his foot to draw water, so he put his broken leg on the frame and used his hands to draw. He finally learned the field work. In order to establish a new rural culture, he also paid for books himself and mobilized the masses in the village to study culture in the commune. There was a small river between the village and the commune, and it was inconvenient to go to school at night, so he took the lead in paying for a small bridge. On snowy days, the bridge was very slippery, and he couldn't walk with one leg, so he knelt down and crawled over it, insisting on studying at night. People can overcome such great difficulties, what about myself? If I don't do a good job, I'm really letting the Party down!

One Expertise, Two Assists, Three -izations, Four Packages

When I came back and talked to the comrades in the workshop, everyone was very excited and believed that we must immediately change our ideology and work style. We put forward the action slogan of "One Expertise" (transforming from a layman to an expert), "Two Assists" (assisting shifts and work areas in doing a good job), "Three -izations" (cadres -ized as workers, life -ized as the masses, labor -ized as regular), and "Four Packages" (package production plan, package ideological education, package central work, package promoting advanced experience), and adopted two main measures:

First, step out of the office and go deep into shifts, work areas, and groups. The responsible cadres of the workshop were assigned to the three shifts and determined key work areas and key people within the shifts to provide specific assistance. According to the experience of Hongan County, we also organized responsible cadres of the workshop, technicians, and veteran workers to work together in experimental work areas and experimental machines, stipulating that each cadre should participate in group labor for two mornings a week and learn an operational skill within a certain period of time.

Second, step out of the individual small family, move into the collective dormitory, and integrate with the workers in thought and life. All cadres above the level of foreman in our workshop, except for one who was sick, moved into the workers' dormitory and lived with the workers.

In order to implement these two measures, we also, according to the instructions of the Party Committee's streamlining meeting, merged the original production meetings twice a week and the production dynamics analysis meeting once a week into one meeting, and merged the branch committee and the joint Party, government, labor union meeting into an expanded branch committee meeting. We also stipulated that no meetings should be held in the morning, to ensure the cadres' time to go deep into production.

“A Disciple Like You Is Easy to Teach”

We have only been doing this for just over two weeks, and we have already seen some benefits. As far as I am concerned, I have learned a lot of basic production knowledge by working with technicians and veteran workers in the experimental work area of the second work area of Class A. In the past, I only listened to reports and knew that something or a part was broken and affected production, but I didn't know what the thing looked like, how it broke, and why it affected production. Now, I see it on the spot and study it on the spot, and the impression is much deeper. I participated in labor and originally planned to learn how to clean the car body in three months and learn how to clean the car head in three months. But after I worked with the master worker for three mornings, he assigned me to install four "ram's horns" myself, and three of them met the quality standards. The master said, "A disciple like you is easy to teach, you can learn how to clean the car body in a month." Originally, the workshop directors, Comrades Cha Wenkui and Wang Yongjiang, who understood technology, set up six experimental machines, which not only found the reasons affecting the quality of yarn, but also rectified some production management systems.

Can Understand Production While Lying in Bed

When we first moved into the collective dormitory, the workers were very surprised. Some asked me, "Are you here to wean your child?" I said, "Comrade Cha also moved in, is he also here to wean his child?" which made everyone laugh for a while. We played chess, played cards, and chatted with the workers in the dormitory, which slowly changed the workers' attitude towards us from alienation to closeness, and then to mutual understanding and equal treatment. In the past, some workers said that my attitude was blunt, but now they say that I "can talk to him." In the past, some workers reflected that the workshop director didn't have much work to do, but now they say, "It turns out that the workshop director's work is so heavy and so busy." The masses have already started to be able to say anything to us. I learned in the dormitory that the reason why Xia Zhanjun changed from being positive to being chronically negative was: she overfulfilled the plan every month in 1956, and according to the regulations, she should have participated in the factory's selection of representatives to attend the city's advanced producers' conference, but the workshop missed her name. She thought the leadership was deceiving people, and she said to whatever work the workshop assigned: "Deceiving people, it's still the same even if you work to death." But we didn't understand this situation for a long time, so we couldn't do work on her, but now that we have found the root cause, it's easy to handle. Workshop Director Comrade Cha Wenkui has listened to workers' direct reflections on five production-related issues in the dormitory these days, and quickly solved four of them. Once, workers also commented to him that the doffing leader Zhang Mingzhu's work was not good, and after he learned that Zhang's skills were indeed relatively poor, he sent Zhang to another class to "study" and learn from the experience of other doffing leaders. We have a sentence to describe the situation after moving into the dormitory: "In the past, you had to be in the class to understand production, but now you can understand production while lying in bed." The factory assigned a big cleaning on Sunday, but the workers all wanted to go home on Saturday night, and many people couldn't return to the factory the next day, so the big cleaning was difficult to carry out. I immediately volunteered not to go home on Saturday night, and many workers saw that I was like this and automatically didn't go home either. Everyone cleaned the dormitory neatly and cheerfully on Sunday, making the patriotic health campaign unfold smoothly.

Our workshop's production has also made progress. The back waste of 21-count yarn in January decreased from an average of 0.36% in the second half of last year to 0.3%, the breakage rate decreased from 56 ends to 49 ends, and the attendance rate also rose to 93.38%.

Changing our ideology and work style is just the beginning. But we are determined and confident to have a great ideological revolution and a great transformation of work style in this rectification campaign, and then to organize an upsurge of great leap forward in industrial production.

    从根本上转变作风
    武汉国棉一厂细纱车间支部书记　周云
    “上压下挤”
    要在以前，我并不认为工作不艰苦。车间开会要你领导，厂里开会要你参加，有时一天几个会，上午开，下午、晚上也开。厂里要在车间找人，也打电话叫你去找。我每天从早忙到晚，忙十多个钟头。自己这样忙，但群众思想还很混乱，对生活待遇要求很高，而生产计划却完不成。去年9、10月最严重的时候，出勤率曾经低到70％以上，断头上升到70多根。上级布置的工作，车间不能贯彻。群众提出的要求，车间不能解决。我认为这真是“上压下挤”，埋怨领导不具体帮助，埋怨群众思想落后。正好工厂要下放干部去农村和新的公私合营工厂，我就一天找组织部长两三次，坚决要求下放，再也不搞车间领导工作了。
    就在这个时候，工厂组织职工去均县、襄樊参观回来，群众思想立即起了剧烈的变化，普遍地自动放弃生活待遇上的过高要求，下班后还留在车间清理旧料、修补工具和学习别人的先进操作经验，掀起了勤俭办企业和质量大跃进的生产高潮。怎样彻底转变思想作风，使自己真正领导起这个高潮来呢？我苦于没有门路。
    红安县的经验给了我启发，给了我帮助！
    人家扛着锄头下地生产  我们挟着本子在车间转
    党委书记和厂长领着我们一进入红安县境，就感到这里的气氛跟我们工厂大不相同。我们整天挟个大本子在车间转，受到群众指责。这里的干部扛着锄头下地生产，受到群众欢迎。我们去杏花乡建苏社参观，这是个有一千多户的大社，驻社的干部不看一看笔记本，就介绍全社情况，有多少户、多少劳动力、多少党团员和多少土地，去年种了些什么作物，产量多少，他一个顿儿也不打，连小数点也说出来了，对情况真熟悉！我自己呢？车间的情况比农业社集中多了，但党委要我汇报生产情况我就谈不出来，甚至车间多少人也不了解。我开始认识到自己过去的工作实在不深入。
    我们还参观了县委书记的试验田。过去党委书记认为红安县的经验好，叫我们也搞了个试验工区。但我们思想不明确，自己不参加生产，要了解情况还得看表报和听工长汇报，闹得试验工区有名无实。我这次看见人家是采取“三结合”的办法，即由领导干部、技术干部和有经验的老农共同搞，使不懂生产的领导干部能通过试验田学会生产，使新技术能通过试验田做出榜样，全面推广。我在这里找到了怎样使自己由外行变内行的方法。
    我们还听县委的同志介绍，他们过去把干部集中在县里，作风不深入，群众批评他们“四多一少”：骑自行车的多，打篮球的多，吃食堂的多，穿大衣的多，下乡办社的少。他们从前年年底开始下放干部，转变作风，要干部下去长期包干办社。有个干部驻的社离他家只有三里路，但他在紧张的抗旱中三个月没回家，群众便给了他个评价：“你1956年是老婆的卫士，1957年成了人民的勤务员。”有个干部跟社里的群众搞得很好，领导要调他工作，群众不肯放，并且说：“你就在这里干一辈子，死了我们给你办口大棺材。”就因为干部作风彻底转变，红安县才领导群众在1957年获得大丰收。他们过去的情况并不比我们现时好，但当他们思想作风大转变后就取得这大的工作成绩，使我也有了能搞好工作的信心。
    我们最后还访问了方和明、徐大妈等模范人物，其中使我最激动的是残废军人江川海。他的年龄跟我差不多，又都是从部队转业下来的。他还断了一条腿，走路都要扶拐杖，而他却用棍子支着腿去锄地。用脚车水有困难，他就将断腿搁在架子上，用手车。他终于使自己学会了田间工作。为了建立农村新文化，他还自己掏钱买书，发动村里的群众去社里学文化。村与社之间有道小河，夜里上学不方便，他又带头出钱搭了个小桥。冰雪天，桥上很滑溜，独脚没法行走，他便跪着爬过去，坚持夜学。人家这大困难都能克服，自己怎样呢？我要再不搞好工作，真对不起党！
    一专二助三化四包
    我回来向车间同志们一谈，大家都很激动，认为必须立即转变思想作风。我们提出了一专（由外行变内行）二助（帮助轮班和工区搞好工作）三化（干部工人化、生活群众化、劳动经常化）四包（包生产计划、包思想教育、包中心工作、包推广先进经验）的行动口号，并采取了两项主要措施：
    一是走出办公室，深入轮班、工区和小组。车间负责干部分工到三班去，并在班内确定重点工区和重点人，给予具体帮助。我们还根据红安县经验，由车间负责干部和技术员、老工人一起搞试验工区和试验机台，规定每个干部每星期下小组劳动两个上午，并且要在一定时期学会一项操作技术。
    二是走出个人小家庭，搬入集体大宿舍，从思想到生活与工人打成一片。我们工长以上的干部，除一人有病外，都搬入了工人宿舍，与工人生活在一起。
    为了贯彻这两项措施，我们还根据党委精简会议的指示，又将行政上原来的每星期两次生产会议和一次生产动态分析会合并为一个会，支部的委员会和党政工团碰头会合并为一个支委扩大会。我们还规定上午一律不开会，保证干部深入生产的时间。
    “你这样的徒弟好带”
    我们这样做，才不过两个多星期，已看出一些好处。以我来讲，我和技术员、老工人在甲班二工区搞试验工区，就了解了许多基本的生产知识。过去光听汇报，只知道什么部件或零件坏了影响生产，但这个东西是什么样子，怎么坏的和为什么坏了就影响生产，都不知道。现在我亲自在现场看，在现场研究，印象就深刻多了。我参加劳动，原计划三个月学会洗车身，三个月学会洗车头。但我跟老师傅劳动三个上午以后，他就分配我自己动手安了四个“羊角”，有三个合乎质量。师傅说：“你这样的徒弟好带，一个月就能学会洗车身。”原来懂技术的车间主任查文奎、王永江两同志搞了六台试验机台，不仅查出影响纱支质量的原因，同时整顿了一些生产管理制度。
    躺在床上也能了解生产
    我们最初搬入集体宿舍，工人很惊讶。有的就问我：“你是不是为了给孩子断奶？”我说：“查主任也搬来了，他也是为了断奶？”惹得大家嘻笑了一阵。我们在宿舍和工人一起下棋、打扑克、谈家常，使工人同我们慢慢地由疏远转为亲近，进而互相了解，平等相待。过去，有的工人说我态度生硬，现在说我“能谈得来”。过去，有的工人反映车间主任没有什么工作，现在却说“原来车间主任工作这样繁重，这样忙。”群众已经开始有什么话都能向我们说。我就在宿舍里了解到夏占君由积极转为长期消极的原因：她1956年月月全面超额完成计划，按规定应该参加全厂评选出席全市先进生产者大会的代表，但车间把她的名子漏了。她认为领导上欺骗人，车间布置什么工作，她都说：“骗人，干死了还不是这样。”但我们长期不了解这个情况，也就无法对她做工作，而现在找到根子就好办了。车间主任查文奎同志这些日子在宿舍听工人直接反映了五个有关生产的问题，很快便解决了四个。有一次，工人还向他评论落纱长张明珠工作不行，经他了解张的技术确实比较差，便派张去别班“留学”，学别的落纱长的经验。我们有句话形容住入宿舍后的情况：“过去要在班上才能了解生产，现时躺在床上也能了解生产。”工厂布置星期天大扫除，但工人都想星期六晚上回家，很多人第二天不能回厂，大扫除很难进行。我当时就自报星期六晚上不回家，许多工人见我这样，也就自动不回家了。大家在星期日热热闹闹地把宿舍打扫得干干净净，使爱国卫生运动顺利展开。
    我们车间的生产也有了进步。二十一支纱在1月份的回花由去年下半年平均0.36％降为0.3％，断头由五十六根降为49根，出勤率也上升到93.38％。
    转变思想作风，这还只是开端。但我们有决心有信心在这次整风中来个思想大革命，作风大转变，进而组织起工业生产大跃进的高潮。
