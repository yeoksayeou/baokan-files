Grasp Mulberry and Silkworm Together: Great Development of Silk
　　Will Leap to World's First Place Within Five Years

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: China's silk production will leap forward rapidly during the Second Five-Year Plan period. According to the preliminary plans drafted by representatives of various provinces at this National Mulberry, Silkworm, and Tussah Silkworm Production Conference, the yield of mulberry silkworm cocoons and silk production will exceed pre-war levels and surpass Japan within five years, leaping to the first place in the world. In 1962, the national mulberry silkworm cocoon production can reach twice the highest annual output before the war (4,416,500 dan in 1931), far exceeding Japan, the world's largest silk producer. The output in 1967 will far exceed the highest total output ever recorded in the world.

　　The National Mulberry, Silkworm, and Tussah Silkworm Production Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to promote silk production, concluded on the 13th after ten days of discussions.

　　Vice Chairman Zhu spoke at the conference, saying that developing silk production is of great significance for increasing people's income, expanding employment, supplying domestic and foreign needs, accumulating funds for national construction, and earning foreign exchange. Party committees at all levels must attach importance to this work. Because only with the attention and leadership of Party committees at all levels can the propaganda and education work on developing silk production be thoroughly carried out from top to bottom, can the tendency of emphasizing grain over mulberry be avoided (emphasizing grain is correct, but neglecting mulberry is wrong), can support be given to the masses in terms of cadres, technology, and seeds, and can problems in feeding, processing, and pricing be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. China has fully sufficient conditions for developing silk production. The broad masses of Chinese peasants have always had the experience and habits of raising silkworms, and silkworms can be raised suitablely no matter where you are located, men, women, old and young can raise silkworms. Therefore, the development of China's sericulture has a great future. Striving to catch up during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's silk production will surely surpass all silk-producing countries in the world.

　　The conference also heard numerous reports from various regions on advanced typical experiences in planting mulberries, raising silkworms, and releasing tussah silkworms. These reports demonstrated that since cooperativization, a number of mulberry orchards with a yield of "1,000 jin of leaves and 100 jin of cocoons" per mu have emerged across the country, with many high-yield models. All of this greatly encouraged the representatives from various regions. During the conference, the representatives excitedly drafted their respective provinces' and regions' leap forward plans for silk production. The old mulberry silkworm regions of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong are to leap forward, and mulberry silkworm production in almost all provinces and regions across the country is to leap forward. Representatives from provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, and Hunan proposed to catch up with or surpass the old silkworm regions within ten years. In terms of tussah silkworm production, provinces such as Heilongjiang and Shanxi also plan to catch up with or surpass old regions such as Shandong. In particular, Hebei Province's leap forward plan for developing mulberry silkworms played a great promotional role at the conference. Hebei will universally plant mulberries in the province's fifty-three mountainous counties during the first three years of the Second Five-Year Plan period, and from the fourth year, mobilize agricultural cooperatives and their members to universally raise silkworms. By 1962, based on each member household in mountainous areas raising one silkworm seed sheet, plus those raised in the plains, the province's cocoon production could reach 1,430,000 dan, leaping to second place in the country.

　　The conference believes that the key to rapidly developing silk production lies first and foremost in planting mulberries and restoring tussah forests. In view of the past phenomenon of emphasizing silkworms over mulberries, the conference requires that all regions grasp both mulberries and silkworms in the future, emphasizing both equally, and strive for a great leap forward in silk production.

    抓桑又抓蚕　蚕丝大发展
    五年内将跃居世界第一
    据新华社16日讯　我国蚕丝生产将在第二个五年计划时期飞速跃进。根据这次全国桑蚕柞蚕生产会议上各省代表拟订的初步规划，桑蚕产茧量和产丝量，在五年之内，将超过战前，超过日本，跃居世界第一位。1962年全国桑蚕产茧量可达到战前最高年产量（1931年的四四一点六五万担）一倍，远远超过世界第一产丝国日本。1967年的产量还将远远超过世界曾经有过的最高总产量。
    农业部、对外贸易部、林业部、纺织工业部和全国供销合作总社为促进蚕丝生产联合召开的全国桑蚕柞蚕生产会议，经过十天的讨论已经在13日结束。
    朱副主席在会上讲了话，他说，发展蚕丝生产，对于增加群众收入，扩大就业，供应国内外需要，为国家建设积累资金和换取外汇，都有重大意义。各级党委必须把这个工作重视起来。因为只有各级党委重视领导，才能从上到下地做透关于发展蚕丝生产的宣传教育工作，才能避免重粮轻桑的偏向（重粮是对的，但轻桑是错的），才能在干部、技术和种苗等方面，给群众以支援，才能及时地发现喂养、加工、价格等方面的问题并及时解决这些问题。我国发展蚕丝生产的条件是充分具备的。我国广大农民群众历来有养蚕的经验和习惯，地无分南北都适于养蚕，人无分男女老幼都能够养蚕。因此，我国蚕桑事业的发展是有伟大前途的。在第二个五年计划时期奋起直追，我国的蚕丝生产就一定能够赶过世界上一切产丝的国家。
    会议还听了各地大量的有关种桑、养蚕、放养柞蚕的先进典型经验报告。这些报告说明：合作化以来全国已经出现了一批亩产“千斤叶、百斤茧”的桑园，很多丰产典型。所有这些对各地代表都有极大的鼓舞。会议期间代表们兴奋地拟订了各自省区的蚕丝生产跃进规划。浙江、江苏、四川、广东老桑蚕区要跃进，全国几乎所有省区的桑蚕生产都要跃进，河北、山东、湖南等省的代表提出在十年内赶上或超过老蚕区。生产的柞蚕黑龙江、山西等省的规划也将赶上或超过山东等老区。特别是河北省发展桑蚕的跃进规划在会上起了极大的推动作用。河北将在第二个五年计划时期的前三年，在全省五十三个山区县普遍栽桑，从第四年起发动农业社和社员普遍养蚕。到1962年以山区每户社员养一张蚕种计，加上平原地区所养的，全省产茧就可达到一百四十三万担，跃居全国第二位。
    会议认为：迅速发展蚕丝生产的关键首先在于栽桑和恢复柞林，鉴于过去有过重蚕轻桑的现象，会议要求各地今后抓桑又抓蚕，桑蚕并重，争取蚕丝生产大跃进。
