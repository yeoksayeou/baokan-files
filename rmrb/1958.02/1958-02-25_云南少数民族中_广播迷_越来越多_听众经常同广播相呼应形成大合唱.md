    More and More "Radio Fans" Among Ethnic Minorities in Yunnan
    Listeners Often Echo the Radio, Forming a Grand Chorus

    (Our newspaper Kunming dispatch) The Yunnan People's Broadcasting Station holds regular ethnic language programs for the province's more than 700,000 ethnic minorities in the border areas, which are deeply welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups.

    The radio station began holding irregular ethnic language programs from 1953. At the request of the vast ethnic minorities, Dai language programs were held once every two weeks from June 1956, and recently increased to five times a week; in addition, the radio station holds Lisu language programs once a week. At the same time, it has also focused on developing radio reception and other constructions in ethnic minority areas. At present, these ethnic minority areas have 24 wired broadcasting stations, with a total of 2,695 loudspeakers, and another 561 radio stations, enabling 200,000 people to listen to the radio at the same time. In addition, through mobile organization of radio listening, it is guaranteed that the ethnic minority people in the border areas of this province can often listen to the radio.

    Now, many "radio fans" have emerged among the ethnic minorities in these places. They say, "I can't sleep well if I don't listen to the radio at night." Some Dai farmers in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, after listening to the Dai language program "The Transformation of a Cooperative Director," eliminated misunderstandings about mutual aid and cooperation and joined year-round mutual aid teams. The ethnic minority people in the border areas of the province are particularly happy about broadcasting literary and artistic programs in their own ethnic languages. Ethnic minority people who are good at singing often echo the radio singing in front of the radio loudspeakers, forming a grand chorus of dozens or even hundreds of people.

    云南少数民族中“广播迷”越来越多
    听众经常同广播相呼应形成大合唱
    本报昆明讯　云南省人民广播电台为该省边疆七十多万少数民族举办了定期的民族语言节目，深受各少数民族人民的欢迎。
    该电台从1953年起就开始举办了不定期的民族语言节目。在广大少数民族的要求下，1956年6月举办了两周一次的傣语节目，最近增加到每周五次；另外该电台举办了每周一次的傈僳语节目。同时，还着重发展了少数民族地区的广播收音等建设。目前，这些少数民族地区已有二十四个有线广播站，共带喇叭二千六百九十五只，另外还有五百六十一个收音站，能使二十万人在同一时间内听到广播，加上巡回组织收听广播，就保证了这个省的边疆各少数民族人民能够经常听到广播。
    现在，这些地方的少数民族中出现了不少“广播迷”，他们说：“晚上不听广播，觉也睡不好。”西双版纳傣族自治州一些傣族农民，收听了傣语节目“一个合作社主任的转变”后，消除了对互助合作的误解，参加了常年互助组。该省边疆各少数民族人民对播送他们本民族的文艺节目特别高兴。善长歌唱的少数民族人民在广播喇叭前时常和广播歌声相呼应形成几十人以至几百人的大合唱。
