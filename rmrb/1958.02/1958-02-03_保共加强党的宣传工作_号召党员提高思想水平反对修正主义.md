Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 1st—The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party recently held a meeting to study the Party's ideological work.

　　Grigorov, Minister of Propaganda and Agitation of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, made a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Party's Marxist-Leninist propaganda work has been greatly improved. At present, there are fifteen kinds of Marxist-Leninist courses for study within the Party, while there were only four or five in the past. About 110,000 Party members and non-Party people are studying Marxist-Leninist economic theory and socialist economics, which is twice as many as in 1955. Nearly 70,000 Party members and non-Party activists are studying the current situation of socialist construction in Bulgaria and other socialist countries. He particularly emphasized that the Party's propaganda and political agitation work must wage an irreconcilable struggle against every manifestation of revisionism and bourgeois ideology.

　　Ganev pointed out in his concluding remarks at the meeting that the most important task for every Party member, every Party organization, and the entire Party now is to strengthen the struggle on the ideological front and improve the level of the Party's propaganda work and mass political work.

    号召党员提高思想水平反对修正主义
    据新华社索非亚1日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会最近举行了一个研究党的思想工作的会议。
    保共中央宣传鼓动部长格里戈罗夫在会上作了报告。他指出：党的马克思列宁主义宣传工作大大地改进了。现在，党内学习的马克思列宁主义课程有十五种，而过去只有四、五种。学习马克思列宁主义经济理论和社会主义经济学的党员和非党群众约有十一万人，比1955年多两倍。有近七万党员和非党积极分子正在学习目前保加利亚和其他社会主义国家的社会主义建设状况的问题。他特别强调指出，党的宣传和政治鼓动工作必须同修正主义和资产阶级思想的每一个表现进行不调和的斗争。
    加?夫在会议最后讲话时指出：现在每个党员、每个党组织和全党的最重要的任务就是加强思想战线上的斗争，提高党的宣传工作和群众政治工作水平。
