Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: During the Spring Festival, the capital's markets and transportation hubs are unusually busy, but the phenomenon of people queuing to buy goods and wait for transportation has been greatly reduced, and in most places, queues are no longer seen. This fact shows that as long as we wholeheartedly focus on facilitating the masses and resolutely take effective measures, the phenomenon of queuing can be completely eliminated.
    During the rectification campaign, the Beijing Municipality, in departments closely related to people's lives such as non-staple foods, theaters, hospitals, trains, trams, buses, and service industries such as catering and hairdressing, in accordance with the spirit of "three less, two good, one convenience" (fewer management personnel, lower costs, less waste, better commodity quality, better service attitude, convenience for the masses), while improving business management and breaking outdated rules, emphasized thinking more from the perspective of the masses and less about one's own convenience, thereby adopting measures such as adjusting business hours, strengthening labor allocation, improving operating methods, increasing equipment utilization, and increasing business locations to eliminate queuing by the masses.
    More than one hundred city-owned theaters, hospitals, train stations, long-distance bus stations, and thousands of non-staple food stores and service shops have, according to the characteristics of their businesses, tried their best to adapt to the needs of the masses, adjusted their business hours, some opening earlier or extending business hours, some changing to all-day business, serving customers as soon as they arrive. During festivals and holidays, more than one hundred non-staple food stores located in major residential areas and transportation hubs also added all-night business windows.
    These units have strengthened the allocation of labor, achieving mutual assistance between busy and slack times. Hospitals and theaters have added ticket sales or registration windows. When customers and patients are concentrated, accounting and administrative staff help sell tickets or register. In non-staple food stores, when selling meat and vegetables is busy in the morning, salespersons selling fruits and pastries come to support. During the Spring Festival, the Beijing Railway Bureau and tram and bus companies formed "shock brigades" to support each station. As soon as the number of people queuing increased to more than five, temporary ticket windows were immediately opened, or tickets were taken to the queue to sell. Qianmen Railway Station prepared ten temporary windows, and the long lines of hundreds of people waiting to buy train tickets were reduced to only a dozen people.
    These units also tried to increase equipment utilization and add retail outlets. During peacetime, transportation departments conduct maintenance on some vehicles, but during holidays and festivals, all these reserve vehicles are dispatched for transportation. During this Spring Festival, more than 200 additional trains were added, and the number of long-distance buses increased to 70 to 100 per day. The number of buses and trams increased by one-third, and the bus company borrowed large vehicles scattered in various agencies for unified allocation and use. The non-staple food management department increased the number of temporary stalls, mobile trucks, and organized temporary markets in accordance with market laws. Service industries such as photography and dyeing also added express departments and shortened the time for picking up items.
    Delivering goods and tickets to the door is a prominent phenomenon this year. Many housewives can buy delivered eggs, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar at their doorsteps, and they are very grateful to the salespersons. Some theaters, hospitals, and laundry shops have also launched ticket delivery, item delivery, or telephone appointment services. Before January, the Beijing Railway Bureau notified major universities, factories, and agencies of train schedules and group ticket purchase methods. People who need to buy tickets only need to fill in the date, train number, destination, etc., send someone to buy tickets, or call to register and send someone to deliver them. In this way, 240,000 tickets have been sold in the last half month, saving 240,000 people more than half a day, and reducing the pressure on the station's ticket sales. For passengers who need to transfer to other places in Beijing, the bureau also adopted the method of issuing transfer tickets on the train before it arrives at Beijing Station, so that passengers do not have to rush to queue for visas after arriving at the station.
    Improving operating methods is also an effective measure to overcome queuing. Some non-staple food stores pre-package meat, white sugar, and other goods according to the quantity that customers often buy, and allow customers to directly select vegetables and other goods. This not only reduces the salesperson's temporary rush, but also satisfies customers. The grain supply stations in the eastern suburbs, distributed in rural areas, changed their sales methods to facilitate farmers. In the morning, when farmers go to the fields, they bring their grain purchase certificates and bags to the grain station. The station prepares the grain according to the quantity needed by the farmers, and in the evening, the farmers take it home after work. The outpatient department of the Seventh Municipal Hospital has close cooperation with pharmacists and doctors, mastering the most common disease patterns during this period, and preparing medicines in advance, calculating drug prices, and writing instructions for taking the medicine. This not only allows patients to pick up medicines without queuing, but also allows pharmacists to concentrate their energy on dispensing medicines for special conditions.
    Queuing is something that Beijing citizens have a personal experience with. Before liberation, the vast majority of Beijing citizens had to run from the north of the city to the south of the city to buy a few pounds of mixed flour (inferior grain) to survive. Under the deception of speculators and the threat of police batons, they queued for a whole day, sometimes returning empty-handed. For the vast majority of citizens, eating meat and flour was something they could not afford to queue for, let alone see a play. Today, however, people queue to buy food such as rice, flour, and meat, and to see movies and plays. This is fundamentally different from the situation before liberation. The former is a concentrated manifestation of the universal poverty and misery of the people's lives, while the latter is the result of the universal improvement and improvement of the people's lives. Therefore, queuing today is originally beyond reproach. However, queuing is ultimately not as good as not queuing. At the same time, the existence of queuing also reflects that there are still unreasonable aspects in the business management of various enterprise departments that are closely related to the daily lives of the people. Therefore, many employees of enterprise departments, for the benefit of the working people, resolutely do not allow the queuing phenomenon to exist anymore, which is a further manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system.

### 排队现象完全可以消灭——记北京春节中的新气象

    排队现象完全可以消灭
    ——记北京春节中的新气象
    据新华社20日讯　新华社记者报道：在春节前夕，首都市场和交通运输站异常繁忙，但群众排队等候买货和等候乘车的现象却大大减少，绝大部分地方已经看不到排队行列了。这一事实说明只要一心从便利群众出发，坚决采取有效措施，排队现象是完全可以消灭的。
    在整风运动中，北京市与人民生活有密切关系的副食品、影剧院、医院、火车、电车、公共汽车等部门和饮食、理发等服务性行业，根据“三少、两好、一便利”（管理人员少、费用少、损耗少，商品质量好、服务态度好，便利群众）的精神，在改善经营管理和打破陈旧规章的同时，强调多从群众着想，少图自己方便，从而采取了调整营业时间、加强劳动力调配、改善操作方法、提高设备利用率和增加营业点等措施来消灭群众排队现象。
    市属的一百多个影剧院、医院、火车站、长途汽车站，几千个副食品商店和服务性店铺，都按照自己业务的特点，尽量适应群众的需要，调整了营业时间，有的提早或延长营业时间，有的改为整天营业，顾客随到随接待。在节日和假日，分布在主要居民点和交通要道的一百多家副食品商店还增设了通宵营业窗口。
    这些单位都加强了劳动力调配工作，做到忙闲互济。医院、影剧院增设了售票或门诊挂号窗口，在顾客和病人集中的时候，会计行政工作人员都帮助售票或挂号。副食品商店在上午卖肉卖菜忙的时候，卖水果、糕点的售货员就来支援。在春节期间，北京铁路管理局和电车、汽车公司都把业务人员组成了“突击队”，分别到各站支援，只要排队的人增加到五个以上立即增开临时窗口售票，或者带票到队列里去卖。前门火车站就预备了十个临时窗口，排队候购车票的不再是几百人的长列，一般只有十多人了。
    这些单位还设法提高设备利用率、增设零售点。各交通运输部门，在平日都有一部分车辆在进行保养，一到假日和节日，这些后备车辆即全部出动运输。今年春节期间，就增加了二百多列列车，每天增加到七十至一百多辆长途客车，公共汽车和电车都增加了三分之一，汽车公司还把各机关分散的大型车辆借来，统一调配使用。副食品经营部门按照市场规律，增加了临时货摊、流动货车和组织临时市场。照相洗染等服务性行业还增设了快件部、缩短取件时间。
    送货、送票上门是今年突出的现象。许多家庭主妇在家门口就买到送上门的鸡蛋或油、盐、酱、醋，她们都非常感激售货员。一些影剧院、医院、洗染店也开展了送票、送件或电话预约业务。北京铁路管理局在1月以前，就把列车行车时刻表和集体购票办法通知各大专学校、工厂和机关，需要购买的人只要把日期、车次、到站地点等填写清楚，派一个人去购票，或者打电话登记派人送去就可以了。这样，最近半个月就售出了二十四万张票，使二十四万人少耽误半天以上的时间，也减轻了车站售票的压力。这个局对于需要在北京转乘去外地车辆的旅客，还采用列车未到北京站前，就开始在车上签发转乘车票的办法，使旅客到站后不再匆匆忙忙地去排队签证。
    改善操作方法也是克服排队现象的有效措施之一。一些副食品商店，事前就把肉、白糖等货品按顾客常买的分量分开包好，并且把蔬菜等货品直接让顾客挑选，达样既减省售货员的临时忙乱，又使顾客满意。东郊区粮食供应站分布在农村的各站，为了便利农民，改变了售货办法，早上农民下地时把购粮证、袋子带到粮站来，站上按农民需要的数量把粮食准备好，晚上农民收工后就带回家去。市第七医院的门诊部，药剂员与大夫取得密切协作，掌握这一时期最常见的病情规律，提前把药配出来，算好药价，写好服法说明，这样不但可使病人取药不排队，药剂员还可以把精力集中去调配特殊病情的药。
    排队，对北京市民来说有着切身的体会。解放前，北京广大市民为了买到几斤活命的混合面（低劣的粮食），从北城跑到南城，在投机商的欺诈和警棍的淫威下，排了一整天队，有时还是两手空空地回去。对于吃肉吃面粉，广大市民是排不起队的，更不用说看戏了。而今天人们排队却是为了购买大米、白面和肉等食品，为了看上电影看上戏，这和解放前情况有着本质的不同，前者是人民生活普遍穷困悲惨的集中表现，后者是人民生活普遍改善提高的结果。因此在今天排排队，本来也是无可厚非的。但是，排队毕竟不如不排队好，同时排队现象的存在，也反映了与人民群众日常生活关系密切的各企业部门经营管理上还有不够合理的地方。因此许多企业部门的职工为了劳动人民群众的利益，坚决不让排队现象再存在下去，这正是社会主义制度的优越性的进一步表现。
