    △The heart weighs approximately less than half a pound, and is about the size of a fist. But its work is amazing. The work it does in one hour can lift itself to a height of six thousand feet; the work it does in twenty-four hours can lift a thirty-two ton object one foot. The heart can do approximately 177,000 foot-pounds of work in a lifetime.
    △Each time the heart beats, it pumps about 4 1/2 ounces of blood. It takes a minimum of fifteen seconds for each drop of blood to circulate throughout the body, with an average of forty-five seconds. Each drop of blood travels approximately one mile per day, and if a person lives for seventy years, it can travel 25,000 miles.

    △心脏的重量大约不超过半磅，大小像一个拳头。但它的工作很惊人。它在一小时内所做的工，可以把它自身升高到六千英呎的高处；在二十四小时里所做的工，可以把三十二吨重的物体升高一呎。心脏一生大约可以做到十七万七千呎磅的工作。
    △人每次心跳，自心挤出的血液量约有41／2英两。每滴血液循环全身一次费时最短为十五秒钟，平均是四十五秒钟。每滴血每日大约能流行一哩，如在人生七十年中，它能流过二万五千哩。
