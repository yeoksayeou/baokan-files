Xinhua News Agency, Jinggangshan, February 8th: The entire population of Jinggangshan wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 3rd, firmly stating that they would achieve the grain target of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) nine years ahead of schedule. In 1958, the grain yield per unit area would reach 834 jin, and the net income per person would reach 160 yuan.

The letter stated: In the more than eight years since regaining liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Jinggangshan Township transformed from a grain-deficient township into a grain-surplus township in 1955. In 1957, the total grain output of the township had increased threefold compared to before liberation, and the grain yield per unit area increased from an average of over 180 jin per mu before liberation to 366 jin. New records of 1,002 jin to 1,027 jin per mu had emerged in the Peace and Xiangzhou cooperatives. The lives of the people throughout the township have been greatly improved.

However, we will never be complacent because of this. After studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and after discussion, the entire township will basically realize double cropping in 1958, with a yield of 834 jin per mu, and ensure that the entire township has cooperatives yielding 1,000 jin, every cooperative has a team yielding 1,000 jin, every team has a group yielding 1,000 jin, and every group has a mu yielding 1,000 jin. At the same time, diversify operations, increasing the net income per person in the township from more than 70 yuan in 1957 to over 160 yuan, achieving prosperity. Although we are in a mountainous area with towering peaks, strong winds, cold water, and heavy frost and snow, we have already had examples of yields of 800 jin and 1,000 jin per mu. As long as we double our efforts, it is entirely possible to achieve an average yield of over 800 jin per mu throughout the township in 1958. Now, we have fully repaired water conservancy facilities and completed winter plowing to eliminate pests, with an average of more than 310 dan of fertilizer accumulated per male and female laborer. In this surging tide of the Great Leap Forward, the spirit of the old revolutionary comrades, who are not afraid of difficulties and hardships, encourages and educates us. Cai Wenming, the Soviet financial and grain committee member during the land revolution, who is now 79 years old, and old revolutionaries such as Zou Wenjie, Zou Wen'er, and Lan Yaqi, who are all over 50 years old, are plowing the fields in the snow. They will always be role models for us to learn from.

The letter concluded: Respected Chairman Mao! We will always remember your teachings, maintain glory, and carry forward glory.

### 井冈山人民向毛主席报告  今年实现农业纲要粮食指标

    井冈山人民向毛主席报告
    今年实现农业纲要粮食指标
    据新华社井冈山8日电　井冈山全体人民在3日写信给毛主席，坚决表示他们要提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）粮食指标，1958年粮食单位面积产量达到八百三十四斤，每人纯收入达到一百六十元。
    信上说：在重获解放的八年多来，在党的领导下，井冈山乡1955年起由缺粮乡变成了余粮乡。1957年全乡粮食总产量已比解放前增加了三倍，粮食单位面积产量由解放前每亩平均一百八十多斤提高到三百六十六斤，和平、湘洲两社还出现了亩产一千零二斤到一千零二十七斤的新纪录。全乡人民的生活已大大地得到改善和提高。
    但是，我们决不因此而有丝毫的自满。我们学习了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），经过讨论，全乡要在1958年基本实现双季化，亩产八百三十四斤，并做到全乡有千斤社，社社有千斤队，队队有千斤组，组组有千斤亩。同时开展多种经营，全乡每人纯收入由1957年的七十多元达到一百六十元以上，实现富裕化。虽然我们这里是个崇山峻岭、风劲水冷、霜雪很大的山区，但是我们已经有了亩产八百斤、一千斤的事例，只要加倍的努力，1958年达到全乡平均亩产八百多斤是完全可能的。现在，我们已经全面修理好水利，完成了冬耕灭虫，每个男女劳力平均积肥三百一十多担。在这跃进的浪潮中，老革命同志的不畏艰难困苦的精神鼓舞和教育着我们。现在已经七十九岁、土地革命时期的苏维埃财粮委员蔡文明，年纪都在五十岁以上的老革命邹文阶、邹文而、蓝亚七等同志，都冒雪犁田。他们永远都是我们学习的榜样。
    信的最后说：敬爱的毛主席！我们一定永远记住您的教导，保持光荣、发挥光荣。
