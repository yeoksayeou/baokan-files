    Electron Microscopes Unveil the Curtain of the Microscopic World
    Guo Yishi
    Those invisible microorganisms, atoms, and molecules are, in fact, important actors in the natural world. Without understanding them, people cannot escape disease, nor can they turn those magical technological fantasies into reality.
    Mankind began the activity of exploring the secrets of the microscopic world.
    Magnifying glasses appeared. But what good is magnification of only ten or twenty times!?
    Optical microscopes appeared. They can magnify objects two thousand times, allowing people to see some microorganisms and the surface structure of metals.
    Inside the optical microscope, there are several lenses. Each additional lens magnifies the image of the object. So, would more lenses allow us to delve deeper into the microscopic world? No. When objects are much smaller than two-thousandths of a millimeter, optical microscopes are powerless. Those objects are too small; due to the diffraction of light, the magnified image is very blurred. Even if one can barely see them, they are nothing more than extremely tiny black dots. Therefore, although optical microscopes can see bacteria, they cannot clearly see the internal details of bacteria; although they can see the structure of metals, it is only a rough, superficial view, not thorough or detailed.
    When light is helpless, electrons come to help.
    How do electrons help? Let's do an experiment.
    Place your hand under a lamp or strong sunlight. Because the hand blocks the light, a shadow of the hand is cast on the table. This is similar to the principle of how optical microscopes display matter.
    Place your hand under a fine sieve, and evenly sift fine sand through the sieve. Because the hand blocks the fine sand, you can soon see the "shadow" of the hand on the table. This is similar to the function of electron microscopes. Here, fine sand replaces light. The key is the fine sand, which is much smaller than the hand. If large pebbles are sifted down, there will be no hand shadow.
    Electrons, on the other hand, are not only smaller than microorganisms, but also much smaller than the smallest particles of matter—atoms and molecules. Of course, electrons are our best "fine sand."
    Let's go back to light. If you compare it with the smallest particles of matter, they are simply some "pebbles." If you want to use these "pebbles" to create images, it's a "dead end," with no hope at all.
    So, how do these "fine sand" electrons reveal the "light at the end of the tunnel" for us?
    The electron microscope is quite an extraordinary instrument. Look at it: taller than a person, wearing a steel helmet and metal armor (even the things inside its belly are mostly made of metal). It stands firmly at its post, dutifully performing its duties, unwavering.
    From the top of the electron microscope, an electron gun emits a stream of electrons downwards. A condenser lens focuses this stream of electrons on the object being observed, and then a preliminary magnified image is obtained through an objective lens. After passing through a projector lens, the electron stream strikes a fluorescent screen, displaying the final magnified image.
    The "lenses" here are, of course, not made of optical glass, but coils that become magnetic when electricity passes through them. These magnetic coils act as "lenses," so they are also called lenses.
    In simple terms, this is the structure and magnification principle of the electron microscope.
    Electron microscopes can magnify objects five thousand, one hundred thousand, or even two hundred thousand times. At this point, not only can those invisible microscopic objects be peered at, but also ordinary things that are easily visible show extraordinary appearances. For example, now you see many mountains and rocks on the fluorescent screen. Where is this? Is it a television broadcast from the surface of the moon? No! It turns out to be the surface of that shiny, mirror-like small knife blade.
    Many diseases are truly vexing. Doctors and biologists clearly know that there are "ghosts" involved, but even with the best optical microscopes, they cannot find their踪影. The "filterable viruses" that cause influenza are such "ghosts." They are so small that they can even penetrate porcelain bottles. But if they encounter an electron microscope, they have no choice but to reveal their true forms. In this way, we can identify the pathogens of many diseases.
    With electron microscopes, chemists can further study blood, loess, cotton, silk, rubber, and various micro-dusts. Find many new secrets of the microscopic world, so that mankind can become "omnipotent" in manufacturing all kinds of magical substances.
    With electron microscopes, physicists and engineers can see clearly the changes in metals during smelting and processing, and study better smelting and processing methods.
    The work of exploring the microscopic world is very important. Without this work, there would be no rockets or artificial satellites. Because electron microscopes can help metallurgists uncover the secrets of metal structures, allowing them to understand how to mix various metals in order to "cook up" alloys that suit the "taste" of rockets and artificial satellites.
    This research work in the microscopic world is very important, and this work shows that there is no end to mankind's understanding of the material world.
    The optical microscope is already an old man of over three hundred years old, but it is still "old but vigorous," and "striving for perfection."
    The electron microscope is only a youth in its twenties. No one can imagine what wonders will appear after it continues to unveil the curtain of the microscopic world.

    揭开微小世界之幕的电子显微镜
    郭以实
    那看不见的微生物和原子、分子，却是自然界的重要演员。不认识它们，人们就不可能摆脱疾病，不可能把那神奇的技术幻想变为现实。
    人类就开始了探索微小世界的秘密的活动。
    放大镜出现了。但放大一、二十倍又有多大用处呢！？
    光学显微镜出现了。它可以把物体放大两千倍，使人能够看到一些微生物和金属的表面构造了。
    在光学显微镜里面，有着几片透镜。透镜多一片，物体的形象便放大一次。那么，是不是透镜愈多，就愈能深入微小世界呢？不行。当物体比二千分之一毫米还小得多时，光学显微镜就无能为力了。那些物体过于细小，由于光的绕射，使得放大的物像十分模糊。即使能勉强看见，也不过是一粒极细的黑点罢了。因此，光学显微镜虽能看见细菌，但却看不清细菌内部的详情；虽能看到金属的结构，那也只是个大概，而且是表面的情况，不透彻，不详细。
    在光线无可奈何的时候，电子出来帮忙了。
    电子怎样帮忙？我们不妨来做一个实验。
    把手掌放在电灯或是强烈的阳光下，由于手掌挡住了光线，在桌上印上了手掌的影子。这好比光学显微镜能显示物质的道理。
    把手掌放在一个细筛底下，从细筛中均匀地筛下细沙。由于手掌挡住了细沙，不久，也可以在桌上看见手掌的“影子”了。这就好比电子显微镜的作用。在这里，细沙代替了光线。关键就在这比手掌小得多的细沙。如果筛下来的是许多小石块，那就不会有手影。
    电子呢，它不仅比微生物小，而且比物质的最小的微粒——原子、分子还小得多。当然，电子就成了我们最好的“细沙”了。
    再回头来看看光线。如果把它和物质的最小微粒一比，简直是一些“石块”。若要用这些“石块”来显影，那真是“山穷水尽”，毫无希望。
    那么，电子这些“细沙”又是怎样为我们揭开“柳暗花明”的境界的呢？
    电子显微镜的仪表颇不平凡。你看它：比人还高，头戴钢盔帽，身穿金属盔甲袍（连它肚子里的东西多半也是金属做的）。它屹立在自己的岗位上，严肃地尽忠职守，从不动摇。
    从电子显微镜的头顶上，电子枪往下射出一束电子流。会聚透镜把这束电子流集中在观察物上，然后通过接物透镜就得出了初步的放大像。再经过投射透镜，电子流就射在荧光屏上，显出最后的放大形象。
    这里的“透镜”，当然不是光学玻璃做的，而是通电后即带磁力的线圈。这些磁力线圈起着“透镜”的作用，所以也把它们叫作透镜。
    简单说来，电子显微镜的构造和放大原理，就是这样。
    电子显微镜能把物体放大到五千、十万倍以至二十万倍。这时候，不仅那些看不见的微小物体能够被人窥见了，而且，平常那些容易看得见的东西，也显出了非凡的面貌。比方说，现在你看，在荧光屏上显出许多山岩。这是什么地方？是从月球表面上传来的电视吗？不！原来是那光亮如镜的小刀片的表面。
    有许多病，的确伤脑筋。医生和生物学家明明知道其中有“鬼”，但用最好的光学显微镜，也找不着它的踪影。引起流行性感冒的“过滤性毒”，就是这样的“鬼”。它们小得连瓷瓶都能钻过去。但是如果一遇到电子显微镜，它们就不得不原形毕露。这样，我们便可以找出许多种病的病原体。
    化学家有了电子显微镜，就可以进一步研究血液、黄土、棉、丝、橡胶和各种微尘。找出微小世界的许多新的秘密，使人类成为能制造各种神奇物质的“万能者”。
    物理学家和工程师有了电子显微镜，就可以看清金属在冶炼和加工时的变化，研究出更好的冶炼和加工的方法。
    探索微小世界的工作十分重要。没有这些工作，也就没有火箭与人造卫星。因为电子显微镜能帮助冶金学家揭穿金属结构的秘密，使他们明白要怎样调配各种金属，才能“烹调”出适合火箭与人造卫星的口味的合金。
    这微小世界的研究工作十分重要，这工作说明了人类对物质世界的认识没有止境。
    光学显微镜已经是三百多岁的老头子了，但它还是“老当益壮”，“精益求精”。
    电子显微镜还只是二十几岁的青年。谁也不能料想，在它不断地揭开微小世界之幕以后，究竟会出现怎样的奇景。
