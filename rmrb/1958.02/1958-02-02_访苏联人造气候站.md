Visiting the Soviet Artificial Climate Station

　　In Ostankino, a suburb of Moscow, there is a wonderful botanical garden. It is a miniature of the various climatic conditions across the vast territory of the Soviet Union, concentrating climates from the Arctic Ocean coast in the north to the Black Sea coast in the south. Here, there is the permafrost zone of the north, the hot winds of the lower Volga River, as well as the "Hungry Steppe" and arid deserts of Central Asia. In this plant kingdom, people study the life patterns of plants under different climatic conditions to increase crop yields. They aim to settle southern crops in the north, grow apples in the severe cold, and find a second home for subtropical plants in the north. This fantastic, fairytale-like place is the Soviet Artificial Climate Station, led by Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Comrade Tumanov.

　　Recently, during the harsh winter days in Moscow, we visited this climate station. When we stepped into the first laboratory, we felt time suddenly turn before our eyes: it was not the frigid January but the height of summer in July. Cucumbers were cultivated in the laboratory, their stems and leaves tender green and very robust. Looking up, we saw that the "summer" in the room was artificially created: rows of sun lamps were installed on the ceiling and walls, and gusts of humid, hot air blew out from the ventilation holes in the walls. Using instrument adjustments, the room maintained a climate consistent with the day and night, morning and evening, of summer.

　　Leaving this laboratory and entering another next door, autumn, with its refreshing golden breeze, immediately began. The climate here was cool and pleasant, and many woody plants were growing vigorously. Another laboratory had a dry climate, much like the situation in the lower Volga River when it encountered drought. The hot wind could make a person's hair flutter. In another laboratory, there were many large refrigerator-like cabinets, with temperatures as low as seventy degrees below zero. What were these cabinets used for? It turned out that many subtropical plants and fruit trees were placed inside to test and train their cold resistance. Researching and cultivating the cold resistance of crops is of great significance, because in some areas of the Soviet Union, large areas of winter crops often freeze to death in severe winters. According to the research of the scientists at the artificial climate station, apple trees can withstand severe cold of minus forty to fifty degrees without freezing to death.

　　We also saw a very rare phenomenon in another laboratory. Many plants can grow without soil in gravel and pebbles soaked in nutrient solutions. Scientists are studying the use of this method to increase the yield of vegetables and other crops.

　　Here, there are climates for all four seasons at any time. How is the climate "artificially" created? We asked the scientists at the climate station with great interest. They replied: The climate on Earth is determined by factors such as the intensity of sunlight, air humidity, and wind force. Generating these elements with mechanical equipment can "reproduce" the dramatically different climates from the far northern borders of the Soviet Union to the mountains of the South Caucasus in the laboratory. Sunlight is replaced by various types of sun lamps, and temperature and wind force are "produced" by automatically adjusted mechanical equipment. Before entering the artificial climate station, the air is first compressed and filtered, and then moistened or dried, heated or cooled using special equipment. Finally, the air is pressed into the laboratory along pipelines. In this way, we can obtain the artificial climate that meets our requirements in the laboratory.

　　The climate station has been established for nearly a year. In this short period, scientists' efforts have achieved remarkable results. Botanists have found chemical agents that accelerate or delay plant growth, and found methods to prevent potatoes from sprouting during storage and reducing vitamins, reducing the losses suffered by potatoes during storage to one-third of what they were in the past. Now, scientists are conducting scientific exploration and research in this new direction with greater theoretical and practical significance.

　　访苏联人造气候站
    在莫斯科北郊奥斯坦金地方，有一座奇妙的植物园。它是苏联辽阔广大的领土上各种气候条件的缩影，北至北冰洋沿岸、南至黑海之滨的气候都集中在这里。这里有北方长年的冻土带、伏尔加河下游的热风，也有中亚细亚的“饥饿草原”和干渴的沙漠。在这个植物王国里，人们研究着植物在不同气候条件下的生活规律，提高作物收获量，他们要让南方的作物在北方定居，让苹果在严寒下生长，让亚热带植物在北方找到第二故乡。这个像童话般奇幻的地方就是苏联科学院通讯院士图曼诺夫同志领导的苏联人造气候站。
    最近，在莫斯科严冬的日子里，我们访问了这个气候站。当我们踏进了第一间试验室的时候，觉得时间在我们眼前猛然一转：现在不是寒气凛冽的一月而是七月盛夏时节了。试验室里培育的是黄瓜，黄瓜的茎叶嫩绿，十分茁壮。我们抬头一看，原来室内的“夏天”是用机器制造出来的：顶棚和墙壁上安装着一排排的太阳灯，从壁上的通风孔吹出一阵阵润湿的热风。利用仪器的调节，室内保持着和夏天的昼夜、早晚相适应的气候。
    我们离开这个试验室走进隔壁另一个试验室的时候，立刻又开始了金风送爽的秋天。这里气候凉爽宜人，许多木本植物在蓬勃生长。另一个试验室里是干燥的气候，很像伏尔加河下游遇到干旱时的情景，热风能够把人的头发吹得飘舞起来。在另一间试验室里，排列着许多大冰箱式的厨柜，里面温度低到零下七十度。这些厨柜作什么用呢？原来里面放着许多亚热带植物和果树等，用来试验和锻炼它们的耐寒性。研究和培养作物的抗寒性有很重要意义。因为苏联某些地区常有大片面积的过冬作物在严冬时受冻死亡。据人造气候站科学家们的研究，苹果树可以抵抗零下四十度至五十度的严寒而不至冻死。
    我们在另一个试验室里还看到一件很稀奇的现象。许多植物不用土壤而能在用营养液浸过的砂砾卵石中生长。科学家们正在研究利用这种方法来提高蔬菜及其他作物的收获量。
    这里，任何时候都有一年四季的气候。气候是怎样“人造”出来呢？我们怀着巨大的兴趣询问气候站的科学家们。他们回答说：地球上的气候是由阳光照射强度、空气湿度、风力等要素来决定的。用机器设备来产生这些要素便能将从苏联的极北边疆到南高加索群山的迥然不同气候在实验室中“复制”出来。阳光照射用各式各样太阳灯来代替，气温和风力则由自动调节的机器设备“生产”出来。空气在进入人造气候站之前，首先用压气机和空气滤净，然后利用特制的设备使空气湿润或干燥，变热或变冷。最后，把空气沿管道压进实验室。这样，我们便能在实验室内得到符合我们要求的人造气候了。
    气候站成立以来将近一年了。在这短短的时期中，科学家们的努力已取得显著成就。植物学家找到了加速或延缓植物生长的化学药剂，找到防止土豆在贮藏时因发芽而减少维他命的方法，使土豆在贮藏时所遭受的损失减少到过去的三分之一。现在，科学家们正朝着这个新的方向进行着有更重大的理论和实践意义的科学探索和研究。
