Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 23rd: Gansu Province, in vigorously developing local industries, has broken with convention and acted decisively. Fifty factories and mines in nine counties and cities have already commenced production.

These counties and cities include: Wushan County, Huining County, Cheng County, Qin'an County, and Huichuan County, etc. The construction of these factories prominently embodies the principle of being oriented towards rural areas, serving agricultural production, and serving the lives of the broad masses. Huining County, located in a mountainous area, urgently needed to solve its fuel problem and had abundant mineral resources, so it first opened four small coal mines. Pingliang City utilized potatoes to open a winery. The iron and wood farm tool repair and assembly plant in Qingshui County and the foundry in Qin'an County were both built to meet the needs of local agricultural production. After the soap factory in Huichuan County went into production, it solved the problem of untimely soap supply and high prices in the past, and its products were loved by the local people.

The construction of these factories did not use state investment, but was entirely self-financed by local authorities and raised by the masses. In terms of business operations, some were cooperative ventures between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, with one providing equipment and the other providing labor. Some first obtained advance payments from customers as capital, and then repaid the debts after producing products and accumulating funds. Some were collectively invested in factories by handicraft cooperatives. Others were self-financed locally, with cadres transferred to work as workers and managers.

Now, the second batch of hundreds of factories, mines, and hydroelectric power stations in these nine counties and cities have either already started construction or are being prepared, and will soon be put into production.

    雷厉风行　说干就干
    甘肃九个县市已有五十个厂矿投入生产，数百个厂矿动工
    新华社兰州23日电　甘肃省在大力发展地方工业中，打破常规，说办就办，现在已经有九个县市的五十个厂矿投入了生产。
    这些县市是：武山县、会宁县、成县、秦安县、会川县等。这批工厂的建设，突出地体现了面向农村、为农业生产服务和为广大人民生活服务的方针。地处山区的会宁县，燃料问题需要迫切解决，并且矿产资源丰富，就首先开采了四处小煤窑；平凉市把洋芋利用起来开办了酒厂；清水县的铁木农具修配厂、秦安县的翻砂厂，都是为满足当地农业生产的需要而兴建的。会川县的肥皂厂投入生产后，解决了过去肥皂供应不及时和价格高的问题，产品受到当地群众的喜爱。
    这一批工厂的建设，没有使用国家投资，完全是地方自筹和群众集资兴建的。在经营方式上，有的是供销社与农业社合作，一家出设备，一家出劳动力；有的先从顾主那里预支款作为资金，制出产品和有积累后，再还账；有的是手工业社集体投资办工厂；有的是地方自筹、下放干部当工人和管理人员。
    现在这九个县市的第二批数百个厂矿、水电站，有的已经动工，有的正在筹备，不久都可投入生产。
