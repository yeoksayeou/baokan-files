We wholeheartedly support the four reports by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Director Wu Yuzhang. Now we would like to express some opinions on developing China's dairy industry and solving the problem of infant food.

During the first five-year plan, the annual output of dairy products increased by 17.4 times, and the annual output of milk substitutes increased by 16.9 times. However, due to the rapid increase in social needs, the supply of dairy products and milk substitutes has still fallen short of demand in recent years.

Over the past few years, with the development of China's socialist construction and the continuous improvement and elevation of people's living standards, coupled with the employment of women in cities and the participation of a large number of rural women in labor production, many infants need artificial or mixed feeding. This has greatly increased the demand for dairy products, milk powder, and various milk substitutes, and the dairy products (including milk powder) industry and milk substitute industry have also developed accordingly. In 1952, China's dairy product output was 624 tons (including 463 tons of milk powder), which increased to 10,863 tons in 1957 (including 4,520 tons of milk powder), an increase of 17.4 times compared with 1952 (including an increase of 8.7 times for milk powder). The total output of milk substitutes (including milk substitute powder and milk substitute cake) in 1952 was 426 tons, which increased to 7,616 tons in 1957, an increase of 16.9 times compared with 1952.

Although China's dairy products and milk substitutes industries have developed rapidly, their development speed is far from being able to adapt to the rapidly increasing social needs, especially the need for infant food. This situation has been most prominent since the second half of 1956, and a serious shortage of milk powder has occurred throughout the country. This has caused great social reaction. Many mothers wrote letters and called newspaper offices, people's committees, and production and sales departments. Some even attached photos of their children. More than a few mothers, unable to buy milk powder, placed their children on the counters of shops and supply stations, refusing to take them away, demanding a supply of milk powder. This tight supply situation has not yet been fundamentally resolved. For example, in the fourth quarter of 1957, the commercial departments' demand for milk powder was 1,383 tons, while the industrial departments could only meet 490 tons. Finally, a portion was imported from Denmark to supplement the market supply.

As everyone knows, milk powder and condensed milk (unsweetened evaporated milk) in dairy product output are not only ideal foods to replace human milk for infant feeding, but also the best food for patients and the vast majority of adults. The cold drink and pastry industries also need a large amount of milk powder. Lactose is an important culture medium for the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture penicillin and chloramphenicol. Butter and casein can meet the large needs of the domestic people, domestic industry, and exports. In 1957, the total dairy product output was 10,863 tons, including 4,520 tons of milk powder, 4,769 tons of condensed milk, 836 tons of butter, 336 tons of lactose, and 402 tons of casein. In recent years, the quantities of these products have been unable to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets.

Recently, the Ministry of Food Industry, based on the data from relevant departments, made a calculation regarding the needs for milk powder and milk substitutes for infants and other needs. This made us realize that the current and especially future social needs will continue to increase. The national infant birth rate is approximately 3.2 percent. Based on this, the number of infants under one year old is 19.14 million annually. According to investigations by the health departments in several major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu, approximately 66 percent of infants under one year old are breastfed, 5 percent are artificially fed (without any breast milk), and 29 percent are mixed-fed (insufficient breast milk). In rural areas, it is estimated that 3 percent of infants need artificial feeding and 5 percent need mixed feeding. Therefore, not including the needs of toddlers over one year old, patients, and the cold drink and pastry food industry, the cities need approximately 12,000 tons of milk powder annually (calculated at 48 percent of the total usage) and 12,600 tons of milk substitutes (calculated at 52 percent of the total usage). The rural areas need approximately 10,100 tons of milk powder annually (calculated at 30 percent of the total usage) and 22,300 tons of milk substitutes (calculated at 70 percent of the total usage). Of the above-mentioned quantities for infant consumption, apart from a portion that can be supplied with fresh milk in a few large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the majority still needs to be solved by producing milk powder and milk substitutes. This demand will become even more urgent in the future. In addition to the general infant consumption, it is estimated that infants born in maternity hospitals and all patients currently need approximately 1,500 tons of milk powder annually, and the cold drink and pastry industry needs 3,600 tons of milk powder. The output of butter in 1958 is estimated to be 1,400 tons, which is still in short supply. 2,000 tons of lactose and 1,200 tons of casein are needed. If production can be greatly increased, exports can be actively organized to earn foreign exchange to support the country's industrial and agricultural construction. Therefore, a great leap forward in the development of the dairy products and milk substitutes industries should receive full attention from all parties.

The following are some opinions on the development of dairy products and milk substitutes:

(1) Regarding the Development of Dairy Products

All parts of the country have favorable conditions for developing dairy cattle and sheep husbandry; there are still many scattered milk sources that have not been utilized.

In northern and northwestern China, there are large grasslands and vast pastoral areas, with a large number of yellow cattle, yaks, and crossbred cattle; in the south, there is green grass that does not wither all year round, raising many water buffaloes and yellow cattle. The fresh milk produced by dairy cattle in various places, apart from a few areas with dairy factories organizing industrial processing, the dairy product processing industry in most areas, especially in areas with scattered milk sources, is still a blank slate. For example, the Inner Mongolia region is estimated to produce 200,000 tons of fresh milk annually, but currently only 26,000 tons are utilized by industrial processing, a utilization rate of only 13 percent; in Shuifeng Township, Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Gansu Province, there are more than 7,000 dairy cows within a radius of ten kilometers, but no processing has been organized yet; there are approximately 670,000 dairy cows in the entire Xinjiang region, and there are 14,686 dairy cows in three state-owned pastoral areas. In a local state-owned farm eight kilometers from Jinghe County, Xinjiang, there are also 4,081 dairy cows. The fresh milk produced by these dairy cows, apart from extracting a small amount of cream, is mostly not utilized. There is currently no dairy processing plant in the entire Xinjiang region; furthermore, Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, currently has 5,227 dairy cows, including 1,080 improved breed cows. Currently, they are only used for plowing or selling, and milking is not utilized. In addition, near Dengchuan County, Yunnan, 5 to 7 tons of fresh milk can be collected daily, and near Zhangzhou City, Fujian, 8 tons of fresh milk can be collected monthly, but they are not fully utilized. In the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang, water buffaloes are used for both plowing and milking. They have long-term experience in using water buffalo milk to process dairy products, and have achieved excellent results. In addition to cow's milk, there is also a large amount of goat's milk in China that has not been utilized. According to a recent survey by relevant departments, there are approximately 5 million goats and 4.4 million cattle in Yunnan Province. The province's farmers make milk fans from cow and goat milk for sale. From this, it can be seen that all parts of the country have favorable conditions for developing dairy cattle and sheep, but the current situation is that many scattered milk sources have not been utilized, or are being wasted. Therefore, we believe that:

The dairy products industry should also have a great leap forward, with close cooperation between large, medium, and small dairy product processing enterprises to fully utilize the scattered milk sources.

First, there should be a production great leap forward in the dairy products industry. Strive to fully utilize the existing scattered milk sources within one or two years, universally establish dairy product processing plants and processing stations, and eliminate blank spots.

At the recent national technical experience exchange meeting on dairy products and milk substitutes held by the Ministry of Food Industry, it was agreed that the following methods can be adopted to eliminate blank spots:

(1) Establish small-scale dairy product factories with flat-bottom pan equipment in areas with scattered milk sources and inconvenient transportation. According to the experience of Heilongjiang Province in 1957 in developing a large number of flat-bottom pan processing plants, building a flat-bottom pan processing plant that handles one to two tons of fresh milk day and night in two shifts only requires an investment of 15,000 yuan and can be put into production in two or three months. In 1957, Heilongjiang Province invested only 200,000 yuan to build 42 processing plants (more than 130 flat-bottom pans), and produced approximately 300 tons of dairy products that year. The investment was recovered within half a year. Adopting flat-bottom pan production can cultivate milk sources, increase milk production, and create conditions for building large and medium-sized factories with advanced equipment in the future. For example, in Beian County, Heilongjiang Province, there were more than 600 dairy cows in 1955, but the number was reduced to 300 due to the inability to sell the milk. After building eight flat-bottom pans to organize processing in 1957, the number of dairy cows increased to 600 within one year. Before Zhaoyuan County established a processing plant, a cow was sold for 30 yuan. After the plant was built in 1957, the price increased to 100 yuan. In addition, there are many benefits such as increasing farmers' income, utilizing the labor force of agricultural cooperatives, and strengthening the relationship between workers and peasants. The quality of milk powder produced by flat-bottom pans can meet the standards for the pastry, frozen drink, and other industries, and can even meet the infant consumption standard.

(2) Close cooperation between large, medium, and small dairy product processing enterprises. In addition to establishing flat-bottom pan equipment, it is also very important to establish milk collection stations and semi-finished product processing stations around large factories in order to expand milk sources, ensure output quality, and shorten the downtime season of large factories.

It is recommended that leading organs at all levels give strong support in terms of investment, equipment, cadres, and infrastructure to the issue of developing dairy products and fully utilizing milk sources, so as to strive to fully utilize this batch of nutritious and high-quality food as soon as possible, provide a sufficient supply to continuously improve the people's living welfare, create more wealth for the country, and accumulate more funds.

Vigorously develop dairy cattle husbandry, improve dairy cattle breeds, and increase the milk yield per unit of dairy cattle.

Second, develop dairy cattle husbandry. Developing the dairy industry must actively develop dairy cattle, improve dairy cattle breeds, increase the milk yield per unit of dairy cattle, extend the lactation period, and correspondingly strengthen the feeding management of dairy cattle, solve the dairy cattle's feed, cowsheds, and epidemic prevention, etc. These tasks cannot be completed by the industrial departments alone. We must ask the relevant departments in various places to give strong support, strengthen the leadership of the dairy cattle industry, and closely cooperate with the industrial, agricultural, animal husbandry, and health departments. It can only be solved through joint efforts.

(1) Strengthening Feeding Management. According to the data of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the North Manchurian cattle only produce more than 2,000 kilograms of milk per year when raised along the Binzhou line, while the same breed of dairy cattle raised at the Shuangqiao Farm in Beijing produce an average of 4,700 kilograms of milk during a lactation period. The main reason is that Beijing provides more feed for the North Manchurian cattle and has built cowsheds. However, at present, the solution of dairy cattle feed and the construction of cowsheds are generally not given enough attention in various places. For example, in some areas of Inner Mongolia, dairy cattle cannot get refined feed, and in the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang, dairy cattle are sometimes not given refined feed either. In terms of cowsheds, many dairy cattle in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang spend the winter in the ice and snow at minus 40 degrees Celsius, with very little cowshed equipment. The milk production of these dairy cattle is greatly reduced or even stopped in winter. If these problems are not properly resolved, it will not only affect the increase in milk production of dairy cattle and the normalization of factory production, but also damage the physical fitness of dairy cattle. In addition, the problem of dairy cattle diseases and epidemics is also very serious. Many areas of cattle suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis and abortion. We ask the local competent departments to make overall arrangements for the feed, cowsheds, and epidemic prevention of dairy cattle.

(2) In major cities and industrial and mining areas, various food industry waste materials, such as bean cake, wheat bran, fruit peels, and vegetables, should be used to raise dairy cattle to supply milk for the citizens. For example, Beijing currently raises 7,800 dairy cows, an increase of more than two times compared with 1952. Shanghai has developed from 8,400 in 1956 to 10,500, which has played a great role in meeting the needs of the people. However, cities raising dairy cattle should strictly implement disinfection equipment to ensure fresh milk hygiene, and establish the necessary processing equipment for when there is a lot of milk in the peak season to avoid waste.

(3) Improve dairy cattle breeds. At present, the fresh milk used by China's dairy products industry mainly relies on three types of dairy cows: in Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, the main types are Sanhe cattle and improved breed dairy cattle, with a milk production of generally 2,000 to 3,000 kilograms during a lactation period; in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and other places, the main type is water buffalo, with a milk production of generally 500 to 600 kilograms during a lactation period; in Qinghai, Gansu, and other places, the main types are pastoral yellow cattle, yaks, and crossbred cattle, with a milk production of approximately 250 to 400 kilograms during a lactation period. There is a very large difference in the milk production of the three types of cattle. It can be seen that improving dairy cattle breeds is a fundamental and important measure for developing the dairy industry. The experience of Qinyuan County, Shanxi Province, in changing the breed of yellow cattle proves that the cattle after the breed change not only produce more milk, but also have greater strength for plowing. The masses call the breed-changed cattle "Dutch cattle (actually referring to the breed-changed cattle) are so cute, they grow thick, develop quickly, have great strength, can produce milk, are of high value, and are treasures of farm families." According to the above experience, it is proven that it is not only necessary but also possible for China to improve the existing cattle breeds. Doing so will not only promote the development of the dairy industry, but also stimulate the development of animal husbandry and agriculture, increase the income of farmers and herdsmen, and the accumulation of the country. It is completely in line with the overall interests, and is also a fundamental way to promote a great leap forward in dairy product production.

Third, cultivate the technical force of the dairy products industry. The existing technical force of dairy factories is quite weak. According to the statistics in 1957, there were only 95 technical personnel in more than 70 dairy factories across the country, accounting for 3 percent of the total number of employees. The vast majority of them were promoted from other industrial departments or cadres and workers, and their technical level is generally low. In order to solve the shortage of technical force and meet future needs, the Ministry of Food Industry began to train a group of specialized technical cadres in Nanjing in 1957, and plans to set up dairy specialties in secondary food technology cadre schools in Tianjin and Nanjing in the future to train a group of dairy secondary technical personnel, but a certain number of teachers are needed. In order to properly solve the technical force of the dairy products industry to meet the needs of the great leap forward in the dairy products industry, it is recommended that the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Agriculture set up a dairy processing major department at Harbin Agricultural College.

(2) Regarding the Development of Milk Substitutes

Actively develop milk substitutes and other children's foods, enrich the content of infant food, and meet the needs of infants of various ages.

In terms of infant food, in addition to milk powder among the above-mentioned dairy products, there are also various milk substitutes (referring to blended milk substitute powder and milk substitute cake) with grain as the main raw material. In recent years, due to the long-term insufficient supply of milk powder and its high price, the milk substitute industry has also developed greatly. In 1952, the total output of milk substitutes produced by the industrial sector was approximately 420 tons, and in 1957 it reached more than 7,600 tons, an increase of approximately 17 times compared with 1952. It can be seen that milk substitutes have played a great role in meeting the needs of infants.

At present, there are still some problems in the milk substitute industry, such as low quality, tight raw material supply, and high prices. Among them, quality and raw materials are the main problems that need to be solved urgently.

The quality of milk substitutes depends on whether the milk substitute formula and the supply of other nutrients are suitable for the growth and development needs of infants. Most of the existing milk substitute formulas in China are mainly rice flour and wheat flour, with a small amount of sugar and calcium and phosphorus substances added, or 3 to 5 percent milk powder and approximately 5 percent egg yolk powder added. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has used these milk substitutes to feed animals in experiments, proving that some of these milk substitutes only supply a large amount of starch and cannot promote appropriate growth and development. Some, although they add some nutrients, are still far behind the nutritional needs of infants. The quality of these milk substitutes urgently needs to be improved. Only the "5410" milk substitute cake formula formulated by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, with soybean flour as the main ingredient, containing soybean flour, rice flour, riboflavin, sucrose, soybean oil, salt, and bone meal, etc., can catch up with breast milk and milk powder in terms of promoting infant growth. In order to improve and improve the quality of milk substitutes, the Ministry of Food Industry has focused on promoting this formula in cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Harbin, and Changchun in 1957, and will fully promote it this year.

Although the "5410" formula is currently a better formula among milk substitutes and should be promoted, China is vast and rich in resources, and there are great differences in raw material conditions and processing technology between regions. It is difficult to meet the different requirements of various parts of the country based on only one standard formula. In order to improve the chaotic situation of milk substitute formulas, it is recommended that health research departments and industrial departments in various places conduct research and experiments to develop more nutritionally superior formulas. At the same time, strictly implement the health inspection system in the milk substitute industry, and effectively improve product packaging, so as to achieve the production of a variety of affordable and high-quality milk substitutes to supply the urgent needs of society.

The tight supply of raw materials for milk substitutes is the most prominent problem at present. Due to the insufficient supply of raw materials such as soybeans, rice, egg yolk powder, riboflavin, and bone meal, the production potential of the milk substitute industry cannot be fully utilized and cannot meet the needs of the market. According to the information reflected by various places at the milk substitute conference held by the Ministry of Food Industry this time, for example, a vast area of ​​Hunan Province lacks dairy products and milk substitutes, but due to the relationship of grain supply, the milk substitutes produced in Changsha City can only meet the needs of Changsha City. The annual output of milk substitute powder in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, can only supply one quarter of sales. Due to the grain relationship, the output of milk substitutes from Jilin, Changchun, and Huakang Food Industry Society this year has been reduced by 20 percent compared with 1957. The planned total output of the country in 1958 has also declined compared with 1957. The Ministry of Food Industry has proposed solutions for raw materials such as egg yolk powder, riboflavin, and bone meal. Regarding the grain issue, it is hoped that the grain departments in various places will give the necessary support to ensure supply.

In addition, many countries have made great progress in recent years in the processing of fruit puree, vegetable puree, liver puree, fruit juice, and vegetable juice in terms of infant and children's food, while China is still a blank slate, which needs our active development. The above-mentioned milk substitutes are used to solve the staple food of infants who lack breast milk or dairy products. In addition, infants also need supplementary foods such as vegetable puree. This is not only because they contain quite rich nutrients, which are suitable for the needs of infant and young children's body development, but also because those unutilized fruits and vegetables, especially in mountainous areas, can be utilized and can be made into various infant foods. In this way, resources can be fully utilized, and infant food can be diversified, thereby enriching and enriching the content of infant food to meet the growth and development needs of infants of various ages.

Please correct the above opinions.

    大力发展乳制品工业解决婴儿食品问题
    罗叔章　诸福棠　张晓梅　易湘苏　沈其震　夏之栩代表的联合发言
    我们衷心的拥护李先念副总理，薄一波副总理，彭真副委员长和吴玉章主任的四个报告。现在我们想就发展我国的乳制品工业与解决婴儿食品方面的问题发表一些意见。
    第一个五年计划期间乳制品的年产量增长到17.4倍，代乳品的年产量增长了16.9倍。但是由于社会需要的急骤增长，近年来乳制品和代乳品还是供不应求。
    几年以来，随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，人民生活的不断改善、提高，和城市妇女的就业与大批农村妇女参加劳动生产，许多婴儿需要人工喂养或混合喂养，因此大大的提高了对于乳制品、乳粉及各种代乳品的需要量，乳制品（包括乳粉）工业和代乳品工业亦相应的得到了很大的发展。一九五二年我国乳制品产量为六百二十四吨（内乳粉四百六十三吨），一九五七年增长到一万零八百六十三吨（内乳粉四千五百二十吨），为一九五二年的十七点四倍（其中乳粉增长了八点七倍），一九五二年全部代乳品产量（包括代乳粉和代乳糕）为四百二十六吨，一九五七年为七千六百一十六吨，比一九五二年增长了十六点九倍。
    我国乳制品和代乳品工业虽然有了很快的发展，但其发展速度远不能与急骤增长的社会需要，特别是婴儿食品的需要相适应，这种情况自一九五六年下半年起表现最为突出，在全国普遍发生了乳粉严重脱销的情况，社会上反映很大，很多母亲写信、打电话给报社、人民委员会及生产销售部门，有的还附上小孩的照片，更有不少的母亲由于买不到乳粉，就把小孩放在商店和供应站的柜台上，不肯抱走，要求供应乳粉。这种供应紧张的情况至今还不能得到根本解决。例如一九五七年第四季度，商业部门对于乳粉的要货数为一千三百八十三吨，工业部门仅能满足四百九十吨，最后从丹麦进口了一部分，补充市场供应。
    大家都知道乳品工业产量中的乳粉、炼乳（不加糖的淡乳）不仅是喂养婴儿时用以代替人乳的理想食品，而且是病员及广大成人最优良的食品，冷饮糕点工业亦需要大批乳粉。乳糖是医药工业制造青霉素、氯霉素的重要培养剂，奶油、胳胶可供国内人民、国内工业及出口的大批需要，一九五七年全部乳制品产量一万零八百六十三吨中，乳粉为四千五百二十吨，炼乳为四千七百六十九吨，奶油八百三十六吨，乳糖三百三十六吨，胳胶为四百零二吨，这些产品数量近年来都不能满足国内外市场的需要。
    最近食品工业部，根据有关部门的资料，对婴儿所需乳粉、代乳品方面及其他需要方面，算了一笔账，使我们知道了目前特别是今后社会需要量是会日益增长的。按全国婴儿出生率大约为百分之三点二，据此，一周岁以下的婴儿一个年度内则为一千九百一十四万人。根据卫生部门对北京、上海、成都几个大都市的调查，在一岁以下的婴儿中约有百分之六十六食用母乳，百分之五人工喂养（完全不用母乳），百分之二十九混合喂养（母乳不足），在农村婴儿中按估算百分之三需要人工喂养，百分之五混合喂养。因此，不包括周岁以上幼儿、病员与冷饮糕点食品工业的需要，城市每年即需乳粉约一万二千吨（按全部用量乳粉占百分之四十八计算）、代乳品约一万二千六百吨（按全部用量代乳品占百分之五十二计算），农村每年即需乳粉一万零一百吨（按全部用量百分之三十计算）、代乳品二万二千三百吨
  （按全部用量百分之七十计算）。上述婴儿食用的数量除京、沪、津等少数大城市部分可以鲜奶供应，大量的还是需要生产乳粉、代乳品来解决，今后这一要求将更迫切。除一般婴儿食用外，估计产院出生的婴儿及所有的病员现在每年约需乳粉一千五百吨，冷饮糕点需要乳粉三千六百吨，一九五八年产奶油约一千四百吨，实际尚供不应求。乳糖需二千吨，胳胶需一千二百吨。若能出口这些产品都是有很大销路的。根据以上的推算，仅国内社会需要量一年内共为乳粉二万七千二百吨，代乳品三万四千九百吨，乳糖二千吨，奶油一千四百吨，胳胶一千二百吨。如果能够大量提高生产，可以积极组织出口，换取外汇，支援国家工农业建设，因此大跃进的发展乳制品、代乳品工业是应该引起各方面充分重视的。
    以下就发展乳制品和代乳品问题提出一些意见。
    （一）关于发展乳制品的问题
    全国各地都有发展乳牛乳羊畜牧业的有利条件；至今还有许多分散的乳源没有利用。
    在我国的北方与西北有大片的草原、广大的牧区，有大批的黄牛、牦牛和犏牛；南方有长年不枯的青草，饲养着许多水牛和黄牛，各地乳牛生产的鲜奶，除很少地区设有乳品厂组织工业加工外，绝大部分地区特别是乳源分散地区的奶品加工业还是空白点。如内蒙古地区估计全年可产鲜奶二十万吨，目前工业加工只利用二万六千吨，利用率仅百分之十三；甘肃省天祝藏族自治县水丰乡在半径十公里以内，就有乳牛七千多头，目前亦未组织加工；新疆全区约有乳牛六十七万头，在三个国营牧区就有乳牛一万四千六百八十六头，新疆精河县距城八公里的一个地方国营牧场，亦有乳牛四千零八十一头，这些乳牛所产的鲜奶除提取少量奶油外，大部尚未利用，新疆全区目前尚无一个乳品加工厂；又如山西沁源县现有乳牛五千二百二十七头，其中改良种母牛就有一千零八十头，目前只作为耕地或出卖，并未利用挤奶。此外，在南方云南邓川县城附近，每天可收购鲜奶五至七吨，福建漳州市附近每月可收鲜奶八吨，目前都未全部利用。浙江温州一带，以水牛耕乳兼用，利用水牛奶加工制成乳制品已有长期的经验，并作出了优良的成绩。除牛奶外我国尚有大批羊奶亦未被利用。据有关部门最近的调查，云南省约有山羊五百万头，牛四百四十万头，该省农民把牛、羊奶制成乳扇销售。由此可以看出，在全国各地都有发展乳牛和乳羊的有利条件，而目前的情况却是很多分散的奶源未被利用，或者被浪费了，因此，我们认为：
    乳制品工业也应该来一个大跃进，大、中、小乳品加工企业密切结合，把分散的乳源充分利用起来。
    第一，应该在乳制品工业中来一个生产大跃进，争取在一两年内将现有的分散乳源充分利用起来，普遍建立乳品加工厂和加工站，消灭空白点。
    最近食品工业部召开的全国乳制品代乳品技术经验交流会议，大家认为消灭空白点可采用下面几种方法：
    （1）在乳源分散交通不便的地区建立平锅设备的小型乳品厂，根据黑龙江省一九五七年大量发展平锅加工厂的经验，建设一个日夜两班处理一吨到两吨鲜奶的平锅加工厂，只要投资一万五千元，两、三个月即可投入生产。黑龙江省一九五七年投资仅二十万元建立了四十二处加工厂（平锅一百三十多口），当年即生产乳制品三百吨左右，投资在半年内就收回了。采用平锅生产可以培养乳源，提高产奶量，为将来新建大、中型先进设备的工厂创造条件，如黑龙江省北安县一九五五年原有乳牛六百多头，由于奶卖不掉减到三百头，一九五七年建设八口平锅组织加工后，一年内即增加乳牛到六百头。肇源县设加工厂前，一头牛售价为三十元，一九五七年建厂后提高到一百元。另外，增加农民收入，利用农业社的劳动力，密切工农关系等方面的好处很多。平锅生产的奶粉，在质量方面能达到糕点、冻饮等工业用的标准，甚至还可以达到婴儿食用标准。
    （2）大中小乳品加工企业密切配合。除建立平锅设备以外，在大厂的外围，建立收奶站，建立半成品加工站，对扩大乳源，保证产量质量，缩短大厂的停工季节也是非常重要的。
    建议各级领导机关，对发展乳制品充分利用奶源的问题，在投资、设备、干部、基建方面给以大力的支持，以争取早日将这批营养丰富的优良食品充分利用起来，为不断的提高人民生活福利，给以充分的供应，为国家创造更多的财富，积累更多的资金。
    大力发展乳牛畜牧业，改良乳牛品种，提高乳牛单位产奶量。
    第二，发展乳牛畜牧业。发展乳品工业必须积极发展乳牛，改良乳牛品种，提高乳牛的单位产奶量，延长泌乳期，并相应地加强乳牛的饲养管理，解决乳牛的饲料、牛舍以及防疫等，这些工作单靠工业部门是不能完成的，必须请各地有关部门予以大力支持，加强对乳牛事业的领导，密切工、农、牧业及卫生部门之间的配合协作，通过共同努力，才能得到解决。
    （1）加强饲养管理方面。根据华北农业科学研究所的资料，北满牛在滨州沿线饲养一年仅产奶二千多公斤，而在北京双桥农场饲养的同种乳牛，一个产奶期平均产奶达四千七百公斤，其主要原因是由于北京对北满牛饲料供应较多和建有牛舍。但目前各地对解决乳牛饲料建筑牛舍等等一般重视不够，如内蒙古有些地区乳牛就得不到精饲料，浙江温州一带，有时亦不给乳牛精饲料。在牛舍方面，内蒙古、黑龙江很多乳牛在零下四十度的冰天雪地里过冬，很少有牛舍设备，这些乳牛冬季产奶量大减，甚至停奶。这些问题如不妥善解决，不但影响乳牛产奶量的提高和工厂生产的正常化，同时还损害乳牛体质。此外，乳牛病疫方面，问题也很严重，很多地区的牛患肺结核、流产病，我们要求当地主管部门，对于乳牛的饲料、牛舍及防疫问题等进行统筹安排。
    （2）在各大城市工矿区应利用各种食品工业废料，如豆饼、麸皮、果皮、蔬菜等饲养乳牛，供给市民用奶。如北京市饲养的乳牛现有七千八百头，比一九五二年增加了二倍多。上海市由一九五六年的八千四百头发展到一万零五百头，对满足人民需要发挥了很大的作用。但城市饲养乳牛应严格执行消毒设备，保证鲜奶卫生，及建立为旺季奶多时的必要加工设备，以避免浪费。
    （3）改良乳牛品种。目前我国乳制品工业所用的鲜奶，主要依靠三种乳牛供应：在黑龙江、内蒙古一带，主要为三合牛和改良种乳牛，一个产奶期产奶量一般为二千至三千公斤；浙江、广东、福建等地主要为水牛，一个产奶期一般产奶量为五百至六百公斤；在青海、甘肃等地主要是牧区黄牛、牦牛和犏牛，一个产奶期产量约为二百五十至四百公斤。三类牛产奶量悬殊很大，可以看出改良乳牛品种对于发展乳品工业来讲，是一项根本性的重要措施。山西省沁源县黄牛改种后的经验证明，改种后的牛不但产奶多，而且耕地力气也大了，群众称改种牛为“荷兰牛（实际指改种牛）真可爱，长得粗，发育快，力气大，能产奶，价值高，农家宝。”根据以上经验证明，我国对现有牛种加以改良，不但是必要的，而且也是可能的。这样做，不仅以促进乳品工业的发展，同时也可以刺激畜牧业与农业的发展，增加农、牧民的收入与国家的积累，是完全符合整体利益的，也是促进乳制品生产大跃进的根本办法。
    第三，培养乳制品工业的技术力量。乳品厂现有技术力量是相当薄弱的，根据一九五七年的统计，在全国七十多个乳品厂中，仅有技术人员九十五名，占职工总数的百分之三，其中绝大多数是由其他工业部门或干部、工人中提拔的，技术水平一般较低，为了解决技术力量的不足及今后的需要，一九五七年食品工业部在南京开始培训一部分专业技术干部，并准备今后在天津、南京中等食品技术干部学校中设立乳品专业，培养一批乳品中等技术人员，但需要一定数量的师资。为了妥善解决乳制品工业的技术力量，以适应乳制品工业大跃进的需要，建议高等教育部和农业部，在哈尔滨农学院开设一个乳品加工的专业系。
    （二）关于发展代乳品的问题
    积极发展代乳品和其他儿童食品，丰富婴儿食品的内容，满足各种不同年龄婴儿的需要。
    在婴儿食品方面除上述乳制品中的乳粉以外，还有以粮食为主要原料的各种代乳品（指配合的代乳粉和代乳糕）。几年来由于乳粉的长期供应不足，加之价格较高，代乳品工业也得到了很大的发展。一九五二年代乳品总产量由工业部门生产的约为四百二十余吨，一九五七年达到七千六百余吨，比一九五二年增产约十七倍。由此可见，代乳品在满足婴儿需要方面，是起了很大的作用。
    目前在代乳品工业中还存在一些问题，如质量低，原料供应紧张，价格较高等等，其中质量和原料是当前急待解决的主要问题。
    代乳品质量的优劣，决定于代乳品之配方及其他各种营养素供给是否适合婴儿生长发育的需要，国内现有之代乳品配方，大多数是以大米粉、面粉为主，加入少量糖及钙、磷物质，或再加入了百分之三至五的牛乳粉，百分之五左右的蛋黄粉。中国医学科学院曾用这类代乳品喂养动物试验，证明这些代乳品有的只供应大量淀粉质，不能促进适当的生长发育，有的虽然加了一些营养成分，仍远远赶不上婴儿的营养需要，这些代乳品的质量都迫切需要改进。唯中国医学科学院拟订的以大豆粉为主要成分的“5410号”代乳糕配方，内含大豆粉、大米粉、核黄素、蔗糖、豆油、食盐和骨粉等，在促进婴儿生长的效果上，可以赶上母乳和乳粉。食品工业部为了改进和提高代乳品质量，一九五七年已重点在上海、北京、天津、南京、武汉、广州、西安、哈尔滨、长春等城市推广这一配方，今年将作全面推广。
      “5410”配方虽然在目前是代乳品中较好的一种配方，应当加以推广。但我国地大物博，各地区间原料条件和加工技术的差别很大，仅根据一个标准配方，尚难满足全国各地不同的要求，为了改善代乳品配方的混乱情况，建议卫生研究部门及各地工业部门，加以研究试验，制订出更多的营养优良的配方，同时在代乳品工业中严格贯彻卫生检验制度，切实改进产品包装，达到生产多种多样价廉物美的代乳品，以供应社会的迫切需要。
    代乳品原料供应紧张是当前一个最突出的问题。由于大豆、大米、蛋黄粉、核黄素、骨粉等原料得不到充分供应，以致代乳品工业的生产潜力得不到充分发挥，不能满足市场的需要。根据这次食品工业部召开的代乳品会议，各地反映的情况，例如湖南省广大地区皆缺乏乳制品和代乳品，但由于粮食供应的关系，长沙市生产的代乳品只能供应长沙市的需要。江西省南昌市代乳粉全年的产量只能供应一个季度的销售，吉林、长春、华康食品工业社代乳品产量，由于粮食关系，今年的产量比一九五七年压缩了百分之二十。一九五八年全国计划总产量较一九五七年亦有下降。关于蛋黄粉、核黄素、骨粉等原料，食品工业部已提出了解决的办法。关于粮食问题，希望各地粮食部门给予必要的支持保证供应。
    此外，许多国家对于婴儿和儿童食品方面的果泥、菜泥、肝泥、果汁、菜汁等加工业，近年来有了很大的进展，而我国还是一个空白点，有待我们积极发展。上述的代乳品是用来解决缺乏母乳或乳制品的婴儿的主食。此外，婴儿还需要菜泥等补助食品，这不仅是它们含有相当丰富的营养素，适合婴幼儿身体发育的需要，而且可以使那些尚未利用的特别是山区的果蔬等能加以利用，可用来制成各种婴儿食品，如此既充分利用了资源，又能使婴儿食品多样化，从而充实和丰富婴儿食品的内容，来满足各种不同年龄婴儿生长发育的需要。
    以上意见请代表们指正。
