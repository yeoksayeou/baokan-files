Editor's Note: The Xusheng Agricultural Cooperative of Baoshan Township, Suihua County, has always been classified as a first-class cooperative, but it fails to meet the grain purchase quota every year, has many problems, and is rife with unhealthy tendencies. After a thorough rectification with the help of a joint work team, it was discovered that the root cause of the cooperative's problems was the seriously impure composition of its leading cadres. This issue deserves our attention and vigilance. In the rural rectification and cooperative consolidation work, we must pay careful attention to discovering third-class cooperatives like the Xusheng Cooperative, which are concealed under the guise of first-class cooperatives but are actually manipulated by landlords and rich peasants.

Approximately 10% to 15% of the original cooperatives nationwide were third-class cooperatives. There are many reasons for the existence of third-class cooperatives. In this rectification and cooperative consolidation movement, all regions have paid attention to thoroughly resolving the problems of third-class cooperatives and backward teams in first and second-class cooperatives. It is hoped that all regions will select some typical cases of third-class cooperatives and their rectification experiences to be summarized and promoted in a timely manner.

The Xusheng Agricultural Cooperative of Baoshan Township, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, was established in the winter of 1955. It has a total of 236 households, 1,381 people, and 898 hectares of land. It is one of the seven cooperatives in Baoshan Township (a model township of Suihua County) with the best land and the highest yield. It has received two production model awards and has always been classified as a first-class cooperative. However, this cooperative fails to meet the grain purchase quota every year. Unhealthy tendencies such as drinking, gambling, theft, and chaotic relationships between men and women are rampant. Cooperative cadres resist their superiors, and it is difficult for the work personnel sent by the higher authorities to carry out their work. None of the township cadres want to be assigned to lead the work of this cooperative. The county and township leaders knew about the problems in this cooperative long ago, but the cadres sent down to rectify the Party and consolidate the cooperative only made a brief visit of ten days or half a month each year, and never went deep into the masses to find out the nature of the problems, so the problems were never thoroughly resolved.

In November 1957, our joint work team, composed of cadres from the Central Rural Work Department, Suihua County, and Baoshan Township, conducted a class investigation, made individual connections, and fully mobilized the masses to carry out a relatively thorough rectification work. After two and a half months, the problems were exposed. It turned out that this first-class cooperative in the model township was actually a third-class cooperative manipulated by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. The masses called it "Little Taiwan." The problem was very serious. Now, the materials revealed by the masses and the main aspects of our work are described below:

    Thorough Land Reform Incomplete, Organization Seriously Impure

The masses said: The problems in our cooperative are like "ice three feet thick, not a day's cold." Originally, the predecessor of the Xusheng Agricultural Cooperative—the Seventh Village of Baoshan Township—was a village where land reform was not thorough. Of the 15 landlord households in the village, 11 were wrongly classified as rich peasants, and one was missed and classified as a middle peasant. Of the four rich peasant households, one was missed and classified as a middle peasant. This household occupied 114 hectares of land, had been a foreman, and none of the nine family members participated in labor. In addition, Sun Jingquan, a large landlord who relied entirely on exploitation for a living, owned 33 hectares of land himself, rented 76 hectares of land, had 17 horses, three carts, and hired five long-term laborers and a large number of short-term laborers; and Zhao Wenjiang, a rich peasant with only three people participating in labor, were both classified as middle peasants. They have been mixing in with the basic masses to stir up trouble and do evil. Because land reform was not thorough, counter-revolutionary elements took the opportunity to infiltrate. The veterinarian Xu Yinsheng hid two counter-revolutionary elements from 1949 for four years. In 1952, one was arrested and suppressed, and the other was released by Xu Yinsheng. Xu himself also had counter-revolutionary activities. The counter-revolutionary element Cheng Yongxin moved to this village from Suihua City in the winter of 1949, colluded with landlords and rich peasants, and won over backward masses to sabotage various political movements.

The main village and cooperative cadres are seriously impure. Chen Guofa, the chairman of the peasant association during the land reform, smoked opium before liberation and had an affair with a landlord's wife. He engaged in sham struggles during the land reform, which led to incomplete land reform. After the land reform, he has been serving as the main cadre of the village and cooperative, often eating and drinking in the homes of landlords and rich peasants. He has always fled from the major tasks assigned to him by the Party. He has evaded military service and war three times, and pretends to be sick every year when purchasing grain to avoid doing work. His work style is corrupt and degenerate. The masses revealed that he had improper relationships with twelve women. Another bad cadre, Wang Yuntao, smoked opium during the puppet Manchukuo period and served as a labor squad leader. He hid things for landlords during land reform. After land reform, he served as the village chief and the director of the primary cooperative. In 1956, he was promoted to the production committee member of the township people's committee and was assigned to lead the work of the Xusheng Cooperative. During his tenure as village chief and director of the primary cooperative, he embezzled more than 300 yuan. Like Chen Guofa, he took the landlord and rich peasant line and often ate and drank extravagantly. Both of them had close relationships with counter-revolutionary elements. The counter-revolutionary element Cheng Yongxin became Chen Guofa's "chief strategist," often offering him advice, telling him to take the landlord line, using two-faced tactics in front of his superiors, and winning over a group of backward masses to support him in order to maintain his dominant position. "Like seeks like," Chen Guofa and Wang Yuntao seized power, making the organization of the Xusheng Cooperative seriously impure. Among the seven Party branch committee members, Chen Guofa, the branch committee member and cooperative director, was a landlord and rich peasant lackey. Yang Fengyi, the branch committee member and deputy director, was a degenerate element. Wu Hongbin, the branch secretary, had serious capitalist ideas and colluded with Chen and Yang. One of the two organization committee members was a bad element who had infiltrated the Party, and the other came from a bankrupt landlord family. One of the two propaganda committee members came from a small merchant family. Among the 11 management committee members, only the livestock committee member (poor peasant) and the cashier (newly-risen middle peasant) were relatively pure. Among the 20 production team leaders, eight were landlords and rich peasants, and three were old upper-middle peasants. Among the 30 cart owners, 12 were landlords and rich peasants, and five were old upper-middle peasants. Among the 14 accountants and work recorders of the production teams, six were landlords and rich peasants, and three were old upper-middle peasants. The flour mill manager was a missed rich peasant. The cart team leader was a missed landlord. Of the 19 landlord and rich peasant households in the entire cooperative (later divided into 50 households after land reform), 28 people held important positions. Of the 26 old upper-middle peasant households, 12 people held important positions.

A group of bad cadres headed by Chen Guofa openly spread fallacies, saying, "Landlords and rich peasants are honest and capable. Without them, the cooperative cannot be run well." "Party members are all backward. Communist Youth League members are just spouting Marxism-Leninism but not doing practical work. Demobilized soldiers are troublemakers, and poor households are lazybones." They praised the landlords and rich peasants to the skies and trampled on good Party members and activists. The masses called the Xusheng Cooperative "the Chen family's world manipulated by landlords and rich peasants."

    Which Road Was the Xusheng Cooperative Taking?

The masses said very clearly: "The cadres of our cooperative are working for the landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy people. They are reversing the Party's class line." "The first turnaround was not successful (referring to the incomplete land reform), and the second time we were turned into the mud (referring to the continued poverty and oppression after collectivization)." Originally, the Seventh Village of Baoshan Township was a good place, a famous "treasure land" in western Suihua County. The land quality was particularly good, and the yield increased year by year after land reform. In particular, after running advanced cooperatives for two years, the yield reached 3,800 catties per hectare, double that of 1949. It was precisely because of this that people were confused, classified it as a first-class cooperative, and gave it a production model award. However, whoever is in power takes what road. Various forms of disguised exploitation appeared in the Xusheng Cooperative, and it suffered many shocking destructions. The lives of landlords, rich peasants, and upper-middle peasants were getting better and better, while many poor and lower-middle peasants remained poor. Landlords and rich peasants ran rampant, the masses swallowed their anger, the productive enthusiasm of the masses was frustrated, and production suffered major damage. The masses said, "With this good place, if there were good people leading, each hectare would yield at least 4,500 catties of grain, possibly reaching 5,000 catties. Our lives wouldn't be like this!"

Landlords, rich peasants, and a small number of upper-middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas used their positions as directors, production team leaders, and group leaders to control the real power of directing production. They first assigned the good jobs with more work points to their own people, and asked the poor and lower-middle peasants to do the heavy jobs with fewer work points. Whoever disagreed would be labeled as "troublemakers" or "lazybones." The landlord Zhang Yunqiao did three jobs in a year (road repair, fetching water for the flour mill, and feeding pigs), earning 180 workdays. The landlord Wang Jingyang watched the sesame field with his child in his arms, earning six points a day. The poor peasant Qu Zhanshan worked all year round without rest, earning only 190 workdays. He said, "Our roots of poverty have not been dug out. The rich are still popular!" This intangible exploitation is difficult to calculate in numbers. Landlords, rich peasants, upper-middle peasants, and their children served as accountants and work recorders, using pens and abacuses to carry out exploitation in various ways. Wang Dianfeng, a rich peasant who served as a team accountant for two years, embezzled 983 work points and 204 yuan in cash. He deducted work points from cooperative members and recorded them in the accounts of landlords and rich peasants. When registering the amount of fertilizer accumulated by cooperative members, he reported less for landlords and rich peasants and calculated more work points, and reported more for poor and lower-middle peasants and calculated fewer work points. The flour mill was controlled by four landlords. When they purchased potatoes, they lifted the scales and raised the grade for landlords and rich peasants, and pressed the scales and lowered the grade for poor and lower-middle peasants. Good vermicelli were given to landlords and rich peasants, and moldy vermicelli were given to poor and lower-middle peasants.

The vicious sabotage by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements caused shocking losses to the agricultural cooperative. Their main methods were to severely injure draught animals and waste crops and grain in large quantities. They did not feed or water draught horses, overloaded them, made them run fast, and beat them severely. They deliberately beat pregnant horses and hit horses' eyes. In the two years of advanced cooperation, they killed eight horses, crippled four horses, blinded four horses, and aborted three horses, causing the agricultural cooperative to lose more than 9,010 yuan. The veterinarian Xu Yinsheng killed 13 horses of the agricultural cooperative. The landlord Sun Jingquan, as the cart team leader, made 15 good horses emaciated. The landlord Zhang Yunqiao fed pigs, but did not sift or cook the feed thoroughly, killing six pigs and aborting two litters of piglets, losing 800 yuan. When sowing, they deliberately planted fewer seeds and planted the seeds next to the ridges, causing missing seedlings. When weeding, they cut down a large number of seedlings. When cultivating the land, they pressed down a large number of seedlings. When harvesting crops, they cut quickly and coarsely, wasting a large amount of grain. When hauling crops, they dropped grain along the way. When threshing, they deliberately threshed unclearly. According to incomplete statistics, this loss amounted to 7,230 yuan. In addition, they damaged farm implements and public property, causing the agricultural cooperative to lose a total of more than 25,000 yuan, equivalent to 20% of the total output value in 1957.

The lives of landlords, rich peasants, and some upper-middle peasants in the Xusheng Cooperative were getting better and better, but most poor and lower-middle peasants rose very slowly. At present, there are still 23 households living in extreme poverty, and the conditions of clothing, food, and housing are vastly different. In the past two years, 121 new houses have been built in the entire cooperative, of which 19 landlord and rich peasant households occupied 53, averaging nearly three rooms per household. Twenty-six old upper-middle peasant households occupied 41 rooms, averaging one and a half rooms per household. One hundred and forty-eight poor and new middle peasant households occupied only 27 rooms. Landlords, rich peasants, and upper-middle peasants lived in new houses with green oil doors, glass windows, lime tops, and bright and spacious rooms, while some poor and lower-middle peasants still lived in low, narrow, and dark broken houses. The adults and children of landlords and rich peasant households all wore new clothes. The old men wore fur coats, and the young people wore leather shoes. However, some poor peasants wore torn clothes with leaking cotton, and still wore single hats in winter. The Qiao De family of six could not afford cotton clothes. The adults could not go out to work, and the children had to warm themselves around the fire. Every landlord household had old grain, with a total of more than 20,000 catties of old grain, feeding the pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks so fat that they even sold grain at high prices. The poor peasant Qu Zhonghou had no grain to eat, and his family of five cried bitterly. In such a clear comparison, the landlords proudly said to the poor peasants, "You've turned over once, but you're still poor!"

    Determined to Rectify, Boldly Rectify, Thoroughly Rectify

Baoshan Township is a key township of the county and district Party committees, and must take the lead in realizing the targets required by the "National Agricultural Development Program" in 1958, with a yield of 6,000 catties per hectare. The leaders of the county, district, and township were afraid that the Xusheng Cooperative would become a stumbling block in the progress of the entire township, and were determined to change the face of the Xusheng Cooperative. The rectification work of the Xusheng Cooperative was mainly carried out by relying on the three magic weapons that the Party often taught us: first, investigation and research, and class analysis; second, resolutely implement the Party's class line of relying on poor and hired peasants in the countryside; and third, adopt the working method of the mass line of individual connections. As soon as the work team arrived at the Xusheng Cooperative, they spent half a month conducting a class investigation, visiting poor and lower-middle peasants one by one. Starting from solving the urgent problems that the masses needed to solve, they contacted the masses and discovered activists. Some of the masses said generously: "No cadres have come to my house for many years. Comrades from Beijing come to see us, which shows that Chairman Mao has not forgotten us poor people!" We used the hook-up method among activists among the poor and lower-middle peasants to gradually organize the masses and explain the Party's class line to them. Experience has proved that once the Party's policy meets with the masses, it immediately becomes a great material force. The masses used the Party's class line as a mirror to compare the situation in the cooperative, and suddenly realized, and their emotions were agitated. A large number of materials were revealed. In just five days, we clarified the nature of the problem.

Then, we launched a rectification of the Party while mobilizing the masses, forming a situation of internal and external attack. At the beginning, the focus of the masses was concentrated on the cooperative director Chen Guofa and the deputy director Yang Fengyi. After airing views and reasoning, their true faces were revealed. According to the opinions of the masses, the county Party committee immediately announced the dismissal and repentance of Chen Guofa and Yang Fengyi. The masses were overjoyed and their morale was boosted. Immediately following, the focus of the struggle turned to the landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements. We also arrested five reactionary landlords and two counter-revolutionary elements in accordance with the law, and calculated the accounts of exploitation and sabotage for the landlords and rich peasants according to the demands of the masses. When distributing grain, we deducted more than 26,000 catties of grain from the landlords and rich peasants and distributed it to the cooperative members. When finalizing the accounts and distributing profits, we deducted more than 20,000 yuan from the losses caused by the sabotage of the landlords and rich peasants (part of it was deducted in cash, and part of it was recorded in the accounts), which was retained as the public accumulation of the agricultural cooperative. The political treatment of landlord and rich peasant elements was based on their consistent performance, and they were divided into three categories: cooperative members, probationary cooperative members, and controlled production. They were treated differently, and their positions in the cooperative were revoked. A new batch of activists from among the poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants were re-elected to fill them. The political advantages of the masses have been established. The Party branch committee and the cooperative's management committee were also rectified and re-elected, purifying the leading body and establishing a leading core. At the same time, in order to ensure the victory and consolidate the socialist front, the county Party committee decided to send the deputy secretary of the township Party committee and the propaganda committee member to the Xusheng Cooperative to serve as the branch secretary and cooperative director. In this way, the masses relied on the leadership of the Party and their own strength to liberate this "Little Taiwan" that had been hidden for more than ten years. The masses said, "We have turned over again, and this time we have truly seen the clear sky."

The high tide of rectification has brought about a high tide of production, and the socialist enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedentedly overflowing. The Xusheng Cooperative overfulfilled the 1957 grain purchase task by 2.25 million catties, 450,000 catties more than last year, becoming the cooperative with the most grain delivered per hectare in the entire township. After delivering grain, they immediately delivered manure. In just over a month, manure has been piled on 300 hectares of land, accounting for one-third of the cultivated area. It is estimated that all cultivated land can be filled with manure before the Spring Festival, reaching 60,000 to 90,000 catties per hectare, which is unprecedented. From then on, the Xusheng Cooperative embarked on the broad road of socialism.

    掩盖在一类社称号下的三类社
    旭升社经过整改走上了社会主义大道
    中央农村工作部、中共黑龙江绥化县委联合工作组
    编者按　绥化县宝山乡旭升农业社一向被划为一类社，却年年完不成购粮任务，问题很多，邪风很盛。经过联合工作组帮助彻底整顿，发现该社产生问题的根本原因是领导干部的成份严重不纯。这个问题值得我们注意和警惕。在农村整风、整社工作中，要认真地注意发现像旭升社那样掩盖在一类社的称号下，实际被地主、富农操纵的三类社。
    全国原有的三类社大约占总社数的10％至15％左右。三类社存在的原因很多。各地在此次整风、整社运动中，已经注意彻底解决三类社和一、二类社中落后队的问题。希望各地选一些典型的三类社的情况和整顿经验及时加以总结和推广。
    黑龙江省绥化县宝山乡旭升农业社建立于1955年冬季，共二百三十六户，一千三百八十一口人，土地八百九十八公顷，是宝山乡（绥化县的模范乡）七个社里面土地最好、产量最高的一个社，曾得过两次生产模范奖励，一向被划为一类社。但是，这个社年年完不成购粮任务，酗酒、赌博、偷盗、男女关系混乱等邪风很盛，社干部抗上，上面派去的工作人员很难进行工作，乡里干部谁也不愿意被分工领导这个社的工作。县、乡领导上早知道这个社有问题，可是每年派下去整党整社的干部，总是十天半月一走一过，始终没有深入到群众中去弄清问题的性质，也就没有把问题彻底解决。
    1957年11月，我们和绥化县、宝山乡干部组成的联合工作组经过阶级调查，个别串连，充分发动群众进行比较彻底的整顿工作，历时两个半月，问题被揭穿了。原来这个模范乡里的一类社，却是一个被地、富、反革命分子所操纵的三类社，群众叫它是“小台湾”。问题十分严重。现在把群众所揭发的材料和我们工作的主要情况分述如下：
    土改不彻底  组织严重不纯
    群众说：我们的社问题好比“冰冻三尺，不是一日之寒”。原来旭升农业社的前身——宝山乡第七村，是一个土地改革不彻底的村子。全村十五户地主有十一户错划为富农，一户漏划为中农。四户富农有一户漏划为中农。此户占有一百一十四公顷土地，当过把头，全家九口人不参加劳动。此外，全靠剥削为生的大地主孙景全，自己有三十三公顷土地，佃种七十六公顷土地，有十七匹马，三辆车，雇五个长工，大批短工；以及自己只有三个人参加劳动的大富农赵文江，都被划为中农。他俩一直混在基本群众里头混水摸鱼为非作歹。由于土改不彻底，反革命分子趁隙而入。兽医许银生，从1949年起，窝藏两个反革命分子达四年之久，直到1952年一个被捕镇压，另一个被许银生放跑，许本人也有反革命活动。反革命分子程永信在1949年冬季从绥化城里迁到这个村，勾结地、富，拢络落后群众，破坏各种政治运动。
    村、社主要干部严重不纯。土改时的农会主任陈国法在解放前吸过大烟，与地主老婆搞男女关系，土改时搞假斗争，致使土改不彻底；土改后，他一直担任村社主要干部，常常在地、富家里吃喝。他对于党所交给的各项重大任务，一贯临阵脱逃。他曾三次逃避参军参战，每年购粮时装病不做工作。作风腐化堕落，群众揭露他与十二个妇女发生过不正当关系。另一个坏干部王云涛，在伪满时期吸过大烟，当过劳工小队长；土改时给地主隐藏过东西；土改后当村长，初级社主任，于1956年被提拔为乡人委的生产委员，分工领导旭升社的工作，他在当村长和初级社主任期间曾贪污三百多元，也和陈国法一样专走地、富路线，经常大吃大喝。他俩都与反革命分子关系密切。反革命分子程永信成了陈国法的“大谋士”，经常替他出谋划策，叫他走地主路线，在上级面前耍两面手法，拢络一批落后群众为自己捧场，以便保持统治地位等等。“龙找龙，熊找熊”，陈国法、王云涛掌握了大权，弄得旭升社的组织严重不纯。七名党支部委员当中，支委兼社主任陈国法是地富狗腿，支委兼副主任杨凤仪是蜕化变质分子，支书吴洪斌有严重资本主义思想，与陈、杨同流合污。两个组织委员，一个是混入党内的坏分子，一个出身于破落地主家庭。两个宣传委员，一个是小商贩出身。十一名管理委员当中，只有畜牧委员（贫农）和出纳员（新上中农）是比较纯洁的。二十名生产组长当中，有八名是地、富，三名是老上中农；三十名赶车老板当中，有十二名是地、富，五名是老上中农；十四名生产队的会计和记工员当中，有六名是地、富，三名是老上中农；粉房经理是漏划富农；大车队长是漏划地主。全社十九户地、富（土改后陆续分为五十户）有二十八人担任重要职务；二十六户老上中农有十二人担任重要职务。
    以陈国法为首的一批坏干部公开散播谬论说：“地、富老实，能干，没有他们办不好合作社。”“党员都落后，共青团员马列主义呱呱叫，不实干，复员军人挑皮捣蛋，贫困户是懒蛋子。”他们把地、富捧到天上，把好党员和积极分子踩到泥里。群众把旭升社叫作是：“被地、富操纵下的陈家天下。”
    旭升社走的哪条道路？
    群众说得很明白：“咱们社的干部是给地、富和有钱人办事的。他们是把党的阶级路线倒过来执行的。”“第一次翻身没翻好（指土改不彻底），第二次把我们翻到泥里去了（指合作化后依然贫困、受气）。”本来宝山乡第七村是一个好地方，是绥化县西部出名的“地眼子”，土地质量特别好，土改以后产量逐年提高，特别是办了两年高级社，每公顷产量达到三千八百斤，比1949年上升一倍，正是因为这一点使人迷惑，把它划为一类社，给它生产模范奖励。但是，什么人掌权就走什么样的道路。旭升社出现了形形色色的变相剥削，遭受了许多惊人的破坏。地、富、上中农生活蒸蒸日上，不少的贫农、下中农依旧贫困。地、富横行霸道，群众忍气吞声，群众的生产情绪受挫折，生产遭受重大损害。群众说：“就凭这个好地方，要是有好人领导，每公顷至少打粮四千五百斤，可能达到五千斤，我们的日子也不会过得像现在这样！”
    地、富和少数有严重资本主义思想的上中农，利用他们当主任，当生产队长、组长的地位，掌握指挥生产的实权，将挣工分多的好活先分给自己人去做，叫贫农、下中农去做挣工分少的重活，谁不服就给谁扣上“挑皮”、“懒蛋”的大帽子。地主张云乔一年做了三件活
  （修路、给粉房打水、喂猪），挣到一百八十个劳动日，地主王景阳抱着孩子看麻籽地，一天挣六分。贫农曲占山一年到头没歇工，只挣一百九十个劳动日，他说：“我们的穷根没有挖掉，还是有钱人吃香！”这一项无形的剥削是难以数字计算的。地、富、上中农和他们的子弟当上会计、记工员，用笔杆、算盘进行剥削更是花样繁多：富农王殿丰当两年队会计，贪污工分九百八十三分，现金二百零四元，他克扣社员的工分记在地、富账上；他在登记社员积肥数量时，对地、富的以少报多，多算工分，对贫农、下中农的以多报少，少算工分。粉房被四名地主掌握，他们在收购土豆时，对地、富的提秤提等，对贫农、下中农的压秤压等；好粉条分给地、富，霉粉条分给贫农、下中农。
    地、富、反革命分子的恶毒破坏使农业社损失惊人。他们的主要手段是大批伤害耕畜和糟踏庄稼、粮食。他们对耕马不喂不饮，多装载，快跑，狠打，故意打孕马，打马眼睛。高级合作化两年来，被他们弄死马八匹，打瘸马四匹，打瞎眼睛的马四匹，打掉驹的马三匹，使农业社损失九千零一十多元。兽医许银生治死农业社的马十三匹。地主孙景全当大车队长，把十五匹好马弄得瘦弱不堪。地主张云乔喂猪，饲料不筛净、不煮熟，喂死六口猪，还打掉两窝猪仔，损失八百元。他们在播种时故意少点种籽，把种籽点到垅旁，造成缺苗；锄草时大量砍苗；趟地时大量压苗；割庄稼时快割、毛割，大量糟损粮食；拉庄稼时沿途掉粮食；打场时故意打得不干净。据不完全的统计，这一项损失达七千二百三十元。再加上他们破坏农具、公物，使农业社损失共达二万五千多元，相等于1957年总产值的20％。
    旭升社的地、富和一部分上中农生活蒸蒸日上，贫农、下中农多数上升很慢，目前还有二十三户过着极端贫困的生活，衣、食、住条件相差悬殊。两年来，全社新盖房子一百二十一间，其中十九户地、富占五十三间，每户平均将近三间；二十六户老上中农占四十一间，每户平均一间半；一百四十八户贫农、新中农只占二十七间。地、富、上中农住着绿油门、玻璃窗、石灰抹顶、明亮宽敞的新房子，而一部分贫农、下中农还住在低矮、狭窄、阴暗的破房子里。地、富和上中农的大人、小孩都穿新衣服，老头穿皮袄，青年穿皮鞋，可是有一部分贫农穿着漏棉花的破衣服，冬天还戴着单帽子。贫农乔德一家六口人穿不上棉衣，大人无法出门做活，小孩只好围着火盆取暖。地、富户户有陈粮，共有陈粮二万多斤，把猪、鸡、鹅、鸭喂得又肥又胖，甚至高价出卖粮食，贫农曲忠厚没有吃粮，饿得一家五口痛哭一场。就在这样明显的比照之下，地、富骄傲地对贫农说：“你们翻了一回身还是受穷哪！”
    决心整放手整彻底整
    宝山乡是地、县委的重点乡，要在1958年带头实现“全国农业发展纲要”所要求的指标，每公顷产量六千斤。地、县、乡的领导上怕旭升社成为全乡前进中的绊脚石，下决心要改变旭升社的面貌。旭升社的整顿工作，主要是依靠党所经常教导我们的三件法宝进行的：第一，调查研究，做阶级分析；第二，坚定不移地贯彻执行党在农村的依靠贫农雇农的阶级路线；第三，采取了个别串连的群众路线的工作方法。工作组一到旭升社先用半月时间进行阶级调查，逐户访问贫农、下中农，从解决群众迫切需要解决的问题出发，联系群众，发现积极分子。有的群众慷慨地说：“好多年没有干部来我家了，你们北京来的同志来看我们，可见毛主席没有忘掉我们穷人哪！”我们通过贫农、下中农间的积极分子，用挂钩串连的方法，逐步把群众组织起来，向他们讲解党的阶级路线。经验证明：党的政策一和群众见面，立即成为一种伟大的物质力量，群众用党的阶级路线作镜子，对照社里情况，就恍然大悟，群情激昂，揭发大量材料，只用五天时间，我们就弄清了问题的性质。
    接着，我们一面发动群众，一面开展整党，形成里外夹攻之势。一开始，群众的注目点集中在社主任陈国法和副主任杨凤仪身上，经过鸣放、说理，把他们的真面貌揭穿，根据群众意见，县委立即宣布陈国法、杨凤仪撤职反省。群众欢欣鼓舞，斗志益壮。紧跟着斗争的锋芒转向地主、富农、反革命分子身上。我们又依法先后逮捕了五名反动地主和二名反革命分子，并且根据群众要求向地、富算了剥削账和破坏账。在分粮时分别扣出地、富二万六千多斤粮食分给了社员；在决算分配时，把地、富进行破坏所造成的损失扣回二万多元（一部分扣现款，一部分记在账上），留作农业社的公共积累。对地、富分子政治上处理，根据他们的一贯表现，分为社员，候补社员和管制生产三类分别对待，撤销他们在社内所担任的职务，重新选拔一批贫农，新下中农中间的积极分子充任。群众的政治优势树立起来了。党的支部委员会和社的管理委员会也进行了整顿、改选，纯洁了领导机构，建立了领导核心。同时，为了确保胜利成果，巩固社会主义阵地，县委决定把乡党委副书记和宣传委员下放到旭升社担任支部书记和社主任。就这样群众依靠党的领导和自己的力量，把这个隐藏了十余年的“小台湾”解放了。群众说：“我们重新翻了身，这回真正见到了青天”。
    整改高潮带来了生产高潮，群众社会主义热情空前洋溢。旭升社超额完成1957年的征购粮任务二百二十五万斤，比去年多送了四十五万斤，成为全乡每公顷土地送粮最多的一个社；送完粮紧接着送粪，一个多月时间，已经在三百公顷的土地上堆满了粪肥，占耕地面积的三分之一，估计到春节前可以做到全部耕地堆满粪肥，每公顷达到六万到九万斤，这个数目是空前的。从此旭升社踏上了社会主义的康庄大道。
