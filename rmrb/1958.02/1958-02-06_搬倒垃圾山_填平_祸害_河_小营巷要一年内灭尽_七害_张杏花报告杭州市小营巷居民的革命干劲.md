　　Overthrow the Garbage Mountain, Fill in the "Calamity" River: Xiaoying Lane to Eradicate "Seven Pests" Within a Year.
    Zhang Xinghua Reports on the Revolutionary Enthusiasm of Residents in Xiaoying Lane, Hangzhou.
    The news that Chairman Mao personally inspected the sanitation work in the Xiaoying Lane residential area of Hangzhou has rapidly spread throughout the country. Chairman Mao's spirit of going deep into the alleys, into residents' homes, and eagerly inquiring about residents' lives has not only given unparalleled encouragement to the residents of Xiaoying Lane in Hangzhou but has also become the driving force for the people of Hangzhou to accelerate the elimination of the "Four Pests." The people of Hangzhou are now marching towards the "Four Pests" with overwhelming revolutionary enthusiasm, determined to eliminate the "Four Pests" within two years, while also eliminating snails, cockroaches, and bedbugs, making Hangzhou a beautiful and clean "Seven-Free" city.
    Now let me introduce the situation of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the "Four Pests" in the Xiaoying Lane residential area of Hangzhou.
    The Xiaoying Lane residential area has 238 households with over 900 residents. Before liberation, Xiaoying Lane was covered with human and animal waste, and four garbage dumps, like small mountains, were left over from the Japanese puppet regime, containing dead cats, dead dogs, abandoned infants, and stillbirths. The clogged drainage ditches and manholes were overflowing with sewage all year round, emitting a foul odor, and flies and mosquitoes were flying everywhere. Rats often moved freely in droves. The residents had very poor hygiene knowledge and serious superstitious ideas, saying, "If you use too much water for bathing and washing your feet, you will have to drink it yourself in the underworld after death." Therefore, terrible diseases such as cholera, dysentery, malaria, typhoid fever, and encephalitis B were prevalent all year round, and the mortality rate reached an alarming level. Resident Yu Asan lived here for forty years and had thirteen children, nine of whom died before liberation. Shi Jinfeng gave birth to ten children, eight of whom died before liberation, leaving two children now. When the masses recalled the tragic situation at that time, they turned pale at the mention of it, saying, "That was a world of ghosts!"
    After liberation, the residents of Xiaoying Lane got rid of the oppression of poverty and launched a resolute struggle against the Four Pests, diseases, and death. In the patriotic health campaign against germ warfare in 1952, a moving scene of "moving mountains and overturning seas" emerged, clearing more than 700,000 catties of garbage, removing four garbage "mountains," and filling in the Suxi River, a "sea of calamity" that bred flies and mosquitoes. The manholes and drainage ditches were all dredged. Since then, sanitation work has begun to turn to regular operations. They organized a group of patriotic health activists, Communist Youth League members, and resident cadres to vigorously carry out health propaganda by presenting facts, calculating accounts, and explaining the reasons, and went deep into each household to visit and chat. Over the years, 38 resident health propagandists have been trained, and regular "hygiene classes" have been established. A "Patriotic Health Day" system has been established, with regular general health activities carried out twice a month. A system of responsibility for eliminating the Four Pests has been established by dividing areas and assigning responsibility, in addition to rotating sweeping twice a day, designated personnel are also responsible for regularly conducting reconnaissance work to eliminate the Four Pests in their area, and giving control and raids at any time. In addition, a health inspection system and an epidemic reporting system have been established.
    Through this series of work, the Xiaoying Lane residential area has completely changed its sanitary appearance. Since 1956, flies and mosquitoes have been basically eliminated, and the density of rats has also been greatly reduced. In the entire residential area, the "three cleans" have been basically achieved – personal cleanliness, indoor cleanliness, and environmental cleanliness, and the "five diligences" – diligent washing of clothes, diligent haircuts, diligent changing of bedding, diligent trimming of nails, and diligent bathing, and the "four no's" – no spitting, no littering of fruit peels and scraps of paper, no defecating anywhere, and no eating raw, cold, and unclean food. The atmosphere of paying attention to hygiene and loving cleanliness has been fully formed.
    The fighting spirit of Xiaoying Lane residents and other advanced units in eliminating the Four Pests and paying attention to hygiene has deeply inspired the people of Hangzhou, and their advanced experience has been rapidly spread throughout the city. Encouraged by these advanced areas, the Hangzhou Municipal People's Congress made a decision last December to eliminate the Four Pests in five years. In late December, the city held a mobilization rally of ten thousand people to eliminate the Four Pests, launching a vigorous campaign to eliminate the Four Pests. After a month of blitz, the city has eliminated more than 200,000 rats, more than 50,000 sparrows, and more than 12,000 catties of fly pupae, and also removed more than 8,000 tons of garbage. Under the education of vivid facts, the people of Hangzhou, from leaders to the masses, are full of confidence to complete the original five-year plan in two years and eliminate the "Seven Pests" cleanly. The two hundred households of residents in the Xiaoying Lane residential area that Chairman Mao inspected are particularly enthusiastic about eliminating the "Seven Pests." Every household is mobilizing everyone to catch rats and sparrows, eliminate mosquitoes and flies, clean up the environment, and strive to achieve "Seven-Free" within this year, to thank Chairman Mao for his concern.
    Finally, let me convey a few words from the residents of Xiaoying Lane: "The great happy event of Chairman Mao coming to Xiaoying Lane to inspect hygiene will always illuminate the hearts of all residents like the sun. All of us residents are determined to contribute all our strength to socialist construction, guarantee to eliminate the 'Seven Pests' within one year, and strive to report good news to Chairman Mao with greater achievements on this year's National Day!"

　　搬倒垃圾山  填平“祸害”河  小营巷要一年内灭尽“七害”
    张杏花报告杭州市小营巷居民的革命干劲
    毛主席亲自查看杭州市小营巷居民区卫生工作的消息，已经迅速传遍全国各地了。毛主席这种深入里弄、深入居民住宅，殷切垂询居民生活的精神，不仅给我们杭州市小营巷居民以无可比拟的鼓舞，而且也已成为杭州市全市人民加速消除“四害”的动力。杭州市人民现在正以排山倒海的革命干劲向“四害”进军，决心要在两年内消灭“四害”，同时还要消灭钉螺、蟑螂、臭虫，使杭州成为又美丽又清洁的“七无”城市。
    现在让我来介绍一下杭州市小营巷居民区开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的情况。
    小营巷居民区共有二百三十八户，居民九百多人。解放以前，小营巷遍地人粪、畜粪，四个像小山一样的垃圾堆，还是日伪时期留下来的，里面有死猫、死狗、弃婴和死胎。淤塞了的阴沟、窨井，常年污水四溢，臭气熏人，苍蝇、蚊子到处乱飞。老鼠经常成群结队，自由活动。居民中卫生知识很差，还有严重的迷信思想，说“洗澡、洗脚多用水，死到阴间要自己喝下去的”。因此，霍乱、痢疾、疟疾、伤寒、乙型脑炎等可怕的病魔常年流行，死亡率达到了惊人的程度。居民俞阿三在这里住了四十年，生了十三个孩子，解放前就死了九个；石金凤生了十胎，解放前死了八个，现在留下两个孩子。群众回忆到当时的悲惨情况，真是谈虎色变，他们说：“那是鬼的世界啊！”
    解放以后，小营巷的居民们摆脱了贫困的压迫，随着就向四害和疾病、死亡展开坚决的斗争。在一九五二年反细菌战的爱国卫生运动中，就出现了“移山倒海”的动人场面，清除了七十多万斤垃圾，搬掉了四座垃圾“山”，填平了宿舟河那条孳生苍蝇、蚊子的“祸海”，窨井、阴沟全部疏通了。从那以后，卫生工作开始转向经常化。他们组织了一批爱国卫生积极分子、共青团员和居民干部用摆事实、算细账、讲道理的办法，大力进行卫生宣传，并深入到一家一户去串门谈心。几年来，培养训练了三十八个居民卫生宣传员，建立了定期的“卫生课”；建立了“爱国卫生日”的制度，每个月定期进行二次普遍性的卫生活动；建立除四害地段责任制，除按地段包干，每日二次轮流打扫外，还指定专人负责，在本地段内定期进行除四害的侦察工作，随时给予控制和突击；此外还建立卫生检查制度和疫情报告制度。
    通过这一系列的工作，小营巷居民区已经彻底改变了卫生面貌。从一九五六年起，基本上消灭了苍蝇和蚊子，老鼠的密度也大为减少。在整个居民区已经基本上做到“三洁”——个人洁、室内洁、环境洁，“五勤”——勤洗衣、勤理发、勤换被褥、勤修指甲、勤洗澡，“四不”——不随地吐痰、不随地乱抛果皮纸屑、不随地大小便、不随便吃生冷和不干净的食物。讲卫生、爱清洁的风气已经全面形成。
    小营巷居民区和其他先进单位除四害、讲卫生的战斗精神，深深地鼓舞了全杭州市的人民，他们的先进经验已经迅速地在全市传布开来。在这些先进地区的鼓舞下，杭州市人民代表大会曾在去年十二月份作出五年消灭四害的决定。十二月下旬，全市举行除四害的万人誓师大会，大张旗鼓地开展除四害运动。经过一个月的突击，全市已经歼灭二十余万只老鼠，五万多只麻雀，一万二千斤的蝇蛹，还清除八千多吨垃圾。在生动的事实教育下，杭州市从领导到群众信心百倍，要在两年内完成原定五年的规划，把“七害”消灭干净。毛主席检查过的小营巷居民区二百多户居民除“七害”的劲头特别大，家家户户都在人人动手捕鼠捕雀，灭蚊灭蝇，清扫环境，争取提前在今年内做到“七无”，以答谢毛主席的关怀。
    最后，让我转达小营巷居民的几句话：“毛主席来到小营巷检查卫生的大喜事，永远像太阳照亮着全体居民的心。我们全体居民坚决要为社会主义建设贡献一切力量，保证在一年内消灭‘七害’，争取以更大的成绩在今年国庆节向毛主席报喜！”
