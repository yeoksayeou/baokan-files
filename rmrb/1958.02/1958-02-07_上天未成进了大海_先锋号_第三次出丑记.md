Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Cape Canaveral (United States) dispatch: The American "Vanguard" rocket made another fool of itself on the 5th. After rising a few thousand feet, it turned into two fireballs and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean.

On the morning of the 5th, after four days and nights of continuous work by the U.S. Navy personnel, the ill-fated "Vanguard" rocket was erected on the launch pad again, hoping to send the small, grapefruit-sized, three-pound satellite at the top of this slender, three-stage rocket into the high altitude.

When the launch time arrived, the liquid hydrogen and other fuels had been filled, and the spotlights illuminated the entire rocket. Observers standing more than a mile away could only see a cloud of smoke erupting from the tail of the rocket, with a pale yellow flame emerging from the smoke. The huge engine sound startled people for miles around. The rocket slowly rose vertically. One second, two seconds... When the rocket rose to a few thousand feet in the air, it suddenly turned to the right, changing direction. At this time, an observer shouted, "Something's wrong, it's going to explode immediately."

No sooner said than done, the rocket began to spin, and then suddenly exploded into two fireballs, one large and one small, in the sixtieth second. The larger fireball emitted white-hot light and immediately fell from the sky. The smaller fireball emitted green light and rose a little further before also falling to the ground.

At this time, the safety officer at the test site skillfully pressed a button to destroy the rocket. The larger fireball then turned red.

When the two fireballs looked like they were falling straight towards the test site, an observer shouted in panic, "Be careful, it's flying towards us!"

As they approached the ground, the two fireballs suddenly disappeared. In the deathly silence, two dark red rays flashed across the ocean surface three miles from the launch site, followed by two loud explosions. In this way, the rocket and satellite did not reach the sky, and "millions of dollars turned to ashes and were thrown into the Atlantic Ocean." (United Press)

In the past, when the United States failed to launch rockets, they often blamed it on unfavorable weather conditions. However, this time, both the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse reported that the rocket's explosion could not be blamed on the weather; at an altitude of 25,000 feet, the wind speed was only 69 miles per hour. And this rocket only rose a few thousand feet.

Hagen, the program director of the "Vanguard" rocket launch, had already arranged a press conference before the rocket launch, preparing to give a speech to reporters as soon as the rocket was successfully launched. Just as the news of the rocket launch failure made him dejected, the Pentagon made a phone call ordering him to cancel all press conferences.

　　上天未成进了大海
    “先锋号”第三次出丑记
    新华社6日讯　卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国在5日发射的“先锋号”火箭又出了一次丑。它上升了几千英尺，就化成了两团火球，钻到大西洋里去了。
    5日清晨，美国海军工作人员经过了整整四天昼夜不停的忙碌，把倒霉的“先锋号”火箭，又树立在发射场上，指望让这个七十多英尺的纤细的三级火箭把它顶端装着的只有小柚子那么大、三磅多重的小卫星送入高空。
    发射时间到了，液态氢等燃料已经填装完毕，聚光灯照得火箭周身发亮。站在一英里多以外的观察人员只见火箭尾部喷出一团烟雾，在烟雾中伸出一条淡黄色的火焰，巨大的发动机声惊动了几英里方圆的人们。火箭缓缓地垂直上升了。一秒钟、二秒钟……当火箭上升到几千英尺的空中的时候，只见火箭突然向右一侧，改变了方向。这时，有一个观察人员叫道：“出了事了，它立刻就要炸了。”
    说时迟，那时快，只见火箭开始旋转起来，接着在第六十秒钟猛地爆炸成了一大一小两个火球。较大的那个火球发出白热的光，立刻从空中栽下来；那个较小的火球发出绿色光芒，再向上升了一点点距离，也跟着往地上掉下来了。
    这时，试验场上的安全官员熟练地按了一下电钮，毁掉了这个火箭。那个较大的火球这时便转成了红色。
    当这两个火球看样子像朝着试验场地直落下来的时候，一个观察人员恐慌地叫了起来：“小心，它朝我们飞来了！”
    接近地面的时候，这两个火球忽然消失了。在死一样的寂静中，距离发射地点三英里外的洋面上，两条暗红色的光芒一闪而逝，紧接着传来了两声响亮的爆炸声。就这样，火箭和卫星没有上天，“几百万美元化成了灰烬，投进大西洋里去了。”（合众社）
    过去美国发射火箭失败后，常常说什么气候如何如何不利等等。但是，这一次美联社和法新社都报道说，这次火箭的爆炸不能怪天气，在二万五千英尺的高空，风速每小时才有六十九英里。而这个火箭只上升了几千英尺。
    “先锋号”火箭发射计划主持人哈根在火箭发射前早已安排好了一个记者招待会，准备等火箭一放射成功，就向记者发表谈话。正当火箭发射失败的消息使他垂头丧气的时候，五角大楼打去一个电话，命令他取消一切记者招待会。
