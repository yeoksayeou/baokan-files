Explanation of the Revised Drafts of Four Regulations by the State Council Regarding the Retirement of Workers and Staff Based on the Opinions of Workers and Staff in Various Regions
Ma Wenrui, Minister of Labor of the People's Republic of China

Since the State Council announced on November 20, 1957, the four draft regulations regarding the retirement of workers and staff, which had been approved in principle by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and departments organized workers and staff to conduct extensive discussions in conjunction with the rectification movement, according to the State Council's notification. According to reports from twenty-seven provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, the key units for this discussion totaled 11,851, with over 3,103,000 workers and staff participating, and a cumulative total of over 168,000 comments were made. In addition, various departments also received many letters from the people regarding these four regulations, with the Ministry of Labor alone receiving 1,845 letters, signed by 2,653 people. From the discussions and letters, it can be seen that the vast majority of workers and staff warmly support these four regulations of the State Council, believing that these regulations are in line with the principle of overall consideration and appropriate arrangements starting from the 600 million people, and are in line with the interests of the state and the vital interests of the vast majority of workers and staff. A very small number of workers and young apprentices initially had unclear understanding and ideological resistance to the significance and certain contents of individual drafts; however, after discussions and debates, they ultimately improved their understanding. Therefore, the gains of this mass discussion are not only the many beneficial opinions for reference and adoption for the four drafts, but also further enabled the vast majority of workers and staff to have a more comprehensive understanding of labor wages and labor insurance welfare issues, and improved their socialist consciousness. This also proves that the working methods of the Party and the People's Government in adopting a thorough mass line are completely correct and necessary. The opinions raised by workers and staff in various regions have been summarized and reported to the State Council after research by the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. According to the reports of the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, excluding duplicate opinions, a total of 103 major opinions were raised on the four drafts, including 45 on retirement regulations, 9 on regulations for general workers and odd-job workers, 22 on regulations for apprentices, and 27 on regulations for home visits. We and the relevant departments have conducted multiple studies on these opinions, and have revised the four draft regulations accordingly, and submitted them to the Standing Committee of the State Council for discussion and approval in principle. Now, I will make the following explanation on some of the more important revisions, and request approval from the plenary meeting for review.

I. Interim Provisions on the Handling of Retirement for Workers and Staff

For the original draft of this regulation, one article was added, and six articles were supplemented and revised.

First, an article was added regarding the handling of retirement for workers and staff who are disabled due to work and completely lose their ability to work (Article 5). There were existing regulations regarding the issue of retirement due to work-related disability for workers and staff in the "Labor Insurance Regulations" and the "Interim Measures for Handling the Retirement of State Organ Personnel." The reason we did not include this article when drafting this retirement regulation was that matters related to retirement due to work-related disability would still be handled in accordance with the original regulations. In this discussion, some workers and staff suggested that the issue of retirement due to work-related disability should also be included in this regulation. We believe that all the "Interim Measures for Handling the Retirement of State Organ Personnel" except for the issue of retirement due to work-related disability have been included in this regulation. In order to avoid the simultaneous existence of two regulations and to facilitate implementation, this opinion was adopted. It should be noted here that in the past, the treatment for retirement due to work-related disability was different because the "Labor Insurance Regulations" and the "Interim Measures for Handling the Retirement of State Organ Personnel" were not formulated at the same time, the objective situation at the time and our experience in this regard were different, so the prescribed treatment standards were also different. In the newly added Article 5, it is stipulated that the treatment for workers and staff of enterprise units implementing the "Labor Insurance Regulations" after retirement due to work-related disability will still be implemented in accordance with the "Labor Insurance Regulations"; the standard of retirement pay for workers and staff of enterprises and institutions that have not implemented the "Labor Insurance Regulations" after retirement due to work-related disability also refer to the provisions of the "Labor Insurance Regulations", that is, those who need help with their diet and daily life after retirement due to work-related disability will receive 75% of their original salary, and those who do not need help with their diet and daily life will receive 60%. In this way, the basic treatment for retirement due to work-related disability for enterprise and institution workers and staff, that is, the standard of retirement pay, is unified. As for the preferential treatment enjoyed by personnel who have made special contributions to society after retirement due to work-related disability, and the funeral subsidy and family pension for those who die after retirement due to work-related disability, the treatment stipulated in the "Labor Insurance Regulations" is slightly higher than the treatment stipulated in Article 4 (4) and Article 8 of this regulation. These differences have not been unified immediately in this regulation. Because how appropriate these treatments in the "Labor Insurance Regulations" are needs further research; at the same time, it is also planned to appropriately modify the "Labor Insurance Regulations" in the near future based on new circumstances and experience, expand the scope of implementation, and implement it in state organs and institutions as well. At that time, these treatments can be completely unified.

After adding this article, this regulation can completely replace the "Interim Measures for Handling the Retirement of State Organ Personnel" issued by the State Council in December 1955. Therefore, it is stipulated in the revised Article 14 that the Measures shall be repealed from the date of promulgation and implementation of these Regulations.

Second, regarding the conditions for retirement (Article 2), one item was revised and two items were supplemented. The revision is (3), which raised the working years condition a little. The original draft stipulated "continuous working years of five years and general working years of ten years," which is now revised to "continuous working years of five years and general working years of fifteen years." This is because retirement for the elderly requires the state to support the entire old age of the retirees, and only those who have made considerable contributions to society should enjoy this treatment. The original draft stipulated that ten years of work would be sufficient to enjoy retirement benefits, which was a bit too generous. Therefore, the opinion raised in the workers' discussion was adopted, and the general working years condition was raised by five years. Regarding the condition mentioned in this item that the employee is "physically weak and loses the ability to work and cannot continue to work" should be certified by a doctor, many workers and staff believed that it is sometimes difficult to prove this solely by a doctor, and there should also be a corresponding committee for identification. We also adopted this opinion and added the phrase "determined by the Labor Appraisal Committee" in this item.

An item (4) was added, that is, "Workers and staff with continuous working years of five years and general working years of twenty-five years, who are physically weak and lose the ability to work, and are determined by the Labor Appraisal Committee or certified by a doctor that they cannot continue to work," can retire. This is because many workers and staff have proposed that employees who are younger but have longer working years than the conditions in item (3) of this article and are physically weak and lose the ability to work should also enjoy retirement benefits; otherwise, it would not be fair compared with those who meet the conditions of item (3). We adopted this opinion and stipulated that the general working years condition for such personnel is twenty-five years, but no age condition is stipulated, because the purpose of adding this item is to take care of some workers and staff who are not necessarily old but have long working years and lose the ability to work and cannot continue to work so that they can enjoy retirement benefits.

An item (5) was also added, that is, "Staff members who have been engaged in full-time revolutionary work for 20 years or more and voluntarily retire due to physical weakness and inability to continue working" may also retire. This refers to a small number of veteran cadres and other staff members who have been engaged in revolutionary struggles for a long time and have become ill from overwork, are physically weak, and cannot continue to work. They should enjoy retirement benefits. Therefore, this item does not specify any other age conditions.

The standard of retirement pay for retirees who meet the conditions of item (4) is 40% to 60% of their original salary; the standard of retirement pay for retirees who meet the conditions of item (5) is 70% of their original salary, which are all stipulated in Article 4.

The last section of this article in the original draft, namely, "Workers and staff who are old or physically weak and lose the ability to work and cannot continue to work, but do not meet the conditions for retirement, should be treated as resignation," was deleted during the revision, because the issue of resignation for employees will be regulated separately, and there is no need to mention it here.

Third, regarding the funeral subsidy for retirees after death (Article 7 of the original draft, Article 8 after the revision), many workers and staff suggested that in order to avoid large differences, it should be stipulated as an absolute number. We adopted this opinion and revised the standard of this subsidy to a one-time payment of 50 to 100 yuan.

Fourth, regarding the payment method of various retirement expenses, many workers and staff suggested that it is best for the local civil affairs department to pay for all of them. After research with relevant departments, we believe that this opinion is good, but since this set of work is more complicated, it is not easy to change it all at once, and for the time being, it can only be paid separately by enterprises, civil affairs departments, and health departments in accordance with the current method. However, for the sake of clarity, several textual revisions have been made to Article 6 and Article 11 of the original draft (Article 7 and Article 12 after the revision).

Fifth, regarding the scope of application of these regulations (Article 12 of the original draft, Article 13 after the revision), we adopted the opinion of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and added the content that it also applies to workers and staff without military status working in the army.

Sixth, regarding the implementation rules of these regulations, Article 14 of the original draft stipulated that they should be formulated, promulgated and implemented separately by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Personnel Bureau of the State Council. After research, in order to facilitate unified regulations on some common issues and localized regulations on some local issues, it was revised to be formulated, promulgated and implemented separately by the Ministry of Labor and the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (Article 15 after revision).

In addition to the above-mentioned supplements and revisions, individual textual revisions were also made to Article 1, Article 3, Article 5, and Article 9 of the original draft (Article 1, Article 3, Article 6, and Article 10 after the revision).

In addition, there are some opinions that we did not adopt during the revision, the more important of which are:

First, some workers and staff have proposed that the age conditions stipulated in items (1) and (2) of Article 2 of these Regulations are still a bit high for workers in certain types of work. They cannot be competent in their original work when they reach the stipulated retirement age. Therefore, it is suggested that the retirement age should be appropriately lowered or different retirement ages should be stipulated according to different types of work. We believe that, generally speaking, it is more in line with China's actual situation to stipulate that male employees retire at the age of 60, female staff retire at the age of 55, and female workers retire at the age of 50. In item (2), lower retirement ages have already been stipulated for some special types of work. The newly added item (4) also takes care of some older workers. Therefore, the age conditions stipulated in items (1) and (2) can no longer be changed. If some employees cannot be competent in their original work when they do not meet the retirement conditions, they can be transferred to other work or arranged to change jobs as soon as possible.

Some people have also proposed that item (1) of this article does not distinguish between the retirement age of male workers and male staff, while the retirement age of female workers and female staff is stipulated to differ by five years. Can the distinction be made for both men and women, or not at all? We believe that due to the physiological characteristics of women and the different working conditions of female workers and female staff, it is still necessary for their retirement ages to be slightly different. As for male workers and male staff, although the working conditions are also different, the difference in health caused by the difference in working conditions is generally not large, so their retirement ages may not be distinguished. This is also stipulated after considering the interests of production, work, and the employees themselves. The original text of the draft can remain unchanged.

Second, regarding the standard of retirement pay, some workers and staff believe that the retirement pay stipulated in the draft differs by 10% of the original salary for every five years of continuous working years, and the level difference is too large. It is suggested that the number of levels should be increased to reduce the level difference, or it is stipulated that the retirement pay should increase by 2% of the original salary for each additional year of continuous working years. We believe that the standard of retirement pay stipulated in the draft according to the length of continuous working years is basically appropriate. Increasing the number of levels, reducing the level difference, or increasing retirement pay year by year according to working years will increase the total expenditure of retirement pay and raise the retirement pay standard for some retirees, or will lower the retirement pay standard for some retirees. In view of the fact that the standard of retirement pay stipulated in the draft is already not low and should not be increased further; it is also inappropriate to lower the treatment of some retirees. Therefore, the standard of retirement pay should remain as the original plan.

Some people suggested stipulating the minimum and maximum absolute amount of retirement pay. This opinion was also not adopted. Because the retirement pay stipulated in the draft can generally solve the living problems of retired workers and staff, it is not of practical significance to stipulate the minimum absolute amount. As for some workers and staff with low wages and heavy family burdens who have difficulties in family life after retirement, the problem can be solved through social relief. It is also unnecessary to stipulate the maximum absolute amount, because the wage standards of high-level workers and staff are not too high at present, and the retirement pay has been stipulated as a percentage of the original salary, so there is no need to make absolute amount restrictions.

There are also some opinions that need to be studied and resolved separately or should be stipulated in the implementation rules, such as the unified revision of the methods for calculating the working years of employees in enterprises and institutions, the scope of "high-altitude work" and "harmful to health work," and the meaning of "special contribution to society," etc., which will not be listed here one by one.

II. Interim Provisions on Wage Treatment for General Workers and Odd-Job Workers in Enterprises, Institutions, and State Organs

For the original draft of this regulation, two changes were made:

First, for the sake of clarity, in Article 1 regarding the wage standard for general workers, in the sentence "should be stipulated in accordance with the principle of equivalent to the income of farmers with relatively strong labor force in the average medium agricultural society in the local area plus the difference between urban and rural living expenses," the phrase "main source area of general workers" was added after the word "local." The People's Committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should divide the area and stipulate the wage standards separately in the implementation rules according to the agricultural economic situation of the main source areas of general workers. When recruiting general workers, each unit should also recruit them in an organized manner as much as possible in the same area.

Second, regarding the wage standard for odd-job workers, some People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities believed that the highest wage standard stipulated in the draft was slightly low, and advocated raising the first and second levels or the second and third levels. We adopted this opinion and changed "the wage standard for newly recruited odd-job workers in the future should be based on the principle of not exceeding the wage standard of the 30th level of the current wage standard table (1) for state organ personnel" in Article 2 to "28th level," raising it by two levels.

In addition, the scope of application of these regulations was mentioned in the discussions in various regions. We believe that it should now be limited to the scope stipulated in the draft. As for whether it applies to other personnel whose work is similar to general workers and odd-job workers, it will be studied separately in the future.

Other issues, such as some issues related to the implementation of the "old people, old standards," and the stipulation of different wage standards for general workers in different regions and for light and heavy labor, can be stipulated in the implementation rules.

III. Interim Provisions on the Length of Study and Living Allowance for Apprentices in State-Owned, Joint State-Private, Cooperative-Run, and Individually-Operated Enterprises and Institutions

For the original draft of this regulation, there were five changes:

First, regarding the standard of living allowance for apprentices (Article 2), some workers and staff and the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities believed that the pocket money for the second and third years could be considered for an increase of one or two yuan. We adopted this opinion and increased the maximum amount of pocket money for the second year by one yuan; increased the minimum amount of pocket money for the third year by one yuan, and increased the maximum amount by two yuan. And in order to facilitate the specific application in various regions, it was changed to stipulate only the minimum and maximum amounts for each year. The revised monthly pocket money is: 2 to 3 yuan in the first year, 3 to 5 yuan in the second year, and 5 to 8 yuan in the third year.

Second, regarding the issue of apprentices enjoying bonuses, allowances, and labor protection benefits (Article 3). Some workers and staff and the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities proposed that apprentices should be allowed to enjoy certain one-time bonuses (such as labor competition awards, rationalization proposal awards) and certain allowances that are labor protection in nature (such as night meal fees). How apprentices should enjoy labor insurance benefits should also be stipulated. We adopted this opinion and made corresponding revisions to Article 3. As for the details, they can be stipulated in the implementation rules.

Third, regarding the treatment of apprentices after being transferred to formal workers and staff (Article 4). For the sake of clarity, in this article, the phrase "according to the lowest wage standard for workers and staff in the unit" in the sentence "after apprentices are transferred to formal workers and staff, the wages for the first year" was revised to "production workers and staff," so as to avoid misunderstandings with the lowest-level workers in the same type of work or with odd-job workers.

Fourth, regarding the length of study and living allowance standard for apprentices recruited before the implementation of these regulations (Article 8). For the sake of clarity, the sentence "the length of study shall still be implemented in accordance with the original relevant regulations of the State Council" was added to this article. This mainly refers to the notice of the State Council on April 17, 1957, which stipulated that apprentices who had not been transferred to formal employees at that time should all extend the length of study by one year to one and a half years, and no further extension would be made after the extension period expires. It should still be implemented accordingly. In addition, in order to avoid creating complicated situations, it is affirmed that apprentices recruited before the implementation of these regulations shall all implement the original living allowance standard. Therefore, the last sentence of this article in the original draft, "However, apprentices can also voluntarily implement the new standard" was deleted.

Fifth, regarding the formulation of implementation rules and supplementary regulations (Article 10). The word "departments" was deleted from this article of the original draft. Because matters that need to be stipulated by various departments, such as the length of study, learning content and requirements, etc., have already been mentioned in Articles 1 and 2, and the implementation rules for other issues should all be stipulated uniformly by the local government. Therefore, various departments may not formulate separate implementation rules or supplementary regulations.

Some opinions, such as the idea that apprentices should be taken care of by the administrative aspect from the beginning of their studies, including food and clothing; the idea that apprentices should also earn money to support their families; the idea that the study should not have a term of three years or two years, and should be transferred to formal workers as soon as they can do the work, etc., are obviously excessive or one-sided requirements, and we have not adopted them.

Other issues, such as the length of study and living treatment issues after transferred or demobilized soldiers, cadres, and workers who change types of work become apprentices, and how to calculate the length of study in case of sick leave, etc., all need to be stipulated in the implementation rules.

IV. Interim Provisions on Holidays and Wage Treatment for Workers and Staff to Visit Relatives at Home

For the original draft of this regulation, one article was added, and two places were supplemented and revised.

The revised draft has one more article than the original draft, that is, Article 2 and Article 3 of the original draft were written as three articles, Article 2, Article 3, and Article 4. The content has not been changed, only slightly modified in structure and wording for the sake of clarity.

The content that has been supplemented and revised is:

First, the issue of conditions for granting leave (Article 3). An item was added at the end of this article: "Workers and staff who work in the same place as their fathers or mothers, but whose spouses are in other places and cannot use public holidays to return home for reunion, are also allowed to enjoy the treatment stipulated in these regulations." This is because some workers and staff have proposed that it is unfair not to give leave in this situation, and we have adopted this opinion.

Second, the issue of transportation expenses (Article 5 of the original draft, Article 6 after the revision). Some workers and staff have proposed that the transportation expense subsidy method stipulated in the draft, as long as it exceeds one-half or one-third of the individual's monthly salary, a portion will be subsidized regardless of whether the individual has financial difficulties. This is unreasonable and should only be subsidized if there are indeed difficulties. We adopted this opinion and revised this article to: "The round-trip transportation expenses required for workers and staff to visit relatives at home shall, in principle, be borne by the individual. If the individual does have difficulties in bearing it themselves, the administrative aspect of the unit where the worker or staff is located shall provide a discretionary subsidy, and the subsidy method shall be stipulated in the implementation rules." We believe that this is reasonable and appropriate, in line with the principle of frugality, avoids different treatment between ordinary workers and staff and school employees on winter and summer vacations, and also avoids creating difficulties for the future establishment of an annual leave system. However, a discretionary subsidy is stipulated for those who do have difficulties. As for the specific subsidy method, we believe that the subsidy standard set in Article 5 of the original draft can still be adopted, only moving it to the implementation rules. The advantage of this revision is that it can both take into account the necessary principles in the system and embody the flexibility in the implementation method.

There are a few opinions that we have not adopted:

First, some workers and staff believe that employees who already have spouses living with them at the work location should also appropriately enjoy the treatment stipulated in these regulations to visit their parents, and some people advocate that leave can be given once every three to five years, wages will be paid as usual, and transportation expenses will be borne by themselves. According to the opinions of most workers and staff and the opinions of most People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, after we reconsidered, we believe that it is still appropriate for this group of employees not to enjoy the treatment stipulated in these regulations. Because if leave is given in that way, the scope will be too wide, and the number of people enjoying home leave will increase by at least one or two times, which will increase expenses and personnel. For example, according to the estimation of the Shaanxi Provincial Labor Bureau, the workers and staff who can enjoy home leave according to regulations account for 33% of the total number of workers and staff in the province (200,000 people), and the workers and staff who live with their spouses but whose parents are in other places account for about 30% of the total number of workers and staff in the province (180,000 people). If the latter are also given leave once a year, the number of people visiting relatives will increase by nearly one time, requiring an additional expenditure of 5 million yuan in holiday wages and an increase of 3,600 reserve workers; if leave is given once every three years, the increase in expenses and personnel is still a very large amount. It can be seen from this that it is difficult for the state's financial resources to expand the scope of leave in that way at present. Therefore, this problem can only be solved better when the conditions are available in the future. At present, if some workers and staff who cannot enjoy the treatment stipulated in these regulations need to visit their parents and production and work permits it, the administrative aspect of the unit where they are located can handle it as personal leave.

Second, some workers and staff have proposed that the time required for the round-trip journey for home leave can be given separately according to actual needs, and should not be combined with the time to live at home. When drafting these regulations, we also intended to adopt this method, but later considered that giving separate journey leave would generally extend the holiday, making it difficult for the labor organization of each unit to arrange, which would be detrimental to production and work. Therefore, it was not adopted. Combining the leave, the holiday time is relatively fixed, and the workers and staff who visit relatives can go early and return early, and the original salary is paid for the entire holiday, which is beneficial to both the public and the private. However, in order to avoid creating unequal happiness and suffering for those who are far away and those who are nearby in the implementation, it can be considered in the implementation rules to make appropriate provisions for the number of days of leave within the specified range according to the amount of time required for the journey.

Third, a small number of workers and staff proposed that only workers and staff who have worked for two years or more should be able to enjoy the treatment stipulated in these regulations; young workers and staff without spouses can be given leave once every three years. These opinions have not been adopted, and the relevant articles remain unchanged from the original plan.

In addition, regarding the scope of application of these regulations, the boundary between being able or unable to use public holidays to reunite with family members, the method of calculating the individual's salary, etc., workers and staff in various regions have also raised some issues that need to be appropriately stipulated in the implementation rules.

The revised situation of the four drafts and the issues that need to be explained are as above. We believe that these four drafts, which have been discussed by the vast number of workers and staff and researched and provided opinions by the People's Committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and have been revised to some extent, are more in line with reality than the original drafts, which will certainly be conducive to the implementation of these regulations. However, it must also be stated here that these regulations are only interim regulations, which only solve some needs and possible problems in the current labor wage and labor protection welfare aspects. There are many other problems that need to be solved and improved in our work. In the past few years, in order to put the labor wage and labor protection welfare work on the track of adapting to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, we have formulated many rules and regulations. Many of these rules and regulations have played and are still playing an active role in China's revolution and construction. However, a considerable part of the rules and regulations, due to the limitations of our past experience and the changes in the situation in recent years, have now shown some shortcomings and problems, which are not conducive to improving the enthusiasm of the masses and developing production. For these, we must adopt a method that combines mobilizing the masses to discuss from the bottom up and systematically checking from the top down, and modify them according to the new situation and advanced experience. In the current rectification movement and the new upsurge of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, on the basis of the improvement of mass consciousness, some advanced initiatives have emerged, and many unreasonable problems that have been difficult to solve for a long time have been solved. The advanced experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant in improving welfare benefits and the Xiangjiang Machine Tool Plant in improving dormitory usage methods are the most obvious examples. Therefore, we should not regard rules and regulations as immutable things. Some of the past formulations need to be modified now, and some of the current formulations will also need to be modified in the future. In order to improve various rules and regulations, we must attach importance to the advanced initiatives of the masses like the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Xiangjiang Machine Tool Plant, and we must allow and encourage the masses to break those outdated rules and regulations that restrict the play of mass enthusiasm and the development of social productive forces, and formulate, try out, and promote some new rules and regulations that are conducive to improving the consciousness of the masses and developing the socialist cause in a more, faster, better, and more economical way based on the advanced experience of the masses. In the process of formulating the four regulations on retirement, etc., we have adopted the working method of the mass line, absorbed the experience of the masses, and made many modifications to the relevant regulations in the past. We believe that in the specific implementation of these four regulations, we should also adopt this working method of the mass line, and always pay attention to summing up the advanced experience of the masses, so as to improve certain rules and regulations in a timely manner, so that the rules and regulations always play a role in promoting China's socialist construction cause.

    根据各地职工的意见修改国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定等四个草案的说明
    中华人民共和国劳动部部长　马文瑞
    自从1957年11月20日国务院公布了经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会原则批准的关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定等四个草案以后，各省、自治区、直辖市、各部门即按照国务院的通知组织职工结合整风运动进行了广泛的讨论。据二十七个省、自治区、直辖市的报告，这次讨论的重点单位共一万一千八百五十一个，参加讨论的职工有三百一十万三千多人，讨论中提出的意见累计共十六万八千多条。此外，各部门还收到了许多关于这四项规定的人民来信，仅劳动部就收到了一千八百四十五封，署名者二千六百五十三人。从讨论和来信中可以看出，广大职工是热烈拥护国务院的这四项规定的，认为这些规定符合于从六亿人口出发统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针，符合于国家利益和广大职工的切身利益。很少数的职工和青年学徒起初对于个别草案的意义和某些内容认识不清，思想抵触；但是经过讨论争辩，他们最后也都提高了认识。因此，这一次群众性的大讨论的收获，不仅是对于四个草案提出了不少有益的可供参考采纳的意见，同时也进一步地使广大职工对于劳动工资和劳保福利问题有了较全面的认识，提高了他们的社会主义觉悟。这也证明了党和人民政府采取彻底的群众路线的工作方法，是完全正确的和必要的。各地职工在讨论中提出的意见，都经省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会研究后汇总报告给国务院。根据省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会的报告，除去重复的意见不计外，各地对四个草案提出的主要意见共一百零三条，其中关于退休规定的四十五条，关于普通工和勤杂工规定的九条，关于学徒规定的二十二条，关于回家探亲规定的二十七条。对于这些意见，我们和各有关部门曾经作过多次研究，并且据以对四个规定草案作了修改，提经国务院常务会议讨论和原则通过。现在我就一些比较重要的修改作如下的说明，请全体会议审查批准。
    一、关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定
    对于这一规定的原草案，增加了一条，补充和修改的有六条。
    一、增加了工人、职员因工作而致残废完全丧失劳动能力后退休处理的条文（第五条）。关于工人、职员因工残废退休的问题，在“劳动保险条例”和“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”中，原有规定。我们在草拟这个退休规定的时候所以没有列入这一条，意思是有关因工残废退休的问题，仍然都各按照原有的规定办理。这次讨论中，有些职工建议将因工残废退休问题也纳入这个规定，我们认为“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”中除因工残废退休问题外已全部纳入了本规定，为了避免两个规定同时存在，并且便于执行起见，所以采纳了这个意见。这里需要说明的是，以往因工残废退休的待遇，由于“劳动保险条例”和“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”不是在同一时候制定的，当时的客观情况和我们在这方面的经验有所不同，所以规定的待遇标准也就有些出入。这里新增加的第五条中，规定凡是实行“劳动保险条例”的企业单位的职工因工残废退休后的待遇，仍然按照“劳动保险条例”执行；没有实行“劳动保险条例”的企业、机关的职工因工残废退休后的退休费标准，也援用了“劳动保险条例”的规定，即因工残废退休后饮食起居需人扶助的为本人工资的75％，饮食起居不需人扶助的为60％。这样，就把企业、机关职工因工残废退休的基本待遇，即退休费的标准，统一起来了。至于对社会有特殊贡献的人员因工残废退休后所享受的优异待遇及因工残废退休人员去世后的丧葬补助费和亲属抚恤费，“劳动保险条例”中规定的待遇略高于本规定第四条（四）项和第八条规定的待遇。对于这一些差别，这个规定中没有马上加以统一。因为“劳动保险条例”中的这一些待遇究竟如何适当，需要作进一步的研究；同时，还准备在不久的将来根据新的情况和经验，将“劳动保险条例”作适当的修改后，扩大实施范围，在国家机关和事业单位也同样实行。那时，这些待遇就可以完全统一起来。
    增加了这一条以后，这个规定就可以完全代替国务院1955年12月发布的“国家机关工作人员退休处理暂行办法”，所以，在修改后的第十四条中规定：自本规定发布施行之日起，该办法即行废止。
    二、关于退休的条件（第二条），修改了一项，补充了两项。修改的是（三）项，将其中的工龄条件提高了一点，原草案规定为“连续工龄满五年，一般工龄满十年”，现在修改为“连续工龄满五年，一般工龄满十五年”。这是考虑到，退休养老是要由国家供养退休人员的整个晚年，必须是对于社会有过相当贡献的人才应该享受这种待遇。原草案规定劳动十年就可以享受退休待遇，条件是宽了一些，所以采纳了职工讨论中提出的意见，将一般工龄的条件提高了五年。对于这一项中所说的由医生证明职工是否合乎“身体衰弱丧失劳动能力，不能继续工作”的条件，不少职工认为仅仅由医生证明有的时候比较困难，还应该有相应的委员会加以鉴定。这个意见我们也采纳了，在这一项中添了“经过劳动鉴定委员会确定”一句。
    增加了一个（四）项，就是“连续工龄满五年，一般工龄满二十五年的工人、职员，身体衰弱丧失劳动能力，经过劳动鉴定委员会确定或者医生证明不能继续工作的”，可以退休。这是因为有许多职工提出，年龄小于而工龄长于本条（三）项条件的身体衰弱丧失劳动能力的职工，也应该享受退休的待遇，不然，与符合（三）项条件的人员比较起来，就显得不够合理。我们采纳了这个意见，并且把这类人员的一般工龄条件规定为二十五年，但是没有规定年龄条件，因为增加这一项的目的就是要照顾一些年岁不一定老而工龄很长、丧失劳动能力不能继续工作的职工能够享受退休待遇。
    还增加了一个（五）项，就是“专职从事革命工作满二十年的工作人员，因身体衰弱不能继续工作而自愿退休的”，也可以退休。这是指少数长期专门从事革命斗争而积劳成疾、身体衰弱不能继续工作的老干部和其他工作人员，他们是应该享受退休待遇的，因此，这一项也没有另外规定年龄条件。
    符合（四）项条件的退休人员的退休费标准为本人工资的40％至60％；符合（五）项条件的退休人员的退休费标准为本人工资的70％，都在第四条中作了规定。
    原草案本条的最后一节，即“工人、职员因为年老或者身体衰弱丧失劳动能力，不能继续工作，但是，又不具备退休条件的，应该以退职处理”，修改时删去了，因为关于职工的退职问题要另作规定，这里可以不提。
    三、关于退休人员去世后的丧葬补助费（原草案第七条，修改后的第八条），不少职工建议，为了避免高低悬殊，应该规定为绝对数。我们采纳了这个意见，将此项补助费的标准修改为一次发给五十元至一百元。
    四、关于各项退休费用的支付办法，不少职工建议最好一律由当地民政部门支付。经我们与有关部门研究，认为这个意见是好的，但是由于这一套工作比较复杂，一下不容易改变，暂时仍只能按照现行的办法分别由企业、民政部门、卫生部门支付。但是为了明确起见，将原草案第六条和第十一条（修改后的第七条和第十二条）作了几处文字修改。
    五、关于本规定的适用范围（原草案第十二条，修改后的第十三条），我们采纳了中国人民解放军总政治部的意见，增加了同样适用于在军队中工作的无军籍的工人、职员这个内容。
    六、关于本规定的实施细则，原草案第十四条规定分别由中华全国总工会和国务院人事局制定发布施行。经研究，为了便于对一些共同性的问题作统一规定和对一些地方性的问题能够因地制宜地规定，所以修改为分别由劳动部和省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会制定发布施行（修改后的第十五条）。
    除了上述一些补充和修改而外，对于原草案第一条、第三条、第五条、第九条（修改后的第一条、第三条、第六条、第十条）也作了个别地方的文字修改。
    另外有一些意见，我们在修改时未予采纳，其中较重要的是：
    一、有些职工提出，本规定第二条（一）、（二）两项规定的年龄条件对于某些工种的工人说来，还高了一点，他们达不到规定的退休年龄就不能胜任原工作，因而建议再适当降低退休的年龄或者按照不同工种分别规定退休年龄。我们认为就通常情况来说，规定男职工六十岁、女职员五十五岁、女工人五十岁退休，是比较合乎我国的实际情况的，而在（二）项中对于一些特殊工种已经规定了较低的退休年龄，新增加的（四）项又对于一部分老职工作了照顾，因此，（一）、（二）两项规定的年龄条件，可以不再变动。某些职工如果不够退休条件就不能胜任原工作的时候，可以调做其他工作，或者及早安排他们转业。
    还有人提出，本条（一）项对于男工人、男职员的退休年龄未加区别，而对于女工人、女职员的退休年龄则规定相差五岁，可否男、女都加以区别或者都不加区别？我们认为，由于女性的生理特点和女工人、女职员的劳动条件不同，她们的退休年龄略有差别，还是必要的。至于男工人、男职员，虽然劳动条件也不同，但是由于劳动条件不同而引起的健康情况的差别，一般的还不大，所以他们的退休年龄可以不加区别。这一点，也是考虑了生产、工作和职工本身的利益而规定的，草案原文可以不作变动。
    二、关于退休费的标准，有些职工认为草案所规定的每相差连续工龄五年，退休费相差本人工资的10％，级差大了一些，建议增多等级，缩小级差；或者规定为每增加连续工龄一年，退休费增加本人工资的2％。我们认为草案中按照连续工龄的长短所规定的退休费标准，基本上是适当的。增多等级，缩小级差，或者按照工龄逐年增加退休费，就要增加退休费的支出总额和提高部分退休人员的退休费标准，或者就要降低部分退休人员的退休费标准。鉴于草案规定的退休费标准已经不低，不宜再提高；降低部分退休人员的待遇也不妥当，因此，退休费的标准还以维持原案为好。
    有人建议规定退休费的最低和最高绝对数额。这个意见也未采纳。因为草案规定的退休费一般能够解决退休职工的生活问题，所以规定最低绝对数额的实际意义不大。至于某些工资低，而家累大的职工退休后家庭生活有困难的，可以从社会救济方面解决。规定最高绝对数额也不必要，因为目前高等级职工的工资标准也不算太高，退休费已经按照本人工资规定了百分数，就不需要再作绝对数的限制了。
    还有一些意见，需要另行研究解决或者应该在实施细则中加以规定的，例如关于统一修订企业和机关的职工工龄计算办法，“高空工作”、“有害健康工作”的范围，“对于社会有特殊贡献”的含义等问题，不在这里一一列举了。
    二、关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定
    对于这一规定的原草案，修改了两处：
    一、为了明确起见，将第一条中关于普通工的工资标准“应该以相当于当地一般中等农业社中劳动力较强的农民的收入加上城乡生活费用的差额为原则予以规定”一句中，在“当地”两字之后，增加了“普通工主要来源地区”一语。各省、自治区、直辖市应该在实施细则中根据普通工的主要来源地区的农业经济状况划区分别规定工资标准，各单位在招用普通工的时候也尽可能在同一地区有组织地招用。
    二、关于勤杂工的工资标准，一部分省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会认为草案规定的最高工资标准略低了一些，主张提高一、二级或二、三级。我们采纳了这个意见，将第二条“今后新录用的勤杂工的工资标准，应该以最高不超过现行国家机关工作人员工资标准表（一）第三十级的工资标准为原则”一句中的“三十级”，改为“二十八级”，提高了二级。
    此外，各地讨论中都提到本规定的适用范围问题，我们认为现在应该只限于草案规定的范围，至于是否适用于工作类似普通工、勤杂工的其他人员，以后另行研究。
    其他如有关实行“老人老标准”的一些问题，分别不同地区、轻重劳动规定不同的普通工工资标准的问题等，都可以在实施细则中规定。
    三、关于国营、公私合营、合作社营、个体经营的企业、事业单位的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的暂行规定
    对于这一规定的原草案，有五处修改：
    一、关于学徒的生活补贴标准（第二条），部分职工及省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会认为对于第二年、第三年的零用钱可以考虑再提高一、二元。我们采纳了这个意见，将第二年的零用钱的最高数提高了一元；第三年的零用钱的最低数提高了一元，最高数提高了二元。并且为了便于各地区具体运用，改为各年都只规定最低数和最高数。修改后的每月零用钱数为：第一年二元至三元，第二年三元至五元，第三年五元至八元。
    二、关于学徒享受奖励、津贴和劳保待遇问题（第三条）。有些职工和省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会提出，应该准许学徒享受某些一次性奖励（如劳动竞赛奖、合理化建议奖）及某些属于劳动保护性质的津贴（如夜餐费），学徒如何享受劳动保险待遇，也应该有所规定。我们采纳了这个意见，把第三条作了相应的修改。至于其中的细节，可在实施细则中规定。
    三、关于学徒转为正式工人、职员后的待遇（第四条）。为了明确起见，将本条中学徒转为正式工人、职员后第一年的工资，“按照所在单位工人、职员的最低工资标准执行”一句中的“工人、职员”，修改为“生产工人和职员”，以免误解为与同工种的最低级工人或者与勤杂工作比较。
    四、关于本规定实施以前招收的学徒的学习期限和生活补贴标准（第八条）。为了明确起见，在本条中添了“学习期限仍然按照国务院原来的有关规定执行”一句，这主要是指国务院1957年4月17日通知，该通知规定当时尚未转为正式职工的学徒一律延长学习期限一年至一年半，延长期满后不再延长。现在仍然应该照此执行。另外，为了避免造成复杂的情况，肯定凡在本规定实施以前招收的学徒一律仍然执行原来的生活补贴标准，所以删去了原草案本条最后“但是，也可以根据学徒本人的自愿执行新标准”一句。
    五、关于制定实施细则和补充规定（第十条）。删去了原草案本条中的“各部门”三字。因为需要由各部门规定的事项如学习期限、学习内容和要求等，已经在第一、第二两条中提到了，而其他问题的实施细则，都以由地方统一规定为好，所以各部门可以不另订实施细则或者补充规定。
    有一些意见，例如认为学徒一开始学习就应该由行政方面管吃又管穿；认为学徒也应该挣钱养家；认为学习不应有三年、二年的期限，会做活了就应该转为正式工人等等，这些显然是过高的或者是片面的要求，我们都未采纳。
    另有一些问题，例如转业、复员军人、干部、改变工种的工人当学徒后的学习期限和生活待遇问题，遇有病伤假如何计算学习期限的问题等等，都需要在实施细则中加以规定。
    四、关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定
    对于这一规定的原草案，增加了一条，补充和修改了两处。
    修正草案比原草案多了一条，就是将原草案第二、第三两条分写成第二、第三、第四三条，内容没有更改，只是为了清楚起见，在结构和文字上略有修改。
    内容有所补充和修改的是：
    一、给假的条件问题（第三条）。在本条的最后补充一项：“工人、职员与父亲或者母亲同在一地工作而配偶在外地又不能够利用公共休假日回家团聚的，也允许享受本规定的待遇。”这是因为有些职工提出，这种情况不给假是不公允的，我们采纳了这个意见。
    二、车船费问题（原草案第五条，修改后的第六条）。有些职工提出，草案规定的车船费补助办法，只要超过本人月工资的二分之一或者三分之一，就不问本人经济上是否困难，一律补助一部分，这样是不合理的，应该是确有困难的才给予补助。我们采纳了这个意见，将本条修改为：“工人、职员回家探亲所需用的往返车船费，原则上由本人自理，如果本人自理确有困难的时候，由工人、职员所在单位的行政方面酌予补助，补助办法在实施细则中规定。”我们认为这样是合理的、适当的，符合节约的原则，避免在一般职工与放寒暑假的学校员工之间产生待遇不同，也避免了给今后建立年休假制度造成困难。但是对于确有困难的又规定了可以酌予补助。至于补助的具体办法，我们认为仍然可以采用原草案第五条所定的补助标准，只是把它移到实施细则中去。这样修改的好处是既能照顾到在制度方面坚持应有的原则性、又能体现在实施方法上的灵活性。
    有几个意见我们没有采纳：
    一、一部分职工认为在工作地点已经有配偶同住的职工，也应该适当享受本规定的待遇探望父母，并且有人主张可以三、五年给假一次，工资照发，路费自备。根据多数职工的意见和大部分省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会的意见，经我们再次考虑，认为这部分职工仍以不享受本规定的待遇为宜。因为那样给假的话，面就太宽，享受探亲假的人数至少要增加一、二倍，会增加开支和人员。例如据陕西省劳动局的估算，该省按规定可以享受探亲假期的职工占全省职工总数的33％（二十万人），有配偶同住而父母在外地的职工约占全省职工总数的30％（十八万人），如果后者也每年给假一次，探亲的人数就增加将近一倍，要多开支假期工资五百万元，要增加预备工三千六百人；如果三年给假一次，需要增加的开支和人员也还是一个很大的数目。由此可见目前要那样扩大给假的范围，是国家财力所难以办到的。所以这个问题只能待以后条件具备了的时候再作更好的解决。目前有些不能享受本规定待遇的职工如果需要探望父母而生产和工作上又允许的话，可以由所在单位的行政方面按照事假处理。
    二、有些职工提出，回家探亲返往旅途所需用的时间，可以另按实际需要给路程假，不要和回家居住的时间合并给假。我们在草拟这个规定的时候，也曾经打算采用这种办法，但是后来考虑到，另给路程假总的说来会延长假期，使各单位的劳动组织不好按排，对于生产、工作不利，所以没有采用。合并给假，假期时间比较固定，探亲的职工可以早去早归，假期又全部照发原工资，这于公于私都是有利的。但是，为了使执行中避免造成路远的和路近的苦乐不均，可以考虑在实施细则中对于给假的天数在规定范围内根据旅途所需时间多少作适当的规定。
    三、少数职工提出，应该规定工作满二年的职工才能享受本规定的待遇；没有配偶的青年职工可以三年给假一次。这些意见都未予采纳，有关的条文都维持原案不变。
    此外，关于本规定的适用范围，能够或者不能够利用公共休假日与家属团聚的界限，本人工资的计算办法等等，各地职工也都提出了一些问题，需要在实施细则中作适当的规定。
    四个草案修改的情况和需要说明的问题，就如上述。我们认为经过广大职工讨论和各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会研究提供意见，又作某些修正的这四个草案，比原草案更加切合实际，这必将有利于这些规定的贯彻实施。但是这里还必须说明，这些规定都只是暂行规定，仅仅解决了当前劳动工资和劳保福利方面的某些需要并且可能解决的问题。在我们工作中需要解决和改进的，还有其他许多问题。在过去几年中，为了使劳动工资和劳保福利工作走上适应社会主义革命和社会主义建设的轨道，我们曾经制定了不少规章制度。这些规章制度，有许多对于我国的革命和建设事业起过和仍然起着积极的作用。但是，也有相当一部分规章制度，由于我们过去经验的局限性和几年来情况的变化，现在已经显露出若干缺点和毛病，不利于提高群众的积极性和发展生产。对于这些，必须采取由下而上地发动群众讨论和由上而下地系统地检查相结合的方法，根据新的情况和先进经验，加以修改。在目前整风运动和多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的新高潮中，在群众觉悟提高的基础上，已经出现了一些先进的创举，许多长期难于解决的不合理问题，得到了解决。石景山发电厂改进福利待遇办法和湘江机器厂改进宿舍使用办法的先进经验，就是最明显的例子。因此，我们不应该把规章制度当做一成不变的东西，过去制定的现在需要作某些修改，现在制定的将来也要作某些修改。为了改进各种规章制度，我们必须重视像石景山发电厂和湘江机器厂这样的群众的先进创举，必须允许并且鼓励群众打破那些限制发挥群众积极性和发展社会生产力的过时的规章制度，根据群众的先进经验制订、试行和推广一些有利于提高群众的觉悟和多、快、好、省地发展社会主义事业的新的规章制度。我们在制定退休等四个规定的过程中，曾经采取了群众路线的工作方法，吸取了群众的经验，对于过去的有关规定作了不少修改。我们认为，在这四个规定具体实施的时候，同样应该采取这种群众路线的工作方法，随时注意总结群众中的先进经验，以便及时地改进某些规章制度，使规章制度时刻起着促进我国社会主义建设事业的作用。
