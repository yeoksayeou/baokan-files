(Reported by this newspaper) Nanjing *Xinhua Daily* published an editorial on February 14th entitled "To Leap Forward, One Must Work Hard." The editorial stated: "Looking back at the ideological development process in the movement is very educational. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee last year, everyone has been talking about keeping their thinking in line with the situation. We have talked about it and worked hard to do so. Through the education of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the promotion of extensive airing of views, great debates, and the inspiration of the production movement itself, people have been advancing step by step, continuously. For example, the shift from certain right-leaning conservatism to boosting enthusiasm, from gradual progress to a great leap forward, from 'reassuring' targets to 'sweat' targets, from weak measures to effective measures, from sitting in the office to walking out of the office – all these are great advancements. It is wrong not to see these advancements. However, it must be admitted that these advancements are still not enough. The understanding is certainly not enough or consolidated enough, and the practice is especially insufficient. People standing in the torrent of the movement feel and realize at all times that the imbalance between the current advanced targets and hard work is the most prominent contradiction. Only by resolutely working hard can this contradiction be resolved. When the targets were not advanced enough, ordinary work might not reveal a sharp contradiction, but when the targets have jumped several times, the situation is different, and ordinary work is very unsuitable. Only by resolving to work hard, catching up quickly, and moving forward can we break this imbalance, achieve balance, and pave the way for a new imbalance on a new foundation in the future, promoting the continuous advancement of the great production movement. It must be seen that when hard work becomes the focus, the great leap forward is already linked to hard work."

The editorial stated: "In the eyes of Marxists, working hard for the revolution and working hard to build the country is a strong manifestation of a revolutionary outlook on life and the world. ... All proletarian revolutionary fighters should promote this revolutionary spirit and style of hard work, fully mobilize the masses to work hard, and cadres should take the lead in working hard and set an example."

The editorial said that some people believe that "'it's freezing cold, the masses have already worked hard, and asking them to work even harder is a lack of a mass viewpoint.' It seems that those who say this have a strong petty-bourgeois sentimentality towards themselves and the masses. They have many wrong ideas and confused concepts: first, they do not understand that our country is poor and blank, and on the basis of the victory of the revolution, the people urgently demand to change the backward state of our economy and culture, to build a prosperous and strong motherland, and to strive for a prosperous and happy life. This is precisely the strong desire, urgent demand, and greatest interest of our 600 million people. Today, we are fully mobilizing the masses to work hard and cadres are taking the lead in working hard precisely to realize this urgent demand of the people. Realizing the strong desire of the people represents the greatest interest of the masses, and it is the greatest mass viewpoint. How can it be said to be detachment from the masses or a lack of a mass viewpoint? Second, they do not know that although the name is the same, 'hard work' has completely different content and meaning under two different systems. Under all exploiting systems, the working people work hard for the exploiting classes, driven by the whip and hunger of the exploiters, forced, extorted, and monitored to work hard, and in extremely harsh living and working conditions, suffering from hunger and cold, and full of misery. This kind of hard work is slavish, indeed unbearable, and the working people must resolutely resist it. However, under the socialist system, the situation is completely different. ... The hard work of the working people is for themselves and for the entire society, it is conscious and voluntary hard work for a great and unprecedented cause, it is hard work under the conditions of preliminary improvement of living and working conditions, and continued gradual improvement of living and working conditions with the development of production. This kind of hard work is happy, joyful, and is the inevitable result of the surging enthusiasm of the working people in building socialism. In the eyes of the proletariat and the working people, this kind of hard work is also a pleasure. It is called hard work because it is done fiercely, intensely, unusually, and quickly, well, and economically, using all the skills, all the solutions, and all the energy to work hard and creatively. ... Anyone who thinks that our advocacy of hard work today means not caring about the masses, or lacking a mass viewpoint, is failing to distinguish the fundamental difference between hard work under the socialist system and the exploiting system, failing to draw a line between the two systems and the two kinds of hard work, and therefore failing to analyze what is hardship and what is not hardship from the proletarian standpoint."

The editorial concluded: "The achievements of construction will not come naturally, and the great leap forward cannot be realized out of thin air. Let us, all Party comrades and all revolutionary patriots, together with the people, go all out, aim high, work hard, and resolutely leap forward. We must repeat it again: only hard work can lead to a great leap forward; without hard work, there can be no great leap forward; to leap forward, one must work hard!"

    只有苦干　才能跃进
    新华日报评先进指标和苦干之间的矛盾
    本报讯　2月14日南京新华日报以“要跃进就得苦干”为题发表社论。社论说：“回顾一下运动中的思想发展过程，是很有教育意义的。去年党的三中全会以来，大家都在谈论着认识跟上形势。这样谈论了，也这样努力做了，经过党中央和毛主席的教育，经过大鸣大放大辩论的推动，经过生产运动本身的启示，人们已在步步前进，不断地前进。比如从某些右倾保守到鼓起干劲，从缓进到跃进，从‘定心’指标到‘出汗’指标，从措施无力到措施得力，从坐办公室到走出办公室，这都是很大的进步。看不到这些进步是不对的。但是必须承认，这些进步还是不够的。认识上固然还不够还不巩固，实践上则尤其不够。站在运动激流中的人们，处处感触到、时时体会到，现在先进的指标与苦干之间的不平衡是最突出的矛盾，只有下决心苦干，才能解决这个矛盾。当指标还不够先进的时候，一般地干干，也许还显不出尖锐的矛盾，但是当指标跳了几跳以后，情况就不同了，一般地干干已是很不适应的了。只有决心苦干，急起直追，赶上前去，才能打破这个不平衡，达到平衡，并为将来在新的基础上的新的不平衡开辟道路，推动大生产运动的不断前进。必须看到，当苦干跃居中心以后，跃进已经和苦干联系在一起。”
    社论说：“在马克思主义者看来，苦干革命、苦干建国，这是革命人生观、世界观的强烈表现。……所有无产阶级的革命战士，都应该发扬这种苦干的革命精神和革命作风，充分发动群众苦干，干部自己带头苦干，做出样子。”
    社论说，有人认为“‘天寒地冻，群众已经干了，再要苦干，未免缺乏群众观点。’看来，说这种话的人，对自己、对群众都存在着浓厚的小资产阶级温情主义。他们有许多错误思想和糊涂观念：一则，他们不了解，我国又穷又白，在革命的胜利基础之上，人民迫切要求改变我国经济上和文化上落后的状况，要求建设繁荣、富强的祖国，争取过富裕、幸福的生活。这正是我国六亿人民的强烈愿望、迫切要求和最大的利益。今天我们充分发动群众苦干，干部带头苦干，正是为了实现人民群众的这个迫切要求。实现人民群众的强烈愿望，是代表群众的最大利益，是最大的群众观点，怎么反而是什么脱离群众和什么缺乏群众观点呢？二则，他们不知道，名称虽然同为苦干，但在两种不同的制度下，它的内容和含义却截然不同。在一切剥削制度下，劳动人民是为剥削阶级苦干，是受剥削者的皮鞭和饥饿的驱使，被逼迫着、被勒索着、被监视着去苦干，并且是在极恶劣的生活条件和劳动条件下，饥寒交迫、满腹辛酸去苦干，这种苦干，是奴隶式的，的确是苦不堪言的，是劳动人民要坚决反抗的。但是在社会主义制度下，情况就完全不同了。……劳动人民的苦干，是为自己也为整个社会苦干，是自觉自愿为一个伟大的前无古人的事业苦干，是在初步改善了生活和劳动条件，而且还要继续不断地随着生产发展逐步改善生活和劳动条件下苦干。这种苦干，是欢欢喜喜、心花怒放的苦干，是劳动人民建设社会主义的强烈积极性高涨的必然结果。在无产阶级和劳动人民看来，这种苦干同时就是愉快。其所以称为苦干者，乃言其干得猛烈，干得紧张，干得不平常，干得多快好省，是拿出了全副本领、全套解数、全身精力来大干特干、创造性地干。……谁如果以为我们今天提倡苦干，就是不体念群众，就是缺乏群众观点，谁就是分不清社会主义制度之下和剥削制度之下苦干的根本区别，划不清两个制度两种苦干之间的界限，也就是不能站在无产阶级的立场上来分析何者为苦、何者为不苦的问题。”
    社论最后说：“建设的成就是不会自然到来的，大跃进也不是凭空可以实现的，让我们全党同志和所有革命志士，同人民群众一起，鼓足干劲，力争上游，切实苦干，坚决跃进吧。我们还得再重复一遍：只有苦干，才能跃进；不苦干，就不能跃进；要跃进，就得苦干！”
