    Technical Revolution in the Soy Sauce Industry
    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reports that the former Ministry of Food Industry organized technicians from Beijing, Shanghai and other places to conduct salt-free fermentation experiments at the Beijing Soy Sauce Factory, which have recently been successful. The National Food Professional Conference is about to promote this experience.
    Using salt-free fermentation to make soy sauce, the production cycle is only four days, which is equivalent to one-tenth of the production cycle of the general warm brewing method. The raw material utilization rate is also increased by more than 10%. Therefore, it can greatly increase soy sauce production, accelerate capital turnover, and save a large amount of grain for the country. According to relevant departments, if salt-free fermentation is promoted in soy sauce factories across the country, soy sauce production can be increased more than twelve times with only slight adjustments to equipment and without large-scale investment in capital construction.
    Salt-free fermentation increases the protein and amino acids in soy sauce, making the taste more delicious. This kind of soy sauce does not need to be mixed with chemical oil to increase the umami taste; in addition, the production cycle is shortened, which can reduce production management costs, and the cost will be greatly reduced. Factories with the conditions can also combine salt-free fermentation to produce extra-high-grade soy sauce for export. (Bao Qi'an)

    酱油工业的技术革命
    本报讯　前食品工业部组织北京、上海等地技术人员在北京市酱油厂进行无盐发酵试验，最近已经成功。全国食品专业会议即将推广这一经验。
    用无盐发酵的办法制酱油，生产周期只要四天，相当于一般温酿法生产周期的十分之一。原料利用率也提高了10％以上。因此可以大大增加酱油产量，加速资金周转，并为国家节约大批粮食。据有关部门计算，在全国酱油厂推广无盐发酵，只要略加调整设备，不必大量投资进行基本建设，便可增产酱油十二倍以上。
    无盐发酵，使酱油中的蛋白质和氨基酸增加，味道更加鲜美。这种酱油不需要掺入为增加鲜味的化学油；加以生产周期缩短，可以减少生产管理费用，成本将大为降低。有条件的工厂还可结合无盐发酵生产可以出口的特高级酱油。　　　　　　　　（包启安）
