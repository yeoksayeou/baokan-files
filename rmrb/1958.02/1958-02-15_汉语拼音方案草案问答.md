Q&A on the Draft Scheme for Hanyu Pinyin
Ye Laisi

19. Why does this scheme have variable readings?

The entire scheme has three variable readings (when the same letter has more than one pronunciation, it is called a variable reading):

(1) The final i is read as "yi," and also serves as the final for syllables such as "zhi, chi, shi, ri, zi, ci, si." In other words, zhi, chi, shi, ri, zi, ci, si, should be read as 知, 痴, 诗, 日, 资, 雌, 思 (zhī, chī, shī, rì, zī, cí, sī).

(2) The final e is read as "e" (厄) in most cases, but the e in the compound finals ie (耶), üe (约) is not read as "e" (厄), but should be read as ㄝ in Zhuyin (Bopomofo). In Beijing pronunciation, only the word "诶" (ēi), which is an interjection indicating a greeting or agreement, can form a syllable by itself. This word is written as ê.

(3) The final ㄦ (i.e., the characters 儿, 二, 而, 尔, 耳, etc.) is written as er in Pinyin. When used as a suffix, it is written as r, such as ertong (儿童 – children), erduo (耳朵 – ears), xiaohair (小孩儿 – kid), huar (花儿 – flower). Therefore, r has two pronunciations: when used as an initial consonant, it is read as "ri"; when used as a final, it is read as "er."

Beijing pronunciation has eight simple vowels, but Latin letters only have five vowel letters: a, e, i, o, u. Since most people are unwilling to create new letters, the only option is to adopt the method of variable readings.

20. How many omissions or abbreviations are there in this scheme?

There are the following three types of omissions or abbreviations:

(1) Finals in the ü row (i.e., the four finals ü, üe, üan, ün), except when forming syllables independently, only combine with the five initials n, l, j, q, x. When ü follows the initials n, l, it should be written as nü (女), lü (吕); after j, q, x, it is written as ju (居), qu (区), xu (虚), with the two dots above ü omitted. Because in Beijing language, u (乌) cannot appear after the initials j, q, x, only i (衣) or ü (迂) can, so omitting the two dots above ü will not cause confusion.

(2) When the compound finals iou, uei, uen are preceded by an initial, they are all abbreviated as iu, ui, un, such as liu (刘), jiu (久), niu (牛), gui (归), kui (亏), hui (会), dun (顿), tun (吞), hun (混).

(3) When giving phonetic transcriptions to Chinese characters, the initials zh, ch, sh, ng can be abbreviated to ?, ?, ?, ? to make the spelling shorter.

21. How are the letters y and w used?

The pronunciation of y is the same as i, read as "yi"; the pronunciation of w is the same as u, read as "wu." The usage of these two letters is as follows:

When finals in the i row have no initial consonant and form an independent syllable, i is written as yi (衣), ia is written as ya (呀), ie is written as ye (耶), iao is written as yao (腰), iou is written as you (忧), ian is written as yan (烟), in is written as yin (因), iang is written as yang (央), ing is written as ying (英), iong is written as yong (雍). It must be noted that y is added to yi (衣), yin (因), ying (英); in other cases, i is changed to y. Because y is not a vowel, the i-to-y change cannot be applied in i, in, ing: y, yn, yng do not have vowels and cannot form a final. As for ia becoming ya, this problem does not arise.

When finals in the u row have no initial consonant and form an independent syllable, u is written as wu (乌), ua is written as wa (蛙), uo is written as wo (窝), uai is written as wai (歪), uei is written as wei (威), uan is written as wan (弯), uen is written as wen (温), uang is written as wang (汪), ueng is written as weng (翁). It must be noted that w is added to wu (乌), and in other cases, u is changed to w.

When finals in the ü row have no initial consonant and form an independent syllable, ü is written as yu (迂), üe is written as yue (约), üan is written as yuan (冤), ün is written as yun (晕). It must be noted that when finals in the ü row form independent syllables, y is added in front, and the two dots above ü are omitted.

Therefore, "意义" (yìyì - meaning) should be written as yiyi, "烟叶" (yānyè - tobacco) as yanye, "英勇" (yīngyǒng - heroic) as yingyong, "语言" (yǔyán - language) as yuyan, "原因" (yuányīn - reason) as yuanyin, "文艺" (wényì - literature and art) as wenyi, "义务" (yìwù - duty) as yiwu, "月夜" (yuèyè - moonlit night) as yueye, "威武" (wēiwǔ - mighty) as weiwu.

y and w can make the boundaries of syllables clear and avoid confusion. For example, "礼物" (lǐwù - gift) is written as liwu, "主义" (zhǔyì - ideology) is written as zhuyi, so the syllable boundaries are clear. If they were written as liu or zhui, it would be impossible to distinguish between "礼物" and "留" (liú - to stay), "主义" and "追" (zhuī - to chase). At the same time, it conforms to China's habit of using Latin letters. For example, "杨" (Yáng - surname Yang) is written as yang, "王" (Wáng - surname Wang) is written as wang, which are more in line with popular social conventions than iang and uang.

22. How are the tone marks defined?

The four tone marks for level tone (yinping), rising tone (yangping), falling-rising tone (shang), and falling tone (qu) in the scheme adopt the original Zhuyin (Bopomofo) tone marks. Tone is the pitch and inflection of speech. The level tone in Beijing speech is a high-level tone, consistently balanced, so it is represented by a horizontal line. The rising tone is a mid-rising tone from mid-level to very high, so it can be represented by a stroke from the lower left to the upper right. The falling-rising tone is a contour that first falls and then rises, so it can be represented by a v-shaped curve. The falling tone is a high-falling tone from the highest level to the lowest level, so it can be represented by a stroke from the upper left to the lower right. These four tone marks roughly represent the state of these four tones in Beijing speech. If the tones in Beijing speech are drawn as diagrams of pitch and inflection, then these four tone marks basically correspond to these diagrams.

23. How is the separating mark used?

In a polysyllabic word, sometimes the boundaries between syllables may become blurred, and the separating mark can be used to separate them. For example, "档案" (dàng'àn - file) should be written as dang'an, only "单干" (dāngān - to work on one's own) is written as dangan; piao is "飘" (piāo - to float), pi'ao is "皮袄" (pí'ǎo - leather jacket).

    汉语拼音方案草案问答
    叶籁士
    19、这个方案为什么有变读？
    整个方案中有三个变读（同一个字母有不止一种读法，叫做变读）：
    （一）韵母i读作“衣”，又兼作“知、痴、诗、日、资、雌、思”等音节的韵母。换句话说，zhi，chi，shi，ri，zi，ci，si，应该读作知、痴、诗、日、资、雌、思。
    （二）韵母e在绝大多数场合读作“厄”，但是复韵母ie（耶）、üe（约）中的e不读“厄”，应该读作注音字母的ㄝ。在北京语音中，ㄝ单独自成音节的只有“诶”这一个字，它是表示招呼或答应的语气词。这个词就写作ê。
    （三）韵母ㄦ（即汉字儿、二、而、尔、耳等字）拼音字母写作er，作词尾时写成r，如ertong（儿童）、erduo（耳朵）、xiaohair（小孩儿）、huar（花儿）。因此r就有两种读法：作声母用时读作“日”，作韵母用时，读作“儿”
    北京语音中有八个单母音，而拉丁字母只有a，e，i，o，u五个母音字母，既然多数人不愿意造新字母，那就只有采用变读的办法。
    20、这个方案中有几种省略或者省写？
    有以下三种省略或者省写：
    （一）ü行韵母（即ü，üe，üan，ün四个韵母），除了单独自成音节之外，只跟n，l，j，q，x这五个声母相拼。ü在声母n，l后面，应该写作nü（女），lü（吕）；在j，q，x的后面，就写作ju（居）、（qu）区，（xu）虚，ü上两点省略。因为在北京语言中，在声母j，q，x后面不可能出现u（乌），只可能出现i（衣）或者ü（迂），因此ü上两点省去，不会发生混淆。
      （二）复韵母iou，uei，uen，前面加声母的时候，一律省作iu，ui，un，如liu（刘），jiu（久），niu（牛），gui（归），kui（亏），hui（会），dun（顿），（tun）吞，（hun）混。
    （三）声母zh，ch，sh，ng，在给汉字注音时，为了使拼式简短，可以省写作?，?，?，?。
    21、y、w这两个字母怎末用法？
    y的发音跟i一样，读作“衣”；w的发音跟u一样，读作“乌”。这两个字母的用法如下：
    i行的韵母前面没有声母，而独立自成音节时，i写成yi（衣），ia写成ya（呀），ie写成ye（耶），iao写成yao（腰），iou写成you（忧），ian写成yan（烟），in写成yin（因），iang写成yang（央），ing写成ying（英），iong写成yong（雍）。必须注意：yi（衣）， yin（因），ying（英）都要加上y，别的都是i变成y。因为y不是母音，因此在i，in，ing中不能适用i变y的办法：y，yn，yng中没有母音，不能组成韵母。至于ia变ya，就不发生这个问题。
    u行的韵母前面没有声母，而独立自成音节时，u写成wu（乌），ua写成wa（蛙），uo写成wo（窝），uai写成wai（歪），uei写成wei（威），uan写成wan（弯），uen写成wen（温），uang写成wang（汪），ueng写成weng（翁）。必须注意，wu（乌）加上个w，此外都是u变成w。
    ü行的韵母前面没有声母，而独立自成音节时，ü写成yu（迂），üe写成yue（约），üan写成yuan（冤），ün写成yun（晕）。必须注意：ü行韵母在单独自成音节时，都在前面加上y，在后面把ü上两点省略。
    因此，“意义”要写作yiyi，“烟叶”写作yanye，“英勇”写作yingyong，“语言”写作yuyan，“原因”写作yuanyin，“文艺”写作wenyi，“义务”写作yiwu，“月夜”写作yueye，“威武”写成weiwu。
    y，w能使音节的界限分明，避免混淆。如“礼物”写成liwu，“主义”写成zhuyi，音节界限分明。如果写成liu或zhui，就分不清“礼物”和“留”，“主义”和“追”了。同时又符合我国使用拉丁字母的习惯。如“杨”写作yang，“王”写作wang，都比iang、uang符合社会上流行的习惯。
    22、声调符号是怎样规定的？
    方案中规定的阴平、阳平、上声、去声四种声调符号是采用原来的注音字母的声调符号。声调就是语音的高低升降。北京话的阴平是个高平调，始终均衡，因此用一根平线来表示。阳平是个从中度升到极高的中升调，因此可用从左下往右上的一撇来表示。上声是先降后升的曲调，因此可以用一个v字形的曲线来表示。去声是由最高度降到最低度的高降调，因此可以用由左上到右下的一撇来表示。这四个声调符号大体上表现了北京话里这四种声调的状况。如果把北京话里的声调画成高低升降的图形，那末这四个声调符号基本上符合这种图形的。
    23、隔音符号的用法怎样？
    在一个多音节的词里，有时音节的界限可能发生混淆，可以用隔音符号把它们隔开。如“档案”应该写作dang’an，“单干”才写作dangan；“方案”写成fang’an，“反感”才写成fangan；piao是“飘”，pi’ao是“皮袄”。（完）
