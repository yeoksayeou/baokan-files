Xinhua News Agency reports: Egyptian and Indian and other countries' public opinions strongly criticize the Baghdad Pact's Ankara Conference; at the same time, some newspapers specifically point out the internal contradictions of the Baghdad Pact.

Cairo's "People's Newspaper" published a commentary on January 31st saying that the communique issued by the Baghdad Treaty Council's Ankara Conference showed that the treaty's member states yielded to Dulles's American intentions expressed at the meeting. The "People's Newspaper" asked the Muslim countries participating in the Baghdad Treaty: "Do they recognize that their adherence to this treaty will bring them nothing but disaster?" "News" commented that Dulles firmly opposed the suggestion of turning the Middle East into a neutral zone. However, "The people of Arab countries firmly refuse to recognize the right of the Ankara Conference participants to discuss Middle East issues and interfere in the affairs of this region."

Indian newspapers expressed indignation at the Ankara Conference's interference in Kashmir. The "Hindustan Standard" wrote on February 1st that the mention of South Asia in the communique shows that the Baghdad Treaty Conference did indeed discuss the Kashmir issue.

The "Times of India" ridiculed the statement in the communique that various issues in West Asia should be resolved in accordance with the United Nations Charter as "hypocritical deception" in an editorial. The newspaper also condemned efforts to link the Baghdad Treaty with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The "Times of India" added: "The United States' full participation in the Baghdad Treaty indicates that the possibility of major powers guaranteeing non-interference in West Asian affairs is now smaller than ever."

Israel's "Daily Mail" said: "It is necessary to warn world public opinion to beware of the Baghdad Treaty's decisions aimed at intensifying the Cold War and turning Baghdad Treaty member states into atomic war bases. We should firmly demand that no atomic weapons be deployed in the Near and Middle East region; demand a halt to the arms race and that this region not be included in the competition between blocs." The "Daily Mail" said: "The Baghdad Treaty countries hoped that Dulles' participation in the conference would lead to an increase in US economic assistance, but this hope was dashed. ..."

The tone of Turkish newspapers confirms the statement of Israel's "Daily Mail." Newspapers in that country expressed obvious disappointment with the unwillingness of US Secretary of State Dulles to provide substantial assistance at the Ankara Conference. On the eve of the Ankara Conference, the "Republic Daily" had said that only a substantial increase in "US aid" could save the Baghdad Treaty, but now it has to admit: "Now, the possibility of getting this kind of assistance is even smaller."

French newspapers, in their commentaries on the Ankara Conference, pointed out that there were deep contradictions between the treaty member states. "Le Monde" pointed out that the Ankara Conference was "disappointing." It seems that "Washington and London's two policy decisions for resolving the Near East problem—the Baghdad Treaty and the Eisenhower Doctrine—are increasingly losing their effectiveness. The two Anglo-Saxon governments have shown surprising stubbornness due to not being able to find any other way, a stubbornness that can be compared to a complete lack of imagination."

A special correspondent for "Le Figaro" sent a message from Ankara saying, "The Ankara Conference has confirmed the opinion of pessimists that the effectiveness of the Baghdad Treaty is very small." "It is clear that several member states are wavering between East and West and are looking for excuses to maintain a certain distance. Iraq is doing this on the issue of Israel."

### 各国舆论严斥安卡拉会议  土耳其报纸对美“援”表示失望

　　各国舆论严斥安卡拉会议
    土耳其报纸对美“援”表示失望
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：埃及和印度等国舆论强烈抨击巴格达集团安卡拉会议；同时，有些报纸特别指出巴格达集团的内部矛盾。
    开罗“人民报”1月31日发表评论说，巴格达条约理事会安卡拉会议所发表的公报表明，条约的成员国屈从杜勒斯在会上所表示的美国意旨。“人民报”向参加巴格达条约的穆斯林国家问道：“它们坚持这个条约的结果将为它们带来灾难而没有其他东西，这一点它们是否承认？”“消息报”评论说，杜勒斯坚决反对关于把中东变为中立区的建议。但是，“阿拉伯各国人民坚决拒绝承认安卡拉会议参加国有权讨论中东问题和干涉这一地区的事务。”
    印度报纸对安卡拉会议干涉克什米尔的行为表示愤慨。“印度斯坦旗报”1日写道，公报中提到南亚这件事情，说明巴格达条约会议的确讨论过克什米尔问题。
    “印度时报”在社论中嘲笑公报中所谓要根据联合国宪章解决西亚各种问题的说法是“假惺惺的欺人之谈”。这家报纸还谴责要把巴格达条约同北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织联系起来的努力。“印度时报”又说：“美国全力参加巴格达条约一事表明，要大国保证不干涉西亚事务的可能性，现在比以前任何时候都更小了。”
    以色列“每日卫报”说：“必须预告世界舆论提防巴格达条约旨在加剧冷战和将巴格达条约成员国变成原子战争基地的各种决定。我们应该坚决要求不要在中近东地区配置原子武器；要求停止军备竞赛和不要把这个地区划入各集团竞争的范围以内。”“每日卫报”说：“巴格达条约各国希望，杜勒斯参加会议会导致美国的经济援助的增加，但是这种希望落空了。……”
    土耳其报纸的论调，证实了以色列“每日卫报”的说法。这个国家的报纸对于美国国务卿杜勒斯在安卡拉会议上不愿提供大量援助表示明显的失望。在安卡拉会议前夕，“共和国报”曾经说，只有大量增加“美援”，才能拯救巴格达条约，而现在不得不承认：“现在，得到这种援助的可能性更小了”。
    法国各报在评论安卡拉会议时指出，条约成员国之间存在着深刻的矛盾。“世界报”指出，安卡拉会议使人感到“失望”。看来“华盛顿和伦敦为解决近东问题而提出的两项决策——巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义正在日益丧失它的效能。两个盎格鲁撒克逊政府由于找不到任何别的办法，而表现了令人惊异的顽固，这种顽固可以同完全没有想像力相比美。”
    “费加罗报”的特派记者从安卡拉发来的一条消息说，“安卡拉会议证实了悲观主义者认为巴格达条约的效力是很小的意见。”“很明显，若干成员国动摇在东西方之间并且正在寻找借口要保持一定的距离。伊拉克在以色列问题上就是这样。”
