Two Years of Hard Work Benefiting Ten Thousand Generations
Representative Jia Xinzhai Introduces the Drive and Experience of Snake Tail Ditch Township in Achieving Water Conservancy

I completely agree with the reports made at the conference. Now, I will speak about how Snake Tail Ditch Township in Xixia County, Henan Province, relies on the masses to develop small-scale farmland water conservancy.

Without Water Conservancy, There is No Great Harvest
Snake Tail Ditch Township is a deep mountainous area with large mountains, many ditches, and little and thin land. Due to frequent water and drought disasters (there were three drought years and one flood year in the first Five-Year Plan), agricultural production was extremely unstable. Under the call of the Party, the farmers in this area deeply realized that without water conservancy, there would be no great agricultural harvest. So, they mustered their energy and began to fight for the realization of water conservancy from 1956. After two years of hard work, from the weak foundation of 410 mu of existing irrigated land, with only 0.013 mu of irrigated land per person, they developed to 2,896 mu of irrigated land. The proportion of irrigated land jumped from 13 percent of the total cultivated land area of 3,125 mu to 91 percent, leaping to become a water conservancy township. In the first year of water conservancy, grain production increased by more than 450,000 jin compared with 1955. In the spring of 1957, there was a drought, and in the autumn, there was a long-lasting drought, which seriously affected the growth of crops. However, it still increased production by more than 250,000 jin compared with 1955. This proves that water conservancy is indeed the lifeline of agriculture. The main experiences of this township in realizing water conservancy are as follows:

1.  How to Persist to the End with One Breath
Work hard during the slack season, work a little during the busy season, suspend work during the very busy season, combine water conservancy construction with drought resistance, educate the masses by calculating the benefits of water conservancy, and finally persist through three ups and downs.

First, fully mobilize the masses and constantly encourage their enthusiasm so that they continuously march towards water conservancy. Because the Party branch of this township has a far-reaching water conservancy ideal, they adopted the method of working hard during the slack season, working a little during the busy season, suspending work during the very busy season, and combining water conservancy construction with drought resistance to persist in water conservancy with one breath. In this process, some difficulties were also encountered, namely right-leaning conservative ideas and a slackening mood, unwilling to move forward on the basis of victory. The Party branch took measures to launch movements in response to the ideas of different periods, and after three waves, completed the task of water conservancy. The first wave was from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, when the township, like the rest of the province, carried out a water conservancy movement and achieved 70 percent completion of the water conservancy area. However, there were also some shortcomings at that time, such as drilling three dry wells and building two dry ponds. Therefore, when water conservancy was carried out again in the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, some cadres thought they had lost face, and some masses thought that the water conservancy last year was a waste of labor and a waste of time, only grasping the secondary shortcomings of the past while ignoring the main aspects of the achievements. In response to this situation, the Party branch educated the masses by summarizing the achievements of water conservancy and the achievements of agricultural production, and made a review of the past shortcomings to the masses, and proposed the improved slogan of "three more and one less," namely, opening more canals, digging more ponds, finding more springs, and drilling fewer wells, thus launching a second wave. In this year, another 85 percent completion of the area was achieved. Last year, in the drought resistance and wheat planting, the masses' demand for drought resistance was seized, and the first team of the first cooperative, which had already been water-conserved, was taken as an example to educate the masses by calculating the actual benefits of water conservancy and the gains and losses of water conservancy. This team has 32 households and 130 mu of land. As a result of water conservancy, production increased by 8,000 jin compared with last year. If there were no water conservancy, not only would production not increase, but also in this year's drought resistance, 130 mu of land would require 30 workdays per mu to plant, a total of 3,900 workdays. If each workday was used to engage in sideline occupations, it would only earn 0.5 yuan, a total of 1,950 yuan. The result of the accounting educated the masses, boosted their enthusiasm, and made them realize the superiority of water conservancy, thus launching a third water conservancy wave in the drought resistance and wheat planting. In this wave, another 91 percent completion of the water conservancy area was achieved.

2. Adapt to Local Conditions and Focus on Small Scale
Carry out overall planning mountain by mountain and ditch by ditch, build different water conservancy projects in different areas, and appropriately develop sideline occupations. The masses said well: "Build ponds to eat fresh fish, build canals to eat rice, agricultural production greatly increases, and sideline occupations greatly develop."

Second, adapt to local conditions, adapt to water conditions, focus on small scale, combine current interests with long-term interests, combine water conservancy with agriculture and sideline occupations, and combine eliminating harm with promoting benefits, so that the masses become more and more energetic as they work. First of all, according to the characteristics of this township, adapt to local conditions. The situation in this township is that there are high mountains and abundant water, many ditches and streams, and most of the land is distributed on both sides of the river and ditch, with a sloping terrain, along the river and water, which is suitable for building small water conservancy projects such as opening canals, digging springs, drilling wells, and building weirs. According to this characteristic, carry out overall planning mountain by mountain and ditch by ditch, and build different water conservancy projects in different areas. In the mountain gullies and mountain corners, build ponds, check dams, and reservoirs to store water and prevent drought, and intercept floods. In the riverine areas, build dams, repair weirs, and open canals to divert water to irrigate the land. In the hilly areas, dig springs, build ponds, and drill through-river wells. And combine these projects with sideline production. For example, the first cooperative of this township dug four springs and ponds in the Wawu Mountains, irrigating 87 mu of land, and raising fish in the ponds. Along the river, eight weirs and canals were built to divert water ashore, which can not only irrigate 347 mu of land, but also use canal water for milling, grinding, and papermaking. The masses happily said: "Build ponds to eat fresh fish, build canals to eat rice, agricultural production greatly increases, and sideline occupations greatly develop." Secondly, in the construction of water conservancy projects, small scale should be the main focus, do not like big and dislike small, and combine drought resistance with water conservancy, and combine eliminating harm with promoting benefits. For example, the third cooperative of the township dug a mountain spring with four water eyes in the drought resistance, and the water conservancy technician Li Shuzhao planned to build a large pond to store water for irrigation, which would require more than 10,000 workdays, but there were only 80 mu of land below. After research by the Party branch, it was decided to build a small pond and open two branch canals, which cost 210 workdays and was built in three days, and all 80 mu of land was irrigated. It not only solved the current drought resistance water use, but also ensured the long-term benefits once and for all. The second cooperative of the township drilled five wells in the land, irrigating 87 mu of land, and also managed 14.5 mu of waterlogged land. Therefore, the masses responded very well, saying: "Water conservancy projects are really good, preventing drought and draining water, killing two birds with one stone."

3. Rely on the Masses for More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
Relying on the masses can save money and labor; solve technical problems; and solve money problems.

Third, rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

1. Only by relying on the masses can we save money and labor and achieve the purpose of running water conservancy diligently and thriftily. In running water conservancy, the Party branch of the township adopted the masses' opinion of "no-cost flight" (meaning no capital is needed) and grasped the spirit of running water conservancy diligently and thriftily. In drilling wells, repairing weirs, and other projects, the materials used (bricks, etc.) were replaced with stones, and no bricks were used in 41 wells. In the construction of ponds and other projects, all 120,000 jin of lime used were burned by themselves. In addition, the first and third cooperatives had three canals separated by dozens of feet deep gullies. The cooperative members used tree trunks to make wooden troughs, drilled through with thick bamboo poles, and erected them in the middle of the gullies to divert water to the other side, saving more than 2,000 workdays. The second cooperative diverted a river water over a rocky mountain, so that the water reached the mountainside half a mile high to irrigate 32 mu of land. This is the only project in the township that fired three cannons and spent 0.5 yuan.

2. Only by relying on the masses can we solve technical problems. Because the Party branch of the township can fully develop democracy and raise problems to the masses for discussion when encountering them, problems that have not been solved in history have now been solved in water conservancy. For example, the cooperative members Li Yuzhi and Fu Tingjun tried every means to build the Erdao River Canal. When measuring, they held a thin stick in their mouths and lay on the ground to measure the canal. After the measurement, they encountered the difficulty of crossing mountains and gullies. They adopted the method of building ferry bridges and winding around the mountains, crossing three mountains and building two ferry bridges, and finally realized the water conservancy plan of irrigating 218 mu of land.

3. Only by relying on the masses can we solve the problem of money. While carrying out the water conservancy movement, they mobilized the masses to invest in the cooperative and purchase waterwheels. In the past two years, they invested a total of 2,741 yuan and purchased 11 waterwheels.

These great achievements have inspired the cooperative members' confidence to continue to move forward. Now they have proposed a movement to continue to develop water conservancy and accumulate fertilizer, focusing on renovating the old, in order to completely overcome natural disasters of drought and flood, to achieve the target of 600 jin, and to respond to the Party's call for a great harvest, and are launching a great production movement.

    苦干两年　造福万载
    贾心斋代表介绍蛇尾沟乡实现水利化的干劲和经验
    我完全同意大会上所作的各项报告。现在我就河南省西峡县蛇尾沟乡如何依靠群众，开展小型农田水利的情况作一发言。
    没有水利化就没有大丰收
    蛇尾沟乡是一个山大沟多，地少又薄的深山区。由于常闹水旱灾害（在第一个五年计划里就有三个旱灾年，一个水灾年），农业生产是极不稳定的。这个地方的农民在党的号召下，深刻地认识到没有水利化，就没有农业的大丰收。于是就鼓起干劲，从一九五六年起就开始了为实现水利化而斗争。经过两年来的艰苦奋斗，从原有水地四百一十亩，每人仅有一分三厘水地的薄弱基础上，发展到水地二千八百九十六亩，由只占总耕地面积三千一百二十五亩的百分之十三的水地，猛升到百分之九十一，一跃而成为水利化乡了。水利化的第一年就比一九五五年增产了粮食四十五万多斤，一九五七年春季旱，秋季又久旱不雨，严重地影响了农作物的生长。但还比一九五五年增产了二十五万余斤。证明了水利确是农业的命脉。这个乡在实现水利化中的主要经验有以下几点：
    一、怎样一股劲坚持到底
    农闲大干，农忙小干，大忙暂停，抗旱中结合水利建设，通过算水利化实惠账，教育了群众，三起三伏，终于坚持下来。
    一、充分地发动群众，经常地鼓动干劲，使群众连续不断地向水利化进军。由于这个乡的党支部有远大的水利化理想，所以他们采取了农闲大干、农忙小干、大忙暂停、抗旱中结合水利建设的办法，把水利化一股劲坚持下来了。在这个过程中，也遇到了一些困难，那就是右倾保守思想与松劲情绪，在胜利的基础上不愿再前进。党支部针对不同时期的思想采取措施，掀起运动，经过三个波浪，完成了水利化的任务。第一个浪潮就是一九五五年冬一九五六年春，这个乡和全省一样地开展了水利化运动，取得了水利化面积百分之七十的成绩。但当时也有一些缺点，打了三眼干井，二个干塘。因此在一九五六年冬一九五七年春再开展水利化时，有的干部认为输理了，有的群众认为去年水利化时，浪费工了，做冤枉活了，只抓住了过去的次要的缺点方面，而忽视了主要的成绩的方面。党支部针对这种情况，通过总结水利化成绩、农业增产成绩来教育群众，并对过去的缺点向群众作了检讨，提出了开渠、多挖塘、多找泉、少打井的三多一少的改进口号，从而又掀起了第二个浪潮。这一年又取得了面积百分之八十五的成绩。去年在抗旱种麦中，抓住群众的抗旱的要求，以第一社已经水利化了的第一队为例，向群众算了水利化实惠账和水利化得失账来教育群众。这个队有三十二户，土地一百三十亩，由于水利化的结果，比去年增产八千斤。如果要不水利化，不仅不能增产，同时在今年抗旱中一百三十亩地，每亩需三十个工才能抗旱种上，共需三千九百个工。每个工如去搞副业的话，按五角钱计算仅能得钱一千九百五十元。通过算账的结果教育了群众，鼓起了干劲，认识了水利化的优越性，从而在抗旱种麦中又掀起了第三个水利化浪潮。在这个浪潮中又取得了水利化面积百分之九十一的成绩。
    二、因水制宜小型为主
    要逐山逐沟全面规划，不同的地区修不同的水利工程，并适当开展副业，群众说得好：“修塘吃鲜鱼，修渠吃大米，农业大增产，副业大发展”。
    二、因地制宜，因水制宜，以小型为主，并且把目前利益与长远利益结合起来，把水利和农业、副业结合起来，把除害和兴利结合起来，这样使群众越干越有劲。首先是根据这个乡的特点，因地制宜。这个乡的形势是山高水多，沟多溪多，大部分土地分布在河沟两岸，地势倾斜，依河顺水，适合开渠挖泉打井修堰坝等小型水利工程。根据这个特点，逐山逐沟的进行全面规划，在不同的地区，兴修不同的水利工程。在山沟山旮旯，修水塘、谷坊、蓄水防旱，拦蓄洪水。在沿河地区打坝修堰开水渠，节节引水浇地。在岗坡丘陵地区挖泉、修塘、打透河井。并在这些工程中与副业生产结合起来。如这个乡的一社在瓦屋山腰，挖泉开塘四个，浇地八十七亩，并在塘内养鱼。沿河修堰渠八条，引水上岸，不但可以浇地三百四十七亩，并用渠水打磨、打碾、打对造纸。群众高兴地说：“修塘吃鲜鱼，修渠吃大米，农业大增产，副业大发展。”其次，在兴修水利工程中，要以小型为主，不要喜大厌小，并且要把抗旱与水利化结合起来，除害与兴利结合起来。如该乡三社在抗旱中挖出一个有四孔水眼的山泉，水利技术员李书照要计划搞一个大塘，蓄水浇地，需工一万以上，但下边只有地八十亩，后经党支部研究，确定修个小塘开了二条支渠，费工二百一十个，三天即修起，八十亩地全部灌溉了。既解决目前的抗旱用水，又保证了一劳永逸的长远利益。该乡二社在地中打井五眼，浇地八十七亩，又治理了十四点五亩上浸地。因此，群众反映很好，他们说：“水利工程真正好，防旱又排涝，一举两得”。
    三、依靠群众多快好省
    依靠群众，才能省钱省工；才能解决技术问题；才能解决钱的问题。
    三、依靠群众，走群众路线，贯彻多、快、好、省的方针。
    1、只有依靠群众，才能省钱、省工，达到勤俭办水利的目的。该乡党支部在办水利中，采纳群众的“没本飞”（意思是不要资本）的意见，掌握了勤俭办水利的精神，在打井、修堰等工程上，所用的物料（砖等），以石头代砖，四十一眼井没用一块砖。在修塘等工程上，所用的十二万斤石灰，全部是自己烧的。另外一社和三社有三条渠被数十丈深的山沟隔断，社员们用树身挖成木槽，用粗竹杆打通，架在沟中间，把水引向对岸，省工两千余个。二社把一条河水引过一个石山头，使水上到半里高的山腰中浇地三十二亩，全乡就这一处工程，放了三炮，花钱五角。
    2、只有依靠群众，才能解决技术问题。由于该乡党支部能够充分发挥民主，遇到问题，即提到群众中讨论，所以在水利化中，历史所没有解决的问题，现在解决了。如社员李玉志、符廷俊，为修二道河大渠，他们千方百计地想办法，在测量时用一根细棍衔在嘴里，躺到地上测量渠道，测好后，又遇到了翻山过沟的困难，他们采取了搭渡桥、盘山头的办法，翻过三个山头，搭了二个渡桥，终于实现了浇地二百一十八亩的水利计划。
    3、只有依靠群众，才能解决钱的问题。他们在开展水利化运动的同时，发动了群众向社投资，购买水车，二年来共投资二千七百四十一元，购买水车十一部。
    这些伟大的成就，鼓舞着社员们继续前进的信心。现在他们提出以整旧为主的继续开展水利化和积肥的运动，为彻底战胜水旱自然灾害，为实现六百斤的指标，为响应党提出的大丰收号召而正在开展大生产运动。
    以上发言，如有不当之处请指正！
