    According to a report in the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper: A Chinese man who was abducted to Japan by the Japanese army to perform slave labor, escaped the Japanese military police in the wilderness of Hokkaido, lived alone for nearly thirteen years, and has recently been discovered. This man is named Liu Lianren, 46 years old, from Zhucheng County, Shandong Province. In the spring of 1944, Liu Lianren was abducted by the Japanese army while working in the fields and sent to the Showa Mining Office of the Meiji Mining Company in Hokkaido, Japan, by the puppet "North China Labor Association" to work as a laborer. Because he could not bear the abuse, he fled in June 1945. After escaping from the mine, Liu Lianren, fearing that he would be discovered and killed by the Japanese, wandered in the Ishikari Plain, eating grass roots, yams, and wild beans. In winter, to avoid being discovered by footprints, he "lived in caves" and barely survived on yams and wild vegetables accumulated before the snowfall. In nearly thirteen years, he had never seen a single person. Not long ago, he was discovered by Hakamada Joji, a resident of Tobetsu Town, Ishikari County, while hunting in the mountains. He is now under the protection of the Sapporo City Police Station in Hokkaido and lives in the Ebisutai Inn in Sapporo City.
    Liu Lianren was listed as missing in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Investigation Report on the Accommodation of Chinese Laborers, No. 65.
    According to "Akahata", the Japan Immigration Control Office and the Hokkaido Police Headquarters intend to treat Liu Lianren as an "illegal immigrant." The Sapporo Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Overseas Chinese General Association, and the Committee for Comforting the Souls of Chinese Prisoners of War who Died consider that Liu Lianren is a witness to the Japanese government's violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and its abuse of prisoners of war, and the Japanese government should bear moral responsibility for this.

    逃避日本军迫害　穴居荒野十三年
    难胞刘连仁重见天日
    日本当局企图把他作为“非法入境者”处理
    本报讯　据日本“赤旗报”报道：一个被日本军队掳到日本从事奴隶劳动的中国人，在北海道的荒野，辗转逃避日本宪警，孤身一人生活了近十三年，最近已被发见。这个人名叫刘连仁，四十六岁，山东省诸城县人。1944年春，刘连仁在地里干活时被日军掳走，由伪“华北劳工协会”送到日本北海道明治矿业公司昭和矿业所作劳工，因不堪虐待，于1945年6月逃亡。刘连仁逃出矿山之后，由于害怕被日本人发现而遭到杀害，即辗转流浪于石狩原野，以草根、山芋、野豆等充饥，冬天为了避免被人发现足迹，“穴居”不出，仅靠落雪之前积下的山芋、野菜等物勉强维持生命。近十三年中，他从未见过一个人，不久以前，才为石狩郡当别町居民袴田情治在山中打猎时发现，现在已由北海道扎幌市警察署加以保护，住在扎幌市内惠比泰旅馆中。
    日本外务省的中国劳工收容情况调查报告书第六十五件中，曾把刘连仁注为下落不明。
    据“赤旗报”透露：日本出入国管理事所、北海道警察本部有把刘连仁作为“非法入境者”处理的意图。日中友好协会扎幌支部、华侨总会、中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵委员会等认为：刘连仁是日本政府违反日内瓦俘虏条约、虐待俘虏的见证人，日本政府对此应负道义上的责任。
