Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 26th - President Nasser of the United Arab Republic sharply criticized the Baghdad Pact on the 26th, and stated that he would do everything possible to deal with the conspiracies plotted by imperialism and its agents.

Nasser told tens of thousands of people gathered in Jalla Square across from his residence in Damascus that the Baghdad Pact "is an imperialist treaty, and its purpose is to place our region under imperialist rule."

Nasser said that you have been fighting against all conspiracies from 1955 to the present, "and these conspiracies have only one purpose, that is, to force you to join this imperialist treaty. But each of you knows very well that the Baghdad Pact is nothing but a new form of imperialism with a new guise. Therefore, everyone is determined to fight against this treaty."

Nasser said: "The Baghdad Pact is composed of Britain and the United States, which possess atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, plus some other small countries. Who would believe that there would be equality between the member states of the treaty? A situation like the one existing in the Baghdad Pact can only mean that small countries must be ruled by big countries and follow the policies of big countries."

Nasser said: "In recent years, the Arab people have exercised their right to self-determination for the first time. Before that, we were always ruled by imperialism and its agents, who determined our destiny and established many countries in this part of the world."

Nasser also said: "We have established the United Arab Republic, and we are challenging imperialism and its agents. We are not imperialist agents who accept instructions and money from them."

Nasser refuted Iraqi Foreign Minister Bashayan's claim that the so-called United Arab Republic was built by force. He said that the union of Syria and Egypt was established according to the will of the people. This kind of union is "different from another union that they concocted single-handedly." Nasser said that the kind of union that was created to deal with our union is nothing more than ashes that will be scattered by the wind.

Nasser said: "We are facing a conspiracy jointly manufactured and plotted by imperialism and the Arab traitors who sell themselves to imperialism, but I am convinced that we will do everything possible to deal with them and will be victorious."

Nasser concluded: "We must liberate all Arabs from the hands of imperialism and its agents," "We will continue to fight until the Algerian people achieve independence. The Algerian people have been at war with imperialism for three years, even though imperialism is using NATO weapons. We will continue to fight until the Arabs of Palestine regain their deprived rights."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 26th - President Nasser of the United Arab Republic received a ten-member delegation from the Lebanese National Front Party led by former Lebanese Prime Ministers Abdullah Yafi and Saeb Salam on the 25th.

In his conversation with them, Nasser said, "We face a common enemy, so we must unite. I am convinced that Lebanon will stand with us and all Arabs against the common enemy."

    纳赛尔抨击巴格达条约
    表示要全力对付帝国主义
    新华社大马士革26日讯　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔26日尖锐抨击巴格达条约，并且表示要竭尽全力来对付帝国主义及其代理人策划的阴谋。
    纳赛尔在大马士革对聚集在他住处对面的贾拉广场的数万群众说，巴格达条约“是帝国主义条约，它的目的是要把我们的地区置于帝国主义统治之下”。
    纳赛尔说，你们从1955年起到现在一直在跟一切阴谋进行斗争，“这些阴谋只有一个目的，就是要迫使你们参加这个帝国主义条约。但是你们每个人都非常清楚地知道，巴格达条约无非是一种具有新的形式的新的帝国主义，因此每一个人都坚决跟这个条约进行斗争。”
    纳赛尔说：“巴格达条约是由拥有原子弹和氢弹的英国和美国加上其他一些小国组成的，谁会相信条约的成员国之间会有平等呢？像巴格达条约中存在的那样的情况，只能意味着小国必须受大国的统治和追随大国的政策。”
    纳赛尔说：“在最近几年里，阿拉伯人民第一次运用了他们的自决权。在此以前，我们一向受帝国主义和它的代理人的统治，这些代理人决定着我们的命运，并且在世界的这个部分建立了许多国家。”
    纳赛尔还说：“我们建立了阿拉伯联合共和国，我们在对帝国主义及其代理人挑战。我们不是从他们那里接受指令和金钱的帝国主义代理人。”
    纳赛尔驳斥了伊拉克外交大臣巴沙扬关于所谓阿拉伯联合共和国是用强力建成的那种说法。他说，叙利亚和埃及的联合是按照人民的意愿建立的。这种联合，“同他们一手包办的另一个联合不同”。纳赛尔说，为了对付我们的联合而搞的那种联合，只不过是将被风吹散的灰烬而已。
    纳赛尔说：“我们面对着帝国主义和卖身于帝国主义的阿拉伯卖国贼们共同制造和策划的阴谋，但是我深信，我们将竭尽全力来对付它们，而且将取得胜利。”
    纳赛尔最后说：“我们必须把全体阿拉伯人从帝国主义和它的代理人的手中解放出来”，“我们将继续进行斗争，直到阿尔及利亚人民取得独立为止。阿尔及利亚人民已经同帝国主义进行了三年的战争，尽管帝国主义正在使用北大西洋公约组织的武器。我们将继续进行斗争，直到巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人重新取得他们的被剥夺的权利。”
    据新华社大马士革26日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔25日接见了由前黎巴嫩总理阿卜杜拉·雅非和赛布·萨拉姆率领的黎巴嫩民族阵线党十人代表团。
    纳赛尔在同他们谈话时说，“我们面临着共同的敌人，所以我们必须团结起来。我坚信黎巴嫩将和我们以及所有的阿拉伯人一起反对共同的敌人。”
