One winter surpasses the previous eight years.
Representative Huang Yan introduces the high tide of water conservancy construction in Anhui Province since last winter.

We cannot look at new problems with old perspectives. Anything that can be achieved through effort should be worked for, and new tasks should be proposed promptly and boldly. Strengthen political and ideological work to guide and encourage the masses to move forward. In the cause of socialist construction, it is not the masses who depend on the government, but the government relies on the people, so that money can be used as sparingly as possible and things can be done as much as possible. To complete any revolutionary task, we must show the spirit of hard work, but hard work is not desperate effort. It should be drive plus drilling, courage plus wisdom, setting off a mass technical reform upsurge, so that the labor enthusiasm of the masses can be sustained.

I fully agree with the various reports made to the Congress by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council. Now, I would like to report to the Congress on the water conservancy construction movement in Anhui Province since last winter.

Water management has always been a major event for the people of Anhui since liberation. From 1949 to 1957, a total of 1.476 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work was done in the province's water conservancy construction in eight years (excluding the Huai River project). Many people think this number is not small. However, since last winter, after several months of effort, that is, in one winter, it has surpassed the achievements of the previous eight years. By the end of January, the province had completed more than 1.8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, and had built a total of more than 1.39 million irrigation ditches, enclosures, small reservoirs, gully dams, ponds, and wells, benefiting a total of more than 33.4 million mu of land. Among them, the irrigated area increased by more than 7.8 million mu, the improved irrigated area increased by more than 12.2 million mu, and the waterlogged area was reduced by more than 13.4 million mu. In addition, it can also control soil erosion in an area of ​​more than 970 square kilometers. At present, there are still more than 450,000 water conservancy projects under construction in the province, and several hundred million cubic meters can be done again this spring. Together with the earth and stone work already done in the winter, it can reach more than 2 billion cubic meters. One winter is equivalent to eight years. This is a great leap forward in our province's water management work.

Such large-scale water conservancy construction was impossible under the individual economy; such great achievements would not have been possible without the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.

This great leap forward fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. Obviously, such large-scale water conservancy construction could not be done under the individual economy. At that time, no one wanted to dig up whose land, and many difficulties and contradictions could not be resolved. After the realization of agricultural cooperation, the relations of production changed, and the broad masses of the people were organized, which opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of productive forces. However, our province realized cooperation in the winter of 1955. The past three winters were all winters of cooperation. Why is last winter's achievement greater than the previous two winters, and much greater? This also shows that the great and infinite potential of the people cannot be fully realized if there is only the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of the ownership of the means of production) without the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Due to our victory in the struggle against the rightists and the development of a nationwide rectification movement last year, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of the people has been unprecedentedly raised, and the belief in permanently getting rid of poverty and disasters has become stronger, and the enthusiasm for building socialism has become even higher. This has created very favorable conditions for the great leap forward in production, making it possible for us to mobilize millions of laborers and a large amount of materials to achieve such great achievements in a short period of time.

Using the method of great debate to mobilize water conservancy construction, correct right-leaning conservative thinking and dependence thinking, light up lanterns and torches, and launch socialist competitions day and night.

Of course, good objective conditions alone are not enough. To complete any revolutionary task, we must also give full play to subjective initiative, arouse the revolutionary drive of the masses, and make our revolutionary cause develop more and faster. As mentioned above, there are three different situations in the three winters after cooperation: From the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, under the promotion of the upsurge of cooperation, our province implemented the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership." The province completed a total of 467 million cubic meters of earth and stone work in winter and spring water conservancy projects; while in the second year of cooperation, that is, from the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957, due to our lack of focus, only 278 million cubic meters of water conservancy construction were completed; last winter, we strengthened our leadership and aroused revolutionary drive, and the situation changed again, which is the best proof.

The great rectification movement has enabled the factors of people and politics to play an unexpectedly huge role in economic construction. It has promoted the rapid advancement of various tasks in our province and enabled the province to complete the tasks of grain purchase and anti-drought wheat planting ahead of schedule last year. We seized this favorable opportunity and launched the water conservancy construction movement more than a month earlier than in previous years. The province generally adopted the method of great debate from top to bottom to conduct a comprehensive mobilization of water conservancy construction, enabling the broad masses of cadres and the masses to distinguish important issues such as the purpose, method, and reliance of water conservancy construction, thereby correcting various right-leaning conservative thinking and dependence thinking and improving the enthusiasm for water conservancy construction. After mobilizing the masses, we also widely launched socialist competitions, conducted evaluations and inspections, and promoted the in-depth development of the water conservancy movement. The progress of water conservancy construction and the statistics of the number of workers were announced daily on newspapers, radio stations, and blackboards, and the statistics of engineering benefits were announced every ten days, so that all regions and units could compare. At the same time, visits and mutual evaluations and inspections were organized. These methods played a role in praising the advanced and urging the backward. During the upsurge of water conservancy construction, the highest number of workers in the province reached more than 11.4 million. The average labor attendance rate reached 80%, and some counties reached more than 90%. In order to rush ahead of the winter rain and snow, agricultural cooperative members in many places were "working in the morning with the lights on, and eating with the lights on at night," lighting lanterns and torches, and carrying out construction day and night. Due to the tenacious assault spirit of the broad masses, the progress of the project was greatly accelerated.

In this great march to water conservancy, the broad masses not only demonstrated their revolutionary drive, but also demonstrated amazing wisdom. Under the rising labor enthusiasm, they actively improved tools and improved work efficiency. The pulley soil transporter successfully trial-produced by the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute has been widely promoted throughout the province. The soil transportation efficiency is one to two times higher than manual soil carrying. The masses reflect that it has five major advantages: First, high work efficiency; second, labor-saving soil transportation; third, not afraid of slipping when freezing, the more slippery the more labor-saving; fourth, it can also be done on rainy days; fifth, simple manufacturing and convenient operation. Inspired by this, the masses have created various effective methods. In many places, plows pulled by cattle loosen the hardened soil at the bottom of the ponds and ditches, and then use wooden tools to get soil. The Huaibei area temporarily dismantled the plowshares of double-wheeled double-plows and installed wooden boards or bamboo baskets on them to use as cattle-pulled soil carriers. The deep ditch crane soil transportation method created by Fengtai and other counties has played a great role in improving work efficiency and reducing labor. The average work efficiency of the province (including ramming and other work) reached 2.7 cubic meters, which is more than twice as high as in the past, and some have increased by more than two times.

Once the masses are mobilized, they can generate endless power, and things that could not be done with old eyes are done.

Facts have proved that under the new situation in which the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, once the broad masses are mobilized and organized, they can generate endless power, and many things that could not be done with old eyes are done, and many difficulties that could not be overcome with old eyes are overcome. Taking the funds for water conservancy construction as an example, the state provided more than 13.8 million yuan in subsidies for small-scale farmland water conservancy in our province in the past eight years, and completed a total of 1.476 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work; last winter, according to the central government's policy of "small-scale as the main" and "community-run as the main," all small-scale water conservancy projects were run by the community. The agricultural cooperative adopted the method of extracting accumulation funds for investment, mobilizing community members to raise funds and exchange materials, and implementing labor point unified profit sharing. The earth and stone work completed in one winter exceeded the previous eight years. This shows that not only can more things be done with less money, but even if the state does not spend money, the masses can still do things, and they can do great things. Furthermore, in terms of the number of water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring, our initial plan was 450 million cubic meters, which was increased to 800 million cubic meters after the Third Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee. At that time, it seemed very small; but in fact, the masses completed it all in just half a winter, and now even the 800 million cubic meters that we added for the second time has been exceeded. The lesson this gives us is very profound, just as Chairman Mao instructed us in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," our work in many aspects "has the shortcomings of underestimating the situation, which should be criticized and overcome to adapt to the development of the entire situation. People's thinking must adapt to the changed situation." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's instruction and not look at new problems with old eyes. Anything that can be achieved through effort should be worked for, and new tasks should be proposed promptly and boldly. Strengthen political and ideological work to guide and encourage the masses to move forward. This is one point; in the cause of socialist construction, it is not the masses who depend on the government, but the government leads the people and relies on the people, so that money can be used as sparingly as possible and things can be done as much as possible. This is the second point; to complete any revolutionary task, we must show the spirit of hard work, but hard work is not desperate effort. It should be drive plus drilling, courage plus wisdom, setting off a mass technical reform upsurge, so that the labor enthusiasm of the masses can be sustained. This is the third point. We are absorbing these valuable lessons, seizing the favorable conditions and favorable opportunities created by the great leap forward in water conservancy construction, "striking while the iron is hot," comprehensively launching socialist competition, and promoting the comprehensive leap forward of Anhui's industrial and agricultural production and other socialist undertakings. We strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program in the next five to seven years, and increase the province's grain output from 24 billion jin in 1957 to about 51 billion jin; strive to catch up with or exceed the agricultural output value of our province's weak local industry during the second five-year plan; and make cultural education and various tasks catch up quickly. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to greatly advance the realization of the goals of socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization.

　　一个冬天超过以往八年
    黄岩代表介绍安徽省去冬以来兴修水利的高潮
    不能用老眼光看新问题，凡是经过努力可以做到的事情，就应该努力做到，并要及时地、大胆地提出新的任务，加强政治思想工作，引导与鼓励群众前进；在社会主义建设事业中，不是群众依赖政府，而是政府依靠人民，才能做到钱尽量用得少，事情尽量办得多；要完成任何革命任务，都必须拿出苦干的精神，但苦干不是拼命，应该是干劲加钻劲，勇敢加智慧，掀起一个群众性的技术改革热潮，使群众的劳动热情坚持下去。
    我完全同意全国人民代表大会常委会和国务院向大会所作的各项报告。现在，向大会汇报一下安徽省去冬以来兴修水利运动的情况。
    治水，一直是解放后安徽人民的一件大事。从一九四九年到一九五七年，八年中全省兴修水利一共做了土石方十四亿七千六百万公方（治淮工程除外），许多人都认为这个数字不算小了。但是去冬以来，经过几个月的努力，也就是一个冬天的时间，却超过了以往八年的成绩。到一月底，全省共已做土石方十八亿多公方，已修好沟渠、圈圩、小水库、谷坊、塘坝、水井等工程共计一百三十九万多处，受益土地共达三千三百四十多万亩。其中，增加灌溉面积七百八十多万亩，改善灌溉面积一千二百二十多万亩，除涝面积一千三百四十多万亩。此外，还可控制水土流失面积九百七十多平方公里。目前全省还有四十五万多处水利工程正在施工，今春可再做几亿公方，连同冬修已做的土石方，共可达到二十亿公方以上。一冬抵上八年，这是我省治水工作的一个大跃进。
    在个体经济条件下不可能这样大规模兴修水利；没有政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利也不可能有这样巨大成就
    这个大跃进，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。很明显，这样大规模的兴修水利，在个体经济条件下是办不到的，那时挖谁的土地谁都不愿意，许多困难和矛盾都无法解决。实现农业合作化后，生产关系改变了，广大人民组织起来了，这就为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的前途。但是，我省是在一九五五年冬实现合作化的，过去的三个冬天都是合作化的冬天，为什么去冬的成绩比前两个冬天大，而且大得多呢？这又说明单有经济战线上（在生产资料所有制方面）社会主义革命的胜利，而没有政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利，人民伟大无穷的潜力还是不能最充分地发挥出来的。由于去年我们获得了反右派斗争的胜利和开展了全民性整风运动，广大群众的社会主义觉悟空前提高，要求永远摆脱贫穷、灾害的信念更加强烈，建设社会主义的热情更加高涨，这就给生产大跃进创造了十分有利的条件，使我们有可能动员起千百万的劳动力和大量的物力，在短时期内取得这样巨大的成就。
    用大辩论方法动员兴修水利，纠正右倾保守思想和依赖思想，点起灯笼火把，夜以继日展开社会主义竞赛。
    当然，仅有良好的客观条件是不够的。要完成任何革命任务，都还必须充分发挥主观能动作用，鼓起群众的革命干劲，使我们的革命事业多多地、快快地发展。上面讲过，合作化后的三个冬天，就有三种不同的情况：一九五五年冬到一九五六年春，在合作化高潮的推动下，我省贯彻了“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，全省冬、春修水利工程共完成了四亿六千七百万公方；而在合作化的第二个年头，也就是一九五六年冬到一九五七年春，由于我们抓的不紧，兴修水利只完成二亿七千八百万公方；去年冬季，我们加强了领导，鼓起了革命干劲，情况又起了变化，就是一个最好的证明。
    伟大的整风运动使人的因素和政治的因素在经济建设中发挥了意想不到的巨大作用，它推动了我省各项工作的迅速前进，使去年全省粮食征购和抗旱种麦任务提前完成。我们紧紧抓住这一有利时机，比往年提早一个多月开展了兴修水利运动。全省自上而下地普遍采取了大鸣大放大辩论的方法，进行兴修水利的全面动员，使广大干部和群众辨清了兴修水利的目的、方法和依靠谁等重要问题，从而纠正了各种右倾保守思想和依赖思想，提高了兴修水利的积极性。在群众发动之后，我们又普遍开展了社会主义竞赛，进行评比检查，推动水利运动的深入发展。在报纸和广播电台、黑板报上每天公布兴修水利的进度和上工人数统计表，每旬公布工程效益统计表，使各地区各单位有所比较。同时，还组织观摩、相互评比检查。这些办法，都起了表扬先进和督促落后的作用。在兴修水利高潮期间，全省上工人数最高达到一千一百四十多万人。劳动出勤率平均达到百分之八十，有些县达到百分之九十以上。为了抢在冬季雨雪的前面，许多地方的农业社员都是“早晨吹灯上工，晚上点灯吃饭”，点起灯笼火把，夜以继日地进行兴修。由于广大群众发挥了这样顽强的突击精神，就大大地加快了工程的进度。
    在这次向水利的大进军中，广大群众不仅表现了自己的革命干劲，还表现了惊人的智慧，他们在高涨的劳动热情之下，积极地改进工具、提高工效。省农业机械研究所试制成功的滑车运土器，在全省普遍推广后，运土效率比人力挑土提高一倍至两倍以上，群众反映有五大好处：第一工效高；第二运土省力；第三上冻不怕滑，越滑越省力；第四下雨天也能干；第五制造简单，操作方便。群众在这一启发下，又创造了各种各样的有效方法，许多地方用牛拉犁把塘底、沟底的板土犁松，然后用木?等工具上土，淮北地区把双轮双铧犁暂时拆掉犁铧，在上边安上木板或竹筐，当作牛拉土器，凤台等县创造的深沟吊杆运土法等等，对提高工效、减轻劳动，都起了很大的作用。全省平均工效（包括打夯等工在内）达到二点七公方，比过去提高了一倍多，有的提高了两倍以上。
    群众一经发动起来就能产生无穷无尽力量，用旧眼光看办不到的事情办到了
    事实证明，在社会主义革命已经取得决定性胜利的新形势下，广大群众一经发动，并且组织起来，就能产生无穷无尽的力量，许多用旧眼光看来是办不到的事情办到了，许多用旧眼光看来是无法克服的困难克服了。以兴修水利的资金来说，我省过去八年由国家拿出一千三百八十多万元经费补助小型农田水利，共完成土石方十四亿七千六百万公方；去冬根据中央“小型为主”和“社办为主”的方针，所有小型水利工程全部由社自办，农业社采取了抽出公积金投资，发动社员集资兑料，实行劳动记分统一分红的办法，一冬完成的土石方就超过以前八年。这说明不仅少花钱可以多办事，就是国家不花钱，群众也还是能办事，而且可以办大事。再以去冬今春兴修水利工程的数量来说，我们开始计划为四亿五千万公方，在党的三中全会之后又增加为八亿公方，当时看来是很不小了；但实际上群众只用了半个冬天就全部完成了，现在就连我们第二次又追加的八亿公方也已经超过了。这给我们的教训是很深刻的，正如毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中指示我们的，我们的工作在许多方面“都是存在着对于情况估计不足的缺点的，都应当加以批判和克服，使之适应整个情况的发展。人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况”。我们必须紧紧记住毛主席的这个指示，不能用老眼光看新问题。凡是经过努力可以做到的事情，就应该努力做到，并要及时地、大胆地提出新的任务，加强政治思想工作，引导与鼓励群众前进，这是一条；在社会主义建设事业中，不是群众依赖政府，而是政府领导人民依靠人民，才能做到钱尽量用得少，事情尽量办得多，这是第二条；要完成任何革命任务，都必须拿出苦干的精神，但苦干不是拚命，应该是干劲加钻劲，勇敢加智慧，掀起一个群众性的技术改革热潮，使群众的劳动热情坚持下去，这是第三条。我们正在吸取这些宝贵的教训，紧紧抓住兴修水利大跃进所造成的有利条件和有利时机，“趁热打铁”，全面发动社会主义竞赛，推动安徽的工农业生产和其他社会主义事业的全面大跃进。争取在今后五年到七年内实现全国农业发展纲要，把我省粮食产量由一九五七年的二百四十亿斤提高到五百一十亿斤左右；把我省薄弱的地方工业在第二个五年计划期间，力争赶上或超过农业产值；并且使文化教育和各项工作都迅速跟上来。我们坚信：在中央和毛主席的英明领导下，一定能够大大提前实现社会主义工业化和农业现代化的目标。
