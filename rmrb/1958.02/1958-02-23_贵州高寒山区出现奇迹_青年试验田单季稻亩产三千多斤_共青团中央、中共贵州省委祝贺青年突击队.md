Guizhou High and Cold Mountainous Areas Appear Miracle
Youth Experimental Field Single-Season Rice Yields Over 3,000 Jin Per Mu
Communist Youth League Central Committee and Guizhou Provincial Party Committee Congratulate Youth Shock Brigade
    (Our Newspaper News) According to the China Youth Daily: A single-season rice yield of 3,025 jin per mu, an unprecedented record, has appeared in Daba Township, Yumo District, Jinsha County, Guizhou. The Youth Shock Brigade of the Minfeng Cooperative created this new record. In 1957, they adopted advanced experiences from other places and the experiences of local veteran farmers, and tried to grow rice on 2 mu and 5 li and 9 hao of better land. After the autumn harvest, they harvested a total of 7,835 jin of rice, averaging 3,025 jin per mu (6,399 jin after drying, averaging 2,470 jin per mu), which is more than eight times the average single-season rice yield in Yumo District.
    As early as the spring of 1956, the Minfeng Cooperative established a Youth Shock Brigade composed of fifteen young people. Taking advantage of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the youth built a two-li long canal and converted this more than two mu of land, which was originally used to grow corn, into rice paddies. This matter was supported by the township head and many party members. The captain, Yu Changgui, participated in the county's agricultural technology training class. After returning, he taught all the members the techniques he had learned, such as rice mud-salt water seed selection, warm water seed soaking, new-style seedling fields, and close planting. In the past, this field yielded 390 jin of corn per mu. As a result, in 1956, the rice yield was 1,061 jin per mu, more than 600 jin more than growing corn, increasing the yield by one and a half times.
    However, although some new technologies were promoted in 1956, due to the lack of strong guidance from veteran farmers and the impact of a slight drought, the yield still did not meet the hopes of the youth.
    After the autumn harvest, in order to strive for a greater leap forward in the second year, the Communist Youth League branch affirmed the achievements of the shock brigade, while criticizing the thinking of not respecting veteran farmers and not humbly learning from veteran farmers, and put forward the slogan "Actively unite with veteran farmers and learn from veteran farmers." Seeing that the experimental field had achieved a bumper harvest and that the youth had become more humble, the veteran farmers also changed their attitude and strengthened their technical guidance to the youth. In 1957, the youth and veteran farmers held seven symposiums, which enabled the experience of the veteran farmers and the new technologies to be well combined and practically applied, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest.
    Due to learning from the experience of the veteran farmers, the rice stalks in this paddy field were four chi and eight cun tall when they were about to be harvested. Each ear generally had 380 grains, and the maximum was 420 grains. A total of 7,835 jin of rice were harvested, averaging 3,025 jin per mu. The young people jumped with joy, and the old people also smiled with squinting eyes. The youth said to the old people, "This is your credit!" The old people replied, "No, this is what you did."
    At the end of last year, the county held a four-level cadre meeting to find advanced examples and catch up with the advanced, and found this high-yielding field. Provincial and county cadres, cooperative cadres, and farmers came to visit in batches to exchange experiences. Driven by this event, the entire district launched a movement to build water conservancy projects and turn soil into fields. This year, 31,000 mu of land were turned into fields, which is 53% more than the total number of paddy fields opened in the entire district in thousands of years.
    Is 3,025 jin of rice per mu the limit? No. Now the young people are summing up their experience, checking for loopholes, and planning to apply more fertilizer this year, promote transplanting with manure-covered seedlings, change small-plant close planting to triangular cluster planting, and implement other technical measures to strive to achieve "six eight hundred jin."
    Also Reported: The Communist Youth League Central Committee and Zhou Lin, the first secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, respectively sent telegrams and letters to congratulate the Youth Shock Brigade of the Minfeng Cooperative. The telegram from the Communist Youth League Central Committee pointed out: The Minfeng Cooperative created this achievement in a plateau area 1,000 meters above sea level. This glorious pioneering work powerfully proves that the awakened Chinese people have great strength, and that there is endless potential hidden in the vast land of our great motherland. The grain yield targets of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin proposed in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program can not only be fully realized, but also exceeded and realized ahead of schedule. This pioneering work also powerfully proves that young people have a great role to play in developing agricultural production. As long as we combine courageous creation with humble learning, and combine vigorous revolutionary vigor with conscientious study of technology, every young person can make greater contributions to the great leap forward in agricultural production.
    In his congratulatory letter, Comrade Zhou Lin said: Guizhou is located in a high and cold mountainous area, and the people's lives are relatively poor. However, "poor people have high aspirations." Under the leadership of the party, young people rely on the masses, carefully experiment, and bravely innovate, creating amazing achievements, giving those pessimists who are "poor in ambition," "self-abandoning," and not seeking progress a serious blow. The exemplary deeds of the young people powerfully prove that the production potential of the mountainous areas of Guizhou Province is endless.

    贵州高寒山区出现奇迹
    青年试验田单季稻亩产三千多斤
    共青团中央、中共贵州省委祝贺青年突击队
    本报讯　据中国青年报报道：贵州金沙县禹谟区打坝乡出现单季水稻亩产三千零二十五斤的空前纪录。创造这个新纪录是民丰社的青年突击队。1957年他们接受外地先进经验和当地老农经验，在二亩五分九厘较好的土地上试种水稻，秋后共收稻谷七千八百三十五斤，平均每亩三千零二十五斤（晒干后是六千三百九十九斤，每亩平均二千四百七十斤），相当禹谟区单季水稻平均亩产量的八倍多。
    远在1956年春，民丰社就建立了由十五个青年组成的青年突击队。青年们趁着农业合作化的高潮，修了一条二里长的水渠，把这块原来种玉米的二亩多地改种水稻。这件事情，得到乡长和许多党员的支持，队长余昌贵参加了县农业技术训练班学习。回来后，他便把学到的水稻泥盐水选种、温汤浸种、新式秧田、密植等技术，向全体队员传授了。过去这块田种玉米亩产三百九十斤，结果1956年，种水稻亩产一千零六十一斤，比过去种玉米多收六百余斤，提高产量一倍半。
    但是，1956年虽然推广了一些新技术，但因缺乏老农的有力指导，再加上受了轻旱，产量仍然没有达到青年们的希望。
    秋后，为了争取第二年更大的跃进，团支部肯定了突击队的成绩，同时批判了不尊重老农、不虚心向老农学习的思想，并提出了“主动团结老农，向老农学习”的口号。老年农民看到试验田得了丰收，青年也变得虚心了，于是态度也转变了，并且加强对青年的技术指导。1957年青年和老农开了七次座谈会，使老农的经验和新技术得到了很好的结合。并得到实际的运用，为丰产打下了基础。
    由于学习了老农的经验，这块水稻到快收割时，稻秆有四尺八寸高，每穗一般有三百八十粒，最多达四百二十粒。共收稻七千八百三十五斤，平均亩产三千零二十五斤。年轻人乐的跳起来，老年人也眯着眼笑了，青年向老年人说：“这是你们的功劳呀。”老年人回答说：“不，这是你们干的。”
    去年年底，县里开四级干部会要找先进，赶先进，找到了这块丰产田。省、县干部、社干部、农民一批批来参观，交流经验。在这件事情的推动下，全区掀起一个兴修水利和土变田运动，今年土变田达三万一千亩，比数千年全区所开的水田还多53％。
    亩产水稻三千零二十五斤是否到顶了呢？没有。现在年轻人正在总结经验，检查漏洞，计划今年再增施肥料，推行座粪插秧，改小株密植为三角丛植，并实行其他技术措施，为争取实现“六个八百斤”而斗争。
    又讯　共青团中央和中共贵州省委第一书记周林同志分别致电致信向民丰社青年突击队祝贺。团中央的贺电指出：民丰社是在海拔一千公尺的高原地区创造这个成绩的。这个光辉的创举，有力地证明了，觉醒了的我国人民有着伟大的力量，在我们伟大祖国辽阔的土地里，蕴藏着无穷无尽的潜力。农业发展纲要修正草案中所提出的四百斤、五百斤、八百斤粮食产量指标，不但完全可以实现，而且可以超额和提前实现。这个创举，还有力地证明青年在发展农业生产中，是大有可为的。只要把勇敢创造和虚心学习结合起来，把蓬勃的革命朝气和切实地钻研技术结合起来，每一个青年都可以在农业生产大跃进中，作出更大的贡献。
    周林同志的贺信中说：贵州处于高寒山区，人民生活比较贫困。但“人穷志高”，青年们在党的领导下，依靠群众、精心试验、勇敢革新，创造了惊人的成绩，给那些“人穷志短”、“自暴自弃”、不求上进的悲观论者一个严重的打击。青年们的模范事迹有力的证明了贵州省山区的生产潜力是无穷无尽的。
