　　The propaganda of diligence and thrift in managing the household and living a good life has been going on in the newspapers for a long time. But in the movies, this is the first time, and that is the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio's production "How Do They Live?"
    There is a clear contrast here: the eldest brother and the second brother have about the same salary, and the eldest brother has one more child, but the way they live their lives is completely different. One is harmonious and happy, without lack or worry, and can even save some money to buy a sewing machine; the other is loose at first and then tight, spending all the money at once, and the couple quarrel with each other for the rest of the month. How should one live, after all? People will find the answer from this short film and find a mirror. (Review)

　　他们怎样过日子？
    勤俭持家、过好日子的宣传，在报纸上进行了好久了。但在电影里，这还是头一次，这就是上海科学教育电影制片厂的出品“他们怎样过日子？”
    这里有鲜明的对比：老大和老二的工资差不多，老大还多一个孩子，可是日子却是两个过法。一个是和和美美，不缺不愁，还能储蓄点钱买架缝纫机；另一个先松后紧，一下子花完，到下半月夫妻俩尽闹蹩扭。究竟该怎么过日子，人们会从这个短片中找到答案，找到一面镜子。（复）
