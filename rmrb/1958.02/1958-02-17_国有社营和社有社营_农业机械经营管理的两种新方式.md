Two new methods of agricultural machinery management have emerged at the Beijing Agricultural Machine Tractor Station and the Baiquan Agricultural Machine Tractor Station in Heilongjiang Province: transferring tractors and agricultural machinery to agricultural cooperatives for use and management, and assigning drivers to the cooperatives as commune members. The Beijing Tractor Station adopted the "state-owned and commune-operated" method, where tractors and agricultural machinery are handed over to agricultural cooperatives for operation and use, with the tractor station only collecting depreciation fees, and the machinery remaining state-owned. The Baiquan Tractor Station adopted the "commune-owned and commune-operated" method, where tractors and agricultural machinery are sold to agricultural cooperatives, which then operate them independently with their own funds.

In 1957, the Beijing Tractor Station transferred sixteen plowing teams, fifty-seven (mixed units) tractors, and one hundred and seventy-three drivers to sixteen agricultural cooperatives, including Zhangguozhuang and Tiancun. The tractors and farm implements remained state-owned, and the agricultural cooperatives paid depreciation fees for the right to use them. Expenses such as fuel, repairs, and wages were the responsibility of the agricultural cooperatives, and all members of the plowing teams became commune members. In the same year, the Baiquan Tractor Station sold two Hete 25K tractors and corresponding farm implements and equipment to the Xingye Cooperative (equipment was priced and paid for in three years), and the drivers were also assigned to the cooperative as commune members.

Based on the results of a year of trial implementation in Beijing and Baiquan, initial findings show that agricultural cooperatives independently operating tractors and agricultural machinery have the following benefits:

First, after the tractors are transferred, the producers directly control the means of production, becoming an integral part of the agricultural cooperative's production organization and production plan. Agricultural cooperatives can flexibly utilize tractors and farm implements according to production needs. Compared with the tractor station's contract plowing method, it is much more convenient in terms of arrangement, dispatch, and use, thereby increasing production and income for the agricultural cooperatives. In the past, the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Beijing used to sow one-third of its total wheat acreage after the Cold Dew solar term. After the tractors were transferred to the cooperative, they were able to harvest, cultivate, and sow simultaneously, shortening the sowing time, and basically completing the wheat sowing before the Cold Dew. The Xingye Cooperative in Baiquan used to have no higher grain yields than the surrounding cooperatives. In 1957, after purchasing two tractors, due to timely cultivation and more meticulous farming, under the same natural conditions, grain yields in 1957 increased more than the unit yields of various crops in the surrounding cooperatives, with a total increase of over 130,000 catties. This cooperative increased its income by more than 15,200 yuan in 1957 because it owned its own tractors.

Second, multiple operations were carried out, increasing operating time and workload, and reducing operating costs. In 1957, the Xingye Cooperative in Baiquan County, which purchased a Hete 25K locomotive, operated a total of over 12,000 converted mature mu in nine months, while the same locomotive at the tractor station only had a workload of over 7,000 converted mature mu for the whole year of 1957. The utilization rate of the cooperative's self-operated tractors was 77% higher than that of the tractor station. Due to the increase in utilization rate, operating costs were greatly reduced. The cost per converted mature mu at the tractor station in 1957 was 1.5 yuan, while the cost per converted mature mu for the Xingye Cooperative's self-operated tractors was only 0.77 yuan, half that of the tractor station.

Third, the quality of operations was improved. After the tractors were transferred, the drivers became members of the agricultural cooperative. The quality of their work and the amount of output were directly related to their income, so they were very concerned about the quality of operations, reversing the past tendency to simply pursue quantity. Agricultural cooperatives can also independently make decisions on quality requirements. After the drivers were assigned to the agricultural cooperatives, their personal income also increased. The wage income of the drivers assigned to the Xingye Cooperative by the Baiquan Tractor Station increased by about 30%-40% compared to when they were at the tractor station. They also had private plots, and their families also participated in production.

Fourth, the agricultural cooperatives' public accumulation can be fully utilized, saving state investment and accelerating the pace of agricultural mechanization by relying on the strength of the masses. At the National Conference on Farmland Drainage and Irrigation Machinery and Agricultural Mechanization, provinces proposed that agricultural cooperatives could purchase more than 350,000 mixed units of tractors (equivalent to 130,000 standard units) in the second five-year plan. If all these tractors were operated by the state, it would require an investment of at least about 2 billion yuan. If they are operated by the masses, the state can invest the funds saved into more important construction projects.

The two new methods of tractor and agricultural machinery operation adopted in Beijing and Baiquan have their advantages for these two regions. However, problems such as the supply of materials, technical guidance, personnel training, and repair parts should be promptly assisted and resolved by relevant departments.

    国有社营和社有社营
    农业机械经营管理的两种新方式
    北京农业机器拖拉机站和黑龙江省拜泉农业机器拖拉机站出现了把拖拉机、农业机械下放到农业社使用管理和驾驶员下放到社当社员的农业机械经营管理新方式。北京拖拉机站采取的是把拖拉机、农业机械交给农业社经营使用，拖拉机站只收折旧费，机械仍为国家所有的“国有社营”的方式；拜泉拖拉机站采取的是把拖拉机、农业机械卖给农业社，由农业社出资自营的“社有社营”的方式。
    1957年北京拖拉机站把十六个机耕队、五十七台（混合台）拖拉机、一百七十三名驾驶员下放到张郭庄和田村等十六个农业社，拖拉机、农具仍为国家所有，农业社交付折旧费取得使用权，油料、修理和工资等费用由农业社负责，机耕队全体成员则成为社员；同年，拜泉拖拉机站把热特25K拖拉机二台及相应的农具设备卖给兴业社（机具折价，分三年支付），驾驶员也下放到社成为社员。根据北京、拜泉两地一年来试办的结果，初步摸到农业社自营拖拉机和农业机械有这样一些好处：
    第一、拖拉机下放以后，生产者直接掌握了生产工具，成为农业社生产组织和生产计划的一个组成部分，农业社可以根据生产需要灵活运用拖拉机和农具，和拖拉机站代耕的方式相比，无论在安排上、调度上、使用上都得心应手，因而使农业社增产增收。北京张郭庄农业社过去寒露后播种小麦占全部小麦播种面积的三分之一，拖拉机下放到社后做到了随收秋，随耕地、随播种，缩短了播种时间，小麦在寒露前基本播完。拜泉兴业社往年粮食产量不比周围社高，1957年自购二台拖拉机后，由于作到耕作适时，耕种较前细致，1957年在同样自然条件下，粮食产量比周围社各种作物的单位产量都有增加，共增产十三万多斤。这个社1957年由于自己有了拖拉机，共增加了一万五千二百多元的收益。
    第二、开展了多项作业，增加了作业时间和工作量，降低了作业成本。拜泉县兴业社1957年自购的一台热特25K机车九个月共作业一点二万多折熟亩，而拖拉机站同样的机车，1957年全年工作量只七千多折熟亩。这个社自营的拖拉机利用率比拖拉机站高77％。由于利用率提高，作业成本大大降低，拖拉机站1957年每折熟亩成本为一点五元，而兴业社自营的拖拉机每折熟亩成本只零点七七元。比拖拉机站低一半。
    第三、提高了作业质量。拖拉机下放后，驾驶员成为农业社的社员，他们劳动的好坏，产量的多少，直接和他们的收入有关，所以他们很关心作业质量，扭转了过去单纯追求数量的偏向。农业社对质量的要求，也可自行作主了。驾驶员下放到农业社之后，个人的收入也有所增加。拜泉拖拉机站下放到兴业社的驾驶员的工资收入比在拖拉机站时增加了30％—40％左右。并有自留地，家属也参加了生产。
    第四、可以充分利用农业社的公共积累，节省国家投资，依靠群众的力量加速农业机械化的速度。全国农田排灌机械、农业机械化会议上各省提出第二个五年内农业社可自购拖拉机三十五万多混合台
  （折合十三万标准台）。这些拖拉机如果全部由国家经营，至少需投资二十亿元左右。由群众自营，国家就可把节省下来的资金投到更重要的建设上去。
    北京、拜泉两地采取的拖拉机、农业机械经营的两种新方式，对这两个地区来说是有它优越性的。但是随之而来的物资供应、技术指导、人员培养训练和修理配件等问题，应该由有关部门及时协助解决。
