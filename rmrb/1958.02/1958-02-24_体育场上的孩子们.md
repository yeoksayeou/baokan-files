	Children on the Sports Field
	The moment you step into the gate of Beijing Zhao Dengyu Road Primary School, you are greeted by a sports field, though not very large. The equipment on this sports field is simple. To the east is a soccer field, to the south are horizontal bars, parallel bars, a jumping platform, and a sand pit, and to the northwest is a basketball court. On this small field, hundreds of children happily engage in activities every day. Especially during extracurricular activity time, the small field is filled with people. One group is playing mini-soccer, another is playing on the parallel bars, and in the remaining available spaces, some are skipping rope and kicking shuttlecock.
	Playing mini-soccer is the children's favorite sport in the school. During breaks and after school, a dozen or twenty children kick around on the field. Sometimes they split into two teams for a formal match. While this group is still playing, others are already waiting to take over.
	There are also many people doing horizontal bar, parallel bar, and long jump activities. The children are all competitive, comparing who can do the most pull-ups and who can jump the farthest, which is also very interesting.
	What activities do the younger children do? They have their own ways. In addition to doing various group games, they like to kick shuttlecock, skip rope, and jump rubber bands the most. These activities are simple, easy to play, and don't take up much space. As soon as class is over, groups of children are vying to play in the corners of the sports field and in the open spaces in front of the classrooms.
	Winter has arrived. Teachers and children worked together to splash water on the open space behind the schoolyard, creating a small ice rink of less than forty meters. Many children have bought wooden-soled ice skates. These skates are cheap and easy to skate on. During extracurricular activities, the children would rather give up other activities to skate for a while. The ice rink is small, and many people want to skate, so the teacher divides them into classes, and everyone takes turns skating. Many children have already skated, but they still linger by the ice rink. (Yan Ba)

    体育场上的孩子们
    一跨进北京赵登禹路小学的大门，迎面就是一个面积不大的体育场。这个体育场，设备很简单。它的东面是足球场，南面是单双杠、跳台和沙坑，西北是篮球场。就在这个不大的场子上，每天总有几百个孩子，愉快地进行活动。尤其当课外活动时间，小小的场子里布满了人。这一伙在踢小足球，那一伙在玩双杠，在剩下的仅有的空隙里，也有人在跳绳和踢毽子。
    踢小足球是学校的孩子们最喜爱的运动。每逢课间、课后，一二十个孩子就在场上踢起来。有时他们分开两队来一次正式比赛。场上这一伙还在踢，已经有人在等着接班了。
    作单双杠和跳远等活动的人也不少。孩子们都好胜，比一下引体向上谁来的多，比一下谁跳的远，也是很有趣的。
    那些年纪小的孩子作什么活动呢？他们自有他们的办法。除去作各种集体游戏外，他们最喜欢踢毽子、跳绳、跳橡皮筋。这几种活动简单、容易玩，而且也不占地方。一下课，体育场的角落里，教室前的空地上，一群群的小朋友在争着抢着玩。
    冬天来了。老师和孩子们共同用自己的双手，在校院后面空地上，泼了一个面积不到四十公尺的小冰场。很多孩子都买了木板冰鞋。这种冰鞋又便宜，又好溜。课外活动时，孩子们宁愿把旁的活动放弃了，而去溜一会冰。冰场小，想溜的人多，老师就把他们分开班，大家轮流溜。很多孩子已溜过了，还在冰场旁留恋不去。（燕巴）
