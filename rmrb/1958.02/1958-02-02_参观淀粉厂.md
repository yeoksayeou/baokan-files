　　Visiting a Starch Factory
　　By Our Correspondent Fan Rongkang
    China's Largest Pharmaceutical Industrial Plant
    At the eastern end of the new industrial zone in Shijiazhuang, a large-scale pharmaceutical industrial complex is nearing completion. The Shijiazhuang Starch Factory is one of the first factories completed in this complex. It officially went into production in October last year.
    Standing in front of the factory's magnificent buildings, one cannot help but feel a sense of感慨万端 (literally "ten thousand feelings"). "Western medicine" has been present in China for over a hundred years. Yet, for a century, China did not have a single large-scale pharmaceutical factory capable of independent manufacturing. The history of "Western medicine" sales in China for a century is a history of imperialist powers turning China into a colony. After the Opium War, foreigners brought "Western medicine" into China, marking the first appearance of "Western medicine" in the country. Later, they discovered that labor in China was cheap and that it was more profitable to ship drugs to China for packaging, and to ship powdered drugs to China to be pressed into tablets using tableting machines. They then set up rudimentary "workshops" within their own pharmacies. The once-famous "Anglo-Chinese Dispensary" and "Franco-Chinese Dispensary" developed in this way. Even later, although many pharmaceutical factories emerged in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places, and advertisements for their drugs covered the streets of cities and the walls of rural homes along railway lines, this did not signify the growth of China's pharmaceutical industry, but rather its further colonization. Most of these pharmaceutical factories were unable to produce drug raw materials and could only use imported raw materials to engage in small-scale processing of tablets and injections. The few pharmaceutical factories that produced drug raw materials did not produce them in large quantities in workshops, but rather produced them in small quantities in laboratories through trial production.
    The pharmaceutical industry, an industry filled with humanitarian spirit to save lives and heal the wounded, was in fact a tool for imperialist powers to suck the blood and sweat of the Chinese people in old China. People still remember that more than a decade ago, when scientists discovered that penicillin was an effective drug for treating pneumonia, it was hailed as the "savior of children." However, at that time, China's pharmaceutical industry could not produce penicillin. Penicillin was only available in hospitals in large cities, and it was expensive. How many doctors and how many mothers could only watch their children close their eyes in front of the "savior of children," penicillin.
    In the years since liberation, we have been delighted to see the amazing development of our country's pharmaceutical industry. In 1957, the total output value of the national pharmaceutical industry increased by more than 5.7 times compared to 1952, of which the total output value of the state-owned pharmaceutical industry increased by more than 9 times. Penicillin and chloramphenicol have long been produced in large quantities, and chlortetracycline can also be manufactured domestically. In total, the output of these three antibiotics in 1957 increased by 1,120 times compared to 1952. During the First Five-Year Plan period, more than fifty new pharmaceutical factories and pharmaceutical workshops were built by the central and local governments. The Shijiazhuang Starch Factory is one of the largest pharmaceutical factories among them. The pharmaceutical industrial complex formed by it and two other factories is unique in the country in terms of its scale and advanced equipment. The completion of this pharmaceutical industrial complex has a significant impact on changing the historical situation in which China's drug raw material industry lags behind the drug processing industry, and building China's independent pharmaceutical industry.
    How Great is the Use of Corn?
    The Shijiazhuang Starch Factory uses corn as a raw material for production. Corn is one of the main grains of the Chinese people, and it is usually eaten and that's it. Who would have thought that sending corn to the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory would be so useful?
    Currently, the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory produces two main products from corn. One is glucose, and the other is starch. Glucose is divided into edible and medical grades, and it is an indispensable nutrient for human life and has great value in medicine. Glucose can be injected for physical weakness and indigestion; and if there is excessive blood loss or gastrointestinal problems that prevent eating, glucose is even more needed to maintain life. Starch is the fermentation raw material for manufacturing antibiotics, and it is also the main raw material for manufacturing glucose. In addition, starch has a wide range of uses in industry. The food industry can use starch to make biscuits and pastries, the textile and rayon industries can use starch to size yarn, and the leather industry can use starch to ferment leather.
    In addition to these two main products, the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory also produces four by-products. One is corn steep liquor. This is a fermentation raw material for antibiotics, and it is also a raw material for manufacturing the delicious condiment monosodium glutamate (MSG). The factory is now considering building a workshop, or a small factory can be built locally, to produce MSG. The second is corn oil. It can be used as a lubricant in industry, and it can also be used for consumption. Corn oil is now eaten in many places in Shijiazhuang, and it tastes the same as peanut oil. The third is dried feed, which still contains a lot of fat and protein. It can be used to make wine in industry, and it can also be used as feed for cattle, horses, and pigs. The dried feed produced by the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory is now partially used to feed livestock in the rural suburbs of the city, and partially used to brew wine at the Shijiazhuang Winery. The fourth is waste molasses. This is also a fermentation raw material for antibiotics, and it can also be used in the food industry, or to manufacture high-grade wines such as "brandy."
    Once corn enters the starch factory, every bit of it that can be utilized is utilized. However, corn is, after all, one of the main food crops of the Chinese people, so the source of raw materials is somewhat worrying. After the factory test run in April last year, it was originally planned to put into production in August, but it was postponed by two months due to the lack of raw material supply. The raw materials for the first half of this year have been resolved, but the raw materials for the second half are still being arranged. This makes me think of a question: can we find substitutes to manufacture starch, glucose, and other by-products? It is said that a wild plant called 水蒺藜 (water caltrop) is abundant in the Hebei area, and the Baiyangdian area alone can harvest 40 million catties every year, with a starch content of more than 52%. This is naturally lower than the 72% starch content of the Baima Ya corn from Tangshan Prefecture currently used by the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory; but if it can really be utilized, saving a large amount of corn would be great.
    The Wonderful Production Process
    A young technician from the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory accompanied me on a tour of the entire production process. Seeing many devices that I had never seen before, I truly felt like "Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden."
    First, I looked at the feeding equipment. The train can run along a dedicated line and bring the carriages directly next to the underground feeding storage warehouse. Then, the mechanical shovel is started, and the entire carload of corn rolls into the storage warehouse at once. The corn brought by truck does not require manual operation either, just flip the bottom of the truck and it enters the warehouse. Unfortunately, when the Soviet Union designed this factory for our country, we did not introduce the situation in China in detail. In railway and road transportation in the Soviet Union, corn is bulk packed, and this set of feeding equipment is just right. However, in China, corn is first sewn into sacks and then loaded onto the train. Therefore, this set of equipment has to be left idle, and people have to manually carry the sacks of corn from the train, open them, and then pour them into the storage warehouse. This is also a lesson learned from entrusting foreign design: a large amount of information must first be provided to ensure that the foreign design is in line with China's reality.
    A starch factory uses thousands of tons of corn a year, requiring a warehouse with a large capacity and simple operation. The mechanized warehouse now standing in the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory is as ideal as can be. It has twenty-four round warehouses with a diameter of six meters and a height of thirty meters; next to these round warehouses, there is also a working tower that is more than fifty meters high from the ground and more than sixty meters high from the underground construction, which can be compared with China's tallest building, the Shanghai International Hotel. In this large-scale warehouse, there are fewer than ten workers, and all the work of feeding, discharging, and purifying is mechanized. Grain warehouses are most afraid of grain rotting, but this mechanized warehouse does not have to worry at all. If you want to know the temperature of a certain part of a certain round warehouse, whether the corn has begun to deteriorate, just turn on the resistance thermometer and you can know it like the back of your hand. In case the temperature of that round warehouse is too high and the corn is in danger of rotting, there is no need to panic. Just turn on the machine, and it can automatically transfer the corn.
    The equipment in the production workshop is even more advanced. Walking through the various sections of the starch workshop and glucose workshop, it is quiet everywhere, and there are few workers. All you can see are all kinds of unbelievably large cylinders and jars, some lying down, some standing upright, moving on their own. Various visible and invisible automatic conveying lines send the corn into the workshop, passing it from one process to another, turning it into cakes for a while, thick slurry for a while, and powder for a while. Various products such as starch, glucose, corn steep liquor, corn oil, dried feed, and waste molasses are produced.
    Another feature of the design of this factory is that the structure is very economical. From the outside, it looks like a tall office building. People who do not know the situation will say: "Isn't it a waste to build such a tall building for a factory?" In fact, this is not an office building. The main workshops and sections of the entire factory are located in this "office building." Only a few rooms are actually used for administrative cadres to work in. This design has great advantages: it occupies less land, it is easy to manage, and the factory director can walk through all the workshops and sections without leaving the building. If there are still bureaucrats here who do not go down to the workshops, that would be too outrageous.
    Although the Shijiazhuang Starch Factory has only been officially put into production for a short time, the workers have mastered the production technology very quickly. It was originally estimated that it would take a year for the output of the main products to reach the design target, but in fact it has now been reached. At present, the factory is organizing a great leap in production, planning to exceed the national plan for glucose production by more than 10%, exceeding the design target by 14% to 15%. We must also find ways to increase starch production. The current problem is that we feel that the raw materials are not yet certain.

### 参观淀粉厂

　　参观淀粉厂
　　本报记者　范荣康
    我国医药工业第一大厂
    在石家庄新工业区的东端，一个规模巨大的医药工业联合企业即将竣工。石家庄淀粉厂是这个联合企业中建成最早的一个工厂。它已在去年10月正式投入生产。
    站在这个工厂的雄伟壮观的厂房前面，不由得感慨万端。“西药”在中国出现，已经有一百多年历史了。可是一百年来，中国连一个规模较大的、能够独立制造的医药工厂都没有。一百年来“西药”在中国行销的历史，就是一部帝国主义沦中国为殖民地的历史。鸦片战争之后，外国人把“西药”带进中国，这是中国第一次出现“西药”。后来，他们发现中国的劳动力便宜，把药品运到中国来分装，把药粉运到中国来用打片机压成药片，获利更大，就在自己经营的药房里设起了简陋的“作坊”。名噪一时的“中英药房”、“中法药房”，都是这样发展起来的。直到后来，上海、天津、广州等地虽然出现了许多制药厂，推销药品的广告布满城市的街道和铁路沿线村舍农宅的墙壁上，但这不标志着中国医药工业的壮大，而标志着中国医药工业的进一步殖民地化。所有这些制药厂，大都是不能生产药品原料，只能用进口原料搞些片剂、针剂的小型加工厂。仅有的几家出产药品原料的制药厂，也不是在车间大批生产，而是由试验室小量试制的。
    医药工业，这个充满着人道主义精神的救死扶伤的工业，在旧中国，实际上是帝国主义吸吮中国人民血汗的罪恶工具。人们都还记得，十几年前，当科学家们发现青霉素是治疗肺炎症的特效药后，人们曾尊称青霉素是“儿童救星”。可是那时候，中国的医药工业不能生产青霉素，青霉素只有在大城市的医院里可以找到，价格昂贵，多少个医生和多少个母亲只能噙着眼泪，看着孩子在“儿童救星”青霉素的面前闭上眼睛。
    解放以后的这几年来，我们欣喜地看到祖国的医药工业有了惊人的发展。1957年全国医药工业的总产值就比1952年增加了五点七倍多，其中国营医药工业的总产值增加了九倍多。青霉素、氯霉素早已大量生产，金霉素也已能够自己制造，总计1957年这三种抗生素的产量已比1952年增长了一千一百二十倍。第一个五年计划期间，中央和地方新建的制药厂和制药车间就有五十几个。石家庄淀粉厂是其中规模最大的制药厂之一，它和其他两个工厂所组成的医药工业联合企业，规模之大，设备之先进，在全国是独一无二的。这个医药工业联合企业的建成，对于改变我国药品原料工业落后于药品加工工业的历史面貌，建设我国独立的医药工业，有着重大的影响。
    玉米的用处有多大
    石家庄淀粉厂以玉米作为生产原料。玉米是我国人民的主要粮食之一，通常把它吃掉就完了。谁会想到，把玉米送到石家庄淀粉厂来，会有那么大的用处。
    现在，石家庄淀粉厂用玉米生产着两种主要产品。一种是葡萄糖，一种是淀粉。葡萄糖分食用、医用两种，是人类生命不可缺少的营养素，在医疗上的价值很大。身体衰弱、消化不良，可以注射葡萄糖；失血过多，肠胃积患不能吃东西，更需要用葡萄糖来维持生命。淀粉是制造抗生素的发酵原料，也是制造葡萄糖的主要原料。此外，淀粉在工业上的用途也很广泛。食品工业可以用淀粉制饼干和点心，纺织工业和人造纤维工业可以用淀粉浆纱，皮革工业可以用淀粉发酵皮革。
    除了这两种主要产品之外，石家庄淀粉厂还生产着四种副产品。一种是玉米浆。这是抗生素的发酵原料，也是制造调味佳品味精的原料。现在正考虑由厂里建一个车间，或由地方上建一个小厂，来生产味精。二是玉米油。在工业上可以用作润滑剂，也可以拿来食用。现在石家庄市许多地方都吃这种玉米油，味道同花生油一样。三是干饲料，里面仍含有很多脂肪和蛋白质，在工业上可以用于制酒，也可以用为牛、马、猪的饲料。现在石家庄淀粉厂生产的干饲料，一部分供市郊农村饲养牲畜，一部分拿到石家庄酒厂酿酒。四是废糖蜜。这也是抗生素的发酵原料，还可以用于食品工业，或制造“白兰地”等高级酒。
    玉米进了淀粉厂，真是一点一滴可以利用的东西都利用起来。不过，玉米毕竟是我国人民的主要食粮之一，原料来源倒是让人有些耽心的。这个工厂去年4月试车后，原计划是8月投入生产，但因原料供应不上推迟了两个月。今年上半年的原料已经解决了，但下半年的还在安排中。这就令我想起一个问题：能不能找代用品来制造淀粉、葡萄糖和其他副产品：据说河北一带盛产一种叫水蒺藜的野生植物，仅白洋淀地区每年就可以收四千万斤，含淀粉率在52％以上。这比起现在石家庄淀粉厂所采用的唐山专区白马牙玉米、含淀粉率72％，自然是要低些；但如果真能利用上，把大量的玉米节约下来，那就太好了。
    奇妙的生产过程
    石家庄淀粉厂一个年青的技术员，陪我参观了全部生产过程，见了许多过去没有见过的设备，真有刘姥姥进了大观园之感。
    先看了进料设备。火车可以沿着专用线，一直把车皮送到设在地下的进料储仓的旁边，接着开动机械铲，整车的玉米一下子就滚到储仓里去。用汽车载来的玉米，也不用人工操作，把车底一翻就入了仓。遗憾的是，在苏联为我国设计这个工厂的时候，我们没有详详细细地介绍中国的情况。在苏联的铁路运输和公路运输上，玉米都是散装的，用这套进料设备正合适。而中国是先把玉米缝在麻袋里再装火车的，因而这套设备只得闲着，另外用人工把装着玉米的麻袋从火车上扛下来，打开，再往储仓里倒。这也是委托国外设计的一个教训，必须首先提供大量的资料，才能使国外设计切合中国的实际。
    淀粉厂一年要用几千吨玉米，需要一个容积很大、操作简便的仓库。现在竖立在石家庄淀粉厂的机械化仓库，是再理想也没有的了。它拥有二十四个直径六公尺、高达三十公尺的圆仓；在这些圆仓的旁边，还有一个从地面算起高达五十多公尺、从地下建筑算起高达六十多公尺，可以和我国最高的建筑——上海国际饭店相比美的工作塔。在这个规模巨大的仓库里，工人不到十名，进料，出料，净化等工作全部是机械化的。粮仓最怕粮食霉烂，但这个机械化仓库完全不用担心。你要想知道那一号圆仓里那一个部位的温度如何，玉米是否开始变质，只要开动电阻温度计，就可以了如指掌。万一发现那个圆仓的温度太高，玉米有霉烂的危险，也不必着慌，只要开动机器，就可以自动倒仓。
    生产车间的设备更是先进。走遍淀粉车间和葡萄糖车间的各个工段，到处都是静悄悄的，工人很少。只见各种各样其大无比的筒子、罐子，有卧着的，有直着的，自己在运动着。各种看得见的和看不见的自动运输线，把玉米送进车间，一道工序一道工序地传下去，一会儿变成饼子，一会儿变成稠浆，一会儿又变成粉末。淀粉、葡萄糖、玉米浆、玉米油、干饲料和废糖蜜等各种产品都出来了。
    这个工厂的设计还有一个特点，结构非常经济。从外面看，像是一座高大的办公楼。不了解情况的人会说：“一个工厂就盖这么高一座大楼，岂不浪费。”其实，这那里是办公大楼。全厂主要的车间和工段都设在这座“办公楼”上，真正拿来让行政干部办公的，只有很少的一些房间。这种设计有很大的好处，占地少，便于管理，厂长不出大楼一步，就可以走遍各个车间和工段。如果这里还有不下车间的官僚主义者，那就太不像话了。
    石家庄淀粉厂正式投入生产的时间虽然还很短，但工人们掌握生产技术的速度都很快。原估计要一年时间才能使主要产品的产量达到设计指标，实际上现在已经达到了。目前，厂里正在组织生产大跃进，计划葡萄糖的产量要超国家计划10％以上，超过设计指标14％到15％。淀粉产量也要设法提高。现在的问题是感到原料还没有把握。
