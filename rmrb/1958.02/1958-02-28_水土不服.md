Recently, two comrades who are about to be sent to lower levels visited me and asked the same question: "What medicine should I take to prevent 'unaccustomed to the water and soil'?"

Perhaps because I am a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, the only thing that came to my mind was "Zijin Ding" (Purple-Gold Pill). This is a type of prepared Chinese medicine in pill form. The main ingredients are *Euphorbia pekinensis*, *Typhonium flagelliforme*, realgar, cinnabar, musk... etc. This pill is easy to use. Externally, it can treat carbuncles, boils, and insect or dog bites. Internally, it can treat cholera, heatstroke, damp-heat epidemics, mania, miasma, and being unaccustomed to the water and soil. When used properly, the effect is not bad. Moreover, it is cheap (about six or seven cents per pill). Therefore, it can be called inexpensive, convenient, and effective.

While introducing this pill, it suddenly occurred to me that they were going to Yangzhou and Henan, both places with beautiful mountains and clear waters, with fertile soil and deep waters. How could they be unaccustomed to the water and soil? So, I joked, "It seems you need to bring some 'willpower pills' more than Zijin Ding."

What exactly is "unaccustomed to the water and soil"? Is it right to take medicine or not?

In simple terms, being unaccustomed to the water and soil means getting sick because you are not used to or comfortable with the food and lodging. Because the symptoms are almost always poor appetite, poor sleep, and difficulty working, people commonly call it "unaccustomed to the water and soil."

"Unaccustomed to the water and soil" is not a definitive diagnosis. Because the causes vary, we must not use medication indiscriminately. For example, if living in an area with miasma, polluted water sources, and poor environmental hygiene, and symptoms such as limb weakness, indigestion, edema, diarrhea, and restless sleep occur, and no other suspicious illness can be found upon examination, one can consider using Zijin Ding or other detoxification and heat-clearing medicines for treatment. If it is simply because you are not used to the local life, are careless about staying warm or cool, eat irregularly, or have an irregular lifestyle, then being unaccustomed to the water and soil cannot be cured by medicine alone. Perhaps it will get better without taking medicine. Here is an example: We had a young man named Xiao Meng, a great guy who was proficient in all kinds of sports. Last month, the young man returned from the place where he was sent down because of repeated diarrhea. After chatting with him in detail, it turned out that the young man ate a cornbread made by a skilled artisan that was raw inside and cooked outside. Others ate a little and were fine, but this young man treated his stomach like a pocket and kept stuffing it in, so it was no wonder he got sick. Sure enough, after the diarrhea stopped, he was fine in two or three days, without using any of those pills.

There is also a kind of "unaccustomed to the water and soil" that is man-made. For example, having some small emotions, being dissatisfied, disliking this and disliking that, not wanting to do small tasks and not being able to do big tasks, gradually losing interest in everything, eating without appetite, and sleeping poorly. Due to the influence of unhealthy psychology, the normal physiological functions are disrupted, which can slowly lead to the so-called illness of being unaccustomed to the water and soil. Of course, such an illness cannot be cured even with packages and boxes of Zijin Ding. As the saying goes, "A mental ailment requires a psychological cure." This requires willpower pills. Willpower pills mean: Summoning courage, showing perseverance, comparing the past with the present, thinking about what we should do in the next twelve years. In this way, what are we afraid of when it comes to being unaccustomed to the water and soil!

### “水土不服”

    “水土不服”
    曲祖贻
    最近有两位即将下放的同志来访，不约而同地问起：“带点什么药去防治‘水土不服’？”
    大概因为我是中医的缘故吧，我只想起了“紫金锭”。这是中药成药的一种锭剂，里面主要药物有大戟、毛慈姑、雄黄、朱砂、麝香……等。这锭使用方便，外用可治疮痈毒疖及蛇犬咬伤，内服可治痧胀、暑湿温疫、颠狂、山岚瘴气、水土不服等。用得得当，效果不坏。而且价钱便宜（每锭大约六七分钱）。因而称得起廉、便、验。
    我在介绍这锭之余，忽然想起，他俩一去扬州，一去河南，都是山清水秀、土厚水深的地方，怎么会水土不服？我就开玩笑说：“你们似乎带点‘毅力锭’比紫金锭更需要。”
    “水土不服”究竟是怎么回事？吃药对还是不吃药对？
    用俗话解释，水土不服就是吃的住的不习惯、不合适而引起的病。因为发现的症状差不多都是吃不好、睡不好、干活也不好，因此民间习惯上叫它“水土不服”。
    水土不服不是一个肯定的病名。由于造成原因不一，我们不可不加区别的来用药。比如居于山岚瘴气、水源污秽、环境卫生恶劣地区，发现了四肢无力、消化不良、浮肿、泻痢以及睡眠不安等症状，如果检查不出其他可疑的病，可以考虑用紫金锭或其他解毒清瘟一类药物来治疗。如果仅仅因为不习惯当地生活，冷热不当心或者饥一顿饱一顿，以及生活不规律等所造成的水土不服，就不是单靠药物能治好的，也许不用吃药倒能好。这里有个实例：我们有个小孟，小伙子很棒，运动场上十八般武器样样精通。上月，小伙子因接二连三的泻肚子，从下放地方回来了。我们详细的一聊，敢情小伙子吃了一位高明手艺作的里生外熟的窝窝头。人家吃的少，没事，这小伙子把胃当口袋往里一个劲装，不病才怪哪。果不然泻净了，二三天也就好了，也没用这个锭那个锭。
    还有一种叫作人为的水土不服。比如闹点小情绪啦，不满意啦，看不惯这、看不惯那，小活不爱干、大活干不动，渐渐干什么都带不起劲，吃饭不甜，睡觉不香。由于不健康心理影响，破坏了正常生理功能，慢慢也会造成所说的水土不服的病。当然喽，这样的病，就是成包成打的紫金锭，也是医不好的。俗话说“心病还须心药医”，这就需要毅力锭了。毅力锭，就是：鼓起勇气，拿出毅力，比比过去，看看现在，想想我们在十二年内应该作些什么？这一来，还怕什么水土不服！
